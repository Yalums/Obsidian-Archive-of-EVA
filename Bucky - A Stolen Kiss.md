I woke from up with a start, my head was wet and I realised that I was sweating. My head felt so hot and I had no idea what was going on. I was sitting on something hard, yet familiar. I brushed aside a lock of my red hair and looked up dozily. I was in school, the teacher was rambling on about god knows what and I must've fallen asleep.
我猛地惊醒，发现头上湿漉漉的，意识到自己在出汗。脑袋热得发烫，完全不知道发生了什么。我坐在一个硬邦邦却又熟悉的东西上。我拨开一缕红发，睡眼惺忪地抬头看去。原来我在学校，老师正滔滔不绝地讲着天晓得什么内容，我肯定是睡着了。

I sat up and made myself a little more presentable, I would just die if anyone saw me like this. I know I had fallen asleep but I couldn't explain why I had woken in a sweat. It wasn't hot in the class room and it wasn't outside. Yet I still found myself in a sweaty position.
我坐直身子，尽量让自己看起来体面些，要是被人看到这副模样，我可真要羞死了。我知道自己睡着了，但无法解释为何会满头大汗地醒来。教室里并不热，外面也一样。然而我还是发现自己处于一身汗的状态。

I placed my hand over my forehead and rested my elbow on the desk. As I listened to some of what the teacher was saying I heard whispers from other students one stood out most of all. "This is boring!" I looked over to see Toji Suzuhara, the jock whispering to Shinji Ikari. Shinji didn't answer he just laid his head down and sighed heavily.
我把手放在额头上，肘部撑在桌子上。听着老师的一些话，我听到其他学生的窃窃私语，其中最突出的是一个声音。“这太无聊了！”我转头看到铃原东治，那个体育生，正对碇真嗣耳语。真嗣没有回答，只是把头埋在桌上，重重地叹了口气。

Probably worrying about his experience with the last Angel, the 10th had been a gamble for us all. He was probably thinking what would've happened if he had of missed the stupid thing and let it drop. Stupid Baka should know by now I would've got it! After all I am the great Asuka Langley Soryu and I kick all Angel's asses! The tenth was my kill after all, all Shinji and Wonder girl did was catching it for me, I stabbed it.
可能是在担心上次与第 10 使徒的经历，那对我们所有人来说都是一场赌博。他可能在想，如果他没打中那愚蠢的东西，让它掉下来会发生什么。这个笨蛋现在应该知道我会搞定的！毕竟我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，我踢所有使徒的屁股！第 10 使徒可是我的猎物，碇真嗣和那个女孩只是帮我抓住了它，我刺中了它。

I looked over at him again and I realised he was looking depressed. I think I know why, of course I know why I'm part of the reason. He was staring out the window now, not paying any attention to me, which made it safe for me to stare at him.
我又看了他一眼，意识到他看起来很沮丧。我想我知道为什么，当然我知道为什么，我也是原因之一。他现在正盯着窗外，没有注意到我，这让我可以安全地盯着他。

The reason I suspected was last night. It was late and we were waiting for Misato to get home from a wedding she went to. I knew she was going with Kaji, even though she denied having any knowledge of him being there. I was laying my head on the kitchen table and Shinji as usual was sitting with his back against the door frame listening to that stupid music.
我怀疑的原因是昨晚。夜已深，我们正等着美里从她参加的婚礼回来。我知道她和加持一起去，尽管她否认知道他会在那里。我把头枕在厨房桌上，而真嗣一如既往地背靠门框坐着，听着那愚蠢的音乐。

I don't know what came over me, but at that instant I spoke to him for the first time in hours and the words were something I never thought through. "Shinji, do you wanna kiss me?"
我不知道是什么驱使我这么做，但在那一刻，我几个小时以来第一次对他说话，那些话我从未深思熟虑过。“真嗣，你想吻我吗？”

His response was something I had expected he removed his earphones and mumbled a quick "Huh?"
他的反应是我预料之中的，他摘下耳机，含糊地快速回应了一声“啊？”

I don't know why I continued, I felt funny. I know I should've stopped there when he didn't here my question. But for some reason I had this feeling of determination I don't know why. "You know kissing" I said my head still on the table "have you ever done it?"
我不知道为什么我继续说下去，感觉有点奇怪。我知道当他没听到我的问题时，我应该就此打住。但不知为何，我有一种莫名的决心，不知道为什么。“你知道接吻吗？”我把头还靠在桌子上问道，“你有没有试过？”

"N-no" he answered in his stammering voice, he always seemed to get nervous. Though I hate to admit it I like it when he gets nervous, he's kinda cute like that.
“没——没有”他用结巴的声音回答，他总是显得很紧张。虽然我不愿承认，但我喜欢他紧张的样子，那样挺可爱的。

"Well do you wanna?" I pushed with my playful tone I sometimes used when near him. As I didn't know why I was doing it I came up with a quick excuse "it's nothing really, just a way to kill time." I didn't like it myself but hey it seemed like the thing to do at the time.
“那你想试试吗？”我用平时在他附近时常用的调皮语气追问。虽然我不知道自己为什么要这么做，我迅速找了个借口，“其实也没什么，只是打发时间的一种方式。”我自己也不太喜欢这个理由，但当时似乎是该这么做。

Is next statement shocked me a little, "Y-you're weird, kissing to kill time." That I had not expected him to say, I know he had something for me and I thought he would jump at the chance to kiss someone like me. Any other guy in our school would've killed their mothers for this chance.
"接下来的话让我有点震惊，“你真奇怪，亲吻只是为了打发时间。”我没想到他会这么说，我知道他对我有点意思，我以为他会抓住机会亲吻像我这样的人。我们学校里任何一个男生都会为了这个机会不惜一切。”

Well this answer kicked me right into teasing mode, I regretted the words I said to him but at least they worked. I had said, "oh poor little Shinji, afraid to kiss a girl on the anniversary of his mommies death." I leaned back on my chair and smiled wickedly at him "is she watching you from up in heaven? Or are you afraid?"
"这个回答让我立刻进入了调侃模式，我后悔对他说了那些话，但至少它们奏效了。我说：“哦，可怜的小真嗣，害怕在妈妈忌日这天亲吻一个女孩。”我靠在椅背上，邪恶地对他笑着，“她在天堂看着你吗？还是你害怕？””

Then it happened, I saw something in his eyes that I had never seen before, anger. His eyes weren't as soft and calm as they always were he stood up and almost yelled at me "I'm not afraid, pucker up."
"然后事情发生了，我在他的眼中看到了我从未见过的东西，愤怒。他的眼神不再像往常那样柔和平静，他站起来几乎对我吼道：“我不怕，撅起嘴来。””

Still not sure of myself I stood up and felt my legs threaten to give way, I thought to myself why am I afraid of this? I walked a little closer "did you brush your teeth?" I don't know why I asked it but it seemed to dim the fire in his eyes.
我依然不太自信地站起身，感觉双腿快要支撑不住，心中自问为何如此害怕？我走近了一些，“你刷牙了吗？”不知为何问了这个问题，但似乎让他的眼神中的火焰黯淡了几分。

"Yeah" he nodded nervously, he was as nervous as I was, but I didn't let him see mine.
“嗯”他紧张地点点头，他的紧张程度不亚于我，但我没让他察觉到我的紧张。

I walked up as close to him as I could and said "good here I come." Before I knew it my face was inches from his, he closed his eyes and I began to close mine. His breathe became heavy and it was staring to tickle my mouth I suppressed a giggle when I realised I liked the feeling.
我尽可能地走近他，说道：“好，我来了。”在我意识到之前，我的脸已经离他只有几英寸远，他闭上了眼睛，我也开始闭上双眼。他的呼吸变得沉重，开始轻拂我的嘴唇，我忍住笑意，意识到自己很喜欢这种感觉。

"Stop breathing, you're tickling me" I whispered but before he could answer my request I pinched his nose with my right hand. Before he could complain further I pulled him closer and pushed my lips against his. He was surprised by my sudden aggressiveness and quite frankly I was to.
“别喘气，你痒到我了。”我低声说，但他还没来得及回应我的请求，我就用右手捏住了他的鼻子。在他进一步抱怨之前，我把他拉得更近，将嘴唇贴上了他的。他对我突如其来的主动感到惊讶，老实说，我自己也是。

I spent my first moments licking his lips before he accepted and opened his mouth. His lips were soft moist I liked the feel of them against mine. I pushed my tongue into his mouth and I found his retreating to the back of his mouth. It was scaring him, was it me? Or was it the strange feeling of something new? I knew this was new to me and the fact that I wanted to share it with him made me…I don't know.
我最初的时刻是在舔舐他的嘴唇，直到他接受并张开嘴。他的唇柔软湿润，我喜欢它们贴在我唇上的感觉。我将舌头探入他的口中，发现他的舌头退缩到了喉咙深处。这让他害怕，是因为我吗？还是因为这是种新奇的感觉？我知道这对我是全新的体验，而我想要与他分享这一点让我……我不知道。

I can't remember much more of that particular moment, though I can remember hearing someone moaning with pleasure. And when I thought about it I realised it was me, I was enjoying it. When Shinji pulled back from lack of air and the kiss was broken I stared at him with wide dreamy eyes. He was still gasping for air and for some reason I flipped.
我记不清那个特定时刻的更多细节了，但我记得听到了某人因愉悦而发出的呻吟。当我思考时，我意识到那是我自己，我很享受。当真嗣因缺氧而退缩，吻被中断时，我睁大着梦幻般的眼睛凝视着他。他仍在喘息，不知为何，我情绪激动起来。

I don't know why but I flipped out, I quickly ran to the bath room and turned on the tap. I started yelling things like EW and gross. The one I remember one most of all "I should never kiss to kill time." In the bathroom I was just standing there watching the water drain into the sink, I made gurgling sounds to add affect to my pretend disgust. But in reality I lifted my hand and pressed it softly to my lips, I felt something I hadn't felt before.
我不知道为什么，但我突然爆发了，我迅速跑进浴室，打开水龙头。我开始大喊诸如“好恶心”和“真讨厌”之类的话。我记得最清楚的一句是“我绝不应该为了打发时间而接吻。”在浴室里，我只是站在那里，看着水流进水槽，我发出咕噜声，以增加我假装厌恶的效果。但实际上，我抬起手，轻轻按在唇上，我感受到了一种前所未有的感觉。

In that brief moment of my life I felt safe, like nothing could hurt me ever again. That he would protect me from my pain. In the short time that I shared with him my world fell apart, my pride caved in on itself and I relaxed. I felt…something…possibly even love.
在那短暂的生命瞬间，我感到安全，仿佛再也不会受到任何伤害。他会保护我免受痛苦。在与他共度的短暂时光里，我的世界崩塌了，我的骄傲自负瓦解，我放松了下来。我感受到了……某种东西……甚至可能是爱。

When I was finished the small barrage of comments to him I heard the door open and I stepped out. I was still wondering what I felt for this quiet boy when I heard him mention Kaji. "KAJI I" said with excitement I knew by throwing myself at him I could ignore these feelings for Shinji.
当我对他发表完一连串的小评论后，我听到门开了，便走了出去。我仍在思考对这个安静男孩的感觉时，听到他提到了 Kaji。“Kaji 我”带着兴奋的语气，我知道通过扑向他，我可以忽略对真嗣的这些感觉。

Kaji smiled as he set Misato down in her bed he turned to me and Shinji and sighed "I better be going now."
加治笑了笑，将美里安置在她的床上，然后转向我和真嗣，叹了口气说：“我最好现在就走。”

I quickly wrapped my arms around his waist and looked up at him with pleading eyes "why don't you stay here Kaji?"
我迅速抱住他的腰，抬头用恳求的眼神看着他：“加治，你为什么不留下呢？”

He sighed barley audible "I could never live it down if I went to work like this" he pulled at his dirty tux to demonstrate. He walked out the door leaving me in the hall Shinji followed him and spoke to him about Misato. When Shinji turned back to me he asked if anything was wrong, he said I looked sad.
他几乎听不见地叹了口气：“如果我这样去上班，我永远也摆脱不了这个形象。”他拉了拉脏兮兮的礼服以示说明。他走出房门，留下我在走廊上，真嗣跟着他谈论美里的事。当真嗣转回我这边时，他问我是不是有什么不对劲，他说我看起来很难过。

I was still feeling weird but I wasn't going to let it show, "that's because you kissed me, you jerk!" I fled, for the first time in my life I ran into my room closed the door and fell into my bed. I could feel my inner daemons battling inside of me and I suppressed them, only to fall asleep and to dream…of him.
我仍感到怪异，但不愿表露出来，“那是因为你吻了我，你这个笨蛋！”我逃了，生平第一次冲进房间，关上门，扑倒在床上。我能感觉到内心的恶魔在挣扎，我压制住它们，却只是沉沉睡去，梦见了……他。

A stern voice snapped me back to reality, "where is Ayanami today?" the Sensei asked looking over to the window where the first child always sat. I hadn't seen her in days, which was a good thing. I noticed that where Shinji was staring was the same place Ayanami sat. Was he worried about her? Or was he just thinking?
一个严厉的声音将我拉回现实，“今天绫波在哪里？”老师问道，目光投向那个总是坐着第一个孩子的窗边。我已经好几天没见到她了，这倒是件好事。我发现真嗣凝视的地方正是绫波常坐的位置。他在担心她吗？还是只是在思考？

I hoped he was doing the second thing, I don't know why but the thought of Shinji worrying over Ayanami disgusted me. I grumbled unintelligibly under my breath, I gasped realising what I had just said "Baka Rei." Was I jealous that he was staring where she usually sits?
我希望他在做第二件事，不知为何，想到真嗣为绫波担心让我感到厌恶。我含糊不清地咕哝着，突然意识到自己刚才说了什么，“笨蛋丽。”我是在嫉妒他盯着她常坐的地方吗？

The answer I would find out, I wanted to know theses feelings once and for all. If I cared for him that deeply I would have to show it. If it was just a stupid thing I would shove it aside and forget, but I knew deep down…It wasn't just a thing. It was something…special and I wanted to feel it more.
我终将找到答案，我渴望彻底了解这些情感。如果我对他如此深情，我必须表现出来。如果这只是愚蠢的事情，我会将其抛诸脑后并遗忘，但我内心深处知道……这不仅仅是一件事情。这是某种……特别的东西，我渴望更多地感受它。

A/N: Ok peoples, this is a fic I just wrote for the sake of it. I was watching the episode of 'the kiss' and I noticed the next day Asuka was staring at Shinji during class. I thought of what might have been going through her mind, then altered It a little to give a WAFF feel. If iget good reviews I might continue this through the 12th angel either in Shinjis or Asukas POV you can decide. Personally Id like to see what is going on in Asukas mind the whole 16 hours that Shinji is gone and possibly dead. Come on we all know somewhere she had to have had a heart felt moment for him! Maybe a few uncensored tears ^_~
作者笔记：好吧，各位，这是一篇我为了写而写的同人文。我在看《接吻》那一集时注意到，第二天明日香在课堂上盯着真嗣。我想象她当时可能在想什么，然后稍作改动，赋予它一种温馨的感觉。如果得到好评，我可能会根据第 12 使徒的情节继续写下去，无论是从真嗣还是明日香的视角，由你们决定。我个人很想了解在真嗣消失的整整 16 个小时里，甚至可能已经死亡的情况下，明日香内心发生了什么。我们都知道，在某个时刻，她一定对他有过真挚的情感！也许还有几滴未经掩饰的泪水^_~

Anyway your reviews count towards weather or not I do a prequel
无论如何，你们的评论将决定我是否写前传

Seya on da other side…..
星矢在另一边……

这篇同人文真的很棒，我特别喜欢你从明日香的角度来叙述。哇，我很高兴还有人注意到她第二天盯着他的情景...之前有人说只有我注意到这一点 -_- 总之，这篇作品真的很有感觉，我认为写得非常出色。继续加油！

Umm... Okay, this is certainly interesting.  
嗯... 好吧，这确实挺有意思的。  
  
Your grammar, punctuation and capitalization is a little off, but it doesn't impede the clarity; it merely makes it a little annoying.  
你的语法、标点和大小写有些问题，但并不妨碍理解；只是略显烦人。  
  
OOC is evident... I hardly doubt Shinji would say "Pucker up" when Asuka just commented on his mom, and I hardly doubt that Asuka would even TOUCH on that sensitive of a subject... 'Cause remember, her mother died before, too.  
角色出戏明显...我很难相信真嗣会在明日香提到他妈妈时说‘撅起嘴’，也很难相信明日香会触及如此敏感的话题...因为别忘了，她的母亲也去世了。  
  
The tongue? Moaning with pleasure? Thinking that it's something that she wanted more of? That's... a little blaah. Sure, I'd love to see Shinji and Asuka get together someday, but isn't this a bit sudden?  
舌头？愉悦地呻吟？觉得这是她想要更多的东西？这...有点平淡。当然，我很想看到真嗣和明日香有一天能在一起，但这不有点太突然了吗？  
  
Eh, that's just my opinion... Have a good day.  
呃，这只是我的看法...祝你今天愉快。

This story I liked enough to bother to sign in to leave a signed review... go figure...  
这篇故事我非常喜欢，以至于特意登录来留下署名评论...真是难以置信...  
  
Anyway, nice work with Asuka's mindset at the time, though she seems to be focusing a tad too much on Shinji without pride getting in the way. Though I myself can't say I've ever seen her thinking myself but that's besides the point.  
无论如何，你对当时明日香心态的描写很到位，尽管她似乎过于专注于真嗣，而没有让骄傲妨碍到自己。虽然我自己也没见过她这样思考，但这不是重点。  
  
Little action happening but you told us that ahead of time. Nice work with the grammar and formatting, not too bad.  
故事中动作场面不多，但你事先已经告诉我们了。语法和格式处理得很好，还不错。  
  
I like it. If you feel compelled to continue with an addition to this, I will be forced to enjoy it.  
我喜欢这个。如果你觉得有必要继续添加，我只能被迫享受它了。

[Athos](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/279231/Athos): Interesting. I've enjoyed reading this fic. Comments? Let's say I think Asuka is too much gentle... But it's nothing that bothered me while reading. Good grammar and style. Keep on!  
有趣。我很享受阅读这篇同人文。有什么评论吗？可以说我觉得明日香过于温柔了...但这并没有影响我的阅读体验。语法和风格都很好。继续加油！

Khamel:
Really liked the fic. It's hard to find decent short S/A fics these days, and i also liked your others fics.  
真的很喜欢这篇同人文。现在很难找到像样的短篇 S/A 同人文了，我也喜欢你的其他作品。  
  
Hey, good to hear some fellow melbournians are getting into eva fanfics, i personally hail from Hawthorn and go to Trinity Grammar in Kew.  
嘿，很高兴听到有墨尔本的同好开始接触 EVA 同人文，我个人来自 Hawthorn，就读于 Kew 的 Trinity Grammar 学校。  
  
Where do you live?  
你住在哪里？  
  
Also, do you have any more fics coming up?  
另外，你还有新的作品要发布吗？  
  
If you've stopped writing, i implore you to get back into it. I really like your stuff and a lot of the writers cant even spell half the time. I avidly await your next fic  
如果你已经停止写作，我恳请你重新投入其中。我真的很喜欢你的作品，而且很多作者连一半的时间都在拼写错误。我热切期待你的下一篇作品。

Arcangel:
After reading "A stolen kiss" I thought about if Asuka could really feel like this towards Shinji, the simple answer is yes; what Bucky1 has done here, although not unique, is impressive never the less. He has kept Asuka in character, which is by no means easy, then when the decisive "Kiss" happens, Asuka realises that shinji might mean more to her then she ever thought possible.  
读完《偷来的吻》后，我思考了下明日香是否真的会对真嗣产生这种感觉，简短的答案是肯定的；Bucky1 在这里所做的，尽管并非独一无二，但依然令人印象深刻。他成功地保持了明日香的角色性格，这绝非易事，然后在那个决定性的“吻”发生时，明日香意识到真嗣对她来说可能比她曾经想象的更为重要。  
Bucky1 has also done an above average maintence on Shinji's personna, as Shinji is yet to grow a backbone. What this story needs to be perfect, is it developing beyond a one-shot between Shinji & Asuka and becoming something truly momumental;  
Bucky1 在真嗣的人物塑造上也做得相当出色，因为真嗣至今还未真正成长起来。要让这个故事完美，它需要超越真嗣与明日香之间的一发完结，发展成真正具有里程碑意义的作品；  
for a short one-shot I give it a 8/10, keep it coming Bucky, this could turn out great.  
对于一篇短篇小说，我给 8/10 分，继续加油，巴基，这可能会变得很棒。
