**Author's Update and Note: Yes, I'm fully aware the proper holiday is St. White's Day and not Valentines. Reason for this is to delve into a more familiar holiday without explanations and for the sake of story telling. I'm also aware there's no couch (or visible one) in the actual apartment but for the sake of storytelling let's pretend there is one. I do not mind corrections but the story is about their romance and that is what the focus is. Thanks to whom have stated these errors but I would like to clarify the story is heavily based on their relationship and not about surroundings. The gist (theme) is pretty much the same and the underlying message is still the same. Thanks and enjoy.  
作者更新与说明：确实，我清楚正确的节日应为圣怀特日，而非情人节。如此设定是为了借助一个大家更为熟悉的节日，便于故事展开，无需过多解释。另外，我知道实际公寓中并无沙发（或显眼的沙发），但为了故事情节，我们姑且假设存在。对于指正，我并不介意，但故事的核心在于他们的爱情，这是焦点所在。感谢那些指出错误的朋友，但我想强调，故事着重描绘的是两人的情感纠葛，而非环境细节。故事的主旨（主题）和深层寓意保持不变。感谢阅读，愿您享受其中。

**BitterSweet 苦中带甜  
**

Asuka stared with great hate at Shinji; her grip on her cherry soda can tightened causing the sound of aluminum metal to buckle. Shinji kept his gaze on his plate trying to ignore her; he could feel her temper begin to palpitate from her radiant blue eyes. He knew why she was angry but he didn't want to acknowledge his mistake. He thought if he could just pretend to not remember and she might do the same, however, it wasn't going the way he had hoped.  
明日香满怀恨意地瞪着真嗣；她紧握樱桃汽水罐，力道之大让铝罐发出了扭曲的声响。真嗣则低头盯着盘子，努力不去看她；他能感受到她那双炯炯有神的蓝眼睛中怒火的跳动。他心里明白她为何发怒，却不愿意面对自己的过错。他原以为只要装作忘记，她或许也会跟着遗忘，但事态并未按他的期望发展。

It was a Saturday morning, the glow of the sun hovered into the apartment and the silence that ensued only added to the tenseness that lingered between them. He finished his breakfast, stale bread with a side of rice, and lifted himself to head into the kitchen. As he did so he could fee lAsuka's eyes following him, hoping he thought, that he would do something to bring back the hellish subject of yesterday.  
那是一个周六清晨，阳光悄然洒入公寓，四周的静谧反而加剧了两人间的紧张感。他吃完了早餐——干巴巴的面包搭配米饭，然后起身走向厨房。他能感觉到明日香的目光紧随其后，心中暗想，她或许期待他能做些什么，以便再次触及昨日的棘手话题。

Valentine's Day. 圣瓦伦丁节。

He tried to forget what happened but his mind could only center on the quiet sobs he had heard that night in his room. He couldn't sleep afterwards, the power of guilt, even though, he thought, wasn't supposed to be, was still clinging to the back of his mind like a parasite. It was hard to feel guilt because of her but despite that he could feel a part of his heart regret what he had done, he couldn't even bring himself to look in the mirror that morning.  
他努力想忘却那晚发生的事，然而脑海中始终回荡着房间里传来的隐约啜泣声。这让他夜不能寐，尽管他认为自己本不该有罪恶感，但这份愧疚却如影随形，挥之不去。虽然因她而生的愧疚感让他难以承受，内心深处却有一丝悔意，以至于次日清晨，他甚至不敢直视镜中的自己。

He finished washing his dish and slipped into his bedroom where he dressed himself. Staying in the apartment, he knew, would only cause more problems so his best bet was to escape. He threw on his blazer and poked his head from his bedroom door. He didn't want Asuka to know he was trying to leave; she could use that as a reason to explode on him again. He noticed she was sitting on the couch, her eyes narrow and her brows lowered to a dangerous angle, however, her attention was diverted and this was his chance to make a clean getaway.  
他洗完碗后，轻手轻脚地回到卧室更衣。他清楚，继续留在公寓只会让问题加剧，逃离是上策。他披上西装外套，小心翼翼地从卧室门缝中探出头。他不想让明日香察觉到他的离去意图；她可能会因此再次大发雷霆。他看到她坐在沙发上，目光锐利，眉头紧皱，但此刻她的注意力被其他事物吸引，这正是他悄然离开的好时机。

"Where are you going?" 你要去哪里？

Shinji felt his stomach fall to the floor.  
真嗣感到胃里一阵翻江倒海。

He said to her: "Going for a walk."  
他告诉她：“去散散步。”

"Why?" she replied, he sighed, her conversations were nothing short of cryptic messages just waiting for him to try to decipher. What the hell do you mean why?  
"为什么？"她反问道，他不禁叹息，她的言谈总是充满谜团，仿佛在等待他去一一破解。你究竟想表达什么，为什么这么问？

"It's nice outside," he said, "Why spend it here?"  
外面天气这么好，"他说，"我们何必在这里消磨时光呢？

He knew he had picked the wrong words when she blasted him with, "What's wrong being here? Is it because I'm here?" She was now standing, her long vanilla legs trembling in anger…or was it… fear?  
他意识到自己说错了话，当她怒气冲冲地质问：“在这里有什么问题？是因为我在这儿吗？”她站了起来，那双修长的香草色双腿因愤怒或恐惧而微微颤抖

He then said: "Do you even want me here?"  
他接着问道：“你真的希望我在这儿吗？”

Silence pursued, her blue eyes shot out a glare of immense hostility but also a stare of intense hurt. He could see her strong façade slowly begin to melt away. She sat back down and looked away from him.  
沉默持续着，她那蓝色的眼睛中闪烁着强烈的敌意，同时也透露出深切的伤感。他察觉到她坚强的外表正逐渐瓦解。她再次坐下，目光从他身上移开。

"Fine," she finally said, "Go."  
好吧，" 她最终说道，"你去吧。

Shinji clasped the door handle and turned it; he looked behind him and felt himself well with sorrow as he watched her shoulders begin to fall and rise frantically.  
真嗣紧握着门把手，用力一转；他回头望去，只见她的肩膀开始剧烈地上下起伏，心中涌起无尽的哀伤。

Asuka heard the door close and immediately she felt her eyes pour. She clutched the side of the couch with all her might and buried her face into the cushions. She hated him, she wished he was dead, she wished she could have gone up to him and made him bleed. Her anger seeped through, she could hear herself cursing hysterically but the actual words were muffled by the sofa cushions. How could he be so stupid? How could he have done what he had done?  
明日香听到门砰的一声关上，泪水随即涌出。她紧抓着沙发扶手，脸深深埋进靠垫中。她恨他入骨，恨不得他消失，恨不得冲上前去让他尝尝痛苦的滋味。怒火在心中蔓延，她能听见自己疯狂的咒骂声，却被沙发靠垫捂得含糊不清。他怎能如此愚不可及？怎能做出那样的事？

Suddenly, she heard the front door open again and could hear the clicking of high heels against the floors signaling Misato's return from NERV. Asuka immediately wiped her face and drool from her chin and rested her sore gaze at the television.  
忽然，她听到前门又一次开启，高跟鞋敲击地面的声响预示着美里从 NERV 回来了。明日香迅速抹去脸上的泪痕和口水，疲惫地将目光投向电视屏幕。

"Hey, Asuka," said Misato as she dropped her belongings on table. Asuka said nothing as she tried desperately to conceal her reddish eyes. She didn't want to explain anything; she just didn't have the strength. She waited, hoping Misato would leave just as fast as she came so she could resume her emotional drive; however, it wasn't going to be that easy.  
"嘿，明日香，" 美里边说边把随身物品搁在桌上。明日香默不作声，极力隐藏着红肿的双眼。她无力解释，也不愿开口。她期盼着美里能迅速离去，好让她继续沉浸在自己的情绪中；但事情远没有那么容易。

Misato plopped herself beside Asuka, her uniform replaced by a pair of short jeans and tank top, a beer can in her long fingers and her hair tied in a ponytail. Asuka tried to pretend not to be annoyed but she couldn't help but ask, "What are you doing?"  
美里一屁股坐到明日香身旁，已换下制服，穿着短牛仔裤和背心，长指间夹着啤酒罐，头发束成马尾。明日香虽想掩饰不悦，却还是忍不住问道：“你这是在做什么？”

Misato took a swig of her beer and crossed her legs and said: "Question is, not what I'm doing but rather, what's bothering you?"  
美里喝了一大口啤酒，翘起腿问道：“关键不是我在做什么，而是你有什么心事？”

Asuka felt her hand ball into a fist; she hated being read so easily and without even being looked at. She kept her stare at the television and said nothing.  
明日香感到手不由自主地握成了拳头，她讨厌这种被人轻易读懂的感觉，尤其是对方连看都没看她一眼。她目光紧锁电视屏幕，默不作声。

"How long have you been living here, Asuka?" Misato asked her.  
"明日香，你在这儿住了多久了？" 葛城问道。

"Too long," 太长了，

"That means I know you by now, I can tell your different moods and this one right now is not a common one. What's eating you?"  
看来我已足够了解你，能分辨出你各种情绪，现在这种可不常见。是什么在困扰你？

"Nothing, I'm fine." 没事，我挺好的。

Misato sighed and said: "You're a horrible liar,"  
碇真嗣叹息着说：“你撒谎真差劲。”

"I try," 我试着，

Suddenly, Asuka noticed an unopened can of beer sitting on her lap, "Have some."  
忽然间，明日香发现自己腿上有一罐未启封的啤酒，便说：“喝点吧。”

She couldn't figure out what kind of joke this was, she glanced at her guardian who was now sitting with her back against the couch arm rest and her body horizontal as if getting comfortable for a long discussion.  
她弄不明白这是哪门子玩笑，便瞥了一眼她的监护人，只见她背靠着沙发扶手，身体平躺，似乎在为一场长谈做着舒适的准备。

"Seriously, what are you doing?" asked Asuka as she held the can in her hands.  
"说真的，你在干嘛呢？" 明日香手里拿着罐子问道。

Misato replied, "You risk your life for the sake of humanity, I think you can handle a beer or two. Go on, I won't tell anyone if you don't."  
美里回应道：“你为人类甘愿赌上性命，喝上一两杯啤酒又算得了什么。去吧，只要你不说，我也不会告诉任何人。”

Asuka looked down and nodded, she always wanted to try it. Flicking the can tab, the contents fizzled to the top, almost seeping over the edges she quickly caught it with her lips and tasted the somewhat bitter liquid, "It's gross."  
明日香低头颔首，她一直跃跃欲试。她轻弹易拉罐的拉环，里面的汽水冒着泡涌到瓶口，差点溢出，她急忙用嘴唇接住，尝了一口略带苦涩的液体，“味道真糟糕。”

Misato took a sip of her own and said: "Just drink it; you'll get to like it."  
真嗣抿了一口自己的饮料，说道：“喝喝看，你会慢慢喜欢上的。”

Asuka listened and took a proper sip, Misato continued: "Why were you crying?"  
明日香听后，轻轻地抿了一口，美里接着问：“你刚才为什么哭？”

It was like a sting to Asuka, she hated letting someone listen to her weakness. She hated feeling she had lost control of the situation, "I wasn't crying. It was the TV."  
这对明日香而言犹如一记刺痛，她极不愿让人听见自己的脆弱。她更厌恶那种失去掌控的感觉，“我没哭，是电视的原因。”

Misato gestured her to take a sip and the red-head thusly did so, "Don't try to lie to me, I heard you right outside the door. I never heard you this upset, might as well do what girl's do and talk." Asuka stared at her for a moment and resumed examining the can in between her hands. She could easily say she could give Hikari a call but that would do nothing but confirm she was feeling like crap. She cupped her lips around the rim of the beer and drank plentiful.  
美里示意她尝一口，红发少女随即照做，“别瞒我了，我在门外听得真切。从未见你如此难过，不如就按女孩子的方式，聊聊吧。”明日香凝视她片刻，又低头审视手中的罐子。她大可轻描淡写地说要给光打电话，但这只会暴露她心情极差。她将唇贴在啤酒罐口，痛饮起来。

"It's about that idiot, Shinji," she finally admitted. Misato nodded her head. Surely she already knew that, "He's the last person I would think would hate me."  
她终于坦言：‘这事和那个笨蛋真嗣有关。’美里点头表示理解。她心里清楚，‘真嗣是我认为最不可能讨厌我的人。’

"Why do you say that? I was under the impression that he was quite fond of you." Asuka could hear the no-you-got-it-all-wrong tone in her voice and frowned.  
"你为什么这么说？我原以为他对你颇有好感。" 明日香从她的语气中听出了“你完全误会了”的意思，不禁皱起了眉头。

She took a sip and said, "It has to do with yesterday."  
她抿了一口，然后说：“这事和昨天有关。”

"Valentine's Day," Misato said quickly. Asuka cringed, "What happened yesterday?"  
情人节那天，" 碇真嗣急忙说道。明日香皱眉问道："昨天出了什么事？

"Fine, I'll tell you." 行，我告诉你。

"Shinji?" 真嗣吗？

"Yeah, Asuka?" 怎么了，飞鸟？

The crickets created a symphony of music outside his bedroom window and at nights like this he would forgo his cassette player and listen. It was ironic, he thought, on a night where he didn't have his headphones in; Asuka would want to talk to him. He couldn't help but wonder if she came to his door every night to see if he was listening to his music player. Shinji guessed it was around midnight, the light of the moon entered and cascaded a pane of bright white on him. He found it odd that Asuka of all people was standing at his door, her voice low, almost gentle.  
蟋蟀在卧室窗外奏起了交响乐，在这样的夜晚，他会放弃使用磁带播放器，而是去聆听。他觉得这很讽刺，就在这样一个没有戴耳机的夜晚，明日香会想和他交谈。他不禁怀疑，她是否每晚都会来敲他的门，看看他是否在听音乐播放器。真嗣猜测大约是午夜时分，月光洒进来，在他身上投下一片明亮的白色。他感到奇怪，偏偏是明日香站在他的门口，她的声音很低，几乎温柔。

"Do you mind if I come in?" she asked. Shinji felt himself feel strange, this was unlike her. He said she could and there he watched her slip into her bedroom closing the door quickly but quietly behind her. Shinji couldn't relent his stare; she leaned against his door, her long slender legs brightened by the moonlight. She wore a pair of short shorts and a long baggy t-shirt that he could've sworn did not belong to her.  
"你介意我进来吗？"她问道。真嗣感到有些不对劲，这不像她的作风。他同意了，随后看着她悄悄溜进卧室，迅速而轻声地关上门。真嗣的目光无法从她身上移开；她背靠着他的门，月光映照下，她那双修长的腿显得分外耀眼。她穿着一条短裤和一件明显不是她的宽松长 T 恤。

"What's up?" he asked. She sat beside him, her legs crossed and her eyes set to the lap. He wasn't sure what to say next or if she even say anything.  
"怎么了？"他关切地问。她挨着他坐下，双腿交叠，眼神低垂。他一时语塞，不知如何接话，也不确定她是否愿意交谈。

"How long have we've been working together?" she asked him, her head still focused primarily at her crossed legs. Shinji thought for a moment.  
"我们合作多久了？"她抬头问道，目光仍停留在自己交叉的双腿上。真嗣沉思片刻。

"Wow, it seems like forever. We're lucky there hasn't been an Angel sighting in months. Why?" he asked her now intrigued by the direction of the conversation. She shrugged and suddenly lied down beside him, her long hair forming a pool of darkened red around her head. Shinji said nothing; his heart forbade his voice from speaking. The moment was something he had always wanted, and yet, he felt would never get. She just laid there, words unspoken, her sharp blue eyes maintaining a contest with the ceiling.  
"哇，仿佛过了许久。我们真幸运，几个月来都没再见到天使的踪迹。这是为何？" 他被对话的走向吸引，向她发问。她耸耸肩，忽然躺在他身旁，一头长发如暗红的水池环绕着她的头。真嗣默不作声；他的心扉紧闭，无法言语。这一刻，他曾梦寐以求，却又觉得遥不可及。她就静静躺着，未发一言，那双锐利的蓝眼睛与天花板对峙着。

"Um… Asuka?" his voice mustered to say. Asuka's index finger rose to her lips giving him a "be quiet" gesture. He obeyed trying to figure out her plan.  
"呃…明日香？" 他费力地开口。明日香将食指轻触嘴唇，示意他保持沉默。他依言静默，试图揣测她的意图。

She said to him: "Am I a bitch?"  
她问他：“我是不是很贱？”

Shinji fought the almost uncontrollable urge to say "yes" but he wasn't willing to place himself in a position to become a newly fashioned target for her. He swallowed and said: "You can be overwhelming sometimes."  
真嗣极力克制着脱口而出“是的”的冲动，却不愿让自己成为她新的攻击目标。他咽了口唾沫，说道：“你有时真是让人难以承受。”

A smile overcame Asuka, "So I am, huh?"  
明日香不禁微笑起来，“原来是这样啊。”

He said nothing. 他什么也没说。

She patted the space between her and him and said: "Relax, I just want to talk." He eyed her skeptically and shifted towards her effectively crossing the threshold between friend and lovers. They lied side by side, the silence was deafening, and even the crickets seemed to anxiously wait for the next move.  
她轻拍了拍自己和他之间的空位，柔声说：“别紧张，我只是想聊聊。”他带着疑虑的眼神望向她，身体微微向她靠近，不经意间越过了友人与恋人之间的界限。两人并肩躺下，四周的寂静异常沉重，连蟋蟀的鸣叫也仿佛在紧张地期待着接下来的发展。

"Shinji?" she said. "真嗣？" 她问道。

"Yeah?" 真的吗？

"Have… have you ever been far with a girl?"  
你和女孩子有没有深入交往过？

"Well… uh…" 嗯…这个…

"Don't tell me you've never done anything," she said in a mocking tone, "Have you kissed a girl besides me that one time?"  
别跟我说你什么都没做过，"她带着嘲弄的口吻说，"除了那次和我，你还吻过其他女孩吗？

"No," he admitted feeling heat rush to his cheeks. She got to her elbows and leaned over him. Her eyes reflected off the moonlight.  
"不，"他承认着，脸颊一阵发热。她支起手肘，俯身向他靠近。月光下，她的眼睛闪着光。

She kissed him. 她亲吻了他。

"Don't get any ideas; I'm just preparing you for other girls. Think of it as you owe me."  
别多想，我只是在帮你为其他女孩子做准备。就当是你欠我一个人情吧。

She suddenly shot up to her feet and headed for the door but the moment her hand touched the door handle, Shinji said: "Asuka?"  
她猛地站起身，直奔门口，就在她的手刚碰到门把手的瞬间，真嗣开口道：“明日香？”

"Yeah?" 真的吗？

"Do you do that to help me or do you do that for your own reason?"  
你这样做是为了帮我，还是出于你个人的原因？

"Do what?" 做什么呢？

"You know what I mean, kissing me," he said, "I don't get it,"  
你懂我的意思，亲我，"他说，"我真搞不懂，

"There's nothing much to get," she said, "You owe me for helping you."  
没什么好拿的，" 她指出，"你得感谢我帮了你。

Something in Shinji made him want more answers, he kept continuing into dead ends when he knew very well there was so much more to it. He got to his knees and grabbed her free hand and said: "Tell me what you're planning? You always do this to me, why do you do things like that?"  
真嗣内心深处渴望着更多答案，尽管他清楚前方是死路一条，却依旧执意前行。他跪在地上，紧紧抓住她空闲的手，追问道：“告诉我你的打算是什么？你为何总这样对我，这么做究竟是为什么？”

She pulled away but Shinji didn't relinquish his hold on her. The two of them struggled and as Asuka tried to gain leverage her feet became intertwined with the bed sheets causing her to lose balance. They both gasped and then came a sudden thud.  
她试图挣脱，但真嗣并未放手。两人扭打中，明日香为了找到支撑，不慎让双脚与床单缠绕，失去平衡。两人同时惊呼，随即传来一声沉闷的撞击。

There they were, one on top of the other. Shinji and Asuka stared at one another, eye to eye. He could feel her breasts fitting into the grooves of his chest and she could feel his groin hovering above her pelvis. It was an incredibly tense moment but also a very intimate one. He was prepared for a slap in the face or a barrage of curses but none of that came. Instead he felt her lips encase his, at first he couldn't understand what was happening, rather, _was_ it really happening?  
他们就这样，一个叠在另一个之上。真嗣与明日香四目相对，彼此凝视。他能感受到她的胸部紧贴着他胸前的凹陷，而她也能察觉到他的下身悬停在她的骨盆之上。这时刻既紧张又亲密。他已做好准备迎接一记耳光或是连珠炮似的咒骂，然而这些都未曾到来。取而代之的是，她的唇紧紧地贴上了他的，起初他难以置信，这真的正在发生吗？

He smelled her, she smelled of a honey based shampoo no doubt she used religiously. Her lips were warm and each kiss she stole from him sent a rush of pure ecstasy running through his brittle veins. As each second passed she became more aggressive and more wanting, she began to nibble at his lips and soon began to engulf him. Her hands shot up to his head and began to lace themselves within his brown hair. He could feel her breathing begin to grow unsteady and before he knew it he was mimicking every single thing she was doing. It was like someone literally flipped a switch within awakening months of suppressed feelings.  
他嗅到了她的香气，那无疑是她虔诚使用的蜂蜜洗发水。她的唇温暖如春，每一次她偷吻他，都让他感到一阵纯粹的狂喜流遍全身。随着时间的推移，她变得更加主动和渴望，开始轻咬他的唇，不久便将他完全吞噬。她的手迅速攀上他的头，手指缠绕在他的棕发中。他能感觉到她的呼吸变得急促，不知不觉间，他开始模仿她的每一个动作。仿佛有人在他内心深处按下了开关，唤醒了数月来压抑的情感。

She had to be honest with herself, she felt like an idiot. She felt her inner wants and emotions begin to claw at her façade like a beast through a paper thin wall and there was nothing she could do to force it back into submission.  
她必须坦诚面对自己，感觉自己像个傻子。内心的欲望和情感如同野兽撕裂薄纸墙一般，开始撕扯她的伪装，她却束手无策，无法将其重新压制。

Then everything stopped. 随后，一切戛然而止。

Asuka rose to her feet and turned to the door, not a single word escaping her moist lips. Shinji stared, a sudden rush of frustration rose within him. He felt used as always, she had always used him some way or another for a certain purpose but to what extent he could never find out. He tried to reach out for her, to make her stay, but she used her nimble physique to squeeze through the door and out into the hall. He suppressed his urge to follow and sat there. Something told him his relationship with Asuka just became even more complex.  
明日香站起身，转向门口，湿润的嘴唇紧闭着。真嗣目不转睛，突然间一股挫败感涌上心头。他觉得自己又被利用了，她总是以某种方式利用他达成某个目的，但具体到何种程度，他始终无法弄清。他试图伸手挽留，希望她留下，但她灵活地穿过门缝，消失在走廊里。他克制住追出去的冲动，静静地坐着。一种直觉告诉他，他与明日香的关系变得更加错综复杂了。

That morning Shinji walked alone to school, he noticed Asuka's bedroom door opened and all her school belongings had vanished indicating she had left before him. He walked slowly, he normally didn't have any need to get to school in any time frame but now his stomach ushered in a sense of anxiety. He didn't know what would meet him when he got there. Would it be an angry Asuka? A happy one? Would she ignore him? Would she be nice? He sighed. The most annoying thing about her was that her personality was hard to predict and even harder to understand. It could go either way.  
那天清晨，真嗣孤身前往学校，发现明日香的房门大开，她的学习用品已无踪影，显然她比他早一步离开了。他步履缓慢，往常他无需匆忙赶往学校，此刻却感到胃中一阵不安。他无法预料到校后会面对什么。明日香会怒气冲冲吗？还是满面笑容？她会选择无视他吗？抑或对他和颜悦色？他轻叹一声。她最令人头疼的，便是那难以捉摸且难以理解的性格，一切皆有可能。

He found himself moments later roaming the corridors and routinely taking the same route he had always done. Once he reached his class he noticed an army of eyes staring at him and then at the red-headed girl sitting towards the back of the room as if they could sense a sudden shift in power. Shinji glanced at Asuka who did nothing but exhume her supplies out of her bag. She seemed not to notice anyone and her expression was dull as if she was lost in her own mind. His stomach tensed but he managed to find the strength to sit down. Today was going to be hell.  
不久后，他发现自己像往常一样在走廊里徘徊，沿着熟悉的路线前行。抵达教室时，他察觉到众人的目光先是集中在他身上，随后又转向教室后排那位红发女孩，仿佛大家都能感受到某种权力的微妙变化。真嗣瞥了一眼明日香，她正默默地从包里取出学习用品，对周围的一切似乎浑然不觉，表情木然，仿佛陷入了自己的世界。他的胃不由得紧缩，但还是鼓起勇气坐了下来。今天注定是难熬的一天。

Lunch period came, everyone stood to leave to their own separate locations but he always found it suitable to stay at his desk. From the corner of his eye he could see Hikari, Asuka's best friend, walk up to her and ask her to join her for lunch like normal.  
午餐时间一到，众人纷纷起身前往各自的去处，而他却习惯性地留在办公桌旁。不经意间，他瞥见明日香的好友光走向她，一如往常地邀请她共进午餐。

He was stunned when she said "no".  
她口中吐出“不”字时，他愣住了。

He was also surprised how easily Hikari submitted to the rejection and vanished, leaving Asuka and him completely alone in the room. He sat a row ahead of her but he did not dare look back. He didn't want to escort a random assortment of curses and belittling phrases for just a mere glance. He placed his bag on his desk and began to withdraw random supplies, his appetite was scarce and he needed something to keep himself busy until the period was over.  
他同样惊讶于光如此轻易地接受拒绝并消失，使得房间里只剩下他和明日香。他坐在她前面一排，却不敢回头。他不想因为一个眼神就引来一连串的咒骂和贬低。他将书包放在桌上，开始随意拿出一些文具，食欲不振的他需要找些事情来打发时间，直到下课。

Suddenly, Asuka hovered beside him. His head jerked towards her and he felt himself nearly fall from his seat. That was a nasty habit she possessed and it always made him uneasy. She pushed his things off the desk and said nothing as she sat herself where his things once were. Shinji stared; he could see her bare thigh flesh only inches from him.  
突然，明日香飘然来到他身旁。他猛地转头看向她，差点从座位上跌落。她这坏习惯总让他心神不宁。她将他的物品推下桌面，随后默不作声地坐在了那些物品原来的位置。真嗣愣住了；他清晰地看到她裸露的大腿肌肤近在咫尺。

She then said to him: "You hungry?"  
她随后问他："你饿了吗？"

He wasn't but he didn't want to say no either. She still maintained a void expression on her face but she whipped her own bag off her shoulder and dug into it. Shinji watched in fascination, what was she planning? She pulled out a plastic bin, within it was several homemade items, and she sat it right in front of him and pried the lid off letting the mouthwatering aroma to seep out. Shinji was beyond amazed, how she of all people could prepare something so extravagant when she herself couldn't pour cereal without getting it everywhere?  
他虽未明言拒绝，却也不愿直说。她面无表情，却迅速从肩上取下自己的包，伸手探入其中。真嗣好奇地注视着，她究竟有何打算？她拿出一个塑料盒，里面装着几样自制佳肴，直接摆在他面前，打开盖子，让那令人垂涎的香气弥漫开来。真嗣大为惊讶，她这样连倒麦片都会弄得一团糟的人，竟能做出如此精美的食物？

Before he could ask she said: "I came early and had one of those cooking students help me make this. A little persuading never hurt anyone." Shinji wholeheartedly doubted she did a "little" persuading, he could imagine her grabbing the collar of some poor kid and threatening them with her mighty fist but there was no use trying to think of it now.  
他还没开口，她便说道：“我提前来了，找了个烹饪班的学生帮忙做的。稍微劝说一下，对谁都没坏处。”真嗣心里清楚，她所谓的“稍微”说服，恐怕是揪着某个学生的衣领，用她那有力的拳头威逼利诱。不过，现在想这些也无济于事。

He couldn't help but ask, "Why are you doing this for me?"  
他情不自禁地问：“你为何要为我这么做？”

He finally managed to get an expressional response from her but not necessarily the one he was looking for. She eyed him angrily and took the bin and said: "If you don't want it then give it back… moron."  
他总算从她那里得到了回应，却并非他所期望的。她怒目而视，拿起垃圾桶说道：“不想要就还给我……傻瓜。”

He blinked; at least she wasn't too far off from her original self.  
他眨了眨眼，还好，她并没有变得面目全非。

She got herself up from the desk and replaced the bin before him. She went back into her bag and took out a small envelope and handed it to him.  
她从桌旁起身，替他更换了垃圾桶。接着，她从包里拿出一个小信封，递给了他。

"What's this?" he asked. "这是什么？" 他问。

She looked away, clearly uneasy about talking about it, "Um, just show up if you want. Tomorrow's Valentine's Day and I thought it would… be nice…" Without saying another word she bolted from the room. Shinji felt as if he had stepped into the wrong dimension and was witnessing an alternate reality. The envelope he held was thin; he lifted the tab and took out two tickets.  
她转过头，显然对提及此事感到不安，“嗯，你要是想来就来吧。明天是情人节，我觉得……应该挺好的……”她没再多说，便匆匆离开了房间。真嗣感觉自己像是误入了另一个维度，目睹了一场平行世界的景象。他手中的信封很薄，他拉开封口，里面是两张票。

"A concert? Seriously?" 音乐会？真的假的？

Asuka punched her locker furiously, her bag fell to the ground and all her books shuffled out. She buried her face in her hands and said to Hikari, "Why the hell did you make me do that?"  
明日香怒气冲冲地猛击储物柜，书包落地，书本散落一地。她双手捂脸，质问光：“你干嘛非要我这么做？”

Her friend responded, "Relax, if he's smart he'll get the hint. It's only embarrassing because you're not used to doing something like that." She tried to take in what she said as truth but another point entered her thoughts.  
她的朋友安慰道：“别紧张，他要是机灵，自然能领会你的意思。感到尴尬，不过是因为你还不习惯这种做法。”她本想接受这番话为真，却又有一个念头闪过脑海。

"But that's not me," she said, "He knows something's off, that's not me. I'm not nice to him! Especially about last ni-"  
但那并非真实的我，"她辩解道，"他感觉到异样，那绝非我本意。我对他的态度并不和善！尤其是提到昨晚的事时-

Asuka cupped her mouth, her blue eyes enlarged as she slowly turned her gaze to Hikari who starred with a curious expression.  
明日香捂着嘴，蓝眼睛瞪得溜圆，她慢慢把视线转向光，光则带着好奇的神情注视着她。

"What _did_ happen last night?" she asked Asuka. Asuka sighed and stared miserably at the ceiling of the girl's locker room.  
她向明日香询问：“昨晚到底发生了什么？”明日香叹息一声，神情沮丧地望着女子更衣室的天花板。

"Nothing," she lied. Hikari wasn't satisfied but knew a losing battle when she saw one. She further explained to Asuka the reasoning behind her plan. As far as Asuka was concerned, Hikari was the only one who knew of her feelings for Shinji.  
"没什么，"她撒谎说。光虽然不满，但也清楚何时该收手。她继续向明日香阐述自己计划的道理。对明日香来说，光是唯一了解她对真嗣情感的人。

Hikari then said: "Listen, it's really not that hard. Just get to the boardwalk and wait for him. You told him to show up and when he does it will just be the two of you. No interruptions. You can be yourself."  
光接着说：“听着，这事儿真不难。你只需到木板路那儿等他。你已经叫他来了，他一到，就只有你们俩，没人打扰。你可以自在地做自己。”

Asuka stared. 明日香目不转睛地盯着。

"Well…" Hikari continued, "To some extent."  
嗯…"光接着说，"多少有点儿。

Shinji didn't go straight home that afternoon, he took a detour into the city with Toji, a once feared enemy turned friend. Recently the two of them had been hanging around the arcade with a bunch of other guys but for some odd reason they found each other discussing more personal matters than usual. He wasn't particularly surprised when Toji told him he had a crush on Hikari. Shinji had always suspected it but never shared his opinion in fear he might tear the delicate friendship fabric they began to weave.  
那天下午，真嗣没有直接回家，而是与曾经的对手、现在的朋友东治一起绕道去了城里。最近他们常和其他几个伙伴在游戏厅消磨时光，但不知为何，两人开始更多地交流起个人的心事。所以，当东治向他透露自己对光有好感时，真嗣并不意外。他其实早有察觉，只是出于对这份新建立友谊的珍惜，一直未曾明言。

Toji began to play one of the arcade games Shinji recognized. It was the same one he always played when he was in the mood to have a long discussion. Shinji could feel the topic was going to hover over Valentine's Day and Hikari.  
东治开始玩一款碇真嗣熟悉的街机游戏，这通常预示着他想进行一场深入的交谈。碇真嗣预感话题将围绕情人节和光展开。

"You think she said anything about me yet?" asked Toji who gathered several quarters from his back pocket.  
"你认为她提到我了吗？" Toji 边说边从裤兜里掏出几枚 25 美分硬币。

Shinji couldn't help but feel useless. "I don't know. She never really talks to me."  
真嗣忍不住觉得自己一无是处。“我不清楚，她其实很少和我交流。”

The jock merely sneered, "Oh come on. You can't tell me Asuka never tells you anything?"  
那位运动员只是冷笑一声：“别逗了，你总不会说明日香什么都没跟你透露过吧？”

It was just then Shinji could feel the outline of the concert tickets burning at his back pocket, maybe Toji would be better explaining the scenario to him. He placed his bag beside him and inserted several of his own credits into the machine beside Toji and began to play.  
就在那一刻，真嗣感觉到后裤袋里的音乐会门票轮廓隐隐发烫，或许由东治来向他解释情况更为妥当。他放下背包，在东治旁边的机器里投入了几枚自己的硬币，随即开始游戏。

"Speaking of Asuka, have you noticed she's been… a little… different?" he asked.  
"提到明日香，你注意到她最近是不是有点……不一样了？"他问道。

This didn't seem to perk up anything out of the normal because Toji quickly answered, "Not really. She's been her normal bitchy self, especially this morning. She looked wild." Shinji's mind quickly hovered back to last night. His blood began to heat up.  
这似乎并未引起什么异常，东治很快回应道：“没什么，她还是老样子，脾气暴躁，今早更是如此，看起来很狂躁。” 真嗣的思绪迅速被拉回到昨晚，他的血液开始沸腾。

"What do you mean?" 你指的是什么？

"I tried to avoid her but before I could she grabbed me and asked me what time the student kitchen opens. Dunno what that meant but I told her. She looked more like a mess than usual." No doubt, Shinji thought, she was trying to find someone to help her prepare that lunch she had given him. The thought of Asuka waking up early on his behalf sent a mixed emotion of worry and flattery. Shinji dug into his pocket and took out the tickets Asuka had given him and blindly held it towards Toji who eyed them.  
我本想避开她，可她动作更快，一把抓住我问学生厨房何时开门。虽不明所以，我还是告诉了她。她看起来比往常更加凌乱。真嗣暗想，她定是在寻人帮忙准备那顿赠予他的午餐。想到明日香为他早起，心中涌起忧虑与喜悦交织的情感。真嗣从口袋中摸出明日香给的票，随手递向东治，东治瞟了一眼。

"Dude, I don't float that way," he said bluntly. Shinji's head immediately leaned forward and banged into the game machine's window.  
"伙计，我可不是那样飘的，"他直言不讳。真嗣的头随即猛地前倾，咚的一声撞到了游戏机的屏幕上。

He retorted, "It's not for you. Asuka gave them to me."  
他反驳说：“这不是给你的，是明日香给我的。”

From the corner of his eye Shinji could see the words "Game Over" on Toji's screen. Clearly he said something that stunned him. The jock calmly spun around and leaned on the machine and stared, his face trying to conceal a look of shock and amazement.  
真嗣从眼角瞥见东治的屏幕上闪现着“游戏结束”的字样，显然是他的话让东治愣住了。这位运动健将镇定地转过身，倚在机器上凝视，脸上极力掩饰着内心的震惊与惊叹。

"Let me get this straight," he began, "Are you telling me Asuka, the 'Red-Devil', the one that sits behind you in class and kills with looks alone… gave you these tickets?"  
让我确认一下，"他开口道，"你是说，坐在你后面、光凭眼神就能让人不寒而栗的'红魔'明日香，真的给了你这些票？

Shinji could understand his skepticism but there wasn't any way around it.  
真嗣明白他的疑虑，但这确实无法回避。

"Yeah, she did. Right after she gave me lunch."  
对，她做了。就在给我做完午餐后。

"WHAT?" 什么？

Shinji wished he hadn't said that. The eyes of random arcade goers were hovering towards them. "It's not a big deal. She just made me lunch and gave me these tickets."  
真嗣后悔说了那番话。电玩城里，陌生人的目光纷纷投向他们。“真的没什么，她不过是给我准备了午餐，还送了我这些票。”

Toji quickly snatched the tickets and inspected them. His eyes grew.  
透二迅速抓过票券，仔细审视。他的眼睛不由得瞪大了。

"Do you realize these are for a concert right?"  
你明白这些是音乐会的票吗？

"Yeah, I know." 嗯，我知道。

"Did she give you these to hold onto for the both of you or did she give you them to take someone you want?" The thought hadn't crossed Shinji's mind. Was it for him to keep and take whomever he pleased? Did she intend for him to take her? She didn't say.  
"她把这些交给你，是为了你们共同保管，还是让你带你想带的人？" 真嗣从未考虑过这个问题。这是否意味着他可以自由选择带走任何人，包括她？她并未明言。

"All she said was to show up," he told Toji.  
"她只说了要出现," 他对东二说道。

The jock was now too entranced to play his game anymore, "Well, are you?"  
这位运动员此刻已深陷其中，无法再继续比赛，“那么，你呢？”

Shinji eyed the tickets and thought. He hadn't even contemplated on going. He was so distracted by her behavior he hadn't even decided whether or not he was going to continue following along. He sighed and rested his eyes on his shoes. Why couldn't anything be simple?  
真嗣凝视着票，陷入沉思。他甚至未曾考虑过前往。她的举止令他心神不宁，以至于他尚未决定是否要继续追随。他轻叹一声，目光垂落在自己的鞋上。为何一切不能简单明了？

Shinji returned to the apartment in the early evening, his mind was nothing short of a mess trying to organize its deepest conflicts. He was grateful to learn Asuka wasn't home. This could grant him even more time to think. He made his way into his room where he threw his things onto the ground and flung himself into his cot. Dusk was beckoning and the soft breeze of early night soothed him. It wasn't long until he found himself in a deep sleep.  
傍晚时分，真嗣回到公寓，脑海中思绪纷乱，正努力梳理内心的矛盾。得知明日香尚未归来，他暗自庆幸，这意味着他能有更多时间静思。他步入自己的房间，随手将物品抛掷一旁，随即躺倒在床上。夜幕初降，轻柔的晚风带来慰藉。很快，他便进入了梦乡。

Asuka and Hikari stopped right outside the apartment door. They had been discussing her next code of movement. Asuka being the one who didn't know how to get things the proper way relied heavily on her friend who happily explained. It was an odd thing for Asuka to be given lessons, her pride was already suffering a blow for even asking Hikari to help her but she even knew herself she would chase Shinji away.  
明日香和光在公寓门前驻足，正商讨着她的下一步行动。不擅长处理这类事情的明日香，全靠好友光的热心指导。对于一向骄傲的明日香而言，接受帮助本就让她自尊受损，但她深知，若不求助，只会让真嗣离她而去。

"Don't get yourself so worked up; it's not that difficult," Hikari assured her, "just follow your instinct. You might be bad at getting guys but you're still a girl. You have insight and intuition. Just play it the way you think it's gonna play and I'm sure he'll see it."  
别太紧张，这事儿没那么复杂，"光安慰她道，"相信你的直觉。虽然你不擅长追男生，但作为女孩，你自有洞察和直觉。就按你的感觉来，我相信他能领会。

Asuka hated to be left with instructions, she was never good at following them to the letter the way she knew it was supposed to be. She sighed, how did she even get to this point? The very thought of last night sent a sickening feeling in her stomach. She felt so awkward afterwards and the only reason she had the guts to make that damn lunch and give him those tickets was because of Hikari. If it was up to her she would force Shinji to give her what she wanted, but somehow, that didn't seem to be the right option.  
明日香最烦被留下指令，她向来不擅长一丝不苟地遵循。她叹了口气，自己怎么就陷入了这种境地？昨晚的记忆让她胃里一阵翻腾。事后她感到无比尴尬，若非光的鼓励，她绝不会有勇气做那顿午餐并送出那些票。若按她的性子，她会逼真嗣满足她的要求，但直觉告诉她，这不是明智之举。

"Why do I even care?" she found herself saying.  
"我为何还要在意呢？"她不禁脱口而出。

Hikari didn't recognize the rhetorical question and answered: "Because you like him. I guess it can't be helped. You guys have been living with one another for nearly a year and a half. I guess that counts for something." And with that she left. Asuka sighed heavily and opened the door to the apartment. It was quiet and all the lights were out. No one's home, she thought. She walked into her room and dropped her things which consisted of random bags filled with stationary supplies. Hikari had told her to write letters to express herself considering she had zero ability to do it verbally. She felt like a puppet being strung around. All of this felt weird, she wasn't this girly and even if she was this took it to a whole new level. She lied herself down and stared at the ceiling.  
光并未察觉到这是一个反问句，便回答说：“因为你喜欢他吧。看来也只能这样了。你们同住都快一年半了，总该有些感情。”说完，她便离开了。明日香深深叹了口气，推开公寓的门。屋内一片寂静，灯光全熄。她心想，家里没人。她走进房间，将装满文具的袋子随意放下。光曾建议她通过写信来表达自己，因为她口头表达能力很差。她觉得自己像个被操控的傀儡。这一切都显得异常，她本不是那种娇滴滴的女孩，即便如此，这也太过分了。她躺下，凝视着天花板。

She had liked Shinji for quite a while, although, she did not know it. It took Hikari's masterful question asking skills to weed it out of her and when she finally admitted it the answers stunned her too. When she thought about it, she often found herself giving Shinji excuses to pry his affection. For some reason his opinion mattered the most to her and when he complimented her she could feel her spirits lift. It was an odd feeling but something she couldn't ignore. However, trying to express it had its downsides. She didn't know how and she didn't want to be vulnerable to rejection. She had no choice but to turn to Hikari who instantly bombarded her with suggestions. Nothing so far had been her own idea… besides last night.  
她对真嗣的喜欢已持续许久，自己却未曾察觉。多亏了光那巧妙的提问，她才恍然大悟，连自己都感到意外。细想之下，她常找理由去博取真嗣的好感。不知何故，他的评价对她至关重要，每当他赞扬她，她的心情便随之高涨。这种感觉虽奇异，却难以忽视。但表达这份情感也伴随着风险。她不知如何开口，更害怕面对被拒的脆弱。无奈之下，她求助于光，后者立刻给出了众多建议。至今为止，她还未曾有过自己的主意……除了昨晚。

Her ears perked when she heard snoring. Lifting herself out of bed she could hear the snoring coming from the next room. She was slightly surprised Shinji was fast asleep this whole time. He looked… rather cute like that. She shook her head, she was succumbing to that girly feeling, and she grew to dislike it. It made her vulnerable.  
听到鼾声，她的耳朵立刻竖了起来。从床上坐起，她辨认出鼾声来自隔壁房间。真嗣竟然一直熟睡，这让她略感意外。他那模样……还挺惹人怜爱的。她摇摇头，自己竟被这种少女心绪所困，她对此感到不快。这让她显得不堪一击。

Then he mumbled: "Asuka,"  
接着他含糊地说：“明日香，”

She felt her heart skip a beat. Was he dreaming about her? She couldn't help but slip into the room and sit at the foot of his cot. She was curious to find out if she would hear anything more. She still didn't know if Shinji felt her same feelings. Maybe this would be a good way of finding out.  
她感到心跳漏了一拍，他是否在梦中遇见了她？她情不自禁地溜进房间，坐在他的床尾，好奇是否能听到更多。她仍不确定真嗣是否与她心意相通，或许这正是探知的好机会。

But after several minutes of sitting there quietly, all she got was more snoring.  
然而，静静坐了几分钟之后，她听到的只是更响的鼾声。

She buried her face in her hands. You're more than an idiot, she told herself, you're completely insane. She took a deep breath and continued her gaze on the sleeping Shinji. "You know, it's funny. I thought you were a complete moron the moment I met you."  
她双手捂脸，内心自责：“你何止是傻，简直是疯了。”她深吸一口气，目光再次投向沉睡的碇真嗣。“说来好笑，我一见到你就觉得你是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。”

The room was silent. 房间内鸦雀无声。

She continued: "I thought you were this shy, poor excuse for a pilot, little boy who knew nothing about the Eva's. I never thought I would fall for someone like you."  
她接着说：“起初我以为你不过是个腼腆、不称职的飞行员，对 Eva 一窍不通的小男孩。真没想到我会对你动心。”

Shinji replied with a parade of snoring effects, Asuka felt at ease, the feeling of confessing was addicting and knowing the person she was confessing to couldn't hear her only eased the anxiety she felt.  
真嗣的回应是一连串的鼾声，这让明日香感到安心。坦白的感觉让她着迷，而知道对方听不见自己，更是大大缓解了她的紧张情绪。

"But," she said, "the more I was around you the more I allowed myself to make mistakes. I saw how many you've made and no one really got on your case about them. When I made a mistake it was the same, but, I was the only one who couldn't live it down. Even when I did make a mistake you were there to help. I didn't even have to force you. You were just… there."  
但是，"她坦言，"和你相处越久，我越能接受自己的错误。我目睹了你犯下的许多错误，却无人真正责怪你。当我犯错时，同样无人追究，但我自己却难以释怀。即便如此，你总是在那里伸出援手，无需我恳求，你只是自然而然地在那里。

She stared at the sleeping boy; the crickets began to ease their song into the background.  
她凝视着熟睡的男孩，蟋蟀的鸣叫声渐渐淡入背景之中。

"I had no one to understand me. It's funny; someone like you can understand someone like me. You could do something I thought was impossible for others. You're so dumb that even my biggest mistakes and blunders don't seem to faze you. I can make mistakes around you. I can be human around you, I don't have to pretend. I don't have to put a wall up, because every time I do, you find a way to make me lower it."  
我曾孤立无援，无人能懂。可笑的是，你这样的人竟能理解我。你能做到我以为他人无法企及的事。你如此迟钝，连我最大的过失和疏忽也似乎无法触动你。在你面前，我可以犯错，可以展现真实的人性，无需伪装。我不必竖起心防，因为每次我这么做，你总有办法让我卸下它。

She felt a rush of emotional pain wash over her; never in her life could she admit her faults. It was like admitting to herself she was weak. But sitting here, with the one person who thought otherwise, made her feel empowered. Was this why she had fallen for Shinji?  
她感到一股情感的痛楚袭来；她一生中从未能直面自己的过错。这无异于承认自己的软弱。然而，与那位持相反观点的人并肩而坐，却让她感到力量倍增。难道这就是她对真嗣倾心的原因吗？

The next thing that happened was completely out of instinct. She lied beside Shinji; slipping her legs underneath the sheets with him and sliding her arms under his in a pseudo embrace. She could smell his scent; it wasn't a brutal smell like a whiff from the boy's locker room. His was more gentle and soothing. She nuzzled her nose behind the back of his neck causing him to move slightly in his slumber. She wondered how long she could stay like this before he noticed and awoke. At this point, she didn't care, she enjoyed this, and she didn't want to give it up.  
随后发生的一切全凭本能。她挨着真嗣躺下，双腿滑进被单与他同眠，双臂从他身下穿过，仿佛在拥抱。她嗅到他的气息，不似男生更衣室那般刺鼻，而是温和而抚慰人心。她轻触他的后颈，令他在睡梦中微动。她思索着能这样依偎多久，直到他察觉醒来。此刻，她已不在乎，只想沉浸在这份温馨中，不愿放手。

"I want to be the only one who makes fun of you," she whispered gently, "If anyone is going to call you names it's going to be me."  
我只想成为那个唯一取笑你的人，"她温柔地低语，"若有人要给你起外号，那必须是我。

Did he love her the way she was beginning to love him?  
他是否也像她那样，开始对她产生了爱意？

"I want to tell you everything tomorrow night, when we go. I want you to know from me. I know I'm going to screw it up somehow but knowing you… I think you can understand."  
明晚我们出发时，我想向你坦白一切，希望你能直接从我这里得知。我清楚自己可能会搞砸，但考虑到你的理解力……我相信你能体谅。

That morning Shinji awoke, he stretched and released a mighty yawn and gazed sleepily at the ceiling. He felt strangely happy but he couldn't figure out the root cause of it. He turned in his cot and for some odd reason felt as if something was missing. His head instinctively turned to the side and what he found was interesting.  
那天清晨，真嗣醒来后伸了个懒腰，打了个响亮的哈欠，迷迷糊糊地看着天花板。他感到一种难以言喻的快乐，却无法探究其根源。他在床上翻了个身，莫名觉得有些不对劲。他的头不由自主地转向一侧，发现的事情颇为有趣。

Several strands of red hair.  
几束红发丝。

He blinked. 他眨眼了。

Since when were long strands of red hair commonplace in his room? He shook his head; he suddenly remembered a vivid dream he had had. It had a lot to do with Asuka and he could have sworn she was talking to him but as to what he couldn't decipher. His eyes slowly found their way to a hanging calendar right above his alarm clock.  
他的房间何时开始频繁出现长长的红发？他摇摇头，脑海中突然浮现出一个清晰的梦境。梦中涉及明日香，他确信她在梦中与他交谈，但谈话内容却模糊不清。他的视线慢慢移到了闹钟上方的日历上。

Valentine's Day. 圣瓦伦丁节。

His heart sank and suddenly the thoughts of yesterday filled him with complete dread. He still had no clue what he was going to do. There was no school today so that left him time to think but it didn't give him forever. He pulled himself together and peered out his bedroom. He could hear the television in the living room, someone was there but whom?  
他的心情沉重，昨日的回忆突然袭来，令他感到深深的恐惧。他依旧茫然无措。今天学校放假，虽有时间思考，但并非无休止。他振作精神，从卧室向外张望。客厅里传来电视的声音，显然有人，只是不知是谁。

He didn't make it a goal to find out, he needed to decide. He quickly changed clothes and slipped quietly out of his bedroom. He made it to the front door but once he opened it his heart sank.  
他并非有意去探究，而是必须做出抉择。他迅速更衣，悄无声息地离开了卧室。抵达前门时，他打开了门，却顿时心情沉重。

There stood Asuka, in her hands large grocery bags.  
明日香站在那里，双手提着满满的购物袋。

She stared at him, an expressionless stare on her face.  
她凝视着他，面无表情。

"Good, you can help me unpack this crap. Misato had me make a run since you were too busy getting your beauty sleep," she said. Shinji's head turned slowly to the living room where Misato sat lazily on the couch, a beer clutched in her hand.  
"行，你来帮我整理这些杂物吧。美里看你睡得正香，就让我去跑腿了。"她边说边看向客厅，只见美里慵懒地坐在沙发上，手里还拿着一罐啤酒。

He submitted and without another word helped Asuka with the task. He could feel her eyes on him but he didn't grant her the same respect. He couldn't figure her out. He was more confused about everything. Asuka had a weird way of telling him what she felt and the other night was a perfect example. She kissed him, a kiss he still couldn't shake off but what did it mean? She never relayed any of her true notions in his direction. She had acted completely out of the norm yesterday, something she would never do or at least on purpose. Something felt out of place, was she trying to play a joke on him?  
他提交了文件，随后一言不发地协助明日香完成任务。尽管能感受到她的目光，他却未曾回以同样的关注。他对她捉摸不透，对周遭的一切愈发感到迷茫。明日香表达情感的方式颇为奇特，前夜的吻便是明证，那吻至今仍萦绕心头，但其含义何在？她从未向他透露过内心的真实想法。昨日她的行为一反常态，这绝非她会故意为之。某种不协调感油然而生，难道她在捉弄他？

Once all the groceries were away he headed for the door again but again something forbade him from making his escape.  
杂货整理完毕，他再次朝门口走去，却又一次被某种力量阻止了逃离。

"Where are you going?" asked Asuka. Shinji stood at the doorway unable to answer such a simple question.  
"你要去哪里？"明日香问道。真嗣站在门口，面对这个简单的问题却答不上来。

He stumbled through his response: "Going for a walk."  
他结结巴巴地答道：“去散个步。”

"You remember we have… somewhere to be later on tonight right?" she asked, her voice careful to pick the right words. Shinji felt as if he had been dipped in a vat of sub-zero water. He couldn't find his voice to speak, he couldn't figure out if the invitation was legit or another scheme of hers to get something from him.  
"你记得我们今晚稍后还有个地方要去，对吧？" 她小心翼翼地选择着措辞问道。真嗣感觉自己仿佛被浸入了冰冷的水中，一时失语，无法判断这个邀请是真心还是她另有所图的伎俩。

"I think so," he said, with that he disappeared. Asuka could only stare at the closed apartment door, she felt stung and somewhat apprehensive. She had a feeling she went wrong somewhere.  
"我想是的，"他这样说着，便消失了。明日香望着紧闭的公寓门，心中感到一阵刺痛，还有些许不安。她隐约觉得，自己可能在某个地方做错了什么。

Shinji walked aimlessly through the city not caring where he went and whom he met. He just wanted to figure out what the hell was going on. He found himself sitting on a bench on the outskirts of a park. He watched as couples began to walk idly down the streets seemingly oblivious to everything but their significant other. He wondered how that felt, to be so in tuned with someone so much that nothing outside his vision mattered. He thought back to his mother and father, a relationship he couldn't salvage nor one that made any sense. Maybe that was why he couldn't really find it within himself to find that relationship with Asuka. He always thought she hated him, after so long he learned to accept the way she was and played it as if that was the norm. He never really thought of her as a potential interest but always held her away from the way he thought of others. He liked other girls in class, Hikari being a distant admission to this, but for some reason, Asuka was always an exception. Their relationship was complex, everyone knew that but he knew some of his friends felt it was only a matter of time before things got closer but as to when it was anyone's guess.  
真嗣在城市中漫无目的地游荡，对去向和遇见的人漠不关心。他只想搞清楚究竟发生了什么。不知不觉，他坐在了公园边的一条长椅上。看着情侣们悠然自得地漫步街头，仿佛除了彼此，外界的一切都与他们无关。他不禁好奇，与某人心灵相通到这种程度，外界的一切都变得无足轻重，那会是怎样的感受。他回忆起自己的父母，那段他无力挽回，也难以理解的婚姻。或许这正是他难以在内心深处与明日香建立那种关系的原因。长期以来，他一直认为明日香讨厌他，渐渐地，他接受了她的态度，并视之为常态。 他从未真正将她看作潜在的恋爱对象，总是将她与其他人区别对待。他喜欢班上的其他女生，对 Hikari 的喜欢只是勉强承认，但 Asuka 始终是个例外。他们的关系复杂，众所周知，但他知道有些朋友认为，他们关系更进一步只是时间问题，至于何时，则无人能预料。

From the corner of his eye he saw someone approach him, "You decided you're going yet?"  
他眼角余光瞥见有人靠近，问道："你决定要走了吗？"

Shinji shook his head, "No, I don't know. How do I know that she's not just being nice and wants to use me?"  
真嗣摇头道：“不，我不清楚。我怎么确定她不是出于好意，实际上是想利用我呢？”

Toji sat beside him, his hands buried in his jacket pockets, his head cocked upward and staring at the rustling tree that towered over them. "Don't know what to tell you, it's Asuka. She's not the easiest. I wouldn't go."  
透二坐在他身旁，双手插在夹克口袋中，头微微倾斜，仰望着头顶沙沙作响的大树。“我真不知道该怎么跟你说，是明日香。她可不好应付。我不会去的。”

Shinji shot him a look of curiosity.  
真嗣带着好奇的眼神看了他一眼。

"Why wouldn't you?" 你为什么不呢？

"Think about it, it could all be a trick. You know her more than any of us. She has weird ways and she probably could be using you as rebound."  
仔细想想，这可能都是她的伎俩。你比我们任何人都更了解她，她行事古怪，很可能是在利用你作为过渡。

"Rebound?" 恢复？

"You know, she probably liked some other dude and he turned her down. Knowing her she probably couldn't live with that. She could be just using you so she doesn't feel like she was at a complete loss. That's what guys do all the time," he said. Shinji thought of it, it made some sense. Every time she did something out of the ordinary it could constitute as frustration for not getting what she originally wanted from someone else. He remembered the time she had tricked him into kissing her; holding his nose in order to force him to kiss her open mouthed. Now when he looked back at it she merely used an excuse to get him to do it. What was the excuse the other night?  
"你知道，她可能原本喜欢上了别的男生，结果被拒了。以她的性格，可能受不了这种打击。她可能只是在利用你，让自己不至于彻底失败。男生们常干这种事，"他分析道。真嗣琢磨了一下，觉得有几分道理。每当她做出一些出格的事，或许都是因为没能从别人那里得到她最初想要的东西而感到的挫败。他记得有次她骗他接吻；捏住他的鼻子逼他张嘴吻她。现在想来，她不过是找个借口让他就范。那天晚上她用的借口是什么呢？

_"I'm preparing you for other girls… think of it as you owe me."  
我这是在帮你适应和其他女孩相处，就当是你欠我一个人情吧。_

This wouldn't be the first time she made him do something he wasn't sure of. It was like whenever it suited her she could devise some excuse for her own needs. Something about that made him angry.  
这并非她首次让他做不确定的事。每当她的需求得到满足，她总能巧妙地找到借口。这种行为让他感到愤怒。

Toji noticed his friend standing, his gaze in avoidance: "Shinji?"  
冬二发现朋友站在一旁，眼神回避：“是真嗣吗？”

"You're right; it's probably her just using me like she always does," he said, "Anything you wanna do now?"  
你说得没错，她大概又在利用我了，一贯如此。"他叹道，"接下来你想做点什么？

"Well, I dropped off Hikari's V-Day gift so I have nothing else to do. What do you have in mind?" he asked. Shinji pulled out the tickets Asuka had given him.  
"嗯，我已经把光的情人节礼物送去了，现在没什么事了。你有什么打算？"他问道。真嗣掏出了明日香给他的票。

"Wanna go see a concert?"  
去看音乐会怎么样？

Shinji opened the door to the apartment later that night. He checked the time before he and Toji parted ways. One in the morning, good thing he had his NERV I.D. Curfew was nothing more than a technicality. He walked in, the lights were off, and no doubt Misato had vacated the apartments hours ago. He stepped in and the moment he had done so he was soon flung off his feet. He felt a devastating surge of pain erupt on the side of his face instantly knocking him off balance and tumbling furiously onto the floor. He gasped in pain; he tasted copper between his lips. He tried to see who had punched him but he next thing he knew he felt someone mount him, his assailant's entire weight on his chest and a flurry of punches reigning down on him. He tried his best to deflect most of the blows but to no avail. Then as quickly as they began to unleash on him the punches subsided and then a sudden burst of sobs came. It took Shinji several moments to realize it was a feminine whimper.  
深夜，真嗣打开了公寓的门。与东治分别前，他看了看时间，已是凌晨一点，幸好他有 NERV 的身份证。宵禁对他来说只是个形式。他走进漆黑的屋内，显然美里早已离开。刚一进门，他突然感到脸颊一阵剧痛，整个人被击倒在地，痛苦地喘息着，嘴里满是血腥味。他想看清袭击者，但随即有人骑在他身上，对方的重量压得他喘不过气，拳头如雨点般砸下。 他竭尽全力试图挡开大部分攻击，却徒劳无功。紧接着，那些拳脚突然停下，取而代之的是一阵突发的哭泣声。真嗣过了好一会儿才反应过来，那是女性的抽泣声。

He coughed: "Asuka?" 他咳嗽着问道：“是明日香吗？”

He felt a line of knuckles side swipe his jaw forcing him to grunt in pain. He cupped his mouth and could feel blood pour from his nose. Coughing again he managed to sit up realizing Asuka had released him and retreated. The pain wasn't as bad as it seemed, he learned over the course of a year to take pain so this was relatively weak compared to what he had to endure. However, blood was spilled and he could very well tell it was his fault entirely. He sat up in the darkened hall, blood trickling down his nose using his sleeves as a napkin. He didn't feel angered by the assault, if anything he felt as if he deserved it. He had a feeling Asuka would be mad at him and he was willing to face it but he hadn't expected this much aggression.  
他感到一排指关节猛地侧击下巴，痛得他不由自主地哼了一声。他捂住嘴，血从鼻子里涌出。咳嗽几声后，他勉强坐起身，发现明日香已经松手并退开。疼痛虽剧烈，但与他一年来的忍耐相比，还算轻微。然而，血的流出让他明白，这完全是自找的。他坐在昏暗的走廊里，用袖子擦拭着鼻血。对于这次攻击，他并不感到愤怒，反而觉得这是自己应得的惩罚。他预感到明日香会生气，也做好了面对的准备，只是没料到她的反应会如此激烈。

He walked into the bathroom and began to wipe the blood from his face. He looked in the mirror and noticed the shower curtain was trembling. Then a series of forceful suppressed whimpers followed.  
他步入浴室，着手擦拭脸上的血迹。透过镜子，他察觉到浴帘微微颤动。紧接着，一阵阵被压抑的呜咽声接连响起。

I'm so fucked up, he thought.  
他心想，自己真是糟透了。

He sat at the lip of the bathtub, he could tell she was using every ounce of her strength to silence herself but the devastation she felt clearly trumped her emotions. It was gut wrenching to find out this way that she was being completely legit. Did this mean she really did have honest feelings for him? Something about that felt strangely odd but also felt welcoming.  
他坐在浴缸边缘，察觉到她正倾尽全力抑制自己，然而内心的崩溃显然压倒了她的情绪。以这种方式发现她的真诚，令人心碎。这是否表明她真的对他抱有真挚的情感？这种感觉既显得奇怪，又让人感到温暖。

"Asuka… I…" Asuka…我…

Her voice was hoarse and completely laced with poison: "Don't fucking talk to me."  
她的嗓音沙哑，满含恶意：“别来烦我。”

He took in a breath, repairing what he had done was going to be a journey in on itself.  
他深吸一口气，意识到要修复自己的过失，本身就是一段旅程。

"I had no idea this meant that much to you," he said desperately.  
"真没想到，这对你意义如此重大，"他绝望地说道。

Suddenly he heard her fist strike the side of the tub, the sound of tiny porcelain shards hitting the bottom of the bathtub echoed.  
忽然间，他听见她用拳头猛击浴缸侧壁，细碎的瓷片落入浴缸底部，发出阵阵回响。

"I don't fucking care," she whimpered, "Just get out and shut the door!"  
我真不在乎了，"她哽咽道，"走吧，把门带上！

He stood feeling the pang of defeat sweep him, he was about to exit the bathroom when suddenly his instincts took over.  
他站在原地，被失败的痛楚所淹没，正准备离开浴室之际，本能突然占据了主导。

He said: "Why didn't you tell me directly?"  
他问道：“你为何不直接跟我说呢？”

She seemed to submit, her emotions getting the better of her, "Because I didn't want to be turned down by an idiot like you!"  
她似乎屈服于情绪，脱口而出：“因为我不想被你这种蠢货拒绝！”

"Why do you confuse me? One moment we are kissing and the next your calling me names!" he said feeling the pressure of anger rise.  
"你为何让我如此困惑？刚才还亲吻着，转眼间你却开始辱骂我！" 他感受到愤怒的情绪逐渐高涨。

Suddenly Asuka tore the shower curtain away, her eyes red and her cheeks drenched: "Because I'm lost!"  
突然间，明日香一把扯开浴帘，双眼泛红，脸颊挂满水珠：“因为我迷失了方向！”

"What?" 什么？

"You think this is fucking easy for me?! You think my life has been easy?! I lost everything, I don't even know what real love is, and I don't know how to express it! Is it so hard to imagine I might have a thing for you?" she bellowed. Shinji just stood there, stunned. He hadn't thought of it that way, "None of this was my plan. Hikari helped me do all of it, I listened to her, look where the hell that got me."  
你以为这对我来说轻而易举吗？！你以为我的生活一帆风顺吗？！我失去了一切，我甚至不懂真正的爱是什么，更不知道如何表达！想象我可能对你有感觉，真的那么难吗？" 她怒吼着。真嗣愣在原地，震惊不已。他从没从这个角度想过，"这一切都不是我预设的。是光在帮我，我听从了她，结果却落得如此境地。

Misato stared and nodded slowly. She took the story in but made no effort to state her thoughts. Asuka was staring at the television unknowingly allowing her tears to fall. She had already had her pride trampled on; there was nothing else to hide. Misato got to her feet.  
三笠凝视着，慢慢地点了点头。她虽然听进去了故事，却没有表达自己的想法。明日香无意识地盯着电视，任由泪水流淌。她的自尊心已被践踏，再也没有什么需要隐藏的了。三笠站了起来。

"Shinji, come out now," she said. Asuka's ears perked and she immediately shot her guardian a look of betrayal. Shinji walked out from the hall, his head hung low and his eyes avoiding hers. He had heard a large portion of her side of the tale.  
"真嗣，快出来吧，" 她催促着。听到这话，明日香立刻警觉起来，随即向她的监护人投去怀疑的目光。真嗣从走廊里缓缓走出，低垂着头，眼神躲闪，不敢直视她。他已经听到了她讲述的大部分故事。

"He told me a lot of what happened last night, I just wanted to hear yours," and with that she went to another room.  
"他向我讲述了昨晚发生的许多事情，我更想听听你的版本。" 说完，她便走向了另一个房间。

It was just the two of them now.  
此刻，只剩下他们俩。

"How long have you been listening?" she asked him, she did not dare steal a glance.  
"你已经听了多久了？"她向他问道，却不敢偷瞄一眼。

He responded: "Not long."  
他回应道：“不会太久。”

"Liar," 说谎者，

"Can you blame me?" 你难道能怪我吗？

"No."

"I'm sorry for last night, I really am," he said.  
"对于昨晚的事，我真的很抱歉，"他说。

She nodded, "I don't care. It wasn't my idea anyway."  
她点头说：“我无所谓，本来就不是我的主意。”

"I figured as much," 我早该想到的

"Remember when I asked you if I was a bitch?"  
还记得我问过你我是不是很刻薄吗？

"Yeah?" 真的吗？

"I really didn't care what others thought of me. I only asked you that because I wanted to know what you really thought. I wanted to know what you thought of me."  
我并不在意他人的看法，之所以问你，是希望了解你内心的真实想法。我想知道你对我有何看法。

"I don't think you're as bad as others think,"  
我觉得你并不像别人所说的那么糟糕，

"I can be a bitch sometimes and I'm alright with that,"  
我偶尔会显得刻薄，但我对此并不介怀，

Shinji couldn't help but smile.  
真嗣情不自禁地露出了笑容。

"I'm glad you can be so neutral about it."  
你能对此保持中立，我很欣慰。

"What else can I do?"  
我还可以做些什么呢？

"You think this can work?"  
你觉得这办法行得通吗？

Asuka stared, words seemingly lost in her throat.  
明日香目不转睛地盯着，似乎说不出话来。

"If you don't treat me right I'm going to kick your ass," she said a faint smile on her lips.  
"你要是对我不好，我可要收拾你了，"她嘴角挂着一抹浅笑说道。

Shinji thought for a moment.  
真嗣沉思了片刻。

"I guess I can take my chances,"  
我想我可以试试运气，

The silence made his stomach hurt, it was bad enough he had to worry about the electricity going out at any moment but the silence made him feel as if someone was waiting for him to make the first sound. He didn't comply; he maintained himself and stared at the hovering fluorescent lights. Maybe it wasn't the silence that was getting to him, maybe it was Asuka. He stood up and walked over to the double barred doors and pressed his ear against it waiting to hear the sound he had been waiting for.  
四周的寂静让他的胃隐隐作痛，他本就担心随时可能停电，而这份寂静更让他感觉似乎有人在等着他打破沉默。他没有屈服，保持镇定，凝视着悬浮的荧光灯。或许让他心烦意乱的并非寂静本身，而是明日香。他站起身，走向双层栅栏门，将耳朵紧贴门板，期待着那个久候的声音。

_Click…click…  咔哒…咔哒…_

Shinji quickly unbuckled the doors and with all his might pulled the massive slabs of metal open just enough to let his companion in. He watched as a red-headed girl toppled inward, bags of random materials scattering as they hit the floor and her breath stuttering and forcing air within her lungs. That was Shinji's cue to shut the doors.  
真嗣迅速解开门扣，竭尽全力拉开沉重的金属门，勉强让同伴挤进来。他目睹一位红发少女踉跄而入，携带的材料袋随之散落，她的呼吸急促，急切地吸入空气。这时，真嗣便合上了门。

"Turn… off… the… lights," she panted. Shinji obeyed the command and darted for the generator which supplied their electricity and shut it down. They were both plunged into darkness.  
"把…灯…关掉，"她气喘吁吁地说。真嗣立刻执行命令，奔向供电的发电机并将其切断。四周顿时一片漆黑。

He whispered: "Asuka, did they follow you?"  
他轻声问道：“明日香，他们有没有跟踪你？”

Suddenly the sound of feet hitting metal could be heard overhead forcing both teens to look upward in fear. The sounds became louder and louder, animalistic growls soon trickled in sending chills down Asuka's spine. She stayed on all fours in fear any drastic movement would warrant an all out swarm.  
突然，头顶响起脚步撞击金属的声音，两个少年惊恐地抬头。声音愈发响亮，夹杂着野兽般的低吼，令飞鸟脊背发凉。她趴伏在地，不敢动弹，唯恐任何大动作会招致蜂拥的攻击。

Then the sounds trailed off, fading into the night. Shinji could make out Asuka's silhouette which gestured to him to repower the warehouse. A low hum emitted from the generator showering the warehouse in a dimmed but pure white light. The two of them stared at one another both hesitating to make a move. When they both deemed the coast was clear Asuka jumped to her feet and tackled the boy sending him hard onto the floor.  
声音渐渐消散于夜幕之中。真嗣辨认出明日香的剪影，她示意他重启仓库电源。发电机低沉作响，仓库内弥漫着微弱却明亮的白光。两人相视无言，都迟疑着未敢轻举妄动。确认安全后，明日香猛然起身，将真嗣扑倒在地。

He couldn't help but say: "What the hell is that for?"  
他不禁问道：“这究竟是做什么用的？”

She didn't answer him; she clutched his dingy shirt and buried her face within his chest.  
她没有回应他，而是紧紧抓住他那件脏旧的衬衫，将脸深深埋入他的怀中。

He didn't realize that she was crying.  
他没察觉到她在哭泣。

"Don't…" she began, her words fragmented because of her sobs, "send… me out there… again."  
别…" 她哽咽着开口，话语因哭泣而支离破碎，"再让我… 出去… 了。

Shinji knew it was getting worst and that Asuka had seen something she shouldn't have. Those creatures were getting closer to their home every day. Now they retained both their scents and were pinpointing their location. He swallowed. Surviving was becoming worse than death.  
真嗣深知事态正日益恶化，明日香无意中目睹了不该看到的景象。那些怪物日复一日地逼近他们的避难所。如今，它们不仅能记住气味，更在精准定位他们的所在。他艰难地咽下一口唾沫，心中明白，生存的艰辛已远超死亡的恐惧。
