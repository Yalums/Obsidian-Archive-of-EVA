_**Let the rain fall, 任凭雨水洒落，**_

_**I don't care, 我无所谓，**_

_**Love burns brighter than sunshine…  
爱情比阳光还要炽热…**_

He was staring at the sun.  
他凝视着太阳。

He was letting its rays caress his face, soak him with warmth, as he stared, unblinkingly.  
他任由阳光轻抚脸颊，温暖渗透全身，目光坚定，未曾眨眼。

The way it was shining, you'd think it was just any normal day.  
它闪闪发光的样子，让人误以为这只是平凡的一天。

His Eva had been shattered; fragments of metal covering the threadbare dirt, wires continuously sparking and twitching, catching fire.  
他的 Eva 机体已支离破碎，金属残片散落在磨损的土地上，电线不断闪烁、抽搐，最终引燃了火苗。

_Eva…Asuka… 伊娃……明日香……_

_Asuka! 明日香！_

He had no strength left to spare. _But I've got to find Asuka!_  
他已经筋疲力尽，但我必须找到明日香！

_Oh god. 哎呀，我的天。_

He could just imagine her broken body, entangled and encased within that giant, twisted scrap of metal.  
他只能想象她那破碎的身体，被缠绕并困在那个巨大扭曲的金属残骸中。

_I HATE EVA! I HATE EVERYONE! EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING!  
我恨 EVA！我恨每一个人！所有人和一切事物！_

No. No. He couldn't afford to think that way. He had to find her. He just had to!  
不，不。他不能那样想。他必须找到她。他非找到她不可！

_Twisted and broken, covered in blood…  
扭曲断裂，浑身是血……_

He screamed and gripped his head in his hands.  
他尖叫起来，双手紧紧抱住头部。

"NO!" 不行！

His eyes widened in fear.  
他因恐惧而瞪大了眼睛。

_Imustn'trunawayImustn'trunawayImustn'trunawayImustn'trunaway…  
我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能逃跑…_

And he wouldn't. 他不会这么做。

A rush of adrenaline provided the bit of strength which he used to push himself up.  
肾上腺素的一阵涌动赋予了他所需的那一点力量，让他能够撑起身来。

He hugged her body close to him, cradling her in his arms. She was his only symbol of hope; his reason to push forward.  
他紧紧拥抱着她，将她揽入怀中。她是他唯一的希望象征，也是他勇往直前的动力。

He brushed an auburn lock out of her face and smiled.  
他轻轻拂去她脸上的赤褐色发丝，露出了微笑。

He knew everything was over, that everyone and everything was gone.  
他明白一切都已终结，所有人所有事都已不复存在。

But he needed to focus on himself. And her too.  
但他必须集中精力在自己身上，同时也包括她。

"We're going to make it, Asuka. I promise." He softly kissed her forehead. "Because we have each other."  
我们会成功的，明日香。我保证。" 他温柔地吻了吻她的额头，"因为我们有彼此的支持。

And he knew it was cliché, and he realized how cheesy it has sounded once he'd said it, but it truly was what he believed. Now more than ever.  
他明白这很老套，也察觉到说出口后听起来有多俗气，但这确实是他的真实信念。如今比任何时候都更加坚定。

…_and it's brighter than sunshine…_  
…它比阳光还要灿烂…

[theWanderingANBU](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1075568/theWanderingANBU): 
I need to look at your other stories but this was a good chapter for Never Let You Go. Maybe you should do this (this is purely a suggestion)
我需要看看你的其他故事，但这一章对《永不放手》来说很不错。也许你应该这样做（这纯属建议）

1) combine it with "Never Let You Go" and then expand the story. you have a good story and I think that you could put more to this. It sounds interesting and it keeps you hooked.将它与 “决不让你走 ”结合起来，然后扩展故事。你有一个很好的故事，我认为你可以在其中加入更多内容。这听起来很有趣，让人欲罢不能。

Good job, just a bit short, but I like it! Good job
写得很好，只是有点短，但我喜欢！干得好
