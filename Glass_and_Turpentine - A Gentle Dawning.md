A cute little fluffy one shot revolving around the lives of Asuka and Shinji after the Third Impact.  
围绕第三次冲击后明日香和真嗣的生活展开的一篇可爱小短篇。

---
The sunlight crashing through the window caused her red hair to glow softly, and the pale flesh of her neck and arms to seem ethre He smiled at his sleeping wife, reaching over to brush a few strands of her honey/red hair from her gentle face.  
阳光穿透窗户，使她的红发柔和地闪耀，颈项与手臂的苍白肌肤显得更加细腻。他对着熟睡的妻子微笑，伸手轻轻拂去她温柔脸庞上的几缕蜜色/红色发丝。

It was then that he took a few moments to reflect upon how he had gotten to this place with her.  
就在那时，他花了几分钟时间反思自己是如何与她走到这一步的。

Flash back 回忆闪现

"Where are you going?" he heard himself ask the back of a packing redhead.  
“你要去哪儿？”他听到自己对着一个正在打包的红发背影问道。

"What does it matter?" she answered, tone unusually stiff.  
“这有什么关系？”她回答，语气异常生硬。

He leaned against the door frame, and gazed half impassively into her emptying room.  
他靠在门框上，半无表情地凝视着她空荡荡的房间。

"When will you be back?" he inquired, trying to remain calm, as he watched the girl slip a dress into a dress bag, and fold it, neatly placing it into her suit case.  
“你什么时候回来？”他问道，努力保持平静，看着女孩将一件连衣裙滑入衣物袋中，然后整齐地折叠好，放入她的行李箱。

".. I wont be back Ikari, I'm going back to Germany" she stated, finally looking to him.  
“……我不会回来了，碇，我要回德国。”她终于看向他，说道。

Her azure eyes held a mixture of emotion, the one she tried to portray the most being: stoicism.  
她那蔚蓝的眼眸中蕴含着复杂的情感，其中最想表现的是：坚忍。

"Oh... To see your family?" he inquired, trying to keep a polite and conversational edge to his voice, it faltered a bit.  
"哦... 去看望你的家人吗？" 他询问道，努力保持礼貌且交谈式的语气，但声音略显颤抖。

"No... Just to.. Be there I suppose" she answered, tone non-chalant. She turned back to her packing. "... Dont take it so hard, you knew I'd be going eventually anyhow" she added.  
"不... 只是... 在那里，我想。" 她回答，语气淡然。她转回继续收拾行李。"... 别太在意，你知道我迟早会走的。" 她补充道。

"Does Misato know?" he asked, taking a step into the room.  
"美里知道吗？" 他问，迈步走进房间。

"Yeah, I told her last night" she admitted.  
“是的，我昨晚告诉她了。”她承认道。

"What did she say?" he continued, stopping to stand beside her at the bed.  
“她怎么说？”他继续问道，停下来站在她床边。

"What does it matter, I'm 18 now, I can do whatever the hell I want" she noted in a dead pan voice, brushing a loose strand of hair from her face.  
“这有什么关系，我现在 18 岁了，想干什么就干什么。”她用平淡的语气说道，顺手将一缕散落的头发拂到脸旁。

"What will you do in Germany?" he asked, just wanting to keep conversation with his former piloting partner.  
"你去德国打算做什么？" 他问道，只是想与曾经的飞行搭档保持对话。

She shrugged again. "... Make a carrer... I dont really know. I just have to get out of this place" she mused.  
她又耸了耸肩。"... 开创事业... 我也不太清楚。我只是必须离开这个地方" 她沉思道。

He felt his brow furrow "Why is that?" he asked.  
他感到眉头紧皱 "为什么呢？" 他问道。

She snorted. " Isn't it obvious? There is no place for me here... Nobody cares about the Second Child, its all about the Invincible First and Third Child... I tanked, and there's nothing I can do to repair my reputation" she said smoothly, hand guestures eloquant.  
她哼了一声。“这不是很明显吗？这里没有我的位置...没人关心二号机驾驶员，一切都围绕着无敌的一号机和三号机...我承受了这一切，却无法挽回我的声誉。”她流畅地说着，手势优雅。

_Somehow she didnt sound quite so bothered about it... Just tired.  
不知为何，她听起来并不那么在意...只是感到疲惫。_

"Thats not true, people still talk about you" he offered. She smiled.  
“那不是真的，人们仍然谈论你。”他提议道。她笑了。

"Yes... They talk about the mind rape all the time. They talk about the quarentine.." she corrected, closing the suitcase and buckling it shut.  
"是的...他们总是谈论精神强奸。他们谈论隔离..."她纠正道，合上手提箱并扣紧。

"Asuka..." he sighed. "明日香..."他叹息道。

"What? I cant stand being somewhere where everyone thinks I'm some loon. I couldn't even pilot the Eva Shinji... So.. I just want to go somewhere far from here, where I can disapear" she admitted, looking very tired.  
"怎么了？我无法忍受待在一个每个人都认为我是疯子的地方。我甚至无法驾驶 Eva，真嗣...所以..我只想去一个远离这里的地方，在那里我可以消失"她承认道，看起来非常疲惫。

"... Do you need a ride to the airport?"  
"... 你需要搭车去机场吗？"

"... Sure" she answered. "... 当然" 她回答道。"

_And a ride to the airport was what he gave her.  
而他确实载她去了机场。_

Now.. In fairytale stories, he would've stopped her there, right before she boarded the plane, and confessed that he was head over heels in love with her. She would've gotten teary eyed, and admitted that she felt the same. And... She would've stayed.  
在童话故事里，他本该在她登机前那一刻拦下她，坦白自己已深陷爱河。她会眼眶湿润，承认她也同样心动。然后...她会选择留下。

That wasnt how it happened between them.  
但他们之间并非如此。

"So..." she said, looking from him to the entry port.  
“所以...”她开口道，目光从他转向登机口。

"... So?" he replied. "... 所以呢？" 他回答道。

"... I should get going" she admitted, looking down to her wrist watch.  
"... 我该走了" 她承认道，低头看向手腕上的手表。

_'Don't go' '别走'_

"Yeah.. I guess you should" he answered, feigning a weak smile.  
“嗯……我想你应该这样。”他回答道，假装露出一个虚弱的微笑。

She gave a sunny smile in return, and embraced him. "I'll miss you Baka" she chuckled.  
她回以一个灿烂的微笑，拥抱了他。“我会想你的，笨蛋。”她轻笑道。

".. I'll miss you too Red Devil" he answered, holding her a little longer than comfortable.  
“……我也会想你的，红魔。”他回答，抱着她的时间比平时稍长了一些。

Detaching herself from him she looked back towards the entry port "My flights about to leave" she annonced.  
她从他身边抽身，回头望向入口处，“我的航班就要起飞了。”她宣布道。

_'Dont go' “别走。”_

"Yeah... uh.. I'll write you" he promised. She smiled.  
“是啊...呃...我会给你写信的。”他承诺道。她微笑了。

"Sure, well... I'll wait for your first letter" she said, turning away.  
"当然，嗯... 我会等你第一封信的" 她转过身说道。

_'Dont leave me' '别离开我'_

"A-Asuka?" he heard himself say.  
"明日香？" 他听到自己说道。

_There was a glimmer in her blue eyes, as she turned back to him.  
她的蓝眼睛里闪烁着一丝光芒，当她转回身面对他时。_

"Yeah?" she asked. “嗯？”她问道。

_'Tell her..'_ he prodded himself.  
‘告诉她...’他在心里催促自己。

"I... Umm.. Uh.. I.." he began.  
"我...呃...嗯...我..." 他开始说道。

_The glow in her eyes was growing.  
她眼中的光芒正在增强。_

_'Give her a reason to stay Ikari'  
'给她一个留下来的理由，碇'_

"Yes Shinji?" she inquired, hands twisting in front of her.  
“什么事，真嗣？”她问道，双手在前方扭动着。

_'Tell her how you feel.. Make her stay'_ his inner self suggested.  
‘告诉她你的感受..让她留下’他的内心这样建议道。

"...I need your adress" he answered lamely.  
“...我需要你的地址”他尴尬地回答。

_The hope in her eyes died.  
她眼中的希望破灭了。_

"Sure.." she answered, pulling out a pen, she haphazardly scrawled it across a napkin and handed it to him.  
“当然……”她回答着，抽出一支笔，在餐巾纸上潦草地写下，然后递给了他。

_'You idiot...'_ his inner self scorned.  
“你这个白痴……”他内心嘲讽道。

"Ja!" Asuka called to him, disapearing from sight amoungst the other flight goers.  
“是！”明日香朝他喊道，随即消失在其他旅客之中。

"Dont go..." he said helplessly.  
“别走……”他无助地说。

_But it was too late.. she was out of hearing range.  
但为时已晚……她已经超出了听力范围。_

_End Flash Back 结束闪回_

In all truth, they hadn't seen eachother for many years after that. In fact, it had took the death of their prior guardian to coax Asuka Himmelsbote (her new last name, after becoming a very famous actress, and dumping the last name Soryu) to her old recluse in Japan.  
实际上，自那以后他们多年未见。直到他们之前的监护人去世，才促使明日香·赫尔蒙斯博特（她成名后抛弃了惣流这个姓氏，改用了新姓氏）回到了日本的老宅。

When he had seen her again, he had hardly recognized the now twenty three year old actress. Sure, she was still red headed and blue eyed... The changes were... Amazing.  
当他再次见到她时，几乎认不出这位已经二十三岁的女演员了。当然，她依旧是红发蓝眼……但变化之大，令人惊叹。

Flash back 闪回

"Shinji?" she inquired, wide eyed, looking him up and down. "Asuka? Is that really you?" he chuckled in return. She smiled, and twirled around for him to examine her new self.  
"真嗣？" 她睁大眼睛，上下打量着他。"明日香？真的是你吗？" 他笑着回应。她微笑着，转了一圈让他欣赏她的新模样。

"I heard youre a doctor now" she said conversationally. He nodded.  
"我听说你现在是个医生了" 她随意地说道。他点点头。

"And you, I've seen you prancing all over the silver screen" he answered. She shrugged with a wide grin.  
"而你，我见过你在银幕上四处跳跃" 他回答道。她耸了耸肩，露出了灿烂的笑容。

At the same time they both blurted "How have you been?".  
与此同时，他们俩同时脱口而出："最近怎么样？"

"Good, a little.. Tired. But good" she admitted, shifting in the long straight style black dress she wore. The wind blew her short red treses to her softly angled jaw, she reached back to clip her bangs up to the rest of her spiral curls.  
"挺好的，有点...累。但还不错" 她承认道，在身上那件长而直的黑裙中调整了一下姿势。风吹乱了她短短的红发，拂过她柔和的角度分明的下巴，她伸手将刘海别到脑后，与其他的螺旋卷发束在一起。

"Same here, you couldn't imagine how many teenagers are getting pregnant these days" he chuckled.She smiled softly and looked over to the coffin, a look of sorrow shadowing her blue eyes.  
"我这儿也一样，你想象不到现在有多少青少年怀孕。" 他轻声笑道。她温柔地微笑着，目光转向棺材，悲伤的神情在她的蓝眼睛中若隐若现。

" I heard that you..." she began.  
"我听说你..." 她开口道。

He nodded. "She died.. in the emergency room" he confirmed, his voice cracking a bit.  
他点点头。"她在急诊室去世了。" 他确认道，声音有些哽咽。

"Was it from.." she began.  
"是从……" 她开口道。

He nodded once more."Cirosis of the Liver..." he replied. (So kiddies, this is why you dont drink).  
他再次点了点头。"肝癌……" 他回答。（所以孩子们，这就是为什么你们不要酗酒。）

"I just never thought she would die... I always expected her to be there when I came back" Asuka admitted, tears straying from her eyes to trail the gentle slopes of her cheeks.  
"我从没想过她会去世……我一直以为我回来时她还会在那里" 明日香坦白道，泪水从她的眼中滑落，沿着她柔和的脸颊曲线流淌。

"Me too, Asuka, me too" he sighed.  
"我也是，明日香，我也是" 他叹息道。

_After the funeral, he had gathered up his courage to ask her to dinner. She agreed with a soft smile, and a knowing look in her eyes.  
葬礼结束后，他鼓起勇气邀请她共进晚餐。她温柔地微笑着答应了，眼中闪烁着理解的光芒。_

_And they had reviewed their lives over wine...  
他们一边品酒，一边回顾各自的人生..._

Perhaps too much wine... 或许酒喝得有点多……

"And it was so humiliating!" She laughed, eyes bleary, staggering down the pavement, arm hooked within his.  
“那真是太丢脸了！”她笑着说，眼神迷离，摇摇晃晃地走在人行道上，手臂勾着他的。

"What did you do?" he asked, feeling unusually attentive to the red head beside him.  
“你做了什么？”他问道，对身旁的红发女孩异常关注。

She gave a wide grin, and tossed her head back, a chuckle in the confines of her throat." I took the fur coat, and shredded it right before his eyes. "Take this to your weekend Mistress... And get out of my house!" I told him... And he did go. Now, I'm here" she confirmed, eyes shining.  
她咧嘴一笑，头向后一仰，喉咙里发出低沉的笑声。"我拿起那件毛皮大衣，当着他的面撕成了碎片。"把这个拿去给你周末的情妇吧……然后滚出我的房子！"我告诉他……他真的走了。现在，我在这里"她确认道，眼中闪烁着光芒。

"He was cheating on you?" Shinji inquired, awestruck. _Why would anyone cheat on someone as beautiful as Asuka?_ She nodded somberly. "Why would he do something like that? I mean, the reporters described your relationship as being 'fated'..." he continued, confused.  
“他在欺骗你吗？”真嗣惊讶地问道。为什么有人会背叛像明日香这样美丽的人？她沉重地点了点头。“他为什么要做那样的事？我是说，记者们形容你们的关系是‘命中注定’的……”他继续困惑地说道。

She sighed, and smiled softly ".. What happens behind closed doors.. Ikari-Kun.. Is often much different than what the media speaks.. Benjamin... He was... He was Benjamin. Nothing more, nothing less. It was good for a while, but we were never... Close. If you know what I mean" she answered, hands guesturing gracefully about.  
她叹了口气，温柔地笑了笑“……关起门来的事……一辉君……往往与媒体所说的截然不同……本杰明……他就是……他就是本杰明。不多不少。一开始还不错，但我们从未……亲近。如果你明白我的意思”她回答道，双手优雅地比划着。

" It just doesnt make sense" he admitted slowly, stopping beneath a sakura. She stopped with him, and cocked her head to the side.  
"这根本说不通" 他缓缓承认，停在一棵樱花树下。她与他一同停下，歪着头看向他。

"What doesnt make sense? Its human nature. I wasnt expecting it to last much longer anyhow, no chips off my shoulder. The silver screen has a way of corupting relationships, driving one mate against the other for more publicity..." she explained non chalantly.  
"什么说不通？这是人之常情。我本来也没指望它能持续多久，没什么好抱怨的。银幕有种腐蚀关系的力量，为了更多曝光，总有一方会与另一方对立……" 她漫不经心地解释道。

_Petals falling... gracefully... He would always remember the scent of the blossoms, the scent of Asuka, the twinkle in her blue eyes, and the secret smile playing in the corners of her lips.  
花瓣飘落……优雅地……他总会记得那花儿的香气，明日香的气息，她蓝色眼眸中的闪光，以及她唇角隐秘的微笑。_

"I missed the Sakura Shin-Kun.. " she began, voice slightly distant, as her gaze lowered from the tree to his eyes. "... I missed you" she said simply.  
"我怀念樱花神君..." 她开口道，声音略显遥远，目光从树梢移至他的双眼。"...我想你了" 她简单地说道。

_Falling blossoms, the vannila scent that never left her hair, the deep blue of her eyes, the pink of her lips... Wine and...  
飘落的花瓣，她发间挥之不去的香草气息，她深邃的蓝眼睛，她粉嫩的唇...酒与..._

Morning light hit his eyes, and he groaned, the reverberations of a hangover ringing in his head.Glancing at the clock to his left, he blinked a few times.  
晨光刺入他的眼帘，他呻吟着，宿醉的余波在脑海中回荡。瞥了一眼左边的时钟，他眨了几下眼。

It read ten thirty four. He was late for work.As he went to sit up, he found that he could not. Something heavy was settled over his chest, and it kept him from rising to shower and dress.  
时钟显示十点三十四分。他上班迟到了。当他试图坐起身时，却发现动弹不得。有样沉重的东西压在他的胸口，让他无法起身去洗澡更衣。

_Something scented of vanilla, something with curled red hair... Someone wearing his dress shirt from last night as a coverup to her bare form.  
那东西散发着香草的气息，有着卷曲的红发……一个穿着他昨晚的衬衫作为遮掩的女子，掩盖着她赤裸的身躯。_

She yawned, moaned slightly, and moved against him, arm drapped langourously over his chest, face burrowed into his neck. "... Five minutes..." she made out in a sleepy tone.  
她打了个哈欠，轻声呻吟，挪动身体贴近他，手臂慵懒地搭在他的胸前，脸埋进他的脖颈。“……再睡五分钟……”她用困倦的语气含糊地说道。

_'Oh Dear Lord... I slept with Asuka!"_ was the first thing that popped through his head.  
“哦，天哪...我和明日香睡了！”这是他脑海中首先蹦出的念头。

The second thing being... That he really had to pee!  
第二个念头则是...他真的得去上厕所了！

Gently setting her on the bed, he rushed to the bathroom to allieviate his bowels. When he returned, she was nowhere in sight. Treking through his apartment, he went in seach of the german actress.  
他轻轻地将她放在床上，然后冲向浴室解决内急。当他回来时，她已不见踪影。他穿过自己的公寓，四处寻找那位德国女演员。

When he found her, she was cooking some sort of food on his stove.  
当他找到她时，她正在他的炉子上煮着某种食物。

"Morning" she said cheerfully, looking quite adorable in his overly large -on her- shirt. Her hair was torseled, and her complection was rosy.He scratched the back of his neck, and returned the smile.  
“早上好。”她欢快地说道，穿着他那件对她来说过大的衬衫，显得十分可爱。她的头发凌乱，面颊红润。他挠了挠后颈，回以微笑。

"Asuka.. about last" he began. She smiled, and spooned some scrambled eggs onto a large plate, turned off the burner, and headed towards him.  
“明日香……关于昨晚……”他开口道。她微笑着，舀了一些炒蛋到大盘子里，关掉炉火，朝他走去。

"No worries" she stated, setting the food on the table. " And dont you dare get the notion in your head that you somehow took advantage of me in my anibriated state Ikari" she followed.  
"别担心" 她一边说，一边把食物放在桌上。"你可别以为在我醉酒状态下占了我的便宜，碇" 她接着说。

"But Asuka.. How can you say something like that, women have a lower alchohol tollerence than men do.. I took advantage of you..." he began.  
"但是，明日香……你怎么能这么说，女性的酒精耐受力本来就比男性低……是我占了你的便宜……" 他开始说道。

She gave a wicked grin, and stood before him.Leaning in, her lips brushed against his earlobe. "... I may have been a little chatty, but... I wasnt drunk" she answered.  
她露出了一个狡黠的微笑，站在他面前。她倾身向前，嘴唇轻轻拂过他的耳垂。"……我可能有点多话，但……我并没有醉" 她回答道。

He stumbled back in shock, feeling the solid wall behind him, as she moved in to close the space.Then he found himself in a firm kiss with the actress, not knowing exactly how to approach the situation. Just as he reached to pull her closer, she stepped away with a mirthful smile on her lips.  
他震惊地踉跄后退，感觉到身后坚实的墙壁，而她则上前一步，缩短了两人之间的距离。随后，他发现自己与女演员紧紧相吻，不知该如何应对这一局面。正当他伸手想要将她拉近时，她却带着一抹戏谑的微笑退开了。

"Eat your breakfast.. Its getting cold" she said in a mocking motherly tone.  
“吃你的早餐吧……都快凉了。”她用一种模仿母亲般的语气打趣道。

End Flash back 闪回结束

_And after that, they had began to date eachother. Things were good. They weren't perfect.. But they were good.  
自那以后，他们开始交往。一切都很顺利。虽然并不完美，但确实很好。_

She roused in the bed beside him, blue eyes opening, to blink away at the morning brightness. ".. Morning... Hon" she yawned, reaching up to stroke his face with her impossibly soft hands. She breathed a breath of relief as he leaned down to kiss her lips.  
她在他的身旁醒来，蓝眼睛睁开，眨着适应早晨的明亮。“……早上好……亲爱的。”她打着哈欠，伸手用她那不可思议的柔软双手轻抚他的脸颊。当他俯身亲吻她的唇时，她松了一口气。

" Morning" he answered, with a wide, and slightly goofy grin.  
“早上好。”他回答道，露出了一个宽大且略显傻气的笑容。

_They had been married for three years now... And it had taken some getting used to.. But they were happy.She had given up acting to be with him and...  
他们已经结婚三年了……这需要一些时间来适应……但他们很幸福。她为了和他在一起放弃了演艺事业……_

" Tanith!" Asuka chuckled, looking to the bedroom door -which coincendentially was open now, to stare at their three year old daughter.  
“塔妮丝！”明日香轻笑出声，转向卧室门——巧合的是，现在门是开着的，她凝视着他们三岁的女儿。

_Tanith Joss Marie Ikari..The most adorable little heathen in existence. An angel with horns and pitchfork.  
塔妮丝·乔斯·玛丽·碇……这个世界上最可爱的小淘气。一个带着角和叉子的天使。_

She had Asuka's red locks and blue eyes, with his complection, nose and musical aptitude (if you could only hear her going at the toddler piano they had purchased earlier that month...).  
她继承了明日香的红发和蓝眸，还有他的肤色、鼻型和音乐天赋（如果你能听到她那个月初刚买的幼儿钢琴上弹奏的声音……）。

The bundle of joy-and mischief- threw herself onto the bed -knowing quite well- that someone would catch her before she caused herself harm.  
这个充满欢乐与调皮的小家伙扑向床铺——心里清楚得很——总会有人在关键时刻接住她，不让她受伤。

_This was them, their life.. Their place together._And that is how they got there.  
这就是他们，他们的生活……他们共同的地方。而他们就是这样走到一起的。

Okay, that is my cute little one shot, fluffy fic. I was feeling like I should write something of that variety just because... I really hate the serious lack of good Asuka/Shinji fics. I think given the proper circumstances that they can be a really great couple the author rambles on... . ;; I am seriously A+S all the way! Seriously! . Anyway.. Review please?  
好了，这就是我那篇可爱的小短篇，温馨小品。我总觉得应该写点这类的东西，只是因为……我真的讨厌缺乏优质的明日香/真嗣同人文。我认为在适当的情况下，他们可以成为非常棒的一对，作者继续絮絮叨叨……。 ;; 我绝对是 A+S 的忠实粉丝！真的！ . 总之.. 请留下评论吧？

And yes, it is quite tragic that I had to kill Misato off to bring the Second and Third child closer together. But, hey, we all knew it was going to happen. I mean, what do you think happens to your liver when you drink that much beer? Its tragic. I'm sorry Ari TT.TT;;  
是的，为了拉近二号和三号机驾驶员的距离，我不得不让美里牺牲，这确实很悲惨。但是，嘿，我们都知道这迟早会发生。我是说，你喝那么多啤酒，肝脏会怎么样？这很悲剧。对不起，阿里 TT.TT;;

And.. umm.. the rest of the cast.. umm... Well... ;;  
至于.. 嗯.. 其他角色.. 嗯... 好吧... ;;

And lastly, Himmelsbote means Angel in German.. Just thought you'd like to know.  
最后，Himmelsbote 在德语中意为天使。只是觉得你会想知道。

### Comment
[birthofthecool](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2684346/birthofthecool):
That is news to me, that "Himmelsbote" means Angel.  
这对我来说是新闻，“Himmelsbote”意思是天使。  
  
When I grew up here, Angels were still called "Engel" in my language, perhaps you know the Rammstein Song?  
当我在这里长大时，天使在我语言中仍被称为“Engel”，也许你知道 Rammstein 的那首歌？  
  
"Himmelsbote" is one name you can give to angels, but it means Engel the same way Heavenly Messenger would mean it.  
“Himmelsbote”是天使的一种称呼，但它和“Engel”或“天使命使”的意思是一样的。  
  
And furthermore, "Himmelsbote" is such a wimpy, trashy name, it's pur "kitsch," perhaps a transsexual Media-bitch would choose a name like this, but not a real actress.  
而且，“Himmelsbote”这个名字太软弱、太俗气了，简直就是“媚俗”，或许一个变性媒体婊会选择这样的名字，但真正的女演员可不会。  
  
Apart from this horrible name, I rather liked your little story.  
除了这个糟糕的名字，我倒挺喜欢你的小故事。  
  
well done! 干得好！

[Withdrawn](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/955002/Withdrawn): That was a very cute little fic. I like it alot, and the ending along with the 'morning after' were perfect, and hilarious, my only problems are that Shinji, in my opinion, has more guts than made out at the beginning of the fic, and the other thing is that I don't think such a thing would happen to Misato, for a few reasons, one is that my father used to drink a hell of alot more than Misato, and his liver is surprisingly undamaged, plus I don't think that the writers would kill her off like that, they'd have probably, if they let her grow old, had here die of old age, surrounded by friends and family upon her death bed, chuckling at some joke. But oh well, this wasn't half bad.  
这篇小故事非常可爱。我很喜欢，结尾和‘第二天早晨’的部分既完美又搞笑。我唯一的问题是，在我看来，真嗣在故事开头表现得比实际更有勇气，另一个问题是，我不认为这种事会发生在美里身上，有几个原因，一是我父亲曾经比美里喝得多得多，但他的肝脏却出奇地完好，另外我也不认为编剧会那样让她死去，如果他们让她活到老，可能会让她在亲友的环绕下，笑着某个笑话，安详地因年老而逝去。不过嘛，这篇作品也不算差。

jasmine: I AM SO ASUKA/SHINJI CRAZY! I just started watching evangelion and i love it. I think Asuka and Shinji are the perfect couple. Y there r so many more Shinji and Rei fanfics i have no earthly idea... good fluffy one shot! Oopsie i rambled on more than u...  
我对明日香和真嗣简直着迷了！我刚看《新世纪福音战士》就爱上了。我觉得明日香和真嗣是绝配。为什么有那么多真嗣和绫波的同人文，我真是搞不懂...这篇温馨的短篇真不错！哎呀，我好像说得太多了...
