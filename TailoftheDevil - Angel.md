### Chapter 1: I Live With Two Beautiful Angels!  
第一章：我与两位美丽天使同住！  

_Another name for this story could be: **The Asuka Langley Soryu Raising Project**. But I have a fetish for one-word story titles, so that didn't happen xD This story is slightly based on, yes you guessed it, **The Shinji Ikari Raising Project**! The manga, although the video game will have its references scattered around the story, here and there. Shinji starts out a lot more upbeat than he would normally be, but there is a reason for that, so bear with me!  
这个故事的另一个名字可能是：《惣流·明日香·兰格雷养成计划》。但我对单字标题情有独钟，所以没有采用那个名字 xD 这个故事在一定程度上是基于——没错，你猜对了——《碇真嗣养成计划》！虽然是以漫画为基础，但游戏中也会散落一些相关参考。真嗣一开始比平时要开朗得多，但这背后是有原因的，请耐心听我道来！_

The gentle rays of the morning sun peeked through the small gap in the curtain, reflecting the slowly falling dust floating lazily to the floor. The light managed to reach the face of a teenage boy who was fast asleep. A peaceful expression was etched on his face as he continued to enjoy a pleasant dream.  
清晨的阳光温柔地透过窗帘的缝隙，映照着缓缓飘落的尘埃，慵懒地落向地面。光线恰好照在了一个熟睡的少年脸上。他面带安详的表情，继续沉浸在美好的梦境中。

Mere inches away from him, a girl was breathing heavily, a furious, bright red blush on her face. She had light brown hair that she normally kept tied in twintails, but having woken up not that long ago, it lay tousled as she leaned over the sleeping boy, wrestling with her emotions. Her soft blue eyes looked over his face as loose strands of her hair fell over his nose and cheek.  
离他仅几英寸远的地方，一个女孩正急促地呼吸着，脸上泛起一片鲜艳的绯红。她有着浅棕色的头发，平时总是扎成双马尾，但因为刚醒来不久，头发凌乱地垂在熟睡的男孩上方，内心挣扎不已。她柔软的蓝眼睛凝视着他的脸庞，几缕发丝轻轻落在他的鼻尖和脸颊上。

She was debating whether or not to wake him normally, as was her intention when she first walked into this room, or to wake him with a raunchy morning kiss. Compounding the problem was the fact that she had only recently realised, within the last week or so, that she was madly in love with this boy. The soul with the name Shinji Ikari had been her childhood friend since forever, but her feelings had been evolving, growing and growing to the point where she could no longer deny that the spell had been cast.  
她在犹豫是像最初走进这房间时的打算那样正常叫醒他，还是用一个挑逗的早安吻来唤醒他。问题更加复杂的是，她最近才意识到，大约就在上周左右，她已经疯狂地爱上了这个男孩。名为碇真嗣的灵魂自幼便是她的青梅竹马，但她的感情一直在变化，不断增长，直到她再也无法否认那个魔咒已经降临。

She leaned in closer, close enough that she could feel his gentle breathing tickling the tip of her nose. Her mind was pretty much made up. Edging closer and closer to the prize, she began to close her eyes as she readied herself. This was going to be her first kiss.  
她更靠近了些，近到能感受到他轻柔的呼吸拂过她鼻尖。她的心意已决。她一步步接近目标，准备就绪时开始闭上眼睛。这将是一个初吻。

Nanometres away from Shinji's lips, she was seconds away from success when a grouchy voice echoed from the other room.  
距离碇真嗣的唇仅剩纳米之遥，她即将成功之际，另一间房里传来了一个不悦的声音。

"Asuka! How long does it take to wake a teenage boy? You're both gonna be late for school!"  
"明日香！叫醒一个青春期男孩要多久？你们上学都要迟到了！"

Their guardian, Misato Katsuragi, could be heard swigging a morning beer as she busied herself getting ready. Asuka could hear footsteps moving closer to the door, causing her to panic.  
他们的监护人，葛城美里，一边忙着准备，一边可以听到她在喝早上的啤酒。明日香听到脚步声越来越靠近门，这让她感到慌张。

"Just give me a second Misato!" Sighing with regret, she began to shake her unrequited love's shoulder until groaning could be heard.  
"再给我一秒钟，美里！"" 她叹了口气，带着遗憾开始摇晃她单相思的爱人的肩膀，直到听到呻吟声。

"Just another couple minutes, please..."  
“再等几分钟就好……”

"No can do Baka. We gotta get breakfast going. Hell, even Misato's awake before you today." Standing up, she made for the door. One of Shinji's eyelids cracked open, catching a glimpse of Asuka wearing a simple yellow vest top and short shorts that left very little to the imagination. As she walked out of his room, he allowed himself a small grin. He had been awake the whole time since Asuka first entered the room, keeping it secret that he was already conscious. He was aware that Asuka had been doing strange things like this for a while, but he wasn't yet quite sure how to deal with it. The girl baffled his mind. Was she in heat? He was sure if he mentioned the idea, he'd meet the receiving end of some sharp object and be a lot worse off for it. Was she in love? With him?  
“不行啊，笨蛋。我们得准备早餐了。天哪，就连美里小姐今天都比你早起。”她站起身，朝门口走去。真嗣的一只眼皮微微睁开，瞥见明日香穿着一件简单的黄色背心和短裤，几乎没遮住什么。她走出他的房间时，他忍不住微微一笑。其实从明日香刚进房间起，他就一直醒着，只是偷偷装睡。他知道明日香最近一直在做这些奇怪的事，但他还没完全弄明白该怎么应对。这个女孩让他摸不着头脑。她是在发情吗？他敢肯定，如果他提出这个想法，肯定会遭到某种尖锐物体的攻击，后果不堪设想。她是在爱恋吗？对他？

Making a sound somewhere between a snort and a chuckle, Shinji got out of bed and began to pull on his regular school clothes. He was about as attractive as a mouse, and had the charisma of a fart, there was no way in hell she was attracted to him.  
真嗣发出一声介于哼声和轻笑之间的声音，从床上爬起来，开始穿上他平常的校服。他就像只老鼠一样不起眼，魅力也不过尔尔，她怎么可能对他有意思。

But the fact was, mere moments ago, the beautiful half-European bombshell of a girl he had lived with for a considerably long time now had tried to kiss him. He had never been this confused in his entire life.  
但事实是，就在片刻之前，那个与他同居了相当长时间的美丽欧亚混血女孩，竟然试图吻他。他这辈子从未如此困惑过。

As he walked out of the room, he yawned again, already exhausted from having to think so hard this early in the morning.  
当他走出房间时，他又打了个哈欠，一大早就得这么费神，他已经感到疲惫不堪了。

"What do people want for breakfast?"  
“人们早餐想吃什么？”

In response to his question directed to the household at large, Asuka ran out of the kitchen, now wearing her regular school uniform. Forcing a slice of toast into his mouth, she ran into her room whilst yelling at him.  
面对他向全家人提出的问题，明日香从厨房冲了出来，此刻已换上了她平时的校服。她强行将一片吐司塞进嘴里，一边跑向自己的房间，一边对他大喊。

"There's no time! We've overslept, we gotta get to school, asap!"  
“没时间了！我们睡过头了，得赶紧去学校，立刻马上！”

"Wait, what about breakfast?!" A horrified Misato sounded out her fears from her bedroom. If there was no time to make something for her, she would have to make herself something. An apocalyptic scenario if there ever was one.  
“等等，那早餐怎么办？！”美里从卧室里惊恐地表达出她的担忧。如果没时间给她准备，她就得自己动手了。这简直是末日般的情景。

"Don't you start your new job today? Aren't you late?" Asuka's muffled voice echoed from her bedroom. Several seconds of silence echoed throughout the house before...  
"你今天不是开始新工作吗？不会迟到了吧？" 明日香从卧室里传来的声音有些模糊。几秒钟的沉默在家中回荡，随后...

"OH SHIT, I'M LATE!" "我靠，要迟到了！"

Shinji grinned as he wandered into his bedroom to grab his bag. First day back at school for the new semester and things were going fabulously. As he made his way to the door, the two female cohabitants barrelled out their respective bedrooms, Asuka grabbing his arm on the way out of the house, half-eaten toast hanging on for dear life as it bounced wildly from the corner of her mouth.  
真嗣笑着走进卧室去拿书包。新学期第一天返校，一切顺利得不得了。当他走向门口时，两位女室友分别从各自的卧室冲了出来，明日香在出门时抓住了他的手臂，半块吐司顽强地挂在嘴角，随着她狂奔而上下颠簸。

"Have a good day guys, watch the road, don't get hit by cars or anything." Misato yelled from her own vehicle's window as she pumped the ignition. Seconds later, she was racing down the road, speed limits be damned in their entirety.  
"祝你们今天顺利，注意看路，别被车撞了什么的。" 美里从她自己的车窗里喊道，同时发动引擎。几秒钟后，她便疾驰而去，全然不顾限速规定。

"The only car we're going to have to worry about on the roads is that damned Alpine she drives." Asuka breathed as they both ran towards the station. After a lengthy ten minute jog to the station, they touched through the station gates with their cards and just barely made the train as the doors began to close.  
"在路上我们唯一需要担心的车就是她那辆该死的阿尔派。" 明日香喘着气说，他们俩一起跑向车站。经过长达十分钟的慢跑，他们用卡片刷过车站闸门，就在车门即将关闭之际，勉强赶上了火车。

"That... was... too close..." Asuka panted as she caught her breath. Shinji nodded in agreement, eyes fixed to the floor as his lungs stopped trying to kill him. He slowly stood up, catching his balance, when his first trial of the morning began by fire.  
"那...真是...太险了..." 明日香喘着气，终于缓过气来。真嗣点头表示同意，目光紧盯着地面，他的肺部终于不再试图置他于死地。他慢慢站起身，稳住平衡，而早晨的第一个考验就这样突然降临。

His beautiful roommate was sweating from all the running they'd just finished in the sweltering Japanese summer heat, causing her white shirt to look a little see-through in certain areas. And amongst that, it seems like they had been in far too much of a hurry for her to remember to wear a bra...  
他那美丽的室友因为刚在酷热的日本夏日中奔跑而满头大汗，使得她的白衬衫在某些地方显得有些透明。而且，似乎他们当时太过匆忙，她甚至忘了穿胸罩……

He felt his face ignite as a hot, red flush crawled up his face. There was a fair amount of people crowded onto this train, and one look at the wrong angle, and Asuka might begin to be considered an exhibitionist.  
他感到自己的脸庞像被点燃了一样，一阵火热的红晕爬上了脸颊。这辆列车上挤满了人，只要一个不恰当的角度看过去，明日香就可能被误认为是暴露狂。

"Asuka..." He whispered frantically. "Come here!"  
“明日香……”他急切地低声呼唤，“过来这里！”

He received a look of confused anger for his trouble, but he didn't really care about her temper at the moment. Motioning with his hand, Asuka eventually came over to his side. He prayed to every god that would listen to protect him from the consequences of his forthcoming actions, and quickly wrapped his arms around the German girl. Her face lit up crimson as she began to try and push herself away, she wasn't anywhere near mentally prepared for Shinji's sudden forwardness.  
他为此得到了一个既困惑又愤怒的眼神，但他此刻并不太在意她的脾气。用手示意，明日香最终还是来到了他身边。他向每一位愿意倾听的神明祈祷，保佑他免受即将采取行动的后果，然后迅速用双臂环抱住这位德国女孩。她的脸颊顿时变得通红，开始试图推开他，她完全没有心理准备应对真嗣这突如其来的亲近。

"What the hell are you doing, idiot Shinji!?"  
“你到底在干什么，笨蛋真嗣？！”

"You appear to have a slight wardrobe malfunction, and I'm protecting you from the lecherous idiots that share our train."  
“你似乎有点衣着上的小问题，我在保护你免受那些和我们同乘一车的色狼们的骚扰。”

"I count you as one of those idiots as well, asshole! The hell are you talking about, 'wardrobe malfunction'?" Asuka looked down at her dress, before quickly realising Shinji had made the right, if unexpected move.  
"我把你也算作那些白痴之一了，混蛋！你到底在说什么，'服装故障'？" 明日香低头看了看自己的裙子，随即迅速意识到，尽管出乎意料，但真嗣的举动是正确的。

"You have got to be joking..."  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧..."

"See?" Shinji grinned. "For my actions in the line of duty, I deserve immunity from concussion after this is all over."  
"看吧？" 真嗣咧嘴一笑。"就凭我在任务中的表现，这一切结束后，我应该免受脑震荡之苦。

"You'll be lucky not to get my foot up your ass as soon as we get off this damn train." Asuka mumbled as she held onto Shinji's shirt. "Don't you dare move until then. I hope to god Hikari's got a spare bra I can steal..."  
"下了这该死的火车，你最好祈祷别让我一脚踹你屁股上。" 明日香咕哝着，紧紧抓着真嗣的衬衫。"在那之前你敢动一下试试。希望老天保佑，光有备用的胸罩让我偷..."

"Will that even fit?" "那能合适吗？"

"What in the hell are you trying to say Ikari!? Hikari and me are roughly the same size..."  
"你到底想说什么，碇真嗣！？我和光身材差不多..."

"Fantastic, I now know roughly the bra size of our class president." Shinji grinned as he thought of informing Toji when he survived this particular hell.  
"太棒了，我现在大概知道我们班长的胸围了。" 真嗣咧嘴一笑，想着如果能从这场特别的炼狱中活下来，一定要告诉透治。

"Why do you know my bra size!?" Asuka hissed, her face could boil water instantly. "Asshole! Pervert!" She began beating his chest angrily.  
"你怎么会知道我的胸围！？" 明日香低声怒斥，她的脸瞬间红得能烧开水。"混蛋！变态！" 她开始愤怒地捶打他的胸膛。

"Hey, who does all of the washing in our house?"  
"嘿，家里所有的衣服都是谁洗的？"

"Fair point, but that doesn't mean you have to memorise this stuff!"  
"说得好，但这并不意味着你必须记住这些！"

"To be fair, I wash all of the clothes so often, I could recite Misato and your sizes from memory easily. Let me think, I'm sure you're something like a B-cup, and your..." A firm grasp on his ear made for an abrupt punctuation.  
"说真的，我洗了那么多衣服，很容易就能从记忆中背出美里和你尺码。让我想想，我肯定你是 B 罩杯，还有你的..." 他耳朵被紧紧抓住，话音戛然而止。

"Try telling the whole damn train Shinji, see what happens." The man standing behind Asuka shifted uncomfortably. The pain increased on Shinji's ear, and only stopped after a sharp yelp of pain escaped his lips.  
"试试告诉整列火车的人，真嗣，看看会发生什么。"站在明日香身后的男人不安地挪动着。真嗣的耳朵疼痛加剧，直到他发出一声痛苦的尖叫才停止。

"I'm sorry!" He half-meant it too. Back in the day, he had been too nervous to even talk to Asuka. Being able to tease her like his was something out of a dream, and he wanted to relish every second of it. Rolling her eyes, Asuka buried her head into his chest, partly to escape their confounding situation, but partly as a way to enjoy Shinji's scent under pretense.  
"对不起！" 他这话也半真半假。回想当初，他紧张得连和明日香说话都不敢。如今能像这样逗弄她，简直是梦寐以求的事，他想要好好享受每一刻。明日香翻了个白眼，把头埋进他的胸膛，一方面是为了逃避这令人困惑的处境，另一方面也是借机享受真嗣的气息，尽管是假借名义。

"Stupid idiot..." She mumbled to herself.  
"笨蛋..." 她喃喃自语。

What felt like an entirely too-short eternity to them both later, they arrived at their stop, after which they raced to their classroom, just making it in the nick of time. After a hasty conversation with the class president, Asuka and Hikari quickly dashed for the girls locker room, returning with a satisfied smile on both girls faces. Asuka's smile quickly turned to irritation after spotting Shinji's knowing grin and sat down on her chair, her mood in a strange place between sour and bashful after the events of the morning replayed in her head. Caught up in her bubbly daydream, she didn't even notice as their usual, old and frail homeroom teacher wandered in.  
对他们两人来说，仿佛是过于短暂的永恒之后，他们到达了目的地，随后便冲向教室，刚好赶在最后一刻。与班长匆忙交谈后，明日香和光速奔向女更衣室，回来时两人脸上都带着满意的微笑。看到真嗣那副了然于心的笑容，明日香的笑容迅速转为恼怒，坐回自己的椅子上，早晨发生的事在脑海中重播，让她心情复杂，既酸涩又羞涩。沉浸在欢快的白日梦中，她甚至没注意到他们那老迈衰弱的班主任缓缓走进教室。

"Good morning class. I have an announcement. I may have mentioned to everyone last week how this class would be getting a new homeroom teacher soon, and I am pleased to announced she has arrived, albeit five minutes late for her first day." The class giggled in response, with Shinji agreeing with the crowd. Asuka, on the other hand, had a sudden sinking feeling that she couldn't quite explain.  
"同学们早上好。我有个通知。上周我可能跟大家提过，这门课很快会有新的班主任，我很高兴地宣布她已经到了，尽管她第一天就迟到了五分钟。" 班级里响起一阵轻笑，真嗣也随声附和。然而，明日香却突然感到一种难以名状的沉重感。

"Without further ado, if you would please, Miss..."  
"废话不多说，请您，小姐……"

"Katsuragi." A familiar voice echoed from the front of the class as an equally similar head of purple hair walked pridefully into their classroom. Their guardian, looking slightly tousled after what must have been plenty of near-death experiences with other vehicles, was standing at the front of the class, grinning directly at her two roommates.  
"葛城。" 一个熟悉的声音从教室前方传来，同样熟悉的紫色头发骄傲地走进了教室。他们的监护人，看起来在经历了无数次与死神擦肩而过的车辆事故后略显凌乱，站在教室前，直接对着她的两个室友咧嘴笑。

"Good morning class, I'm sorry for the delay. As mentioned before, my name is Misato Katsuragi, and starting today, I'm going to be your new homeroom teacher! I hope we can all get along and have an awesome year together!" No sooner had she stopped talking then all the boys in the class erupted into cheers. The cheers stopped quickly however, when two indignantly loud voices cut through all of the noise and screamed as loud as they could.  
"同学们早上好，很抱歉迟到了。之前提过，我叫葛城美里，从今天开始，我就是你们的新班主任了！希望我们能相处融洽，共同度过一个精彩的一年！"她话音刚落，班上的男生们就爆发出欢呼声。然而，欢呼声很快就被两声愤怒的大喊打断，那声音盖过了所有的噪音，尖锐而响亮。

"YOU COULD'VE GIVEN US A LIFT EARLIER!"  
"你本可以早点载我们一程的！"

### Chapter 2: Gods of Creation  
第二章：创世之神  

"Honey, I'm serious!" “亲爱的，我是认真的！”

"Gendo, I think you're finally starting to crack..."  
“源堂，我觉得你终于开始崩溃了……”

"Yui, I'm not losing it. I have a daughter, her name is Hitagi Senjougahara!"  
"结衣，我没有疯。我有个女儿，她叫战场原黑仪！"

"No dear, you have a son. His name is Shinji Ikari. Unless you've been hiding something from me for all these years. But thankfully I have the past experience to know that you're dreams go out of control at the touch of a hat."  
"不，亲爱的，你有个儿子。他叫碇真嗣。除非这些年你一直对我有所隐瞒。但幸好我有过去的经验，知道你的梦境一触即发就会失控。"

"...and she has a boyfriend called Koyomi Araragi, who saved her from her disease of weightlessness caught from the crabs."  
"……而且她有个男朋友叫阿良良木历，他救她摆脱了从螃蟹那里感染的失重病。"

"For the love of god..."  
"看在上帝的份上..."

The two scientists sat over the diagram readouts, mumbling to each other over cups of strong coffee. Both looked completely exhausted, and Gendo's eyes danced around the room, his lack of sleep for over seventy-two hours beginning to spark insanity in his mind, whilst his wife looked on disgruntled. She was used to her husband being a little crazy sometimes, but the lack of sleep to her was testing her patience. Plus, the potential miracle of an experiment they were waiting to test was driving her mad. Having to wait to see the unbelievable that you knew was coming was testing her normally gentle and patient personality.  
两位科学家坐在图表读数前，一边喝着浓咖啡一边喃喃自语。两人看起来都筋疲力尽，碇源堂的眼睛在房间里四处游移，连续七十多小时未眠开始在他的脑海中点燃疯狂的火花，而他的妻子则不满地看着他。她已经习惯了丈夫偶尔的疯狂，但缺乏睡眠对她来说正在考验她的耐心。此外，他们等待测试的实验潜在的奇迹也在逼疯她。不得不等待见证你明知即将到来的不可思议之事，正在考验她原本温柔耐心的性格。

"...and she had beautiful, long purple hair."  
"...而她有着美丽的长长的紫色头发。"

"Gendo! We've got only a few hours before we have to let the kids know the experiments that will change their lives forever. And we sure as hell can't trust Kyoko to do it! Get your head out of your ass and focus!"  
"源堂！我们只剩下几个小时就要告诉孩子们那些将永远改变他们生活的实验了。而且我们绝对不能指望绫波零来做这件事！别再逃避现实，集中精神！"

"...she was a bit of a bitch though. All tsundere, killed all the cute." With her blood vessels reaching a critical breaking point, Yui Ikari cracked her husband around the head with a heavy folder.  
"...她虽然有点泼辣。典型的傲娇，把可爱都扼杀了。" 随着血管濒临破裂的临界点，碇唯用一个厚重的文件夹猛击了丈夫的头。

"You're going to be the death of me one of these days..." Yui mumbled as she massaged her aching head.  
""你总有一天会把我气死的..."" 碇唯一边嘟囔着，一边揉着疼痛的头部。

---

With the shock of their new homeroom teacher finally beginning to recede, Asuka hung her head behind her chair, staring at the ceiling. She didn't think she could handle more surprises today. She wanted Shinji's delicious home-cooked bento in her stomach, but lunch was still hours away. Stomach grumbling, she turned to face Shinji, who happened to sit next to her, flashing him a look of practiced annoyance. His response was a confused expression and a shrug, which wasn't the kind of attention she had been looking for.  
随着新班主任带来的震惊逐渐消退，明日香低着头躲在椅子后面，盯着天花板。她觉得今天已经无法再承受更多的惊喜了。她渴望吃到真嗣亲手做的美味便当，但午餐时间还遥遥无期。肚子咕咕叫着，她转向坐在旁边的真嗣，露出了一副惯常的恼怒表情。他的回应却是一脸困惑和耸肩，这并不是她所期待的反应。

Tearing out a scrap of paper from her notepad, she quickly began writing a message.  
她从笔记本上撕下一张纸条，迅速开始写起信息来。

_"I'm bored!" “我好无聊！”_

Having received it, Shinji quickly read the note and glanced at her, flashing a smile that agreed with her.  
收到纸条后，真嗣迅速阅读了一遍，然后瞥了她一眼，露出了一个与她心意相通的微笑。

_"Me too. I'm not paying attention at all. You got any ideas to kill the time?"_ Asuka thought about the response for a little while, until a small grin crept into her expression.  
“我也是，根本没在听。你有什么打发时间的主意吗？”明日香思考了一会儿，直到她的脸上慢慢浮现出一丝微笑。

_"Let's play a game!" “我们来玩游戏吧！”_

_"What kind of game?" “什么类型的游戏？”_

_"20 questions, gone wild!"_ Shinji's eyes widened to impossible sizes as he read the response. It was all she could do to not laugh out loud. After she'd received the affirmative from Shinji, she began their little game.  
“20 个问题，疯狂版！” 真嗣的眼睛瞪得大到不可思议，他读着回复。她尽力忍住不笑出声。在得到真嗣的肯定后，她开始了他们的小游戏。

_"Out of all the girls in the class, who's the cutest?"  
“在班上所有女生中，谁最可爱？”_

_"That's not a fair question..."  
"那问题不公平……"_

_"Answer the damn question, stupid Shinji!"  
"回答那个该死的问题，愚蠢的真嗣！"_

_"A certain fiery fräulein I know..."_ He had the audacity to look sheepish, but his comment made her happy. At least he had noticed she was an attractive organism of the female species. Pencil in his mouth, Shinji finally came up with a question that surprised her.  
""我认识的一位热情的女士……"" 他居然厚颜无耻地露出了尴尬的表情，但他的话让她感到高兴。至少他注意到了她是个有魅力的女性生物。嘴里叼着铅笔，真嗣终于想出了一个让她惊讶的问题。

_"Is there anyone that you like?"_ Her heartbeat flared as she struggled to find an immediate answer. She wasn't mentally ready to tell him that she liked him, but one wrong move and she could hint to Shinji that it wasn't him she liked, dashing her hopes of a future relationship entirely.  
"你有喜欢的人吗？" 她的心跳加速，努力寻找一个即时的答案。她还没准备好告诉他她喜欢他，但一旦说错话，就可能暗示给真嗣她喜欢的不是他，彻底粉碎了她对未来关系的希望。

_"If you mean like as in people I can bear with most on a daily basis, I'd have to choose you I guess."_ After sneaking him the note, she hid her face away from him, afraid she'd let slip her innermost thoughts. She heard a surprised gasp of air coming from his direction, before hearing the pencil scratching on the paper again.  
"如果你是指日常生活中我能忍受最多的人，我想我得选你吧。" 递给他纸条后，她把脸藏了起来，生怕泄露内心的真实想法。她听到他那边传来惊讶的吸气声，然后又听到铅笔在纸上划过的声音。

_"You write incredibly frustrating answers, I have no idea what that means in the female language."  
"你写的答案真是让人抓狂，我完全不懂这在女性语言里是什么意思。"_

She came close to whacking him across the head with her textbook, but settled with glaring at him as though looks could cause people to spontaneously combust.  
她差点用教科书敲他的头，但最终只是狠狠地瞪着他，仿佛眼神能让人自燃。

_"Read too much into it and I'll have you for lunch instead of the damn bento!"  
“别想太多，不然我可要把你当午餐吃了，而不是那该死的便当！”_

As soon as she handed it over, she regretted writing the response. She meant it as something angry, but replaying the words in her head and it began to sound... flirty? Her fears were confirmed when Shinji covered his mouth, trying not to laugh. Whimpering in exasperation, she buried her head in her arms on her desk. The rest of the day passed by in a slow, painful, agonizing fashion.  
她一递过去就后悔写了那个回复。本意是表达愤怒，但回想起来，那些话听起来...有点挑逗？当真嗣捂住嘴，努力不笑出声时，她的担忧得到了证实。她懊恼地呜咽一声，把头埋在桌上的手臂里。剩下的时间里，日子过得缓慢、痛苦且煎熬。

"This is so disappointing."  
这真是太令人失望了。

"Gendo, focus!" "源堂，专注点！"

"But, but...!" Gendo Ikari was looking at his son, a mixture of disappointment and fear written over his face. "That's not my precious Hitagi!"  
"但是，但是...！" 碇源堂看着他的儿子，脸上交织着失望和恐惧。"那不是我珍贵的战场原！"

"...what?" Shinji mumbled, incredibly confused at his incomprehensible father's words.  
"...什么？" 真嗣喃喃自语，对他的父亲那难以理解的话语感到极度困惑。

"Hitagi! My daughter!" “黑仪！我的女儿！”

_***WHACK* *啪***_

The elder Ikari male crumpled to the ground, with Yui Ikari standing over him, a look of pure rage covering her face.  
老式的碇家男性倒在地上，碇唯站在他上方，脸上覆盖着纯粹的愤怒。

"That's enough! Sleep there for a few minutes, I can do the introduction by myself at least." Both Asuka and Shinji looked suitably horrified. Shinji's mother rarely ever displayed anger, so whenever her rage did display itself, it was terrifying.  
"够了！在那儿睡几分钟吧，至少我自己能做个介绍。" 明日香和真嗣都露出了适度的惊恐。真嗣的母亲很少表现出愤怒，所以每当她的怒火显现时，都极其可怕。

"We've brought you here today to explain to you the nature of our experiments. Neither of us have slept for over three days, so your father is going insane and I'm getting a little... irritated." Yui walked over to a nearby laptop connected to the ceiling-mounted projector, flicking everything on. The room dimmed as one of the walls parallel to the two teenagers lit-up with an image. From what they could tell, they were looking at a simple, white-walled room with nothing inside. There didn't seem to be anything interesting about the room, and Shinji looked at his mother fearfully.  
"今天带你们来这里，是为了向你们解释我们的实验性质。我们俩已经超过三天没睡觉了，所以你父亲快疯了，而我也有点...烦躁。" 绫波走到一台连接着天花板投影仪的笔记本电脑旁，打开了所有设备。房间暗了下来，与两个青少年平行的墙壁亮起了一张图像。从他们能看到的来看，这是一个空无一物的简单白色墙壁房间。这个房间似乎没有什么有趣的地方，真嗣害怕地看着他的母亲。

"...maybe you've both been in here a little too long, mother."  
"...也许你们俩在这里待得太久了，妈妈。"

A fierce look of boiling anger was his response, causing Shinji to whimper like a rabbit, cowering behind Asuka. The German girl had given him enough scary looks that he thought he was ready for anything, but even Asuka herself was shaking in fear.  
他眼中燃烧的怒火如此猛烈，让真嗣像兔子一样呜咽着，躲在明日香身后瑟瑟发抖。德国女孩给他的可怕眼神已经够多了，他以为自己已经无所畏惧，但就连明日香自己也在恐惧中颤抖。

"Admittedly, it doesn't look like much, but that room is the single, most advanced example of virtual reality engineering in the world. What you're looking at is the room in its default state. I need the both of you to go into that room, and... test its capabilities." After a flick of a switch, a small door materialized underneath the projected image.  
“诚然，它看起来并不起眼，但那房间是世界上最为先进的虚拟现实工程实例。你们现在看到的是它的默认状态。我需要你们两个进入那个房间，并……测试它的性能。”随着开关轻轻一拨，投影图像下方凭空出现了一扇小门。

"Go." At her encouragement, Asuka and Shinji walked towards the door and pushed it open. The exact same room as they had seen on the projection greeted them.  
“去吧。”在她的鼓励下，明日香和真嗣走向那扇门，推开它。映入眼帘的，正是他们在投影中看到的那个房间。

_"Stand in the middle."_ Yui's voice could now be heard over a communications system, the metallic voice reverberating around the room. As they were told, they stood in the middle of the room, looking at each other with confused faces.  
"站在中间。" 通过通讯系统，Yui 的声音现在可以被听到，金属质感的声音在房间里回荡。正如他们被告知的那样，他们站在房间中央，面面相觑，脸上带着困惑的表情。

As she was typing furiously into the computer, Gendo began to awaken, getting to his feet as held his aching head. Yui noticed the sound of her husband returning to consciousness and swiftly pointed to the projection of the room, now with the two teenagers inside.  
当她疯狂地在电脑上打字时，Gendo 开始苏醒，他站起身来，手扶着疼痛的头。Yui 注意到丈夫恢复意识的声音，迅速指向房间的投影，现在里面有两个青少年。

"It's your cue." "轮到你了。"

Gendo nodded as he looked towards the projection. Inside the now sealed room, his face appeared before the two children as a small, floating window.  
源堂点头，目光转向投影。在如今已被封闭的房间内，他的脸出现在两个孩子面前，化作一个小小的悬浮窗口。

_"You are both now inside a virtual reality. However, your bodies are still physical, meaning you will be able to touch anything around you as though it existed in real life."  
“你们现在身处虚拟现实之中。不过，你们的身体仍然是实体的，这意味着你们能够像周围的一切真实存在一样去触摸它们。”_

"We can... touch virtual objects? That's breaking a few laws of physics, isn't it?" Asuka said in disbelief towards the floating image of Shinji's father. The face smiled mischievously back at her.  
“我们可以……触摸虚拟物体？这岂不是打破了物理定律吗？”明日香对着悬浮的碇司令影像表示怀疑。那张脸则带着一丝狡黠的微笑回望着她。

_"Would you like an example? Shinji, imagine a small animal, like a cat on the floor in front of you."  
"想要个例子吗？真嗣，想象一下你面前地板上有只小动物，比如一只猫。"_

With an exasperated expression directed towards Asuka, Shinji began to look at the floor, imagining a jet-black cat. Within seconds, a physical cat appeared before them, looking up at them, slightly confused as to why it was there.  
带着对明日香无奈的表情，真嗣开始注视地板，想象着一只乌黑的猫。几秒钟内，一只实体的猫出现在他们面前，抬头看着他们，略显困惑为何自己会在这里。

"You have got to be joking...!" Asuka slowly breathed as she watched the cat walk towards her, and physically rub its head on her leg. "How...!? I can feel it!"  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧...！" 明日香缓缓呼吸着，看着那只猫向她走来，用头蹭着她的腿。"怎么可能...！我能感觉到它！"

_"It's a confirmed success!"_ An incredibly overexcited sounding Yui Ikari shrieked from the communications channel. _"Stability at eighty-seven percent, no problems with the children's physical composition. Phase two, go!"_ She yelled the final words at Gendo, who clapped his hands with excitement.  
"确认成功了！" 通讯频道中传来极为兴奋的绫波唯的声音。"稳定性达到百分之八十七，孩子们的身体结构没有问题。第二阶段，开始！" 她对着碇源堂大喊，碇源堂兴奋地拍手。

_"Next, Asuka, we need you to imagine an environment. Anything will do, but try not to overcomplicate it. Somewhere you would be familiar with would be ideal."  
"接下来，明日香，我们需要你想象一个环境。任何地方都可以，但尽量不要过于复杂。选择一个你熟悉的地方会更好。"_

Her look of shock widened as Asuka looked back at Shinji, the black cat now in her arms as it purred contentedly. She closed her eyes, and a few seconds later, the classroom that they had been studying in only hours beforehand materialized around them. The detail was immaculate, and apart from the lack of other students, everything was a perfect replication of the room at their school.  
明日香看着怀中那只黑色猫咪，它正满足地咕噜咕噜叫着，她的震惊表情更加明显。她闭上眼睛，几秒钟后，他们几小时前还在学习的教室在他们周围实体化了。细节完美无缺，除了缺少其他学生外，一切都完美复制了学校的那个房间。

_"Phase Two, success! Anomalies holding steady at five percent, possibly due to hosts imagination processes. Phase three!"_ Yui was pounding the keyboard so fast, she was beginning to worry about her fingers breaking from the pressure.  
"第二阶段，成功！异常稳定在百分之五，可能是由于宿主的想象过程所致。第三阶段！" 结衣敲击键盘的速度如此之快，她开始担心自己的手指会因压力而断裂。

_"This time, Shinji, we need you to imagine a location from a long time ago, something you won't remember perfectly."_ His father directed him, and Shinji nodded, beginning to concentrate on a forest that his family had once taken him to when he was six-years old.  
"这次，真嗣，我们需要你想象一个很久以前的地点，一些你不会记得很清楚的东西。" 他的父亲指导他，真嗣点头，开始集中精神回想一个他六岁时家人带他去过的森林。

Slowly this time, the forest in his mind began to appear around him. But in certain areas, there were static patches.  
这次慢慢地，他脑海中的森林开始在他周围显现。但在某些区域，出现了静态斑块。

_"Success! Anomalies at sixty percent, host's health remains stable!"  
"成功！异常率 60%，宿主健康状况保持稳定！"_

_"I remember this forest."_ His father looked around the room through his window. Yui turned to him and pointed at the entrance to the room.  
"我记得这片森林。" 他的父亲透过窗户环视房间。Yui 转向他，指向房间的入口。

"Phase four, get in there!" Gendo nodded and hurried to the door, entering and standing next to the two utterly confused children. Closing his eyes, he focused on the same memory that Shinji had summoned.  
"第四阶段，进去吧！" Gendo 点头，急忙走向门口，进入房间并站在两个完全困惑的孩子旁边。他闭上眼睛，专注于与 Shinji 召唤的相同的记忆。

The static patches around them from Shinji's memories began to fuzz and stabilize into the remaining sections of forest that had been missing before. Before long, the complete forest surrounding the three open-mouthed people.  
来自真嗣记忆中的静态片段开始模糊并稳定下来，逐渐填补了之前缺失的森林部分。不久，一片完整的森林环绕在三位目瞪口呆的人周围。

_"Memory Merge, success!"_ Yui was beside herself as she came close to a mental breakdown from excitement. _"Phase four is a success!"_  
“记忆融合，成功！”由依激动得几乎要精神崩溃。“第四阶段成功了！”

Gendo nodded, grinning from ear-to-ear, before turning around and looking at the electrified Shinji and Asuka. Pointing towards the cat, his grin seemed to grow even wider.  
源堂点点头，笑得合不拢嘴，然后转身看向被电击的真嗣和明日香。他指向那只猫，笑容似乎更加灿烂了。

"Take it outside of the room."  
“把它带出房间。”

For everything that had happened so far, the next thing that would await them had seemed to shock them a hundred times more. But when Asuka nervously opened the door to the unbelievable room, and stepped outside holding the imagined cat, which didn't disappear as she exited and shut the door behind her, the realization of the experiments that had happened today would change everything as they knew it suddenly began to dawn on them.  
迄今为止发生的种种，接下来等待他们的似乎是百倍于前的震惊。然而，当明日香紧张地推开那不可思议房间的门，怀抱着想象中的猫踏出房门，那猫并未随她出门并关上门而消失时，今日实验的真相开始在他们心中悄然浮现，彻底颠覆了他们所知的一切。

They had created life, from the imagination of a teenage boy, that persisted and survived from outside its virtual incubator. The cat meowed happily at Asuka, who's eyes were as wide as dinner plates.  
他们从一位少年脑海中的想象里创造了生命，这生命顽强地存活于虚拟孵化器之外。那只猫对着明日香欢快地喵喵叫，她的眼睛瞪得像餐盘一样大。

As of right now, Asuka Langley Soryu and the Ikari family were essentially gods of creation.  
从现在起，明日香·兰格雷·索耶和碇家实质上成为了创造之神。

**_They were gods. 他们是神。_**

### Chapter 3: In Holy Matrimony  
第三章：神圣婚姻  

Asuka was bouncing her leg up and down under her desk as she leaned her face on her hand, trying to look bored. Together with Shinji, they had gone to school the next day after they had become literal gods. So trying to keep a disinterested look was proving to be difficult, as she thought of the million different ways this power could be used.  
明日香一边用手撑着脸，试图装出一副无聊的样子，一边在桌子底下不停地抖腿。她和真嗣在成为名副其实的神之后，第二天就去了学校。现在，她正努力保持一副漠不关心的表情，但脑海中却在思考着这种力量可以用来做无数种事情，这让她很难装得下去。

As a precaution, Shinji's parents had told them under no circumstances were they to tell anyone else about this ability. They had been clever enough to understand that nations from across the world would easily abuse this power, so keeping their mouth shut was of the utmost priority.  
为了以防万一，真嗣的父母告诫他们，无论如何都不能向任何人透露这种能力。他们足够聪明，明白世界各地的国家很容易滥用这种力量，因此守口如瓶是最重要的。

She glanced quickly at the bracelet on her left wrist. It's design looked almost futuristic, a deep crimson color with splashes of red decorated its design. Shinji wore an identical bracelet, although his was a mix of white and blue, complimented with the odd splash of black. These bracelets were designed to give them immediate access to their powers, without having to go back to the room. She wasn't quite sure how it worked, but it was apparently linked to the room in some way, enabling them to summon objects, or change their environment around them at will. And the most frustrating thing about the bracelets was that neither Gendo nor Yui had said a damn thing about how to activate them.  
她迅速瞥了一眼左手腕上的手镯。其设计看起来颇具未来感，深红色为主，点缀着红色斑点。真嗣佩戴着同样款式的手镯，不过他的以白色和蓝色为主，间或夹杂着黑色斑点。这些手镯旨在让他们无需返回房间就能立即使用自己的力量。她不太确定其工作原理，但显然与房间有某种联系，使他们能够随心所欲地召唤物品或改变周围环境。而关于手镯最令人沮丧的一点是，源堂和唯从未透露过如何激活它们。

As Asuka cursed the two mad scientists, the door to the class slid open, revealing Misato looking cheerful.  
当明日香咒骂着那两位疯狂科学家时，教室的门滑开了，露出满脸笑容的美里。

"Good morning, my fellow nutcases. I have some good news for most of you and some bad news for two of you in particular."  
“早上好，我的各位疯子们。我有一些好消息要告诉你们大多数人，也有一些坏消息特别针对你们中的两位。”

"This'll be what she was so excited about this morning." Asuka thought as she recalled their guardian giggling like a drunk schoolgirl whilst they had all been eating breakfast together this morning. It had been in equal parts curious and terrifying. Try as they might, neither she nor Shinji could extract any useful information out of her.  
“这应该就是她今早那么兴奋的原因了。”明日香回忆起今早大家一起吃早餐时，他们的监护人像喝醉的女学生一样咯咯笑个不停。这既让人好奇又感到恐怖。无论她和真嗣怎么努力，都无法从她那里套出任何有用信息。

"I have the pleasure of introducing a new transfer student to everyone today. Please treat her kindly everyone! Miss Ayanami, you may enter."  
“今天我有幸向大家介绍一位新转来的学生。请大家好好待她！绫波同学，你可以进来了。”

At her words, a young girl with eye-catching light-blue hair walked into the classroom. As she turned to face the class, Asuka noticed her eyes were a bright, slightly-unnerving crimson. But more importantly, she noticed that the transfer student bore a startling resemblance to Shinji's mother. And on top of that, she was incredibly cute.  
随着她的话音落下，一位拥有引人注目的淡蓝色头发的少女走进了教室。当她转身面对全班时，明日香注意到她的眼睛是明亮而略显不安的猩红色。但更重要的是，她注意到这位转学生与真嗣的母亲惊人地相似。而且，她还非常可爱。

"I swear to god, if I catch Shinji staring at her, I'm going to..." Asuka muttered as she turned around to look at Shinji. She wasn't expecting his expression to be laced with shock and horror in equal measure. As she wondered what had him so scared, the transfer student began to speak.  
"我发誓，如果我抓到真嗣盯着她看，我就……" 明日香喃喃自语着转过身去看真嗣。她没想到他的表情会如此震惊和恐惧交织。正当她疑惑是什么让他如此害怕时，转学生开始说话了。

"My name is Rei Ayanami, its a pleasure to meet you." She did a small bow, and as she looked up again, Asuka noticed her flash a smile in Shinji's direction. Whipping her head back, she saw that Shinji's expression had grown a hundred times more petrified looking.  
"我叫绫波零，很高兴见到你们。" 她微微鞠了一躬，抬起头时，明日香注意到她向真嗣的方向露出了一个微笑。明日香猛地转过头，看到真嗣的表情变得更加惊恐。

"And be careful boys, she's technically already spoken for!" Misato piped up from her chair near the window. All of the boys looked at her, both horrified and confused at the same time. Winking at Rei, she nodded towards her.  
"还有，男孩们小心点，她理论上已经有主了！" 美里从窗边的椅子上插话道。所有的男生都看向她，既惊恐又困惑。美里对绫波眨了眨眼，向她点头示意。

"It's time to reveal the biggest news of all." It sounded like Misato was having a hard time containing her excitement. Rei nodded, suddenly looking bashful and shy, began to walk towards the centre of the class, specifically to Shinji's chair. After having reached her destination, she smiled at him.  
"是时候揭晓最大的新闻了。" 美里听起来难以抑制她的兴奋。绫波点点头，突然显得害羞起来，开始走向教室中央，特别是向真嗣的椅子走去。到达目的地后，她对他微笑。

"It is good to see you after all this time, Shinji. Here, this is for you." She placed a small box in front of him, a very familiar-looking box.  
"这么久没见，真嗣，很高兴见到你。这个，是给你的。" 她把一个小盒子放在他面前，一个看起来非常眼熟的盒子。

"What on god's green earth is in that box Shinji." Asuka whispered, dreading the answer she knew was most likely coming. Shinji stared at the box, paralyzed in fear. This couldn't be happening. He had thought this whole thing had been forgotten about years ago.  
"那盒子里到底是什么鬼东西，真嗣。" 明日香低声说，害怕即将听到的答案。真嗣盯着盒子，恐惧得动弹不得。这不可能是真的。他以为这一切早在几年前就被遗忘了。

He picked up the box with trembling hands. The whole class waited on baited breath, the atmosphere was electric, to an almost lethal degree. He gently prised open the box, confirming his worst fears. Sitting snugly inside the box were two, sparkling engagement rings.  
他用颤抖的双手拿起盒子。全班屏息以待，气氛紧张到几乎致命的程度。他小心翼翼地打开盒子，证实了自己最深的恐惧。盒子里稳稳地放着两枚闪闪发光的订婚戒指。

The whole class erupted into pandemonium.  
全班顿时陷入一片混乱。

"...what?" Asuka looked mental, with one eye stretched far wider than it should have been able to, a demonic grin danced across her face. "WHAT? WHAAAT!?"  
“...什么？” 明日香看起来精神错乱，一只眼睛睁得比正常能张开的还要大，脸上跳跃着恶魔般的笑容。“什么？什么！？”

"SHINJI, YOU BASTARD!" Toji Suzuhara, his supposed best friend and pillar of support during most of their hard times together, looked about ready to punch him square in the face.  
"真嗣，你这个混蛋！" 他的所谓最好的朋友，也是大多数艰难时刻的支柱，铃原东治看起来几乎要一拳打在他脸上。

"THE HELL IS ALL THIS ABOUT!? You've already chummy with the hottest girl in the school, where the fuck are engagement rings coming from!? With this new chick!?"  
"这他妈的都是怎么回事！？你已经和学校里最火的女孩打得火热了，哪来的订婚戒指！？还是和这个新来的！？"

"Suzuhara, language!" "铃原，注意言辞！"

"Shove it Class Prez! This is a national emergency!" His retort ignited a blazing fire under the temper of their class president, Hikari Horaki. Her face matched Asuka's current expression in terms of pure terror, immediately rushing to Toji and grasping his ear with the strength of an enraged lion.  
"闭嘴，班长！这是全国性的紧急情况！" 他的反驳如同点燃了导火索，激起了班长光里堇的怒火。她的脸色与明日香此刻的表情一样，充满了纯粹的恐惧，立刻冲向东治，用狮子般的力道抓住了他的耳朵。

"Would you like to repeat that, Suzuhara?"  
"你愿意再说一遍吗，铃原？"

Meanwhile, Shinji had about five seconds to live, as his situation changed for the worse when Rei suddenly put his arms around him. A pure explosion of rage erupted from Asuka, as her table went flying across the room.  
与此同时，真嗣的生命只剩下大约五秒钟，因为情况急转直下，零突然抱住了他。明日香爆发出纯粹的愤怒，她的桌子飞过整个房间。

"WHAT ARE YOU DONIG TO HIM!?" She was barely stopping herself from launching at the blue-haired girl, who looked back at her, confused by Asuka's rage.  
“你在对他做什么！？”她几乎控制不住自己冲向那个蓝发女孩，而对方回望着她，对明日香突如其来的愤怒感到困惑。

"I'm simply hugging him. It's been at least six years since I last saw my childhood friend, and it's time for our promise to be fulfilled."  
我只是紧紧拥抱他。自从上次见到儿时好友，至少已有六年光阴，是时候兑现我们的承诺了。

"What. Fucking. Promise?" Asuka aimed the icy question at both Shinji and Rei. "I'm pretty sure I've just crapped myself..." Shinji moaned as the two girls continued to glare at each other.  
“什么。该死的。承诺？”明日香冷冷地向真嗣和绫波发问。“我敢肯定我刚刚吓得尿裤子了……”真嗣呻吟着，两个女孩依旧互相瞪视。

"IKARI, SORYU, LANGUAGE!" Hikari roared from behind him, still wrestling with Toji.  
“伊卡里，索琉，语言！”光从他身后咆哮道，仍在与托吉扭打。

"His father promised my father that we would be engaged to marry when we both came to the right age. It has been a long time coming, but I have been waiting for this day to finally reunite with Shinji, for a long time." Rei glanced down at the terrified boy, a small blush creeping onto her face.  
“他的父亲曾向我父亲承诺，当我们都到了适婚年龄时，我们将订婚结婚。这一天已经等了很久，但我一直在等待与真嗣重逢的这一天，已经很久了。” 绫波瞥了一眼惊恐的男孩，脸上泛起一丝淡淡的红晕。

"But... why...?" Asuka's rage could be heard between every whispered syllable. "Why him?"  
“但是...为什么...？” 明日香的声音中夹杂着愤怒，每个字都几乎在颤抖。“为什么是他？”

A moment's silence passed, as Rei thought about her response. She looked up, a firm determination present in her eyes.  
一阵沉默过后，绫波思考着如何回应。她抬起头，眼中闪烁着坚定的决心。

"Without Shinji Ikari, I would not be alive today."  
没有碇真嗣，我今天就不会活着。

The silence returned, echoing around the classroom. Rei stood up, letting Shinji go.  
沉默再次降临，回荡在教室中。丽站起身，放开了真嗣。

"I was saved from a debilitating illness, not by medicine, nor by the magic of modern day science, but through the kindness that Shinji brought to me, everyday I sat in a lonely medical ward."  
"我被一种顽疾所困，不是药物，也不是现代科学的魔法救了我，而是每天坐在孤独的病房里，真嗣带给我的善意。"

"For most of my life, I had been alone. I hadn't had any real friends, nor was my father around often, due to his job. My mother passed away at a young age, and I was too shy to make any friends of my own. Then, due to unfortunate circumstances, I found myself waking up in a medical ward at NERV, where my father worked. I was told that it would take a miracle to save me from my illness."  
"我大半生都是孤独一人。我没有真正的朋友，父亲也因为工作不常在家。母亲在我年幼时便去世了，而我太害羞，无法结交朋友。后来，由于不幸的境遇，我发现自己醒来时身处 NERV 的医疗病房，那里是我父亲工作的地方。我被告知，要从我的病中得救，需要一个奇迹。"

"It was then I first met Shinji. His parents both worked at NERV, and his father, who is my father's cousin, had brought him to work one day, to show him some of the experiments that were going on. By mistake, Shinji got lost and ended up in my room. And instead of leaving, he stayed with me and chatted with me. We stayed there for hours until his parents eventually discovered him."  
那时我第一次遇见了真嗣。他的父母都在 NERV 工作，而他父亲，也就是我父亲的表弟，某天带他来参观正在进行的一些实验。不巧的是，真嗣迷路了，误打误撞进了我的房间。他没有选择离开，而是留下来和我聊天。我们就这样待了好几个小时，直到他的父母终于找到了他。

"I begged him to stay, and through various circumstances, Shinji was allowed to visit me. Almost everyday he would come to my room, sometimes bringing games to play. And eventually, over time, my illness began to dissipate. Because of those happy days I spent with Shinji, he gave to me a miracle. The only thing I can give to him in return is my love, and everlasting matrimony."  
我恳求他留下，在种种机缘下，真嗣得以来探望我。几乎每天他都会来到我的房间，有时还会带上游戏一起玩。渐渐地，随着时间的推移，我的病情开始好转。因为与真嗣共度的那些快乐时光，他为我带来了奇迹。我能回报给他的，唯有我的爱，以及永恒的婚姻。

The rest of the day passed agonizingly slowly, with Rei and Asuka butting heads with each other at every opportunity. The majority of their teachers were terrified of the spectacle, not to mention Shinji felt a constant fear of dying from a terror-induced heart attack.  
这一天剩下的时间过得异常缓慢，丽和明日香一有机会就互相较劲。大多数老师都对这一幕感到恐惧，更别提真嗣一直担心自己会因惊吓过度而心脏病发作。

The last bell ringing was heavenly music to his ears. He just wanted to go home, eat and sleep the nightmare of the day away. Catching sight of Misato walking towards him, a slightly apologetic expression on her face, he realized that his troubles were far from over.  
最后一声铃响对他而言宛如天籁。他只想回家，吃顿饭，然后睡一觉，把这糟糕的一天抛诸脑后。瞥见美里朝他走来，脸上带着些许歉意的表情，他意识到自己的麻烦远未结束。

"Shinji... How's it going?" She tried to sound as lighthearted as possible, but even she knew how tough today had been on him.  
"真嗣... 还好吗？" 她尽量让自己的语气听起来轻松愉快，但就连她自己也知道今天对他来说有多艰难。

"I want to find my father and strangle him." He said, exasperated. "He told me he had 'smoothed things over' with this promise."  
"我想找到我父亲然后掐死他。" 他气愤地说，"他告诉我他已经‘把事情摆平了’，还用这个承诺来搪塞我。"

"Do you not like Rei?" Misato looked at him quizzically. He shook his head.  
"你不喜欢绫波吗？" 美里疑惑地看着他。他摇了摇头。

"It's not that. It just came out of nowhere, that's all. All these years, I wasn't too worried about it, because I thought Rei saw me as a friend, and nothing else. But then she transfer into my class, declares her love and dedication and I feel like somebody's thrown a metaphorical brick in my face. It's all too sudden, I don't know what's going on..."  
“不是那样的。只是它突然就出现了，仅此而已。这么多年，我并不太担心，因为我以为丽把我当朋友，仅此而已。但后来她转到了我们班，宣布她的爱意和奉献，我感觉像是有人朝我脸上扔了一块隐喻的砖头。这一切都太突然了，我不知道发生了什么...”

Misato nodded sympathetically, ruffling his hair. "I understand kiddo. Love's never an easy battle to fight, especially when you've got a pretty thing like Asuka hanging around day and night. But things will get better."  
美里同情地点点头，揉乱了他的头发。“我理解你，孩子。爱情从来都不是一场容易的战斗，尤其是当你身边有个像明日香这样漂亮的人日夜相伴时。但情况会好转的。”

Her smile quickly turned into a look of panic as she realized something.  
她的微笑迅速变成了惊慌的表情，因为她意识到了什么。

"Actually, wait, scratch that, things are going to get a whole lot worse!" Looking up at her, his own face now in a panic, he trembled at the thought of more bad news involving the girls.  
“实际上，等等，别提了，事情会变得更糟！”他抬头看着她，自己的脸上也露出了惊慌，一想到还会有关于女孩们的坏消息，他就颤抖不已。

"I totally forgot to mention that Rei's moving in with us!"  
“我完全忘了提，丽要搬来和我们一起住了！”

After that, he was instructed to explain the news to Asuka. Misato offered him a stab/bulletproof vest she had for 'reasons'. Politely refusing, he made his way to where she thought she might be. Discovering her in their homeroom classroom, sitting on his desk, swinging her legs as she looked outside, she turned to face him as he walked in. Noticing his grim expression, her own face dropped into a dark scowl.  
之后，他被指示向明日香解释新闻内容。美里递给他一件因某种原因备有的防刺/防弹背心，他礼貌地拒绝了，然后前往她可能所在的地方。在他们的教室里找到她，她正坐在他的桌子上，晃着双腿望向窗外，听到他进来，她转过身来。注意到他阴沉的表情，她的脸也沉了下来，露出了阴郁的怒容。

"Oh god... what now?" "天哪... 又怎么了？"

After he quickly explained, he could have sworn the classroom had literally exploded with her fury.  
在他迅速解释之后，他几乎可以发誓教室里她的愤怒简直像爆炸了一样。

---

They had entered the park that was on the way home. Asuka stomped ahead of him, fuming. She was that angry that he could literally feel the burning aura radiating from her. He hadn't felt this scared of her since when they were kids, back when he had been much more shy.  
他们走进了回家路上的那个公园。明日香怒气冲冲地在他前面跺着脚走，她的愤怒如此强烈，以至于他都能感受到从她身上散发出的炽热气场。自从他们还是孩子，那时他更加害羞以来，他从未如此害怕过她。

"Asuka..." He gently tried to talk to her, but his response was a dangerous sounding growl. His shoulders slumped as he mumbled towards her back.  
"明日香..." 他轻声试图与她交谈，却只得到一声危险的低吼。他垂下肩膀，对着她的背影喃喃自语。

"I'm sorry..." "对不起..."

Time froze. Along with Asuka's footsteps, and the world around them seemed to quieten. It sounded like a normal thing to say, but Asuka's response was a small sob. It was the most heartbreaking sound he could have heard from her. The invincible Asuka, the girl who never backed down. The girl that every single male at their school was attracted to, yet equally terrified of, was quietly sobbing in front of him.  
时间仿佛凝固了。随着明日香的脚步，周围的世界似乎也安静下来。这句话听起来很平常，但明日香的回应却是一声轻微的啜泣。这是他最不愿从她口中听到的声音。那个无所不能的明日香，那个从不退缩的女孩。学校里每一个男生都为之倾倒，却又同样畏惧的女孩，正默默地在他面前啜泣。

"Wha- Asuka!?" He rushed up to her side, and caught a glimpse of her face. Crystal tears swept down her face as she stood there, trying to no avail to rub her eyes, attempting to stem the flow.  
"什- 明日香！？" 他急忙冲到她身边，瞥见了她的脸。晶莹的泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她站在那里，徒劳地试图揉搓眼睛，试图止住泪水的流淌。

"Shinji... stop, don't... don't look at me..."  
"真嗣... 停下，不要... 别看着我..."

"Why are you crying Asuka? I'm sorry! If its something I said, I'm sorry!" He hadn't apologized to her like this since they were kids. Back then, she had yelled at him for apologizing all the time, threatening to punch him in the face if he kept on at it. He tried to curb his use of apologies since then, but he couldn't help it. Not when his best friend in the world, the girl who had stood by him through all hell, was crying his eyes out in front of him.  
“为什么你在哭，明日香？对不起！如果是因为我说了什么，我道歉！” 自从他们还是孩子以来，他就没有这样向她道过歉。那时，她曾因为他总是道歉而对他大吼大叫，威胁说如果他再这样下去就要揍他一顿。从那以后，他试图克制自己的道歉，但此刻他无法控制。毕竟，眼前这位世界上最好的朋友，那个无论多么艰难都一直陪伴在他身边的女孩，正泪流满面地站在他面前。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"She's... she's going to take you away from me!" She was talking about what had happened with Rei. "I've known you since god knows when, yet she swoops in out of nowhere, flashes her rings as though she's showing the world your shackles and... and... GRRAAHHH!" Screams echoed around the park as Asuka yelled towards the heavens, as though she was cursing the gods themselves.  
“她……她要把你从我身边夺走！” 她指的是与绫波发生的事情。“天知道我认识你多久了，她却突然出现，炫耀她的戒指，仿佛在向全世界展示你的枷锁……然后……然后……啊啊啊啊！” 明日香对着天空大喊，仿佛在诅咒众神，公园里回荡着她的尖叫声。

"No!" After breathing heavily for a few moments, she clenched her fists and whirled to face Shinji head-on. Her eyelashes sparkled with moisture as she glared at him. Her gaze was so fierce, he took a step back, cowering slightly.  
“不！”她喘息片刻后，紧握双拳，猛地转身直面真嗣。她的睫毛因湿润而闪烁，目光如炬地瞪着他。那眼神如此凌厉，他不由得后退一步，略显畏缩。

"I'm... sorry" His voice trembled. Realizing that she was probably frightening him, she rolled her eyes and walked over to him.  
"我... 对不起" 他的声音颤抖着。意识到自己可能吓到他了，她翻了个白眼，走过去靠近他。

"I'm not letting her do as she pleases." Asuka looked away, embarrassed as she mumbled. "But with this, I hope you finally understand how I feel. I was hoping for a more romantic confession, but these things are never easy when you're involved."  
"我不会让她随心所欲的。" 明日香别开视线，尴尬地低声说，"但通过这个，我希望你终于能理解我的感受。我本期待一个更浪漫的告白，但只要有你在，这些事从来都不简单。"

It was his turn to feel embarrassed. Looking at his shoes, he suddenly felt an unexplained sense of guilt.  
轮到他感到尴尬了。盯着鞋子的他，突然涌上一股莫名的愧疚感。

"I'm sorry..." "对不起..."

"Argh..." Asuka rolled her eyes again. "If you apologize to me one more time, I'm going to kiss you. And for every time you do it afterwards, I'm going to kiss you again. I don't care if we're in public, at school, or whatever, but I am sick of you saying sorry every five minutes. If this is the only way to shut up your incessant apologies, save using a ball gag, dammit I'll do it!" Asuka's beautiful, cerulean eyes dared him to argue. He was swept away by his pounding heart, and before his brain had any sort of chance to recover, his mouth began moving on its own.  
"啊..." 明日香又翻了个白眼。"如果你再向我道歉一次，我就会吻你。而且每次你这么做之后，我都会再吻你一次。我不在乎我们是在公共场合、在学校还是其他什么地方，但我已经受够了你每隔五分钟就说一次对不起。如果这是唯一能让你停止无休止道歉的方法，除了用口球，该死的我会这么做！" 明日香那双美丽的蔚蓝色眼睛挑衅地看着他。他的心跳如鼓，还没等大脑反应过来，嘴巴已经不由自主地动了起来。

"I'm... sorry?" Meant more as a question to her confounding statement than anything else, he clapped his hand over his mouth. But the damage had already been done.  
"我... 对不起？" 这话更多是对她那令人费解的声明的疑问，而不是别的什么，他赶紧用手捂住嘴。但伤害已经造成了。

Asuka's eyes widened in shock. But it was quickly replaced by a mischievous grin.  
明日香的双眼因震惊而睁大，但很快就被一个调皮的笑容所取代。

"That... was on purpose, wasn't it?"  
“那……是故意的，对吧？”

All he could do was open and close his mouth, gaping like a fish. He felt like his doom was imminent. To whatever gods would listen to his prayer, he wished that he would survive to at least be able to eat some katsu curry, one last time.  
他只能张嘴闭嘴，像条鱼一样呆呆地瞪着。他感觉自己的末日即将来临。向任何愿意聆听他祈祷的神明，他祈愿至少能活到再吃一次炸猪排咖喱饭，哪怕就这一次。

Asuka began to close in slowly, standing on her tiptoes, her grin getting wider and wider as the tip of her nose brushed against the tip of his own. Her arms wrapped around his neck as her face flared with a crimson blush. A fiery determination exploded in her eyes, in which Shinji was now throughly lost in. "Just this once... I'll let it slide." She whispered, her eyes never once leaving his own. One of her hands began to ruffle with his hair as she continued to whisper.  
明日香开始缓缓逼近，踮起脚尖，随着她的鼻尖轻触他的，她的笑容愈发灿烂。她的双臂环抱住他的脖颈，脸上泛起绯红。眼中燃起炽热的决心，此刻的 Shinji 完全迷失其中。“就这一次...我放过你。”她低语，目光始终未曾离开他的双眼。她的一只手开始拨弄他的头发，继续轻声细语。

"Ich liebe dich... dumm Shinji." And with that, her gentle lips pressed against his own, knocking out all of his senses, save for the touch of her lips and the sense of utter euphoria as they stood in the streetlit park, embracing each other to the sound of the chirping cicadas.  
"我爱你...傻真嗣。" 随着这句话，她温柔的唇瓣贴上了他的，剥夺了他所有的感官，只留下唇间的触感和站在街灯下公园里相拥时的极度喜悦，周围是蝉鸣的伴奏。

### Chapter 4: Shinji has a thing for Summoners!  
第四章：真嗣对召唤师情有独钟！  

At some point on the way home, it had started raining. Prepared as usual, Shinji fished out the compact umbrella from his bag. As soon as he had the thing unfolded, Asuka had her arm around his waist, her gaze determinedly looking the other way, for fear of her fire-red face glowing like a beacon in the night being discovered.  
在回家的路上，不知何时开始下起了雨。像往常一样准备周到的真嗣从包里掏出了那把小巧的雨伞。他刚把伞撑开，明日香就挽住了他的腰，目光坚决地望向别处，生怕她那火红的脸颊在夜晚像灯塔一样被人发现。

"Say one embarrassing word or anything and I'll be explaining to Misato why you suddenly have hundreds of bruises." She tried to sound as defensive as possible, but Shinji simply chuckled, beginning the wet but cozy walk home.  
“敢说一句让人尴尬的话或者别的什么，我就会向美里解释为什么你突然浑身是伤。”她试图尽可能地显得防御性强，但真嗣只是轻笑一声，开始了那段湿漉漉但温馨的回家路。

After a few minutes, she had begun to regret her fierce words. Looking at Shinji's arm dangling, she began to wish one of them was wrapped around her shoulders. She leaned in a little closer, attempting to nudge her intentions into him, but his usual obliviousness was preventing her 'Hold me!' signals from reaching his brain.  
几分钟后，她开始后悔自己那番激烈的话语。看着真嗣悬空的手臂，她开始希望其中一只能环抱在她的肩上。她稍稍靠得更近，试图用身体语言向他传达“抱紧我！”的意图，但他的迟钝一如既往，让她发出的信号无法抵达他的大脑。

'I'm beginning to wonder who's the bigger moron...' She thought as she intentionally knocked her hand against his.  
“我开始怀疑谁才是更大的傻瓜...”她心想，故意用手碰了碰他。

Shinji, on the other hand, was facing a dilemma. Her words could be taken seriously, knowing how Asuka used to be in the past. But this new, forward Asuka was a somewhat new creature to him. He had no idea how to react.  
另一方面，真嗣正面临一个难题。考虑到明日香过去的性格，她的言辞可能是认真的。但这个新的、主动的明日香对他来说有些陌生。他完全不知道该如何应对。

A while ago, Hikari had told him something very important.  
不久前，光曾告诉他一件非常重要的事。

"For us girls, and especially a girl like Asuka, who's never really honest about her feelings, never listen to what they're saying. Try to listen to the real words underneath, what they're actually trying to say."  
“对我们女孩来说，尤其是像明日香这样从不真正坦露心声的女孩，别听她们说什么，试着去听她们真正想表达的那些话。”

He'd read enough manga to know that going straight in with that advice was practically suicide. Because it was Asuka, touching her carelessly would result in the offending limb being torn off.  
他读过足够多的漫画，知道直接采纳这个建议几乎等同于自杀。因为那是明日香，鲁莽地触碰她会导致肢体被撕裂。

But if she was already touching him, with her arm wrapped around his waist, holding tight as though to suck all his body warmth from the point of contact, what were the rules then?  
但如果她已经触碰着他，手臂环绕在他的腰间，紧紧抱着仿佛要从接触点吸取他所有的体温，那么规则又是什么呢？

With his umbrella in his right hand, he slowly sneaked his hand around to her shoulder, trembling just above it. The ever perceptive Asuka instantly knew what was going on. Her heartbeat sky-rocketed, not quite believing the normally shy Shinji would try something so daring. With baited breath, she watched him out of the corner of her eye. If she said anything, that fragile courage would be shattered. For the first time in a long time, she had to summon every ounce of patience she could muster.  
他右手撑着伞，慢慢地将手绕到她的肩膀上，手指颤抖着悬停其上。一向敏锐的明日香立刻明白了他的意图。她的心跳加速，几乎不敢相信平时害羞的真嗣会尝试如此大胆的举动。屏住呼吸，她用眼角余光注视着他。如果她开口说些什么，那脆弱的勇气就会破碎。久违地，她必须调动起所有的耐心。

After what seemed like a monumental struggle, she felt his soft touch as he clasped her shoulder gently. A warm smile enveloped her face as she leaned her head into him.  
经过一番似乎是巨大的挣扎后，她感受到了他轻柔的触碰，他温柔地握住了她的肩膀。她脸上绽放出温暖的微笑，将头靠向了他。

"I'm not that scary, am I?"  
"我没那么吓人，对吧？"

Shinji grinned as he held her tighter.  
真嗣笑着将她抱得更紧。

"Not anymore." "现在不吓人了。"

Standing outside the Katsuragi residence, the time had come for them to finally let go. Reluctantly, the two separated and rode the elevator to their floor. Suddenly, they were standing outside their front door.  
站在葛城家的门外，终于到了他们不得不放手的时候。依依不舍地，两人分开并乘坐电梯回到了各自的楼层。突然间，他们就站在了自己的家门口。

Taking a deep breath, Asuka gathered her thoughts. Starting today, she was living with Rei Ayanami. She was living with a potential rival in love. She had to be prepared for anything.  
深吸一口气，明日香整理思绪。从今天起，她将与绫波零同住一个屋檐下。她将与一个潜在的情敌共处一室。她必须做好万全准备。

As she opened her eyes, the front door had begun sliding open. In a heartbeat, a slim, pale white arm had reached out and dragged Shinji inside, screaming. The door slammed shut, audibly locking.  
当她睁开眼睛时，前门已经开始滑动打开。转眼间，一只纤细苍白的手臂伸了出来，将真嗣拖进门内，尖叫声随之响起。门砰然关闭，清晰地锁上了。

Asuka took another deep breath, this time attempting to quell the volcano of rage broiling inside her. A quick analysis of the situation told her one thing. Her romantic interest was now locked in a house with a prospective fiancée, who according to the various noises, was probably molesting him. The volcano erupted as she rammed the door with all her might, attempting to break it down. But as strong as her rage was, she wasn't quite physically strong enough to break down the door.  
明日香又深吸了一口气，这次试图平息内心翻腾的怒火。对局势的快速分析告诉她一件事。她心仪的人现在与一位潜在的未婚妻锁在屋内，根据各种声响，对方很可能正在侵犯他。怒火如火山爆发般喷涌而出，她用尽全力撞向门，试图将其撞开。尽管她的愤怒如此强烈，但她的身体力量却不足以破门而入。

"Open this fucking door Ayanami!"  
“绫波，给我他妈的开门！”

Her response was more of Shinji's wailing, serving to fuel her rage even further. She punched the door, kicked it, shoulder-barged it and screamed at it. Resting her head against its metal frame, she began thinking frantically.  
回应她的是真嗣更加凄厉的哭喊，这进一步点燃了她的怒火。她拳打脚踢，用肩膀猛撞，对着门尖叫。将头靠在金属门框上，她开始疯狂地思考对策。

"Come on genius. How can we get in there?!" More sounds of struggling could be heard and Shinji's startled voice echoed from what sounded like the middle room.  
“快点，天才。我们怎么进去？！”更多的挣扎声传来，真嗣惊慌的声音从听起来像是中间的房间里回荡。

"Rei?! That's my belt, put it back!"  
“绫波？！那是我的腰带，放回去！”

Asuka's eyes sparkled with reignited fury, a million degrees hotter than before. Her only thought was saving Shinji as she brought her fist up again, preparing to hit the door as hard as she could.  
明日香的眼睛闪烁着重新燃起的怒火，比之前还要炽热千万度。她唯一的念头就是救出真嗣，于是再次举起拳头，准备尽全力猛击门。

"GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY SHINJI!" The bracelet sparkled a furious red, as bright as her fury. Her fist connected with the door. Unnoticed in her rage, her arm had covered itself with a bright red metallic armour, which she used to smash the door off the frame of the wall. Debris and dust exploded everywhere. When the dust settled, a terrifying image of Asuka faded into view.  
“放开我的真嗣！”手镯闪烁着愤怒的红色，如同她心中的怒火一般炽烈。她的拳头击中了门。在她狂怒之中，未被察觉的是，她的手臂已经覆盖上了一层鲜红的金属盔甲，她用它将门从墙框中砸飞。碎片和尘埃四处飞溅。尘埃落定后，一个令人恐惧的明日香的身影逐渐显现。

On the floor of the living room, a petrified looking Shinji was caught underneath Rei, who was in the middle of removing his shirt.  
在客厅的地板上，一脸惊恐的真嗣被丽压在身下，她正在脱他的衬衫。

"Katsuragi-sensei will not be too happy with that."  
“葛城老师不会对此太高兴的。”

"I don't give a flying fuck about the damn door right now." Asuka snarled. Rei looked back with an emotionless stare, and finally let go of Shinji, who looked close to passing out.  
"我现在根本不在乎那该死的门。" 明日香咆哮道。绫波回头，用毫无感情的目光看着她，最终放开了快晕过去的真嗣。

"So it appears the experiment was a success." Her eyes glanced towards Asuka's arm, still covered in the almost feral armour. Following her eyes, Asuka too noticed the strange development with her arm, and her anger was suddenly replaced with surprise and curiosity.  
"看来实验成功了。" 她的目光瞥向明日香仍覆盖着近乎野性盔甲的手臂。顺着她的视线，明日香也注意到了自己手臂的奇怪变化，愤怒突然被惊讶和好奇所取代。

"Wait, what? What is this thing?!"  
“等等，什么？这是什么东西？！”

"Moreover, it's just like you to conjure something so beastly in appearance." Rei said as she held out her own arm. A similar looking bracelet to the ones Shinji and Asuka wore adorned her arm, except it was a perfect white colour. Closing her eyes, Rei went silent. After a moment, a similar armour appeared on her arm, in similar fashion to Asuka's. It looked a lot less scary than Asuka's arm, with a more elegant touch to its appearance.  
"再者，你能召唤出如此狰狞之物，倒也符合你的风格。" 丽说着伸出自己的手臂。她的手腕上戴着与真嗣和明日香相似的手镯，只是颜色纯白无瑕。闭上眼睛，丽静默片刻。随即，她的手臂上也浮现出类似的装甲，与明日香的装甲形成方式相似。不过，她的装甲看起来远不如明日香的那样吓人，外观上更显优雅。

"And what are you going to do with that?" Bringing her own weaponised arm into a fighting stance, Asuka prepared, come whatever madness may. Rei completely ignored her however, and turned towards Shinji.  
"你打算用那东西做什么？" 明日香将自己的武器化手臂摆出战斗姿态，准备迎接任何疯狂的挑战。然而，丽完全无视了她，转向真嗣。

"My ones prettier, don't you think?"  
"我的更漂亮，你不觉得吗？"

Shinji could only look between the two girls, dumbfounded. Was it a serious question? Was there going to be repurcussions if he said he did indeed think Rei's arm-armour thing was a little less scary than Asuka's? Probably, but he was thankfully saved from asking by the sound of a heavy six-pack of Yebisu dropping to the ground. The owner of the beer was currently looking at her front door, aghast.  
真嗣只能呆呆地看着两位女孩，不知所措。这是个严肃的问题吗？如果他承认确实觉得绫波的臂甲比明日香的要稍微不那么吓人，会有什么后果吗？很可能会有，但幸运的是，一阵沉重的六罐装惠比寿啤酒落地声救了他。啤酒的主人此刻正惊愕地盯着自家前门。

"Does someone want to explain what happened here?" Misato eyed the three students, as well as the peculiar weapons attached to the girl's arms.  
“有人能解释一下这里发生了什么吗？”美里打量着这三名学生，以及那个女孩手臂上奇特的武器。

"We were just...-" Her excuses tumbled over each other inside her mouth, but before Asuka could get a decent word out, Rei spoke up.  
"我们只是...-" 她的借口在嘴里争先恐后地涌出，但还没等明日香能说出一句完整的话，绫波便开口了。

"I was instructed by Yui Ikari to perform an experiment involving the bracelets. And before anything else, I believe it's my duty to clean up the mess of my... Subjects." Something like a smile curled across Rei's lips as she reformed her armour back into a bracelet. Holding her arm out again, she closed her eyes. Sparks and mystical lights began to flow around the room as the debris from the earlier incident began to lift and return to the wall. It was like watching an explosion happening in reverse.  
"我受碇唯的指示，进行了一项关于手镯的实验。而在此之前，我认为我有责任清理我...实验对象造成的混乱。" 绫波的嘴角勾起一丝类似微笑的表情，随后将她的装甲重新变回手镯。她再次伸出胳膊，闭上眼睛。火花和神秘的光芒开始在房间内流动，之前事故产生的碎片开始升起并回归到墙面上。这就像是在观看一场反向的爆炸。

Asuka watched the spectacle relieved that her outburst hadn't caused any permanent damage, but couldn't help feel a little antagonistic towards Rei. The girl had been playing them both the second they'd returned home. How was she expected to live with a girl who was clearly going to mess with her head.  
明日香看着这一幕，松了一口气，庆幸自己的爆发没有造成永久性损害，但忍不住对绫波产生了一丝敌意。从他们回家的那一刻起，这个女孩就在玩弄他们俩。她怎么能指望和一个显然会扰乱她思绪的女孩共处一室。

"An experiment?" Shinji suddenly remembered how to use his voice. "Are you going to show us how to actually use this things? And wait, how are you involved with my parents?"  
"一个实验？" 真嗣突然记起如何使用自己的声音。"你要教我们如何实际使用这些东西吗？等等，你和我父母有什么关系？"

"Actually, I can answer that one." After placing her slightly dented beers in the refrigerator, taking one out for herself, she sat down on the sofa.  
"实际上，我可以回答这个问题。" 她将稍稍凹陷的啤酒放入冰箱，取出一罐给自己，然后坐在沙发上。"

"Was it about a week ago? Something like that-" One quick swig of beer and then she continued. "So about a week ago, Yui came up to me and said, 'Misato', in that voice that tells me she's going to ask for something huge. Anyway, 'Misato, would you be able to do me a huge favour, and take care of one of my distant relatives for a while?'. Of course, along with Kyoko, we're sort of all in this together, so I can't exactly refuse her."  
"大约一周前？差不多那样——" 她迅速喝了一口啤酒，然后继续说道。"所以大约一周前，Yui 来找我，用那种让我知道她要提出大请求的语气说，'Misato'。总之，'Misato，你能帮我一个大忙，暂时照顾一下我的一个远房亲戚吗？'。当然，和 Kyoko 一起，我们算是共同承担这一切，所以我不能拒绝她。"

At the mention of her mother, Asuka perked up. It wasn't often she got to hear of her ever-busy parent, but as much as she would never admit it, she was a mommy's girl and wanted to spend more time with her. As a result of this deity-creating experiment, the Ikari's and her mother had spent so much time locked in their labs that she was begin to seriously worry about her mothers health. She was never really the type to take care of herself, and seemed to be constantly bumping into things. For all she knew, her ditzy mother probably forgot how to sleep.  
一提到母亲，明日香顿时来了精神。她很少有机会听到这位总是忙碌的家长的消息，尽管她绝不会承认，但她确实是个离不开妈妈的孩子，渴望与母亲共度更多时光。由于这项创造神明的实验，碇家和她的母亲长时间被困在实验室里，这让明日香开始严重担忧母亲的健康。母亲向来不擅长照顾自己，总是磕磕碰碰的。在明日香看来，她那迷糊的母亲可能连睡觉都忘了怎么睡。

"Wait, we're related?" Shinji asked curiously. He had met Rei as a child, and they had played together a lot as children, but leaving talks of marriage aside, this was the first he had heard of a blood relation. He'd always assumed her parents were business partners to his parents or something.  
“等等，我们是亲戚？” 真嗣好奇地问道。他小时候就认识丽，两人童年时经常一起玩耍，但抛开婚姻话题不谈，这是他第一次听说有血缘关系。他一直以为她的父母和自己的父母是生意伙伴之类的关系。

"Even I'm not really sure of the relationship, but something like very distant cousins?" Rei sounded just as curious as he was. Misato grinned at the pair of them.  
"连我自己也不太确定这关系，但大概是远得不能再远的远房表亲吧？" 丽的声音里同样充满了好奇。美里对着他们俩咧嘴一笑。

"Nothing to worry about, a marriage between the two of you would be perfectly okay. Well, apart from the childhood friend having her say." She knocked back her head and laughed, downing the rest of her beer.  
“没什么好担心的，你们俩结婚完全没问题。不过嘛，青梅竹马总得发表点意见。”她仰头大笑，一口气喝完了剩下的啤酒。

"Which isn't happening by the way." Asuka growled. Her lack of a say in this marriage arrangement was infuriating, but she'd be damned if she was going to let any of it go ahead.  
"反正这事儿没戏。" 明日香咆哮道。她在这桩婚事中毫无发言权，这让她怒不可遏，但她绝不会让这一切继续下去。

"Are we declaring war?" Misato teased. The Asuka she knew was stubborn and wasn't about to place herself into a situation that may potentially embarrass her. But her jaw hung itself open as she watched the spirited yet flushed redhead link arms with Shinji, who looked close to having his own personal meltdown, and force herself to present a victorious grin.  
"我们这是要宣战吗？" 美里打趣道。她认识的明日香固执得很，绝不会让自己陷入可能尴尬的境地。但当她看到那位精神抖擞却满脸通红的红发少女挽着真嗣的胳膊，强迫自己露出胜利的微笑时，她的下巴几乎要掉下来了。真嗣看起来快要崩溃了。

"If she's come to challenge my territory that I've had claimed for over ten years, she can forget it." She looked up to the boy she had known her entire life, his eyes as wide as peaches.  
"如果她是来挑战我十多年来一直占据的领地，那她还是趁早死心吧。" 她抬头看向那个她从小到大一直认识的男孩，他的眼睛瞪得像桃子一样大。

"He's mine." “他是我的。”

In a flash, Rei was hanging off his other arm, glaring at her competition. Stuck in the middle, Shinji suddenly thought of all the things he still had to do in life. With the way things were going, he was never going to get laid before Asuka killed him. He had been thinking of trying his hand at becoming a mangaka, but his characters and ideas were tearfully waving goodbye to him as the grim reaper came to introduce himself. He should've wrote a will at some point...  
转眼间，丽已经挂在他的另一只手臂上，瞪着她的竞争对手。被困在中间的 Shinji 突然想起了生活中还有许多事情要做。照这样下去，他还没来得及和 Asuka 发生关系就会被她杀掉。他曾考虑过尝试成为一名漫画家，但他的角色和创意正泪流满面地向他挥手告别，死神则前来自我介绍。他本该在某一刻写下遗嘱的……

"This little drama is great to watch and all, definitely beats anything on TV these days, but can we pause this and resume that conversation about 'experiments' and freaky bracelets?" The rarely seen responsible Misato made her appearance, with the best intentions.  
“这场小闹剧真是好看，绝对比现在的电视节目强多了，但我们能不能暂停一下，继续谈谈关于‘实验’和那些奇怪的手环的话题？”难得一见的负责任的 Misato 出现了，带着最好的意图。

But Rei had other ideas.  
但丽有别的打算。

"This might be a good idea to show what I've learned."  
"这或许是个展示我所学的好机会。"

Her bracelet glowed once more. A length of thin, sturdy rope was conjured out of thin air. It rapidly wrapped itself around Shinji, pinning his arms to his side. Another rope did the same to Asuka, although her arms were restrained behind her, preventing her from moving.  
她的手镯再次发光。一条细长而结实的绳索凭空出现，迅速缠绕住真嗣，将他的双臂紧贴身体束缚住。另一条绳索同样缠住了明日香，但她的手臂被反绑在背后，使她无法动弹。

"If you can't use the weapons available, you won't be able to win this battle." Rei said, a victorious smile playing across her face.  
""如果你不能利用现有的武器，你就无法赢得这场战斗。"" 丽说道，脸上浮现出一丝胜利的微笑。

"I'm too young for BDSM, can't we just talk about this Rei?!" Shinji wailed in the middle. Asuka was struggling against the rope digging into her arms, infuriated from the brazenness shown by the red-eyed man-thief. She was still surprised at how real the ropes felt, for something that was essentially created from nothing.  
"我还没到能接受 BDSM 的年纪啊，就不能和丽好好谈谈吗？！" 真嗣在中间哀嚎道。明日香挣扎着，绳子勒进她的手臂，对那个红眼男贼的厚颜无耻感到愤怒。她仍然惊讶于这些绳索的真实感，毕竟它们本质上是从无到有创造出来的。

"I thought the whole reason you were here was to show us how to use these damn bracelets?!" Her mind raced as she tried to remember how the technology worked.  
“我以为你来这儿的目的就是教我们怎么用这些该死的手环？！”她的大脑飞速运转，试图回忆这项技术是如何运作的。

Breaking down the door, she had wanted something strong, something that could compensate for her lack of strength. It didn't even matter what shape, but it morphed into a powerful arm. Her subconscious might've filled in the blanks, but she essentially imagined something strong. Just like in the room in the lab, Shinji had to imagine the cat into existence. With that in mind...  
她破门而入时，渴望得到某种强大的力量，以弥补自身的不足。形状并不重要，但它最终化作了一条强有力的手臂。或许是潜意识填补了空白，但她本质上想象的是某种强大的东西。正如在实验室的那个房间里，真嗣不得不将猫想象成现实一样。想到这里……

"Heh..." An evil grin played on her face.  
“嘿嘿……”她的脸上浮现出一抹邪恶的笑容。

"I don't like that face your making Asuka... " Shinji knew her various expressions well enough by now to know that her counterattack was imminent and would somehow be painful for him.  
“我不喜欢你现在的表情，明日香……”真嗣已经很熟悉她的各种表情，知道她的反击即将到来，而且肯定会让他痛苦不堪。

"It appears you weren't necessary after all Ayanami." Straining her muscles, stretching the rope, and eventually the rope restraining Asuka came free. Part of the rope tying her hands had been charred black as she had burned through them by imagining flame surrounding her hands. The power even ensured she hadn't felt the burn of the flame either.  
"看来你终究不是必需的，绫波。" 她用力绷紧肌肉，拉扯着绳索，最终束缚着明日香的绳子松脱了。绑住她双手的部分绳索已被烧得焦黑，因为她想象着火焰环绕双手，竟真的将其烧断了。这股力量甚至让她连火焰的灼烧感都未曾感受到。

"You just need an open mind."  
"你只需要一个开放的心态。"

"Oh I see!" It looked like Shinji had come to the same conclusion. Closing his eyes, he imagined a flame burning the ropes at the contact point of his body. Within seconds, and accompanied by a whooshing flame sound, the ropes fell to his feet, severed and charred.  
"哦，我明白了！" 看起来真嗣得出了同样的结论。他闭上眼睛，想象着一团火焰在身体与绳索接触点燃烧。几秒钟内，伴随着呼啸的火焰声，绳索断开并烧焦，掉落在他的脚边。

"Ow!" He'd apparently forgotten that fire burns though, neglecting to protect himself as Asuka had done.  
"哎哟！" 他显然忘记了火会烧伤，没有像明日香那样保护自己。

"Instead of explaining everything, it's easier to show you. And it will be easier to remember in the future too." Rei made no move to suggest any further antagonistic moves would follow.  
"与其解释一切，不如直接展示给你看。这样将来也更容易记住。" 丽没有做出任何暗示会有进一步敌对行动的举动。

"Teaching like a normal person isn't bad once in a while though."  
"偶尔像普通人那样教学也不错。"

"I agree with him. You better not become a schoolteacher someday, you might end up killing someone." Asuka sighed. But now she knew how the bracelet worked, she wanted to try something out. Holding out her hand, she closed her eyes and began to exercise her imagination.  
我同意他的看法。你最好别当老师，哪天说不定真会闹出人命。明日香叹了口气。但现在她已经明白了手环的运作原理，便想亲自试试。她伸出手，闭上双眼，开始运用自己的想象力。

Within a few moments, a bottle of Ramane appeared.  
没过一会儿，一瓶拉玛内酒就出现了。

"Oh sweet, things like this can be summoned too!" She popped off the top and began to drink. It tasted the same as any other she had drunk in the past.  
“哦，太好了，这种东西也能召唤出来！”她打开瓶盖开始喝了起来。味道和她以前喝过的任何一种都一样。

"Does that count as stealing?" Shinji looked sheepishly at her as she finished the whole bottle off.  
"那算不算偷窃呢？" 真嗣有些尴尬地看着她，她已经把整瓶酒喝完了。

"Does this mean I never have to buy beer anymore?!" Misato jumped up excitedly. She sat down despondently when Rei began to shake her head.  
"这是不是意味着我以后再也不用买啤酒了？！" 美里兴奋地跳了起来。当丽开始摇头时，她又沮丧地坐了下来。

"There's still a lot we don't know yet, but because beer is something we haven't tried yet, we wouldn't be able to summon something we don't know the taste of. There's no record of it in our subconscious memory."  
"我们还有很多未知的东西，但因为啤酒是我们还没尝试过的，我们无法召唤出我们不知道味道的东西。在我们的潜意识记忆中没有它的记录。"

"Asuka, I'm willing to turn a blind eye as a teacher and a legal guardian this once, you can have one of my Yebisu, so please-..." Misato stopped short when she noticed Asuka was already holding a can of Yebisu. There was no trace of guilt in her face, not in the slightest. If anything, a sly smile was shining through.  
"明日香，作为老师和法定监护人，我这次可以睁一只眼闭一只眼，你可以拿一罐我的惠比寿啤酒，所以请——..."美里话说到一半突然停住，因为她注意到明日香手里已经拿着一罐惠比寿。她的脸上没有丝毫的愧疚，反而露出了一丝狡黠的笑容。

"Asuka, we're minors..." Shinji sighed again. He felt like he'd be doing it a lot more in the future to come.  
"明日香，我们还是未成年人..."真嗣再次叹了口气。他感觉未来这样的叹息会越来越多。

"Try telling that to my mom. She takes a very German approach to these things." Asuka chuckled as she threw the beer to Misato.  
"你跟我妈说去吧。她对这些事情采取的是非常德国式的态度。"明日香笑着把啤酒扔给了美里。

"It's even got the right temperature! It's ice cold!" Instantly popping the tab, Misato's grin looked ready to jump off her face. "Don't mind if I do!"  
“温度也刚刚好！冰凉冰凉的！”美里立刻拉开拉环，笑容仿佛要从脸上蹦出来。“那我就不客气了！”

"You're not going to even try to correct all the wrong in this situation?" Shinji mumbled as he watched Misato down the beer in one go.  
“你甚至不打算尝试纠正这种情况中的所有错误吗？”真嗣咕哝着，看着美里一口气喝完啤酒。

"Why? If I do that, I might stop getting free beer! And nothing in life tastes better than free beer!"  
"为什么？如果我那样做，我可能就喝不到免费啤酒了！生活中没有什么比免费啤酒更美味的了！"

Shaking his head, Shinji thought to his own bracelet. If it worked by exercising his imagination, he wanted to try it with something that didn't exist in the real world. Holding out his hand, he mimicked Asuka's earlier actions and closed his eyes. He focuses hard, and within seconds, felt a heavy object in his hand.  
摇了摇头，真嗣想到了自己的手环。如果它是通过发挥想象力来运作的，他想尝试一下现实中不存在的东西。他伸出手，模仿明日香之前的动作，闭上眼睛。他集中精神，几秒钟内，就感觉到手中有一个沉重的物体。

"Someone's been playing too much Final Fantasy lately."  
"最近有人玩太多《最终幻想》了。"

An oddly shaped watery-blue sword was in his hands. It looked identical to the one he had been using in the game he had been playing with Asuka a few days before they had gone to the lab.  
他手中握着一把形状奇特的水蓝色长剑。它看起来与他几天前和明日香一起玩游戏时所用的那把一模一样，就在他们去实验室之前。

"You were playing it with me!"  
"你刚才是在和我一起玩！"

"That's true." In Asuka's hands was a long staff with a blue handle, with a golden head that incorporated an interesting design. "Woah... If I did any cosplay, this would save so much money on the outfits!"  
"确实如此。" 在明日香手中的是一根长杖，蓝色手柄，金色头部带有独特的设计。"哇...如果我做角色扮演，这能省下不少服装费呢！"

"You have the power of imagination at your disposal and you're using it for... Cosplay?" Rei sounded out her disbelief.  
"你拥有想象的力量，却用它来做...角色扮演？" 丽表达出她的不相信。

"Oh come on! Haven't you ever wanted to be like your favourite character from a story or something? This is awesome!" Asuka glanced at Shinji. "Let's go the whole way!"  
“哎呀，拜托！你难道没想过要像你最喜欢的故事角色那样吗？这太棒了！”明日香瞥了真嗣一眼。“我们全力以赴吧！”

Asuka's whole body was quickly enveloped in red light. After a few moments, she was wearing a kimono-esque outfit, a blue flowing dress with a backless white design covering her top-half. Just like...  
明日香全身迅速被红光笼罩。片刻之后，她换上了一套和服风格的衣服，蓝色飘逸的长裙搭配上半身无袖的白色设计。简直就像……

"Yuna! You look just like her!" Shinji could only stare at the immaculately detailed recreation of his arguably favourite character from the game series. Something that he suspected she had done on purpose.  
“优娜！你看起来和她一模一样！”真嗣只能盯着这个他心目中可以说是游戏系列里最喜欢的角色，如此细致入微的再现。他怀疑这是她故意为之的。

"It appears I'm going to have to start playing more games with you Shinji." Rei smiled at him. Asuka smirked whilst pointing the staff at her.  
“看来我得开始多和你一起玩游戏了，真嗣。”绫波微笑着对他说。明日香则一边得意地笑着，一边用权杖指向她。

"That's right, I know all of Shinji's favourite characters, his likes, dislikes and what buttons to press with him. You're not stealing him away, no matter what you do!"  
“没错，我知道真嗣最喜欢的角色，他的喜好、厌恶以及如何与他相处。无论你做什么，都别想把他从我身边抢走！”

Rei returned the smirk, folding her arms and taking a defiant posture.  
丽回以一丝冷笑，双臂交叉，摆出一副挑衅的姿态。

"We shall see." 「我们拭目以待。」

### Chapter 5: You Can (Not) Run Away  
第五章：你无法逃离  

_I'd advise listening to In the Hall of the Mountain King_ by Grieg _whilst reading the first scene. At least, that's what I was listening to when I wrote it xD_  
我建议在阅读第一幕时听格里格的《山魔王的宫殿》。至少，这是我写作时听的曲子 xD

---

Morning had made itself known, shining blinding rays of light into a tiny sliver of a gap between Shinji's curtains. Through the magic of physics and reflections, that minuscule beam of sunlight had bounced off the metallic parts on his music player, and had somehow found a path straight onto Shinji's closed eyelids. Grimacing in response to the assault on his eyes, he gingerly opened an eye, wondering why his arms felt so heavy.  
清晨已悄然来临，将刺眼的光线射入真嗣窗帘间的一丝缝隙。借助物理学和反射的魔力，那一小束阳光从他的音乐播放器的金属部件上弹开，不知怎的竟直接找到了通往真嗣紧闭眼睑的路径。他因眼睛受到的攻击而皱起眉头，小心翼翼地睁开一只眼，疑惑为何手臂感觉如此沉重。

Never in his entire life had he regretted waking up more than today.  
他一生中从未像今天这样后悔过醒来。

On his left slept a familiar head of bright, dazzling orange. On his right, a cool, yet enticing head of blue. Asuka and Rei were both asleep in his bed, each reserving an arm for a pillow.  
左边躺着一个熟悉的、耀眼的橙色脑袋。右边则是一个冷静而诱人的蓝色脑袋。明日香和绫波零都睡在他的床上，各自枕着他的一条胳膊。

And as if that wasn't enough to give him the shock of a lifetime, the alarm clock close to his bed told him he had about thirty seconds before it was due to go off.  
而似乎这还不足以让他震惊一生，床边的闹钟告诉他，再过三十秒就要响了。

Thirty seconds before complete and utter, absolute hell would undoubtedly tear apart his existence like a hurricane, and make the Armageddon look like a cake walk.  
再过三十秒，绝对的、彻底的地狱无疑会像飓风一样撕裂他的存在，让世界末日看起来都像是在散步。

Actually no, it was twenty seconds now. Twenty seconds before a portal to hell opened in his room.  
实际上不，现在只剩二十秒了。二十秒后，通往地狱的传送门将在他的房间打开。

Needless to say, he had started to sweat buckets. He could fill a decently sized swimming pool with his overdriven anxiety sweat. And all that did was serve to add to his panic, wondering if the two girls would be grossed out.  
不用说，他已经开始大汗淋漓。他的过度焦虑汗水足以填满一个相当大的游泳池。而这只会加剧他的恐慌，担心那两个女孩会不会觉得恶心。

Ten seconds. 十秒钟。

He still never got around to writing that will. And he had never really got started with his bucket list either. At this rate he would never write that perverted manga he had been planning on since way back.  
他还是没来得及写那份遗嘱。而且他的遗愿清单也从未真正开始过。照这样下去，他永远也写不出那部从很久以前就开始策划的色情漫画了。

To begin with, what were they doing in his room? Were their own rooms not good enough? Was his bed comfier than theirs? Why?  
首先，他们为什么会在他的房间里？难道他们自己的房间不够好吗？是他的床比他们的更舒服吗？为什么？

Five seconds. 五秒钟。

"Oh god please no..." “哦天哪，请不要……”

Two seconds. 两秒钟。

"God's not in his heaven, he's gone off somewhere and abandoned me. AGAIN."  
"上帝不在他的天堂，他又跑到哪儿去了，又一次抛弃了我。"

One second. 稍等一下。

"AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH..."  
"啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊..."

As he mentally screamed his way into denial, the inevitable dindindindin of his alarm clock began to beep, and he felt Asuka nudge on his arm.  
当他内心尖叫着陷入否认时，不可避免的闹钟“叮叮叮叮”声开始响起，他感觉到明日香轻推他的手臂。

"Shinji... Please, five more minutes, come on... Who the hell has their alarm on this early in the morning..."  
“真嗣...拜托，再睡五分钟，行行好...谁会在这么早的早晨设闹钟啊...”

"I agree Ikari. Your alarm is set ridiculously early."  
“我同意，碇。你的闹钟设得也太早了。”

An awkward silence descended upon the room, penetrated by the still beeping alarm clock.  
房间里笼罩着尴尬的沉默，只有仍在嘀嗒作响的闹钟声穿透其中。

"Rei." "丽。"

"Yes, Asuka?" "什么事，明日香？"

"Why are you in Shinji's bed?"  
“你为什么在真嗣的床上？”

"I believe for the same reasons you are also in his bed."  
“我想我和你一样，都是因为同样的原因才在他的床上。”

Another awkward silence. The alarm clock was still beeping. It was doing that thing alarm clocks do, speeding up the beeps, as well as upping its volume.  
又是一阵尴尬的沉默。闹钟还在响个不停。它正做着闹钟常做的事，加快响声的频率，同时提高音量。

But all Shinji could hear was the sound of his own heartbeat, racing a marathon at a deafening pace. He was sure his own nervous system was trying to give itself a heart attack.  
但真嗣只能听到自己心跳的声音，以震耳欲聋的速度跑着马拉松。他确信自己的神经系统正试图给自己一个心脏病发作。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

"I swear, this is not my-..."  
“我发誓，这不是我的……”

"Why did you let that harlot into your bed."  
"你为何让那荡妇上了你的床。"

"...fault." "...过错。"

"I take offence at being called a 'harlot'. Wench."  
"我可不乐意被称作‘荡妇’。泼妇。"

"OH NO YOU DIDN'T!" Asuka leapt out of Shinji's bed, grabbing the screeching alarm clock, then proceeding to throw it as hard as she could towards Rei.  
“你敢！”明日香从真嗣的床上跳起来，抓起那只尖叫的闹钟，用力朝绫波扔去。

Lifting her arm faster than anyone could have seen, Rei's bracelet sparkled with a shimmering light. A shield, or something like a forcefield had bubbled around Shinji and herself. The alarm clock collided with the shield at high speed, exploding into a flurry of plastic shards and silicon chips. The poor thing had never stood a chance.  
绫波手臂一挥，快得无人能看清，她的手镯闪烁着微光。一个盾牌，或者说类似力场的东西在真嗣和她周围形成。闹钟高速撞上力场，瞬间炸成一片塑料碎片和硅芯片。那可怜的小东西根本毫无胜算。

"THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME!" Shinji screamed as he barrelled out of his room, bright lights and explosions following in his wake. His doorframe blew up into a cloud of dust, smoke rushing down the hallways.  
“他们要杀了我！”真嗣尖叫着冲出房间，身后是明亮的灯光和爆炸。他的门框炸成一团尘埃，烟雾沿着走廊蔓延。

"YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED IN HERE!" Asuka bellowed as her bracelet morphed into a katana, of which the blade was on fire.  
“你不能进来这里！”明日香吼道，她的手镯变形为一把武士刀，刀刃上燃烧着火焰。

"And I suppose Ikari gave you permission to sneak into his bed?" Rei's response was met with a sharp blade to the throat, sparks flying off the bubble shield still around her. Summoning her own weapons, Rei had opted for a pair of gauntlets on her arms, equipped with a gun and live ammunition.  
“我猜是碇让你偷偷爬上他的床的？”绫波的回应伴随着一把锋利的刀刃抵在她的喉咙上，火花从她周围依然存在的泡泡护盾上飞溅而出。绫波召唤出自己的武器，选择了一对装有枪和实弹的手套。

Asuka had thrown up her own shield, and the bullets were ricocheting around the apartment. Several of which buried themselves into the walls around Shinji, who had remembered just in time how to use his own bracelet, allowing him to generate his own shield. He looked just about ready to wet himself, cowering in fear on the floor as he stared at the war going on in the living room.  
明日香也举起了自己的护盾，子弹在公寓内四处弹射。其中几颗嵌入了真嗣周围的墙壁，他及时想起了如何使用自己的手镯，生成了自己的护盾。他看起来几乎要吓尿了，蜷缩在地上，惊恐地盯着客厅里正在进行的战斗。

"THAT. IS. ENOUGH." "够了！"

Another explosion rocked the apartment. A rarely seen, royally pissed Misato had jumped into the midst of the girl's fighting, pointing her own weapons at the two battling females. An eloquently designed flintlock pistol and a traditional wakizashi sword that was parrying Asuka's flaming katana, which itself was slowly beginning to fade out of view, along with Rei's gauntlets. Their bracelets had mysteriously decided to power off. Glimmering on Misato's arm was a purple bracelet, matching perfectly with her hair.  
又一声爆炸震撼了公寓。极少见到的、怒气冲天的美里跳进了女孩们的战斗中，用她自己的武器指向两位正在交战的女性。一把设计精美的燧发枪和一把传统的胁差，正抵挡着明日香燃烧的武士刀，那刀本身正慢慢开始消失，连同丽的手套一起。她们的腕带神秘地决定关闭电源。美里手臂上闪烁着一条紫色的腕带，与她的头发完美匹配。

If she hadn't been in her regular vest top and short shorts, Shinji would have felt that she looked incredibly cool right then.  
如果不是她穿着平常的背心和短裤，真嗣会觉得她此刻看起来非常酷。

"W-what happened?" Asuka looked surprised as she checked her bracelet. A holographic message had appeared above it.  
"发-发生了什么？" 明日香惊讶地检查着她的手环。一个全息信息出现在它上方。

Administrator lockout. 管理员锁定。

"Your bracelets are not toys! You both could have easily killed someone!" Misato stood up, glaring at the two girls as she lowered her weapons. It was really weird to see her acting responsible, and for once looking genuinely angry. It was almost scary.  
"你们的手环不是玩具！你们俩本可以轻易杀死某人的！" 美里站起身来，瞪着两个女孩，同时收起了武器。看到她表现得如此负责任，而且这次真的看起来很生气，这几乎有点吓人。

"Wait, why do you have one?" Asuka looked at the similar bracelet Misato now wore on her left arm. Smiling, Misato held it out proudly.  
“等等，你怎么也有一个？”明日香看着美里左臂上与自己相似的手环。美里微笑着，自豪地展示出来。

"Yui gave me one. She needed to make sure that you guys wouldn't mess around and abuse your newfound 'powers', so she made me one with administrative technology so that I can remotely shut down your bracelets if things ever get out of hand." Glancing around the remains of what she once called her home, Misato sighed.  
"优给了我一个。她需要确保你们不会胡闹，滥用新获得的'能力'，所以她用管理技术给我做了一个，这样我就能在情况失控时远程关闭你们的手环。" 米莎托环顾着曾经称之为家的废墟，叹了口气。

"I'd say this pretty much sums up what she was talking about."  
"我想这基本上概括了她所说的内容。"

The girls and Shinji together worked on repairing the damage that had been caused. Together with the bracelets, after Misato had re-enabled them, it wasn't a difficult job. Soon enough the apartment looked spotless. It was as though there had never been a fight at all, save for the trauma Shinji and the majority of their neighbours probably received.  
女孩们和真嗣一起修复了造成的损坏。在美里重新启用手环后，这项工作并不困难。不久，公寓看起来一尘不染。仿佛从未发生过任何战斗，除了真嗣和大多数邻居可能遭受的心理创伤。

"So with that out of the way, I think its time to lay down some house rules with these gadgets." Misato was sat in a chair, a summoned Yebisu cracked open in her hand.  
"既然问题解决了，我想是时候为这些小玩意儿制定一些家规了。" 美里坐在椅子上，手中拿着一瓶召唤来的 Yebisu 啤酒。

"No violence in the house. At all. Yui has given me strict orders that the bracelets cannot be used for settling disputes of any kind with force."  
"家中禁止任何形式的暴力。Yui 严格命令过，这些手环不能用于以武力解决任何争端。"

Misato downed another gulp of her beer before continuing.  
美里又猛灌了一口啤酒，然后继续说道。

"You all wield powers that most would attribute to a deity. You're basically three out-of-control gods at the moment. Think about that for a second, and I hope you'll realise how dangerous this power actually is."  
"你们所掌握的力量，常人会将其归于神明。你们现在基本上就是三个失控的神。稍微想想这一点，我希望你们能意识到这种力量实际上有多危险。"

Asuka, Rei and Shinji all nodded together, all feeling a little ashamed of what had occurred.  
明日香、绫波和真嗣都一起点了点头，对于发生的事情感到有些羞愧。

"The only other rule would be to not abuse the powers in a way that would break the law. Can't have you three becoming phantom thieves with your crazy powers." She laughed as Asuka smirked in response.  
"唯一的另一条规则就是不要滥用能力去做违法的事情。总不能让你们三个用这些疯狂的能力变成幻影盗贼吧。" 她笑着说，而明日香则回应了一个得意的微笑。

"Says the one who's drinking magically summoned beer without paying a dime."  
"说得好像那个喝着魔法召唤出来的啤酒却一毛不拔的人不是你一样。"

"Hey, there's exceptions to every rule, right?"  
"嘿，凡事总有例外，对吧？"

"I'll bet there is." Asuka muttered under her breath. Sitting next to her, Shinji grimaced. That meant more trouble waited for them in the future.  
"我敢打赌是的。" 明日香低声嘟囔。坐在她旁边的真嗣皱了皱眉。这意味着未来还有更多的麻烦在等着他们。

---

Pots and pans could be heard crashing about in the kitchen. He distinctly heard the sound of a plate crashing to the ground violently.  
厨房里传来锅碗瓢盆的碰撞声。他清楚地听到一个盘子猛烈地摔碎在地上的声音。

"Jesus Rei! You're so damn clumsy!"  
“天哪，丽！你真是笨手笨脚！”

"I honestly do believe that was your fault Asuka."  
“老实说，我确实认为是你的错，明日香。”

"I might not be able to use my bracelet, but don't make me slap you with a spatula!"  
"我可能用不了我的手环，但别逼我用平底锅扇你！"

More arguing followed as Shinji prayed that his precious tools would survive the siege. He knew the bracelets could fix just about any damage, but he also believed that the two girls he lived with could easily defy logic and cause an armageddon. Reaching for his music player, he jammed the two earphones in and played some Pachelbel. It was the only way he was going to be able to relax amongst the destruction.  
争吵声此起彼伏，真嗣祈祷着他珍爱的工具能在这场围攻中幸存。他知道手环几乎能修复任何损伤，但他也相信与他同住的两位女孩能轻易地违背逻辑，引发一场末日浩劫。他伸手拿起音乐播放器，塞上两只耳机，播放了一段帕赫贝尔的音乐。这是他在破坏中寻求放松的唯一方式。

For whatever reason possessed them, the girls had decided they wanted to make Shinji breakfast this morning. He had debated endlessly with them why this was not a good idea, and the pair of them had not given him any wiggle room to come up with a decent argument. In the end, not only was he confused as to why he was having breakfast made for him, he was also worried about whether or not he would survive eating the results.  
不知为何，女孩们决定今天早上要为真嗣做早餐。他曾与她们争论为何这不是个好主意，但她们没给他任何回旋的余地来提出一个像样的论点。最终，他不仅困惑于为何有人为他做早餐，还担心自己是否能安然无恙地吃下这些成果。

After an agonising twenty minute wait, he heard a knock on the door, and a somewhat worryingly out of breath Asuka. Her hair was a tousled mess and she looked hot and sweaty.  
经过二十分钟的煎熬等待，他听到了敲门声，随之而来的是有些令人担忧的气喘吁吁的明日香。她的头发凌乱不堪，看起来又热又汗。

"We... are... done. Come, eat... now."  
“我们……做完了。来，吃……现在。”

Glancing over at the clock, Shinji decided against telling her it was way past midday. Breakfast time was well and truly over by now, but he really didn't fancy anymore concussions this week.  
瞥了一眼时钟，真嗣决定不告诉她现在已经过了中午。早餐时间早已过去，但他这周真的不想再有任何脑震荡了。

Gingerly stepping out of his room, he wandered over to where the smell of food was coming from, mentally noting that it at least smelled edible. Making it to the kitchen, which sported several charred scars over the walls, he spotted a plate of omelette, with a generous serving of sausages and bacon on the side. Most of all, it actually looked really good.  
小心翼翼地走出房间，他循着食物的香味走去，心里暗自庆幸至少闻起来还能吃。来到厨房，只见墙上留有几处焦黑的痕迹，他发现了一盘煎蛋卷，旁边还搭配着丰盛的香肠和培根。最重要的是，它看起来真的非常美味。

"She wrestled with the eggs, I handled the meat." Asuka collapsed on the sofa, next to an equally exhausted looking Rei.  
“她对付鸡蛋，我负责肉类。”明日香瘫倒在沙发上，旁边是同样疲惫不堪的绫波。

Smiling at the two beaten girls, Shinji sat down at the table.  
对着两位筋疲力尽的女孩微笑，真嗣在桌旁坐下。

"Thanks for the food!" With caution thrown to the wind, he picked up his first mouthful and dug in. After about five minutes of furious eating later, Shinji put down his plate, and reminisced.  
"谢谢款待！" 他不顾一切地拿起第一口，大快朵颐。大约五分钟后，真嗣放下盘子，陷入了回忆。

He was surprised he was still alive, and more importantly...  
他惊讶自己还活着，更重要的是……

"That was probably the best breakfast I have ever had in my entire life." The two girls smiled after hearing the compliment.  
"那大概是我这辈子吃过的最棒的早餐了。" 听到这番赞美，两位女孩露出了微笑。

"It had better have been. Dear god, cooking is way harder than anything I've ever done in my life!"  
最好是这样。天哪，做饭可比我在生活中做过的任何事情都难多了！

After the meal, there were plans to go out for the day. It was then Rei decided that she could show everyone another useful feature with the bracelets. Everybody was sat in front of Rei, Misato included, as she began her mini-lesson.  
饭后，大家计划外出一天。就在这时，丽决定向大家展示手环的另一个实用功能。所有人都坐在丽面前，包括美里，她开始了一场迷你课程。

"We can use the bracelets to quickly and easily change clothes. The bracelet can store up to one hundred and eight different types of clothes that we can assign a name and category to. For example-...!"  
"我们可以利用这些手环快速轻松地更换衣服。手环能储存多达一百零八种不同类型的服装，我们可以为它们命名并分类。比如说——...！"

"WAITWAITWAIT, stop!" Asuka quickly covered Shinji's eyes as the blue-headed girl began to activate her bracelet. "You're not going to change in front of him are you!? He'll see everything!"  
"等等等等，停下！" 明日香迅速捂住真嗣的眼睛，因为蓝头发的女孩开始激活她的手环。"你不会打算在他面前换衣服吧？！他会看到一切的！"

"To begin with, if its Ikari, I wouldn't mind in the slightest..."  
"说起来，如果是碇的话，我一点儿也不介意..."

"HEY!" Asuka's eyes widened as she tried leaping for Rei, stopped only by Shinji holding her back.  
“嘿！”明日香瞪大了眼睛，试图扑向绫波，却被真嗣拦住了。

"But the bracelet covers for that, by applying a veil of light over the body. The exchange of clothes happens near-instantaneously, so we are effectively censored." Ignoring Shinji's muttered remarks of how badly that sucked, Misato suddenly piped up.  
"但手环通过在身体上覆盖一层光幕来解决这个问题。换衣服几乎是瞬间完成的，所以我们实际上是被屏蔽了。" 无视真嗣低声抱怨这有多糟糕，美里突然插话道。

"So it's something like a magical girl transformation like you see in those old anime's?"  
"所以它有点像那些老动漫里的魔法少女变身？"

"I... think so?" Rei didn't sound entirely sure of herself. "I haven't really seen a lot of anime, if any at all if I'm being honest." Ignoring her, Asuka jumped up, excited to try out the new feature.  
"我... 应该是吧？" 绫波听起来并不完全确定。"老实说，我其实没看过多少动漫，如果有的话。" 无视她的疑虑，明日香兴奋地跳起来，迫不及待要尝试这个新功能。

"This is going to save me so much time getting ready in the morning! Does it do your hair as well?" At Rei's nod, she practically squealed with joy.  
"这会让我早上准备节省好多时间！它还能帮你做头发吗？" 看到丽点头，她几乎高兴得尖叫起来。

"I swear I've dreamt of this day my entire life!" She lifted her bracelet arm up so that it pointed to the sky, attempting a cool pose she had seen in the anime's.  
"我发誓我这辈子都在梦寐以求这一天！" 她抬起戴着手镯的手臂指向天空，试图摆出一个她在动漫里见过的酷酷的姿势。

"I should probably mention that..." Ignoring Rei once again, Asuka happily chanted for the set of clothes she wore the most often.  
"我应该提一下的……" 无视了丽，明日香开心地念出了她最常穿的那套衣服的咒语。

"School uniform!" "校服！"

"...that you need to be wearing the clothes and set them to the bracelet before doing it for the first time... the transformation will fail otherwise and..." Rei faltered off, sounding genuinely worried. She was not alone, the sentiment was felt by everybody in the room. Especially for Shinji who had been sat right in front of what was now a full-frontal birthday suit version of his childhood friend.  
"...你需要在第一次使用前穿上衣服并设定到手环上...否则变身会失败，而且..." 丽的声音渐渐弱了下去，听起来真的很担心。房间里的每个人都感受到了这种情绪。尤其是真嗣，他就坐在他儿时好友现在全裸的面前。

Asuka was in complete and utter shock.  
明日香完全惊呆了。

Regaining his senses was by no means an easy feat, Shinji had wanted to burn the image in front of him into his retinas for a little while longer, but every single instinctual fibre in his being was telling him to run, and run as far as he possibly could.  
恢复意识绝非易事，真嗣本想将眼前这一幕烙印在视网膜上再久一些，但他的每一根本能的纤维都在告诉他逃跑，跑得越远越好。

But just as he was getting out of his chair and backing away towards the door, he heard the scariest voice in the world come out of Asuka's shaking mouth.  
但就在他起身离开椅子，向门口退去时，他听到了世界上最可怕的声音从明日香颤抖的嘴里传出。

"Come here Shinji." “过来，真嗣。”

"I think its far safer if I stay over here to be perfectly honest." Asuka looked up at him with an unrivalled rage in her eyes as she leapt the distance between Shinji and herself.  
“老实说，我觉得我待在这边要安全得多。”明日香抬头瞪着他，眼中燃烧着无法遏制的怒火，随即一跃而起，跨越了与真嗣之间的距离。

"STAND STILL! I need to beat this memory out of you!"  
"站住别动！我得把你这段记忆打出来！"

It took almost two hours to calm the raging German girl down.  
花了将近两个小时才让那个暴怒的德国女孩平静下来。

---

"So what do we do now, Gendo?"  
"那我们现在怎么办，源堂？"

The bespectacled man sat at his desk, his orange-tinted glasses reflecting the monitor on his desk, head resting on top of his interlocked fingers. He wore a grim expression, which reflected on the tone of his voice as he spoke.  
戴眼镜的男子坐在桌前，橙色镜片的眼镜反射着桌上的显示器，头枕在交扣的指尖上。他面色凝重，说话的语气也透露出同样的沉重。

"We don't have many other options, do we?"  
“我们没有太多其他选择了，是吧？”

"You're being overly dramatic about all this."  
"你在这件事上太夸张了。"

"Overly dramatic!? This is SEELE we're talking about Yui! I'd say I'm being a little under-dramatic if anything!" Yui rolled her eyes as she glanced over his shoulder at the monitor.  
"太夸张了？！我们说的是 SEELE，Yui！如果有什么的话，我觉得自己还表现得不够夸张呢！" Yui 翻了个白眼，目光越过他的肩膀看向显示器。

"Misato will keep an eye on the kids, and she has her own bracelet now, so she'll be alright."  
"美里会照看孩子们的，她现在有自己的手环了，所以她会没事的。"

"What if they send the JSSDF into the school? Three kids and one teacher cannot protect an entire school, no matter what crazy powers we think they might have."  
"如果他们派自卫队进入学校怎么办？三个孩子和一个老师无法保护整个学校，无论我们觉得他们可能拥有多么疯狂的力量。"

"You know, its normally me doing all the worrying. What's got you so spooked Gendo?"  
"你知道的，通常都是我在担心。是什么让你这么紧张，源堂？"

His eyes turned to the desk, his face hidden in shadows and dark thoughts. Memories of a past life were coming back to haunt him. Memories of when he should have spent less time worried about his work and more time worried about how to be a father.  
他的目光转向书桌，脸庞隐没在阴影和阴郁的思绪中。前世的记忆正悄然回潮，萦绕心头。那些本该少些工作忧虑、多些如何成为好父亲思考的时光。

"I just... I don't want to lose him. I don't want to lose any of them..."  
“我只是……我不想失去他。我不想失去他们中的任何一个……”

His sincerity and sudden sombre mood had Yui stunned. Where did this come from all of a sudden? Gendo wasn't normally one for revealing his troubles. Snaking her arms around his shoulders, she leant her head on top of his and smiled.  
他的真诚和突如其来的忧郁让唯感到震惊。这一切是怎么突然冒出来的？源堂通常不是一个会表露烦恼的人。她伸出双臂环绕他的肩膀，将头靠在他的头上，微笑着。

"They'll be fine. I promise you now, we've worked too hard to let anything happen to them. Not to mention, they're all incredibly smart kids for their age. And Misato is far more intelligent then she lets those around her think."  
“他们会没事的。我向你保证，我们已经付出了太多努力，不会让任何事情发生在他们身上。更不用说，他们都是同龄人中极其聪明的孩子。而且美里远比她让周围人认为的要聪明得多。”

Her warm words brought a huge amount of comfort to him. A rarely seen smile flickered from underneath his hands that concealed his mouth. It was just what he had needed to hear.  
她温暖的话语给他带来了巨大的安慰。一个罕见的微笑从他遮住嘴巴的手下闪现。这正是他需要听到的。

The following morning, things were considerably peaceful, considering the mayhem that had occurred on the last day of the weekend. Walking along the road, Asuka felt the urge to skip, and almost gave in to her desires. But her pride wouldn't let her live with herself if the two knuckleheads behind her caught wind of what she was doing.  
次日清晨，考虑到周末最后一天的混乱，一切显得相当平静。走在路上，明日香有种想跳起来的冲动，几乎就要屈服于这份欲望。但她的自尊心不允许，如果身后那两个笨蛋察觉到她的举动，她可无法原谅自己。

She'd have to move to a country on the other side of the world, after carefully hiding the bodies.  
她得搬到地球另一端的国家去，还得小心翼翼地藏好尸体。

Still, she couldn't help herself but hum as she walked on the familiar path to school. Something that Rei had found it difficult to ignore for the past twenty minutes.  
尽管如此，她走在通往学校的熟悉小路上时，还是忍不住哼起了小曲。这让丽在过去二十分钟里很难忽视。

"You seem to be in an altogether cheerful mood this morning Asuka."  
“你今天早上似乎心情特别好，明日香。”

"You'll be too, after school tomorrow."  
"你明天放学后也会的。"

Shinji had promised both of them a date. Well, promised was a little subjective, but after cooking for him yesterday and after the vanishing clothes incident, they had both got a date out of the deal. Separately of course, but today was the day he'd be going out with Asuka. The following day would be Rei's turn.  
真嗣曾向她们两人承诺过一次约会。嗯，说‘承诺’或许有点主观，但在昨天为他做饭以及那次消失的衣服事件之后，她们都从这笔交易中得到了一次约会的机会。当然，是分别进行的，但今天是他将与明日香出去的日子。接下来的一天则是绫波的约会时间。

He'd had to resort to petitioning the bank of Mom and Dad in lieu of funds for the operation, but she didn't care about that right now. Her head was full of thoughts on what exactly they were going to do with their afternoon together. And how to make Shinji as bankrupt as possible before it was Rei's turn.  
他不得不求助于父母的银行来筹措资金，但她现在并不在乎这些。她的脑海里充满了关于他们下午将如何度过以及如何在轮到绫波之前尽可能让真嗣破产的想法。

Sitting on her chair in the classroom, she couldn't help but grin. Her leg was bouncing up and down wildly under her chair, something that her friend, Hikari, had picked up on almost instantly sitting in front of her.  
坐在教室的椅子上，她忍不住咧嘴笑了。她的腿在椅子下疯狂地上下弹动，坐在她前面的朋友光几乎立刻就注意到了这一点。

"I've never seen you smiling so much Asuka. Are you feeling okay? Do you want me to take you to the nurses office?"  
"我从没见过你笑得这么开心，明日香。你感觉还好吗？需要我带你去医务室吗？"

"Ha ha ha, shut up Hikari. I'm always in a fabulous mood and I take offence that you'd imply that I was ever a moody c-..."  
"哈哈哈，闭嘴吧，光。我总是心情超棒，你居然暗示我以前情绪不好，真是冒犯我了……"

"Nobody's going that far Asuka!" Hikari hastily stopped the chattering redhead, before letting out a giggle.  
“没人会走那么远的，明日香！” 光急忙制止了喋喋不休的红发女孩，随后忍不住笑出声来。

"But really... What's got you in such a good mood? I bet its to do with Shinji."  
但说真的...是什么让你心情这么好？我打赌这跟真嗣有关。

Asuka hadn't planned on how to cover it up if the topic had ever come up in class. As a result, the panic caused her to suddenly elbow her pencil case, sending it pinwheeling off her desk, its contents flying everywhere.  
明日香并没有预想过如果课堂上有人提起这件事该如何掩饰。因此，当话题突然出现时，她惊慌失措，手肘不慎撞到了笔袋，使其旋转着从桌上飞出，里面的物品散落一地。

"Haha, I guess that answers my question." Hikari chuckled as she helped the flustered girl pick up the pieces.  
“哈哈，看来这回答了我的问题。”光笑着，帮那位慌乱的女孩捡起碎片。

"Does that mean it's a date? Are you going on a date with Shinji!?"  
那是不是意味着这是约会？你要和真嗣去约会吗？！

"Why don't you say it a little louder!? I don't think the entire class heard you!" Asuka hissed as she tried to keep the bubble-mouthed class president silent.  
“你为什么不说得再大声点！？我觉得全班还没听到呢！” 明日香低声咆哮，试图让那位嘴巴像泡泡一样的班长闭嘴。

Instead of being quiet, Hikari made a strange squeaking noise, only fueling Asuka's rapidly spreading blush. She had to do something fast to stop the news spreading. Luckily, Misato chose that exact moment to wander through the door, looking strangely scared.  
非但没有安静下来，光却发出了一声奇怪的吱吱声，这让明日香的脸红得更快了。她必须尽快采取行动阻止消息扩散。幸运的是，美里恰好在那一刻推门而入，神情显得异常惊恐。

"Hey teach, I like the bracelet!"  
“嘿，老师，我喜欢那个手镯！”

Her new purple accessory shimmered in the light of the sun as she put her stuff on the desk.  
她新添的紫色配饰在阳光下闪闪发光，随着她将物品摆放在桌上。

"Thank you Toji, be sure you say the nice things to Hikari too when you have the chance."  
"谢谢你，冬二，有机会也别忘了对光说些好听的话。"

Both students immediately went redder than the sun, with Toji stumbling over his words as he tried to make excuses, with Kensuke laughing at him.  
两位学生立刻脸红得比太阳还红，冬二结结巴巴地试图找借口，而健介在一旁笑他。

"Miss, you can't-!" Hikari stopped her planned tirade when she felt Asuka poke her from behind.  
"老师，你不能——！"光正要发作，却感觉到背后的明日香戳了她一下。

"I'd say that's a pretty generous serving of karma, don't you think?" Grinning at her friend, Asuka laughed as she watched Hikari's face flash through about twenty different expressions, raging from indignant to embarrassed.  
“我得说，这可是相当慷慨的因果报应，你不觉得吗？”看着好友，明日香笑着，只见光的脸色变幻了约莫二十种表情，从愤愤不平到窘迫不已。

After the brief distraction, Misato's face went back to serious business, glancing specifically at both Shinji and Asuka with a worried glance. Feeling caught off-guard, both of them wondered what had their teacher so spooked. She even had her own all-powerful bracelet now, what could she possibly be so scared of?  
短暂的走神过后，Misato 的脸色又恢复了严肃，她特意用忧虑的目光扫视了 Shinji 和 Asuka。两人感到措手不及，不知道是什么让他们的老师如此惊慌。她现在连自己那无所不能的手镯都有了，还有什么能让她害怕的呢？

"First things first ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to introduce a transfer student."  
女士们先生们，首先让我们欢迎一位转学生。

"Another one!?" Toji cheered from the back of the class. "Please let it be another cutie, and god please don't let her anywhere near Shinji."  
"又来一个！？" 冬二在教室后排欢呼道，"请让她是个可爱的女孩，天啊，千万别让她靠近真嗣。"

Shinji nodded violently in agreement. He didn't need anymore crazy girls in his life. Asuka had also nodded crazily, her thoughts in almost perfect-sync with her romantic interest.  
真嗣猛烈地点头表示同意。他不需要生活中再有更多疯狂的女孩了。明日香也疯狂地点头，她的想法几乎与她的恋爱对象完全同步。

"Please treat her with respect and Hikari?"  
"请尊重她，还有光？"

"Yes teacher?" "是的，老师？"

"Make sure Toji doesn't end up molesting her." Hikari's eyes lit up with a raging fire, accented with a terrifying grin.  
“确保冬二不会对她动手动脚。”光的眼神中燃起了熊熊怒火，嘴角勾起一抹骇人的笑意。

"You can count on me!" Nodding in approval, Misato ignored Toji's protests of innocence and turned her gaze towards the door.  
"你放心交给我吧！" 美里点头表示同意，无视了真嗣的清白辩解，将目光转向了门口。

"Okay, you may come in!"  
“好的，你可以进来了！”

The door gently slid open. After what felt like an eternity, a creamy white shoe entered through the threshold, and once again, Shinji Ikari felt like his world had ended in a heartbeat.  
门轻轻地滑开了。仿佛过了一个世纪，一只奶白色的鞋子跨过门槛，而再一次，碇真嗣感到他的世界在瞬间终结了。

"Hello everyone, its a pleasure to meet you! I'm a little bit nervous but I hope we can all get along!"  
“大家好，很高兴见到你们！我有点紧张，但希望我们能好好相处！”

A cerulean-blue pair of eyes had found their mark, centering onto Shinji's dark grey ones. He felt terror, unaware that he had never been this scared in his life. The lips under those eyes curled into a sweet smile. She brushed a strand of her darkened crimson hair out of face.  
一双天蓝色的眼眸锁定了目标，聚焦在真嗣深灰色的双眸上。他感到恐惧，未曾意识到自己一生中从未如此害怕过。那双眼睛下的唇角勾起一抹甜美的微笑。她轻轻拂开脸颊上的一缕深红发丝。

"Especially with you, Shinji Ikari."  
“尤其是你，碇真嗣。”

### Chapter 6: Run! 第六章：快跑！  

Standing at the front of the class with her sparkling smile gleaming, Mana Kirishima beamed at him as Shinji sat in his chair, paralysed by fear.  
站在教室前排，闪耀的笑容熠熠生辉，Mana Kirishima 对他微笑着，而 Shinji 坐在椅子上，因恐惧而动弹不得。

"Oh my god, really!?" Toji cried, echoing the sentiment of all the boys in the class. The girls had started whispering and giggling with each other at the sudden new development.  
“我的天，真的吗！？”Toji 喊道，这番话也代表了班上所有男生的心声。女生们则开始窃窃私语，对这突如其来的新情况咯咯笑了起来。

"_Another girl!?_" “又是一个女孩！？”

"I thought he was engaged or something to Rei?"  
“我以为他和丽订婚了呢？”

"He's got three girls on the go!? _At his age!?_"  
“他同时和三个女孩交往！？他这年纪！？”

"What about Asuka? She is going to _**flip**_..."  
"那明日香呢？她会气炸的……"

The girl in question could hear nothing of the gossip floating around the class. All she could hear was the sound of her rapidly raging pulse.  
当事人对班上流传的八卦一无所知，她只能听到自己急速跳动的心跳声。

Rei, on the other hand, was sat stock still in her chair by the window, in shock and looking very dazed.  
另一方面，丽坐在窗边的椅子上，一动不动，震惊得看起来有些茫然。

"Shinji...? You feeling okay?" Misato asked gingerly, aware that he was probably going through an internal meltdown. Mana kept up her radiant smile as she took a step towards his table.  
"真嗣...？你感觉还好吗？" 美里小心翼翼地问道，意识到他可能正在经历内心的崩溃。真奈保持着她那灿烂的笑容，向他的桌子迈了一步。

"He's probably just surprised."  
"他可能只是惊讶而已。"

"Let me slap him! Just once! It won't even hurt...!" Toji was furiously shouting from his chair as Hikari tried her best to keep him under control. She was beginning to consider taking a page from Asuka's book and putting him into a headlock.  
"让我扇他一巴掌！就一下！根本不会疼的...！" 东治从椅子上愤怒地喊道，而光子正尽力控制住他。她开始考虑效仿明日香的做法，给他来个锁喉。

"It's been about eight years Shinji." Mana had stopped in front of the visibly shaken boy.  
"已经过去大约八年了，真嗣。" 玛娜在明显动摇的男孩面前停下了脚步。

"_Do you remember me?_" "你还记得我吗？"

Something inside him snapped. Standing up as fast as he could, he bolted for the classroom door as fast as humanly possible.  
他内心有什么东西崩断了。他尽可能快地站起来，以人类可能达到的最快速度冲向教室门。

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

Misato's shout of surprise went unanswered as the poor boy literally leapt over tables trying to get away.  
美里惊讶的呼喊没有得到回应，可怜的男孩简直是跳过桌子试图逃走。

"**OH NO YOU DON'T!**" "休想逃！"

Mana's cry echoed around the classroom as she lifted up her arm. It was only then Rei, who had started recovering from her stupor, noticed that Mana was wearing a cerulean bracelet.  
玛娜的哭声在教室里回荡，她举起手臂。直到这时，从恍惚中开始恢复的丽才注意到，玛娜戴着一只天蓝色的手镯。

Just like the one she wore.  
就像她自己戴的那只一样。

Seconds later, her attention was diverted to the fact that Shinji was now enveloped in a bubble-like prison, stopping the panic-stricken boy from escaping.  
几秒钟后，她的注意力被转移到真嗣被一个气泡般的牢笼困住的事实上，这个惊慌失措的男孩无法逃脱。

"Shinji... " Mana purred flirtatiously as she began to walk towards the entrapped boy.  
"真嗣... " 玛娜挑逗地低声说道，开始向被困的男孩走去。

"You mustn't run away." "你不能逃跑。"

"**SOMEBODY SAVE ME!**" Shinji shrieked in a voice that could only be described as the embodiment of blood-curdling terror as he banged from the inside of the bubble fruitlessly.  
"谁来救救我！" 真嗣尖叫着，声音只能被形容为令人毛骨悚然的恐惧化身，他在泡泡内部徒劳地敲打着。

Needless to say, the whole class was in shock. Even Asuka, Rei and Misato, who were used to seeing this kind of supernatural science, were left dumbfounded.  
毋庸置疑，全班都陷入了震惊之中。即便是习惯了这种超自然科学的绫波零、惣流·明日香·兰格雷和葛城美里，也都被惊得目瞪口呆。

"I've waited a long time to see you again." Inside the bubble, shackles materialised around Shinji's arms, locking them behind his back. A collar with a chained leash appeared around his neck.  
“我等了很久，终于又见到你了。”在泡泡内部，锁链缠绕在真嗣的手臂上，将它们锁在背后。一个带有链条的项圈出现在他的脖子上。

"W-w w-what the hell is this!?" He looked down at his new accessories, utterly terrified. The bubble around him popped, and he dropped unceremoniously to the ground. Picking up the leash, a grin that would have a yandere running for the hills replaced her sweet smile from moments before.  
“这、这到底是什么鬼东西！？”他低头看着自己的新配饰，完全吓坏了。围绕他的泡泡破裂了，他狼狈地摔在地上。她捡起牵引绳，刚才的甜美笑容被一个足以让病娇逃跑的狞笑所取代。

"I've told you this already, but I'll tell you again." Mana stood over him, her figure a hundred times more intimidating than Asuka's could ever be. Somewhere in his brain, a little voice quietly muttered that her black-lace panties that were peeking out from under her skirt were rather daring, but it was drowned out by the rest of his brain shrieking from the horrifying smile she was giving him.  
"我已经告诉过你这件事了，但我还会再告诉你一遍。" 玛娜站在他上方，她的身影比明日香能有的任何姿态都要可怕百倍。在他脑海的某个角落，一个小小的声音悄悄嘀咕着她裙下露出的黑色蕾丝内裤颇为大胆，但这声音被他大脑其余部分因她那恐怖的微笑而发出的尖叫声淹没了。

"_You mustn't run away._" "你绝不能逃跑。"

---

"What's their status!?" Yui yelled to the room. Maya, Shigeru and Aoba all jumped to attention, alongside Satsuki, Kaede and Aoi on their various terminals. Furious typing could be heard around the control room, overlooked by Gendo Ikari in his trademark pose, leaning on his interlocked fingers.  
"他们的状况如何！？" 绫波零向房间里喊道。真希、茂和青叶都立刻集中注意力，与在各自终端前的皋月、枫和葵一起。控制室内回荡着激烈的键盘敲击声，被以标志性姿势——双手交叠支撑着下巴——的碇源堂监视着。

"Shinji's been kidnapped, and is being held hostage in a... bubble-like prison?" Satsuki looked at her monitor in confusion. "I don't understand what's going on at all..."  
"真嗣被绑架了，还被关在一个...泡泡一样的监狱里？" 萨兹琪困惑地看着她的显示器。"我完全搞不懂这是怎么回事..."

"You're telling me. Who is this girl?" Kaede looked at the video footage displaying one of the school's corridors, keeping track of the red-headed girl holding Shinji hostage. Her eyes suddenly widened. "Oh shit!"  
"你问我，我问谁。这个女孩是谁？" 枫看着显示学校走廊的视频，追踪着那个挟持真嗣的红发女孩。她的眼睛突然睁大了。"哦，该死！"

All of the monitors in the room suddenly flashed.  
房间里所有的显示器突然闪烁起来。

"Explosion detected! Major damage to the school exterior on the third floor!"  
"检测到爆炸！学校三楼外墙遭受重大损坏！"

"Are the kids okay!?" "孩子们没事吧！？"

"No injuries! Asuka and Rei are in pursuit of Shinji and the mysterious girl."  
"无人受伤！明日香和绫波正在追捕真嗣和那位神秘女孩。"

Yui gritted her teeth as she watched the ongoing battle on the giant main screen. It seemed like she knew the girl from somewhere, but the memory was proving to be elusive.  
优看着巨大的主屏幕上正在进行的战斗，咬紧了牙关。她似乎在某个地方见过那个女孩，但记忆却难以捉摸。

"Do you not recognise her, Yui?" The gravelly tones emanating from Gendo slightly surprised her. He wasn't usually in such a somber mood.  
“你不认识她吗，优？”源堂那沙哑的声音让她略感惊讶。他平时很少有这么严肃的情绪。

"What, do you?" She turned around to face her husband.  
“怎么，你认识？”她转过身来面对她的丈夫。

"Eight years ago. She was the survivor."  
"八年前。她是幸存者。"

The memories flooded back to her, each more heartbreaking than the last. Turning to face the screen again, her eyes were glued to the girl's face, now recognisable to her.  
记忆如潮水般涌回，每一份都比前一份更令人心碎。她再次转向屏幕，目光紧紧锁定在那女孩的脸上，如今已能认出。

"But... why? What's she doing?! And why does she have a bracelet!?" Gendo's eyes appeared colder than ice as he peered over his orange-tinted glasses.  
"但是...为什么？她在做什么？！还有她为什么戴着手镯！？" 碇源堂透过橙色镜片的眼眸显得比冰还要冷。

"Our _friends_ have managed to pull the rug from under our feet once again."  
"我们的朋友们又一次成功地让我们措手不及。"

---

Alarms were blaring all over the school. The students had been evacuated and the perimeter had been surrounded by police and the military. Helicopters buzzed angrily overhead, occasionally blocking out the sun which was beginning to set, turning the sky an ominous crimson.  
警报声在学校各处此起彼伏。学生们已被疏散，警方和军队将周边团团围住。直升机在头顶愤怒地嗡嗡作响，不时遮住初升的太阳，将天空染成不祥的深红。

Misato was outside with the students, making sure everyone was safe, whilst occasionally glancing back at the school, panic-stricken.  
美里和学生们在外面，确保每个人都是安全的，同时不时紧张地回头望向学校。

"_We have identified a potential terrorist threat on the school premises. Do not enter the school or surrounding area for any reason until further notice_."  
“我们已经识别到学校范围内存在潜在的恐怖威胁。在进一步通知之前，请勿以任何理由进入学校或周边区域。”

The school PA system was echoing what was also being broadcast outside to the civilians and students milling around the school gates. Asuka smirked as she continued running around the school corridors.  
学校的广播系统正重复播放着同样的内容，这些信息也被传达到学校大门外聚集的平民和学生们耳中。明日香一边继续在学校的走廊里奔跑，一边露出了得意的笑容。

"Her first day here and she's branded as a terrorist. That's certainly an achievement."  
她第一天来就被打上了恐怖分子的标签。这确实是个‘成就’。

She continued running down the corridors, her eyes peeled at every corner and doorway she came across. Judging from the giant hole that tore a large chunk away from the third floor corridor, she had come to assume that Mana wasn't taking any chances.  
她继续沿着走廊奔跑，对每一个角落和门口都保持高度警惕。从三楼走廊上那个巨大的破洞来看，她推测玛娜不会放过任何机会。

It was kill or be killed.  
不是你死就是我亡。

As she came up to the next corridor's corner, she suddenly heard footsteps. Slowing down to a crawl, she tiptoed her way towards the corner, her back pressed against the wall. Her hands were shaking, causing the bracelet to rattle.  
当她走到下一个走廊的拐角时，突然听到了脚步声。她放慢速度，蹑手蹑脚地向拐角靠近，背部紧贴着墙壁。她的手在颤抖，导致手镯发出响声。

"Come on Asuka... GO!" Clenching her teeth, she jumped around the corner and raised her bracelet arm's palm to attack. She was faced with Rei, in exactly the same stance.  
“来吧，明日香...冲啊！”她咬紧牙关，跳过拐角，举起戴着手镯的手掌准备攻击。却看到绫波零，正摆着完全相同的姿势。

"Jesus! I was ready to blow you to hell..."  
天哪！我差点就把你轰进地狱了...

"I can see that. Better luck next time, I suppose." Asuka was this close to giving the sarcastic girl a slap in response, but decided against it for the moment. "I assume this means you've had no success finding him either."  
"我看得出来。下次运气好点吧，我想。" 明日香差点就要给这个爱挖苦的女孩一巴掌，但暂时决定忍住。"我猜这意味着你也没找到他。"

"What do you think, genius..." Asuka sighed as she ran her fingers through her hair. They had lost contact with Shinji a while back, after Mana had nearly obliterated them both.  
"你以为呢，天才..." 明日香叹了口气，手指穿过头发。他们和真嗣失去联系已经有一段时间了，自从玛娜差点把他们俩都干掉之后。"

"We better stick together from now, and watch each others backs. Splitting up was a good idea, but we're more likely to end up killing each other if we're jumping at shadows..."  
"我们最好从现在开始一起行动，互相照应。分开是个好主意，但如果我们总是疑神疑鬼，更有可能自相残杀..."

"I agree." Rei nodded. Suddenly, Rei jumped forward, catching Asuka around the waist and pushing her to the ground. "Watch out!"  
"我同意。" 丽点了点头。突然，丽向前一跃，搂住明日香的腰将她推倒在地。"小心！"

Another explosion tore through the windows they had been standing next to not a second earlier. Sparkling glass showered over them as the windows buckled. Shards cut into the both of them, leaving a nasty cut on Asuka's face and a similar wound over Rei's arm.  
又一声爆炸在他们刚刚站立的窗户旁炸开，玻璃如雨般闪烁着碎片洒落。窗户扭曲变形，碎片划伤了两人，在明日香的脸颊上留下一道狰狞的伤口，而零的胳膊上也出现了类似的伤痕。

"She... is so dead... Owowowow..." Asuka twinged in pain as she stood up. Helping Rei to her feet, their eyes met. Nodding together, they began running towards the staircase.  
"她...死定了...哎哟哟哟..." 明日香痛苦地站起身来。她扶起丽，两人的目光相遇。一起点头后，她们开始向楼梯跑去。

"She's outside!" "她在外面！"

---

"You've suddenly gone incredibly quiet Shinji"  
"你突然变得异常安静，真嗣"

"I doubt you'd be overly conversational either if your captor was a maniacal pyrotechnic who had you locked in a darkened gym storage room."  
"如果绑架你的人是个疯狂的烟火师，把你锁在黑暗的体育馆储藏室里，我想你也不会太健谈的。"

He couldn't really make out much in the dark, but he was well aware that Mana was straddled on top of him. When he squinted, he could just about make out the mischievous grin on her face.  
他在黑暗中看不太清楚，但他很清楚玛娜正骑在他身上。当他眯起眼睛时，勉强能看到她脸上调皮的笑容。

"I'm pretty sure this is every teenage boy's dream, isn't it? To be underneath a hot girl in a dark room?"  
"我敢肯定，这是每个青春期男孩的梦想，不是吗？在黑暗的房间里被一个火辣的女孩压在下面？"

"I see you're not aware of your own narcissism."  
"看来你还没意识到自己的自恋倾向。"

Mana just smiled even more as she leaned in closer to his face, wrapping her arms around his neck.  
玛娜只是笑得更灿烂，她更靠近他的脸，双臂环抱住他的脖子。

"But I am aware that I'm way cuter than Asuka or Rei." She whispered into his ear. A raging flush rushed across his face, and he was rapidly becoming aware that his trousers were becoming painfully tight across his groin.  
"但我很清楚，我比明日香或绫波都要可爱得多。" 她在他耳边低语。他脸上涌起一阵狂热的潮红，他迅速意识到自己的裤子在胯部变得异常紧绷。

His nerves were on fire as he struggled to look for a response. It was true that he found Mana incredibly cute, and her bold, daring behaviour was not exactly unwelcome.  
他的神经如同被点燃般紧张，努力寻找着回应。确实，他觉得 Mana 非常可爱，她大胆无畏的行为也并非不受欢迎。

But he was also aware that if he didn't do something soon, Asuka and Rei would find them both in this compromising situation. He was sure they would destroy the school between them if that happened.  
但他也清楚，如果再不采取行动，Asuka 和 Rei 很快就会发现他们处于这种尴尬境地。他确信，真要那样，她们俩能把学校给拆了。

"I can't really deny that you are incredibly cute, putting aside the fact that you are a terrifying person." Shinji started talking as he began to struggle against his shackles. Whatever Mana was doing with her bracelet was cancelling out his ability to use his own.  
“我无法否认你的确非常可爱，尽管你是个可怕的人。” 真嗣开口说道，同时开始挣扎着摆脱束缚。Mana 用她的手镯所施展的某种力量，正在抵消他使用自身能力的可能。

But he had a theory.  
但他有一个理论。

For whatever reason, it seemed that the bracelets reacted to emotion. Not only that, but using them for extended periods of time would leave the user exhausted.  
无论出于何种原因，似乎这些手镯会对情绪产生反应。不仅如此，长时间使用它们会让使用者感到极度疲惫。

His plan meant that not only would he have to try something risky, it was dependant on Mana being somewhat already tired.  
他的计划意味着他不仅要尝试冒险的事情，还取决于麻奈是否已经有些疲倦。

And having her wrapped around his neck, breathing heavily into his ear was making it really hard to put his plan into action.  
她紧紧环绕在他脖子上，沉重地呼吸着，吹拂过他的耳畔，这让他实施计划变得异常困难。

Mana giggled, tightening her grip around him as she continued to whisper into his ear.  
麻奈咯咯笑着，双手更紧地环抱着他，继续在他耳边低语。

"I'm glad that you think so, Shinji. I've been waiting for you to say something like that for a very, very long time."  
“我很高兴你这么想，真嗣。我等你这么说已经等了很久很久了。”

Something about the way she said that didn't sit well with him. It almost sounded... sorrowful.  
她说话的方式让他感到不安，那语气几乎带着...悲伤。

Leaning up slightly, Shinji was met with her eyes. Eyes that seemed almost ready to cry.  
微微抬起身，真嗣迎上了她的目光。那双眼似乎随时都会流泪。

"Shinji... Did you miss me?"  
“真嗣...你想我了吗？”

Something was definitely off now. Where did all of her energy suddenly go? Why did she look like she was ready to have a mental breakdown? A million more questions rushed through his mind, but he realised he didn't have the time to think about it too hard right now. He had to do something before Asuka caught them together like this.  
现在肯定有什么不对劲。她的精力都突然消失到哪里去了？为什么她看起来像是快要精神崩溃了？无数的问题涌入他的脑海，但他意识到现在没有时间深究这些。他必须做点什么，以免明日香发现他们这样在一起。

"Mana..." He felt his shackles crumble underneath him. He hadn't done anything to set himself free, so it must have been her own doing.  
"真名..." 他感到身上的枷锁在他身下崩解。他没有采取任何行动来解放自己，所以这一定是她自己的行为。

"Save me Shinji... You have to save me..." She whispered again, this time her voice trembling. Before she had the chance to break down, Shinji wrapped his arms around her back, twisting his body so that he was now on top of her. He had somehow ended up straddling her, their positions reversed.  
"救救我，真嗣... 你必须救我..." 她再次低声说道，这次声音颤抖。在她崩溃之前，真嗣用双臂环抱住她的背部，扭转身体，让自己压在她身上。不知怎么地，他最终跨坐在她身上，两人的位置颠倒了。

"Mana, what's going on? Who do you need saving from?" Shinji had her bracelet arm held firmly with his right hand. But it seemed unnecessary at this point. It didn't look like she was going to fight back anymore.  
"Mana，怎么了？你需要从谁那里得救？" 真嗣用右手紧紧抓住她的手镯手臂。但此刻似乎没有必要了。看起来她不会再反抗了。

"Promise me you'll save me... From _them_." He was just about to ask who _they_ were. But with her free hand, Mana grabbed the back of Shinji's head, bringing him down closer to her face.  
"答应我你会救我……从他们手中。" 他正要问他们是谁。但用她自由的手，Mana 抓住了真嗣的后脑勺，把他拉近她的脸。

"You saved me back then. I know you can do it again." She smiled, a single tear streaming down her face. Closing her eyes, she brought herself closer, kissing a suddenly incredibly shocked Shinji.  
"那时你救了我。我知道你能再次做到。" 她微笑着，一滴泪顺着脸颊流下。闭上眼睛，她靠近了，吻了一个突然极度震惊的真嗣。

Her lips felt soft. That seemed to be the only thought that was running through his mind. Or it had been, until the door of the gym storage room blew open, revealing a horrified Asuka and Rei. Breaking off the kiss, Shinji sat up suddenly, painfully aware that he was still straddling Mana.  
她的唇感觉很柔软。这似乎是他脑海中唯一的念头。或者说，直到体育器材室的门突然被吹开，露出惊恐的明日香和绫波之前，这确实是他的唯一想法。中断了亲吻，真嗣突然坐起身，痛苦地意识到自己仍然跨坐在玛娜身上。

"I know you wouldn't believe me if I said it's not what it looks like, but can you at least believe that she started it?"  
“我知道即使我说这不是看上去的那样你们也不会相信，但至少能相信是她先开始的吗？”

### Chapter 7: Do You Remember Love?  
第七章：你还记得爱吗？  

Sitting, or rather, chained to a chair in the lowest level of the research laboratory's labyrinthian maze of corridors, Mana Kirishima was beaming. By all accounts, many other people would be, for want of a better phrase, crapping themselves.  
坐在椅子上，更确切地说，是被锁在研究实验室迷宫般走廊的最底层，雾岛 Mana 正笑容满面。按常理，许多人可能会用一个更贴切的词来形容，那就是吓得屁滚尿流。

But not Mana. And she wondered why he had always seen her as a bit of an oddball.  
但 Mana 不是这样。她不禁好奇，为什么他总认为她有点古怪。

"I suppose you're still in blissful shock over how good of a kisser I can be, huh?"  
"我想你还在为我的吻技之高超而陶醉得目瞪口呆吧？"

"Mana!" "真嗣！"

"What? It's true isn't it? Why else are you bright red and trying your hardest not to to look at me in the eyes. Why is there a pyramid in your trousers, and why do Asuka and Rei look like they want to disembowel me from behind the bulletproof glass?"  
"怎么了？这不是事实吗？不然你为什么满脸通红，还拼命不直视我。你裤子里怎么像藏了个金字塔，还有为什么明日香和丽在防弹玻璃后面看起来像要把我开膛破肚似的？"

"Can we please stay on topic? I'm supposed to be here to interrogate you..." Shinji sheepishly mumbled, wondering if this really was a good idea.  
“我们能请您保持话题吗？我应该在这里审问你的……” 真嗣尴尬地低声说道，心里怀疑这个主意是否真的靠谱。

But if Misato, his parents and the tech crew all agreed that it was, then apparently they saw something in him that he wasn't seeing.  
但如果美里、他的父母和科技团队都一致认为这是个好主意，那么显然他们在他身上看到了他自己未曾察觉的东西。

The two sets of eyes watching his every move that were not particularly pleased he was locked in a room with Mana were making him feel incredibly uncomfortable though.  
那两双紧盯着他一举一动的眼睛，尤其是当他与玛娜共处一室时，让他感到极度不自在。

"What the hell is he doing?" Asuka forced through gritted teeth. She pressed a button next to a microphone in front of her.  
“他到底在搞什么鬼？”明日香咬牙切齿地说道。她按下了面前麦克风旁边的一个按钮。

"_CAN YOU PLEASE GET ON WITH IT STUPID SHINJI!? I'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO TODAY THAN WATCH YOU FLIRT WITH THAT EXPLODING ASSHAT!_"  
“你能不能快点，愚蠢的真嗣！？我今天还有更重要的事要做，没空看你和那个爆炸混蛋调情！”

Looking less than amused, Shinji sighed deeply before continuing his failing interrogation. But before he even had the chance to open his mouth, Mana was straight back on the attack.  
真嗣看起来并不怎么高兴，他深深地叹了口气，继续他那毫无进展的审问。但还没等他有机会开口，真奈就立刻展开了反击。

"You know Shinji, all you gotta do is say those three magical words that every girl wants to hear, and I tell you absolutely everything."  
"你知道吗，真嗣，你只需要说出那三个每个女孩都想听的神奇字眼，我就会毫无保留地告诉你一切。"

"Like who you're working for?"  
"比如你为谁工作？"

"Who I'm working for, my three sizes, what I would be doing to you right now if it was you tied to this chair and how you would love every second of it..."  
"我为谁工作，我的三围，如果现在是你被绑在这椅子上我会对你做什么，以及你会如何享受每一刻......"

"_I'M GONNA RIP HER FACE OFF AND FRAME IT IN MY BEDROOM-Ack..._" He could distinctly hear Rei wrestling Asuka away from the microphone behind him, and sighed deeply again. If you lost a piece of happiness every time you sighed out loud, he should have been a depressed wreck years ago.  
"我要把她脸撕下来挂在我卧室里-哎呀..." 他能清楚地听到丽在背后把明日香从麦克风前拉开，又深深地叹了口气。如果每次叹气都失去一份幸福，他多年前就该是个抑郁的废人了。

"Mana... Today, you managed to basically blow up my school, almost killed two of my best friends-"  
"真那... 今天，你基本上把我的学校炸了，差点害死我两个最好的朋友-"

"_OH NO YOU DON'T! WE ARE NOT GETTING RELEGATED TO THE FRIEND ZONE THIS EARLY IN THE GAME!_" Somehow Asuka had managed to get back to the microphone.  
"哦不，你休想！我们可不会这么早就被降级到朋友区！" 不知怎么的，明日香又回到了麦克风前。

"_I agree with Soryu this time. We are_ _**more**_ _than just friends Shinji._"  
"这次我同意惣流。我们不仅仅是朋友，真嗣。"

Turning around to face the window the girls were irritating him from, Shinji glared at them both.  
真嗣转过身，面对着那些让他心烦的女孩们所在的窗户，瞪了她们两个一眼。

"Girls, I will do whatever you want me to for a week if you can let me finish what I'm supposed to be doing here. At some point, I would like to go home and eat something before some ungodly hour in the morning. Go and buy me a coffee or something."  
"女孩们，如果你们能让我在这里完成我该做的事，我愿意为你们做任何事一周。在某个时候，我想回家吃点东西，而不是在凌晨某个不合理的时刻。去给我买杯咖啡什么的吧。"

"_He likes Cafe au Lait, let's go Rei!_" And like that, the two girls sped off to the nearest vending machine in the facility, all smiles and evil giggles.  
"他喜欢法式拿铁，我们去吧，丽！" 就这样，两个女孩笑着，带着一丝狡黠的窃笑，飞快地向设施里最近的自动售货机跑去。

"Finally, some peace..." His thought process enjoyed the blissful seconds of quiet, before his mind reminded him he had something important to do.  
"终于，有些宁静了..." 他的思绪享受着这宁静的几秒钟，直到他的脑海提醒他还有件重要的事情要做。

Turning back around to face Mana on the chair, he wasn't expecting her to suddenly look so... depressed.  
他转过身来再次面对椅子上的玛娜，没想到她突然显得如此...沮丧。

Just like she had in those last few moments in the gym storage room.  
就像她在体育馆储物间最后那几刻所做的那样。

"Shinji..." Cerulean eyes looked up at him, almost pleading with him as she spoke.  
"真嗣..." 天蓝色的眼睛抬头望着他，几乎是在恳求般地对他说话。

"Do you remember eight years ago?"  
"你还记得八年前的事吗？"

---

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

A six-year-old Mana Kirishima came flying at him, not five seconds after he had stepped foot inside her parents apartment.  
他刚踏进她父母公寓不到五秒钟，六岁的小满就飞奔向他。

"I'm sorry to bother you like this..." Yui apologized to Mana's mother.  
""这样打扰你们真是抱歉..."" 绫波向小满的母亲道歉道。

It was clear who Mana got her crimson hair from, as her mother's own red locks flowed around as she shook her head. A long ponytail dangled a considerable length down her back as Natsuru Kirishima's green eyes practically sparkled as she ruffled six-year-old Shinji's hair.  
很明显，Mana 的深红色头发遗传自她的母亲，她母亲的红发在她摇头时飘扬四周。一条长长的马尾辫垂在背后，长度相当可观，而 Natsuru Kirishima 的绿眼睛闪闪发光，她轻轻地揉着六岁 Shinji 的头发。

"No, it's fine Yui! I'd happily look after this adorable ball of fluff anyday!"  
“不，Yui，没关系！我很乐意每天照顾这个可爱的小毛球！”

Yui smiled at her long time friend.  
Yui 对她的多年好友微笑着。

"This takes me back to when we were in school together."  
"这让我想起了我们一起上学的时候。"

"Ah, when we were talking about the day we would eventually have children and that we'd make sure they were the best of friends."  
“啊，当我们谈论着终有一天会有孩子，并确保他们成为最好的朋友。”

"I'm pretty sure it was more of a contest over who would have kids first, if I remember correctly." Yui giggled at the memories.  
“我记得那更像是一场关于谁会先有孩子的比赛，如果我没记错的话。” 回忆起往事，Yui 轻声笑了起来。

"We used to fight over just about everything, huh? Natsuru Takahashi and Yui Ayanami, the friendliest rivals you'd ever meet." Natsuru smiled as she glanced over towards a photo on a nearby mantelpiece, portraying their graduation memory.  
“我们过去几乎为每件事争吵，对吧？Natsuru Takahashi 和 Yui Ayanami，你见过的最友好的对手。” Natsuru 微笑着瞥向附近壁炉架上的一张照片，那是她们毕业时的留影。

Yui was standing next to a smiling Gendo, holding her hand out in a cheesy peace sign, complete with a goofy grin, whilst Natsuru hung off the neck of her soon to be husband.  
Yui 站在微笑的 Gendo 旁边，伸出手做着俗气的和平手势，脸上挂着傻笑，而 Natsuru 则搂着她即将成为丈夫的脖子。

"I guess at some point we became 'Kirishima' and 'Ikari', but otherwise, not much has changed, has it?"  
"我想在某个时刻我们变成了'桐岛'和'碇'，但除此之外，变化不大，对吧？"

"Apart from you becoming a hermit mangaka and me going into mad science as our chosen professions." Yui pointed out cheekily.  
"除了你成了隐居的漫画家，而我选择了疯狂科学家的职业。" 优衣俏皮地指出。"

"Hey, you can't call the author of your beloved series a hermit!"  
"嘿，你不能把你心爱的系列的作者称为隐士！"

"Speaking of which, hurry up and finish the next volume! I could have killed you for leaving the last book on a cliffhanger!"  
"说到这个，快点把下一卷写完！上一本书留了个悬念，我差点想杀了你！"

"Haha, I'm sorry! It was a necessary evil, but..." Going over to her desk, Natsuru picked up a book and brought it over to Yui.  
"哈哈，对不起！那是必要的恶，不过..." 走到她的书桌旁，夏树拿起一本书，递给了优衣。"

"It's not supposed to be on sale until the day after tomorrow but consider this a promotional copy." She grinned as she thrust the sequel to her series into a stunned Yui's hands.  
"这书原本后天才开始发售，但你就当这是提前的宣传版吧。" 她笑着将系列续集塞进目瞪口呆的唯手中。

"D-d you mean it? Are you serious?"  
"你-你是认真的吗？你是说真的？"

"It's the least I can do for my biggest fan, especially as you've given me an even more precious treasure all these years."  
"这是我能为我的头号粉丝做的最起码的事，尤其是这些年你给了我更加珍贵的宝藏。"

"What have I given you that even compares to this?" A stunned Yui asked.  
"我给了你什么能与这个相比的？" 震惊的唯问道。

Natsuru smiled fondly as she turned to the two playing children in her front room.  
夏树微笑着转向她前厅里玩耍的两个孩子，眼中满是宠溺。

"You gave my daughter her very first and most treasured friend."  
"你给了我的女儿她人生中的第一个也是最珍爱的朋友。"

---

Half an hour passed by, with the adults lost in reminiscing the past. Whilst the adults were busy, Mana had gone to her room and brought some toys back.  
半小时过去了，大人们沉浸在往昔的回忆中。与此同时，大人们忙碌时，真奈已经回到自己的房间，带回了一些玩具。

"Shinji, let's play with these next!"  
"新司，我们接下来玩这些吧！"

Mana had brought four robot-looking objects with her, each a different colour, and with an individual number on them.  
Mana 带来了四个机器人模样的物体，每个都是不同的颜色，并且各自带有一个编号。

A white model with two zero's. A purple-green model with zero-one. A red model with zero-two and the last was a mix of black and dark blue, with zero-four embellished on it.  
一个白色模型，上面有两个零。一个紫绿色的模型，编号是零一。一个红色模型，编号零二，最后一个是黑色和深蓝色的混合，上面装饰着零四。

Looking at them, Shinji felt a little scared by their intimidating forms. Even if they were only the size of his forearm.  
看着它们，Shinji 感到有些害怕，它们的威严形态令人心生敬畏。尽管它们的尺寸只有他的前臂那么大。

"W-what are they?" "这-这是什么？"

"They're called Evangelions!"  
"它们被称为福音战士！"

"E-evan... gelions?" “伊文……杰里昂？”

"Yeah!" Mana stood up and thrust her chest out proudly. "I'm writing a book, with a little bit of Mama's help, and these super-cool Evangelions save the world in it!"  
“耶！”玛娜站起来，自豪地挺起胸膛。“我在写一本书，有妈妈的一点帮助，书里这些超酷的福音战士拯救了世界！”

"I designed them, and Mama did some magic with the 3D printer, after she fixed some of my scribbles, and they came out looking awesome, don't you think?!"  
“我设计的，妈妈用 3D 打印机施了点魔法，她修正了我的一些涂鸦，结果它们看起来超棒，你不觉得吗？！”

Shinji sat in awe as he watched Mana explain her somewhat roundabout plot about evil Angels attacking humanity, and how kids had to get into these robots to fight them and save the world. As he listened, he began to feel less intimidated by them.  
真嗣坐在那里，惊叹地看着玛娜解释她那略显曲折的情节，关于邪恶的天使如何攻击人类，以及孩子们如何必须进入这些机器人中与它们战斗并拯救世界。听着听着，他开始感到不那么害怕了。

"They sound so cool!" Mana giggled as she heard his enthusiastic approval.  
"听起来真酷！" Mana 咯咯笑着，听到他热情的赞同。

"Well then... How would you like to be the pilot of Unit One?"  
"那么...你想成为初号机的驾驶员吗？"

"W-what?" "什-什么？"

"I'll write you into the story! You'll be the one who saves the world, whilst rescuing me from a nasty Angel! And then everyone can party, and be happy ever after!"  
"我会把你写进故事里！你将成为那个拯救世界的人，同时从邪恶的天使手中救出我！然后大家就可以开派对，从此幸福快乐地生活下去！"

As Shinji cheered along with Mana, Yui suddenly gasped from the table as she looked at her watch.  
当真嗣和玛娜一起欢呼时，坐在桌边的唯突然看着手表倒吸了一口气。

"Is that the time!? I gotta go, Gendo is going to kill me!" She quickly stood up as she gathered her things. "Thanks for the coffee Natsuru!" She turned back as she ran to the front door.  
"已经这个时间了！？我得走了，源堂会杀了我的！" 她迅速站起身来收拾东西。"谢谢你的咖啡，夏树！" 她转身向门口跑去。

"Shinji, make sure you behave! And no playing doctor or anything silly, you hear me!"  
"真嗣，你要乖乖的！不许玩什么医生游戏或者任何傻事，听到了吗！"

"Yes mama..." Shinji mumbled sheepishly at his embarrassing mother.  
"知道了，妈妈……" 真嗣尴尬地低声回应着令人难堪的母亲。

"Thanks for looking after him Natsuru!" Yui said as she fumbled with her shoes at the entrance.  
"谢谢你照顾他，夏树！" 优衣在门口手忙脚乱地穿鞋时说道。

"It's no problem at all Yui! Be safe!" Natsuru giggled as she watched her friend scamper. "Dear god, she can be so scatterbrained sometimes."  
"一点儿也不麻烦，优衣！路上小心！" 夏树咯咯笑着，看着她的朋友匆匆离去。"天哪，她有时候真是丢三落四的。"

---

"I love my wife, but dear god she sure knows how to keep a man waiting." Gendo mumbled from his desk. A familiar woman was standing behind him, holding a clipboard and going through her notes, whilst trying not to giggle and failing.  
"我爱我的妻子，但天哪，她确实知道如何让一个男人等待。" 源堂从书桌旁咕哝道。一个熟悉的女人站在他身后，拿着剪贴板，翻阅着笔记，同时尽量忍住不笑，却失败了。

"I'm sure she got caught up in her memories of the past with her friend. They barely get to meet these days, you can't be too hard on her."  
"我敢肯定她陷入了与朋友的过去回忆中。他们最近很少见面，你不能对她太苛刻。"

"That's fine and all Dr. Soryu, but humanity isn't going to save itself and this research seems to be the key to our survival. Which is going nowhere, fast!"  
"话虽如此，草薰博士，但人类不会自救，这项研究似乎是我们生存的关键。但现在进展缓慢，毫无头绪！"

"Relax. Humanity has pulled through worse scrapes before, we can do it again. And this research will be ready in time, I can guarantee it." Dr. Kyoko Soryu smiled softly. If not for her, then she would make sure the future was safe for her child. Her precious little Asuka.  
"放松点。人类以前经历过更糟糕的困境，我们能再次挺过去。这项研究会及时完成的，我保证。"" 草薰响子博士温柔地笑了。如果不是为了她自己，那么她也会确保她孩子的未来是安全的。她珍爱的宝贝明日香。"

"Yeah, but...!" Gendo jumped as Yui suddenly scrambled into existence behind him, wheezing.  
"是啊，但是...！" 源堂吓了一跳，因为唯突然气喘吁吁地出现在他身后。

"Sorry... Late... Natsuru... Bleargh, I'msounfit." Yui caught her breath and stood up.  
"对不起...迟到了...夏树...呃，我太不健康了。" 唯喘过气来，站直了身子。

"At some point, we are going to a gym and sorting out our cardio, Gendo."  
"总有一天，我们要去健身房，好好锻炼一下心肺功能，源堂。"

"We have a gym though..."  
"我们这里不是有健身房吗……"

"Since when?!" "什么时候的事？！"

"Since you designed the majority of the architecture of this place. I seem to remember you saying something along the lines of, "We may be super-genius scientists, but we also need to keep our health at its optimal levels." Gendo sighed. "You do remember we have like a swimming pool and an indoor hot spring on the base too, right?"  
"自从你设计了这里的大部分建筑结构。我记得你好像说过类似这样的话，“我们虽然是超级天才科学家，但也需要保持最佳健康状态。”碇源堂叹了口气。“你别忘了，基地里还有游泳池和室内温泉吧？”

Yui's shocked face was a sight to behold, causing Kyoko to giggle once again.  
优依震惊的表情颇为引人注目，让京子再次忍不住笑出声来。

"But enough about the facilities, _which I can see your absolutely dying to try now that you've remembered about them_. We have a job to do."  
“不过设施的事就说到这儿吧，看你那样子，现在肯定迫不及待想试试了。我们还有任务要完成呢。”

"You're such a party pooper Gendo..." Yui pouted as she sat down at her desk, firing up her computer whilst watching her gloomy expression on the monitor's reflection.  
"你真是扫兴，源堂..." 唯噘着嘴坐在桌前，启动电脑的同时通过屏幕的反射观察着他阴沉的表情。

"Don't fret Yui, we can enjoy the indoor baths together if you'd like?" Kyoko said as she sat down next to the depressed Ikari.  
"别担心，唯，如果你愿意的话，我们可以一起去享受室内温泉。" 京子说着，坐在了情绪低落的碇旁边。

"I'm gonna hold you to that." Yui typed in her login with practiced ease as she slid a sidelong look to the blond doctor.  
"我可记住你这话了。" 唯熟练地输入登录信息，同时斜眼瞥了一眼金发的医生。

"By the way, how's Shinji doing?"  
“对了，真嗣最近怎么样？”

"He's okay. I left him having fun with Mana, and he was all smiles and giggles when I was leaving."  
他没事。我离开时他正和玛娜玩得开心，满脸笑容和欢笑。

"Oh my! Asuka won't be too happy when she hears that. All that girl ever talks about is Shinji, and when will she get to play with him again."  
"哎呀！明日香听到这个可不会太高兴。那女孩整天念叨的就是真嗣，什么时候才能再和他一起玩呢。"

"I feel like Shinji's going to grow up with no clue how to deal with them when they start fighting over him." Yui laughed. "At least I know he's going to have two beautiful girls fighting over him when they get older."  
"我觉得真嗣长大后肯定不知道怎么应付她们争风吃醋。"" 绫笑了。""至少我知道，他将来会有两位美丽的女孩为他争风吃醋。"

"Three." Gendo mumbled behind his clasped hands. "It seems he has bonded very quickly with Rei as well."  
"三个。"" 源堂在双手交握的背后咕哝道。""看来他和丽也很快建立了深厚的感情。"

"He's not even ten years old and he's already set-up with his own harem."  
他还不满十岁，就已经有自己的后宫了。

"I didn't plan it that way Kyoko!" Yui groaned, suddenly realizing she may have inadvertently made Shinji's teenage years a living hell before they had even begun.  
"我没想到会变成这样，绫子！" 优叹息道，突然意识到自己可能无意中让真嗣的青春期变成了活生生的地狱，而这一切甚至还没开始。

"I have faith my little Asuka will be the one to steal his heart away, like the little phantom thief she is." Kyoko grinned. "I'm looking forward to the day they bring me a grandchild."  
"我相信我的小明日香会偷走他的心，就像她那小怪盗一样。" 绫子咧嘴笑道，"我期待着他们带给我一个孙子的那一天。"

"_They're not even out of grade school yet Kyoko..._" Yui thought to herself, grimacing at the prospect that she'll be a fair bit older when that time did eventually come around.  
"他们还没小学毕业呢，绫子..." 优心里想着，一想到那一天真的到来时自己会老不少，不禁皱起了眉头。

---

Several hours passed by with the three scientists making good progress on the day's work. When break time finally rolled around, Yui decided her system was in a severe lack of caffeine and made her way to the canteen.  
几个小时过去了，三位科学家在当天的工作中取得了良好的进展。当休息时间终于到来时，Yui 觉得她的系统严重缺乏咖啡因，便向食堂走去。

"I mean, I'm looking forward to kids too. But definitely still too early to be thinking of them now... right?" Yui said to herself, whilst simultaneously imagining what the kids would look like, depending on who Shinji eventually chose. The kettle was bubbling away happily as Yui switched on the television.  
"我的意思是，我也期待有孩子。但肯定现在想这些还太早了...对吧？" 优一边自言自语，一边同时想象着孩子们会是什么样子，这取决于真嗣最终选择了谁。水壶正愉快地冒着泡，优打开了电视。

She made her coffee quickly, and was enjoying its aromatic flavour just as the afternoon news flickered on.  
她迅速冲好咖啡，正享受着它那芳香的滋味，午间新闻的画面闪烁起来。

_"Breaking news! As of 2.30pm this afternoon, a level nine earthquake has decimated a residential area in Tokyo-3's fourth district. Substantial damage has been caused to many of the buildings in the area, with many feared dead. There is currently no news on potential fatalities-..."  
"突发新闻！今天下午 2 点 30 分，东京-3 第四区发生了一场九级地震，摧毁了一个居民区。该地区的许多建筑物遭受了严重破坏，许多人恐已遇难。目前尚无关于潜在伤亡的消息-..."_

_CRASH_

The coffee cup went flying, destroying itself all over the canteen floor as Yui ran back to the lab as fast as she could. The footage on the news had shown the area that Yui had been at only a few hours beforehand.  
咖啡杯飞了出去，在食堂地板上摔得粉碎，而结衣则以最快的速度跑回实验室。新闻中的画面显示的正是几个小时前结衣所在的地方。

And she saw something else. A sight that had sent every nerve in her body into meltdown.  
而她看到了别的东西。一个景象，让她的每根神经都陷入了崩溃。

Her best friends apartment block, in ruins.  
她最好朋友的公寓楼，已成废墟。

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

### Chapter 8: Did You Forget About Fate?  
第八章：你忘了命运吗？  

The district was utterly destroyed.  
这片区域被彻底摧毁了。

Yui should have been hearing the deafening rush of the helicopter's propeller blades, but all she couldn't hear a thing. Just a ringing numbness that threatened to crush her very soul.  
优衣本该听到直升机螺旋桨震耳欲聋的轰鸣，但她却什么也听不见。只有一阵阵刺耳的耳鸣，仿佛要将她的灵魂碾碎。

The pilot took the broken scientist and her husband down to ground level. She could vaguely hear Gendo and the pilot yelling at each other over the sounds of the flying vehicle. Something about the building still being unstable or something.  
飞行员带着受伤的科学家和她丈夫降落到地面。她隐约能听到源堂和飞行员在飞行器的噪音中互相吼叫。似乎是关于建筑仍然不稳定之类的事情。

But she didn't care. 但她不在乎。

She had to find them. She had to find Shinji.  
她必须找到他们。她必须找到真嗣。

As soon as they were close enough to the ground, Yui jumped out, closely followed by a rarely-seen, utterly panicked Gendo.  
当他们离地面足够近时，Yui 跳了出去，紧随其后的是难得一见、完全惊慌失措的 Gendo。

"YUI! DON'T GO NEAR, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!"  
“YUI！别靠近，太危险了！”

But she couldn't hear him. She couldn't hear anything anymore.  
但她听不见他的声音。她再也听不到任何声音了。

Only the sounds of a soul-destroying numbness.  
只有灵魂毁灭般的麻木声响。

"S-shin...ji..." “新...二...”

It was dark. Cold. And he was sure he was inhaling more dust than air by now.  
四周一片黑暗。寒冷。他确信自己吸入的灰尘比空气还多。

"Shin...ji..." "真...嗣..."

Who was that? Who kept calling his name?  
那是谁？谁一直在呼唤他的名字？

"Shinji... p-please... I need you to... wake up..." He felt something grab his hand. It was warm, but seemed to be getting colder and colder.  
"真嗣...请...我需要你...醒来..."他感觉到有什么握住了他的手。那温暖，却似乎越来越冷。

"Shinji..." He definitely knew that voice. His head was ringing. But there could have been a full-scale orchestra deafening his ability to think and he'd recognize that voice anywhere.  
“真嗣……”他绝对认得这个声音。他的脑袋嗡嗡作响。但即便有一整支管弦乐队在震耳欲聋地干扰他的思考，他也能在任何地方辨认出那个声音。

"Please... save me..." “请……救救我……”

His eyes shot open, only to be met by darkness. Only a sliver of light trickled through a tiny gap in the debris of what had been Mana's living room. Turning to his side, he saw whatever had been holding his hand had indeed been Mana.  
他的眼睛猛地睁开，却只见到一片黑暗。只有一丝光线透过曾是玛娜客厅的废墟中的一个小缝隙透进来。他侧过身去，发现握着他手的确实是玛娜。

Bloodied, bruised, but well and truly alive.  
血迹斑斑，伤痕累累，但确确实实还活着。

They were trapped under the table. Mana's mother had thrown them both under the table the second the earthquake sirens started going off, and the terrifying shaking had started.  
他们被困在桌子底下。地震警报一响起，Mana 的母亲立刻将他们俩推到桌子下，随即开始了令人恐惧的摇晃。

Grabbing her blood-drenched hand, he squeezed it tightly.  
他紧紧握住她沾满鲜血的手。

"It's okay Mana... we're gonna be _*cough*_ ...be okay..."  
"没事的，Mana... 我们会... *咳嗽* ...会没事的..."

She nodded, providing a little sound in agreement. They were going to make it.  
她点点头，发出轻微的同意声。他们一定能挺过去的。

Trying to sit up was an incredible effort, but somehow he made it into a sitting position, and tried looking around him.  
试图坐起来需要极大的努力，但他还是设法坐直了身子，并尝试环顾四周。

He sorely wished he hadn't.  
他真希望自己没这么做。

From their position under the table, he could see blood trickling over the side. Along with a hand poking over the edge. Trembling in utter fright, Shinji gently crawled out from under the table, stood up, and looked back.  
从桌子底下的位置，他可以看到血正沿着边缘滴落。还有一只手从边缘伸出来。因极度恐惧而颤抖着，真嗣小心翼翼地从桌子底下爬出来，站起身，回头看去。

No six-year-old should have had to have seen it. Not many adults would have had the stomach to look at something like that.  
没有一个六岁的孩子应该看到这样的场景。没有多少成年人能承受看到这样的东西。

But Shinji Ikari saw the unmistakeable sight of Natsuru Kirishima lying on the table, skewered by what looked like a fallen girder from the destroyed ceiling, straight through the torso. By some miracle, it hadn't penetrated through the table. They had been saved, but...  
但碇真嗣看到了不容置疑的一幕：夏树红白躺在桌上，被一根看似是从毁坏的天花板上掉落的横梁贯穿了躯干。奇迹般地，它并没有穿透桌子。他们得救了，但是……

"ahh...uuhh..." He could feel his mind, his sanity evaporating. He wanted to cry, he wanted to scream, he was so close to losing his mind...  
“啊……呃……”他感觉到自己的理智正在蒸发。他想哭，他想尖叫，他几乎要失去理智……

"S-shinji... is... everything... alright?"  
“真……真嗣……一……一切都还好吗？”

She couldn't know. She can't know. She can't see this.  
她不可能知道。她不能知道。她不能看到这个。

"E-everything's o-o-o-okay... Mana..." His voice was cracking, he was on the knife's edge of retaining his senses.  
"一-一切都-还-还-还好...麻奈..." 他的声音在颤抖，他正处于保持理智的边缘。

"That's... good..." Mana looked up at the clearly shaken boy.  
"那...那就好..." 麻奈抬头看着明显受到惊吓的男孩。

"Where's Mama?" “妈妈在哪里？”

The terror had upgraded to an apocalyptic version of panic. He could feel the crescendo of extreme stress building on top of what was already an uncontainable meltdown.  
恐惧已升级为世界末日般的恐慌。他能感受到极度压力的高潮正在叠加，原本已是无法控制的崩溃。

"She...s-she... I don't know... I can't see...her..." If Mana could see the reflection in his eyes, of what he could see right now, of Natsuru Kirishima's torn body, her blood soaking into her hair, turning it into an even deeper shade of crimson, her limbs splayed in weird angles...  
“她...她...我不知道...我看不见...她...”如果麻奈能看到他眼中的倒影，那他现在所见，夏目奈津的残破身躯，鲜血浸透了她的头发，染成更深的猩红，四肢以怪异的角度散开...

He didn't think Mana could ever recover from that.  
他没想到 Mana 能从那件事中恢复过来。

"We...we need to get out of here..." Shinji bent under the table, trying his hardest to put on a brave face. "We need to find an exit, and make sure we tell people we're okay."  
“我们...我们需要离开这里...” 真嗣蜷缩在桌子下，竭尽全力装出勇敢的样子。“我们需要找到出口，并确保告诉人们我们没事。”

"...but Mama..." “...但是妈妈...”

"Please Mana... Yo-you're hurt... we need to get you to a doctor right away!"  
"求你了，Mana... 你受伤了... 我们得马上送你去看医生！"

"I can't move Shinji..." "我动不了，真嗣..."

It appeared Mana had both her legs broken. Anytime she tried putting movement into them, the pain was enough to make her scream in agony.  
看来 Mana 的双腿都骨折了。每当她试图移动它们时，剧痛足以让她痛苦地尖叫。

He would never forget those screams. It was like they had been etched into his very soul.  
他永远不会忘记那些尖叫声。仿佛它们已深深烙印在他的灵魂深处。

"SHINJI! IT HURTS... IT HURTS SO MUCH..." Mana began bawling, thumping the ground in front of her with her tiny fists. Tears were flooding down her face as she looked up to the terrified Shinji.  
"真嗣！好痛...好痛啊..." 玛娜开始嚎啕大哭，用她的小拳头猛捶着面前的地面。泪水如泉涌般顺着她的脸颊流下，她抬头望向惊恐的真嗣。

"I'll... I'll save you!" After explaining that it was going to hurt, Shinji managed to pull the broken Mana from out under the table. She was is no fit state to look around her, and eventually, it looked like the pain was getting to her.  
"我会...我会救你的！"在解释说这会很痛之后，真嗣设法将受伤的麻奈从桌子底下拉了出来。她现在的状态根本无法环顾四周，最终，看起来疼痛正在加剧。

"Shinji... please... save me." As Mana lapsed into unconsciousness, he began to panic again.  
"真嗣...请...救救我。"随着麻奈陷入昏迷，他又开始慌乱起来。

"Don't! D-d-d-don't die Mana... please!" He began sobbing as he watched the little girl's eyes closed. But he quickly noticed that she was still breathing.  
"不要！别...别死，麻奈...求你了！"他看着小女孩闭上眼睛，开始抽泣。但他很快注意到她仍在呼吸。

Lifting the sleeping girl in his arms, he took one last look back at the corpse of the woman who had looked after him. Who had saved his life. And cried.  
他抱起熟睡的女孩，最后一次回头看向那位照顾他、救了他性命的女人的尸体。泪水滑落。

He was still crying as he somehow made his way out of Mana's miraculously still-standing front door.  
当他设法走出玛娜奇迹般依旧屹立的前门时，泪水仍在他的脸颊上流淌。

The first thing he noticed was the setting sun, illuminating the wreckage from the outside. The stairwell going downstairs was also destroyed. Wiping his face on the top of his arm, his expression changed to that of pure determination. He needed to save his friend!  
他首先注意到的是夕阳，它从外部照亮了废墟。通往楼下的楼梯也已被摧毁。他用手臂擦去脸上的泪水，表情变得坚定无比。他必须救他的朋友！

After ten agonizing minutes of carrying a fairly heavy Mana, he had managed to make it to the roof of the apartment block. He was only six, he wasn't designed to carry anything heavier than a teacup at his age.  
经过十分钟痛苦的挣扎，他终于将相当沉重的玛娜搬到了公寓楼的屋顶。他才六岁，按理说这个年纪连比茶杯重的东西都不该拿。

Collapsing on his knees, he noticed helicopters buzzing around. Holding the injured Mana close to him, he took in as much air as he could in a single breath. And screamed as loud as he could to the world.  
他双膝一软跪倒在地，注意到直升机在四周盘旋。他紧紧抱住受伤的玛娜，深吸一口气，然后对着世界竭尽全力地尖叫起来。

"MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"  
“妈咪啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！”

---

"I would never forget that."  
"我永远不会忘记那件事。"

A determined Shinji responded. Mana gently smiled.  
真嗣坚定地回答。麻奈温柔地笑了。

"Me too." "我也是。"

An awkward silence filled the room, broken only by Mana shifting uncomfortably on her chair, the chains on her hands rattling, the sound reverberating around the room.  
房间里弥漫着尴尬的沉默，只有玛娜在椅子上不安地挪动，手上的链条叮当作响，声音在房间里回荡。

"Have you ever heard of Seele?"  
“你听说过 Seele 吗？”

Shaking his head, he must of looked as confused as he felt. Who were Seele?  
他摇了摇头，看起来一定和他感觉一样困惑。Seele 是谁？

"They're an organization. They research things similar to what your parents are doing. But to be perfectly honest, they're stealing your parents ideas and trying to take over humanity."  
他们是一个组织。他们研究的东西和你父母正在做的类似。但老实说，他们在窃取你父母的想法，并试图接管人类。

She couldn't look at his perplexed gaze.  
她无法直视他那困惑的眼神。

"After... after my mom died, a lot of things happened. My father... committed suicide. He couldn't take the grief of what happened and just... disappeared. Not long after that, I found myself in an orphanage."  
"在我妈妈去世后，发生了许多事情。我父亲...选择了自杀。他无法承受所发生的一切带来的悲痛，就这样...消失了。不久之后，我发现自己被送进了孤儿院。"

"I remember the orphanage, but you never mentioned your father died!" He was taken aback by the new information. He had been aware that her father had passed away somehow, but... suicide?  
"我记得那家孤儿院，但你从未提过你父亲是自杀的！" 他对这个新信息感到震惊。他知道她的父亲以某种方式去世了，但...自杀？

"I was so thankful that you came to visit me at that orphanage Shinji. I think I would have met a similar fate, had I been left all alone."  
"我很感激你那时来孤儿院看我，真嗣。我想如果我一个人被留下，我可能也会遭遇类似的命运。"

"Was that why...?" He couldn't voice the remainder of that thought. At the orphanage, Mana had never played with any of the other kids, but every time his parents had brought him over to play with her, she would turn into a hyperactively ecstatic crazy child. Over time, her affection got more and more intense, but he still came to play with her as often as he could. Some of the games they would play had left him more than a little traumatized though.  
"那是为什么...？" 他无法说出那个想法的其余部分。在孤儿院，Mana 从未和其他孩子玩耍，但每次父母带他去找她玩时，她就会变成一个极度兴奋的疯狂孩子。随着时间的推移，她的感情越来越强烈，但他仍然尽可能频繁地去找她玩。尽管如此，他们玩的一些游戏还是让他留下了不少心理阴影。

"You were the only one I could talk to. You almost died that same day I had. When Mama... did." Mana sniffled, a single tear falling down her face. "So I had to latch on. I had to keep you close. Or I'd be all alone..."  
"你是唯一能和我说话的人。就在我那天差点死去的时候，你也差点死了。当妈妈...去世的时候。" Mana 抽泣着，一滴眼泪从她的脸颊滑落。"所以我必须紧紧抓住你。我必须让你靠近我。否则我就会孤身一人..."

More tears began to fall. Mana was silently crying in front of him. He had no idea what to do.  
更多的泪水开始滑落。麻奈在他面前默默哭泣。他完全不知道该怎么办。

"I read something in a book once. _'Loneliness is a disease that can easily lead to death.'_ " She looked up at him, her cerulean eyes red from crying. "You saved me twice back then. Once from the earthquake. And once again. From myself."  
“我曾在书上读到过一句话，‘孤独是一种极易导致死亡的疾病。’”她抬头望着他，湛蓝的眼眸因哭泣而泛红。“那时你救了我两次。一次是从地震中。再一次，是从我自己手中。”

Her crying had escalated. Mana was full-on bawling her eyes out. Shinji felt numb just imagining what she had gone through back then. So he did the only thing he could think to do.  
她的哭泣愈演愈烈。麻奈已经哭得泪眼婆娑。真嗣只是想象她当时经历的一切就感到麻木。于是他做了唯一能想到的事情。

He placed his arms around her, and hugged her tightly. And Mana continued to cry into his shoulder.  
他伸出双臂环绕着她，紧紧地拥抱。而玛娜继续在他的肩头哭泣。

"Please don't leave me. Don't leave me again. You're the only one keeping me sane right now. You're... my entire reason for living right now."  
“请不要离开我。不要再离开我了。现在只有你能让我保持理智。你……是我此刻活下去的全部理由。”

"I won't leave you again. I'll do whatever it takes to stay close to you Mana."  
“我不会再离开你了。我会尽一切努力留在你身边，玛娜。”

"You gotta promise me! Before those Seele bastards take me away from you again."  
“你得答应我！在他们那些 Seele 混蛋再次把我从你身边带走之前。”

"I won't let them." "我不会让他们得逞的。"

"But you have no idea Shinji! These guys... they're insanely powerful. They took me away from that orphanage, trained me to be a spy, and... and..." She started to cry again, wetting his shirt to the point where he was starting to think he needn't bother wearing it anymore.  
"可是你不知道，真嗣！这些人...他们强大得不可思议。他们把我从孤儿院带走，训练我成为间谍，而且...而且..." 她再次哭泣起来，泪水浸湿了他的衬衫，以至于他开始觉得或许不必再穿它了。

_*Click*  *咔嚓*_

"W-what're you doing?" “你、你在干什么？”

Shinji pulled back a little, dangling Mana's handcuff keys in front of her. Her cuffs fell to the ground with a loud clang.  
真嗣稍稍后退，将手铐钥匙在麻那面前晃了晃。她的手铐应声落地，发出一声响亮的哐当声。

"I trust you Mana. I trust every word you say." His eyes were full of a kind determination. His smile was infectious, causing Mana to smile through her tear-ridden visage.  
“我相信你，麻那。我相信你说的每一句话。”他的眼中充满了坚定的决心。他的笑容极具感染力，让麻那泪眼朦胧的脸上也露出了微笑。

"We'll protect you. Just tell everyone what you were telling me, and we can start again, wipe the slate clean. And protect humanity from this... Seele. We need your help Mana." Shinji held out his hand.  
"我们会保护你。只需告诉大家你刚才告诉我的那些，我们就能重新开始，洗清一切。并保护人类免受这个...Seele 的威胁。我们需要你的帮助，Mana。" 真嗣伸出了手。

"Will you help us?" "你会帮助我们吗？"

Ignoring his hand completely, Mana leapt from her chair and tackled Shinji to the ground with a tight bearhug. Crying again, she snuggled into his chest as Shinji ruffled her hair, chuckling to himself.  
完全无视他的手，Mana 从椅子上跳起来，紧紧地用熊抱将 Shinji 扑倒在地。再次哭泣的她，依偎在他的胸前，而 Shinji 则轻揉她的头发，自顾自地轻笑。

"If its you... _*sniff *_ If its you Shinji. I'll do anything. Just stay by my side. Forever."  
“如果是你... *抽泣* 如果是你 Shinji。我什么都愿意做。只要留在我身边。永远。”

They stayed in that position for a long time. The CCTV cameras on the wall were silently watching them, being fed to the main control centre. If Shinji had any clue that Misato, his parents, the entire tech staff and Kyoko Soryu were all watching his 'moment', he might have died from embarrassment there and then.  
他们就这样保持了很久。墙上的监控摄像头默默地注视着他们，画面被传送到主控中心。如果 Shinji 知道 Misato、他的父母、全体技术人员以及 Kyoko Soryu 都在观看他的‘时刻’，他可能会当场羞愧而死。

"...He gets that from you dear."  
"...他这点是遗传你的，亲爱的。"

"What do you mean Yui!? I'd never do something..."  
"你什么意思，唯！我绝不会做那种事..."

"First year of grad school, when I was convinced I was going to fail at life, a certain someone came into my dorm room and gave me a hug very similar to what I'm seeing right now-..."  
"研一那年，我以为自己要一事无成，某个特别的人走进我的宿舍，给了我一个拥抱，和现在看到的这个非常相似-..."

"**OKAY**, okay, enough of that."  
“好了，好了，到此为止。”

"I never knew you and your son had such ways with women Gendo."  
"我从来不知道你和你儿子在女人面前有这般手段，源堂。"

"Clam it Soryu!" Misato was laughing hysterically at the arguing adults. It was quickly replaced with an evil grin as she eyed a different monitor.  
"闭嘴，惣流！" 美里狂笑着看着争吵的大人们。她的目光很快被另一个监视器吸引，露出了邪恶的笑容。

"Hey guys. Should we warn Shinji now or should we just let that unfold?" She was pointing to the monitoring room with the bulletproof glass and microphone that Asuka and Rei had just returned to.  
"嘿，伙计们。我们应该现在警告真嗣，还是就让事情这样发展下去？" 她指着装有防弹玻璃和麦克风的监控室，那里刚刚返回了明日香和绫波。

"Let it happen Katsuragi."  
"让它发生吧，桂木。"

"Gendo! They might kill him!"  
"源堂！他们可能会杀了他！"

"And what, pray tell, are we supposed to do about it from here?" Yui grimaced at her husbands words. Turning back to the monitor, she put her hands together as though praying at a shrine.  
"那么，请问，我们接下来该怎么做呢？" 优对丈夫的话皱起了眉头。她转回监视器，双手合十，仿佛在神社前祈祷。

"We can pray real hard!"  
"我们可以真心诚意地祈祷！"

"SHINJI BAKAMORONASSHOLEJERFACE IKARI! WHAT IN THE NAME OF FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?"  
"真嗣，你这个混蛋！你在搞什么鬼！？"

"Once again, she started it... waitwait_WAIT ASUKA PUT DOWN THE BRACELET!_"  
又一次，她开始了……等等等等等等，明日香放下那条手链！

_Some say, if you work at the laboratory late at night, when nobody else is around, you can still hear the screams of Shinji Ikari reverberating around the building.  
有人说，如果你在深夜独自一人待在实验室里，四周空无一人时，仍能听见碇真嗣的尖叫声在整栋楼里回荡。_

---

"Oh yeah..." Misato opened the door to the apartment gingerly, perplexing Asuka, Rei and Shinji sitting on the couch, watching television.  
"哦，是啊..." 美里小心翼翼地打开公寓的门，让坐在沙发上看着电视的明日香、绫波和真嗣感到困惑。

"Are you going somewhere Misato?" Asuka piped up. "If you're going to the convenience store, can you pick me up some chips? I need something to munch."  
"美里，你要去哪儿吗？" 明日香插话道，"如果你要去便利店，能帮我带些薯片吗？我需要点东西嚼嚼。"

"Asuka, you can summon crisps now, or did you forget?"  
"明日香，你现在可以召唤薯片了，还是你忘了？"

"I thought you were the one getting all anal about the morals of summoning free crap Shinji?"  
"我以为你才是那个对召唤免费东西的道德问题斤斤计较的人呢，真嗣？"

"I still think you shouldn't. You'll have no room left for dinner!"  
"我还是觉得你不该这么做。你晚饭都没地方放了！"

*Ahem* Misato cleared her throat loudly. "I'm actually going to pick someone up."  
*咳咳* 美里大声清了清喉咙。 "我其实是去接个人。"

For some reason, she looked incredibly nervous. Something Shinji had spied immediately, and was reunited with the familiar feeling of dread in his stomach. This could not go well, whatever it was.  
出于某种原因，她看起来异常紧张。这让真嗣立刻察觉到了，随之而来的是胃里那熟悉的恐惧感。无论是什么事，情况都不会太好。

"Due to extenuating circumstances..." Misato pulled on her shoes by the front door faster than anyone had ever seen before. Except before she was going on a beer run or a pub crawl.  
"由于特殊情况..." 美里在门口迅速穿上鞋子，速度之快前所未见。除了她要去买啤酒或参加酒吧爬行活动的时候。

All three teenagers stood up, now finally beginning to realize what had Misato so spooked. All three raised their bracelets, and pointed them at the poor, terrified woman as she pressed the button to open the front door. The bracelets began to charge with a terrifying energy as Misato looked about ready to cry.  
三个少年都站了起来，终于开始意识到是什么让美里如此惊慌。三人举起手环，指向那位可怜、惊恐的女人，她正按下按钮打开前门。手环开始充能，散发出令人恐惧的能量，美里看起来几乎要哭了。

"_...it'sbeendecidedManaisgoingtolivewithusPLEASEDON'TKILLME!_" Misato screamed as she ran out of her house as the front door decided to choose that very moment to spontaneously explode.  
"...已经决定真奈会和我们一起住请不要杀我！" 美里尖叫着跑出家门，而前门恰好在那一刻自行爆炸了。

As soon as she was out of firing range, the three of them fixed the door, strengthened it to the point it could withstand a nuclear blast and unanimously decided that the girls would take turns keeping Shinji guarded that night, lest he get molested in his sleep by a certain crimson headed seductress.  
一脱离射程范围，三人便修好了门，加固到能抵御核爆的程度，并一致决定当晚由女孩们轮流守卫真嗣，以防那位红发妖姬趁他熟睡时对他图谋不轨。

### Chapter 9: After-School Shenanigans!  
第九章：放学后的恶作剧！  

Rei Ayanami was bored. 绫波零感到无聊。

One could say she had got very used to this state of mind, but in all actuality, nobody could get used to it. How do you enjoy boredom?  
可以说她已经非常习惯这种心态了，但实际上，没有人能习惯。你如何享受无聊呢？

Most people settled for daydreaming. Either becoming a hero piloting supergiant robots defeating evil aliens, or imagining various fantastical situations with that one person they felt a certain 'flutter' for.  
大多数人满足于白日梦。要么成为驾驶巨大机器人英雄击败邪恶外星人，要么想象与那个让他们心动的人的各种奇幻情景。

Who would've guessed that in her boredom, Rei Ayanami's eyes were occasionally flickering towards the boy she was more or less engaged to.  
谁能想到，在无聊之中，绫波零的目光偶尔会飘向那个她或多或少订了婚的男孩。

"...ei." "...零。"

But he hadn't yet given her a straight answer. Not that he could be blamed. The girl who had single-handedly almost destroyed the school was sitting on his left, somehow having ejected the previous occupant of that desk with little to no effort. Rei could only imagine how nervous Shinji was sitting next to the one girl in class who scared him more than Asuka.  
但他还没有给她一个直截了当的回答。这不能怪他。那个几乎单枪匹马差点毁了学校的女孩，不知怎么地，几乎没有费什么力气就把原来坐在他左边的人赶走了，现在正坐在那里。丽只能想象真嗣坐在班上唯一一个比明日香更让他害怕的女孩旁边有多紧张。

Most people were currently giving Mana Kirishima a wide berth after discovering her 'explosive' personality yesterday.  
大多数人现在都离真希波·真理·石川远远的，昨天发现了她那‘爆炸性’的性格之后。

"Rei..." “丽……”

But a strange feeling was beginning to bubble inside Rei's chest. What was it? It felt slightly... irritating.  
但一种奇怪的感觉开始在丽胸中涌动。这是什么？感觉有点...恼人。

"Earth to Miss Ayanami..."  
"地球呼叫绫波小姐..."

She often felt this strange emotion whenever she saw Asuka and Shinji together too. What in the world had her so... mad?  
每当看到明日香和真嗣在一起时，她也常常感到这种奇怪的情绪。到底是什么让她如此...生气？

"I get he's the current favorite for Mr. Tokyo-3, but I sort've need you to answer this question Rei..." Sighing deeply, Misato smiled at the lovestruck teenage girl. It's not like Misato couldn't see what was going through the young girl's mind. All you had to do was take one quick look at her face and it was obvious. Frowned expression, flushed face, what else could it be?  
"我知道他是目前第三新东京市的宠儿，但我需要你回答这个问题，绫波..." 深叹一口气，美里对着这位陷入爱河的少女微笑。美里并非看不出这年轻女孩的心思。只需快速瞥一眼她的脸，便一目了然。皱眉的表情，泛红的脸颊，还能是什么呢？

Walking over to Rei's desk, Misato stood there for a good thirty seconds, wondering if the girl would take any notice of her. The rest of the class was giggling at the apparently oblivious girl, but Rei kept glaring at Shinji, as though if she did for long enough, her angry gaze would laser it's way into his brain and burn him into turning around.  
美里走到绫波的课桌旁，站在那里足足三十秒，想知道女孩是否会注意到她。班上的其他同学都在窃笑这位显然心不在焉的女孩，但绫波依旧瞪着真嗣，仿佛只要她瞪得够久，她愤怒的目光就能像激光一样穿透他的大脑，迫使他转过身来。

"And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why most teachers get annoyed with teenage relationships. How are you supposed to be learning anything if..." Misato gently tapped the top of Rei's head with a rather heavy English dictionary. "...your mind is totally focused on love instead of the wonderful world of Shakespearean literature?"  
"女士们先生们，这就是为什么大多数老师对青少年恋情感到恼火的原因。如果你..." 美里轻轻地用一本相当厚重的英语词典敲了敲绫波的头顶。"...满脑子都是爱情而不是莎士比亚文学的奇妙世界，你该怎么学习呢？"

"Ow!" Rei, suddenly shocked out of her jealousy-fuelled reverie, sounded cute even when experiencing a jolt of pain. She looked up at Misato, the corner of her eyes watering, looking for all the world like Misato just kicked a puppy. "Why would you do that Sensei?"  
"哎哟！" 丽突然从嫉妒引发的沉思中惊醒，即便是在经历一阵疼痛时，她的声音听起来也很可爱。她抬头看着美里，眼角泛着泪光，看起来就像美里刚刚踢了一只小狗。"老师，你为什么要这么做？"

She could've felt regret for her actions, but instead, Misato grinned evilly at the confused looking girl.  
她本可以为自己的行为感到后悔，但相反，美里对那个困惑的女孩露出了邪恶的笑容。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

"Yes, Misa-... I mean, yes Sensei?"  
"是的，美里... 我是说，是的，老师？"

"It's your turn for clean-up duty after school today, is it not?"  
"今天轮到你放学后打扫卫生了，不是吗？"

"It is!? I thought it was Toji!?"  
"是吗！？我还以为是真嗣呢！"

"Toji, do you mind awfully swapping with Shinji for today? Rei's going to need some help after school, and I'm sure this will give you perfect opportunity to take Hikari out shopping or something."  
"真嗣，你介意今天和真希换一下吗？丽放学后需要一些帮助，我相信这会给你一个完美的机会带光去购物什么的。"

"SENSEI!" Both Toji and Hikari shouted out in surprise. One of them didn't sound too upset by it however.  
"老师！" 冬二和光同时惊讶地喊道。不过其中一人的声音听起来并不太沮丧。

"So it's decided. And now that you have at least an hour alone with him after school, do you mind awfully reading this passage out for me Rei?"  
"那么就这么定了。既然你现在放学后至少有一个小时单独和他在一起，你介意帮我读一下这段话吗，丽？"

A sly grin snaked its way onto Rei's face.  
丽脸上露出了狡黠的笑容。

"It would be my pleasure, Katsuragi-sensei."  
"非常荣幸，葛城老师。"

---

Asuka Langley Soryu was fuming.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷气得要命。

It wasn't like her regular irritated moods, she quite literally wanted to strangle people. Specifically, four people in particular.  
这不像她平时那种普通的烦躁情绪，她真的想掐死人。特别是，有四个人特别让她想这么做。

And after the events in English class, she realized that the last thing she wanted to happen was to allow that idiot Shinji to spend more than a minute alone in an empty classroom with the girl who was probably undressing him with her eyes earlier.  
而在英语课上的那些事后，她意识到她最不希望发生的事情就是让那个白痴真嗣和那个可能刚才一直在用眼神剥他衣服的女孩在空无一人的教室里独处超过一分钟。

Temporarily distracted with the idea of a slightly undressed Shinji, Asuka stomped her way to the classroom, face flushed.  
一想到稍微有些衣衫不整的真嗣，明日香就气呼呼地走向教室，脸颊泛红。

_I had him first! What the hell happened to my high-school romance!?  
明明是我先来的！我的高中浪漫史到底是怎么了！？_

---

The classroom was deadly silent. Apart from the various sounds of brooms, chalkboard erasers getting spanked and the occasional cough Rei would let out as chalk dust threatened to suffocate her.  
教室里死一般寂静。除了各种扫帚声、黑板擦被拍打的声音，还有偶尔在粉笔灰威胁下，丽会发出的咳嗽声。

_"I'm grateful to Katsuragi-sensei but..."_ Rei cast a sidelong glance at the boy who seemed to have overtaken most of her mental thinking capacity. _"What am I supposed to do now!?"_  
“我很感激桂木老师，但是……”丽斜眼瞥向那个似乎占据了大部分她思绪的男孩。“我现在该怎么办！？”

With her thoughts meandering on borderline panic, she continued to bash the erasers together, causing more dust to enter her breathing tubes. It didn't take long for Rei to get overcome with a spat of coughing.  
她的思绪在近乎恐慌的边缘徘徊，继续用力拍打黑板擦，更多的灰尘进入了她的呼吸道。没过多久，丽就被一阵咳嗽击倒了。

"Rei, you're doing it all wrong."  
"丽，你完全做错了。"

Out of nowhere, Shinji's hands had snaked their way around her, clasping her hands and forcing her to stop. Her coughing had subsided, but she suddenly felt feverish and even closer to a nervous breakdown.  
突然间，真嗣的手不知从何处伸了过来，环绕在她周围，握住她的手迫使她停下。她的咳嗽已经平息，但她突然感到一阵发烧，甚至更接近于崩溃的边缘。

"S-shinji!" "真-真嗣！"

"You're supposed to be doing it like this."  
“你应该这样做的。”

She wasn't even watching his hands. All that was on her mind right now was how close they were. She could feel his torso pressing up against her back, and she could have sworn she felt a heartbeat that was equally as stressed as hers was.  
她甚至没有看他的手。此刻她脑海中唯一的念头就是他们靠得有多近。她能感觉到他的胸膛紧贴着她的后背，她几乎可以肯定，那心跳与她一样紧张。

Was Shinji nervous? 真嗣他紧张吗？

_"I need to make sure..."_ The out-of-character thoughts were making sense to her now, but later on, she would wonder what was going on through her mind at the time as she leant in closer to him. She felt completely enveloped by him, and wanted nothing more than to make this moment last for as long as she could. Forever, if possible.  
"我需要确认一下..." 这些不合时宜的想法现在对她来说变得合理了，但后来她会疑惑当时自己的脑海里究竟在想些什么，因为她向他靠得更近了。她感到自己完全被他包围，只希望这一刻能尽可能长久地延续下去。如果可能的话，永远。

"A-are you alright Rei?" "丽，你还好吗？"

"I feel a little lightheaded. I think I inhaled too much dust."  
"我感觉有点头晕。我想我吸入了太多灰尘。"

"Do you wanna sit down for a moment?"  
"你想坐下来一会儿吗？"

"No. I'll be alright... Just..." She mustered as much courage as she could to slowly turn her head to meet his gaze. "Hold me like this... for a little longer."  
"不用了。我会没事的...只是..." 她鼓起所有勇气，缓缓转头迎上他的目光。"就这样抱着我...再久一点。"

He looked redder than the sun, and she could feel his nerves spasming throughout his body. He was just as nervous as she was.  
他看起来比太阳还要红，她能感觉到他的神经在他全身抽搐。他和她一样紧张。

But he also felt incredibly warm. And had a really nice scent of coconut and jojoba. Was that the type of shampoo he used?  
但他也感到无比温暖。还有一股椰子和荷荷巴的宜人香气。那是他用的洗发水类型吗？

Several minutes passed, with Rei enjoying the moment, and Shinji wondering if this was an appropriate time to pass out. His own thought process was malfunctioning, and he was seriously starting to wonder if Rei could feel the tightness in his pants as much as he could. He was really hoping she couldn't.  
几分钟过去了，丽享受着这一刻，而真嗣则在想这是否是昏倒的合适时机。他自己的思维已经紊乱，他开始认真怀疑丽是否能感受到他裤子里的紧绷感，就像他自己感受到的那样。他真的希望她感觉不到。

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

"Y-yes!?" “是、是的！？”

"How do you..." She shuffled uncomfortably against him, causing the poor teenage boy further skinship distress. It seemed like her sentence had got lost somewhere in her mind however, as she looked up at him again as she struggled to find her words.  
"你怎么..." 她在他身边不安地挪动，让这个可怜的少年更加不知所措。她的句子似乎在脑海中迷失了方向，因为她再次抬头看向他，努力寻找着合适的词语。

"...about me... howdoyou... I mean... oh, I sound so silly right now... Umm... give me a second..."  
"...关于我... 你怎么... 我是说... 哦，我现在听起来好傻... 嗯... 给我一点时间..."

Credit where it was due, even a faltering Rei sounded absolutely adorable to him right now. True, he didn't have much of a lid on his own haywire emotions himself right now but...  
该承认的还是要承认，即便雷的声音有些颤抖，此刻在他听来也绝对可爱至极。确实，他自己现在也难以控制那些乱七八糟的情绪，但是……

It was going to make for a really nice memory.  
这将是一个非常美好的回忆。

---

Asuka was ready to kill. She had been secretly eavesdropping on the rendezvous in the classroom for a while now, and was deciding whether to run in and break it up before things got too hot in there.  
明日香已经准备好大开杀戒了。她已经偷偷监听了教室里的会面好一阵子，正在考虑是否要冲进去阻止，以免事情变得无法收拾。

But before she could make up her mind, she jumped out of her skin as she felt somebody tap her on the shoulder.  
但还没等她下定决心，就吓得跳了起来，因为她感觉到有人拍了拍她的肩膀。

"JEEZUSMARYMOTHERAND- MANA!?"  
"天哪，玛丽妈妈和——玛娜！？"

"Ssssshhh!" Mana put her finger to her lips. "They're going to hear you!"  
"嘘——！" 玛娜将手指放在唇边。"他们会听到你的！"

"Why are you here!?" Asuka whispered through gritted teeth.  
“你为什么在这里？！”明日香咬牙切齿地低声问道。

"For the same reasons you are."  
“和你一样的原因。”

"I'm here to make sure idiot Shinji doesn't take advantage of the situation."  
“我来确保笨蛋真嗣不会趁机占便宜。”

"Then... so am I!" Mana had nothing but a cheesy grin to offer an already enraged Asuka.  
“那么...我也是！”玛娜除了一个尴尬的笑容，无法给已经怒火中烧的明日香任何安慰。

"It doesn't take two of us, go home!"  
"不需要我们俩都在这儿，回家吧！"

"I don't wanna. I want to be there to help pick up the pieces after Ayanami inevitably turns him down."  
"我不想去。我想在那之后帮忙收拾残局，毕竟绫波肯定会拒绝他。"

"I don't think that's happening anytime soon..." Asuka sighed. "You can see just as well as I can what's going on in there. And did we ever mention that Rei is basically engaged to him?"  
"我觉得这不会很快发生……" 明日香叹了口气。"你和我一样清楚里面发生了什么。而且我们有没有提过，绫波基本上已经和他订婚了？"

It was a thing of beauty to see the ever-chipper Mana looked shocked, but she couldn't revel in it's beauty for too long. Mana had stood up from their crouched postion outside of the slightly cracked open classroom door and was ready to crash the party.  
看到总是乐观的麻奈露出震惊的表情，真是美妙的一幕，但她不能沉浸在这美景中太久。麻奈已经从教室门外微微裂开的门缝中蹲着的位置站了起来，准备闯入聚会。

"What are you doing!?" Asuka grabbed the back of the girl's shirt as Mana tried opening the door.  
"你在干什么！？" 明日香抓住了女孩的衬衫后摆，而真奈正试图打开门。

"We have to stop them before it's too late!"  
"我们必须在他们来不及之前阻止他们！"

"Shinji is going to be pissed!"  
"真嗣会生气的！"

"I'm pissed!" "我气炸了！"

"So am I, but what if he starts hating you!"  
"我也是，但如果他开始讨厌你怎么办！"

The two girls continued to bicker outside the door. But one strong lunge forward from Mana, and both of them tumbled through the classroom together, giving both Shinji and Rei a more than unwelcome surprise.  
两个女孩在门外继续争吵。但 Mana 一个猛冲向前，两人一起跌进了教室，给 Shinji 和 Rei 带来了一个相当不受欢迎的惊喜。

"W-wha...! Asuka!? Mana!?"  
“什-什么...！Asuka！？Mana！？”

"I know you won't believe me if I told you this wasn't what it looks like, but at least believe me when I say she started it!" Asuka glared at Mana as both girls got up from the floor, looking sheepish.  
“我知道就算我说这不是看上去的那样你也不会相信，但至少相信我，是她先挑起的！”Asuka 瞪着 Mana，两个女孩从地板上站起来，看起来有些尴尬。

"I didn't start anything! I was on my way home when I saw a certain someone crouched in front of the door, looking suspicious!"  
"我什么都没开始！我正走在回家的路上，就看到某个人蹲在门前，看起来很可疑！"

"You traitorous sonofa-... _Rei? What are you doing?_"  
"你这个叛徒……丽？你在干什么？"

Electrical energy sparked around the enraged blue-haired girl as Shinji quickly backed away. He had seen this pattern often enough, and his instincts were all screaming at him to run. For good measure, he enveloped himself in his bracelet's shield first.  
愤怒的蓝发女孩周围电光闪烁，真嗣迅速后退。他对此情景已司空见惯，本能告诉他快跑。为了保险起见，他先给自己套上了手镯的护盾。

"**What are you doing here?**"  
"你在这里做什么？"

"SHE'S GONNA BLOW!" Asuka lifted her bracelet arm and covered herself with her own shield, as Mana followed suit.  
"她要爆炸了！" 明日香举起戴着手环的手臂，用自身的护盾保护自己，而真奈也紧随其后。

"Rei, calm down!" "丽，冷静下来！"

"I AM CALM SHINJI" He decided that Rei screaming at him wasn't as cute as Rei stuttering at him.  
"我冷静得很，真嗣。" 他觉得丽对他尖叫没有丽结巴着对他说话那么可爱。

"SHINJI DO SOMETHING SHE'S GOING TO KILL US!" Asuka screamed as the electrical rage coming from Rei was starting to poke holes into the classroom around them.  
“真嗣，快做点什么，她要杀了我们！” 明日香尖叫着，来自绫波的电气狂怒正开始在教室周围凿出孔洞。

"But what can I...?" He suddenly thought of something that might work, but it was risky. Not just now, but for the potential aftermath.  
“但我能做什么...？” 他突然想到一个可能奏效的办法，但风险很大。不仅是现在，还有可能的后果。

Leaping in front of Rei, Shinji stood with his arms out, his shield deactivated.  
真嗣跃到绫波面前，张开双臂，他的盾牌已关闭。

"**GET OUT OF MY WAY SHINJI!**"  
"让开，真嗣！"

"I'm sorry Rei. But I can certainly do this for you instead." Rushing forward before Rei had the chance to fire whatever attack she had charged up, he wrapped his arms around her own, took one quick glance at her suddenly shocked crimson eyes, and kissed her.  
"对不起，绫波。但我可以替你来做这件事。" 在绫波有机会发射她蓄力的攻击之前，他冲上前去，用双臂环抱住她的手臂，迅速瞥了一眼她突然震惊的深红眼睛，然后吻了她。

"_Why are girls lips so soft?_" He thought to himself, as he felt the supernatural energy in the room deflate faster than light. His eyes were closed, but Rei's were wide open in shock.  
"为什么女孩子的嘴唇这么柔软？" 他心中暗想，同时感觉到房间里的超自然能量以比光速还快的速度消散。他的眼睛闭着，但绫波的眼睛却震惊地睁得大大的。

"_He... what is he... Shinji..._" She closed her own eyes as she allowed Shinji to continue whatever he was doing. "_Thank you Shinji._"  
"他...他在做什么...真嗣..." 她闭上自己的眼睛，任由真嗣继续他的动作。"谢谢你，真嗣。"

A few minutes later, Rei was passed out on the ground, a happy grin plastered over her face as Shinji slowly backed away from the two, now incredibly angry females that had watched his daring move.  
几分钟后，丽已经昏倒在地，脸上挂着幸福的笑容，而真嗣则缓缓从那两位目睹了他大胆举动、此刻怒火中烧的女性身边退开。

"Y-you told me to do something and this was all I could think of to stop her!"  
"你让我做点什么，我只想到了这个办法来阻止她！"

"I DIDN'T MEAN A SMOOCH IDIOT! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?"  
"我不是让你亲她，你个笨蛋！你到底在想什么！？"

"I wasn't really thinking at all to be honest..."  
"说实话，我当时根本没怎么想……"

"I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT, IDIOT!"  
"我本可以告诉你的，白痴！"

"Asuka, calm down..." "明日香，冷静点..."

"I AM CALM, ASSHOLE!" "我很冷静，混蛋！"

"I think I deserve a kiss next. I could forgive you for that." Mana raised her hand as she giggled, jumping on the terrified Shinji.  
"我想我下次应该得到一个吻。我可以原谅你这一点。" 玛娜笑着举起手，跳向惊恐的 Shinji。

"OH NO YOU DON'T! I'VE WAITED FAR TOO LONG FOR YOU TO JUMP AHEAD."  
"哦不，你休想！我等了太久，你不能抢先。"

As Shinji suddenly found himself entangled between the two warring girls, part of his mind wondered what he should make for dinner that night.  
当真嗣突然发现自己夹在两个争吵的女孩之间时，他脑海中的一部分却在琢磨那晚该做些什么晚餐。

Fish sounded good. If only the smell of fish on his breath might stop his mouth getting molested as much as it had lately.  
吃鱼听起来不错。如果鱼腥味能阻止他的嘴像最近那样频繁被侵犯的话。

---

Her clock was telling her it was somewhere around two in the morning.  
她的时钟显示现在大概是凌晨两点左右。

Asuka hadn't had an easy time getting to sleep that night. Her mind was full of angry thoughts about what had happened earlier on that day.  
那天晚上，明日香睡个好觉可不容易。她的脑海里充满了对当天早些时候发生的事情的愤怒思绪。

"I'm falling behind... He's leaving me behind..." Small sobs began to fall on her pillow.  
"我落后了...他把我甩在后面了..." 小小的啜泣声开始落在她的枕头上。

This wasn't like her! She never cried for anyone, let alone that idiot! Pushing herself up from her bed, glaring angrily at everything around her, she made her decision.  
这不像她！她从不为任何人哭泣，更别提那个笨蛋了！她从床上坐起来，愤怒地瞪着周围的一切，做出了决定。

"I'm not losing him to anybody, especially not those two!" She stood up, her vest top and panties gently illuminated from the moonlight from her window. Creeping over to her bedroom door, she gently opened it whilst trying not to make a sound.  
"我不会让他被任何人抢走，尤其是那两个人！" 她站起身，月光从窗户洒进来，轻轻照亮了她的背心和内裤。她蹑手蹑脚地走到卧室门口，轻轻地打开门，尽量不发出声音。

The rest of the house seemed fast asleep. Which is exactly what she needed right now. She couldn't have anyone else interfering.  
屋子的其他部分似乎都已沉睡，这正是她此刻所需要的。她不能让任何人来干扰。

Luckily for her, his room was basically next door to her own.  
幸运的是，他的房间几乎就在她自己的隔壁。

Gently cracking open Shinji's bedroom door, she peeked in. He was fast asleep, one leg hanging off the side of his bed.  
轻轻推开真嗣的房门，她探头望去。他正熟睡着，一条腿悬在床沿外。

"_Thanks for leaving me some room, idiot._" She mentally cursed as she tiptoed her way to the side of his bed, and gently slid herself in.  
"谢谢你给我留了点空间，傻瓜。" 她心里暗骂着，踮着脚尖走到他的床边，轻轻地滑进他的床铺。

"You're such an idiot." She whispered, poking her crush carefully on the cheek. Wrapping her leg around one of his, she snaked her arms around him as she cuddled up to his warmth.  
"你真是个傻瓜。" 她低声说道，小心翼翼地戳了戳她暗恋对象的脸颊。她用腿缠住他的一条腿，双臂环绕着他，依偎在他的温暖中。

"You're mine, stupid Shinji. I won't let those two harlots steal you away from me." She glared at him, as though he could hear what she was saying. Instead, she found herself shocked as Shinji decided to turn around in his sleep, and face her directly. His own arms found their way around her, pulling her into a tighter cuddle then before.  
"你是我的，笨蛋真嗣。我不会让那两个狐狸精把你从我身边抢走。" 她瞪着他，仿佛他能听到她的话。然而，她惊讶地发现真嗣在睡梦中转过身来，直接面对着她。他的手臂也找到了自己的位置，将她拉得更紧，比之前更加亲密。

"H-hey, stupid Shinji! What are you doing!?"  
“嘿，笨蛋真嗣！你在干什么！？”

"Asuka..." Her whole world froze as she heard the sleepy boy mumble.  
"明日香..." 听到那睡意朦胧的男孩喃喃自语，她的整个世界仿佛凝固了。

"Are... are you awake Shinji..." The apparent answer was no, as the still sleeping Shinji proceeded to bury his head into her breasts, nuzzling happily.  
"醒...醒了吗，真嗣..." 显然答案是否定的，因为仍在熟睡中的真嗣继续将头埋进她的胸口，幸福地蹭来蹭去。

"W-wha!" Taken aback by his sudden, if unconsciously-based forwardness, she was at a loss. She, by all rights, should beat the living snot out of him for this, but...  
"什-什么！" 对于他突如其来的，尽管是无意识的行为，她感到措手不及。按理说，她应该狠狠揍他一顿，但...

If he was asleep... Then maybe it was okay. For a little while.  
如果他已经入睡...那么或许暂时无妨。就一会儿。

"A...su...ka..." The perverted idiot continued to nuzzle into her. "You smell really nice."  
"A...su...ka..." 那个变态白痴继续在她身上蹭来蹭去。"你闻起来真香。"

A faint smile crossed her face as she tightened her grip around him, giving Shinji a quick kiss on the cheek.  
她脸上掠过一丝淡淡的微笑，紧紧抱住他，迅速在真嗣的脸颊上亲了一下。

"You're welcome, Shinji. I hope you enjoy your surprise in the morning."  
"不用谢，真嗣。希望你早上会喜欢那个惊喜。"

_Another day, another chapter.  
又是一天，又是一章。_

但显然我现在在这么做，所以，希望我能保持这个势头。照这样下去，我两周就能把《天使》写完了！_

### Chapter 10: You Are Definitely (Not) Alone!  
第十章：你绝对（不）孤单！  

_What would you do if your hot childhood friend turned up in your bed wearing nothing but a vest top and panties?  
如果你的青梅竹马穿着背心和内裤突然出现在你的床上，你会怎么办？_

Shinji Ikari was a man.  
碇真嗣是个男人。

A man with morals. 一个有道德的男人。

He wasn't one of those crazy perverts who'd end up masturbating over a sleeping girl, hell no.  
他可不是那种会因为一个熟睡的女孩而自慰的变态，绝对不是。

He was a _gentleman._ 他是个绅士。

At least... That was the argument his conscious was trying to shove down his throat at seven thirty-three in the morning, after opening his eyes to literal boobs.  
至少...这是他的良心在早上七点三十三分试图塞进他喉咙的论点，当时他睁眼就看到了真实的胸部。

Forget morning wood. He was almost the victim of a morning knockout!  
别提晨勃了。他差点成了晨间击倒的受害者！

Have you ever seen those old cartoons, or even those anime that have the main protagonist, his conscious represented by an angel on one shoulder, and his desires or lust represented by a devil on the other?  
你见过那些老卡通片，或者那些动漫吗？主角的良心由一个天使代表，站在一个肩膀上，而他的欲望或欲望则由另一个肩膀上的恶魔代表。

Shinji's devil and angel side were currently in the midst of a _war._  
真嗣的恶魔与天使两面此刻正陷入一场战争。

"If she wakes up, she'll castrate us! _WITH OUR INTESTINES!"_  
“如果她醒了，她会用我们的肠子把我们阉了！”

"I'll castrate you with your damn halo, bitch boy. Look at that cleavage and tell me you don't fancy yourself indulging in some carnal desire."  
“我会用你那该死的光环把你阉了，婊子养的。看看那乳沟，告诉我你不想沉溺于肉欲之中。”

"If it was Rei, I wouldn't be here thinking up my excuses to Saint Peter!"  
"如果是丽，我就不会在这里想着怎么向圣彼得解释了！"

"Oh, so because Rei wouldn't fight back, you'd go for it!? You sick fuck, abusing defenseless girls like that."  
"哦，所以因为丽不会还手，你就敢动手了？！你这个变态，对无助的女孩做出这种事。"

"N-n-no, I didn't mean it like that!"  
"不，不，不，我不是那个意思！"

As Shinji looked between the metaphorical representations of his subconscious, he was beginning to wonder who was the real devil in their midst.  
当真嗣在象征着他潜意识的比喻之间徘徊时，他开始怀疑他们中间谁才是真正的魔鬼。

"...nnnngghh... Shinjiiii~" Asuka groaned in her sleep. "izz cooollllllld. Hug me tighter, idiooot~."  
“...嗯嗯嗯...真嗣~”明日香在睡梦中呻吟着。“好冷啊。抱紧我，笨蛋~。”

All mental fighting immediately ceased. A treaty was instantaneously signed, and the borders had been drawn on the map.  
所有的心理斗争立刻停止了。一个条约瞬间签订，地图上的边界也已划定。

Angel, Devil and Regular Shinji all shut up, nodded, and proceeded to do exactly what the redheaded demoness had ordered them to do. It may end in death and suffering, but in the end, you just can't run away from death.  
天使、恶魔和普通真嗣都闭上了嘴，点头后便按照红发女恶魔的命令行事。这可能会以死亡和痛苦告终，但最终，你无法逃避死亡。

All you can do is enjoy the chaos and carnage before the apocalypse turned the world upside down.  
你能做的只是在末日将世界颠覆之前，享受这场混乱与屠戮。

_And is was just a hug for Christ's sake!  
这只不过是一个拥抱，看在上帝的份上！_

He hadn't had many opportunities to hug her. Sure, there had been times in the past, but he never forgot her sweet scent. He would never understand how girls could still smell like flowers, even after sweating it out in midsummer Japan in a bed with a dude who just jumped off the BO train.  
他其实没多少机会拥抱她。当然，过去也有过几次，但他从未忘记她那甜美的香气。他始终无法理解，女孩们如何在仲夏日本的闷热中，与一个刚从“臭烘烘”的火车上跳下来的家伙同床共枕后，还能散发出如花朵般的芬芳。

But she just felt so soft. So warm. Her boobs felt fantastic as well, even if she was currently suffocating the poor teenage boy in an unconscious death hug into a well-endowed bosom.  
但她就是那么柔软。那么温暖。她的胸部感觉也很棒，尽管她现在正无意中用她那丰满的胸脯给这个可怜的少年一个窒息般的拥抱。

But hey, if it was his time, he at least wanted to die in the softest pillow the world had to offer.  
不过，嘿，如果这是他的末日，他至少希望自己能死在这个世界上最柔软的枕头上。

---

It was around eight twenty five in the morning.  
大约是早上八点二十五分。

Asuka was wide awake, her face redder than a traffic signal, looking down at the boy she called her childhood friend who she had apparently crushed in her sleep against her own body. Never mind she was in his bed wearing nothing but a vest hanging off one shoulder and her favorite pair of panties and-  
明日香完全清醒了，她的脸红得比交通信号灯还亮，低头看着那个她称之为青梅竹马的男孩，显然她在睡梦中紧紧地压在了自己身上。更别提她只穿着一件吊带衫，肩带滑落，以及她最喜欢的那条内裤，就躺在他的床上——

_"ohmygod WHAT WAS I THINKING!?"  
“我的天啊，我到底在想什么！？”_

This was slightly different to that one time she had tried waking him up with a kiss. At least then she had been slightly more modest, but right now, she was practically in the nude. Give or take two more moves, but she was more preoccupied with what excuse she was giving Shinji when/if he woke up.  
这次与她上次试图用亲吻唤醒他的那次略有不同。至少那时她还稍微矜持些，但现在，她几乎一丝不挂。再有两步也就差不多了，但她更在意的是，当/如果真嗣醒来时，她该找什么借口。

It seemed like a much better idea last night, when she was mad at the world and was slightly _very lustful_ for whatever reasons her pubescent hormones had decided.  
昨晚这主意似乎好得多，那时她对世界满腔怒火，又因青春期的荷尔蒙作祟而欲望难耐，至于具体原因，她自己也说不清。

Though it didn't look like he would be waking up anytime soon. Shinji was still snoozing away, a stupid grin plastered over his face as he dreamt of whatever it was teenage boys do.  
不过看起来他一时半会儿还醒不了。真嗣仍在酣睡，脸上挂着傻笑，梦里不知在做什么青春期男孩常做的事。

_"Bet it's boobs."_ Asuka mused with a grin as she poked him in the cheek.  
"肯定是胸部。" 明日香带着一丝坏笑，用手指戳了戳他的脸颊。

"Shi~nji." She whispered his name in a sing-sing voice, albeit slightly riddled with nerves.  
"真~嗣。" 她用一种轻快的语调低声呼唤他的名字，尽管略带紧张。

"Shinji~... Are you waking up~?" She continued to poke him, her heartbeat starting to pump faster. When it appeared the dreaming boy was still far away in an erotic dreamland, she went for it.  
"真嗣~... 你醒了吗~?" 她继续戳着他，心跳开始加速。当她发现梦中的男孩似乎还沉浸在某个色情的梦境中时，她决定采取行动。

Turning him on his back, Asuka found herself on top of him, her face practically glowing with all the blood being pumped to her face.  
将他翻过身来，明日香发现自己压在他身上，脸上因血液涌上而显得容光焕发。

"S-shi-nji... D-do-do-do-don't wake up prettypleaseokay." Her voice was trembling as she had the boy straddled to his own bed, her hands pushing her up from either side of his face as her orange hair fell over her shoulders and face, sparkling in the early morning sunrise.  
“真-真-真嗣...请-请-请-请不要醒来，好吗。”她的声音颤抖着，将男孩压在自己的床上，双手撑在他脸的两侧，橙色的头发垂落在肩上和脸上，在清晨的阳光下闪闪发光。

_"Please don't wake up..."_ She silently begged as she leaned in closer. She couldn't wait anymore. She gently pressed her lips to his, holding it for as long as she dared.  
“请不要醒来...”她默默祈祷着，身体更靠近了些。她再也等不及了。她轻轻地将自己的唇贴上他的，尽可能久地保持着这个吻。

It felt like forever had just passed her by in the blink of an eye. Her own eyes were closed, and her pulse had been thumping so hard she couldn't hear a thing except for the sound of her own insanity.  
仿佛一眨眼间，永恒就从她身边溜走了。她的双眼紧闭，心跳如此剧烈，以至于除了自己疯狂的心跳声，她什么也听不见。

So naturally, she didn't have a clue the bedroom door had opened behind her.  
所以自然而然，她完全没有意识到卧室的门已经在她身后打开了。

---

"This is impossible." “这不可能。”

Misato Katsuragi glared up at her ceiling. Turning on her futon, she looked at her alarm clock.  
葛城美沙斗瞪着天花板。她翻开被褥，看向闹钟。

The digital digits gleefully told her it was currently eight twenty five in the morning.  
数字显示屏欢快地告诉她，现在是早上八点二十五分。

"You'd need all seven Dragonballs and summon Shenron to make this happen." She sat up in her bed, in her usual sleeping attire of vest and panties, much like a certain someone else, and scowled at the room around her.  
“你需要集齐七颗龙珠召唤神龙才能让这发生。”她坐在床上，穿着她惯常的背心和内裤，与某人颇为相似，她皱眉环视四周。

She was awake early, on a Saturday. And not a hangover in sight.  
她在周六早早醒来，眼前没有宿醉的迹象。

_"This cannot bode well."_ She thought to herself as she stood up, stretching out the kinks in her muscles. _"This has got to be a bad omen of some kind."_  
“这可不妙。”她自言自语，站起身来，舒展着肌肉的僵硬。“这肯定是什么不祥的预兆。”

"And I'm hungry too. Maybe I can drag Shinji out of bed and make me some breakfast, if he isn't already awake." Misato giggled as she entertained the thought of waking him up as she was dressed now. It was always funny to tease the boy, and it wasn't like she basically walked around showing as much skin as possible whenever she was at home anyway.  
“而且我也饿了。也许我可以把真嗣从床上拽起来，给我做点早餐，如果他还没醒的话。”美里咯咯笑着，想象着像现在这样叫醒他的情景。捉弄那个男孩总是很有趣，而且她在家时也经常这样穿着，并不介意展示更多肌肤。

Walking out of her room, she tiptoed towards Shinji's door, an evil grin on her face.  
走出房间，她踮着脚尖朝真嗣的房门走去，脸上挂着一抹邪恶的微笑。

_"Time for your morning service Monsieur Ikari!"_ She opened the door, only to discovered she had been beaten by a certain other roommate.  
“该给你早上的服务了，一尅先生！”她推开门，却发现已经被某个室友抢先一步。

Asuka Langley Soryu was straddling her prey, her mouth melded onto his, with what looked like no apparent intention of letting go.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷正跨坐在她的猎物上，嘴巴紧贴着他的，看起来完全没有松开的打算。

By all rights, as their guardian, she should have got mad at Asuka for doing something so sneaky. But considering she was about to surprise Shinji with her own underwear show, Misato thought of an evil plan instead.  
按理说，作为他们的监护人，她应该对明日香这种鬼鬼祟祟的行为感到愤怒。但考虑到自己正打算用内衣秀给真嗣一个惊喜，美里反而心生一计。

Tiptoeing back to her own room, she opened a drawer, rummaged around and found what she had been looking for. She grinned at her treasure, and tiptoed back to Shinji's room.  
她踮着脚尖回到自己的房间，打开抽屉，翻找了一番，终于找到了她要找的东西。她对着自己的宝贝咧嘴一笑，又踮着脚回到了真嗣的房间。

As suspected, Asuka was still preoccupied. Somehow, Misato had managed to get as close as she could to the bed and leant on her knees, holding the 'treasure' in between two fingers in front of her as she prepared to give the hormonal teenagers the shock of a lifetime.  
不出所料，明日香仍沉浸在自己的世界里。美里设法尽可能靠近床边，跪在地上，用两根手指夹着那件‘宝贝’，准备给这两个青春期的少年一个终生难忘的震撼。

"I think you might have forgotten something Asuka."  
"我想你可能忘了什么，明日香。"

---

Have you ever heard that sound?  
你听过那种声音吗？

You know, the one that sounds like ringing in your ears after a bomb exploded nearby, or the occasional flash of temporary tinnitus that seems to pop into your life every now and again?  
就是那种，像炸弹在附近爆炸后耳朵里的嗡鸣声，或是偶尔闪现的暂时性耳鸣，似乎时不时就会闯入你的生活？

That was all Asuka could currently hear as she opened her shellshocked eyes, mouth still glued to Shinji's as she turned her face ever so slightly to see the 'adult' of the house, grinning like a madwomen, holding what looked very much like a condom package in between them.  
那是明日香目前唯一能听到的声音，当她睁开惊魂未定的眼睛时，她的嘴仍然紧贴着真嗣的嘴，她微微转过头去，看到家里的'大人'，像疯女人一样咧嘴笑着，手里拿着一个看起来很像避孕套包装的东西。

"Whilst I don't exactly condone this kind of behavior, if you're going to do it secretly, at least be prepared for any unexpected consequences."  
“虽然我并不完全赞同这种行为，但如果你们要偷偷摸摸地做，至少要做好应对意外后果的准备。”

---

"I SAID I WAS SORRY ASUKA, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM ME!?"  
“我说了对不起，明日香，你还想从我这里得到什么！？”

All Asuka could do was scream in retaliation to Misato's question as the apartment was once again turned into a warzone.  
面对美里的问题，明日香只能尖叫以对，公寓再次变成了战场。

Due to some technical issues, Misato's administrator bracelet had been taken in for maintenance. So the purple-haired teacher was currently cowering in fear behind Mana and Rei as Asuka proceeded to firebomb everything in sight.  
由于一些技术问题，美里的管理员手环被送去维修了。因此，这位紫发教师此刻正躲在真奈和绫波身后，害怕得瑟瑟发抖，而明日香则开始对眼前的一切进行狂轰滥炸。

"Really Sensei. Waving a condom in front of her face probably wasn't the best idea in the circumstances." Mana chuckled as she raised her shields to the maximum, deflecting a fireball into Shinji's wardrobe, setting all of Shinji's clothes on fire.  
“真的，老师。在这种情形下，拿着避孕套在她面前晃悠恐怕不是个好主意。”真奈笑着说，同时将护盾开到最大，将一颗火球弹向真嗣的衣柜，点燃了他所有的衣服。

"What I really want to know is why Soryu was in Shinji's room to begin with. I'll be sure to interrogate her once she has calmed down." Rei said nonchalantly as her shields were also raised, defending the stricken Misato as she watched her apartment burn in fire and fury.  
“我真正想知道的是，为什么索留最初会在真嗣的房间里。等她冷静下来，我一定会审问她。”绫波淡然地说道，同时她的防御也已展开，保护着受伤的美里，她眼睁睁地看着自己的公寓在火与怒中燃烧。

Both Mana and Rei had come running out of their rooms when they heard Misato's cry for help as the whole apartment had shook. It was as though an earthquake had targeted just their floor as the walls blew dust throughout the damaged structure.  
玛娜和绫波听到美里的呼救声后，都从各自的房间冲了出来，整个公寓都在震动。仿佛地震只瞄准了她们这一层，墙壁上的灰尘随着受损结构的爆裂四处飞扬。

Because it was deemed an emergency, they had not had a chance to change, and Shinji had woken up to what could only be described as the war of the panties. Mana and Rei didn't even have the luxury of shirts. But at least Mana had a bra on...  
由于被认定为紧急情况，她们没有机会换衣服，真嗣醒来时看到的只能形容为内裤大战。玛娜和绫波甚至连衬衫都没穿。但至少玛娜还戴着胸罩……

Sitting on the remains of his bed, a deadpan expression on his face, Shinji firmly decided he was going to buy a lock for his door. And he was definitely having fish today, if not for every meal he'd have for the rest of his life.  
坐在床的残骸上，脸上毫无表情，真嗣坚定地决定要给自己的房门买把锁。而且他今天一定要吃鱼，如果不是每顿饭都吃鱼的话，那他这辈子剩下的日子都要吃鱼了。

### Chapter 11: Return To The Origin  
第十一章：回归本源  

Shinji Ikari woke up with a start. Thankfully, his room was empty for once, his recently repaired bedroom dimly lit in the rising sun's lazy light. Pulling on his usual attire, he noticed a strange feeling. He knew what it was, but he couldn't quite put it into words.  
碇真嗣猛地醒来。幸运的是，他的房间这次空无一人，最近修好的卧室在初升太阳的慵懒光线中昏暗地照亮着。他穿上平时的衣服，注意到一种奇怪的感觉。他知道那是什么，但无法用言语表达。

Opening the door of his bedroom, he was beginning to confirm his earlier emotions. The house was eerily quiet. Misato, Rei, Mana... and Asuka. Nobody was home.  
打开卧室的门，他开始确认之前的情绪。房子异常安静。美里、绫波、玛娜……还有明日香。家里一个人也没有。

No. It was even quieter than that. Misato's tiny little apartment looked as though nobody had lived in it for years. Braving himself, Shinji walked around all the bedrooms in the apartment, knowing full well that if the girls were hiding in some corner, at least one of them would punch him into next Tuesday.  
不，这里比那还要安静。美里的小小公寓看起来仿佛多年无人居住。深吸一口气，真嗣在公寓的各个卧室间徘徊，他心里清楚，如果女孩们藏在某个角落，至少会有一个会把他揍到下周二。

But he found nothing. 但他什么也没找到。

Misato's room was bare. No furnishings or furniture. It was as though nobody had lived there at all. He found a similar story going into Asuka's room. Not a soul had ever touched foot in that room, he was sure of it. Rei and Mana's rooms didn't even exist, which confused him even more. It had been necessary to use the power of their bracelets to make a sort of makeshift renovation for the girls to move in.  
美里的房间空空如也，没有任何家具。仿佛从未有人居住过。他走进明日香的房间，情况如出一辙。他确信，从未有人踏足过那个房间。丽和玛娜的房间甚至不存在，这让他更加困惑。为了女孩们能搬进来，他们不得不借助手环的力量进行了一次临时的改造。

But where their bedroom doors should have been was the unmistakable sight of the apartment's bland colored walls. No door. No handle. No Rei. No Mana.  
但本应是卧室门的地方，却是公寓那单调色彩墙壁的清晰景象。没有门。没有把手。没有丽。没有真奈。

Panic was beginning to take hold. He didn't have a clue what was going on. Where was everybody?  
恐慌开始占据心头。他完全不知道发生了什么。大家都在哪儿？

Running to the apartment door, he swiped his keycard. The door's automatic systems were offline. Grabbing the manual release, Shinji shifted the surprisingly heavy door open and took a look outside.  
他跑到公寓门前，刷了下钥匙卡。门的自动系统已离线。抓住手动释放装置，真嗣用力推开了异常沉重的门，向外望去。

...Or what was left of it.  
...或是它残存的部分。

A destroyed world greeted his view. A blood-red sky illuminated destroyed apartment buildings and collapsed skyscrapers over what should have been the view of Tokyo-3. Looking around the building he was currently in, he was genuinely surprised Misato's apartment block was still standing. Everything bar their apartment was in total ruins. Girders were pointing out of huge holes in the structure, as though a huge bullet or something similar had torn chunks out of the architecture. But the most disturbing thing was easily the huge, alien looking hand that was resting on a good portion of the building. That entire side of the building the giant, severed limb was resting on was caked in what looked like a ton of _blood_.  
一个毁灭的世界映入他的眼帘。血红色的天空照亮了被摧毁的公寓楼和倒塌的摩天大楼，本应是东京-3 的景象。环顾四周，他所在的建筑，他真的惊讶于美里小姐的公寓楼居然还屹立不倒。除了他们的公寓，其他一切都是废墟。巨大的钢筋从建筑结构上的大洞中伸出，仿佛是被巨大的子弹或其他类似的东西撕裂了建筑。但最令人不安的，无疑是那只巨大的、看起来像外星生物的手，它正压在建筑的大部分上。那只巨型断肢所压的那一侧建筑，覆盖着看起来像是一大滩血的东西。

But what scared him more than anything else, was that he vaguely recognized that hand from somewhere.  
但比任何事情都更让他害怕的，是他隐约觉得那只手在某个地方见过。

His whole body shaking, he picked his way closer to the hand, across the external balcony of their apartment building. Dodging countless holes and debris was difficult, but he made it to the other side, trying his hardest not to breathe in the smell of death and rot the blue and slightly black, robotic looking hand was giving off. Leaning over the edge of the balcony, he peered over to see if the hand was connected to anything.  
他全身颤抖着，小心翼翼地穿过公寓楼的外阳台，向那只手靠近。避开无数的洞口和碎片十分艰难，但他还是设法到达了另一边，竭尽全力不去吸入那只蓝色略带黑色、机器人般的手所散发出的死亡与腐烂的气味。他俯身探出阳台边缘，试图查看那只手是否连接着什么。

And saw Mana's Evangelion Unit 00, albeit it being easily taller than the apartment building, and looking as though _something had been eating it_.  
然后他看到了真嗣的零号机，尽管它比公寓楼还要高得多，看起来像是被什么东西啃食过一样。

"_W-what the hell is going on?_" Shinji whispered, horrified by the titanic, robotic corpse in front of him. "_What... why... Why is an Evangelion... here!?_"  
“这...这到底是怎么回事？”真嗣低声惊呼，眼前巨大的机器人尸体让他感到恐惧。“为什么...为什么零号机会在这里！？”

After somehow making his way out of the building, he slowly walked over to the head of the downed beast. Or what was left of it at least. Half of what he could assume was a skull was protruding from the giant robots helmet. It apparently used to have a single, cyclopedic eye too, though god only knew where that had gone, leaving a black, gaping abyss in its place.  
经过一番周折，他终于走出了那栋建筑，缓缓地走向那倒地巨兽的头部。或者说，至少是它残存的部分。他猜测那应该是半个头骨，从巨型机器人的头盔中突出来。它原本似乎还有一只巨大的、百科全书般的眼睛，但天知道那只眼睛去了哪里，只留下一个漆黑、空洞的深渊。

Some distance away, Shinji noticed something else. A long, somewhat thin, cylindrical tube was lying on the ground, easily enough to fit a human inside, if not a few. Some sort of hatch was open on the tube. A terrifying sense of dread raced through him, as his feet slowly dragged his way towards the tube. He was more scared than he had ever been in his life. Partly due to the fact that he felt an incredible amount of familiarity when he saw the strange object.  
在稍远的地方，真嗣注意到了别的东西。一根细长的圆柱形管子躺在地上，足够容纳一个人，甚至几个人。管子上有一个舱门是打开的。一股强烈的恐惧感袭来，他的脚步不由自主地拖着他向那根管子走去。他从未如此害怕过。部分原因是当他看到这个奇怪的物体时，感到一种难以置信的熟悉感。

Like he had seen it before somewhere.  
仿佛他曾在某个地方见过它。

But even though his memories from eight years ago were kind of fuzzy, he could clearly remember Mana hadn't shown him anything else with her toy Evangelions. He certainly didn't remember a tube-like object from back then. So why did he feel he knew what it was?  
但尽管八年前他的记忆有些模糊，他仍能清楚地记得 Mana 没有用她的玩具福音战士给他展示过其他东西。他当然不记得当时有这样一个管状物体。那么，为什么他觉得自己知道它是什么？

The hatch had opened facing the sky. After some difficulty, Shinji managed to pile some debris together, enough to help him make a stand to clamber on top of the metallic tube. Even touching it as he clambered on top left him with that same horrifying sense of familiarity. How on earth did he... recognize this thing!?  
舱门是朝天空开的。经过一番努力，真嗣设法堆起了一些碎片，足够让他站稳脚跟，爬上金属管的顶部。即使在他爬上去时触摸到它，也让他感到那种可怕的熟悉感。他到底是怎么......认出这东西的！？

Standing on top it the metal hunk, keenly aware that he felt like a tightrope walker taking tentative steps towards his own doom, Shinji slowly made his way forward, aware that a strong gust of wind was threatening to blow him off lest he make any kind of haste. He eventually made it to the opened hatch, and took a very long time convincing himself to look inside.  
站在那块金属上，真嗣敏锐地意识到自己就像一个走钢丝的人，小心翼翼地走向自己的厄运，他慢慢地向前移动，意识到一阵强风随时可能将他吹落，除非他加快速度。最终，他到达了打开的舱门，花了很长时间才说服自己往里面看。

It was dark, and he noticed a strange liquid pooled at the bottom of the container. Intricately designed machinery was inside, but it was still a little too dark for him to see anything clearly. Taking a deep breath, Shinji climbed into the hatch and let himself down, an audible splash echoing as he landed in whatever the strange liquid was under his feet. His breath was ragged, and he was only faintly aware his pulse was hammering through his chest. He looked up and his breath suddenly got caught in his throat.  
四周一片漆黑，他注意到容器底部积聚着一种奇怪的液体。内部是精巧设计的机械装置，但光线实在太暗，他看不清任何东西。深吸一口气，真嗣爬进舱口，让自己滑下去，随着一声响亮的溅水声，他落入了脚下那不知名的液体中。他的呼吸急促，只能隐约感觉到心跳如鼓点般在胸腔中回响。他抬头望去，呼吸突然一窒。

Lying in a chair, curled into a fetal position, was another corpse, although it was easy to see that this person had once been human. A skeleton, wrapped in a strange, yet-once-again somewhat familiar suit of white that clung to the body tightly, highlighted with black in certain areas. And from what little he could see of the torso from where he stood, he could easily see the numbers '00' embellished just under the collar.  
椅子上躺着一具蜷缩成胎儿姿势的尸体，尽管不难看出这个人曾经是人类。一具骷髅，包裹在一件奇怪却又有些熟悉的白色紧身衣中，某些部位用黑色点缀。从他所站的位置看去，他可以清楚地看到胸口下方绣着数字“00”。

He should have been running. Run somewhere far, far away. But his whole body was frozen, his eyes unmoving from the corpse, the corpse of someone he was sure he knew.  
他本该逃跑的。逃到很远很远的地方去。但他的整个身体僵住了，目光一动不动地盯着那具尸体，那具他确信自己认识的尸体。

"W-who are you..." His trembling voice echoed around the inside of the metallic walls.  
"你、你是谁..." 他颤抖的声音在金属墙内回荡。

_"She was somebody I failed."  
"她是我未能保护的人。"_

Whirling around, Shinji looked at where the strange, disembodied voice had come from, his pulse skyrocketing as he searched for whoever had just talked behind him.  
转身望去，真嗣寻找着那奇怪的、无实体声音的来源，心跳加速，试图找出刚刚在他背后说话的人。

"WHO ARE YOU!? W-WHERE ARE YOU!?"  
"你是谁！？你在哪儿！？"

_"I am you. And I am right beside you."  
"我就是你。我就在你身边。"_

"DON'T BULLSHIT WITH ME. I CAN'T SEE YOU." Shinji looked around him in a panic. He couldn't see anything. What the hell was going on? And that voice... sounded just like...  
"别跟我胡扯。我看不见你。" 真嗣惊慌地环顾四周。他什么也看不见。这到底是怎么回事？还有那个声音...听起来就像...

Standing on top of the hatch above him, he finally noticed the ghostly-looking boy looking down at him. A boy he instantly recognized, but could barely recognize at all.  
站在他头顶的舱口上，他终于注意到了那个幽灵般的男孩正俯视着他。一个他立刻认出，却又几乎无法辨认的男孩。

The ghost of Shinji Ikari was talking to the living, breathing Shinji Ikari. The ghost was wearing a suit similar to the skeleton was, except it had a purple color scheme, with highlights of green and red.  
碇真嗣的幽灵正在与活着的、呼吸着的碇真嗣交谈。幽灵穿着一套与骷髅相似的西装，只是颜色方案是紫色的，点缀着绿色和红色的高光。

"W-who... are you?" “你...你是谁？”

_"Come with me, and I'll show you."  
"跟我来，我会展示给你看。"_

Clambering out of the hatch, living Shinji once again found himself in the bask of the blood-red sky looming over what was left of Tokyo-3. Ghost Shinji was standing next to him, a tired expression worn over a stretched face. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his suit was torn in several places. What on earth happened?  
从舱口爬出，活着的碇真嗣再次发现自己置身于笼罩着残破的第三新东京市的血红色天空之下。幽灵真嗣站在他旁边，脸上带着疲惫的表情，面容显得有些憔悴。他的眼圈下有黑眼圈，西装也在多处破损。到底发生了什么？

_"I am you. Although it would be a lie to say I am the same you."  
"我就是你。虽然说我就是你，这话并不完全准确。"_

"That doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense."  
"那根本说不通。"

The ghost gave a weak chuckle. It was a depressing sort of noise, full of mirth and depression. It was like looking into a shattered mirror. Warped, and nothing like what Shinji could even imagine. He was looking at a broken version of himself.  
幽灵发出了一声微弱的轻笑。这是一种令人沮丧的声音，充满了欢乐与忧郁。就像凝视着一面破碎的镜子，扭曲变形，与真嗣所能想象的完全不同。他正看着一个支离破碎的自己。

_"I'm not going to lie, it gets a fair bit weirder from here on out."_ _Broken_ Shinji still seemed to have a sense of humor, although it was still riddled with a lack of sanity and warmth.  
"我不打算撒谎，从这里开始会变得更加奇怪。""破碎的真嗣似乎仍保有一丝幽默感，尽管其中依然充斥着疯狂与冷漠。

The ghost and Shinji left the metallic tube and starting walking into the ruins of the city. Not a soul was to be found, save for the schoolboy and the literal soul pacing around.  
幽灵和真嗣离开了那个金属管，开始走向城市的废墟。除了四处徘徊的校园男孩和那个字面意义上的灵魂，再无一人踪影。

"You still haven't really answered my question."  
“你还是没有真正回答我的问题。”

_"Before I answer that, there is something I need to show you. But before I do that, I need to ask you a very important question."_ The ghost stopped in the middle of a downtown high street, riddled with craters and destroyed buildings. Turning to face the living, the ghost looked grim.  
“在我回答之前，有些东西我需要给你看。但在那之前，我需要问你一个非常重要的问题。”幽灵停在了市中心一条满是弹坑和毁坏建筑的大街上，转身面对着活人，神情严峻。

_"Do you believe in God?"  
"你相信上帝吗？"_

---

They continued to walk. Shinji was beginning to recognize parts of the city, at least from what was left of it. But there were some parts he didn't. Putting aside the destroyed remnants of huge artillery guns stationed at various parts of the city, and what looked like destroyed military tanks and VTOLs littering the streets, there were also signs pointing to evacuation shelters. Looking around him answered quite plainly that at some point they had been necessary, but in his Tokyo-3, he'd never seen any of those signs. Aside from earthquake-related shelters, but they didn't look anywhere near as hi-tech as some of the destroyed shelters they'd walked past. It was as though they were built to repel nuclear blasts, or some other weapon of mass destruction. And had failed.  
他们继续前行。真嗣开始辨认出城市的某些部分，至少是从残留的部分来看。但有些地方他并不熟悉。撇开散布在城市各处被毁坏的重型火炮残骸，以及街道上看似被摧毁的军用坦克和垂直起降飞机不谈，还有指向疏散避难所的标志。环顾四周，很明显这些避难所在某个时刻曾是必要的，但在他的第三新东京市，他从没见过这些标志。除了与地震相关的避难所外，但它们看起来远没有他们经过的一些被毁避难所那么高科技。仿佛它们是为了抵御核爆炸或其他大规模杀伤性武器而建，却失败了。

"This is seriously messed up... What the hell happened..." Shinji murmured as they picked their way through the destroyed city.  
"这真是乱套了...到底发生了什么..." 真嗣喃喃自语，他们小心翼翼地穿过这座被毁的城市。

The ghost was silent, walking towards whatever unknown destination he had in mind. It was frightening, but Shinji had no other choice but to follow his ethereal doppelgänger to wherever this madness ended.  
幽灵沉默着，朝他心中未知的终点走去。这情景令人恐惧，但真嗣别无选择，只能跟随这位飘渺的分身，直到这场疯狂终结。

Eventually, they reached what looked like a station. A station leading underground. Written in big letters above the entrance was the words 'GEOFRONT ENTRANCE B-2'. There was also a smaller notice underneath.  
最终，他们到达了一个看似车站的地方。一个通往地下的车站。入口上方用大字写着‘GEOFRONT 入口 B-2’。下方还有一则较小的告示。

_Entrance strictly prohibited to NERV personnel only. Unauthorized access will lead to prosecution.  
仅限 NERV 人员进入。未经授权的访问将导致起诉。_

NERV.

"NERV." Shinji whispered. He was sure he had never said the name in his life, but the word fell off his tongue effortlessly. Like it was used to it.  
"NERV。" 真嗣低声说道。他确信自己一生中从未提及过这个名字，但这个词却毫不费力地从他舌尖滑落。仿佛早已习惯。

_"Let us go."_ _Ghost_ Shinji said somberly as he walked into the station.  
"我们走吧。" 幽灵真嗣肃穆地说着，走进了车站。

"B-but the sign...!" "但指示牌...！"

_"It's alright. There is nobody there now."  
“没事的，现在那里没人。”_

Shinji didn't know whether he should feel relieved or even more scared by that. Where was everybody?  
真嗣不知道自己是该感到松一口气，还是更加害怕。大家都去哪儿了？

The inside felt like some sort of crazy military base. Metallic walls, riddled with what looked like gunshots and bloodstains continued down towards a broken sliding door, embellished with what looked like a logo of some kind. It was hard to make out from all the beating the door had taken, but he could clearly make out 'NERV' in red, along with something like a slogan circled around it.  
内部看起来像是个疯狂的军事基地。金属墙壁上布满了像是枪击和血迹的痕迹，一直延伸到一扇破损的滑动门，门上装饰着某种标志。虽然门遭受了重创，难以辨认，但他清楚地看到了红色的“NERV”字样，周围似乎还有一圈标语。

"Gods in his heaven..." Shinji voiced with trembling nerves.  
"神在他的天堂..." 真嗣颤抖着声音说道。

_"...All's right with the world. Ha."_ The ghost finished with a bitter laugh. _"Nothing's right with the world. Nothing..."_  
"...世界一切安好。哈。" 幽灵以苦笑结束。"世界没有一处是好的。没有..."

They walked a little further in, and came across what looked like a tram, with it's tracks leading deeper into the underground. It was surprisingly a lot less damaged than the rest of what Shinji had seen so far. Entering into the train, Shinji followed his ghost, looking apprehensively at the vehicle around him.  
他们又往里走了一段，遇到了一辆看起来像是有轨电车的东西，轨道延伸至更深的地下。这比真嗣迄今所见的大部分地方都要完好得多。进入列车后，真嗣紧随幽灵，不安地环顾四周的车辆。

_"I bet there's no power left, but maybe we'll be lucky. Grab that lever for me."  
"我敢打赌电力已经耗尽了，但或许我们能走运。帮我拉一下那个操纵杆。"_

"What? Why me?" "什么？为什么是我？"

_"It'll be kind of hard to make this thing move when I can no longer touch anything."_ The ghost demonstrated his point by trying to grab the lever, and his hand simply passing through it. With his point taken, Shinji grimaced and pulled the lever. After a moment's uncertainty, there was a jolt as the train's deep slumber was interrupted, it's internals groaning in protest as the train began a slow descent into the darkness.  
"当我连碰都碰不到任何东西的时候，要移动这玩意儿可有点困难。" 幽灵用行动证明了他的观点，试图抓住操纵杆，但手直接穿了过去。意识到这一点后，真嗣皱了皱眉，拉下了操纵杆。片刻的不确定后，列车猛地一震，仿佛从沉睡中被唤醒，内部发出抗议般的呻吟，缓缓驶入黑暗之中。

_"What do you know, apparently there is some power left. I hope there's enough for a return trip."_ The ghost laughed mirthlessly, giving Shinji another reason to panic.  
"你知道吗，显然还有一些能量剩下。希望足够我们返程。" 幽灵冷笑一声，这让真嗣又多了一个恐慌的理由。

"Don't joke about that! Where are we going anyway!?" The laugh left the ghosts face quickly, and something like anger flashed over his face.  
"别开这种玩笑！我们到底要去哪儿！？" 笑声很快从幽灵的脸上消失，取而代之的是一种类似愤怒的表情。

_"Into the heart of everything. Where everything began, and everything ended."  
"进入一切的核心。一切开始的地方，也是一切结束的地方。"_

Light flashed past the windows as the view suddenly expanded from jet-black. Shinji gasped in terror at what should have been a beautiful sight, but was now a wasteland. Greenland was now dyed red from huge amounts of blood, there was destruction and debris everywhere, and Shinji saw the remnants of what looked like a pyramid erected in the center.  
光线掠过车窗，视野突然从漆黑一片中展开。本应是美景的景象，如今却成了一片荒芜，让真嗣惊恐万分。格陵兰岛被大量鲜血染成了红色，到处是破坏和残骸，真嗣看到中央似乎矗立着一座金字塔的遗迹。

But what caught his attention was the sight of another gigantic Evangelion. It was bright red, and had an embellished number of 02. Half of it's head was missing, several of it's remaining eyes had been gouged out, leaving only a single green eye remaining. It's arms and legs had been severed and even from the considerable distance they were, Shinji could still make out a meaty cross-section from the severed limbs. The quick glance he had seen suddenly made his stomach lurch, and he was almost thankful the destroyed scenery had been blotted out as the train made its way through another tunnel.  
但吸引他注意的是另一台巨大的 EVA。它鲜红夺目，编号 02 装饰华丽。它的头部缺失了一半，剩下的几只眼睛被挖出，仅剩一只绿色的眼睛。它的四肢被切断，即使相隔甚远，真嗣仍能清晰地看到断肢处的血肉横截面。那一瞥让他胃里一阵翻腾，他几乎庆幸列车驶入另一个隧道，破坏的景象被暂时遮蔽。

_"Heh. I don't think you'll be holding on to your lunch anyway, we'll need to go see Unit 02 up close."  
“呵，我看你午餐是保不住了，我们得去近距离看看 02 号机。”_

"Are you joking!? Why?!" "你在开玩笑吧！？为什么！"

_"We need to go visit the grave of another I failed."  
"我们得去拜访另一个我未能救赎的墓地。"_

_"Aren't you a ball of sunshine."_ Shinji thought grimly as the train pulled into a stop. After a considerably long walk across the destroyed ruins outside, Shinji looked up to realize he could see the sky, even though they had travelled what felt like miles underground.  
"你真是个阳光灿烂的家伙。" 真嗣阴郁地想着，火车缓缓停下。经过一段相当长的步行穿越外面的废墟后，真嗣抬头发现他竟然能看到天空，尽管他们似乎已经在地下行进了数英里。

_"You never used to be able to see the sky. But after the Geofront was destroyed, well..."_ Ghost Shinji didn't have to explain. The blood-red sky peering at them from their giant hideaway hole was answer enough.  
"你以前从未能看见天空。但在地底都市被摧毁后，嗯..." 幽灵真嗣无需多言。从他们巨大的藏身洞穴中窥视着他们的血红色天空，已经足够说明一切。

After a short while, they made it to the corpse of the red giant. _Corpse_ felt like fitting word for a robot that apparently had blood, muscles and bones, like the ones Shinji could visibly see sticking out from the red Unit 02. He looked at his own terrified reflection from the single, lifeless eye left on the towering robot.  
不久后，他们来到了红色巨人的残骸前。对于一具显然拥有血液、肌肉和骨骼的机器人来说，"残骸"这个词再合适不过了，真嗣可以清楚地看到红色二号机上突出的这些东西。他从那只仅存的、无生命的巨大眼睛中看到了自己惊恐的倒影。

_"What happened to you..."_ Shinji's mind echoed the question, along with the million other questions he needed answering about the state of the world he was in. The only one who could answer his questions had walked away, towards another tube-like object that he had found earlier. This time the hatch was open on it's side, allowing the ghost Shinji to simply walk inside.  
"你发生了什么..." 真嗣的脑海中回荡着这个问题，以及他需要解答的关于这个世界的无数其他问题。唯一能回答他问题的人已经走开，朝他之前发现的另一个管状物体走去。这次舱门是侧开的，幽灵真嗣可以直接走进去。

Not looking forward to it, living Shinji followed him in.  
不情愿地，活生生的真嗣跟着他进去了。

And found another corpse. This time not in the fetal position, but lying back on the chair, it's hands still grabbing the two joysticks, the skull's morbid smile grinning at the terrified boy. Shinji spotted the same '02' markings as was on the Evangelion's body outside. But the number was quickly forgotten as he paid more attention to the skeleton's face, and noticed a pair of crimson head accessories where the hair should have been. Head accessories that looked an awful lot like the ones...  
又发现了一具尸体。这次不是蜷缩的胎儿姿势，而是仰靠在椅子上，双手仍然紧握着两个操纵杆，骷髅那病态的笑容对着惊恐的男孩咧开。真嗣注意到了与外面 Eva 机体上相同的'02'标记。但这个数字很快就被他遗忘，因为他更关注骷髅的面孔，并注意到本该是头发的地方有一对鲜红的头饰。这些头饰看起来非常像……

_"A-Asu...ka...?!"_ A scared whimper escaped from him as Shinji took a step backwards, the liquid on the floor splashing loudly.  
“绫……绫波……？！”一声恐惧的呜咽从他口中逃出，真嗣后退一步，地板上的液体溅起响亮的声音。

_"That is correct. The second girl I failed."_ His ghost was looking at the corpse, an unreadable expression on his face.  
“那是正确的。第二个女孩，我失败了。”他的幽灵凝视着尸体，脸上表情难以捉摸。

_"Asuka Langley Soryu. The Pilot of Evangelion Unit 02."  
“惣流·明日香·兰格雷。EVA 二号机的驾驶员。”_

Shinji was beyond shocked. His mind was getting closer and closer to a nervous breakdown, but he still had one, excruciatingly painful question to ask.  
真嗣震惊至极。他的精神越来越接近崩溃边缘，但还有一个痛苦至极的问题要问。

"W-was that other... c-c-_corpse_ we saw e-earlier...?"  
"那-那是我们之前看到的另...另...另一具尸体吗...？"

_"Rei Ayanami. The Pilot of Evangelion Unit 00."  
"绫波零。EVA 初号机的驾驶员。"_

_"N-no... Asuka... Rei... NO!"_ Shinji wanted to scream, he wanted to throw up, he wanted to curl up in a ball, or run away or anything to stop this nightmare unravelling around him.  
"不...明日香...绫波...不！" 真嗣想要尖叫，想要呕吐，想要蜷缩成一团，或是逃跑，或是做任何事情来阻止这场噩梦在他周围展开。

"A-and Misato?! Mana Kirishima?! My parents?!" Shinji could barely whisper. He didn't want to hear, but he needed to know.  
“美里小姐？！雾岛真名？！我的父母？！” 真嗣几乎无法出声。他不想听，但又必须知道。

_"Misato is dead. My mother died when I was four years old, in what was known as a 'Contact Experiment'. My father..."_ The ghost looked ready to murder at the mention of their shared father.  
“美里已经去世了。我母亲在我四岁时就死了，那次被称为‘接触实验’的事故中。我父亲……” 提到他们共同的父亲时，幽灵看起来像是要杀人一样。

_"My father. Gendo Ikari."_ The ghost looked horrifyingly angry. Shinji backed away slowly, eyes wide, shivering in raw fear.  
“我的父亲。碇源堂。” 幽灵看起来愤怒得可怕。真嗣慢慢后退，眼睛睁得大大的，浑身因纯粹的恐惧而颤抖。

_"Gendo Ikari is the man who helped me destroy the world."  
"碇源堂是那个帮助我毁灭世界的人。"_

His fear had become numb. The shock of those words turned off everything in his brain except the echo of his ghost's last words reverberating around his mind. His father, had helped me, destroy... the world?  
他的恐惧已变得麻木。那些话语带来的震惊关闭了他大脑中的一切，除了他幽灵最后的话语在他脑海中回荡。他的父亲，帮助我，毁灭...世界？

_"But I'm curious. You mentioned another..."_ The ghost turned around to face him, his anger replaced by curiosity.  
"但我很好奇。你提到了另一个..." 幽灵转过身来面对他，愤怒被好奇所取代。

_"Who is Mana Kirishima?" "谁是御槍マナ？"_

Shinji's mental collapse was temporarily halted by the next revelation thrown at him from his crazy ghost. _What do you mean, who was Mana Kirishima?_  
真嗣的精神崩溃暂时被这个疯狂幽灵抛出的下一个真相所打断。你什么意思，谁是御槍マナ？

"We... wait, what? You don't know Mana?" The ghost shook his head, cocking his head to one side, as though he'd forgotten something and was trying to remember.  
"我们...等等，什么？你不认识マナ？" 幽灵摇了摇头，歪着头，仿佛忘记了什么，正在努力回忆。

"She's about yay-tall, deep red hair, cerulean eyes?"  
"她大概这么高，深红色头发，天蓝色眼睛？"

_"Are you sure that isn't Asuka?"  
"你确定那不是明日香？"_

"No! Mana had short hair, was a much deeper shade of red than Asuka, not orange."  
"不是！真奈的头发短，颜色比明日香深得多，不是橙红色。"

_"Hmmm..."_ The ghost looked thoughtful. _"I've never known someone like that. Not in this world."_  
"嗯……" 幽灵若有所思地看着。"我从没在这个世界上遇到过这样的人。"

"In... this world?" "在这个……世界上？"

_Ghost_ Shinji clambered out of the tube's hatch, after taking one last look at Asuka's corpse, nodding with what looked like a silent promise.  
幽灵真嗣从管道的舱口爬了出来，最后看了一眼明日香的尸体，点了点头，仿佛在无声地许下承诺。

_"It's time I told you the reason you were brought here. There isn't much time, and as you can see, this world ran out of time. Way before it's time."  
"是时候告诉你带你来这里的原因了。时间不多了，而且如你所见，这个世界早已耗尽了时间。远在它该结束之前。"_

Shinji clambered out of the tube, himself taking one last terrified look at the grinning remains of what was a girl he cared about in his own world. Standing on the Geofront's blood-red burnt wasteland, he felt a strange wind blow through the place as he faced his ghost.  
真嗣从管子里爬了出来，最后一次惊恐地看了一眼那个在他原本世界里他所关心的女孩的狞笑遗骸。站在第三新东京市血红色的焦土上，他感到一阵怪风穿过这个地方，面对着自己的幽灵。

_"Let me tell you the tale of the boy who became God, and the man who destroyed the world."  
"让我告诉你那个成为神的男孩和那个毁灭世界的男人的故事。"_

---

A long time had passed. _Ghost_ Shinji explained his life from the very beginning. And from the sounds of things, had experienced a very different life to the one the living Shinji Ikari had experienced.  
时光荏苒。幽灵真嗣从最初开始讲述他的生活。从他的描述来看，他所经历的人生与活着的碇真嗣截然不同。

The Evangelions, who in his world were only the figment of a hyperactive six-year-old's imagination, were titanic weapons used to defend the world from alien '_Angels_', intent on wiping out all life on the planet in this one.  
在他的世界里，那些被一个过度活跃的六岁孩子想象出来的‘福音战士’，实际上是用来抵御外星‘使徒’的巨型武器，这些使徒意图消灭地球上所有的生命。

His father had apparently been a basket case, using the pretense of fighting these '_Angels_' as an excuse to use the potential awakening and deification of an Evangelion to wish his dead wife, and Shinji's mother, back to life. His mother, who was also trapped inside the core of Evangelion Unit-01, and powering it with her own soul.  
他的父亲显然是个疯子，以对抗这些‘使徒’为借口，利用福音战士的觉醒和神化潜力，试图将他死去的妻子，也是真嗣的母亲，复活。而他的母亲，也被困在福音战士初号机的核心中，用自己的灵魂为其提供能量。

Then it appeared Rei Ayanami was some sort of hybrid between an Angel herself, and a clone of his dead mother, to which countless 'replacements' had existed. She was to be used in something called the '_Human Instrumentality Project_', relating to the existence of a dark organization called '_Seele_', intending to turn all of humanity into a mass, conglomerated soul, in an effort to preserve humanity, for everyone to become one with each other, and to force humanity to evolve past it's apparent boundaries.  
随后，碇唯似乎是某种介于使徒自身与她已故母亲克隆体之间的混合体，存在着无数的‘替代品’。她将被用于一个名为‘人类补完计划’的项目中，与一个名为‘Seele’的黑暗组织有关，该组织意图将全人类转化为一个庞大的、聚合的灵魂，以此来保存人类，让每个人相互融合，并迫使人类超越其明显的界限。

Not to mention that _this_ world's Shinji Ikari had apparently been abandoned by his father not long after his mother died at some nameless train station, raised by a teacher, and was practically alone for the majority of his life.  
更不用说，这个世界中的碇真嗣在母亲死于某个无名车站后不久，似乎就被父亲抛弃了，由一位老师抚养长大，并在他生命的大部分时间里几乎都是独自一人。

And in the end, the dark plans that would destroy the world had succeeded. But in a very different way to how Gendo Ikari and Seele had imagined.  
最终，那些将毁灭世界的黑暗计划成功了。但与碇源堂和 Seele 所设想的方式截然不同。

It appeared that in this fight, the Angels had won. Terminal Dogma, the lowest level of what had been NERV headquarters had been breached. Housing a captured Angel known as Lilith, it had been the purpose of the '_Children_' to defend her, not knowing their true purpose for fighting.  
在这场战斗中，天使们似乎取得了胜利。曾是 NERV 总部最底层的地方——终端教条区已被攻破。这里关押着被称为莉莉丝的天使，而‘孩子们’的任务是保护她，却不知自己战斗的真正目的。

But the mission had failed. As per orders of Misato Katsuragi, the Operational Director of NERV, ranking under his father, the central complex had been set to self-destruct. Lilith, Misato, his father, the attacking Angel and everybody who worked there had been vaporized. And not long after Asuka and Rei had failed in their own fight against the Angel, dying on the battlefield.  
但任务失败了。根据 NERV 作战部长葛城美里的命令，他的父亲——运营总监之下，中央复合体被设定为自毁。莉莉丝、美里、他的父亲、来袭的天使以及所有在那里的工作人员都被蒸发殆尽。不久之后，明日香和绫波在对抗天使的战斗中也失败了，战死沙场。

The only one left standing, piloting Unit-01, the Shinji Ikari of this world went insane, awakening to his powers, and ended up destroying the world in the process. Any who was alive had turned into a liquid known as LCL, their soul binding with others who had perished, into a ball of souls that now floated above the surface of the world, for eternity.  
唯一幸存者，驾驶着初号机，这个世界的碇真嗣陷入了疯狂，觉醒了自己的力量，结果在过程中毁灭了世界。所有活着的人变成了名为 LCL 的液体，他们的灵魂与其他逝者的灵魂融合，形成了一个漂浮在世界表面之上的灵魂球，永恒存在。

"That... is utterly insane."  
"那...简直是疯了。"

_"When I came to my senses, Unit-01 was empty, a lifeless husk. The soul of my mother just vanished, and starting from then, I was the only one left, not even alive, wandering the surface of this broken world. As alone as I had been that day father left me at that train station years ago."  
"当我回过神来，01 号机已是空壳一具，毫无生气。母亲的灵魂就这样消失了，从那时起，我成了唯一剩下的，甚至不算活着，在这破碎的世界表面徘徊。就像多年前父亲在火车站丢下我那天一样孤独。"_

"But... " Shinji hesitated. "Why are you...?"  
"但是... " 真嗣犹豫了一下。 "你为什么...？"

_"Why am I still here, and not together with the rest of the souls?" Ghost_ Shinji looked up at the blood-red sky.  
“为什么我还留在这里，而不是和其他灵魂在一起？”幽灵真嗣抬头望向血红的天空。

_"I think... it's the Curse of the Eva."  
“我想……这是 EVA 的诅咒。”_

In many ways, his answer made no sense at all. But in some ways, Shinji could understand. But he still couldn't understand why, after hearing his counterpart's story, he could believe the tale as easily as he could. As though a part of him had actually been here, experiencing the same things.  
从很多方面来说，这个回答毫无意义。但在某些方面，真嗣能够理解。然而他仍然不明白，为什么在听了另一个自己的故事后，他能如此轻易地相信这一切。仿佛他的一部分真的在这里，经历了同样的事情。

_"That's because I am you. And so are the other Shinji Ikari's in all the other world's that exist out there."_ Another hard-to-understand answer.  
"那是因为我就是你。还有其他所有存在的世界里的那些碇真嗣们，也都是你。" 又一个难以理解的回答。

_"When I achieved the power of a deity, I saw something. I was going through, as you can imagine, an incredible amount of emotional stress, but I clearly saw other worlds. Other Shinji Ikari's. Some of them were fighting the same fight I was. Some of them had won the fight and experienced a happy-ever-after. Some world's, like your own, didn't even experience the horror's and lived a relatively peaceful life, a normal life."_ His ghost looked wistful at the end.  
"当我获得了神一般的力量时，我看到了一些东西。你可以想象，我经历了极大的情感压力，但我清楚地看到了其他世界。其他的碇真嗣们。他们中的一些人在进行着和我一样的战斗。有些人赢得了战斗，体验了幸福美满的结局。有些世界，就像你所在的那个，甚至没有经历那些恐怖，过着相对平静的、正常的生活。" 他的幽灵在最后显得有些惆怅。

_"But for the world's that failed. For the worlds that didn't get a happy ending, what's left to do? How do I atone for destroying a world through insanity, and redo everything?"  
"但对于那些失败的世界。对于那些没有得到幸福结局的世界，还能做些什么呢？我该如何弥补因疯狂而毁灭一个世界的罪过，并重新来过呢？"_

Shinji looked worried as his ghost turned to him, a somewhat evil grin on his face.  
真嗣看起来很担忧，他的幽灵转向他，脸上带着一丝邪恶的微笑。

_"And that is the reason you are here. You, a being who is me from another world, have the power to fix what was broken. You are the hope that can save the souls circulating the planet, and return everything back to the way it was."_ Ignoring the living Shinji's jaw drop to the floor, the ghost continued.  
“这就是你在这里的原因。你，一个来自另一个世界的我，拥有修复破碎之力的存在。你是拯救环绕星球灵魂的希望，能让一切恢复原状。”无视着活着的真嗣下巴掉到地上的惊讶，幽灵继续说道。

_"You are my only hope."  
“你是我唯一的希望。”_

After several minutes of blind shock and his brain attempting to process everything he had just heard, he had only one question for his crazy reflection.  
在经历了数分钟的盲目震惊和大脑试图处理刚刚听到的一切之后，他只向自己疯狂的倒影提出了一个问题。

_**"How!?" “怎么可能！？”**_

---

"Shinji! SHINJI! Wake up, stupid idiot! We're going to be late for school!"  
“真嗣！真嗣！醒醒，笨蛋！我们上学要迟到了！”

A familiar voice was shouting at him. His mind felt groggy, like he hadn't slept for over a hundred years. Who was shouting at him?  
一个熟悉的声音在对他大喊。他的头脑昏沉，仿佛已有百年未曾入眠。是谁在对他喊叫？

"Shinji! Come on, get your ass out of bed, we gotta go!" He felt his body being shaken from the shoulders.  
“真嗣！快点，起床了，我们得走了！”他感到有人从肩膀处摇晃他的身体。

"Wait... what?" Shinji blearily opened an eye, and caught a blurry flash of orange hair and a set of bright red hair accessories.  
“等等...什么？”真嗣迷迷糊糊地睁开一只眼，瞥见一抹模糊的橙色头发和一对鲜红的头饰。

_It was her! 就是她！_

Sitting bolt upright in his bed, Shinji reached out and grabbed the suddenly very confused and flushed girl in front of him.  
真嗣猛地从床上坐直，伸出手抓住了面前突然变得非常困惑和脸红的女孩。

"S-shinji! What are you doing all of a... wait, _why are you crying!?"_  
“真-真嗣！你这是在干什么...等等，你为什么哭了！？”

"Asuka! I'm so... glad..." He didn't care he was probably gunking up her school uniform was snot and tears. "I'm glad... you're... okay..."  
"明日香！我真...高兴..." 他不在乎自己的鼻涕和眼泪可能弄脏了她的校服。"我很高兴...你...没事..."

"Of course I'm okay... why wouldn't I be?" The flustered girl tried grabbing his shoulders, but Shinji refused to let go. "Shinji, what the hell, did you have a nightmare or something?"  
"我当然没事...我怎么会不没事呢？" 慌乱的女孩试图抓住他的肩膀，但真嗣拒绝放手。"真嗣，搞什么鬼，你做了噩梦还是怎么了？"

_A nightmare...? 噩梦...？_

It took a few minutes, but eventually Shinji calmed down enough to let Asuka go, much to the annoyance of the two other girls waiting for him at his bedroom door. After making a quick excuse about having to get his clothes on, Shinji stood out of his bed and looked out of his bedroom window to a perfectly crystal clear blue sky. Everything was normal. Asuka, Rei and Mana were all alive, and judging from their reactions, everyone else was okay too. The world hadn't gone mad. Right?  
花了好几分钟，但最终真嗣平静到足以放开明日香，这让在他卧室门口等待的另外两个女孩感到非常恼火。在快速找了个借口说要穿衣服后，真嗣从床上站起来，望向窗外一片清澈湛蓝的天空。一切都很正常。明日香、丽和玛娜都还活着，从她们的反应来看，其他人也都安然无恙。世界并没有发疯。对吧？

"Was that really a dream? It felt so real..." Shinji murmured as he buttoned up his school shirt, absent-mindedly fiddling with his bracelet as he did so.  
“那真的只是一场梦吗？感觉如此真实……”真嗣喃喃自语，扣上校服衬衫的扣子，心不在焉地摆弄着手腕上的手链。

_"You'd be a fool for thinking that was a dream."  
“如果你认为那只是一场梦，那你就是个傻瓜。”_

Looking at his own reflection in the mirror, Shinji saw the unmistakeable visage of his ghostly counterpart from the destroyed world standing behind him, grinning madly.  
透过镜子看着自己的倒影，真嗣看到了那个来自毁灭世界的幽灵般的自己，正站在他身后，疯狂地咧嘴笑着。

_"I look forward to working with you, me."  
“我很期待与你合作，我。”_

Misato's entire apartment block echoed with screams of terror.  
美里整个公寓楼回荡着恐怖的尖叫声。

---

_That was certainly different, huh?  
那确实挺不一样的，对吧？  
This is the point where the main chunk of the story begins, and things get very, **very** confusing.  
故事的主线部分从这里开始，事情会变得非常非常混乱。_

_I can only hope that as I write, I can decipher this mess of a plot inside my head and turn it into a legible story.  
我只希望在写作的过程中，我能理清脑海中这团乱麻般的情节，并将其转化为一个清晰的故事。_

_Check my profile for further updates on the Facebook page and whatnot.  
查看我的个人资料，获取 Facebook 页面及其他更新的进一步信息。_

_Thanks for reading! 感谢阅读！  
Review if you enjoyed it or found my fictional ramblings confusing as hell! xD  
如果你喜欢它或觉得我的虚构胡言乱语令人困惑至极，请留下评论！xD_

### Chapter 12: Shadows

School was a relatively normal affair. Or at least, it would have been, had Shinji not been constantly glancing over his shoulder, mumbling something like _'He's still standing there...'_ over and over again. Asuka stared at the boy's back in front of her, wondering if he had finally snapped. He had screamed most of their neighborhood awake earlier, not to mention the unexplained 'nightmare' he'd had and the way he had...  
学校生活相对正常。或者说，如果没有真嗣不停地回头张望，嘴里还喃喃自语着‘他还在那里站着……’之类的话，本该是正常的。明日香盯着坐在她前面的男孩的背影，怀疑他是不是终于崩溃了。他之前尖叫声把整个街区的人都吵醒了，更别提他那莫名其妙的‘噩梦’和他那副样子……

Asuka blushed furiously as she remembered how tightly Shinji had been holding her earlier. She would have preferred a slightly more romantic situation, but her curiosity was starting to get the better of her. Why had he been crying? Why had he been acting like she had been killed or something?  
明日香想起真嗣之前紧紧抱着她的情景，脸颊顿时涨得通红。她本希望是个稍微浪漫点的场景，但她的好奇心开始占了上风。他为什么在哭？为什么表现得好像她已经死了似的？

By the window, Rei Ayanami was having similar thoughts, albeit with some jealousy of not having received a hug herself. Spinning her lead pencil in her hand, her crimson eyes glared at Shinji's back.  
窗边的绫波零也在思考类似的事情，尽管她心中有些嫉妒自己没有得到一个拥抱。她手中旋转着铅笔，赤红的眼眸盯着真嗣的背影。

There! He did it again. Looking over his shoulder, not at her, but at something in the back of the class, his eyes quivering as they found what they were looking for. Those same eyes quickly darted towards her, meeting her own, before quickly turning back to his desk, back hunched, sweating profusely.  
看！他又来了。他回头望去，不是看她，而是盯着教室后排的某个东西，眼神颤抖着找到了目标。那双眼睛迅速转向她，与她的目光相遇，然后迅速转回桌面，弯腰驼背，满头大汗。

What on Earth had Shinji Ikari so spooked?  
究竟是什么让碇真嗣如此惊慌？

Not being able to bear it any longer, both Rei and Asuka had frogmarched Shinji to the roof as soon as the lunch break bell had tolled, with Mana, Toji, Kensuke and Hikari following suit.  
再也无法忍受下去，午餐铃声一响，丽和明日香就强行把真嗣押到了屋顶，而真希、渡志、健介和光也紧随其后。

"Shin-man, you feeling okay?" Toji, ever-so-delicate in these situations, opened the interrogation as directly as possible. But to no avail.  
“真君，你感觉还好吗？”在这种场合总是格外细腻的渡志，尽可能直接地开始了询问。但毫无效果。

""I'm fine, I'm okay, **_I'm not crazy._**"  
“我没事，我很好，我没疯。”

"Shinji, no one's calling you crazy. Yet." Asuka was really beginning to consider calling the mad scientists Shinji had for parents, but felt it was best to wait just a little longer before calling in Shinji's funny farm family. The feeling was replaced with the idea that she should call in the big guns with all haste when she caught him looking at what must have been a strange looking patch of oxygen floating over her shoulder.  
"真嗣，没人说你疯了。至少现在还没有。" 明日香真的开始考虑给真嗣那对疯狂科学家父母打电话了，但她觉得最好还是再等一会儿再叫真嗣那帮古怪的家人来。当她看到他盯着她肩膀上方某个奇怪的漂浮氧气团时，这种感觉被一种迫切需要立即动用一切手段的想法所取代。

"Shinji, what in god's name are you looking at?" She groaned as she physically turned around to see what it was. But all she could see was the remainder of the roof, overlooking the school sport's field.  
"真嗣，你到底在看什么？" 她呻吟着，转身去看那是什么。但她只能看到剩下的屋顶，俯瞰着学校的运动场。

_"Wait a minute..."_ She squinted. Something was... bending light? Or at least, that was the only way she could accurately describe it. Something was weird with the air in the direction Shinji was looking at. Was she going crazy too?  
"等等……" 她眯起眼睛。有什么东西在……弯曲光线？或者至少，这是她能准确描述的唯一方式。真嗣所看的方向，空气有些奇怪。难道她也要疯了吗？

She was suddenly distracted by Rei standing up violently behind her. Her bracelet arm was outreached and pointing to the same patch of weirdness Asuka had been looking at.  
她突然被身后的丽猛地站起来的动作分了心。她的手镯手臂伸展开来，指向了与明日香所注视的同一片诡异区域。

_**"WHO ARE YOU?! SHOW YOURSELF!"**_ Everyone in the surrounding area jumped at Rei's sudden outburst. Hikari, who hadn't yet noticed the oddity in the air around them, giggled slightly.  
"你是谁？！现身吧！"周围的人都因丽的突然大喊而吓了一跳。尚未注意到周围空气中异样的光，轻声笑了起来。

"Rei, not you too. There's nobody the-..." Hikari's voice caught in her throat as she turned to face what everyone else was suddenly looking at.  
"丽，连你也这样。那里没有人——..."光的声音卡在了喉咙里，当她转身面对其他人突然注视的东西时。

And saw _Ghost_ Shinji, looking as maniacal as ever, grinning to the crowd of astounded teenagers. Save regular Shinji, who looked ready to climb over the roof's fencing and launch himself into oblivion.  
只见鬼面真嗣一如既往地狂态毕露，对着一群目瞪口呆的青少年咧嘴而笑。除了普通版的真嗣，他看起来已经准备好翻越屋顶的围栏，一头扎进虚无之中。

"What..." Asuka began. “什…” 明日香开口道。

"...the actual..." Toji continued.  
“…么鬼…” 东治接着说。

"...fuck." Rei finished, eyes wide in shock. Asuka tore her eyes away from the spectral version of Shinji for a moment to glare at the blunette.  
"...操。" 丽结束道，眼中满是震惊。明日香从幽灵般的真嗣身上移开目光，瞪向那位蓝红发色的女孩。

"Since when did you learn how to curse?"  
"你什么时候学会骂人的？"

_"I must admit, I'm just as surprised."_ Shinji's ghostly twin laughed, the same mirthless and almost evil laugh the original had heard before. _"The Ayanami in my world would have never done something like that."_  
"我必须承认，我同样感到惊讶。" 真嗣的幽灵双胞胎笑道，那笑声同样毫无欢乐，甚至带着几分邪恶，正如原版真嗣之前所听到的那样。"我那个世界的绫波绝不会做出这种事。"

"Your world?" Asuka whispered back, not sure she had understood what she had just heard. The Shinji she was now describing as _Shadow Shinji_ just laughed at her words, raising a hand.  
"你的世界？" 明日香低声回应，不确定自己是否听懂了刚才的话。她现在所描述的影之真嗣只是对着她的话嗤笑一声，举起一只手。

"NO, DON'T DO IT!" Shinji screamed, standing up, attempting to run towards the ghost.  
"不，不要这么做！" 真嗣尖叫着，站起身来，试图向幽灵跑去。

But he never made it. _Shadow_ Shinji had changed their world into the one from his dream, and once again the world was bathed in a crimson sky and destroyed remnants of what had once been society.  
但他终究未能抵达。影之真嗣已将他们的世界变成了他梦境中的模样，又一次，世界被浸染在猩红的天空下，曾经的社会遗迹如今只剩残垣断壁。

_"I told you before."_ Shinji faced his shadow, whose grin had turned into a deadly serious expression. _"You are my only hope. Save this world."_  
"我之前就告诉过你。" 真嗣面对着他的影子，那笑容已变得极其严肃。"你是我的唯一希望。拯救这个世界。"

"And I still don't have a clue how!" Shinji whimpered as he took a step back.  
"我还是不知道该怎么做！" 真嗣颤抖着后退了一步。

_"And that's why I have brought your friends along. A certain someone once told me..."_ Shadow Shinji glanced over at Rei. _"You are not alone."_  
"这就是为什么我带上了你的朋友们。某个人曾经告诉我……" 影子真嗣瞥了一眼绫波。"你并不孤单。"

---

"So you're telling me..." Asuka repeated for the umpteenth time. "That this is something like a parallel world to our own."  
"所以你是在告诉我..." 明日香不知第几次重复道，"这是一个类似于我们世界的平行世界。"

"With Evangelions..." Mana, her eyes stretched open wide, still hadn't recovered from the fact that her childhood-induced story about giant robots fighting weird aliens was a reality in this world.  
"还有使徒..." 玛娜瞪大了眼睛，仍然无法从她童年时编造的关于巨型机器人与奇怪外星人战斗的故事在这个世界成为现实的事实中恢复过来。

"And that everyone is dead, except they're all floating in that ball of souls..." Asuka continued, pointing towards the sky, where there was indeed an ethereal sphere the size of a huge moon swirling not far from the planet's surface.  
"而且除了他们都漂浮在那颗灵魂球里之外，其他人都死了..." 明日香继续说道，指向天空，那里确实有一个巨大的月亮般大小的灵性球体，不远处环绕着行星表面旋转。

"To top it all off, we're going to visit my corpse, after having just seen Ayanami's..." Asuka looked back at Rei with some degree of pity. She looked visibly traumatized and had thrown up outside the 'Entry Plug' after visiting her dead counterpart in this world. It hadn't given Asuka any confidence about how she was going to react herself, and she wasn't sure she really wanted to check out how her bones looked on the inside.  
“更糟糕的是，我们还要去看我的尸体，刚刚才见过绫波的……” 明日香回头看向绫波，眼中带着几分同情。她看起来明显受到了创伤，参观完这个世界的自己后，在‘插入栓’外呕吐不止。这让明日香对自己会作何反应毫无信心，她不确定自己是否真的想看到自己的骨骼内部是什么样子。

The trip to the remains of the Geofront was equally as spooky, with the whole group silent as they rode the tram to the underground. For his part, Shinji was surprised there actually _was_ still power for them to ride it. The familiar view of Unit 02's rotting corpse was back, a sight he was never going to get used to.  
前往地底都市遗迹的旅程同样阴森，一行人在电车上沉默不语。就他而言，真嗣惊讶地发现电车居然还有电力供应。熟悉的二号机腐烂残骸再次映入眼帘，这一幕他永远无法习惯。

"I still don't understand what you think we can do." Shinji said softly as he gazed over at the dead robot. His eyes briefly drifted over the second Entry Plug, their destination. His shadow smiled grimly.  
“我还是不明白你认为我们能做什么。” 真嗣轻声说道，目光投向那台废弃的机器人。他的视线短暂掠过第二个插入栓，那是他们的目的地。他的影子苦涩地笑了笑。

_"You'll see when we get there."  
“到了你就知道了。”_

They got there after several more minutes, and found themselves standing outside the Entry Plug. After several more minutes of deep breaths and panic, Asuka finally climbed into the hatch.  
又过了几分钟，他们到达了那里，发现自己站在插入栓外。经过几分钟的深呼吸和恐慌，明日香终于爬进了舱口。

An agonizing silence followed. Nobody else had dared go into the plug with her, wanting to respect her time alone with her deceased self. Shinji kept glancing over at his shadow self, who was looking oddly... concentrated on the plug in front of him. As though he was waiting for something.  
随后是一阵令人痛苦的沉默。没有人敢和她一起进入插入栓，大家都想尊重她与已故的自己独处的时光。真嗣不时瞥向自己的影子，他正奇怪地……专注地盯着眼前的插入栓。仿佛在等待着什么。

His patience had paid off. A scream echoed from inside the plug, reverberating through the chilled air of the ruined Geofront.  
他的耐心终于得到了回报。一声尖叫从插入栓内部传出，回荡在废墟般的 Geofront 冰冷的空气中。

"ASUKA!" Shinji ran to the plug's hatch, letting himself inside to save her.  
“明日香！” 真嗣奔向插入栓的舱门，让自己进入其中去救她。

What he saw stopped him in his tracks. The Asuka from his world was there, looking horrified as she pointed towards a second Asuka, clad in the crimson Plug Suit bearing Unit 02's insignia. And more importantly...  
他所见到的景象让他停下了脚步。他世界的明日香就在那里，惊恐地指着另一个明日香，后者身着红色插入栓服，上面印有二号机的标志。更重要的是……

This Asuka was no longer a corpse. She was a living, breathing, and very pissed Asuka who no longer looked nothing like a skeleton.  
这个明日香不再是尸体。她是一个活生生的、呼吸着的，而且非常愤怒的明日香，不再像一具骷髅。

_The dead had been resurrected.  
死者已被复活。_

---

**_"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, THIRD CHILD!?"  
“你他妈的以为自己在干什么，第三适格者？！”_**

The newly resurrected Asuka had living Shinji raised in the air by his shirt collar. Struggling for breath was about the best he could do as the raging girl continued to scream bloody murder at him.  
新复活的明日香将活着的真嗣揪着衣领提了起来。他挣扎着呼吸，已是所能做到的极限，而狂怒的女孩继续对他尖声咒骂。

_**"THE WORLD'S DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU!"  
“世界因你而灭亡！”**_

The screaming continued, shaking the living Shinji not only physically, but mentally.  
尖叫声持续不断，不仅在肉体上，也在精神上震撼着活着的真嗣。

_**"WHY!? WHY DID YOU DO IT!?"  
"为什么！？你为什么要这么做！？"**_

He could hear years of anguish and sorrow from the girl in front of him. Her eyes were wild with fury, and he was starting to worry that this Asuka was genuinely going to kill him.  
他能听到面前女孩多年来的痛苦和悲伤。她的眼睛因愤怒而狂野，他开始担心这个明日香真的会杀了他。

The rest of the gang piled in to separate the soon-to-be murder attempt, with Toji and Kensuke having to physically restrain the out-of-control redhead. Even with Toji's athletic build, he was still having trouble holding her still.  
其他团伙成员涌进来试图阻止即将发生的谋杀企图，东治和真希波不得不 physically 制住失控的红发女孩。即使东治有着运动员的体格，他仍然很难让她静止不动。

"Suzuhara!? You're supposed to be dead!" Her eyes bloodshot with fury, her rage quickly began to subside when this world's Asuka took a look around at the people in her vicinity.  
"铃原!? 你不是应该死了吗！" 她的眼睛因愤怒而布满血丝，但当这个世界的明日香环顾四周的人群时，她的怒气迅速开始消退。

"Hikari...?" The class president nodded nervously.  
"光...?" 班长紧张地点了点头。

"Aida?" Kensuke also nodded.  
"相田？" 健介也点了点头。

"How... are you...?" Raising her hands in front of her, she continued, her voice trembling. "How am I...?"  
"你...还好吗...？" 她双手举在身前，声音颤抖着继续说道。"我...还好吗？"

_"You've been resurrected. You are the first to come back."  
"你被复活了。你是第一个回来的。"_

Rage flashed through her eyes once again as this world's Asuka heard Shinji's voice. But when she turned to face the source, her rage once again vanished when she noticed it came not from the living, but from the ghost.  
当这个世界的小 Asuka 听到 Shinji 的声音时，她的眼中再次闪过愤怒。但当她转身面对声源时，发现那声音并非来自活人，而是来自幽灵，她的怒气再次消散了。

"What...?" She began, looking between the two Shinji's. "Why are there two of you? And why is one of you... dead?" Her gaze fixated itself on the ghostly Shinji.  
"什么...？" 她开始说道，目光在两个真嗣之间来回扫视。"为什么会有两个你？而且其中一个你... 是死的？" 她的视线定格在幽灵般的真嗣身上。

"Tell me everything." "告诉我一切。"

---

"So you're telling me..."  
"所以你是在告诉我..."

Déjà vu hit the group strong as the newly reborn, crimson-clad Asuka repeated for the umpteenth time. "That they're from something like a parallel world to our own?"  
似曾相识的感觉强烈地袭来，身着鲜红战衣、新生的明日香又一次重复道：“他们来自与我们平行的世界？”

"Is that how I honestly sound to other people?" The Asuka wearing her school uniform had her face in her hands as the group continued their trek back to the remains of Unit-00. Rei was glued to Shinji's arm, understandably panicking at the thought of having to go visit her corpse one more time.  
“我真的听起来是这样吗？”穿着校服的明日香双手捂脸，一行人继续向零号机残骸走去。绫波紧贴着真嗣的手臂，想到还要再次面对自己的尸体，不禁惊慌失措。

The idea was, just as they had done with Asuka, they were going to try and revive the Rei Ayanami from this world. However, according to the semi-living residents of this world, they needed to take utmost caution with this revival.  
他们的计划是，就像对待明日香那样，尝试复活这个世界的绫波丽。然而，根据这个世界的半生居民所说，这次复活需要极其谨慎。

One wrong move, and they could resurrect a hostile Angel.  
一步走错，他们就可能唤醒一个敌对的使徒。

The group as a whole were still a little unfamiliar with the concept of what these 'Angels' were, but something that sounded like a godsent alien bent on world destruction didn't sound like something they wanted to awaken anytime soon. Silence fell on the group as they continued walking, well aware that they could be walking towards their own doom.  
整个团队对这些‘使徒’的概念仍有些陌生，但听起来像是致力于世界毁灭的神赐外星生物，他们可不想在近期唤醒。随着他们继续前行，沉默笼罩着团队，他们深知自己可能正走向末日。

"And what about you?" The plugsuit-wearing Asuka asked her otherworld counterpart, who looked almost frightened of her destroyed world variant.  
“那你呢？”穿着驾驶服的明日香问她的异世界同位体，后者看起来几乎被她那被毁灭世界的变体吓坏了。

"W-what!?" "什-什么！？"

"I'm asking about your world." The two sides of the mirror had fallen back from the main group and were talking quietly amongst themselves. For her part, the Asuka who was alien to this world was still processing the fact that she was essentially talking to herself, realizing that she had no idea how to talk to a reflection that had clearly seen some traumatic stuff.  
""我在问你那个世界的事。"" 镜子两边的两人已经从主群中退开，正低声交谈着。对她而言，这个世界的明日香仍在消化自己实际上是在与自己对话的事实，意识到她完全不知道如何与一个显然经历过创伤的倒影交谈。

"My world? What about it?"  
"我的世界？它怎么了？"

"How are things any different from here?" Her doppelgänger waved her arm around, indicating the destruction around them. "How is your world different from a world that died fighting alien messengers of God?"  
"这里的情况有什么不同吗？" 她的分身挥动手臂，指向周围的破坏景象。"你的世界与一个在对抗外星神使的战斗中灭亡的世界有何不同？"

It took a while to formulate a response. She had no idea where to begin. How were the two worlds any different? The problem was basically everything was different.  
她花了些时间来组织回答。她不知道从何说起。这两个世界有何不同？问题在于基本上所有事物都不同。

"In my world... For the moment at least, everything is peaceful."  
"在我的世界... 至少目前，一切都是和平的。"

There were no Angels. Evangelions were apparently Mana's childhood-induced recipe for some crazy manga. Their godhand-powered bracelets were a thing, but she had still yet to master how to use it completely.  
没有天使存在。显然，《福音战士》是 Mana 童年幻想中对某部疯狂漫画的创作。那些由神之手力量驱动的手环确实存在，但她尚未完全掌握如何运用它们。

"The only thing I've had to worry about lately is some clandestine organization that apparently wants to steal the power of the bracelets. We have no idea what they want with them, but apparently you can take over the world or something if you know how to use them..." Asuka said sheepishly. She was almost ashamed at how little she actually knew about what they were up against.  
“最近我唯一需要担心的是某个秘密组织，他们似乎想窃取手环的力量。我们完全不知道他们要这些手环做什么，但据说如果你懂得如何使用它们，就能征服世界之类的……” 明日香有些尴尬地说道。她几乎为自己对即将面对的敌人知之甚少而感到羞愧。

"Who's trying to take them?"  
“谁在试图夺取它们？”

"Uhhh..." What were they called again?  
"呃..." 他们叫什么来着？

Mana had been a spy for them. Shinji's parents knew about them. It was on the tip of her tongue, but...  
Mana 曾经是他们的间谍。真嗣的父母知道他们。那个名字就在嘴边，但...

"Shinji!" She called out to live version, but both Shinji's turned around.  
"真嗣！" 她对着活生生的真嗣喊道，但两个真嗣都转过身来。

"What?" They said in unison.  
"什么？" 他们异口同声地说。

"Uhh, okay so this question is directed to the Shinji with a pulse, but what was the name of that creepy organization that wants to steal the bracelets?"  
"呃，好吧，这个问题是针对有脉搏的真嗣的，但那个想要偷手环的诡异组织的名字是什么？"

_Shadow_ Shinji had the audacity to look slightly offended, but the living Shinji just scratched his head. Mana fidgeted next to him, looking awkward as she remembered her previous employers.  
暗影真嗣竟然显得有些被冒犯，但活生生的真嗣只是挠了挠头。麻那在他旁边不安地扭动着，回想起她以前的雇主，显得有些尴尬。

"I think..." Shinji concentrated as he thought back to his 'interrogation' of Mana. "Weren't they called..." His eyes lit up as he remembered the elusive name.  
"我觉得..." 真嗣集中精神，回想起他对玛娜的'审问'。"他们不是被称作..." 他的眼睛一亮，想起了那个难以捉摸的名字。

"Seele?" "Seele？"

The temperature of the atmosphere dropped rapidly. The second the last syllable left Shinji's mouth, both the Asuka and Shinji from this world looked ready for murder.  
气氛温度骤降。最后一个音节从真嗣口中脱出的一刹那，这个世界的明日香和真嗣都露出了杀意。

_**"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!? SEELE!?"  
"你他妈的在逗我吗！？Seele！？"**_

_"This is bad."_ _Shadow_ Shinji looked at the living replica's with a deadly serious expression.  
"情况不妙。" Shadow Shinji 严肃地看着那些活生生的复制品。

_"If there's an incarnation of Seele in your world, we need to move fast."  
"如果你的世界里存在 Seele 的化身，我们必须迅速行动。"_

"Seele helped turned this world into the sea of crap it is. I don't care what world you're from, but Seele are bad news." The plugsuit Asuka grabbed the shoulders of her schoolgirl reflection, shaking them violently. "We need to do something to stop this from happening again!"  
“Seele 把这个世界变成了它现在的烂摊子。不管你来自哪个世界，Seele 都不是什么好东西。”穿着驾驶服的明日香抓住了她的学生装倒影的肩膀，猛烈地摇晃着。“我们必须做点什么，阻止这一切再次发生！”

The group fell silent once more after the outburst over Seele. They had made it out of the Geofront, and were slowly walking over the destruction of Tokyo-3 to where the remains of Unit-00 lay. Along the way, destroyed world's Asuka and Shinji explained the machinations of Seele, Gendo Ikari, the Angels and the Evangelions as briefly as they could.  
在关于 Seele 的爆发后，众人再次陷入了沉默。他们已经逃离了 Geofront，正缓缓走过被毁的第三新东京市，前往零号机残骸所在的地方。途中，来自毁灭世界的明日香和真嗣尽可能简短地解释了 Seele、碇源堂、使徒和 EVA 的阴谋。

To those from the peaceful world, it sounded worse than hell on Earth.  
对于来自和平世界的人来说，这听起来比地狱还要糟糕。

The brief history lesson was beginning to conclude when Unit-00 came into view once again. Rei whimpered at the sight of the intimidating Evangelion, clinging at Shinji's arm. He was sure his circulation was going to stop at any second with Rei's iron grip.  
历史课的简短讲解即将结束时，零号机再次映入眼帘。看到那令人畏惧的福音战士，绫波轻声呜咽，紧紧抓住真嗣的手臂。他确信，绫波那铁钳般的握力随时会让他的血液循环停止。

The two Asuka's were at the back of the group once again, mumbling about the differences between the two world's.  
两个明日香再次落在了队伍的后面，低声讨论着两个世界之间的差异。

"Wait, Rei and the idiot are technically engaged!? And that girl... Mana was it? She used to be a spy for Seele, but now work's for Shinji's parents as a bracelet-user and a double-agent to spy on Seele?" Plugsuit Asuka smiled grimly.  
“等等，绫波和那个白痴居然订婚了？！还有那个女孩……是叫麻奈吗？她曾是 Seele 的间谍，但现在为真嗣的父母工作，作为手环使用者和双重间谍监视 Seele？”穿着插头服的明日香苦笑了一下。

"She sounds like Kaji. And you're saying she likes Shinji too?"  
"她听起来像加持先生。你是说她喜欢真嗣吗？"

"Yup." "嗯哼。"

"And what about you?" Her plugsuit reflection asked nonchalantly.  
"那你呢？" 她插座服的倒影漫不经心地问道。

"Did your Shinji ever manage to topple the 'impenetrable wall of Jericho'?"  
"你的真嗣有没有成功推倒那座'坚不可摧的耶利哥墙'？"

"What in the world are you talking about!?" Asuka hissed at her irritating counterpart. She could hear hints of a sexual innuendo with the 'Jericho' spiel, and god knew her nerves weren't ready to begin thinking of how good Shinji might be in bed, her imagination immediately conjuring a muscular, shirtless Shinji with strong arms that wrapped around her like silk, pressing against her whilst they-  
"你到底在说什么鬼话！？" 明日香对她那烦人的对手低声咆哮。她能听出'耶利哥'这番话中隐含的性暗示，而天知道她的神经还没准备好开始想象真嗣在床上的表现，她的想象力立刻勾勒出一个肌肉发达、赤裸上身的真嗣，强壮的手臂像丝绸一样环绕着她，紧贴着她，而他们——

_"Oh my god, **STOP!**"_ Asuka internally screamed at her wildly out-of-control imagination.  
"哦天哪，停下！" 明日香在内心对着她那失控的想象力尖叫。

"Do you love him?" "你爱他吗？"

Looking ahead at where the living and Ghost Shinji were, walking towards their depressing destination, Asuka smiled at herself as she found her eyes fixated on the back of living Shinji's head.  
望着前方活生生的真嗣和幽灵真嗣走向那令人沮丧的目的地，明日香自嘲地笑了笑，发现自己目光紧盯着活生生的真嗣的后脑勺。

"Yeah, I do." "嗯，我爱他。"

The Asuka of this world smiled too, albeit a smile that looked almost sorrowful, as her line of sight found the back of Shadow Shinji's head.  
这个世界的明日香也笑了，尽管那笑容几乎带着一丝哀伤，她的视线找到了影子真嗣的后脑勺。

"That sounds kinda nice."  
“听起来挺不错的。”

---

Unlike when Asuka went to revive her other self, there was no feasible way the traumatized Rei was getting back into the Entry Plug by herself. Shinji went in first, holding Rei's hand. As irritated by the idea as she was, Asuka allowed it to happen, realizing they wouldn't get anywhere otherwise.  
与明日香去唤醒另一个自己时不同，受创的丽自己回到插入栓是不可能的。真嗣先进入，握着丽的手。尽管对此想法感到不悦，明日香还是默许了，意识到否则他们将无法前进。

Plugsuit Asuka glared angrily as Ghost Shinji, as though he had done something equally offensive. For his part, he just looked fairly confused.  
驾驶服的明日香愤怒地瞪着幽灵真嗣，仿佛他也做了什么同样冒犯的事。而他本人则显得相当困惑。

"No no no no..." Rei was wide-eyed in fear, crying behind Shinji as she looked at the skeletal remains of this world's version of herself, looking the same as the day Shinji first laid eyes on the corpse in the fetal position.  
“不不不不……” 绫波一脸惊恐，躲在真嗣身后哭泣，望着这个世界的自己那具骸骨，模样与真嗣初次见到那具蜷缩成胎儿姿势的尸体时如出一辙。

"I can't... I can't look at her... No, please, I need to get out of here..."  
“我做不到……我无法直视她……不，求你了，我必须离开这里……”

"It'll be fine Rei." Holding her hand tightly, Shinji silently begged the girl to stop crushing his arm, before he seriously considered amputating it. "I'm right here, it's going to be okay."  
"没事的，丽。" 真嗣紧紧握住她的手，默默祈求女孩不要再捏碎他的手臂，他甚至认真考虑过截肢。"我就在这里，一切都会好起来的。"

Crimson eyes looked up at him fearfully. Rei nodded silently as she raised her bracelet arm, pointing it towards the corpse. Shinji could hear the cerulean blue bracelet rattling with nerves as Rei held it towards her target. Wrapping an arm around her shoulder, Shinji felt the frightened girl calm down a little. Inhaling deeply, Rei held her breath for a moment, before exhaling her nerves, a sliver of determination returning to her eyes.  
绯红的眼眸带着恐惧望向他。丽默默点头，举起戴着手环的手臂，指向那具尸体。真嗣能听到那蔚蓝色的手环因紧张而颤动。他环抱住她的肩膀，感觉到受惊的女孩稍稍平静了一些。深吸一口气，丽屏息片刻，然后吐出紧张，眼中恢复了一丝坚定。

"Resurrection!" "复活吧！"

An eerily green glow surrounded the skeletal form of Rei Ayanami. Bones creaked, organs and skin rapidly regrew, all whilst the skeleton was pulled out of it's fetal position and into a sitting position on the Entry Plug's control seat. It was slightly gruesome to watch, but it was like watching a person melting in reverse. Bright blue hair regrew rapidly, and as a noticeable difference to Shinji, was growing way past Rei's normal hair length. It fell long, way past shoulder-length, and stopped at what he guessed would reach her lower back if she stood up.  
一种诡异的绿色光芒环绕着绫波零的骸骨形态。骨骼吱嘎作响，器官和皮肤迅速重生，与此同时，骸骨从胎儿般的蜷缩姿势被拉起，坐到了插入栓的控制座椅上。这一幕略显恐怖，但就像是在观看一个人在逆向融化。明亮的蓝发迅速重生，与真嗣不同的是，头发长度远超绫波平常的发长。它垂落得很长，远远超过了肩部，他猜测如果她站起来，会触及到她的腰部以下。

The frightened Rei had been watching in terror-stricken awe up until this point, when the skin on her face starting regrowing, and the corpse's eyes popped back into the sockets with sickening, slimy sound. Shinji's ears had started to ring with Rei suddenly screaming at the horrifying image.  
惊恐的绫波一直目瞪口呆地观看到这一刻，当她脸上的皮肤开始重生，那具尸体的眼睛令人作呕地、黏糊糊地弹回眼窝时，真嗣的耳朵被绫波突然的尖叫声震得嗡嗡作响。

But as quickly as it had all started, it was over. A fully-restored, plugsuit-clad Rei Ayanami from the destroyed world was sat in her chair, eyes closed but breathing.  
但这一切发生得快，结束得也快。一个完全恢复的、穿着驾驶服的绫波零，来自那个被毁灭的世界，坐在她的椅子上，双眼紧闭但呼吸平稳。

At Rei's scream, the rest of the group had clambered onto the Entry Plug and were now peering into the darkened depths.  
听到丽的尖叫声，其余的队员们纷纷爬进了插入栓，现在正探头向黑暗深处张望。

"Rei! Are you ok...ay..." Asuka started to shout into the plug, but stopped when she noticed the restored girl in the chair.  
“丽！你还好...好吧...”明日香开始对着插入栓大喊，但当她注意到椅子上恢复的女孩时，她停了下来。

"I... think so..." It hadn't been the Rei she was used to talking. The newly resurrected Rei had just awoken, rubbing her head as though some nameless pain was annoying her.  
“我... 我觉得还好...”这不是她习惯交谈的那个丽。新复活的丽刚刚醒来，揉着头，似乎有些莫名的疼痛在困扰着她。

And then she opened her eyes. Everyone present gasped in surprise as they noticed something else different to this version of Rei Ayanami. Her eyes were no longer the penetrating crimson they had been before.  
然后她睁开了眼睛。在场的人无不惊讶地发现，这个版本的绫波零有些不同。她的眼睛不再是之前那种深邃的猩红色。

Unit-00's Rei Ayanami, had bright green eyes. Eyes that looked around the plug around her, and in a scared voice, quietly whispered.  
零号机中的绫波零，拥有明亮的绿色眼睛。她的目光环视着周围的驾驶舱，然后用一种害怕的语气，轻声低语。

"Who are you?" “你是谁？”

_Been busy with that wonderful means of survival I call a 'day-job' lately, but been writing this one on and off for a couple weeks.  
最近忙于我称之为‘日间工作’的生存手段，但断断续续地写了几个星期。  
Honestly, the hardest bit of writing it was figuring out how to refer to the multiple versions of Shinji and Asuka.  
老实说，最难的部分是弄清楚如何称呼多个版本的真嗣和明日香。_

_You've got the peaceful world's varients, wielding bracelets, and then you've got the destroyed world's, Evangelion-piloting varients.  
你有和平世界的变体，戴着手镯，然后还有被毁灭世界的，驾驶 EVA 的变体。  
If anyone has better ideas, I'd love to hear them, because I went with whatever was rolling out of my brain at the time xD  
如果有人有更好的主意，我很乐意听听，因为我当时只是随脑子里冒出的念头行事 xD_

_Keep an eye on the Facebook page too (link in profile).

### Chapter 13: Advent Children  
第十三章：降临之子  

"W-what?" "什-什么？"

Asuka's stuttered response to their situation at large reflected what the group as a whole was thinking, regardless of what world they were from.  
对于当前的处境，明日香结结巴巴的回答反映了整个团队的想法，无论他们来自哪个世界。

This new Rei was an enigma.  
这个新的绫波丽是个谜。

At first, it appeared that her eyes were the only thing that were different, as well as the mountain of hair she had grown since her rebirth. But it rapidly became certain that there was a whole lot more going on behind those new leaf-colored irises. The only thing she seemed to remember for certain was her name.  
起初，似乎只有她的眼睛与众不同，还有她重生后长出的那一头浓密秀发。但很快，人们便确信在那双新叶般翠绿的瞳孔背后，隐藏着更多不为人知的秘密。她唯一能确切记得的，只有自己的名字。

She had no idea who the 'strange' people surrounding her were. She also didn't have a clue why she was sat in an odd pod-like object, wearing a peculiar skin-tight suit.  
她对周围这些自称‘陌生人’的家伙一无所知。同样，她也不明白自己为何会坐在一个奇异的豆荚状物体中，身着一件怪异的紧身衣。

She was even more confused by the girl clinging onto a certain somebody's arm that looked just like her.  
更让她困惑的是，有个女孩紧抓着某人的手臂，而那女孩的模样竟与她如出一辙。

Standing up, albeit a little wobbly, this world's Rei wombled over to the frightened Rei holding onto Shinji for dear life, and glared at her. The new Rei's extra-length hair curled around her body and fell in front of her face, which she fruitlessly tried to blow out of her field of vision.  
尽管有些摇晃，这个世界的丽还是站了起来，蹒跚地走向紧紧抱着真嗣、惊恐万分的丽，并瞪着她。新来的丽那异常长的头发环绕着她的身体，垂在脸前，她徒劳地试图吹开挡住视线的发丝。

"Who are you?" “你是谁？”

"I-I was k-k-kind of hoping I could ask you that..." Crimson-eyed Rei sort of whimpered into Shinji's back, the latter of whom was wondering if this wasn't all some insane hallucination.  
“我……我本来想问你这个的……”红眼丽有些颤抖地对着真嗣的背低声说道，后者则在想这是不是一场疯狂的幻觉。

"What is your name?" “你叫什么名字？”

"R-rei... Ayanami" "零...绫波"

"But... _I'm_ Rei Ayanami!"  
"但是...我是绫波零！"

As the two Rei's argued over who the real Rei was, _Ghost_ Shinji and Crimson Asuka were having a heated debate over the memory-loss of their once fellow pilot.  
当两位零争论谁才是真正的零时，幽灵真嗣和深红明日香正就他们曾经的战友失去记忆一事展开激烈的辩论。

_"Maybe it's amnesia?"_ _Shadow_ Shinji looked at the girl he had risked his life for countless times thoughtfully.  
“也许是失忆？”暗影真嗣若有所思地看着那个他曾无数次舍命相救的女孩。

"And amnesia somehow knocked the red right out of her eyes huh?"  
“失忆还能把她的红眼珠子给弄没了？”

_"You got any better ideas Asuka?"_ Shinji of the Dead glared at his former pilot-mate, who shot him an even more venomous glare right back.  
“你有更好的主意吗，明日香？”亡灵真嗣瞪着他的前驾驶员伙伴，后者回以更加恶毒的瞪视。

"Lilith is dead. You remember Lilith right? That godforsaken Angel we apparently had locked up in the basement at NERV?"  
"莉莉丝已经死了。你还记得莉莉丝吧？那个我们本以为被关在 NERV 地下室的该死的天使？"

_"You and Rei died before you guys even knew about Lilith, how do you know about that?"_ Crimson Asuka groaned before pointing towards the sphere of faintly screaming crazy that floated above their heads.  
""你们俩在知道莉莉丝之前就已经死了，你怎么会知道这些？"" 赤红的明日香呻吟着，然后指向悬浮在他们头顶上那个隐约发出疯狂尖叫的球体。

"Instrumentality. Or at least, the part of it that almost worked."  
"人类补完计划。或者至少，是差点成功的那个部分。"

_"Oh..." "哦..."_

"Is that, _'Oh, that Instrumentality, the one where humanity's every secret is laid bare to everyone_ _else'_ kind of 'Oh...'?"  
"是那种，‘哦，那个人类补完计划，就是把人类的每一个秘密都暴露给其他人’的那种‘哦...’吗？"

_"Ah..." Ghost_ Shinji didn't look too happy with what that apparently meant. Not that it meant much of anything to the rest of the group.  
""啊..."" 幽灵真嗣看起来对这个含义并不太高兴。不过这对其他人来说也没什么意义。

"And you know what, whilst we're on the subject, I saw all kinds of other worlds where we were fighting Angels and crap. There was this one world where you were standing over me whilst I was comatose in a hospital bed..."  
"你知道吗，既然我们谈到了这个话题，我看到了各种各样其他的世界，我们在那里与天使和垃圾战斗。有一个世界，你站在我旁边，而我昏迷在医院病床上..."

_**"DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD ASUKA!"  
"别再说了，明日香！"**_

**"DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO THIRD CHILD!"** After her roar of fury that silenced the whole group, Asuka continued bitterly.  
""别命令我，第三适格者！"" 在她愤怒的咆哮让整个小组都安静下来后，明日香继续苦涩地说道。

"Who even does that? Who faps to an unconscious girl in a hospital bed, seriously?"  
"谁会那么做？对着医院床上昏迷的女孩自慰，真的有人会这样吗？"

**"YOU DID WHAT!?"** It was the other Asuka's turn to scream, picking up the living Shinji by his shirt collar, shaking him around like a leaf in a hurricane. **"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO ME WHILST I WAS ASLEEP YOU FAPPY BASTARD!?"**  
"你干了什么！？" 轮到另一个明日香尖叫了，她抓起活着的 Shinji 的衣领，像飓风中的树叶一样摇晃他。"我睡着的时候你对我做了什么，你这个自慰的混蛋！？"

"I...didn't...do...anything." Shinji managed to choke out whilst being subject once again to another angry Asuka's screaming two feet off the ground.  
"我...没...做...任何事。" Shinji 在被另一个愤怒的明日香再次尖叫着举到离地两英尺的地方时，勉强挤出了这句话。"

_"And not to mention..."_ _Ghost_ Shinji said adamantly. _"This was a Shinji who existed in another world. Neither him..."_ He pointed to his other self currently getting asphyxiated. _"Nor me did anything like that! We're innocent!"_  
"而且更不用说..." 幽灵真嗣坚定地说道。"这是一个存在于另一个世界的真嗣。无论是他..." 他指向正在被勒得窒息的另一个自己。"还是我，都没有做过那种事！我们是清白的！"

Crimson Asuka shot the ghost a livid look that would shake hell to it's very foundations.  
绯红明日香向幽灵投去一个足以撼动地狱根基的愤怒眼神。

"You. Destroyed. The. World." She was seething with every syllable. The people around her were genuinely surprised she wasn't spitting fire. "If you weren't already dead, I'd kill you myself, here and now!"  
"你。毁灭。了。世界。" 她每个音节都带着怒火。周围的人真切地惊讶她没有喷出火焰。"如果你还没死，我现在就亲手杀了你，就在这里！"

"And...you do...all that weird stuff...to me...when _I'm_ sleeping..." Meanwhile, living Shinji, on the verge of oxygen-deprived unconsciousness, blurted out something that caused the whole group to rapidly change their attention to the other fight.  
“而...你对我...做了那些奇怪的事...当我睡着的时候...”与此同时，现实中的真嗣因缺氧即将昏迷，脱口而出的话让整个团队迅速将注意力转向了另一场战斗。

_"You..."_ Now it was _Ghost_ Shinji's turn to look creeped out. "You utter hypocrite..."  
“你...”现在轮到幽灵真嗣露出惊恐的表情了。“你这个彻头彻尾的伪君子...”

With a face as rougé as her plugsuit, Crimson Asuka was at a loss for words. She just looked at her otherworld counterpart with a horrified expression. She only had one, despair-filled word to give.  
面色如她驾驶服般粗糙的赤红明日香，一时语塞。她只是惊恐地看着另一个世界的自己。她只能用一个充满绝望的字眼回应。

_"Why...?" “为什么...？”_

"_THAT'S NOT... THAT'S... ARRGGHHHHHHH!_" With her scream gurgling in frustration in her throat, the other Asuka dropped the near-dead Shinji unceremoniously on the ground, and started to back away from Mana and red-eyed Rei, both pointing charged bracelets at her.  
“那不是...那不是...啊啊啊啊啊啊！”随着一声因沮丧而哽咽的尖叫，另一个明日香粗鲁地将濒死的真嗣扔在地上，开始从手持充电手环的 Mana 和红眼丽两人面前退开。

"Today's been an odd kind of day, huh guys?" Hikari had been mostly silent for the whole trip. But with her first bit of dialogue since they left the school roof, Toji and Kensuke agreed. It had certainly been an odd kind of day.  
“今天真是奇怪的一天，对吧，伙计们？”从离开学校屋顶后，光一直保持沉默。但当她第一次开口时，冬二和健司都表示同意。这确实是非常奇怪的一天。

---

"So the plan is, we go back to our world, find out as much as we can about the bracelets, Seele, and anything we could potentially use to fix this world." Shinji said as his ghostly counterpart nodded.  
“所以计划是，我们回到我们的世界，尽可能多地了解关于手镯、Seele 以及任何可能用来修复这个世界的信息。”真嗣说道，他的幽灵分身点了点头。

_"We can't do anything here at the moment. The Angels no longer exist and have no reason to attack even if they did. Rei's new look seems to lend some credence to that theory." Ghost_ Shinji looked at the new Rei. _"Though I would like to know where her memories ran off to."_  
“我们目前在这里无事可做。使徒已不复存在，即使它们还在，也没有理由攻击。丽的新形象似乎印证了这一理论。”幽灵真嗣看着新的丽，“不过我想知道她的记忆跑到哪里去了。”

The group assembled together, getting ready for departure. Shinji, looking a little worse for wear after Asuka's rough treatment, was looking forward to going home. He really didn't like the death-riddled atmosphere of this world.  
众人集结完毕，准备启程。经历了明日香粗暴对待的真嗣显得有些憔悴，他期待着回家。他实在不喜欢这个充满死亡气息的世界氛围。

Raising his hand, _Ghost_ Shinji began to talk as his world started to fade away to black.  
他举起手，幽灵真嗣开始说话，与此同时，他的世界逐渐淡入黑暗。

_"Looking forward to our new life together."_ His maniacal grin was back, bringing with it some unpleasant thoughts.  
“期待我们共同的新生活。”他那疯狂的笑容再次浮现，随之而来的是一些令人不快的念头。

"What did he mean by..." Before he could finish, Shinji found himself sitting on the roof of the school once again. It was night time, so they must have been in the otherworld for a lot longer then they all realized.  
“他那句话是什么意思……”还没等他说完，真嗣发现自己又一次坐在了学校的屋顶上。此时已是夜晚，这意味着他们在异世界度过的时间比他们意识到的要长得多。

"We've missed all our afternoon classes!?" Hikari shrieked when she realised what time it was. "My perfect attendance record, gone..."  
“我们错过了下午所有的课！？”光意识到时间后尖叫起来，“我的全勤记录，没了……”

While the class president cursed the ghost for his awful sense of timing, the rest of the group began to head home, thoroughly exhausted after the events of the day.  
当班长咒骂着幽灵糟糕的时间感时，其他人都开始回家了，经过一天的事件后，他们已经筋疲力尽。

Not a word was said as they all left the building. Quick goodbyes were shared as Kensuke, Hikari who was still sobbing, and Toji, attempting to comfort the girl left to go their separate ways home.  
他们离开大楼时，没有一个人说话。简短地道别后，真希、仍在啜泣的光，以及试图安慰她的冬二，各自踏上了回家的路。

Which left the awkward atmosphere shared by Asuka, Shinji, Rei and Mana as they slowly walked the familiar route back to their abode. It was only when Misato's apartment building started coming into view that Asuka suddenly spoke up.  
这让明日香、真嗣、丽和玛娜之间弥漫着尴尬的气氛，他们缓缓沿着熟悉的路线走回住处。直到美里公寓的楼宇开始映入眼帘，明日香才突然开口。

"Well, at least you aren't crazy!"  
“好吧，至少你没疯！”

The others turned to look at her, deadpan expressions everywhere.  
其他人转头看向她，脸上尽是面无表情。

"What?" "什么？"

"Shinji, the second you get home you need to summon and install a lock for your door."  
"真嗣，你一回家就得召唤并安装一个门锁。"

"I'm starting to think a lock isn't going to be enough Rei."  
"我开始觉得光有锁可能不够，绫波。"

"She has a bracelet too. A molester with the powers of a deity... That's terrifying when you think about it."  
"她也有一个手镯。一个拥有神力的骚扰者...想想就可怕。"

**"WHAT THE HELL!?"** Asuka yelled furiously at the rest of them. **"I'D NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT!"**  
"搞什么鬼！？" 明日香愤怒地对其他人吼道，"我绝不会做那种事！"

"I dunno... History's telling us that you're lying and horny as hell."  
"我不确定...历史告诉我们，你在撒谎，而且欲望强烈得要命。"

"I could say the same to you Mana Kirishima!"  
"我也可以这么对你说，Mana 雾岛！"

"She could turn herself invisible, create a portal in her room that opens up in his, hypnotise him into sharing her wildest fetishes... _gehehehe_..." Rei had started to drool with a goofy grin as she counted all the things that could be done with the powers they all shared.  
"她可以让自己隐形，在房间里开一个通往他那里的传送门，催眠他分享她最狂野的癖好...嘿嘿嘿..." Rei 开始流着口水，带着傻笑，一一列举他们共享的超能力能做的事情。

"You could turn him into a girl for a day... Shapeshift him into any form you could think of... Drown his body in chocolate..." Mana wore an identical expression to Rei as Shinji began running for the questionable sanctity of his room.  
"你可以让他变成女孩一天...随心所欲地变形他...用巧克力淹没他的身体..." Mana 的表情和 Rei 如出一辙，而 Shinji 则开始向着他房间那可疑的避难所狂奔。

"You three are freaking me out! You're all perverted!"  
"你们三个真是吓到我了！一个个都这么变态！"

Making it up to the apartment door a few minutes later, Shinji stopped to catch his breath before he opened the way into his veritable prison. Getting his keycard out of his bag, he hastily swiped it, intending to lock himself in his room and reinforce it as much as possible as the receiver beeped and a green light shone into his eyes, allowing him access.  
几分钟后，终于爬到公寓门口，真嗣停下来喘口气，然后才打开通往他那名副其实的牢笼的门。他从包里拿出钥匙卡，急忙刷了一下，打算把自己锁在房间里，尽可能加固防御，随着接收器发出哔声，绿灯照进他的眼睛，门开了。

Taking three steps into his home, he dropped everything he was holding as he saw the only thing that could possibly make his day a hell of a lot worse.  
走进家门三步，他丢下了手里的一切，因为他看到了唯一能让今天变得更糟糕的东西。

"Shinji, how the hell have you gotten so much faster..." Asuka huffed and wheezed as she made it to the door behind him. Looking up at the sight that Shinji saw, she wanted to scream agony to the center of the world.  
"真嗣，你怎么可能变得这么快..." 明日香喘着粗气，终于追到了他身后的门口。抬头看到真嗣所见的景象，她真想向世界中心发出痛苦的尖叫。

_"Welcome home guys, you sure are late!"  
"欢迎回家，你们确实回来得晚了！"_

_Ghost_ Shinji, Crimson Asuka, who was wearing what looked like the original's yellow sundress that was surely appropriated from the fuming girl's wardrobe and green-eyed Rei, wearing what looked like Asuka's short, black skirt and white tank top that also appeared to come from the same source, were all sitting on the couch watching what looked like a magical girl anime on TV.  
幽灵真嗣、绯红明日香，她穿着一件看起来像是原版明日香的黄色太阳裙，肯定是出自那位愤怒女孩的衣橱，还有绿眼的丽，穿着明日香那条短黑色裙子和白色背心，同样似乎来自同一个来源，他们全都坐在沙发上，看着电视上播放的魔法少女动漫。

The scene was wrapped up nicely by a clearly insane looking Misato sitting at the kitchen table, which was overladen with various types of strong spirits. A bottle of tequila was open and half-empty as the crazed woman looked at the front door, smiling with what looked like the intention that she wanted to eat them alive.  
场景被一个明显看起来精神错乱的美里紧紧包裹着，她坐在餐桌旁，桌上堆满了各种烈酒。一瓶龙舌兰酒已经打开，半空着，这个疯狂的女人盯着前门，微笑着，似乎想要把他们生吞活剥。

"Guyz! Can you *_hic*_ tell the school tomorrow... that I'z taking a sick day? Or..." She finished the glass of straight tequila in her hand in one gulp. "geurhhh... or a *_hic_* mental health day?"  
“伙计们！你们能*打嗝*告诉学校明天...我请病假吗？或者...”她一口气喝完了手中的那杯纯龙舌兰酒。“呃...或者*打嗝*心理健康假？”

"Um... Misato, we can explain..." Shinji sheepishly tried to reassure the clearly shaken Misato, whilst wondering where on earth he would begin with this latest series of events.  
“嗯...美里，我们可以解释...”真嗣怯生生地试图安抚明显受到惊吓的美里，同时疑惑着该如何开始解释这一连串的最新事件。

"No need! Those three told me everything!" She wobbled an arm towards the inhabitants of her couch.  
"不用了！那三个人已经告诉我一切了！" 她摇晃着胳膊指向沙发上的居民们。

"Two Ashuka's, a Rei that had a major makeover where she traded all her memories and a dead Shinji that destroyed another world! With alienz and shtuff!" She burped as she poured herself another strong drink in front of the aghast Shinji, whilst the couch-side Asuka snickered.  
"两个明日香，一个经历了大改造的绫波，她用所有记忆做了交换，还有一个毁灭了另一个世界的死去的真嗣！还有外星人和各种东西！" 她一边为目瞪口呆的真嗣面前倒了一杯烈酒，一边打着嗝，而沙发旁的明日香则窃笑不已。

"Some things never change."  
"有些事情永远不会改变。"

"Wait til Mama Ikari finds out about thiz! She's gonna blow a musket! Cheers!" Misato giggled as she raised her glass in the air, before promptly passing out on the table, the contents of her glass spilling out all over the table.  
"等妈妈碇源堂发现这事！她会气得七窍生烟！干杯！" 美里咯咯笑着举起酒杯，随即一头栽倒在桌上，杯中酒洒得满桌都是。

The night was only beginning, but Shinji realized he might need a day off school tomorrow too, if only to have any chance in hell of sorting out all the mess that had happened tonight.  
夜幕才刚刚拉开，但真嗣意识到，如果明天还想有机会理清今晚的烂摊子，他可能也得请一天假。

But when he finally managed to clear Misato and her assortment of strong alcohol off the table and get her into bed, the others had all already gone to bed, doppelgängers with their respective originals, and had the terrifying prospect of having to sleep in a room with a ghost standing watch over him all night.  
但当他终于设法将美里和她那一堆烈酒从桌上清理干净并安顿她上床时，其他人早已各自与分身一同入睡，而他则面临着与一个整夜守在房间里的幽灵共眠的可怕前景。

"Please don't do anything strange to me."  
"请不要对我做奇怪的事。"

_"I would never dream of it."_ His ghost snickered as he lay on the floor. Something in his voice told Shinji he wasn't to be trusted.  
""我绝不会有那种念头。"" 他的幽灵躺在地板上窃笑。他声音里的某种东西告诉真嗣，他不可信任。

Needless to say, the living schoolboy never got a wink of sleep that night.  
不用说，那个活着的学童那晚彻夜未眠。

### Chapter 14: Asuka Vamp Omake  
第十四章：明日香吸血鬼番外  

_Several beers and a bottle of red wine, then this happened.  
几杯啤酒和一瓶红酒下肚，然后就发生了这事。  
I have no regrets. 我毫不后悔。_

---

It had got to the point that they were sick of their regular nightly entertainment. Between them, Shinji and Asuka had somehow managed to binge every optical-disc based movie in the house, watched almost the entire catalog that Netflix and the other entertainment services had to offer them and Japanese reality TV was something they had never had the energy to bother with.  
事情已经到了他们厌倦了常规夜间娱乐的地步。在真嗣和明日香之间，他们不知怎么地竟然把家里所有光盘电影都看完了，几乎看遍了 Netflix 和其他娱乐服务提供的全部内容，而日本真人秀则是他们从未有精力去关注的。

At his suggestion they could watch an anime or something, Asuka rolled her eyes and started thumbing through their DVD collection. She enjoyed certain anime but everything she could remember they'd ever bought a physical copy for had been over-watched to death.  
在他提议看一部动漫或其他什么的时候，明日香翻了个白眼，开始翻阅他们的 DVD 收藏。她喜欢某些动漫，但她记得他们买过的所有实体副本都已经看得烂熟了。

"How do you feel about an older series?"  
“你觉得老一点的系列怎么样？”

"If it's _Angel Beats_, no. I can't remember the last time I cried that hard at an anime."  
"如果是《Angel Beats》的话，不。我都不记得上次看动漫哭得那么惨是什么时候了。"

"Jesus almighty, help this boy put his balls back in before I permanently confiscate his man card..."  
"天哪，帮这小子把他的蛋蛋放回去吧，不然我可要永久没收他的男人卡了……"

"You were crying too Asuka! And don't get me started on what you were like with _Clannad_."  
"你也在哭啊，明日香！还有别提你看《CLANNAD》时那副样子了。"

She popped one of the discs out of the case and slid it into their player sitting comfortably under the TV.  
她从盒子里弹出一张光盘，轻轻地放入电视机下方的播放器中。

"This coming from the guy who wept uncontrollably at _Your Lie in April_."  
“这话居然出自那个看《四月是你的谎言》哭得稀里哗啦的家伙。”

"It's a tragic story involving musicians. _I play the damn cello_. I felt that one on a spiritual level."  
“那是个关于音乐家的悲剧故事。我拉大提琴的，那感觉真是触及灵魂。”

"What an idiot..." She sighed as she hunted for the remote. As she looked under the couch for the whereabouts of the essential device, the main menu for the series popped up on the screen, revealing her chosen title for the evening.  
"真是个傻瓜..." 她叹了口气，四处寻找遥控器。当她在沙发下寻找这个必需品时，屏幕上弹出了该系列的主菜单，揭示了她当晚选择的标题。

"Wait, why this?" Shinji eyed the name dancing in front of him on the screen. He definitely liked the series, but what worried him was that Asuka didn't show much interest in it the last time they'd watched it. Or so he had thought.  
"等等，为什么是这个？" 真嗣盯着屏幕上跳动的名字。他确实喜欢这个系列，但让他担心的是，上次他们一起看的时候，明日香似乎并没有表现出太多兴趣。至少他是这么认为的。

"I guess I'm in the mood for it."  
"我想我现在正想看这个。"

"Mood for what?" "什么的心情？"

She turned round, showing Shinji the sneaky expression in her eyes.  
她转过身来，眼中闪烁着狡黠的光芒，让真嗣看得一清二楚。

_"Vampires." "吸血鬼。"_

---

"You say vampires, but..." They'd just finished episode three of _Bakemonogatari_. It was certainly a story about vampires, but it was also about a ton of other supernatural oddities, the latest being a story about the ghost of a young girl.  
"你说吸血鬼，但是..." 他们刚看完《化物语》的第三集。这确实是一个关于吸血鬼的故事，但也涉及了一大堆其他超自然怪谈，最近的一集讲的是一个年轻女孩的幽灵。

Something was up. He could tell that Asuka wasn't paying attention to the series at all without even looking at her.  
有些不对劲。他甚至不用看就能感觉到，明日香根本没在关注这部系列。  
But when he did decide to finally glance at her, watching an anime suddenly became the furthest thing from his mind.  
但当他最终决定瞥她一眼时，看动漫突然成了他最不关心的事。

Asuka Langley Soryu, his resident pain-in-the-butt and childhood friend/hot roommate, was wearing a black one-piece, slightly translucent dress that barely had the decency to cover a minuscule amount of thigh. Kneesocks of an equally dark color filled in starting from her toes, and she had what looked like arm warmers made of a translucent, thin material on her arms. Her hair was the color of the night, her eyes had enough mascara to make a gothic visual-kei-lolita proud and most importantly...  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷，他那既麻烦又青梅竹马/火辣室友，正穿着一件黑色连体裙，这件略带透明的裙子勉强算是遮住了她那微乎其微的大腿。同样深色的膝袜从脚尖开始包裹，而她手臂上似乎是透明薄材质的臂套。她的发色如夜幕般深沉，眼妆浓重得足以让一位哥特视觉系洛丽塔自豪，而最重要的是……

He could see what looked like _fangs_ in her mouth.  
他能看到她嘴里似乎露出了尖牙。  
The same mouth that was grinning, whilst those eyes were staring at him, _hungrily_.  
那张嘴正咧着笑，而那双眼睛则饥渴地盯着他。

"A-Asuka...? Are you doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doin-... _What are you doing!?_" Shinji tried his best to keep his words straight whilst simultaneously backing away from what he hadn't yet decided could be his hottest nightmare ever.  
"A-明日香...? 你...嘟-嘟-嘟-嘟-嘟-嘟-在...你在做什么!?" 真嗣尽力保持语句连贯，同时从他尚未确定是否是他最热烈的噩梦的东西中退缩。

"Do you prefer this kind of vampire, _Shinjiiii~?_" Asuka purred as she closed the distance between them with a pounce, pinning his arms against the couch. He could feel himself losing his grip on a lot of things, such as sanity, reason and oddly enough, his chastity seemed to be slipping away, getting ready to depart forever.  
"你喜欢这种吸血鬼吗，真嗣~?" 明日香低声呢喃，一跃而起缩短了他们之间的距离，将他的手臂按在沙发上。他感到自己正在失去许多东西，比如理智、理由，奇怪的是，他的贞操似乎也在悄然溜走，准备永远离去。

"Th-this is a blatant... abuse of your bracelet... Ah-Asuka..."  
"这-这是对你手镯的...公然...滥用...啊-明日香..."

"Are you seriously complaining about having a hot vampire girl on top of you?"  
"你真的在抱怨有个性感的吸血鬼女孩压在你身上吗？"

_"I-I'm... trying to..." "我...我...正在努力..."_

"So you want me to stop?"  
"所以你是想让我停下来？"

Shinji's only response was a muffled whimper as he felt Asuka trace circles on his neck seductively.  
真嗣唯一的回应是一声闷闷的呜咽，他感觉到明日香在他脖子上挑逗地画着圈。

"I'm not hearing a no." Her voice was whispering into his ear, as Shinji suddenly felt like a puddle of hormones melting into the couch's soft fabric underneath him.  
“我没听到拒绝哦。”她的声音轻柔地在他耳边响起，真嗣突然觉得自己像是一滩荷尔蒙，融化在身下柔软的沙发里。

"And I'm not hearing you repenting for your transgressions either!"  
“你也没有为你的过错忏悔的意思！”

"And what do I need to repent for?" She gently nibbled the lobe of his ear with one of those godforsakenly-sexy fangs. "I'm not known for my good deeds. And I don't intend to become an angel anytime soon either."  
"我需要忏悔什么？" 她用那该死的性感尖牙轻轻咬住他的耳垂。"我可不是以善行著称的。而且我也不打算很快变成天使。"

With no time left before lines were crossed, Shinji had to come up with a plan. And the only one that seemed to filter through his brain...  
在界限即将被跨越之前，没有时间了，真嗣必须想出一个计划。而唯一似乎能从他脑海中浮现的……

...had seemed like a good one at the time.  
……在当时似乎是个好主意。

"Are you-... wait, _what?!_" Asuka looked at the glowing boy underneath her, his bracelet glowing. Her eyes stung from the bright light a little, but as soon as it had appeared, it faded away. Leaving behind...  
"你...等等，什么？！" 明日香看着身下发光的男孩，他的手镯在发光。她的眼睛因强光而有些刺痛，但光芒一闪即逝，留下的是...

_"S-shi...n...ji?" "真...希...吗？"_

Asuka wasn't sure anymore. The Shinji Ikari she had been straddling until moments ago... _was now a_ _**girl**__?_  
明日香不确定了。直到片刻前她还骑在身上的碇真嗣...现在变成了一个女孩？

'She' had long, black hair and was wearing the same school uniform the girls would wear going to their school. Her body was slender, and she was about the same as Asuka in the breasts department. But this girl had Shinji's face. And somehow, it suited better than when it had been on a boy's body!  
"“她”有着一头乌黑的长发，身穿与女孩们上学时相同的校服。她的身材苗条，胸部大小与明日香相仿。但这位女孩却有着真嗣的脸庞。不知为何，这张脸放在她身上比在男孩身上更合适！

"I mean, hey! If you gotta cockblock somebody, you might as well get rid of the coc-... turn into the opposite of a guy..." Shinji, with a considerably more feminine voice, said sheepishly.  
“我是说，嘿！如果你想阻止某人，你不妨……摆脱那……变成一个与男性相反的人……”真嗣用明显更女性化的声音尴尬地说道。

"I-... what?!" Asuka did not have a clue how to deal with this. A sentiment felt by the rest of her housemates who had just chosen that exact moment to return home.  
“我……什么？！”明日香完全不知道该如何应对这种情况。她的室友们也刚刚在那一刻回到了家，同样感到困惑。

"So I'm going to need you two..." Misato, wide-eyed and very much bushy-tailed, directed her dialogue to the equally shocked Rei and Mana standing at her sides. "To tell me if you see a vampiric Asuka, straddling what looks to be a genderbent Shinji?"  
"所以，我需要你们两个..." 美里瞪大了眼睛，精神抖擞地对同样震惊的丽和玛娜说道。"告诉我，如果你们看到一个吸血鬼化的明日香，骑在一个性别转换的 Shinji 身上？"

"Misato..." "美里..."

"Yes, Rei?" "是的，丽？"

"Could you admin-lock their bracelets?"  
"你能把他们的手环管理锁定吗？"

The deed was done. And for the rest of the weekend, Asuka remained a vampire in her goth outfit, whilst Shinji spent the remainder of his free days without a certain little friend of his.  
事情就这样完成了。整个周末，明日香依旧是一身哥特装扮的吸血鬼，而真嗣则在没有某个小家伙陪伴的情况下度过了剩余的自由时光。

...Not that it seemed to faze the three girls in the slightest.  
...似乎这对三位女孩丝毫没有影响。

If anything... 如果有什么的话...

Their pursuit of him was a horrifyingly lot more aggressive than usual.  
他们对他的追逐比平时要可怕得多，更加咄咄逼人。

### Chapter 15: Breathless
第十五章：屏息

School was... different. Everyday there had been something new to keep the gossip flowing like a giggling hurricane through the lively corridors. It usually centered on a certain classroom, with four certain individuals targeted in the crosshair. Today, there was none of the usual gossip.  
学校变得...不同了。每天都有新鲜事让八卦像咯咯笑的飓风一样在热闹的走廊里流传。通常这些八卦都围绕着某个教室，针对四个特定的人。但今天，没有往常的流言蜚语。

Only shock and disbelief.  
只有震惊和难以置信。

Some students were questioning their sanity. Others were asking their teachers, who failed to come up with any reasonable answers, just as clueless as those in their care. One such teacher was in a similar position, albeit incredibly hungover.  
有些学生开始质疑自己的理智。其他人则向老师求助，但老师们同样无法给出任何合理的解释，与他们所照顾的学生一样茫然。其中一位老师也处于类似的困境，尽管她宿醉未醒。

Misato Katsuragi stood behind her desk, sighing. Shinji's apparently brilliant scientist parents had no answers for her, likewise with Asuka's mom. Her own, usually perceptive brain, had nothing, no logical explanation for the unusual apparition of trouble that had overtaken her apartment the night before. It only provided disturbing thoughts about what the future might hold for their everyday lives.  
葛城美里站在讲台后，叹了口气。真嗣那对显然才华横溢的科学家父母无法给她答案，同样地，明日香的母亲也是如此。她自己通常敏锐的头脑也一片空白，对于昨晚突如其来的麻烦现象，没有任何逻辑上的解释。这只能让她对未来日常生活的可能走向感到不安。

"Alright, come in guys. Let's make this as painless as possible, _if at all possible..._"  
“好了，大家进来吧。让我们尽可能让这一切不那么痛苦，如果可能的话……”

The door to the classroom slid open. Nobody in the class needed to guess who was going to walk through it. Everybody had already watched, open-mouthed as the Asuka and Rei, followed along by a strangely exhausted looking Shinji, had come to school that morning, with an identical looking set of Asuka and Rei.  
教室的门缓缓滑开。班上无人需要猜测谁将步入其中。今早，众人已目瞪口呆地看着明日香和绫波，身后跟着一脸疲惫的 Shinji，带着一对与她们如出一辙的明日香和绫波来到学校。

But to the sharp-eyed amongst the students at the school, it was plain as day that something was majorly different about the newest additions to their class.  
但对于那些眼光锐利的同学来说，很明显，新加入班级的这两位有着重大的不同。

"Hello. My name is Rei Ayanami." The red-eyed Rei snorted from her chair as her imposter with the long, cerulean hair attempted an introduction. Narrowing her eyes at the rude interruption, the leaf-eyed Rei continued. "I understand that this situation might well be confusing for everyone, but it is my hope that we can all get along."  
“大家好，我叫绫波零。”红眼绫波从椅子上发出一声嗤笑，而她那位长发蔚蓝的冒牌货试图自我介绍。绿眼绫波眯起眼睛，对这不礼貌的打断表示不满，继续说道：“我明白这情况可能让大家感到困惑，但我希望我们能和睦相处。”

"Understandably, names are likely to get confusing during my time here, so for the moment, you may call me Rei II-..."  
“可以理解，在我在这里的这段时间，名字可能会让人混淆，所以目前，你可以叫我丽二……”

"Are you actually being serious, First Child!? _Rei_ _**II**__?_ HA!"  
“你是在认真说吗，第一适格者！？丽二？哈哈！”

The as-of-yet introduced Asuka clone laughed mirthlessly, an evil sound that chilled the spine of everyone sat down in their chairs. This Asuka was nothing like the one they knew and loved in class. They could feel it from the crazy look in her eyes, the maniacal tone to her spoken words, and her brutish actions that promised a swift and painful retribution to all that crossed her.  
这个尚未正式介绍的明日香克隆人冷笑一声，那邪恶的声音让坐在椅子上的每个人都感到脊背发凉。这个明日香与他们在班级里熟悉并喜爱的那个截然不同。从她疯狂的眼神、狂妄的语调以及预示着对所有冒犯者迅速而痛苦报复的粗暴行为中，他们都能感受到这一点。

The Asuka they had known for so long did have a temper, and a scary one at that.  
他们所熟知的那个明日香确实脾气火爆，而且相当吓人。

But their Asuka had never shown the bloodlust that this crazy version clearly had in her eyes. Apart from the fact that this Asuka had her hair in a ponytail, and was missing the bracelet, everybody in the class would have been able to tell the differences between them, even if they had matching hairstyles and accessories.  
但他们的明日香从未显露出这个疯狂版本眼中明显的嗜血欲望。除了这个明日香把头发扎成了马尾，并且少了那只手镯之外，班上每个人都能看出她们之间的差异，即使她们的发型和配饰一模一样。

"Let me make it **very** clear to you shitheads. **I** am not **her.**" Pointing at her cowering self who was content to lower herself as far as her chair allowed, the crazy Asuka continued, bitter anger injecting into every word.  
“让我跟你们这群混蛋说清楚。我不是她。”疯狂的明日香指着蜷缩在椅子上尽量降低自己存在的自己，继续说道，每个字都充满了苦涩的愤怒。

"I come from a place, a **world**, far away and as close to hell as you can possibly imagine. I've fought messengers of God that threatened to turn everything everybody ever loved into skidmarks on the road. The Tokyo-3 in my world, alongside the world in general, is a fucking ruin, all thanks to a group of old fucktard Illuminati wannabes, a complete and utter dipshit that looks just like **him**-..." She spat the last word out with venom as she pointed at Shinji who was also trying to take cover under the limited defences of his desk. "And his fuckheaded, abhorred, genocidal _arschloch_ of a father!"  
"我来自一个遥远的世界，一个接近地狱边缘的地方。我曾与那些威胁要将所有人所爱的一切化为道路上的污迹的神之使者战斗。我所在世界的东京-3，以及整个世界，都因一群自以为是的旧时代阴谋家，一个彻头彻尾的蠢货——" 她带着毒辣的语气指向试图躲在桌子有限防御下的真嗣，"还有他那令人憎恶、灭绝人性的混账父亲！"她最后那个词几乎是吐出来的。"

Silence was deafening in the class of wide-eyed students. Even Toji, Hikari and Kensuke, who had travelled to the aforementioned hellish Otherworld, were speechless at the pure rage being thrown at them from the redheaded inferno of hate shouting from the front of the classroom.  
教室里一片寂静，学生们瞪大了眼睛。即便是曾经去过那个地狱般异世界的东治、光和健介，也被眼前这位红发怒火中烧的女子从教室前方投来的纯粹愤怒所震撼，无言以对。

"I'm here, because there is no where else for me to go. I'm not here by choice, I don't like any of this, I don't like **any** of you, **ESPECIALLY YOU!**" She screamed once again at the poor boy who was beginning to wish his desk would eat him whole. "And I don't intend to make this easy for any of you. Don't talk to me, don't come near me. I **will** kill you, and fucking **eat** what's left of your remains in front of your loved ones. And if the situation absolutely **demands** that you need to initiate a conversation with me..." Asuka glared at the class as a whole, making sure everyone could see that her eyes were daring them to question her, an evil smile dancing on her face as she felt the inferiority radiate from them.  
"我在这里，因为无处可去。我不是自愿来的，我不喜欢这一切，我不喜欢你们任何人，尤其是你！" 她再次对着那个可怜的男孩尖叫，他开始希望自己的桌子能把他整个吞掉。"我不会让你们任何人好过的。别跟我说话，别靠近我。我会杀了你，然后在你的亲人面前吃掉你剩下的残骸。如果情况绝对需要你来跟我搭话……" 明日香瞪着全班，确保每个人都能看到她的眼神在挑衅他们，质疑她的勇气，她脸上带着邪恶的微笑，感受着他们散发出的自卑感。

"Call me _Crimson_." "叫我深红。"

Rei II, as she so helpfully decided to designate herself, took two slight sidesteps away from the incarnation of the devil herself, wondering if this Asuka had always been so volatile, back when she had a working memory of who she was.  
丽二，她自作主张地这样称呼自己，轻轻地向旁边挪了两步，远离那个恶魔的化身，心里疑惑这个明日香是否一直如此暴躁，在她还有记忆的时候。

"Out of all the names she could have picked, she chose the most agonizingly awkward one of them all?" The Asuka still peeking over her desk in fear whispered with a groan, before her eyes opened wide, just about managing to dodge a chalkboard eraser thrown with enough strength to easily knock her out.  
“在所有可能的名字中，她偏偏选了最让人尴尬到极点的那一个？”躲在桌子后面、仍心有余悸的明日香低声抱怨道，随即她的眼睛瞪得溜圆，险险躲过了一个力道足以将她击晕的黑板擦。

"You wanna say that again, _imposter!?_ Next time I hear any sass, I'll use your pretty little face as **fucking** toilet paper!"  
“你想再说一遍吗，冒牌货！？下次再听到你顶嘴，我就把你那张漂亮的小脸当厕纸用！”

Silence once again drowned the atmosphere, suffocating everyone to the point that nobody could physically move a muscle out of fear. Asuka from the Otherworld, or _Crimson_ as she decided she wanted to be known as, had made it irrevocably clear who ruled the classroom. The pecking order was now firmly established. And to the remainder of the class who hadn't gone to the Otherworld, were truly and utterly convinced, that this girl was an utterly deranged _psychopath_.  
沉默再次笼罩了整个教室，恐惧到让人连动一根手指都做不到。来自异世界的明日香，或者她决定自称的红莲，已经无可置疑地表明了谁是教室的主宰。等级秩序已然确立。而对于那些未曾去过异世界的同学来说，他们彻底相信了这个女孩是个彻头彻尾的疯子。

Misato laughed nervously as the brutal self-introduction drew to a close.  
美里紧张地笑了笑，随着那残酷的自我介绍结束。

"S-so does anybody have any... questions?"  
“那……有人有什么……问题吗？”

The Artificial Research Laboratory had countless rooms used for experiments of various kinds. Rooms for research, development, virtual deification, a command centre in times of crisis and arguably the most important room to one of the prominent scientists in charge, an indoor hot spring.  
人工研究实验室拥有无数用于各种实验的房间。有研究室、开发室、虚拟神化室、危机时的指挥中心，以及对其中一位主要科学家来说可能最重要的房间——室内温泉。

It was in one of the research rooms that Yui and Gendo Ikari, alongside Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu, were sat around a table, armed with a forest's worth of paper strewn about in an unorganized mess, and laptops that connected to various feeds and databases. One of the laptops showed a security camera installed in Shinji's classroom, displaying the aftermath of Crimson's introduction. For some peculiar reason, the one girl who could make even the gods cower in their boots had decided to sit in the desk next to the one boy she had all but declared war on, ejecting the previous occupant by force. For the first time, Yui was glad Mana was sitting on the chair on Shinji's other side. At least she could protect him if Crimson decided she felt like snapping and eating her son alive.  
在一间研究室内，Yui 和 Gendo Ikari 以及 Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu 围坐在一张桌子旁，桌上散落着如森林般密集的纸张，杂乱无章，还有连接着各种数据源和数据库的笔记本电脑。其中一台笔记本显示着安装在真嗣教室内的监控摄像头画面，记录了 Crimson 出现后的情景。出于某种奇特的原因，那个能让众神都胆寒的女孩决定坐在了那个她几乎已宣战过的男孩旁边的座位上，强行驱逐了原主人。这是 Yui 第一次庆幸 Mana 坐在真嗣另一侧的椅子上。至少，如果 Crimson 突然想发飙并吞噬她的儿子，Mana 能保护他。

"So."

The silence that had plagued the room after watching the abrasive transfer student was gently shattered by Kyoko, stretching her arms and clicking her back with a satisfied groan.  
在目睹了那位强势转学生的行为后，房间内笼罩的沉默被 Kyoko 轻轻打破，她伸展双臂，满意地发出一声呻吟，活动着背部。

"What have we learned today?"  
“今天我们学到了什么？”

"My son attracts some weird people..." Gendo grumbled as he continued to watch the feed, just as worried for his son's safety as his wife. His eyes flickered briefly to the blonde doctor who had just sent him a withering glare and an irritated growl.  
"我儿子总是吸引一些奇怪的人..." 碇源堂咕哝着，继续观察着画面，对儿子的安全和妻子一样担忧。他的目光短暂地扫过那位刚刚向他投来严厉目光和不满低吼的金发医生。

"My Asuka is not weird."  
"我的明日香才不奇怪。"

"No, but that one is."  
"不，但那个确实是。"

"Granted, she's a little... _angrier_ than the Asuka I conceived. But she's still Asuka. An Asuka who once had a mother by my name in that world. A mother who she lost at a young age, in an incident that can only be described as horrifying..." Kyoko looked downcast for all but a second, but bounced back almost as fast, smiling radiantly.  
"确实，她比我想象中的明日香要...更愤怒一些。但她依然是明日香。在那个世界里，曾有一个我这样的母亲。一个在她年幼时便不幸失去的母亲，那场事故只能用骇人听闻来形容..." 绫子看起来有些沮丧，但仅仅一瞬，她又迅速恢复了过来，笑容灿烂。

"I want to protect _that_ Asuka, just as much as _my_ Asuka. They're both my little Asuka's."  
"我想保护那个明日香，就像保护我的明日香一样。她们都是我的小明日香。"

Yui smiled at the bubbly scientist. Just where did she get that optimism from? Even with the risk that Crimson might reject her maternal approach to the situation, that still wasn't enough to deter the smiling Kyoko.  
唯对这位乐观的科学家微笑。她的乐观究竟从何而来？即使知道深红可能会拒绝她的母性关怀，这依然不足以阻止笑容满面的绫子。

"It's admirable, without a doubt, but be careful this Asuka doesn't try to kill you."  
"毫无疑问，这很令人钦佩，但小心这个明日香不会试图杀了你。"

"Bah, it'll be fine! One day, they'll be just like sisters!"  
"哼，没事的！总有一天，她们会像亲姐妹一样！"

"I'd be a bit worried if Shinji had a sister who screamed she was going to wipe her arse with his face..." Gendo mumbled warily. Both females in the room glared at him.  
""如果真嗣有个妹妹嚷嚷着要用他的脸擦屁股，我倒是有点担心..."" 源堂谨慎地咕哝道。房间里的两个女性都瞪了他一眼。

"We're trying to have a heartwarming moment here and you're ruining it."  
"我们正试图营造一个温馨的时刻，而你却在破坏它。"

"Sorry Yui..." "对不起，唯..."

Turning her glare away from her husband back to the mountain of research in front of them, Yui groaned as she folded her arms on the table and rested her head on top. Nothing made sense to her anymore. Shinji and his friends had somehow been dragged into a world that could only be described as a parallel universe. After coming back, all of them had been shocked by the three teenagers that had followed them.  
她将怒视从丈夫身上移开，转回面前堆积如山的研究资料，唯叹了口气，双臂交叉放在桌上，头枕在上面。一切都变得难以理解。真嗣和他的朋友们不知怎么被卷入了一个只能称为平行世界的地方。回来后，他们都对跟随他们的三个青少年感到震惊。

One was a literal phantom. Another was perpetually angry and clearly traumatized. And the last was an amnesiac. Three very different versions of the children they knew and loved. And to top it all off, the story of their world, their _pasts_, was almost nothing like the reality they all lived in.  
一个是真正的幽灵。另一个则永远愤怒且明显受到创伤。最后那个则是失忆者。这三个孩子，他们所熟知并深爱的孩子们，如今却是如此迥异。更糟糕的是，他们世界的故事，他们的过去，几乎与他们所生活的现实毫无相似之处。

"A world where 'Angels' came to destroy humanity, and children defended mankind by piloting abominable weapons that were to be used as a catalyst to end the world. I can't even begin to imagine the kinds of horrors those three have been witness to." It was a world Yui wanted no part of.  
“一个世界，‘天使’降临来毁灭人类，而孩子们驾驶着本应用作世界末日催化剂的可憎武器来保卫人类。我甚至无法想象那三个人见证了什么样的恐怖。”这个世界，Yui 一点也不想参与。

But a part of her, deep down, wanted to do something. Anything. Anything that might fix the damage that had occurred in that hell. At the very least, she wanted the three broken children that had dropped in from another world to lead something of a normal life, and maybe even repair _some_ of the damage that had been inflicted on their psyche. But where would they even begin?  
但内心深处，她的一部分想要做些什么。任何事情。任何可能修复那个地狱所造成伤害的事情。至少，她希望那三个从另一个世界掉落的破碎孩子能过上某种正常的生活，甚至可能修复一些对他们心灵造成的伤害。但他们该从哪里开始呢？

Asuka's mother had committed suicide, almost taking her daughter with her. Rei had been a hybrid-Angel who apparently had some of Yui's own DNA in her genetic makeup. Now she was almost stripped of her memories, but may or may not be a wholesome human. And Shinji had been forced to pilot a monster against his will by his own father, a man who sounded nothing like the one who sat next to her. A man who had attempted to orchestrate the near-genocide of mankind for a chance to reunite with the mother who had sold her own soul to a machine and left her son in a cruel, dark world, alone.  
明日香的母亲自杀了，几乎把女儿也带走了。绫波曾是混合型使徒，显然她的基因里含有一些碇唯的 DNA。如今她的记忆几乎被抹去，但或许仍是一个纯洁的人类。而真嗣被迫违背自己的意愿驾驶着怪物，他的父亲，一个听起来与坐在她旁边的人截然不同的男人，曾试图策划几乎灭绝人类的行动，只为有机会与那个卖掉自己灵魂给机器、将儿子留在残酷黑暗世界中的母亲重聚。

Not to mention Shinji was technically dead. A problem that would normally be impossible to solve. Yui wouldn't have even thought it possible the power of the bracelets would be able to resurrect the dead.  
更不用说真嗣在技术上已经死了。这是一个通常无法解决的问题。碇唯甚至不会想到手环的力量能够复活死者。

Yet, when the group came back from their field trip, her son and friends had explained how the bracelets had resurrected the Otherworld's Asuka and Rei, from skeletons no less. Reviving the phantom Shinji might be possible, but something was keeping the frustrated scientist wary of the spectre that resembled her son. An aura that told her in a little voice that, even though he was technically the same little boy as the one she had given birth too, something was off.  
然而，当这群孩子从实地考察回来后，她的儿子和朋友们讲述了那些手环是如何让异世界的明日香和丽从骸骨中复活的。复活幽灵真嗣或许有可能，但某种东西让这位沮丧的科学家对那个酷似她儿子的幽灵保持警惕。一种气息告诉她，尽管从技术上讲，他和她所生的那个小男孩是同一个人，但有些不对劲。

_He could not be trusted.  
他不可信任。_

Lunch had come to the whispering classroom. Normally that entailed a cacophony of students moving about, giggles and conversations about god only knew what, and the smells of various home-cooked or cafeteria-appropriated meals.  
午餐时间悄然而至，教室里低语声此起彼伏。通常这意味着学生们四处走动，笑声和关于天知道什么的交谈，以及各种自制或食堂特色餐点的香味。

Today, the classroom was a graveyard, save for eight people. The majority of the class had decided a tactical retreat was in order to escape the stifling atmosphere of the class, leaving the infamous students a whole class to themselves.  
今天，教室宛如一片墓地，除了八个人外空无一人。大多数同学为了逃避班级里令人窒息的氛围，选择了战术性撤退，留下那些臭名昭著的学生独享整个教室。

Whilst Kensuke, Toji and Hikari were talking to, or rather, trying to mediate a heated discussion between the two Rei's, Shinji, Asuka and Mana were eating their food peacefully.  
与此同时， Kensuke、Toji 和 Hikari 正在与，或者更确切地说，试图调解两位 Rei 之间的激烈争论，而 Shinji、Asuka 和 Mana 则安静地享用着他们的食物。

Or as peacefully as it could be next to the girl who had threatened classroom genocide only a few hours beforehand.  
或者说，在几个小时前扬言要进行教室大屠杀的女孩旁边，这已经算是相当平静的了。

Perceptive to his new neighbour, Shinji had quickly realized that she wasn't eating anything. Partly because she had all but refused his offer of a bento box in the morning. Various sounds of hunger were making themselves known coming from the angry, or angrier version of Asuka, which seemed to only fuel her bitter expression as she glared at seemingly nothing in front of her.  
对于新邻居的敏锐观察，真嗣很快就意识到她什么都没吃。部分原因是她几乎拒绝了早上他递给她的便当盒。各种饥饿的声音从愤怒或更愤怒的明日香那里传来，这似乎只是加剧了她对眼前看似无物怒目而视的苦涩表情。

"Here." Shinji took the lunch he had brought to school anyway, and placed it in front of the stewing teenager, hoping to any of the gods advocating peace in the world that she wouldn't take the thing and throw it in his eyes.  
“给。”真嗣把他带到学校的午餐放在了闷闷不乐的少女面前，希望世界上任何一位倡导和平的神明能保佑她不会拿起那东西扔进他的眼睛。

"I told you I didn't need it." He had been expecting a shout, but Crimson spoke in a low voice that didn't seem as angry as it had before. Sighing, he fished a spare set of chopsticks out of a case he kept in his bag, and placed them in front of her.  
“我说过我不需要。”他本以为会听到一声大喊，但明日香用一种比之前不那么愤怒的低沉声音说道。叹了口气，他从书包里的小盒子里拿出一套备用的筷子，放在她面前。

"Just... look. I can hear your stomach grumbling, and when was the last time you actually ate solid food? You've technically been dead for a while, eat this and you'll feel right as rain."  
"就... 看看。我能听到你的肚子在咕咕叫，你上次吃固体食物是什么时候？你理论上已经死了好一阵子了，吃点这个，你会感觉好得像雨后的彩虹。"

Doubting that his food actually had the stuffing to live up to his claims, Crimson took the bento box anyway, looking away from him.  
尽管怀疑他的食物是否真有他说的那么神奇，Crimson 还是接过了便当盒，目光从他身上移开。

"Whatever. If it shuts you up for five minutes, I'll eat your stupid food. Free food always tastes the best after all." Her face was tinged red. It didn't matter what universe they were in, some things really didn't change. And at least this version Shinji hadn't tried to destroy the world...  
"随便吧。如果这能让你安静五分钟，我就吃你这愚蠢的食物。毕竟，免费的食物总是最美味。" 她的脸微微泛红。无论在哪个宇宙，有些事情真的不会改变。而且至少这个版本的 Shinji 没有试图毁灭世界...

Shaking her head before any embarrassing thoughts came to mind, she put a mouthful of the fried chicken and rice into her mouth.  
她摇了摇头，赶在任何尴尬的念头浮现之前，将一口炸鸡和米饭送入口中。

She had forgotten how good his food actually tasted. True to his words, it _**had**_ been a long time since she'd eaten anything solid. And his cooking was even better than the Shinji's she had shared a world with.  
她忘记了他的食物实际上有多美味。正如他所说，她已经很久没有吃过任何固体食物了。而且他的厨艺甚至比她曾共处的那个世界的真嗣还要好。

_"Probably because this Shinji isn't crippled with any of the destabilizing issues he had."_ Crimson thought to herself, not realizing she was devouring the food like a wild animal. Heck, even an animal would have _some_ grace, compared to how Crimson was massacring her meal.  
“可能是因为这个真嗣没有受到那些不稳定问题的影响。”绯红心想，却没有意识到自己正像野兽一样狼吞虎咽。天哪，即使是动物也比绯红这般狼藉的吃相要优雅些。

They say that food will always taste the best when you think of the person who's going to be eating it whilst it's been prepared. All of her favorites were in this box, and it all tasted incredible. Had Shinji been thinking of her when he made this lunch?  
人们常说，当你在准备食物时想着将要享用它的那个人，食物的味道会格外美味。这个盒子里装满了她最喜欢的菜肴，每一口都令人难以置信。难道真嗣在做这顿午餐时想到了她吗？

No. There was no way. It was identical to her _imposter's_ bento anyhow. Two reflections of the same person were going to enjoy the same meal. It just made sense.  
不，不可能。反正这便当和她冒牌货的那份一模一样。两个同一个人的映像将享用同样的餐食，这很合理。

But if it tasted this good, what did that mean? Did the Shinji of this world like the Asuka who was here before she arrived?  
但如果这味道如此美妙，那意味着什么呢？难道这个世界的真嗣喜欢她，那个在她到来之前的明日香？

Something inside her was gnawing away at her emotions. A whirlpool of mixed feelings filled her mind to the brim. Anger, loneliness, regret, confusion, jealousy. And for some strange reason, she really felt like she wanted to cry.  
某种东西在她内心啃噬着她的情感。一团混杂的情绪漩涡将她的思绪填得满满当当。愤怒、孤独、悔恨、困惑、嫉妒。出于某种奇怪的原因，她真的觉得自己很想哭。

After finishing whatever was left of the meal, Crimson put the box down on the desk, a little harder then she intended, causing everyone to jump.  
吃完剩下的饭菜后，Crimson 将盒子重重地放在桌子上，比她预想的要用力一些，让所有人都吓了一跳。

"W-was it good, Asu-...Crimson?"  
“好吃吗，Asu-...Crimson？”

"Thanks for the meal." The girl's eyes were covered by her bangs, as she stood up and walked out of the classroom. It was faint, but sitting right next to her, Shinji caught a glimpse of her expression.  
"谢谢你的餐点。" 女孩的眼睛被刘海遮住，她站起身，走出了教室。虽然微弱，但坐在她旁边的真嗣还是捕捉到了她的表情。

Why did she suddenly look so upset?  
她为什么突然显得这么难过？

"Did she just _thank_ you!?" Toji said incredulously. "Not even _our_ Asuka remembers to do that!"  
"她刚刚是向你道谢了吗！？" 冬二难以置信地说道。"就连我们的明日香也不记得这么做！"

A yelp of pain indicated that the boy was hit hard from both the girl in question and the class president.  
一声痛苦的叫喊表明那个男孩不仅被当事女孩狠狠击中，还遭到了班长的重击。

"Can you learn to ever just read the mood? Just this once, keep that big mouth shut!" Hikari glared at him as she spoke. She was distracted by Shinji suddenly standing up, looking at the door where Crimson had hastily departed, looking worried.  
“你就不能学会看场合吗？就这一次，闭上你那张大嘴！”光瞪着他，边说边分心看着真嗣突然站起来，望向绯红匆忙离去的门口，面露忧色。

"Go after her Shinji." “去追她，真嗣。”

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

The redheaded girl was also looking at the door. She looked melancholic, and thoughtful at the same time.  
红发女孩也正望着门口。她的神情既忧郁又若有所思。

"If that was me, I'd want you to come after me. And considering she basically _**is**_ me, I'm sure she can't be alone right now." With a nod, Shinji ran out of the classroom. The others turned to look at Asuka, confused.  
"如果那是我，我会希望你追上来。既然她基本上就是我，我相信她现在肯定不想一个人。" 点了点头，真嗣跑出了教室。其他人则困惑地转向明日香。

"What's going on Asuka?" "怎么了，明日香？"

Ignoring Hikari's question completely, she continued to finish her lunch. Holding up a bit of her fried chicken, she looked at it for a second, as though the meat could answer all the strange questions in her mind. Popping it into her mouth, she chewed, a slightly lonely smile displaying on her lips.  
完全无视了光的问题，她继续吃着午餐。举起一块炸鸡，她盯着它看了一会儿，仿佛这块肉能解答她心中所有的奇怪疑问。将炸鸡放入口中咀嚼，她的嘴角露出一丝略显孤独的微笑。

"His chicken _is_ good." "他的炸鸡很好吃。"

---

It had taken Shinji little time to find the wildcard student. As if following what he knew was cliché, he immediately went straight to the roof of the school. Where else would a person who wanted to be alone want to be?  
真嗣没花多少时间就找到了那位特立独行的学生。仿佛遵循着他所知的陈词滥调，他直接去了学校的屋顶。一个想要独处的人还能去哪儿呢？

Somewhere they could see the sky. As if the heavens above could give you the answers you wanted.  
某个能看到天空的地方。仿佛天上的苍穹能给你想要的答案。

He knew because he'd been playing by the same rulebook not that long ago. Back when the Asuka from his world had been less than friendly towards him. Back in a time he'd rather not remember.  
他知道这一点，因为他不久前也遵循着同样的规则。那时，他所在世界的明日香对他并不友好。那是一段他宁愿忘记的时光。

Putting aside his nostalgia at how little had changed since he had last been whiling away his time up here, he spotted the objective, sitting on one of the decrepit benches lying in the middle of the area.  
他暂时放下对这里几乎未变的怀旧之情，目光落在了目标上，那人正坐在场地中央一张破旧的长椅上。

She was sitting with her arms wrapped around her legs, silently glaring at a spot on the floor around her. It reminded him of how the Asuka he had grown up with used to act. Unsociable, seemingly uncaring, but in reality...  
她双臂环抱着双腿，静静地瞪着脚边的一块地板。这让他想起了小时候的明日香，总是显得孤僻、漠不关心，但实际上……

She just looked lonely. 她看起来只是很孤单。

"I can say for certain..." The girl he'd thought hadn't noticed his presence suddenly spoke up. "That you're definitely not the same Shinji Ikari that I know."  
"我可以肯定地说..." 他原以为没注意到他的女孩突然开口了。"你绝对不是我所认识的那个碇真嗣。"

"What makes you say that?"  
"你为什么这么说？"

Crimson Asuka didn't even look at him. She continued to look at the ground angrily, as though if she glared at it for long enough, she could melt a hole into it.  
赤红的明日香甚至没有看他一眼。她继续愤怒地盯着地面，仿佛如果她瞪得够久，就能在上面融化出一个洞来。

"At least he had some semblance of respect for privacy."  
“至少他对隐私还有些许尊重。”

Her words threw Shinji for a second. On the surface, she was accusing him of invading her space, and that she wanted nothing more than to be left alone.  
她的言辞让真嗣愣了一下。表面上，她是在指责他侵犯了她的空间，她只希望独自一人。

But he knew better than that. He knew better then to trust words, laced with everything but the truth. He'd had plenty of practice with a certain someone else, at least when it came to looking underneath the underneath.  
但他深知不能仅凭表面。他知道不能轻信那些充满谎言的言辞。至少在洞察真相这方面，他已从某人身上积累了足够的经验。

Against his better judgement, he slowly walked over to the bench, and sat down next to her. Close enough that he didn't show his poorly concealed fear, but far enough to not be touching her.  
尽管心中有所顾虑，他还是缓缓走向长椅，坐到了她的旁边。近到不显露他那隐秘的恐惧，又远到不触及她。

"What are you doing?" Her question was once again in a low voice. But this time it was laced with an actual warning. Shinji braced himself as he spoke again.  
“你在做什么？”她的声音再次低沉，但这次却带着明显的警告意味。真嗣做好准备，再次开口。

"Not running away." “没有逃跑。”

Getting punched in the face, really, _**really**_ hurts. Getting punched by the girl who looked just like another girl who used to punch you in the face all the time, somehow hurt less than he had expected it to.  
被一拳打在脸上，真的，真的很痛。被一个长得像另一个经常打你脸的女孩的女孩打，不知怎么的，比他预期的要轻一些。

"THE _**FUCK**_ IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!?" Crimson Asuka was livid. He could clearly see the rage of fire in her eyes, and for a split second, he thought he had said something he shouldn't have. But it was gone in the second it took to pick himself up from the floor, where the punch had unceremoniously thrown him. Rubbing his now achingly sore cheek, Shinji chuckled, serving to infuriate the girl even more.  
"这他妈是什么意思！？" 绯红明日香怒不可遏。他可以清楚地看到她眼中的怒火，有那么一瞬间，他以为自己说了不该说的话。但就在他从被那一拳无情击倒的地板上站起来的那一刻，这种感觉消失了。揉着现在酸痛不已的脸颊，真嗣轻笑了一声，这让女孩更加愤怒。

"Is that it?" "就这？"

Shinji suddenly found himself hoist in the air, the breath being squeezed out of him as the girl he had just taunted lifted him by his shirt, her eyes promising him death.  
真嗣突然发现自己被举到了空中，呼吸被紧紧挤压出来，那个他刚刚嘲弄的女孩用她的眼睛向他承诺死亡，将他揪着衬衫提了起来。

"I'll enjoy snapping your neck, shit-for-brains." A second after her words had dissipated into the noontime heat, Shinji felt his world turn upside down as Crimson Asuka threw him to the ground, straddling him. A right hook connected with his intact cheek, blackening his vision. More punches came. His nose cracked horribly. Blood exploded from his nostrils as the girl kept pounding into him. His face was likely going to look like a mass of bruises and blood later, but he let the girl continue until it seemed she'd had her fill. Letting her blood-drenched fists rest, she looked down her nose at him, cold ruthlessness filling her eyes.  
"我会很享受扭断你脖子的，脑残。"她的话音在正午的热浪中消散后不久，真嗣感到自己的世界天旋地转，赤红明日香将他摔在地上，跨坐在他身上。一记右勾拳击中了他完好的脸颊，让他的视线变得模糊。更多的拳头接踵而至。他的鼻子可怕地断裂了。鲜血从他的鼻孔中喷涌而出，女孩不停地殴打他。他的脸可能晚些时候会变成一片瘀伤和血迹，但他任由女孩继续，直到她似乎打够了。让她沾满血的拳头停下来，她俯视着他，眼中充满了冰冷的残忍。

"That enough for you, or do you feel like some broken limbs too?"  
"这对你来说够了吗，还是你也想体验一下断肢的滋味？"

A chuckle filled the air. It was actually more of a bloody snort as Shinji started laughing on the ground. The laughing lasted until his throat decided it needed to clear some blood out of his airways. Spots of the crimson liquid found a home on the wide-eyed Asuka's face. Why in god's name was he _**laughing**_?  
一阵轻笑声在空气中弥漫开来。实际上，这更像是一种血腥的鼻息，因为真嗣躺在地上开始大笑。笑声一直持续到他的喉咙决定需要清理一下呼吸道中的血液。几滴鲜红的液体落在了睁大眼睛的明日香脸上。天哪，他到底在笑什么？

"And cue-..." “然后就——”

"And what?-ooph!" Asuka bent over double, her mind shocked as her abdomen felt a strong punch connect, briefly winding her. In her moment of weakness, Shinji pushed the winded girl off him, pinning her down by her shoulders.  
“然后什么？——哎哟！”明日香弯腰成弓形，她的思维被腹部感受到的一记重拳震惊了，这短暂地让她喘不过气来。在她虚弱的瞬间，真嗣将她推开，用肩膀将她按倒在地。

"You... pathetic...urrf..." Crimson coughed as she tried to wheeze some air back into her lungs. "What kind of lowlife scum... *cough* hits a girl..."  
"你...可悲的...呃..." Crimson 一边咳嗽一边试图将空气吸入肺部。"什么样的下流渣滓...*咳嗽*打一个女孩..."

"I should tell you. I'm a man who believes in true gender equality. I've got no problems dropkicking a girl if the situation calls for it-... GEEEH!" Shinji's quote was interrupted when the palm of Asuka's fist hit his already battered nose, throwing him off the seething female. Rolling just in time to avoid being stomped, Shinji scrambled to his feet, putting up a guard as he grinned at his opponent.  
"我应该告诉你。我是一个坚信真正性别平等的男人。如果情况需要，我毫不介意给一个女孩来个飞踢-...哎哟！" Shinji 的话被 Asuka 的拳头打断，拳头击中了他已经受伤的鼻子，将他击退。他及时翻滚避开踩踏，迅速起身，摆出防御姿势，对着对手咧嘴一笑。"

"Lowlife scum like you are the type of men I utterly despise. Who the hell would punch a girl like that!? I'M GONNA TEAR YOUR FUCKING EYES OUT!"  
"像你这样的下流渣滓是我最鄙视的男人。谁会那样打一个女孩！？我要挖出你的狗眼！"

A dodged punch from her, a narrowly missed uppercut from him, a graze on her face, a claw-mark on his face. Both teenagers traded blows, not giving any quarter to their opponent. The fight landed back on the ground once again, with both of them rolling around, trying to find an opening.  
她躲过一拳，他险些被上勾拳击中，她脸上擦伤，他脸上留下爪痕。两个少年互不相让，拳拳到肉。战斗再次回到地面，两人滚作一团，试图找到对方的破绽。

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT, THIRD CHILD!?"  
“你他妈到底想要什么，三子？！”

"I don't know anyone with a stupid name like 'Third Child'!" Asuka screamed in response, trying to bite his neck whilst Shinji tried hard to keep her at arm's length, his bracelet dangling violently. At some point, she succeeded in biting his arm, eventually drawing blood. Shinji screamed in pain, but somehow also managed to keep a weird smile on his face, even managing to choke out a laugh.  
“我可不认识什么叫‘三子’这种蠢名字的人！”明日香尖叫着回应，试图咬住他的脖子，而真嗣拼命用手臂挡住她，手镯剧烈摇晃。最终，她成功咬住了他的手臂，鲜血随之流出。真嗣痛苦地尖叫，却不知为何脸上还挂着奇怪的笑容，甚至勉强笑出声来。

"STOP LAUGHING AT ME!" Crimson Asuka screamed through his flesh, muffling her words.  
“别笑我！”绯红明日香透过他的血肉尖叫，声音变得沉闷。

"I can't. Not even _she_ ever actually bit me before!"  
“我忍不住。她以前从没真的咬过我！”

The fighting suddenly stopped. Crimson Asuka's mouth was still wrapped onto Shinji's arm, her teeth looking all but animalistic, but she wasn't physically biting down anymore.  
战斗突然停止了。绯红明日香的嘴仍紧贴着真嗣的手臂，她的牙齿显得异常野蛮，但她已经不再用力咬下去了。

"She?" Muffled words again. This time accompanied by a curious look.  
"她？" 又是一阵含糊的话语，这次还伴随着好奇的目光。

"Asuka, the other Asuka I mean... we used to get into fights like this all the time."  
"明日香，我是说另一个明日香……我们以前经常这样打架。"

It was a strange feeling. He was explaining himself to a girl who's teeth were still firmly lodged into his forearm. But he continued regardless. He was used to strange occurrences in his daily life by now.  
这是一种奇怪的感觉。他在向一个牙齿还紧紧咬在他前臂上的女孩解释自己。但他还是继续说了下去。他现在已经习惯了日常生活中发生的奇怪事情。

"She was a lot like you are now. Never was a people person. Used to get angry at the touch of a hat. And she used to take great pleasure in taking out her frustrations on me. It wasn't the happiest of times for either of us."  
"她和你现在很像。从来不是个合群的人。稍微碰一下就会生气。而且她常常把对我的不满发泄出来，那对我们俩都不是什么愉快的时光。"

"Our parents work at the Artificial Research Laboratory. Both Asuka's mother and my parents. More often than not, this meant we barely ever got to see them. There was a time Asuka didn't see her mother for a whole year. And to an eight year old, that didn't do much good to her."  
"我们的父母在人工研究实验室工作。明日香的母亲和我的父母都是。这通常意味着我们很少能见到他们。有一次，明日香整整一年都没见到她妈妈。对于一个八岁的孩子来说，这并没有给她带来多少好处。"

At some point without realizing it, Crimson Asuka had let go of Shinji's arm, a trickle of blood dribbling down her lip. But she just sat there, listening to him.  
不知不觉中，绯红明日香已经放开了真嗣的手臂，一丝血迹从她的唇边滑落。但她只是坐在那里，静静地听着他。

"She used to get angry, a lot. A few times her mother had to apologize to my parents when I'd turn up looking like I'd been put through a blender. There was a time Asuka had to be kept away from me, for my own safety."  
"她以前经常生气，非常多。有几次她妈妈不得不向我父母道歉，因为我看起来像是被扔进了搅拌机。有一次，为了我的安全，不得不让明日香远离我。"

"But I always knew. I knew she wasn't hitting me, or hurting me because she hated me. She just wanted to vent, she wanted to let the world know she was angry, and hurt, and alone. Alone except for one friend." Shinji cracked out another smile. "Me."  
"但我一直都知道。我知道她打我，或者伤害我，并不是因为她恨我。她只是想发泄，她想让世界知道她很愤怒，很受伤，很孤独。除了一个朋友，她很孤独。" 真嗣又露出了一个微笑。"我。"

"I know you're not the same as her. You come from a world far more broken, from a past that's scarier than any horror movie I've ever seen. There's just no comparing the two, with what little I know about you and the others. But..." Shinji lightly nudged her shoulder with a fist. "Instead of bottling it all up, if you ever need to vent, come see me. A few scrapes and bruises are nothing this little thing can't fix."  
"我知道你和她不一样。你来自一个更加破碎的世界，来自一个比我看过的任何恐怖电影都更可怕的过去。仅凭我对你的了解和其他人的情况，两者之间几乎无法比较。但是..." 真嗣轻轻地用拳头碰了碰她的肩膀。"与其把一切都憋在心里，如果你需要发泄，来找我。几处擦伤和瘀伤，这个小东西都能搞定。"

At his words, his bracelet lit up. Both of their injuries started to glow with an odd, eerie, but somehow warm and comforting green light, before fading away, taking the pain with them. Standing up, he offered her his hand.  
他的话音刚落，手镯便亮了起来。两人的伤口开始散发出一种奇异、阴森却又莫名温暖和安慰的绿光，随后渐渐消失，连同疼痛一起带走。他站起身，向她伸出手。

"I'm sorry for hitting you. I wasn't doing it with malicious intent."  
“对不起，我打了你。我并非恶意为之。”

Crimson stared at the hand for a moment, before laughing. A true laugh, without any of the mirth, ruthlessness or hate she had displayed before. Taking the hand, she stood up and turned around, hiding her face from him.  
绯红盯着那只手片刻，随即笑了起来。这是发自内心的笑声，没有之前展现出的任何欢乐、无情或仇恨。她握住他的手，站起身，转过头去，不让他看到她的脸。

"You're... really weird. Like, super masochistic kind of weird."  
"你真是...太奇怪了。简直是个超级受虐狂那种奇怪。"

"I've heard. Mainly from the two male idiots I call friends."  
"我听说过。主要来自我那两个称之为朋友的蠢货。"

"But even so. This wasn't a... bad little chat."  
"尽管如此。这次聊天倒也不...坏。"

_"She calls that a 'chat'?"_ Shinji thought grimly to himself as he watched her walk away. She stopped as she reached the door to the roof.  
"她管那叫'聊天'？" 真嗣阴沉地想着，看着她走开。当她走到通往屋顶的门前时，她停了下来。

"Oh, and one more thing." She turned to face him, smiling. A smile that mirrored the warm smiles he had seen the other Asuka displaying lately.  
"哦，还有一件事。" 她转过身来面对他，微笑着。这个微笑与他最近看到的另一个明日香所展现的温暖笑容如出一辙。

"Shinji, you taste pretty good. I think I'll take you up on more of our little chats in the future..." She winked as she walked through the door lading down from the roof.  
"真嗣，你味道不错。我想我会接受我们未来更多的这种小聊天的..." 她眨了眨眼，穿过通往屋顶的门离开了。

Shinji, for his part, was wondering what kind of monster he had managed to unleash on himself once again. He was going to have to cover his whole body in fish oil at some point.  
对于自己的所作所为，真嗣不禁疑惑自己究竟又释放了什么样的怪物。他可能得在某一刻全身涂满鱼油。

### Chapter 16: Inferno
第十六章：炼狱  

He hadn't been ready. 他还没准备好。

The plan to calm down Crimson had gone well. A little _too_ well. He thought that after letting loose and venting her frustrations, Crimson might be a _little_ more interactive and less hostile towards them all.  
安抚绯红情绪的计划进行得很顺利。有点太顺利了。他原以为，在发泄完怒火和不满之后，绯红可能会变得更加互动，对他们的敌意也会减少一些。

But it was not to be.  
但事与愿违。

_Beep Beep Beep Beep 哔哔哔哔_

His alarm was ringing. He wanted to turn it off. Most other days, all he had to do was reach over and tap the snooze button. But today, he was having some difficulty doing anything like that.  
他的闹钟响了。他想关掉它。大多数日子里，他只需伸手按下暂停键即可。但今天，他做任何类似的事情都有些困难。

"Okay Shinji, lets actually use that brain for once and figure this out on our own." Shinji gritted his teeth as he tried to loosen his arms, which were currently tied to something at the top of his bed. He dared not look at _what_ was tying his hands up, as it felt soft and cottony, with a slight sense of elasticity. He knew damn well what that was without even looking at it. He knew exactly who they belonged to as well.  
“好了，真嗣，这次我们真的要用用脑子，自己解决这个问题。” 真嗣咬紧牙关，试图松开被绑在床头的手臂。他不敢看是什么东西绑住了他的手，因为它感觉柔软而有弹性，像是棉质的。他心里清楚那是什么，即使不看不也知道。他也清楚它们属于谁。  
The culprit to this dastardly scheme was currently snoozing on top of him. A familiar view of orange hair was obscuring most of his vision and he could feel the chest of the girl respirating on top of him.  
这场恶作剧的始作俑者此刻正躺在他身上打盹。一抹熟悉的橙色头发遮挡了他的大部分视线，他能感觉到女孩的胸膛在他身上起伏。

Said girl sleepily reached over, picked up the alarm clock with a smile and threw it violently against the wall. This wasn't the first time the clock had met such a demise. It seemed to be every other day it was seemingly destroyed, only to be put back together again by the bracelets. Normally by Asuka as a way of apologizing for breaking it in the first place.  
那女孩睡眼惺忪地伸手拿起闹钟，笑着用力扔向墙壁。这已经不是闹钟第一次遭遇这样的命运了。似乎每隔一天它就会被毁掉，然后又被手环重新组装起来。通常是明日香为了道歉而修复它，毕竟一开始就是她弄坏的。

The offending girl today wasn't Asuka though. Even though she felt like Asuka, looked like Asuka and smelled like Asuka, the girl currently lying on top of him, returning to a comfortable position after ending the life of an innocent timekeeping device, was none other than the same girl that was biting his arm the day before, after beating the literal crap out of him.  
今天惹事的女孩并非明日香。尽管她感觉像明日香，看起来像明日香，闻起来也像明日香，但此刻躺在他身上，结束了一个无辜计时设备的生命后回到舒适位置的女孩，正是昨天咬他手臂的那位，之前还把他打得半死。

_Why in God's name was Crimson in his bed!?  
天哪，为什么克莱姆森会在他的床上！？_

_Why was she lying on top of him!?  
她为什么躺在他身上！？_

_Where in God's name was her shirt!?  
她的衬衫到底在哪儿！？_

These and similar questions were currently racing through his mind, one of which was wondering why he was also topless, but a thought suddenly occurred.  
这些问题以及类似的疑问此刻正飞速掠过他的脑海，其中之一便是好奇自己为何也赤裸上身，但突然间一个念头闪现。  
If he was the type of unfortunate soul to encounter misfortune no matter what, he was expecting Asuka to slam open his door any second now and-  
如果他是不幸之人，无论做什么都会遭遇不幸，那么他预计明日香随时会猛地推开他的门，然后——

"**CRIMSON!**" "深红！"

_Yup, here we go. 没错，我们开始了。_

"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SLEEPING IN MY ROOM!"  
"你应该在我的房间里睡觉的！"

"You don't taste as good as Shinji though."  
"你可没有真嗣那么好吃。"

"Oh my god, WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN!?"  
"我的天，这他妈是什么意思！？"

He couldn't tell if Crimson was insinuating what he thought she was just to drive Asuka crazy or that she had actually gone and bitten Asuka in her sleep.  
他无法确定深红是在暗示她所想的那样，只是为了把明日香逼疯，还是她真的在明日香睡着时咬了她一口。  
Honestly, he sure as hell didn't really care for the answer. He just wanted to wake up to a peaceful morning for once. Was that too much to ask?  
说实话，他真的不在乎答案。他只是想有一次能醒来时迎来一个平静的早晨。这要求过分吗？

"I thought you hated him!?"  
"我以为你讨厌他！？"

"I hate the ghost." Crimson was referring to Shinji's doppelganger who had been haunting their residence for the past few days. God only knew where he was right now though. Asuka was fuming as she took in the sight of the two teenagers lying on top of each other, topless. Crimson was smirking, directing her taunt to her lookalike that was all but ready to detonate.  
"我讨厌那个幽灵。" 克里姆指的是真嗣的替身，那个在过去几天一直困扰着他们住所的幽灵。只有上帝知道他现在在哪里。明日香气得满脸通红，看着两个赤裸上身的少年躺在彼此身上。克里姆冷笑着，向那个几乎要爆发的她的替身挑衅道。

"You… You need to get off him!"  
"你…你得从他身上下来！"

"I'll be sure to get him off alright."  
"我会让他好好下来的。"

"THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID, SKANK! GET. OFF. HIM!"  
"我不是那个意思，贱人！下！来！"

"Why don't you make me?"  
"你为什么不试试让我呢？"

"_Because you scare the crap out of me, you shameless psychopath!"_ Asuka gritted her teeth as she tried to think of a way to vocalise that without getting her face shoved into a toilet.  
"因为你这个无耻的精神病让我吓得要死！" 明日香咬紧牙关，试图想出一个不会被对方把脸按进马桶里的表达方式。

"If I may have an opinion…"  
"如果我可以发表意见的话…"

"No Shinji. You need to shut up and let the girls talk."  
"不行，真嗣。你得闭嘴，让女孩们说话。"

"Sure, why not, let's all be late for school, that'll be even more fun." Shinji closed his eyes again, resigning himself to his fate as Crimson turned back to Asuka.  
""当然，为什么不呢，让我们都迟到去上学，那会更有趣。"" 真嗣再次闭上眼睛，无奈地接受了自己的命运，克里姆则转回对明日香说。

"You can either accept that this is going to be a thing from now on or we are going to have a lot of problems."  
"你要么接受从现在开始这将成为常态，要么我们会有很多麻烦。"

"You're supposed to be me right?" Asuka said through gritted teeth.  
"你应该就是我吧？" 明日香咬牙切齿地说道。

"Apparently. A slightly more educated version maybe."  
"显然如此。或许是个稍微受过教育的版本。"

"Then you already know my answer." Asuka put her bracelet arm out, showing the two residing in the bed her palm, a small ball of crackling energy charging in front of it, her face contorted with rage.  
"那么你已经知道我的答案了。" 明日香伸出戴着手镯的手臂，向床上两人展示她的手掌，掌前凝聚着一团噼啪作响的能量，她的脸上满是愤怒。

In the blink of an eye, Shinji had jumped out of the bed, placed his palm on the raging girl's own, cancelling out the magical science.  
转眼间，真嗣已经从床上跳下，将手掌放在狂怒的女孩手上，抵消了那股魔法科技的力量。

"Shinji, what the hell!?"  
“真嗣，搞什么鬼！？”

"Can we _please_ not blow up my room _again_?"  
“我们能不能不要再炸我的房间了？”

"Ha, you tell her Shin-" Before she could finish, Shinji placed a finger on his free hand on Crimson's lips.  
"哈，你告诉她，真-" 她话音未落，真嗣用空着的手指轻轻按在绯红的双唇上。

"...and that's enough out of you. I get that you two don't have to be nice to each other, but can we at least avoid having a fight all the time?" His eyes held a steely glow as his gaze jumped between the two of them.  
"……够了。我明白你们俩不必相互友善，但至少能避免总是争吵吗？" 他的目光中闪烁着坚定的光芒，在两人之间来回扫视。

"I care for you both and I don't want anybody to get hurt."  
"我关心你们两个，不希望任何人受到伤害。"

A strange, awkward silence fell over the room before Shinji turned bright red, quickly removing his hands.  
房间里突然陷入一种奇怪而尴尬的沉默，随后真嗣的脸变得通红，迅速移开了双手。

"Please don't kill me." “请不要杀我。”

Both girls looked at each other nervously, both tinged with a blush.  
两个女孩紧张地对视着，脸上都泛起了红晕。

"I… uh…" Asuka gulped before turning to the door. "...need to finish my toast." She quickly departed.  
"我…呃…" 明日香咽了咽口水，转向门口。"...我得把我的吐司吃完。" 她迅速离开了。

"I should probably find my shirt…" Crimson was next to beat a hasty retreat. Suddenly Shinji was alone in his room, confused.  
"我应该去找找我的衬衫…" 绛红紧随其后，匆忙撤退。突然间，真嗣的房间里只剩下他一个人，感到困惑。

"...am I not dead?" "...我难道没死吗？"

Before he could formulate an answer to his rhetorical question, Misato's head poked around the door, looking just as confused as he felt.  
在他能对他的反问做出回答之前，美里探头从门边望进来，看起来和他一样困惑。

"Why did both Asuka's come out of your room? And why was one of them topless?" All he could do was look at her, looking completely lost.  
“为什么两个明日香都从你房间里出来了？而且其中一个还光着上身？”他只能看着她，完全不知所措。

"I… don't know?" “我……不知道？”

Somehow, everyone managed to leave the house on time. The awkward silence from earlier hadn't yet dissipated, meaning Shinji was cramped between the two girls on a busy train with nobody making eye contact. It was almost a relief when they made it to school and he could rest his head on his school desk.  
不知怎么的，大家都准时离开了家。早先的尴尬沉默还未消散，这意味着真嗣挤在拥挤的火车上，夹在两个女孩之间，却没有人对视。当他们到达学校，他可以把头靠在课桌上时，几乎感到一种解脱。

"The days just started, why do you look like hell?" Kensuke had apparated by his desk, looking concerned.  
“日子才刚开始，你怎么看起来像地狱一样？”健介突然出现在他的课桌旁，面露关切。

"How do you unawkward something Ken?" Shinji mumbled into the wood he was resting on.  
“健，你怎么让尴尬消失呢？”真嗣喃喃地对着他靠着的木头说。

"What did you do?" "你做了什么？"

"I wish I knew…" "我要是知道就好了…"

"Very helpful Shinji." "真有帮助啊，真嗣。"

The classroom door opened, with the regular and nuclear Asuka's walking in together, along with a Misato that looked as exhausted as Shinji felt. The two students wandered over to their respective desks as their homeroom teacher made a feeble attempt to address the class.  
教室的门打开了，规律与核心的明日香一同走进来，还有看起来和真嗣一样疲惫的美里。两名学生各自走向自己的座位，而他们的班主任无力地试图向全班讲话。

"Okay ladies, gentleman… and Toji."  
“好了，女士们，先生们……还有东治。”

"Hey!" “嘿！”

"I have yet _another_ transfer student to introduce to you all today."  
"今天我又要给大家介绍一位新转学生了。"

"How have we not run out of seats yet?" Shinji mumbled, still face-planting his desk.  
""我们怎么还没坐满呢？"" 真嗣咕哝着，依旧把脸埋在桌上。

"Is it _another_ hot girl?"  
"又是个漂亮女孩吗？"

"No Toji, is it not."  
"不是东治，对吧。"

"Thank god…" "谢天谢地……"

The whole class turned to face the gangly, tracksuited teenager, shock rippling through everyone's face. Even Shinji had raised his head to stare at him, wiggling his very raised eyebrows.  
全班同学都转头看向那个穿着运动服、身材瘦长的少年，震惊之情在每个人脸上蔓延。就连真嗣也抬起头盯着他，挑起了他那异常高耸的眉毛。

"What?" "什么？"

"It's not a hot girl and you're… happy?" Kensuke looked utterly dumbfounded. "Hikari, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but he might be into dudes now."  
"这不是个辣妹，你却……开心？" 真嗣看起来完全懵了。"光，我不得不告诉你，他现在可能对男人感兴趣了。"

The class president buried her head into her arms.  
班长把头埋进了双臂中。

"Where did I go wrong?!" She wailed. Shinji wasn't a hundred percent sure if she was putting it on or not.  
"我哪里做错了？！" 她哀嚎道。真嗣不太确定她是不是在演戏。

"Guys! Relax! All I'm sayin' is that I don't think I can survive anymore of Shinji's girlfriends."  
"伙计们！放松点！我只是说我觉得再这样下去，我可受不了真嗣的那些女朋友了。"

"There's certainly some wisdom in that." A nod from Kensuke and the majority of the class.  
"这话确实有道理。" 健司点头表示赞同，班上大多数人也同意。

"_WE'RE NOT HIS GIRLFRIENDS!"_  
"我们才不是他的女朋友！"

"Asuka… really? _Really?_" "明日香…真的吗？真的？"

"I'm technically his fiancé…" Rei piped up, raising a hand.  
"从技术上讲，我是他的未婚妻…" 绫波举手补充道。"

"I wouldn't mind being his _master…_" Crimson snuck a sly grin to her neighbour. Mana on Shinji's other side grabbed his arm, pulling it tight and in between her ample bosom.  
"我倒不介意成为他的主人…" 绯红向她的邻居投去一个狡黠的微笑。真嗣另一边的玛娜抓住他的手臂，紧紧地夹在她丰满的胸前。"

"Forget her Shinji. _You can be_ _**my**_ _master."_  
"忘了她吧，真嗣。你可以成为我的主人。"

A loud bang suddenly made everyone jump. Misato had hit the chalkboard behind her hard to get everyone's attention. Shinji couldn't have thanked her enough.  
突然一声巨响让所有人都吓了一跳。美里用力敲打身后的黑板，以吸引大家的注意。真嗣感激不尽。

"Guys. Transfer Student. _Shush_."  
"各位，转学生来了，安静。"

She motioned towards the open door, beckoning whoever was standing in the hall to come inside.  
她向敞开的门示意，招呼着站在走廊上的人进屋。

"I want you to treat him nice. And I promise he won't blow up the school... You won't blow up the school, right?"  
"我希望你能对他好点。我保证他不会炸了学校……你不会炸了学校，对吧？"

"I can honestly say the idea never came to mind." The silver-haired male finished writing his name on the board before turning around to face the class. _Oooh's_ and _aah's_ came from some of the girls who found their new classmate attractive.  
"老实说，我从未有过这种念头。" 银发男子在黑板上写完自己的名字后，转过身来面对全班。一些女生发出了'哦哦'和'啊啊'的赞叹声，她们觉得这位新同学很有魅力。

Shinji noticed something a little different about him.  
真嗣注意到他有些不同寻常的地方。

Specifically the fact that he had crimson eyes.  
具体来说，就是他有着猩红色的眼睛。  
Just like Rei did. Or at least one of them.  
就像绫波一样。或者至少是其中一个。

Smiling politely, he began his introduction.  
他礼貌地微笑着，开始了自我介绍。

"My name is Kaworu Nagisa. I look forward to our time together."  
“我叫渚薰。期待与你的时光。”

---

"KAWORU _WHAT!?"_ “渚薰，什么！？”

"Gendo, calm down." "源堂，冷静点。"

"NO!"

"Should I go get some ketamine?"  
"我该去弄点氯胺酮吗？"

"Kyoko, what the hell?" "京子，搞什么鬼？"

"HE'S SEELE'S POSTER BOY! HE WON'T JUST BLOW UP THE SCHOOL, HE'LL _NUKE_ IT!"  
"他是 Seele 的宣传招牌！他不会只是炸掉学校，他会把它核平！"

Gendo Ikari had called an emergency meeting, directing everyone to their posts before explaining to his impatient wife who this new transfer student really was. Half the story at least.  
碇源堂紧急召集了会议，指示所有人各就各位，然后向急不可耐的妻子解释这位新转学生的真实身份。至少说了一半的真相。

"Gendo, you still haven't told me, putting the nukes aside for a moment, what kind of a threat he actually is."  
"源堂，你还没告诉我，暂且不提核武器，他实际上到底构成了什么样的威胁。"

A grim silence descended upon the man until he finally found the words he could use to effectively describe what they were dealing with.  
那人陷入了严峻的沉默，直到他终于找到了能有效描述他们所面对威胁的词汇。

"As you know with the Mana Kirishima incident, Seele found a way to get their hands on _some_ of our technology. I don't know if its a spy in our midst, or once again Satsuki forgot to disconnect from Twitter-ing on the external networks, but thankfully what data they have is old and somewhat obsolete."  
"正如你在真奈·雾岛事件中所知，Seele 设法获取了我们的一些技术。我不知道是我们内部有间谍，还是萨津美又一次忘了在外部网络上断开 Twitter 连接，但幸运的是，他们掌握的数据已经过时且有些陈旧。"

"However, thanks to our own spy, we know that they took that data as a foundation and were able to come up with a bracelet all on their own. That's where Miss Kirishima's bracelet came from when we analysed it. Not only that but they managed to take a step in their own direction, without any regard to ethics and human experimentation…" He pushed the bridge of his glasses back up his nose, sighing.  
"然而，多亏了我们自己的间谍，我们知道他们以那些数据为基础，完全独立地研发出了这款手环。这就是我们在分析时发现的那款来自桐生萌郁小姐的手环。不仅如此，他们还迈出了自己的一步，完全不顾伦理和人体实验……" 他推了推鼻梁上的眼镜，叹了口气。

"This new boy. As far as I'm aware, instead of having to wear a bracelet, actually has a form of the technology embedded inside of him."  
"这个新来的男孩，据我所知，他不需要佩戴手环，实际上体内已经植入了这种技术。"

"You must be joking…" "你一定是在开玩笑吧……"

"I'm quite serious Yui. The kids are only 'deities' with the bracelets on, but this Kaworu. He is a literal walking god and from what I've been told, has no limiters on his abilities, unlike our kids who can be locked-out should someone go spontaneously insane."  
"我非常认真，Yui。孩子们只有在戴上手环时才是‘神’，但这个渚薰，他是个名副其实的行走之神，而且据我所知，他的能力没有限制，不像我们的孩子，一旦有人突然发疯就可能被封锁能力。"

"...I wouldn't put that past Asuka." Yui mumbled, much to Kyoko's chagrin.  
""……我倒不觉得明日香会那样。"" Yui 咕哝道，这让 Kyoko 感到沮丧。

"Instead of worrying about my daughter's sanity, should we not be coming up with a counterplan in case the new student **does** decide to go and kill everyone he sees?"  
"与其担心我女儿的理智，我们难道不应该制定一个应对计划，以防新来的学生真的决定去杀掉他看到的每一个人吗？"

"That's the whole reason we're here. So tell me ladies, any ideas?"  
"我们来这儿就是为了这个。所以，女士们，有什么想法吗？"

---

"So that's the gym. Not my favourite place on the campus, but compulsory education, whatcha gonna do, right?"  
"这就是体育馆了。虽然不是校园里我最喜欢的地儿，但教育必修课，你又能怎么办呢，对吧？"

"I heard there is a pool too. Is that in a different area?"  
"我听说这里还有个游泳池。是在不同的地方吗？"

"That's right, it's on the roof of the main school building."  
“没错，就在主教学楼的屋顶上。”

Thanks to the powers that be and Misato insisting that she had one of her imaginary staff meetings to attend to, Shinji had the colossal responsibility of guiding the new student around the school. She could have picked any number of the girls in his class fawning over his silver hair and chiselled jawline, but no. Shinji was a slave, both in the home and at school too.  
多亏了那些掌权者，以及美里坚持说她要去参加一个虚构的员工会议，真嗣承担起了引导新同学熟悉学校的巨大责任。她本可以选择班上任何一位迷恋他银发和雕刻般下颌线的女生，但偏偏没有。真嗣在家是仆人，在学校也一样。

Not that he minded. Kaworu seemed polite enough and was soaking in everything Shinji said like a sponge. His eyes were hijacking Shinji's curiosity but he didn't know how to bring it up without making things weird. He'd had enough of an awkward day going on as it was.  
倒不是说他介意。薰看起来很有礼貌，像海绵一样吸收着真嗣说的每一句话。他的眼睛激起了真嗣的好奇心，但他不知道如何在不把事情弄得尴尬的情况下提起。毕竟，这一天已经够尴尬的了。

"Is there something on my face? You appear to have found something of interest, Shinji Ikari."  
"我脸上有东西吗？你似乎发现了什么有趣的东西，碇真嗣。"

"Oh! Uh… No no no... and you can just call me Shinji by the way. Full names make things way too formal for me."  
"哦！呃… 没有没有… 对了，你可以直接叫我真嗣。全名让我感觉太正式了。"

"I understand. Though _is_ there something that's caught your eye?"  
"我明白了。不过，有什么东西吸引了你的注意吗？"

He was smiling in a way that suddenly made Shinji feel very bashful. One wrong word and the yaoi fangirls were going to go ape.  
他的笑容突然让真嗣感到非常害羞。只要说错一个字，那些耽美粉丝就要疯了。

"Okay, so… You've met Rei right? Rei Ayanami?"  
“好吧，那么……你见过绫波吧？绫波零？”

"Which one?" “哪一个？”

"Oh yeah, that's right, there's two of them now… Um, the one with the- _ahem…_ Red eyes?"  
"哦，对，没错，现在有两个了……呃，那个，红眼睛的那个？"

"Ahhh, I see now." Kaworu laughed, easing Shinji's tension slightly. Now that he thought about it, he never once questioned Rei about why her eyes were red either. Maybe it was because he had know her for so much longer that he'd become used to it?  
"啊，我现在明白了。" 渚薰笑着，稍微缓解了真嗣的紧张。现在想想，他从未质疑过绫波为什么眼睛是红色的。也许是因为他认识她更久，已经习惯了？

"Well, I'm not sure about our classmate. But I was born with some sort of eye infection that dyed the irises with blood. Thankfully the infection was prevented and I managed to retain my sight, but reverting my eyes to their natural color would undoubtedly be an extremely difficult process. One that carries too much risk and may end up robbing me of my sight."  
"嗯，我不太了解我们的同学。但我出生时患有一种眼病，导致虹膜染上了血色。幸运的是，感染得到了控制，我保住了视力，但要恢复眼睛的自然颜色无疑是一个极其困难的过程。这个过程风险太大，可能会让我失去视力。"

"That makes sense. I'm sorry if it said anything awkward. And your eyes are fine as they are. It just made me realize that there's a lot about the world I don't understand yet..."  
"那说得通。如果有什么话说得不得体，我很抱歉。而且你的眼睛现在这样就很好。只是让我意识到，对于这个世界，我还有很多不了解的地方……"

"You're welcome to ask anything at all Shinji. If I can help in any way, I'll be glad to do it."  
"你随时都可以问我任何问题，真嗣。如果我能帮上忙，我会很乐意。"

That answered his burning question, but also made Shinji curious about Rei once more. Maybe she had a similar problem with her eyes as a child? She had spent a lot of time in the hospital when she was younger, so it wasn't totally outside the realms of possibility.  
这回答了他迫切的问题，但也再次激起了真嗣对绫波的好奇。或许她小时候眼睛也有类似的问题？她小时候在医院待了很长时间，所以这并非完全不可能。

A few metres away from the duo, camouflaged in a way that could respectfully be called terrible, Asuka, Crimson, Mana and the two Rei's were spying on their conversation. Along with most of the other girls in the class dotted around the area.  
离那对组合几米远的地方，以一种堪称糟糕的方式伪装着，Asuka、Crimson、Mana 以及两位 Rei 正在偷听他们的对话。班上大部分女生也散布在周围。

"I don't like this." “我不喜欢这样。”

"They _could_ just be having a friendly conversation Asuka."  
“他们可能只是在友好交谈，Asuka。”

"They're practically holding hands Mana."  
"他们几乎是在牵手了，Mana。"

"I don't like this either." Crimson growled. "I'm going over there-"  
"我也不喜欢这样。"" 克里姆怒吼道，""我要过去——"

"_No you are not!"_ "不，你不能去！"

"You don't get to tell me what to do, you second-rate imposter. Nobody steals my things away from me."  
"你没资格命令我，你这个二流冒牌货。没人能从我这里夺走我的东西。"

"Yesterday you hated him. Then you bit him and then apparently woke up this morning crushing him in your boobs. Like, what's going on with that exactly?" Mana was glaring at Crimson with a look somewhere between envy and a pout.  
"昨天你还恨他。然后你咬了他，今天早上醒来却发现自己在用胸部压着他。到底是怎么回事？" 玛娜瞪着克里姆森，眼神中既有嫉妒又有不满。

"He's entertaining. He doesn't come with the emotional baggage of the apocalyptic world. He's a great cook and the Shinji from my world is both broken-"  
"他很有趣。他没有末日世界的情感包袱。他是个出色的厨师，而我世界的真嗣已经支离破碎——"

"Dead." Rei II helpfully pointed out.  
"死了。" 丽二好心地指出。

"That and helped destroy the world. And sure, I died too, but I realized something from my trip through Instrumentality."  
"不仅如此，还帮助毁灭了世界。当然，我也死了，但我在经历人类补完计划的过程中领悟到了一些东西。"

"That you're a future yandere?" Asuka cast a sidelong glance at her twin.  
"你将来会变成病娇吗？" 明日香斜眼瞥了瞥她的双胞胎妹妹。

"Very funny. More that I died focusing on the wrong things. I've got a chance at a normal life now and the first thing I want out of it is to redo that kiss!" And with that, Crimson bolted towards the two boys, with Mana in hot pursuit.  
"真是搞笑。我死前净关注些无关紧要的事。现在我有机会过正常生活了，我首先想重来的就是那个吻！" 话音刚落，Crimson 便向那两个男孩冲去，Mana 紧随其后。

"Did she say kiss?" It was Rei's turn to look jealous. Rei II looked at her own twin looking confused.  
"她说了吻吗？" Rei 的表情变得嫉妒起来。Rei II 看着自己的双胞胎兄弟，一脸困惑。

"What's a kiss?" "吻是什么？"

"Umm… well… it's…" Asuka decided to leave a furiously blushing Rei with her doppelganger to explain her way out of the hole she'd dug herself into and tore off to chase after the chaos that was about to unfold.  
"嗯…这个…其实是…" 明日香决定让满脸通红、手足无措的绫波丽自己解释如何摆脱这个尴尬局面，然后她急忙去追赶即将爆发的混乱。

"Shinji! Watch your six!" She bellowed, causing the teenage boy to jump out of his skin, turn around, freak out for a second time after seeing the barrage of girls sprinting towards him, offer a hasty goodbye to Kaworu and then proceeded to run for his life.  
"真嗣！注意你后面！" 她大声喊道，吓得少年魂飞魄散，转身一看，又被一群狂奔而来的女孩吓得再次惊慌失措，匆匆向渚薰道别后，便开始拼命逃跑。

"You idiot! Why did you open your stupid mouth!" Crimson yelled over her shoulder. All Asuka could offer in response was to stick out her tongue.  
"你这个白痴！干嘛多嘴！" 绛红在她身后怒吼。明日香只能吐吐舌头作为回应。

"Eh, whatever. It's always fun to chase your prey anyway." Crimson muttered with a smile.  
“呃，随便吧。反正追逐猎物总是很有趣的。”Crimson 低声笑着说。

Shinji, on the other hand, was panicking. He had no idea where to run, so he was pelting it towards the main building of the school, determined to find a door. Any door.  
另一方面，Shinji 则慌了神。他完全不知道该往哪儿跑，于是拼命朝着学校的主楼跑去，决心找到一扇门。任何一扇门。  
Eventually, he found a door, somewhere on the second floor of the building, belonging to what looked like an abandoned classroom.  
最终，他在大楼的二楼找到了一扇门，看起来像是废弃教室的门。

"Great. Now where can I hide myself." He looked around the room until his eyes came across a relatively big cardboard box.  
"太好了。现在我该藏哪儿呢。" 他环顾房间，目光最终落在一个相对较大的纸板箱上。

He grinned, his face resembling a mischievous fox.  
他咧嘴一笑，脸上露出狡黠的狐狸般的神情。

---

"Where did he go!?" "他跑哪儿去了！？"

"He's getting real good at not being caught…"  
"他越来越擅长不被抓到了…"

Crimson and Asuka respectively had burst into the room of Shinji's last known location. The other girls had split up to look in other places, leaving the two most likely to kill one another alone together.  
绫波零和明日香分别冲进了真嗣最后被发现位置的房间。其他女孩们已经分头去其他地方寻找，留下最有可能互相残杀的两人单独在一起。

"I don't see anyone in here…" Asuka was tired of searching. They had up-ended the school looking for the bastard in their measly lunch-break time but it wasn't long until it was time to go back to class.  
"这里也没人…" 明日香已经厌倦了搜寻。她们在短暂的午休时间里翻遍了整个学校，但不久就到了该回教室的时间。

"He owes me a bento. I don't care if I skip class, I'm finding him and throttling him until he coughs up my katsu bento!"  
"他欠我一个便当。我不在乎是否逃课，我要找到他，掐住他直到他把我的炸猪排便当吐出来！"

"I wouldn't be too partial to anything he _coughs up_ but whatever. And what about that kiss?"  
"我可不想吃他吐出来的东西，但随便了。那吻呢？"

"Oh, that's happening. I just haven't decided if its before or after I eat. I'm pretty freaking hangry."  
"哦，吻是肯定要发生的。我只是还没决定是在吃之前还是之后。我现在超级饿又超级生气。"

"Ugh, whatever…" "唉，随便吧…"

Shinji could hear the two girls creeping closer to his hiding place and was genuinely starting to get worried about getting caught. Rather, what they were going to do to him if he did get caught.  
真嗣能听到两个女孩悄悄接近他藏身之处，他真的开始担心被发现了。更确切地说，如果被发现，她们会对他做什么。

Granted, he'd thought using _Metal Gear_ tactics to escape sounded good in his head, but when did reality ever go as well as it did in video games?  
诚然，他认为使用《合金装备》的战术逃跑听起来不错，但现实何时能像电子游戏那样顺利呢？

"He's gotta be in here somewhere. We've checked everywhere else…"  
"他一定就在这里的某个地方。我们已经检查了其他所有地方……"

"I still can't believe you went into every men's toilet we passed… Everyone's going to think we're perverts…" Shinji came _this_ close to gasping in surprise at the revelation that Crimson had probably given half the male population of the school a heart attack.  
"我还是不敢相信你进了我们经过的每一个男厕所……大家都会以为我们是变态……" 真嗣差点因为得知绯红可能让学校一半的男生心脏病发作而惊呼出声。  
He almost went into cardiac arrest himself when Asuka crouched down, her striped-red panties in view for a split-second, right in front of his cardboard box and peeked through the hole on the side, locking eyes with him.  
当明日香蹲下身来，她那条纹红内裤在眼前一闪而过，透过纸箱侧面的洞口与他四目相对时，他几乎要心脏病发作了。

It was hard to tell who was the more surprised. Both teenagers had an expression akin to looking electrocuted. Asuka looked like she was about to open her mouth and say something when Crimson suddenly shouted from the other end of the room.  
很难说谁更惊讶。两个青少年都露出了像是被电击般的表情。明日香看起来正要张嘴说些什么，这时深红突然从房间的另一头大喊起来。

"Where the hell is he!? Anything over your side?"  
“他到底在哪儿？！你那边有什么发现吗？”

Asuka squinted through the hole, giving Shinji a meaningful glare, before responding.  
明日香透过洞口眯眼观察，意味深长地瞪了真嗣一眼，然后回应道。

"Nothing over here. Look, lunch breaks over. We can kill him when he gets back to class."  
“这边什么都没有。看，午休时间结束了。等他回教室我们再动手。”

"Ugh… fine." “呃……好吧。”

Crimson opened the door to the abandoned classroom violently before stomping away. Asuka waited a moment before whispering to the box.  
克里姆森猛地推开废弃教室的门，气冲冲地走了。明日香等了一会儿，然后对着盒子低声说道。

"You owe me for this, stupid Shinji."  
"你欠我一个人情，笨蛋真嗣。"

He definitely owed her. He also really didn't want to go back to class right now.  
他确实欠她人情。而且他现在真的不想回教室。

---

"WHERE WERE YOU!?" "你跑哪儿去了！？"

"I went outside the school for a quick second, I had to get something!"  
"我刚出学校一会儿，得去拿点东西！"

"LIES! I WANTED MY BENTO!"  
"胡说！我要我的便当！"

"It's inside your desk, moron!"  
"便当就在你桌子里，笨蛋！"

"IT IS NOT-oh shit, it is…"  
"不是吧-哦该死，真的是…"

"_Oh my god…_" "我的天啊…"

"But still! You owe me a kiss for making me waste my lunch break searching for you!"  
"不过话说回来！你欠我一个吻，为了找你我午休时间都浪费了！"

"A kiss!? WHAT!? **WHY!?**" "一个吻！？什么！？为什么！？"

Crimson and Shinji continued to bicker whilst the rest of the class looked on. Some were giggling at the romantic comedy scene playing out in front of them. Those with the bigger testes were wolf-whistling, though were quickly silenced when Crimson decided to chase them with a stapler. With her twin momentarily distracted, Asuka poked Shinji's back with a pencil.  
绫波和真嗣继续争吵，而班上的其他同学则在一旁观看。有些人因为眼前上演的浪漫喜剧场景而咯咯笑。那些胆子大些的吹着口哨，但很快就被绫波拿着订书机追赶的举动给吓得安静下来。趁着双胞胎姐姐暂时分心，明日香用铅笔戳了戳真嗣的背。

"So Crimson gets a kiss. You thought of what my reward is going to be yet?"  
"所以绫波得到了一个吻。你有没有想过我的奖励会是什么呢？"

"I haven't agreed to anything yet!"  
"我还没同意任何事呢！"

"You owe me a favor, remember…"  
"你欠我一个人情，记得吗…"

"That I do…" "确实如此…"

It was then their afternoon periods began, with the arrival of Honekawa-sensei postponing further discussion. Shinji couldn't ever remember a time he'd been looking forward to almost an hour of their wizened teacher's droning but with any luck, Crimson would fall asleep and leave him be for a while.  
那时，他们的下午课程开始了，Honekawa 老师的到来推迟了进一步的讨论。真嗣几乎记不起有哪次他曾期待过将近一小时这位老教师的喋喋不休，但愿幸运的话，绛会睡着，让他暂时清静一会儿。

"Hey Shinji." “嘿，真嗣。”

Of course, Crimson and Asuka weren't the only girls he had to deal with. Mana was tugging on his shirt from the seat to his left.  
当然，绛和明日香并不是他唯一需要应付的女孩。麻奈正从他左边的座位上拉扯着他的衬衫。

"Can I ask you for a favour?"  
"能请你帮个忙吗？"

"Is it going to hurt?"  
"会疼吗？"

"What? No." She rolled her eyes. "I need you to come with me somewhere after school. Alone."  
"什么？不会。"" 她翻了个白眼。""放学后我需要你单独跟我去个地方。"

"That's easily the most suspicious thing you could have said... Sure, why not. Might give me a break from the Soryu twins."  
"那绝对是你能说出的最可疑的话了……好吧，为什么不呢。或许能让我从惣流双胞胎那里喘口气。"

"That's what I was thinking." She giggled sweetly. After their afternoon period classes were over, Mana dragged him out of the class before Asuka or Crimson could get a word in. Sprinting at breakneck speed, Shinji was beginning to wonder where exactly she was kidnapping him to this time.  
"我也是这么想的。" 她甜甜地笑了起来。下午的课程结束后，真那在他还没被明日香或绛薰搭话之前就把他拽出了教室。以惊人的速度奔跑，真嗣开始好奇这次她究竟要把他带到哪里去。

"Here we go!" "我们走吧！"

"A bookstore? Is it real? Or is it one of those camouflaged BDSM shops?"  
"书店？是真的吗？还是那种伪装成 BDSM 店的？"

"What do you take me for?! Sometimes I want people to think I have a normal hobby from time to time!" Taking him by the hand, Mana dragged him inside. Shinji's eyes were darting everywhere, making sure he wasn't about to walk into a trap.  
"你把我当成什么了？！有时候我也想让别人觉得我有正常的爱好！" 说着，Mana 拉起他的手，拽着他进了店里。Shinji 的眼睛四处扫视，确保自己不会走进陷阱。

Surprisingly, everything about the shop looked normal. Mana had wandered over to the light novels, picked up the latest _Monogatari_ story and was lost to the world. Before Shinji decided to join her, he'd spotted a small in-store café. Deciding to buy two lattes, he brought the steaming takeout cups over to hallucinating bookworm and offered her one.  
出乎意料的是，这家店的一切看起来都很正常。Mana 已经走到轻小说区，拿起最新的《物语》系列故事，完全沉浸其中。在 Shinji 决定加入她之前，他注意到店内有一个小咖啡馆。决定买两杯拿铁，他拿着热腾腾的外带杯走到那个沉迷于书海的女孩面前，递给她一杯。

"Thank you Shinji!" "谢谢你，真嗣！"

"No problem. Did you just want company then?"  
"没事。那你只是想要个伴吗？"

"Sort of. I love these books, but coming into a shop to buy them by myself was a little nerve-wracking…"  
"算是吧。我非常喜欢这些书，但自己一个人进店买书还是有点紧张……"

"Eh? Blowing up a school is all good, but walking into a harmless bookstore is where you draw the line?"  
"嗯？炸学校都无所谓，但走进一家无害的书店就让你犹豫了？"

"It's more… I have to pretend to be normal. That's the hardest part about all of this." Her eyes never left the book she was reading. She seemed to be engrossed in the story, whilst somehow being able to have a conversation at the same time.  
""更多的是…我必须假装正常。这才是这一切中最难的部分。"" 她的目光始终没有离开正在阅读的书。她似乎完全沉浸在故事中，同时又能进行对话。

"From where I'm standing, you look perfectly normal to me."  
"在我看来，你看起来完全正常。"

"Even though you know I was a spy, now a godhand-wielding high school girl with a traumatic past and stalkerish tendencies?"  
"即便你知道我曾是个间谍，现在是个挥舞神器的、有着创伤过往且有点跟踪狂倾向的高中女生？"

"Normal is pretty overrated anyway. You're far more interesting like this. And besides, some of that applies to me too."  
"反正正常也挺被高估的。你这样更有趣。而且，有些方面我也适用。"

"Wait, are you _stalking_ me Shinji?!" Mana giggled, reminding him of how cute she could be when she wasn't blowing things up. "I guess I wouldn't mind, if it was you."  
"等等，你在跟踪我吗，真嗣？！" 玛娜咯咯笑道，让他想起她不搞破坏时有多可爱。"如果是你，我倒不介意。"

"I'll… keep that in mind?"  
"我会…记住的？"

Shinji decided to read some stories too, standing next to Mana as it started to rain outside the shop. The soft pitter-patter of the rain on the windows and skylights made for a beautiful orchestra of noise as they both fantasized about the worlds they were lost in. The outside looked cold, but he could feel the faint body heat coming from Mana, mere centimeters away from his right arm. It was a very cozy feeling.  
真嗣决定也读些故事，站在麻那旁边，外面开始下雨了。雨滴轻轻敲打在窗户和天窗上，形成了一曲美妙的自然交响乐，他们俩都沉浸在自己所迷失的世界中。外面看起来很冷，但他能感觉到从麻那身上传来的微弱体温，距离他的右臂仅几厘米。这种感觉非常舒适。

"Hey Shinji…" "嘿，真嗣…"

"What's up Mana?" "怎么了，麻奈？"

"This is nice. Isn't it?"  
"这样挺好的，不是吗？"

### Chapter 17: A Mother's Embrace  
第十七章：母亲的怀抱  

The Artificial Research Laboratory was in chaos.  
人工研究实验室陷入了一片混乱。

Alarms were blaring, scientists and security were running around wildly, areas of the complex were being locked down, it was utter pandemonium.  
警报声此起彼伏，科学家和安保人员四处奔走，实验室的部分区域被封锁，场面一片混乱。

Gendo, Yui, and Kyoko sat in the command centre, fearing the worst. Yui looked over towards her husband, a rare look of fear etched into her expression.  
源堂、唯和京子坐在指挥中心，心中充满最坏的预感。唯望向她的丈夫，脸上罕见地刻着恐惧。

"What do we do?" Her eyes looked lost. She felt her whole life coming apart at the seams. Her husband was in his traditional signature pose, as he usually was during times of crises like this. But even behind his tinted glasses, Yui could see that the man who could keep his composure in most situations was panicking. His response never came, his eyes fixated on the large monitor in front of him. Satsuki, Kaede and Aoi were sitting at their posts, barking orders.  
“我们该怎么办？”她的眼神显得迷茫。她感到自己的生活正从缝隙中崩解。她的丈夫保持着他一贯的标志性姿势，通常在这样危机的时刻也是如此。但即便隔着墨镜，唯也能看出，这个在大多数情况下都能保持镇定的人正在恐慌。他没有回应，目光紧盯着面前的大屏幕。萨斯吉亚、枫和葵坐在他们的岗位上，大声下达命令。

"The MAGI are at a 32% intrusion level! Sever the network links with the outside!"  
“MAGI 的入侵程度已达 32%！切断与外部网络的连接！”

"The virus is… mutating!? Nothing we do is stopping it! Morphing the logic is having no effect!"  
病毒正在……变异！？我们的一切努力都无法阻止它！改变逻辑结构毫无效果！

"Vice Director, what do we do!?"  
副所长，我们该怎么办！？

Yui bit her lip. This was a bold move, even for SEELE. Everything they had been working on for _years_… All the research and data. All of it! Teetering on the knife's edge of being totally stolen away. Their contribution to not only the future of the children but to all of humanity was mere moments away from ending up in the hands of the fools that would rather see the world go to ruin.  
Yui 咬紧了嘴唇。这对 SEELE 来说也是大胆的一步。他们多年来为之努力的一切……所有的研究和数据。所有的一切！正处在被彻底窃取的边缘。他们不仅对孩子们的未来，更是对全人类的贡献，即将落入那些宁愿看到世界毁灭的蠢货手中。

This spectre had been haunting them for long enough. It was time to deal with the ghost in the machine.  
这个幽灵已经困扰他们够久了。是时候处理这台机器里的鬼魂了。

Yui whipped out her phone, speed dialling a number in the swift action it took to get from phone to ear.  
Yui 迅速掏出手机，以迅雷不及掩耳之势拨通了一个号码，手机随即贴到了耳边。

"Misato, bring the kids. I want them to do some ghostbusting."  
“美里，带上孩子们。我要他们去捉鬼。”

---

"I love your mother, I really do… But her references are showing her age. And in doing so, it's making _ME_ feel old!"  
"我爱你的妈妈，真的……但她的那些老掉牙的典故，真是让我也感觉自己老了！"

"I hate to break it to you Misato but the chicken that represents your life is no longer in it's Spring. If anything, I'd say the first leaves that drop in the Fall are a better representative than-… _HEY_!" Asuka's scathing remarks were rudely interrupted by Misato's swerving Alpine taking the inclines of the road as ramps.  
""我不想打击你，美里，但代表你生命的那只鸡已经过了青春期。要说的话，我觉得初秋落下的第一片叶子更能代表你……嘿！"" 明日香尖刻的评论被美里驾驶的阿尔派突然转向，将路面斜坡当作跳台的举动粗暴打断。

"I've never seen the Fast and Furious movies but I'd stop Asuka, before we start to reenact them-… gurghhh!" The car landing back on its wheels managed to shock the air out of Shinji before he had a chance to delicately finish his sentence. His lunch was threatening to paint the car interior with bile and judging from the hue on Asuka's face shifting slowly to a greenish colour, she wasn't far behind.  
""我从来没看过《速度与激情》系列电影，但我觉得在开始重现它们之前，明日香，你最好停下来——呃！"" 车子重新着地，震得真嗣一口气没上来，话也没说完。他的午饭眼看就要在车内涂上一层胆汁，而从明日香脸上逐渐转为青绿色的脸色来看，她也快撑不住了。

"Anymore smartass comments and I'll show you my drifting skills next, _Asuka_." Misato grinned evilly. The ride back to the Artificial Research Lab was significantly quieter after that.  
"再敢耍嘴皮子，下次我就给你展示我的漂移技术，明日香。" 美里邪恶地笑着。之后返回人工研究实验室的路上，气氛明显安静了许多。

Rolling into the lab's underground car park, Misato had the kids up the command centre as quick as possible, give or take a few detours and consulting a technician for directions.  
驶入实验室的地下停车场，美里迅速带着孩子们前往指挥中心，期间绕了几次路并咨询了一位技术人员以确定方向。

"You've been here how many times Misato!? God, I'm so embarrassed…"  
"你来过这里多少次了，美里？！天啊，我真是太尴尬了……"

"Yeah, thanks for all your help Asuka, you've been here before too!"  
“是啊，谢谢你的帮助，明日香，你也来过这里！”

"All of once! Why on earth would the Ikari's make this place a labyrinth? How do _they_ ever find their way around this place?"  
“就一次！伊卡里家为什么要把这个地方弄成迷宫？他们怎么在这里找到路的？”

Skidding into the command centre, all three of them panted, desperately trying to get some oxygen into their lungs. Yui grinned weakly at the dramatic entrance.  
三人滑进指挥中心，气喘吁吁地试图让氧气进入肺部。唯虚弱地对这戏剧性的入场笑了笑。

"Glad to see you eventually made it."  
"很高兴你终于到了。"

"No problem at all. But if I may make a request, can someone give me a map? Would be _really_ useful to get these guys here as quickly as possible." Misato wheezed. Shinji spotted a familiar blunette standing behind his mother.  
"完全没问题。不过如果可以的话，能给我一张地图吗？这样能尽快把这些人送到目的地。"" 美里喘着气说。真嗣注意到一个熟悉的蓝发女孩站在他母亲身后。

"Rei! When did you get here?"  
"绫波！你什么时候来的？"

"I had to do some testing, so I left school early…" Rei looked at him, almost pouting. "Did you even _notice_ I had gone?"  
"我得做些测试，所以提前离开了学校……" 丽看着他，几乎要噘嘴了。"你注意到我走了吗？"

"Well, I…" His words had magically chosen that moment to not appear out of thin air.  
"嗯，我……" 他的话仿佛在那一刻神奇地选择不从空气中冒出来。

"It's not even the end of lunch break, you could've been in the bathroom! You were right there with us up until the bell rang at the end of last period. You've been here like… thirty minutes before we got here!" Asuka, still trying to catch her breath, came to his rescue. The two girls glared at each other.  
"甚至还没到午休结束，你可能是去洗手间了！直到上一节课结束铃响，你都还和我们在一起。你比我们早到这儿……三十分钟呢！" 明日香还在努力喘气，过来帮他解围。两个女孩互相瞪着对方。

"MAGI intrusion is at seventy percent! Vice Director, whatever you're planning, you better get them to it asap!" Satsuki bellowed from her workstation. Shinji and the others could now see that things were a lot more serious than they realised. All the technicians looked incredibly stressed, the large monitor was filled with warnings and errors. Shinji saw 'MAGI' and what looked like a slowly filling graph pulsing red splashed across the screen.  
“MAGI 入侵已达百分之七十！副所长，无论您计划什么，最好尽快让他们行动起来！”萨斯吉的声音从她的工作站传来。真嗣和其他人现在意识到情况远比他们想象的严重。所有技术人员看起来都非常紧张，大屏幕上满是警告和错误信息。真嗣看到‘MAGI’和屏幕上似乎在慢慢填充的红色脉冲图表。

"Wait, is this…?" “等等，这是……？”

"_SEELE_." His father grunted his overly large desk. His eyes were fixated on the screen. Shinji had never seen him look so serious.  
“SEELE。”他的父亲在巨大的办公桌后咕哝着。他的眼睛紧盯着屏幕。真嗣从未见过他如此严肃。

"Mom, what's going on?" "妈妈，发生什么事了？"

"You heard your father. SEELE have decided to play a game with us. And if we lose, it threatens the future as we know it." Shinji noticed his mother was also struggling not to scowl at the monitors above them. Things were much worse than he thought.  
"你听你父亲说了。SEELE 决定和我们玩一场游戏。如果我们输了，我们所知的未来将受到威胁。" 真嗣注意到他的母亲也在努力不向他们头顶的监视器皱眉。情况比他想象的要糟糕得多。

"In order to combat and resolve the situation, we need you three to help us." Yui suddenly had a tablet in her hand, rapidly scrolling through the data. "Your bracelets will be key, but unfortunately, we can't just wave them and hope this situation will go away. So, in order to use them effectively, we're going to be sending you _into the MAGI_ _itself_ in order to defeat the virus."  
"为了应对并解决这一局面，我们需要你们三个的帮助。" 唯突然手中多了一个平板电脑，迅速滚动着数据。"你们的手环将是关键，但遗憾的是，我们不能仅仅挥挥手就指望这种情况会消失。所以，为了有效地使用它们，我们将把你们送入 MAGI 系统内部，以击败病毒。"

There was a long silence at the end of her explanation. Asuka and Shinji looked at each other for a moment before returning their gaze to the lead scientist of the Artificial Research Laboratory.  
她的解释结束后，是一阵长久的沉默。明日香和真嗣对视了一会儿，然后将目光转回到人工研究实验室的首席科学家身上。

"…_wut_?" “…啥？”

"I think she means we're going into a virtual reality… Right Auntie?" Rei's voice piped up in the distance, standing next to Gendo's desk.  
“我想她的意思是我们要进入虚拟现实…对吧，阿姨？” 绫波的声音从远处传来，站在碇的办公桌旁。

"Well done Rei, that's right."  
"干得好，丽，没错。"

"Wait, VR? Like with those headsets? Ooh, I've always wanted to play _Beatsaber_…"  
"等等，VR？就像那些头戴设备？哦，我一直想玩《节奏光剑》……"

"No Asuka. It's not going to need a headset. But I suppose it wouldn't be too far off to call the experience a game…" Yui lifted her eyes from the tablet and glanced up at them.  
"不，明日香。它不需要头戴设备。但我想，称之为一种游戏体验也不算太离谱……" 绫波从平板电脑上抬起眼睛，瞥了她们一眼。"

"Misato, can you take them to the VR room? I've sent a map to your phone. Yes, yes, I know, you're welcome. Actually…" Yui suddenly looked thoughtful. "Get them into their plug suits first. I feel like they're going to need them."  
"美里，你能带他们去 VR 室吗？我已经把地图发到你手机上了。对，对，我知道，不用谢。其实……" 唯突然若有所思。"先让他们穿上插入栓服。我觉得他们会需要的。"  
Ignoring Misato's cheer of finally getting hold of a way to navigate the maze that made up the facility, Asuka and Shinji looked at each other again in confusion.  
无视美里终于找到方法穿越错综复杂设施的欢呼，明日香和真嗣再次困惑地对视。

"What's a plug suit?"  
"插入栓服是什么？"

---

"You have _**got**_ to be kidding me…"  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧…"

"They're a bit…" "他们有点…"

Both Shinji and Asuka were holding the answer to the question that had bugged them all the way from the command centre. Misato hadn't said a word. Instead, she had been content to irritate them with giggles. Rei hadn't said anything either, but both Shinji and Asuka noticed the wild blush that had threatened to consume her face.  
真嗣和明日香都握着从指挥中心一路困扰他们的问题的答案。美里一句话也没说。相反，她只是满足于用咯咯的笑声来激怒他们。丽也没有说什么，但真嗣和明日香都注意到了她脸上那几乎要蔓延开来的狂野红晕。

Now they knew the reason for it. A bright red suit made from what felt not too far from latex was dangling from Asuka's outstretched hand. Holding it as though it was made from the excrement of animals, Asuka looked at Misato, aghast.  
现在他们明白了其中的缘由。一件鲜红色的紧身衣，触感近似乳胶，正悬挂在明日香伸出的手上。她拿着它，仿佛那是动物粪便制成的东西，明日香惊愕地看着美里。

"Please tell me this is some sort of sick joke."  
“请告诉我这只是某种恶心的玩笑。”

"Unfortunately not Asuka. Some of the experiments here require a suit that has a bunch of cutting-edge technology in them. I don't know _how_ they work exactly, but trust me, they're important."  
“不幸的是，并非如此，明日香。这里的一些实验需要穿上集成了许多尖端科技的服装。我不太清楚它们具体如何运作，但相信我，它们至关重要。”

"But… _**WHY**_!?" Asuka raged out the last syllable. "It looks, and there's no other word for it, _**kinky!**_ And not in a good way!"  
"但…为什么！？" 明日香愤怒地喊出最后一个字。"这看起来，找不到其他词来形容，就是变态！而且不是好的那种！"

Misato let out a hearty laugh. "I can't totally disagree with you there. If you have a problem with the design, you'll need to take it up with the guys that run this place."  
美里发出一阵爽朗的笑声。"我完全同意你的看法。如果你对设计有意见，你得去找管理这个地方的人谈谈。"

"Rei, you not going to put yours on?" The blunette was looking very anxious, her blush not having yet dissipated yet.  
"丽，你不打算穿上吗？" 蓝发少女显得非常焦虑，她的脸颊上的红晕还未消退。"

"For the purpose of the experiments, I never questioned it before but…" She looked nervously at Shinji. "But… I share Soryu's sentiment. Wearing it in front of Shinji is going to be… difficult."  
"为了实验的目的，我以前从未质疑过，但是……" 她紧张地看着真嗣。"但是……我和惣流有同样的感受。在真嗣面前穿这个会……很困难。"

"Oh for the love of…" Misato walked towards the girls, suddenly grabbed them both by the waist and plopped them both on each shoulder.  
"哦，真是的……" 美里走向女孩们，突然抓住她们的腰，将她们分别放在自己的两个肩膀上。

"_**MISATO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING**_!?"  
"美里，你在干什么！？"

"Miss Katsuragi, please, this is embarrassing!"  
“葛城小姐，请别这样，太难为情了！”

"If we wait until you guys are ready to do this, SEELE will kill us all. Oh, and Shinji?" Misato nodded towards the men's changing room. "When you do put on the suit, make sure you press the button on your left wrist. That'll match the form of the suit to your measurements. I know it looks a bit oversized now, but it'll fit, trust me."  
“如果我们等到你们都准备好了再行动，SEELE 会把我们都干掉的。哦，还有，真嗣？”美里朝男更衣室点了点头，“当你穿上这套装甲时，记得按一下左手腕上的按钮。它会根据你的身材调整装甲的尺寸。我知道现在看起来有点大，但相信我，它会合身的。”

With that, the three girls disappeared, the sounds of indignation getting quieter. Shinji sighed and looked at the blue and white suit in his hand. There was no avoiding it. He wandered over to the door of the men's changing room, but not before he heard an embarrassed scream come from the ladies.  
说完，三个女孩便消失了，不满的声音也逐渐减弱。真嗣叹了口气，看着手中的蓝白套装。这是无法避免的。他走向男更衣室的门，但在那之前，他听到了从女士那边传来的一声尴尬的尖叫。

"_I MIGHT AS WELL BE NAKED!_" He heard Asuka rage. That didn't bode well for his own suit. Stripping off his clothes, he debated about wearing his underwear. His initial instinct was yes but maybe it might cause problems?  
“我简直就像没穿衣服一样！”他听到明日香愤怒地吼道。这对他的防护服可不是个好兆头。他脱掉衣服，犹豫着是否要穿上内裤。起初的本能反应是肯定的，但也许这会引起问题？

Shaking his head and realizing that they never got any instruction about it, he decided to keep his boxers on. For emotional support if nothing else.  
他摇了摇头，意识到他们从未得到任何相关指导，于是决定还是穿上内裤。至少为了情感上的支持。  
It was a lot baggier than he had expected. Pulling the strangely rubbery material over his shoulders, it felt more like a clownish fat suit than something used for cutting-edge science. He did notice some bits on the suit that looked like they might be sensors, including the bright red jewel looking object on his chest. The suit also came with what looked like sensors to put in his hair, almost like the hair accessories Asuka liked to wear.  
这套衣服比他预想的要宽松得多。他将那奇怪的橡胶质感材料拉过肩膀，感觉更像是个滑稽的胖大褂，而不是用于尖端科学的装备。他注意到衣服上有一些像是传感器的部件，包括胸前那个鲜红色的宝石状物体。衣服还附带了一些看起来像是用于头发的传感器，几乎像是明日香喜欢戴的发饰。

After sorting them out and making sure the suit was on as best as possible, he looked at his left wrist.  
整理好一切并尽可能完美地穿上战衣后，他看向自己的左手腕。

"Is this it… WOAH!" A sound like air being sucked up a vacuum suddenly hissed all around his body. The suit rapidly compressed around him, clinging to his skin all over. It wasn't uncomfortable, but the material felt odd to him. He'd never worn anything like this before.  
“这就是了……哇哦！”一阵仿佛被吸尘器吸入的空气声突然在他全身周围嘶嘶作响。战衣迅速压缩，紧贴着他的皮肤。虽然并不难受，但这种材质让他感到陌生。他从未穿过类似的东西。

It really was as skintight as Asuka's cry earlier had made it out to be. Suddenly getting an uncomfortable thought, he looked down at his gentleman's area, aware that any kind of thoughts that would set _that_ off would be visible from a mile away. Grimacing at the reality, he promised himself to only think clean thoughts when he saw Asuka and Rei.  
确实如明日香之前的惊呼所言，这件衣服紧贴得如同第二层皮肤。突然间，他产生了一个不安的想法，低头看向自己的私密部位，意识到任何会引起反应的念头都会一览无余。面对这个现实，他暗自发誓，在见到明日香和绫波时，只会有纯洁的念头。

It was hopeless. It had been approximately a nanosecond before he covered his groin in the presence of his two suited comrades. Rei was wearing a pure white suit that accented absolutely _everything_ and Asuka was very much the same but in a completely red outfit. At least in their school uniforms, you couldn't tell immediately but in the plug suits, Asuka clearly had a size advantage in the breasts department. Rei had a rump that put her back in the competition easily, but they both also had a significant feature around their groin areas that reminded Shinji very much of the toes of an animal that you would usually find crossing deserts.  
这真是无望了。就在大约一纳秒前，他在两位西装革履的同伴面前遮住了自己的下体。丽穿着一身纯白色的西装，完美地衬托出她的每一处曲线，而明日香也几乎一样，只不过是一身全红的装扮。至少在学校制服里，你不会立刻察觉到，但在插入栓服中，明日香在胸部方面明显占优势。丽则拥有一个让比赛重新变得激烈的翘臀，但她们俩在胯部区域都有个显著特征，让真嗣不禁联想到通常在穿越沙漠时会遇到的动物的蹄子。

"Yeah, yeah, get it out of your system." Asuka grimaced, well aware that Shinji _had_ been trying his best not to _look_ like he was looking. "We can see your leaning tower of Pisa attempting to wave hello, we're not blind either."  
“是啊，是啊，尽情发泄吧。”明日香皱眉说道，她很清楚真嗣一直在尽力不让自己看起来像是在偷看。“我们能看到你那座倾斜的比萨塔试图挥手打招呼，我们也不是瞎子。”

"Wait, what? What tower?" Rei squinted at Shinji, scanning him over until she reached the lower half. "Oh… Ohhhh…"  
“等等，什么？什么塔？”丽眯起眼睛看着真嗣，仔细打量着他，直到目光落在了下半身。“哦……哦哦……”

It was time to get the party back to the command centre.  
是时候把派对带回指挥中心了。

"Oh my, they look even better than I thought they would!" Yui Ikari beamed at seeing the three suited-up teenagers return.  
"哦天哪，他们看起来比我想象的还要好！" 看到三个穿着战斗服的少年归来，Yui Ikari 露出了灿烂的笑容。

"With all due respect Vice Director, it feels a bit… revealing…" Asuka nervously glanced all over herself. She'd been fighting the urge to clobber Shinji the whole way back but decided not to out of pity. The poor guy basically waddled back whilst trying his best to cover the silhouette of his unmentionables. All the blood in his body seemed to have gone to his face thankfully, so she left his punishment to mother nature to dole out.  
"恕我直言，副指挥官，这感觉有点……暴露……" 明日香紧张地四处打量自己。她一路上都在努力克制着想要揍真嗣的冲动，但出于同情决定不这么做。可怜的家伙基本上是一路蹒跚着回来，同时尽力遮掩着他的隐私部位的轮廓。幸运的是，他全身的血液似乎都涌到了脸上，所以她决定让自然法则来惩罚他。

"I understand it's not the most fashionable thing in the world, but it does really help us out with the science side of things." Yui smiled weakly. "Also, you can just call me Ikari y'know. Or even just Yui. Or even Auntie, like Rei does! It feels weird hearing _Vice Director_ from you guys…" Something resembling the shadow of a pout flickered across the lead scientist's face.  
"我知道这可能不是世界上最时髦的东西，但它确实在科学方面帮了我们大忙。" 唯微笑得有些无力。"而且，你们可以直接叫我碇，或者干脆叫唯，甚至像丽那样叫我阿姨也行！听你们叫副所长感觉怪怪的……" 首席科学家脸上闪过一丝类似撅嘴的阴影。

"Yui come on. You're running the show here, it's not a surprise she has no idea how to refer to you." A familiar voice echoed from one of the workstations across the command centre. Asuka's eyes immediately lit up, woes about her suit completely forgotten.  
"唯，拜托。你在这里是掌舵的，她不知道怎么称呼你也不奇怪。" 一个熟悉的声音从指挥中心对面的一台工作站传来。明日香的眼神立刻亮了起来，对她的制服的烦恼完全抛诸脑后。

"Mama!" Asuka ran over to her mother, grabbing her in a big hug. It was a surprise to see the blonde scientist out of her lab. Shinji couldn't remember the last time he had actually seen Kyoko Soryu. He'd been convinced that she had become a permanent sort of hermit down there, texting colleagues for food deliveries and forgetting to have regular showers. But the woman that greeted them looked as fit as a fiddle and perfectly hygienic, if a little sleepy.  
"妈妈！" 明日香跑向她的母亲，紧紧地抱住了她。看到这位金发科学家离开实验室真是意外。真嗣记不清上次见到草薙京子是什么时候了。他一直以为她已经变成了那种永久性的隐士，通过发短信让同事送食物，并忘记定期洗澡。但迎接他们的女人看起来精神抖擞，卫生状况良好，只是有点困倦。

"Sorry it's been a while, my little Asuka! These guys keep me pretty busy!"  
"抱歉，久等了，我的小明日香！这些家伙让我忙得不可开交！"

"I hate to interrupt this touching reunion but…" The burly voice of a troubled Gendo Ikari boomed from his desk, before-  
"我不愿打断这感人的重逢，但是……" 一个低沉而焦虑的声音从碇源堂的办公桌传来，随后——

"MAGI Intrusion at eighty-five percent! Guys, _do something_!" The tech team seemed to be at their wits end keeping the intrusion at bay. Kyoko returned to her terminal, apologizing to her daughter.  
"MAGI 系统遭到百分之八十五的入侵！伙计们，快采取行动！" 技术团队似乎已经竭尽全力在抵御入侵。绫波零回到她的终端前，向女儿道歉。

"I'm sorry Asuka but I need to help them. Let Auntie Yui fill in the rest!"  
"对不起，明日香，但我需要帮助他们。让 Yui 阿姨来补充剩下的吧！"

"She's right." Yui Ikari once again took up the reins of the operation. "Misato, take them to the VR room. I'll be in communication when you get there. And guys…" She looked at the three kids, worry clouding her face. "Please, be careful in there."  
"她说得对。"" 碇唯再次接管了行动的指挥权。""美里，带他们去 VR 室。你们到了那里后我会保持联系。还有，孩子们……"" 她看着三个孩子，脸上满是担忧。""请在里面小心点。"

---

The VR room looked very familiar. To Shinji and Asuka, it was the room where they first discovered what exactly it was that Shinji's parents were experimenting with. The bare room with nothing inside but white walls was back.  
VR 室看起来非常熟悉。对真嗣和明日香来说，这是他们第一次发现真嗣父母究竟在实验什么的地方。那个空荡荡的房间，只有白色墙壁，又回来了。

"_However, this room is not the same. It's been extensively tuned and refitted with mechanisms that can extend its length and width, as well as provide safety. Unfortunately, Misato can't join you in there until she gets her own plug suit-_"  
"然而，这个房间并不一样。它经过了大量调整和改装，配备了可以延伸其长度和宽度的机械装置，以及提供安全保障。遗憾的是，直到美里获得她自己的插入栓服之前，她无法进入那里——"

"_I'M GETTING A PLUG SUIT TOO!?_" Shinji and Asuka both mentally agreed that their guardian and teacher sounded way too excited with that bit of information.  
"我也要穿插入栓服！？" 真嗣和明日香都在心里认同，他们的监护人和老师对这个消息显得过于兴奋了。

"…_-so she will be monitoring you both via a smaller control centre over there. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to give you all a briefing so we're going to be explaining things to you on the fly. We'll be launching the experiment in ten seconds. Brace yourselves!"_  
"……-所以她将通过那边的一个小型控制中心监控你们俩。遗憾的是，我没有时间给你们做简报，所以我们将在实验进行中向你们解释。实验将在十秒后启动。做好准备！"

On his left, Rei looked nervous. Suddenly she yelped in surprise. Shinji had gently started to hold her hand.  
在他左边，丽看起来很紧张。突然，她惊叫了一声。真嗣轻轻地握住了她的手。

"It's going to be alright Rei."  
“丽，一切都会好起来的。”

She had participated in a fair few experiments at the lab, helping Auntie and Uncle. But this one felt a lot more overwhelming. The future of the lab was at stake and she didn't want to mess up. She squeezed Shinji's hand gently in return, thankful for the reassurance.  
她在实验室参与了不少实验，帮助阿姨和叔叔。但这次感觉格外沉重。实验室的未来悬而未决，她不想搞砸。她轻轻回握了真嗣的手，感激这份安慰。

"Yeah. It'll be okay… I think."  
"嗯，会没事的……我想。"

Shinji suddenly felt his other hand being clasped. Turning his head, he saw Asuka looking straight ahead at one of the blank walls.  
真嗣突然感到另一只手被握住了。他转过头，看到明日香正直视着一面空白的墙壁。

"You better not forget about me Shinji. It's not just Rei you need to look after." She was trying not to show anything, but her face was slightly tinged red. Smiling, he squeezed her hand too.  
"你最好别忘了我，真嗣。不只是丽需要你照顾。"" 她尽量不表现出什么，但脸颊微微泛红。他微笑着，也握紧了她的手。

"Yeah. I don't want to let anything happen to you either."  
"是啊。我也不想让你受到任何伤害。"

"Good! Then let's go kick this thing's ass and go home!"  
"好极了！那我们就去狠狠教训这玩意儿，然后回家吧！"

"_T-MINUS 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, START!"_  
"倒计时 5，4，3，2，1，开始！"

The world around them erupted into a kaleidoscopic abstract flurry of colours. The three teenagers awed at the world around them, looking as though they had dived headfirst into a radiant galaxy. Shinji was immediately reminded of a school trip to the planetarium a long time ago. However, what they were seeing now was making that experience pale in comparison. It wasn't long before the lightshow around them ended and they were suddenly greeted with the sight of-  
周围的世界爆发成一片万花筒般的抽象色彩旋风。三个青少年惊叹于四周的景象，仿佛一头扎进了一个璀璨的银河。真嗣立刻想起了很久以前一次学校组织的去天文馆的旅行。然而，现在他们所见之景，让那次经历相形见绌。不久，环绕他们的光影秀结束，他们突然被眼前的景象所迎接——

"Wait, is this our classroom?"  
“等等，这是我们的教室吗？”

---

"I brought them, Vice Director." The voice of a man who looked to be in his early 30s appeared in the command centre.  
“我把他们带来了，副指挥。”一个看起来三十岁出头的男子的声音在指挥中心响起。

"Ah, Kaji! It's good to see you again!" Yui Ikari glanced over at him, noting the ponytail that forever irked her was still present. Behind the smiling man were two girls. Crimson, with her ever present scowl was glaring at Yui. The scientist could understand why the Asuka lookalike usually had an angry disposition but it always felt like she done something to the irritated teenager personally.  
"啊，加持！再次见到你真好！" 碇唯瞥了他一眼，注意到那根永远让她不爽的马尾依旧存在。微笑的男人身后站着两个女孩。绛红，总是带着不满表情的她正瞪着碇唯。科学家能理解为什么这个酷似明日香的人通常带着愤怒的情绪，但总感觉她对这位烦躁的少女做了什么似的。

Standing at a comfortable distance away from the angry redhead, Rei II had also joined them, with a curious expression. To her, especially with the large gaps in her memory, this must feel like the first time standing in a facility like this, Yui reasoned to herself.  
站在愤怒的红发少女稍远的地方，绫波零也加入了他们，带着好奇的表情。对她来说，尤其是记忆中存在大片空白的情况下，这一定像是第一次站在这样的设施里，碇唯暗自推理。

"I just hope it isn't going to bring back any unpleasant memories, especially at a time like this." She thought to herself.  
"我只希望这不会唤起任何不愉快的记忆，尤其是在这个时候。" 她暗自思忖。

"So why are we here... _And what the hell are they_ _**wearing**_!?" Crimson had spotted the monitoring window on the huge display in front of everyone. On it, she could clearly see Shinji, Asuka and Rei in their plug suits.  
“所以我们为什么会在这里...还有他们到底穿的是什么鬼东西！？” Crimson 注意到了大家面前巨大显示屏上的监控窗口。通过它，她可以清楚地看到穿着插入栓服的 Shinji、Asuka 和 Rei。

Yui suddenly realised why the girl looked ready to boil water with her face. Crimson's eyes raged with the fire of a supernova. On the day that Shinji had brought Crimson home, alongside the amnesiac Rei and the creepy ghost, they had all been wearing similar suits. Asuka's suit was an almost perfect recreation of the one that Crimson had worn from her own world. And it was no coincidence either.  
Yui 突然意识到为什么女孩看起来像是要用脸煮开水了。Crimson 的眼睛里燃烧着超新星般的怒火。那天 Shinji 把 Crimson 带回家时，还有失忆的 Rei 和那个诡异的幽灵，他们都穿着类似的服装。Asuka 的服装几乎完美再现了 Crimson 在自己世界中所穿的款式。而这绝非巧合。

Yui and the rest of the scientists had analysed the suits from the mysterious other world and had realised that they did indeed contain useful functions, such as life support and various other sensors that gave real-time monitoring abilities to many of the body's functions. They had been deemed useful and became an integral part of the experiments.  
Yui 和其他科学家们分析了来自神秘异世界的服装，并发现它们确实包含了一些实用功能，比如生命维持系统和各种实时监测身体机能的传感器。这些服装被认为非常有用，并成为了实验不可或缺的一部分。

In the beginning, Yui hadn't been overly ecstatic using them. Using technology from a world that sought to basically destroy itself wasn't chiming with her moral compass. But the logic in her scientifically geared brain won out in the end. After all, any tool could be used for good, not just evil.  
起初，Yui 对使用这些技术并不感到特别兴奋。使用一个基本自毁的世界的技术，与她的道德指南针并不合拍。但最终，她那偏向科学的逻辑思维占了上风。毕竟，任何工具都可以用于善，而不仅仅是恶。

But she had completely forgot about what it might do to the mental stability of the teenagers from the destroyed world. Judging from Crimson's expression, it was about to rain blood-  
但她完全忘记了这可能对来自那个被毁灭世界的青少年的心理稳定造成的影响。从 Crimson 的表情来看，血雨即将来临——

"ARE YOU JOKING!? PLUG SUITS!? WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS HIDING A GODFORSAKEN ANGEL IN THE _FUCKING_ BASEMENT TOO?"  
“你在开玩笑吗！？插件服！？什么，你们是不是还在地下室藏了一个该死的天使？”

"No! We just need them to- "  
"不！我们只是需要他们去——"

"TO WHAT!? No, don't even say it! I've heard this schtick before! Giant, soul-powered robots, fighting messengers of God but _actually_… no! Vessels, to initiate a world-ending apocalypse, all to resurrect a dead wife and stick it to some Illuminati _dickheads_ and turn all of humanity into some giant Haunted-Mansion style blob in the sky where EVERYONE gets to see all of your secrets and memories. The _fucking_ janitor in that world from my old school has memories of me getting off to the translucent baka and god forbid I can't bloody look him in the eye in this one! Everyone's dead, the sea's blood red, Ayanami's _fucking_ face just chilling in it, grinning at the _fucking_ moon, not to mention being the size of one. And you know what…" The temperature of the room was _Arctic_. No one dared breath as Crimson slowly but purposefully walked up to Gendo Ikari.  
"去干什么？！不，别说出来！我以前听过这套说辞！巨大的、由灵魂驱动的机器人，对抗神的使者但实际上……不！容器，为了引发世界末日的天启，全都是为了复活死去的妻子，打击那些光明会的混蛋，然后把全人类变成某种巨大的、像鬼屋一样的天空中漂浮的团块，在那里每个人都能看到你所有的秘密和记忆。我以前的学校里那个清洁工有我对着半透明笨蛋自慰的记忆，天哪，我在这个世界里简直不敢直视他的眼睛！所有人都死了，海水血红，绫波零的脸就那么漂浮其中，对着月亮咧嘴笑，更别提它有那么大了。而且你知道吗……" 房间的温度如同北极般寒冷。没有人敢呼吸，克里姆森缓缓但坚定地走向碇源堂。

"It was All. Your. Fault."  
"这一切都是你的错。"

No one knew what kind of expression lay behind the orange-tinted spectacles of the Commander. His signature pose suggested a sense of stoicism, but under the façade, Yui knew that Gendo Ikari, the leader of the Artificial Research Laboratory, the man who braved facing off against the likes of SEELE, was absolutely _freaking out_.  
没有人知道指挥官橙色镜片后的表情是什么样的。他标志性的姿态暗示着一种坚忍，但在表面之下，Yui 知道，Gendo Ikari，人工研究实验室的领导者，那个敢于直面 SEELE 之类的人，绝对是在抓狂。

"I do believe this is the first time we've met, Miss…"  
“我相信这是我们第一次见面，小姐……”

"Crimson! I may share the same name as the other, but I am not the same Asuka! I am one that _YOU DESTROYED_! Along with an entire planet!" A long silence followed. Everyone bar a few scientists had been completely distracted by the drama unfolding in front of them. It wasn't everyday you saw the Commander being absolutely bullied by a teenager.  
“Crimson！我可能和其他人同名，但我不是同一个 Asuka！我是被你摧毁的那一个！连同一整个星球！”长时间的沉默随之而来。除了少数几位科学家，所有人都被眼前上演的戏剧完全吸引了。不是每天都能看到指挥官被一个青少年彻底欺负的。

"Miss… Crimson. I do not know what it was like in the world you came from, I cannot possibly even begin to fathom the darkness that swallowed up the planet. We do not intend to keep secrets from you, or Rei, about what it is we do here. But I ask you to understand. We are _not_ NERV. We don't have weapons here of any kind. There are no… Angels, to fight. The only thing that stands in our way of providing a future for the generations ahead, is SEELE. A name that I am aware you are familiar with. What we do here is research, and experiment, in order to progress humanity. Not to conglomerate it in a false sense of paradise. We defend ourselves against SEELE, not with weapons but with science. We use the tools that we develop with good intentions, including what you see the children wearing. It is not an indication that we have malicious intentions." Gendo sighed, pushing up his glasses.  
“Miss… Crimson。我不了解你来自的那个世界是怎样的，我无法想象吞噬了整个星球的黑暗。我们无意对你或零隐瞒我们在这里所做的事情。但我请求你理解。我们不是 NERV，这里没有任何武器。没有……天使，需要对抗。我们唯一的阻碍是 SEELE，这个名字我相信你并不陌生。我们在这里所做的是研究与实验，为了推动人类进步，而不是在虚假的天堂中聚集。我们用科学而非武器来抵御 SEELE。我们使用的是出于善意的工具，包括你看到的孩子们所佩戴的。这并不意味着我们有恶意。”碇源堂叹了口气，推了推眼镜。

"I realise that it will be nearly impossible for you to accept any of this. Anything I say about it is words echoed from a man that resembles the chaos from where you came from. So all I can do it show you the actions we take here with full transparency and…" Almost everyone in the room silently gasped in surprise. Gendo Ikari, the man with an image to maintain, _had just taken off his glasses._ Standing on his feet, he gave his full attention to Crimson. _And bowed._  
"我意识到，要你接受这一切几乎是不可能的。我对此所说的任何话，都只是从一个与你来自的混乱之地相似的人那里传来的回声。所以我只能向你展示我们在这里采取的行动，保持完全的透明度，并且……" 房间里几乎每个人都默默地倒吸了一口气，感到惊讶。碇源堂，这个有着形象需要维护的男人，刚刚摘下了他的眼镜。他站起身来，全神贯注地面对着绯红。然后鞠了一躬。

"Apologize, for the trauma you have been through. Miss Soryu-… no. Miss Crimson, I am sorry for what you have been through. And I can assure you, we are going to do anything we can to stop evil from taking root in this world and prevent another apocalypse in this one."  
"为你们所经历的创伤道歉。绫波小姐……不，绯红小姐，我为你们所经历的一切感到抱歉。我可以向你保证，我们将尽一切努力阻止邪恶在这世界上扎根，并防止这个世界再次陷入末日。"

There was another long silence.  
又是一阵漫长的沉默。

"I am not going to help. If that's the reason you brought me here, you can think again."  
"我不会帮忙的。如果这就是你带我来这里的原因，那你还是再想想吧。"

"We will not force you to do anything."  
"我们不会强迫你做任何事。"

"Fine then. I'm going home."  
"那好吧。我要回家了。"

"Asuka!" It was her mother's voice. A voice she had not heard in a very, _very_ long time. She knew an incarnation of her mother existed here, but out of fear, Crimson had not sought her out. Her memories were painful enough.  
“明日香！”那是她母亲的声音。一个她许久未曾听闻的声音。她知道这里存在着她母亲的转世，但出于恐惧，绯红未曾去寻找她。她的记忆已足够痛苦。

She found herself unable to move. Frozen to the spot. She wanted to run away. To hide at the ends of the earth. She was afraid. Afraid of her memories. Afraid of that voice. Afraid of herself.  
她发现自己动弹不得，僵立在原地。她想逃跑，躲到天涯海角。她害怕，害怕那些记忆，害怕那个声音，害怕她自己。

"Asuka…" Dr Kyoko Soryu took a tentative step forward. She could see the girl referring to herself as Crimson shaking all over. Another step forward. Kyoko wanted to reach out, to console the girl trapped in the throes of her own mentality, after all of the suffering. But Kyoko could see that any sudden moves would cause Crimson to flee. She'd done enough running. She needed to heal.  
“明日香……” 绫波京子博士小心翼翼地向前迈了一步。她能看到自称绯红的女孩浑身颤抖。又一步向前。京子想要伸出手，安慰那个深陷自我心魔中的女孩，毕竟经历了那么多苦难。但京子看得出，任何突然的动作都会让绯红逃走。她已经逃得够多了，她需要治愈。

"Everything is all right now. Everything is going to be okay."  
"现在一切都好了。一切都会好起来的。"

"You. You're…" Crimson felt her throat locking up. She hated it. She wanted to scream. To shout. To let this imposter know her place. She wasn't her real mom. But…  
"你。你是…" Crimson 感到喉咙哽住了。她讨厌这样。她想尖叫。想大喊。想让这个冒牌货知道她的位置。她不是她的亲生母亲。但是…"

She couldn't bring herself to do it. Why? It was just words… Right? She couldn't even face looking at the scientist right now. A tsunami of hot, angry tears was threatening to flow and destroy her where she stood. So, she remained there, frozen in place, not sure of what to do.  
她无法让自己这么做。为什么？这只是些话…对吧？她甚至无法直视那位科学家。一股热泪的巨浪即将涌出，摧毁她所站立的地方。因此，她依旧站在那里，僵在原地，不知该如何是好。

_Did Shinji ever feel like this?  
真嗣曾经有过这种感觉吗？_

Kyoko made it around to stand in front of the stricken girl. Worry was etched over the blonde scientist's face as she searched for the light of hope in the trauma taking over Crimson's mind. The girl's breathing was increasing in pace. She looked ready to crumble into dust at the merest touch of a light wind.  
响子绕到前面，站在那个受创的女孩面前。担忧刻在金发科学家的脸上，她寻找着希望之光，试图穿透正在侵蚀绯红心灵的创伤。女孩的呼吸越来越急促，她看起来就像一阵微风就能将她吹散成尘埃。

Stretching out her arms, Kyoko was about to embrace the girl, not knowing what else to do to soothe her pain. But before she could-  
响子伸出双臂，正准备拥抱女孩，不知道还有什么办法能缓解她的痛苦。但在她能这么做之前——

"You… told me… to die."  
"你…让我…去死。"

Once again, the room froze. All eyes were on the two in the middle of the command centre. Most of the people there had only heard fragments of Crimson's story. Only Yui, Gendo, Kyoko and the other children knew what Crimson was talking about.  
又一次，房间陷入了死寂。所有目光都聚焦在指挥中心中央的两人身上。在场的大多数人只听说过关于 Crimson 故事的片段。只有 Yui、Gendo、Kyoko 和其他孩子们知道 Crimson 所指的是什么。

"I…" Kyoko was lost for words. She heard what happened. The Shinji and Asuka from her world had relayed as much information that they had managed to glean from Crimson. But it still wasn't really enough to explain the sheer magnitude of what she had gone through.  
"我…" Kyoko 无言以对。她听说了发生的事情。她所在世界的 Shinji 和 Asuka 尽可能多地向她转述了从 Crimson 那里得到的信息。但即便如此，仍不足以解释她所经历的巨大痛苦。

"The Contact… Experiment…" Crimson could barely breath. Trickles of tears started to flow down her face. But she had long since given up trying to stop them. What did it matter anyway?  
"接触……实验……" 绯红几乎无法呼吸。泪水开始顺着她的脸颊流淌。但她早已放弃试图阻止它们。反正又有什么关系呢？

"The day I lost you, was the day I was told I was going to be an Evangelion pilot. I was proud, I couldn't wait to tell you. But truthfully, I had lost you long before that. The woman I knew as Kyoko Soryu, my mother, died the day she decided to sell her soul to those abominable creations. The only thing that was left was a husk of a women, driven mad, convinced that a stupid doll was her daughter, not the living, breathing child that begged her to get better every day. And in the end, not only did you kill yourself… But you tried to take me with you."  
"我失去你的那天，正是我被告知将成为 EVA 驾驶员的那天。我感到自豪，迫不及待想告诉你。但事实上，我早已失去了你。我所认识的绫波响子，我的母亲，在她决定将灵魂出卖给那些可憎的造物的那天就死了。剩下的只是一个被疯狂驱使的女人，坚信一个愚蠢的玩偶是她的女儿，而非那个每天恳求她好起来的活生生的孩子。最终，你不仅自杀了……还试图带我一起走。"

"That was it. From that point on, I couldn't be a normal child anymore. I had to be there for myself, because no one would. The only thing anyone ever cared about me for was piloting an Eva. Everyone except… _him_. And I even managed to destroy that shred of happiness too."  
"就这样。从那一刻起，我再也不能做一个普通的孩子了。我必须为自己而存在，因为没有人会。唯一关心我的人只是因为我能驾驶 EVA。除了他。而我甚至毁掉了那最后一丝幸福。"

"Maybe… If I had been nicer to him… The world might not have ended. Maybe I could've helped him to actually save the world. Maybe part of the reason that world is now an actual hell, is because I let it happen…"  
"或许……如果我当时对他更友好一些……世界可能就不会终结。也许我本可以帮助他真正拯救世界。也许那个世界如今变成地狱的一部分原因，是因为我放任了它的发生……"

"Maybe if… If I had a mother, who was there for me, the whole way… I would've turned out better. But you… You left me. _All alone_. In a world full of despair and destruction. Why!? WHY!?" Tears had become sobs. Every negative emotion was coming out, aimed squarely at the woman who stood in front of her. She wanted to scream to the ends of the earth. She wanted to shout until she lost her voice. She wanted to cry until she couldn't anymore. She wanted… What she really wanted…  
"也许如果……如果我有一个始终陪伴我的母亲……我会变得更好。但你……你抛弃了我。独自一人。在一个充满绝望和毁灭的世界里。为什么！？为什么！？"" 泪水变成了抽泣。每一种负面情绪都在涌出，直指站在她面前的女人。她想要向地球的尽头尖叫。她想要喊到失声。她想要哭到无法再哭。她想要……她真正想要的是……

Arms wrapped around her. Tightly. Warm. An embrace, for the first time she could remember in forever.  
双臂环绕着她。紧紧地。温暖地。一个拥抱，是她记忆中久违的第一次。

"No… No… I don't…!" Crimson tried to beat away, to break free of the embrace. She wanted it so badly, but she was so angry. So sad. Miserable. She had no strength to break away. So all she could do was stand there, and sob into the chest of Kyoko Soryu. Her mother.  
“不…不…我不要…！”绛红试图挣脱，想要摆脱这个拥抱。她如此渴望，却又如此愤怒。如此悲伤。如此痛苦。她没有力气挣脱。所以她只能站在那里，将脸埋进草薙京子的胸前，她的母亲，哭泣着。

"I'm so sorry… I'm so sorry… Asuka." Kyoko had managed to hold back her own sobs just as well as Crimson had. Both women had let their knees collapse onto the ground, still embracing each other.  
“我很抱歉…我很抱歉…明日香。”京子设法像绛红一样抑制住了自己的哭泣。两位女性都让膝盖瘫软在地，依然紧紧相拥。

Yui Ikari looked on at them both, a paralytic agony dancing around her heart. What Crimson had gone through was exactly what they were trying to avoid. She didn't want anyone else to go through what Crimson had to suffer through. She would make sure of it.  
碇唯注视着她们两人，心中痛苦得仿佛被麻痹。绛红所经历的正是他们试图避免的。她不希望任何人再经历绛红所承受的痛苦。她会确保这一点。

As if to temper her determination, alarms began ringing throughout the command centre.  
仿佛是为了考验她的决心，警报声开始在指挥中心内响起。

"MAGI intrusion at ninety percent, we have to _hurry_!"  
"MAGI 系统遭到九十百分比的入侵，我们必须加快速度！"

"_Guys, we could really use your help right about now!_" Shinji's voice blared through the monitor's. Everyone looked up to see the progress of his mission with the other Asuka and Rei. Things were not looking good.  
"伙计们，我们现在真的需要你们的帮助！" 真嗣的声音通过监视器传来。所有人都抬头看向屏幕，关注着他与其他版本的明日香和绫波的任务进展。情况看起来并不乐观。

### Chapter 18: The Least Expected Scenario

"Shinji! Watch your back!"  
“真嗣！小心背后！”

An explosion rocked the school corridor. It might be VR but everything felt incredibly real. If it wasn't for Asuka's yell, he would have been thrown out of the window and onto the harsh tarmac outside. VR or not, that was going to hurt a lot.  
学校走廊发生爆炸。虽然是虚拟现实，但一切都感觉异常真实。要不是明日香的大喊，他可能已经被炸出窗外，摔在坚硬的地面上。无论是虚拟还是现实，那都会非常痛苦。

In his hands, he held a pistol. If Kensuke were here, he'd have spent a decent amount of time being lectured on how it was an M1911, how it was one of the most famous weapons of all time and all the wars it had ever been in, _ad nauseum._  
他手中握着一把手枪。如果剑介在这里，肯定会花上不少时间被教导这是 M1911，它是史上最著名的武器之一，以及它参与过的所有战争，等等等等，让人听得反胃。

To Shinji, it was a gun that fired bullets. Not that he had ever fired a weapon outside of a video game before. It felt like they were using actual bullets too, judging from all the holes in the wall from their missed shots. It was pretty loud too.  
对真嗣来说，这只是一把发射子弹的枪。他从未在电子游戏之外开过武器。从墙上那些他们射偏留下的弹孔来看，感觉他们用的像是真子弹。声音也相当大。

"_Did they have to replicate the weapons this accurately?"_ Shinji thought as he ducked into an empty classroom, hot on Asuka's tail.  
“他们有必要把武器做得这么逼真吗？”真嗣一边想着，一边躲进一间空教室，紧追在明日香身后。

It all started when they found themselves plonked into their classroom after entering the VR room.  
一切始于他们发现自己被传送进了教室，就在进入 VR 房间之后。

Things had become weird in short order.  
事情很快就变得诡异起来。

---

"So… why the school?" Asuka looked around. When the technology the bracelets had been based on was first shown to Asuka and Shinji, one of their tasks had been to imagine a location familiar to them. She had imagined their school classroom, and the location was bringing back memories of that first time but now school was laced with a sense of danger.  
“那么……为什么是学校？”明日香环顾四周。当最初展示给明日香和真嗣手环所基于的技术时，他们的任务之一就是想象一个对他们来说熟悉的地方。她想象了他们的学校教室，这个地点唤起了第一次的记忆，但现在学校却笼罩着一种危险的气息。

"_So luckily when it comes to these skirmishes with SEELE, we seem to be able to decide the place, although unfortunately, they get to decide when."_ Misato's voice blared out from an invisible speaker somewhere above their heads.  
"幸运的是，在与 SEELE 的这些小规模冲突中，我们似乎能够决定地点，尽管不幸的是，他们可以决定时间。" 美里从头顶某个看不见的扬声器中大声说道。

"_The school was decided as everyone here has ample knowledge of its layout, hopefully giving us some tactical advantages-"_  
"学校被选定是因为这里的每个人都对它的布局有充分的了解，希望这能给我们带来一些战术优势——"

"Wait, Misato… what's that?" Asuka had spotted several _things_ floating around outside of the classroom. They looked like jewels, something like rubies about the size of a human head, levitating a few feet from the ground.  
"等等，美里……那是什么？" 明日香在教室外发现了几样漂浮的东西。它们看起来像宝石，类似红宝石，大小约有人头那么大，离地面几英尺悬浮着。

They reminded Shinji of the red object implanted in his suit.  
它们让真嗣想起了植入他作战服中的红色物体。

"_Those would appear to be your enemies, Asuka."_  
“那些似乎是你的敌人，明日香。”

They didn't look very threatening. They did make Shinji feel unnerved, almost as if he recognized them from somewhere.  
它们看起来并不十分具有威胁性。但它们确实让真嗣感到不安，仿佛他在某个地方认得它们似的。

"So we just have to take them out?" Asuka's bracelet glowed red and suddenly she was holding a gun. Shinji vaguely recognised the shape from a James Bond movie. A voice in his head that sounded a lot like Kensuke Aida helpfully reminded him that it was a Walther P99.  
"所以我们只需要把它们干掉？" 明日香的手镯发出红光，转眼间她手中握着一把枪。真嗣隐约从一部詹姆斯·邦德电影中认出了这把枪的形状。他脑海中一个听起来很像相田健介的声音友好地提醒他，这是一把瓦尔特 P99。

The weapon made a loud cracking noise, as deafening as he would imagine a real-life pistol to sound. Quickly followed was the sound of shattering glass as one of the classroom windows into the corridor collapsed. A bright red flash suddenly shone through the windows as one of the ruby-like objects popped out of existence.  
武器发出一声响亮的爆裂声，震耳欲聋，正如他想象中现实生活中的手枪声一样。紧接着是玻璃破碎的声音，教室通向走廊的窗户崩塌了。一道鲜红的闪光突然透过窗户射进来，其中一个红宝石般的物体突然消失不见了。

"Really? That's it? This is gonna be easy!" Asuka grinned as she fired off her weapon a few more times. Red flashes followed her wake as she ran out of the classroom and down the corridor. Her gleeful giggling started to sound downright maniacal to Shinji and Rei.  
"真的吗？就这样？这太简单了！" 明日香一边笑着，一边又开了几枪。她跑出教室，沿着走廊奔跑，身后留下一串红色的闪光。她的欢快笑声开始变得对真嗣和绫波来说近乎疯狂。  
Both had their hands to their ears, their dislike for loud noises on full display.  
两人都捂着耳朵，对巨大噪音的厌恶之情表露无遗。

"Hey Misato, those bullets aren't… live ammo are they?" Shinji asked fearfully. All they needed right now is the gun-crazy Asuka to accidentally hit them with friendly fire.  
“嘿，美里，那些子弹不是……实弹吧？”真嗣害怕地问道。他们现在最不需要的就是疯狂的明日香不小心对他们进行友军射击。

"_If I'm reading this right… If you get hurt in the VR world, the system is going to 'simulate' pain. In other words, it's probably going to hurt a lot but probably not as much as if you'd been shot in real life. That being said, if you receive the equivalent of what would normally be a fatal injury, the system pulls you out.  
“如果我没理解错的话……如果你在虚拟现实中受伤，系统会‘模拟’疼痛。换句话说，可能会很痛，但可能不会像现实生活中被枪击那样痛。也就是说，如果你受到相当于通常致命伤害的打击，系统会把你拉出来。”  
The good news is that that means infinite respawns! But we don't have a good deal of time to be working with so hopefully it won't come to that…"  
好消息是，这意味着无限复活！但我们没有太多时间可以浪费，希望不会走到那一步……_

"We better get after her…" Shinji glanced at Rei. Nodding back, she ran out of the classroom, Shinji following close behind.  
“我们最好追上去……” 真嗣瞥了一眼绫波。绫波点头回应，跑出教室，真嗣紧随其后。

---

With his ears ringing and his kill count steadily climbing, Shinji had his back pressed up against Asuka's, firing for all he was worth. His pistol was on the ground, out of ammo, with Shinji not having any time to reload it. He was currently holding an M4 assault rifle, something Asuka had summoned and thrown to him in the heat of battle.  
真嗣的耳朵嗡嗡作响，击杀数稳步上升，他紧贴着明日香的背，全力开火。他的手枪已经掉在地上，弹药耗尽，真嗣没时间重新装填。他现在正拿着一把 M4 突击步枪，这是明日香在激战中召唤并扔给他的。

The Rubycores (as Asuka had helpfully designated them), had multiplied ferociously. It turned out that they could fire small lasers, sort of like blasters from every space movie ever. All three had been hit at least once by one of the lasers, which stung like hell on impact, but had a slightly more emotionally distressing effect, especially for the girls.  
红宝石核心（这是明日香贴心的称呼），已经疯狂繁殖。事实证明，它们能发射小型激光，有点像所有太空电影中的爆能枪。三人都至少被激光击中过一次，那种冲击痛得要命，但对女孩们来说，情感上的打击更为严重。  
Whenever a beam landed on target, it would melt the suit a little, revealing skin underneath. The effect normally produced a hole in the suit about the size of an adult hand. Asuka had been caught on her naval and slightly under her left breast, Rei had a couple of holes on her back and several going down her legs and Shinji had the great misfortune of having one on his left buttcheek.  
每当光束命中目标，就会稍微熔化装甲，露出下面的皮肤。通常会在装甲上造成一个成人手掌大小的洞。明日香被击中在肚脐和左乳下方，绫波背后有几个洞，腿上也有几处，而真嗣则不幸地被击中了左臀。

Thanks to the revelation of the suit-melting weaponry, both girls had turned the insanity up to the nth degree. Asuka had been firing RPGs and grenade launchers, switching to katanas and twin daggers for close quarters combat, howling the whole time.  
由于这种熔化装甲的武器被揭示，两位女孩将疯狂程度提升到了极致。明日香一直在发射火箭筒和榴弹发射器，切换到武士刀和双匕首进行近战，全程咆哮着。

Rei was… _wild._ He was starting to think there were many layers to the red-eyed girl he still didn't know, but he certainly hadn't been expecting her to be wielding a submachine gun with one hand whilst killing close quarter enemies with a claw gauntlet on the other. He was briefly reminded of the time Rei had been showing how the bracelets worked originally, asking Shinji if he thought her armour gauntlet had been nicer than the one Asuka had summoned that day.  
丽……狂野。他开始觉得这个红眼女孩有着许多他尚未了解的层面，但绝对没料到她会一手挥舞着冲锋枪，另一手用爪形护手近战杀敌。他短暂地回想起丽最初展示手镯功能时，问过真嗣是否觉得她的盔甲护手比那天明日香召唤的那个更漂亮。

The memories blasted out of his head when a grenade exploded, decimating many of the Rubycores. The corridor was a mess, it genuinely looked like a warzone, with spent ammo casings, destruction and scorch marks everywhere. The Rubycores didn't leave corpses, but Shinji could almost imagine what it might look like if they had.  
一颗手榴弹的爆炸将这些记忆从他脑海中炸飞，大量红玉核心被摧毁。走廊一片狼藉，真的像战场一样，到处是弹壳、破坏痕迹和烧焦的痕迹。红玉核心不会留下尸体，但真嗣几乎能想象出如果它们会留下尸体会是什么样子。

"Mi… Sa… To…" Asuka breathed, desperately trying to oxygenate herself. "When… does this nightmare… end…?"  
“美……沙……斗……”明日香喘息着，拼命试图让自己呼吸。“这噩梦……何时……才能结束……？”

"_I wish I could tell you… Another wave is coming from the gymnasium to your position. You've got maybe two minutes before they're on to you…"_  
"我希望我能告诉你……又一波敌人正从体育馆向你逼近。你大概还有两分钟就会被他们发现……"

"Oh my GOD!" Asuka growled, checking her weapons and ammo, summoning anything that was depleted. "We've got to come up with a plan!"  
"哦，我的天哪！" 明日香咆哮着，检查武器和弹药，召唤任何耗尽的资源。"我们必须想出一个计划！"

It was like fighting in a zombie survival game, with waves that seemed to get more and more aggressive. They were allowed a brief respite between waves, but things seemed to get more and more challenging every time another wave started.  
这就像是在玩僵尸生存游戏，一波接一波的敌人似乎越来越凶猛。他们每波之间有短暂的喘息时间，但每次新一波开始时，情况似乎都变得更加艰难。

"What about Mom and Dad? Any bright ideas from them?" Shinji had his hands on his knees, panting after a quick reload. Rei was not fairing much better, a visible amount of sweat glistening over her face.  
"妈妈和爸爸呢？他们有什么好主意吗？" 真嗣双手撑在膝盖上，快速装填后喘着粗气。绫波也没好到哪儿去，脸上明显有汗水闪烁。

"_They… uhhh… appear to be having a bit of a situation on their hands at the moment…"_  
"他们……呃……目前似乎遇到了点麻烦……"

"Wait, what!? Are they okay?"  
"等等，什么！？他们还好吗？"

"Uhh… don't worry about that! Your mom and dad are just having a uhh… chat with uhhh… Crimson…" Misato glanced nervously at the other monitor broadcasting the command centre. Things were looking emotional to say the least. It didn't help that she could _hear_ everything that was going on in one ear, and also being able to hear Shinji and the others within the VR environment in the other. It was like trying to watch a soap drama with one eye and an action movie with the other. Her head was spinning. Did the Artificial Research Laboratory have healthcare that covered therapy?  
"呃…别担心那个！你妈妈和爸爸只是在和…呃…Crimson…聊天…" Misato 紧张地瞥了一眼播放指挥中心画面的另一台显示器。情况可以说是相当情绪化了。更糟糕的是，她一只耳朵能听到那边的一切动静，另一只耳朵还能听到 Shinji 和其他人在 VR 环境中的声音。这感觉就像是用一只眼睛看肥皂剧，另一只眼睛看动作片。她的头都快晕了。人工研究实验室的医疗保险包括心理治疗吗？

Shinji and the others weren't paying attention her anymore. The next wave had started in earnest… but something was different.  
Shinji 和其他人已经不再关注她了。下一波攻击已经正式开始…但有些不同。

"Misato!?"

On her monitors, Misato could see a humanlike form instead of the regular Rubycores. It was still the same colour, but it was unmistakeably a clone of Shinji. It was as though someone had taken their Shinji Ikari and drowned him in ruby-coloured paint.  
在她的监视器上，美里看到一个类人形而非常规的红宝石核心。颜色依旧，但那无疑是真嗣的克隆体。仿佛有人拿走了他们的碇真嗣，把他浸在了红宝石色的颜料里。  
The paint was starting to evaporate, a red misty steam rising from the clone, until it revealed a perfect replica of the Shinji they knew, complete with his regular school uniform. The most disturbing part was that it was grinning, _evilly_.  
颜料开始蒸发，从克隆体上升起红色的雾状蒸汽，直到露出他们所熟知的真嗣的完美复制品，连同他平常的校服。最令人不安的是，它正邪恶地咧嘴笑着。

"_Kids, you have to run! Get away from him!"_  
“孩子们，你们得跑！离他远点！”

The trio didn't need telling twice. They ran from the destroyed corridor, moving towards the staircase.  
三人无需多言，立刻从被毁的走廊逃离，朝着楼梯跑去。

"We have to get outside. Bottlenecking the cores worked for a while but they keep pincer manoeuvring us. We need more open space!" Nobody had the time to disagree with Asuka, but as they made their way to the staircase, more Shinji clones began to walk up the stairs, all with the same evil grin plastered on their faces. Shinji swore he could see a red glow from their eyes.  
“我们必须到外面去。用瓶颈战术暂时有效，但他们不断用钳形战术对付我们。我们需要更开阔的空间！” 没人有时间反驳明日香，但当他们向楼梯移动时，更多的真嗣克隆体开始走上楼梯，每个脸上都挂着同样的邪恶笑容。真嗣发誓他能看到他们眼中的红光。

Two bullet holes appeared above the clones, accompanied by the sounds of the gunshots.  
两个弹孔出现在克隆体上方，伴随着枪声响起。

"Asuka, you missed!? You're like three feet away from them, how did you miss!?"  
"明日香，你居然没打中！？你离他们才三英尺远，怎么可能打不中！？"

"It's harder to kill these things when they…"  
"这些家伙看起来像你的时候，更难下手……"

"_When they look like you, baka Shinji!"_ Asuka gritted her teeth, forcing herself to remember that these things were just clones. Not human beings, not her Shinji. Just bastardized mimics of her one and only treasure. Flipping the pin on a grenade, she lobbed it down the stairs before grabbing both Rei and Shinji's hand.  
"当它们看起来像你的时候，笨蛋真嗣！" 明日香咬紧牙关，强迫自己记住这些只是克隆体。不是人类，不是她的真嗣。只是对她唯一珍宝的拙劣模仿。她拔掉手榴弹的保险销，扔下楼梯，然后抓住绫波和真嗣的手。

"Back past the classroom, there's another stairwell. Hopefully that one isn't overrun with bakas!" Asuka dragged them into the direction they started at, a deafening explosion in their wake.  
“绕过教室，还有另一座楼梯。希望那儿没有被笨蛋们占领！”明日香拽着他们回到最初的方向，身后是一声震耳欲聋的爆炸。

After having made it to the other side of the school, Asuka's eyes lit up when she saw the stairwell, only to turn into fires of rage when she saw more figures slowly walking up the stairs.  
好不容易穿过学校到达另一侧，明日香看到楼梯时眼中一亮，但随即被愤怒的火焰所取代，因为她看到几个身影缓缓走上楼梯。  
This time though, they weren't clones of Shinji. A clone of _herself_ was slowly walking towards her, alongside a few Rei clones as well. All of whom had the same terrifying smile and glowing red eyes.  
然而这一次，他们不再是真嗣的克隆体。一个自己的克隆体正缓缓向她走来，旁边还有几个绫波的克隆体。他们全都带着同样的恐怖微笑和闪着红光的眼睛。

"As if I needed any _MORE_ clones of me!" Asuka snarled, pulling out her pistol and landing headshots on every clone she saw. Seeing herself get shot in the head was a weird and existential feeling if there ever was one, but seeing the core clones evaporate into a red mist was enough to bring her imagination under control.  
"好像我还需要更多的克隆体似的！" 明日香咆哮着，拔出手枪，对每一个她看到的克隆体进行爆头射击。看到自己被爆头是一种奇怪且存在主义的感觉，但看到核心克隆体化为红色雾气消散，足以让她的想象力得到控制。

Thankfully, there hadn't been as many clones on this side, so they still had a chance to make it downstairs.  
幸运的是，这一侧的克隆体没有那么多，所以他们仍有下楼的机会。

"Guys we have to-…" Asuka spotted Shinji and Rei staring at one of the corkboards on the wall of the school corridor. They both looked terrified.  
"大家我们必须-…" 明日香发现真嗣和绫波盯着学校走廊墙上的一块软木板。他们俩看起来都吓坏了。

"Are you seriously doing this right now!? We have to move-…!" She spotted it. Her brain was refusing to process the demand though. The cogs in her brain had jammed, to the point where she could almost visualize the sparks trying to force them to move.  
“你现在是认真的吗？！我们得走了——！”她看到了那一幕。她的脑子却拒绝处理这个信息。她的大脑齿轮仿佛卡住了，以至于她几乎能想象到那些试图迫使它们转动的火花。

On the wall, pinned on the corkboard, was around twenty or so photos. All of Asuka. All of which could be politely described as indecent.  
在墙上，钉在软木板上，大约有二十来张照片。全都是关于明日香的。所有这些照片都可以礼貌地形容为不雅。

_Changing in the school locker room. Lying in her panties and shirt at home. Several of her on the toilet, panties by her ankles. A shot from behind with her holding a towel to her front, her bare behind on display.  
在学校更衣室里换衣服。穿着内裤和衬衫在家躺着。几张她在厕所里的照片，内裤褪到脚踝。一张从背后拍摄的照片，她手里拿着一条毛巾遮住前方，裸露的臀部暴露无遗。_

Various other pictures that appeared to be taken from a distance, as though with a telescopic camera. Plastered all over the wall.  
其他各种照片，似乎是从远处用望远镜头相机拍摄的。贴满了整面墙。  
Unable to process it, she walked numbly into their classroom, ready to plonk her head onto her desk and call it a day.  
她无法理解这一切，木然地走进教室，准备把头埋在桌上，就此结束这一天。

Her fate would have other plans. Walking into the classroom, she saw more of the same. Photos the size of posters everywhere. Stuck to the chalkboard, falling out of every desk in the room, in student planners, bags, bento boxes.  
但命运另有安排。走进教室，她看到的仍是同样的景象。到处都是海报大小的照片。贴在黑板上，从每张桌子里掉出来，在学生计划本里，书包里，便当盒里。  
It was like a printing press of some dirty voyeur magazine had decided to set up home in their classroom.  
这就像某个色情偷窥杂志的印刷厂决定在他们教室安家落户一样。

Shinji and Rei had tentatively followed Asuka into their classroom. Asuka didn't even have the energy to shout at them not to look. Her eyes simply rolled into the back of her head and she collapsed where she stood.  
真嗣和丽小心翼翼地跟着明日香走进教室。明日香连斥责他们不要看的力气都没有了。她的眼睛只是翻到了后脑勺，随即就站在原地昏倒了。

"ASUKA!" “明日香！”

Holding the limp girl in his arms, he checked for injuries. It appeared she'd fainted from the shock. Thankfully that meant nothing had physically knocked her out but now they were down to just Rei and Shinji. Versus a whole horde of clones.  
他抱着瘫软的女孩，检查她的伤势。看来她是因惊吓过度而昏厥。幸好这意味着她并未受到实质性伤害，但现在只剩下丽和真嗣两人。面对一群克隆人大军。

"Guys, we could really use your help right now!" Shinji yelled towards the heavens.  
“伙计们，我们现在真的需要你们的帮助！”真嗣对着天空大喊。

---

The command centre had suffered a lot of drama already, but what they were seeing on the monitors was catastrophic. Shinji and Rei had summoned anything they could to prop the doors and windows. The toll of using their bracelets was noticeable. One of the tech nerds had likened it to using too much mana in a video game. And now the two teenagers were running on fumes.  
指挥中心已经经历了许多风波，但监控屏幕上显示的景象却是灾难性的。真嗣和丽用尽一切能找到的东西支撑门窗。使用手环的代价显而易见，一位技术宅曾比喻这就像在电子游戏中过度消耗法力。如今，这两个少年已是强弩之末。

Yui watched opened mouth in horror as several of the clones began firing through the gaps in the defences, laser beams flying from outstretched palms. Several beams caught Rei, striking her head and suit. Her entire top half had melted away. But Shinji didn't have the spare thought capacity for boobs right now. The impact to her head had caused her to faint, and suddenly vanish out of existence. The same had happened with Asuka.  
优看着目瞪口呆，惊恐万分，因为几个克隆体开始从防御的缝隙中开火，激光束从伸出的手掌中飞射而出。几束激光击中了丽，打中了她的头部和装甲服。她的上半身已经融化殆尽。但真嗣此刻无暇顾及胸部的问题。头部受到的冲击让她昏迷过去，随即突然消失，不复存在。同样的情形也发生在明日香身上。

"REI! ASUKA!" “丽！明日香！”

"_Shinji, we've pulled them both out of the VR environment. They're alive but you have to think of some way to stop them!"_  
“真嗣，我们已经把她们俩从虚拟现实环境中救出来了。她们还活着，但你得想办法阻止他们！”

Misato's words only gave Shinji the barest hint of reassurance. What was he going to do!? He had failed them both, and he was the weakest fighter out of the three by his own admission. He was panicking and the defences were not going to hold much longer.  
美里的话只给了真嗣一丝微弱的安慰。他该怎么办！？他辜负了他们俩，而且他自己也承认，他是三人中最弱的战士。他惊慌失措，防御也撑不了多久了。

The pulse in his ears was starting to drown out the chaos. His thoughts were rapidly looking across his entire lifespan for anything that might help him right now. Suddenly, his thoughts focused in on a memory, from a long time ago.  
耳中的脉搏声开始淹没周围的混乱。他的思绪迅速掠过他的一生，寻找任何可能帮助他此刻的东西。突然，他的思绪聚焦在一个久远的记忆上。

_~I want you to be the pilot~  
~我希望你成为驾驶员~_

_Would it work? Did he have enough strength? He didn't really have much of a choice right now. It was do or die!  
这会奏效吗？他有足够的力量吗？他现在真的没有太多选择。这是生死攸关的时刻！_

_Thank you… Mana… 谢谢你……Mana……_

"I'm… the pilot…" Shinji whispered. His entire form began to glow with a golden light.  
“我……是驾驶员……” 真嗣低声说道。他的整个身体开始散发出金色的光芒。

"_Misato! What's happening to him?"_ Yui was yelling down the comms from the command centre.  
“美里！他怎么了？” 由依在指挥中心的通讯器里大喊。

"I have no idea…" Misato breathed, unable to take her eyes away from the monitors. "Shinji…?"  
“我不知道……” 美里喘息着，目光无法从监视器上移开。“真嗣……？”

Shinji's form was almost blinding. That hadn't stopped the clones from firing, but it appeared none of the laser beams were able to touch him anymore. A forcefield had appeared in front of the boy, shielding him.  
真嗣的身影几乎耀眼得让人无法直视。克隆体们并未因此停止射击，但似乎所有的激光束都无法再触及他。一个力场出现在男孩面前，保护着他。

"IS THAT AN A.T. FIELD!?" Crimson was staring at the monitors too, dumbfounded. Was it possible? In this world too!?  
"那是 AT 力场吗！？" 绯红也盯着监视器，目瞪口呆。这可能吗？在这个世界也存在！？

Her words were cut short by the roar that bellowed from the monitors in the VR environment.  
她的话被从 VR 环境中的监视器里传来的咆哮声打断了。

"I AM SHINJI IKARI, PILOT OF EVANGELION UNIT 01!"  
"我是碇真嗣，EVA 初号机的驾驶员！"

A deafening explosion rocked the school. Smoke and debris mushroomed from the devastation, blinding everyone at the command centre.  
一声震耳欲聋的爆炸震撼了学校。浓烟和碎片如蘑菇云般从废墟中升腾而起，让指挥中心的每个人都陷入了失明状态。

"We need a visual, anything, please!" Yui was staring at the monitor, her heart caught in her throat. She felt just like she had when she discovered the earthquake all those years ago. The day she almost lost her little boy. Terrified couldn't begin to do justice to the roller coaster of emotions she was experiencing right now. Her husband had stood from his desk, a look of shock and bewilderment filling his face.  
“我们需要画面，任何画面，请！” 结衣紧盯着监视器，心如悬旌。她感觉就像多年前发现地震的那一刻，那天她差点失去了她的小儿子。恐惧这个词远不足以形容她此刻经历的情绪过山车。她的丈夫从桌前站起，脸上满是震惊和困惑。

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

The smoke began to descend and fade from view. A monstrous shadow began to form. Flashes of purple and green began to make themselves seen through the clouds of dust.  
烟雾开始下沉并逐渐消失在视野中。一个巨大的阴影开始显现。紫绿相间的闪光开始在尘埃云中变得清晰可见。

Crimson looked up at the beast she had fought alongside for what felt like years, before it tore her world to shreds. Her whole body was shaking, as though electrified. Her mind wasn't believing what she was seeing. This world wasn't supposed to have them!  
深红抬头望着那头与她并肩作战多年、最终将她的世界撕成碎片的巨兽。她的全身颤抖不已，仿佛被电击一般。她的心智无法相信眼前所见。这个世界本不该有它们的存在！

"Evan…gelion… Unit…01…" She whispered out loud.  
“福音战士……初号机……”她低声自语。

---

The bestial form of a huge, robotic monster towered on what was once the school playing field. It made Misato think of a transformer with a purple and green paintjob. A terrifying transformer with angry looking teeth and eyes and a roar that could shatter every window for miles around.  
一只巨大的机器人怪兽，其野兽般的形态矗立在曾是学校操场的地方。这让美里想起了涂着紫绿两色漆的变形金刚。一个面目狰狞的变形金刚，拥有愤怒的眼神和利齿，咆哮声足以震碎方圆数英里内的每一扇窗户。

"What the hell is that!?"  
"那到底是什么鬼东西！？"

She could only watch as an army of clones piled out of the school. All of whom took a moment to stand stock still and stare up at the giant robot. All grinning maniacally.  
她只能眼睁睁地看着一群克隆人大军从学校里涌出，所有人都停顿了一下，僵立原地，抬头凝视着那巨大的机器人，个个都疯狂地咧嘴笑着。

"_We've been waiting for you… Shinji Ikari."_  
"我们一直在等你……碇真嗣。"

A chorus of creepy voices echoed from the crowd of clones in unison. It was like watching a bizarre horror movie. Misato could almost laugh at the silliness of it all if it wasn't such a dire situation.  
一群诡异的声音从克隆人群中齐声回荡。这就像在看一部离奇的恐怖电影。如果不是这么危急的情况，美里几乎要笑出声来，觉得这一切太荒谬了。

"What's the plan Shinji… What are you gonna do?" Misato stared at the giant monster glaring down on the clones. He needed to figure out his plan, fast!  
“真嗣，你有什么计划…你打算怎么做？”美里盯着那只巨型怪物，它正凶狠地俯视着克隆人。他必须尽快想出计划！

---

He had found himself inside a cockpit of sorts. He was sat in a chair that seemed to stretch down a long tube, with controls by his hands. He'd never controlled anything in his life before, outside of video games. He had certainly never played a game that needed controlling with what looked to be two sliding joysticks. Grabbing them, he decided to at least try moving the thing first.  
他发现自己身处某种驾驶舱内。他坐在一把似乎延伸进长管的椅子上，手边有控制装置。他这辈子除了电子游戏外，从未操控过任何东西。当然，他也从未玩过需要用两个滑动操纵杆来控制的游戏。他决定先抓住操纵杆，至少试着移动一下这个东西。

"Okay, here goes… WHAAAA-…!"  
"好了，开始了……哇啊啊-…！"

The entire command centre watched in horror as the giant robot took one tentative step forward, before slipping and collapsing onto the ground. It had been like watching a lamb take its first steps and falling over, except a whole lot less cute.  
整个指挥中心的人都惊恐地看着那台巨型机器人小心翼翼地向前迈了一步，然后滑倒并摔在地上。这情景就像看着一只小羊羔第一次走路就摔倒了，只不过没那么可爱。

"He doesn't… Oh gods…! He doesn't know how to…" Crimson breathed. Kyoko looked at her daughter anxiously.  
"他不知道……哦，天哪……！他不知道怎么……"" 克里姆森喘着气说。京子焦急地看着她的女儿。

"What? What doesn't he know?"  
"什么？他不知道什么？"

"He has no idea how to pilot it!" Crimson was on the verge of having another mental outburst, before an idea suddenly popped into her head. It wasn't an idea she was crazy about, but if she didn't do this, there wouldn't be much of a future left for any of them.  
"他根本不知道怎么驾驶它！"" 绯红差点又要情绪爆发，但一个念头突然闪过她的脑海。这不是她喜欢的想法，但如果她不这么做，他们就没有多少未来可言了。

"M-mom?" "妈——妈？"

Kyoko Soryu squeaked in surprise. She never thought the day would come that Crimson would refer to her like that. Deciding that the situation needed more focus than thinking about how cute her daughter sounded, she nodded in response.  
空条承太郎惊讶地叫了一声。她从未想过有一天绯红会这样称呼她。她决定，比起思考女儿那可爱的声音，当前的情况更需要集中注意力，于是她点头回应。

"Yes?" “是？”

"Are there anymore plug suits around I could use?"  
“还有其他插入栓服我可以使用吗？”

---

Shinji was hurt. Falling and hitting the ground had felt like as though it had been him who had fallen over. He didn't understand why it happened, but he was going to have serious talks with his parents about how they designed their VR experiments in the future.  
真嗣感到疼痛。跌倒并撞击地面，那种感觉仿佛是他自己摔倒了一样。他不明白为什么会发生这种事，但他打算和父母严肃讨论一下他们未来在虚拟现实实验设计上的问题。

Managing to get the beast back up on its feet, he was beginning to realise that he could get it to walk through a combination of the controls and his own will. It was still clunky and he was having a hard time getting used to it, especially with the damn clones swarming all over him like rabid ants!  
好不容易让那头野兽重新站了起来，他开始意识到可以通过控制装置和自己的意志让它行走。尽管仍然笨拙，他很难适应，尤其是那些该死的克隆体像狂暴的蚂蚁一样蜂拥而至！

He was managing to shake them off, but he could feel pinpricks of pain all over his body, as though the clones were trying to tear off the armour cladding the giant robot.  
他勉强能甩开它们，但全身都能感受到针刺般的疼痛，仿佛那些克隆体正试图撕裂巨型机器人身上的装甲。

Stamping on them didn't seem to be doing much. For all the destroyed clones, another hundred appeared to take their place. If he could find a source for where they were coming from, he might be able to destroy that, but he had his hands full trying to keep himself upright.  
踩踏它们似乎效果不大。尽管摧毁了一批克隆体，又有上百个出现来填补空缺。如果能找到它们来源的地方，他或许能摧毁那个源头，但他现在正忙于保持自己不倒下。

"HEY BAKA! OVER HERE!" "嘿，笨蛋！这边！"

All of the clones and Shinji turned around. What they saw was Asuka, dressed in her bright red plug suit, grinning evilly.  
所有的克隆体和真嗣都转过身来。他们看到的是明日香，身穿她那鲜红色的插入栓服，邪恶地笑着。

"Asuka!? You're okay!?" "明日香！？你没事吧！？"

"No you idiot." The girl's smile continued as she began to glow with a radiant light, just like Shinji had before.  
"不，你这个白痴。" 女孩的笑容依旧，随着她开始散发出耀眼的光芒，就像真嗣之前那样。

"I told you." Another explosion rocked the school field. Shinji's mouth felt like it dropped to the floor as he saw what was being revealed by the dissipating smoke.  
"我告诉过你了。" 又一次爆炸震撼了学校操场。真嗣的嘴巴张得大大的，仿佛要掉到地上，因为他看到了烟雾散去后显露出来的东西。

A red version of his robot was standing in front of him. It had many green eyes, scary teeth and a terrifying aura. Reminding him heavily of someone else he knew. The emerald eyes all focused on him. It looked like even the robot was grinning at him.  
一个红色版本的机器人站在他面前，拥有许多绿色的眼睛，吓人的牙齿和一个恐怖的气场。这让他不由自主地想起了他认识的某个人。那些翡翠般的眼睛全都聚焦在他身上，仿佛连机器人都在对他咧嘴笑。

"Call me…" “叫我……”

_Crimson. “深红。”_

---

Misato _really_ needed a beer right about now. Another scary looking robot, Crimson demanding to get into the simulation, somehow able to get authorisation to use a bracelet which had almost too conveniently been ready for her.  
美里现在真的很想来杯啤酒。又是一台看起来吓人的机器人，克莱姆红要求进入模拟，不知怎么地竟然能获得授权使用一个几乎太方便就准备好的手环。

"Almost as if they were planning to have Crimson cooperate with them eventually, eh?" Ryoji Kaji had joined her in the VR's control centre. His normally smiling visage was lost in thought, looking at the monitors.  
“简直就像他们早就计划好要让克莱姆红最终与他们合作一样，是吧？” 碇キョウジ已经加入了她在 VR 控制中心的行列。他平时总是带着笑容的脸庞此刻陷入了沉思，目光盯着监视器。

"I wonder what would have happened if Crimson had refused to work with the lab? Kept that bracelet as a spare?"  
“我在想，如果克莱姆红拒绝与实验室合作，把那个手环当作备用会怎样？”

"I doubt Gendo would try to force her into doing anything, judging from that speech earlier. Yui wouldn't have allowed him to do so anyway."  
"我怀疑源堂会试图强迫她做任何事，从他之前的演讲来看。即使他想，绫波也不会允许他这么做。"

"I'm just surprised Crimson is doing this at all! You heard what she said about that world she came from. I would never have come near one of those creepy robots again if I'd been through what she had." Misato was racking her brains trying to think about what changed the young girls mind. "It's gotta be…"  
"我只是惊讶绫波居然会这么做！你听她说过她来自的那个世界。如果我经历了她所经历的，我绝不会再靠近那些可怕的机器人。真嗣，她在想什么？"" 美里绞尽脑汁试图理解这位年轻女孩的转变。""一定是……"

"Shinji." “真嗣。”

---

"It feels… just like my original one did."  
"感觉……就像我原来的那个一样。"

Crimson found herself once again behind the wheels of EVA Unit 02. Stretching out her arm, she found her EVA's arm did the same, flawlessly.  
绯红发现自己又一次坐在了 EVA 二号机的驾驶舱内。她伸展手臂，发现 EVA 的手臂也同步做出了同样的动作，完美无瑕。

"Okay, at least I can control this thing." She looked around at the various diagnostics around her. "Huh, that's different."  
“好吧，至少我能控制这东西。”她环顾四周的各种诊断数据。“咦，这有点不一样。”

Normally in an EVA, she had an entire tech crew monitoring the Entry Plug's diagnostics, as well as readouts all around her displaying battery life, life support system status and other technobabble.  
通常在驾驶 EVA 时，她会有一整个技术团队监控插入栓的诊断数据，以及环绕在她周围的各种显示屏，显示电池寿命、生命维持系统状态和其他技术术语。  
The graphs were all there but the only way she could describe them was _freaking out._  
图表全都在那儿，但她唯一能形容它们的方式就是抓狂。

Her battery life flickered through numbers so fast that it made her think of a Nixie tube clock on crack. Everything else was reading out about the same. Sod the numbers, she'd have this wrapped up in a few minutes anyway.  
她的电池寿命数字闪烁得如此之快，让她想起了嗑药的数码管时钟。其他一切读数也大致相同。去他的数字，反正她几分钟内就能搞定。

"Oh shit, do I have any weapons?"  
“哦该死，我有武器吗？”

No rifles and no weapon buildings to get them from.  
没有步枪，也没有武器建筑可供获取。

"How about… YES!" Her shoulder pauldrons! The right shoulder opened to reveal one of her favourite toys, the Progressive Knife!  
“不如…好极了！”她的肩甲！右肩甲打开，露出了她最爱的玩具之一，那把渐进式匕首！

Pulling it out, she felt the familiar blade start to hum with high frequency vibrations. At least she had something! It looked like she was going to need it too.  
拔出匕首，她感受到熟悉的刀刃开始发出高频振动的嗡鸣。至少她还有这个！看起来她真的会需要它。

The crowd of clones had been acting strangely for a while. Individual clones were appearing to meld with each other, almost like the reverse of a cell dividing. The process was rapidly speeding up to.  
克隆人群已经有一阵子表现得异常了。个别克隆体开始融合在一起，几乎像是细胞分裂的反过程。这一进程正在迅速加速。

"_Asu-… I mean, Crimson, can you hear me?"_  
“Asu……我是说，Crimson，你能听到我吗？”

So they still had inter-Eva comms apparently.  
看来他们仍然保持着 Eva 之间的通讯。

"Yes, baka. Now let me show you how a real pilot controls an EVA!"  
"没错，笨蛋。现在让我展示给你看，真正的驾驶员是如何操控 EVA 的！"

Slamming her knife down, she aimed for the areas where the clones merging was starting to get noticeably big. The field and the school noticeably shook, as though an earthquake had ripped through the area.  
她猛地将刀插下，瞄准了克隆体开始明显融合的区域。整个场地和学校明显震动，仿佛一场地震横扫了这片区域。

Crimson's knife wasn't having much of an effect. The clones had begun melding around her blade, rapidly conglomerating before the eyes of the two pilots.  
Crimson 的刀效果甚微。克隆体已经开始围绕她的刀刃融合，迅速地在两位驾驶员眼前聚集成形。

"Shit, it's happening too fast!"  
"该死，这一切发生得太快了！"

"_Crimson, what do we do?"_  
"深红，我们该怎么办？"

It didn't take long before all the clones had merged into something big. A colossus, standing about as tall as the Evas. Another being that Crimson was only too familiar with. Her heart almost stopped just looking at it.  
没过多久，所有的克隆体就融合成了一个巨大的存在。一个巨人，身高几乎与 Eva 相当。对于深红来说，这个存在她再熟悉不过了。仅仅是看着它，她的心跳几乎都要停止了。

"IS THAT A FUCKING ANGEL!?"  
"那他妈的是个天使吗！？"

She had never actually seen this Angel before. However, she recognised its look from watching previous battle records. Before Crimson had made her way to Tokyo-3, her world's Shinji Ikari had fought the third Angel, beating it but just barely. Mostly because the dumb thing had decided to self-destruct. Looking at what was in front of her, it looked awfully similar.  
她从未亲眼见过这个天使。然而，她从之前的战斗录像中认出了它的模样。在克莱曼婷来到东京-3 之前，她所在世界的碇真嗣曾与第三使徒萨基尔交战，虽然最终取胜但也仅是险胜。多半是因为那蠢东西选择了自爆。看着眼前的东西，它看起来极其相似。

"That can't be… Sachiel?!" She breathed. It looked just like what she had seen before. It had the aura of an Angel, but not quite. It felt… artificial? Like it wasn't real. Like it was more some sort of bizarre automaton.  
"不可能……萨基尔？！" 她喘息道。它看起来和她之前见过的如出一辙。它有着使徒的气息，但又不太像。感觉……人造的？仿佛它并非真实存在，更像某种奇异的自动机械。  
But if it was real, or at least, very similar, the weaknesses should be the same, right?  
但如果那是真实的，或者至少非常相似，那么弱点应该是一样的，对吧？

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

He jumped, hearing Crimson suddenly bark over the airwaves.  
他吓了一跳，听到 Crimson 突然在无线电中大声喊道。

"Y-yes?" “是-是的？”

"I've fought these things before, in my world. I'm not sure if that's _exactly_ the same thing, but it looks close enough, which means I know how to beat it."  
"我在我的世界里对付过这些东西。虽然不确定是不是完全一样，但看起来足够接近，这意味着我知道怎么打败它。"

"You do!?" "你真的会！？"

"Watch and learn!" "看着学吧！"

Unit 02 broke into a sprint, heading straight for the monstrosity. Crimson's progressive knife was ready, aiming at the sparkling red core she had destroyed countless times before. She was seemingly meters away from her target, her aim true.  
02 号机突然加速，直奔那怪物而去。Crimson 手中的渐进之刃已准备就绪，瞄准了那闪烁着红光的核，她曾无数次将其摧毁。她看似离目标仅几米之遥，瞄准精准无误。

A rush suddenly erupted from the ground beneath her. She had expected some form of resistance, but instead of an A.T. field like she spotted earlier, a rush of melded clones had formed a wall between her and the Angel. It was like a wall of half-formed humans, arms and legs sticking out at weird angles, heads were popping out… It was another thing that made everyone watching think of cheap horror movies.  
突然间，她脚下的地面爆发出一股力量。她本以为会遇到某种形式的抵抗，但出乎意料的是，没有像之前看到的那种 A.T.力场，取而代之的是一堵由融合克隆体组成的墙，横亘在她与使徒之间。这堵墙像是半成型的人类，四肢以怪异的角度伸出，头颅不断冒出……这景象让所有旁观者不禁联想到廉价的恐怖电影。

"_I don't want to rush whatever it is you guys are trying to do, but the MAGI are 98% infected. Hurry!"_  
“我不想催促你们正在做的事，但 MAGI 系统已有 98%被感染。快点！”

Misato's cry pushed Shinji to act. There wasn't much he _could_ do; he could barely control his… Eva. But after glancing over at Unit 02, he caught the eyes of Crimson on the communication monitors. They both nodded at each other, understanding what needed to be done.  
美里的一声呼喊促使真嗣行动起来。他能做的并不多；他几乎无法控制自己的……Eva。但当他瞥向 02 号机时，通讯监视器上那双深红色的眼睛吸引了他的注意。两人相互点头，明白了需要做什么。

Unit 01 clumsily started to run. From Crimson's perspective, it was like watching a toddler running towards a toy. She almost laughed at the comicalness of it all, but she needed to keep her focus sharp. She'd only have one chance at this.  
01 号机笨拙地开始奔跑。从深红的角度看，这就像是在看一个蹒跚学步的孩子冲向玩具。她几乎要被这滑稽的一幕逗笑了，但她必须保持专注。她只有一次机会。  
Unit 01 finally reached the wall, where, instead of stopping, Shinji decided to barrel through it, ripping the wall apart and exposing the core once again.  
01 号机终于到达了墙边，真嗣没有选择停下，而是决定直接冲破它，撕裂墙壁，再次暴露出核心。

Without thinking, Crimson willed Unit 02 to dive forward, not allowing anything else to come between her, her knife and the sparkly jewel that needed to shatter, right now.  
未加思索，Crimson 便命令 02 号单位向前俯冲，不容任何事物阻挡在她、她的刀刃与那急需粉碎的闪亮宝石之间，就在此刻。

A crack ripped through the air, followed by a deafening crashing noise.  
空气中撕裂出一道裂缝，紧接着是震耳欲聋的轰鸣声。

An explosion ripped through the world, followed by darkness.  
一场爆炸席卷了整个世界，随后陷入黑暗。

"So."

Gendo Ikari was once again sitting behind his desk. In front of him were various documents. Reports, on how SEELE had managed to infiltrate their networks and cause untold catastrophe for the past eighteen hours.  
碇源堂再次坐在他的办公桌后。面前摆着各种文件。报告，关于 Seele 如何成功渗透他们的网络并在过去十八小时内造成无法估量的灾难。

Yui Ikari was standing next to him, facepalming at the sheer stupidity of it all. She didn't have much to say to the crowd of tech crew, scientists, the kids, along with Misato and Kaji. Gendo began to clear his throat, wondering how to deal with the cretins he called comrades.  
碇唯站在他旁边，对这一切的愚蠢程度捂脸。她对技术团队、科学家、孩子们，以及美里和加持无话可说。碇源堂开始清嗓子，思考如何对付这些他称之为同志的蠢货。

"It appears, from initial reports… That we were hacked. Quite magnificently, as you can imagine, by SEELE. You would think that it might have taken them a long time, lots of effort and patience but the truth is…"  
“根据初步报告……我们被黑了。想象一下，非常精彩地，被 Seele。你们可能会认为这需要他们很长时间，大量的努力和耐心，但事实是……”

Gendo sighed. He was considering whether this was more excruciating than _losing_ to those idiotic men at the cult cabal.  
源度叹了口气。他在考虑这是否比输给那些邪教密会里的白痴们更令人痛苦。

"Someone had used the MAGI system to check social media, and not via network safety protocols. For the sake of everyone here, no names will be mentioned but the warnings about using the Internet here were for a reason. As a result, there is a huge amount of system damage done that is going to take _months_ to repair." Gendo turned his gaze towards the desk. He kept sighing to himself, feeling himself get older with every breath.  
“有人利用 MAGI 系统检查社交媒体，而且不是通过网络安全协议。为了大家的利益，这里不会提及具体名字，但关于在此使用互联网的警告是有原因的。结果造成了大量系统损坏，修复这些损害需要数月时间。”源度将目光转向办公桌。他不停地叹息，每呼吸一次都感觉自己又老了一分。

"Why SEELE decided to use this method to insert a virus, we're not sure. Why or how it took on the forms that it did is also unknown. It's a small miracle Crimson was here to not only help us defeat the target, but to also have data that might help us in the future." Yui Ikari had taken over, giving the uncomfortable Crimson a thankful wink in the process. "Not to mention Shinji, Asuka and Rei for fighting valiantly for the defence of this facility."  
“我们不确定 Seele 为何决定采用这种方式植入病毒，也不清楚它为何以及如何呈现出这些形态。能在这里有 Crimson 不仅帮助我们击败目标，还拥有可能对未来有帮助的数据，这真是个小奇迹。”碇唯接过话头，向不自在的 Crimson 投去感激的一瞥。“更不用说真嗣、明日香和绫波为保卫这个设施而英勇奋战了。”

The three teenagers shuffled awkwardly while receiving a round of applause. Sure, they all fought but they also got their butts kicked. It was humiliating, even though they technically won.  
三个青少年在一片掌声中尴尬地挪动着脚步。没错，他们确实战斗了，但也挨了不少揍。这很丢脸，尽管从技术上讲他们赢了。

"Can I just ask…?" Asuka raised her hand. "The… pictures. What was… that about?"  
“我可以问一下…吗？”明日香举起手。“那些…照片。是怎么回事？”

Everyone in the command centre had _just_ managed to forget about all the indecent images of Asuka flashing up in the VR room. Unaware of the discomfort she had just caused, Asuka continued her barrage of awkward questions.  
指挥中心里的每个人都刚刚设法忘记了在 VR 室里闪现的明日香的不雅图像。不知自己刚造成了不适，明日香继续连珠炮似地提出尴尬的问题。

"Why just me? Why stuff like… that? And who on earth took them!?"  
“为什么只针对我？为什么是那种……东西？还有，到底是谁拿走了它们？！”

"As for the who, we don't know." Yui attempted to answer the understandably distressed girl. "However…" She gestured weakly to Shinji, who almost begged his mother with his eyes to not answer the question.  
“至于是谁，我们还不清楚。”Yui 试图回答这个完全可以理解的焦虑女孩。“不过……”她无力地向 Shinji 示意，后者几乎用眼神恳求母亲不要回答这个问题。

Realising there was no stopping the crazy train just yet, Shinji pulled out his phone.  
意识到疯狂的列车还停不下来，Shinji 掏出了他的手机。

"Have you checked _your_ socials today Asuka? I think… _you're_ the one that might've been hacked…"  
"今天你检查过社交账号了吗，明日香？我觉得……可能是你被黑了……"

There was a return of the arctic freeze in the command centre as Asuka stood stock still.  
指挥中心再次陷入了北极般的冰冷氛围，明日香僵立不动。

"No…"

She slowly pulled out her phone, which she had neglected to look at since she had left school. There were dozens of notifications on the lock screen. Some of them, even with their short headers, had sentences that looked like warnings from her friends.  
她缓缓掏出手机，自从离开学校后就没再查看过。锁屏上有数十条通知。其中一些，即便只有简短的标题，也像是来自朋友的警告。

"_You might want to check your timelines! I think you've been hacked!"_  
“你最好检查一下你的时间线！我觉得你被黑了！”

A message from Hikari only further brought on the dread as she opened LINE and her other social media applications. All of the lewd photography was there, just like she had seen in the VR world.  
来自光的一条消息更是加剧了她的恐惧，当她打开 LINE 和其他社交媒体应用时，那些猥亵的照片赫然在目，正如她在 VR 世界中所见。

"W-why…?" "为…为什么…？"

Just like she had done in the VR world, Asuka collapsed onto the ground, unconscious.  
就像她在 VR 世界中所做的那样，明日香倒在地上，失去了意识。

"ASUKA!" Shinji ran to the second-time collapsed teenager.  
"明日香！" 真嗣跑向再次倒下的少女。

"But really though, why her?" Misato looked thoughtfully. "And if the hack was today, _how_ could it have been Asuka? She was at school all day, the attack had already started before we even got here?"  
"但说真的，为什么是她？" 美里若有所思地看着。"而且如果黑客行为是今天发生的，怎么可能是明日香？她一整天都在学校，攻击在我们到达这里之前就已经开始了。"

"It obviously happened on a different day she was here. Probably a virus lying dormant until certain triggers went off…" Crimson said in a low voice, glaring daggers at her counterpart. "I can't believe she'd be someone to flaunt herself like that."  
"显然是她在别的时候在这里发生的。可能是一种病毒潜伏着，直到某些触发条件被激活……" 克莱姆森低声说道，目光如刀般瞪着对方。"我真不敢相信她会那样炫耀自己。"

"She isn't like that! My Asuka would never do such a thing!" Kyoko glared at Crimson, coming to one of her daughter's defence. "Why would you think she'd do anything like that? It's clear that someone has been spying on her for a while now. But why would they pick her as a target?"  
"她不是那样的！我的明日香绝不会做这种事！" 京子瞪着克莱姆森，为她的女儿辩护。"你为什么会认为她会做那样的事？很明显，有人已经监视她一段时间了。但为什么会选择她作为目标？"

Crimson looked nervously away from Kyoko, feeling for the first time since arriving in this world, an overwhelming sense of anxiety and fear. There was something about being in the presence of her mother that stripped away all her anger, replacing it with a constrictive knot in her chest that made it difficult to talk. She felt like a child caught stealing cookies and instead of reacting how she normally would with out-of-control rage, she caught herself staring at her shoes.  
深红紧张地避开京子的目光，自从来到这个世界后，她第一次感受到了难以承受的焦虑和恐惧。在母亲面前，她所有的愤怒都消失了，取而代之的是胸口紧缩的结，让她难以开口。她觉得自己像个偷吃饼干被抓的孩子，本该像平时那样爆发失控的怒火，现在却只是盯着鞋子发呆。

"I-I believe the hackers might have been… attempting s-something like a penetration t-test? And Asu… She would-… w-work well as a target b-because of her links to the… lab and her… popularity… She'd be a… good… catalyst…" Crimson couldn't believe it. _She_ was stammering. Her! Sounding for all the world like a shy bookworm, she sounded like one of the Rei's for God's sake!  
“我-我认为黑客可能是在……尝试进行某种渗透测试？而……阿苏……她会……很适合作为目标，因为她和……实验室的联系以及她的……知名度……她会是……一个很好的……催化剂……”深红简直不敢相信，她在结巴。她！听起来完全像个害羞的书呆子，简直像是那些玲的翻版，天哪！

Kyoko instantly realized why Crimson was reacting like this. She was the spitting image of the poor girl's mother in Crimson's past world, and she was demanding answers. Though she might not have meant it, Kyoko probably appeared intimidating and that was the last thing she wanted to do.  
京子立刻意识到深红为何如此反应。她与深红过去世界中的母亲如出一辙，而她现在正要求答案。尽管她可能并非有意，京子大概显得很吓人，而这正是她最不想做的。

"Oh dear…" Stumbling over to the stricken girl, Kyoko enveloped her in a tight embrace, causing even more emotional confusion on Crimson, although she didn't altogether dislike it. Gendo sighed, adjusting his glasses as he began to address everyone once again.  
"哦，天哪…" 踉跄着走向受伤的女孩，绫子紧紧地抱住了她，这让绯红心中的情感更加混乱，尽管她并不完全讨厌这种感觉。源渡叹了口气，调整了一下眼镜，再次向大家讲话。

"The young lady is right. SEELE will do anything and everything to disrupt and invade our operations. This has been a lesson for us all."  
"这位年轻女士说得对。SEELE 会不择手段地破坏和入侵我们的行动。这对我们所有人都是一个教训。"

"We'll need to bolster our countermeasures to prevent things like this from happening again in the future." Yui glanced towards the tech team. "And maybe make sure that social media use is blocked on site for the foreseeable future..."  
"我们需要加强我们的反制措施，以防止未来再次发生类似的事情。" 唯看向技术团队。"或许还要确保在可预见的未来，现场禁止使用社交媒体……"

A collective groan echoed throughout the command centre. Breaks times were about to become excruciating. Personnel were going to have to socialize.  
指挥中心内响起了一阵集体的呻吟。休息时间即将变得难以忍受。工作人员们不得不进行社交。

Before he found himself caught in the crossfire of an uprising, Shinji decided to pick Asuka up and carry her towards the medical bay. He figured that she would probably appreciate it more than waking up on the floor of the command centre. Or in his lap.  
在发现自己卷入一场起义的交火之前，真嗣决定抱起明日香，带她前往医疗舱。他觉得她可能会更感激这种方式，而不是醒来时躺在指挥中心的地板上，或者在他的腿上。

---

Asuka suddenly woke up, her eyes finding a cold, bare ceiling above her. She recognized it, seeing as it hadn't been the first time she'd awoken in the medical bay. Blinking her eyes a few times to shake the weariness out of them, she thought back, piecing together the memories of how she got here.  
明日香突然醒来，她的眼睛发现头顶是一片冰冷、光秃秃的天花板。她认出了这个地方，毕竟这不是她第一次在医疗舱里醒来。眨了几下眼睛，试图驱散疲惫，她开始回想，拼凑起自己如何来到这里的记忆。

"Okay, so we went to the command centre… The revelation that indecent images of me have been hacked out of my phone and flooded on social media was discovered, ah…" She felt a wave of dizziness flood over her. That would do it. Shock on that level would make anyone crumple to the floor.  
“好吧，我们去了指挥中心……发现我的手机里不雅照片被黑客盗取并大量散布到社交媒体上，啊……”她感到一阵眩晕袭来。这足以让人崩溃。那种程度的震惊足以让任何人瘫倒在地。

She suddenly felt her hand twitch. Not by her own power, but from the faintly warm sensation she felt wrapped around it. She marvelled at the fact that she had only just noticed it. Her head really wasn't in the game today. She had a pretty good idea who it was, clutching her hand as if to stop her from floating away.  
她突然感到手微微抽动。不是她自己的力量，而是被一种微暖的感觉包裹着。她惊讶于自己刚刚才注意到这一点。今天她的脑袋确实不在状态。她大致猜到了是谁，紧紧握住她的手，仿佛要阻止她飘走。

Turning her head, Asuka's suspicions were confirmed when she saw a passed-out Shinji, his head resting on one arm, a sliver of drool dribbling out of the corner of his mouth. Bizarrely, she seemed to find it somewhat attractive. A blush flared across her face, followed by indignation. Was there anything else weird about him that she liked?! Was she about to start having strange fantasies about his scent?!  
转过头，当看到昏睡的 Shinji，他的头靠在一只手臂上，嘴角流出一丝口水时，Asuka 的怀疑得到了证实。奇怪的是，她似乎觉得这有点吸引人。她的脸颊泛起红晕，接着是愤怒。他还有其他什么奇怪的地方是她喜欢的吗？！她是不是快要开始对他的气味产生奇怪的幻想了？！

Her body froze. Oh no. She wasn't… Was she? With her internal debate in full rage about why this was/wasn't a good idea, she suddenly found herself inches away from the top of Shinji's head.  
她的身体僵住了。哦不。她不是……她是吗？内心激烈的辩论正全速进行，关于为什么这是个/不是个好主意，她突然发现自己离真嗣的头顶只有几英寸远。

"No no no no no, stop... stopstopstopnononon... **_AHHHHHHHHH!_**" The embarrassed screams in her head were drowned about by the thunderous claps of her heartbeat in her ears. She held her breath, begging with herself not to do anything she might end up regretting later.  
“不不不不不，停下来……停停停不不不不……啊啊啊啊啊啊！”内心的尴尬尖叫被震耳欲聋的心跳声淹没。她屏住呼吸，恳求自己不要做出任何可能后悔的事。

She was already regretting it and she hadn't done anything yet!  
她已经开始后悔了，而她甚至还没做任何事！

Her nose inched further along its half-intended trajectory. She could feel the tips of his hair tickling her nostrils. She was going lightheaded from holding her breath. It was almost as if she wasn't giving herself a choice. She would have to breathe eventually. Yeah, that was it. It wasn't as if she was doing this because she _wanted_ to. Breathing was a necessity! Never mind that she had by now buried her face into Shinji's bird nest he called hair and inhaled deeply, hit by curious notes of chestnuts and other earthy scents.  
她的鼻子沿着半是有意的轨迹缓缓向前。她能感觉到他发梢轻触她的鼻孔。屏息太久，她开始感到头晕目眩。仿佛她别无选择，终究得呼吸。没错，就是这样。并非她出于渴望才这么做。呼吸是必需的！别提她此刻已将脸埋进真嗣那被他称为鸟窝的头发中，深深吸气，被栗子和其他泥土气息的奇异香味击中。

She stayed there, longer than she subconsciously promised herself that she would. It was addictive, her senses being enveloped by Shinji.  
她停留的时间，比潜意识中给自己设定的要长。这种感觉令人上瘾，她的感官被真嗣所包围。

"Would it be the same if he gave me a long hug, I wonder?" She giggled to herself, indulging in her weirdness for just a bit longer. He was still snoring, she was safe for now. She was enjoying herself, for the first time in what felt like forever, she was happy, letting life and her hormones take the wheel. At least it wasn't something even weirder, like lusting over his BO…  
“如果他给我一个长长的拥抱，会不会也是这样呢？”她暗自发笑，沉溺于这份怪异中稍久一些。他仍在打鼾，她暂时安全。她正享受着，仿佛久违的快乐，任由生活和荷尔蒙掌控方向盘。至少这还不算更奇怪的事，比如对他的体味产生欲望……

With that thought snapping her straight back into reality, her heartbeat still beating a million miles an hour, Asuka sat bolt upright, her eyes still transfixed on the sleeping Shinji.  
这个念头猛地将她拉回现实，心跳依旧如百万英里般急速，明日香突然笔直坐起，目光依旧紧锁在熟睡的真嗣身上。

Rapid thoughts involving stealing his clothes at home, from the laundry… Inhaling their scent, losing herself into a lust-filled adventure of self-pleasure invaded her mind. Somewhere under the covers of the hospital bed, she could feel a wetness beginning to dampen where she'd very much rather not think about right now. As much as she tried, she still felt her hand slowly slinking its way under the covers, slipping past the elastic of her undergarments as her breathing slowly turned into panting. Her face felt like a radiator, a small voice in the back of her head was wondering if she was breaking out into a full-blown fever, and _Shinji appeared to be stirring-… !_ _**ABORT MISSION, ABORT-…!**_  
快速闪过的念头涉及在家中偷取他的衣物，从洗衣篮里……吸入它们的气息，迷失在充满欲望的自我愉悦冒险中侵袭她的思绪。在医院床铺的被单下，她能感觉到一种湿润开始浸湿她现在非常不想去想的地方。尽管她尽力尝试，她的手仍慢慢滑向被单下，悄悄越过内衣的松紧带，她的呼吸逐渐转为喘息。她的脸热得像散热器，脑海中有个小声音在想她是否正在发高烧，而真嗣似乎在动……！中止任务，中止……！

"Asuka?" A sleepy voice, adorable as they come, wandered into the stricken girl's eardrums. She tried every trick in the book to banish her thoughts from moments ago. She tried to think of anything that would, in lack of a better phrase, turn her off!  
“明日香？”一个睡意朦胧的声音，可爱至极，传入了受惊女孩的耳膜。她尝试了所有能想到的办法来驱散刚才的念头。她试图想任何能让她，用一个不太恰当的词来说，失去兴趣的事情！

_Old people, a dog peeing on the road, Honekawa-sensei's deadly boring lessons, Misato's cooking, Shinji's SDAT player, Shinji's unwashed boxers lying on top of the washing machine, defenceless and all her's to-ARGHHHH!  
老人家，一只狗在路上撒尿，Honekawa 老师的无聊至极的课，Misato 的烹饪，Shinji 的 SDAT 播放器，Shinji 未洗的内裤躺在洗衣机上，无助且全都是她的——啊啊啊！_

It was a fruitless battle. Realizing now that she had been repressing her urges for a long time, it felt as though a dam had burst. Though not completely.  
这是一场徒劳的战斗。现在她意识到自己已经压抑了很久的冲动，感觉就像大坝决堤了一样。虽然还没有完全崩溃。

Cracks had appeared, spouting out surges of water but the mental sanity department inside her mind was working at insane pace to put the metaphorical band aids on before she lost herself completely.  
裂缝已经出现，喷涌出水流，但她内心的心理理智部门正以疯狂的速度在彻底迷失之前用比喻性的创可贴修补。

"Jesus Asuka! You're bright red! Do you have a fever or something?!" Shinji picked that moment to do the one thing that would demolish her internal Walls of Jericho and gently touched his forehead onto hers, checking her temperature. She internally cursed to all the gods in existence ever.  
“天哪，明日香！你脸红得像番茄！是不是发烧了？”真嗣恰好在那一刻做了唯一能摧毁她内心耶利哥之墙的事，他温柔地将额头贴在她的额头上，检查她的体温。她在心里向所有存在的神明咒骂着。

_**WHY WAS THIS A THING?!  
“为什么这种事会发生？！”**_

_Japanese and their skinship…  
“日本人真是爱肌肤接触啊……”_

At least she knew who to blame for her following action.  
至少她知道该怪谁引发了接下来的举动。

"Asuka, let me go get the nurse! You're burning u-_MMMMMPH_!" Shinji was cut off by a pair of lips finding a home on his own, Asuka's hands firmly around the back of his head. He was a fish out of water, his whole nervous system was electrified. His eyes were wide with shock and his fried brain was sure he was seeing what looked like hearts instead of irises in Asuka's.  
“明日香，我去叫护士来！你烧得厉害——唔唔唔！”真嗣的话被一双唇堵了回去，明日香的手紧紧按在他的后脑勺上。他如同离水的鱼，全身神经都被电击般震撼。他的眼睛因震惊而瞪大，混乱的脑海中确信自己看到明日香的眼中闪烁的不是虹膜，而是心形图案。

He feared for his life. After she inevitably calmed down, Shinji wasn't sure if this was going to continue, or she'd be out for murder.  
他为自己的生命担忧。等她终于平静下来后，真嗣不确定这是否会继续，还是她会转而谋杀他。

Of course, as his fate seemed destined to suffer misfortune of all kinds, the sound of an automatic door pneumatically opened behind him. He didn't need to look around. He felt the eyes staring into the back of his head.  
当然，似乎他的命运注定要遭受各种不幸，自动门在他身后气动开启的声音响起。他无需回头。他能感觉到目光刺入他的后脑。

The whole gang had just walked in.  
整个团伙刚刚走了进来。

_Whew... 6000 words? Can't remember the last time I wrote that much for a chapter.  
呼... 6000 字？不记得上次为了一章写这么多是什么时候了。_

_Angel has become my longest fic on fanfiction, and I'm fairly proud of that. Writing has been helping me emotionally the past few days, and seeing all the characters delving into their development like they have been doing is great!  
《Angel》已成为我在 fanfiction 上篇幅最长的作品，对此我颇为自豪。写作近几日对我的情感有着极大的慰藉，看到所有角色如他们所展现的那样深入发展，真是太棒了！_

_And being able to get two long chapters out over the course of 2/3 days has been very motivating as well.  
而且能在两三天内完成两篇长章节，也极大地激励了我。_

_I will have to slow it down a bit though. Not by much, but the reason these chapters were so long was because it was difficult to break them up without disrupting the flow of the atmosphere. Originally, it was supposed to be one long chapter, but it inflated well beyond what I had originally intended.  
不过，我得稍微放慢节奏。不会太多，但这些章节之所以如此长，是因为很难在不破坏氛围流畅性的情况下将其分割。原本计划是一个长章节，但它的篇幅远远超出了我最初的预期。_

_Not to mention I can't forget about other projects/stories etc.  
更别提我还有其他项目/故事等不能忘。_

_I'm setting up a Ko~Fi for donations and early access to other projects, as well as more concise updates about 'Angel' and other stories. I want to be able to turn what I do into a more regular thing, but I can't do it alone. So I need your help. I would appreciate it so much if you're able to check my profile for links.  
我正在为捐赠和提前访问其他项目，以及关于《天使》和其他故事的更简明更新设置一个 Ko~Fi。我希望能让我的创作变得更加规律，但我一个人做不到。所以我需要你的帮助。如果你能查看我的个人资料链接，我将不胜感激。_

_Have a nice day! 祝你今天愉快！_
