Tokyo-3 was rebuilding. The process was slow, paved with struggle and hardship, but in the wake of Zeruel's attack, the city was healing. People were returning to the surface, businesses were opening again, and everyone seemed to come together under one, unifying purpose. Of course, there were pessimists, but the majority of people seemed uncharacteristically focused on returning to some semblance of normalcy once again.  
第三新东京市正逐步重建。尽管进程缓慢且充满挑战，但在第十四使徒袭击之后，城市正逐渐恢复元气。居民们陆续回到地面，商家重新营业，大家仿佛凝聚在同一个目标下。虽然不乏悲观的声音，但多数人异常专注于恢复往日的生活秩序。

Shinji Ikari had just finished his routine synch-test for the day, and was preparing himself to leave NERV's HQ. As he dressed into his regular clothes, he couldn't contain his excitement for what would happen later that night. He buckled his belt, tucked his shirt into his pants, and checked his phone. No notifications, as usual. He briefly opened the app to whatever gacha game he had a passing interest in that month, collected his crystals, and sighed as he pulled a worthless unit he had already owned.  
碇真嗣刚做完当天的同步测试，正准备离开 NERV 总部。换衣服时，他对晚上即将发生的事情感到异常兴奋。他系好皮带，整理好衬衫，然后看了看手机，依旧没有任何消息。他随手打开那个月在玩的抽卡游戏，领取了水晶，结果又抽到一个已有的无用角色，不禁叹了口气。

Walking into the hallway, he heard a familiar voice calling from behind.  
步入走廊，他听到背后传来熟悉的声音呼唤。

"Idiot Shinji!" 真嗣，你个笨蛋！

Shinji turned around with a smile on his face and was abruptly pulled into the arms of fellow EVA pilot and his new girlfriend, Asuka Langley Sohryu.  
真嗣带着微笑转身，随即被同为 EVA 驾驶员的新女友，惣流·明日香·兰格雷一把拥入怀中。

"H— Hey Asuka. What's this for?" Shinji said as he reluctantly, but assuredly embraced the girl.  
"嘿，明日香，这是怎么回事？" 碇真嗣虽然有些犹豫，但还是坚定地拥抱着女孩。

"We're dating, dummy! I can't just hug you for no reason?"  
我们在交往呢，笨蛋！难道我不能无缘无故地抱你一下吗？

"Well, no, that's not what I mean—"  
不，我指的不是那个——

"Just shut up." 别说了。

Asuka tightened her grip around Shinji's body, pulling him closer. Shinji reciprocated, and Asuka felt at ease. She always did when he held her. In his arms, she could be herself. Not the self she wanted others to see, but the one she repressed. He was the catalyst in tearing down her walls, and together they were learning to love themselves, with themselves.  
明日香紧紧搂住真嗣，将他拉得更近。真嗣也以拥抱回应，让明日香感到安心。每当他这样拥抱她，她总能感到平静。在他的怀抱中，她能展现真实的自我，而非她希望别人看到的那一面。真嗣是打破她心防的关键，两人正一起学习如何爱自己，接纳自己。

Shinji pulled back, and their gaze met for a moment. Asuka's face was the color of her hairclips, and upon noticing this, they both looked away. Cognizant of their reluctancy, they laughed.  
真嗣退后一步，两人的视线短暂相遇。明日香的脸色与她的发夹同色，察觉到这点后，两人都别开了目光。意识到彼此的迟疑，他们不禁笑出声来。

"You're cute when you're like this."  
你这样真可爱。

"Asuka, I'm always like this."  
Asuka，我一向如此。

"Yeah." 对。

Shinji leaned in, and Asuka followed. He wasn't used to taking charge, much less initiating a kiss, but it seemed his time with Asuka was changing his tune. When he kissed her, he felt like the world came to a standstill. All of his anxieties and worries disappeared, replaced with comfort and trust. Through her, he knew himself, and so he kissed deeper.  
真嗣倾身向前，明日香也随之靠近。他不习惯主导，更别提主动亲吻了，然而与明日香共度的时光似乎正在改变他的心境。当他的唇触碰到她时，仿佛世界都凝固了。所有的忧虑和不安烟消云散，心中充满了安宁与信赖。透过她，他更深刻地认识了自己，于是他深情地加深了这个吻。

The sound of the door opening rung behind them. A NERV security guard exclaimed in shock as he witnessed the intimate display between the two pilots. Shinji immidietely tried to push Asuka away, but she wouldn't loosen her grip. Instead, she clung tighter, rested her head on Shinji's chest, and looked at the guard.  
门缓缓开启的声音在背后响起。一名 NERV 的保安见到两位驾驶员如此亲密，不禁惊呼出声。真嗣急忙想推开明日香，可她非但不放手，反而抱得更紧，头倚在真嗣胸前，直视着保安。

"See something you like?" teased Asuka.  
"看到中意的了吗？" 阿苏卡打趣说。

The clearly embarassed guard apologized and moved past the two, continuing down the hallway. Asuka giggled to herself. Shinji placed his hand on her chin and pointed her face towards him.  
明显感到尴尬的警卫道了歉，从两人身边匆匆走过，继续沿着走廊前行。明日香忍不住偷笑。真嗣轻轻托起她的下巴，让她面向自己。

"Oh, so you're okay with people seeing us in public now? Even at NERV?"  
哦，这么说你现在不介意我们在公共场合被人看到了？包括在 NERV？

"Couldn't be worse than Misato walking in last Saturday."  
再糟也糟不过上周六美里突然闯进来那次。

Shinji laughed. She was right, it definitely couldn't get more embarassing than that. Asuka manuvered her body away, and Shinji followed, placing his hand into hers. They continued down the hallway.  
真嗣笑了起来。她说的没错，这尴尬程度已经到顶了。明日香侧身避开，真嗣则紧跟上去，把手放进她的手里。两人就这样继续沿着走廊前行。

"Did you think about where you want to eat yet?" said Asuka.  
"你想好去哪儿吃饭了吗？"阿苏卡问道。

"Uh, well, I'm good with whatever."  
嗯，我无所谓，怎样都好。

"Shinji! I'm giving you the freedom of choice here! You can't just deflect it back to me because you're so indecisive!"  
真嗣！我赋予你选择的自由，别因为你的犹豫不决而将决定权推给我！

"I'm not being indecisive, I genuinely don't care. Wherever you want."  
我并非犹豫，只是真的无所谓。你决定去哪都行。

"I want what you want!"  
我想要的就是你想要的！

"I don't want anything." 我什么都不想要。

"Fine, then we're not eating."  
那行，我们就不吃了。

"I mean, I am hungry—"  
我是说，我肚子饿了——

"Then pick somewhere, damnit!"  
那就选个地方吧，快点！

"Ice cream?" 冰淇淋吗？

Asuka recoiled, "Say it like you mean it!"  
明日香一惊，"说这话得有诚意！"

"Jeez, we'll get ice cream. There's that Happy Cone place we haven't tried yet."  
哎呀，我们去吃冰淇淋吧。那家快乐冰淇淋店我们还没尝试过呢。

Asuka pulled herself closer, resting her head on his shoulder, "I love it when you make decisions for yourself."  
明日香依偎得更近，头枕在他的肩上，柔声说：“我喜欢你独立做决定的样子。”

Shinji rolled his eyes and smiled. He positioned his arm around her shoulders.

The two exited the NERV building, and walked towards the train station. The sun was setting on Tokyo-3, but their night was only beginning. On the train, they sat closely. Asuka teased him for playing a gacha game, and Shinji teased her for being German, something he found to be quite effective in riling up his partner. When the train stopped, it was dark, and Tokyo-3's array of lights was coming to life, just like it was supposed to. Shinji and Asuka walked the streets, which were surprisingly crowded. Various construction efforts continued well into the night.  
两人离开 NERV 大楼，漫步前往火车站。东京-3 的夕阳正缓缓下沉，而他们的夜晚才刚刚拉开序幕。在列车上，他们紧靠而坐。明日香调侃真嗣沉迷于扭蛋游戏，真嗣则以她是德国人这一点来逗弄她，这招总能轻易激起她的情绪。火车到站时，夜幕已降临，东京-3 的灯火辉煌，正如其应有的模样。真嗣和明日香穿梭于熙熙攘攘的街道，各种建筑工程在夜色中依旧忙碌。

As they walked, Shinji looked at the beautiful girl beside him. Just two months ago, they loathed each other. Now, they were inseperable. Their shared experiences and emotions had erupted one night. Their sudden transparency felt good, and as if a miracle took place, they continued to share with one another. They tore down their walls, physically and mentally. They learned to love themselves, and later, each other. Asuka had shared her troubled past, and admitted to Shinji that her constant lashing out was a facade created because deep down, the way she treated others was how she was treated herself. Shinji expressed his anxieties, about himself, the future, and his responsibilities. Early into the morning, after a night of interacting with each other like they had never done before, and a vow to better themselves and each other, they embraced for the first time.  
他们漫步时，真嗣凝视着身旁的美丽女孩。仅仅两个月前，他们还彼此厌恶。现在，他们已密不可分。共同的体验和情感在某夜爆发。突然的坦诚让人感到舒畅，仿佛奇迹降临，他们继续相互倾诉。他们打破了彼此的隔阂，无论是身体还是心灵。他们学会了爱自己，进而，也爱上了对方。明日香坦露了她充满困扰的过去，并向真嗣坦白，她一贯的攻击性其实是一种伪装，因为她内心深处，对待他人的方式正是她自己所经历的。真嗣吐露了他的焦虑，关于自己、未来和肩负的责任。 清晨初现，经历了一夜前所未有的交流，并立下共同进步的誓言，他们首次紧紧相拥。

A neon blue sign with a cheerful, wide-eyed ice cream cone indicated that they had found their stop. The man behind the counter greeted Shinji with a smile, which Shinji reflected back. Asuka chimed in, ordering a large sundae.  
一个霓虹蓝的招牌上，画着一只表情欢快、眼睛大大的冰淇淋，昭示着他们已抵达目的地。柜台后的男子面带微笑地迎接了真嗣，真嗣也回以微笑。这时，明日香插话进来，点了一份大份的圣代。

Shinji began to order, "I'll have a—"  
真嗣开始点菜，"我要一份—"

"Shinji. Do you really think I can finish that all by myself?"  
真嗣，你真的觉得我能一个人搞定所有这些吗？

"I— Oh, yeah." he laughed, and took out his wallet to pay. "That'll be all, thank you."  
我—哦，对。" 他笑着掏出钱包付款。"就这些，谢谢。

Shinji carried the dish to a seat. Asuka sat in front of him, and the two stared at each other for a moment before locking their hands together.  
碇真嗣端着盘子走向座位，明日香坐在他对面。两人对视了一会儿，随后双手紧紧相握。

"I love you." Shinji said.  
"我爱你。" 真嗣说道。

"I love you too." 我也是，爱你。

And that was all that mattered.  
那一切，才是至关重要的。
