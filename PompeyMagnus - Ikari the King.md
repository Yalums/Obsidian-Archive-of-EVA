(这篇完全没有出现 Asuka，同时也没有太多 Rei 的发展，但在塑造 Shinji 上很有可读性)

My shot at Neon Genesis Evangelion from the beginning of the series, with a good amount of twist and a nice dose of ReixShinji romance on the side. Please read and review.  
这是我从系列之初对《新世纪福音战士》的重新演绎，充满了转折，并附带一份丽与真嗣的浪漫情缘。请阅读并点评。

Alright, you all might be saying, "DUDE! WTF! You have like nine billion fanfics already and we ignore them anyway and pay attention to horribly clichéd romance fics!", and I'd say, "Maybe so, but I finished The Mysterious Stranger, so I no longer need to write for that, now I can make a new fanfic…and also, can you pass me some pizza"  
好吧，你们可能会说：“老兄！搞什么鬼！你已经有九十亿篇同人文了，我们本来就无视它们，还去关注那些老掉牙的浪漫小说！”而我则会回答：“或许如此，但我已经写完了《神秘的陌生人》，所以不再需要为那个题材创作了，现在我可以开始新的同人文……另外，能递给我几片披萨吗？”

And so…well, I lost my train of track…I mean, thought…train of thought…  
于是…呃，我跑题了…我是说，思路…思维跑偏了…

Anyway, in other news, I won't tell you a damn thing about this fanfic, just enjoy, it'll be Rei/Shinji romance! Oooh!  
总之，其他消息嘛，关于这篇同人文我什么都不会透露，尽情享受吧，会是丽与真嗣的浪漫故事！哦哦！

Frankly though, to tell you the truth, I'm currently into Hikari/Shinji…the few H/S fanfics here are extremely well-written, better than the average A/S or R/S fanfic. A/S will always be my favorite pairing, but I'm currently more into H/S, Hikari's awesome. Ehehehe…  
老实说，说实话，我现在迷上了光与真嗣…这里的少数 H/S 同人文写得极其出色，比一般的 A/S 或 R/S 同人文要好。A/S 始终是我最爱的配对，但我目前更倾向于 H/S，光太棒了。呵呵呵…

Well, let's start the show. Chapter one!  
好了，让我们开始表演吧。

Disclaimer: I don't own Evangelion or its characters. Gainax does, and they rock. Who else could create both Evangelion and FLCL!  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》或其角色。这些属于 Gainax 公司，他们很棒。还有谁能创造出《新世纪福音战士》和《FLCL》呢！

### Chapter 1 The Birth of the King

**Unknown Location 未知地点**

Gendo Ikari stood, staring at his son emotionlessly as his brother and sister-in-law took the crying child into their small car, waving at the boy's father as they bore him away.  
碇源堂站着，面无表情地盯着他的儿子，而他的弟弟和弟媳将哭泣的孩子抱进他们的小车里，向男孩的父亲挥手告别，带着他离开了。

Shinji Ikari seemed to be almost screaming within the car, and although Gendo could no longer hear the noises, he knew very well what his child was saying.  
碇真嗣在车里似乎几乎是在尖叫，尽管碇源堂已经听不到声音，但他非常清楚自己的孩子正在说什么。

"_No! Where's mamma! Don't leave me! Please! Stop it! No!"_  
“不！妈妈在哪里！不要离开我！求求你！停下来！不！”

Gendo turned away, a moist tear flowing down his left cheek, making him enraged, wiping away the wetness in distaste.  
源堂转过身去，左颊上一滴湿润的泪珠滑落，令他愤怒不已，厌恶地抹去那片湿润。

Suddenly he locked eyes with an approaching man, short and gruff, with a shock of graying black hair and dark black shades.  
突然，他与一个迎面而来的男人四目相对，那人矮小而粗鲁，一头灰黑交杂的头发，戴着深黑色的墨镜。

Keel Lorenz looked at Gendo Ikari with an unreadable expression, and then turned away, speaking, his voice almost too quiet to hear.  
基尔·洛伦兹看着源堂·碇，脸上表情难以捉摸，随即转身离开，低声说道，声音几乎轻到听不见。

"What had to be done…was done, Gendo Ikari. You know of what the Scrolls say…that child was destined to fail you…to kill you… It was admirable that you attempted to cling to the boy as a product of love from your former wife, and care for him in a way you could never truly understand. We are different from them, you understand. Sending him away is the only choice, since you are too human to give the poor boy the comfort of death."  
“必须完成的事……已经完成了，碇源堂。你知晓卷轴所言……那孩子注定要让你失望……要杀你……你试图将他视为前妻爱情的产物，并以一种你无法真正理解的方式照顾他，这令人钦佩。我们与他们不同，你明白的。将他送走是唯一的选择，因为你太过人性，无法给予那可怜孩子死亡的慰藉。”

Gendo turned around, walking away from the older man, although he seemed to nod to himself, ignoring the strange wetness gathering under his eyes.  
碇源堂转过身，远离那位年长者，尽管他似乎对自己点了点头，忽略了眼中聚集的奇怪湿润。

**Eleven Years Later 十一年后**

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

Tokyo 3 shook under yet another rumbling explosion, the city empty and dreary in the cool sunlight.  
又一次轰鸣的爆炸震颤着第三新东京市，城市在清凉的阳光下空旷而阴沉。

Shinji Ikari sighed as he leaned against a wall which occasionally shook every few minutes, sending a cloud of dust onto his dark hair.  
碇真嗣叹了口气，靠在每隔几分钟就会摇晃一次的墙上，墙上的灰尘不时落在他乌黑的头发上。

_Why did I return again? Just because he asked me to? Do I really believe that he'll treat me any differently?  
我为何又回来了？仅仅因为他让我这么做吗？我真的相信他会对我有所不同吗？_

The young man listlessly strolled to the telephone booth, staring at it as he slowly picked up the phone.  
年轻人无精打采地走向电话亭，盯着它，缓缓地拿起话筒。

_I won't ever forget what he did…I promised it to myself…No matter what he's like now, it changes nothing.  
我永远不会忘记他所做的事……我对自己发过誓……无论他现在如何，这都改变不了什么。_

He sighed once more as he tried to dial the numbers on the unresponsive telephone, receiving only an automated voice.  
他再次叹息，试图在无反应的电话上拨号，只听到自动语音。

"All normal lines are out of order due to the state of special emergency."  
“由于特殊紧急状态，所有正常线路均已中断。”

Shinji shook his head angrily, slamming his fist into the pay phone.  
真嗣愤怒地摇摇头，一拳砸在公用电话上。

"Dammit, why did I even come back? I knew this wasn't a good idea."  
"该死，我为什么要回来？我知道这不是个好主意。"

"Do you always talk to yourself, Mr. Ikari? That is one of the first signs of schizophrenia"  
"你总是自言自语吗，碇先生？那是精神分裂症的最初迹象之一。"

"Eh?" "诶？"

Shinji Ikari turned around to see a blonde woman next to a small black car, smiling slightly at him.  
碇真嗣转过身，看到一位金发女子站在一辆黑色小车旁，对他微微一笑。

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

"We have visual image of our target, transferring it to the primary monitors."  
“我们已获取目标的视觉图像，正在传输至主监视器。”

The technicians around the control room began typing frantically on their consoles as data screens flashed around the great chamber, showing a great hulking black creature with gray plate like shoulders and a large crimson orb at its center.  
控制室内的技术人员们疯狂地在控制台上敲击，数据屏幕在大厅中闪烁，显示出一个巨大的黑色生物，肩部覆盖着灰色的板状结构，中心嵌有一颗巨大的深红色球体。

The creatures was batting away floating military VTOLs with apparent ease, their missiles and machine gun fire having no visible effect.  
这生物轻松地击退着空中悬浮的军用 VTOL 战机，它们的导弹和机枪射击似乎对其毫无影响。

"The identified moving target is still rapidly approaching our position."  
"已识别的移动目标仍在迅速接近我们的位置。"

Gendo Ikari stared at the creature, his hands folded in front of his face, silent, brooding as the gaunt gray-haired man beside him spoke.  
碇源堂凝视着那生物，双手交叉于面前，沉默不语，一旁瘦削灰发的男子正说着什么。

"It's been fifteen years…"  
"已经十五年了……"

"Indeed…" “确实…”

"They have returned." “他们回来了。”

Misato Katsuragi stood, pacing in front of the screens, staring at the Angel before her with calculating eyes.  
葛城美里站在屏幕前，来回踱步，用精明的目光盯着眼前的使徒。

_Fifteen years ago…They've returned, father…And I'll get the revenge you deserve.  
十五年前……他们回来了，父亲……我会为你讨回应有的复仇。_

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，东京 3 号**

Shinji Ikari let out yet another yelp as countless shockwaves rocked the city around him, sending foundations crumbling and stone and rubble to the ground.  
碇真嗣再次发出一声惊叫，无数冲击波在他周围震动着城市，导致地基崩塌，石块和碎石纷纷坠落。

In the distance he could see what was causing it, his eyes widening as he realized how large it was and how close it was, relative to its size.  
在远处，他能看到造成这一切的原因，随着意识到它的巨大和相对于其尺寸的接近程度，他的眼睛不禁睁大了。

The Angel batted away another floating VTOL, sending it flaming down into a building below, and continued making its stalking, hunched advanced.  
天使再次拍飞了一架悬浮的 VTOL，使其燃烧着坠入下方的一栋建筑，然后继续它那蹒跚、佝偻的前进。

"What…the" “这…到底…”

"That is an Angel, Mr. Ikari."  
"那是使徒，碇同学。"

Shinji barely stopped himself from jumping in surprise, having forgotten completely about the women behind him.  
真嗣差点惊跳起来，完全忘记了身后还有那位女士。

He spun around, peering at her.  
他转过身，仔细打量着她。

She seemed relatively young, dressed in a white lab coat, with obviously dyed blonde hair over dark eyebrows and a single freckle.  
她看起来相当年轻，身着白色实验服，一头显然是染成的金发下是深色的眉毛，脸上还带着一颗小雀斑。

"And you are?" “那么，你是？”

"You're obviously the boy, Shinji Ikari, the Third Child."  
“你显然就是那个男孩，碇真嗣，第三适格者。”

"Uh…Yeah…Third Child? But you didn't answer my ques-"  
"呃…是的…第三适格者？但你还没回答我的问…"

"I am Dr. Ritsuko Akagi, head scientist of the Evangelion Project; I'll be your escort for today. Come with me."  
"我是赤木律子博士，EVA 计划的首席科学家；今天将由我担任你的向导。跟我来。"

Shinji felt another rumbling shockwave and turned around, noticing worryingly that the creatures was getting closer and closer, and getting into the car was his best bet, no matter how hesitant he was to meet his father.  
真嗣感到又一阵震动冲击波，转身发现那怪物越来越近，坐进车里是他最好的选择，尽管他对见父亲感到犹豫不决。

He clenched his fists, peering at the creature and then Ritsuko, who was in the driver seat of her small black sedan, tapping her nails impatiently against the steering wheel.  
他紧握双拳，盯着那生物，然后又看向坐在她那辆黑色小轿车驾驶座上的律子，她正不耐烦地用指甲敲打着方向盘。

Finally he nodded to himself, quickly running into the passenger seat as another shockwave shook the city.  
最终他自顾自地点了点头，迅速跑进副驾驶座，与此同时，又一阵冲击波震撼了整个城市。

Ritsuko sighed, starting the car, not looking at the boy.  
律子叹了口气，启动了汽车，没有看向那个男孩。

"I thought you'd never come…"  
"我以为你永远不会来了…"

Shinji peered at her curiously, wondering what the statement meant and how well this woman knew him and his father.  
真嗣好奇地看着她，想知道这句话的含义，以及这位女士对他和他父亲的了解程度。

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

"Target is intact, it's continuing inside Tokyo 3."  
目标完好无损，正继续在第三新东京市内行进。

"It cannot be stopped by U.N. Air Force power."  
联合国空军力量无法阻止它。

The screen showed the black creature dodging a large missile, then taking an even large weapon in the chest, resulting in an enormous explosion that seemed to do little more than faze the unstoppable monster.  
屏幕上显示着那黑色生物闪避一枚巨大的导弹，随后胸口被一件更大的武器击中，引发了一场巨大的爆炸，似乎对这不可阻挡的怪物影响甚微。

Three men were crowded around a table, adorned in U.N. regalia.  
三名男子围坐在一张桌子旁，身着联合国制服。

One of them, the taller of the two, stood up with a snort.  
其中一位，是两人中较高的那位，哼了一声站起身来。

"Decimate the target! Commit all divisions at Atsugi and Iruma Bases to the battle!"  
"彻底摧毁目标！命令厚木和入间基地的所有部队投入战斗！"

"Hold nothing back; destroy the target at all costs!"  
"全力以赴；不惜一切代价摧毁目标！"

The technicians continued to type frantically on their consoles, shouting out reports at random intervals, although everything could be see quite clearly on the screen.  
技术人员继续在控制台上疯狂地敲击，不时随机地大声报告，尽管屏幕上一切都清晰可见。

The great creature strode forward, raising its hand and firing what seemed to be an energy beam towards a group of VTOLs, decimating them instantly.  
那巨大的生物大步向前，举起手来，发射出一道看似能量光束，瞬间摧毁了一群垂直起降飞机。

"Guided missiles and shells are having no affect on the target! More than half of the air brigade and the entire tank battalion have been completely destroyed!"  
“制导导弹和炮弹对目标毫无作用！超过一半的空军部队和整个坦克营已被彻底摧毁！”

One of the U.N. Commanders slammed his fist into the table, growling.  
一名联合国指挥官猛地一拳砸在桌上，咆哮着。

"It's useless! What can we do against it with the firepower we have!"  
"这没用！以我们现有的火力，能拿它怎么办！"

Suddenly the ring of a telephone interrupted the old man's tirade, and he picked it up, answering.  
突然，电话铃声打断了老人的咆哮，他拿起电话，接听起来。

"Yes…yes…understood. It must be deployed then…as previously arranged."  
"是的……是的……明白了。那么必须按原计划部署……"

Gendo peered at the screen as the older man standing next to him leaned in, speaking in almost a whisper.  
源渡凝视着屏幕，站在他身旁的年长男子微微倾身，几乎耳语般地说道。

"So, it's protected by an A.T. Field, as we thought?"  
“那么，正如我们所料，它被 A.T.力场保护着？”

"Yes…their weapons will have no affect against the Angels."  
“是的……他们的武器对使徒毫无作用。”

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

Shinji peered out of the corner of his eye at Ritsuko occasionally as they sped down the rubble and road.  
真嗣不时用眼角余光偷偷观察着律子，他们沿着废墟和道路疾驰。

_What kind of person is this Dr. Akagi? What does my father do? And what the hell was that creature!  
赤木博士是怎样的人？我父亲究竟在做什么？还有那到底是什么怪物！_

Ritsuko's eyes passed over Shinji for a second as she stepped harder on the gas, the car accelerating.  
律子的目光在真嗣身上短暂停留，随即更用力地踩下油门，汽车加速前进。

"I'm sure you have a lot of questions, Shinji. But right now, we've got a major problem on our hands. Hopefully we're far enough to escape the explosion."  
“我确信你有很多问题，真嗣。但现在，我们手头有个大麻烦。希望我们已经逃得够远，能躲过这场爆炸。”

"Explosion? What's-" “爆炸？什么——”

Ritsuko glanced at Shinji once more, before speaking, her voice firm.  
律子再次瞥了一眼真嗣，然后坚定地开口说话。

"N2" N2

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，东京 3 号**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

One of the U.N. Commanders stuck his fist in the air, roaring in approval as the metal cylinder made a direct hit on the creature, an enormous explosion rocking the creature, all the screens in the chambers going off and on with static.  
一名联合国指挥官挥拳向天，大声喝彩，金属圆筒正中目标，巨大的爆炸震撼着怪物，室内所有屏幕都闪烁着静电雪花。

"Yes! Contact has been made!"  
“太好了！命中目标了！”

"Shockwave inbound!" "冲击波来袭！"

The commander smirked triumphantly, turning to Gendo.  
指挥官得意地冷笑，转向源渡。

"Well, I suppose there was no need for you after all, Mr. Ikari, now there won't be anything left for you. The N2 Tactical Nuclear Weapon is quite good, if I might say so myself."  
"好吧，看来你已经没有存在的必要了，碇先生，现在你将一无所有。N2 战术核武器确实不错，我得说。"

The Commander of NERV simply remained silent, peering past the man at the video screens behind him.  
NERV 的指挥官只是静静地沉默着，透过那人望向他身后的视频屏幕。

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，东京-3**

Shinji held tight onto his seat as he felt what seemed at first like a miniscule gust of wind, then a powerful bubble of heat slam into the car, not overcoming it yet apparently, as Ritsuko drove furiously.  
真嗣紧紧抓住座位，起初感觉像是一阵微风，随后一股强大的热浪猛烈撞击着汽车，尽管没有将其击溃，但律子依旧疯狂地驾驶着。

"Dammit, I'm losing control of it…Why did those fools have to use the N2…Don't they know that…"  
"该死，我快控制不住它了……那些蠢货为什么要用 N2……他们难道不知道……"

She was cut off as the car swerved from the shockwave, slamming into a nearby pole, the windows shimmering as they exploded, shards of glass flying into the air.  
她的话被冲击波打断，车子猛地转向，撞上了附近的电线杆，窗户在爆炸中闪烁，玻璃碎片四散飞溅。

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，东京-3**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

The U.N. commander stared at the technicians running about in the control room with a smirk as the data screens all showed static.  
联合国指挥官冷笑着看着技术人员在控制室里忙碌，所有数据屏幕上都显示着静态画面。

_Hmph. This entire NERV operation was foolishness, since the beginning. I'll be sure to nominate budget cuts now that it's become apparent that their usefulness is minimal.  
哼，从一开始，整个 NERV 行动就是愚蠢的。既然现在已经明显看出他们的用处微乎其微，我一定会提议削减预算。_

"What is current condition of the target?"  
"目标当前状况如何？"

"It's undetermined due to radio wave interference, our visual is down."  
"由于电波干扰，无法确定，我们的视觉信号中断了。"

"Hmm, it was such a massive explosion; the end result is not in doubt."  
"嗯，那场爆炸如此巨大；结果毋庸置疑。"

Suddenly the bridge crew looked up as their consoles lighted up, displaying odd waves and frequencies.  
突然间，舰桥上的船员们抬头望去，他们的控制台亮了起来，显示出奇怪的波形和频率。

"Sensors again operational."  
“传感器再次启动了。”

"There's a large energy source at the center of the explosion site!"  
“爆炸现场中心有一个巨大的能量源！”

"What the hell!" "搞什么鬼！"

"Visual image restored." "视觉图像恢复。"

The screen displayed the Angel, its slightly melted plates coming through a great cloud of smoke and ash, apparently not neutralized at all.  
屏幕上显示着使徒，其略微融化的装甲板透过浓重的烟尘显现，显然并未被完全中和。

"What!" "什么！"

"That was our trump card…"  
"那是我们的王牌…"

"Dammit…this is unbelievable…"  
"该死…这真是难以置信…"

"It's a monster!" “是怪兽！”

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

Shinji Ikari groaned, the dark numbness around him clearing as he felt a warm drop of blood flow down his forehead.  
碇真嗣呻吟着，周围的黑暗麻木感逐渐消散，他感觉到一滴温热的血从额头流下。

"Hmm, you seem relatively unhurt, we were both quite lucky, I suppose."  
"嗯，你看起来伤得不重，我们俩都算幸运了。"

To his right, Ritsuko Akagi shook the dust and broken glass off her clothes, looking through the now nonexistent windshield to the point where her car had collided into the steel support pole.  
在他的右边，赤木律子拍打着衣服上的灰尘和碎玻璃，透过已经不复存在的挡风玻璃，望向她的车撞上的那根钢制支撑柱。

"Your car…" "你的车……"

Ritsuko wiped the dust and blood off her chin, turning the ignition, the car coming on with a muffled roar, to Shinji's surprise.  
律子擦去下巴上的尘土和血迹，转动钥匙，汽车伴随着低沉的轰鸣声启动了，这让真嗣颇感意外。

"Hmm, at least it still drives..."  
“嗯，至少还能开……”

She put the broken car into reverse and then continued to drive down the road she had gone, not paying any real attention to the enormous crater in the distance, or the regenerating monster in the background.  
她将破损的车挂入倒挡，然后继续沿着来时的路行驶，对远处巨大的弹坑或背景中正在复原的怪兽并未多加留意。

She spoke into her cell phone, rapidly, her eyes listlessly on the road.  
她对着手机快速地说着，目光无神地盯着路面。

"Yes, I've picked him up. No, he's alive; his life is my highest priority at this time. Prepare a train car for us, a linear one. Right, I'll be delivering him in approximately ten minutes."  
“是的，我已经接到了他。不，他还活着；目前他的生命是我最优先考虑的事。为我们准备一节列车车厢，线性的那种。好的，我大约十分钟后送达。”

Shinji sighed, turning his head to look out the window at the destroyed buildings around him.  
真嗣叹了口气，转头望向窗外，看着周围被毁的建筑。

_Deliver? I'm just an object to him; I suppose…What do they want from me?  
交付？在他眼里我不过是个物品；我想……他们到底想要我做什么？_

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，东京第三新都**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

Everyone in the control room, from the NERV technicians to the U.N. Commanders stared at the video screen silently, as the black creature seemed to shed the little flesh damaged from the N2 explosion, apparently regenerating it fresh from within.  
控制室内的每个人，从 NERV 的技术人员到联合国指挥官，都默默地盯着视频屏幕，只见那黑色生物似乎在剥离 N2 爆炸造成的轻微损伤的肉体，显然是从内部再生出新鲜的组织。

Fuyutsuki leaned forward and spoke, as Gendo remained silent, his hands still folded in front of his face.  
冬月向前倾身，开口说道，而碇源堂依旧沉默，双手依然交叉在脸前。

"It's regenerating itself. Once again, as expected."  
“它在自我再生。又一次，正如预期。”

"Indeed…If it was incapable of that it would be useless as an independent weapon."  
"确实……如果连这都做不到，那它作为独立武器就毫无用处了。"

"Hmm, I'm impressed with it, it seems to be able to amplify its own functions and grow in power."  
"嗯，我对它印象深刻，似乎能够放大自身功能并增强力量。"

"In addition, it has inevitably gained intelligence from experience."  
"此外，它也必然从经验中获得了智慧。"

"Yes…the next invasion is only a matter of time."  
“是的……下一次入侵只是时间问题。”

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，东京-3**

Shinji remained silent, peering out the window as the car-transport began departing from the station, Ritsuko having finally managed to maneuver the shattered sedan onto the designated platform, a recorded female voice playing loud.  
真嗣保持沉默，透过车窗凝视着，随着汽车运输车开始驶离车站，律子终于设法将那辆破碎的轿车移到了指定的平台上，一个录制的女性声音大声播放着。

"The gate is closing. Attention, please. The train is about to depart. This train ..."  
"车门即将关闭，请注意。列车即将发车。本次列车……"

Shinji stared silently at the black booklet Ritsuko had handed him only seconds later.  
真嗣默默地盯着几秒钟前赤木律子递给他的黑色小册子。

"The NERV agency?" "NERV 机构？"

"Yes, it's an organization directly tied to the United Nations…"  
"是的，这是一个直接隶属于联合国的组织……"

"And…that's what my father belongs to, correct?"  
"而……我的父亲就是属于这个组织的，对吗？"

"Correct, do you know what he does, Shinji?"  
"没错，你知道他做什么工作吗，真嗣？"

Shinji turned away again, for a moment, his face distant.  
真嗣再次转过身去，有那么一会儿，他的表情显得遥远。

"Supposedly some important job, protecting the human race…at least that's what my uncle told me."  
“据说是保护人类的重要任务……至少我叔叔是这么告诉我的。”

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

Gendo Ikari stood silently and emotionlessly before the three seated U.N. men, as they stared at him with clearly visible distaste.  
碇源堂面无表情地静静站在三位坐着的联合国代表面前，他们以明显可见的厌恶目光盯着他。

"You have command of this operation from this point on. We'll observe how you handle the situation."  
“从现在起，你负责这次行动。我们将观察你如何处理这一局面。”

"Yes, sir." "是的，先生。"

"Ikari, considering our available weaponry, I must admit that we have no effective defense or offense against the target."  
"碇，考虑到我们现有的武器装备，我必须承认我们对此目标既无有效防御也无进攻手段。"

"And you are confident that you are capable of defeating it?"  
"那么你确信自己有能力击败它吗？"

"It is for that sole purpose that NERV exists."  
"NERV 正是为此唯一目的而存在。"

"Indeed, we shall not tolerate failure."  
"确实，我们不容许失败。"

The commanders nodded their farewells as the platform bearing them and the table they sat behind was lowered down, away into the darkness, disappearing completely from view.  
指挥官们点头告别，承载着他们和身后桌子的平台缓缓下降，消失在黑暗中，完全不见了踪影。

The technicians began rapidly typing on their consoles as the Angel continued striding forward, now no longer hindered by ineffective U.N. attempts and apparently completely healed from the nuclear attack.  
技术人员们开始在控制台上迅速敲击，使徒继续大步前进，不再受到无效的联合国尝试的阻碍，显然已经从核攻击中完全恢复。

"No change in target…" “目标无变化……”

"Present effective rate of interception is seven point five percent."  
“当前有效拦截率为百分之七点五。”

Fuyutsuki strode towards Gendo Ikari, his face somber.  
冬月走向碇源堂，面色凝重。

"The U.N. can no longer assist us…What will you do?"  
“联合国已无法再支援我们……你打算怎么办？”

Gendo locked eyes with the old man, although his eyes were hidden slightly by his shimmering glasses.  
碇源堂与老人对视，尽管他的眼神被闪烁的眼镜稍稍遮掩。

"I will activate Evangelion Unit 01."  
"我将启动初号机。"

"Unit 01? But we have no pilot. Rei is still quite injured."  
"初号机？但我们没有驾驶员。绫波丽还受着伤。"

"Not a problem, another pilot is being delivered as we speak."  
"没问题，另一位驾驶员正在送来的路上。"

"What?" “什么？”

Gendo looked away, silent, a smirk appearing on his face.  
源度转过头去，沉默不语，脸上却浮现出一丝讥笑。

"Don't tell me…No, Ikari, don't tell me you're sending for him? After all these years? You remember what the Scrolls decreed! You abandoned him for a reason, you understand that, returning him could have horrible consequences"  
“别告诉我……不，碇，别告诉我你要派人去找他？这么多年过去了？你还记得卷轴上的预言吧！你当初抛弃他是有原因的，你明白的，把他找回来可能会带来可怕的后果。”

The Commander of NERV smirked.  
NERV 的指挥官轻蔑地笑了。

"The Scrolls! I put no faith in that antique garbage any longer…You remember the Antarctic incident…We have no choice."  
“那些卷轴！我再也不相信那堆古董垃圾了……你记得南极事件……我们别无选择。”

Ikari paused and then strode forward, staring at Sachiel's nightmarish form.  
碇停顿了一下，然后大步向前，凝视着萨基尔那噩梦般的形态。

"Indeed…as I said before, a new candidate is being delivered as we speak."  
确实……正如我之前所说，一个新的候选人正在送达途中。

---

Well, this is the first chapter…and it may have gone by the book really (literally, in some cases), with some minor differences, but things will be splitting away from the original timeline of events increasingly as we go about the next few chapters.  
好吧，这是第一个chapter……它可能确实按照书上的步骤进行了（在某些情况下，字面意义上），只是有些细微的差别，但随着我们进入接下来的几章，事情将越来越偏离原始的事件时间线。

And remember, R/S fans, this is a Rei/Shinji romance fic in part, we'll get to it eventually…I haven't even introduced the young albino yet. Hehehe.  
记住，R/S 粉丝们，这是一部部分涉及丽/真嗣浪漫故事的同人小说，我们最终会讲到的……我甚至还没介绍那位年轻的白化病少年呢。呵呵呵。

Well, see you next chapter.  
好吧，下次chapter见。

### Chapter 2 The Trials of the King

Hmm, well here we are in Chapter Two of my second "Rei/Shinji" fic…which surprises me, since I never was a real Rei/Shinji fan, and I still am not a Rei/Shinji fan, at least when it comes to actually reading Rei/Shinji fanfics…Because there aren't that many good ones, heck I don't even think mine are that great…  
嗯，我们来到了Chapter，我的第二篇“丽/真嗣”同人文……这让我有些惊讶，因为我从来都不是一个真正的丽/真嗣粉丝，现在也不是，至少在阅读丽/真嗣同人文方面……因为好的作品并不多，见鬼，我甚至不觉得我的作品有多出色……

Lately I like Hikari/Shinji, although I'll always be an Asuka/Shinji fan at heart…I've also been meaning to write some Ritsuko/Gendo, or something along the lines of a Gendo romance…eheheh.  
最近我喜欢上了光/真嗣这对 CP，尽管我内心始终是明日香/真嗣的粉丝……我也一直想写一些律子/源堂，或者类似源堂的浪漫故事……嘿嘿。

Well, thanks for the feedback, keep it coming, let's begin Chapter Two.  
嗯，感谢反馈，请继续，让我们开始Chapter第二章。  

Disclaimer: I don't own Evangelion or its characters. Gainax does, and they rock. Who else could create both Evangelion and FLCL!  
声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》或其角色。这些属于 GAINAX，他们很棒。还有谁能创造出《新世纪福音战士》和《FLCL》呢！

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

Ritsuko stared at the boy riding alongside her, studying him closely out of the corner of her eye. He was an ordinary-looking boy, if such a thing could be said; although it was true he resembled his father in many ways, albeit apparently not in behavior.  
律子盯着旁边骑车的男孩，用眼角仔细打量着他。他看起来很普通，如果可以用这个词来形容的话；尽管他在很多方面确实像他的父亲，但显然在行为上并非如此。

Suddenly, a great crashing boom shook both of them, Ritsuko struggling to keep her eyes on the road and stop her car from careening into a pole.  
突然，一声巨大的轰鸣震动了两人，律子挣扎着保持视线在道路上，努力不让车子撞到电线杆上。

Shinji gasped at the explosion, staring out the window at a large monstrous creature facing the Angel.  
真嗣被爆炸声惊得倒吸一口气，透过窗户望向一个巨大的怪物正面对着使徒。

"What the hell is-" "这到底是什么-"

"That's on our side…let's go…_now._"  
"那是在我们这边…快走…现在。"

Ritsuko stepped on the gas, driving faster than she ever had, as rubble seemed to fall from the sky like rain.  
律子踩下油门，比以往任何时候都开得更快，仿佛碎石从天而降，如同暴雨一般。

Ikari managed to take one last look back at the creatures, as they sped away. He could see the purple robot being beaten down to the ground, and sighed.  
伊卡里在疾驰而去之际，勉强回头望了最后一眼那些生物。他看到紫色机器人被击倒在地，不禁叹了口气。

_Guess our team isn't doing that great…eh.  
看来我们队伍表现不怎么样啊……唉。_

Shinji peered at the NERV manual and sighed, looking out the window as Ritsuko spoke.  
真嗣翻看着 NERV 手册，叹了口气，目光转向窗外，听着律子讲话。

"I work there too, you know. If you ever have any medical problems, do come to me…"  
"我也在那里工作，你知道的。如果有什么健康问题，尽管来找我……"

Shinji seemed to smile wryly, although he averted his eyes from her.  
真嗣似乎苦笑了一下，尽管他避开了她的目光。

"So you mean you're in 'the admirable job of defending humanity'?"  
"这么说，你是从事‘保卫人类的崇高工作’了？"

Ritsuko chuckled, smiling.  
律子轻声笑了起来，面带微笑。

"Yes, I suppose you could say that…"  
“是的，我想你可以这么说……”

She suddenly stopped the car as they rode up on a large circular platform. Shinji could hear odd electronic noises, and then, all of a sudden, they began to rush forward, although the car remained parked there.  
她突然停下车，当他们驶上一个巨大的圆形平台时。真嗣能听到奇怪的电子声，然后，突然间，他们开始急速前进，尽管车子还停在那里。

"Um, Miss Akagi?" "呃，赤木小姐？"

"Dr. Akagi" "赤木博士"

Ritsuko corrected him with a genial smile.  
律子带着和蔼的微笑纠正了他。

Shinji seemed to gaze dreamily off into the distance as he spoke.  
真嗣似乎若有所思地凝视着远方，缓缓开口。

"Why did my father summon me here? I thought he'd completely forgotten about me after abandoning me…"  
“父亲为何召唤我至此？我以为他在抛弃我之后早已将我遗忘……”

Ritsuko Akagi stared at him carefully, making sure to analyze his psychological background a little more deeply when she had the free time, nodding to herself as she locked eyes with him and spoke.  
赤木律子仔细地盯着他，暗自决定在有空时更深入地分析他的心理背景，她与他对视，点头说道。

"Perhaps it would be…better to ask your father directly, eh?"  
"或许直接问你父亲会更好，嗯？"

Shinji averted his eyes, staring at his lap as Ritsuko looked away.  
真嗣移开视线，盯着膝盖，而律子则转过头去。

"We're on our way to see him, aren't we"  
"我们正要去见他，不是吗"

Ritsuko stared at Shinji's image in the rearview mirror, the perfect manifestation of a sulking teenager and smirked.  
律子透过后视镜盯着真嗣的影像，完美地展现了一个闹别扭的青少年的模样，她微微一笑。

"You're not comfortable with your father, are you?"  
“你和你父亲相处得不自在，对吧？”

_Not like many people are…  
不像许多人那样……_

Shinji shut his eyes as he spoke, the platform hurtling the car at an amazing speed down across the different platforms, neither of them taking real notice of the surroundings, Ritsuko because of familiarity, Shinji because of apathy..  
真嗣闭上眼睛说话时，平台正以惊人的速度将汽车沿着不同的平台疾驰，他们俩都没有真正注意到周围的环境，律子是因为熟悉，真嗣则是因为冷漠。

"It's not that…it's just that this is inconvenient. Besides…even if I do see him…I know we'll just end up butting heads anyway."  
“不是那样的……只是这样不方便。而且……即使我见到他……我也知道我们最终还是会争执不休。”

Suddenly a burst of light and Shinji's eyes opened wide in a genuine gesture of surprise and awe as he viewed all the great columns of buildings, coming down from above.  
突然一道光芒闪现，真嗣的眼睛因真正的惊讶和敬畏而睁得大大的，他看到了从上方降下的一排排宏伟建筑。

"What is this? Wow! Is that? It's a real geofront."  
"这是什么？哇！那是？真的是地底都市。"

Ritsuko nodded slowly. 律子缓缓点头。

"Yes it is…Our secret base of operations, NERV Headquarters…the keystone for the resurrection of the world, and the stronghold of humanity."  
"没错……我们的秘密行动基地，NERV 总部……世界复兴的关键，人类最后的堡垒。"

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

Kouzou stared at the video screen, baring the image of a pale girl being pushed down the hall in a stretcher, she seemed to be gasping, her eyes shut and twisted in pain.  
高雄盯着视频屏幕，画面中一个苍白的女孩被推在担架上沿着走廊移动，她似乎在喘息，双眼紧闭，面容因痛苦而扭曲。

"Evangelion Unit 01 recovery operation complete!"  
「初号机回收作业完成！」

"Pilot has suffered severe injuries!"  
「驾驶员遭受重伤！」

"There's a possibility of splenic ruptures."  
"有脾脏破裂的可能。"

The Sub-Commander shook his head, turning away.  
副指挥官摇了摇头，转身离开。

"The U.N. is beating a full retreat as well…"  
"联合国也在全面撤退……"

Misato strode beside him, peering at the old, stoic man.  
美里大步走在他身旁，盯着那位古板的老者。

"What are your intentions?"  
“你有什么意图？”

Gendo Ikari smirked as he strode back into the control room, peering around.  
碇源堂冷笑一声，大步走回控制室，环顾四周。

"The reserve pilot as arrived as we speak."  
“后备驾驶员已经到了。”

The screens all around began to come up with the streaming video of a young boy walking alongside a tall blonde woman, down a distant NERV catwalk.  
四周的屏幕开始播放一个年轻男孩与一位高挑金发女子沿着远处 NERV 通道行走的实时视频。

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Unknown Location  
NERV 总部，未知地点**

Ritsuko strode down the catwalk quite quickly as Shinji followed as dutifully as he could. She was quite used to the layout of the base, after having spent a good amount of time in it, from working there to visiting her mother.  
律子快步走过天桥，真嗣尽可能尽职地跟在后面。她对基地的布局非常熟悉，毕竟在这里工作了很长时间，从工作到探望母亲。

She stopped suddenly, and boarded the long moving walkway down as Shinji stepped onto it behind her.  
她突然停下，踏上那条长长的移动步道，真嗣紧随其后也站了上去。

She sighed, peering back at Shinji.  
她叹了口气，回头看着真嗣。

_God, I shouldn't have worn a skirt on this thing…damn kid can probably see everything from there.  
天啊，我真不该在这玩意儿上穿裙子……那小鬼估计从那儿能看个一清二楚。_

Shinji meanwhile hadn't noticed anything, and was instead peering off into a random point above, frowning.  
与此同时，真嗣并没有注意到任何异常，而是皱着眉头，凝视着上方某个随机的点。

_I should have thought a little more about why my father would summon me to him…  
我本该多想想父亲为何会召见我……_

It took a while for them to finally arrive on what seemed like ground level, and then they took a few more minutes walking through random sliding doors, but overall it seemed like Ritsuko knew what she was doing.  
他们花了些时间才终于到达了看似地面层的地方，然后又花了好几分钟穿过随机滑动的门，但总体来看，丽素子似乎知道自己在做什么。

Then all of a sudden she paused and peered at Shinji with an almost confidential smile that almost made him blush.  
然后，她突然停下脚步，带着几乎像是密谈般的微笑凝视着真嗣，这几乎让他脸红了。

"Come along Shinji, there's something I want to show you before you see your father.  
“来吧，真嗣，在你见你父亲之前，我有样东西想给你看。”

"You have something…to show me? I see…"  
"你有东西……要给我看？我明白了……"

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

Commander Gendo Ikari stood there, glaring at the huge screen emblazoned with an enormous monstrosity of black, trudging its way through leveled buildings, smoke, and fire.  
指挥官碇源堂站在那里，目光锐利地盯着巨大的屏幕，上面显示着一个庞大的黑色怪物，正蹒跚地穿过夷为平地的建筑、烟雾和火焰。

"Commander!" "指挥官！"

"The angel is advancing! It's broken through the Power Mine Final Defense Perimeter!"  
"天使正在推进！它已经突破了能源矿区最终防御圈！"

"So…PMFDP has failed…" "那么……能源矿区最终防御圈已经失守……"

"It's adjusted its progression vector by five degrees and is still approaching!"  
"它调整了前进方向，偏转了五度，仍在逼近！"

"The predicted target destination is exactly directly above us!"  
"预测的目标降落点就在我们正上方！"

Gendo turned around, swinging his arm over the area.  
源度转过身，挥动手臂指向那个区域。

"All right, first wave personnel to battle stations!"  
"好了，第一波人员立即前往战斗岗位！"

"Yes sir!" “是的，长官！”

A recorded female voice almost instantly echoed Gendo, as if he was in some odd cave, and everyone began to rush about, making preparations.  
一个录制的女性声音几乎立刻回应了源渡，仿佛他身处某个奇异的洞穴中，所有人开始匆忙行动，进行准备。

"First wave personnel to battle stations! Repeat, first wave personnel to battle stations! Red alert! All hands to battle stations."  
“第一波人员前往战斗岗位！重复，第一波人员前往战斗岗位！红色警报！全体人员前往战斗岗位。”

Kouzou sighed, peering at the Commander.  
高造叹了口气，凝视着指挥官。

_Their first reunion after so many years and he won't even take the time to meet his son…  
这么多年来第一次重逢，他甚至不愿意花时间见见他的儿子……_

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Unknown Location  
NERV 总部，未知地点**

The recorded voice echoed into Shinji's ears as the small boat carried them across the dark, murky, almost sort of pinkish water.  
录音中的声音回荡在真嗣的耳边，小船载着他们穿过黑暗、浑浊，近乎带点粉色的水面。

"Prepare to initialize anti-ground attack Unit 01."  
“准备启动对地攻击单位 01。”

Shinji peered around the area, confused.  
真嗣环顾四周，感到困惑。

"Wait, what do they mean?"  
“等等，他们是什么意思？”

Ritsuko simply peered at Shinji silently, not answering.  
律子只是静静地盯着真嗣，没有回答。

_Unit-01 is currently cooling down while in defensive formation B…I t can be reinitialized at any time…Then the N2 bombs didn't work against the angel…it only suffered minor damage and its still advancing…in addition, from what I saw, the angel has artificial intelligence capacity…According to the MAGI system's analysis I observed before I left, it's not powered or manipulated by remote control. The angel seems to be a form of giant intelligent life. All of its actions are determined by its programs. That's not what I'm worried about though… the new pilot…his own son…how will he convince him?  
初号机目前正在冷却中，处于防御阵型 B…随时可以重新启动…那么 N2 炸弹对使徒无效…它只受到了轻微损伤，仍在前进…此外，据我所见，使徒具备人工智能能力…根据我离开前观察的 MAGI 系统分析，它并非由远程控制或电力驱动。使徒似乎是一种巨型智能生命体。其所有行动均由其程序决定。但这不是我担心的…新驾驶员…他自己的儿子…他该如何说服他？_

Suddenly she stopped the water craft as they sidled next to a platform, both of them slowly rising and stepping onto it, into the relative darkness.  
突然，她停下了水上交通工具，当他们靠近一个平台时，两人缓缓上升并踏上去，进入了相对的黑暗中。

Ritsuko glanced at the boy, trying to keep on her smile.  
律子瞥了一眼那个男孩，努力保持着微笑。

"Well, we're here. This is it. It's dark though, so watch your step."  
“好了，我们到了。就是这里。虽然很暗，小心脚下。”

Shinji stumbled backwards as he entered, standing before a monstrous, almost demonic gigantic metal face, staring at him, with a great protruding horn. It scared him and at the same time made him feel oddly safe.  
真嗣一进门就踉跄后退，眼前是一张巨大而近乎恶魔般的金属面孔，瞪着他，上面还突出一根巨大的角。这让他感到恐惧，同时又奇异地觉得安心。

"Th-This thing…Is that the robot that saved us earlier!"  
“这、这东西……难道就是之前救了我们的机器人！”

Shinji began rapidly leafing through the NERV book he had been given, but Ritsuko just laughed.  
真嗣开始迅速翻阅他拿到的那本 NERV 手册，但律子只是笑了笑。

"You won't find this in that manual."  
"你在这手册里可找不到这个。"

"Huh?" "啊？"

"And strictly speaking she's not a robot…She's a man-made, all-purpose battle weapon! Artificial Human Evangelion! And this is the last chance for humanity…The first unit of the Evangelion."  
"严格来说，她不是机器人……她是人造的万能战斗兵器！人造人型决战兵器！这是人类最后的希望……初号机。"

Shinji gazed at it in awe, and then frowned.  
真嗣敬畏地凝视着它，随后皱起了眉头。

"So this is all part of…my father's work?"  
“所以这一切都是……我父亲的成果？”

Ritsuko nodded. 律子点了点头。

"That's right." “没错。”

They suddenly felt another rumble hit the base and struggled to regain their balance as Ritsuko peered at her watch.  
他们突然感觉到基地再次震动，努力恢复平衡，而律子则盯着她的手表。

_Dammit, isn't he supposed to be making his appearance yet! He's the one who's supposed to tell him…  
该死，他不是应该出现了吗！他才是应该告诉他的人……_

Shinji turned to her, sighing.  
真嗣转向她，叹了口气。

"So…where is father?" “那么……父亲在哪里？”

Ritsuko turned away, looking down the catwalk and around the chambers, then back at Shinji.  
律子转过身去，目光沿着通道扫视着各个舱室，然后又回头看向真嗣。

"I…I don't know." "我…我不知道。"

Shinji turned away, folding his arms across his chest and frowning.  
真嗣转过身去，双臂交叉抱在胸前，皱起了眉头。

"Why did he call me here anyway?"  
"他到底为什么要叫我过来？"

Ritsuko frowned, peering at Shinji's back as the building shook around them yet again, and sighed.  
律子皱起眉头，盯着真嗣的背影，建筑物再次在他们周围摇晃，她叹了口气。

Suddenly her cell phone rang and she backed away, answering it in whispers.  
突然，她的手机响了，她退后几步，低声接听。

"Yes…hello Commander…Yes…I…But…Why are you…the angel is…it's too late for you to…But I can't…fine, fine…yes sir."  
“是……您好，司令……是……我……但是……您为什么……天使正在……现在您来……但我不能……好吧，好吧……是，长官。”

Ritsuko grumbled to herself, almost throwing the phone onto the ground.  
律子咕哝着，差点把手机扔到地上。

_Goddamit! That pig! He wants me to convince his son to pilot the Evangelion! How the hell am I going to-  
该死！那头猪！他想让我说服他儿子去驾驶 EVA！我到底该怎么——_

Another explosion up above shook the structure to its core, and Shinji frowned as he stumbled around.  
又一声爆炸从上方传来，震得整个建筑都在颤抖，真嗣皱着眉头踉跄了几步。

Ritsuko stumbled forward, tripping as a small piece of rubble fell behind her, and nearly tripped into he water, until she found something had stopped her.  
律子踉跄着向前，一块小碎石在她身后落下，她差点跌入水中，直到某种东西阻止了她。

Shinji blushed slightly as he helped her back up, and then frowned as he noticed the serious look on her face. She spoke softly in almost caring and slow whispers.  
真嗣帮她站起来时脸微微一红，随即皱起眉头，注意到她严肃的表情。她轻声细语，几乎是用关怀而缓慢的低语说道。

"Shinji…I need you to listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you…You…You're going to ride in her."  
“真嗣……我需要你仔细听我接下来要告诉你的话……你……你要驾驶她。”

Shinji's eyes widened and he pushed Ritsuko away, staring at her.  
真嗣的眼睛睁大了，他推开律子，盯着她。

"Wha!" “什！”

She continued to move towards him, speaking in a low tone.  
她继续向他靠近，用低沉的声音说道。

"You're going to battle the angel…You have to, Shinji…You're our only hope."  
"你要去与天使战斗……你必须去，真嗣……你是我们唯一的希望。"

Shinji continued to move backwards, shaking his heads and clenching his fists.  
真嗣继续后退，摇着头，紧握双拳。

"No…No! My father called me all the way over here to die! You're saying I'm…I…I'm going to ride in this thing…to fight that monster we saw? Y-You're kidding, right? There's no way I can do something like that!"  
"不……不！我父亲把我叫到这里来送死！你是说我……我……我要坐进这东西里……去对抗我们见过的那个怪物？你……你在开玩笑吧？我绝对做不到那种事！"

Ritsuko tried to move closer to him as the rubble poured down towards them, as Shinji cowered away.  
碎石如雨般倾泻而下，Ritsuko 试图靠近他，而 Shinji 却畏缩着躲开。

"Shinji, please, you're the best candidate…no, the only candidate we have left. The fate of the world rests in your hands…"  
“Shinji，拜托了，你是最佳人选…不，是我们仅剩的唯一人选。世界的命运掌握在你手中…”

"But why me! It doesn't make sense! No! There's no way…I can't ride in that thing! Is that why my father called me here? To order me to my death?"  
“但为什么是我！这说不通！不！我绝不可能…坐上那东西！这就是我父亲叫我来的原因吗？命令我去送死？”

"Shinji…no…Your father couldn't make it…he's…in the NERV hospital…he's hurt…He called you here because he may be dying and he wanted to see you one last time."  
"真嗣…不…你父亲没能赶来…他在 NERV 医院…他受伤了…他叫你来是因为他可能快要不行了，他想在最后见你一面。"

Ritsuko winced as she spoke those words, because she could see the hope and sadness in Shinji's deep eyes.  
说这些话时，律子皱了皱眉，因为她能从真嗣深邃的眼眸中看到希望与悲伤。

_If a lie can save the world…It's my duty…but why do I feel so…horrible…  
如果一个谎言能拯救世界…这是我的职责…但为什么我感到如此…糟糕…_

She finally reached the trembling boy, placing a hand on his shoulder.  
她终于走到了那个颤抖的男孩身边，将手轻轻放在他的肩上。

"Shinji, if you don't get in and pilot it, humanity will perish, all of it. The very existence of the human race rests on your shoulders. And your father will be there, watching, proud of you, waiting for you to come so he can congratulate you. He's changed Shinji, he's changed."  
"真嗣，如果你不进入驾驶舱并启动它，人类将会灭亡，全部都会。人类的存在完全取决于你。你的父亲会在那里，看着你，为你感到骄傲，等待着你去接受他的祝贺。他变了，真嗣，他变了。"

Shinji turned away, tears flowing down his face as he stared at a distant point in the ceiling.  
真嗣转过身去，泪水顺着脸颊滑落，他凝视着天花板上的某个遥远点。

"_No! Where's mamma! Don't leave me! Please! Stop it! No!"_  
“不！妈妈在哪里！不要离开我！求求你！停下来！不！”

"_Shinji…you know she's dead…You saw it yourself."_  
"真嗣…你知道她已经去世了…你自己亲眼看到的。"

"_No! No! You're lying! Momma? Momma!"_  
"不！不！你在撒谎！妈妈？妈妈！"

Shinji remained silent and Ritsuko stared at him, unsure of what to say, when all of a sudden there was a great metal clanging above them, the structure shaking violently.  
真嗣保持沉默，而律子盯着他，不知该说什么，突然间上方传来巨大的金属撞击声，整个结构剧烈摇晃。

"W-What's that noise!" "那是什么声音！"

Ritsuko spun around, releasing her hold on Shinji.  
律子猛地转身，放开了对真嗣的控制。

"The angel! It's discovered our location!"  
"是使徒！它发现了我们的位置！"

Gendo Ikari stared with determination at the great black monstrosity as it stalked forward and then stopped, a great flashing light erupting from its chest.  
碇源堂坚定地凝视着那巨大的黑色怪物缓缓逼近，随即停下，其胸口爆发出耀眼的闪光。

The light seemed to bounce forward, and then almost skip from explosion to explosion until it hit its target, causing an enormous cylindrical explosion, almost like a mushroom cloud.  
那光芒仿佛向前弹射，随后几乎跳跃般从一处爆炸传至另一处，直至击中目标，引发了一场巨大的圆柱形爆炸，宛如一朵蘑菇云。

Ritsuko peered around frantically as the ground around them began to shake, clouds of dust flying down upon them, and then she noticed something worse.  
律子慌乱地环顾四周，地面开始震动，尘土飞扬，随后她注意到了更糟糕的事情。

"Shinji! Get down! The city blocks on the ceiling of the dome are starting to fa-"  
“真嗣！快趴下！穹顶天花板上的城市街区开始崩塌——”

"Look out!" “小心！”

She let out a choking noise as a chunk of rock hit her on the back and stumbled forward, Shinji running towards her and stopping her from falling completely.  
她被一块岩石击中背部，发出窒息般的声响，踉跄向前，真嗣朝她跑来，及时扶住了她，没让她完全跌倒。

She groaned in her arms, disorientated, muttering to herself.  
她在他的怀里呻吟，感到头晕目眩，喃喃自语。

"Ikari…Ikari…" “碇……碇……”

Shinji shook her, his face concerned.  
真嗣摇晃着她，脸上满是关切。

"Hang in there!" “坚持住！”

_I can't believe it…I can't let this place crumble down around us…it's just…I…Father.  
我简直不敢相信……我不能让这个地方在我们周围崩塌……只是……我……父亲。_

Ritsuko stared up at the shadowy face above her, the trimmed outline of Gendo Ikari, although something seemed different about him.  
律子抬头凝视着那张阴影中的面孔，那是加持良治修剪整齐的轮廓，尽管他似乎有些不同。

She reached out and caressed his face, confused about the fact that he had no beard, and then darkness enveloped her.  
她伸出手轻抚他的脸颊，困惑于他竟然没有胡须，随后黑暗吞噬了她。

Shinji stumbled away with a gasp and then a blush as Ritsuko's smooth hand ran across his face and then fell to her side as she passed out. The son of Ikari then turned away, muttering to himself, dried tears beneath his eyes.  
真嗣惊喘一声，随即脸颊泛红，踉跄后退，因为律子光滑的手掌拂过他的脸庞，然后垂落身侧，她随即昏迷过去。加持的儿子转过身去，自言自语，眼角残留着干涸的泪痕。

He clenched his fists as he stared at the Evangelion.  
他紧握双拳，凝视着那台福音战士。

"All right, I just have to get in it…that's all…I'll…I'll do it."  
“好吧，我只需要坐进去……就这样……我会……我会做到的。”

Well, that's all for the second chapter…  
嗯，这就是第二章的全部内容了……

And yes! This is a Shinji/Rei fic, dammit! Just be patient! I know this seems more like Shinji/Ritsuko right now (Which would be interesting and tantalizing), but it's officially Shinji/Rei! So wait for it!  
没错！这确实是一篇真嗣/丽的故事，该死的！耐心点！我知道现在看起来更像真嗣/律子（那也会很有趣且撩人心弦），但官方配对是真嗣/丽！所以等着瞧吧！

Hope you liked this chapter though…A bit weird, a bit odd, indeed…But hopefully you liked it. Well, see you next chapter, and remember, read _and_ review!  
希望你喜欢这个chapter……虽然有点奇怪，确实有点古怪……但愿你喜欢。那么，下次chapter见，记得阅读并留下评论！

### Chapter 3 The Folly of the King
Well, hope you're enjoying this fanfic as well as my other many fanfics…Maybe I've made way too many…eh…who cares…  
嗯，希望你也在享受这篇同人文，还有我其他众多的作品……或许我写得太多了……呃……谁在乎呢……

Anyway, sorry for taking ages with the update, I was busy, bored, tired, and out of Writing Mode. :)  
总之，很抱歉更新拖了这么久，我忙、无聊、累，还不在写作状态。 :)  

Disclaimer: I don't own Evangelion or its characters. Gainax does, and they rock. Who else could create both Evangelion and FLCL!  
声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》或其角色。这些属于 GAINAX，他们很棒。还有谁能创造出《新世纪福音战士》和《FLCL》呢！

Shinji Ikari stared up at the Evangelion in determination, and then suddenly sighed. He realized that despite his sudden agreement with Ritsuko's entreaties, she was now unconscious and he hadn't any idea how to board this giant monster she called an Evangelion.  
碇真嗣坚定地凝视着眼前的 EVA，随即突然叹了口气。他意识到，尽管自己突然同意了赤木律子的恳求，但她现在昏迷不醒，而他根本不知道如何登上这个她称之为 EVA 的巨型怪物。

He clenched his eyes tight in confusion and fear and tried to focus on the faces of his mother and father, together, a couple, smiling happily.  
他紧闭双眼，困惑与恐惧交织，努力集中精神，想象着父母在一起，一对夫妇，幸福地微笑着。

Ritsuko's words were still haunting him with a horrifically sublime sense of hope.  
律子的言语依旧萦绕在他心头，带着一种恐怖而崇高的希望感。

"_Shinji…no…Your father couldn't make it…he's…in the NERV hospital…he's hurt…He called you here because he may be dying and he wanted to see you one last time."_  
"真嗣…不…你父亲没能赶来…他在 NERV 医院…他受伤了…他叫你来是因为他可能快要不行了，他想在最后见你一面。"

Maya typed frantically on her keyboard, her face a visage of horror and seriousness.  
玛雅在键盘上疯狂地敲击着，她的脸上满是惊恐与严肃。

"Critical damage to surface level! The Angel is trying to blow itself a passage down to the Control Room itself! It's directly above us!"  
表面层受到严重破坏！使徒正试图为自己炸开一条通往中央控制室的路！它就在我们正上方！

Gendo Ikari stumbled about as dust from the shaking ceiling flitted down, and Misato's face twisted into confusion at the base's sudden helplessness. They truly hadn't any weapons left.  
碇源堂踉跄着，天花板震落的灰尘纷纷扬扬，美里脸上露出困惑，基地的突然无助让她感到不解。他们真的没有任何武器剩下了。

"I think we can see that, Maya…How much time do we have?"  
“我想我们能看出来，摩耶……我们还有多少时间？”

Maya seemed uneasy and then finally spoke, her voice wavering.  
摩耶显得不安，最终开口，声音颤抖。

"Ten minutes…approximately…probably less…"  
“十分钟……大概……可能更短……”

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Unknown Location  
NERV 总部，未知地点**

Shinji Ikari stared at Evangelion Unit 01 with fear and determination, the robot or monster or whatever it was, vaguely threatening to him, especially because he hadn't any idea how to board it and the place around him was crumbling.  
碇真嗣盯着 Evangelion 初号机，心中既害怕又坚定，这台机器人或怪物，或任何它所是的东西，对他来说隐约带有威胁，尤其是因为他完全不知道如何登上去，而周围的环境正在崩塌。

Couple that with the fact that Ritsuko Akagi was still out cold, prone down below and Shinji Ikari's mind was racing with chaos and confusion.  
再加上赤木律子仍然昏迷不醒，躺在下面，碇真嗣的脑海中充满了混乱和困惑。

_Gendo Ikari stared down at his son, shaking his head.  
碇源堂低头盯着他的儿子，摇了摇头。_

"_You…disappoint me."_ “你……让我失望了。”

Shinji clenched his fists, shouting out towards the Evangelion with almost a strained roar.  
真嗣紧握双拳，几乎是用尽全力地向着 Evangelion 吼叫。

"Dammit! What am I supposed to do?"  
"该死！我该怎么办？"

Suddenly a large rumble shook the catwalk and designated Third Child stumbled backwards, actually thinking for a second in fear that the Evangelion had come alive to attack him.  
突然，一阵巨大的轰鸣声震动了走道，指定的第三适格者踉跄后退，一时间竟害怕地以为 EVA 活了过来要攻击他。

Instead, a huge, threatening, but at the same time vaguely welcoming pod was now protruding out of the Evangelion, directly in front of Shinji Ikari.  
然而，一个巨大、威胁性十足，却又隐约带着欢迎意味的驾驶舱此刻正从 EVA 中伸出，直接出现在碇真嗣面前。

The young man stared into the strange darkness of the entry plug and shuddered, stepping inside with his eyes and fists clenched unbelievably tight.  
年轻人凝视着驾驶舱内那诡异的黑暗，不禁打了个寒颤，他紧闭双眼、握紧双拳，难以置信地踏了进去。

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

Maya gasped, typing rapidly on her keyboard as the ground around them shook, dust floating down from the ceiling, countless screens simply erupting into static.  
玛雅倒抽一口气，手指在键盘上飞速敲击，周围的地面震动着，尘埃从天花板飘落，无数屏幕突然爆发出静电噪声。

"The Komagatake defense line has been broken..."  
“驹岳防线已被突破……”

"All layers from first to eighteenth damaged!"  
"从第一层到第十八层全部受损！"

Misato gasped. 美里倒吸一口凉气。

"Can its blast really be capable of that sort of power! Its attack broke through eighteen special armor plates at once!"  
"它的爆炸真的能有那种威力吗？一次攻击就击穿了十八层特殊装甲板！"

Kouzou stared at Gendo, wondering what plan the younger man had up his sleeve.  
高雄盯着源度，想知道这个年轻人葫芦里卖的是什么药。

_We've lost communication with both your lover and your son...Do you even care, Gendo Ikari? No…I suppose you don't  
我们失去了与你爱人和你儿子的联系……你真的在乎吗，源度·碇？不……我想你并不在乎。_

Suddenly the control room shook once more, this time as something actually came out of NERV Headquarters and out into the surface, instead of the other way around. A purple mechanical blur.  
突然间，控制室再次震动，这次是有什么东西从 NERV 总部内部冲出，来到了地表，而非相反。一个紫色的机械模糊身影。

Evangelion Unit 01 landed next to the gaping hole created by the solemn angel and seemed to stare it down, hunched over in a predatory stance.  
福音战士初号机降落在庄严天使所造成的巨大裂口旁，仿佛在凝视着它，以一种捕食者的姿态弓身而立。

The control room seemed to let out a collective gasp as they all scrambled about and typed, trying to recover data on the situation and the pilot outside.  
控制室里似乎传来了一阵集体的惊呼，所有人都在忙碌地敲打着键盘，试图恢复关于当前情况和外部驾驶员的数据。

Only Gendo Ikari remained unchanged, staring forward at the screen presenting the calm before a horrendous battle, a smirk splayed across his face.  
只有碇源堂依旧面不改色，凝视着屏幕上大战前的平静，脸上挂着一抹冷笑。

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

Shinji strained at the controls, his hands shaking as he peered around the entry plug.  
真嗣紧握操纵杆，双手颤抖着环顾插入栓内部。

First he'd almost drowned in the liquid inside, or so he'd thought, then he'd managed to somehow get the giant bulking monster to the surface. Now it seemed not to respond as he inanely and intensely punched and jerked with the controls, simply crouching there silently, staring at the ominous looking angel, which quite frankly, terrified even someone as apathetic as Shinji Ikari.  
起初他差点在内部的液体中溺水，或者说他以为是这样，然后他设法让这个庞大的怪物浮出水面。现在它似乎对真嗣徒劳而激烈地敲打和拉动操纵杆毫无反应，只是静静地蹲在那里，凝视着那个看起来不祥的天使，坦白说，即使是对真嗣·碇这样冷漠的人来说，也感到恐惧。

Suddenly he heard a voice waft into his cockpit and he shook, utterly startled, the voice strained and feminine.  
突然，他听到一个声音飘进驾驶舱，他惊慌失措地颤抖着，那声音紧张而女性化。

"Shinji Ikari, do you copy?"  
"碇真嗣，你能听到吗？"

Shinji paused and then sighed, replying awkwardly.  
真嗣停顿了一下，然后叹了口气，尴尬地回答。

"Yeah…" "嗯…"

"Okay Shinji…I need you to listen to me, alright…We don't have much time for a crash course in piloting."  
"好的，真嗣……我需要你听我说，好吗……我们没有太多时间来进行驾驶的速成课程了。"

The angel stood eerily dormant, staring at the Evangelion with its odd eyes.  
天使静静地站立着，用它那奇异的眼睛凝视着福音战士。

"Shinji…you need to understand the neural, the mental connection, you could say, with your Evangelion…If you want to walk, think only of walking…clear your mind…"  
"真嗣……你需要理解与你的福音战士之间的神经连接，可以说是精神上的联系……如果你想走动，只需想着走动……清空你的思绪……"

Shinji squinted his eyes and spoke as the Evangelion began to warily make its way forward.  
真嗣眯起眼睛，当 EVA 开始小心翼翼地向前移动时说道。

"Walk…" “走……”

The Evangelion tripped forward, awkwardly and anticlimactically, slamming down and barely supporting itself with its hands, as if by reflex.  
EVA 向前绊了一下，笨拙且虎头蛇尾地，猛地摔倒，几乎本能地用手支撑住自己。

But the moment was a loss, the angel charged forward like a blur, trying to take advantage of the Evangelion's loss of balance.  
但那一刻已成败局，天使如影随形般疾冲向前，试图利用福音战士失去平衡的瞬间。

"No! Dammit! Shinji, remember, that's not your arm! It's not your arm!"  
“不！该死！真嗣，记住，那不是你的手臂！那不是你的手臂！”

Shinji groaned as the angel slammed against him, the Evangelion's right arm straining as Shinji tried to throw his attacker off, almost controlling the Evangelion effortlessly in a time of reflex and danger.  
真嗣呻吟着，天使猛烈撞击着他，福音战士的右臂在真嗣试图甩开攻击者时紧绷，几乎在反射与危险的时刻中毫不费力地控制住了福音战士。

He swung a fist up against the angel's bulk, slamming it away, and then rose up with a roar, the Evangelion mirroring him even to the roar.  
他挥拳猛击天使的庞大身躯，将其击退，随即怒吼着站起，福音战士也如影随形，连怒吼都如出一辙。

Evangelion Unit 01 charged towards the angel as it seemed to struggle to rise. Instead it raised one of its long arms towards the charging Evangelion before it could arrive.  
福音战士 01 号向着似乎挣扎着想要起身的使徒冲去。然而，在它到达之前，使徒抬起了一只长臂，迎向冲锋的福音战士。

Suddenly there was a flash, then simply darkness.  
突然间光芒一闪，随后便是一片漆黑。

---

_Shinji Ikari screamed, staring out into the grueling darkness around him, hearing moaning and screaming and suddenly feeling a numb but strong pain on the left side of his head.  
碇真嗣尖叫着，凝视着四周严酷的黑暗，听到呻吟和尖叫声，突然感到头部左侧一阵麻木却强烈的疼痛。_

_Stumbling backwards, or maybe more like floating backwards, he saw her, like an angel, indeed with angelic wings, floating above him, bringing light to the squirming black all around him.  
他踉跄后退，或者更像是漂浮后退，看到了她，宛如天使，确实带着天使般的翅膀，悬浮在他上方，为周围蠕动的黑暗带来光明。_

_I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die… I don't wanna die…I don't want to…Mother!  
我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想死……我不想……妈妈！_

---

Evangelion Unit 01 sprang up in a purple flash, startling everyone, from Misato and the control room, to even the pilot and the angel standing in front of it. On the left side of its face was a smoking hole, from where Sachiel's energy beam had slammed into Evangelion Unit 01's face.  
初号机在一片紫色闪光中猛然站起，惊动了从美里和指挥室到甚至站在它面前的驾驶员和使徒的每一个人。它的左脸颊上有一个冒烟的洞，正是萨基尔的能量光束击中初号机脸部的位置。

Misato's voice came wafting into the entry plug, and she seemed horrendously worried.  
美里的声音飘进了插入栓，她似乎极度担忧。

"Sh-Shinji…That's not your….that's…that's…"  
“真-真嗣…那不是你的…那是…那是…”

Shinji Ikari felt a drop of blood fall into his lap and looked up, suddenly noticing the horrendous pain in his left eye, and then realizing half of his vision was bathed into darkness.  
碇真嗣感觉到一滴血落在了他的大腿上，抬头一看，突然注意到左眼传来可怕的疼痛，然后意识到自己的一半视野陷入了黑暗。

He tried to open his left eye, move it around, blink, and slowly brought up his right hand, touching against his left eye, curiously.  
他试图睁开左眼，转动它，眨眼，慢慢地举起右手，好奇地触摸着左眼。

Where the Third Child's eye would usually be was a mangled socket of blood and fluid, dripping down his face.  
第三少年原本眼睛所在的地方，现在是一个血肉模糊的空洞，血和液体顺着脸颊滴落。

Shinji Ikari stared up to the heavens, his single eye bulging, and let out a horrifying scream, a bestial shriek that echoed throughout the Evangelion.  
碇真嗣抬头望向天空，他那只独眼瞪得大大的，发出一声恐怖的尖叫，那野兽般的嘶吼在整个福音战士中回荡。

Then, he was bathed in light.  
随后，他被光芒笼罩。

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Control Room  
NERV 总部，控制室**

Misato felt a shiver run up her spine as Shinji's scream echoed throughout the control room, fresh and horrifying as if he were right there beside him.  
当真嗣的尖叫声在控制室中回荡时，美里感到一阵寒意沿着脊背升起，那声音新鲜而恐怖，仿佛他就站在她身边一样。

"Front area of the head cracked!"  
"前额区域破裂！"

"Head damaged; extent unknown!"  
"头部受损，程度不明！"

"Control nerves snapping one after another."  
"控制神经一根接一根断裂。"

"No response from pilot."  
"飞行员无回应。"

All of the control room was silent, everyone with shocked and miserable looks on their faces, even the Sub-Commander, who had a wizened look of sublime sadness splayed across his face.  
控制室内一片死寂，每个人的脸上都写满了震惊与悲痛，就连副指挥官也露出了沧桑而深沉的哀伤神情。

"Pilot's brain waves are erratic. Heart beat is very weak."  
"飞行员的脑电波紊乱，心率极其微弱。"

"Heart support system to maximum. Begin cardiac stimulation."  
"心脏支持系统调至最大。开始心脏刺激。"

"Roger…" "收到…"

"Pulse recognized…" "脉搏已识别…"

Maya typed rapidly at her console, her face horrified with worry.  
玛雅在控制台上快速打字，脸上满是担忧的惊恐。

"Trouble maintaining activity!"  
“活动维持出现困难！”

"What's the status?" “情况如何？”

"Synchrograph has reversed. Pulses are flowing backward!"  
"同步图反转了。脉冲正在逆流！"

"Cut the circuits! Stop them!"  
"切断电路！阻止它们！"

No use! The signal is refused. It can't be received!  
没用的！信号被拒绝了。无法接收！

"No response from the monitoring system. Life or death unknown!"  
"监控系统无回应。生死未卜！"

"Unit 01 is totally silent."  
"初号机完全静默。"

Misato sighed, shaking her head, her face laced with worry.  
美里叹了口气，摇着头，脸上布满忧虑。

_So much for this time...father  
这次...父亲，就这样吧_

"Stop the operation. Pilot's protection has top priority. Eject the plug by force!"  
“停止操作。飞行员的安全最为优先。强制弹出插入栓！”

"Force eject the entry plug, hurry!"  
“强制弹出插入栓，快！”

"Denied. The pilot must remain under all circumstances; you forget the angel is currently invading our base. Locate the First Child for deployment"  
“否决。无论任何情况，驾驶员必须留守；你忘了天使正在入侵我们的基地吗？立即定位初号机准备出击。”

The Commander's voice interrupted coldly, and his ruthless order was followed without a noise of objection or reason, he had trained his subordinates well, even Misato remained dormant and confused.  
司令官的声音冷酷地打断了对话，他的无情命令被毫无异议地执行，没有一丝理由或反驳的声音。他训练下属有方，就连美里也保持着沉默，感到困惑。

Only Gendo Ikari seemed to remain the same, calm and silent.  
只有碇源堂似乎依旧保持平静，沉默不语。

Finally he spoke, ignoring the video screen as it showed Sachiel slamming into the dormant Evangelion Unit 01 and knocking it down onto the concrete. It loomed over the biomechanical menace, as if considering something, and then simply left it behind, leaping down into the gaping hole it made, shaking the entire NERV Base with its horrific entrance.  
最终，他开口了，无视着视频屏幕上萨奇尔猛烈撞击沉睡中的初号机并将其击倒在混凝土上的画面。它俯视着这个生物机械的威胁，仿佛在考虑着什么，然后就简单地离开了，跳进那个巨大的洞口，其可怕的进入方式震撼了整个 NERV 基地。

Gendo Ikari suddenly stood, staring at Kouzou and nodded, no secret message, simply handing over the command to the older man, Kouzou frankly had no idea why Ikari was leaving, but he hoped for the sake of humanity that there was a plan B.  
碇源堂突然站起身，盯着荒唐，点了点头，没有秘密信息，只是简单地将指挥权交给了年长的荒唐。荒唐确实不知道碇源堂为何离开，但他希望为了人类的利益，还有个 B 计划。

Ritsuko Akagi groaned as the ground shook, wiping the warm blood off her brow and struggling to become orientated with her surroundings. The base was certainly crumbling around her, and she could see huge gaping holes above her.  
赤木律子呻吟着，地面摇晃，她擦去额头的温热血液，努力适应周围的环境。基地确实在她周围崩塌，她能看到头顶上巨大的裂口。

_I wonder…what… 我在想……什么……_

Then she noticed that Evangelion Unit 01 was gone.  
然后她注意到，初号机不见了。

She smirked sadly and tried to stand up, noticing her phone was broken.  
她苦笑了一下，试图站起来，却发现手机已经坏了。

_So he really did it…he really had the guts to do it…I thought I'd imagined that last part as I went unconscious…  
所以他真的做到了……他真的有胆量去做……我以为我失去意识前的那部分是我想象出来的……_

_He clenched his fists as he stared at the Evangelion.  
他紧握双拳，凝视着那台福音战士。_

"_All right, I just have to get in it…that's all…I'll…I'll do it."_  
“好吧，我只需要坐进去……就这样……我会……我会做到的。”

The faux blonde sighed, remembering the boy's somber face, and what she had told him about his father. The little lie to save the whole of humanity…then why did it make her feel so disgusted?  
那个假金发女郎叹了口气，回想起男孩忧郁的脸庞，以及她对他父亲所说的话。那个为了拯救全人类的小谎言……可为什么它让她感到如此厌恶？

Ritsuko Akagi tried to tell herself that she would try to be kind to the young Ikari, treat him like a new friend, even if she were being fake, it was necessary for his mental stability and recovery, she had read his data file, after all…  
赤木律子试图告诉自己，她会尽量对年轻的碇真嗣友善，把他当作新朋友对待，即使她是假装的，这对他的心理稳定和恢复是必要的，毕竟她读过他的资料文件……

_Shinji Ikari groaned, feeling his entire body racked with pain, his soul with misery.  
碇真嗣呻吟着，感到全身疼痛难忍，灵魂深处满是痛苦。_

_He floated in the grayness now; the dark black abyss had been replaced with a gray numbness.  
他现在漂浮在这片灰色之中；那黑暗的深渊已被一种麻木的灰色所取代。_

_Shinji peered out from within the grayness, as a huge flash of light illuminated him. His pain was forgotten, his misery was numbed.  
真嗣从灰色中向外窥视，一道巨大的闪光照亮了他。疼痛被遗忘，痛苦也被麻木了。_

_There was only a surge of energy, familiar energy…someone who cared for him was close by.  
只有一股能量涌动，熟悉的能量……关心他的人就在附近。_

"_M-Mother?"_ “妈——妈妈？”

_Then a stronger burst of light, blinding his right eye momentarily, and then a feeling of…  
接着是一阵更强烈的光芒，短暂地刺瞎了他的右眼，然后是一种……_

Shinji Ikari spoke only four words as the Evangelion slowly sprang up, as the light washed through his body, a pulsing that was different from the beating of his heart in his bloodied head.  
碇真嗣只说了四个字，当 EVA 缓缓启动时，光芒穿透他的身体，一种与心跳不同的脉动在他血迹斑斑的头部回荡。

"I…love you too…" “我……也爱你……”

A bestial roar echoed throughout the control room as Evangelion Unit 01 sprang to life, its nefarious eyes glowing, its legs straining as it sprang down into the great yawning that Sachiel had entered through.  
EVA 初号机猛然苏醒，发出野兽般的咆哮，控制室内回荡着这声怒吼，它那不祥的眼睛闪烁着光芒，双腿奋力一跃，冲进了萨基尔进入的那个巨大的裂口。

The final battle had come.  
最终之战已经来临。

Well, hope you liked this chapter…a little short, and a little odd, perhaps ,but still alright, they'll get longer as we go around…And _yes_ you'll meet Rei, obviously, eventually, this is a Rei/Shinji fanfic, after all…  
嗯，希望你喜欢这个chapter……可能有点短，也有点奇怪，但还算不错，随着我们继续，它们会变得更长……而且没错，你最终会遇到丽，显然，毕竟这是丽/真嗣的同人文……

Well, anyway, see you next chapter.  
总之，下次chapter见。

### Chapter 4 The Triumph of the King
Long time no update…Sorry if this one seems rusty, I haven't updated anything for ages.  
好久没更新了……如果这篇显得生疏，请见谅，我已经很久没更新任何内容了。

But I have a new fanfic out, Neon Genesis Evangelion: Memento Mori, and I've been feeling in a writing mood because of that, so hopefully I'll maintain and update all of my numerous fanfictions. Hooray!  
不过我新出了一篇同人小说《新世纪福音战士：纪念品》，因为这个我写作的心情大好，所以希望我能保持并更新我所有的众多同人作品。万岁！

As for those who're saying, "Rei/Shinji! There's no Rei at all!", yeah, I know, this may seem Ritsuko/Shinji or Shinji/Nothing, but this is just the beginning dudes. I had nowhere I felt like putting Rei in. Obviously Shinji will get to meet her soon and etc., just have patience. Heh.  
至于那些说“丽/真嗣！这里根本没有丽！”的人，是的，我知道，这看起来可能是律子/真嗣或者真嗣/无，但这只是开始，伙计们。我没有找到合适的地方让丽出现。显然，真嗣很快就会遇到她等等，请耐心等待。呵呵。

By the way, if anyone's confused about my format, italics are used purely for inner thoughts/flashbacks. For example in Gendo's part, that is his mind's content, i.e. flashbacks and thoughts. As for the surreal Sachiel and Shinji scenes, those obviously aren't flashbacks…  
顺便说一下，如果有人对我的格式感到困惑，斜体字纯粹用于内心想法/闪回。例如在源堂的部分，那是他的内心内容，即闪回和想法。至于超现实的萨基尔和真嗣的场景，那些显然不是闪回……

---

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

Shinji Ikari's body pulsed with energy in the shimmering glow of his Evangelion Unit.  
碇真嗣的身体在闪耀的 EVA 初号机光芒中充满了能量。

He felt nothing but the thirst, the rage, and…something familiar…someone.  
他只感到渴求、愤怒，以及……某种熟悉的感觉……某个人。

It bathed over his aching eye and shattered body, and he reached out in pure hatred at the massive creature he was fighting, only to find himself lost in a flash of light.  
这感觉覆盖了他疼痛的眼睛和破碎的身体，他在纯粹的憎恨中向着正在战斗的巨大生物伸出手，却发现自己迷失在一道闪光之中。

_A blinding light, a shadowy form in front of his vision, Shinji disorientated.  
一道刺眼的光芒，视线前方是模糊的阴影，真嗣感到一阵眩晕。_

"_Why do you wish to fight me, Lillim?"_  
“你为何想与我战斗，莉莉姆？”

_Shinji Ikari stared up at the feminine form as it became clear, his eyes widening in confusion.  
碇真嗣抬头凝视着那逐渐清晰的女子身影，眼中满是困惑。_

_She was a young woman with brilliant cyan hair and radiant wings, along with odd armor covering her semi-nude body and glimmering red eyes.  
她是一位拥有亮丽青蓝发色和耀眼羽翼的年轻女子，奇特的盔甲覆盖着她半裸的身体，闪烁着红光的双眼熠熠生辉。_

_Yet he knew in his soul who she was.  
然而，他的灵魂深处知道她是谁。_

"_Because…I have to…My father…needs me…It is important. I am useful."_  
“因为…我必须…我的父亲…需要我…这很重要。我有用。”

"_And you would be willing to risk your life for that, Lillim?"_  
"而你愿意为此冒生命危险吗，莉莉姆？"

He stared at Sachiel and roared as he felt a surge of energy rush through his head, clutching his skull and screaming as he reached out of this deluge.  
他盯着萨奇尔，随着一股能量涌入脑海，他咆哮着，紧抓头骨，尖叫着从这片洪流中伸出手来。

"I HAVE NO CHOICE!" "我别无选择！"

Evangelion Unit 01 reached out as well, slamming in a hard tackle into the angel, driving both huge forms down the massive shaft towards NERV central, Shinji's screams echoing.  
福音战士初号机也伸出了手，猛地一记重击撞向使徒，将两个巨大的身躯沿着巨大的竖井推向 NERV 总部，真嗣的尖叫声回荡着。

NERV 总部，控制室**

Misato hurried to the controls, her eyes flitting back and forth as technicians rushed to and fro.  
美里急忙赶到控制台前，她的目光来回扫视，技术人员们匆忙地跑来跑去。

"What is the status of the Unit! What's going on!"  
“初号机的情况如何！发生了什么！”

Maya gasped. 玛雅倒抽了一口气。

"Impossible. It's totally out of control!"  
"不可能。完全失控了！"

"Direct hit to the third foundation!"  
"直接击中了第三根基柱！"

"Final armor plate fused..."  
"最终装甲板融合..."

Maya's eyes widened. 真矢的眼睛睁大了。

"It's no good. The main shaft is exposed!"  
"不行了，主轴暴露了！"

Misato whirled around quickly, gasping.  
美里迅速转身，倒吸一口气。

"The targets have entered the main shaft! They're descending!"  
“目标已进入主井道！正在下降！”

"What is its destination?"  
“它的目的地是哪里？”

"Advancing directly to Central Dogma…"  
"直接前往中心法则……"

"It's coming here. All personnel, evacuate. Quickly!"  
"它正朝这里来。所有人员，立即撤离。快！"

Makoto nodded promptly echoing Katsuragi's order.  
真琴立刻点头，重复了克图格亚的命令。

"All personnel evacuate. Repeat; all personnel evacuate."  
"所有人员撤离。重复；所有人员撤离。"

Shinji Ikari screamed as the Evangelion and Angel tumbled down, trying to reach out and attack the Angel.  
碇真嗣尖叫着，随着初号机与使徒一同坠落，试图伸出攻击使徒。

"Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, please move! If you don't move now, if I don't do it now, everyone's going to die! Not like this! Not with my father watching! MOVE!"  
"动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来，请动起来！如果你现在不动，如果我现在不做，所有人都会死！不是这样！不是在我父亲看着的情况下！动起来！"

"_Why do you seek his approval, Lillim?"_  
"你为何寻求他的认可，莉莉姆？"

_Sachiel stared at him, smiling sadly.  
萨基尔盯着他，悲伤地微笑着。_

"_Shut up! Shut up! You're not real! You're not human! You're…the Angel…"_  
"闭嘴！闭嘴！你不是真的！你不是人类！你是……天使……"

_Sachiel shook her head. 萨基尔摇了摇头。_

"_You do not comprehend us Lillim, being of the 18th. However that is fine…for now."_  
"你们这些第 18 位的莉莉姆，无法理解我们。不过没关系……现在而已。"

_She shook her cyan-haired head, her radiant wings spreading as she reached behind her back and drew a large sword that seemed to be comprised of bone.  
她摇了摇她那蓝绿色的头发，光芒四射的翅膀随之展开，她伸手到背后，抽出了一把看似由骨头构成的大剑。_

"_Memento…mori."_ “勿忘你终有一死。”

"_What!"_ "什么！"

_Shinji looked up just as she slammed the sword at his gut.  
真嗣抬头一看，她已经将剑猛地劈向他的腹部。_

"Impossible, I can't believe it. The synchro-rate of Unit One is over 400!"  
"不可能，我简直不敢相信。初号机的同步率超过了 400！"

Kouzou arched his gray eyebrows in surprise, staring at the technicians rushing to and fro, Maya speaking up in surprise as she typed away at her keyboard.  
源堂扬起灰白的眉毛，惊讶地盯着那些忙碌穿梭的技术人员，律子一边敲打着键盘，一边惊讶地开口。

"No! How can it be moving!"  
"不！怎么可能动起来！"

Misato gasped. 美里倒吸一口凉气。

"It…can't be…" "这…不可能…"

"Gone wild!" "失控了！"

Kouzou smirked, wondering if Gendo was enjoying the show, wherever he was.  
高雄冷笑一声，不知道源堂在哪儿是否也在欣赏这场表演。

"We…will win." “我们…会赢。”

_The blade hurtled forward, and then stopped, something hindering its forward motion.  
刀刃疾飞向前，随即停住，某种事物阻碍了它的前进。_

_Sachiel's eyes opened wide and she hissed in surprise at fate's betrayal.  
萨奇埃尔的眼睛睁得大大的，她因命运的背叛而惊讶地嘶嘶作声。_

_A brilliant glow surrounded the cowering young man, a glowing human form radiating him, the form of a young woman with brilliant eyes.  
一团耀眼的光芒环绕着蜷缩的年轻人，一个发光的人形笼罩着他，那是一个有着明亮眼睛的年轻女子。_

"_Mother…"_ “母亲…”

"_Impossible! No Lillim is capable of this!"_  
“不可能！没有哪个莉莉姆能做到这一点！”

_Shinji Ikari rose, the blazing femine form behind him seeming to fuel a new fire in his soul, and his eyes, oh his cerulean eyes, now swirling with a look of defiant anger.  
碇真嗣站起身来，身后那炽热的女性身影仿佛在他灵魂中点燃了新的火焰，而他的双眼，哦，他那蔚蓝的双眼，此刻正翻涌着一种挑衅的愤怒。_

"_Don't call me that! My name is Shinji Ikari! Don't you ever call me anything else!"_  
“别那样叫我！我的名字是碇真嗣！你永远不要用其他名字称呼我！”

_Sachiel's lips parted slightly and she stared with widening Angel eyes as Shinji charged forward screaming.  
萨基尔的嘴唇微微张开，她瞪大了天使般的眼睛，看着真嗣尖叫着冲向前去。_

Evangelion Unit 01 surged forward as the Third Messenger stumbled backwards beneath and onslaught of brutal punches, one massive purple hand reaching out to grab the Angel by the faceplate and slam it into the massive wall behind them.  
福音战士初号机猛地向前冲去，第三使徒在猛烈的重拳攻击下踉跄后退，一只巨大的紫色手掌伸出，抓住使徒的面甲，将其狠狠撞向身后的巨大墙壁。

"It's totally out of control! The target seems to be sustaining heavy damage!"  
“它完全失控了！目标似乎正在遭受重创！”

"How! We can't win unless the target's A.T. Field is shattered!"  
“怎么会！除非目标的 A.T.力场被击碎，否则我们无法取胜！”

Maya shook her head wildly.  
玛雅疯狂地摇着头。

"It's already been neutralized...Impossible! Unit One's A.T. Field is out of control!"  
“它已经被中和了……不可能！初号机的 A.T.力场失控了！”

Misato spun around, staring at Kouzou who stood firm and stoic, not surprised by any of this.  
美里猛地转身，盯着坚定而冷漠的克劳斯，对这一切毫不惊讶。

She arched an eyebrow, turning back around quietly.  
她挑了挑眉，静静地转过身来。

_What are they hiding, I wonder? What do they know that we don't?  
他们在隐瞒什么，我想知道？他们知道些什么是我们不知道的？_

As Misato Katsuragi watched the brutal Evangelion rip apart its opponent, it dawned on her that some questions, especially ones regarding this "Shinji Ikari" were probably better left unanswered...for now.  
当葛城美瑠看着那台残酷的 EVA 将对手撕裂时，她突然意识到，有些问题，尤其是关于这个“碇真嗣”的问题，或许现在还是不要深究为好……至少目前如此。

_Sachiel watched quietly as her body hurtled through the air, blood flying from her delicate lips.  
萨基尔静静地注视着她的身体在空中疾飞，鲜血从她娇嫩的唇边飞溅而出。_

_"So...You are that one then...I suppose...I have failed...Forgive me Shamshel..."  
“那么...你就是那个了...我想...我失败了...请原谅我，沙姆谢尔...”_

Evangelion Unit 01 let out a crashing bestial roar as it slammed a fist into the Angel, tearing off bone and flesh as it send the creature crashing all over the massive walls of the shaft.  
福音战士 01 号发出一声野兽般的咆哮，一拳击中使徒，撕裂了它的骨肉，将其重重地击倒在深井的巨大墙壁上。

NERV 总部，主轴**

Gendo Ikari stood there, watching the Evangelion crash about the walls there, fighting the Messenger. The boy inside was screaming and clenching his fists, he knew that.  
碇源堂站在那里，注视着 Evangelion 在墙壁间撞击，与使者战斗。他知道，里面的男孩正在尖叫，紧握着拳头。

_That boy…your son, Yui… 那个男孩……你的儿子，唯……_

He stared at the Evangelion as it fought, no feelings of pride or even thoughts on the simple fact that this was the product of he and his greatest love.  
他凝视着那台 Evangelion 战斗的场景，心中没有丝毫的自豪感，甚至对这件他和挚爱共同创造的产物也毫无思绪。

He had clenched his eyes tight and flushed out those feelings long ago, they were irrelevant as long as she was gone.  
很久以前，他就紧闭双眼，将那些情感彻底排除，只要她不在了，这些情感便无关紧要。

"_Don't be difficult…I'm leaving you with your uncle…"_  
“别闹别扭了……我要把你留给你的叔叔……”

"_No! Daddy, please don't leave! Where's mommy!"_  
"不！爸爸，请不要离开！妈妈在哪里！"

"_She's dead, Shinji…"_ "她已经去世了，真嗣……"

"_No! You're lying!"_ "不！你在撒谎！"

"_You saw it with your own eyes…you remember…"_  
"你亲眼所见……你记得……"

He felt resolve through remembering his past transgressions. He was…comfortable this way. His pain fueled his work, and his work fueled the hope that she would return. She could not leave him, not in this godforsaken place.  
通过回忆过去的错误，他感受到了决心。他……这样很自在。他的痛苦推动着工作，而工作又燃起了她会回来的希望。她不能离开他，不能在这个该死的地方。

Gendo blinked numbly as the wave of blood splashed upon him, coating his body except for his left arm and head.  
碇源堂麻木地眨了眨眼，血浪扑面而来，除了左臂和头部，全身都被染红了。

He did not even flinch against the liquid, standing with a blank face and turning away from the fight.  
面对那液体，他连眼都没眨一下，面无表情地站在那里，转身远离了战斗。

He touched his damp clothes, bringing up the liquid and smelling it.  
他摸了摸湿漉漉的衣服，举起沾有液体的手嗅了嗅。

It smelled like _her._ 那味道像极了她。

Suddenly, a rush of wind and his clothes were blasted, he had only seconds to look back up before the mass of the Third Messenger of God slammed directly into the metal railing that he was standing on.  
突然间，一阵疾风袭来，他的衣物被猛烈吹起，他只有几秒钟的时间抬头望去，只见第三位神的使者那庞大的身躯直接撞上了他站立的金属栏杆。

_YUI! YUI！_

A group of gray obelisks stood in the darkness, labeled with numbers and different information. Voices could be heard playing off the walls in the cold, damp darkness.  
一群灰色的方尖碑矗立在黑暗中，标有数字和不同的信息。冰冷潮湿的黑暗中，墙壁上回荡着声音。

"The second coming of Angels... It's too abrupt."  
“天使的第二次降临...太过突然了。”

"And Ikari's death…This is not in the scenario…Not at all…"  
“还有一方的死…这不在剧本里…完全不在…”

" It's just like fifteen years ago. Disasters always strike without notice."  
“就像十五年前一样。灾难总是突如其来。”

"This may be fortunate for us from the view that our prior investment has come to nothing."  
"从我们之前的投资一无所获的角度来看，这或许对我们是有利的。"

"His son will be far easier to manipulate…"  
"他的儿子将更容易操控……"

" Things have yet to turn out. If it ends up being useless, then it's a waste."  
"事情尚未有结果。如果最终变得毫无用处，那就是浪费。"

"That's right. As for the anti-Angel measures now commonly known, NERV will control the information about them both quickly and appropriately."  
"没错。至于现在广为人知的反天使措施，NERV 将迅速且恰当地控制相关信息。"

"The Human Complement Project, that is what NERV must give the highest priority."  
"人类补完计划，这是 NERV 必须给予最高优先级的事项。"

"That's right. That project is our only hope in such circumstances."  
"确实如此。在当前情况下，该计划是我们唯一的希望。"

"Anyway, even though Angels have come again, that project must not fall behind schedule. As for Ikari's budgets, they shall be destroyed."  
"无论如何，即便天使再次降临，那个项目也不能延误。至于碇的预算，将被彻底销毁。"

"Indeed, the committee will take over now."  
"确实，委员会现在将接管一切。"

"Humanity has no more time."  
"人类已经没有时间了。"

**NERV Headquarters NERV 总部**

Misato sighed, changing television channels and yawning.  
美里叹了口气，切换着电视频道，打了个哈欠。

She was quite jittery lately, as she had been promoted to Sub-Commander of the entire Tokyo-3 NERV Facility until Gendo recovered, while Kouzou had been promoted to the commanding position, and Makoto had taken her position. This was all temporary however, as long as Gendo was living.  
她最近相当紧张，因为她被提拔为整个东京-3 NERV 设施的副指挥官，直到源堂康复，而高雄则晋升为指挥官职位，真希则接替了她的位置。不过这些都是暂时的，只要源堂还活着。

"The Government announcement this morning regarding yesterday's state of special emergency says..."  
"今早政府关于昨日特别紧急状态的公告称..."

"In this incident..." "在此事件中..."

"The U.N. forces in Japan..."  
"驻日联合国部队..."

Misato yawned, fanning herself and turning to Ritsuko.  
美里打了个哈欠，扇着风转向律子。

"The announcement was "Scenario D-22". The facts were hushed up again.  
“公告是‘D-22 方案’。事实又被掩盖了。”

Ritsuko smiled grimly. 律子苦笑了一下。

"The people in the Public Relations Department seem happy to finally have something to do."  
"公关部的人似乎很高兴终于有事情可做了。"

"They seemed rather optimistic."  
"他们看起来相当乐观。"

"Well... The truth is that everyone is afraid…"  
"嗯... 事实是，每个人都很害怕…"

"Of course..." "当然……"

"By the way, have you heard Misato? Shinji has recovered consciousness…His room was only a few minutes away from the one where the Commander is in critical condition from his injuries. It was reckless of him to enter the Main Shaft."  
"对了，你听说了吗，美里？真嗣已经恢复意识了……他的房间离指挥官因伤势严重而处于危险状态的房间只有几分钟的路程。他进入主轴真是太鲁莽了。"

"How…is the Third Child, Ritsuko?"  
"第三适格者情况如何，律子？"

"No external wounds, but his memory is somewhat confused…I had him transported to my apartment for now…A temporary arrangement."  
"没有外伤，但他的记忆有些混乱……我暂时让人把他送到我的公寓……临时安排。"

"Are you sure that's the right thing to do, Akagi? Is he mentally contaminated?"  
"你确定这样做对吗，赤木？他会不会精神上受到了污染？"

" I was told not to worry about it by Commander Fuyutsuki…"  
" 副司令官冬月告诉我不用担心……"

"I see... " "我明白了... "

It's a wonder that no major damage was caused by Evangelion Unit 01 going berserk. A severe burden was imposed on Shinji's cranial nerves…"  
真没想到初号机暴走竟然没有造成重大损害。这对真嗣的脑神经来说是个沉重的负担……

"I see…" "我明白了…"

Misato sighed, gazing out and watching as NERV transports carried a massive gun away.  
美里叹了口气，凝视着窗外，看着 NERV 的运输车运走了一门巨大的炮。

"If Eva and this city function properly, we'll be able to win."  
“如果 Eva 和这座城市运作正常，我们就能赢。”

"So you'll defeat the Angels? You are as optimistic as always, Sub-Commander…"  
“所以你要击败使徒？你一如既往地乐观，副司令……”

"Wishful thinking is a necessity for human life."  
"幻想是人类生存的必需品。"

Ritsuko smiled grimly. 律子苦笑了一下。

"I guess. Your optimistic character is refreshing, as always…"  
"或许吧。你一如既往的乐观性格真是令人耳目一新…"

"Thanks …Remember to give the Third Child my regards…"  
"谢谢……记得向第三适格者转达我的问候……"

**NERV Headquarters NERV 总部**

Misato stood on the elevator, staring quietly at Ritsuko.  
美里站在电梯里，静静地凝视着律子。

"Are you sure it's right that he stay at your place?"  
"你确定让他住你那儿合适吗？"

Ritsuko looked bemused. 律子看起来有些困惑。

"What, jealous Misato?" "怎么，嫉妒了，美里？"

"Oh, gimme a break Akagi!"  
"哦，饶了我吧，赤木！"

_No…there's something odd about that boy…the rage in his voice…his bloodthirst…I saw that battle…  
不……那个男孩有些古怪……他声音中的愤怒……他的嗜血……我目睹了那场战斗……_

"Is it really natural that Shinji not be with his father?"  
"真嗣不和他父亲在一起，这真的正常吗？"

Ritsuko sighed as the elevator reached the level and stepped off, peering emotionlessly back at Misato.  
律子叹了口气，电梯到达楼层后走了出来，面无表情地回头看了一眼美里。

"If anything, it's more unusual for them to be living together…"  
“如果说有什么不寻常的，那就是他们居然住在一起……”

She turned around, making her way towards the exit.  
她转过身，朝出口走去。

_Gendo…Gendo…Gendo…My lie has become truth, hasn't it? Who is this young man of the cursed Ikari bloodline that you've abandoned? Her son, isn't he?__But not your son, no, not anymore…_  
源堂…源堂…源堂…我的谎言已成为现实，不是吗？这个被诅咒的碇家血脉中的年轻人，你抛弃了他，是谁？她的儿子，对吧？但不再是你的儿子，不，再也不是了…

_His father strolled away quietly, ignoring his screams, tears running down young Shinji's face, bitter burning tears of an abandoned child.  
他的父亲静静地走开，对他的尖叫置若罔闻，年幼的真嗣脸上泪水滑落，是被遗弃的孩子那苦涩灼热的泪水。_

"_No! Where's mamma! Don't leave me! Please! Stop it! No!"_  
“不！妈妈在哪里！不要离开我！求求你！停下来！不！”

"Shinji…" “真嗣…”

Shinji Ikari gasped, opening his eyes wide and writhing in surprise, a calm yet stiff hand stopping him.  
碇真嗣倒抽一口气，猛地睁大眼睛并惊慌地扭动着，一只平静却僵硬的手阻止了他。

His eyes drifted up to notice Ritsuko Akagi, who averted her glance, sighing.  
他的目光向上移，注意到赤木律子，她避开了视线，叹了口气。

Ikari noticed then that he was in an unfamiliar room with an unfamiliar ceiling in an unfamiliar bed.  
真嗣这时才注意到自己身处一个陌生的房间，躺在一张陌生的床上，头顶是陌生的天花板。

_What…happened? 发生了…什么？_

"What happened…Miss Akagi?"  
“发生了…什么事，赤木小姐？”

"Doctor-No, you can call me Ritsuko, Shinji."  
“博士——不，你可以叫我律子，真嗣。”

"Alright…um…Ritsuko…" "好吧……嗯……律子……"

"You don't remember what happened?"  
"你不记得发生了什么吗？"

Ritsuko sighed, delivering news that sent a shiver up Shinji's spine.  
律子叹了口气，她带来的消息让真嗣的脊背一阵发凉。

His father, Gendo Ikari's condition had apparently worsened since Shinji had fought the angel. Such a powerful man helpless to the cords of fate, which were even now spinning new events, or perhaps being cut. Shinji didn't know what to think about his father...Those kind words...The abandonment...He could not forgive his father for that...ever!  
自从真嗣与使徒战斗以来，他的父亲碇源堂的情况显然恶化了。这样一个强大的男人却无法摆脱命运的束缚，那些命运之线如今或许正在编织新的篇章，又或许正在被切断。真嗣不知道该如何看待他的父亲……那些温柔的话语……那次抛弃……他永远无法原谅父亲……永远！

Yet he could not bring himself to despise his father. He almost felt sympathy for the man, since they shared the common feeling of loss. Yui Ikari. For Shinji the loss of a mother he had barely known but still dreamed of. For Gendo the loss of a wife and collaborator, and perhaps Shinji thought, a true love.  
然而，他无法让自己憎恨父亲。他几乎对这个男人产生了同情，因为他们共享着失去的共同感受。碇唯。对于真嗣来说，是失去了几乎不曾了解却依然梦寐以求的母亲。对于源堂来说，是失去了妻子和合作伙伴，也许真嗣认为，还有真正的爱。

He couldn't summon the energy to cry, but he felt an immense emptiness, glancing up at Ritsuko.  
他没有力气哭泣，但感到一种巨大的空虚，抬头望向律子。

"Where…am I?" "我…在哪儿？"

Ritsuko blushed. 律子脸红了。

"Errr, my apartment. Your new living quarters…"  
"呃，我的公寓。你新的住处…"

He looked taken aback. 他看起来有些惊讶。

"Um…You didn't have to do that Miss Ritsuko, it's alright….I prefer being alone…"  
“呃……你不必这么做，Ritsuko 小姐，没关系……我更喜欢一个人……”

"It's alright Shinji, I've already arranged everything…This makes it easier for me to monitor your physical and mental health…"  
“没关系的，真嗣，我已经安排好了……这样更方便我监控你的身心健康……”

For a second Shinji seemed almost disappointed, though it was probably a trick of the light.  
有那么一瞬间，真嗣似乎显得有些失望，尽管这可能只是光线造成的错觉。

"Oh." “哦。”

"Well, feel free to rest, these are your new quarters, I'll have your clothes and bags sent over…We need to wake up early for sync testing tomorrow."  
“好吧，请随意休息，这是你的新房间，我会让人把你的衣服和行李送过来……我们明天需要早起进行同步测试。”

She smiled brightly, though it seemed rather artificial, and left the apartment, Shinji staring quietly at the ceiling.  
她笑得灿烂，尽管显得有些做作，随后离开了公寓，真嗣静静地凝视着天花板。

"I prefer…being alone...every place is the same…"  
“我更喜欢…独自一人…无论哪里都一样…”

**Ritsuko Akagi's Apartment  
赤木律子的公寓**

Ritsuko sighed, settling in her bedroom.  
律子叹了口气，安顿在自己的卧室里。

_Maybe Misato's right…Why did I arrange for him to stay at my place? Did I feel sorry for him? For HIS son? Am…I feeling guilty about what I told him! It's not a lie dammit, it…it's like it came to pass basically…The ends justify the means…  
也许美里说得对……我为什么要安排他住在我这里？是同情他吗？还是他的儿子？我……我是因为对他说的那些话感到内疚吗！那不是谎言，该死，它……它基本上就是那样发生的……结果证明手段是正确的……_

She drew the blankets over her sparsely-clothed form, feeling chilly.  
她拉过毯子盖在衣着单薄的身上，感到一阵寒意。

_No…This…is purely for monitoring purposes. The Third Child must be kept stable and docile…  
不……这只是为了监控目的。第三适格者必须保持稳定和温顺……_

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**Ritsuko Akagi's Apartment  
赤木律子博士的公寓**

Shinji awoke, feeling shy and noticing that it was quite late in the morning, wiping morning tears from his face and glancing around the still unfamiliar room, noticing that his clothes had arrive.  
真嗣醒来，感到羞涩，注意到时间已近中午，他擦去脸上的晨泪，环顾这个依旧陌生的房间，发现自己的衣服已经送到了。

Quickly dressing, he stepped timidly out of the room, looking around.  
他迅速穿上衣服，怯生生地走出房间，四处张望。

Ritsuko's apartment was sparsely decorated but rather roomy, noticing the kitchen a few feet away, the bathroom, living room and two other bedrooms, one of which was probably Ritsuko's. Apparently she was still inside one.  
律子的公寓装饰简单却颇为宽敞，他注意到几英尺外的厨房、浴室、客厅和另外两间卧室，其中一间大概是律子的。显然她还在其中一间里。

Turning to the kitchen, he entered and his hands began to move almost without his urging, breakfast made quickly, the smell of eggs filling the apartment.  
转向厨房，他走了进去，双手几乎不由自主地动了起来，早餐很快做好，鸡蛋的香味弥漫了整个公寓。

He'd always been used to such duties…It was…expected of him.  
他早已习惯这些职责……这是……他所被期望的。

Breakfast cooking, he decided a shower would be nice, to clear his mind of all this confusion and madness.  
在做早餐时，他觉得洗个澡会不错，以清除脑海中所有的困惑和疯狂。

Quietly he strolled into the bathroom, just in time to collide with Ritsuko's naked form.  
他静静地走进浴室，正好撞上了赤裸的律子。

"Ahh!" “啊！”

She gasped and an instant blush went all through his body as he darted out of the bathroom, muttering a quick apology.  
她倒抽一口气，他瞬间满脸通红，急忙从浴室冲出来，嘴里快速咕哝着道歉。

Ritsuko cursed herself, quickly grabbing her clothes.  
律子暗自咒骂，迅速抓起自己的衣服。

_I'm not used to having to close the door…or live with someone else…but…change is alright I suppose.  
我不习惯关门……或是和别人一起生活……但……改变也还不错吧。_

Fully clothing herself, she stepped out, Shinji timidly at the dinner table with breakfast cooked as well.  
她穿好衣服，走了出去，看到真嗣怯生生地坐在餐桌旁，早餐也已经准备好了。

_This…is new as well… 这……也是新的体验……_

"You…didn't have to Shinji…"  
"你……不必这样的，真嗣……"

Shinji nodded, not making eye contact.  
真嗣点点头，没有直视对方。

"I'm just…used to it…I always did that back home with my tutor…"  
"我只是……习惯了……在家时我总是这样和我的家庭教师一起做……"

"Well…welcome home, Shinji Ikari…"  
"嗯……欢迎回家，碇真嗣……"

They stared at each other for what seemed like ages, then, the phone rang.  
他们彼此凝视着，仿佛过了许久，然后电话铃声响起。

Ritsuko quickly picked it up, answering.  
律子迅速接起电话，应答道。

"Yes? Dr. Ritsuko Akagi…He's? Yes…Yes…right here…Alright…Okay…Immediately."  
"什么事？赤木律子博士……他？是的……是的……就在这里……好的……明白了……马上。"

She put down the phone and looked grimly at Shinji Ikari.  
她放下电话，严肃地看着碇真嗣。

"Shinji…your father has passed…We need to leave…Now."  
"真嗣……你父亲已经……我们得走了……现在。"

The Third Child strolled towards the door, words echoing in his mind as he moved, they seemed to just flow out of him.  
第三子悠闲地走向门口，话语在他脑海中回响，仿佛自然而然地从他口中流出。

_I feel nothing… 我什么感觉都没有……_

Shinji paused by the front door as Ritsuko put on her shoes, staring out into the city around him, the uniform, almost identical buildings.  
真嗣在玄关前停下脚步，看着律子穿上鞋子，凝视着周围的城市，那些几乎一模一样的统一建筑。

_I am…nothing 我……什么都不是_

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, NERV Infirmary  
NERV 总部，NERV 医务室**

Shinji Ikari stared at Ritsuko as she led him into the small dark adjoining room of the NERV Infirmary room they had entered. She had protested at his request at first, but noting his odd condition, finally gave in. He would be able to see his father.  
碇真嗣盯着赤木律子，她带他走进了 NERV 医务室旁边的小暗室。她一开始反对他的请求，但注意到他奇怪的状态后，最终还是妥协了。他终于能见到他的父亲了。

Shinji stood silently beside the large table where Gendo Ikari was lain out, a blanket luckily covering his naked body from his neck down. Oddly enough, he was still wearing his glasses, even in death; no one had cared to remove them.  
真嗣静静地站在那张大桌子旁，上面躺着碇源堂，幸运的是，一条毯子从他的脖子一直盖到了身体。奇怪的是，他即使在死后仍戴着眼镜；没有人关心过要摘下它们。

"So Shinji, there you are, I don't know why you had such a morbid request anyway."  
“真嗣，你来了，我真不知道你为什么会有这么病态的要求。”

A few minutes passed of Shinji staring at Gendo's face, looking at the menacing stare that still remained there even in death. No one had cared to shut Gendo's eyelids either, it looked like he had died with a look of utter sadness and resignation on his face, an odd emotion he never seemed to show that now made his face look odd and alien, almost like a circus clown, Shinji noted without amusement.  
真嗣盯着碇源堂的脸看了几分钟，那副即使在死后依然存在的凶狠目光。也没有人关心过要合上碇源堂的眼睑，他的脸上似乎带着一种极度的悲伤和屈服，这种他从未表现过的情感现在让他的脸显得奇怪而陌生，几乎像个小丑，真嗣毫无幽默感地注意到。

"Shinji? Are you okay? Maybe this wasn't a good idea…"  
"真嗣？你还好吗？也许这并不是个好主意……"

Shinji nodded and Ritsuko slowly left the room.  
真嗣点点头，律子慢慢地离开了房间。

The Third Child stopped though, and returned quickly, his hands reaching out and carefully removing Gendo's glasses and after staring at the initials "G.I" on the sides, putting them slowly on his face, cautiously as if they were dangerous or cursed.  
第三适格者停了下来，又迅速返回，双手伸出，小心翼翼地摘下源堂的眼镜，盯着镜腿上的"G.I"字母看了片刻，然后慢慢地戴在自己脸上，谨慎得仿佛它们带有危险或诅咒。

Shinji paused and stared through the tinted glasses. He saw nothing different through these glasses, he saw no change, yet he felt a certain sympathy for his father. Yet another Ikari yearning for Yui, yet another outcast, shunned by friends, damned to go on a path of terror. His father had wanted to see him before he had died…perhaps…  
真嗣停下脚步，透过有色眼镜凝视着。透过这些眼镜，他看到的并无不同，没有变化，然而他却对父亲产生了一种莫名的同情。又一个渴望优的碇家之人，又一个被朋友排斥的局外人，注定要走上恐怖之路。他的父亲在去世前曾想见他一面……或许……

Shinji Ikari suddenly felt quite comfortable with the glasses on his face.  
碇真嗣突然觉得戴上眼镜后感觉相当舒适。

A familiar voice streamed through the room's intercom.  
一个熟悉的声音通过房间的扬声器传来。

"Shinji Ikari, the Commander Fuyutsuki is ready to see you now."  
“碇真嗣，副司令冬月已经准备好见你了。”

Ritsuko turned around at the sound of the intercom, quickly motioning for Shinji to hurry up with her hand. The motions stopped in mid-beckon however, as Ritsuko Akagi beheld Gendo incarnate. The young Ikari had on a simple NERV uniform, dark and black and almost identical to the one his father wore regularly, and there were signs of the telltale Ikari facial features growing, the rigid but somewhat handsome face. And now these glasses.  
听到对讲机的声音，律子转过身来，迅速用手势示意真嗣快点。然而，当她看到眼前的碇源堂化身时，手势停在了半空中。年轻的真嗣穿着一件简单的 NERV 制服，深黑色，几乎与他父亲经常穿的那件一模一样，而且已经开始显现出碇家特有的面部特征，那张坚毅但颇为英俊的脸。还有现在这副眼镜。

Ritsuko blushed deeply and then shook her head, glancing at Shinji.  
律子脸颊泛红，然后摇了摇头，瞥了真嗣一眼。

"Shinji, take those off right now, you look ridiculous!"  
“真嗣，马上把那些脱掉，你看起来太滑稽了！”

**Tokyo 3, Japan 日本，第三新东京市**

**NERV Headquarters, Commander's Office  
NERV 总部，指挥官办公室**

Shinji stood in front of the dark, expansive closed doors of the Commander's office. He had not been here many times, and the few times he had been were full of bad memories. Memories he no longer cared for.  
真嗣站在指挥官办公室那扇漆黑、宽大的紧闭门前。他来这里的次数不多，而每次来访都充满了糟糕的回忆。那些回忆，他已不再在意。

A voice from inside of the office shook Shinji from his mental revelry. It was Commander Fuyutsuki.  
办公室内传来的声音将真嗣从沉思中唤醒。那是副司令冬月。

"You may come in Shinji."  
“你可以进来了，真嗣。”

Shinji slowly entered the dark office, almost instantly realizing it had been changed slightly. It was still dark and threatening, but there were a few more lights in the room, as long as many more Section 2 guards. Also, the personage of Fuyutsuki behind the desk was not threatening at all, perhaps authorative and wise, but certainly not menacing. In fact he seemed to be currently giving Shinji a very sympathetic and kind old man's look as the Third Child approached.  
真嗣缓缓走进昏暗的办公室，几乎立刻意识到这里稍有变化。房间依旧昏暗且充满压迫感，但多了几盏灯，以及更多的第二支部警卫。此外，坐在桌后的冬月不再显得威胁，或许依然权威而睿智，但绝非凶狠。事实上，当他走近时，这位第三适格者看到的是一个充满同情与慈祥的老人目光。

"Shinji. I am glad to see you. I never did get to meet you on your arrival...I feel your pain, and I was a dear friend of your mother's"  
"真嗣，很高兴见到你。你来的时候我没能见到你……我能感受到你的痛苦，而且我和你母亲是非常亲密的朋友。"

Shinji shied away but did not succumb. Some parts of Fuyutsuki's talk seemed genial and truthful but he could sense some artificiality in some of the comments.  
真嗣有些退缩，但没有屈服。冬月的一些话听起来亲切而真诚，但他能感觉到其中有些话有些做作。

"Alright, Commander." "好的，司令官。"

"No need to call me that Shinji, just call me Mr. Fuyutsuki, in fact Commander may no longer apply to me anyway…"  
"不必那样叫我真嗣，直接叫我福音月先生就好，实际上‘指挥官’这个称呼可能也不再适用于我了……"

"Huh, what do you mean, Comm-"  
"啊？你什么意思，指——"

"Mr. Fuyutsuki" "福音月先生"

"Yeah…Mr. Fuyutsuki…" "是啊……冬月先生……"

"Well, you will see my meaning soon enough, Shinji. And that brings me to the current matter; there are your father's papers, his personal things, and his will and testament."  
"嗯，你很快就会明白我的意思，真嗣。接下来我要说的是当前的事；这里有你父亲的文件，他的私人物品，还有他的遗嘱和遗言。"

"His personal things? And his will?"  
"他的私人物品？还有遗嘱？"

"Yes, I will leave you be in this room, they are all lain strewn on my desk, his papers, even dating back to before he met your mom. As well as his will and testament, this is worth reading as well."  
"是的，我会让你在这房间里安静，他的文件都散落在我的桌上，甚至追溯到他遇见你母亲之前。还有他的遗嘱和遗言，这些也值得一读。"

Shinji nodded sadly and walked towards the Commander's desk as Fuyutsuki and the agents walked past him.  
真嗣悲伤地点点头，走向指挥官的桌子，而冬月和特工们从他身边走过。

"Goodbye Shinji, this will be very interesting for you."  
"再见，真嗣，这对你来说将会非常有趣。"

Shinji did not reply as the door closed and sent the room into darkness except for the dim lights.  
门关上后，房间陷入一片黑暗，只有微弱的灯光闪烁。

He looked at the foremost document.  
他看向最前面的文件。

_I, Gendo Ikari, being 49 years of age and of sound mind and body, do hereby request the following upon my death:  
我，碇源堂，现年 49 岁，身心健全，特此在死后提出以下请求：_

_1) That no public or private funeral or memorial services be held in my honor;  
1) 不得为我举行任何公开或私人的葬礼或纪念仪式；_

_2) That the NERV Medical Ward takes charge of my body after death and arrange for, and supervise the cremation of my remains.  
2) 由 NERV 医疗部门在我去世后负责处理我的遗体，并安排及监督遗体的火化事宜。_

_3) That my remains are to be immediately cremated or cremated as soon as practical after my death.  
3) 我的遗体应立即或在实际可行的情况下尽快进行火化。_

_4) That my cremated remains be scattered in the over the memorial marker marking Yui Ikari in the Tokyo 3 Memorial Cemetery.  
4) 我的骨灰应撒在东京第三纪念公墓中标记为绫波唯的纪念碑上方。_

_5.) That once he has reached the age of 15, Shinji Ikari be designated the new commander of the NERV organization. This has been previously approved by the correct organizations. And that all my earthly belongings are designated under Shinji Ikari.  
5.) 一旦他年满 15 岁，碇真嗣将被指定为 NERV 组织的新指挥官。此决定已得到相关组织的预先批准。并且我所有尘世财产均指定归碇真嗣所有。_

Shinji's eyes widened perceptively and the veins in his foreheads bulged at the last item.  
真嗣的眼睛明显睁大，额头上的青筋因最后一项而凸起。

"What? Fifteen? In a year!"  
"什么？一年十五次！"

His eyes fell on an envelope attached to the will, and he quickly opened it, staring at the document inside.  
他的目光落在遗嘱附带的一个信封上，他迅速打开它，盯着里面的文件。

_Shinji, my son. You may find my actions questionable, but that is inevitable. We have never understood each other; no one can fully understand another, that is the tragedy of man. Yet I realize now my foolishness. We both have a personal longing, you for a mother, I for a wife, both the same person, Yui Ikari.  
真嗣，我的儿子。你可能会质疑我的行为，但这是不可避免的。我们从未真正理解对方；没有人能完全理解另一个人，这是人类的悲剧。然而我现在意识到我的愚蠢。我们都有个人的渴望，你渴望一个母亲，我渴望一个妻子，两者是同一个人，碇唯。_

He tried to shut the will and the note out of his mind, that was impossible, but…perhaps…  
他试图将遗嘱和那张纸条从脑海中抹去，这不可能，但……或许……

He stared at the next document, a dirty piece of paper that he could barely read.  
他盯着下一份文件，一张脏兮兮的纸，几乎难以辨认。

_My glance fell on a girl my age trotting past me, but it was too discreet for anyone to notice. Yui Ikari, beautiful by all standards and smart as well, she was no model of course, but she had fair hair and a nice face that hinted at a patrician upbringing. Indeed she was simply the latest in a long stream of girls of similar nature and appearance that I have secretly admired, all through high school even. I felt my gaze wandering to her long legs, to her kind face, to her blue eyes, and wondered why I was so mesmerized by them. I could come up with simply hundreds of thousands of adjectives to describe them, but no words to explain why I felt this way. They were simple body parts, nothing more, why did I find them so sublimely beautiful? How did I even bring up my definition of beautiful? Perhaps this was what I've been programmed over the years to be mesmerized, by the media, by the people around me. But I supposed that that is how one defines oneself, by the entities and objects around themselves. She is certainly quite mesmerizing.  
我的目光落在一个与我同龄的女孩身上，她轻盈地从我身边跑过，那动作太过隐秘，无人察觉。Yui Ikari，无论从哪个标准看都美丽动人且聪慧过人，当然她并非模特，却有着一头柔顺的金发和一张透露出贵族气质的姣好面容。实际上，她不过是我在高中期间暗自仰慕的众多气质与外貌相似的女孩中的最新一位。我感到自己的视线不由自主地飘向她修长的双腿，她温柔的面庞，她湛蓝的双眸，疑惑自己为何如此着迷。我可以想出成千上万的形容词来描述她们，却找不到任何词汇来解释我这种感觉的缘由。它们不过是普通的身体部位，仅此而已，为何我觉得它们美得如此超凡脱俗？我是如何定义美的？或许多年来，我已被媒体和周围的人所影响，潜移默化地对这些产生了迷恋。但我想，一个人正是通过身边的实体和对象来定义自己的。她的确相当迷人。_

Shinji stifled back a choking moan, the documents were touching him in a place where he felt quite uncomfortable, he felt uneasy as the few memories of his mother surfaced past his iron mental walls.  
真嗣强忍住哽咽的呻吟，这些文件触及了他内心深处感到极不舒服的地方，每当母亲零星的记忆突破他坚不可摧的心理防线时，他都会感到不安。

It has been so peaceful to lie there in her arms as she swayed him back and forth, cooing sweet words, it had been the only truly happy moment of his life.  
躺在她的怀里，随着她轻轻摇晃，耳边是她温柔的低语，那段时光是如此宁静祥和，也是他生命中唯一真正快乐的时刻。

Shinji slammed his fist onto the desk and then stared blankly off into space.  
真嗣一拳砸在桌上，随后茫然地凝视着虚空。

Shinji smiled sadly and without much emotion as he went back into his reading.  
真嗣苦笑着，带着几分淡漠，继续埋头阅读。

_I'm not used to being liked. Being hated, on the other hand, is quite familiar.  
我不习惯被人喜欢。相比之下，被憎恨倒是再熟悉不过了。_

**Unknown Location  未知地点**

**SEELE Committee SEELE 委员会**

The dark room that constituted the meeting place for the SEELE Committee was silent. Few knew of the location of this place, other than a few choice officials and servants to SEELE itself. They were practically invincible. Few knew of their true names, or even what they currently looked like or where they lived.  
构成 SEELE 委员会会议地点的昏暗房间内一片寂静。除了少数精选的官员和 SEELE 本身的仆从外，鲜有人知晓此地的位置。他们几乎是无敌的。鲜有人知道他们的真实姓名，甚至他们现在的样貌或居住地。

Assassination attempts had occurred, but those were few in number and doomed from the start. They had nothing to fear, except perhaps the trust they had put in a few men outside the committee, such as the commander of NERV.  
虽然发生过暗杀企图，但数量寥寥且注定失败。他们无所畏惧，或许除了对委员会外少数几人的信任，比如 NERV 的指挥官。

They had received news of Gendo's death and of his son's arrival, but to them it was irrelevant. And Ikari was always an Ikari, a treacherous snake who was always planning ulterior motives. The only difference, they hoped, was that Shinji and Fuyutsuki's will would be far more malleable.  
他们已得知碇的死讯及其子的到来，但这对他们无关紧要。碇始终是碇，一条总是策划着阴谋诡计的狡猾之蛇。他们唯一希望的是，真嗣和冬月的意志将远比以往更加可塑。

Keele grumbled, bringing silence to the rest of the Committee.  
基尔抱怨道，让委员会的其他成员陷入了沉默。

"Ikari tried to turn his son into a God, we see this now, more than ever."  
“碇试图将他的儿子变成神，我们现在比以往任何时候都更清楚这一点。”

"Perhaps. But if that is so, who shall be the conductor of the final phase?"  
“或许吧。但如果真是这样，谁将担任最后阶段的指挥者呢？”

"It is no matter what this Ikari is doing. Fate is ever present. The final plan will occur, whether Ikari likes it or not.  
"碇这个人的所作所为无关紧要。命运始终存在。最终计划必将发生，无论碇是否愿意。"

"He is inexperienced." "他缺乏经验。"

"His will is weak." "他的意志薄弱。"

"It shall break." “它将会破碎。”

Well, hope that wasn't a horrible chapter or anything…Boring? Lame?  
嗯，希望那不是个糟糕的chapter或者别的什么……无聊？蹩脚？

It's progressing along… 事情正在进展中……

And yeah, you might be saying, "What! This is more Ritsuko/Shinji or Shinji/Nothing than Rei/Shinji!"  
是啊，你可能会说，“什么！这更多的是律子/真嗣或真嗣/无，而不是绫波/真嗣！”

But to that I say, "Are you retarded?"  
但对此我要说，“你是脑子有问题吗？”

What do you want, Rei to show up and start passionately making out with Shinji or something? Have patience…  
你想要什么，绫波突然出现开始和真嗣激情拥吻之类的？耐心点……
