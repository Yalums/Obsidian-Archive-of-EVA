Once again, Shinji shows Asuka up. She has mixed feelings about it.  
又一次，真嗣让明日香相形见绌。对此，她心情复杂。

---
Asuka rolled onto her side with an exasperated huff and kicked the blanket that had been covering her off of the bed. Her simmering frustration was doing the job of keeping her warm despite her low-cut top and extremely short shorts. As was common for her birthdays, when she bothered to observe the date, she was alone. It was just like the Invincible Shinji to abandon her like this, swooping in out of nowhere to steal her moment, strike the killing blow, then run off to who-knows-where. Memories of their previous shared battles against the Angels played for Asuka, like a one-woman audience for the amateur home videos their guardian used to try to make when the three of them had been new roommates. Merely with deadly combat against monstrous foes interspliced with the sounds of frantic battle instead of petty domestic quarrels amid blustering juveniles overlaid with crass commentary from a tipsy warden.  
明日香带着恼怒的叹息翻身侧躺，一脚将盖在身上的毯子踢下了床。尽管穿着低胸上衣和极短的短裤，她那沸腾的怒火却足以让她感到温暖。如同她惯常对待生日那样，当她费心去留意这个日子时，她总是独自一人。真像是无敌的 Shinji 会做的事，突然出现抢走她的时刻，给予致命一击，然后又消失得无影无踪。与天使们之前的共同战斗记忆在明日香脑海中回放，仿佛她是一个人观看那些业余的家庭录像，那是他们作为新室友时监护人曾试图拍摄的。只不过这些记忆中，致命的战斗与紧张的战场声响交织，而非幼稚的争吵和醉酒看守的粗俗评论。

This time, however, easily trumped any other instance in her memory. _These are pretty different circumstances,_ Asuka easily conceded to herself as she flopped onto her back and kicked her legs against the mattress impatiently. _But he's still a jerk._ She raised her left arm up, turning the palm of her hand to face the ceiling so she could inspect the ring on her finger. It was too dark in the room to make out any specifics, but she had already committed the fine details to her impeccable memory.  
然而这一次，轻易地超越了她记忆中的任何一次。这些情况确实大不相同，明日香在床上翻了个身，不耐烦地踢着床垫，心里轻易地承认了这一点。但他还是个混蛋。她举起左手，将手掌朝向天花板，以便检查手指上的戒指。房间里太暗了，看不清具体细节，但她已经将这些精细之处铭记于心。

A modestly sized, but still brilliant sapphire set into a thin white gold band, with several smaller crimson rubies nestled around the main stone. Asuka smiled softly at the memory of her then-boyfriend, now fiancé, blushing through his explanation of how he had had the ring specially crafted. He of course had felt the need to almost ruin the moment by trying to apologize for the humble nature of the token, but Asuka supposed he would not be the Idiot Shinji she had fallen in love with if he did not attempt to slip an "I'm sorry" into his proposal.  
一枚适中大小却依旧璀璨的蓝宝石镶嵌在细白金戒圈上，周围环绕着几颗较小的深红色红宝石。明日香温柔地回忆起当时还是男友、如今已是未婚夫的他，在解释如何特意定制这枚戒指时脸红的样子。当然，他觉得有必要几乎破坏那一刻，试图为这份礼物的朴素道歉，但明日香想，如果不是那个她爱上的笨蛋真嗣，他也不会在求婚时试图加上一句“对不起”。

She, naturally, had other, more pleasing ways to keep his lips occupied that easily silenced his contrition. _Besides, I bet this cost a fortune anyway. Just like him to splurge on something for me but never even think about treating himself._ Shinji had stubbornly refused her every effort to get him to spend a little extra on nicer clothes or favored treats for his own benefit, citing the need to be frugal—and more than a little bit of a hesitancy to splurge, given the thrifty nature of his upbringing. He had taken charge of both of their finances after one too many times of Asuka perhaps, just a little, only a smidge, really, overspending on what even she could admit were wasteful purchases. It had been an example of what had become one of his more frequent bouts of decisiveness over the years, though one with a mixed welcome on her part.  
她自然有其他更讨喜的方式让他的唇忙碌，轻松平息他的悔意。再者，我敢打赌这东西本身就价值不菲。他就是这样，总为我挥霍，却从不考虑犒赏自己。真嗣固执地拒绝了她的每一次尝试，不愿在更好的衣物或自己偏爱的零食上多花一分钱，理由是要节俭——再加上他成长于节俭环境，多少有些舍不得花钱。自从多次发现明日香或许只是稍稍、真的只是略微，在她自己也承认的浪费性购物上超支后，他便接管了两人的财务。这是多年来他愈发频繁展现决断力的一个例子，尽管在她看来这番举动喜忧参半。

While Asuka was loathe to admit it to anyone but him, his spending habits and apparently hidden talent for investing—she refused to believe his explanation that he relied on Pen Pen's advice—left the pair rather well off despite their relatively meager NERV salaries stacked against his expensive post-graduate schooling. The world had done much to recover in the years since Third Impact had, well, impacted everyone's lives, but times were still rough; luxuries like the one she was now proudly admiring on her ring finger were not something most could afford.  
尽管明日香不愿向任何人承认，除了他之外，他的消费习惯和看似隐藏的投资才能——她拒绝相信他依赖 Pen Pen 建议的解释——使得两人尽管面对着 NERV 相对微薄的薪水和昂贵的研究生教育支出，却依然生活得相当宽裕。自第三次冲击以来，世界已经历了许多恢复，但时代依然艰难；像她现在自豪地戴在无名指上的奢侈品，大多数人还是难以负担的。

Her examination was cut short at the sound of their apartment's door opening and a muffled cry of "I'm home!" She quickly turned back onto her side, facing away from the bedroom door, and schooled her face into a pout. The rustling of someone hastily setting things up in their kitchen was soon followed by footsteps, then a soft knock.  
她的审视被公寓门打开的声音和一声闷闷的“我回来了！”打断。她迅速转回身，背对着卧室门，脸上摆出一副不悦的表情。紧接着是厨房里匆忙摆放东西的沙沙声，随后是脚步声，然后是一记轻柔的敲门声。

"Asuka? You awake?" Shinji softly inquired.  
“明日香？你醒着吗？”真嗣轻声问道。

"Go away," Asuka told him coldly, her façade as strong as it ever was.  
"走开，" 明日香冷冷地对他说，她的伪装一如既往地坚强。

"But I love you. And I missed you," Shinji implored her.  
"但我爱你。而且我错过了你，" 真嗣恳求她。

Asuka scoffed, making sure it was loud enough for him to hear through the door. "I love you too. But I'm mad at you, you know," she haughtily informed him.  
明日香嗤之以鼻，确保声音大到足以让他隔着门听到。"我也爱你。但我在生你的气，你知道的，" 她傲慢地告诉他。

"Familiar circumstances," she heard him mutter cheekily, but her angry retort was averted by the door opening. She spun to face her intruder, carefully constructed pout swiftly replaced with carefully constructed outrage.  
"熟悉的情景，"她听到他俏皮地嘀咕，但她的愤怒反驳被开门的声响打断了。她转身面对闯入者，精心构建的撅嘴迅速被精心构建的愤怒所取代。

"Pervert! How dare you?! A maiden's bedroom door is—"  
"变态！你怎么敢？！一个少女的卧室门是——"

"Like the impenetrable Walls of Jericho?" Shinji finished for her, smug smile on his face. "You're the one who told me what happened to them, remember?" He leaned against the doorway and admired his fiancée. "Besides," he added boldly, with only a faint blush betraying him, "you're hardly a maiden."  
"像不可逾越的耶利哥城墙？"真嗣替她补完，脸上挂着得意的微笑。"是你告诉我它们发生了什么，记得吗？"他靠在门框上，欣赏着他的未婚妻。"再说了，"他大胆地补充道，只有一丝淡淡的红晕出卖了他，"你可算不上什么少女。"

Asuka giggled in response, all semblance of indignation lost, then patted the open space on the bed next to her. "Come here, Idiot. I missed you too."  
明日香咯咯笑了起来，所有的愤慨都烟消云散，然后拍了拍她身边床上的空位。“过来，笨蛋。我也想你了。”

The young man approached the bed, his stride long and steps light, and laid down. His redheaded companion eagerly repositioned herself against his side, then nestled her head atop his chest and grabbed the arm he encircled her with. With a deep sigh, she used her free hand to draw lazy circles over his abdomen.  
年轻人走向床边，步伐大而轻盈，躺了下来。他的红发同伴急切地调整自己的位置，靠在他身侧，然后将头枕在他的胸膛上，抓住了他环绕她的手臂。她深深叹了口气，用空着的手在他腹部上画着懒散的圆圈。

"I really am mad at you." Her tone was light, matching the pressure of her geometric doodling.  
“我真的很生你的气。”她的语气轻松，与她画的几何图案的力度相匹配。

"Hmm," Shinji grunted. His reply was muffled through his nose which he had buried in her hair, and Asuka shivered at the sensation of the warm air blowing over her scalp.  
“嗯，”真嗣咕哝着。他的回答透过埋在她发间的鼻子显得有些含糊，而明日香则因头顶上温暖的气息拂过而微微颤抖。

"I had it all planned out months ago. I was sick of waiting for you to propose, so naturally I needed to take charge myself."  
“几个月前我就全盘计划好了。我厌倦了等你求婚，所以自然得自己主动出击。”

"Naturally." Shinji brought up his arm not currently encaptured to run his fingers through her hair, carefully loosening the snarls and knots she had gained from tossing and turning while she had professed to be napping.  
“自然。”真嗣抬起那只未被束缚的手，用手指轻轻梳理她的头发，小心翼翼地解开她因声称小憩却辗转反侧而打上的结。

Asuka allowed herself to melt into the feeling of being cared for. "I had a date picked out. The anniversary." She stopped sketching and raised her hand to caress Shinji's face, who leaned into her touch. Her voice took on a more serious note. "I know it's kind of a somber affair, but—I've always thought of it as how we finally came together."  
绫波允许自己沉浸在被关怀的感觉中。“我选定了一个日子。纪念日。”她停下素描，抬起手轻抚真嗣的脸颊，他则倾身贴近她的触碰。她的语气变得严肃起来。“我知道这有点沉重，但是——我一直把它看作是我们最终走到一起的象征。”

"All that awful mess, but it led to the best thing that ever happened to me. To us," Shinji agreed after a deep breath.  
“那场糟糕透顶的混乱，却引领了我一生中最美好的事。对我们来说，”真嗣深吸一口气后赞同道。

"'Awful mess' is putting it lightly. But you're absolutely right, Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me." Asuka kept her hand on Shinji's face and gently rubbed a tear away with her thumb. She pressed tighter into him, and Shinji could feel her smile against his chest. "I invited everybody to a little get-together, even your stooge friends. Swore them all to secrecy. Though I don't think I could have stopped Hikari from bringing her boy-toy even if I wanted to. She volunteered to make food for everyone, and I've never seen Toji miss a free meal. Much less one of Hikari's."  
“‘糟糕透顶’说得还算轻了。但你完全正确，我一生中最美好的事。”绫波仍将手放在真嗣的脸上，用拇指轻轻拭去他的泪水。她更紧地依偎着他，真嗣能感受到她贴在他胸前的微笑。“我邀请了所有人来个小聚会，包括你的那些跟班朋友。我让他们都保密。不过我想就算我想阻止，也没法拦住光子带她的男友来。她主动提出为大家准备食物，而我从未见过阿薰错过一顿免费的饭，更别说是光子做的了。”

"I actually knew about all of it," Shinji confessed. Asuka quickly withdrew her hand from his face to seize a fistful of his shirt, craning her neck to glare directly into his eyes.  
"其实我全都知道，" 真嗣坦白道。明日香迅速从他脸上抽回手，一把抓住他的衬衫，伸长脖子直视他的眼睛。

"Who squealed?" The temperature of the room seemed to drop several degrees for Shinji.  
"谁告的密？" 房间里的温度似乎对真嗣来说下降了几度。

"Rei. But it's not her fault!" He insisted, eyes pleading. Asuka scoffed and rolled her eyes.  
"是丽。但这不是她的错！" 他坚持道，眼神恳求。明日香嗤之以鼻，翻了个白眼。

"Some best friend. I should've known; you're both lousy at keeping secrets." She released her hold on his shirt and smoothed out the material over his chest but settled her head to maintain eye contact.  
"真是个好朋友。我早该料到；你们俩都藏不住秘密。" 她松开了抓着他衬衫的手，抚平了他胸前的布料，但仍将头靠过去保持眼神交流。

"She's been pestering me for the last two years, always asking when we were getting married. Frankly I'd always thought you had put her up to it—"  
"这两年来她一直缠着我，总是问我们什么时候结婚。说实话，我一直以为是你唆使她的——"

"I should have." "我本该这么做的。"

"—so when she suddenly stopped three months ago I got suspicious. I made a dumb joke, something like 'I'll never propose if you forget to remind me'—"  
"—所以当她三个月前突然停止时，我就起了疑心。我开了个愚蠢的玩笑，大概是说‘如果你忘了提醒我，我永远不会求婚’—"

"That _is_ dumb." "那确实很蠢。"

"—and, well," Shinji shrugged his unencumbered shoulder.  
"—然后，嗯，" 真嗣耸了耸没有负担的肩膀。"

"I understand." No more needed to be said about his family's desire to be honest with each other. Asuka placed a chaste kiss on Shinji's cheek, smiling at the way even a small gesture like that could still elicit a blush from the love of her life. She angled herself to whisper directly into his ear, ensuring her voice would have just the right seductive purr she knew would draw out even more of a reaction. "So, you knew all about what I had in mind."  
"我明白了。" 关于家人之间希望坦诚相待的愿望，无需多言。明日香在真嗣的脸颊上轻轻一吻，微笑着看这个小动作仍能让他脸红。她调整姿势，直接对着他的耳朵低语，确保她的声音带着恰到好处的诱惑低沉，她知道这会引发更多的反应。"所以，你早就知道我心里在想什么了。"

"Yeah." Shinji's voice was a guttural mumble, and Asuka could feel the hand she had been comfortably cradling over her stomach work its way under her shirt. She smirked.  
"嗯。" 真嗣的声音含糊不清，明日香感觉到她一直舒适地环抱在她腹部的手正慢慢伸进她的衬衫里。她得意地笑了。

"You knew I was going to propose to you. In less than a month. In front of all our friends and family." She finished her statement by lowering her mouth to his neck, kissing and nipping at the tender flesh. Ever one to get caught up in her own games, Asuka could feel her heart racing, and her breath was coming in short gasps as Shinji's hand continued to wander.  
"你知道我打算向你求婚。不到一个月后。在我们所有的朋友和家人面前。" 她结束这句话时，将嘴唇移到他的脖颈，亲吻并轻咬着那柔嫩的皮肤。明日香总是容易沉浸在自己的游戏中，她能感觉到心跳加速，呼吸急促，而真嗣的手仍在继续游走。

"Mmph." Shinji's other hand, the one that had been combing through her hair, was now firmly holding her close to her ministrations against his neck, though at the moment she was not worried about her voice not having the desired effect with it no longer coming in so close to his vulnerable ear.  
"嗯。" 真嗣的另一只手，原本在梳理她头发的那只，现在正紧紧地抱着她，让她贴近他脖子的抚慰，尽管此刻她并不担心自己的声音不再那么贴近他脆弱的耳朵，效果会大打折扣。

"And yet—mmm—and yet you went and _upstaged me anyway_?" With her last three words, she dropped the sensual tone in favor of one of harsh interrogation, pulling away from Shinji; though only just enough so she could bring her face directly in front of his, nose to nose. She could feel the heat radiating from his flushed skin, as he could feel from her, and she struggled to retain her wrath while his lidded eyes locked with her own and his hands sustained their roaming.  
"然而——嗯——然而你还是抢了我的风头？" 说到最后三个字时，她放弃了性感语调，转而采用严厉审问的口吻，从真嗣身边拉开一点距离；但仅仅够她把脸直接凑到他面前，鼻子贴鼻子。她能感受到他涨红的皮肤散发的热量，正如他能感受到她的，她努力保持愤怒，而他的半闭眼睛与她对视，双手继续游走。

"I'd just commissioned the ring right before I found out. I couldn't get the money back," he said with a small smile, then pulled her in for a deep kiss. Asuka at first chuckled into the kiss, but quickly allowed herself to be subsumed by it. Neither knew, nor cared, how long they kept it up, only that eventually they parted, each softly panting. "I knew you'd prefer it this way," Shinji eventually added as the two held each other on the bed, limbs intertwined. "Plus, we're always busy on your birthday. I wanted to do something special for once."  
"就在我发现之前，我刚订做了那枚戒指。钱已经退不回来了，"他带着一丝微笑说道，然后将她拉进一个深吻。明日香一开始还在吻中轻笑，但很快便沉醉其中。两人都不知也不在乎这个吻持续了多久，只知道最终他们分开时，都轻轻地喘息着。"我知道你会更喜欢这种方式，"真嗣最终补充道，两人在床上相拥，四肢交缠。"而且，你的生日我们总是很忙。我想这次做点特别的。"

"I don't care about my birthday, Idiot," Asuka mumbled into Shinji's neck as she hid her blush from view. "But I'm glad you proposed to me, not the other way around. That's the proper way these things are done."  
"我才不在乎什么生日呢，笨蛋，"明日香埋在真嗣的脖颈间咕哝着，试图隐藏自己的脸红。"但很高兴是你向我求婚，而不是反过来。这才是这些事情该有的样子。"

Shinji remained silent, preferring to enjoy the tranquil feeling of laying next to the woman he loved. Until she remembered she had another reason to be mad at him.  
真嗣保持沉默，更愿意享受躺在心爱女人身边的宁静感觉。直到她想起自己还有另一个生他气的原因。

"And _why_ exactly did you need to take off in the middle of the afternoon, on my birthday, the day you proposed to me, just to go to the store?" She had a playful edge to her voice, but it was an edge Shinji recognized as still being able to cut if he should falter. "You should have gone yesterday to pick up whatever was so important."  
"为什么偏偏要在下午，在我生日，你向我求婚的那天，非得跑去商店不可？" 她的声音带着一丝戏谑，但那丝戏谑在真嗣听来，仍足以在他犹豫时划出一道口子。"你应该昨天就去把那件重要东西买回来的。"

He opened one eye slightly to look down at the top of Asuka's head. "Well, I thought the lunch I made—remember, the one where I proposed to you?—and the, erm, 'quality time' we spent together before I left were enough for a private, romantic engagement party."  
他微微睁开一只眼，低头看向明日香头顶。"嗯，我觉得我做的午餐——记得吧，就是我向你求婚的那顿——还有我离开前我们一起度过的'美好时光'，已经足够作为一场私密的浪漫订婚派对了。"

"You—thought—wrong," Asuka, with her head still burrowed into Shinji's shoulder, kissed his neck in between each word of her refutation. "You Idiot." She added as an afterthought.  
"你——想——错了，" 明日香把头埋在真嗣肩上，每说一个字就在他脖子上亲一下。"你这个笨蛋。" 她补充道，仿佛是事后才想起这个词。

"Yeah, but I'm _your_ Idiot," he replied. He kissed the crown of her head. "You're stuck with me now, sucker."  
"是啊，但我可是你的傻瓜，"他回答道。他吻了吻她的头顶。"你现在可甩不掉我了，倒霉蛋。"

"Somehow, I think I'll manage," Asuka derided with a light jab of her elbow to his ribs.  
"不知怎么的，我觉得我能应付，"明日香嘲讽道，轻轻用肘部撞了一下他的肋骨。"

"I also thought that if I brought home a bunch of snacks and Misato's favorite beer just before your birthday that you'd get suspicious, and the surprise would be ruined." Shinji continued from his earlier explanation.  
"我还想，如果我在你生日之前带一堆零食和美里最喜欢的啤酒回家，你肯定会起疑心，惊喜就泡汤了。"真嗣继续解释他之前的想法。"

"You—thought—correctly." After the last kiss, Asuka rolled herself so that she was laying directly on top of Shinji, arms crossed over his chest and chin resting on her arms. Shinji locked his hands behind his head and met her content grin with a goofy smile of his own. "So, I take it the family is stopping by tonight?" She asked him, bending her legs at the knees and kicking them rhythmically in the air.  
"你——想——对了。" 最后一个吻后，明日香翻身让自己直接躺在真嗣身上，双臂交叉放在他的胸前，下巴靠在手臂上。真嗣双手交叉放在脑后，用自己傻乎乎的笑容回应她满足的微笑。"那么，我猜今晚家人会来访？" 她问他，膝盖弯曲，双腿在空中有节奏地踢动。

Shinji grimaced as her knees dug into his thighs with each kick but made no move to reposition her. Her question, meanwhile, was answered with the sound of Shinji's phone vibrating. Asuka groaned and spun off of him while he gave a nod in resignation and rose to grab his phone.  
每次踢腿时，明日香的膝盖都顶在真嗣的大腿上，让他皱起了眉头，但没有移动她。与此同时，她的提问被真嗣手机震动的声音回答了。明日香呻吟一声，从他身上滚下来，而他则无奈地点头，起身去拿手机。

"It's Rei," Shinji said while sitting back down on the bed.  
"是绫波，" 真嗣坐回床上说道。

"Blabbermouth," Asuka quietly complained before she crawled over to sit up next to him, resting her head on his shoulder.  
"多嘴多舌的家伙，" 明日香轻声抱怨着，然后爬过去坐在他旁边，把头靠在他的肩膀上。

"She says: 'Sorry, I delayed her as long as I could. We're on our way now. Please make sure you're presentable when we get there. Misato might think it's a fun game trying to catch you guys going at it like farm animals as often as she can, but I've seen my brother in flagrante delicto with my best friend too many times for one lifetime.' There're some symbols after that. I think it's supposed to be a face? And it's gagging?"  
"她说：‘抱歉，我尽量拖延了时间。我们现在正赶过去。请确保我们到的时候你们已经收拾妥当。美里可能会觉得试图抓到你们像牲口一样频繁亲热是件有趣的游戏，但我已经见过我哥哥和我最好的朋友在犯罪现场太多次，这一生都够了。’后面还有一些符号。我觉得那应该是个表情？而且是被堵住嘴的样子？"

"Well, come on then, Shinji." Asuka finally rose to stand next to the bed, extending a hand out to Shinji. He grasped it, and she pulled him into a tight hug. "With the way Misato drives, we've got ten minutes before they get through the door. Let's make them count—somewhere Rei can catch us."  
"好了，快点，真嗣。" 明日香终于站起身来，站在床边向真嗣伸出手。他握住她的手，她便将他紧紧拥入怀中。"以美里的开车速度，我们还有十分钟他们才会到门口。让我们充分利用这段时间——在某个丽能看到的地方。"

[JazzCabbage](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15695898/JazzCabbage): Personally, i'm kinda weird about oneshots, I don't like most of them because they're usually too short for you to really see what makes this person's interpretation of the characters unique and worth reading. This is not one of those, I was hooked from the first line into the last and I enjoyed every second. The way Asuka talks about Rei is adorable and shows her character growth from the original without seeming forced which is my usual complaint about dialogue of people talking about their unshown past in a fic like this. You executed the premise perfectly and made a waff delicasy while staying true to the characters, bravo sir. 11/10 good work  
就我个人而言，我对短篇小说有些奇怪的看法，我不太喜欢大多数短篇，因为它们通常太短，无法真正展现作者对角色的独特解读和阅读价值。这篇绝非如此，我从第一句话就被吸引到最后一刻，每一秒都享受其中。明日香谈论丽的方式既可爱又展现了她从原作中的成长，没有显得生硬，这是我通常对这类小说中未展示过去对话的抱怨。你完美地执行了前提，同时忠于角色，制作了一道美味的华夫饼。11/10，干得好，先生。

[IAmMurk](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5847084/IAmMurk): this was adorable! great mix of comedy and sweetness, and def had me going for a sec with the opening lol  
这真是太可爱了！喜剧与甜蜜的完美融合，开头确实让我笑了一会儿，哈哈
