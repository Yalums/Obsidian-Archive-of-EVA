**Author's Note:** To those of you who just read my previous story, no these two aren't related. Well, not really. I did get the idea for this one after finished my last one. Anyway, with that in mind, please read and review.  
作者的话：刚读完我上一篇故事的各位，这两篇并不相关。嗯，也不完全是。我是在完成上一篇后得到这篇的灵感的。无论如何，请带着这个前提阅读并留下评论。
**Author's Note:** I just realized that I haven't given any context as to the background of this story. This story is sort of an amalgamation of events from the Evangelion anime and manga. I cherry pick situations and events from Sadamoto's version of the story and crudely pasted them into Anno's version. Sorry for any confusion.  
作者注：我刚意识到还没有为这个故事提供任何背景信息。这个故事是基于《新世纪福音战士》动画和漫画的事件混合体。我从贞本义行的版本中挑选了一些情节和事件，并粗略地将其融入到庵野秀明的版本中。对于可能造成的混淆，深感抱歉。

### Chapter 1: Divisions

The surf washed over his feet as he stared out across the infinite ocean of blood. Shinji was mortified at the endless scarlet sea, a crimson eternity that held no ending in sight. The blood of everyone, innocent and guilty alike, had pooled into one enormous sea. He felt sick.  
海浪冲刷着他的脚，他凝视着眼前这片无垠的血海。真嗣面对这无边无际的猩红海洋，感到无比恐惧，这是一片看不到尽头的血色永恒。所有人的血，无论无辜与否，都汇聚成了这片巨大的海洋。他感到一阵恶心。

The ebb and flow of the tide filled the air with the unmistakable scent of blood and offal. When he tried to breath through his mouth to avoid the smell, Shinji found that the thin mist of the breaking waves formed a coppery taste in his mouth. He decided to keep his mouth tightly shut after that.  
潮汐的涨落让空气中弥漫着血腥和内脏的刺鼻气味。当他试图用嘴呼吸以避开这股味道时，真嗣发现破碎的波浪间薄雾在他口中形成了铜腥味。自那以后，他决定紧紧闭上嘴巴。

Looking to either side of him, the former Third Child saw nothing but white sands marred by ruby stains of the ocean. Behind him, there was nothing. No buildings, no electrical towers, no signs of any form of life. He was alone.  
向两侧望去，曾经的第三适格者只见一片被海洋的深红污渍玷污的白色沙滩。身后，一无所有。没有建筑，没有电线塔，没有任何生命迹象。他孤身一人。

Solitude. 孤独。

Shinji's heart began beating hard in his chest. Taking panicked breaths, the child found he couldn't squelch the growing unease and terror growing inside him. This wasn't right. None of this was right.  
真嗣的心脏开始在胸腔中剧烈跳动。他急促地呼吸着，发现自己无法平息内心不断增长的焦虑和恐惧。这不正常。这一切都不正常。

"This wasn't what I asked for…" The boy mumbled to himself, his fear growing as each second passed. "No, I didn't want this! I never asked for this!" Looking wildly about him for some sign of human existence to verify his own, he began to take harried steps towards the approaching tide of blood. "Is someone there? Can anyone hear me? Please, someone, anyone!" The crimson liquid now washed across his ankles as he stumbled in the pull of the riptide. "Asuka, Misato, Ayanami, Kaji, anyone!"  
“这不是我想要的……”男孩喃喃自语，随着每一秒的流逝，他的恐惧愈发强烈。“不，我从未想要这样！我从未要求过这些！”他疯狂地环顾四周，寻找人类存在的迹象以确认自己的存在，开始急促地向涌来的血潮迈步。“有人在吗？有人能听见我吗？求求了，无论是谁！”鲜红的液体此刻已漫过他的脚踝，他在激流的拉扯中踉跄前行。“明日香，美里，绫波，加持，无论是谁！”

The words echoed, an especially unsettling effect, considering there was nothing for the sound to reflect off of. The constant hiss of the moving waters filled the silence. Nobody was coming. The world was empty save for him. This was Hell. He'd died and this was his punishment, Shinji was sure of it.  
这些话语回荡着，尤其令人不安的是，这里没有任何东西能让声音反射。移动的水流持续发出嘶嘶声，填补了沉默。没有人会来。除了他，这个世界空无一人。这是地狱。他确信自己已经死了，这是对他的惩罚。

Shaking, he finally gave in and fell to his knees, the surf rose to meet him and surged across his chest. Cradling himself, his hands wrapped around his shoulders the boy began to shake. This was too much. This was nothing that he deserved. Memories suddenly flashed through Shinji's mind. A shattered entry plug. Disintegrating copies of Rei. A bloody kiss from Misato. The mangled remains of Unit-02. The bloody shreds of flesh that had once Kaoru dangling from Unit-01's open hand. Each image seemed to tear through his thoughts, rip across his mind with ragged edges and sharp claws. And still, there was no sound other than the surf.  
颤抖着，他终于屈服，跪倒在地，海浪涌起迎接他，汹涌地漫过他的胸膛。他抱紧自己，双手环绕肩膀，男孩开始颤抖。这一切太过沉重，他自认不配承受。记忆突然在真嗣脑海中闪现：破碎的插入栓、消散的零号机复制品、美里血腥的吻、残破的二号机、曾经是薰的血肉碎片，悬挂在初号机张开的手掌上。每幅画面似乎都撕裂他的思绪，用粗糙的边缘和锋利的爪子划过他的脑海。然而，除了海浪声，依旧没有任何声音。

"PLEASE SOMEONE TALK TO ME, DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE!"  
求求谁来跟我说说话，别丢下我一个人！

Shinji propelled himself from his bed with such force that he found himself sprawled across the floor, tangled in his blankets. Struggling to free himself, he crawled pathetically across the floor. Struggling to his knees, he could no longer stand the churning in his head and stomach. Wrapped in his sheets, bruised from his fall, the boy emptied his stomach in a violent heave, a pool of vomit pooling before him.  
真嗣猛地从床上跃起，力道之大让他发现自己已经摔倒在地板上，被自己的毯子缠绕。他挣扎着试图解脱，可怜地爬过地板。艰难地跪起，他再也无法忍受头和胃中的翻腾。裹着床单，因跌落而淤青，男孩猛烈地呕吐，面前形成一滩呕吐物。

Asuka stood in a sea of people. A single girl in the swarming multitudes of humanity. The pedestrians went their own way, each having their own business and schedule to keep. They brushed each other from time to time, offering terse apologies when they did so, but continued on their way immediately after. However, Asuka couldn't see any point in their hurry, as there was nothing at all in this world. The whole of humanity existed in an infinite void. The world was a sterile, perfect white emptiness in which the crowd strode upon an invisible plane that stretched on forever in every direction, disappearing from view when they ventured too far. And in the center of the torrent of people, the red haired girl stood unnoticed and uncared for.  
明日香独自站在人海之中，宛如茫茫人潮中的一抹孤影。行人各自匆匆，忙于自己的事务与日程，偶尔擦肩而过，简短致歉后又继续前行。然而，明日香眼中，他们的匆忙毫无意义，因为这世间本就空无一物。整个人类仿佛存在于无尽的虚空之中，世界是一片洁净无瑕的纯白空旷，人群在这无形的平面上行走，向着四面八方无限延伸，一旦走远便消失于视野之外。在这汹涌的人流中心，红发少女静静伫立，无人察觉，亦无人关心。

"Where am I?" Asuka's question fell on deaf ears as the people around her hurried off to their business, whatever it may be. Furrowing her brow in annoyance the Teutonic redhead addressed another passing pedestrian. "Hey you, slow down and tell me what's going on." Despite her orders, the passing gentleman continued on as if he hadn't heard the pretty teenager. Fighting off a twinge of fear, Asuka growled as she reached out for the well dressed passerby. "I said tell me what's going on, arschloch!" Reaching out to grab the man by the collar of his well pressed suit, Asuka was shocked to find her hand passed right through the pedestrian.  
"我在哪儿？" 明日香的疑问如同石沉大海，周围的人们匆匆忙忙地赶往各自的目的地，无暇顾及她。这位日耳曼血统的红发少女皱起眉头，不悦地向另一位路过的行人发问："喂，你，慢点，告诉我这是怎么回事。" 尽管她下了命令，那位路过的绅士却仿佛没听见这位漂亮少女的话，继续前行。明日香强压下心中的恐惧，低吼一声，伸手去抓那位衣着考究的路人。"我说了，告诉我这是怎么回事，混蛋！" 当她伸手去抓那人笔挺的西装领子时，却震惊地发现自己的手直接穿过了那人。

Her breath caught in her throat as Asuka realized what was going on around her. Quickly spinning and addressing anyone who came near, Asuka knew that nobody could hear or see her. The Second Child's stomach rolled as a particularly hurried pedestrian ran right through her. Her body tingled and smarted, almost as if she'd been given an electric shock.  
明日香意识到周围发生的事情时，她的呼吸卡在了喉咙里。她迅速转身，向每一个靠近的人发问，但明日香知道，没有人能听见或看见她。作为第二适格者的她，当一位特别匆忙的行人直接穿过她的身体时，她的胃一阵翻腾。她的身体感到刺痛和麻痹，仿佛刚刚遭受了一次电击。

Holding her throbbing chest, Asuka bit down the fear that began to surge from the pit of her stomach. This wasn't real, it couldn't be real. Glancing around at the people buzzing about her, the rational thought did little to assuage her fears. Her previous controlled addressing of passersby quickly degenerated into frantic cries for attention. "Hey, can't any of you see me? Why can't anyone see me? Hey, look over here! "  
捂着剧烈跳动的胸口，明日香强压下从胃底涌起的恐惧。这不可能是真的，绝对不是真的。她环顾四周，看着那些在她身边忙碌的人们，理智的想法却无法平息她的恐惧。她之前对路人的有条不紊的询问迅速演变成了焦急的呼救。“嘿，你们难道都看不见我吗？为什么没人能看到我？嘿，看这边！”

Beads of sweat began running down her face as panic gripped her heart in its icy, vice-like grip. Looking quickly about her, Asuka stopped dead as she set her eyes on a familiar face. Shinji calmly strolled along side the faceless people, smiling amiably to nobody in particular. A spark of hope flared in the redhead's heart as she rushed over to her acquaintance. "Nice to see you stupid, any idea on where we are or what's going on? This place gives me the creeps." Already calling out to the familiar boy, the anxiety returned quickly when Shinji didn't even cast a glance towards the Second Child. "Hey you moron, tell me what's going on." Still no response.  
随着恐慌紧紧抓住她的心脏，汗水开始顺着她的脸颊流下。明日香迅速环顾四周，突然停下脚步，目光落在一个熟悉的面孔上。真嗣平静地走在那些面目模糊的人群中，友好地向着虚空微笑。红发少女心中燃起一丝希望，她急忙向熟人跑去。“很高兴见到你这个笨蛋，你知道我们在哪里或者发生了什么吗？这个地方让我毛骨悚然。”她已经向那个熟悉的男孩喊话，但当真嗣甚至没有朝第二适格者看一眼时，焦虑迅速回归。“嘿，你这个傻瓜，告诉我发生了什么。”依旧没有回应。

Clenching her hands into fists, the isolated girl stubbornly continued to address the Third Child. "I- I'm talking to you Shinji. Why aren't you listening to me? I said pay attention!" Continuing past the red haired pilot, Shinji didn't bat an eyelash at the outburst.  
紧握双拳，孤立的女孩固执地继续对第三适格者说话。“我-我在跟你说话，真嗣。你为什么不听我说？我说了，注意听！”真嗣继续走过红发驾驶员，对这场爆发不为所动。

"Shinji? …Shinji. Shinji!" The boy continued walking, his back to the screaming girl. "WHY WON'T YOU LOOK AT ME!?"  
真嗣？…真嗣。真嗣！”男孩继续走着，背对着尖叫的女孩。“你为什么就是不看我一眼！？”

Asuka awoke to find herself curled up, cheeks already wet with tears. She tightened the grip on her sheets as she continued to sob quietly to herself.  
明日香醒来时发现自己蜷缩着，脸颊上已经挂着泪水。她紧紧抓住床单，继续默默地抽泣。

**Author's Note:** As I said before, the story I wrote before is not related to this one in terms of continuity. The whole dream idea got me thinking about exactly what Shinji and Asuka dream about, so I had to write this one out. Anyway, this was short because there will be more to follow. This was just the set up. I'm worried about what exactly I'll end up with, but hopefully it'll be something decent. Please review and offer any ideas or criticism.  
作者的话：如我之前所说，我之前写的故事与这个在连续性上无关。整个梦境的想法让我思考真嗣和明日香到底梦见了什么，所以我不得不写下这个。无论如何，这个很短，因为后面还会有更多。这只是铺垫。我担心最终会写出什么，但希望会是像样的东西。请评论并提供任何想法或批评。

### Chapter 2: Sickness and Health  

Dragging his hand across his mouth to wipe away the traces of saliva and vomit, Shinji sat back on his heels. The small, mostly empty room he now resided in had been his sanctuary for almost six months. Truth be told, the Third Child missed his old room in Tokyo-3, but very little of the city had survived the explosion caused by Unit-00's collapsing core. Absolutely nothing was left of the metropolis after Third Impact. Because of this, the members of NERV who had returned from the Sea of LCL made their homes in the newly appointed capital of Japan, Tokyo-2. Having useful military background and not much else, most of the NERV crew joined the JSDF. When Misato returned, she found a cheap apartment on the outskirts of the city and followed the example of her one-time subordinates by taking a position in the defense force. For lack of anywhere else to go, Asuka and Shinji stayed with their guardian and made themselves as comfortable as possible in their new home.  
擦去嘴角的唾液和呕吐痕迹，真嗣跪坐回脚跟上。这个狭小且多半空荡的房间，如今已是他近六个月的避风港。说实话，第三适格者怀念他在第三新东京市的旧居，但那座城市在零号机核心崩溃引发的爆炸中幸存无几。第三次冲击后，大都会彻底化为乌有。因此，从 LCL 之海归来的 NERV 成员们，在日本新首都东京二号市安家落户。拥有军事背景却别无他长的大多数 NERV 员工，加入了日本自卫队。当美里归来时，她在城市边缘租下一间廉价公寓，并效仿昔日下属，投身于防卫部队。无处可去的明日香和真嗣，便与监护人同住，在新家中尽可能地安顿下来。

It had been, and still was at times, a very strained atmosphere. Neither Shinji nor Asuka had the words necessary for any meaningful conversation, so the two did their best to stay out of one another's way. The left over disappointment, anger, and hurts from Third Impact proved a difficult subject for the two. Misato had picked up on the atmosphere, but found there was little she could do to help matters. Her cheerful jabs at the two former pilots didn't quite come out as light hearted as she'd intended and seemed to darken the atmosphere further. Knowing when she was beaten, Misato had gradually stopped dishing out her half-joking quips. As the months passed, each child found the presence of the other tolerable and the two reached an uneasy understanding: act like nothing had happened. Of course it wasn't the most elegant or even functional plan ever to be conceived, but the two teenagers had no clue what else to do. Neither was quite ready to tackle the issues that lay between them like a vast river.  
那里的气氛曾经很紧张，有时依然如此。真嗣和明日香都找不到开启有意义对话的词汇，因此两人尽力避免彼此的接触。第三次冲击留下的失望、愤怒和伤痛，对两人而言是难以触及的话题。美里察觉到了这种氛围，却发现自己无能为力。她试图以轻松的调侃来缓和气氛，却未能如愿以轻快，反而让氛围更显沉重。意识到自己的努力徒劳后，美里逐渐停止了那些半开玩笑的俏皮话。随着时间的推移，两个孩子逐渐适应了对方的存在，并达成了一种不安的默契：装作一切未曾发生。当然，这并非什么高明或有效的计划，但两个少年对此别无他法。他们还未准备好面对横亘在彼此之间那如大河般的问题。

And now, in the middle of the night, Shinji shivered in his autumn chilled room, which currently smelled strongly of bile, sweat, and fear. His stomach still churning and his head throbbing, the boy slowly began climbing to his feet. He needed to clean up. The journey to his feet was much harder than the Third Child expected. Every muscle burned and twitched as the boy forced his body to stand. His joints popped in protest as he finally got his feet under him and made his way towards the door. The few steps seemed like miles. His legs felt like lead weights and his stomach cramped tightly. Scuffling to the door, he rested a moment, rubbing his sore back.  
此刻，夜深人静，真嗣在他那秋意渐浓的房间里瑟瑟发抖，空气中弥漫着胆汁、汗水和恐惧的浓烈气味。胃里依旧翻江倒海，头痛欲裂，少年缓缓起身。他必须清理一番。站起来的过程远比第三适格者预想的艰难。每块肌肉都在燃烧，抽搐着，少年强迫自己站立。关节在抗议中发出声响，他终于站稳脚跟，向门口挪去。这几步路仿佛有数英里之遥。双腿沉重如铅，胃部紧缩成团。拖着脚步走到门前，他稍作休息，揉了揉酸痛的背。

Grasping the wooden frame in hand, Shinji urged his arms to move. The simple wooden door seemed to weigh several tons, refusing to budge an inch to his weary efforts. Glaring at the door as if it intentionally meant to keep him inside his room, Shinji began pressing his weight into the attempts. The suddenly very light door slid open, sending the exhausted boy to the tumbling to the ground. Mumbling curses under his breath, Shinji once again making the struggle to his feet, and pressed on, forcing himself to take step after step towards the kitchen. Under the sink, the boy knew he would find a bucket and several detergents that would serve nicely to wash away the foul smelling stain away completely.  
紧握着木质门框，真嗣催促自己的手臂发力。那扇看似简单的木门仿佛重达数吨，对他的疲惫努力丝毫不为所动。他瞪着门，仿佛它故意要将他困在房间里，真嗣开始将全身重量压在门上。突然变得轻飘飘的门滑开了，让筋疲力尽的少年摔倒在地。他低声咒骂着，再次挣扎着站起来，继续前行，强迫自己一步接一步地走向厨房。在水槽下，他知道会找到一个水桶和几种清洁剂，它们能很好地洗去那股恶臭的污渍。

Naturally, it was Shinji's job to know where the cleaning supplies were because, after all, it was his duty to take care of household chores. He didn't mind for the most part. It was actually something he enjoyed doing. It made him feel useful. Of course it did tend to get tedious, and Shinji found the method of assigning the chores a bit suspect. With a weary smile, Shinji couldn't help but wonder if both Misato and Asuka had managed to find a way to cheat in "Rock, Paper, Scissors."  
自然，真嗣知道清洁用品放在哪里，毕竟，负责家务是他的责任。他大部分时间并不介意，实际上，他甚至喜欢做这些事。这让他感觉自己有用。当然，这确实有时会变得乏味，真嗣觉得分配家务的方式有些可疑。带着疲惫的微笑，他不禁怀疑，美里和明日香是否找到了在“石头、剪刀、布”中作弊的方法。

The smile quickly disappeared, replaced by a grimace as the ex-pilot strained his muscles with every step. Stopping to rest against the wall of the hallway, Shinji took the deep, ragged breaths of someone who'd run a marathon. Something was wrong. This was worse than the other times. For some reason, the boy had become rather frail since Instrumentality. He'd taken to falling ill rather frequently over the past few months. Aches, pains, headaches, stomach cramps, and nausea were problems he'd come to be familiar with. Of course, being in charge the apartment's upkeep, as well as needing to focus on his school work, Shinji had no time to succumb to illness. He'd done his best to hide his recurring sickness and seemed to be doing a decent job in keeping it from his roommates. The recurring illness made the Third Child nervous, often wondering what to attribute the ailment to.  
笑容迅速消失，取而代之的是痛苦的扭曲，前飞行员每迈出一步都竭尽全力。在走廊的墙壁上停下休息，真嗣深吸着粗重的气息，仿佛刚跑完马拉松。情况不对劲，这次比以往更糟。不知何故，自从人类补完计划后，这个男孩变得异常虚弱。过去几个月里，他频繁生病。疼痛、头痛、胃痉挛和恶心成了他熟悉的困扰。当然，作为负责公寓维护的人，同时还要专注于学业，真嗣没有时间屈服于疾病。他尽力隐藏反复发作的病情，似乎在向室友隐瞒方面做得还不错。这反复的疾病让第三适格者感到紧张，常常思索着该将这病症归咎于何因。

No matter. With Herculean resolve, the deathly weary boy continued onward, each step a labor. He wouldn't be looked after by others. If he was sick, he'd take care of it himself. It wasn't out of some ridiculous need for independence or to prove his autonomy. Shinji simply refused to put any strain on either Misato or Asuka. Misato already worked hard enough, finding her rank didn't translate from NERV to the JSDF. The low ranking position offered brutal hours and a less than respectable salary, but the plucky purple haired woman did her best to not complain and paid the bills with limited fuss. Shinji felt guilty simply living there without forcing Misato to worry about the state of his health as well. And Asuka…Asuka had her own troubles to worry over. Shinji thought of strangling the strawberry haired beauty on the beach and the bandages she had carried then. He still had too much to make up to her before he would allow himself to cause her any further trouble. No, Shinji shook his head, they didn't need to be worried or bothered over him. He hated being a burden to others, his surrogate family in particular.  
无妨。带着赫拉克勒斯般的决心，疲惫至极的少年继续前行，每一步都异常艰辛。他不愿被人照顾。若生病，他会自行解决。并非出于荒谬的独立需求或证明自主性，真嗣只是不愿给美里或明日香增添负担。美里已足够辛苦，她在 NERV 的军衔并未在 JSDF 得到相应体现，低微的职位伴随着残酷的工作时间和微薄的薪水，但这位勇敢的紫发女子尽力不抱怨，以有限的麻烦支付账单。真嗣仅是住在那里就感到内疚，更不愿让美里再为他的健康操心。而明日香……她有自己的烦恼要面对。真嗣回想起在海滩上扼住草莓色发丝的美丽少女，以及她当时携带的绷带。在他能补偿她之前，他不允许自己再给她添麻烦。不，真嗣摇头，他们无需为他担忧或被打扰。他讨厌成为他人的负担，尤其是对他视为家人的他们。

The Third Child grimaced at the thought of equating Asuka to family. It felt extremely odd to think of Asuka as familial in any way, particularly because of the daydreams the boy had found himself entertaining. Blushing furiously at the very idea, Shinji admonished himself. 'God, she's right. I am a pervert.'  
第三适格者一想到将明日香视为家人就皱起了眉头。把明日香看作任何形式的家人都让他感到非常奇怪，尤其是因为他发现自己沉迷于那些白日梦。一想到这个念头就满脸通红，真嗣严厉地告诫自己。'天啊，她说的没错。我真是个变态。'

Finally arriving in the kitchen, Shinji bent down near the sink, a ripple of discomfort riding across his lower back. Ignoring the unpleasant sensation, Shinji searched through the cabinet beneath the sink for several moments before finally rising again, bucket in hand. The boy smiled as he placed the bucket into the sink and turned the faucet. Waiting as the vessel filled with water, he wiped his sweat streaked brow and leaned against the counter top. Taking deep breaths, Shinji marveled at the ordeal such a simple task had become for him. Maybe he needed to more Vitamin C. That was supposed to boost the immune system, wasn't it?  
终于来到厨房，真嗣弯腰靠近水槽，下背部传来一阵不适。他无视这种不愉快的感觉，在水槽下方的橱柜里翻找了一会儿，最后再次站起来，手里拿着一个水桶。男孩微笑着将水桶放入水槽并打开水龙头。等待水桶装满水时，他擦了擦额头上的汗水，靠在台面上。深呼吸着，真嗣惊叹于这样一个简单的任务对他来说竟然变得如此艰难。也许他需要更多的维生素 C。那不是应该增强免疫系统的吗？

Finally satisfied with the level of water in the tin bucket, Shinji turned the faucet off. Moving to grab the pail, Shinji stopped when he realized there was no way he could carry the full container back with him in his current condition. His mouth, a thin line set in determination, Shinji latched his right hand onto the handle of the bucket. He'd managed to control a several ton, 30 story high monster, he'd be damned if a bucket of water was going to beat him. Groaning with the effort, the ex-pilot lifted the bucket clear of the sink and began struggling back towards his room. Gritting his teeth, the boy forced step after step, careful to avoid sloshing the contents of the pail onto the floor. Entering into the hall once more, Shinji couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride in his self sufficiency. It made him feel good to not have to bother the two women who mattered to him.  
终于对锡桶中的水位感到满意，真嗣旋紧了水龙头。他正要伸手去提桶，却突然意识到以自己目前的状况，根本无法将装满的容器带回去。他的嘴角紧抿成一条线，显露出决心，真嗣用右手紧紧抓住桶的把手。他曾驾驭过重达数吨、高达三十层的巨兽，绝不允许一桶水将自己打败。伴随着努力的呻吟，这位前驾驶员将桶从水槽中提起，开始艰难地向自己的房间挪动。他咬紧牙关，一步接一步地强迫自己前进，小心翼翼地避免将桶中的水溅到地板上。再次踏入走廊，真嗣不禁为自己的自立感到一丝自豪。这种感觉很好，他无需麻烦那两位对他重要的女性。

Suddenly, everything stopped. A bright light flashed through the boy's mind and in an instant, Shinji lost all possibility for rational thought. Pain exploded behind his right eye as if someone had driven an ice pick into the socket. His stomach became a pit of ravenous vipers, each tearing away at a different spot in his abdomen. His arms felt as if they were on fire, the skin ripped from them and the pulpy muscle scoured to the bone. The earlier aches and pains were immaterial compared to this new wave of agony that shred through his body, searing any nerve ending capable of pain. Dropping to his knees, the boy let go of the bucket as he lost muscle control in his hands, the digits uncurling of their own accord. The water splashed across the carpeting.  
突然间，一切都静止了。一道耀眼的光芒划过少年的脑海，刹那间，真嗣失去了所有理性思考的可能。剧痛在他右眼后爆炸开来，仿佛有人将冰锥刺入了眼窝。他的胃变成了饥饿蝰蛇的巢穴，每一条都在他腹部的不同位置撕咬。他的双臂感觉像是着了火，皮肤被撕裂，血肉被刮至骨髓。与这新一轮的痛苦相比，之前的疼痛微不足道，这股痛苦撕裂着他的身体，灼烧着每一个能感受到疼痛的神经末梢。他跪倒在地，手中的水桶随着手部肌肉控制的丧失而松开，手指不由自主地展开。水溅洒在地毯上。

Holding his abdomen with one arm and covering his throbbing right eye with the other, Shinji couldn't even gather the air necessary to scream. As suddenly as the agony appeared it vanished, leaving the shuddering form of Shinji Ikari huddled on the floor. His body felt numb, as if he'd been through a blizzard or freezing rainstorm. His body wouldn't move.  
真嗣一手捂着腹部，另一手遮住剧烈跳动的右眼，甚至无法聚集足够的空气来尖叫。痛苦来得突然，去得也快，留下颤抖的真嗣·伊卡里蜷缩在地板上。他的身体感觉麻木，仿佛刚经历了一场暴风雪或冰冷的暴雨。他的身体动弹不得。

The quietly sobbing Asuka managed to catch the thud emanating from the hallway outside her door. Sniffling a few times, the pretty young woman slid her feet over the edge of her bed and wiped her eyes. 'Great, now what? Probably Misato falling down drunk again. What an irresponsible woman.' Of course, Asuka had refused to acknowledge the fact that Misato had severely curbed her drinking habit, substituting alcohol with canned coffee. Pushing herself to her feet, her muscles aching with every movement as she stomped towards the door, Asuka cursed her anatomy, not for the first time. She found it supremely unfair that a girl who didn't even want kids in the first place had to go through the same crap as other women. Of course, the nightmares only compounded her troubles, making this time of the month even more intolerable.  
低声啜泣的明日香捕捉到了门外走廊传来的砰然声响。这位美丽的年轻女子抽泣了几下，将双脚滑过床沿，擦了擦眼睛。'真是的，又怎么了？八成是美里又醉倒在地了。真是个不负责任的女人。'当然，明日香拒绝承认美里已经大大减少了饮酒，转而用罐装咖啡代替酒精的事实。她挣扎着站起身，每动一下肌肉都疼痛不已，一边走向门口一边咒骂着自己的身体，这已不是第一次。她觉得极度不公，一个原本就不想要孩子的女孩，却不得不和其他女人一样经历这些破事。当然，噩梦更是雪上加霜，让这段时期变得更加难以忍受。

Stopping at the door, Asuka faltered as she heard the distinct sound of a low groan coming from the other side of the wall. Cocking an eyebrow, she quickly slid the wooden portal open, finding the collapsed form of Shinji shuddering helplessly on the soaked floor. Kneeling down to inspect the fallen boy, a stab of concern coursed through her. "Mein Gott, are you ok?" Placing a hand on the boy's shoulder, Asuka leaned close and tried to help him to his feet. Her efforts proved futile, however, and only succeeded in rolling the Third Child onto his back. The boy's breathing was shallow, but quickly began returning to normal as he opened his eyes. Shinji tried his best to tell Asuka that he was fine, but only managed something similar to a harsh cough. He was forced to settle on nodding to the affirmative instead.  
站在门口，明日香听到墙另一侧传来低沉的呻吟声，不由得停下脚步。她挑起眉毛，迅速推开木门，发现真嗣瘫倒在湿漉漉的地板上，无助地颤抖着。明日香跪下检查倒地的男孩，一股担忧涌上心头。“我的天，你还好吗？”她将手放在真嗣肩上，俯身试图扶他起来。然而，她的努力徒劳无功，只让第三适格者翻了个身。男孩的呼吸微弱，但随着他睁开眼睛，呼吸开始逐渐恢复正常。真嗣尽力向明日香表示自己没事，却只能发出类似干咳的声音。最终，他只好点头表示肯定。

Relief flooded Asuka for a number of reasons, not least of which being that if Shinji was too sick, there would be no one to cook or take care of the chores. Asuka often prided herself on her unabashedly upfront feelings, but managed to feel a twinge of guilt at her selfishness. Shinji was someone she cared for, far more than she would ever admit to anyone, including herself. Perhaps especially herself. Shoving the thought aside, Asuka took in the situation with a new sense of clarity and became curious. "What exactly were you doing out here, Stupid?"  
多种原因让明日香感到松了一口气，其中最主要的是如果真嗣病得太重，就没有人做饭或做家务了。明日香常常自豪于她直率无讳的情感表达，但此刻她还是感到了一丝自私的愧疚。真嗣是她关心的人，远超过她对任何人，包括她自己，所愿意承认的程度。或许尤其是对她自己。她将这个念头抛到一边，以一种新的清晰感审视着情况，并产生了好奇。“你到底在这里做什么，笨蛋？”

Waiting for his breath to return to him, Shinji explained the situation. He explained waking up sick, his strained muscles, nausea, and quest to clean up the mess he'd left on his floor. He purposefully omitted the nightmare. Asuka fixed her cool blue eyes on Shinji and noticed something like concern pass over his features. "Asuka…are you ok?" For some reason the girl could not explain, the question raised her ire. Even in the face of his own problems Shinji was always trying to wait on others. What an idiot. "I'm fine," the terse reply was harsh and more than a little irritated. "Why do you ask?"  
等待呼吸平复后，真嗣解释了情况。他描述了自己醒来时的不适，肌肉的紧绷，恶心感，以及清理自己留在地板上的污物的任务。他故意省略了噩梦的部分。明日香用她那冷静的蓝眼睛盯着真嗣，注意到他的表情中似乎闪过一丝担忧。“明日香……你还好吗？”不知为何，这个问题让女孩无法解释地感到愤怒。即使在面对自己的问题时，真嗣也总是在试图照顾别人。真是个傻瓜。“我没事，”这句简短的回答严厉而略带恼怒。“你为什么这么问？”

Shinji looked away from her, staring at the ceiling. "Your eyes are red." Scowling, Asuka rapped the boy hard on the head with her knuckles. Of course her red eyes weren't Shinji's fault, but she still blamed him for noticing. The jerk. "I'm fine, shut up Stupid. Let's just get you back to your bed."  
真嗣避开她的目光，盯着天花板。“你的眼睛红了。”明日香皱着眉头，用指关节重重地敲了敲男孩的头。当然，她那双红眼睛并不是真嗣的错，但她仍然因为他注意到这一点而责怪他。这个混蛋。“我没事，闭嘴，笨蛋。我们还是赶紧把你弄回床上吧。”

Ignoring the ache in her muscles, Asuka lifted the boy from the ground and carried him to his bed, and if she let him down a little harder than was necessary, she felt it was her entitlement to do so. Leaving Shinji in his bed, she exited the room and went about filling up the bucket Shinji had dropped. When she reentered the room, a wash cloth was slung over her shoulder and she carried in her off hand a commercial detergent. Much to Shinji's amazement and chagrin, Asuka began cleaning up the pool of sick that had collected on his floor.  
无视肌肉的酸痛，明日香将男孩从地上抱起，带他回到床上，如果她把他放下时稍微重了点，她觉得这是她应得的。把真嗣留在床上后，她离开了房间，去装满真嗣掉落的那个水桶。当她再次进入房间时，一块洗布搭在肩上，另一只手里拿着一瓶商用洗涤剂。令真嗣既惊讶又懊恼的是，明日香开始清理他地板上积聚的呕吐物。

As the beautiful redhead scrubbed, Shinji felt a stab of shame and embarrassment. After everything he'd done to her she was still willing to help him when he needed it. Not that he deserved it. He should be cleaning up after himself and doing his best to make her comfortable as well. He had so much to make up to her: not being able to save her from the 15th Angel's attack, not saving her from the MP Evas…almost killing her on the beach. The incident in the hospital. His stomach turned once more at his despicable crimes. In the best of circumstances, he wasn't the type of person Asuka wanted or needed. In the strange situations when she had needed his assistance, the boy always managed to fail her spectacularly. He didn't deserve to be helped.  
当美丽的红发少女为他擦拭时，真嗣感到一阵羞愧和尴尬。尽管他曾对她做过那么多事，她仍在他需要时愿意伸出援手。当然，他不配得到这样的帮助。他本应自己清理，尽力让她感到舒适。他欠她太多：未能从第 15 使徒的攻击中救出她，未能从 Mark.06 使徒手中救出她……差点在海滩上杀了她。医院的那次事件。想到自己的可耻行径，他的胃再次翻腾。即便在最好的情况下，他也不是明日香想要或需要的那种人。每当她需要他帮助的奇怪时刻，这男孩总是以惊人的方式让她失望。他不配得到帮助。

Clearing his throat, Shinji managed a croak. "Asuka. You don't have to do that. I'll take care of it." The girl reached out and flicked him between the eyes. She was getting really tired of this altruistic bullshit. "If you say one more word about this, I'm going to hurt you. Badly." Returning her gaze to the stain on the floor, she continued scrubbing despite Shinji's unconvinced look. About to open his mouth to protest again, Asuka held up a hand to silence him. As if reading his mind, she quickly shot another glance at the Third Child. "Alright, look. The only thing you owe me for is me cleaning up this disgusting mess of yours. I don't want you to mope around because of what happened while we piloted Evas, got it?" The former pilot of Unit-01 nodded slowly. 'Jesus,' Asuka thought to herself, 'Shinji can be a real asshole sometimes.'  
清了清嗓子，真嗣勉强发出嘶哑的声音：“明日香，你不用这么做，我来处理。”女孩伸手在他眉间轻弹了一下，她对这种自以为是的善举已经厌烦透顶。“你要是再提这事，我可要狠狠揍你了。”她收回目光，继续擦洗地板上的污渍，无视真嗣不以为然的表情。他正要开口再次抗议，明日香举起手示意他闭嘴。仿佛看穿了他的心思，她迅速瞥了一眼第三适格者，“听着，你欠我的只有清理你这恶心的烂摊子。我不想因为驾驶 EVA 时发生的事让你闷闷不乐，明白吗？”前零号机驾驶员缓缓点头。‘天啊，’明日香心想，‘真嗣有时候真是个混蛋。’

Picking up the bucket and rag, Asuka made her way to the door. The thought of being alone caused Shinji to quickly call out to the departing Second Child. "Hey, Asuka." Turning to the boy's call, the redhead raised an eyebrow. "Would you…if you don't mind… would you stay with me for a while?" Shinji blushed furiously at his own request. Of course it was childish, but the boy knew that he would never find rest if he were alone in the dark. Not after the nightmare that woke him in the first place. Turning away from him, Asuka stepped out of the room. "Pervert."  
拿起水桶和抹布，明日香朝门口走去。想到要独自一人，真嗣急忙叫住了即将离开的第二适格者。“嘿，明日香。”听到男孩的呼唤，红发少女挑了挑眉。“如果你不介意的话……能陪我一会儿吗？”真嗣为自己的请求感到脸红。这当然很幼稚，但他知道，在黑暗中独自一人，他将无法安宁。尤其是在那个噩梦将他惊醒之后。明日香转过身，走出了房间。“变态。”

Shinji's heart sank. Of course he'd expected a reaction similar to the one the young woman had given, but that didn't make the actual rejection any less disappointing. Closing his eyes, Shinji tried to clear his mind, but found images from his nightmares appearing in his thoughts more often than not. The momentary silence also caused the boy to realize something else. He was feeling much better. The ache in his muscles persisted, but the headache and nausea had subsided almost completely. The stabbing pain in his arms, abdomen and eye were only memories now having vanished entirely. Too relieved to wonder why the symptoms had vanished, Shinji sank deeper into his mattress with a heavy sigh.  
真嗣的心沉了下去。他当然预料到了那位年轻女子会有类似的反应，但这并不意味着实际的拒绝就不那么令人失望。真嗣闭上眼睛，试图清空思绪，却发现噩梦中的画面频繁地出现在脑海中。短暂的沉默也让男孩意识到了另一件事。他感觉好多了。肌肉的疼痛依旧，但头痛和恶心几乎完全消退了。手臂、腹部和眼睛的刺痛现在只是记忆，已经完全消失了。太过宽慰以至于不去想为什么症状会消失，真嗣重重地叹了口气，更深地陷入了床垫中。

Leaving the bucket, wash cloth, and detergent in the sink, Asuka turned on her heel and headed back towards her room. She had no intention of putting that stuff away too. Shinji could take care of that tomorrow. Exiting the kitchen and stepping around the portion of wet carpet, Asuka opened and closed her door loudly as she entered her room, signaling to Shinji that she was serious in her decision of not lying down next to him.  
把水桶、抹布和清洁剂留在水槽里，明日香转身朝自己的房间走去。她无意再收拾那些东西。真嗣可以明天处理。离开厨房，绕过湿漉漉的地毯部分，明日香大声地打开并关上自己的房门，向真嗣表明她对于不躺在他旁边的决定是认真的。

Flopping onto her own bed, Asuka silently stared at the ceiling. For several minutes, she listed every way in which Shinji had ever failed or disappointed her. The list was rather extensive. However, despite her enumerations of the Third Child's shortcomings, the angry girl simply could not stifle the portion of her mind that remembered everything wonderful about the cute boy. His meek attitude that had once so bothered the girl had managed to somehow ingrain itself in her perception of his character, becoming part of his boyish charm. He cooked for her, cleaned for her, did everything around the house without as much as a single complaint. He'd fought at her side against the Angels and had even saved her life once. She remembered sharing the entry plug of Unit-02 in the ocean, his hands resting over hers.  
瘫倒在床上，明日香默默凝视着天花板。几分钟内，她细数了真嗣每一次失败或让她失望的方式，这份清单颇为冗长。然而，尽管她列举了第三适格者的种种不足，这位愤怒的少女却无法抑制内心深处对那个可爱男孩所有美好记忆的涌现。他那曾令她烦恼的怯懦态度，不知怎的已融入她对他的性格认知中，成为他男孩魅力的一部分。他为她烹饪，为她打扫，包揽家中所有事务，毫无怨言。他与她并肩对抗使徒，甚至曾救过她一命。她记得在海洋中与二号机共处的插入栓里，他的手轻轻覆盖在她的手上。

Shinji was many things to her, but not all aspects of that were welcome. He'd been her despised rival and appreciated friend, her possible love interest and hated pervert, her savior…her betrayer. The boy had come to embody so many parts of her life that Asuka didn't quite understand what the Third Child meant to her, didn't know whether she hated or loved him. As the seconds ticked by, she couldn't help but picture him alone in the darkness of his room. Clenching her fists so hard the nails began to pierce the skin, Asuka sat up and sat for a moment in silence. "Shit."  
真嗣对她而言意味着许多，但并非所有方面都令她欣然接受。他曾是她憎恶的对手，也是她欣赏的朋友；可能是她心仪的对象，亦是她厌恶的变态；是她的救星……也是她的背叛者。这个男孩已融入她生活的诸多部分，使得明日香难以理解第三适格者对她究竟意味着什么，不知自己是爱是恨。随着时间流逝，她情不自禁地想象他在黑暗的房间中孤独的身影。紧握双拳至指甲刺破皮肤，明日香坐起身，在沉默中静坐片刻，低声咒骂：“该死。”

Finally finding the inclination to move, Shinji slid off his bed. His clothes were soaked from the fall outside Asuka's room. Stripping the damp t-shirt and trousers off, he tossed them in the corner of the room before pulling on a new set of pajama pants. Shinji lamented his roommate's stern refusal to stay next to him. He found himself taking more and more comfort in her presence, though he couldn't say why. A darker portion of his mind mourned the redhead's decision in a different way, conjuring images of a half stripped Asuka lying on his bed. Tugging a t-shirt down around his ears, Shinji harshly shook his head to rid himself of the images.  
终于有了行动的念头，真嗣从床上滑了下来。他的衣服因为之前倒在明日香房间外而湿透了。他脱下湿漉漉的 T 恤和裤子，扔到房间角落，然后换上了一套新的睡裤。真嗣为室友坚决拒绝留在他身边而感到遗憾。他发现自己越来越依赖她的存在，尽管他说不出原因。他内心深处的一部分以另一种方式哀悼着红发女孩的决定，脑海中浮现出半裸的明日香躺在他的床上的画面。真嗣拉下 T 恤，用力摇头，试图驱散这些画面。

Finally dressing himself, the boy settled down into bed once more. Maybe he was selfish for asking Asuka to lie near him. She never was one for physical intimacy…Kaji was the only exception. A sudden, irrational hatred for the older man burned in Shinji's chest. Of course the sentiment was completely unfair and the boy knew it, he couldn't suppress the resentment he harbored for the scruffy gentleman. The Third Child wondered if Kaji would return. For all of his jealous anger, Shinji had liked Kaji a great deal. NERV Commander Gendo Ikari had never really been Shinji's father in any way that mattered, showing his face only when it benefited himself. Kaji had tried to steer Shinji towards a proper path and show him how to be a good man. The deceptively serious man's ideals had gotten him killed.  
终于穿戴整齐，男孩再次躺回床上。或许他请求明日香躺在身边是自私的。她向来不喜身体上的亲密……只有加持是个例外。一股突如其来的、毫无道理的憎恨在真嗣胸中燃烧。当然，这种情绪完全不公平，男孩自己也明白，但他无法抑制对那位不修边幅的先生的怨恨。第三适格者思索着加持是否会回来。尽管满心嫉妒与愤怒，真嗣其实非常喜欢加持。NERV 指挥官碇源堂从未真正以父亲的身份关心过真嗣，只在对自己有利时才会露面。加持曾试图引导真嗣走上正途，教他如何成为一个好人。这位看似严肃的男人的理想最终却导致了他的死亡。

_Misato cried, listening to the sincere recording on the answering machine.  
听着答录机里真挚的留言，美里泪流满面。_

_Shinji shouted at Asuka, 'I'm telling you, Kaji is dead!'  
真嗣对着明日香大喊：'我告诉你，加持已经死了！'_

'…_You're lying.'_ '……你在撒谎。'

Staring at the blank ceiling, Shinji wondered if Asuka would cry for him if he died. Exhaling a breath he didn't remember holding, Shinji rolled onto his side and let his eyes slowly close. He almost missed the sound of the door opening. Soft, steady footsteps. The rustling of sheets and shifting of mattress springs. Shinji swallow hard before rolling over to see his visitor. Of course, the boy already knew who was there, even without his earlier request. He always felt better when she was near. Strawberry locks greeted him as he turned. "If you touch me, you're going to pull back a stump, got it?"  
凝视着空白的屋顶，真嗣思索着如果自己死去，明日香是否会为他哭泣。他吐出一口不记得何时屏住的气息，侧身躺下，缓缓闭上眼睛。他差点没听到门打开的声音。轻柔而稳健的脚步声。床单的沙沙声和弹簧床的吱嘎声。真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，然后翻身看向访客。当然，男孩已经知道是谁在那里，即使没有他之前的请求。每当她靠近时，他总是感觉更好。当他转过身时，迎接他的是一头草莓色的秀发。"如果你碰我，你会后悔的，明白了吗？"

Shinji smiled and shifted closer to the redhead before rolling back over. The aching in his muscles didn't bother him quite so much anymore and his unpleasant thoughts melted away. "Asuka…thanks."  
真嗣微笑着，向红发少女挪近了一些，然后又翻回身去。肌肉的酸痛不再那么困扰他，不愉快的思绪也消散了。"明日香……谢谢你。"

Smiling in spite of herself, Asuka chose not to answer, instead shifting closer to Shinji. Their backs almost touching both pilots rested in silence.  
尽管自己也不禁微笑，明日香选择了不回答，而是向真嗣靠近了一些。两人的背部几乎相触，两位驾驶员在沉默中休息。

**Author's Note:** I think this story might be more challenging to write than I original foresaw or intended. Oh well, I'll figure something out. This was to set a little bit more of the ground work for the story. I hope I didn't make my plot development too transparent. Oh well, review and tell me what you think. Next chapter should be up soon.  
作者的话：我觉得这个故事可能比我最初预见的或打算的要难写。哦，好吧，我会想出办法的。这是为了给故事打下更多的基础。希望我没有让我的情节发展太过明显。哦，好吧，请评论并告诉我你的想法。下一章应该很快就会更新。

### Chapter 3: Sojourn 第三章：旅居
Sunlight filtered in through the half shut drapery, cicadas began their warbling chirp, a light breeze whispered through the curtains, giving the air a pleasant chill. An arm slung around her midsection gave her warmth and stability, the presence at her back put her at ease. Sighing as she woke, Asuka Langely Soryu found that life was good.  
阳光透过半掩的窗帘洒入，蝉儿开始鸣唱，微风轻拂窗帘，带来一丝宜人的凉意。一只手臂环抱在她的腰间，给予她温暖与安定，背后的存在让她感到安心。醒来时叹了口气，惣流·明日香·兰格雷发现生活是美好的。

Rationality took over and ruined the pleasant feeling.  
理性占了上风，破坏了那份愉悦的感觉。

Her muscles tensed for a moment as she contemplated throwing off Shinji's arm and charging from the room. The moment passed and the Teutonic redhead let her muscles relax as she thought of what to do. Of course, merely dashing from Shinji's side was a completely understandable reaction, but for some reason Asuka couldn't bring herself to so blatantly separate herself from the slumbering Third Child. Rather, the young redhead carefully lifted the boy's arm and delicately slid away from him. Placing his arm back down onto the mattress with utmost care, she cautiously made her way to the door.  
她肌肉紧绷了一瞬，考虑着甩开真嗣的手臂，冲出房间。但那瞬间过去了，这位日耳曼红发少女让肌肉放松下来，思考着下一步该怎么做。当然，仅仅从真嗣身边逃离是完全可理解的反应，但不知为何，明日香无法让自己如此明显地与沉睡中的第三适格者分离。相反，这位年轻的红发少女小心翼翼地抬起男孩的手臂，轻柔地从他身边滑开。她极其小心地将他的手臂放回床垫上，然后谨慎地向门口走去。

Exiting the room and quietly sliding the wooden door closed, the strawberry haired young woman noticed that the warmth that had suffused her body only moments before was now slowly dwindling. With a scowl, Asuka remembered how much she hated symbolism.  
走出房间，轻轻地关上木门，这位草莓色头发的年轻女子注意到，就在片刻前还充盈她身体的温暖正逐渐消退。明日香皱起眉头，记起了自己有多讨厌象征意义。

Turning towards her room, Asuka was stopped in her tracks as a muffled sound drifted up the hallway from behind her. Looking over her shoulder, the mortified teenager found the source of the noise to be her widely grinning guardian. Feeling the color drain from her face, the Second Child quickly spun around, facing the dark haired woman. Rapidly waving her arms in front of her, the startled girl almost hoped to ward off the still smiling matronly figure's unspoken interpretation of the scene.  
转身朝自己房间走去，明日香突然停下脚步，因为一阵低沉的声音从她身后的走廊飘了上来。回头一看，这位惊慌失措的少女发现声音的来源是她那满脸笑容的监护人。感觉脸色瞬间苍白，第二适格者迅速转过身，面对着那位黑发女性。她急忙挥动双臂，试图挡住那位仍在微笑的中年女性对这一幕的无言解读。

"I- it's not what you think!" Trying to keep her voice low, the stammering redhead harshly whispered, as if a logical explanation would be enough to derail her guardian's train of thought. Misato waved a single finger at her pretty young charge. "Tsk, tsk tsk. What a woman; leaving her paramour without as much as a whispered goodbye. I'm surprised at you Asuka. Although, not as surprised as I am with Shinji. I didn't think the little guy had it in him."  
"我- 不是你想的那样！"试图压低声音，这位结结巴巴的红发少女急促地低声说道，仿佛一个合理的解释足以打断她监护人的思绪。美里向她年轻漂亮的被监护人摇了摇一根手指。"啧，啧啧。真是位女士；连一句悄悄的告别都不留就离开了她的情人。我对你感到惊讶，明日香。不过，我对真嗣的惊讶更大。没想到那小子还有这一手。

Fuming, Asuka quickly closed the gap standing between herself and Misato. "Look, it isn't anything like you're thinking. That's just the dirty mind of an old, gin-soaked woman working too hard." Taking the insult in stride, Misato continued with her teasing. "How was it Asuka? Was Shinji gentle? I always figured him to be the kind of guy that would do anything to please a woman. Did you tie him up?"  
气愤的明日香迅速缩短了自己与美里之间的距离。“听着，根本不是你想的那样。那只是你这个老酒鬼女人想多了。”美里不以为意，继续调侃道：“怎么样，明日香？真嗣温柔吗？我一直觉得他是那种会尽力取悦女人的类型。你把他绑起来了吗？”

The seething teenager shook in abstract rage, but found she could not come up with anything coherent to scream at the older woman. Instead, she settled on turning away and stomping towards her room.  
愤怒的少女气得浑身发抖，却发现自己想不出什么连贯的话来对这位年长女性大吼。于是，她选择转身，跺着脚朝自己的房间走去。

A bright smile still painted across her features, Misato calmly went to the kitchen and sat at the table. If she knew Asuka, the brash girl would do one of two things. The fiery young woman would either lock herself in her room to brood, or would soon arrive in the kitchen ready to argue to great lengths.  
脸上依旧挂着灿烂的笑容，美里平静地走进厨房，坐在桌旁。如果她了解明日香，这个泼辣的女孩要么会把自己锁在房间里生闷气，要么很快就会来到厨房，准备大吵一架。

The latter proved to be true as, after a short wait, Misato was pleased to see the redhead storm into the kitchen, a scowl marring her good looks. Naturally, Misato knew there was a near zero probability that Asuka and Shinji had actually done anything illicit, and in fact, the giddy woman knew joking about the situation was exactly the sort of thing she shouldn't be doing. However, she found she simply couldn't resist teasing the children in her care.  
事实证明后者是正确的，因为经过短暂的等待，美里高兴地看到红发少女怒气冲冲地闯进厨房，眉头紧锁破坏了她的美貌。自然，美里知道明日香和真嗣实际上几乎不可能做出什么不正当的事情，而且实际上，这位兴高采烈的女人知道拿这种情况开玩笑正是她不应该做的事情。然而，她发现自己就是忍不住想要逗弄她照顾的孩子们。

With no intention of stopping, Misato made a note to take the children out sometime soon. Hopefully that would work as an indirect apology. 'In the meantime,' the decommissioned major thought to herself, 'I'm going to have as much fun as can be gained from this.'  
美里并没有打算就此罢休，她记着要找个时间带孩子们出去。希望这能作为一种间接的道歉。'与此同时，'这位退役少校暗自思忖，'我要尽可能从这件事中获得乐趣。'

---

Waking in the morning, Shinji immediately knew Asuka was gone. When she'd left, he couldn't say, but without even opening his eyes he could tell she'd already made her exit. The boy's familiar companions, dejection and guilt, blossomed in his chest like poisonous flowers.  
清晨醒来，真嗣立刻知道明日香已经离开了。她何时离开的，他说不上来，但即使不睁开眼睛，他也能感觉到她已经离开了。男孩熟悉的伙伴，沮丧和内疚，在他的胸中如毒花般绽放。

The habitually depressed boy was upset that Asuka had left him, but more so than saddened, he felt profoundly guilt ridden for asking her to stay near him in the first place. He'd told himself he wouldn't be a burden to her anymore, he'd promised himself that after what he'd done to her he would find someway to atone for his sins.  
那个习惯性忧郁的男孩因为明日香离开而感到难过，但与其说是悲伤，不如说他深感内疚，因为最初是他请求她留在自己身边的。他曾告诉自己不会再成为她的负担，他承诺过，在对她做了那些事后，他会找到某种方式来赎罪。

However, for all his promises, all his resolve, in a moment of weakness he'd asked the girl to forget her own apprehension and indulge him. Shinji fought down the overwhelming urge to slam his head into the wall.  
然而，尽管他许下了所有承诺，下定了所有决心，但在一时的软弱中，他还是请求女孩放下自己的顾虑，迁就他。真嗣强压下想要猛撞墙壁的冲动。

Finding his way to the kitchen, Shinji was surprised to see Misato was not only up and about, but was also poking fun at an already dressed, very irritated looking Asuka. Noticing the table was covered in the instant meals Misato generously referred to as food, Shinji quickly decided he wasn't hungry. Sitting a distance away from the quarreling women, the former pilot grimaced as he lowered himself into a chair. Less than thrilled to discover the soreness in his stomach and back were still presenting a problem, the boy rubbed at the pained areas and let out a tired sigh.  
真嗣摸索着来到厨房，惊讶地发现不仅美里已经起床活动，还在取笑一个已经穿戴整齐、看起来非常恼火的明日香。注意到桌上摆满了美里慷慨称之为食物的速食，真嗣立刻决定自己并不饿。他远远地坐在争吵的女士们旁边，前驾驶员皱着眉头坐进椅子。发现腹部和背部的疼痛依然是个问题，男孩揉着疼痛的部位，疲惫地叹了口气。

"What's the matter Shinji, rough night?" For some reason, Misato was all smiles today. And why was Asuka so angry?  
"怎么了，真嗣，昨晚没睡好吗？" 不知为何，今天的美里笑容满面。而明日香为什么这么生气呢？

The Third Child's eyes widened as he quickly picked up on what his disturbingly attractive mother figure was implying. How she'd found out about the night's sleeping arrangement was a moot point. Instead, the boy racked his brain trying to find something to say in response to the egregious charges that lay leveled against him.  
第三适格者的眼睛瞪大了，他迅速意识到这位令人不安的迷人养母所暗示的事情。她如何得知昨晚的睡床安排已无关紧要。相反，男孩绞尽脑汁试图找到回应这些严重指控的话。

Blushing furiously, he tried to stammer out some sort of an excuse, denial, or apology. Anything would have done at the moment, but Shinji quickly discovered all he could manage were strained noises that weren't quite words. Asuka bristled with new rage at the boy's ineptitude, staring daggers at the extremely flustered and embarrassed Third Child.  
他满脸通红，试图结结巴巴地找些借口、否认或道歉。此刻任何话都行，但真嗣很快发现，他只能发出一些不成词句的紧张声音。明日香因男孩的无能而怒气更盛，用锐利的目光盯着极度慌张和尴尬的第三适格者。

Looking down at the table, Shinji tried his best to not be angry with his guardian, but found it a difficult battle. It was simply in Misato's nature to make jokes to deal with problems or uncomfortable situations. However, the circumstances with Asuka were delicate enough without the older woman's teasing exacerbating the situation. "That's not funny Misato." The statement came harsher than he'd intended. The response from the usually timid boy caught everyone at the table off guard.  
低头看着桌子，真嗣尽力不让自己对监护人生气，但发现这是一场艰难的战斗。用笑话来应对问题或尴尬局面，本就是美里天性使然。然而，与明日香的情况已经足够微妙，这位年长女性的揶揄只会让情况雪上加霜。“这一点都不好笑，美里。”这句话比他预想的要严厉。这个平日里害羞的男孩的回应让桌上的每个人都措手不及。

Tired, irritated, and sore, the boy exuded an air of palpable discomfort. Misato cast a quick glance at Asuka before shooting a sly grin at Shinji. "What's the matter Shinji? Don't tell me you're on your period too?"  
疲惫、烦躁、酸痛，男孩散发出一种明显的难受气息。美里迅速瞥了一眼明日香，然后对真嗣投去一个狡黠的笑容。“怎么了，真嗣？别告诉我你也来例假了？”

Glaring at the older woman, Shinji decided not to dignify the joke with a response, instead mumbling under his breath something about his guardian being late for work.  
瞪着那位年长女性，真嗣决定不屑于回应这个玩笑，而是低声嘟囔着关于他的监护人上班迟到的事情。

Beaming at the great success of her quips, Misato quickly bid her charges good morning and scurried off to gainful employment. Before closing the door, she winked at the two teenagers. "Asuka, don't do anything you'll regret; use protection. And Shinji, always specify a safe word."  
得意地看着自己的俏皮话大获成功，葛城美里迅速向她的两个孩子道了早安，然后匆匆赶去上班。在关门之前，她向两个青少年眨了眨眼。“明日香，别做会让你后悔的事；记得采取保护措施。还有真嗣，一定要指定一个安全词。”

Shinji found it very lucky that the departing woman managed to exit fast enough such that Asuka's thrown glass only managed to shatter against the hastily shut door. "God, don't you hate her sometimes?" Crossing her arms, Asuka gruffly sank back into her chair. Shinji didn't answer.  
真嗣觉得那位女士能迅速离开真是太幸运了，这样明日香扔出的玻璃杯只是砸在了匆忙关闭的门上，碎了一地。“天啊，你有时候不讨厌她吗？”明日香交叉双臂，粗鲁地坐回椅子上。真嗣没有回答。

Despite Misato's penchant for teasing, rather slovenly housekeeping and manners, and distinctly tasteless brand of humor, Shinji was more than willing to forgive any of her flaws. The woman had been the first to show him what it meant to have anything resembling a family. She'd given him direction, even when he'd done his best to avoid responsibility. She was more than a guardian. More than a friend. The relationship between the boy and woman was…complicated.  
尽管葛城美里喜欢开玩笑，家务和礼仪有些邋遢，幽默感也颇为低俗，但真嗣非常愿意原谅她的任何缺点。这位女士是第一个让他明白拥有类似家庭意味着什么的人。她给了他方向，即使他尽力逃避责任。她不仅仅是一个监护人。不仅仅是朋友。男孩和女人之间的关系……很复杂。

"Hey Stupid, enough with the daydreaming. Shouldn't you be cleaning up?" Breaking from his thoughts, Shinji realized Asuka was talking to him.  
"嘿，笨蛋，别再做白日梦了。你不是应该在打扫吗？" 被打断思绪的碇真嗣意识到明日香正在对他说话。

"Right, sorry." "好的，对不起。"

As he went about clearing the table of mostly disposable styrofoam containers, Shinji gave a quick glance towards the calendar. The boy both rejoiced and cursed that it was Sunday. Having the day off gave him time to get over his ailment and perhaps even catch up on his school work. It also meant having to spend time around Asuka. Normally, he wouldn't have been bothered at the prospect in the least. In point of fact, he would have been ecstatic. However, between the girl's less than cheery demeanor and the guilt over the previous night's events still fresh in his mind, Shinji found the idea of being around the redhead terrifying.  
当他开始清理桌子上大部分的一次性泡沫塑料容器时，真嗣快速地瞥了一眼日历。这个男孩既庆幸又诅咒今天是星期天。放假让他有时间克服自己的不适，也许还能赶上学校的功课。这也意味着要和明日香共度时光。通常情况下，他对此根本不会感到困扰。事实上，他会非常兴奋。然而，由于女孩不那么愉快的心情以及对前一晚事件的愧疚感仍然记忆犹新，真嗣发现和这位红发女孩在一起的想法令人恐惧。

The thought didn't sit well with him. How long had it been since he'd met the beautiful young woman? How long had they lived together? How many times did they stand together to face overwhelming odds and terrible danger? After all of that time, all of those memories, nothing was different. She was still the moody, brash girl she'd always been and he was still a coward, awed and petrified by the forceful woman. He hated her, loved her, and was afraid of her all at once.  
这个想法让他感到不安。自从他遇到那位美丽的年轻女子已经过去多久了？他们一起生活了多久？他们一起面对过多少次压倒性的困难和可怕的危险？经历了那么长时间，那么多回忆，一切都没有改变。她依旧是那个喜怒无常、鲁莽的女孩，而他依旧是一个懦夫，对这位强势的女性既敬畏又恐惧。他既恨她，又爱她，同时又害怕她。

How much of that was his fault? Hadn't Instrumentality done anything for him? Was he still the same person he'd been for so long? He wanted to say that he'd changed for the better. He wanted to lie to himself and assert that the deaths of others hadn't been for nothing, but found he couldn't.  
这其中有多少是他的错？难道‘工具性’对他没有任何帮助吗？他还是那个长久以来一成不变的人吗？他想要告诉自己他已经变得更好了。他想要欺骗自己，坚称他人的死亡并非毫无意义，但他发现自己做不到。

In spite of his longing to be different, Shinji knew that he was still the boy he always had been. He was still a weak. He was still a coward.  
尽管渴望变得不同，真嗣知道他依旧是那个一直以来的自己。他依旧软弱。他依旧是个懦夫。

It took him a moment to realize that he was alone again. Asuka made no attempt to draw attention to her exit and quietly slipped away while he was cleaning. The silence weighed heavily on the former pilot. There was no one and nothing there to prove him wrong, only himself and the simple, honest truth of his constant failures.  
他花了一会儿才意识到自己又是一个人了。明日香没有试图引起注意，而是在他打扫的时候悄悄溜走了。沉默沉重地压在这位前驾驶员身上。没有人也没有任何东西能证明他是错的，只有他自己和那些持续不断的失败所带来的简单而真实的真相。

Returning to the kitchen, Asuka noticed that Shinji had stopped cleaning up. Instead, he was staring into the sink. "Something wrong?" Tying up her hair, the girl didn't give the question much thought. It was just a simple query, something to eat up time and dispel the silence. Shinji didn't know how to respond.  
回到厨房，明日香注意到真嗣已经停止了清理。相反，他正盯着水槽发呆。“有什么问题吗？”她一边扎起头发，一边并没有多想这个问题。这只是个简单的询问，用来消磨时间和打破沉默。真嗣不知道该如何回应。

Waiting for a reply that didn't come, Asuka was getting annoyed. "Hey, I'm talking to-"  
等待着没有到来的回答，明日香开始感到恼火。“喂，我在跟你说话——”

Shinji cut her off. "I'm fine. Everything's fine." It was best to simply push the thoughts aside and make it through the day. He still had work to do.  
真嗣打断了她。"我没事。一切都好。"最好就是把这些念头抛到一边，熬过这一天。他还有工作要做。

Asuka watched as Shinji continued silently working. Something was definitely on his mind, that much was certain. Could it be about last night? He did still look kind of pale. A flash of anger washed over the teenager as she watched the boy go about his chores. What was that loser complaining about? She wasn't exactly feeling her best either, but she didn't go about moping like a goof. He just needed something to occupy his thoughts.  
明日香看着真嗣继续默默地工作。他心里肯定有什么事，这是毫无疑问的。会不会是关于昨晚的事？他看起来还是有点苍白。当她看着这个男孩做家务时，一股怒气涌上心头。那个失败者又在抱怨什么？她自己也不是感觉最好，但她没有像傻瓜一样闷闷不乐。他只是需要找点事情来分散注意力。

"Hey, Shinji, want to go for a walk?"  
"嘿，真嗣，想去散散步吗？"

Finishing the last of the clean up, Shinji glanced at his roommate, not quite sure what to make of her question. "Why? I mean I have to clean up here and I still need to study. We've got a test tomorrow, you know."  
收拾完最后一点杂物，真嗣瞥了一眼室友，不太确定该如何回答她的问题。“为什么？我是说，我得打扫这里，还得复习。明天有考试，你知道的。”

She rolled her eyes at the diligent child. "How boring. Why do you always do your very best to completely take the fun out of any given situation?" Placing her hands on her hips, Asuka's body language made it very clear she wouldn't accept an answer that wasn't to her liking. "Anyway, it's good to take a break sometimes. If you don't do something to relax, you'll get too high strung and end up doing poorly anyway."  
她对这位勤奋的孩子翻了个白眼。“真无聊。为什么你总是竭尽全力把任何情况下的乐趣都剥夺掉？”她双手叉腰，明日香的肢体语言表明，她不会接受任何不合心意的回答。“不管怎样，有时候休息一下是好的。如果你不做点什么来放松，你会过于紧张，最终表现也会很差。”

Walking with Asuka? At one time he would have done so without hesitation, but now he wasn't sure how comfortable he felt around the girl. He opened his mouth to decline. He didn't want to be around anyone else for the time being. He needed to think.  
和明日香一起散步？曾经他会毫不犹豫地答应，但现在他不确定自己是否还愿意接近这位女孩。他张开嘴想要拒绝。他暂时不想和任何人在一起。他需要思考。

"Eh…sure. J- just let me get dressed."  
"呃…当然。就…就让我穿好衣服。

Fuck. Leaving the last of the dishes in the sink, Shinji went to bathe and change. For better or worse, he never could deny Asuka anything.  
该死。把最后几个盘子留在水槽里，真嗣去洗澡换衣服了。不管怎样，他从来都无法拒绝明日香任何事。

Another day of boring paperwork, filed complaints, and setback after setback. This was getting to be more trouble that it was worth. Misato Katsuragi scribbled furiously at the reports filling her desk. Since the disbanding of NERV, she wasn't supposed to be relegated to menial jobs like this. "Fate," Misato muttered to herself, "seems to really hate me."  
又是无聊的文书工作、堆积的投诉和接二连三的挫折。这越来越麻烦，不值得。葛城美里疯狂地在堆满桌子的报告上涂写。自从 NERV 解散后，她本不该被降级做这种琐碎的工作。"命运，"美里自言自语道，"似乎真的很讨厌我。

Working in the Tokyo-2 division of the JSDF did have its advantages, Misato had to admit. With NERV swept away in Third Impact, more than a few governments decided it best to safeguard against possible Angel attacks in the future. Katsuragi wasn't too certain there ever would be another attack, but didn't discount the possibility.  
在 JSDF 的东京-2 分部工作确实有其优势，碇真嗣不得不承认。随着 NERV 在第三次冲击中被摧毁，不少政府决定最好为未来可能的天使袭击做好防范。葛城美里并不太确定是否还会有另一次袭击，但也没有排除这种可能性。

More to the point, because of her previous experience as NERV's Operations Director, the decommissioned major was looking at papers that assigned her to be Commander of a new branch of the defense force, dubbed HERZ. Misato found it far too similar to the old organization than was comfortable, but decided not to bring up such petty grievances. After all, with her at the helm, things would be different.  
更重要的是，由于她之前担任 NERV 作战部长的经验，这位退役少校正在审阅一份文件，任命她为国防军新分支 HERZ 的指挥官。美里觉得这与旧组织太过相似，令人不安，但决定不提出这些琐碎的抱怨。毕竟，由她掌舵，情况会有所不同。

Sliding on his shoes, Shinji sighed in resignation. He'd much prefer to stay inside and work, but Asuka was adamant in her position. So, because he was the pushover he always had been, Shinji agreed to walk with her.  
穿上鞋子，真嗣叹了口气，表示无奈。他更愿意留在室内工作，但明日香态度坚决。因此，由于他一如既往地容易妥协，真嗣同意和她一起去散步。

Where they were walking to, the redhead hadn't specified. Shinji wondered if she knew exactly where she was heading to at all.  
红发少女并未明确指出他们要前往何处，真嗣不禁怀疑她是否真的清楚自己的目的地。

Pushed out the door, Shinji stumbled before managing to catch his balance once more. Asuka quickly took up a quick gait, forcing the boy to hurry to keep up. The beginning of their time together didn't seem to be any indicator that things would be getting any better.  
被推出门外，真嗣踉跄了一下才重新稳住身形。明日香迅速加快步伐，迫使男孩不得不急忙跟上。他们相处的开端似乎并没有预示着情况会有所好转。

The day was perfect. The sky a striking blue with nary a cloud to tarnish its purity. It was cool without being cold enough to be uncomfortable, and the sun hung brightly in the sky. Normally, Shinji enjoyed such days but found himself unable to admire anything about the pleasant afternoon. The sky looked to be growing hazy, the air was getting more of a bite to it, and the sun seemed obnoxiously bright. It was only with the girl walking next to him that he couldn't find fault. And it wasn't for lack of trying.  
那天天气完美无瑕，天空呈现出一片纯净的蔚蓝，不见一丝云彩玷污其纯净。气温凉爽而不至于寒冷，阳光明媚地挂在空中。通常，真嗣会喜欢这样的日子，但此刻他却无法欣赏这宜人的午后。天空似乎变得朦胧，空气中的寒意愈发明显，阳光也显得异常刺眼。唯独身边这位女孩，他找不出任何瑕疵，尽管他已尽力尝试。

Everything about the attractive redhead screamed poise, grace, and beauty. As long as she wasn't speaking. Her flawless delicate skin, her crystal blue eyes, the strawberry hair that framed her pretty, heart shaped face. She was every inch the superior woman she claimed to be. Shinji sometimes found himself wondering why she didn't carry scars from Third Impact. The thought was always closely followed by intense guilt at remembering the sounds of the battle without being able to do anything to save her.  
那位迷人的红发女子，一举一动都透露着优雅与美丽，只要她不开口。她那无瑕的细腻肌肤，晶莹的蓝眼睛，以及如草莓般的发丝勾勒出她那漂亮的心形脸庞。她确实如她所宣称的那样，是个出类拔萃的女性。真嗣有时会好奇，为何她没有在第三次冲击中留下伤痕。每当这个念头闪过，紧随其后的便是深深的愧疚，因为他无法忘记那场战斗中的声音，却无力拯救她。

Asuka turned her head towards the boy at her side. His eyes snapping forward, Shinji did his best to appear very interested in the ground ahead of him. Asuka wasn't sure whether to find the whole affair cute or disgustingly childish. Instead, she decided to not say anything and make a decision later. In truth, she found she didn't quite mind Shinji's glances. After all, it wasn't as if Shinji was just anyone. 'Wait, what the hell does it matter if it's that moron or not?'  
明日香转头看向身边的男孩。他的目光迅速前移，真嗣尽力表现出对前方地面极为感兴趣的样子。明日香不确定是该觉得这一切可爱还是幼稚得令人厌恶。最终，她决定暂不表态，稍后再做决定。实际上，她发现自己并不介意真嗣的目光。毕竟，真嗣并不是随便什么人。'等等，如果是那个笨蛋又有什么关系呢？'

Glancing at the boy again, Asuka came to the decision that she didn't want to think any further on the matter.  
再次瞥了一眼那个男孩，明日香决定不再深究这个问题。

The time passed slowly, neither saying much, except for the occasional half-hearted attempt at conversation of no particular consequence, if only to have something filling the gap between them. Boarding several trains and busses, the two let the time pass trying not to focus on the awkward background noise of the discussions between pedestrians and passengers as the arena of their journey changed.  
时间缓缓流逝，两人并未多言，只是偶尔半心半意地尝试着无关紧要的对话，只为填补彼此间的空白。他们乘坐了几趟火车和巴士，任由时间流逝，尽量不去注意行人乘客间讨论的尴尬背景噪音，随着旅程场景的变换。

Shinji remembered his own travels through the streets and back alleys of Tokyo-3. Thinking back on his retreat from Eva and NERV, Shinji realized that the memory was from a scant 13 months prior. It seemed like a lifetime ago. A new pang of nausea struck as the Third Child peered out the window of the bus. Covering his mouth until it passed, Shinji cursed his decision to come with Asuka.  
真嗣回忆起自己穿梭于第三新东京市街头巷尾的旅程。回想起从 EVA 和 NERV 撤退的那段经历，真嗣意识到那不过是 13 个月前的事。却仿佛已是隔世。当第三适格者从巴士窗户向外望去时，一阵新的恶心感袭来。他捂住嘴直到这感觉过去，真嗣诅咒着自己跟随明日香的决定。

Rubbing her stomach the Second Child silently cursed her anatomy once more. The discomfort slowly passed as she leaned back in her seat. Shinji had it easy, even if he didn't know it. At least men didn't have a monthly cycle of agony for the sole crime of not having a child. "Hey Shinji, where do you want to get off at?" Not getting an immediate response Asuka turned to her traveling companion. "Hey, Stupid, are you listening to me? Eh...what's the matter?"  
轻抚着腹部，第二适格者再次默默咒骂自己的生理构造。随着她靠回座位，不适感逐渐消退。真嗣真是轻松，尽管他自己可能并不知道。至少男性不会因为未育而每月遭受一次痛苦的生理周期。“嘿，真嗣，你想在哪儿下车？”没有立即得到回应，明日香转向她的旅伴。“喂，笨蛋，你在听我说话吗？呃...怎么了？”

The boy looked slightly paler than usual, hand plastered over his mouth. He was going to be sick. "Oh great, why didn't you tell me you get motion sick you idiot?" Shaking her head with a sigh, Asuka shrugged helplessly. "At least that answers the question of where we're getting off at."  
男孩看起来比平时更苍白，手捂着嘴。他快要吐了。“哦，天哪，你为什么不告诉我你晕车，你这个白痴？”明日香叹了口气，无奈地摇了摇头。“至少这回答了我们将在哪里下车的问题。”

Stepping off the bus, the two teenagers found themselves clear across the city from their home. Hunched over, Shinji tried to curb the nausea and cramping in his stomach. Asuka tapped her foot impatiently. The Third Child couldn't understand what the redhead was so anxious about, there was nothing out here.  
下了公交车，两个少年发现自己离家远在城市的另一头。真嗣弯着腰，试图抑制住胃里的恶心和腹痛。明日香不耐烦地跺着脚。第三适格者不明白红发女孩为何如此焦急，这里什么也没有。

Taking in his surroundings Shinji could see a highway in the distance. That was the road which connected Tokyo-2 to the scarred and ruined remains of what used to be Tokyo-3. Looking away, the boy also noticed that the surrounding area wasn't overgrown, for some reason it looked like people _did_ come out here.  
环顾四周，真嗣可以看到远处的高速公路。那是连接东京-2 与曾经是东京-3 的伤痕累累、满目疮痍的遗迹的道路。他转过头，还注意到周围地区并没有杂草丛生，不知为何，这里看起来似乎有人来过。

Asuka tapped Shinji on the shoulder. "Hey, what's out here that people would come visit? There's nothing around." Apparently, Asuka had noticed the peculiarity as well. Straightening up, the Third Child looked for any sort of land mark, but found nothing. The only remarkable thing about the green field was the hill that dominated the area.  
明日香轻拍了下真嗣的肩膀，问道：“嘿，这里有什么值得人们来访的？周围什么都没有。”显然，明日香也注意到了这一异常。真嗣挺直身子，寻找任何地标，却一无所获。这片绿色田野中唯一引人注目的，就是那座占据主导地位的小山丘。

Tugging on Shinji's arm, Asuka pointed up to the hilltop. "Let's head up there, that's the only thing worth looking into. Maybe there's a nice view of the city." Shinji doubted anyone would travel to the outskirts of the city for the view, but then again Shinji had never been on a date before. The thought struck a chord as the boy wondered as to the exact nature of the outing he and Asuka were on. He quickly lost track of the thought as Asuka roughly pulled him towards the hill.  
明日香拉着真嗣的手臂，指向山顶说：“我们去那儿看看，那里是唯一值得探究的地方。也许能从那里看到城市的美景。”真嗣怀疑会有人为了看风景而特意来到市郊，但转念一想，自己以前从未有过约会经历。这个念头触动了他，让他开始思考自己和明日香这次出行的确切性质。然而，随着明日香粗鲁地拉着他向山丘走去，他很快便忘记了这些思绪。

Her curiosity piqued, the girl wanted to know exactly why anyone would come to such a boring place. Maybe the two teenagers had come across some good luck with Shinji's sudden need to stop. The steep hill made the journey to the top difficult. It would have helped had there been a clear path to follow. Instead, the former pilots had to make due with a crudely worn trail that others before them seemed to use.  
她的好奇心被勾起，女孩想知道究竟为什么有人会来到这样一个无聊的地方。或许这两个少年因真嗣突然的停车而交了好运。陡峭的山坡使得攀登至顶变得艰难。如果有一条清晰的路径可循，情况或许会好些。然而，两位前驾驶员只能勉强沿着一条似乎是前人踩出的粗糙小径前行。

Cresting the hill, the pilots found themselves staring at a large wooden cross. Crudely carved in the dark wood were the characters "3I- For Those Lost and Those Left Behind." Neither child could find anything worth saying.  
登上山顶，两位驾驶员眼前出现了一个巨大的木制十字架。在深色木头上粗糙地刻着“3I- 献给逝去与留下的人”。两个孩子都找不到任何值得说出口的话。

**Author's Note:** I know, it was a given that the two would wind up close after falling asleep. Ah, well who am I to break the laws of fiction physics and probability? Although, I must admit, this is turning into a ridiculously difficult story to write. No matter. I'll keep moving forward. Next chapter will contain more plot details, I hope for the actual story to start to unfold next time.  
作者的话：我知道，两人在睡梦中靠近是必然的。唉，我怎能打破小说物理学和概率的定律呢？尽管如此，我必须承认，这个故事写起来异常困难。没关系，我会继续前进。下一章将包含更多情节细节，希望下一次能让真正的故事开始展开。

### Chapter 4: Purgatory 
炼狱
**2nd Disclaimer**- It has been brought to my attention that my own ideas have coincided with a preexisting fan fic, in regards to the organization HERZ. I wish to state that I was unaware of this and that this overlap of ideas is purely coincidental.  
第二条声明——我注意到我的某些想法与一部已存在的同人小说中的组织 HERZ 不谋而合。我在此声明，我之前并不知晓该作品，这种想法上的重叠纯属巧合。

---

The sun had already crept down below the horizon and the apartment was still more than halfway across the city. Shinji Ikari kept pace with his red haired companion as the two made their way back from the edge of the metropolis. Neither had said anything since finding the crudely fashioned memorial.  
太阳已悄然沉没在地平线之下，而公寓还远在城市另一端。碇真嗣与他的红发同伴并肩而行，两人正从大都会的边缘返回。自从发现那个简陋的纪念碑后，他们之间便再无言语。

Shinji had more questions for Asuka than he wanted to really contemplate, but decided it was best not to probe too deeply into the matter. She'd been through a lot during the ordeals of Third Impact and Instrumentality.  
真嗣对明日香有太多的疑问，但他决定最好不要深究。她在第三次冲击和人类补完计划中经历了太多磨难。

The Third Child wanted to believe that Asuka was back to her old self. He wanted to believe that Asuka had once again become the confident, unshakable spirit she'd been when he'd first met her, but…  
第三适格者希望相信明日香已经恢复了往日的模样。他渴望相信明日香再次成为了他初见时那个自信、坚不可摧的灵魂，但是……

The boy couldn't shake the image of the comatose, empty shell he'd seen in the NERV hospital bed. The girl had been used and strained to the physical and emotional breaking point, leaving her nothing but a broken doll, a puppet with its strings cut. She hid herself away from the world and everyone in it. Until she came back with a vengeance. All was well, and for a brief, shining moment, Asuka returned to being the beautiful, self-assured girl she'd always been. Only to be shattered again by the Eva Series.  
那男孩无法摆脱在 NERV 医院病床上看到的那个昏迷、空洞的身影。那女孩被利用到了身心崩溃的边缘，留下的不过是一个破碎的玩偶，一个断了线的傀儡。她将自己与世界和所有人隔绝。直到她带着复仇的怒火归来。一切似乎都好起来了，在短暂而闪耀的瞬间，明日香重新变回了那个美丽、自信的女孩。然而，又被 Eva 系列再次击碎。

Looking at her, the casual observer would never guess the bright redhead was anything other than completely sure of herself, undaunted by her past experiences. Shinji tried to tell himself she was healed, but the Third Child knew all too well that not every wound was physical. And most of them didn't disappear so easily.  
看着她，旁观者绝不会猜到这位明亮的红发少女除了对自己完全有信心外，还会被过去的经历所困扰。真嗣试图说服自己她已经痊愈，但第三适格者深知，并非所有伤口都是肉体上的。而且大多数伤口并不会那么容易消失。

"Hey, Shinji." Looking at the ground ahead of her, Asuka seemed to be just as deep in thought as the boy at her side. "I've been meaning to ask you, but…I wasn't quite sure what to say." Casting her eyes towards the heavens, she stopped for a moment.  
“嘿，真嗣。”看着前方的地面，明日香似乎和身旁的男孩一样陷入了沉思。“我一直想问你，但是……我不太确定该怎么说。”她抬头望向天空，停顿了片刻。

Halting next to the distracted Second Child, Shinji nervously stared at his feet rather than the stars. He tried not to stargaze anymore. He was afraid that he'd look up and find a bright red slash carved across the night sky. The strange ring had dissolved shortly after Third Impact, but the boy couldn't help but expect to see the peculiar sight when he found his gaze drifting skyward.  
停在分心的第二适格者旁边，真嗣紧张地盯着他的脚，而不是星星。他试图不再仰望星空。他害怕一抬头就会看到夜空中划过一道鲜红的裂痕。那个奇怪的光环在第三次冲击后不久就消散了，但男孩还是忍不住期待，当他抬头望向天空时，会再次看到那奇特的景象。

Startled to find that Asuka had resumed walking, Shinji quickened his gait to once again take his place at the young woman's side. What had she wanted to ask him? The boy contemplated asking her, but found himself unsure if that was the wisest course of action. The Third Child remained silent as he kept pace with his companion.  
发现明日香又开始走路，真嗣吃了一惊，赶紧加快脚步，再次走到这位年轻女子身边。她刚才想问他什么？男孩考虑过问她，但又觉得这可能不是最明智的做法。第三适格者保持沉默，与同伴并肩而行。

The long, uneasy silence returned, broken only by the atmosphere of the thriving metropolis. The bright lights of the city flashed around the two teenagers, the air alive with conversation and passing traffic. The flashing neon signs and the bright streetlights worked to keep the darkness of the night at bay. The man-made lights inadvertently wound up creating more dancing shadows than they could cast out.  
漫长的、不安的沉默再次降临，只有繁华都市的氛围打破了这份寂静。城市的明亮灯光在两个少年周围闪烁，空气中充满了交谈声和过往车辆的喧嚣。闪烁的霓虹灯和明亮的街灯努力驱散夜晚的黑暗。这些人为的灯光无意中制造了比它们能驱散的更多的舞动阴影。

The hush between the two pilots lasted for several blocks. Stopping before a large stone fountain, the Children found themselves in the unofficial center of Tokyo-2. With a large variety of shops and cafes surrounding the landmark, it was no surprise that many young couples found the area ideal for dates.  
两位驾驶员之间的沉默持续了好几条街区。停在一个巨大的石制喷泉前，孩子们发现自己来到了东京-2 的非官方中心。四周环绕着各式商店和咖啡馆，难怪许多年轻情侣认为这里是理想的约会地点。

Both pilots stared into the cascading waters of the stone creation, neither wanting to look at the other. Most spectators would be amazed at the way the bright lights of the near by buildings reflected off the shimmering and constantly flowing waters of the fountain to create a charmingly bright display of color. Asuka found it hurt her eyes.  
两位驾驶员凝视着石制喷泉中倾泻的水流，谁也不愿看向对方。大多数旁观者会对附近建筑的明亮灯光在闪烁且不断流动的喷泉水面上反射出的迷人色彩感到惊叹。但明日香觉得这刺痛了她的眼睛。

Rubbing absently at his right eye, Shinji decided to find out what his companion had started to ask. Swallowing, the boy clenched and unclenched his hands. "Ah, Asuka-"  
真嗣无意识地揉了揉右眼，决定弄清楚他的同伴刚才想问什么。他咽了口唾沫，握紧又松开双手。“啊，明日香——”

"I wanted to ask you…" The girl interrupted, steadfastly keeping her gaze locked onto the bright colors dancing across the swirling waters. "What do you remember about being in… that place?"  
"我想问你…" 女孩打断道，目光坚定地锁定在波光粼粼的水面上跳跃的明亮色彩。"关于那个地方，你还记得些什么？"

Eye's widening, Shinji barely gained the composure to close his mouth. Shifting his feet uncomfortably, he struggled for a way to answer.  
真嗣的眼睛睁大了，好不容易才镇定下来，合上了嘴巴。他不安地挪动着脚步，努力寻找一个回答的方式。

Grasping at straws and never coming up with a satisfactory answer, the boy closed his eyes and let out a sigh. "I remember bits and pieces, but never enough to make any sense."  
男孩抓耳挠腮，始终找不到一个满意的答案，他闭上眼睛，叹了口气。"我记得一些零碎的片段，但从来不足以拼凑出任何意义。"

Licking his suddenly dry lips, the boy continued, "I- I think… the strongest memories are about Misato and Ayanami…and you. It wasn't…" Shuddering at the unpleasant flashes of memory, Shinji couldn't finish the thought. The smell of coffee drifted from one of the cafes.  
舔了舔突然干涩的嘴唇，男孩继续说道：“我……我觉得……最深刻的记忆是关于美里小姐和绫波……还有你。那不是……”因不愉快的记忆片段而颤抖，真嗣无法完成这个想法。咖啡的香味从一家咖啡馆飘了出来。

"I didn't like it." “我不喜欢那样。”

Opening his eyes and lifting his gaze, the boy finally forced himself to look at the girl at his side. Still staring forward, Asuka held her arms close to her chest. Her arms weren't crossed in her usual display of disgust or egotism.  
睁开眼睛，抬起视线，男孩终于强迫自己看向身边的女孩。依旧直视前方，明日香将双臂紧贴胸前。她的手臂并没有像往常那样交叉，表现出厌恶或自大的姿态。

It looked like she was trying to hold herself.  
看起来她正试图控制自己。

Looking away again, Shinji wondered what the redhead had seen. Shuddering in fear, he wondered just how much of the experiences he'd had were shared with her.  
再次移开视线，真嗣想知道那个红发女孩看到了什么。他因恐惧而颤抖，不禁思索自己经历的多少事与她共享。

_I know all about your little jerk-off fantasies about me.  
我对你的那些关于我的小幻想一清二楚。_

Even before he'd gone to Tokyo-3, Shinji wondered as to the nature and existence of the Almighty. After Third Impact, the boy harbored serious doubts about the presence of a benevolent god. And yet, despite his uncertainty on the subject, the Third Child silently prayed that Asuka really didn't know about his disgusting sins.  
甚至在前往第三新东京市之前，真嗣就对全能者的本质和存在感到好奇。在第三次冲击之后，这个少年对仁慈上帝的存在产生了严重的怀疑。尽管他对这个问题感到不确定，但第三适格者默默祈祷，希望明日香真的不知道他那些令人作呕的罪行。

Shinji was shaking. 'Maybe' Asuka thought to her self, 'all this talk about Instrumentality isn't something he's ready for.' The boy always had been more than a little fragile. It was almost a sure thing that Instrumentality had cracked the boy's emotional foundations a bit.  
真嗣在颤抖。'也许'，明日香心想，'谈论人类补完计划对他来说还为时过早。'这个男孩一直都比较脆弱。几乎可以肯定，人类补完计划已经动摇了他情感的根基。

Maybe it would be best to forget the whole matter and just walk the rest of the way home.  
或许最好的办法是忘记整件事，然后继续走完回家的路。

"What about you?" Flicking her eyes to her left, Asuka studied the boy as he finally gathered the nerve to look at her. His eyes couldn't decide whether they wanted to connect with hers or not, constantly drifting between them and the ground.  
"你呢？" 阿苏卡将目光投向左侧，仔细观察着那个男孩，他终于鼓起勇气看向她。他的眼神犹豫不决，时而与她的目光交汇，时而又飘向地面。

In truth, this was the whole reason she'd brought up the subject of Instrumentality. Hell, it was the whole reason she'd brought him out at all. She wanted to be able to talk to someone about the ordeal. Where to start, though? She was ready to deal with Instrumentality, but….  
实际上，这就是她提起人类补完计划话题的全部原因。天哪，这也是她带他出来的全部原因。她想要能和某人谈谈这段经历。但是，从哪里开始呢？她已经准备好面对人类补完计划，但是……

Absently running a hand across her abdomen, the girl decided that the fight with the Eva Series wasn't something she wasn't quite ready to relive.  
女孩无意识地用手抚过腹部，决定与 EVA 系列机体的战斗还不是她准备好再次回忆的事情。

Set in her course of action, Asuka gripped her arms tighter. "I saw Kaji again. Wondergirl and Misato were there too. And Mama." A defeated look swept across Shinji's face. Apparently he was upset about something she'd said.  
下定决心后，明日香更紧地抓住自己的手臂。“我又见到加持先生了。绫波和美里小姐也在。还有妈妈。”真嗣脸上掠过一丝挫败的神情。显然，他对她所说的某些话感到不快。

"Did they tell you anything?" The Third Child was simultaneously relieved and devastated at Asuka's version of Instrumentality. Apparently, he wasn't part of it.  
"“他们告诉你什么了吗？”第三适格者对明日香描述的融合状态既感到宽慰又深受打击。显然，他并未被包括在内。”

Asuka nodded, "Yeah, I think so. I'm not sure what they wanted. Everything was so… ambiguous." The ex-pilot chewed on her lip nervously. She swore she would tell Shinji about what she saw, but the redhead still couldn't bring herself to tell the Third Child how large a role he played in that place.  
"明日香点头道：“嗯，我想是的。我不确定他们想要什么。一切都是那么……模糊不清。”前驾驶员紧张地咬着嘴唇。她发誓会告诉真嗣她所见的一切，但这位红发少女仍无法鼓起勇气向第三适格者透露他在那个地方扮演的巨大角色。”

"Ambiguous." Staring into the headache-inducing lights dancing across the waters of the fountain, Shinji repeated Asuka's description of Instrumentality. "That's a good way to describe it." Rei had used the same word.  
"模棱两可。" 凝视着喷泉水面跳跃的令人头疼的灯光，真嗣重复了明日香对人类补完计划的描述。"这是个很好的形容。" 绫波也用了同样的词。

"I hated that world." Asuka was scowling now, her hands clenched tightly into fists. "You could look in any direction and see the past of anyone you wanted. Nobody could hide anything from anyone else. Everyone was forced to bare their soul to anyone who cared to look. Everyone just pooled together to lick their own wounds. It was disgusting."  
"我讨厌那个世界。" 明日香现在皱着眉头，双手紧紧握成拳头。"无论你朝哪个方向看，都能看到你想看的任何人的过去。没有人能向别人隐藏任何东西。每个人都不得不向任何愿意看的人敞开自己的灵魂。大家只是聚在一起舔舐自己的伤口。真是令人作呕。"

Shinji understood what Asuka was trying to tell him. Her words from the 15th Angel attack echoed in his memory: _No, please! Don't look into me!_  
真嗣理解明日香试图告诉他的话。她从第 15 使徒攻击时的话语在他记忆中回响：不，求你了！别看进我的内心！

The boy was surprised that the normally closed off girl would reveal so much about herself. Asuka was quick to boast of her college degree, physical aptitude, and special status as an Eva Pilot, among many other superior qualities she possessed. It was almost unthinkable for the Second Child to admit insecurity or fear so freely.  
男孩惊讶于那个通常封闭的女孩竟会如此坦露心扉。明日香很快便夸耀起她的大学学位、体能优势以及作为 Eva 驾驶员的特殊身份，以及其他众多优越品质。对于第二适格者来说，几乎难以想象她会如此坦率地承认自己的不安与恐惧。

"Asuka…thank you." “明日香……谢谢你。”

The redhead furrowed her brow. What brought this on? The abrupt change in the boy's tone caught her off guard. Unsure of how to respond, Asuka fell back on the bravado she'd comfortably used as a shield so often. "Yeah, well…what are you thanking me for you idiot?"  
红发少女皱起了眉头。这是怎么了？男孩语气的突然转变让她措手不及。不知如何回应，明日香本能地回到了她惯用的、作为盾牌的虚张声势上。“哼，好吧……你这个傻瓜，谢我什么啊？”

Shaking his head, Shinji gave a meek smile. "Nothing." He looked down at his watch. "I think we should try to hail a cab or something. Misato should be getting off work soon."  
真嗣摇了摇头，露出一丝怯懦的微笑。“没什么。”他低头看了看手表。“我觉得我们应该试着叫辆出租车什么的。美里应该快下班了。”

---

The stacks of paper neatly set across the desk were testament to her change. Misato Katsuragi had become far more organized over the course of the time leading up to Third Impact. Most people who'd known the Major before the noticeable difference found the change unsettling.  
桌子上整齐堆放的文件是她变化的证明。在第三次冲击前的这段时间里，葛城美里少校变得远比以前有条理。大多数认识她的人在注意到这一显著变化后，都觉得这种改变令人不安。

Form after form of requests, invoices, budget constraints, and other bureaucratic nonsense flooded her office. How had Commander Ikari done it? The man was devoted, but it would take a fanatic to get through this much work. Although, he did have Vice Commander Fuyutsuki to push paperwork on.  
一份接一份的申请表、发票、预算限制和其他官僚主义的琐事淹没了她的办公室。伊卡里指挥官是怎么做到的？那个人虽然很投入，但要完成这么多工作，非得是个狂热分子不可。不过，他确实有副指挥官冬月来帮忙处理文书工作。

As if on cue, the door slid open revealing a dark haired, bespectacled man in his late twenties. "Hello Maj- Uh…I guess I should call you Commander now, right?" Makoto Hyuga gave a small smile.  
仿佛是应了某个信号，门悄然滑开，露出一位黑发戴眼镜的男子，约莫二十八九岁。“你好，真嗣——呃……我想我现在应该称呼你为指挥官了，对吧？”碇真嗣露出一丝微笑。

"I wouldn't worry about it Hyuga." Stifling a yawn, Misato set down the pen in her hand and glanced at the clock. Almost nine o'clock at night. She should have left over an hour ago. "What is it this time, Vice Commander?"  
“不用太在意这个，真嗣。”美里忍住一个哈欠，放下手中的笔，瞥了一眼时钟。已是晚上九点。她本该在一个多小时前就离开的。“这次又是什么事，副指挥官？”

Hyuga stopped resting his shoulder against the door frame. Reluctantly, the newly appointed Vice Commander of HERZ moved forward to place several newly arrived documents on the dark haired woman's desk. "The U.N. wants to work on recovering certain… items from Tokyo-3."  
真嗣停止倚靠门框，不情愿地，这位新任命的 HERZ 副指挥官向前移动，将几份新到的文件放在那位黑发女子的桌上。“联合国希望着手回收东京-3 的某些……物品。”

Flipping through the papers, Misato scowled at the information. "Do those U.N. idiots really think they'll find anything?" Hyuga gave a small shrug. Leaning over her desk, the HERZ Commander propped her head against her fist. "I guess it can't be helped. Get to work on putting a team together to search for any remnants of the original Magi System. Send them first thing tomorrow."  
翻阅着文件，葛城美里皱着眉头看着这些信息。“那些联合国的人真的以为他们能找到什么吗？”日向轻轻耸了耸肩。靠在桌边，HERZ 指挥官用手撑着头。“我想这也是没办法的事。着手组建一个团队，去搜寻原版三贤人系统的任何遗迹。让他们明天一早就出发。”

Snapping a salute, Hyuga gave a short 'Yes Ma'am' and turned to leave. He was stopped by the woman's voice. "Hyuga, you can drop the formalities. We're friends, right?"  
日向啪的一声敬了个礼，简短地应了声“是，女士”，便转身要走。却被女子的声音叫住了。“日向，不用这么拘礼。我们是朋友，对吧？”

Without turning around the bespectacled young man gave a small smile. "Right, Katsuragi."  
戴着眼镜的年轻人没有回头，只是微微一笑。“对，葛城。”

---

Arriving home, Shinji shelled out what little money he had to the cab driver. To his credit, he complained very little and in a very low voice.  
到家后，真嗣将自己仅剩的一点钱付给了出租车司机。值得称赞的是，他抱怨得很少，声音也很低。

"You say something Shinji?" Asuka looked over her shoulder at the Third Child as the cab drove away. He shook his head quickly. "N- no. Nothing at all."  
“你说什么了吗，真嗣？”明日香回头看向第三适格者，此时出租车正驶离。他迅速摇头，“不，什么也没有。”

With a brief huff, the redhead turned away and quickly led the way back up the stairs to the apartment.  
红发少女轻哼一声，随即转身快步领着路，重新上楼回到公寓。

Digging in his pockets for the keys, Shinji was surprised to hear the clicking of fast approaching heels. "Hey, Shinji, Asuka. What're you guys doing out so late?" Misato quickly joined the children at the door, hovering behind Shinji. Smiling mischievously, the woman leaned down near the boy's ear. "Did you take Asuka to a love hotel?"  
在口袋里摸索钥匙时，真嗣惊讶地听到急促接近的高跟鞋声。“嘿，真嗣，明日香，你们这么晚在外面做什么？”美里迅速来到门口，站在真嗣身后。她狡黠地笑着，俯身靠近男孩的耳朵。“你带明日香去爱情旅馆了吗？”

Recoiling from Shinji at the accusation, Asuka quickly found her voice. "What was that, Misato!? Oh my God, you're so gross! Is that the only thing on your mind you dirty old hag?" Searching with newly inspired vigor, the Third Child quickly found the key to the apartment. Speedily opening the door, the boy quickly disappeared into his room.  
被真嗣的指控吓得后退，明日香很快找回了自己的声音。“你说什么，美里！天啊，你太恶心了！你脑子里就只有这些龌龊事吗，你这脏老太婆？”在新的动力驱使下，第三适格者迅速找到了公寓的钥匙。迅速打开门，男孩迅速消失在自己的房间里。

He could still hear Misato mercilessly teasing Asuka through the thin walls of the home. Sighing, Shinji hoped his guardian would let up soon, it sounded as if Asuka was going to have an apoplexy.  
他仍能透过家中薄薄的墙壁听到美里无情地取笑明日香。叹了口气，真嗣希望他的监护人能很快停止，听起来明日香快要气炸了。

Stumbling to his bed, the Third Child found he was very tired. At the moment, it felt as if every hour of his life had caught up with him. Barely taking the time to take off his clothes, the tired boy sluggishly crawled into bed. As the darkness of sleep bubbled around the edges of his thoughts, the last things Shinji heard were Asuka's shrill cries mixed with Misato's teasing giggles.  
跌跌撞撞地走到床边，第三适格者发现自己非常疲惫。此刻，他感觉自己生命中的每一小时都追了上来。几乎没来得及脱掉衣服，疲惫的少年便懒洋洋地爬上了床。当睡意的黑暗在思绪边缘泛起时，真嗣最后听到的是明日香尖锐的叫声混杂着美里戏谑的笑声。

---

The city was so dark. All around empty, lightless towers rose from the ground, a testament to Man's power. Even above those steel and glass monoliths, Shinji Ikari stood as the apex of humanity, the zenith of Man's achievements. Shinji Ikari…and Evangelion Unit-01.  
这座城市如此黑暗。四周空荡荡的，无光的塔楼拔地而起，见证了人类的伟力。即便在这些钢铁与玻璃的巨构之上，碇真嗣仍屹立为人类的顶点，人类成就的巅峰。碇真嗣……以及 EVA 初号机。

The boy's mind spread through the armored giant, making him feel as if he truly was a god walking the earth. He strode amongst the towers of humanity's greatest city, feeling the ground tremble under his stride.  
少年的意识蔓延至装甲巨人之中，让他感觉自己仿佛真的是行走在大地上的神明。他漫步在人类最伟大城市的塔楼之间，感受着脚下大地因他的步伐而颤抖。

The hand lashed out, grasping his head. He cried out in surprise and panic. He couldn't move. A pressure pressed into his arm.  
那只手猛地伸出，抓住他的头。他惊叫出声，既惊讶又恐慌。他动弹不得。一股压力压在他的手臂上。

**Snap**

Shooting pain flashed through his arm and bright spots danced in front of his eyes. It took the Third Child every drop of willpower to keep from passing out. The haze clearing, replaced by a terrible pain, the boy realized that his arm was broken.  
剧痛闪电般穿透他的手臂，眼前闪现出明亮的斑点。第三适格者用尽所有意志力才没让自己昏过去。随着迷雾散去，取而代之的是可怕的疼痛，男孩意识到自己的手臂断了。

As the phantom lights disappeared a single dot stubbornly remained, growing steadily brighter and brighter. Soon it rivaled the sun in radiance, forcing the boy to look away.  
当幻影般的光芒消失后，一个光点固执地留了下来，逐渐变得越来越亮。不久，它的亮度堪比太阳，迫使男孩不得不移开视线。

The light solidified and crashed into his eye. The impact jarred his teeth and blurred his vision. Another impact. A third. The light drew back a final time, as Shinji cried out in terror, pain, and knowledge of what came next.  
光芒凝实，猛烈撞击他的眼睛。冲击震得他牙齿打颤，视线模糊。又一次撞击。第三次。光芒最终退去，留下真嗣在恐惧、痛苦和即将到来的预感中尖叫。

The lance of the third Angel ripped through Eva's helmet and out its back, shredding organs and flesh, breaking bone. Shinji Ikari felt his eye compress and finally rupture under the attack, spilling clear liquid and spraying blood.  
第三使徒的长矛贯穿了 Eva 的头盔，从背部穿出，撕裂内脏与血肉，粉碎骨骼。碇真嗣感受到自己的眼睛在攻击下压缩，最终爆裂，清澈的液体与鲜血四溅。

Snapping up in bed, Shinji pressed his hand against his right eye to confirm it was still there. Deep panicked breaths escaped as he quickly checked his left arm. Nothing wrong there either. He fell back onto his pillow. "Another dream."  
真嗣从床上惊坐起，急忙用手按住右眼确认它还在。深陷恐慌的呼吸急促，他又迅速检查了左臂。那里也安然无恙。他颓然倒回枕头上。“又是梦。”

Rolling on his side, the boy noticed the digital clock on his desk read 5:48 in the morning. With only a few minutes before his alarm went off, the Third Child decided to force himself out of bed. Making his way towards the bathroom, the calendar hanging on the wall of his room, Shinji stopped dead. The date was circled with the hastily scrawled characters "TEST TODAY."  
翻身侧躺，少年注意到桌上的电子钟显示着清晨 5 点 48 分。离闹钟响起只剩几分钟，第三适格者决定强迫自己起床。走向浴室的路上，房间墙上挂着的日历让真嗣突然停下脚步。日期被匆忙地圈了起来，旁边潦草地写着“今日测试”。

The dark haired boy slapped a hand to his forehead. He'd forgotten all about it. He'd told Asuka about the test yesterday. They should've been studying all yesterday, not gallivanting around Tokyo-2.  
黑发少年一巴掌拍在额头上。他完全忘了这件事。昨天他还跟明日香提过这个测试。他们本应该昨天一起复习，而不是在第二新东京市四处游荡。

He taking a deep breath, Shinji admitted to himself that the trip he took with Asuka was probably worth it. It was almost like…a date. Shinji couldn't keep a smile from his face, and blushed despite himself.  
深吸一口气，真嗣向自己承认，与明日香的那次出行或许还是值得的。那几乎就像……一次约会。真嗣忍不住露出微笑，尽管自己脸颊泛红。

Stepping into the hall, he met Asuka, freshly crawled from bed as well. Her hair a mess, her eyes half screwed shut, a scowl painted across her features, Asuka really wasn't a morning person. Shinji was always shocked to find that no matter what the situation, she always looked breathtaking.  
踏入大厅，他遇到了同样刚从床上爬起来的明日香。她的头发凌乱，眼睛半闭着，脸上带着不悦的表情，明日香确实不是个早起的人。真嗣总是惊讶地发现，无论什么情况，她总是美得令人窒息。

"What's with the stupid smirk?" The boy quickly stopped smiling, thinking for a suitable response. He wasn't going to tell her the real reason, not if he knew what was good for him. After a short pause, the boy simply muttered, "Good dream."  
“你那傻笑是什么意思？”男孩迅速收起笑容，思考着合适的回答。他不会告诉她真正的原因，如果他知道什么对自己好。短暂的停顿后，男孩只是低声说：“做了个好梦。”

With a short huff, the redhead disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her. The sound of running water told Shinji he wasn't going to get a turn for a while. With a sigh, the tired boy decided to make breakfast. Popping slices of bread into the toaster and cracking a few eggs into a skillet, the boy dreaded the coming school day.  
红发女孩哼了一声，消失在浴室里，重重地关上了门。流水声告诉真嗣，他暂时还轮不到用。叹了口气，疲惫的男孩决定做早餐。将几片面包放入烤面包机，把几个鸡蛋打入煎锅，男孩对即将到来的学校日子感到忧心忡忡。

---

Walking home, Shinji stared slack jawed and wide eyed at his test. He had no explanation for it. Without studying more than 2 hours in the past week, he'd managed to ace an advanced physics test. "Really, I don't see why you're so surprised. I mean, it isn't like the test was all that difficult. I got 100 too."  
走在回家的路上，真嗣目瞪口呆地盯着他的试卷。他对此毫无解释。在过去的一周里，他只学习了不到两个小时，却成功地通过了高级物理考试。'真的，我不明白你为什么这么惊讶。我的意思是，这考试并没有那么难。我也得了 100 分。'

Asuka always did have to chime in. "Yeah, well I'm not college educated. And don't you think it's weird that you aced that test too? I thought you couldn't really read kanji." The redhead thought for a moment, but quickly dismissed the observation. "Simple really," She bragged "I'm just so incredibly bright that I managed to pick up the writing style in my short time living here. Don't seem so shocked, I _am_ a genius after all. And, maybe you just got lucky. That seems about as good an explanation as any."  
明日香总是喜欢插话。'是啊，我又没上过大学。你不觉得你也通过了那个考试很奇怪吗？我以为你根本不会读汉字。'红发女孩想了一会儿，但很快否定了这个观察。'其实很简单，'她自夸道，'我只是太聪明了，在这么短的时间内就掌握了这里的书写风格。别那么惊讶，我毕竟是天才。而且，也许你只是运气好。这似乎是个不错的解释。'

The Third Child shrugged. He wasn't so sure about that. It was impossible to do so well on that test by sheer luck. What troubled the boy most was the fact that, for some reason, he knew how to solve even the most complicated questions on the exam.  
第三适格者耸了耸肩。他对此并不确定。仅凭运气在那个考试中取得如此好的成绩是不可能的。最让这个男孩困扰的是，不知为何，他知道如何解答考试中最复杂的问题。

Physics was never his most celebrated subject. He did a fairly decent job at keeping up with other students, but he'd never particularly understood the subject, truth be told. In the end, he decided to simply enjoy the walk with Asuka and the minor scholastic success.  
物理从来不是他最擅长的科目。他勉强能跟上其他同学，但说实话，他从未真正理解过这门学科。最终，他决定简单地享受与明日香一起散步的时光，以及这小小的学业成就。

Despite her cool exterior, Asuka was having similar thoughts. It was true enough that the subject was child's play for someone of her intellect and schooling, but the redhead found it odd that despite her lack of exposure to the writing system, still managed to understand what the questions were asking.  
尽管外表冷静，明日香也有类似的思考。确实，对她这样智力和教育背景的人来说，这门学科不过是小儿科，但这位红发少女感到奇怪的是，尽管她对书写系统接触不多，却仍能理解题目在问什么。

When looking at the exam, she'd found that the kanji had become as easy to decipher as her native tongue. Looking at street signs and ads on buildings, she found she could still read the characters. She'd told Shinji that it was because of her natural genius, but that seemed a hollow explanation. Not coming up with a satisfactory justification for the change, the redhead simply chalked the ability to her superior genetic stock.  
当她审视试卷时，发现汉字变得如同母语一样容易解读。看着街上的标志和建筑上的广告，她发现自己仍能读懂这些字符。她曾告诉真嗣，这是因为她的天生才智，但这似乎是一个空洞的解释。找不到满意的解释来解释这种变化，红发少女只好将其归功于自己优越的基因。

---

Even as the children made their way across the city, the HERZ exploratory team led by Makoto Hyuga passed through the decimated remains of Tokyo-3. The great crater stretched farther than could be comfortably thought of, filled to the brim with the strange, red-orange fluid known to a knowledgeable few as LCL.  
就在孩子们穿越城市的同时，由日向实领导的 HERZ 勘探队穿过了被摧毁的第三新东京市遗迹。巨大的陨石坑延伸至令人不安的远方，里面充满了被称为 LCL 的奇异红橙色液体，这一知识仅限于少数人知晓。

Hyuga was never one to be easily flustered, but the cavernous ruins of the few buildings still standing seemed to radiate an unpleasant aura. Maybe it was the strange smell of blood, salt, and rusted iron emanating from the not quite man-made sea. Perhaps it was the muted sunlight that almost refused to touch down in the damned city.  
日向实向来不易慌乱，但那些仍矗立的建筑物废墟似乎散发着一种不悦的气息。或许是那股从非人造海中飘来的血腥、盐味与锈铁的怪异气味。又或许是那几乎拒绝照射在这座被诅咒城市上的黯淡阳光。

It could have been either, but Hyuga couldn't shake the feeling of how large the siege fortress masquerading as a city had been. What once was a center of global affairs and the most important stronghold in human history was now a glorified graveyard, a monument to the dead and gone that were lost and had yet to return from Third Impact.  
可能是其中任何一种，但日向实无法摆脱那种感觉，这座伪装成城市的围攻堡垒曾经是多么庞大。这里曾是全球事务的中心，人类历史上最重要的要塞，如今却沦为一个荣耀的墓地，纪念着那些在第三次冲击中逝去、尚未归来的人们。

No birds sang. There chirp of cicadas that seemed ubiquitous in modern Japan, was conspicuously absent. Nothing natural lived here. Nothing could. Not even weeds would grow in this God forsaken place.  
没有鸟鸣。在日本似乎无处不在的蝉鸣，在这里却明显缺席。这里没有任何自然生命，也无法有。连杂草都不会在这片被神遗弃的地方生长。

And, here he was about to descend into this man-made Hell at the behest of a woman he respected, admired, and loved. And if he felt that life and love were unfair to him, the bespectacled young man kept that to himself.  
而他，即将应一位他尊敬、钦佩且深爱的女性的要求，下到这个人为制造的地狱。如果这位戴眼镜的年轻人觉得生活和爱情对他不公，他也只是将这些感受深藏心底。

Coming to the edge of the bloody sea, Hyuga ordered the team to set up camp. If they'd hurried, the HERZ soldiers and scientists could have managed the begin searching that same day. As it turned out, nobody could muster the strength to move any more expediently than necessary in the face of so much death and destruction.  
来到血海边缘，日向命令队伍扎营。如果他们赶得快，HERZ 的士兵和科学家本可以在当天就开始搜索。但事实证明，面对如此多的死亡和破坏，没有人能鼓起力气比必要的速度更快地行动。

As the sun fell towards the horizon and the search party retired to their tents, Makoto Hyuga reminisced. Working under Katsuragi with Aoba and Ibuki had been fun for all the terror of the Angel attacks. Everything started out so gallantly. He'd helped save the world from total annihilation on a regular basis. And then Katsuragi asked him to investigate for her and he'd learned the truth.  
随着太阳向地平线沉去，搜索队退回帐篷，东治元回忆起来。在葛城手下与青叶和伊吹共事，尽管天使袭击令人恐惧，但一切都很愉快。起初，一切都是那么英勇。他曾定期帮助拯救世界免于彻底毁灭。然后，葛城让他为她调查，他得知了真相。

It was so much easier to be ignorant.  
无知是多么容易。

**Author's Note:** I'm really sorry about the late update. Once again, real life has dragged me, kicking and screaming, away from writing. I suppose I could claim it was a writer's block that kept me from posting. That certainly was part of it, but mostly it was work and family functions. I'll try my best to keep updates coming in quicker succession. As always, review and tell me how I'm doing. Once again, sorry for the very late update and I hope you enjoyed the chapter.  
作者的话：真的很抱歉更新晚了。现实生活再次将我拖离写作，挣扎也无济于事。我本可以声称是写作障碍让我无法发帖。那确实是部分原因，但主要是工作和家庭事务。我会尽力让更新来得更快。一如既往，请评论告诉我你的看法。再次为迟到的更新道歉，希望你喜欢这一章。

### Chapter 5: Milieu  环境
---
Two weeks. It had been two weeks and still the HERZ expeditionary team had come up with absolutely nothing. Dredging the sea, searching the desiccated ruins of Tokyo-3, fanning out into the outer regions of the Impact point, the expedition had no luck in their mission of finding any remains of the original Magi system.  
两周了。HERZ 远征队已经两周了，仍然一无所获。他们拖网搜寻海洋，探查干涸的东京-3 废墟，向冲击点外围区域扩展，但远征队在寻找原始 MAGI 系统遗迹的任务中始终没有运气。

The sea had only yielded the decomposing "flesh" of Rei/Lilith. Thick gobs white skin and muscle that stank of sickly sweet decay. The search teams in the ruinous city similarly turned up empty. Only the husks of what had once been a great testament to human ingenuity and technological might. The skeletons of Man's last great stronghold, empty save for the unnerving feeling of being watched.  
大海只吐露出雷/莉莉丝的腐烂“肉体”。厚厚的白色皮肤和肌肉块，散发着甜腻的腐臭味。废墟城市的搜索队同样一无所获。只剩下曾经是人类智慧和技术力量伟大证明的空壳。人类最后堡垒的骨架，空荡荡的，只剩下一种被监视的不安感。

Still in his hazmat suit, Makoto Hyuga stood at the edge of the Sea of LCL as the sun seemed to sink into the crimson depths. He couldn't help but notice that the sun, reddened as it fell towards the horizon, looked like a gunshot wound in the sky. A bloody hole in Heaven, drowning the world in red.  
仍然穿着防护服的日向诚站在 LCL 之海的边缘，太阳似乎沉入了这血红的深渊。他不禁注意到，夕阳如血，向地平线坠落，宛如天空中的一处枪伤。天国的一个血洞，将世界淹没在红色之中。

Looking out into the scarlet ocean, the Vice-Commander suppressed a slight shiver. Nothing out of the ordinary had happened during his time in the destroyed area, but Tokyo-3 had never been an ordinary place to begin with.  
副指挥官凝视着这片猩红的海洋，压抑住轻微的颤抖。在他驻守在这片毁灭区域的时间里，并没有发生什么异常，但东京-3 从来就不是个寻常之地。

Hyuga wasn't always the most cynical of guys. That was more Aoba's thing. But, everything about his schooling, work, and personal world view forced him to look at the Angels and Eva from a fairly scientific point of view.  
日向并非一直是个悲观主义者，那更像是青叶的特质。然而，他的学业、工作和个人世界观迫使他从相当科学的角度来看待使徒和 EVA。

He'd never truly believed that the Angels were emissaries from God. To him, the name just seemed to come from people with a penchant for the dramatic and who were more than a little self-important. Angels, God, the souls in Eva, those ideas had never held much weight for a man like him. Besides, Angels wouldn't be out to destroy humanity…would they?  
他从未真正相信过使徒是上帝的使者。对他来说，这个名字似乎只是出自那些偏好戏剧化且颇为自负的人之口。使徒、上帝、EVA 中的灵魂，这些概念对像他这样的人来说从未有过多少分量。况且，使徒不会是来毁灭人类的吧……会吗？

That didn't matter anyway. When it came down to it, Hyuga still thought of himself as a man of science. He couldn't exactly explain Instrumentality in terms of numbers and equations, graphs or ratios, but for him there was still some logical source for the event. And, despite constantly reminding himself of that, the Vice-Commander still couldn't shake the feeling of something incredibly _wrong_ in the air.  
无论如何，这并不重要。归根结底，日向仍自视为一个科学人。他无法用数字和方程、图表或比率来解释人类补完计划，但在他看来，这一事件仍有其逻辑根源。尽管他不断提醒自己这一点，副司令仍无法摆脱空气中某种极度不祥的感觉。

In every whispering of wind he heard the voices of unseen people. At night, he could swear the press of human bodies surrounded him, even when he was alone in the team's makeshift headquarters. The presence of intangible people was almost overpowering now, at the edge of the sea of red. At any moment, he half expected a hand on his shoulder or a breath on his neck.  
在每一阵风的低语中，他都听到了看不见的人们的声音。夜晚，他敢肯定，即使独自一人在团队的临时总部，人类的身体也在紧紧包围着他。那些无形之人的存在感现在几乎压倒一切，就在红色海洋的边缘。随时，他都半期待着一只手搭在肩上，或是一股气息拂过颈间。

Watching the surf lazily wash across the sands, Hyuga couldn't help but wonder if Ibuki and Dr. Akagi were in that sea somewhere.  
看着海浪慵懒地冲刷着沙滩，日向不禁想知道，伊吹和赤木博士是否也在那片海中的某个地方。

A voice crackled through the comm. system built into the hazmat suit. "Vice-Commander Hyuga, we think we've found it!" Hyuga's thoughts slammed to a halt. Not for a single second did the bespectacled man ever expect to actually find the original Magi system. It was, along with everything else in NERV HQ, had been wrenched from the earth and left to crash back down. It was unthinkable for anything to still be recognizable from the wreckage.  
一个声音通过内置在防化服中的通讯系统传来，'日向副司令，我们觉得找到了！'日向的思绪戛然而止。这位戴眼镜的男子从未想过真的能找到原始的 MAGI 系统。它和 NERV 总部的一切一样，被从地面上撕扯下来，然后坠落回去。从废墟中还能辨认出任何东西，简直不可思议。

"Get me an escort. I want to see for myself."  
"给我找个护卫。我要亲自去看看。"

---

At the shoreline of the sea, sat part of the original Magi system. Two enormous heaps of steel, copper, plastic, and deep in the heart, flesh. After two weeks of searching, the machines now simply rested on the damp sands of the bloody sea. Hyuga knew that this area had been searched; the kept records were meticulous as to area and time of any single search party's activity. There was only one explanation that came to mind: the Magi were left for them by someone.  
在海岸线上，坐落着部分原始的魔导系统。两堆巨大的钢铁、铜、塑料，以及深藏其核心的肉体。经过两周的搜寻，这些机器如今只是静静地躺在血色海洋的潮湿沙滩上。日向知道这片区域已经被搜查过；保存的记录详细记载了任何一支搜索队伍的活动区域和时间。唯一能想到的解释是：这些魔导系统是有人故意留给他们的。

Hyuga decided to wait until making his written report to think further on the matter. "Prepare to have these airlifted to HERZ headquarters. Is there any theories as to where Casper is?" A technician with a nervous voice spoke up, "Well, we've exchanged ideas sir, but none of them seem to adequately explain why the third portion of the Magi is still missing. Or why Melchior and Balthazar are here to begin with."  
日向决定在撰写书面报告之前不再深思此事。"准备将这些空运到 HERZ 总部。关于卡斯帕的下落有什么理论吗？"一位声音紧张的技术员回答道，"嗯，我们交换了一些想法，先生，但没有一种能充分解释为什么魔导系统的第三部分仍然失踪。或者为什么梅尔基奥和巴尔萨泽会在这里。

Hyuga nodded. "I will be returning to Tokyo-2 with these portions of the Magi system. The rest of the expeditionary team will stay and locate Casper." Hyuga paused for a moment. He was starting to sound like Vice-Commander Fuyutsuki. The bespectacled man wasn't sure how to feel about that. Turning his back on the massive computers, he retreated to the makeshift command center to wait for his transport.  
日向点了点头。"我将带着这部分 MAGI 系统返回第二东京。其余的远征队将留下来寻找卡斯帕。"日向停顿了一下。他开始听起来像副指挥官冬月。这位戴眼镜的男子不确定该如何感受这一点。他转过身，背对着巨大的计算机，退回到临时指挥中心，等待他的交通工具。

A crack of thunder ripped through the closed space. The heavy scent of cordite filled the air. The human shaped target down range was riddled with holes. First Lieutenant Shigeru Aoba calmly ejected the spent clip as he eyed his work. Most of the shots were grouped in the human silhouette's head. Not bad.  
一声雷鸣撕裂了封闭的空间。空气中弥漫着浓重的火药味。远处的那个类人形靶子被子弹打得千疮百孔。少尉青叶茂冷静地弹出空弹夹，审视着自己的成果。大多数子弹都集中在人形轮廓的头部。还不错。

Slamming another clip home, the nihilistic young man quickly cocked his HERZ issued HK USP before unleashing another hail of bullets. With each pull of the trigger he recited a mantra to himself.  
迅速装上另一个弹夹，这位虚无主义的年轻人迅速上膛了他的 HERZ 配发的 HK USP，然后再次倾泻出一片弹雨。每次扣动扳机，他都会对自己默念一句咒语。

"Never again." BLAM! "再也不了。" 砰！

"Never again." BLAM! "再也不了。" 砰！

"Never again." BLAM! "再也不了。" 砰！

This was his ritual. Whenever he had the time, he'd come here and practice. Playing guitar was fun and all, but it wasn't something you could count on if you were in trouble. He wondered if the members of the JSSDF had ever taken time to practice something like guitar. Probably not.  
这是他的仪式。每当有时间，他就会来到这里练习。弹吉他固然有趣，但若真遇到麻烦，这技能却未必能派上用场。他好奇日本自卫队的成员是否也曾抽空练习过吉他这样的技艺。大概不会吧。

Setting the pistol down on the platform before him, Aoba sighed. Not for the first time he wondered if this was actually worth anything. All the practice in the world wouldn't save you from a squad of trained professionals. Real life wasn't like a comic book. How many times had he told Hyuga that?  
将手枪放在面前的平台上，苍叶叹了口气。他不止一次地怀疑这一切是否真的有价值。再多的练习也无法让你从一群训练有素的专业人士手中逃脱。现实生活并非漫画书中的情节。他曾多少次这样告诉日向呢？

Giving a small smile, he returned the pistol to its holster under his jacket. "Looks like I'm the one who's unrealistic."  
他微微一笑，将手枪重新放回外套下的枪套中。"看来，不切实际的反而是我。"

Turning to leave the firing range, Aoba was surprised to see his four-eyed friend. Caught off guard, Aoba paused a moment. "Hey. Aren't you supposed to be out on official business?"  
转身离开射击场时，Aoba 惊讶地看到了他的四眼朋友。措手不及的 Aoba 停顿了一下，问道：“嘿，你不是应该在执行公务吗？”

Hyuga shrugged, "Don't act too happy to see me."  
日向耸了耸肩，“别表现得那么高兴见到我。”

Aoba managed a small smile and offered his hand. "Yeah, sorry. Good to see you back. How was it?"  
Aoba 勉强挤出一个微笑，伸出手说：“嗯，抱歉。很高兴你回来了。一切顺利吗？”

Another shrug, as Makoto shooke his friend's hand. "About as well as you'd imagine. Scorched earth, fallen towers, seas of blood. You know, the usual."  
又是一耸肩，真嗣握了握朋友的手。“和你想象中的差不多。焦土一片，塔楼倾塌，血海滔滔。你知道的，常规操作。”

Making their way out of the range, the two men climbed the stairs up into HERZ headquarters proper. The gunmetal grey walls, interspersed with the deep red HERZ symbol (the silhouette of a fig tree) made the two ex-NERV personnel feel more familiar with the underground complex. And if the similarity to NERV, and the events that took place in that organization, made them uncomfortable they hid it well.  
两人离开射击范围，沿着楼梯爬上 HERZ 总部的正厅。灰色的枪金属墙壁间，点缀着深红色的 HERZ 标志（无花果树的剪影），让这两位前 NERV 成员感到更加熟悉这个地下综合体。如果这种与 NERV 的相似性，以及在那组织中发生的事件让他们感到不适，他们也隐藏得很好。

After chatting amiably for a time, Aoba off handedly wondered, "So, you see any ghosts back home?"  
闲聊了一会儿后，青叶不经意地问道：“那么，你回家后见到什么鬼魂了吗？”

Hyuga didn't answer, instead keeping his head straight forward. Aoba realized that maybe he'd crossed a line, being so nonchalant about the subject. "Jeez, sorry I didn't mean to-"  
日向没有回答，只是直视前方。苍意识到自己可能越界了，对这个话题表现得如此漫不经心。“哎呀，抱歉，我不是故意的——”

Hyuga waved the comment off. "No, it's no big deal. Don't worry about it…. It just felt a little weird there."  
日向摆手表示不在意。“没事，没什么大不了的。别放在心上……只是感觉有点奇怪。”

Aoba cocked an eyebrow. "Weird. What's that supposed to mean? Don't tell me you really think you saw something."  
苍挑了挑眉。“奇怪？你这是什么意思？别告诉我你真的觉得自己看到了什么。”

Shaking his head, the Vice-Commander brushed off the comment. "I didn't say that. It just felt…off."  
副指挥官摇了摇头，对那评论不予理会。“我没那么说。只是感觉……不对劲。”

Rolling his eyes, Aoba muttered, "Come on, of course it's gonna feel 'off.' It's where Third Impact happened. What were you expecting, sunshine and rainbows? Jeez, get your head straight."  
青叶翻了个白眼，低声嘟囔道：“拜托，当然会觉得‘不对劲’。这里可是第三次冲击发生的地方。你还期待什么，阳光和彩虹吗？真是的，清醒点吧。”

Hyuga glared at the Lieutenant out of the corner of his eye. "Is that anyway to be talking to a superior officer? Keep it up and I'll pull rank."  
日向用眼角余光瞪了中尉一眼。“这就是你对上级说话的态度吗？再这样我可要行使职权了。”

Chuckling, Aoba gave his friend an amiable punch on the arm. "Yeah right. You're still First Lieutenant, manga-reading Hyuga to me. How about this: the day you hit it off with Misato, is the day I call you Vice-Commander."  
青叶轻笑一声，友好地给了朋友一拳。“得了吧。在我眼里，你还是那个看漫画的一等中尉日向。这样吧：哪天你和美里关系好了，我再叫你副指挥官。”

The bespectacled man tried his best to force down the heat growing in his cheeks. He failed miserably. "Knock it off with that. It wasn't funny back then, it's not funny now."  
戴眼镜的男子尽力压下脸颊上升腾的热度，却以惨败告终。“别提那事儿了。那时候不好笑，现在也不好笑。”

A group of technicians passed the two, muttering about something uninteresting. Neither man spared a glance at them. Shigeru noticed the hallway to Central Dogma was coming up.  
一群技术人员从两人身边经过，嘀咕着些无聊的事情。两位男士都未曾侧目。茂注意到通往中央教条的走廊就在前方。

Aoba wrapped an arm around his annoyed friend, smiling all the while. "Come on. It was obvious to everyone. I bet Misato was even onto you. You never did a particularly good job at hiding it. Honestly, I don't get what you see in her. Sure, she's good looking and all, but… I figured a nice, quiet girl like Ibuki was more your type."  
青叶用一只胳膊环住他那烦躁的朋友，始终面带微笑。“得了吧。这是明摆着的事。我敢打赌，三笠甚至都察觉到了。你从来就不擅长隐藏。说实在的，我不明白你看上她哪一点。当然，她长得漂亮，但是……我觉得像伊吹那样文静的女孩更适合你。”

Hyuga scratched his head. Aoba may have been a bright guy, but for the most part it seemed that human interaction was a bit of a problem for him. "I- I don't think I was her type. Besides, Misato is capable, interesting, driven…beautiful."  
日向挠了挠头。青叶或许是个聪明人，但在人际交往方面似乎总有些问题。“我——我不认为我是她喜欢的类型。而且，三笠有能力，有趣，有动力……还美丽。”

Giving his friend a strange look, Aoba shrugged curtly. "Alright, whatever you say. If that's how you feel, that's how you feel. Besides, with Kaji gone that means you've got a decent shot at her now, right?"  
青叶用一种奇怪的眼神看了看他的朋友，然后简短地耸了耸肩。“好吧，随你怎么说。如果你这么觉得，那就这么觉得吧。再说，既然卡吉走了，你现在不是有机会追到她了吗？”

Looking at his shoes, Hyuga only managed a quiet, "Maybe."  
低头看着自己的鞋子，日向只是轻声回应了一句：“也许吧。”

Patting his friend on the back with a smile, Aoba began to break paths with his friend. "Hey, I've gotta get to Central Dogma. Some new technicians are supposed to be arriving today. Supposed to replace you and Ibuki." He stopped at the idea of Maya being gone. "It doesn't feel right, does it?"  
拍了拍朋友的背，绿笑着开始与朋友分道扬镳。“嘿，我得去中央教条了。今天有新的技术人员要来，说是要替换你和伊吹。”他一想到玛雅可能离开，就停下了脚步。“感觉不太对劲，是吧？”

Shaking his head the Vice-Commander looked back as his friend. "I guess not. See you later Aoba."  
"副指挥官摇了摇头，回头看向朋友。“我想也是。回头见，绿。””

The two men broke paths and went their separate ways. Hyuga could hear Aoba whistling the chorus to some rock song that had been playing a lot on the radio. Heading to his office, the Vice-Commander passed by Misato's. She'd left the lights on again and her files strewn across her desk.  
两位男士分道扬镳，各自离去。日向能听到青叶吹着口哨，哼着某首电台里经常播放的摇滚歌曲的副歌。他走向自己的办公室，途经美里那里。她又忘了关灯，文件散落一桌。

The Commander may have been moving towards being more organized, but apparently bad habits don't give up without a fight. Opening the door, the young Vice-Commander quickly cleaned up the woman's office, neatly stacking the papers in the center. Looking around, the office seemed…empty. Of course there were sundry items. A file cabinet, desk, chair, a small, fake potted plant. But there were almost no personal effects adorning anything.  
指挥官或许正朝着更有条理的方向迈进，但显然坏习惯不会轻易放弃抵抗。打开门，年轻的副指挥官迅速整理了这位女士的办公室，将文件整齐地堆放在中央。环顾四周，办公室显得……空荡荡的。当然，各种物品还是有的。文件柜、桌子、椅子，还有一盆小巧的假盆栽。但几乎没有任何个人物品装饰。

The only item that gave the room much personality was the picture frame at the top right corner of the Commander's desk. It was a photo of her and the two ex-pilots. Asuka was near the left edge of the picture, her arms folded and her face scowling at the camera. Shinji was trying to force a smile while Misato wrapped her arm around his head and blew the camera a kiss. All in all it seemed a pleasant photo.  
唯一给房间增添些许个性的，是指挥官桌子上右上角的照片框。那是她和两位前驾驶员的合影。明日香站在照片的左侧边缘，双臂交叉，面带怒容地瞪着镜头。真嗣试图挤出一个微笑，而美里则搂着他的头，对着镜头送出一个飞吻。总的来说，这是一张温馨的照片。

After a moment, the Vice-Commander decided that the papers made the desk look untidy. Sliding open a drawer in the desk he almost dropped the papers in, before noticing it. In the drawer was another picture. A photograph of Ryoji Kaji, looking as sly and charming as always, surrounded by a simple silver frame. Hyuga slid the compartment shut and chose a second one to deposit the forms in.  
片刻后，副指挥官觉得这些文件让桌子显得凌乱。他拉开桌子的一个抽屉，差点将文件扔进去，却注意到了里面的东西。抽屉里放着另一张照片。是加持良治的照片，他一如既往地狡黠而迷人，被一个简单的银色相框围绕着。日向顺手将抽屉关上，选择了另一个抽屉来存放这些表格。

Flicking off the light, Makoto Hyuga thought about what his friend had said. _Besides, with Kaji gone that means you've got a decent shot at her now, right?_  
关掉灯，青叶茂回想着朋友的话。而且，既然加持已经不在了，你现在有机会追到她了，对吧？

"Maybe not." “也许未必。”

He closed the door behind him as he left.  
他离开时随手关上了门。

Entering the new Central Dogma, Aoba quickly spotted the two new technicians assigned to assist him and replace Hyuga and Ibuki. The idea didn't quite sit well with him, but the orders came from the top, so good little drones had to do as they were told. A little too much like NERV for comfort.  
进入新的中央指挥室，青叶很快就注意到了被指派来协助他并接替日向和伊吹的两名新技术人员。这个安排让他心里不太舒服，但命令来自高层，作为听话的小卒，只能照做。这感觉太像 NERV 了，让人不安。

The two new technicians were both men in their mid to late twenties. The taller one, standing at 177 centimeters had short black hair, which was messy but looked purposefully so. He had a slight build, but wasn't necessarily a waif. Not exactly a looker, but not strictly unattractive either, the man seemed rather forgettable. All in all, a normal person. His grey eyes looked Aoba up and down, sizing him up. The lieutenant got the feeling he was being looked down on.  
这两名新技术人员都是二十五六岁的男性。较高的那位身高 177 厘米，有着一头凌乱的黑色短发，看起来却像是故意为之。他身材略显瘦削，但并不算纤弱。长相不算出众，也并非毫无吸引力，总之是个容易让人忘记的普通人。他的灰色眼睛上下打量着青叶，似乎在评估他。青叶感觉到自己被轻视了。

The technician gave a sloppy salute. "Ryusuke Nagato, sir." Aoba quickly decided he didn't like the guy.  
技术员懒散地敬了个礼。“长门龙介，长官。”青叶很快就决定他不喜欢这家伙。

The other man quickly followed suit, nervously snapping up straight. He was shorter than the other by at least a head and, unlike his fellow co-worker, almost painfully thin. Whereas Nagato radiated arrogance, this one exuded nervous energy and more than a little fear. Wide, brown eyes and short, stringy brown hair gave the impression of a mouse that might scurry away at any moment. "Y-Yasunobu Ise, s-sir."  
另一个人也迅速效仿，紧张地挺直了身子。他比另一位至少矮了一个头，与他的同事不同，他瘦得几乎让人心疼。长门散发着傲慢，而这人则充满了紧张的能量和不少恐惧。宽大的棕色眼睛和短而稀疏的棕色头发给人一种随时可能逃窜的老鼠的印象。“伊势安昙，长……长官。”

Aoba thought that he looked like a cross between Maya and Shinji. With a sardonic grin he motioned for his new co-workers to ease. "Alright, alright. Enough with the formalities. You're suffocating me here. I'm Shigeru Aoba, nice to meet you."  
青叶觉得他看起来像是玛雅和真嗣的混合体。他带着讽刺的笑容示意新同事们放松。“好了，好了。别那么拘谨。你们快把我闷死了。我是青叶茂，很高兴见到你们。”

The three quickly exchanged handshakes. "So, Ise and Nagato I assume you know most of the commands, order codes and such? Don't have to go over those do I? I hope not."  
三人迅速握手致意。“那么，伊势和长门，我猜你们已经熟悉了大部分指令、命令代码之类的吧？不需要我再重复了吧？希望不用。”

Ise quickly shook his head, "N-no sir. I've got it d-down pat. No problem."  
伊势连忙摇头，“不，不，长官。我已经完全掌握了，没问题。”

Nagato elbowed the smaller technician sharply "Calm down Ise, we're all co-workers here. No reason to be overly formal. We're all guys, right?"  
长门用力地用肘部顶了一下较矮的技术员，“冷静点，伊势，我们都是同事。没必要过于拘谨。大家都是男人，对吧？”

The mousey young man rubbed has arm. "Y-yeah…I guess so." He looked at Aoba as if to ask 'is that ok sir?'  
那个看起来有些胆怯的年轻人揉了揉手臂。“嗯……我想是的。”他看着 Aoba，仿佛在问‘这样可以吗，先生？’

Aoba sat down at his console and leaned back in his chair. Glancing at the scrolling numbers and characters, he noticed that the HERZ mechanical and computer techs had already reconnected part of the Magi system. Hm, fast work.  
Aoba 坐在他的控制台前，向后靠在椅子上。瞥了一眼滚动着的数字和字符，他注意到 HERZ 的机械和计算机技术人员已经重新连接了部分 Magi 系统。嗯，效率真高。

Folding his arms behind his head and kicking back, the senior bridge technician closed his eyes. He thought about working beside Hyuga and Ibuki, sharing jokes while the commanders and pilots were busy doing important work, eating together. He'd never really thought of them as close before, but it suddenly hit Aoba that…they were his only friends. Great, what a time to get sentimental.  
他将双臂枕在脑后，悠闲地伸直双腿，这位资深桥接技术员闭上了眼睛。他想起了与日向和伊吹一起工作的时光，在指挥官和飞行员忙于重要任务时，他们分享笑话，一起用餐。他以前从未真正把他们视为亲密的朋友，但突然间，Aoba 意识到……他们是自己唯一的朋友。真是的，偏偏在这个时候感伤起来。

Ise stuttered again, breaking in on the lieutenant's thoughts. "Uh…s-sir. Sir, something's happening."  
伊势再次结巴起来，打断了副官的思绪。"呃…长官。长官，有情况发生。

Cracking an eye, Aoba gave a cursory glance at the screen. His eyes snapped open as he read the information coming in. Ise and Nagato quickly took their seats, typing away furiously. Aoba turned his head and barked orders. "Get a hold of Hyuga, and Commander Katsuragi! Put out the alert to all personnel to get to their posts! Try to get in contact with the Tokyo-3 expeditionary team!"  
青叶睁开一只眼，草草地瞥了一眼屏幕。当他读到传来的信息时，眼睛猛地睁大。伊势和长野迅速就座，疯狂地敲击键盘。青叶转过头，大声下达命令。"联系日向和葛城司令！向所有人员发出警报，让他们各就各位！尝试与东京-3 远征队取得联系！

Typing a storm Aoba quickly brought the main screen up. On the horizon, out towards the wreckage of Tokyo-3, a pink explosion in the shape of a cross burned faintly. The two Magi agreed. Pattern Blue: Angel.  
青叶飞速敲击键盘，迅速调出主屏幕。在视野的尽头，朝向东京-3 废墟的方向，一个十字形的粉红色爆炸痕迹隐约燃烧着。两台 MAGI 一致判定。模式蓝：天使。

**Author's Note:** I know, I know. A long wait for a short chapter. And no mention of Asuka or Shinji. Don't worry they'll be back next chapter. I don't know why I felt the need to make new characters. Just the mood struck me. This wasn't really a filler chapter…I think. Anyway, the next one will be longer and hopefully sooner, featuring our main characters once more.  
作者的话：我知道，我知道。等了很久却只有一章短篇。而且没有提到明日香或真嗣。别担心，他们下一章就会回来。我不明白为什么我突然想创造新角色。只是灵感来了。这章其实不算填充章节……我想。不管怎样，下一章会更长，希望也更早，再次聚焦我们的主角。

### Chapter 6: Conflict 冲突
**Author's Note:** I know I said I'd update sooner, but, I've been putting of finishing this chapter. In all honesty, I abhorred writing this entire part of the story. I've felt negatively about some of my previous work, but I whole heartedly believe this is my worst update yet and I only put it up to keep the story going. However, maybe I'm wrong. People have said my less-than-exemplary work has been adequate in the past. In any event, I made this chapter longer than the last few to make up for the rather substantial time gap between posts. To the people to take the time to regularly read my work, please accept my most humble apologies.  
作者的话：我知道我说过会更新的快一些，但是，我一直拖着没完成这一章。说实话，我非常讨厌写这一部分的故事。虽然我以前对某些作品也有过负面情绪，但我真心认为这是我有史以来最糟糕的一次更新，我之所以发布它，只是为了保持故事的连贯性。不过，也许我错了。人们曾说过，我那些不甚出色的作品在过去也还算过得去。无论如何，我让这一章比前几章更长，以弥补发布之间相当长的时间间隔。对于那些定期阅读我的作品的朋友们，请接受我最诚挚的歉意。

Shinji Ikari stumbled as the fist connected with his jaw. The blow staggered the relatively small boy, sending him back several paces and filling his mouth with the coppery taste of blood. He only had a moment to notice that the punch didn't hurt as much as the first time a fellow student had struck him. Toji hit harder.  
碇真嗣被一拳击中下巴，踉跄了几步。这一击让身材相对瘦小的他后退了好几步，嘴里充满了血的铁锈味。他只有片刻时间注意到，这次被打并没有第一次被同学打时那么痛。东治的拳头更重。

A second blow rocked his left temple, sent him reeling. Wobbling several more steps aside, the boy's head swam. Haze drifted through his thoughts as he tried to keep his feet under him. A follow up blow crashed into his stomach, sending the air rushing out of his body. Doubling over and dropping to his knees, the Third Child held his abdomen and futilely tried to draw wind into his lungs.  
又一记重击砸在他的左太阳穴，让他踉跄后退。摇晃着再走了几步，少年的头昏沉沉的。他的思绪中弥漫着迷雾，努力稳住脚步。紧接着，一拳猛击在他的腹部，使他体内的空气急速排出。他弯下腰，跪倒在地，第三适格者捂着肚子，徒劳地试图吸入空气。

Hunched over, gasping at the strangely elusive air, the boy wondered what he'd done to deserve the beating. Not that being beaten up on was something entirely uncommon for him. Since coming back to school, he'd been the target of a few overbearing students who wanted to make themselves look menacing. He didn't like it, but he supposed he didn't mind terribly. He'd been through far worse in his time.  
弯着腰，喘着气，却感觉空气异常难以捕捉，少年疑惑自己究竟做了什么要遭受这样的殴打。不过，被欺负对他来说并非完全陌生。自从回到学校以来，他成了几个想要显得凶狠的学生的目标。他不喜欢这样，但也觉得并不是特别介意。毕竟，他经历过更糟糕的事情。

The first time Shinji had ever been assaulted at school was because of his clumsy piloting of that humanoid weapon of mass destruction: Evangelion Unit-01. However, Shinji had gratefully given up piloting the man-made atrocity and everything that entailed.  
真嗣第一次在学校遭受攻击，是因为他那笨拙的操纵着那个大规模杀伤性人形兵器：初号机。然而，真嗣已经感激地放弃了驾驶这个人工制造的恐怖机器以及与之相关的一切。

Now, the Third Child was simply a meek, uninteresting, cowardly, school boy who wanted nothing more than to be left alone and calmly drift through life. This of course, was a large part the reason he'd been so eagerly assaulted. A rather unimposing figure with no fight left in him, Shinji was simply an easy target.  
如今，第三适格者不过是个温顺、乏味、怯懦的学童，只求能被置之不理，平静地度过一生。当然，这很大程度上也是他为何如此急切地遭到攻击的原因。一个毫无威慑力、斗志全无的形象，真嗣不过是个容易对付的目标。

Piloting Eva had caused him nothing but misery. Living a normal life was proving to be difficult precisely because he was nobody special. It seemed that no matter what sort of life he lived, the boy would be destined to endure hardship.  
驾驶 EVA 带给他的只有痛苦。过上正常生活正变得困难，正是因为他平凡无奇。似乎无论他选择何种生活，这个少年注定要承受苦难。

Sometimes Shinji wondered if God had slapped a spiritual "Kick Me" sign on his back. If that were the case, it meant the Almighty either **A)** had a strange sense of humor or **B)** was a total asshole.  
有时，真嗣怀疑上帝是否在他背上贴了一个精神上的“踢我”标志。如果真是这样，那意味着全能者要么 A)有着奇怪的幽默感，要么 B)完全是个混蛋。

Shinji hoped it was "A."  
真嗣希望是"A"。

Finally breathing through ragged gasps, the fallen boy had the presence of mind to be grateful that his assailant hadn't kicked him yet. Still, the former pilot couldn't think up any reason someone would make the effort to hurt him. As far as he knew he hadn't slighted anyone.  
终于透过断断续续的喘息，倒下的男孩还有意识去感激袭击者尚未踢他。尽管如此，这位前飞行员想不出任何理由会有人费力伤害他。据他所知，他并没有得罪任何人。

Feeling the blood trickle from his mouth and down the left side of his face, he supposed the point was moot.  
感觉到血从嘴里流出，顺着左脸颊淌下，他觉得这个问题已经没有讨论的必要了。

Looking down at the huddled boy bleeding on the ground, Kazuki Aikawa sneered derisively. The unpleasant expression seemed out of place on his handsome face. A dark haired boy with uncanny good looks, a bright mind, and a physical aptitude that most would kill for, Aikawa should have been above associating with someone like Shinji Ikari.  
俯视着蜷缩在地、血迹斑斑的男孩，相川和树冷笑一声，不屑之情溢于言表。这副不悦的神情与他俊美的面容格格不入。拥有深邃黑发、非凡美貌、聪颖才智以及常人梦寐以求的体能，相川本应不屑与碇真嗣这样的人为伍。

However, certain events had made the confrontation necessary, and Aikawa could only think one thing. This was pathetic.  
然而，某些事件使得这场对峙不可避免，相川心中唯有一念：这真是可悲至极。

Shinji Ikari was some nothing little wimp who got mediocre grades and played cello for the music club. There wasn't anything special about him. In truth, the kid had more working against him than for him. He never had much to say, was piss poor in anything athletic, and was way more antisocial than was healthy. A waste of space. Even so, he'd expected at least some sort of resistance.  
碇真嗣不过是成绩平平、在音乐社拉大提琴的无名小卒。他并无特别之处。实际上，他面临的困境远多于优势。他寡言少语，体育方面一塌糊涂，社交能力更是差得令人担忧。简直是浪费空间。即便如此，相川原以为至少会遇到一点反抗。

Then, what did Asuka see in this pathetic bastard?  
那么，明日香到底在这个可怜虫身上看到了什么？

Ikari was the only person that Asuka even vaguely showed any interest in. She kept away from the female cliques and shot down any poor sap dumb enough to ask her on a date. Of course, there was still no shortage of students trying to get in close to the foreign wonder.  
碇是明日香唯一稍显兴趣的人。她远离女生小团体，对任何胆敢向她提出约会的可怜家伙都毫不留情地拒绝。当然，仍有不少学生试图接近这位异国佳人。

'Would you consider joining our club?'  
“你愿意考虑加入我们的社团吗？”

'Want to be friends?' '想成为朋友吗？'

'Will you go out with me?'  
'你愿意和我约会吗？'

But, was it really any surprise that the red haired marvel was attracting so much attention? She had the highest marks in the class, was obscenely proficient at anything vaguely athletic, and played first seat violin in the music club. She was smart, funny, capable, and above all, beautiful. And Kazuki had to have her.  
但是，这位红发奇才吸引如此多的关注，真的令人惊讶吗？她在班上成绩最好，对任何稍微涉及体育的事情都异常擅长，还是音乐俱乐部首席小提琴手。她聪明、幽默、能干，最重要的是，美丽动人。而和树必须得到她。

Of course, he'd asked her out. How could she turn down the great Aikawa? He was one of the highest scoring students in the prefecture, the baseball team's star shortstop, and one of best looking guys ever to grace the halls of this second rate junior high. He was just as much of a phenomenon as the German girl. Then why, why, why?! Why had she turned him down?!  
当然，他向她发出了邀约。她怎能拒绝伟大的相川呢？他是县内成绩最顶尖的学生之一，棒球队的明星游击手，也是这所二流初中里最英俊的男生之一。他和那位德国女孩一样，都是校园里的传奇人物。那为什么，为什么，为什么？！她为什么要拒绝他？！

Any idiot with eyes in his head would see that the two were perfect for each other! Two superior students would only naturally be drawn together. Despite the obvious truth of it all, Soryu had still turned him down. The images paraded through his thoughts again. The day he'd confessed to Soryu.  
任何一个有眼睛的人都能看出，他们俩是天造地设的一对！两个优秀的学生自然会相互吸引。尽管这一切显而易见，空龙还是拒绝了他。那些画面再次在他的思绪中游行。那一天，他向空龙表白了。

Kazuki Aikawa was unaccustomed to being rejected, but was not completely unprepared for it. He'd dated girls who, at first, were too shy to admit they liked him. If Asuka were to turn him down, he assumed that would be the manner in which she would do so. However, such was not the case.  
相川一树不习惯被拒绝，但也不是完全没有准备。他曾和那些一开始因为害羞而不敢承认喜欢他的女孩交往过。如果飞鸟拒绝他，他以为她会以那种方式拒绝。然而，事实并非如此。

He'd strode up to her right after class ended, offered to take her out, and waited for her to jump at the chance. His cocky self-assuredness shattered when he heard Soryu begin to laugh.  
下课后，他大步流星地走到她面前，提出要带她出去，等待着她迫不及待地抓住这个机会。然而，当他听到 Soryu 开始笑起来时，他那自信满满的态度瞬间崩溃了。

Unfamiliar warmth filled his cheeks and a long since discarded emotion wormed in his stomach. Kazuki Aikawa was embarrassed.  
陌生的暖意涌上他的脸颊，一种久违的情感在胃里蠕动。相川一树感到尴尬了。

It was uncommon for any girl to turn him down. It was unthinkable for one to simply laugh of his advances. And yet this girl had done just that, making him look like a fool in front of the whole class. She was saying something now, berating him mercilessly, but he couldn't hear her over the furious haze clouding his thoughts.  
任何女孩拒绝他都是罕见的。对他的追求嗤之以鼻更是难以想象。然而，这个女孩不仅这么做了，还在全班面前让他显得像个傻瓜。她现在正在说些什么，无情地斥责他，但在他脑海中愤怒的迷雾中，他什么也听不见。

The girl stopped when she was tired of insulting him and made her way to a meek boy at the back of the class. The boy was listening to music and looking out the window. Apparently he hadn't noticed the occurrence at all. Asuka yanked the ear phones from Ikari's head and after a half-hearted attempt at being malicious, led the boy out of the room.  
女孩在辱骂他到厌倦后停了下来，走向教室后排一个温顺的男孩。那男孩正听着音乐，望着窗外。显然他完全没有注意到刚才发生的事情。明日香一把扯下碇的耳机，半真半假地表现出恶意后，便领着男孩走出了房间。

It had been a week since that day and all Aikawa had done was seethe. He ran the events of that day over and over in his thoughts and come to one conclusion. Soryu didn't dislike him; she was just preoccupied with Ikari.  
自那天起已过去一周，相川所做的只是愤怒。他反复回想那天的情景，最终得出一个结论。苏流并不是讨厌他；她只是被碇的事情分心了。

Ikari. 碇。

Soryu should have been happily dating him, just about ready to give it up. Instead, she hung around that wuss, Ikari. Asuka and the wimp had both denied that they were dating, but it was obvious that there was something going on between the two of them. Maybe they weren't dating yet, but something was bound to happen.  
Soryu 本应快乐地与他交往，几乎准备放弃一切。然而，她却围着那个懦夫 Ikari 转。Asuka 和那个懦夫都否认他们在约会，但很明显他们之间有些什么。也许他们还没开始约会，但迟早会发生些什么。

So, to show Asuka that Ikari was a waste of time and blow off some steam while doing so, Kazuki had decided to pick a fight with the mopey student. However, despite his best efforts, Ikari had refused to be drawn out. In the face of taunts, insults, and threats of bodily harm, the quiet student simply shrugged and said,  
因此，为了向 Asuka 证明 Ikari 只是在浪费时间，同时发泄一下情绪，Kazuki 决定找这个闷闷不乐的学生挑起争端。尽管他尽了最大努力，Ikari 却拒绝被激怒。面对挑衅、侮辱和身体伤害的威胁，这位沉默的学生只是耸了耸肩，说道，

"I don't want to fight anymore."  
"我不想再打架了。"

The Third Child's detached responses only served to fuel Aikawa's ire. After several minutes of trying to provoke the intransigent boy, Kazuo began to lose his patience. The haughty student lashed out with a quick left hand, slamming into the right side of Shinji's face.  
第三适格者的冷漠回应反而激起了相川的怒火。经过几分钟试图激怒这个顽固的男孩后，和夫开始失去耐心。这位傲慢的学生迅速挥出左手，猛击真嗣的右脸颊。

Throwing all of his weight behind the blow, Kazuki's jaw almost dropped when he realized that the seemingly made of glass wimp didn't go down. Stepping forward and swinging hard, Kazuki slammed his right fist into Shinji's temple. Still the boy remained on his feet. Growling, Aikawa punched low, sending a crushing blow into Ikari's stomach.  
和树将全身重量都压在这一击上，当他意识到这个看似脆弱的胆小鬼竟然没有倒下时，几乎惊掉了下巴。他向前一步，用力挥拳，右拳重重击中真嗣的太阳穴。然而，男孩依然站立不倒。咆哮着，相川再次出拳，一记重击打在碇的腹部。

The oppressive student grinned in satisfaction as his blow caused Shinji to cry out in a strange warble, the air rushing from his lungs. The meek boy crumpled to the ground, his arms latched around his midsection, gasping for air.  
这位霸道的学生满意地咧嘴一笑，他的打击让真嗣发出奇怪的颤音，空气从他的肺中急速排出。这个温顺的男孩蜷缩在地，双臂紧紧抱住腹部，喘息着试图呼吸。

'Much better,' Kazuki thought to himself as he glared down at the fallen boy at his feet, 'This is what it should be like. A pathetic wimp like Ikari should be bowing before me.' And still the feelings of rejection and anger didn't wane.  
'好多了，' 一之濑想，他低头瞪着倒在地上的男孩，'这才是应有的样子。像伊刈这样的可怜虫就应该在我面前低头。' 然而，被拒绝和愤怒的感觉并未消退。

Looking around, Kazuo realized that a crowd had drawn around the scuffle. Casting only a cursory glance across the faces gathered around him, Aikawa quickly found a beautiful redhead glaring at him from the sea of faces. The boy stopped smiling when he saw the look the exotic girl's face.  
环顾四周，一之仓意识到一场打斗已经吸引了围观的人群。他只是粗略地扫视了一圈周围的面孔，很快就从人群中找到了一个美丽的红发女孩，正用锐利的目光盯着他。当男孩看到这位异国女孩脸上的表情时，他停止了微笑。

She was disgusted. 她感到厌恶。

Since returning to school, Asuka had been bored. The tests were all subjects she knew inside and out, the people were painfully dull, and the clubs never fulfilled the need in her chest that piloting Eva had. Of course she was exemplary at anything she did, but that was hardly the point.  
自从回到学校，明日香就一直感到无聊。那些考试科目她都了如指掌，周围的人无聊至极，而社团活动也从未满足过她心中驾驶 EVA 的那种渴望。当然，她无论做什么都是出类拔萃的，但这根本不是重点。

Being extraordinary in mundane activities was something anyone could do. With enough practice, enough time, and enough tenacity, someone could become just as clever, fit, and skilled as she was. Eva had been different.  
在平凡活动中表现出色，这是任何人都能做到的。只要有足够的练习、时间和毅力，任何人都可以变得和她一样聪明、健康和熟练。但驾驶 EVA 是不同的。

In the whole of the world there were only a select few who could pilot Eva and she had been one of them. After fighting enormous monsters in a stories-high mech, everything else in life seemed to take a back seat. Nothing could possibly be as important as what she had already done.  
全世界只有少数人能驾驶 EVA，而她就是其中之一。在驾驶着高楼大厦般巨大的机甲与巨型怪兽战斗之后，生活中的其他一切都显得无足轻重。没有什么能比她已经做到的事情更重要了。

It was an odd feeling, doing your most important work at such a young age. School had been boring when she was an Eva pilot, but at least then she had cared if she impressed her peers. After Third Impact, scholastic achievements were simply things to take up time.  
在如此年轻的时候做着最重要的工作，这种感觉颇为奇妙。当她还是 Eva 驾驶员时，学校生活虽然乏味，但至少她还关心是否能给同龄人留下深刻印象。第三次冲击之后，学业成就不过是消磨时间的工具罢了。

Her fellow students no longer held any interest for her at all. The people at school weren't exactly unpleasant; they just weren't appealing to the ex-pilot. They all seemed so…boring.  
她对同学们的兴趣已荡然无存。学校里的人并非不友好，只是对这位前驾驶员来说，他们毫无吸引力。他们看起来都那么……无聊。

More often than not, she found herself talking to and spending time with Shinji. He was still an idiot and would go through bouts of depression and mope about if the mood struck him, but she'd learned to tolerate such things from him. In fact she tolerated a lot of things from Shinji she wouldn't from others.  
她发现自己越来越多地与真嗣交谈和共度时光。他依旧是个傻瓜，情绪一上来就会陷入抑郁，闷闷不乐，但她已经学会忍受他这些毛病。事实上，她对真嗣的容忍度远超其他人。

However much she tolerated them didn't mean she approved of those traits. In fact, she tried her best to get the boy to change. So far, it was slow going. It was in the spirit of trying to change the former pilot of Unit-01 that Asuka was letting Kazuki Aikawa hammer away at the unassuming boy.  
尽管她容忍了他们，但这并不意味着她赞同那些特质。事实上，她尽力让那个男孩改变。到目前为止，进展缓慢。正是出于试图改变前任零号机驾驶员的精神，明日香让相川一树对那个不起眼的男孩进行锤炼。

She remembered Aikawa. He was supposed to be some sort of genius. Good at sports, athletics, academics, and fairly good looking to boot. Of course, he was nowhere near her level, but that never stopped him from pretending he was. He had a handsome face, black hair that he wore slicked back, and a pretentious air of entitlement. When he approached her, Asuka told him to stop having ideas above his station.  
她记得相川。他应该是个天才。擅长体育、运动、学业，而且长得还算不错。当然，他远不及她的水平，但这从未阻止他假装自己能比。他有一张英俊的脸，黑发向后梳得油光水滑，还有一股自命不凡的优越感。当他接近她时，明日香告诉他别妄想超越自己的地位。

Now, like a spoiled child, the spurned Kazuki was taking his frustrations out on Shinji. Asuka didn't like it, but allowed for the beating to continue. It was for Shinji's own good that he learn to stand on his own and fight back. He'd always been too quiet and self-sacrificing.  
现在，像个被宠坏的孩子，被拒绝的相川将他的挫败感发泄在真嗣身上。明日香不喜欢这样，但允许这种打击继续下去。这是为了让真嗣学会自立并反击，他总是太沉默和自我牺牲了。

Despite all of her best intentions, Asuka still felt sick as Shinji fell to his knees. She couldn't quite isolate the feeling of revulsion that worked it's from the pit of her stomach. The disgust might have been aimed towards Kazuo, for picking on an obviously pacifistic boy. Maybe it was because Shinji was too pathetic to beat an ordinary junior high student despite all of his NERV required self-defense training.  
尽管阿苏卡本意良好，但当真嗣跪倒在地时，她仍感到一阵恶心。她无法准确分辨那种从胃底涌起的厌恶感。这种厌恶可能是针对一夫的，因为他欺负一个明显爱好和平的男孩。也许是因为真嗣太无能，尽管接受了 NERV 要求的所有自卫训练，却连一个普通初中生都打不过。

Or perhaps, maybe, possibly… deep down she felt sick with herself for not stepping in to help one of the only people close to her.  
又或许，可能，或许……深藏在心底，她对自己没有介入帮助唯一亲近的人感到恶心。

Crushing the feelings forming in her chest, Asuka scoffed to herself. "No reason to get overly sentimental. This is Shinji we're talking about."  
"阿苏卡压抑住胸中涌动的情绪，自嘲地嗤笑一声。“没必要过于感伤。我们说的是真嗣。””

Still, she didn't take any pleasure in having to watch the boy get hurt.  
尽管如此，她并不乐意看到那个男孩受伤。

---

Looking down at Ikari, Kazuki wondered why Asuka was so upset. This was proof that he was the better man. She had to see that he was a better option than the boy quivering in the dirt.  
低头看着碇，一树不明白明日香为何如此难过。这正是证明他更优秀的证据。她必须明白，他比那个在泥土中颤抖的男孩更值得选择。

She couldn't still be sticking up for that piece of shit on the ground…could she? Anger welled up in the boy's chest as he glanced between the disgusted girl and the prone wimp.  
她不会还在为地上那个废物辩护吧……她会吗？当男孩在厌恶的女孩和躺着的懦夫之间来回看时，怒火在他胸中升腾。

Walking around the downed Shinji, Kazuki drew his right leg back. Swiftly lashing out, the vicious student slammed his foot into the former Eva pilot's ribs.  
绕过倒地的真嗣，和树后撤右腿。迅速出击，这名凶狠的学生一脚猛踢在原 Eva 驾驶员的肋骨上。

Flinching, Asuka watched as Shinji clutched at his abdomen again. It was obvious he'd had the wind knocked out of him once more, his eyes screwed shut, his forehead pressing into the dirt.  
阿苏卡一缩，看着真嗣再次捂住腹部。显然他又被打得喘不过气来，双眼紧闭，额头紧贴着泥土。

"You see?" Kazuki said, grinning widely at the squirming child on the ground, "You're nothing compared to me. Honestly, I don't see what that stupid bitch sees in you."  
“看到了吗？”和树对着在地上扭动的孩子咧嘴笑道，“你跟我比什么都不是。老实说，我不明白那个蠢婊子看上你哪一点。”

Drawing back for another kick, the baseball star suddenly realized that he was looking up at the sky. He was on his back…and his face hurt. His mind clearing through a strange haze, Kazuki found that he was in agony.  
正准备再次踢球，这位棒球明星突然意识到他在仰望天空。他躺在地上……而且脸很疼。在一种奇怪的迷雾中清醒过来，和树发现他正痛苦不堪。

Writhing on the ground, clutching his face, the boy cried out as a warm liquid seeped between his fingers. Through teary eyes, he watched as blood rushed into his hands. Carefully exploring his face, he cried sharply as his fingers grazed his nose.  
在地上扭动着，捂着脸，男孩哭喊着，一股温热的液体从他的指缝间渗出。透过泪眼，他看到血涌入他的手中。小心翼翼地触摸自己的脸，当他的手指碰到鼻子时，他痛得尖叫起来。

Bracing against the pain, Aikawa carefully prodded at the extremity. Bright lights flashed in his eyes as he tactilely inspected the damage. "Oh God," he managed as he realized what had happened, "Oh God, my nose! My nose is broken!"  
忍着疼痛，相川小心翼翼地触碰着受伤的部位。当他用手检查伤势时，眼前闪过明亮的光。"哦，天啊，"他意识到发生了什么，"哦，天啊，我的鼻子！我的鼻子断了！

As if coming to the conclusion cleared the last of the mental cobwebs, Kazuki remembered what had transpired. He'd drawn back to kick Ikari (that stupid fucking dog) and then there'd been a flash of red.  
仿佛得出结论清除了最后一丝心智的迷雾，和希记起了发生的事情。他后退一步准备踢向伊卡里（那该死的蠢狗），然后眼前闪过一道红光。

Asuka had moved faster than anyone he'd ever seen, closing the ten meter distance between them as if it were nothing. Stepping severely with her right foot, the agile foreign girl pivoted sharply, raising her left leg as she spun.  
明日香的动作快得超乎他所见过的任何人，十米的距离在她面前仿佛不存在。她右脚重重踏地，敏捷的外国少女猛地转身，同时左腿高高抬起。

The high kick connected with the sharp snap of breaking cartilage. The force of the blow sent Kazuo through the air, landing harshly on his back some 150 centimeters from where he'd started.  
"这一记高踢正中目标，伴随着鼻骨断裂的清脆声响。强大的冲击力将和夫击飞，重重地摔在他起始位置约 150 厘米外的地面上。

The pain seemed to renew its efforts in light of the revelation, sending the boy into new spasms. Rolling on the ground, clutching at his face he could only manage a simple refrain. "You bitch, you bitch, you stupid fucking bitch!"  
这痛苦似乎因这揭露而加剧，使男孩陷入新的痉挛。他在地上翻滚，捂着脸，只能断断续续地咒骂：“你这贱人，你这贱人，你这愚蠢透顶的贱人！”

Ignoring the screams, Asuka casually strolled past the squirming student and lowered herself to one knee next to the pitiful form of Shinji Ikari. Reaching out to touch the boy's face, she stopped herself. "You ok? Can you walk?" There was no roughness in the question, her voice uncharacteristically soft.  
无视尖叫声，明日香漫不经心地走过扭动着的学生，蹲下身子，单膝跪在可怜的碇真嗣旁边。她伸手想要触摸男孩的脸，却又停住了。“你还好吗？能走吗？”这个问题中没有丝毫粗鲁，她的声音出奇地柔和。

Raising his head, Shinji did his best to focus on the girl next to him and not the crippling pain in his midsection. Taking in the redhead's face, the Third Child was mildly surprised to see something almost out of place painted across her features. She was genuinely concerned.  
真嗣抬起头，尽力将注意力集中在身边的女孩身上，而不是腹部那令人崩溃的疼痛。他注视着红发女孩的脸，第三适格者有些惊讶地发现她的表情中竟流露出一种几乎不合时宜的情绪。她是真的在担心。

He should have felt happy to see her worry over him. The boy had always wanted someone to care about what happened to him. For a time, he didn't care who it was. He simply needed the assurance that somebody felt enough for him to care one way or another if something happened to him.  
他本应因看到她为他担忧而感到高兴。这个男孩一直渴望有人关心他的遭遇。有一段时间，他不在乎那个人是谁。他只是需要有人在乎他，无论发生什么，都能给予他关怀。

He couldn't say exactly when that general feeling began to specify itself. He could only say for certain that, at some point, the desire to be cared for was suddenly personified in Asuka.  
他无法确切地说出那种普遍的感觉何时开始具体化。他只能肯定，在某一刻，渴望被关心的愿望突然具象化为明日香。

Had the idea slowly grown during the training to fight the 7th Angel? Perhaps it had been a sudden epiphany when he'd leapt into the searing heat of an active volcano to save her. Maybe it hadn't been either and was simply the culmination of sharing a close space for so long. It didn't matter, he felt something more than a simple closeness to her.  
这种想法是在对抗第七使徒的训练中逐渐形成的吗？或许是在他跳入炽热的活火山去救她时突然领悟的。也可能两者都不是，仅仅是长时间共享狭小空间的必然结果。这并不重要，他感觉到与她之间不仅仅是简单的亲近。

That connection was the reason he felt guilty when he saw the concern in her eyes. All his life he'd only ever been trouble for others. Even after swearing that he wouldn't be a burden to anyone anymore, he'd managed to screw up again.  
那种联系是他看到她眼中的关切时感到内疚的原因。他一生中只为别人带来麻烦。即使发誓不再成为任何人的负担，他还是再次搞砸了。

"Yeah," he managed a short nod, "I'm fine."  
“嗯，”他勉强点了点头，“我没事。”

Relief seemed to wash over her face, "That's good," the redhead noted. Suddenly, the worry and compassion vanished from Asuka's face, replaced with a hard glare that almost made the boy recoil. "Because, I'm not going to carry you home! Get up Stupid."  
似乎松了一口气，她脸上的表情缓和了，“那就好，”红发女孩说道。突然，明日香脸上的担忧和同情消失了，取而代之的是一道严厉的目光，几乎让男孩后退。“因为，我不会背你回家的！起来，笨蛋。”

For a moment Shinji wasn't sure he was looking at the same girl. 'So much for compassion.' Straining his body, the wiry ex-pilot managed to struggle to his feet. Wobbling for a moment, the beaten boy stumbled before steadying himself.  
有那么一刻，真嗣不确定自己看到的是不是同一个女孩。'同情心也就这样了。'他费力地撑起瘦弱的身体，前驾驶员勉强挣扎着站了起来。摇晃了一会儿，这个受伤的男孩踉跄了几步，然后才稳住自己。

Breathing deeply, he winced as a sharp pain raced through his abdomen. The next few days were going to be hell. "Hey, Asuka," turning to look at his companion, Shinji noticed the crowd of students for the first time. Being face down in the dirt has a way of keeping your attention from small things like that.  
他深吸一口气，腹部一阵剧痛让他皱起了眉头。接下来的几天将会是地狱般的煎熬。"嘿，明日香，"他转头看向同伴，这才第一次注意到周围聚集的学生们。脸朝下趴在泥土里，自然无暇顾及这些小事。

Murmurs began to move through the assembly. Half heard voices reached Shinji's ears as students whispered to each other.  
低语声开始在集会中传播开来。学生们互相窃窃私语，断断续续的声音传入了真嗣的耳中。

"…why didn't he fight back?"  
"……为什么他不反抗呢？"

"He got lucky; Kazuki was going to seriously hurt him…"  
"他运气好；和希是真的想狠狠地伤害他……"

"…how can he call himself a man? He got saved by a girl…"  
"……他怎么好意思自称男人？竟然被一个女孩救了……"

"…I can't believe he's still able to stand up after that. What's he made out of?"  
"…我真不敢相信他挨了那一下还能站起来。他到底是什么做的？"

Suddenly very uncomfortable, Shinji shifted from one foot to the other, not sure what to do. Luckily, the boy had Asuka. Flashing a glare that could stop a JSSDF soldier in his tracks, the imposing redhead silenced the gathered students. "Don't you people have to be getting home?"  
突然感到非常不自在，真嗣左右挪动着脚步，不知该如何是好。幸好，他有明日香在。这位威严的红发少女投去一道能令日本自卫队士兵止步的凌厉目光，顿时让聚集的学生们噤声。“你们这些人不该回家了吗？”

The assembled students ambled about for a time, not exactly ready to leave. After all, Kazuki was still groaning quietly to himself in the dirt. Stomping, the strawberry haired beauty suddenly became fear given human form, "I said get going!"  
聚集的学生们徘徊了一会儿，并不急于离开。毕竟，和树还在泥土中低声呻吟。突然间，那位草莓色头发的美人变得如同恐惧化为人形，她跺着脚厉声道：“我说了，快走！”

Not willing to tempt fate by angering the girl any further, the milling crowd scurried apart and the students all went their separate ways. The lack of the crowd left the area outside the school feeling decidedly lonely. Or perhaps it was serene, aside from the groans of Kazuki Aikawa. Shinji couldn't tell.  
不愿再激怒那女孩而招致命运的捉弄，围观的众人迅速散开，学生们各自离去。人群的消失让校外的区域显得格外孤寂。或许该说是宁静，除了相川一树的呻吟声，真嗣无法分辨。

Starting off without casting a single glance at her fellow ex-pilot, Asuka merrily made her way towards the apartment. The bloodied ex-pilot cast a short glance at the slowly recovering form of his assailant. Quickly moving to keep pace with his companion, Shinji forced himself to walk normally. He found it to be very hard work.  
连一眼都没看向曾经的同伴，明日香愉快地朝公寓走去。那位血迹斑斑的前驾驶员短暂地瞥了一眼正在慢慢恢复的袭击者。为了跟上同伴，真嗣强迫自己正常行走，他发现这非常费力。

Following behind the bright, cheerful girl, Shinji strained to keep up. Watching her swaying red hair, the Third Child felt a strange resentment in his chest. Why had she waited to help him? Why didn't she step in earlier? She could have spared him this pain, so why did she wait? The question gnawed at him, refusing to go unanswered.  
跟在那个明亮、欢快的女孩后面，真嗣努力跟上。看着她摇曳的红发，第三适格者感到胸中涌起一股莫名的怨恨。她为什么等到现在才帮他？为什么不早点介入？她本可以让他免受这份痛苦，为何要等待？这个问题困扰着他，不容忽视。

Passing a bus bench, the boy stopped, as much to catch his breath and rest as to satisfy his curiosity. The boy sat and called out, "Hey, Asuka," he began, his eyes looking at the dried blood that stained his hand, "Why'd you wait?"  
经过一个公交车站的长椅时，男孩停了下来，既是为了喘口气休息，也是为了满足自己的好奇心。男孩坐下并喊道：“嘿，明日香，”他开始说，眼睛盯着手上干涸的血迹，“你为什么等我？”

The pretty girl stopped, turning to face the question. "Huh? What do you mean?" Looking upon the boy's face, Asuka expected to see anger or displeasure. She found uncertainty instead.  
漂亮的女孩停下脚步，转身面对这个问题。“啊？你什么意思？”看着男孩的脸，明日香本以为会看到愤怒或不悦。然而，她看到的却是犹豫不决。

"When I was…fighting Kazuki, you didn't…" He stopped, Misato's voice echoing in his ears. _Hiding behind the skirt of a little girl at a time like this?! Snap out of it!_  
当我……和一树战斗时，你没有……”他停了下来，耳边回响着美里的话。在这种时候躲在一个小女孩的裙后？！振作起来！

How pathetic. Not only had he been saved by Asuka, he was wondering why she hadn't saved him sooner. "No, it's nothing."  
多么可悲。他不仅被明日香救了，还在纳闷她为什么没有早点救他。“不，没什么。”

Pursing her lips, Asuka thought about offering some words of comfort, but couldn't think of anything she was willing to say. "Well then, stop slowing us down and let's go." Muttering as she walked on, the girl didn't spare a backward glance. Shinji forced himself to his feet and followed quietly, wallowing in self-loathing.  
明日香抿着嘴唇，想说出几句安慰的话，却想不出愿意说出口的。“那好，别拖后腿了，我们走。”她边走边嘟囔，没有回头看一眼。真嗣强迫自己站起来，默默地跟在后面，沉浸在自我厌恶中。

---

Upon arriving at the apartment, the students were surprised to find their guardian lounging in front of the television. Usually at this time she was at work, but apparently HERZ was more willing to grant time off than NERV. Peeking up from the couch, the dark haired woman gave a quick wave and smile. "Hey you two, how was school?"  
到了公寓，学生们惊讶地发现他们的监护人正懒洋洋地坐在电视机前。通常这个时候她应该在工作，但显然 HERZ 比 NERV 更愿意给予休假。黑发女子从沙发上抬头，快速挥了挥手并微笑着问：“嘿，你们俩，学校怎么样？”

"Fine." Shinji mumbled as he continued towards his room, not slowing down a whit. Asuka cheerily hummed to herself as she made her way next to the couch. Resting her chin in her hands while leaning against the sofa, the girl happily announced, "The Third got into a fight again."  
"好的。" 真嗣嘟囔着继续走向自己的房间，丝毫没有放慢脚步。明日香则愉快地哼着小曲，走到沙发旁。她双手托腮，倚靠在沙发上，开心地宣布："第三适格者又打架了。"

"What?" Misato sat upright, looking for her male ward, "Shinji get over here. Let me have a look." Repressing the urge to sigh, the boy obeyed and soon stood before Misato, his chin lifted so she could get a clear look at his face. Taking the boy's chin in her hand, the motherly woman turned his head this way and that, searching for any less obvious wounds.  
""什么？" 美里立刻坐直，寻找她的男室友，"真嗣，过来一下，让我看看。" 压抑住叹气的冲动，男孩顺从地走了过去，抬起下巴以便美里能清楚地看到他的脸。美里用手托住真嗣的下巴，左右转动他的头，仔细寻找那些不那么明显的伤口。

Bringing her face close to his, she examined the large cut on the boy's lower lip and the split skin above his left eyebrow. Satisfied that he'd suffered only minor injury, Misato shook her head. "Going by the condition of your uniform, I'm willing to bet you didn't fight back again."  
她将脸贴近他的，仔细检查了男孩下唇上的大伤口和左眉上裂开的皮肤。确认他只受了些轻伤后，美里摇了摇头。"看你制服的状况，我敢打赌你又没还手。

Looking down, Shinji realized that he looked a mess. His white oxford shirt was smudged with dirt and blood, missing several buttons near the collar, and wrinkled from where Kazuo had gotten hold of it. He wondered how bad his face looked.  
低头一看，真嗣意识到自己看起来一团糟。他的白色牛津衬衫上沾满了泥土和血迹，领口附近掉了几颗扣子，还被和夫抓过的地方皱巴巴的。他不禁好奇自己的脸看起来有多糟糕。

The boy nodded, prompting another sigh to escape his guardian's lips. "Shinji, you need to stand up for yourself. You can't just let people do whatever they want to you." They'd had this conversation several times, but it never seemed to make any difference.  
男孩点了点头，引得监护人又叹了口气。“真嗣，你得为自己站出来。不能任由别人对你为所欲为。”他们已经有过好几次这样的对话，但似乎从未产生任何改变。

The boy couldn't meet the woman's eyes, "I'm sorry Misato." The same hollow response he'd given so many times before. 'It always comes to this,' the boy thought to himself, 'I haven't changed at all.'  
"男孩无法直视那位女士的眼睛，“对不起，美里。”他以前已经无数次给出过同样的空洞回应。‘总是这样，’男孩暗自思忖，‘我一点也没变。’”

Seeing the gloom hanging around the boy, Misato rubbed the bridge of her nose. "It's ok Shinji, you didn't do anything wrong. Just…just go get washed up and changed." Giving an almost imperceptible nod, the boy solemnly turned away and made his way to the bathroom, the door clicking shut behind him.  
看到男孩周围笼罩的阴霾，葛城美里揉了揉鼻梁。“没事的，真嗣，你没做错什么。只是……去洗个澡，换身衣服吧。”男孩几乎不易察觉地点了点头，神情肃穆地转身走向浴室，门在他身后轻轻关上。

Settling back on the couch, the raven haired woman sighed to herself. "Oh, Shinji…"  
葛城美里靠回沙发上，自顾自地叹了口气。“哦，真嗣……”

---

Standing before the immaculate white porcelain of the sink, Shinji looked into the small bathroom mirror, seeing the extent of the damage for the first time. The boy didn't think it was as bad as his family was making out. Family…. The boy smiled lightly at the thought.  
站在洁白无瑕的洗手池前，真嗣望向狭小浴室里的镜子，第一次看清了自己的伤势。他并不觉得这有家人所说的那么严重。家人……想到这里，男孩微微一笑。

His lower lip was marked with a long, vertical, black line of drying blood from where the first strike had landed. Above his left eye, a similar gash, this one horizontal, left a long trail of drying blood down his face. The blood covered a large amount of the boy's face, almost acting as a strange half mask.  
他的下唇上有一条长长的垂直黑线，那是干涸的血迹，来自第一击落下的地方。在他的左眼上方，有一道类似的横切伤口，留下了一条长长的干血迹沿着他的脸颊流下。血迹覆盖了男孩脸部的大部分，几乎像是一种奇怪的半面具。

Exploring the wounds with his fingers, the boy winced as a sharp sting greeted his probing. All in all, it wasn't so bad. He might not even need stitches for the injuries. The cut next to his eyebrow definitely had the possibility of leaving a scar, though.  
用手指探索着伤口，男孩因尖锐的刺痛而皱眉。总的来说，情况并不算太糟。他可能甚至不需要缝合这些伤口。靠近眉毛的那道切口确实有可能留下疤痕。

Turning the sink handle, the boy cupped his hands and carefully splashed the cool water on his face. Hissing as the water bit at the still open wounds, Shinji did his best to rub away the sticky fluid. Reaching for a towel to clean himself, the Third Child found the rack empty.  
转动水龙头，男孩双手捧起，小心翼翼地将凉水泼在脸上。当水触及仍未愈合的伤口时，他倒吸一口凉气，尽力擦去粘稠的液体。伸手去拿毛巾清洁自己，第三适格者发现架子空空如也。

Quickly counting the days his head, he realized that laundry needed to be done. In a very rare occurrence, Misato had apparently done her share of the workload. Of course, the woman being helpful still managed to inconvenience the boy. It seemed that fate made it difficult for him to get through even small matters  
他快速地数着日子，意识到需要洗衣服了。难得一见的是，明日香似乎已经完成了她那份工作。当然，这位女士的帮忙仍旧给男孩带来了不便。命运似乎总是让他连小事都难以顺利解决。

The click of the door opening surprised him, Asuka entering the room even more so. Confusion tugged at his mind, as the redhead made her way to him. "Asuka what're-?"  
门被打开的声音让他吃了一惊，更让他惊讶的是，明日香走进了房间。他的脑海中充满了困惑，因为这位红发少女正朝他走来。“明日香，你这是……？”

Cut off as the girl gruffly took his chin in her hand, the boy began to protest when she spoke. "My God, Third Child, you really can't take care of yourself at all, can you?" His chin still firmly in her grasp, the boy was unable to look away from the girl's smirking face. God, she was pretty.  
话还没说完，女孩便粗鲁地用手托住他的下巴，当他开始抗议时，她开口了。“天哪，第三适格者，你真的完全不会照顾自己，对吧？”他的下巴仍被她紧紧握着，男孩无法从女孩那带着嘲讽的脸上移开视线。天啊，她真美。

The boy stumbled backwards as his roommate gave his face a quick shove. Falling harshly on the toilet, Shinji's heart leapt to his throat as his pretty assailant crouched down to meet his gaze. Feeling his face slowly heating up from Asuka's close gaze, the Third Child made the attempt to look away. For reason's he couldn't quite understand, he didn't want Asuka to see the rosy tint his cheeks had taken. It wasn't something she hadn't seen before, so why did he care?  
男孩踉跄后退，室友迅速推了他的脸一把。重重地摔在马桶上，真嗣的心跳到了嗓子眼，只见那位漂亮的袭击者蹲下身来与他对视。感受到明日香近距离的目光，第三适格者试图移开视线。不知为何，他不想让明日香看到自己脸颊上的红晕。这并非她未曾见过的，那他为何在意呢？

Taking the boy's chin in hand again, Asuka produced a thin, white towel. Careful to avoid reopening the cuts or causing the boy an unnecessary pain, she wiped at the blood covering Shinji's face. "Misato told me to bring you a towel. But, knowing you, you'd probably screw this up too, so keep still."  
再次用手托起男孩的下巴，明日香拿出一条薄薄的白色毛巾。小心翼翼地避免重新撕裂伤口或给男孩带来不必要的痛苦，她擦拭着覆盖在真嗣脸上的血迹。“美里让我给你带条毛巾。但我知道你，你大概也会搞砸，所以别动。”

Forcing to keep his head straight forward, Shinji did his best to avoid looking at the girl before him. His eyes refusing to obey his commands, the boy slowly locked his gaze on the Second Child's face. An impassive mask met him. Whatever Asuka felt at that moment, he couldn't tell.  
强迫自己直视前方，真嗣尽力不去看面前的女孩。他的眼睛不听使唤，男孩的目光渐渐锁定在第二适格者的脸上。迎接他的是一副无动于衷的面具。那一刻明日香有何感受，他无从得知。

Wiping away the blood staining the boy's face, the redhead rubbed Shinji's face with care that bordered on affection. Swallowing hard, the Third Child did his best to convince himself that he was wrong. It didn't take.  
擦去男孩脸上的血迹，红发少女温柔地摩挲着真嗣的脸颊，那动作近乎爱抚。真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，尽力说服自己误会了。但无济于事。

The tender caress of the damp towel, the heart stopping beauty of his roommate's delicate face, the strange positions the two were in. Heart hammering in his chest, Shinji felt the reality of the situation set in. Asuka sitting before him, gently stroking his face, not screaming about how moronic he was.  
湿毛巾温柔的触感，室友精致面容令人窒息的美，两人所处的奇异姿势。心脏在胸腔中狂跳，真嗣感到现实情况逐渐清晰。明日香坐在他面前，轻抚他的脸庞，没有尖叫着指责他的愚蠢。

He'd had dreams like this before. However, in most of them, one of the two parties was significantly more naked.  
他以前做过这样的梦。不过，在大多数梦中，两人中至少有一方要裸露得多。

Taken aback at the turn his thoughts had taken, the Third Child quickly averted his gaze once more. Desperate for something besides the immoral fantasies to occupy his attention, he cleared his throat. "H-hey, Asuka," the boy began, knowing that he would regret the next words that came from his mouth, "you d-don't have t-to d-do this."  
被自己的思绪所惊，第三适格者迅速再次移开目光。他迫切需要除了那些不道德的幻想之外的东西来占据注意力，于是清了清嗓子。“嘿，明日香，”男孩开口说道，知道自己会后悔接下来要说的话，“你，你不必这么做。”

"I- I know," Asuka began, sounding like a small child admitting to something she shouldn't have done, "B-but I w-want to."  
“我，我知道，”明日香开口，听起来像是一个承认做了不该做的事情的小孩，“但，但我想要这么做。”

No, wait. That wasn't right.  
不，等等。那不对。

Asuka's face hardened into a scowl. "Fine then, Third Child," she began, her voice sharp enough to cut glass, "Take care of it yourself!" Flinging the towel into Shinji's face, the angered redhead turned on her heel and stomped out of the bathroom.  
明日香的表情变得冷硬，眉头紧锁。“好吧，第三适格者，”她开口说道，声音尖锐得仿佛能切开玻璃，“你自己搞定吧！”她将毛巾甩到真嗣脸上，愤怒的红发少女转身跺着脚走出了浴室。

The towel fell into his lap and Shinji blinked several times. What just happened? Asuka had had two completely different reactions. Looking at the towel resting on his legs, the boy shook his head. Maybe the head wounds he sustained were worse than he'd thought.  
毛巾落在了他的腿上，真嗣眨了几下眼睛。刚才发生了什么？明日香的态度完全变了两次。看着腿上的毛巾，少年摇了摇头。也许他头部受的伤比他想象的还要严重。

Cleaning up the last of the blood himself, Shinji changed into more casual clothes and rested in his room. Staring up at the ceiling, the Third Child slowly felt the fog of sleep slowly creep in on his mind. His eyes closed and his mind drifted of to sleep.  
自己清理完最后一点血迹后，真嗣换上更休闲的衣服，回到自己的房间休息。仰望着天花板，第三适格者渐渐感觉到睡意如雾般悄悄侵入他的意识。他的眼睛闭上，思绪飘向了梦乡。

_11:22 pm 晚上 11 点 22 分_

Eyes snapping open, Shinji awoke with his ears ringing horribly, his head pounding. The calm of the night split as a high pitch shriek tore across the sky. The sound originated in nightmares, the bad places of a man's mind. A sound of terror and agony and rage that sounded vaguely human. A surging of voices scrambling for dominance: men, women, children, elderly, the unborn. A storm of collected anguish and fear that would not go unheard. Something was screaming.  
真嗣猛地睁开眼睛，耳边嗡嗡作响，头痛欲裂。夜的宁静被一声尖锐的尖叫撕裂，划破天际。那声音源自噩梦，来自人心深处的黑暗角落。那是恐惧、痛苦与愤怒交织的哀嚎，隐约带着人类的气息。无数声音在争抢主导权：男人、女人、孩童、老人，甚至未出生的婴儿。这是一场汇聚了痛苦与恐惧的风暴，无法被忽视。有什么东西在尖叫。

Something was screaming and Shinji Ikari could hear it.  
有什么东西在尖叫，而碇真嗣能听见它。

Stumbling to his window, the boy was taken aback at the light pouring in. It was far too late for that much light. Forcing himself to look, the Third Child felt his stomach drop as he saw the bright red cross burning in the distance.  
跌跌撞撞地走到窗前，男孩被倾泻进来的光线惊呆了。这么晚不该有这么强烈的光。他强迫自己看去，当看到远处燃烧的鲜红十字时，第三适格者感到胃里一阵下沉。
