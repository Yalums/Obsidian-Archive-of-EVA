This is my first fic, so please excuse any newbie errors or such! I've decided that I would publish it as a whole, complete fic, rather than chapter by chapter, mainly just to prove to myself I could do it.

这是我的第一篇小说，所以请原谅任何新手错误或类似问题！我决定将其作为完整的小说发布，而不是按章节发布，主要是为了向自己证明我能做到。

## Chapter 1 Transparency

When I think of Asuka and those far off days my two most abiding memories are the smell of Strawberry Balsam Shampoo, and her standing silhouetted against the harsh blue sky. Her yellow sundress billowing, almost transparent as the thin material flapped around her body. That and the fiery corona created around her tousled Golden-Red Hair by the late morning sunlight framing her face. She cocked her head at me quizzically from the small cairn of stones that she stood astride like a colossus.

每当我想起明日香和那些遥远的时光，最深刻的记忆便是草莓香波的气味，以及她站在刺眼的蓝天下的剪影。她身着黄色太阳裙，裙摆飘扬，薄薄的布料几乎透明，随风轻拂她的身体。还有那清晨阳光在她凌乱的金红色发丝周围形成的炽热光环，映衬着她的面庞。她站在小石堆上，宛如巨人，歪着头好奇地看着我。

When people talk of the Second Child and the Angel Wars these days you'd think that she was more of a monster than the Fourteenth Angel. A one girl tsunami of chaos and destructive power. Terrible, violent and spiteful with almost no hope of redemption possible.

如今人们谈及第二适格者与天使战争时，你会觉得她比第十四使徒更像怪物。她是一股混乱与破坏力的单人海啸，可怕、暴力且充满恶意，几乎看不到任何救赎的可能。

Of course, they didn't have to live with her.

当然，他们不必与她同住。

Not like I did. 不像我那样。

I could have told them far more harrowing a story than their closeted pre-Impact minds could have even imagined. The screaming, the throwing of random pieces of cutlery, the casual violence and taunting. The constant accusations of lust and perversion. Oh no, they didn't know the half of it.

我本可以向他们讲述一个远比他们封闭的、冲击前的心灵所能想象的更为惊心动魄的故事。那尖叫声，随意抛掷的餐具碎片，漫不经心的暴力与嘲弄。对欲望和堕落的无休止指控。哦不，他们连一半的真相都不曾知晓。

And yet there was far more to the story than that mere childish caricature. She was capable of; well I guess you could call it kindness, even if it was kindness with a barb to it. Living with Asuka Langley Soryu back then was like walking on a glass bridge over a pit of scorpions. You could never be sure when the whole thing would shatter and you would fall into the scorpions den, with the stinging and the hurting and the screaming and such and such.

然而，这个故事远不止那幼稚的讽刺画那么简单。她也有能力展现出——好吧，我猜你可以称之为带有刺的善意。那时与惣流·明日香·兰格雷同住，就像行走在玻璃桥上，桥下是满坑的蝎子。你永远无法确定何时整座桥会碎裂，让你坠入蝎子窝，伴随着刺痛、伤害、尖叫等等。

Hmm… I suck at metaphors.

嗯……我不擅长比喻。

Despite all of this, I cherished those quieter, 'kinder' moments more than all the Pickled Soy-Curd in New Shanghai, as the old saying goes.

尽管如此，我更珍视那些更安静、更温和的时刻，胜过新上海所有的腐乳，正如老话所说。

But I digress. 但我跑题了。

This particular day had started with lies and subterfuge. Nothing biblical mind you. I had been up for over an hour that morning before either of my fellow residents of the Katsuragi, um… residence, had even stirred. It's just the way things were there in those days. I often think that I was more like a mother to that household than anything else. Although the topic of Mothers is not one that should be broached casually, even in these more enlightened days.

那天一早便充斥着谎言与诡计，当然，并非什么圣经故事。那天早上，在我那两位同住 Katsuragi 家的室友醒来前，我已经起床超过一个小时了。那段日子里，事情就是这样。我常觉得自己更像是那个家的母亲，而非其他角色。尽管“母亲”这个话题不宜轻率提及，即使在如今这个开明的时代。

Anyway, I was up first, as usual. Pen-Pen was fed and beered and had waddled back to his fridge as contented a Hot Springs Penguin as ever there was. As for me, well I was cooking breakfast. Turkey-Bacon and eggs for Asuka, a Chicken Okayu with Yebisu chaser for Misato and toast and marmalade for myself. Nothing out of the ordinary there then. Poor unsuspecting sap that I was.

不管怎样，我像往常一样起得最早。Pen-Pen 已经吃饱喝足，心满意足地摇摆着回到了他的冰箱，真是一只再满足不过的温泉企鹅了。至于我，正在做早餐。给明日香准备火鸡培根和鸡蛋，给美里做鸡肉粥配惠比寿啤酒，我自己则是吐司配果酱。一切如常，当时的我真是毫无戒心。

The first actual suspicion that I had of things to come was a shadow across the light streaming in from the open balcony window. That and the sweet fragrance of Strawberry Balsam. I turned quickly around and was face to pretty face with one Asuka Langley Soryu, her nose no more than two or three inches from my own.

我最初对即将发生的事情产生实际怀疑的迹象，是一道阴影掠过从敞开的阳台窗户透进来的光线。还有那草莓香脂的甜美香气。我迅速转过身，与朝比奈兰格蕾·索蕾面对面，她的鼻子离我的不过两三英寸。

"Asuka?" I said shakily, my voice breaking mid syllable. I was a teenaged boy after all. Girls were alluring and terrifying. Asuka exponentially so.

"明日香？" 我颤抖着说，声音在半音节处破裂。毕竟，我只是一个青春期的男孩。女孩们既迷人又可怕。明日香更是如此，成倍地。

"Hey, Shinji-kun." She purred. "Wanna see something cool?"

嘿，真嗣君。" 她柔声说道，"想看点酷炫的东西吗？

I was trapped, transfixed by those vivid blue irises and that intoxicating scent. Not to mention that the girl that I both feared and longed after was within a few short inches of me. And calling me Shinji-kun! Blood rushed from my brain and to, well the less said about where it rushed to the better, all I knew for sure was that if she noticed, I was a dead man…er… boy. Once again may I state for the record that I was a teenager.

我被困住了，被那双生动的蓝眼睛和那令人陶醉的香气迷住了。更不用说，那个我既害怕又渴望的女孩离我只有几英寸远。而且她还叫我真嗣君！血液从我的大脑涌向，嗯，涌向哪里就不多说了，我只知道如果她注意到了，我就死定了……呃……男孩。再次声明，我当时是个青少年。

"Ummm, sure Asuka." 嗯，当然，明日香。

"Cool." She said, her morning breath wafting gently over me as she took the plate of turkey bacon and eggs that I held out for her, though she still stayed terrifyingly close to me. "Act like nothing is going on." She whispered, theatrically sotto voce. "When Misato finally emerges tell her that we're going to school as usual."

真不错。" 她说着，晨间的口气轻轻拂过我，同时接过我递给她的火鸡培根和鸡蛋盘子，尽管她依然令人害怕地紧贴着我。"表现得好像什么都没发生。" 她低声耳语，戏剧性地压低了声音。"等美里终于出来时，告诉她我们像往常一样去上学。

"Uh, okay." I said, feeling denser than Berkelium at this point. We weren't going to school as usual? I thought.

"呃，好吧。" 我说道，感觉自己此刻比铍还要迟钝。我们今天不去上学了吗？我暗自思忖。

Finally she turned and took her breakfast off to the kitchen table.

最终，她转身将早餐端到了厨房的餐桌上。

You probably won't mind if I skip over the next hour or so. Needless to relate it involved lying to Misato, with Asuka alternately winking and glaring at me, and me alternating between blushing tumescence and abject terror. Not that there was anything particularly unusual about that for me in those days. This was followed by a lengthy henpecked hike up into the foothills to the North West of Old Hakone.

你大概不会介意我省略接下来的一小时左右。无需赘述，那包括了对美里撒谎，明日香时而眨眼时而怒视我，而我则在脸红心跳与极度恐惧之间徘徊。那段日子里，对我来说这并不算特别异常。之后，我们又经历了一段被唠叨的漫长徒步，向着老箱根西北方的丘陵地带进发。

This brings me back to where we came into this. You know, Asuka standing proudly atop a convenient cairn. Me staring up at her admiring the way the sunlight shone through her hair and trying very hard not to give away the fact that I could see through her dress.

这让我回想起了我们初来乍到时的情景。记得吗，明日香骄傲地站在一个便利的石堆上。我仰望着她，欣赏阳光透过她的发丝，同时努力掩饰我能透过她的裙子看到的一切。

"Come on, Dunderhead!" She sniped at me. "Stop your lagging behind. We're nearly there!"

“快点，笨蛋！”她冲我嚷道，“别拖后腿了，我们快到了！”

"You know, I could probably walk a lot faster if you carried your own pack Asuka!"

你知道吗，如果你自己背背包，我可能走得快多了，明日香！

"Humph! Maybe they're right when they say that chivalry is dead in post 2nd Impact Japan! What bold and courtly knight of old would even consider letting his lady bear such a burden whilst he had even an ounce of strength?"

哼！或许他们说得对，后第二次冲击时代的日本，骑士精神已荡然无存！昔日那些勇敢而彬彬有礼的骑士，哪会容许自己的女士承受如此重负，而自己哪怕还有一丝力气？

"Whatever." I muttered. I knew I couldn't win. I comforted myself with the image of Asuka in days of yore, locked in a tower guarded by a fearsome dragon. I smiled dreamily to myself. A Red Dragon with fearsome teeth and bright blue eyes and two red neural connector-horns on its head. Of course, if Asuka was the Dragon, that would make the Damsel in Distress trapped up in the Tower… Me. Hmmm… I shook my head. I had enough issues of my own without going down that rocky path.

"随便吧。"我嘟囔着。我知道自己赢不了。我安慰自己，想象着昔日阿苏卡被囚禁在高塔中，由一头可怕的龙守护的画面。我梦幻般地笑了。那是一头红龙，有着可怕的牙齿和明亮的蓝眼睛，头上还有两个红色的神经连接角。当然，如果阿苏卡是那条龙，那么被困在塔顶的落难少女……就是我了。嗯……我摇了摇头。我自己已经够麻烦了，没必要再走那条坎坷的路。

"I knew that you'd see it my way." She beamed. "Now stop trying to see through my dress and let's get moving!"

她笑着说：“我就知道你会认同我的看法。现在别再盯着我的裙子看了，我们快走吧！”

"I…. I wasn't t-trying to… "I stuttered, blushing guiltily.

“我……我并不是故意要……”我结结巴巴地说，内疚地脸红了。

She stepped down from the cairn and started walking along next to me as we made our careful way through the debris field that this area had become after the destruction of the Seventh Angel several months ago.

她从石冢上下来，开始与我并肩而行，我们小心翼翼地穿过这片区域，几个月前第七使徒被摧毁后，这里已变成了一片废墟。

"Don't act all innocent with me Third Child!" She said. "I know that you spend all of your day lusting after my perky young body!"

"别在我面前装无辜，三娃！" 她说道，"我知道你整天都在觊觎我这年轻有活力的身体！"

"A-Asuka I…" I attempted to deny it, even though it was reasonably true in those days.

"A-Asuka 我…" 我试图否认，尽管在当时这确实是事实。

"Don't even try to deny it, Hentai!" She said imperiously. "I've seen you leering at me at school! Not to mention the unspeakable things you probably with my panties on wash day!"

别想否认，变态！" 她傲慢地说。"我在学校看到你色眯眯地盯着我！更别提你大概在洗衣日对我的内裤做的那些难以启齿的事了！

"I-I…" 我…我…

"And what do you do, spending so much time in the bathroom every night anyway?"

那你每晚在浴室里花那么多时间，到底在做什么呢？

"W-what do you mean?" I asked in confusion.

"You know very well, Third! You think that I don't notice when you go off to the bathroom for your 'Special Shinji Alone Time'? It gets downright awkward for Misato and me trying to make polite small talk with the sounds of heavy breathing and rhythmic pounding echoing right throughout the apartment!"

你很清楚，真嗣！你以为我注意不到你溜去卫生间进行你的‘特别真嗣独处时光’吗？你那沉重的呼吸声和有节奏的敲击声在整个公寓回响，让美里和我试图礼貌地闲聊时都感到非常尴尬！

"That's really unfair!" I could feel the heat in my face growing.

"这真的很不公平！"我能感觉到我的脸颊在发热。

"Oh Shinji! Just admit that you're a compulsive Onanist and let's end this hollow charade!"

哦，真嗣！就承认你是个强迫性的手淫者吧，让我们结束这场空洞的伪装！

Onanist? I thought. But my old Teacher didn't really hold with organised religion.

自慰者？我暗想。但我那位老教师其实并不真正支持有组织的宗教。

Asuka could see my puzzled expression. What followed was a graphically mimed explanation that still haunts my nightmares to this very day.

明日香能看出我困惑的表情。接下来的是一场形象生动的哑剧解释，至今仍在我噩梦中挥之不去。

"Oh." Was all that I said.

“哦。”我仅此一言。

"Yep, that's what we usually hear right before you finish!"

是的，这就是我们通常在你完成之前听到的！

"ASUKA!" Beetroot had nothing on me at that moment.

"ASUKA!"那一刻，甜菜根根本比不上我。

"Hahahahahaha!" She laughed uproariously at my discomfiture. "You are too easy to wind up Third! Ah ha ha…" She wiped a tear from her eye and leaned a hand on my shoulder as we walked through the rubble. "Promise me you'll never change, Shinji!"

"哈哈哈哈哈！" 她看到我的窘态，放声大笑。"你太容易被逗了，三号！啊哈哈哈……" 她擦了擦眼角的泪水，一手搭在我的肩上，我们一同穿行在废墟之中。"答应我，你永远不要改变，真嗣！"

There. There it was. Let's just take a brief pause in the narrative to take in this scene to its fullest.

那里，它就在那里。让我们在叙述中稍作停顿，充分感受这一场景。

Asuka: Smiling happily. Her left hand casually draped over my shoulder. Her hand was so light and soft, but its merest touch sent an electric wave through my whole body.

明日香：幸福地微笑着。她的左手随意地搭在我的肩上。她的手如此轻盈柔软，但仅仅一触，便让我全身如遭电击。

Me: I was as close as I ever was to dissolving into pure LCL at that moment.

那一刻，我几乎要化作纯粹的 LCL，这是我从未有过的接近。

Mmmmmm….. Foreshadowing… 嗯……预示着……

It may sound pathetic to you but there it was. The rare moment of interpersonal tenderness that froze time and made my adolescent heart skip a proverbial beat. Here we were together, she was happy in my company. I was scared/happy and strangely emboldened by the heady thrill of sharing company with this beautiful, exotic and terrifying creature who was actually touching me. Voluntarily.

这对你来说或许听起来很可悲，但那一刻确实存在。那罕见的瞬间人际温情，凝固了时间，让我的青春期心跳漏了一拍。我们在一起，她在我身边感到快乐。我既害怕又高兴，与这位美丽、异国情调且令人畏惧的生物共享陪伴的兴奋感让我莫名勇敢起来，而她竟然在主动触碰我。

"Well… "I said before my internal censor could wrestle my newfound confidence to the floor and kneel on its windpipe. "A boy has to have a hobby…"

嗯……我赶在内心的审查机制将我新获得的自信按倒在地并扼住其喉咙之前说道：“男孩子总得有个爱好……”

Instantly my heart quailed in terror, Too Much? As Asuka's hand lifted from my shoulder momentarily. I silently cursed at my self-sabotaging ability once again rearing its head. I screwed up my eyes and bowed my head. Idiot! I thought to myself. Stupid stupid stupid!

我的心瞬间因恐惧而颤抖，太过分了吗？当明日香的手从我肩上短暂移开时。我默默地再次诅咒自己那自我破坏的能力又抬头了。我紧闭双眼，低下头。白痴！我暗自想道。愚蠢至极！

Thwack! Asuka's hand regained contact with me by way of a smack to the back of the head. That wasn't surprising. What did take me by surprise was the lack of force behind the blow.

啪！明日香的手通过一记拍在后脑勺的巴掌重新与我接触。这并不令人惊讶。真正让我意外的是那一击中缺乏的力量。

"Hentai.." She said softly, a slight but unmistakeable blush on her cheeks as she turned her face away.

"变态……" 她轻声说道，脸上泛起一丝难以掩饰的红晕，随即转过脸去。

We trudged on in silence for a few minutes longer. My confused mind casting desperately around for a way to ease the awkwardness that I felt had overtaken our trek.

我们又默默地走了几分钟。我那混乱的思绪拼命寻找着缓解这种尴尬气氛的方法，我感觉它已经笼罩了我们的旅程。

"Asuka, I… "I tried to begin.

"明日香，我……" 我试图开口。

"Quiet!" The redheaded girl said impatiently. "I think we're nearly there!"

"安静！"红发女孩不耐烦地说，"我想我们快到了！"

"There?" 那里？

"Shh!" 嘘！

We finally came to a stop at the lip of an enormous crater in the side of the hill.

我们最终在山坡上一个巨大陨石坑的边缘停了下来。

"Well, Third. Here we are! What do you think?"

嗯，第三。我们到了！你觉得怎么样？

I knew this place. "Ummm… "

我认得这个地方。“嗯……”

"Exactly! The scene of my greatest triumph!"

正是如此！我最辉煌胜利的场景！

"The Seventh Angel?" I said in confusion. "But we both defeated that Angel with a perfectly synchronised attack!"

"第七位天使？" 我困惑地说，"但我们俩不是已经用完美同步的攻击打败了那个天使吗！"

"Puh-lease!" She said disparagingly. "All of that 'Jazz Hands' dancey crap? If you'll remember correctly I was the one that executed that attack perfectly. While all you managed to do was fall on your ass and make us both look stupid!"

"拜托了！"她轻蔑地说，"那些所谓的'爵士手'舞蹈垃圾？如果你记得没错，正是那个人完美地执行了那次攻击。而你呢，只是摔了个屁股墩，让我们俩都显得很蠢！"

"I…" I give up… I gave up.

“我……”我放弃了……我放弃了。

I decided on a different tack. "So, we skipped school today, marched miles out of town, to look at a big hole in the ground?"

我决定换个策略：“所以，我们今天逃学了，走了好几英里出城，就为了看一个大坑？”

This seemed to have been the wrong thing to say.

这似乎说错了话。

"So, Third Child. I go to the trouble of getting us out of the most boring school in the Developed World. I get your pasty ass out into the Great Outdoors before the Rickets finally takes you. And, not to mention, give you some money can't buy one on one time with the Great Asuka Langley Soryu, and all you do is whine at me about the scenery?"

所以，第三适格者。我费尽心思把我们从发达国家最无聊的学校里弄出来。我把你那苍白的屁股拖到大自然中去，免得佝偻病最终把你击垮。更不用说，还给了你一些金钱买不到的与伟大的明日香·兰格雷一对一的时光，而你却只知道对我抱怨风景？

"I… uh… Asuka… I'm sorr…"

我…呃…明日香…对不起…

"Don't, Third. Just don't even go there!"

别，老三。连想都别想！

My mouth worked up and down for a few moments before finally giving up. "So why are we here, Asuka?"

我的嘴巴上下动了好一会儿，最终还是放弃了。“那我们到底为什么在这里，明日香？”

She grinned at me. "I told you, Shinji. It's a surprise! Now come on! Let's find us a way down there!"

她朝我咧嘴一笑：“我告诉过你，真嗣，这是个惊喜！快来吧！我们得找条路下去！”

All questions of why and how evaporated from my tiny mind. Asuka called me Shinji! Again! The tiny and I'll admit rather pathetic thrill that sent down what passed for my spine in those days was enough that I would follow Asuka into the gates of Hell without question.

所有关于为何与如何的疑问从我渺小的心灵中消散。明日香再次叫我真嗣！那一刻，尽管微小且我承认颇为可怜的激动感，沿着当时我那所谓的脊梁骨传遍全身，足以让我毫不犹豫地跟随明日香踏入地狱之门。

Some things, it seems, never change.

有些事情，似乎永远不会改变。

## Chapter 2 Inversion

Bah! Why I put up with some people never ceases to puzzle me. You know who I mean, Third!

哎！我怎么忍受某些人，这始终让我困惑不已。你知道我说的是谁，第三！

So, I've found Shinji's little essay about that day in Old New Tokyo-3, and frankly, I think a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters may not necessarily have done better, but probably would have managed to hold my interest for slightly longer.

所以，我找到了真嗣关于那天在旧新东京-3 的小论文，坦白说，我觉得一千只猴子在一千台打字机上工作未必能做得更好，但可能会让我的兴趣稍微持久一些。

Here he is talking about a day upon which I took my own personal time to liven up his humdrum little life, and all he does is whine about it and make several, not so subtle, references to his nether regions.

他在这里谈论的是我抽出自己的私人时间来活跃他那乏味的小生活的一天，而他所做的只是抱怨，并多次不那么隐晦地提及他的下体。

Hentai. 变态。

Actually, I was a good person back then. Better than he deserved, some might say. I put up with his insignificant existence didn't I? Not to mention Misato's crapulous behaviour. And, on the day in question I was actually doing him a favour and being nice to him. It was kind of like a Community Service.

实际上，我那时是个好人。比他应得的还要好，有人可能会这么说。我忍受了他那微不足道的存在，不是吗？更别提美里那令人作呕的行为了。而且，在那天，我其实是在帮他一个忙，对他很友好。这有点像社区服务。

Ingrate. 忘恩负义。

Meh. 一般般。

Anyway, why don't I carry on this story for the time being?

不管怎样，我暂时继续讲这个故事如何？

So actually, I will admit, I really didn't have anything 'cool' to show Shinji that day. I was just BORED out of my brain at that stupid school. I had a College degree for fuck's sake! Sure it was a Liberal Arts degree from Schweinfurt Polytechnic, but still, it was more than any of my fellow drones in that classroom had. Including that fossilised old Sensei.

实际上，我得承认，那天我真的没有什么“酷炫”的东西可以展示给真嗣看。在那所愚蠢的学校里，我无聊得要命。我可是有大学学位的人啊！虽然是从施韦因富特理工学院拿的文科学位，但毕竟比教室里那些庸碌之辈强多了，包括那位老古董老师。

I needed to get out of that God-awful stifling city, and checking out the site of one of my early victories seemed as good an idea as any at that time. Hiking had been something that I had always enjoyed in Germany. So, I thought, why the Hell not? It might tell you a little about how boring a company town like Tokyo-3 could actually get that a hole in the ground seemed like a viable option for a day's outing.

我需要逃离那个令人窒息的可怕城市，回顾我早期胜利的地点似乎是个不错的主意。徒步旅行在德国时一直是我所喜爱的。所以我想，为什么不呢？这或许能让你了解到像东京-3 这样的公司城镇有多无聊，以至于一个地洞都成了当天出游的可行选择。

And also, the truth be told, Shinji was actually quite pleasant company in those days. Apart from his endless whining and apologising. Not to mention the lust and perversion that is endemic to all males that age. All of that aside, Shinji was actually ok.

说实话，真嗣在那段时间其实是个相当不错的伙伴。除了他无休止的抱怨和道歉。更不用说那个年龄段所有男性普遍存在的欲望和堕落。撇开这些不谈，真嗣其实还不错。

It didn't do to let him know that though.

不过，还是不要让他知道这一点为好。

But enough of that… 但这些就不多说了……

Finding a way further down into the crater proved almost impossible, so eventually I spotted a likely place to stop on the crater's edge across on the other side. Leading the way, with Shinji still whining about carrying both of the packs, we began our trek around it.

找到通往火山口更深处的方法几乎是不可能的，最终我在对面边缘发现了一个看似合适的停留点。我带头前行，而真嗣仍在抱怨要背负两个背包，我们开始绕行火山口。

"Asuka, why are we doing this?" Shinji asked me, gingerly stepping amongst the scree and rubble.

"明日香，我们为什么要这么做？" 真嗣小心翼翼地踩在碎石和瓦砾之间问道。

"I told you, to see something cool!"

我告诉过你，去看些酷的东西！

"You said that, but… "

你是这么说的，但是…

"Don't you dare spoil this with your nit-pickery Third Child! Anyway, we're almost there!"

你敢用你的吹毛求疵来破坏这个试试，第三适格者！不管怎样，我们快到了！

Shinji, displaying rare common sense, kept quiet.

真嗣难得表现出常识，保持了沉默。

We finally arrived at the spot on the edge of the crater. The blasted remains of an old tree providing a semblance of shade. The crater sloped down and away from us like the caldera of an enormous volcano. The rocky surface of the sloping sides gave way to what looked like a smooth perfect circle in its centre. The rock there had almost a glassy look to it, possibly, I guess, from the heat of the Angel's exploding core.

我们终于抵达了火山口边缘的地点。一棵老树的残骸提供了些许阴凉。火山口从我们面前倾斜而下，宛如一个巨大火山的破火山口。斜坡的岩石表面在中心处过渡成一个看似平滑完美的圆形。那里的岩石几乎呈现出玻璃般的光泽，我猜想，可能是天使爆炸核心的高温所致。

We halted. I held my hand out for my back pack, which Shinji handed over. Unzipping it and reaching into it I pulled out a large tartan, rubber backed, picnic rug, and spread it on the ground. I motioned for him to sit. He sat. All the while looking up at me with those big puppy dog eyes of his. I smiled at him. He cringed like a frightened bunny for a moment before smiling back. Weirdly I could feel my heartbeat pounding in my chest like a jackhammer with ADHD.

我们停了下来。我伸手要我的背包，新二递给了我。拉开拉链，伸手进去，我拿出一块大格子图案、背面有橡胶的野餐毯，铺在地上。我示意他坐下。他坐了下来。他一直用那双大狗狗般的眼睛抬头看着我。我对他微笑。他像受惊的小兔子一样畏缩了一会儿，然后回以微笑。奇怪的是，我能感觉到自己的心跳像患有多动症的冲击钻一样在胸腔里砰砰直跳。

Come on, keep it together Soryu!

来吧，坚持住，索龙！

I sat across from him on the rug, still smiling. Reaching into the bag I produced a large thermos filled with hot water. Followed by two polystyrene containers of a generic brand cup noodle I had stolen from Misato's personal stash. I peeled the lids partly off, poured the hot water into the containers and handed one to him.

我坐在地毯上，对面是他，脸上依旧挂着微笑。我伸手从包里拿出一瓶装满热水的大保温瓶，接着又取出两个通用品牌的杯装方便面，那是从美里私人存货中顺来的。我轻轻揭开盖子，倒入热水，然后将其中一碗递给他。

"Ta da!" "他达！"

"Huh?" Shinji said, appearing to be genuinely confused.

"嗯？" 真嗣说道，显得确实很困惑。

"Well, is this cool, or is this not cool?" I asked, not wishing to show the anxiety I was feeling about how he would answer.

"嗯，这是酷呢，还是不酷呢？" 我问道，不想表露出我对他的回答感到的焦虑。

"Am I missing something?" He said looking a little anxious himself. "You said you going to show me something cool. Um… I-I don't see…"

"我是不是错过了什么？" 他略显焦虑地说道，"你说过要给我看些很酷的东西。呃……我-我怎么没看到……"

Oh, the poor clueless fool. I guess I had to spell it out for him.

哦，那个可怜的无知者。我想我得给他明说了。

"Shinji." I said, putting my serious voice on for the moment. "Think about this for just a second would you? Instead of being trapped in that mind destroying dump of a Middle School you're out here with a beautiful and popular girl. A girl that has not only seen fit to invite your sorry butt out for the day, but who has also provided all of the trappings of a lavish picnic for you! Tell me, is that, or is that not the coolest thing that you have ever seen?" I leaned forward, giving him a perfect and unmissable opportunity to look down the front of my yellow sundress. "Hmm, Shinji-kun?"

"真嗣。" 我严肃地说道，此刻我认真起来。"你能不能花一秒钟想想？与其被困在那所摧毁心灵的中学里，你现在可是和一个既美丽又受欢迎的女孩在一起。这个女孩不仅邀请了你这个可怜的家伙出来玩一天，还为你准备了丰盛的野餐！告诉我，这是不是你见过的最酷的事情？" 我倾身向前，给了他一个绝佳且不容错过的机会，让他可以窥见我黄色太阳裙的领口。"嗯，真嗣君？"

Noting with some degree of satisfaction that Shinji's eyes wandered downward before snapping back to my mine I continued to stare intently at him. 'Come on' I thought, 'say something!'

注意到真嗣的目光先是游移向下，随即又迅速回到我的眼睛上，我继续专注地凝视着他。'快点'，我心想，'说点什么吧！'

"Um… Sorry Asuka." 呃……对不起，明日香。

Say anything but that. 说什么都行，就别说那个。

I 'Hmphed' and sat back on the rug. He really was hopeless. I will admit to more than a little annoyance that all I had achieved for my days efforts so far was to make Shinji sorry and myself cranky. What a waste!

我“哼”了一声，坐回到地毯上。他真是无可救药。我得承认，对于自己一整天的努力只换来了让真嗣感到抱歉和我自己变得暴躁，我感到相当恼火。真是浪费！

We sat in silence for several minutes, the only sound was Shinji slurping at his cup noodles and the wind whistling over the side of the crater, creating small eddies in the dust and causing the remaining boughs of the old tree behind us to creak and sway. Across the crater we could see down the hillside and in the haze the gleaming buildings of Tokyo-3 shone like a crystal palace in the distance.

我们静静地坐了几分钟，唯一的声音是真嗣吸食杯面和风在火山口边缘呼啸而过，在尘土中形成小漩涡，使我们身后那棵老树的残枝发出吱嘎声并摇摆。透过火山口，我们可以看到山坡下，在雾霭中，东京-3 闪闪发光的建筑群在远处宛如一座水晶宫殿。

Shinji lowered his chopsticks and looked at me with a nervous smile.

真嗣放下筷子，带着紧张的微笑看着我。

"You know, Asuka, this is actually kinda cool!"

你知道吗，明日香，这其实挺酷的！

I really wanted to toy with him just a little more, but I couldn't stop the grin that I could feel spreading across my face. Genuine warmth spread from my chest and throughout my whole being

我真的很想再逗他一会儿，但我无法抑制那股从心底蔓延至整个脸庞的笑意。真切的温暖从胸口扩散至全身。

"Told ya, Third! Stick with me, my boy, and you can never go wrong!"

告诉你了，老三！跟着我，我的孩子，你绝不会出错的！

The Third Child's eyes softened and he returned to slurping on his instant cup noodles. I watched him covertly from behind my own polystyrene container. You know, looking at him like that, relaxed, in one of those rare moments when the uncertainty and fear no longer marred his face, he really did have some potential as a bit of a bishonen. Sure, a kinda scrawny and needlessly apologetic one with boring hair, but a bishonen none the less. At those times he radiated a sort of inner calm that I always found comforting. Maybe it was Alpha Waves or Pheromones or some such mumbo-jumbo. Who cares? I would never have admitted it, but those moments, moments like this one, were oddly precious to me in the psycho-existential cluster-fuck that was life in Tokyo-3 in those days.

第三子的眼神柔和下来，又继续吸溜起他的速食杯面。我透过自己的泡沫塑料盒偷偷观察着他。你看，像这样放松地看着他，在那些罕见的时刻，当不确定和恐惧不再扭曲他的面容时，他确实有几分美少年的潜质。当然，是个瘦弱、过分谦逊且发型乏味的美少年，但美少年终究是美少年。那时，他散发出一种内在的平静，我总是觉得安心。或许是阿尔法波，或是费洛蒙之类的玄乎玩意儿。谁在乎呢？我永远不会承认，但那些时刻，就像此刻，在东京-3 那段精神存在主义的混乱生活中，对我来说异常珍贵。

Oh crap, I realised, He's looking back at me! There was no way on Earth I could allow him to think that I, the mighty Asuka Langley Soryu, was gazing dreamily at his scrawny body, with those unexpectedly broad shoulders tapering down to what would be, what with all of the training we did, a toned abdomen and rippling… FOCUS ASUKA! Brain returning to default settings I haughtily 'Hmphed' and stuck my nose in the air and quickly shovelled a large helping of cup noodles out of my container and into my mouth.

糟糕，我突然意识到，他正在回头看我！我绝不能让他以为我，强大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，正痴迷地凝视着他那瘦弱的身躯，那意外宽阔的肩膀向下延伸至经过我们所有训练而变得结实、肌肉线条分明的腹部……集中注意力，明日香！我傲慢地“哼”了一声，把鼻子翘向天空，迅速从我的容器里舀了一大口杯面塞进嘴里。

Big Mistake. 大错特错。

BLEARGH! Gott im Himmel! What the Hell was this crap? Almost immediately I unceremoniously launched the offending noodles and accompanying slurry out of my mouth and back into its cup. Self-preservation winning out over years of etiquette training and natural good grace. I looked at the foam cup, "BEST-EVER BARBEQUE CURRY PORK FLAVOUR!" Proclaimed the overly exuberant Katakana on the side. With an anthropomorphic family of piggies gazing out ravenously at me while clutching forks and knives.

呸！天哪！这是什么鬼东西？我几乎立刻不客气地把那令人不快的面条和伴汤从嘴里吐回杯中。自我保护的本能战胜了多年的礼仪训练和天生的优雅。我看着那泡沫杯，“史上最佳烧烤咖喱猪肉风味！”侧面的片假名夸张地宣称着。一只拟人化的小猪家族正贪婪地盯着我，手里还抓着叉子和刀子。

Barbeque Curry Pork? It tasted like soot, and poo.

烧烤咖喱猪肉？尝起来像煤烟和粪便。

"Asuka? Are you okay?" Shinji asked with what I could tell was genuine concern.

“明日香？你还好吗？”我能感觉到，真嗣的询问充满了真切的关心。

"Of course I'm okay!" I replied blustering, trying to cover up my embarrassment. "Why wouldn't I be okay?"

"我当然没事！"我故作镇定地回答，试图掩饰我的尴尬。"我怎么会不好呢？"

"No reason. It's just that you've got a noodle hanging off your chin."

没什么特别的原因，只是你下巴上挂着一根面条。

I wiped at my chin. I tried to be embarrassed, I tried to be angry. No dice. The ridiculousness of the situation started to get the better of me. It started as a snort, grew into a titter, a chortle, a chuckle even. Before I could help myself I was laughing, guffawing even, as if what had happened was the funniest thing since flatus met elevators.

我擦了擦下巴。我试图感到尴尬，试图生气。但都无济于事。情境的荒谬开始占据上风。起初是哼笑，逐渐变成窃笑，咯咯笑，甚至轻笑。还没来得及自控，我已放声大笑，甚至捧腹大笑，仿佛所发生的事是自屁遇电梯以来最滑稽的一幕。

Shinji initially just smiled at me as I found myself unable to stop laughing. That was until I threw the offending noodle at him of course! It landed deftly on his nose, hanging there until he tried to bat it away, tenaciously it stuck to his fingers as he shook his hand desperately, but vainly, trying to rid himself of it. Soon he was laughing completely unselfconsciously, in fact we both were.

最初，当我发现自己笑得停不下来时，真嗣只是对我微笑。当然，直到我向他扔去那根惹事的面条！它巧妙地落在了他的鼻子上，挂在那里，直到他试图将其拍掉。顽固的面条粘在他的手指上，他拼命地摇手，却徒劳无功。很快，他毫无顾忌地大笑起来，事实上，我们俩都笑得开怀。

Eventually, after several minutes, we calmed down, but I had to admit that at that moment I was definitely feeling what could only be described as a sense of warmth and happiness that was rare in my life at that time. I watched as Shinji finally gave up on the noodle still stuck to his fingers and sucked it off and into his mouth. He grimaced slightly at the flavour.

最终，几分钟后我们平静了下来，但我不得不承认，那一刻我确实感受到了一种罕见的温暖和幸福，这在当时我的生活中是少有的。我看着真嗣最终放弃了手指上粘着的面条，将其吸入口中，他因味道而微微皱眉。

A comfortable silence settled over us as we sat there. His dark blue eyes met mine. He quickly looked away before looking back at me and holding my gaze. The silence grew more profound and decidedly less comfortable. Even the wind had died down. I could feel a trickle of sweat run down into the small of my back as I leaned forward, my left hand within a mere couple of centimetres of his right.

我们坐在那里，一种舒适的沉默笼罩着我们。他深蓝色的眼睛与我对视。他迅速移开视线，然后又看向我，与我目光相持。沉默变得更加深沉，明显不再舒适。连风都停了。我向前倾身，感觉到一滴汗水顺着背脊滑入腰间，我的左手离他的右手仅几厘米之遥。

"Shinji, " I began finally, my mouth suddenly bone dry. "Do-do you think that… "

"真嗣，" 我终于开口，嘴巴突然干得像骨头一样。"你...你觉得... "

A distant rumble interrupted me in mid question. It certainly couldn't have been thunder. The day was sunny and quite hot, with not a cloud to be seen. Also, this was more insistent and continuous than thunder was wont to be.

远处的一阵隆隆声打断了我正要提出的问题。那肯定不是雷声。那天阳光明媚，相当炎热，连一丝云彩都看不见。而且，这声音比雷声更持久、连续。

And it was coming from the direction of Tokyo-3.

它来自东京三号地区的方向。

I looked around, unable to see the source of the noise until Shinji's arm pointed straight out in front of me. The JSSDF gun emplacements that surrounded Tokyo-3 were opening up for all they were worth at something that was out of sight to us behind the foothills to the west of the city.

我环顾四周，直到真嗣的手臂直直地指向我前方，才找到噪音的来源。日本自卫队围绕第三新东京市的炮台正全力以赴地向着城市西边丘陵后我们看不见的某个目标开火。

"Do you think it could be an Angel?" Shinji asked.

"你觉得那会是一个天使吗？" 真嗣问道。

"I doubt it." I replied uncertainly. "If an Angel got this close to Tokyo-3 our cell phones would have gone off. Anyway, they always retract the main buildings at the slightest hint of an Angel, and they're still standing, it can't be!"

“我对此表示怀疑。”我犹豫地回答，“如果有天使接近东京-3，我们的手机早就响了。再说，他们一有天使的迹象就会把主要建筑缩回去，现在建筑还立着，不可能是天使！”

In unison we both whipped out our NERV issued cell phones.

我们俩同时掏出了 NERV 发放的手机。

"Ach! No signal!" "啊！没信号！"

"Me neither!" Said Shinji.

"我也不！" 真嗣说道。

"Shit!" I said. "We'd better get down to the Geofront and find out what's going on before they sic Section 2 onto us!"

"该死！" 我说道，"我们最好赶紧去地下都市，弄清楚到底发生了什么，免得他们派第二部门来对付我们！"

Shinji went to gather up our picnic, but I stopped him.

真嗣去收拾我们的野餐，但我阻止了他。

"Leave it there, baka!" I said more harshly than I meant to. "It'll just slow us down. It's all Misato's stuff anyway!"

"就放在那儿，笨蛋！" 我语气比预想的要严厉。"带着只会拖慢我们。反正都是美里姐的东西！"

Shinji frowned. "I'll come back for it afterwards." He said.

真嗣皱了皱眉。“我待会儿再来拿。”他说道。

"Fine, whatever. Let's go already!" The JSSDF artillery was growing louder and more insistent by now.

好了，随便吧。我们快走吧！此时，日本自卫队的炮火声越来越响，越来越急促。

With Shinji trailing behind me we set off as quickly as we could through the rock and debris, making our way back down into Tokyo-3 and what would become one of the worst days of my life.

我带着紧随其后的真嗣，尽可能快地穿过岩石和瓦砾，一路返回东京-3，那一天将成为我一生中最糟糕的日子之一。

END CHAPTER TWO 第二章结束

A/N: From here on the format will be alternating POVs from Shinji and Asuka. My take on it is that in their early episodes together, even though Asuka was still ultra competitive, she seemed to be quite drawn to Shinji and even seemed to quite like him in her own way. It was mainly later, as things turned ugly, that her own self-hatred caused her to lash out in a more openly abusive fashion. I'm very much more focussed on the early Asuka and that is the basis for my interpretation of her character.

作者注：从这里开始，格式将交替呈现真嗣和明日香的视角。我的理解是，在他们早期的共同剧集中，尽管明日香依然极具竞争性，但她似乎对真嗣颇有好感，甚至以她自己的方式相当喜欢他。主要是后来情况恶化，她内心的自我厌恶导致她以更公开的虐待方式发泄。我更关注早期的明日香，这也是我对她角色解读的基础。

That's my take on it anyway. As Always I ask for: 1) forgiveness for changing canon to suit my story, and 2) reviews, because I crave the attention!

无论如何，这就是我的看法。一如既往，我请求：1) 原谅我为了适应我的故事而改变原作，2) 请留下评论，因为我渴望关注！

Toodles... Donderkind. 再见... 唐德金德。

## Chapter 3 Mea Culpa 我的过失

To say that my Father was a little angry that day was kind of like saying that the replica pirate ships that ferry the tourists around Lake Ashi were a little tacky.

那天说我的父亲有点生气，就像是说载着游客在芦之湖上游览的仿制海盗船有点俗气一样。

My Father was a lot angry.

我的父亲非常生气。

Asuka, Misato and I stood in his huge sepulchral office, with its cavernous interior and The Desk. The massive desk that strangely dominated the enormous office. Father and Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, as always, were in dark silhouette, backlit by the panoramic windows showing the Geofront sprawling out in all directions. It was all designed, of course, to awe the supplicant and lend an air of menace and mystery to the man who sat behind that desk.

我和明日香、美里站在他那巨大的、阴森的办公室里，内部空间宽敞，还有那张办公桌。那张巨大的桌子，奇怪地占据了这间宽敞办公室的主导地位。父亲和副指挥官冬月，一如既往地以剪影出现，背对着展示第三新东京市全景的窗户。这一切当然都是为了震慑来访者，并为坐在那张桌子后面的人增添一种威严和神秘的气息。

It wasn't really to my taste I must say. Some nice curtains, a couch or two and some uplights to lighten the ambience wouldn't have gone astray, in my opinion. Maybe a couple of throw cushions even.

我得说，这并不合我的口味。如果有些漂亮的窗帘、一两张沙发和一些向上照射的灯光来改善氛围，我觉得会更好。甚至可能还需要几个抱枕。

As Asuka often likes to point out, my opinions are seldom relevant to what's actually going on. When she wants my opinion, she always says, she'll give it to me.

正如明日香常喜欢指出的那样，我的观点很少与实际情况相关。当她想要我的意见时，她总是说，她会给我。

I could feel myself swaying slightly in time with the air-conditioning. Damn it was cold in there! Why was it always so freaking cold? I guess that Father liked to see people shivering when face to face with The Commander of one of the most powerful organisations on Earth. Geez, and people wonder why I have issues!

我能感觉到自己随着空调的节奏微微摇摆。该死，那里真冷！为什么总是这么冷得要命？我猜父亲喜欢看到人们在面对地球上最强大组织之一的指挥官时瑟瑟发抖。天哪，人们还纳闷我为什么有问题！

I reached up an attempted to adjust the bandage around my forehead, not a chance, it was far too tightly bound.

我伸手试图调整额头上的绷带，但没可能，它绑得太紧了。

Sub Commander Fuyutsuki was currently berating Misato about dereliction of her duty as Operations Director and as guardian of two of NERV's piloting personnel. She stood ramrod straight between Asuka and me. Several beads of sweat running down her brow despite the coolness of the office. Father just sat there silently, hands tented in front of him. Let me just state for the record that I despised that pose.

副司令冬月现在正斥责美里，指责她作为作战部主任和 NERV 两名驾驶员的监护人玩忽职守。她在我们和明日香之间站得笔直，尽管办公室里很凉爽，但她的额头上还是渗出了几滴汗珠。父亲只是静静地坐在那里，双手在面前交叠。让我明确记录一下，我讨厌那个姿势。

Asuka too, wouldn't look at me. Her gaze was fixed to the bare floor of the office. Her face white against her red hair. A dark streak of dirt and what could have been dried blood stood out against her pale skin.

明日香也是，不愿看我。她的目光紧盯着办公室裸露的地板。她苍白的脸庞与红发形成鲜明对比。一道暗色的污迹，可能是干涸的血迹，在她白皙的皮肤上格外显眼。

Yep, I was definitely starting to sway quite a lot. My head ached terribly and I was beginning to feel pretty woozy. Hopefully this chewing out wouldn't take too much longer, I really needed to lie down rather urgently.

是的，我确实开始摇晃得厉害。头痛欲裂，我开始感到相当眩晕。希望这次训斥不会太久，我真的急需躺下休息，非常迫切。

In my state of distraction it took me several moments to notice how quiet it had become. Uh-oh, I thought, why is everyone looking at me now?

在我心神不宁的状态下，我花了好一会儿才注意到周围变得多么安静。哎呀，我想，为什么现在大家都盯着我看呢？

"Huh?" It barely qualifies as a word, but it was the best I could do at such short notice and under the circumstances. I did notice Asuka roll her eyes at me.

"嗯？" 这几乎算不上一个词，但在如此仓促和这种情况下，这是我所能做到的最好了。我确实注意到明日香对我翻了个白眼。

"Third Child." My Father said.

"第三个孩子。" 我父亲说。

"Yes sir?" I finally managed to croak in answer.

"是的，先生？" 我终于勉强回答道。

"What do you have to say to excuse yourself and Pilot Soryu's actions this day?"

你有什么话要为自己和今天碇真嗣的行为辩解吗？

Hmm… Not a bad question. Let me think about it for a moment…

嗯……这个问题不错。让我想一想……

It had all started off not too badly, I guess. Asuka and I had gone off on an unscheduled day trip out to look at a dirty great hole in the ground. She was actually being nice to me for a change. Well, nice for Asuka that is. I had even managed to surreptitiously, (And completely by accident I swear) see right down the front of her sundress. I was definitely going to file that image away for future… ahem... reference… And I had managed to eat and keep down what may have been the worst Cup Noodle I have ever had in my entire life.

我想，一切开始时还不算太糟。我和明日香临时决定去郊外一日游，去看一个巨大的地坑。她居然破天荒地对我友好了起来。嗯，至少是明日香式的友好。我甚至偷偷地（我发誓，绝对是意外）瞥见了她太阳裙下的风光。我肯定要把这画面珍藏起来，以备将来……咳咳……参考之用。而且，我还吃下了可能是我这辈子尝过最难吃的杯面，并且没吐出来。

And then the faecal matter well and truly hit the ventilator.

然后，事情彻底变得一团糟。

After the JSSDF artillery had begun its well-meaning but essentially useless barrage of what would soon be designated the Ninth Angel. Asuka and I had begun a mad scramble back to Tokyo-3 and the Geofront.

在自卫队炮兵开始其善意却实质无用的对即将被指定为第九使徒的炮击后，我和明日香便开始疯狂地赶回第三新东京市及地下都市。

Things had gone pretty well to begin with. Asuka and I made good time into the outer suburbs of Tokyo-3. We both were quite fit from months of training, much more so than your average teenagers would be I guess. The JSSDF artillery was falling much closer now though, almost deafeningly loud as the shells exploded frighteningly near to where we were running. Both of us trying to get to Emergency Access Route K-17 down to the Geofront.

起初一切进展得相当顺利。我和明日香迅速进入了第三新东京市的外围郊区。经过数月的训练，我们的体能远超一般青少年。然而，日本自卫队的炮火越来越近，炮弹在我们奔跑的地方附近爆炸，震耳欲聋。我们两人正竭力赶往通往地下都市的紧急通道 K-17。

I saw that Asuka, who was about 10 metres ahead of me, had stopped suddenly and was staring open mouthed to the west of the City centre. I slowed down to stand next to her and see what she was staring at.

我看到大约在我前方 10 米处的明日香突然停下脚步，张大嘴巴凝视着市中心西侧。我放慢速度，走到她身边，想看看她在注视什么。

Now I'm not arachnophobic. I'm a catch and release kinda guy. Maybe I'll give the odd creepy crawley to Pen-Pen as a supplement to his diet, but I've got nothing personal against spiders. The Ninth Angel, though, it gave me the screaming Hebegebees, I won't lie. It was in the form of a massive, nay, a Gargantuan Spider. Probably at least 80 metres across its body, and with its freakishly long legs, I couldn't even begin to guess the total width.

我现在并不怕蜘蛛。我是个抓了就放的人。或许我会偶尔给 Pen-Pen 喂些爬虫作为他饮食的补充，但我对蜘蛛并无个人恩怨。然而，第九使徒却让我吓得魂飞魄散，我不会撒谎。它以一只巨大，不，是巨型蜘蛛的形态出现。其身体宽度可能至少有 80 米，加上那长得离谱的腿，我根本无法估算其总宽度。

And the eyes! Holy Crap The Eyes! All over its jet black body were these shimmering, almost translucent eyes. I still see those things in my nightmares I swear! Each one seemed alive and malevolent. To look into those eyes was to feel the weight and certainty of the righteous slaughter that those ocular prisms promised.

还有那些眼睛！天啊，那些眼睛！遍布它那乌黑的身体，闪烁着，几乎透明的眼睛。我发誓，至今仍在噩梦中见到它们！每一个都似乎充满生机且恶意满满。直视那些眼睛，就如同感受到那些视觉棱镜所承诺的正义屠戮的沉重与确定性。

Now I always feel that it was the fact that I had actually seen an Angel from ground level once before that helped me come to my senses a few moments before Asuka did.

现在我总感觉，是因为我曾在地面上亲眼见过一次天使，这让我比明日香早几秒清醒过来。

"Come on Asuka! Let's get outta here!" I yelled in her ear as I grabbed her hand and pulled her down the street with me. Just in time too. The intersection that we had been standing at was pretty much obliterated by shellfire 15 seconds or so after we left it. Chunks of flying masonry landed around us as we ran on, still holding hands.

“快点，明日香！我们离开这里！”我对着她的耳朵大喊，同时抓住她的手，拉着她和我一起沿着街道奔跑。真是及时，就在我们离开大约 15 秒后，我们之前站立的十字路口几乎被炮火夷为平地。我们一边跑，一边紧握着手，周围不断有飞溅的砖石碎片落下。

The Angel continued on through the smashed intersection completely unharmed as the artillery bombardment continued on around it.

天使继续穿过被炸毁的十字路口，毫发无损，而周围的炮火轰炸仍在持续。

The fact that its final destination and ours were essentially the same did rattle around somewhere in the back of my mind, but blind panic was filtering all thought beyond 'RUN!' from my mind quite efficiently at that moment.

尽管它的最终目的地与我们的基本相同这一事实确实在我脑海深处隐约回响，但在那一刻，盲目的恐慌正高效地将除“快跑！”之外的所有思绪从我心中过滤掉。

"Shinji!" Asuka yelled at me, coughing in the dust from the explosions. "It's gaining on us!"

"真嗣！" 明日香朝我喊道，爆炸扬起的尘土让她咳嗽不止，"它追上来了！"

My mind was still very much in the flight part of the fight or flight response. I was still focussed on getting to K-17 that I was taken completely by surprise as Asuka yanked roughly on my hand and sent both myself and her sprawling into an alleyway by the side of the main road we had been running down.

我的思绪仍深陷于“战斗或逃跑反应”中的逃跑部分。我仍全神贯注于赶往 K-17，以至于当明日香猛地拽住我的手，将我和她自己一起拽进主路旁的一条小巷时，我完全措手不及。

Jumping back to my feet I was just in time to see one of the shiny and massive black legs of the Angel smash down on the concrete where we had just been running. Huge cracks opened up, crazing out from the point of impact.

我迅速跳起身来，正好目睹天使那闪亮而巨大的黑色腿脚猛地砸在我们刚刚奔跑过的混凝土上。巨大的裂缝随即张开，从撞击点向外蔓延。

Still the JSSDF artillery pounded on around us, which I just couldn't understand. Surely they should have handed over to NERV by now? All of this destruction of property was pointless, conventional weaponry was useless against the Angels after all.

尽管如此，日本自卫队的炮火仍在四周持续轰鸣，这让我完全无法理解。他们现在肯定应该已经将指挥权移交给 NERV 了吧？所有这些对财产的破坏都是毫无意义的，毕竟常规武器对天使根本无效。

A shell exploded just outside the alleyway, causing Asuka and I to dive behind a dumpster as shrapnel whizzed past and banged into the metal and brick around us.

一枚炮弹就在小巷外爆炸了，我和明日香赶紧跳到垃圾箱后面躲避，弹片嗖嗖地从身边飞过，撞击着周围的金属和砖墙。

"Those idiots!" Asuka yelled at me over the noise of the barrage. "They'll never damage the Angel like this! All they'll do is get us killed!"

"那些蠢货！" 明日香在炮火声中对我大声喊道，"他们这样永远伤不了使徒！只会把我们害死！"

I nodded in agreement.

我点头表示同意。

"Let's get out of here!" She said, tightening her grip on my hand as she pulled me out from behind the dumpster and back up the alley.

"我们快离开这里！" 她说着，紧紧抓住我的手，从垃圾箱后面拉着我，沿着小巷往回走。

I was about to voice some concern about the danger not being past yet when what could only be described as an ear-splitting crack rent the air around us and the World went suddenly and unexpectedly black.

我正要表达对危险尚未过去的担忧时，一声震耳欲聋的巨响撕裂了我们周围的空气，世界突然间出乎意料地陷入了一片漆黑。

I slowly emerged from the darkness to the sound of coughing. My back hurt like you wouldn't believe and my head felt like it was caught in a vise. The pressure on my chest, though not hard and jagged like at my back, was still making it difficult to draw breath.

我缓缓从黑暗中浮现，耳边是阵阵咳嗽声。我的背痛得难以置信，头仿佛被夹在虎钳中。尽管胸口的压力不像背部那样坚硬而尖锐，但仍让我呼吸困难。

Where was I? I wracked my brain, nothing. Still nothing. Hang on a moment. A couple of random images flashed before me. I searched further. There it was, I discovered in my mind an inflammation swollen and deformed, my memory.

我刚才说到哪儿了？我绞尽脑汁，一无所获。依旧一片空白。稍等片刻。几幅零星的画面在我眼前闪过。我继续探寻。找到了，我在脑海中发现了一处肿胀变形的炎症，那正是我的记忆。

Oooohhhh… Shit. That's right… The Angel!

哦哦哦……该死。对了……是天使！

I sat up and immediately my head collided with something hard, the impact was enough to have little stars of pain dancing around in front of my still closed eyes.

我坐起身来，头立刻撞上了什么硬物，撞击的力度让疼痛的小星星在我紧闭的眼前跳跃。

"Owwwwww! You idiot!" "哎哟！你这个笨蛋！"

"Uh… sorry Asuka." I said opening my eyes, which probably would have been the smart thing to do before I had tried to sit up.

“呃……对不起，明日香。”我说着睁开了眼睛，这或许在我试图坐起来之前就是个明智之举。

My left eye was a little fuzzy and didn't seem to want to open all the way, but the right one was working perfectly. What it showed me was a terrifying close up of a fierce sapphire blue iris a mere inch or so away from it. Asuka was right on top of me, her right hand to her head at the point of impact. Her eyes were watering in the brick dust and debris.

我的左眼有些模糊，似乎不太愿意完全睁开，但右眼却运作正常。它所呈现给我的是一幅恐怖的特写：一只凶猛的蓝宝石色虹膜，仅有一英寸左右的距离。明日香正压在我身上，她的右手按在撞击点上方的头部。她的眼睛因砖尘和碎片而泛着泪光。

So that meant that the weight on my chest that was softer and more yielding than the rest of the debris surrounding me was…. Oh God.

这意味着压在我胸口的那块比周围其他碎片更柔软、更易变形的重量是……哦，天啊。

"If you move, or try anything weird, Third Child, I will personally remodel your face so that you'll be able to clean your teeth by sticking your toothbrush up your nose!"

如果你敢动，或者耍什么花样，第三适格者，我会亲自改造你的脸，让你能通过把牙刷塞进鼻子里来刷牙！

It was best to take Asuka at her word at these times. Although it was difficult to focus with her chest pushed up hard against my own by all the debris. But I had to control any reactions I may have otherwise had in such a situation, or she might just kill me. 'Okay, I can do this… Just try not to think of her soft round fleshy… Dammit! I said try not to think about it! Just think about the rubble that we seem to be trapped beneath. That's the ticket! Good old painfully crushing unsexy rubble.'

这种时候最好相信明日香的话。尽管由于周围的瓦砾，她的胸部紧紧压在我的胸膛上，让人难以集中注意力。但我必须控制住在这种情况下可能产生的任何反应，否则她可能会杀了我。“好吧，我能做到的……尽量不要去想她那柔软圆润的……该死！我说了不要去想！只想着我们似乎被困在其下的这些瓦砾。没错！就是这些令人痛苦、毫无性感可言的旧瓦砾。”

"Uh… okay Asuka. Where are we anyway?" I said between shallow breaths.

"呃……好吧，明日香。我们到底在哪儿？" 我喘着粗气问道。

"Gee, let me take an educated guess and say we're under a pile of masonry somewhere just near the End of Life as We Know It!" Sarcasm was one of Asuka's real strengths.

"哎呀，让我来个有根据的猜测，我们应该是被埋在一堆砖石下面，就在‘我们所知的生活尽头’附近！" 讽刺是明日香真正的强项之一。

I could see that she was right, at least about the rubble that was.

我能看出她是对的，至少关于那些瓦砾是如此。

"So, Invincible Shinji. What's the master plan for getting us out of here?"

那么，无敌的真嗣，带我们离开这里的总计划是什么？

I looked around me, my nose brushing hers briefly as I did.

我环顾四周，不经意间我的鼻子轻触了她的。

"Hey! Watch it!" 嘿！小心点！

"Just deal with it Asuka. I'm trying to figure out what's around us!"

就应付一下吧，明日香。我正在努力弄清楚我们周围的情况！

I could see that we had actually been quite lucky. The lid of the dumpster had covered our bodies quite effectively. Although I think that it probably had struck me on the head as it landed as I could see some blood on the corner nearest my now painfully throbbing left eye. Asuka herself was kind of diagonally across my upper body, mainly her torso and upper body on mine and her legs slightly off to the side.

我能看出我们其实相当幸运。垃圾箱的盖子很好地遮盖了我们的身体。尽管我认为它落下时可能砸到了我的头，因为我能看到离我现在疼痛跳动的左眼最近的角落上有血迹。明日香自己则斜跨在我的上半身上，主要是她的躯干和上半身压在我身上，而她的腿则稍微偏向一边。

"Wait a minute…" I said. "I think that I can move my legs!"

"等一下……" 我说，"我觉得我能动我的腿了！"

Sure enough, with some effort I was able to free them from the rubble and bend them up into a braced position.

果然，经过一番努力，我成功地将它们从废墟中解救出来，并弯折成支撑状态。

"Well?" Asuka said with unmasked concern.

"怎么了？" 明日香带着不加掩饰的关切问道。

"Okay…" I replied. "I'm going to try something."

"好的……" 我回答道，"我要尝试一下某个方法。"

I lifted my arms up and out on either side of her.

我抬起双臂，在她两侧向外伸展。

"Hey! What do you think you're doing, Shinji?" She said in alarm at my actions. I could tell she really was anxious because she actually called me by my first name.

"嘿！你以为你在做什么，真嗣？" 她看到我的举动，惊慌地说道。我能感觉到她真的很焦虑，因为她实际上叫了我的名字。

I didn't reply. Gritting my teeth and tensing my muscles painfully against the rocks at my back I pushed with all of my strength at the dumpster lid above us. Nothing… still nothing… it felt like the rubble under me was about to crack my ribs like dry twigs. I'm sure that I felt blood start to flow back there, and also I could feel it trickle anew from the cut above my left eye.

我没有回应。我咬紧牙关，痛苦地绷紧肌肉，背靠着岩石，用尽全力推着我们头顶上的垃圾箱盖。什么也没有……还是什么也没有……感觉我身下的瓦砾快要像干树枝一样压断我的肋骨。我确信我感觉到血开始从那里流出来，同时也能感觉到左眼上方的伤口又有新的血迹渗出。

"Shinji…" Asuka said with genuine concern. I kept pushing.

"真嗣…" 明日香带着真切的关心说道。我继续推进。

Finally I felt something shift up there and I was able to straighten my arms further.

最终，我感觉到上面有了些变化，我的手臂得以进一步伸直。

"Asuka!" I said gasping between clenched teeth. "Can you move?"

"明日香！" 我紧咬着牙关喘息着说，"你能动吗？"

She didn't answer, but she started to wriggle slowly from side to side. The weight was becoming unbearable. I could feel my arms shaking uncontrollable under the strain of it.

她没有回答，但开始慢慢地左右扭动。重量变得难以承受。我能感觉到我的手臂在压力下不由自主地颤抖。

"Yes!" She finally answered.

"是的！" 她终于回答了。

She continued wriggling and I could feel her moving slowly, painfully slowly, down my body. Grunting and gasping as she went. Time moved so very slowly at that moment, I'm not sure how I managed to hold it up while she got out, but eventually, after what felt like an age, I could no longer feel her body moving against my own.

她继续扭动着，我能感觉到她缓慢地、极其缓慢地沿着我的身体移动。她一边移动一边发出哼哼和喘息声。那一刻，时间流逝得异常缓慢，我不确定自己是怎么在她离开时坚持住的，但最终，在仿佛过了许久之后，我再也感觉不到她的身体与我的摩擦。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

There was no answer but the clinking and grunting of her moving through the rubble. Then even that ceased. Terror gripped me for the first time that day. Had she left me? Was she okay? What was happening out there? The uncertainty was almost crippling.

没有回应，只有她穿过瓦砾时的叮当声和咕哝声。随后连这些声音也消失了。那天，恐惧第一次紧紧抓住了我。她离开我了吗？她还好吗？外面发生了什么？这种不确定性几乎让人瘫痪。

"Asuka!" I croaked out. The strain was just about unbearable. My arms were two burning rods of pain.

"明日香！" 我嘶哑地喊出声。这压力几乎让人无法承受。我的双臂如同两根燃烧的痛苦之棒。

Then there was a bang that I felt vibrate against the steel of the dumpster lid as something moved against it. And then another. Slowly but surely the lid above me began to get lighter and lighter. I could suddenly straighten my arms above my and lock my elbows to help ease the agony in my triceps. Then it was gone. The lid was lifted off and crashed deafeningly beside me as dusty light filtered down onto me.

接着，一声巨响传来，我能感觉到垃圾桶盖上的钢板因某物的移动而震动。随后又是一声。慢慢地，我头顶上的盖子开始变得越来越亮。我突然能伸直双臂，锁住肘部，以缓解三头肌的剧痛。然后，一切消失了。盖子被掀开，轰然落在身旁，尘埃中的光线洒落在我身上。

Above me stood Asuka Langley Soryu, the Great Asuka Langley Soryu. Dusty and with her yellow sundress hanging off her all torn and filthy, she was, at that moment, perhaps the most beautiful sight I think I have even seen.

在我上方，站立着伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷，尘埃满身，她那件黄色太阳裙破烂不堪，污迹斑斑地挂在身上。那一刻，她或许是我见过的最美丽的景象。

She grinned at me hugely from her vantage point.

她从她的有利位置向我咧嘴大笑。

"Well, don't just lie there all day with your hands in the air Third Child! Get your lazy butt up and moving, we've got an Angel to kill!"

“喂，别整天躺在那儿举着手了，第三适格者！快起来动动你那懒屁股，我们还有个使徒要消灭呢！”

She held her hand down to me and I reached up and clasped her wrist and she mine as she hauled me quickly to my feet.

她向我伸出手，我伸手紧紧抓住她的手腕，而她也同样握住我的手腕，迅速将我拉了起来。

"Geez, you look like crap, Third!" She said with a grin as I dusted myself off.

"天哪，你看起来糟透了，第三！" 她笑着说，而我正在掸去身上的灰尘。

"Thank you, Asuka." Was all that I managed in way of witty riposte. Not that she looked much better from what I could make out with my good eye.

"谢谢你，明日香。" 这就是我勉强挤出的机智回应。其实，从我那只好眼睛能看清楚的情况来看，她看起来也没好到哪里去。

At least all was now quiet as we picked our way through the rubble and shattered masonry and headed for the entrance to our alley.

至少现在一切都安静了，我们小心翼翼地穿过瓦砾和破碎的砖石，朝着通往我们小巷的入口走去。

"Thank God that shelling has finally stopped." Asuka said, mirroring my own thoughts. "Those JSSDF knuckleheads took long enough to hand over to NERV! Now let's get down there and kill this Angel already!"

"谢天谢地，炮击总算停了。" 明日香说道，与我心有灵犀。"那些日本自卫队的家伙们拖了这么久才把指挥权交给 NERV！现在我们快下去，把这个使徒解决掉吧！"

As we rounded the corner and back out onto the main road we both came to a complete stop at the scene before us.

当我们拐过弯再次回到主路时，我们俩都在眼前的景象前完全停下了脚步。

About one kilometre away, just past the entrance to Access Point K-17 that we sought actually, the massive form of the Angel could clearly be seen. It was kind of hunkered down with it's somewhat ovaloid body sitting much lower than it had been the last time we had seen it.

大约一公里外，就在我们寻找的 K-17 接入点入口之后，天使的巨大身躯清晰可见。它的身体呈略微椭圆形，蹲伏着，比我们上次见到时低得多。

It was, quite obviously, dead.

显然，它已经死了。

The most telling clue to this wasn't the massive progressive Bowie Knife sticking out of the top of its body, nor was it the congealing trail of what must be Angelic blood slowly dripping from said knife-wound. What really gave it away was Unit-00 slumped in its 'Deactivated' position next to the carcass of the Angel. Two enormous battery packs still attached to its back.

最明显的线索并非那把巨大的渐进式鲍伊刀从其身体顶部突出，也不是从那刀伤处缓缓滴落的凝固天使之血的痕迹。真正揭露真相的是，零号机以“已停机”的姿态颓然倒在天使尸体旁，背上还挂着两个巨大的电池包。

"We must have been out for longer than we thought." I said. The girl beside me was strangely silent.

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"NO!" Asuka actually screamed.

"不！" 明日香竟然尖叫起来。

"Asuka… " 明日香……

"Just Shut-up Shinji!" She screamed at me.

"闭嘴，真嗣！" 她对我尖叫道。

"But… " 然而… "

"I… I cannot believe this! That bitch, that fucking Doll, fights that Angel, in a solo battle, without external power or backup and singlehandedly defeats it while I'm lying useless in a pile of rubble with you!"

我……我简直不敢相信！那个贱人，那个该死的玩偶，竟然独自与天使战斗，在没有外援和后盾的情况下，单枪匹马击败了它，而我却和你一起无用地躺在废墟中！

"But, that's good isn't it?" I'm nothing if not completely clueless. "Defeating the Angels isn't a contest Asuka. Shouldn't we be happy that… "

"但是，这不是好事吗？" 我真是完全一无所知。"击败使徒并不是比赛，明日香。我们难道不应该为此感到高兴吗……"

I was stopped mid-sentence by the angry German girl grabbing me by the front of my shirt and roughly pushing me up against the wall. Given my recently gained injuries from our burial in the alley I gasped in pain at the impact.

我话说到一半，就被那个愤怒的德国女孩抓住我的衣领，粗暴地将我推到墙上。考虑到我刚从巷子里的埋伏中受的伤，撞击的瞬间我痛得倒吸一口凉气。

"You listen to me, Third Child! Nobody, but nobody, shows me up as a pilot in front of the whole World. Not you and certainly not that emotionless animated marionette Ayanami!" She spat out the name.

你给我听着，第三适格者！没有任何人，绝对没有任何人，能在全世界面前让我这个驾驶员丢脸。不会是你，更不可能是那个毫无情感的动画傀儡绫波丽！她狠狠地吐出这个名字。

She stayed there, breathing heavily inches away from my face for several moments. I quailed, feeling as if she might just strike me at any moment.

她留在那里，离我的脸只有几英寸，沉重地呼吸了好一会儿。我感到害怕，仿佛她随时都可能打我。

However… I was spared. Kind of.

然而……我幸免于难。算是吧。

"Freeze!" Came a harsh, commanding, voice from behind Asuka. She let go of me and spun around to face its owner.

"站住！"一个严厉而命令式的声音从明日香身后传来。她松开我，转身面对声音的主人。

Three Section 2 Operatives stood before us, guns in hand.

三名第二节特工站在我们面前，手持枪械。

"Pilots Ikari and Soryu?" Their leader said. We both nodded. He then put his hand up to his earpiece. "Targets acquired."

"飞行员碇和惣流吗？"他们的领导问道。我们俩都点了点头。随后，他把手举到耳边，对着耳麦说："目标已锁定。"

Targets? 目标？

The man nodded several times. "Understood."

男子连连点头，“明白了。”

The Agents still kept their guns drawn.

特工们仍然持枪戒备。

"Hey," Asuka began. She got no further.

"嘿，" 明日香开口道，但她没能继续说下去。

"Pilot Soryu," The man said emotionlessly. "Please refrain from speaking or acting in any way counter to our instructions. If you fail to do so I am authorised to take certain measures to ensure your compliance. Am I understood?"

"飞行员 Soryu," 那人毫无感情地说道，"请不要以任何方式违背我们的指示。如果你不这样做，我有权采取某些措施确保你遵守。明白了吗？"

Once again we both nodded. In short order a black windowless van pulled up in front of us. The side door slid open.

我们俩再次点头。很快，一辆黑色无窗的货车停在了我们面前。侧门随即滑开。

"Get in." The man said, gesturing with his pistol. We got in, followed by our escort of Section 2 Agents. Their side-arms remained in their hands for the whole trip down to the Geofront.

"上车。" 男子说着，用手枪示意。我们上了车，随后是第二部门的特工们作为我们的护卫。他们手中的武器在整个前往地底的旅途中始终未曾放下。

Asuka stared at the floor not even acknowledging my attempts to catch her eye.

明日香盯着地板，甚至没有理会我试图与她眼神交流的尝试。

I think that trip in the van was probably the loneliest that I have ever felt in my entire life.

我觉得那次在面包车上的旅行，可能是我一生中感到最孤独的一次。

"Well, Third Child? I am awaiting your reply." My Father's voice fell strangely flat in the chill air of the office.

“那么，三子？我在等你回话。”父亲的声音在办公室的寒气中显得异常平淡。

Misato stood rigidly to attention beside me. I did feel bad for her having to suffer the Commander's wrath this way. She already was working sixteen hour days in her position as Head of Operations with NERV, as well as full time guardian to two overly hormonal and angst driven teenagers on top of that. She was a good person. She didn't deserve this.

源渡站在我旁边，身体僵硬地立正。我确实为她感到难过，因为她不得不以这种方式承受指挥官的怒火。她作为 NERV 的运营主管，已经每天工作十六个小时，此外还要全职照顾两个荷尔蒙过剩、情绪不稳定的青少年。她是个好人，不应该遭受这样的对待。

Asuka remained staring at a point just near the base of my Father's desk. My mouth twisted slightly. I could read the anxiety in her in big bold letters. Asuka hated weakness. Asuka hated blind unquestioning obedience. Most of all Asuka hated disapproval and not having the ability to defend herself. Impotence was an anathema to the Second Child. I could see that she was almost being crushed by her powerlessness in that situation.

明日香依旧凝视着父亲书桌基座附近的一点。我的嘴角微微扭曲。她内心的焦虑，我看得一清二楚，如同用粗体大字书写。明日香厌恶软弱，憎恨盲目无条件的服从。最让她痛恨的，是遭到反对和无法自卫。无能为力对第二适格者而言，简直是诅咒。我能感觉到，那一刻她几乎要被自己的无助压垮。

The two people I cared about more than any others were being made miserable by the man who seemed to despise me more than anything else in the World. My own Father. It was time to 'Sack Up' as Toji would have said. I couldn't let the others suffer for my Father's apparent personal disdain of me.

我最在乎的两个人正被那个似乎对我怀有世界最大轻蔑的人折磨着，那人正是我的父亲。是时候像东二所说的那样“鼓起勇气”了。我不能让其他人因为我父亲对我明显的个人蔑视而受苦。

I cleared my throat and attempted to stop my body swaying in time with the rhythm of the hammer and anvil that seemed to be clanging between my ears.

我清了清嗓子，试图阻止身体随着那仿佛在我耳边铿锵作响的锤子与砧板的节奏摇摆。

"It was my fault, Father." I could sense Misato stiffen beside me and a small gasp from Asuka.

"这是我的错，父亲。" 我能感觉到身旁的 Misato 身体一僵，还有 Asuka 轻微的抽气声。

"Commander." My Father said.

"指挥官。" 我父亲说道。

"It was my fault, Commander." I corrected, "I… I convinced the Second Child to come with me to… to the Arcade in the Shibuse Hypermall. She… She tried to refuse but I-I convinced her that we had been given the right as Evangelion Pilots to take personal time away from school as long as we continued piloting satisfactorily. I-I'm sorry Asuka, for lying to you about this." I said, though the girl continued to stare blankly, "And I apologise Fa… Commander. Please punish me as you see fit. But the Second Child and Captain Katsuragi bear no responsibility in this matter." I bowed my head. I could feel the eyes of everyone in that office upon me. I could sense Misato's disbelief at what I had done and I could definitely feel the ice blue eyes of Asuka boring into the side of my head from over eight feet away.

“是我的错，指挥官。”我纠正道，“我……我说服了第二适格者跟我一起去……去涩部超大型购物中心的游戏厅。她……她试图拒绝，但我——我说服了她，作为 EVA 驾驶员，只要我们继续满意地驾驶，就有权在不上学时享受个人时间。我——对不起，明日香，我在这件事上对你撒了谎。”我说着，尽管女孩依旧茫然地盯着，“我向您道歉，指挥官。请按您的判断惩罚我。但第二适格者和葛城上尉在这件事上没有责任。”我低下头。我能感觉到办公室里每个人的目光都集中在我身上。我能察觉到葛城对我的行为感到难以置信，也绝对能感受到明日香那冰蓝色的眼睛从八英尺开外直刺我侧脸的目光。

"I see." My Father finally responded. He remained impassive and silent for several more minutes. Finally he spoke again. "Very well. Captain Katsuragi, Pilot Soryu." They both stiffened. "You are dismissed."

"我明白了。" 父亲终于回应道。他继续保持冷漠和沉默，又过了几分钟。最终，他再次开口："很好。葛城队长，索龙飞行员。" 两人顿时紧张起来。"你们可以退下了。"

"Sir?" Misato answered. "先生？" 碇真嗣回答道。

"I see that you have no blame to answer in this matter, although responsibility is another issue entirely. You are both dismissed from my presence. I will discuss both blame and consequence with the Third Child further once you have departed."

我明白在这件事上你无需承担指责，尽管责任是另一回事。你们俩都可以退下了。待你们离开后，我会与第三子进一步讨论责任与后果。

"B-but…" "但…"

"Dismissed." 解雇。

"Yes Sir." Misato and Asuka both bowed and exited the office quickly.

"是的，先生。" 碇真嗣和明日香同时鞠躬，迅速离开了办公室。

A still silence returned to the sterile office.

死寂再次笼罩了这间无菌的办公室。

"Third Child." 《第三孩》

"Yes, Commander?" "是的，指挥官？"

"I have allowed you to spare your co-workers from blame or punishment for the time. However, do not think that I believe your lies or applaud your imagined selflessness in taking the responsibility for today's actions. You are aware, are you not, of the consequences of failure in this struggle with the Angels? The fate of the whole of Humanity should not and must not be jeopardised by the whims and selfishness of a mere child. Do you understand?"

我曾允许你为同事们挡下责难与惩罚，但这并不意味着我信了你的谎言，或是对你自诩为今日行为负责的无私之举表示赞赏。你清楚，不是吗，在这场与天使的斗争中失败的后果？全人类的命运绝不应也不可因一个孩子的任性与自私而陷入险境。你明白了吗？

"Y-Yes Sir." "是，长官。"

"It is fortunate for all of us that Pilot Ayanami was available to us and showed the initiative to make her way to the Geofront as soon as she realised something was wrong, and then defeat the Angel single-handedly.

我们所有人都很幸运，飞行员绫波能及时出现并展现出主动性，一察觉到异常便迅速前往 Geofront，随后更是单枪匹马击败了使徒。

"Yes Sir." My head was swimming by this time and my stomach was nicely twisted on itself. The tension of waiting for my Father to pronounce judgement was unbearable. Thankfully, he was never one to mince words.

"是的，先生。" 此时我的头已经晕乎乎的，胃也紧紧地拧成了一团。等待父亲宣判的那种紧张感令人难以承受。幸好，他向来不是个拐弯抹角的人。

"I have wasted enough time on this matter. You are confined to your living quarters for one month, except when testing or on other NERV business. You are to receive no visitors in that time and your monthly stipend is also cut by two thirds for that period. The Second Child will bring home any schoolwork that you are required to complete so that you do not neglect your studies."

我已在这件事上浪费了太多时间。你将被限制在住处一个月，除非进行测试或处理其他 NERV 事务。在此期间，你不得接待访客，且你的月津贴也将削减三分之二。第二适格者会将你所需的学校作业带回家，以确保你不会荒废学业。

"Yes Sir." I gulped. "是的，先生。" 我咽了口口水。

"I have been very lenient with you this time Third Child. Do not disappoint me again or it will not go well with you. Understood?"

这次我对三儿你已经很宽容了。别再让我失望，否则对你没好处。明白了吗？

"Yes, Sir." 是的，先生。

"Dismissed." 解雇。

I bowed and staggered out of the office with my head spinning.

我鞠了一躬，头昏脑涨地踉跄着走出了办公室。

Misato and Asuka were waiting for me in the antechamber to my Father's office. Neither of them said a word to me, or each other as we made our way through the labyrinthine corridors of NERV to the employee car park. I climbed into the back of the ancient blue Alpine A310. Asuka, of course, took the front passenger seat. Misato climbed in, quickly gunned the engine and screeched off out of the car park and out onto the main road to the east.

美里和明日香在我父亲办公室的前厅等我。我们穿过 NERV 错综复杂的走廊前往员工停车场时，她们俩都没对我说一句话，彼此间也未交谈。我爬进了那辆古董蓝色阿尔派 A310 的后座。不出所料，明日香占据了前排乘客座位。美里上车后迅速发动引擎，尖锐地驶离停车场，向东边的主干道疾驰而去。

"Misato… "I attempted to say.

"Misato…" 我试图开口。

"Do not speak to me just yet, Shinji. We will talk about this when we get home."

现在还不要跟我说话，真嗣。我们回家后再谈这个。

Asuka still refused to even look at me.

明日香仍然拒绝看我一眼。

Needless to say, the rest of the ride home sucked.

不用说，回家的路上剩下的时间糟透了。

"Now. I want the truth, from both of you!"

现在，我要你们俩说实话！

Asuka and I sat across from Misato at the kitchen table. We had been ordered to sit there by our guardian as soon as we got home. Misato herself had changed out of her uniform and into her usual tank top and denim cut-offs. She had given Asuka a juice, me a glass of water and two paracetamol capsules, grabbed herself of Yebisu and sat down at the table.

明日香和我坐在厨房餐桌对面，与美里相对。我们一回到家，就被监护人命令坐在那里。美里已经换下了制服，穿上了她常穿的背心和牛仔短裤。她给明日香递了果汁，给我一杯水和两粒扑热息痛胶囊，自己则拿了一罐惠比寿啤酒，然后坐到了桌前。

"Well?" she said after neither of us answered her initial enquiry.

"怎么样？" 在我们俩都没有回应她的最初询问后，她说道。

"You heard the idiot, Misato! I stupidly agreed to go to the Arcade with him because he lied to me and now everyone's pissed off with me when I didn't do anything wrong!"

你听到了那个白痴的话，Misato！我愚蠢地同意和他去游戏厅，因为他对我撒了谎，现在我什么都没做错，大家却都对我生气了！

Misato took a swig of her beer.

碇真嗣喝了一大口啤酒。

"I'm not interested in the bullshit that you told the Commander. Tell me the truth. Now."

我对你们跟指挥官说的那些废话不感兴趣，告诉我真相，现在。

Asuka stood up, knocking her chair over as she did.

明日香站了起来，起身时不小心把椅子碰倒了。

"Fine!" she almost screamed the word. "Don't believe me! You always side with your precious little Shinji anyway! What's the big deal? We skipped school for one day! In case you haven't noticed we are fighting the entire Human Race's battles for them! I think that we deserve a little down time!"

"好极了！" 她几乎尖叫着说出这个词。"不相信我！你总是站在你那宝贝小真嗣一边！有什么大不了的？我们不过逃了一天学！你没注意到吗？我们正在为他们所有人战斗！我认为我们应该有点休息时间！"

"Sure Asuka, I agree." Misato said. "But not when it endangers all of Humanity. You know what would happen if that Angel had got through?"

"当然，明日香，我同意。" 美里说，"但不是在危及全人类的时候。你知道如果那个使徒突破了防线会发生什么吗？"

"But it didn't, did it? The Commander's precious little doll saved the day! So what's the big deal? Everyone's turning something minor into Chomolungma here!"

但它并没有，对吧？指挥官的宝贝小玩偶救了场！那又有什么大不了的？大家都在这里把小事夸大成珠穆朗玛峰似的！

Chomo-what-what? Asuka liked to show off her higher level of education, a lot.

千什么莫什么？明日香喜欢炫耀她更高水平的教育，而且经常如此。

Misato sighed. "That's not the point. You guys aren't normal teenagers. I wish that I could give you both a normal life, but I can't. It breaks my heart to see what you both have to go through. But these times aren't like any other in the History of the World. The survival of Humanity depends on you, for good or ill. If I could change that, I would. But I can't. You just aren't normal teenagers."

美里叹了口气：“问题不在这里。你们不是普通青少年。我真希望能让你们过上正常生活，但我做不到。看到你们必须经历的一切，我心都碎了。但这个时代在人类历史上是前所未有的。人类的存亡就寄托在你们身上，无论结果如何。如果我能改变这一点，我会的。但我做不到。你们终究不是普通青少年。”

I finally decided to speak. "Misato, we know that. It's just what Asuka is saying is… "

我终于决定开口了：“美里，我们明白的。只是明日香所说的……”

"Oh, shut up, Third!" Asuka rounded her anger on me. "I don't need you to speak for me, I don't want you to speak for me! You think that I'm such a useless little girl that I need a pathetic wimp like you to defend me? Well, fuck you! I don't want your help!"

“哦，闭嘴，第三！”明日香把怒火转向了我。“我不需要你替我说话，我也不想让你替我说话！你以为我是那么没用的小女孩，需要你这种可怜的懦夫来保护我吗？去你的！我不需要你的帮助！”

"Asuka!" Misato said angrily.

"明日香！" 惱怒地说道。

"No!" the redhead screamed. "I hate this place!" She threw the glass of juice at the sink, smashing it to pieces. "I hate all of you!"

"不！"红发女孩尖叫道，"我讨厌这个地方！"她将手中的果汁杯朝水槽扔去，砸得粉碎。"我讨厌你们所有人！"

She stormed out of the kitchen and into her bedroom, slamming the sliding door so hard it bounced back to halfway open again. Quickly she shut it again, firmly.

她怒气冲冲地从厨房冲进卧室，用力摔上推拉门，以至于门反弹到半开状态。她迅速再次将其关紧，动作坚决。

I got up, fetched the dustpan out of the cupboard and began cleaning up the shattered glass from around the sink.

我起床后，从橱柜里拿出簸箕，开始清理水槽周围碎裂的玻璃。

Misato sipped at her can of beer. "Shinji, I'm not trying to be an ogre here. It's just…"

葛城美里轻啜着她的啤酒罐。“真嗣，我不是想当个恶鬼。只是……”

"I know Misato. I'm sorry that we got you into trouble from the Commander. We… I just didn't think that things would go so badly."

我认识美里。很抱歉，我们让你因为指挥官而陷入麻烦。我们……我只是没想到事情会变得这么糟糕。

"I know that Shinji. You're a good person. You deserve better than I can give you. I know also that you're protecting Asuka from the consequences of her actions. She knows it too. That's why she's so angry. Not at you though. She's more angry at herself for feeling so weak and powerless. She… she's a complicated girl. Don't take this all to heart, Shinji. Promise me that?"

我知道你是真嗣。你是个好人。你应该得到比我所能给予的更好的。我也知道你在保护明日香，使她免受自己行为的后果。她自己也明白这一点。这就是她如此愤怒的原因。但不是对你，而是对她自己，因为她感到如此软弱无力。她……她是个复杂的女孩。真嗣，别太往心里去，答应我好吗？

I smiled, the movement painfully stretching the scab on my cheek. "I-I'll try Misato."

我笑了，这个动作让脸上的痂痛苦地拉伸着。“我……我会试试的，Misato。”

"Good boy… No, you're not a boy Shinji. You've proved yourself more of a man today than some I could think of. Now get yourself to bed, my wounded young man. You've had enough excitement for one day. I'll finish cleaning up here."

好孩子……不，你不是孩子，真嗣。你今天证明了自己比我想象中的某些人更像个男子汉。现在去睡觉吧，我受伤的小伙子。你今天的刺激已经够多了。我会在这里收拾完的。

I did as I was told. In my mind I can still see her to this day. Dustpan in hand, sweeping up the last of the broken glass, humming a quiet tune to herself. Misato Katsuragi. Guardian, commanding officer, tease, psychologist, foster-mother, friend.

我遵照吩咐行事。至今，我脑海中仍能清晰地浮现出她的身影：手持簸箕，扫起最后一片碎玻璃，轻声哼唱着小曲。葛城美里，既是守护者、指挥官，又是爱开玩笑的人、心理学家、养母和朋友。

I felt so unworthy of her.

我感到自己配不上她。

## Chapter 4 Propinquity 近亲

"Shit…. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit…. Fuck!"

该死…. 该死。该死。该死。该死。该死…. 操！

I've always found profanity a great comfort in difficult times. So it is no surprise, perhaps, that I was repeating this mantra over and over to myself. God-damn that Shinji! Thinking he could be the big man and take the blame for yesterday's debacle. I wasn't going to stand for it!

我总是在艰难时刻发现脏话能带来极大的慰藉。所以，我一遍又一遍地重复这句咒语也就不足为奇了。该死的真嗣！以为自己能当大人物，为昨天的灾难承担责任。我绝不会容忍这种事！

I kicked a stone along the street as I walked to Tokyo-3 Middle School. Fucking school! If it wasn't such a boring school then none of this would need to have happened! I was beside myself with fury at the way things had gone. There was no way I would forgive the pathetic Third Child for making me feel like this.

我一边沿着街道走向第三东京中学，一边踢着路上的石头。该死的学校！如果学校不是那么无聊，这一切本不需要发生！我对事情的发展感到无比愤怒。我绝不会原谅那个可怜的第三适格者让我有这种感觉。

Shinji, Shinji, Shinji! Arrgh! It was all his fault! Ever since I had arrived in this stupid City that boy had taken up far too much of my time and energy. Why I had thought that dragging that insipid lunkhead out for a day with the famous Asuka Soryu I was seriously beginning to question! And God help him if he thought I would be grateful to him for humiliating me like that. Bah! I had stormed out of the apartment this morning without even saying goodbye.

真嗣，真嗣，真嗣！啊！都是他的错！自从我来到这个愚蠢的城市，那个男孩就占用了我太多的时间和精力。我开始怀疑自己当初怎么会想到带那个无趣的傻大个和著名的惣流·明日香一起出去玩！如果他以为我会因为他那样羞辱我而感激他，那他可就大错特错了。哼！我今天早上怒气冲冲地离开了公寓，甚至都没说再见。

"Hey, Asuka!" 嘿，明日香！

I looked up from my sour musings. "Oh, hey Hikari." My best friend was standing at the gate of the entrance to the school. She fell into step beside me as we continued into the school buildings.

我从酸涩的沉思中抬起头来。“哦，嘿，光。”我的挚友正站在学校入口的门前。她与我并肩而行，一同走进校舍。

"Where's Shinji?" A look of concern crossed her face. "He wasn't injured in the Angel attack yesterday, was he?"

真嗣在哪儿？" 她脸上掠过一丝担忧。"他昨天在天使袭击中没有受伤吧？

I could feel my mouth twist bitterly. "That idiot? No… well, not really injured I guess…"

我能感觉到自己的嘴角苦涩地扭曲着。“那个白痴？不……嗯，应该说并没有真的受伤吧……”

Hikari's eyes widened. "He was hurt? How badly?" I had always suspected Hikari had a bit of a soft spot for Shinji. She was so soft-hearted, he was so soft headed. It made sense I guess. But she was too infatuated with that ape, Toji, to be any competit… ahem…

光的眼神瞪大了。“他受伤了？有多严重？”我一直怀疑光对真嗣有点心软。她心地太软，而他头脑太简单。我想这挺合理的。但她太迷恋那个笨蛋，东治，以至于无法成为任何竞争……呃……

"Not badly, just a couple of cuts and bruises. Nothing major. He did more harm to himself with his own idiocy."

不算严重，就几处擦伤和淤青。没什么大不了的。他自己愚蠢的行为反而伤得更重。

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Well, let's just say that you won't be seeing him for a while. He's basically under house arrest for a whole month for pissing off the Commander."

这么说吧，你暂时是见不到他了。他因为惹恼了指挥官，被软禁在家整整一个月。

"Oh, poor Shinji!" 哦，可怜的真嗣！

I shoved my bag into my locker. "Oh yes, 'Poor Shinji'" I said sarcastically. "Poor little precious Shinji-kun!" I couldn't keep the bitterness out of my voice.

我把书包塞进储物柜。“哦，是啊，‘可怜的真嗣’”我讽刺地说。“可怜的小宝贝真嗣君！”我的声音里藏不住苦涩。

"What happened Asuka?" Hikari said. "What did he do to make you so angry?"

发生了什么事，明日香？" 光说，"他做了什么让你这么生气？

Before I could answer the bell went to announce that the students had to be at their desks. Hikari had to be in the classroom to organise the students before the Sensei arrived. It was an undeniable Siren-Call to the Class Representative. 'Saved!' I thought thankfully to myself.

我还没来得及回答，铃声就响了，提醒学生们该回到座位上了。光得在教室里组织学生，等待老师到来。这对班长来说是无法抗拒的召唤。'得救了！' 我暗自庆幸。

"We'll talk about this later!" She called out as she scurried off to class 2-A.

"这事我们回头再聊！"她一边喊着，一边匆匆赶往 2-A 班。

"Damn, shit, shit, shit, shit, Fuck!"

该死，糟糕，糟糕，糟糕，糟糕，妈的！

"Shinji? Shinji! Talk to me Shinji! Don't you dare fucking die on me, Baka!"

真嗣？真嗣！跟我说话，真嗣！你敢就这样死了试试，笨蛋！

"Asuka? Asuka!" The urgently hissed whisper finally got through to me.

"明日香？明日香！" 那急切的低语终于传到了我的耳中。

"Wa… wake up Shinji…" I slurred blearily. Something hard and uncomfortable was pressed against my face.

"哇……醒醒，真嗣……" 我含糊不清地说着。有什么坚硬而不舒服的东西正压在我的脸上。

"Asuka!" The whisper was more insistent. There was also, more troublingly, some barely suppressed giggles in the background. My mind struggled back to consciousness. Only one place could be this uncomfortable.

"明日香！" 那低语愈发急切，更令人不安的是，背景中还隐约夹杂着几声强忍的窃笑。我的意识挣扎着回归清醒。只有一处地方能让人感到如此不适。

I opened my eyes and sat bolt upright in my seat. "Wha… Wassamatter?" I slurred, wiping a small snail-trail of drool off my chin.

我睁开眼睛，猛地坐直在座位上。“什…什么情况？”我含糊不清地说着，擦掉了下巴上一条细小的口水痕迹。

"Asuka!" Hikari hissed at me from the next desk. "You were sleeping, in class!"

"Asuka！" 光从邻桌低声对我说，"你居然在课堂上睡觉！"

I couldn't fault her there. I was definitely in Class 2-A, Tokyo-3 Middle School. The spine deforming uncomfortableness of the chairs. The pre-Impact desks and the incessant drone of the Sensei all confirmed this in my mind.

我无法在那里责怪她。我确实在东京第三中学的二年级 A 班。椅子那令人脊椎变形的难受感，前冲击时代的课桌，以及老师那不绝于耳的嗡嗡讲课声，这一切都在我脑海中证实了这一点。

"So what?" I shot back. "It's not like there's anything better to do!"

我反驳道：“那又怎样？又不是有更好的事情可做！”

Hikari looked aghast. She really needed to loosen up with this whole 'Class Representative' thing, in my opinion. She took it all far too seriously. My rest, as one of the saviours of Humanity, was far more important than some fossilised old prune's reminiscence about life in Kobe before Second Impact.

光看起来惊愕不已。在我看来，她真的需要放松一下，别把这“班长”的事儿看得太重。她对此太过认真了。作为人类救世主之一的我，休息远比某个老古董对第二次冲击前神户生活的回忆来得重要。

"But, Asuka…" She whispered. "You were calling out for Shinji!"

“但是，明日香……”她低声说，“你在呼唤真嗣！”

Oh… Crap… 哦……糟糕……

I remembered that I had been dreaming about being trapped under the rubble during the Angel battle of the day before. I had regained consciousness in the dusty and cramped space under the dumpster lid, which I remember was pressing so hard down onto my back. I recall seeing Shinji was pinned beneath me. The next thing that I had noticed was that my breasts were painfully squashed against his ribs. I was about to berate him about his perversion when I saw how still and pale he was. In the cramped space with its dusty filtered light I couldn't tell if he was even breathing. The painfully tiny confines had started to close in around me, I confess that I was beginning to panic. What if he was dead? What if I was trapped under an enormous pile of debris with a dead Shinji? A dead Shinji that I had never had a chance to… A scream began to build up within me, I remember shouting at him to wake up, or something like that. I tried to shake him but all I managed to do was create a choking shower of brick and concrete dust. I coughed, struggling to breathe when suddenly, Shinji obviously was alive because he tried to sit up and nearly gave me a serious concussion! Dear Lord that boy has a hard head! I could still feel the egg shaped lump from that impact sitting painfully just above my hairline.

我记得内心开始涌起尖叫，我朝他大喊，让他醒来，或者类似的话。我试图摇醒他，却只搅起了一阵令人窒息的砖块和混凝土灰尘。我咳嗽着，挣扎着呼吸，突然间，显然还活着的 Shinji 试图坐起来，差点给我造成严重的脑震荡！天哪，那孩子的头真硬！我还能感觉到撞击留下的鸡蛋大小的肿块，正痛楚地悬在我的发际线上方。

But anyway, back to that matter at hand. Hikari was still staring at me with a sly half grin on her face. "Well? What were you calling out Shinji's name for Asuka? What was he doing in your dreams? Hmm?"

但无论如何，回到手头的事情上。光仍然带着狡黠的半笑盯着我。“那么？你为什么在叫真嗣的名字，明日香？他在你的梦里做了什么？嗯？”

I shook my head, both to clear my still foggy brain and to answer her question.

我摇了摇头，既是为了清醒一下仍有些迷糊的大脑，也是为了回答她的问题。

"As if I'd dream about that moron! It sounds more like a freaking nightmare!" I had to nip this in the bud right away. Hikari was enough of a doe-eyed romantic, and not to mention read enough trashy novels, that she was always sure that 'Eva-Pilots-In-Love' was a mere eyelid flutter and soft-filtered lens shot away.

“我怎么可能梦到那个蠢货！这听起来更像是场该死的噩梦！”我得立刻掐灭这个苗头。光是个十足的纯情浪漫主义者，更别提她读了那么多庸俗小说，总是坚信“爱上 Eva 驾驶员”只需眨眨眼、用柔光滤镜一拍即合。

She sure had some funny ideas for such an apparently straight-laced girl. I don't even want to think about the secret stash of Shonen-Ai manga that I knew she kept hidden under her bed at home. It's always the quiet ones! Bleargh!

她确实对这样一个看似一本正经的女孩有着一些古怪的想法。我甚至不愿去想她在家中床下藏着的那些少年爱漫画的秘密藏匿处。总是那些安静的人！呸！

"Hmm…" She said unconvinced. "We're talking about this at lunch Asuka!"

"嗯……" 她半信半疑地说，"我们午饭时再谈这个，明日香！"

'Oh…. shit, shit, shit, shit, Fuck!'

哦……糟糕，糟糕，糟糕，糟糕，该死！

Let me just say this right from the get-go. Japanese school cafeterias suck.

我得一开始就直说，日本学校食堂真差劲。

All you ever get is rice. Rice with chicken. Rice with beef. Rice with pork. Rice with eel. Rice with tofu for crying out loud! Would it kill them to serve a Wiener schnitzel or sausage with potatoes once in a while? Seriously?

你永远只能吃到米饭。鸡肉米饭、牛肉米饭、猪肉米饭、鳗鱼米饭，甚至豆腐米饭！天哪！偶尔给他们上个维也纳炸肉排或香肠配土豆会要命吗？真的吗？

I took my tray of beef and rice in an indeterminate sauce to a vacant cafeteria table and sat down, muttering sour nothings to myself. In my annoyance I actually managed to snap the ridiculous disposable chopsticks they handed out in half just as Hikari pulled out the chair across from me and sat down.

我端着那盘浇着不明酱汁的牛肉米饭，走到食堂一张空桌前坐下，嘴里嘟囔着些酸溜溜的无聊话。在恼怒中，我竟真的将他们发放的可笑一次性筷子折成了两半，就在这时，光拉开我对面的椅子坐了下来。

"Why don't they give us forks like civilized human beings would use?" I asked testily, throwing the offending items across the table at her. She just grinned at me, damn her, and unwrapped her home made bento box provocatively in front of me.

"为什么他们不给我们像文明人那样使用的叉子呢？" 我气恼地问道，将那些碍眼的东西扔过桌子朝她甩去。她只是对着我咧嘴一笑，该死的，还故意在我面前挑衅地打开她自制的便当盒。

"Here," She said still smiling. "I always bring a spare." As she produced a plastic Spork from within the folds of her bento's wrapping and handed it to me.

"给，"她依然微笑着说，"我总是会多带一个。" 她从便当包裹的褶皱中掏出一个塑料勺叉，递给了我。

"Thanks." I said with minimal grace and immediately began to plough into my meal.

"谢谢。" 我带着最少的优雅说道，随即开始埋头享用我的餐点。

"So," Hikari said, daintily picking out some pickled vegetables from her bento box with her own lacquered chopsticks. "What's the deal with you and Ikari-kun?"

“那么，”光说着，用她那漆制的筷子优雅地从便当盒里夹出一些腌菜，“你和碇君之间是怎么回事？”

"Deal?" I replied through a mouthful of food. "There is no deal. There never was a deal. There never will be a deal."

"成交？" 我嘴里塞满食物回答道，"没有成交，从来就没有成交，以后也不会有成交。"

"Sorry, Asuka, I'm just not convinced."

对不起，明日香，我就是无法信服。

"Are you calling me a liar Horaki?" I said attempting to sound pissed off, not just nervous, as I really was.

"你是在说我是骗子吗，堀木？" 我试图让自己的语气听起来很生气，而不只是紧张，就像我实际上那样。

"No, not at all." She said primly. "I'm simply intrigued by your odd behaviour this morning is all."

"不，一点也不。" 她一本正经地说，"我只是对你今天早上的奇怪行为感到好奇罢了。"

I didn't answer, hoping she would take the hint and drop it. Not bloody likely.

我没有回答，希望她能领会暗示并就此打住。但这种可能性微乎其微。

"You were calling out his name in your sleep during class, Asuka."

你在上课时睡着了，嘴里还念着他的名字，飞鸟。

I just glowered at her.

我只是怒视着她。

"You were all like, "Don't die Shinji! Wake up Shinji! Don't leave me Shinji!" What is all of that about?"

你们都那样说：“别死啊，真嗣！醒醒，真嗣！别丢下我，真嗣！”这都是怎么回事？

"So, you were eavesdropping on me in class?" Sometimes the best defence is a good offence.

"所以，你上课时在偷听我说话？" 有时候，最好的防御就是有力的进攻。

"I would hardly class it as eavesdropping. You weren't exactly what I would call quiet about it. I mean not only I could hear it, Kotono, Megumi and Yuko all heard it too!"

我可不认为这是偷听。你那动静可真不小，我这么说吧，不仅我听见了，就连琴乃、惠和由子也都听到了！

The heat rushing to my face was the only answer I could give. Sadly it was far more honest than I wanted to be.

涌上面颊的热度是我唯一能给出的回答。遗憾的是，它远比我想要表现的更为诚实。

Hikari's eyes went wide at my blush. "Oh my God! What happened Asuka? Why weren't you and Shinji at school before the attack yesterday?"

光看到我脸红，眼睛瞪得大大的。“天啊！发生了什么，明日香？为什么你和真嗣昨天袭击前不在学校？”

"We're Pilots!" I tried to bluff my way out of it. "We had to be at NERV for, you know, testing and stuff!"

"我们是飞行员！" 我试图虚张声势蒙混过去。"我们得去 NERV，你知道的，为了测试之类的事！"

"Rei was at school before the attack, why wasn't she with you at NERV?"

"在袭击发生前，丽在学校，为什么她那时不在你身边，不在 NERV 呢？"

"I don't know!" I said, pushing my rice bowl away in frustration. Hikari was like a goddamned bull terrier. "Why don't you ask her?"

"我不知道！" 我沮丧地推开饭碗说道。光就像个该死的牛头梗。"你为什么不问她？"

"I did, yesterday morning when neither you nor Shinji showed up to class. She said that she was unaware of any tests scheduled for that day."

我确实问了，就在昨天早上，你和真嗣都没来上课的时候。她说她不知道那天有安排任何考试。

I slumped in my chair, defeated. "So?"

我瘫坐在椅子上，感到挫败。“然后呢？”

"So what happened?" 那么发生了什么事？

"Nothing happened!" "什么也没发生！"

"Asuka!" "明日香！"

I growled in frustration. "Fine! I asked that idiot if he wanted to spend the day with me, we went on a stupid picnic in the hills and got caught up in the Angel attack, and almost buried alive may I add, before clawing our way out only to find that fucking Wondergirl had beaten us to it and defeated the Angel without us!" I took a deep breath. "If that stupid idiot Shinji hadn't held me up I would have defeated that Angel and got the glory instead of that emotionless doll Ayanami!"

我懊恼地咆哮道：“好吧！我问那个白痴要不要和我一起过一天，我们去山里搞了个愚蠢的野餐，结果卷入了天使袭击，差点被活埋，我得说，我们好不容易爬出来，却发现那个该死的神奇女孩已经抢先一步，没等我们出手就打败了天使！”我深吸一口气。“如果不是那个蠢货真嗣拖我后腿，我本可以打败那个天使，获得荣耀，而不是那个毫无情感的人偶绫波！”

Hikari looked shocked at my outburst. "So, when you were calling out, don't die Shinji, you were… "

光对我的爆发感到震惊。“那么，当你呼喊着，不要死，真嗣，你是在……”

"Yes, that's right!" I snapped, interrupting her. "I was dreaming about being trapped under the rubble with Shinji!" I almost yelled, I could feel a prickling sensation beginning behind my eyes. "I actually thought that that stupid moron was dead for a moment there! You got that Hikari? Dead! What was I going to do without…." I stopped, but it was too late. My nails dug into the table top as I tried to hold it together. I was too afraid to even blink lest the tears I could feel building up in my eyes might flow over. Asuka Langley Soryu did not cry. Ever.

"对，没错！" 我厉声打断她，"我梦见和真嗣一起被困在废墟下！" 我几乎是在吼叫，我能感觉到眼后开始有刺痛感。"有那么一瞬间，我真以为那个蠢货死了！你明白吗，光？死了！没有他我该怎么办……" 我停了下来，但为时已晚。我试图保持镇定，指甲深深嵌入桌面。我连眨眼都不敢，生怕积蓄在眼中的泪水会决堤。惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不哭泣。永远不。

"Asuka." Hikari said quietly, placing her hand on mine. I felt too numb, too powerless to even remove it. "I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. But… S-Shinji's okay, right? You said you both got out okay?"

"明日香。" 光轻声说着，将手放在我的手上。我感到自己太过麻木，太过无力，甚至无法将手移开。"我……对不起。我不是故意要让你难过的。但是……真嗣他没事吧？你说过你们俩都安全出来了，对吧？"

"Yeah. We got out okay. The idiot got himself a black eye and nearly gave me a concussion when he finally woke up, but we got out okay."

是啊，我们安全出来了。那个笨蛋自己弄了个黑眼圈，他醒来时差点把我撞成脑震荡，但最终我们还是安全脱身了。

"Then… why are you so angry with him?"

那么……你为什么对他这么生气呢？

I sighed. "Because… because he's an idiot." I said without venom.

我叹了口气。“因为……因为他是个傻瓜。”我毫无恶意地说。

"Asuka!" "明日香！"

"Fine!" My resolve finally broken. "I'm pissed off with him because he tried to take the blame for the whole thing in front of Misato and the Commander! He told them that the whole thing was his idea, can you imagine how I felt?" I said indignantly. "That's right! Completely humiliated!"

"好极了！"我的决心终于崩溃了。"我对他感到愤怒，因为他试图在美里和指挥官面前为整件事承担责任！他告诉他们这一切都是他的主意，你能想象我当时是什么感受吗？"我愤愤不平地说。"没错！完全被羞辱了！"

"But, Asuka…" 但是，明日香……

"No, Hikari. I'm not some helpless little girl who needs big brave Shinji to protect me! He can't just sideline me like that. I… I won't stand for it!"

不，光。我不是那种需要勇敢的大真嗣来保护的无助小女孩！他不能就这样把我边缘化。我……我绝不容忍！

"Asuka. Why would Shinji want to take the blame for you? You've said yourself, what's the one thing that Shinji wants the most?"

明日香，为什么真嗣要为你承担责任呢？你自己也说过，真嗣最渴望得到的是什么？

"That's easy." I said. Not seeing the trap opening up wide in front of me. "He wants to be praised by his all-powerful Daddy! He practically rolls over and plays dead if his father even notices him. It's pathetic!"

“这太简单了。”我说道，却未察觉眼前正张开的陷阱。“他就是想得到无所不能的爸爸的夸奖！只要他父亲稍微注意到他，他简直就像翻肚皮装死一样。真可悲！”

"Sooo… He risked the thing he fears the most, his father's disapproval, to protect you from getting being punished? That so romantic!"

所以……他冒着最害怕的事情，也就是他父亲的反对，来保护你免受惩罚？这太浪漫了！

"Wha-what?" I was completely blindsided by Hikari's ability to see the merest thing as proof of budding romance. I was so shocked I was completely unaware of the sound of heavy, sneaker clad feet coming up from the direction of the lunch counter.

"啥？啥？" 我完全被光的能力惊到了，她竟能把最微不足道的事情视为萌芽爱情的证据。我震惊到连从午餐柜台方向传来的沉重运动鞋脚步声都浑然不觉。

"Don't be so dense Asuka!" Hikari said brightly. "There's only one reason that Shinji would put himself at risk for you. He cares about you Asuka! Isn't it obvious?"

"别这么迟钝了，明日香！" 光开朗地说道，"真嗣为你冒险只有一个原因，那就是他在乎你，明日香！这不是很明显吗？"

"Have you been sniffing the Whiteboard Markers or something?"

"你是不是在闻白板笔之类的东西？"

"Face it Asuka! He likes you! I mean it's been so obvious to everyone that he has had something for you for months now! You're both pilots, you train together, you live in the same apartment, he makes you lunch every day. It's inevitable that the two of you would fall in love!"

面对现实吧，明日香！他喜欢你！我的意思是，他对你的感情已经明显到所有人都能看出来，这种情况已经持续好几个月了！你们都是飞行员，一起训练，住在同一个公寓，他每天都给你做午饭。你们俩相爱是不可避免的！

"Are you insane?" "你疯了吗？"

"Come on, Asuka! I see the way you two look at each other, the whole class can see it! The only ones who seem blind to the fact that you two care deeply for one another is you and Shinji!"

来吧，明日香！我看得出你们俩彼此间的眼神，全班都看得出来！只有你和真嗣似乎对你们俩深切关心对方这一事实视而不见！

"She's right, you know, Demon-Girl." Suddenly Suzuhara slid down into the seat next to Hikari. Startling the bejesus out of me. "Sorry Class-Rep, I couldn't help overhearing some of what you were saying." He turned and looked at me from across the cafeteria table. "Shinji, the poor sap, is crazy about you, even I can see that! You know what else? I don't like it. Shinji's a sensitive guy, a good guy that deserves a lot better. 'Cos, you know what? Most of the time you treat him like something you just scraped off your shoe, even though it's clear to everyone that you like him."

"她说的没错，恶魔女孩。"突然，铃原滑到光旁边的座位上，吓了我一大跳。"抱歉，班长，我不小心听到了你们的一些谈话。"他转过头，隔着食堂的桌子看着我。"真嗣那可怜的家伙，对你可是痴心一片，连我都能看出来！还有，我不喜欢这样。真嗣是个敏感的好人，他值得更好的对待。因为，你知道吗？大多数时候，你对他就像是对待鞋底刮下来的脏东西，尽管大家都看得出你喜欢他。"

"Toji!" Hikari exclaimed.

"塔子!" 光惊呼道。

"Like I'm interested in the opinion of a dumb jock! Don't you have some place else to be right now? I'm sure that somewhere out there, a village is missing its idiot!"

就像我对一个蠢材的意见感兴趣似的！你现在不是应该在别的地方吗？我敢肯定，某个地方的村庄正在找它的傻瓜呢！

"Asuka!" Hikari exclaimed.

"明日香！" 光惊呼道。

"You! You're too busy being Queen Bitch Eva Pilot to give a nice guy like Shinji a break. Why don't you get off your high hobby-horse and look around you? No one else in this World would put up with your shit the way he does! One day I can only hope that he wakes up to see the bitch that you are and leaves you all on your own. God knows it's what you deserve!"

你！你太忙于当你的女王蜂 Eva 驾驶员，不给像真嗣这样的好人一点机会。为什么不从你的高傲马上下来，看看周围？这个世界上的其他人没有一个能像他那样忍受你的脾气！我只能希望有一天他能醒悟，看清你是个什么样的人，然后离开你，让你孤零零一个人。上帝知道这是你应得的！

"Toji!" Hikari exclaimed.

"东治！" 明日香喊道。

"Arrgh! I can't take any more of this!" I yelled, standing up abruptly and pushing the half-finished plate away from me. I stormed out of the cafeteria almost blindly, knocking over a dustbin as I blundered out. I didn't care, I just had to get out of there.

"啊！我再也受不了了！"我大喊一声，猛地站起来，把还没吃完的盘子推开。我几乎是盲目地冲出食堂，出门时撞翻了一个垃圾桶。我不在乎，我只想离开那里。

After lunch the school day dragged on and on, and on.

午饭后，学校的一天拖拖拉拉，没完没了。

The lowlight was probably the NERV Promotional Department DVD that the old Sensei showed during the middle of the afternoon. Eventually he managed to insert it into the player and then the old pre-Impact television that sat in the corner of the classroom took an age to warm up. Finally the class was subjected to NERV PR's latest atrocity:

最令人失望的可能是那位老教师在下午时分展示的 NERV 宣传部门 DVD。他费了好大劲才将其插入播放器，而教室角落那台老旧的、在冲击前生产的电视机则花了很长时间才启动。最终，全班被迫观看了 NERV 公关部门的最新劣作。

"Triumph of the Willing… Evangelion: The New Dreadnought and You."

意志的胜利……福音战士：新无畏舰与你。

The documentary opened with shots of the clouds above Tokyo-3, and then moved through the clouds to float above the assembling masses below, with the intention of portraying the beauty and majesty of the scene. The cruciform shadow of The Commander's plane was visible as it passed over the tiny figures marching below, accompanied by music from Richard Wagner's Die Valkyrie. Upon arriving at Tokyo-3 Airport, The Commander emerged from his plane to thunderous applause and a cheering crowd. He is then driven in an open top car into Tokyo-3, through equally enthusiastic people, to NERV Headquarters where a night rally is later held.

纪录片以东京-3 上空的云层镜头拉开序幕，随后穿云而过，悬浮于下方集结的人群之上，旨在展现场景的壮丽与庄严。指挥官座机的十字形阴影掠过下方行进的小小身影，伴随着理查德·瓦格纳的《女武神》音乐。抵达东京-3 机场后，指挥官步出飞机，迎接他的是雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼的人群。他随后乘坐敞篷车进入东京-3，沿途同样受到热情民众的欢迎，前往 NERV 总部，那里稍后将举行一场夜间集会。

How very Leni Riefenstahl.

真是太莱妮·里芬斯塔尔了。

As a proud German I found it all deeply offensive.

作为一名自豪的德国人，我觉得这一切都极其冒犯。

The rest of the video was a mish-mash of disinformation and 'Duck and Cover' condescension. The only one even vaguely interested was that pseudo-military nut-bar Aida.

视频的其余部分充斥着虚假信息和“躲避与遮掩”的居高临下态度。唯一稍感兴趣的是那个伪军事狂人艾达。

As for me, I just tried to sleep and not think about my conversation with Hikari at lunch. 'Eva pilots in love' it was like a bad soap opera on NHK Daytime or something.

至于我，我只是试图睡觉，不去想午餐时与光的那番对话。'恋爱的 EVA 驾驶员'，这简直像是 NHK 日间时段播放的劣质肥皂剧。

I didn't care about that baka! Did I? Why had I invited him out for the day yesterday then? Was it just boredom? I had planned the day and its picnic lunch for over a fortnight. Waiting until the weather and circumstances seemed just perfect to ask him.

我不在乎那个笨蛋！是吗？那为什么昨天我会邀请他出去玩一整天呢？仅仅是因为无聊吗？我为了那天的计划和野餐午餐准备了超过两周。等到天气和情况似乎都完美时才邀请他。

And what about that meathead Suzuhara? Where did he get off saying that I treated Shinji like dirt? I was the number one Evangelion Pilot. It was only natural and fitting that I behaved in a manner befitting my rank. Shinji knew that. Didn't he?

还有那个榆木脑袋的铃原是怎么回事？他凭什么说我对待真嗣像泥土一样？我是第一位的 EVA 驾驶员。以我的地位，自然应该有相应的举止。真嗣也明白这一点。不是吗？

As for our supposed 'Romantic' picnic… I needed a break from the city and its artificial surrounds and daily grind of school and training. That was all. Nothing more than that. I invited him along because I didn't want to go alone and I enjoyed his company…

至于我们所谓的“浪漫”野餐……我只是想逃离城市的喧嚣和人工环境，以及学校和训练的日常琐事。仅此而已，别无其他。我邀请他同行，是因为我不想独自前往，而且我喜欢有他相伴……

That was all there was to it. Wasn't it?

仅此而已，不是吗？

Who was I trying to convince? I for one was having a lot of trouble believing a word of it.

我究竟想说服谁呢？至少我自己是很难相信其中的任何一个字。

The film finally finished. Throughout the classroom students rubbed their bleary eyes and struggled back into seated positions. Before the old Teacher could bore us even more than we already were, the bell went to announce the end of the school day.

电影终于结束了。教室里的学生们揉着惺忪的眼睛，艰难地重新坐好。在老教师还没来得及让我们更加厌烦之前，放学铃声响起，宣告了一天的学校生活结束。

"Class dismissed." The Sensei droned.

"下课了。"老师拖着长音说道。

"Rise, Bow, Sit!" Hikari bellowed.

"起立，鞠躬，坐下！"光大声喊道。

The classroom quickly emptied of students, leaving only myself and Hikari, who was busy cleaning up the room. The air in the room was heavy and oppressive. The sky to the west was dark and threatening with the promise of a storm. I remained at my desk, head cradled in my hands. Still grappling with my own personal storm of emotions that the last few days had stirred up in me.

教室里的学生们很快就走光了，只剩下我和忙着打扫房间的 Hikari。房间里的空气沉重而压抑。西边的天空阴暗而充满威胁，预示着一场风暴即将来临。我依旧坐在桌前，双手托着头。仍在努力应对过去几天在我心中激起的情感风暴。

Finally I looked up.

最后，我抬头望去。

"Hikari?" I said. "光？" 我说。

"Yes Asuka?" My best friend answered.

"怎么了，明日香？" 我最好的朋友回答道。

"Am I really a bitch to Shinji?"

我真的对真嗣很刻薄吗？

"Don't pay any attention to Toji." She said kindly. "His heart is on the right place, he's just a bit over protective of Shinji because of, you know, how they met."

别理会东治。" 她温和地说，"他的心是好的，只是因为你知道的，他们相遇的方式，他对真嗣有点过度保护。

"You mean when he punched him?"

你是说当他打他的时候吗？

"Well, yeah. Toji has a strong sense of what's right. He still feels bad for how he treated Shinji all of those months ago. He just doesn't want to see his friend hurt is all."

嗯，是的。冬二有很强的正义感。他对几个月前对待真嗣的方式仍然感到难过。他只是不想看到自己的朋友受伤而已。

"How come you know so much about Toji Suzuhara suddenly?"

你怎么突然对铃原东治这么了解？

Hikari's cheeks coloured ever so slightly. "I'm the Class Representative. It's my duty to know about all of the students in the class."

光的脸颊微微泛红。“我是班长，了解班上所有同学是我的职责。”

She must have thought that I was as stupid as Suzuhara looked if she thought I bought that. But that wasn't of interest to me at that moment.

她肯定以为我和铃原一样蠢，才会认为我信了那一套。但那一刻，这对我来说并不重要。

"So, stop avoiding the question."

所以，别再回避问题了。

"Wha-What question, Asuka?"

什么问题，明日香？

"Am I a bitch to Shinji?"

我对真嗣很刻薄吗？

"Well…." Hikari suddenly seemed very interested in arranging the board erasers just right. "I would never use that word… And you are my best friend, so I know that you can be kind, sometimes… "

嗯……" 光突然对整理黑板擦变得非常感兴趣。"我绝不会用那个词……而且你是我最好的朋友，所以我知道你有时可以很善良……

I buried my head back in my hands. There's an old saying in English that I've heard, about being damned with faint praise. Using that analogy, Hikari was consigning my fate to the lowest circle of Hell.

我把头埋回双手中。英语里有句老话，我听说过，关于被微弱的赞美所诅咒。用这个比喻来说，光正将我的命运推向地狱最底层。

"So, in other words, yes." I muttered through my hands miserably.

"所以，换句话说，是的。" 我透过双手痛苦地低语道。

I could sense her coming closer as she walked across and lay a gentle hand on my hair. Hikari was really far too good to me. I had done nothing to deserve such a friend. I still miss her to this day. I know that she felt awful for upsetting me, but all she had really done was try to protect me. Protect me from seeing myself as others saw me.

我能感觉到她走近，穿过房间，轻轻地将手放在我的头发上。光对我实在是太好了。我没有什么值得拥有这样一个朋友的。至今我仍想念她。我知道她因为让我难过而感到难过，但其实她所做的只是试图保护我。保护我不以他人的眼光看待自己。

I had to keep it together. That hot prickling sensation behind my eyes was building again. Suddenly the heaviness of the air and the weight of years of suppression of emotion, suppression of need, reached an unbearable level in my heart. I felt I was being crushed beneath it all.

我必须保持镇定。那种眼睛后面火辣辣的刺痛感再次袭来。突然间，空气的沉重和多年来压抑情感、压抑需求的重量，在我心中达到了难以承受的程度。我感觉自己正被这一切压垮。

I had to get out of there. I stood up.

我必须离开那里。我站了起来。

"I gotta go Hikari!" I blurted out as I headed for the door.

"我得去找光了！" 我一边说着，一边朝门口走去。

"Asuka… " “明日香……”

I ignored my friends call and staggered out into the corridor. Fumbled with the combination on my locker, grabbed my bag and fled the school. I just wanted to get home. Home and safe.

我忽略了朋友的来电，摇摇晃晃地走出教室，来到走廊。摸索着打开储物柜的密码锁，抓起书包，逃离了学校。我只想回家，回到那个安全和温暖的地方。

I know that God definitely has a sense of theatre, because just as I left the school grounds the rain really started to fall in earnest.

我知道上帝肯定有戏剧感，因为就在我离开学校的那一刻，雨真的开始认真地下起来了。

I took my saturated shoes off at the entryway to the apartment. I didn't bother announcing my return home for the day. Misato was at NERV pulling another twenty hour shift in the wake of the last battle and Shinji… well that was all still a little too raw for me to think of right then. I made my way, dripping water off my sodden clothing all the while, from the entry and to the bathroom. Despite the earlier heat of the day, my wet clothes were now starting to chill my body through to the bone.

我在公寓入口处脱下了湿透的鞋子。懒得宣告我这一天的归来。美里在 NERV 又连续工作了二十个小时，以应对上一场战斗的余波，而真嗣……那时我还没准备好去想这些，感觉太痛了。我一路滴着水，湿漉漉的衣服不断滴水，从入口走到浴室。尽管白天很热，但湿衣服现在开始让我感到彻骨的寒冷。

Once in the bathroom I quickly stripped off my wet uniform and turned on the hot tap of the shower. The apartment's hot water service always took a couple of minutes to warm up. I stood there, waiting for it. The girl in the bathroom mirror stared back at me like a stranger. Standing there, naked, deathly pale with her red-rimmed eyes and her long red hair hanging in dark, lank strands over her bare shoulders.

一进浴室，我迅速脱掉湿透的制服，打开了淋浴的热水龙头。公寓的热水供应总是需要几分钟才能热起来。我站在那里等待着。浴室镜中的女孩像陌生人一样回望着我。她赤裸地站在那里，脸色苍白如死，红眼圈，长长的红发在暗淡无光的发丝中垂落在裸露的肩上。

Who are you? I thought.

你是谁？我暗自思忖。

Finally, mercifully, the image in the mirror was obscured by the rising steam from the shower cubicle. Adjusting the flow I stepped into the shower and let the streaming hot water warm me from the outside in.

最终，幸好，镜中的影像被淋浴间升腾的蒸汽所遮蔽。我调整了水流，踏入淋浴间，任由喷涌的热水由外至内温暖着我。

Who am I? The thought wouldn't leave me. My worries and cares weren't evaporating in the steam of the shower like they were supposed to. I worked my favourite Strawberry Balsam shampoo into my hair so vigorously I could actually feel my fingernails scratching at my scalp.

我是谁？这个念头挥之不去。我的忧虑和烦恼并没有像应该的那样，在淋浴的热气中消散。我用力地将我最喜欢的草莓香波揉进头发，以至于能真切地感受到指甲刮过头皮的感觉。

Who am I? No answer. Who was the Asuka that others saw? The high achieving, college graduate Evangelion Pilot? The child prodigy?

我是谁？没有答案。别人眼中的飞鸟又是谁？是成绩优异、大学毕业的福音战士驾驶员？还是那个神童？

The Bitch? A spoiled brat who pushed others away with her abrasive personality? A pride filled and abusive snob? That seemed far more likely to me. A sob escaped me, and then another. I tried to keep it under control, but my body refused to comply. My hitching breaths echoed sharply in the small bathroom, I only hoped that they weren't audible from outside. I didn't want Shinji to hear me cry.

那个贱人？一个被宠坏的顽童，用她那刺人的性格把别人推开？一个充满傲慢与暴虐的势利小人？这在我看来似乎更合情合理。我忍不住抽泣了一声，接着又是一声。我试图控制住自己，但我的身体却不听使唤。我那断断续续的呼吸声在狭小的浴室里回响得格外刺耳，我只希望它们不会从外面被听见。我不想让真嗣听到我哭泣。

Shinji… 真嗣……

What about Shinji? 真嗣呢？

The people around me, Misato, Hikari, Toji and Kensuke, even Wondergirl I'm sure, saw Shinji as a kind and considerate person, someone who was worth protecting. Was worthy of kindness. Someone who would be missed and grieved for if he was killed in the next Angel Battle.

我周围的人，如美里、光、东治和健介，甚至我相信连 Wondergirl 也不例外，都将真嗣视为一个善良体贴的人，一个值得保护的人。他值得被温柔以待。如果他在下一场天使之战中丧生，人们会怀念并哀悼他。

As for me? I doubt very much if any of them would care overly if I died tomorrow. Some of them might even be glad.

至于我呢？我非常怀疑，如果我明天死去，他们中是否有人会特别在意。有些人甚至可能会感到高兴。

I almost smiled to myself between sobs. I knew one person that would care. One person who miss me. One person who would mourn me, hold my name close and cherish my memory. Someone for whom my existence mattered.

我几乎在啜泣中对自己微笑。我知道有一个人会在乎。有一个人会想念我。有一个人会为我哀悼，紧握我的名字，珍藏我的记忆。有一个人，我的存在对他很重要。

Shinji. I startled myself by saying his name out loud.

真嗣。我被自己大声说出他的名字吓了一跳。

"Shinji." I said it again. Strangely, it made me feel a little better.

"真嗣。" 我又说了一遍。奇怪的是，这让我感觉好了一点。

"Shinji." My breathing began to come under control. I inhaled the steam filled air deeply.

"真嗣。" 我的呼吸开始逐渐平稳下来。我深深地吸了一口充满蒸汽的空气。

"Shinji." It was barely a whisper. But it brought me back to myself. To where I knew all along that I had to come. To a new resolution if you will. I gave myself a couple more minutes in the shower to rinse the shampoo from my hair. Then I turned off the water, briskly dried off with a towel before wrapping another fresh large red towel around my body.

"真嗣。" 那声音微弱得几乎听不见，却将我拉回了现实。回到我一直知道必须前往的地方，可以说是新的决心。我在淋浴间多待了几分钟，让水流冲去头发上的洗发水。随后，我关掉水龙头，迅速用一条毛巾擦干身体，再用一条干净的大红毛巾裹住自己。

My hand squeaked on the glass as I used it to wipe the condensation off the mirror and once again stare at the girl staring back out at me.

当我用手擦去镜子上的水汽，再次凝视着那个回望着我的女孩时，我的手在玻璃上发出了吱吱声。

I know you. I said to myself. The girl in the mirror smiled weakly back out at me.

我认识你。我对自己说。镜中的女孩向我投来一个虚弱的微笑。

I knew now what it was that I needed to do.

我现在明白了需要做什么。

The only worry I had now was, would I actually have the courage to do it?

我现在唯一的担忧是，我是否真的有勇气去做这件事？

## Chapter 5 Crossing the Rubicon 穿越卢比孔河

{Warning: Contains Lemon scene.}

{警告：包含柠檬场景。}

Was Asuka crying? 飞鸟在哭泣吗？

No… that was impossible. Asuka never ever cried. She was too strong, too proud to allow herself to give in to simple human emotions like that.

不…那是不可能的。明日香从不哭泣。她太坚强，太骄傲，不允许自己屈服于那种简单的人类情感。

There it was again. I could definitely hear it, coming from the apartment's bathroom. The sound of a hitched breath was clearly discernable over the running water of the shower. If that wasn't someone sobbing and trying to suppress the sound of their crying then I'm not sure what it was.

那声音又来了。我确实能听到，来自公寓的浴室。在淋浴的水声中，那哽咽的呼吸声清晰可辨。如果不是有人在哭泣并试图压抑声音，我不确定那是什么。

Was she really that pissed off with me?

她真的对我那么生气吗？

I was only trying to stop her and Misato from incurring my Father's wrath. I mean, he was always disappointed and annoyed with me, this latest debacle didn't really change any of that much from my perspective. I just had figured that why should they have to suffer at his hands as well? I swear I wasn't trying to upstage her or marginalise either of them in any way.

我只是想阻止她和美里惹怒我父亲。我的意思是，他总是对我失望和恼火，这次最新的混乱从我的角度来看并没有太大改变。我只是觉得，为什么她们也要遭受他的怒火呢？我发誓，我并不是想抢她的风头或边缘化她们中的任何一个。

I sighed and rubbed my eyes. No matter what I seemed to do back in those days, it only ever made things worse.

我叹了口气，揉了揉眼睛。无论那时我做什么，似乎都只会让情况变得更糟。

Eventually, I knew, this silent treatment from Asuka would stop. She would yell and scream at me, I would apologise, she would yell some more and then, hopefully, my life would begin to return to something resembling normal.

我知道，总有一天，明日香这种沉默的态度会停止。她会对我大喊大叫，我会道歉，她会继续吼叫，然后，希望我的生活能开始恢复到某种类似正常的状态。

Then all I had to do was get through this month of confinement in the apartment, and I could see my friends again. That would be nice. Although, to tell the truth, one month alone was not something that really bothered me. I had got used to being alone when I had lived with my old Teacher. He was a kindly, but distant old man who didn't really have a lot to say to an awkward and not terribly academically inclined youth like me.

接下来我只需熬过这个月在公寓的隔离期，就能再次见到我的朋友们了。那将会很美好。不过说实话，独自一人待上一个月对我来说并不算什么困扰。我早已习惯了独处，就像我与那位老教师同住时一样。他是个和蔼却疏离的老人，对于像我这样笨拙且学业平平的年轻人，他并没有太多话要说。

The silence of solitude did get to me sometimes, but my trusty old SDAT managed to keep the worst of my anxieties at bay. Most of the time.

孤独的寂静有时确实会让我感到压抑，但我的老伙伴 SDAT 总能帮我抵挡住最严重的焦虑。大多数时候都是如此。

I heard the shower stop. Asuka would be coming out soon. This would be a test of her ability to not speak to me. I hadn't really left my room at all that day. I was still in my old t-shirt and shorts that I had spent the whole afternoon in. I hadn't even prepared any kind of dinner or anything like that. It was all a part of my plan, you see. Once Asuka saw that there was no food ready for her, then she would probably come and yell at me to make her some dinner. If she came and yelled at me then she would finally be speaking to me. Once that silence between us was broken then things would return to a more normal footing and life would become more bearable once again.

我听到淋浴声停了，明日香应该很快就会出来。这将是对她能否不与我交谈的一次考验。那天我几乎没有离开过我的房间，仍然穿着整个下午都在穿的那件旧 T 恤和短裤。我甚至没有准备任何晚餐或类似的东西。你看，这都是我计划的一部分。一旦明日香看到没有为她准备食物，她很可能会过来对我大喊大叫，让我给她做晚饭。如果她来对我大喊大叫，那么她终于会和我说话了。一旦我们之间的沉默被打破，事情就会回到更正常的立足点，生活也会再次变得更能忍受。

As plans go it might sound pathetic, but I was pretty confident that it would work. You see I just couldn't bear it if Asuka wouldn't talk to me. Even if all that she called me was 'Baka'. That was enough.

就计划而言，这听起来可能很可悲，但我相当有信心它会奏效。你看，如果明日香不和我说话，我就无法忍受。即使她只是叫我'笨蛋'，那也足够了。

At the sound of the bathroom door opening I rolled over instinctively on the bed, my back to the door. If I had calculated correctly then she would be coming through that door in but a few short minutes to berate me for my laziness in allowing the Great Asuka Langley Soryu to starve. If I pretended to be asleep then I was in a better defensive posture for any assault that might come.

听到浴室门打开的声音，我本能地在床上翻了个身，背对着门。如果我算得没错，那么她很快就会穿过那扇门，因为我让伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷挨饿而责骂我。如果我装睡，那么在可能到来的攻击面前，我就能处于更有利的防御姿态。

My bedroom door slid open, far sooner than I had anticipated. Butterflies fluttered violently in my stomach. This was definitely going to be a big one if she was at my door so quickly. I tried my best to appear to be asleep.

我的卧室门突然打开了，比预料的要早得多。我的心怦怦直跳，如果她这么快就来到我的门前，那肯定是大事。我尽力装作睡着的样子。

So far my plan, such as it was, was going along nicely. I knew that I just had to brave the coming verbal assault and then Asuka would have it out of her system. The tension in the apartment would dissipate and my life would return to its safe, humdrum, routine.

到目前为止，我的计划虽然简单，但进展顺利。我知道只需勇敢面对即将到来的言语攻击，之后明日香就能发泄完毕。公寓里的紧张气氛将会消散，我的生活也将回归到安全、平淡、规律的常态。

Silence. I knew that she was there, I could almost feel her presence watching me from the doorway. After what seemed like an age I could hear her soft footfalls coming towards me across the carpet. I braced myself. Unexpectedly there was a light whump and the unmistakeable feeling of a weight landing on the bed behind me.

寂静无声。我知道她就在那里，几乎能感受到她从门口注视着我的存在。仿佛过了许久，我终于听到她轻柔的脚步声穿过地毯向我靠近。我做好了准备。突然间，传来一声轻微的“噗”声，紧接着是身后床上落下一物体的明显感觉。

Then nothing. I could feel her sitting there. I could hear her breathing. The scent of her Strawberry Balsam shampoo enveloped me. But that was it. Nothing else happened for what felt like an hour, though it probably was no more than five or six minutes. I lay as still as I could and waited. What else could I do?

然后就什么也没有了。我能感觉到她坐在那里。我能听到她的呼吸声。她草莓香波的香味包围着我。但也就仅此而已。感觉像过了一个小时，但实际上可能只有五六分钟。我尽可能地躺着不动，等待着。我还能做什么呢？

A hand was gently placed on my shoulder.

一只手轻轻地放在了我的肩上。

"Shinji?" Asuka's voice was soft, barely above a whisper. I was so taken aback that I still didn't move.

"真嗣？"明日香的声音很轻，几乎只是耳语。我太过惊讶，以至于仍然一动不动。

"Shinji… I know that you're awake."

真嗣……我知道你醒着。

"Uh… Umm… Hi Asuka." I said, still keeping my back to her.

“呃… 嗯… 你好，明日香。”我说道，依旧背对着她。

"Look at me Shinji." She said with a small sniff.

"看着我，真嗣。" 她轻吸了一下鼻子说道。

I turned over to face her, prepared for anything, I thought. I was wrong. I was definitely not prepared for what I saw.

我翻身面对她，自以为做好了万全准备。我错了。我绝对没有准备好面对我所看到的。

Asuka sat on the side of my bed, only a red towel wrapped around her, tied just above her breasts and finishing at her upper thighs. Her still damp hair hung in unkempt strands around her face and down to her bare shoulders. Her eyes… her red rimmed eyes seemed to glisten with moisture in the light that shone in through the bedroom window.

明日香坐在我的床边，身上只裹着一条红色的毛巾，在胸部上方打结，垂至大腿上部。她那还带着湿气的头发凌乱地披散在脸庞周围，垂落到裸露的肩头。她的眼睛……那双红眼圈的眼睛，在卧室窗户透进的光线下，似乎闪烁着湿润的光芒。

She was so beautiful it almost made me ache with longing just to touch her. To hold her. To comfort her. Though I knew that I was too much of a coward to ever actually do it.

她美得令人心痛，我渴望触碰她、拥抱她、安慰她，尽管我知道自己太过懦弱，永远不敢付诸行动。

"Shinji…" "真嗣……"

"Yeah." 是的。

"Ca-can, can we talk?" "能、能谈谈吗？"

"Uh-huh." 嗯哼。

She smiled at me for a moment. Then her face grew serious again. "Shinji, do… do you think that I'm a bitch?"

她朝我微笑了一瞬，随后神情又严肃起来。“真嗣，你……你觉得我是那种坏女人吗？”

Of all the things I had expected, this wasn't even close.

在我预料的所有事情中，这甚至都不沾边。

"No." I shook my head.

"不。" 我摇了摇头。

"Why not?" 为什么不呢？

I was really confused. "What do you mean Asuka?"

我真的很困惑。“明日香，你是什么意思？”

"You know!" she said less gently. "A bitch. A bossy, violent, evil unlovable bitch!"

“你知道的！”她不那么温和地说，“一个泼妇。一个专横、暴力、邪恶、不讨人喜欢的泼妇！”

Had the World ended and been replaced by a weird alternate reality without me noticing? "No Asuka! You're none of those things! You're strong, you're independent, you-you're intelligent, you're fearless, and you're popular. I wish that I could be half of the things that you are Asuka!"

世界是否已经终结，被一个我未曾察觉的诡异平行现实所取代？“不，明日香！你绝非那些东西！你坚强，你独立，你聪明，你无所畏惧，你还很受欢迎。真希望我能拥有你一半的优点，明日香！”

She shook her head, showering me with droplets of water from her still wet hair. "No, Shinji-kun." She said, a single teardrop spilling delicately from her eyes and rolling down her cheek. "I'm all of those things. You're the only one who seems to see past the ugliness that is me and find something better. And how do I thank you for it? I treat you like garbage, that's how." Another tear followed the first. "I… I-I'm so sorry Shinji." She sniffed. She bowed her head, seemingly unable to say anything more.

她摇了摇头，湿漉漉的头发洒落水珠在我身上。“不，真嗣君。”她说着，一滴泪珠从她眼中精致地溢出，顺着脸颊滑落。“我就是那样的人。只有你看透了我丑陋的本质，发现了更好的东西。而我又是如何感谢你的呢？我把你当垃圾对待，这就是我的方式。”另一滴泪紧随其后。“我……我真的很抱歉，真嗣。”她抽泣着。她低下头，似乎再也说不出更多的话来。

I was shocked. Ugliness? "Ugliness? Asuka… I-I don't understand. How can you think that? You-you're the most beautiful person I know. I… " I trailed off. Had I just told the Great Asuka Langley Soryu that I thought she was beautiful? Surely swift death awaited me.

我震惊了。丑陋？“丑陋？明日香…我-我不明白。你怎么会这么想？你-你是我认识的最美的人。我…”我话音渐弱。难道我刚刚告诉了伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷我认为她很美吗？无疑，我即将面临迅速的死亡。

"No, I'm ugly!" she yelled, tears now streaming down her cheeks. "My heart is ugly and black and filled with hate and anger. No one can stand to be around me for long! Everyone leaves me, everyone abandons me! Even my own Mother… Everyone! You know what? I don't even blame them! I can't stand myself most of the time… You… even you'll leave me Shinji. I know it."

“不，我很丑！”她哭喊着，泪水顺着脸颊流淌。“我的心丑陋、黑暗，充满了仇恨和愤怒。没有人能忍受长时间和我在一起！每个人都离开我，每个人都抛弃我！就连我自己的母亲……每个人！你知道吗？我甚至不怪他们！大多数时候，我自己都受不了自己……你……连你也会离开我，真嗣。我知道的。”

"Never…" I said, shaking my head.

"从未……" 我摇着头说。

"Bullshit Shinji! Why the fuck would you stay? I treat you like shit, all of the time! I'm mean, I'm spiteful and nasty… Nobody would… "

"胡扯，真嗣！你他妈为什么要留下？我总是把你当垃圾对待！我刻薄、恶毒又可憎……没人会……"

"No!" I interrupted angrily. "You'rethe one that's talking bullshit Asuka!" My more meek instincts overpowered by the sheer shock of hearing Asuka talk like this. "You're the most popular person I know, people flock to you because you're beautiful, you're charismatic, you're intelligent! Compared to you I'm just a nobody Asuka! And as long as you can tolerate having a sap like me around, I'm not going anywhere!"

"不！" 我愤怒地打断她，"胡说八道的是你，明日香！" 听到明日香这样说话，我那原本温顺的本能被彻底震惊所压倒。"你是我认识的最受欢迎的人，人们因为你美丽、有魅力、聪明而聚集在你身边！和你相比，我不过是个无名小卒，明日香！只要你还能忍受我这样的傻瓜在身边，我就不会离开！"

Her eyes widened in shock at my tone, before her face became unreadable as I went on. After I finished my speech she was quiet for several minutes. Finally she spoke.

她听到我的语气，眼睛惊讶地睁大了，随后在我继续说话时，她的表情变得难以捉摸。我讲完后，她沉默了几分钟。最终，她开口了。

"People only hang around me 'cos I'm a Pilot and I'm foreign and I talk big. They don't really know what I'm like, and they don't care. I'm just a rung up the school popularity ladder to most of them.

人们之所以围着我转，只是因为我是个飞行员，是个外国人，而且我说话口气大。他们并不真正了解我是怎样的人，也不在乎。对大多数人来说，我只是学校人气阶梯上的一级罢了。

"Not to me Asuka. I know you better than they do, and I promise you I will never abandon you!"

不是对你，明日香。我比他们更了解你，我向你保证，我永远不会抛弃你！

She just stared at me, her eyes almost impossibly blue against the redness of her tear stained cheeks. The only sound was the ubiquitous droning of the cicadas outside of the apartment building.

她只是盯着我，泪痕斑斑的脸颊映衬下，她的眼睛蓝得几乎不可思议。唯一的声音是公寓楼外无处不在的蝉鸣。

She eventually rubbed her eyes with the heels of her palms and smiled at me. "Beautiful, huh?" She said softly.

她最终用掌根揉了揉眼睛，然后朝我微笑。“很美，对吧？”她轻声说道。

All I could do was nod solemnly. The silence between us hung heavy in the room

我所能做的只是郑重地点头。我们之间的沉默在房间里显得格外沉重。

"So…" She said after a moment's further pause. "D-do you wanna kiss me?"

“所以……”她稍作停顿后说道，“你……你想吻我吗？”

Suddenly the room seemed to become infinitely quieter. "Kiss…" I tried to say, but the power of speech had deserted me temporarily.

突然间，房间似乎变得异常宁静。“亲吻…”我试图说出口，但一时间竟失去了言语的能力。

"Well?" She said, her voice trembling slightly. "Do you…?"

"嗯？" 她问道，声音微微颤抖。"你……？"

I remember just nodding dumbly.

我记得只是呆呆地点了点头。

"Alright then." She said, standing up from the side of the bed. "I'm not coming down there to you! Get up here in front of me!"

"那好吧。" 她说着，从床边站起身来。"我不会下去找你的！快上来站在我面前！"

I got up off the bed and stood facing her. A few awkward seconds followed as we stared at each other.

我从床上起身，站在她面前。我们互相凝视着，尴尬的几秒钟随之而来。

"Well, Third Child!" She said in mock seriousness. "Are you going to just stand there like a startled bonobo, or are you going to put your arms around me?"

"哎呀，三娃子！" 她故作严肃地说，"你是打算像只受惊的倭黑猩猩那样站在那儿，还是打算抱抱我呢？"

I reached out and put me arms around her upper body. The bare skin of her back felt cool and soft to the touch. A few wet strands of her hair hung over my fingers. Her arms clasped themselves around my torso and pulled me forward. We stared at each other. Eyes locked.

我伸出手，将双臂环绕在她上半身。她裸露的背部肌肤触感凉爽而柔软。几缕湿润的发丝垂落在我的手指上。她的手臂环抱住我的躯干，将我拉向前。我们凝视着彼此，目光紧紧相扣。

"Okay…" She breathed. "Here I come."

"好的…" 她深吸一口气。"我来了。"

After an initial clash of teeth we both pulled back a little before leaning forward again. Her lips were so soft and her scent was so intoxicating. The closeness and touch sent little electric bolts of pleasure into my awestruck brain. After just a few seconds we broke off the kiss and just looked at each other, our arms still interlocked.

初次牙齿碰撞后，我们俩都稍稍后退，随后又倾身向前。她的双唇柔软至极，她的香气令人陶醉。那份亲近与触碰，在我惊叹的大脑中激起阵阵愉悦的电流。仅仅几秒后，我们结束了这个吻，只是彼此凝视，手臂依旧交缠。

"Was… was that your first one?" She asked me.

"那是你的第一次吗？" 她问我。

I nodded. "You?" 我点了点头。“你呢？”

"Yeah." She said, her sapphire blue eyes locked on my own. She closed them and leaned her head forward. I followed suit and once again our lips met. This may only have been the second ever kiss for both of us, but Asuka definitely took to it with enthusiasm. Her lips and mine intertwined and moved against each other. I was just trying my best just to keep up with her. I could feel her tongue playing along my own as our hands moved as if of their own will across the backs of each other's bodies.

"嗯。" 她轻声回应，那双蓝宝石般的眼睛紧紧盯着我。她闭上眼，将头微微前倾。我亦随之倾身，我们的唇再次相遇。尽管这或许只是我们彼此间的第二次亲吻，但明日香显然投入了极大的热情。我们的唇瓣交织缠绵，相互摩挲。我竭尽全力，只为跟上她的节奏。我能感受到她的舌尖在我的舌上轻舞，而我们的手仿佛有了自主意识，在彼此的背上游走。

I was surely in some kind of heaven. To be in the arms of, and kissing this beautiful girl was not something that was meant for the likes of me, surely. Nothing in my life had prepared me for the rush of pleasure, of sheer unadulterated joy that that second kiss sent surging through my teenaged body. My brain was on endorphin overload. It made me feel brave, perhaps foolishly so. Finally, sadly from my perspective, Asuka pulled back and we were once again entwined in each other's arms, standing in the middle of my small bedroom, faces mere millimetres apart.

我肯定置身于某种天堂。被这位美丽的女孩拥入怀中、亲吻，这显然不是为我这样的人准备的。我生命中的一切都未曾为那一刻的亲吻所带来的快感、纯粹无瑕的喜悦做好准备，它如潮水般涌过我年轻的身体。我的大脑处于内啡肽的过载状态，让我感到勇敢，或许还有些愚蠢。最终，从我的角度来看，令人伤感的是，明日香退后了一步，我们再次紧紧相拥，站在我狭小的卧室中央，脸庞仅相隔几毫米。

"I love you Asuka." I said, without even thinking. My feelings needed a voice, and I gave into them without care for the consequences.

"我爱你，明日香。" 我脱口而出，未经思索。我的情感需要表达，我便不顾后果地倾诉了。

Asuka's eyes widened and she loosened her grip on me and stepped back. Panic clawed at my stomach as a sinking feeling took the strength out of my legs and I collapsed backwards and ended up seated back on the edge of my bed. I looked up in fear at Asuka. I had gone too far, I knew it. 'Idiot' I thought. How could I have been so stupid as to let my runaway emotions ruin the single most beautiful moment of my life?

明日香的眼睛睁大了，她松开了对我的抓握，向后退了一步。恐慌像爪子一样抓挠着我的胃，一种下沉的感觉夺走了我双腿的力量，我向后倒下，最终坐在床边。我害怕地抬头看向明日香。我知道，我做得太过分了。'白痴'，我心想。我怎么能让失控的情绪毁掉我生命中最美好的瞬间呢？

Asuka just stood there, still in her red towel. Her head bowed so that her hair shadowed the top half of her face. Her expression, or what I could see of it, was heartbreakingly forlorn.

明日香就那样站在那里，依旧裹着她的红毛巾。她低着头，让头发遮住了脸的上半部分。她的表情，或者说我能看到的那部分，是令人心碎的孤寂。

"A-Asuka, I… I'm sorr…"

"飞鸟，我……我真的很抱歉……"

"Don't" She said in a soft, sad voice. "Don't you dare say that you're sorry Shinji."

"别说了。" 她用柔和而悲伤的声音说道，"你不许说对不起，真嗣。"

I sat there and stared at her.

"Don't you say sorry for saying that, not if you really meant it." She said. Finally she looked up at me, tears tracked down her face. "Do you really mean it Shinji?"

"你不必为此道歉，如果你是真心这么想的话。"她说道。最终她抬头看向我，泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落。"你真的这么想吗，真嗣？"

"Asuka… " “明日香……”

"Do you mean it?" She said, more forcefully.

"你是认真的吗？" 她更加有力地说道。

I gulped. "Y-Yes." 我倒吸一口凉气。“是-是的。”

"Why?" 为什么？

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"Why do you love me, baka?" She almost was shouting now. "Why? I'm just a bad tempered, self-centred bitch!"

"你为什么爱我，笨蛋？" 她几乎是在喊叫。"为什么？我只不过是个脾气暴躁、自私自利的贱人！"

Oh boy, this was really turning into an emotional boner coaster here.

哎呀，这真是变成了一场情感的过山车。

"You might feel that way Asuka. I-I can't help what you feel um… I want you… uh… "I stumbled over my words at the worst possible time. Despite herself Asuka smiled at my discomfiture.

你可能会那样觉得，明日香。我……我无法左右你的感受，嗯……我想要你……呃……"在最糟糕的时刻，我结巴了。尽管她自己也不情愿，但明日香还是因为我的窘迫而笑了。

"Yeeees, Shinji-kun?" "是的，真嗣君？"

"I-uh, want you to uh… feel… "Oh crap, I was completely losing my train of thought as she kept staring at me, a half smile now on her lips.

"我-呃，想让你呃…感受…"哦糟糕，她一直盯着我看，我完全忘了自己要说什么，她嘴角挂着半抹微笑。

I sighed. I couldn't win. "It's true. I love you Asuka. I have for a long time now. I can't see you the way you describe yourself. All-All I can ask is of you is that you believe me when I say it." I swallowed loudly. These big emotional scenes were never my thing and I really couldn't believe just how corny I actually sounded. I had meant every syllable I had said, right from the bottom of my aching heart. I just couldn't hope to match the depth of my feelings with the ineffectualness of my words.

我叹了口气，知道自己赢不了。“是真的，我爱你，明日香。这份感情已经持续很久了。我无法像你描述的那样看待你。我所能请求的，只是你相信我此刻的话语。”我大声地咽了口唾沫。这种大场面的情感戏从来不是我的强项，我真不敢相信自己听起来有多么俗套。我所说的每一个字都发自内心深处，那份痛楚无法言喻。我只是无法用言语的无力来匹配我情感的深邃。

The heady buzz from the kissing was starting to grow steadily colder under her scrutiny. I just hoped that I hadn't ruined everything with my bone-headed ramblings, because I would do anything for her to kiss me like that again.

在她审视的目光下，亲吻带来的陶醉感正逐渐冷却。我只希望自己那些愚蠢的胡言乱语没有毁掉一切，因为我愿意做任何事，只为再次体验她那样的吻。

The smirk slowly left her face and she stared down at me for a few seconds longer. Her expression now completely unfathomable.

那抹冷笑缓缓从她脸上消失，她又多盯了我几秒钟。此刻，她的表情已完全难以捉摸。

Her hands reached out and stroked my face gently. I sat transfixed as she slowly bent down and kissed me once again on the lips. Just a gentle kiss, no tongue, no force, just a long soft and totally heavenly kiss that raised goose bumps all over my body and sent waves of joy throughout every fibre of my being.

她的双手伸过来，轻柔地抚摸着我的脸颊。我坐在那里，一动不动，她缓缓俯下身，再次吻上了我的唇。那是一个温柔的吻，没有舌头的纠缠，没有力量的压迫，只是一个绵长、柔软、完全如天堂般的吻，让我的全身都起了鸡皮疙瘩，每一丝存在都充满了喜悦的波澜。

Finally, she broke off the kiss. "I believe you." She breathed. I just nodded silently at her. "Promise me that you'll never leave me?"

"Asuka, I…" “明日香，我……”

"Promise me! Promise me that you'll never abandon me Shinji! Promise me that and I… I swear that I'll be yours forever."

答应我！答应我你永远不会抛弃我，真嗣！答应我这一点，我发誓我将永远属于你。

"I promise Asuka! I would never abandon you, no matter what happened!"

我向明日香保证！无论发生什么，我永远不会抛弃你！

"You mean it?" “你是说真的吗？”

"I promise I will never leave you. I-I swear it on my Mother's…"

我承诺，我永远不会离开你。我，我以我母亲的名义发誓……

"Don't." She put a finger on my lips. "Don't."

"别说了。" 她将一根手指轻放在我的唇上。"别说了。"

I hung my head. Cursing myself for the awkwardness I had brought back to this moment. I couldn't meet her eyes as I inwardly lectured myself on not fucking up this most beautiful moment in my life. I stared unconsciously at the area where the top of her breasts met her towel, without thinking taking in the alluring way the curve continued past the top of the red towelling, bulging out to give a suggestion of the roundness and shape of those breasts before tapering down into her shapely waist and back out with the curves of her hips. I wasn't even aware I was doing it, it was just my mind, and hormones, on autopilot. Until…

我垂下头，暗自咒骂自己将尴尬带回了这一刻。我无法直视她的眼睛，内心严厉告诫自己不要毁掉这生命中最美好的瞬间。我无意识地凝视着她胸前毛巾交界处，思绪不由自主地捕捉到那曲线如何越过红色毛巾的边缘，微微隆起，暗示着胸部的圆润与形状，随后向下收束至她纤细的腰肢，再向外延展出她臀部的曲线。我甚至未察觉自己在这样做，一切只是心智与荷尔蒙在自动驾驶下的本能反应。直到……

"Ahem… My eyes are up here!"

"咳咳……我的眼睛在这儿呢！"

I could feel the heat rushing up to my face. "I… I…"

我能感觉到热气直冲脸颊。“我……我……”

Asuka's smile was bright and genuine at my embarrassment, but there was also something else behind it that I just couldn't read.

在我尴尬时，明日香的笑容既明亮又真诚，但背后似乎还隐藏着某种我无法解读的东西。

"So, Shinji-kun, you like what you see?"

那么，真嗣君，你喜欢你所看到的吗？

Too scared to answer I just nodded, blushing.

太害怕回答，我只是点了点头，脸红了。

"This towel," She said holding the top seam of the material. "Is the Impenetrable Wall of Jericho, Third Child! Do you know what that means?"

"这条毛巾，"她边说边抓住布料的顶端缝合处，"就是耶利哥的坚不可摧之墙，第三个孩子！你知道那意味着什么吗？"

She had used this analogy on me before. "It means… it…it cannot be breached?" I said, confused by where this was going. Asuka surprised me, again, by laughing out loud.

她之前就用这个比喻跟我解释过。“这意味着……它……它无法被突破？”我说道，对这走向感到困惑。明日香又一次让我惊讶，她大声笑了出来。

"No you dunderhead! Don't you know anything about what actually happened to the Walls of Jericho?"

不，你这个糊涂虫！你难道对耶利哥城墙究竟发生了什么一无所知吗？

I shook my head, bewildered beyond belief by the circles that this girl could run around me.

我摇了摇头，难以置信地被这个女孩绕得团团转。

She paused for a short moment, "Then allow me to show you, Shinji-kun!" With just a moments hesitation she tugged on the knot on the top of it and the towel promptly dropped to the floor at her feet, leaving her standing naked, hands on her hips and a slight but endearing blush on her cheeks, in the middle of my bedroom.

她停顿了片刻，“那么，让我来展示给你看，真嗣君！”仅犹豫了一瞬，她便拉开了顶部的结，毛巾随即掉落在她脚边的地板上，留下她赤身裸体地站在我的卧室中央，双手叉腰，脸颊上泛起一丝可爱却羞涩的红晕。

I gaped. I goggled. I stared slack-jawed and open mouthed. I very nearly exploded. I had read enough manga to be mildly surprised that a fountain of blood failed to burst forth from my nostrils. I assumed at the time that the blood had been uh… redirected elsewhere, let's say. She was so beautiful. Her still damp hair clung to her shoulders. A few rivulets of water ran down her goose pimpled flesh to her perfectly shaped breasts with the small dark circles of her nipples sticking up slightly in the cool air of the room. The hollow of her toned belly flaring out at her hips with a small, demure tuft of ginger hair her between her legs.

我目瞪口呆，瞠目结舌，嘴巴张得老大，几乎要爆炸了。我读过不少漫画，对于鼻孔没有喷出鲜血这一点，我略感惊讶。当时我猜想，那血大概是……转而流到别处去了，姑且这么说吧。她美得令人窒息。她那还带着湿气的头发紧贴在肩上，几缕水珠顺着她因寒冷而起的鸡皮疙瘩滑落到她那完美形状的胸部，小小的深色乳晕在房间的凉风中微微挺立。她那锻炼有素的腹部凹陷处向臀部展开，两腿之间有一小簇羞涩的姜黄色毛发。

I took all of this in, my eyes drank in her beauty. I had never seen, never imagined anything this transcendentally gorgeous would ever even have existed, let alone be standing here in front of me.

我全神贯注地欣赏着，我的眼睛沉醉于她的美丽。我从未见过，也从未想象过会有如此超凡脱俗的绝美存在，更不用说她就站在我面前。

Asuka, on the other hand, was blushing even more noticeably now. "Well?" She said impatiently, folding her arms under her breasts. "Are you just going to sit there with your mouth hanging open and pitching a tent in your shorts? Say something for crying out loud!"

而明日香这边，脸红得更加明显了。“怎么了？”她不耐烦地说道，双臂交叉在胸前。“你就打算坐在那儿，嘴巴张得老大，裤子里还支个帐篷吗？拜托，说点什么吧！”

"Uh… Asuka. You're beautiful!" I could feel tears welling up behind my eyes. A couple of them spilled out and down my cheek before I could even think to try and stop them.

"呃… 明日香，你真美！" 我能感觉到泪水在眼眶里打转，还没来得及想阻止，几滴已经溢出，顺着脸颊滑落。

Asuka's eyes softened and she stepped in closer to me, taking my face in her hands once more. "Why are you crying then?"

明日香的目光柔和了下来，她向我走近，再次用手捧住我的脸。“那你为什么哭呢？”

"I-I just," I sniffed. "I never expected to be this…uh… like, this happy. To ever kiss you, to see you like… I just was s-so sure that my life would be spent alone…. I can't…" I lost the power to speak as Asuka pulled my head close against her chest and held me tightly as my hot tears ran down her breasts and onto her belly.

“我……我只是，”我抽泣着说，“我从没想过会这么……呃……这么幸福。能亲吻你，看到你这样……我一直以为我的生活注定要孤独终老……我无法……”当明日香把我的头紧紧抱在她胸前，我激动得说不出话来，泪水滚烫地顺着她的胸脯流到她的腹部。

We stayed like that for some time.

我们就那样待了一会儿。

"Poor Baka-Shinji." She said gently. "You really are a sad little marshmallow beneath that invincible exterior, aren't you?"

“可怜的八嘎真嗣。”她温柔地说道，“你真的就像那坚不可摧外表下的一颗悲伤的小棉花糖，不是吗？”

"Uh-huh." I said nodding, enjoying the sensation and scent of her bare skin against my face. I didn't resist as she began to pull my t-shirt up my body and I raised my arms so to make it easier for her to pull it off me completely. She scrunched it up and used it to wipe some of the residual tears from my face before tossing it onto the floor.

"嗯哼。" 我点头说道，享受着她裸露肌肤贴在我脸上的触感和香气。当她开始将我的 T 恤往上拉时，我没有抗拒，反而举起双臂，以便她能更轻松地将它从我身上完全脱下。她将 T 恤揉成一团，用它擦去了我脸上残留的一些泪水，然后随手扔到了地板上。

She looked down at me and smiled. "Though it is nice to see that all of this outpouring of emotion hasn't affected some things!"

她低头看着我，微笑着说：“尽管看到这种情感的宣泄并没有影响到某些事情，这还是挺好的！”

I followed her gaze and noted with embarrassment that my shorts were doing nothing to hide the raging erection that had been camped inside them for the past twenty minutes.

我顺着她的目光看去，尴尬地注意到我的短裤根本无法遮掩过去二十分钟里一直藏匿其中的勃起。

"Oh, God." I said. "Thermal expansion…"

"哦，天哪。" 我说，"热胀冷缩……"

That drew a short laugh from her, before her face grew serious again. "I want to see it."

她短促地笑了一声，随后表情又严肃起来。“我想看看。”

"Wha… " "什… "

"I want to see it! You think that I'm standing her completely nude and I'm just going to let you sit there and ogle me? It's my turn now Third Child. Lose the shorts! I want to see it!"

我想看！你以为我站在这里一丝不挂，就会让你坐在那儿盯着我看吗？现在轮到我了，第三子。脱掉短裤！我要看！

Feeling incredibly self-conscious I lay back on the bed. Arching my back up I hesitated for a second before yanking my shorts down past my feet and tossing them into a far corner of the room. My erection just kinda sprang out as the shorts were pulled past them. Now it was my turn to blush.

我感到极度自我意识，于是躺回床上。我弓起背，犹豫了一秒，然后猛地拉下短裤，让它滑过脚踝，扔到房间的远角。随着短裤被拉下，我的勃起突然弹了出来。现在轮到我脸红了。

Asuka sat back down on the bed next to me. "Wow." She said. Well that was encouraging, I guess. "Can I touch it?" She was almost coy in the way she said it. I just nodded. 'This must be a dream'. Was all I could think. 'I hope that it doesn't end too soon.'

明日香又坐回到我旁边的床上，"哇。"她说道。嗯，这还挺鼓舞人心的，我想。"我可以摸摸它吗？"她问得几乎有些羞涩。我只是点了点头。'这一定是个梦'。我只能这么想。'希望它不会太快结束。'

Her hand was smaller than mine, and felt cool to the touch as it wrapped around the shaft of my penis. She just sat there, holding it in her hand with an almost puzzled expression on her face.

她的手比我的小，握住我的阴茎时感觉凉凉的。她就那样坐着，手里握着，脸上带着一种近乎困惑的表情。

"It feels warm," she whispered after a moment. "Really… really warm."

“感觉很温暖，”她过了一会儿轻声说道，“真的……真的很温暖。”

She gave it a gentle squeeze which caused it to jump a little in her hand. Slowly she began to stroke it, moving her hand along its entire length, stopping each time just below the head before sliding back down to its base. A low moan escaped me, Asuka stopped for a second, before renewing her attentions.

她轻轻地捏了一下，使得它在手中微微跳动。她开始慢慢地抚摸它，手沿着它的全长移动，每次都在头部下方稍作停留，然后滑回基部。我忍不住发出低沉的呻吟，明日香停顿了一秒，随后又继续她的动作。

I looked at her, her face was so focussed. Her eyes almost glazed as she watched her hand move up and down. Her breasts swayed slightly in time with her movements. All too quickly I could feel my muscles tighten and the pressure building up inside me. I couldn't hold on much longer.

我注视着她，她的面容如此专注。她的双眼几乎失神，目不转睛地看着自己的手上下移动。她的胸部随着动作轻轻摇摆。太快了，我能感觉到自己的肌肉紧绷，体内的压力不断积聚。我快坚持不住了。

"A-Asuka." I gasped. "I-I'm gonna… "

"飞鸟。" 我喘息着说，"我……我要……"

She seemed to understand what I was trying to convey. Her hand ceased its stroking and she crawled up the bed and kissed my urgently on the lips, her tongue teasing the inside of my mouth.

她似乎明白了我想表达的意思。她的手停止了抚摸，她爬上床，急切地吻上我的唇，她的舌头挑逗着我口腔的内部。

"My turn." She breathed sultrily in my ear. I understood and rolled off the bed as she then lay on her back. I stood looking down at her for a moment. The beautiful and mighty Asuka Langley Soryu was lying naked on my bed, looking up at me with the hunger written plain in her bright blue eyes!

“轮到我了。”她在我耳边性感地低语。我明白了，便从床上滚下来，她随即仰面躺下。我站了一会儿，低头看着她。美丽而强大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷正一丝不挂地躺在我的床上，她那明亮的蓝眼睛里写满了渴望，直勾勾地望着我！

"Hurry up, baka!" 快点，笨蛋！

Not needing to be told twice I sat down on the bed and bent over to kiss her, her lips caressed mine hungrily as I brought my hand up and gingerly cupped her right breast. A small moan was stifled by our kisses as I rubbed and stroked the nipple, which hardened and grew under my fingers. It felt so good. So firm and yet supple beneath my hand. The gasps from Asuka as I continued to massage it were sweeter than anything I had ever heard.

无需再次提醒，我便坐在床边，俯身吻她。她的唇急切地抚过我的唇，我抬起手，小心翼翼地握住她的右乳。随着我轻揉抚弄那乳头，它在我指尖下变得坚硬而膨胀，我们亲吻间压抑的轻吟声响起。那感觉如此美妙，既坚实又柔软，在我掌下。当我继续按摩时，从明日香口中传来的喘息声，比我所听过的任何声音都要甜美。

Moving my head down I took the nipple into my mouth. To hear the gasp of pleasure as I held it in my lips and tickled it with my tongue was simply heavenly. Still with her breast in my mouth I moved my hand down to between her legs, past the crinkly pubic hair and began to caress the lips of her vulva. The warmth and moisture of her lips as they opened up beneath my fingers was incredible. As were the moans of ecstasy that those caresses brought forth from her. I continued on, my fingers becoming slick and hot with the redheaded girl's growing excitement.

我低下头，将乳头含入口中。当我用唇瓣夹住它，用舌头轻触时，她那愉悦的喘息声宛如天籁。我仍含着她的乳房，手却缓缓下移至她双腿之间，越过卷曲的阴毛，开始抚摸她的阴唇。随着我的手指探入，她唇间的温热与湿润令人难以置信。同样令人动容的，还有她因这些爱抚而发出的陶醉呻吟。我继续着，手指因这位红发女孩愈发高涨的激情而变得滑腻滚烫。

I kept going, alternately teasing her nipples with my lips and tongue and kissing her sweet mouth. All the while my right hand continued its massaging and probing of her most private area.

我继续前行，时而用唇舌轻挑她的乳尖，时而亲吻她甜美的双唇。与此同时，我的右手持续在她最私密的地方按摩和探索。

I was struck suddenly by the memory of a drunken Misato, way back before Asuka even came to Japan, putting her arm around my shoulders and slurring "You wanna keep a girl forever, you gotta kiss her, you know, down there…" Followed by some rather embarrassing gesticulations towards the critical area. I remember being mortified with embarrassment, and Misato laughing drunkenly at my blush, but it put me in mind to see if it actually worked.

我突然想起很久以前，在明日香还没来日本时，喝醉的 Misato 搂着我的肩膀，口齿不清地说：“你想永远留住一个女孩，就得亲她，知道吗，那里……”接着还尴尬地指向了关键部位。我记得当时羞得无地自容，而 Misato 则醉醺醺地笑看我脸红，但这让我好奇这种方法是否真的有效。

Asuka was still breathing heavily, small moans of pleasure escaping her as my fingers continued their work.

明日香仍在沉重地呼吸，随着我的手指继续动作，她不时发出愉悦的轻哼。

I moved back up from her breast and kissed her again. My hand still not ceasing to caress her. "I wanna try something." I said.

我再次从她的胸前移开，吻了她一下，手依旧不停地抚摸着她。“我想尝试点什么。”我说道。

"Uh-huh…" "嗯哼…"

I moved back down until I was kneeling between her spread legs, scooting just a little further back I lay on my stomach at the end of the bed and brought my face down between her legs. I took in the sheer delicate beauty of her, the musky scent of it and the small, neatly trimmed, patch of light ginger hair just above it. A small note of sheer disbelief at where I was and what I was about to do sounded in the back of my mind. I dismissed it. Nothing could distract me from the Redheaded Goddess before me. Hesitating for just a second I finally leaned forward and kissed her glistening sex and quickly used my tongue to explore it fully. Asuka gasped and clutched her hands into my hair, forcing me firmly into contact with her as I lapped and probed her with my tongue.

我缓缓下移，直至跪在她张开的双腿之间，稍稍后退，趴在床尾，脸庞贴近她双腿之间。我沉醉于她那纯粹而精致的美，那股麝香般的气息，以及上方那片整齐修剪、淡雅姜黄色的毛发。心底隐约响起一丝难以置信的惊叹，质疑我此刻的所在与即将的举动。我将其抛诸脑后。眼前这位红发女神，任何事物都无法使我分心。犹豫片刻后，我终于倾身向前，轻吻她湿润的私处，随即用舌头深入探索。明日香倒吸一口气，双手紧抓我的头发，将我牢牢按向她，任由我以舌尖舔舐、探寻。

I reached it as far as I could inside her. The taste here was very strong, and I found it a bit over powering, so I brought my fingers back and pushing them gently inside her I continued my licking and exploring of her inner lips.

我尽可能深入地触达她的内部。这里的味道非常浓烈，我觉得有些过于强烈，于是我将手指抽回，轻柔地再次探入她的体内，继续舔舐和探索她的内唇。

My ears soon told me which were the best places to stimulate, a small nub just above her opening seemed especially sensitive to my tongue. I concentrated on this and the folds around it as my fingers kept stroking her inside. Asuka seemed to really be losing herself in it. It was possibly the single sexiest thing I have ever experienced. She was now gasping and crying out as I went down on her. Her hands roughly grasping my hair and pulling me in as her hips bucked and ground in time with my strokes.

我的耳朵很快告诉我哪些地方最值得刺激，她开口上方的一个小突起对我的舌头尤为敏感。我专注于这一点及其周围的褶皱，同时手指继续在她体内轻抚。明日香似乎真的沉浸其中，这或许是我经历过的最性感的一幕。她现在正喘息着、呼喊着，当我俯身亲吻她时，她的双手粗暴地抓住我的头发，将我拉近，而她的臀部则随着我的抚摸节奏起伏磨蹭。

In fact she was getting so loud that I was seriously glad that we had no neighbours on this floor, I'm sure they would have called the police on us, and that would have been way beyond embarrassing.

事实上，她声音越来越大，我真庆幸我们这层楼没有邻居，否则他们肯定会报警，那可就尴尬至极了。

After what felt like only a short amount of time Asuka's breathing and moans became hoarser and her hips seemed to be losing their rhythm. Her hands grasped at my hair, grinding my face into her as I kissed and sucked her into my mouth. Finally she seemed to reach the peak as I could feel her whole body tense and her vagina tightening strongly and convulsively against my fingers.

仿佛只过了短暂片刻，明日香的呼吸和呻吟变得愈发沙哑，她的腰肢似乎也失去了节奏。她的双手紧抓我的头发，将我的脸紧紧压向她，而我则亲吻并吮吸着她，将她纳入口中。最终，她似乎达到了顶峰，我能感受到她全身紧绷，阴道强烈而痉挛地紧缩着我的手指。

"Ssssssshinji…. Oh…. Gott…" She gasped as I slowed down my ministrations to a more gentle pace. Her breathing slowly returned to a steady rhythm and her hands untangled themselves from my hair. I stopped my kissing and looked up at her flushed and sweating face smiling down the length of her naked body at me from between her breasts. I grinned back at her. My mouth and chin wet from her orgasm and juices.

"新治……哦……天啊……" 随着我放缓动作，转为更温柔的抚慰，她喘息着。她的呼吸逐渐恢复平稳，双手也从我的发间松开。我停止了亲吻，抬头望向她那因激情而泛红、汗涔涔的脸庞，从她双乳间对我微笑。我也回以微笑，嘴角和下巴沾满了她的高潮与爱液。

"Gott Shinji," She said breathlessly, "Where on Earth did you learn to do that?"

"真嗣，" 她气喘吁吁地说，"你到底是在哪儿学会那招的？"

"I dunno." I replied. "I just kind of winged it and listened to how you responded. How was it?"

“我也不太清楚。”我回答道，“我就是随机应变，根据你的反应来调整的。效果怎么样？”

She sighed. "Th-that was amazing!"

她叹了口气。“那真是太神奇了！”

My grin widened. "I'm glad you enjoyed it, Asuka."

我的笑容更灿烂了。“很高兴你喜欢，明日香。”

She closed her eyes and took several deep breaths. I looked on transfixed as her breasts rose and fell with each breath. She opened her eyes again, the sapphire blue had never seemed so bright and vivid to me as it did right then.

她闭上眼睛，深吸了几口气。我目不转睛地看着她的胸部随着每一次呼吸起伏。她再次睁开眼睛，那蓝宝石般的眸子从未像此刻这样，在我眼中显得如此明亮和生动。

"Oh, I'm not finished with you yet, Shinji-kun!"

"哦，我还没和你完事呢，真嗣君！"

I looked at her in mock alarm.

我带着夸张的惊慌看着她。

"Come up here and kiss me, Baka!"

“上来亲我一下，笨蛋！”

I got up on my hands and knees and crawled up the bed so that we were face to face. Leaning down I kissed her with all of the repressed and unfulfilled passion I had in my being. She returned in kind, our tongues both playfully exploring each other's mouths.

我双手双膝撑起身体，爬上床，与她面对面。我俯下身，将内心压抑未了的激情全部倾注于这一吻。她同样热烈地回应，我们的舌头在彼此口中嬉戏探索。

I was also very aware that the tip of my erect penis was now positioned up against the opening of her pussy. I could see by her eyes that she was just as aware of it as I was.

我也非常清楚，我勃起的阴茎尖端此刻正紧贴着她的阴道口。从她的眼神中我能看出，她对此同样心知肚明。

"I want you to… take me, Shinji. Do it, please!"

我想让你……带我走，真嗣。请这么做吧！

"A-Are you sure Asuka?"

"啊，你确定是明日香吗？"

"Y-Yes. But, be gentle! They say it can hurt the first time!"

"是的，但是要温柔点！听说第一次会疼的！"

I nodded, there was no way I was going to hurt her if I could possibly avoid it.

我点了点头，如果有可能避免的话，我绝不会伤害她。

"Are you ready?" I said.

"你准备好了吗？" 我说。

She nodded, smiling as she saw the worry in my eyes.

她点头微笑，因为我眼中的担忧而感到欣慰。

"Okay…" "好的…"

I gently pushed forward into the warmth of her body. I kept my eyes on Asuka's face as my hips thrust forward. Initially there was a lot of resistance against my erection as it slowly pushed deeper into her. Asuka hissed slightly through her teeth. "S-Stop for a second…" She said. "That's it, okay. A bit more, s-slowly."

我轻柔地向前推进，融入她身体的温暖之中。我的目光始终停留在明日香的脸庞上，随着腰部的推进。起初，我的勃起遇到了相当大的阻力，缓缓深入时，明日香轻吸一口气，牙齿间发出微弱的嘶声。“等一下…”她说道，“好了，就这样。再稍微，慢一点。”

With as much patience as I could muster, and never looking away from her beautiful face, she guided me into her until my full length was engulfed in the velvet heat of her.

我竭尽所能地保持耐心，目光始终不离开她美丽的脸庞，她引导我进入她的世界，直到我的全部被她那如丝绒般温暖的热度所包围。

She opened her eyes. We stared at each other. Both sharing the same thought of the significance of what we were doing, and how nothing would ever be the same for either of us. Her arms wrapped around me and pulled me down into a fierce open mouthed kiss.

她睁开了眼睛。我们凝视着彼此。两人都深知我们正在做的事情的重要性，以及这对我们任何一方来说，一切都将不再相同。她的双臂环抱着我，将我拉下，我们激烈地张嘴亲吻。

"Okay," She said. "I'm ready. Let's do this!"

"好的，"她说，"我准备好了。我们开始吧！"

Slowly, gently at first, I began moving myself inside her. She moved her hips in time with me so that I could delve deeper into her with every thrust. Her vagina was so hot and wet that her initial tightness gave way to the most amazing feeling of being completely at one with her in that most intimate and beautiful of moments.

起初缓慢而温柔，我开始在她体内移动。她随着我的节奏摆动臀部，让我每一次挺进都能更深入地探入她。她的阴道如此炽热湿润，起初的紧致感逐渐转变为一种与她完全合一的绝妙体验，在那最亲密而美好的时刻。

Her hands ran up and down my back and along bare hips and buttocks as they clenched and relaxed with each forward motion. She wasn't moaning any more, but her breathing was heavy and ragged, as was mine with the exertion involved. Asuka's arms then wrapped around my back as she pulled me down into another passionate kiss. Our bodies were now pressed against each other and I could feel her erect nipples rubbing against my chest as I moved on top of her.

她的双手在我的背上、裸露的臀部和股间来回游走，随着每一次前行的动作紧握又放松。她不再呻吟，但呼吸沉重而急促，正如我因用力而呼吸急促一样。随后，明日香的胳膊环抱住我的背，将我拉下，再次投入一个充满激情的吻中。此刻，我们的身体紧紧相贴，我能感觉到她挺立的乳尖随着我在她身上的动作摩擦着我的胸膛。

Slowly, but inexorably, I could feel the sensitivity and tension build up in my erection as it moved within her, I tried to make it last just a little longer, but after a few more minutes I finally came. I gripped Asuka tightly to me as I felt the climax take me and held her as the spasms of my orgasm drenched the inside of her vagina with my semen.

渐渐地，尽管缓慢却不可阻挡，我能感觉到自己的勃起在她体内移动时，敏感度和紧张感不断累积。我试图让它持续得更久一些，但几分钟后，我终于达到了高潮。我紧紧抱住明日香，感受着高潮的来临，并在我的射精痉挛中，让精液充满了她的阴道。

"Nnnnnggggggh!" I managed to say at that moment. Or something similarly articulate.

"嗯嗯嗯嗯嗯！" 那一刻我勉强挤出这么一声，或者类似表达清晰的话语。

We lay there for I don't know how long afterwards. Just holding each other like castaways in a storm. The cicadas droned on relentlessly outside as we held on to one another, heedless to the World or anything except the closeness between us. Eventually, I propped myself up on my elbows and kissed Asuka tenderly on the lips. She blessed me with a smile of unimaginable sweetness.

之后我们躺在那里，不知过了多久。就像暴风雨中的遇难者一样，紧紧相拥。外面的蝉鸣无休无止，我们彼此依偎，对世界或任何事物都置若罔闻，只感受到彼此间的亲密。最终，我用手肘撑起身体，温柔地吻了明日香的唇。她以一个难以想象的甜美微笑回应我，仿佛赐予了我祝福。

"I love you, Asuka." I said and I kissed her again.

"我爱你，明日香。" 我说着，再次吻了她。

"You better, Shinji-kun. 'Cos after this you're never gonna be able to get rid of me! You got that?" She said, still smiling that heartbreakingly gorgeous smile.

你最好做好准备，真嗣君。因为这次之后，你永远也别想摆脱我了！明白了吗？" 她依旧带着那令人心碎的绝美微笑说道。

I nodded solemnly. "As you wish." I said seriously.

我郑重地点了点头，“如你所愿。”我严肃地说道。

"You are so corny sometimes!"

你有时候真是太老土了！

"Thank you, I think."

谢谢，我想。

"Baka…" She said. Though now it was with an expression of pure tenderness. She raised her hand and lightly brushed my cheek.

"笨蛋…" 她轻声说道，此刻脸上却洋溢着纯粹的温柔。她抬起手，轻轻抚过我的脸颊。

"Shinji-kun?" "真嗣君？"

"Yes?" "是的？"

"I hate to break the mood, but it's been a big day!"

我真不想打破这气氛，但今天可真是充实的一天啊！

I couldn't disagree with her there.

在那一点上，我无法不同意她。

"And… um… well…" She continued. "I'm, uh… kinda starving, especially after all of our uh… after we ummmm… you know…."

“然后…呃…这个…”她接着说，“我，呃…有点饿坏了，特别是在我们经历了那些…在我们呃…嗯…你知道的…之后。”

"Yes?" I knew what she wanted to ask, but I was enjoying myself too much to stop.

"怎么了？" 我知道她想问什么，但我正玩得开心，不想停下来。

"Um, Shinji?" "呃，真嗣？"

"Yes, my darling Asuka?"

"是的，我亲爱的明日香？"

She narrowed her eyes at me, which I found very sexy, especially considering where we were, you know, naked in my bed with me still on top of her, I was still inside her after all.

她眯起眼睛看着我，我觉得这非常性感，尤其考虑到我们所在的环境——赤裸地躺在我的床上，我依然压在她身上，毕竟我还留在她体内。

"Baka!" She said getting annoyed. "I'm hungry! Make me some dinner!... Please?"

"笨蛋！" 她有些恼火地说，"我饿了！给我做点晚饭吧！... 拜托了？"

I planted a huge kiss right on her lips.

我直接在她唇上深深地吻了一下。

"Of course Asuka! Why didn't you ask earlier?"

当然可以，明日香！你怎么不早点问呢？

"Meh." 翻译文本："一般般。"

End of Chapter 5 第五章结束

A/N: Egad! That was tough to write! I'm interested in what you thought of it. If the general consensus is that the lemon scene sucked, then I will happily do a re-write to tone it down/remove/rewrite it, I feel that it was important to show Asuka and Shinji attaining that level of intimacy as a very important part of their relationship and emotional growth. However, I may be crap at writing Lemon scenes, I don't know, this is my first ever attempt! So let me know what you think, and hopefully no-one is too offended!

作者注：哎呀！写这个真费劲！我很想知道你们的看法。如果大家普遍觉得那段柠檬情节很糟糕，那我会乐意进行修改、删减或重写。我认为展示明日香和真嗣达到那种亲密程度是他们关系和情感成长中非常重要的一部分。不过，我可能不擅长写这类场景，我也不确定，这毕竟是我第一次尝试！所以请告诉我你们的想法，希望不会有人太介意！

Also... if this is considered too explicit for then let me know I'll have a go at toning it down. I'm new at this so let me know!

另外……如果这被认为过于直白，请告诉我，我会尝试调整措辞。我是新手，请多指教！

Toodles... Donderkind. 再见... 唐德金德。

## Chapter 6 Getting Away With It (All Messed Up)逍遥法外（一团糟）

A/N: {So… still reading on after the Lemon Scene? Do you still respect me after we've, you know, crossed that threshold? Maybe we can discuss our feelings about it over a light brunch and a coffee? I know a nice place… Am I being too needy? I hope that things won't get too awkward between us now.

作者的话：{那么……在经历了那段“柠檬场景”后，你还继续阅读吗？在我们跨越了那道界限之后，你对我还有尊重吗？或许我们可以边享用清淡的早午餐边喝咖啡，聊聊对此的感受？我知道一个不错的地方……我是不是太粘人了？希望我们之间不会因此变得太尴尬。

Alright, I'll shut up! ^_-

好吧，我闭嘴！^_-

So here's Chapter 6, hope you're enjoying it thus far. }

这里是第六章，希望你到目前为止都读得津津有味。}

BTW: Evangelion is in no way mine. If the owners of Eva somehow find this and object to it, I'll take it down, and then hide in my room and sulk for about a month or so.

顺便说一句：《新世纪福音战士》绝非我的。如果 Eva 的版权方偶然发现这个并提出异议，我会将其撤下，然后躲在房间里闷闷不乐大约一个月。

Anyways, here goes! 不管怎样，开始吧！

Life is weird. 生活真奇怪。

If someone had told me that morning when I had gotten out of bed that by that night Shinji Ikari and I would have been, you know… intimate… I probably would have laughed in their faces long enough to distract them so I could kick them in the shins, knock them to the ground and break their fingers.

如果那天早上我起床时有人告诉我，到了晚上我会和碇真嗣，你知道的……亲密无间……我可能会笑得足够久来分散他们的注意力，然后踢他们的胫骨，把他们打倒在地，再折断他们的手指。

I tended towards the extreme end of reactions in those days. Especially where Shinji was concerned. You know the old saying: 'You always hurt the ones you love' and others like it. I think it was Shakespeare, or perhaps someone else, who said something like 'Methinks the lady doth protesteth too mucheth'

那时的我往往反应过激，尤其是涉及到真嗣的时候。你知道那句老话：“你总是伤害你爱的人”，还有类似的说法。我想是莎士比亚，或者可能是其他人，说过类似“我以为这位女士抗议得太过分了”的话。

Or something like that, perhaps with a few fewer 'eths'. I don't know. I don't care.

或者类似那样的话，可能少几个“eth”。我不知道，我也不在乎。

Anyways, that was me back then. It took a truly seismic crumbling of my 'Ace' façade to make me wake up and smell what the Third Child actually meant to me. It's funny how what I realise now were the years of PTSD and loveless homes that had been my life until I came to Tokyo-3 had created an obnoxious and incredibly brittle shell. A shell that had begun to crack almost as soon as one Ikari. S had landed in my life.

无论如何，那时的我就是那样。直到我那坚不可摧的“王牌”外壳真正崩塌，我才恍然大悟，明白了第三子对我意味着什么。有趣的是，我如今才意识到，那些年我经历的创伤后应激障碍和缺乏爱的家庭生活，直到我来到第三新东京市之前，塑造了一个既傲慢又极其脆弱的外壳。这个外壳几乎在我遇到碇真嗣的那一刻就开始破裂了。

It was almost irreparably cracked on the day we went out to the crater, especially when I saw him so still and lifeless seeming with me under the rubble. The relief I felt when he finally woke that day was not even lessened by the fact that he nearly gave me a God-damned concussion!

在我们去那个陨石坑的那天，它几乎彻底破碎了，尤其是当我看到他躺在废墟下，一动不动，仿佛失去了生命。当他最终醒来时，我感到的宽慰并没有因为差点给我造成脑震荡而减少！

My anger at him when he took the blame for me in front of Misato and the Commander was I guess just the last stand of my Soryu pride. I hated being treated like a little girl that needed protecting. I knew, even then, the reason he did it was because he cared about me and was trying to shield me from his Father's anger. I knew what it cost him to put himself in emotional harms ways like that.

当他在美里和指挥官面前为我承担责任时，我对他的愤怒，我想，只是我索里优骄傲的最后抵抗。我讨厌被当作需要保护的小女孩。即使那时我也知道，他这么做是因为他关心我，试图保护我免受他父亲的怒火。我知道他那样做要付出多大的情感代价。

But I almost hated him for making me feel like a helpless little girl. It made me feel guilty, and guilt is one of the most insidious and debilitating of emotions. Damn him for making me feel that way!

但我几乎恨他让我感觉自己像个无助的小女孩。这让我感到内疚，而内疚是最阴险和令人衰弱的情绪之一。真该死，他竟让我有那种感觉！

I suppose I should be grateful to Hikari, and even that bonehead Suzuhara, for putting it into perspective in a way. I realised why I was so pissed off was because I was angry at myself. Angry that I had let Shinji take the blame for my wrongs. Angry because the one person who treated me decently for who I was, who made me feel like maybe I was worthwhile, and not just because I piloted the Evangelion, was suffering for my actions.

我想我应该感谢光，甚至是那个笨蛋铃原，他们以某种方式让我看清了现实。我意识到自己为何如此愤怒，是因为我在生自己的气。气自己让真嗣替我背了黑锅。气因为那个唯一以本真待我、让我觉得或许自己也有价值、不仅仅因为我是驾驶福音战士的人，却因我的行为而受苦。

Hikari hadn't just cracked my shell, she had taken to it with an axe. With that Ape Toji giving it a few fatal blows as well. After I had trudged home in the rain, and stood in the bathroom staring at the stranger in the mirror it was like that shell had been sloughed off, quite painfully mind you, and left me naked, physically, of course, but mentally and emotionally as well.

光不仅打破了我的外壳，她还用斧头狠狠地劈开了它。再加上那个猿猴般的户城，又给了几下致命的打击。当我冒雨艰难地回到家，站在浴室里凝视着镜中那个陌生人时，仿佛那层外壳已被痛苦地剥离，让我赤裸裸地暴露出来，当然，不仅是身体上的，更是心灵和情感上的。

Anyways, I think that I'm truly labouring my mixed metaphors here.

不管怎样，我觉得我在这里真的是在混用比喻。

I realised that there was no point being the best and greatest Pilot in the World if that World doesn't give a rat's ass if you lived or died because you were an obnoxious brat. That realisation was truly the most devastating one for me ever to have to face.

我意识到，如果那个世界根本不在乎你的生死，只因为你是个讨厌的小鬼，那么成为世界上最优秀、最伟大的飞行员也毫无意义。这个认识对我来说，是前所未有的沉重打击。

Don't judge me for finding comfort in Shinji's arms, his kisses, his bed. My life up to that point was truly one messed up pile of shit. Don't dare judge me for finding solace, comfort and perhaps, for the first time in my young life, the chance of being happy and looking outside of myself with the one person who had always treated me like I mattered for more than just an empty list of achievements!

不要因为我从真嗣的怀抱、他的吻、他的床上寻求慰藉而评判我。在那之前，我的生活真是一团糟透了的烂摊子。不要妄自评判我寻求慰藉、安慰，或许，在我年轻的生命中，这是第一次有机会感受到幸福，并和那个始终视我为重要、不止是一串空洞成就的人一起，向外看世界！

In all truth, Shinji was, and still is I guess, the only person in the entire World whose life and experiences come even close to my own. We may have handled it in different ways, but we were like two sides of the same coin. He was the Yin to my Yang, or something like that.

说实话，真嗣曾经是，现在我想也依然是，全世界中唯一一个生活和经历与我如此相似的人。我们或许处理方式不同，但我们就像同一枚硬币的两面。他是我的阴，我是他的阳，或者类似这样的关系。

Not that he wasn't still a whiny little baka. It's just now he was MY whiny little baka! And as he and I lay, naked in each other's arms that night, I think that it was the first time I knew that happiness could exist. And maybe, just maybe, if I didn't try to sabotage it like I was wont to do; I might just be allowed to have a taste of it.

并非说他不再是那个爱抱怨的小傻瓜。只是现在，他是属于我的爱抱怨的小傻瓜！那晚，我们赤裸相拥而眠，我想那是我第一次意识到幸福的存在。或许，只要我不像往常那样试图破坏它，我或许就能尝到幸福的滋味。

After Shinji had made a simple dinner of fried rice with chicken from what he had gathered from the kitchen we had returned again to his bedroom. My own larger room no longer held any appeal for me. We made love again, more gently, less urgently than our first time. There was no need to rush now. There was a comfort, a safety I felt in his arms that belied his generally more nervous temperament. I took the time to really enjoy the both the physicality and the deep connection with him that I felt in that act. The absolute intensity as I felt him move inside me was just indescribable. Then, just as I was pushed beyond the point of no return and was overwhelmed by the virtual tsunami of my own orgasm, I felt him come inside me for the second time that day. It was all truly beyond my most fevered teenaged imaginings. Maybe I was the perverted one?

在真嗣用厨房里搜集到的食材简单做了鸡肉炒饭作为晚餐后，我们再次回到了他的卧室。我自己那间更大的房间对我已不再有吸引力。我们再次亲热，这次更温柔，没有初次那么急切。现在无需匆忙。在他怀中，我感受到一种舒适与安全，这与他通常较为紧张的性格相悖。我花时间真正享受了身体上的接触以及在那行为中感受到的与他深层的联系。当他动起来时，那种绝对强烈的感受难以言表。就在我被推过无法回头的临界点，被自己如虚拟海啸般的性高潮淹没之际，我感觉到他那天第二次在我体内释放。这一切真的超出了我最狂热的青春期幻想。或许，我才是那个变态的人？

Think what you like. Call me a slut, call me whatever you want. I still don't care.

随你怎么想。叫我荡妇也好，随便你叫什么。我还是不在乎。

Afterwards we just lay there. I was on my side with Shinji nestled behind me under the covers. Our nude bodies sharing the warmth of the afterglow. His arm draped over my bare side and our fingers interlocked in front of me as we drank in the silence and the blissful closeness we shared.

之后我们就那样躺着。我侧身躺着，真嗣在我身后蜷缩在被子里。我们裸露的身体分享着余韵的温暖。他的手臂搭在我裸露的腰侧，我们的手指在我面前交缠，我们沉浸在宁静和共享的幸福亲密中。

I'm not sure when I drifted into the world of sleep, but no dreams or nightmares marred my slumber that night.

我不确定自己何时悄然进入了梦乡，但那一夜，既无梦境也无噩梦打扰我的安眠。

"Tadaima!" 我回来了！

My eyes flew open. 'What the…?'

我的眼睛猛地睁开。“什么鬼……？”

Shinji's bedroom was bathed in the early morning light streaming in through the window. We were still lying in the 'spoons' position and very much still naked underneath the light cotton sheet. Shinji wasn't yet awake, although it seems a certain part of him was very much up and ready to party on without him! I probably would have been happy to oblige, but for one thing…. And that thing was: 'Tadaima!'

清晨的阳光透过窗户洒满了真嗣的卧室。我们仍保持着“勺子”般的拥抱姿势，轻薄的棉被下，两人依旧赤裸。真嗣还未醒来，但似乎他身体某部分已精神抖擞，准备独自狂欢！我本可能乐意奉陪，但有一件事……那便是：“我回来了！”

Ohhhhhhh….. Fuck…. Misato!

哦……天啊…… 碇司令！

"Shinji... Shinji!" I whispered frantically at my somnolent bedmate.

"真嗣...真嗣！" 我焦急地对着我那昏昏欲睡的床伴低声呼唤。

"Wh-wha…?" Shinji muttered groggily. His eyes widened momentarily when he saw me in his bed, before a coy grin spread across his features. Any other time I would have found it endearing. However, something far more alarming was happening that the poor fool was completely unaware of.

"什、什么…？" 真嗣含糊地嘟囔着。当他看到我躺在他的床上时，眼睛瞬间睁大，随后脸上露出了狡黠的笑容。换作平时，我或许会觉得这很可爱。然而，此刻正发生着一件远比这更令人震惊的事情，而这个可怜的家伙却浑然不觉。

"Misato's home!" I whispered, filling him in on our current emergency.

"美里家到了！" 我低声说道，向他通报了我们当前的紧急情况。

A second's pause. "Mi-Misato?"

一秒钟的停顿。“Misato？”

I nodded, taking a second to give him a quick kiss on the lips before I sprang out of his bed and looked around me for somewhere to hide. Damn Shinji's tiny room with its lack of closets to hide in! I could hear Misato's footsteps coming down the hallway towards the apartment's bedrooms.

我点了点头，趁机在他唇上迅速一吻，随即从他床上跳下，环顾四周寻找藏身之处。该死的真嗣，房间这么小，连个能藏身的衣柜都没有！我能听见美里正沿着走廊朝卧室这边走来。

Shinji also leapt from his bed, still at half-mast might I add, ecchi, and also looked around him in panic.

真嗣也从床上跳了起来，顺便说一句，还是半睡半醒的状态，真是色情，同时他也惊慌地环顾四周。

"Well?" I whispered urgently. " Do something!" I could just picture the fallout if Misato suddenly opened the door to find Shinji and I arguing naked about where the best hiding spots in his room were!

"怎么样？"我急切地低声说道，"快做点什么！"我简直能想象到，如果美里突然开门发现真嗣和我正光着身子争论他房间里最佳藏身地点的后果！

"U-Under the desk!" He whispered back, pointing to the foot-well of his small student's desk in the corner of the room.

"躲到桌子下面去！"他低声回应，指向房间角落里他那张小学生的书桌下的脚踏空间。

I shot him a look that would have curdled fresh milk as I curled myself into a ball, wedging into the tiny area under his desk. He quickly placed his chair in front of the desk and hung my red towel over it to conceal me slightly more effectively.

我向他投去一个足以让鲜奶凝固的眼神，同时蜷缩成一团，挤进他桌子下那狭小的空间。他迅速将椅子移到桌前，并把我的红毛巾挂在上面，以便更有效地遮掩我。

This sucked, big time. I could only hope that Misato would just collapse straight into bed after pulling another all-nighter back at NERV. Shinji scuttled back into his bed and pulled the covers well over his body. Just in time too, might I add.

这太糟糕了，严重得很。我只能希望美里在 NERV 又熬了一个通宵后，会直接瘫倒在床上。真嗣赶紧溜回自己的床，把被子严严实实地拉过身体。我得说，时机也刚刚好。

There was a gentle knock at the door. "Shinji?" Misato called from the other side. Dammit!

门外传来轻轻的敲门声。“真嗣？”明日香在另一边喊道。该死！

"Yeah?" He answered. "是吗？" 他回答道。

"Can I come in?" 我能进来吗？

"I-I'm trying to sleep Misato…"

“我……我正试着睡觉， 美里……”

The door slid open. I could just see a small crack of light from the hall and Misato's bare feet from my lowly vantage point.

门缓缓打开，从我低矮的视角仅能瞥见门厅的一线光亮和美里赤裸的双脚。

"Shinji… " Misato said again, more gently. "Can I talk to you for a moment?"

"真嗣…" 美里再次开口，语气更加温柔，"我能和你聊一会儿吗？"

There was a lengthy pause. "Yeah."

经过一段长时间的停顿后，"是的。"

Gott… I was really uncomfortable. Whatever it she wanted, I hoped she would be quick about it!

天哪……我真的感觉很不舒服。无论她想要什么，我希望她能快点搞定！

"I wanted to tell you, tell you that you did a very noble thing the other day."

我想告诉你，告诉你那天你做了一件非常高尚的事。

"What do you mean?"

"For Asuka… For me. Taking the blame for the snafu during the battle. I know what it means for you to face your Father like that. It was… very brave."

为了明日香……也为了我自己。承担战斗中混乱的责任。我明白你那样面对父亲意味着什么。那真是……非常勇敢。

"No, Misato." He replied. "I-I'm not brave… I just couldn't bear to see either of you suffer for me. Not when I could d-do something about it."

“不，美里。”他回答道，“我……我并不勇敢……我只是无法忍受看到你们任何一个人为我受苦。尤其是在我还能做些什么的时候。”

"No, that is brave! A-and I want you to know how much I know it cost you. I appreciate it. And I-I know Asuka does too."

不，那很勇敢！我想让你知道我有多明白这对你意味着什么。我很感激。而且我知道明日香也是。

"Misato… " Shinji said softly. I tensed in my hiding spot. Don't say anything stupid!

"Misato…" 真嗣轻声说道。我在藏身处紧张起来。别说蠢话！

"No, Shinji, let me finish. I know that right now, Asuka seems mad with you. You might even think she hates you?" She paused as if to give him a chance to answer, but he said nothing. Smart boy. Despite my position, despite being stark naked and scrunched into a tiny space beneath an Ikea Clearance Centre student's desk, I leaned my head slightly forward as if to hear better.

不，真嗣，让我说完。我知道现在，明日香似乎对你很生气。你甚至可能认为她讨厌你？她停顿了一下，好像给他一个回答的机会，但他什么也没说。聪明的孩子。尽管我的处境尴尬，尽管我赤身裸体蜷缩在宜家清仓中心的学生桌子下狭小的空间里，我还是微微前倾了下头，仿佛为了听得更清楚。

Misato continued. "She's a complicated girl… She doesn't like to feel beholden to anyone."

碇真嗣继续说道：“她是个复杂的女孩……她不喜欢感觉自己欠了任何人。”

Still he didn't answer her.

他仍然没有回答她。

"She likes to talk big," My ears were just about out on stalks now. "But it's just because she's had a… a tough life, she needs to prove herself. She doesn't mean all of the hurtful things she says."

"她喜欢说大话，" 我的耳朵现在几乎都竖起来了。"但这只是因为她有过一段……艰难的生活，她需要证明自己。她并不是有意说出那些伤人的话。"

I had a good mind to come leaping out from where I was hiding and give her a piece of my mind for discussing me like I wasn't even there. Even though, as far as she knew, I wasn't. That would have showed her! But even I didn't feel I could make a strong argument while standing nude in my housemate's bedroom. I stayed hidden and seethed silently.

我真想从藏身之处一跃而出，就她当我不在场似的议论我这件事，好好给她上一课。尽管在她看来，我确实不在场。那一定会让她大吃一惊！但我自己也觉得，光着身子站在室友的卧室里，实在难以有力地反驳。我只好继续躲藏，默默地生着闷气。

"I know that Misato."

我知道，是美里。

"She, cares about you very much, Shinji." I heard him give a short laugh. Misato misinterpreted it. "It's true! It might not seem like it right now, but she knows what it cost you to do what you did. It's just difficult for her to show it. It's like she equates kindness with weakness."

"她非常关心你，真嗣。" 我听到他短促地笑了笑。美里误解了。"这是真的！虽然现在看起来可能不是这样，但她知道你为了做那些事付出了什么代价。只是她难以表达出来。就好像她把温柔等同于软弱。"

Bah! 呸！

"But she's really a good person. I know with time she'll let you see that side of her. When she does, I think the two if you will become good friends."

但她真的是个好人。我相信随着时间的推移，她会让你看到她的那一面。当她这么做时，我想你们俩会成为好朋友。

"I hope so, Misato." He replied. I smiled to myself in my hiding place.

"希望如此，美里。" 他回答道。我在藏身之处暗自微笑。

"Me too, Shinji-kun. Nothing would make me happier! Now, get some more sleep! Just because you don't have to go to school doesn't mean you can sleep in all day though!"

我也是，真嗣君。没有什么比这更让我高兴的了！现在，再去睡会儿吧！虽然你不用上学，但也不能整天睡懒觉哦！

"Yes, Misato." 是的，美里。

I could see her feet move as she turned to leave.

我能看见她转身离开时脚的移动。

"Misato…" He called after her. Her feet stopped.

"Misato…" 他叫住了她。她的脚步停了下来。

"Yes?" "什么事？"

"Thank you." 谢谢。

"You're very welcome, Shinji-kun! Now get some sleep! I'm gonna hit the shower and then get some much needed sleep myself. And one more thing…" She said. I could now see that her feet walking over towards the desk where I was hiding.

"Yes?" He said nervously. My heart leapt into my throat. Had she discovered me?

"怎么了？" 他紧张地说。我的心一下子提到了嗓子眼。难道她发现我了？

"Don't let Asuka find out you've been using one of her favourite Red Towels! She might be a kind girl underneath it all, but she'd wring your neck if she found out that you had one of them in your room!"

别让明日香发现你一直在用她最喜欢的红色毛巾之一！她骨子里可能是个善良的女孩，但要是她发现你房间里有那条毛巾，她会扭断你的脖子！

"Y-Yes Misato." My relief was reflected in his voice. Thankfully her feet once again moved away from my vantage point.

"是，是，Misato。" 我的安心感在他的声音中得到了体现。幸好，她的脚再次从我的观察点移开了。

Finally the door closed. I stayed put until I heard the bathroom door shut and the shower begin to flow.

最终，门关上了。我静候着，直到听见浴室门关闭，淋浴开始流淌。

I pushed the chair out of the way and clambered out from under the desk, looking down at Shinji with a raised eyebrow.

我把椅子推到一边，从桌子底下爬出来，扬起眉毛低头看着真嗣。

"Thanks for defending me, baka!" I said, grabbing the towel off the chair and wrapping it around my body.

"谢谢你帮我辩护，笨蛋！" 我说着，从椅子上抓起毛巾，裹在身上。

He turned several shades of red and stuttered his response. "B-But I-If I'd tried to defend you s-she would have been suspicious! I-I thought the less I said the b-better!"

他的脸涨得通红，结结巴巴地回应道：“但、但是，如果我试图为你辩护，她、她肯定会起疑心的！我、我觉得我说的越少越好！”

He had a point, but I was still a bit annoyed at being portrayed as some kind of ogre, I was a good person! But I was also enjoying seeing him squirm just a little too much to stop right then. I stepped up to him until our faces were almost touching. "You know what, Shinji?" I said, narrowing my eyes.

他说的有道理，但我还是有点恼火，被描绘成某种怪物，我可是个好人！不过，看到他那副窘迫的样子，我也有点乐在其中，一时半会儿还不想停下来。我走到他面前，直到我们的脸几乎贴在一起。“你知道吗，真嗣？”我眯起眼睛说道。

"What?" He answered nervously.

"什么？" 他紧张地回答。

I leaned forward just a little and planted a big wet kiss on his lips. "Fooled ya! You did okay there Shinji-kun! She doesn't suspect a thing! Let's keep it that way!"

我微微前倾，给了他一个湿漉漉的大吻。“骗到你了！你做得不错，真嗣君！她一点都没怀疑！我们就这样保持下去吧！”

He was relieved, though he did look a little disappointed that we had to hide it from her.

他虽然松了一口气，但看起来还是有些失望，因为我们不得不对她隐瞒这件事。

"Just think about it. If she, or anyone at NERV found out we were sleeping together," I paused there for a moment and we both just looked at each other. 'Sleeping together' Wow. It sounded so… so adult... I quickly moved on. "If they found out, how quick do you think that they'd separate us and not let us see each other again?" I saw the recognition of what I was saying in his eyes. "That's right. So, for now, we have to keep this under wraps. Okay?"

想想看，如果她，或者 NERV 的任何人发现我们睡在一起，" 我停顿了一下，我们俩只是互相看着对方。'睡在一起'，哇，听起来好……好成熟……我赶紧继续说，"如果他们发现了，你觉得他们会多快把我们分开，不让我们再见面？" 我从他的眼神中看到了他对我所说的话的理解。"没错。所以，现在我们必须保密。好吗？"

He nodded. "Okay." 他点了点头。“好的。”

"Doesn't that make it more exciting?"

那不是更令人兴奋吗？

"I guess so." 我想是的。

"Bah! Where's your sense of adventure, Third Child?" He just smiled. The loveable dork.

"哼！你的冒险精神去哪儿了，第三子？" 他只是微笑着。这个可爱的呆子。

"Anyways," I said. "I'd better get to my room before Misato comes out of the shower! And put some clothes on for God's sake!"

“不管怎样，”我说，“我最好在我房间里等，免得美里洗完澡出来！而且拜托你穿件衣服吧！”

He blushed adorably as I quickly exited the room.

我迅速离开房间时，他可爱地脸红了。

"I love you Asuka!" He called after me.

"我爱你，明日香！" 他在我身后喊道。

I stuck my head back around his door. "You better!"

我又探头进他的门，说：“你最好这样！”

"Shit…. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit…. Fuck!"

该死…. 该死。该死。该死。该死。该死…. 操！

I think I may have mentioned earlier that I've always found profanity a great comfort in difficult times. How else was I supposed to respond when Misato had insisted, in fact she had ordered me, as a superior officer addressing a subordinate, to go to school that day?

我想我之前可能提到过，在艰难时刻，粗话总能给我莫大的慰藉。当那天美里作为上级军官，坚持甚至命令我这个下属去上学时，我还能怎么回应呢？

After the uncomfortable, but weirdly thrilling, interlude hiding under the desk when Misato had nearly caught us. I had scurried back to my room, thrown on a long T-shirt nightie and leapt into bed, my heart still pounding.

在那个既不舒服又诡异刺激的插曲之后，当美里差点抓到我们时，我躲在桌子底下。我匆匆回到房间，套上一件长 T 恤睡裙，跳上床，心脏依旧狂跳不止。

Misato had finished her shower surprisingly quickly that morning, and before too long she was pounding on my bedroom door.

那天早上，真嗣出奇迅速地洗完了澡，不久便开始猛敲我的卧室门。

"Time to get up, Asuka! You'll be late for school!"

该起床了，明日香！上学要迟到了！

"Uhhh… "I pretended to groan groggily. "Why should I?" The door slid open. My guardian stood there in her purple dressing gown, hands on her hips, her hair wrapped in a towel-turban.

"呃……" 我装作迷迷糊糊地呻吟道，"我为什么要这么做？" 门悄然滑开，我的监护人站在那里，身穿紫色晨衣，双手叉腰，头发用毛巾裹成头巾状。

"You know why Asuka!" she interrupted as I started to protest. "No buts or ifs! Shinji's forbidden from school for the moment, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna let both of you mope around the place giving each other dirty looks!"

"你知道为什么，明日香！" 她打断了我正要开始的抗议，"没有但是或如果！真嗣暂时被禁止上学，但我绝不允许你们俩在这里互相给对方脸色看！"

"But Misato… " 但美里……

"Don't make this any harder than it has to be! I've had a long night at NERV, I haven't slept in over twenty six hours, I don't have the energy for this. I am saying this as your commanding officer, get up and go to school, NOW!"

别把事情搞得比必须的还要复杂！我在 NERV 熬了一整夜，已经超过二十六小时没合眼了，实在没精力应付这个。我以你的指挥官身份命令你，立刻起床去上学！

Grumbling to myself I got out of bed and grabbed my stuff for the shower. Not even looking at Misato I brushed passed her and headed for the still steaming bathroom and slammed the door shut.

我一边嘟囔着，一边从床上爬起来，抓起洗澡用的东西。甚至没有看一眼美里，我就从她身边擦过，径直走向那间还冒着热气的浴室，砰的一声把门关上了。

After my shower I inhaled a granola bar in place of breakfast and stomped out of the apartment. My dark mood lifted quickly while I walked to school as the events of last night played back in my mind. My head was still buzzing from the sheer brain-frying intensity of the last 12-24 hours or so. I was still on a fuzzy high from all of the endorphins and sheer freedom I guess you would call it, that I had felt last night with Shinji. It all seemed so surreal, but I knew that it was no dream. For one thing I was feeling… well… a little tender, you know… down there. Though certainly not as much as I would have thought after my first time. First two times actually!

洗完澡后，我用一块格兰诺拉棒代替了早餐，然后重重地走出了公寓。在去学校的路上，昨晚的事件在我脑海中回放，我的阴郁情绪迅速消散。我的头脑仍然因为过去 12 到 24 小时那种令人头脑发热的强烈程度而嗡嗡作响。我想，我仍然沉浸在昨晚与真嗣在一起时感受到的所有内啡肽和纯粹自由所带来的模糊快感中。这一切似乎如此不真实，但我知道这不是梦。有一点我能感觉到……嗯……有点敏感，你知道的……在那下面。虽然肯定没有我想象中第一次（实际上是前两次）之后那么强烈。

I grinned to myself. Despite my argument with Misato my mood was happier than I could ever remember it being. The day seemed brighter, the citizens of Tokyo-3 no longer looked dead eyed and dreary to me that morning. They seemed purposeful, eager for new achievement. The air felt cleaner, crisper. Oh boy, I thought to myself, I've gotta get a grip before I get to school or Hikari will be all over me like Misato on a brewers van!

我暗自咧嘴一笑。尽管与美里发生了争执，但我的心情却比记忆中的任何时候都要愉快。那天似乎更明亮了，东京-3 的市民们不再显得眼神空洞、无精打采，那天早上他们看起来充满目标，渴望新的成就。空气感觉更清新、更爽脆。哦，天哪，我心想，我得在到学校前控制住自己，否则光会像美里追着啤酒车一样缠上我！

Anyway, it wasn't like Shinji and I would have been able to do anything with Misato asleep in the next room. She was a surprisingly light sleeper for a workaholic booze-hound.

再说，就算真有什么事，真嗣和我也不可能在美里就在隔壁房间熟睡的情况下做出来。她这个工作狂兼酒鬼，出人意料地睡得很浅。

I rounded the corner and walked down to the gate of the school. The one advantage of running late was not having to face Hikari's questions about my departure from school yesterday, or even worse facing Suzuhara, or any of the other Freakerati of class 2-A. I stuffed my backpack into my locker and crossed hall to the classroom door and slid it open.

我拐过转角，走向学校大门。迟到唯一的好处是不必面对光关于我昨天离校的追问，更糟的是面对铃原，或是 2-A 班其他那些怪人。我把背包塞进储物柜，穿过走廊，推开教室门。

Inside the Sensei paused mid drone to regard me owlishly through his coke-bottle glasses as I entered.

我进门时，那位老师傅正说到一半，透过他那瓶底厚的眼镜，像猫头鹰一样审视着我。

I bowed to the old fossil. "I apologise for my lateness, Sensei. I had um… NERV business to attend to this morning."

我向那位老古董鞠了一躬，“对不起，老师，我来晚了。今天早上我有点……NERV 的事务要处理。”

"Very good, Miss Soryu. Take your seat."

很好，索里乌小姐，请坐。

I scurried to my seat. The old man continued his lecture as I sat and got my laptop out from under my desk. From beside me Hikari gave me a concerned smile. I gave her a quick smile back to try to reassure her, hoping to avoid any further inquiries.

我急忙跑回座位。老人继续讲课，我坐下并从桌下取出笔记本电脑。旁边的光对我露出关切的微笑，我迅速回以微笑，试图让她放心，希望避免进一步的询问。

Thankfully none were coming at that moment, so I settled in for the school day.

幸好那一刻没有人来，于是我安顿下来准备上课。

Oh, sweet Jesus the mind numbing boredom of that school! Every second of it dragged into an eternity. All the while Shinji was waiting back at the apartment! All of the precious time with each other that this wizened old prune was chewing up with his fucking Second Impact Drivel! I thought I would scream with the frustration of it all.

哦，天哪，那所学校令人麻木的无聊！每一秒都被拖成了永恒。与此同时，真嗣还在公寓里等着我！我们宝贵的相聚时光，全被这个干瘪的老家伙用他那该死的第二次冲击废话给吞噬了！我真想尖叫，以发泄这所有的沮丧。

The morning session continued to crawl past with all the speed of a tree-sloth tripping on Mogadon.

上午的会议继续以服用镇静剂的树懒般的速度缓慢进行。

Lunch arrived, and my anxiety at having to lie to my best friend about what had happened yesterday was growing so that it felt like an entire army of butterflies had annexed the pit of my stomach. I needn't have worried though. Hikari, it appeared, felt responsible for the fact that I had left school seemingly upset yesterday, so she spent the lunch break prattling on about how her sister Nozomi was accepted into her junior school's band as second viola and how Hitomi from class 2-B was going out with Jun from our class's older brother and a million other trivialities of life that she thought would distract me from what she perceived as my dark mood. She truly was a good friend. Though I'm sorry to say that I zoned out for most of it. I had other things on my mind.

午餐时间到了，我对于不得不向最好的朋友撒谎，隐瞒昨天发生的事情的焦虑感愈发强烈，仿佛整个胃里都被一群蝴蝶占领了。不过，我其实不必担心。光似乎觉得昨天我看起来不高兴地离开学校是她的责任，所以她利用午餐时间不停地谈论她姐姐希美被选入初中乐队担任第二中提琴手，还有 2-B 班的仁美和我们班俊的哥哥交往，以及其他无数琐碎的生活小事，她以为这些能让我从她所认为的阴郁情绪中分心。她真是个好朋友。但遗憾的是，我大部分时间都走神了。我心里还有别的事情。

After lunch was the brief excursion into 'Lord of the Flies' that was Phys Ed class. Today's session was girl's track and field training. Tokyo-3 Middle School was going to be competing against Odawara Academy at the end of term sports carnival, and Mr Hirota, the P.E. Teacher, took the honour of the school very seriously. He stood at the centre of the school sports field with his red megaphone and barked instructions and trite motivational sayings at the students as they puffed and shuffled their way around the track.

午餐后是短暂的“蝇王”式体验——体育课。今天的课程是女生田径训练。东京第三中学将在期末体育嘉年华上与小田原学院竞技，体育老师广田先生对学校的荣誉极为看重。他手持红色扩音器站在学校运动场中央，向气喘吁吁、步履蹒跚绕着跑道行进的学生们大声发出指令和陈腐的激励话语。

I was picked for the 4 x 200 metre girls' relay team tryouts. Arbitrarily I was shoved into a team of four with the asthmatic Yuko Chiba, Hikari and much to my annoyance, Rei Ayanami. I really couldn't be bothered with this meaningless interschool crap anyway. Neither Rei nor myself would be allowed to travel to Odawara to compete due to NERV's standing operational orders that forbade Pilots and essential personnel from leaving the Tokyo-3 area without written permission from the Commander or Sub-Commander.

我被选中参加 4x200 米女子接力队的选拔。随意地，我被塞进了一个四人小组，成员包括患有哮喘的千叶由子、光，以及让我颇为不悦的绫波丽。说实话，我对这种毫无意义的校际比赛根本提不起兴趣。由于 NERV 的现行操作指令禁止驾驶员和关键人员未经指挥官或副指挥官书面许可离开第三新东京市区域，我和绫波丽都无法前往小田原参赛。

But, NERV was also keen for the Pilots to have as 'normal' a school life as possible. So we took part in the tryouts, pointless though they were.

然而，NERV 也希望驾驶员们尽可能拥有一个“正常”的校园生活。因此，我们参加了选拔赛，尽管它们毫无意义。

After a considerable amount of indecipherable shouting through Hirota-Sensei's megaphone we were lined up for the relay tryouts. I, of course, would run the first leg, then Hikari the second and Rei the third, with Yuko running the final leg and crossing the line. In first place, hopefully.

经过广田老师扩音器中传来的一阵难以理解的喊叫后，我们被排成一列准备接力试训。当然，我跑第一棒，接着是光跑第二棒，零跑第三棒，由优子跑最后一棒并冲刺过线，希望我们能取得第一名。

I took my position in the starting blocks with a certain degree of indifference. But I have to admit that my natural competitive spirit got the better of me and I grinned to myself as Hirota-sensei gave the starters orders and fired his cap gun to signal the beginning of the heat.

我带着几分漠然站在起跑器上，但不得不承认，我天生的竞争精神占了上风，当广田老师发出起跑指令并扣动发令枪开始比赛时，我暗自笑了。

I took off, my long legs and lean form easily outpacing the other five girls that were competing against me in this leg. It felt so good just to run, cleansing and pure just to be pushing myself as hard as I could without any real threat of consequences. I was already several lengths ahead when I rounded the bend to where Hikari was waiting for me. She started off and I slowed to match my pace to hers as I handed the baton over several metres before the line.

我迈开长腿，瘦削的身形轻松超越了与我同台竞技的另外五名女孩。奔跑的感觉如此美妙，纯粹而净化心灵，全力以赴却无需担忧后果。当我拐过弯道，远远领先时，光已经在那里等候。她接棒出发，我则放慢脚步与她同步，在终点线前数米处将接力棒稳稳传递。

Hikari wasn't a bad runner, not quite up to my standard, but quite a good runner over distance. The other girls had reeled her in a little but she was still in front by a short way when she handed the baton to Rei.

光并不是一个糟糕的跑者，虽然没有达到我的水平，但在长距离跑步中表现相当不错。其他女孩们稍微追上了她一些，但在她将接力棒交给零时，她仍然领先一小段距离。

Now Ayanami was a quite a revelation! Gripping the aluminium baton tightly she took off at an astonishing pace. Her pale arms and legs almost a blur as she opened up a healthy lead on the rest of the group. No expression showed on her face (did it ever?) as she streaked away from the field. Before any time had passed she had rounded the bend and was handing off the baton to Yuko.

绫波的表现真是令人惊叹！她紧握着铝制接力棒，以惊人的速度冲出起跑线。她那苍白的手臂和腿几乎化作一道模糊的影子，迅速拉开了与其他队员的距离。她的脸上依旧没有任何表情（她有过表情吗？），就这样从赛道上飞驰而过。转眼间，她已经绕过弯道，将接力棒交给了由子。

Ah, Yuko Chiba. I'm not sure if anyone has ever snatched defeat from the jaws of victory quite as convincingly as she did on that day. Rounding the final bend into the straight with still a comfortable margin over the next girl, she somehow managed to drop the baton. She claimed later that her hands were all sweaty from the tension of having to anchor the race for the Class Representative and two Evangelion Pilots. Whatever. All I know is that as it hit the ground in front of her she kicked it hard with her right foot as it swung forward and it sent the baton flying straight back up at such velocity that it struck her square in the face and broke her nose.

啊，千叶由子。我不确定是否有人能像她那天那样，如此令人信服地将胜利拱手让人。在进入直道前的最后一个弯道，她仍以明显的优势领先于下一位选手，却不知怎的掉了接力棒。她后来声称，因为要为班级代表和两位《新世纪福音战士》驾驶员压轴，手心紧张得全是汗。不管怎样，我只知道当接力棒落在她面前时，她右脚顺势一踢，棒子以惊人的速度反弹，直击她的脸部，导致鼻子骨折。

I must admit that it did look kinda funny as she fell and cartwheeled into a dusty heap about thirty metres shy of the finish line. Not for her, obviously, but hey…. You know….

我必须承认，当她摔倒并翻滚成一个离终点线约三十米的尘土堆时，那场面确实有点滑稽。当然，对她来说并非如此，但嘿……你知道的……

So Hikari and I sat, with Ayanami just off to the side of us, and watched with the rest of the girls in the class as Hirota-sensei barked unintelligible instructions through his loud-hailer and several of the school orderlies stretchered Yuko off the field and away to the tender mercies of the school nurse.

于是，光和我坐在一起，绫波稍微靠边一些，我们和班上其他女生一起，看着广田老师通过扩音器发出难以理解的指令，几名学校勤杂工用担架将优子抬离操场，送往学校护士的温柔照料之下。

"Typical." I said. "We had that race in the bag and then that klutz Chiba manages to turn it into an episode of 'Destroyed in seconds'! Sheesh!"

"真典型。" 我说，"那场比赛我们本已胜券在握，结果那个笨蛋千叶硬是把它搞成了《瞬间毁灭》的剧集！哎呀！"

Hikari rolled her eyes at me. "That's hardly fair Asuka!" She chided. "Poor Yuko didn't mean to fall over like that. Anyway I thought you said that you didn't care about the race."

光对我翻了个白眼，“那对飞鸟来说太不公平了！”她责备道，“可怜的由子并不是故意摔倒的。再说，我记得你说过你不在乎比赛的。”

"I don't! It's just embarrassing to have a great lead like that and lose the race due to someone else's stupid clumsiness!"

我可不这么认为！只是因为别人的愚蠢笨拙而输掉比赛，本来领先那么多，真是太丢脸了！

"Never mind! " She said. "It was a good race up until that point. You and Rei both were amazing out there Asuka! You were both way faster than any of the other girls!"

"没关系！" 她说，"在那之前，这是一场精彩的比赛。你和丽都表现得非常出色，明日香！你们俩的速度远远超过了其他女孩！"

"Naturally! I'm an elite Evangelion Pilot! Trained to the highest level by one of the World's top paramilitary organisations. Of course the other girls were no match for me. Even Wonder-doll over there could beat mere school girls in a stupid foot race!"

当然啦！我可是精英福音战士驾驶员！由世界顶尖准军事组织训练至最高水平。其他女孩子当然不是我的对手。就连那边的神奇玩偶都能在愚蠢的赛跑中轻松胜过普通学校女生！

"I am not a doll." Rei said quietly from where she sat a few metres away.

"我不是玩偶。" 蕾坐在几米开外，轻声说道。

"Shut up, doll!" I snarled, my anger flaring suddenly. "Don't argue with me unless you're ordered to!"

"闭嘴，玩偶！" 我怒吼道，怒火突然爆发。"没有命令，别跟我争辩！"

"Asuka…" Hikari said placatingly.

"明日香……" 光安抚地说道。

"I am not a Doll." She repeated.

"我不是玩偶。" 她重复道。

I was livid. "I said shut up! You are so a fucking doll!" I was up in Ayanami's face now. "Why, I bet that if the Commander decided he was going to destroy us all, you'd be the first in line to drink the Kool-Aid!"

我气得发疯。“我说了闭嘴！你真是个该死的玩偶！”我现在正对着绫波丽的脸。“哼，我敢打赌，如果指挥官决定要毁灭我们所有人，你肯定是第一个排队喝酷爱饮料的！”

She just stared back at me with those freaky damned eyes. I tried to stare her down. Intimidate her. Show her where she stood in the scheme of things. Also, I knew, she and Shinji had some history. I didn't know what. But I was damned if I was going to let her steal away my happiness when I had only just found it. She needed to know her place.

她只是用那双诡异的眼睛回瞪着我。我试图用目光压倒她，恐吓她，让她明白自己在事情中的位置。而且，我知道，她和真嗣之间有些过往。我不清楚是什么，但绝不允许她夺走我刚找到的幸福。她必须认清自己的位置。

She just stared back at me. The seconds passed. Hikari tried to move to come between us.

她只是回望着我。时间一秒秒流逝。光试图移动，想要介入我们之间。

"Come on, Asuka. Just let it go. Let's just enjoy the sunshine out here while we can!"

来吧，明日香，放手吧。趁现在，我们好好享受外面的阳光吧！

"Fine!" I said backing off a little. "No point wasting my breath on you anyway!"

"好吧！" 我稍稍退后说道，"反正跟你浪费口舌也没意义！"

I continued staring at her. Daring her to speak. Finally, and devastatingly, she did.

我继续盯着她，挑衅她开口。最终，她开口了，却带着毁灭性的力量。

"You smell like Ikari."

你闻起来像碇。

What? "What was that Rei?" Hikari asked.

什么？"那是什么，丽？"光问道。

"I was merely stating that Pilot Soryu smells like Pilot Ikari. It seems unusual to me."

我只是说驾驶员 Soryu 闻起来像驾驶员 Ikari。这对我来说似乎很不同寻常。

Ach… Mein Gott! I felt my face growing hotter and hotter.

啊……我的天！我感到我的脸越来越热了。

"Okay… "Hikari said. "That's a little weird, Rei. What do you mean by saying that Asuka smells like… "

"好吧…"光说，"这有点奇怪，丽。你说明日香闻起来像…是什么意思？"

She paused mid-sentence as she looked over at me. I'm sure that my face was beginning to glow with the amount of heat I could feel coming from it. I wanted to scream at Ayanami to shut up, I wanted to deny… Something…. I wanted to do something to divert her attention from my guilty blush, but I was stuck dumb by sheer embarrassment. Embarrassment and a strange sense of guilt that I still can't fully explain. I just hung my head and avoided her questioning gaze.

她说到一半突然停下，朝我这边望来。我确信自己的脸开始因为感受到的热度而泛红。我想要对绫波大喊让她闭嘴，我想要否认……某种东西……我想要做些什么来转移她对我羞愧脸红的注意，但我被纯粹的尴尬定住了，无法开口。那种尴尬和一种我至今仍无法完全解释的奇怪罪恶感交织在一起。我只是垂下头，躲避着她探询的目光。

"Asuka…?" Hikari repeated. "What's going on?"

"明日香…？" 光重复道，"发生了什么事？"

"N-Nothing!" I blushed even more.

"没...没什么！" 我的脸更红了。

"Then why does Ayanami say that you smell like Shinji? And, why are you blushing Asuka?"

那么，绫波为何说你身上有真嗣的味道？还有，明日香你为什么脸红呢？

"I-I'm not blushing!" I exclaimed fervently. "A-As if I would do anything with th-that dork anyway!" Even as I said it I felt a huge surge of guilt at calling him that. I knew that I would never be able to think of Shinji that way again.

"我、我才没有脸红呢！" 我热切地辩解道，"就好像我会和那个笨蛋做什么似的！" 尽管这么说，我心里却涌起一股强烈的愧疚感，因为这样称呼他。我知道，我再也无法用那种方式看待真嗣了。

"But Asuka, no-one even suggested that you've done anything with… "She paused for a moment and her eyes grew wide. "Oh my God!"

但明日香，没人暗示过你和……"她停顿了一下，眼睛瞪得大大的。"哦，我的天哪！"

"What?" I said, a sick feeling growing in the pit of my stomach.

"什么？" 我说道，一种恶心的感觉在胃里逐渐蔓延。

"You did it, didn't you?" She said excitedly.

"你做到了，对吧？" 她兴奋地说。

"D-Did it?" Holy Roller-Skating Vishnu! Was it that obvious? Was I unknowingly wearing a neon sign proclaiming my lost virginity to the greater Tokyo-3 metropolitan area?

"D-真的吗？" 天啊，滑轮维什努！有那么明显吗？难道我不知不觉中挂了个霓虹灯牌，向整个第三新东京都市圈宣告我失去了童贞？

"You confessed to Shinji, didn't you?" She almost squealed. "You told him how you felt! Oh My God! Asuka, that's so wonderful!" Hikari's genuinely joyful face beamed upon me as she swooped down and engulfed my in an enthusiastic embrace.

"你向真嗣表白了，对吧？" 她几乎尖叫起来。"你告诉他你的感受了！哦，我的天！明日香，这太美妙了！" 当她俯身热情地拥抱我时，光那张真诚喜悦的脸庞照亮了我。

I guess relief outweighed most of the other emotions that swamped me at that moment. Nobody suspected that Shinji and I had slept together, and it was kind of a relief to have someone to confide in. No one would be better than Hikari on that count.

我想，那一刻，宽慰感压倒了我心中大部分其他情绪。没人怀疑我和真嗣曾共度一夜，能有人倾诉，多少是一种解脱。在这方面，没有人比光更适合了。

As she finally released me from her clutches I simply nodded silently to her question. She squeed in delight. I could see the romantic soft-filtered images of 'Eva Pilots in Love' already playing in her head.

当她终于松开我时，我只是默默地对她的问题点了点头。她高兴地尖叫起来。我可以看到她脑海中已经浮现出《Eva 驾驶员恋爱记》中那种浪漫柔和的画面。

"So, "She said. "Tell me everything! Have you had your first kiss yet?"

所以，"她说。"告诉我所有的事！你已经有过初吻了吗？"

I wished so dearly for my tell-tale blush to go away. "Y-Yes."

我多么渴望我那泄露心事的脸红能消失。“是-是的。”

She gasped. "Oh my god Asuka! That's so soon! Aren't you worried about going too fast?" Before I could answer she continued. "So, how was it? Did you hold hands afterwards? Did you make him brush his teeth? How many times did you kiss? Did he tell you he loved you? Does he… "

她倒吸一口气，“哦，我的天啊，明日香！这也太快了吧！你难道不担心进展太快吗？”在我回答之前，她又继续问道：“那，感觉怎么样？你们之后牵手了吗？你让他刷牙了吗？你们亲吻了几次？他有没有说爱你？他……”

"Enough!" I cried finally after her barrage of questions showed no sign of ceasing. "To answer your question, it was really…nice. But we're taking it slowly." I lied. "So that means I don'twant this blabbed all over the schoolyard, okay?"

"够了！"在她连珠炮般的问题丝毫没有停歇的迹象后，我终于喊了出来。"回答你的问题，确实很...不错。但我们进展得很慢。"我撒了个谎。"所以这意味着我不想这件事在学校里到处传，明白吗？"

Hikari, to her credit, seemed almost hurt. "Of course, Asuka. I won't breathe a word of this to anyone."

光，值得称赞的是，她似乎真的受到了伤害。“当然，明日香。我绝不会向任何人透露这件事。”

"Not even Suzuhara?" “连铃原也不行吗？”

"I swear!" She said with a slight blush. I knew she had a thing for that moronic jock!

"我发誓！" 她略带羞涩地说道。我知道她对那个愚蠢的运动员有好感！

"You better! Or, so help me I'll…" I was interrupted by the bell for the end of the period. My gratitude to that bell was beyond measure.

你最好给我小心点！否则，我发誓我会……"我话还没说完，就被下课铃声打断了。我对那铃声的感激之情无法言表。

Hikari immediately stood up, her Class Representative training again coming to the fore.

光立即站了起来，她作为班级代表的训练再次显现出来。

"Come on everyone. Get changed and back to class! You have five minutes!" she yelled to the field in general. "We'll talk more about this later!" She said in an aside to me as she headed off to marshal the more recalcitrant students.

“大家快点，换好衣服回教室！你们只有五分钟！”她对着操场大声喊道。“这事我们回头再细说！”她一边对我说，一边去整顿那些更倔强的学生。

I turned from her and went to stand up. I stopped when I met the vivid red eyes of the First Child, who was just staring at me inscrutably.

我转过身，准备站起来。就在这时，我遇到了第一孩子那双鲜红而深不可测的眼睛，他正目不转睛地盯着我。

"Well, Wondergirl?" I said defensively. I had forgotten that she was there, and had, of course, heard everything. Dammit! "Jealous that I've stolen your Shinji away from you? You better not blab any of this to anyone at NERV, do you hear me? Or I'll do my best to make your life a living Hell!"

“怎么，神奇女孩？”我防备地说道。我忘了她还在那儿，当然，她听到了一切。该死！“嫉妒我抢走了你的真嗣吗？你最好别把这事透露给 NERV 的任何人，听见了吗？否则我会尽我所能让你的生活变成活地狱！”

"There is no need to threaten me Pilot Soryu. Nothing you could do would make my life any worse than it already is."

"无需威胁我，飞行员 Soryu。你做任何事都不可能让我的生活比现在更糟了。"

"What does that mean?"

那是什么意思？

"Do not worry. No one shall hear about your and Pilot Ikari's coupling through me."

不必担心，你和伊卡里飞行员的关系不会通过我泄露出去。

"Um… Good! They'd better not!" I said, a little nonplussed. Coupling?

“呃…好！他们最好不要！”我说，有点不知所措。连接？

"I hope that he finds happiness with you as his mate. It would do him good." With those enigmatic statements she gracefully rose to her feet and walked off without a backward glance.

我希望他和您作为伴侣能找到幸福，这对他有益。留下这番神秘的话后，她优雅地站起身，头也不回地离开了。

'Well,' I thought as I headed off to the girls change rooms, 'I dodged a bullet there, kind of…' Sure Hikari and Rei knew, but I thought that I had contained the damage as much as possible. I was sure that Shinji would agree with me.

我一边走向女更衣室，一边心想：“好吧，我算是躲过了一劫，算是吧……”当然，光和零是知道的，但我觉得我已经尽可能地控制了损害。我相信真嗣也会同意我的看法。

I hoped. 我曾抱有希望。

END CHAPTER 6 第六章结束

*Is "Placatingly" actually a word? It kinda feels like it should be, but my spell check didn't care for it one bit. Anyways, I left it in 'cos it felt right. You know how it is…

*“Placatingly”真的是个词吗？感觉上它应该是，但我的拼写检查完全不认可。不管怎样，我还是保留了它，因为感觉对了。你懂的……

Thought so. 果然如此。

Anyways… 无论如何…

## Chapter 7 Ich und Du 我与你

Another day, another weird sync test. Welcome to NERV. You are here. - .

又是奇怪的同步测试的一天。欢迎来到 NERV。你在这里。

At least it was nice to be out of the apartment after over two weeks of confinement. The days had passed slowly. Maddeningly slowly. The nights though, had been nothing short of magical. That first fortnight of Asuka's and my relationship had brought me such happiness as I would never have believed possible. It was like a physical void at the centre of my being was being filled. Yes, I know that I'm prone to sappy hyperbole, but that is the only way that I can describe how I felt. You have to remember where I was at, emotionally, at the very start of all of this.

至少在公寓里关了两个多星期后能出来走走，感觉还不错。日子过得很慢，慢得让人发疯。但夜晚却美妙无比。与明日香在一起的头两周带给我难以置信的幸福，仿佛我内心深处的空虚被填满了。是的，我知道我容易夸张，但这是我唯一能描述自己感受的方式。你必须记得，在这一切开始时，我的情感状态是怎样的。

To paraphrase one of those weighty Russian authors the old Sensei seemed to love even more than his interminable Second Impact reminiscences: My life before this had been most simple and most ordinary and therefore most terrible.

借用那位深受老先生喜爱的俄国大作家的话来改述：在此之前，我的生活极其简单、极其平凡，也因此极其可怕。

And Asuka. I'm sure that she felt something similar. I certainly could tell that she was happier. Or at least I felt that she seemed happier. It's not like she suddenly turned into Maria von Trapp or anything. Let's not get crazy here… It's just that… well… even though the barbs were still there and in front of Misato she still spoke to me as she always had… I could feel the warmth behind the façade.

还有明日香。我确信她也有类似的感受。我当然能察觉到她更快乐了。或者至少我觉得她看起来更快乐了。并不是说她突然变成了玛丽亚·冯·特拉普那样的人物，别想得太离谱……只是……尽管尖刻依旧，在美里面前她对我说话的方式一如既往……我能感受到那层伪装背后的温暖。

The old brash abusive Asuka Langley Soryu was just what was required to keep the outside World from becoming suspicious. The real Asuka, well only I got to see that. And she was beautiful beyond imagining.

桀骜不驯、言语刻薄的惣流·明日香·兰格雷正是用来防止外界产生疑心的必要人选。真正的明日香，我们只能窥见一斑。而她美得超乎想象。

I did feel bad for Misato having to work nights for all of that time, but I will admit that I was grateful for it. It gave the two of us the freedom that we needed. After dinner, most nights, we would study together, often holding hands across the kitchen table as we read. I would help Asuka with her Kanji and written Japanese and she would help me with physics and chemistry. I kind of feel that I got the better of the deal there.

我确实为美里不得不长时间上夜班感到难过，但我也承认对此心存感激。这给了我们俩所需的自由。大多数晚上，晚饭后，我们会一起学习，常常在餐桌对面手牵手阅读。我会帮助明日香学习汉字和书面日语，而她会帮我学习物理和化学。我总觉得在那笔交易中我占了便宜。

Later in the evenings we would retire to my bedroom. Strangely it was never hers. And there we would make love. Feeling the depth of our bond growing each time a little stronger. I relished the warmth and intensity of the feeling of being inside her. The small moans she made as we moved together and the way she clutched at my shoulders when she came. Then we would lie there, still in each other's arms as our breathing and heart rates slowly came back to normal. That was the magical time. The Afterglow, I've heard it called. That feeling of oneness with another person.

傍晚时分，我们常会回到我的卧室。奇怪的是，那从来不是她的房间。在那里，我们共沐爱河，感受着彼此的羁绊每一次都更加牢固。我沉醉于在她体内时的温暖与激情，她随着我们动作发出的轻声呻吟，以及高潮时她紧抓我肩膀的方式。之后，我们会躺在那里，依然相拥，呼吸和心跳渐渐恢复平静。那是魔幻时刻，人们称之为“余韵”。那种与另一个人融为一体的感觉。

Often we would talk. Sometimes about nothing in particular. Sometimes in painful depth. Yet, it felt good, cathartic. I told her about my Father and life with my Teacher. She told me about life in Germany, her time at University and one night, in a quavering voice, she told me about her Mother.

我们常常交谈。有时漫无目的，有时深入痛苦的话题。然而，这感觉很好，有净化心灵之效。我向她讲述了我的父亲和与导师的生活。她则向我讲述了在德国的生活、大学时光，以及某个夜晚，她声音颤抖地向我讲述了她的母亲。

I was horrified. Truly horrified. I felt such a fool for the seemingly indulgent self-pitying I had felt for myself. I had some horrible things in my past, but a Mothers rejection of her only daughter and then attempting a Murder-Suicide, and an indifferent father who abandoned you for another woman was just breathtakingly awful to me.

我感到震惊，真的震惊。我为自己那种看似放纵的自怜感到愚蠢。我的过去有些可怕的事情，但一个母亲拒绝她的独生女，然后试图谋杀自杀，以及一个冷漠的父亲为了另一个女人抛弃你，这一切对我来说简直是令人窒息的糟糕。

That night Asuka had just held me and cried quietly into my chest. All I could do was hold her and stroke her hair. I didn't say anything. What could I say to her that would make her feel better after that? Sometimes it's just better to say nothing.

那晚，明日香只是抱着我，在我怀里静静地哭泣。我所能做的，只是抱着她，轻抚她的头发。我什么也没说。在那之后，我又能说些什么来让她感觉好些呢？有时候，什么都不说反而更好。

Not every night was a joint therapy-catharsis session though. I certainly don't want to make it sound that way. I just want to show how far we had progressed in that short time. Though it didn't seem that short to us. The constant threat of Imminent Pointy Death can do strange things to your perspective.

并非每个夜晚都是联合治疗与宣泄的会话，我当然不想让它听起来如此。我只想展示在那短暂时间内我们取得的巨大进步，尽管对我们来说那似乎并不短暂。迫在眉睫的尖锐死亡威胁，确实能以奇特的方式改变你的视角。

So there we were. After two weeks confined to the Apartment I had finally been allowed out to take part in Dr Akagi's latest series of Synchronisation Tests.

于是，我们就这样。在公寓里被限制了两周后，我终于获准出来参加阿卡吉博士最新的同步测试系列。

Thus far we had been stripped, soaked, scrubbed, water-jet blasted, sandblasted, turbo blasted, vacuum dried and stuck naked in a tiny booth at one end of a long, ultra clean corridor. The small opaque door in front of me would have covered from just above my knees to just below my shoulders.

至此，我们经历了剥离、浸泡、擦洗、水射流冲击、喷砂、涡轮喷射、真空干燥，然后赤身裸体地被安置在一条长长的、极其干净的走廊尽头的一个小隔间里。我面前那扇不透明的小门，高度从我的膝盖上方延伸至肩膀下方。

I couldn't see the other two, but I knew that they were there. Or at least I knew Asuka was there.

我看不见另外两个人，但我知道他们就在那里。至少我知道明日香在那里。

"So, here we are, stripped naked and run through the wash cycle seventeen times!" She said with considerable impatience in her voice. "Why do we need to go through this crap anyway? And, dare I ask, why do we have to be naked?"

“所以，我们就在这儿，被剥得精光，还经过了十七次洗涤循环！”她带着明显的不耐烦说道，“我们到底为什么要经历这些破事？而且，我斗胆问一句，为什么非得光着身子不可？”

"We need to understand all of the variables that can affect synchronisation Asuka." Came Dr Akagi's voice over the P.A. "This test is to see what effect removing the interface of the plug suit will have on both Pilot sync ratios and performance of the Evangelions under a variety of conditions."

"我们需要了解所有可能影响同步的变量，明日香。"赤木博士的声音通过广播传来，"这项测试旨在观察移除插入栓服接口对驾驶员同步率和各种条件下福音战士性能的影响。"

"Sure. It just seems to me that an inordinate amount of NERV's 'testing' requires me being naked and/or probed in some highly invasive and deeply personal way!"

当然。只是在我看来，NERV 的所谓“测试”中，有太多时候需要我裸体，或者以一种极具侵入性和极度私密的方式被探查！

"All of NERV's test procedures and protocols meet with the United Nations Standard as specified in Article J-237 of the NERV Charter, 2013 Revision." Dr Akagi said in a tired voice.

“NERV 的所有测试程序和协议均符合联合国标准，正如 2013 年修订的《NERV 宪章》第 J-237 条所规定。”赤木博士疲惫地说道。

"That's not verycomforting." Asuka said sourly. "You say that every time I question any of the weird stuff that goes on around here!"

“这可真不让人安心。”明日香酸溜溜地说，“每次我一质疑这里发生的怪事，你都这么说！”

"So," The Doctor continued over the speaker in a more clipped tone, choosing to ignore Asuka's provocations. "If you would please continue down the hallway to the airlock door at the far end, we can finally get on with this test."

“那么，”医生通过扬声器用更为简短的语气继续说道，选择忽略明日香的挑衅。“请您继续沿着走廊走到尽头的气闸门，我们终于可以开始这项测试了。”

"What!" Asuka screeched. "You want me to walk, totally naked, all the way down this corridor? With El Pervo Shinji ogling my perfect body all the way? Not to mention the rest of you on that closed circuit camera on the wall? No way! I won't do it!"

"什么！"明日香尖叫道，"你要我一丝不挂地走过这条走廊？让那个变态真嗣一路盯着我完美的身体看？更别提你们其他人通过墙上的闭路摄像头窥视了？没门！我才不干！"

"Very well," Ritsuko sounded at the end of her patience. "The Audio/Visual feed from this section will be shut down for the next five minutes. You have that time to sort out amongst yourselves how you get from where you are to the other side of that Airlock. After that, we do it the hard way."

"很好，" 律子显然已忍无可忍，"这个区域的音视频信号将在接下来的五分钟内关闭。你们有这段时间来商量如何从你们所在的位置到达气闸的另一侧。之后，我们就得采取强硬手段了。"

"Uh…" I said. "What's the hard way?"

“呃……”我说，“什么是困难的方式？”

"I won't tell you." Dr Akagi answered. "But rest assured, I would enjoy it a lot more than you would."

"我不会告诉你的。" 赤木医生回答道，"但放心，我会比你享受得多。"

The red light on the CCTV camera on the wall blinked twice and faded to black.

墙上的 CCTV 摄像头上的红灯闪烁了两次，然后熄灭了。

"That woman is truly some kind of weirdo sadist." Asuka griped.

“那个女人真是个怪异的虐待狂。”明日香抱怨道。

The sound of my sigh was almost lost in the soft 'psssht' of one of the cubicle doors opening.

我的叹息声几乎淹没在其中一个隔间门轻轻打开的“嘶嘶”声中。

"Hey, Shinji-kun! Whatchya thinkin?" Asuka said, her grinning face suddenly appearing over the doorway in front of my cubicle.

"嘿，真嗣君！你在想什么呢？" 明日香说着，她那咧嘴笑的脸突然出现在我小隔间前的门口。

"Waaaaaah!" I yelped in shock.

"哇！" 我惊叫出声。

"Awww…" She pouted cutely. "I thought my little Shinji-kun would be happier to see his beloved than that!"

"哎呀…" 她可爱地撅起嘴，"我还以为我的小真嗣看到心爱的人会更开心呢！"

"But Asuka!" I said as softly as I could. "Rei is here too remember! I thought that we were trying to keep this a secret!"

“但是，明日香！”我尽可能轻声地说，“丽也在这里，记得吗！我以为我们是要保守这个秘密的！”

"There is no need to be concerned." Rei's voice came across from the cubicle where she stood. "Both Class Representative Horaki and I have been made fully aware of the fact that you and Pilot Soryu are coupled."

"无需担心。" 绫的声音从她站立的隔间传来，"班长堀越和我也完全清楚你和飞行员索留雨是搭档的事实。"

"What?" I exclaimed, dumbfounded. "Rei and Hikari know about us?"

"什么？" 我惊呼道，目瞪口呆。"零和光知道我们的事？"

"Welllll… Kind of." 嗯……算是吧。

"Kind of?" "算是吧？"

"Yeah. It was all Ayanami's fault! Anyway, Hikari just thinks that we're holding hands and kissing occasionally. Wondergirl here," She said with a jerk of her head in the direction of the next cubicle. "Just seems to have assumed that we've gone all the way!"

是啊，都是绫波的错！总之，光只是以为我们偶尔牵手亲吻而已。这位神奇女孩，她朝旁边的隔间一甩头说道，“似乎已经默认我们发展到那一步了！”

"B-But…" I stammered.

"It is natural, is it not, "Rei's disembodied voice echoed strangely in the empty space of the corridor. "When someone cares for another, to wish to perform the mating act with that person? Or with a surrogate."

"这是自然的，不是吗？" 零的空灵声音在走廊的空旷空间中回响得异常诡异，"当一个人关心另一个人时，希望与那个人进行交配行为，或者与一个替代者，不是很自然吗？"

"What?" Both Asuka and I exclaimed in unison.

"什么？" 我和明日香异口同声地惊呼道。

"Surrogate?" Asuka said. "What the Hell do you mean by that, Rei?"

"代孕？"明日香说道，"你这话到底什么意思，绫波？"

There was silence for a moment before Rei finally answered, her voice even softer than usual. "It is not important."

片刻的沉默后，丽终于回答了，她的声音比平时还要轻柔：“这不重要。”

"You're weird, Wondergirl!" Asuka said dismissively. As for me, I was troubled by Rei's words. But this was not the time to enquire further of the mysterious First Child.

"你真奇怪，奇迹女孩！" 明日香不屑地说。至于我，则被绫波的话困扰着。但此刻并非进一步探究神秘的第一适格者的时候。

There was a soft 'psssht' and suddenly Asuka was joined at my cubicle door by the blue hair and red eyes of Rei Ayanami.

传来一声轻柔的“嘶嘶”声，突然间，绫波丽的蓝发红眸出现在我的隔间门口，与明日香并肩而立。

"Waaaaaah!" Both Asuka and I exclaimed as I cowered in my cubicle, vainly trying to cover myself.

"哇啊啊啊！" 我和明日香同时惊呼，我在自己的隔间里蜷缩着，徒劳地试图遮掩自己。

"Hey, Wondergirl!" Asuka said angrily. "Stop ogling my Shinji!"

"嘿，神奇女孩！" 明日香生气地说，"别盯着我的真嗣看了！"

"Asuka…" I tried to interject.

"明日香……" 我试图插话。

"And you!" She swung around to me. "Get your eyes off Wondergirl, you pervert!"

"还有你！"她突然转向我，"别盯着神奇女孩看了，你这个变态！"

"There is no need to concern yourself, Pilot Soryu. This is not the first time Pilot Ikari has seen me in a state of undress."

无需担心，Soryu 驾驶员。这并非 Ikari 驾驶员第一次见到我衣衫不整的样子。

"Wha…" Asuka stared slack-jawed at Rei for a moment before turning back to me. Lord how I wished for the cold metal floor of that cubicle to swallow me whole then and there.

"什…" 阿苏卡目瞪口呆地盯着丽一会儿，然后又转向我。天哪，那一刻我多么希望那个小隔间冰冷的金属地板能将我整个吞没。

"A-Asuka… "I stammered. "I-It's not what you think… It w-was before y-you c-came here… Th-there w-was an accident with the c-card. I-I…"

"飞鸟……"我结巴着说，"这-这不是你想的那样……那-那是你来之前的事……那-那张卡出了点意外。我-我……"

Asuka turned away from my squirming and looked pointedly at Rei.

"Pilot Ikari speaks the truth. I don't believe that it was his intention to walk into my apartment while I was showering that day. I am also sure that his prolonged clasping of my breast when he fell on top of me was purely incidental. Though… " She said, with an almost strange look in her eye. "It was not unpleasant."

碇真嗣说的是实话。我不认为那天我洗澡时他走进我的公寓是故意的。当他倒在我身上时，他长时间地抓着我的胸部，我相信这完全是偶然的。尽管……”她说着，眼中闪过一丝异样的神色，“这并不令人不快。”

"Shinji… " Asuka growled dangerously.

"真嗣…" 明日香危险地咆哮着。

"Come, "Rei interrupted. "We must proceed through the air-lock before Dr Akagi grows impatient." With that she turned and walked down the long corridor to the air-lock door. Her pale body appearing almost to glow under the harsh fluorescent lighting.

"来吧，"绫打断道，"我们必须通过气闸门，免得赤木博士不耐烦了。"说完，她转身沿着长长的走廊走向气闸门。在刺眼的荧光灯下，她苍白的身体仿佛在微微发光。

'Psssht' Asuka pressed the release for my cubicle door.

'噗哧'一声，明日香按下了我隔间门的释放按钮。

SLAP! 啪！

My cheek stung with the force of Asuka's hand as it struck my cheek. Then the aforementioned hand clasped my own and dragged me out of the cubicle and down the corridor after Rei.

我的脸颊因明日香的手掌猛击而感到刺痛。随后，那只手紧握住我的手，拉着我在丽之后走出隔间，沿着走廊前行。

"We will talk about this later, Third Child!" She ground out through clenched teeth. She pushed me roughly through the airlock before her. I sealed it shut and stood in the tiny chamber while the light above the other door shone red. Suddenly there was a whoosh and my ears popped with the pressure change. Now the light shone green and I heard a metallic click as the door lock on that side disengaged.

"这事我们回头再说，三娃子！" 她咬紧牙关挤出这句话。她粗暴地将我推进气闸室，随后我将其密封。我站在狭小的空间里，只见另一扇门上的灯亮着红色。突然，随着一声呼啸，我的耳朵因压力变化而感到不适。紧接着，灯光转为绿色，我听到那边门锁解锁的金属咔哒声。

I opened the door and stepped through and into a curtained off area which led me straight to a small set of steps that led up to my designated test plug. I climbed in and settled awkwardly into the control centre. It felt a little violating somehow to feel my bare flesh sinking into the memory foam of the seat. I shook myself to rid myself of such thoughts.

我推开门，穿过一道帘子，径直来到一小段台阶前，台阶通向我指定的测试插座。我爬进去，尴尬地坐进控制中心。裸露的皮肤陷入座椅的记忆泡沫中，感觉有些被侵犯。我摇了摇头，试图摆脱这些念头。

I had a strange, but now familiar sensation as I knew that the plug was being hoisted from where I had entered it to its position inside the Simulation Body. I tried to get as comfortable as I could in this strange situation. Asuka would be just settling into her plug now too. I smiled to myself as I imagined her sitting nude at the controls of the sim-plug. It was a pleasant diversion from my current predicament, and I knew it would be a long sync-test. I thought that I might as well make the most of it.

当我意识到插头正从我进入的位置被吊起，移至模拟体内的位置时，一种既陌生又熟悉的感觉油然而生。我尽力在这奇特的情境中找到舒适。此时，明日香应该也刚坐进她的插头里。想到她赤身裸体坐在模拟插头的控制台前，我不禁微笑，这成了我当前困境中的一抹愉悦调剂。我知道同步测试将会漫长，心想不如好好利用这段时间。

Also, I needed to figure out a way to stop her being so pissed at me.

另外，我得想个办法让她别再那么生我的气了。

LCL flooded the test plug, feeling strangely oily against my skin.

LCL 浸满了测试插头，触感异常油腻地贴着我的皮肤。

The "SOUND ONLY" window opened up in front of me.

我面前弹出了一个“仅限声音”的窗口。

"Shinji." Dr Akagi's voice came over the com channel. "We'll be monitoring your vital signs and sync ratio for the next four hours. Just relax and try to clear your mind."

"真嗣。" 赤木博士的声音通过通讯频道传来，"接下来的四个小时，我们将监测你的生命体征和同步率。放松，尽量清空你的思绪。"

"Yes Ritsuko." I answered with a sigh that sent a couple of stray bubbles up into the LCL around me. I closed my eyes and leaned back into the seat.

"好的，律子。" 我叹了口气，几串零星的气泡随之升入周围的 LCL 中。我闭上眼睛，向后靠在座椅上。

Several long and boring hours later…

几个漫长而无聊的小时后……

"Well, that sucked!" 哎，那可真糟糕！

I looked up from where I was leaning on the rail of the NERV gunboat that had retrieved the sim-plugs from the Geofront Lake. I had been standing there watching as the crew went about securing the plugs onto the carrier of the mobile crane. This then transferred them onto the large flatbed truck that had pulled up at the small wharf that serviced the flotilla of NERV vessels which patrolled that body of water.

我从 NERV 炮艇的栏杆上抬起头，这艘炮艇刚从 Geofront 湖中回收了模拟插头。我站在那里，看着船员们忙碌地将插头固定在移动起重机的载具上。随后，这些插头被转移到一辆大型平板卡车上，这辆卡车停靠在为巡逻该水域的 NERV 舰队服务的小码头上。

"I-I think we got out of it quite lightly." I ventured.

“我觉得我们算是轻松脱身了。”我试探着说。

"Hmph… You would." Asuka answered. Somehow she managed to make the baggy grey coveralls that they had given us after we had been rescued look… well pretty hot actually. My own were uncomfortable and scratchy and didn't quite give me enough room in the erm… gentlemen's area as could have been hoped for. But on Asuka, they looked good. Really good.

"哼……你还真会。"明日香回答道。不知怎的，她竟能把救援后发给我们的那套宽松的灰色工作服穿得……嗯，确实挺性感。我自己身上的这套既不舒服又刺痒，而且男士部位的空间也不尽如人意。但在明日香身上，它们看起来很棒。真的很好看。

I could tell that she was still mad at me. I guess that I couldn't blame her. Rei's little revelation of our past encounter, for want of a better word, had made things a little awkward between us.

我能感觉到她还在生我的气。我想我也不能怪她。Rei 对我们过去那次相遇的小揭秘，姑且这么说吧，让我们的关系变得有些尴尬。

"It's just inelegant, is all." Asuka said suddenly. I gave her a questioning look and waited for her to continue. Finally she did. "The Evangelions are the proper way to defeat the Angels. Humanity's greatest creation piloted by the chosen elite in a duel to the death. Not by a glorified systems analyst in binary code! It's just not how things should be done."

“只是不够优雅罢了。”明日香突然说道。我向她投去询问的目光，等待她继续说下去。最终，她开口了：“击败使徒的正确方式是使用福音战士，这是人类最伟大的创造，由选中的精英驾驶，进行生死对决。而不是靠一个在二进制代码中自命不凡的系统分析师！这根本不是做事的正确方式。”

"But, Dr Akagi managed to defeat the Angel without any damage being done to the Magi or Central Dogma and what's more, no-one was hurt. Isn't that what really matters?" I said.

但是，赤木博士成功击败了使徒，没有对 MAGI 或中央教条造成任何损害，更重要的是，没有人受伤。这不正是真正重要的吗？我说道。

"That philosophy might appeal to you and your fuck-buddy Ayanami," She said with real bitterness in her voice as she gestured contemptuously over to where Rei stood by the bow of the ship. "But I will never believe that a faceless drone in some pseudo-military bunker shall ever be a match for a true warrior with a fierce fighting spirit. To think otherwise is to deny our humanity!"

“那种哲学或许能吸引你和你的炮友绫波，”她带着真切的苦涩说道，同时轻蔑地指向站在船头的绫波。“但我永远不会相信，某个伪军事掩体中的无名小卒能与真正拥有炽烈战斗精神的勇士相提并论。若这么想，就是在否定我们的人性！”

I sighed. That's what this was really all about.

我叹了口气。这才是这一切的真正意义所在。

"A-Asuka… "She turned to face me. Her eyes shining bright blue and her mouth set in a thin line.

"飞鸟……" 她转过身来面对我，眼中闪烁着明亮的蔚蓝色，嘴唇紧抿成一条细线。

"What?" "什么？"

"I know that you're pissed off because of what Rei said back there, and I-I don't blame you. But I swear… it was an accident! I slipped and fell and it all went horribly wrong! I would never… "

我知道你因为零刚才说的话很生气，我-我不怪你。但我发誓……那是个意外！我滑倒了，摔了一跤，结果一切都变得一团糟！我绝不会……

"You just don't get it, do you baka-Shinji?" She said, her voice hard and her expression unchanging. "I'm pissed off with you because you didn't tell me, you idiot! Haven't we shared enough together that you can finally trust me? If you keep something like this from me, only to have fucking Wondergirl do the big reveal, how do I know that you… "She leaned on the rail and hung her head, her hair hiding her pretty face. "How do you think it makes me feel that you don't trust me enough to tell me this stuff?"

"你就是不懂，对吧，笨蛋真嗣？" 她说道，声音冷硬，表情毫无变化。"我生你的气是因为你没告诉我，你这个傻瓜！我们共同经历了那么多，你难道还不能信任我吗？如果你对我隐瞒这种事，最后却让该死的奇迹女孩来揭晓，我怎么知道你……" 她倚在栏杆上，垂下头，秀发遮住了她美丽的脸庞。"你想想，你不信任我到连这些事都不告诉我，我会有多难受？"

I put my arm around her, despite her words, despite our being out in the open like we were, she didn't try to pull away or shrug me off.

尽管她说了那些话，尽管我们像这样在公开场合，她并没有试图挣脱或甩开我，我还是搂住了她的肩膀。

"I'm sorry Asuka." I felt her shoulders tense at my words. "I-I didn't think it was something that you would want to know! I never wanted to hurt you, I promise! Being with you this past few weeks, I hadn't even given it a thought, I swear! Please Asuka? Please find it in your heart to forgive a lowly baka for being so stupid!"

"对不起，明日香。" 我感觉到她听到我的话后肩膀一紧。"我...我没想到那是你想知道的事情！我从没想过要伤害你，我保证！和你在一起的这几周里，我根本就没考虑过那件事，我发誓！求你了，明日香？请在你的心里原谅一个愚蠢的笨蛋吧！"

She turned to face me, her eyes shining with tears. She slid my arm off from around her shoulder and held my hand tightly in both of hers. "Okay," She sniffed, and my heart soared. "No more secrets?"

她转过身来面对我，眼中闪烁着泪光。她轻轻将我的手臂从她肩上移开，然后用双手紧紧握住我的手。“好吧，”她抽了抽鼻子，我的心随之飞扬，“不再有秘密了吗？”

"I swear Asuka, no more secrets." She smiled at me the most beautiful and pure smile.

"我发誓，明日香，不再有秘密。" 她对我露出了最美丽、最纯净的微笑。

"Good! I forgive you for being a baka. If I didn't I never would have slept with you in the first place!" She said, trying to lighten the mood. "Just try to imagine how I felt, Shinji! What if you found out from someone else that I had , I dunno, made out with Toji or something…? …ack…." Suddenly she let go of my hand and doubled over.

"好啦！我原谅你这个笨蛋了。要是我不原谅，一开始就不会和你睡在一起！" 她试图缓和气氛说道，"试着想象一下我当时的心情，真嗣！如果从别人那里得知我和，比如说，和东治亲热了之类的…？…啊…" 突然，她松开了我的手，弯腰蜷缩起来。

"Asuka? Are you okay?" I said concerned.

"明日香？你还好吗？" 我关切地问道。

She straightened up again, with a remorseful grimace on her face. "Bleargh… "She said queasily. "I made myself do a little vom in my mouth just thinking about it!"

她再次挺直身子，脸上带着懊悔的苦笑。“呃……”她不安地说，“一想到这事，我就恶心得差点吐出来！”

I stared at her, dumbfounded, for a couple of seconds before it sunk in. Then I began to laugh. She looked at me in annoyance for a moment, but I just couldn't stop myself. It may have been the release of tension, or the look on her face, but I just found myself laughing uncontrollably. Asuka too, was unable to keep her pissed off expression for very long and she too began to laugh out loud at the ridiculousness of it all.

我盯着她，愣了几秒钟才反应过来。随后，我忍不住笑了起来。她恼怒地看了我一会儿，但我就是停不下来。或许是紧张感的释放，或是她脸上的表情，总之我发现自己笑得无法自控。连明日香也无法长时间保持生气的表情，她也因为这一切的荒谬而放声大笑起来。

Now there were tears running down her pale cheeks, and mine too. But now they were true and unfettered tears of pure joy and relief. It felt good, healthy even to have such a release after the tension between us and the uncertainty during the Cyber-Angel attack.

此刻，她的苍白脸颊上泪珠滚落，我的亦是如此。但这些泪水是真挚而自由的，充满了纯粹的喜悦与释然。在经历了我们之间的紧张关系和网络天使攻击期间的种种不确定后，这样的情感释放让人感觉良好，甚至健康。

Finally, naturally, our laughter began to subside. Slowing down until a comfortable silence settled between us. She took my hand in hers again and looked straight at me, her eyes still shining and bright from the tears, but also with something else.

最终，自然而然地，我们的笑声开始减弱。渐渐放缓，直至我们之间弥漫开一种舒适的静谧。她再次握住我的手，直视着我，她的眼睛因泪水而依旧闪亮，却又带着些许别样的情感。

"You will make this up to me, Tonight, Baka-Shinji." She said in a low sultry voice.

"你得在今晚补偿我，笨蛋真嗣。" 她用低沉而撩人的声音说道。

I gulped in mock terror and nodded. She favoured me again with that beautiful smile that she seemed to have only for me.

我装作惊恐地深吸一口气，点了点头。她再次对我露出了那似乎只为我而存在的美丽笑容。

"I love you, Asuka."

我爱你，明日香。

"You better!" She replied, giving my hand a tight squeeze.

"你最好了！" 她回答道，紧紧地握了握我的手。

We stood there like that for quite some time, until finally Misato turned up in a black SUV with a red NERV symbol on the side. She waved at us as she got out of the driver's side door.

我们就那样站在那里好一阵子，直到最后，一辆黑色 SUV 带着红色 NERV 标志出现在我们面前，美里从驾驶座一侧的门出来，向我们挥手。

"Come on Shinji." Asuka said, giving my hand one last squeeze before letting go and waving back to Misato. "Let's go."

"来吧，真嗣。" 明日香说着，在放手前最后一次紧握了我的手，然后向美里挥手回应，"我们走吧。"

Misato drove Asuka and I home after the short de-brief session. We had not been involved in the battle for once, so very little was required of us after we had returned to central dogma. So the two of us were sent home. Rei, it seemed, was required for more 'tests' so she stayed behind at NERV. I showered quickly in the locker rooms. Eagerly looking forward to walking back to the apartment with Asuka. No dice. The daylight was beginning to fade outside the Geofront, so Misato was insisting that she drive us home.

简报会结束后，美里开车送我和明日香回家。这次我们没有参与战斗，所以回到中央教条后几乎没什么事需要我们做，于是我们俩就被打发回家了。而绫波似乎还需要进行更多的“测试”，所以她留在了 NERV。我在更衣室迅速冲了个澡，满心期待能和明日香一起走回公寓。可惜没戏，因为地表外的大白天已经开始暗淡，美里坚持要开车送我们回家。

"Come on, I haven't seen much of you guys lately! Let me at least drive you home!" She said.

"来吧，最近都没怎么见到你们！至少让我开车送你们回家！" 她说道。

Reluctantly we agreed. Tokyo-3 was one of the safest cities in the World. There was no danger in Asuka and I walking home in the dark. In fact we both felt safer walking home in the dark than we did driving with Misato! But our guardian wouldn't take no for an answer, so we dutifully piled into the ancient blue Alpine A310, Asuka on the front and me in the back. We were treated to a truly stomach turning trip into terror and back to our residence.

我们勉强同意了。第三新东京市是世界上最安全的城市之一。我和明日香在黑暗中走回家并没有危险。事实上，我们俩都觉得在黑暗中走回家比和美里一起开车更安全！但我们的监护人不容拒绝，于是我们乖乖地挤进了那辆古老的蓝色阿尔派 A310，明日香坐前面，我坐后面。我们经历了一次真正令人胃部翻腾的恐怖之旅，然后回到了住处。

"You two seemed very cosy on that boat this afternoon Shinji!" Misato said, turning her head back to wink at me, completely taking her eyes off the road in the process.

"今天下午在船上你们俩看起来可真亲密啊，真嗣！" 美里说着，转过头来对我眨了眨眼，过程中完全没看路。

"Will you watch where you're driving, for fuck's sake Misato!" Asuka screeched as out guardian miraculously missed sideswiping a parked Mercedes by what seemed like nanometres.

"你开车能不能看着点，天哪，美里！" 明日香尖叫道，我们的监护人奇迹般地以纳米级的差距避开了擦撞一辆停着的梅赛德斯。

"Yeah yeah, calm down Asuka!" she said nonchalantly. Spurring the poor car up to 85 kilometres an hour in a 50 zone. "Where I come from, ladies don't use that kind of language!"

"好了好了，冷静点，明日香！"她漫不经心地说道。在限速 50 的区域里，她把那辆可怜的车加速到了每小时 85 公里。"在我来的地方，女士们可不会说那种话！"

"Yeah, well, the people where you come from can kiss my ass!" Asuka replied.

"是啊，哼，你老家的人可以亲我的屁股了！" 明日香回答道。

Misato pursed her lips for a second at this, before moving on. "So, you guys got any big announcements for me?"

听到这个，Misato 抿了抿嘴唇，随后继续说道：“那么，你们有什么重要的事情要告诉我吗？”

"W-Wha-What d-do you m-mean… "I stammered from the back.

"你、你这是什么意思……" 我结结巴巴地从后面说道。

"You two were standing pretty close at that rail when I turned up. Do I smell a budding romance in the air?"

我出现时，你们俩在那栏杆旁站得挺近的。空气中是不是弥漫着萌芽的爱情气息呢？

"The only thing budding in the air that I can smell is what you're smoking if you think that I would ever touch perverted Shinji here with a barge-pole."

空气中唯一让我能嗅到的萌芽，就是你若认为我会用长杆触碰这个变态的真嗣，那你的想法真是太荒谬了。

I knew she didn't mean it, I knew it. But it still stung a little.

我知道她不是故意的，我明白。但心里还是有点刺痛。

"Hmph! You're no fun!" Misato pouted.

"哼！你真没劲！" 三佐噘起了嘴。

We reached the apartment in short order and I quickly moved into the kitchen to prepare dinner for the three of us. Misato grabbed two cans of beer from the fridge and plonked herself down at the kitchen table. Without a word she cracked the first one open and chugged it down in one gulp, slamming the empty can down on the table emphatically.

我们很快到达了公寓，我迅速走进厨房为三人准备晚餐。美里从冰箱里抓了两罐啤酒，一屁股坐在餐桌旁。她一言不发地打开第一罐，一饮而尽，然后将空罐重重地拍在桌上，态度坚决。

"Yeeeeeeeeaaaah!" She screamed ecstatically. "That's what I'm talking about!"

"What?" I said, turning from the stove top.

"什么？" 我说着，从炉灶前转过身来。

"Huh?" Misato said opening the second Yebisu.

"嗯？" 葛城美里说着，打开了第二罐惠比寿啤酒。

"Just ignore her Shinji. The beer will do the talking for both of them from now on."

别理她了，真嗣。从现在开始，啤酒会替他们俩说话的。

"Don't be mean!" Misato said, taking a more measured sip out of the can.

"别小气了！" 葛城说，从罐子里更加谨慎地抿了一口。

"Whatever… Anyway, shouldn't you be at work?" Asuka said. "There was an Angel attack today after all. Or is it now NERV SOP for its Operational Director to get blind drunk after any critical incidents?"

"随便吧…话说，你不是应该在工作吗？"明日香说道，"毕竟今天发生了天使袭击事件。难道现在 NERV 的操作规程是，每次重大事件后，其作战指挥官都要喝得酩酊大醉吗？"

"Nope." Misato replied with a smile. "But Ritsuko needs to do a thorough diagnostic scan on the MAGI before we can even begin to do a Deconstruct, Determine and Debrief on this one. So I get the night off! Isn't that nice?"

"没有。" 葛城美里微笑着回答，"但律子需要先对 MAGI 进行彻底的诊断扫描，我们才能开始进行解构、确定和汇报。所以我今晚放假了！这不是很好吗？"

"Wonderful…" Asuka said sarcastically. She looked at me from over Misato's head and rolled her eyes and grimaced. I could pretty much read her thoughts.

"太棒了……" 明日香讽刺地说道。她从美里头顶上方看向我，翻了个白眼，还做了个鬼脸。我几乎能读懂她的心思。

We sleep alone tonight. 今晚我们独自入眠。

Bummer. 真糟糕。

I served up the stir fry into the bowls and placed them on the table.

我将炒菜盛入碗中，并将其摆放在桌上。

"Oooh! Yummy!" Misato said tucking into her bowl immediately. This was just as well. If she had seen the disappointment etched on both of our faces things could have got awkward.

"哦哦！真好吃！" 碇真嗣立刻大口吃起碗里的食物。幸好她没看到我们俩脸上的失望表情，否则场面可能会变得尴尬。

Asuka visited me that night. I couldn't sleep anyway. My bed felt so wrong with just me in it. I had lain there for what felt like hours and still no rest would come to me. Then, the door slid open and there she stood, in her light cotton nightie.

那天晚上，明日香来找我了。反正我也睡不着。床上只有我一个人，感觉很不对劲。我躺在那里，仿佛过了好几个小时，却依然无法入睡。这时，门轻轻滑开了，她就站在那里，穿着轻薄的棉质睡裙。

She tip-toed over to my bed – Our Bed – and slid in under the covers. Silently we embraced and kissed urgently, pressing our lips and bodies together in our need.

她蹑手蹑脚地走到我的床边——我们的床边——然后钻进被窝。我们默默地拥抱，急切地亲吻，迫切地将嘴唇和身体紧贴在一起。

"I can't do this!" She breathed.

"我做不到这个！" 她喘息着说。

"It's just for one night! Probably…" I answered. "She said herself that once Ritsuko finishes her diagnostics she'll be busy with the fallout from the Angel! Tomorrow night we can be together again!"

"就这一晚而已！可能吧……"我回答道，"她自己说了，等律子完成诊断后，她就得忙于处理天使事件的余波！明晚我们就能再在一起了！"

"But what about after that? What happens when she is back to being home every night? I… I can't take more nights like this, Shinji! I can't be alone again!"

但那之后呢？当她每晚都回家时会发生什么？我……我无法再忍受这样的夜晚了，真嗣！我不能再孤单一人了！

I could see the moisture glimmering in her eyes in the moonlight from the window. I kissed her again, gently on the forehead.

我能看见月光透过窗户，在她眼中闪烁的湿润。我再次吻了她，轻柔地落在她的额头。

"We'll find a way, Asuka. I promise! Didn't I say that we would always be together? Didn't I say that I would never leave you?"

我们会找到办法的，明日香。我保证！我不是说过我们会永远在一起吗？我不是说过我永远不会离开你吗？

She nodded silently. 她默默地点了点头。

"Then trust me. I won't let anything come between us."

那么请相信我，我不会让任何事情阻碍我们之间的感情。

She clutched to me tightly.

她紧紧地抓住了我。

"I love you Asuka." 我爱你，明日香。

"You better!" 你最好了！

## Chapter 8 Like Some Watcher of the Skies 就像凝视苍穹的守望者

"Come on, Asuka! Where's the harm in letting me? Just this once?"

来吧，明日香！让我这么做有什么坏处呢？就这一次嘛？

"Absolutely not!" 绝对不行！

"You're so mean! It's not like I'm going to do anything weird! I just… "

你太刻薄了！我又不会做奇怪的事！我只是……

"No, Hikari!" I said in exasperation. "For pity's sake, you're like a dog with a bone! I can't let you! It's… complicated."

不，光！" 我无奈地说，"看在上帝的份上，你就像个咬着骨头不放的狗！我不能让你这么做！这……很复杂。

The pig-tailed girl pouted at me. "Meanie. You just don't want anyone to take his attention away from you. Why not let me come and see him and you together? I bet it would be so adorable!"

扎着马尾辫的女孩对我撅起了嘴。"小气鬼。你就是不想任何人分散他对你的注意力。为什么不让我来见见你们俩呢？我敢打赌那一定很可爱！"

I sighed. If Hikari wasn't such a good friend, I would have been getting really annoyed with her by now. Instead of just being mildly annoyed, like I currently was. She had been pestering to let her me to come and visit the apartment for days now. She said it was her duty as Class Representative to ensure the wellbeing of all of the students in her care. I didn't buy it. Not for one second.

我叹了口气。如果光不是这么好的朋友，我可能早就对她感到非常恼火了。而现在，我只是有些轻微的恼怒。她已经缠着我好几天，非要来参观我的公寓。她说作为班长，确保所有学生的福祉是她的责任。我对此一点也不信。连一秒钟都不信。

Since that day on the sports field I had seen Hikari looking at me with an almost unbearable expression of gooey-eyed happiness. I was obvious to me that the whole 'Eva Pilots in Lurve' romantic bullshit had been playing on a virtually continuous loop in her sentimental brain ever since. And today, as we sat and ate our lunches together on that Friday in the otherwise unoccupied quadrangle just outside of the school library, she was really starting to ramp up the pressure.

自从那天在运动场上，我就注意到光用一种几乎让人难以忍受的、充满幸福的眼神看着我。显然，自从那时起，她那感性的大脑里就一直循环播放着“恋爱中的伊娃飞行员”这种浪漫的胡言乱语。而今天，当我们在学校图书馆外那个几乎无人的四合院里一起吃午饭时，她真的开始加大了压力。

"Why won't you let me come and visit you Asuka?" She asked again plaintively. "Kodama says it's because you're jealous and worried that I'll try and steal Shinji away from you." She blushed a little. "Kodama also says that it's more likely because you're too busy 'Riding his Salami Stallion' as she put it, to want to spend time with your best friend, but I told her that you're not that kind of girl. Not like she is."

为什么你不愿意让我来拜访你呢，明日香？" 她再次哀怨地问道。"小田说是因为你嫉妒，担心我会试图把真嗣从你身边夺走。" 她脸上泛起一丝红晕。"小田还说，更可能是因为你太忙于'驾驭他的香肠战马'，就像她说的那样，以至于不想和你的好朋友共度时光，但我告诉她，你不是那种女孩。不像她那样。

I would have blushed at her being so close to the truth, but I'm sure that her other revelation made the colour drain from my face.

如果她的话接近真相，我本会脸红，但她另一番话却让我面色苍白。

"Wait a minute… You told Kodama?"

等一下…你告诉小田了吗？

Suddenly Hikari seemed fascinated by her black school shoes and couldn't bring herself to meet my eyes. "Well… er… yes."

突然间，光似乎对她的黑色校鞋着了迷，无法鼓起勇气与我对视。“嗯…呃…是的。”

"Hikari!" 光！

"Well… it's just… I couldn't tell anyone else… a-and you're not around to talk to very much lately…. She's my oldest sister… She knew something was bugging me…" Suddenly she clutched at my arm. "Please don't be angry with me Asuka! I-I didn't mean to betray your trust… S-She forced me to tell her! And it's not like she knows anyone in our class! She… she made me…" She sniffled, trailing off.

"嗯…其实…我没法跟别人说…而且你最近也不常在身边…她是我大姐…她察觉到我有心事…" 突然，她抓住了我的胳膊。"请不要生我的气，飞鸟！我不是故意要辜负你的信任…是她逼我说的！而且她又不认识我们班的人！她…她逼我的…" 她抽泣着，声音渐渐低了下去。

I couldn't stay angry at her, not after that performance. And I knew how much she looked up to her big sister since their Mother had died. Hikari's problem was that she was just too honest. All Kodama had to do was push the right buttons and Hikari's resolve would crumble and she would tell her anything.

我无法对她生气，尤其是在那场表演之后。我知道自从她们的母亲去世后，她有多么崇拜她的姐姐。Hikari 的问题在于她太过诚实。Kodama 只需按对按钮，Hikari 的决心就会崩溃，她会告诉她任何事情。

There were times I was almost happy that I didn't have any family to manipulate me like that. Almost…

有时候，我几乎庆幸自己没有家人那样操控我。几乎……

"Fine!" I said in mock ire. "But I have your word, as my best friend and as the Class Representative, that you have told, and you will tell, no one else about this?"

"好吧！"我佯装生气地说，"但你以我最好的朋友和班长的身份向我保证，你已经告诉了，并且将来也不会告诉其他人这件事？"

Another sniffle. Dear God, she was breaking my heart. "Y-Yes Asuka."

又是一声抽泣。天啊，她让我心碎。“是-是的，明日香。”

"Good. Now cheer up! In fact you can come around tonight if you like."

好的，现在振作起来！其实如果你愿意，今晚可以过来。

"Are you sure?" She said, her watery eyes wide.

"你确定吗？" 她问道，水汪汪的眼睛睁得大大的。

"Absolutely." I replied. "But no putting any moves on my Shinji!"

"绝对不行。" 我回答道，"但别对我家真嗣动手动脚的！"

"Asuka! As if I would… "

"明日香！我怎么可能……"

I just laughed at her earnestness. She looked at me puzzled for a second before she caught on and started to giggle as well. It was almost impossible to feel awkward around Hikari. Her heart and her open and welcoming manner, belied by her imposing Class Rep façade, were one of the pure joys of my time in that crap-hole of a school.

我只是对她的一本正经笑了笑。她困惑地看了我一秒，随即恍然大悟，也跟着咯咯笑起来。在光身边，几乎不可能感到尴尬。她那颗心和她开放热情的态度，与她那威严的班长外表相悖，是我在这所糟糕学校时光中的一大乐事。

She was a true friend.

她是一个真正的朋友。

"Tadaima!" 我回来了！

"Okaeri! I'm in the kitchen!"

欢迎回家！我在厨房呢！

I gestured to Hikari to be quiet as we took our shoes off in the entryway. She nodded seriously at me before letting out a small girlish giggle.

在玄关脱鞋时，我示意光保持安静。她认真地向我点了点头，随后发出了一声少女般的轻笑。

"Hikari!" I hissed at her admonishingly.

"光！" 我严厉地低声警告她。

"Is everything okay out there, Asuka?" Shinji called out from the kitchen.

"外面一切都还好吗，明日香？" 真嗣从厨房喊道。

"Yep, just fine!" I replied, feeling more than a little annoyed with my best friend who was quivering with excitement at my shoulder. We made our way down the hall and got to the entryway to the kitchen. Shinji stood at the sink with his back to us, rinsing some vegetables or something like that. Something cook-like anyways.

"嗯，挺好的！"我回答道，心中对那位在我肩旁因兴奋而颤抖的挚友感到有些恼火。我们沿着走廊前行，来到了厨房的入口。只见真嗣背对着我们站在水槽边，正冲洗着一些蔬菜之类的东西，总之是烹饪相关的活儿。

"Erm… Shinji…" Was all that I managed to get out before a brown-haired-pig-tailed-flash crossed the distance between us and had the poor unsuspecting fool in a full blown bear hug. He had just tried to turn to face me with the colander of washed vegetables in his hands when the moment of impact occurred. He managed to save most of the contents, though several bok choy leaves and a couple of sliced carrots scattered onto the kitchen floor.

"呃… 真嗣…" 我刚开口，一个棕色马尾的影子就迅速掠过我们之间的距离，给那个毫无防备的可怜家伙来了个结实的熊抱。他正试图转过身来面对我，手里还拿着洗好的蔬菜筛子，就在那一刻，撞击发生了。他设法保住了大部分蔬菜，但还是有几片小白菜叶和几根切好的胡萝卜散落在了厨房地板上。

I was more than a little annoyed to see her holding my Shinji like that. Though it was more than countered by the priceless look of confusion and terror on his face as the normally composed Class Rep prattled on incontinently at him, me and the apartment in general.

看到她那样抱着我的真嗣，我感到相当恼火。然而，平日里镇定自若的班长滔滔不绝地对着他、我以及整个公寓喋喋不休时，真嗣脸上那混杂着困惑与恐惧的珍贵表情，又让我心中的不快得到了极大的抵消。

"Oh Shinji, I'm so happy for you and Asuka! I knew that you two were meant to be together as soon as I first saw you doing your sync-training! Are you going to announce it at school? Are you going to tell Miss Katsuragi?" She stopped mid-flight and let go of Shinji, looking at him sternly. "Are your intentions towards Asuka completely Honourable? Oh, of course they are! You're not like those other perverted boys, are you Shinji?"

哦，真嗣，我真为你和明日香感到高兴！我一看到你们俩同步训练，就知道你们注定要在一起！你打算在学校宣布吗？你会告诉葛城小姐吗？" 她中途停了下来，松开了真嗣，严肃地看着他。"你对明日香的感情是完全纯洁的吗？哦，当然是的！你和那些其他好色的男孩不一样，对吧，真嗣？"

"Well… I… " 嗯……我……

"Geez Hikari! We're just going out! Give us some time before you have us picking out baby names!"

哎呀，光！我们只是出去而已！给我们点时间，别急着让我们挑宝宝名字啊！

Hikari, and rather adorably, Shinji both blushed.

光和相当可爱地，真嗣两人都脸红了。

"Asuka!" The other girl replied. "I'm your best friend! I have a right to make sure that your best interests are taken into consideration! What if Shinji's rampaging Man-hormones get the better of him and he tries to take advantage of you? What would you do then?"

"明日香！"另一个女孩回应道，"我是你最好的朋友！我有权利确保你的最佳利益被考虑进去！如果真嗣那狂暴的男性荷尔蒙占了上风，他试图占你便宜怎么办？那时候你该怎么办？"

Shinji blushed even more hugely, but I, I'm glad to say, was far more composed.

真嗣的脸红得更加厉害了，但我很高兴地说，我远比他镇定。

"If Shinji tried to take advantage of me, without my permission, he knows what would happen!" I saw the Third Child blanch slightly at the implied threat, so I quickly winked at him to show that I wasn't serious. He swallowed loudly and nodded at me. Hikari, meanwhile, blushed even more.

"如果真嗣未经我允许就想占我便宜，他知道会有什么后果！" 我看到第三适格者因这隐含的威胁而脸色微变，于是我迅速向他眨眼示意我并非认真。他大声吞咽了一下，向我点头。与此同时，光的脸更红了。

"What do you mean, 'without my permission'?" She gave a small gasp. "You don't mean… "

"你说的'未经我允许'是什么意思？" 她轻声惊呼，"你不会是说……"

"I mean, mind your own damn business, Hikari!" I said a little more bluntly than I had intended. Finally the message got through.

“我是说，管好你自己的破事，光！”我说话比预想的更直接了些。最终，这信息算是传达清楚了。

"Sorry Asuka, sorry Shinji." She said sheepishly. "I guess that I did kinda make a fool of myself just now."

"对不起，明日香，对不起，真嗣。" 她有些不好意思地说，"我想我刚才确实有点出丑了。"

"Yep, you surely did!" 是的，你确实做到了！

There was a moment's awkward silence.

有那么一瞬间，气氛尴尬地沉默了。

"Well," Shinji said. "I'd better wash these vegetables again and start making dinner."

"嗯，" 真嗣说，"我还是把这些蔬菜再洗一遍，然后开始做晚饭吧。"

"Cool!" I replied. "Hikari and me will be in the lounge watching TV!"

"太棒了！"我回答道，"光和我会在休息室看电视！"

"Sure. Hey Hikari?" 当然。嘿，光？

"Yes Shinji?" "什么事，真嗣？"

"Would you like to um... stay for dinner?"

"你想不想...留下来吃晚饭？"

"Thank you Shinji! But I can't. I promised Dad that I would be home by 6:30 to help Nozomi with her French homework."

谢谢你，真嗣！但我不能去。我答应了爸爸会在 6 点半前回家，帮望美做她的法语作业。

"Okay, maybe another time then?"

好的，那或许改天吧？

"Sure, I'd love to try your famous cooking Shinji!" She smiled sweetly at him.

"当然，我很想尝尝你著名的厨艺，慎二！" 她对他甜甜一笑。

I grabbed her by the arm and led her into the lounge. Once the TV was turned on to cover our conversation I turned to her.

我抓住她的胳膊，带她进了休息室。打开电视以掩盖我们的谈话声后，我转向她。

"What the fuck was all of that about?" I said angrily.

"这他妈都是些什么破事？" 我愤怒地说道。

"What?" Said the pig-tailed girl startled.

"什么？" 扎着马尾辫的女孩惊讶地说。

"Don't give me 'What?' all innocent like that Hikari! What was all of that "I'd love to try your famous cooking" crap? What are you doing flirting with my Shinji?"

别给我装无辜地说“什么？”光！那些“我很想尝尝你著名的厨艺”的废话是怎么回事？你干嘛要跟我家慎二调情？

She looked back at me stunned for a few moments before unexpectedly beginning to laugh.

她愣愣地回头看了我几秒，然后出乎意料地笑了起来。

"What?" I said annoyed. "What's so funny?"

"什么？" 我有些恼火地说，"有什么好笑的？"

"Teehee… Oh Asuka… it's so adorable." She said still giggling. "You're jealous!"

"嘻嘻……哦，阿苏卡……真是太可爱了。" 她一边说一边还在咯咯笑。"你吃醋了！"

"I… I am not!"

"我… 我不是！"

"Oh yes you are! That's sooo sweet! You really do love him!"

哦，是的，你确实如此！真是太甜蜜了！你真的非常爱他！

I sighed. "You really are hopeless sometimes."

我叹了口气。“你有时候真是没救了。”

She just smiled at me. The sounds and smells of frying began to fill the air of the apartment as Shinji continued preparing dinner. Hikari and I sat together on the couch for a few minutes, not even really talking. Just enjoying each other's company as good friends sometimes do. We could hear Shinji humming to himself, as he often did while cooking.

她只是对我微笑。随着真嗣继续准备晚餐，煎炸的声音和气味开始弥漫在公寓的空气中。我和光坐在沙发上，几分钟里甚至没有真正交谈。就像好朋友有时那样，我们只是享受着彼此的陪伴。我们能听到真嗣在做饭时经常哼唱的声音。

"He really is a good guy, you know that Asuka."

他真的是个好人，你知道的，明日香。

"Yeah, I know that."

"是的，我知道那个。"

"I know that I've embarrassed you a bit today, but I am really so happy for you guys!"

我知道今天让你有点尴尬，但我真的为你们感到非常高兴！

"Thanks." 谢谢。

Another few moments silence.

又是一阵沉默。

"So… where are you going for your First Date?"

那么……你的第一次约会打算去哪里呢？

"Huh?" I said, confused.

"嗯？" 我困惑地说。

"You know, your first romantic outing as a couple? It has to be somewhere special!"

你知道吗，作为情侣的第一次浪漫出游，地点一定要特别才行！

"In case you missed the last few weeks, Hikari, Shinji is under NERV house arrest. Didn't you see those armed goons standing by the apartment complex's entrance? He's not allowed out for another week and a half!"

如果你错过了最近几周的情况，光，真嗣现在处于 NERV 的软禁之下。你没看到那些武装暴徒守在公寓楼的入口吗？他还有一周半的时间不能外出！

"Oh yeah… I forgot." She remained quiet again for a few seconds. "Unless… "

"哦，对了……我忘了。" 她又沉默了几秒钟。"除非……"

"Unless?" "除非？"

"Hmmm…" She looked thoughtful for a moment. She was about to continue when her cell-phone rang. She answered it.

"嗯……" 她若有所思地停顿了一下。正要继续说时，手机铃声响起，她接起了电话。

"Moshi Moshi! Hello Papa… Yes Papa…. I'm sure it's fine… Yes, I know Papa… Okay, I'll be there soon! Yes Papa I haven't forgotten! Yes Papa… Okay… See you soon! Love you too Papa! Bye."

喂喂！你好爸爸……是的爸爸……我确定没问题……是的，我知道爸爸……好的，我很快就到！是的爸爸我没忘记！是的爸爸……好的……待会儿见！我也爱你爸爸！再见。

"That was my Dad!"

那是我爸爸！

"I never would have guessed."

我绝对猜不到。

"I've gotta go! Kodama's cooking tonight and Dad's worried that she's going to overcook the rice. Papa hates overcooked rice!"

我得走了！今天晚上是 Kodama 做饭，爸爸担心她会把米饭煮过头。爸爸最讨厌煮过头的米饭了！

"Heaven forbid that such a calamity befalls the Horaki household!" I said.

"天哪，千万别让这样的灾难降临到堀北家！" 我说道。

"I know." She replied, missing my sarcasm entirely as she grabbed her bag to leave. "Bye Asuka! Bye Shinji!" She called out as she whizzed past the kitchen.

"我知道了。" 她回答道，完全没有领会到我的讽刺，抓起她的包准备离开。"再见，明日香！再见，真嗣！" 她一边喊着，一边快速经过厨房。

"Uh… bye Hikari!" He called.

"呃… 再见，光！" 他喊道。

I followed her to the front door. "So?"

我跟着她到了前门。“然后呢？”

"Hmm?" she said, distracted as she put her shoes back on.

"嗯？" 她说道，一边心不在焉地重新穿上鞋子。

"What were you going to say before your Father rang?"

在你父亲打电话之前，你想说什么？

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"You said, 'Unless…'?" 你说：“除非……”？

She looked puzzled for a moment. "Oh yes! I have an idea! Can I come around tomorrow morning, about 10 or so? I need to check something with Kodama before I come back."

她一时显得有些困惑。"哦，对了！我有个主意！我明天早上大概 10 点左右能过来吗？我需要先和儿玉确认一些事情再回来。"

"Sure. Tomorrow's not a school day after all. What's the plan?"

当然，毕竟明天不是上学日。有什么计划吗？

"I'll let you know when I see you in the morning!"

"明早见到你时我会告诉你的！"

"Fine then, keep your secrets!"

那好吧，你就守着你的秘密吧！

"Only until tomorrow, I promise!" She said as she stepped through the door. "Bye!"

"只到明天，我保证！" 她边说边穿过门。"再见！"

"Yeah… bye." And she was gone.

"嗯…再见。" 然后她就离开了。

I went back into the kitchen and embraced Shinji from behind as he began to serve up the stir fry that he had been whipping up while Hikari and I had been talking.

我回到厨房，在真嗣开始端出他一边和我们聊天一边炒制的炒菜时，从背后拥抱了他。

"Mmmmmm… Smells good!" I said.

"嗯……闻起来真香！" 我说道。

"Thanks." He replied. "What's going on with Hikari?"

"谢谢。" 他回答道，"光怎么了？"

"I'm not sure… but she's going to come around tomorrow, so I'll guess we'll see then!"

我不太确定……但她明天会来，所以我想到时候我们就知道了！

"Okay… Oh well let's eat!"

好的…哎，那咱们吃饭吧！

"Itadakimasu!" "我要开动了！"

I wasn't too concerned with Hikari's 'plan' for the morning. The girl was naïve and quite sheltered in her outlook. I could not have even begun to imagine what she would turn up with the next day.

我对光早上的所谓“计划”并不太在意。这个女孩天真且相当缺乏世故，我简直无法想象第二天她会带来什么。

"This is so embarrassing!"

这太尴尬了！

"Are you kidding?"I replied. "This is fantastic!" I was enjoying this so much!

"你在开玩笑吗？"我回答道，"这太棒了！"我正享受得不得了！

"That's easy for you to say Asuka!" Shinji whined cutely at me. "You're not dressed like this!"

"你说得倒轻松，明日香！" 真嗣可爱地向我抱怨道，"你又不是穿成这样！"

"Just shut up and drink your milkshake, baka! If you keep talking you'll give the whole game away!"

He just pouted and went back to slurping his jumbo strawberry milkshake up through his straw.

他只是撅了撅嘴，然后继续用吸管大口喝着他的巨型草莓奶昔。

"This was such a great idea Hikari!" I said to my friend. Who was beaming benevolently at us both.

"光，这真是个绝妙的主意！" 我对我的朋友说，他正和蔼可亲地对我们俩微笑着。

"I know!" She replied brightly. "I remembered last night that Kodama still had Mama's old wig... and some old retro dresses that would probably fit Shinji, and with one of Mama's old cardigans over the top of it all, he really does make quite a convincing girl!"

"我知道了！"她兴高采烈地回答，"我昨晚想起小田真还有妈妈的老假发……还有几件复古旧裙子，可能挺适合真嗣的，再套上妈妈的一件旧开衫，他扮成女孩还真挺像的！"

"Thanks." Shinji muttered to himself.

"谢谢。" 碇真嗣自言自语道。

"You think that you've got it bad Third? This is not exactly how I pictured our first date!"

你以为你处境糟糕吗，老三？这可跟我预想中的初次约会大相径庭！

"Me neither." He said sourly.

“我也不。”他酸溜溜地说。

He had not been at all keen when Hikari had turned up that morning at 10am with a duffel bag and a wicked glint in her eye. I still remember how his face turned pale as Hikari had emptied the contents of the bag onto the kitchen table. One black wig, styled into something like a bob-cut, but a little longer. It was a style that was popular with slightly older women about eight years ago or so. One periwinkle blue knee length dress, with pleats in the skirt. One cardigan, of a somewhat darker blue and a pair of black court shoes, obviously from Kodama, as they were too big for Hikari or myself.

那天早上 10 点，当光带着一个帆布包和眼中狡黠的光芒出现时，他一点也不感兴趣。我至今还记得，当光把包里的东西倒在厨房桌上时，他的脸色变得苍白。一顶黑色假发，做成类似波波头但稍长的样式，这种发型大约八年前在稍年长的女性中颇为流行。一件淡紫蓝色的及膝连衣裙，裙摆有褶皱。一件颜色稍深的蓝色开衫和一双黑色高跟鞋，显然来自 Kodama，因为它们对我们俩来说都太大了。

"Oh no... " He had tried to protest. "There is no way in Hell that I am... "

"哦不... " 他试图抗议。 "我绝对不可能... "

So here we were then. The three of us sitting in the food court of Tokyo-3's most popular Shopping Mall. Enjoying, or trying to enjoy in Shinji's case, our milkshakes and keeping our eyes out for Section 2 Goons, or anyone that might recognise us.

于是，我们三人就这样坐在东京第三区最受欢迎的购物中心的美食广场里。享受着，或者说在真嗣的情况下是试图享受着我们的奶昔，同时警惕着第二课的特工，或是任何可能认出我们的人。

So far so good. 到目前为止一切顺利。

"Couldn't you have found him something a bit more current?" I asked Hikari. "I know that you probably didn't have much to work with, but who would believe that I would be seen hanging out with someone who looks like a junior trainee librarian?"

"你就不能给他找点更时髦的东西吗？" 我问光。"我知道你可能没多少可用的，但谁会相信我会和一个看起来像初级实习图书管理员的人混在一起呢？"

Shinji stood up, spilling his milkshake all over the table. "I'm leaving!" He said tautly.

真嗣站起身，不慎将奶昔洒满了桌子。“我要走了！”他紧张地说道。

"Oh, suck it up princess!" I said to him as Hikari mopped up the mess. "Let's ditch this Milkshake stand and do some real shopping!"

"哦，别娇气了，公主！" 我对他这样说，而光正在清理那片狼藉。"咱们别管这个奶昔摊了，去真正逛逛街吧！"

With just a little more whining and some gentle persuasion from Hikari and me, we all headed into the serious end of the mall. The clothing and shoe shops! It was so much fun! Hikari and I both bought new summer dresses and I even managed to get Shinji to try a couple on as well, saying that the store managers would start to get suspicious and start asking him questions if he didn't. The look on his face was so desperate and put upon that I nearly gave up teasing him, but Hikari pushed him even harder than I did, if that was possible.

经过一番稍加抱怨和光与我温柔的劝说，我们一同前往了商场的核心区域——服装和鞋店！那里真是乐趣无穷！光和我都买了新的夏日连衣裙，我甚至设法让真嗣也试了几件，告诉他如果他不试，店经理可能会起疑并开始询问他。他那绝望又无奈的表情让我差点放弃捉弄他，但光比我更狠，如果这还能更狠的话。

I did offer to buy him a pretty blue sun-dress that really set off his eyes beautifully, but the glare that I received told me that maybe I was starting to push him just a little bit too far!

我确实提出要给他买一件漂亮的蓝色太阳裙，那裙子真的能很好地衬托出他的眼睛，但我收到的那个眼神告诉我，或许我开始逼得他有点过头了！

Hikari was a genius! This 'Date' was so much fun, even Shinji was starting to enjoy himself at the end. Even if he did grumble,(Quietly) about having to carry all of the bags for us.

光真是天才！这次“约会”太有趣了，连真嗣到最后也开始享受起来。尽管他确实嘟囔着（小声地）抱怨要为我们拎所有的包。

After a good four hours in the clothing precinct we finally took a break from shopping and hit a juice stand to replenish our energy.

在服装区逛了整整四个小时后，我们终于暂停购物，来到一家果汁摊补充能量。

"Are we finished yet Asuka?" Shinji asked wearily.

"我们还没结束吗，明日香？" 真嗣疲惫地问道。

"Sure Shinji, I think that you've behaved yourself enough to earn the rest of the day off!" I replied magnanimously.

"当然，真嗣，我认为你表现得足够好，可以享受今天剩下的休息时间了！" 我慷慨地回答道。

Hikari looked up from her juice. "If you don't mind I promised Nozomi that I'd see if the new Pokémon Taupe game was out yet, can I just have a quick look in the Game store to check if it's in?"

光从果汁上抬起头来，“如果你不介意的话，我答应了希美要看看新的《宝可梦 Taupe》游戏是否已经上市了，我能快点去游戏店里查看一下吗？”

"Sure." I said. Shinji nodded in agreement. We were both keen to get this whole thing over with and get home.

"当然。" 我说道。真嗣点头表示同意。我们都急切地想结束这一切，然后回家。

We went down the nearest escalator and along the next floor to near where the nearest Game store was located. The usual gaggle of spotty game-dweebs were milling around the front, I paid them no mind. Suddenly Shinji grabbed my arm, hard.

我们沿着最近的自动扶梯下行，并穿过下一层楼，来到离最近的 Game 商店不远处。那里一如既往地聚集着一群满脸青春痘的游戏迷，他们在店前徘徊，我并未理会他们。突然，Shinji 紧紧抓住了我的手臂。

"Ow!" I said in annoyance looking back at him. Then I stopped in my tracks. Shinji's face had gone pale beneath the heavy make-up we had plastered on him. His blue eyes wide in horror.

"哎呀！" 我恼怒地回头看向他，然后停下了脚步。真嗣的脸在厚重的妆容下显得苍白，蓝色的眼睛因恐惧而睁得大大的。

"What is it?" I said in concern.

"这是什么？" 我关切地问道。

"Fucking Kensuke is here!" He whispered fiercely at me.

"该死的健介在这里！" 他恶狠狠地对我低声说道。

"What?" I said spinning around, just in time to nearly collide with that uber-dork Aida as he stood outside of the store chatting with several other bottom feeders.

"什么？"我转身说道，正好差点与那个超级呆子艾达撞个正着，他正站在店外与几个同类闲聊。

"Hey, watch where you're going, Demon!" He had the gall to say to me.

"嘿，看着点路，恶魔！" 他竟敢这样对我说。

"Well, if it isn't the Dork Knight! What's the matter? Your Boyfriend Suzuhara left you to play all on your own today?"

哎呀，这不是黑暗骑士中的呆瓜吗！怎么了？你的男朋友铃原今天丢下你一个人去玩了？

"Get bent Blood-Nut!" The spectacled boy replied, though with a look of real fear in his eyes.

"滚一边去，血头！" 戴眼镜的男孩回答道，尽管他的眼神中透露出真正的恐惧。

"Bring it, four-eyes!" 来吧，四眼仔！

"Hey you two, cut that out!" Hikari intervened. "This is a public area. If you can't be civil then at least just ignore each other. You'll embarrass Shinji!" Hikari's eyes went wide as she realised her mistake.

"喂，你们两个，别闹了！" 光插手了。"这里是公共区域。如果你们不能保持礼貌，至少也别理对方。你们会让真嗣难堪的！" 光意识到自己的错误，眼睛瞪得大大的。

"Why would Shinji be embarrassed? He's not even here." Kensuke asked.

"为什么真嗣会感到尴尬？他甚至不在这里。" 健介问道。

"I-I meant... "Hikari spluttered to cover up. "I meant that it would upset him to see his friends fighting each other like this."

“我、我的意思是……”光结结巴巴地掩饰道，“我是说，看到他的朋友们像这样互相争斗，会让他感到难过。”

"Hmph. Soryu here is no friend to Shinji! She just treats him like a slave! As far as she's concerned he's garbage beneath her feet!"

"哼，这里的 Soryu 可不是 Shinji 的朋友！她只是把他当奴隶对待！在她眼里，他不过是脚下的垃圾！"

"Fuck you Aida!" I said enraged.

"去你的，艾达！" 我愤怒地说道。

"Hey, hey! Cut it out, both of you! Let's just try and act like civilised Human Beings here, okay? Okay?" Hikari said with a hint of Class Representative Authority in her voice.

"嘿，嘿！你们俩都别闹了！我们试着表现得像文明人一样，好吗？好吗？" 光说道，她的声音中带着一丝班长的权威。

"Fine. Just try not to aggravate me."

好吧。尽量别惹我生气。

"Fine by me." Kensuke replied.

"我无所谓。" 健介回答道。

"That's better." Hikari said as an awkward silence settled over us.

"这样好多了。"光说道，尴尬的沉默笼罩了我们。

"So... Erm... Who's your friend?" The Nerd-burger said finally, trying to put on some kind of pathetic 'Mr Smooth' impression for us. I could taste the bile rising in my mouth.

“那么……呃……你的朋友是谁？”书呆子汉堡终于开口了，试图在我们面前装出一副可怜的“潇洒先生”模样。我感到一阵恶心涌上喉头。

"No one you need to worry about, Dweeb!"

“没有你需要担心的人，书呆子！”

"I wasn't addressing you, Demon!"

“我并不是在对你说话，恶魔！”

"Guys... "Said Hikari. “伙计们...”光说道。

"Well, if you really must know," I said. "This is um... Nadia. Nadia des Wasserblaus. She's the daughter of the Scientific Director of NERV Germany. He's over here studying, you know, classified stuff, while I have to play nursemaid for two weeks with this barrel of fun!" I said disparagingly.

“好吧，既然你非要知道，”我说道，“这位是……娜迪亚。娜迪亚·德·瓦瑟布劳克斯。她是 NERV 德国科学总监的女儿。他来这里研究，你知道的，那些机密的东西，而我却得当两周的保姆，陪着这个开心果！”我带着一丝轻蔑地说。

"Asuka! Don't be mean!" Hikari said reproachfully.

"阿苏卡！别这么刻薄！" 光责备地说。

"It's okay, she's so dumb she doesn't even speak any Japanese! Even though her mother came from Fukuoka! Can you believe that?" I said back with an evil grin. "We can say what we like. Nicht ist das recht? Langweiliger Dummkopf?"

"没事，她太笨了，连日语都不会说！尽管她妈妈来自福冈！你能相信吗？" 我带着邪恶的笑容回应道。"我们可以畅所欲言。不是吗？无聊的傻瓜？"

Shinji just kept his head down and wouldn't meet anyone's eyes. Neither he, nor any of the others had a clue what I had said. "Ja..." He replied in a weird falsetto.

新二一直低着头，不愿与任何人对视。他和其他人一样，完全不明白我说了什么。“是啊……”他用一种奇怪的假声回答道。

"See? She says okay!" 看，她说可以！

"Sure... " Aida said, sceptically. "But tell your friend that if she ever needs... um... someone more friendly and hospitable, then I...I'm um... happy to help her out!"

"当然……" 艾达半信半疑地说，"不过告诉你朋友，如果她哪天需要……嗯……一个更友好、更热情的人，那我……我，嗯……很乐意帮她的忙！"

"As if NERV would ever let any of its top staff members children, even one as insignificant as this one, alone with a creep like you Aida!" I replied. I turned to Shinji/Nadia. "Ein Pervert!" I said, motioning contemptuously toward the spectacled boy. Shinji didn't dare look up, I was so enjoying this! "Now beat it, four eyes, before I sic Section 2 onto you for molesting their Pilots!"

“好像 NERV 会让它的任何高级职员的孩子们，哪怕是像这个一样微不足道的，和你这样的变态单独在一起似的！”我回答道。我转向真嗣/娜迪亚，“一个变态！”我说着，轻蔑地指向那个戴眼镜的男孩。真嗣不敢抬头，我正享受着这一刻！“现在滚开，四眼仔，不然我就让第二部门因为你骚扰他们的驾驶员而找你麻烦！”

The boy bowed and scurried off towards the Game store, which kinda counted it out as our next destination.

男孩鞠了一躬，急忙朝游戏商店跑去，这差不多算是我们下一个目的地了。

"Can we please go home now?" Shinji asked plaintively.

"我们现在可以回家了吗？" 真嗣哀求地问道。

"Yeah. I'm all funned out for now." I said. "Hikari, let's get out of here!"

"是啊，我现在玩累了。" 我说，"光，我们离开这里吧！"

"Sure." She replied. "I can check for Nozomi's game another time! Let's go."

"当然可以。" 她回答道，"我可以改天再查看 Nozomi 的游戏！我们走吧。"

So we went back up the escalators, out to the bus stop. Took the bus, the monorail and then the train and then another bus to the stop nearest to our apartment. We walked to the apartment building. The elevator was out of commission again, so we had to climb eight flights of stairs and finally made it back to Misato's apartment.

于是我们返回搭乘扶梯，来到公交站。乘坐公交、单轨列车，再转乘火车，最后换乘另一辆公交到达离我们公寓最近的站点。我们步行至公寓楼。电梯又停运了，无奈之下我们只得爬了八层楼梯，终于回到了美里家。

Shinji's whining about having to carry all of our bags the whole way back really did start to get a bit old after a while though.

真嗣一路上抱怨要扛着我们所有的包，时间一长确实开始有点烦人了。

Hikari had left only a short time after we arrived home from the Mall. Some guff about having to prepare dinner for some aunty or other who was a stickler for dining on time.

我们刚从购物中心回到家不久，光就离开了。说什么要为某个阿姨准备晚餐，那位阿姨对按时用餐非常讲究。

Shinji hit the shower to try and wash off the excess make up and goo that we had prettied him up with for his foray into the Big Wide World. I sat bored on the couch flipping through the cable channels on the TV.

为了洗掉为了他闯荡广阔世界而精心涂抹的浓妆和黏糊糊的东西，真嗣冲进了淋浴间。我无聊地坐在沙发上，翻看着电视上的有线频道。

Bah. Nothing. Why wasn't that Shinji out of the shower yet? Didn't he realise how bored I was? And hungry? He needed to get his ass out here and start cooking me dinner!

唉，什么也没有。为什么新治还没洗完澡？他难道不知道我有多无聊吗？还有多饿？他得赶紧出来给我做饭了！

"Hey Baka!" I called out. "Hurry up and get back out here! I'm starving!"The distant gurgling of the shower draining away was my only answer. Wasn't he finished yet? In impatience I got up from the couch and walked to the door of the bathroom. My hand poised over the door, contemplating whether to knock and disturb his shower. Hmmm... I had a better idea.

"嘿，笨蛋！" 我喊道，"快点出来！我饿坏了！" 远处淋浴间排水声是我唯一的回应。他还没洗完吗？我焦急地从沙发上站起来，走向浴室门。手悬在门上，犹豫着是否要敲门打扰他的淋浴。嗯……我有了个更好的主意。

I walked back to the kitchen, up to the sink, and turned the hot tap on full blast.

我走回厨房，来到水槽前，将热水龙头开到最大。

I smiled an evil smile to myself as I heard the "Waaaaah!" from the apartment's bathroom followed by the sound of a muffled crash and "Ooof!"

当我听到公寓浴室传来“哇啊啊！”的叫声，紧接着是沉闷的撞击声和“哎哟！”的呼喊时，我暗自露出了邪恶的微笑

Quickly trotting back to the bathroom door, I knocked gently on the door. "Shinji?" I asked in my sweetest, most concerned voice. "Are you okay in there?"

我快步跑回浴室门口，轻轻敲了敲门。“真嗣？”我用最甜美、最关切的语气问道，“你在里面还好吗？”

Over the still running shower I heard a plaintive. "Yeah."

在淋浴还在流水的时候，我听到了一声哀怨的回应：“嗯。”

I opened the door and was unable to stop myself from chuckling at the sight I saw before me.

我打开门，看到眼前的景象，忍不住笑出声来。

"Geez, Shinji!" I said, reaching over and turning off the shower. "What are you doing lying there sticking your scrawny ass up at me like that?"

"哎呀，真嗣！" 我说着，伸手过去关掉了淋浴。"你躺在那儿，把那瘦弱的屁股翘得那么高对着我，这是在干嘛呢？"

He turned over and struggled up into a sitting position. Not for the first time I had to admire how all of the physical training and combat drills had hardened his lean physique. Sure he was still kinda skinny, but there wasn't an ounce of excess fat on him. Hmmm... Control yourself Soryu.

他翻身挣扎着坐了起来。这已不是我第一次赞叹，所有的体能训练和战斗演练是如何将他那精瘦的身躯锤炼得如此坚韧。尽管他依旧有些瘦削，但身上没有一丝赘肉。嗯……要控制住自己，Soryu。

He didn't bother trying to cover up his nakedness, let's say that we were beyond that level of modesty between us. He held his hand up to his forehead. "Thanks a lot Asuka!" He whined. "What did you do that for?"

他并没有费心去遮掩自己的裸露，可以说我们之间已经超越了那种程度的羞涩。他举起手放在额头上，“真是谢谢你了，明日香！”他抱怨道，“你为什么要那么做？”

I got down on my hands and knees and brought myself close to him, our faces mere centimetres apart.

我跪下双手撑地，让自己靠近他，我们的脸相距仅几厘米。

"Whatever do you mean Shinji?" I asked innocently, putting on my biggest and most appealing eyes for him.

"你到底是什么意思，真嗣？" 我天真地问道，对他眨巴着最大最迷人的眼睛。

"Hahahaha...Ow!" He said, rubbing his forehead gently. "You know very well! You put the hot tap on in the kitchen so that the shower would go cold, didn't you?"

"哈哈哈哈...哎哟！" 他边说边轻轻揉着额头，"你心里清楚得很！你在厨房开了热水龙头，让淋浴变冷了，对吧？"

I tried to look hurt by his accusation, but the smile I felt was beginning to win through my innocent facade. "Mmm... Maybe..."

我试图装出被他的指责伤害的样子，但内心涌起的笑意正逐渐穿透我无辜的伪装。“嗯……也许吧……”

He reached up, pulled the towel off the rail and began to dry his hair. "Ow!" He said as he dried around the right side of his forehead. I pulled the towel out of his grip and pushed the wet hair out of the way with my hand. There was quite a red mark just below his hairline, a small pang of guilt did trouble me for a moment. I bent forward and kissed the mark gently.

他伸手取下毛巾架上的毛巾，开始擦干头发。"哎哟！"他在擦额头右侧时叫了一声。我抽出他手中的毛巾，用手拨开湿漉漉的头发。发际线下方有一块相当红的痕迹，一丝愧疚感瞬间困扰了我。我俯身向前，轻轻地吻了吻那块痕迹。

"Ummm... Sorry Shinji." "呃... 对不起，真嗣。"

He smiled at that. "That's okay Asuka."

他对此笑了笑。“没关系，明日香。”

We stared at each other for several more moments.

我们又相互凝视了片刻。

"Shinji..." I said, leaning my body forward so that I was now pressed up against him.

"真嗣..." 我说着，身体前倾，紧紧贴在了他身上。

"Yeah?" He replied with a gulp.

"是吗？" 他回答时咽了口口水。

"I'm bored!" I said, giving him a small kiss on the lips.

"我好无聊！" 我说着，轻轻在他唇上吻了一下。

"Uh-huh." "嗯哼。"

"Whatchya gonna do about it?" I purred in what I considered to be my most seductive voice.

"你打算怎么办呢？" 我用自认为最迷人的声音柔声说道。

"Um... A couple of rounds of Euchre perhaps?"

呃...或许来几局尤克牌？

"Baka!" I said, giving him a not so gentle cuff to the back of the head. "Think of something else!"

"笨蛋！" 我喊道，给了他一个不怎么温柔的后脑勺一巴掌。"想点别的吧！"

"Ummm..." He continued as I pressed myself even more firmly against him. I could feel the reaction that I had been waiting for.

"嗯……" 他继续说着，而我更加用力地贴紧了他。我能感觉到那期待已久的反应。

"I think that at least part of you has an idea..." I said, kissing him. Even then he still blushed. He really was adorable sometimes.

“我想至少有一部分的你已经有所察觉……”我边说边吻他。即便那时，他依旧脸红了。他有时候真的很可爱。

"Ah... Maybe..." he said.

“啊……或许吧……”他说道。

"You know, it might sound strange, but you made a really cute girl, does that make me weird?"

你知道，这可能听起来很奇怪，但你创造了一个非常可爱的女孩，这会让我显得很奇怪吗？

"Um... Maybe?" 呃... 可能吧？

"Maybe..." I repeated. "But I know that you love me for it!"

"或许吧……" 我重复道，"但我知道，你因此而爱我！"

He smiled that smile at me. It was so adorable that it pushed me right over the edge.

他对我露出了那样的微笑，如此可爱，让我彻底沦陷。

I leaned back and pulled off my top and wriggled out of the cut-off shorts I was wearing, exposing my bare body to the humid bathroom air. Then I leaned forward again to kiss him deeply. He responded back in kind as our tongues intertwined together. I could feel his strong hand on my breast, teasing and pinching the nipple between his thumb and forefinger. Oh God, I really wanted to feel him inside me so bad at that moment.

我向后仰身，脱掉上衣，扭动着从那条剪短的短裤中挣脱出来，将赤裸的身体暴露在潮湿的浴室空气中。随后，我又向前倾身，深情地吻向他。他同样热烈地回应着我，我们的舌头交缠在一起。我能感觉到他有力的手抚摸着我的乳房，用拇指和食指轻捏着乳头，挑逗着。哦，天哪，那一刻我多么渴望他深入我的身体。

"L-Let's go to the bedroom, now!" I breathed urgently.

"现在，我们去卧室吧！" 我急切地说道。

"Okay." He answered as we both struggled to our feet on the slippery bathroom tiles.

"好的。" 我们俩在滑溜溜的浴室瓷砖上挣扎着站起来时，他回答道。

Let's just say that I didn't get my dinner for quite some time after that!

这么说吧，那之后我好一阵子都没吃上晚饭！

Misato came home again that night. Late, but still she came home.

那天夜里，Misato 又回家了。虽然晚了些，但她还是回来了。

Blast! That meant that I had to sleep in my own bed, Alone! What a crock!

糟糕！这意味着我得独自睡在自己的床上！真是荒谬！

She had a shower while Shinji warmed up some left over curry for her to eat. I just sat on the couch cursing the luck that brought our guardian home to ruin my night of Shinji related fun and nursing a mug of hot cocoa that Shinji had made for me.

她洗澡的时候，真嗣为她热了些剩下的咖喱。我则坐在沙发上，咒骂着把我们的监护人带回家来毁掉我与真嗣欢乐之夜的霉运，手里捧着真嗣为我做的热可可。

At least the stuff in the bathroom, and afterwards, had been fun. And by fun I mean awesome. But I had hoped for so much more. That was at least until Misato had turned up.

至少浴室里的那些玩意儿，还有之后的事，确实挺有趣的。我说的有趣，是指棒极了。但我本期望有更多惊喜。至少在葛城出现之前，我是这么想的。

Hmph.. Killjoy 哼.. 扫兴鬼

The aforementioned Killjoy finally came out of the bathroom dressed in her dressing gown and slippers and rubbing her hair with a towel, a bundle of clothes in her hand. My eyes widened as I recognised them as the clothes that Shinji and I had discarded during our earlier activities.

上述的 Killjoy 终于从浴室出来了，穿着浴袍和拖鞋，手里拿着一捆衣服，用毛巾擦着头发。我瞪大了眼睛，认出那些正是真嗣和我之前活动时丢弃的衣服。

"I hate to sound like a nag here." She said. "But could you guys not just leave your dirty clothes lying on the bathroom floor? At least Put them in the hamper when you've finished with them!"

"我真不想在这里唠叨。" 她说，"但你们能不能别把脏衣服扔在浴室地板上？至少用完后放进洗衣篮里吧！"

"Yes Misato!" Shinji said.

"好的，美里！" 真嗣说道。

"Why should I?" I exclaimed, getting into character. "That's what we've got Shinji here for!"

“我为什么要这么做？”我入戏地喊道，“这不正是我们让真嗣在这里的原因吗！”

"No, Asuka! It's not his job to pick up your dirty underwear for you!"

不，明日香！捡起你的脏内衣不是他的责任！

"Yeah, well who knows what the Hentai would do if he got his grimy mitts on my precious underwear anyway. He probably sells them to his perverted friends!"

是啊，谁知道那个变态要是拿到我珍贵的内衣会干出什么来。他很可能把它们卖给他的那些猥琐朋友！

"A-Asuka!" Shinji stammered, also getting into his character beautifully, "I d-do not sell..."

"飞鸟前辈！" 真嗣结巴着，也完美地进入了角色，"我、我不卖的……"

"Just stick a sock in it, both of you! This is my first night away from work in over a week. I just want to enjoy it in peace!"

你们俩都别说了！这是我一周多以来第一个不工作的夜晚，我只想安静地享受它！

"Sorry Misato." Shinji said.

"对不起，美里。" 真嗣说道。

I said nothing. But when Misato wasn't looking I did give Shinji a conspiratorial wink over my hot cocoa. He gave me a quick smile back.

我什么也没说。但当碇真嗣不注意时，我确实在喝热可可的时候向他眨了眨眼，传递了一种默契。他迅速回了我一个微笑。

Misato was too busy swigging beer and manhandling the penguin to even notice.

碇真嗣太忙于痛饮啤酒和粗暴对待那只企鹅，以至于根本没有注意到。

We all turned in for an early night. There wasn't much point staying up anyway.

我们都早早地睡了。反正熬夜也没多大意义。

I slept like a sack of crap that night. My own bed sucked. It was so cold and empty all by myself. I had gotten too used to sharing the space with my Shinji to keep me warm. I just couldn't get off to sleep on my own.

那晚我睡得像一袋垃圾。我自己的床糟透了。独自一人，感觉又冷又空。我已经太习惯和我的 Shinji 共享空间来取暖了。我一个人就是睡不着。

To add insult to injury, just as I was finally drifting off... Misato's fucking phone rang! Arrgh! I lay there waiting for her to pick it up. Nothing. That Woman could sleep through God-Damned doomsday!

更让人恼火的是，就在我终于要睡着的时候……真嗣他妈的电话响了！啊！我躺在那里等她接电话。什么动静也没有。那个女人能在世界末日中安然入睡！

I threw the covers back angrily and got out of bed. I went out to the kitchen where the offending cell-phone lay ringing on the bench top. I picked it up, walked to the door of Misato's room. Took aim and threw it at the lumpen shape of NERV's Director of Operations. I was quietly pleased at the "Oomph!" That I heard as the phone struck her sleeping form.

我气愤地掀开被子，下了床。走到厨房，那部惹事的手机正躺在台面上响个不停。我拿起它，走到美里房间的门口，对准 NERV 运营总监那团隆起的身影，用力扔了过去。当手机击中她熟睡的身体时，我听到一声“呃！”，心中暗自得意。

The phone disappeared beneath the quilt.

手机消失在被褥之下。

"Hello?" I heard her muffled voice say. "Yes... Yes Sir! We'll be there right away sir! Yes. Goodbye."

"喂？" 我听到她含糊的声音说道，"是的... 是的，先生！我们马上就到，先生！好的，再见。"

Misato's head appeared from beneath the bed covers and she looked at me blearily.

碇真嗣的视线中，明日香从被窝里探出头来，睡眼惺忪地望着他。

"Asuka?" She said. "Asuka?" 她说道。

"Yeah?"I answered. Please don't say Angel Alarm, Please don't say Angel Alarm, Please don't say Angel Alarm!

"嗯？"我回答道。千万别说天使警报，千万别说天使警报，千万别说天使警报！

"There's an Angel Alarm."

有一个天使警报。

Shit! "Good!" I lied. "Another chance to show how great I am."

该死！"好极了！"我撒谎道，"又一个展示我有多出色的机会。"

"That my girl." 那是我的女孩。

"I'll wake up sleeping Baka!"

我要唤醒沉睡的笨蛋！

"Thanks... We need to get going in the next 5 minutes, this sounds like a big one."

谢谢...我们得在接下来的五分钟内出发，听起来这是个大事。

"You know what they say, the Bigger they are... something something..."

你知道他们怎么说，越大……怎么说来着……

"That's the spirit." She said with a tired smile.

"这就对了。" 她带着疲惫的微笑说道。

I left her to get dressed while I woke up Shinji.

我让她去穿衣服，同时我叫醒了真嗣。

I was more than a little annoyed. Those Angels had no sense of decency, getting us up out of bed like this.

我感到相当恼火。那些天使们真不懂礼貌，就这样把我们叫醒。

That Angel was gonna pay for this.

那个天使会为此付出代价的。

I hoped. 我曾抱有希望。

"No steak dinner is worth this!" I said loudly, my frustration rising at the waiting that I was having to endure.

"没有一顿牛排晚餐值得这样等待！"我大声说道，对不得不忍受的等待感到越来越沮丧。

Through the open Com Window I saw Shinji smile at my outburst. He, like me, knew it was never about the steak to begin with. I wasn't even that big a fan of scorched, over-priced cow-parts anyway. Though I knew that, especially with many older Japanese like Misato, steak was considered something of a prestige item.

透过敞开的通讯窗口，我看到真嗣对我突然的情绪爆发报以微笑。他和我一样，明白这从来都不是关于牛排本身。我本来就不太喜欢那些烧焦的、价格过高的牛排。尽管我知道，尤其是对于像美里这样的许多年长的日本人来说，牛排被视为一种身份的象征。

Yes, I know that the intention was generous. A way to show her appreciation for what we were doing. It was certainly a lot more than the big fat 'Nothing' that NERV usually offered as a reward for risking your skin in its service.

是的，我知道这份心意是慷慨的。一种表达她对我们所做事情感激之情的方式。这无疑比 NERV 通常作为对冒着生命危险为其服务的奖励——那丰厚的“无”——要来得更多。

But still, sitting around waiting for an organic killing machine the size of a small Pacific Atoll to fall from the upper Stratosphere, land somewhere within a fourteen kilometre radius and go off like the Tsar Bomba wasn't exactly conducive to a calm and contemplative outlook on life. Especially when the Grand Plan required for you to Goddamn well catch it!

然而，坐在那里等待一个大小堪比小型太平洋环礁的有机杀戮机器从平流层高空坠落，在十四公里范围内着陆并像沙皇炸弹一样爆炸，这绝非有助于保持冷静和沉思的生活态度。尤其是当宏伟计划要求你他妈的必须捕捉到它时！

With all of that I was supposed to get excited about a freaking steak dinner?

就这些，我还要为一顿该死的牛排晚餐兴奋不已？

Whoop-de-fucking-do. 真是太棒了。

Misato's face popped up in a communications window. "Keep alert everyone! Once the target's trajectory is established the Magi will feed you the co-ordinates and ETA direct into your onboard computers."

通讯窗口中突然出现了美里小姐的面孔：“大家保持警觉！一旦确定了目标的轨迹，MAGI 系统会直接将坐标和预计到达时间传送到你们的机载电脑上。”

"Hai, hai." I said as the com window flipped off.

"嗨，嗨。" 我说道，随着通讯窗口的关闭。

I looked up at the clear sky above my Evangelion. The targeting reticule briefly wavered over a distant skein of birds and then on a plastic bag wafting around in eddies of rising warm air. Then it flickered off. Nothing, nicht, nada, nul, niente, zero, zilch, zip, bubkiss. No sign that Giant Explody Alien Death From Above was lurking up there in the azure firmament.

我抬头望向我的福音战士上方的晴朗天空。瞄准准星短暂地在远处一群鸟儿上方摇摆，随后又移向一个在上升暖流漩涡中飘荡的塑料袋。接着，它闪烁着消失了。什么都没有，无，零，空，无物，零点，一无所有，绝无，空空如也。在那蔚蓝的天穹之上，没有任何迹象表明有巨型爆炸外星死亡威胁潜伏其中。

Bah... The waiting game sucks.

唉...等待的游戏真糟糕。

I flipped open a com channel. "Hey Shinji!"

我打开了通信频道，“嘿，真嗣！”

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"I'm bored!" 我好无聊！

"Bored?" Misato interrupted, her irate face appearing in a window in front of me. "How can you be bored Asuka? A Goddamned Angel is about to drop on us all from suborbital space and you're bored?"

"无聊了？" 葛城打断道，她那愤怒的脸庞出现在我面前的一个窗口中。"你怎么可能无聊呢，明日香？一个该死的使徒正要从亚轨道空间向我们所有人砸下来，你居然觉得无聊？"

"Geez Misato! Get outta my face already! I wasn't even talking to you!"

哎呀，美里！别再烦我了！我根本就没跟你说话！

"Suck it up Asuka, and Focus! I don't need to remind you what's at stake here!" Her face disappeared from my HUD as quickly as it had come. Shinji's face, however, was still in front of me as his com channel was still open. I could see him wearing a particularly irritating smirk.

振作起来，明日香，集中精神！我不需要提醒你这里牵涉到什么！" 她的脸迅速从我的 HUD 上消失，就像它突然出现一样。然而，真嗣的脸仍然在我面前，因为他的通讯频道仍然开着。我可以看到他带着一种特别让人恼火的坏笑。

"Shut up Third!" "闭嘴，老三！"

"I didn't say anything!"

"我什么也没说！"

"You don't have to. Just wipe that smirk off your face or I'll have Unit 02 do it for you!"

你不必这样。赶紧把你脸上的坏笑擦掉，不然我就让二号机来帮你擦！

His eyes widened a little before he smiled a much more appealing smile at me and bowed his head. "As you wish..." And with that his channel was closed too. Once again I was alone and bored. The sky remained tauntingly empty and blue. I closed my eyes. I ran through the diagnostics checklist again and repeated the locations of armament buildings and Eva lift points over to myself. It was my foolproof way to regain my focus and composure. I could feel my heart rate slowing and my mind becoming clear of extraneous thought.

他的眼睛微微睁大，随即对我露出了一个更加迷人的微笑，并低下了头。“如您所愿……”随着这句话，他的频道也关闭了。我又一次孤身一人，感到无聊。天空依旧空荡荡的，蓝得让人心烦。我闭上眼睛，再次浏览诊断清单，反复默念武器库位置和 Eva 升降点。这是我恢复专注和镇定的万全之策。我能感觉到心跳放缓，思绪也变得清晰，不再有杂念。

I opened my eyes again. "Ikuhayo Asuka." I said to myself. It had been my mantra for longer than I could remember.

我再次睁开双眼。“飞向明日香。”我自言自语道。这句咒语我已经念了多久，连我自己都记不清了。

Alright, Angel. I'm ready for you.

好了，天使，我准备好了。

Despite my determination, the sky remained tauntingly empty of Angel.

尽管我决心坚定，天空依旧空荡荡的，不见天使的踪影。

Time dragged on as we waited. Now there were no birds, no sounds of man or nature, not even any debris floating on the light breeze. Just the soft hum of the LCL filters located at the rear of the entry plug and the blue sky above. My eyes were starting to get those weird floaty spots that you sometimes see when you're staring at nothingness for too long. They were really beginning to bug me. Everyone was on edge and the waiting around was beginning to wear everyone ragged. Even Misato's periodic exhortations to pay attention and be prepared to engage were beginning to sound forced.

时间在我们等待中缓缓流逝。此刻，四周没有鸟鸣，没有人类或自然的声响，甚至连微风中飘浮的碎片也不见踪影。唯有插入栓后方 LCL 过滤器发出的轻柔嗡鸣，以及头顶那片蔚蓝的天空。我的眼睛开始出现那种长时间凝视虚无时偶尔会看到的奇怪漂浮斑点，它们着实让我心烦。每个人都紧张不安，漫长的等待开始让所有人疲惫不堪。就连美里时不时提醒大家保持警觉、准备投入战斗的激励话语，也逐渐显得有些勉强。

Still time dragged on.

时间依旧缓慢流逝。

I flipped open the general com channel. "Still bored." I said.

我打开了通用通讯频道，说道：“还是无聊。”

Misato was less than impressed.

美里并不怎么感冒。

"Asuka! Keep the channels clear for... "

"明日香！保持通道畅通，以便……"

She got no further before the alarm sounded and the status bar on my HUD changed to red. I looked up. The targeting reticule was now fixed on one section of the sky. At its centre was a miniscule black dot, dragging a thin condensation trail behind it. It was growing larger and larger by the second.

她还没来得及继续，警报就响了起来，我抬头显示器上的状态栏变成了红色。我抬头一看，瞄准准星现在固定在天空的一片区域上。在其中心，有一个微小的黑点，拖着一条细长的凝结尾迹。它正以肉眼可见的速度迅速变大。

"Angel inbound!" One of the bridge techs exclaimed. Probably the glasses one that was not so secretly nursing a semi for Misato. "Impact estimated in 89 seconds!"

"天使来袭！"舰桥上的一名技术人员惊呼道。可能是那位戴眼镜的，他暗地里对美里抱有一丝半点的情愫。"预计撞击时间 89 秒！"

"The MAGI have calculated impact zone with a probability of 96.2 percent! Co-ordinates Z Plural ZZ Alpha!" I think that was Lt Ibuki speaking this time. I'm not too sure. I've got a terrible memory for peons. "Uploading data to the Evangelions!"

MAGI 已计算出 96.2%概率的撞击区域！坐标 Z 复数 ZZ 阿尔法！这次说话的应该是伊吹摩耶上尉，我不太确定，我对小人物的记忆很糟糕。“正在向福音战士上传数据！”

Suddenly, on the HUD, a small hill on the northern side of the City was highlighted in green. That was it. That was where the Angel would impact. That was the point where I may die. I shook my head. That was where I would defeat this Angel.

突然，在抬头显示器上，城市北侧的一座小山丘被绿色高亮显示。就是那里。那就是使徒将要撞击的地方。那是我可能丧命的地点。我摇了摇头。那正是我将击败这个使徒的地方。

"Evas! Move out!" Misato yelled.

"伊娃们！出发！" 美里大声喊道。

And it was on. 然后就开始了。

Jettisoning the power cable with a thought I then willed Unit 02 forward. This was the first time outside of simulations that I had pushed the Evangelion this hard. The giant bio-mechanical beast quickly achieved speeds approaching the sub-sonic. I could feel the impact of each footfall transmitted up the Eva's enormous legs before pushing off again with tremendous force. Roads crumbled beneath my feet and tall metal towers whizzed by as I thundered towards the hill as fast as I was able. The Evangelions only had 5 minutes operative power, but that was currently the furthest thing from my mind. If we hadn't stopped the Angel by the time we ran out of power, it would be because we were already dead.

我意念一动，便抛开了电源线，随后驱使着零号机向前冲刺。这是我首次在模拟训练之外，如此全力以赴地操控着这台巨型生化机械兽。它迅速加速，逼近亚音速。我能感受到每一次踏地带来的冲击，沿着零号机庞大的腿部传递上来，紧接着又以惊人的力量再次蹬地。脚下的道路在我踩踏下崩裂，高耸的金属塔楼在我疾驰中一闪而过，我以所能达到的最快速度向着山丘轰鸣而去。虽然零号机的作战时间仅有五分钟，但此刻这已是我心中最遥远的事情。如果我们耗尽电力时还未阻止使徒，那只能是因为我们已不复存在。

I was leaping lines of high voltage like they were hurdles on an athletics track as I approached the small hill that was my target. I could just make out in my peripheral vision the large plumes of dust thrown up by the other two Evangelions as they zeroed in on the same point that I was racing to.

我如同在田径赛道上跨越栏架一般，跃过一道道高压线，朝着目标的小山丘逼近。在视野的边缘，我能隐约看见另外两台福音战士激起的巨大尘土云，它们正与我竞速，目标直指同一地点。

I've always been left with an almost movie like sense of clarity in the memories that I have of all of the battles that I fought in during the Angel Wars. I can still see every detail like it was playing out before me right now. The enormous dust clouds converging on the hill and the Angel, unbelievably huge now as it neared the Earth, spreading itself out like an enormous mutant starfish, or something. Small eddies spiralled off the outstretched limbs as it plummeted into the warmer, denser air at the lower Troposphere.

在天使战争中我所经历的每一场战斗，留给我的记忆总是如同电影般清晰。那些细节至今仍历历在目，仿佛此刻正在我眼前上演。巨大的尘埃云汇聚在山丘上，天使随着接近地球而变得不可思议地庞大，它展开身躯，犹如一只巨大的变异海星，或是某种存在。当它坠入低层对流层中更温暖、更稠密的空气中时，从伸展的肢体上旋出了小小的涡流。

We were supposed to catch that? Misato needed her fucking head read if she thought that was even possible!

我们本应该抓住那个？如果碇真嗣认为那还有可能，她真该去检查一下脑子了！

And I had another news flash for her. We weren't going to make it. From my perspective the Angel now looked almost as if it were touching the hill, and by my estimation I was about 15 seconds away from ground zero. Even as I pushed my Unit 02 on the realisation struck me that we were probably going to die. There was no way I could get there in time to catch it!

我还有另一个消息要告诉她。我们来不及了。从我的角度看，那使徒现在几乎像是触碰到了山丘，我估计自己距离地面零点大约还有 15 秒。即便我全力推动二号机，我意识到我们可能真的会死。我根本不可能及时赶到那里去接住它！

The dust plume to my right suddenly grew larger and I could now make out the seemingly small purple figure of Unit 01 at its head becoming a virtual blur as Shinji found something extra from the Prototype.

我右边的尘埃云突然变大，现在我能辨认出位于其前端的 01 号机那看似微小的紫色身影，随着真嗣从原型机中发掘出额外的东西，它几乎变成了一片模糊。

Several seconds later I felt rather than heard the sonic boom as Unit 01 briefly broke the sound barrier before disappearing around the other side of the hill as I neared its base.

几秒钟后，我与其说是听到，不如说是感受到了零号机在短暂突破音障时产生的音爆，随后它便消失在了山丘的另一侧，而我正接近其基地。

Oh shit, I thought. Now the Angels arms seemed to almost stretch from horizon to horizon. It seemed that it was just about to impact as I finally reached the base. I braced for the end even as I began to climb.

我心想，糟了。现在天使的手臂仿佛从地平线延伸到地平线。就在我终于抵达基地时，它似乎即将撞击。即使我开始攀爬，我也做好了迎接终结的准备。

Suddenly the sky grew black and the Angel appeared to hang in the air. What the?

突然间，天空变得漆黑，天使仿佛悬挂在空中。这是怎么回事？

Then I saw it. The Angel was being held up by a large orange hexagon. One of the others had beaten me to the impact point. I could feel the old ire rising in me. I would not be shown up here! That was quickly swept away by the almost inhuman screaming coming from Shinji in Unit 01.

接着我看到了，天使被一个巨大的橙色六边形支撑着。其中一人已经抢先我一步到达了撞击点。我感到旧时的怒火在心中升腾。我绝不能在这里被比下去！但很快，这股情绪被来自初号机中真嗣那近乎非人的尖叫声一扫而空。

Shinji was up there alone, with the whole weight of the Angel on his Evangelion. I willed my machine up the hill to my lover's aid. Then the A-T field holding back the Angel became brighter and it appeared to push it back just a little.

真嗣独自一人在那里，承受着天使全部的重量压在他的福音战士上。我驱使我的机器爬上山坡，去援助我的爱人。随后，阻挡天使的 A-T 力场变得更加明亮，似乎稍稍将其推回了一些。

Fuck! That meant Ayanami was there now!Despite this Shinji's agonised screaming continued on unabated.

该死！这意味着绫波现在就在那里！尽管如此，真嗣痛苦的尖叫声依旧没有减弱。

"Pilot Soryu! Quickly!" “Soryu 飞行员！快点！”

"Don't you fucking dare tell me what to do, First!" I snarled as I crested the hill.

“你他妈的敢告诉我该做什么，第一！”我爬上山丘时咆哮道。

Now I could see the reason for Shinji's cries. Unit 01 was directly beneath the Angel, arms raised to support the A-T Field that it has raised to fend off the Angel and prevent its impact with the Earth. How he had been able to support something as enormous as that alone was beyond me. But the true horror was that the Angel had managed to pierce his A-T Field with two viciously spiralled spikes that had entered the base of Unit 01's hands and then exited through the bottom of its elbows before boring into the Earth beneath it.

现在我明白了真嗣为何会发出那样的呼喊。零号机正位于使徒正下方，双臂高举以支撑其张开的 A-T 力场，以此抵御使徒并阻止其撞击地球。他如何能独自支撑如此庞大的存在，我难以理解。但真正的恐怖在于，使徒竟用两根螺旋状尖刺穿透了 A-T 力场，这些尖刺从零号机手背根部刺入，再从肘部下方穿出，最终钻入其下方的地面。

The agony that it inflicted must have been indescribable.

它所带来的痛苦必定是无法形容的。

Unit 00 was there, adding its A-T Field to Unit 01's to take some of the weight off of Shinji. As I approached in Unit 02 I saw Unit 00 deploy its progressive knife and use it to tear a long slit in the field above it, exposing the bright red sphere of the Angel's core.

零号机也在那里，它施展 A-T 力场与初号机叠加，为真嗣减轻了负担。当我驾驶二号机靠近时，目睹了零号机拔出其高振动粒子刀，在头顶的力场上划开一道长长的裂口，露出了天使核心那耀眼的红球。

"Pilot Soryu!" The First called out again. That bossy bitch.

"堀江龙子！" 一佐再次呼喊道。那个专横的泼妇。

"I'm on it!" I yelled in reply.

"我这就去办！" 我大声回应道。

I willed my own Progressive knife to deploy, and trying not to think of the pained cries of my Shinji I drove it up and into the slit. The core was hard as steel and I could feel the extra pressure the Angel exerted to attempt to block my strike and also close up the rent in its armour. I willed my own A-T field up and out to hold the slit open and I could sense the other two Evangelions putting everything they could into the effort to hold the Angel back and buy me the time I needed.

我催动自己的进步，使刀刃展开，尽量不去想真嗣痛苦的呼喊，将刀刺入裂缝。核心坚硬如钢，我能感受到使徒为了阻挡我的攻击并试图封闭装甲裂口所施加的额外压力。我释放自己的 A-T 力场，撑开裂缝，同时能感知到另外两台福音战士正倾尽全力牵制使徒，为我争取所需的时间。

I drove the knife against the core with every fibre of my being. Sparks flew from the sphere as the knife's sonic energy pushed against it. I could hear someone screaming. "Die! Die! Die!" it took me a moment to realise that it was actually me.

我用尽全力将刀刺向核心，刀刃的声波能量与球体相撞，火花四溅。我听到有人在尖叫：“死吧！死吧！死吧！”过了一会儿，我才意识到那尖叫声竟是来自我自己。

Then the Angel began to let out a high pitched wailing that I almost felt more than I heard. My whole focus was on the knife attempting to pierce the crimson sphere. My own arms were burning with the exertion of sustaining the attack and I could hear Shinji's cries taking on a more desperate pitch. This was taking too long!

随后，天使开始发出尖锐的哀鸣，那声音我几乎是用感觉而非听觉捕捉到的。我的全部注意力都集中在试图刺穿那血红球体的刀刃上。我自己的双臂因持续攻击而感到灼热，同时也能听到真嗣的呼喊声变得越发绝望。这过程太漫长了！

Finally, the surface of the core began to yield. Small cracks appeared on its previously flawless surface. These rapidly became larger cracks as the high pitched wailing reached a crescendo that felt like it was scraping against the inside of my skull.

最终，核心表面开始屈服。原本无瑕的表面上出现了细小的裂纹。随着那尖锐的哀鸣声达到高潮，仿佛在我头骨内刮擦，这些裂纹迅速扩大成更大的裂缝。

Then, the sweetest feeling as the prog knife broke through the outer shell of the core and sunk deeply, almost to the hilt, into it. Everything seemed to stop for a second. For that small moment there was no noise, no movement, nothing but the core of the Angel as its light was extinguished and thick dark blood began to pour from the wound that I had made.

随后，当程序刀穿透核心的外壳，深深刺入其中，几乎触及刀柄时，一种最甜美的感觉油然而生。一切仿佛在那一刻静止了。在那短暂瞬间，没有声响，没有动作，只有天使核心的光芒熄灭，浓稠的暗血从我造成的伤口中涌出。

I knew what would happen next. I extended my A-T Field outward as the Angel's core collapsed and went into critical failure and the World turned white.

我知道接下来会发生什么。当天使的核心崩溃并陷入致命故障时，我向外扩展了我的 A-T 场，世界随即变得一片雪白。

"Asuka? Asuka answer me!"

明日香？明日香，回答我！

I shook my head to try to regain my senses as the dust and debris cleared. I guess that I must have been stunned by the force of the blast when the Angel went critical. I could taste blood in my mouth and I felt as if I had been kicked in the chest by a mule.

尘埃与碎片散去之际，我摇头试图恢复清醒。想必是天使失控爆炸的冲击力让我一时晕眩。我口中尝到了血的味道，感觉像是被骡子猛踢了胸口一般。

"Roger Misato! I'm okay." I sputtered.

"罗杰·三佐！我没事。" 我喘着气说。

"Thank God! Asuka, I can't contact Shinji! Our sensors show that Unit 01 is 560 metres south-west from your current position. Can you see him from where you are?"

谢天谢地！明日香，我联系不上真嗣！我们的传感器显示，初号机在你当前位置西南方向 560 米处。你从那里能看到他吗？

I looked around me. All I could see was the gore spattered interior of the crater that the exploding Angel had left behind it. Unit 02, with me still in it, was sprawled on the bottom, the Progressive knife still clutched in its hand. I returned it to its place in the right pauldron and gave my Eva the once over. It was dusty and dirty, with some bloody Angel remnants daubed here and there, but otherwise unharmed. I had deployed my A-T Field just in time it seemed. I couldn't see any sign of the other two Units though.

我环顾四周，眼前只有那爆炸天使留下的弹坑内部，血迹斑斑。零号机二号机，我仍在其中，瘫倒在坑底，手中的进步刀仍紧握不放。我将刀放回右肩甲的固定位置，仔细检查了我的 EVA。它满是尘土和污垢，四处沾染着天使的血迹残余，但除此之外并无损伤。看来我及时展开的 A-T 力场起到了作用。然而，其他两台机体的踪迹却不见分毫。

"Negative, Misato." "否定，碇。"

According to the display, Unit 02 still had just under two minutes of active battery life left. There was no time to waste then. Forcing my Eva into action I willed Unit 02 to its feet and clambered out of the crater. Just past the edge I could see Unit 00. The Blue Evangelion was crouched in shutdown mode. It had sustained quite a bit more damage than my Unit 02 and its armour was scorched black in several places. The Entry Plug was partially ejected and I could see Ayanami already was outside the plug and climbing her way down to the ground. She waved at Unit 02 as I went past to show that she was okay. I paid her no mind. I had more important things to look for.

根据显示屏，二号机剩余的活跃电池寿命不足两分钟。那时没有时间可以浪费了。我迫使我的 Eva 行动起来，让二号机站起身，从弹坑中爬出。刚过边缘，我就能看到零号机。蓝色的福音战士处于关闭模式，蹲伏着。它遭受的损伤比我的二号机严重得多，装甲在几处被烧得焦黑。插入栓部分弹出，我看到绫波已经离开了插入栓，正往地面爬去。当我经过时，她向二号机挥手示意她没事。我没有理会她。我有更重要的事情要寻找。

"Shinji! Come on!" I muttered to myself. "Where the fuck are you?"

"真嗣！快点！"我自言自语道，"你他妈在哪儿？"

The Earth around what was left of the hill was bare and scorched. Dark rivers of Angelic blood still ran down its sides and formed rank pools at its base. Dirt and debris, including uprooted trees and boulders, littered the area.

环绕着残存山丘的地球表面光秃秃的，被烧焦了。天使血液的暗流仍沿着山坡流淌，在其底部形成了恶臭的池塘。泥土和碎片，包括被连根拔起的树木和大石块，散落一地。

Nothing... Nothing... Nothing... There!

什么都没有...什么都没有...什么都没有...看！

It was a splash of purple against the rubble. I could just make out Unit 01's right arm and horn in amongst where the debris was at its thickest. Just where several tree trunks and boulders were all clumped together next to one of the largest pools of Angel blood at the base of the hill.

在废墟中，一抹紫色格外显眼。我勉强辨认出零号机右臂和角的部分，正位于碎片最密集之处，那里几根树干与巨石交错堆叠，紧邻山脚下最大的一滩使徒血液。

"Shinji!" "真嗣！"

I raced Unit 02 down to the bottom of the slope and frantically started pulling huge logs and boulders away from the upper half of the purple Evangelion. As I pulled away the last of the rubble Unit 01 began to slide down into the bloody pool even further.

我急速将二号机冲至斜坡底部，疯狂地开始将巨大的圆木和巨石从紫色福音战士的上半身移开。当我清除掉最后一块瓦砾时，初号机开始进一步滑入血泊之中。

"Oh no you don't!"

"哦，你可别想！"

I leapt into the pool, the blood coming up to my Eva's waist, and scooped up Unit 01 underneath its arms. It hung limply in my grasp.

我纵身跃入泳池，血水漫至伊娃的腰际，我伸手从腋下托起零号机，它在我手中无力地垂挂着。

"Shinji! Come on! Answer me if you're in there! Help me!" I said, straining to lift the Bio-mechanoid onto the bank of the pool.

"真嗣！快点！在里面的话就回答我！帮帮我！" 我一边说着，一边费力地将生物机械体拖到池边。

Still nothing. The giant robot remained lifeless in Unit 02's arms. I placed it gently on the bare ground. I could feel the panic starting to twist in my guts.

依旧毫无动静。巨型机器人静止不动地躺在二号机怀里。我轻手轻脚地将其放置在裸露的地面上。我能感觉到恐慌开始在腹中翻搅。

"Shinji!" I was yelling now. "Come on! Answer me! Don't you dare fucking die on me now Shinji! Don't you even think about it! Come on!" I was verging on hysterical. Unit 01's eyes remained dark, devoid of life.

"真嗣！" 我此刻正大声呼喊着，"快点！回答我！你敢现在给我死掉试试，真嗣！连想都别想！快点！" 我几乎要陷入歇斯底里。初号机的眼睛依旧黯淡无光，毫无生机。

I had to get him out of there. Out of that monster. I made Unit 02 roll the purple Unit over and deployed my progressive knife. The shouts and orders coming from Misato over the Com channel were just noise to me at that stage. I don't even remember being aware of them. The timer was counting down. 22 seconds of auxiliary power left. I braced Unit 02 against Unit 01's shoulder and dug the prog knife into the Entry Plug armour plate on its back.

我必须把他从那里救出来，远离那个怪物。我操控零号机将紫色机体翻转，并部署了我的高振动粒子刀。那时，通讯频道中来自美里的大喊和指令对我来说只是杂音，我甚至不记得自己是否意识到它们。计时器在倒数，辅助动力仅剩 22 秒。我让零号机抵住初号机的肩膀，将高振动刀深深刺入其插入栓装甲板的背部。

"I'm sorry Shinji!" I said, tears streaming down my face. "But I have to get you out of there! You-you can't die in there! You can't die... because... because I-I love you, you idiot! Don't you understand? You can't die, I won't let you die, because I love you!" No answer came from the Eva as I used the knife to lever the protective plate open.

"对不起，真嗣！" 我哽咽着说，泪水顺着脸颊滑落。"但我必须把你救出来！你不能死在里面！你不能死...因为...因为我爱你，你这个笨蛋！你还不明白吗？你不能死，我不会让你死的，因为我爱你！" 我用刀子撬开防护板，但初号机没有回应。

9 Seconds Power remaining. The interior lighting of my plug had turned red in warning. I ignored it.

剩余电量 9 秒。我的插件内部照明已转为红色警告，我选择无视。

Finally I ripped the plate off and tossed it into the lake of blood. The entry plug ejected about two thirds of the way out of the back of Unit 01, venting LCL as it did. I grabbed it with my Eva's hand and wrenched it free of the purple prototype placed it gently onto some clear ground just as the world went dark. Unit 02 had exhausted its battery power. There was a jolt as the Entry Plug was automatically ejected and the LCL rapidly drained from around me.

最终，我撕下那块板子，将其扔进了血湖之中。插入栓从零号机背部约三分之二处弹出，同时排放着 LCL。我用 EVA 的手抓住它，用力将其从紫色原型机中拽出，并轻轻放置在一片干净的空地上，就在这时，世界陷入了黑暗。二号机的电池能量已耗尽。随着插入栓自动弹出，周围的 LCL 迅速排空，我感到一阵震动。

I hacked and retched as my lungs went through the painful process of expelling the fluid from them and replacing it with the cold harsh air. I waited impatiently for the ear popping 'psssht' as the Entry Plug depressurised.

我咳嗽着，喘息着，肺部经历着痛苦的过程，将液体排出，代之以寒冷刺骨的空气。我不耐烦地等待着插入栓减压时那令人耳膜一震的“嘶嘶”声。

I don't really remember opening my plug or even climbing down Unit 02 to get to ground level. I can remember the feel of the rough ground against the thin soles of the feet of my Plugsuit. I remember tripping in an exposed tree root as I ran to where Unit 01's plug lay. I didn't even realise at the time that I had ripped my plugsuit in the fall, or that I was bleeding from the right arm, hip and knee through those rents until much later.

我记不太清是否打开了我的插入栓，甚至不记得是如何从二号机爬下来到达地面的。我能记得的是，粗糙的地面紧贴着插入服薄薄的鞋底，那种触感。我记得在奔向初号机插入栓所在之处时，被裸露的树根绊了一跤。直到许久之后，我才意识到自己在跌倒中撕裂了插入服，右臂、臀部和膝盖透过破口渗出了血迹。

I made it to the plug finally. I pulled out the flush fitting butterfly handles of the emergency hatch. They were scorching hot to the touch, causing the gloves of my plug suit to split and fall away, but I held on and twisted them with all of my strength.

我终于到达了插头。我拔出了紧急舱口的平齐式蝴蝶手柄，它们触感滚烫，导致我的插头服手套裂开脱落，但我紧握不放，用尽全力扭转它们。

'Come on...Come on...' They were refusing to budge. I could feel the skin on my hands beginning to blister in the heat. I braced both feet against the plug and heaved again. I kept straining even as I dimly aware of the whine of V-TOLs approaching the blast site.

'来吧...来吧...' 他们就是不肯动。我能感觉到手上的皮肤在高温下开始起泡。我双脚抵住插头，再次用力。即使隐约听到垂直起降飞机接近爆炸现场的嗡嗡声，我仍然在不断使劲。

With a screech of metal the handles began to move, and all of a sudden they spun around 180 degrees and the hatch popped out. I wrenched it open, ignoring the excess LCL that washed over my feet.

随着金属的尖锐摩擦声，把手开始移动，突然间它们旋转了 180 度，舱门弹了出来。我用力拉开它，不顾涌过脚面的多余 LCL。

"Shinji!" I yelled as I climbed into the plug.

"真嗣！" 我一边喊着，一边爬进了插入栓。

It took my eyes a couple of seconds to adjust to the gloom inside Shinji's plug. There he was. I could make out the white of his plug suit still in the control seat. I clambered up the cramped space of the Entry Plug. I could hear his rasping breaths. He was Alive!

我的眼睛花了好几秒钟才适应了真嗣插入栓内的昏暗。他在那里。我还能辨认出他那白色插入栓服依旧坐在控制座椅上。我费力地爬上了狭窄的插入栓空间。我能听到他那急促的呼吸声。他还活着！

There was no room in there for anything else, so I sat straddling him in the control seat as I shook his shoulders trying to rouse him. He let out a few moans before coughing a few times. I small trickle of blood ran from his nose as he coughed but after a couple more sputters and gasps his eyes fluttered open.

那里没有多余的空间，所以我跨坐在控制座位上，摇晃着他的肩膀试图唤醒他。他先是发出几声呻吟，接着咳嗽了几下。随着咳嗽，一小股血从他的鼻子里流了出来，但在几次喘息和呛咳之后，他的眼睛终于颤动着睁开了。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Shinji!" I cried, tears streaming down my cheeks as I collapsed into his arms. "Oh Shinji, I thought that I'd lost you!" I said, beginning to sob into his chest.

"真嗣！" 我哭喊着，泪水顺着脸颊流淌，我倒在了他的怀里。"哦，真嗣，我以为我失去你了！" 我说着，开始在他胸前抽泣。

I felt his arms envelope me. I felt so happy at that moment. So safe.

我感觉到他的双臂环绕着我。那一刻，我感到无比幸福，如此安心。

"I told you Asuka." He said weakly between coughs. "I told you that I would never leave you."

"我跟你说过了，明日香。" 他虚弱地在咳嗽间说道，"我告诉过你，我永远不会离开你。"

I snuggled deeper into his embrace, I heard him give a short intake of breath as I moved against him.

我更深地依偎进他的怀抱，当我贴近他时，听见他短促地吸了一口气。

"You're hurt?" I said with worry.

"你受伤了吗？" 我关切地问道。

"I'll live." He said with a smile in his voice.

"我会活下去。" 他带着笑意说道。

"I love you, Baka Shinji."

我爱你，笨蛋真嗣。

"You better." 你更好。

I sat back up and looked him in the eye. "Don't get cute with me, Third Child." I said in mock ire.

我重新坐直，直视他的眼睛。“别跟我耍小聪明，三娃子。”我佯装生气地说。

"Uh...sorry." 呃...对不起。

"Hmmm..." "嗯..."

"What?" He said, a little confused.

"什么？" 他说，有些困惑。

"Well?" "嗯？"

"Uh... I love you too Asuka."

"呃... 我也爱你，明日香。"

"That's more like it." I said snuggling back into him.

“这才像话嘛。”我边说边又依偎回他身边。

We stayed like that until the recovery teams arrived to retrieve us. In fact they had to wait for Misato to arrive and give us a direct order to let go of each other before they could manage to load us all into a Medivac VTOL to take us back to the NERV Infirmary.

我们一直保持那样的状态，直到救援队到达来接我们。实际上，他们必须等到碇司令到达并直接命令我们放开彼此，才能设法将我们全部装载进医疗救援垂直起降机，带我们返回 NERV 医务室。

Misato didn't say a word to us the whole trip back as the Paramedics bound up Shinji's arms and treated my cuts with antiseptic salves.

整个回程中，美里一句话也没对我们说，而急救人员则忙着给真嗣的双臂包扎，并用消毒药膏处理我的伤口。

You know what. I didn't care. I was where I wanted to be. Where I needed to be.

你知道吗，我不在乎。我就在我想在的地方，我需要的地方。

Where I was going to stay.

我要住的地方。

With Shinji. 与真嗣一起。

End Chapter 8 第八章结束

A/N: Possibly the hardest chapter to write. I swear I probably took nearly as long writing this chapter as all of the rest combined. It's also probably the one I'm least happy with, narrative wise. Please let me know what you think!

作者注：这可能是我写过最难的一章。我发誓，写这一章所花的时间几乎和写其他所有章节加起来一样长。从叙事角度来说，这大概也是我最不满意的一章。请告诉我你的想法！

## Chapter 9 Alea Iacta Est. 骰子已经掷出。

{"Now what I want is, Facts."

{"现在我要的是，事实。"

"No." Even I was surprised by the coldness of the reply.

"不。" 连我自己都惊讶于回复的冷漠。

Dear God my arms hurt. Asuka was sitting next to me at the table, squeezing my bandaged hand tightly, which was both comforting and also quite painful.}

天啊，我的胳膊好痛。明日香坐在我旁边的桌子旁，紧紧握着我包扎好的手，这既让人感到安慰，也相当痛苦。

We had been released from the Infirmary after only a couple of hours. Well, that is to say I had been released after a couple of hours. Asuka, whose injuries amounted to a couple of scrapes and a bruised hip, had never been admitted in the first place. But she had refused to leave my side throughout the entirety of my stay there. That was fine by me, though I was a little over her grinning and telling me to 'suck it up' every time I winced or complained about how my arms hurt.

我们只在医务室待了几个小时就被放出来了。嗯，确切地说，是待了几个小时后被放出来的。明日香，她的伤不过是几处擦伤和一个淤青的髋部，压根就没被收治。但她拒绝在我住院期间离开我半步。这对我来说倒也无妨，尽管每次我皱眉或抱怨手臂疼痛时，她那副咧嘴笑让我“忍着点”的样子让我有点受不了。

My souvenir from the battle with this particular Angel was two long angry scars running down each of my forearms and ending in an exit wound of sorts at each elbow. This was the first time that I had actually gained any permanent marks from a battle. Dr Akagi explained that my Synchronisation Level had spiked for a short period as I had strained to keep the Angel from touching the Earth.

与这只特定使徒战斗的纪念品是我双臂上各有两道长长的、愤怒的疤痕，它们在每个肘部以一种类似出口伤口的方式结束。这是我第一次在战斗中留下永久性的痕迹。赤木博士解释说，当我竭力阻止使徒触地时，我的同步率短暂飙升。

The higher the Synchronisation the more connected you are to the Evangelion. The more connected you are to the Evangelion, the more you feel what it feels. This is all fine and/or dandy. Until a twelve storey tall alien sticks something sharp and pointy into your Eva. Then it gets considerably less fine and a lot less dandy.

同步率越高，你与福音战士的连接就越紧密。与福音战士连接越紧密，你就能越深切地感受到它的感受。这一切都挺好，或者说挺棒的。直到一个十二层楼高的外星生物用尖锐的东西刺入你的福音战士，情况就变得不那么好了，也远没有那么棒了。

If that's what I got from a high Synch Ratio then I wasn't all that sure that I really wanted to get much higher than I was, thanks all the same.

如果高同步率给我带来的就是这种体验，那我真不确定自己是否还想再提高同步率，谢谢了。

Dr Akagi seemed surprisingly indifferent to the way Asuka was clinging to me as she bandaged up my arms. The redhead was fussing over me and watching the blonde Doctor's every move. Questioning her about the scars and how she was treating them and generally chattering away in a very un-Asuka like fashion.

赤木医生似乎对明日香在给我包扎手臂时紧贴着我的方式出奇地漠不关心。这位红发女孩对我关怀备至，同时紧盯着金发医生的每一个动作。她询问着我的伤疤以及治疗方式，并以一种非常不像明日香的风格喋喋不休。

"Keep these bandages on for at least the next week Shinji." Ritsuko said after she had finished wrapping up my forearms. "It's a waterproof dressing so it's fine to have them on in the shower."

真嗣，这些绷带至少要保留一周。" 绫波在完成我的前臂包扎后说道，"这是防水敷料，所以洗澡时戴着也没问题。

"That's all well and good, Doctor." Asuka interrupted. "But what if there's another Angel attack? Will they stand up to being immersed in LCL? That stuff soaks into everything! My hair gets ruined every time! I have to use those industrial strength cleansers in the Nerv showers to get that crap out of it!"

那都挺好的，医生。" 明日香打断道，"但如果再有使徒袭击怎么办？它们能承受 LCL 的浸泡吗？那东西渗透力太强了！每次我的头发都被毁了！我得用 Nerv 淋浴间里那些工业级强力清洁剂才能把那玩意儿洗掉！

"Asuka... " I tried to say, it was useless.

"明日香... " 我试图说，但无济于事。

"And another thing!" She continued. "How soon will Shinji be able to... Ummm... you know... return to his...erm... usual activities? You know... Ummm... yeah... like cooking and cleaning and stuff? Is there any danger of... Ummm... over exertion causing him any harm?" Strangely she was beginning to blush as she said this.

"还有一件事！"她接着说，"真嗣多久能……嗯……你知道的……回到他……呃……日常活动？比如做饭、打扫之类的？有没有过度劳累给他带来伤害的风险？"奇怪的是，她说到这里开始脸红了。

Dr Akagi raised an eyebrow and said nothing for several moments. "Hmmmm..." She said, looking at the two of us in a most uncomfortable and appraising way. I could feel the heat burning in my cheeks. Doctor Ritsuko Akagi was one of the most brilliant and intelligent individuals on the entire planet. When she looked at you with the full force of her reason and intellect, you may as well be stark naked and waving a banner proclaiming your deepest secrets and insecurities for her shallow amusement.

赤木博士挑了挑眉毛，沉默了好几秒。“嗯……”她开口道，用一种极为不适且审视的目光打量着我们俩。我能感觉到脸颊上的热意。赤木律子博士是整个星球上最聪明绝顶的人物之一。当她用她那强大的理性和智慧全神贯注地审视你时，你简直就像赤身裸体，挥舞着一面宣告你内心最深秘密和不安的旗帜，只为博她一时的浅薄娱乐。

"Hmmmm..." She repeated, before scribbling down some notes on a pad her clipboard. She looked back up at us. "No, there's no risk of opening the wounds, and those bandages will remain sealed beneath Shinji's Plug Suit, so the LCL will not be able to come into contact with them at all. Shinji, you should be fine to resume your, erm, normal level of activity as soon as you feel comfortable."

"嗯……"她重复道，随后在夹板上的便签本上匆匆记下几笔。她抬头再次看向我们，"不，打开伤口没有风险，而且那些绷带会在真嗣的插入服下保持密封，所以 LCL 根本无法接触到它们。真嗣，只要你觉得舒服，就可以恢复到你平时的活动水平了。"

"Thanks!" Replied Asuka brightly. Beaming at me and giving my arm a painful squeeze. I was feeling less reassured though. Why did I have the feeling that Ritsuko knew everything that Asuka and I had been doing and trying to keep secret for all of these weeks now?

"谢谢！"明日香明快地回答道。她朝我灿烂一笑，用力捏了捏我的胳膊，虽然有些疼，但我却感到不那么安心。为什么我会有种感觉，觉得律子似乎知道我和明日香这几周以来一直在秘密进行的一切呢？

With a couple more ticks and notes on her clipboard I was discharged from Dr Akagi's care. We walked arm in arm out of the main doors on the Geofront side of the Infirmary. The spectacular vista of the lake and pyramid spread out before us. Asuka let go of my arm and wrapped herself around me, pressing her lips against my own in a gentle kiss. A gentle kiss that was shortly followed by a swift smack to the back of the head.

在她的写字板上又记了几笔后，我从赤木医生的照料下出院了。我们挽着手臂走出了位于 Geofront 一侧的医务室主门。眼前展开的是湖泊与金字塔的壮丽景色。明日香松开我的手臂，紧紧抱住我，轻柔地吻上了我的唇。这个温柔的吻之后，紧接着的是后脑勺上的一记轻拍。

"Oww!" I said more in surprise than pain. "What was that for?"

"哎呀！" 我更多的是惊讶而非疼痛。"这是为什么呀？"

She held me even more tightly than before, I could see some hints of excess moisture in her clear blue eyes. "That was for trying to be the Hero and scaring me like that!" She said. Then she pressed her lips to mine again in a deeper and more urgent kiss. "And that is for trying to be the Hero and making it out okay!" She said after she broke off.

她比以往任何时候都更紧地抱住我，我能在她清澈的蓝眼睛里看到些许过度的湿润。“那是为了试图成为英雄，还那样吓唬我！”她说。随后，她再次将唇紧贴在我的唇上，这次是一个更深沉、更迫切的吻。“而这是为了试图成为英雄，并且平安无事地挺过来！”她分开后说道。

"Uh.. Thanks, I guess." "呃... 谢谢，我想。"

"You're welcome!" 不客气！

"So... Asuka?" 那么...是明日香吗？

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"So... you're okay with everyone knowing about... well about us now?"

那么……你对于所有人都知道我们的事……嗯，关于我们的事，现在没问题了吗？

"Why Shinji? Are you embarrassed to be seen canoodling in public with a beautiful and exotic Mecha Pilot with her very own college degree? I didn't realise that your standards were so high!"

"为什么是真嗣？你是因为和一位拥有大学学位、美丽又异国情调的机甲驾驶员在公共场合亲昵而感到尴尬吗？没想到你的标准这么高啊！"

"N-No Asuka! You know that it's not that! It's just you said that we keep it quiet so that we wouldn't get separated or you know... in trouble or anything like that!"

不，不，明日香！你知道不是那样的！只是你说过我们要保持低调，以免分开或者你知道的...遇到麻烦或类似的事情！

"I know that I said that, Shinji. But you know what? Fuck them! I don't really give a rat's ass whether they cluck their tongues or waggle their fingers at us and tell us that we're naughty children! We're not God-Damned children anymore Shinji! In case you hadn't noticed, we fight their battles for them and save their asses time after time and what do we get in return? Seven parts of Fuck All and not much else! Wouldn't you agree?"

我知道我这么说过，真嗣。但你知道吗？去他们的！我才不在乎他们咂舌或对我们指指点点，说我们是淘气的孩子！我们他妈的已经不是孩子了，真嗣！如果你还没注意到，我们为他们战斗，一次又一次地救了他们，我们得到了什么回报？七分之一的狗屁和没别的！你不同意吗？

"Well... yeah, I guess." I said.

"嗯... 是啊，我想是的。" 我说道。

"You know it! And you know what else? I realised something today, when I was pulling your Eva out of that pile of blood and crap! I realised that if you died I would have nothing left to live for. Not Eva, not Misato, nothing! I realised that I do love you, you great big dork! I love you and I don't care anymore who knows it!"

你知道的！还有你知道别的吗？今天我在把你从那堆血和垃圾中拉出来的时候，我意识到了一件事！我意识到如果你死了，我就没有任何活下去的理由了。不是为了 Eva，不是为了 Misato，什么都不是！我意识到我真的爱你，你这个大傻瓜！我爱你，我不在乎谁知道了！

"I love you too Asuka."

“我也爱你，明日香。”

"I know... And I've never felt that before. Ever... Actually loving someone and knowing that they love you back. Never! Never in my entire fucking life has anyone actually said that they loved me and I could know that it was because of who I am and not what I do." Tears were starting to roll down her cheeks now. "You do, don't you Shinji? You'd love me even if I was just an ordinary, albeit strikingly beautiful, girl. Wouldn't you?"

我知道...而且我以前从未有过这种感觉。真的...真心爱着某人，并且知道他们也爱着你。从来没有！在我这该死的整个人生中，从未有人真正说过他们爱我，而我能明白这是因为我本身，而不是我所做的。" 泪水开始从她的脸颊滑落。"你是这样的，对吧，真嗣？即使我只是个普通，尽管美丽非凡的女孩，你也会爱我，对吗？"

I kissed her forehead. "You could never be ordinary to me Asuka. But yes, I would love you even if you were just an ordinary, though strikingly beautiful and intelligent girl. Even though ordinary is something you could never be!"

我吻了吻她的额头。“你对我来说永远不可能平凡，明日香。但没错，即使你只是一个普通却惊人地美丽和聪明的女孩，我也会爱你。尽管平凡是你永远不可能成为的！”

She sniffled away some of the tears and smiled at me. "Why Shinji Ikari, where did you learn to become such a smooth-talker?"

她吸了吸鼻子，拭去一些泪水，对我微笑道：“真嗣，你怎么变得这么会说话了？”

I blushed a little."J-Just a natural I g-guess."

我脸颊微红，“呃，可能只是本能反应吧。”

She blushed adorably as well. "Baka." She said softly. I knew that it was a sign of the highest trust and affection. She kissed me again. "Although maybe we shouldn't necessarily advertise the fact that we are actually sleeping together. I don't want the entire school, and NERV personnel roster for that matter, thinking that we're at it like a couple of Bonobos on Spring Break!"

她也可爱地脸红了。“笨蛋。”她轻声说道。我知道这是最高信任和情感的标志。她再次吻了我。“虽然我们或许不应该大肆宣扬我们实际上是同床共枕的事实。我不想让整个学校，乃至 NERV 的人员名单上的人都认为我们像春假时的倭黑猩猩一样疯狂！”

"A couple of whos on what?"

"几个谁的什么？"

She sighed. "Never mind. Let's go home already! I want to get back to the apartment before it gets dark."

她叹了口气。“算了，我们回家吧！我想在天黑前回到公寓。”

"Okay." 好的。

But we didn't actually start going anywhere. We stood there in each other's arms just kissing and holding each other, making the most of each other touch and presence. Asuka's lips were so soft and sweet that I could have just stood there for the rest of the day doing nothing else and I wouldn't have cared one bit. I can't help but feeling that she also felt the same.

但我们其实并未真正前往任何地方。我们就那样站在彼此的怀抱中，只是亲吻和拥抱，尽情享受着对方的触碰和存在。明日香的唇柔软而甜美，我本可以就这样站上一整天，什么都不做，也毫不在意。我不禁觉得，她也有着同样的感觉。

But my Strawberry Balsam heaven was sadly to be cut short for that day.

然而，那天我的草莓凤仙花天堂却不幸地被突然打断了。

"Ahem." "嗯哼。"

Asuka stiffened in my arms. We both knew that voice. The one in some ways we had both been dreading the most. We disentangled from our embrace and stood to face its owner together.

明日香在我怀里僵住了。我们俩都认得那个声音。某种程度上，我们最害怕的就是它。我们松开了拥抱，一起站起来面对声音的主人。

"Uh... Hi Misato." I said sheepishly.

"呃... 嗨，碇真嗣。" 我有些尴尬地说。

"Hey Misato." Asuka said with more confidence than I could manage.

"嘿，美里。" 明日香说道，她的自信是我难以企及的。

Our guardian just let out a tired sigh. "I'm here to take you home." She said with little inflection.

我们的守护者刚刚发出了一声疲惫的叹息。“我是来带你回家的。”她语气平淡地说道。

"Th-that's okay Misato. We don't mind walking, do we Asuka?"

“没关系的，美里。我们不介意走路，对吧，明日香？”

"Yep, in fact I think that I'd like to walk home with Shinji today. Thanks for your offer and all." Asuka said lightly.

"嗯，其实我想今天和真嗣一起走回家。谢谢你的提议。" 明日香轻声说道。

"No." Again Misato's voice was flat. "I'm not going to let you walk home. You've been injured. I'm taking you both home, now. We need to talk." There was no denying her when she used that voice.

"不行。" 米萨托的声音再次平淡无波。"我不会让你走回家的。你受伤了。我现在要带你们两个回家，我们需要谈谈。" 当她用那种语气说话时，没有人能否认她。

"Sure, Misato." I replied. I could feel Asuka's annoyance spike beside me. "We were just about to go home anyway."

"当然，美里。"我回答道。我能感觉到旁边的明日香怒气值飙升。"我们本来也正准备回家。"

"Fine." Misato said. "Let's go then." The Operations Director of NERV turned without further ado and walked towards the main parking garages of the Geo front. We fell into step behind her. Asuka shot me a rather pointed questioning look.

"好吧。" 美里说，"那我们走吧。" NERV 的作战部长没有多说，转身朝着 Geo 前方的主要停车库走去。我们跟在她后面。明日香向我投来一个相当尖锐的询问眼神。

"We have to tell her sooner or later Asuka." I said in a hushed voice as we followed Misato. "We owe her the truth. After all the whole of NERV seems to know about us now, so she knows that we've been keeping secrets from her!"

“我们迟早得告诉明日香。” 我低声说道，同时跟着美里。“我们有责任告诉她真相。毕竟，整个 NERV 现在似乎都知道我们的事了，所以她知道我们一直在对她隐瞒秘密！”

"I guess so." Asuka replied. "But she doesn't have to be so shitty about it!"

“我想是的。”明日香回答道，“但她也没必要这么差劲吧！”

"She'll be okay, once we explain it all to her." I said. I wished I could have believed my own words.

“一旦我们向她解释清楚，她就会没事的。”我说道。真希望我能相信自己的话。

Misato didn't say another word to either of us for the whole drive home. Asuka and I sat together in the back seat, holding hands and communicating more by looks that by speech.

整个回家的路上，Misato 没有再对我们俩说一句话。Asuka 和我坐在后座，手牵手，更多地通过眼神而非言语交流。

We reached the apartment just as the twilight gloom faded into sodium lit night. At least the elevators had been repaired, though it was an awkward ride up. The tension emanating from Misato felt like it was sucking all of the air out of the Lift-car.

我们抵达公寓时，暮色正逐渐被钠灯照亮的夜色所取代。至少电梯已经修好了，尽管上升的过程颇为尴尬。从碇真嗣身上散发出的紧张感，仿佛将电梯内的空气都吸走了。

Entering the apartment, my home and some-time prison, the sense of comfort I usually felt whenever I entered that place was somehow lacking this time around.

踏入公寓，我的家亦是偶尔的牢笼，往常一进门便油然而生的舒适感，这次却莫名缺失。

We sat and waited for our guardian to change clothes and return. My stomach was twisted up into something resembling one of those big German pretzel things and my hands were clammy with sweat. I could see that Asuka was feeling the same, although trying to hide it. She gave me a small peck on the lips. Just at that time Misato came back into the kitchen. She was in her usual cut-offs and tank top and her hair was up in a pony-tail. I appreciated that. She was showing that she was handling this as our guardian and room-mate, not as commanding officer.

我们坐下来等待监护人换好衣服回来。我的胃纠结成一团，像是那种巨大的德国椒盐卷饼，双手因汗水而湿滑。我能看出明日香也有同样的感觉，尽管她试图掩饰。她轻轻地吻了我的唇。就在那时，美里回到了厨房。她穿着平常的短裤和背心，头发扎成马尾。我很感激这一点。她以我们的监护人和室友的身份处理这一切，而非指挥官的角色。

However, her demeanour was still unchanged as she pulled a beer from the fridge, cracked it open and took a long drink from it before she sat down across from us at the table.

然而，她的举止依旧如常，从冰箱里拿出一瓶啤酒，打开后大口畅饮一番，然后才坐到我们对面的桌旁。

"After the Angel was destroyed... We re-established Communications with Commander Ikari." She said finally, in a flat emotionless tone. "I apologised to him for the damage to the Units 01 and 00 sustained during the battle because of my reckless plan."

在使徒被摧毁后……我们重新与碇司令建立了通讯。”她最终以一种平淡无情的语气说道，“我为战斗中由于我的鲁莽计划导致 01 和 00 号机受到的损害向他道歉。”

"S-So was my Father angry with you for that?"

"所以，我父亲是因为那件事对你生气了吗？"

"No." She replied taking a large gulp of her Yebisu. "He said the destruction of the Angel out-weighed the damage to the Evangelions."

"不。" 她回答道，同时大口喝了一口她的惠比寿啤酒。"他说天使的毁灭比对福音战士造成的损害更重要。"

I opened my mouth to speak, but I was too puzzled by our guardian's mood to think of anything to actually say. I closed my mouth again.

我张开嘴想要说话，但守护者的情绪让我困惑不已，以至于我实在想不出该说什么。于是，我又闭上了嘴。

"So, I was in a debriefing with the Commander and Sub-Commander for over three hours, before I came to pick you up. They had seen the footage and audio of the battle beforehand."

所以，我在与指挥官和副指挥官的汇报中度过了三个多小时，之后才来接你。他们之前已经看过战斗的视频和音频了。

"Oh." Asuka said. "哦。" 明日香说道。

"Yes. 'Oh' is right." 是的，“哦”是对的。

"So... They heard me when I said that I... " Asuka didn't get to finish her sentence.

所以... 当我说我... 的时候，他们听到了。" 明日香没能说完这句话。

"They heard you." Misato interrupted her. It felt like a stone had settled in my guts when I heard her say that.

"他们听到了你。" 碇真嗣打断了她。当听到她这么说时，我感觉像是有块石头沉甸甸地压在了我的胃里。

"Are-Are they angry?" I asked.

"他们-他们生气了吗？" 我问道。

"No, far from it." Misato replied, finishing her beer and getting up to get another from the fridge. "As a matter of fact, he knows all about it." She said as she sat back down heavily in the chair.

"不，远非如此。" 葛城美里回答道，喝完啤酒后起身从冰箱里又拿了一瓶。"事实上，他对此一清二楚。" 她边说边重重地坐回椅子上。

"What?" Both Asuka and I exclaimed in unison.

"什么？" 我和明日香异口同声地惊呼道。

"That's right." She said with a hint of bitterness. "He has known for weeks, apparently. I can't say that I can say the same for myself."

"没错。" 她带着一丝苦涩说道，"显然，他已经知道好几个星期了。我可不敢说自己也有同样的了解。"

"Misato, I can... " I tried to say.

"Misato，我可以说……" 我试图说道。

"No, Shinji, you can't. Whatever it is, you can't explain this away!" She said, finally revealing the anger underneath her previously flat demeanour. "You can't explain how I found out from Commander Ikari that my two top pilots, and wards in my care, have been fucking each other for weeks now under my own roof! Can you Shinji!"

“不，真嗣，你做不到。无论是什么，你都无法解释清楚！”她终于揭露了之前平静外表下隐藏的愤怒，“你无法解释我是如何从碇司令那里得知，我的两个顶尖驾驶员，也是我照顾下的孩子，竟然在我自己的屋檐下厮混了好几周！你能解释吗，真嗣！”

"Misato... " I said in shock.

"Misato..." 我震惊地说道。

"You know what the Commander, your Father, said Shinji?"

你知道司令，也就是你父亲，对真嗣说了什么吗？

I shook my head.

我摇了摇头。

"He mentioned Asuka's outburst during the battle, you know, where she said she... she said that she loved you. I started to explain that I thought it was just a heat of the moment thing, but he interrupted me. He-He said, and I quote. "I am well aware, Captain, that the Second and Third Child have been sleeping together for some time now." Can you imagine how that felt? Can you even begin?"

他提到了战斗中明日香爆发的那一刻，你知道的，她说她...她说她爱你。我本想解释那只是当时情绪激动所致，但他打断了我。他——他说，我引用一下：“我很清楚，上尉，第二和第三适格者已经同床共枕一段时间了。”你能想象那是什么感觉吗？你甚至能开始理解吗？

I couldn't speak. Fear. Fear of my Father and what he could do to us paralysed me. And shame. The shame of having kept secrets from Misato, the first person who had ever taken me in and shown me true kindness. Asuka, however, had no such problem.

我无法开口。恐惧，对父亲的恐惧，以及他可能对我们造成的伤害让我动弹不得。还有羞愧，对向真嗣隐瞒秘密的羞愧，她是第一个接纳我并给予我真正善意的人。然而，明日香却没有这样的困扰。

"So," She said. "What else did he say about us? I don't see Section 2 breaking the door down and dragging us away yet. What is he going to do with us?"

“那么，”她说，“他还说了我们什么？我还没看到第二部分的人破门而入把我们拖走。他打算怎么处置我们？”

"The Commander? He apparently couldn't care less what you two do. His only comment, apart from reprimanding me on not keeping up to date on what my Pilots were doing, was that as long as your Piloting duties were unaffected, he didn't feel the need to bother himself with the personal lives of NERV employees."

指挥官？他显然对你们俩做什么毫不在意。他除了责备我没有及时了解我的飞行员在做什么之外，唯一的评论是，只要你们的飞行任务不受影响，他觉得没有必要去干涉 NERV 员工的私生活。

My Father said that? I was torn between relief and anger. Relief that my Father, the man who had seemed to go out of his way to fuck up my life thus far, wouldn't be interfering in my greatest happiness. Yet. And anger at his continued indifference to me, his only child.

我父亲真的这么说了吗？我陷入了宽慰与愤怒的矛盾之中。一方面，我感到宽慰，因为那个似乎总是刻意破坏我迄今为止生活的父亲，不会干涉我最大的幸福。至少目前不会。另一方面，我又感到愤怒，因为他对我，他唯一的孩子的持续漠视。

But there was still an extremely angry Misato Katsuragi to deal with.

但还有一个怒不可遏的葛城美里需要应对。

"So, you're not going to try to deny that you've been sleeping together behind my back?"

那么，你不会试图否认你们背着我同床共枕的事实吧？

"Would there be a point?"Asuka asked.

"这有什么意义吗？" 明日香问道。

"Hmmm... No."Misato said in response, before draining the second can of Yebisu. She got up again and fetched yet another can from the refrigerator.

"嗯...不。" 碇真嗣回答道，随后喝完了第二罐惠比寿啤酒。她再次起身，从冰箱里又拿了一罐。

"Now what I want is, facts." She said as she sat back down.

“现在我想要的，是事实。”她说着，重新坐了下来。

"No." Even I was surprised by the coldness of Asuka's reply.

"不。" 连我都对明日香那冷冰冰的回答感到惊讶。

"What do you mean, 'No'?" Misato asked in annoyance.

"你说的'不'是什么意思？" 惱怒的碇真嗣问道。

"I mean No, you don't get to demand answers from us about this, Misato!" Asuka shot back, not to be cowed by the older woman's ire. "We may live under your roof, but you do not own us! You do not get to treat us like Children!"

"我是说，不，你没有权利就这件事向我们索要答案，葛城小姐！" 明日香反驳道，毫不畏惧这位年长女性的怒火。"我们虽然住在你的屋檐下，但你不拥有我们！你没有权利把我们当小孩子对待！"

"But you are... "

但你却是……

"No!" This time Asuka put more force into the word. "Don't you dare even say it! I don't give a fuck who you are or how you think we should behave! We risk our asses for NERV every God-Damned day! We get stuck in giant experimental killing machines to fight huge fucking alien monsters Hell-bent on destroying Humanity! We get blown up, probed, stabbed with energy beams, thrown in fucking lava and dragged through the sea as bait to be impaled on enormous and unbelievably painful Angel teeth! Does our beloved Guardian and Commanding Officer raise even a token objection to that? Let me answer that one for you Misato! No, you fucking well don't! You don't because it suits you to have us do it! It makes your job easier! More importantly it makes you look good in front of the Commander!"

"不！"这次明日香加重了语气。"你敢再说一次试试！我他妈才不管你是谁，或者你认为我们应该怎么表现！我们每天都在为 NERV 冒着生命危险！我们被困在巨大的实验性杀人机器里，去对抗那些一心想要毁灭人类的巨大外星怪物！我们被炸飞，被探测，被能量束刺穿，被扔进滚烫的岩浆，还被拖过海洋当作诱饵，被巨大的、难以置信的痛苦的天使之牙刺穿！我们敬爱的守护者和指挥官对此有过哪怕一丝的反对吗？让我来替你回答吧，美里！没有，你他妈的根本没有！你没有，因为这对你有利！这会让你的工作更轻松！更重要的是，这会让你在指挥官面前显得更出色！"

"Asuka..." Misato tried to say, but the redhead ploughed on.

"明日香……" 葛城尝试开口，但红发少女却继续说下去。

"You think you have the right to make demands of us? To make us behave ourselves like good boys and girls when it suits you, but as soon as we express any kind of independence or don't fit into your plans like good little soldiers, you think that you can demand answers from us to assuage your need to play Mommy?"

你以为你有权对我们提出要求吗？当我们符合你的心意时，要我们表现得像乖巧的男孩女孩，但一旦我们表现出任何独立性或不像听话的小兵那样融入你的计划，你就认为可以向我们索要答案，以满足你扮演母亲角色的需求？

Surprisingly Misato's reply was calm. "I'm not your Mother, I've never tried to be. But I have placed an enormous amount of trust in you two. And as soon as my back is turned you betray that trust..."

令人惊讶的是，葛城小姐的回答很平静。“我不是你们的母亲，也从没试图成为那样。但我对你们俩寄予了极大的信任。然而，我一转身，你们就背叛了这份信任……”

"So we get your trust to climb into the Evas and risk our lives against the Angels, then when it meets your needs we have to behave like good little dolls and do what we're told? What kind of trust is that exactly? Don't be such a hypocrite, Misato!"

所以我们获得你的信任，爬进 EVA 与天使战斗，冒着生命危险，然后当它符合你的需求时，我们就得像乖巧的小玩偶一样，听从命令行事？这究竟是怎样的信任？别这么虚伪，美里！

An uncomfortable silence settled over the apartment after Asuka's stinging words. I could see the hurt and tension in our Guardian in the way her eyes stared at the beer can in front of her, her fingers gripping it so tightly that the aluminium was dented and buckled beneath them. I felt bad for having kept this from her, but what else could we have done? So little of our own lives was under our own control. If I could show her how we felt and what it was like from our own perspective, maybe she could understand. Maybe I could soften the hurt in her eyes.

在明日香尖锐的话语之后，公寓里笼罩着一种令人不安的沉默。我能从守护者凝视着面前啤酒罐的眼神中，感受到她的伤痛和紧张，她的手指紧紧抓住罐身，以至于铝罐在她的握力下凹陷变形。我为自己对她隐瞒了这件事而感到内疚，但我们还能怎么做呢？我们自己的生活几乎不受自己掌控。如果我能向她展示我们的感受，以及从我们的视角看这一切是怎样的，或许她能理解。或许我能减轻她眼中的痛苦。

"M-Misato..." I began. "M-Misato..." 我开口道。

She looked straight at me without speaking.

她直视着我，一言不发。

"Misato, A-Asuka and I... We didn't do any of this to hurt you. We... well neither of us have experienced anything like this before. You know about me. My life before this was... well... empty I guess. I lived with my teacher, who was an old man. He didn't really know how to relate to a young boy who didn't understand why his Mother went away and his Father seemed to despise him. Academically I wasn't that adept, at least as a young child. So he used to just prefer to keep me shut up in my room so that I didn't disturb his research. It was lonely. He didn't approve of me having friends my own age around, so I kept pretty much to myself. Then Father summoned me." I paused for a moment gathering my thoughts.

美里，我和明日香……我们这么做并不是为了伤害你。我们……嗯，我们俩以前都没经历过这种事。你知道我的过去。在这之前，我的生活……嗯……可以说是空虚的。我和我的老师一起生活，他是个老人。他不知道如何与一个不理解母亲为何离去、父亲似乎又憎恶他的小男孩相处。在学术上，我小时候并不擅长。所以他总是宁愿把我关在房间里，以免我打扰他的研究。那很孤独。他不赞成我与同龄的朋友交往，所以我基本上都是独来独往。然后，父亲召唤了我。我停顿了一下，整理思绪。

"Father summoned me. For the first time that I can remember I felt hope. Maybe Father would have me come back because he wanted me, he wanted his son to be part of his life. I was so happy when I got that message, even though all it said was "Come." I had, for the first time in my life, hope that someone actually might want me. Of course when I arrived here it turned out rather differently. As you will remember Misato."

父亲召唤了我。在我记忆中，这是第一次感受到希望。或许父亲会让我回去，因为他需要我，他希望他的儿子能成为他生活的一部分。收到那条只写着“来”的信息时，我无比欣喜。在我一生中，第一次有了被人真正需要的希望。当然，当我来到这里后，情况却截然不同。正如你还记得的，美里。

Misato nodded. She was there when I had met my Father again for the first time in all those years. She, like me, heard his words: "I summoned you because I have a use for you." And "If you're going to do it, get in. If not, then Leave!"

碇真嗣点了点头。在我多年后第一次与父亲重逢时，她也在场。她和一样，听到了父亲的话：“我召唤你是因为我有用得着你的地方。”还有“如果要干，就进来。否则，就离开！”

"Yes, I remember." Misato said quietly.

"是的，我记得。" 碇真嗣轻声说道。

"So I stayed, and you took me in. You gave me a proper home for the first time in my life. Even though I know you did it out of duty, and out of pity for me and my plight, I still appreciate what you did. You gave me the closest thing to a family that I had ever had. But I was still a part of your job. I was still alone."

于是我留了下来，你接纳了我。你给了我生命中第一个真正的家。尽管我知道你是出于责任，出于对我及我困境的同情，我仍然感激你所做的一切。你给了我从未有过的最接近家庭的感觉。但我仍然是你的工作的一部分。我依旧孤单。

"I-I know that Shinji." “我-我知道那是真嗣。”

"Then you must know what Asuka and I have and what it means to me." I put my arm around Asuka and she held my hand as it lay on her shoulder. "I knew that you would be upset by it, but this is too important to me for that to stop this. I love Asuka, and she loves me. Yes we... we are sleeping together, we have been for a while now." I swallowed, even though my mouth was as dry as a desert. "And I am the happiest right now than I have ever been at any time in my entire life. Don't you understand that, Misato?"

"那么你一定知道我和明日香之间有什么，以及它对我意味着什么。" 我把手臂搭在明日香肩上，她握住了我放在她肩上的手。"我知道这会让你难过，但这件事对我来说太重要了，不能因此而停止。我爱明日香，她也爱我。是的，我们……我们在一起睡觉，已经有一段时间了。" 我咽了口唾沫，尽管我的嘴干得像沙漠一样。"我现在比以往任何时候都要幸福。难道你不明白吗，美里？"

Asuka nodded in agreement to my words and Misato sat speechless for several minutes. Eventually our guardian, and the second most important person in my life, spoke.

明日香对我的话点头表示同意，而美里则沉默了几分钟。最终，我们的监护人，也是我生命中第二重要的人，开口了。

"I... I understand what you're saying Shinji, and you too Asuka. I understand exactly." She took a deep breath. "That's what makes this so hard. Effective tomorrow morning I am going to arrange to have you move out of this apartment Asuka."

我……我明白你们的意思，真嗣，还有你，明日香。我完全理解。"她深吸了一口气，"正因为如此，这件事才这么难办。从明天早上开始，我将安排你搬出这个公寓，明日香。"

"What!" "什么！"

"Let me finish. I will arrange for you to stay with Lt Ibuki for the time being, until more appropriate accommodation can be found..."

让我说完。我会安排你暂时和伊吹中尉同住，直到找到更合适的住处为止……

"But Misato!" “但是，美里！”

"I know that it seems unfair, but that is the best thing that I can do for all of us for now. It would be negligent for me as you guardian and Commanding Officer to allow you to continue on in your current manner for..."

我知道这似乎不公平，但目前这是我能为所有人做的最好的事。作为你的监护人和指挥官，如果我让你继续以现在的方式行事，那将是我的失职……

"Misato." I interrupted. "Just shut up for a minute."

"美里。" 我打断道，"先别说话，安静一会儿。"

She stopped talking and looked at me in shock. I had never spoken to her like that before. Even Asuka looked at me like I had suddenly changed into some kind of strange creature, although her hand on mine was as tight as ever.

她停止了说话，震惊地看着我。我以前从未这样对她说过话。就连明日香也像我突然变成了某种奇怪的生物一样看着我，尽管她握着我的手依然紧得像往常一样。

"A couple of things." I continued, my anger seeming to take control of my words. "One. If you decide to follow this course of action, then I will also leave this apartment with Asuka. We will find somewhere that we can stay, together. It doesn't really matter where I live, as long I have Asuka with me. Perhaps the initial accommodation that NERV offered me before you took me in would still be available? If my Father doesn't care that we're together then I'm sure NERV would find somewhere for its two top Pilots to live!"

"几件事情。"我继续说道，愤怒似乎控制了我的话语。"第一，如果你决定走这条路，那我也会带着明日香离开这个公寓。我们会找到一个可以一起住的地方。我住在哪里并不重要，只要我和明日香在一起。也许 NERV 最初提供给我的住处在你收留我之前还有空？如果我父亲不在乎我们在一起，那我相信 NERV 肯定会为它的两位顶尖驾驶员找到住处！"

"Shinji, I can't just let you..." Misato started, but I continued speaking.

"真嗣，我不能就这样让你……" 美里开口道，但我继续说了下去。

"There is no 'Let' Misato. It you continue to stand in the way of Asuka and I being together, then I shall resign as an Evangelion Pilot effective immediately!"

没有“让”这个选项，Misato。如果你继续阻碍我和 Asuka 在一起，那么我将立即辞去 Evangelion 驾驶员的职务！

"Me too!" Asuka joined. "我也是！" 明日香加入了。

Misato looked darkly back at us. "Are you threatening me? You would endanger the whole World just for your own selfish needs?"

碇真嗣阴沉地回头看着我们。“你在威胁我吗？你们竟为了自己的私欲而置整个世界于危险之中？”

"Why not?" Asuka asked. "Everyone else here seems to do it, why not us?"

"为什么不呢？" 明日香问道，"这里其他人似乎都这么做，为什么我们不行？"

"But you have to understand why I can't let you do this!"

但你必须明白，我不能让你这么做的原因！

"No," I answered. "You have to understand why we are going to do this, not matter what. This is not open for negotiation. You want us to pilot, then we stay together. It's as simple as that."

"不，"我回答道，"你必须明白我们为什么要这么做，无论如何。这一点不容商榷。你想让我们领航，那我们就得在一起。就这么简单。"

Misato buried her head in her hands and said nothing for several minutes. Asuka and I just sat and stared at her, still holding each other tightly. My heart was pounding in my chest, and my stomach was still twisted even more than it had been before. I wasn't proud of what I had said to Misato, but I didn't regret a single word of it.

美里将头埋在双手中，沉默了好几分钟。我和明日香只是坐着，紧盯着她，彼此依然紧紧相拥。我的心在胸腔里狂跳，胃里的纠结比之前更甚。我对自己对美里说的话并不感到自豪，但我对每一个字都不后悔。

Finally she lifted her head up from her hands. Her eyes were red and watery, she looked tired and defeated.

最终，她从双手中抬起头来。她的眼睛红润且含泪，看起来疲惫而颓丧。

"Fine." She said. "Don't expect me to be happy about it, and please don't ever let me actually catch you doing... anything! You can stay here. I give up." She sniffed.

"好吧。" 她说，"别指望我会对此感到高兴，而且拜托千万别让我真的逮到你做……任何事！你可以留在这儿。我放弃了。" 她吸了吸鼻子。

"In the same room." Asuka said.

“在同一个房间。”明日香说道。

It looked like she was about to protest, but then she caved in. "Sure, whatever. It's only my apartment. Why should it matter to me?"

她似乎要抗议，但随即又妥协了。“好吧，随便。这不过是我的公寓，对我来说有什么关系呢？”

"I know that you're pissed off now, Misato." Asuka said in a kind tone. "But understand. Me and Shinji, we love each other. We are happy together. That's what we've been trying to tell you! Try to be happy for us instead of fighting us. We want you to be happy for us too!"

"我知道你现在很生气，美里。"明日香用温和的语气说道，"但请理解，我和真嗣，我们彼此相爱，我们在一起很幸福。这就是我们一直想告诉你的！试着为我们高兴，而不是与我们对抗。我们也希望你能为我们感到高兴！"

"Yeah." I said. "You're like family to us too Misato! We didn't mean to hurt your feelings with this, it was just too difficult to know how to tell you without something like... well something like this happening. Please be happy for us, Misato. Please?"

"嗯。" 我说道，"你对我们来说也像家人一样，美里！我们并不是有意要伤害你的感情，只是不知道该如何告诉你，而不让这样的事情发生……嗯，就像现在这样。请为我们感到高兴吧，美里。可以吗？"

"I-I am happy for you, really. I just... I can't help but feeling that I have failed in my duty as your guardian in allowing this to have happened."

“我...我真的为你高兴，真的。只是...我忍不住觉得，作为你的守护者，我没能阻止这一切发生，是我的失职。”

"Then don't think about this like you're our guardian. Think about this like you're our friend. Can you do that for us?"

那就别把自己当成我们的守护者来考虑这件事，而是像朋友一样来思考。你能为我们做到这一点吗？

"I-I'll try, Shinji. It won't be easy, but I'll try."

我会试试的，真嗣。虽然不容易，但我会努力的。

"Thank you Misato." 谢谢你，美里。

She didn't answer, but just finished draining her Yebisu. I tightened my arm around Asuka who turned and gave me a quick kiss on the lips.

她没有回答，只是默默地喝完了她的惠比寿啤酒。我收紧了环绕着明日香的手臂，她转过身来，迅速在我的唇上轻吻了一下。

"Alright you two." Misato said. "I said that I'd try, but don't push things too far just yet! I'm still struggling with the idea that the two of you are getting more sex than I am!"

"好了，你们两个。" 美里说道，"我是说过会试试，但别太过分了！我还在纠结你们俩的性生活居然比我还丰富！"

Asuka and I both blushed hotly.

明日香和我都脸红了。

"Eeew.. did I actually just say that?" Misato asked with a sickly expression.

"呃……我刚才是不是真的那么说了？" 三佐带着一副难受的表情问道。

We were both still were too busy blushing to answer her.

我们俩都还忙着脸红，没来得及回答她。

"Ach.. I need a shower!" Misato said getting up from the table.

"啊，我得去洗个澡！" 碇真嗣说着，从桌边站起身来。

"I-I'll start dinner." I stammered.

"我、我来准备晚饭。" 我结巴地说。

"I'll help!" Offered Asuka.

"我来帮忙！" 明日香主动提出。

Misato looked back at us from the kitchen doorway. "Wow. You're helping cook dinner Asuka? I think that's probably an even weirder concept than you sleeping with Shinji! My entire World is crumbling around me!" She said melodramatically.

美里从厨房门口回头看向我们，夸张地说：“哇，明日香你居然帮忙做晚饭？我觉得这比跟真嗣一起睡觉还要奇怪！我的整个世界都要崩塌了！”

"Go and have your shower already, Harpy!" Asuka replied.

"快去洗澡吧，哈比！" 明日香回答道。

"Sticks and stones..." "棍棒和石头……"

"Don't tempt me." Asuka replied as Misato disappeared around the doorway.

"别诱惑我。" 明日香回答道，这时美里已经消失在门口拐角处。

I started chopping up the vegetables as Asuka put on the pot to begin preparing the Dashi stock. Despite her alleged disdain for all Japanese cuisine, she could actually whip up a decent variety of Suimono and Nimono if the mood took her. Needless to say that the mood took her fairly infrequently at best.

我开始切蔬菜，而明日香则放上锅准备熬制出汁。尽管她声称对所有日本料理都不屑一顾，但实际上，如果兴致来了，她能做出像样的吸物和煮物。当然，这种兴致是相当难得一见的。

Once the liquid in the pot was heating things became strangely quiet. Before I had time to analyse what this could mean as pair of arms encircled me from behind. I put the knife down and turned around, stealing a kiss from those sweet red lips as I did. Asuka returned in kind.

当锅中的液体开始加热时，周围突然变得异常安静。还没等我来得及分析这意味着什么，一双臂膀从背后环抱住了我。我放下刀，转过身去，顺势偷吻了那甜美的红唇。明日香也以同样的方式回应了我。

"You did well, Third." She said after disengaging from our lip-lock.

"你做得很好，第三。" 她在我们唇吻分开后说道。

"No." I replied. "I let you do most of the talking, I just said what I felt perhaps she would understand and relate to best. I would never have been able to do it without you there."

"不。" 我回答道，"我让你多说，我只是表达了我觉得她可能最能理解和共鸣的内容。没有你在场，我永远做不到这一点。"

"Still." She replied. "That doesn't diminish the act that you stood your ground and defended us. That took some guts Shinji. I'm impressed!"

"还是。" 她回答道，"这并不减少你坚守阵地、保护我们的行为。那需要勇气，真嗣。我很钦佩！"

"I meant every word." I said. "There's no way that I'm ever going to let them separate us! I would give up everything for you Asuka! Everything."

“我说的每一个字都是真心的。” 我说道，“我绝不会让他们把我们分开！为了你，明日香，我可以放弃一切，一切。”

She smiled a precious smile at me. "Me too."

她向我露出了一个珍贵的微笑。“我也是。”

"Even Eva?" I asked.

"连伊娃也这样吗？"我问道。

Her smile faded and a small frown creased her brow. "Baka." She said softly.

她的笑容消失了，眉头微微皱起。“笨蛋。”她轻声说道。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She advanced towards me, still frowning. I quailed internally, but stood up to take whatever punishment she deemed appropriate for my stupidity. She raised both hands to either side of my face and hesitated a moment, her eyes narrowing in thought.

她朝我走来，眉头依旧紧锁。我内心惶恐，但仍站起身来，准备承受她认为对我的愚蠢行为应有的惩罚。她抬起双手，分别放在我的脸颊两侧，犹豫了片刻，眼神微眯，陷入沉思。

"A-Asuka?" I stammered. "飞鸟？" 我结巴着说。

"Baka." She whispered again. The word barely audible even from that close proximity.

"笨蛋。" 她再次低声说道，那声音微弱得即使距离如此之近也几乎听不见。

Her hands clasped my face and I found myself pulled forward into a deep and fervent kiss. Still expecting some kind of retribution for my idiocy I resisted for a couple of seconds, before my brain caught up with proceedings and I relaxed into it. I enclosed her in my arms and held onto Asuka as tightly as I could, feeling the rise and fall of her breasts against my own chest as we continued our embrace.

她的双手捧住我的脸，我发现自己被拉向前，陷入了一个深沉而热烈的吻中。尽管还在担心因自己的愚蠢而受到某种惩罚，我起初抗拒了几秒，直到大脑跟上节奏，我才放松下来。我环抱住她，紧紧地拥抱着明日香，感受着她的胸部随着呼吸起伏贴合在我的胸膛上，我们继续相拥。

Eventually the bubbling of the stock pot as it boiled over caught our attention and we broke off. Before letting me go to attend to it she looked deep into my eyes, her sapphire blue orbs shining intensely at me.

最终，汤锅沸腾溢出的气泡声引起了我们的注意，我们便停了下来。在我去处理之前，她深深地凝视着我的眼睛，她那蓝宝石般的眼眸对我闪烁着强烈的光芒。

"Baka." She said once more. "Does that answer your question?"

"笨蛋。" 她再次说道，"这回答了你的问题吗？"

I nodded back at her. "I'll take that as a yes." I said.

我向她点头回应：“我就当作是同意了。”我说道。

She smiled at me again, seeming to light up the whole room. "Good boy."

她再次向我微笑，仿佛照亮了整个房间。“好孩子。”

By the time Misato came back from her shower dinner was well on its way and life was, for the time being, a good thing to live.

当美里洗完澡回来时，晚餐已经准备得差不多了，而此刻的生活，确实值得好好享受。

I slept poorly that night. Asuka was curled up against me, her arm almost pinning me to the mattress. Her breathing deep and even as she slumbered. I've always envied her ability to fall asleep and stay that way no matter what the situation. Me, I've always needed to toss and turn for at least an hour or more before sleep would ever take me.

那晚我睡得很差。明日香蜷缩在我身边，她的手臂几乎把我固定在床垫上。她熟睡时呼吸深沉而均匀。我一直羡慕她无论在什么情况下都能迅速入睡并保持睡眠的能力。而我，总是需要翻来覆去至少一个小时甚至更久，才能进入梦乡。

This night was even worse. I just stared at the God-Damned ceiling for what felt like hours. No slumber came to me. In fact the only thing that did come to me was a pressing need to go to the bathroom. I carefully squirmed my way out from under Asuka's arm and got out of bed. My beloved muttered unintelligibly in her sleep and rolled over onto her other side. I smiled to myself. 'Success' I thought.

这一夜更是糟糕透顶。我盯着那该死的天花板，仿佛过了好几个小时，却毫无睡意。实际上，唯一涌上心头的，是急迫的如厕需求。我小心翼翼地从明日香的手臂下蠕动出来，下了床。我心爱的人在睡梦中含糊不清地嘟囔着，翻了个身，转向另一侧。我暗自微笑，心想：“成功了。”

After washing and drying my hands I headed back towards our bedroom. That was odd, I thought. There was a pale light emanating from the direction of the lounge room. I crept carefully out into the living area of the apartment. I could see the tousled purple hair of Misato silhouetted against the screen of her NERV issued laptop as she sat on the couch. I looked over her shoulder and felt a pang of sympathy for our guardian as the apparently endless figures and damage estimates from that day's battle marched across the screen.

洗完手并擦干后，我朝我们的卧室走去。这很奇怪，我想。客厅方向透出一丝微弱的光。我小心翼翼地走进公寓的居住区。我能看到美里那凌乱的紫色头发，她的身影映衬在她那台 NERV 发放的笔记本电脑屏幕上，她正坐在沙发上。我越过她的肩膀望去，看到屏幕上不断滚动的数字和当天的战斗损失估计，不禁对我们的监护人产生了一丝同情。

Poor Misato. Aside from the stress of dealing with Asuka and me, she also as Operations Director had the responsibility of overseeing and dealing with the fallout from the battle itself. Hence here she was, sitting in her pyjamas, working into the small hours of the morning on the problems and issues of a World that wanted to be protected from the Angels, but wasn't all that keen on having to deal with the clean up afterwards.

可怜的 Misato。除了应对 Asuka 和我带来的压力，作为作战指挥官，她还肩负着监督并处理战斗后果的责任。因此，她此刻正穿着睡衣，深夜加班处理那些希望被保护免受使徒威胁、却又不太愿意面对善后事宜的世界所面临的问题和难题。

I put a hand on her shoulder. "Misato?"

我把手放在她肩上，“是美里吗？”

"Waaaaah!" Was her only answer as she almost levitated off the couch in surprise. Several hardcopies of battle damage reports slid off the couch and onto the floor. "Shinji! Don't do that!" She said. "You scared ten years growth outta me!"

"哇啊啊啊！" 她惊叫一声，几乎从沙发上飘了起来。几份战斗损伤报告的硬拷贝从沙发上滑落，掉到了地板上。"真嗣！别这样！" 她说道，"你吓得我十年寿命都没了！"

"Sorry Misato." I said sheepishly as I helped to pick up the fallen papers. "I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. Its 2am, you should be in bed!"

"对不起，Misato。" 我一边帮忙捡起散落的文件，一边不好意思地说，"我只是想确认你没事。已经凌晨两点了，你应该去睡觉了！"

"Yeah," She sighed. "But I need to get these reports onto the Sub-Commander's desk by the morning so that he can deal with the City Council, Parks and Wildlife, Citizens against Bio-Mechanical Armament, Tokyo-3 Chamber of Commerce and 27 other National, International and Municipal agencies as to what happened yesterday and why they should have to help foot the bill."

“是啊，”她叹了口气，“但我得在早上之前把这些报告放到副指挥官的桌上，这样他才能处理市议会、公园与野生动物部门、反对生物机械武装的市民团体、东京第三商会以及 27 个其他国家、国际和市政机构，告诉他们昨天发生了什么，以及为什么他们需要分担费用。”

"But shouldn't they just be happy that we saved the World?" I asked.

“但我们不是拯救了世界吗？他们难道不应该为此感到高兴吗？”我问道。

"Well, sure. They want the World to be saved, but... you know... the NIMBY principle is common to almost all of Humanity."

嗯，当然。他们希望世界得到拯救，但是……你知道的……“邻避原则”在人类中几乎普遍存在。

"NIMBY?" "邻避症？"

"Yeah... Not In My Back Yard."

是啊...别在我后院搞事。

"Oh." 哦。

"Yep." She said with another sigh.

"嗯。" 她又叹了口气说道。

She cleared some of the paperwork off the couch and patted the seat next to her invitingly. I sat next to her, a little nervous about what she would say next.

她清理了沙发上的一些文件，并拍了拍旁边的座位，示意我坐下。我坐在她旁边，有点紧张地等待她接下来要说的话。

"So... Shinji." 那么……真嗣。

"Yeah?" I answered. "是吗？"我回答道。

"I... "She paused for a second, seemingly uncertain of how to proceed. "I... um... I want you to know that I'm not angry about what... what happened with you and Asuka."

"我... "她停顿了一下，似乎不确定该如何继续。"我... 呃... 我想让你知道，我对于你和明日香之间发生的事情并不生气。"

I nodded. 我点了点头。

"I'm actually happy that the two of you have found some kind of happiness in this shit-hole of a World. You know what? I kinda envy you."

其实我很高兴你们俩在这个糟糕的世界里找到了某种幸福。你知道吗？我有点羡慕你们。

"You do?" 是吗？

"Yeah. I do. And I respect that stand you took today, you've shown that you can be more of a man than many I could think of. I'm actually quite proud of you for it."

是的，我确实这么认为。我尊重你今天所持的立场，你已经证明了自己比我想象中的许多人更有男子气概。我为此真的感到很骄傲。

"Th-Thank you." I stammered. "I meant all of it."

"谢、谢谢你。" 我结巴地说，"我说的都是真心的。"

"I know." She said. A quiet settled over the room.

"我知道。" 她说。房间里一片静谧。

"But," She continued after a while. "I want you to be careful."

但过了一会儿，她继续说：“我希望你能小心。”

"What do you mean?"

你是什么意思？

"Well, Asuka's a complicated girl. She rubs a lot of people the wrong way. I know that you're strong enough to deal with that. But... The World is cruel. A lot of people might see what you two have and want to destroy it, or even pervert it for their own ends."

嗯，明日香是个复杂的女孩。她让很多人感到不舒服。我知道你有足够的坚强去应对这些。但是……这个世界是残酷的。很多人可能会看到你们俩的关系，并想要摧毁它，甚至为了自己的目的而扭曲它。

"You mean my Father?"

"你是说我的父亲吗？"

She took a deep breath. "Yes... and not only him. There is more going on around NERV at the moment than even I can guess at. I'm just saying, hang on to the good things that you have, they are what will sustain you even when the rest of the World is against you."

她深吸了一口气。“是的……而且不只是他。目前围绕 NERV 发生的事情，甚至超出了我的猜测。我只是想说，抓住你拥有的美好事物，它们将是你即使全世界都与你为敌时也能支撑你的力量。”

"I will, Misato." 我会的，美里。

"I know. And enjoy this time with Asuka. It will be the best of your life, but try to keep under the radar too. I don't want to see either of you get hurt."

我知道。好好享受和明日香在一起的时光吧，这会是你一生中最美好的时光，但也要尽量保持低调。我不想看到你们任何一个人受伤。

"Hurt?" "受伤了吗？"

She smiled warmly at me. "Sorry. I didn't mean to get quite so serious with you. I just want to say that I'm happy for you and Asuka. I'm sorry if I reacted so strongly earlier, it's just my protective instincts kicking in. With the lives that the two of you lead and the things that you have to deal with, you deserve some happiness! You both have my blessing!"

她对我温暖地笑了笑：“抱歉，我并不是有意对你那么严肃。我只是想说，我为你们俩感到高兴。如果我之前的反应过于强烈，我道歉，那只是我的保护欲在作祟。考虑到你们俩的生活和必须面对的事情，你们值得拥有一些幸福！我衷心祝福你们！”

"Thank you Misato, that means a lot to me."

谢谢你，美里，这对我意义重大。

"Me too... But..." 我也是...但是...

"Yes?" "什么事？"

"Please don't ever let me catch either of you two... erm... you know... doing... um... "

请千万别让我逮到你们俩中的任何一个……呃……你们知道的……做……嗯……

I hoped that she couldn't see my blush in the dim light in the room.

我希望在房间昏暗的光线下，她看不到我脸红。

"Just... be discreet I guess I'm trying to say!" She finished.

“就是……我想说的是，要谨慎行事！”她结束了谈话。

"Yes Misato." "好的，美里。"

"Alright, now get back to bed young Shinji!" She said.

"好了，现在快回床上去吧，年轻的真嗣！" 她说道。

"Yes Ma'am! And Misato."

是的，女士！还有，美里。

"Yes?" "什么事？"

"I love you." 我爱你。

Her smile glowed even brighter than the computer screen. "Thank you. I love you too Shinji!" And I found myself enveloped in the arms of Misato Katsuragi, her heady scent of lavender and stale lager swamping my senses.

她的笑容比电脑屏幕还要明亮：“谢谢你，我也爱你，真嗣！”我发现自己被葛城美里紧紧拥抱着，她那薰衣草与陈年啤酒混合的醉人香气淹没了我的感官。

I can still, even now, close my eyes and see her framed in the pale glow of the laptop, head buried back in her figures and reports, hair awry as it cascaded over her pyjama clad shoulders.

即便此刻，我仍能闭上双眼，看见她被笔记本电脑的微弱光芒所环绕，头埋在数字和报告之中，头发凌乱地垂落在她穿着睡衣的肩上。

I have always felt unworthy of the life that she gave me.

我始终觉得自己配不上她给予我的生活。

Asuka was awake when i returned to bed.

当我回到床上时，明日香已经醒了。

"Where were you?" She asked groggily.

"你在哪儿？" 她昏昏沉沉地问道。

"I had to go to the bathroom." I answered. "Misato was up, so I talked to her for a while."

我回答说：“我得去趟洗手间。那时美里醒着，我就和她聊了一会儿。”

"That explains the perfume." She said. "Well, what did she have to say? Was it more lectures on the evils of sex?"

“这就解释了那香水味。”她说，“那么，她说了些什么？又是关于性之恶的那些说教吗？”

"No. She's happy for us. I think that she's still a bit uncomfortable with us sleeping together, but she really wants us to be happy!"

"不，她为我们感到高兴。我觉得她对我们同床共枕还是有点不自在，但她真心希望我们幸福！"

"Well, Hip-Hip-Hoo-fucking-ray!" She said. "Thank God she sees sense at last!"

“哎呀，万岁万岁他妈的万万岁！”她说道，“谢天谢地，她总算明白过来了！”

"She's a good person."

她是个好人。

"I know." Asuka said, yawning. "Now then you! Less talking and more snuggling!"

"我知道了。" 明日香说着，打了个哈欠。"现在轮到你了！少说点话，多抱抱我！"

"As you wish." 如您所愿。

"Baka." 笨蛋。

As usual, within seconds she was back to sleep, her arms wrapped around me and her body tight against my own. I took a little longer, of course. I got to thinking.

像往常一样，几秒钟内她又睡着了，双臂环抱着我，身体紧紧贴着我的。当然，我花的时间稍长一些。我开始思考起来。

For the last few weeks I had been focussed almost completely on the blossoming relationship with Asuka. The beautiful, volatile and incredibly delicate girl that had caught hold of my heart in a vise-like grip.

在过去的几周里，我几乎完全专注于与明日香这段正在绽放的关系。这位美丽、易变且极其脆弱的女孩，以一种钳制般的力量紧紧抓住了我的心。

Now that happiness had found me after being missing in action for most of my life, what did that mean for the future? My future, the World's future? Now facing that uncertain future together, what would we change? What would be unable to change? What would this mean for our other relationships with our friends, colleagues and superiors?

如今，幸福在生命的大部分时光中销声匿迹后终于找到了我，这对未来意味着什么？我的未来，世界的未来？现在我们共同面对那个不确定的未来，我们将改变什么？又有哪些是无法改变的？这对我们与朋友、同事及上级的其他关系又意味着什么？

I dismissed these thoughts as pointless and unanswerable.

我将这些念头视为无意义且无法解答的。

End of Chapter 9 第九章结束

A/N: This actually concludes Neon Genesis Evangelion: Propinquity. My original plan was never to take the story right to the end of the Evangelion story, just to show Shinji and Asuka growing together and learning to love each other. But, I must admit that I do have quite a bit more plot in mind now that the die is cast and they're officially outed as a couple.

作者注：这实际上是《新世纪福音战士：近缘》的完结。我最初的计划从未打算将故事一直延续到《新世纪福音战士》的结尾，只是想展示真嗣和明日香如何共同成长并学会彼此相爱。但必须承认，现在既然他们已正式公开恋情，我脑海中确实涌现出了更多剧情。

If people seem to like what I've done... Then I'll have a crack at writing the next arc! So let me know if you think its worth continuing!

如果大家似乎喜欢我所做的...那我就会尝试写下一个篇章！所以，请告诉我你们是否认为值得继续下去！

So my plan would be to do a sequel as a new story. I kinda feel that the new story arc would be better served by having the space of its own story rather than just being tacked onto this one. So that is what is in the works.

因此，我的计划是做一个续集，作为全新的故事。我有点觉得这个新故事线更适合拥有自己的独立空间，而不是仅仅附加在这个故事上。这就是我们正在筹备的内容。

It will be called. Neon Genesis Evangelion: Who Breaks a Butterfly on the Wheel? and will be a chapter by chapter release. I will be writing an epilogue to this story to join it more fully to the new one, so if you're interested in it, watch for that as the signal in the story alerts that the new story is up!

它将被命名为《新世纪福音战士：谁以轮碾蝶？》，并按章节发布。我将为此故事撰写一个尾声，以便更紧密地连接到新故事，所以如果你对此感兴趣，请留意故事中的信号，它将提示新故事已上线！

I hope that you've enjoyed this and please leave a review!

希望您喜欢这个内容，请留下您的评价！

Thanks. 谢谢。

## Epilogue

Nothing's gonna change my world…

没有什么能改变我的世界……

So… there it is… You think that maybe we'd got our happy ending then?

那么……就是这样了……你认为我们那时可能已经得到了幸福的结局吗？

The way I've heard it told you'd be forgiven for thinking that I, a pale and awkwardly shy guy who grew up in loveless household on the outskirts of Odawara, arrived in Tokyo-03 and in short order: single-handedly defied my father, piloted the giant robot, won the heart of the fiery redheaded maiden and, as a side note, saved the world while I was at it.

据我所闻，你可能会以为我这个在热海郊外一个缺乏爱的家庭长大的苍白而害羞的家伙，一到东京 03 区就迅速地：单枪匹马反抗了父亲，驾驶巨型机器人，赢得了那位火红头发的烈性女子的芳心，顺带一提，还拯救了世界。

Wow… that was simple… wasn't it?

哇… 就这么简单… 不是吗？

Hmmm… Sure, it does make a pretty good story, and some parts of it are even true… Other parts… Yeah… Well I guess that it just goes to show you that you shouldn't believe everything that you read on the internet.

嗯……当然，这确实是个挺精彩的故事，其中有些部分甚至是真的……其他部分嘛……呃……我想这正好说明你不应该相信你在网上读到的一切。

Asuka… Asuka made me happier and more terrified on a daily basis than you could possibly imagine.

明日香……明日香让我每天既感到无比幸福又极度恐惧，这种感受你可能难以想象。

Or maybe you can. 或许你也能做到。

It felt as though with her a hollowness at the very centre of my being that I wasn't even aware of was finally gone. At the same time, I kept waiting in terror for her to come to her senses and realise what a terrible mistake she had made in being with me.

感觉就像，与她在一起时，我内心深处未曾察觉的空虚终于消失了。与此同时，我又在恐惧中等待着，生怕她突然醒悟，意识到与我在一起是个多么可怕的错误。

I only ever dared to express that fear to her once… let's just say that she felt that I was being foolish to think such a thing and we'll not mention the yelling and the gesticulating and the door slamming that followed that little confession.

我只有一次鼓起勇气向她表达了那种恐惧……这么说吧，她觉得我这么想太愚蠢了，至于随后的吼叫、手势和摔门，我们就不提了。

Ahem… That aside, without her beside me I can't even begin to imagine how things would have gone back then. Those last few months in Tokyo-03 really gave clusterfuck a bad name.

呃……撇开那件事不谈，没有她在身边，我简直无法想象当时的情况会如何。东京 03 区最后那几个月，真是让“一团糟”这个词都显得逊色。

Really all I was initially worried about was how my friends would take the news of Asuka and me being in a relationship, and how Asuka would take to my friends… hopefully not with a blunt instrument. Like perhaps a flügelhorn …

起初我真正担心的只是我的朋友们会如何接受我和明日香在一起的消息，以及明日香会如何与我的朋友们相处……希望不会是用钝器。比如，也许是一把富鲁格号……

Heh… Don't try to be funny Shinji…

呵呵……别试图搞笑了，真嗣……

Anyway… none of that was anywhere near as difficult as I had feared. Toji and Kensuke were… concerned for my wellbeing, let's say. When Asuka and I turned up back at school together hand in hand and both blushing awkwardly the gasps and yells and even screams that we faced were hugely embarrassing, but we just rode it through and clasped our hands even tighter. Thank god for Hikari, she made sure that things were kept civil fairly quickly.

无论如何……这些都没有我预想的那么困难。东治和健介对我的安危表示了关切。当明日香和我手牵手、面带尴尬的红晕一起回到学校时，我们面对的惊呼、尖叫甚至惨叫声极为尴尬，但我们只是坚持下去，紧握彼此的手。感谢光，她很快确保了场面保持文明。

Life was good. Well as good as it can be with the ever-present threat of genocidal-explodey-death stomping down the valley every fortnight or so.

生活还算不错。尽管每两周左右就有灭绝性的爆炸死亡威胁从山谷中袭来，但生活还是尽可能地好。

Ignorance is, or was, bliss. We thought back then that the Angels were the only horrors that we had to worry about.

无知曾经是福。我们那时以为天使是我们唯一需要担心的恐怖。

How I wish that was the case.

我多么希望情况真是那样。

The loss of ignorance and the true end of innocence came from a direction that none of us had ever anticipated.

无知之失与纯真之终，其来之方向，皆非我等所预见。

End of Neon Genesis Evangelion: Propinquity

新世纪福音战士终章：近亲之缘

So here, after many years, is the epilogue to Propinquity. Its tone is more reflective than the previous chapter as I feel that Shinji, in Propinquity, was concentrating on the growth of the relationship that he and Asuka were just embarking on. Now he's looking forward from that to the bigger picture and what that meant to himself, Asuka and those that they cared about.

多年之后，这里终于迎来了《近在咫尺》的尾声。相较于前一章，本章的语气更显沉思，因为我感觉在《近在咫尺》中，真嗣专注于他与明日香刚刚起步的关系成长。如今，他从那一点展望更广阔的图景，思考这对他、明日香以及他们所关心的人意味着什么。

It also serves as a primer for the sequel...

它还作为续集的入门介绍...

Echoes of Light and Water

光与水的回响

A life with light but no purpose is one I find difficult to acclimatise myself to.

有光而无目的的生活，我发现自己难以适应。

This, I feel, is not ingratitude. Nor do I wish for anything other. Perhaps I am merely unused to living…

这并非忘恩负义，我也不求其他。或许我只是不习惯生活……

The Second Child… Asuka, as she would have me address her, finds my feelings on this matter an offense to her highly developed sense of rightness. I, for myself, cannot argue that she is wrong. Though I do attempt to explain as best as I can that I hold no misplaced nostalgia for NERV nor indeed for things as they once were.

第二适格者……明日香，她希望我这样称呼她，认为我对这件事的感受是对她高度发达的正义感的冒犯。我自己也无法反驳她错了。尽管我尽力解释，我并没有对 NERV 或过去的事物抱有不恰当的怀旧之情。

But… I was created for a purpose. I was a tool, a commodity… a doll, if you will. What is the meaning of existence for a tool that no longer has a use? What purpose does the hammer serve if the nail is lost? It troubles me still, even if Asuka does roll her eyes and groan to the heavens on the rare occasions that I would bring the subject up.

但是……我被创造出来是有目的的。我是一件工具，一种商品……可以说是一个玩偶。对于一个不再有用的工具来说，存在的意义是什么？如果钉子丢失了，锤子还有什么用处？这仍然困扰着我，即使明日香偶尔会翻白眼并对着天空叹气，当我提起这个话题时。

Shinji, naturally, is more sympathetic. He better understands, perhaps, my difficulty with self-expression. I truly do feel myself fortunate for the freedom that my life affords me, but when a bird has only known the confines of its cage, should it not also view the expanse of the unbounded firmament with apprehension and distrust?

真嗣自然更富有同情心。他或许更能理解我在自我表达上的困难。我确实感到自己因生活给予的自由而幸运，但一只只知笼中生活的鸟儿，面对无垠天空的广阔，难道不应该也感到恐惧和怀疑吗？

But again my communication skills fall short of my intentions. In this world, difficult and strife-torn as it is, I have truly known happiness. An emotion once so foreign to me and yet so powerful that my first experiences of it left me breathless and overwhelmed. That such an emotion should exist, and be experienced by… one such as myself… is something of an astonishment to me even still.

然而，我的沟通能力再次未能达到我的意图。在这个充满困难和纷争的世界里，我确实体验过幸福。这种曾对我如此陌生却又强大的情感，初次体验时让我屏息和不知所措。这种情感的存在，以及像我这样的人也能体验到它，至今仍让我感到惊讶。

For it was not always so.

因为情况并非总是如此。

Truly I once did know purpose. And with it I also knew darkness.

的确，我曾深知何为目的。与之相伴的，还有我对黑暗的认知。

My life was one of use. I had use, therefore I existed. I filled a need, albeit as a surrogate for another, so I yielded myself to the touch of a monster.

我的生活曾充满用途。我有用，故我存在。我填补了一个需求，尽管是作为他人的替代品，因此我将自己奉献给了怪物的触碰。

That which I had been conditioned to hold the most dear was also that which held my heart in bonds of iron that had weighed me down for so long I mistook them for the embrace of a father.

我被灌输得最为珍视的东西，也正是那用铁链束缚我心灵，让我长久以来误以为是父亲拥抱的重负。

Even to this day I can feel the stain on my soul which that embrace has left behind.

即便到了今天，我仍能感受到那个拥抱在我灵魂上留下的污点。

It haunts me still, even though I, a transgression against Humanity, have found redemption in the simple kindness of those I would now call my family.

它依旧萦绕着我，尽管我，这个对人性犯下罪行的人，已经在那些我如今称之为家人的人的简单善意中找到了救赎。

Family… A concept that I still struggle to understand. I suppose that is still a part of my journey. A journey that began with an act of unlooked-for kindness to a small and broken tool, lost in the darkness.

家庭……一个我至今仍难以理解的概念。我想这仍是我的旅程的一部分。这段旅程始于对一件小而破损的工具在黑暗中意外施予的善意。

That is my story. Though I am not the one to tell it.

这就是我的故事。尽管我不是讲述它的人。
