### Chapter 1
"Though we feel let down  
尽管我们感到失望  
By the same old autumn breathing  
随着那熟悉的秋日气息  
Winter's curse is just around the bend."  
冬日的诅咒即将来临。

There's a party inside the bar, but we're out in the alley, squaring off like we're about to have a fist fight. Her cold blue eyes are boring into mine and her jaw is clenched like a bear trap. I can see her weighing her words, which isn't a common thing for Asuka to do. This must be important.  
酒吧里正举行派对，但我们却在巷子里对峙，仿佛即将展开一场拳斗。她冰蓝色的眼睛直勾勾地盯着我，下颚紧绷如同捕熊夹。我能看出她在斟酌言辞，这对明日香来说并不常见。这一定很重要。

She looks off to the side, and ashes her cigarette on the ground next to her. She lifts it up to her lips and is about to take another drag when she begins to speak instead.  
她侧目望向一旁，将烟灰弹落在脚边。她将烟举至唇边，正欲再吸一口时，却开口说话了。

"You know I'm not someone who… talks about these things a lot. I don't have a battle plan for this. It might be sloppy." She shakes her head and lets the flame drop out of her hands. She crushes it underneath her foot and fixes me in her gaze again.  
“你知道我不是那种……经常谈论这些事的人。我没有应对计划，可能会显得很乱。”她摇了摇头，任由手中的火光熄灭。她用脚碾灭烟头，再次凝视着我。

"I like… this. I like _us_. I like what we've found here," she gestures around. "Things have been rough lately, you know that. Jesus Christ you're pretty much the only person I can talk to about it. Those assholes in there are just…" she trails off looking for words.  
"我喜欢……这个。我喜欢我们。我喜欢我们在这里找到的东西，"她挥手示意周围。"最近事情很艰难，你知道的。天哪，你几乎是我唯一能谈论这些的人。那些混蛋在里面只是……"她停下来寻找合适的词。

"Friends?" I offer. She snorts.  
"朋友？"我提议。她嗤之以鼻。

"Barely. _Some_ maybe." She takes out another cigarette and moves to light it.  
"勉强算吧。可能有几个。"她又拿出一支烟，准备点燃。

"Asuk-"

"Fuck off, Ikari. They're my lungs, I can do what I want with 'em." She inhales again, and dies a little more.  
"滚开，碇。这是我的肺，我爱怎么折腾就怎么折腾。" 她又吸了一口，生命又消逝了一点点。

I had a conversation with Asuka when she started smoking, about how it worried me and the like, but there was no convincing her. Once the Eva battles ended, Asuka took it the worst. It was her identity, and sure we'd saved the world, but she'd rendered herself victoriously obsolete. Honestly, all things considered, she could be doing much worse things to her body than smoking. Heroin, I guess. Any number of other stupid things.  
当 Asuka 开始抽烟时，我和她谈过，表达了我的担忧之类的话，但无法说服她。Eva 战斗结束后，Asuka 受到的打击最大。那是她的身份，虽然我们拯救了世界，但她却让自己成为了胜利后的多余者。说实话，考虑到所有情况，她对自己身体的伤害比起抽烟来说，可能还有更糟糕的事情。比如海洛因，或者其他一些愚蠢的行为。

It's not like I could stop her.  
我可阻止不了她。

_A memory_: 一段记忆：

"I'll die from this," she said, holding a pack up of red Gauloises for me to see. "I know you probably don't understand, but I like knowing that."  
“我会因此丧命的，”她举起一包红色高卢烟让我看，说道，“我知道你可能不懂，但我喜欢这种认知。”

"Why?" I had asked. "为什么？" 我问道。

Click. Light. Drag. "Because it's my choice."  
点击。亮光。拖动。"因为这是我的选择。"

_Now_:

"But they're not real friends, Shinji. None of them lived through what we did. No one understands, really. I don't… I don't know if they _could_." She studies the ground. The crushed tobacco under her feet.  
"但他们不是真正的朋友，真嗣。他们没有人经历过我们所经历的。没有人真正理解，我真的……我不知道他们是否能够理解。" 她凝视着地面。脚下的碾碎的烟草。

Inside the bar, someone spills something and there's a massive uproar of laughter. It might be a fight, I can't really tell.  
酒吧里，有人洒了东西，随即爆发出一阵哄堂大笑。可能是打起来了，我也说不准。

I sigh, "Look, if you don't want me here-"  
我叹了口气，"听着，如果你不希望我在这儿——"

"That's not what I'm saying, just… let me talk, for a second." She's groping for words again. Saying what she feels is rarely a problem with the Teutonic fury in front of me, but she's using the German part of her brain. She's picking words like clockwork, making sure they're in their places before unleashing them.  
"我不是那个意思，只是……让我说几句。" 她又在寻找合适的词了。表达情感对她面前这位日耳曼式的怒火来说从来不是问题，但她现在用的是德语思维。她像钟表一样精心挑选词汇，确保它们各就各位后才释放出来。

'You have to think like that, with German,' she told me once. 'It's harder to be stream of consciousness. English and Japanese flow more like water, but with German each word is a cog, and if you miss one, the whole meaning falls apart.' It had something to do with the way the sentences were made and verb conjugation. I didn't really understand it at the time, but the older and less impulsive Asuka's gotten the more I've seen that German side come out in her.  
‘你必须这样思考，用德语，’她曾告诉我，‘德语更难做到意识流。英语和日语像水一样流畅，但德语每个词都是齿轮，一旦漏掉一个，整个意思就支离破碎。’这和句子的构造及动词变位有关。我当时并不真正理解，但随着明日香越来越成熟、冲动减少，我越来越多地看到她身上显露出这种德语特质。

She lines her cogs up and speaks:  
她排列好她的齿轮，然后开口：

"I need you, Shinji." My first name drops like an atomic bomb. No honorific after it emasculating me, and not the more common 'Ikari'. I don't remember the last time I was just 'Shinji'.  
“我需要你，真嗣。”我的名字像一颗原子弹般落下。没有削弱我男子气概的敬语，也不是更常见的‘碇’。我不记得上次我只是‘真嗣’是什么时候了。

She continues: "I need you to be near me and to help me with this mess."  
她继续说道：“我需要你在我身边，帮我处理这个烂摊子。”

"You mean the thing with your father?"  
“你是说和你父亲的那件事？”

"Yes! That, college, these people, all of it. Nobody gets me like you do. You've seen me at rock bottom and you're still here and I need that… probably more than I even know I do," she smiles ruefully. "I'm too smart to think I always know exactly what's going on in my head, so."  
“对！那个，还有大学，这些人，所有的一切。没有人像你这样理解我。你见过我最糟糕的样子，却依然在这里，我需要这个……可能比我意识到的还要多，”她苦笑着说，“我太聪明了，不会以为自己总是清楚脑袋里在想什么，所以。”

"So what?" "那又怎样？"

"So problem is this," she holds up a finger. "We know what we are as friends. We're closer than we've ever been, and yes," I think she's blushing, but it's hard to see in the lower light. "On some level I'm certainly..." she mumbles something, but in the din I can't hear it. _She lacks tape reviews?_  
"问题就在这儿，" 她竖起一根手指。"我们知道作为朋友我们是什么样的。我们比以往任何时候都要亲近，是的，" 我想她脸红了，但在较暗的光线下很难看清。"在某种程度上，我当然……" 她咕哝了些什么，但在嘈杂声中我听不清楚。她缺少磁带评论吗？

"…on some level you're _what_?"  
"……在某种程度上你是什么？"

"Oh come on!" She tosses up her hands, sending ash everywhere. I watch her turn towards the brick wall behind herself and gently tap her head against it.  
"哎呀，真是的！" 她双手一挥，灰烬四散。我看着她转向身后的砖墙，轻轻地用头敲打墙面。

"I couldn't hear, Asuka! The bar is-"  
"我听不见，明日香！酒吧里太吵了——"

"I'm _attracted_ to you, okay?! I like you! I find you attractive! Jesus, Ikari, what are you, _stupid_?!" She's certainly blushing now, and I feel my face heat up as well. "Why do you think we spend so much time together?! Why do you think I choose you to study with?! We're rooming together for Christ's sake, do you think it's because you're such a good cook?! I can order food if I need it, it's your company I _want_!" Asuka stands, hands at her sides, face red from screaming. She looks away, deeply embarrassed. I think she said more than she meant to.  
"我对你有感觉，行了吧？！我喜欢你！我觉得你很有吸引力！天哪，碇真嗣，你是不是傻？!" 她现在肯定脸红了，我也感到自己的脸在发热。"你以为我们为什么总在一起？！你以为我为什么选你一起学习？！我们同住一间房，你以为是因为你厨艺好？！我需要的话可以点外卖，我想要的是你的陪伴！" 明日香站起身，双手垂在两侧，因大喊大叫而满脸通红。她别过头去，显得非常尴尬。我想她说的话比她原本打算的要多。

"You just wanted to hear me say it twice, you perv." She mutters to herself, barely audible from where I'm standing. I can't help but smile at it.  
"你只是想听我说两遍，你这个变态。" 她喃喃自语，声音低得我几乎听不见。我不禁对此微笑。

I look down at the ground, shoving my hands in my pockets. Unbidden, I think of the first time we kissed, all those eons ago.  
我低头看着地面，把手插进口袋。不由自主地，我想起了我们第一次接吻，那仿佛是亿万年前的事了。

"Asuka, I… I like you too, you know?"  
"明日香，我……我也喜欢你，你知道的？"

"Yeah," she says, quietly turning a deeper shade of red. "Yeah, I know."  
"嗯，" 她轻声说道，脸颊泛起了更深的红晕。"嗯，我知道。"

I shift my weight and I force myself to look back up at her face.  
我挪了挪重心，强迫自己再次抬头看向她的脸。

"Well, maybe we could give it a shot then?" I say, trying to keep excitement out of my voice. She leans against the bricks with a sigh.  
"那么，也许我们可以试试看？" 我尽量不让声音流露出兴奋。她叹了口气，靠在了砖墙上。

"We really shouldn't." "我们真的不应该。"

"Why not?" I spread my arms, "If we both want to, then why would we ever not? What's holding us back?!"  
"为什么不呢？" 我张开双臂，"如果我们双方都愿意，那为什么我们还要犹豫？是什么在阻止我们？！"

"Because what happens if it doesn't work, huh?!" She there's fire in her eyes, and all of a sudden I'm fourteen again and falling in love with a girl who hates me. "It _changes_ things, Shinji! And I don't want them to change… I can't have them change, not when we've finally found what we're supposed to always have been."  
"因为如果它行不通怎么办，嗯？！" 她眼中闪烁着怒火，突然间我又回到了十四岁，爱上了一个恨我的女孩。"它会改变一切，真嗣！我不想让事情改变……我不能让它们改变，尤其是在我们终于找到了我们一直应该拥有的东西之后。"

"Which is what?" “什么东西？”

"This! Us! Talking! Saying things we actually mean and not some passive-aggressive fourteen-year-old bullshit!" She's screaming now. I'm happy for the ruckus of the bar, for once. "People in relationships lie! They end up wanting things that aren't there, and they get bored and they fuck other people, and I'm not gonna have that happen, Ikari! Not to you and not to me!"  
“就是这个！我们！在交谈！说出我们真正的心意，而不是那些十四岁小孩的被动攻击性屁话！”她现在尖叫着。我很庆幸酒吧的喧闹声，至少这次是。“恋爱中的人会撒谎！他们最终会想要那些并不存在的东西，他们会感到厌倦，然后和别人上床，我可不想让这种事发生，碇！不是对你，也不是对我！”

She looks away, relighting her nearly forgotten cigarette. Inside, I see Touji waving to see if everything's okay, and I wave him an 'okay' as convincingly as possible. No one needs to know this is happening. The last thing I want right now is an audience.  
她转过头去，重新点燃那支几乎被遗忘的香烟。我看到里面的冬二在挥手，想确认一切是否还好，我尽可能装作自然地向他回了一个“没事”的手势。没人需要知道这一切正在发生。我现在最不希望的就是有观众在场。

"So what," I ask, throat dry. "we're not even going to try?"  
"那又怎样，" 我问，喉咙发干。"我们甚至不打算尝试一下吗？"

"No, we're not." There's a note of finality in her voice that crushes something inside of me.  
"不，我们不会。" 她的声音里有一种决绝的意味，让我内心某处被压垮了。

"That's… pretty damn cynical, Asuka." She laughs.  
"那真是……相当悲观啊，明日香。" 她笑了。

"Yeah, well. You're the one attracted to it." Her eyes are mocking. She's shoving me away again, trying to kill the mood as much as possible, and I hate her for it. You self-destructive jerk. Cigarettes and booze and crushing your own happiness before it starts. Something boils up inside me.  
"是啊，反正。被它吸引的是你。" 她的眼神带着嘲弄。她又在推开我，试图尽可能地破坏气氛，我恨她这一点。你这个自我毁灭的混蛋。香烟、酒精，还有在幸福开始之前就将其碾碎。某种情绪在我内心沸腾起来。

"You're pathetic, you know that?"  
"你真可悲，知道吗？"

Anger flares in her eyes, and she tosses her cigarette at my face. It flies over my shoulder harmlessly, but I felt the heat as it traveled past my ear.  
她眼中怒火中烧，将手中的香烟朝我脸上扔来。烟头从我肩头无害地飞过，但我能感觉到它掠过耳边时的热度。

"Get off it, Ikari. I bet you just wanted to fuck."  
"得了吧，碇。我打赌你只是想上床。"

She starts to head back towards the bar.  
她开始朝吧台走回去。

"Oh, so did you," I mutter, and for a moment, she stops in her tracks. Her back is to me, the doorknob is in her hands, and she's standing there like a statue.  
"哦，你也是吧，"我低声说，有那么一会儿，她停下了脚步。她的背对着我，手中握着门把手，像一尊雕像一样站在那里。

I think she's trying to come up with a retort – a final word she can snap back and 'win' the conversation with – but she's too busy thinking again. Finally she looks at me, and she's smiling again, but it's a sad smile this time. There's regret everywhere in it.  
我想她在试图想出一个反驳的话——一个她可以甩回来并‘赢得’这场对话的最后一句——但她现在又陷入了思考。最终她看向我，再次微笑，但这次是苦笑。其中充满了遗憾。

"Oh come on, Shinji," another atom bomb, straight to my heart. "I think we both know that's not true."  
“哦，别这样，真嗣，”又一颗原子弹，直击我的心。“我想我们都知道那不是真的。”

And then I realize she's thought about it as much as I have. She's stayed up at night and wondered how it would feel to consummate our friendship, if it would be angry, or cathartic, or even… sweet? Would we 'make love'? She's wondered how I taste, as I have with her. She's said those three words to herself with my name at the end, just to try them out.  
然后我意识到她和我一样深思熟虑过。她彻夜未眠，想知道将我们的友谊升华会是什么感觉，是愤怒，还是宣泄，甚至……甜蜜？我们会‘做爱’吗？她想知道我的味道，就像我想知道她的味道一样。她曾对着自己说出那三个字，以我的名字结尾，只是为了尝试一下。

Suddenly I'm not angry anymore, and neither is she.  
突然间，我不再生气了，她也是。

Asuka steps forward, and takes me in an embrace. She nuzzles into my chest and squeezes a little too tight. It almost feels desperate.  
明日香走上前，紧紧地抱住了我。她把头埋在我的胸口，抱得有点太紧了。几乎让人感觉到了一丝绝望。

I kiss the top of her head, long bereft of sync clips, and I breathe in her scent. It's a little smoky now, but I love it. I've come to associate the smell with her, which frightens me a little. We're both changing, and there's nothing we can do about it except hold on.  
我亲吻了她头顶那早已没有同步夹的地方，深深地吸了一口她的气息。现在这味道有点烟熏感，但我很喜欢。我已经将这种气味与她联系在一起，这让我有些害怕。我们都在改变，除了紧紧抓住彼此，别无他法。

"We would be a great couple, Asuka." I mention, feeling her against me: the tight grip of her arms and the gentle push of her breasts into my torso. Even through her coat I feel her warmth like fire.  
"我们会是很好的一对，明日香。" 我说道，感受着她的贴近：她手臂的紧握和胸部轻柔地压在我的胸膛上。即使隔着她的外套，我也能感受到她如火般的温暖。

She leans back and looks up. "You know, we probably could," she giggles. Asuka giggling. What a night of firsts this has been. I place my hand around her waist.  
她向后仰头，抬头看着我。"你知道吗，我们或许真的可以，" 她咯咯笑着。明日香在笑。今晚真是充满了第一次。我将手环在她的腰间。

"But we won't?" "但我们不会？"

She shakes her head decisively.  
她果断地摇了摇头。

"Not a chance, Baka-Shinji," and for once, it sounds like a pet name instead of an insult. It sounds like something a lover would call me.  
“没门，笨蛋真嗣，”这一次，听起来像是一个昵称而非侮辱。听起来像是恋人会叫我的那种称呼。

"So what are we then?"  
“那我们算什么呢？”

"We're us. Like we always have been," she's smiling now, her fingers lace through mine and lead me towards the doorway. "Because you know what happens to couples that will never happen to us?"  
"我们就是我们，一如既往，" 她现在微笑着，手指穿过我的指间，牵着我向门口走去。"因为你知道那些情侣会发生而我们绝不会发生的事吗？"

"No, what?" "不知道，是什么？"

"They end." "他们结束了。"

_AN: I don't know what exactly this is, but it was interesting enough to upload.  
作者注：我不太确定这到底是什么，但它足够有趣，值得上传。_

_On a related note, if you never discovered Motion City Soundtrack's album "Commit This to Memory" in high school, find it now and etch it into your heart. All my worst memories have that cathartic beauty under them. Well, that and "Pinkerton" by Weezer, but you should really have that one already.  
顺便一提，如果你在高中时从未发现过 Motion City Soundtrack 乐队的专辑《Commit This to Memory》，现在就去找来，让它深深烙印在你的心中。我所有最糟糕的记忆之下，都有着那种净化心灵的美。哦，还有 Weezer 乐队的《Pinkerton》，不过你应该已经拥有那张专辑了。_

_This will probably continue, but I'm so shitty at making updates that I won't lead you on by promising you that. I'm really sorry about being awful.  
这可能会继续，但我更新实在太糟糕了，所以不会承诺什么来误导你。真的很抱歉，我太差劲了。_

_And self-pity. Haha! Enjoy guys.  
还有自怜。哈哈！大家享受吧。_

"But all I can do is close my eyes,  
但我唯一能做的就是闭上双眼，  
And cross my heart, 并且我发誓，  
And hope to die." 希望就此死去。

I'm six beers in when I realize I'll be waking up with a hangover, but I'm already reaching for the seventh.  
当我喝了六瓶啤酒时，我意识到醒来时会有宿醉，但我已经伸手去拿第七瓶了。

I'm trying to hydrate, you know? I've been chugging water in between the ubiquitous booze, but there's only so much a liver can handle before it sends it straight to your head. I already bashed my shin in on something earlier, and I think it might be bleeding again. Alcohol lowers the coagulation in your blood, right?  
我正努力补水呢，你知道吗？我在那些无处不在的酒精之间猛灌水，但肝脏的承受能力也是有限的，一旦超负荷，它就直接冲上你的头。我之前已经撞伤了小腿，感觉可能又在流血了。酒精会降低血液凝固能力，对吧？

Right. That's a thing. Anemia and Mephistopheles and a million other things that I've blessedly forgotten. A moment of quiet, all to myself, brought to me by Sapporo. I crave quiet. I overthink things too much. I've been trying to stop, but everytime I do I just get caught in another rabbit hole. Bad decisions leading to bad ends, with no way out. At least when I was piloting I had a purpose. Now I'm just getting drunk alone in my apartment, because I know Shinji won't be home until late. There's a pleasant warmth that comes from a buzz. It feels like being in someone's arms, even when you're throwing up in the gutter.  
对，确实如此。贫血、墨菲斯托菲里斯还有其他无数我已经幸运地忘记的事情。这一刻的宁静，是札幌啤酒带给我的。我渴望安静。我太爱多想了。我一直在努力停止，但每次都陷入另一个兔子洞。糟糕的决定导致糟糕的结局，无路可逃。至少当我驾驶 EVA 时还有个目标。现在我只是独自在公寓里喝醉，因为我知道真嗣要很晚才会回家。微醺带来一种愉悦的温暖。感觉就像被人拥抱着，即使你正吐在路边。

I stumble onto the porch of our apartment and drop my cigarettes before I can light one. I laugh at my clumsiness, and pick them up to light up and feel the rush of nicotine into my blood. Drinking always makes me want to smoke. It also makes smoking feel better, so go figure. I'm no fucking fool.  
我踉跄地走到公寓的门廊，还没来得及点烟就掉了几根。我为自己的笨拙笑出声，捡起烟点上，感受尼古丁涌入血液的快感。喝酒总让我想抽烟。它还让抽烟感觉更好，真是难以理解。我可不是什么傻瓜。

I have to import these goddamn things. Japanese cigarettes just make me want to vomit, they're so thick with cheap tobacco. Don't even get me started on the fucking Chinese ones. And sure, Gauloises are _French_, but they're all over Germany. I remember walking into my first shop in Frankfurt and throwing my head back, proud:  
我得进口这些该死的东西。日本的烟太浓了，劣质烟草味重得让人想吐。更别提那些该死的中国烟了。当然，高卢烟是法国的，但德国到处都是。我记得第一次走进法兰克福的商店时，自豪地仰头说：

"Die Gauloises, bitte." “请给我高卢烟。”

"Ja, natürlich. Rot oder blau?"  
"是的，当然。红色还是蓝色？"

Like she had to ask. My first pack had damn well better be my color.  
好像她还需要问似的。我的第一个背包最好是我喜欢的颜色。

I inhale again and I think of momma, before I'd ever even heard what an Evangelion was. Early Germany. Holding her hand in the street and marveling at the Schloss towering above us in Heidelberg. Flowers and buildings so old that I can't even fathom the first stone being laid down. Knights walked along these streets.  
我再次深吸一口气，想起了妈妈，那时我甚至还没听说过什么是 EVA。早期的德国。在街上牵着她的手，惊叹于海德堡上空高耸的城堡。花朵和古老得让我无法想象第一块石头是如何铺设的建筑。骑士们曾走过这些街道。

The oldest city in Tokyo-3 probably dates to the mid-1990s. I'm almost certainly older than this porch I'm standing on. How old am I again?  
东京-3 最古老的城市可能追溯到 1990 年代中期。我几乎肯定比我现在站的这个门廊还要老。我到底多大了？

Twenty... twenty-one now. Yeah, I'm twenty-one, right? Jesus, I'm drunk.  
二十...现在是二十一岁了。对，我二十一岁，没错吧？天哪，我醉了。

Beer eight happens somewhere around here. I fumble with the bottle opener, and it spills a little on the counter, but I don't mind. I'll clean it up later. Back to the porch. Another cig.  
第八瓶啤酒大概就在这儿。我摸索着开瓶器，洒了一点在柜台上，但我不在意。晚点再清理。回到门廊。再来一支烟。

More and more smoking just made sense. We're all dying anyway, right? It's not like by _not_ smoking you _won't_ die. I'm no hedonist, but it feels good and, like the booze, I think clearer with it. Sure, I scramble for my pack after movies or an exam, but if you're not self-destructive on some level, and you're not a fucking liar, then I don't really know what to say to you. 'Open your eyes', maybe. Open them up wide and see the madness of this existence for what it is: a story without a moral or an author. I think we invented stories to help us make sense of the fact that there is inherently very little in this place we live.  
越来越多地吸烟变得合情合理。反正我们都在走向死亡，不是吗？不吸烟并不会让你不死。我不是享乐主义者，但吸烟感觉很好，就像喝酒一样，它能让我更清晰地思考。当然，电影后或考试后我会急忙找我的烟盒，但如果你在某种程度上不是自我毁灭的，而且你不是个该死的骗子，那我真的不知道该对你说什么。也许，‘睁开你的眼睛’。睁大眼睛，看看这种存在的疯狂本质：一个没有道德或作者的故事。我想我们发明故事是为了帮助我们理解，我们居住的地方本质上非常有限。

I've been playing with the idea of going back to Europe for good. I don't know if there's anything left for me in this city. It's just bad memories. I walk down the avenue and remember a giant spider dribbling acid down my back. I could taste it in my mouth for a moment. I see a car accident and just remember how they felt when they crunched under my feet. Little bits of glass and rebar. The power of Japanese engineering.  
我一直在考虑永久回到欧洲。我不知道这座城市还有什么值得我留恋的。只有糟糕的回忆。我走在街上，想起一只巨大的蜘蛛将酸液滴在我背上。那一刻我都能尝到嘴里的味道。看到车祸，我只记得它们在我脚下被碾碎的感觉。小小的玻璃碎片和钢筋。日本工程的力量。

I could go _study_ in Heidelberg. There's an old college there – one of the first in Europe I think – and it's just beautiful. It's in a mountain pass, with green rising up around every side. It's a valley for sure, but it feels as if there are arms around you, just holding you tight. Like momma used to hold me.  
我可以去海德堡学习。那里有一所古老的学院——我想是欧洲最早的之一——而且非常美丽。它位于一个山口，四周绿意盎然。那是一个山谷，但感觉就像被双臂紧紧拥抱着，就像妈妈曾经拥抱我那样。

Or booze. Maybe Heidelberg just feels like binge drinking?  
或者酗酒。也许海德堡给人的感觉就像是在酗酒狂欢？

Inhale again. Drink again. My body is a biological shit show right now, I'm sure.  
再次吸气。再次饮酒。我的身体现在肯定是一团糟。

For the millionth time, I wonder what's keeping me in this godforsaken place, but I already know the answer to that question.  
无数次，我疑惑是什么让我留在这鬼地方，但我早已知道这个问题的答案。

It's not like he speaks German. It's not like he'd follow me.  
他又不讲德语，也不可能跟着我。

Also, wouldn't that be admitting it? Admitting even more explicitly than words. Hell, he probably _would_ follow me, but how could I let him? He's got a life here. I won't let him start back at square one just because of my selfishness.  
再者，那不就等于承认了吗？比言语更直白地承认。天哪，他或许真的会跟来，但我怎能让他这么做？他在这里有自己的生活。我不能因为自己的自私就让他从头开始。

I lean against the balcony and let the wind blow across my face. I'm sweating a little, even though it's a chilly night. Alcohol and cigarettes will do that to you. My internal temperature should be about thirty-eigh-  
我倚靠在阳台上，任由风吹拂过脸庞。尽管是个寒冷的夜晚，我还是微微出汗了。酒精和香烟就是有这样的效果。我的体温应该在三十八度左右——

Oh shit. 哦，该死。

Fumbling the bottle, I watch it cascade out of my hands, half-full, and explode on the ground below. I hide for a moment out of childish instinct, and then slowly raise myself back up to look at the damage I caused. The bottle is in a million pieces, just like the cars used to be under my feet. It didn't hit anyone, which is good, but there are a couple of pissed off people who are looking angrily up at me. I laugh at them, four stories above their ire.  
我笨拙地握着酒瓶，看着它从手中滑落，半满的液体在空中洒落，随后在下方的地面上炸裂开来。出于孩童般的本能，我躲藏了一会儿，然后慢慢起身查看自己造成的破坏。瓶子碎成了无数片，就像曾经在我脚下被碾碎的汽车一样。幸好没砸到人，这算是个好消息，但有几个人正愤怒地抬头瞪着我。我站在四层楼高的地方，对着他们的怒火放声大笑。

"Run for your lives!" I yell down, giggling. "This neighborhood is unsafe! There's a crazy person out!"  
“快逃命吧！”我大喊着，咯咯笑道，“这地方不安全！有个疯子在外面！”

I laugh at my own joke, collapsing back onto the porch. Someone yells something inflammatory back up at me, but honestly I could _give_ a fuck. I saved your life, asshole. You and your daughter and your mother and your father and that girl you jerked off to in high school. All of their lives depend on me and how good I am at saving them. You should be thanking your lucky stars you had the privilege of meeting me, regardless of how shitfaced I am.  
我自嘲地笑了笑，瘫倒在门廊上。有人朝我大喊些挑衅的话，但说实话，我他妈才不在乎。我救了你的命，混蛋。你和你女儿、你母亲、你父亲，还有那个高中时你对着她打飞机的女孩。他们所有人的性命都取决于我，以及我救他们的能力。你应该庆幸自己有幸遇见我，不管我醉成什么样子。

I am Asuka Langley Sohryu. I save the world every day. That's on me.  
我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。我每天都在拯救世界。这是我的责任。

Well, not anymore. Now all that's 'on me' is me.  
好吧，不再是了。现在‘在我身上’的，只有我自己。

I frown. 我皱起眉头。

After several moments of fumbling, I realize the cigarettes went over the balcony with the bottle. And that's unfortunate.  
摸索了几分钟后，我发现香烟和瓶子一起掉到了阳台外。这真是倒霉。

I think there's another pack in my bedroom.  
我想卧室里还有另一包。

It takes both hands to haul myself up and back into the apartment. Everything spins in our living room, where Shinji keeps his cello and all of our movies are. Pacific Rim catches my eye and my memory pulls the movie out for me to see again. It actually wasn't terrible considering how much of Nerv was classified at the time. Hilariously inaccurate, but that wasn't their fault. Happy ending, monsters dead, cute Japanese girl forehead touch.  
我得用双手才能把自己拉回公寓。客厅里的一切都在旋转，那里放着真嗣的大提琴和我们的所有电影。《环太平洋》吸引了我的目光，记忆为我再次播放了这部电影。考虑到当时 NERV 的许多机密，它其实并不糟糕。虽然荒谬地不准确，但这不是他们的错。结局美满，怪兽死了，可爱的日本女孩额头相触。

I snicker. "You idiot," I say to Guillermo del Toro, "there are no happy endings."  
我轻声笑了出来。“你这个傻瓜，”我对吉尔莫·德尔·托罗说，“没有幸福的结局。”

But really what I mean is that there are usually no endings at all. Life doesn't end until it _ends_, and there certainly aren't credits after it. There aren't sequels if it grosses over $500 million.  
但实际上，我的意思是通常根本没有结局。生活直到结束才算结束，当然也不会有片尾字幕。如果票房超过 5 亿美元，也不会有续集。

I hate bad endings, and every ending is bad.  
我讨厌糟糕的结局，而每个结局都是糟糕的。

Which is why I'm still single, even when I feel his hand on my back longer than it should be. Or when I leave the door unlocked when I shower, just in case. Or how I pay more attention to our legs touching when we're on the couch than I do whatever it is we're watching. Or how I should practically name my vibrator after him at this point. He wouldn't have three power settings, though, he would know exactly when and how to-  
这就是为什么我至今单身，即便我能感受到他的手在我背上停留的时间比应有的更长。或者当我洗澡时故意不锁门，以防万一。又或者我更关注我们在沙发上腿部接触的时刻，而不是我们在看什么。甚至到现在，我几乎要把我的震动器以他的名字命名了。不过，他不会有三种功率设置，他会知道确切的时间和方式——

Oh, look, there's the pack. I grab it and head back to the porch.  
哦，看，背包在那儿。我拿起它，回到门廊。

I trip and fall onto it, only barely catching myself on the table. I chuckle. "Guten Tag, Herr Veranda. Wie gehts? Alles gut bei dir?"  
我绊了一下，差点摔倒在桌上。我轻笑道：“日安，阳台先生。您好吗？一切可好？”

_Ja, alles gut.  是的，一切都好。_

"Ah, fantastisch! Toll. Ich auch."  
“啊，太棒了！真好。我也是。”

Licht für die Zigarette. 给香烟点个火。

_Aber du bist getrunken, jetzt?  
但你现在喝醉了，对吧？_

"Ja, genau, und es ist das beste."  
是的，没错，而且这是最好的。

Oh, it is. There's no big bad world here. There's no more Evas or Angels or sync tests. Hell, I technically have _homework_ to do, which is a weird concept when you've watched people die. Right now, I can boil the earth down to just me and this porch.  
哦，确实如此。这里没有险恶的世界，不再有 EVA、使徒或同步测试。见鬼，我理论上还有作业要做，这在目睹了人们死去后显得颇为怪异。此刻，我能将整个地球简化成我和这个门廊。

Well, not just. 当然，不止如此。

Unbidden, I remember some awful German pop song from near when I was born. It just pops into my head, even though I really didn't want it to. It's some slow love song mama used to like. I think that's where I heard it first. All I know is that before I can even control it, I'm singing it. It's weird how you remember lyrics to songs only when they come out of you.  
不由自主地，我想起了出生不久后听到的一首糟糕的德国流行歌曲。它突然闯入我的脑海，尽管我并不希望如此。这是一首妈妈曾经喜欢的慢节奏情歌。我想我最初是在她那里听到的。我只知道，在我能控制之前，我已经开始唱了。奇怪的是，歌词只有在脱口而出时才会被记起。

My voice cracks and my words slur. I'm no pop idol, but I know every note.  
我的声音沙哑，说话含糊。我不是流行偶像，但我熟悉每一个音符。

"_Du bist das beste was mir je passiert ist  
“你是我遇到过的最好的事”  
Es tut so gut, wie du mich liebst  
你爱我，感觉真好  
Vergess' den Rest der Welt,  
忘却世界的其余部分，  
Wenn do bei mir bist…"  
当你在我身边时…_

It's the chorus, and I sing it again, louder. I'm practically shouting it off the balcony at this point. I might be getting cops called on me tonight, but the world needs to know this song. They need to know -  
这是副歌，我又大声唱了一遍。我几乎是在阳台上对着外面大喊。今晚可能会有人报警，但这个世界需要知道这首歌。他们需要知道——

I feel the tears on my face before I was even aware they were happening. Wh-what? Why am I…? I wipe them away angrily, but they won't stop coming. Collapsing to my knees, I cover my mouth and just decide to let it go. It's not like anyone's here to see.  
我甚至在意识到之前就感受到了脸上的泪水。什、什么？为什么我会……？我愤怒地擦去它们，但它们就是止不住。我跪倒在地，捂住嘴巴，决定就这样放任不管。反正也没人在看。

Jesus, that's embarrassing. That's a fucking awful song, it's what old women listen to. Why is this garbage hitting my heart like this?  
天哪，真尴尬。那首歌糟透了，是老妇人听的。为什么这种垃圾会如此触动我的心？

Pop songs are engineered to literally be accessible to anyone, which is why they're lyrically so bland and vague, but every once in a while one of those damn songs lines up with your life and then, well, you're me. On my balcony, drunk as hell, crying my eyes out.  
流行歌曲就是为了能让任何人都能接受而设计的，这就是为什么它们的歌词如此平淡和模糊，但偶尔有那么一首该死的歌与你的生活契合，然后，好吧，你就成了我。在阳台上，酩酊大醉，泪流满面。

I just… can't. 我只是…做不到。

I can't leave him here. There's no one to go back to in Germany, there's nothing for me there but more dead livers and diseased lungs. We could talk online, but it's not like that would be the same. It's not like he'd be there to ask me how my day was when I got home. I'd never hear that cello wake me up in the morning. We'd never have nights where he cooks and I clean, which is annoying at first, but then it becomes a ritual and then he has to clean them again because you're so bad at it…  
我不能把他留在这里。在德国，我没有可以回去的人，那里除了更多死去的肝脏和病变的肺别无他物。我们可以在线聊天，但那不会是一样的。不像他会在那里问我回家时的一天过得如何。我再也听不到那大提琴在早晨唤醒我。我们再也不会有他做饭我洗碗的夜晚，一开始很烦人，但后来变成了仪式，然后他又得重新洗一遍，因为你太不擅长了……

Oh hell. 哦，该死。

I really can't do this. I can't keep falling in love with him. I have to get out of this apartment and this city before I do something I regret. That we both regret.  
我真的做不到。我不能继续爱上他。我必须在做出让我们都后悔的事情之前离开这个公寓和这座城市。

But that would be an end of sorts, wouldn't it? Hypothetically the friendship would live on, but it would be electronic. Strained and truncated across wifi and phone lines. It would hardly be a friendship at all, would it? Not the one I want, anyway.  
但这某种程度上也是一种结束，不是吗？假设友谊会继续存在，但它将变成电子化的。通过无线网络和电话线传递，紧张而简短。那几乎算不上是友谊，对吧？至少不是我想要的那种。

Maybe here is the best? Maybe it would be… nice, to be a couple? To hold hands and kiss like people actually do. Maybe we could make it work?  
也许这里是最好的？也许成为一对会很……美好？像人们真正做的那样牵手和亲吻。也许我们能成功呢？

Maybe Shinji is rig- 也许真嗣是对的——

Oh shit, I'm gonna throw up. Yeah, I'm throwing up now.  
哦该死，我要吐了。没错，我现在就要吐了。

I manage to stumble to the bathroom before I do, and at least that is a mercy. That and Shinji's late class. I'd hate for him to have seen me like this. I was a god once, and now I'm holding my hair behind my head so I don't have to take a shower after.  
我勉强跌跌撞撞地冲进浴室，至少这算是一种仁慈。还有就是真嗣的课迟到了。我可不想让他看到我这副模样。我曾经是神，而现在我只能抓着头发，免得事后还得洗头。

It doesn't really work, and I do have to shower it off. It'll be good to get the stink of beer off me as well.  
这东西其实不太管用，我还得洗掉它。能去掉身上的啤酒味也不错。

Throwing on a shirt and panties, I'm still drunk enough to not notice I'm falling asleep in Shinji's bed. I can smell him on the pillow.  
套上衬衫和内裤，我醉得连自己躺在真嗣床上睡着了都没察觉。枕头上还留着他的气味。

_Shinji… my Baka-Shinji… 真嗣……我的笨蛋真嗣……_

When I wake up in his arms, I don't even notice the hangover. It's warm here. It's so warm, and it feels like something that should have been happening forever. I feel his soft breathing whisper against my hair and I'm too afraid to turn around. I can't wake him up, I don't want to talk right now. I wouldn't know what to say, anyway.  
当我从他的怀抱中醒来，宿醉的痕迹丝毫未觉。这里温暖如春。如此温暖，仿佛本该永恒如此。我感受到他轻柔的呼吸拂过我的发丝，却不敢转身。我不愿吵醒他，此刻也不想交谈。即便开口，我也不知该说些什么。

I have to stay here. I have to go back to Germany. I… I don't know what I have to do.  
我必须留在这里。我必须返回德国。我……我不知道我该做什么。

All I know is that I want this. I want this every night and that want is growing stronger daily. I fight off drifting to sleep again. I want to remember this.  
我只知道我渴望这份温暖。每晚都渴望，且这份渴望日益强烈。我强忍困意，不愿再次入睡。我要铭记这一刻。

I stay as still as I can and let him hold me until I start feeling him stir, when I run away.  
我尽可能保持静止，让他抱着我，直到感觉到他开始动弹，我才跑开。

We don't talk about it at breakfast, and we probably never will.  
早餐时我们没有谈论这件事，也许永远也不会。

_AN: Sorry for all the German in this chapter. It's been my experience that the more drunk someone is the more inclined they are to forget what language they're speaking, but if you don't speak it, then we've got Google Translate ready and looking for jobs. Support that Google Translator; I worry about its job security.  
作者注：很抱歉这一章里有很多德语。根据我的经验，人越醉就越容易忘记自己说的是哪种语言，但如果你不懂德语，那么我们有谷歌翻译随时待命，寻找工作机会。支持那位谷歌翻译员吧；我担心它的工作稳定性。_

_Another music recommendation while I'm on such a **roll** here: any and every Arctic Monkeys album. Yes, even Humbug. If you've never shuddered over the ghost of a past lover while listening to Cornerstone, then I'm not sure I get you anymore.  
趁现在势头正猛，再推荐一张音乐专辑：北极猴子的每一张专辑，没错，包括《Humbug》。如果你从未在听《Cornerstone》时因过去爱人的幽灵而颤抖，那我可能不太理解你了。_

_I mean, we can still be friends, but I don't totally get you. Just know that.  
我是说，我们还是可以做朋友，但我并不完全理解你。这一点你要知道。_

_Genuinely though, thank you all for the kind words and support. You've only ever shown yourselves to be eternally sweet and welcoming people and it is very appreciated.  
真心感谢大家的善意话语和支持。你们总是展现出永恒的甜蜜和热情，这非常令人感激。_

_Also, as a genuine question: what was the album that got YOU through a tough patch in your life, be it high school or what have you? Post answers in your reviews if you're so inclined.  
另外，作为一个真诚的问题：哪张专辑曾在你的生活中陪你度过了一段艰难时光，无论是高中时期还是其他什么阶段？如果你愿意，可以在评论中分享你的答案。_

"Do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there,  
你是否凝视镜中，只为确认自己的存在，  
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?  
还是说，某人的晚安吻已经解决了这个问题？  
When I'm not being honest  
当我不够坦诚时  
I pretend that you were just some lover."  
我假装你只是某个情人。

Days turn into endless numbered days and before I know it, I realize what's bothering me. Stupid really. I should have seen it coming, but it's her hand on his arm. It's her smile when he shuffles through his unorganized notes. It's the transparence of all her flirty-flirty giggles and fucking obnoxious brown eyes.  
日子变成了无尽的编号日，不知不觉中，我意识到困扰我的原因。真是愚蠢。我本该预见到，但却是她的手搭在他的手臂上。是他翻阅杂乱笔记时她的微笑。是她那些透明的调情笑声和那双该死的、令人讨厌的棕色眼睛。

It's all of it just rolled together into the shitheap that is 'Hitomi', and she sits next to Shinji in our elective lecture class.  
这一切都汇聚成了名为‘瞳美’的垃圾堆，她坐在我们的选修课上，紧挨着真嗣。

I'm puffing away outside after the lesson, when she steps up to me with a bright smile on her face, all innocence and smiles and "I'm-just-too-damn-precious-to-know-sadness". Get off it, girlie. I'm onto your sexy schoolgirl act.  
课后我正抽着烟在外面透气，她带着灿烂的笑容走到我面前，一脸天真无邪和“我真是太可爱了，根本不懂悲伤”的样子。得了吧，小妞。我可看穿了你那撩人的女学生把戏。

"Sohryu?" she chirps, clutching her binder to her chest. It's not a bad chest, either. She makes sure to accentuate that with her pushup bras and tight sweaters. I'm sure Shinji's noticed.  
“惣流？”她欢快地叫道，把笔记本紧紧抱在胸前。她的胸也不赖。她总是用托胸内衣和紧身毛衣来凸显这一点。我敢肯定，真嗣已经注意到了。

I take a drag and blow some smoke into the air, surreptitiously aiming it at her face.  
我吸了一口烟，悄悄地朝她脸上吐了些烟雾。

Bullseye. Still got it. 正中靶心。宝刀未老。

"Yeah, what's up?" She makes a show of coughing before continuing.  
“耶，怎么了？”她故意咳嗽了一声，然后继续说道。

"I was just wondering… you're roommates with Ikari, right?"  
“我只是在想……你和碇是室友，对吧？”

Is she trying to be funny?  
她是在开玩笑吗？

"…yes." "……是的。"

Hitomi shuffles her feet before continuing.  
瞳美挪了挪脚，继续说道。

"Well, he invited me over for dinner tonight, and I was wondering if I should, like, bring anything?"  
"嗯，他邀请我今晚去他家吃饭，我在想是不是应该带点什么？"

Her voice makes the statement end in a question, even though I think it's actually some kind of challenge. She's asking permission from me, and I'm sure she's aware of that. She smiles sweetly, but I see the teeth behind it.  
她的声音让这句话听起来像是个问题，尽管我觉得这实际上更像是一种挑战。她在向我寻求许可，而我确信她自己也清楚这一点。她甜甜地笑着，但我看到了笑容背后的锋芒。

I toss my cigarette onto the ground and start to walk away before calling back.  
我把烟头扔在地上，开始走开，然后又回头喊道。

"Vodka, rum, or beer. If it tastes expensive he'll be into it. He's quite a drinker, that one."  
"伏特加、朗姆酒还是啤酒。如果味道显得高档，他就会喜欢。他可是个酒鬼，那个家伙。"

---

Running out of cigarettes when you need one is a pain like no other, so I'm giving in and at a shop buying some. The Marlboros, I guess. It doesn't matter at this point. Honestly, I might have just needed some air. Some alone time, away from Miss Flirty Full C-Cup and the asshole who is my roommate.  
烟瘾上来时没烟抽简直是无法忍受的痛苦，所以我妥协了，在一家店里买些。万宝路吧，反正这时候也无所谓了。说实话，我可能只是需要透透气。需要一点独处的时间，远离那位风情万种的 C 罩杯小姐和我那混蛋室友。

Walking home, I hear the scene before I see it. Two policemen, standing over a homeless man in an alleyway. One is shaking his shoulder, and the other is interviewing witnesses.  
走在回家的路上，我先听到了动静才看到场景。两名警察，站在小巷里的一名流浪汉旁边。一个在摇他的肩膀，另一个在询问目击者。

"Did he say anything before he collapsed?"  
"他倒下之前有说什么吗？"

"No. He was high on something though. Could be anything. If it's that-" the witness mimes a needle into his arm, "-then I don't know what. It's a hot night."  
"没有。不过他当时像是嗑了什么药。可能是任何东西。如果是那种——" 目击者用手势比划着往手臂上注射，"——那我就不知道了。今晚挺热的。"

"Sir," says the other police officer, shaking the man. "Sir, if you don't stand up and get walking, we're going to have to call an ambulance."  
"先生，" 另一名警察摇晃着那人说道，"先生，如果你不站起来走动，我们恐怕得叫救护车了。"

The man on the ground says something unintelligible, and stirs enough to show he's still alive. His display of trying to stand is halfhearted and pathetic, he can't even get his torso off the ground, and his feet don't move at all.  
地上那人含糊不清地说着什么，动了动身子，表明他还活着。他试图站起来的样子既无力又可怜，连上半身都抬不起来，双脚更是纹丝不动。

The police officer sighs, "Sir, I'm gonna give you two minutes to get up, and if you're not on your feet, then we're making the call."  
警察叹了口气，"先生，我给你两分钟时间站起来，如果你还站不起来，那我们就要打电话了。"

I'm halfway home when I hear an ambulance speed by me. It might be for some car accident, but in my gut I know it's for that poor, unwashed bastard who's too high to realize that this is probably the worst night of his life.  
我走到半路时，听到一辆救护车从我身边疾驰而过。可能是为了某起车祸，但直觉告诉我，这是为了那个可怜的、蓬头垢面的家伙，他吸毒过量，意识不清，可能还没意识到这可能是他一生中最糟糕的夜晚。

Things that sound the same in any language: laughter, orgasms, and crying so hard that you're actually screaming.  
任何语言中听起来都一样的声音：笑声、高潮，还有哭到声嘶力竭。

I'm currently at the third option, through the clamor I still hear Shinji knocking on my door. I locked it at some point, because I knew this shit was going south. Things were going to turn ugly and all I could tell through the haze in my blood was that dumb cunt Hitomi wasn't going to have the god damn satisfaction of knowing she'd beaten me. I've cried so much in the last couple of months that I can sense it when it's coming – it's like a groundswell from the bottom of my stomach that rises until it boils over. I didn't cry this much, before. I think I was stronger during the Eva program, or at the very least I was still full of potential.  
我现在正处于第三种状态，尽管嘈杂，我仍能听到真嗣在敲我的门。我不知何时锁上了它，因为我知道这破事要往坏处发展。事情即将变得丑陋，而我透过血液中的迷雾所能告诉自己的是，那个愚蠢的婊子瞳不会得到她妈的知道她打败了我的满足感。过去几个月我哭得太多，以至于我能感觉到它何时来临——就像从胃底涌起的巨浪，升腾直至沸腾溢出。以前我并没有这么爱哭。我觉得我在 EVA 计划期间更坚强，或者至少那时我还有无限可能。

Then again, what is potential but a promise you break to yourself?  
再者说，所谓潜力不就是你对自己食言的承诺吗？

So, locked door, enough alcohol to kill most people, and here I am. This is near blackout stages – I'm already feeling hazy about the last couple of hours. My sheets are a ball around me, wet from tears and whatever else I've been doing. I take the pillow away from my face and I hold my breath, to listen.  
于是，门锁着，酒多到足以放倒大多数人，而我就在这里。这已经接近昏迷阶段了——我对过去几个小时的记忆已经模糊不清。我的床单在我周围纠结成一团，湿漉漉的，沾满了泪水和我所做的一切。我把枕头从脸上移开，屏住呼吸，倾听。

There's a beat of silence, and then a voice, muffled by my door.  
一阵沉默过后，一个声音透过我的门传来，有些模糊。

"…Asuka?" “……明日香？”

I bury my face in the pillow again.  
我又将脸埋进了枕头里。

"Is she still here?!" I call, probably too loudly. I'm shouting through pillow and door and at least a quart of vodka. It _was_ good stuff. I'll give her that.  
“她还在吗？！”我喊道，可能声音太大了。我隔着枕头和门，至少还有一夸脱伏特加，在向她喊话。那是好东西。这点我得承认她。

Shinji lets out a breath of disappointment. "Hitomi left almost an hour ago, Asuka. I told you that."  
真嗣失望地叹了口气。“瞳美几乎一小时前就走了，明日香。我告诉过你了。”

Oh. Oh, yeah, he did.  
哦。哦，是的，他确实做了。

I've lucid enough to know that I'm fucked. There's no way out of this one. There's no playing it off like it was just a few drinks that got carried away. This is cry-for-help stuff. This is an inexcusable moment, and I'm hiding from it in my room like a little girl afraid of the monsters in her closet.  
我清醒到足以明白自己完蛋了。这次无路可逃。没法装作只是几杯酒下肚失控了。这是求救的信号。这是一个不可原谅的时刻，而我像个小女孩一样躲在房间里，害怕衣柜里的怪物。

Who am I kidding? I am the monster. There's probably nothing more terrifying to me than myself. One day that will end, though, and things will be alright. Maybe the end isn't just a long sleep, but something inconceivably peaceful? I'd like to think so, but I don't really think it's anything at all. I think it's just… nothing. Blackness and void and no more having to look in the mirror. Which is something I guess.  
我在自欺欺人什么？我就是那个怪物。对我来说，没有什么比自己更可怕的了。但总有一天这一切会结束，事情会好起来的。也许结局不仅仅是长眠，而是难以想象的平静？我愿意这么想，但其实我不认为会有任何结果。我想那只是……虚无。黑暗与空虚，再也不必面对镜子。这算是一种解脱吧。

But I have to talk to Shinji. I have to show him I'm okay right now.  
但我必须和真嗣谈谈。我得让他看到我现在还好。

I get up and I wipe the remnants of tears off of my face. It's probably a futile gesture, because I know I look like I just got hit by a truck, but there's still some part of me that has pride that I was once beautiful. I've always wanted him to remember me that way.  
我站起身，擦去脸上的泪痕。这或许是无用之举，因为我知道自己看起来就像刚被卡车撞过一样，但内心深处仍有一丝骄傲，曾经我也美丽动人。我一直希望他能记住我那时的模样。

Beauty, like potential, seems to fizzle out pretty quickly.  
美丽，如同潜力，似乎很快就会消散无踪。

I make several stumbling steps towards my door and I slide it open.  
我踉跄了几步走向我的房门，然后滑开它。

And I instantly feel like a child who's been caught stealing. Shinji glares at me, arms crossed and face frowning.  
我立刻感觉自己像个被抓到偷东西的孩子。真嗣瞪着我，双臂交叉，眉头紧皱。

I crack my neck and I concentrate on not slurring my words. I wipe away the excess moisture I still feel clinging to my cheek.  
我扭了扭脖子，集中精神不让自己的话含糊不清。我擦掉了脸上仍感觉黏附的多余水分。

"Hey, what's up?" "嘿，怎么了？"

He sighs, burying his face in his hands.  
他叹了口气，双手掩面。

"Come on," he says, looping an arm underneath me, "you need to take a shower."  
"来吧，"他说着，将手臂环在我身下，"你需要洗个澡。"

Shinji starts dragging me across the apartment, but I hook my arm around the top of our table and I manage to halt him for a second.  
真嗣开始拖着我穿过公寓，但我用胳膊勾住了桌子的顶部，设法让他停了一会儿。

"No, no! Wait," I say, almost mechanically. I feel the part at the back of my brain remembering how to deal with yourself when you're shitfaced. I decide to follow the suggestions, even though they sound completely ludicrous to me right now. "Water. I should drink water."  
“不，不！等等，”我几乎是机械地说道。我感觉脑后某个部分在回忆如何应对烂醉如泥的你。我决定采纳这些建议，尽管它们现在听起来完全荒谬。“水。我应该喝水。”

Shinji lets me collapse into a chair and turns around to fetch a cup for me and fill it from the tap.  
真嗣让我瘫坐在椅子上，转身去给我拿杯子，从水龙头接满水。

I put my face in my hands and let all the shame catch up.  
我双手掩面，任由所有的羞愧感涌上心头。

"I'm… I'm sorry I ruined your night," I mumble. I had to say it. Part of me hopes he didn't hear me.  
“我……对不起，毁了你的夜晚，”我咕哝着。我不得不说出口。心里的一部分希望他没有听到。

"Asuka, come on. I don't care about that," Shinji replies, turning with the water. "She just kept asking me for dinner, and I wanted to be polite. I thought it would do you good, as well."  
“明日香，别这样。我不在乎那个，”真嗣回答，随着水流转身。“她一直邀请我共进晚餐，我想表现得礼貌些。我也觉得这对你有好处。”

I let out a loud bark of a laugh.  
我发出了一声响亮的笑声，像狗吠一样。

"Oh yeah, I get along famously with strangers, Shinji. You know me."  
“哦，没错，我和陌生人相处得特别好，真嗣。你了解我的。”

"Well, if I'd known this would have happened, I would have been okay just being rude," he says.  
“好吧，如果我早知道会发生这种事，我宁愿一开始就表现得粗鲁些。”他说。

I laugh again, tossing my head back to finish the water in a single chug. I start to stand up to fill it again when Shinji takes it from my hands.  
我又笑了，仰头一口气喝完水。正要起身再去装满时，真嗣从我手中接过了水瓶。

"Just sit down for a minute."  
“就坐一会儿吧。”

And I do. 我照做了。

Tap back on. The inimitable sound of water filling a glass.  
轻触返回。那独一无二的水填满玻璃杯的声音。

"I don't care about Hitomi, or the night, Asuka. I just need you to promise me something."  
“我不在乎瞳，也不在乎夜晚，明日香。我只需要你答应我一件事。”

Yes, anything. "What's that?"  
“好的，任何事。是什么？”

He hands me the glass. "That you're never going to do this shit again."  
他把杯子递给我。“你再也不会做这种蠢事了。”

The water trembles in my hands. I'm not sure I'm thirsty anymore.  
水在我手中颤抖。我不再确定自己是否还口渴。

There was a time when he'd have rather leapt from a window than speak to me that way.  
曾经有一段时间，他宁愿从窗户跳下去也不愿那样跟我说话。

"Come again?" I say. "再说一遍？" 我说。

"This! This whole routine!" Shinji spreads his arms. "Drinking yourself blind! Locking yourself in your room with a fucking knife!"  
"就是这个！这一整套行为！" 真嗣张开双臂。"把自己灌得烂醉！把自己锁在房间里，还拿着一把该死的刀！"

There… there was a knife?  
那里…有一把刀？

I don't even remember that. What was I…? Why did I grab the…?  
我甚至不记得那件事了。我当时在……？为什么要抓那个……？

He must see the shock on my face, because he softens before continuing.  
他一定看到了我脸上的震惊，因为他语气柔和地继续说道。

"This… this isn't you, Asuka. This isn't you at all."  
“这……这不是你，明日香。这根本不是你。”

My throat is dry, and I take a long drink before continuing.  
我的喉咙干涩，喝了一大口水后才继续。

"…yes it is." "…是的，没错。"

Shinji doesn't answer, so I continue, tears starting to form in my eyes again. It all comes tumbling out of me in a torrent, all of the things I was whispering into the pillow like a mantra – the thoughts that have been plaguing me for months. The things I think about every time I've finished a six pack alone.  
真嗣没有回答，于是我继续说下去，泪水再次在眼眶中打转。所有的话像洪水般倾泻而出，那些我像咒语一样对着枕头低语的想法——困扰了我几个月的念头。每次独自喝完六罐啤酒后，我都会想到的那些事。

"It _is_ me. This is me now. I'm not a hero! I was supposed to be _great_, but I'm an alcoholic, underachieving _asshole_, who doesn't even have the social acumen to make friends if they didn't know me before I became this shitstain! I'm nothing! I'm nobody at all!" I have to take a shuddering breath in to gather the air to finish. "I lie awake at night and I just think that if I weren't here, no one would even notice anymo-"  
"这就是我。现在的我。我不是英雄！我本该是伟大的，但我却是个酗酒、一事无成的混蛋，连交朋友的能力都没有，除非他们在我变成这摊烂泥之前就认识我！我什么都不是！我根本不存在！" 我不得不深吸一口气，颤抖着聚集空气来完成这句话。"我夜不能寐，只是想着如果我不在这里，根本没人会注意到，甚至不会在意-"

A slap to my face.  
一记耳光打在我脸上。

Which I wasn't counting on.  
这是我没预料到的。

It stings hot red, across my right, and I'm so thrown by it that I put a hand to my cheek to feel if it really happened.  
那一下火辣辣的，打在我右边脸上，我被这突如其来的打击弄得愣住了，不由得伸手去摸脸颊，想确认这是不是真的发生了。

Which it did. 确实发生了。

I look at him, and I realize that he's shaking, too.  
我看着他，意识到他也在颤抖。

"I'm only going to say this once, so listen up," his voice starts to gain volume, "you are Asuka Langley Sohryu. You're the greatest Evangelion pilot who's ever lived," his voice is shaking now. "You're the smartest person I've ever met, and honestly I think you can do whatever the hell you want to if you set your mind to it. Anything. You're just having a rough time, and you think you can't talk to me about it, which is ridiculous. Do you think I don't feel those things, too? We're in this _together_, Asuka, you're probably my best friend in the world, and if we can't count on each other then I really don't know what…"  
"我只会说这一次，所以听好了，"他的声音开始提高，"你是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。你是史上最伟大的 EVA 驾驶员，"他的声音现在颤抖着。"你是我见过的最聪明的人，说实话，如果你下定决心，我觉得你可以做任何你想做的事。任何事。你只是现在遇到了困难，你觉得不能和我谈这些，这太荒谬了。你以为我就没有这些感觉吗？我们是一起的，明日香，你可能是我世界上最好的朋友，如果我们不能互相依靠，那我真的不知道……"

He trails off for a moment, before looking back into my eyes, with a rueful smile.  
他顿了一下，然后带着一丝苦笑再次看向我的眼睛。

"And come on, Asuka. Don't say things like 'no one would notice'. I would notice." He looks at me, and I know that he's holding back tears as well. "I'd notice every day for the rest of my life, and you know damn well I would. I'd miss the hell out of you…"  
"拜托，明日香。别说'没人会注意到'这种话。我会注意到的。"他看着我，我知道他也在强忍泪水。"我会在余生的每一天都注意到，你很清楚我会。我会非常想念你……"

He looks down. 他低头看去。

"So don't say things like that. And don't do this shit again. You're better than this."  
“所以别再说那种话了。也别再搞这种破事。你比这强多了。”

I blink. 我眨了眨眼。

"Promise me," he insists.  
"答应我，" 他坚持道。

And I do. 我确实答应了。

After a moment, he looks back up and sighs.  
过了一会儿，他抬起头，叹了口气。

"Come on," he says, taking my hand again. "Shower."  
“来吧，”他说着，再次握住我的手。“去洗澡。”

Several seconds later, he's slipping my shirt over my head, because I don't have the presence of mind to do it myself, anymore.  
几秒钟后，他帮我脱下衬衫，因为我已经没有意识自己动手了。

And then blessed water is pouring down on my face, and I feel the love of god.  
接着，神圣的水流倾泻在我脸上，我感受到了上帝的爱。

I… I never realized that the Evas ending would have hurt Shinji, too. Even if he didn't identify with it the way I did, he must have felt _some_ repercussions from the whole life he knew ending in a flash. He was closer to Misato than I was, certainly, and Rei. God knows where they are now. Ghosts in the abyss that was Nerv.  
我……我从没意识到 EVA 的结局也会伤害到真嗣。即使他没有像我那样感同身受，他一定也感受到了他所熟知的一切在瞬间终结的冲击。他比我更亲近美里，当然，还有绫波。天知道他们现在在哪里。Nerv 的深渊中游荡的幽灵。

Christ, why did I never talk to him about this? Did I think he would hurt me? He's Shinji! Shinji couldn't hurt someone if he trie-  
该死，为什么我从未和他谈过这些？我以为他会伤害我吗？他是真嗣啊！真嗣就算想伤害人也做不到——

And that's when I realize I'm naked.  
就在这时，我意识到自己一丝不挂。

"H-hey! Get back in here!" I yell, covering myself. He's beyond the shower curtain, so there's no way he can see anything right now, but my embarrassment hasn't figured that out yet. I definitely didn't undress myself, and right now, even with everything that's happened tonight, that thought terrifies me beyond reason.  
"嘿！回来！" 我喊道，慌忙遮住自己。他站在浴帘外，所以现在他肯定什么也看不见，但我的尴尬还没意识到这一点。我绝对没有自己脱衣服，而现在，尽管今晚发生了这么多事，这个念头还是让我惊恐万分。

"Asuka, are you okay?!" the reply comes from over the divider. He's standing in the bathroom, for sure.  
"明日香，你还好吗？！" 他的声音从隔板那边传来。他肯定站在浴室里。

"Did um… did you see…" my words are flopping around like fish out of water. "…what did you just see?!"  
"呃……你看到了……" 我的话像离水的鱼一样乱跳。"……你刚才看到了什么？！"

I hear him chuckle, from beyond the glass.  
我听到他在玻璃的另一边轻笑。

"I closed my eyes, Asuka. I didn't see anything except underwear."  
“我闭上了眼睛，明日香。除了内衣，我什么也没看见。”

I turn a bright vermillion. "You idiot! That's private stuff!"  
我脸红得像熟透的番茄。“你这个白痴！那是隐私的东西！”

"I _wash_ your underwear, Asuka, I know what it all looks like," another laugh. "I got you down to there and you did the rest. With my eyes closed and facing the other direction. I swear."  
“我给你洗内裤呢，明日香，我知道它们都长什么样，”他又笑了笑。“我把你送到那儿，剩下的你自己来。我闭着眼，背对着你。我发誓。”

I open my mouth to prepare a string of obscenities, but several seconds later I close it, because I believe him completely. He's being a gentleman, even now. He always is. How many times this month has he had to take care of my drunk ass? How many times has he cooked breakfast for me when I was so hungover I couldn't open my eyes? He let me cheat off of his test for that one time I forgot to study, he picks up the groceries when I don't have time, he washes my sheets, he… he's everything I've ever wanted in a…  
我张开嘴准备骂出一串脏话，但几秒钟后我闭上了，因为我完全相信他。他现在依然是个绅士。他总是如此。这个月他得照顾我这个醉鬼多少次？我宿醉到眼睛都睁不开时，他为我做了多少次早餐？那次我忘了复习，他让我抄了他的试卷，我没时间买菜时他帮我拎回来，他洗我的床单，他……他是我梦寐以求的一切……

After several long moments standing under a torrent of water, I open my mouth again.  
在花洒下站了许久后，我又张开了嘴。

"I think we should date."  
"我觉得我们应该交往。"

No laughter now. Silence and the sound of a person thinking, if that's a sound at all. I can hear it over the running water, in my state.  
此刻没有笑声。沉默和思考的声音，如果那算是一种声音的话。在我这种状态下，我能听见它盖过了流水声。

"…what?" "……什么？"

"I don't ever want you to see that girl again. I want to be your girlfriend and I want us to date. I think we should do that," I swallow, ashamed that I didn't have the courage to do this face-to-face.  
“我再也不想你见到那个女孩了。我想成为你的女朋友，我们该开始约会。我觉得我们应该这么做，”我吞咽着，羞愧于我没有勇气当面说这些。

In the past, when I have, I've always made sure to make a spectacle of it, you know? I'd make sure that everyone was watching and witnessing this goddess condescend to whatever idiot it happened to be, but this time… This is messy. This is wrong. This isn't the way you're supposed to ask people out.  
过去，我总是确保场面宏大，你知道吗？我会确保每个人都看着，见证这位女神屈尊于任何一个蠢货，但这次……这很混乱。这是错的。这不是你该向人表白的方式。

I wish I could rewind time and take my words back. Or hell, just not drink so much in the first place, because I was jealous of some tramp who thought she-  
我真希望能让时间倒流，收回我的话。或者干脆，一开始就别喝那么多，因为我嫉妒某个自以为是的女人——

"Yeah, okay," Shinji says, beyond the shower.  
“嗯，好吧，”真嗣在浴室外说道。

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Yeah, let's date," he says. "I think it's a good idea, Asuka."  
“好啊，我们交往吧，”他说，“我觉得这是个好主意，明日香。”

There are too many emotions happening in my head right now for me to even calculate what the fuck is happening.  
我脑子里现在情绪太多，连到底发生了什么都算不清楚。

"So we're dating now?" I ask.  
"所以我们现在是在约会了？" 我问道。

"Yeah, I guess so." "嗯，我想是的。"

There's another long silence, as all of these words sink in on both sides of the thin, decisive, dividing wall of the shower.  
又是一阵漫长的沉默，所有这些话语在狭小、决定性、分隔浴室的薄墙两侧慢慢沉淀。

What do I do now? I'm supposed to say something, right? Do I try and be sexy? I don't feel very sexy right now, I feel the opposite of it.  
我现在该怎么办？我应该说点什么，对吧？我要试着性感一点吗？我现在感觉一点也不性感，恰恰相反。

I just feel like… a nice, spreading warmth in my chest, but it's one I don't know how to translate into words.  
我只觉得……胸口涌起一股温暖，但这种感觉我不知如何用言语表达。

So I say: "…cool." 于是我说：“……酷。”

"Yeah, cool." He clears his throat, "do you need any other help? You sound more… there, than before."  
"是啊，挺好的。" 他清了清嗓子，"你还需要别的帮助吗？你听起来比之前更有精神了。"

"Yeah, I think I'm alright now. Thank you, Shinji."  
"嗯，我想我现在没事了。谢谢你，真嗣。"

I can picture his smile. I know he likes when I say his name like that.  
我能想象出他的微笑。我知道他喜欢我那样叫他的名字。

"I'll talk to you in the morning. Feel better, Asuka," he says. "Goodnight," and he steps out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him.  
"明早再聊。希望你感觉好些，明日香。" 他说道，"晚安。" 随后他走出了浴室，轻轻关上了门。

There goes my idiot roommate. My _boyfriend_. The word feels new in my mind, unlike anything I've ever felt, even though I've had my share of boyfriends. This boyfriend is Shinji. That makes it... you know, different.  
我的傻瓜室友走了。我的男朋友。这个词在我脑海中感觉新鲜，与我以往任何感受都不同，尽管我也有过几任男友。这位男朋友是真嗣。这就让一切...你知道的，变得不同了。

…

Oh god, what have I just done?  
哦天哪，我刚刚做了什么？

_AN: First of all, thank you for reading so far. We're actually about to get into the meat of what I wanted to do when this whole thing began, which is to actually examine how these two fuck-ups (both of whom I love unconditionally) actually work in a relationship together under relatively normal and healthy circumstances. Well, as normal and healthy as things can be in an Eva fic, anyway. Haha!  
作者的话：首先，感谢大家阅读到这里。我们即将进入我最初构思这部作品的核心部分，即探讨这两个糊涂蛋（我无条件爱他们）如何在相对正常和健康的环境下维系一段关系。当然，在 Eva 同人文中，所谓的正常和健康也是相对而言的。哈哈！_

_Second of all, shoutouts to anyone and everyone who answered the First Ever Unofficial Hidinginplainsight Music Survey. Some of you even wrote PMs in, which is incredible, and are always fun to answer. There was no consensus at all, except the consensus that we all had awful high school experiences that we had to turn to music to cure, which wasn't as much of a revelation to me as much as a soothing reaffirmation of truth. Also, someone mentioned Queens of the Stone Age, and I was also happy to know I wasn't the only weirdo who obsessed over Josh Homme's every word. You're all beautiful people.  
其次，向所有参与首届非官方 Hidinginplainsight 音乐调查的朋友们致谢。有些人甚至私信给我，这真是太棒了，回复起来也总是很有趣。虽然大家的意见不一，但有一个共识是，我们都曾在糟糕的高中经历中寻求音乐的慰藉，这对我来说与其说是新发现，不如说是一种令人安心的真理重申。此外，有人提到了石器时代女王乐队，我很高兴知道我不是唯一一个对乔什·霍姆的每一句话都着迷的怪人。你们都是美好的人。_

_In other news, my most recommended movies right now are: 'Mad Max Fury Road' (2015) really guys, please see it, 'Alien' (1979) I just bought the Quadrilogy on bluray and haven't slept well since, and the Swedish movie 'Force Majeure' (2014), which used the Best Cry Ever to actually make me cry, and never stops being surprising, funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.  
其他消息方面，我目前最推荐的影片有：《疯狂的麦克斯：狂暴之路》（2015 年），真的，大家一定要看；《异形》（1979 年），我刚买了蓝光四部曲，自此夜不能寐；还有瑞典电影《不可抗力》（2014 年），它用史上最佳哭泣镜头实实在在地让我落泪，且始终充满惊喜、幽默与心碎。_

_If we're making this a running gag, the survey for this chapter is: What's the last movie you saw that you can't wait to watch again? I just recommended mine, so get crackin' guys.  
如果我们要把这个做成一个持续的笑点，那么本章的调查问卷是：你最近看的那部迫不及待想重看的电影是什么？我刚推荐了我的，所以大家快行动起来吧。_

_Thank you so much for reading this far and for dealing with my slightly-too-long-and-tonally-inconsistent Authors Notes. I don't have a blog, I apologize. Hope you are enjoying the story.  
非常感谢您读到这里，并忍受我稍显冗长且语调不一的作者笔记。我没有博客，对此我深表歉意。希望您能享受这个故事。_

### Chapter 4
_AN: Just a quick heads-up, there's gonna be some sexy stuff in this chapter. Sexy sexy sexy stuff. Oooh. So sexy. I've upgraded the fic to an M accordingly.  
作者的话：先提醒一下，这一章会有一些香艳的内容。非常非常性感的东西。哦哦哦。太性感了。因此我相应地将小说评级提升至 M 级。  
__So if you're not down with that, you should bail out now, and just imagine it yourself.  
所以如果你不接受这些，现在就该退出，自己想象一下吧。  
__I know you do, don't lie to me.  
我知道你会的，别对我撒谎。_

"There's nothing you and I won't do,  
"“你我之间，无所不能，”  
I'll stop the world and melt with you."  
我要让世界停转，与你融化其中。

The first time I kissed Asuka Langley Sohryu, it was disastrous, and it ruined my confidence with women for the next three or so years.  
第一次亲吻惣流·明日香·兰格雷时，那是一场灾难，接下来的三四年里，它摧毁了我对女性的信心。

The second time I kissed her, it was pouring and neither of us had brought umbrellas to class.  
第二次吻她时，天正下着倾盆大雨，我们俩都没带伞去上课。

"Gott verdammt!" the redhead next to me yells, soaking wet from head to foot. My _girlfriend_.  
“该死！”我旁边的红发女孩大喊，从头到脚湿透了。我的女朋友。

Huh. That still feels new.  
哈，这感觉还是那么新鲜。

Right now, however, she's my angry girlfriend. "The one time we didn't bring umbrellas! I _told_ you to pack it, but noooo!" She places her hand over her chest and cocks a hip to the side. "Look, I'm Shinji, and I have faith in _the damn weather forecast!"_  
不过眼下，她是我那生气的女朋友。“就这一次我们没带伞！我告诉过你要打包的，可你就是不听！”她把手放在胸前，侧身翘起一只脚。“看，我是真嗣，我居然还相信那该死的天气预报！”

She kicks the small water puddle on the ground, splashing both of our shins. Not that either of us could get any wetter. I shake my head and sigh.  
她踢了踢地上的小水坑，溅得我们俩小腿都是水。其实我们俩已经湿透了。我摇摇头，叹了口气。

"I don't even think they use this bus stop anymore. We're probably stuck here until this rain lets up."  
“我甚至觉得这个公交车站已经没人用了。我们可能得一直待在这儿，直到雨停。”

Asuka lets out a guffaw to my left, fishing around in her bag for her cigarettes.  
明日香在我左边发出一阵大笑，伸手在包里摸索她的香烟。

"Yeah, well it sure ain't my fault, ace. '30% chance' my ass. I could have told you it was going to rain when we left this morning. I did tell you, in point of fact. Dunno if I mentioned that." Bringing her hand out, the stares ruefully at the carton, dyed a deep tobacco color by the water. "Oh _come on_!"  
“是啊，反正不是我的错，王牌。‘30%的几率’，见鬼去吧。我今早出门时就告诉过你会下雨。实际上，我确实提醒过你。不知道我有没有提到过。”她把手抽出来，无奈地看着那盒被雨水浸透成深棕色的香烟，“哦，别这样！”

I watched the Marlboros sail out into the rainy abyss with a dark sort of satisfaction.  
我看着万宝路香烟消失在雨幕中，心中涌起一种阴暗的满足感。

Next to me, Asuka crosses her arms over her chest, falling back against the wall. "Great. Just great…"  
在我旁边，明日香双臂交叉抱在胸前，向后靠在墙上。“太好了。真是太好了……”

I turn my head away, so she doesn't see the smile spreading across my face. It'll only piss her off more.  
我转过头去，不让她看到我脸上逐渐展开的笑容。那只会让她更加恼火。

I would never tell her, but the more time has gone on, the more I've realized that Asuka is spectacularly beautiful when angry. Not _deeply_ angry, per se, but fired up for sure. That's when her eyes spark at their most fiercely intelligent. Her brow creases down and it frames everything just… angelically. I don't know, I've never understood it. The older I get, the more I'm attracted to stronger women. It's something to do with parent issues, I'm sure. I've sure got a lot of those kicking around after all these years.  
我永远不会告诉她，但随着时间的推移，我越来越意识到明日香在生气时格外美丽。并非深怒，确切地说，但肯定是情绪高涨。那时她的眼睛闪烁着最炽热的智慧光芒。她的眉头紧皱，这一切都显得如此……天使般。我不知道，我从未理解过。年纪越大，我对更强势的女性越有吸引力。这肯定与父母的问题有关。毕竟这么多年过去了，我确实有很多这样的问题在身边徘徊。

I pat her on the shoulder, and give it a little squeeze. "It's been raining for a while now, I'm sure this will all blow over soon."  
我轻轻拍了拍她的肩膀，稍微用力捏了一下。“已经下了好一阵子雨了，我相信这一切很快就会过去的。”

"Yeah…" she mumbles, but she doesn't sound convinced. My hand lingers on her shoulder, and I feel it start to tremble a little.  
“是啊……”她咕哝着，但听起来并不信服。我的手还搭在她的肩上，感觉到它开始微微颤抖。

I cock an eyebrow at her. "You okay?"  
我挑起一边眉毛看着她。“你还好吗？”

"Yeah, I'm fine. It's just… you know," she shrugs, her shoulders shaking, "colder than I thought it would be."  
"嗯，我没事。只是……你知道的，"她耸耸肩，肩膀微微颤抖，"比我想象的要冷。"

"You know,I told _you_ to bring your jacket this morning."  
"你知道吗，我今早叫你带上外套的。"

"Oh, shut up," Asuka taps my foot with hers, and falls silent.  
"哦，闭嘴，"明日香用她的脚轻轻踢了我的脚一下，然后沉默了。"

The sound of rain on the tin roof over us gives me the impression that we're the only two people in the world. The stop is at a bend in the road, on a hill, with green branches framing the road, now several shades darker than their usual hue. A car passes slowly on the opposite us, and then there's only us and the water hitting the shelter over our heads.  
雨点敲打在我们头顶的锡皮屋顶上，让我有种错觉，仿佛这世界上只剩下我们两个人。停车处位于道路拐弯的上坡，绿枝环绕，此刻比平日里深了几分。一辆车缓缓从对面驶过，随后便只剩下我们和头顶遮蔽物上落下的水珠。

With a soft shuffle, I feel the gentle weight of Asuka leaning against me, and I wrap an arm firmly around her shoulder, tugging her to my side.  
随着轻轻的摩擦声，我感觉到明日香温柔地靠在我身上，我便用一只手臂紧紧搂住她的肩膀，将她拉近我身边。

It's been more of this lately for us. Ever since the night we began, it's been… tentative. Warm, but I think we're both still a little confused who we are around each other now. She was certainly right about dating changing things; I measure my words a little more now. I'm still unsure how forward I can be.  
最近我们之间更多的是这样。自从那个夜晚开始，一切就变得……小心翼翼。温暖，但我想我们俩都还在困惑彼此间的新身份。她确实说对了，约会改变了事情；我现在说话更加斟酌。我仍不确定自己能有多主动。

But that being said, any awkwardness has been outweighed by the perks. We've been holding hands a lot, though I think on some level she's still kind of shy about people _seeing_ us hold hands. Except for Hitomi. She always makes sure to grab my hand when that poor girl is in eyeshot. Cuddling has gone up, and I've enjoyed that quite a bit. We were on the couch the other night, and she actually fell asleep on my chest. It was nice, it was just… us. The way I thought it would be, all along. Comfortable.  
但话虽如此，任何尴尬都被这些好处所抵消。我们牵手很多次，尽管在某种程度上她仍然对别人看到我们牵手感到有些害羞。除了瞳。每当那个可怜的女孩进入视线范围时，她总是确保抓住我的手。拥抱的次数增加了，我非常享受这一点。前两天晚上我们在沙发上，她竟然在我的胸口睡着了。感觉很好，只有……我们俩。我一直想象中的那种舒适。

Asuka places her head against me and sighs.  
明日香把头靠在我身上，叹了口气。

"I'm not really angry," she mutters, "you know that, right? I'm just annoyed."  
“我并不是真的生气，”她低声说，“你知道这一点，对吧？我只是有点烦。”

"Yeah, I know," I chuckle, "we may have just started dating, but I've known you quite a while. I can tell the difference."  
"是啊，我知道，" 我轻笑道，"虽然我们才刚开始交往，但我认识你已经有一段时间了。我能分辨出来。"

She nudges her finger into my side, playfully, and then settles against me. She's trying to get warm, I assume.  
她用手指轻轻戳了戳我的侧腰，调皮地，然后靠在我身上。我想她是在试着取暖。

"What are you thinking about?" she asks, which is also 'a thing' now, I guess. Ever since that night, Asuka seems increasingly earnest about knowing what's happening in my head at any given moment. Haven't figured out what _that's_ all about yet, because sometimes the answer has been… well, not much at all. I'd been thinking about classes, or what to make for dinner that night. Domestic stuff. Uninteresting, largely, but she always listens, which is also different.  
"你在想什么呢？" 她问道，这似乎也成了现在的一种常态。自从那个晚上以来，明日香似乎越来越想知道我脑子里在想什么。我还没弄清楚这是怎么回事，因为有时候答案是……嗯，没什么特别的。我可能在想课程，或者那天晚上做什么晚餐。都是些家常琐事，大多无趣，但她总是认真听着，这也和以前不同了。

"Nothing really. The rain, and all that." I look down at her, "You know, actually, I was sort of wondering… "  
“没什么特别的。就是雨，还有那些。” 我低头看着她，“你知道吗，其实，我有点好奇……”

And I trail off, because I hadn't realized until this moment how truly close her face was to mine. I can feel the warmth of her breath on my skin, blazing hot when contrasted with the dampness of our clothing. I see the slight pattern of freckles across her nose, which I always forget are there. I think she's embarrassed by them, perceiving them as somehow childish, but I've always thought they accentuated everything very nicely. And that blue, of course. The blue I could just fall into forever.  
我话音渐弱，因为直到此刻我才意识到她的脸离我有多近。我能感受到她呼吸的热度拂过我的肌肤，与湿漉漉的衣物形成鲜明对比，炽热无比。我看到了她鼻梁上淡淡的雀斑，这些我总是忘记它们的存在。我想她可能因为觉得它们显得幼稚而感到尴尬，但我一直认为它们恰到好处地衬托了一切。当然，还有那蓝色，那蓝色让我仿佛可以永远沉溺其中。

Her eyes, however, betray turmoil underneath. Even if there's nothing going on in my head, it seems that at any given moment Asuka is thinking about entirely too much. Her eyes dart back and forth nervously to mine, trying to read my expression, asking for… permission? She's worried. Something's worrying her.  
然而，她的眼神却透露出内心的纷乱。即使我脑海中一片空白，似乎在任何时刻，明日香都在思考着太多的事情。她的目光紧张地在我脸上游移，试图解读我的表情，寻求……许可？她在担心。有什么事情让她忧心忡忡。

Why is she worried? 她为何担忧？

Why would I worry her? What could she possibly -?  
我怎会让她担心？她可能会有什么——？

And then, before my mind can dissuade me from doing so, I lean down and press my lips against hers. A soft gasp escapes her lips before we connect, and there's a second of stillness in her body before I feel her sigh, and melt against me.  
然后，在我脑海中的理智阻止我之前，我俯下身，轻轻吻上了她的唇。在我们接触之前，她发出了一声轻柔的惊呼，她的身体有一瞬间的静止，随后我感觉到她的叹息，并在我怀中融化。

She's accepting it. She wanted this, too. It's with surprise I feel her tongue probe at my mouth, but I let it in gladly. That never happened the first time around, and the sensation is nearly overwhelming. I've wanted this for so long, I can't even remember a time when I didn't.  
她接受了。她也渴望这个。我惊讶地感觉到她的舌头探入我的唇间，但我欣然接纳。第一次并没有发生这样的事，这种感觉几乎让我无法承受。我渴望这一刻已经太久，久到记不清何时开始。

She wraps her arms around my back, and for several minutes, we're completely alone.  
她用双臂环抱住我的背，在接下来的几分钟里，我们完全独处。

And the moment is ours.  
这一刻，只属于我们。

And it will be forever.  
而这份情感将永恒不变。

That was kiss two. 那是第二个吻。

If there were a wall between us, it was fractured with our second first-kiss, but it wasn't broken down completely.  
即使我们之间有一堵墙，在第二次初吻时它已裂痕累累，但尚未完全崩塌。

The break came somewhat later.  
转机稍后才出现。

A month after the fact, I'm settling in bed for the night when light floods the room, and I see Asuka in the doorway.  
事情发生一个月后，我正准备上床睡觉，房间突然被光照亮，我看到明日香站在门口。

"Move over," she whispers, laying herself next to me on the bed. It's not exactly one designed for two people, but I think that's also sort of the appeal right now. Cuddling and human touch and all that. She tries to relax, and pulls the sheets so they're mostly over herself.  
“挪一下。”她轻声说，躺在我旁边的床上。这张床并不适合两个人睡，但我觉得这正是现在的魅力所在。拥抱、人体接触之类的一切。她试图放松，拉过被子，大部分盖在自己身上。

A long beat of silence, before she shifts again, uncomfortably.  
长时间的沉默后，她再次不安地挪动了一下。

"Come on, Ikari, how much room do you take up, anyway?"  
“来吧，碇，你到底占了多少地方？”

"…I'm actually halfway off of the bed."  
“……我其实已经半边身子悬在床外了。”

She scoffs. "That's because you're not touching me."  
她嗤之以鼻。“那是因为你没碰我。”

Dunno how to respond to that exactly.  
不知道该怎么确切回应。

"I mean…" “我是说……”

She glances over at me in the dark. "What's the problem?"  
她在黑暗中瞥了我一眼。“怎么了？”

"Well," I lick my lips, choosing my words carefully. She had on a maximum of two pieces of clothing – the top one being far too loose and the bottom one being far too tight. It was a dangerous combination, even in reduced light. For my part, I had always slept in just the boxer shorts I adopted at seventeen. So between us we had three things being worn. Not exactly school-appropriate attire. "…you're barely wearing anything, Asuka."  
“嗯，”我舔了舔嘴唇，斟酌着用词。她身上最多只穿了两件衣服——上面那件过于宽松，下面那件又过于紧绷。即使在昏暗的光线下，这也是个危险的组合。至于我，我一直只穿着十七岁时开始穿的那条平角裤睡觉。所以我们俩加起来总共只穿了三件。这可算不上是学校里适合的着装。“……你几乎没穿什么，明日香。”

"And what, that disgusts you? Come on…" her voice softens in the dark, "I didn't think that dating would just be holding hands and kissing."  
“那又怎样，这让你反感吗？拜托……”她在黑暗中声音柔和了下来，“我没想到约会就只是牵手和亲吻。”

My heart literally just stopped.  
我的心简直停跳了一拍。

"N-not _tonight_, of course!" She trips over words, trying to backtrack. "But… you know. I'm not, like… offended if you want to… touch things…"  
"今、今晚当然不行！" 她结结巴巴地试图收回话。"但是…你知道的。我并不…如果你想要…触碰东西…我不会介意的…"

There was dead silence in the room.  
房间里一片死寂。

Is that an invitation? I can't tell exactly how many things I'm allowed to touch, or in what capacity. Or when, or where, or how. Is Asuka the kind of person that would like me to just take the lead and be assertive or would she find that threatening? For as long as we've cohabitated, we've never spoken openly about sexual likes or dislikes, so I'm literally flying blind.  
这是在邀请我吗？我实在搞不清自己究竟能触碰多少东西，以及以何种程度、何时、何地、如何触碰。明日香是属于那种喜欢我主动出击、表现得自信满满的人，还是会觉得这样有威胁感呢？尽管我们同居已久，却从未开诚布公地谈过性方面的喜好或厌恶，所以我真的是在盲目飞行。

Of course, that's if she even means '_touch me_' touch me. She might just mean embracing, but she's being very obtuse about it if she is.  
当然，如果她说的‘触碰我’真的是指那个意思的话。她可能只是想拥抱，但如果真是这样，她表现得也太含糊其辞了。

Regardless, I've been staring at her for the better part of a minute now, and I make sure to shuffle back towards her on the bed. Grabbing my arm, she pulls me into a spooning position, and places the blankets over the both of us. Spooning is literally the only way we're both going to fit on the bed, a bed that I had never considered 'small' until precisely this moment, and it's not at all unpleasant.  
无论如何，我已经盯着她看了将近一分钟，确保自己挪回床上靠近她。她抓住我的手臂，把我拉进一个抱抱的姿势，并为我们俩盖上毯子。抱抱是我们俩唯一能在这张床上舒适共处的方式，这张床我从未觉得‘小’，直到此刻才意识到，而且这种感觉一点也不坏。

I let out a sigh and settle in, making sure to keep my hips just slightly disconnected from her bottom, which I'm all-too-painfully-aware is only separated from me by my boxers, and the very thin garment that she's wearing. Whatever you call it. I'm trying not to think too hard about her body right now.  
我叹了口气，调整了一下姿势，确保我的臀部只是微微与她的臀部保持距离，尽管我清楚地知道我们之间只隔着我的内裤和她那件薄薄的衣物。随便你怎么称呼它。我现在尽量不去过多地想她的身体。

I shut my eyes and try to concentrate on literally anything else. I have a test tomorrow morning for European History, and I was actually meaning to ask her about it. I've never been very good with that stuff, and I'd bet quite a bit that she knows more about it than-  
我闭上眼睛，试图集中注意力在任何其他事情上。明天早上我有一场欧洲历史的考试，我原本还想向她请教来着。我对这些知识一直不太擅长，我敢打赌她对此的了解肯定比我多——

With a gentle nudge, Asuka pushes her ass into the front of my waist. The monster. I'm literally at the edge of the bed – there's nowhere more I can retreat to.  
阿斯 uka 轻轻一顶，她的臀部便贴上了我的腰。这个磨人的小妖精。我已经在床边了——再没有退路了。

Literally anything else. Don't think about this. _Anything else at all_.  
任何其他事情都行。别去想这个。任何其他事情都可以。

Which doesn't work. With absolute helplessness, I feel myself grow stiff against her.  
但这并没有用。我感到自己无助地在她身边变得僵硬。

I wince in the dark, holding my breath. She's going to feel it, and she's going to storm out of the room, I'm sure of it. This will be the end – the Asuka rage storm to end them all. I grit my teeth and expect the worst.  
我在黑暗中皱眉，屏住呼吸。她肯定会感觉到，然后怒气冲冲地离开房间，我确信这一点。这将是一切的终结——终结一切的明日香怒火风暴。我咬紧牙关，准备迎接最坏的情况。

But that doesn't happen. It's several moments before I realize that Asuka is holding her breath as well. What is she doing?  
但这种情况并未发生。过了好一会儿，我才意识到明日香也在屏住呼吸。她在做什么呢？

Maybe… she's waiting to see what I'll do about it? She's facing away from me, but even if I could see her face, I wouldn't be entirely sure how to proceed, if she wanted it. How can you tell if a girl is horny, anyway? I've never been good at picking up on those signals, but she does have a point: if we're truly dating now, things like this are certainly on the table. Hell, it's half the reason most people get into relationships at all.  
也许……她在等着看我会怎么处理？她背对着我，但即便我能看到她的脸，我也不完全确定如果她想要的话该如何继续。毕竟，你怎么能判断一个女孩是否欲火中烧呢？我向来不擅长捕捉这些信号，但她确实有道理：如果我们现在真的在交往，这类事情自然也在考虑范围内。见鬼，这几乎是大多数人谈恋爱的半数原因。

She's still here. She still hasn't moved. She's still waiting.  
她还在这里。她依然没有动。她还在等待。

With my heart pounding like a drum in my chest, I gently slide my hand up to the most southward hem of her shirt – it's one of those soft, oversized ones they sell to girls to sleep in. Like Victoria's Secret or something. I wash it every week, but right now there's nothing on my mind except my hand, and its proximity to her naked skin underneath that shirt.  
我的心跳如鼓点般在胸腔内狂跳，我轻轻地将手滑向她衬衫最南端的下摆——那是她们用来睡觉的柔软、 oversized 的款式，像是维多利亚的秘密之类的东西。我每周都会洗它，但此刻我的脑海中除了我的手，以及它与她衬衫下裸露肌肤的接近，别无他念。

This is the moment of no return. I could ruin everything right here.  
这是无法回头的时刻。我可能会在这里毁掉一切。

Oh, please don't let me ruin everything…  
哦，请不要让我毁掉一切…

After several seconds of steeling myself, I slide my hand under the shirt, and start inching it up her stomach.  
在鼓足了几秒钟的勇气后，我把手滑进她的衬衫下，开始缓缓向上推起她的衣摆。

Her skin is molten hot underneath my fingers, and smoother than I'd ever imagined. For the amount of beer she drinks, her stomach is surprisingly taut. I find the gentle dip of her navel and trace a circle around it in wonder, which prompts her to laugh softly. My hand freezes.  
她的肌肤在我指尖下滚烫如熔岩，比我想象中还要光滑。尽管她喝了不少啤酒，腹部却出奇地紧实。我找到了她肚脐那温柔的凹陷，好奇地绕着它画圈，这让她轻声笑了起来。我的手顿时僵住了。

"What?" I whisper, terrified.  
“怎么了？”我低声问道，心中充满恐惧。

"It's nothing, it just tickled," she says back, and there's a smile in her voice. She wets her lips. "You can keep going, you know. If you want."  
"没什么，只是有点痒，"她回道，声音里带着笑意。她舔了舔嘴唇。"你可以继续，你知道的。如果你想的话。"

"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"

She presses herself slightly more against my boxers. "Positive."  
她更紧地贴在我的内裤上。"当然。"

Wow.

Okay, wow. 好吧，哇。

This is happening. This is literally every high school fantasy I've ever had, and it's happening right here, at this exact moment. I'm not entirely sure how to process it.  
这真的发生了。这简直是我所有高中幻想的现实版，就在此时此地，实实在在地发生了。我完全不知道该如何应对。

My hand continues its journey up her stomach, until I start to feel her skin swell outwards, and this is territory that I'm truly afraid of now. I've seen her breasts once, but they've certainly changed since then, and the memory of that moment remains a poisonous one to me. I don't know if I'm ready to confront that yet.  
我的手继续向上游走，直到触及她腹部肌肤向外膨胀的部分，这片领域让我真正感到害怕。我曾见过她的胸部，但自那以后肯定有所变化，那段记忆对我来说依然如毒药般挥之不去。我不知道自己是否准备好再次面对。

_She gave you permission, though,_ says the part of my brain that I wish spoke more often.  
她确实给了你许可，虽然这部分大脑我希望它更常说话。

I… maybe I'm misunderstanding.  
我……也许是我理解错了。

_Come on, Shinji. If that wasn't a written invitation, then I don't really know what is.  
拜托，真嗣。如果那都不算书面邀请，那我真的不知道什么才算了。_

I'm still hesitant. This is a big moment for me.  
我仍然犹豫不决。对我来说，这是一个重大的时刻。

Asuka shifts somewhat uncomfortably in my arms.  
明日香在我怀里略显不安地动了动。

"…Shinji?" she whispers, "We uh… we don't have to go further if you're not… if it makes you uncomfortable. I," she gropes for words, "that really wasn't my intention. We can take things slower, if you want, I just thought that you would-"  
“…真嗣？”她低声说道，“我们…呃…如果你不…如果你觉得不舒服，我们不必继续下去。我，”她寻找着合适的词句，“我真的不是那个意思。如果你愿意，我们可以放慢节奏，我只是以为你会…”

Ah, fuck it. 啊，去他的。

My hand slides down her stomach, past her navel and her waist and down the front of her underwear, eliciting a moan from her that I never thought I'd hear. She arches her back against me, pressing herself even more firmly into my front, causing friction against my already beleaguered penis.  
我的手滑过她的腹部，越过她的肚脐和腰际，探向前她的内裤，引得她发出一声我从未料想能听到的呻吟。她背对着我弓起身子，更加紧贴我的前身，摩擦着我早已不堪重负的阴茎。

Oh, wow, she's… 哦，哇，她真是……

She's actually very wet. That was not what I was expecting. I move my fingers around to get a better angle and I feel Asuka squirm, moaning again. It was a little louder this time.  
她其实非常湿润。这完全出乎我的意料。我移动手指寻找更好的角度，感觉到明日香扭动身体，再次发出呻吟。这次声音稍微大了一些。

I could… do this to her? The thought of me could? No, that's impossible. There's no way that I could possibly-  
我……能对她这么做吗？我可能吗？不，这不可能。我绝不可能做到——

Reaching back, she loops her arm around my head and brings my mouth into hers. There's a _need_ in the kiss. A tacit exclamation, imploring me not to stop whatever it is I'm doing down there.  
她回过头，手臂绕过我的头，将我的嘴拉向她的。这个吻中带着迫切。一种无声的呼喊，恳求我不要停止正在对她做的任何事情。

So I don't. 所以我没这么做。

She's only making vowel sounds now. They're not even words and they're the most erotic thing I've ever heard in my life.  
她现在只能发出元音声。这些甚至算不上是词语，却是我一生中听过的最撩人的声音。

As my fingers pick up speed, so does Asuka's writhing against me. She's… she's going to put a quick end to me if she keeps making that noise and moving like that, but I couldn't care less right now. There's nothing in my brain at all except for her.  
随着我的手指加快动作，明日香在我身上扭动的幅度也加大了。她……如果她继续发出那种声音并那样移动，会让我很快缴械，但我现在根本不在乎。我的脑海中除了她什么都没有。

Asuka Langley Sohryu wants me. She's my girlfriend and she _wants_ me. The very thought is overwhelming, on top of the heat and her tongue in my mouth and the feeling of parts of her I never dreamed I would actually ever encounter. Her hair and her eyes and the sound of her voice when she-  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷想要我。她是我的女朋友，她想要我。这个念头本身就令人难以承受，再加上这股热浪、她在我口中的舌尖，以及那些我从未梦想过会实际接触到的她的身体部位。她的发丝、她的眼眸，还有她声音中的那种感觉，当她——

"Oh, god, stop! Shinji, stop for just a second!" she says, pulling away slightly, which is disappointing to say the least. The last thing I want to happen right now is 'stop'.  
“哦，天哪，停下！真嗣，停一下！”她说着，稍稍拉开距离，这至少可以说是令人失望的。现在我最不希望发生的就是‘停下’。

She removes my hand from her front and pushes me onto my back, climbing on top of me and putting her face near mine. We're both out of breath from the encounter, and for several moments, I see her studying me. Her eyes are darting again, more silent gears are turning as this brilliant, beautiful woman weighs options in her head. I can't possibly imagine what she's thinking.  
她把我的手从她身前移开，把我推倒仰面躺下，然后爬到我身上，把脸凑近我。我们俩都因刚才的接触而气喘吁吁，有好一会儿，我看到她在仔细打量我。她的目光又在游移，更多的无声齿轮在转动，这位聪明美丽的女人正在脑海中权衡各种选择。我无法想象她在想些什么。

After several seconds, she grins devilishly.  
几秒钟后，她狡黠地笑了。

"There's no way in hell you're gonna make me cum first. I'd never give you the satisfaction." She presses a finger against my nose, and smiles more gently, and murmurs "Baka-Shinji," before planting soft kiss on my lips.  
“想让我先高潮？门都没有。我才不会让你得逞。”她用手指轻触我的鼻子，笑容柔和了些，低声呢喃着“笨蛋真嗣”，随后在我唇上轻轻一吻。

And then she's kissing her way down my front.  
接着，她开始从我胸前一路吻下。

And then she's taking my boxers off.  
然后她开始脱我的内裤。

And her pride remains intact, which I'm only somewhat embarrassed to say takes very little time at all.  
而她的骄傲依旧完好无损，我只能略带尴尬地说，这几乎不费什么时间。

---

Then the floodgates were open, and not just the carnal things, either.  
接着，情感的闸门也被打开，不仅仅是肉体上的。

It's funny how when you start to become physically intimate with another person you start to open up in all sorts of ways. It's just little things – you hold each other's gaze more easily, you start to have inside jokes, you just… you _know_ them more, strangely. If you're doing it right, anyway. I hooked up with someone once, near the end of high school, and that didn't have the same effect at all. It just made me feel used and discarded.  
有趣的是，当你开始与另一个人变得身体亲密时，你也会以各种方式敞开心扉。只是些小事——你们更容易凝视对方，开始有了内部笑话，就是……你更了解他们了，奇怪的是。如果做得对的话，至少我是这么觉得。我曾在高中快结束时和某人短暂交往过，但那完全没有同样的效果。只让我感到被利用和抛弃。

I don't know. Some people can make it work, I suppose, but I've never been one of them. Once was enough for me to know I didn't like it.  
我不知道。有些人或许能处理好，但我从来不是其中之一。一次就足以让我明白我不喜欢那样。

Being in bed with someone, you realize, is just an extension of being with that person – their personality translates to what they're like to have a sexual encounter with.  
和某人躺在床上，你会发现，这只是与那个人相处的一种延伸——他们的个性会转化为他们在性爱中的表现。

For example, Asuka can be very aggressive, but she's also… very caring actually. And strangely talkative. She asks if she's going too far, she asks if you like things, she backs off quickly if you're not enjoying something, and so on. There's no sense that you're being used for pleasure, only the sense that she's actually interested in you. Me, I suppose. It feels like a gift.  
比如说，明日香可能非常强势，但她其实也非常关心人。而且出奇地健谈。她会问自己是否做得太过，会问你是否喜欢某些事，如果你不喜欢，她会很快退让，诸如此类。没有被利用来取乐的感觉，只有她真的对你感兴趣的感觉。对我来说，我想。这感觉像是一种礼物。

Maybe I'm just pontificating though. We haven't had sex yet, which is a little strange, but I'm more than happy to take things at the pace she wants to.  
或许我只是在这里空谈。我们还没发生过性关系，这有点奇怪，但我很乐意按照她的节奏来。

Besides, I've discovered that I have quite a gift for going down on her, which I've been getting a lot of mileage out of. If we had just jumped right into sex, I don't know if I ever would have felt her hands on the back of my head of heard her voice fill a room like that. It's quite… intoxicating, actually. There are nights I find I relish it more than she does. Well, I enjoy her _enjoyment_ of it, anyway.  
此外，我发现自己在给她口交方面颇有天赋，这让我受益匪浅。如果我们直接跳到性行为，我不知道自己是否还能感受到她双手按在我头后的感觉，或是听到她的声音那样充满整个房间。这真的很……令人陶醉，实际上。有些夜晚，我发现我比她更享受这个过程。好吧，至少我享受她对此的享受。

I… I feel myself falling in love with her. _Really_ falling, I mean, not just being attracted to, and it's scary, because for the first time I know what she was talking about outside of the bar all those eons ago.  
我…我感觉自己真的爱上了她。真的是在坠入爱河，我的意思是，不仅仅是被吸引，这让我感到害怕，因为这是我第一次明白她很久以前在酒吧外所说的那些话。

Because this must be the 'honeymoon phase', and the sinking feeling in my stomach is me wondering will happen when the honeymoon is over.  
因为这一定是所谓的‘蜜月期’，而我胃里的下沉感让我不禁思考，当蜜月结束时会发生什么。

---

_AN: Welcome to Chapter 4, in which things get sexy and hopefully not gratuitously so. Which is to say that if these two started actually dating, this would probably be one of the biggest immediate changes for them, and is worth talking about. I once had someone describe a significant other as "A best friend who you make out with," which is only somewhat true, but on point for here, inasmuch as it's the 'making out' part that designates a difference.  
作者注：欢迎来到第四章，这一章事情变得性感，希望不会过于露骨。也就是说，如果这两个人真的开始约会，这可能是他们最大的即时变化之一，值得讨论。我曾经听人形容另一半为“一个和你亲热的最好的朋友”，虽然不完全准确，但在这里，正是‘亲热’这一部分标志着差异。_

_Anyway. There's gonna be more of that and I'll try to keep it to the 'not just a lemon' side of the tracks as much as I can. No promises. I'm an awful person.  
总之。这种情节还会有更多，我会尽量保持在‘不只是柠檬’的那一边。不保证。我是个糟糕的人。_

_In answering last chapter's question - Clockwork Orange is a great choice, though I think Full Metal Jacket might be my absolute fave Kubrick. Either way, I get being floored by the filmmaking prowess on display. Summer Wars is such a terrific film and I'm a little enamored with Natsuki for sure. Also, major ups to Sadamoto for designing these two lovely balls of issues that I've written so much about. And finally, for 'Screaming With Your Mouth Shut', I can only say eeeeEEEEVERYBUDDY GETUP; IT'S TIME TO SLAM NOW. WE GOT A REAL JAM GOIN DOWN._ _WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM. I think you won, buddy, bc you made me pull up that song on YouTube and it annoyed my roommate quite a bit. Keep on keepin' on, Screaming._  
回答上一章的问题——《发条橙》是个不错的选择，但我觉得《全金属外壳》可能是我最喜欢的库布里克电影。无论如何，我理解被展现的电影制作技艺所震撼的感觉。《夏日大作战》是一部极好的电影，我确实有点迷恋夏希。此外，要大大感谢贞本义行为我写了这么多关于这两个问题人物的设计。最后，对于‘闭嘴尖叫’，我只能说，大家快起来；是时候震撼全场了。我们有一个真正的即兴演奏正在进行。欢迎来到太空大灌篮。我想你赢了，伙计，因为你让我在 YouTube 上找了那首歌，结果吵到了我的室友。继续保持，尖叫。

_It's a little fast after the last survey to ask something else, but I'm a goddamn crazy person, so I'll just blaze on ahead. These are optional, so.  
在上一次调查之后这么快又问问题有点快，但我是个该死的疯子，所以我会继续前进。这些是可选的，所以。_

_Survey question: If you were stranded on an island with any fictional character, who would you want to be stranded with? My answer, for the record, is Ellen Ripley, because we all know that she'd be the only possible way I'd get to safety.  
调查问题：如果你和一个虚构角色一起被困在荒岛上，你希望是谁？我的答案，记录在案，是艾伦·里普利，因为我们大家都知道，她是我唯一可能获救的希望。_

_Thanks again for being so cool, guys. You're superstars, all of you. Until next time.  
再次感谢你们的酷劲，伙计们。你们都是超级明星，每一位。下次见。_

"Hey! What's the big mystery?" Shinji laughs through the door to our bathroom. "What are you doing in there?"  
"嘿！有什么大秘密啊？" 真嗣隔着浴室的门笑着问我。"你在里面干什么呢？"

"J-just… gimme a second!"  
"就… 给我一点时间！"

I'm not ready. Seeing them on my head again almost feels like an alcoholic's violation of sobriety. I clip them into place and feel the slight tingling I always used to back in the day; not a heightening of senses, per se, but a slight static discharge that settles almost as quickly as you perceive it. I tried to throw them away so many times, but I could never truly bring myself to.  
我还没准备好。再次看到它们在我头上，几乎感觉像是酗酒者违背了戒酒的誓言。我将它们固定好，感受到那种熟悉的轻微刺痛，虽然不是感官的提升，确切地说，只是一种微弱的静电放电，几乎在你察觉到它的瞬间就消失了。我曾多次试图扔掉它们，但我始终无法真正让自己这么做。

Sighing, I muss my hair up in an attempt to make myself feel sexy, but I'm actually nervous. Ugh. Five months of dating and I'm actually _nervous_ about him seeing me this way.  
叹了口气，我胡乱抓了抓头发，试图让自己看起来性感些，但实际上我很紧张。唉。五个月的恋爱，我居然真的因为他这样看我而感到紧张。

It's pathetic. I wouldn't have been nervous back when I wore these things regularly.  
这真是可悲。以前我经常穿这些东西的时候，可不会这么紧张。

Maybe the difference is now he can actually reject me, whereas before I would have laughed any serious advance off and remained untouched and victorious, above such petty human emotions. Power shifts in weird ways like that. I feel a chill and self-consciously cross my arms over my chest.  
或许区别在于，现在他真的有可能拒绝我，而以前我只会对任何认真的追求一笑置之，保持不受触碰且胜利的姿态，超然于这些琐碎的人类情感之上。权力以奇怪的方式转移。我感到一阵寒意，下意识地交叉双臂抱在胸前。

_He doesn't love you_, the angry red ghosts at the top of my head whisper, _no one could ever really love you. He's in love with a fantasy - a girl he used to touch himself to_.  
他并不爱你，我头顶上那些愤怒的红色幽灵低语着，没有人会真正爱你。他爱的是一个幻想——一个他曾用来自我慰藉的女孩。

You're lying. It wouldn't have lasted this long if he didn't love the real me.  
你在撒谎。如果他不爱真实的我，这段关系不会持续这么久。

_We **are** the real you. We are the sad little girl who never amounted to anything. We are the sum of all of your failures.  
我们才是真实的你。我们是那个从未有所成就的悲伤小女孩。我们是所有失败的集合体。_

I frown, and look away from the reflection in the bathroom mirror.  
我皱起眉头，从浴室镜中的倒影移开视线。

I'm… scared. I'm actually really fucking scared right now, but I have to do this. I have to know.  
我……害怕。我现在真的非常他妈的害怕，但我必须这么做。我必须知道。

"Asuka? Are you… coming to bed?" His voice is softer this time, with some of the humor gone.  
"明日香？你……要来睡觉吗？" 这次他的声音柔和了许多，幽默感也消失了些。

I bite my lower lip, steel myself, and walk to the door.  
我咬了咬下唇，鼓起勇气，走向门口。

Opening it, I reveal myself wearing nothing but my Unit-02 sync clips. After a beat, I see Shinji's eyes go wide in shock.  
打开门，我身上只戴着 Unit-02 的同步夹，过了一会儿，我看到真嗣的眼睛因震惊而睁大。

There is silence, and then he lets out a breath I didn't even realize he was holding.  
一片寂静，然后他呼出一口气，我甚至没意识到他一直在屏息。

"…well?" I ask. “……嗯？”我问道。

"You look…" Shinji pauses, his eyes scanning up and down my body before coming to rest at the top of my head. He closes his mouth and shakes his head gently. "You look beautiful, Asuka. You always do."  
“你看起来……”真嗣顿了顿，目光上下打量着我的身体，最后停留在我的头顶。他闭上嘴，轻轻摇了摇头。“你看起来很美，明日香。你一直都很美。”

I feel the blush creep up my face. It's not that I haven't heard Shinji say so before, but he always sounds so damn sincere when he says it. There's not mistaking it for anything but honesty. My fear is still there, however. I want to close the door and hide forever, but I need this. I need to know.  
我感到脸颊泛起红晕。虽然不是第一次听真嗣这么说，但他每次说这话时都显得那么真诚。毫无疑问，这是他的真心话。然而，我的恐惧依然存在。我想要关上门，永远躲藏起来，但我需要这个。我需要知道。

"…and what about _them_?" I motion upwards with my chin.  
"…那他们呢？" 我下巴朝上示意。

"The clips?" He blinks. "What _about_ them?"  
"那些夹子？" 他眨了眨眼。"关于它们，你有什么想说的？"

"Do you like them? Hate them? Any long-suppressed thoughts firing back up?" I swallow anxiously. "Come on, give me something, you dummy."  
"你喜欢它们吗？讨厌它们？有没有什么长期压抑的想法重新冒出来？" 我焦虑地咽了咽口水。"快点，给我点反应，你这个傻瓜。"

Shinji smiles and shrugs. "Honestly, I don't really care. _They_ don't matter, Asuka – you do." He chuckles. "I mean, you can start wearing them again if you like, but it doesn't matter to me either way. I didn't even notice you were wearing them at fir-"  
真嗣微笑着耸了耸肩。“老实说，我并不太在意。他们无关紧要，明日香——你才是重要的。”他轻笑道，“我是说，如果你愿意的话，可以重新开始穿它们，但对我来说怎样都无所谓。我甚至一开始都没注意到你穿了它们——”

I nearly leap across room, and I seal off his stupid, perfect mouth with a kiss.  
我差点跳过整个房间，用一个吻封住了他那愚蠢而完美的嘴。

His hands find my body, and I'm lost to the world but indescribably found.  
他的手触碰到我的身体，我仿佛迷失了世界，却又不可思议地找到了归宿。

I never wear those damned things again.  
我再也不会穿那些该死的东西了。

The sixteen hour plane ride is interminable and I hate the shit out of it. I'm dying for a cigarette when we pick up our bags in Munich. Shinji only flinches a little when he sees me light up. Even after three years of smoking, I know he hates it.  
那十六小时的飞机旅程漫长得让人无法忍受，我对此深恶痛绝。在慕尼黑取行李时，我迫切地想抽根烟。真嗣看到我点烟时只是微微皱了皱眉，尽管他已经忍受了我三年的烟瘾，我知道他还是讨厌这个。

I've cut way back, to my credit. I used to need one almost every half-hour, and now I can go several days without one. Lately, it's pretty much only if I'm super stressed or super drunk. Thanks to the in-flight drinks, I'm a little bit of both, but I know the craving is mostly from having just spent the entire day in a fucking tin box. First class be damned – I hate being in things I can't run away from, and there's no emergency exit when you're four miles over China.  
我得承认，我已经大大减少了抽烟的次数。以前我几乎每半小时就得抽一根，现在我可以好几天不碰。最近，基本上只有在极度紧张或酩酊大醉时才会抽。多亏了飞机上的饮料，我现在有点这两种状态，但我知道这种渴望主要是因为刚刚在那个该死的铁盒子里度过了一整天。头等舱又如何——我讨厌被困在无法逃离的地方，而当你在四万英尺高空飞越中国时，根本没有紧急出口。

Also, it reminds me a little too eerily of the other monstrous machine I used to sit in for hours at a time. Formerly proud memories, now only painful.  
此外，它让我不由自主地想起了另一台曾经让我长时间坐在里面的可怕机器。那些曾经引以为傲的记忆，如今只剩下痛苦。

So, on my way out of the airport I saw the pack of Gauloises, which I haven't tasted in half a lifetime, and here I am observing Shinji as he tastes the air of my homeland. He jumps slightly as a hurrying couple bumps into him.  
于是，在离开机场的路上，我看到了那包高卢香烟，我已经半个世纪没有尝过了，而现在我站在这里，看着真嗣感受着我祖国的空气。一对匆忙的夫妇撞到了他，他微微一跳。

"Es tut mit… uh…" he mumbles shyly, looking down as if the correct German may somehow be written on the ground. I can't help but crack a smile.  
“这让我…呃…”他害羞地咕哝着，低头看着地面，仿佛正确的德语会以某种方式写在上面。我忍不住露出了微笑。

He sighs. In Japanese: "I'm never gonna get this language."  
他叹了口气。用日语说：“我永远也学不会这门语言。”

"Aww come on," I say, taking his hand. "If anything bad happens, you have a translator. And you're sleeping with her, so she probably won't lead you astray." I give him my most reassuring grin and squeeze his hand a little.  
“哎呀，别这样，”我说着，握住他的手。“如果有什么不好的事发生，你还有个翻译。而且你还和她睡在一起，所以她大概不会让你走错路。”我给了他一个最令人安心的微笑，轻轻捏了捏他的手。

"And besides," I continue, "you've been studying German for what, three months? I'm surprised you can form a sentence at all, to be honest. You're doing pretty damn well, give yourself a little credit." I bump his shoulder with my own and he brightens up a little.  
“而且，”我继续说，“你学德语才三个月吧？说实话，我惊讶你居然能组成一个句子。你已经做得相当不错了，给自己一点信心。”我用肩膀轻轻撞了撞他的肩膀，他脸上露出了些许笑容。

"You're right. It's going okay, I guess…"  
"你说得对。我想，进展还算顺利……"

"Genau." "没错。"

"Everyone keeps trying to speak English to me, though."  
"但大家都一直试图用英语跟我交流。"

"Yeah, it's pretty much what they default to if they're not sure where you're from. Welcome to Europe." I shrug, showing exactly what I think of that practice. Shinji sulks again.  
“是啊，如果他们不确定你来自哪里，通常就会这么做。欢迎来到欧洲。”我耸耸肩，表达了对这种做法的看法。真嗣又郁闷了。

"Why do they do that?"  
“他们为什么要那样做？”

I blow smoke and shrug. "They were a superpower once. Old habits and lingua franca are hard to break."  
我吐出烟圈，耸了耸肩。“他们曾经是超级大国。旧习惯和通用语言很难改掉。”

Shinji nods, but still looks a little glum, as if not learning an entire system of communication in an impossible amount of time was somehow a personal failing. He takes everything far too much to heart, as I've told him before.  
真嗣点点头，但看起来还是有些沮丧，仿佛在不可能的时间内没有学会一整套交流系统是一种个人失败。他总是把事情看得太重，就像我之前告诉他的那样。

"You worry too much," I would say, laughing it off but meaning it.  
“你太担心了，”我会笑着说，虽然是在开玩笑，但也是认真的。

Presently, he still sulks.  
目前，他仍在生闷气。

"…I don't think I'm ever going to get English, to be honest."  
"…说实话，我觉得我永远也学不会英语。"

"Yeah, well fuck it. Stupid nonsense language, anyway." I stub out the cigarette with the heel of my sneaker, and we begin to walk towards the taxis, Shinji doing the majority of the bag carrying. I brought more stuff than him, but it always seems to work out this way. Funny, that.  
"是啊，管它呢。反正都是些愚蠢的胡言乱语。"" 我用运动鞋的后跟碾灭了烟头，我们开始向出租车走去，信二承担了大部分行李的搬运。我带的东西比他多，但事情总是这样发展。真有意思。"

"We're uh…" Shinji trails off as I try to hail something. "Your dad doesn't speak Japanese, does he?"  
"我们呃…"" 信二在我试图叫车时停了下来。""你爸爸不会说日语，对吧？"

"He speaks better Japanese than my mom spoke German, I'll say that." I let out a laugh. "He's okay. He gets by. I don't know the last time he practiced it, though. Might be a little rusty."  
"他说日语比我妈妈说德语还溜，这点我得承认。" 我笑出声来。"他人不错，能应付得来。不过我真不知道他上次练习日语是什么时候了，可能有点生疏了。"

A taxi pulls to a stop in front of us, and I start taking the bags from Shinji and loading them into the back.  
一辆出租车在我们面前停下，我开始从真嗣那里接过行李，把它们装进后备箱。

"Has he ever met one of your uh…" Shinji coughs, "You know. Your important friends?"  
"他有没有见过你的，呃……" 真嗣咳嗽一声，"你知道的，你的重要朋友？"

I close the trunk and lock him into a gaze. As if.  
我关上后备箱，与他目光相锁。仿佛。

_As if there was any boyfriend worth mentioning before you.  
仿佛在你之前有过值得一提的男朋友似的。_

Instead of answering, I place my hand on the side of his face, and kiss him deeply, opening my mouth and giving his tongue a few reassuring strokes with my own. When we separate, I see surprise in his eyes, and I gently pat his cheek.  
我没有回答，而是将手放在他的脸颊旁，深深地吻了他，张开嘴，用我的舌头轻轻安抚他的。当我们分开时，我看到他眼中的惊讶，便温柔地拍了拍他的脸颊。

"There's a first time for everything, Baka-Shinji."  
"凡事总有第一次，笨蛋真嗣。"

Taxi goes to train. Train goes to Heidelberg.  
出租车去火车站。火车去海德堡。

---

On the train, Shinji is asleep and I'm lost in thought, staring out the window at the impressionistic blur of the countryside. It's almost Christmas and for the first time since I was thirteen, I'm spending Christmas in Germany.  
在火车上，真嗣睡着了，我陷入沉思，凝视着窗外印象派画作般的乡间模糊景象。快到圣诞节了，这是我自十三岁以来第一次在德国过圣诞。

I've told Shinji all about the Weinachtsmart in Heidelberg, and how I used to walk there as a child. I used to love Christmas dearly – that was when my whole family came together and everything was warm at home. Even after all the heartache and hell, I still miss that warmth dearly.  
我已经向真嗣讲述了海德堡的圣诞市场，以及我童年时如何步行去那里的情景。我曾深爱着圣诞节——那时全家人团聚一堂，家中处处温暖。即便经历了那么多心痛和苦难，我依然深深怀念那份温暖。

I wonder if it stills smells the way I remember? Probably not. I haven't been back for most of my lifetime now. He's only _vaguely_ aware of Shinji, my one-time copilot and now seven-month boyfriend. He's been my first everything, save love, but I don't even know if Kaji really counts for that now.  
不知那里的气味是否还如我记忆中那般？大概不会了。我已经大半辈子没回去过了。他只是隐约知道真嗣，我曾经的副驾驶，如今交往了七个月的男友。他是我除了爱情之外的一切初体验，但就连对加持的感情，我现在也不确定是否真的算得上爱。

I felt like it was love at the time – I certainly wanted him very badly, but I was fourteen, and I'm not even totally sure you're able to rationalize things like love then. Everything is overwhelming when you're that young, be it affection or desire.  
当时我觉得那就是爱——我确实非常渴望他，但我那时才十四岁，甚至不确定在那个年纪能否理性地理解爱情。当你那么年轻时，无论是情感还是欲望，一切都显得无比强烈。

Shinji was certainly my first time sleeping with a man, which, you know, went…  
真嗣无疑是我第一次与男人共眠的经历，你知道，进展……

Well, it probably went about as well as it could have. There was pain, there was blood, and then there was bliss. Bliss and the completion of a promise that had been neglected for far too long.  
嗯，大概已经算是尽可能顺利了吧。有痛楚，有血迹，随后便是极乐。极乐与一个被忽视太久的承诺的圆满。

After the first time, it was like a honeymoon – I'm not sure there was free time that first week that we _weren't_ having sex, or doing anything that came to our minds as far as sex acts go. There was lust, surely, but there was also tenderness; the joy of discovering sex with someone safe. There is the strength of being friends and talking about things from earlier in the day when we're both naked as the day we came. There was the time we converted to one bed, and how strangely okay I was when our friends find out. I thought I would be embarrassed, but I had strength knowing it was him. And finally the beginning of the pull, towards thinking that this wasn't just physical intimacy, or some fling, but... love.  
第一次之后，宛如蜜月一般——我不确定那第一周里我们有过片刻闲暇不是在亲热，或是在尝试任何能想到的性爱花样。当然有欲望，但也伴随着温柔；与一个安全的人探索性爱的喜悦。有作为朋友的力量，当我们赤裸相对时，谈论着当天早些时候的事情。有我们共枕一床的时刻，以及当朋友们发现时我那出奇的坦然。我原以为自己会感到尴尬，但知道是他，我便有了力量。最终，是那种牵引，让我开始思考这不仅仅是肉体上的亲密，或是一段短暂的恋情，而是……爱。

I can't pinpoint the moment exactly, but my strongest memory of the fall is being in his arms, drifting to sleep and thinking:  
我无法确切指出那一刻，但我对那个秋天的最深刻记忆是躺在他怀里，渐渐入睡，心中想着：

'_This is so much better than I thought it would be.'_  
“这比我想象的要好得多。”

The train barrels onwards, towards my father and into my past, into a hometown I have all but forgotten.  
火车轰隆隆地向前行驶，朝着我父亲的方向，驶入我的过去，进入一个我几乎遗忘的故乡。

_AN: Well that took me long enough. I have no excuses. As intimated in the previous Authors Note, I am in fact pretty awful.  
作者注：好吧，这花了我不少时间。我无话可说。正如前一章作者注中所暗示的，我确实挺糟糕的。_

_All the answers for the desert island question were equally beautiful and valid, with special shoutouts to Panther2G who plainly cheated by picking Q, and DigitalMangekyo for being so delightfully honest. We don't judge here DM, though in all honesty the better choice would have of course been Kurumu, because if all else fails you'll have ample time to- *gunshot*  
关于荒岛问题的所有答案都同样美丽且有效，特别要提到 Panther2G，他显然作弊选了 Q，还有 DigitalMangekyo，他如此坦率令人愉悦。我们这里不评判，DM，虽然老实说更好的选择当然是 Kurumu，因为如果其他都失败了，你会有充足的时间去——*枪声*_

_ANYWAY. Since this chapter finds our heroes abroad, my question for you all is have you traveled? If so, where was your favorite place? If not, where would you **like**_ _to go?_  
总之。既然这一章我们的英雄们身处异国，我想问大家，你们旅行过吗？如果有，你最喜欢的地方是哪里？如果没有，你最想去哪里？

_And if you're still reading, truly thank you, and I promise the next chapter will be more substantial. I had a hell of a summer, and am hoping to be productive again now. Your patience is genuinely appreciated.  
如果你还在阅读，真的非常感谢，我保证下一章会更加充实。我度过了一个糟糕的夏天，现在希望能再次高效起来。你的耐心实在令人感激。_

_Yes, even you. Yes. YOU. I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU DON'T LOO-  
是的，甚至包括你。没错。就是你。我就在你身后，别回头——_

The first thing I can't help but notice about Asuka's house – or rather her father's house, I suppose – was that it hit the exact tenor of largeness where everything seems empty and under-decorated. It's the kind of house that was undeniably impressive, yes, but also had a strange aura of vacancy. A house that wasn't a home.  
我首先注意到的是明日香的家——或者更确切地说，是她父亲的房子——它的宽敞程度恰到好处，一切都显得空荡荡且装饰不足。这是一座无疑令人印象深刻，却又散发着一种奇怪的空虚氛围的房子。一座不像家的房子。

"He doesn't spend all his time here," Asuka says, as if reading my thoughts. She hangs her coat on a hanger that seems to be carved from driftwood. "He has a lot of other people decorate it for him."  
“他不常待在这里，”明日香说道，仿佛读懂了我的心思。她将外套挂在一个看似用浮木雕刻的衣架上。“他有很多其他人帮他装饰。”

"Did your mom decorate it, before?"  
"你妈妈之前装修过吗？"

"No," Asuka sniffs condescendingly at some ostentatious floor-to-ceiling mirror, "she just hired people with better taste."  
"没有，" 明日香对着一面华丽到顶的镜子轻蔑地哼了一声，"她只是雇了些更有品味的人。"

I can't help but feel that this house is actually a mansion. You could fit three families in here, with room to spare, but the only person we've seen was the (rather rude) butler who opened the door and beckoned us into the foyer and abandoned us to our own devices while he saw if Asuka's father 'was available'. There was the unenviable feeling of being 'made time for'.  
我不禁觉得这房子其实是一座豪宅。容纳三个家庭都绰绰有余，但我们见到的唯一一个人是那个（相当无礼的）男管家，他开了门，示意我们进入门厅，然后就丢下我们不管，去看看明日香的爸爸'是否有空'。有种被'抽空时间接待'的不自在感。

I clear my throat, trying to think of what to say. She's obviously uncomfortable, but I'm not sure if she needs space or support right now. Asuka hates it when I baby her too much.  
我清了清嗓子，试图想出该说什么。她显然感到不自在，但我拿不准她现在是需要空间还是支持。明日香讨厌我过度呵护她。

Of course, not enough attention can also raise her ire, which keeps things interesting, I suppose. A year in and I finally feel like I'm starting to get her pattern more.  
当然，关注不够也会惹她生气，这倒让事情变得有趣了，我想。一年过去了，我终于开始更了解她的模式了。

I grimace and avert my gaze. This is her show. Let her set the pace.  
我皱了皱眉，移开视线。这是她的主场。让她来掌控节奏吧。

"So…" I venture as the wait drags on. "When was the last time you saw your dad?"  
"那么…" 我试探性地问道，随着等待的时间延长。"你上次见你爸爸是什么时候？"

"When I departed for NERV with Kaji," she mumbles, and I try to hide my surprise. That was… I mean, that was almost a decade ago.  
"我和加持去 NERV 的时候，" 她含糊地说，我试图掩饰自己的惊讶。那已经是…我是说，那几乎是十年前的事了。"

"Have you guys… talked since then?"  
"你们后来…有联系过吗？"

"Yeah, now and then on the phone," Asuka sighs, "he's a busy man."  
"是啊，偶尔会打电话来，" 明日香叹息道，"他是个大忙人。"

"What's he do?" "他是做什么的？"

"Business." "做生意的。"

Oh. Gotcha. 哦，明白了。

I can see her face reflected in that stupid mirror. She can't stop staring at it. I think she's trying to practice the face she'll put on when her father finally deigns to show up. I practiced faces, too, back in Tokyo-3, before Misato arrived. At the time I had naively thought my father would come to gather me himself. From the train station.  
我能看到她在那面愚蠢的镜子中映出的脸。她无法停止凝视它。我想她是在练习当她父亲终于屈尊出现时该摆出的表情。在东京-3 时，我也练习过表情，在美里到来之前。那时我还天真地以为父亲会亲自来接我。从火车站。

Hours in bathrooms, staring at mirrors, trying desperately to make something appear in them that I didn't hate. All those faces were quickly forgotten the moment I saw Unit-01 for the first time.  
在洗手间里度过的那些时光，凝视镜中的自己，拼命试图在其中找到一个我不讨厌的形象。所有那些面孔在我第一次见到初号机的那一刻便迅速被遗忘了。

Getting to know Asuka better has made me realize just how similar we actually are. _"We're the same,"_ she told me once, _"we just went in different directions."_  
更加深入地了解明日香让我意识到我们实际上有多么相似。她曾对我说过，“我们是一样的，只是走上了不同的道路。”

As I watch her try to conjure up the excited daughter, I realize she doesn't know how right she is.  
当我看着她试图唤起那个兴奋的女儿时，我意识到她说得多么正确。

Twenty more minutes pass before Asuka puts her bag down with a hunch of resignation.  
又过了二十分钟，明日香才带着无奈的驼背放下她的包。

"Let's go to town," she announces.  
"我们去镇上吧，"她宣布道。

"Y-you don't want to wait?" I ask, not entirely sure how to proceed.  
"你不想等一等吗？"我问，不太确定接下来该怎么做。

She grabs her coat from the driftwood. "He'll be here when we get back. I want to get drunk."  
她从浮木上抓起外套。"我们回来时他会在的。我想喝个痛快。

---

Which sounds like a terrible idea, but in lieu of the mirrors and the faces I think I know what she means.  
听起来像是个糟糕的主意，但比起那些镜子和我认为我认识的面孔，我想我知道她的意思。

Maybe this will be a good thing? A little time to blow off steam, just us?  
也许这会是件好事？一点时间来发泄情绪，就我们俩？

"I mean _reeeaally!_" Asuka slurs, taking a large swig from her beer. "Where does he get off?! I travel halfway urrrround the world, and he lets me wait with the butler?! **The butler.**"  
“我是说真——的！”明日香含糊地说，从啤酒瓶里猛灌一口。“他凭什么这样？！我跨越半个地球过来，他却让我和管家一起等着？！那个管家。”

I can't really argue with her, but that's because I'm also pretty damn tipsy. I'm only halfway through my pint and I'm feeling it. Admittedly, I've never been much of a drinker. Asuka's on her third pint.  
我没法和她争辩，但这主要是因为我也醉得厉害。我才喝了一半的啤酒就已经有感觉了。说实话，我从来就不是个能喝酒的人。而明日香已经喝到第三杯了。

"I- I mean," I begin, words slipping through my fingers as I search for them. "I mean, he is your _father_, Asuka."  
"我——我是说，"我开始结巴，寻找合适的词句。"我是说，他毕竟是你父亲，明日香。"

"_Oh, come on_!" she yells, causing some of the bar to turn around and see what the hell these two foreigners are screaming about. "He's awful, Shinji! He made me wait in the foyer of his house like a _pet!_ What do I need him for?! He obviously doesn't care that I'm here! Why should I care if he worries where I am?!"  
"哦，拜托！"她大喊道，引得酒吧里的一些人转过头来看这两个外国人在吵什么。"他糟透了，真嗣！他让我在他家前厅像宠物一样等着！我需要他干什么？！他显然不在乎我在这里！我为什么要关心他是否担心我在哪儿？！"

I feel a pain of sympathy that's all too real. Gendo's face comes unbidden to my mind's eye.  
我感受到一种过于真实的同情之痛。碇源堂的面孔不由自主地浮现在我的脑海中。

I raise my beer and take another sip.  
我举起啤酒，又抿了一口。

"I hated my father," I mumble. It's something I've never come to terms with saying out loud.  
“我恨我的父亲，”我喃喃自语。这是我从未坦然说出口的事情。

"Yeah? Good! Because Gendo Ikari was a massive fucking asshole," Asuka looks away, swilling her drink. "He deserved what happened to him."  
“是吗？好！因为碇源堂就是个超级大混蛋，”明日香转过头去，晃了晃手中的饮料，“他活该落得那样的下场。”

I look at her for a second, my thoughts careening from her statement.  
我盯着她看了一会儿，思绪因她的话而翻腾。

There's the initial indignity – the hurt pride of the family name still stinging. After a moment though, I realize she's... she's _right._ I hated that man so deeply, and I'm sick to death of defending him.  
起初是感到屈辱——家族名誉受损的刺痛感依然存在。但过了一会儿，我意识到她……她说得对。我曾如此深切地憎恨那个人，现在我厌倦了为他辩护。

I feel a smile creep across my face and raise my pint.  
我感到笑容慢慢爬上脸颊，举起了我的啤酒杯。

"Fuck fathers," I say deceisively.  
"去他妈的爸爸们，"我决然地说道。

"Yeah!" roars Asuka, a giant grin across her reddened face. "I'll toast to that! Fuck fathers! Fuck 'em both!"  
"没错！"明日香大声喊道，她那涨红的脸上露出巨大的笑容。"我为这个干杯！去他妈的爸爸们！两个都去他妈的！"

"Kampai." "干杯。"

"Hell yeah, 'kampai!'" "太棒了，干杯！"

She tosses her pint against mine, spilling quite a bit of the liquid over the counter.  
她将她的啤酒杯撞向我的，不少酒液溅到了吧台上。

Tossing the pints back, I get lost in the toffee taste of the beer, and feel triumphant. When I put my glass down, my girlfriend is laughing at her empty glass and wiping her mouth.  
一杯接一杯地喝着，我沉醉在啤酒那太妃糖般的味道中，感到无比胜利。当我放下酒杯时，我的女朋友正对着她空空的杯子笑，并擦着嘴。

"I'll go for one more," she says, standing. "Want one?"  
“我再去拿一杯，”她站起来说，“你要吗？”

I shrug. 我耸了耸肩。

"Does it look like my _dad_ is here?" I say sarcastically.  
“看起来我爸在这儿吗？”我讽刺地说。

Asuka puts her hands on my cheeks and kisses my forehead emphatically, before disappearing into the crowd.  
明日香双手捧着我的脸颊，用力地吻了我的额头，然后消失在人群中。

_What the hell is that noise?_ Touji Suzuhara thinks, before he realizes that awful noise is his phone, and it's ringing right next to his head. Turning over in his bed, he answers the call.  
那是什么鬼声音？铃原冬二心想，随即意识到那糟糕的声音是他的手机发出的，而且就在他头旁边响个不停。他在床上翻了个身，接起了电话。

_There better be a damn good reason for this.  
最好有个该死的好理由。_

"…who the hell is calling now?"  
……谁他妈这时候打电话？

"Touji?! It's Touji! We got him!" Touji hears a distinctly unenthusiastic cheer in the background.  
“斗志？！是斗志！我们找到他了！”斗志听到背景里传来一阵明显不怎么热情的欢呼声。

"…Shinji?" "…真嗣？"

"Yeah! Touji it's me! I calling you from Germany! Geeeerrrrmany! Doit-chland!"  
"是的！透治，是我！我从德国给你打电话！德——国！德意志！"

"Deutschland," Touji hears Asuka's voice correct Shinji over the phone, which only prompts more giggles from the former pilot.  
"是 Deutschland，" 透治听到明日香在电话那头纠正真嗣，这反而让前驾驶员笑得更欢了。"

"Asuka, your language is so silly."  
"明日香，你的话真傻。"

Touji blinks in the darkness.  
在黑暗中，冬二眨了眨眼。

"...are you drunk?" "……你喝醉了吗？"

"What? Yes." Shinji's laugh sounds over the line. "Oh wait! Asuka wants to talk to you!"  
"什么？是的。" 真嗣的笑声通过电话传来。"哦，等等！明日香想和你说话！"

"No I don't." "不，我不想。"

"Yes you do! Touji's your friend, too!"  
"不，你想！托基也是你的朋友啊！"

A great shuffling, and the sounds of weak protest before a sigh:  
一阵窸窸窣窣，伴随着微弱的抗议声，随后是一声叹息：

"Hey idiot, what's up?" “嘿，傻瓜，怎么了？”

"…it's four am," Touji answers honestly.  
“……现在是凌晨四点，” 真嗣诚实地回答。

"Oh yeah. Sorry, it's a lot earlier here."  
"哦，是的。抱歉，这里时间早很多。"

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"…stellar." "……真棒。"

A beat of silence, where Touji considers why he's not hanging up.  
一阵沉默，期间洵二在思考为何他没有挂断电话。

"…so Shinji's drunk?" "…这么说，真嗣喝醉了？"

"Yeah, I think so." "嗯，我想是的。"

"Has that… ever happened before?"  
"这种情况…以前发生过吗？"

"Um," Asuka begins, "I'm not entirely sure actually. I've never seen it firsthand, if so."  
"嗯，" 明日香开口道，"其实我不太确定。如果真是那样，我从未亲眼见过。"

Deep in the distance, Touji hears an unrestrained cry of joy. In the voice of Shinji: _"My girlfriend is amazing and we saved this world with silly robots!"_  
在远处，真嗣那毫不掩饰的欢呼声传入东治耳中："我的女朋友太棒了，我们用那些傻乎乎的机器人拯救了这个世界！"

"…huh," Touji mumbles, massaging the area between his eyes.  
"…呃，" 东治嘟囔着，揉了揉眉心。

"_We have sex now!"_ "我们现在就做爱！"

"Wh-what?! Hey idiot, don't just go sayin-"  
"什——什么？！嘿，白痴，别随随便便就说——"

"_It's amazing sex! You guys don't even-"_  
"这性爱太棒了！你们甚至都不——"

The sound of someone screaming and falling. Hushed gasps from a crowd.  
有人尖叫着坠落的声音。人群中传来压抑的喘息。

"Shinji! Shinji wait no, that's not a-"  
“真嗣！真嗣等等，不，那不是——”

Merciful silence. 仁慈的寂静。

Touji calmly turns off his phone and rolls over to go back to his blessed world of never fucking hearing about this shit again.  
冬二平静地关掉手机，翻身回到他那再也不用操心这些破事的幸福世界。

"Here: water," I hear her say in my ear, pushing a water bottle into my hand. "Water is good. Water is your best friend now."  
"这里：水，" 我听到她在耳边说，递给我一瓶水。"水很好。水现在是你的好朋友了。"

"But I thought _you_ were my best friend?" I whine, leaning my head against her shoulder and nuzzling in towards warmth. I feel a chuckle roll through her body.  
"可我以为你才是我最好的朋友呢？" 我抱怨道，把头靠在她肩上，往温暖处蹭了蹭。我感觉到她的身体因轻笑而微微颤动。

"Well, that's very sweet of you, Shinji, but drink the damn water and stop being a drunk nightmare."  
"哎，真是个好孩子，真嗣，不过快喝那该死的水，别再像个醉鬼噩梦了。"

She sips from her own water bottle I feel her shake her head to clear it. We're sitting on a bench somewhere in the lower town, far away from a bed or her father's house. The thought of that grim, hollow mansion sends a shiver down me. Asuka lights up next to me, gently puffing away.  
她从自己的水瓶中抿了一口，我感觉她摇了摇头想清醒些。我们坐在下城区某处的长椅上，远离床铺或她父亲的宅邸。想到那座阴森空洞的庄园，我不禁打了个寒颤。明日香在我旁边点燃了一支烟，轻轻地吸着。

"Water, Shinji. Water, remember?"  
"喝水，真嗣。记得喝水，好吗？"

"I don't _wanna_ drink water," I hear myself say. She sighs, with exasperation.  
"我不想喝水，" 我听到自己说。她叹了口气，显得有些不耐烦。

"Man, is this what I'm like when I'm drunk?"  
"天哪，我喝醉了就这样吗？"

"No," I slur, "Yerrr worse."  
"不，" 我含糊地说，"你更糟糕。"

The bark of laughter startles me, and I feel her hands pushing me into a sitting position. "Come on, dummy," she says unscrewing the top. "Now drink this, or all those things we do that you just told all of Heidelberg about won't ever happen again."  
突如其来的笑声吓了我一跳，我感觉她的手推着我坐起来。“快点，傻瓜，”她说着拧开瓶盖。“现在喝掉这个，不然你刚才在海德堡说的那些我们做的事就再也不会发生了。”

This convinces me. I sit and drink sullenly.  
这话让我信服了。我坐下来，闷闷不乐地喝着。

"What was _in_ that beer?" I ask.  
“那啤酒里有什么？”我问道。

"Oh, it's Vetter's," she says, sipping her water. "Their beer is 13-proof."  
"哦，这是维特家的，"她喝了一口水说，"他们的啤酒是 13 度。"

"Wait, so I just the equivalent of two pints of wine?"  
"等等，那我岂不是喝了相当于两品脱的葡萄酒？"

"Uh... yeah," Asuka looks kind of surprised by this herself, as if this never occurred to her. She cracks a smile. "Yeah, I guess you did. Sorry about that – I was just so angry that I needed to-"  
"呃... 是的，"明日香看起来对此也有些惊讶，仿佛她从未想到这一点。她露出了微笑，"是啊，我想你确实是。抱歉——我当时太生气了，需要..."

"Nnnno, it's okay. I gettit." More water. Water is my best friend now. "Just gimme a heads-up next time, yeah?"  
"不不不，没事。我懂了。" 又喝了一口水。水现在是我最好的朋友。"下次提前告诉我一声，好吗？"

She laughs. 她笑了。

"Yeah, I will. I think you're pretty fucked up."  
"好的，我会告诉你的。我觉得你真是够呛。"

"I'm sorry," I mumble into the top of the water bottle.  
“对不起，”我咕哝着，把脸埋进水瓶口。

"No, it's my fault," she says, looping her arm around my neck. "It's really my fault, Shinji. I should have thought. You don't have to apologize about anything right now."  
“不，是我的错，”她一边说，一边将手臂环过我的脖子。“真的是我的错，真嗣。我应该多考虑的。你现在不需要为任何事道歉。”

She holds me, and all my world is blessed warmth. I breathe in her scent and know I'm home, even though I'm six-thousand miles away from the house I was born in. This is heaven. I could live her forever.  
她拥抱着我，我的世界充满了祝福般的温暖。我呼吸着她的气息，知道我已归家，尽管我身处六千英里之外的出生之地。这里是天堂。我愿在此永生。

I say something into her side.  
我在她身旁轻声说道。

"Huh?" Asuka asks, "What was that?"  
“嗯？”明日香问道，“你说什么？”

I sit up and look into her eyes.  
我坐起身，凝视着她的眼睛。

"I said 'I love you.'"  
"我说了‘我爱你’。"

For one of the first times since I've known her, Asuka Langley Sohryu cannot speak.  
自从我认识她以来，这是为数不多的几次之一，惣流·明日香·兰格雷无法言语。

"Wh-what? What are you talking abou-"  
"什、什么？你在说什么——"

"I mean I love you. I really do. And I know I'm drunk, Asuka, but that doesn't mean it's not the truth."  
"我的意思是，我爱你。真的。我知道我现在醉了，明日香，但这不代表我说的话不是真的。"

I focus all my energy on staring into her eyes. It feels like falling into an ocean, with water I can swim in.  
我集中所有精力凝视着她的眼睛。感觉就像坠入海洋，那里的水让我可以畅游。

Her mouth hangs ajar. I see her face flush red and tears start to come to her eyes. God, she's never looked more beautiful.  
她的嘴微微张开。我看到她的脸颊泛红，泪水开始涌上眼眶。天啊，她从未如此美丽。

"Shinji, I-" "真嗣，我-"

And that's the last thing I remember before I pitch forward onto the cobblestones and throw up.  
而那是我记得的最后一件事，之后我就向前扑倒在鹅卵石上，开始呕吐。

_AN: First and foremost, we have to all say it together: Happy birthday, Asuka! :D  
作者注：首先，我们必须一起说：祝明日香生日快乐！:D_

_Jeez! We're a traveled crew, aren't we? Especially jealous of Turkey and Ireland, which could not be more different but are similar inasmuch as they're places I'm dying to go.  
天哪！我们真是个旅行团队，不是吗？尤其是对土耳其和爱尔兰，这两个地方截然不同却又相似，都是我渴望去的地方。_

_Question for this week, and in honor of Shinji's major relationship upgrade, we have to know: What was the worst way you've ever confessed affection for someone?  
本周的问题，为了庆祝真嗣重大关系升级，我们必须知道：你曾经用过的最糟糕的表白方式是什么？_

_No wrong answers! And of course this is optional. My worst was the time I gave my ex-girlfriend a Valentine's Day gift (The Good The Bad and The Ugly! One of the best movies ever!), only to have her return it to me the next day and say "Hey, you've gotta stop." Which was amazingly embarrassing. #scarredforlife  
没有错误的答案！当然这也是可选的。我最糟糕的一次是给前女友送了情人节礼物（《黄金三镖客》！有史以来最好的电影之一！），结果她第二天就还给了我，还说：“嘿，你得停下来了。”那真是尴尬极了。#终身难忘的伤痕_

_I did keep the movie though. Because it's fantastic.  
我还是保留了那部电影。因为它太精彩了。_

_And because "You know what you are, Blondie?! Just a dirty sonova- AEEEEEAAAAHHH! wah WAH wahhhhhhhhh"  
还有因为“你知道你是什么吗，金发小子？！不过是个肮脏的——啊啊啊啊啊啊！哇 哇 哇哇哇哇哇”_

_untilnexttime 下次再见_

_A memory: 一段记忆：_

"You know what's weird?" “你知道什么很奇怪吗？”

"What's that?" "那是什么？"

"Languages." "语言。"

I look at my boyfriend and puff at a cigarette. "…go on."  
我看着我的男朋友，吸了一口烟。"…继续。"

"Well, just that like, we need words to communicate thoughts, you know?" Shinji continues. He sounds like a total idiot right now, but I know he's trying to prove a point, so I let him continue. "I mean, words are _important_, right? But they're not really tangible things, they're just sounds that we all decide together have a meaning."  
"嗯，就像我们需要用词语来交流思想，你知道吗？" 真嗣继续说道。他现在听起来像个十足的傻瓜，但我知道他在试图证明一个观点，所以我让他继续。"我的意思是，词语很重要，对吧？但它们并不是真正有形的东西，只是我们共同决定赋予意义的声音。"

"…you're losing me, Ikari."  
"……你把我搞糊涂了，碇。"

"I mean," Shinji's brow furrows in that way it does when he really mulls something over. "Well, 'like' and 'love' are synonyms, right? But they're not _really_. Saying 'I like you' to someone, is important, but the connotation is super different if you use the other."  
"我是说，" 真嗣的眉头皱成那样，当他真的在深思熟虑时就会那样。"嗯，'喜欢'和'爱'是同义词，对吧？但它们并不完全相同。对某人说'我喜欢你'，很重要，但如果你用另一个词，内涵就大不相同了。"

"Yeah, sure. What's your point?"  
"是啊，当然。你想说什么？"

I see Shinji's shoulders shrug through his military-style jacket.  
我看到真嗣穿着军装风格夹克的肩膀耸了耸。

"…I dunno, I was just thinking about it. Someone had to think all those words up at some point, right? They had to sit down and say to themselves: 'Okay, _this_ word means 'nausea' or whatever," he breathes out for a second, thinking more.  
"…我不知道，我只是突然想到。总得有人在某个时候想出这些词吧？他们得坐下来对自己说：‘好吧，这个词的意思是‘恶心’之类的，’"他深吸一口气，继续思考着。

"And it's funny," he continues, "because we have an infinite amount of sounds we can ascribe an infinite amount of words to, and they still don't… always work."  
"而且这很有趣，"他继续说道，"因为我们有无数的声音可以赋予无数的词汇，但它们仍然……并不总是奏效。"

I ash the cigarette on the ground next to me, but the ashes disperse before I see them hit the ground.  
我将香烟弹落在身旁的地面上，但烟灰在我看到它们触地之前就已散去。

"What do you mean they don't work?" I ask, scoffing. "Words are all we have. We think with words."  
"你说的不奏效是什么意思？"我嗤之以鼻。"词汇是我们的一切。我们用词汇思考。"

"No, we have feelings, too. They're purer than words," Shinji insists. I can see him puzzling out something under that stupid mop-top of hair and am a little ashamed to admit how deeply it affects me. "Words are… futile, at the end of the day. They can never capture the really complicated things."  
"不，我们也有感情，它们比言语更纯粹。" 真嗣坚持道。我能看到他在那愚蠢的乱发下苦思冥想，有点羞愧地承认这对我影响有多深。"言语在一天结束时……是徒劳的。它们永远无法捕捉到真正复杂的东西。"

"Like what?" I ask. "比如什么？" 我问道。

"Well, like 'love'. What's love mean, anyway?" Shinji continues, spreading his arms wide. "I can love a place, a person, a dog, some food, but they don't mean the same thing when I say it. But we say the same words! We say 'I love that'. Isn't that odd?"  
"嗯，比如'爱'。爱到底意味着什么？" 真嗣继续说，张开双臂。"我可以爱一个地方、一个人、一只狗、一些食物，但当我这么说时，它们的意思并不相同。但我们用同样的词！我们说'我喜欢那个'。这不是很奇怪吗？"

Shinji looks at me with an imploring look, daring me to challenge his logic. And for once, I cannot.  
真嗣用一种恳求的眼神看着我，仿佛在挑战我质疑他的逻辑。而这一次，我无言以对。

I toss my cigarette somewhere off to my left and turn to him.  
我把烟头扔向左边某个地方，然后转向他。

"Well, I know one thing," I say to him, "They might be futile, but words are all we have, so when you say something to me, you'd better goddamn mean it."  
“好吧，我知道一件事，”我对他说，“也许言语无济于事，但言语是我们仅有的，所以当你对我说什么时，你最好他妈的真心实意。”

---

Shinji is slowly recovering from his hangover, and I hate that I find it cute. I shouldn't. I should tell myself that this is his body battling the same poison that's haunted my life since I was 16.  
真嗣正在慢慢从宿醉中恢复，而我讨厌自己觉得这很可爱。我不该这么想。我应该告诉自己，这是他的身体在与同样困扰我自 16 岁起生活的毒素作斗争。

But if I'm being honest? It's goddamn adorable. He's mistaken the pillow I was using for me, and every once in a while I see him burrow his face deeper into it, trying to block out the morning and what I'm sure is a blinding pain in his head.  
但如果我诚实地说？这他妈的太可爱了。他误把我用的枕头当成了我，偶尔我会看到他把脸更深地埋进去，试图挡住早晨和那肯定让他头痛欲裂的疼痛。

Shinji's breathing evens out, and I can tell he's asleep again. Good. It'll hurt less the longer he sleeps.  
真嗣的呼吸变得均匀，我知道他又睡着了。很好。他睡得越久，醒来时疼痛就会越轻。

I head into the bathroom, making sure to close the door softly behind me. Then I lock the door and start allowing myself to freak the fuck out.  
我走进浴室，确保轻轻关上门。然后我锁上门，开始让自己彻底崩溃。

_What did he mean?! I mean, I KNOW what he meant but did he REALLY mean it?!  
他是什么意思？！我是说，我知道他的意思，但他真的那么想吗？！_

If he didn't then he's a piece of garbage. You don't just toss around words like that to a girl, especially not one that you live with. If he did mean it, does he… what does he want me to do about it? 'I love you', so there. Gauntlet thrown and response expected.  
如果他不是认真的，那他就是个垃圾。你不能随便对一个女孩说那种话，尤其是和你同住的女孩。如果他是认真的，那他……他想让我怎么做？‘我爱你’，就这样。挑战已经发出，回应是必须的。

That is, of course, contingent on if he remembers admitting he loves me, and there's a distinct possibility he does not. If he doesn't, that's fine and we never have to think about this ever again.  
当然，这取决于他是否记得承认他爱我，而他很可能并不记得。如果他不记得，那也没关系，我们永远不必再想起这件事。

_What if he does remember, but was just really, really drunk and didn't mean it in the way you think he did?  
如果他确实记得，但当时只是真的、真的喝醉了，并不是你以为的那种意思呢？_

I pause at this.  
我对此停顿了一下。

I mean… I mean I know Shinji likes me. I know he likes me a lot. Not a lot of people would have been able to deal with me for the years he has, and he hasn't run away yet.  
我是说… 我知道真嗣喜欢我。我知道他非常喜欢我。没多少人能忍受我这么多年，而他至今还没逃走。

Do I…

…_do I love him?_ …我爱他吗？

I let the thought twirl around in my brain. After a moment, I turn on the shower and let the water wash away my doubts and insecurities and the thought that regardless of whether he meant it or not, he's the first person that's ever said those words to me in my entire life.  
我任由这个念头在脑海中盘旋。片刻后，我打开了淋浴，让水流冲刷掉我的疑虑和不安全感，以及那个念头——无论他是否真心，他都是我一生中第一个对我说出那些话的人。

---

I'm standing in my father's study, and by the time he enters the room, I've figured out the words I need to say.  
我站在父亲的书房里，等到他进屋时，我已经想好了要说的话。

"Asuka," is his only introduction. I turn and I smile at him as best as I can and feel all my imagined conversations slip through my fingers and into the abyss of the forgotten.  
“明日香，”他只说了这么一句作为开场。我转过身，尽可能地向他微笑，感到所有想象中的对话都从指间滑落，消失在遗忘的深渊中。

I straighten my dress and I bow. "Father." He crosses the room, and for a moment I think he's going to hug me. I'm ashamed to say I feel my heart flutter a little at the prospect.  
我整理了一下裙子，然后鞠了一躬。“父亲。”他穿过房间，有那么一刻，我以为他会拥抱我。说来惭愧，想到这个可能性，我的心竟微微颤动。

His hands clap on my shoulders twice, and he nods proudly.  
他的双手在我肩上拍了两下，然后自豪地点了点头。

"You've grown up!" he says, "You… goodness you look so much like your mother now."  
“你长大了！”他说，“你……天哪，你现在看起来真像你母亲。”

I smile again, though I feel like screaming inside. _What was I supposed to say, again? There was something I wanted to talk to him about…_  
我再次微笑，尽管内心想要尖叫。我本该说什么来着？有件事我想和他谈谈……

"Thanks, dad, you look…" “谢谢，爸爸，你看起来……”

_Old._ Very old now. Wasn't he taller?  
“老了许多。现在非常老。他不是更高吗？”

"…you look good too," I finish. He takes a seat at his desk and invites me to sit opposite him, which I do.  
“……你看起来也很不错，”我最后说道。他在桌前坐下，示意我坐在他对面，我便照做了。

A fire crackles in the hearth, and I wonder about the prudence of putting so many books near an open flame.  
壁炉里的火噼啪作响，我不禁怀疑把这么多书放在明火旁边是否明智。

My father spreads his hands, "Well."  
父亲摊开双手，“好吧。”

He looks around his table as if his business papers will somehow be inspiration for a subject, and then he removes a decanter of brandy.  
他环顾着桌上的文件，仿佛那些商业文件能给他带来灵感，随后他取下了一瓶白兰地。

"Would you like a drink?"  
“要来一杯吗？”

I feel like I'm in a job interview.  
我感觉自己像是在参加工作面试。

"No, thank you," I say.  
“不了，谢谢。”我说。

"Oh come now, Asuka. Just for old time's sake." He pours two glasses without waiting for my acquiescence. I take the glass and let it feel heavy in my hands.  
“哦，来吧，明日香。就当是怀念过去。”他不等我同意就倒了两杯酒。我接过杯子，感受着它的沉重。

_Old time's sake?_ I fight back a scoff. _Yeah, because we used to drink together_ _**all the time**_ _when I was eleven…_  
怀念过去？我忍住一声嗤笑。是啊，因为我们以前经常一起喝酒，那时我才十一岁……

"Was the flight nice?" he asks.  
"飞行还愉快吗？" 他问道。

"It was… it was fine I guess."  
"还行吧，我想。"

"KLM?" "荷兰皇家航空？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"They're a good airline."  
"他们是一家不错的航空公司。"

"Yeah, I uh… yeah, sure."  
"是啊，我呃…对，当然。"

He nods, taking this non-information in as if I were telling him something important. He clears his throat.  
他点点头，仿佛我在告诉他什么重要的事情一样接受了这个无足轻重的信息。他清了清嗓子。

"I understand your friend is here, too."  
"我知道你的朋友也在这里。"

"Boyfriend," I correct him.  
"是男朋友，" 我纠正他。"

"Oh?" For the first time in the conversation he looks vaguely interested, but it's not a look of paternal concern, simply an acknowledgement that yes, there are indeed things he doesn't know. "How long have you two been seeing each other?"  
"哦？" 这是对话中他第一次显得有些兴趣，但这并非出于父辈的关心，只是简单地承认，确实有些事情他不知道。"你们在一起多久了？"

"Almost two years now." “差不多两年了。”

"And you just turned twenty-three?"  
“而你刚满二十三岁？”

My brow furrows. I feel my fake smile slipping, but I manage a curt nod.  
我皱起眉头。感到我那假笑正在消失，但我还是勉强点了点头。

_I'm your daughter...  我是你的女儿..._

"Twenty-three… good age. Are you two thinking about marriage?"  
"二十三岁…好年纪。你们俩考虑结婚了吗？"

"Uh… no, I mean we haven't… no."  
"呃…没有，我是说我们还没…没有。"

"Ah. It's not serious then?"  
“啊，那不是很严重吧？”

"No I mean… yes it _is_ serious, it's just that," I brush my hair back behind my ear, "you know, I don't want to ruin things by moving too fast. That'll happen if it happens."  
“不，我是说……是的，这很严重，只是，”我把头发撩到耳后，“你知道的，我不想因为进展太快而破坏了现状。顺其自然吧。”

"Mm. It's tough to know when you're ready for it."  
“嗯。很难知道什么时候你准备好了。”

The one of his voice doesn't invite discussion into _that_ subject. A message blips on his computer, and I can feel his eyes drifting towards the desktop. He's trying to surreptitiously read the subject line.  
他对于这个话题的声音并不鼓励讨论。他的电脑上弹出一条消息，我能感觉到他的目光飘向了桌面。他正试图偷偷阅读主题行。

I'm certain I'm not smiling anymore.  
我确信我已经不再微笑了。

_I'm your_ _**daughter.**_ 我是你的女儿。

"So," he says, turning to type a response, "I'd love to meet him. Maybe you, Shinichi and I-"  
"那么，" 他转过身去打字回复，"我很想见见他。或许你、新一和我——"

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

"Right, maybe we could all meet for dinner sometime this week? I could have Hans arrange everything. Oh, did you meet Hans? He's our butl-"  
"对，也许我们这周可以找个时间一起吃晚饭？我可以让汉斯安排一切。哦，你见过汉斯吗？他是我们的管家——"

"Was there a single day in your entire god damn life that you loved me?" I ask.  
"你这辈子有没有哪怕一天是真心爱过我的？" 我问道。"

His fingers pause above the keys. My face feels hot with embarrassment and impotent rage.  
他的手指在键盘上停顿。我的脸因尴尬和无力的愤怒而感到发烫。

_Fuck this. 去他妈的。_

I stand, and I knock the brandy off of the desk. I get a sick sort of satisfaction from hearing it clatter against the wooden floor.  
我站起身，将白兰地从桌上扫落。听着它撞击木地板的声响，我感到了一种病态的满足。

"You're my _father!_ I haven't seen you in ten years, and we're-" I shake my head incredulously. "What are we even talking about here?! This is just polite nice-to-meet-you _bullshit!_ You haven't been listening to single word I've been saying!"  
"你是我的父亲！我十年没见你了，而我们——" 我难以置信地摇摇头。"我们到底在谈什么？！这只是客套的初次见面废话！你根本没听进我说的任何一个字！"

His face is stony, but at least he's looking at me now.  
他的脸冷若冰霜，但至少现在他正看着我。

"You want to know about my life, huh?! Why, so you have some interesting trivia to tell your pals over drinks?! 'My darling daughter this' and 'my beautiful girl that'. You don't mean _any_ of it! You don't care! If you _cared_ it wouldn't have taken us ten fucking years to have this conversation!"  
"你想了解我的生活，是吧？！为什么，这样你就可以在酒桌上给朋友们讲些有趣的轶事了吗？！'我亲爱的女儿这样'和'我美丽的女孩那样'。你根本不是真心的！你不在乎！如果你在乎，我们不会等到十年后才有这场对话！"

"Asuka, that's quite eno-"  
"明日香，这真是相当地……"

"You want some interesting things about my life? Okay, let's start!" I crack my knuckles, and begin to count on my fingers. "I smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and have since I got to college. Yes. I know. I hear it's really '_bad for you'._ I have a severe drinking problem, and I think borderline alcoholism, but I'm working on it, which _sucks_ but that's life, right? This all points to me just having an addictive streak in my personality in general, and what I would consider more than a small inclination towards self-sabotage, but that's not much of a shock considering that you and mom sent me – when I was a _child –_ to go _die in a fucking robot!"_  
"你想了解我生活中的趣事？好啊，让我们开始吧！" 我活动着手指，开始一一列举。"我每天抽一包烟，从上大学开始就这样了。是的，我知道，我听说是真的'对你不好'。我酗酒问题严重，甚至可以说是酒精依赖，但我正在努力克服，虽然很糟糕但这不就是生活吗？这一切都表明我性格中有一股难以抗拒的成瘾倾向，以及我自认为不小的自我毁灭倾向，但考虑到你和妈妈在我小时候就把我送去驾驶那该死的机器人，这也不算什么大惊小怪的事了。"

He opens his mouth but I bowl him over. I can't stop now – I've found my words again, and they taste triumphant in my mouth.  
他张开嘴想说什么，但我抢先一步。我停不下来——我再次找到了我的话语，它们在我口中尝起来是如此胜利。

"I've tried to kill myself before, once very seriously, but the only person – and I really mean this, dad, the _ONLY_ person – who noticed or cared is the man who is now my boyfriend! Maybe I will marry him? I don't fucking know! I'm twenty-three! It's a bit soon to god damn ask, but I _will_ say this: he took my virginity, he has my whole heart in the palm of his hand and he's too good of a person to realize what that could mean! He's the most important thing that's ever happened to me in my entire lifetime, and you don't even have the decency to remember his _GOD DAMN NAME!"_  
“我曾尝试过自杀，有一次非常严重，但唯一注意到并关心我的人——爸，我真心实意地说，是唯一的那个人——就是现在我的男朋友！也许我会嫁给他？我他妈怎么知道！我才二十三岁！现在谈这个有点太早了，但我要说：他夺走了我的童贞，我的整颗心都在他的掌中，而他太善良以至于没意识到这意味着什么！他是我一生中发生过的最重要的事，而你甚至没有礼貌去记住他该死的名宇！”

I take a step back. My chest is heaving like I just ran a marathon. I point to this cruel, stupid old man.  
我后退一步。我的胸膛像刚跑完马拉松一样剧烈起伏。我指向这个残忍、愚蠢的老人。

I make my voice as even and rational as I humanly can:  
我尽可能让自己的声音听起来平静而理智：

"What _is_ his name, dad? If you tell me what his name is right now, I will apologize, and I will play the good daughter, and I'll see you at whatever time Hans decides we eat." I stare into his eyes. "So what is it?"  
"他叫什么名字，爸爸？如果你现在告诉我他的名字，我会道歉，我会扮演好女儿的角色，我会按照汉斯决定的时间来见你。" 我凝视着他的眼睛。"那么，他叫什么？"

There's a part of me that hopes he'll just say 'Shinji' and that for once in our lives we can be a family the way we're supposed to be – the way we never were with my real mama or the woman he married after her.  
我内心的一部分希望他能直接说出'真嗣'这个名字，这样我们就能像本该成为的那样，成为一个真正的家庭——就像我们从未与我的亲生母亲或他后来娶的那个女人那样生活过。

Maybe… 也许……

Maybe 'love' is the family we choose for ourselves? Maybe that's what the word really means: 'I am _choosing_ you.' It means that this person – this _specific_ person - has more value to you than most other people in the entire world. It means you ache in their absence, and that you will do anything to ensure they stay by you, because they make your life _better_. They make _you_ better. They fix you the way everyone deserves to be fixed. Family doesn't always do that for you; the people you love do.  
或许‘爱’就是我们为自己选择的家人？也许这个词真正的含义是：‘我选择了你。’它意味着这个人——这个特定的人——对你来说比世界上大多数其他人都要珍贵。它意味着你在他们不在时感到痛苦，并且你会不惜一切确保他们留在你身边，因为他们让你的生活变得更美好。他们让你变得更好。他们以每个人都值得的方式修复你。家人并不总能为你做到这一点；你爱的人却能。

I feel nothing for this heartless old stranger in front of me.  
我对眼前这位冷酷无情的老陌生人毫无感觉。

And I never will. 我永远不会。

After what seems like an eternity, my father opens his mouth, "Well, I see the tantrums haven't changed very much."  
仿佛过了一个世纪，我父亲终于开口了，“嗯，看来发脾气这事儿一点儿也没变。”

I let my hand drop to my side, and I nod.  
我把手垂到身侧，点了点头。

I'm not even angry anymore. I don't care enough anymore.  
我甚至不再感到愤怒。我已经不在乎了。

I turn for the door without so much as a goodbye.  
我转身向门口走去，连声再见都没说。

I march to my room, and I open the door to see Shinji sitting up in the bed. He's dressing. It's past noon, but he's just getting up now, the worst of the hangover well passed.  
我快步走向自己的房间，打开门，看到真嗣坐在床上。他正在穿衣服。已经过了中午，但他现在才起床，宿醉最难受的时候已经过去了。

"Is everything okay?" He looks concerned as he pulls his shirt on over his head. "I heard you guys shouting, bu-"  
“一切都好吗？”他一边把衬衫套过头，一边关切地问，“我听到你们在大声争吵，但是——”

"Hey Shinji," I say. "嘿，真嗣，" 我说。

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"I love you, too." "我也爱你。"

_AN: Hi, it's me, hidinginplainsight - the neglectful hermit who comes down from the mountain once annually to actually update his stories.  
作者：嗨，是我，hidinginplainsight——那个每年下山一次来更新故事的疏忽隐士。_

_I think I've just come to the conclusion that these chapters literally just arrive when they do, and there's very little I can do to speed that up. Sorry bros, my bad. I will say that I'm marginally better at responding to inbox messages than updating, so if there's a particular story that you want updates on, let your voice be heard there. I truly will take it into consideration and light a fire under that one.  
我想我刚刚得出了一个结论，这些章节实际上就是在它们该出现的时候出现，而我能加速它们到来的能力非常有限。抱歉了兄弟们，是我的错。我得说，我在回复收件箱消息方面比更新要稍微好一点，所以如果你特别想了解某个故事的更新情况，就在那里发出你的声音吧。我确实会认真考虑并点燃那把火。_

_Anyway, I'm reasonably sure the next chapter of this will be the final one, so look forward to that! It'll be the second not-a-oneshot that I ever actually complete.  
无论如何，我相当确定这部的下一章将是最终章，所以敬请期待！这将是我实际完成的第二个非短篇故事。_

_SO. Survey! Panther2G's story was the cutest, so he's awarded the hidinginplainsight points for this week, which means absolutely nothing. Yay!  
那么，调查结果！Panther2G 的故事最可爱，所以他获得了本周的 hidinginplainsight 积分，这其实毫无意义。耶！_

_For this our final survey question:  
针对我们本次调查的最后一个问题：_

_We meet hundreds of thousands of people over the course of our lifetime. Who was the single one that had the most impact on you (positive or negative), and why?  
在我们的一生中，会遇到成千上万的人。其中哪一个人对你的影响最大（无论是正面还是负面），为什么？_

_Auf Wiederhoren.  再会。_

### Chapter 8
"This winter hasn't been so rough  
这个冬天并不算太严酷  
Oh it was cold, but it wasn't cold enough  
哦，天气很冷，但还不够冷  
To freeze the blood beneath our spines  
不足以冻结我们脊梁下的血液  
And at least I survived."  
至少我还活着。

My brain has stopped working. I might still be drunk. I certainly still feel it at the edges of my temples when I move, but no amount of inebriation could have prepared me for this.  
我的大脑已经罢工了。我可能还没醒酒。当我移动时，太阳穴边缘依然能感觉到那种醉意，但无论多么醉，都无法让我为现在的情况做好准备。

"…what?" “……什么？”

Asuka stands in the doorway of a bedroom I have no memory returning to. I think she's angry, but her voice is even and calm, like someone in shock. If she _is_ angry, I have no idea what she's angry about. Then again, that's honestly kind of my default state with Asuka, anyway.  
明日香站在一个我毫无印象回来的卧室门口。我想她在生气，但她的声音平稳而冷静，像是处于震惊中的人。如果她在生气，我不知道她为什么生气。不过话说回来，对明日香来说，这基本上也算是我的常态了。

Her hand grips tighter on the doorway.  
她的手紧紧抓住门框。

"You heard me," she says. "'I love you.' I do."  
"你听到了，"她说。"'我爱你。'我是真心的。"

Uh...

Yeah, I think I'm still drunk. I'm drunk or this is some sort of very odd, very wish-fulfilling dream. I feel my face start to heat up.  
是啊，我想我还是醉着。我醉了，或者这是某种非常奇怪、非常愿望成真的梦。我感觉我的脸开始发热。

"A-Asuka, I-" "A-明日香，我-"

"I want to get out of here. I never want to come back," she continues. "Nothing here matters anymore. This is just the past." She draws a deep breath. "Here's what's gonna happen: I'm going to go onto the balcony, and I'm going to smoke my last cigarette. Then I'm going to come back in here, we'll pack, and we'll get on a train." She wets her lips and continues, paying no attention to the desperate look of confusion on my face. "We'll see Europe, we'll swim in the Atlantic, we'll do whatever the fuck we want and no one will tell us 'no', and do you know why all of this going to happen?"  
"我想离开这里。我再也不想回来了，" 她继续说道。"这里的一切都不再重要了。这只是过去。" 她深吸了一口气。"接下来会发生的是：我要去阳台上，抽完我的最后一支烟。然后我会回来，我们一起收拾行李，然后搭上火车。" 她舔了舔嘴唇，继续说着，完全不理会我脸上那绝望而困惑的表情。"我们会去看欧洲，会在大西洋里游泳，我们会做任何我们想做的事，没有人会对我们说'不'，你知道这一切为什么会发生吗？"

I truly have no idea.  
我真的毫无头绪。

"It will happen because I love you." For the first time since she began talking, she smiles. A moment later a giggle slips out of her mouth. She looks… unburdened. She looks like she was in chains and is at long last finally free.  
"这会发生，因为我爱你。" 这是她开始说话以来第一次露出微笑。片刻后，她忍不住笑出声来。她看起来……如释重负。她仿佛曾被枷锁束缚，如今终于长久地重获自由。

And she is overwhelmingly beautiful.  
而她美得令人窒息。

I finally find my voice, and ask the only question that seems relevant anymore.  
我终于找回了自己的声音，问出了似乎是唯一还相关的问题。

"Asuka, is… is everything okay?"  
"明日香，是…是都还好吗？"

She nods curtly. "I'll see you in ten minutes."  
她简短地点了点头。"十分钟后见。"

With a turn, she walks out of the room.  
转身，她走出了房间。

And everything she had said came true.  
她所说的一切都应验了。

---

No one in the party is speaking, but Asuka especially seems frozen in shock. She might as well have been hewn from stone, stuck forever in a half-turn, surprise permanently etched into her blue and red.  
派对上无人言语，但明日香似乎尤为震惊，仿佛石化一般僵立。她半转着身，仿佛被永远定格，那份惊讶深深烙印在她蓝红相间的装束上。

My hands are shaking, and as far as I can tell they're the only things moving in the room. The ring box between them trembling slightly in the air and getting heavier by the second. How long has it been already? I feel like I could have lived and died and lived again in the time it's taken her to process what is happening.  
我的双手在颤抖，据我所见，它们是房间里唯一在动的。戒指盒在它们之间微微颤动，每秒都显得愈发沉重。已经过去多久了？我感觉在这段时间里，我仿佛已经历了生死轮回。她究竟要多久才能理解正在发生的事？

Is this a good sign? At least now I know that she certainly didn't see this coming, but my girlfriend isn't always a huge fan of surprises. After five years of living as a couple, you'd think that I would have more of a grasp of how her brain works.  
这是个好兆头吗？至少现在我知道她肯定没料到这一出，但我的女朋友并不总是喜欢惊喜。在一起生活了五年，你可能会以为我对她的心思已经了如指掌。

The shock slowly leaves her face, and is replaced with a terrifying blankness. The champagne glass in her hand, which she'd been holding at conversational chest-level, drifts slowly to her hip.  
她脸上的震惊慢慢消退，取而代之的是一种可怕的空白。她手中原本保持在交谈时胸前高度的香槟杯，缓缓地移到了腰际。

She's appraising me, looking at me in the way only she can – the way that seems to ask a million questions yet invites none in return. I know that this is her 'serious consideration' face, and I know she only brings it out when the gears in her head are working in overdrive.  
她在审视我，用只有她能懂的方式打量我——那种眼神似乎在问无数个问题，却又没有邀请任何回答。我知道这是她‘认真考虑’的表情，只有在她脑中思绪飞速运转时才会显露出来。

What... what do I do if she says no? Certainly I've ruined everything then. I really don't know if I could go back to sleeping next to someone who told the world 'you're not good enough'. I mean, I know I'd do it. What other choice would I have?  
如果...如果她拒绝了怎么办？那我肯定是一切都搞砸了。我真的不知道我是否能回到一个对全世界说‘你不够好’的人身边睡觉。我是说，我知道我会这么做。我还能有什么其他选择呢？

I couldn't imagine a future without her; I couldn't imagine an endless expanse of time without her asleep to my left. I... I don't even remember what I _did_ when I was single. How did I fill the days? Who did I talk about everything with? Where was the warmth that let me sleep at night?  
我无法想象没有她的未来；我无法想象没有她在我的左边入睡的无尽时光。我...我甚至不记得单身时我做了什么。我是如何度过那些日子的？我和谁谈论一切？让我夜晚安睡的温暖又在哪里？

Can loneliness kill someone? Can someone actually _die_ of a broken heart? I never want to know, but I've thought about this long enough now to be sure that this is what I want. If she doesn't want it too, then I'll have to...  
孤独能杀人吗？人真的会因心碎而死吗？我永远不想知道，但我已经思考得足够久，足以确定这是我想要的。如果她也不想要，那么我就不得不...

I'll have to accept that somehow.  
我不得不以某种方式接受这一点。

Gauntlet thrown, response expected. My future is in her hands now.  
挑战已发出，回应在即。我的未来现在掌握在她手中。

Asuka's face is still serene; she's still thinking.  
绫波的脸依旧平静；她仍在思考。

After an eternity, she gives me a small, secret smile.  
仿佛过了一个世纪，她才给了我一个隐秘而微小的微笑。

Which is immediately supplanted by her trademark scowl.  
随即就被她标志性的皱眉所取代。

"Okay, but for real though," she turns, addressing the crowd, "where is that Kansai-speaking sonofabitch?"  
“好吧，说真的，”她转身面向人群，“那个说关西方言的混蛋到底在哪儿？”

"_What?!"_ Touji's yell is deafening in the quiet room. He pushes his way forward from behind me, and stands at my shoulder.  
"什么？！" 在安静的房间里，冬二的大喊震耳欲聋。他从我身后挤上前来，站在我肩膀旁。

For my part, I remain on my one knee. Touji points at me.  
至于我，依旧单膝跪地。冬二指着我。

"Do you know how long I had to talk this sad bastard into this?! He's jus' been whinin' and _whining_ for months!" Touji runs a hand through his hair in exasperation. "Ring shopping, Sohryu. He took me _ring shopping_."  
"你知道我花了多长时间才说服这个可怜的家伙吗？！他几个月来一直在抱怨和抱怨！" 冬二烦躁地用手捋过头发。"戒指购物，惣流。他拉我去买戒指了。"

Asuka cocks a hip, and places her fist on it, "Aw, well that's really cute that you guys went on a date, but all I really want to know is if doing it at this party was your idea or his, because honestly?" She points around at the hanging chandeliers, festooned with New Years decorations. "…honestly this is tacky as hell."  
明日香一侧身，一手叉腰，另一手搭在上面，"哎呀，你们去约会真是太可爱了，但我真正想知道的是，在派对上做这事是你的主意还是他的，因为说实话？"她指着挂满新年装饰的吊灯，"……说实话，这真是俗气得要命。"

I am literally dripping with sweat now. The ring is still hanging between us, and is so uncomfortable to hold that it feels like it's literally aflame.  
我现在简直是汗流浃背。戒指还挂在我们之间，拿着它感觉如此不舒服，仿佛真的在燃烧。

Asuka is barely even looking my way. It seems like she's forgotten about me, utterly and completely.  
明日香几乎都没看我一眼。她似乎已经完全、彻底地把我忘了。

"T-_tacky?!"_ Touji explodes to my right. He draws the back of his arm across his mouth. "Okay, you want to know the truth? _Yeah_, the party was my idea, because I thought 'Hey, if my buddy Shinji's gonna be stuck wit' _you_ forever, then we might as well all get drunk before we watch him _ruin his life forever!_"  
"俗气？！" 在我右边，冬二爆发了。他用手臂背擦了擦嘴。"好吧，你想知道真相吗？没错，派对是我的主意，因为我想'嘿，如果我的朋友真嗣要和你永远绑在一起，那我们还不如在他看着自己毁掉一生之前先喝个烂醉！"

"Pfffft." "噗。"

"It's romantic!" "这很浪漫！"

"_PFFFFFFT."_ "噗——"

"Oh wow, that's super mature, Sohryu. What are we doing here?" Touji grabs my arm and hauls me to my feet. "Come on, bud, this shit ain't worth your-"  
"哦哇，真是太成熟了，惣流。我们在这里做什么？" 东治抓住我的手臂，把我拉起来。"快点，兄弟，这些破事不值得你——"

"She didn't answer," I say, finally finding my voice. The party is silent again, Asuka seems to finally remember I'm there. I shake out of Touji's grasp and step towards my girlfriend. I remove the ring and hold it to her. "I… don't care if the answer is no. I hope to god it isn't, but I _need_ you to tell me."  
"她没有回答，" 我终于找回了自己的声音。派对再次陷入沉默，明日香似乎终于记起了我的存在。我挣脱东治的手，走向我的女朋友。我取下戒指，递给她。"我……不在乎答案是否定的。我希望不是，但我需要你告诉我。"

I clear my throat and for the second time that night, I ask: "Asuka, will you marry me?"  
我清了清嗓子，那晚第二次问道：“明日香，你愿意嫁给我吗？”

She blinks. 她眨了眨眼。

"Huh? Oh, I mean, yeah, of course." My heart stops. She tucks her hair behind her ear, her face starting to turn the same color as her hair. "W-wait, that wasn't obvious?"  
“啊？哦，我是说，当然愿意。”我的心跳仿佛停了一拍。她将头发撩到耳后，脸颊开始泛起与发色相同的绯红。“等、等等，这还不够明显吗？”

"Ya had _me_ fooled," Touji grumbles somewhere behind me. He doesn't matter anymore. All that matters is that this is literally the moment all my dreams are coming true.  
"你可真把我骗了，" 阿薰在我身后某处嘟囔着。他现在无关紧要了。重要的是，这简直是我的所有梦想成真的时刻。

Her face is completely red now. "What?!" Turning away, she buries it in her hands. "I gave you the look, though!"  
她的脸现在完全红了。"什么？！"她转过身去，把脸埋在双手中。"我给了你那个眼神啊！"

"The look?" "那个眼神？"

"Yeah! The look!" She turns, her finger pointing at me reproachfully. "It's that look I give! It's the 'yes' look! You know what it means!"  
"耶！就是这个表情！" 她转过身来，手指责备地指向我。"就是我那种表情！那是'同意'的表情！你知道那是什么意思！"

"H-hold on," I stammer, "when was the-?"  
"等-等一下，" 我结巴着说，"什么时候……？"

The redness in Asuka's face hits a critical level. She tosses her hands in the air, pacing madly. "_Augh!_ God! You're such an… you're such an unbelievable… did you _really_ think that-?!"  
明日香的脸红到了极点。她双手一挥，疯狂地踱步。"啊！天哪！你真是……你真是难以置信的……你真的以为……？！"

She comes to a halt in front of me, and shakes her head. Wetness stings at the edge of her eyes. We might be in a room full of people, but this moment exists only between the two of us_._  
她在我的面前停下脚步，摇了摇头。泪水在她的眼角刺痛。我们或许身处满是人群的房间，但这一刻只存在于我们两人之间。

"What are you _stupid?"_ She whispers. She's crying, but she's no long self-conscious enough to hide it. "Of course I want to marry you, you idiot."  
“你是不是傻？”她低声说。她在哭泣，但已经不再在意掩饰。“我当然想嫁给你，你这个笨蛋。”

I pull her into a kiss and the rooms erupts into a cheer.  
我拉她入怀，深深一吻，房间里爆发出欢呼声。

---

"What if she hates me?"  
“万一她讨厌我怎么办？”

I sigh, "She's not gonna hate you…"  
我叹了口气，“她不会讨厌你的……”

There's a shrug against my side.  
我身边传来一阵耸肩的动作。

"You don't know that. She might." Asuka Langley Ikari yawns, and moves her hands down to her swollen stomach. "I hated _my_ mother. I dunno, maybe it's genetic or something?"  
"你不知道的。她可能知道。" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷打了个哈欠，双手移到她隆起的肚子上。"我恨我的母亲。不知道，也许这是遗传什么的？"

"I mean, that was different..."  
"我是说，那不一样……"

Another shrug. 又是一个耸肩。

"Why?" I continue, smirking. "Were you thinking about restarting NERV or something? _Then_ she might hate you, but she wouldn't be the only one, let me tell you."  
"为什么？" 我继续笑着说，"你在考虑重启 NERV 之类的吗？那样的话她可能会恨你，但我要告诉你，她不会是唯一一个。"

She gently pushes a fist into my side, then releases it. She sidles closer in the bed, nuzzling into my chest and snaking her hand down under the covers to find mine.  
她轻轻地用拳头推了推我的侧腰，然后松开。她在床上悄悄靠近，将头埋进我的胸膛，手则伸到被子下寻找我的手。

The room is warm, and I enjoy the feeling of the soft pillow under my head. There's silence for a long time. _Seven months now…_  
房间里很温暖，我喜欢头下柔软枕头的感觉。很长一段时间里，四周一片寂静。已经七个月了……

Asuka didn't know how to take the pregnancy at first. We hadn't been trying for a baby, it had just… happened. It wasn't an insane thought though – we were established now, we had good jobs. It's not like we were in our twenties anymore…  
起初，明日香不知道该如何面对怀孕这件事。我们并没有刻意要孩子，它就这么……发生了。不过这并非不理智的想法——我们现在生活稳定，工作也不错。毕竟，我们已不再年轻，不再是二十多岁的人了……

But still, I had brought up the subject of 'options', simply to give her the peace of mind that if she wasn't ready, I didn't have to be, either.  
尽管如此，我还是提出了‘选择’的话题，只是为了让她安心，如果她还没准备好，我也不必强求。

_"Do you… do you not want it?" she had asked, and she'd looked fragile enough to push over and shatter. "Because I- I mean... I'm **scared**, sure, but it's not like I..." She'd shaken her head in confusion. I could see the fear battling with something else inside of her chest.  
“你……你不想要它吗？”她问道，看起来脆弱得仿佛一推就倒、一碰就碎。“因为我的意思是……我当然害怕，但并不是说我……”她困惑地摇了摇头。我能看到她内心恐惧与另一种情感在激烈斗争。_

_Finally, she'd looked back at me.  
终于，她回头看了我一眼。_

_"I mean… it's **ours**, right? I don't know if I can do that to something that's ours…"  
“我是说……这是我们的，对吧？我不知道我是否能对属于我们的东西这么做……”_

After that the subject hadn't been raised again. We were going to be parents, for better or for worse.  
自那以后，这个话题再也没有被提起。无论好坏，我们将成为父母。

Presently, though, there are no fears our doubts or conversations. There is just my wife, this bed, and the perfection of silence. The room is dark and it's well past midnight, but by her stirring I know she's still awake. Asuka has trouble falling asleep when something's on her mind.  
眼下，没有恐惧、疑虑或对话。只有我的妻子、这张床和完美的寂静。房间里很暗，早已过了午夜，但从她的动静我知道她还没睡。明日香心里有事时总是难以入眠。

"…tell me I'm gonna be a good mom?" It's a statement, like her commands always are, but it sounds like a question. She only does that when she really needs the answer.  
“……告诉我，我会是个好妈妈吗？”这话听起来像命令，一如她平时的口吻，但更像是在提问。她只有在真正需要答案时才会这样。

"You're going to be a great mother."  
“你会是个很棒的母亲。”

"I'm not fat now, right? I don't know, I feel fat..."  
"我现在不胖，对吧？我不知道，我觉得自己胖..."

"You're not fat, Asuka. You're pregnant. That's not the same thing."  
"你不胖，明日香。你是怀孕了。这不一样。"

"Tell me she won't hate me?"  
"告诉我她不会恨我？"

I chuckle, "She won't, I swear."  
我轻笑道：“她不会的，我发誓。”

"How do you know though?" She pushes back and looks at me – two blue fires in the stillness around them. She needs this answer most of all.  
“可你怎么知道呢？”她反问道，目光直视着我——两团蓝色的火焰在周围的静谧中闪烁。她最需要这个答案。

"Well," I venture, treading carefully. "If anything feelings are _really_ genetic, it must be affectionate ones, right? She's half of me, and I certainly love you." I squeeze her hand tighter. "Even when you're being annoying and should really go to sleep. Like right now."  
“嗯，”我小心翼翼地试探，“如果说情感真的有遗传成分，那一定是爱意吧？她有一半来自我，而我当然爱你。”我更紧地握住她的手，“即使你有时很烦人，真的该去睡觉了。比如现在。”

Asuka thinks. 明日香想着。

And then smiles. She plants a kiss on my cheek before lying back down.  
然后她笑了。她在我的脸颊上轻轻一吻，然后又躺了回去。

After a moment, I can't help but ask: "How do you know it's going to be a girl, by the way? Did you ask the doctor?"  
过了一会儿，我忍不住问道：“对了，你怎么知道会是个女孩？你问过医生了吗？”

"Oh," she whispers, sleep now finally taking her. "I don't. But I'm preparing for the worst."  
"哦，"她轻声呢喃，睡意终于将她笼罩。"我不确定。但我正为最坏的情况做准备。"

"I wouldn't mind a girl…"  
"我倒不介意有个女儿……"

"No," my wife says, decisively. "Girls are terrible. We don't want a girl. Trust me."  
"不，"我妻子果断地说。"女孩很糟糕。我们不想要女孩。相信我。"

---

By the time we stop in front of our daughter's school, she's got a grip so tight on Asuka's leg that I'm not sure she's going to let go. Hana always flocks to her mom when she's scared – she may have gotten the hair and the eyes, but she certainly has my timidity.  
当我们停在女儿的学校前时，她紧紧抓着明日香的腿，我都不确定她会不会放手。每当害怕时，hana 总是会依偎在她妈妈身边——她虽然继承了妈妈的头发和眼睛，但胆怯这一点肯定是像我。

"Do I _have_ to go?" she asks, as the school comes into sight. Pre-school was fine, but kindergarten isn't something she thinks she's totally prepared for. I watch her shiver in the fall air.  
"我一定要去吗？" 当学校映入眼帘时，她问道。幼儿园之前还好，但她觉得自己还没完全准备好上小学。我看着她在秋风中颤抖。

"Yes, you do," Asuka gently removes Hana's hands from her leg, and crouches down in front of her. "I tell you all the time that you're stronger than you think, Hana. You're going to be fine," Asuka brushes a hair behind her daughter's ear. "And besides, you're _so_ smart! Come on, I'm sure the other kids are gonna be impressed. How many red-heads are gonna be in the class, you think?"  
"是的，你必须去，" 明日香轻轻地移开 hana 的手，蹲在她面前。"我总是告诉你，你比你想象的要坚强，hana。你会没事的，" 明日香轻拂过女儿耳后的头发。"而且，你那么聪明！来吧，我相信其他孩子一定会对你印象深刻。你觉得班上有多少红头发的孩子呢？

Hana stifles a proud smile and shakes her head. "None."  
花奈强忍住自豪的微笑，摇了摇头。“没有。”

A triumphant kiss to the forehead. "Exactly. Do you _not_ want the other kids to know how cool you are? I would! I'd be proud to be so smart and pretty!"  
一个胜利的吻落在额头上。“正是如此。你不想让其他孩子知道你有多酷吗？我会的！我会为如此聪明和漂亮而自豪！”

Which is truer than our daughter will ever know. Asuka leans in and says something quietly in German that makes Hana laugh. I never really figured the language out, but Hana seems to have an almost preternatural gift for it.  
这比我们的女儿所知道的更为真实。明日香凑近用德语低声说了些什么，逗得花奈笑了起来。我从未真正掌握这门语言，但花奈似乎对它有着近乎超自然的领悟力。

"Fragst du Papa was ihm denken," Asuka suggests, with a sly smirk and a shrug. "Warum nicht?" After a moment of thought, Hana nods, and reaches for my hand.  
"你问爸爸他在想什么，" 明日香建议道，带着狡黠的微笑和耸肩。"为什么不呢？" 经过片刻的思考，Hana 点点头，伸手去握我的手。

I crouch down next to her.  
我蹲在她旁边。

"Were you scared when _you_ went to school, dad?"  
"你上学的时候害怕吗，爸爸？"

"Yeah," I admit in total honestly. "Every first day was a little rough, but you know, soon enough you start to make friends, right?"  
“嗯，”我完全诚实地承认，“每个开学第一天都有点艰难，但你知道的，很快你就会交到朋友，对吧？”

Hana, for her part, still looks a little unsure, but nods anyway. It's decided. She's _going_ to school.  
花菜对此仍显得有些犹豫，但还是点了点头。就这样决定了。她要去上学。

Asuka pats her shoulders, "Now, that all being said: also remember what mommy told you, okay? If any of the other kids gives you shit, you punch them in the face."  
明日香拍拍她的肩膀，“好了，话说完了：也要记住妈妈告诉你的，好吗？如果有哪个孩子欺负你，你就一拳打在他脸上。”

I sigh, shaking my head. "Honey, mommy's just joking again."  
我叹了口气，摇摇头。“亲爱的，妈妈又在开玩笑了。”

"No, I'm not. If any of those kids gives you shit? You punch them. In. The…" Asuka tilts her head forward.  
“不，我不是开玩笑。如果有哪个孩子敢欺负你？你就揍他们。在……”明日香向前倾了倾头。

"…face," comes the reply. Asuka nods, beaming.  
“……脸上，”对方回答道。明日香点头，露出灿烂的笑容。

"That's my girl!" “那是我女儿！”

We both embrace her, and I hear my wife whisper in her ear how much she loves her. Asuka always tries to do it somewhat clandestinely, in some struggling final bit of pride, but it's always obvious to everyone around.  
我们俩都拥抱她，我听到妻子在她耳边低语，表达她有多爱她。明日香总是试图以一种隐秘的方式进行，保留着最后一点挣扎的骄傲，但这总是对周围的人显而易见。

It was the first thing she said to her, in fact.  
事实上，这是她对她说的第一件事。

_Asuka was beside herself. Her hair was plastered to her forehead from sweat, her face a mixture of relief and unfathomable fatigue. All of her fears and doubts and misgivings had disappeared sometime during labor, never to be seen again.  
明日香几乎无法自已。汗水将她的头发紧紧贴在额头上，她的脸上混合着释然与难以言喻的疲惫。所有恐惧、疑虑和不安在分娩过程中消失无踪，再也不会出现。_

_The first time she held Hana, she broke down into tears.  
第一次抱起小 hana 时，她泪流满面。_

_"How do I hold her? Am I holding her right?!" she implored the doctors. "I don't want to hurt her. Please don't let me hurt her, if I start doing something wrong, you **tell** me, okay?!"  
“我该怎么抱她？我抱得对吗？！”她向医生们恳求道，“我不想伤害她。如果我开始做错了什么，请告诉我，好吗？！”_

_They assured her everything was fine, and then it was just us and the child. Our child. 'Hana'.  
他们向她保证一切安好，随后便只剩下我们和孩子。我们的孩子。'Hana'。_

_"She'll always know that she's loved - she's safe," Asuka whispered, promising the world. She re-positioned Hana in her arms, "Shinji, she'll always know I love her. That's all I want..."  
“她会一直知道她是被爱的——她是安全的，”明日香低语，许下承诺。她重新调整了 Hana 在怀中的位置，“真嗣，她会一直知道我爱她。这就是我想要的全部……”_

Children, apparently, can learn from their parent's mistakes.  
显然，孩子们能从父母的错误中学习。

Hana gives us both a kiss on the side of the face, and shoulders her backpack before heading into the courtyard. As if on cue, another six-year-old lets out a yell of excitement and runs over to her. Hana's face lights up and quickly they begin talking.  
花奈在我们俩的脸颊上各亲了一下，然后背起书包朝院子走去。仿佛是约定好的，另一个六岁的小孩兴奋地大叫一声，跑向她。花奈的脸上绽放出笑容，两人很快就开始交谈起来。

"You know, you really shouldn't curse in front of her," I mumble.  
“你知道，真的不应该在她面前说脏话。”我咕哝道。

"Oh come on! The kids last year were great, but what if these are just a bunch of little demon children? I don't want her to get eaten alive in there!" Asuka leans her head against my shoulder. "Besides, she's an Ikari through and through. I don't think she has it in her to punch a kid. Not yet."  
“哎呀，拜托！去年的孩子们都很棒，但万一这些只是些小恶魔呢？我不想她被欺负得体无完肤！”明日香把头靠在我的肩膀上，“再说了，她可是碇家的孩子，我可不觉得她会动手打小孩。至少现在不会。”

"Yet?" "还没？"

"Well, I mean, we've got time." Asuka looks up at me, smiling devilishly, and I can't help but lean down and kiss her. She puts her hand to the side of my face, and we look back at Hana and her friend, disappearing into the sea of children.  
"嗯，我是说，我们还有时间。" 明日香抬头看着我，露出狡黠的笑容，我不由自主地俯身吻了她。她把手放在我的脸颊旁，我们回头望向花和她朋友，消失在孩子们的海洋中。

A lifetime ago, Asuka posited that this moment could never happen because eventually everything ends, but I don't think that's true.  
很久以前，明日香曾断言这一刻永远不会发生，因为最终一切都会结束，但我不认为这是真的。

I think the answer is that a door you don't open is a door that's shut forever.  
我认为答案是，你不去打开的门，就是永远关闭的门。

I think the answer is that nothing ends, and everything continues on. It twists and turns and spirals out until we are all together, for a while, forever.  
我认为答案是，没有什么会结束，一切都在继续。它们扭曲、旋转、向外扩展，直到我们再次相聚，哪怕只是短暂的一刻，也如同永恒。

"Do you think she's going to be okay?"  
“你觉得她会没事吗？”

"Honestly, I wouldn't worry too much about it."  
“老实说，我并不太担心这个。”

THE END 完结
