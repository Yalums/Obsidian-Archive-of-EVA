凌·冬 翻译


"There was a dark little flame in her chest that wouldn’t go out. It stoked itself on the pleasure of possessing him, and his kindness was kindling to the fire. No matter what she tried, how she reminded herself of how damned they both were, it refused to die. Pathetic. Utterly pathetic, she thought. But still: she couldn’t help, in her quiet moments, as she lay with him or watched him hum as he cooked for her, as he held her, as she clawed him and kissed him, leaving marks that would brand him as hers, she couldn’t help at these times but to draw inside her chest for a moment and hold the flame in her hands. It burned, certainly, but it was beautiful and it was spreading."

“有一簇黑暗的小小火苗，在她的胸口潜伏不出。它趁着占有他的喜悦掇弄自己，他的温柔使它持续燃烧。无论有多少次她尝试，无论她如何提醒自己，他们两个多么糟糕不堪，它始终不肯熄灭。多可怜啊，多可悲，她心想。然而，某些时刻，她无法忍耐，当安静的时分，她依偎着他；当他为她做饭的时候听他哼歌，当他拥她入怀，当她擒吻着他，留下那标志着他属于她的印记，她忍不住会在心里描摹出火苗的样子，用双手捧住。当然很灼烫，但却是美丽的，而且还在蔓延。”

In the aftermath of Third Impact, Shinji and Asuka awake together and settle into the quiet agonies of waiting and redemption. As old friends reappear and their hearts heal, they begin to question the very nature of this reality...

在第三次冲击之后，Shinji和Asuka同时醒过来，面临着静默的等待和赎回之苦。当老朋友们先后复归，他们的心得到治愈，他们开始质疑这现实本身的存在性……

### Chapter 1: Autumn

A near constant dance of souls, interrupted only by brief sparks of dull sorrow and recognition.

近乎永恒的灵魂之舞，被空虚的悲伤和认知的短暂火花打断。

She remembered making cookies, once, with her mother. It seemed like eons ago. Worlds away. Practically a different galaxy now. She remembered making cookies: they rolled the dough out into a single sheet. They sliced shapes—little gingerbread men and women—and, freed from their primordial clay, the cookies hardened and swelled in the oven while she watched. She tugged at her mother’s apron—when would they be done? Soon, mein Schätzchen, soon.

她记起了从前有一次，她和妈妈一起做饼干。那好像是亘古以前，相隔了数条世界线，可以说完全不在一个平行宇宙内发生的事。她记得做饼干的过程：他们把生面团揉成薄薄的一片，切成小块——变成小小的姜饼小人——然后，她看着曲奇饼们脱离最初的陶土形态，在烤炉里变硬变大。她拉着妈妈的围裙——什么时候才算好呀？很快，mein Schätzchen（德语：我亲爱的），很快就好。

But this was cookies in reverse. The gingerbread men and women softened, melded and molded themselves back into clay, and rejoined the thick, undifferentiated mass. The distinctions between each cookie disappeared with pounding and pressing, and soon they were all the same.

但如今却是曾经的反过程。姜饼男女们变软，融化，把自己塑回泥土的样子，重新回到了厚厚的、无差别的一团混沌。在挤压碰撞中，每一块饼干之间的差别消失了，很快它们变得不分彼此。

Soon, they were not they, but it. You shouldn’t be able to reverse entropy—that was a basic tenet of thermodynamics (I explained it to him, once, she remembered) and yet, here they were.

很快，他们不再是他们，而是它。你不可能让熵值回溯——那是基本的热力学概念（我对他解释过，之前那一次，她还记得）然而现在，却实现了。

I hate this, Wondergirl. I want to go back. I hate that everyone can see… everything.

我讨厌这样，优等生。（-wondergirl，奇迹女孩？对应日语里的优等生称呼ww）我想回去。我不喜欢每个人都能看见……每件事。

Those stupid ruby eyes somehow managed to look smug, even here, even when their souls were interwoven, along with the rest of humanity. Save one soul, whose absence she had noticed almost immediately.

这双愚蠢的红宝石色的眼睛，甚至在这儿，在她们的灵魂和整个人类种族纠缠不分的时候，看上去还是有点儿自视甚高。每当一个灵魂获得新生，她几乎立刻能够意识到它的缺席。

But there’s no pain here. No sorrow. Nothing to divide you from others.

But that’s just it. I want those things.

但是这里没有痛苦。没有悲伤。没有什么可以使你与他人隔绝。

但也就只是这样罢了。正是我想要的。

You want to feel pain?

‘你想要感受痛苦？’

My whole life has been pain. It just doesn’t feel right otherwise.

我的一生都是痛苦的（虽然才活了十多年）。如果没了痛苦，反而不对头了。

The placid stare didn’t even blink.

凝视着她的温和眼睛甚至都没有眨过一回。

That was a joke. Kind of. I’m not sure I believe that the boundaries between souls have broken down if you didn’t even get that.

I got it. It just wasn’t very funny.

‘你有那么点像在说笑。其实灵魂之间的隔阂应该已经被拆除了——如果你还没有意识到这一点的话。’

我知道。只是觉得一点都不好笑。

She didn’t realize it, of course, but she was the only soul in all of humanity’s primordial soup to feel rage. The entire human race gave a gentle shudder.

其实，她没意识到，自己是所有人类原始之海中唯一感到盛怒的灵魂。整个人类种族都因为她而轻微地震荡了。

You know he left.

Who?

You know who I mean.

I don’t care. I don’t want to see him.

You’re lying.

‘你知道他不在。’

谁？

‘你知道我在说谁。’

我不管。我才不想见他。

‘你在撒谎。’

Shut up. Let’s cut to the chase. The part where you let me out.

Even after what he did to you—and what you did—

I don’t want your pity, okay? I just want out of this. Let me out, Wondergirl.

闭嘴。别兜圈子，咱们言归正传：放我出去。

即使在他对你做了那样的事——还有你做的种种——

我不想要你的同情，好吗？我只是离开这儿。放我走，优等生。

Finally, the red eyes widened. Then narrowed. This felt—warm. Somewhere inside. Or outside. It wasn’t like she had a body anymore.（-who？）

终于，红色的眼睛睁大了。又眯成缝。这感觉——很温暖。仿佛是在什么地方的里面，或者是外面。自己的身体像是不复存在。

Why did you think I was pitying you? I’m relieved.

Shut up, okay? I just want to go back. I don’t care what happened. I do care, but I want to go back. Let me go back.

‘为什么你会觉得我在同情你呢？ 我已经解脱了。’（想表达的是大白丽已经不再有人的情感了，所以自然也没有同情）*已经额外又找人核实了这句的翻译应该没问题了。

闭上嘴好吗？我只想回去。我才不管那么多哩。虽然我也在乎，但我还是想回去。让我回去吧。

It’s not up to me, Asuka. Every soul here can return if they want to.

Then I’m out. Seriously. Cool experiment, but I’m done with you, I’m done with NERV, I’m done with this Instrumentality bullshit, I’m done.

‘决定权不在我，明日香。每个灵魂都可以凭自己的意愿决定去留。’（稍微意译了一下....）

那我就走了。我认真的。这实验虽然很酷，但我已经受够你了，我受够NERV了，我受够这个垃圾补完计划了，我受够了。

But you’re not done with Ikari.

‘但你还没有受够碇君。’

Shut up.

You know he’s alone.

I said, shut up—

闭嘴。

‘你知道他是一个人。’

我说了，闭嘴——

She pressed forward and reached the crux of her thesis.

You know, Asuka, that he’s got no one else and the idea of being everything to someone, even someone who betrayed you—

Rei, please, please, I’m asking you to shut up. Please. Don’t be cruel.

Take care of him, then. And yourself.

她继续施压，找到了她观点的核心：

‘你知道，明日香，他没有人可依靠，你就是他的全部，即使他背叛过你——’

丽，别说了，拜托，我求你闭上嘴。拜托了。别那么残忍。

‘那，照顾好他，还有你自己。’

Asuka felt—like Asuka again. Even as she talked to Rei—still an outgrowth of the swirling miasma of disintegrated human consciousnesses—she felt the comforting return of absences: suddenly, the myriad lives and experiences and sorrows and joys all around her were distant cries. And then, they fell silent.

明日香觉得，自己又重新变回明日香了。甚至当她和丽——仍然是一团旋转不休的、崩离的、人类混合意识的衍生物——交谈时，她也能感受到从他们当中离开的舒适：一时之间，数以亿计的生活经历喜悦伤悲皆围绕着她持续呼喊，在这之后，它们全都安静了。

“Rei,” Asuka asked, and she gave a soft gasp when she heard her voice—her own voice—once more. “Can I ask one last question?”

“丽,”明日香问。她再次听见声音——她自己的声音时，她轻轻吸了一口气。“我能最后问一个问题吗？”

The eyes softened. Was she going to cry? Which one of them was crying? Maybe both?

那双眼睛变得柔和。她要哭了吗？是哪只眼睛要哭了？也许都要？

Of course.

“Are you God?”

‘当然。’

“你是神吗？”

I… don’t know.

Asuka nodded.

“It sounds like that’s a no, then. Since you’re not omniscient and all that. By definition.”

‘我……不知道。’

明日香点头。

“那就不是了。因为你并非全知全能。从定义上说。”

‘I think the truth is more complicated and frightening than that, Asuka.’

我认为真相可能比那更复杂，也更吓人，明日香。

She would have liked to ask Rei more. Finally, she got the blue-haired doll to open up a bit, even if it took the world ending and humanity collapsing inward on itself to do it. She’d studied philosophy once upon a time—it really hadn’t been that long ago, had it? Didn’t Nietzsche have a part about this? Vielleicht sollen sie auf Deutsch diskutieren—

她本想要问丽更多问题。终于，她可以让这个蓝发的洋娃娃女孩稍微敞开点心扉了，虽然代价是世界灭绝，人性坍塌回了原点。她有一次研究过哲学——应该不是很久之前才对。难道Nietzsche（-尼采）没有提到过类似的观点吗？Vielleicht sollen sie auf Deutsch diskutieren—（-也许他们应该用德语来交谈这件事）

The discussion would have to wait, however, because in that moment, Asuka realized she was real, once more. She had a body. Her body ached. Everything ached. And the hands around her neck, the thumbs digging into her windpipe, the sweaty palms crushing the muscles of her throat—they ached most of all.

不过，这个话题得留着以后再说，因为在那个时刻，明日香意识到她重新变得有血有肉了。她有了身体。她的身体疼痛不已。每一处都疼得要命。还有双手掐着她的脖子，拇指深深地嵌进她的气管，汗涔涔的掌心将她喉部的肌肉按扁了——这些肌肉是最疼的。

That bastard. That idiot. His stupid face. She reached for it. She wanted to speak to him—scream at him, tell him to go to hell, tell him to kill himself, tell him how badly she hated him, how irredeemably he’d broken her. That he’d choke her, but he wouldn’t hold her—but she had no breath with which to speak.

那个蠢货。那个笨蛋。他愚蠢的脸。她伸出手去。她想要朝他说话——冲他叫嚣，告诉他快点去死吧，快点滚下地狱去，告诉他自己有多恨他，他打碎了她的心，无处挽回。他掐住她的喉咙，却不肯抱她——但她无法呼吸，所以哪句话都说不出来。

Instead, her hand moved as if on its own. It found his cheek and she rested it there. It was a small thing, but the warmth of his flesh, the softness of his skin… After feeling nothing for who knows how long, it was practically a feast. His grip went slack and a soft trickle of air wormed into her lungs.

她的手却和她的想法相反，好像自己有意志似的动了起来，找到他的脸颊，停留其上。那是一个小小的举动，但是他身体的温暖，他皮肤的柔软……经历了鬼知道有多久的毫无知觉，这样的触感就像一场盛宴。他的手垮了下来，一小簇空气轻柔地灌入她的肺。

His head bowed. Crying. Sobs. Idiot, she thought. It’s just like you to make this all about you.

他的头低垂了。哭泣。抽噎。白痴。显得像我做的这一切都是为了你似的，她心想。

“I feel gross,” she muttered. Wondergirl’s stupid face—half of it, at least—smirked at them. Or at nothing in particular. From across the sea of LCL. Maybe coming back hadn’t been such a great idea.

“真恶心。”她嘟囔着。优等生愚蠢的脸——只有一半——从LCL海的对岸对他们诡笑着（参考eoe结尾大白丽的表情，她不是真的在笑，牵动面部的肌肉导致她的唇角上扬可能更适合形容那个表情hhh 不过诡笑这个词也不是非常恰当，或许展开说成“诡异地笑着”更合适)。或者是对着虚空。也许回来也不是什么好主意。

She shoved him with her good hand and started to lean forward. A strangled gasp of pain spilled out of her chapped lips.

“Shinji, help me.”

她用完好的手推开他，然后往前倾身。扭曲的痛苦涌溢而出，她干裂的唇发出一阵喘息。

“真嗣，帮帮我。”

He kept crying. Idiot—what was this all for, then?

他还在哭。笨蛋——哭有什么用呢？

“Did you go deaf in there?” she scowled. “My body is all messed up. Help me up. Quick. Come on. We’re not in that kitchen anymore. This is real. Just help me.”

“你是聋了吗？”她斥道，“我的身子全都糟透了。扶我起来。快点。来啊。我们已经不在那个餐厅里了。这是现实。来帮帮我。”

Still, the tears. She’d have to do everything herself, like always. His forehead rested against her belly, quaked with each sob, and she managed to swat him, seizing a fistful of hair.

眼泪，还是眼泪。老样子，她依然得自力更生。他的额头抵着她的肚子，随着每声抽泣而震颤不休。她设法打了他一下，抓住他的一簇头发。

“Shinji, you idiot, help me stand up.” She licked her lips but everything was dry. “Listen, I’m gonna’ be sick. Sick. You get it?”

“真嗣，你这笨蛋，扶我站起来。”她舔着嘴唇，但一切都是干瘪的。“听着，我要犯恶心了。恶心。你懂不懂？”

She saw understanding in his pink eyes. He took hold of her and she shuddered—not from the pain—but his touch was light as he pulled her to her feet.

她看见他的红眼睛有了理解的意思。他抓住她的手，她颤抖——不是因为疼——而是他把她拉起来时，他的触摸很轻盈。

“Good. Help me over to the shore.”

He obeyed, wordless as he shifted her good arm around his shoulders. He started to put an arm around his waist.

“好。现在扶我去岸边。”

他遵从了，一言不发，他将她完好的那只手搭在他肩头。他的手环住她的腰侧。

“Um, like this? Is this okay?”

“It’s fine,” she grunted.

“Asuka, I’m sorry. I’m so, so, so sorry. I’m so sorry. I know—I know there’s nothing I can do—“

“呃，像这样？这样可以吗？”

“可以。”她闷声说。

“明日香，对不起。真的，真的，真的很对不起。太对不起了。我知道——我知道我什么都做不了——”

“Shut up. I didn’t come back to this—literally—god-forsaken world—just to hear you apologize.”

“I know but…”

“闭嘴，我来到这个——字面意思上——遭天谴的世界，可不是为了听你道歉！”

“我知道，但是……”

“We’ll talk about it later.” They had reached the water’s edge. Not water, she reminded herself, with grim pleasure. The souls of all humanity.

“我们以后会谈到的。”他们来到海的边缘。不是海水，她带着阴郁的满足感提醒自己。这些都是全人类的灵魂。

In shaking spurts, she sank to her knees and leaned forward.

她颤巍巍地小步向前一跳，跪倒下去。

“I hate all of you,” she whispered to the entire human race, and vomited. It was bile—Rei apparently hadn’t seen fit to recreate her with a full stomach, though she had made sure to include the almost-fresh wounds and—and—and—the thing growing inside her

“我讨厌你们所有人。”她对着人类一族轻声说道，然后呕吐。吐的是胆汁——丽显然没有在造她的时候给她一个健全的肠胃，虽然她很细心地造出了几乎是新鲜的伤口，还有，还有，还有——从她内心膨胀起来的东西。

“Shinji,” she sputtered. “Don’t just stand there. Hold my hair.”

“Oh. Sorry.”

“真嗣，”她急促地说，“别干站着，抓住我的头发。”

“噢。抱歉。”

She felt his fingers slide through her hair. Gentle. She hated how gentle he was being. As if he might break her. As if he hadn’t already. As if he hadn’t done what she’d done, once, that night months ago—

她感到他的手指滑入她的发丝间。动作温柔。她讨厌他这么温柔。仿佛他可能会弄碎她。就像他不是已经这么做了一样。就像他没有做那件她以前早做过的，曾经，在几个月以前的夜晚——

Again, and again, and again, she puked, till her throat screamed. Her entire being was pain and nausea.

一次又一次，一次又一次，她吐着，直到她的嗓子冒烟了。她全身都疼痛不堪，恶心反胃。

“This last one is for your dad, Shinji,” she muttered and pitched forward one last time. “I think I got him.”

“Good aim.”

“最后一口是吐给你爸的，真嗣，”她闷声说，最后往前呕了一次，“我想我吐到他身上了。”

“好目标。”

“Sorry if I got your mom too. Or my mom. Or Misato. Maybe I hit Rei—that’s okay.”

“I’m sure Ayanami will forgive you.”

She held up her arms.

“不好意思也吐到你妈妈身上了。或者我妈妈。或者美里。可能我也击中了丽——没关系。”

“我确定绫波会原谅你的。”

她抬起双臂。

“I can’t walk just yet. Up.”

“我还走不动。扶我。”

He was all too quick to oblige. He squatted, threaded his arms under her knees. He had trouble standing back up, though, and she pushed them forward with her good arm as she pressed in with her weight. That still didn’t work, so she used her legs to push off and then, with a quick little leap, wrapped them around her waist.

他顺从得太迅速了。蹲下，把手揽入她的双膝，虽然站起来的时候有点麻烦。她用完好的手撑地把他们往前推，把她自身的体重压到他身上。还是没成功，所以她用上了脚，迅速地一跳，紧勾住他的腰。

Shinji didn’t question how she could manage that maneuver while being unable to walk, and she wasn’t about to defend it.

真嗣没问为什么她可以作蹬腿，却不能走路，她也没打算反驳。

She rested her chin in the crook of his neck. Smelled the sweat and the coppery tinge of blood still clinging to their skin. Almost let her lips touch his ear.

I’m pathetic.

她把下巴搭在他弯曲的颈部上。闻着汗味和仍然粘在皮肤上的几滴血的铜锈味。几乎要让她的嘴唇贴着他的耳朵。

我真可怜。

~

It was a long way to walk to find somewhere that had resisted the tides of LCL. A few times, Shinji had stopped in front of an apartment building or a house and Asuka had nixed it—didn’t look clean, she’d say, or didn’t look sturdy. He wasn’t sure he agreed with her, but even though his arms ached from carrying her, he didn’t feel like he was in any position to argue with her.

走到能拦住LCL的海潮的地方还有好长的路。有几次，真嗣会在一栋公寓或者一座房屋前停下来，但是明日香不同意——她要么说看上去不干净，要么就说不稳定。他不确定自己是否同意她，但尽管他的手臂背得快要断了，他也不觉得自己有任何权利跟她争辩。

Not after what he’d done to her.

Three sins, all intertwined. There were more, of course, but those felt like part of the tapestry of their relationship, whatever it had been. Those sins hadn’t torn the tapestry（织锦，锦缎） itself（-是俗语还是？）参考英文的修辞手法metaphor（隐喻，不在被比作的事物之前加like），他在借织物形容“复杂和相互交错的程度”。 like these had.

自他对她做了那些事以后。

有三项罪过，全部互相纠缠。当然还有更多，但不管是什么，只是给他们本就错综复杂的关系雪上加霜罢了。那些罪并没有像这三项罪过那样。

Moving backwards in time—choking her, of course. She’d mentioned the kitchen—so she’d seen it too, in there. Maybe he could play it off that he thought they were still there, in the lake, in the hell custom-built for two. But that wasn’t entirely the truth. Part of it, sure—but some other part of him suspected, even knew that they were free, and that same part knew what came next. The talking. The accusations. The crying. The blame. The guilt. The pain. Everything that came with knowing other people. And his reaction had been…

时间往前回溯——他掐了她，当然了。她提到了厨房，所以她肯定也在那个地方见证了他的作为。或许他可以糊弄说，他以为他们还在湖里，在那个见鬼的二人世界里。但那不完全是真相。一部分是真的——但还有一部分令他怀疑，即使知道了他们已经自由，他依然还是会重蹈覆辙。那些对话。那些指控。哭泣。责难。愧疚。痛苦。这一切都来自于和他人接触。而他的回应却是……

The second sin, no matter which way you approached it, was one of inaction. He knew what had happened that day, and even though her body had been put back together, her scars hadn’t healed. He’d seen the memory, while in the lake, replayed in her mind—all of humanity’s mind now—over and over, felt the pain of being ripped to shreds by the mass-produced monsters. He could have stopped it. He’d ignored her cries. Or, rather, he had tried not to hear them.

第二项罪过，不管他是什么方式达到的，都可归结于不作为。他知道那一天发生了什么，即使她的身体被拼合回去了，她的伤疤还是没有治愈。在湖里的生活，他看见了她脑海里回放的记忆——现在是全人类的脑海了——反反复复，感受着被量产机怪兽撕扯剥拽成碎片的痛苦。他本可以阻止这件事。他却无视了她的呐喊。或者说，他试图当做没有听见。

Because of the first sin. The original sin. The sin where he locked the door to her hospital room. Hoisted himself on top of her. Kissed her sleeping lips and dared her to wake up and see what he was doing to her. Ached for it, if only she would react to him. If only she’d prove he weren’t alone.

是因为那第一项罪恶。原罪。这罪就是，他把她病房的门锁了起来，撑着身子爬到她上面，亲吻熟睡的她的双唇，逼她醒来，看看他对她做了什么好事。他渴求着，如果她能给些反应就好了！如果她能证明他不是孤零零的一个人就好了。

But she hadn’t. He couldn’t even find tears as he’d cleaned her up, as best he could, rearranged her pillow and covered her. Wiped her off, first with his hand, and then a wash cloth. He’d thought of throwing himself out the window right then, but he hadn’t even had the courage for that.

但她没醒。当他尽他所能清洁她的身体，重新铺好枕头，盖上被子时，他甚至找不到一滴眼泪。他先用手擦拭她，再用毛巾。他本想跳出窗户一死了之的，结果他连那赴死的勇气都没有。

And she knew all of this. He’d expected her hatred, but somehow, this tenderness cut even worse. When he felt himself reaching pits of despair he hadn’t even imagined, even in the darkest days and nights of piloting the Eva, he found her arms holding him tighter. As if—instructing him. This is what I wanted, idiot, she seemed to be saying with her mutilated limbs.

她肯定知道所有的事。他本以为她会恨他，但不知怎的，这份温柔反而更令他心碎。当他体会到了从未想象过的，哪怕是最黑暗的昼夜里驾驶着EVA都比不上的绝望时，他却发现她的双臂抱他更紧了。就好像——在教导他：这就是我要的，笨蛋，她似乎在用她残缺的肢体传达这个意思。

“We could always go back to Misato’s,” he said, finally. The sun—as it were—seemed to be setting. Would the electric grid still be operational? Maybe—so much was automated these days. As if the architects and urban planners rebuilding after Second Impact had predicted this.

“我们任何时候都可以回到美里小姐的家。”终于，他说道。太阳——一如既往——马上就要落山了。电网还在正常运转吗？也许吧——毕竟这些年来什么都是自动化了。就像建筑学家和城市规划者在第二次冲击后重建时已经预料到了这一点。

“We might as well,” she said. “Our stuff is there. I want to change out of this thing.”

“那我们就去吧。”她说，“我们的东西都在那里。我想要换掉这家伙。”

The plug suit. There was a time when she had been so proud to wear it. The artificial skin that still transmitted her warmth, even though he was the last person in the world to deserve it. And now—a useless, sticky remembrance of a time that would never come again. A second placenta,（胎盘） he realized, and he was about to point that out to her when he realized she was still talking.

战斗服。曾经有段时间她是如此骄傲能穿上它。人造皮肤仍然在传递她的热量，尽管他是世界上最不值得这份温暖的人。现在，这只是一件无用的、碍事的东西，提醒着以后永远不会再到来的时光。简直是第二个胎盘。（-注：这里类似于重新出生，战斗服作为胎盘一样的寓意）他意识到，正当他想指出来时，发现她还在讲话。

“…weird without people around,” she mumbled. “Why did we come back? I thought others would too. Soon.”

“I don’t know.”

“……一个人都没有，好奇怪啊。”她低声念叨，“为什么我们会回来呢？我以为其他人也会回来。应该比我们还快。”

“我不知道。”

“Why did you come back?”

“Don’t you know?”

“To carry me around for the rest of my natural life in penance?”

He winced and she jabbed him with her elbow.

“You’re getting off easy, Third Child.”

“I know I am. I still feel bad.”

“那你为什么回来？”

“你不知道？”

“为了在我余下的生命里，背着我东奔西跑来赎你的罪？”

他畏缩了，她用胳膊肘戳了戳他。

“你也太容易被调侃了，第三适格者。”

“我知道，我还是感觉很糟糕。”

“Idiot. You should, though.”

“Don’t worry. I do.”

“You were really, really dumb, you know. If I’d been awake—“

“笨蛋。虽然你活该如此。”

“别担心，我早就觉得了。”

“你真的，真的好迟钝啊，你自己也知道吧。如果我那时还醒着——”

He winced again and she seemed to waver before plunging forward. He expected a dagger to the heart but instead—

他又畏缩了，她似乎左右晃了一下，往前倾身。他做好了被恶语穿心的准备，没想到——

“I would have been okay with it, you know. That’s what makes you so stupid. If you’d just—tried, a little(译文没问题w)…” His head drooped and he felt her swallow hard by his ear. “But, I mean, I understand. I’m pretty insufferable. No one loves me. You’re really getting what you deserve, you know? Stuck on a dead planet with me and only me. I’ve been living it for almost fifteen years and it’s hell.”

“我可能还是会容让你的，你知道。就是这件事才让你显得这么地傻。如果你当时试着……多一点……”他的脑袋恹恹低垂，感觉到她在耳旁用力吞口水，“但是，我的意思是，我理解你。我天生恼人厌，所以没人喜欢我。你只是得到了应得的份，你明白吗？跟我一起被塞在同一个死寂的星球上，而且只有我。我已经活了将近十五年了，知道这儿是个人间地狱。”

“Asuka,” he whispered. “Don’t talk like that. I don’t hate you.”

“Yes,” she whispered back, as if they were sharing a secret. “You do. And I hate you. But I hate myself most of all, so in a way, you’re my favorite person.” She leaned her head back and Shinji heard a soft chorus of sharp cracks as Asuka grunted. “Isn’t that sick?”

“明日香，”他小声说，“别这样说。我一点都不讨厌你。”

“不，”她轻声怼（这个字用得很好ww）回来，就像他们在分享一个秘密，“你讨厌的很。而且我也讨厌你。但我最讨厌的是我自己，所以这样子一来，你就成了我最喜欢的人了。”她把脑袋缩回去，真嗣听见少许支离破碎的喉音轻轻附和着她的咕哝声：一声支离破碎的尖笑，就像轻柔的合音，咕哝着：“是不是很恶俗？”

“If it helps, I feel the same way.”

“Really?”

“如果这么说能帮到你的话，我也有同样的感觉。”

“真的？”

“I don’t think I hate you at all, actually, but—myself—I don’t know if I can ever love myself,” he said as they turned onto the silent block where they’d lived for those few months that somehow felt like lifetimes ago. “I think I hate myself right now. Maybe I will forever. But I don’t hate you at all.”

“虽然我一点都不讨厌你，但是——我自己——我都不知道是不是能够喜欢自己，”他说，当他们走上住了几个月的寂静的街区时，不知怎么的，感觉就像是几辈子前的事了，“我现在非常讨厌自己。也许以后都会讨厌下去。但我绝不会讨厌你。”

“That’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.”

“No way.”

“Really.”

“That’s impossible. You were always so great.”

“那是人能对我说的最动听的话了。”

“不可能。”

“真的。”

“怎么可能，你一直都很厉害。”

Shinji felt her grip tighten.

“Don’t say that, please.”

真嗣感到她的手收紧了。

“别这样说，拜托了。”

“But it’s true! You’re so smart, and you worked so hard. And in the end you…” Shinji stopped. Of course, her greatest victory was also her most painful defeat. Maybe I really am as stupid as she says I am, he thought with a sad little sigh.

“是真的！你是那么聪明，又那么努力。但到头来你……”真嗣停住了。自然，她最伟大的胜利也是最痛苦的惨败。也许我真的就像她说的那么笨，他想着，悲伤地叹了口气。

One piece of luck shone through for both of them: they had arrived at the apartment block. When Shinji tapped in the key code, the doors clicked open. The lights in the lobby flickered now and then, but otherwise…

Everything was the same.

零星一点幸运之光终于照耀了两人：他们来到了公寓街区。真嗣按完门锁密码，门弹开了。走廊上的灯一闪一暗，但除此以外……

一切如常。

“We’re home,” they said in unison, stepping into the tiny apartment. They waited for a moment.

“我们回来了。”他们一齐说道，踏入了公寓的小套间。接着停顿了一会儿。

“Somehow, I thought Misato might be here,” Shinji said.

“Whatever happened to her?”

“You didn’t see?”

“不知怎么回事，我还以为美里小姐会在这里呢。”真嗣说。

“她经历了什么？”

“你没看见吗？”

“I guess I missed it. It was hard to see any one thing at once in there.”

“They shot her. While she was trying to get me to Unit One. To save you.”

Shinji watched her nostrils flare （鼻翼微微张开，这个表达方式通常是用在描写人试图伪装情绪/说谎时的）很多介绍‘How to Recognize Someone is Lying/Deceiving’的段落中均有提到这个词. He helped her to sit down at the dining room table—the one he’d overturned, in their mutual dream.

“我想我错过了。在那个地方很难一次只注意一件事。”

“他们用枪射了她。她想要带我到初号机里去。为了救你。”

真嗣看见她的鼻翼细微地抽动了一下。然后扶着她坐到餐厅桌旁——就是那个他们共享的梦境里他推翻的那个桌子。

“I’m glad you made her death worth it.”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize unless you mean it. Unless you’re going to change. Do you get it? That’s what pisses me off the most about you.”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“我很高兴你没让她的努力白费。”

“我知道。对不起。”

“别道歉了，除非你是真心实意的。除非你真的想作出改变。你听懂了吗？我最烦的就是你这个样子。”

“我知道。对不起。”

“See? That!”

Shinji hung his head. He noticed Asuka recoil and their eyes met. Suddenly, they were both laughing.

“I seriously thought you were going to do it for a second.”

“Sorry.”

“听见没？就是这个样子！”

真嗣抬起了头，他们的双目相遇后，他发现明日香畏缩了一下。突然间，他们两个都笑了起来。

“有一秒钟我真的以为你又要动手了。”

“对不起。”

“There you go again.”

“I promise I won’t choke you again.”

“Well, that makes me feel better,” Asuka murmured. “Misato really deserved better. She gave us everything, didn’t she? I was such a bitch to her.”

“I wasn’t much better.”

“还来。”

“我保证我再也不会掐你了。”

“嗯，这倒是让我感觉好些了。”明日香喃喃道，“美里值得更好的。她对我们尽心尽责，我对她的态度却像个婊子。”

“我也没好哪儿去。”

“You cooked for her. You tried to take care of her. Both of us. You were more of a housewife than she or I could ever be. I was just…”

“You really didn’t see any of it? When she died?”

“Like I said.”

“你给她做饭，试着照顾她方方面面，也照顾我。你比她或我都更像个家庭主妇。我只是……”

“你真的什么都没看见吗？就是她死之前？”

“我不是说过，我什么都没看见。”

“She kissed me,” Shinji said, tucking his hand behind his head. “And told me she’d show me the rest when it was all over.”

“她吻了我。”真嗣说，一只手扶到脑后头，“然后对我说当事情都结束了，就继续进行剩下的。”

He watched her lips form a sneer and then soften.

“That means she knew she was dying.”

“Right.”

他看见她的嘴唇先是作讥讽的模样，后又变得柔和了。

“这说明她知道她要死了。”

“对的。”

“I bet you would have preferred her here. Over me. Maybe she’ll wake up out of the ooze（这个词特指某些东西从那种谜之液体中缓慢地、黏稠地渗出来的过程....ewww） and come to you and you two can kick me out on the street and have a little slice of heaven all to yourself.”

“Or she’ll be so disgusted with me that she’ll kick me out and you’ll both starve to death.”

“我打赌，比起我，你肯定更愿意她在这儿。也许她会从那些难以形容的液体里爬出来找你，你们同心协力把我一脚踹到大街上，从此过上了极乐天堂的日子。”

“或许她根本没法忍受我这个糟粕，反而把我踹了出去，你俩从此过上了忍饥挨饿的日子。”

Two tired sets of eyes met once more.

“Mein Gott, but we’re really screwed up.”

两双疲惫的眼睛再一次相遇。

“Mein Gott（-上帝啊），我们两个真是烂透了。”

Before Shinji could say anything, a chorus of frantic squeals came from the other room, growing louder and louder until, finally, the chorus leader—a squat bird flapping its useless wings as if trying to catch a taxi on a rainy Tokyo evening—found them.

在真嗣刚想说什么之前，一阵合声般的疯癫尖叫从另一个房间传来，而且越来越响。终于，这位和声歌唱家出现并找到了他们——那只矮墩墩的企鹅，像是要在东京的雨夜里拦下一部计程车似的扇着它无用的翅膀。

“Pen-Pen!” Asuka gasped. “You’re alive!”

The bird flung itself towards her and heaved itself into her lap. She squeezed his belly and he honked, glowering at Shinji.（-这里的penpen为什么怒视真嗣？愤怒/不赞许的情绪——“嘿！瞧瞧小姑娘现在的样子，你根本就没照顾好她！”by penpen语十级翻译员川川（不是））*一边冲明日香撒娇一边默默地鄙视了一下真嗣哈哈哈哈...根据前文，家里应该是没有乱掉的。所以penpen生气的点应该是在于asuka负伤的模样

“Pen-Pen！”明日香吸了一口气，“你还活着！”

这只鸟飞扑向她，钻到她的膝盖中间。在她用力揉搓他肚皮的时候嘎嘎叫着，顺带愤怒地瞟了真嗣一眼。

“I wonder how long he was alone. It makes sense that animals didn’t disappear too, doesn’t it?”

“It feels like he didn’t lose much weight,” Asuka said, squeezing him again.

“我想知道他孤零零呆在这儿多久了。不过这证明了动物好像不会跟着消失，不是吗？”

“看起来没怎么瘦嘛。”明日香说着又挤了挤Pen-Pen。

“Well, he can get into the fridge by himself. And I think Misato went shopping the day before—it all happened.”

Asuka leaned back and winced. “Everyone had plans. Even Misato. She really thought up until the end that we might come back and all have dinner together.”

“Maybe. Or maybe she was trying to fool herself. I wouldn’t put that past her. None of us were doing well at the end.”用英文解释会更好理解：put something past someone = would not be suprised if someone doing something bad. *特指一些负面的事情

“唔，他可以自己到冰箱找吃的。我想美里小姐去过超市，就在——事情发生的前一天。”

明日香往后靠着，缩起身子。“每个人都有自己的打算。美里也不例外。她直到最后也想着我们会团聚，并一起吃晚饭。”

“也许吧。或者她可能只想麻痹自己。如果她真的是这么想的，我一点也不会惊讶。毕竟在那时候我们的状态都很糟糕。”

“The sick thing,” Asuka said, stroking Pen-Pen’s head. “Is that it wasn’t the end. Your dad really fucked everyone.”

“最恶心的，”明日香一边说，一边戳着Pen-Pen的脑袋，“不是结局怎样，而是你爹把所有人都操了一通。”

He couldn’t disagree with that. Asuka set Pen-Pen down and the bird began to waddle over to the fridge.

“Hey, Shinji.”

“Yeah?”

他不能更同意。明日香把Pen-Pen放在地上，企鹅开始摇摇摆摆地走向冰箱。

“嘿，真嗣。”

“什么事？”

She leaned forward on the table, resting her weight on her elbows. Her face shone in the scarlet twilight—moist with sweat and LCL, her one whole eye devouring him, an angry goddess come down from heaven to make things right on Earth. Beauty wasn’t the word for it—sublime, perhaps?

她朝桌子俯身，把身子的一部分重量枕在胳膊肘上。她的脸反射着猩红色的暮光，混合着汗水和LCL，她的独眼将他吞没，像一位震怒的女神从天而降，使地上的万物重回正轨。形容美丽并不合适——也许用“崇高庄重”更好。

“I haven’t forgiven you. I just wanted you to know that.”

“I didn’t think you had. I don’t expect you to. I know there’s nothing I can—“

“Shut up. I’m not done.”

“Sorry.”

“我还没原谅你。我只想让你知道这一点。”

“我没觉得你会，也没期望过你会。我知道没有什么是我能——”

“闭嘴。我还没说完呢。”

“对不起。”

“Remember what I said about that?”

“Sorry.”

“记得我说过的话吗？”

“对不起。”

“You’re doing that on purpose now. Shut up and listen. I don’t forgive you. I shouldn’t forgive you. But I might, because I’m an idiot too. But if you want me to forgive you, and there’s still only a .0001% chance of that ever happening, even if you do everything right, but if you want that chance, then listen: you’re my slave. For the rest of your life. You do what I say. You help me. You’re here for me. Not that it’ll be hard if we’re all that’s left, but you never look at another woman. （-Not和but的关系？这里的not that应该是指nothing，完整的句式=nothing if not, but something，来强调一种extreme level，从中文语序考虑把“不准想”的那句合并在这里）You don’t even think about another woman. I’m all you have. I’m all you live for. Got it?”

“你现在是故意的了！闭上嘴听着，我既没原谅你，也不觉得我应该原谅你。但我可能会，因为我也是个笨蛋。你想要我原谅，即使你做对了每一件事，也只有0.0001%的概率会发生这种情况。但如果你真想得到那个机会，那就听好：从今往后，你永远做我的奴隶。我说什么你就做什么，我让你帮忙你就帮忙。你一直都要陪在我身边。这世上只剩下你我了，你再也不会看到、当然也不许想到其他女人——所以只对我一个人唯命是从并不困难。我就是你活在这里的理由。（*考虑到“一个人”的使用频率，修改了一下表达方式）明白了吗？”

Shinji felt dizzy. Light. He reached for her hand and she took it, squeezed it.

“We’re not back in the kitchen, Shinji. I’m real. You’re real. This is what I want. You hurt me worse than anyone else ever has. Ever will.”

真嗣感觉脑袋晕乎乎，身体轻飘飘的。他去摸她的手，她握住了，用力捏了捏。

“我们现在不在餐厅了，真嗣。我是真的。你也是真的。这就是我想要的。你伤害我的程度比我以前遇到的，比我今后将会遇到的人都要深。”

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“Then prove it.”

“我知道。我很抱歉。”

“那就证明一下。”

“Okay.”

“Say it.”

“Say what?”

“好。”

“你要说出来。”

“说什么？”

“’Asuka, I’m yours, forever and ever, till the end of time.’”

“Asuka, I’m yours, forever and ever, till the end of time.”

“’No matter how fucked up you are.’”

“‘明日香，我愿永远属于你，海枯石烂不分离。’”

“明日香，我愿永远属于你，海枯石烂不分离。”

“‘不论你有多下贱。’”

“But I don’t think you’re fucked up. Really—I think this is a reasonable response to—“

“但我不觉得你下贱。真的，我觉得你对我的反应很合——”

“Say it, idiot.”

“No matter how fucked up you are.”

“说出来，笨蛋。”

“不论你有多下贱。”

“’I’ll be your slave, I’ll do whatever you want, and my only concerns shall be for your happiness, impossible though it may be.’”

“I’ll be your slave. I’ll do whatever you want. And, uh, my only concerns shall be for your happiness, impossible though it may be.”

“‘我愿作你的奴隶，我将听命于你，我只为你的幸福考虑，哪怕它可能无法实现。’”

“我愿作你的奴隶，我将听命于你，我只为你的幸福考虑，哪怕它可能无法实现。”

She took a deep breath and released his hand.

“I’m even more pathetic than you are.”

“Asuka, I don’t think you’re pathetic.”

她深深地吸了一口气，然后松开他的手。

“我甚至比你想得还要可怜。”

“明日香，我不觉得你可怜。”

“What a pathetic thing to say. You don’t pity me?”

“No! I—I feel bad. For what I did. I pity myself, but not you.”

“Do you think I should feel bad? For what I did to you? That time?”

“真是一句悲哀的话，你都不舍得同情一下我？”

“不！我——我只是感觉很内疚。因为我做的那些事。我同情我自己，但不是你。”

“你觉得我应该内疚吗？就是那次，我对你做了那件事？”

He cocked his head to the side. “What do you mean?”

How could he not know?

他把头朝一边歪。“你是指哪件事？”

他怎么会想不起来呢？

“It’s fine. Never mind. Just don’t let your self-pitying get in the way of serving me.”

He managed a slight smile. “Whatever you want, Asuka. Can I, uh, get you anything?”

“没事。别在意。只是别让你的自我同情干涉到服务我的态度上。”

他试图挤出一个微小的笑容。“随时奉命，明日香。你需要，呃，我帮你拿些什么吗？”

“Good question. Yes, you can. I’m going to take a shower. Then, I’ll need stuff for wound care. Antiseptic. Something to numb the pain. Bandages and gauze. Petroleum jelly. Stuff like that.”

“好问题。没错，你需要。我要去洗澡了。然后，我需要一些消毒剂、止痛的药、绷带、纱布和凡士林之类的东西来处理伤口。”

“I can go to the pharmacy down the street. It might be locked, but I don’t think anyone will care if I break in.”

“Good boy,” she said. She took a breath and heaved herself to her feet. Shinji started to reach for her but she waved his hands away. “It’s fine. I can do it.”

“我可以去一趟街头的药店。药店可能锁住了，但我破窗进去应该也没人会怪我。”

“好孩子。”她说。她吸了口气，把自己撑起来。真嗣想要搀扶她，她却挥开了他的手。“不要紧，我自己可以。”

She only grimaced once or twice while crossing the room. All without his help.

“Hey, Shinji.”

“Yeah?”

“Um, my body.”

在没有真嗣的帮助下穿过房间时，她也全力克制，只是因着强烈的痛感偶尔露出扭曲的表情。

“嘿，真嗣。”

“什么事？”

“唔，我的身体。”

In spite of everything,(you got it!! yey!) his cheeks went red. He looked to see if she was making fun of him but her gaze was locked on the floor.

尽管经历了那么多，他的脸颊还是一热。他仔细望着明日香，想知道她是不是要寻乐子，但她的目光只是停留在地面上。

“What about it?”

“It’s gonna’ be different now. You saw it, right? In the hospital?”

“Um, yeah.”

“身体怎么了？”

“比以前不一样了。你看见了对吧？在医院的时候？”

“呃，是的。”

“Good. If you, uh, ever see me naked, I want you to remember that, instead of what it looks like now, okay?”

“Asuka, I’m sure—“

“好。如果你，呃，见到我光着身子，我想要你记住那个时候的样子，而不是现在的模样，懂了吗？”

“明日香，我可以肯定——”

“Shinji,” she growled. “What was our agreement?”

He bit his tongue and nodded.

“I’ll, uh, remember that, instead.”

“真嗣，”她低吼道，“我们之间的协议是什么？”

他咬住舌头，点了点头。

“我，呃，我会记住你那时的样子。”

“And we’ll pretend that’s what I look like, instead.”

“We’ll pretend. It’ll be no different.”

“Good.”

“然后我们就假装这就是我现在的模样。”

“我们就假装，跟以前一模一样。”

“这就对了。”

~

She stripped off the plug suit like peeling the skin off an over-ripe fruit. It didn’t hurt, much, but the sight of it, watching the suit tug at her sticky wounds, that was far worse than any pain. Asuka watched her body reveal itself, inch by inch, and she only realized she was crying when she saw tears dripping onto one of the long, angry red scars that ran the length of her gut.

她剥下战斗服，就像把皮从熟透的水果上剥掉。疼归疼，没那么厉害，但是看着战斗服勾拉着她黏糊糊的伤口，这景象就比任何疼痛都让她难以接受。明日香盯着身体一点一点地露出来，然后，当她见到眼泪滴落在其中一条丑恶的、横贯她脏腑的红色疮疤上，她才意识到自己哭了。

They were healing. They had almost fully healed. But they were still tender to the touch. Her arm, her legs, her stomach, and her chest were all slick with plasma,（血浆？yep, just assume plasma in biology definition here:)） pink with LCL. Scars throbbing now that the plug suit was gone.

它们在愈合。几乎要完全愈合了，但碰上去感觉还是娇嫩的。她的手臂，她的双腿，她的肚子，她的胸口全被血浆沾得打滑，被LCL染得发红。现在战斗服已经被脱去，只留下伤口在阵阵抽搐。

She should have checked that the hot water still worked. She said a silent prayer of thanks—to Rei?—when she stuck her hand under the water and found it nearly scalding. Perfect.

她应该先检查下是不是还有热水。当她把手伸到水流下，发现还挺烫手，她自心里发出了感谢的祈祷——谢丽隆恩？

The washcloth between her lips didn’t taste like anything until she bit down hard on it, and caught a chunk of her lip in her teeth.（-浴巾咬在嘴里？防止自己疼到叫出声音所以咬在嘴里） Blood, now. But that was fine. It was just a little and it took her mind off the searing pain coursing along her flesh. She closed her eyes, sighed into the wash cloth to keep from screaming, and drained soap over her body.

衔在嘴中的毛巾直到她用力咬下去之前没有任何味道，牙齿在嘴唇上割了一口子。现在有血腥味了。但还好。只有一点点，也能让她不再去想蔓延在血肉之上的灼热痛楚。她闭上眼，把叹息声埋进毛巾里，免得张口尖叫，接着把肥皂抹遍全身。

Now, she was all pink. She wrapped herself in a towel and found Shinji returning.（-肥皂没洗掉 -是的，他没有写明日香洗掉肥皂沫！！（强迫症犯了）

现在，明日香浑身都成粉色的了。她正用浴巾裹住自己，发现真嗣回来了。

“I’m back—ah, Asuka, I’ll just leave the stuff here,” he started to say when he saw her. He turned his head, a well-timed, well-honed pivot. She glanced down at her form—most of the scars were covered by the towel, but he could see how mutilated her arm was. Even her shins and feet.

“我回来了——啊，明日香，我会把这些东西放外面，”真嗣一见她就急忙说道。他在一个恰好的时机转过脑袋，活像一个精准的转轴。她往下瞥了一眼自己的形体——绝大部分的伤疤被浴巾遮住了，但他还是能看见她的手臂有多么伤痕累累，连她的小腿和足部也不能幸免。

“No, it’s fine. Come here. I need your help.”

“Okay.” His voice trembled. Ach, Shinji, right now I need a Mensch, she thought. He began to unload the pharmacy bag.

“不，没事。过来吧。我需要你的帮助。”

“好的。”他的声音在颤抖。Ach，真嗣，现在我需要一个Mensch（-德语：好人，好家伙），她想。他开始卸下医药包。

“I, uh, got everything you asked for. And new toothbrushes, since I don’t know how long it’s been. And you didn’t even use yours for the last month, uh…”

“Shinji, I meant in the bathroom. I can’t put this stuff on myself. It hurts to stretch and twist（翻译没有问题w）. Okay?”

“Okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay.”

“我，呃，把你要的全带过来了。还有新牙刷，因为我不知道旧的放了多久。而且你上个月都没有用过，嗯……”

“真嗣，我的意思是让你过来浴室。我办不到用这东西来擦自己的身体，光是拉它扯它就疼死人了。你行不行？”

“行，行，没问题。”

She took a deep breath. It felt good to fill her lungs with steam. He joined her in the bathroom and she put her hands on the edge of the towel.

“Remember what I said. About—pretending.”

“I’ll remember.”

“Thank you.”

她深吸一口气。让蒸气充满她肺部的感觉好极了。他进了浴室，她把双手放在浴巾两侧。

“记得我说的。假装。”

“我记得。”

“谢谢。”

She slid the towel down and squeezed her eyes shut. She didn’t trust the pity not to bloom on his face. She didn’t care, now, if he saw her. He’d already seen it. But to see disappointment on his face—pity—she’d throw up again if she saw that.

“Wow, Asuka,” he whispered. She heard him gulp and she gritted her teeth.

“What? What is it?”

她将浴巾轻轻滑落，紧闭上眼睛。她不信他脸上没有丝毫的怜悯。现在她不在乎他看见她的裸体。他早就见过了。但是他脸上的失望之情——或者怜悯——如果让她看见，她又会想吐的。

“哇，明日香，”他轻声说。她听见他咽唾沫的声音，便咬紧牙关。

“什么？怎么了？”

“Sorry. It’s just—you’re really, really beautiful.” Their breathing seemed to alternate, waiting for the other to take a breath before inhaling.

Don’t push it, idiot, she wanted to say, but he wasn’t done.

“Seriously, Asuka, I’m not pretending. I’ve always thought so. This doesn’t change anything.”

“对不起。只是——你真的，真的好漂亮啊。”他们的呼吸似乎都凝滞了，等待着，看谁先吸入下一口空气。

别强迫自己，笨蛋，她想这样说，但他还没完。

“我是认真的，明日香，我没有在假装。我一直都这么想。即使现在也没有任何改变。”

She bit hard into the raw slice of her lip to keep from crying. She searched his words, his voice, but could find no trace of deception. If he was pretending, he was doing a damned good job of it.

她死死地咬住两瓣凉薄的嘴唇，免得自己哭出声。她钻研他的话语，他的声音，但怎么也找不到欺骗之意。如果他是在假装，他也该死的装得太像回事了。

“Well, fine. Lucky for you then,” she said, finally, and opened her eyes. Her eye, really. He reached for the bandage over her face.

“Why didn’t you take this one off?”

“It… it hurt too much. The tape is in my hair.”

“好，行吧，算你蒙混过关。”她说，终于，把眼睛睁开了，准确说，是单只眼。他把手伸向她脸上的绷带。

“为什么你不把这个撕掉呢？”

“因……因为疼得厉害。胶带黏住了我的头发。”

“Do you want me to try?”

“Yeah.”

“你想让我试试吗？”

“好。”

His fingers were so long. Soft, slender twigs. She flinched as he touched her, some hardwired 应激反应——代指上一句的‘flinched’ reaction that she tried to kill but couldn’t. He smiled thinly.

“Sorry—I’ll be gentle.”

“You’d better.”

他的手指好修长啊，就像温柔，细长的嫩枝。他碰到她的时候，她无可自控地畏缩了一下。他挤出细微的笑。

“对不起——我会小心的。”

“最好是这样。”

She watched his face as he worked the tape off her hair. The concentration and seriousness drawn tight over the face she was so used to seeing look—sad, tired, bored, pitiful in every possible way.

他将绷带从她的头发上揭下来时，她一直盯着他的脸。那聚精会神的表情，那一板一眼的神色，覆盖在她不能再熟悉的面庞上，各种方面来说，显得既悲哀，又疲倦，既无趣，又可怜。

“How’s it look?” she asked once he peeled the bandage down, wincing yet again as it grabbed at skin.

“Not too bad—can you open it?”

“I—don’t know.”

“看上去如何？”一旦他揭下了绷带，她即刻问道，只是绷带擦到了她的皮肤，又让她畏缩了一下。

“没那么糟糕——你能睁开它吗？”

“我——不知道。”

“Here,” he said, and wet a cloth. He wiped at it for a few seconds. “Try now.”

Her eye fluttered open, as if by magic, and there he was.

“Your eyes,” he said. “They’re really pretty.”

“稍等。”他说，把一条毛巾打湿，花了几秒钟擦了擦她的眼皮。“现在试试看。”

她的眼猛地睁开，就像魔法起效一般，他的身影映入眼帘。

“你的眼睛，”他说，“真的很漂亮。”

“I know,” Asuka murmured, and snatched the wash cloth from him. She ran it over her face and looked at it—a little blood but not much. Without a word, they both turned to the mirror: the flesh around her eye was mottled pink with burns（没有问题w）, and a deep gouge in her eyebrow shimmered wet. But her eye itself was fine.

“我知道。”明日香喃喃道，从他手里夺过了湿毛巾，在脸上一抹，定睛一看——有一点血迹，但不多。没有言语，他们不约而同地转向了镜子，只见那只眼睛周围的血肉被烧灼成斑驳的红色，眼眉有一道深深的凹陷，因湿润而闪光。但眼睛本身是完好的。

He set to work on the wounds. Occasionally, it stung. Mostly, she felt nothing. She opened her eyes to see him, crouched and bent in concentration, his face mere inches from her hips. She hated how gentle he was, or wanted to hate it—how, （how=指前文中“想要去讨厌他”的办法）if he tried, he could ensure that she felt no pain. His fingers were so delicate, so skilled, playing her wounds like the cello. Even though he wasn’t a doctor, his fingers seemed to know how to help.

他着手开始处理伤口。它会偶尔刺痛。绝大多数时候，她没什么感觉。她睁开眼看他弯着身子，全神贯注，他的脸离她的臀部只有几英寸。她恨他如此温柔，或者说，她想要去恨——但是她做不到。如果他愿意尝试，他就可以确保她感觉不到疼痛。他手指的操作是如此精细，如此娴熟，在她的伤口上挥舞着，就像正在拉一手大提琴。（-真是奇妙的比喻ww-这很真嗣ww）即使他不是一名医生，他的手似乎也懂得如何医治创痛。

He knew how to help her, how to relieve her agonies, and so often, he simply hadn’t.

他懂得如何帮助她，如何缓和她强烈的苦楚。然而多数时候，他往往只是无动于衷。 ~

The torn, ruddy flesh before him glistened with jelly now. He dabbed it on, as gently as he could, somehow containing himself. Once upon a time, being this close to Asuka, his face practically pressed into her buttocks as he treated a long, jagged scar that ran the length of her leg and crossed over the plumpness of her thighs onto her lower back, he would have shut down from embarrassment.

现在他面前，被撕裂的、泛红的伤疤闪着果冻般的光泽。他尽可能动作温柔地把药涂抹上去，不知怎的竟然把持住了自己。在处理那条自她丰满的大腿横贯到下背部的长长的、锯齿状的伤疤时，他的脸蛋几乎完全陷在她的臀部中间，要是放在以前，像这样靠近明日香的身体，他会立马羞死过去。

But this world only barely felt real. She needed this, here, in this world, and he owed it to her to help her without succumbing to a nosebleed.

但是这个世界几乎感觉不到真实。她需要他的帮助，在这里，在这个世界。他欠她实在太多，克服一点鼻血只是小意思。

Besides—even thinking about her that way made him sick with guilt. Calling her beautiful was one thing—it was the truth, as far as he was concerned, but it also seemed to be what she needed, then, at that moment. A salve for scars hidden from his eyes. （-hide from？-to aviod detection by himself）But to think about her in that way, after what had happened… No, after what he’d done.（-这里似乎没有继续说下去）

而且——即便只是对她动了一分淫念，都会叫他满心羞愧，满腹欲呕。称她美丽是一回事——从他来看，这是再真切不过的事实，而且在那个时刻，她似乎也正需要这样的赞美，这样一个，为了她的伤疤而避开视线的奴隶。不对，在他做了那件事之后，还对她有那样的心思……

“I bet,” Asuka said, cutting the silence as she eased her legs apart to let him treat a wound on her inner thigh. “You’re getting off on this. My nubile naked body. All helpless and splayed open for you.”

“我打赌，”当明日香伸展她的腿，让他处理她大腿内部的伤口时，她打破沉默道，“你已经开始想入非非了。我迷人的裸体，从头到脚，全都被你一览无余。”

He bit his lip hard to keep from crying.

他咬紧嘴唇，免得哭出声音。

“No—not really,” he said.

“不——我没那么想。”他说。

“You’re lying. You said you liked my body.”

“你在撒谎。你说过你喜欢我的身体。”

“I do. I mean, I think you’re beautiful but—I’m not thinking about you like that.”

“Because you already got to try it so you’re not interested.”

“我是说过。我的意思是，我认为你很漂亮，但是——我没有往那样的方面想你。”

“因为你已经试过了，所以才没兴趣。”

“No! No, I mean, I just feel bad. And I feel bad that I’m the only one here who can take care of you. You don’t want that, do you? I wouldn’t blame you if you never wanted to see me again.”

“不！不，我是说，我只是感觉特别糟糕。我感觉糟糕是因为，我是唯一可以在这儿照顾你的人。你肯定不希望这个人是我，对吧？如果你再也不想见我，我也不会怪你的。”

“Idiot,” she whispered after a few moments. “You’re still a man, aren’t you? You aren’t imagining how much I might be enjoying a man’s hands on me?”

“Asuka,” he said. He closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against the small （背部略微靠下的位置）of her back. “What are you doing?”（-听上去像是“你为什么要诱惑我？”的无奈发言hh -哈哈哈小情侣伤还没好透就开始了（不是）

“笨蛋，”过了一会儿，她才轻声说道，“你到底也算是个男人，不是吗？你没有想象过我多少也有可能享受来自一个男人的抚摸？”

“明日香，”他说。他闭上眼睛，把额头轻轻抵在她的细背上，“你在说什么啊。”

“我不知道。”

“I don’t know.”

He finished and taped gauze to the most egregious wounds. Asuka hobbled to her room, and while she dressed, Shinji made dinner. He could hear her muttering to herself, sifting through clothes, cursing in German, even throwing things but when she emerged, she was smiling. She wore a pale blue skirt, and a sweatshirt he’d never seen, with Latin letters emblazoned over the chest—Universität Wittenberg.

他用纱布把最严重的伤口包扎完了。明日香一跛一跛地进了房间。真嗣在她换衣服的时候着手做饭。他听见她在小声自言自语，用德语咒骂，翻寻衣服，甚至扔东西，不过当她出来时，脸上却挂着微笑。她穿着淡蓝色短裙，一条他从未见过的长袖运动衫，胸口还有醒目的拉丁字母——Universität Wittenberg。

“It was hard to find something to wear with these stupid bandages, but this is kind of cute, isn’t it?” she said, and spun around, flinging the skirt up an inch.

“有这些烦人的绷带，我都不知道穿什么才好，但这件是不是还挺可爱的？”她说着还转了个圈，甩得裙子微微上扬。

“What’s it say on your sweatshirt?” Shinji asked. A shadow passed over her face—should he have complimented the skirt?

“你这件运动衫上写的是什么意思？”真嗣问。她的脸掠过一阵不满的阴影——他不应该先夸夸这件裙子吗？

“Can’t you read it? You know some English. German’s not that different.”

He tried to sound it out, and after a few tries, she took pity on him.

“你不会读一读吗？你应该知道些英语。德语也没有那么不同。”

他试图念出声，试了好几次之后，她听不下去了。

“Universität Wittenberg—that’s where I went to university. In Germany. I never wore this sweatshirt because it always seemed like summer here, but it seems like the seasons are coming back. It was colder today than I remember it being.”

“Universität Wittenberg——这是我上的大学。在德国。我从来不穿这件运动衫，因为这里好像每天都跟夏天一样热，但现在四季似乎变得正常了。今天就比我记得以前的日子要冷很多。”

“That’s right. I wonder if something about Third Impact changed things back to how they were.” Noodles sizzled in the wok as Shinji whipped tofu and soy sauce into the pan. “I remember my mother telling me about the different seasons…”

“对。我想知道是不是第三次冲击又把这天气调回来了。”面条在锅里嘶嘶作响，真嗣把豆腐和酱油迅速倒入平底锅，“我记得我妈妈跟我讲过有关不同季节的事……”

Asuka grunted. That’s right. Mothers were probably an off-limits topic with her.（大体意思没错，调整了一下表达）

明日香咕哝一声。没错。“母亲”于她而言很有可能是个禁忌的话题。

“I always forget that you graduated university,” Shinji continued. He glanced over his shoulder to see her sitting down, watching him from the dining room table. His shoulders tensed for a second, remembering that horrible dream, but her head wasn’t bowed—she looked at him, and she didn’t seem mad. “There’s really a lot I don’t know about you, Asuka.”

“我总是忘记你已经大学毕业了。”真嗣继续说。他回头看到她坐下来，在餐厅桌的另一端朝他对望。他的肩膀绷紧了一秒，记起了那个可怕的梦，但此时她并没有垂着头——她正看着他，似乎也没有生气。“明日香，我真的还有很多不了解你的地方。”

“Maybe I’d like to keep it that way, Third Child.”

His shoulders slumped.

“I guess I don’t blame you.”

“也许我就没想让你了解，第三适格者。”

他的肩膀耷拉下来。

“我猜我不会怪你。”

He divided the noodles between two bowls. The produce in the fridge had gone bad, and he started to apologize that there wouldn’t be any fresh vegetables but the look on Asuka’s face told him she wouldn’t want to hear it.

他把面条分到了两个碗里。冰箱里的食材已经变质了，他欲张口为没有任何新鲜蔬菜而道歉，但明日香脸上的表情警告他，她并不想听到这个词。

“Let’s eat,” he said softly. She said nothing, merely dipping into （这个词主要体现的是她只从碗里夹起一点点）the noodles and piloting them to her mouth.

“I hope it’s okay,” he tried again.

“那就开动吧。”他轻声说。她没说话，只是撩起一小筷子面条然后送进嘴里。

“我希望味道还行。”他又试着说。

Finally, he couldn’t resist any longer—

“I’m sorry we don’t have any fresh vegetables—“

最后，他再也憋不住了——

“对不起，我们没有新鲜的蔬菜了—”

“How could that possibly be your fault?” Her voice grabbed him by the throat and he sputtered.

“I just mean…”

“那怎么可能是你的错？”像被掐住了脖子，她的声音让他窒息。他结巴地说道：“我只是想说……”

“Pathetic.”

He bowed his head.

“Just be nice to me.”

“I am nice to you.”

“真可怜。”

他垂下头。

“对我温柔一点吧。”

“我已经对你很温柔了。”

That was from—when they were in that place.他想对照的应该是eoe里两人正面冲突的镜头 He looked up at her to see her mouth dropping open. The look of hatred he’d expected was absent—she was… startled. Eyes wide. Lip trembling. She dropped her chop sticks into the bowl and he let loose a little yelp when she reached for his hand. If that had surprised him, the way his fingers responded to the warmth without question, intertwining them with hers, caught him even more off-guard.

这正是——基于先前在这里所发生的事。他抬起头，看见她的嘴巴大张。她脸上的表情不复从前，没有他预料的那般仇恨，而是……惊奇。双目圆睁。双唇轻颤。她把筷子扔进碗里，他惊叫一声，因为她握住了他的手。仅仅是这样已经够让他意想不到了，更让他意想不到的是，他的手指竟然毫不犹豫地回应了这份温暖，与她的手指相互交缠。

“We’re really the last two people on Earth who should be the last two people on Earth,” he said.

“我们，是最不该活在世界上的两个人，却恰恰同时活在了这个世界上。”他说。

They finished in silence. Asuka wouldn’t let go of his hand. Finally, he eased his fingers away to clean up but she caught him again.

他们安静地结束了话题。明日香不愿放开他的手。终于，他的手松开退去，但她又抓住了他。

“Hey,” she said. She wasn’t smiling, but there was something in her eyes like a grin. “Let’s go get drunk and kill this thing inside of me.”（-这句话有什么惯用翻译吗？我想这句话想得脑子快凸了 -我理解的thing是指“世界上只剩下两人”，然后明日香想借喝醉来遗忘这个事实）

“嘿，”她说。她没有笑，但她的眼睛似乎在笑。“咱们出门去，喝到不醉不归，把这些烂事彻底忘个一干二净。”

~

There was a basement bar a block from their building. They had both walked by it far too many times to count—the kind of sleazy place bored-looking women in short dresses always seemed to be waiting outside of. Misato mentioned once that she’d gotten kicked out of, and Shinji even remembered Ritsuko teasing her about it. In other words, it was the perfect place to drink yourself stupid post-apocalypse.

离他们的家一个街区的地方，有个地下酒吧。他们从前不知经过了多少次——那个身穿短裙，神情慵懒的女人总是会在这个不怎么正经的地方外头等客。美里提到过她曾有一次大醉酩酊，被赶了出来，真嗣甚至记得律子还拿这件事取笑了她。换句话说，想要把自己灌醉，以忘记愚蠢的世界末日，此地为最佳去处。

The door was unlocked. Most doors were, it seemed. They exchanged knowing looks.

门没锁。街上大部分的门似乎都这样。他们交换了个眼神。

“It must have been open when Third Impact happened,” Asuka wondered aloud as Shinji eased the door open. A thick cloud of dust gasped about them as they stepped inside. Briefly, she wondered if this was a terrible, horrible mistake: the bar was littered with damp clothes, the remnants of the last patrons. Half-evaporated drinks stood bearing lonely witness to the end of the world. The entire place smelled vaguely of fruit juice and syrup.

“在第三次冲击发生的时候，这里肯定还在营业。”明日香思忖着，真嗣慢慢地推开了门。他们一踏入里面，就被一团厚厚的灰尘呛住了。有那么一瞬间，她想着他们是不是犯了个糟糕透顶、荒谬绝伦的错误：这酒吧里，潮湿的衣物摊得到处都是，客人们的私人物品散落一地。只剩下酒杯子孤零零地竖着，装的液体被蒸发了大半，也算是见证了世界末日。整个地方弥漫着果汁和糖浆的气味。

Shinji glanced back at her and whatever the face she had been making, she replaced it with a resolute frown.

“What are you waiting for, idiot? I said I wanted you to make me a cocktail and Misato only had cheap beer!”（-这边的句子前后关系是？-为了强调她要的是鸡尾酒，你翻得没问题哈哈哈哈）

真嗣回瞥了明日香一眼，不管刚才她的脸上有什么怪表情，现在她都打算坚定地皱起眉头加以掩饰。

“你还在等什么，笨蛋？我说想让你给我弄杯鸡尾酒，不是尽喝那些美里的廉价啤酒！”

“You don’t think it’s—creepy?”

“Everything’s creepy. There’s no where we can go that won’t be like this. Did you think I just wanted to sit at home with you all night?”

“你不觉得——这个地方很可怕吗？”

“哪儿都一样可怕。我们能去的地方，没有一家不长这样。你觉得我会想要一整晚都和你在家里傻坐着吗？”

Somehow, even as she said it, the way she phrased that made her blush. Home. Why did that word taste so odd?

不知怎的，即便她能说出这个词，但表达的方式还是让她感到害羞——家，为什么这个字眼听上去这么奇特呢？

Shinji stepped behind the bar. He brushed the dust away from a few bottles and coughed.

真嗣绕到吧台后面。他拂去几个瓶子上面的灰尘，咳嗽了一声。

“Um, I don’t really know anything about cocktails, Asuka.”

“Fine. Then, I’d like to start with a good German beer.”

“呃，我真的对调酒一窍不通，明日香。”

“行吧。那...先给我来杯上好的德国啤酒。”

“Um,” he said, squatting down and digging into a fridge. “There’s… Heineken.”

“Dummkopf! That’s not German. It’s Dutch.”

“What’s the difference?”

“呃，”他蹲下，一头钻到冰箱里，“这里有……Heineken。”

“Dummkopf!（德语：笨蛋）不是德国产的。那是荷兰语。”

“有什么区别吗？”

She rose on her heels, over the bar, only to see him grinning at her. She snatched the green bottle out of his hand, and then gave it back when she realized she had no opener. He poured two bottles and they raised their glasses.

她踮着脚跟，趴到吧台上，只见他对她咧嘴笑。她从他手里抓过绿色的瓶子，发现自己没开瓶器，又给还回去了。他倒了两杯出来，然后共同举杯。

“In German, you say ‘Prost!’ for cheers,” she instructed. “Eins, zwei, drei…”

“在德国，你要干杯的时候会说‘Prost’！”她示意道，“Eins,zwei,drei……”（德语：一、二、三……）

Asuka had only had beer a few times, but she wasn’t about to let Shinji know that. The flavor—crisp, malty, but too bitter—almost made her gag, but she forced a gulp down, and then another, and by the time her glass was halfway drunk, she’d started to enjoy the taste.

明日香只喝过几次酒，但她不打算让真嗣知道。这酒味——清新的，混着麦芽香，但是太苦了——差点让她噎住，但她硬是咽了下去，然后又猛吞了第二口，到她的杯子被喝了一半时，她已经开始享受这味道了。

“You’re—drinking that fast.”

“I guess Misato rubbed off on me（-be adopted by Misato, then Asuka has her mannerisms/ characteristics).”

“你喝得太快了啦。”

“我猜是受了美里的影响。”

“You’ll make yourself sick if you drink too fast,” he tried one last time. A withering look was her only reply. “But that’s what you’re trying to do.”

“要是喝得这么快，你会想吐的。”他最后试着劝了一次。她只是剜了他一眼。“不过你本来就打算这么干。”

“Obviously. And you’re getting sick with me.” She tipped the rest of the beer back（把剩下的酒几口就喝掉的意思ww *tip back专门用来形容豪饮，特别是酒精一类）, with a few steady gulps and let out a mighty belch. She hadn’t been expecting that, but she found she rather liked the stunned expression on Shinji’s face. “Next. Surprise me.”

“当然。而且你也得陪我一起醉。”她把剩下的半瓶酒也倒进嘴里，稳稳地咽了几口，打了个响亮的嗝。她没料到自己会这样，但是能看见真嗣脸上震惊的表情，她觉得也还不赖。“下一杯。给我来点惊喜。”

A dust bound book caught Shinji’s eye. He palmed it open, squinted in the dim light, and found the table of contents. The first recipe was complicated, but it seemed impressive and sophisticated—something she’d like. A quick perusal of the bottles behind the bar revealed that he had all the ingredients at hand.

一本尘封的书吸引了真嗣的注意力。他用手掌翻开，在昏暗的灯光下眯起眼睛，找到了目录。第一个配方就很复杂，但似乎精致，高端，上档次——是她会喜欢的。他很快地扫过吧台后面的瓶瓶罐罐，发现他要的所有原料都齐全。

“Okay—give me a moment,” he said, taking another gulp of his beer. Asuka watched him work. He brought care to what he did, treating it like piloting an Eva or playing the cello or making her dinner. Three things, she reminded herself, that he did exceedingly well. Would this be a fourth?

“好吧——给我一点时间。”他说着，又喝了一口他的啤酒。明日香看着他开始干活。他干这活就跟开Eva，拉大提琴，给她做晚饭一样投入。这三件事，她提醒自己，他都做得很漂亮。还会有第四件吗？

No. Thinking like that was dangerous.

Why, she asked herself, was it dangerous?

不。往那个方面去想是很危险的。

为什么，她心想，为什么危险？

Because it would be so easy to end up hating one another. You should really hate him, for what he did to you. And if he doesn’t hate you now—he will before long—because everyone, Asuka, everyone ends up hating you. Why would he stay in this world, heavy with guilt, with you? He could plop back into that lake of souls and merge with Wondergirl and never feel anything and you’d be all alo—

因为很容易会落得憎恨对方的下场。你真应该恨他，为他对你做的这些事。如果他现在不恨你——他很快也会的——因为每个人，明日香，每个人到最后都会恨你。为什么他宁可背负着愧疚，和你一同待在这个世界？他大可以一头栽回到那个灵魂的湖里去，和优等生融为一体，和负罪感说再见，而你呢，从此孑然一身——

“Okay, Asuka,” Shinji chirped. “Try it.”

“好了，明日香，”真嗣轻语道，“试试看。”

A glowing purple drink stood before her. She eyed it like the secretion of some ancient beast, resurrected for treachery.（-感觉遭到了背叛？ -拿来形容这个ancient beast的hhhh）

“What am I looking at?”

在她面前立着一杯发光的紫色液体。她盯着它，就像这是某种因受到背叛而苏醒的某种古代野兽的分泌物。

“我看到的是什么？”

“It’s called an Abi—Avi—Aviash—“

“Aviation?”

“That’s it. My English is rusty.”

“这叫Abi-Avi-Aviash——”

“Aviation?”

“是的。我英语很烂。”

“You didn’t poison me, did you?” She raised the drink to her lips. There was something witchy and beautiful about the amethyst pond, which seemed to move in its glass as one, leaving no traces of itself behind.（-what’s this thing？-我试着翻了这一整句，可以看看有没有make sense）

“你该不会是想毒死我吧？”她把杯子举到唇边。这潭美丽的紫晶色液体看起来像是某种巫术的残留，在杯中浑然一体，不留下任何拖曳的痕迹。

“N-no! I know it looks weird, but it says here the ingredients are usual. ‘Crème de violette’ and gin…”

“Gin,” she said, swirling it once last time. “Like a martini.”

“怎-怎么会！我知道它看上去很怪异，但这上面写着的原料都很常见。‘Crème de violette’ and gin…”（-一种花香型的甜酒，以紫罗兰为原料）

“Gin（-杜松子酒？），”她说，最后把酒杯晃了一次，“类似马提尼酒。”

“I guess. I don’t really know much about alcohol. I’ve had sake （sake=清酒）at funerals and I swiped a beer from Misato once or twice but that’s it. Until tonight.”

“大概吧。我真的对酒没多少了解。只是在以前参加过的葬礼上喝过清酒，然后偷喝过一两次美里小姐的啤酒，再就是今晚。

As she spoke, she took a sip. How could something taste so smooth—so bitter and sweet at once? She let it play on her tongue for a second before swallowing.

“You stole beer from Misato?” she choked. “Why didn’t you tell me? That would have made living with her way more fun.”

他说的时候，她啜了一小口。怎么能有一样东西尝起来既滑溜——又苦，还甜？她在舌头上逗留了一秒钟，才咽下去。

“你从美里那里偷啤酒？”明日香呛了一下，“为什么你不告诉我？告诉我的话，还能让我们和她同居的生活多点乐子呢。”

“Well, it was only a few times and I didn’t really like it that much. And I didn’t think you’d want to do that.” He scratched his head like a little boy admitting to some minor wrongdoing—which, now that she thought about it （现在她确实在考虑做些这样的事了！）, was exactly what he was. “Hang out with me, like that. And drink.”

“嗯，只有几次啦，而且我不怎么喜欢。另外我不知道你也想要那么做。”他搔着脑袋瓜，就像个小男孩承认一些常识性的错误——而她现在恰恰开始考虑做些这种事了。“约我出去玩，像这样，然后喝酒。”

“We hung out all the time at home,” she said and took another sip. And another. “We watched TV and played video games and read…”

“我们就整天在家里玩。”她说着又啜了一口，再一口。“我们看电视，打游戏（口语化一点），看书……”

“But we didn’t really do any of that stuff together. We read manga and stuff, but side by side and we didn’t really talk. Or we argued over what we’d watch and you always won. Or I watched you play video games. When I did things with Touji and Kensuke… We, you know, talked about them and did them together. Camping and stuff.” Something on her face must have scared him because he added, almost immediately: “Sorry.”

“但我们真没有一起做过什么事。我们看漫画，或别的书，但都是自顾自的，没什么交流。或者就是为自己想看的节目而争吵不休，你每次都是赢家。或者就是我看着你打游戏。当我和东治和剑介一起……我们，你知道的，我们会商讨计划，合作完成。野营之类的。” 她脸上的表情一定把他吓着了，因为他几乎，条件反射地加了一句：“对不起。”

“Idiot,” she scowled. “You could have… said something. I didn’t exactly have a normal childhood. If I was weird—it was probably because I wasn’t used to spending a lot of time with someone.”

“笨蛋，”她绷着脸说，“你本来可以……说点什么。我的童年和正常人不太一样。如果我表现得很奇怪——可能是因为我不习惯花很多时间和别人待在一起。”

“It’s okay. Really. I didn’t mind.”

“No, you brought it up, so you clearly did mind!” she said, voice rising. “If you had just told me, maybe I could have fixed and maybe we could have—“ Something caught in her voice. She frowned, forcing the tremble in her lip to cease, and pressed the rim of the cocktail glass to her mouth. Cool ethanol oblivion （以几乎无法感受到液体存在的速度喝下去了）washed over her tongue.

“没关系。真的。我不介意。”

“不，你都明着提出来了，所以你肯定很在意！”她提高了音量，“如果你跟我提了，也许我就可以搞定这个问题，也许我们就可以……”有什么卡住了她的声音。她皱起眉，强行止住了嘴唇的颤抖，用鸡尾酒的玻璃杯边缘压住嘴巴。冰凉的酒精几乎毫无感触地洗润了她的舌头。

He took another sip of his beer, and then a gulp. He burped behind his hand and opened another bottle.

“It would have been nice, right?” he ventured. “If we had been friends.”

他也啜了一口自己的啤酒，然后咽下。他用手掩着打了个嗝，打开了另一瓶。

“本来可以顺顺利利的，对吧？”他壮起胆子说，“如果我们是朋友的话。”

“God knows Wondergirl wasn’t great company. Hikari was great, and your idiot friends were okay, but it’s not like they understood.”

“Ayanami had it rough,” he countered. “I don’t think she knew what to make of things until the very end. They really kept her in the dark about everything they were doing.”

“老天知道优等生是个差劲的同伴。小光呢挺好，你的笨蛋朋友们也不赖，但他们都不理解我们。”

“绫波只知道个大概，”他插话道，“我觉得直到最后她才知道明白怎么做。他们的计划全都在暗中进行，把她瞒得死死的。”

“But she didn’t have to be so—so—smug. Even now, I feel like she’s smirking at me. Like she knows something I don’t.”

“但她也不用这么——这么——自鸣得意吧。即使现在，我还是感觉她在朝我坏笑。就像她还知道什么秘密。”

“She probably does. Not that it matters.”

Asuka finished her drink, and Shinji made her another. Drunkenness was descending, and it felt wonderful—a warm coat that made her impervious to anything and everything she might say. He might say. Anything.

“也许她是知道。不过那不重要。”

明日香喝光了她的酒，真嗣又给她倒了一杯。酒醉的晕眩感正在退去，现在她感觉特别好——像一件温暖的外套，让她能肆意地倾吐任何事，并且不在乎他想说的。任何话。

“We could have been friends,” she repeated, nodding. He nodded too.

“We should have been friends.”

“I would have liked that.”

“我们本来可以做朋友的。”她不住地点头重复。他也颔首同意。

“我们肯定能成为朋友。”

“我也许会很喜欢和你做朋友。”

“Really?”

“Obviously, idiot! You must be really brain dead. I was—“ And here, she pulled the cloak of alcohol tight around her vulnerable flesh. “—flirting with you all the time. I thought you weren’t interested.” She let the words settle on his stunned face. “I thought you liked Wondergirl more.”

“真的？”

“当然啦，笨蛋！你的脑袋肯定是木头做的。我——”到这儿，她把酒精的外衣紧紧裹住自己脆弱的内心，“——无时无刻不在和你调情。我以为你只是对我不感兴趣。”她让这句话沉落到他愕然的脸上。“我以为你更喜欢优等生。”

“No way.”

“For real.”

“You’re making this up. What about—what about—the ‘impenetrable wall of Jericho’ and all that stuff?”

“不可能。”

“是真的。”

“你在乱编。关于——关于——‘无法逾越的耶利哥之墙’，还有别的那些，你怎么说？”

“Shinji,” she said, setting her glass down. “Do you know what’s so special about the wall of Jericho?”

“真嗣啊，”她说，把她的杯子放下，“你知道耶利哥之墙为什么这么特别吗？”

“Um—it’s really strong and—impenetrable?”

“So they thought. But, in scripture, God helps the Israelites…“—and here she made sure to emphasize each syllable—“…PEN-E-TRATE it. It falls. That’s what people know about it.”

“嗯——因为它非常坚硬——坚不可摧？”

“所以那些造墙的人也这么想。但是，根据经文，上帝帮助以色列人……”这里她为了强调，特地加重了每个音节——“……攻 破 了 它。它倒了。这才是人们会记住它的原因。”

Shinji hung his head. Asuka couldn’t help but giggle.

“And thermal expansion? Do you think I really cared about your grades? Do you think if I did, I’d be explaining things to you with my tits? Or what I’d ‘accidentally’ fall into bed with you?”

真嗣丧气地低下头。明日香忍不住发笑。

“还有热膨胀，你以为我真会关心你的学习成绩吗？如果我真的关心，你觉得我会一边晃着奶子一边跟你解释吗？还有，我真是‘一不小心’才睡到你床上的吗？”

“I thought that was just—how you were.”

“And I thought you were a normal, healthy teenage boy and you’d try something.” She sighed. “I guess you did. Just not when I needed it.”

“我以为那只是——你的行事作风。”

“我以为你是个正常的、健康的青春期男孩，我以为你总会尝试做点什么。”她叹息，“我猜你做了。只是没在我需要的时间。”

“I’m sorry. I—I—I can’t believe how badly I screwed up, Asuka.”

“I don’t want to hear it. It just sucks.（我很喜欢你这个翻法哈哈哈哈）”

“I know.”

“对不起。我——我——我没法相信我居然把事情搞砸成这样，明日香。”

“我不想听见这个词。顶不上一个屁用。”

“我知道。”

“We could have been something.” There was something wet in his eyes that she focused on, even though she wanted to look away.

“I would have liked that, Asuka. I was—so lonely and confused. I just thought you couldn’t possibly be interested in me.”

“我们本来可以创造更美好的关系。”他的眼睛有什么湿润了，尽管很想挪开目光，她依然定睛凝视。

“我情愿那样，明日香。我是——那么孤单和困惑。我只是以为你不可能对我感兴趣。”

“That’s your problem,” she said, thrusting her drink at his face. “You can’t even imagine being loved by someone else, so you don’t even consider that someone else might need your love!” As soon as she said it, she wanted to take it back. If she could have, she would have gathered up the words that had come tumbling out of her lips and force them back down her gullet but words spoken can’t be unheard. （-太绕了！-草，我大声朗读了三遍才想明白该怎么翻，you got it!!）This was another entropy （这里我想了很久，虽然熵值这个词没有错，但是总觉得有点生硬...? 用英文解释entropy的话是‘lack of order or predictability; gradual into discounter’）you couldn’t reverse.

“那是你的问题。”她说着把杯子往他脸上一戳，“你甚至不能想象被人爱的感觉，所以你也想不到竟然有人需要你的爱！”她话一出口，就想收回去。如果她能收回这未经推敲打磨就脱口而出的话语，也就能把这些全都随着酒精咽下肚去，可惜某人带着耳朵。这也是另一个事件无可避免地走向失败与混乱的例子。

Shinji seemed, suddenly, very interested in the bubbles dancing in his beer. She was about to yell at him, probably forbid him from pitying her, when he interrupted the panicked thoughts forming themselves into words in her mind.

“We could have been in love.”

真嗣似乎，突然对他啤酒里跃动的泡泡发生了兴趣。她欲冲他大喊，可能想让他别再同情她了，就在那时，他打断了她脑海里纷乱仓皇的思绪和涌到嘴边的话语。

“我们本来可以相爱。”

Whatever he could have said at that moment—nothing could have cut like that. （翻对了！！yey!!）

“Yeah. We could have.”

“That sucks.”

世界上再也没有第二种方式，像他现在说出这句话那样，让她的想法骤然改变。

“是啊。我们本来可以的。”

“真要命。”

“We could have been there for each other.”

“Throughout the entire stupid Third Impact. Nerv. Human Instrumentality. Everything my dad was doing. It would have been so different if I’d had someone to—to—rely on.”

“我们本来可以守护对方的。”

“整个愚蠢的第三次冲击。还有Nerv，还有人类补完计划。我爸策划的一切。期间要是有个人可以让我——依靠的话，事情就大不一样了。”

“Mein Gott, Shinji, think about it,” she said, leaning forward, smiling. “If we’d been in love. We would have been unstoppable.”

“Mein Gott（德语：老天啊）,真嗣，想想看，”她说，往前倾身，露出一抹微笑，“如果那时我们彼此相爱的话，就能所向披靡了。”

“You think so?”

“你真这么想？”

“Oh, obviously! The one time my Synch rate was perfect was when I, uh, realized that my mother was with me, you know. I think the big flaw in the EVA project was who they found to pilot them. They really found the most screwed up kids possible, didn’t they? If we’d been in a loving, supportive relationship the whole time…” She mimed a rocket taking off with her drink in tow. “Synch rates through the roof. We’d have kicked every Angel’s ass, no questions asked. You’d have saved my ass when SEELE came after NERV. And then, we would have crushed NERV, SEELE, and the UN.”

“The UN too?”

“嚄，当然咯！我唯一一次同步率达到满分，是我，嗯，发现母亲一直都在我身边，你知道是什么意思。我觉得EVA计划里最致命的弱点就是他们找的驾驶员。他们总是尽可能找那些精神最有缺陷的小孩，不是吗？如果我们俩自始至终处在一种互相扶持的恋爱关系，”她猛地提起杯子，模拟火箭一飞冲天，“同步率就能时时爆表。我们能把每个使徒揍得落花流水，压根没有悬念。当SEELE到NERV本部砸场子时，你可以耍个英雄救美。然后，我们就能齐心协力把NERV,SEELE和整个联合国一窝端了。”

“联合国也？”

“Definitely. Definitely the UN too. Because then we’d take over the world. Think about it, Shinji. The EVAs are practically gods. We would have been invincible. We could have averted all of this and made sure peace and prosperity reigned forever and ever.” Understanding flashed on his face and he gave her the saddest smile she’d ever seen anyone make.

“那是当然。怎么能放过联合国。只要搞垮它我们就能接管世界了。想一想，真嗣。EVA本来都是神一般的存在。我们本来可以所向无敌。我们本来可以避免这一切的失控，确保世界和平，经济繁荣，直到永永远远。”他的脸闪过了理解的神色，他冲她露出了她从来没有在他人脸上见过的悲伤表情。

“When you put it that way—I almost believe we could have done it.”

“You bet your ass（=absolutely certain that something will happen） we could have. We would have been unstoppable.”

“We could have been in love,” he repeated.

“你这样夸夸其谈的时候——我都差点相信我们真的可以办到了。”

“你应该说：‘我可以肯定我们能办到’。我们本来可以所向披靡！”

“我们本来可以在爱里徜徉。”他跟着说。

“But, now,” she said and finished her drink. She knocked her knuckles against the bar. “We never will be. Next.”

“但是，现在，”她说着把酒一饮而尽，用手指关节敲了敲吧台。“我们永远不可能了。下一杯。”

The night deteriorated rapidly after that.

很快，夜幕沉沉地坠了下来。

“Here, look,” she said, dabbing a drop of maraschino syrup onto her cheek and tucking the bottom two thirds of her hair into her sweatshirt. “Who am I?”

Shinji’s eyes wavered for a second.

“Dr. Akagi!”

“快看，”她蘸了一滴马拉斯加樱桃酒到脸颊上，把下沿以上三分之二的头发塞进她的运动衫里，“猜猜我是谁？”

真嗣眼珠子一转。

“赤木博士！”

“And now who am I?” She mussed up her hair, pushing some of it forward over her face, and drew her lips thin and straight. She stared at Shinji, unblinking.

“Ayanami?”

“Right! You do one.”

“那现在我又是谁呢？”她弄乱头发，把其中一些捋到前额上方，嘴唇抿得细而直。她盯着真嗣，眼睛一眨不眨。

“绫波？”

“对了！你来整一个。”

As if in a daze, he searched the bar. A huddled mound of clothing a few seats down from them provided his inspiration: he plucked the pair of glasses, still slick with LCL, from the remnants of their own, and donned them. He leaned his elbows forward on the bar, joined his hands, and let his face rest against them.

Asuka let out a gasp.

晕晕乎乎的，他扫视着吧台。几张座椅外，一堆形若土墩的衣物给了他灵感：他从那些人的遗物中间翻找出一副仍然滴着LCL汁水的眼镜，然后带上它。他的胳膊肘向前抵住台面，手指交叉，把脸倚在中间。

明日香倒吸一口气。

“Commander Ikari. You look just like him when you do that.”

“I mean,” Shinji said, discarding the glasses. “I am his son. Was his son. I don’t know what I am.”（-怎么翻？）

Asuka’s glass was empty and she knocked against the bar once more. Shinji scratched through the bar book.（-刮穿了？应该是指动作胡乱随意？）

“How about a Boulevardier?”

“是碇司令。你简直和他是从一个模子里刻出来的。”

“我想说，”真嗣说着丢掉眼镜，“我是他的儿子，从前是。现在就不知道了。”

明日香的酒杯子已经空了，她又敲了敲吧台。真嗣随意地扫了一眼酒吧菜单。“Boulevardier如何？”

Their bodies blazed in spite of themselves on the long stagger home. Asuka stripped her sweatshirt off, wrapped it around her waist, and leaned against his arm.

“I feel gross,” she grumbled for the second time that day. “This stupid thing inside of me had better die.”

Shinji slurred something and she scowled. Leave it to him to disappear into drunkenness when she needed him. At least he was reasonably steady.（-她需要他的时候，他也醉得头脑发昏。至少他走路还算稳定。——这个意思？）

回家的路漫漫，他们浑身发烫，不胜酒力，走得磕磕绊绊。明日香把运动衫扯下来，裹在她的腰间，靠在他的手臂上。

“真恶心。”她是同一天里第二次抱怨这句话，“但愿心里的倒霉事早点烟消云散才好。”

真嗣含糊不清地说了什么，她绷紧了脸。

“Asuka, look,” he said suddenly, clear as day. She froze and turned with him. They stood before two benches, a bannister, and then a drop-off. There, months ago, had been city, and here, they had once stood. The night she ran out on the impromptu party where Touji, Kensuke, and Hikari had watched Rei beat her in that stupid choreographed dance. Shinji had come to find her, had stayed with her. Laughed and traded jokes, timid though he was, with her. Agreed to work hard with her. She had mounted one of these benches, declared her intention to win for all the world to hear—though, in fact, it had just been Shinji. “Remember this place?”（-结合这里的描述，感觉那个场景又甜了一倍）

“明日香，快看，”他的声音忽然朗朗如白昼。她身子一僵，和他一样转头。他们站在两条长凳，一面扶栏，和一道陡坡前面。数月前，城市依旧，他们曾在此处逗留。那天傍晚，东治，剑介和小光在他们家开即兴派对，他们目睹了丽在那次愚蠢的编排好的舞蹈练习中打败了她，所以她一气之下离家而去。真嗣找到她，一直陪着她。即使腼腆如真嗣，也会和她打趣说笑，并答应会跟她一起努力。她爬到其中一条长椅上，向世界人民宣告了她要赢的决心——虽然，其实，在场的只有真嗣而已。

“你记得这个地方吗？”

“Of course I remember this spot,” she scowled. “I might be drunk but I still—I still—“

Something inside of her changed. She dashed to the railing, jerked her head over it, and vomited. Shinji was quick to grab her hair, bundling it into a fist. He regarded her for a second with dull eyes before her, too, threw his head over the railing.（-?）

“我当然记得了，”她气鼓鼓地说，“我可能喝醉了，但我还是能——还是能——”

在她体内，有什么东西搅动起来。她冲到栏杆边，把头猛地伸出去，开始呕吐。真嗣赶紧抓住她的头发，攥得紧紧的。前一秒他还呆呆地凝视着她，后一秒，她 也猛地把头伸到栏杆外面，吐了起来。

Somewhere in between volleys of stomach acid, he began to laugh.

“What’s so funny?” she demanded through tears, her throat hoarse.

“Asuka, we’re so stupid. Why did we get drunk? We could just get medication for you from the pharmacy.”

才吐了半肚子的酸水，他就笑了。

“有什么好笑的？”她质问道，尽管她眼泪花花，喉咙沙哑。

“明日香，我们真傻。我们为什么非得醉成这样呢？明明可以去药店里给你找点药的。”

“Idiot, you don’t think I knew that?” she screamed. Her head went back over the railing and soon, she was laughing too. “Mein Gott, we are so stupid, aren’t we?”

“笨蛋，你以为我不知道吗？”她喊道。把头搁回到栏杆上面，她也开始跟着笑起来。“Mein Gott,我们真的傻到家了。”

“We’re idiots.”

“We’re the dumbest. I could’ve taken a pill and we could be relaxing at home right now.”

“We’re so dumb.” Shinji’s throat made a sound somewhere between that of a dying car and a dying elephant. “Why did we get so drunk?”

“It was my idea. I’m an idiot.”

“我们都是笨蛋。”

“我们是笨蛋中的极品。本来只要吞个药片下去，就可以安安心心回家睡大觉了。”

“我们真的好蠢啊。”真嗣的嗓音好像一台快废掉的老爷车，或是一头快死掉的大象。“为什么要喝得这么醉呢？”

“我出的主意，所以我是笨蛋头子。”

“It’s okay. I’m the idiot who followed you.”

This was admittedly terrible but, Asuka realized, it was not the worst she’d ever felt.

“Hey, Shinji, you know what’s worse than this?”

“What?”

“没关系。我是你的笨蛋属下。”（-稍微意译咯）

确实太烂了，但是呢，明日香意识到，她已经经历过比这糟糕百倍千倍的事了。

“嘿，真嗣，你知道有什么比这更糟糕的吗？”

“什么？”

“Getting raped by your friend after having a mental breakdown, and then getting dismembered by giant robot monsters because your friend was too much of a coward to come and save you!”

Shinji wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and looked at her. She forced herself to look at him, even as she felt something suspicious dribbling down her chin.

“You—“ he started, swallowed, and continued: “Think I’m your friend?”

“你在精神崩溃的时候，被你的朋友给侵犯了；之后，你还被一群机器怪兽分尸，只因为那个朋友是胆小鬼，甚至提不起勇气来救你！”

真嗣用手背捂住嘴，怔怔地看着明日香。她强迫自己和他对视，即使她感觉有什么可疑的东西顺着下巴往下滴。（-这是指说漏了嘴，还是单纯的呕吐物？）

“你——”他张口，吞了口唾沫，又继续道：“你把我当你的朋友了？”

Her mouth dropped open another inch as they stared at each other. Then, like a storm breaking a heatwave, laughter overtook them. In unison, they dove their heads over the railing once more and hurled.

她的嘴巴又张大了一点，两人你看我，我看你。然后，就像一场暴风雨扫荡了热浪，笑声主宰了他们的世界。像是互相约好似的，两人再一次把头伸到栏杆外，把剩下的苦闷感吐了个干净。（-修改的时候，对应上面“暴风雨扫荡了热浪”，又意译了一下x） ~

It seemed like the least he could do and yet, it felt like one of the hardest things he’d ever done.

这似乎是他所有做过的事中最容易的，却又是最难的一件。

The next morning, Shinji awoke from troubled dreams to find Asuka drooling spit and vomit （-口水和呕吐物？）on his chest, a leg thrown over his body and her arms wrapped tight around his midsection. Her arms pinned his left arm, while her shoulders and head pinned his other beneath her. In other words, he was holding her and anyone coming upon them, with no prior knowledge of their relationship, would have seen two young lovers, sloppy and alive with infinite futures animated before them.

第二天早晨，真嗣从纷纷扰扰的梦境里醒来，看见明日香吐在他胸口上的残渣。她还在淌口水，一条腿甩在他身上，双手紧紧圈住他的肚腩。她的两条胳膊抵在他的左手臂上，她的肩膀和脑袋又抵在他另一侧。言下之意是，他抱住了她。任何人撞着他们，如果对两人的关系一无所知，准会以为是一对年轻的恋人，庸雅而恣意，在他们面前尚有无限生气的未来。

But, that’s not what Shinji felt. He had the vague notion that his mouth had been replaced by one of the ash trays at NERV HQ, and he was convinced that someone had bludgeoned him half to death in the middle of the night. It was only when he extracted （使分心）himself from Asuka’s embrace and examined his skull, finding no wound, that he realized it was just the worst headache he’d ever experienced.

但是，那可不是真嗣当时的感受。他有个模糊的概念，好像自己的嘴被调换成了NERV总部的其中一盘烟灰缸，并且十分确信半夜里有人一棒子把他打得不省人事。只有当他从明日香的怀抱里分出心思，检查自己的头盖骨发现并没有钝伤时，他才意识到这其实是他所经历过的最剧烈的头疼。

There was something comforting, he realized, in this. Somehow, the world held cruel possibilities that the EVAs and the Angels had not yet introduced him to. Life went on after Instrumentality, and it got worse, but—did he dare think it? Maybe that meant it could get better too.

不过还是有舒服的地方，他想。不知怎的，那个充斥着EVA和使徒们的世界好像还没打算拉他回去。在人类补完以后，生活更为艰辛，但是——容他如此作想：那也意味着日子能过得更加轻松。

He struggled to his feet. He washed his face and drank water until his stomach seemed to swell. Using his hand to keep the world from spinning, he guided himself to the door and then to the elevator—it was some small brilliant piece of providence that those elevators still worked.

他挣扎着起床，去洗了把脸，水喝到肚子发胀。他用双手保持住平衡，免得世界天旋地转，慢慢地挪到门口，然后是电梯间——真是不幸中的万幸，电梯仍然还能照常运转。

Once outside, fending off cruel sunlight’s thesis, he beat a path to the pharmacy. Heaving himself over the counter in the back, （-这是翻到柜台后面？）he shifted the instrumentalized pharmacist’s clothes out of the way once more and selected the correct combination of pills for Asuka. Everything was clearly labeled. This really was so much simpler and cleaner than anything else they could have done.

到了外边，他踏上去药店的路。他又一次把药剂师们的衣物推到一边，拣取了一些合适的配套药物给明日香。每种药都贴着标签，清楚易懂。比起另外那些他们本来要做却没能做成的事，这一件实在是太过于简单明确。

Next, he stopped at the convenience store. The aisles were as empty as they’d been yesterday, and he murmured a hello to no one in particular as he pilfered sports drinks, iced coffees, and candy for breakfast. Honestly, how did Misato do this so often?

之后，他在便利店门口停住脚步。和昨天没差别，过道依然空无一人。他朝着空气咕哝了一句“你好”，然后搜刮了一些运动饮料，冰咖啡和糖果充作早点。说句实在话，美里小姐经常这样做心不会累吗？

~

The night before, as they lay down to sleep, stomachs groaning, Asuka had turned to Shinji.

“You were awful to me,” she said. “The last time we slept in the same bed.”

“What?”

“You remember.”

“When I, uh, tried to kiss you?”

前一天夜里，他们躺下入睡之前，肚子还在咕噜噜地叫。明日香转头望向真嗣。

“你对我态度很差。”她说，“就是上一次我们睡同一张床的时候。”

“什么？”

“你自己心里有数。”

“呃，是我尝试吻你的那次？”

“No, idiot.” She stared at him, waiting for the light of understanding to grace his dull face. “You don’t remember?”

“No… Did I do something wrong? I did, didn’t I?”

No. No. No. That was wrong. He had to remember. It didn’t make sense if he didn’t remember.

“不是，笨蛋。”她盯着他，等待他木讷讷的脸上灵光乍现，“你不记得了？”

“不记得……我做了什么不好的事？肯定做了，对不对？”

不，不，不。哪里搞错了。他必须记得，不然根本说不过去！

“Shinji, please, tell me you remember.”

“Asuka,” he scowled. “Give me a clue. Remember what?”

No. They were just drunk. It was too painful otherwise.

“Nevermind,” she scowled. She turned her head away but when she felt his hand touch hers, she rolled over to him, burrowing into him as best she could, praying that her skull would leave her in peace somehow.

“真嗣，拜托，告诉我你记得。”

“明日香，”他板着脸说，“给我点头绪吧。究竟是什么事？”

不。他们只是醉得意识不清了，要不然，她受不了那样的痛苦。

“别管了。”她沉下脸，把头转了过去，但是当她感觉他碰到她的手，又翻过身，用力钻进他的怀抱，祈祷着她快疼炸了的脑门子能够消停一会儿。

It was a night months ago, when they still lived together with Misato in a queer approximation of a family. Asuka rose and drifted into the bathroom, as if in a dream.

She stared at herself in the mirror, she remembered. Marshalling courage like a general under fire, rallying her troops.

那是一个月前的夜晚，他们和美里同居，三人勉强凑成一个奇妙的家庭。明日香起身去洗手间，像是魂不守舍。

她还记得，她凝望着镜中的自己。鼓足了勇气，就像一个顶着炮火连天的将军想要集结起她的军队。

“This sucks,” she scowled. “Why do I have to be the one to do this?”

She plunged the bathroom into darkness and let her feet guide her to Shinji’s room. She paused at the threshold, listened to his breaths spilling softly into the air. The quiet hum of his SDAT player. She stepped inside and slid shut the door.

“逊毙了。”她阴沉着面孔，“为什么非得我做不可呢？”

她离开洗手间，把黑暗留在身后，任凭双腿机械地引她去真嗣的房间。她在门槛处停顿，听着他的呼吸声轻轻地飘散在空气中，听着SDAT播放器发出安静的哼鸣。她走进去，关上身后的移门。

“You will hold me,” she told him, in a whisper, not caring one bit when he didn’t react. She had already decided what to do.

Lowering herself delicately over him, she balanced herself, letting her night shirt tickle his nose. That would do it. If he awoke right now, he’d open his eyes, see her bared for him and—

Nothing.

“你会抱我的吧。”她对他说，只是一句低语。他没有回答，她也完全不在乎。她早已决定好了该做的事。

小心翼翼地低下身，趴在他上面，她稳住重心，用睡衣短袖轻撩他的鼻翼。一定能奏效的。如果他此时正好醒来，一睁眼就能看见她为他展开的裸姿，然后——

没有反应。

Fine. A heavy sleeper. Or playing hard to get. She lowered herself closer to him, her thighs against his, her breath on his face.

Nothing.

Ach, du heilige Scheisse…（哦，你这个混蛋...）

行吧。他睡得太沉，或是她得再加把劲。她放低身子，靠他更近些，她的大腿与他紧贴，她的呼吸拂过他的面。

毫无动静。

She slid her hand under his shirt, rested it on his belly for a second, and then drifted down. She found her quarry and was briefly pleased when it responded to her exactly how she’d planned. There was no question that he wanted this, then. She moved her hand and a moan tumbled out of his lips.（-日常为英→中的动词而困扰）

她把手伸到他的短袖下面，在他的小肚子上停留了一秒，继续往下摸。她逮住了目标，那东西如所预料的那样回应了，让她短暂地兴奋了一下。毋庸置疑，他肯定喜欢这样。她保持手的移动，一声呻吟挣开了他的双唇。

Wake up, Shinji, she commanded in her heart. Wake up and see what I’m doing. Look how pathetic I am. See how lonely I am. I’ll do anything, just so long as you touch me and hold me. You’re the only one who’ll ever know how low I’ll sink just to feel something, so please wake up. Please. Please, Shinji, wake up and do whatever you want to me. Please, please, please, Shinji—

快醒来，真嗣，她在心里命令道。醒来，看我在做什么！瞧瞧我有多可怜，看看我有多孤单。我会做任何事，只要你愿意摸我，抱我。你将是唯一发现我会为了一己之欲能堕落到何种地步的人，所以求你了醒来吧。拜托了，拜托了，真嗣，醒过来，你想对我做什么都可以。求求你，求求你，求求你了，真嗣——

He groaned and she felt something hot and wet on her hand. She pulled it out and sat back on her heels. She stared at the slime on her palm in the moonlight streaming through his window.

他呻吟了一声，她感觉有什么很烫很湿的东西在她手上。她抽出手，屈膝坐在脚后跟上。借窗外透进来的月光，她凝视着手心银白色的粘液。（-多加了个修饰词）

Playing with me.（-是指真嗣耍她玩，还是她的祈求？） He’d rather ignore me than touch me, she thought. Why is this so hard? Why does everyone hate me? Why won’t someone hold me? First Mama, then Kaji, and now Shinji—

和我一起玩。她心想，他宁愿无视我，也不愿碰我。为什么会这么艰难？为什么每个人都恨我？为什么没有人愿意抱我？先是妈妈，后是加持，现在是真嗣——

She left him and returned to the bathroom. She washed her hands three times and still they didn’t feel clean.

“I’m scum,” she whispered, and pressed her palms to her face.

她离开了他，回到洗手间。她把手洗了三遍，仍然觉得它们不干净。

“我是个贱人。”她小声说，把脸埋入手心。

Somehow, being in this apartment again brought this memory back and Asuka watched herself cry, alone, in the bathroom all night long until the soft clink of coffee being made hooked her cheek and dragged her back to consciousness.

不知为何，再次回到公寓，这份记忆也跟着回来了。明日香看见她自己，孤零零的一个人，在盥洗室里彻夜哭泣，直到咖啡的热气熏蒸上了她的脸颊，才把她拉回现实中。

“Oh,” he said with a soft smile that she wanted to smack off his face. She hovered in the doorway, every muscle yearning for more sleep. “You’re awake. Good morning.”

“I feel,” she announced. “Like shit.”

“喔，”他说，笑容欠揍般地温柔，她想往他脸上扇一耳光。她在门口徘徊着，每寸肌肉都精疲力竭，索要更多的休息。“你醒了啊。早上好。”

“我感觉，”她说，“烂透了。”

“Here—“ he said, and pressed a blue bottle into her hands. “It’s electrolytes, so I think it’ll help. Misato would drink this stuff sometimes.”

“这个给你——”他说，把一瓶蓝色的饮料塞到她手里。“是电解质，所以我想应该有帮助。美里小姐有时也会喝的。”

“That’s how you know you have a problem,” she muttered, but she wasn’t above following the example of their departed guardian. She chugged half the bottle in a single gulp and collapsed at the table. Shinji had covered it with candy; many of her favorites, in fact. She nibbled at a few pieces while he made breakfast.

“一旦到了想要喝这玩意儿的时候，你就知道自己有问题了。”她嘟囔道，但她也学了他们监护人的榜样，一口气灌了半瓶入肚，然后瘫在了餐桌边的座位上。真嗣在桌上放了许多糖果；实不相瞒，很多都是她的最爱。她咀嚼其中几颗时，他去做了早饭。

He placed a plate in front of her and she murmured something like a thank you. They ate, mostly without words, until Asuka caught sight of her hand and shuddered.

“You really don’t remember that night.”

“What?”

“That night I came to you.”

He shook his head. Her cheeks began to flush and her eyes felt hot.

“I thought you were—rejecting me.”

他做完早餐，把盘子放在她面前，她咕哝了一句类似感谢的话。他们开动了，几乎全程没有交流，直到明日香瞧见自己的手，打了个寒战。

“你真的不记得那天发生了什么吗？”

“什么？”

“就是我来找你的那个晚上。”

他摇头。她的脸颊开始泛红，双目刺痛。

“我以为你——你拒绝了我。”

“Asuka, what are you talking about? I, uh, did try to kiss you, kind of. That one time. When we were training together.”

“No, idiot, not that. I remember that.”

“明日香，你在说什么呢？我，呃，是想过要亲你啦。就那一次。我们一起训练的时候。”

“不，笨蛋，不是那次。我记得那件事。”

She took a breath and told him what she’d done. Her eyes remained on her palm until she’d told him everything and then, only then, did she allow her gaze to rise and meet his.

“I had no idea,” he whispered. “Really.”

“No. There’s no way.”

“Seriously.”

她吸了一口气，把她做的全告诉他了。期间，她的眼睛一直盯着手心。直到她道出了全部，只有那时，她才敢抬起眼眸，和他对视。

“我不知道。”他轻声说，“真的。”

“不。这没可能。”

“我说的是实话。”

“I thought you hated me so much you wouldn’t even wake up when I was touching you.” Her voice was small. Trembling. Exactly how she felt. “No one—no one loved me. I remember screaming and crying in the bath and neither of you, not even Misato, came to me. I hated you for hating me.”

“I never hated you, Asuka.”

“But you must hate me now. How could you not?”

“我以为你是那样恨我，以至于我碰你的时候，你都不肯睁开眼睛。”她的声音细微。发着抖。正应了她那时的心情。“没有人——没有人爱我。我记得在浴室里尖叫，哭泣，而没有一个人，甚至连美里也没有，来关心我。我讨厌你恨我的事实。”

“我从来不恨你，明日香。”

“但你现在也该恨我了。你怎么能不恨呢？”

“I don’t want to hate anyone.”

“Hate is like love. You can’t control who you hate or who you love. It just happens.”

“Fine,” he said. “I still don’t hate you. I wish I had woken up. Maybe everything would be different now. Maybe we’d—“

“我谁也不想恨了。”

“恨就像爱一样。你不可能控制自己去恨谁，或者爱谁。它就是那样发生了。”

“好吧，”他说，“但我还是不恨你。我希望我那时能醒来。也许一切都会不一样。也许我们能——”

“I don’t want to think about that anymore. It hurts too much.” She let the feeling of loss hang in the air for another moment. “You don’t hate me?”

“No.”

“Liar. You raped me and tried to kill me. And somehow, I still hate myself more than I hate you.”

“我不愿去往那个方面去想了，只会让我难过至死。”她让这份怅然若失的感觉悬留在半空，“你不恨我？”

“不恨。”

“骗子。你侵犯了我，还想要杀了我。不知怎么搞的，我还是恨我自己超过恨你。”

“I’m sorry.”

“Then prove it.”

“How?”

“对不起。”

“那就证明一下。”

“怎么做？”

She had nothing. They watched each other for a few moments and then he rose. He circled the table and leaned into her. She smelled his scent and cooking oil and soy sauce and sweat, all encircling her as he draped his arms around her neck. She gave a pathetic little mewl and she despised whichever corner of her heart that escaped from as she stiffened. （-这里意译咯？）He held her, and the warmth seduced her. She placed a hand on the arm over her chest and reached for his face.

她不再言语。有一会儿，他们只是望着对方，而后，他站了起来，绕过餐桌，向她倾身。他用双臂轻轻勾绕住她的颈窝，他的体香，油烟味，酱油味还有汗味，全都把她包围了。她发出了一声哀怜的、细小的呜咽，又板直了身体，无论是内心哪一部分在纵容她，她都不想承认那是自己发出的。他抱着她，这温暖令她沉醉。她把一只手伸到环绕她胸口的手臂上方，摸着了他的脸庞。

“Why…” she murmured.

“What?”

“Why does this feel so good?”

“为什么……”她喃喃道。

“什么？”

“为什么感觉这么好呢？”

~

Cleaning the kitchen was a small, simple thing, but it was something he could do with a beginning, middle, and end. Something he could finish and sit back and remember how it had been different at the beginning. （-想了半天，意译了x）Something he could tell himself was finished.

It wasn’t this hellish limbo, he knew.

打扫厨房是件简单的小活，这是一件能按部就班完成的事，是完工后能一屁股坐下来欣赏自己劳动成果的事，是一件做完以后能告诉自己“已经大功告成”的事。

至少他有十足的把握，而不像别的事那样不确定。

Asuka showered and he dressed her wounds again. They said nothing to one another. Once, when something stung, she reached for him and he caught her hand, gripping her tight, and she made a sound that almost seemed pleased, as if she’d been sure that he’d disappeared somehow.

明日香洗了澡，他又给她处理了伤口。他们没有和对方说话。只有一次，她感觉哪里疼了，就把手伸向他，他紧紧地攥着她的手，她发出了类似喜悦的声音，好像她不用再担心他会不明缘由地消失。

He showered too and found her dressing in her room, the door open. That was unusual for her, but what was normal these days?

“Asuka, here’s your medicine. I can read the kanji to you. If there are any you don’t know. You should read the instructions before you take it.”

他也洗了澡，然后看见她在自己的房间里换衣服，门是开着的。对她这种人来说是这很不寻常的现象，不过这些日子还有什么事能称得上寻常呢？

“明日香，这是你的药。如果你有哪里不明白，我可以给你读上面的汉字。用药之前，你应该先看说明书。”

She scowled and snatched them out of his hand.

“Obviously, I know that.”

她板着脸，从他手里夺过了它们。

“这种事我当然知道了。”

She’d pulled out jeans today and the same sweatshirt, which seemed to have escaped the worst of the previous night’s indulgences. That reminded him—he ought to do some laundry today. There were dirty clothes left from before Third Impact, even some from before Asuka ran away which he and Misato had left in her room, as if they could lure her back by expecting her to wash them herself.

她今天穿了牛仔裤，上身还是同样的运动衫，似乎从昨晚的放纵中逃过一劫，没有染上污秽。这提醒了他——他今天该洗衣服了。三冲之前就有很多脏衣服留下了，甚至有些还是明日香离家出走之前，他和美里丢在她房间里的，好像这么做他们可以叫她回家来洗掉自己的衣服似的。

Should he even wash Misato’s clothes? He’d done it before, so that wasn’t the issue, but washing clothes for someone you’d seen die still seemed like a strange ritual he wasn’t prepared for. Should they create a grave for her? Should they create graves for everyone?

“Shinji, what are you staring at?”

“Sorry,” he stuttered. “I was… thinking about laundry.”

他应该把美里的衣服也洗掉吗？他之前也做过，所以问题不大，但是给一位曾死在你面前的人洗衣服，就像是某种毫无准备的陌生仪式。他们应该为她做个墓吗？还是他们应该给所有人都搭上墓碑？

“真嗣，你在看什么？”

“对不起，”他结巴地说，“我……只是在想洗衣服的事。”

“Mein Gott, you really are an idiot. Well, I left my dirty things on the floor so feel free to wash them. Don’t be a pervert about it, though.”

“What? I’ve done your laundry before. It’s nothing I haven’t seen.”

Still, she rolled her eyes and pushed past him.

“Where are you going?”

“Mein Gott,你真是个笨蛋呐。那我把脏衣服都扔在地上，想洗就洗吧。不过，别对它们打什么下流的主意。”

“什么？我之前就洗过你的衣服呀。能看的都看见过了。”

她还是翻了个白眼，挤过他身边。

“你要去哪儿？”

“For a walk. I’m still pretty weak but sitting around here isn’t going to change that. And I’ll go insane if I sit here any longer.”

Shinji bowed his head.

“Are you coming back?” he asked and something in Asuka’s posture caught his eye: a tremor of surprise. Did I get it right, he wondered, or had she not even considered leaving?

“去散个步。虽然我还是没什么力气，但一直坐着也无济于事。要是再这么呆坐下去，我准得发疯。”

真嗣垂下脑袋。

“你还会回来吗？”他问道。明日香的神态中有什么吸引了他的目光，是一阵讶异感。是我猜中了她的心思，他心想，还是她根本没考虑过离家出走？

“Probably,” she said with a shrug. She tilted her head back, an imperious little gesture that he remembered from the old days of a few months ago. “I mean, where else am I going to find someone to wait on me hand and foot? Not unless more people start to wake up.”

“Asuka,” he said as she started for the door again. “Do you think more will come back?”

“可能吧。”她耸了耸肩说道。她把头往后一仰，这是一个盛气凌人的小动作，让他联想起她几个月前，还没有被生活所摧残时的样子。“我的意思是，我还能上哪儿去找一个心甘情愿等我回家的人呢？除非有更多的人苏醒。”

“明日香，”当她走向门口时，他又问，“你觉得还有人会回来吗？”

“Probably.” She gave a short, bitter laugh. “I mean, it’s not like being in that big lake is all that much fun, is it?”

“Why did we come back first, then?”

“可能会。”她发出一声苦涩的、短促的笑音，“我是说，一直呆在那个湖里也没什么意思吧？”

“那，为什么最先回来的是我们呢？”

“We probably hate ourselves more than anyone else in the world. Or maybe we’re so insufferable that everyone else voted us out and made us think it was our own choice.”

He found himself smiling in spite of everything.

“That’s pretty dark, Asuka.”

“可能我们恨自己，超过了恨世界上的其他人。或者可能我们太惹人厌了，大家投票把我们踢了出去，并且让我们以为是自己的意愿。”

虽然话不中听，他发现自己还是笑了。

“你的想法好黑暗，明日香。”

She turned on her heels, grinning, a child pleased at her own joke.

“Right? I bet that was it.”

“And they made sure we’d wake up together, so we can torture each other,” he added. Her grin grew bigger and she leaned against a wall.

她转动脚跟，微笑，对自己讲的笑话感到孩子气般的满意。

“是吧？我打赌就是那样子的。”

“他们还确保我们会一起醒来，这样我们就可以折磨对方了。”他加了一句。她的笑容变深了，人倚在墙边。

“Now it all makes sense! This is probably what NERV was designed for. Just to torture you and me, specifically.”

“Obviously. That’s why they made us live together.”

“Seriously! Only a real sadist could have come up with that. It was probably your dad.”

“现在一切都说得通了！这可能就是NERV设计好的阴谋，特地为了折磨咱俩！”

“显然。这就是为什么他们叫我们住在一块儿。”

“是真的！只有一个虐待狂才会想出这般主意。很可能是你爸。”

“That does sound like him, doesn’t it?”

She turned to leave but stopped once more:

“Hey, Shinji—if I didn’t come back, would you go looking for me?”

“Huh? Yeah, of course.” He waited for any other clues in her body language. “You’re all I have left.”

“What if other people wake up? What if Misato comes back? Would you still go looking for me?”

“听起来就像他会做的事，不是吗？”

她转身要离开，又再次停下来：

“嘿，真嗣——如果我没有回家，你会出去找我吗？”

“呃？嗯，当然了。”他等着她的肢体语言能给他点头绪。“你是我仅有的。”

“如果其他人也苏醒了呢？如果美里回来了呢？你还会来找我吗？”

“Of course.”

“Liar.”

“I would!”

“You didn’t, last time,” she scowled（-吐槽一下这个词用得好频繁，我词穷了x） and dipped out the door before he could come up with a response. He sighed, and went to start gathering their laundry when he saw the medication sitting on her bed.

“She didn’t even take it,” he whispered to himself.

“当然。”

“骗子。”

“我会的！”

“上次，你就没有。”他还没来得及想出合适的回答，她就板着面孔出门去了。他叹息，去整理他要洗的衣物，这时他看见了她床头的药品。

“她甚至一颗都不吃。”他小声对自己说。

~

It took her a while to find what she wanted. Not because she wanted to use it, but because she just wanted to—well, she didn’t know what she wanted to do with it.（-这里的It是指下面的商店？）

A small men’s boutique a few kilometers from the apartment. Far enough that Shinji wouldn’t stumble upon it if he went out while she was gone. She let herself in, walked past the crumpled suits, soaked through with LCL, and found the belts. She selected a thick leather one, long and black, and found a chair. Once upon a time, someone would have sat there to try on shoes or rest in between interminable suit fittings.

花了好一会儿她才找到合适的地方。

距离公寓几公里外有一家小型男装店。这个距离足够远，即使真嗣出门，也不可能和她巧遇。她走进店里，经过那些被LCL沾湿，皱成一团的衣服，找到了一些皮带。她选了一根厚厚的、皮革材质的，细而乌黑的皮带，再找了把椅子。曾经，有人坐在上面试鞋子，或是在无休止的换衣间隙中小憩。

Now, Asuka balanced atop it. She still wasn’t tall enough, so she piled a few boxes on the seat until she could reach the shop’s rafters.

“This is how she did it,” she murmured as she looped the belt around the rafters. “Mama.” She tied it off and made another loop with the buckle.（-仔细读这里的时候心都悬起来了）

Of course, she wasn’t going to do it. She just wanted to know that she could, if she needed to.

现在，却是明日香站在上面。她还不够高，所以她还在椅子上面叠了几个盒子，这样她就能碰到天花板的椽子了。

“她之前就是这么干的。”她嘴里念叨着，将皮带绕了椽子一圈。“妈妈。”她把它系好，用皮带扣又再绕了一圈。

当然，她不打算这样做。她只是想知道她是否能做到——如果有必要的话。

But—

It couldn’t hurt to try putting her head through it? Just to make sure.

And maybe—

There’d be an accident—

And she wouldn’t have to—

No.

但是——

把她的头放上去，也不会疼吧？只是想确认一下。

也许——

就像遇到一场意外——

她就不用再——

不。

As she touched the leather loop to her neck, she felt something still there, as if she’d been branded. Across her collar bone, something tingled and she sighed. It was where he’d laid his arm.

“Why do I want his warmth so badly?” she whispered as she climbed down from the chair. I’m pathetic.

她抓着皮革环放到脖子下面，感到仍然有东西在她身上，就像她被烙上了印记。沿着她的锁骨是隐隐约约的刺疼感，她叹了口气。这是他手一度搭着的地方。

“为什么我这么想要他的温暖呢？”她轻声说着从椅子上爬下来。我真是可怜。

I shouldn’t want this from someone who hurt me so badly, she told herself. I shouldn’t want him. I should hate him. I should be scared of him. I want to hate him. I want to hate him. I want to him.（-笔误还是有意为之？）

The elevator dinged to their floor and with each step, she heard the words in her skull.

I want to hate you, Idiot-Shinji. I want to hate you, Idiot-Shinji. I—

“’m home,” she murmured. Shinji leaned out of the kitchen.

我不应该指望从一个伤我如此深的人那里得到这东西，她对自己说。我不应该想要他。我应该恨他。我应该害怕他。我想要恨他。我想要恨他。我想要他。

电梯叮咚一声到他们的楼层了。每走一步，她都感觉这些话在她的脑子里胀开。

我想要恨你，笨蛋真嗣。我想恨你，笨蛋真嗣。我——

“我回来了。”她嘀咕道。真嗣从厨房里探出身。

“Welcome back! How was your walk?”

“Fine,” she grunted. She sniffed the air. It was stuffy in the apartment. It smelled like meat and apples, sweet scents from a forgotten homeland so far away from these islands in the Pacific.

“What are you making?” she murmured, drifting over to him.

“欢迎回来！散步怎么样？”

“还行。”她嘟哝了一声。她嗅了嗅空气。公寓里空气不流通。她闻到像肉类和苹果般的气味，是来自与太平洋的这些岛屿相隔甚远的、被遗忘的故乡的甜蜜气味。

“你在做什么？”她晃到他身边，喃喃问道。

“Ah, well, uh, I went out today too,” he said. He was already blushing from the heat and he grinned in that sheepish way she hated sometimes and—didn’t hate—other times. “And I found a German cookbook. I mean, it’s written in Japanese, of course. But I thought you’d like it. I found some frozen meat since all the fresh stuff has gone bad. I figured I’d make schnitzel, since it’s not so different from tonkatsu? And some potatoes and baked apples too. It seems like it’s autumn now, so it feels right, doesn’t it?”

“啊，嗯，呃，我今天也出去了。”他说。他的脸已经因为热气而泛红，他用那种，她有时候讨厌——有时又不讨厌的羞怯方式微笑。“我找了一本德国料理的食谱。当然，书本身是用日本语写的。但我想你会喜欢它。我找了点冻肉，因为所有新鲜的食材都坏了。我决定要做schnitzel，应该和豚骨差不多？还有土豆和烘过的苹果也是。现在感觉像到了秋天，所以也挺应季的，不是吗？”

She stared at him. Her stomach turned flips of hunger and pleasure.

“Not that I really know what autumn is like. I’ve only read about it.”

She left the kitchen without saying a word and Shinji called after her: “It’ll be ready in fifteen or twenty minutes.” She forced herself into her room and forced herself to sit down. She wrapped her arms around her body and held herself there until her heart resumed its normal rhythm, until the desire to pin him against a wall and drown herself in him subsided.（-只是感觉沉溺啊、淹死啊这种词都不大对味hh）

她望着他，她的肚子因为饥饿和快乐而翻腾不已。

“虽然我也不知道秋天大概是什么感觉。我只从书上读到过。”

她一言不发地离开了厨房，真嗣在她后面说：“十五到二十分钟就好了。”她强迫自己进到卧室，又强迫自己坐下。她用双臂抱住身体，就这样紧紧抱着自己，直到她的心跳恢复到了正常的频率，直到那想要将他按压到墙上，将自己全然交付于他的渴望逐渐退去。

Next to her was the medicine, sterile packaging staring at her.

Well, one more night wouldn’t make a difference, would it? she wondered, picking it up and laying it to the side.

在她旁边放着药品，包装得一丝不漏。

嗯，多一个晚上也不会有什么区别吧，会有吗？她想着，把药拿起来，放在一旁。

“I guess neither of us ate much for breakfast or lunch,” Shinji chuckled politely as Asuka dug into her plate. The pleased grunts and slurps erupting occasionally from her lips had been the only thing she’d offered him once they sat down.

“There’s Misato’s beer too, but after last night—“

She shook her head and he abandoned that offer.

“我猜我们两个早饭和中饭吃得都不够多。”当明日香在狼吞虎咽的时候，真嗣发出斯文的轻笑。从坐下到现在，她的嘴里就时不时地发出着满足的咕噜和吞咽声，完全没功夫和他说话。

“美里的啤酒还有些多的，不过昨天晚上——”

她摇摇头，他放弃了提议。

“I’m, uh, glad you came back, Asuka. When I didn’t run into you on my errands, I thought you might have gotten into trouble.”

“我，嗯，很高兴你回来，明日香。当我出门没碰到你的时候，我想你可能遇上了什么麻烦。”

She swallowed her mouthful and sat back, breathing deep. He had no right to make German food this perfect. Especially for his first time cooking it. And in a post-apocalyptic hellscape, no less.

“What kind of trouble could I have gotten into?” she asked suddenly. He can’t know. There’s no way. But what if he—saw? What if he passed by the shop? What if he’s lying?

她咽下了嘴里的食物，背靠回椅子上，深深吸了一口气。他没有权利把德国菜做得这么无可挑剔，尤其他还是第一次！就算身处世界末日之后的极端恶劣环境之下，这也太超过了。（-不知道能不能这样翻哈哈哈）

“我还能遇上什么麻烦？”她突兀地问。他不能知道。不可能知道。但万一……他看到了怎么办？如果他刚好经过了商店？如果他在撒谎……？

“I just meant if you got lost or something. The city’s kind of different now.”

“Right.” She set back to her plate, trying to cut through the hunger simmering in her gut. Even as juices ran down her lips, as she savored tastes and scents she hadn’t experienced in nearly a year, a hunger remained.

“我的意思是，你可能会迷路之类的。这座城市和以前不太一样了。”

“好吧。”她继续，想要绞杀在她内心沸腾的饥饿感。即使当果汁滑入她的唇口间，当她享受到了将近一年未体验过的味与香，那份饥渴之欲仍然躁动难宁。

“Hey, Shinji,” she said suddenly. “What would you have done if I woke up?”

“What?”

“In the hospital.”

“Oh.”

“What would you have done?”

“嘿，真嗣，”她突然发问，“如果我那时醒了，你会怎么做？”

“什么？”

“医院里。”

“噢。”

“你会怎么做？”

“I… don’t know. I wanted you to wake up, though.”

“Why? You’d have gotten in trouble.”

“I didn’t care,” he shrugged. “I just felt so alone and I just wanted something—“

“Warm,” she supplied for him.

“Yeah, exactly.”

“我……不知道。虽然，我很想让你醒过来。”

“为什么？你会引火上身。”

“我不在乎。”他耸耸肩，“我只是觉得太孤单了，我只是想要一些——”

“温暖。”她为他补充。

“是啊，一点没错。”

“I saw your memories though. I know it sucked. It would have been way better if I were awake.”

“Yeah, that was only one of the problems.”

“If I’d been awake,” she said. “I would have probably let you.”

“I… I never thought you were interested in that.”

“不过我看到了你的记忆。我知道你的脑子是一团糟。如果我醒着，事情会好得多。”

“是的，那是其中一件问题。”

“如果我醒着，”她说，“我可能会由着你。”

“我……我从来没想过你对那种事感兴趣。”

“Apparently,” she sighed. “It’s not that I don’t feel violated. It’s just that after everything the Angels and NERV did to me, everything you did feels kind of wimpy, you know?”

“很明显，”她叹气道，“不是说我没觉得被侵犯到。只是在经历过那些使徒和NERV对我做的一切之后，你做的任何事就显得有点小儿科了，你明白吗？”

He bowed his head. Don’t cry, idiot, she thought to herself.

“I wish I’d woken up,” she said. “I probably would have slapped you but I wouldn’t have let you leave. I’d have made you stay with me in bed until they dragged you away.”

“That… would have been nice.”

She could see him blushing. Good.

他低下头。别哭啊，笨蛋，她在心里想着。

“我希望我能醒过来。”她说，“我可能会扇你一巴掌，但我不会让你走的。我会要你陪我在床上，直到他们把你拖走。”

“那……听上去很好。”

她能看见他脸颊泛红。好极了。

“I wonder how long we would have had. A few hours? Maybe the whole night? We could have gotten up to so much trouble. So much better than the dumb stuff we tried with each other.”

“I’m sure,” he said, still not looking her. She bit her lip. Look at me, damn it.

“Because it sounds like we both wanted the same thing, right?”

“我想知道我们会躺在那儿多久。几个小时？也许整个晚上？我们可能会惹上一大堆麻烦。那也比我们对彼此做的蠢笨事好上太多了。”

“肯定的。”他说，仍然没看她。她咬住了嘴唇。见鬼，看着我说话啊。

“因为听上去我们两个都想要同一件东西，对吧？”

“Yeah… Yeah, I guess. I was just so afraid of—“ and now he looked at her. “Being rejected. I felt like you were also rejecting me.”

“Idiot,” she whispered. “That’s what I always felt.”

“I felt like you hated me.”

“是……是啊，我猜是的。我只是太害怕……”他终于望向了她，“被你拒绝。我感觉你也一直在抗拒我。”

“笨蛋，”她低声说，“那是我的感受。”

“我感觉你恨我。”

“Only because I hated myself. You can’t love anything if you hate yourself. You can’t even like anything. It’s like half the world is just dead to you.”

“I know. But—even if it hurts, it doesn’t mean it’ll always hurt. Living, I mean.”

“只是因为我恨恶我自己。如果你恨自己，你就不能爱别人。你甚至不能喜欢他们。这就像是半个世界对你封闭了一样。”

“我知道。但是——即使会受伤，也不意味着会一直痛苦下去。我的意思是，活着的话。”

He was looking at her and Asuka was afraid for the first time since the beach. Not for her life, but for her heart, because she was sure that he knew what she’d done that afternoon.

他一直盯着她，这是明日香自沙滩以来第一次感到畏惧。不是惧怕生存，而是惧怕她的内心，因为她确信他已经知道了那个下午她做了什么事。

“Do you promise?” she whispered.

“Promise what?”

“That it won’t always hurt?”

“Yes. I think so, at least.”

“Then I’ll stay here with you.”

“I’m glad,” he whispered.

“你能保证吗？”她小声问。

“保证什么？”

“不会一直痛苦下去？”

“是的。至少我认为是。”

“那我就和你一起待在这儿。”

“我很高兴。”他轻轻地回应。

This time, she helped him clean up. There was a big mess from the deep frying and even though he’d assured her she needn’t help him, she worked, silently, alongside him till the tiny kitchen practically gleamed.

Later, when she thought back to that night, she tried to remember which one of them made the first move. Asuka was positive it was her, but the first thing she remembered was sitting with him on the balcony, in his arms, then on his lap.

这一回，她帮他一起打扫卫生。到处都是油炸的污迹。即使他保证说不用劳烦她，她还是安安静静地干了活，和他一块儿，把小小的厨房间清理得光洁透亮。

以后，当她回想起那天晚上，她试着回忆是谁先发起了第一步。明日香很确信是她自己，但她能想到的第一件事是他们坐在阳台，她在他的臂弯里，在他的两膝上。

“We could jump together,” she had said at one point. “And never deal with this world again.”

“Do you think we’d go back to the LCL?” he wondered aloud. “Just… reset?”

“Maybe. I don’t want that. I’d rather disappear.”

“You don’t think there’s a heaven? Or a hell?”

“我们可以一起跳下去。”某个点上她这么说，“再也用不着应付这个世界了。”

“你觉得我们会变回LCL吗？”他问出了心中的想法，“只是……重置？”

“也许。但我不想要那样。我宁可直接消失才好。”

“你不相信会死后会有天堂？或是地狱？”

“Shinji, with everything we’ve seen—do you?”

“No.”

“Exactly.”

“But… I wish there were. I wish there were another side to this.”

“真嗣，凭着我们见识到的一切来说，你信吗？”

“不信。”

“那就好了。”

“但是……我希望有。我希望世界有另一侧。”

She found his face in the darkness with her hands. She ran her fingertips over it. Found his lips.

“But there’s only this.” She could melt into him. Sink, once more, into the primordial soup（-化用了一下香香的角色歌心よ原始に戻れ）, but this time, it would be him. “Hey, do you want to kiss? I’m bored.”

She felt him shake with a soft, silent laugh. “Sure.”

在黑暗中，她的双手摸着他的脸颊，用指尖滑过它，找到了他的双唇。

“但只有这个。”她可以融化进他的体内。再一次，沉溺，让心、回归原始，但这次，对象是他。“嘿，想接吻吗？我正好无聊。”

她感觉到了他内心的震颤，以一个无声的、温柔的笑容体现出来。“好。”

“You brushed your teeth?”

“Yeah.”

“Then here I go,” she whispered, though she only had a few inches to move. She hesitated when she felt the tickle of his breath on her upper lip. She was about to say something when he spoke.

“你刷过牙了吗？”

“刷了。”

“那我上了。”她轻声说，虽然她只需要往前移动几英寸就行了。当她感受到他的呼吸轻挠她的上唇，她犹豫了。她想要说什么，但他先开口了。

“Hey, stop breathing,” he ordered. “That tickles.”

He pinched her nose and kissed her. She pounded her first against his chest, but made no attempt to escape. Instead, she crushed her lips into his, hungrily, as they’d done once before, before she’d lost her nerve. Finally, with a gasp, she pushed away from him and he released her.

“嘿，不要呼气，”他命令道，“挠得我很痒。”

他捏住她的鼻子，吻了她。一开始她还用拳头锤他的胸口，但没有逃开的意思。相反，在她失去勇气之前，她将嘴唇用力紧贴住他的，饥渴地，正如第一次她做的那样。最后，伴着一声喘息，她将他推离，他也放开了她。

“Idiot,” she hissed through panting breaths.

“Sorry. I couldn’t help it.”

“Idiot.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Liar.”

“笨蛋。”在急喘的呼吸间，她嘶声道。

“对不起。我忍不住。”

“笨蛋。”

“对不起。”

“骗人。”

“You did that to me,” he said with a failing smile.

“I know. When I did it, it was…” She paused to lick her lips. How lonely they felt now… “Different.”

“Then show me how it was different, Asuka.”

“Inside,” she whispered. “I’m cold. Unless you keep me warm.”

“是你先这样做的。”他想挤出个微笑，但失败了。（-他半笑不笑地说。？）

“我知道。但我做的时候……”她停下来，舔了舔嘴巴。如今他们是多么寂寞啊……“和现在不一样。”

“那就告诉我区别在哪里，明日香。”

“到里面去。”她轻声说，“我很冷。除非你先让我暖和。”

It broke her heart how gentle he was with her. She arched her back, biting her tongue, until she remembered there was no reason to—the world had ended, they were the new Adam and Eve or something (this idea filled her with parental dread and she made a mental note to take the medication first thing in the morning). They were alone. She screamed and grinded her hips into his face.（-这个体位x）

“Shinji, it feels too good,” she hissed into the dark. “I’m gonna’ die. I’m gonna’ die. I can’t take it—“ She screamed and a few seconds later, she let him go. He took trembling gasps and she giggled.

“That’s how it’s different,” she whispered at the dark.

她心碎了。他触摸她的时候竟然是那么的轻柔。她弓起背，咬住舌头，直到她想起已经没有制止的理由——旧世界已然临到终焉，他们就像新世界的亚当和夏娃（这个念头吓坏了她，让她不忘记在第二天早上一下床就服了药）。他们是仅存的人类。她尖叫，臀部碾着他的脸。

“真嗣，这感觉也太棒了，”她在黑暗中呓语，“我要死了。我要死掉了。我忍不住了——”她尖叫，几秒后，她放开了他。他颤抖地喘了几声，她咯咯笑起来。

“这就是区别所在。”她向黑暗低语道。

（-这一整段镜头感爆炸了）

He helped her onto his hips. She’d insisted on the darkness. Her scars still ached and she knew they’d ache even harder if he could see them.

“Wait,” he whispered. “We don’t have any protection or anything.”

She sighed.

“I know you’re dumb, but try to keep up, idiot.”

“But—“

他扶她坐到自己的髋部上。她坚持不要开灯。她的伤疤仍然疼痛，她知道如果他看见了，它们会变得更疼。

“等一下，”他轻声说，“我们一点保护措施都没有做。”

她叹了口气。

“我知道你很迟钝，但你得努力跟上，笨蛋。”

“但是——”

“I’ll take the pills tomorrow. We’re fine for tonight.” She felt him relaxed beneath her, his hands holding her and guiding her as she found him.

“Does that feel okay? Does it hurt?”

“No. I mean yes. I mean—“ she sputtered. “It feels good. See, isn’t this better than trying when I’m asleep? Does it feel good?”

“Yeah. It feels really good.”

“明天我会吃药的啦。今晚没问题的。”她感到在下面的他放松了身子，他的手抱住她，引她找到自己。

“这样可以吗？会不会疼？”

“不。我的意思是，疼。但是——”她语无伦次地说，“感觉很棒。怎么样，是不是比我睡着的时候做要好多了？是不是很爽？”

“是啊，真的很舒服。”

She rested her weak muscles against him, feeling his closeness. He started to move beneath her, and she clung tight to him, crushing his face into her neck.

“You remember what I said,” she whispered in his ear. She bit it. Hard. He yelped. “What my body is supposed to look like.”

He grunted and she took this as an affirmation. She worked her fingers into his hair, dug her nails into his scalp, and sighed into his lips.

她将虚弱的肌肉安靠在他身上休憩，感受到了他的亲近。他开始她在下面移动，她紧紧地扣住他，让他的脸深深地埋入她的颈项。

“你记着我说过的话。”她冲他的耳朵低语，还咬了一口。狠狠的。他短促地叫了一声。“记住我的身体原本的样子。”

他咕哝了什么，她将其视为了他的二次保证。她的手指穿进他的发丝间，指甲把握住他的头皮，伴一声轻叹，她吻入了他的唇。

（-我化开了……）

~ A near constant dance of souls, interrupted only by brief sparks of dull sorrow and recognition.

近乎永恒的灵魂之舞，被空虚的悲伤和认知的短暂火花打断。

She had awoken here, dissolved into the others, the billions of others, and stayed like that. Like instant coffee flushed in hot water. But something wasn’t right. Something was off.

她清醒着，融化在了数以亿计的灵魂中间，保持着那样的状态。就像一杯速溶咖啡冲入了滚烫的热水。只是，有什么地方不对劲。有什么弄错了。

She really, really, really wanted a beer. She had no body with which to drink it. No stomach to digest it. No neural synapses for it to dull. This was a fatal flaw in Instrumentality, she had come to realize. No beer.

她真的，真的，真的非常想喝啤酒。她没有嘴巴可以喝它。没有肚子可以消化它。没有神经系统可以被它麻木。她渐渐意识到，这是人类补完的致命缺陷。没有啤酒！

You’re lonely even here.

It’s not that! I just really, really want a beer, Rei.

Even when joined with all of humanity, you’re still lonely.

Are you kidding? Here, I’m with you and Kaji and my dad and Ritsuko…

And yet—

你在这儿也很孤单。

不是这样！我只是真的，真的想喝啤酒，丽。

即使融入了全人类的意识，你也还是孤独的。

你在开玩笑吧？在这里，我和你，和加持，和我的父亲还有律子……

即便如此——

Oh, fine. I want to make sure they’re okay. Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong to want to be—I just want a beer, okay?

Why won’t you say it?

Say what?

I can see into your soul, the red eyes were saying. I know what you want. Your soul is part of mine.

Family. Is that what you want to hear? Is it so wrong that I liked living with them? It wasn’t professional or anything but I miss them both and I’m afraid for them out there.

噢，行吧。我只是想知道他们是不是平安。这有什么大问题吗？难道我想要——好吧，我只是想喝杯啤酒！这也有错吗？

为什么你不说出来呢？

说什么？

我可以看透你的灵魂，那双红眼睛这么说道。我知道你想要的。你的灵魂是我的一部分。

家庭。这就是你想听见的？我喜欢和他们生活在一起，有什么问题吗？没什么高深莫测的，我只是想念他们，怕他们在外面过得不好。

The eyes smiled. She could have sworn Rei was touching her face, even though she didn’t really have a face. Or—wait—did she now?

那双眼睛微笑了。她敢发誓说丽抚摸了她的脸，即使她没有脸可以摸。或是——等等，她现在有了？

It’s going to hurt. Going back. Major Katsuragi.

会很痛苦的。如果你回去的话，葛城少佐。

“And that’s what the beer is for!” she chirped. She had a voice again.

“那就是啤酒派上用场的地方！”她嘘声说。她又能发出声音了。

Even union with the entire human race cannot erase the loneliness in our hearts.

即使全人类的融合也无法驱散我们心灵的孤独。

“Rei,” she asked suddenly. She felt as though she were rising out of a warm bath after dozing off. “Are you lonely too?”

“丽，”她突然问。她感觉好像从温暖的温泉中缓缓升起，然后飘离。“你也觉得孤单吗？”

I… do not know.

我……不知道。

“You can tell me if you are. Do you have to stay in there? Do you know?”

“如果你孤单，你可以告诉我。你必须要待在这里吗？还是你也不知道？”

I do not know, Major Katsuragi.

我并不清楚，葛城少佐。

“NERV is probably gone, Rei. You don’t have to call me Major anymore.”

“NERV可能已经解体了，丽。你不用再称呼我少佐了。”

I like it. It makes me feel less alone. Isn’t that strange?

我喜欢这样叫。会让我感觉不是一个人。很奇怪吗？

“I bet Shinji would like it. If you came back.”

“我打赌真嗣会喜欢的。如果你回去的话。”

Perhaps. I do not know if—I—should. Please take care of them. She saw Rei smiling, for real now. A smile she’d never seen before. Not the terrifying, otherworldly smile of the heartless goddess who had ended the world but the smile of a shy girl, bidding farewell to a friend. I will tell them where you went. You want them to follow?

也许吧。我不知道我是不是——应该回去。请照顾好他们。她看见丽在笑，现在是真正的笑容。她以前从未见过的笑容。不是一个终结世界的无情女神那超凡可怖的笑容，而是一个害羞的女孩子，在和一位朋友说再见时的微笑。我会转告他们你去的地方。你希望他们跟过去吗？

“You do that,” Misato said, grinning at the thought. “Ritsuko and I need to get sloshed and debrief this whole mess.”

“你说吧。”美里说，这个念头让她微笑，“我和律子需要好好地大醉一场，并且收拾收拾这一团烂摊子。”

And Kaji. You’re hoping he’ll follow you. And then you’ll know for real if—

还有加持。你希望他会跟随你吧。然后你就会真的知道，如果——

The beach. Since when had there been a beach here?

沙滩。从什么时候开始，这里有沙滩了？

She struggled to her feet. Rei’s face stared at her, far off over the pale crimson sea. She tried to wave but the face gave no indication that it looked at anything. Around her, the mass-produced EVAs, crucified and lifeless, stared at her, staring at Rei.

她挣扎着站起来。远远地，在泛白的红色海岸对面，丽的脸盯着她瞧。她试着招手，但这张脸却没有在注视任何东西的迹象。在她周围，被肢解的量产机了无生气，凝视着她，也凝视着丽。

“What the hell,” she muttered. She was wearing everything she’d been wearing back then. Her jacket, skirt, and—something ached in her belly. She pulled her shirt up to find a cruel gash, badly scabbed, disfigured her stomach.

“It would have been nice to skip this,” she sighed and fingered the wound. She shuddered. It would need attention before too long, but at least it wasn’t going to start bleeding any time soon. She hoped.

“什么情况？”她咕哝道。她的穿着和她临死前是一样的。夹克外套，短裙，还有她腹部的疼痛感。她把衬衫掀起，找到了枪洞，在她的腹部结了疤，伤势严重。

“要是可以不还原这个就好了。”她叹气，用手指碰了碰伤口。她哆嗦起来。得赶快处理一下，不然就麻烦了，不过好在它已经止血了。她希望是这样。

Misato stretched her legs and exhaled. She saw her breath—for the first time in over a decade.

“Cold,” she whispered. “It’s cold.” It was November, after all. Right? Maybe? It should have been cold, but they’d lost seasons with the Second Impact. Now, though…

Something caught her eye.

美里屈伸了一下两腿，吐出一口长气。她见到了她呼出的气体——这是十多年来第一次。

“好冷啊，”她小声说，“天变冷了。”毕竟是十一月，对吧？也许？在以前是该这么冷，只是第二次冲击后，四季轮回的日子一去不复返。而如今……

有东西吸引了她的注意。

The cross. Her medallion. Nailed to a shard of debris. She let out a happy yelp and forced her legs to move, pumping them in an odd simulation of running. She tripped forward, hurled herself back to her feet, and kept running until she collapsed before the necklace.

It was a sign, she knew. She knew who’d left it, and she could read the message, meant only for her—we’re alive. Come find us.

With quaking fingers, she guided its descent around her neck. Her face was wet and her tears were warm. She wiped them with the sleeve of her jacket.

“Guys, hold on,” she whispered into the cold wind. “I’ll be home soon.”

是十字架，还有她的吊坠。十字架嵌在一处废墟上。她发出一声高兴的尖叫，强迫自己的双腿大力迈开，勉强有了在跑步的感觉。她向前跌绊，又拼命爬起来，继续奔跑，直到跌倒在那串项链坠饰前。

那是个标志，她知道。她知道谁把它留在这儿的，她能读懂其中的讯息，这对她只意味着一件事——我们还活着。来找我们吧。

她用颤抖的手指取下家族的遗物，挂回到自己的颈项上。她面颊湿润，沾满了热乎乎的眼泪。她用夹克衫的袖子擦去了眼泪。

“小家伙们，坚持住，”她对着寒冷的夜风轻声道，“我马上就回家见你们。”

It was a long way to walk but she felt her strength returning with each empty city block. She was hungry and thirsty, but she was alive. There was no doubt about this. The clack of her boots on the sidewalk, echoing in this ruined metropolis—this made her smile. She jumped. She could jump! She had a body again. She clicked her heels together and cried out.

“Look at me!” she squealed, half-delirious. “Look at me, dad. Look at me, Commander Ikari. Look at me, Kaji. Look at me, Ritsuko! I’m still standing!”

回家的路长得很，每经过一个空旷的街道，她的力量就恢复一分。她又饥又渴，但她是活着的。没有什么比这更毋庸置疑了。她的靴子在路面上发出的踢踏声，回荡在这个破败的大城市里——这令她快活。她跳跃。她跳起来了！她再次有了身体。她并拢高跟鞋，大喊出声。

“瞧瞧！”她几乎是神志不清地叫喊道，“瞧瞧我，爸爸。瞧瞧我，碇司令。瞧瞧我，加持。瞧瞧我，律子！我还站在这里耶！”

She kicked an empty car, minding its own business on the empty street. “Take that, lease payments! Just try and find me now! I’m never paying up!”

Misato pressed her hand to her chest. What was this mad joy? How had she never realized how wonderful the world was? She needed to tell them. They’d never experienced autumn before. They would go to see the leaves change colors. Drink warm tea and cocoa as the wind whipped their hair. Travel what remained of this beautiful world, together, because the strangest monsters of the universe, somehow, some way, hadn’t managed to kill them—

她踢了一脚无人的车辆。街上一个人影都没有，她爱干嘛就干嘛。“听好了，贷款们！尽管来找我吧！我再也不会还了，呸！”

美里用一只手按住胸口。这癫狂的喜悦感是怎么回事？她怎么从没有意识到这个世界是多么美妙呢？她需要告诉他们。他们从来没有经历过秋天。他们需要看看落叶变幻色彩。他们需要泡一杯热茶或可可暖暖身子。他们需要一同去游历世界的各个角落，因为这个宇宙最奇异的怪物们，不知出于什么样的原因，竟然没有把他们灭亡——

“Wait,” she said aloud, freezing in place. Her stomach rumbled in the stillness. “Where are they?”

“等等，”她僵在了原地。她的胃缩紧了。“他们在哪里？”

She’d started walking back to her apartment as if on auto-pilot but maybe that was wrong—what if they weren’t there? After all, why would they be there? The world was empty. They could have gone anywhere they wanted. They might not even be together. She’d just—assumed—that home to her was home to them. That they’d felt the same thing.

就好像大脑开了自动步行模式，她开始往公寓的方向走去，也许不对——假如他们不在那里呢？毕竟，为什么他们要去那儿？世界广阔而空荡，他们可以自由地去往任何地方。他们甚至可能不在一起。她只是——假定——那个居所也是他们心目中的家。假定，他们全都想的一样。

The loneliness lurked at the edges of her heart and she took a steadying breath.

Either way, it made sense to go back to her apartment first, didn’t it? She’d put on a warmer jacket and pants, and if they weren’t there… No matter.

She’d find them. She’d have her little family back. She wouldn’t be lonely.（语气是？）

孤独在她内心的角落蠢蠢欲动，她稳稳地吸了一口气。

不论怎样，第一步是回到公寓，这是最合理的。她得换身暖和点的夹克和裤子，要是他们不在那里……也没关系。

她会找到他们的。她必须要找回她的小家庭。这样她才不会孤单。

~

Shinji awoke for the second morning in a row entangled in Asuka’s limbs. This time, though, she was naked and so was he.

Memories of the previous night came flooding back and he smiled, half in amazement, half in sorrow, at what they’d done. In response to his thoughts (no, that’s impossible, he reminded himself), she drew closer to him, nuzzling her face into his neck. Her lips found his throat and she suckled gently at the tender flesh.

She murmured something now, in her sleep, sighing.

又是一个早晨，真嗣醒来，发现明日香的手脚缠着自己。不过，这一次，她是裸着的，他也是。

前一天晚上的记忆如洪水般袭卷而至，想起他们所做的事，他微笑起来，半是惊奇，半是忧郁。在他的回想里（这不可能真的发生了，他提醒自己），她靠紧他，将脸蛋蹭在他的颈部，她的嘴唇亲吻他的喉咙，温柔地吮吸着娇嫩的皮肤。

仍然熟睡的她在小声咕哝着什么。

“笨蛋。”

“Idiot.”

Well, some things would never change, he supposed. He started to get up—really just a gently tremor in his limbs—and then gave up. What did it matter? They didn’t have to go to school. They didn’t have to be at NERV for tests. They didn’t have to pilot the EVAs. They didn’t have to do anything.

They were free. A kind of free neither of them had ever experienced. Where the only shackles left were invisible. Ensnared by their own dark hearts and the cloying guilt and bitterness that infused every look, every kiss, every touch.

好吧，有些事是不会改变的，他想。他想试着坐起来——真的只是稍微挪一下——然后就放弃了。有什么要紧呢？他们又不用去上学。也不用去NERV进行什么测试，更不用去驾驶EVA了。他们什么都不用做。

他们自由了。这是一种他们两个人都不曾体会过的自由。唯一的枷锁是看不见摸不着的。他们被自己的黑暗闭锁的心灵所俘获，用令人厌烦的愧疚感和苦涩之情注入进他们每一次的对视，每一个接吻和爱抚之中。

He wasn’t sure if this was right. If she liked this. If he liked this. But he felt like they had no choice but to cling together in the face of the loneliness, the coldness. They could share their warmth or die.

他不确定这么做是不是对的。她喜欢这样吗？他喜欢这样吗？但是在冰冷与孤独的环抱之下，他们别无选择，只能依偎在一起，互相取暖，不然就活不下去。

Was this love? To have a heart so intertwined with someone else’s? He imagined the strings of his life interwoven with hers. No, not the strings but the veins and arteries of his heart beating in time with hers, regardless of whether they wanted it or not. Was it love? Maybe. But a love unlike the ones he saw on TV or read about in manga. There were no cherry blossoms fluttering about them in the spring, no sparkles or longing looks. No pivotal confession of heart-felt feelings. Instead, they had something darker, crueler, but, he suspected, stronger. Something that would never let them go, no matter what they did. No matter how they hurt each other.

让心灵如此紧密地与另一人纠缠，这就是爱吗？他想象着命运的红线与她缠绕的样子。不，不是线绳，而是心腔内外与她同步收张的动静脉，无论他们是否愿意，这已然成既定事实。这就是爱吗？也许。但是这和他在电视上或者漫画里看到的迥然不同。没有盛放的樱花点缀在他们四周，没有激荡的火花和深情的凝望。没有真情流露的热烈告白。他们所体验到的，是更黑暗，更无情的东西，但他猜测，也是更强烈的。这是一种跃过他们的所作所为，逼迫他们在一起的东西。无论他们如何相互伤害，也不肯放过他们。

Did he like her? Did he even like her? If he’d had the choice of any girl in the world, if he’d been unburdened by his own unforgivable sins, would he have picked her? Of course, she was beautiful. That went without saying. Even when she was fully clothed, her beauty embarrassed him: she could pack more into a single look than most people could communicate in an entire evening. Her eyes, her face, the curve of her neck, hair the color of flames.

他喜欢她吗？他真的喜欢过她吗？如果在这世界，他有别的女孩可以选择，如果他可以脱去这无法饶恕的罪恶，他还会选择她吗？的确，她是漂亮的。这点毫无疑问。甚至她穿衣服的时候，她的美丽也令他神不守舍：她一个眼神能传递的内容比大部分人一晚上所表达得还要多。她的眼，她的脸蛋，她脖颈的线条，焰火般的发色。

She was cruel. But so was he. He’d violated her. But she’d violated him. She was broken, but so was he, and they’d shattered along similar lines. He saw them, in his mind’s eye, as two porcelain dolls, with nearly identical cracks. This meant, though, that you could slide a chunk of Shinji out and into Asuka and repair his cracks with her.

她是卑鄙的，他也是。他曾侵犯她。但她也侵犯了他。她的心是支离破碎的，他也是，他们受伤的轨迹几乎吻合。他用心眼看见了两个瓷娃娃，有着几乎完全一致的裂痕。这就意味着，如果你把真嗣娃娃铲掉一块，嵌到明日香娃娃上，刚好就能修补对方的缺损。

Somehow, he liked being with her. He liked her teasing. He liked that she refused his passivity. That she pushed him until he spoke, until he reacted.

He felt most human with her. How was it that there was no word for this feeling triangulated somewhere between love and hate but stronger than both combined?

Shinji shifted and Asuka’s body moved with him. Her eyes fluttered open and found his.

不知为何，他就是喜欢和她待在一块儿。他喜欢她取笑自己。他喜欢她不认可自己的被动和无所作为。她会使劲推他，直到他开口抗议，直到他采取行动。

和她在一起，他觉得自己最像个人类。为何没有一个词可以形容这种并非爱与恨单纯相加，而是在两者所支起的三角轴之上的更为强烈的情感？（-这句话好难啊！！triangulated，是不是要意译才好）

真嗣动了一下，明日香的身子也跟着他挪位。她缓缓眨了眨眼睛，对上他的。

Good morning, she mouthed.

Good morning, he mouthed back. Her lips hung open for a second and he received the invitation hungrily. She made a pleased sound when they broke apart.

“Have you ever,” she asked softly. “Slept so well that you thought you were only dreaming of sleep? Because you’ve always had nightmares and not having them feels like a dream?”

He shook his head.

早上好，她用唇语说道。

早上好，他也用同样的方式回应。她的嘴唇微启，静静地张了一秒，他随即饥渴地接受了邀请。当他们分开时，她发出了满意的声音。

“你以前有没有，”她温柔地问，“睡过这么香甜的觉，甚至以为梦见了自己在睡觉？因为你一直一直地做噩梦，所以当噩梦不见的时候，感觉就像在做梦？”

他摇头。

“Well,” she said with a throaty sigh, settling her head back on his chest. “That’s where I’m at.”

He slid his fingers through her hair and she writhed, cat-like, into his palm.

“But don’t let it go to your head, idiot,” she added. “This might be a one-time thing.”

“好吧，”她干涩地叹了口气，脑袋安贴在他的胸口，“我就是这样的。”

他的手指滑入她的发丝，她像只猫咪似的冲他的掌心扭了扭身子。（-我永远也翻不出这种可爱的感觉QAQ）

“别精虫上脑了，笨蛋，”她补充道，“这可能只会发生一次。”

Shinji must have made a face because the haughty look on hers faltered.

“Don’t give me that. Maybe not. Probably not, if you play your cards right. But don’t think this means anything it doesn’t.”

真嗣肯定露出了什么鬼脸，因为她脸上调皮的神情不见了。

“省了这招吧。也许还有第二次。很可能还有，只要你出对了手里的牌。但不要以为这件事就算达成了某种关系，其实并没有。”

“What does it mean, then?” he asked, carefully. She averted her gaze.

“Um, why don’t you tell me what you think it means and I’ll tell you if you have it right? Okay?” she asked in a small voice that somehow sounded very far away. Was she blushing? The flesh of her cheeks had definitely turned red.

“那么，它意味着什么呢？”他问得十分小心。她移开目光。

“嗯，为什么你不先告诉我你觉得它意味着什么，然后我来回答你说的对不对，怎么样？”她用一种细微到好像很遥远的声音说。她在害羞？她的脸颊明显变红了。

Shinji opened and closed his mouth a few times—how, exactly, would he explain this theory about something that isn’t exactly love and isn’t exactly hate, but which would bind them together even more powerfully than either and could tip either way, like a see-saw at a park?

真嗣张口又闭口，持续了好几回——他应该，怎样确切地解释这个说法，既不完全是爱情，也不完全是仇恨，而是一种较前两者而言，把他们更强有力地结合在一起的东西，而且还可以随时偏激，就像公园里的跷跷板？

The door to the apartment clattered open. A tired voice spoke into the silence: “I’m home.”

Asuka’s head whipped back around to his. Misato, they both mouthed.

公寓的门吱嘎一声打开了。一个疲惫的声音传入了安静的房间。“我回来了。”

明日香的脑袋刷地转向他。美里，他们同时向对方用唇语说出这个名字。

~

It was nearly noon and the place was empty. Standing in the doorway, she felt the sad smile tugging at the corners of her lips. The kitchen was surprisingly clean, but she supposed Shinji must have cleaned it that morning or maybe the evening before. She drifted to the fridge and started to reach for it when she heard the tumult of flesh and fabric in one of the other rooms.

时间快要中午了，这地方了无人迹。站在门廊里，她感觉嘴角扯出了一丝悲伤的笑容。厨房令人吃惊地干净，但她猜肯定是真嗣在上次某个早晨或者晚上清理干净的。她缓慢地走到冰箱边，正要打开冰箱门的时候，她听见另一个房间里传来了身体和衣服摩擦的骚乱感。

Don’t get your hopes up, she tried to tell herself. Maybe it’s—someone else. Maybe it’s a stray dog. Maybe it’s—

She knocked at Shinji’s door. She heard angry whispering and then a throat being cleared.

希望越大，失望越大，她试图劝说自己。也许——那是别的什么人。也许是条流浪狗。也许是——

她敲了真嗣的房门。她听见了愠怒的低语，还有一声清嗓子的咳嗽。

“Um, just a second,” Shinji’s hoarse voice called back. Misato took a step away from the door, covering her face with her hands, trying to catch the tears before they started falling.

“唔，等一下下。”真嗣沙哑的声音传了出来。美里后退一步，双手捂住了脸，想要接住差点流下来的眼泪。

A second later, the door whipped open and there they both were: red, disheveled, clad in a confusing array of mismatched clothes fit for different seasons. Asuka’s hair was a tangled mess and Shinji’s wasn’t much better. The three stared at each other for several moments, taking each other in.

Missato’s eyes drifted from their faces—shocked, flushed, and scarred in Asuka’s case—to their hands. They were holding hands. The two teens followed her gaze, found their hands, and looked at one another, before turning back to Misato.

一忽儿，门被飞快打开，两个人都出现了：面红耳赤，衣冠不整，从上到下令人困惑地依次混搭着不同季节的衣物。明日香的头发是一团盘结的乱麻，真嗣的也没好到哪儿去。

美里的眼睛从他们的脸庞——震惊的、带着红晕的脸，明日香还带着受伤的表情——到了他们的手。他们手拉着手。这俩小年轻跟随着她的视线，看见他们的手，然后面面相觑，又转回到美里。

Shinji’s mouth stretched into a soft smile.

“Um, welcome home,” he whispered.

Asuka was not so subtle. She wormed her arm tight around Shinji’s waist, gripped him to her as she all but shouted: “Welcome home!”

真嗣的嘴巴挤出一个和蔼的笑容。

“呃，欢迎回来，”他嘘声说。

明日香可没那么唯诺。她伸手用力缠住真嗣的腰，把他牢牢挟在自己身边，几乎是大声地喊道：“欢迎回来！”

~

Misato’s return couldn’t have come at a worse time, Asuka had decided. If there was one person in all of existence who could distract Shinji from her and derail whatever they were figuring out together—it was Rei. But if there were a second person who could manage that…

明日香赌气地想着，美里真是挑了个不能更讨厌的时机回来。如果非要从全人类中挑出一个能分真嗣的心，打乱他们好不容易创造的局面的人——那必定是丽。但是如果要说有第二个人也能做到这种事，那必定会是……

In a flash, Asuka chose her strategy. It was bold, and she knew it would confuse Shinji, but she knew he’d go along with her lead until she had a chance to explain to him.

“Sorry you had to see us like this,” Asuka giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. “Honestly, since we woke up, we haven’t been able to keep our hands off each other.”

电光火石之间，明日香选择了她的策略。这是个很大胆的做法，她知道真嗣会很困惑，但她也知道他会附从她的指挥，直到她有机会向他解释。

“对不起喔，让你看见我们这个样子，”明日香咯咯笑着说，一只手捂住了嘴，“实话实说，从早上醒来开始，我们的手就没有放开过对方呢。”

They sat around the dining room table as they had for so many awkward meals in the past. Shinji’s ears perked up at this detail but he said nothing to discredit her. His back was turned to them as he cooked, and she knew from the slump of his shoulders that he was confused. This was fine, but she would need more than silence to work up a convincing simulacrum of intimacy and happiness.

他们坐在餐桌边，就如从前数不清次数的尴尬饭局一样。听到明日香的细节描述，真嗣的耳朵弹了一下，但他没说什么让她掉面子的话。他背对着他们做饭，她可以从他垂落的肩膀判断他在困惑之中。这倒不要紧，但比起沉默是金，她需要他的言语来使这亲密和喜悦感更加可信，而不是捕风捉影。

“Isn’t that right, Shinji?” she cooed, laying extra honey on his name. She prayed he’d hear the threat worked into the syllables, and it seemed he did because he played his part just fine.

“Oh, don’t tell Misato that,” he chuckled. “It’s embarrassing! She doesn’t want to know all that.”

“不是这么回事吗，真嗣？”她在他的名字上用了更甜蜜的语气。她祈祷他听见了音节下面有意暗藏的威胁，他应该是听懂了，因为他演得恰到好处。

“哦，别告诉美里小姐这件事。”他轻笑道，“太尴尬了！她肯定不会想知道全部的。”

Well done, Shinji, she beamed silently into his brain. She giggled and covered her face.

“You two,” Misato sighed in obvious delight. “You know, I always hoped you two would get together. I knew you had chemistry. I could tell, right from the very beginning.”

干得好，真嗣，她的微笑进入了他的脑电波。她咯咯地笑着，以手掩面。

“你们两个，”美里高兴地叹气，“你们知道，我一直希望你们两个能成。我知道你们之间有那什么关系。甚至可以说，打从一开始就是如此。”

Shinji laughed a little too loud. “From the very beginning, huh?”

“You two dancing together—it was just about the cutest thing. I think I have a few videos of your practice sessions. We should watch them. It’ll be just like old times.”

真嗣笑得有点过于响亮了。“从最开始么，嗯？”

“你们一起跳舞——那是最可爱的画面了。我想我还存了几个你们练习的录像片段。我们应该回顾回顾，重温一下过去的美好时光。”

“Oh, how fun!” Asuka squealed. Shinji glanced over his shoulder. Too much. Tone it down. Roger that. He wasn’t a bad partner in this. “I mean, it’ll be silly but there’s nothing else to do, is there?”

“喔，会很有趣吧！”明日香尖叫道。真嗣往后瞥了一眼。太夸张了。小点声。收到收到。看来他也不是个差劲的陪演。“我的意思是，看录像带这种事是有点傻，但是现在也没别的事可做，对吧？”

Misato leaned back, exhaling slowly. “You’re right. You’re totally right. Until more people wake up… We can kind of relax, can’t we? I mean, we’ve got shelter. The electric grid is still operational. Water is fine. All that stuff is totally automated and it’ll be fine indefinitely until something needs maintenance but hopefully, we’ll have a few more specialists on hand by that point.” Here, again, was the policy wonk-administrator-tactician who had defeated Angel after Angel. Who worked twenty-hour days and drank herself into a stupor and still managed to outsmart alien intelligences time and time again. Who’d given her life trying to save Asuka. “We won’t have a lot of fresh produce for the foreseeable future, unless either of you want to take up farming—but it’s getting cold, so there’s not much chance of that for a few months, assuming our seasons have reverted to how they were when I was a kid. But the stores around here have plenty of frozen food, it looks like, and we can just take what we want.”（-缓翻）

美里往后倾身，慢悠悠地吸了一口气。“你是对的。一点不错。直到更多人醒来之前……我们可以轻省些，不是吗？我的意思是，我们有个避难所。电网也还在运作。水也供得上。”“在可预见的未来，很快就不会有太多新鲜食物了，除非你们愿意开垦农田——不过天气要转冷，考虑到我小时候那天气变化，再过几个月就没机会了。但是这附近的商店还有很多冷冻食物，看起来，我们可以随意取用想要的。”

“Exactly! That’s what we’ve been doing. In fact, Shinji made me schnitzel last night with some frozen pork cutlets he found.” Misato beamed at them, all but shaking in delight.

“You guys—are—the—cutest!” she squealed. “I can’t stand it! You two are so sweet! I’m so happy for you two. Really.” She reached back to tug Shinji’s shirt. “You saved her out there, didn’t you? I knew it. I knew you’d come through in the end. I knew you’d be a big ol’ hero and save her.”

“没错！这就是我们在做的事。实际上，真嗣用了他找到的冷冻猪肉给我做了炸猪排。”美里绽开笑容，几乎要兴奋得颤抖。

“你们俩——是——最可爱的——！”她尖叫，“我受不了啦！你们也太甜了！我真为你们感到高兴，真的。”她扯了扯真嗣的衬衫。“你那时候救到她了，对吧？我就知道。我知道你最后会成功的。我知道你是个能救心爱女人的无敌大英雄。”

Asuka watched the blood drain from Shinji’s face. He glanced back at her and she narrowed her eyes.

“That’s right,” he said with a steady exhale. “It was a hard fight.”

明日香见到真嗣的脸上血色褪去，他朝她瞥了一眼，她眯起了眼睛。

“没错，”他稳稳地呼吸着，“那是一场很艰难的战斗。”

“But that’s when I knew that Shinji was the only man for me,” Asuka chimed in, quickly. She hoped it wasn’t too quick. “The other EVAs messed me up pretty badly but Shinji saved me in the end.” She licked her lips. How to explain the scars? “They left a lot of bad wounds, though. It’s sad but, uh—I died in his arms.”

Misato’s eyes widened. “Seriously? Asuka!” She took the girl’s hands.

“但那个时候我才发现真嗣是我的真命天子，”明日香插嘴道。她希望没有太急切，“EVA量产机把我打得半死，真嗣最后救了我。”她舔了舔嘴唇。怎么解释伤疤呢？“那些家伙把我弄得一身伤。说来难过但是，呃——我在他的怀里死去了。”

美里的眼睛睁得大大的。“认真的吗？明日香！”她握住了女孩的手。

“Yeah. But he kissed me and held me tight. He told me he’d follow me to heaven or hell or whatever I went, and he’d bring me back. And then I woke up in the pool with everyone else, so it was okay. And then we woke up later and—here we are.”

“Just like Sleeping Beauty!”

“嗯。但是他亲了我，紧紧地抱住了我。他说无论我是上天堂还是下地狱都会把我带回来。然后嘛我在那个LCL池子里和其他人类一起醒来了。然后嘛我们两个都苏醒过来——我们就在这里了。”

“就像睡美人的故事！”

“Yeah,” Shinji murmured, setting plates down in front of them before joining them. “Something like that.”

“So, what have you two been up to? Besides,” and here Misato winked. “You know. I won’t ask too many questions—I saw the medicine in the bathroom. You two really have been going at it. Try not to have too many slip ups like that. At least not until we’ve got a doctor or two around.”

“是啊，”真嗣嘀咕，把餐盘放在他们桌前，加入了他们，“差不多是这回事吧。”

“所以，是什么让你们进展到那一步的？对了，”美里使了个眼色，“你们知道哦。我不会问太多问题——我看到盥洗室里的药。你们真的已经到那种程度了。不过别犯太多次那种错误。至少也要等我们有了医生再说。”

“Ah, I’m so embarrassed I left that out!” Asuka gasped. Of course, she wasn’t embarrassed in the slightest. She was simply relieved: Misato had supplied an explanation for the medication that didn’t come near the truth and that’s all she needed.

“We’ve been going on a lot of walks,” Shinji added. “And we found a bar we like.”

Misato’s smile wavered. “Um, a bar?”

“It’s fun,” Asuka said. Good work, idiot—let’s get Misato talking about something she likes. “Shinji found a book of cocktail recipes and we started going through them alphabetically. We go, like, every night.”

“啊，不小心把药忘在那里了，好尴尬！”明日香倒吸气。当然咯，她不可能有一丝一毫的尴尬之情。她只是松了口气：美里已经由避孕药自发想到了避开正确答案的解释，那正是她想要的。

“我们谈了很久的话，”真嗣补充道，“我们还找到了一家喜欢的酒吧。”

美里的笑容动摇了一下。“呃，酒吧？”

“很有趣的。”明日香说。好主意啊，笨蛋真嗣——让我们把话题引到美里喜欢的地方去。“真嗣找到了一张鸡尾酒点单，我们开始按照头一个字母的顺序依次品尝。我们的话，每晚都会去。”

As soon as she spoke, Asuka realized she’d overplayed her hand. Misato stared at them.

“You guys are kind of young for that.”

“You drink all the time,” Asuka growled, the cheery mask slipping. “I saw you eyeing the beer in the fridge when Shinji was cooking.”

“Well, that’s different,” Misato said with a wave of her hand. “I’m an adult.”

“We do other—adult—things.”

当她这么说的时候，她意识到自己有点过于耍聪明了。美里严肃地盯着他们。

“对你们来说还太早了。”

“你一刻不停地喝，”明日香说，高兴的伪装正在滑落，“真嗣在做饭的时候，我见你的眼睛时不时瞥一眼冰箱里的啤酒。”

“嘿，那不一样，”美里挥了挥手，说，“我是个成年人。”

“我们做了别的——成年人该做的事。”

“But those things can’t really hurt you if you’re careful,” Misato said, picking her words carefully. “But drinking is…” And here she sighed. “You’re right. I’m not really the one to give you two advice. I haven’t been the best role model.”

“Come with us to the bar, and you’ll see how fun it is!” Asuka redonned the façade, and she was determined there’d be no cracks this time. She caught Shinji’s eye and he looked away. Fine. As long as he didn’t say anything to make her suspicious.

“Maybe. Maybe.” Misato sighed and smiled. “I guess—having a little party to celebrate all of us being together again makes sense.”

“但如果你足够小心，那些事情不会真的伤害你，”美里谨慎地遣词造句，“但是喝酒……”她叹了口气，“你是对的。我不是给你们提供意见的人选。我从来都不是最佳榜样。”

“跟我们一起去酒吧，你就知道那多有趣了！”明日香重新恢复之前的形象，她决心这次要做到完美无缺。她对上真嗣的视线，对方移开了。行吧。只要他不说别的什么让她变得可疑就行。

“也许。也许吧。”美里叹气，然后微笑，“我猜——庆祝我们三人都活下来，开个小派对也挺不错的。”

“Exactly! A party!” Asuka giggled. “Shinji, doesn’t that sound fun? You’ll make food and cocktails?”

“Of course,” he stuttered. Look a little bit more excited, idiot, she thought.

“But only if I can manage to keep my hands off you for long enough,” she added.

If Misato noticed a disconnect between Shinji’s dimmed eyes and Asuka’s feather-light giggles, she said nothing about it. Instead, she relented and slid over to the fridge, selected a beer, and cracked it open with a satisfying hiss.

“You guys,” she whispered into the foam.

“正是如此！一个派对！”明日香笑了，“真嗣，这听上去不有趣吗？你会把饭和鸡尾酒做好的对吧？”

“当然了，”他结巴地说。表现得更开心一点啊，笨蛋，她心想。

“但前提是我得忍住一段时间不缠着你。”她补充道。

就算美里注意到了真嗣黯淡的眼神和明日香假装的笑声之间的脱节，她也没说出来，而是溜到冰箱边上，选了一灌啤酒，撬开，畅饮并发出一声满意的嘶声。

“你们俩啊……”她对着泡沫轻声说。

“Asuka,” he said as soon as they stepped into the elevator. “What was that?”

“Listen, idiot,” she grunted and slammed his shoulders against the wall. She found herself surprised for a moment—where had that come from? Whatever. It just meant she was feeling stronger. More like herself. “Misato doesn’t know what happened. I don’t know if she didn’t see everything in the soup, or if she forgot or what, but I don’t care. We can’t let her know about—what you did. And didn’t do.”

He wouldn’t meet her eyes.

“Why not? I don’t want to lie.”

“明日香，”他们一走进电梯，他就说，“那是怎么回事？”

“听着，笨瓜，”她嘟囔道，按着他的肩膀把他推到墙边。她还自觉惊讶——这股力气是从哪儿来的？不管怎样，这意味着她变得更强壮了。更像原本的自己了。“美里不知道发生了什么事。我不知道她在那锅汤里能不能看到一切，或是她自己忘了，总之不管。我们不能让她知道——关于你做的事，和你没做的。”

他不肯看她的眼。

“为什么不呢？我不想撒谎。”

“Because! It would hurt her, idiot! She thinks she died to save us! Do you want to take that away from her? And look at how excited she is to be back here! She thinks we’re in love and that makes her happy and it would be cruel if she found out the truth.”

“And what’s the truth?”

“Don’t start with that again.”

“Asuka, I—“

She tightened her grip on his shoulders.

“因为！那会伤害她，笨蛋！她认为她的死换来了我们！你想要让她扫兴吗？看看她回来以后是多么兴奋！她觉得我们相爱了，所以开心得不得了，如果让她发现了真相也太残忍了吧。”

“那什么是真相？”

“别又开始了。”

“明日香，我——”

她收紧了抓着他肩膀的手。

“Say it, idiot,” she whispered. Her stomach was doing nervous flips. The elevator reached the ground level and dinged. They stood like that, his eyes on the floor, as the door opened, and then closed exactly seven seconds later.

“Coward,” she muttered after another minute.

“再说一次，笨蛋，”她低声说。她的胃紧张地翻动。电梯到了最底层，发出“叮”的一声。门打开的时候，他们还像那样站着，他的眼睛盯着地面，于是几秒钟后，门又关闭了。

“胆小鬼。”一分钟之后，她喃喃道。

“Why do you care about her feelings?” he asked later, when they were shopping. She all but jumped when she heard his voice. They’d been silent on the walk over and had, wordlessly, been grabbing things off the grocery shelves. Their selection was a random mix of frozen things, dried ingredients, and candies. At one point, Shinji had tried to edit their cart down into a menu that made sense together, but Asuka merely retrieved the things he’d tried to set back on the shelves. “You never did before.”

“Maybe I’m trying to be nice.”

“I’ll believe it when I see it.”

“为什么你要在意她的感受？”之后他们在购物的时候，他问道。她听见他的声音差点没吓一跳。一路走来的时候，他们都一言不发，从货架上拿东西也没有交谈。他们选了一些冷冻的食物，干燥的配料，还有糖果。有那么一刻，真嗣试图把这些食物变成一个有意义的菜单，但明日香只是把它们全都放回去。

“你以前都不是那样的。”

“也许我想表现更好。”

“只有我亲眼看到我才相信。”

“Do you like these too?” she asked, holding up a package of frozen dumplings. He nodded and she tossed them into the cart. “I don’t want her to pity me. I already have to deal with your pity. I couldn’t stand hers.”

“How do I pity you?” His voice rose. “And even if I did, why would that be so wrong? We’ve both had terrible lives.”

“Because it’s rude!” she screamed, her voice echoing in the empty store. “It’s rude and it means you think I’m weak!”

“Maybe,” he said, turning away. “You are weak.”

“你也喜欢这些吗？”她问，拾起一包冰冻饺子。他点头，她把饺子扔进购物车里。“我不想她同情我。我已经受够了应付你的同情。我不能再忍受她的。”

“我怎么就同情你了？”他的声音提高了，“即使我那么做，为什么就错了呢？我们都有同样糟糕的生活。”

“因为那很没礼貌！”她叫道，声音回荡在空荡的商店里，“不仅没礼貌，而且还意味着你觉得我很脆弱！”

“也许，”他把头扭了过去，“你是很脆弱。”

Asuka’s fingers dug hard into the package of edamame she had been examining. “Say that again.”

“Maybe you are weak. So what? We’re all weak. Maybe you’ll just have to accept you’re not that special. That you’re just like me.”

“How am I like you?”

“You’re afraid.”

“No, I’m not.”

“Of me.”

明日香正在检查一包日本毛豆的质量，听到这话，她的手指深深嵌进了毛豆的包装里。“你再说一遍。”

“也许你是很脆弱。所以怎么了？我们都很脆弱。也许你只是需要接受自己没那么特别，接受你其实就和我一样。”

“我怎么和你一样了？”

“你在害怕。”

“不，我没有。”

“怕我。”

“I have a right to be afraid of you. After what you did.”

“But that’s not why you’re afraid. You’re afraid of—of—how I feel. And how you feel. I think.”

“And how’s that?”

“我会保留害怕你的权利。在你做的事情之后。”

“但那不是你害怕的原因。你害怕的是——是——我的心情。和你的心情。我是这样想的。”

“怎么解释？”

“You try to trap me into being the one to say it,” he yelled, hurling a bag of rice at the floor. It caught on something and tore open, spilling pearl white grains all over the jaundiced tile（-jaundiced，黄疸的，不明白这个词为什么形容砖地） floor. “Because you’re afraid to say it yourself. You want to know it’s a sure thing, before you let yourself feel it. Before you admit feeling it.”

“But you won’t say it either!” she said, a dry sob hurtling over her lips. She had been leaning against one of the glass doors in the frozen food aisle and now she slid down it, bowing her head. “You’re just as much of a coward as I am, so don’t act all high and mighty.”

“你想要引诱我做先说出它的那个人。”他喊道，把一包米甩在地上。它撞到了什么东西，裂开了，白色的谷粒撒在黄疸色的地砖上。“因为你害怕自己说出来。你想知道那是不是真的，在你允许你自己感受它之前，在你愿意承认它之前！”

“但你也不肯说啊！”一声干燥的抽泣掠过她的齿畔。她之前倚靠在冷冻食物区的一面玻璃门上，现在已经顺着滑到地上，头低垂着，“你跟我一样，都是十足的胆小鬼，所以别表现得高高在上。”

“What are we afraid of?”

“Rejection.”

“Pain.”

“Being alone.”

“That sounds right.”

“我们都害怕什么呢？”

“拒绝。”

“痛苦。”

“孤独。”

“听起来不错。”

He gave her his hand and after a second, she took it. She was in his arms again and even though the whole aisle was ice, she was warm.

“If someone pities me,” she whispered. “Then it’s like it was all for nothing. My whole life. Being… strong. Piloting an EVA.”

他朝她伸出了手，隔了一秒，她接受了。她又回到了他温暖的膀臂内，即使整个区都散发着寒气。

“如果有人同情我，”她小声说，“我就感觉我的努力都白费了。我的人生都白费了。变得……坚强也好，驾驶EVA也好。”

“Don’t you think,” he asked after a second. “There’s more to life than that? I mean, there are no more EVAs. Everything is easy for us, for now. You can relax, like Misato said.” He pressed his cheek to hers and she was surprised to find it damp.（-湿润的） “You can be weak.”

They kissed. She started to unbutton his shirt.

“Not here.”

“你不觉得，”过了一会他说，“我们的生命里有比那些更重要的事？我的意思是，已经没有EVA了。至少现在，生活不再刁难我们。你可以放松，就像美里小姐说的那样。”他的脸颊贴住了她的脸，她惊讶地发现他的脸是湿润的。“你可以露出脆弱的一面。”

他们接了吻。她开始解他的衣衫扣子。

“别在这里做。”

“Why not? You said yourself. We can do whatever we want.”

She kissed his chest. She hated his silence, so she bit one of his nipples（-乳头） until he yelped.

“This makes me feel less alone,” she whispered. “You’re still my slave, aren’t you?”

It took him long enough to answer that she started to feel nervous, but the reply finally came: “Of course. Forever, right?”

“为什么不呢？你自己说的。我们可以想怎样就怎样。”

她亲吻他的胸脯。她讨厌他一声不吭，所以她咬住他的乳头，直到他忍不住叫了一声。

“这样会让我少一点寂寞。”她小声说，“你还是我的奴隶，对吧？”

他的回答中间停了很久，久到她开始紧张了，最后回应终于来了：“当然。永远的约定，不是吗？”

“That’s right. This might be the last time we can for a few days, by the way. Because of the medication. I took it this morning.”

“There’s nowhere to lie down here.”

“We don’t need to lie down,” she told him, and began to work her jeans off.

“没错。说起来，这可能会是接下来几天内的最后一次了。因为那个避孕药。我早上吃的。”

“这里没地方可躺下来呀。”

“我们不需要躺着。”她告诉他，然后开始脱牛仔裤。

（-好家伙，随时随地做爱啊你们！）

“You guys were gone a while,” Misato laughed when they arrived home. Pen-Pen balanced on her lap, looking as if nothing had changed—as if the world hadn’t ended twice within the past fifteen years, as if alien gods hadn’t assaulted the Earth and reduced the entire human race to primordial goop. Misato was on her third beer, and had a selection of magazines and manga spread out before her—she didn’t seem concerned with the state of the planet either. “I was afraid something happened!”

“你们真是去了好久呐。”他们进门时美里笑道。Pen-Pen在她的大腿上端坐，看上去像是一切安然无恙，像是世界没有在过去十五年之内足足毁掉两次，像是外太空的神明没有入侵地球，把全人类化成一团原始的黏糊之物。美里已经在喝第三罐啤酒了，在她面前摊出了好几本杂志和漫画——她似乎也毫不关心地球目前的状况。“我还担心出了什么事呢！”

“We had to go to a few stores,” Shinji said before Asuka could come up with a good reply. “We decided to stock up a bit.” Asuka watched him shift his collar around to hide the lip-shaped bruise on his clavicle（-锁骨） and she bit her lip to keep from grinning too much.

“我们逛了好几家店。”在明日香想出个合适的答案之前真嗣抢着开口，“我们打算屯一点备用物资。”明日香看到他调整了一下衣领，不让他锁骨上的吻痕露出来，不由得咬住嘴唇，免得笑出声音。

~

Misato stopped dead outside the bar. The late autumn evening gloom had descended（-降临） and it was made even darker by the lonely streets. Somehow, this bar managed to make everything even blacker.

“This place? This is your bar? This shit-hole?”

美里在酒吧外面停住了。暮秋的夜色降临了，使空寂的街道变得更昏暗。不知为何，这间酒吧映衬得周边环境更暗了。

“这地方？就是你们说的酒吧？狗窝还差不多！”

“Oh, don’t knock it!” Asuka shushed. She’d held onto Shinji’s arm the entire way, and Misato briefly worried she might be cutting off circulation to the poor boy’s extremities（-四肢）. Still, he seemed happy enough and they whispered at each other, walking a few steps behind her. Of course, they were absolutely besotted（-沉迷的，爱得发狂） with one another. It’d be like this for a while, she wagered（-打赌）. Puppy love. But who cared? Maybe this way, they’d get at least a few years to be stupid kids. She wanted nothing more than that for them and in this weird way, in a way that resembled virtually（-实际上） no adolescence ever experienced during the course of human history, it looked like they might just get it.（-不知道这句怎么翻，先放着）

“喔，别那么扫兴！”明日香嘘声说。她一路上紧紧搂住真嗣的胳膊，美里片刻之间有想过她会不会把这可怜男孩的手臂整麻了。不过，她还是很高兴，他们在她几步之遥的地方亲昵细语。当然，他们现在就是爱得如痴如狂，她打赌这种状态还得持续好一段时间。小猫小狗的恋情。但谁管呢？也许通过这种方法，他们还能像两个傻傻的小孩子一样玩耍个几年。这完全满足了她对他们的期待，

She followed them into the bar and took a seat next to Asuka, with Shinji playing bartender（-酒侍）. The teens seemed unconcerned by the scattered mounds of（-一堆） clothing left behind by raptured bar patrons, but they gave Misato the willies（-心里发毛）.

“What’s on the menu tonight, Liebchen?”

“Um, let’s see—we had a caipirinha and a daiquiri last time, I think.”（-凯匹林纳鸡尾酒和代基里酒）

“All the sugar gave me an awful hangover.”

她跟着他们进入酒吧，挑了明日香边上的座位，真嗣则担任酒侍。少年和少女似乎对那些喝得正尽兴的酒客们留下的散落一地的衣物毫不在意，虽然美里看着心里直发毛。

“今晚轮到哪一种酒了，Liebchen（亲爱的）？”

“唔，让我看看——我们上次喝的是凯匹林纳鸡尾酒和代基里酒。”

“那些糖分多得让我第二天只想吐。”

“You’ve been going through the book alphabetically（-按字母顺序排列）,” Misato observed. “That’s—one way to do it.”

“The Aviation was still the best,” Asuka declared. “The Blood and Sand was the worst. And it looked like LCL. Seriously. Shinji can make you one.”

“I’ll pass. Shinji, can you just hand me a beer?”

“你俩毕竟是按照字母顺序来尝试的。”美里审视着，“所以不免喝到差劲的。”

“碧血黄沙是最烂的，看起来跟LCL没什么区别。我不开玩笑，让真嗣给你弄一杯看看。”

“我选择不要。真嗣，能给我一瓶啤酒吗？”

“Uh, sure. Asuka, there aren’t really any interesting cocktails that start with ‘E’—how about a French 75?”

Soon, they all had drinks. They raised them together, sipped, and Misato watched as Asuka all but drained her cocktail.

“Woah, slow down! That’s not how you’re supposed to drink a cocktail.”

“But it’s tasty.”

“呃，可以。明日香，我真的找不到E打头值得一尝的鸡尾酒——要不就跳到法兰西75吧？”

很快，他们都喝上了。他们一同举起酒杯，品尝起来，美里看着明日香几乎把她的鸡尾酒一饮而尽。

“哇哦，慢点喝！喝鸡尾酒不该这么快的！”

“但很好喝嘛。”

“But you’ll get drunk too fast and you’ll be a mess.”

“But that’s what you do.”

Misato forced herself to hold her gaze with Asuka.

“But I’m an adult. I have a bit more of a tolerance. And this is just beer.”

“Fine! Shinji, make me another and I’ll drink that one slow.”

“That’s—not how it works…” she started to say but Shinji was already fixing another cocktail. Well, what would it hurt?

“但如果喝太快，你很快就会醉成一滩烂泥。”

“那不就是你喜欢干的吗。”

美里强迫自己的眼神咬着明日香不放。

“但我可是成年人。我的酒量更好。而且这只是啤酒罢了。”

“行！真嗣，那再给我一杯，我这次喝得慢点。”

“我也不是指……这个意思……”她想说的时候真嗣早已倒了另一杯。行吧，多喝几杯又有何妨？

A few drinks later, Misato stopped caring what they were drinking. Vaguely（-迷糊地）, in the back of her mind, she knew she should try to be more of a guardian here, should try to protect them and teach them—something—but had she herself ever learned whatever lesson this was supposed to be?

“That’s the thing about Instrumentality,” she declared, raising another glass. “No beer. Who ever thought that was going to work? Seriously.”

Asuka laughed. A bit too loud. She was drunk too, though, Misato thought with a silly grin and leaned on the girl.

“I’m so glad we’re all back together. It’ll be just like before, but better. I promise.”

几杯下去，美里已经不管他们喝多喝少了。在大脑的某个角落，她迷迷糊糊地想着，她应该更像个监护人，保护他们，教导他们——什么的——但她自己学到的功课又有什么和现在搭得上边的？

“这可是人类补完计划啊。”她举起另一杯啤酒宣告道，“说真的，没啤酒，这怎么可能进行得下去嘛！”

明日香笑了。笑得过于大声。她也醉得不轻，美里想着，嘴边挂着傻乎乎地笑，靠在女孩的身上。

“我真高兴能和你们重新团聚在一起。就跟以前一样，还会比以前更好。我保证！”

She turned her glass around. The bubbles in the beer really did remind her of LCL. How had she never seen it before?

“So, what did you guys see? In there.”

“What?” they asked, in unison, two pairs of wide eyes turning to her.

她在空中晃了晃酒杯。啤酒里的泡泡让她想起了LCL，她以前怎么都没注意到呢？

“所以，你们俩看到了什么？在那个里头。”

“什么？”两张嘴异口同声地问，两只眼睛一同睁得大大的。

“I mean, when we were all part of that big… soul.” She laughed. “I know I saw you guys in there but I can’t really remember what I saw. It was pretty dramatic and embarrassing, right?” She was blushing. “You saw me and Kaji, right?”

“Um, maybe,” Shinji murmured. “I don’t really remember.”

“There was a lot,” Asuka added.

“我的意思是，当我们都变成了那个……灵魂共同体的时候，”她笑道，“我记得我看见你们了，但是我记不得看见了什么。特别戏剧化，又很羞耻的玩意，对吧？”她脸红了。“你们看见我和加持了，对吧？”

“呃，也许吧，”真嗣咕哝，“我不记得了。”

“太混乱了。”明日香说。

“You guys are sweet. Well, whatever you saw, just remember—I made some mistakes when I was a kid. So try to learn from them.”

“Being with Kaji was not a mistake,” Asuka growled suddenly. “It could never be.”

“Oh, I don’t mean that,” Misato giggled. “Just—spending a week in his bed. That’s not really responsible. But you can be silly when you’re young.” She sighed. “You two get a chance to be silly now. No more Angels. No more EVAs.”

“It already sounds boring,” Asuka sighed. “Even if NERV was awful.”

“你们两个真贴心。好吧，不管你们看到了什么，只要记住——我是小孩的时候，我也会犯错。你们可以从我的错误里多学点。”

“和加持在一起，可不是个错误。”明日香突然抱怨道，“不可能是错误。”

“噢，我不是说这个，”美里咯咯笑道，“只是——整整一周都和他在床上。这是不负责任的行为。不过你们趁年轻，可以多疯一点。”她叹道，“你们现在得到了疯的机会。没有使徒，也没有EVA了。”

“听起来够无聊。”明日香叹息，“虽然NERV也很糟糕。”

“Being a kid is supposed to be boring. You’re supposed to study hard and hate your parents and lose your mind from worrying about getting into university. You’re supposed to have crushes on people who’ll never love you back and try things and be disappointed when you suck at them. And then, you think back on it, and you wish you could go back and try it all over, and you know you can’t. But there’s something kind of bittersweet in it. That longing.”

“当个孩子就是很无聊的。你本就应该好好学习，痛恨你们的父母，为能否考上好大学的问题愁得不可开交。你们本就应该爱上那些从来不会爱你们的人，放手去爱，到手以后又失望不已。然而之后当你回想起这一切，开始希望能够穿越回去让一切重新来过，你就知道你已经办不到了。但那其中仍然有许些苦涩的甜蜜，将会持久地存在。”

They were watching her. God, what am I talking about?

“Sorry, I’m drunk,” she giggled. “NERV was awful, though. I’m—sorry. That I helped bring you two into it.”

“It wasn’t your fault,” Shinji said softly. “It was my dad. And SEELE.”

他们都看着她。上帝，我在讲什么呀？

“抱歉，我喝醉了，”她咯咯笑，“NERV是很糟啦。我——对不起你们。是我把你们俩搞进去的。”

“不是你的错。”真嗣温和地说，“是我爸，还有SEELE。”

“Mhm,” Misato murmured. “I’d like to get my hands on any of your dad’s notes. Files. Records. Whatever. I wonder if they survived. Maybe not at NERV but Fuyutsuki might have kept something off-site…”

“What’s the point?” Asuka grunted. “It’s over. They’re all gone.”

“People will want to know,” Misato said. “Eventually. When they start coming back. We might be the first but I bet there’ll be others soon. Like waking up from the party of the century—the millennium—with a wicked hangover and no idea what happened. The world will be different from now on but we get to take a few deep breaths right now before it changes even more.”

“嗯……”美里发着含糊不清的声音，“我可以找找你爸爸的日记。文件。记录啥的。我在想还有没有留下来的。也许不在NERV本部，冬月可能还保存着不为人知的……”

“有什么意义？”明日香抱怨道，“已经结束了。都是过去的事情了。”

“人们总是想弄明白，”美里说，“最终，当他们都回来的时候，他们会想知道发生了什么。我们可能是第一批，但我打赌肯定会有更多人醒来，就像从一场世纪的狂欢盛宴——千禧之年苏醒，他们的头脑依然被邪恶的宿醉感蒙裹着，摸不清究竟发生了什么。世界早已天翻地覆，但我们仍需多做几次深呼吸，时刻预备着它更进一步的变更。”

“What if I don’t want them to know what happened?” Asuka muttered. There was a dark look on her face.

“But it’s not just up to you! All of humanity was involved.”

“And they all saw into my soul! I don’t want to see any of them again!” she yelled suddenly. She flung her glass at the floor and Misato squeaked as it shattered.

“如果我不想让他们知道发生了什么呢？”明日香嘟囔道。她的表情很阴沉。

“但不是你能决定的！整个人类种族都被卷了进去。”

“所有人都把我的灵魂看了个精光！我不想再见到他们中的任何一个混账家伙！”她突然叫起来，把她的酒杯丢在地上，摔成了碎片，美里惊叫一声。

She was about to reprimand the girl when Shinji appeared behind her with a broom.

“Hey,” he whispered, and said something to her and she took his arm like a child grabbing a favorite toy. She wrapped it around her shoulders, placing herself in a sort of headlock and gripping his forearm. He kept whispering and she nuzzled her face against his shoulder.

“Sorry,” she said, finally. “I’m kind of drunk.”

她正要安抚女孩，真嗣却出现在她身后，拿着一把笤帚。

“嘿，”他轻声招呼，对她的姑娘说了什么，她握住他的手臂，就像一个孩子抓住了心爱的玩具，把它绕在自己的肩膀上，围巾一样地裹着自己，并紧紧抓着他的前臂。他继续低声说话，她扭着脑袋，脸埋进了他的肩头。

“对不起，”最后，她终于说，“我好像有点喝醉了。”

“It’s fine,” Misato said as Shinji let her go. He began to sweep up the glass and when he disappeared to throw it out, she whispered: “He really takes care of you.”

“Don’t say that.”

“Why? It’s sweet. It shows how much he likes you. And understands you.”

Her face flushed redder than even the French 75’s had managed. She bowed her head until Shinji came back and the look she gave him was veiled from Misato by her red tresses.

“没关系。”真嗣放开她的时候，美里说。他开始扫碎玻璃，去倒垃圾的时候，美里小声说：“他真的好好地照顾着你呢。”

“别这么说。”

“为什么？明明很甜蜜。说明他真的很爱你。而且理解你的想法。”

她的脸红得比法兰西75带来的效果还要更甚。她低着脑袋直到真嗣回来，美里给他的眼神被她的红色秀丽长发掩盖了。

“之前在这里发生了不小的矛盾，”真嗣说，“我们两个之间的。但是当我们醒来以后，我们好好地谈过了。”

“We had some intense moments, in there,” Shinji began. “The two of us. But we talked it out when we woke up.”

“I’m glad,” Misato said, and poured the rest of her beer into her glass.

“I don’t like people I don’t know being able to see into my soul,” Asuka murmured once more. “Or even people I know. I think a little privacy isn’t too much to ask.”

“Well, the good thing is that it’s so hard to focus on any one soul’s experiences—no one will remember what they saw. I mean, I barely remember anything from in there.” She thought for a second. “There was a train. And then our kitchen.”

Their heads whipped around to stare at her.

“And a hospital. But that’s all I remember. Just… places.”

“Yeah,” Shinji said after a few moments of thought. “Me too.”

“我很高兴，”美里说，把剩下的啤酒倒进她的杯子里。

“我不喜欢陌生人能看到我心里的所思所想。”明日香再次开口低语，“甚至包括我认识的人。我想保留一点点隐私应该不过分吧。”

“不过，好的事情是很难去专注于不同个体灵魂的经历——没有人会记得他们看见了什么。我的意思是，连我也不记得发生了什么。”她想了一秒钟，“嗯，那里有个火车，还有我们的厨房。”

他们的眼神齐刷刷地望向她。

“还有个医院。但这些就是我能记住的全部了。就只是……场所罢了。”

“是啊，”经过片刻的思考，真嗣说，“我也是如此。”

~

The next day, she was sick and not just from her hangover（宿醉）. The cramps had hit hard and she sent Shinji out early to find ibuprofen（布洛芬消炎药）. Between the ache in her skull and the ache in her gut, she barely had room to think. Instead, she stayed in bed till the late afternoon, wishing Shinji would come and hold her, and not finding a voice with which to call him.

第二天，她浑身难受，而且不只是因为宿醉。痉挛发作得很厉害，她让真嗣早早地出去找布洛芬消炎药。头骨和肠胃的疼痛轮番来袭，她几乎没有思考的时间。她在床上一直躺到下午，希望真嗣能来抱抱她，又发不出声音来叫他。

They’d slept next to one another, and in the dark anonymity of the quilt, she could draw close to him and pretend she was someone else, he was someone else, and only in that way, could she be honest and say the words to herself that she’d wanted to hear him say. She felt like some primal creature, marking her mate with her scent, or maybe the other way around—maybe their scent was one now. She found this thought awoke feelings in her chest that tickled in a pleasantly terrifying way.

他们挨着睡。在被窝下的无名黑暗里，她可以靠近他，假装她是另一个人，他是另一个人，只有这样，她才能诚实地对自己说那些她想听他说的话。她觉得自己就像某种原始的生物，用她的气味来标记她的伴侣，或者也许反过来说--也许他们的气味已经趋同了——这种想法以一种令人愉快的恐怖方式挠得她心里发痒。

Everything had moved so fast. But should she be surprised? After all, they’d known each other for so long. No, that wasn’t true either. They’d known each other for less than a year. But what they’d experienced together could fill a lifetime. She’d felt deep recesses（休会） of his soul—his literal soul—and he’d known her in virtually every way it was possible to know someone so who was to say this was moving too fast?

It scared her. How quickly she could lose her hatred for him. How quickly the hatred turned to… something else entirely.

She shouldn’t forgive him, just because she wanted his warmth. Just because he could be so kind to her that it gutted her（使她心碎，gut-掏空）. Just because he could dispel（驱散） loneliness with a touch or a look.

她被吓到了。她对他的憎恨消失得多么快啊。仇恨是多么迅速地转变成了......完全不同的东西。

她不应该轻易原谅他，只因为她想要他的温暖。只因为他能对她那么好，以至于让她心碎，肠子都掏空了。仅仅因为他可以用一个触摸或一个眼神来扫除她的孤独。

Anything he gave her, she reminded herself, could be taken away. The pain of loss, she knew, was worse than the pleasure of love. If her mother had taught her anything, it was this.

Still—

Maybe—

This would be—

Different. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt.

她提醒自己，他给她的任何东西都可以被再度夺走。她知道，失去的痛苦比爱的快乐更可怕。如果她母亲教会了她什么，那就是这个道理。

只是——

也许——

这一次会不一样。

也许这一次，她不会再受伤了。

There was a dark little flame in her chest that wouldn’t go out. It stoked itself on the pleasure of possessing him, and his kindness was kindling to the fire. No matter what she tried, how she reminded herself of how damned they both were, it refused to die. Pathetic. Utterly pathetic, she thought. But still: she couldn’t help, in her quiet moments, as she lay with him or watched him hum as he cooked for her, as he held her, as she clawed him and kissed him, leaving marks that would brand him as hers, she couldn’t help at these times but to draw inside her chest for a moment and hold the flame in her hands. It burned, certainly, but it was beautiful and it was spreading.（-这就是开头介绍，写得真美）

有一簇黑暗的小小火苗，在她的胸口潜伏不出。它趁着占有他的喜悦掇弄自己，他的温柔使它持续燃烧。无论有多少次她尝试，无论她如何提醒自己，他们两个多么糟糕不堪，它始终不肯熄灭。多可怜啊，多可悲，她心想。然而，某些时刻，她无法忍耐，当安静的时分，她依偎着他；当他为她做饭的时候听他哼歌，当他拥她入怀，当她擒吻着他，留下那标志着他属于她的印记，她忍不住会在心里描摹出火苗的样子，用双手捧住。当然很灼烫，但却是美丽的，而且还在蔓延。

It was late. I should get up, before they worry about me, she thought. The thought surprised her. They might worry about her. It was something she would have struggled to imagine once. Now, though, she believed it.

天色已晚。我应该起床了，在他们为我担心之前，她想道。这个想法让她吃惊。他们可能会担心她。这是她曾经难以想象的事情。但现在，她相信了。

~

“She’s really out of it, huh?” Misato asked him at lunch as he sat down.

“Yeah. The pills really bothered her stomach, she said. I guess it’s to be expected.”

“Right. It can’t be helped. It was sweet of you to go get her painkillers.” Misato winked at him. “And me. First hangover since coming back.”

“It was no problem. I had a headache too,” he chuckled, picking at his bowl. He couldn’t muster much of an appetite. Mostly, he prayed Misato wouldn’t ask him any questions he’d find hard to answer. Not about what had happened.

“她直接睡过去了，是不？”午饭时分，真嗣一坐下，美里就问他。

“嗯。她说那些药让她肚子很不舒服。我想这在情理之中。”

“是啊。派不上用处。你去给她找止痛药，真贴心啊。”美里朝真嗣使眼色。“还有我。回来以后”

“我也犯头疼。”他轻笑一声，举起碗。他没什么胃口。大多数时间他都在祈祷美里小姐不会问出让他犯难的问题。不要问发生了什么。

“Say, Shinji,” she murmured after a few minutes of quiet. “Remember what I said the last time I saw you?”

“Um,” he stammered, looking down at his plate. “When we, uh, kissed?”

Misato giggled. “Yeah. About the adult stuff that comes after that? I guess you’ll have to forget about that now.”

“I guess.”

“说起来，真嗣，”几分钟的安静后，她咕哝着说，“记得我上次见你，我对你说的话吗？”

“呃，”他结巴地说，低头看餐盘，“你……亲我的时候？”

美里咯咯笑道：“是啊，还有剩下的事情。我猜你必须忘掉这些。”

“我猜是的。”

“I can’t say I’m not at least a teeny-tiny bit jealous of Asuka,” she said, leaning back. “But I’m happy for you two. Really. If there’s anything I can do or anything you need—if you want me out of the apartment sometimes or—or even if you guys want a place to yourself—“

“我不能说我对明日香有那么一丁点的嫉妒。”她靠回椅子上说，“但我为你们两个高兴。如果有什么我能为你们俩做的——如果你们想让我有时离开公寓——或许你们想要完全清静的私人空间——”

“No!” He blushed. “I mean, it’s nice, all of us, living here. And there’s already stuff here and everything. All our things and food and everything.” He was sputtering and he hoped she couldn’t trace the anxiety and guilt in his voice. “I suppose we could take one of these empty apartments in the building but—“

“Why bother? Good. That’s kind of how I feel. I’m tired of being lonely. I didn’t think I’d miss you guys as much as I did. Even though we were all together, it didn’t feel like it, did it?”

“不是！”他脸红了，“我的意思是，我们三人都住在这里，挺好的。这里已经塞满了各种补给品。我们的日常所需，食物还有其他的。”他，他希望她不会察觉他声音里的惊慌和愧疚。“我想我们可以在这栋楼里找个空的公寓，但是——”

"何必呢？行吧。这就是我的感觉。我已经厌倦了孤独的生活。我没想到我会这么想念你们。尽管在补完里我们都融合了，但感觉并不喜欢，不是吗？" “No. I don’t think Instrumentality worked. Or maybe I did it wrong. But I didn’t feel calm or happy or loved or anything in there. Just—numb. A little sad. Scared. Bored. Lonely.”

“Exactly. Nothing too awful—“

Speak for yourself, Shinji retorted silently.

“—but is it worth giving up your individuality for? I don’t think so. Not for me, at least. Maybe there’s something wrong with me too.”

"嗯。我不认为人类补完计划起作用了。也可能是我弄错了。反正我在那里没有感觉到平静，或快乐，或被爱，或任何东西。只是-很麻木。有一点悲伤。害怕。无聊。孤独。"

"正是如此。没有什么太可怕的--"

说你自己吧，真嗣默默地反驳道。

"但那值得放弃自身的个性吗？我不这么认为。至少对我来说不是。也许我自己也有问题。"

She shifted again and winced.

“Is there something wrong?”

“Oh, it’s nothing, really. When I woke up, I had a big scab（疤） from where I got shot and it’s been throbbing. I should take a look at it, I guess. I don’t want it to get infected right now.”

她挪了挪姿势，缩了一下。

“有哪里不对吗？”

“哦，没事，真的没事。我醒来的时候，被枪击中的地方有一个很大的疤痕，刺疼刺疼的。我想我应该检查一下。我不想它现在被感染。”

Shinji nodded. “Asuka has some scars from—what happened.”

“She must be self-conscious about them.”

“Yeah, I think she definitely is.”

真嗣点点头。“那些事——让明日香留下了疤痕。”

“她对那些伤疤一定很有自觉。”

“是啊，我也认为她肯定有。”

“You need to be very supportive about that, you know. A girl’s body image is very fragile.（脆弱）” She touched the spot on her chest where Shinji knew an old, healed scar rested. “Ugly boys get pretty girls all the time. Just look at your mom and dad. No offense.”

“你需要给她精神上的支持。一个女孩对外表印象的自信是很脆弱的。”她碰了碰她的胸口，真嗣知道那里有一道愈合的旧疤痕。“懒蛤蟆总是能吃上天鹅肉。看看你爸妈的结合就知道了。无意冒犯。”

She winked and he grinned.

“But girls are conditioned to be self-conscious. It’s cruel, but that’s how it is. And you two are so young. You can never miss an opportunity to make her feel beautiful, okay? I wish… I’ll leave it there, actually.”

她使了个眼色，他会心一笑。

“但是女孩子被置于一种需要自尊自爱的状态。这很残酷，但就是事实。你们两个都还年轻。你决不能错过任何一个让她感觉自己很漂亮的机会，行吗？我希望……我不会再多说了。”（-翻到这里我愈发觉得作者是女性）

Shinji nodded. He felt he should say something, but the smile on Misato’s face assured him that nothing more was needed. She reached to toss her empty beer can in the trash but gave a small gasp.

“Yeah. I definitely need to do something about this stupid thing.”

“I dressed Asuka’s wounds. Do you want me to take a look at it?”

真嗣颔首。他觉得他应该说些什么，但美里脸上的笑容告诉他无需多言。她伸手把空瓶子丢进垃圾桶，呼吸又一滞。

“哎。我得好好地把这愚蠢的伤口料理一下了。”

“我处理过明日香的伤口。你想让我看看它吗？”

“Oh, man, Shinji, would you? Honestly, I’m such a baby about things like this. Ritsuko always made fun of me, but I go to pieces over a paper cut. Other people’s blood doesn’t do anything for me, but the sight of my own freaks me out（吓晕）.” She smiled, and he saw a drop of sweat slide down her temple. “Ever since the Second Impact.”

“喔，我的真嗣宝贝啊，你会吗？老实说，我对这种事超级没辙的。律子总是取笑我，但我真的是容易大惊小怪。他人的血完全不能唬到我，但我自己的血却能把我吓得半死。”她微笑，他看见她的额骨上淌下一滴汗。“自从二冲以来就是这样。”

“Are you warm?” he asked. She shrugged.

“I guess. It’s pretty hot in here, isn’t it?”

“We don’t have the heat on.”

He leaned over the table and felt her forehead.

“You’re burning up. Let me take a look at the scab?”

“你很热吗？”他问。她耸肩。

“我想是的。这里不是很热吗？”

“我们没开任何暖气。”

他探身到桌面上方，摸了摸她的额头。

“你都烫坏了。让我看看你的伤吧。”

They moved to the living room and Misato stripped her shirt off. Shinji found himself almost blushing at the sight—she wasn’t wearing a bra—but Misato crossed her arms a second later.

“Sorry. But it’s not like it’s anything you haven’t seen, huh?”

“Um, yeah. I guess.”

He knelt and peered close at the gnarled rupture（多节疙瘩） of flesh, ringed with red. He pressed it with his finger and she winced（畏缩）. A dribble of pale yellow pus（脓） slithered out.

“I think it’s infected,” he sighed. “I can go to the pharmacy（药店） and get antibiotics（抗生素）. In the meanwhile, I guess—I should drain it, probably? And clean it?”

“Right,” Misato nodded. She had bent her head back, so she stared at the ceiling. “If you can find a needle or something, you can sterilize（灭菌） it with the burner on the stove. Or anything sharp, really.” She sighed. “Can I stop thinking about it and just turn that part over to you?”

“You relax,” he said, voice soft. “I’ll get this cleaned up before you know it.”

他们移动到了客厅，美里脱掉了她的衬衫。真嗣发现自己差点没脸红——她没有穿胸罩——好在美里在一秒钟后立刻交叉抱胸。

"对不起。但这又不是什么你没见过的东西，嗯？"

"嗯，是啊。我想应该。"

他跪下来，靠近看了看那块参差不齐的伤痕裂口，红红的。他用手指按住它，然后把它放回原处。他用手指轻按了一下，她畏缩了。一滴淡黄色的脓液渗了出来。

"我想它被感染了，"他叹了口气。"我可以去药店买抗生素。我想我应该把脓液放掉，这样子？然后清洗它？"

"对。"美里点了点头。她向后弯脖子，盯着天花板看。"如果你能找到一根针或其他东西，你可以用炉子上的燃烧器来消毒。或任何尖锐的东西，都行。" 她叹了口气。"我可以不去想它，直接把这部分交给你吗？"

"你放轻松，"他说，声音很温柔。"我会在你意识到之前就把你的伤口清晰完毕。"

He couldn’t find a needle, but there was a small scalpel in a neglected NERV-issued first aid kit stashed under the sink in the bathroom. He held it to the burner’s blue flame until he was sure nothing could have survived it, and knelt between Misato’s knees

他找不到针头，但在浴室水槽下的一个被忽视的 NERV 配发的急救箱里有一把小手术刀。他把手术刀对着燃烧器的蓝色火焰，直到确定完全消毒，然后跪在美里的双膝之间

“Here I go,” he whispered, and Misato grabbed his free hand as he pierced the tangled mess of hardened flesh.

他低声说："来了。"美里抓住他的空手，因为他刺穿了纠缠在一起的硬肉。

It was over in moments. He cleaned her up, wiped down the area with an antiseptic（抗菌剂）, and wrapped her belly with medical tape, bracing gauze（纱布） against the wound.

手术很快就结束了。他为她清理伤口，用抗菌剂擦拭伤口，用医用胶带包扎腹部，用纱布固定伤口。抵住伤口。

Misato wiped her forehead and sighed, wincing once more as she tested the bandage, twisting in the chair.

“You’re a life-saver, Shinji. Seriously.”

“It’s the least I could do. You got this protecting me.”

“Consider the favor returned.”

美里擦了擦额头，叹了口气，在测试绷带时再次抽搐起来，在椅子上扭动着身体。

"你真是救命恩人，真嗣。真的。"

"这是我最起码能做的。是你保护了我

"就当我还你一个人情吧"

“I don’t think I could ever make up for everything you’ve done for me,” he said, suddenly. She leaned forward, seeing him kneel on the floor before her. He gripped the knees of his jeans and had squeezed his eyes shut.

“Are you—crying?”

He shook his head, but she could see he was lying.

"我想我永远无法弥补你为我所做的一切，"他突然说道。她向前倾身，看到他跪在她面前的地板上。他抓着牛仔裤的膝盖，紧闭着双眼。

"你在哭吗？"

他摇了摇头，但她看得出他在撒谎。

“Oh, Shinji, Shinji,” she cooed and swept him into her arms. She pressed his face to her neck. “It’s over now. It’s all over. We’re safe. You. Me. Asuka. We’re all safe. No one’s going to hurt us anymore.”

She guided her lips to his hair and that’s when she saw the door to his room slide open.

"哦，真嗣，真嗣，"她咕哝着把他拥入怀中。她把他的脸贴在自己的脖子上。"现在都结束了。一切都结束了。我们安全了。你。我 明日香 我们都安全了 再也不会有人伤害我们了"

她把嘴唇贴在他的头发上 这时她看到他房间的门被推开了

“What’s going on here?” Asuka asked.

Misato managed a smile.

“The gunshot wound on my belly is infected. Shinji was taking care of it for me and we were reminiscing about how it happened.”

"这是怎么回事？" 明日香问道。

美里勉强笑了笑。

"我腹部的枪伤感染了。真嗣正在帮我处理伤口，我们还在回忆当时的情况。"

“When you kissed him,” Asuka all but spat out.（啐道）

“Yeah, that’s right.” Misato’s voice sounded distant. “But you don’t need to worry. That’s in the past. It was nothing.”

“Then why are you naked?” she hissed and turned back to the bedroom. The door clattered as she slammed it shut.

Shinji sat back on his heels（站稳脚跟）, wiping his eyes.

“Sorry. Asuka is—a little possessive of me, I think.”

"当你吻他的时候，"明日香啐道。

"是啊，没错。" 美里的声音听起来很遥远。"不过你不用担心。那都是过去的事了。没什么大不了的。"

"那你为什么光着身子？"她嘶吼着转身回到卧室。她砰的一声关上了门。

真嗣坐在脚跟上（站稳脚跟），擦了擦眼睛。

"对不起。我想明日香对我有点占有欲。

“She’s a teenaged girl. Of course she is. She acted like this with Kaji and she wasn’t even in a relationship with him.” Misato sighed and lifted herself back to the chair. “Go and make sure she’s okay. I’ve survived this long. I can wait another hour or two for the antibiotics.”

"她还是个年轻女孩。 她就是这样。她甚至对没有和她谈过恋爱的加持也是这样的。" 美里叹了口气，重新坐回椅子上。"去确保她没事。我已经活了这么久了。我可以再等等抗生素一两个小时。"

“You’re sure?”

“Go. In retrospect（回溯往事）—we could have done this differently. We should have. Things are different now. I need to remember that. It’s my fault.”

The smile on her face was desperately sad, if only for how hard she was clearly trying to keep it from looking sad. Shinji wanted to cry again.

“Go.”

"你确定？"

"去吧。回溯往事--我们本可以采取不同的方式。我们应该这样做。现在情况不同了。我必须记住这一点。这是我的错。

她脸上的笑容让人感到绝望，如果只是因为她很努力地想让自己看起来不那么悲伤的话。真嗣又想哭了。

"去吧"

~

As she expected, he came to her, groveling（低声下气）, to apologize. She curled up in his bed, faced away from him, and when he put his arm on her, she threw it off.

不出她所料，他来到她身边，卑躬屈膝地向她道歉。她蜷缩在他的床上，面对着他，当他把胳膊搭在她身上时，她甩开了。

“You already broke the rule,” she growled after listening to his pathetic excuses for fifteen minutes. “Talked to another woman. I let it slide, because it’s Misato. But then I find her tits（奶子）all over you.”

"你已经违反规定了，"在听了他可悲的借口十五分钟后，她咆哮道。"你和另一个女人说话。因为是美里，我就没管。但后来我发现她的奶子都在你身上"。

“Asuka, you saw me crying. Do you think I was enjoying that?”

She turned over.

“Were you? Misato’s big tits. You think about them, don’t you? You’ve masturbated to them? Don’t lie to me. I’ll know.”（-233）

“That’s not the point.”

“That’s exactly the point.”

“I don’t know what you want me to be.”

“Mine. That’s all. It’s simple.”

“Then say that.”

“No. Say what you feel.”

"明日香 你看到我哭了 你觉得我很享受吗？"

她翻了个身

"你喜欢吗？美里的大奶子。 你想过它们，是吗？你对着它们自慰过吗？别骗我了 我会知道的。"（233）

"这不是重点"

"这正是重点"

"我不知道你想让我成为什么样的人"

"我的人。就这样 很简单"

"那就说出来"

"不，说出你自己的感觉"

“Would it make a difference?” She turned to face him. He had been crying, she saw, but she knew her face was dry. There was power in this. She distorted（扭曲） her voice: “’Oh, Shinji, I’m so in love with you. Please, let’s get married and go live in a fairy castle beyond the sea. I want to have babies with you. I just love you so much!’”

"这有什么区别吗？" 她转身面对他。她看到他一直在哭，但她知道她的脸是干的。这就是力量。她扭曲她的声音："'哦，真嗣，我好爱你。求你了，让我们结婚吧，去海边的童话城堡生活。我想和你生孩子。我太爱你了！'"

“I don’t want that.”

“Then what do you want?”

“For you to—be nice to me. Be honest with me.”

“You wouldn’t like that either,” she growled. They watched each other, animals locked in a cage together.

“Go ahead. You could strangle me now,” she whispered. “Run away with Misato. She’ll be everything you want.”

"我不想那样"

"那你想要什么？"

"希望你对我好一点。对我诚实一点"

"你也不会喜欢的，"她咆哮道。他们互相看着对方，就像被关在笼子里的动物。

"来吧。你现在可以掐死我，"她低声说。"然后和美里私奔吧 她会是你想要的一切。"

“What do you think I want?”

“A lover and a mother. I can barely be one of those.”

That did it. He collapsed into the desk chair near the bed, caught his face in his palm.

“I told you. Being trapped with me would be hell,” she whispered. “Go away. I don’t want to see you right now.”

He started to say something but the tears garbled（混淆） it.

“I know I’m being awful. But I don’t care. This is what you get for hurting me. And now you’ll leave like everyone else leaves.”

"你觉得我想要什么？"

"爱人和母亲。 我几乎不可能成为这样的人。"

就这样。 他倒在床边的办公椅上，用手掌捂住了脸。

"我告诉过你。 和我困在一起简直是地狱。"她低声说道。"走开吧。我现在不想见到你。"

他刚想说什么，但泪水把他的声音弄混淆了。

"我知道我很糟糕。但我不在乎。这就是你伤害我的报应。现在你要像其他人一样离开我。"

“I need to get medicine for Misato.”

“I know. Go.”

“You told me to go.”

“Go,” she hissed.

"我得去给美里拿药。"

"我知道。 去吧。"

"是你让我去的。"

"去吧，" 她嘶吼道。

He didn’t. He pushed her over. No, no, no, she thought. Don’t do this. His arms descended on her once more and she couldn’t fight it.

“I’m not leaving yet,” his voice, quavering, told her. “If this is what you need to hear—“

他没有走， 他把她推倒了。不，不，不，她想。别这样。 他的手臂再次向她伸来，她无法反抗。

"我还不会走，"他颤抖的声音告诉她。"如果这就是你想听的......"

And he whispered it in her ear. She shook in his arms as the tears burst. She said it back to him, and immediately regretted it, and then decided she didn’t regret it, and then decided she could both regret and not regret it.

他在她耳边低语。她在他的怀里颤抖着，泪水夺眶而出。她回过头来对他说了这句话，马上就后悔了，然后又觉得自己不后悔，接着又觉得自己既可以后悔，也可以不后悔。

He told her lots of things. Too many things to keep track of. Some theory about their hearts being tied up together or something. He drew a little diagram（示意图） on the wall before her eyes with his finger, as if these invisible marks would prove something. He kept drawing a triangle（三角形） and putting them at the top and he had all sorts of dumb ideas about what the other two corners were. But he held her attention, because he held her. He kept coming back to hold her, no matter how badly she tried to hurt him, and this had to be something. This had to be real. The dark flame had burned out of control and consumed her heart.

他告诉了她很多事情。太多了，记不清了 一些关于他们的心绑在一起的理论什么的。他用手指在她眼前的墙上画了一个小图表 仿佛这些看不见的痕迹能证明什么似的 他不停地画着三角形，并把它们放在顶端，对于其他两个角是什么，他有各种愚蠢的想法。但他吸引了她的注意力，因为他抓住了她。无论她多么想伤害他，他都会回来抱着她。这一定是真实的。黑暗的火焰一发不可收拾，吞噬了她的心。

“Shinji, I’ll try,” she remembered whispering at one point. “I’ll try to be better but I can’t promise it. Please, please don’t leave me. Please don’t despair of me. Please just keep holding me.”

And so he kept holding her, until dreams took her away.

"真嗣，我会努力的，"她记得自己在某一个时间窃窃私语。"我会努力变得更好，但我不能保证。求求你，不要离开我。请不要对我绝望 请一直抱着我"

就这样，他一直抱着她 直到梦把她带走

~

“Sounds like you two cried it out,” Misato said as he eased the door to their room closed.

“Yeah. I think we figured something out.”

She grinned. The sweat beading on her forehead glistened in the evening sun.

“Good. She’s going to be a handful（难搞的人）, you know.”

“I know.”

“But I bet you’re up to the challenge.”

"听起来你们两个哭了，"美里在他缓缓关上他们房间的门时说。

"是啊，我想我们想通了。"

她咧嘴一笑。她额头上的汗珠在傍晚的阳光下闪闪发光。

"那就好。她会是很难搞的人，你知道的。"

"我知道"

"但我打赌你一定能接受挑战"

Shinji pulled on his jacket. “I hope so.” He paused, looked at his hands, and he was smiling. “For once—I don’t want to run away.”

真嗣拉了拉外套。"但愿如此。" 他顿了顿，看了看自己的手，露出了笑容。"这一次，我不想逃跑。"

### Chapter 2: Winter

Winter came, and with it, something like happiness. Though she’d be the last to admit it.

They realized, finally, that Misato’s computer had the right date. It was November, and after they traced the days they’d been awake, they realized Third Impact had only lasted all of two days.

“All that, just for a crazy weekend no one will remember,” Misato had sighed, looking up from the calendar.

冬天来了，随之而来的是幸福。尽管她是最后一个承认这一点的人。

他们终于意识到，美里的电脑显示的日期是正确的。现在是 11 月，他们追溯了自己醒着的日子，发现第三次撞击只持续了两天。

"所有这一切，只是为了一个没有人会记得的疯狂周末，"美里从日历上抬起头叹了口气。

“Speak for yourself,” Asuka scowled. “I’ve got reminders.”

“Me too,” Misato said, sticking out her tongue and tugging up her shirt. Her wound was mostly healed, but it would scar, as Asuka’s wounds had. Shinji was the only one to escape unscathed（没有留疤的）, so to speak.

In the weeks after Misato’s arrival, they settled into a lazy routine. They went for walks, hands stuck into coat pockets, arm in arm. Asuka’s jealousy had mostly evaporated, but Misato was careful to keep her distance from Shinji or, if she did hug him or even kiss him when drunk, she made sure Asuka got the same treatment.

"你自己说吧。"明日香皱眉道。"我有提醒。"

"我也是。"美里说着，伸出舌头，拽起自己的衬衫。她的伤口大部分已经愈合，但还会留下疤痕，明日香的伤口也是如此。可以说，真嗣是唯一一个毫发无损的人。

在美里到来后的几周里，他们开始了慵懒的生活。他们手挽着手，插在大衣口袋里一起散步。明日香的醋意已经烟消云散，但美里还是小心翼翼地与真嗣保持距离，或者，如果她真的拥抱了他，甚至在喝醉的时候亲吻了他，她也会确保明日香得到同样的待遇。

“Gross,” Asuka had squealed after one such affectionate encounter.

“I just love you guys so much!” Misato squealed. “I love our little family!”

Our little family—Shinji and Asuka both rolled their eyes whenever Misato would go off on it. Asuka, especially, never allowed herself to invoke（引用） the phrase without a heavy slathering（大量涂抹） of irony but somewhere along the way, they had both begun to think of this living arrangement as—yes—something like a little family.

“真恶心，"明日香在一次这样深情的吻后尖叫起来。

"我太爱你们了！" 美里尖叫道。"我爱我们的小家庭！"

我们的小家庭--每当美里说到这里，真嗣和明日香都会翻白眼。尤其是明日香，她从来都不允许自己不带着浓浓的讽刺意味地提起这句话，但不知从什么时候开始，她们都开始把这种生活安排当成--是的--类似于一个小家庭。

If Misato noticed that Asuka’s over-the-top declarations of love had cooled, she said nothing. In their place, something else had sprouted（发芽）—something quiet but sturdy（坚实的）. Misato caught glimpses of it in moments when they thought she wasn’t looking: hands clasped, Shinji’s arms tugged tight around Asuka, her face buried in the crook of his neck. She’d collected these moments for herself in a psychic photobook（心灵相册） only she had access to, and she found herself smiling whenever she could add a new snapshot.

如果美里注意到明日香夸张的爱的宣言已经冷却，她什么也没说。取而代之的是另一种东西--一种安静而坚固的东西。美里在他们以为她不注意的时候瞥见了这一幕：双手紧握，真嗣的手臂紧紧搂着明日香，明日香的脸埋在他的颈窝里。她把这些瞬间收集在一本只有她自己才能使用的心灵影集里，每当她能添加一张新的快照时，她就会发现自己在微笑。

Shinji still cooked for them daily: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He cleaned, too, and never expected either of them to help. There was pleasure in these small tasks and though he didn’t mean to keep them all to himself, he knew they didn’t see it the way he did.

真嗣仍然每天为他们做饭：早餐、午餐和晚餐。他也打扫卫生，但从不指望他们俩帮忙。虽然他并不想把这些小事都留给自己，但他知道他们并不这么认为。

They went out to drink a few times a week. Occasionally, Misato became concerned that they (not her) were drinking too much. She’d institute a new rule that they could only drink one night a week, and it would last for all of three or four days—until Misato wanted drinking buddies. They made it through the bar book and Asuka learned, finally, to sip her cocktails.

他们每周都要出去喝几次酒。偶尔，美里会担心他们（不是她）喝得太多。她就会制定一个新的规则，规定她们一周只能喝一个晚上的酒，而且这个规则会持续三四天--直到美里想要酒友为止。她们终于在酒吧里喝完了酒单，明日香也终于学会了啜饮鸡尾酒。

Otherwise, there wasn’t much to do. Every day was quiet. Calm. Each of them waited for the inevitable caesura（音顿）: an Angel attack. An EVA going mad. Recently awakened new arrivals, raging in their confusion. But the placidity of those chilly days continued, uninterrupted.

除此之外，也没什么可做的。每天都很平静。静静的。他们每个人都在等待着不可避免的先兆：一个使徒的攻击。一个EVA发疯了。刚刚苏醒的新来者，在混乱中肆虐。但那些寒冷日子里的平静仍在继续，从未间断。

In private, Shinji and Asuka talked. A lot. Quietly, where Misato couldn’t hear. Asuka told him about her mother—he already knew some, and now he knew everything. He told her about his. What he remembered, at least. They talked for hours, in the quiet, staring at the ceiling, naked under the covers. Books they had read and wanted to read. Manga they liked and didn’t like. She told him about university and he wondered aloud if he’d ever go. She was brilliant, he realized: he’d already known it objectively, but now he was immersed in the steady stream of her thoughts. In another world, she’d already be one of the greatest scientists of her generation.

在私下里，真嗣和明日香聊了很多。在美里听不到的地方，悄悄地。明日香告诉他关于她母亲的事— 他已经知道了一些， 现在他知道了一切。 他也告诉了明日香他母亲的事。 至少是他记得的。 他们在安静的环境中，看着天花板，赤身裸体地躺在被子里，聊了好几个小时。他们读过的和想读的书。他们喜欢和不喜欢的漫画。她告诉他关于大学的事，他大声问自己是否会去上大学。他意识到，她很聪明：他已经客观地知道了这一点，但现在他沉浸在她源源不断的思绪中。在另一个世界，她已经是她那一代最伟大的科学家之一了。

“But in this world,” she’d say. “I’m just NERV’s trash.”

Something like happiness. But not happiness. They could be together, and it felt right to be. They could be in love, and somehow, in spite of everything they’d done to one another, that felt right too. But happiness eluded（避开）.

"但在这个世界，"她说， "我只是NERV的垃圾"

有点像幸福。 但不是幸福。 他们可以在一起， 这感觉是对的。 他们可以相爱，不知何故，尽管他们对彼此做了那么多，这感觉也是对的。但幸福却遥不可及。

Still, happiness was overrated. There was pleasure in being sad together, for what they had done and what they had lost and what had been done to them. Misato felt it too, and they could sit together on the balcony for hours, watching the sun set, drinking tea. One of them would say something—Asuka wondered aloud what had happened to Hikari; Shinji mentioned that Kaji’s watermelons must have died in the chills—and they would descend, together, into memories of the last year even as, faced with the changing sky, they knew the world progressed.

不过，幸福还是被高估了。为他们所做的一切、失去的一切以及对他们所做的一切而一起悲伤是一种快乐。美里也有同感，她们可以一起在阳台上坐上几个小时，看着夕阳西下，喝着茶。他们中的一个会说点什么--如明日香大声询问光发生了什么事；真嗣提到加持的西瓜一定是在寒风中死掉了--然后他们会一起陷入对过去一年的回忆中，即使面对不断变化的天空，他们也知道世界在进步。

Sometimes, after drinking, Misato especially would become sad.

“I had thought Kaji would follow me,” she said one evening, looking out over the dead city. “As soon as he saw I was gone. Maybe he died too long before Third Impact. Maybe he can’t.”

“He’ll come,” Asuka said. “Because you and I are here. He’ll find a way. It can’t be any fun in there without us.”

有时，喝完酒后，美里会变得特别悲伤。

一天傍晚，她望着死气沉沉的城市说："我本以为加治会跟着我。"他一看到我就走了。也许他在 "第三次冲击 "前死得太久了， 也许他不能回来了。

"他会回来的。"明日香说。"因为这里有你和我。他会找到办法的。没有我们，那里一点都不好玩。"

“We all came back so soon,” Shinji murmured. “But maybe it’s harder for other people.”

“Do you think your dad will come back?” Asuka leaned into him. “Because I wouldn’t mind pushing him off this balcony, if he did.”

“I think this is exactly what he wanted all along.” He was gripping the arms of the chair hard. “I think this is the only way he could be close to anyone. I feel like—I could have been like that.”

"我们都这么快就回来了，"真嗣喃喃道。"但也许对其他人来说更难"

"你觉得你爸爸会回来吗？" 明日香靠在他身上。"如果他会回来，我不介意把他推下阳台。"

"我觉得这正是他一直想要的" 他用力抓着椅子的扶手。"我觉得这是他唯一能和别人亲近的方式。"我觉得我也是这样"

“But you’re not, Shinji,” Misato whispered. “You’re kind. You’re brave. You care for other people.”

Asuka watched his face change.

“That’s enough, Misato,” she said, voice firm. “Shinji is Shinji. He—doesn’t need to be perfect.”

“I didn’t say he was! Just that he’s a wonderful guy who wouldn’t let us down.”

"但你不是，真嗣。"美里低声说。"你很善良 你很勇敢 你关心别人

明日香看着他的脸色变化。

"够了，美里。"她声音坚定地说。"真嗣就是真嗣。他不需要完美。"

"我没说他是完美的！只是说他是个不会让我们失望的好人。"

The two of them exchanged looks when Misato bowed her head to take a long sip of tea, but they said nothing. For the most part, she was in no hurry to talk about the events surrounding Third Impact except on the most macro level. She talked about wanting to find documentation, to write something down so people would know and understand what had happened to them. In another world, she would have been a politician, the kind who comes only once in a generation and inspires. An activist leader, fighting for justice. But here, in this world—she rose late, brushing off the cobwebs of last night’s binge, letting a child cook her breakfast and make her coffee. She sat until her head stopped aching, until the world stopped spinning, reading old magazines and trashy novels until enough time had elapsed that she could almost justify having another beer. Her entire life had been motion. Preparing for NERV. Running away with Kaji. Dashing across the world to fight the Angels. Now, she only left her apartment with Shinji and Asuka to pillage shops or wander, endlessly, waiting for unfamiliar faces to appear in empty Tokyo streets.

美里低头喝了一口茶，两人交换了一下眼神，但什么也没说。在大多数情况下，除了最宏观的层面，她并不急于谈论与 "第三次冲击 "有关的事件。她说她想找到文献资料，写下一些东西，让人们知道并了解发生在他们身上的事情。在另一个世界里，她本可以成为一名政治家，那种一代人中才会出现一次并能激励人心的政治家。一个为正义而战的活动领袖。但在这里，在这个世界--她起得很晚，拂去了昨晚狂欢的蛛网，让一个孩子为她做早餐、煮咖啡。她坐着，直到头不再疼痛，直到世界不再旋转，阅读旧杂志和垃圾小说，直到有足够的时间让她可以再喝一瓶啤酒。她的一生都在运动。为 NERV 做准备。和加持一起逃亡。飞奔到世界各地与使徒战斗。现在，她只和真嗣、明日香一起离开公寓，去抢劫商店或漫无目的地闲逛，在空无一人的东京街头等待陌生面孔的出现。

Asuka didn’t want to tell Misato what had happened between them. That was how she always phrased it, carefully: “What had happened.” Purging both of them of responsibility. She didn’t know how to be kind, but it seemed like this was the kind of thing a kind person would do, and so she tried it, even though saying the words—“I forgive you”—were still beyond her, and might be forever. Could you have love without forgiveness?

明日香不想告诉美里他们之间发生了什么。她总是这样小心翼翼地措辞 "发生了什么事" 把他们两个人的责任都推掉 她不知道该如何表达自己的善意，但这似乎是一个善良的人会做的事情，所以她试着这样做了，尽管说出 "我原谅你 "这样的话，她仍然无法做到，而且可能永远无法做到。没有宽恕，还能有爱吗？

“I think,” Shinji said, leaning over the balcony one evening. He could have jumped and she’d have followed him without a second thought. “That anything is possible. So don’t feel like you have to forgive me.”

"我想，"一天傍晚，真嗣靠在阳台上说。他本可以跳下去，而她会毫不犹豫地跟着他跳下去。"一切皆有可能。所以不要觉得你必须原谅我。"

“What about you?”

“What?”

“Do you forgive me?”

“For what?”

“Everything. I’ve been terrible to you. I still am, sometimes.”

“There’s nothing to forgive.”

“Oh, don’t do that, idiot. You play all noble but it stings.”

“Maybe it does,” he said, and she could see he was smiling.

"你呢？"

"什么？"

"你原谅我了吗？"

"原谅什么？

"所有的一切 我对你很不好 现在也是

"没什么好原谅的"

"哦，别这样，白痴。你装得很高尚，但这很伤人。"

"也许是的，"他说，她可以看到他在微笑。

“You’d prefer a girlfriend who was cute and sweet to you all the time. Who was always nice to you.”

He turned to lean on the railing in a way that made him seem older than he was. She liked when he did things like that.

“Well, first off, you are cute.”

“Liar.”

“You are. You’re the cutest.”

“You’re still lying, but your lies shall be tolerated for now,” she said, thrusting her nose into the air.

"你会更喜欢一个一直对你温柔可爱的女朋友 总是对你好的人"

他转身靠在栏杆上，显得比实际年龄要大。她喜欢他这样的举动。

"首先，你很可爱。"

"骗人"

"你很可爱 你是最可爱的。"

"你还在撒谎，不过暂时可以容忍你的谎言。"她说着，把鼻子伸向空中。

“And what I want isn’t necessarily what I need.”

“Right,” she said, with obvious pleasure. “I’m what you need.”

Something caught them at that moment—a rupture in the world, or maybe they both just blinked too hard at the same time.

“Did you feel that?” he whispered.

“I think so.”

"我想要的不一定是我需要的"

"对，"她说，带着明显的愉悦。"我就是你需要的"

在那一刻，有什么东西抓住了他们--世界的裂缝，或者他们俩只是同时眨了眨眼睛。

"你感觉到了吗？"他低声问。

"我想是的"

They waited a few minutes, but whatever had snared them didn’t return, and they drifted inside, where Misato was already passed out.

他们等了几分钟，但抓住他们的东西没有回来，他们飘进屋里，美里已经昏睡过去了。

The winter holidays arrived. At Asuka’s insistence, they drove into the mountains and cut down a fir tree to stick in the living room and decorate. She taught them German Christmas carols and giggled at their accents—“Stille Nacht” and “O! Tannenbaum!” simply weren’t built for the Japanese tongue.

The New Year approached. 2016.

寒假到了。在明日香的坚持下，他们开车到山里砍了一棵枞树，插在客厅里装饰起来。她教他们唱德语圣诞颂歌，还被他们的口音逗得咯咯直笑--"Stille Nacht "（平安夜）和 "O! Tannenbaum!"（圣诞树）根本就不是日本人的钢铁舌头能唱的(^_^)。

2016年新年临近。

“I have a feeling,” Misato had taken to saying. “That 2016 is going to be a great year. Everything is going to turn around.”

“2015 was pretty awful,” Shinji noted.

“Maybe 2016 will be worse,” Asuka suggested.

“I bet it’ll be worse,” Shinji agreed.

"我有一种预感，"美里经常这么说。"2016年将是伟大的一年。一切都会好转。"

"2015年很糟糕，"真嗣指出。

"也许 2016 年会更糟，"明日香建议道。

"我打赌会更糟。"真嗣表示同意。

“You two need to be more optimistic!” Misato all but roared. “2016 will be a great year.”

They cleaned the house and Shinji made pretty little bento boxes for the new year, with thawed fish. It wasn’t exactly the same as what he and Misato remembered, but it wasn’t like either of them had great memories associated with these holidays either.

"你们两个要乐观一点！" 美里几乎咆哮起来。"2016年将是美好的一年。"

他们打扫了屋子，真嗣用解冻的鱼为新年做了漂亮的小便当。这和他和美里记忆中的并不完全一样，但他们也都没有与这些节日相关的美好回忆。

“My dad was always working,” Misato had mentioned over beers in late December. “So we didn’t have much of a holiday spirit. I can’t imagine Commander Ikari was much for the holidays either.”

“I don’t even remember,” Shinji admitted.

"我爸爸总是在工作，"美里在 12 月底喝啤酒时提到。"所以我们没有什么节日气氛。我无法想象碇司令也不喜欢过节。"

"我都不记得了。"真嗣承认。

On the first day of the new year, they drove out of the city to a temple in the mountains, still relatively untouched by the destruction that had butchered Japan since the new century began. Shinji instructed Asuka in what to do at the temple.

“Japanese have such weird traditions,” she grumbled. Still, she held onto his arm as they climbed the steps to the temple. “It’s pretty out here and all but was it worth the drive?”

新年第一天，他们驱车离开城市，来到山中的一座寺庙，新世纪以来，日本遭受的破坏还相对较少。真嗣指导明日香在寺庙里该做些什么。

"日本人的传统真奇怪，"她抱怨道。不过，当他们爬上通往寺庙的台阶时，她还是紧紧抓住了他的胳膊。"这里很漂亮，但值得你开车来吗？"

“You’re Japanese too, Asuka! This is as much your heritage as it is ours,” Misato pointed out.

“Deutscherin bin ich erste, und dann Japanerin,” she scowled.

"明日香，你也是日本人！这是我们的传统，也是你的传统。"美里指出。

"我以前是德国人，现在是日本人，"她皱着眉头说。

They donated coins to the temple (not that they would be of any use), rang the temple’s ancient bell, bowed, clapped their hands, and bowed again. Afterwards, they wandered the empty temple until dark, talking about everything and nothing at all. Huddling together on the temple steps, drinking beer chilled by the cold, Asuka told them about cathedrals in Germany she remembered—the ones that hadn’t been destroyed in the cataclysm years ago. They, like this temple, had survived the unending bombings which seventy years prior had seemed to their grand-parents and great-grandparents to be hell on Earth. Of course, they had no idea then.

他们向寺庙捐献硬币（其实也没什么用），敲响寺庙的古钟，鞠躬，拍手，再鞠躬。之后，他们在空荡荡的寺庙里闲逛到天黑，什么都聊，什么都聊了。他们挤在寺庙的台阶上，喝着冰镇啤酒，明日香向他们讲述了她记忆中的德国大教堂--那些在多年前的大灾变中没有被摧毁的教堂。它们和这座寺庙一样，在七十年前无休止的轰炸中幸存了下来，在他们的祖父母和曾祖父母看来，那简直就是人间地狱。当然，他们当时都没有实感。

The sun set and from the temple, they had a magnificent view. Here, they couldn’t see Lillith’s massive body, or the crucified EVA’s, or even the sea of LCL. One could have pretended, here, that it had all been a dream—a strange fantasy dreamt up by a sick mind and nothing more.

夕阳西下，站在神殿上，他们看到了壮丽的景色。在这里，他们看不到莉莉丝庞大的身躯，也看不到被钉在十字架上的 EVA，甚至看不到 LCL 的海洋。在这里，人们可以假装这一切都是一场梦--一个病态心理幻想出来的奇怪的梦，仅此而已。

“Up here, it’s like nothing’s changed,” Shinji murmured. Alone, but not lonely, they sat, frozen witnesses to the apocalypse, each unwilling to be the first to leave.

"在这里，好像什么都没变，"真嗣喃喃地说。他们孤独但不寂寞地坐着，凝视着世界末日，每个人都不愿第一个离开。

Misato and Asuka fought over what to listen to. Misato listened, almost exclusively, to nineties pop music and it seemed calculated to drive Asuka crazy.

“This stuff is so—so—so—juvenile,” she scowled, flipping through Misato’s CDs. The binder she kept them in was old and so were the CDs, but she’d lost the aux cord to connect one of their mini-disc players, and it wasn’t like there was anything on the radio.

美里和明日香为听什么音乐而争吵。美里几乎只听九十年代的流行音乐，这似乎故意要把明日香逼疯。

"她皱着眉头翻着美里的 CD。她装这些 CD 的夹子很旧，CD 也很旧，但她把连接迷你碟机的辅助线弄丢了，而且收音机里也没有什么音乐。

“Well, what would be something mature?” Misato demanded.

“Something classical. Something intelligent. Shinji likes classical music too—proof of his good taste in music and women.”

“But this stuff makes me happy! Shinji, here, put this on—“ Misato said, flailing in the back seat for a CD. “Namie Amuro. ‘Can You Celebrate?’ This song was huge when I was a kid!”

"那么，什么才是成熟的东西呢？" 美里问道。

"古典的。有智慧的。真嗣也喜欢古典音乐，这证明他对音乐和女人都很有品味。"

"但这东西能让我开心！真嗣，来，放这个--"美里说着，在后座上翻找一张 CD。"安室奈美惠。‘Can You Celebrate?’这首歌在我小时候很流行！"

As they listened, Asuka scowled from the back seat.

“Idiotic! The English chorus is so dumb.”

“Then why are you swaying?” Misato demanded in triumph from the driver’s seat.

“I’m not! You’re swerving all over the road! We’re just lucky there’s no one out here but us.”

“It’s silly but it’s not awful,” Shinji offered.

“God, since when did you two become such critics? What do kids like these days?”

The kids looked at each other.

“Well, we’re the only ones left so—“

听着听着，明日香在后座上皱起了眉头。

"白痴！英语合唱太蠢了。"

"那你为什么摇摆？" 美里在驾驶座上得意地问道。

"我没有摇晃！你在路上到处乱晃！幸好这里除了我们没人。"

"这很傻，但并不可怕。"真嗣说。

"天啊，你们俩什么时候变得这么爱批评人了？现在的孩子都喜欢什么？"

孩子们面面相觑。

"嗯，只剩下我们了，所以......"

Shinji started to turn forward, looking into the freezing winter darkness when the car’s headlights caught a flash of white. Snow, he thought, but in a cold second, he saw he was wrong. It was a body. Stepping into the road.

信治开始转向前方，望着寒冬的黑暗，这时汽车的前灯闪过一道白光。他以为是雪，但在冰冷的瞬间，他发现自己错了。那是一个人影。踏上了路面。

“Misato!” he cried but it was too late. White flesh hit the car, flushed the windshield red, and then bounced, limbs flailing. The last thing Shinji saw before the body disappeared behind the car was a flash of pale blue hair.

"美里！"他喊道，但为时已晚。白色的肉体撞在汽车上，把挡风玻璃都撞红了，然后弹了起来，四肢乱舞。在人影消失在车后之前，真嗣最后看到的是一闪而过的淡蓝色头发。

“No,” he whispered, fumbling for the door before Misato had even stopped the car.

“Idiot, careful!” Asuka cried as he tripped leaping out of the car. She was out now too, helping him up and they were both running, followed by Misato.

“It can’t be her, it can’t be her,” Shinji whispered.

“Who is it?” Asuka hissed. “Did you see? Is it someone we know?”

"不，"他低声说，在美里还没停下车之前就摸索着开门。

"笨蛋，小心！" 明日香哭着说，他跳下车时被绊倒了。她也出来了，把他扶了起来，两人一起跑了起来，美里紧随其后。

"不可能是她，不可能是她。"真嗣低声说。

"是谁？" 明日香嘶声喊道。"你看到了吗？是我们认识的人吗？"

They found her a hundred meters back, slumped against a tree, panting. She wouldn’t raise her head to look at them. She was naked and splashed with blood. Shinji tore off his jacket and wrapped it around her as Asuka covered her mouth with both hands, bending into a silent scream.

“Ayanami,” he whispered.

他们在后方一百米处发现了她，她斜靠在一棵树上，气喘吁吁。她不愿抬头看他们。她赤身裸体，浑身是血。真嗣撕下自己的外套裹在她身上，明日香用双手捂住嘴，弯下腰发出无声的尖叫。

"绫波，"他低声说道。

~

She wanted to leave.

She was tired of this place-that-was-not-a-place. Embedded though she was in this tapestry of souls, something felt off.

She missed people.

她想离开。

她厌倦了这个不是地方的地方。虽然她已经融入了这个由灵魂组成的挂毯，但还是觉得有些不对劲。

她想念大家。

That, quite literally, was it. She missed their distinctions, and she missed specific, distinct people. She had said goodbye to them and now, she was lonely.

A failure. This was an utter failure. Whatever they had intended to make of this evolution, if she could feel loneliness here, it hadn’t worked.

Would it matter if she stayed?

就是这样。她怀念他们的不同，怀念那些具体而独特的人。她已经和他们告别了，现在，她很孤独。

失败 这是一次彻底的失败。不管他们想让这种进化变得怎样，如果她能在这里感受到孤独，那就没有成功。

她留下来有什么关系吗？

She suspected it would not. She suspected that she was not, ultimately, in control of her actions regardless, and that the impulse calling her to rejoin the world would triumph in the end.

Control or not, though, she couldn’t deny that there were people she wanted to see. If only to prove to them that she was no doll.

她怀疑不会。她怀疑，无论如何，她最终都无法控制自己的行为，而召唤她重返世界的冲动最终会取得胜利。

不过，不管她能否控制自己，她都无法否认，她想见一些人。如果只是为了向他们证明她不是玩偶的话。

With a gasp, cold air filled her lungs. She had lungs once more! The air ached in them as she wheezed, kneeling on the chilled sand, gazing at the water she had just risen from. No one, there, would miss her. Even if they realized who she was. Her soul was one thing, but that wasn’t the same as a person, and she was a person. A person was a doll with a soul, but somehow more than the sum of those parts. She dug her fingers into her sand. It felt cold and good.

随着一声喘息，冷空气充满了她的肺部。她再次拥有了肺！她喘着粗气，跪在冰冷的沙滩上，凝视着刚刚从水中浮起的肺，空气在肺里痛得要命。在那里，没有人会想念她。即使他们知道她是谁。她的灵魂是一回事，但那和人不一样，她是一个人。人是有灵魂的玩偶，但又比这些部分的总和要多一些。她把手指伸进沙子里。感觉又凉又好。

Rei stood and stretched. Now to find them. Her—

She felt a pain in her throat. She tried to swallow it but it wouldn’t go away. She’d have to ask them about it. Her—

Why am I crying, she wondered, touching her tear-slicked cheeks. She’d have to ask them. Her—

Friends.

丽站了起来，伸了个懒腰。现在去找他们。她的—

她感到喉咙一阵疼痛。她想咽下去，但怎么也咽不下去。她得问问他们。她的—

我为什么哭了，她抚摸着自己泪流满面的脸颊，想知道。她得问问他们。她的—

朋友们

Rei drew hoarse, aching breaths. Now, something in her chest stung in a distinctly unpleasant way. Ikari’s jacket was drawn tight around her nakedness and she attempted to apologize to him for bleeding on it, but she couldn’t get the words out.

This was quite embarrassing.

“Ayanami, it’s going to be okay,” Ikari was saying, holding her head to his chest. His fingers stroked her hair. This would have been rather nice in any other scenario but she was getting a cramp in her neck.

丽嘶哑而痛苦地呼吸着。现在，她胸口的东西明显地刺痛着她。真嗣的外套紧紧地裹着她的裸体，她试图向他道歉，因为她的衣服上有血迹，但她说不出话来。

这让她相当尴尬。

"绫波，不会有事的。"真嗣把她的头抱在胸前说。他的手指抚摸着她的头发。这在任何其他情况下都是相当不错的，但她的脖子开始抽筋了。

“Rei, what the hell were you doing?” Asuka kept asking. Looking for you three, she had wanted to say. She had seen the car, from the beach, on the way up the mountain and had tried to walk along the wooded roads to meet them there. She’d gotten lost and it was only when she stepped out of the forest, half-frozen, that she saw the car whipping around a bend. Good, she had thought, in the moment before they hit her. I found them.

"丽，你到底在干什么？" 明日香不停地问。她想说，我在找你们三个。在上山的路上，她在海滩上看到了那辆车，于是她想沿着林间小道走过去和他们会合。她迷路了，当她走出森林，冻得半死时，才看到汽车在拐弯处呼啸而过。很好，在他们撞上她之前的那一刻，她想。我找到他们了。

“Rei, hang on, we’re almost at the hospital,” Misato was yelling from the front seat.

“What good is that going to do? There’re no doctors,” Asuka yelled back.

“But there’ll be something. We have a better chance of saving her there than anywhere else.”

"丽，坚持住，我们快到医院了。"美里在前座大喊。

"那有什么用？那里没有医生。"明日香大声回道。

"但一定会有的。我们在那里比在其他地方更有机会救她。"

She must have passed out, because when she awoke, she was on a gurney. She’d been in many hospital rooms in her life (lives?) and so this did not particularly alarm her. Ikari was bent over her, wiping the blood from her body and cleaning her wounds. She tried to smile at him but he didn’t notice. It was kind of him to be so focused.

“Her ribs are definitely broken,” she heard Asuka saying. “And she’s coughing up blood. My guess is that one of her ribs punctured her lung. If we don’t do something and fast, she’s going to drown in her own blood.”

她一定是昏过去了，因为当她醒来时，她正躺在轮床上。她一生（几生？）中住过很多次病房，所以这并没有让她感到特别惊慌。真嗣弯着腰，为她擦拭身上的血迹，清洗伤口。她试着对他微笑，但他没有注意到。他能如此专注，真是太好了。

"她的肋骨肯定断了，"她听到明日香说。"她还在咳血。我猜她的一根肋骨刺穿了肺部。如果我们不尽快采取措施，她就会被自己的血淹死。"

Oh. That didn’t sound good.

“What do we do?” Misato wondered aloud. “I’m not a surgeon. Setting a broken bone is one thing but this…”

哦 . 听起来不妙

"我们该怎么办？" 美里大声问道。"我不是外科医生。接骨是一回事，但这个......"

Asuka looked at Ikari and then at Rei. Rei tried to smile at her but if the Second Child noticed, she didn’t return the smile. No, she really was only looking at Ikari. Misato was talking but Asuka wasn’t paying any attention.

And then, she was out the door.

“Where are you going?” Misato called down the hall.

“Med school,” Asuka called back. “I’m gonna’ save that idiot.”

明日香看了看真嗣，又看了看丽。但如果明日香注意到的话，丽试着对她笑了笑，她并没有回以微笑。不，她真的只是在看真嗣。美里在说话，但明日香并没有注意到这一点。

然后，她出了门。

"你要去哪儿？" 美里在大厅里叫道。

"医学院" 明日香回道 "我要去救那个白痴"

~

Asuka made a bee-line for a row of offices she had noted on their way in. All empty, of course, but that was to be expected. She aimed a hard kick at one of the doors and it flung open. Unlocked. Maybe it wasn’t necessary, but it had certainly felt good.

明日香在来的路上就注意到一排办公室。当然，所有办公室都是空的，但这也在意料之中。她对准其中一扇门狠狠地踢了一脚，门被踢开了。门没锁。也许没有必要，但感觉确实不错。

She scanned the office. A medical textbook in Japanese wasn’t going to help her. Her kanji had gotten better, but she wasn’t going to waste time figuring out the radicals in the characters for “pulmonary hemorrhaging.” She stormed the next office, and then the next one, and here she spied something that gave her hope. A Harvard University medical degree framed on the wall. The bookshelf held journals in English, Japanese, and French but it wasn’t the journals she was after. A few minutes perusal rewarded her with a faded surgical textbook, and a binder full of notes. Both were in English.

她扫视了一下办公室。日语医学教科书帮不了她。她的汉字水平有所提高，但她不会浪费时间去弄清 "肺出血 "的偏旁部首。她冲进了下一间办公室，又冲进了下一间，在这里她看到了让她看到希望的东西。墙上挂着哈佛大学的医学学位证书。书架上有英文、日文和法文的期刊，但她要找的不是这些期刊。几分钟后，她看到了一本褪色的外科教科书和一个装满笔记的活页夹。两本书都是英文的。

Asuka sat down at the doctor’s empty desk, flicked on the desk lamp, and began to study. She read quickly, committing entire passages to memory as she’d been able to do ever since childhood. She’d never performed a surgery before, but Asuka Langley Soryu wasn’t the type to let something like that stop her.

明日香在医生空荡荡的办公桌前坐下，打开台灯，开始学习。她读得很快，就像她从小就能做到的那样，把整段文字都记在了脑子里。她以前从未做过手术，但明日香-兰格雷-惣流并不是那种会被这种事情阻挡的人。

An hour later, she stormed back into Rei’s hospital room. Misato and Shinji looked up. Shinji had been crying. The idiot. He should have more faith in me.

“Let’s do this,” Asuka growled and cracked her knuckles. “We’re going to operate.”

“You’re not a surgeon,” Shinji observed.

一小时后，她冲回了丽的病房。美里和真嗣抬起头。真嗣一直在哭 这个笨蛋 他应该对我更有信心。

"让我们开始吧！"明日香咆哮着，敲打着指关节。"我们要动手术了"

"你不是外科医生，"真嗣观察道。

“But I just speed-read a textbook on surgery. And sections on blood transfusions and local anesthesia. Putting her under will be too risky and we don’t have time for that anyway, but we can at least dull the pain somewhat.”

"但我刚才速读了一本关于外科手术的教科书。还有输血和局部麻醉的章节 给她麻醉太冒险了 而且我们也没时间了 但我们至少可以减轻一点疼痛"

“You’re serious,” Misato murmured. “You’re actually serious.”

“I won’t let something trivial like a punctured lung beat me,” she affirmed. “I’m going to save her stupid life and she’s going to spend the rest of it worshipping the ground I walk on.”

“Rei, what do you think?” Shinji asked after a moment. Rei’s gave a quick thumbs-up.

"你是认真的。"美里喃喃地说。"你真的是认真的"

"我不会被像肺被刺穿这样的小事打败的。"她肯定地说。"我将拯救她愚蠢的生命 她将用余生来膜拜我走过的土地"

"丽，你怎么想？" 过了一会儿，真嗣问道。丽迅速竖起了大拇指。

“That’s more like it. First things first—Shinji, Schätzchen, we need your blood. If I remember correctly, and I do, you’re both Type A. She’s lost some and she’s going to lose a lot more. Misato, in the meanwhile, I have a list of things for you to find me. Let’s go!”

He seemed dazed as she led him into another room, where she sat him down. She gave him a ball to squeeze and fingered a prominent vain in the crook of his elbow.

“Do you really think this is going to work?” he asked as she finished setting up the equipment and cleaned the spot she would attack.

"这还差不多。 首先— 真嗣， 亲爱的， 我们需要你的血。 如果我没记错的话， 你们都是A型血。 她已经失血而且还会失很多血。 美里，与此同时，我有一张清单上的东西需要你去找。我们行动吧！"

她把他领到另一个房间，让他在那里坐下，他似乎有些茫然。她给了他一个球让他捏，并用手指在他肘弯处标出一个虚拟的点。

"你真的认为这会有用吗？"当她安装完设备并清理完她要扎针的地方时，他问道。

“Positive.”

“Seriously? Ah—“ he gasped as she stuck him. The tubing turned a dark red-brown as his arm yielded up blood to her.

She took his face in her hand.

"肯定"

"真的吗？啊--"他被她扎得喘不过气来。当他的手臂输出血液时，管子变成了深红棕色。

她用手捧起他的脸。

“Shinji, you said it yourself. I’m good at a lot of things. I can learn things fast. That’s what I’ve always done.” She kissed him and reached down to make sure he was still squeezing the ball. “That’s why it pissed me off when you would get a Synch Rate higher than mine. Because you’re so much dumber than me in every possible way. So please: trust me. I’m going to save her and then you will never, ever see her naked ever again. Just start planning what you’re going to make for breakfast and I’ll take care of the rest.”

"真嗣，你自己说的。我擅长很多事情 我学东西很快 我一直都是这么做的。" 她吻了他一下，伸手确认他还在捏着球。"所以当你的同步率比我高时，我很生气。因为你在各方面都比我笨。所以请相信我。我会救她的，然后你就再也看不到她的裸体了。开始计划你的早餐吧 剩下的交给我吧"

She kissed him once more and went to check on Misato.

她再次吻了他，然后去看美里。

“I guess if there’s anyone who can do this, it’s you,” Misato murmured as she pulled on scrubs and gloves. Shinji would be too woozy from the transfusion to help her and besides—Asuka had doubts that he wouldn’t freeze up seeing Rei in pain. Misato, for all her flaws, she could rely on to be decisive. “You’re the smartest of all of us. I forget that sometimes.”

"我想，如果有谁能做到这一点，那就是你了。"美里一边喃喃自语，一边穿上手术服，戴上手套。真嗣会晕血，无法帮助她，况且明日香也怀疑他看到丽痛苦的样子会不会呆住。美里虽然有很多缺点，但她可以依靠她的果断。"你是我们当中最聪明的人。我有时会忘记这一点。"

“Very funny.”

“It wasn’t a joke. I guess you don’t get many opportunities to show it off.”

“I’m not showing off. I’m saving Rei’s life.”

“I know. But you’re showing off a little, aren’t you?” Misato smiled. “For Shinji.”

“Oh, shut up.”

“He’s going to be impressed if you pull this off.”

“He’d better be. You all had better be. I just shotgunned an entire surgery course.”

“You’re not nervous?” Misato’s head cocked to the side.

"很好笑"

"这不是玩笑 我猜你很少有机会炫耀它。"

"我没有炫耀。我在救丽的命"

"我知道 但你有点炫耀，不是吗？" 美里笑了 "为了真嗣"

"哦，闭嘴"

"如果你成功了，他会对你刮目相看的"

"最好是这样 你们最好都是。我刚把整个外科手术都学了一遍"

"你不紧张吗？" 美里的头歪向一边。

“Nervous? Why would I be nervous? This isn’t an Angel.” They stared at each other. “Okay, but I’m not fighting her. This is a human body. I took courses on anatomy and physiology. I’m going to fix her. Just like a mechanic fixing a car.”

“It’s a shame what NERV did to you kids,” Misato sighed. She followed Asuka into the operating room, pulling a mask over her face and muffling her voice. Rei lay before them, taking shallow breaths, half-conscious.

“Don’t pity me,” Asuka just scowled. “You said 2016 was going to be a great year, didn’t you? I’m about to make it even better.”

"紧张？我为什么要紧张？这又不是使徒。" 两人对视着。"好吧，但我不是在和她战斗。这是人体。我上过解剖学和生理学课程。我要治好她。就像机械师修车一样"

"NERV对你们这些孩子的所作所为真是令人遗憾。"美里叹了口气。她跟着明日香走进手术室，拉过面罩蒙住脸，压低声音。丽躺在她们面前，浅浅地呼吸着，半昏迷着。

"别可怜我。"明日香只是皱了皱眉头。"你不是说 2016 年会是美好的一年吗？我要让它变得更好。"

Shinji lay on the bench facing the operating room door, staring at the clock. An hour had passed. Then two. He drifted off at one point, only to awake with a start and see that not more than five minutes had elapsed. Whenever he sat up, the hall started to quake and he returned to the safety of the bench.

Ayanami had reappeared. Was it really her? That would be a tricky question to answer, no matter what. Moreover, she was—something more than just them. Still. It was good to see her. He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed her. The prospect that they’d lose her now, though, was… No. He had to trust that Asuka would figure this out. If she set her mind to it, after all, there was nothing she couldn’t do.

But—if she failed—not only would they lose Ayanami, Asuka would… He didn’t want to think about that possibility.

真嗣躺在手术室门前的长椅上，盯着时钟。一个小时过去了。然后是两个小时。他一度昏昏欲睡，醒来时才发现时间还不到五分钟。每当他坐起来，大厅就开始颤抖，他又回到安全的长椅上。

丽又出现了。真的是她吗？无论如何，这都是一个棘手的问题。而且，她对他们的意义不仅仅是她这个人。不过 见到她真好 他还没意识到自己有多想念她。他必须相信明日香会想出办法的。只要她下定决心，就没有做不到的事。

但是，如果她失败了，不仅他们会失去绫波丽，明日香也会......他不想去想这种可能性。

“Hey, idiot.”

His eyes shot open. He was nauseous（恶心的） as he sat up. Asuka stood before him, clad in blue scrubs, her hair pulled up and a face mask tugged down around her neck. She was sweaty and flushed but grinning bigger than he’d ever seen.

"嘿，白痴"

他猛地睁开眼睛。当他坐起来时，感到一阵恶心。明日香站在他面前，穿着蓝色的手术服，头发挽起，脖子上戴着口罩。她满头大汗，面色潮红，但咧嘴笑得比他见过的还要灿烂。

“How is she?” he stammered out. If she were smiling—

“How great do you think I am?”

“You’re the best, Asuka.”

"她怎么样？"他结结巴巴地问。如果她在笑

"你觉得我有多棒？"

"你是最棒的，明日香"

“Hmm? Could you say that again? A little bit louder? So all of humanity can hear? Even though all of humanity is here on this floor, in this hospital?”

He threw his arms around her waist and pressed his head into her belly. She gave a yelp and lay her hands on his head.

“You’re the best,” he repeated, and only she could hear it, but he knew she’d prefer that.

"嗯，你能再说一遍吗？再大声一点？让全人类都能听到？尽管全人类都在这层楼里，在这家医院里？"

他搂住她的腰，把头贴在她的小腹上。她发出一声尖叫，双手抱住他的头。

"你是最棒的，"他重复道，只有她能听到，但他知道她更喜欢这样。

“You’re exactly right. Wondergirl agreed too. Said she barely felt it. She’s pretty out of it but she’s awake. Or she might be totally fine. You can’t really tell with her.”

“You really did it. You saved her.”

Her grip around his neck was tight.

"你说得对极了。优等生也同意了 她说她几乎没有感觉。她很不清醒，但她还醒着。或者她可能完全没事。她的情况还真不好说。"

"你真的做到了 你救了她。"

她紧紧地搂住他的脖子。

“We didn’t give each other Christmas presents but… maybe you should find me something,” she mused, teasing his hair. “Since I gave you Rei.”

“Whatever you want, Asuka.”

“No! It’s more romantic if you pick something out, Dummkopf. I’ll tell you if I don’t like it and you have to find something new. And it’d better be fancy, since you can steal it.”

"我们没有互赠圣诞礼物，不过......也许你应该给我找点什么，"她喃喃自语，逗弄着他的头发。"既然我给了你丽"

"你想要什么都行，明日香"

"不！如果你能挑点什么，那就更浪漫了，傻瓜。如果我不喜欢，我会告诉你的，然后你就得找新的了。而且最好是时髦的，因为你可以零元购。"

He was grinning through tears. He pulled her onto his lap.

“You’re amazing,” he whispered in her ear.

“I know.”

She ran her fingers down his neck, over his collar bone.

“It’s silly that Japanese has so many ways of saying it.”

“What?”

“You know.”

“Oh. There’s only one in German?”

他流着泪，咧嘴笑着。他把她拉到自己腿上

"你真了不起"，他在她耳边轻声说

"我知道"

她的手指顺着他的脖子划过他的锁骨

"日语有这么多表达方式，真傻。"

"什么？"

"你知道的"

"哦，德语只有一种说法？"

“Ich.” She pointed at herself. “Liebe dich.” She jabbed him in the chest. “That’s it. But in Japanese, it’s different if you’re just starting out or if you’ve been in love for a while or what. For example, what would you say to me right now?”

"我" 她指着自己。 "爱你" 她戳了戳他的胸口 "。就是这样。 但在日语中，如果你刚开始恋爱 或者你已经恋爱了一段时间或者其他什么，那就不一样了。比如，你现在会对我说什么？"

They didn’t say it often. It felt too raw to use every day, as if exposing it to the air too much would cause it to wilt. Shinji, though, told her then, in the way that felt most natural. She looked away from him.

他们没有经常说。每天都说就感觉太生硬了，好像暴露在空气中太多就会枯萎一样。不过，真嗣当时用最自然的方式告诉了她。她把目光从他身上移开。

“What’s wrong?”

“I just like the way it sounds. The way you say it. Idiot. It makes me feel…”

“Warm?”

She elbowed him in the arm, still sore from the transfusion.

“Ow! What was that for?”

“For almost making me cry. Almost. Go see her, idiot.”

"怎么了？"

"我只是喜欢它的发音 你说话的方式。傻瓜。 这让我感觉......"

"温暖？"

她用手肘撞了撞他的胳膊，输血后还有些疼痛。

"噢，那是为什么？"

"因为差点让我哭出来。差点 去看她吧，八嘎。"

He pushed her off and she groaned. As he staggered to his feet, she caught his hand.

“Hey. I did really great, didn’t I?”

“You did. You knocked it out of the park.”

She didn’t let go.

“Hey, Shinji.”

“Yeah?”

“Are you happy?”

“What? Right now? Totally.”

“Good.”

“Are you?”

She shook her head. “No. Definitely not. Everything still hurts. But—“ Her lips crinkled in a strange way and she took a deep breath. “But after today, I think that, someday, maybe, I could be.”

他推开她，她发出一声呻吟。当他跌跌撞撞地站起来时，她抓住了他的手。

"嘿，我做得很棒，不是吗？"

"没错，你做得很好。"

她没有松手

"嘿，真嗣"

"是吗？"

"你开心吗？"

"什么？现在？非常开心

"很好"

"你呢？"

她摇了摇头 "不，肯定不好。一切都还很疼。但是--" 她的嘴唇以一种奇怪的方式皱了起来，深吸了一口气。"但今天之后，我想，有一天，也许，我可以。"

Misato held Rei’s hand. The girl had drifted in and out of consciousness during the operation, grunting or gasping occasionally, but now she was calm, breathing deep. Her pulse was fast—the lidocaine would do that, Asuka had noted when she took her pulse during the surgery, but it also slowed bleeding so it shouldn’t be a problem—but steady. She marveled at this creature, whom she thought she’d never see again, laying before her, plucked from the jaws of death with the utmost joy and confidence.

美里握着丽的手。在手术过程中，女孩的意识时隐时现，偶尔发出哼哼声或喘息声，但现在她很平静，深呼吸着。她的脉搏很快--明日香在手术过程中为她把脉时注意到利多卡因会有这种作用，但它也会减缓出血速度，所以应该不成问题--但很平稳。她惊叹地看着眼前这个她以为再也见不到的生物，带着无比的喜悦和自信从死神的口中被救出。

Indeed, Asuka had never seemed more in her element. She narrated, expertly, what she was doing, and Misato took notes whenever she had a chance. The gore didn’t faze her young charge in the slightest. If anything, Misato guessed Asuka might even have enjoyed it.

的确，明日香从未像现在这样如鱼得水。她娴熟地讲述着自己正在做的事情，美里一有机会就做笔记。这些血腥场面丝毫没有吓到她年轻的助手。如果有的话，美里猜想明日香甚至会乐在其中。

“I’m kind of glad Wondergirl is going to have some gross scars too. It’d be unfair if she got away with nothing.”

“Oh, don’t say that,” shushed Misato.

“But it’s true! I know it’s not her fault but I don’t want her looking better than me.”

"我很高兴优等生也会有一些严重的伤疤 如果她什么都没留下就太不公平了。"

"哦，别这么说。"美里嘘了一声。

"但这是事实！我知道这不是她的错，但我不想让她看起来比我好。"

“Shinji’s not going to jump ship like that.” Misato saw the scalpel hesitate for a second, hovering above Rei’s incised flesh. “Sorry. Focus on what you’re doing. But he won’t. You can trust him.”

“I wonder if I can.”

“Second Child,” Rei murmured. They both looked up. Rei held her head a few inches off the table and Misato rushed to try and press her back down.

"真嗣不会就这样跳船的" 美里看到手术刀犹豫了一下，在丽被切开的皮肉上方徘徊。"对不起 。专心你正在做的事。但他不会的。你可以相信他

"我想知道我能不能做到"

"二号机驾驶员，"丽喃喃地说。他们都抬起头。丽把头抬离桌子几英寸，美里急忙试图把她按回去。

“Rei, try and relax, just try and go to sleep, I know it hurts—“

“I have felt far worse pain, Major Katsuragi.” She squinted and focused her eyes on Asuka. “I love Ikari.”

“Rei,” Misato whispered. “Don’t do this right now.”

"丽，试着放松，试着入睡，我知道很痛..."

"我感受过更痛的，葛城少佐" 她眯起眼睛，注视着明日香。"我爱碇君"

"丽，"美里低声说。"现在别这么做"

“And I want to be with him. And you. And Major Katsuragi.” She took a breath. “You are my friends. I was lonely when you left. But I wish for you and Ikari to be in love. It makes me happy.”

Misato turned her gaze to Asuka. Her eyes were red, but she wasn’t crying.

“It’s not up to you, Wondergirl.”

"我想和他在一起 。还有你 。还有葛城少佐 。”她深吸一口气 "你们是我的朋友 你离开时，我很寂寞 但我希望你和真嗣能相爱 这让我很开心"

美里把目光转向明日香。她的眼睛红红的，但没有哭。

"这不是你能决定的，优等生"

“I know that. I’m merely stating my preference.” She cleared her throat a little unsteadily. “You realize that my body is cloned from the remains of his mother?”

“Yes.”

“I believe intimacy between myself and Ikari would be frowned on in most societies. For that reason, and that reason alone, I will not pursue him romantically or sexually, although I am tempted to.”

"我知道 我只是说出我的想法。" 她有点颤抖地清了清嗓子。"你知道我的身体是用他母亲的遗体克隆的吗？"

"知道"

"我相信，在大多数社会里，我和碇君之间的亲密关系都是不被允许的。出于这个原因，也仅仅是这个原因，我不会对他展开浪漫或性方面的追求，尽管我很想这样做。"

For a full minute, the only sound was Rei’s slow, ragged breathing.

“I’m sorry,” she said finally. “That was a joke.” Misato exhaled and Asuka slumped. She flailed her fist out and pounded a table, knocking a plateful of unused instruments onto the floor.

整整一分钟，只有丽缓慢而粗重的呼吸声。

"对不起。"她最后说。"那只是个玩笑。" 美里呼出一口气，明日香也颓然坐下。她挥舞着拳头猛击桌子，将一盘未使用的工具打落在地。

“You’re not funny, damn it!”

“Then why is Major Katsuragi laughing?”

“Because, Rei, sometimes we laugh because we’re extremely nervous.”

"你一点都不好笑，该死！"

"那为什么葛城少佐在笑？"

"因为，丽，有时候我们笑是因为我们非常紧张"

Rei was quiet for the rest of the operation and soon, it was over. Misato exhaled once more, feeling as if she’d been holding her breath for the entire three hours. As Asuka stripped off her gloves and stalked out of the operating room, Misato sunk into the chair next to the girl. Red eyes fluttered open to look at her.

丽在接下来的行动中一直保持沉默，很快，手术就结束了。美里再一次呼出了一口气，感觉自己似乎憋了整整三个小时的气。当明日香脱下手套，步出手术室时，美里坐到了女孩旁边的椅子上。美里睁开红红的眼睛看着她。

“Rei, I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “But you’re going to be okay now.”

“I know. I was quite hopeful when I realized the Second Child was going to operate on me. She’s highly intelligent. I expect I will make a full recovery.”

“I’m so sorry this happened. I didn’t see you.”

“I was trying to catch up to you all but I got lost.” She blinked a few times. “What day is it? Has it been long since you returned?”

“It’s January first. For another hour, at least.”

"丽，我很抱歉，"她低声说。"但你现在会没事的"

"我知道。当我知道二号机驾驶员要给我做手术时，我还满怀希望。她非常聪明。我希望我能完全康复。"

"发生这种事我很抱歉 我没看到你

"我本想追上你们，但迷路了" 她眨了几下眼睛。"今天是什么日子？你回来很久了吗？"

"今天是一月一日。零一个小时，至少。"

“In that case, Happy New Year, Major Katsuragi. I would have liked to join you all for the holiday’s festivities.”

“We can have festivities when you’re feeling a bit better, Rei. I promise.” Misato had worked her fingers into the girl’s damp hair. “You came back to us. I can’t believe it.”

“After you left, I realized how lonely it was. I was afraid.”

“I know. I know, it’s scary.”

"既然如此，新年快乐，葛城少佐。我本来想和大家一起过节的"

"等你好些了，我们再庆祝吧，丽。我保证。" 美里把手指伸进女孩湿漉漉的头发里。"你回到了我们身边 真不敢相信

"你离开后，我意识到自己有多孤单。我很害怕

"我知道，这很可怕"

"我知道. 我知道，这很可怕。"

Her breathing slowed and she seemed to be sleeping. Finally, Misato thought. She’s earned some rest.

“Major Katsuragi, more will come back. Soon. Do not despair yet,” she murmured. Misato felt herself take a small, sharp gasp. Thank you, she mouthed.

They enjoyed the silence for only a few moments, however. The doors creaked open and two teenaged heads peeked in. Misato pressed a finger to her lips but beckoned them in. Sleeping, she mouthed. Shinji sat next to her and Asuka stood, triumphant, over Rei.

她的呼吸减慢了，似乎睡着了。美里想，她终于可以休息一下了。她终于可以休息一下了

"葛城少佐，会有更多的人回来的。很快就会回来的。先不要绝望，"她喃喃地说。美里感到自己剧烈地喘了一口气。谢谢你，她喃喃地说。

然而，她们只享受了片刻的宁静。门吱呀一声开了，两个少年的头探了进来。美里把手指放在嘴唇上，示意他们进来。睡吧，她嘟囔着。真嗣坐在她旁边，明日香站在丽的身旁，一脸胜利的神情。

“What did I tell you?” she whispered in a voice almost too loud to be a whisper. “All in one piece. Mostly.”

Rei’s eyes fluttered open and she found Shinji. She smiled.

“Ayanami,” he whispered. “Welcome back.”

“Happy New Year, Ikari,” she whispered.

"我怎么跟你说的？"她小声嘀咕道，声音大得几乎不像耳语。"基本完美。"

丽的眼睛睁开了，她发现了真嗣。她笑了

"绫波，"他低声说，"欢迎回来。"

"新年快乐，碇君，"她低声说

~

Now, they had something to do each day. Secretly, each of them was happy for a mission to give structure to their days. Someone stayed in the hospital with Rei at all times—usually, it was Misato overnight, while Shinji and Asuka took the day shift. They all had dinner together, in a hospital room they’d commandeered for Rei. Shinji made elaborate bento boxes for everyone and they sat, trading stories or talking, until Rei nodded off.

现在，他们每天都有事可做。暗地里，他们每个人都很高兴能有一项任务来安排自己的每一天。医院里一直有人陪着丽--通常是美里值夜班，而真嗣和明日香值白班。他们一起在为丽征用的病房里吃晚饭。真嗣为每个人精心制作了便当，他们坐在一起，有的讲故事，有的聊天，直到丽打瞌睡。

“Our little family is growing,” Misato had squeal-whispered to the other two as she slept.

Rei slept a lot. Asuka was worried, initially, but Rei confided in her that she believed this to be a hangover effect from her exertion during Third Impact.

“It was very tiring,” she had yawned to her ersatz doctor. “If you have never forcibly evolved an entire species, I do not know how to describe it.”

"我们的小家庭越来越大了。"美里在睡觉时对另外两个人娇声说道。

丽睡了很多觉。明日香起初很担心，但丽告诉她，她认为这是第三次撞击时的疲劳造成的宿醉。

"她对她的假医生打了个哈欠说："太累了。"如果你没有强行进化过整个物种，我不知道该如何形容。"

“Show off,” Asuka scowled and decided to lower her painkillers even more. “This will show you.”

After a week, Rei was getting stronger and able to walk about the hospital unaided, though she tired easily. They brought her home and installed her in Misato’s third bedroom—what had once been Asuka’s room.

“I do not have many possessions, Second Child,” she had assured Asuka as Shinji carried Asuka’s things by the armful into his room. “So you may use my room for storage as you wish.”

"炫耀吧！"明日香不屑一顾，决定把降低一些止痛药剂量。"这会让你知道的。"

一周后，丽的身体越来越强壮，虽然很容易疲倦，但已经可以在医院里不用人搀扶行走了。他们把她带回家，把她安置在美里的第三间卧室--曾经是明日香的房间。

"当真嗣把明日香的东西大把大把地搬进他的房间时，她向明日香保证说："二号机驾驶员，我没有太多的行李。"所以你可以随意使用我的房间作为储藏室。"

“You bet I will, First Child,” she’d retorted. Then, she frowned. “Hey, why don’t you call me Asuka? I feel like we’re on a first-name basis now. Our souls merged and I pulled one of your broken ribs out of your lung.”（-asuka太可爱了）

"你打赌我会的，原型机驾驶员，"她反驳道。然后，她皱起了眉头。"嘿，你为什么不叫我明日香呢？我觉得我们现在都已经直呼其名了。"我们的灵魂融合在一起 我把你断掉的一根肋骨从肺里拔出来"

“Asuka,” Rei said, as is trying it out. “Asuka.”

“Yeah. See? It’s not so bad. Rei.”

“It is strange. To call someone by their first name.”

“But that’s what friends do. You can get cutesy with it too. Japanese has lots of options for that but—“

Friends. Asuka had said it. She slapped her palm into her face.

“You made me say it, Wondergirl.”

“What?”

“Don’t act innocent.”

“I do not know what you are talking about. Did I do something wrong?” But she was smiling.

"明日香，"丽说，就像在试探。"明日香"

"看到了吗？没那么糟。 丽。”

"还是很奇怪 直呼别人的名字。”

"但这是朋友该做的 你也可以叫得可爱些。日语有很多叫法，但......"

朋友。 明日香说出来了。她用手掌拍了拍自己的脸

"是你逼我说的，优等生"

"什么？"

"别装无辜。"

"我不知道你在说什么。我做错什么了吗？" 但是她在笑。

“You know exactly what you did! You’re so lame.”

A magazine Rei had been reading had fallen to the floor and Asuka stooped down to pick it up.

“See? You’re reading Misato’s trashy magazines. You’re going to be a normal, boring girl before long.”

"你很清楚你做了什么 你太逊了。"

丽正在看的一本杂志掉到了地上，明日香弯腰捡了起来。

"看吧，你在看美里的垃圾杂志。过不了多久，你就会变成一个普通而无聊的女孩了。"

“Are you a normal, boring girl?”

“Me? Of course not!”

“Do you read magazines?”

“Well, yeah, sometimes.”

"你是个普通无聊的女孩吗？"

"我当然不是！"

"你看杂志吗？"

"嗯，是的，有时候看"

The red eyes stared at her, unblinking.

“Oh, forget it.”

“You’re not lonely,” Rei said as she started to leave. Asuka froze.

“No. No, I’m not. Not anymore.” She licked her lips and sighed. “You won’t be either. We’re all together. For now. It’s… kind of nice.”

红色的眼睛一眨不眨地盯着她。

"哦，算了吧。"

"你并不孤单。"丽边说边开始离开。明日香愣住了。

"不，不，我不寂寞。不再寂寞了。" 她舔了舔嘴唇，叹了口气。"你也不会了。我们都在一起。暂时如此。这......挺好的。"

“Ikari takes good care of you.”

Asuka slid her arms around her body, hugging herself.

“Yeah. Yeah, he does.”

“Have you forgiven him?”

“I don’t know. Maybe.”

“You mentioned that he was going to give you a present.”

“Did I? I must have forgotten.”

“It was only a few days ago. You were very excited.” Rei’s lips started to curve once more. “You seemed happy.”

"碇君把你照顾得很好。"

明日香双手环抱着自己的身体，搂着自己。

"嗯嗯，他照顾得很好"

"你原谅他了吗？"

"我不知道 也许吧"

"你说过他要送你礼物"

"我有吗？我一定是忘了。"

"就在几天前 你当时非常激动。" 丽的嘴角再次弯了起来。"你看起来很开心"

~

The day before Rei left the hospital, they had switched up their routine so that Shinji could go find Asuka a belated Christmas present. This had caused him no small amount of stress.

“I don’t think I’ve ever bought a girl a present. I don’t know that I’ve ever gotten a present for anyone,” he admitted to Misato one evening at the hospital.

丽离开医院的前一天，他们改变了作息时间，以便让真嗣去给明日香找一份迟到的圣诞礼物。这给他带来了不小的压力。

"我想我从来没有给女孩买过礼物。我不知道我有没有为任何人买过礼物。"一天晚上，他在医院向美里承认。

“Well, at least you don’t have to buy her a present. So you can really go all out.” Misato sighed. They sat together in the small café at the end of the hallway, which was where Shinji did dishes each evening and then made Misato coffee. At her request, he had stashed a bottle of Irish whiskey in the café’s kitchen to spike her coffee. Asuka, in her newfound medical zeal, had declared that Misato couldn’t drink while on duty, so she had to get her fix on the sly. “It’s funny. Regular material goods don’t really hold much attraction for me these days. Once upon a time, I would have raided the department stores downtown but now, it just doesn’t seem worth it. I should go before more people come back and snatch up the good stuff.”

"好吧，至少你不用花钱给她买礼物。 所以你真的可以全力以赴。" 美里叹了口气。他们一起坐在走廊尽头的小咖啡馆里，每天晚上，真嗣都会在这里洗碗，然后给美里煮咖啡。应她的要求，他在咖啡馆的厨房里藏了一瓶爱尔兰威士忌，用来给她的咖啡加料。明日香热衷于医学，宣布美里在值班时不能喝酒，所以她只能偷偷地喝。"这很有趣。现在普通的物质生活对我来说已经没有什么吸引力了。以前，我会去市中心的百货商店大肆采购，但现在，似乎不值得了。我该走了，免得更多的人回来抢购好东西。"

“Maybe it’s just not valuable without money,” Shinji mused. “But there’s value in liking how you look.”

“True,” Misato nodded. She started to speak, paused, and set her mug down. “Does Asuka like the way she looks?”

"也许没有钱就没有价值，"真嗣喃喃自语。"但是，有没有价值的取决于你怎么看。"

"没错。"美里点点头。她刚想说话，顿了顿，放下了杯子。"那明日香喜欢看她现在的样子吗？"

“What? I think so. I don’t know.”

He blushed under Misato’s gaze.

“I think she does sometimes,” he admitted. “But other times, I know she doesn’t.”

“I’ve tried to talk to her about it. The scarring. But she’s so sensitive.”

"什么？ 我想我不知道。"

在美里的注视下，他脸红了。

"我想她有时会在意，"他承认道，"但其他时候，我知道她不会。"

"我试过跟她谈起这件事。但她太敏感那些伤疤 了.”

Asuka. Sensitive. Shinji almost laughed. But he knew Misato was right. If anything, that was something he’d realized that he liked. Even—loved. She was never passive or numb. Everything made her come alive, for better or for worse.

明日香是敏感的人。真嗣差点笑出声来。但他知道美里是对的。如果有的话，那就是他意识到自己喜欢的东西—两个人之间的爱 。她从不被动或麻木 。无论好坏，一切都让她充满活力。

“I try to tell her that I think she’s beautiful. But if I say it too much, she thinks I’m pitying her and that’s even worse than if I’d called her ugly.”

“I understand. What you need is a way to show her that you think she’s beautiful.” Misato clucked her tongue. “Hey, Shinji. When you two are—together—intimately—does she always turn the lights off?”

"我试着告诉她，我觉得她很漂亮。但如果我说得太多 她就会觉得我在可怜她 这比我说她丑更糟糕"

"我理解。你需要的是一种方法，让她知道你觉得她很漂亮。" 美里吐了吐舌头。"嘿，真嗣。你们俩在一起的亲热的时候， 她总是关灯吗？"

He blushed and stammered out a reply. “Yeah, I guess.”

“Or does she keep her clothes on sometimes?”

“Um, yes.”

“You know her sizes and stuff, right? For clothes?”

“Um, yes.”

“Nothing tells a woman ‘I like your body and I want to see it’ like lingerie.”

他红着脸，结结巴巴地回答道。"是的，我想是的"

"或者她有时会穿着衣服？"

"嗯，是的"

"你知道她衣服的尺码什么的吧？对吧？"

"是的。"

"没有什么比内衣更能告诉女人 "我喜欢你的身体，我想看看"

He turned as red as LCL and it was several minutes before Misato could pry an intelligible response out of him.

“Here,” she said, finally, tearing off a piece of paper and scribbling a name on it. “This is my favorite boutique. They’ll have something nice. Classy but… You know. Not too classy. Do you understand?”

He nodded furiously and plucked the slip out of her hands like a precious treasure that could be stolen at any moment.

他的脸变得像 LCL 一样红，过了好几分钟，美里才从他口中撬出一个能听懂的回答。

"给，"她终于说，撕下一张纸，在上面潦草地写了一个名字。"这是我最喜欢的精品店。他们会有一些好东西。高档的东西，但......你知道。不要太高档。你明白吗？"

他疯狂地点点头，从她手中夺走了那张纸条，就像夺走了一件随时可能被偷走的珍宝。

“This is a joke,” Asuka whispered when she opened the box. The cheery wrapping paper lay like shed skin on the floor around her. They sat together in an empty hospital room. Shinji hadn’t wanted to give it to her there, considering their history with hospital rooms, but she had been insistent in her excitement. Now, he wished he’d waited till they were alone at the apartment. At least they weren’t on Rei’s floor. “You bastard. I can’t wear this. What the hell are you doing, idiot?”

"这是个玩笑，"明日香打开盒子时低声说道。充满节日气息的包装纸像脱落的皮肤一样铺在她周围的地板上。他们一起坐在空荡荡的病房里。考虑到他们在病房的过往，真嗣本不想在那里把礼物送给她，但她激动地一直坚持。现在，他真希望能等到他们在公寓里独处的时候。至少他们不要在丽的楼层。"你这个混蛋 。我不能穿这个。你到底在干什么？八嘎"

Her hands were trembling as she picked it up. It unfurled before her: a black, lace teddy. See-thru. With straps. It left approximately nothing to the imagination.

“Why did you give me this?”

“Because I want to see you wearing it,” he forced himself to say, keeping his voice from shaking.

拿起它时，她的手在颤抖。它在她面前展开：一件黑色的蕾丝泰迪熊睡衣。透视的。有肩带。它几乎没有任何遮挡让人浮想联翩。

"你为什么给我这个？"

"因为我想看你穿上它，"他强迫自己说，不让自己的声音颤抖。

“There’s no way you can want that.”

“Asuka.”

“My body is… My body isn’t…”

“Asuka.”

“I hate you. I take it all back. Don’t do this to me.”

"你想要那个没门！"

"明日香"

"我的身体... 我的身体不能..."

"明日香"

"我恨你 。我收回所有的话。 别这样对我.”

Maybe this had been a mistake. He was about to invoke Misato’s name but he decided that might only make her more upset.

“Um, you don’t have to wear it. But I thought it would look nice on you. Really.”

She swallowed hard.

也许这是个错误。他正想叫出美里的名字，但他觉得那可能只会让她更难过。

"嗯，你不必穿它。但我觉得你穿着会很好看。真的。"

她艰难地咽了口唾沫。

“I’m going to put it on,” she said. “And you’ll see how awful it looks.” She disappeared into the bathroom.

“I hate you,” she called out at one point. Shinji waited, perched on the edge of the bed, until finally she emerged, face downcast.

“Well?” she asked after a few seconds. “You can see everything. You already knew what it looked like. Why do you care?”

"我要穿上它，"她说。"你就会知道它有多难看" 她消失在浴室里

"我恨你，"她叫道。真嗣趴在床边等着，直到她终于走出来，面无表情。

"怎么样？"几秒钟后，她问道。"你可以看到一切。你已经知道它长什么样了。你为什么要在乎呢？"

“You’re really sexy,” he said, and she turned her face away. “Scars and all.”

“Idiot. Asshole. I hate you.”

“Really.”

“Don’t make fun of me.”

“I’m not making fun of you.”

She let herself be drawn into his arms.

"你真的很性感，"他说，她转过脸去。"不管是伤痕还是其他的"

"八嘎。混蛋。 我恨你.”

"真的"

"别取笑我"

"我没有取笑你"

她任由他将自己揽入怀中

“I feel like I have scales. These things all over me. I don’t even feel human. How can you like this?”

“Asuka, you look great. You always have. And you always will.”

“I won’t, when I’m old. That’s how I know you’re a liar.” She reached for his crotch. “Fine. You’re just so horny you’ll screw anything that moves. You’re a teenage boy after all. Or maybe it’s because we’re on a hospital bed.” He winced and she sighed, wiping her eyes with her fingers. “Sorry.”

"我觉得我身上伤疤像鳞片一样。 我浑身都是这些东西。 我都不觉得自己是人了 你怎么会喜欢这样？"

"明日香，你看起来棒极了。你一直都很漂亮。以后都会很漂亮。”

"等我老了就不会了。 所以我知道你是个骗子。" 她把手伸向他的裤裆。 "好吧。 你只是太饥渴了，什么东西都想上。毕竟你还是个十几岁的孩子。也可能是因为我们都有病。"（双关） 他抽噎了一下，而她叹了口气，用手指擦了擦眼睛。"对不起。"

They climbed into the bed and he held her under the sheets.

“Thank you,” she said after a few minutes. “It’s a pretty good gift.”

“I, uh, saw some other stuff that I liked too.”

“Yeah?” she asked, her voice tight and breathy.

“You could try it on.”

“Would you like that?”

“Uh-huh.”

“Then maybe, if you’re lucky, I’ll consider it.”

他们爬上床，他在床单下抱着她。

"谢谢你，"几分钟后她说 "这是份不错的礼物"

"我，呃，还看到了其他一些我喜欢的东西。"

"是吗？"她问，声音紧促而喘息。

"你可以试穿一下。"

"你喜欢吗？"

"嗯哼"

"如果你幸运的话，我可以考虑一下"

She rolled over on top of him and started to tug away his shirt.

“See, if I had been awake,” she murmured in between kisses. “Wait, this is nice, so I want to take it off. So it doesn’t get messed up.”

“If it gets messed up, I’ll wash it. Or get you a new one.”

She paused, straddling his hips and fingering the fine fabric.

“Okay. Then let’s mess it up.”

她翻身压在他身上，开始扯开他的衬衫。

"看，如果我醒着的话，"她在亲吻间喃喃地说。"等等，这样很好，所以我想把它脱掉。这样就不会弄脏了。"

"如果弄脏了，我会洗的。或者给你买件新的。"

她停顿了一下，跨坐在他的臀部上，用手指着细布料。

"好吧，那我们就把它弄乱。"

Asuka stuck her nose in the air.

“Rei, it is absolutely none of your business what Shinji got me.”

“You’ve also seemed happy since,” Rei added as the red-haired girl stalked into the hallway. “It wasn’t what I thought he was going to give you.”

Asuka’s head popped back into her room:

“What are you talking about?”

“I helped him pick something else out.”

明日香的鼻子慢慢先伸了出来。

"丽，真嗣送我的东西绝对不关你的事。"

"从那以后，你看起来也很开心。"当红发女孩步入走廊时，丽补充道。"那不是我以为他会给你的东西。"

明日香的头突然回到了丽的房间：

"你在说什么？"

"我帮他挑了别的东西。"

“You’ve barely left the apartment.” She waited for Rei to defend herself. “What is it?”

“It is not for me to say.”

“Oh, you’re so lame.”

"你几乎没离开过房间" 她等着丽为自己答疑。"是什么东西？"

"这不应该由我说出来。"

"哦，你真没劲"

~

And like that, the quiet days resumed. Winter had descended in full force, and they played in the snow outside, warmed themselves with hot tea inside, and continued to wait. Gradually, they moved to grocery stores further and further away to pillage their favorite frozen and dried foods. They’d all started to crave fresh fruit and vegetables but there was no question of having any of that until at least the summer. Shinji found a book on farming, of all things, and spent long hours drawing out a diagram of what to plant in the field in front of the apartment block.

就这样，平静的日子又开始了。冬天来临了，他们在外面玩雪，在屋里喝热茶取暖，继续等待。渐渐地，他们来到越来越远的杂货店，购买他们最喜欢的冷冻食品和干货。他们都开始渴求新鲜的水果和蔬菜，但至少要等到夏天才能吃到。真嗣找到了一本关于农业的书，他花了很长时间在公寓楼前的田地里画出了要种植什么的示意图。

What became clear to all of that, almost immediately, was that Rei had no idea how to live with other people. The social situations she’d been privy to as an EVA pilot had been so limited and while Misato suspected that she was enrolled in school precisely in order to dull some of her sharp edges, her awkwardness was all the more salient now. She’d wander into Shinji and Asuka’s room as soon as she awoke in the morning to greet them, and when they asked her not to do this, she responded by staying in her room till late afternoon.

几乎是一瞬间，所有的人都意识到，丽根本不知道如何与他人相处。作为一名 EVA 驾驶员，她能接触到的社交场合非常有限，虽然美里怀疑她上学的目的正是为了磨掉一些锋利的棱角，但她的笨拙现在更加突出了。早上一醒来，她就会跑到真嗣和明日香的房间向他们问好，当他们要求她不要这样做时，她的回答是在房间里待到傍晚。

Often, she picked one of them to follow around all day. Shinji was the most tolerant of this attention: Rei’s silent observation ultimately didn’t bother him, and she seemed content to watch him practice cello for hours, read for hours, play video games for hours, even cook—he had started to teach her some basic recipes after realizing that, while living alone, she had subsisted solely on convenience store instant meals.

她经常挑其中一个人整天跟着。真嗣最能忍受这种关注： 丽的默默观察最终没有打扰到他，她似乎很满足于看他练习大提琴几个小时、看书几个小时、玩电子游戏几个小时，甚至做饭--在意识到她独自生活时只能靠便利店的速食来维持生计后，他开始教她一些基本食谱。

Predictably, Asuka could only tolerate Rei’s presence for twenty minutes or so at a time. If she felt red eyes watching her, she’d begin to prickle and look for an escape route, sometimes taking refuge in the bathroom, only to find Rei waiting for her when she emerged.

可想而知，明日香每次只能忍受丽二十分钟左右。如果她感觉到有一双红色的眼睛在注视着她，她就会开始浑身发痒，并寻找逃跑的路线，有时会躲进浴室，但当她出来时却发现丽正在等着她。

“You just need to find ways to involve her,” Misato told her when she complained. “She’s never had friends before. She doesn’t really know what to do with her friends.”

“But! She’s—like—“ and here Asuka dropped her voice. “The mother of humanity or something. She should have better social skills.”

“A few years with NERV screwed you up,” Misato pointed out, hotly. “She’s never known anything but NERV.”

"你只需要想办法让她参与进来，"美里在她抱怨时告诉她。"她以前从来没有过朋友。她不知道该怎么和朋友相处"

"但是！她就像--"明日香说到这里，声音小了下来。"人类之母什么的。她应该有更好的社交技巧。"

"在 NERV 工作的几年把你搞得一团糟，"美里火冒三丈地指出。"除了 NERV 她什么都不知道"

Slightly ashamed (though she’d never admit it), Asuka made a point to invite Rei to an arcade later the afternoon, where they played videogames in silence until they ran out of change. Under Asuka’s instructions, Rei had brought a hammer and they smashed open a few games they weren’t interested in and stole coins out of them.

明日香略感羞愧（虽然她从不承认），于是她特意邀请丽在下午晚些时候去了一家游戏厅，他们在那里默默地玩电子游戏，直到零钱用完为止。在明日香的指点下，丽带来了一把锤子，他们砸开了几款他们不感兴趣的游戏机，从里面偷走了硬币。

“You know, when more people come back, we can’t do things like that. People don’t like it when you steal and smash things.”

“But we do that all the time. Even Ikari does.”

“But that’s because we’re the only ones here. As long as it’s just us, and it’s not our stuff, it’s fine, but we’ll need to be more careful when people we don’t know come back.”

The red eyes stared at her. Damn it.

"你知道，当更多的人回来时， 我们不能做这样的事情。人们不喜欢你偷东西和砸东西"

"但我们一直都这么做 就连碇君也是

"那是因为这里只有我们。只要这个世界只有我们，那拿不是我们的东西就不是问题，但当我们不认识的人回来时，我们就需要更加小心了。"

红色的眼睛盯着她。该死的

“I mean, we can really only trust each other, right? After everything we’ve been through. We all know what happened but other people won’t and they won’t have any reason to trust us either.”

“You’re a very suspicious person.”

"我是说，我们真的只能互相信任，对吗？我们经历了这么多 我们都知道发生了什么 但其他人不知道 他们也没有理由相信我们"

"你真是个多疑的人"

“That’s just the way the world works!” Asuka cried and kicked a broken arcade machine. “People will try to take advantage of you if you let them. You need to learn that, if you’re going to live in this world. We might not always be around to make sure you don’t get into trouble.”

"世界就是这样！" 明日香哭着踢了一脚坏掉的游戏机。"如果你听之任之，人们就会想方设法占你便宜。如果你要生活在这个世界上，就必须学会这一点。我们可能不会一直在你身边，确保你不会惹上麻烦。"

The eyes blinked and drifted to the floor. The rest of Rei’s face didn’t change.

“Sorry. I’m not mad, you know.”

“You act mad.”

“I know. I’m mad a lot. But I’m working on it.”

眼睛眨了眨，飘到了地上。丽的表情没有任何变化。

"对不起 我没有生气，你知道的。"

"你表现得很生气。"

"我知道。我经常生气。但我正在努力

“You’re happy a lot, but you keep it a secret because you’re afraid if you admit to it, it’ll go away.” Asuka’s mouth dropped open and her hands curled into fists. “Because you think you can’t lose something you don’t have.”

“This is an obnoxious habit of yours.”

“Oh?”

“Don’t psychoanalyze people without their permission.”

"你很快乐，但你一直瞒着自己，因为你害怕一旦承认，快乐就会消失。" 明日香张大了嘴，双手握成了拳头。"因为你觉得你不能失去你没有的东西。"

"这是你令人讨厌的习惯。"

"哦？"

"不要在没有得到别人允许的情况下对别人进行心理分析。"

“I,” Rei said, coolly, which was how she said everything, Asuka realized. “Am only stating the obvious.”

Rei knelt and gathered a few handfuls of coins. She went back to the game she’d been playing and scattered the coins over the machine’s controls. Asuka heard the soft clink of coins dropping into the machine.

“Ikari feels like he’s failing you, because he thinks you’re not happy.”

“I’m almost wish we’d left you by the side of the road.”

"我，"丽冷冷地说，明日香意识到，她就是这样说一切的。"我只是在陈述显而易见的事实。"

丽跪在地上，捡起几把硬币。她回到刚才玩的游戏中，把硬币撒在机器的控制器上。明日香听到了硬币落入机器的叮当声。

"碇君觉得他辜负了你， 因为他觉得你不快乐。"

"我真希望我们把你丢在路边。"

“That’s not true. Saving my life made you feel competent and important. Moreover, you often enjoy my company, even though you will not admit it.”

“You’re so lame.” Asuka stooped to collect some coins for herself and when she saw her reflection in one of the dead, grey arcade screens, she was half-amazed to see a grin on her face.

“Hey,” she said, approaching Rei. The other girl didn’t look away from the arcade screen but grunted in acknowledgement. “Rei, when I was leaving the LCL, I asked if you were God. And you said you didn’t know. Do you know now?”

"不是这样的。救了我的命让你觉得自己很有能力，也很重要。而且，你经常喜欢和我在一起，尽管你不承认。"

"你真没劲。" 明日香弯腰为自己捡了一些硬币，当她看到自己倒影在其中一个死气沉沉的灰色街机屏幕上时，她半信半疑地看到了自己脸上的笑容。

"嘿，"她走近丽说。另一个女孩没有把目光从街机屏幕上移开，而是咕哝了一声表示感谢。"丽，当我离开 LCL 的时候，我问你是不是上帝。你说你不知道。你现在知道了吗？"

“No. I am not God.”

“Good. You said something else though.”

“Forget it, Second Child. Asuka.”

“No, what was it?”

“It is not important.”

"不，我不是上帝"

"那就好 不过你还说了些别的。"

"算了吧，二号机驾驶员。 明日香。"

"不，是什么？"

"这不重要"

“So tell me then. It was something like—‘the truth is more complicated and frightening.’ What’s the truth, then? Seriously, nothing scares me anymore.”

“There are other reactions,” Rei said. “Besides fear.”

“It’d better not be something lame. Like Pen-Pen is God. Or Misato.”

“No. I highly doubt that either of them is God.”

“Do you know?” Asuka furrowed her brow. “Hey, look at me. You’re being weirder than usual.”

“I am playing my game.”

"那就告诉我吧。是这样的--'真相更复杂、更可怕'。那真相是什么？说真的，我已经什么都不怕了。"

"还有其他反应。"丽说。"除了恐惧。"

"最好不是什么蹩脚的东西。比如Pen-Pen是神。或者美里。"

"不，我非常怀疑他们中的任何一个是神。"

"你知道吗？" 明日香皱起了眉头。"嘿，看着我。你比平时更古怪了。"

"我在玩我的游戏。"

“In order to avoid talking to me. I’m, like, the queen of that move.” Asuka batted her hands away and Rei’s character died in an instant. “Tell me what you figured out.”

“I didn’t figure out anything. When I told you that, I didn’t believe we would ever speak again.”

“So why is it different now?”

“Because I don’t want anything to change.”

"为了不和我说话 。我可是专治这一招的女王。" 明日香把她的手拍开，丽的角色瞬间夭折。"告诉我你发现了什么？"

"我什么都没想出来。当我告诉你的时候，我不相信我们还会再说话。"

"那为什么现在不一样了？"

"因为我不想有任何改变"

“Rei,” Asuka whispered. She gripped the other girl’s shoulders, turned her to look her in the eye. “If what you figured out will change things—you have to tell me.”

“No. No, I do not. I’m not a doll—I can make my own decisions.”

“Yes, obviously,” Asuka cried, shaking her. “But look, if we’re friends—we can’t keep secrets. We need to trust one another, okay? You need to tell me if something is going to happen or if there’s something we need to be worried about.”

"丽，"明日香低声说道。她抓住另一个女孩的肩膀，转过身来看着她的眼睛。"如果你发现的事情会改变一切，你必须告诉我。"

"不，不，我不说。我不是洋娃娃，我可以自己做决定。"

"是的，很明显。"明日香哭着摇晃她。"但是听着，如果我们是朋友，我们就不能保守秘密。我们需要彼此信任，好吗？如果有什么事情要发生，或者有什么我们需要担心的事情，你需要告诉我。"

“It’s nothing to worry about. It’s nothing we can change.”

“Scheiβe. You’re impossible.”

“If I tell you, you must promise that nothing will change.”

“Idiot, how can I promise that? You know I won’t promise that.”

“Yes. I know.” She looked away from Asuka for a second, focusing on a buzzing arcade machine in the corner. “If I tell you, Ikari should also be there.”

"没什么好担心的 这不是我们能改变的

"狗屎。 你真是不可理喻

"如果我告诉你，你必须保证什么都不会改变"

"傻瓜，我怎么能保证？你知道我不会答应的

"是的，我知道。" 她把目光从明日香身上移开，盯着角落里嗡嗡作响的街机。"如果我告诉你，碇君也应该在这里。"

They agreed to reconvene at Rei’s old apartment, since she wanted help going through her old things. She’d mostly been borrowing Asuka’s clothes and it drove Asuka nuts if she couldn’t find a specific item, only to see Rei wearing it later in the day. Not that the First Child had much in the way of clothes. Asuka wasn’t sure if she’d ever seen her wear something besides a plug suit or her school uniform.

因为丽想让人帮忙整理她的旧物，所以她们约定在丽的旧公寓再次见面。她大部分时间都在借明日香的衣服穿，如果明日香找不到某件特定的衣服，后来却看到丽在穿这件衣服，这让明日香很抓狂。因为丽的衣服并不多。明日香不确定自己是否曾见过她穿除了驾驶服或校服以外的衣服。

“I’m sure it won’t be a big deal,” Shinji said when Asuka went home to collect him.

“I don’t know about that. She seemed kind of freaked out. As freaked out as Rei can get.”

“But how bad can it be? There are no more Angels, no more EVAs.”

"我相信不会有什么大问题的。"真嗣说，当明日香回家整理旧物时。

"这我就不知道了。她看起来有点吓坏了。就像丽那样吓坏了。"

"但情况能有多糟呢？没有使徒，没有EVA了"

Asuka dashed around their room, stuffing things into a bag—a notebook, pens, manga, his SDAT player, snacks. It was only when Shinji placed his arms around her that she slowed to a halt and took a shuddering breath.

明日香在他们的房间里四处乱跑，往包里塞东西--笔记本、笔、漫画、SDAT播放器和零食。直到真嗣用手搂住她，她才缓过神来，颤抖地吸了一口气。

“I’m scared,” she admitted.

“We’re not going to run away from this,” he whispered. “Whatever it is, we can handle it.”

“When did you get so brave?”

"我害怕，"她承认。

"我们不会逃避的，"他低声说。"不管是什么，我们都能应付。"

"你什么时候变得这么勇敢了？"

“It’s easy. All I have to do is be brave for a few minutes and then you take over and I can go back to being a coward.”

She reached for his hair, dug her nails into his scalp, as if holding on.

“You’re not going to leave me.”

“Never.”

“Idiot. You’re fifteen. Don’t make promises like that.”

"这很简单 我只需要勇敢几分钟 然后你接手 我就可以继续当懦夫了"

她伸手抓住他的头发 把指甲抠进他的头皮里 好像要把他抓牢一样

"你不会离开我的"

"永远不会"

"傻瓜 你才十五岁。不要做这样的承诺。"

“Mein Gott, what a dump!” Asuka gasped. “Nerv couldn’t have sprung for something nicer?”

“It really hasn’t changed a bit,” Shinji sighed, setting down his bag.

“You’ve seen her apartment before?”

“Ikari visited me several times here.”

"我的天哪，真是个垃圾场！" 明日香喘着气说。"Nerv就不能做点好事吗？"

"真的一点都没变。"真嗣叹了口气，放下了包。

"你以前见过她的公寓？"

"碇君来这里看过我几次。"

Why am I only hearing about this for the first time, Asuka wondered, looking from Shinji’s guilty face to Rei’s expressionless one.

“To drop things off,” he said. “Her NERV ID and stuff.”

“That was the day you found me naked and touched my breasts, was it not?” Rei asked. She blinked. “Ikari?”

明日香从真嗣心虚的脸看向丽面无表情的脸，不禁问道："为什么我才第一次听说这件事呢？

"去送东西。"他说。"她的NERV身份证之类的东西。"

"那天你发现我赤身裸体，还摸了我的胸部，是不是？" 丽问道。她眨了眨眼睛。"碇君？"

“Shinji!” Asuka screeched. “What the hell?”

“I thought you knew about that! From Instrumentality!”

“Sorry, but I didn’t catalogue every one of your intimate moments with Rei! And you—you’re enjoying this too much,” she said, jabbing a finger at the blue-haired girl who almost smiled in return.

"真嗣！" 明日香尖叫道 "搞什么鬼？"

"你不是知道吗？从补完里！"

"对不起，我没有把你和丽的亲密时刻一一记录下来！而且你--你也太享受了。"说着，她用手指戳了戳蓝发女孩，后者几乎是笑着回敬的。

“I thought I might lighten the mood first,” she said. “Did I fail?”

“No, it’s fine, Ayanami—but—“

“Yes,” Rei sighed. She folded her hands. “Shortly after Third Impact, I began to suspect that the Human Instrumentality Project had failed. Completely. That Third Impact had failed. Utterly. Resulting in the complete extermination of the human species.”

"我想我可以先缓和一下气氛，"她说。"我失败了吗？"

"没有，很好，绫波，但是......"

"是的。"丽叹了口气。她双手合十。"在第三次冲击之后不久，我开始怀疑人类补完计划已经失败了。完全失败了。第三次冲击失败了。彻底失败了。导致人类彻底灭绝"

She allowed this to sink in.

“But that’s obviously not true,” Shinji started. “Because we’re here.”

“Are we?” Rei asked.

“Yes,” Asuka scowled. “We are. I can feel this chair, I can feel the floor, and I can feel the clothes on my body. And I can think. Here I am, thinking about thinking. Cogito ergo sum. I think, therefore I exist.”

她听得津津有味。

"但这显然不是真的，"真嗣开始说。"因为我们在这里。"

"是吗？" 丽问道。

"是的。"明日香皱起了眉头。"我们在这里。我能感觉到这把椅子，我能感觉到地板，我能感觉到身上的衣服。我还能思考。我在这里，思考着思考。Cogito ergo sum. 我思故我在"

“Or are you a projection of thinking? A dream someone else might be having.”

No one spoke for several moments.

“Who?” Asuka asked, finally.

Rei turned to Shinji.

“No,” Asuka said.

“Yui Ikari foresaw this possibility. As a failsafe against any cataclysmic events resulting from the Angels, or SEELE’s interventions, or her husband’s, she saw to it that EVA Unit 1 would act as a kind of evacuation vessel. For you, Shinji Ikari.”

"或者你是思维的投影？一个别人可能正在做的梦。"

好一会儿没人说话。

"谁？" 明日香终于开口问道。

丽转向真嗣。

"不，"明日香说。

"碇唯预见到了这种可能性。为了防止因使徒、SEELE的干预或她丈夫的干预而引发任何灾难性事件，她决定让EVA 初号机充当一种明日方舟。"为了你—碇真嗣。"

“So, what you’re saying,” Shinji began.

“No. No. No. No. No. No.”

“I believe it is more likely than not that this reality is simply a dream of Ikari’s. Only the people most important to him have returned, and this reality enacts scenarios in which he can find solace and redemption for his past transgressions（过犯）, both real and perceived.”

“No. That’s impossible,” Asuka moaned. “That’s not fair.”

"那么，你想说什么？"真嗣开口了。

"不，不，不，不，不，不。"

"我认为，更有可能的是，这个现实只是碇君的一个梦。只有对他来说最重要的人才回来了，而这个现实中的场景可以让他为自己过去的过失找到慰藉和救赎，无论是真实的还是感知到的。"

"不，这不可能。"明日香呻吟道。"这不公平。"

“For instance,” Rei continued. “Ikari achieved reconciliation with you, though not without enormous pain. He is a fundamentally masochistic individual or, more accurately, he struggles to believe that he is worthy of love without first experiencing extraordinary suffering.”（-这也太直白了）

"例如，"丽继续说道。"碇君实现了与你的和解，但也经历了巨大的痛苦。他从根本上说是一个受虐狂，或者更准确地说，他努力相信，在经历非同寻常的痛苦后，他是值得被爱的。

“That might be true, but that doesn’t mean we’re—fake.”

“We’re not fake,” Rei said, shaking her head. “We exist in his dreaming mind. Perhaps. I’m not sure. There’s a distinct possibility that I’m wrong, and this reality is… real. Outside of Ikari’s mind, I mean.”

“Ayanami, is there a way we can know for certain?” Shinji asked once they’d all stared at their shoes for several minutes. “Like—something Asuka knows that I don’t know.”

"这也许是真的，但这并不意味着我们是假的。"

"我们不是假的。"丽摇着头说。"我们存在于他的梦境中。也许吧。我不确定。很有可能我错了，我是说，在碇君的大脑之外，这个现实是......真实的。"

"绫波，我们有办法确定吗？" 当他们都盯着自己的鞋子看了几分钟之后，真嗣问道。"比如明日香知道一些我不知道的事。"

“Right,” Asuka said fiercely, looking up. “Shinji—“ and she recited:

Freude, schöner Götterfunken,

Tochter aus Elysium!

Wir betreten feuertrunken,

Himmlische, Dein Heiligthum.

“Um,” he said. “That’s the text of the Ode to Joy. I do know that.”

“Fine—can you translate it?”

"对，"明日香抬起头，狠狠地说。"真嗣--"她念道：

Freude, schöner Götterfunken,

Tochter aus Elysium,

Wir betreten feuertrunken,

Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!

他说 "这是《欢乐颂》的歌词。我知道

"好吧，你能翻译一下吗？"

“No.”

“’Joy, beautiful spark of the Gods, daughter of Elysium. We enter, burning with fervor, your sanctuary, oh Divine.’”

She waited. Shinji shrugged.

“So, that proves it. We’re real. This is all real.”

"不行"

"欢乐女神圣洁美丽，灿烂光芒照大地！我们心中充满热情，来到你的圣殿里。"

她在等待。真嗣耸了耸肩。

"那么，这就证明了。我们是真实的。这一切都是真实的。"

“Those words and that translation could be made up entirely,” Rei pointed out. “And the history of the world in this reality transformed to fit them, to maintain the illusion.”

“What else can we do then?”

Rei shrugged.

“Nothing. There is a chance that we may fade away from this world, I suppose, if Ikari starts to forget us.”

"这些词和翻译可能完全是编造出来的，"丽指出。"这个现实世界的历史也会随之改变，以适应它们，维持假象。"

"那我们还能做什么呢？"

丽耸了耸肩。

"什么也做不了。我想，如果碇君开始忘记我们的话，我们有可能会从这个世界上消失。"

She’d been looking at her hands, as had Shinji, but they both looked up when Asuka let out a sob.

“Rei, this isn’t fair. I was—I was happy, damn it.” Shinji came for her but she pushed him off. “Rei, tell me the truth.”

“This is the truth. As far as I can tell. There is fundamental uncertainty built into this proposition, of course.”

她和真嗣一样，一直在看着自己的手，但当明日香发出一声啜泣时，他们都抬起了头。

"丽，这不公平。我本来很高兴的，该死的。" 真嗣过来拉她，但被她推开了。"丽，告诉我真相"

"这就是真相。就我所知。当然，这个命题有根本的不确定性。"

“This is going to drive me insane. Rei, please—“

“I asked you to promise that this would change nothing. Do you understand why now?”

“Rei—“

“I, too, am dismayed at this idea.”

"这会让我发疯的 丽，求你了

"我让你保证这不会改变任何事 你现在明白为什么了吗？"

"丽—"

"我也对这个想法感到沮丧"

Asuka burst from her seat and suddenly, her hands were around Rei’s throat. The red eyes blinked at her but Rei offered no resistance as Asuka choked her.

“No, Asuka!” Shinji was crying behind her, trying to pull her away but whenever he pried a hand off Rei, Asuka jabbed him in the mouth and grabbed the tender white throat before her once more.

“Don’t take this from me, Rei. You bitch. You bitch. I should have let you die. If I’d let you die, maybe I could be happy. I was almost happy, Shinji. I was happy. I was getting happy. We were happy. But it was all smoke and mirrors.”

明日香突然从座位上站起来，双手扼住了丽的喉咙。明日香掐着丽的脖子，红色的眼睛眨也不眨地看着她，丽没有任何反抗。

"不，明日香！" 真嗣在她身后哭喊着，试图把她拉开，但每当他从丽身上撬开一只手时，明日香就会戳他的嘴，并再次掐住她面前嫩白的喉咙。

"别夺走我的东西，丽。你这个婊子。你这个婊子。我本该让你死的。如果我让你死了，也许我会快乐。我差点就幸福了，真嗣 。我很快乐 。我越来越开心了。 我们曾经幸福过。 "但这一切都是烟雾和镜花水月。"

Rei’s hand drifted through the air, touched Asuka’s cheek.

I hate this, she thought as she let go. She sank to her knees, covered her face, let the tears overflow. Shinji was holding her and crying too, and Rei cleared her throat a few times.

“I don’t feel well,” Rei murmured.

丽的手在空中飘荡，抚摸着明日香的脸颊。

她松开手时想，我讨厌这样。她跪在地上，捂着脸，任泪水溢出。真嗣抱着她也哭了起来，丽清了清嗓子。

"kimojiwarui，"丽喃喃地说。（一定是这个词！(/▽＼)

Half an hour later, everyone had calmed down or, more accurately, exhausted themselves with crying. There came a point, Asuka reflected, where tears were no longer enough. Where they began to feel like a caricature of sorrow. When you’ve already cried and mourned so much that to cry more feels odd, unnecessary, even distasteful.

半小时后，每个人都平静了下来，或者更准确地说，哭得筋疲力尽。明日香反思道，到了某一时刻，眼泪已经不够用了。泪水开始让人感觉像是悲伤的漫画。当你已经哭了那么多，哀悼了那么多，再哭就会觉得很奇怪，没有必要，甚至令人厌恶。

“Rei,” Shinji asked. His arms were around both of them. They’d all ended up on Rei’s bed, staring at the ceiling—sickly white tiles that seemed ready to fall on them at any moment—with Shinji between the two girls. Asuka wasn’t enthused by this configuration, but she recognized, even on the fringes of jealousy, that Rei resting her head on Shinji’s chest in a mirror image of Asuka’s own face pressed against his heart was the least of her worries right now. “What would happen if I died?”

"丽，"真嗣问道。他的双臂环抱着她们。他们最后都躺在丽的床上，凝视着天花板--令人作呕的白色瓷砖似乎随时都会掉下来砸到他们--真嗣在两个女孩中间。明日香并不喜欢这样的配置，但她认识到，即使是在嫉妒的边缘，丽把头靠在真嗣的胸膛上，就像明日香把自己的脸贴在他的心脏上一样，这是她现在最不需要担心的事情。"如果我死了会怎么样？"

“I, personally, would be quite sad.”

“I mean, if I’m dreaming all this and you’re just expressions of that dream.”

“I suppose… you would awaken. Perhaps. Perhaps you cannot die in this reality.” Rei lifted her head to look at both of them. “This is only one possibility. It’s not the only one.”

"我个人会非常难过"

"我是说，如果这一切都是我在做梦 而你只是梦境的表现形式"

"我想......你会醒来。也许吧 也许在这个现实中你不会死。" 丽抬起头看着他们俩。"这只是一种可能。这不是唯一的可能。"

“But you said you think it’s likely,” Asuka whisper-scowled.

“Yes. But many things that aren’t likely also happen,” Rei murmured. “The chances of all of our specific atoms coordinating into these organisms and meeting at this very moment, for instance, is infinitesimally unlikely and yet, it has happened.”

“Unless we’re a dream.”

“Yes. Unless we’re a dream,” Rei sighed. “But it would also hold true for our meeting before the dream. Unlikely things are still extremely possible, in the long run of existence.”

"但你说过你认为这很有可能。"明日香低声说道。

"是的，但很多不可能发生的事情也会发生。"丽喃喃地说。"比如说，我们所有的特定原子协调成这些有机体并在此刻相遇的可能性微乎其微，但它还是发生了。"

"除非我们是一场梦"

"是的，除非我们是一场梦。"丽叹了口气。"但这也适用于我们在梦境之前的相遇。从存在的长远角度来看，不可能的事情还是极有可能发生的。"

“I’m not concerned with the long run of existence, Wondergirl. I’m concerned with my own short, pitiful existence and whether or not it’s already ended and I’m just what Shinji thinks I sounded like when I existed.”

“I wish,” Rei said, her voice lowering. “That you would not call me ‘Wondergirl.’ It seems pejorative（贬义的）. We discussed calling one another by our first names and I have been doing that.”

"我并不关心存在的长河，优等生。 我关心的是自己短暂而可怜的存在，以及它是否已经结束，而我只是真嗣认为我存在时的样子。"

"我希望，"丽说，声音低了下去。"你不要叫我'优等生'。这似乎是贬义的。我们讨论过直呼彼此的名字，我一直在这么做"。

“It’s just a nickname, Ayanami,” Shinji said softly. “She doesn’t mean to be mean.”

“And yet, I’m always the bad guy,” Asuka grunted. “Rei.”

“I mean, this isn’t that much different from that old thought experiment. What if we’re just brains floating in some mad scientist’s lab, dreaming all of this? Right?” Shinji asked.

“Easy for you to say. You exist,” Asuka scowled.

"这只是个昵称，绫波。"真嗣轻声说。"她不是故意的。"

"然而，我总是坏人。"明日香咕哝道。"丽"

"我的意思是，这和那个古老的思想实验没什么区别。如果我们只是漂浮在某个疯狂科学家实验室里的缸中大脑，梦到了这一切呢？对吗？" 真嗣问道。

"你说得倒容易。你是存在的。"明日香皱眉道。

“That is not certain. Another distinct possibility, for example,” Rei offered. “Might be that we’re characters in some narrative. A piece of fiction. A manga or an anime. We only think and exist insofar as our creators allows us to, and it doesn’t seem odd to us when we do not, because we do not exist otherwise.”（-真相了，但是不能这样）

“I’ve never wanted one of Misato’s beers more,” Asuka whispered.

Rei reached for one of Asuka’s hands. Asuka stared at the pale fingers interweaving with hers. What was this? Not pity—Rei didn’t seem capable of pity yet. Pity was too advanced a social construct for her. It was comfort—even commiseration, which, it struck Asuka, was not nearly as complicated as pity because the conditions of degradation, humiliation, and general sorrow were so universal to all thinking creatures.

"这还不确定。比如说，还有一种明显的可能性，"丽说。"可能我们是某种叙事中的人物。一部小说。漫画或动画。我们只是在创作者允许的范围内思考和存在，当我们不这样做时，我们并不觉得奇怪，因为我们并不存在。"

"明日香低声说："我从来没有这么想喝美里的啤酒。

丽伸手握住明日香的一只手。明日香盯着与她交织在一起的苍白手指。这算什么？不是怜悯，丽似乎还没有怜悯的能力。对她来说，怜悯是一种太高级的社会结构。明日香觉得，这是一种安慰，甚至是同情，它并不像怜悯那么复杂，因为堕落、屈辱和普遍的悲哀是所有有思想的生物都会有的。

“I didn’t want to voice this to you,” she said, and with a sharp pang, Asuka realized she was crying. “We were having fun and I thought I could forget it too. I wanted to forget it. I almost did, some days. I’m sorry I could not—hold it in.”

“It’s not your fault, idiot.”

“I’m sorry,” Shinji whispered. “To both of you. If I’m doing this.”

“Idiot. You can’t help it either. Though—the fact that you’re snuggling with both of us and we’re just taking it really doesn’t make me optimistic that Rei’s wrong.”

Shinji started to sit up and take his arms away but both girls, as if they’d coordinated it, pulled him back down.（-左拥右抱的男人啊）

"我不想对你说这些，"她说，明日香猛地意识到自己哭了。"我们当时玩得很开心，我以为我也可以忘记这件事。我想忘记它。有些时候，我几乎做到了。对不起，我没能忍住。"

"这不是你的错，八嘎"

"对不起，"真嗣低声说 "如果你们是我的梦中人的话.”

"八嘎， 你也没办法。虽然你和我们两个依偎在一起，而我们只是接受它但这并不能让我乐观地认为丽是错的。"

真嗣刚想坐起来，把胳膊拿开，但两个女孩好像商量好了似的，又把他拉了回去。

~

“You guys were gone a while,” Misato chirped when the three teens arrived home. Her eyes passed over the red marks on Rei’s neck and a new bruise growing on Shinji’s chin. They settled on Asuka, eyes swollen and puffy. “Did… something happen?”

“Just… stuff,” Shinji said. Lame answer, Misato noted immediately.

“Huh. Stuff. Stuff I need to be worried about?”

The three of them parted, drifting to different areas of the apartment without saying anything. Only Shinji stood before her, head bowed.

“No. Not worried. Just…”

"你们去了好一会儿，"美里在三个孩子到家时叽叽喳喳地说。她的目光掠过丽脖子上的红印和真嗣下巴上新长出的淤青。她的目光落在明日香身上，她的眼睛红肿着。"发生了......什么事吗？"

"只是......有些事情，"真嗣说。美里立刻注意到了这个蹩脚的回答。

"嗯。我需要担心的事情？"

他们三人分开了，一言不发地飘向公寓的不同区域。只有真嗣站在她面前，低着头。

"不，不用担心。只是......"

For a second, it seemed as if he might cry. As if he had a load on his heart to spill and he was going to vomit it up to her. Misato wasn’t sure if she was ready for this, exactly—she’d printed out some four-hundred pages of SEELE correspondence which she was categorizing for posterity and the task was dismal, to say the least—but she braced herself for something awful.

“We all had a silly fight,” he sighed. “I think it’s my fault.”

“You already apologized?” Misato said. She didn’t need to ask, she mused, grinning.

“Of course.”

“Then that’s probably all you can do. Let them come around. Girls are sensitive.”

“I’m sensitive too,” Shinji sighed. “I kind of wish I weren’t. Some people manage to get by and barely feel anything, you know?”

有那么一瞬间，他好像要哭了。就好像他有心事要向她倾吐。而他要把它吐出来时，美里不确定自己是否已经做好了准备--她打印了大约四百页的 SEELE 通信，并将其归类以留存后世，至少可以说，这项任务是令人沮丧的--但她为可怕的事情做好了心理准备。

"我们都吵了一架，"他叹了口气。"我想这是我的错。"

"你已经道歉了？" 美里说。她不需要问，她喃喃地笑着。

"当然"

"那你能做的大概就只有这些了。让她们回心转意吧。女孩都很敏感。"

"我也很敏感。"真嗣叹了口气。"我有点希望自己不是这样。有些人能够勉强度日，几乎没有任何感觉，你知道吗？"

“Yeah, but feeling things doesn’t make you weak or anything. It’s just—a different kind of strength,” Misato said. “It might not seem like it now but some day, people will love you for it.”

Something prickled the back of Misato’s neck. Asuka, she realized, was watching both of them.

“Right, Asuka?”

“Exactly,” she grunted. “Shinji. Let’s go for a walk.”

“You should go,” Misato said with a wink. “And don’t hurry back for dinner. Rei and I can manage. You guys go and figure it out.”

"是的，但感觉到东西并不会让你变得软弱或什么的。这只是一种不同的力量。"美里说。"也许现在看起来不像，但总有一天，人们会因此爱上你。"

美里的脖子后面被什么东西刺了一下。她意识到，明日香正在看着她们两个。

"对吧，明日香？"

"没错。"她咕哝道。"真嗣。我们出去走走吧。"

"你该走了。"美里眨了眨眼睛说。"别急着回来吃晚饭。丽和我能应付。你们自己好好聊聊吧。"

They both looked grim as they marched out the door, but this was lost on Misato. I’m such a good mentor to them, she congratulated herself silently. She’d earned another beer.

他们走出门时都面无表情，但美里对此却不以为然。我真是他们的好导师，她默默地祝贺自己。她又开了一瓶啤酒。

~

The winter sun was setting and casting long shadows as they walked, without any particular goal in mind, as if they farther they walked, the more distant their problems would become.

“I hate this,” Asuka said, finally, her breath steaming before her. Shinji reached for her hands but she threw them off. “I should hate you for this too, but that’d just be you hating yourself. It’s all so pointless.”

冬日的夕阳投下长长的影子，他们走在路上，没有任何特别的目标，仿佛走得越远，问题就越遥远。

"我讨厌这样，"明日香终于开口说道，她的气息在她面前蒸腾。真嗣伸手去抓她的手，却被她甩开了。"我也应该为此恨你，但那只是你在恨你自己。这一切都毫无意义。"

“It might not be.” In spite of everything, she was perfection in the harsh frozen light. Hair aflame, her hands pressed to her lips. Her face was pink and puffy from crying and the cold, but somehow, this just made her eyes all the more cutting when they found his. He smiled, weakly. “What are you grinning at, idiot?”

"也许不是" 尽管如此，在刺眼的冰冻光线下，她还是那么完美。秀发如火，双手紧贴嘴唇。她的脸因为哭泣和寒冷而变得粉红浮肿，但不知何故，当她的眼睛对上他的眼睛时，这一切都让她的眼神更加犀利。他虚弱地笑了笑。"你在笑什么，八嘎？"

“You’re just really pretty right now.”

“Dummkopf. I’m always pretty.”

“But especially.”

“You can’t be serious. I’m a mess.” She fingered the tassels of her coat. “You’re good at this, sometimes.”

“What?”

"你现在真的很漂亮 "

"傻瓜 我一直都很漂亮.”

"但现在特别漂亮"

"你不是认真的吧 。我现在一团糟。" 她用手指着大衣的流苏 "有时你很擅长这个"

"什么？"

“I don’t know what to call it. But… It’s not like you say the right things. I don’t know what the right thing to say right now would be. But maybe, the things you say are better than the right thing to say.”

“That doesn’t make any sense.”

“I know. It’s dumb. Do you ever feel like, sometimes, we did things in the wrong order?”

“Like we shouldn’t have been entrusted with EVAs? Why didn’t they find adults to pilot them? Why didn’t they let us grow up first?”

“Yeah. I guess we more or less know why.”

“But it still sucks.”

"我不知道该怎么说。但是......你说的又不是正确的话。我不知道现在该说什么才对 但也许，你说的那些话， 比该说的那些话更好"

"这说不通啊。"

"我知道这很蠢。 你有没有觉得有时候， 我们做事情的顺序不对？"

"比如我们不应该被委托去驾驶 EVA？为什么不找成年人来驾驶？为什么不让我们先长大？"

"是啊，我想我们差不多知道原因了"

"但还是很糟糕"

They found a park, stripped bare by the cold, and took up residence on an empty bench. Every bench, in fact, was empty.

“Aren’t you going to ask if I’m okay?” she began once more. “Or have you decided you don’t need to ask that if I’m just a projection of your mind?”

He looked at his hands.

“I think we’re real, Asuka. I really, really do.”

“That’s not good enough. I need proof.”

“What do you want me to say?”

他们找到一个被寒风吹得光秃秃的公园，在一张空长椅上坐了下来。事实上，每张长椅都是空的。

"你不问问我好不好吗？"她又开始问。"还是你觉得如果我只是你的思想投影，你就不需要问了？"

他看着自己的双手。

"我觉得我们是真实的，明日香。我真的真的这么认为。"

"这不够好。我需要证据。"

"你想让我说什么？"

“I want you to figure it out,” she scowled. “I want you to find some missing key that makes everything okay and proves that we’re real and that I’m in love with your stupid ass and it’s not some shadow play orchestrated by your sick mind.”

“That’s what you want?”

“That’s what I want.”

The wind sailed through the park and naked branches trembled under its caresses.

“What if I can’t give that to you?”

"我要你想出办法来，"她皱着眉头说。"我想让你找到一把缺失的钥匙，让一切都好起来，证明我们是真实的，证明我爱上了你这个蠢货，这不是你病态心理策划的皮影戏。"

"这就是你想要的？"

"这就是我想要的"

风吹过公园，裸露的树枝在风的抚摸下颤抖。

"如果我不能给你呢？"

“Then I’m going to go insane.” She slumped, bundling her hands into her coat. “Shinji, I’m serious. I can handle everything else. What you did to me. What the Angels and the EVAs and NERV and SEELE did to me. What my own mother did to me. But this is too much. I can’t bear this.” A sob-wracked breath and then another. “I don’t want this. I can’t stand not knowing. I don’t know how long I can take this, Shinji. I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’m not strong enough. I need to know.”

“What will you do,” he asked after a few minutes. “If you don’t learn?” He was surprised at how strong his voice sounded, as if it were someone else’s.

"那我就要疯了" 她耷拉着脑袋，把双手捆进大衣里。"真嗣，我是认真的。我能处理好其他的事情。你对我做的一切。使徒、EVA、NERV 和 SEELE 对我做的事。我母亲对我做的事 但这太过分了 ，我受不了了 。”明日香一次又一次泣不成声的呼吸，"我不想这样， 我无法忍受一无所知。我不知道自己还能承受多久，真嗣。对不起， 对不起，我不够坚强。我需要知道真相。”

"你会怎么做？"几分钟后，他问。"如果这件事你没有学到过呢？" 他惊讶于自己的声音听起来如此有力，仿佛是别人的声音。

“I don’t know.”

“I followed you, to that store. That day.”

He saw her eyes widen.

“I got there just as you were climbing down from the chair. I hid and then I ran when I was sure you weren’t going to do it. I should have done something more.”

"我不知道 。"

"我那天跟踪你去了那家店。"

他看到她的眼睛睁大了。

"你从椅子上爬下来的时候，我就到了那里。我躲了起来， 然后我跑了 。当我确定你不会那么做的时候， 我知道我应该做得更多。

“If I had done it, what would you have done?”

“I would have tried to save you. Hold you up and try to pry the belt off your neck.”

“Liar. You couldn’t save me last time. Or you just didn’t.”

“It would have been different,” he whispered.

“I don’t believe you.”

“Will you try it again, if you don’t know the truth?”

“I don’t know.”

"如果我做了，你会怎么做？"

"我会试图救你， 扶着你，试着撬开你脖子上的皮带。"

"骗人。 你上次救不了我， 或者你根本就没救我。"

"那就不一样了。"他低声说。

"我不相信你。"

"如果你不知道真相，你还会再试一次吗？"

"我不知道。"

The wind left them and the park was very still. No birds. No buzz and hum of traffic. Just the slow breathing of the world, falling silent.

“Asuka, there is one way we can know for certain.” He watched her tighten. She seemed to shrink in her jacket. “If I die, you’ll know. This world will either disappear or—I’ll just die.”

风继续吹着，公园里一片寂静。没有鸟叫。没有车水马龙的嗡嗡声。只有世界缓慢的呼吸，陷入沉寂。

"明日香，有一个办法我们可以确定。" 他看着她紧缩的身体 她似乎缩进了外套里。 "如果我死了，你就会知道。"这个世界要么消失， 要么只是我死"

She didn’t speak for a long time.

“What are you suggesting?”

“I’ll do it. For you.”

“Idiot. That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”

“Then you’ll know.”

“No. I don’t want to know that badly.”

“But you do.”

她久久没有说话。

"你有什么建议？"

"我来做。为了你。”

"八嘎！这是我听过的最愚蠢的事。"

"那你就会知道"

"不，我没那么想知道"

"但你想知道"

“I’m not worth it.” She took a deep breath. “I’m not worth dying for.” But she leaned against his shoulder.

“We can do it tomorrow morning. We’ll sleep on it.”

“You’ll chicken out.”

“I won’t run away from this.”

“You’re an idiot.”

“You asked me to prove that I’m sorry? Will this be proof?”

“Idiot. I don’t need this kind of proof.”

“You’re so miserable because of things I did and didn’t do. Let me do this for you.”

“Shinji, please,” she whispered.

“Please what?”

“If—if we were real—and I had to be here without you—and face Misato and Rei—“

“Other people will wake up. You won’t need me.”

"我不值得" 她深吸一口气 "我不值得你为我而死" 她靠在他的肩膀上

"我们可以明早再做， 我们睡一觉再说。"

"你会退缩的。"

"我不会逃避。"

"你是个白痴。"

"你要我证明我很抱歉？这能证明吗？"

"白痴！我不需要这种证明。"

"我做过和没做过的事让你如此痛苦， 让我来帮你吧。"

"真嗣，求你了。"她低声说。

"求你什么？"

"如果我们是真实的 而我必须独自面对美里和丽"

"其他人会醒来， 你不需要我。"

“No. No. No. I need you. I do need you. I need you so badly.” She swallowed hard. “I’d follow you. After you do it. Either way. If you just die and I’m still here—I’ll end it too. We don’t have to be apart. You idiot. I can’t believe I’m promising to die with you.”

“Like Romeo and Juliet.”

“Kind of,” she said, her voice soft and tiny. “But that was more of a stupid misunderstanding. This is the fundamental tragedy of the human condition we’re dealing with.” She stretched out her hand to catch the setting sun on her fingertips. “I’m insufferable, aren’t I? Do you think I would have learned when I got older?”

“I hope not. I like you how you are.”

“I guess we’ll never know.”

"不，不，不，我需要你。我真的需要你， 我非常需要你。" 她艰难地咽了口唾沫。"我会跟着你。在你做完之后。无论如何， 如果你死了，而我还在这里，我也会结束我的生命。我们不分开。你个白痴。 真不敢相信我答应和你一起死。"

"就像罗密欧与朱丽叶"

"有点像，"她说，声音轻柔细小。"但那更像是一个愚蠢的误会。我们要面对的是人类最根本的悲剧。" 她伸出手，用指尖捕捉夕阳的余晖。"我真让人受不了，不是吗？你觉得我长大后会明白吗？"

"希望不会。我喜欢你现在的样子。"

"我想我们永远不会知道"

~

As they had agreed, they slept on it. They awoke, early, the next morning, and the sorrow and ache was still with them, so they rose. The others were still asleep.

Shinji wrote out a note explaining what they had done. He was best suited to this, both for his clear, neat handwriting and his skill at apologizing. Asuka ducked into Misato’s room, and filched the NERV-issued pistol from their passed-out guardian.

Together, they walked down to the beach, next to the sea of LCL. It made sense, they agreed, to end this chapter where it had begun.

按照约定，他们就此睡去。第二天清晨，他们醒了过来，悲伤和痛苦依然伴随着他们，于是他们站了起来。其他人还在睡梦中。

真嗣写了一张纸条，解释了他们所做的一切。他的字迹清晰工整，而且善于道歉，最适合做这件事。明日香躲进了美里的房间，从昏睡的监护人手中夺过了 NERV 发给她的手枪。

他们一起走到海边的 LCL 海边。他们一致认为，在开始的地方结束这一切是有意义的。

“So,” Shinji said after they’d stood on the shore a few minutes.

“Mm.” She would miss his warmth.

“Maybe we’ll just flow back into the LCL.”

“Maybe. Or maybe you’ll wake up and forget this ever happened.”

“I don’t want to forget this, if it’s a dream.”

“I would.”

"那么，"他们在岸边站了几分钟后，真嗣说。

"嗯" 她会想念他的温暖。

"也许我们可以回到LCL里"

"也许吧。也许你醒来后会忘记这一切"

"如果是梦，我不想忘记"

"我会的"

“I don’t believe that.”

She drew the pistol from her coat and handed it to him.

“You don’t have to do this.”

“I want to do this. For you.”

“I hate the way you say that.”

“Why? I’m sorry.”

“No. Don’t apologize. Because it sounds like you actually love me and that scares me.”

“Why?”

“Because that means you could stop loving me.”

"我不相信"

她从外套里抽出手枪递给他

"你不必这么做。"

"我想这么做 为了你。"

"我讨厌你这么说。"

"为什么？ 我很抱歉。"

"不 。不用道歉 。因为听起来你真的很爱我 ，这让我很害怕。"

"为什么？"

"因为这意味着你可能不再爱我。"

He examined the pistol. He aimed it out to the sea and then up in the air and then pressed it to his temple.

“Like this?”

She nodded. Words wouldn’t form on her lips. He lowered the gun.

“In olden times, you’d write a poem before you killed yourself.”

“Are you going to write a poem?”

He shook his head. “I’ve never been good at stuff like that.”

他检查了手枪。他把枪对准海面，然后举到空中，然后按在太阳穴上。

"像这样吗？"

她点了点头。她的嘴唇说不出话来。他放下了枪。

"古时候，你会在自杀前写一首诗。"

"你要写诗吗？"

他摇了摇头。"我从来不擅长写诗。"

He started to raise the gun once more. He pressed it to his skull.

“Asuka, I’m sorry.”

“Shinji, wait—“ she sputtered and reached for him as he squeezed his eyes shut and pulled the trigger.

“Ikari!”

The gun had clicked uselessly. He clicked it again and nothing happened. Rei was dashing towards them, tumbling down a snowy dune, her face flushed.

他开始再次举枪。他把枪对准了自己的头颅。

"明日香，对不起。”

"真嗣，等等...... "她哽咽着伸手去拉他，而他却紧闭双眼，扣动了扳机。

"碇君！"

枪发出了无用的咔嗒声。他再次扣动扳机，却没有任何反应。丽正冲向他们，从雪丘上翻滚下来，满脸通红。

“Ikari, stop it! Stop it!” she screamed.

“Ayanami?”

“Rei?”

Shinji lowered the pistol and stared at the panting girl.

“I found the note.”

“How did you know we’d be here?”

“I guessed,” she panted. “And I ran.”

"碇君，住手！住手！"她尖叫道。

"绫波？"

"丽？"

真嗣放下手枪，盯着气喘吁吁的女孩。

"我找到纸条了"

"你怎么知道我们会在这里？"

"我猜的" 她气喘吁吁地说 "然后我就跑了"

She plopped down onto the sand, head between her legs. For a second, it seemed she might throw up.

“Please, do not do this.”

“Well,” he said. “I think the gun is broken anyway.”

“What? Seriously?” Asuka groaned. “After all that—“

她瘫坐在沙地上，头埋在两腿之间。一瞬间，她似乎要吐了。

"求求你，别这样。"

"好吧，"他说 "反正枪也坏了。"

"什么？真的吗？" 明日香呻吟道。"毕竟......"

Rei held out her hand and Shinji passed the pistol to her. She clicked the safety off, aimed it at one of the dunes, and squeezed off a pair of shots. The other two jumped with each report.

“It works fine. The safety was on.”

“Oh.”

“Idiot,” Asuka whispered. “Didn’t turn off the safety.”

“How was I supposed to know about that? I’ve never fired a gun.”

丽伸出手，真嗣把手枪递给她。她打开保险，瞄准其中一个沙丘，"砰砰 "开了两枪。每一声枪响，另外两个沙丘都会跳起来。

"很好用。保险开着。"

"哦"

"白痴。"明日香低声说。"没有关掉保险"

"我怎么会知道？我从没开过枪。"

“Oh, that’s right,” Asuka said. She slapped her forehead. “All the NERV quarterly trainings were in that month when you were stuck inside Unit 1.”

“Ah, that is correct,” Rei nodded. She stood up. “We had mandatory small arms training.”

“Really? NERV did stuff like that?”

"哦，对了，"明日香说。她拍了拍额头。"所有的 NERV 季度训练都是在你被困在 初号机的那个月进行的。"

"啊，没错。"丽点了点头。她站了起来。"我们进行了强制性的小型武器训练。"

"真的吗？NERV 也有这样的训练？"

“And a variety of human resources workshops on giving and accepting feedback, creating a positive work environment, investing your retirement savings—“ Rei continued.

“There was even a weekend-long retreat with all the operations staff,” Asuka nodded. “We talked about what frustrated us about NERV. Fuyutsuki cried.” She let out a long, slow sigh. “It was super weird.”

"还有关于给予和接受反馈、创造积极的工作环境、退休储蓄投资的各种人力资源研讨会--"。丽接着说。

“甚至有一个为期周末的、带有所有行动人员的静修， "明日香点了点头。"我们讨论了让我们对 NERV 感到沮丧的地方。冬月哭了"。她长长地叹了口气。"真是超级奇怪。"

“Ikari, please do not do this.”

“Ayanami, I think I have to.”

“No, you don’t.” She turned to Asuka.

“Don’t look at me! It wasn’t my idea.”

“What will you do, if he dies and you remain?”

Asuka turned away from both of them. “I’ll do it too.”

“And you’ll leave me alone.”

The waves of LCL crashed soft against the shore.

“I’ll die as well,” Rei sighed, finally. “I have died before.”

"碇君，请不要这么做。"

"绫波，我想我必须这么做。"

"不，你不能这么做" 她转向明日香。

"别看我，这不是我的主意。"

"如果他死了，你还活着，你会怎么做？"

明日香转过身去 "我也会这么做"

"然后你们就会丢下我一个人。"

海浪轻轻拍打着 LCL海岸。

"我也会去死" 丽终于叹了口气 "我曾经死过"

“Show off,” Asuka muttered. The three of them stared out at the sea: Lillith’s massive body remained, and Rei seemed fantastically small, reflected in the giant.

“It’s not so different from the philosophical dilemma humans have always lived with,” Rei said after a few minutes. “Living always requires some kind of faith. We’ll never have complete certainty that we aren’t someone else’s dream, or that we ourselves aren’t dreaming, or that we have free will. But we can’t help but live as if we are real, and as if we do have free will.”

"炫耀吧，"明日香嘀咕道。他们三人凝视着大海： 莉莉丝庞大的身躯依然存在，丽在巨人的映衬下显得异常渺小。

几分钟后，丽说："这与人类一直以来的哲学困境并无太大区别。"生活总是需要某种信仰。我们永远无法完全确定我们不是别人的梦，或者我们自己不是在做梦，或者我们有自由意志。但我们不能不活着，就好像我们是真实的，就好像我们有自由意志。"

“But you said you thought this was the most likely scenario,” Shinji said.

“Yes. I do. But there are other scenarios that are also possible and since it’s unknowable—“

“But it is knowable,” Asuka growled.

“But at a terrible cost. Do you truly wish for Ikari to die?”

"但你说你认为这是最有可能发生的情况，"真嗣说。

"是的。但也有其他可能的情况，因为它是不可知的--"

"但它是可知的，"明日香咆哮道。

"但代价是惨痛的。你真的希望碇君死吗？"

“No! No! Of course not!” Asuka screamed. Her face seemed to shatter before them and she drew her hand back, swiping it hard across Rei’s face. She stumbled back a few steps under the force of the blow and touched her enflamed cheek. “That’s the last thing I want. I just feel like I’m losing my mind.”

“Asuka,” Shinji said, softly. “It’s okay. Let’s just do it. Let me do this for you.”

“Why do you love me like this?” she whispered. “Do you love me? Or is this some pitiful scene you’re orchestrating to make yourself feel better?”

He smiled, sadly, and pressed the barrel to his head once more.

“I wish I could tell you.”

"不，不，当然不！" 明日香尖叫道。她的脸似乎在他们面前破碎了，她抽回手，狠狠地扫在丽的脸上。她被这一击的力量打得踉跄后退了几步，摸了摸自己发红的脸颊。"这是我最不想要的。我只觉得自己快疯了。"

"明日香，"真嗣轻声说。"没事的。让我们做吧。让我为你做这件事。"

"你为什么要这样爱我？"她低声说。"你爱我吗？还是说这是你为了让自己好受一点 而精心策划的可怜场景？"

他凄然一笑，再次把枪管按在头上。

"我希望我能告诉你。"

He closed his eyes and the gun went off. He opened them once more, surprised to be able to do such a thing. Asuka had reached for the gun, pulled it a few inches forward just in time, and the shot had flown harmlessly between their faces, leaving a perfume of gun powder hanging over their lips.

“I don’t want this,” she said. “Not like this. Not ever. If I’m going to die, I don’t want the last thing I see to be you—doing this.”

“Ikari,” Rei said. Her voice was soft but firm. “Why don’t you give me the gun?”

He handed it over and Rei tucked it away into her jacket. She watched, silently, as Asuka wrapped herself around Shinji’s neck. She couldn’t hear what they were saying to one another, but she suspected she already knew.

他闭上眼睛，枪响了。他再次睁开眼睛，惊讶地发现自己竟然能做出这样的事情。明日香伸手去拿枪，及时把枪向前拉了几英寸，子弹无害地从他们的脸之间飞过，留下一缕火药的香味在他们的嘴唇上弥漫。

"我不想这样，"她说。"不想这样。永远都不要。如果我要死了，我不想最后看到的是你这样做。"

"碇君，"丽说。她的声音温柔而坚定。"为什么不把枪给我？"

他把枪递了过来，丽把它塞进了夹克里。她静静地看着明日香搂住真嗣的脖子。她听不到他们在说什么，但她怀疑自己已经知道了。

“You guys went out early!” Misato chirped when they arrived back at the apartment. Their faces were flushed and haggard from the cold. “What were you up to?”

“We just went on a walk,” Shinji said. Misato noted with approval that he and Asuka were holding hands.

“We all had some stuff to work through,” Asuka said. “Everyone needed a good cry.”

"你们提前出去了！" 当他们回到公寓时，美里叽叽喳喳地说。他们的脸色因寒冷而潮红、憔悴。"你们去干什么了？"

"我们只是去散散步。"真嗣说。美里赞许地注意到他和明日香手牵着手。

"我们都有一些事情要解决，"明日香说。"每个人都需要好好哭一场。"

“I just love how you guys support each other now.” Misato leaned her head on her hand, blinking away last night’s beer. “You’re such good kids. I wish I had friends like you when I was your age.”

They stared in grim wonder at her until Rei spoke up.

“Major Katsuragi, I would like to read a magazine. May I take one from your bedroom?”

"我真喜欢你们现在互相支持的样子" 美里把头靠在手上，眨了眨眼睛，把昨晚的啤酒一饮而尽。"你们真是好孩子。真希望我在你们这个年纪的时候也有你们这样的朋友。"

他们面无表情地看着她，直到丽开口说话。

"葛城少佐，我想看一本杂志。我可以从你的卧室拿一本吗？"

“Oh. Uh, sure—I don’t see why not.”

“Thank you.”

Rei disappeared into Misato’s room and reemerged moments later, holding a glossy fashion magazine.

“I have been wanting to read this one,” she said, looking at everyone.

"哦，当然，我不觉得有什么不可以。"

"谢谢。"

丽消失在美里的房间里，过了一会儿又出现了，手里拿着一本光鲜亮丽的时尚杂志。

她看着大家说："我一直想看看这本杂志。"

That evening, Asuka stepped into the apartment, leaving Shinji and Rei on the balcony. The sun had gone down and the balcony lights barely caught the steam rising off their tea, reflecting off their pale faces.

As soon as the door clicked shut, she felt something was wrong. Misato sat at the dining room table. A note was in her hand. The note they had left that morning. Her pistol lay next to a glistening can of beer.

The spilled beer can on the floor explained everything. Misato looked up.

那天傍晚，明日香走进公寓，把真嗣和丽留在阳台上。太阳已经下山，阳台上的灯光勉强照到了他们喝茶时升起的蒸汽，反射在他们苍白的脸上。

门一关上，她就觉得有些不对劲。美里坐在餐桌旁。她手里拿着一张纸条。那是他们那天早上留下的字条。她的手枪旁边放着一罐闪闪发光的啤酒。

地上洒落的啤酒罐说明了一切。美里抬起头。

“Asuka.” How was it possible for a voice to sound so drained of blood? So pale? “Asuka, what is this.”

“Where did you find that?”

“The floor. I spilled my beer and it was just under the table. Asuka—“

"明日香" 美里的声音怎么可能听起来如此没有血色？如此苍白？"明日香， 这是什么？

"你在哪里找到的？"

"地板上 。我打翻了啤酒，它就在桌子下面。明日香"

Damn it, Rei. She must have found the note and dropped it as she dashed out of the door. She’d remembered to return the gun to Misato’s room, but they’d all forgotten about the note.

They regarded each other in silence for several moments. Say it, Asuka dared her with a fierce look. Say something. Say anything. Finally, Asuka took the initiative. As if it were nothing unusual, she strode forward and plucked the note out of Misato’s hand. She held it over one of the stove burners and it was gone in seconds, a mass of smoking cinders that she carefully swept into the trash.

该死的，丽。她一定是发现了那张纸条 ，然后在冲出门的时候把它掉在了地上 。她记得把枪放回美里的房间，但他们都忘了那张纸条。

两人默默地对视了一会儿。说吧，明日香用凶狠的眼神看着她。说点什么吧， 说什么都行。最后，明日香采取了主动。她大步走上前去，从美里手中夺过纸条。她把纸条放在一个炉子上，几秒钟后纸条就不见了，变成了一团冒烟的焦炭，她小心翼翼地把它扔进了垃圾桶。

“You read it,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Asuka, three cartridges from this magazine are missing.”

“That sounds about right.”

“What happened this morning?”

"你读过了，"她说。这不是一个问题。

"明日香，弹夹里的三颗子弹不见了。"

"是的。"

"今天早上发生了什么事？"

“You don’t need to know. It won’t happen again, and no one got hurt.” Misato frowned. She bowed her head. Her hand hovered over the pistol for a second before returning to her lap.

“Don’t lie to me, Asuka. Please. Not now. Not in my own house.”

“I’m not lying to you,” Asuka said. She rounded on Misato. “I won’t let anything like this happen again. I promise. I don’t want it.”

“Asuka, did Shinji—“

"你不需要知道 ，这种事不会再发生了，没有人受伤。" 美里皱起了眉头。她低下了头。她的手在手枪上徘徊了一秒钟，然后又回到了腿上。

"别对我撒谎，明日香。求你了。现在不行。不要在我自己的房子里。"

"我没有骗你。"明日香说。她围着美里转。"我不会再让这样的事情发生了。我保证， 我不想这样。"

"明日香，是不是真嗣做的......"

“Shut up. Please. Please. Please. I don’t want to think about it. I don’t want to think about today ever again. I want to forget all about this. I want to pretend this never happened. I want to pretend this world is real and I’m real and so are you and so is Wondergirl and we’re all one little happy family. Even if it’s not true, I’ll try to pretend. Even if I lose my mind, I won’t be the one to ruin it.”

“闭嘴 ！求你了！求你了！求你了！我不想再想了， 我不想再想今天的事了 ！我想忘掉这一切 ！我想假装这一切从未发生过 ！我想假装这个世界是真实的！我是真实的 ！你也是！优等生也是！ 我们都是快乐的小家庭！ 即使这不是真的，我也要假装！ 即使我失去了理智， 我也不会毁了它！"

“It might not be true,” Misato whispered.

“Exactly. That’s what Rei kept saying. So drop it. That’s what we need to believe.”

“Of course,” Misato said. She was smiling. It hurt to see her smile like that. “Just when I thought we could all be happy—there had to be something. I should have known.”

“That’s right. I went and decided I was finally happy, for once in my life, and this happened.”

"可能不是真的。"美里低声说。

"没错 ，丽也一直这么说。那就放弃吧。这才是我们需要相信的。"

"当然。"美里说。她在微笑 看到她这样的笑容，我很心疼。"就在我以为我们都能快乐的时候，一定有什么事发生了。我早该知道。"

"没错。我去了并决定我终于快乐了一次， 在我的生活中，这发生了。"

“Did you tell Shinji?”

“What?”

“That you’re happy?”

“Was happy.”

“Whatever.”

“Not—exactly. Not yet. Sort of. This morning. It doesn’t matter now. I’ll never be happy but that’s okay.”

“I’m sorry, Asuka. If it helps—not being happy and pretending you are. That’s a big part of being an adult.”

“Oh, go to hell.”

"你告诉真嗣了吗？"

"什么？"

"你很开心？"

"很开心。"

"随便啦。"

"不完全是。还没有 ，算是吧。 今天早上。 现在无所谓了。 我永远不会快乐，但没关系。"

"对不起，明日香。如果这对你有帮助的话，我不会假装快乐。这是做一个成年人的重要部分。"

"哦，去死吧。"

“I’m serious.” Asuka slunk into the chair across from Misato and buried her face in her arms. “You always talked so much about being an adult. You know what being an adult is? Staying awake till the wee hours of the morning, worrying about things you can’t control. Getting up in the morning and putting on a brave face for those around you. Doing things you hate for people you love who’ll never, ever appreciate you.” As she spoke, she began to wiggle a pop-tab from a beer. Finally, it snapped free. Misato held it up to the light for a second, appraising it, and then tossed it over her shoulder into the trash. “Drinking to forget people who don’t deserve you.”

"我是认真的" 明日香瘫坐在美里对面的椅子上，把脸埋在她的臂弯里。"你总是说要做个大人。你知道什么是成年人吗？直到凌晨都不睡觉，担心你无法控制的事情。早上起床，为身边的人装出一副勇敢的样子。为你爱的人做你讨厌的事，而你爱的人却永远不会感激你。" 说话的同时，她开始晃动啤酒罐上的拉环。最后，它终于被拉掉了。美里把它举起来对着灯光看了一会儿，然后把它从肩上扔进了垃圾桶。"喝酒是为了忘记那些不值得你这样做的人"

When Asuka didn’t say anything more, Misato scowled and retreated to the fridge. She plopped a beer down in front of the girl and cracked one open for herself.

“Drink up, kid. It only gets worse from here.”

They raised their cans together.

明日香没有再说什么，美里皱了皱眉头，退到冰箱旁。她把一瓶啤酒放在女孩面前，自己也打开了一瓶。

"喝吧，孩子。情况只会越来越糟。"

两人一起举起啤酒罐。

“Here, in Germany, they do this,” Asuka said, reaching over and sliding Misato’s arm over hers, so that they were linked. “They call it Brüderschaft trinken.” They both took deep sips. Misato tried to say the foreign word, stumbling over the strange sounds. Asuka had only ever her speak English in Germany, or Japanese with her and Kaji.

“There. Now, if we were speaking German, we’d be close enough to call each other ‘du’ when talking.”

"在德国，他们是这样做的，"明日香说着，伸手将美里的胳膊滑到她的胳膊上，这样她们就连在一起了。"他们叫它'喝兄弟情'" 两人都深深地抿了一口。美里试着说这个外来词，但说得磕磕绊绊。明日香只在德国说过英语，在她和加持面前说日语。

"好了。现在，如果我们说的是德语，我们就会很亲近，可以在交谈时互相叫对方'du'了。"

“That’s cute. Japanese doesn’t work like that, of course.”

“It’s so complicated.”

They slurped from their beers into the silence.

"真可爱。 当然，日语不是这样的。"

"日语太复杂了。"

他们在沉默中啜饮着啤酒。

### Chapter 3: Spring

If Instrumentality had liquefied the human race instantaneously, the thaw that arrived a few weeks after that day on the beach slushed the snow still clinging to the soil at a much more languid pace. The change was so gradual that day to day, no difference could be perceived: Asuka still pulled her scarf tight over her face, scowling at the bitter winds and scowling at Rei, who had never known winter or even seen winter clothes, it seemed, and so practically needed to be dressed before going out (that day on the beach, in fact, she had dashed out after them wearing pajamas, which she normally had to be reminded not to wear outside); Misato still preferred to stay inside, watching the snow from their window with a stack of NERV documents and a beer as her faithful companions; and Shinji still did practically every chore he could identify, in a silent routine of daily penance that none of his roommates questioned.

如果说 "补完 "曾使人类瞬间液化，那么那天在海滩上几周后的解冻则以更缓慢的速度冲刷着仍附着在土壤上的积雪。这种变化是如此的渐进，以至于从早到晚都感觉不到任何不同： 明日香仍然紧紧地把围巾蒙在脸上，对着凛冽的寒风皱眉头，对着丽皱眉头，丽似乎从来没有经历过冬天，甚至没有见过冬天的衣服，所以出门之前几乎都要穿戴整齐（事实上，那天在海滩上，她穿着睡衣就跟在他们后面冲了出去，而她通常都要别人提醒她不要在外面穿睡衣）； 美里仍然喜欢呆在屋子里，从窗户看雪，一叠 NERV 的文件和一杯啤酒是她忠实的伙伴；真嗣仍然默默地做着他能做的所有家务，每天都在忏悔，没有一个室友对此提出质疑。

Still, the thaw arrived, and surprised with its arrival. Shinji noticed it one day when, after an aimless, mostly silent walk—just the two of them—Asuka pushed him to the ground. He fell on soft, moist soil which nursed baby grass—not the frozen earth he expected.

“Ow!” he cried. “What did you do that for?”

“I don’t know.” She was grinning at him, flushed. The tears, balanced on her eyelashes, a product of the wind, made her look like some mischievous demon child. “I just felt like it, you know?”

“You should apologize when you do something like that,” he grunted. She reached out her hands and he took them. She pulled him to his feet and then pushed him again, harder. He tumbled even further off the path and once again, hit soft Earth.

然而，解冻还是来了，而且来得让人吃惊。真嗣注意到了这一点，有一天，在一次漫无目的、大部分时间都沉默不语的散步之后--只有他们两个人--明日香把他推到了地上。他摔倒在松软湿润的土壤上，那里长满了小草，而不是他想象中的冰天雪地。

"嗷！"他叫道。"你为什么这么做？"

"我不知道" 她冲他咧嘴一笑，满脸通红。睫毛上的泪珠是风的产物，让她看起来像个调皮的恶魔小孩。"我只是觉得喜欢，你知道吗？"

"你做这种事的时候应该道歉。"他咕哝道。她伸出双手，他握住了。她把他拉起来，然后再次用力推他。他在小路上翻滚得更远了，再一次撞上了松软的土地。

“Ow!”

“Sorry.”

She settled herself on top of him like a hen nesting.

“We’re gonna’ get all muddy, Asuka.”

“Then you can wash our clothes. Or we’ll steal new ones.”

"嗷！"

"对不起。"

她像母鸡筑巢一样把自己压在他身上。

"我们会弄得一身泥的，明日香。"

"那你可以洗我们的衣服。 不然我们就去偷新的。"

They lay there, in the mud, saying nothing and wanting nothing, set in silence that wasn’t silence, because there was life all around them: they heard birds, chattering from their perches on the budding branches about them. They heard the wet kisses of moist things growing, slowly but inexorably. They heard the wind and they heard their own breathing.

“You picked such a dirty place to tackle me,” Shinji said, at one point.

“Shut up, idiot.”

他们躺在泥地里，什么也不说，什么也不想要，沉浸在并不寂静的寂静中，因为周围充满了生机：他们听到鸟儿在他们身边含苞待放的树枝上叽叽喳喳地叫着。他们听到湿润的东西湿润的亲吻，缓慢但不可阻挡地生长着。他们听到了风声，听到了自己的呼吸声。

"你挑了个这么脏的地方来对付我，"真嗣在这一刻说。

"闭嘴，八嘎。"

They felt, both of them, the truth that somehow, however impossible it was to imagine, they were part of this ecology: a world larger than humans, which breathed and lived without humans, whose struggles and sorrows were nothing to it. And even if it were a dream, that only meant that this respiring body existed elsewhere, continuing to wake anew each spring.（-经典要来了）

他们俩都感受到了这样一个事实：无论如何无法想象，他们都是这一生态的一部分：一个比人类更大的世界，它在没有人类的情况下呼吸和生活，它的挣扎和悲伤对它来说都不算什么。即使这是一场梦，那也只是意味着这个呼吸的躯体存在于别处，在每个春天继续苏醒。

“Hey, Shinji.”

“Yeah?”

“Can I ask you to promise me something?”

“Of course.”

“It’s dumb.”

“That’s okay.”

“You’ll think it’s stupid.”

“I won’t.”

“If this is a dream, and you wake up some day—“

"嘿，真嗣"

"什么事？"

"我能请你答应我一件事吗？"

"当然可以。"

"这很蠢。"

"没关系。"

"你会觉得很蠢。"

"我不会。"

"如果这是一场梦，有一天你醒来—"

A crow took off with a sudden screech. It alighted upon a new perch and seemed to watch them.

“Promise you’ll come find me? In the real world. If you promise me that, and then we can be just like this for real—even for one day—I think I’ll be able to hold on.”

“I promise.”

一只乌鸦突然尖叫着飞走了。它落在一个新的栖息地上，似乎在注视着他们。

"你能答应来找我吗？在现实世界里。如果你答应我，然后我们就能像这样真实地在一起，哪怕只有一天，我想我就能坚持下去。"

"我保证。"

“Wait, Third Child! Don’t agree to things without knowing all the details. After all, I might be dead. I might be LCL. You’ll have to find me. You’ll have to—I don’t know—titrate me out of all the other souls all squished up together.”

“I promise.”

“I might be in Hell. You might have to get into Unit 1 and fight all of Satan’s demonic legions to rescue me.”

“I promise.”

“God Himself might be angered by your insolence, daring to challenge the order of the universe. You might have to become the new Satan, and wage a thousand-year war against God and all His angels, just to have one day with me in a cold muddy field. Not even a day. One afternoon.”

"等等，真嗣！不要在不知道所有细节的情况下就答应别人。毕竟，我可能已经死了。我可能是 LCL， 你必须找到我。你得--我也不知道--把我从所有其他挤在一起的灵魂中筛选出来。"

"我保证。"

"我可能在地狱。 你可能得进入初号机与撒旦的恶魔军团作战来救我。"

"我保证。"

"神可能会被你的傲慢激怒， 敢于挑战宇宙的秩序 ，你可能会成为新的撒旦，与神和他的所有使徒展开一场长达千年的战争，只为了和我在冰冷泥泞的土地上共度一天。即使一天也没有。只有一个下午。"

“I’d do it. I’ve got a pretty good track record against Angels, anyway.”

“You promise?”

“Promise.”

“Idiot,” she said through a grin. “No one should promise to do something so stupid.”

“I guess I’m stupid enough.”

"我会的， 反正我对付使徒的战绩也不错。"

"你保证？"

"我保证。"

"八嘎，"她笑着说 "没人应该答应做这么蠢的事。"

"我想我已经够蠢了。"

“You are. That’s why I like you. You’re the only one who’s stupid enough to want to be with me.” She flicked his nose. “I’m going to hold you to it. But if this is just part of you talking, you might have to convince me, you know. When you find me. What will you say to me, when you find me? Remember, I won’t know anything about this promise you made with the imaginary Me.”

"你是的。所以我才喜欢你 你是唯一一个傻到愿意和我在一起的人。" 她弹了弹他的鼻子 "我会让你坚持下去的。但如果这只是你说话的一部分，你可能得说服我，你知道的。当你找到我时， 当你找到我时，你会对我说什么？"记住，我不会知道你和假想的我的约定"

“I don’t know.”

“What will you say?”

“Knowing me, something dumb. I’ll probably ask if you want to kiss.”

“Mein Gott, but that is lame. You need a sexy line, like something Kaji would have said.”

"我不知道。"

"你会说什么？"

"以我的个性，一定会说蠢话。 我可能会问你想不想接吻。"

"我的天啊，这太蹩脚了。你需要一句性感的台词，就像加持会说的那样。"

“Well, if I have to fight a thousand-year war against Heaven and Hell while also figuring out how to suck your LCL out of the primordial soup of all humanity—I think I’ll have enough time to come up with something good.”

“You’d better.” She swallowed hard. “This is really tough.”

“I know.”

“They don’t teach this in school.”

“No.”

“You don’t even know what I’m talking about.”

“Everything.”

"好吧，如果我既要与天堂和地狱进行一场长达千年的战争 又要想办法从全人类的原始汤汁中 吸出你的 LCL，我想我有足够的时间想出好办法。"

"最好是这样。" 她艰难地咽了口唾沫。"这真的很难。"

"我知道。"

"学校不教这个。"

"没有教过。"

"你甚至不知道我在说什么。"

"我什么都知道。"

“Yeah.” She tucked her fingers into his hair. “Sometimes, I feel like I’m going to overflow. Sometimes, I want to scream and break everything in sight. Sometimes, I just want to pin you to a wall and touch you. Sometimes, I can’t stand the sight of you. Sometimes, I can’t stand the idea of Rei or Misato even looking at you.”

He didn’t say anything, and even though that disappointed her at first, she realized he was holding her tighter.

The sky changed overhead.

“This world really is beautiful,” he said, finally.（-Japanese talking style）

"是的" 她把手指塞进他的头发里。"有时候，我觉得自己快要溢出来了。有时候，我想尖叫，想打碎眼前的一切。有时，我只想把你按在墙上，抚摸你。有时，我无法忍受看到你。有时，我甚至无法忍受丽或美里看你一眼。"

他没有说话，尽管一开始这让她很失望，但她意识到他把她抱得更紧了。

头顶的天空变了。

"这个世界真的很美，"他最后说。

Spring had come, and like lovers all throughout human history, recorded and otherwise, they had found things stronger than sorrow.

春天来了，就像人类历史上所有有记载的恋人一样，他们找到了比悲伤更强烈的东西。

~

The ides of March found Asuka and Rei at yet another convenience store, digging through the remnants early twenty-first century human cuisine. This store was still further from the apartment, and they would abandon it in a week or so, moving on to the better stuff that still hid from them, undiscovered groceries will full freezers. The grid held out, and so did they.

三月伊始，明日香和丽又来到了一家便利店，翻找着二十一世纪初人类的残余美食。这家店离公寓更远，一周左右他们就会放弃，转而去找那些还藏在他们身边的更好的东西，未被发现的杂货和满满的冰柜。电网在坚持，他们也在坚持。

“I have never tried these,” Rei murmured. She gazed at a package of rice snacks.

“Are they expired?”

“No.”

“Then let’s take them.”

"我从来没吃过这些。"丽喃喃地说。她凝视着一包大米点心。

"过期了吗？"

"没有"

"那就吃吧。"

“Yes.” Rei hugged the package tight to her chest. A sudden chime and foot steps told them that someone else had just entered the convenience store.

Shinji? Asuka mouthed to Rei. Rei shook her head. No—the steps had a clacky edge to them. Whoever it was, they were wearing high heels.

Misato? Asuka mouthed again. Rei shrugged, listened, and then shook her head. No—these footsteps weren’t going to the fridge for beer or ready-made noodles. And if it were Misato, why hadn’t she called out to them?

"是的" 丽把包裹紧紧抱在胸前。一阵突如其来的铃声和脚步声告诉他们，有人刚走进便利店。

真嗣？明日香小声问丽。丽摇了摇头。不，脚步声有一种咔嗒咔嗒的感觉。不管是谁，他们都穿着高跟鞋。

美里？明日香又说了一遍。丽耸耸肩，听了听，然后摇了摇头。不，这些脚步声不是去冰箱拿啤酒或现成的面条。如果是美里，她为什么不喊他们呢？

Asuka cracked her knuckles. She looked fiercely at Rei, flaring her nostrils and softly punching her fist into her palm. She nodded at the front of the store but Rei shook her head. Asuka nodded. Rei shook her head. Asuka nodded. She hadn’t taken NERV’s subsidized Krav Maga classes for nothing, after all. And that was in addition to her black belt in taekwondo from when she lived in Germany. She set down the ten-kilo bag of rice she’d been holding, and strode towards the counter, peeling and unpeeling her feet against the tile floor to keep from making too much noise. Rei followed several steps behind, still holding the rice snacks.

明日香咬破了指关节。她恶狠狠地看着丽，鼻孔微张，轻轻地把拳头打在掌心。她冲着店门口点了点头，但丽却摇了摇头。明日香点了点头。丽摇摇头。明日香点了点头。毕竟，她没有白白参加 NERV 资助的 Krav Maga 课程。这是她在德国生活时获得的跆拳道黑带。她放下手里那袋十公斤重的大米，大步走向柜台，双脚在瓷砖地板上剥了又剥，以免发出太大的声响。丽在后面紧跟几步，手里还拿着大米点心。

Whoever it was, they were behind the counter. Asuka took a deep breath, approached the counter, and then flung herself over it, leg out. She let out a righteous yawp and the ball of her foot caught the figure just as it stood up, cutting under its shoulder blade and slamming it hard into the wall.

Had she not realized who it was at the last second, she would have floated, with the utmost elegance, back over the counter, using the force of her attack to guide her body back to safety. The splash of blonde hair which revealed itself at the last second, however, confounded her recovery and Asuka yelped as she crashed into the counter.

不管是谁，他们都在柜台后面。明日香深吸一口气，走近柜台，然后猛地扑过去，伸出腿。她义无反顾地打了个呵欠，脚球在那个人影站起来的一瞬间抓住了他，从他的肩胛骨下切过，把他狠狠地撞到了墙上。

要不是她在最后一秒才意识到那是谁，她一定会以最优雅的姿态飘回柜台上方，利用攻击的力量将自己的身体引回安全地带。然而，在最后一秒显露出来的一缕金发让她的恢复能力大打折扣，明日香在撞上柜台时发出了一声惨叫。

“Dr. Akagi,” Rei murmured. “Welcome back.”

“What—what the hell?” Ritsuko held herself braced against a wall, pulling herself to her feet. “Asuka? Asuka?”

“Sorry! We thought you might be—uh—“

“What? Who did you think I could be, such that you needed to attack me with a flying kick?” Ritusko groaned.

"赤木博士，"丽喃喃道。"欢迎回来。"

"搞什么鬼？" 律子把自己撑在墙上，站了起来。"明日香？明日香？"

"对不起！ 我们以为你—嗯—"

"什么？你们以为我会是谁，以至于需要用飞踢来攻击我？" 律子呻吟着。

“Yes, Asuka,” Rei agreed. “Who did we think she could be such that we needed to attack her?”

“I—just—wanted to establish dominance. If it were a new person.”

“Well, it’s not,” Ritsuko grunted. “Or, it is. I don’t know.” They both climbed over the counter. Ritsuko placed the cigarettes she’d been scavenging next to the other items she’d collected: aspirin and bandages. She dusted herself off and unbuttoned her blouse to examine a bandage clinging to her belly. “At least this didn’t come undone.”

"是的，明日香，"丽同意道。"我们以为她会是谁，以至于我们需要攻击她？"

"我只是想确立主导地位。如果是个新人的话。"

"嗯，可惜不是。"律子哼了一声。"或者，就是。我不知道。" 两人都爬上了柜台。律子把捡来的香烟放在她收集的其他物品旁边：阿司匹林和绷带。她掸了掸身上的灰尘，解开上衣的扣子，检查贴在腹部的绷带。"至少这个没有解开"

The two girls regarded the blonde woman for several seconds as she adjusted her clothes. She’d apparently ditched her lab coat for a warmer overcoat—a Burberry coat, in fact. She must have passed through a department store on her way up from the beach, Asuka noted. In her memory palace, she mentally filed away a reminder to explain to Rei what a Burberry coat was, and a department store.

在金发女人调整衣服时，两个女孩看了她好几秒钟。她显然已经脱掉了白大褂，换上了一件更暖和的大衣--事实上是一件巴宝莉大衣。明日香注意到，她从海滩上来的路上一定经过了一家百货商店。在她的记忆宫殿里，她在心里提醒自己要向丽解释什么是巴宝莉大衣，什么是百货公司。

“So, you two are back,” Ritsuko said finally. “I was worried when I didn’t see anyone.”

“And Ikari. And Misato,” Rei offered.

“I figured as much.”

Asuka stepped forward. Ritsuko managed a smile.

“Asuka, are you—“

The girl’s open palm whipped across her face. Ritsuko lifted a hand to her swollen cheek.

"你们俩回来了。"律子终于开口了。"没看到人，我很担心。"

"还有碇君。还有美里。"丽说。

"我也猜到了。"

明日香走上前来。律子勉强笑了笑。

"你真是明日香......"

女孩张开的手掌拂过她的脸。律子抬手摸了摸她肿胀的脸颊。

“I won’t say I didn’t deserve that,” she said, feeling around inside her mouth with her tongue, finding blood. “But what was that for, specifically?”

“NERV. Generally.”

“Rei, if you want to get a shot in, be my guest.”

Rei shook her head. She retreated to the freezers, found a bag of frozen peas, and pressed it to Ritsuko’s face.

"我不会说我活该，"她说，用舌头在嘴里摸来摸去，发现了血迹。"但具体是为什么呢？"

"NERV。一般来说。"

"丽，如果你想打一针，请便。"

丽摇了摇头。她退到冰柜前，找到一袋冷冻豌豆，把它按在律子的脸上。

“That’s… very charitable of you, Rei. Considering everything that happened.”

“This world is different now,” Rei shrugged. “I have more important things to do than hate you.”

She gestured to the rice snacks.

“We should hurry home. Ikari will need to make extra for dinner tonight.”

"你真是......很有风度，丽。考虑到发生的一切"

"这个世界已经不同了。"丽耸耸肩。"我有比恨你更重要的事情要做。"

她指了指米饭点心。

"我们应该赶快回家。碇君今晚的晚餐需要多做一些。"

~ A party was declared in honor of Ritsuko’s return. Beers were poured and after dinner, the five of them retreated to the bar.

“This place?” Ritsuko asked, staring at the marquis. Somehow, none of them had ever commented on the name before and in the dim light of street lamps—several of the bulbs had gone out—Ritsuko read the Latin letters aloud. “Memento Vivere. Misato, didn’t you get kicked out of here once?”

“Everything that happened before Third Impact doesn’t count,” Misato said, and grabbed her arm. They sat together at the bar while the teenagers piled into a booth, Shinji between the girls.

为了庆祝律子的归来，大家举行了一场聚会。大家斟满啤酒，晚餐后，五个人来到吧台。

"这个地方？" 律子盯着marquis问道。不知为什么，他们之前都没有对这个名字发表过意见，在昏暗的路灯下--有几个灯泡已经熄灭了--律子大声读着拉丁字母。"Memento Vivere。美里，你不是曾经被赶出这里吗？"

"第三次冲击之前发生的一切都不算数。"美里说着，抓住了她的胳膊。他们一起坐在吧台前，青少年们则挤在一个包厢里，真嗣夹在女孩们中间。

“How often do you go drinking with them?” Ritsuko asked, frowning.

“Um, only a few nights a week.”

“That’s not healthy. For anyone.”

“C’mon… It’s the end of the world,” Misato shrugged.

“How long has the end of the world lasted?”

“What do you mean?”

"你经常和他们一起喝酒吗？" 律子皱着眉头问道。

"嗯，一周只有几个晚上。"

"这可不健康。对任何人都不健康。"

"拜托......现在是世界末日。"美里耸耸肩。

"世界末日持续了多久？"

"什么意思？"

“I mean, how long have you been back?” Misato had poured herself a beer and Ritsuko leaned over the bar to grab a bottle of whiskey.

“A few months. I found them—Shinji and Asuka—in November. Rei showed up in January.” She sighed. “And that’s it.”

“No Kaji, huh?”

“Oh, go to hell.”

“It was hard to return. The longer you’re in there, the harder it is, I think. You start to forget yourself.”

"我是说，你回来多久了？" 美里给自己倒了一杯啤酒，律子则俯身在吧台上拿了一瓶威士忌。

"几个月了。我在十一月发现了他们--真嗣和明日香。丽是一月份出现的。" 她叹了口气。"就这样"

"没有加持，嗯？"

"去死吧"

"很难回来。我觉得在里面待得越久就越难。你会开始忘记自己"

“I know. I remember.”

“It doesn’t hurt, but—“ Ritsuko shrugged. “It doesn’t feel good either.”

“Why did you come back, then?”

“I was lonely.”

“That’s what I thought.”

“Is it? In that place where no one is supposed to be lonely?”

"我知道。 我记得"

"在里面不会受伤，但是......" 律子耸耸肩 "感觉也不好"

"那你为什么回来？"

"我很孤独"

"我也是这么想的"

"是吗？在那个不应该有人孤独的地方？"

Misato took a long sip of beer.

“I think loneliness is—when you miss certain people. You can be with one person forever and never be lonely. Or you can feel torn apart by distance and solitude. It doesn’t matter.”

“For centuries, science discounted the existence of a soul in any significant, substantive way. And here we are. But there’s more to us than just a soul.”

“What do you mean?”

美里喝了一口啤酒。

"我觉得孤独就是--当你想念某些人的时候。你可以永远和一个人在一起，永远不会感到孤独。你也可以因为距离和孤独而感到支离破碎。这并不重要。"

"几个世纪以来，科学都不相信灵魂的存在。不相信它有任何重要的实质意义。 而我们在这里 ，但我们不仅仅只有灵魂。"

"什么意思？"

“So much of what we are exists between others,” Ritsuko shrugged. She found a rocks glass and poured out two-fingers. Then another two-fingers, for good measure. “I’m not me without the space between me and you. Ritsuko and Misato, I mean. I could be someone else, but without you, I’m not the me I know. And without Kaji and without—others.” She drained half the glass in a single gulp. “When I realized that, I knew I didn’t want to stay. Human Instrumentality was fundamentally flawed. A cruel, optimistic experiment to save mankind from itself, but I think, now, that it fundamentally misunderstood who we are. That’s what happens when people like Gendo Ikari try to decide the fate of the species.”

"我们的很多东西都存在于他人之间，"律子耸耸肩。她找来一个石杯，倒出两指深的酒。然后又倒了两指深。"没有你我之间的心之壁，我就不是我。我是说律子和美里。我可以是别人，但没有你们，我就不是我所认识的我。没有加持，没有其他人，我也不是我。" 她一口气喝干了半杯。"当我意识到这一点时，我知道我不想再待下去了。人类补完从根本上就存在缺陷。这是一项残酷而乐观的实验，旨在拯救人类自身，但我现在认为，它从根本上误解了我们是谁。这就是像碇源渡这样的人 试图决定人类命运的下场。"

“It’s actually been a lot of fun, you know. Being with them.”

They both turned to watch the teens in the booth. Asuka was holding forth on something; Shinji and Rei both looked skeptical. A bottle of expensive champagne—now worthless, of course—sat between them. Whenever Rei sipped from her flute, she scrunched up her face as the bubbles tickled her nose.

"这其实很有趣，你知道吗？和他们在一起。”

他们都转过身去看包间里的青少年。明日香在坚持着什么；真嗣和丽都一脸怀疑。他们中间放着一瓶昂贵的香槟--当然现在已经一文不值了。每当丽端起酒杯啜饮时，她都会因为气泡搔痒鼻子而皱起眉头。

“They’ve been fine, together?” Ritsuko asked.

“What do you mean?”

“No—conflicts?”

“Oh, normal kid stuff. Shinji and Asuka are together now, if you didn’t already figure that out.”

“Oh?”

“They’re cute. They can be very dramatic, though. Asuka especially, but you know how she is.”

"他们在一起一直都很好吗？" 律子问。

"什么意思？"

"没有冲突？"

"哦，正常的孩子之间的事。真嗣和明日香现在已经在一起了，如果你还没想明白的话。"

"哦？"

"他们很可爱。不过他们可能会很戏剧化。尤其是明日香，不过你也知道她的性格。"

Ritsuko drained the rest of her glass.

“I’d like to examine them. And you. None of you have had proper check-ups since returning, I’m guessing.”

“Well, Asuka did perform surgery on Rei.”

Ritsuko’s lips went flat. She reached for the bottle once more.

律子把杯中剩下的酒一饮而尽。

"我想检查一下他们。还有你们。 我猜你们回来后都没做过适当的检查吧。"

"嗯，明日香给丽做过了手术。"

律子的嘴唇抿得很平。她再次伸手去拿瓶子。

~

Ritsuko commandeered an office in the hospital. She suggested she take a look at Asuka first, as she had suffered the most extensive wounding during Third Impact.

“I don’t see why this is necessary,” Asuka scowled. She sat on a table, naked, blushing in spite of herself as the older women ran a finger over the scar tissue. “They’ve all healed. Shinji did a good job cleaning and dressing them when we first woke up.”

律子征用了医院的一间办公室。她建议先看看明日香，因为她在第三次撞击中受伤最严重。

"我不明白这有什么必要，"明日香皱着眉头说。她赤身裸体地坐在一张桌子上，当年长的女人用手指抚摸她的疤痕组织时，她不禁羞红了脸。"它们都已经愈合了。我们刚醒来的时候，真嗣给我们做了很好的清洁和包扎。"

“Shinji did?”

“Mhm. Turns out, he’s not totally useless.”

“Asuka, how have things been with Shinji?”

“Fine. It’s none of your business.”

Ritsuko sighed and smiled. Tense.

"真嗣做的？"

"嗯。原来他也不是一无是处。"

"明日香，你和真嗣怎么样了？

"很好，不关你的事。"

律子叹了口气，紧张地笑了笑。

“Have you two discussed what happened during Third Impact?”

“Obviously. It was all we could talk about at first.”

“What about before Third Impact?”

“What are you trying to get at?”

Ritsuko had been taking notes, but she set her clipboard down.

“I’m just trying to make sure you’re healthy, Asuka. In as many ways as possible.”

"你们俩讨论过第三次冲击时发生的事吗？"

"很明显。一开始我们只能谈论这个。"

"那第三次冲击之前呢？"

"你到底想说什么？"

律子一直在做笔记，但她放下了写字板。

"我只是想确保你身体健康，明日香。在尽可能多的方面。"

“No. That’s a dumb answer that only an adult would give. Just say it. Ask me what you want to ask me.”

“Asuka, while you were in a coma, after you ran away—“

“Mhm.”

“—it seems you may have been assaulted—in the hospital.”

“Mhm.”

"不，那是成年人才会说的蠢话。直说吧 问我你想问我什么。"

"明日香，在你离家出走之后你昏迷的时候..."

"嗯"

"似乎你在医院里受到侵犯"

"嗯"

Whatever reaction Ritsuko had been expecting, it wasn’t the grim, knowing smile on the red-head’s triumphant face.

“Hospital records indicate the only person who came to visit you was—Shinji. You had no male nurses, no male doctors, but you were almost certainly assaulted by someone male. Things began moving fast after that, and no one had a chance to act on it—SEELE attacked, and then Third Impact but—“

不管律子期待的是什么反应，红发女郎胜利的脸上都没有露出狰狞、明知故问的笑容。

"医院记录显示，唯一来看过你的人是真嗣。那里没有男护士，也没有男医生，但几乎可以肯定你是被男性侵犯的。之后事情开始迅速发展，没有人有机会采取行动--SEELE 袭击了你，然后是第三次冲击，但是--"

“It’s fine.”

“Asuka!”

“Dr. Akagi,” she whispered and her voice dripped with poison. “You could not possibly understand what I have been through. What NERV did to me my entire life. Don’t pick now to start caring about what happened to me. There’s so much you don’t know.”

"没事。"

"明日香！"

"赤木博士，"她低声说，声音里掺杂着毒药。"你不可能理解我所经历的一切。 NERV对我的一生做了什么。别挑现在才开始关心发生在我身上的事。你不知道的事情太多了。"

“Then tell me, Asuka.”

“No.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t owe you anything. I don’t owe NERV anything. I’m tired of adults telling me how to be.” She looked at the floor. “Shinji put himself through hell too.”

“Even so—“

"那就告诉我，明日香"

"不说"

"为什么？"

"我不欠你什么， 我也不欠NERV什么， 我已经厌倦了大人告诉我怎么做人" 她看着地板 "真嗣也把自己折磨得够呛。"

"即使如此"

“You should talk. We all saw it. In Instrumentality. What you did with Gendo. What your mother did. Why shouldn’t I be concerned for you? Shinji holds me when I cry now. He does everything for me. When I’m with him, somehow—I—I almost love myself.” She blushed and forced herself to turn away from Ritsuko. “Did Commander Ikari ever make you feel like that?”

Ritsuko seemed to deflate in her chair. Asuka collected her clothes and dressed.

“I feel bad for you.” She started towards the door and then stopped. “Also, not that it’s any of your business, but I would have let him. If I’d been awake. It doesn’t make it okay but there’s just so much you don’t know, Dr. Akagi. Stuff I did to him. While he was asleep. I hurt him too, so don’t look at me like I’m some tarnished little girl with Stockholm Syndrome. If you wanted to help me, you should have started a long time ago.”

"你才应该说出来。在人类补完里我们都看到了。 你对源渡做的事， 你母亲的所作所为， 我为什么不关心你？我哭的时候，真嗣会抱着我 ，他为我做了一切， 和他在一起的时候，不知怎么的，我几乎爱上了自己。她脸红了，强迫自己转过身去不看律子。"碇指挥官曾经让你有过这种感觉吗？"

律子似乎瘫坐在椅子上。明日香收起衣服，穿戴整齐。

"我为你感到难过。" 她开始走向门口，然后停了下来。"还有，这不关你的事，但我本来会让他这么做的。如果我醒着的话。这并不代表我就没事了，只是你不知道的事情太多了，赤木博士。我对他做的事 ，在他睡着的时候， 我也伤害了他 ，所以别把我看成得了斯德哥尔摩综合症的受玷污的小女孩。 如果你想帮我， 早就该开始了。"

Asuka passed Rei in the hall. Rei rose from the bench to go in for her exam, but Asuka took her by the shoulder and pressed her lips to her ear:

“Tell her about your theory.”

“Of course. I was planning on it.” Rei smiled. “I felt it would be too cruel to do that and slap her on top of it.”

明日香在大厅里与丽擦肩而过。丽从凳子上站起来，准备进去检查，但明日香揽住她的肩膀，把嘴唇贴在她耳边。

"告诉她你的看法"

"当然可以。我正有此意。" 丽微笑着说。"我觉得这样做太残忍了，就像打了她一巴掌。"

“Asuka really did an excellent job,” Ritsuko murmured in astonishment. Rei’s breathing sounded nearly perfect and her ribs had healed well. A few scars adorned her body but otherwise, you’d never known she’d been hit by a car six weeks prior.

“She saved my life,” Rei confirmed.

“You’re in great health.”

“I know. Shinji makes us nutritious meals and I try to get a moderate amount of exercise. And they were all quite attentive to my care while I recovered.”

"明日香真的做得非常出色。"律子惊讶地喃喃道。丽的呼吸声听起来近乎完美，她的肋骨也愈合得很好。她的身上有几处伤疤，但除此之外，你永远不会知道她在六周前曾被车撞过。

"她救了我的命。"丽确认道。

"你的身体很好。"

"我知道。真嗣给我们做营养餐，我也尽量适量运动。在我康复期间，他们都很细心地照顾我。"

“I’m glad to hear that, Rei. Really.”

Rei dressed.

“Dr. Akagi, I would like to ask you a question.”

“What’s that? Anything.”

“How aware were you of Yui Ikari’s involvement with the development of the EVA series?” The smile on Ritsuko’s face faltered. “Specifically, Unit 1.”

“She died during an experiment with it. You knew that.”

“Were you aware of Unit 1’s secret purpose?”

“What?”

“To act as a vessel in case of catastrophe. A final memorial, proving the humanity had existed, should the species be wiped out.”

"我很高兴听到你这么说，丽。真的。"

丽穿戴整齐。

"赤木博士，我想问你一个问题"

"什么问题？什么都行。"

"你对碇唯参与 EVA 系列的开发了解多少？" 律子脸上的笑容一僵。"特别是初号机"

"她在一次实验中死了。你知道的。"

"你知道 初号机的秘密用途吗？"

"什么？"

"作为灾难发生时的容器。作为最后的纪念，证明人类曾经存在过， 如果人类被消灭的话。"

“I—yes. I was vaguely aware of this idea. I don’t know to what extent Unit 1 was ever able to function exactly as Yui had intended. She and Fuyutsuki discussed this idea.”

“A way of saving her son, should the Human Instrumentality Project fail. Because she’d begun to lose faith in her husband. Seeking her mentor’s assistance to save the one person she loved more than anything.”

"是的，我。我隐约意识到了这个想法。我不知道 初号机在多大程度上能够完全按照唯的设想运行。她和冬月讨论过这个想法。"

"如果人类补完计划失败的话，这是救她儿子的方法。因为她开始对丈夫失去信心。寻求导师的帮助， 来拯救她最爱的人。"

“Rei,” Ritsuko whispered, shaking her head. “What’s your point?”

Rei told her, with a smile on her face. Ritsuko drew her face into her palms.

“Of course, we have no way of knowing for certain if it’s true or not,” Rei concluded. “However, it is interesting to think about.”

“Rei, why are you telling me this?”

“Interesting to think about how much a mother could love her child. To the exclusion of her husband. All of humanity, even.”

“Rei,” Ritsuko sobbed. “Stop. You’ve made your point.”

“I apologize for any distress this information may have caused you,” Rei said with a soft shrug.

"丽，"律子低声说，摇了摇头。"你想说什么？"

丽笑着对她说。律子把脸贴在手掌上。

"当然，我们无法确定这是真的还是假的。"丽总结道。"不过，想想还是很有趣的。"

"丽，你为什么要告诉我这些？"

"想想一个母亲有多爱她的孩子，这很有趣。甚至不爱自己的丈夫。甚至是全人类。"

"丽，"律子抽泣着说。"别说了。你已经说得很清楚了。"

"我为这些信息给你带来的困扰道歉。"丽轻轻耸了耸肩说。

Shinji entered Ritsuko’s makeshift office with a smile. After all, he had never had a bad experience with NERV’s doctor-in-chief, and bore her no specific ill will.

His examination lasted all of five minutes.

“You’re in perfect health,” Ritsuko said gloomily.

“Oh. Thank you. Are you sure?”

“You’re fine.”

“Okay. Sorry. Thank you.”

“Shinji.”

“Yes?”

“How have the last few months been? With the girls? They’re a lot, aren’t they?”

He shrugged. “Ayanami has opened up a lot. Asuka, well—did they tell you? That we’re, um—“ He blushed. “Together.”

真嗣微笑着走进律子的临时办公室。毕竟，他从未与 NERV 的主治医生有过不愉快的经历，对她也没有特别的恶意。

他的检查只持续了五分钟。

"你非常健康。"律子阴沉地说。

"哦，谢谢。你确定吗？"

"你很好。"

"好的，对不起。谢谢你。"

"真嗣"

"什么事？

"这几个月过得怎么样？和女孩们在一起？她们很多，不是吗？"

他耸了耸肩。"绫波开朗了很多。明日香，她们告诉你了吗？我们...... "他脸红了。"在一起了"

“Yes, Shinji. Asuka made that clear to me.”

“I think she’s okay. We talk, a lot. She’s really smart. I feel dumb, sometimes. A lot of the time.”

“That’s okay. Asuka is quite the girl.”

He smiled. “Yeah. She really is.”

“You like her a lot?”

"是的，真嗣。明日香跟我说得很清楚。"

"我觉得她没事。 我们经常聊天， 她真的很聪明， 有时候我觉得自己很笨 ，很多时候都是。"

"没关系， 明日香是个好女孩。"

他笑了 "是啊， 她真的很不错。"

"你很喜欢她？"

“Yes. I’m—“ He scratched the back of his head. His mannerisms were so unlike Gendo’s. “I guess I’m trying to become a guy worthy of her. She’d hate to hear me say that.”

“Shinji, women always fall in love with men who aren’t worthy of them. That’s the way of the world.”

“Misato says that too.”

“That’s because it’s true. Take care of her. Both of them.”

“Thank you,” he said with a grin and bowed.

“Shinji,” she asked as he dressed. “Do you—how do you—the guilt? What do you do about it?”

"是的，我...... "他抓了抓后脑勺。他的举止和源渡太不一样了。"我想我在努力成为一个配得上她的男人， 但她可不想听我这么说。"

"真嗣，女人总是会爱上配不上她们的男人。世界就是这样。"

"美里也这么说。"

"因为这是事实， 照顾好她， 两个都要照顾好。"

"谢谢。"他笑着说，然后鞠了一躬。

"真嗣，"她在他穿衣服时问道。"你--你有感到内疚吗？你是怎么做的？"

His face froze.

“I’m not mad. I’m asking for myself. I was complicit in atrocities. I’m asking after my soul.” She looked down at her clipboard. “I don’t know who else to ask.”

“I don’t know. Some days, it’s bad. Some days, you forget about it. But small things.” He chose his words carefully, spoke them slowly. “I can’t change what I did. But even if I’m in pain—maybe I can take care of someone else. We can’t change the past but even so—even so—“ Now, he smiled. “I don’t want to run away. That’s all I can say. We mustn’t run away.”

他的脸僵住了。

"我没有生气。我是在为自己求情。我是暴行的同谋 我在追问我的灵魂。" 她低头看着写字板 "我不知道还能问谁。"

"我也不知道。有些时候，情况很糟。有些时候，你会忘记它。但这都是小事。" 他小心翼翼地选词， 慢慢地说话。 "我无法改变我的所作所为， 但即使我很痛苦，也许我还能照顾别人。我们无法改变过去，但即便如此--即便如此--" 现在，他笑了 "我不想逃避。我只能这么说。我们不能逃避。"

~

Now, the seedlings were in bloom. Ritsuko became part of their lives: she moved into an empty apartment near Misato’s, on the same floor. She adopted a few stray cats. She came over after lunch every day to help Misato make sense of NERV’s legacy and stayed for dinner. She and Misato drank and smoked on the balcony till late in the night, laughing and crying and cursing the names of former lovers, gone but not forgotten.

现在，幼苗已经茁壮成长。律子成为了他们生活的一部分：她搬进了美里家附近的一间空公寓，就在同一层楼。她收养了几只流浪猫。每天午饭后，她都会过来帮助美里理解NERV的遗产，并留下来吃晚饭。她和美里在阳台上喝酒抽烟，直到深夜，笑着，哭着，咒骂着昔日恋人的名字，逝去了，但没有忘记。

The seedlings were in bloom. Touji, Kensuke, and Hikari appeared one day, wandering in an apocalyptic hangover up to the apartment.

“Maybe you don’t want to talk about it,” Hikari asked, holding Pen-Pen tight—he had left her family almost immediately after Third Impact, apparently, somehow waddling by himself back to the sanctuary of Misato’s apartment. They sat around the dining room table. The apartment was suddenly getting very tight. “But what happened?”

It was Rei’s idea to go to their school. They dressed, borrowing jackets and sweatshirts to ward off the early spring chills. After all, they had come back wearing their summer uniforms.

秧苗开花了。有一天，东治、剑介和光出现了，他们在末日的宿醉中徘徊着来到公寓。

光紧紧地抱着Pen-Pen问道："也许你不想谈这件事。"显然，Pen-Pen在 "第三次冲击 "之后几乎立刻就离开了她的家人，一个人莫名其妙地蹒跚着回到了美里公寓的避难所。他们围坐在餐桌旁。公寓的空间突然变得非常狭小。"但是发生了什么事？"

去学校是丽的主意。他们穿好衣服，借来外套和运动衫抵御初春的寒冷。毕竟，他们是穿着夏天的校服回来的。

They found their old classroom. The six of them took a few moments to feel at home there, amid the chalk dust.

“Okay!’ Asuka said, finally. “Listen up! This is Asuka Langley Soryu’s Guide to NERV, Human Instrumentality, and Third Impact. Save your questions till the end.”

She lectured for over an hour, with Shinji and Rei following behind her, correcting her kanji on the board whenever she made notes. She left out Rei’s theory. The advanced course, they silently agreed, could wait till another day.

In the end, they too moved into an empty apartment. Touji and Hikari began to share a bedroom and Kensuke would stay over at Misato’s till late, playing video games with the others. They, too, settled into the quiet waiting.

他们找到了以前的教室。在粉笔灰中，他们六人花了一些时间来感受家的感觉。

"好的！" 明日香终于开口了。"大家听好了！这是明日香-兰格雷-惣流的《NERV、人类补完和第三次冲击指南》。把你的问题留到最后吧。"

她讲了一个多小时，真嗣和丽跟在她身后，每当她做笔记时，就在黑板上纠正她的汉字。她漏掉了丽的理论。他们默默地同意，高级课程可以改天再讲。

最后，他们也搬进了空荡荡的公寓。东治和光开始共用一间卧室，而剑介则会在美里家待到很晚，和其他人一起玩电子游戏。他们也开始了安静的等待。

It happened, finally, late one night. It was impossible not to notice how impatient Misato had become once the other middle-schoolers showed up. After all—after all—

“He’ll come,” Ritsuko said one evening. “When you least expect him. Probably when it’s least convenient too.”

Still, she had begun to doubt.

And then—

“I thought you were banned from this place.”

事情终于发生了，在一个深夜。其他中学生一出现，美里就变得非常不耐烦，这让人无法不注意到。毕竟--毕竟--

一天晚上，律子说："他会来的。" "在你最不希望他来的时候。可能也是最不方便的时候。"

但她，还是开始怀疑。

然后—

"我以为你被禁止进入这里。"

He sat down hard next to her at the bar. She’d stolen away, in the middle of the night, to this place. Why that night, of all nights? Why had the loneliness reached its pitch on this, the night when he finally walked in?

“Just kicked out. I was never banned.” She paused. “You’re not real, Kaji. You’re a dream.”

He reached for her hand and placed it on his cheek.

“Real as can be.”

“Nevermind.”

He slid her hand under his shirt so she could feel the wound, still sticky.

他硬着头皮坐在吧台旁边。她半夜偷跑到这里来。为什么是那个夜晚？为什么在这个夜晚，当他终于走进来时，孤独感达到了顶点？

"只是被赶出来了。我从来没有被禁止过。" 她停顿了一下。"你不是真实的，加持。你是个梦。"

他伸手握住她的手，放在自己的脸颊上。

"真实无比。"

"没关系。"

他把她的手伸进他的衬衫里， 这样她就能摸到伤口，还粘粘的。

“See? Real. I hope you’ve got gauze at home.”

“How did you find me?”

“Even death couldn’t keep me from you.”

“What a lame line,” she said, but the words came out garbled because she was crying. “I missed you so hard.”

"看到了吗 真实的 。我希望你家里有纱布。"

"你是怎么找到我的？"

"即使死亡也无法将我与你隔绝。"

"多蹩脚的台词啊。"，她说，但说出来的话很乱，因为她在哭。"我想死你了。"

“I tried to come back as soon as I could.”

“You took your sweet time.”

“How long has it been?”

“Months. It’s March.”

“Seasons. There are seasons again, aren’t there?”

“I know. Isn’t it wonderful?”

“I can’t believe it. It’s like when we were kids.”

"我试着尽快赶回来。"

"你花了不少时间。"

"有多久了？"

"几个月了 ，现在是三月。"

"季节。又有季节了，不是吗？"

"我知道，这不是很美妙吗？"

"我简直不敢相信， 就像我们小时候一样。"

“They never got to experience it. Shinji, Rei, Asuka. They had their first real winter ever.”

“They’re back?”

“Mhm. You’ll see them in the morning. Until then—“

He pulled her close and she inhaled the scent of sweat and rain and LCL on his collar.

“Wasn’t there something you were going to say to me?”

“Oh. Right.”

“The words you couldn’t—or wouldn’t—say before?”

"他们从未经历过 真嗣、丽、明日香。 他们度过了有生以来第一个真正的冬天。"

"他们回来了？"

"嗯。明天早上你就能见到他们了。在那之前--"

他把她拉近，她吸着他衣领上的汗味、雨水味和 LCL 的味道。

"你不是有话要对我说吗？"

"哦，对。"

"你以前不能说或不愿说的话？"

“That’s right. I can’t quite remember what they were, though.” She swatted him and he leaned in to her ear. She took a sharp breath as he said them.

“Let’s go home, Kaji.”

“Home? But I just got here. Let me at least have a drink and a smoke first. No beer in that soup. No wonder you got out of there first chance you could.”

"没错， 不过我不太记得是什么了。" 她拍了他一下，他就凑到她耳边。他说这些话时，她猛吸了一口气。

"我们回家吧，加持。"

"回家？可我才刚到这儿。至少让我先喝杯酒，抽根烟。LCL海里没有啤酒。难怪你一有机会就逃出来了。"

~

The picnic was Kaji and Misato’s idea. After all, the kids had never known the world except in summer. Kaji and Shinji drove around for two weeks, observing cherry trees near the city, taking notes, and modifying their predictions for when they would bloom. Asuka had, at first, invited herself along on these trips, but couldn’t make herself care about botany to the extent that the boys did. For all his suave playboy attitude, Kaji was most at home when squatting in the dirt, measuring the growth of some stalk or other.

野餐是加持和美里的主意。毕竟，孩子们从未了解过夏天以外的世界。加持和真嗣开了两个星期的车，观察城市附近的樱花树，做笔记，并修改他们对樱花盛开时间的预测。明日香起初被邀请也参加这些旅行，但她无法像男孩们那样关心植物学。虽然加持是个风度翩翩的花花公子，但当他蹲在泥土里测量茎秆的生长情况时，他才是最自在的。

“Are all Japanese men like this?” Asuka had scowled to Misato one afternoon, returning from her first tree expedition. Much to her utter frustration, she had not been the center of attention.

"日本男人都这样吗？" 一天下午，明日香从她的第一次树上探险回来后，对美里皱起了眉头。令她非常沮丧的是，她并没有成为众人瞩目的焦点。

And then, the city exploded in pink. Flurries of blossoms, like snow, covered the ground, and the ne\xt afternoon, the little group of survivors—was this the right term? Misato had stopped calling the group “our little family,” finally, and the rest seemed to refer to themselves exclusively with a heavily weighted first-person plural pronoun: us, as opposed to them, still in the soup, maybe never coming back—convened on blankets underneath trees that wept flowers. Kaji produced a banner, as if by magic, that proclaimed this outing the “NERV COMPANY PICNIC, SPRING 2016.”

然后，整个城市都变成了粉红色。漫天飞舞的花朵像雪花一样铺满了大地，下午，幸存者小团体--这个称呼对吗？美里终于不再称这个小团体为 "我们的小家庭 "了，其余的人似乎只用加重了的第一人称复数代词来称呼自己：我们，而不是他们，他们还在LCL海里，也许再也回不来了--他们在花树下的毯子上召开了会议。加持像变魔术一样拿出了一面旗帜，上面写着 "NERV 公司野餐会，2016 年春天"。

Rei surprised everyone by showing up with a digital camera. She had taken it from an electronics shop and spent days staring at it, weighing it in her hands, learning its functions. As the party began, she ushered everyone together, beneath the banner. She balanced the camera in the crook of a tree branch, set the timer, and dashed back into the picture, posing with the others in the last second before it went off.

“It looks great,” Shinji told her as they sat on a blanket later. They looked through the photos she’d taken: pictures of herself, in a mirror; pictures of Shinji and Asuka, together, smiling, even kissing—when had she been spying on them?; pictures of Ritsuko, studies in sadness; pictures of Kensuke, Touji, and Hikari playing with Pen-Pen; pictures of herself, naked. “Maybe delete those.”

丽带着一台数码相机出现在大家面前，让所有人都大吃一惊。她从一家电子商店拿来这台数码相机，盯着它看了好几天，用手掂量着它的重量，学习它的功能。派对开始时，她把大家带到横幅下。她把相机放在树枝的弯角处，设定好计时器，然后冲回画面，在计时器响起前的最后一秒和大家一起摆好姿势。

"他们后来坐在毯子上时，真嗣告诉她："看起来很棒。他们翻看了她拍的照片：镜子里的自己；真嗣和明日香在一起的照片，微笑，甚至接吻--她什么时候偷窥他们了？ 律子的照片，愁眉苦脸的做着研究；剑介、冬治和光一起玩Pen-Pen的照片；自己的裸照。"也许应该删掉这些"。

Touji had brought a soccer ball. Teams were formed, with Asuka, Kaji, and Kensuke on one side and Misato, Touji, and Hikari, who had been roped in at the last minute, on the other side. Shinji had made dumplings and he was unloading them when Ritsuko drew Rei away from the blankets.

“I wanted to ask you something,” she said, once they were under the dance of blossoms, out of ear range of the others.

冬治带来了一个足球。大家组成了一队，明日香、加持和剑介在一边，美里、冬治和最后一刻才加入的光在另一边。真嗣已经包好了饺子，当律子把丽从被子里拉出来时，他正在下饺子。

她说："我想问你一件事，"等他们来到花舞之下，离开其他人的耳朵范围后，她说。

“Yes, Dr. Akagi?”

“I haven’t floated this to Misato and Kaji yet. If anything, you could say I’ve hidden it from them. I found some emails—between Yui and Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu. Yui is quite explicit with what she’s planning and Kyoko suggests she would try something similar, if it seemed that Asuka would be chosen.”

Rei let her gaze rest on Ritsuko’s face, not changing her expression in the slightest.

“So?”

“So, that means this might not be Shinji’s dream. It could be Asuka’s.”

“Or,” Rei said after a few seconds. “It could be real.”

“You knew. You knew, didn’t you? Why didn’t you tell them?”

"什么事，赤木博士？

"我还没有把这件事告诉美里和加持。 可以说，我对他们隐瞒了这件事。我发现了一些唯和齐柏林—惣流—京子之间的电子邮件。唯很明确地说出了她的计划，而京子则表示，如果明日香似乎会被选中的话，她也会尝试类似的做法。"

丽让目光停留在律子的脸上，丝毫没有改变她的表情。

"所以呢？"

"所以，这意味着这可能不是真嗣的梦。可能是明日香的梦。"

"或者，"几秒钟后，丽说。"可能是真的"

"你知道的。你知道的，不是吗？你为什么不告诉他们？"

“After I saw how much trouble telling them the first part of my theory caused, I decided not to bother with the other possibilities. Besides—“ And now she smiled. “I realized it simply doesn’t matter. Even if it’s a dream. That doesn’t mean this isn’t real. It’s only a different kind of real than we’re used to considering.”

“Will you ever tell them?”

“Perhaps. Someday. But it’s only a theory.” She took a deep breath. “I took pictures today, of them and us, for them to hold onto. It’s all for those two. So we won’t fade away.”

"在我看到告诉他们我的理论的第一部分会造成多大麻烦之后，我决定不再费心考虑其他可能性了。此外--"现在她笑了。"我意识到这根本不重要。即使这只是一个梦。这并不意味着这不是真实的。"这只是一种我们习惯考虑的不同的真实。"

"你会告诉他们吗？"

"也许吧。总有一天。但这只是一种理论。" 她深吸了一口气。"我今天拍了他们和我们的照片，给他们留念。都是为了他们俩。 这样我们就不会消失了。"

“Is that all we can do? Or are we just—just resigned to be the dreams of some distant god?”

“No.”

“What else can we do?”

“Cling together,” she whispered. “And find each other in the dark. That’s all anyone’s ever been able to do.”

"这就是我们能做的吗？还是我们只能甘心做遥远神灵的梦境？"

"不"

"我们还能做什么？"

"依偎在一起，" 她低声说 "在黑暗中找到彼此， 这是所有人都能做到的。"

Rei rejoined Shinji on the blanket. He gave her a vegetable dumpling, but it was too hot and she held it on her tongue, sucking at the air.

“Here, have some sake!” he cried, laughing, and handed her a small cup. She threw it back and found the combination of cold sake and hot dumpling quite exquisite.

“Thank you, Ikari,” she said.

“What did Dr. Akagi need? She seemed really—serious. I guess that’s how she always is.”

丽重新坐到真嗣毯子边上。他给了她一个蔬菜饺子，但是太烫了，她用舌头舔着，吸着空气。

"来，喝点清酒！"他笑着喊道，并递给她一小杯。她把酒一口闷，发现冷清酒和热饺子的搭配非常美妙。

"谢谢你，碇君。"她说。

"赤木博士在干什么？她看起来很认真。我猜她总是这样。"

Rei shrugged. “She had some questions about the fundamental nature of this reality. It was nothing important.”

“Right.” Shinji sighed. “Rei, do you really think this world could be real? The real real-world, I mean. Not just a dream.”

“Yes. It could.”

“But do you think it is? Really?”

“Ikari,” she whispered, turning to him. “Has any moment of this world ever felt less than real?”

“I… I don’t know.”

丽耸了耸肩。"她对这个现实世界的基本性质有些疑问。没什么大不了的。"

"没错。" 真嗣叹了口气。"丽，你真的认为这个世界是真实的吗？我是说真实的世界 ，而不仅仅是个梦。"

"是的，有可能"

"但你认为它是真的吗？你真的这么认为？"

"碇君，"她低声说，转向他。"在这个世界上，有没有哪一刻让你觉得不那么真实？"

"我......我不知道。"

She leaned into him, over the dumplings and sake. The bottle tipped over, leaking wine onto the blanket as she kissed him. His lips tasted of pork dumpling, but she would forgive him that.

“Ayanami,” he whispered. She smiled.

“Did that feel real?”

“Yes.”

“Isn’t that all that matters?”

“Shinji! You bastard!”

Asuka had seen.

她靠在他身上，越过饺子和清酒。当她吻他时，酒瓶翻倒了，酒漏到了毯子上。他的嘴唇有猪肉饺子的味道，但她会原谅他的。

"绫波，"他低声说。她笑了

"感觉真实吗？"

"是的。"

"这不是最重要的吗？"

"真嗣 你这个混蛋！"

明日香看到了。

“And this, too,” Rei continued as Asuka came charging at them. Shinji leapt to his feet and grabbed her by the hand. “Doesn’t this feel real?”

“Let’s run, Ayanami!” he cried, though he was laughing and soon she was too as Asuka sprinted after them.

“Check it out!” Touji roared. “Shinji’s two-timing Asuka! I knew it would happen!” Next to him, Hikari had balled up her fists, using this as an opportunity to escape the soccer game.

丽继续说道："还有这个。"这时明日香向他们冲了过来。真嗣一跃而起，抓住了她的手。"这感觉不真实吗？"

"我们跑吧，绫波！"他哭着喊道，然后他笑了起来，很快她也笑了，因为明日香在他们身后冲刺。

"快来看！" 东治吼道。"真嗣对明日香不忠！我就知道会这样！" 在他旁边，光握紧了拳头，东治趁机逃离了足球比赛。

“You jerk, Ikari! How could you do that to your girlfriend?!”

Rei and Shinji darted through the cherry trees, laughing and panting.

“Shinji, I’m gonna’ nail you to one of these trees!” Asuka screamed. “I’m gonna’ fry you like a dumpling!”

“I don’t think I can run much longer,” Shinji panted to Rei.

“Then stop running.”

“What do I do instead?”

She whispered in his ear.

“Will that work?”

"八嘎新机！你怎么能这样对你的女朋友！"（ヾ(≧▽≦*)o）

丽和真嗣在樱花树下飞奔，又笑又喘。

"真嗣，我要把你钉在这些树上！" 明日香尖叫道。"我要把你煎成饺子！"

"我想我跑不动了" 真嗣气喘吁吁地对丽说

"那就别跑了。"

"那我该怎么办？"

她在他耳边低语。

"这样行吗？"

She nodded and darted off. Shinji called back to her:

“Now? Here?” Rei turned to nod at him before disappearing behind a veil of flowers.

A second later, Asuka collided with him but he slipped the first blow she aimed at his face and caught her around the waist. He lifted her up as she squealed and kissed her. They spun, under the blanket of fragile blossoms, and slowly, her fists relaxed and found his hair, holding him.

她点点头，飞快地跑开了。真嗣回头叫住了她：

"现在？"丽转过身对他点点头，然后消失在花纱后面。

一秒钟后，明日香与他撞在了一起，但他躲过了明日香瞄准他脸部的第一击，并抓住了她的腰部。在她的尖叫声中，他把她举了起来，并吻了她。他们在脆弱的花毯下旋转，慢慢地，她的拳头放松了，找到了他的头发，抱住了他。

“Idiot. You’re such a jerk,” she muttered.

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“Stop with that.” She kissed him again. “Hey, idiot. Do you want to know a secret?” She pressed her lips to his ear: “Today, I’m really happy.”

“About that,” he said, lowering her. He reached into his pocket. “You’ll think this is dumb but I’ve been thinking about it and—“

Asuka collapsed into him. A sobbing squeal erupted from her lips.

"八嘎。你真是个混蛋。"她嘟囔道。

"我知道，对不起。对不起。"

"别这样" 她又吻了他 "嘿，八嘎心机， 你想知道一个秘密吗？" 她把嘴唇贴在他耳边 "今天，我真的很开心。"

"关于这个，"他说着，放下了她。他把手伸进口袋 "你会觉得这很蠢，但我一直在想......"

明日香瘫倒在他身上。她的嘴里发出了呜咽的尖叫声。

When they rejoined the group—everyone had made their way back to the blankets; the soccer game had ended without a winner—Shinji’s arm was around her waist. She couldn’t make herself speak; any time she did, she started to cry.

Because someone wanted to be with her, forever. She covered her face with her arm but held up her hand, the diamond ring catching the light.

“Hey,” Kaji roared, standing up. “Congratulations!”

Misato joined him, starting to clap. “Congratulations!”

Now Ritsuko too: “Congratulations!”

The others too—

“Congatulations!”

当他们重新回到队伍中时--大家都回到了毯子上；足球比赛没有分出胜负--真嗣的胳膊搂着她的腰。她说不出话来，一说就哭。

因为有人想和她在一起，永远在一起。她用手臂遮住脸，但还是举起了手，钻石戒指在灯光下闪闪发光。

"嘿，"加持站起来吼道。"欧妹得多！"

美里也加入了他的行列，开始鼓掌。"欧妹得多！"

律子也鼓起掌来 "欧妹得多！"

其他人也是

"欧妹得多！"（就决定这么翻了，鼓掌鼓掌不要停\(￣︶￣*\)）

~

Misato sat with Kaji. Shinji sat with Asuka. Touji sat with Hikari. Sake passed hands. Ritsuko found herself sitting with a bespectacled boy. She wasn’t sure if they’d ever exchanged more than two words.

“So, you were in charge of the EVAs?” he said, suddenly. She stared at him and blinked a few times.

“Sort of. It was a very complicated undertaking.”

“But, like, you know all about them?”

“As much as anyone does.”

“Awesome,” Kensuke sighed. “I tried to get Shinji and the others to tell me stuff but they don’t really want to talk about it. I guess I understand that.”

“I can answer any questions you have.”、

美里和加持坐在一起。真嗣和明日香坐在一起。 东治和光坐在一起。清酒擦肩而过。律子发现自己和一个面容清秀的男孩坐在一起。她不确定他们之间的交流是否超过两句话。

"那么，你是 EVA 的负责人？"他突然说。她盯着他，眨了几下眼睛。

"算是吧。这是一项非常复杂的工作。"

"但是，你对它们了如指掌？"

"和其他人一样了解。"

"真棒。"剑介叹了口气。"我试着让真嗣他们告诉我一些事情，但他们并不想谈。我想我能理解。"

"我可以回答你的任何问题。"

“Wow, really? Can we start from the beginning—“ and Kensuke launched into a maddeningly detailed question that Ritsuko needed him to repeat before she understood it. Somewhere, later that evening, after many questions and answers, she looked at him and cocked her head to the side.

“You’re definitely too young for me.”

He laughed and blushed. “Well, I’m fifteen now.”

“Way too young. I’m twenty-nine, you know.”

“That’s not so bad.”

The gap between her and Gendo, after all, had been greater.

“You know,” she said suddenly. “You’re right. It’s not so bad.

"哇，真的吗？我们能从头开始吗--"剑介开始了一个令人抓狂的详细问题，律子需要重复说一遍他才能听懂。那天晚上，在某个地方，经过多次问答之后，她看着他，把头偏向一边。

"对我来说，你肯定太年轻了。"

他笑了，脸红了。"我已经十五岁了。"

"太年轻了。我都29岁了，你知道的。"

"那也不算太糟。"

毕竟，她和源渡之间的差距更大。

"你知道，"她突然说。"你是对的。没那么糟糕。"（汗...(lll￢ω￢)）

~

This was the hardest thing Rei had ever done.

Asuka and Hikari attempted to help her, but it was no use.

“You’re not scared of anything,” Asuka groaned.

“But this,” Rei said. “This is terrifying.”

“It’s just karaoke! You just pick a song and sing the words on the screen!” Hikari repeated. “No one’s a professional singer so it’s fun.”

“I had vocal training as a child,” Asuka announced to no one in particular.

这是丽做过的最艰难的事情。

明日香和光试图帮助她，但没有用。

"你什么都不怕。"明日香呻吟道。

"但是这个，"丽说 "这太可怕了。"

"这只是卡拉 OK！你只要选一首歌，然后唱出屏幕上的歌词就行了！" 光又重复了一遍。"没人是专业歌手，所以很有趣。"

"我小时候接受过声乐训练。"明日香对所有人宣布。

After night had fallen, the party moved to a karaoke bar. Ritsuko had muttered something about using all of her degrees and hacking skills to jerry rig a free karaoke machine for them.

“And god said, ‘Let there be karaoke!’” she declared in triumph, taking a bow as the machine sprung to life and stopped asking them for money.

“I want to sing this one,” Rei pointed to the screen.

“Then pick it.”

夜幕降临后，聚会转移到了一家卡拉 OK 吧。律子嘟囔着要用她所有的学位和黑客技术为他们偷换一台免费的卡拉 OK 机。

"神说：'让我们唱卡拉 OK 吧！'"她胜利地宣布，当卡拉 OK 机启动并停止向他们要钱时，她鞠了一躬。

"我想唱这首。"丽指着屏幕。

"那就选吧。"

Her fingers trembled but after more encouragement, she finally did. She stood on the little stage as her friends clapped, cheered her name, and she began to sing. She gripped the microphone as if she were strangling it.

“What a weird choice,” Misato murmured to Kaji. “This is a really old song, isn’t it? How does she know it?”

“’Fly Me to the Moon.’ It’s Frank Sinatra. It’s a karaoke classic,” Kaji scoffed.

When she finished, everyone clapped and she bowed. She joined Shinji and Asuka in their booth.

她的手指在颤抖，但在大家的鼓励下，她终于唱了起来。她站在小舞台上，朋友们为她鼓掌，欢呼她的名字，她开始唱歌。她紧紧抓住麦克风，仿佛要把它勒死。

"真是个奇怪的选择。"美里喃喃地对加持说。"这首歌很老了吧？她怎么知道的？"

"《飞向月球》。是弗兰克-辛纳屈的歌。这是卡拉 OK 的经典歌曲。"加持嘲笑道。

她唱完后，大家都鼓起掌来，她也鞠了一躬。她和真嗣、明日香一起来到了他们的包间。

“Ayanami, you did it!”

“Yes. Yes, I did do it,” she nodded. “This is fun.”

They watched Misato slur her way through “Can You Celebrate?” At one point, she dragged Kaji onstage with her and sang to him.

“I would like to ask you both something,” Rei said, dropping her voice low.

“What?” the other two pilots asked, nearly in unison. Something dark seemed to be at the edge of her request.

“If you are ever very, very far from me. If I’m ever lost to you. Will you please, please, please come and find me?”

"绫波，你做到了！"

"是的，是的，我做到了。"她点了点头。"真有趣"

他们看着美里口齿不清地唱着 "你能庆祝吗？" 有一次，她把加持拉上台，对着他唱歌。

"我想问你们俩一件事。"丽压低声音说。

"什么？"另外两名驾驶员几乎异口同声地问。她的请求边缘似乎有什么黑暗的东西。

"如果有一天你们离我很远很远。如果有一天我失去了你。请你，请你，请你来找我好吗？"

Shinji was the first to promise.

“Ayanami, of course.”

“It may be very far. A soul can never be destroyed. It can only be near or far.”

“We won’t let it stop us, dummy,” Asuka said and rolled her eyes. “We’ll find you. But don’t go wandering off?”

“Of course not.” She grinned. “I don’t want to be apart from you.”

真嗣第一个答应了。

"当然，绫波。"

"可能会很远， 灵魂永远不会被毁灭， 它只能或近或远的存在。"

"我们不会让它阻止我们的，笨蛋。"明日香说着翻了个白眼。"我们会找到你的。但别到处乱跑？"

"当然不会。" 她咧嘴一笑。"我不想和你分开。"

### Epilogue: "Do you want to kiss?"

At one point, several millennia into its journey, the strange craft met another vessel. These wayfarers, confused by what they saw, consulted their elders and oracles. The conclusion was reached: whatever this thing was, it carried an aura of sorrow about it. It was not to be touched. They bade it safe passage on its journey, and prayed for it to find peace.

在几千年的旅程中，这艘奇特的飞船与另一艘船相遇了。这些旅行者被眼前的景象弄糊涂了，他们向长者和神灵请教。得出的结论是：不管这艘船是什么，它都带着悲伤的气息。不能碰它。他们祝愿它一路平安，并祈祷它能找到安宁。

Shinji gasped. His bones ached. His muscles ached. His mouth tasted like stale LCL, which he didn’t even realize was a thing.

He was awake. The dream burned still, bright in his memory, but its vivid edges had faded.

真嗣喘着粗气。他的骨头疼。他的肌肉疼痛。他的嘴里有陈旧的 LCL 的味道，他甚至没有意识到这是一种什么东西。

他醒了。梦还在燃烧，在他的记忆中闪闪发光，但其生动的边缘已经褪去。

“No,” he whispered. “No. No.” He slid his hands over his face. He still wore a plug suit. He was alone in Unit 1. “No.” He noted the date on the dashboard—December 2, 14022. That had to be wrong.

Now, Unit 1 released him into the sparkling light of a new world. He took a slow breath. Air. He could breathe. Well, that was something.

And here was something else: a red machine, clinging to Unit 1. Dusty and faded on this alien planet. It was impossible. It couldn’t be—

Now he was scrambling down Unit 1’s jagged body, over to Unit 2. It responded to his touch, and with a hiss, the cockpit ejected. It burned his hands, but he didn’t care—something was stuck but after a moment’s prying, the plug yielded its treasure.

"不。" 他低声说 "不， 不。" 他用手捂着脸， 他仍然穿着驾驶服。只有他一个人在初号机 "不。" 他记下了仪表盘上的日期--14022年12月2日。这一定是错的。（飞跃巅峰了？ㄟ( ▔, ▔ )ㄏ）

现在，初号机把他释放到了一个闪闪发光的新世界。他缓缓地吸了一口气。空气。他可以呼吸了。好吧，这是件好事。

这里还有别的东西：一台红色的机器，紧紧抱着 初号机。尘土飞扬，在这个外星球上褪色了。这不可能 ，不可能。

现在，他顺着 初号机嶙峋的躯体爬向 2 号机。它对他的触碰做出了反应， 随着一声嘶嘶声 ，驾驶舱弹了出来， 他的手被灼伤了，但他并不在意--有什么东西卡住了，但撬了一会儿之后，插入栓就露出了它的宝藏。

Please, he prayed. Please, please, please, please—

Asuka yawned. She sat forward and stretched.

“Hey, idiot,” she said when she saw him. The smile, starting to form on her face, drifted away as she looked past the tears streaming down his cheeks to the arid, empty landscape of red sand stretching out all around them, to the dual suns hanging in the sky overhead, to the sky, an unnatural purple-pink.

“Where are we?”

求求你，他祈祷着。求求你，求求你，求求你--

明日香打了个哈欠。她向前坐了坐，伸了个懒腰。

"嘿，八嘎新机，"她看到他时说。当她的目光越过他脸颊上流下的泪水，望向他们周围那一片干旱空旷的红沙，望向头顶上悬挂在天空中的两个太阳，望向那一片不自然的紫粉色的天空时，她脸上开始形成的笑容渐渐消失了。

"我们这是在哪儿？"

They sat together, slumped against the machines. It took a long time for either of them to find the words for their situation.

“I guess this means you saved me,” she said, finally. She looked up from the cage of her forearms. “Do you remember?” She started to take the plug suit off. She was half-naked, bare from the ribs up, before she realized what she was doing and kicked him. “Don’t look, pervert!”

他们坐在一起，斜靠在机器上。过了很久，两人都找不到合适的词来形容自己的处境。

"我猜这意味着你救了我，"她最后说。她从插入栓的前端里抬起头。"你还记得吗？" 她开始脱驾驶服。在她意识到自己在做什么前踢了他一脚，她已经半裸了，肋骨以上都光着。"别看，变态！"

“Asuka, your scars.”

“They’re gone,” she said. “They’re actually gone. That means—“

“I guess I made it in time.” He looked at his hands and then back at her. She was crying.

“You jerk. You actually did it. You didn’t leave me out there alone.” She flung herself at him, arms meeting his neck, and cackled and cried and buried her face into him. “You idiot. You idiot. You saved me. You saved me. I can’t believe you saved me.”

"明日香，你的伤疤。"

"它们不见了。"她说。"它们真的消失了。这意味着......"

"我想我来得及" 他看了看自己的手，又看了看她。她哭了

"你这个混蛋， 你真的做到了。 你没有把我一个人留在外面。" 她扑向他，双臂抱住他的脖子，咯咯地笑着，哭着，把脸埋进他的身体里。"八嘎新机！八嘎新机！你救了我。你救了我。真不敢相信你救了我！"

Slowly, they began to piece together what happened—

Shinji had launched in Unit 1, at the last moment, burning with guilt and shame. Misato’s words echoing in his cowardly heart. Her cross pendant was still around his neck.

They had fought, together. Side by side. The mass-produced EVAs were no match. As Asuka had predicted, they were unstoppable.

慢慢地，他们开始拼凑出发生了什么--

真嗣在最后一刻发射了初号机，内心充满了愧疚和羞耻。美里的话回荡在他懦弱的心中。她的十字架吊坠还挂在他的脖子上。

他们一起战斗过， 并肩作战， 量产型EVA根本不是对手， 正如明日香所预料的那样，他们势不可挡。

When it became clear that Third Impact would fail, that death was the only other option, the EVAs offered them another choice—leave. Shinji and Asuka clung to one another as Unit 1 rose into the air, soared past Lilith’s face, and disappeared into the stars. Somewhere along the way, they had passed out and begun to dream, kept alive in their mothers’ wombs for thousands of years.

当 "第三次冲击 "显而易见地失败，死亡是唯一的选择时，EVA为他们提供了另一个选择--离开。当 初号机升空，掠过莉莉丝的脸庞，消失在星空中时，真嗣和明日香紧紧抱在一起。一路上，他们昏昏沉沉，开始做梦，在母亲的子宫里存活了数千年。

“But where are we?” Shinji asked now.

“Look.” She pointed at the two suns. “There’s no way this is in the Milky Way galaxy.”

“Did you see what the year was?”

“What was it?”

“I thought it was a mistake.”

“Shinji, what was it? What year is it?”

He told her and her face went blank. Then, she began to laugh.

"但我们在哪里？" 信治问道。

"你看。" 她指着两个太阳 "这里不可能是银河系。"

"你看到那是什么年份了吗？"

"是什么？"

"我以为是搞错了。"

"真嗣，那是什么？现在是哪一年？"

他告诉她时，她的脸变得茫然。 然后，她开始笑了。

“Of course! Of course! Of course, we end up on the other side of the universe, on a desert planet, after sleeping for twelve-thousand years. Thanks a lot, NERV!”

“I think it was our mothers,” Shinji said. They had begun to hold hands at some point and when Asuka followed his gaze to their intertwined fingers, she jerked away from him. “They sacrificed themselves to keep us safe from NERV. Asuka?”

She was crying again. He hesitated and then put his arm around her.

"当然！当然 当然，我们沉睡了一万两千年后， 最终来到了宇宙的另一端， 一个沙漠星球上 ，多谢了，NERV！"

"我觉得是我们的母亲，"真嗣说。他们不知何时开始牵起手来，当明日香顺着他的目光看到他们交缠的手指时，她猛地挣脱了他。"为了保护我们免受 NERV 的伤害，她们牺牲了自己。明日香？"

她又哭了。他犹豫了一下，然后搂住了她。

“She loved me, didn’t she? That’s why she did it,” Asuka whispered. “Shinji, tell me that’s why.”

“That’s why.” He felt his face start to crumble into tears too. “They loved us. Someone loves us.”

Suddenly, Asuka drew away from him. She began to wipe her face, frantically, as if her tears burned her.

"她爱我，不是吗？所以她才那么做的。"明日香低声说道。"真嗣，告诉我这就是原因。"

"这就是原因。" 他觉得自己也开始泪流满面。"他们爱我们。有人爱我们。"

突然，明日香从他身边挣脱开来。她开始慌乱地擦拭自己的脸，仿佛泪水灼伤了她。

“I had a dream. In there. Did you have the same dream?”

“I think… Maybe. Yes?”

“A lot happened in it.”

“Yeah.”

She frowned. “I don’t know if we had the same dream.”

“You made me promise something in it.”

“I made you promise a lot of things.”

"我做了个梦。 在里面。 你也做了同样的梦吗？"

"我想......也许吧。是吗？"

"里面发生了很多事。"

"是的。"

她皱起了眉头 "我不知道我们做的是不是同一个梦。"

"你在梦里让我承诺了一些事。"

"我让你承诺了很多事。"

“To come and find you, if I woke up.” He felt the goofy grin forming on his lips. “I kept my promise. I only had to walk a few feet to do it, though.”

“True, but you said you’d come up with a good line for when you did. I’m waiting, Third Child.”

He started and stopped a few times. Finally, he gave in to what he always knew it would be—

“Do you want to kiss?”

“Oh, you’re so lame. Have you brushed your teeth?”

“Not for twelve-thousand years.”

“Gross. Well, it can’t be helped. Here I come—“

"如果我醒了，就来找你" 他觉得自己的嘴角露出了傻笑。"我信守了诺言。不过我只走了几步路就到了。"

"没错，但你说过你会想出一句好台词的。我等着呢，八嘎新机。"

他走了几次，又停了几次。最后，他屈服于他一直知道会发生的事--

"你想接吻吗？"

"哦，你真没劲。你刷牙了吗？"

"一万两千年没刷了。"

"真恶心。 那也没办法， 我来了~ "

Now they lay in the shade afforded them by the massive mechanical beasts. Arms around each other.

“I can’t believe that was all a dream,” she said. “Some of it was ridiculous, of course.”

“When you performed surgery on Ayanami.”

“What? I could totally do that.”

“Sure.”

“You don’t believe me!”

“I’ll believe it when I see it.”

现在，他们躺在巨大机械怪兽为他们提供的阴凉处。双臂环抱着对方。

"真不敢相信这一切都是梦，" 她说 "当然其中有些很荒谬。"

"你给绫波做手术的时候。"

"什么？ 我完全可以做到。"

"当然。"

"你不相信我！"

"我看到了就会相信。"

“Just wait till you get sick and I save your stupid life, jerk.” They rocked softly with laughter. “Hey, Shinji—“

“Hm?”

“What happened, in the hospital room? You can tell me. I won’t be mad. I just want to know.”

He told her and she sighed.

“That’s all? You’re gross.”

“I felt awful.”

“And you made up something worse for the dream.”

“And you—“

“Never happened. But—it could have.”

"就等着你生病 我救你一命吧， 八嘎新机。" 他们笑着轻轻摇晃 "嘿，真嗣。"

"嗯？"

"在病房里发生了什么？你可以告诉我。我不会生气的， 我只是想知道。"

他告诉了她，她叹了口气。

"就这样？你真恶心。"

"我感觉糟透了。"

"你还编了个更可怕的梦。"

"你......"

"从没发生过。 但有可能发生。"

“I think the dream was our minds coming to terms with everything. What we are. What we hate about ourselves.”

“Look at Dr. Freud here.”

“I’m serious! And—“ He fell silent. “Ayanami.”

“What about her?” Her voice was little more than a whisper.

“What did she say to us at the end?”

"我认为，梦是我们的心灵在接受一切。我们是什么 。我们对自己的憎恨什么。"

"看看弗洛伊德博士。"

"我是认真的！ 还有......" 他沉默了 "绫波。"

"她怎么了？" 她的声音比耳语还小

"她最后对我们说了什么？"

“She made us promise to come find her if she disappeared. And she said… something really metaphysical. About how souls can only be near or far. Never made, never destroyed.”

“Yeah. Like maybe she was… calling to us.” Shinji sat up. Asuka grunted as she lost the pillow of his chest. “Asuka, what now?”

“I don’t know.”

“Seriously?”

“What do you want me to say, Shinji?”

“I—I—I want you to get mad!” he cried. “I want you to be a bitch! I want you to lecture me about being a man and tell me how we’re going to get back in the EVAs and find Ayanami and the others. I want you to yell at me about how we’re unstoppable together!”

"她让我们保证， 如果她失踪了就去找她 ，她还说了......一些很玄乎的话。关于灵魂是如何只能靠近或远离的 事情，灵魂永远不会被创造，也永远不会被毁灭。"

"是啊 也许她是在......呼唤我们。" 真嗣坐了起来。明日香闷哼了一声，因为她失去了他胸前的枕头。"明日香，现在怎么办？"

"我也不知道"

"真的吗？"

"你想让我说什么，真嗣？"

"我，我，我想让你生气！"他哭着说。"我要你像个婊子一样！我要你教训我，要我像个男子汉，告诉我我们该如何回到 EVA 找到绫波他们。我要你对我大喊大叫 我们在一起是多么势不可挡！"

She looked away from him.

“I don’t know if I can do that. I’m tired. I’m so tired of this.” She closed her eyes. “I want to give up. I—ah!”

Shinji had grabbed her, pulled her to her feet, pulled her into the sun.

“Asuka!” he yelled in her face. “Asuka! Asuka!”

“What?” she screamed back. “What? What do you want from me?”

“I love you!”

“I love you too! Why are we yelling?”（-为什么我们要喊出来？233）

她把目光从他身上移开。

"我不知道我能不能做到。我累了， 我厌倦了这一切。" 她闭上了眼睛。"我想放弃。我--啊！"

真嗣抓住了她，把她拉到脚边， 把她拉到了阳光下。

"明日香！"他对着她的脸大喊 "明日香！明日香！"

"什么？"她尖叫着回答 "什么？你想从我这里得到什么？"

"我爱你！"

"我也爱你， 我们为什么要大喊大叫？"

“Because we can do anything!”

She reached up to hold his neck as she let out a sobbing breath.

“You think so?” she whispered. “You really think so? Shinji, is this real? Is it real this time?”

She pushed him away.

“You really think that I want to do this with you?”

“Asuka—“

“You really think,” and now she was yelling. “I fell in love with you in a stupid dream? You really think I forgive you for being a gross jerk?”

“Asuka—“

"因为我们无所不能！"

她一边发出呜咽声，一边伸手抱住他的脖子。

"你这么想？"她低声说。"你真的这么想？真嗣，这是真的吗？这次是真的吗？"

她推开了他。

"你真的认为我想和你做这个？"

"明日香—"

"你真的以为"，现在她在大喊大叫。"我是在一个愚蠢的梦里爱上你的？你真以为我会原谅你这个混蛋？"

"明日香—"

“You really think I want wander across space with you one more time?” she cried, squeezing her hands into fists and doubling over. “You really think I want to fight the structures of reality itself with you? You really think I want to find our friends with you? You really think I want to pry their stupid, undeserving, ungrateful souls out of some sort of hole that I can’t even fathom yet? You really think I want to break this universe with you, just to save the people we love?”

He grinned as she turned to him. She laid a hand on her chest, panting, cheeks wet, eyes red.

"你真以为我还想再和你一起漫步太空吗？"她哭着说，双手紧握成拳，两眼翻白。"你真的以为我想和你一起对抗现实本身吗？你真的以为我想和你一起找到我们的朋友？你真的以为我想把他们愚蠢的、不值得的、忘恩负义的灵魂从某种我还无法理解的洞里撬出来？你真的以为我想和你一起打破这个宇宙，只是为了拯救我们所爱的人？"

当她转向他时，他咧嘴一笑。她把手放在胸前，气喘吁吁，脸颊湿润，眼睛通红。

“You really think I’m unstoppable with you?”

“I do. You said it, after all, so it must be true.”

“Idiot,” she said. She was smiling. “I feel bad for you, so I’ll play along.”

“That’s what I hoping for. That’s the best an idiot like me can hope for, right?”

“Right. You’re lucky,” she said as he held her once more. “You’re lucky that you’re stuck with me.” She pushed away from him and started back towards the EVAs.

“Wait, Asuka—“

“Wait? Dummkopf, our friends have been waiting for twelve-thousand years.” She shot him a triumphant, imperious look over her shoulder. “I think we waited long enough. Let’s go.”

"你真的认为我对你势不可挡？"

"是的 ，毕竟是你说的，所以肯定是真的。"

"傻瓜，"她说。她在笑 "我为你感到难过，所以我会配合你。"

"这正是我所希望的。像我这样的白痴也只能希望这样了，对吧？"

"没错。你很幸运，"她说，他再次抱住了她。"你很幸运能和我在一起。" 她推开他，开始返回 EVA。

"等等，明日香—"

"等等？八嘎新机，我们的朋友已经等了一万两千年了。" 她向他投去一个胜利的、傲慢的眼神。"我想我们等得够久了。我们走吧。"

Author’s Note:

I want to keep this short, since these things are fundamentally pretty self-indulgent, but probably no more self-indulgent than a novel-length piece of Evangelion fanfiction which I ignored my dissertation and course planning to write, frantically, over the course of two weeks. If you’re not tired of my self-indulgence, read on—otherwise, I’d forgive you for clicking away.

我想长话短说，因为这些东西从根本上说是非常自我陶醉的，但可能不会比我不顾毕业论文和课程计划，用两周时间疯狂写出的长篇《福音战士》同人小说更自我陶醉。如果你不厌倦我的自我陶醉，请继续阅读--否则，我会原谅你点击离开。

The approximate inspiration for this story was my own affection for, and dissatisfaction with, other Eva continuations and stories out there. The doujinshi and epic fics are fine, but none of it ever felt exactly right to me. These were the characters, of course, but they didn’t sound exactly how the characters sound to me. That’s inevitable with any piece of media, though. Still haven’t watched the rebuilds, but the blu-rays came in the mail the other day.

这个故事的灵感大致来源于我对其他EVA续集和故事的喜爱和不满。同人小说和史诗小说都很好，但没有一个让我感觉完全正确。当然，这些都是角色，但在我看来，他们的声音和角色的声音并不完全一致。这在任何媒体中都是不可避免的。我还没看过ROE，不过前几天蓝光碟寄来了。

And, of course, the characters are so fun to write. Going into this, I wondered how someone could write a 300,000 word continuation over the course of ten years and—hey, now I know. I’m almost disappointed to have finished this. Asuka, of course, is the most fun to write (for me, at least; that should be obvious from the text you have before me). Any time I found myself stuck, I just handed off the action to her and she pushed it along.（-您的asuka太传神啦，太有dynamic了）

当然，书中的人物也非常有趣。写这本书的时候，我还在想，怎么会有人能用十年的时间写出一部 30 万字的续集，嘿嘿，现在我知道了。写完这本书，我几乎要失望了。当然，写明日香是最有趣的（至少对我来说是这样；这一点从我面前的文字中应该很明显）。每当我发现自己陷入困境时，我就把行动交给她，由她来推动。

The more proximate inspiration was a chunk of an interview someone had translated, with Asuka’s original voice actress. One of the possible interpretations of her words at the end of EoE, Anno had indicated to her, was that Asuka was experiencing morning sickness—that is, Shinji had actually raped her, instead of just masturbating. It was dark, and awful, but that’s Eva, I suppose. I took that idea and ran with it. Maybe I shouldn’t have, in this day and age, but I’m not attaching my real name to it and if you’re reading this, I’m guessing it can’t have upset you too much. Maybe I’m wrong, though.

更近一步的灵感来自于有人翻译的一段采访，采访对象是明日香的原配音演员。庵野曾向她表示，对明日香在《EoE》结尾所说的话的一种可能解释是，明日香正在经历孕吐--也就是说，真嗣真的强奸了她，而不仅仅是自慰。这很黑暗，也很可怕，但我想这就是EVA吧。我把这个想法付诸实践。在这个时代，也许我不该这么做，但我没有把我的真名附在上面，如果你正在读这篇文章，我想你应该不会太难过。不过，也许我错了。

I debated other titles for this story and other ways to end it. Mostly, I found myself re-listening to the old Queen song, “Teo Torriatte (Let us cling together)” over and over again, but I’ve never liked when Western music makes too much of an appearance in anime fanfiction. It’s one thing if it’s attested in the source material—“Fly Me to the Moon,” for instance—but I remember, when I was kid, reading so many stories where Shinji listened to Linkin Park and Blink-182. Instead, I let Rei quote the song in a round-about way, and gave the title to Ritsuko, who gets a lot of grief in this story. Now that I’m older, I actually love her as a character and find her super relatable—I’d totally ship her and Maya, but Kensuke felt like a cute (twisted) stop-gap that also calls back to her own affair with Gendo—though probably nothing could be as toxic as that.

我曾为这个故事的其他标题和其他结尾方式争论不休。最主要的是，我发现自己一遍又一遍地重听皇后乐队的老歌《Teo Torriatte（让我们紧紧相依）》，但我一直不喜欢西方音乐在动漫同人小说中出现得太多。如果是原著中的音乐--比如 "飞向月球"，那是一回事，但我记得小时候读过很多真嗣听林肯公园（Linkin Park）和眨眼182（Blink-182）的故事。我没有这样做，而是让丽以迂回的方式引用了这首歌，并把歌名给了律子，她在这个故事中受到了很大的伤害。现在我长大了，我其实很喜欢她这个角色，而且觉得她超有亲和力--我完全愿意把她和玛雅放在一起，但剑介感觉就像一个可爱（扭曲）的替代品，这也让我想起了她自己和源渡的婚外情，虽然可能没有什么比那更有毒了。

Originally, I had intended to end things with the karaoke scene and leave it ambiguous. The bittersweet uncertainty felt pretty Evangelion to me, and seemed fitting for a story that is, at times, an episode of The Good Place cast with EVA characters—I had even considered making Asuka way more conversant in continental philosophy, but that felt a little too much like wish fulfillment. In the end, I like leaving Asuka and Shinji in an unambiguously hopeless place, but with their hearts somewhat healed and, specifically, in a kind of parallel of the other great Anno robot show, Gunbuster.

最初，我打算以卡拉 OK 那场戏作为结尾，让故事模棱两可。对我来说，这种苦乐参半的不确定性让人感觉很像 "福音战士"，而且似乎也很适合这个故事，因为它有时就像一集由 EVA 角色演绎的 "杀必死"（The Good Place）。最后，我喜欢让明日香和真嗣处于一个毫无希望的境地，但他们的心灵却得到了某种程度的治愈，特别是与另一部伟大的庵野机器人剧《飞跃巅峰》形成了某种平行。

Did I mention that I’m inordinately proud of finding a way to open the story with a “cruel angel’s thesis” (that is, the dialogue between Rei and Asuka) and end it with “Fly Me to the Moon”?

我有没有说过，我为能找到一种方法，以 "残酷天使的行动纲领"（即丽和明日香之间的对话）作为故事的开头，并以 "飞向月球 "作为故事的结尾而感到无比自豪？

There’s more I could say: I’ve loved Evangelion for almost twenty years at this point, and this is the first piece of fanfiction I’ve written in fifteen years, and it’s helped me think about how I write in all sorts of ways and, oh hey, it’s longer than my dissertation is and how do I explain to my advisor that I don’t have a new chapter but I do have 40,000 plus words of metaphysical anime angst? I’ll leave it at that.

我还可以说更多： 我喜欢《新世纪福音战士》已经快二十年了，这是我十五年来写的第一部同人小说，它帮助我思考了如何以各种方式写作，哦，嘿，它比我的论文还长，我该如何向我的导师解释，我没有新的章节，但我有四万多字形而上学的动漫焦虑？我就不多说了。

Thank you for reading!
