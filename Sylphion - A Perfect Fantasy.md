I glance at her again as she strips off her swimsuit, marveling at how she moves, the graceful curves of her body, the soft, ghost-like tone of her skin… it fascinates me.  
我又一次瞥向她，她正脱下泳衣，她那优雅的动作、身体的柔美曲线、肌肤那柔和如幽灵般的色调……这一切都让我着迷。

**She** fascinates me. 她让我着迷。

With a massive effort I tear my gaze away; she can't catch me staring. At least, not while she's undressing. That would raise questions in anyone, even Ayanami Rei.  
我费了很大劲才移开视线；她不能发现我在盯着她。至少，不能在她脱衣服的时候。那样任何人都会产生疑问，哪怕是绫波零。

And I know I couldn't lie to her if she asked me. Not about this.  
我知道，如果她问我，我无法对她撒谎。尤其是这件事。

Who would have thought that I, the queen of school, Soryu Asuka Langley, would have a crush on Ayanami Rei, the class outcast?  
谁能想到，我，学校的女王，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，竟然会暗恋班上的异类，绫波零？

I wonder… if I told her I wanted her, wanted to love her, what would she say?  
我在想……如果我告诉她我想要她，想要爱她，她会怎么回答？

Would she hate me for it? Or, as with everything else, remain indifferent? Or… could she return these feelings?  
她会因此恨我吗？还是像对待其他一切那样，保持冷漠？或者……她能回应这些情感吗？

I shove these thoughts aside like so many times before, lest they consume me.  
我像以往无数次那样将这些念头推开，以免它们吞噬我。

I quickly slip out of my own suit, hang it up, and grab my clothes from my locker. I dump them on the bench unceremoniously, desperate to escape yet longing to go to her…  
我迅速脱下自己的西装，挂好，从储物柜里抓起衣服。我急切地将它们随意扔在长椅上，渴望逃离却又渴望去找她……

I think I'm going insane.  
我觉得自己快要疯了。

Then again, I suspect it was only a matter of time, anyway, and I'd rather be going insane over the object of my obsession rather than something else; she's worth insanity.  
再想想，我怀疑这只是时间问题，无论如何，我宁愿为我的痴迷对象而疯狂，而不是其他什么；她值得我为之疯狂。

I steal another glance at her and stop dead: she's looking back. It's a passing thing, merely a look of confirmation, to prove that I am indeed still here. Nothing more.  
我又偷瞄了她一眼，突然僵住：她也在看我。这只是一瞬间的事，仅仅是一个确认的眼神，证明我确实还在这里。仅此而已。

I feel my heart pound against my ribcage anyway.  
我依然感觉到心脏在胸腔里猛烈跳动。

Then she turns back around, reaches for her clothes and begins to get dressed.  
然后她转过身来，伸手去拿衣服，开始穿起来。

I'm left staring at her, my heart racing at about a million miles an hour. As I watch her clothe that incredibly lithe body, the beginnings of an idea take root. It's a stupid, reckless, suicidal thing to do, but with each passing moment I find it more and more tempting…  
我呆呆地看着她，心跳如百万英里时速般狂奔。当看着她穿上那无比柔韧的身体时，一个念头开始萌芽。这想法愚蠢、鲁莽、自寻死路，但随着每一刻流逝，我越发觉得它诱人……

God, she's so beautiful… so desirable… I want her…  
天啊，她太美了……如此迷人……我想要她……

No. I **need** her. 不，我需要她。

Before I make the conscious step from fantasizing about it to actually following though with this fantasy, I'm behind her, my arms around her waist.  
在我从幻想走向实际行动之前，我已经站在她身后，双臂环抱着她的腰。

She pauses with her shirt buttoned halfway, but otherwise doesn't seem surprised. I pull her close, my breasts pressing into the smooth cotton of her shirt, her slender body wielding and conforming so easily to my own... I know I'm about ready to loose all control, if I haven't already. I bring my lips to her ear, so close I know my breath must be tickling her. I whisper, softly, so quietly I can't be sure I've even spoken aloud.  
她衬衫扣到一半时停了下来，但除此之外似乎并不惊讶。我紧紧抱住她，我的胸部紧贴着她衬衫的光滑棉质面料，她纤细的身体如此轻易地适应并贴合着我的...我知道我快要失去所有控制了，如果我还没有的话。我将嘴唇贴近她的耳朵，近到我知道我的呼吸一定在轻拂她的耳廓。我轻声细语，如此低沉以至于我无法确定自己是否真的发出了声音。

"I want you." “我想要你。”

Slowly, she turns around, bringing us face to face. Her lips part ever so slightly as she whispers my name.  
她缓缓转身，让我们面对面。她的嘴唇微微张开，轻声呼唤我的名字。

"Asuka… I…" "明日香… 我…"

It's too much; I can't stand it. She's so close, in my arms… I want so badly to show her how much I need her.  
这太强烈了；我承受不住。她就在我怀里…我多么渴望向她展示我有多么需要她。

Before she can say anymore, I lean forward and capture her lips with mine. I feel as much as hear her inhale sharply; if she wasn't surprised before, she is now.  
在她能再说什么之前，我向前倾身，用我的唇捕捉住她的。我能感觉到她倒吸了一口气；如果她之前还没被惊到，那现在肯定是了。

For a moment I'm as surprised as Rei, but for another reason entirely: I never would have guessed her lips were so soft…  
有那么一刻，我和丽一样惊讶，但原因完全不同：我从未料到她的唇竟如此柔软……

I want more, to be closer to her…  
我渴望更多，想要更靠近她……

I struggle to control the passion I feel for her, like a rising heat that threatens to wash away everything. Gently, I press against her, backing her into the lockers, deepening our kiss awkwardly. Only now do I remember; I've never kissed anyone before… am I doing this right?  
我努力控制着对她的激情，那股不断升腾的热浪仿佛要将一切冲刷殆尽。我轻轻地压向她，将她逼至储物柜前，笨拙地加深了这个吻。直到此刻我才想起；我从未吻过任何人……我这样做对吗？

She moans softly, her arms sliding up my back to rest between my shoulder blades.  
她轻声呻吟，双臂滑上我的背部，停留在肩胛骨之间。

I feel her slid her tongue along my lips and I feel my eyes go wide in surprise; does she want this as much as I do…?  
我感觉她沿着我的唇线舔舐，我惊讶地瞪大了眼睛；她是否也像我一样渴望着这一切…？

This thought is lost as I part my lips and Rei's tongue ventures into my mouth… roaming… exploring… oh God…  
这个念头随着我分开双唇而消散，丽的双舌探入我口中……游走……探索……哦，天哪……

I shudder as I press harder against her, crushing her smaller frame against mine, practically smashing her against me, but it's still not enough... I feel like I'm going to explode; I need her closer…  
我颤抖着更用力地紧贴着她，将她娇小的身躯紧紧压在我的身上，几乎要将她碾碎般地拥入怀中，但即便如此，仍觉不够...我感到自己快要爆炸了；我需要她更近一些…

My hands roam her body, exploring, eliciting sharp inhales and soft moans. I trail kisses from her lips, across her cheek, down her neck, her breathing fast and heavy.  
我的双手在她身上游走，探索着，引得她急促吸气和轻柔呻吟。我吻从她的唇边，掠过脸颊，沿着脖颈而下，她的呼吸急促而沉重。

She pulls away for a moment, breathless.  
她短暂地抽离，气喘吁吁。

"Asuka… I… I love you." She gasps out.  
"明日香……我……我爱你。" 她喘息着说。

I stop, frozen, as my heart skips a beat. I'm left speechless.  
我停下脚步，僵立当场，心跳漏了一拍。我无言以对。

No one has ever said that to me.  
从未有人对我说过这样的话。

Is this what this is, this… feeling I have for her?  
这就是我对她的感觉吗？这种……我心中的情感？

Do I really love her?  
我真爱上她了吗？

Maybe. 或许吧。

Words seem so inadequate to express what I feel for her; even 'love' hardly begins to cover it.  
言语似乎不足以表达我对她的感情；即使是‘爱’这个词也远远不够。

I lift my head up from where I've buried myself in her collarbone, and stare into her eyes… those crimson pools that sends shivers down my spine when they alight on me...  
我从埋首于她锁骨间的姿势抬起头，凝视着她的眼睛……那双如深红池水般的眼眸，每当注视我时，总让我脊背发凉……

I cup her cheek gently, leaning close so that we're only inches apart.  
我轻轻托起她的脸颊，倾身靠近，我们之间仅隔几寸。

Vainly, I struggle to find words to convey my feelings for her.  
我徒劳地挣扎着，试图找到能表达我对她感情的词汇。

Eventually, I give up with words and passionately kiss her instead. Her hands slid up my back, and grip the back of my head.  
最终，我放弃了言语，转而热情地吻她。她的手滑上我的背，紧抓着我的后脑勺。

I think I've gotten my meaning across.  
我想我已经传达了我的意思。

Fin. 完。
