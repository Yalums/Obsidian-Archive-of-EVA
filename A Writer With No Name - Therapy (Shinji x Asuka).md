### Chapter 1 First Contact

EG: I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion that belongs to Gainax, TV Tokyo and Nihon Ad Systems all I own are any OC's I make myself  
EG: 我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，它属于 GAINAX、TV 东京和日本广告系统公司，我所拥有的只是我自己创作的任何原创角色。

Chapter 1: First Contact (Updated)  
第一章：初次接触（更新）

I watch their final moments, unable to do anything to help them. The sea has turned red, the Evangelions are in a state of rigor mortis, Lilith's remains are all over the place. A massive face that has been cut in half watches the last two humans in existence that are still alive.  
我目睹了他们的最后时刻，却无能为力。大海已染成红色，福音战士们僵硬如尸，莉莉丝的残骸遍布各处。一张被劈成两半的巨大面孔注视着仅存的两个尚存人世的人类。

As they lie on the beach, the boy named Shinji looks to his side. I don't know what he sees, but it's not there for me to see physically. So I entered his vision and now I see his old friend Rei standing on the water, watching him with a distant look, before she disappears. So now all that's left are those two, lying on a beach looking up at the stars and moon...the moon which now has the blood of Lilith spread upon it.  
他们躺在沙滩上，名叫真嗣的男孩侧头望去。我不知道他看到了什么，但那并非我肉眼所能见。于是我进入了他的视野，现在我看到他的老朋友绫波零站在水面上，用一种遥远的目光注视着他，随后消失不见。如今只剩下他们两人，躺在沙滩上仰望星空与月亮……那月亮如今沾满了莉莉丝的鲜血。

What a shame...it was much prettier when it was a simple white orb. Now whenever I look up, I'll see that red line covering part of it, or at least some PART of it.  
真是遗憾……它原本只是一个简单的白色球体时，要美丽得多。如今每当我抬头，总会看到那条红线覆盖其上的一部分，或者至少是其中的一部分。

Shinji now moves, causing me to leave his vision as he crawls over to the girl named Asuka. She is just as confused as he, especially when Shinji gets on top of her. He takes his hands, places them across her neck and he then begins to squeeze.  
真嗣现在动了，我随之离开他的视线，他爬向那个名叫明日香的女孩。她和他一样困惑，尤其是当真嗣压在她身上时。他伸出双手，放在她的脖子上，然后开始用力挤压。

The terror that enters Asuka's eyes chills me to my core, Shinji's look of anger and hate makes me want to puke.  
明日香眼中流露出的恐惧让我心寒，真嗣那充满愤怒和仇恨的表情让我想吐。

This boy was once a shy, cowardly teenager who was unfortunate enough to end up in this situation he was currently in. Now he was a misogynistic cockhole who was blinded by his own rage.  
这个男孩曾经是个害羞、懦弱的少年，不幸地陷入当前的境地。如今他却成了一个被自己的愤怒蒙蔽双眼、厌恶女性的混蛋。

I can't do anything….but she's going to die if I don't DO something now!  
我什么都做不了……但如果我现在不采取行动，她就会死！

That's when she gently caresses his face. The rage in Shinji's eyes disappears instantly, as he feels her warm welcoming touch. He stops squeezing as he realizes what he's doing. He's terrified, shaking and he hates himself to the point where he wants to die. Though he doesn't move, not even to give Asuka space, he just...hovers over her then he starts to cry.  
就在这时，她温柔地抚摸着他的脸颊。真嗣眼中的怒火瞬间消失，他感受到了她温暖而亲切的触碰。他停止了挤压，意识到自己在做什么。他害怕得发抖，痛恨自己到了想死的地步。尽管他没有移动，甚至没有给明日香留出空间，他就那样……悬在她上方，然后开始哭泣。

While this is happening Asuka looks up into with her one good eye, looks over to Shinji and says one word, "Disgusting."  
与此同时，明日香用她那只好眼睛向上看去，转向真嗣，只说了一个词：“恶心。”

I'm then freed from my prison...the story is technically over. They are destined to repeat the same events, but I can not allow that! Not after everything they have just been through, they deserve a peaceful world, and I can give them that!  
我终于从牢笼中解脱...故事在技术上已经结束。他们注定要重复同样的事件，但我不能允许那样！经历了这一切，他们理应得到一个和平的世界，而我可以给予他们！

Although...if they go into that world straight away, they'll reject it and the world will fall into chaos. I can't believe I have to do this, but there is no other choice. I materialize onto the beach in pieces from bottom to top, first my shoes, then my pants then my shirt with a jacket and tie.  
尽管...如果他们直接进入那个世界，他们会拒绝它，世界将陷入混乱。我真不敢相信我必须这么做，但别无选择。我以从下到上的方式在海滩上实体化，先是鞋子，然后是裤子，接着是衬衫，外加一件夹克和领带。

I notice that they haven't seen me yet, so I materialize a clipboard with some paper on it along with a pen. Then I wonder towards them, my shoes slightly sinking into the sand as I walk, causing the sand to get into both of them. It would annoy me if I had feet, though I could manifest myself as a human if I decided it was necessary. For now, all I need to do is talk to them. As an afterthought I materialize some gloves so they can see my hands, though that still won't take away their shock when they see me. However it's only when I end up standing right next to them, that they both see my shoes. They look up and see me, an 'invisible creature' wearing human clothing with a clipboard and pen, on a desolate beach in a ruined world.  
我发现他们还没注意到我，于是我具现出一个夹着纸的文件夹和一支笔。然后我向他们走去，鞋子微微陷入沙中，沙粒随之钻进鞋里。如果我有脚的话，这肯定会让我感到烦躁，不过如果需要，我可以决定以人类形态出现。眼下，我只需要和他们交谈。作为事后考虑，我具现出一些手套让他们能看到我的手，尽管这仍无法消除他们见到我时的震惊。然而，直到我站到他们身边，他们才注意到我的鞋子。他们抬头看到我，一个穿着人类服装、拿着文件夹和笔的‘隐形生物’，站在一个荒废世界的荒凉海滩上。

But what happens next surprises me, they DON'T scream. They just...stare, BOTH with looks of pure confusion and terror. I make a note of it. When I look back, they're still giving me that same look.  
但接下来发生的事情让我感到意外，他们并没有尖叫。他们只是……凝视，两人脸上都带着纯粹的困惑和恐惧。我记下了这一点。当我再次看向他们时，他们仍然用同样的眼神看着我。

I look at Shinji, his tear stained eyes and broken demeanour make it clear this is the 'main package about to unwrap' as it were. While Asuka on the other hand...is stone faced and terrified down to the core. She'll be easier to deal with, but if the two ARE to end up together...THAT would take a miracle. I'm going to have to decide on what or not what should NOT be performed here. In the meantime, I HATE the look of that eye patch as well as her bandages. It would be good to have as a reminder in the future, however she WON'T be needing them where she's going.  
我看着真嗣，他泪痕斑斑的双眼和破碎的神态清楚表明，这即将是所谓的‘主要包裹即将打开’。而另一方面，明日香则面无表情，内心深处充满了恐惧。她会更容易处理，但如果他们俩真的要走到一起……那将需要一个奇迹。我必须决定哪些是不应该在这里进行的。与此同时，我讨厌那只眼罩和她的绷带。尽管如此，它们将来可以作为一个提醒，但她去的地方不需要这些东西。

I crouch down to reach for the eye patch, but I'm stopped by a hand. I look to my right, Shinji is grabbing my arm with such force and determination he might nearly break it if I were human.  
我蹲下身去拿眼罩，但被一只手拦住了。我向右看去，真嗣紧紧抓住我的手臂，力度之大，决心之坚，如果我是人类的话，他几乎能将我的手臂折断。

"Don't touch her!" he says giving me a look of pure anger and rage. His teeth were clenched and his face was stiff as a statue.  
“别碰她！”他怒吼道，眼中充满了纯粹的愤怒和狂暴。他的牙齿紧咬，脸庞僵硬如雕像。

I then hear heavy breathing, it's Asuka breathing faster and heavier due to my presence. She's scared, her eyes and face make her look as if she has pissed herself.  
随后我听到了沉重的呼吸声，是明日香，她因为我的出现而呼吸急促且沉重。她很害怕，眼神和表情让她看起来像是吓得尿了裤子。

I turn my arm through Shinji's grip like it's nothing. This surprises him as he goes back to his look of pure confusion. I then open and raise my hand, breaking out of Shinji's grip. As I do so Asuka's eye patch comes off revealing her new eye. The bandages then come off showing her arm in the best shape it has ever been in. THIS stuns them both.  
我轻松地转动胳膊，从真嗣的紧握中挣脱出来。这让他惊讶地回到了一脸茫然的状态。接着我张开并举起手，彻底摆脱了真嗣的握持。就在这时，明日香的眼罩脱落，露出了她新换的眼睛。随后绷带也解开，展现出她手臂前所未有的最佳状态。这一幕让他们两人都惊呆了。

As I stand back up to take notes, Asuka leans up almost bumping into Shinji. To look upon Asuka's new arm along with her new eye as well, she and Shinji are both slack jawed in awe. Now I could just leave them like this, to make sure they remember all of this before the repeat happens. But no...I'll be generous, I'll help these two rebuild their world.  
当我重新站起来准备做笔记时，明日香几乎要撞到真嗣。看到明日香的新手臂和新眼睛，她和真嗣都目瞪口呆，惊叹不已。现在我可以就这样离开，确保他们在重复发生之前记住这一切。但不行...我会慷慨一些，帮助这两个人重建他们的世界。

### Chapter 2: Hypothesis (Updated)  
第二章：假设（更新版）

I raised my right hand, and with the other took off my glove. Revealing yet again that I was invisible, though their reactions were different now. The two looked at me with curiosity and awe, makes sense after giving them a small taste of my power.  
我举起右手，另一只手摘下手套。再次揭示了我隐形的事实，尽管他们的反应现在不同了。两人带着好奇和敬畏看着我，给他们尝了一点我的力量后，这很合理。

Now came the decision, have the conversation here or take them to my dimension. Looking up at the stars while thinking about it, I was reminded of my surroundings. The massive blood streaks across the moon, the red ocean and the body parts of the once powerful Lilith. Viewing these disturbing sights, I heard something that made me decide right there and then.  
现在到了做决定的时候，是在这里谈话还是带他们去我的维度。抬头望着星星思考着，我被周围的景象提醒了。月亮上巨大的血迹，红色的海洋和曾经强大的莉莉丝的残肢。看到这些令人不安的景象，我听到了一些声音，让我当场做出了决定。

"It has a head. Because it's body moves to look around." the young girl said.  
“它有头。因为它的身体会动来观察四周。”小女孩说。

Viewing them one last time, I snapped by using my thumb and ring finger. For some reason I can not properly snap. Thankfully the two didn't see it, I hate this disability as it proves something to me that I could never fully face. But enough about me, once I snapped my fingers the world turned white.  
最后一次凝视他们，我用拇指和无名指尝试打响指。不知为何，我总是打不响。幸好那两人没看见，我讨厌这个缺陷，因为它向我证明了一些我永远无法完全面对的事情。但先不说我了，当我打响指后，世界变成了一片白色。

I was used to this procedure, though I did not fully prepare my two patients for the experience. For it was a little jarring, both of them screamed for the longest period of time. When my home came into view, the two had seemed to have forgotten their disdain for each other. As they were clutching each other tightly, I took a note of that.  
我对这个过程已经习以为常，尽管我没有完全为我的两位病人准备好这种体验。因为它确实有点令人震惊，他们俩尖叫了很长时间。当我的家出现在视野中时，两人似乎已经忘记了彼此间的厌恶。他们紧紧相拥，我注意到了这一点。

While the two remained clutching each other, eyes closed, Shinji crying on Asuka's shoulder and vice versa.  
两人依旧紧抱着对方，眼睛紧闭，真嗣在明日香的肩上哭泣，而明日香也在真嗣的肩上哭泣。

I set up my office, I materialized two therapy couches as well as a desk for me with a chair for me to sit in. Waiting for the two of them to calm down, I waited in my chair taking notes and drawing a cute image of them embracing themselves. After a while, both of them opened their eyes to see the endless white void.  
我布置好了办公室，实体化了两张治疗沙发以及一张带椅子的桌子供我使用。等待他们俩平静下来，我坐在椅子上做笔记，并画了一幅他们相拥的可爱图像。过了一会儿，两人睁开眼睛，看到了无尽的白色虚空。

Surprisingly they didn't lose contact with each other as they stood up. Clutching an arm or a hand as they looked around, they didn't see my office until I started to play some music.  
出乎意料的是，他们站起来时并没有松开彼此。他们紧握着对方的手臂或手，环顾四周，直到我开始播放音乐，他们才注意到我的办公室。

I materialized a radio with a CD player and popped in a track. One of my favorites, _Belle and Sebestain's Dress Up In You_. They turned around to see me tapping on my desk to the beat of the music, they looked as shocked and confused as before. Yet they still held each others hand, I signaled for them to come over as I took a note.  
我实体化了一台带 CD 播放器的收音机，放入了一张唱片。是我最喜欢的，Belle 和 Sebestain 的《Dress Up In You》。他们转过身来，看到我随着音乐节奏敲打桌面，表情依旧震惊和困惑。然而他们仍然紧握着对方的手，我示意他们过来，同时做了个笔记。

They didn't even budge, frozen in place. I noticed this and stared at them, still signalling for them to come over. Oops, I forgot to put my gloves on. Haha. I materialized my gloves and gave the signal again. They slowly walked over to where I placed everything, and I pointed to both of the couches.  
他们甚至没有动弹，僵在原地。我注意到这一点，盯着他们，仍然示意他们过来。哎呀，我忘了戴手套。哈哈。我变出了手套，再次发出信号。他们慢慢地走到我放置一切的地方，我指向两张沙发。

Signalling one for each of them. They let go of each others hand, right then the questions started to poor out.  
示意他们各坐一张。他们松开了彼此的手，就在那时，问题如潮水般涌出。

"What are you!? Who are you!? What is this place!?" Shinji shouted at me.  
“你是什么人？！你是谁？！这是什么地方！？” 真嗣对我大喊。

Only to be followed up by Asuka shouting just as much.  
紧接着是明日香同样大声的喊叫。

"What happened to earth!? Are we even alive!? WHAT IS GOING ON!?" Asuka shouted as she broke down into tears.  
“地球怎么了？！我们是不是还活着？！到底发生了什么！？”明日香哭喊着崩溃了。

Collapsing down on the floor, crying her eyes out. To my surprise, Shinji didn't do anything, he just stared at Asuka and then back at me. He repeated this until he shouted again.  
她瘫坐在地上，泪流满面。令我惊讶的是，真嗣什么也没做，只是盯着明日香，然后又看向我。他重复着这个动作，直到再次大喊起来。

"Well, WHAT IS GOING ON!?"  
"到底发生了什么事！？"

I took a note, which only served to piss off Shinji even more. He grabbed the clipboard out of my hand and threw it across the room. Once it hit the floor, Shinji pounded his hands on my desk. He looked straight at where my head usually would be and made a face of pure hatred.  
我记下了一笔，这只会让真嗣更加恼火。他夺过我手中的写字板，扔到了房间的另一边。一落地，真嗣就猛拍我的桌子。他直视着我通常头所在的位置，露出了纯粹的憎恨表情。

"What is going on!?" he said through his teeth.  
""到底怎么回事！？"" 他咬牙切齿地说。

I raised my hand, teleported the clipboard right into my hand and smacked him in the face with it. I kind of chuckled a little bit, but it didn't mean anything as he couldn't see me. Right as he turned back to me, I pointed to Asuka who was looking up at Shinji.  
我举起手，瞬间将文件夹传送到手中，并用力拍在他的脸上。我忍不住轻笑了一声，但这并无意义，因为他看不见我。就在他转回身面对我时，我指向了抬头望着真嗣的明日香。

Shinji looked at her to see that she had a look of terror on her face. The same one she gave when she was being choked. This froze Shinji in his place, now his face looked horrified, then saddened. He then began to break down and cry, getting down on his knees and getting close to Asuka.  
真嗣看着她，发现她脸上满是恐惧的表情。那正是她被掐住时露出的表情。这使得真嗣僵在原地，他的脸上先是惊恐，随后转为悲伤。接着，他开始崩溃哭泣，跪倒在地，靠近明日香。

Who started to back away from him, a hint of disgust now in her look. The young girl backed right into her couch. Shinji at this point was making the position that someone would usually make to beg.  
明日香开始后退，脸上露出一丝厌恶。少女退到了沙发边。此时，真嗣摆出了通常人们乞求时的姿势。

"I'm sorry Asuka, I never wanted to harm you." he said as clearly as he could.  
"对不起，明日香，我从没想过要伤害你。" 他尽可能清晰地说道。

As the tears and hint of sadness nearly obscured his voice.  
泪水和悲伤的痕迹几乎掩盖了他的声音。

Asuka respond with "How dare you say that you fucking hypocrit. What are these then?"  
明日香回应道："你这个该死的伪君子，怎么敢这么说？这些又是什么？"

She pointed to the bruise marks on her neck. Shinji saw them and made more tears repeat the words "I'm sorry." over and over again.  
她指着脖子上的淤青痕迹。真嗣看到了，泪水再次涌出，一遍遍重复着“对不起”。

She soon started to follow suit, both crying and clearly broken from the events that had just unraveled. Shinji looked back at me to see my hand up in the air. He then looked back over to Asuka who was now feeling around her neck. I was removing the bruises, making them fade away.  
她很快也跟着哭了起来，显然是被刚刚发生的事情击垮了。真嗣回头看向我，我举起手。他随即又看向明日香，她正在摸索自己的脖子。我在消除那些淤青，让它们逐渐消失。

Asuka felt the pain slowly went away, she looked at me with the eyes of thankfulness. I turned to Shinji, he had the same look. They looked like pure innocents, I felt my soul ache. I have never felt this affection from two people. Though my patience had grown thin and I wanted to help them.  
明日香感到疼痛慢慢消退，她用充满感激的眼神看着我。我转向真嗣，他也是同样的表情。他们看起来就像纯真的孩子，我感到内心一阵刺痛。我从未从两个人那里感受到如此深厚的情感。尽管我的耐心已所剩无几，但我仍想帮助他们。

I raised my hands, slowly they were raised off the ground. They panicked for a moment, but that began to fade when they were set on the couches. They looked at each other, one more time with the look of confusion.  
我举起双手，慢慢地它们从地面升起。他们一时慌乱，但当被安置在沙发上时，那份慌乱开始消退。他们再次互望，带着困惑的神情。

Then they focused on me, I took my one more note and looked at them with my hands together. Elbows on the table, hands slightly covering where my mouth would be. I admit, I've seen this pose been done before.  
随后，他们的注意力集中在我身上，我再次记下笔记，双手合十，手肘撑在桌上，手掌微微遮住嘴部。我承认，我之前见过这种姿势。

They were now both on the edge of their seats as the music finally ended. There was a long period of silence as I looked between me and them…  
音乐终于结束，他们两人都坐在椅子边缘。长时间的沉默中，我来回看着我和他们之间……

"I'm sorry for the way I have treated you both so far."  
"我很抱歉一直以来对你们俩的态度。"

I said in a deep monotone voice. While forming a face befitting that of a human. I settled on younger man look, in his twenties, short hair, brown eyes. This surprised both of them, they were bewildered and I realized that if I were to mimic a human. I might as well fill in the rest, so I did.  
我用低沉的单调声音说道。同时塑造出一个适合人类的面部表情。我决定采用一个二十多岁的年轻男子形象，短发，棕色眼睛。这让他们俩都感到惊讶，他们困惑不解，我意识到如果我要模仿人类，我最好把其他部分也补全，于是我这么做了。

Fortunately my clothing were not regulated to physics, so they expanded as I formed. Once fully formed, I turned toward Asuka. She was not only bewildered, she was clearly now attracted to me. Interesting, I forgot about how different the need for love amongst humans is formed. I looked her in the eyes, that now were more focused than ever.  
幸运的是，我的服装不受物理规律限制，所以它们随着我的形态变化而扩展。完全成型后，我转向明日香。她不仅感到困惑，现在显然也被我吸引了。有趣，我忘记了人类对爱的需求是多么不同。我注视着她的眼睛，现在比以往任何时候都更加专注。

"What are your true feelings for Shinji?" I asked.  
"你对真嗣的真实感情是什么？" 我问道。

### Chapter 3: Gathering Data  
第三章：收集数据

She was taken aback by my question, I could see that the curious look she once had was now replaced with embarrassment. However, right before her face could turn red, she looked back to Shinji. That terror/disgusted filled look returned to her again, she turned back to me with fire in her eyes.  
她被我的问题吓了一跳，我看得出她曾经的好奇表情现在被尴尬所取代。然而，就在她的脸颊即将变红之前，她转头看向了真嗣。那种充满恐惧和厌恶的表情再次回到她的脸上，她转回来看着我，眼中燃烧着怒火。

"I hate him." she said.  
“我恨他。”她说。

"He is the reason for all of this happening."  
"这一切的发生都是因为他。"

I gazed over at Shinji, he was looking down on the ground in sorrow and embarrassment. In his mind she was right, he's been like this sense the beginning. Never really standing up for himself or fighting back. Granted Asuka wasn't completely wrong, the events leading up to this would definitely favor that point.  
我望向真嗣，他正悲伤而尴尬地低头看着地面。在他心里，她是对的，他从一开始就是这样，从未真正为自己挺身而出或反击。诚然，明日香并非完全错误，导致这一切的事件无疑会支持她的观点。

"Interesting." I said. "有意思。" 我说道。

I turn to Shinji, "Any thoughts."  
我转向真嗣，问道：“有什么想法吗？”

Shinji doesn't seem to notice me looking towards him, however, he does answer my question.  
真嗣似乎没注意到我在看他，不过他还是回答了我的问题。

"She's right...I doomed the world." he said in a monotone voice with a hint of sorrow.  
“她说得对……我毁灭了世界。”他用单调的声音说道，带着一丝悲伤。

Turning back to Asuka, she appeared to be even more pissed off. Her face was increasingly getting more angrier, before I could ask her my next question. She got up and shouted at the top of her lungs "STUPID SHINJI! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!?"  
转头看向明日香，她似乎更加恼火了。她的脸色越来越愤怒，我还没来得及问下一个问题。她站起来，用尽全力大喊：“笨蛋真嗣！你到底怎么回事！？”

Shinji nearly fell out of his seat when Asuka did this, a surprised look on him. She then wondered over, bent down and grabbed him by the collar. Holding him up close to her face, looking into his eyes with such intensity. It would intimidate anything, and Shinji was getting the full force of that.  
明日香这一举动让真嗣差点从座位上摔下来，他脸上露出惊讶的表情。她随后走过去，弯下腰抓住他的衣领。把他拉近自己的脸，用如此强烈的目光盯着他的眼睛。这足以震慑任何事物，而真嗣正承受着这一切。

"What is it?" she asked through her teeth.  
“怎么了？”她咬牙切齿地问。

"What made you this way, it couldn't just be your father? What made you such a coward?"  
"是什么让你变成这样的，总不能只是因为你父亲吧？是什么让你如此懦弱？"

"An attractive coward." I said before force pushing her onto him.  
"一个迷人的懦夫。" 我说完便用力将她推向他。

"Ah! Mmmmpphhh!" she screamed as she tripped.  
"啊！嗯嗯嗯！" 她摔倒时尖叫道。

"What-mmmmpphhhhh!" he said as she tripped  
"什-呣呣呣呣！" 他发出声音，因为她绊倒了

She was now laying on top of him. Unfortunately, as the sounds both of them made clear. They we're now kissing, and both felt the feelings I expected. Confusion, realization, satisfaction, and then awkwardness. That awkwardness is received when you keep your eyes open when you kiss someone, and both of them had their eyes open.  
她现在正躺在他身上。不幸的是，从他们发出的声音可以清楚地知道，他们现在正在接吻，而且双方都感受到了我所预料到的情感：困惑、领悟、满足，然后是尴尬。当你在接吻时保持眼睛睁开，就会感受到这种尴尬，而他们俩都睁着眼睛。

"Oops." I said while cracking a slight smile.  
"哎呀。" 我微微一笑说道。

Asuka shot up faster than a bullet, looking down on Shinji with a look of disgust and terror. Backing up and covering her face with her hands, Shinji springing up and realizing what just happened. Now, his face looked red and ashamed. Before he could even say anything, I took those words right out his mouth.  
明日香如离弦之箭般猛地坐起，带着厌恶和恐惧的神情俯视着真嗣。真嗣后退并用双手捂住脸，随即弹起身来，意识到刚刚发生了什么。此刻，他的脸涨得通红，满是羞愧。他还没来得及说些什么，我就抢先把那些话从他嘴里夺走了。

"I'm sorry Asuka." I said. Both of them looking over to me now. I simply smiled and looked at her with an honest smile of apology. However, that wasn't enough, she realized what I had done and was pissed off. Now she was the one wondering up to my desk and slamming her hands on it.  
“对不起，明日香。”我说道。他们俩都转头看向我。我简单地笑了笑，用真诚的歉意微笑看着她。然而，这还不够，她意识到我做了什么，怒火中烧。现在，她正朝我的桌子走来，双手重重地拍在上面。

"You asshole! What the fuck do you think your doing!?" she nearly shouted at me.  
“你这个混蛋！你他妈的到底在干什么？！”她几乎是对我吼道。

"I'm sorry, I like to toy with people sometime." I say while smiling and leaning back in my seat.  
"对不起，我有时候喜欢捉弄人。" 我笑着说，同时靠回椅背。

"This isn't funny! You made me kiss a man who would've killed me!" she said. A good point, but there's more to this.  
"这不好笑！你让我亲了一个差点杀了我的人！" 她生气地说。确实有道理，但事情没这么简单。

"True, he is a misogynistic, unstable, mental case." I gazed over to him while saying this. He was looking over at us with a curious look, but looked down in embarrassment. "But I have no doubt that you still love him."  
"没错，他是个厌恶女性、情绪不稳的精神病。" 我边说边瞥向他。他好奇地看着我们，随即尴尬地低下头。"但我敢肯定，你依然爱着他。"

A silence fell over the room, Asuka's gaze was that of embarrassment and fear. Meanwhile, Shinji was looking half way up in disbelief. I had both of their attention, so I decided to ask my next question.  
房间里陷入了一片寂静，明日香的眼神中流露出尴尬与恐惧。与此同时，真嗣半信半疑地望着上方。我吸引了他们两人的注意，于是决定提出下一个问题。

"What is your definition of love?"  
“你如何定义爱？”

This one took her a while, before she looked back over to Shinji then back to me.  
这个问题让她沉思了一会儿，她先是看向真嗣，然后又转向我。

"I'm not going to answer that, there's no point."  
"我不会回答那个问题的，没有意义。"

I was surprised, but I didn't show it. I did however, take a note about what she did. After that, I asked the same question again.  
我感到惊讶，但没有表现出来。不过，我确实记下了她的行为。之后，我又问了同样的问题。

"What is your definition of love?"  
“你如何定义爱？”

She had that same annoyed look and this time she didn't hold back. Grabbing my clipboard and throwing it my face. For the first time in while, I felt pain. Though again, I didn't show what I actually felt in that moment. That would give them power over me and that would only lead to things getting more complicated.  
她还是那副恼怒的表情，这次她没有克制。一把夺过我的写字板，朝我脸上扔来。许久未曾感受到的疼痛袭来，尽管如此，我并未流露出那一刻的真实感受。那只会让他们在我之上获得力量，而这只会让事情变得更加复杂。

"What's your obsession with love!? Are you some sorta of pervert?!"  
“你为什么对爱情如此痴迷？！你是不是有什么变态倾向？！”

"No." I responded. I materialized a dictionary in my hand, catching her a little bit of guard. I flipped through it until I came to the page I wanted. "Love, Noun, 1. An intense feeling of deep affection. 2. A great interest in pleasure in something. 3. A person or thing that one loves." I make it disappear, than address my attention back to a confused looking Asuka.  
“不是。”我回答道。我手中凭空变出一本字典，让她稍稍有些措手不及。我翻阅着，直到找到我想要的那一页。“爱，名词，1. 一种强烈的深厚情感。2. 对某事物极大的兴趣或愉悦。3. 所爱之人或物。”我将字典消失，然后重新将注意力转向一脸困惑的明日香。

"There are other definitions, but there is one thing that makes this one word very prominent to this discussion. Can you guess what that is?"  
"还有其他定义，但有一个因素使得这个词在这场讨论中显得尤为突出。你能猜到是什么吗？"

She stands there with the same confused look, I look of over to Shinji who is also giving me the same look. I focused back on Asuka and give her the honest truth.  
她站在那里，一脸困惑，我瞥向真嗣，他也同样困惑地看着我。我重新集中注意力在明日香身上，诚实地告诉她真相。

"Love caused the end of your world."  
"爱导致了你们世界的终结。"

The same silence fills the room, now with even more confused and fearful gazes focusing on me. It makes me feel guilty, but I'm not the one to blame. I'll show them the results of love, as I materialize a remote in my hand. A TV remote, I could simply snap my fingers and show them what I'm about to show them. Except my hands are visible, so avoiding them seeing that would be in my best interests.  
同样的寂静充斥着房间，现在更多混杂着困惑与恐惧的目光聚焦在我身上。这让我感到内疚，但我并非罪魁祸首。我将向他们展示爱的成果，因为我手中凭空出现了一个遥控器。一个电视遥控器，我本可以打个响指就让他们看到我想展示的东西。只是我的双手清晰可见，所以避免让他们看到这一点对我最有利。

I hit the on button and a massive screen appears behind me. Showing events spanning all across their history, except it's more focused on the events they we're apart of and this scares them. Their past's flash before them, Shinji being abandoned by his father, Asuka's mother hanging herself.  
我按下开机键，一个巨大的屏幕出现在我身后。展示着跨越他们整个历史的事件，尤其是那些他们亲身经历过的，这让他们感到恐惧。他们的过去在眼前闪现，真嗣被父亲抛弃，明日香的母亲上吊自杀。

Then more starts to appear on screen, Shinji's traumatic experiences from 3 to 14 years old. Asuka's training and repression of her fear, as well as everyone else. Everyone they knew past's is shown before them, Misasto's, Rei's, Gendo's, Ritsuko's, etc.  
接着屏幕上开始出现更多内容，真嗣从 3 岁到 14 岁经历的创伤。明日香的训练和她对恐惧的压抑，以及其他所有人。他们所认识的每个人的过去都展现在他们面前，美里、绫波、源堂、律子等等。

"Notice." I say as I stop it right before Misasto and Ryoji have sex. I reach my hand up and make it look like I grabbed the image. I shrink it down and place it on the table, the same goes for Rei's creation, the creation of the evanglions and finally the earth after the Third Impact.  
"注意。" 我边说边在 Misasto 和 Ryoji 即将发生关系前及时制止。我伸手一抓，仿佛真的抓住了那个画面。我将其缩小并放在桌上，Rei 的创造物、使徒们的创造以及第三次冲击后的地球也如法炮制。

"This was all done in the name of love."  
"这一切都是为了爱。"

### Chapter 4: Define Insanity  
第四章：定义疯狂

Shinji got up from his seat and wandered over to my desk, where he joined Asuka at looking at all the tiny screens. They stare at the screens with such intent, slack jawed and dumbstruck. However, their looks of curiosity have disappeared completely. Now, they are horrified, not only at the acts committed, not only at their newly revealed pasts. They just witnessed events that they never even saw, but knew were going on.  
真嗣从座位上起身，踱步到我的桌前，与明日香一起盯着那些小屏幕。他们目不转睛地盯着屏幕，下巴松弛，目瞪口呆。然而，他们那充满好奇的表情已完全消失。现在，他们感到恐惧，不仅是对所犯行为的恐惧，也不仅是对他们新揭露的过去的恐惧。他们刚刚目睹了那些从未亲眼见过，却知道正在发生的事件。

"You…..saw….everything?" Shinji barely got out.  
“你……看到了……一切？”真嗣勉强挤出这句话。

The look of absolute terror on both their faces almost looked permanent. So I snapped my fingers, they didn't see my disability, thank god. The screens disappeared and now their attention was on me. However, my gaze was only firmly laid on Asuka. She wanted to run, I could sense it. So I got my question out before she could turn around.  
他们脸上那绝对的恐惧表情几乎像是永久性的。于是我打了个响指，谢天谢地，他们没注意到我的残疾。屏幕消失了，现在他们的注意力都集中在我身上。然而，我的目光只坚定地落在明日香身上。她想逃跑，我能感觉到。所以在她转身之前，我先问出了我的问题。

"Did you see what happened to him?"  
“你看到他发生什么事了吗？”

This stopped her, but for about a second. As she looked at me, then at Shinji and grabbed his hand. She pulled him with her out onto the void, I watched their silhouettes slowly grow smaller and smaller. Until, they were so far away that my human eyes couldn't see them. This amused me, but the session must go on. Though right as I was about to snap my fingers and bring them back. I wanted to show them how far from home they really were.  
这让她停了下来，但只停了一秒钟。她看着我，然后看着真嗣，抓住了他的手。她拉着他走进虚空，我看着他们的身影慢慢变小，越来越小。直到，他们离得如此之远，以至于我的人类眼睛无法再看到他们。这让我觉得有趣，但实验必须继续。就在我准备打响指把他们带回来的时候。我想向他们展示他们离家乡有多远。

I materialized the CD version of Pink Floyd's The Wall and inserted the second disk. As _Hey You_ began to play, I also materialized a bass guitar. Too bad I never really learned how to play any instrument. I teleport straight to their location, hovering over them. The music followed with me as I played the bass section, they stopped whatever they were arguing about. Their hands left again as they looked up, again looking upon me with that horrified stare. I started to sing.  
我实体化了平克·弗洛伊德的《迷墙》CD 版，并插入了第二张碟。随着《嘿，你》开始播放，我还实体化了一把贝斯。可惜我从没真正学会过如何演奏任何乐器。我直接传送到他们所在的位置，悬浮在他们上方。音乐随着我一起，我弹奏着贝斯部分，他们停止了争吵。他们的手再次放下，抬头看向我，再次用那种惊恐的目光注视着我。我开始唱起来。

_"Hey you, out there in the cold. Getting lonely, getting old can you feel me?"  
“嘿，你，在那寒冷的外面。感到孤独，渐渐老去，你能感受到我吗？”_

I stared back at them as I slowly descended, the recording filling in the other parts of the music.  
我盯着他们，缓缓降落，录音填补了音乐的其他部分。

"_Hey you, standing in the aisle. With itchy feet and fading smiles can you feel me?"_  
"嘿，站在过道上的你。脚痒难耐，笑容渐淡，你能感受到我吗？"

When I touched the ground, Shinji grabbed Asuka and forced her to turn around. They began to run the other way. Though they weren't holding hands this time, though they were both running opposite of me. I teleport in front of them, this time Asuka screamed and fell down. I left the bass guitar playing with my hand, as I walked right through it with the rest of my body.  
当我触地时，真嗣抓住了明日香，强迫她转身。他们开始朝另一个方向跑去。虽然这次他们没有牵手，虽然他们都在远离我。我瞬移到他们面前，这次明日香尖叫着摔倒了。我让贝斯吉他继续演奏，而我的身体则直接穿过了它。

_"Hey you, don't let them bury the light."  
"嘿，你，别让他们埋没那束光。"_

The two were now to terrified to run, as I walked forward I kept my gaze upon Asuka. Sitting on the floor and barely pushing herself away, I was surprised to sense Shinji running up to attack me. I let the attack faze through me and he fell upon the ground. Still keeping my gaze upon Asuka, Shinji then got up and ran past me.  
两人现在害怕得无法逃跑，我向前走去，目光始终停留在明日香身上。她坐在地板上，几乎是在勉强自己往后挪动，我惊讶地感觉到真嗣冲上来攻击我。我让他的攻击穿透而过，他摔倒在地。我依然注视着明日香，真嗣随后站起身，从我身边跑过。

_"Don't give in without a fight."  
“不要不战而降。”_

Shinji was now guarding Asuka, a defensive stone cold look on his face. This only amused me.  
真嗣现在正守护着明日香，脸上带着冷酷的防御表情。这让我觉得很有趣。

_"Hey you, out there on your own sitting naked by the phone. Would you touch me?"  
"嘿，你，独自一人坐在电话旁赤裸着。你会触碰我吗？"_

The both of them started to float as I raised my arm like my hand was still there. They started to float again, though I levitated with them. Asuka grabbed on to Shinji and soon began to cry. Shinji held on to her, but kept his slightly panicked look on me.  
当我举起手臂，仿佛我的手还在那里时，他们俩开始漂浮起来。他们再次漂浮起来，尽管我和他们一起悬浮着。明日香抓住了真嗣，很快就开始哭泣。真嗣抱着她，但仍然带着些许惊慌的表情看着我。

_"Hey you, with your ear against the wall. Waiting for someone to call out would you touch me?"  
"嘿，你，耳朵贴着墙壁。等待着有人呼唤，你会触碰我吗？"_

I glided over to them, singing the verse and keeping an eye on the both of them. Shinji tried to swim away from me, but that doesn't exactly work in zero gravity. Asuka held on to him so tightly, it seemed his clothing was about to tear.  
我滑行到他们身边，唱着那段歌词，同时留意着他们两人。真嗣试图从我身边游走，但在零重力环境下这并不奏效。明日香紧紧抓着他，仿佛他的衣服随时都会被撕裂。

_"Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?"  
“嘿，你能帮我搬这块石头吗？”_

I got close enough to hover over them like I did before, but this time in reverse. This caught them off guard, now despite their terror. Their curiosity kicked in for a second as I floated upside down. Shinji and Asuka kept their eyes on me, as I reached out my arm and formed a hand of pure light.  
我足够靠近，像之前那样悬浮在他们上方，但这次是倒过来的。这让他们措手不及，尽管他们感到恐惧，但好奇心还是短暂地占据了上风。我倒悬着漂浮，真嗣和明日香紧盯着我，我伸出胳膊，形成了一只纯光的手。

"_Open your heart, I'm coming home."_  
"敞开心扉，我回来了。"

As the drum beat built, my hand passed through both their bodies. As the beat of the music played, I showed them…..everything. The First Impact, the Battle of the Angles, The Second Impact, the list continues on for as long as I saw fit. However, I stopped the visions when the music finally ended. I teleport them and dropped them each on their own couches. They were both still as boards now, wide eyed and horrified. I slowly floated down into my chair and picked up my clipboard again.  
随着鼓声渐强，我的手穿过了他们两人的身体。随着音乐的节拍，我向他们展示了……一切。第一次冲击，天使之战，第二次冲击，这一系列事件持续到我认为合适为止。然而，当音乐最终结束时，我停止了这些幻象。我将他们传送并分别放在各自的沙发上。他们现在都僵硬如木，瞪大眼睛，惊恐万分。我缓缓飘落到我的椅子上，再次拿起我的文件夹。

Turning again to Asuka, I asked her the question of the hour. "Tell me Asuka, what is your definition of Insanity?"  
再次转向明日香，我问了她这个时刻的问题。"告诉我，明日香，你对疯狂的定义是什么？"

She didn't say anything, she might have seen too much. Perhaps I had done something wrong, however, I don't make mistakes. I simply decided to speed up the recovery process by snapping her back to her senses.  
她什么也没说，或许她见得太多了。也许我做错了什么，然而，我不会犯错。我只是决定通过让她恢复理智来加快恢复过程。

I teleport right over her, hovered their, looked into her eyes and explained to her something important. I knew she was listening because she started to cry again.  
我瞬间传送到她身边，悬浮在那里，凝视着她的眼睛，向她解释了一些重要的事情。我知道她在听，因为她又开始哭了。

"Many people have different interpretations of Insanity, the most famous being doing the exact same thing over again expecting it to change. However, that's not the case for you darling, for you did something technically insane."  
许多人对疯狂有不同的解释，最著名的莫过于重复做同样的事情却期待结果改变。然而，亲爱的，对你来说并非如此，你做了一件在技术上堪称疯狂的事。

I materialized the dictionary again and flipped to insanity.  
我又一次实体化了那本词典，翻到了‘疯狂’那一页。

"Insanity: extreme foolishness or irrationality."  
“疯狂：极端的愚蠢或非理性。”

Chucking the book to the side, I focused on Asuka again. This time I grabbed her and picked her up. She didn't even put up a fight as I lifted her over to Shinji. Who had been watching us the entire time. Before I put her down, she broke free and fell on top of him. Crying and holding on for dear life, Shinji just gave me the same deadpan, stone cold look as always.  
我把书扔到一边，再次将注意力转向明日香。这次我抓住她，把她抱了起来。她甚至没有反抗，任由我抱着她走向真嗣。真嗣一直在旁边看着我们。在我把她放下之前，她挣脱了，跌落在真嗣身上。她哭着紧紧抱住他，而真嗣一如既往地给了我一个死气沉沉、冷若冰霜的眼神。

"This boy hurt you, he tormented you and forced you into becoming who you are. You should be running from this thing, yet here you are. Lying and crying on top of him in the skin tight suit of yours. You grabbed his hand as you ran away from me, you held onto him to ensure that he would not be harmed. You still care for him…...you love him."  
"这个男孩伤害了你，他折磨你，逼你变成了现在的样子。你应该逃离这一切，可你却在这里。穿着你那紧身衣，躺在他身上哭泣。你逃跑时抓住了他的手，你紧握着他，确保他不会受到伤害。你依然关心他……你爱他。"

She cried more and more as I explained this to her. Shinji now had the eyes of a hawk eyeing its prey.  
我向她解释这一切时，她哭得越来越厉害。真嗣此刻的眼神如同鹰隼盯着猎物。

"O how easy it is to say, then for you to actually confess it. You really are insane and so are you Shinji."  
"说起来容易，你倒是真的承认啊。你真是疯了，真嗣也是。"

"What….are….you?" Shinji said with so much murderous intent I almost flinched.  
"你……是……什么东西？" 真嗣带着如此浓烈的杀意说道，我几乎要退缩了。

"I'm the truth." I said smiling a maniacal grin.  
"我是真相。" 我笑着露出一个疯狂的笑容。

"And the truth knows all."  
"而真相无所不知。"

**I'll be honest with all 5 of you who for some reason decided to keep reading my dumb shit. I have no idea where I'm going with this, I had an idea and a twist. Now I'm abusing poor Shinji and Asuka. If you don't like this chapter, let it be known in the reviews because I don't want to piss off you guys. I'm doing this not because I'm an artist (I'm not that fucking talented). I'm doing this because I thought the idea could entertain the right type of people under the right circumstances. So, do what you want.  
说实话，我也不知道为什么你们这五个人会坚持读我这些愚蠢的东西。我对自己要写什么完全没有头绪，只有一个想法和一个转折。现在我正在虐待可怜的碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷。如果你们不喜欢这一章，请在评论中告诉我，因为我不想惹恼你们。我这么做不是因为我是个艺术家（我还没那么他妈的有才华）。我这么做是因为我觉得这个想法在合适的条件下能娱乐到特定的人群。所以，你们随意。**

### Chapter 5: Nevermind

"If the truth know all, why did it take so long for the truth to interfere?" the cold eyed Shinji said holding on to Asuka even tighter now.  
“如果真相无所不知，为什么真相要花这么长时间才介入？”眼神冷漠的碇真嗣说道，此刻他紧紧抱住明日香。

I laughed while I slowly set myself on the ground. Those dead eyes watching me the whole time, while Shinji's hands stroked Asuka's hair. Her crying was slowly dying down, it was probably because of my laughter.  
我一边笑着，一边缓缓坐到地上。那双死寂的眼睛一直盯着我，而真嗣的手轻抚着明日香的头发。她的哭泣声渐渐减弱，大概是因为我的笑声吧。

"The truth only has so much power." I said, still smiling that maniacal grin.  
“真相的力量是有限的。”我依然带着那疯狂的笑容说道。

"I could only watch everyone for the longest period of time. Watching as everyone slowly slipped into their own insanity. It was….."  
“我只能长时间地观察每一个人。看着大家逐渐陷入各自的疯狂。那真是……”

I broke. My face couldn't stop twitching and neither could my body. I fell onto my back, pain shot through my body like nothing else I have felt in a longtime. While the physical pain was a lot for me to handle, the mental pain that surfaced after years of…...torture. Was more than I could take at the current moment.  
我崩溃了。我的脸无法停止抽搐，身体也是一样。我仰面倒下，疼痛如潮水般席卷全身，这种感觉我已经很久没有体会过了。虽然身体上的痛苦让我难以承受，但多年……折磨之后浮现的心理创伤，更是让我在当下无法承受。

Why? Why am I twitching this badly? This was only showing them one of my weaknesses. I need to stop this, but how? I can't stop this, because everyone's pain is moving through my head. I can't do anything, I can't do anything, I can't do anything, I can't do anything, I can't do anything, I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything,I can't do anything.  
为什么？为什么我抽搐得这么厉害？这只是在向他们展示我的一个弱点。我需要停止这一切，但怎么做？我无法停止，因为每个人的痛苦都在我脑海中回荡。我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了，我什么都做不了。

"STOP!" I shout while freezing every part of my body.  
"停下！" 我大喊着，同时冻结了身体的每一部分。

"I CAN'T STOP IT, WHY CAN'T I STOP IT?!"  
"我停不下来，为什么我停不下来？！"

_"MAMA!" "妈妈！"_

_"PAPA!" "爸爸！"_

_"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!" "啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！"_

SNAP! I snapped my fingers, my body reset. I was invincible again, but calm. Hovering in the air, I looked down at my two patients. They were standing, but holding onto each other. Looking confused and scared at what had just happened. This wasn't the first time this has happened.  
啪！我打了个响指，身体重置了。我又变得无敌，但内心平静。悬浮在空中，我俯视着我的两位病人。他们站着，互相搀扶。脸上写满了困惑和恐惧，不明白刚刚发生了什么。这种情况已经不是第一次了。

But should I explain what just happened to them? Or should I continue on like nothing happened? How about a mixture of both. I lowered to the ground, materializing my clothes around my body. This time however, I remained invisible.  
但我应该向他们解释刚刚发生了什么吗？还是继续装作无事发生？或许两者兼而有之吧。我降到地面，身体周围幻化出衣物。然而这一次，我保持了隐身状态。

Both of them noticed me as I touched the ground, they were scared and cautious. More fight in their eyes now, with a small dose of confusion. I let my voice materialize not through a mouth, but as a divine sounding voice in the void.  
当我触地时，他们俩都注意到了我，显得既害怕又谨慎。他们的眼中多了几分斗志，夹杂着一丝困惑。我让自己的声音显现，不是通过嘴巴，而是在虚空中化作一种神圣的声音。

"...impossible for me to do anything until a certain point." I said more calm and collected rather than cocky and crazy.  
“……在某个特定时刻之前，我无法采取任何行动。”我平静而沉着地说，而非自大或疯狂。

"I apologize for that…...only being able to watch people suffer…...drives a being insane."  
"我为那件事道歉……只能眼睁睁看着人们受苦……会让一个存在发疯的。"

The two just stood there, taking in the information in strides. I wasted no time, materializing a much more comfortable chair for myself. Sitting down in it, I felt relaxed and summoned my clipboard.  
两人就那么站在那里，一步步消化着信息。我毫不浪费时间，为自己实体化了一把更舒适的椅子。坐下后，我感到放松，并召唤出了我的文件夹。

"Shinji, what is your purpose in life?" I asked taking out a pen to take notes.  
"真嗣，你人生的目的是什么？" 我问着，同时拿出笔准备记录。

He didn't answer, he just stared. Holding on to Asuka with his life and vice versa. In a sick way, this was going the way I wanted it too.  
他没有回答，只是凝视着。他与明日香紧紧相依，彼此生命相连。从某种病态的角度来看，这一切正朝着我希望的方向发展。

"Shinji, what is your purpose in life?" I asked again.  
“真嗣，你活着的意义是什么？”我又问了一遍。

This time, after a long silence, Shinji sat down on the couch. With Asuka following in sequence, both of them keeping their eyes on me.  
这一次，在长时间的沉默后，真嗣坐在了沙发上。明日香紧随其后，两人都目不转睛地盯着我。

"It was once to protect the world…...or so I thought it was?" the now broken boy looked at the ground.  
"曾经是为了保护世界……还是我自以为如此？" 如今破碎的少年凝视着地面。

After taking a note, I asked another question.  
记下笔记后，我又提出了另一个问题。

"Wasn't it to gain attention?"  
"难道不是为了引起注意吗？"

The boy kept his eyes on the ground, with Asuka now putting her forehead to his neck in a sign of affection and sympathy.  
男孩一直盯着地面，而明日香此刻将额头贴在他的脖颈上，以示爱意和同情。

"Yes, that too." “是的，那也是。”

"Well you certainly got it." I said in a dry tone as to not imply a joke.  
“好吧，你确实得到了。”我以一种干巴巴的语气说道，以免暗示这是个玩笑。

"Did it satisfy you?"  
"它让你满意了吗？"

"No, none of it did."  
"不，没有一样让我满意。"

I took a note, even though it didn't matter anymore. I had already done half the work, that spiritual touch was more than the both of them could handle. I had to tell them the honest truth.  
我记下了一笔，尽管这已经无关紧要。我已经完成了大半工作，那种精神上的触动是他们两人都无法承受的。我必须告诉他们真相。

Chucking the clipboard to the side, I leaned forward.  
我把夹纸板扔到一边，身体前倾。

"Shinji, you're not alone. You never were, you simply perceived yourself as being lonely. There were so many moments where you could have saved yourself from the endless isolation, but those are gone now."  
“真嗣，你并不孤单。你从未孤单过，只是你觉得自己孤独。有很多时刻你本可以把自己从无尽的孤立中拯救出来，但那些都过去了。”

Shinji looked up, with cold eyes mixed with anger. He turned to Asuka and kissed her on the lips, then stood up. Looking at me with the most intense eyes I have ever seen.  
真嗣抬起头，眼中混杂着冷漠与愤怒。他转向明日香，吻了她的唇，然后站起身来。用我从未见过的最强烈的目光看着我。

"What's the point of this? All your doing is fucking with us, while you yourself need help just as much as us. I see what your doing, trying to give us therapy. WHAT FUCKING THERAPY SHOWS US A HISTORY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD! THEN A HISTORY OF ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY!"  
"这有什么意义？你只是在耍我们，而你自己同样需要帮助。我看得出来你在做什么，试图给我们做心理治疗。什么狗屁治疗会给我们展示整个世界的历史！然后是我们所有朋友和家人的历史！"

"The kind that allows you to see the truth, the kind that tries to fix what can't be fixed." I say in a somber tone, now looking down myself.  
""那种让你看清真相的治疗，那种试图修复无法修复之物的治疗。"" 我以一种沉重的语气说道，现在自己也低头看着地面。

"WHAT THE FUCK?! TAKE US BACK, SEND US BACK TO THE WORLD THAT WE BELONG! NOT THIS FUCKED UP PURGATORY!"  
"搞什么鬼？！送我们回去，把我们送回我们属于的世界！不是这个该死的炼狱！"

I stand myself up. "Then do what? Die on the beach? Choke each other death, you can't do anything."  
我站起身来。“那又怎样？死在沙滩上？互相掐死对方，你们什么也做不了。”

An awkward silence, with only the noises of Shinji's heavy breathing and Asuka's crying taking up space.  
一阵尴尬的沉默，只有真嗣沉重的呼吸声和明日香哭泣的声音在空气中回荡。

"You" I took a step forward, "are" I walked right up to him and grabbed him. His eyes now terrified and looking to where my head would be. As my gloves grabbed him by the collar. "DOOMED! AND SO IS SHE!"  
“你”我向前迈了一步，“们”我径直走到他面前并抓住了他。他的眼神现在充满了恐惧，望向我头部的位置。当我的手套抓住他的衣领时，“注定要完蛋！她也一样！”

The sound of my voice nearly made them deaf, they were both covering their ears. I snapped my fingers, fixing their hearing in less than a second. I didn't care if they saw my disability, it was too late to hide the truth.  
我的声音几乎让他们失聪，两人都捂住了耳朵。我打了个响指，不到一秒就恢复了他们的听力。我不在乎他们是否看到我的残疾，隐藏真相已经太迟了。

I forced the terrified Shinji right next to Shinji, materializing my body in the process. They both gave me that cautious look, both of them clinging onto each other. I looked down on the with a pained look. I moved my chair over to me without touching it and sat down in it.  
我强行将惊恐的 Shinji 拉到 Shinji 身边，同时实体化了自己的身体。他们俩都用那种谨慎的眼神看着我，紧紧相依。我带着痛苦的表情俯视着他们。我隔空将椅子移到我身边，坐了下来。

After another long silence, looking at Shinji I said.  
又是一阵漫长的沉默后，我看着 Shinji 说道。

"You….are…" I signed while looking at the ground. My hands messaged my head while I looked for an answer.  
"你……是……" 我一边看着地面一边用手语表达。我的双手按摩着头部，同时我寻找着答案。

"...right. I should send you back, I should put you both back in your own world. But I can't, not until your…...fixed."  
"……对。我应该送你回去，我应该把你们俩都送回你们自己的世界。但我不能，直到你们……被修复。"

Another long silence. 又是一阵漫长的沉默。

"What qualifies as fixed?" Asuka asked.  
"什么算是固定的？" 明日香问道。

"When both of you settle your differences and make love."  
"当你们俩解决了分歧并相爱时。"

The awkwardness just shot up to eleven. I couldn't even look at them, what the fuck was I doing? Telling them the truth like that, now I just made it harder for me.  
尴尬指数瞬间飙升至十一。我甚至不敢看他们，我到底在干什么？像那样告诉他们真相，现在我让事情变得更难办了。

When I finally looked up. The same look was still on their faces, I was so embarrassed. After I looked down again, I asked a question.  
当我终于抬起头时，他们脸上依旧是那种表情，我感到无比尴尬。再次低下头后，我问了一个问题。

"You know what you remind me of Shinji?"  
“你知道你让我想起了谁吗，真嗣？”

Another long silence, followed by another question.  
又是一阵漫长的沉默，接着又是一个问题。

"What?" Shinji said in a scared voice.  
"什么？" 真嗣用害怕的声音说道。

"A song, by an artist you've never heard of. Because he doesn't exist in your world."  
"一首歌，来自一个你从未听说过的艺术家。因为他在你的世界里并不存在。"

I could sense that both of them were now even more focused on me, so I didn't waste time. I summoned my CD player and another CD. One of my most favorites albums of all time. After I put the CD in and was about to hit play. I heard yet another question.  
我能感觉到他们俩现在更加专注地盯着我，所以我没浪费时间。我召唤出我的 CD 播放器和另一张 CD。这是我一直以来最喜欢的一张专辑。我把 CD 放进去，正要按下播放键时，又听到了另一个问题。

"What are you?" Asuka asked.  
"你是什么人？" 明日香问道。

"Only a fan." "只是一个粉丝。"

As I hit the play button, a certain song played. A guitar riff so famous, it nearly made me cry. I was showing this song to them, they would never have been able to hear this or any of the other songs without me. Nor even understand any of them.  
当我按下播放键，某首特定的歌曲响起。那段吉他 riff 如此著名，几乎让我落泪。我正在向他们展示这首歌，没有我，他们永远无法听到这首歌或任何其他歌曲。甚至无法理解其中的任何一首。

When the drums started playing, I touched both of their heads and showed them what I meant.  
当鼓声响起时，我轻触了他们的头，向他们展示我的意图。

_Load up on guns. 装满枪支。_

The weapons of Tokyo 3 all armed themselves.

The rest of the song plays, showing him some of the same imagery, until the end.  
歌曲的其余部分继续播放，展示了一些相同的意象，直到结束。

_A denial! (x9) 否认！（x9）_

Each time the verse is shouted, a point at which Shinji could have done something different plays. Only for it to end on the image of the Earth after the third impact. Wait, this isn't an image. I'm standing on the beach and I'm fading away. No!  
每次唱到这句时，都会播放一个真嗣本可以采取不同行动的时刻。但最终画面定格在第三次冲击后的地球上。等等，这不是画面。我正站在海滩上，身体逐渐消失。不！

I failed. 我失败了。

**I don't even know what this story is anymore, I think I'm going insane. Because I heard Nirvana's song and it scared how similar it was. I'm sorry to all the people who thought this story was going somewhere. I'm so sorry.  
我甚至不知道这个故事现在是什么了，我觉得我要疯了。因为我听到了涅槃乐队的歌，它吓到我了，因为太相似了。对于那些认为这个故事会有所发展的人，我深感抱歉。非常抱歉。**

### Chapter 6: Results

I sigh the longest sigh I've ever done in my 20 years of life. I facepalm and look at my computer screen with regret and denial. What have I done? This isn't what I wanted to write about, nor did I expect it to go the way that it did. I don't have any control over this story anymore, might as well join it.  
我叹出了有生以来最长的叹息，这 20 年里从未如此。我捂脸，悔恨与否认交织地盯着电脑屏幕。我到底做了什么？这不是我想写的，也没料到会发展成这样。我对这个故事已经失去了控制，不如干脆加入其中。

A portal opens up in front of me and I step through it. I free fall for a minute, but I feel the power my pupil had flow through me. I change my clothes from a t-shirt and shorts. Into what looks like a detective movie outfit, trenchcoat, boots, black clothes underneath and gloves. I don't need a hat, I do need some weed though.  
一个传送门在我面前打开，我踏了进去。自由落体了一会儿，但我感受到我的学生力量在我体内流动。我换下了 T 恤和短裤，穿上了一套侦探电影里的装扮：风衣、靴子、黑色内衣和手套。我不需要帽子，但我确实需要一些大麻。

Right before I enter the disturbing alternate version of Earth. I replace the contents of the cigars in my trench coat pocket, with the strongest Cannabis in the universe. I'm going to need it so I don't look at a massive disembodied head that's smiling at me with red eyes, and immediately piss myself. It works as I smoke one of them as the blackness around me begins to fade.  
就在我进入这个令人不安的地球替代版本之前，我将风衣口袋里的雪茄换成了全宇宙最强的大麻。我需要它，以免看到一个巨大的、红眼微笑的无头躯体时，当场吓尿。正如我所料，当我点燃一支，周围的黑暗开始消退时，它起了作用。

I glide down onto the blood red sea, my feet touch the water and I stand on it. I look around, this world is what I expected it to be, broken. I already know the sights, I've seen the show and watched the movie. It doesn't take away the horror, sadness and isolation. Might as well get this over with, so I throw that cannabis cigar into the red water.  
我轻盈地降落在血红色的海上，双脚触及水面，稳稳站立。环顾四周，这个世界正如我所预料，支离破碎。那些景象我早已熟悉，无论是剧集还是电影。恐惧、悲伤与孤立并未因此减轻。不如速战速决，于是我将那根大麻雪茄扔进了红水之中。

"Where are they?" I ask myself.  
“他们在哪儿？”我自问道。

I reach out with my mind and….  
我用心感应，伸展出意识……

Nothing. 什么都没有。

Shinji….Asuka...their not here. Where are…...oh. They must still be in the void. 'SNAP'. The noise of me snapping my fingers echoes across the earth, there seems to be no more natural noise anymore. That is until the lightning and massive light coming from the nearby beach take up my senses.  
真嗣….明日香...他们不在这里。在哪里…...哦。他们一定还在虚空中。‘啪’。我打响指的声音在地球上回荡，似乎再也没有自然的声音了。直到附近的沙滩上出现闪电和巨大的光芒占据了我的感官。

I don't hear screaming after the light is gone, looks they've gotten used to it. Either that, or they're still recovering from that Nirvana shit. Either way, they're on the beach in the same positions. I can sense…...oh. I spoke to soon, something is different. They're holding hands.  
光芒消失后我没有听到尖叫声，看来他们已经习惯了。要么就是这样，要么他们还在从那涅槃的破事中恢复。无论如何，他们还在沙滩上，保持着同样的姿势。我能感觉到…...哦。我说的太早了，有些不同。他们正手牵手。

_Rape me, rape me my friend.  
强暴我吧，强暴我吧，我的朋友。_

I begin to sing a little as I walk on the water towards their location.  
我一边向他们的位置走去，一边轻轻地唱起歌来。

_Rape me, rape me my again.  
强暴我，再次强暴我吧。_

God….I need to get a life.

My voice sounds like gravel is going through a woodchipper, I can't sing to save my life.  
我的声音听起来像砂石在碎木机里翻滚，唱歌简直要命。

_Hate me. 恨我吧。_

_Do it and do it again.  
一遍又一遍地做。_

Halfway there, I lit up another cannabis cigar. The sensation gave me comfort, while also reminding me not to go mad. Again, I let the ashes and cigar fall into the red void.  
走到一半，我又点燃了一支大麻雪茄。那种感觉让我感到安慰，同时也提醒自己不要发疯。我又一次让烟灰和雪茄掉进了红色的虚空中。

_Waste me. 浪费我吧。_

_Rape me, my friend. 强奸我吧，我的朋友。_

I can sort of see the two on the beach. They seem to be  
我隐约能看到海滩上的两个人。他们似乎在

As my feet touch the beach, the two back up. Closer and clinging to each other than ever before.  
当我的脚触碰到沙滩时，他们俩后退了几步。比以往任何时候都更紧密地依偎在一起。

(_Quietly) Rape me._ （轻声）强奸我。

I stood a good ten yards away from them, I don't know what terrified them more. The fact that a man in a trench coat just walked on water singing Rape Me. Or the fact that I was standing right in view of the giant decapitated head. I admit, I was a little terrified myself, I'm not some character I created. I'm the real me, standing in front of two children who just experienced a new version of hell.  
我站在离他们十码远的地方，我不知道是什么让他们更害怕。是一个穿着风衣的男人在水上行走并唱着《强奸我》这首歌，还是我正站在那颗巨大的断头旁边。我承认，我自己也有点害怕，我不是我创造的那个角色。我是真实的我，站在两个刚刚经历了一场新版地狱的孩子面前。

Of course my first reaction wasn't to explain to them who I was. I just stood there, giving them my stone cold look, resting bitch face as everyone calls it. I did this and they just stared back with cautious terror filled looks. What a joke. I pulled another one of those cannabis cigars out and smoked it. I took my eyes off of them when I smoked it. I looked like one of those detectives in those movies I'm sure they've never seen.  
当然，我的第一反应并不是向他们解释我是谁。我只是站在那里，摆出我那冷若冰霜的表情，也就是大家所说的‘臭脸’。我这么做，他们只是带着充满警惕的恐惧表情回望着我。真是笑话。我又抽出一根大麻雪茄，点燃了它。抽烟时，我把目光从他们身上移开。我看起来肯定像那些电影里的侦探，我敢肯定他们从未看过。

There was a long silence between us, as I stood there smoking.  
我们之间陷入了长时间的沉默，我站在那里抽着烟。

"What…." Shinji said, then stopped and covered his mouth.  
“什…” 真嗣开口说道，然后停了下来，捂住了嘴。

"What….is this?" he asked in perfect english. Despite his best efforts to speak japanese. I smirked at that.  
"这…是什么？"他用流利的英语问道。尽管他尽力说日语，我还是对此嗤之以鼻。

"Apologies….I'm not speaking japanese. Not in here or out there, because I suck I at it."  
"抱歉…我不会说日语。无论在这里还是外面，因为我实在不擅长。"

Both of them looked at each other, then back to me.  
他们俩互相看了一眼，然后又回头看向我。

"Are…...you him again." Asuka asked, also surprised that she spoke perfect english.  
"你……又是他吗？" 明日香问道，同样惊讶于自己能说一口流利的英语。

"...no. If you are referring to that Frasier Crane sounding nutcase." I looked away and started walking around them towards solid rock.  
"不，如果你指的是那个听起来像弗雷泽·克兰的疯子。" 我转过头，开始绕过他们走向坚硬的岩石。

"He's dead, I found no need for him anymore." I reached the grass and looked at the remains of Tokyo-3, along with Lilith's arm in the background. I still kept my stone cold look on me.  
"他已经死了，我不再需要他了。" 我走到草地上，望着东京-3 的废墟，以及背景中莉莉丝的手臂。我依然保持着冷若冰霜的表情。

Another long silence, until I looked back at the ground and put my fingers between my eyes in a look of regret.  
又是一阵漫长的沉默，直到我再次低头，用手指按在眉间，流露出悔意。

"I'm sorry." I finally said. I then removed my hand and looked at them again.  
"对不起。" 我终于说道。随后我放下手，再次望向他们。

"At least, someone should be. The amount of pain you have suffered, and only now do both of you realize that you need each other."  
"至少，应该有人感到抱歉。你所承受的痛苦如此之多，而直到现在你们俩才意识到彼此的需要。"

They looked confused, then embarrassed…..then…admit. Like they refused to let go of each other.  
他们看起来先是困惑，接着是尴尬……然后……承认了。就像他们不愿放开彼此。

"Who are you?" they both said in unison. Which would have taken me aback if I wasn't stoned. Instead, I just looked at them and for once in my pathetic life. I told the truth.  
“你是谁？”他们异口同声地说。如果不是我正醉醺醺的，这可能会让我吃惊。相反，我只是看着他们，在我这可悲的一生中，第一次说了实话。

"My name is Duff." I said walking back down onto the sand.  
“我叫达夫。”我边说边走回沙滩上。

"I'm the author of what people would call a Fanfic, particularly the one you two are taking part in."  
"我是人们所说的同人文的作者，尤其是你们两位正在参与的那一篇。"

The look on their faces, priceless. Pure wide eyed confusion.  
他们脸上的表情，无价之宝。纯粹的茫然和困惑，眼睛睁得大大的。

"I did this because I was saddened by the ending of your particular story."  
"我这样做是因为我对你们故事的结局感到悲伤。"

I walked closer to them, this time they didn't back up.  
我向他们走近，这次他们没有后退。

"Watching the last remaining humans on earth live in absolute misery. While the world around them was destroyed and ruined."  
目睹地球上最后幸存的人类在绝对的苦难中苟延残喘。而周围的世界已被摧毁，满目疮痍。

I was right next to them, looking down at them both. They were both 14 after all.  
我紧挨着他们，低头看着两人。毕竟，他们都只有 14 岁。

"All because outside forces were unsatisfied with the world around them. Pathetic."  
"全因外界力量对周遭世界不满。可悲。"

I gave them a look of distaste, they still gave me that confused look.  
我给了他们一个厌恶的眼神，他们依旧是一脸困惑。

"So…..I continued your story. To satisfy my own needs, the need to see you two happy. At least once."  
"所以……我继续了你的故事。为了满足我自己的需求，想看到你们俩幸福的愿望。至少一次。"

I looked away, a pained look somehow came through my stone cold face.  
我移开视线，尽管面无表情如石雕，痛苦的神色却悄然流露。

"We're…...just a story?"  
“我们……只是个故事？”

Shinji's question hit me like a bee sting, precise and painful.  
真嗣的问题如蜂蜇般精准而痛苦地刺中了我。

"Yes." I responded quietly after a long silence.  
“是的。”我沉默良久后轻声回应。

"Who ...created us?" Asuka asked.  
“谁……创造了我们？”明日香问道。

Another long silence, I looked at them again. They were still holding onto to each other. With looks of curiosity and terror.  
又是一阵漫长的沉默，我再次看向他们。他们依旧紧紧相拥，脸上带着好奇与恐惧交织的表情。

"Hideaki Anno…...he…...did this as revenge for how the fandom treated him."  
庵野秀明……他……这么做是为了报复粉丝对他的态度。

I looked down, my anger swelled through me.  
我低头看着，怒火在我心中升腾。

"The fucker would do this to you two, all because he hated the people who sent him death threats."  
这个混蛋会这样对你们俩，就因为他恨那些给他发死亡威胁的人。

Another long silence, I simply turned around and started to walk towards the sea.  
又是一阵漫长的沉默，我只是转过身，开始向大海走去。

"I want you two to do something…..never let go."  
“我希望你们俩做一件事……永远不要放手。”

My feet touched the red ocean as I stopped on top of it.  
我的脚触碰到了红色的海洋，我在其上停下了脚步。

"Keep together, the two of you were meant for each other."  
"你们俩在一起，注定是天作之合。"

Before I could take another step, Shinji stopped me.  
我还没来得及迈出另一步，真嗣就拦住了我。

"How do you know?...For all you know, we might…" the boy couldn't even finish his sentence. As he started to cry, then hugged Asuka. She was taken aback by this for a second, but then welcomed it.  
"你怎么知道的？……说不定我们……" 男孩连话都没说完。他开始哭泣，然后抱住了明日香。她一时有些惊讶，但随即接受了这份拥抱。

"You….idoit." she said with serenity.  
"你……傻瓜。" 她平静地说道。

I turned around to view the sight.  
我转过身来，观赏这一幕。

.

.

.

.

.

.

.

It was beautiful. 真是美极了。

Shinji then looked Asuka in the eyes.  
真嗣随后凝视着明日香的双眼。

"I'm…" still crying. "...so sorry."  
"我…" 仍在哭泣。 "...非常抱歉。"

"I know." she responded. Their kiss was bittersweet to see in person. They started to make out, until they realized that I was watching. Both look at me with embarrassment. I turned around and started walking out onto the sea.  
"我知道。" 她回应道。他们亲吻的场面在现场看来带着一丝苦涩。他们开始拥吻，直到意识到我在观看。两人都尴尬地看向我。我转过身，开始走向海中。

"Time to fix this shit."  
"是时候解决这破事了。"

The world around me started to shake, I levitated and looked at that damn smiling head.  
周围的世界开始摇晃，我悬浮起来，盯着那该死的笑脸头颅。

"You will be the first to go."  
"你将是第一个消失的。"

(Led Zeppelin-No Quarter)  
(齐柏林飞艇-四分之一)

The music starts to play, the world stops shaking. I pull my hands out of my pockets. Once the drums start to join, I raise them. Slowly the limbs of Lilith start to turn to dust. I lower my arms to have them and my hands remain straight, I look down at the ocean.  
音乐响起，世界停止摇晃。我把手从口袋里抽出。当鼓声加入时，我举起它们。莉莉丝的四肢渐渐化为尘埃。我放下手臂，让它们和我的手保持笔直，我低头看向海洋。

_Close the door, put out the light.  
关上门，熄灭灯光。_

As the lyrics begins, the red in the ocean slowly starts to turn blue.  
当歌词响起，海洋中的红色缓缓开始转为蓝色。

_Why no they won't be home tonight, ohh.  
为何他们今晚不会回家，哦。_

The seas aren't fully blue yet, I point with my fingers out into the world.  
大海尚未完全变蓝，我伸出手指指向世界。

_The snow falls hard and don't you know.  
雪花纷纷扬扬，你可知道。_

The two children on the beach are given coats, as they appear at their feet.  
海滩上的两个孩子得到了外套，它们悄然出现在他们脚边。

_The winds of Thor are blowing cold.  
索尔之风正吹得寒冷。_

The water is completely blue now, though the world shakes again. As I stretch out my arms and hands to change the atmosphere. This is taking a lot of strength, but I pull the Earth back to the way it was.  
此刻水面已是一片湛蓝，尽管世界再次颤动。我伸展双臂，试图改变这氛围。这需要极大的力量，但我努力将地球拉回原样。

_They're wearing steel that's bright and true, ooh.  
他们身着闪亮而真实的钢铁，哦。_

_They carry news that must get through.  
他们携带着必须传递的消息。_

I nearly break, my body is in absolute pain, but my reward appears.  
我几乎崩溃，身体痛不欲生，但回报终于显现。

_They choose a path where no one goes.  
他们选择了一条无人涉足的道路。_

The cold January wind feels good against my face. Especially for how hot it was when I arrived.  
一月凛冽的寒风拂面而来，感觉格外舒爽。尤其是刚抵达时那般酷热。

_They hold no quarter. 他们毫不留情。_

_They hold no quarter, ahh.  
他们毫不留情，啊。_

I smile, close my eyes and spin in the air, letting myself be one with the music. As the clouds begin to snow and the cold never felt this good. However, I stop and focus. More work must be done.  
我微笑着，闭上眼睛，在空中旋转，让自己与音乐融为一体。当云层开始飘雪，寒冷从未如此美好。然而，我停下并集中注意力。还有更多工作要做。

I stick my arms out in front of me and start moving my fingers like I'm controlling puppets. I hear the remains of Tokyo-3 start to rebuild, massive structures across the world once destroyed beyond any reasonable repair. Cities completely flooded and covered in water. Now put back together like it was nothing.  
我伸出双臂，开始像操控木偶一样移动手指。我听到东京-3 的残骸开始重建，世界各地曾被摧毁到无法修复的巨大结构。完全被洪水淹没和覆盖的城市。现在却像没事一样重新组合起来。

Enough of my gloating, now for the tricky part. I put my arms at my sides, close my eyes and calm myself. The LCL begins to move.  
我的得意够了，现在是棘手的部分。我将双臂放在身体两侧，闭上眼睛，让自己平静下来。LCL 开始移动。

_Walking side by side with death.  
与死亡并肩而行。_

_The devil mocks their every step, ooh.  
恶魔嘲弄着他们每一步，哦。_

_The snow drives back the foot that's slow.  
雪花逼退了迟缓的脚步。_

_The dogs of doom are howling more, oh.  
末日的犬吠愈发狂烈，噢。_

_They carry news that must get through.  
他们传递着必须送达的消息。_

_To build a dream for me and you.  
为了你我共同构筑的梦想。_

_They choose the path where no one goes.  
他们选择了无人涉足的道路。_

I opened my eyes.  
我睁开了眼睛。

The LCL of those who caused this are in front of me.

"God is in his heaven, all is right."  
“上帝在他的天堂，一切都是对的。”

I swing my right arm out and make all of Seele disappear.  
我挥动右臂，让 Seele 的一切消失无踪。

_They need no quarter, aaaah.  
他们无需怜悯，啊啊啊。_

I turn and look down on two on the beach. The beach now a blotch of sand in the middle of field. Shadowed by the buildings of the original Tokyo.  
我转身俯视海滩上的两人。海滩如今成了田野中央的一块沙斑，被原东京的建筑阴影笼罩。

I descend, my trench coat gliding down in the wind. They're wearing the coats I gave them, they look at my with astonishment and wonder. When I touch the ground, I light one more cigar and smile at them. Puffing smoke out into the world one more time.  
我缓缓降下，风衣随风飘扬。他们穿着我赠予的大衣，目光中满是惊异与好奇。当我触地时，点燃又一支雪茄，向他们微笑。再次向世界吐出烟雾。

"It has been a pleasure to be in your presence." As a portal opens up behind me and I appear at my desk. In front of my computer, but I can still see them.  
“与你们同在真是荣幸。”一道传送门在我身后开启，我出现在办公桌前。面对电脑，却仍能看见他们。

Shinji and Asuka looking at the hoard of confused naked people. Them uniting with their friends, allies…..mothers. I watch them enjoy the world I created for them, watch them enjoy each other's company. Watch them enjoy each other's physical presence. Watch them start a family.  
真嗣和明日香望着那群困惑的裸体人群。他们与朋友、盟友……母亲们团聚。我看着他们享受我为他们创造的世界，享受彼此的陪伴。感受彼此的实体存在。看着他们组建家庭。

**I'm sorry for the delay on this one. Call it writer's block or lack of imagination. Let it be known, that I did not expect this story to become as popular as it did. I hope this was satisfying, because I didn't know how else to truly end it.
