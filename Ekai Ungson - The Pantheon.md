_From a distance, only the light is visible, a speeding gleaming horizontal angel, trumpet out on a hard bend. The note bells, the beauty of the stretching train that pulls the light in a long gold thread. It catches in the wheels, it flashes on the doors, that open and close, that open and close, in commuter rhythm.  
从远处看，只能看到那道光，一道疾驰的闪亮水平天使，在急转弯处吹响号角。音符如钟声，美妙的是那延伸的列车，牵引着光线形成一条长长的金色丝线。它缠绕在车轮上，闪烁在开合的门上，开合，开合，遵循着通勤的节奏。_

### Chapter 1Elios, of the Light
Darkness is nothing but the sheer absence of light, and of late there was scarce anything illuminated by it. Dark halls, dark floors, dim rooms and corners and alleys. There was hardly a glimmer of it anywhere.  
黑暗不过是光明的绝对缺失，而近来几乎没有被它照亮的地方。黑暗的走廊，黑暗的地板，昏暗的房间、角落和巷子。几乎无处可见一丝光明。

On the black floors and inky walls the darkness crept, catching on sharp corners that knife it in half. It adheres but does not die, instead the two parts merely go on to surround more things with murk.  
在黑色的地板和墨色的墙壁上，黑暗悄然蔓延，被锋利的角落一分为二。它依附却不消亡，两部分只是继续用阴暗包围更多事物。

A boy entered a room stricken with the freezing shadows of cold metal and frigid machines. Everything in the enclosed space is cold-frozen with ice from the curtains that hung from a metal divider, unresponsive to the stale air, to the electrical equipment that beeped slowly, supposedly indicating life, when, in fact, it gave off only a slow sound of death, to the scarcity of illumination, and finally, to the prone figure lying on the bed with frail hands on the covers, fingers chilled with the absence of life.  
一个男孩走进了一个被冰冷金属和冰冷机器的阴影笼罩的房间。封闭空间内的一切都被冰封：从金属隔板上挂着的窗帘，对陈腐空气无动于衷，到缓慢发出哔哔声的电子设备，本应指示生命迹象，实则只发出缓慢的死亡之声；再到光照的稀缺，最终，是床上躺着的那个身影，覆盖着被子的手苍白无力，手指因生命的缺失而冰冷。

He stood beside the bed, ignoring the chair beside it, with shoulders sloped downwards with the weight of defeat and discontent. He stared at the pale face of the girl that lay unmoving before him and breathed in and out. He did not know why he still tried.  
他站在床边，无视旁边的椅子，肩膀因失败和不满足的重压而下垂。他凝视着面前一动不动的女孩苍白的脸，呼吸着。他不知道自己为何还在尝试。

Ikari Shinji could do nothing but sigh once more. "Hey, Asuka," he began, unsure. "Guess I'm here again"  
碇真嗣除了再次叹息，别无他法。“嘿，明日香，”他开始说道，语气中带着不确定。“我想我又来了。”

He paused, unsure of what to say next to the girl whose eyes refused to flutter open, refused now for six days and counting.  
他停顿了一下，不知道接下来该对这个女孩说什么，她的眼睛拒绝睁开，已经持续了六天，并且还在继续。

"I never go home anymore. Nobody goes home. Everybody wants me to stay here, at headquarters. They keep telling me that something's going to happen. Misato never goes home either, but I don't think she's working"  
“我再也不回家了。没人回家。每个人都希望我留在总部。他们不断告诉我，会有事情发生。美里也从不回家，但我不认为她在工作。”

The closed eyes of the Second Child remained closed. Nothing changed in the girl's expression. The machine in the corner beeped constantly, and the one dim bulb lending him sight was casting fleeting shadows across her pale face, her skin a stark contrast to the overwhelming dark.  
二号机的眼睛依旧紧闭。女孩的表情没有任何变化。角落里的机器持续发出哔哔声，那唯一一盏昏暗的灯在他眼前投下转瞬即逝的阴影，她的苍白面容与四周的浓重黑暗形成鲜明对比。

"Hikari's been very worried about you, Asuka but I've never gotten the chance to talk to her lately. I haven't gone to school in a long time. I think I'm falling behind on Algebra"  
“光子一直很担心你，明日香，但我最近都没机会和她说话。我已经很久没去学校了。我想我在代数上已经落后了。”

Translucent eyelids never opened. Slender fingers never moved. There was nary even the sound of breathing. Pale, weak light tried to diffuse itself as much as it could, but did not succeed outside of a dim glow.  
透明的眼睑未曾张开。纤细的手指未曾动弹。甚至连呼吸声都听不见。微弱的光线尽力想要散开，却只维持着一团黯淡的光晕。

"Asuka I feel so alone," he admitted miserably. And he did. And he couldn't possibly fathom why Asuka would care about all these mundane things about his life, about himself and how he was feeling. Asuka's business was Asuka's alone. And she, from all accounts, never cared about anyone else. But he needed someone to listen to him, and outside of the fallen Pilot there was no one else. And so, regardless of her unconsciousness, he talked, and kept talking. "I don't know who to turn to anymore I'm afraid of Ayanami and Misato. They scare me"  
"Asuka，我感到如此孤独，" 他痛苦地承认。他的确如此。他无法理解为什么 Asuka 会关心他生活中的这些琐事，关心他的感受。Asuka 的事只是 Asuka 自己的事。据他所知，她从不关心别人。但他需要有人倾听，除了这位昏迷的驾驶员外，别无他人。因此，尽管她处于无意识状态，他还是继续说着，不停地诉说。"我不知道该向谁求助了，我害怕绫波和美里。她们让我害怕"

Nothing shifted the silence that rapidly filled the spaces. It was thick, dense, and deafening. The girl's closed eyes remained closed, and he begged for them to open. He knew he was talking the exact sort of gibberish she hated to hear, from him or from anybody.  
没有任何声音打破这迅速填满空间的寂静。它是如此厚重、密集且震耳欲聋。女孩紧闭的双眼依旧紧闭，他祈求它们能睁开。他知道自己正在说那种她最讨厌听到的胡言乱语，无论是来自他还是任何人。

"Asuka, please," the boy pleaded, taking the girl's hand. It was freezing. He pushed the feeling of recoil aside. "Asuka, please wake up. Please, wake up, Asuka—"  
"Asuka，求你了，" 男孩恳求道，握住女孩的手。那手冰冷无比。他压下想要退缩的感觉。"Asuka，请醒醒。求你了，醒来吧，Asuka——"

Closed eyes remained closed.  
紧闭的双眼依旧紧闭。

"Asuka, wake up, please open your eyes. I'm so alone. I—" he stopped short and urged on, his voice taking on a higher tinge of desperation. "I need you, Asuka. Wake up and yell at me. Make me strong. Make me brave. Shout at me, insult me, I don't care. Asuka, wake up"  
“明日香，醒醒，求你睁开眼睛。我好孤单。我——”他突然停住，声音中带着更强烈的绝望。“我需要你，明日香。醒来对我大吼吧。让我坚强，让我勇敢。对我咆哮，辱骂我，我不在乎。明日香，醒来吧。”

Closed eyes remained closed.  
紧闭的双眼依旧紧闭。

The boy was on the verge of tears.  
男孩眼眶泛红，泪水几欲夺眶而出。

"Asuka, please I'm sorry"  
"Asuka, 请原谅我"

_Apologies are your conditioned reaction, Shinji! What, do you think you cause everything to go wrong?  
道歉是你习惯性的反应，真嗣！难道你以为所有错事都是你造成的吗？_

Her closed eyes remained closed.  
她紧闭的双眼依旧紧闭着。

Realizing the futility of his actions, the boy set the girl's hand down on the covers and stared at her with remorse in his eyes. He had been able to do not much lately but feel absolute guilt and stare at her. He knew she hated him for it, would hate him for it.  
意识到自己行为的徒劳，男孩轻轻将女孩的手放回被子上，眼中满是悔恨地凝视着她。最近他除了感到深深的愧疚和凝视她之外，几乎什么也做不了。他知道她会因此恨他，永远恨他。

Unresponsive, like the dolls she so hated, the shadows on her face deepening the hollow spaces on her cheeks, he wished desperately for her eyes of sky to ignite something in him. He wished desperately for her life or his death—either way, it did not matter much. The red silk of her hair, brilliant in the sun, lacked luster now, and the spiritless slumber that had overtaken her had reduced her radiance considerably.  
她毫无反应，就像她所讨厌的那些玩偶一样，脸上的阴影加深了她脸颊的凹陷，他迫切希望她那如天空般的眼睛能点燃他内心的某种东西。他迫切希望她能活过来，或者他死去——无论哪种方式，都无关紧要。她那在阳光下闪耀的红发，如今失去了光泽，她那无精打采的沉睡大大削弱了她的光彩。

_Asuka, won't you shine? 明日香，你不会闪耀吗？_

He remembered a tale he'd heard as a child, about the sleeping princess on a tower, sealed away from the rest of the world. He connected this thought to the current situation. Far-fetched and implausible given the current circumstances, where real life and reality collided violently, and there was no hope for such asinine fairy tales—  
他记得小时候听过的一个故事，关于塔上沉睡的公主，被隔绝在世界之外。他将这个想法与当前的情景联系起来。在现实生活与现实激烈碰撞的当下，这种牵强且难以置信的情节，本应毫无希望——

--but at this point he was about ready to believe anything.  
——但到了这个地步，他几乎准备相信任何事情了。

Driven by guilt, sorrow, and desperation, fueled by the knowledge that the girl would not wake, but placing each smoky bet on the belief that this might actually work—he lowered his head, closer, closer to hers, and pressed his lips against hers for the most infinite of moments.  
被愧疚、悲伤和绝望驱使，怀着那女孩不会醒来的认知，却仍将每一次如烟的赌注押在这可能奏效的信念上——他低下头，越来越近，越来越近，最终将双唇紧贴在她的唇上，停留了无比漫长的一刻。

But she did not wake. Made no move to resist or return his actions, which was even more highly unlikely. She remained feeble and limp, without strength, without soul.  
但她并未醒来。没有做出任何抵抗或回应的动作，这甚至更加不可能。她依旧虚弱无力，毫无生气。

Her closed eyes remained closed, and his dark surroundings remained dark, reminding him of the hopelessness of the situation.  
她紧闭的双眼依旧紧闭，四周的黑暗依旧深沉，这一切都在提醒他情况的绝望。

_Asuka, won't you shine? 明日香，你不会发光吗？_

She would not. 她不会这么做。

And this was what broke him most deeply.  
而这正是最深切地击溃他的原因。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He left the room in considerable distress, closing the door quietly behind him, even if he knew that the girl within could not possibly hear. Still feeling the imprint of her frigid lips against his own, he fought back incredible shame and self-disgust, and tears. He ran from the room without looking back. Asuka would never wake. Maybe she didn't want to, anymore.  
他带着相当大的困扰离开了房间，轻轻地关上门，尽管他知道里面的女孩不可能听到。依然能感受到她冰冷双唇的印记，他强忍着难以言喻的羞愧和自我厌恶，以及泪水。他没有回头，径直跑出了房间。明日香永远不会醒来。也许她再也不想醒来了。

He wished he could do the same.  
他多么希望自己也能如此。

Meanwhile, in another part of NERV HQ, in the synch test room, Akagi Ritsuko stood up and wiped her glasses on her lab coat, absently scanning the screens in front of her, and the glass windows where a view of two entry plugs could be seen, the first labeled 00' and the other 02'.  
与此同时，在 NERV 总部的另一处，同步测试室内，赤木律子站起身来，用实验服擦拭着眼镜，心不在焉地扫视着面前的屏幕和玻璃窗，那里可以看到两个插入栓，一个标着'00'，另一个则是'02'。

"Where's Shinji?" she asked, taking notes on a clipboard.  
“真嗣在哪里？”她问道，一边在剪贴板上做着记录。

"I don't know," Katsuragi Misato replied. "He should be just around."  
“我不知道，”葛城美里回答，“他应该就在附近。”

"Some guardian you are," Ritsuko muttered.  
"你这守护者当得可真行，" 律子低声嘟囔道。

"00 plug at 0.25," someone reported. "Synch ratio at 52% and rising."  
"00 插头在 0.25 位置，" 有人报告道，"同步率 52% 并持续上升。

"Lower her by 0.3," Ritsuko ordered. The personnel did as she commanded. "And the other?"  
“将她下降 0.3，”律子命令道。工作人员依言执行。“另一个呢？”

"The Fifth Child is at 0.34, synch ratio 70%. Stable."  
"第五个孩子位于 0.34，同步率 70%。稳定。"

"Lower him by 0.1 more."  
"再降低 0.1。"

"Right." "好的。"

Ritsuko turned to Misato once more. "What are you doing here?"  
律子再次转向美里。“你在这里做什么？”

Misato stared. "Working."  
美里盯着她。“工作。”

"You know as well as I do that I don't need you around for a standard synch test," said Ritsuko. "What are you doing here?"  
“你我都知道，进行标准同步测试并不需要你在场，”律子说道，“你到底在这里做什么？”

Misato kept staring. Misato 继续凝视着。

"They're not your Children, Misato," the doctor said. "The Children you're supposed to be looking after are not Rei and Kaworu. Your Children are in other parts of HQ, getting lost in one manner or another. The first is in a mental comatose and the other is alone in God-only-knows-where."  
"他们不是你的孩子们，美里，" 医生说道。"你应该照顾的孩子们不是丽和薰。你的孩子们在总部其他地方，以各种方式迷失了方向。一个陷入了精神昏迷，另一个则独自在只有上帝知道的地方。""

"00 has reached its limit at 0.28 meters," reported a personnel.  
"00 已经达到了 0.28 米的极限，" 一名工作人员报告道。""

"And Kaworu?" Ritsuko asked.  
"那薰呢？" 律子问道。""

"Also reached limit. Synch ratio at 75% and stable."  
也已达极限。同步率 75%且稳定。

"All right. Rei, Kaworu—"  
"好吧。丽，薰——"

Two faces went up the computer screens.  
两张脸转向了电脑屏幕。

"Yes." “是的。”

"Yes." "是的。"

"You're done. Shut it down and you may both go. Thank you."  
"你完成了。关闭它，你们可以走了。谢谢。"

"Roger." "罗杰。"

"Right." "好的。"

When Ritsuko turned around, Misato was gone.  
当 Ritsuko 转过身时，Misato 已经不见了。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The girl took five steps into the lobby in silence, the only sound reverberating was the click of her shoes on the marble tile. She kept walking onward, without aim or direction.  
女孩默默地走进大厅，五步之遥，唯一回荡的声音是她鞋跟在瓷砖上的敲击声。她继续前行，没有目标，也没有方向。

She noted that the lights overhead had dimmed slightly. Not considerable enough to be noticeable, but she had, after all, lived in this place for most of her life, and she _knew_ whether things had changed. Nothing much had, for the past years. She was contemplating this, when—  
她注意到头顶的灯光微微暗淡了些。虽然不至于明显到引人注意，但她毕竟在这地方生活了大半辈子，对事物的变化了如指掌。过去几年里，其实并没有太多改变。她正沉思着这些，就在这时——

She turned around abruptly and asked, "Why are you following me?"  
她突然转身问道：“你为什么跟着我？”

She had been followed—rather, was still being followed—by the Fifth, who, now been addressed, gave her a disarming smile.  
她一直被第五个人跟踪——更确切地说，现在仍在被跟踪——当第五个人被搭话时，他露出了一个令人卸下防备的微笑。

"Because you are silent," said the boy cheerfully.  
"因为你沉默不语，"男孩愉快地说道。

Although this did not make much sense to the First Child, she only gave him two seconds of her stare before turning around and resuming her walk.  
虽然这番话对初生之子来说并无多大意义，她只是给了他两秒钟的凝视，便转身继续前行。

She heard footsteps behind her and knew that the Fifth had not yet given up. She decided to pay him no attention and kept walking through cavernous halls that never seemed to end. Yes, this was NERV, it never seemed to end. Time, here, though precious and coveted, seemed as if it did not exist entirely.  
她听到身后传来的脚步声，知道第五号还未放弃。她决定不予理会，继续穿行在似乎永无尽头的宽敞大厅中。没错，这里是 NERV，仿佛永无止境。在这里，时间虽珍贵且令人渴望，却似乎并不完全存在。

She stopped, and the footsteps stopped also, from a calculated distance behind her. She turned around once more.  
她停下脚步，身后的脚步声也随之戛然而止，保持着一段精心计算的距离。她再次转过身来。

"Why are you following me?"  
“你为什么跟着我？”

"Because you are beautiful," came the impertinent reply, smile still in place.  
“因为你很美，”对方不客气地回答，笑容依旧挂在脸上。

Beautiful. Was she really? She turned around and pondered this. Beautiful. Beauty. How could she be beautiful? She didn't even have color in herself, in her life. And color was beautiful. Beautiful?  
美。她真的美吗？她转过身来，陷入了沉思。美。美丽。她怎么可能美丽呢？她连自己，连生活中的色彩都没有。而色彩是美丽的。美丽吗？

Beautiful is applied to that which gives the highest degree of pleasure to the senses or to the mind and suggests that the object of delight approximates one's conception of an ideal.  
美，是指给予感官或心灵最高程度的愉悦，暗示着令人愉悦的对象接近于个人对理想的构想。

She was not that.  
她并非如此。

Lovely refers to that which delights by inspiring affection or warm admiration.  
可爱指的是那种通过激发爱慕或温暖敬佩之情而令人愉悦的事物。

She was not that.  
她并非如此。

Pretty carries connotations of femininity or diminutiveness.  
漂亮带有女性化或小巧可爱的意味。

She was not that.  
她并非如此。

Comely applies to persons only and suggests a wholesome attractiveness of form and features rather than a high degree of beauty.  
Comely 特指人，暗示形态和特征的健康吸引力，而非极高的美貌程度。

She was not that.  
她并非如此。

Fair suggests beauty that is fresh, bright, or flawless.  
Fair 暗示清新、明亮或无瑕的美。

She was not that.  
她并非如此。

She barely noticed that she had turned at least three corners and was in the rather untouched' parts of NERV.  
她几乎没注意到自己已经转了至少三个弯，来到了 NERV 中颇为未受触碰的部分。

And still, the Fifth followed.  
而第五使徒依旧紧随其后。

She turned around once more and queried, once more, "Why are you following me?"  
她再次转身，又一次问道：“你为什么跟着我？”

The Fifth smiled at her. Smiling. She wondered how he could manage that.  
第五冲她微笑。微笑着。她好奇他怎么能做到这一点。

_"You're just like me" “你和我一样。”_

_No, I'm not. I'm not as happy.  
不，我不是。我没有那么快乐。_

"Because I fancy you."  
“因为我喜欢你。”

She stared. And kept staring. Finally, she came to a conclusion and said, "You fancy everyone, Nagisa."  
她盯着他，一直盯着。最终，她得出结论并说道：“你谁都喜欢，渚。”

His smile widened. "Is that not a good thing?"  
他的笑容扩大了。“这不是件好事吗？”

"I would not know of such things." And with that, she walked past him to get back to more familiar terrain.  
“我对这些事一无所知。”说完，她从他身边走过，回到更熟悉的领域。

A feeling in her abdomen began to rise. Something unfamiliar and alien to her. Something she had never yet felt before. It spread across from her stomach to the rest of her body, but she pushed it aside, and failed. She kept walking, and her steps became faster, and faster still, as if she were running away from the very feeling itself.  
一种感觉在她腹部开始升起。对她来说既陌生又异样。一种她从未体验过的感觉。它从她的胃部蔓延至全身，但她试图将其推开，却失败了。她继续前行，步伐越来越快，越来越急促，仿佛在逃离这种感觉本身。

And still, the Fifth followed.  
而第五使徒依旧紧随其后。

Ayanami Rei came to a dead end at the end of the hall, something she entirely did not anticipate. So she turned around and asked again "Why are you following me, Nagisa?"  
绫波零在走廊尽头遇到了死胡同，这是她完全没有预料到的。于是她转过身，再次问道：“碇，你为什么跟着我？”

Nagisa Kaworu stopped at a precise five steps from her, and stared.  
渚薰在她面前精确地停下五步之遥，凝视着她。

She stared back, eyes looking into identical eyes.  
她回望着，目光与那双相同的眼睛对视。

"Because," he began, "if you didn't want to be followed, you wouldn't run away, now, would you?"  
"因为，"他开口道，"如果你不想被跟踪，你就不会逃跑，对吧？"

It took some time before the gist of what he said hit her fully. And when it did, she laughed.  
过了一会儿，他话中的大意才完全击中她。当她明白过来时，她笑了。

Her shoulders were shaking uncontrollably and her eyes had narrowed into slits. She felt a sensation from very, very deep in her heart surface and blossom within her. Was this what they called laughter? She had never had this before.  
她的肩膀不由自主地颤抖着，双眼眯成了细缝。一种深藏心底、久违的感觉在她内心绽放开来。这就是他们所说的笑吗？她从未体验过这种感觉。

She laughed and laughed and he stood there with a faint smile on his face as if he were contented with only watching her.  
她笑个不停，而他站在那里，脸上挂着淡淡的微笑，仿佛光是看着她便已心满意足。

"It seems there is a lot to teach you, First Child."  
“看来有很多东西要教你，长子。”

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In another part of NERV, a woman was also wandering the premises without direction or goal. Letting her feet lead her to wherever it chose, she walked with a pace that appeared to be slurred with alcohol. She had taken none of the stuff.  
在 NERV 的另一处，一名女子同样漫无目的地徘徊着。任由双脚引领她前往任何地方，她的步伐显得有些踉跄，仿佛沾染了酒精。然而，她并未沾染任何酒精。

Katsuragi Misato had one purpose in mind, and that was to find her charge, the Third Child, Shinji. However, numerous attempts to contact the boy had been futile, and were he inside the headquarters, he wasn't listening to her pleas over the intercom. Feeling dejected and alone, she decided, rather foolishly, now that she thought about it, to search for him on foot.  
葛城美里心中只有一个目标，那就是找到她的被监护人，第三适格者，真嗣。然而，多次尝试联系这个男孩都徒劳无功，即使他在总部内，也没有回应她的对讲机呼唤。感到沮丧和孤独，她决定，现在想来颇为愚蠢地，亲自去寻找他。

Which was a really stupid idea. NERV was, in a nutshell, a gigantic facility. Ritsuko was right when she said that the boy could be in God-only-knows-where.  
这真是个愚蠢透顶的主意。NERV 简而言之，就是个庞大的设施。当律子说那男孩可能在神才知道的地方时，她是对的。

She had never been a woman of much patience. But Shinji was one thing she just couldn't give up on, now. Finding him, that is. It seemed as if she had given up on a lot of things, including the care of Shinji, over the past few days. And it had taken the excellent Ritsuko to snap her out of it.  
她从来都不是一个特别有耐心的女人。但真嗣是她现在无论如何都无法放弃的，找到他这件事。过去几天里，她似乎放弃了很多东西，包括对真嗣的照顾。是优秀的律子让她清醒过来。

Her knees were now protesting on the force she was exerting on them. She paid them no heed. She had been walking for some time now, granted, but Shinji. Shinji  
她的膝盖因承受的力度而开始抗议。她并未理会。她已经走了好一阵子了，没错，但真嗣。真嗣

She stopped and leaned against the wall in an expression of futility. She would never be able to find the Child this way. The lost, after all, would never be able to find their fellow lost.  
她停下脚步，无力地靠在墙上。这样下去，她永远也找不到那个孩子。毕竟，迷失的人永远无法找到同样迷失的同伴。

Misato looked around and realized that she had taken herself directly outside her other charge's door.  
Misato 环顾四周，意识到自己已经直接走到了她另一位被监护人的房门前。

Asuka's room. 明日香の部屋。

It was as if the place had become some refuge for the damned or shrine to the unworthy, as everyone who entered it seemed to be dealing with demons personal or otherwise. Misato entered the room and felt the cold. Almost freezing cold, and the current state of the Second Child helped none.  
这个地方仿佛变成了被诅咒者的避难所或是不配者的神龛，每个进入其中的人似乎都在与个人或其他的恶魔斗争。美里走进房间，感受到了那股寒意。几乎要冻结的寒冷，而二号机驾驶员的现状更是无济于事。

"Hello, Asuka" she began. "Sorry I haven't been here. I've been out of sorts."  
"你好，明日香。" 她开口道，"抱歉我一直没来。我最近有些心神不宁。"

Sohryu Asuka-Langley had become some sort of saint-like paragon to whom humans with voids in their respective souls went to search for some sort of solace. Maybe it was because the girl was unresponsive, verbally, that they came to her—she could do nothing but listen' to them.  
所以龙明日香-兰格雷成了某种圣人般的楷模，那些内心空洞的人们纷纷前来寻求慰藉。或许正是因为女孩沉默寡言，他们才向她倾诉——她所能做的，不过是聆听。

"I can't find Shinji anywhere, Asuka like he doesn't want to be found. I don't know what to do anymore. Asuka—"  
我到处都找不到真嗣，仿佛他不想被找到一样。我不知道该怎么办了。明日香——

Misato stared at the Child's pale countenance and encountered the same feelings of guilt that Asuka's first visitor had. "Asuka, I'm sorry I failed you, both you and Shinji I failed to protect you, failed to protect Shinji when I was supposed to. I—"  
Misato 凝视着孩子的苍白面容，心中涌起了与 Asuka 首位访客相同的愧疚感。“Asuka，对不起，我没能保护好你，你和 Shinji 我都未能守护，本该保护 Shinji 的时候我也失败了。我——”

Unlike Asuka's first visitor, however, Misato did shed tears, both for herself and for her frail charge. "—was too busy being selfish, protecting my own interests.. I didn't even think about you, about Shinji. I'm a wretched woman I don't deserve you"  
然而，与明日香的第一位访客不同，美里确实流下了眼泪，既为自己，也为她那脆弱的被保护者。“——我一直忙于自私自利，保护自己的利益……我甚至没有考虑过你，考虑过真嗣。我是个可悲的女人，我不配拥有你。”

Misato, sobbing now, took Asuka's hand from the covers and felt the chill seep from the girl's skin to hers. "You're so cold, Asuka when are you coming back?"  
美里此刻泪流满面，从被褥中握住明日香的手，感受到那股寒意从女孩的皮肤渗入自己的掌心。“你这么冰冷，明日香，你何时才能回来？”

The Second Child did not, could not, answer.

"I'm sorry for everything, Asuka I'm just like Shinji. I'm exactly like him"  
“对不起，明日香，我和真嗣一样，完全一样。”

And with that, Misato let all gates break open and cried, and cried, and cried.  
就这样，美里让所有的闸门都敞开了，她哭泣着，哭泣着，哭泣着。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Second Child, Sohryu Asuka-Langley, was dreaming.  
第二子，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，正在梦中。

She dreamt that she was in the middle of a dark, deep void, without physical constraints, much like being a spirit, or a soul, if such things truly did exist. She was in a world made up solely of feeling, and the first of those was the one called "freedom".  
她梦见自己置身于一个黑暗深邃的虚空之中，没有物理的束缚，宛如一个灵魂或精神，如果这些事物真的存在的话。她身处一个完全由感觉构成的世界，而其中首要的感觉便是所谓的“自由”。

So at peace, she felt, but when she tried to say the words none came out, for she had not the lips to say them with. However, she felt no surprise at this revelation. It seemed as if it were the most natural thing, to have no voice and no lips to talk with.  
她感到如此宁静，但当她试图说出这些话时，却发不出任何声音，因为她没有嘴唇来表达。然而，对此她并不感到惊讶。似乎没有声音和嘴唇来交谈是最自然不过的事了。

She saw not with eyes but with her entire being, and suddenly, pictures came pouring out from all sides of the void. Snapshots of herself in different parts of the world. At tourist attractions and fairs, in Germany and Spain, Indonesia, America, China. Snapshots of her sparkling, gleaming self, smiling as if she had no cares in the world. Pictures with friends and acquaintances, at school dances and her graduation, where none of her parents were present. There was one of her in her toga for her college graduation, beaming beside a proud Kaji.
她并非用双眼，而是以整个灵魂去感知，倏忽间，无数画面如潮水般从虚无的四面八方涌出。世界各地的她，在旅游景点与集市上，德国、西班牙、印尼、美国、中国。闪耀着光芒、熠熠生辉的她，笑得无忧无虑。与朋友和熟人的合影，学校舞会与毕业典礼上，父母均未出席。还有一张她穿着学士服的大学毕业照，自豪地站在骄傲的加治身旁。

Kaji. The man who had been her home for some years. She knew he was gone now, though she scarce knew even why she knew.  
加治。那个曾作为她多年归宿的男人。她知道他已离去，尽管她几乎不明白自己为何知晓。

Suddenly, all the sparkling, gleaming pictures dulled, and finally, they faded. She stared at them with a detached sort of fascination.  
突然间，所有闪耀、璀璨的画面都黯淡了下来，最终，它们消失了。她带着一种超然的迷恋凝视着它们。

_Oh Everyone's forgetting about me.  
哦，大家都把我忘了。_

_How nice for them. 他们真幸运。_

Then, a scene from her childhood. _"You're strong, Miss Asuka, but it's all right to cry."_  
接着，童年的一个场景浮现。“你很坚强，明日香小姐，但哭泣也没关系。”

_I don't want to cry. But I did. Some strength that is.  
我不想哭。但我还是哭了。这算什么坚强。_

_"Mama, Mama! They chose me! I'm an elite pilot! I'll defend mankind as the best in the world! It's a secret to everyone, but I'll tell you, Mama! Everyone's so nice to me! Everyone loves me! I'm not sad anymore, Mama! Hey, Mama! Look at me! Look at me! Me!"  
妈妈，妈妈！他们选我了！我是精英飞行员！我要作为世界最佳守护人类！这是个秘密，但我要告诉你，妈妈！大家都对我很好！大家都爱我！我不再难过了，妈妈！嘿，妈妈！看我！看我！我！_

_I didn't want to cry. But I did. Some strength that is.  
我不想哭的。但我还是哭了。真是坚强啊。_

_I don't want to live anymore.  
我不想再活下去了。_

_Come die with me, sweet daughter"  
来与我同归于尽吧，亲爱的女儿_

_Yes, Mama, this time, I think I'll die with you  
是的，妈妈，这次，我想我会与你同去_

_Come die with me, sweet Asuka'  
与我同归于尽吧，亲爱的明日香_

_Yes, Mama, this time, I think I'll die with you  
是的，妈妈，这次，我想我会与你同去_

_Come die with me, my Asuka'  
与我同归于尽吧，我的明日香_

_Yes, Mama, this time, I think I'll die  
是的，妈妈，这次，我想我会死去_

_With you 与你同在_

From a world outside that of the Child's dreams, a laboratory technician notices the patterns on the Pilot's mental monitor screen.  
来自孩童梦境之外的世界，一位实验室技术员注意到了飞行员精神监测屏幕上的图案。

It was responding to the electric signals in her brain.  
它正在响应她大脑中的电信号。

That line hadn't moved for eight days now, and here it was, jolting up every other 0.6 seconds or so.  
那条线已经八天没有移动了，而现在，它每隔大约 0.6 秒就会猛地跳动一下。

It was something to the effect of a miracle, that needed to be reported immediately.  
这简直是个奇迹，必须立即上报。

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"You're positive that there is brain activity in the Pilot?" asked Ritsuko through the phone.  
“你确定驾驶员的大脑还有活动吗？”律子通过电话问道。

"Yes, Ma'am, most absolutely. The Pilot's mental activity is rising every minute. Her brain is out of comatose. She's alive."  
“是的，女士，绝对没错。领航员的思维活跃度每分钟都在上升。她的大脑已经脱离了昏迷状态。她醒着。”

"Thank you for that," Ritsuko breathed, and hung up. The next order of business was—  
"谢谢你告诉我这些，" 律子轻声说道，随后挂断了电话。接下来要处理的是——

"Let Major Katsuragi know about the Second Child's condition. I suspect she'd want to know about this."  
"通知葛城少校关于二号机驾驶员的状况。我猜她会想知道这件事。"

And so, it was reported to everyone in NERV that a miracle had occurred, somehow, that the pilot of Unit-02 was slowly coming out of her stupor. Misato wasted no time. She informed Shinji at once, and the boy raced out of whichever cave he was hiding in to be at Asuka's side. He felt it important that he be there for her, if for nothing else than the purpose that he could be the first target of her wrath if she woke up.  
于是，NERV 的每个人都得知了一个奇迹般的消息，不知为何，二号机驾驶员正逐渐从昏迷中苏醒。美里毫不耽搁，立刻通知了真嗣，男孩便从他躲藏的任何地方冲出来，赶到明日香身边。他觉得重要的是，如果她醒来，他能在那里陪着她，哪怕只是为了在她醒来时成为她怒火的首个目标。

Sohryu Asuka-Langley opened her eyes to light that seemed to be infinite and was thrust back into the world of the living after two weeks of unconsciousness.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷睁开了双眼，面对着似乎无边无际的光芒，她在昏迷两周后被重新拉回了现实世界。

And when the Third Child saw this, he threw his arms around her in his happiness regardless of whether he knew she would react violently or not.  
当第三适格者看到这一幕时，他欣喜若狂地抱住了她，全然不顾她是否会激烈反应。

She did not react. At all.  
她完全没有反应。

She said only one word. "Cold."  
她只说了一个字。“冷。”

He didn't mind the cold, for once. The light, finally, was shining brightly overhead.  
他这次并不介意寒冷。终于，头顶的光芒明亮地照耀着。

And that was all that mattered to him.  
对他来说，这就足够了。

A/N: I think I've made some things clean-cut and dried. The pairings are pretty clear, I think, and how I established them is the way it will stay. Until further notice, that is. In any case, "The Pantheon" will consist of eighteen or more chapters. If I have any mistakes or errors regarding canon concepts (except for the fact that Nagisa Kaworu is alive here) please leave me a review or an email. Any criticisms, comments, suggestions, and violent reactions will be accepted and appreciated muchly.  
作者注：我想我已经把一些事情处理得干净利落了。配对关系应该相当明确，我设定的方式也将保持不变，至少目前如此。无论如何，“众神殿”将包含十八章或更多。如果我在正典概念上有任何错误或疏漏（除了渚薰在此处存活这一事实外），请给我留言或发邮件。任何批评、评论、建议以及激烈的反应都将被接受并深表感激。

Acknowledgements and thanks to the Otaku Board people for help, lots and lots of help regarding Evangelion nuances and other such things. Wuberly people.  
感谢御宅族论坛的朋友们，在关于《新世纪福音战士》的细微之处及其他相关事宜上给予了我大量的帮助。还有 Wuberly 的朋友们。

[what used to be meemee](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/231402/what-used-to-be-meemee): omg...that was beautiful. i loved the different perspectives of all the different people. esp. asuka's dream with her mamie. and i also loved shinji.  i absolutely love your style of writing, it has such a poetic and symbolic feel. this was a brilliant beginning.
天啊...太美了。我喜欢不同人各自的观点，尤其是明日香和她奶奶的梦。还有我也喜欢真嗣。我完全爱上了你的写作风格，它充满了诗意和象征性。这是一个绝妙的开篇。

charliedoggie: looks like you toned down the more poetic parts of the story and stuck to narrative... not that it's a bad thing though... it still came out rather nicely... especially the "talk" with asuka's mommy...  i'm still wondering how you're gonna pull a rabbit out of rei's and kaworu's "relationship" though... kinda freaks me out imagining the two of them together sometimes... *shudder*  
看起来你减少了故事中更诗意的部分，专注于叙述...不过这并不是坏事...效果依然相当不错...尤其是与明日香妈妈的那段对话...  我还在想你打算怎么从丽和薰的“关系”中变出兔子来...有时候想象他们俩在一起真是让我有点毛骨悚然...*颤抖*
