A/N: I don't even know if I can explain this one. There is no real rhyme or reason for this short little fic other then I felt like writing it. I'm giving it an M rating for the brief talk of rape.
作者的话：我甚至不知道我是否能解释这一篇。这篇短小的同人文并没有真正的韵律或理由，只是我突然想写而已。我给它一个 M 评级，因为其中简短地提到了强奸。

"It's over Asuka!" "结束了，明日香！"

Three little words. 三个字。

I am speechless when I try to define the impact those three little words had on me. I can write down a bunch of words, but let's be honest, It's all meaningless. But I'm told that I need an outlet, that expressing myself will make the pain a little easier to deal with. So here goes nothing.
当我试图描述那三个字对我产生的影响时，我无言以对。我可以写下一大堆词汇，但说实话，这一切都毫无意义。但我被告知我需要一个出口，表达自己会让痛苦更容易处理。所以，一切从零开始。

I feel like my soul has been ripped out of my body.
我感觉自己的灵魂仿佛被从身体中撕扯出来。

I imagine that your reading this, thinking that I am just being melodramatic, over emotional or maybe even being a drama queen. But if you thought that, then you don't know me very well and surely you wouldn't be reading this.
我猜你现在读到这里，可能会认为我只是在夸张，过于情绪化，或者甚至是在小题大做。但如果你这么想，那说明你并不太了解我，当然，你也不会继续读下去。

I honestly feel like my soul is missing. I feel nothing on the inside.
我真的感觉自己的灵魂不见了。内心空无一物。

Maybe this is how my momma felt before she ended her life. Maybe my momma wasn't so crazy after all.
或许这就是我妈妈在结束自己生命前的感觉。也许我妈妈并没有那么疯狂。

I think the worst part is that I don''t even know why he broke up with me.
我觉得最糟糕的是，我甚至不知道他为什么要和我分手。

I know I am not the nicest person around, but he said he was ok with that, he had accepted my faults. So what caused him to stop loving me? Did he finally realize that I have a lot more faults then he originally thought? Maybe the clueless bastard finally figured out that I am a lot more broken then I let anyone know? Maybe he just wants to see me cry. Well I'm sorry Shinji, I have no more tears to give. I ran out of them the first time I caught you cheating.
我知道自己不是周围最善良的人，但他曾说他对此没意见，他已经接受了我的缺点。那是什么让他停止爱我了呢？是他终于意识到我的缺点比他最初认为的要多得多吗？或许这个迟钝的家伙终于明白了我比任何人所知的都要破碎？也许他只是想看我哭泣。好吧，真对不起，真嗣，我已经没有眼泪可以给了。第一次发现你出轨时，我就已经流干了。

Do you remember that Shinji? Do you remember bringing that whore into our bedroom and fucking her on our bed? Do you remember when I dragged her out of our bed and beat the hell out of her? I didn't realize beating her was a mistake, I didn't know that beating you would have prevented you from doing it again. It can not be said that Asuka Langley Soryu doesn't learn from her mistakes... Unless that mistakes name is Shinji.
你还记得那个真嗣吗？你还记得把那个贱人带到我们的卧室，在我们的床上和她鬼混吗？你还记得我怎么把她从我们的床上拖下来，狠狠揍了她一顿吗？我当时没意识到打她是错误的，我不知道打你一顿就能阻止你再犯。不能说明日香·兰格雷·索西尔不从错误中学习...除非那个错误的名字叫真嗣。

I took you back after you cheated on me. Twice.
你背叛我之后，我原谅了你。两次。

Yet here we are, I'm in our house – alone – trying to come to terms with why you stopped loving me, and you? Well... I don't know what your doing. You won't answer my calls. I think your at Toji and Hikari's because she won't answer the phone either. Apparently, taking my soul wasn't enough for you, so you took my best friend away too. You really have turned into a selfish asshole, you know that? I put up with all of your insecurities, infidelities and all of those damn nights you came home three hours late and drunk off your ass.
然而现在，我独自一人在我们的房子里，试图理解你为何不再爱我，而你呢？好吧...我不知道你在做什么。你不接我的电话。我想你是在东治和光那里，因为她也不接电话。显然，夺走我的灵魂对你来说还不够，你还夺走了我最好的朋友。你真的变成了一个自私的混蛋，你知道吗？我忍受了你所有的自卑、不忠，还有那些你深夜醉醺醺回家的时候。

I even forgave you after all of those times you would hit me.
即使在你多次打我之后，我还是原谅了你。

I believed you when you would tell me that you would never hit me again, that it was the alcohol that was making you do it. You would even promise to stop drinking so much. I would look into your dark blue eyes and I would know that your were telling the truth. Even after the fifth, sixth and seventh times. Remember that time I dumped all of your whiskey down the drain? I don't. I barely remember waking up in the hospital. "She fell down the stairs" is what you had told everyone. And they believed it. Hell, even I almost believed it.
当你告诉我你不会再打我，是酒精让你失控时，我信了。你甚至承诺会少喝酒。我会凝视你深蓝色的眼睛，知道你在说真话。即使是在第五次、第六次和第七次之后。记得那次我把你的威士忌全倒进下水道吗？我不记得了。我几乎不记得在医院醒来的情景。你告诉大家我摔下了楼梯。他们都信了。天哪，连我自己都差点信了。

Although, getting hit by you was preferable to when you would hit me and then hold me down and force yourself inside of me. I would beg for you to at least wait until I had a chance to get wet down there. But you never did. It hurt so much, I would cry out in pain with every thrust of your hips, at least until there was enough blood to act as a lubricant.
尽管如此，被你打还是比不上你打我后压着我强行进入我。我会求你至少等我那里湿润一些。但你从未等过。那太痛了，每次你挺腰我都会痛得哭喊，直到流出的血足以充当润滑剂。

I was the one that was home alone all night. I was the one that got hit. I was the one that was laying face down, my arms pinned to the kitchen floor as you raped me. I was the one that had to clean the blood off my battered flower. And yet you were the one who left me. Why did you lea...
那一夜，家中只有我一人。被打的是我。我面朝下趴在厨房地板上，双臂被压住，你侵犯了我。我还要清洗那朵被摧残的花上的血迹。然而，离开的却是你。为什么你要离我而去...

Was as much as Shinji could read. He put the notebook down, pinched his nose and closed his eyes. "You know Asuka, when your shrink suggested you write down your feelings, she meant your feelings about your actual past." Shinji opened his eyes and stared at the goddess seated across from him.
真嗣能读到的就这么多。他放下笔记本，捏了捏鼻梁，闭上了眼睛。“你知道吗，明日香，你的心理医生让你写下感受，是指你对自己真实过去的感受。”真嗣睁开眼，凝视着坐在对面的女神。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "I know that baka! I just want to see her face when she reads that!" Asuka gave Shinji an evil smile.
明日香翻了个白眼。“我知道，笨蛋！我只是想看看她读到这些时的表情！”明日香对真嗣露出了一个邪恶的笑容。

Shinji shook his head. "But Asuka, what if she thinks your serious and has me arrested?"
真嗣摇了摇头。“但是明日香，如果她当真了，把我抓起来怎么办？”

Asuka's smile grew bigger. "Then I wouldn't have to listen to you snore anymore, would I?" Shinji just shook his head. "You know Asuka, you really do scare me sometimes."
明日香的笑容更灿烂了。“那我就不用再听你打呼噜了，对吧？”真嗣只是摇了摇头。“你知道吗，明日香，你有时候真的挺吓人的。”

Asuka stood up and walked over to his chair, sat on his lap, put her arms around his neck and gave him a quick kiss. "That makes me happy to know."
明日香站起身，走到他的椅子旁，坐在他的腿上，双臂环住他的脖子，迅速地吻了他一下。“知道这个让我很开心。”
