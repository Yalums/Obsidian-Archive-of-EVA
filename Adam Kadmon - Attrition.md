Asuka and Misato are more than roommates. They're friends. Wait. I mean mortal enemies.  
明日香和美里不仅仅是室友。她们是朋友。等等。我是说死敌。

"What is that stench?" “那是什么臭味？”

Asuka left her room. It was dinnertime, she was hungry, and she needed to get away from her literature assignment. But the reek saturating the apartment was quickly killing her appetite.  
明日香离开了她的房间。晚饭时间到了，她饿了，而且需要逃离她的文学作业。但公寓里弥漫的恶臭很快让她没了食欲。

"It's supper," Misato called from the kitchen, sounding too cheerful for someone producing the kind of smell she was producing. "Get it before Pen Pen wakes up and steals your share."  
“该吃晚饭了，”美里从厨房喊道，她的声音过于欢快，与她制造的那种气味不相符。“趁 Pen Pen 醒来抢走你的份之前赶紧吃吧。”

Asuka glanced at the bird's refrigerator home as she entered the kitchen. "I think he's hiding out."  
明日香走进厨房时瞥了一眼那只鸟的冰箱窝。“我觉得它躲起来了。”

"Why would he do that? He loves this stuff."  
"他为什么要那样做？他明明喜欢这些东西。"

"God, it smells. What is it?"  
"天啊，这味道。这是什么？"

"Curry over noodles. Good, traditional Katsuragi comfort food."  
"咖喱盖面。正宗的桂木家安慰食物。"

"You mean instant curry over instant noodles."  
"你是说即食咖喱配即食面。"

"Yeah, what I said," Misato replied, looking innocent. "Come on, come on; sit down. It's almost ready."  
"对啊，我说的就是这个，"美里回答，装出一副无辜的样子。"快点，快点；坐下吧。马上就好了。"

Asuka debated hunger and laziness against intestinal trauma. She might get to miss school tomorrow if she ate. She sat.  
明日香在饥饿和懒惰与肠道创伤之间权衡。如果她吃了这顿饭，她可能会错过明天的学校。她坐下了。

She watched Misato at the counter, hopping from foot to foot as she waited for the instant noodle cups to cool. She was wearing her "relaxed" attire, cutoffs and a tank top, which seemed designed more to accentuate what was showing than to actually cover her body.  
她看着美里在柜台前，双脚不停地跳来跳去，等待着速食面杯冷却。她穿着她的“休闲”装束，短裤和背心，似乎更多是为了突出露出的部分，而不是真正为了遮盖身体。

"How does she manage to keep that ugly scar from popping out?" Asuka whispered to herself. She sighed and spoke up. "Do you have to walk around like that?"  
“她是怎么做到不让那条丑陋的伤疤露出来的？”明日香自言自语地低声说道。她叹了口气，提高了声音。“你非得这样走来走去吗？”

"Like what?" Misato glanced over her shoulder.  
“像什么？”美里回头瞥了一眼。

"Wearing those clothes, and I use the term loosely."  
"穿着那些衣服，我这么说已经很客气了。"

"What's wrong with my clothes?" She looked herself over, not without a fair degree of pride.  
"我的衣服怎么了？" 她上下打量自己，不无几分自豪。"

"You're barely wearing anything," Asuka said, pointing. "It's indecent."  
"你几乎没穿什么，" 明日香指着她说。"这太不雅了。"

"You sound like Shinji when he first moved in. You're both such prudes."  
"你说话的口气就像真嗣刚搬进来时一样。你们俩都这么拘谨。"

"Do not compare me to that pervert. It's obvious he likes it. You're just feeding his deviant nature. I'm shocked he hasn't died from excessive nosebleeds."  
"别把我跟他那种变态相提并论。很明显他喜欢这样。你只是在助长他的扭曲本性。我真惊讶他还没因为过度流鼻血而死。"

"Nah, he's used to it by now. And I've seen the short shorts you wear around here, missy. Ah, maybe _you're_ trying to give Shinji a nosebleed."  
"不，他现在早就习惯了。而且我见过你在这里穿的那些超短裤，小姐。啊，也许你是想让真嗣流鼻血吧。"

"He'd be bleeding from more than his nose if he dared look at me like that. And I only wear those because the air conditioner is always on the fritz."  
"如果他敢那样看我，流的就不只是鼻血了。我戴这些只是因为空调老是出问题。"

"Yeah, I need to fix that." Misato gave a tiny squeal of joy as dinner cooled. She ladled a thick curry-like liquid into the two instant noodle cups, then dropped them on the table. "Dig in."  
"是啊，我得修修那个。" 晚餐冷却时，美里发出了一声小小的欢呼。她将一种浓稠的咖喱状液体舀进两个方便面杯里，然后放在桌上。"开动吧。"

"'Dig' is right," Asuka muttered, peering over the cup's lip at what appeared to be curry-colored mud. A sizable bubble broke the lumpy surface with an audible pop. She glanced up to find her guardian happily slurping away, chopsticks in one hand, beer in the other. How did she keep her figure? "There's no justice in this world."  
"‘开动’这个词用得真贴切，" 明日香咕哝着，从杯口望向那团看起来像咖喱色的泥巴。一个不小的气泡打破了那凹凸不平的表面，发出一声清晰的“啵”。她抬头看到她的监护人正开心地吸溜着，一手拿筷子，一手拿啤酒。她是怎么保持身材的？"这世界真没天理。"

"Say what?" "什么？"

"Nothing." Asuka felt the chopsticks strain as she tried to stir whatever was congealing in the cup.  
"没什么。" 明日香感觉到筷子在搅拌杯中凝结物时变得吃力。

"Hey," Misato said with a grin, "want a sip of beer? I promise not to tell." She shook her can at her.  
"嘿，" 美里笑着说，"想喝一口啤酒吗？我保证不告状。" 她向她摇了摇手中的罐子。

Asuka scoffed. "Please. You call that Japanese tap water beer? If I was dying of dehydration I wouldn't let that swill touch my palette."  
明日香嗤之以鼻。“拜托，你管那叫日本自来水啤酒？就算我快渴死了，也不会让那种劣酒沾我的舌头。”

"Don't knock it 'til you try it." She helped herself to a long draw. "Unless you've already sampled my wares."  
“没试过别急着否定。”她自顾自地喝了一大口。“除非你已经尝过我的手艺了。”

"Like I'd allow your slovenly habits to rub off on me."  
“我才不会让你那邋遢的习惯传染给我。”

"Good. A drunken pilot would be a disaster."  
"很好。一个醉酒的飞行员可是灾难。"

"Unlike a drunken operations director?"  
"不像一个醉酒的运营总监？"

"I have faith in my pilot corps."  
"我对我的飞行员队伍有信心。"

"Corps?" Asuka repeated. "As in every pilot? The only one you need to count on is me. The First and Shinji are useless."  
"“军团？”明日香重复道，“你是说每个驾驶员？唯一能指望的只有我。第一和真嗣都是废物。”

The First and Shinji were not useless. Rei was a fine point of comparison for her skill and Shinji had proven an invaluable and unsurpassed warrior in the kitchen. Asuka counted that as the singular redeeming quality justifying Shinji's continued existence. Anything below a specific flavor threshold tasted like LCL, as he was well aware of. To Asuka, Chef Shinji was a master at finding that level and keeping above it. Although with her altered taste buds she couldn't be sure if he was a good cook or just good at masking LCL.  
"第一和真嗣并非一无是处。绫波的技能与她不相上下，而真嗣在厨房中证明了自己是一位无可比拟的战士。明日香认为这是真嗣存在的唯一可取之处。低于特定口味阈值的食物对她来说都像 LCL，真嗣对此心知肚明。对明日香而言，厨师真嗣擅长找到那个水平并保持在其之上。尽管她的味觉发生了变化，她无法确定真嗣是个好厨师还是仅仅擅长掩盖 LCL 的味道。

But Misato's criminal reimagining of curry was beyond the threshold of what a normal human should ingest. This was the fate Shinji left her to in order to pursue the selfish desire to have friends.  
"但美里对咖喱的犯罪性重塑已经超出了正常人应摄入的极限。这是真嗣为了追求自私的交友愿望而留给她的命运。”

"I can't believe stupid Shinji is spending the night at his stupid friend's house. It's so juvenile."  
"真不敢相信那个笨蛋真嗣居然要在他那笨蛋朋友家过夜。真是幼稚极了。"

Misato discreetly rolled her eyes. "What are you talking about? You stay over at that Horaki girl's place all the time."  
美里悄悄翻了个白眼。“你在说什么呢？你不是经常在那个洞木女孩家过夜吗。”

"It's different for girls," Asuka stated. "You had friends when you were my age, didn't you?"  
“对女生来说不一样，”明日香断言道。“你在我这个年纪也有朋友吧，不是吗？”

"Let's drop it, alright?"  
"我们别提这事了，好吗？"

"Touchy-touchy. What's wrong? Was party-girl Misato not popular in school? Maybe you were lonely? You get the silent treatment and everything?"  
"敏感易怒啊。怎么了？派对女孩美里在学校不受欢迎吗？或许你很孤独？被冷落了，是吗？"

"I said _drop it_." "我说了，别再提了。"

Misato frowned, tapping her chopsticks on the cup's lip. Asuka snorted. She took a tentative bite of what Misato charitably called dinner. She gagged. Shinji leaving her to this punishment was indefensible.  
美里皱起眉头，用筷子轻敲杯口。明日香嗤之以鼻。她小心翼翼地咬了一口美里勉强称之为晚餐的东西。她差点吐出来。真嗣让她受这种罪，真是不可原谅。

"There will be a penalty for this," she muttered. "But if stupid Shinji likes it so much over at his dumb friend's house he should stay there." Her brow furrowed. "Why is he even living here?" Asuka wondered aloud. "Why doesn't he live with that delightful father of his?"  
“这会有惩罚的，”她低声说，“但如果真嗣那么喜欢他那蠢朋友的家，就让他待在那儿好了。”她的眉头紧锁。“他为什么住在这里？”明日香大声问道，“为什么不和他那讨人喜欢的父亲住在一起？”

Misato nursed her beer. 美里慢慢喝着啤酒。

"I mean, I can't ask _him,_" Asuka went on. "You know how sensitive he is. I'd never get a straight answer."  
"我的意思是，我不能直接问他，" 明日香继续说。"你知道他有多敏感。我永远得不到一个直截了当的答案。"

"Aw, are you afraid of hurting Shinji's feelings? How sweet of you."  
"哎呀，你怕伤了真嗣的心吗？你真是太体贴了。"

"Bite me." "咬我吧。"

Misato shrugged. "You'll have to ask him if you want an answer."  
美里耸了耸肩。“如果你想得到答案，就得去问他本人。”

"I just said—" “我刚刚说了——”

"I meant you'd have to ask the Commander."  
“我的意思是，你得去问司令。”

She would not be asking the Commander. Asuka went back to clinically examining the noodle cup.  
她不会去问指挥官。明日香继续冷静地检查着泡面杯。

"Not hungry?" Misato asked.  
“不饿吗？”美里问道。

After the first tentative bite Asuka had done nothing but poke at her meal. "Not for this." She frowned. "I'm sure Shinji's idiot friends are enjoying his cooking right now."  
在试探性地咬了一口后，明日香只是拨弄着她的食物。“不是因为饿。”她皱眉道，“我敢肯定，真嗣那帮笨蛋朋友现在正享受着他的厨艺呢。”

"Well, don't blame me if you starve."  
"好吧，要是你饿肚子，可别怪我。"

"This is all his fault," Asuka said. "He should have remembered to make us dinner before he left. It's not like this was some critical emergency or anything. It's just dumb boys doing dumb stuff together."  
"这都是他的错，"明日香说。"他本该记得在我们离开前做好晚饭的。又不是什么紧急情况，不过是些傻男孩在一起做傻事罢了。"

"I think he deserves a night off," Misato said as she worked through the sludge of her meal. "You know, I had to cook for myself every night before he moved in. It's not so bad."  
"我觉得他今晚应该休息一下，"美里一边吃着糊状的食物一边说。"你知道的，他搬进来之前，我每晚都得自己做饭。其实也没那么糟糕。"

"'Cook', you say. Shinji told me all you had in here was this instant crap and snacks."  
“‘厨师’，你说。真嗣告诉我你这里只有这些速食垃圾和零食。”

"My little Shinji is talking about me behind my back? And spreading vicious lies?" She saw Asuka was not buying. "So I was busy. I have a fairly hectic job, as you may recall."  
“我的小真嗣在背后说我坏话？还散布恶毒的谎言？”她看到明日香并不相信。“所以我当时很忙。你可能记得，我的工作相当繁忙。”

"Uh huh. Hectic. Now, refresh my memory. Was this before or after the Angels started attacking?"  
“嗯哼。繁忙。现在，帮我回忆一下。这是在使徒开始袭击之前还是之后？”

"Being Operations Director is hectic even on days when we aren't being invaded by giant monsters. The paperwork I have to go through would kill a lesser woman."  
"即便是没有巨型怪兽入侵的日子，担任运营总监也忙得不可开交。我得处理的那些文件，足以让一个普通人崩溃。"

"As opposed to my job, which literally would kill a lesser woman." Asuka glared at her. "What? What was that little snicker just now? You don't think I'm in danger every time I fight?"  
"相比之下，我的工作可是真的会要了人的命。"" 明日香瞪着她。""什么？你刚才那声轻笑是什么意思？你难道不觉得每次战斗我都很危险吗？"

"No, no, it's not that. I know you are."  
"不，不是那样的。我知道你的处境。"

"Then what was—" "那之前是什么—"

"Come on, Asuka. Kaji isn't around. You don't have to call yourself a woman." Misato knew as soon as she explained it she shouldn't have explained it. In hindsight the three beers before dinner might not have been a good idea.  
"拜托，明日香。加持不在。你不必非得称自己为女人。" 美里一解释完就意识到自己不该解释。事后看来，晚饭前喝的那三杯啤酒可能不是个好主意。

"Well, I guess if you define being a woman as a lazy, addle-brained, borderline-alcoholic then, no, I'm not a woman. Are you?"  
"好吧，如果把做女人定义为懒惰、头脑混乱、近乎酗酒的话，那么，不，我不是女人。你是吗？"

"I'm at a good place with my alcoholism," Misato said, finishing off her can. "And lazy I'll let slide. But addle-brained? Girl, I am a master tactician. My brain is always on."  
"我对我的酗酒问题处理得很好，" 美里喝完她的罐装饮料说道，"懒惰我可以放过，但头脑糊涂？姑娘，我可是战术大师。我的大脑时刻在线。"

"If this is on then I'd hate to see it turned off." Asuka stared her down, waiting for a fight. Misato went back to her meal with sharp, deliberate motions. "How can you shovel this stuff into your face? It's disgusting."  
"如果这是开着的，那我真不敢想象它关掉的样子。" 明日香盯着她，等待一场争执。美里用尖锐、刻意的动作继续她的晚餐。"你怎么能把这些东西塞进嘴里？太恶心了。"

"You've been harping on my cooking all night. Give it a rest."  
"你整晚都在挑剔我的厨艺。消停会儿吧。"

"You're my guardian. You're responsible for providing me a decent meal. At least something edible."  
"你是我的守护者。你有责任给我提供一顿像样的饭，至少得是能吃的。"

"I made dinner. You don't like it? Make something yourself."  
"我做了晚饭。不喜欢？你自己做去。"

"That's stupid Shinji's job."  
"那是愚蠢的真嗣的工作。"

"Well then," Misato said, dropping her utensils. "Maybe I should hop in the car and drag him back here to cater to your discriminating culinary whims. How dare he have friends. I'll just have to punish him for taking a night off from being your personal slave."  
"那么，" 美里放下餐具说道，"或许我该开车去把他拽回来，满足你那挑剔的烹饪要求。他怎么敢有朋友。我得惩罚他，因为他居然敢休息一晚，不再做你的私人奴隶。"

"Punish," Asuka repeated evenly. "Just like you punished him after the last battle? With a teary hug?"  
"惩罚，" 明日香平静地重复道，"就像上次战斗后你对他做的那样？用一个泪流满面的拥抱？"

"I…" Misato was caught off-guard. "I thought he was—" She let a sharp sigh out through her teeth. "I thought he wasn't coming back from that shadow," she said carefully. "I would have done the same if it was you."  
"我…" 美里措手不及，"我以为他——" 她咬牙切齿地叹了口气，"我以为他无法从那阴影中走出来，" 她小心翼翼地说，"如果是你，我也会做同样的事。"

"Yeah, right." "是啊，没错。"

"I mean it, Asuka." "我是认真的，明日香。"

She scoffed. "Like you did after I nearly bought it in that volcano? Gee, thanks. Great to know you care so much."  
她嗤之以鼻。\"就像那次我在火山里差点没命后你的表现？哎呀，谢谢了。真高兴知道你这么在乎。\"

Misato clenched her jaw. "I might not have been…" She rubbed her eyes. "I was… After the last battle, not being able to do anything, seeing what Unit 01 did, I… Look, I wasn't thinking as clearly as I maybe should have been when he came back."  
美里咬紧牙关。“我可能没有……”她揉了揉眼睛。“我当时……在最后一战后，什么都做不了，看着初号机所做的一切，我……听着，他回来时，我的思维可能没有应该的那么清晰。”

"That seems to happen a lot with him."  
“他似乎经常这样。”

"I did chew him out later. After he showered. You just didn't see it."  
“后来我确实训了他一顿。在他洗完澡之后。只是你没看到。”

"So disobeying orders, acting arbitrarily and endangering an Eva gets a private finger-wagging? All that isn't enough for a proper dressing-down? He screwed up again and you let him off the hook. Again."  
“不服从命令，擅自行动，危及 EVA，就只得到私下里的指指点点？这些都不足以让他受到应有的训斥吗？他又搞砸了，你却再次放过了他。”

Misato's fists went white under the table. "Sometimes a soft touch is more—"  
“有时候，温和的手段更能——”美里在桌下的拳头攥得发白。

"No," Asuka cut her off. "This is _exactly_ what I'm talking about. You _always_ take his side. No matter what he does, or doesn't do, you make excuses for him to keep failing. It's as much your fault for not disciplining him as it is his own blinding incompetence."  
“不，”明日香打断她，“我说的就是这个。你总是站在他那边。无论他做了什么，或没做什么，你都为他找借口，让他继续失败。你不严格管教他，和他自己的无能一样，都是你的错。”

"Well, I'm so, _so_ sorry we can't all be as perfect as you. Except last time I checked you were running _second_ to Shinji's kill count. And I suppose you forgot who ranked first in the last synch test."  
"好吧，我非常非常抱歉我们不能都像你一样完美。不过上次我记得你击杀数排在真嗣后面。而且我想你忘了上次同步测试谁排第一了吧。"

"There you go again, defending your favorite pilot."  
"你又来了，总是维护你最喜欢的驾驶员。"

"It's facts, Asuka. How many Angels have you killed by yourself? Without any assistance?" Misato leaned forward. "How many have you killed without Shinji bailing you out?"  
"这是事实，明日香。你自己独立击杀了多少使徒？没有得到任何帮助的情况下？" 美里向前倾身。"没有真嗣救场，你又击杀了多少？"

"He never 'bailed me out,'" Asuka said tightly.  
"他从未‘救我于水火’，"明日香紧绷地说道。

"Really? I've seen the flight recorder from Unit 02's maiden battle. How Shinji had to take the controls while you were having a little meltdown. I'd say it was cute if the fate of the world hadn't been hanging in the balance."  
"真的吗？我看过二号机首战的飞行记录仪。当时真嗣不得不接管控制，而你却在经历那所谓的‘小崩溃’。如果不是世界命运悬而未决，我真会觉得那很可爱。

"What you call my 'little meltdown' was me wondering where my tactical support was. What were you doing up on the bridge? Desperately trying to find Mr. Kaji to boost your pathetic ego again?"  
"你所谓的‘小崩溃’，只是我在疑惑我的战术支援在哪里。你那时在舰桥上做什么？又在拼命寻找加持先生来再次提升你那可悲的自尊吗？

"Don't take it out on me because you're jealous of Shinji."  
"别因为嫉妒真嗣就把气撒在我身上。"

"I am _not_ jealous of him," Asuka bit out. "I am not jealous of the way everyone favors him, makes excuses for him, promotes him, and gives him the extra support he did nothing to earn. None of that makes me jealous. It makes me disgusted. It's the only reason he's had any success. You all go out of your way to coddle him."  
"我不是嫉妒他，" 明日香咬牙切齿地说。"我不是嫉妒大家都偏袒他，为他找借口，提拔他，给他额外的支持，而他什么都没做就得到了这些。这些都不会让我嫉妒。这只会让我感到恶心。他能有任何成就，全是因为你们所有人都刻意宠着他。"

"We're reacting to the situation as needed," Misato began tersely. "Don't—"  
"我们是在根据情况采取必要的行动，" 美里开始生硬地说道。"别——"

"Oh, please. Right from the start you've led the Shinji love parade. And this apartment is where it begins." She turned her head. "I don't know why I ever agreed to live here!"  
"哦，拜托。从一开始你就领着对真嗣的爱慕游行。而这个公寓就是起点。" 她转过头。"我不知道我为什么会同意住在这里！"

Misato studied her for a moment and frowned. "I can have the paperwork by the morning. If you hate it here so much I won't force you to stay."  
美里审视了她一会儿，皱起眉头。"我可以在早上之前拿到文件。如果你这么讨厌这里，我不会强迫你留下。"

"Oh, you'd love it if I left, wouldn't you?" Asuka sniped. "Then you could spend all your time fawning over Shinji. You could turn my room into a shrine and worship him when he's not home. What a perfect arrangement."  
"哦，你肯定巴不得我走，对吧？" 明日香反唇相讥。"那样你就可以把所有时间都花在真嗣身上。你可以把我的房间变成神龛，在他不在家的时候膜拜他。多么完美的安排。"

"Maybe I should fawn over you instead?"  
"或许我应该讨好你才对？"

"So you admit it! You _do_ give him special treatment!"  
"所以你承认了！你确实对他特别关照！"

"He never had your training," Misato stated.  
"他从未接受过你的训练，" 美里说道。"

"That's not my problem. You and NERV are the geniuses that decided that. I shouldn't be penalized for your oversight." She sat back and crossed her arms. "And I don't want anyone fawning over me. I don't need it. I'm not doing this to get daddy's approval."  
“那不是我的问题。你和 NERV 才是决定这一切的天才。我不应该因为你们的疏忽而受罚。”她向后靠了靠，交叉双臂。“我也不希望有人对我过分关心。我不需要。我这么做不是为了得到父亲的认可。”

"_Shut your mouth!"_ Misato snapped. She stabbed a finger at her. "Don't you _dare_ think you know _anything_ about me!"  
“闭嘴！”美里厉声喝道。她用手指狠狠地指向她。“你胆敢认为自己了解我什么！”

Asuka watched her for a long moment. "I was talking about Shinji," she said evenly. "No wonder you like him so much." She rose and carefully pushed her chair under the table. "I really shouldn't get in the way of your special little connection, since it seems you understand each other so well. It's only natural you'd favor him. The weak are drawn to the weak."  
绫波看了她好一会儿。“我是在说真嗣，”她平静地说。“难怪你这么喜欢他。”她站起身，小心地将椅子推回桌下。“我真的不应该妨碍你们那特别的小联系，既然你们彼此理解得这么透彻。偏爱弱者是理所当然的。弱者总是相互吸引。”

Misato watched her return to her room, sliding the door shut without another word. She held her head in her hands, rubbing her eyes with her palms.  
美里看着她回到自己的房间，默默地拉上门。她双手抱头，用掌心揉着眼睛。

"Damn it." She reached blindly for her beer and found it empty. She crushed it and flung it to the floor. "Way to go," she told herself. "Misato, master tactician, loses to a teenager." She stared at Asuka's shut door. "Damn it."  
“该死。”她盲目地伸手去拿啤酒，却发现已经空了。她把空罐捏扁，扔到地上。“干得好，”她自言自语道，“美里，战术大师，输给了一个青少年。”她盯着明日香紧闭的房门。“该死。”

She stood, retrieved the beer can to drop it in the recycling bin, and walked to the stove. She found one of Shinji's cook books, a heavy alien tome filled with strange, impossible formulas. Misato tried to recall Asuka's favorite dish and failed.  
她站起身，捡起啤酒罐扔进回收箱，然后走向炉子。她找到了一本真嗣的烹饪书，一本厚重的外星巨著，里面充满了奇怪、不可能的配方。美里试图回忆明日香最喜欢的菜肴，却失败了。

"It's not like she's a finicky eater," she muttered. "She devours anything Shinji makes. Even if she does complain about it." She recalled her asking for _hanbagu_ last week and settled on that. "Damn that's a lot of prep work. Maybe I should call Shinji?" She dismissed the idea. Nothing good would come from dragging him physically into this squabble.  
"她不是个挑食的人，"她喃喃自语。"她什么都吃，只要是真嗣做的。尽管她总是抱怨。"她想起上周她还点名要汉堡肉，于是决定做这个。"该死，准备工作真多。也许我该给真嗣打电话？"她打消了这个念头。把他卷进这场争执里不会有好结果。

Misato began rummaging through the refrigerator with one hand, balancing the cookbook in the other. She collected ingredients in the crook of her arm and returned to the counter, dumping them in a cluttered pile.  
美里一只手在冰箱里翻找，另一只手拿着食谱保持平衡。她把食材夹在臂弯里，回到料理台前，将它们一股脑儿倒在杂乱的一堆里。

"Like this is going to fix things," she murmured. She stared down at what she collected. "Have to start somewhere." Misato sighed through a smile. "I really hate cooking. I hope this'll be worth it." She glanced over her shoulder towards Asuka's closed door. "I think it will be."  
"这样做就能解决问题吗，"她低声自语。她低头看着自己收集的食材。"总得有个开始。"美里带着微笑叹了口气。"我真的很讨厌做饭。希望这一切是值得的。"她回头瞥了一眼明日香紧闭的房门。"我想会是值得的。"

Author notes: Maybe Misato should have made something terrible with corn, to match how terrible and corny the ending was.  
作者笔记：或许美里应该用玉米做些糟糕的东西，来匹配这个糟糕又俗套的结局。

Meh. A short attempt to examine Asuka and Misato's relationship post-Leliel. I figured Asuka had to hold a grudge as the series went on, especially as things went down the crapper. How many times did Shinji get special treatment or disobey orders without being disciplined? It's got to be a bitter pill to swallow.  
一般般。这是一次尝试探讨明日香和美里在雷里尔事件后的关系。我想随着系列的发展，明日香肯定会有怨气，尤其是当事情变得越来越糟时。真嗣有多少次得到特殊待遇或违抗命令而未受惩罚？这肯定是一颗难以咽下的苦果。

OMAKE by Sideris 外传 作者：Sideris

"Why doesn't he live with Gendo?"  
“他为什么不和源堂住在一起？”

"We get hammered," Misato said. "Constantly."  
“我们经常喝得烂醉，”美里说，“总是这样。”

"Oh-oh my God, you _drink_ with that little sleazebag?"  
"哦，我的天，你居然和那个小混混喝酒？"

"No, just hours and hours of hormonally driven, 'I'm-his-guardian-man-this-is-forbidden' awesome sex."  
"不，只是数小时充满荷尔蒙的，‘我是他的监护人，这可是禁忌之恋’的绝妙性爱。"

### Comment
[Blitzstrahl](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3710266/Blitzstrahl): Was Asuka ever disciplined for ignoring orders with the first sortie against the dance-off angle? Nope! Shinji gets a face slap the very first time he ignored orders against penis-iel. Asuka does the exact same thing four episodes later and nothing happens from Misato.  
在第一次迎战舞会角度使徒时，明日香有没有因为无视命令而受到处分？没有！真嗣第一次无视命令对抗阴茎使徒时就被扇了一巴掌。明日香在四集后做了完全相同的事情，而美里却什么都没做。

MADMAN:
This fic was great, it really shows why the two ended up hating each other. Misato never reach out to asuka like she did girlie boy. She give him a hug when he get eaten alive yet when asuka get mind rape you nowhere to be fond? She throws in her face how the loser had to help her yet forgot if it was not for asuka or rei that shinji sorry ass would not have made it to EOE. Which make all these dumb ass shinji fans who go around calling him a badass look stupid. At one point gendo praise him for taken out a angel forgetting that it took all three of them to defeat that one angel. It really sad how asuka, rei or misato get no respect for being the real badasses they really are, yet the worst pilot of the three get praise like the second coming?  
这篇同人文很棒，它真正展示了两人为何会互相憎恨。美里从未像对待小男孩那样向明日香伸出援手。当真嗣被彻底击垮时，她给了他一个拥抱，然而当明日香遭受心灵强暴时，你却无处可寻？她把失败者不得不帮助她的事甩在明日香脸上，却忘了如果不是明日香或绫波，真嗣那可怜的屁股根本不可能撑到《真心为你》。这让那些四处称他为硬汉的愚蠢真嗣粉丝看起来很可笑。在某一刻，碇源堂称赞他击败了一个使徒，却忘了是三人合力才打败了那个使徒。真的很可悲，明日香、绫波或美里作为真正的硬汉却得不到尊重，而这三人中最差的驾驶员却像救世主一样受到赞扬？  
  
Him being cuddle all the time is no wonder he turn out so bad like he did in EOE. If you don't tell him the truth or show him a bit of tough love then he will never learn anything or grow up. Which is why I have no problem the way shinji is being treated in the third rebuild movie. You can't hug or kiss him after killing half the people on earth for his own selfish needs. The kid has gotten away whit too much for too long.  
他总是被拥抱，难怪在《EOE》中变得那么糟糕。如果你不告诉他真相或对他稍微严厉一点，他就永远不会学习或成长。这就是为什么我对第三部重制电影中对待真嗣的方式没有意见。在他为了自己的自私需求而杀死地球上一半的人之后，你不能再去拥抱或亲吻他。这孩子已经逃避了太久，得到了太多宽容。

Coldwire: That was brilliant, really could have seen that happening on canon. And I do agree with your point of view about Shinji being spoiled by Misato over Asuka.  
真是精彩，确实能想象这在原作中发生。我也同意你对真嗣被美里宠坏而忽视明日香的看法。

I was surprised to read in the notes that this was supposed to bash MISATO after your pristine, very IC rendition of the cruelty Asuka shows towards her unfortunate roommates.  
我在注释中惊讶地读到，这本应是对美里进行抨击的，而你却以极其符合角色性格的方式描绘了明日香对不幸室友的残忍。  
  
It's true that Misato has a better connection to Shinji because she simply understands him better, but she never favored him or anything - I mean, he practically has "please hug me" written on his forehead/ LOOKS as damaged and sensistive as he actually is, while Asuka, on the other hand, completely rejects any attempts to help her and outwardly appeared to be a bit haughthy, but mostly normal untill stuff got REALLY BAD. Misato and Shinji TRIED/did the best they could do within their own limitations, but even a professional shrink would have trouble fixing her. - Misato just fell for Asuka's facade like everyone else did and didn't notice anything was seriously wrong before the batchroom breakdown in ep 22 (At which point Asuka shouted that she hated Misato and wouldn't accept her as a source of help or understanding) Misato DID try to "raise" Asuka, (i.e, teaching her about teamwork and trying to combat what she mistook for ordinary arrogance.)  
确实，美里与真嗣的关系更紧密，因为她更理解他，但她从未偏袒过他或任何事——我的意思是，他几乎在额头上写着“请抱抱我”/看起来就像他实际上那样脆弱和敏感，而另一方面，明日香完全拒绝任何帮助的尝试，表面上显得有些高傲，但大部分时间还算正常，直到事情变得非常糟糕。美里和真嗣在他们自己的局限内尽力而为，但即使是专业的心理医生也会对她感到棘手。——美里就像其他人一样被明日香的假象所迷惑，直到第 22 集浴室崩溃事件之前（当时明日香大喊她恨美里，不会接受她作为帮助或理解的来源）美里确实尝试“培养”明日香，（即，教她团队合作并试图纠正她误以为的普通傲慢。）

Wah-wah-wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ah, the joys of 1AM humor. I'm glad you went with it and used it for omake.
Ho ho ho, oh, Misato, always making those painful Freudian slips when drunk. Daddy left far too large a scar on your mind. FAR too large. I love a good tense argument from this series, canon or fanfic. Such cattiness from the girls. Ah, well, to be expected from those prime Dr. Phil candidates. Misato's tactic of half-assedly answering Asuka's litany of (legitimate) grievances was a nice touch.  
呵呵呵，哦，美里，每次喝醉了总是会说出那些痛苦的弗洛伊德式失言。父亲在你心中留下的伤痕实在太大了。实在太大了。我喜欢这部系列中紧张的争论，无论是原作还是同人。这些女孩间的刻薄真是精彩。唉，对于那些典型的菲尔博士节目候选人来说，这也在意料之中。美里半吊子地回应明日香一连串（合理的）抱怨，这一招真是巧妙。  
  
She did and didn't answer her, and it just goes further to prove that no one in this damned universe can communicate clearly with one another until the world ends. Again.  
她既回答了又没回答，这进一步证明了在这个该死的宇宙中，没有人能在世界再次终结之前清晰地相互沟通。  
  
I like it, but I do see where you were unsatisfied with the ending. It's a sudden thing, but you wracked your brain enough. Like I said: when it's over, it's over. You did just fine, man. The dialogue heaviness of it did a lot to elevate it. Why describe an apartment we all know yet again? Why take away with extraneous detail on what is primarily a character piece? You excelled here.  
我喜欢这个故事，但我确实理解你对结局的不满。虽然突兀，但你已经绞尽脑汁了。就像我说的：结束了就是结束了。你做得很好，伙计。对话的密集度大大提升了故事的质感。为什么还要再次描述我们都熟悉的公寓呢？为什么要用多余的细节来分散对主要角色作品的注意力呢？你在这里做得非常出色。  
  
Asuka's tone and the way you've carried her along here is something I'm really jiving with. It's plain good, is what it is. Cheers on that. So few people write her well nowadays.  
明日香的态度和你在这里对她的处理方式，我真的很喜欢。就是这么好，没别的。为此干杯。如今很少有人能把她写得这么好了。  
  
On the whole, I heartily enjoyed it. MOAR, I say! Well, I know what you're writing currently, so all I can do is patiently wait and harumph in e-mails. :P Great work, my friend. Cheers!  
总的来说，我非常享受。我要更多！好吧，我知道你目前在写什么，所以我只能耐心等待并在邮件中哼哼唧唧了。：P 干得漂亮，我的朋友。干杯！
