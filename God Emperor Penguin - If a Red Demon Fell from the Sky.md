_When a Demon Falls from the Sky  
当恶魔从天而降  
_

---

"Due to the present state of emergency, all phone lines are currently disabled. Please seek the nearest shelter-" _Thud_.  
“由于目前处于紧急状态，所有电话线路已暂时停用。请前往最近的避难所——”砰。

Ikari Shinji let out a sigh.  
碇真嗣发出了一声叹息。

"So much for that plan..." Shinji muttered to himself.  
“计划也就这样了……”真嗣自言自语道。

Tokyo-3 has been called many things: the '_Shining Jewel of Humanity_', '_Bastion of Hope_', '_Bulwark of Mankind_'. But after three hours since last seeing another living soul, Shinji thought of another epithet for the Eternal City of Technology - '_Largest-City-on-Earth-But-Really-It's-Pretty-Empty_ '. Okay, Shinji is not very clever with names.  
第三新东京市被赋予了许多称号：‘人类的光辉宝石’、‘希望的堡垒’、‘人类的屏障’。但在三个小时未见任何活人之后，真嗣为这座永恒的科技之城想出了另一个别称——‘地球上最大的城市，但实际上相当空旷’。好吧，真嗣在起名方面并不怎么聪明。

Taking care to walk around an innocent can an otherwise normal teenager would have kicked down the deserted streets, Shinji sat on a bus bench. With public transit ceasing all operations, phone services disabled and not a soul in sight, Shinji was a bit lost at what to do.  
小心翼翼地绕过一个无辜的易拉罐，这本是普通少年会在废弃街道上踢飞的东西，真嗣坐在公交车站的长椅上。随着公共交通全面停运，电话服务中断，四周空无一人，真嗣有些不知所措。

After arriving, he did not find the lack of people disturbing. Rather, it was inconvenient. After all, when he tried to get enter a nearby community shelter to ask for directions, the power-drunk volunteer shelter leader demanded bribes and tits. Neither of which Shinji had to offer.  
到达后，他并不觉得人迹罕至令人不安，只是感到不便。毕竟，当他试图进入附近的一个社区避难所询问方向时，那个权力膨胀的志愿者避难所负责人索要贿赂和好处，而这两样真嗣都无法提供。

"I could... " Shinji wondered to himself aloud as he surveyed the area. "...just run away..."  
“我或许可以……”真嗣环顾四周，自言自语道，“……就这样逃跑……”

Around him he saw nothing that could help his situation. A flock of doves taking flight from the power lines. The traffic lights flickered yellow heralding caution. A cute blue-haired girl down the middle of the street distorted by the heat haze...  
周围没有任何能帮助他摆脱困境的东西。一群鸽子从电线起飞。交通灯闪烁着黄色，预示着警告。街道中央，一位可爱的蓝发女孩在热浪中显得扭曲……

Wait.

Cute blue-haired girl? 可爱的蓝发女孩？

"H-hey!" Shinji shouted as he ran towards the figure in the middle of the empty street.  
“喂——！”真嗣边喊边跑向空旷街道中央的身影。

And in a blink of an eye, she was gone.  
眨眼间，她便消失了。

"Oh... must have been my imagination," Shinji told himself as he stood where the girl should be. "She did look a bit like mother..."  
“哦……一定是我的幻觉，”真嗣站在本该是女孩所在的位置，自言自语道，“她确实有点像妈妈……”

Sighing for the seventeenth time this past hour, Shinji withdrew a photo from his pocket. The image showed a woman at the beach in loose fitting clothes with an ample demonstration of superior cleavage. Over the top of the photo was the title '_image for reference! Misato!_' with a smaller note and arrow pointed towards her chest that read '_important assets to note!_'  
真嗣在一个小时内第十七次叹气，从口袋里掏出一张照片。照片上是一位在海滩上的女子，穿着宽松的衣服，胸前展现出傲人的曲线。照片上方写着标题‘参考图像！美里！’，旁边还有一个小注释和箭头指向她的胸部，上面写着‘重要资产注意！’

Shinji tilted his head at the picture and remembered why he was here in the first place.  
真嗣对着照片歪了歪头，回忆起自己最初为何来到这里。

After nearly three years of silence between himself and his father, Ikari Gendo, Shinji received a simple command: _come immediately to Tokyo-3. I have a use for you_.  
在与父亲碇源堂近三年的沉默之后，真嗣收到了一个简单的命令：立即前往第三新东京市。我有用得着你的地方。

It was a bit embarrassing to describe the emotions Shinji felt as he read it. A mixture of anger and anguish of the first words from his sole living parent being orders. Yet, there was a slight tinge of happiness. At least his father wanted to meet him. At least his father wanted to see him. At least his father... wanted... him.  
描述真嗣读信时的情感有些尴尬。愤怒与痛苦交织，唯一在世的父亲发来的第一句话竟是命令。然而，其中又夹杂着一丝微弱的喜悦。至少他的父亲想见他。至少他的父亲想见到他。至少他的父亲……需要……他。

Shinji closed his eyes and sighed for the eighteenth time this hour, before he felt the warm rays of the sun cease shining on his head.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，在这个小时内第十八次叹息，随后他感觉到温暖的阳光不再照耀在他的头上。

Shade. 阴影。

Huh? Was it a cloud? Shinji looked up.  
嗯？是云吗？真嗣抬头望去。

"Hey! Watch out! Get out of the way-"  
"嘿！小心！快让开——"

And saw a pair of white panties as they collided with his face.  
然后看见一条白色内裤迎面砸在了他的脸上。

"Umphf! Watch where you're standing, dork! Goddamn. Are you an idiot or something?" Shinji attempted to muster a retort.  
"哼！看着点你站的地方，笨蛋！该死。你是傻子还是怎么的？" 真嗣试图回嘴。

"Get... off-air!" Shinji begged from beneath Asuka's panties.  
"下来... 别压着了！" 真嗣在明日香的短裤下哀求道。

"Gah! _Pervert_! Sexual deviant! Disgusting degenerate!" A female's voice screamed at him as she leaped off him. Shinji breathed a sigh of relief as his oxygen crisis was resolved. Struggling to get himself to his feet, Shinji felt through a sheet of plastic and cloth wrapped around him.  
"啊！变态！色狼！恶心的败类！" 一个女声尖叫着从他身上跳开。真嗣深吸一口气，终于缓解了缺氧的危机。他挣扎着站起来，感觉到一层塑料和布料缠绕在身上。

"Mind getting out of my parachute now?" the fiery girl snapped.  
"现在能从我的降落伞里出来了吗？" 那位火辣的女孩厉声说道。

Shinji stood speechless as he looked up at her. The girl was a goddess to the normal plebeians that walked this earth. Flowing strawberry blonde hair with a pair of exotic clips on either side of her head. Blue eyes that were reeked of anger. And wearing a rather adorable Catholic schoolgirl uniform complete with tie and green-red plaid skirt.  
真嗣站在那里，无言地抬头望着她。这位少女对于行走在这片大地上的普通平民来说，宛如女神一般。她拥有一头飘逸的草莓金发，两侧头饰着一对异国情调的发夹。蓝色的眼睛中充满了怒气。她身着一套相当可爱的天主教学校女生制服，配有领带和红绿格子裙。

"Beautiful..." Shinji whispered to himself.  
“真美……”真嗣自言自语地低声说道。

Much to the horror of the girl.  
这让女孩感到极度惊恐。

_Slap_!

"What did you say? _Beautiful_? Sicko pervert deviant. I'll see it you're added to the sex-offender registry with a shock collar attached to your ankles for the rest of your miserable life!" The girl was now covering herself with her arms as though Shinji was eagerly undressing her with his eyes.  
"你说什么？美丽？变态色狼。我要让你被登记在性犯罪者名单上，脚踝上戴着电击项圈，度过你悲惨的余生！" 女孩现在用双臂遮住自己，仿佛真嗣正用目光贪婪地剥去她的衣服。

"What? No-no! Sorry. I mean-What I meant was... sorry- never mind... parachute...?" Shinji held up the plastic sheet with one hand and his cheek in the other.  
"什么？不不！对不起。我的意思是...抱歉-算了...降落伞...？" 真嗣一手举着塑料布，另一手捂着脸颊。

The girl narrowed her eyes. "Don't apologize," she said as she tossed back her hair. "I shouldn't have gotten so angry. It was rather ungraceful to be so bothered by the universal truth that I am God's greatest gift to humankind. So naturally I'm beautiful," she finished with a smirk.  
女孩眯起眼睛。"别道歉，"她说着，甩了甩头发。"我不该那么生气。因为人类普遍真理——我是上帝赐予人类最伟大的礼物——而如此失态，实在不够优雅。所以我自然很美，"她带着一丝得意的笑容结束了话语。

That's a not so big of a stretch, Shinji thought silently to himself.  
这也不算太离谱，真嗣默默地想。

"What were you doing parachuting in like that?"  
你这样跳伞进来是干什么？

The girl's rage had nearly subsided. It was now replaced with an irritated mood and she began explaining in an annoyed tone. "The city's suppose to be in a state of emergency and everyone to the shelters. I can parachute in where I want. Not like I was expecting _someone to be standing in the middle of the street_," she snapped.  
女孩的怒气已近平息，取而代之的是一种烦躁的情绪。她开始用不耐烦的语气解释道：“城市正处于紧急状态，所有人都应该去避难所。我想在哪里跳伞就在哪里跳，又没料到会有人在街上站着。”她厉声说道。

"S-sorry." "对不起。"

"You better be sorry. Shouldn't you be in a shelter or something?"  
"你最好是真心的。你不是应该去避难所之类的地方吗？"

"They're all full and won't let me in... s-sorry-"  
"那些避难所都满了，不让我进去...对不起..."

"Stop apologizing for every little thing. Do you even have a spine?"  
"别为一点小事就道歉。你还有没有骨气？"

"Y-yes. Doesn't every-" "有、有的。不是每个人都有——"

"Not _that_ one! The _metaphorical_ one!" The girl rolled her eyes at Shinji's attempt to point to his backbone. God, this wimpy boy would have better off as a jellyfish. No one in their right minds would bother being around his kid for a second. Better off having him sent to the pound and put to sleep and pray to whatever Hindu god that reincarnates people to tape worms and slugs. Better get rid of him quic-  
"不是那个！是比喻意义上的！" 女孩对真嗣试图指向自己脊椎的动作翻了个白眼。天哪，这个懦弱的男孩还不如变成水母。正常人谁会愿意在他身边多待一秒。最好把他送到收容所安乐死，然后向能让人转世的印度神祈祷，让他下辈子变成绦虫和蛞蝓。最好快点摆脱他——

"Soryu Asuka Langley. You can address me as Soryu." Asuka's eyes widened slightly from shock as her mouth betrayed her. She just introduced herself to this worthless boy. A boy who wouldn't hold a candle to the love-of-her-life, Kaji.  
"惣流·明日香·兰格雷。你可以称呼我为惣流。" 明日香的眼睛因惊讶而微微睁大，她的嘴巴却不由自主地背叛了她。她刚刚向这个一无是处的男孩介绍了自己。一个与她心中的挚爱——加持先生——无法相提并论的男孩。

"A-ah. Miss Soryu. I am Ikari Shinji." Asuka wiggled her nose at the name. Sounded awfully familiar... oh well, probably not important.  
"啊，惣流小姐。我是碇真嗣。" 明日香听到这个名字时皱了皱鼻子。听起来异常熟悉...哦，算了，可能并不重要。

"Alright sex offender Shinji, where are you off to on this fine totally-not-dangerous day in this totally-not-dangerous place?" Asuka mused.  
"好吧，性骚扰者真嗣，在这个美好且绝对安全的、在这个绝对安全的地方，你今天打算去哪儿呢？" 明日香打趣道。

"I'm not a sex offender," Shinji replied with a hint of annoyance.  
"我不是性侵犯，" 真嗣带着一丝不悦回答道。

"You're absolutely right! You're not a sexy offender y_et_. Hey don't give me that look. Alright, alright. Bad joke. What are you doing here anyways, sex-deviant Ikari?"  
"你说的完全正确！你现在还不是性感的罪犯。嘿，别那样看我。好吧，好吧。这是个糟糕的笑话。那你在这里做什么，性变态的碇？"

Sighing, the poor boy replied. "I'm suppose to meet someone but she never showed up. Then I wandered around for a few hours. Then you landed on me-"  
叹了口气，可怜的男孩回答说："我本来是要见一个人的，但她没出现。然后我就在附近闲逛了几个小时。然后你就砸到我了——"

"Excuse me?" "劳驾？"

"What?" "什么？"

"You mean you got in the way of my landing."  
"你的意思是你妨碍了我着陆。"

"What? No, I didn't- Oh never mind. Yes, I got in the way of your landing. And now I'm here with you, Miss Soryu."  
"什么？不，我没有——哦，算了。是的，我妨碍了你的着陆。现在我和你在一起了，Soryu 小姐。"

Asuka brought a hand up to her chin in deep thought. Her situation wasn't much different from the boy's. A few hours ago she was in NERV-Branch in Berlin enjoying the comforts of being a distinguished Evangelion pilot - an elite position offered only to the most deserving and selective of candidates. Then she received word that the NERV-HQ in Tokyo-3 desperately requiring her presence ahead of schedule.  
明日香用手托着下巴，陷入沉思。她的处境和这个男孩并无太大不同。几小时前，她还在柏林的 NERV 分部享受着作为杰出 EVA 驾驶员的舒适——这是一个只提供给最优秀、最精选候选人的精英职位。随后，她接到消息，东京-3 的 NERV 总部急需她提前到达。

Asuka was not told the exact specifics of the situation. But she was prepared for the worst.  
明日香并未被告知具体情况。但她已做好最坏的准备。

A two hour flight in the fastest jet the German Air Force could offer followed by an emergency jettison due to engine failure resulted in her current situation.  
乘坐德国空军提供的最快喷气式飞机两小时飞行后，因引擎故障紧急弹射，导致了她目前的处境。

"Well, people are looking for me," Asuka assured, though to who in particular was not certain. "I've got to get to NERV-HQ. I'll have you know I'm a pretty important person-"  
“嗯，有人在找我，”明日香保证道，尽管具体是谁并不确定。“我得去 NERV 总部。我得告诉你，我可是个相当重要的人物——”

"NERV-HQ? I'm trying to find my way there too. We're heading the same direction, then. The Geofront, right?" Catching the mortified look of Asuka, Shinji began to profusely apologize.  
“NERV 总部？我也在试图找到那里。那我们方向一致了，是去地下都市吧？”注意到明日香惊恐的表情，真嗣开始连声道歉。

What? This wimpy kid is heading towards NERV-HQ? What the hell _for_? Asuka thought to herself. Looking the boy once over, she determined to herself he would be of no use militarily in such an emergency. Civilians would have been sent to shelters or evacuated. Only reason she could think of for some kid like him heading to NERVHQ during a crisis was...  
什么？这个弱不禁风的小子正朝 NERV 总部去？他到底想干嘛？明日香暗自思忖。她仔细打量了男孩一番，断定在如此紧急情况下，他军事上毫无用处。平民早该被送往避难所或撤离了。她能想到的，这种小孩在危机时刻前往 NERV 总部的唯一理由是……

And before Shinji knew it, he was on his chest with his arms pinned to his backpack.  
还没等真嗣反应过来，他就已经趴在地上，双臂被压在背包下。

"Ha! I knew there were extremist elements out in this backwater country trying to infiltrate NERV-HQ. Seizing an opportunity in a moment of crisis, huh? Clever... but you didn't factor in Soryu Asuka Langley! Didn't think I'd find a spy so quickly! Luckily, I'm constantly vigilante for scum like you," Asuka congratulated to herself as she sat down on her prey. Asuka pulled off her necktie and used it to tie Shinji's arms together.  
"哈！我就知道这个偏远国家里有些极端分子试图渗透 NERV 总部。趁危机时刻抓住机会，是吧？聪明……但你没料到会有我——惣流·明日香·兰格雷！没想到这么快就抓到间谍！幸好我时刻警惕着你们这种败类。" 明日香一边自得其乐，一边坐在她的“猎物”上。她解下领带，用来绑住了真嗣的双臂。

"W-what? I really was told to go to NERV-HQ! I'm not a spy!"  
"什么？我真的被告知要去 NERV 总部！我不是间谍！"

"Ha! _Precisely_ what a spy would say!"  
"哈！这正是间谍会说的话！"

"No! It's _precisely_ what a normal person would say!" Asuka would hear none of it as she finished the knots and kicked the boy back up on his feet.  
"不！这正是普通人会说的话！" 明日香不听他解释，绑好绳结后一脚将男孩踢回站立姿势。

"Come on. Get up, criminal scum. First notorious pervert and now traitor-spy of humanity. How low can you sink?" Asuka began kicking the back of Shinji's knees towards a random direction.  
"快点，起来，罪犯渣滓。先是臭名昭著的变态，现在又是人类的叛徒间谍。你还能堕落到什么地步？" 明日香开始朝着某个随机方向踢真嗣的膝盖后面。

"I'm telling you I'm not a spy!"  
"我告诉你，我不是间谍！"

---

"I'm... telling you... I'm not a spy... Miss Soryu please..." Shinji begged with a watery mouth and weary eyes.  
"我... 我告诉你... 我不是间谍... 惣流小姐，请您..." 真嗣带着口水和疲惫的眼神哀求道。

Beside him, the Red Demon was seated on a bench enjoying a nice late lunch.  
在他旁边，红魔正坐在长椅上享受一顿美味的午餐。

It was over two hours since the red demon began leading them, painfully directionless, towards NERV-HQ. The afternoon march through dead ends and empty streets in the eternal summer heat was devastating to the already poorly athletic Shinji. He was thirsty, exhausted and hungry from nearly a day's worth of travel and lack of adequate meals. Asuka had just finished looting-correction, _appropriated from_-a convenience store. She decided to enjoy three packed lunches, a few energy drinks and a hearty helping of packaged cookies.  
自从红魔开始带领他们，无目的地向 NERV 总部前进，已经过去了两个多小时。在永恒的夏日酷热中，穿过死胡同和空荡荡的街道的下午行军，对本就不擅长运动的真嗣来说简直是毁灭性的。他口渴、疲惫，而且因为将近一天的旅行和缺乏适当的餐食而感到饥饿。明日香刚刚洗劫——更正，是从一家便利店征用了物资。她决定享用三份便当，几瓶能量饮料和一大份包装饼干。

And Shinji's eyes begged each time Asuka took a clump of rice and fried chicken into her mouth.  
每当明日香将一团米饭和炸鸡送入口中时，真嗣的眼神都充满了渴望。

"What is it, criminal scum? Hungry?" Shinji nodded eagerly. "Well sorry, you lost your right to food the moment you decided to _spy_."  
"什么事儿，罪犯渣滓？饿了？" 真嗣急切地点头。"抱歉，你一决定当间谍，就失去了吃饭的权利。"

"I'm telling you... Miss Soryu... I'm not a spy. Please... just some water..." Shinji eyed the mineral water standing idle beside the girl.  
"我告诉你……Soryu 小姐……我不是间谍。求你了……给点水吧……" 真嗣盯着女孩旁边闲置的矿泉水。

Asuka eyed him carefully. Then sighed to herself as she went back into the store feeling Shinji's needy eyes following her.  
明日香仔细打量了他一番，然后叹了口气，回到店里，感觉到真嗣那渴望的目光一直跟随着她。

Spy or not, he was a human being. And prisoners of war must be treated humanely...  
不论是否间谍，他终究是人。战俘必须得到人道的对待……

"M-miss Soryu? W-what's this?"  
索龙小姐？这、这是什么？

Asuka smirked to herself as she set the piece down in front of her. She could stretch the definition of humanely.  
明日香暗自得意，将棋子摆放在自己面前。她可以对'人道'的定义稍作延伸。

"It's a doggie bowl," Asuka stated confidently as she unscrewed the mineral water. "Luckily the convenience store had a few on shelf."  
"这是个小狗碗，" 明日香自信地说着，拧开矿泉水瓶盖。"幸好便利店货架上还有几个。"

"B-but I'm not a dog."  
"可我不是狗啊。"

"Be happy you're even getting this," Asuka said as she filled the bowl. Shinji sighed in utter defeat before leaning over to drink with whatever little dignity he had left.  
"有得喝就不错了，" 明日香边说边往碗里倒水。真嗣叹了口气，彻底认输，然后俯身用他仅剩的一点尊严去喝水。

Asuka found it amusing to see the spectacle but grew bored of it quick. Realizing the wimp had a backpack that she neglected to scrounge through the contents of, Asuka reached over and began sorting through it while Shinji was still face deep in the bowl.  
明日香觉得这场面挺有趣，但很快就厌倦了。意识到那个懦夫背着一个她还没来得及翻找的背包，明日香伸手过去，开始在真嗣还埋头于碗中时翻找起来。

"Hmm... SDAT player. Some books on cooking... Ew, underwear... _oh ho oh_, what's this?" Asuka mused to herself as she found an interesting object. A picture...  
“嗯... SDAT 播放器。几本烹饪书... 噫，内衣... 哦嚯，这是什么？”明日香自言自语地发现了一个有趣的物品。一张照片...

"Hey! Miss Soryu please! Don't touch that!" Shinji barked as he did his best to retrieve the picture with his teeth. He began chomping in the air as he edged close towards the picture which Asuka held above her head.  
“喂！绫波小姐，请别碰那个！”真嗣大声喊道，尽力用牙齿去夺回那张照片。他开始在空中咬合，试图靠近明日香高举在头顶的照片。

Shinji's face was dripping from his earlier attempts to drink water. Droplets of mineral water fell onto her white cotton shirt, gently dampening it. Had Shinji continued this, it may have revealed the white bra that encased the rather disappointing bust size of Soryu Asuka Langley.  
真嗣的脸庞因先前尝试喝水而滴着水珠。矿泉水滴落在她那件白色棉质衬衫上，轻轻将其打湿。如果真嗣继续这样，或许会显露出包裹着索龙·明日香·兰格雷那令人失望的胸围的白色胸罩。

None of this really bothered Asuka, the teasing was far too fun.  
这些对明日香来说其实都无所谓，捉弄人的乐趣实在太大了。

"Please-_chomp_!-Miss Soryu-_chomp_!-It's not funny! _Chomp_, _chomp_, _chomp_!"  
“请-咔嚓！-索龙小姐-咔嚓！-这不好笑！咔嚓，咔嚓，咔嚓！”

Asuka was all smiles. "This is far too fun you-"  
明日香满脸笑容。“这太有趣了，你——”

Then Shinji's mouth got dangerously close to Asuka's face. His breath tickled her nose and lips.  
随后，真嗣的嘴危险地靠近了明日香的脸。他的呼吸轻拂过她的鼻尖和嘴唇。

_Slap_!

"-sexual... deviant..." Asuka muttered to herself as she panted. She looked over at the boy crumpled up on the ground struggling to get up. Ignoring his plight, Asuka looked at the picture.  
“——性...变态...”明日香喘着气自言自语。她看向那个蜷缩在地上挣扎着要站起来的男孩。无视他的困境，明日香看向那张照片。

It was a beautiful woman.  
那是一位美丽的女子。

The woman in the photo appeared young and vibrant. Full of life with short brown hair and kind eyes. She looked... angelic.  
照片中的女子显得年轻而充满活力，棕色的短发，和善的眼神，她看起来...宛如天使。

"Hey sex-deviant. Who's this?" Asuka brought a hand to her chin in an attempt to disguise her curiosity as she waved the picture at the boy laying on the ground.  
“嘿，色狼。这是谁？”明日香用手托着下巴，试图掩饰自己的好奇心，同时向躺在地上的男孩挥动着照片。

"That's my mother..." "那是我的母亲……"

Asuka's eyes widened. For such a beautiful woman to have such a wimpy kid... his dad must have brought down the genetic quality hard.  
明日香的眼睛瞪大了。如此美丽的女人竟有这样一个懦弱的孩子……他的父亲一定严重拉低了基因质量。

"Where is she now?" "她现在在哪里？"

"She's dead, Miss Soryu," Shinji stated as managed to sit upright and attempted to balance his shaken legs to stand up.  
"她已经死了，Soryu 小姐，" 真嗣说着，努力坐直身体，试图稳定他那颤抖的双腿站起来。

What is this sensation? Asuka wondered to herself. A sense of pity? Was it... condolences? No... it was something else entirely... A feeling someone can feel only if they've experienced what you've experienced... a connection that binds two souls.  
这是什么感觉？明日香自问。是同情吗？还是...哀悼？不...这完全是另一种感觉...只有经历过你所经历的人才能感受到的情感...一种将两个灵魂紧紧相连的纽带。

_Empathy_. 共情。

"Here. I'll tease your urges just this once," Asuka sighed watching Shinji struggle vainly to stand up. Putting the photo back into her skirt pocket, she walked over to the boy.  
"这里。我就挑逗你的欲望这一次吧," 明日香叹了口气，看着真嗣徒劳地试图站起来。她把照片放回裙子的口袋里，走过去扶起那个男孩。

"Just don't throw away the photo. It's the only one I have. And I don't have any urges to teas-ah!" Shinji felt Asuka's slender arms underneath his armpits as she helped him up and sat him down on the bench.  
"只是别扔掉那张照片。那是我唯一的一张。而且我并没有什么欲望要挑逗——啊！" 真嗣感觉到明日香纤细的手臂从他的腋下穿过，帮助他站起来并坐在长凳上。

Shinji watched in silent shock as Asuka began opening the last of the packed lunch meals. A fried chicken set consisting of a macaroni salad, slice of cucumber, tomato and egg with the titular fried chicken pieces resting on a bed of lettuce. The sight of such deliciousness made Shinji realize his persistent hunger.  
真嗣默默地惊讶地看着明日香开始打开最后一盒便当。一份炸鸡套餐，包括通心粉沙拉、黄瓜片、番茄和鸡蛋，以及放在生菜床上的主角炸鸡块。看到如此美味的食物，真嗣意识到自己持续的饥饿感。

At least Asuka didn't have to tell Shinji to open his gaping mouth.  
至少明日香不必告诉真嗣张开他那张大嘴。

"Asuka what are-dommfgh!"  
“明日香，你这是——唔唔唔！”

"Don't talk with your mouth full, idiot," as Asuka averted her eyes back down to the lunch, preparing a second delivery of a mouth of delicious goodness.  
“别满嘴食物说话，笨蛋，”明日香边说边将目光转回午餐，准备再次送上一口美味佳肴。

"Miss Soryu?" Shinji's bewildered eyes widened. Did a pretty girl just...  
"早见小姐？" 真嗣困惑地睁大了眼睛。难道刚才是一个漂亮的女孩……

"Enjoy it, idiot. You're the first person I've ever had to feed. You know mortals would kill for the honor," Asuka huffed smugly as she sent expedition number two into Shinji's open mouth.  
"好好享受吧，笨蛋。你可是我第一个喂食的人。要知道，凡人为了这份荣耀可是会争得头破血流的，" 明日香得意地哼了一声，将第二口食物送进了真嗣张开的嘴里。

"I a-appreciate it, Miss Soryu," Shinji thanked.  
"我，我很感激，早见小姐，" 真嗣感谢道。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "Can't have the Geneva Conventions get on my case about starving a prisoner of war."  
明日香翻了个白眼。“总不能让《日内瓦公约》因为我饿着战俘来找我麻烦吧。”

"P-prisoner of war? What?"  
战俘？什么？

Asuka brought a finger to her bottom lip and looked up thoughtfully.  
明日香将手指放在下唇上，若有所思地抬头望去。

"Then again, spies aren't considered lawful combatants you aren't afforded such protection... I suppose I could torture you..."  
"再说了，间谍并不被视为合法战斗人员，你无法享有这种保护...我想我可以折磨你..."

"T-torture!? Miss Soryu, please..."  
"折、折磨！？早乙女小姐，请不要..."

"Ah, but then all that blood... I don't want to smell like a corpse for a week..."  
"啊，但是那么多血...我可不想一周都闻起来像尸体一样..."

Shinji froze in horror, his eyes going to a distant dream world visualizing in great detail the terror this woman could unleash. Images of whips and spikes in a dungeon where Miss Soryu demanded she be called _The Mistress_. And today _The Mistress_ was wearing black lace...  
真嗣惊恐地僵住了，他的目光投向一个遥远的梦境世界，在那里他详细地想象着这个女人可能释放的恐怖。脑海中浮现出鞭子和尖刺的地牢场景，那里索龙小姐要求别人称她为女主人。而今天，女主人穿着黑色蕾丝……

"Black lace..." Shinji said absentmindedly.  
"黑色蕾丝……" 真嗣心不在焉地说道。

"Black... lace...? W-what...? _Pervert_!" _Slap_!  
"黑色……蕾丝……？什、什么……？变态！" 啪！

"Ow!"

"I knew it! I knew it! This country is full of disgusting criminal deviants that run around amok trying to get every girl to fit their sick twisted fantasies!"  
"我就知道！我就知道！这个国家到处都是令人作呕的犯罪变态，他们四处横行，试图让每个女孩都符合他们病态扭曲的幻想！"

"Says the girl in the Catholic schoolgirl outfit..." _Slap_!  
"说这话的女孩还穿着天主教校服呢……"" 啪！

"I happened to be in school when I was called over here to this frickin' country."  
"我正好在学校时被叫到这个该死的国家来。"

"'_This_' country? Where are you from?" _Slap_!  
这个'国家'? 你从哪儿来?" 啪!

"Germany, you deviant-idiot. I was enjoying a nice lecture on the inner workings of metaphysical biology in Munich a few hours ago-"  
德国，你这个异类白痴。我几个小时前还在慕尼黑享受一场关于形而上学生物学内部机制的精彩讲座——

"'_'Munich'_? You went from Germany to Japan in like an hour? _Who_ are you?" Shinji winced and cowered in anticipation of a retribution slap.  
‘慕尼黑’？你从德国到日本只用了一个小时？你到底是谁？" 真嗣皱眉并缩着身子，准备迎接可能的报复性一巴掌。

Instead, Asuka tossed back her hair with an arrogant smirk.  
相反，明日香傲慢地甩了甩头发，露出一丝得意的笑容。

"I am Soryu Asuka Langley, pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, first combat model Eva-"  
我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，二号机驾驶员，第一台实战型 EVA——

"What's an Evangelion?" 什么是 EVA？

Asuka's eyes widened. Oh crap, she realized. _That_ wasn't suppose to be publicly known. _That_ of course being the multi-trillion dollar secret bio-organic weapon: Evangelion.  
明日香的眼睛瞪大了。哦不，她意识到。那本不该是公开的秘密。当然，那就是价值数万亿的秘密生物有机武器：福音战士。

Looking at the boy once over, she shrugged.  
她再次打量了一下那个男孩，然后耸了耸肩。

Even if he was a spy, everyone will know about the Evas sooner or later.  
即便他是间谍，大家迟早也会知道 Eva 的存在。

"The Evangelion is a secret weapon developed by NERV meant to combat the Angels. The Angels of course being-"  
"福音战士是 NERV 秘密研发的武器，旨在对抗使徒。当然，使徒指的是——"

"Giant floating alien humanoid-like monsters that are out to destroy mankind?"  
"那些巨大的、漂浮的、类似人形的外星怪物，目的是摧毁人类？"

"Stop interrupting me." Asuka squinted her eyes. "You sure you're not a spy?" Asuka accused as she gave Shinji a glare.  
"别打断我。" 明日香眯起眼睛，"你确定你不是间谍？" 她瞪了真嗣一眼，质问道。

"S-sorry...b-but..." Shinji began nodding his head, as his arms were still tied behind his back, in the direction behind Asuka.  
"对不起...但是..." 真嗣开始点头，尽管他的双臂仍被绑在背后，朝着明日香身后的方向。

Asuka turned around. Some twenty blocks away, loomed a giant humanoid being with a bone-like mask floating in midair. A red orb on its chest and strange organs were breathing on its thigh. A small fleet of helicopters surrounded it and a screeching hail of missiles began approaching it.  
明日香转过身。大约二十个街区之外，一个戴着骨状面具的巨大人形生物悬浮在半空中。其胸前有一个红色球体，大腿上的奇怪器官似乎在呼吸。一队直升机围绕着它，导弹如暴雨般尖啸着向它袭来。

The Third Angel - _Sachiel_.  
第三使徒 - 萨基尔。

In an instant came an onslaught of missiles, rockets and heavy ordinance from the UN-JSSDF Combined Third Army.  
刹那间，来自联合国-日本自卫队联合第三军的导弹、火箭和重型炮火如潮水般袭来。

"_Asuka_! _Run_!" “明日香！快跑！”

_Booom_! 轰隆！

---

"Go faster damn you!" Asuka screamed at the steering wheel as though it were a steed that heeded the frustrated commands of its owner.  
"快点，该死的！" 明日香对着方向盘尖叫，仿佛它是一匹听从主人沮丧命令的坐骑。

The desperate pair of teenagers were now driving through the windy hill roads away from the giant monster. Asuka, through quick thinking, managed to shove her captive-or is it hostage?-into a nearby red car and quickly hot-wired it. Although a rather simple skill acquired for the sake of practical emergencies, the situation at hand unhinged her nerves causing the action to take a few seconds longer than it should have.  
这对绝望的少年正驾车穿过蜿蜒的山路，逃离那头巨型怪兽。明日香急中生智，将她的俘虏——或者说人质？——塞进一辆附近的红色汽车，并迅速接线启动。虽然这是一项为应对实际紧急情况而习得的简单技能，但眼前的局势让她神经紧绷，导致这一动作比平时多花了好几秒。

And this took quite a toll on her sanity.  
这对她的理智造成了相当大的冲击。

"Alright... that thing being here explains a lot," Asuka muttered to herself. Now she realized why she was urgently needed at NERV-HQ in this godforsaken country filled with perverts. The sole Japanese person she found in this foreign land was currently huddled in the passenger seat, arms still bound behind him, with his knees brought up to his face.  
"好吧...那东西在这里解释了很多，"明日香自言自语道。现在她明白了为什么在这个充满变态的该死国家里，她会被紧急召到 NERV 总部。在这个异国他乡，她唯一找到的日本人现在正蜷缩在乘客座位上，双臂仍被绑在背后，膝盖紧贴着脸。

"What's wrong with you?" Asuka cursed herself afterwards. The intensity of the situation made her come off as harsh.  
"你怎么了？"明日香随后咒骂自己。情况的紧张让她显得严厉。

"We forgot my backpack..." Shinji stated dejectedly.  
"我们忘了我的背包..." 真嗣沮丧地说。

"There wasn't anything important in there, just some underwear and an outdated SDAT player. I can buy you a new one if you want. Hell, I'll even sing a few songs for you."  
"里面没什么重要的东西，只是一些内衣和一个过时的 SDAT 播放器。如果你想要，我可以给你买个新的。甚至，我还可以为你唱几首歌。"

Shinji shook his head. "It's not that."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“不是那个。”

"Then what the hell could it be?"  
"那到底是什么鬼东西？"

"That was the only photo I had my mother, Miss Soryu."  
"那是我唯一拥有的母亲的照片，Soryu 小姐。"

Asuka's grip on the steering wheel loosened. Her fingers turned cold. That feeling again. That feeling of empathy. Asuka looked over at the boy. Poor kid lost his mom, might have knew her better than Asuka knew her own mother.  
明日香的握着方向盘的手松开了。她的手指变得冰凉。又是那种感觉。那种同情感。明日香看向那个男孩。可怜的孩子失去了母亲，可能比明日香更了解自己的母亲。

Then Asuka remembered. 然后明日香想起来了。

Parking the car on the side, Asuka removed the bindings on Shinji's arms.  
将车停在路边，明日香解开了绑在真嗣手臂上的束缚。

"Thanks for undoing these out of pity," Shinji thanked soft as he held up his wrist. "But it... s-sorry."  
“谢谢你出于怜悯解开这些，”真嗣轻声道谢，同时举起手腕。“但这样……对-对不起。”

"Stop apologizing and stop being so gloomy, idiot. And it wasn't for pity," Asuka said as she fumbled through her skirt pocket. Shinji's eyes widened in amazement.  
“别再道歉了，也别这么闷闷不乐，笨蛋。而且不是因为怜悯，”明日香说着，在裙子的口袋里摸索。真嗣的眼睛惊讶地睁大了。

"M-miss Soryu!" Shinji's eyes began tearing as his hands shivered. He gently took hold of the photo, holding it as it were made of ethereal cloth that would dissipate in a moment of rough contact.  
"小姐，索吕！" 真嗣的眼眶开始湿润，双手颤抖着。他小心翼翼地拿起那张照片，仿佛它是用易散的轻纱制成，稍一用力就会消散无踪。

Asuka rolled her eyes. "I-it's not l-like I kept s-safe it for you or a-anything," she stuttered. A strange tingly sensation in her chest was getting on her nerves and affecting her speech mannerisms. She made a mental note to get it checked out.  
明日香翻了个白眼。"我-我可不是为了你才保管它的，"她结巴地说。胸口传来一阵奇怪的刺痛感，让她心烦意乱，连说话方式都受到了影响。她在心里记下，得去检查一下。

"Thank you, Miss Soryu. It means a lot to me. I'm in your debt." Asuka blushed a crimson hue as her mind raced to the many _different_ ways she could be repaid...  
"谢谢你，索吕小姐。这对我意义重大。我欠你一个人情。" 明日香的脸颊泛起一片绯红，脑海中飞速闪过各种可能的回报方式……

"Y-you can c-call me A-Asuka," she stated looking away from him as she worked began restarting the car.  
"你...你可以叫我明日香，"她一边说着，一边避开他的目光，开始重新启动汽车。

"Why?" "为什么？"

Asuka nearly ran off a cliff, realizing she just offered such intimacy with a boy she barely met.  
明日香差点把车开下悬崖，意识到自己竟然对一个刚认识不久的男孩透露了如此亲密的信息。

"B-because it's my treat. Y-you called me Asuka when that Angel attacked right? I owe you for the heads up. B-but in exchange I get to call you whatever I w-want."  
"因为这次是我请客。你之前在那个使徒袭击时叫我明日香了对吧？我欠你一个人情。不过作为交换，我可以随便怎么称呼你。"

"S-sure," Shinji smiled as he went back to admiring the treasured photo. "Thank you, Asuka."  
"当然可以，" 真嗣微笑着继续欣赏那张珍贵的照片。"谢谢你，明日香。"

Asuka breathed a sigh of relief. Out of the corner of the eye she saw Shinji still looking at the photo, no doubt trying to scorch the image into his mind.  
明日香松了一口气。她眼角余光瞥见真嗣仍在凝视那张照片，无疑是在努力将这幅画面烙印在脑海中。

"You know you can get that scanned and uploaded into some databank. So you can never lose it."  
"你知道你可以把它扫描并上传到某个数据库中。这样你就永远不会丢失它了。"

Shinji blinked. 真嗣眨了眨眼。

"I'm not very good with computers," Shinji admitted with embarrassment.  
"我对电脑不太在行，" 真嗣有些尴尬地承认道。

"I'll hold your hands through it," Asuka offered quietly. Was that a Freudian slip...  
"我会牵着你的手一起走，"明日香轻声提议。这是不是弗洛伊德式口误...

"R-really? Thank you again, Miss Sor-I mean-Asuka."  
"真的吗？再次感谢你，索尔小姐——我是说——明日香。"

Asuka breathed in deeply as she sunk back into the seat as they drove into a tunnel that read '_Entrance to NERV-HQ_'. The leather was irritating her sweaty backside.  
随着车辆驶入标有'NERV 总部入口'的隧道，明日香深吸一口气，沉回座位。皮革让她汗湿的背部感到不适。

---

"Are you sure we aren't lost, Asuka?" Though Shinji had to admit Asuka was an impressive beauty with an eccentric array of skills and hobbies, he found her to be lacking directionally.  
"你确定我们没迷路吗，明日香？" 尽管真嗣不得不承认明日香是个令人印象深刻的美女，拥有一系列古怪的技能和爱好，但他觉得她在方向感上有所欠缺。

The entrance to NERV-HQ had given them an elevator ride to the Geofront, a massive subterranean cavity that housed the headquarters of NERV, Central Dogma.  
通往 NERV 总部的入口让他们乘坐电梯来到了地下巨大空洞——第三新东京市地下的 Geofront，那里坐落着 NERV 的总部，中央教条。

"Of course we're not lost, idiot! We just don't know where we are."  
"当然没迷路，笨蛋！我们只是不知道自己在哪儿而已。"

You realize how bad that looks on paper, Shinji thought to himself. Sighing, he continued following her until she began screaming curses.  
你意识到这看起来有多糟糕，真嗣心想。叹了口气，他继续跟着她，直到她开始尖叫咒骂。

"Another dead-end! Are you kidding me? I memorized the entire map of this place! This should be the main transit hub!"  
又一个死胡同！你在开玩笑吗？我把这个地方的地图全记住了！这里应该是主要的交通枢纽！

Then Asuka let loose a furious scream that would wake the dead from hell."I swear with God as my witness I'll axe murder the architects who designed this damned place!"  
随后，明日香发出了一声愤怒的尖叫，足以让地狱中的死者惊醒。'我以上帝的名义发誓，我要用斧头谋杀设计这个该死地方的建筑师！'

"R-really, Asuka?" Asuka looked back in fury and Shinji was met with two demonic-possessed blue eyes.  
"真的吗，明日香？" 明日香愤怒地回头，真嗣迎上了两道仿佛被恶魔附身的蓝色目光。

"Axe. _Murder_." "斧头。谋杀。"

"O-okay..."The pair continued down a catwalk overlooking what appeared to be a bottomless pit.  
"好...好吧..." 两人继续沿着一座天桥前行，下方似乎是一个无底深渊。

"I swear, if this were NERV-Branch Germany, we'd at least _find_ someone by now. You know, we actually have _people_ to staff our bases. Not endless dead-ends and mazes for hallways."  
"我发誓，如果这是 NERV 德国分部，我们至少现在能找到个人。你知道吗，我们那里真的有人来运营基地。而不是无尽的死胡同和迷宫般的走廊。

Asuka was fuming as she looked back towards her traveling partner who was a good distance was grasping the handrails with both arms, eyes shut and moving slowly.  
明日香气愤地回头看向她的旅伴，那人离她有一段距离，正用双臂紧握着扶手，双眼紧闭，缓慢地移动着。

"What's holding you up?" Asuka inquired, doing her best to mellow out her anger at the situation towards Shinji.  
"你到底在磨蹭什么？" 明日香尽量克制自己对这种情况的愤怒，向真嗣发问。

"S-sorry," Shinji apologized as he slowly opened his eyes towards Asuka's approach.  
"对不起，" 碇真嗣一边道歉，一边缓缓睁开眼睛，望向朝他走来的明日香。

"Afraid of heights, idiot?"  
"恐高啊，笨蛋？"

"Y-yeah... s-sorry," Shinji apologized. Asuka rolled her eyes.  
"嗯...对...对不起，" 碇真嗣再次道歉。明日香翻了个白眼。

Then she began stomping on the catwalk.  
随后，她开始在 T 台上跺脚。

"A-Asuka! Asuka, please!" Shinji cried as he desperately clung to the handrails as the shock waves emanating from Asuka's foot reached him.  
“啊，明日香！明日香，请停下！” 真嗣绝望地紧抓着扶手，随着明日香脚步产生的冲击波传到他这里，他大声呼喊。

Laughing menacingly to herself she let out one final stomp.  
她狞笑着，最后重重地跺了一脚。

Before she herself toppled onto the ground from the earthquake landing on her back, grabbing the handrail for support. Shinji clung to them even more furiously on his knees.  
在地震中她自己倒地之前，抓住扶手以支撑身体。真嗣更是跪在地上，紧紧抓住它们。

The fighting is getting closer to the Central Dogma, Asuka thought to herself. Just when I was having fun-oh wait. Now's not the time to be having fun. Something something, Angel's attacking and saving the world and crap, Asuka thought to herself. Best not waste anymore time finding someone...  
战斗越来越接近中央教条了，明日香心想。就在我玩得开心的时候——哦等等。现在不是玩乐的时候。什么什么，天使正在攻击，拯救世界之类的，明日香心想。最好别再浪费时间找人了……

Asuka eyed her rather heavy baggage of a companion and decided perhaps her teasing was beginning to be detrimental.  
明日香看着她那位相当沉重的同伴，觉得自己的调侃可能开始变得有害了。

"Here," Asuka looked away in the distance as she offered her hand to the terrified boy.  
"这里，"明日香望向远方，向惊恐的男孩伸出了手。

Shinji blinked at her soft hand with slender digits. Confusion to the situation was all over his face.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，看着她那纤细手指的柔软手掌，满脸都是对情况的困惑。

"Be grateful. You must surely be blessed by the heavens themselves. Not only do you get the honor of being fed by me, I'm letting you hold my hand," Asuka huffed.  
"你应该感到庆幸。你肯定是得到了天神的眷顾。不仅有机会被我喂食，我还允许你握我的手，"明日香哼了一声。

"T-thank you," Shinji reached for it and clasped it tightly.  
"谢谢你，" 真嗣伸手紧紧抓住了它。

"Ugh," Asuka muttered to herself. Shinji apologized immediately. "Sweaty palms..." Shinji immediately attempted to release Asuka's hand.  
"呃，" 明日香自言自语道。真嗣立刻道歉。"手心出汗了..." 真嗣立刻试图放开明日香的手。

"S-sorry, Asuka. You don't have to-"  
"对-对不起，明日香。你不必-"

"Shut it. Apologize one more time and I'll throw you into the bottomless pit," Asuka stated as she tugged Shinji along. Her grip on his hand tightened and her fingers intertwined with his.  
"闭嘴。再道歉一次，我就把你扔进无底洞，" 明日香一边说着，一边拉着真嗣往前走。她握着他的手紧了紧，手指与他的交缠在一起。

This is nice, the pair of teenagers thought. The consensus they reached was independently achieved. Shinji kept his gaze low and smiled, it was the first time he's ever held a girl's hand. Asuka herself gave an arrogant smirk. Holding a guy's hand isn't so hard, she assured herself who was just as inexperienced as Shinji. First this little wimps, next will be her destined spouse, Kaji!  
这对少年少女心想，这感觉真不错。他们各自独立地达成了共识。真嗣目光低垂，微笑着，这是他第一次牵女孩子的手。而明日香则露出一丝傲慢的笑意。牵男孩子的手也没那么难，她对自己这个同样缺乏经验的人保证。先从这小懦夫开始，下一个就是她命中注定的伴侣，加持先生！

"You're no Kaji..." Asuka muttered under her breath as they neared the end of the catwalk.  
"你不是加持……" 明日香在他们接近走道的尽头时低声嘟囔道。

"I'm not Kaju-what now?" Shinji inquired.  
"我不是卡珠-什么现在？" 真嗣询问道。

"Kaji. He's... H-he's my...b-boyfriend back in NERV-Branch Germany." Shinji's eyes widened in horror and he began releasing his grip from Asuka's hand.  
"是卡吉。他...他是我在 NERV 德国分部的...男朋友。" 真嗣的眼睛因惊恐而睁大，他开始松开握住明日香的手。

"What's wrong, idiot?" Asuka brought both her hands to her hips as she stared down the idiot who stepped back away from her.  
"怎么了，笨蛋？" 明日香双手叉腰，盯着那个后退远离她的笨蛋。

"S-sorry. I didn't know you had a b-b-b-bo-bo-"  
"对不起，我，我，我不知道你有男，男，男，男……"

"A boyfriend?" Asuka tilted her head innocently. "What a boring kid you are," Asuka scoffed as she tossed her hair back. "Of course someone as beautiful as myself would have a boyfriend." Asuka closed her eyes and smiled arrogantly.  
"男朋友？" 明日香歪着头，一脸无辜。"你真是个无趣的小孩，" 明日香嗤笑一声，甩了甩头发。"像我这样美丽的人，当然会有男朋友。" 明日香闭上眼睛，得意地笑了。

"S-s-sorry. I just didn't think it was right to-"  
"对，对不起。我只是觉得那样做不太合适……"

"It's fine. It's just holding hands. After all my Kaji is thirty years old and mature. Rich too. He'll understand. Not like I was sleeping with you or anything."  
"没关系，只是牵手而已。毕竟我的 Kaji 已经三十岁了，成熟稳重，又有钱。他会理解的。又不是我和你上床什么的。"

Shinji's eyes went low. Ah, he realized. Of course a girl like her would be doing things like that. With someone... older and mature. Not a spineless wimp like himself who's afraid of heights. Shinji looked at her again. She was beautiful, he admitted to himself and she was in a relationship with someone named Kaji.  
真嗣的眼神低垂下来。啊，他意识到了。像她这样的女孩，当然会和那样的人做那样的事。和某个...更成熟的人。而不是像他这样恐高的软骨头。真嗣再次看向她，他不得不承认，她很美，而且她和一个叫 Kaji 的人在交往。

For some reason, he felt hurt.  
不知为何，他感到心痛。

"H-hey. Come on, idiot. Don't be like that." Asuka nervously attempted to assure him as she reached out her hand again. "It's alright. He'll understand. Just take my hand-"  
"嘿，喂。别这样，傻瓜。" 明日香紧张地试图安慰他，再次伸出手。"没事的，他会理解的。快握住我的手——"

"_No_!" Shinji cried. "不！" 真嗣喊道。

And then, another earthquake shattered the structure.  
紧接着，又一次地震摧毁了建筑结构。

The catwalk was breaking apart, and Asuka stood teetering on the slowly breaking edge, her balance lost by the shock and speed of the quake. And Shinji whispered his personal mantra to himself.  
T 台正在崩裂，明日香站在缓缓断裂的边缘摇摇欲坠，地震的冲击和速度让她失去了平衡。而真嗣则低声对自己念叨着他的个人信条。

"_I mustn't run away_." “我不能逃跑。”

His fear of the heights had dulled the strength of his legs but Shinji found something to drive him. A taste of courage to empower him. Adrenaline and blood rushed through his body as he marshaled his strength.  
对高度的恐惧削弱了他的腿部力量，但真嗣找到了驱使自己的东西。一丝勇气的滋味赋予了他力量。肾上腺素和血液在他的体内奔涌，他聚集起自己的力量。

And pushed Asuka off the collapsing catwalk and onto the stable ridge of the pit.  
并将明日香从崩塌的步道上推到了坑中稳固的边缘。

"You _idiot_!" Auska screamed as Shinji realized what he had just miraculously accomplished.  
“你这个笨蛋！”明日香尖叫道，而真嗣意识到自己刚刚奇迹般地完成了什么。

In an instant, a twinkling, Shinji had vanished from Asuka's view deep into the darkness of the pit.  
刹那间，一闪而过，真嗣便消失在了坑底深邃的黑暗中，从明日香的视线中消失了。

"You idiot! You idiot, you idiot, you idiot... _You idiot_!" Asuka looked over the edge and screamed into the darkness, only to be replied with by echoes.  
"你这个白痴！你这个白痴，白痴，白痴...你这个白痴！" 明日香探头向黑暗中尖叫，只得到回声的回应。

"Dirty disgusting deviant! You goddamn moron! Unlovable jellyfish coward! Goddamn you! Goddamn you, you idiot!" Asuka's voice was coarse from the screaming.  
"肮脏恶心的变态！你这个该死的蠢货！没人爱的海蜇懦夫！该死的你！该死的你，你这个白痴！" 明日香的声音因尖叫而变得沙哑。

"You... _idiot_..." Asuka muttered to herself as tears welled up in her eyes. She knew this was not the time to cry. Humanity's survival was on the line. She couldn't be here worrying about some potential pervert, spy, wimpy coward little...no, not those things... she didn't have time to mourn a lost friend.  
"你...这个白痴..." 明日香喃喃自语，泪水在眼眶中打转。她知道这不是哭泣的时候。人类的存亡悬于一线。她不能在这里担心某个潜在的变态、间谍、懦弱的胆小鬼...不，不是那些...她没有时间为失去的朋友哀悼。

Soryu Asuka Langley owed Ikari Shinji her life.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷欠碇真嗣一条命。

Asuka sat at the ridge. A minute, she told herself. She needed a minute to collect her thoughts. A minute to grieve about the boy who she had nearly starved during the last few hours of his life. The boy whom she kept tied up. The boy whom she promised to scan the picture of her dead mother with... the first boy to hold her hand.  
明日香坐在山脊上。一分钟，她告诉自己。她需要一分钟来整理思绪。一分钟来哀悼那个在生命最后几小时几乎被她饿死的男孩。那个被她绑住的男孩。那个她承诺要扫描她已故母亲照片的男孩……第一个握住她手的男孩。

Asuka laid down on her back and didn't notice the swooshing of automatic doors and a stampede of footsteps approach her.  
明日香仰面躺下，没有注意到自动门的嗖嗖声和一群脚步声向她逼近。

"Asuka? Asuka! Oh thank God, we found you," came a elder female voice.  
"明日香？明日香！哦，感谢上帝，我们找到你了，"传来一位年长女性的声音。

"M-Misato?" Asuka whimpered as she hastily dried her red eyes. The familiar face of Captain Misato Katsuragi, a former handler of hers, graced Asuka's vision.  
"美里小姐？"明日香哽咽着，急忙擦干她那红肿的眼睛。熟悉的身影，她的前指挥官葛城美里上尉的面庞映入明日香的眼帘。

"Yeah, it's me. Damn it was a bad idea to put you on the experimental jet. When we heard the engine overheated and you had to eject we thought you were gone."  
"对，是我。真是个糟糕的主意，让你驾驶那架实验喷气机。当我们听说引擎过热，你不得不弹射时，我们都以为你完了。"

Asuka mumbled a few words.  
明日香嘟囔了几句。

"At least you're safe... sorry about not sending any search parties. We're a bit stretched in staff as it is. _Technicians_! _Check for damages_!" Misato barked orders to the small group with her as they began hastily running towards terminals and nodes to check for damages.  
"至少你安全了...抱歉没有派出搜救队。我们人手本来就紧张。技术人员！检查损坏情况！" 美里向她身边的小组大声下达命令，他们开始匆忙地跑向终端和节点检查损坏情况。

"How'd you find me?" 你怎么找到我的？

"You realize how loud you screamed just now?"  
"你意识到你刚才尖叫得有多大声吗？"

Asuka blushed with embarrassment.  
明日香羞红了脸。

"Sorry... I found someone to tag along with me... and now he's..." Asuka's eyes followed the destroyed catwalk.  
"抱歉...我找了个人陪我一起来...现在他..." 明日香的目光追随着被毁坏的走道。

"I'm sorry, we can have a nice funeral for him later but for now we have to get going."  
"对不起，我们可以稍后为他举行一个隆重的葬礼，但现在我们必须出发了。"

Asuka quickly dried her tears. "Let's go then, Captain."  
明日香迅速擦干眼泪。“那我们走吧，队长。”

"I'll tell you the situation once we hit the Unit-01 cage." Asuka had a fair idea of what to expect. She was going to pilot...  
"等我们到了零号机笼子那里，我会告诉你情况。" 明日香大致猜到了即将面对的情况。她将要驾驶...

They left the technicians to their work as Misato guided Asuka deeper into the innermost sanctums of Central Dogma. After a lull in silence, Misato decided to break it with a simple question.  
他们让技术人员继续工作，而碇真嗣则引导明日香深入到中央教条最核心的区域。一阵沉默之后，碇真嗣决定用一个简单的问题打破沉默。

"What was your companion's name?" Misato asked politely.  
“你同伴的名字是什么？”碇真嗣礼貌地问道。

"Ikari Shinji..." Asuka replied.  
“碇真嗣...”明日香回答道。

"Shinji... _Ikari_?" It did not escape Asuka's notice as a look of fear and shock crept on Misato's face.  
"真嗣... 碇？" 当恐惧和震惊的表情爬上美里脸庞时，明日香并未忽视这一点。

"Oh goddamn shi-" "哦，该死的..."

---

"Wait, let me get this straight," Asuka said as she followed along a visibly shaken Misato down through the corridors towards the cages.  
"等等，让我搞清楚，" 明日香说着，跟随明显动摇的美里沿着走廊向笼子走去。

"You were suppose to pick up this Ikari Shinji, son of Commander Ikari, to use as a reserve pilot in case I didn't arrive in time. But you _forgot to pick him up_?"  
"你本应该去接这个碇真嗣，碇司令的儿子，作为备用驾驶员以防我未能及时赶到。但你忘了去接他？"

"It really slipped my mind," Misato said absentmindedly with a twinge of guilt in her voice. "Kind of busy and all here..."  
"这事确实从我脑海中溜走了，" 葛城美里有些心不在焉地说，声音中带着一丝愧疚。"这里实在太忙了……"

"Are you serious, Misato?"  
"你是认真的吗，葛城？"

"That's Captain Misato. Thank you very much," Misato replied irritably.  
"那就是密薩托舰长。非常感谢，" 密薩托不耐烦地回答道。

Asuka sighed. Her perceptions of that wimpy kid from before were quite ruined. Commander Ikari was known for his fearsome reputation as heartless and calculating strategist. He was capable of political intrigue, sound military tactics and brutally efficient command. Perhaps spines didn't run in the family...  
明日香叹了口气。她之前对那个懦弱孩子的印象彻底破灭了。碇司令以其冷酷无情和精于算计的战略家名声而闻名。他擅长政治阴谋、稳健的军事策略和残酷高效的指挥。也许家族里并没有坚韧不拔的基因……

"You sure this kid wasn't some kind of spy?"  
"你确定这孩子不是某种间谍吗？"

"Psych profile said he could barely talk to kids his age. Can't imagine him communicating secrets that well."  
"心理档案说他几乎无法与同龄孩子交流。难以想象他能如此巧妙地传递秘密。"

"Massive idiot?" "超级大笨蛋？"

"He passed the exams for a rather prestigious high school with a top five score."  
"他以名列前五的成绩通过了相当著名的高中的入学考试。"

"Sex deviant?" "性变态？"

"Kid squirms around girls like they're the plague. Had a panic attack when he got Valentines chocolates in fourth grade from a rather cute girl." Asuka choked town a tinge of jealousy.  
"那孩子一见到女生就躲，好像她们是瘟疫似的。四年级时，一个挺可爱的女生送他情人节巧克力，结果他吓得当场恐慌发作。" 明日香强压下一丝嫉妒说道。

"Oh and then there was that time in junior high when Shinagawa Eriko took him out behind the school gym to confess-"  
"哦，还有初中时，品川惠理子把他拉到学校体育馆后面表白的那次——"

"_Enough_!" Asuka roared, not wanting to hear more about Ikari Shinji's past romantic misadventures.  
"够了！"明日香怒吼道，不想再听关于碇真嗣过去的恋爱糗事。

"_Oh ho oh_! Jealous are we?" Misato commented with a hand over mouth, poorly hiding her massive grin. "You know... psych profiles says the First Child, Rei, is much more compatible with Shinji as a potential mate. We even ran a few scenarios through MAGI on the possibility-"  
"哦呵呵！吃醋了吗？"美里一手捂嘴评论道，勉强掩饰着她那巨大的笑容。"你知道的...心理分析报告显示，第一适格者绫波，与真嗣作为潜在伴侣的匹配度要高得多。我们甚至通过 MAGI 模拟了几种可能性——"

"Shut up. No!" Asuka cringed and fumed at the prospect of mating with that idiot.  
"闭嘴。不可能！"明日香一想到要和那个笨蛋配对就感到厌恶和愤怒。

"Well, it's probably not much a competition considering Rei is still in the infirmary. She got roughed up a bit with the Unit-00 test trials..." Asuka rolled her eyes and continued her criticism of the whole scenario being played out by supposedly the most competent organization to ever exists ever: NERV.  
"嗯，考虑到绫波还在医务室，这比赛估计也没啥看头。她在零号机的测试中受了点伤……" 明日香翻了个白眼，继续批评这个由号称史上最顶尖组织 NERV 上演的整个场景。

"So knowing all this about the kid, you somehow thought that since I may not have arrived in time, _which I did by the way_, you'd use an untested, untrained boy who has as much of a backbone as a jellyfish to pilot a giant bio-organic robot he's never seen or heard before of in his entire life against the greatest threat humankind has ever _faced_?"  
"所以，明知道这孩子的情况，你竟然认为我可能赶不上，顺便说一句我确实赶到了，你就打算用一个未经训练、毫无骨气、对这种他一生中从未见过或听说过的巨型生物机器人一无所知的男孩去对抗人类面临的最大威胁？

"Well, when you put it like that, anything would sound stupid," Misato smoothly replied as she opened the door to the cages.  
"哎，你这么一说，什么听起来都挺蠢的，" 美里一边回应，一边打开了笼子的门。

"That's because _it is_!" Asuka screeched as they entered the cages into the shadow of the great purple humanoid battle system: the Evangelion Unit-01.  
"正是因为如此！" 明日香尖叫着，他们走进了巨大的紫色人形战斗系统——初号机——的阴影笼罩的笼子中。

"We didn't have much of a choice..." Misato looked back at the young red-haired teenager as they walked down the center of the catwalk. "Oh god," Misato moaned as a realization struck her. "Oh god...dammit."  
"我们没有太多选择..." 美里回头看向走在天桥中央的年轻红发少女。"哦，天啊，" 美里突然意识到什么，呻吟道，"哦，天啊...该死。"

"What?" "什么？"

"I'm going to have to tell the Commander his son passed away."  
"我得告诉指挥官，他的儿子去世了。"

"Unfortunate," a voice commented. "But I'm sure the Commander will endure." The owner was a short-haired blonde in a lab coat who carried a strict air of professionalism.  
"不幸啊，"一个声音评论道。"但我相信指挥官会挺过去的。"说话者是一位短发金发、身穿白大褂的女性，她身上散发着一种严谨的专业气息。

"Doctor Akagi," Asuka recognized the face and immediately bowed. Though she had never met her personally, Asuka was immensely respectful towards the famous genius, Akagi Ritsuko, who continued the work of her equally-genius mother, Akagi Naoko, in producing the MAGI supercomputer and the Evangelion development.  
"赤木博士，"明日香认出了这张脸，立刻鞠了一躬。尽管她从未亲自见过赤木律子，但对这位著名的天才——继承了同样才华横溢的母亲赤木直子在制造 MAGI 超级计算机和开发 EVA 方面工作的赤木律子——明日香充满了敬意。

But the comment left a poor first impression on Asuka.  
但这句话给明日香留下了糟糕的第一印象。

"Ritsuko..." Misato muttered. "Look, I know I messed up-"  
"律子……" 惣流低声道，"听着，我知道我搞砸了——"

"You were careless. No matter, we can feel sad about the tragedy later. We have more pressing concerns at hand right now. We have to get Asuka's metrics into Unit-01 and calibrated."  
"你太不小心了。不过，关于这场悲剧我们可以稍后再感伤。眼下我们有更紧迫的事情要处理。我们必须将明日香的同步数据输入到初号机并进行校准。"

Misato sighed and looked over at the young red-haired girl.  
惣流叹了口气，目光转向那位年轻的红发少女。

"You ready to go?" "准备好了吗？"

The Second Child looked up at the giant purple Evangelion Unit-01 before her.  
第二适格者抬头望向她面前那架巨大的紫色 EVA 初号机。

"Yeah," Asuka complied as both older women began making preparations to get Unit-01 operational.  
"嗯，"明日香应声道，两位年长的女性开始准备启动初号机。

"Alright, Unit-01. I heard you're kind of a bitch to work with but so I am..." Asuka's voice trailed off. "But help me this one time," Asuka's voice lowered. "_For that idiot..._"  
"好吧，初号机。听说你挺难伺候的，但我也是..." 明日香的声音渐渐低了下去。"但这次帮我一把，" 明日香压低声音说，"为了那个笨蛋..."

Her eyes glowed with an infernal determination, a insatiable thirst to prove her worth... and a dollop of vengeance for a certain wimpy perverted boy-wonder idiot..  
她的眼中闪烁着地狱般的决心，一种无法满足的证明自己价值的渴望...还有一丝为某个懦弱好色的少年英雄笨蛋复仇的意味。

"Okay, sorry for the lack of plug-suit. It really slipped our minds. Sorry," Ritsuko apologized over the intercom.  
"好吧，抱歉没给你准备插入栓服。我们真的忘了。对不起，" 律子通过内部通讯道歉道。

"It's fine," Asuka muttered as the LCL began filling the entry-plug. Well, I'm never wearing this outfit again, Asuka thought to herself.  
"没关系，" 明日香嘟囔着，随着 LCL 开始充满插入栓。好吧，我再也不穿这套衣服了，明日香暗自想道。

"How come you get to be forgiven for neglecting the plug-suit?" Misato retorted.  
"你怎么就能因为忘了穿驾驶服而被原谅？" 美里反驳道。

"My forgetfulness didn't cost the Commander his only son."  
"我的健忘可没让指挥官失去他唯一的儿子。"

Silence over Rituko's brutally sharp retort.  
里图子尖锐的反驳后是一片沉默。

"It is fine... he was expendable and an unreliable factor," Commander Ikari broke the momentary silence. Asuka noted to herself his cold and distant tone. That comment, much like Dr. Akagi's, left a poor impression on the red-haired demon. "Second Child, I'm sure you're fully aware of what awaits you."  
“没关系……他是个可牺牲且不可靠的因素，”伊卡里指挥官打破了短暂的沉默。明日香注意到他那冷淡而疏远的语气。这句话，和赤木博士的话一样，给这位红发恶魔留下了不好的印象。“第二适格者，我相信你完全明白等待你的是什么。”

"Yes," Asuka affirmed with absolute determination.  
“是的，”明日香坚定地确认道。

"Good, begin the harmonics calibrations and initiation sequences."  
"好的，开始谐波校准和启动序列。"

"Sir, I must insist. The chances of it actually operating, even with Asuka as the pilot, is less than a percent. Unit-01 hasn't actually been operable for years-"  
"长官，我必须坚持。即使由明日香驾驶，它实际运作的可能性也低于百分之一。零号机已经多年无法操作了——"

"We will continue the initiation sequences. We can conduct the preliminary tests later, Dr. Akagi."  
"我们将继续启动序列。我们可以稍后进行初步测试，赤木博士。"

"MAGI predicts a solid forty percent chance of Unit-01 going berserk or potentially self destructing from forced apoptosis," Ritsuko stated.  
"MAGI 预测有高达百分之四十的可能性，初号机会因强制凋亡而暴走或自毁，" 律子陈述道。

"I'm fully aware." "我完全明白。"

"Very well then... Asuka, we're beginning the sequence," Ritsuko's voice sounded worried over the intercom. Heh, Asuka thought. Pre-battle nerves must be hitting everyone hard on the command bridge.  
"那么好吧... 明日香，我们开始执行程序，" 律子的声音通过内部通讯带着担忧。呵，明日香心想。战前的紧张情绪一定让指挥桥上的每个人都倍感压力。

Asuka tuned out the intercom noise as various bridge officers began announcing the initiation and ceasing of sequences. All of which were familiar and memorized by the Second Child, well-equipped in knowledge on the Evangelion unit.  
明日香对舰桥上各种军官开始宣布的启动和停止序列充耳不闻。这些对她来说都已烂熟于心，作为第二适格者，她对 EVA 机体的知识了如指掌。

"Beginning harmonic synchronization sequence."  
“开始谐波同步序列。”

"Increasing power supply to max charge."  
“将电源供应提升至最大充电状态。”

"Cutting first-order restraints in three, two one... first-order restraints restraints cut. Begin cutting second-order restraints..."  
"开始切断一级束缚装置，三、二、一...一级束缚装置已切断。开始切断二级束缚装置..."

So far, nothing out of the ordinary as the mechanical wonder of the world was slowly released from its cage, Asuka thought smugly to herself. She snuggled deep into the seat as she mused to herself if she could get the Evangelion Unit-01 painted her favorite red.  
到目前为止，一切正常，世界上的机械奇迹正慢慢从它的牢笼中释放出来，明日香得意地想。她深深地蜷缩在座位里，暗自思索是否能把初号机涂成她最喜欢的红色。

"Doctor, it seems the Unit-01 is rejecting the pilot," came the reply from bridge bunny, Maya.  
"博士，似乎初号机正在排斥驾驶员，"来自桥上的操作员真希波回答道。

"These synchronization scores are poor... Asuka would be lucky to move a finger."  
"这些同步率太低了...明日香能动动手指就算幸运了。"

"Just give me a second. I'll get Unit-01 skipping in no ti-"  
"稍等一下。我马上就让零号机跳起来，很快就好——"

"Shock wave from surface explosion incoming!"  
"地面爆炸产生的冲击波即将来袭！"

"Wait, what?" Asuka didn't have time to brace herself as she felt the rumble hit her cockpit in full force. She clutched the control-sticks as she felt the wrath of God come in all its fury. She nearly bit her tongue.  
"等等，什么？" 明日香来不及稳住自己，便感受到一股强烈的震动猛烈地撞击了她的驾驶舱。她紧握操纵杆，感受到了神怒的全部威力。她差点咬到自己的舌头。

"_Gah_! Wahhh!" "啊！哇哇哇！"

Asuka opened her eyes and in a brief instant she saw him, Ikari Shinji, falling down before her. Separating them was a pool of LCL, the Evangelion and several meters of air as he fell down along with debris and wreckage.  
明日香睁开眼睛，在那一瞬间，她看到了他，碇真嗣，正从她面前坠落。他们之间隔着一滩 LCL、一台 EVA 以及数米的空气，他随着碎片和残骸一同坠落。

Oh god, Asuka thought. Move damn you, Asuka cursed at Unit-01. _Move_!  
哦天啊，明日香心想。动啊，该死的，明日香对着初号机咒骂道。动起来！

And so it moved. 于是它动了。

In a flash, the remaining restraints where torn from its bolts and sockets. Shinji landed in the palm of the massive Eva Unit-01. The soft metallic membrane mimicking tender fleshy tissue qualities softening his fall while a protective finger shielded him from further dust and debris.  
刹那间，剩余的束缚装置从螺栓和插座中被撕裂。真嗣落入了巨大的初号机手掌中。柔软的金属膜模拟出柔软的肉质特性，缓冲了他的坠落，同时一根保护性的手指为他遮挡了更多的尘埃和碎片。

"An absolute miracle," Ritsuko muttered over the intercom. "It appears your son is alive, Commander Ikari."  
"真是绝对的奇迹，" 律子通过内部通讯低声说道，"看来您的儿子还活着，碇司令。"

"Doctor! Unit-01 is acting on its own!"  
"医生！零号机自己行动起来了！"

"W-what? Impossible!" Asuka watched as she felt the entry-plug eject itself and the massive hand brought near the entry-plug opening.  
"什、什么？不可能！" 明日香看着，感觉到插入栓自行弹出，巨大的手掌靠近了插入栓的开口。

Shinji fell over onto Asuka's lap into the pool of LCL with a splash.  
真嗣一头栽倒在明日香的膝上，溅起一片 LCL 溶液。

"_Garble-garble_! _Garble_..." Shinji held his breath as he struggled on Asuka's lap for air.  
“咕噜咕噜！咕噜……”真嗣憋着气，在明日香的膝上挣扎着寻找空气。

"Breath you idiot..." Asuka commanded in a low voice, unsure to reprimand the idiot buffoon or hug him.  
“呼吸啊，你这个笨蛋……”明日香低声命令道，不知是该斥责这个蠢货还是抱住他。

"Gah! Air!" "啊！空气！"

"LCL actually," Asuka corrected. "You know a type of direct-blood oxygen delivery fluid."  
"其实是 LCL，" 明日香纠正道，"你知道的，一种直接血液供氧的液体。"

"How can I-" "我怎么可能——"

"LCL brings oxygen directly to your lungs. Weren't you listening? Whatever. Can you get off my lap now?"  
"LCL 直接将氧气输送到你的肺部。你没在听吗？算了。你现在能从我腿上下来了吗？"

Shinji leaped from Asuka's comfortable lap like it was a heated rock.  
真嗣像是从一块滚烫的石头上跳开一样，迅速离开了明日香舒适的腿。

"Asuka... were you crying?" Shinji boldly inquired.  
"明日香……你刚才在哭吗？" 真嗣大胆地询问道。

"What?" Asuka realized droplets of salty liquid was forming on the edges of her eyes which she quickly wiped away. "No! Just sleepy... you know how it is. Busy and all that."  
"什么？" 明日香意识到眼角正形成咸咸的液体，她迅速擦掉了。"不！只是困了...你知道的，忙得不可开交。

"Oh. Sorry," came Shinji's flat reply. "You should get some sleep when you can," Shini suggested.  
""哦。对不起，" 真嗣平淡地回答。"你应该趁能睡的时候多睡会儿，" 真嗣建议道。

"Whatever, idiot. How the hell did you survive that fall down the bottomless pit anyways?"  
"随便吧，傻瓜。你到底是怎么从那无底深渊摔下去还活下来的？

"Oh, turns out I landed a rather large mountain of moldy stuffed NERV-limited-edition teddy bears and rolled down some ventilation shaft. Followed it around until an earthquake knocked me down. Then I fell into this robot's hand-"  
"哦，原来我掉进了一大堆发霉的 NERV 限量版泰迪熊堆里，还滚进了一个通风管道。跟着管道转了几圈，结果地震一来就把我震下去了。然后我就掉进了这个机器人的手里——"

"Excuse me?" "劳驾？"

"What?" "什么？"

"You mean I caught you."  
"你是说我救了你。"

"I guess-Oh never mind. Sorry. Yes, then you caught me, and then you put me into this LCL room-"  
"我想是的——哦，算了。对不起。是的，然后你救了我，接着你把我放进了这个 LCL 室——"

"No I didn't," Asuka puffed.  
"不，我没有，" 明日香鼓起腮帮子说道。

"Then how did the giant robot you appear to piloting put me into this LCL room-place-thingy?"  
"那你怎么解释那个似乎由你驾驶的巨型机器人把我弄进了这个 LCL 房间之类的地方？"

"Not me," Asuka shrugged.  
"不是我，" 明日香耸了耸肩。

Then, chatter from the command bridge filled the entry-plug as it was re-inserted into Eva Unit-01.  
随后，指挥桥的嘈杂声充斥着插入栓，因为它被重新插入到初号机中。

"Doctor...," Maya began in amazement as her voice filled the LCL room. "Asuka's synch scores shot up from two points to eighty-five for an instant. In addition, with Ikari Shinji in there now... it seems Unit-01 is stabilizing Asuka's synch rate at seventy points."  
"“博士...”，玛雅惊讶地开口，她的声音充满了 LCL 室。“明日香的同步得分从两点瞬间飙升至八十五点。此外，现在碇真嗣也在里面...似乎初号机正在将明日香的同步率稳定在七十点。””

"Maya, use the modified Dummy Plug interface for twin pilot synchronization and calibration. Have Asuka as primary pilot with Shinji as secondary pilot. With this... Unit-01 might actually start moving."  
"“玛雅，使用改良的 Dummy Plug 接口进行双驾驶员同步和校准。让明日香作为主驾驶员，真嗣作为副驾驶员。这样一来...初号机可能真的会开始移动。””

"Duo-piloting, Ritsuko? Are you mad?" Misato interjected.  
"双人驾驶，律子？你疯了吗？" 美里插话道。

"It's stabilizing Asuka's synch rate with Unit-01. So unless you can get Unit-01 to behave or fly Unit-02 from Germany within two minutes, this is the best shot we have."  
"这是为了稳定明日香与初号机的同步率。除非你能让初号机听话，或者在两分钟内从德国飞来二号机，否则这是我们最好的机会。"

"I-I... this..." "我...这..."

"It appears," Commander Ikari interjected in the argument between the two senior bridge officers. "That the reserve pilot, Ikari Shinji, may have some use. Move Eva Unit-01 to the catapult. Prepare for sortie."  
"看来，" 伊卡里指挥官在两位资深舰桥军官的争论中插话道，"备用驾驶员，碇真嗣，或许能派上用场。将 EVA 初号机移至弹射器，准备出击。"

"But sir your son-" Misato attempted to protest.  
"但是，指挥官，那是您的儿子——" 美里试图抗议。

"Will do well to learn firsthand how to pilot an Eva," Commander Ikari finished.  
"亲自体验驾驶 EVA，对他来说是个不错的学习机会，" 伊卡里指挥官结束了对话。

"Asuka, hand Shinji the spare neural clips. We haven't got much time," Ritsuko ordered.  
"明日香，把备用神经连接器递给真嗣。我们时间不多了，" 律子命令道。

"The Angel is directly above the Geofront. We're deploying you guys now," Misato added.  
"使徒就在 Geofront 正上方。我们现在就要部署你们了，" 美里补充道。

"Affirmative... Here, put these on, idiot," Asuka plucked a hair of identical white neural clips like the ones she was currently wearing from the side compartment. "You're about to see me do work."  
"收到... 来，戴上这个，笨蛋，" 明日香从侧边隔间里抽出一束与她现在佩戴的一模一样的白色神经连接器。"你马上就要见识到我的厉害了。"

"D-do work? You mean you're piloting the giant robot?"  
"要启动吗？你是说你在驾驶那个巨型机器人？"

"Precisely, idiot," Asuka said. "Ugh, this is cramped. Here," Asuka said as she got out of her seat and moved to the side.  
"没错，笨蛋，" 明日香说道，"呃，这里真挤。来，" 她一边说一边从座位上站起来，挪到一边。

"Sit," came her stiff command.  
"坐下，" 她生硬地命令道。

"W-what?" "什...什么？"

"Do you want to get tossed around like a rag-doll? Sit on the seat and I'll sit on you," Asuka explained averting her gaze from Shinji's.  
"你想被甩得像破布娃娃一样吗？坐到座位上，我来坐你身上，" 明日香解释道，同时避开真嗣的目光。

"O-oh. O-okay. S-sorry for being a bother," Shinji apologized as he lowered himself onto the seat.  
"哦...哦。好...好的。对...对不起，给你添麻烦了，" 真嗣边道歉边坐到座位上。

"It's n-not like you're that m-much of a b-bother," Asuka nervously replied as she brought herself onto Shinji's lap.  
"其实你也没那么烦人，" 明日香紧张地回答着，一边坐到了真嗣的腿上。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"Stop apologizing, dork," Asuka ordered as she fastened the restraints over herself and Shinji. "And I swear if you get a hard-on with me on your lap...I'll..."  
"别道歉了，傻瓜，" 明日香命令道，同时给自己和真嗣扣上了安全带。"你要是敢在我坐你腿上时起反应...我就..."

Shinji got the hint. "Yes ma'am."  
真嗣领会了暗示。“是的，女士。”

"Good boy," Asuka grinned as she felt the Unit-01 finished being moved to the catapult.  
“好孩子，”明日香咧嘴一笑，感觉到零号机已经完成了向弹射器的移动。

"Yeah, Shinji," Misato concurred through the intercom. "Best leave the wife to do the work. This also applies in bed!" Misato added jokingly.  
“没错，真嗣，”美里通过内部通讯表示同意。“最好让妻子来做这些工作。这也适用于床上！”美里开玩笑地补充道。

"_Misato_!" Asuka raged as she and Shinji both blushed a soft crimson.  
"美里！" 明日香怒气冲冲地说道，她和真嗣都脸颊泛起了淡淡的绯红。

"Knock 'em dead, Asuka," Misato encouraged, ignoring her earlier comment and the Second Child's rage. "You too Shinji. Sorry for not picking you up on time. If you come out of this alive, I'll even throw in a big smooch for ya."  
"加油，明日香，" 美里鼓励道，对刚才的评论和第二适格者的怒气置若罔闻。"真嗣也是。抱歉没准时来接你们。如果你们能平安归来，我还会额外送你们一个大大的吻。"

"_Mi-sa-to_!" A flustered Asuka shouted over the intercom. "That's completely inappropri-"  
"美—里—！" 明日香通过内部通讯器气急败坏地喊道。"那实在是太不—"

"_Launch the Eva_!" "启动 Eva！"

Asuka nearly bit her tongue.  
明日香差点咬到自己的舌头。

---

"The Angel doesn't look so scary in this giant mech thing..." Shinji commented as his arms tightened around Asuka's slim waist.  
"在这个巨型机甲里，使徒看起来也没那么可怕了……" 真嗣评论道，同时双臂紧紧环抱住明日香纤细的腰肢。

The Angel stood there passively, almost in wonder, of the being before it now. Only a few blocks was all that stood in between them.  
天使静静地站在那里，几乎带着惊奇，注视着眼前这个存在。仅有的几块障碍物横亘在他们之间。

"Heh. Damn straight," Asuka growled as she began flexing both hers and the Eva Unit-01's massive arms. There were so many kinks and joints to crack in this rusty old thing... "Hold on tight, boy-wonder. You're about to see an ace pilot-_Wah_!"  
"“哼，说得好！”明日香低吼着，开始活动她和初号机巨大的双臂。这锈迹斑斑的老家伙关节和肌肉真多，得好好舒展一下……“抓紧了，小子，你马上就要见识到王牌驾驶员的风采了——哇！””

Shinji had did just as told, startling the red demon.  
真嗣按照吩咐做了，让那红色恶魔吃了一惊。

"No so tight, idiot..." Asuka whimpered softly.  
"别那么紧，笨蛋……" 明日香轻声呜咽道。

"S-sorry." "对-对不起。"

"The umbilical cable is locked in. Power supply looks good. Alright you two, go get 'em!" Misato ordered.  
"脐带电缆已锁定。电源供应正常。好了，你们两个，去吧！" 美里命令道。

"Alright," Asuka agreed having regained her composure. "Brace yourself... _Asuka is coming_!"  
"好的，" 明日香恢复了镇定，同意道，"做好准备...明日香来了！"

"_Gah-Wah-Ahhh_!" Shinji cried as Asuka flung the massive Eva Unit-01 across the battlefield, closing few city blocks that separated themselves and the Angel.  
"啊——哇——啊！" 真嗣大叫着，因为明日香将巨大的 Eva 初号机猛地甩过战场，缩短了他们与使徒之间相隔的几个街区。

Shinji could barely keep his eyes opened during the fight. Asuka was moving Unit-01 at blindingly fast speed dodging the empowered tendrils from the Angel's arms while returning attacks of her own. Had his eyes been opened, he would have realized Asuka maneuvered the Eva with a magnificent grace, ducking through buildings and terrain. Asuka dodged every blow the Angel threw and when the opening presented itself, she punched right back.  
战斗中，真嗣几乎睁不开眼睛。明日香操控着初号机以极快的速度躲避使徒手臂中增强的触须，同时发起反击。如果他能睁开眼睛，就会意识到明日香操纵 Eva 的动作是多么优雅，穿梭于建筑和地形之间。明日香躲开了使徒的每一次攻击，当机会出现时，她立刻予以还击。

And the strangest part was, Shinji felt a strange pressure on his knuckles every time Asuka landed a punch, as if it he himself were punching the monster...  
而最奇怪的是，每当明日香出拳击中时，真嗣感到自己的指关节上有一股奇怪的压力，仿佛是他自己在击打那怪物……

Asuka was visibly panting on Shinji's lap as she began to catch her breath.  
明日香明显地喘着气坐在真嗣的腿上，开始调整呼吸。

"Dammit Unit-01. It's a been rough around the edges. Like it hasn't exercised in _years_."  
该死的初号机，真是粗糙不堪，就像多年未曾锻炼过一样。

"It has been in cold storage for nearly a decade," Ritsuko commented. "Some of the joints may still be a tad frozen but..."  
"它已经在冷库中存放了近十年，" 律子评论道，"有些关节可能还有点僵硬，但……"

"Whatever," Asuka panted. "I'll break that Angel in two... How you holding up, idiot?" Asuka turned her attention towards her unwitting pilot-partner.  
"无所谓，" 明日香喘着气说，"我会把那个使徒撕成两半的……你怎么样，笨蛋？" 明日香将注意力转向她那不知不觉中的驾驶员搭档。

"I feel weird... every time you land a punch I feel it too..."  
"我感觉很奇怪……每次你出拳，我也能感觉到……"

"Heh, you feel everything the Eva does," Asuka said turning around to back, seeing mortified Shinji. "Don't worry about it, idiot. Nothing's going to happ-"  
"呵呵，你感受到 Eva 的一切，"明日香转过身来，看到惊恐的碇真嗣。"别担心，傻瓜。什么都不会发生的——"

"Asuka! Watch out!" Shinji exclaimed pointing back to the front.  
"明日香！小心！" 碇真嗣指着前方喊道。

"What? _Shi_-!" Asuka winced as the left arm of Unit-01 was caught in a vice grip of the Angel. The sudden burst of speed from the formerly sluggish beast caught Asuka off guard and now the Angel was in the process if twisting the arm to have a second elbow. But whereas Asuka winced through the intense pain, Shinji screamed.  
"什么？啊——！" 明日香痛得皱眉，因为初号机的左臂被使徒紧紧抓住。原本迟缓的怪物突然加速，让明日香措手不及，现在使徒正在扭曲手臂，使其长出第二个肘部。尽管明日香强忍着剧痛，碇真嗣却尖叫起来。

"Reduce the synch threshold, reduce the pain synaptic for both pilots!" Ritsuko ordered.  
"降低同步阈值，减少两位驾驶员的疼痛突触！" 律子命令道。

"Negative," Commander Ikari intervened. "Transfer all pain synaptic messages towards the secondary pilot, Ikari Shinji. Allow the Second Child to fight without fear of pain."  
"否定，" 碇司令介入道。"将所有疼痛突触信息转移给次级驾驶员，碇真嗣。让第二适格者无需畏惧疼痛地战斗。"

"B-but sir! If Asuka doesn't feel the pain synapses, it'll dull her instinctual ability to anticipate enemy movement."  
"但是，长官！如果明日香感受不到疼痛突触，这会削弱她本能预测敌人动作的能力。"

"I'm fully aware, but with the handicap of having two pilots as it is, we best use our advantages to its fullest," Commander Ikari said without a pause. "A beast without fear of pain is more dangerous than a beast weighed down by dead meat."  
"我很清楚，但既然我们已经有两位驾驶员，就应该充分利用这一优势。" 伊卡里指挥官毫不犹豫地说道，"一头无所畏惧疼痛的野兽，比一头背负着死肉的野兽更为危险。

Asuka winced again, but not in pain. That comment was cold, even for Asuka, for the Commander to refer to his own son.  
明日香再次皱眉，却非因疼痛。那句话冷酷至极，即便是对指挥官来说，用这样的言辞提及自己的儿子也太过分了。

Shinji himself now was more silent than before. With his eyes closed he, was too focused holding down his tongue to notice.  
此时，真嗣比以往更加沉默。他闭着眼睛，全神贯注地压抑着自己的情绪，以至于未曾察觉。

_I can't distract Asuka. Have to be as quiet as possible...  
我无法分散明日香的注意力。必须尽可能保持安静..._

Asuka blinked. A voice flooded her head but it was not through her ears. It felt as if she was directly communicating with someone close... Someone whom she was sitting on the lap of.  
明日香眨了眨眼。一个声音涌入她的脑海，但并非通过耳朵传来。感觉就像她在直接与某人交流...某个她正坐在其膝上的人。

"Thanks, idiot," Asuka muttered.  
“谢了，笨蛋，”明日香低声嘟囔道。

Shinji opened an eye,"F-for what?"  
真嗣睁开一只眼，“为……为什么？”

"Pain synapse transfer complete. All pain transmissions going towards secondary pilot, Ikari Shinji."  
痛觉神经传递完成。所有痛觉信号正传输给第二驾驶员，碇真嗣。

And with that, Shinji unleashed a massive roar of pain.  
随着这句话，真嗣发出了一声巨大的痛苦咆哮。

_Argh! The pain... The pain! It hurts. IT HURTS!  
啊！好痛...好痛！太疼了。太疼了！_

"Just hold out a little bit, Shinji..." Asuka whispered as she brought the Eva's right arm to bear onto the Angel's face.  
"坚持一下，真嗣..." 明日香低声说着，将 Eva 的右臂对准了使徒的脸部。

One punch. Two punch. Twenty punches later and the Angel's grip would not loosen. It held on with a tenacious fury like two atoms bound with absolute lowest energy. This was now a contest between Shinji's and the Angel's tolerance for pain and punishment.  
"一拳。两拳。二十拳过后，使徒的抓握依旧没有松懈。它以一种顽强的狂怒紧紧抓住，就像两个原子以最低能量结合在一起。现在，这是真嗣和使徒之间忍耐痛苦与惩罚的较量。

"Goddammit! Let go you goddamn thing!" Asuka did not feel a new surge of liberty in her piloting ability as the Commander predicted. If anything, she fought without pause or objective other than to have Unit-01 suffer as little as possible.  
"该死的！放开，你这该死的东西！" 明日香并没有像指挥官预料的那样感受到驾驶能力的全新提升。相反，她只是不停地战斗，除了尽可能减少对零号机的伤害外，没有任何其他目标。

"Since every goddamn hit this Eva takes, Shinji feels..." Asuka muttered to herself.  
"因为这台 Eva 受到的每一次攻击，真嗣都能感受到……" 明日香自言自语道。

Then the Angel finally scored a minor victory and gave Eva Unit-01 a second joint on the arm. The arm cracked below the elbow and above the wrist, shattering the armor and revealing a mesh of vein and shattered bio-synthetic flesh.  
最终，使徒取得了小小的胜利，在 Eva 零号机的手臂上制造了第二个关节。手臂在肘部和手腕之间断裂，装甲碎裂，露出了交织的血管和破碎的生物合成肌肉。

_ARGH! It hurts. IT HURTS! IT HURST SO DAMN MUCH!  
啊！好痛。好痛啊！痛得要命！  
_

No audible sounds could be heard from the entry-plug cockpit but Asuka knew precisely how Shinji felt. He was being quiet to avoid distracting her. He was tolerating all this pain involuntarily so she could fight unhindered. He took the full brunt of pain from the broken arm for her. Heh, Asuka thought to herself. He's not so wimpy after all...  
插入栓驾驶舱内没有传出任何声音，但明日香清楚地知道真嗣的感受。他保持沉默，以免分散她的注意力。他无意识地忍受着这一切痛苦，以便她能不受阻碍地战斗。他为了她承受了断臂的全部痛苦。呵呵，明日香心想。他其实也没那么软弱嘛……

But that didn't mean she could lax in this fight.  
但这并不意味着她可以在这场战斗中松懈。

_"_Sir! Secondary pilot Ikari is beginning to phase in and out of consciousness! The shock is causing him to red out!"  
"长官！副驾驶员碇真嗣开始出现意识时隐时现的情况！冲击导致他出现红视现象！"

"Asuka! Pull back! The UN is going in with close air support!" Misato roared over the intercom.  
"明日香！撤退！联合国正派遣近距离空中支援进入战场！" 美里通过内部通讯咆哮道。

"What? Alright, got it." Asuka finally managed to slip away from the Angel's grip and retreat a farther distance away as the UN-JSSDF forces began a diversionary assault to occupy the Angel. A massive number of bombs and ordinance were dropped as jets screeched across the air unleashing hellish payloads and devastating gifts of fire and incendiary ammunition to divert the Angel's attention. Positioning the Eva behind a blast shield, Asuka turned her attention to her partner-pilot.  
"什么？好的，明白了。" 明日香终于从使徒的束缚中挣脱出来，撤退到更远的距离。与此同时，联合国-日本自卫队联合部队开始进行牵制性攻击，以吸引使徒的注意力。大量炸弹和弹药被投下，战机在空中尖啸，释放出地狱般的载荷和毁灭性的火焰及燃烧弹，以转移使徒的注意力。明日香将 EVA 置于爆炸掩体后，转而关注她的搭档驾驶员。

"Come on idiot, stay with me..." Asuka undid the harness that bound both her and Shinji to the cockpit and brought a warm hand to Shinji's cold face, flushed with pain and agony. "Come on... hold out," Asuka whispered as we saw Shinji wince with pain to even the slightest touch.  
"快点，笨蛋，坚持住……" 明日香解开了将她和真嗣束缚在驾驶舱的束缚带，用温暖的手抚摸着真嗣因痛苦而冰冷的脸颊。"坚持住……" 明日香低声说道，我们看到真嗣因最轻微的触碰而痛苦地皱眉。

"That kid just had his arm broken..." Misato commented softly.  
"那孩子刚断了手臂……" 美里轻声评论道。

"If the secondary pilot passes out?" Commander Ikari inquired without a shred of sympathy.  
"如果副驾驶员昏迷了怎么办？" 碇源堂司令询问道，语气中没有一丝同情。

"Then the secondary pilot may suffer a mental backlash and Unit-01 will cease functioning until we reroute pain synapses to the primary pilot. MAGI predicts a month-to-three-year-long coma for the secondary pilot the most likely outcome should this continue," Ritsuko answered.  
"那么副驾驶员可能会遭受精神反冲，Unit-01 将停止运作，直到我们将痛觉神经重新导向至主驾驶员。MAGI 预测，如果这种情况持续下去，副驾驶员最有可能陷入一个月至三年的昏迷状态。" 律子回答道。

"Those consequences are acceptable," was the Commander's response.  
"这些后果是可以接受的，" 指挥官回应道。

"What are your orders?" Ritsuko grimaced.  
"您的命令是什么？" 律子皱眉问道。

"Keep the pain synapses on secondary pilot Ikari Shinji until he does pass out. Then switch it to the Second Child immediately afterwards to resume functional operations for the Eva Unit-01."  
"保持疼痛神经连接在第二驾驶员碇真嗣身上，直到他昏迷。之后立即切换到第二适格者，以恢复 Eva 初号机的正常运作。"

_Have to... stay awake... Have to... keep Asuka away from this... pain...  
必须...保持清醒...必须...让明日香远离这种...痛苦..._

Asuka's eyes were full of concern and worry.  
明日香的眼中充满了关切和忧虑。

"Second Child," the voice of Commander Ikari flooded the cockpit. "The UN air bombardment is almost over, prepare for sortie again."  
"第二适格者，"伊卡洛斯司令的声音充满了驾驶舱。"联合国空袭即将结束，准备再次出击。"

"Yes sir," Asuka said with determination as she returned to Shinji's lap and readjusting the harness. "I'll finish this quick."  
"遵命，"明日香坚定地回答，她回到真嗣的腿上，重新调整了安全带。"我会迅速解决的。"

"Make it so," came the Commander's command of fortune without a hint of warmth.  
"那就这么做吧，"司令下达了命令，语气中没有一丝温度。

And with that, Asuka roared back into fight across the burning city that was her battleground.  
就这样，明日香咆哮着再次投入战斗，穿越那座熊熊燃烧的城市，那里是她的战场。

And she was met with an empowered tendril to the eye of Unit-01.  
而迎接她的，是强化后的触手，直击零号机的眼睛。

Perhaps it was the over-eagerness in finishing this quickly that allowed the opening. Maybe it was the frustration of the situation or the hope that the Angel would have been preoccupied with the sudden display of firepower from the UN air support. But in any case, what occurred had occurred and Asuka could only blame herself.  
或许是急于速战速决的心态导致了这一破绽。也许是局势的压抑或是希望天使被联合国空中支援的突然火力展示所牵制。但无论如何，事情已经发生，明日香只能自责。

But of course, she didn't scream. After all, she felt no pain from the Eva's actions. No repercussions for however reckless Asuka chose to fight.  
但当然，她没有尖叫。毕竟，她没有因为 Eva 的行动感到任何痛苦。无论明日香选择多么鲁莽地战斗，都没有任何后果。

Shinji, however, did feel the pain.  
然而，真嗣确实感受到了痛苦。

And scream he did.  
他确实尖叫了。

---

"Shinji! You idiot come on... wake up..."  
"真嗣！你这个笨蛋，快醒醒……"

Asuka had unfastened the harness and was now a top the young boy. His eyes were closed and a small trickle of blood floating in emulsion within the LCL hovered above his nostril. His heart beat was sound but he wouldn't wake up. The boy would not speak to her and she could no longer hear the thoughts in his head.  
明日香已经解开了安全带，现在正趴在那个少年身上。他的眼睛紧闭，一小股血迹在 LCL 液体中悬浮，漂浮在他的鼻孔上方。他的心跳声清晰可闻，但他就是不醒。这个男孩不再对她说话，她也无法再听到他脑海中的思绪。

Asuka felt something strange... something she hadn't felt in years... not since she found her mothers corpse...  
明日香感觉到一种奇怪的东西……一种她已经多年未曾感受到的东西……自从她发现母亲的尸体以来……

_Fear_.

Her worst fears had been realized. The situation was... desperate. Ikari Shinji had suffered a red out and mental backlash from the pain synaptic overload. At best, he was unconscious and at worst... a coma that would span months to years.  
她最深的恐惧成真了。情况是……绝望的。碇真嗣遭受了红色警报和因疼痛突触过载引起的精神反冲。最好的情况是他昏迷不醒，最坏的情况……则是陷入长达数月甚至数年的昏迷。

And here, Asuka believed, that slapping his face a few times would wake him up.  
而在这里，明日香以为，拍打他的脸几次就能让他醒来。

"Wake up, idiot! Don't leave me! You boring idiot-deviant-ugh," Asuka twisted her tongue struggling to find insults. "_Stooge_!"  
“醒醒，笨蛋！别丢下我！你这个无聊的笨蛋-变态-呃，”明日香努力寻找着侮辱的词汇，舌头打结。“马屁精！”

"Asuka! Asuka! Can you read me?" Asuka sighed towards the static of black-and-white screen. Yes, I can hear you but...  
"“明日香！明日香！你能听到我吗？”明日香对着黑白屏幕上的静电噪音叹了口气。是的，我能听见你，但是……”

"We still can't get a visual or audio feed on the entry-plug! Last moments of recordings suggest Ikari passed out from the excessive pain."  
“我们仍然无法获取插入栓内的视频或音频信号！最后的录音显示，碇因为剧痛已经昏迷。”

"Goddammit. Asuka!" “该死。明日香！”

"She can't send out messages. Misato, that's enough. The Angel's piercing attack through Unit-01's eye socket and cranium crippled the output relay feed. She can't communicate with the command bridge."  
"她无法发送消息。美里，够了。使徒通过初号机的眼窝和颅骨进行的穿透攻击破坏了输出中继馈线。她无法与指挥桥通信。"

"But can she hear us?"  
"但她能听见我们吗？"

"Most likely. However, since the command feed has been FUBAR'd... we can't switch the synapses from Ikari to Asuka... meaning..."  
"很可能。然而，由于指挥馈线已经完全瘫痪...我们无法将神经连接从碇切换到明日香...这意味着..."

The horror was keenly etched into Misato's voice.  
恐惧深深地刻在美里的话语中。

"The Eva's dead in the water..."  
初号机已经动弹不得了……

Asuka was panicking. All her training in the NERV-Branch Germany had never prepared her for a situation like this. A pilot was usually a solo job, but there would always be the support of the command bridge. But here, the command bridge could only guess at what she was doing and with a half-dead body in the entry-plug with her the situation appeared...desperate.  
明日香慌了神。她在德国 NERV 分部的所有训练，从未为她准备过这样的局面。通常，驾驶员的工作是单打独斗，但总有指挥桥的支持。然而现在，指挥桥只能猜测她的行动，而插入栓内还有半死不活的同伴，情况显得……绝望。

"Eva Unit-01 is not moving. It's lost ten percent of its bio-fluid. The automated coagulation systems are keeping it from bleeding to death. Umbilical cable power supply is still stable..." Maya began ticking off a list through the intercom.  
"Eva 初号机没有动静。它的生物液损失了百分之十。自动凝血系统正在阻止它失血过多。脐带电缆的电源供应仍然稳定..." 玛雅通过内部通讯开始逐一报告情况。

"And yet, the Eva still does not move," interjected Commander Ikari.  
"然而，Eva 仍然没有动作," 伊卡洛斯指挥官插话道。

"At this time, sir, I recommend emergency retrieval of the Eva Unit-01 and conducting hasty repairs," Misato recommended.  
"此时，长官，我建议紧急回收 Eva 初号机并进行快速修复," 美里建议道。

"That won't be necessary, Captain. I have faith that Pilot Soryu will come through for us... Request the UN to commence a second wave of close air support."  
"那就不必了，队长。我相信飞行员 Soryu 会为我们挺身而出...请求联合国开始第二波近距离空中支援。"

"Sir, MAGI predicts UN air support would only buy us another thirty seconds before the Angel wipes out the remaining bomber squadrons," Ritsuko advised.  
"长官，MAGI 预测联合国的空中支援只能为我们争取到再过三十秒，之后天使就会消灭剩余的轰炸机中队，" 律子建议道。

"Enough time for Pilot Soryu to think of something. Commence close air support."  
"足够让飞行员 Soryu 想出对策了。开始近距离空中支援。"

Asuka held tightly onto Shinji as she braced both of them for the coming onslaught. The young red-haired pilot knew she had to take this opportunity and think... think through the shock waves of explosions and destructive force being unleashed only a few miles away from her Evangelion.  
明日香紧紧抓住真嗣，为即将到来的冲击做好准备。这位年轻的红发驾驶员知道，她必须抓住这个机会，思考……在几英里外爆炸和破坏力释放的冲击波中思考，这些冲击波正向她的福音战士袭来。

"Asuka. This is Ritsuko. If you can hear me, you have to open up the user-interface and manually switch the synapses from Shinji to yourself. The Eva won't operate unless the synapses are being received by a conscious pilot."  
“明日香，我是律子。如果你能听到我，你必须打开用户界面，手动将神经连接从真嗣切换到你自己。除非有意识的驾驶员接收神经连接，否则福音战士将无法运作。”

"Argh! Don't you think I've tried that? _Goddammit_!" Asuka cursed. For whatever reason, Unit-01 was rejecting any input commands from the cockpit. In her frustration, Asuka tightened her hold on Shinji.  
“啊！你以为我没试过吗？该死！”明日香咒骂道。不知为何，零号机拒绝接受驾驶舱的任何输入指令。在沮丧中，明日香更加用力地抓住了真嗣。

"I'm sorry, idiot," Asuka apologized, realizing the irony of apologizing to Lord-Shinji-of-the-Apologies. "Guess this was a crappy demonstration of my piloting skills..."  
"对不起，傻瓜，" 明日香道歉道，意识到向道歉大王真嗣道歉的讽刺意味。"看来这次展示我的驾驶技术真是糟糕透了……"

"Well, it's not _so_ bad," a soft voice giggled behind her. Asuka's grip on Shinji tightened before she looked at origin of the voice.  
"其实也没那么糟，" 一个柔和的声音在她身后轻笑。明日香紧握着真嗣的手，然后才看向声音的来源。

And Asuka looked in wonder.  
明日香惊讶地望去。

"Y-you're..." Impossible, Asuka thought to herself. She should be dead... even if she were alive she must have aged...  
"你……" 不可能，明日香暗自思忖。她应该已经死了……即便活着，也必定老去了……

But yet there she was, the mother of Ikari Shinji, floating in the middle of the cockpit as beautiful as the aged photo Asuka first glimpsed at her in.  
然而，她就那样出现在那里，碇真嗣的母亲，如同明日香初次在一张泛黄的照片中瞥见她时一样美丽，漂浮在驾驶舱中央。

Asuka, by instinct and curiosity, reached out to touch her...and felt nothing but the emptiness of LCL.  
出于本能和好奇，明日香伸手去触摸她……却只感受到 LCL 的空虚。

"Ah! Sorry!" The woman clasped her hands in apology. "I'm kind of in my ghost form so this is a hologram? Sort of?"  
"啊！对不起！" 女人双手合十表示歉意。"我现在是以幽灵形态出现，所以这是全息影像？算是吧？"

"You're t-the idiot's m-mother..." Asuka stammered.  
"你、你是那个笨蛋的母亲..." 明日香结巴地说道。

"In the flesh! Well, not really... Don't tell him about the I'm-stuck-possessing-Unit-01-thing-though. It'd freak him out quite a bit."  
"正是本人！好吧，也不完全是...别告诉他我被困在初号机里的事。那会让他很害怕的。"

"Look. This is a great fantastic revelation and all, Mrs. Ikari," Asuka rushed coddling the unconscious boy in her arms, "but there's kind of an Angel out there..."  
"看，这确实是个了不起的发现，碇夫人，" 明日香急忙抱着怀中昏迷的男孩，"但外面还有个使徒……"

"Oh that... I'll take care of it. You just watch my little sweetheart for me... _my dear future daughter-in-law_," Shinji's mother winked.  
"哦，那个啊...我来处理。你只需帮我照看我的小宝贝...我亲爱的未来儿媳，" 真嗣的母亲眨了眨眼。

"W-what? W-we're not l-like that!"  
"什、什么？我们、我们不是那种关系！"

"And for future reference, it's either _mother_ or _Yui_!" The woman cheered as Asuka clung tightly to Shinji. She felt Unit-01 begin moving on its own preparing for an epic charge against the Angel, fresh and unfazed from an otherwise brutally sustained series of air strikes.  
"为了将来参考，要么叫母亲，要么叫唯！" 女子欢呼着，此时明日香紧紧抱住真嗣。她感觉到初号机开始自行移动，准备对使徒发起一场史诗般的冲锋，尽管刚刚经历了一系列残酷的空袭，却依旧精神抖擞，毫发无损。

The shocked red-haired pilot didn't even have time to come up with a curt reply.  
震惊的红发驾驶员甚至来不及给出一句简短的回应。

Evangelion Unit-01 had gone berserk.  
福音战士初号机已经狂暴化了。

The fury of humankind surged through the wires and veins of the bio-synthetic combat system Evangelion Unit-01. There was a rush of adrenaline, the marvel of miracles and the thunderous power in the machine. Nothing could withstand its unhindered might. The once broken arm had been mended and reformed. Eva Unit-01 fought with strength thought unfathomable moments ago.  
人类的怒火在生物合成战斗系统 Evangelion Unit-01 的线路与脉络中汹涌澎湃。一股肾上腺素激增，奇迹般的壮丽与机器中的雷霆之力。没有什么能够抵挡其无阻的威力。曾经断裂的手臂已被修复重塑。Eva Unit-01 以片刻前难以想象的强大力量战斗着。

Here came the wrath of Man in all its fury.  
人类的愤怒以全部的狂怒降临于此。

And Asuka finally bit her tongue  
而明日香终于咬住了自己的舌头

---

It was over. 结束了。

"Ow! ow! ow..." Asuka was rubbing her cheek. Her tongue still sore from being bitten.  
“哎哟！哎哟！哎哟……”明日香揉着脸颊，她的舌头因为被咬而仍然疼痛。

The fight had lasted barely a minute and Unit-01 had cease operations. The Angel's core was destroyed with a piece of hardened bone ripped from the monster's own rib cage. After a climatic explosion, Evangelion Unit-01 walked out of the blazing inferno and took pause.  
战斗仅持续了不到一分钟，零号机便停止了运作。天使的核心被从怪物自己的肋骨上撕下的一块硬化骨头摧毁。在一阵剧烈的爆炸后，初号机从熊熊烈火中走出，停下了脚步。

The pair of pilots were now awaiting to be picked up by NERV personnel. Ikari Yui, the strangely eccentric mother of Shinji Ikari, had vanished with a simple "Ta ta for now, my beloved _daughter-in-law_!"  
两位飞行员此刻正等待着 NERV 人员的接应。碇源堂的古怪母亲，碇真嗣的奇怪母亲，留下一句“暂别了，我亲爱的儿媳妇！”便神秘消失了。

"That's not the last I'm going to see of her", Asuka prophetically muttered to herself.  
“我还会再见到她的”，明日香预言般地自言自语道。

Though she wasn't entirely displeased by Yui's title for Asuka...  
尽管她对绫波丽给明日香起的称呼并不完全反感……

Shaking her head, Asuka looked down at the boy she was nursing. In the fiery red-head's arms, Asuka was cradling the aforementioned Ikari Shinji like a newborn baby with his head resting gently on her rather disappointing bosom.  
摇了摇头，明日香低头看着她正在照顾的男孩。在火红头发的少女怀中，明日香像抱着新生儿一样抱着前面提到的碇真嗣，他的头轻轻地靠在她那令人失望的胸前。

"Idiot's kind of cute when he's not apologizing..." Asuka commented on the sight, then blushed red when she realized her comment. "T-then again anyone looks cute when they're asleep and in _my_ arms... and not apologizing over every little thing..." _...Right_?  
“这家伙在不道歉的时候还挺可爱的……”明日香评论着眼前的景象，然后意识到自己的话后脸红了。“再说了，任何人在睡着并在我怀里时……而且不是为每件小事道歉时……都挺可爱的……对吧？”

But as cute as the idiot was in her arms, Asuka realized the young boy could be in a coma for months or years.  
尽管这个傻瓜在她怀里很可爱，明日香意识到这个年轻男孩可能会昏迷数月甚至数年。

Such is the price of his sacrifice for her.  
这便是他为她的牺牲所付出的代价。

Asuka knew what he did entailed. To the young Ikari Shinji, sacrifice is the greatest tribute one can offer someone. To bleed for another, to suffer for another...  
明日香明白他所做的一切意味着什么。对于年轻的碇真嗣来说，牺牲是人们能给予他人的最高敬意。为他人流血，为他人受苦……

That was how one such as he shows affection.  
这便是他这样的人表达情感的方式。

And Asuka stroked the young boy's cheek gently.  
而明日香轻轻抚摸着小男孩的脸颊。

Then he stirred. 随后他动了动。

"A-Asuka?" Shinji's eyes opened slightly to see a mesh of red hair.  
“明、明日香？” 真嗣的眼睛微微睁开，映入眼帘的是一团红色的发丝。

"Sh-Shinji!" Asuka exclaimed. "You're alright!"  
"小-小真嗣！" 明日香惊呼道，"你没事吧！"

"I th-think. I'm a bit sore though..." Shinji's face did not lift from Asuka's chest. Rather he snuggled deeper into it.  
"我-我想是的。只是有点酸痛..." 真嗣的脸并没有从明日香的胸前抬起，反而更深地埋了进去。

Asuka's face turned a deep red hue but held back her embarrassment.  
明日香的脸颊泛起了深红色，但她强忍住了羞涩。

"What's this soft thing... it's so warm... I can sleep here forever..." Shinji mumbled as he nuzzled his head to a more comfortable position.  
"这是什么软软的东西...好温暖...我可以在这里睡上一辈子..." 真嗣喃喃自语，将头埋得更舒服些。

"Heh, it's my treat, runt," Asuka joked. "If you're tired just take a nap," and she gently tightened her hold on the young boy.  
"嘿，这次我请客，小鬼，" 明日香打趣道，"累了就睡会儿吧，" 她温柔地收紧了抱着少年的手臂。

"Thanks..." "谢谢..."

And the young boy drifted off to sleep.  
少年渐渐进入了梦乡。

"No... thank you," Asuka mumbled. She had a new found respect for the boy. Idiot he may be, coward he was not.  
“不...谢谢，”明日香含糊地说。她对这个男孩产生了新的敬意。他或许是个傻瓜，但绝不是懦夫。

Then the entry-plug opened.  
随后，插入栓打开了。

"Asuka!" It was Captain Misato, peering from the opening, who was now head of pilot retrieval operations.  
"明日香！" 是美里队长，从开口处探出头来，现在负责驾驶员回收行动。

"Hey Misato," Asuka smiled, a tinge of regret forming on her lips as she realized Shinji wouldn't be in her arms for much longer.  
"嘿，美里，" 明日香微笑着，一丝遗憾在唇边形成，意识到真嗣很快就不会在她怀里了。

"Well if you're _that_ disappointed to see me I can come back in like an hour," Misato grinned with her arms on her hips.  
"好吧，如果你这么失望见到我，我可以过一小时再来，" 美里咧嘴笑着，双手叉腰。

"_No_!"

But Asuka really wanted to say _Yes! Yes!_  
但明日香真的很想说：是的！是的！
