[Sadistic Shadow](https://fanfiction.net/u/96056/)
Shinji winced. If there were anything physically wrong with the boy that routine checkups did not pick up on, it would be his extreme sensitivity regarding loud noises. An attribute probably brought on by repeated use of his S-DAT player. It made sense that no one had really noticed it, though. After all, the only time it seemed to prove a problem was when _she_ was around. And at the moment, she was certainly _around_. The sudden onslaught of booms, bangs, crashes, and slams were enough to attest to that.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。如果说这个男孩有什么身体上的问题是在常规检查中没有发现的，那一定是他对大声噪音的极度敏感。这一特性很可能是由于频繁使用他的 S-DAT 播放器而导致的。不过，似乎没有人真正注意到这一点。毕竟，只有在她在场的时候，这个问题才会显现出来。而此刻，她确实就在这里。突如其来的轰鸣、撞击、破碎和猛击声足以证明这一点。

He drew in all the breath he could muster, holding it for but a moment before releasing it in a rather distressed sigh. Dropping into a squat, the boy gently deposited several brown bags on the ground and eyed the door to the apartment with no small amount of trepidation. Ringing the doorbell would be so easy, opposed to the cumbersome task of fishing out his keys, but he wasn't quite sure he wanted to suffer the consequences of rousing Asuka from her uh, venting.  
他深吸一口气，屏住片刻后，才带着几分焦虑叹息而出。蹲下身，男孩轻手轻脚地将几个棕色袋子放在地上，目光带着不小的忐忑望向公寓的门。按门铃本应是件轻松的事，远比费劲地掏钥匙来得简单，但他不确定自己是否愿意承受唤醒明日香——呃，她正在发泄情绪——的后果。

However, before he could decide on his course of action, the door swung open at a rather alarming speed and he was met by the devil herself. Her eyes held untold fury and her teeth were clenched in what could only be a painful manner. "Idiot!" She hissed. "How dare you just go off like that, without making dinner?"  
然而，在他做出决定之前，门以惊人的速度猛地打开，他直面了那位怒火中烧的恶魔。她的眼中燃烧着难以言喻的怒火，牙齿紧咬，显然是在忍受痛苦。“白痴！”她低声怒斥，“你怎么敢就这样跑出去，连晚饭都不做？”

He blinked, obviously confused. After all, the reason he had gone out in the first place was because they needed groceries. How could she expect him to make dinner if he had nothing to make it from? Despite how much he wanted to voice such comments, he resigned to simply hanging his head and murmuring a sullen apology.  
他眨了眨眼，显然感到困惑。毕竟，他出门的初衷正是因为他们需要购买食材。如果他手头什么都没有，她又怎能期望他做出晚餐呢？尽管他很想把这些话说出来，但最终还是选择了低头，闷声不响地道歉。

Snorting, the red-haired teen took a step back, leaving just enough room for Shinji to gather the goods and scurry inside. Placing her hands on her hips, she followed the poor boy into the kitchen. Setting the bags on the counter, Shinji tipped one over so he could properly empty it when he stopped short. His brow creased, and a simple frown tugged at his lips. Quickly, he dug through the others, but found everything to be quite alright.  
红发少年嗤笑一声，后退一步，留出足够空间让真嗣收拾货物并匆匆进屋。她双手叉腰，跟着可怜的男孩走进厨房。真嗣将袋子放在柜台上，倾倒其中一个以便彻底清空，却突然停住。他眉头紧锁，简单的皱眉牵动着他的嘴唇。他迅速翻查其他袋子，但发现一切都很正常。

Pen-Pen's food, herbs, spices, and a variety of other condiments, all there. The items he had specially selected for that night's dinner? Gone. Or rather, replaced. It seemed he had picked up the wrong bag at the grocery store. The woman ahead of him, the teacher who had been buying treats for her class…Yes, that must be it. That must be why he had returned home with a bag full of things one would need in order to make…cookies.  
企鹅 PEN-PEN 的食物、香草、香料和其他各种调味品，都在。而他特意为当晚晚餐挑选的物品呢？不见了。或者更确切地说，被替换了。看来他在杂货店拿错了袋子。他前面那位女士，那位为班级购买零食的老师……是的，一定是这样。这就是为什么他带着一袋制作……饼干所需的物品回家。

Asuka made a grab for his ear, but was unsuccessful, for he unknowingly evaded the attack when he sunk to his knees in despair. "Idiot," She repeated her earlier insult, looking quite disgusted. "What's the matter now? Did the _great_ Third Children buy salt instead of pepper?" Sarcasm. What else?  
明日香试图抓住他的耳朵，但没有成功，因为他无意中在绝望中跪下躲避了攻击。"白痴，"她重复了之前的侮辱，看起来相当厌恶。"现在又怎么了？难道伟大的第三适格者买了盐而不是胡椒？"讽刺。还能有什么？

"Something like that," Shinji muttered, trying his best to ignore the peculiar feeling in his fingers, the one making them twitch, as he stood up and began the desperate search for the little business card of their favorite take-out restaurant that Misato always kept around the kitchen.  
"大概是那样吧，" 真嗣低声嘟囔着，尽力忽略手指上那种奇怪的感觉，那种让它们不由自主地抽搐的感觉，他站起身来，开始绝望地寻找那张他们最喜欢的外卖餐厅的小名片，那是美里总是放在厨房里的。

Asuka watched him, expression curious at first, twisting in rage moments later when she realized what he was doing. "You mean to tell me-" Here she shrieked - "That I've been waiting on you all this time when I could have just ordered out?"  
明日香看着他，起初表情好奇，但片刻后意识到他在做什么时，她的表情转为愤怒。"你的意思是告诉我——" 她尖叫起来——"我一直在等你，而我本可以直接叫外卖的？

"I'm sorry," He whispered, before promptly cringing. Even he didn't mean for it to come out that way. "…T-There must have been s-some kind of mix-up at the g-grocery store or s-something…"  
"对不起，" 他低声说道，随即立刻皱起了眉头。连他自己也没想到会这么说出口。"……一定是超市那边出了什么差错……

She seemed to just notice the foodstuffs splayed out over the kitchen counter. "Cookies, Ikari? Hope you remembered the tea. I'd suggest getting out the dolls," The casual way that word rolled right off of the German girl's tongue rather disturbed Shinji, given her track record, "But I'm sure Wondergirl and her little friends have things to do." Again, with the sarcasm.  
她似乎刚刚注意到厨房台面上散落的食物。“饼干，碇？希望你记得买了茶。我建议你把玩偶拿出来，”那个德国女孩随口说出这个词的方式让真嗣感到不安，考虑到她的过往，“但我确信奇迹女孩和她的朋友们还有事情要做。”又是这种讽刺。

Insulted by her cruel jabs at Rei, but even more annoyed by the fact that she simply wouldn't listen, he cupped the sides of his head, hunched over, and in a simply uncharacteristic display, screamed, "**Shut up**!" Wow. Maybe he should go see a doctor, or something. His fingers kept getting itchier by the second.  
被她对绫波的尖刻嘲讽所激怒，但更让他恼火的是她根本就不听，他双手捂住头，弯下腰，以一种完全不符合他性格的方式尖叫道：“闭嘴！”哇。也许他应该去看医生，或者什么的。他的手指越来越痒了。

Stunned into silence, for once, Asuka took a step back. "Jeez," She muttered, averting her gaze, trying to blow the whole thing off. "It's not _my_ fault _you_ were too _stupid_ to check and see if you had the right groceries before you left the store."  
震惊得一时无言，这是第一次，明日香后退了一步。“天哪，”她嘟囔着，移开视线，试图把整件事抛诸脑后。“你太蠢了，没在离开商店前检查一下是否买对了东西，这可不是我的错。”

He should have known better than to try and get any sort of compassion out of her. He figured he wouldn't be able to do that, even if he could stick some sort of hook in her and _drag_ it out. Sighing, he recomposed himself and set to work clearing the counter off. Let Asuka order what she wanted. He was just going to take a bath and go to bed.  
他早该明白，从她那里寻求同情是徒劳的。他知道，即便能用某种钩子勾住她，也难以拖出半分怜悯。叹了口气，他重新整理情绪，开始清理台面。让明日香想点什么就点什么吧。他只想洗个澡，然后去睡觉。

"W-Wait!" “等、等一下！”

He briefly turned to face her.  
他短暂地转过身来面对她。

"I…Uh…I," Noticing she was stuttering, she scowled. "The _least_ you could do is make some of those stupid cookies. After all, you left me here with nothing to eat for all this time!"  
"我…呃…我，" 注意到自己结巴了，她皱起了眉头。"你至少可以做些那些愚蠢的饼干。毕竟，你留我一个人在这里，这么长时间什么吃的都没有！"

He simply stared at her for the longest time. Asuka returned the stare, though hers was quite defiant (how dare he look at her like that?). Just when she was getting irritated - and getting ready to tear him a new one - he dropped his gaze and nodded. "Sure thing," He mumbled, shuffling off to fetch his apron and slippers, leaving a smirking Second in his wake.  
他只是长时间地盯着她。明日香回瞪过去，眼神中满是挑衅（他怎么敢那样看她？）。就在她开始感到烦躁——准备好好教训他一顿时——他垂下目光，点了点头。"没问题，"他嘟囔着，拖着脚步去拿围裙和拖鞋，留下一个得意的第二名在他身后窃笑。

"Can you believe it?" Asuka growled, slamming her fist on the table, prompting a…Sympathetic look from Shinji? Ordinarily, the girl wouldn't tolerate any sort of pity, but she needed this. "So I say to her…"  
"你能相信吗？" 明日香咆哮着，拳头重重地砸在桌子上，引来了真嗣一个…同情的眼神？通常，这女孩不会容忍任何形式的怜悯，但她现在需要这个。"所以我跟她说…"

Said boy listened intently to what the red-head had to say. Sure, she was complaining as always, but it was somehow different, listening to her complain about someone else for a change. He had never noticed quite how nice her voice sounded. Probably because she was always either screeching like a fish-wife or pouring on false charm.  
那个男孩专注地听着红发女孩的话。当然，她一如既往地在抱怨，但这次听她抱怨别人，感觉有些不同。他从未注意到她的声音听起来有多悦耳。可能是因为她总是要么像泼妇一样尖叫，要么就是虚情假意地讨好。

From his vantage point, he was able to make sure the cookies weren't burning. Noticing that they were just about done, Shinji stood up to fetch the hot pads. Asuka didn't even seem realize he had moved. The boy couldn't hide his frown. Maybe this wasn't so nice after all. Seemed she was just using him, as usual. Oh well. Again, it was nicer than getting his head ripped off.  
从他的位置，他能确保饼干没有烤焦。注意到它们差不多好了，真嗣站起来去拿隔热垫。明日香似乎都没意识到他已经动了。男孩无法掩饰他的皱眉。也许这并不那么美好。看来她又在利用他，一如既往。唉，这总比被她撕破脸皮要好。

Drawing back from the oven after safely retrieving the baked goods, he closed the heavy door with his foot and set them on the range to cool. Removing the pads from his hands, he groped around in one of the cabinets for two tall glasses. Filling them with chilled milk, he set them back in the refrigerator and grabbed a clean plate from the sink.  
安全取出烘焙好的食物后，他用脚关上沉重的烤箱门，将它们放在炉子上冷却。从手上取下隔热垫，他在其中一个橱柜里摸索着找出了两个高脚杯。倒满冰镇牛奶后，他将杯子放回冰箱，又从水槽里拿了一个干净的盘子。

The cookies seemed fit for consumption around the time when Asuka's rant-slash-story appeared to be drawing to a close. Using a spatula to deposit the cookies onto the plate he had prepared, he was unaware of two ice-blue orbs watching his every moment, with something resembling…fascination. Swinging by the fridge to retrieve the glasses of milk, he brought both them and the plate of gooey, chocolate chip cookies to the table.  
当明日香的长篇大论似乎接近尾声时，那些曲奇看起来正好适合食用。他用刮刀将曲奇盛放到事先准备好的盘子上，却未察觉到两颗冰蓝色的眼睛正注视着他的一举一动，带着一种近乎……着迷的神情。他走到冰箱旁取出牛奶杯，将牛奶和那盘热乎乎、夹着巧克力碎的曲奇一同端到了桌前。

The two munched away in silence, pausing every once in awhile to take a sip - or a gulp, depending on which pilot you were referring to - of the refreshing liquid.  
两人默默地吃着，不时停下来啜饮一口——或者大口喝下，取决于你指的是哪位驾驶员——那清凉的液体。

Too absorbed in his thoughts to notice anything else, Shinji reached for the last cookie and nearly died when he felt himself clasp something warm in his firm yet gentle grip. It certainly wasn't that elusive cookie. He let loose a startled squeak and started to shrink back. "S-Sorry!"  
过于沉浸在自己的思绪中，以至于没注意到其他任何事情的碇真嗣伸手去拿最后一块曲奇，却在紧握中感觉到一股温暖。那绝不是那块难以捉摸的曲奇。他惊叫一声，开始缩回手。“对-对不起！”

"Don't be." It was now she who held his hand in her grasp.  
"别这样。" 现在，是她握住了他的手。

His eyes trailed up her arm to light on her face, but she was concentrating on the connection of their hands. Using her free hand, she picked up the cookie and bent it sideways on the plate, causing it to snap directly in half. Flipping his appendage over, she pried his fingers apart and placed one half of the cookie in his open palm.  
他的目光顺着她的手臂上移，落在她的脸上，而她正专注于他们手部的接触。她用空闲的手拿起饼干，在盘子上将其弯折，使其直接断成两半。她翻过他的手，掰开他的手指，将半块饼干放入他张开的手掌中。

Swiftly retracting, she glanced down at the other half of the cookie that she still held. Bringing it up to her lips, she took a fierce bite of it before draining the last of the milk in her glass. Carefully slamming the cup down on the table, she pushed back her chair and abruptly stood.  
她迅速收回手，低头看向手中剩下的半块饼干。她将其举至唇边，狠狠地咬了一口，随后喝完了杯中剩余的牛奶。她小心地将杯子重重地放在桌上，推开椅子，猛地站了起来。

Stalking across the softly padded apartment in the general direction of her room, she tossed her silky mane, carelessly calling over her shoulder, "They were lumpy." Surprisingly enough, her tone held no malice. She seemed to be employing the use of her ever-resourceful sarcasm again. But like everything else about her since they had first sat down at the table, there was something different about it. Something softer. Something nicer. Something almost _friendly_.  
她踏着柔软的地毯，朝着房间的方向走去，随手甩了甩她那丝滑的长发，漫不经心地回头喊道：“那些东西疙疙瘩瘩的。”出乎意料的是，她的语气中并无恶意。她似乎又在运用她那永远机智的讽刺。但自从他们第一次坐到餐桌旁以来，她的一切都有些不同了。更柔和，更亲切，甚至有些友好。

For the first time in a long, long while, Ikari Shinji smiled. And it was every bit as genuine as the one a certain red-head unknowingly mirrored, all the way across the apartment.  
许久未曾有过，碇真嗣露出了微笑。这微笑与公寓另一头某个红发少女无意中模仿的笑容一样真挚。

**A/N:** Holy crap, I actually did it. My first one-shot in the fanfiction department. I honestly didn't think I could pull it off, folks. I generally tend to drag stuff out forever. Another big accomplishment? It's G-Rated! LMFAO. Honestly, it is. I swear it.  
作者注：天哪，我真的做到了。这是我第一篇同人短篇。说实话，我没想到我能完成，各位。我通常会把事情拖得很长。另一个大成就？这是 G 级！哈哈哈。真的，我发誓。

On another note, I know there are so many places I could take this story, but it's staying a one-shot. Want more? Check out my other story, I.O.U. One Galaxy. This fic was inspired by a scene mentioned in said fic. I used hot chocolate in that one, and milk here. And also, Asuka called the cookies 'lumpy', rather than tough. So sue me. "Lumpy Cookies (Or So She Said)" sounds retarded. Besides, I mentioned in the fic that the cookies were nice and gooey ...  
换个话题，我知道这个故事有很多发展方向，但它将保持为一发完结。想要更多？看看我的另一篇作品《我欠你一个银河》。这篇同人灵感来源于那篇作品中提到的一个场景。在那里我用的是热巧克力，而这里用的是牛奶。还有，明日香把饼干称为‘疙瘩’，而不是硬邦邦的。所以告我吧。‘疙瘩饼干（据她所说）’听起来很傻。此外，我在文中提到过，那些饼干其实又软又黏...

So leave me your honest comments and criticism. I myself am only fond of the opening paragraph and the ending ones. The middle was too _blah_ for me. Probably because I wrote it. Probably because I found it so hard to write. Anyway…  
所以请留下你的真实评论和批评。我自己只喜欢开头和结尾的段落。中间部分对我来说太乏味了。可能是因为我写的。可能是因为我发现它太难写了。无论如何…
