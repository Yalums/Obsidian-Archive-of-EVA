Also, this is meant to be taken humorously (and someone insane) and in no way seriously. For some reason this idea popped into my head one day and just wouldn't stop nagging me. This is the result, though I'm not quite sure of what to make of the ending of this since this story seemed to take on a life of its own as I wrote it.

**Addiction 上瘾**

He had no idea he had been standing there stiff as a board while his first kiss—_his first kiss!—_was in progress. All he knew were his nose was uncomfortable pinched shut, his lungs were screaming for oxygen, he was pretty sure he was turning blue, and he could barely even _feel_ Asuka's lips on his since his whole body was numb; must be a side effect of being oxygen deprived. Finally after who knew how long, since he long ago lost track of time, Shinji pulled away because his lungs' demands for oxygen was so great. He greedily gulped down a few lungfuls of air, never once paying attention to his roommate's strange spaced off expression until she suddenly bolted down the hall and into the bathroom.  
他完全没有意识到自己像块木头一样僵硬地站在那里，正在进行他的初吻——他的初吻！——他只知道自己的鼻子被紧紧捏住，肺部急需氧气，他几乎肯定自己正在变蓝，而且由于全身麻木，他几乎感觉不到明日香的嘴唇；这一定是缺氧的副作用。终于，不知过了多久，因为他早已忘记了时间，真嗣因为肺部对氧气的迫切需求而退开。他贪婪地大口呼吸了几下，从未注意到室友那奇怪的恍惚表情，直到她突然冲向走廊，跑进了浴室。

Shinji felt confused and hurt because if his hunch was anything to go by, then those gargles coming from the bathroom definitely confirmed his suspicions. He was a lousy kisser and he had just ruined his and probably, but he wasn't so sure, Asuka's first kiss as well. He felt disappoint course through his body and was about to retreat to his room when Misato and Kaji suddenly made their entry into the apartment. Misato was asleep and Shinji could smell a faint smell of alcohol on his guardian. She probably passed out after having a few drinks.  
真嗣感到困惑和受伤，因为如果他的直觉没错的话，那么从浴室传来的咕噜声无疑证实了他的猜疑。他是个糟糕的接吻者，而且他刚刚可能毁掉了自己和阿斯卡的初吻——虽然他不太确定是不是阿斯卡。他感到失望在体内蔓延，正准备退回自己的房间时，美里和加持突然进入了公寓。美里已经睡着了，真嗣能闻到她身上淡淡的酒味。她大概是喝了几杯后醉倒了。

He sighed to himself at the sight of his guardian and bid Kaji goodnight on the older man's way out. It was strange that Asuka never made an entrance when her precious Kaji-san decided to grace her with his presence. Was Shinji that horrible a kisser that it distracted Asuka that much? Shinji cringed at the thought and retreated to his room to listen to his trusty SDAT player.  
看到监护人的样子，他暗自叹了口气，并在加持离开时向对方道了晚安。奇怪的是，每当她珍爱的加持先生决定来访时，明日香从未出现过。难道他的吻技真的那么糟糕，以至于让明日香如此分心吗？想到这里，真嗣皱了皱眉，退回自己的房间，听起了他信赖的 SDAT 播放器。

Memories of the kiss repeated through Shinji's mind and each time he remembered the look on her face Shinji cringed some more. He had his head buried under the pillow and by the time at least an hour had passed, Shinji decided that he needed to sleep. That was if his mind would allow him any peace at all…  
那个吻的记忆在真嗣的脑海中反复回放，每次想起她脸上的表情，真嗣就更加畏缩。他把头埋在枕头下，至少过了一个小时，真嗣决定他需要睡觉。如果他的思绪能让他得到哪怕一丝安宁的话……

Sighing to himself, Shinji entered the bathroom and thoroughly brushed his teeth. He had no idea who drilled into him the habits of good dental hygiene, but he wasn't one to complain if it meant less visits to the dentist. After replacing his toothbrush in the toothbrush holder, Shinji opened the bathroom door to leave but had to stop immediately in his tracks at the sight of his roommate on the other side.  
真嗣叹了口气，走进浴室，彻底地刷了牙。他不知道是谁灌输给他良好的口腔卫生习惯，但如果这意味着减少看牙医的次数，他也不抱怨。把牙刷放回牙刷架后，真嗣打开浴室门准备离开，却在看到门外室友的那一刻停住了脚步。

Asuka was looking at him weirdly with an expression he couldn't identify and Shinji didn't like it one bit. He could practically feel the sweat running down his face in a matter of a few seconds. Was she going to yell at him for something he didn't do? Or was she going to yell at him for being such a horrible kisser? Shinji gulped and instinctively took a step back. She took a step forward, causing him to reflexively back up while she took another step forward until he felt his back press up against the bathroom wall.  
明日香正用一种他无法辨认的表情奇怪地看着他，这让真嗣非常不喜欢。他几乎能感觉到汗水在几秒钟内顺着脸颊流下。她会因为他没做过的事而对他大吼大叫吗？还是因为她觉得他接吻技术太糟糕？真嗣咽了口唾沫，本能地后退了一步。她向前迈了一步，这让他反射性地又退了一步，而她继续向前，直到他的背紧贴着浴室的墙壁。

Uh oh… He was cornered and he had nowhere to go.  
哎呀…他被困住了，无处可逃。

Shinji could only pray that Asuka's temper wasn't too bad at that current moment because he was still young! He had yet to see the world! He wanted to experience life outside of piloting EVA! How was he supposed to do that if he was dead? Shinji gulped again and closed his eyes to prepare for the onslaught of verbal and hopefully not, physical abuse. He could feel her hands grab the sides of his face. They were warm, but that was beside the point. He had a bad feeling in his gut and he didn't even want to think of what she'd do by holding his head still… slap him maybe? But if she were to slap him she didn't really need to hold his head still. So why…?  
真嗣只能祈祷那一刻明日香脾气不要太坏，因为他还年轻！他还没见识过这个世界！他还想体验驾驶 EVA 之外的生活！如果他死了，这一切怎么可能实现呢？真嗣再次咽了口唾沫，闭上眼睛准备迎接即将到来的言语攻击，希望不是身体上的。他能感觉到她的手抓住了他的脸颊两侧。它们很温暖，但这不是重点。他心里有种不祥的预感，他甚至不想去想她固定住他的头会做什么……扇他耳光吗？但如果她要扇他耳光，其实并不需要固定住他的头。那么为什么……？

Suddenly a pair of soft lips was pressed against his. His eyes flew open in shock but his whole body turned rigid and refused to move even a muscle. _Kami_… what was happening?  
突然，一对柔软的嘴唇贴上了他的。他的眼睛惊愕地睁大，但整个身体变得僵硬，连一根肌肉都动弹不得。天啊……发生了什么？

After a while, she pulled away with that same spaced out look on her face, but this time she let out a little hum under her breath. It sounded approving? The kiss was shorter than the previous one. He knew because his lungs were grateful to be spared of abuse, but even then, his body was literally frozen in shock. Was he just kissed by Sohryu Asuka Langley? For the second time in a day? And willingly at that? He felt as if he was about to faint.  
过了一会儿，她带着同样恍惚的神情抽离，但这次她低声发出了一声轻哼。听起来像是在赞许？这个吻比之前的短。他知道，因为他的肺部感激没有受到折磨，但即便如此，他的身体还是震惊得僵住了。他刚刚是被惣流·明日香·兰格雷亲了吗？一天之内第二次？而且还是自愿的？他感觉自己快要晕过去了。

While his body rebelled and refused to move, Asuka casually moved over to the sink and brushed her teeth as if she hadn't done something out of the ordinary like kissing her roommate whom she bullied every day. When she was finished she merely cast him an amused look and walked out of the bathroom, leaving Shinji by himself, pressed up against the wall, wide-eyed, and gaping like a fish.  
尽管他的身体抗拒着不愿动弹，明日香却若无其事地走到水槽边刷牙，仿佛她没有做出什么出格的事，比如亲吻她每天欺负的室友。刷完牙后，她只是投给他一个好笑的眼神，便走出了浴室，留下真嗣一个人靠在墙上，瞪大眼睛，张着嘴像条鱼一样。

Oh boy… somebody tell him he was dreaming…  
哦，天哪……有人告诉他这是在做梦吗……

---

Shinji could barely sleep that night since his mind was on overdrive. It kept repeating images from the first crazy-oxygen-depriving-kiss to the scary-ambush-kiss for hours on end. He had no idea when he finally managed to fall asleep, but he bet that it was really late if his body screaming at him in exhaustion was anything to go by. Even after he woke up for the day, Shinji couldn't convince himself that yesterday was real. After all, what were the chances of Asuka kissing a wimp like him _twice_ in one night? The first time still felt surreal. So, therefore it naturally must've all been a dream his deluded mind had concocted just to drive him insane. Yes, that was it.  
那一夜，真嗣几乎无法入睡，因为他的思绪在高速运转。从那个疯狂到令人窒息的初吻，到惊险的突袭之吻，这些画面在他脑海中不断重播，持续了数小时。他不知道自己最终是什么时候睡着的，但根据身体疲惫至极的抗议声，他敢打赌那一定很晚了。即便到了第二天醒来，真嗣也无法说服自己昨天的一切是真实的。毕竟，像他这样的懦夫，明日香怎么可能在一夜之间吻他两次呢？第一次的感觉依然如梦似幻。所以，这一切自然肯定只是他那妄想的大脑为了逼疯他而编造的梦境。没错，就是这样。

Shinji busied himself with preparing the Asuka's and his bentos for the day. Misato still seemed to be sleeping off the effects of last night so Shinji didn't bother waking her up. After capping the bento boxes and wrapping them in handkerchiefs to keep them tied up tightly, Shinji went about cooking breakfast.  
真嗣忙着为明日香和自己准备当天的便当。美里似乎还在睡梦中，尚未从昨晚的宿醉中恢复，所以真嗣没有打扰她。他将便当盒盖好，用方巾包裹并紧紧系好，然后开始准备早餐。

Asuka entered shortly after looking the same as usual. She didn't seem to let on that anything special had happened last night so Shinji could only assume that his mind was playing tricks on him. Again. His mind was so evil.  
明日香不久后走了进来，看起来和往常一样。她似乎没有透露出昨晚发生了什么特别的事情，所以真嗣只能认为自己的脑子又在作怪了。又一次。他的脑子真是太坏了。

Breakfast was a quiet and quick affair as the two teenagers gulped down what they could before they had to depart.  
早餐在两个青少年的快速吞咽中安静而迅速地进行，他们匆匆吃完，以便及时出发。

Shinji was behind Asuka on their way out and he was in the middle of putting on his shoes when she sudden spun around on her heels to face him. He was caught off guard and almost fell backward. Luckily months of training for EVA had helped hone some of his reflexes so the amount of his embarrassing moments had declined, though not by much, Shinji noted wryly.  
真嗣跟在明日香后面出门，正在穿鞋时，她突然转过身来面对他。他措手不及，差点向后摔倒。幸运的是，几个月的 EVA 训练提高了他的反应能力，让他尴尬的时刻有所减少，尽管并不多，真嗣自嘲地想。

Asuka had this intense look in her eyes and it unnerved Shinji; it couldn't be anything good. They hadn't said much to each other that morning besides a casual exchange of Good Mornings. He was about to ask what was wrong when suddenly she lunged forward, scaring Shinji to no end, and pressed her lips solidly against his.  
明日香眼中闪烁着强烈的光芒，这让真嗣感到不安；这肯定不是什么好事。那天早上他们没怎么说话，除了随意地互道早安。他正要问她怎么了，突然她猛地扑了过来，吓得真嗣魂飞魄散，紧紧地吻上了他的唇。

W-what just happened? _Again_? If his eyes weren't bulging wide enough last night, they sure were now! Especially after he had convinced himself that last night was nothing but a dream.  
刚、刚刚发生了什么？又来了？如果昨晚他的眼睛还没瞪得够大，那现在绝对是了！尤其是在他刚刚说服自己昨晚只是一场梦之后。

She pulled back and ran her tongue over her lips with a smirk.  
她退后一步，舔了舔嘴唇，露出一丝得意的笑。

Shinji looked on in both confusion and horror.  
真嗣困惑又惊恐地看着。

Sending one last amused glance over her shoulder, she left through the open door, leaving her stunned roommate standing at the doorway with wide eyes, a gaping mouth, and shoes that were halfway put on. Why did this feel familiar? He shuddered.  
她最后一次回眸一笑，便从敞开的门离开了，留下她那目瞪口呆的室友站在门口，眼睛瞪得大大的，嘴巴张得大大的，鞋子只穿了一半。为什么这种感觉似曾相识？他打了个寒颤。

"Boy, you better close your mouth. You'll attract flies with how long you had it hanging open," said an elderly woman, Shinji recognized as a neighbor two doors down, as she walked past him. "You'd think he'd never been kissed before," she said under her breath as she continued down the hall.  
“孩子，你最好把嘴闭上。你嘴巴张这么久，会招来苍蝇的，”一位老妇人说道，真嗣认出她是住在两户之外的邻居，她从他身边走过。“你会以为他以前从没被亲过呢，”她低声自语，继续沿着走廊走去。

He snapped his jaw shut, his cheeks red.  
他猛地闭上嘴，双颊泛红。

---

Shinji was almost late to school and luckily managed to squeeze in right before the teacher. He scurried to his desk, ignoring the bemused look on Asuka's face and the curious ones on his friends' faces. After going through the morning routine Shinji finally slumped onto his desk in relief for another boring day, except the day started off as anything but boring. He wanted to tell his friends of the kiss from that morning but he had a feeling that they'd either laugh at him until their sides split open or wouldn't believe him and call him out for lying. Shinji groaned. Sometimes it sucked having friends that didn't believe him.  
真嗣差点迟到，幸好在老师进来前勉强挤进了教室。他匆匆走向自己的座位，无视了明日香戏谑的表情和朋友们好奇的眼神。经历了早上的例行公事后，真嗣终于松懈地瘫坐在桌前，准备迎接又一个无聊的日子，然而这一天却出乎意料地不无聊。他想告诉朋友们今早的那个吻，但又觉得他们要么会笑到肚子疼，要么会不相信他，认为他在撒谎。真嗣叹了口气。有时候，拥有不相信自己的朋友真是糟糕透顶。

Luckily the day passed by relatively normal and nothing out of the ordinary happened. It led Shinji to believe that Asuka was just playing some prank on him, which for the record was not funny at all.  
幸运的是，这一天相对平静，没有什么异常发生。这让真嗣觉得明日香可能只是在捉弄他，尽管这并不好笑。

"So why were you late this morning?" asked Kensuke. He and Touji had moved over to sit by Shinji to eat lunch together.  
“那今天早上你为什么迟到了？” 真嗣问道。他和东治已经挪过来坐在真嗣旁边一起吃午饭。

Shinji groaned and unwrapped his bento. "You wouldn't believe me even if I told you."  
真嗣叹了口气，打开了自己的便当。“就算我说了你们也不会相信的。”

That only functioned to pique his two friends' interest even more. "Try us," said Touji. Kensuke nodded in agreement.  
这反而更加激起了他两位朋友的兴趣。“试试看嘛，”东治说。真嗣点头表示同意。

Shinji opened his mouth to relay the events from this morning but then suddenly closed his mouth as he realized just how ridiculous it sounded after replaying the scenario in his head for the hundredth time.  
真嗣张开嘴想要叙述今早的事件，但随即又突然闭上了嘴，因为他意识到在脑海中第无数次重演那个场景后，这听起来是多么荒谬。

His two friends noticed the delay and leaned forward eagerly to pump Shinji for information. Feeling uncomfortable from having his personal space violated, Shinji leaned way back on his chair.  
他的两个朋友注意到了这个延迟，急切地向前倾身，试图从真嗣那里套出信息。感到个人空间被侵犯的不适，真嗣将椅子向后仰得远远的。

"It sounds crazy and I'm still having trouble believing it happened. It's probably my mind playing tricks on me. It's not a big deal," said Shinji, trying to blow off the question.  
“这听起来很疯狂，我仍然难以相信它真的发生了。可能只是我的大脑在捉弄我。没什么大不了的，”真嗣试图搪塞这个问题。

Neither Kensuke nor Touji looked amused. If anything, they looked like they were going to try harder to pump him for information. "Nice try, but yer not gettin' off dat easy," said Touji.  
无论是真嗣还是冬二，看起来都不觉得有趣。如果说有什么的话，他们似乎更想从他那里套出更多信息。“不错的尝试，但你可别想这么轻易脱身，”冬二说道。

Shinji groaned and let his eyes wander around in the classroom—anything to avoid his friends' faces. Ayanami had not gone to school today so her desk was empty. His other remaining classmates were goofing off in the in several corners of the room. Eventually his gaze landed on Asuka as she laughed at something Hikari had said. She looked happy and amused about something, but Shinji didn't know what.  
真嗣叹了口气，让目光在教室里游移——任何能避开朋友们脸庞的事物都行。绫波今天没来学校，所以她的座位空着。他剩下的同学们在教室的几个角落里嬉闹。最终，他的目光落在了明日香身上，她正因光说的话而大笑。她看起来很开心，对某件事感到有趣，但真嗣不知道是什么。

His friends followed Shinji's line of sight and snickered.  
他的朋友们顺着真嗣的视线看去，窃笑起来。

"So you were admirin' da devil all mornin', huh? No wonder you were late. She's easy on da eyes but man her personality is hell," said Touji.  
“所以你整个早上都在欣赏那恶魔，嗯？难怪迟到了。她长得确实好看，但性格可真是地狱级的。” 冬二说道。

Kensuke sighed disappointingly at Shinji. "Shinji, Shinji, Shinji. You are so indiscrete. Now I know why you're always getting beaten to a bloody pulp."  
剑介失望地叹了口气，对真嗣说：“真嗣啊真嗣，你真是太不谨慎了。现在我明白你为什么总是被打得鼻青脸肿了。”

Shinji shot a wry look at his friends. "Gee, thanks."  
真嗣苦笑着看向朋友们。“哎，谢谢了。”

Kensuke grinned. "You're welcome!"  
健介咧嘴一笑。“不客气！”

---

The rest of the day passed by relatively fast. Since neither Shinji nor Asuka had cleanup duty they left immediately after classes were done for the day. Another bonus was that today was a rare day where they didn't have any NERV business to handle, so they were free to spend it as they pleased. Originally Shinji planned to spend the rest of the afternoon with his friends but Touji had to back out because of his basketball practice and before Shinji could even make plans with Kensuke, Asuka had literally dragged Shinji away by the wrist. Kensuke was snickering at the role reversals as Shinji was pulled farther and farther away off the school grounds.  
那天剩下的时间过得相对较快。由于真嗣和明日香都没有清洁任务，他们一放学就立刻离开了。另一个好处是，今天是个难得的日子，他们没有任何 NERV 的事务要处理，所以可以自由地度过这一天。原本真嗣计划下午和朋友们一起度过，但东治因为篮球训练不得不退出，而真嗣还没来得及和健介制定计划，明日香就 literally 拽着真嗣的手腕把他拉走了。健介看着角色颠倒的情景，窃笑着，真嗣被越拉越远，离开了学校。

"Hey! What gives!" said Shinji once he had the chance to.  
“嘿！怎么回事！”真嗣一有机会就问道。

Asuka rolled her eyes at his demand, but didn't answer. Instead, she tightened her grip around his wrist and pulled him more forcefully in the direction that Shinji realized was opposite of home.  
明日香对他的要求翻了个白眼，但没有回答。相反，她更紧地抓住他的手腕，更用力地拉着他，真嗣意识到这是朝着家的反方向走。

He furrowed his brows in confusion and was about to make a comment on where he was being dragged to when they suddenly stopped in front of a store. It was a new ice cream parlor that opened up last week so there were banners, posters, and specials posted everywhere. It also didn't help that the long was fairly long and growing.  
他皱起眉头，感到困惑，正要开口询问自己被拖向何处时，他们突然停在了一家店前。这是一家新开的冰淇淋店，上周才开业，所以到处都是横幅、海报和特价广告。而且，队伍已经排得很长，并且还在不断增长。

"What are we doing here?"  
“我们来这儿干嘛？”

Asuka rolled her eyes at him again. "Isn't it obvious?" She gestured at the new establishment and said, "To try it out of course! Hikari was telling me about it at lunch."  
明日香再次对他翻了个白眼。“这不是很明显吗？”她指着新开的店铺说，“当然是去试试看啦！光在午饭时跟我提起过。”

Shinji only looked at her blankly. He didn't see what any of this had to do with him. If Asuka wanted to try the new ice cream parlor so badly she could've just asked Hikari to accompany her.  
真嗣只是茫然地看着她。他不明白这一切跟他有什么关系。如果明日香这么想尝试新开的冰淇淋店，她完全可以直接叫光陪她去。

At his blank look, she huffed in annoyance and pulled him inside to where the AC was running and the long line was forming.  
见他一脸茫然，她不悦地哼了一声，拉着他走进店里，那里空调开着，长队已经开始排起来了。

Shinji knew that he was brought here for a reason when he ended up footing the bill. Sighing, he quietly licked at his ice cream cone on the walk home. He noticed out of the corner of his eye that Asuka was nearly done with hers and he had just barely begun!  
当真嗣发现自己最终付了账时，他知道被带到这里是有原因的。叹了口气，他静静地舔着冰淇淋走在回家的路上。他眼角瞥见明日香几乎已经吃完了她的冰淇淋，而他才刚刚开始！

The walk home was filled with Asuka's blabbering about random things she found interesting. Shinji tried to appear interested, but being a boy, he naturally tuned out anything that didn't catch his interest. Shinji just finished his ice cream and they were waiting by the elevators of the apartment complex when Asuka suddenly reached out to grab his upper arm.  
回家的路上充满了明日香关于她觉得有趣的各种事情的喋喋不休。真嗣试图表现出感兴趣的样子，但作为一个男孩，他自然地忽略了那些没有引起他兴趣的事情。真嗣刚吃完他的冰淇淋，他们站在公寓楼的电梯前，明日香突然伸手抓住了他的上臂。

Fear filled his body and he couldn't help but reflexively take a step back, but was held in place by Asuka's strong grip. The look in her eyes was vaguely familiar and the last time she had whirled at him was this morning. And that had led to…  
恐惧充满了他的身体，他不由自主地后退了一步，但被明日香有力的手抓住了。她眼中的神情有些熟悉，上次她突然转向他是在今天早上。而那次导致了……

Her lips covered his in a matter of seconds. He let out a meek 'eep!' but that went unheard as Asuka pulled back after a moment with a smirk on her lips and a hint of chocolate ice cream along the corner of her mouth.  
她的唇在几秒钟内覆盖了他的。他发出一声微弱的'哎呀！'，但这一声被忽略了，因为明日香片刻后带着一丝得意的微笑退开，嘴角还残留着一点巧克力冰淇淋的痕迹。

Shinji stared at her wide eyed. Didn't she have raspberry? He then realized that his lips felt strangely wet all around and that he couldn't taste the ice cream he had eaten anymore. His eyes widened even more. Did she just…?  
真嗣瞪大了眼睛看着她。她不是有覆盆子味的吗？随后他意识到自己的嘴唇周围感觉异常湿润，而且再也尝不到之前吃的冰淇淋的味道了。他的眼睛瞪得更大了。她刚刚是……？

Asuka was gone in the newly arrived elevator car while Shinji continued to stare.  
随着新到的电梯车，明日香已经离开了，而真嗣依旧呆呆地站在那里。

"Is this going to be your normal facial expression from now on?" said someone to Shinji's right.  
“从今往后这就是你的常态表情了吗？”坐在真嗣右边的人说道。

He jumped up in alarm as he realized that the elderly woman from this morning was staring at him in amusement. He was caught gaping like a moron twice in one day by the same person no less.  
他惊跳起来，意识到今早那位老妇人正饶有兴致地盯着他看。他居然在同一天内两次被同一个人看到像傻瓜一样张着嘴。

Oh Kami… open up the earth and swallow him up whole… He was sure his face was so red it could rival Unit-02.  
哦，天啊……让大地裂开把他整个吞下去吧……他确信自己的脸红得足以媲美二号机。

It was the most awkward elevator ride up ever.  
这是有史以来最尴尬的一次电梯之旅。

---

When he entered the apartment Shinji tried to muster up the courage to ask Asuka what the events of today and last night were all about since he was rather convinced that he wasn't hallucinating after the _fourth_ kiss he'd ever received in his life was from the same person… and all in a span of twenty-four hours.  
当他进入公寓时，真嗣试图鼓起勇气问明日香今天和昨晚到底发生了什么，因为他相当确信自己没有产生幻觉——他一生中收到的第四个吻来自同一个人，而且这一切都发生在二十四小时之内。

Asuka was in the living room in her home attire after changing out of her school uniform. She was flipping through the channels with Pen-Pen seated next to her and munching on a bag of chips she found.  
明日香换下校服，穿着家居服坐在客厅里，一边翻看频道，一边和坐在她旁边的 Pen-Pen 一起吃着她找到的一袋薯片。

All Shinji could do was stare. The scene and the atmosphere were just so _normal_!  
新治能做的只有盯着看。这场景和氛围简直太正常了！

Okay! Be brave, Shinji! You can ask her! You can do it! She won't eat you alive! That's what Angels are for!  
好吧！勇敢点，新治！你可以问她的！你能做到！她不会把你生吞活剥的！那是使徒的活儿！

He grimaced. Needless to say, his subconscious had a sick sense of humor for encouragement.  
他皱了皱眉。不用说，他的潜意识在鼓励时有着一种病态的幽默感。

Shinji took a deep breath and opened his mouth in preparation to ask what the kisses were all about when suddenly a messy-haired, bleary-eyed Misato stumbled into the room and bumped into almost every piece of furniture they owned between the walk to the living room and the kitchen.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，正准备开口询问那些吻是怎么回事，突然间，一头乱发、睡眼惺忪的美里跌跌撞撞地闯进了房间，从门口走到客厅再到厨房的这段路上，几乎撞上了他们家的每一件家具。

"Mornin', Shin-chan." And she had her head stuck in the fridge to rummage for beer.  
“早啊，真嗣君。”她把头伸进冰箱里翻找啤酒。

Shinji closed his mouth. There was no way he could ask something like _that_ in the presence of his guardian, not when she was the type of person to tease mercilessly and for days on end. If only Misato had better timing…  
真嗣闭上了嘴。在他监护人在场的情况下，他绝不可能问出那样的问题，尤其是当她是个会无情取笑并持续好几天的人。要是美里能有个更好的时机就好了……

"Something wrong?" asked Misato, her trusty beer in hand.  
“有什么不对劲吗？”美里问道，手里还拿着她那瓶可靠的啤酒。

Shinji sighed and shook his head, deflated.  
真嗣叹了口气，摇摇头，显得有些沮丧。

Asuka smirked at him from across the room.  
明日香在房间的另一头对他得意地笑了笑。

---

Shinji groaned to himself as he finished cooking the fishes in the frying pan and lifted them up to serve onto individual serving plates.  
真嗣一边在煎锅里烹调着鱼，一边自言自语地抱怨着，随后将煎好的鱼盛到各自的餐盘上。

Misato had the day off and she didn't go to work the entire day. It was both nice and frustrating at the same time. It was nice because Asuka didn't treat him any differently than usual and there were no more surprise kisses. It was frustrating because he still wanted to know what that was all about! And he couldn't very well ask that in front of Misato…  
美里今天休假，一整天都没去上班。这种感觉既好又恼人。好的是明日香对待他的态度和往常一样，没有再出现意外的亲吻。恼人的是他仍然想知道那究竟是怎么回事！而且他也不能当着美里的面问这件事……

Thankfully the evening came and went without anything amiss. Shinji was just returning to his room after brushing his teeth when he felt a hand rest upon his shoulder. It was small and warm, much smaller than Misato's. Misato was in the living room and it wasn't a flipper, not that it could reach as high as his shoulder anyway. That only left...  
幸运的是，这个晚上平静地过去了，没有任何异常。真嗣刷完牙，正要回房间时，感觉到一只手搭在了他的肩膀上。那只手小巧而温暖，比美里的手小得多。美里在客厅，而且那也不是鳍，再说鳍也够不到他的肩膀。这样一来，只剩下……

Asuka smirked back at him and before he could open his mouth or do anything at all, she had leaned forward and pecked his lips. "Good night, Third." And then she was gone through her bedroom door.  
明日香朝他微微一笑，还没等他开口或做出任何反应，她已经倾身向前，轻轻吻了他的唇。“晚安，第三。”随后她便消失在自己的卧室门后。

He blinked stupidly a couple of times before he realized what just happened. She had snuck in a surprise kiss again! And he was still no closer to asking than he was that afternoon!  
他呆呆地眨了几下眼，才意识到刚刚发生了什么。她又偷偷给了他一个惊喜之吻！而他依然没有比下午更接近于开口询问！

"Argh!" “啊！”

"Did you say something, Shinji-kun?" Misato called from the living room.  
“你刚才说什么了吗，真嗣君？”美里从客厅喊道。

Shinji banged his head softly against the wall next to his bedroom door. "No," he said. "Not a damned thing," he added under his breath.  
真嗣轻轻地用头撞了撞卧室门旁的墙壁。“没有，”他说，“什么都没说。”他低声补充道。

---

Shinji felt paranoid and overly cautious the next morning. He woke up bright and early—earlier than usual, made the bentos and breakfast, and was eating some toast when his other two roommates joined him. Misato looked better than she had yesterday, probably because she slept the day away. Asuka looked normal and nonchalant. She reached for the few pieces of toast on the plate and gobbled it down quickly.  
第二天早上，真嗣感到多疑且过分谨慎。他早早醒来——比平时更早，做好了便当和早餐，当他的另外两位室友加入他时，他正在吃着吐司。美里看起来比昨天好多了，可能是因为她睡了一整天。明日香看起来正常且漫不经心。她伸手去拿盘子里仅剩的几片吐司，迅速地吞了下去。

She probably noticed him watching her every move as she looked at him from over the rim of her glass of orange juice. "_What_!"  
"她大概注意到了他正盯着她的一举一动，因为她从橙汁杯沿上方看向他。“干嘛！””

He jumped at having been caught staring and muttered a small, "Nothing."  
"他被抓到盯着看时吓了一跳，小声咕哝了一句，“没什么。””

She huffed at him and resumed eating, but when Shinji dared to steal another glance at her, he realized that she was smirking at him from across the table. She knew exactly why he was jumpy and just why he was watching her. It unnerved Shinji.  
"她对他哼了一声，继续吃饭，但当真嗣鼓起勇气再次偷看她时，他发现她正隔着桌子对他得意地笑。她完全知道他为什么紧张，以及为什么盯着她看。这让真嗣感到不安。”

Misato remained oblivious as she wolfed down her own breakfast with a can of Yebisu beer. "Do you two need a ride to school this morning? I don't need to report in until eleven."  
美里依旧毫无察觉，一边大口吃着自己的早餐，一边喝着一罐 Yebisu 啤酒。“你们俩今早需要我送你们去学校吗？我十一点才需要报到。”

Shinji felt rather tired due to his paranoia and his early morning and was about to readily agree when Asuka's answer dashed all his hopes.  
由于多疑和早起，真嗣感到相当疲惫，正要欣然同意时，明日香的话粉碎了他所有的希望。

"Nope. Me and baka will be fine on our own."  
“不用。我和笨蛋自己能行。”

"Are you sure?" asked Misato.  
“你确定吗？”美里问道。

He wanted to protest. Oh how he wanted to protest since walking alone with Asuka couldn't be good, not with how she suddenly developed a habit of kissing him out of nowhere. As nice as the kisses were, Shinji was more freaked out by the fact that the boy-hater, but Kaji-lover, Asuka, decided to suddenly ambush him with kisses than walking alone with her to school. They had walked to school alone many times, but all those times were before two nights ago when all the madness started!  
他本想抗议。哦，他多么想抗议，因为和明日香单独走在一起肯定没好事，尤其是她最近突然养成了随时随地亲他的习惯。尽管那些吻很美好，但更让真嗣感到惊慌的是，那个讨厌男生却钟情于加持的明日香，竟然决定突然用吻来袭击他，这比和她单独去学校更让他不安。他们曾多次单独步行去学校，但那些都是在两天前一切疯狂开始之前的事了！

A pointed look shot in Shinji's direction was all the answer he needed. "No," said Shinji, deflated.  
一道锐利的目光射向真嗣，这就是他需要的全部回答。“不，”真嗣沮丧地说。

Asuka wore a smug expression during their walk to school that morning. Shinji grumbled under his breath and purposely kept a large enough distance between them in case he needed to run for it. Asuka seemed to have other ideas because every time he seemed to reach a certain distance away from her, she'd just go and decrease it again. It was frightening.  
那天早上，在去学校的路上，明日香脸上挂着得意的表情。真嗣低声抱怨着，故意与她保持足够远的距离，以防需要逃跑。明日香似乎有别的打算，因为每当他似乎与她拉开一定距离时，她就会再次缩短这个距离。这真是令人害怕。

"What's with yer face? You look like yer about ta crap in yer pants," said Touji.  
“你那是什么表情？看起来像是要尿裤子了，” 冬二说道。

Shinji grimaced at the mental image and discretely pointed a finger to his right.  
真嗣对这心理画面皱了皱眉，悄悄地向右边指了指。

Touji followed the direction he was guided to raised an eyebrow. "Da devil? What'd she do now?"  
冬二顺着被指引的方向挑了挑眉。“那个恶魔？她又干了什么？”

Shinji was about to answer when Kensuke joined the group and dropped his bag loudly onto his desk.  
真嗣正要回答，这时健介加入了他们，大声地把书包扔到自己的桌子上。

"So, what'd I miss?" “那么，我错过了什么？”

Shinji frowned. He didn't particularly want to voice out his fears, but if it meant having to repeat it one time less then he supposed it wasn't too bad. "You won't believe what I'm going to tell you, but I swear it's all true."  
真嗣皱了皱眉。他并不特别想说出自己的恐惧，但如果这意味着可以少说一遍，那他觉得还不算太糟。“你不会相信我要告诉你的事，但我发誓这都是真的。”

Both Kensuke and Touji looked intrigued. "Does this have anything to do with yesterday?"  
健介和透治都显得很好奇。“这和昨天的事有关吗？”

He grimaced. Oh, it had more to do than just yesterday. It all started that night! "What would you say if Asuka suddenly decided she wanted to kiss me?"  
他苦笑了一下。哦，这可不仅仅是昨天的事。一切都始于那个晚上！“如果明日香突然决定她想吻我，你会怎么说？”

As expected, the two boys guffawed at the question they assumed to be rhetorical.  
不出所料，两个男孩对这个他们认为无需回答的问题大笑起来。

"Yer jokin' right?" “你开玩笑的吧？”

Shinji grumbled under his breath. "I wish I were." He sighed and began his story. "Two nights ago, Asuka wanted to try kissing."  
真嗣低声咕哝着。“我倒希望是。”他叹了口气，开始讲述他的故事。“两天前，明日香想试试接吻。”

"Are you serious?" "你是认真的吗？"

He nodded. "Dead serious. As I was saying, Asuka wanted to try kissing. It was horrible because she pinched my nose shut and I couldn't breathe at all! I felt as if I was going to die of asphyxiation!"  
他点点头。“非常认真。就像我刚才说的，明日香想试试接吻。结果糟透了，她捏住我的鼻子不让我呼吸，我简直无法呼吸！感觉自己快要窒息而死了！”

"Wait, wait, wait! What does dat have to do wit' anythin'?"  
"等等，等等，等等！这跟任何事情有什么关系？"

Shinji groaned and put his head down on his desk. "It has everything to do with it. Later that night she ambushed me and kissed me again."  
真嗣呻吟着把头埋在桌上。“这跟它有莫大的关系。那天晚上她突然袭击我，又吻了我一次。”

"With your nose pinched?"  
“捏着鼻子吗？”

"No! Not with my nose pinched!"  
“不！不是捏着鼻子！”

"Sorry. Continue." "对不起。继续。"

"I thought it was all a dream, because seriously, what were the chances of Asuka kissing _me_ of all people twice in one night after the first disaster?"  
"我以为那都是梦，因为说真的，明日香怎么可能在一夜之间两次亲我这种人，还是在第一次灾难之后？"

"As much as Kensuke's chances of gettin' picked to pilot an EVA?"  
"就像健介被选中驾驶 EVA 的几率一样大？"

"Hey! I totally have a high chance of getting picked!"  
"嘿！我被选中的几率绝对很高！"

Both Shinji and Touji decided not to comment on that.  
真嗣和渡边都决定对此不发表评论。

"Yeah, I know right? Very slim chances. But here's the thing! The next morning right as we were leaving for school she kissed me again!" said Shinji.  
"是啊，我知道对吧？机会渺茫。但重点是！第二天早上我们正要去学校时，她又吻了我一次！" 真嗣说道。

Kensuke and Touji looked at him as if he grew another head. "No way…"  
健介和透治看着他，仿佛他头上又长出了一个脑袋。“不可能……”

Shinji sighed. "See? I told you that you wouldn't believe me… Then on the way back home she stole another kiss! I wanted to ask her what that was all about but then right when I got the courage to ask, Misato ruined it. I hadn't been able to ask since."  
真嗣叹了口气。“看吧？我就说你们不会相信我的……然后回家的路上她又偷亲了我一次！我想问她那是什么意思，但就在我鼓起勇气要问的时候，美里破坏了气氛。从那以后我就一直没能问出口。”

Both his friends looked skeptical, as if they weren't sure that his story was true even though he claimed it was. "So…"  
他的两个朋友看起来仍然半信半疑，尽管他声称这是真的，他们似乎还是不太确定他的故事是否属实。“所以……”

Shinji grumbled under his breath again. He knew that they wouldn't believe him. Maybe he shouldn't have told them after all…  
真嗣又低声抱怨起来。他知道他们不会相信他的。也许他根本就不该告诉他们……

"Was she a good kisser?" said Touji with a grin.  
“她接吻技术好吗？” 托吉笑着问。

Shinji pounded his head on his desk. Hopefully Asuka hadn't heard a word of their conversation; otherwise it'd be hell when it was time to go home.  
真嗣把头重重地撞在桌子上。希望明日香一个字也没听到他们的对话；否则回家时可就惨了。

---

Shinji dreaded lunch time. His friends wouldn't stop making fun of him and his outlandish story, as they had come to call it. Sick of being teased, the moment he finished his lunch he left the classroom. The halls were sparse with very few people around. It was nice and Shinji drank in the peace as he strolled down the hall and away from the stuffy classroom.  
真嗣害怕午餐时间。他的朋友们不停地取笑他，还有他们所谓的他那离奇的故事。厌倦了被嘲笑，他一吃完午饭就离开了教室。走廊上人迹稀少，非常安静，真嗣享受着这份宁静，漫步在走廊上，远离了闷热的教室。

He wasn't exactly sure where he was heading, but anywhere was fine with him. He allowed his feet to guide him around on the familiar school grounds.  
他并不确切知道自己要去哪里，但任何地方对他来说都无所谓。他任由双脚带领自己在熟悉的校园里四处游走。

Suddenly there were footsteps behind him. Shinji furrowed his brow. He thought that he was going to be alone and turned around to see who it was. His heart froze and jumped up to his throat. Coming at him was Asuka and she had _that_ look in her eye.  
突然，他听到身后有脚步声。真嗣皱起眉头，以为自己会独自一人，转身一看是谁。他的心跳几乎停止，又猛地跳到了喉咙口。向他走来的是明日香，她的眼神中带着那种神情。

He quickly took stock of his surroundings and realized that if he was able to run fast enough maybe he'd be able to reach the staircase and then make a run for it. Yes, that was a good plan. Shinji barely gotten in three steps before Asuka overtook him. Was he that unfit compared to his roommate? Apparently he was, but that was the least of his worries as she gripped the front of his shirt and looked at him with _that_ look.  
他迅速环顾四周，意识到如果他能跑得足够快，也许就能到达楼梯，然后逃之夭夭。是的，这是个好计划。真嗣才迈出三步，就被明日香赶超了。难道他比室友差那么多吗？显然是的，但这已是他最不担心的事了，因为她抓住他的衬衫前襟，用那种眼神看着他。

"A-Asu—" “明——明日香——”

Her lips descended upon his and his mind suddenly went blank and hazy. A wave of euphoria passed through him and for some reason he was having trouble standing because his knees felt weak, let alone remember what his name was. What was his name again?  
她的唇覆上了他的，他的思绪突然变得空白而模糊。一阵狂喜涌过全身，不知为何他站立不稳，膝盖发软，连自己的名字都记不起来了。他叫什么来着？

A strangled yelp broke through the haze in his mind and Asuka reluctantly pulled away from him to look at the source of the noise.  
一声窒息般的惊叫穿透了他脑海中的迷雾，明日香不情愿地从他身边抽离，望向噪音的来源。

Down the corridor Touji and Kensuke had their eyes wide open in disbelief and were making strangled noises in their throat, as if unable to even speak let alone comprehend what they had just seen.  
走廊那头，真治和健司瞪大了眼睛，难以置信地看着，喉咙里发出窒息般的声音，仿佛连话都说不出来，更别提理解刚刚所见的一幕。

Shinji expected them to recover any minute now and run up to them, demanding to know what was going on, even though he told them this morning. Instead, the two boys' eyes rolled up to the back of their heads until the whites were showing and then they fainted. Shinji's jaw dropped open in disbelief. Some friends they were!  
真嗣以为他们随时会恢复过来，冲上前质问发生了什么，尽管他今早已经告诉过他们。然而，两个男孩的眼睛翻到后脑勺，只露出眼白，然后就晕了过去。真嗣的下巴惊讶得张开。真是些靠不住的朋友！

During his distraction Asuka had yanked onto his shirt again until he faced her and then kissed him again. This time he definitely felt something wet in his mouth and _he_ fainted.  
在他分神之际，明日香再次猛拉他的衬衫，直到他面对她，然后又吻了他。这次他确实感觉到嘴里有些湿润的东西，然后就晕了过去。

---

"Asuka, have you seen Suzuhara, Aida, or Ikari?" asked Hikari. "Class is about to start."  
“明日香，你看到铃原、相田或者碇了吗？” 美里问道，“课就要开始了。”

Asuka shrugged and sat down at her desk. "They fainted in the halls."  
明日香耸了耸肩，坐在自己的座位上。“他们在走廊里晕倒了。”

"They what!" "他们什么！"

She shrugged again. "I don't know. They must've seen something shocking."  
她又耸了耸肩。"我不知道。他们一定是看到了什么令人震惊的东西。"

Hikari was out the door in a matter of seconds and missed the amused smile on her friend's face.  
光在几秒钟内就冲出了门，错过了她朋友脸上那抹得意的微笑。

---

The following synchronization test was uncomfortable. One, because Shinji could hardly concentrate and was being berated left and right for that; Two, every time he even so much as looked at Asuka, she'd send him this smirk and his face would end up glowing like a giant red light bulb. It was not pretty. And three, when he was asked by Ayanami, Misato, _and_ Dr. Akagi why he was having trouble focusing, he had no answer to give. After all, it wasn't as if he could say 'Why, I'm having trouble concentrating because I keep thinking about Asuka kissing me!' Oh yes, that would go over well…  
接下来的同步测试让人很不舒服。一来，因为真嗣几乎无法集中注意力，而且因此被左右夹击地责骂；二来，每次他哪怕只是看向明日香，她都会对他露出那种得意的笑容，让他的脸红得像个大红灯泡。那场面可不怎么好看。再者，当绫波、美里和赤木博士问他为什么难以集中注意力时，他无言以对。毕竟，他总不能说‘为什么，我难以集中注意力是因为我一直在想明日香吻我的事！’哦，是的，那样说肯定很合适……

Shinji snorted at the thought and tried his best to calm his racing mind and to focus on the test. It was hard.  
想到这里，真嗣哼了一声，尽力平复自己狂跳的心思，专注于测试。这很难。

In the end, Asuka came out on top. He had barely scored above Ayanami who had scored rather constantly since they first began synchronization testing months back. Shinji felt his face burn in embarrassment when he was reprimanded for his lack of attention.  
最终，明日香拔得头筹。他的分数勉强超过了绫波，而绫波自从几个月前他们开始同步测试以来，成绩一直相当稳定。真嗣因注意力不集中而受到训斥时，感到脸上火辣辣的，羞愧难当。

Asuka had been grinning the whole time, but no one noticed a difference and passed it off as her sadism for watching her co-worker get reprimanded.  
明日香全程都在咧嘴笑，但没人注意到这一点，只当是她看到同事被训斥时的施虐心理作祟。

Shinji sighed tiredly once he was allowed to go shower and change. It had been a long day.  
获准去洗澡换衣服后，真嗣疲惫地叹了口气。今天真是漫长的一天。

"Cheer up, baka!" said Asuka with a pat to his back. Except her pats were more forceful than normal and sent Shinji stumbling forward a couple of steps.  
“振作点，笨蛋！”明日香说着拍了拍他的背。只是她的拍打比平时更有力，让真嗣踉跄了几步。

Ayanami approached him from the other side and said, "Ikari-kun. It has come to my notice that you were not concentrating well at all during today's exam. May I ask if there is something bothering you?"  
绫波从另一侧走近他，说道：“碇君，我注意到你今天考试时完全没有集中注意力。请问是有什么事情困扰着你吗？”

There definitely was something bothering him, but how was he supposed to respond? He didn't bother to look at Asuka to know what she thought. With a mental sigh, Shinji said, "I'm fine, Ayanami, just tired. Thanks for the concern."  
确实有事情困扰着他，但他该如何回应呢？他没有费心去看明日香的想法。心中叹了口气，真嗣回答道：“我没事，绫波，只是有点累。谢谢你的关心。”

She didn't look convinced and looked suspiciously at Asuka for a few moments. "If you ever wish to discuss anything, feel free to seek me out."  
她看起来并不相信，怀疑地看了明日香几眼。“如果你愿意讨论任何事情，随时可以来找我。”

"I will, Rei." Shinji nodded gratefully and watched his other fellow pilot disappear with a small smile down the corridors to the locker rooms. Beside him Asuka huffed and stormed ahead of him. Shinji raised his brows in confusion. What'd he do _now_? He thought that declining Ayanami's offer was what she wanted so why was Asuka so huffy about it? Shinji shook his head disappointedly. He just didn't understand girls.  
“我会去的，丽。”真嗣感激地点点头，看着他的另一位驾驶员带着一丝微笑消失在通往更衣室的走廊里。旁边的明日香哼了一声，气冲冲地走在他前面。真嗣困惑地挑起眉毛。他现在又做错了什么？他以为拒绝了绫波的邀请是明日香想要的，但为什么她会这么生气呢？真嗣失望地摇了摇头。他就是搞不懂女孩子。

---

Asuka appeared angry with him for the rest of the week and refused to even acknowledge him. It was a quiet but very strained week as Shinji performed his usual household chores. He had long decided that the apartment was better off if he did them than allow Misato to take charge. He shuddered at the one time he came home after Misato's cleaning spree.  
整个星期，明日香都对他怒气冲冲，甚至拒绝和他打招呼。这一周虽然安静，但气氛非常紧张，真嗣照常做着家务。他早就决定，与其让美里来负责，不如他自己来做这些事。他一想到那次美里大扫除后他回家的情景就打了个寒颤。

His synch ratio was back to normal levels and fortunately, neither Dr. Akagi nor Misato commented on it. The latest test showed that he had surpassed Asuka and that had put her in a surly mood all day, even more than usual. He supposed that that was to be expected since Asuka had prided herself on being the best, but it still hurt that she treated him so coldly these days. It felt as if he was the bane of her existence.  
他的同步率恢复到了正常水平，幸运的是，无论是赤木律子博士还是美里都没有对此发表评论。最近的测试显示他已经超过了明日香，这让她的心情一整天都比平时更加阴沉。他猜想这是可以预料的，因为明日香一直以自己是最优秀的为傲，但看到她这些天如此冷淡地对待他，他还是感到心痛。感觉自己就像是她存在的祸根。

Shinji didn't have much time to contemplate it though because the next Angel attacked before anyone was ready and they were in their entry plugs in no time. The Angel was large and round with a giant shadow. No one was sure if they could even get close to the Angel.  
然而，真嗣并没有太多时间去深思，因为下一个使徒在众人毫无准备的情况下突然袭击，他们迅速进入了插入栓。这个使徒体型庞大且呈圆形，带着巨大的阴影。没有人确定是否能接近它。

In the end Shinji had decided to launch headfirst toward the Angel and he learned just how poorly his judgment was when he found his EVA sinking into that dark shadow with no way out.  
最终，真嗣决定直接向使徒发起冲击，当他发现自己驾驶的 EVA 陷入那片黑暗阴影无法脱身时，他才意识到自己的判断有多么糟糕。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

---

He felt tired. Oh so tired. His eyes drifted shut but he willed them to open again. It wouldn't do to fall asleep now, not that his life was about to end. It was over twelve hours since he was sucked in and he had put his EVA into life-support mode. At best he'd last sixteen hours. A quick glance at his plug suit informed him that there was less than an hour left. The Angel showed no signs of moving and his umbilical cable and been severed hours ago. Was he going to make it? Probably not.  
他感到无比疲惫。非常非常疲惫。眼皮沉重地合上，但他强迫自己再次睁开。现在睡着可不是明智之举，尽管他的生命即将走到尽头。自从被吸入阴影中已经过去了超过十二个小时，他将 EVA 切换到了生命维持模式。最多只能坚持十六个小时。快速查看了一下插入栓内的计时器，他得知自己剩下的时间不足一小时。使徒毫无动静，他的脐带电缆也在几小时前被切断。他能挺过去吗？恐怕不能。

Shinji felt disgusted with himself for getting all arrogant because he had surpassed Asuka in the last synchronization test. It was one test out of many and he was still years behind in experience compared to her. She controlled her EVA so gracefully in ways that he could only dream of controlling his.  
真嗣因为在上一次同步测试中超越了明日香而感到自大，这让他对自己感到厌恶。这只是众多测试中的一次，与她相比，他在经验上仍然落后多年。她操控 EVA 的方式优雅至极，而他只能梦想着能那样操控自己的 EVA。

Speaking of Asuka, they hadn't exactly parted on good terms. She had still been angry with him when this whole fiasco had started and he'd hate to have Asuka hating him still as his last memory. But it wouldn't do him any good now. He was stuck and he was just so _tired_. He wanted to sleep.  
说到明日香，他们并没有以良好的关系分开。在这场混乱开始时，她仍然对他生气，他讨厌在最后的记忆中明日香依然恨他。但现在这对他没有任何好处。他被困住了，他只是太累了。他想睡觉。

"_Baka Shinji!"_ “笨蛋真嗣！”

He jumped at the voice and looked around his EVA. There was nothing on the screens or channels. It was still on life-support mode and he was disconnected with the outside world. His eyes started drifting shut again.  
他被那声音吓了一跳，环顾自己的 EVA 内部。屏幕和通讯频道上什么也没有。EVA 仍处于生命维持模式，他与外界断开了联系。他的眼睛又开始渐渐闭上。

"_Baka Shinji!"_ “笨蛋真嗣！”

There it was again. That voice, except none of the communication channels were on.  
那个声音又出现了。除了所有的通讯频道都没有开启。

"_Baka Shinji! Come back, you bastard! How could you just go and run off like that?"_  
"笨蛋真嗣！回来，你这个混蛋！你怎么能就这样跑掉？"

"_How could you just jump headlong into something without thinking first? Just because you surpassed my synch ratio doesn't mean that you're better than me!"_  
"你怎么能不加思考就一头扎进去？就算你同步率超过了我，也不代表你就比我强！"

Shinji rolled his eyes. He had no doubts who this voice belonged to. The question was, _where_ was the voice coming from?  
真嗣翻了个白眼。他毫不怀疑这声音的主人是谁。问题在于，这声音是从哪儿传来的？

"_You stupid bastard! You coward!"_  
"你这个蠢货！懦夫！"

Her voice sounded sad even as she screamed those things at him. Right now he didn't care where the voice was coming from, but if it was going to be his last few minutes of life he'd much rather hear anyone's voice, even Asuka's angry berating of him, before he left.  
她的声音即使在尖叫中听起来也带着悲伤。此刻他不在乎这声音来自何方，但如果这是他生命的最后几分钟，他宁愿听到任何人的声音，哪怕是明日香对他的愤怒责骂，在他离开之前。

"_You bastard…!"_ This time her voice sounded broken and hoarse as if she had cried. _"How could you leave me like that!"_  
"你这个混蛋…！"" 这次她的声音听起来破碎而沙哑，仿佛她已经哭泣过。""你怎么能那样离开我！"

He didn't want to. He regretted getting ahead of himself and biting off more than he could chew. That was definitely a bad idea.  
他并不想这么做。他后悔自己操之过急，咬下了超过他能咀嚼的分量。这绝对是个糟糕的主意。

"_I don't care if you have a higher synch ratio than me! I don't care that you're a stupid dumbass! I don't care if you like Wondergirl! Just get your ass back!"_  
“我才不在乎你的同步率比我高！我才不在乎你是个蠢货！我才不在乎你喜欢神奇女孩！赶紧给我滚回来！”

If only he knew how. He felt exhaustion take him over and his eyes closed of their own accord.  
如果他知道该怎么做就好了。他感到疲惫席卷而来，眼皮不由自主地闭上了。

There was silence for a few long moments. Shinji almost thought that the connection had finally cut, wherever it was coming from, and that he'd be left alone in silence in his last few minutes of life.  
沉默持续了几个漫长的瞬间。真嗣几乎以为那不知从何而来的联系终于断开了，他将在寂静中独自度过生命的最后几分钟。

"_If you want to know why I kissed you all those times, then get your ass back right now!"_  
“如果你想弄清楚我为什么吻你那么多次，那就赶紧滚回来！”

Shinji smiled wryly. Of course he wanted to know. But how was he supposed to tell her that? How was he supposed to leave here anyway?  
真嗣苦笑了一下。他当然想知道。但他该怎么告诉她呢？他又该如何离开这里呢？

He opened his mouth as if to talk, even if the connection was only one-sided, he still wanted to try to get his message across. A great murky feeling entered his throat and he choked violently. The LCL in the plug was no longer the translucent amber he was used to seeing, but a murky brown with particles of _something_ floating about. He choked and coughed violently as he realized that the LCL filtering system had most likely just crashed.  
他张开嘴，仿佛要说话，尽管连接是单向的，他仍想尝试传达自己的信息。一股浓重的混浊感涌入喉咙，他剧烈地呛咳起来。插入栓中的 LCL 不再是熟悉的半透明琥珀色，而是浑浊的棕色，夹杂着漂浮的颗粒。他意识到，LCL 过滤系统很可能刚刚崩溃了，于是更加剧烈地咳嗽起来。

His world was starting to turn black and he couldn't stop coughing. Was this really the end?  
他的世界开始变得漆黑，咳嗽也无法停止。这真的就是终点了吗？

---

His body felt tired and heavy. Even his eyelids felt heavy. Wait… how would he still be able to feel tired or the heaviness of his body if he was dead? Shinji slowly opened his eyes. The world was bleary and was that a ceiling? It looked sort of familiar. After a while his vision cleared and he realized with a start that the ceiling belonged to the NERV infirmary. If he was here, then that meant that he was alive?  
他的身体感到疲惫而沉重。就连眼皮也感觉沉重。等等……如果他已经死了，怎么还能感到疲惫或身体的沉重呢？真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛。世界模糊不清，那是一片天花板吗？看起来有点熟悉。过了一会儿，他的视线清晰起来，他突然意识到那片天花板属于 NERV 的医务室。如果他在这里，那就意味着他还活着？

He turned his head slightly and saw a head of red hair buried into his side.  
他微微侧过头，看到一抹红发埋在自己的身侧。

"A-Asu…ka?" “阿…苏卡？”

She shifted in her sleep for a few seconds before consciousness took over and she looked at him with eyes full of mixed emotions that he couldn't identify. There was one that he was quite familiar with though.  
她在睡梦中动了动，几秒钟后意识逐渐清醒，用充满他无法辨认的复杂情感的眼睛看着他。但有一种情感他相当熟悉。

"Ow!" He clutched his arm where she had hit him.  
"哎哟！" 他紧抓着她打到的手臂。

"You bastard!" She hit him again and this time he prepared to defend himself with raising his other arm. "You bastard! How could you! How could you just rush off like that!" She hit him again. "Did you know how close we were to losing you?" She held her index finger and thumb a mere half centimeter apart. "This close!"  
"你这个混蛋！" 她再次打向他，这次他举起另一只手臂准备自卫。"你这个混蛋！你怎么能！你怎么能就这样冲出去！" 她又打了他一下。"你知道我们差点就失去你了吗？" 她用食指和拇指比划出仅半厘米的距离。"这么近！"

He stared at her blankly. "…But the Angel…"  
他茫然地盯着她。"…但天使…"

"Screw the Angel!" "去他的天使！"

Shinji cringed from the volume of her voice.  
真嗣被她的高音量吓得缩了一下。

"If your EVA hadn't gone beserker you'd be dead and so would the rest of Tokyo-3!"  
"要不是你的 EVA 发狂，你早就死了，连同整个第三新东京市一起！"

He stayed quiet as the full effect of her words sank in. He hadn't died and the Angel was destroyed… by his beserker EVA. Everyone was alive. Everyone was safe. He let out the breath he didn't know he was holding and sighed in relief.  
他静静地待着，任由她的话完全渗透进心里。他没有死，使徒也被他的狂暴 EVA 摧毁了……所有人都活着。所有人都安全了。他吐出了那口不知何时憋住的气，松了一口气。

"Don't you have anything to say for yourself?"  
“你就没有什么要为自己辩解的吗？”

There were tears in her eyes and Shinji realized that this was the first time he had ever seen her cry in all the months he'd known her. His mouth hung open uselessly as he tried to put together words, but failing miserably. Eventually he was able to croak out, "Sorry."  
她的眼中有泪光，真嗣意识到这是他认识她几个月以来第一次看到她哭。他的嘴张开却无言以对，努力想拼凑出话语，却失败得一塌糊涂。最终，他勉强挤出了一个词：“对不起。”

"I'm sorry. I was an idiot," said Shinji. "I'll never do something so stupid again."  
"对不起，我真是个白痴，" 真嗣说道，"我再也不会做这么蠢的事了。"

"Damn right you won't!" She hit him again, but he didn't protest. He knew he deserved it.  
"你最好别再犯傻！" 她又打了他一下，但他没有抗议。他知道自己活该。"

What she did next surprised him. She launched herself at him and pulled him into a tight embrace.  
她接下来的举动让他吃了一惊。她猛地扑向他，紧紧地抱住了他。

All the breath left his lungs, but he didn't care. His brain was still trying to wrap itself around the idea that Asuka was _hugging_ him! "Don't you ever leave me again," she said softly.  
所有的呼吸都离开了他的肺，但他并不在意。他的大脑仍在努力接受这个事实——明日香在拥抱他！“你再也不要离开我了，”她轻声说道。

He nodded dumbly, but then he remembered her words.  
他木讷地点了点头，但随后想起了她的话。

"_How could you leave me like that!"_  
“你怎么能那样离开我！”

"_I don't care if you have a higher synch ratio than me! I don't care that you're a stupid dumbass! I don't care if you like Wondergirl! Just get your ass back!"_  
"我才不在乎你的同步率比我高呢！我才不在乎你是个蠢货！我才不在乎你喜欢神奇女孩！快给我滚回来！"

"_If you want to know why I kissed you all those times, then get your ass back right now!"_  
"如果你想弄清楚我为什么吻你那么多次，那就立刻给我滚回来！"

Did he dream all of that up? There was only one way to find out.  
那些都是他梦到的吗？只有一种方法能弄清楚。

He gulped nervously. "Did you really mean it, Asuka?"  
他紧张地咽了咽口水。“你真的那么说，明日香？”

She pulled away to look at him in confusion.  
她退开一步，困惑地看着他。

"Do you really not care that I beat your synch ratio? Or that I like Ayanami?"  
“你真的不在乎我超过了你的同步率吗？还是说，你不在乎我喜欢绫波？”

Her face turned pink. "Y-you heard that? I thought your communication system was down."  
她的脸颊泛起了红晕。“你……你听到了？我以为你的通讯系统已经坏了。”

"I thought so too, but I guess our channel wasn't fully closed from before I jumped in and it was the only channel to stay open…"  
“我也这么认为，但看来我跳进来之前，我们的频道并没有完全关闭，而且这是唯一保持畅通的……”

The next few moments were awkward as Asuka turned pink from realizing that her desperate pleas to Shinji had been heard and Shinji blushed in embarrassment as her last line continued to repeat through his head. Shinji hadn't realized that Asuka blushed until now since she made it a goal to never be embarrassed. So the only times he had ever seen her face pink from anything was from the sun and from anger. Now though, was something totally new and alien to him. She looked cute.  
接下来的几秒钟尴尬至极，因为意识到自己的绝望呼唤被真嗣听到了，明日香的脸颊红得发烫，而真嗣则因为她的最后一句话在脑海中不断回响而尴尬得脸红。真嗣之前从未注意到明日香会脸红，因为她总是刻意避免尴尬。因此，他唯一见过她脸红的时刻，要么是因为阳光，要么是因为愤怒。但现在，这一切对他来说完全是新鲜而陌生的。她看起来很可爱。

"Asuka." “明日香。”

She hesitantly met his gaze and was surprised to see it soft and warm.  
她犹豫地迎上他的目光，惊讶地发现他的眼神柔和而温暖。

"My ass is back." “我的屁股回来了。”

She stared blankly at him. What was that supposed to mean?  
她茫然地盯着他。这到底是什么意思？

"My ass is back." He leaned forward slightly and wrapped his arms around her waist while hers hung loosely by his sides from earlier and prevented her escape. "So, care to tell me why you decided to go on a kissing spree?"  
"我的屁股回来了。" 他微微前倾，双臂环抱住她的腰，而她的手则懒散地垂在他两侧，早先的动作阻止了她的逃离。"那么，愿意告诉我为什么你决定开始一场接吻狂欢吗？"

Her face turned pinker and she tried to pull away but he had anticipated that action and pulled her back toward him, effectively preventing her escape.  
她的脸变得更红了，试图挣脱，但他早已预料到这一举动，将她拉回自己身边，有效地阻止了她的逃脱。

"I did say that I'd tell you why, didn't I?"  
"我确实说过我会告诉你原因，不是吗？"

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

Groaning in embarrassment, Asuka averted her gaze to a spot over his shoulder. "I kissed you all those times because…"  
阿斯克羞愧地低声抱怨，目光移向他的肩膀上方。“我那么多次吻你是因为……”

"Because…?" “因为……？”

Her eyebrow twitched. He wasn't going to make this easy on her.  
她的眉毛微微抽动。他不会让她轻易过关的。

"If it was for a prank, it's not funny."  
"如果是恶作剧，那就不好笑了。"

"It's not a prank!" Her face turned even pinker, if that was possible. "Though your face was priceless and was half the reason I continued to kiss you."  
"这不是恶作剧！"" 她的脸变得更红了，如果那还有可能的话。""虽然你的表情太精彩了，这也是我继续吻你的部分原因。"

He rolled his eyes at the latter comment and purposely chose to ignore it. "Then?"  
他对后一句话翻了个白眼，故意选择忽略它。""那么？"

She bit her bottom lip softly in her unease. "Because I like you," she finally said in a small voice. "It took me a lot of courage and I had to put aside a lot of pride to admit that, so I hope you're happy!"  
她轻轻咬住下唇，显得有些不安。“因为我喜欢你，”她终于小声说道，“承认这一点我鼓起了很大的勇气，也放下了很多自尊，所以希望你能开心！”

Shinji could only blink and look at her in amazement.  
真嗣只能眨眨眼，惊讶地看着她。

"After our first kiss… I sort of admitted to myself that I liked you and somehow I ended up wanting to kiss you more."  
“在我们第一次接吻之后……我好像对自己承认了喜欢你，不知怎么地，我就越来越想吻你。”

"So you attacked me." "所以你攻击了我。"

"I didn't attack you!" "我没有攻击你！"

He shot her a pointed look, which was strange on Shinji, but suited the situation.  
他向她投去一个尖锐的目光，这在真嗣身上颇为罕见，但在此情此景下却恰如其分。

"Okay, maybe I did once or twice."  
“好吧，也许我确实有一两次。”

He shot her another pointed look.  
他又向她投去一个意味深长的眼神。

She glared at him. "Fine, more than once or twice!"  
她瞪着他。“好吧，不止一两次！”

"Why Asuka, I had no idea you liked me so much," he said with a mischievous grin.  
"为什么是明日香，我完全不知道你这么喜欢我呢，"他带着一丝调皮的笑容说道。

"Your ego is getting too big, Ikari."  
"你的自信心膨胀过头了，碇。"

He merely grinned back at her and then leaned forward until their foreheads were touching. "What would you say if I liked you too?" He could hear her breath hitch in her throat and let out a soft chuckle. "If you liked me, all you had to do was say so. You didn't need to attack me with kisses, though that isn't so bad now that I think about it…"  
他只是回以微笑，然后向前倾身，直到两人的额头相触。"如果我也喜欢你，你会怎么说？"他能听到她的呼吸一窒，轻声笑了出来。"如果你喜欢我，直接说出来就好了。你不需要用亲吻来攻击我，不过现在想想，这也不算太糟……"

She hit him. 她打了他。

Shinji leaned forward and pressed his lips against hers and instantly he could feel her body relaxing. When he pulled away, there was a large grin on her face.  
真嗣向前倾身，将唇贴在她的唇上，立刻感觉到她的身体放松了。当他离开时，她的脸上露出了大大的笑容。

"I believe that was the first time you've ever initiated the kiss and damn, you're good."  
“我相信那是你第一次主动亲吻，该死，你做得真好。”

"Oh, good! And here I thought I was so bad that I scared you away after our first kiss."  
"哦，太好了！我还以为我糟糕到第一次接吻就把你吓跑了呢。"

She grinned and leaned in for another kiss.  
她咧嘴一笑，又凑上前去亲吻。

A large shriek was heard from the side of the room. The two teens broke apart and turned to the doorway where their guardian was standing with wide-eyes and her mouth looked as if it was going to unhinge herself any minute now. "Y-y-you t-t-two…" Then, she fainted.  
房间一侧突然传来一声尖叫。两个少年分开，转向门口，只见他们的监护人站在那里，瞪大了眼睛，嘴巴张得仿佛随时会脱臼。“你……你们俩……”紧接着，她晕了过去。

"How long do you think she was standing there?" asked Shinji.  
"你觉得她在那儿站了多久？" 真嗣问道。

"Long enough for a heart attack…"  
"久到足以让人心脏病发作……"

"Oops." "哎呀。"
