"It's raining..." "下雨了..."

Shinji Ikari sighed deeply, head bowed. He didn't normally mind the rain... but the storm had come suddenly and without warning, not to mention its furious downpour was battering the school windows, making him _not_ want to leave the classroom, for the first time.  
碇真嗣深深地叹了口气，头低垂着。他通常并不介意下雨...但这场暴风雨来得突然且毫无预警，更不用说那猛烈的倾盆大雨正敲打着学校窗户，让他第一次不想离开教室。

"Ah crap... at least I left my umbrella in my locker." Touji Suzuhara muttered, glancing at his melancholy friend. "What about you?"  
"啊糟糕...至少我把伞留在储物柜里了。" 铃原东治喃喃自语，瞥了一眼他忧郁的朋友。"你呢？"

"Nah... I forgot mine." The Third Child replied, placing his head down.  
“没，我忘带了。”第三适格者回答道，低下头来。

Kensuke Aida gave him a sympathetic look, and tried to find a way to cheer (well, make less somber) his friend. "Well, at the very least, you can have Misato run up a hot bath for you..."  
相田剑介同情地看了他一眼，试图找到一种方式来安慰（或者说，让他的朋友不那么沮丧）。“好吧，至少你可以让美里给你准备一个热水澡……”

Unfortunately, even that blatantly suggestive scenario could not get a rise out of Shinji today.  
不幸的是，即使是这种明显带有暗示性的情景，今天也没能让真嗣振作起来。

On the other side of the classroom, a certain redhead had overheard the conversations of the trio, and glanced down to her bag. She, fortunately, was smart enough to have listened to the radio this morning, and the possibility of a heavy downpour was reason enough to have an umbrella.  
在教室的另一边，某个红发女孩无意间听到了这三人的对话，目光不由自主地瞥向自己的书包。幸运的是，她今早足够聪明，听了广播，得知可能会有大雨倾盆，因此带上了雨伞。

But Asuka Langley Sohryu had two.  
但惣流·明日香·兰格雷有两把。

Of course, this was definitely not because she knew that a certain pilot of Unit 01 was probably too busy cooking and cleaning to hear the news, and absurd to think that she cared that her roommate would get completely soaked and probably sick in that rain...  
当然，这绝不是因为她知道某位驾驶初号机的驾驶员可能忙于做饭和打扫，无暇听新闻，更荒谬的是，她才不在乎她的室友会不会被雨淋得透湿，甚至因此生病呢……

No, it was _pure_ coincidence that Asuka had two umbrellas.  
不，这只是巧合，明日香恰好有两把伞。

"You should give one to Shinji," Hikari Horaki commented airily, reaching into her own bag for an umbrella.  
“你应该给真嗣一把，” 班长 洞木光 轻快地说道，同时从自己的包里拿出一把伞。

While the expected sputter and German expletives about "that idiot" were expected, the Class Rep raised an eyebrow at the blush that announced its existence on Asuka's cheeks.  
虽然预料中的咕哝声和关于“那个白痴”的德语咒骂如期而至，但班长对明日香脸颊上显露出的红晕挑了挑眉。

"This is the perfect opportunity, Asuka!" Hikari whispered conspiratorially, leaning forward. "He needs an umbrella, you have an extra... come on!"  
"这可是绝佳的机会，明日香！" 光希低声密谋般地倾身向前，"他需要一把伞，而你正好有多余的...快点！"

Flushing and trying to fight the warmth that passed over her body as she imagined the scenario playing out in her mind, the Second Child merely muttered, "Who says I even care..."  
明日香脸颊泛红，试图抑制住因脑海中想象着这一幕而涌遍全身的暖意，只是喃喃自语道："谁说我会在意..."

Sighing, Hikari decided that a change in tactics was in order. "Well..." the brown haired girl began, "You are a genius Asuka, and the better pilot. Shinji can't be expected to think as far ahead as you, so its only natural that you look out for lesser beings." Tactic- play on the redhead's ego.  
叹了口气，光希决定改变策略。"嗯..."棕发女孩开口道，"你是天才明日香，也是更优秀的驾驶员。真嗣不可能像你那样深思熟虑，所以你照顾那些不如你的人是理所当然的。" 策略——利用红发少女的骄傲。

Eyes brightening, the pilot of Unit 02 nodded feverently, smiling slightly. "Yeah... I mean, that idiot can't even take care of himself," which was strange, considering he cooked and cleaned for her, "And since I am his comrade, I need to make sure he's there to back me up in the next Angel attack."  
眼中闪着光，02 号机驾驶员热切地点头，嘴角微微上扬。“是啊……我是说，那个笨蛋连自己都照顾不好，”这很奇怪，毕竟他为她做饭和打扫，“既然我是他的战友，我得确保他在下一次使徒袭击时能支持我。”

Overwhelming success. 压倒性的成功。

Fighting the urge to roll her eyes, Hikari merely nodded, watching Asuka grab both umbrellas, preparing to head out into the hallway where the Stooge trio had just entered.  
强忍住翻白眼的冲动，光只是点点头，看着明日香抓起两把伞，准备走进刚刚三傻组合进入的走廊。

Touji and Kensuke, as they were friends with Shinji, did what most other males did to help cheer their friends up.  
冬二和剑介，作为真嗣的朋友，像大多数男性一样，尽力帮助朋友振作起来。

Teased them mercilessly. 无情地调侃他们。

"Oh come on Shinji, you can't say that the idea of Misato giving you a warm bath doesn't make you at least a little hot and bothered?" Kensuke asked, grinning at his still down best friend.  
“拜托，真嗣，你不能说想到美里给你洗个热水澡不会让你至少有点心猿意马吧？”剑介问道，对着依旧情绪低落的好友咧嘴笑。

Touji, while fighting the images of the Major in that... position, decided to throw in Shinji's Achilles heel.  
在努力摆脱脑海中那位少校处于那种...姿势的影像时，冬二决定利用真嗣的致命弱点。

"Or maybe, Kensuke, our friend here wants a devil to warm him up with her Hellfire?" the jock elbowed his friend lightly, sharing a grin.  
“或者，健介，我们这位朋友想让一个恶魔用她的地狱之火给他暖暖身子？”这位运动员轻轻用肘碰了碰他的朋友，两人相视一笑。

"Maybe that was Casanova's plan, Touji. To make sure he and demon girl share an umbrella, walk close in the rain... just like the married couple they are." The spectacled boy ribbed, smirking.  
“也许那就是卡萨诺瓦的计划，冬二。确保他和那个恶魔女孩共撑一把伞，在雨中并肩而行...就像他们是一对已婚夫妇那样。”戴眼镜的男孩打趣道，脸上带着一丝坏笑。

And, like a charm, Shinji rose in protest, as he always did when teased about the "married couple" relationship he seemed to have with his redheaded roommate.  
而就像魔法一般，真嗣再次起身抗议，每当被调侃与红发室友那所谓的“夫妻”关系时，他总是如此。

"Guys, for the last time, there is nothing between me and Asuka!" the Third Child all but shouted, glaring at his friends. "It's not like that at all! We're just friends," _Well, maybe,_ "Nothing more!"  
“伙计们，最后一次声明，我和明日香之间什么都没有！”第三适格者几乎是大声喊道，瞪着他的朋友们。“根本不是那样！我们只是朋友，”好吧，也许，“仅此而已！”

Touji and Kensuke merely shot him the standard "We-know-you're-lying" looks that aggravated him further.  
东治和健介只是给了他一个标准的“我们知道你在撒谎”的眼神，这让他更加恼火。

However, they were silenced when a dark chill sucked all the warmth in the atmosphere.  
然而，当一股阴冷的寒意吸走了周围的全部温暖时，他们顿时噤声。

A pit of fear grew in the Third Child's stomach. "Guys... what's-"  
第三适格者心中生出一股恐惧。“大家...这是怎么——”

Eyes widened as Asuka stormed past the Stooges without even a word, moving so quickly that those caught in her path barely had enough time to see a scarlet blur ram into them.  
眼睛瞪得大大的，明日香怒气冲冲地从三傻身边走过，连一句话都没留下，移动速度之快，以至于那些挡在她路上的人几乎来不及看清一抹鲜红的影子撞向他们。

And Shinji was left staring after the redhead, eyes uncomprehending and staring.  
而真嗣则呆呆地望着红发女孩的背影，眼神中满是不解与茫然。

"Shinji!" Hikari shouted, grabbing the Third Child's ear in that manner that normally only Touji was forced to endure. A yelp escaped the pilot's lips, which was remarkable, considering normally Touji became a whimpering, sobbing mess when that move was executed.  
“真嗣！”光喊道，以那种通常只有冬二才不得不忍受的方式揪住了第三适格者的耳朵。一声惊叫从驾驶员的唇间逸出，这颇为难得，毕竟通常冬二在这种招数下会变成一个啜泣的可怜虫。

Then again, he lived with Asuka, not to mention took beatings from Angels many times over.  
不过话说回来，他可是和明日香同住一个屋檐下，更不用说多次承受使徒的攻击了。

"That was mean! You hurt Asuka's feelings!" the Class Rep scolded, executing step two in her Ear Twist Of Doom technique.  
“你太过分了！你伤了明日香的心！”班长责备道，施展了她那“毁灭之耳拧”的第二步。

Briefly, Touji and Kensuke, showing that Stooge bond, glanced at each other in unison, and both decided that commenting that the redhead had no feelings was not worth the agony...  
短暂地，剑介和真嗣这对傻瓜搭档默契地对视了一眼，两人都决定，说红发女孩没有感情不值得承受那痛苦……

This time. 这次。

"What! What are you talking about!" Shinji managed, between whimpering and yelping in pain.  
“什么！你在说什么！”真嗣在痛苦中呜咽着，勉强回应道。

"Go apologize!" Hikari snarled, shoving the pilot forward.  
“去道歉！”光子咆哮着，将驾驶员向前推去。

The Third Child looked disoriented for a moment, shaking his head, trying to take a moment to regain his bearings...  
第三适格者看起来一时有些迷茫，摇了摇头，试图花点时间恢复镇定……

"NOW!" “现在！”

But decided that he didn't want to die at the hands of the Class Rep.  
但他决定不想死在班长手里。

The remaining Stooges watched in amusement as their comrade stumbled through the crowd in the direction that the Second Child had stormed off through. (Not that hard... just follow the bodies). However, their own enjoyment was short lived, as the Ear Twist Of Doom made a second appearance.  
剩下的跟班们幸灾乐祸地看着他们的同伴跌跌撞撞地穿过人群，朝着二子离开的方向追去。（并不难找……只要跟着那些倒下的人就行了）。然而，他们自己的乐趣并没有持续多久，因为“致命耳扭”再次出现了。

"And you two! You're in cleanup duty!"  
"你们两个！负责打扫清洁！"

"AW, SH-" "哎呀，妈呀——"

Hikari whirled on them, eyes full of fire, and both Stooges agreed that she had spent far too much time in Asuka's company. "Want me to make it for a week?"  
光希猛地转向他们，眼中燃烧着怒火，两个跟班一致认为她跟明日香待在一起的时间太长了。“要我让你们扫一个星期吗？”

In unison, Touji and Kensuke sighed deeply, submitting. "... no ma'am."  
同时，冬二和健介深深叹了口气，屈服了。“……是的，女士。”

Asuka kept her held high, not really paying attention to either keeping her umbrella completely over her head nor really thinking about the route she was taking back to the apartment. In her hand, she clenched the second umbrella tightly, her fists shaking.  
明日香高昂着头，并没有真正注意是否将伞完全遮住自己的头，也没有认真考虑回公寓的路线。她紧握着第二把伞，拳头颤抖着。

She wasn't hurt or offended by Shinji's statement... after all, they were friends, in a strange sort of way. You couldn't be in that much contact with someone and _not_ grow somewhat attached to them.  
她并没有因为真嗣的话而感到受伤或冒犯……毕竟，他们以一种奇怪的方式成为了朋友。与某人如此频繁地接触，不可能不产生某种依恋。

Then why had she felt something break, deep inside her as Shinji spoke?  
那么为什么当真嗣说话时，她会感到内心深处有什么东西破碎了呢？

Trying to keep abreast of these thoughts, she continued on her way, barely noticing that her umbrella often drifted to the side, letting an errant raindrop fall on her from time to time.  
她试图跟上这些思绪，继续前行，几乎没有注意到自己的伞常常偏向一边，偶尔会有调皮的雨滴落在她身上。

"Asuka! Asuka!" “明日香！明日香！”

The redhead nearly stopped and turned, but kept walking on, head held high and ignoring the calls of her fellow pilot.  
红发少女几乎停下脚步想要转身，但最终还是继续前行，昂首挺胸，无视了同伴驾驶员的呼喊。

"Asuka! Slow down!" “明日香！慢点！”

As if to spite the boy, the pilot of Unit 02 switched to a brisk pace.  
仿佛是为了故意气那男孩，二号机驾驶员加快了步伐。

But still, Shinji caught up to her, grasping her shoulder with a slight gasp, sucking in breath after breath. His dark hair was matted and flattened by the rain, and his clothes clung to him, soaked through completely.  
但尽管如此，真嗣还是追上了她，微微喘息着抓住她的肩膀，一口接一口地吸气。他的深色头发被雨水打湿，紧贴在头皮上，衣服也完全湿透，紧紧贴在身上。

The Second Child whirled on him, brushing his hand off her with a furious glare. "Don't touch me." She hissed, and then turned again.  
第二适格者猛地转身面对他，愤怒地甩开他的手，"别碰我。"她低声怒斥，随即再次转过身去。

Stung by the rebuttal, Shinji did an unexpected thing-  
被这番反驳刺痛，真嗣做出了一个出乎意料的举动——

And ignored Asuka's tone of voice, grabbing her arm again. "Wait, please Asuka!" he pleaded, gripping her arm tightly.  
无视了明日香的声音，再次抓住她的手臂。“等等，请明日香！”他恳求道，紧紧抓着她的手臂。

"What do you want?" the redhead asked rudely, glaring at him as she turned.  
“你想要什么？”红发女孩粗鲁地问道，转身瞪着他。

"Why are you so angry?" the Third Child questioned, "What did I do?"  
“你为什么这么生气？”第三适格者问道，“我做了什么？”

"Why do you care!" Asuka shot back, shoving Shinji backwards.  
“你干嘛在乎！”明日香回敬道，把真嗣往后一推。

The boy stumbled, and slipped on the ever growing puddle, landing with a loud thump on his bottom. Rubbing it, Shinji groaned. "Ouch..."  
男孩踉跄了一下，滑倒在不断扩大的水坑里，重重地摔了个屁股蹲儿。真嗣揉着屁股，呻吟道：“哎哟……”

Briefly, the Second Child half the irrational impulse to offer her hand to the Third, but squelched it.  
第二适格者短暂地涌起一股不理智的冲动，想向第三适格者伸出手，但还是压了下去。

Without her help, Shinji stood, still groaning and rubbing his sore bottom. "You didn't have to shove so hard," he complained.  
没有她的帮助，真嗣独自站了起来，依旧呻吟着揉搓他疼痛的臀部。“你不必推得那么用力，”他抱怨道。

"Shut up!" the pilot of Unit 02 snarled, and moved to storm off again. This time, Shinji was quick enough to grasp her arm for the third time.  
“闭嘴！”二号机驾驶员咆哮着，再次准备离开。这一次，真嗣反应够快，第三次抓住了她的手臂。

"Please... why are you so angry?" he whispered, bowing his head. "Whatever I did... I'm sorry." He hated it when she got angry with him, but never knew how to solve it.  
“请……你为什么这么生气？”他低声问道，低下头。“无论我做了什么……我很抱歉。”他讨厌她对他生气，但从来不知道如何解决这个问题。

For some reason, this just pissed Asuka off further. "Oh, you're sorry," she drawled, pulling back and glaring with even more vehemence, "Are you? Well, that just makes everything fine and dandy, doesn't it, Third Child!"  
不知为何，这反而让明日香更加恼火。“哦，你道歉了，”她拖长声音，后退一步，眼神更加凌厉，“是吗？那一切就都好了，不是吗，第三适格者！”

"Well, you won't tell me what I did wrong! You never tell me anything!" Shinji shouted, feeling a crack in the emotional dam he had built up over the years. "I never know what to say or think, because you're always yelling at me! I can't even figure out what I did wrong half the time!"  
“你根本不告诉我我哪里做错了！你从来什么都不说！”真嗣大喊，感到多年来建立的情感堤坝出现了一道裂缝。“我永远不知道该说什么或想什么，因为你总是对我大吼大叫！我甚至有一半的时间都搞不清楚自己哪里做错了！”

Somehow, this forced Asuka to pause and reflect on what the Third said. Opening up was not in her policy, not even to Kaji. And yet... and yet there was always one part of her that wanted to say these things, let someone in, and finally take away the loneliness.  
不知怎么的，这让明日香不得不停下来反思第三适格者的话。敞开心扉不是她的原则，甚至对加持也不例外。然而……然而总有一部分的她想要说出这些话，让某人进入她的世界，最终驱散那份孤独。

"You can't understand me!" Asuka finally managed to scoff, "You're nothing but a weak little boy."  
"你根本不懂我！" 绫波终于嗤之以鼻，"你不过是个软弱的小男孩罢了。"

"Damn it Asuka, I'm trying to! If you'd just let me in..." Shinji's second sentence lost its vehemence, and became softer, quieter, but that soft force destroyed any retort the redhead had coming.  
"该死的绫波，我正努力理解你！如果你能让我靠近一点..." 真嗣的第二句话失去了原有的激烈，变得柔和、低沉，但那柔和的力量摧毁了红发少女即将出口的任何反驳。

The second umbrella in her hand trembled. The Second Child glanced down at it. Wasn't that what she really wanted? To take some of that invincibility Shinji projected in battle, and take comfort in it?  
她手中的第二把伞微微颤抖。二号适格者低头看向它。这不正是她真正想要的吗？在战斗中汲取真嗣所展现的那种无敌气势，并从中获得安慰？

Why had she brought that second umbrella, if not for him?  
如果不是为了他，她为何要带上那第二把伞？

They were quiet for a long time, neither able to say anything further. If they had been older, wiser, or less damaged by the past, they may have been able to go another step.  
他们沉默了许久，谁也无法再说些什么。如果他们更年长、更睿智，或者未曾被过去所伤，或许还能再进一步。

But for now, something had changed, and that was enough.  
但眼下，有些事情已经改变，这就足够了。

"You're soaked." Asuka pointed out softly, smiling.  
"你全身都湿透了。" 明日香轻声指出，微笑着。

Shinji's breath caught in his throat, and he found his mouth dry. He was reminded that Asuka was very beautiful. It was even better than her face as she slept that night before the Seventh Angel. The smile was soft and warm and just for him, and he felt that as long as he could see that smile, he was capable of defeating a hundred Angels.  
真嗣的呼吸卡在了喉咙里，他感到口干舌燥。他意识到明日香非常美丽。甚至比那晚在第七使徒来袭前她熟睡时的面容还要动人。她的笑容温柔而温暖，只为他一人绽放，他觉得只要能看到那个笑容，他就有能力击败一百个使徒。

"Hello? Earth to Shinji?" the redhead smirked slightly, waving her hand in front of his face, jolting him back to reality.  
"喂？真嗣，回神啦？" 红发少女微微扬起嘴角，挥手在他眼前晃动，将他拉回现实。

Glancing at himself, Shinji nodded, sighing as more rain poured down on him. However, he blinked in surprise as an object was lightly shoved into his gut.  
瞥了一眼镜中的自己，真嗣点点头，叹息着更多的雨水倾泻在他身上。然而，当一个物体轻轻推入他的腹部时，他惊讶地眨了眨眼。

"Here." The redhead said quietly, a slight blush on her face, and then turned, and walked away.  
“给。”红发女孩轻声说道，脸上泛起一丝红晕，然后转身，走开了。

Blinking, Shinji just held on to the umbrella for a moment, staring at it. _What..._  
真嗣眨了眨眼，只是握着那把伞，盯着它看了一会儿。什么……

"Hey! Idiot! Are you just going to stand there or what?" Asuka shouted, glancing back at him coyly over her shoulder.  
“嘿！傻瓜！你打算就站在那儿还是怎样？”明日香喊道，狡黠地回头瞥了他一眼。

Nodding, the boy ran after her, umbrella raised, a smile on his face.  
男孩点点头，举着伞追了上去，脸上挂着微笑。

Maybe this rain wasn't so bad after all.  
也许这场雨并没有那么糟糕。

Author's Remarks 作者的话

I'm going soft... I actually wrote a WAFF fic... then again, I'm up at four in morning, hyped up on ice cream, soda, and chicken. I suppose anything can happen with that volatile mix. I always seem to write WAFF in the wee hours of insanity. The umbrella scenario, while typically cliche, is inspired by an Evangelion Doujinshi. I took care to keep as much character integrity as I could, but... I am up at an absurdly early hour. Am not at my best.  
我变得软弱了...我居然写了一篇温馨文...不过话说回来，我在凌晨四点起床，兴奋地吃着冰淇淋、喝着汽水和炸鸡。我想在这种兴奋的状态下，什么事都可能发生。我总是在这种疯狂的凌晨时分写温馨文。那个雨伞的情景，虽然通常很老套，但灵感来自一部《新世纪福音战士》的同人志。我尽力保持了尽可能多的角色完整性，但是...我在一个荒谬的早班时间。不是我的最佳状态。

Alright, enough of my pointless rambling. Complaints, comments, etcetera, should go in a review.  
好了，我的无意义唠叨就到此为止。如果有任何抱怨、评论等等，请在评论中提出。

### Comment
[bannonluke](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/12290/bannonluke): I think that you had Asuka's characterisation done very well. I also found parts such as, "Touji and Kensuke, as they were friends with Shinji, did what most other males did to help cheer their friends up. Teased them mercilessly." very witty and amusing. One of the best one shot romances I have read in a long time. Keep up the good work  
我认为你对明日香的刻画做得非常好。我还发现一些部分，比如，“由于和真嗣是朋友，东治和健介像大多数其他男性一样，为了帮助朋友振作起来，无情地调侃他们。”非常机智且有趣。这是我很久以来读过的最好的短篇爱情故事之一。继续保持优秀的工作。

[Story Weaver1](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/364562/Story-Weaver1): Very cute. You're good at WAFF. I especially liked Hikari and the ear twist of doom!  
非常可爱。你很擅长写温馨情节。我特别喜欢光和那个致命的耳朵扭动！

[Incognito girl](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/675427/Incognito-girl): Hey there! I loved your fic! I think you did a pretty good job keeping them in character. well...at least as much as you can with it being a WAFF. but yeah, if you're ever up during the "wee hours" again PLEASE maybe write a sequel_ haha I think it could be great! Pleased continue to write.  
嘿！我超喜欢你的同人文！我觉得你把角色保持得很好。嗯...至少在 WAFF（温馨甜蜜文）里能做到这样。不过，如果你在“深夜时分”再有灵感，请务必写个续集哈哈，我觉得会很棒的！期待你继续创作。

[Nicholas Bledsoe](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/459147/Nicholas-Bledsoe): Great story. I really don't see the umbrella bit as being cliche (plan to use an umbrella bit myself in the future). The use of rain, or any use of a storm, is a classic way to establish atmosphere in a story, and I think it worked wonderfully in this case.  
精彩的故事。我真的不觉得用伞的部分是陈词滥调（我自己也打算将来用这个点子）。使用雨，或者任何风暴的元素，是建立故事氛围的经典方式，我认为在这部作品中运用得非常出色。  
Speaking of storms, Hikari was great. I always love how everyone fears/respects the class rep. If you want to survive, you would be wise to stay out of her path. Asuka may be the Devil, but Hikari is a force of nature.  
说到风暴，光表现得很好。我总是喜欢大家既害怕又尊敬班长的情节。如果你想生存下去，明智的做法是避开她的道路。明日香可能是魔鬼，但光是大自然的力量。

[Linkin-Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/578289/Linkin-Phoenix):
Three things, 三件事，  
  
One: What's a WAFF fic?  
第一：什么是 WAFF 文？  
  
Two: what's a Doujinshi? (Sorry I know very, very few Japanese words, only the ones I've picked up from reading Fan Fiction and watching Anime)  
第二章：什么是同人志？（抱歉，我知道的日语词汇非常少，只有从阅读同人文和观看动漫中学到的那些）  
  
Three: Hikari's words "Go, Apologise" were the exact same words she speakings in 'Both of You, Dance like you want to win'  
第三章：光说的“去，道歉”正是她在‘你们俩，跳舞就像要赢一样’中说的那句话  
  
That last part with Shinji and Asuka in the rain when they were talking rung a bell with part of Shinji's mind trip during EoE with the "I want to try and help you" lines, but then in the next scene he does attempt to strangle her, so at least we all got to live vicariously through Shinji for a moment... back to the matter at hand,  
最后那部分，真嗣和明日香在雨中交谈的场景，让我想起了 EoE 中真嗣的内心挣扎，特别是那句“我想试着帮助你”的台词，但紧接着的下一幕他确实试图掐死她，所以至少我们都有片刻通过真嗣体验了一把……回到正题，  
  
::Appludes Hikari:: That was funny, but very accurate, she definately played it well,  
::为光鼓掌:: 那很有趣，但也十分准确，她的确演得很好，  
  
Well I'm done, later,  
好了，我结束了，再见，  
  
Phoenix  凤凰
