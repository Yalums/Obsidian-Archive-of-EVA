"You did what?!" “你做了什么？！”

I tried to keep the anger out of my voice, I really tried. But after a long day at a school and a sync test that over ran by an hour my patience was at an all time low.
我尽力不让声音中流露出愤怒，真的尽力了。但在学校度过漫长的一天，加上同步测试超时一小时，我的耐心已降至历史最低点。

Shinji's day is the same as yours Asuka, he's probably just as tired as you are, A small voice in the back of my mind went.
真嗣的一天和你一样，明日香，他可能也和你一样疲惫，我脑海深处有个小小的声音说道。

I did my best to ignore it. As he stood there in that silly apron of his surrounded by the smoky haze in the kitchen, I really didn't have any sympathy. He had just burnt our dinner after all. Dammit, I was really hungry too! I wasn't going to say that to him of course. Telling Shinji I needed him for something? No. It would go to his head and give him strange ideas.
我尽量不去理会它。当他站在厨房里，那傻乎乎的围裙环绕着他，四周烟雾缭绕，我真的没有丝毫同情。毕竟，他刚刚烧糊了我们的晚餐。该死，我也真的很饿！当然，我不会告诉他这些。让真嗣知道我需要他？不，那只会让他自以为是，产生奇怪的想法。

I last ate lunch at school and that was six hours ago. I was really looking forward to something to clear the taste of LCL out of my mouth. Even rinsing your mouth with water only did so much. Plus, a young lady like me has to be well fed after all! I won't accept- no, I don't deserve anything less!
我上次在学校吃午餐已经是六小时前的事了。我真的很期待能吃点什么来清除嘴里 LCL 的味道。即便用水漱口也只能缓解一时。再说了，像我这样的年轻女士，总得吃饱才行！我不会接受——不，我配得上更好的！

Hands on hips, feet tapping I waited for his explanation. This should be interesting...
双手叉腰，脚尖轻敲地面，我等着他的解释。这应该挺有意思的……

With his head down, he did that nervous little shuffle of his when had something to say but was just working up the courage to say it. You wouldn't think such a timid boy could be the pilot of something like an Eva or even anywhere near my level yet here he was. Dish towel in one hand and spatula in the other like he was getting ready to battle some culinary monstrosity spawned by way of Misato's latest cooking attempt.
他低着头，紧张地小步挪动，似乎有话要说却又鼓不起勇气。你不会想到这样一个胆小的男孩竟能成为 Eva 的驾驶员，甚至接近我的水平，但他确实就在这里。一手拿着抹布，一手握着锅铲，仿佛准备迎战由美里最新烹饪尝试所诞生的厨艺怪物。

"Well?" I said, louder than I wanted, part trying to get him to spit it out whilst also trying to cover the sound of my growling stomach.
“怎么样？”我提高了音量，比我想的还要大声，一方面是想让他快点说出来，另一方面也是为了掩盖我肚子咕噜咕噜的声音。

"... erm, w-well like I said, I was trying... something n-new and I must have gotten the t-timing wrong and then it just kinda-"
“...呃，就、就像我说的，我在尝试...一些新东西，我一定是搞错了时间，然后就...”

New? I wonder what he was making? No, it doesn't matter now. It's done.
新东西？不知道他在做什么？算了，现在不重要了。已经结束了。

He gestured lamely towards a baking tray of charred mush. Waiting a few seconds more and the silence confirmed that was all the explanation I was going to get. 'Wrong' he says, as if it was a mathematical equation he'd gotten incorrect and not the remains of tonight's dinner. The invincible Shinji Ikari, Third Child, destroyer of Angels and now, failure in the kitchen. Not that I could do any better but it wasn't my place to.
他无力地指向一盘烤得焦黑的糊状物。再等了几秒，沉默证实了这就是我能得到的全部解释。'错了'，他说道，仿佛这是一道他解错的数学题，而非今晚晚餐的残骸。无敌的碇真嗣，第三适格者，天使的毁灭者，如今却在厨房里遭遇失败。并非我能做得更好，只是这不是我的职责所在。

It's what Shinji was for after all.
毕竟，这就是碇真嗣的用武之地。

A quick once over around me confirmed some of his story, various ingredients and packaging arrayed around the kitchen top and recipe book held ajar by a dinner plate. This was something different for Shinji. Normally he isn't so messy in his domestic chores. And also doesn't take so long.
我迅速环顾四周，确认了他的部分说法，厨房台面上散落着各种食材和包装，食谱书被一个餐盘撑开。这对碇真嗣来说是件新鲜事。通常他在家务活中不会这么凌乱。而且也不会花这么长时间。

He'd wanted to go to grocery store to 'grab a few things' after our sync tests but I put a stop to that. If the idiot wanted to play housewife then he could do so in his own time. I was looking forward to a nice warm bath after such a long day and nothing was going to delay me. So we came straight home; me to the bathroom, him to the kitchen.
他本想在同步测试后去杂货店'随便买点东西'，但我阻止了他。如果那傻瓜想扮演家庭主妇，那就让他自己找时间去吧。经过漫长的一天，我期待着好好泡个热水澡，没有什么能让我耽搁。所以我们直接回家了；我去了浴室，他去了厨房。

I wasn't expecting an apartment full of smoke when I finished however. Coughing and cursing at the smell that was no doubt going to stick all over my clean form and fresh clothes, I had found Shinji in the kitchen. His usual sense of ease around the stove having vanished and replaced with severe distress. He'd nearly jumped through the ceiling when he saw me.
然而，当我洗完澡时，我没想到会看到满屋子的烟。我一边咳嗽一边咒骂着那股无疑会粘在我干净的身体和刚换的衣服上的气味，我在厨房找到了真嗣。他平时在炉子前的轻松感消失了，取而代之的是严重的焦虑。他看到我时差点跳上天花板。

Did I mention I was hungry?
我提到过我饿了吗？

I am bored of the rice and fish we eat all the time but did he have to choose today to be adventurous? Of course Shinji has to be so different, so special. A normal dinner like normal people just wouldn't do.
我对总是吃米饭和鱼感到厌烦，但他非得选在今天冒险吗？当然，真嗣总是要与众不同，如此特别。像普通人那样吃顿普通的晚餐就是不行。

Coming back to the present, my eyes settled on the boy once again.
回到现实中，我的目光再次落在了那个男孩身上。

"Well, that's just great isn't it, Third Child? Now what do you expect us to eat?" Letting out an annoyed breath and jabbing him in the chest with my finger. That always seemed to get a response out of him.
“好吧，这真是太棒了，不是吗，第三适格者？现在你指望我们吃什么？”我叹了口气，不耐烦地用手指戳了戳他的胸口。这招似乎总能引起他的反应。

He mumbled something I didn't quite hear, still not lifting his head. I could feel that familiar tick of annoyance again at this display. Seriously, what is wrong with him? I leaned forward, straining to hear his words.
他咕哝了些什么我没太听清，头依旧没抬起来。我再次感受到了那种熟悉的恼怒感，真是的，他到底怎么了？我向前倾身，努力去听他的话。

"Can you repeat that Shinji?" My voice channelling Misato in her moments as our commanding officer.
“你能再说一遍吗，真嗣？”我的声音模仿着美里在我们指挥官时刻的样子。

"... I er, used up all the ingredients. We'll have to order take-out-"
“……我，呃，用完了所有食材。我们得点外卖了……”

This new piece of information was absorbed in the same manner I was breathing in the hazy apartment air. With abject disgust. Before I knew it, I had put myself right in front of him and was once again angrily jabbing my palm into his scrawny chest.
这条新信息被我以同样的方式吸收，就像我在那烟雾缭绕的公寓里呼吸空气一样。带着极端的厌恶。在我意识到之前，我已经站在他面前，再次愤怒地用手指戳着他瘦弱的胸膛。

"And just how long-" "那到底要多久——"

jab

"-is that going to take-"
"——才能完成——"

jab

"Stop." "停下。"

"-I've already been waiting for"
"-我已经等了很久了-"

jab

"Asuka, stop-" "明日香，停下-"

"-ages and now you want-"
"-年纪大了，现在你却要-"

jab

"-me to wait even longer! Are you serious-"
"-我等更久！你是认真的吗-"

"I SAID STOP IT!" "我叫你停下！"

The words exploded out of Shinji as his head snapped up, brow furrowed and eyes raised with a glint of... something. My own eyes widened in surprise and I'm pretty sure my mouth was hanging open too. Shock stopped whatever words I was going to say, my mind going blank as I stared at the now trembling boy.
话语如爆炸般从真嗣口中迸发，他的头猛地抬起，眉头紧锁，眼中闪烁着...某种光芒。我的眼睛因惊讶而睁大，我敢肯定我的嘴巴也张开了。震惊让我原本要说的话戛然而止，我的思绪一片空白，盯着眼前颤抖的男孩。

And Shinji just carried on.
而真嗣就这样继续着。

"I tried ok? Isn't that what you want? I tried! I really wanted to make this for-"
“我试过了，好吗？这不是你想要的吗？我试了！我真的想为这个做点什么——”

He stopped, blinking as if realising where he was.
他停了下来，眨了眨眼，仿佛意识到自己身在何处。

And who he was talking to.
以及他在和谁说话。

His mouth pressed into a thin line, face flushed, the hands at his sides now empty and balled into fists. As he took a step back, I realised how much closer we had been standing, He continued, this time in a much quieter voice though still tinged with an edge.
他的嘴角紧抿成一条细线，脸颊泛红，原本垂在身侧的双手此刻空空如也，紧握成拳。当他后退一步时，我才意识到我们之前站得有多近。他继续说道，这次声音低了许多，但仍带着一丝锋芒。

"But it never matters, does it Asuka? No matter what I do, you will never- you never care."
"但这对明日香来说从来都不重要，不是吗？无论我做什么，你永远不会——你从不关心。"

His voice now steadily rising again and I resolved to put him in his place. How dare he?! Who does he think he is speaking to me like that? Crossing my arms, I stamped one foot forward, daring him to come closer and ready to give him a piece of my mind.
他的声音再次逐渐升高，我决心让他明白自己的位置。他怎么敢？！他以为自己在对谁说话？我交叉双臂，向前跺了一脚，挑衅他靠近，准备好好教训他一顿。

"Why should I-" "我为什么要——"

And he cut right through me, as if I had never spoken.
他就这样直截了当地刺穿了我，仿佛我从未开口。

"Do you think I care?!"
"你以为我在乎吗？！"

He asked with a shout. And for the second time, stopped me in my tracks. Past the anger, his words struck deep within me. For once, no obvious reply came to me. No sarcastic remark. Not even one of my usual insults for the idiot.
他大声质问。这已经是第二次，让我哑口无言。愤怒之外，他的话深深触动了我。这一次，我竟无言以对。没有讽刺的回应，连平日里对那蠢货的惯常嘲讽也说不出口。

Since when was that such an awkward question? Does that mean he doesn't...? Not even my own thoughts wanting to finish question. I blinked, as if the action would somehow buy some time but Shinji was already moving. Now face to face once again and I opened my mouth to say... I don't know, something. But his next words, whispered in the now quiet apartment silenced me.
从什么时候起，这个问题变得如此尴尬了？这是否意味着他并不……？甚至我自己的思绪都想要完成这个问题。我眨了眨眼，仿佛这个动作能为我争取一些时间，但真嗣已经动了。再次面对面，我张开嘴想说……我不知道，说些什么。但他在此刻安静的公寓里低声说出的下一句话，让我沉默了。

"... well, I do." “……嗯，我是。”

I blinked again, I'm sure I had a stupid expression on my face at this point. Still processing the entire thing. Shinji didn't wait for a reply, shoving past me and out the door. But not before I caught one last sight as he went past.
我又眨了眨眼，我确信此时我的脸上一定是一副愚蠢的表情。我仍在处理这一切。真嗣没有等我回答，从我身边挤过，走出了门。但在他经过时，我最后瞥了他一眼。

Of tears shimmering in his eyes.
他眼中闪烁的泪光。

[=========]

I don't know how long I stood there for, as the adrenaline coursed its way through my body. I could feel my heartbeat, fast and loud, my face very warm and let out a breath I didn't know I had been holding.
我不知道自己在那里站了多久，肾上腺素在我体内奔涌。我能感觉到心跳急促而响亮，脸颊异常温暖，吐出了一口不知何时屏住的气。

My own hands, curled into fists, slowly relaxed but not before-
我自己的双手，紧握成拳，缓缓放松，但在那之前——

"Argh! That idiot! Who the hell does he think he is?!"
“啊！那个白痴！他以为自己是谁啊？！”

It felt nice to let it out but I soon felt foolish with the realisation that I was alone and was shouting at an empty apartment. It was in that moment that PenPen made an appearance, grabbed a beer and with a sidelong look that somehow showed both boredom and pity he quickly waddled back into his cooler.
发泄出来感觉很好，但很快我就意识到自己一个人对着空荡荡的公寓大喊大叫，感到很愚蠢。就在那时，PenPen 出现了，抓起一瓶啤酒，用一种既无聊又带着怜悯的侧目看了我一眼，然后迅速摇摇摆摆地回到了他的冷却器里。

How does a penguin act so human?
企鹅怎么会表现得如此人性化？

I suddenly felt very stupid. Letting out a grunt of frustration I kicked the nearest object-
我突然觉得自己很蠢。发出一声沮丧的咕哝，我踢了最近的一个物体——

"Owww!" “哎哟！”

The table which had been the target of my anger, said nothing. That's what I get for not thinking. Damn you Shinji! I silently cursed, my thoughts dragging themselves back to the boy. And what he had just said.
那张曾是我愤怒目标的桌子，一言不发。这就是我不经思考的后果。该死的真嗣！我默默咒骂，思绪不由自主地回到了那个男孩身上。以及他刚刚说的话。

"...well, I do." “……好吧，我确实。”

That idiot, saying something like that. What do I say to that? And more importantly... why I do care?
那个白痴，说出那样的话。我该怎么回应呢？更重要的是……我为什么会在意？

I side lined the thought and decided to concentrate on the here and now. My eyes scanning the kitchen with the remains of Shinji's untidy attempt at... something, I realised how heavy the silence that had settled was. Along with the smoke it gave the place a very eerie atmosphere. Normally when I'm in here there's always something going on, whether it's the sound of Shinji cooking or Misato drinking the day away. Never just me. And in that moment, though you'll never hear me say it out loud, I felt very alone.
我暂时搁置了这个念头，决定专注于当下。我的目光扫过厨房，那里还残留着真嗣尝试做某事的凌乱痕迹，我意识到笼罩在这里的寂静有多沉重。伴随着烟雾，这个地方弥漫着一种诡异的氛围。通常当我在这里时，总会有点什么动静，无论是真嗣做饭的声音还是美里整日饮酒的声响。从未只有我一个人。而在那一刻，尽管你永远不会听到我大声说出来，我感到非常孤单。

Looking at the clock I realised Misato would be home soon, she would no doubt be expecting the table to be ready... and Shinji home. That is one conversation I am not looking forward to. Of course she'd be worrying about her little Shinji-kun, mentally rolling my eyes. I had to do something. My head turned in the direction Shinji had left, towards the darkened hallway leading to the front door.
看着时钟，我意识到美里很快就会回家，她无疑会期待着餐桌已经准备好……还有真嗣也在家。那场对话是我所不期待的。当然，她会担心她的小真嗣君，我心里翻了个白眼。我必须做点什么。我的头转向真嗣离开的方向，朝着通往前门的昏暗走廊。

Narrowing my eyes, I settled on a course of action. Never let it be said that Asuka Langley Sohryu runs away from her problems! I'll find him and drag him back to finish what he started. How he had gotten so far in life I will never know but I'll be damned if I let him think he can just do whatever he wants.
我眯起眼睛，决定采取行动。绝不能让任何人说，惣流·明日香·兰格雷会逃避问题！我要找到他，把他拖回来完成他开始的事情。他究竟是如何走到这一步的，我永远不会知道，但如果让他以为可以为所欲为，那我可就太没用了。

And say whatever he wants. I'll find out what he meant if it's the last thing I do. So here I am, about to run across god knows where to find him. It's not everyday a pretty girl runs after the guy, you know! Does Shinji realise how lucky he is?
而且想说啥就说啥。如果这是我做的最后一件事，我也要弄清楚他的意思。所以，我即将跑遍上帝才知道的地方去找他。你知道的，漂亮女孩追着男生跑可不是每天都有的事！真嗣意识到自己有多幸运吗？

My stomach growled in response. Ugh so hungry.
我的肚子咕咕叫了起来。呃，好饿。

But first, a trip to Hikari's.
但首先，得去光的家。

[=========]

A quick change of clothes, a frantic attempt at drying my still damp hair and a short trek across the city and I had found myself at Hikari's house.
匆匆换了衣服，急忙试图弄干仍湿漉漉的头发，穿过城市的一段短途跋涉后，我发现自己来到了光的家里。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

She didn't look surprised at seeing me though I put that down to the fact that we spent time at each other's places often. Placing the empty bowl of miso soup down next to the first, I sat crossed legged in Hikari's bedroom. My hunger somewhat satiated, I had explained the days events to her. She calmly took in my explanation of what had happened. Unlike, Misato or Shinji, she never interrupted or told me to quieten down.
尽管我们经常在彼此的地方度过时光，她看到我时并没有显得惊讶。我把这归因于这个事实。我把空着的味噌汤碗放在第一个旁边，盘腿坐在光的小卧室里。我的饥饿感有所缓解，我向她解释了那天的事件。她平静地接受了我的解释，发生了什么。与美里或真嗣不同，她从未打断我或让我安静下来。

She's such a good listener.
她真是个好听众。

"And that's when he shouted at you and left?" She asked quietly.
“然后他就对你大喊大叫然后离开了？”她轻声问道。

I kept the fact that I had made the boy run out in tears to myself, not sure if I would be ready for Hikari's reaction to that piece of the telling.
我隐瞒了自己让那男孩泪奔的事实，不确定光对此会有何反应。

"That's right! It was just so... so..."
“没错！真是太...太...”

I was lost for words, not knowing how to describe the actions of the Third Child. Now that I had put some time and distance between myself and our argument, I could think a bit more clearly. I know Shinji, he does have his moments when he's not a complete pushover, when he shows that backbone of his. When we were in that kitchen, he had the same look in his eyes, that... fire that I'd only ever seen before when he was piloting his Eva.
我一时语塞，不知如何形容第三适格者的行为。现在，我与那场争执已有些时日和距离，思路清晰了许多。我了解真嗣，他有时并不完全是个软弱的人，他会展现出自己的骨气。在厨房里，他的眼神和那时一样，那种...我只在驾驶 Eva 时见过的火焰。

I just never expected it to be directed at me. He surprised me. One hand idly pulling at the collar of my top to keep the warmth at bay, I was lost in my own thoughts. It was just so...
我从未料到这会是对着我来的。他让我感到意外。一只手漫不经心地拉扯着我的上衣领口，以抵御寒意，我陷入了自己的思绪中。这一切只是如此……

I was thankful when Hikari interjected before I could finish the thought and my earlier words.
当光在我能完成那个念头和我之前的话语之前打断时，我感到庆幸。

"Manly?" A small smile across her face, cheeks tinged pink. Are those stars in her eyes?
男子气概？她脸上带着一丝微笑，脸颊微微泛红。她的眼睛里闪烁着星星吗？

Ok, maybe not thankful. 好吧，也许不是感激。

"Yes... W-wait, n-no! No! Hikari!" She was lucky there were no pillows in arms reach otherwise she'd have gotten the full Sohryu wrath! Settling with glaring at my friend instead, I turned my head away with a Hmph!, letting her know exactly what I thought of her words.
“是……等、等等，不！不！光！”她很幸运，手边没有枕头，否则她就会尝到全套的苏里高怒火！我只好瞪着我的朋友，转过头去哼了一声，让她清楚地知道我对她的话有多不以为然。

Doing badly at stifling a giggle, Hikari continued.
光勉强忍住笑，继续说道。

"Asuka... you know he was cooking for you, right?"
"明日香...你知道他是在为你做饭，对吧？"

I didn't catch on, unsure where she was going with this.
我不明白她的用意，不确定她想表达什么。

"Well yeah, who else would he cook for?" Barely stopping myself from rolling my eyes at her. She could be so dense sometimes.
"嗯，当然了，他还能为谁做饭呢？"" 我差点没忍住对她翻白眼。她有时候真是迟钝得可以。

"No, Asuka... he was cooking for you. He told you what he was making right?"
"不，明日香...他是为你做饭的。他告诉你他在做什么，对吧？"

No... because I was too busy arguing with him for ruining my dinner. I didn't say anything but Hikari must've seen the look on my face and switched to 'class rep' mode, her eyebrows knitting together slightly. She stared at me for a moment, as if deciding her words before coming to a decision with a swift nod.
不...因为我当时正忙着和他争论他把我的晚餐搞砸了。我什么也没说，但光一定是从我的表情中看出来了，她切换到了'班长'模式，眉头微微皱起。她盯着我看了一会儿，似乎在斟酌措辞，然后迅速点头做出了决定。

"Shinji... came to me the other day, asking about German cuisine. I think he was trying to find out your favourite foods. I think he wanted to make something from your home. I couldn't really help him-"
"真嗣...前几天来找我，询问德国料理的事。我想他是想找出你最喜欢的食物。我想他是想做些来自你家乡的东西。我没能帮上太多忙-"

My mind was already racing ahead of her words, pieces started to fall into place as I recalled the last few hours. The cookbook, the messy kitchen, the look of panic on his face. Shinji Ikari, the boy who couldn't even string a coherent sentence together in my presence, wanted to cook something... for me?
我的思绪早已在她的话语之前飞速运转，回忆起过去几个小时的片段开始逐渐拼凑起来。那本食谱，凌乱的厨房，他脸上惊慌失措的表情。碇真嗣，那个在我面前连一句连贯的话都说不出来的男孩，竟然想为我做点什么...做饭？

And a non-Japanese dish too!
而且还是一道非日本料理！

You idiot. The thought held none of it's usual contempt, and I immediately wondered who it was directed at. Shinji was, for once, not the most obvious candidate. His words echoed in my mind.
你这个傻瓜。这个念头并没有带着往常的轻蔑，我立刻好奇这是针对谁的。这一次，碇真嗣并不是最显而易见的目标。他的话在我脑海中回响。

"I tried ok? Isn't that what you want? I tried! I really wanted to make this for-"
"我试过了，行吗？这不是你想要的吗？我试了！我真的想为这个做——"

For me. 为我。

Shinji wanted to cook something for me alone, that he knew I would appreciate?
真嗣想为我一个人做点什么，他知道我会欣赏的？

Yes.

He had gone through the effort even if it ended in failure. It was... nice. No, it wasn't just nice. It was thoughtful. He had even asked Hikari, he had prepared and then done his best in his own, quiet way.
他即便最终失败了，也付出了努力。这...很美好。不，不仅仅是美好。这是体贴。他甚至还询问了光，他准备充分，然后以自己安静的方式尽了全力。

I could see a nice gesture for what it was. Never let it be said that Asuka Langley Sohryu is ungrateful!
我能看出这是一个美好的举动。别让人说惣流·明日香·兰格雷不知感恩！

"Asuka? Hello, Asuka?" Hikari's words snapped me out of my thoughts and I refocused my attention back on the girl. Her face softened into a sad smile.
“明日香？你好，明日香？”光的话将我拉回现实，我重新将注意力集中在她身上。她的脸上露出了悲伤的微笑。

"You know... I think you should go and find him-" She's right. I didn't really have anywhere else to go and after what he had done, I needed to talk to him, without any further words I got up, ready to leave.
"你知道... 我觉得你应该去找他——" 她说得对。我确实无处可去，而且在他做了那些事后，我需要和他谈谈，不再多言，我起身准备离开。

"-and apologise." "——并道歉。"

My head snapped back around to face her, not even trying to hide my reddening cheeks. Words died on my lips as I was faced with the full Hikari glare and I shared some understanding of what the jock went through on a daily basis. Suppressing a shudder at having something in common with that ape, I knew it was no use in arguing with Hikari when she's like this.
我的头猛地转回面对她，丝毫不掩饰我涨红的脸颊。面对着 Hikari 那全然的瞪视，我的话哽在喉咙里，我多少理解了那个运动员每天经历的感受。想到自己竟与那家伙有相似之处，我不禁打了个寒颤，我知道当 Hikari 这样时，与她争论是无济于事的。

"Asuka... doesn't he do a lot of work for you and Miss Katsuragi?" Cutting me off before I could get in a word.
"明日香...他不是为你和葛城小姐做了很多工作吗？" 在我能插话之前就打断了我。

"Well, yeah sur-" "嗯，是啊，当然-"

"And doesn't he do your laundry and cooking everyday?"
"而且他不是每天都帮你们洗衣服和做饭吗？"

"Hikari-" "光-

"And he makes your school lunches too? I recall you really liked that tonkatsu bento he made yesterday-"
"他连你的学校午餐也做吗？我记得你昨天特别喜欢他做的那个炸猪排便当-

"... Ok, fine, you win Hikari." I'll give in, this time. It had been a really nice lunch, the memory making my mouth water slightly.
"...好吧，光，你赢了。这次我就让步吧。那顿午餐真的很美味，回忆起来都让我有点流口水了。

I decided to leave before I faced another lecture from the girl. Sharing a smile as I left her house, Hikari gave one final, wordless look before I went on my way. It was a look that said I would share all the details with her tomorrow. Details! As if there'd be anything to say. I blame all those sappy dramas she watches.
我决定在再次面对那女孩的说教之前离开。离开她家时，我与光分享了一个微笑，她在我离开前投来最后一瞥，无声地表达着明天我会向她详细讲述一切。细节！好像有什么可说的似的。我怪她看的那些煽情剧。

Now alone and on my way back to the apartment, I let out a sigh, holding my jacket close to myself to ward off the slightly cooler evening air. It was still early evening and I kept a steady pace, weaving in between the commuter crowds and shoppers in my journey through central Tokyo-3. I kept my eyes focused ahead of me, the usual attractions and lights around me not holding my attention. I can't say I was in a rush to get back to the apartment.
现在独自一人走在回公寓的路上，我叹了口气，紧紧裹住外套抵御稍凉的晚风。时间尚早，我保持着稳定的步伐，穿梭在东京-3 市中心的人群和购物者之间。我的目光始终直视前方，周围的常规景致和灯光并未吸引我的注意。我不能说我急于回到公寓。

Not if Shinji wasn't there. Should I try and find him? Where could he be? What do I say?
如果真嗣不在的话。我应该去找他吗？他会在哪里？我该说什么？

Mentally checking off places he may have gone, I came to the sudden realisation that I really didn't know him as well as I thought.
在脑海中逐一排除他可能去的地方，我突然意识到，我其实并没有自己想象中那么了解他。

None of the places I came up with seemed likely or plausible destinations for the boy. School? Closed. Nerv? No. His two stooge friends? Maybe, but it would be a cold day in hell before I turned to them for help. With every step closer to the apartment, I slowly ran out of options until I found myself within the complex itself and facing the door to the apartment. Misato would be home by now. At best, she'd be in a drunken stupor and I could slip past. At worst...
我想出的那些地方似乎都不太可能是他的目的地。学校？已经关门了。NERV？不可能。他那两个跟班朋友？或许，但除非天寒地冻，否则我绝不会向他们求助。每靠近公寓一步，我的选择就减少一分，直到我发现自己已经站在公寓楼内，面对着公寓的门。美里现在应该已经回家了。最好的情况是她喝得烂醉如泥，我可以悄悄溜过去。最坏的情况……

I hesitated as I braced myself for what was to come. I'm not afraid. I just knew that my hope of a quiet, relaxing night would be gone as soon as Misato saw me. After all, coming home to a mess of a kitchen, no food and neither Shinji or myself present would not put her in a good mood. Certainly would not help those wrinkles around her eyes. And I'm sure she's gained a grey hair or two since me and Shinji started living with her. Hah!
我犹豫着，为自己即将面对的情况做好准备。我并不害怕。我只是知道，一旦美里看到我，我那安静放松的夜晚希望就会破灭。毕竟，回到家看到厨房一团糟，没有食物，我和真嗣都不在，这绝不会让她心情好起来。当然，这也不会有助于她眼角的皱纹。而且我敢肯定，自从我和真嗣开始和她一起生活以来，她一定多了几根白发。哈哈！

Shaking my head and reminding myself who it was who faced Angels everyday in her Eva, I opened the door, head held high and walked through with a smile. Let's get this over with. What's the worst that could happen?
我摇了摇头，提醒自己她可是每天都在 Eva 里与天使对抗的人，于是我昂首推开门，面带微笑地走了进去。让我们尽快结束这一切吧。最坏又能怎样呢？

The scene that greeted me however wasn't one that I had been expecting.
然而，映入眼帘的景象却是我未曾预料到的。

[=========]

There was no Misato. There was Shinji.
没有美里。只有真嗣。

He had his back to me and apron clad once more. Cleaning the kitchen with practised efficiency, picking up the bits and pieces around him. Tidying it up, wiping a cloth here, tossing something into the trash there. He hadn't yet noticed me and I hesitated. Now what? I still wasn't sure what I was going to say to him, remembering what Hikari had said but unsure how to proceed.
他背对着我，再次系上了围裙。熟练而高效地清理着厨房，捡起周围的零碎物品。整理着，这里擦一擦，那里扔点东西进垃圾桶。他还没注意到我，我犹豫了。现在怎么办？我仍然不确定要对他说什么，记着光里的话，但不知如何进行。

Dealing with a drunk or angry Misato? Easy.
对付醉酒或愤怒的美里？简单。

Apologising to Shinji? After nearly a year of having known him I still hadn't figured him out. But more importantly...
向真嗣道歉？认识他快一年了，我还是没完全了解他。但更重要的是...

H-he... He's... He's already home?!
他...他已经...已经回家了？！

"Oh, h-hi Asuka." He said noticing me as he turned around.
"哦，嗨，明日香。" 他转过身来注意到我，说道。

I admit, the ability to speak temporarily left me as I faced the Third Child once more.
我承认，面对第三子时，我一时语塞，说不出话来。

I don't believe it! Here I was w-worrying about him, going over what I was going to say to him, trying to guess how all this is gonna go! And he has the audacity to come home before me and carry on like nothing has happened? He's even humming a tune?! Does he not care?
我不敢相信！我在这里为他担心，反复思考要跟他说什么，猜测这一切会如何发展！而他竟敢比我先回家，还若无其事地继续生活？甚至哼着小曲？！他难道不在乎吗？

I felt my pulse quicken as I stared at him, thinking fast I proceeded with the first thing that came to mind.
我盯着他，心跳加速，迅速思考后，我决定先说出口的第一件事。

Attack. 攻击。

"Y-you... you idiot! How come you're home before me? W-where were you? I even went-"
“你……你这个笨蛋！你怎么比我先到家？你去哪儿了？我甚至还——”

I stopped mid-sentence, not wanting him to know about my visit to Hikari's or that I had been thinking about searching for him. Though he had cowered slightly as I spoke, he recovered with a small cough, that now familiar smile radiating submissive friendliness.
我话说到一半就停住了，不想让他知道我去过光那里，也不想让他知道我一直在找他。尽管他在我说话时稍微缩了一下，但他随即轻咳一声，那种熟悉的微笑再次浮现，透出一种顺从的友好。

"O-oh I, er... I just went for a w-walk. I just wanted to clear m-my head." He finished quietly, looking away.
"哦-哦，我，呃... 我只是去散了个步。我只是想清醒一下头脑。" 他轻声说完，目光移开。

A walk! He argues with me and then just walks it off?! I don't think I will ever understand him. Shinji spoke further, taking my silence as permission.
散步！他跟我吵架然后就去散步消气？！我觉得我永远也理解不了他。真嗣继续说下去，把我的沉默当作允许。

"Did... did you...-" "你... 你...-"

I could tell by the look on his face that I wasn't going to like where this is going.
从他脸上的表情我就能看出来，我不可能喜欢接下来要发生的事。

No.

No, Shinji, don't you even think about it.
不，真嗣，你连想都别想。

"Did you g-go looking...f-for me?" He stuttered through the words, his face bright red.
“你……你是不是在……找我？”他结结巴巴地说着，脸涨得通红。

And there it is. 就在那里。

Despite what must have been an embarrassing question, he was looking straight at me. It's not often Shinji looks me in the eyes, certainly not with such a determined stare. I'm used to looks of lust or jealousy from others. But this? Blue eyes with a clear, honest... innocent intent. I felt my face heating up under his gaze. Damn it Asuka, keep it together!
尽管那一定是个令人尴尬的问题，他却直视着我。真嗣很少直视我的眼睛，更不用说用如此坚定的目光了。我习惯了别人充满欲望或嫉妒的眼神。但这个？清澈、诚实的...带着纯真的蓝色眼睛。在他的注视下，我感觉自己的脸颊在发热。该死，明日香，保持冷静！

"N-nevermind that! Where's Misato?" I barely kept my voice steady as I walked into the kitchen proper. The previous scent of burnt food now replaced with the airy freshness of pine and citrus from whatever Shinji used to clean. It was almost spotless.
「那、那不重要！美里在哪里？」我几乎无法保持声音的平稳，走进了厨房。原本烧焦食物的气味已被松木和柑橘的清新所取代，那是真嗣用来清洁的东西。这里几乎一尘不染。

"Misato's not here." “美里不在这里。”

Shinji and his amazing powers of deduction. Where would we be without him?
真嗣和他的惊人推理能力。没有他我们该怎么办？

I suppressed the urge to smack him and let out a frustrated growl.
我强忍住想揍他的冲动，发出了一声沮丧的低吼。

"I can see that. Is she still at work?" I could see a light bulb go off in Shinji's head, his eyes widening for a second before he shut his mouth and looked away, returning to his task of cleaning the kitchen top.
"我能看出来。她还在工作吗？" 我看到真嗣脑海中灵光一闪，他的眼睛瞬间睁大，随即闭上嘴，转过头去，继续清洁厨房台面。

"She'll be back late. S-she phoned to say she'd be spending the evening with... K-Kaji." Hesitantly answered, his back now to me. Which is good because it meant he didn't see my frown at the mention of Kaji... and who he's spending time with. I never liked being reminded at how easy it was for Misato to hold that man's attention.
"她会很晚回来。她打电话来说她晚上要和... K-Kaji 一起过。" 他犹豫地回答，背对着我。这样也好，因为他没看到我听到 Kaji 的名字时皱起的眉头...以及他和谁在一起。我总是不喜欢被提醒，Misato 是多么容易吸引那个男人的注意。

Silence settled in the kitchen as Shinji continued to clean and I sat myself down, my mood soured, trying to find the right words to say to him. What am I afraid of?
厨房里陷入了沉默，真嗣继续清洁，而我坐了下来，心情变得沉重，试图找到合适的话对他说。我在害怕什么？

Because he told me he cared.
因为他告诉我他在乎。

Afraid that he meant what he said, that he was being genuine. It wasn't something I could ignore. Steeling myself for what I was about to do I called out to him. I knew if I asked him directly he would just retreat, this had to be done with grace.
害怕他说的都是真心话，他是认真的。这不是我可以忽视的事情。我鼓起勇气，准备做我即将要做的事，于是我向他喊话。我知道如果我直接问他，他会退缩，这必须做得优雅。

"Hey Shinji..." "嘿，真嗣……"

He must've noticed the tone of my voice as he turned around slowly, as if he was afraid of another argument, his face showing just the tiniest hint of fear. Making eye contact once more, I continued.
他一定注意到了我声音的语气，因为他慢慢地转过身来，好像害怕再次争吵，脸上只露出一丝丝恐惧。再次目光相接，我继续说道。

"What were you trying to make... before?" I winced at having to remind both of us of our earlier argument but figured this approach was best. He didn't say anything though he started to fidget, no doubt trying to find the words to express himself. Knowing what I knew now, I could understand a little bit of his hesitation.
"你之前想做的是什么...？" 我因不得不提醒我们之前的争执而皱眉，但认为这种方法最好。他虽然没有说话，但开始不安地动来动去，无疑是在寻找表达自己的词语。现在我知道了这些，我能理解他的一些犹豫。

I allowed a smile to show through, hopefully in a reassuring manner. Hoping to get him to talk.
我露出一个微笑，希望能以一种令人安心的方式。希望能让他说话。

"I-I was only trying to... trying to make..." His voice ran into a whisper at this point and I didn't hear the rest. He looked down and I could tell he was slipping away again. I fought to keep my own temper down in response.
"我...我只是想...想做..." 他的声音到这时变成了耳语，我没听清剩下的部分。他低下头，我能看出他又在逃避。我努力控制自己的情绪，不让自己发火。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"...strudel. A-apple strudel." He got out finally.
"...果馅卷饼。苹果馅的。" 他终于说出来了。

Again, Shinji surprised me. His words triggering memories and experiences I hadn't visited since I arrived in this damned country and for a second I lost myself in thought.
又一次，真嗣让我感到意外。他的话勾起了我自从来到这个该死的国家后就未曾触及的记忆和经历，有那么一瞬间，我陷入了沉思。

Our first battle, together inside Unit-02, both of us in red plugsuits.
我们第一次并肩作战，一起在二号机内，两人都穿着红色的插入栓服。

"Argh! You're thinking in Japanese aren't you? If you must think do it in German."
"啊！你在用日语思考对吧？如果非要想的话，用德语吧。"

"er, well I'll try...er, strudel, bratwurst-"
"呃，好吧，我试试...呃，果馅卷，烤香肠-"

Just for a second though. I shook my head and focused back on Shinji.
不过就一瞬间。我摇了摇头，重新把注意力集中在真嗣身上。

"And you were making it for me?" I leant forward on the table, eager to hear his response.
"你是在为我做这个吗？" 我向前倾靠在桌子上，急切地想听他的回答。

"Y-yeah." "嗯-嗯。"

"Well you didn't do a very good job, Third."
"好吧，Third，你做得可不太好。"

"I-I know that." He blushed immediately and I couldn't help but smirk a little. Teasing him was always fun. Too easy, Third Child, too easy. I got up and made my way around the the table to stand beside him. I tilted my head just slightly upwards at him to make eye contact. Since when had he grown taller? Another battle I've lost to him, hmph.
"我-我知道。" 他立刻脸红了，我不禁微微一笑。逗他总是很有趣。太简单了，三号机，太简单了。我站起身，绕过桌子走到他身边。我微微抬头看向他，试图与他目光相接。他什么时候长这么高了？又一场我输给他的较量，哼。

I took a deep breath and resisted the urge to look at anywhere else.
我深吸一口气，强忍着不去看其他地方。

"Shinji... before, when-"
"真嗣... 之前，当-"

"It's ok." A small smile on his face. Looking at him then, I could tell it never quite reached his eyes. No, let me do this Shinji, I can't let today go.
"没事的。" 他脸上挂着一丝微笑。但那时看着他，我能感觉到这笑容并未触及他的眼底。不，让我来吧，真嗣，我不能让今天就这样过去。

"But-" "但——"

"Asuka, it's been a long day and I know you were hungry. I'm sorry I b-burnt our dinner. Do... do you w-want to order take-out?" Again that hopeful look.
"明日香，今天已经很晚了，我知道你饿了。对不起，我把晚饭烧焦了。你……你想点外卖吗？" 他又露出了那种充满希望的表情。

"Ah... I've already eaten at Hikari's."
"啊……我已经在光那里吃过了。"

"Oh." He looked like a kicked puppy and I felt my heart sink. Great job, Asuka. We stood there in silence for a moment, unsure how to continue until...
“哦。”他看起来像只被踢了一脚的小狗，我的心也随之沉了下去。干得好，明日香。我们站在那里沉默了一会儿，不知道该如何继续，直到……

*GROWL* *咕噜*

It was my turn to blush this time, I'm sure the heat radiating off my face would've been enough to enough to cook with. I fought to keep my composure in front of Shinji as I saw, for just the briefest moment, his eyes flick down to my stomach in surprise. At that moment I wanted nothing more than to run to my room and bury myself under the covers. I held my head in my hands with a verbal sigh.
这次轮到我脸红了，我敢肯定，我脸上的热度足以用来烹饪了。我在真嗣面前努力保持镇定，只见他惊讶地瞥了一眼我的肚子，只那一瞬间。那一刻，我只想跑回自己的房间，把自己埋在被子里。我双手抱着头，发出了一声叹息。

"Ugh... why me?" I asked no one in particular.
"呃...为什么是我？" 我自言自语道。

Shinji for his part just smiled I found myself returning it, lifting my head, embarrassment quickly fading as we exchanged a look. No judgement in his eyes, shining with a little happiness within them. After several seconds, something from our sync training kicked in and we both automatically turned, him towards the phone, me towards the list we keep of places and numbers for ordering out.
真嗣只是微笑着，我发现自己在回应他的笑容，抬起头来，尴尬感迅速消退，我们交换了一个眼神。他的眼中没有评判，闪烁着一丝快乐。几秒钟后，我们的同步训练起了作用，我们俩不约而同地转身，他朝向电话，我则朝向我们用来点外卖的地点和号码清单。

As we ordered and waited for delivery we fell back into our usual habits. I sat myself back at the table, idly going through the German cookbook Shinji had acquired. There's some pretty good stuff in here.
在点餐并等待送餐的过程中，我们又回到了平时的习惯。我坐回到桌前，随意翻阅着真嗣拿来的德语食谱。这里面有些相当不错的菜谱。

"You know Shinji, maybe you could try something simpler next time." I said with a smirk. Shinji whirled around, an indignant look on his face.
"你知道吗，真嗣，也许下次你可以尝试一些更简单的东西。" 我带着一丝戏谑说道。真嗣猛地转过身来，脸上带着愤愤不平的表情。

"H-hey! I told you I've never made it before and it's not like you h-helped!"
"嘿！我告诉过你我以前从来没做过，而且你也没帮我！"

"Oh, you wanted my help? All you had to do was ask Shinji... though why am I not surprised you couldn't handle proper food on your own?" A giggle escaped me as I saw him turn red.
"哦，你想要我的帮助吗？你只需要开口问真嗣... 不过我为什么一点也不惊讶你一个人搞不定像样的食物呢？" 我看到他脸红的样子，忍不住笑出声来。

And so back and forth we carried on for the remainder of the evening, the usual barbs and insults toned down and replaced with something more friendly. I'll admit it was nice to just talk with someone, no distractions, no hidden meanings, no expectations of something more.
于是我们这样你来我往地持续了整个晚上，那些平常的嘲讽和侮辱变得温和，取而代之的是更加友好的交流。我得承认，能和某人单纯地聊天，没有干扰，没有隐含的深意，没有对更多事情的期待，这种感觉真好。

This was my apology to him. I think he understood that too.
这是我向他道歉的方式。我想他也明白了这一点。

A few times I caught him staring and I found that I didn't immediately break contact and neither did he. We didn't say anything about these looks between us, comfortable in spending the evening as it was, eating our food and putting a very drunk Misato to bed when she finally crawled in. God, does that woman have no shame?
有好几次我注意到他在凝视我，我发现我并没有立刻移开视线，他也没有。我们没有对这些目光交流说什么，只是心照不宣地享受着这个夜晚，吃着食物，并在醉醺醺的美里最终爬进来时把她安顿好。天哪，那个女人真是毫无羞耻之心吗？

Those looks... stayed with us long after the night had finished and we had both gone to bed. I'm certain he saw what I couldn't put into words.
那些眼神...在我们各自就寝后，长夜已尽之时，依旧萦绕心头。我确信他读懂了我难以言表的心思。

You told me you care and I think... I do too.
你告诉我你在乎我，我想...我也一样。

With a smile on my face, I finally fell asleep.
带着微笑，我终于沉入了梦乡。

The End 完结

Author note: 作者注：

Well there it is. The upcoming release of the final Rebuild film has dragged me back into the fandom and bloody hell, has it been a while! This was just one of a bunch of ideas that I had, I wanted to do something WAFFY because you can never have too many of those. I don't think there's anything in this fic that hasn't been done in less words by better writers but as this is my first fic in years I hope you can forgive me.
好了，就是这样。即将上映的最后一部《新世纪福音战士》重制版电影把我拉回了粉丝圈，该死的，真是久违了！这只是我众多想法中的一个，我想写点温馨治愈（WAFFY）的东西，因为这种故事永远不嫌多。我不认为这篇同人中有任何内容是其他更优秀的作者没有用更少的文字表达过的，但鉴于这是我多年来的第一篇同人作品，希望你们能原谅我。

Asuka was always a fun character to write because she's just so expressive, writing her from a first person point of view was a challenge! If nothing else, I hope she didn't stray too OOC. My aim being to never letting the reader doubt they are in the mind of anyone but Asuka. Shinji, I tried not to make too defiant but he's always been someone who does have that hidden strength that can appear when pushed. Not always, but it's there.
明日香一直是个有趣的写作角色，因为她非常富有表现力，以第一人称视角来写她是个挑战！无论如何，我希望她没有偏离角色太多。我的目标是让读者毫不怀疑他们正置身于明日香的内心世界。至于真嗣，我尽量不让他显得过于叛逆，但他总是一个在压力下能展现出隐藏力量的角色。虽然不总是如此，但那份力量确实存在。

My cooking related knowledge is basic at best so I kept the stuff around cookery, German and Japanese food intentionally vague. This was very much a test bed to see if I've got what it takes to return to fic writing, something I want to do. And like I said at the start, this is a oneshot because the only thing worse than a badly written Eva fic is an incomplete Eva fic.
我的烹饪相关知识相当基础，所以我故意对烹饪、德国和日本食物的描述保持模糊。这很大程度上是一个测试，看看我是否具备回归同人写作的能力，这是我想要做的事情。正如我一开始所说，这是一篇短篇作品，因为比糟糕的《EVA》同人更糟糕的，就是一篇未完成的《EVA》同人。

Thank you for reading this far, I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it, please R&R and till next time.
感谢您阅读到这里，希望您享受阅读的过程，就像我享受写作一样，请留下您的评论和反馈，期待下次再见。
