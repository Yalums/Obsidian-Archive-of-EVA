Soon. It would be soon.  
很快，就快了。

Mari illustrious Makinami. Female. English, with enough Japanese to be familiar. She wore red rimmed glasses. Tall, busty. This was the form she was given.  
真希波·玛丽·伊兰崔亚斯。女性。英语流利，日语也足够熟悉。她戴着红色边框的眼镜。身材高挑，丰满。这就是她被赋予的形象。

But where did she come from? Where was she born, or created? Why was she a child of Eva?  
但她从何而来？她出生于何地，或是如何被创造？为何她是 Eva 的孩子？

Even she did not know. It hadn't mattered. It didn't matter to Yui anyway, her first friend.  
连她自己也不清楚。这并不重要。对她的第一个朋友唯来说，这也不重要。

"What are your ambitions, Mari?" Yui had asked one day, long ago.  
"你的志向是什么，玛丽？" 很久以前的一天，由依曾这样问道。

"Mhm, I don't know. Couldn't tell you." Mari had answered then, in those days before the impact. It was amazing she had gone this far.  
"嗯，我不知道。说不清楚。" 玛丽当时回答道，那是在冲击发生之前的日子。她能走到今天这一步，真是令人惊讶。

Yui looked at her, incredulous, as the two women stood atop the building having lunch. "You have to want to do something." Yui said, "you don't have any ambitions or hopes?"  
由依难以置信地看着她，两位女士站在楼顶共进午餐。"你总得有些想做的事吧。" 由依说，"你没有任何志向或希望吗？"

"Nope!" Mari replied as she swung her feet through the bars of the railing while she leaned on her hands. "Live in the moment! Take what comes!"  
"不行！" 玛丽回答道，她一边用手撑着身体，一边晃动着双腿穿过栏杆。"活在当下！随遇而安！"

Mari noticed her friend's look was distracted. She looked down. "There he is." Yui said, "it's that man!"  
玛丽注意到她的朋友看起来心不在焉。她向下看去。"他就在那儿。" 由依说道，"就是那个男人！"

Mari looked down. Of the three people involved in the conversation after leaving the serious looking limo, one of them stood out to her. He was tall, handsome, with black hair and expressive eyes.  
玛丽向下望去。从那辆严肃的豪华轿车离开后参与对话的三人中，有一个人引起了她的注意。他高大英俊，黑发，眼神富有表现力。

Mari glanced at Yui and could tell the girl was smitten. It wasn't anything super obvious like in anime- it never was with Yui. Her interest was communicated by that level stare and slight smile. "I'm never going to meet him." Yui declared.  
茉莉瞥了一眼结衣，看得出这女孩已经心动了。这并不像动漫里那样明显——对结衣来说，从来都不是。她的兴趣通过那种平静的凝视和微微的笑容传达出来。“我永远也见不到他。”结衣宣称。

"What? Whyfore?" “什么？为什么？”

"Look at him." Yui said, "an important man, well connected and going places. He deserves one of those reprehensible bond girls- he looks like a supervillain. Not a mousy research scientist who can't even project her voice across the room."  
“看看他。”结衣说，“一个重要人物，人脉广泛，前途无量。他配得上那些令人讨厌的邦德女郎——他看起来就像个超级反派。而不是一个连声音都传不到房间另一头的胆小研究科学家。”

"Hmm." Mari said, lost in thought.  
"嗯。" 玛丽若有所思地说道。

Gendo Ikari really wanted to be left in peace, but this girl wasn't letting him. In fact, she had been rather insistent on being present from their first casual meeting. "I told you Mari, I'm not interested."  
源堂真希望自己能清静一下，但这女孩就是不让他如愿。事实上，从他们第一次偶然相遇开始，她就非常坚持要出现在他面前。"我告诉过你，玛丽，我没兴趣。"

"Oh? You, pass up an opportunity? That's not like you. I can read sniveling ambition all over your face. You hide it well enough behind your serious, isolated mask, but I know what's up. Your plotting moves even now."  
"哦？你，放弃机会？这可不像你。我从你脸上就能看出那卑微的野心。你把它很好地隐藏在你那严肃孤僻的面具之下，但我清楚你的底细。你的阴谋此刻仍在运作。"

"Hmm." Gendo replied, dismissing her.  
"嗯。" 源渡回应道，对她不予理会。

Mari smirked. "It's just one coffee. If you're not impressed with my contact, then you never have to take me seriously again. But, you know, it could change your life. And where is your life going now, mister supervillain?"  
玛丽咧嘴一笑。"只是一杯咖啡而已。如果你对我的联系人不感兴趣，那么你以后再也不必认真对待我了。但是，你知道，这可能会改变你的生活。而现在，你的生活又走向何方呢，大反派先生？"

Gendo stopped to consider that, because Mari had a point. He was spinning his wheels, trying and failing to grasp the power he wanted. His family couldn't be made to pay if he wasn't going to advance beyond a mere salaryman. Mari's offer of an in-depth contact to the organization he worked for, under the table, was tantalizing.  
源渡停下来思考了一下，因为玛丽说得有道理。他一直在原地打转，试图抓住他想要的力量却屡屡失败。如果他不能超越一个普通上班族的层次，他的家人也不应该为此付出代价。玛丽提出的私下接触他所在组织的深入联系，确实令人心动。

"Okay." Gendo grunted, "Who is your contact?"  
“好吧。”源渡咕哝道，“你的联系人是谁？”

Fuyutsuki was walking alone, away from the temple and the ceremony. After he fulfilled his obligation to Yui, he slipped out quietly. It was about half a kilometer behind him now, he needed the distance.  
冬月独自一人走着，远离了寺庙和仪式。在履行了对唯的义务后，他悄悄地溜了出来。现在大约离那里有半公里远了，他需要这样的距离。

A bus stop was coming up on the sidewalk. A woman was sitting there, under a pink parasail. He recognized the ruby red shoes the girl wore and came to a stop. "I see you couldn't bring yourself to stay either."  
人行道上即将出现一个公交站。一位女士坐在那里，身下是一顶粉色的遮阳伞。他认出了女孩脚上那双红宝石色的鞋子，便停下了脚步。“看来你也没能让自己留下。”

"I didn't even attend, Sensei." The woman replied.  
“我甚至都没去参加，老师。”女士回答道。

Fuyutsuki considered the lonely road this was, and then sat down beside her. He pulled a flask from his jacket. "I suppose us two sad souls can commiserate on lost love together, can't we?"  
冬月考虑着这条孤寂的路，然后在她旁边坐下。他从夹克里掏出一个酒瓶。“我想我们这两个伤心人可以一起哀悼逝去的爱情，不是吗？”

"Gendo was supposed to marry Yui. That's what mattered." Mari responded half to the air, half to herself and her visitor. Confusion was on her face as she stared into space and memory.  
"源渡本应与唯结婚，这才是关键。" 玛丽半是对着空气，半是对着自己和她的访客回应道。她面露困惑，凝视着虚空与记忆。

Fuyutsuki stared at the pavement in sadness for a moment before taking a swig. Alone, then. "To fate and happiness." The teacher offered a sarcastic toast.  
冬月悲伤地凝视着路面片刻，随后喝了一口酒。孤身一人，那么。"向命运和幸福干杯。" 这位教师带着讽刺举杯。

Mari continued staring. "I don't understand... I thought this was the end. I thought uniting them was my purpose. I thought I would find happiness afterward."  
玛丽继续凝视着。"我不明白...我以为这就是结局。我以为让他们团聚是我的使命。我以为之后我会找到幸福。"

"Your problem is making your happiness dependent upon other people, miss Iscarot. What of yourself? What is it you wish for?"  
"你的问题在于将幸福寄托于他人身上，伊斯卡罗特小姐。你自己呢？你真正渴望的是什么？"

Mari struggled still with Yui's question even now after these few years. She still did not know. "I thought helping others I cared for was it."  
玛丽至今仍在思索由依的这个问题，即便过了几年依旧无解。她仍不清楚。"我以为帮助我在乎的人就是答案。"

Fuyutsuki grunted. "Admirable, but vacant, isn't it?" He looked at the pavement and spoke for the audience of two. "A thankless existence, playing the part of a background actor. At the end of it you wonder what value you take out of the experience… of being close to fulfillment, but never quite there. It makes you wonder what it is you're living for."  
冬月哼了一声。"值得赞赏，却空洞无物，不是吗？"他望着地面，对着两位听众说道。"一种无回报的生活，扮演着背景演员的角色。到最后你会疑惑，从这段经历中你究竟得到了什么价值……接近满足，却始终未能触及。这让你不禁思考，你究竟为何而活。"

Mari smirked. "You enjoy living at the edges though, Sensei. The spotlight was never for you."  
玛丽咧嘴一笑。“老师，您就喜欢生活在边缘地带。聚光灯从来就不适合您。”

Fuyutsuki nodded. "Whereas you have greater things ahead of you, Mari. You aren't settled yet. Go forth and live your life. Forget about us. Go, discover your purpose out there. When you return, perhaps you will be ready to see things with the perspective you were meant to."  
冬月点头道：“而你，玛丽，你面前有更伟大的事物。你还未安定下来。去吧，去活出你的人生。忘了我们。去吧，去外面寻找你的目的。当你回来时，或许你就能以你本应有的视角看待事物了。”

Mari set her determined expression. "Okay!"  
玛丽摆出一副坚定的表情。“好的！”

Fuyutsuki took another long swig of the flask, capped it, and stood. Though he walked away from the empty bus stop, his regrets continued to follow him.  
冬月又长饮一口酒壶，盖上盖子，站起身来。尽管他离开了空无一人的公交站，但他的悔恨依旧如影随形。

She traveled the world then, doing many things and being many people. She tried being responsible, she tried being shy. She tried being raunchy, she tried being a nerd.  
那时，她游历世界，尝试过许多角色和身份。她尝试过负责任，尝试过害羞。她尝试过放荡不羁，尝试过做个书呆子。

She read books, played games, talked to people but never staying long enough to be remembered.  
她读书，玩游戏，与人交谈，却从不逗留足够长的时间让人记住她。

When she returned to Japan, she was a spy. One of the Bond girls ready for action; Bang! Bang! But what she collided with on that sunny day was something unexpected.  
当她回到日本时，她是一名间谍。一位准备行动的邦德女郎；砰！砰！但在那个阳光明媚的日子里，她所遭遇的却是意料之外的事物。

Him.

She played it cool as she leaned into the role she played today, chastising Ryoji for a miscommunication. But she couldn't resist, after hanging up, investigating this person of interest in her own way.  
她今天扮演的角色中，她冷静地责备了良治的沟通失误。但在挂断电话后，她忍不住以自己的方式调查这位感兴趣的人。

By smelling him. 通过闻他的气味。

"LCL. My favorite smell in the world…" she backed up and stood. The boy was familiar, someone… some persons from a lifetime ago. Or was it now? Or then?  
"LCL. 这是我最喜欢的味道……" 她后退一步，站起身来。那个男孩很熟悉，是某个人……某个来自遥远时光的人。还是现在？或是那时？

But she was a spy, now. She had to do spy things. "Lets just keep this between us, huh NERV puppy?"  
但她现在是间谍了。她必须做间谍该做的事。"就我们俩知道，好吗，NERV 的小狗？"

He looked like a puppy, anyway. Big sad eyes, laying on his back, looking up at her with utter confusion in his face.  
他看起来就像只小狗，大大的悲伤眼睛，仰面躺着，满脸困惑地仰望着她。

She ran down the stairs carrying her parachute and satchel. She disposed of it all in a dumpster and tried to resume doing her spy stuff. Her mission: during the next Angel Attack she would steal unit 02 and navigate it to a waiting submarine offshore for transport to Russia.  
她背着降落伞和挎包冲下楼梯，将一切丢弃在垃圾箱里，试图继续执行她的间谍任务。她的使命：在下一次使徒袭击中，她将盗取二号机，并将其驾驶至近海等待的潜艇上，运往俄罗斯。

If she felt like it. Operations like this were unpredictable, after all. Anything could happen.  
如果她愿意的话。毕竟，这样的行动总是充满变数。任何事情都可能发生。

But that boy… that boy itched. He itched in her mind, long after that fateful encounter on the rooftop that was supposed to go away like everyone else that tried to matter to her.  
但那个男孩……那个男孩让她心烦意乱。他在她脑海中挥之不去，远在那次本应像其他人一样消逝的屋顶邂逅之后。

He _itched_. 他感到痒痒的。

---

Catastrophe. War. Death. Genocide. Extinction. She floated above it all, surviving on the wind like the pink parasail she left behind years ago. The ruby red shoes guided her.  
灾难。战争。死亡。种族灭绝。灭绝。她漂浮在这一切之上，像多年前留下的粉色滑翔伞一样，依靠风生存。那双红宝石般的鞋子引导着她。

Except now they took the form of her Evangelion. Unit 08. WILLE didn't care where it came from or how she got it. They just needed it in their fight against NERV and the architects of the broken world. That's when Mari met _her_.  
只不过现在它们化身为她的福音战士。第 8 号机。WILLE 不在乎它是从哪里来的，或者她是怎么得到的。他们只需要它在对抗 NERV 和这个破碎世界的建筑师们的战斗中。就在那时，玛丽遇到了她。

She was a broken thing, released from prison but still trapped in her mind. Only one bar was needed though, the one in her head. It pinned her humanity to her frame.  
她是一具破碎的躯壳，虽已出狱，心智却仍囚禁于牢笼。只需一道枷锁，那道心中的枷锁，便将她的人性牢牢钉在身躯之上。

She was so _fascinating_. Mari knew it from the first moment, colliding with the girl called the second child, mashing their cheeks together. "One of the children! This is amazing, I've heard stories about you! It's an honor to finally meet you!"  
她是如此迷人。玛丽从初次邂逅那一刻便知晓，与那位被称为第二适格者的少女相撞，脸颊紧贴。“你就是那个孩子！太神奇了，我听过关于你的故事！终于见到你，真是荣幸！”

"Just stay away from me." Asuka growled. She didn't shove Mari away though, just turned her head. The contrast between words and actions was as much of a draw to Mari as a candy store was to starving children.  
“离我远点。”明日香低吼道。她并未推开玛丽，只是转过头去。言语与行动间的反差，对玛丽而言，其吸引力不亚于糖果店之于饥饿的孩童。

This was going to be _fun_!  
这一定会很有趣！

For fifteen years she played the role of a soldier. She fought when she was told to, rested when she could, and continued to read in some of the moments in between.  
十五年来，她扮演着士兵的角色。命令她战斗时她便战斗，能休息时便休息，并在这些间隙中继续阅读。

In other moments though, she was something else: _committed_. Asuka was everything to Mari from a sister to a standoff girlfriend. Somewhere in between. The specifics didn't matter. The redhead needed someone stable and present in her life, and Mari was more than happy to fill the role.  
然而在其他时刻，她又是另一种身份：坚定不移。明日香对玛丽而言，既是姐妹也是疏离的女友，介于两者之间。具体是什么并不重要。这位红发女孩需要生活中有一个稳定且存在的人，而玛丽非常乐意扮演这个角色。

Intimacy went only to a point though. Mari pushed, but only to a limit, for two reasons. The first was that it wasn't what Asuka wanted- the girl was channeling those energies elsewhere. There was a sadness there, and Mari didn't want to push if her partner wouldn't get satisfaction from the experience. She knew it would be a violation, and that was the last thing Mari wanted to give the second children.  
亲密虽有界限。玛丽虽有推动，但仅限于一定程度，原因有二。首先，这不是明日香所愿——那女孩将精力投向了别处。其中蕴含着悲伤，玛丽不愿在伴侣无法从中获得满足时强求。她明白那将是一种侵犯，而这正是玛丽最不愿给予第二适格者的。

But… also… it didn't feel _proper_ to Mari. Asuka was… predetermined. Something in her being told her that Asuka was not meant for that place, as Mari wasn't meant in that way for Asuka.  
然而……也……对玛丽来说，这感觉并不妥当。明日香是……命中注定的。某种直觉告诉她，明日香不属于那个位置，正如玛丽也不应以那种方式属于明日香。

Perhaps, Mari thought as she paused alone next to unit 08, that her purpose had something to do with it.  
或许，玛丽独自站在 08 号机旁时思索，她的使命与此有关。

She laughed. Yeah, right. She lived for herself since that day, her purpose before had been a misplaced thought in the beginning. Her purpose now, she believed, was to experience as much as humanly possible.  
她笑了。是啊，没错。自从那天起，她就为自己而活，之前的目的是一开始就错位的想法。她现在相信，她的目的是尽可能多地体验人生。

And she had a long way to go.  
而她还有很长的路要走。

---

Princess was such an apt name for the redhead that it came casually to Mari long before she found the fairytale. Mari thought it had been mere coincidence then, and when Asuka reciprocated with a name of her own for her (four eyes) it felt like just another tick in their quirky relationship. One that Mari felt comfortable with. One that would go on forever.  
公主这个称呼对红发女孩来说再合适不过了，早在玛丽发现那个童话之前，这个名字就自然而然地出现在她的脑海中。玛丽当时以为这只是巧合，而当明日香也给她起了个名字（四眼）时，这感觉就像是他们古怪关系中的又一个标记。一个让玛丽感到舒适的关系。一个会永远持续下去的关系。

But that changed the day he came back.  
但那一天，他回来后，一切都变了。

"Who is this sad pup…" Mari stopped. The photo she held in her hand was of a boy she had seen before. _The itchy one_.  
“这是谁家的小可怜……”玛丽停了下来。她手中拿着的照片上是一个她曾见过的男孩。那个让人心痒痒的家伙。

Asuka, behind her in that small cubby of a residence, glanced over her shoulder at the photo and didn't answer at first. "A ghost." She answered. "Someone who didn't matter until now."  
在那个狭小的住所里，站在她身后的明日香瞥了一眼照片，起初没有回答。“一个幽灵。”她回答道，“一个直到现在才重要的人。”

Mari knew her Princess long enough to read the loads of information in that response… and Mari would have commented if she herself were not swept up in emotion of her own. This one. The puppy.  
玛丽对她的公主了解甚深，足以从那句回答中读出大量信息……如果她自己没有被自己的情感所淹没，她本会发表评论的。就是这只。这只小狗。

The photo was part of the briefing packet. Their next op. They were going to space.  
那张照片是简报资料的一部分。他们的下一个任务。他们即将前往太空。

To bring the puppy back to Earth.  
将这只小狗带回地球。

It was so… _emotional_, to compare the two of them now. The Princess and the Puppy. Somehow these two mattered. If for no other reason, than to see Princess' reaction to the puppy. In the fourteen years of knowing Asuka, never had she seen the girl so closeted in denial and ritual surrounding this boy than she had seen any other time. Nothing- not even Mari herself- moved Asuka in this way.  
这真是太…感性了，将他们两人现在进行比较。公主与小狗。不知为何，这两者很重要。如果不是为了别的，至少是为了看公主对小狗的反应。在认识明日香的十四年里，她从未见过这个女孩像现在这样，对这个男孩的否认和仪式如此封闭，比以往任何时候都要严重。没有什么——甚至包括玛丽自己——能以这种方式触动明日香。

It was _fun_! 这很有趣！

---

And then, it wasn't. The day of the Last Battle. The day where they all went to the south pole together.  
然后，它不再有趣了。那是最后一战的当天。那天，他们一起去了南极。

It was the day she finally saw the puppy again, colliding with him from behind and reintroducing herself. It was more for Asuka's sake- she needed to say what she did. Mari was there only to facilitate this meeting. At least, so she told herself. Mari also needed to know if he still _itched_.  
那是她终于再次见到那只小狗的日子，从后面撞上他并重新介绍自己。这更多是为了明日香——她需要说出她所做的事。玛丽在场只是为了促成这次会面。至少，她是这么告诉自己的。玛丽也想知道他是否还感到痒。

He did. 他确实还痒。

She didn't understand it. At least, not until she saw the massive white plain of the South Pole from the cockpit of her Evangelion. Something was… odd. For Mari Illustrious Makinami- the woman with no home, no family, no parents- this place felt… familiar.  
她起初并不理解。至少，直到她从她的福音战士驾驶舱中看到南极那片巨大的白色平原时，她才有所领悟。有些事情……很奇怪。对于玛丽·伊莉莎白·麦克尼尔——这个没有家、没有家人、没有父母的女人来说，这个地方感觉……很熟悉。

WUNDER dove beyond the barrier and battle was joined. Mari leaned on all of her combat experience that she accrued in the fourteen years of being a mercenary. She fought, she won. No enemy set before her proved more than an inconvenience, and she fought as the actors played their parts in the drama of saving the Earth.  
WUNDER 冲破屏障，战斗随即打响。玛丽依靠十四年佣兵生涯积累的战斗经验，奋力作战，屡战屡胜。任何挡在她面前的敌人都不过是小麻烦，她如同演员在拯救地球的戏剧中扮演角色一般，英勇奋战。

But why was she… here? Why was she winning so much? And why was she so drawn to the Puppy, saving Asuka the princess? Why did she feel so compelled to act in this way, here, to move towards them and bring them together?  
但为何她会……在这里？为何她能屡战屡胜？又为何她对拯救公主明日香的“小狗”如此着迷？为何她感到如此强烈地想要采取行动，在这里，向他们靠近，将他们撮合在一起？

It… felt… like… 这……感觉……像是……

Mari was home. She was where she was supposed to be, and always had been. Her apartment across town was small and modest, but it served to house the librarian she had become. It was just a few streets over from where she worked, although Mana was taking over those responsibilities today. She had someone to go see.  
玛丽在家。她身处应属之地，一直如此。她在城那头的公寓虽小且朴素，却足以安顿她这位图书管理员的身份。离她工作的地方只隔了几条街，尽管今天由真负责那些事务。她有个人要去见。

White collared shirt, grey vest, pink coat. The red rims sat on her face as they always did. She didn't do anything with her hair, she didn't need to. She left that morning and crossed the street, headed for the train station.  
白色立领衬衫，灰色马甲，粉色外套。红色镜框一如既往地架在她的脸上。她没有打理头发，也不需要。那天早上她出门，穿过街道，朝火车站走去。

Down the steps and… there he was. His back was to her. Across the tracks were the shadow of their friends. Mari stepped up behind the puppy- Shinji- and put her hands over his eyes. "Who is it?" She asked playfully.  
走下台阶，然后……他就在那里。背对着她。轨道对面是他们朋友的身影。玛丽悄悄走到小狗——真嗣——身后，用手蒙住他的眼睛，俏皮地问：“猜猜我是谁？”

"Uhh… a gorgeous girl with big boobs!" Shinji replied.  
"呃……一个波霸美女！" 真嗣回答道。

"Bingo!" Mari said, crossing around him. She leaned in, taking a big whiff of him. "You smell fine as usual, the scent of an adult?"  
"答对了！" 玛丽说着绕到他身边，凑近他深深吸了一口气。"你还是一如既往地好闻，成年人的香气？"

He reached towards her, picking the glasses off her face. "And you're being cute, as usual."  
他伸手摘下她的眼镜，"而你，一如既往地可爱。

"Ooho! Talking like a real adult now!" Mari answered him.  
"哦嗬！现在说话像个真正的成年人了！" 玛丽回答他。

She reached in to take off his choker. After that, the world began to spin.  
她伸手去解开他的项圈。之后，世界开始旋转起来。

This… this was home. 这里……这就是家。

Shinji extended his hand and together they ran up the steps… but… she wouldn't be going with him.  
真嗣伸出手，两人一起跑上台阶……但是……她不会跟他一起走。

They ran out together out of the train station and across the yard. The sun played on her face as she ran with him, towards the exit. Towards leaving the imaginary space.  
他们一起跑出了火车站，穿过院子。阳光照在她奔跑的脸上，和他一起，朝着出口跑去。朝着离开这个虚幻空间的方向。

She took her last breath, then released his hand.  
她吸了最后一口气，然后松开了他的手。

Shinji half turned but didn't stop running. He only glanced backwards at her, and she at him, as she started to disintegrate. It was all making sense now. She had no home, because _this_ was her home.  
真嗣半转身子，但并未停下奔跑。他只是向后瞥了她一眼，而她也回望着他，随即开始消散。一切现在都明了了。她没有家，因为这里就是她的家。

She had no family because… she wasn't real. She was mere fiction. She always was. Just as this place always was.  
她没有家人，因为……她并非真实存在。她只是虚构的。她一直都是。正如这个地方一直都是。

As Shinji retreated, finding himself in the rapidly speeding entry plug of Evangelion unit 08, Mari stayed behind as her world collapsed all around her. Her job was done. The task Shinji created her for- to bring him to this place and return him to Asuka, was complete. The story was coming to a close.  
随着真嗣撤退，发现自己身处飞速前进的 EVA 08 号机的插入栓中，玛丽留在了原地，她的世界在四周崩塌。她的任务完成了。真嗣创造她来完成的使命——将他带到这个地方并送回明日香身边，已经达成。故事即将落幕。

With her last gasps of consciousness she watched the world turn into illustration all around her. The color leached out, becoming lines on a page. She looked at her hands, also turning to line work and pen.  
在意识即将消散的最后一刻，她目睹着世界在她周围化为插画。色彩褪去，变成了纸上的线条。她看向自己的双手，也正逐渐变为线条和墨迹。

Then stills. 接着是静止的画面。

Then words on a page.  
然后是纸上的文字。

Then… nothing. 然后… 什么也没有了。

_Happy birthday, Mari. 生日快乐，玛丽。_

_A/N: Mari's birthday snuck up on me, I thought it was April 9th based on an incorrect list. I apologize for how thin this is, it's more a stream of consciousness than a proper fic. But I'm using it to show an impression I had of Mari... that she's a product of the imaginary zone at the end of 3.0 + 1.0. Maybe next time if I'm still here I can give her something better.  
作者注：玛丽的生日突然就到了，我原本根据一份错误清单以为是在 4 月 9 日。很抱歉这篇内容单薄，与其说是正式的同人小说，不如说更像是一段意识流。但我用它来表达我对玛丽的一个印象——她是《终章》结尾处那个想象区域的产物。如果下次我还在这里，希望能为她写点更好的东西。_
