As always, spoiler warnings: this is an altered continuity, after  
episode 22.Here is the sequel to "I Mustn't Run Away". (I'd advise that it have  
been recently read before reading this; find it atSorry it's so long. ^_^) This one is from Asuka's perspective. I reallyhope I got it right. I also hope that this, along with the previousstory, will show for sure that I do really like Asuka. Yes, really.(That is perhaps my biggest regret with NGEjd.)This story (and "I Mustn't Run Away", retroactively) is for MichaelBorgwardt, in particular. Have fun.***********************************************An Oddzilla Productions fanfic, by Andrew Huang.In Other WordsBased on Neon Genesis Evangelion, c. Gainax Studios and ADVision.  
I opened my eyes. Strange, I didn't remember closing them.Actually, what did I remember last? Ahh, my mind was too fuzzy. Iclosed my eyes again. That was when I heard Misato and Shinji talking.About me, it seemed.  
I would have sprung out of bed then-and I tried, but the blood lossto my head only let me fall limply to the floor instead, my eyes andears throbbing without mercy. I managed to crawl to the door, where Ilay for a few moments, listening. They were talking about...My mother?  
I froze.  
Apparently, so had they, because there was now a long pause. It seemedthat Misato had finished her story about me. Shinji wasn't sayinganything.  
Oh, God, Shinji knew? About...about...  
"I almost wish I hadn't asked," he finally said.  
"But now you understand," answered Misato. Almost a question.  
"I...I think so. Maybe." He paused. "I'm going to check on her beforeI go to bed."  
I panicked. I lurched to my feet, almost tripping on my blanket-Ihadn't realized that I had dragged it with me to my door-shuffled to mybed, flopped down, and feigned sleep. It was not a moment too soon,because I heard a soft knock an instant later, then the door slidingopen. I forced my face to relax, so as to make sure of the illusion ofblissful unconsciousness on my part.  
Hah, "forced my face to relax". Howodd.  
I've never tried to hide like this. No, not like this. Not that I canever remember.  
I heard his soft footsteps and him cursing quietly when he kicked oneof the textbooks on the floor by accident. I was facing away from thewall, towards him, and I cracked my eyelids a tiny bit open to look. Iquickly closed them again as I saw him kneel down next to me, feeling arush of air from the sudden movement. Apparently, his face was veryclose to mine, now-I could hear his breathing clearly. What was hedoing?  
He sighed, and I felt a finger brush my cheek, making me quiverinvoluntarily. But it was only because of his touch that I realized thatmy cheek was wet.  
Wet?  
As my addled brain wriggled out the conclusion that I had been cryingfor some reason, I felt something else, something softer, touch mycheek, while some moving air tickled my ear. There was a whisper next:"I...Asuka... Get better." Then, he seemed to vanish. I could feel himleave.  
I slowly sat up at the sound the closing door, and I touched my cheekwhere he had...kissed me.  
I'm not sure why, but I started to cry again.-  
Earlier, a long time earlier, I was doing some research on my fellowpilots, and I came upon Shinji's psych evaluation after his firstbattle, about how he had blanked out at first, then recalled what hadhappened much later. I am able to say that I know exactly what that hadbeen like...  
Recall usually starts with some sort of sensory input in the here-and-now that is the same or similar to something that happened when youfirst blanked out. Shinji had said in the report that a train rattlingover some tracks sounded very similar to the Angel pounding the EVA'shead with its energy spike. Mine was a sound, too. My own sobbing.  
I hate crying.  
Yellow light, gripping me. A hand from that light reaching into mymind, heart, soul. An eye, looking at me. Cold, ruthless, searching.Dirty, I felt dirty! I tried to hide, but there was nowhere to go. I sawwhat it saw, I saw what I didn't want to see. No escape. No exit.Mother! You left me! Why did you leave me?Someone telling Rei to get something and defeat the Angel. No, notthat, that, that doll. To be saved by her? I'd rather die. I'd ratherhave no one save me.No one...no one...no one no onenoonenoonesomeone?Yes, someone. Holding me, tight, with strong arms. Here and now."Shin...?" I heard myself ask."No, Asuka, but I'm right here," answered a mature female voice. "Youwere having a nightmare. It's okay. Shh, shh..." A gentle hand strokedmy hair.I think I almost felt disappointed, but any human contact now wassorely needed comfort. "Ma...ma..." though I knew immediately it wasn'tMama. I found myself shifting around to hug Misato, as the rest flewback to me.Yes, someone. Him. _Him_. Me. Me, moving. Me, moving out of the light,towards the doll. Taking that thing, turning around, throwing. It wasdone.No, it wasn't done. Sitting outside. Someone coming. Him, again. Him,talking. Him, grabbing me. Me, crying. I hate crying, but maybe not somuch now. Me, crying more, talking. Him...crying, too? Him, talking. Me,closing my eyes. Closing my eyes.I felt myself dropping off to sleep again, sinking into the warmth ofM...Misato's embrace, but not before hearing a set of footsteps and avoice. "What's wrong?" said the voice, a younger voice, a boyish voice.Everything. And nothing.-Again, I opened my eyes, though I was much more coherent this time.There was no sudden rush of repressed, terrible memories to throw meoff, because the memories were already there. I shivered, though it waswarm.As much as I wanted to, I knew I couldn't stay in bed forever. Mygrowling stomach reminded me of that, and I slowly rose, wiping thecrust out of my eyes.Ow. That was a lot of crust.I noted the dull glow from behind the shades, and looked at the clock.Barely 6 am. How long had I slept, yesterday? I tried to puzzle that outas I swung myself off the bed.Being so preoccupied, my foot almost landed on Shinji's face. Twocentimeters to the left, and I would have hit his nose. It was hisbreath on my toes that told me he was there.The surprise sent me falling back on my mattress, blinking. What washe doing...well, I suppose that would be a stupid question to ask. A bitof anger warred with...something else within me, for just an instant,but I calmed down. With care, I got out, and knelt down next to him. Twocan play at this game.He was lying on a sleeping bag, with his blanket on top, and using hisright arm as a pillow. Some part of me idly noted that the way his armwas positioned, it was probably completely numb from loss of blood flowto it. I shook the stray thought from my head, and studied him closelyin the dim light.His face was, at the moment, expressionless. For some reason, Iexpected something there-perhaps a smile, a frown...maybe tears, even.I don't know why.I didn't understand him. I couldn't see why he cared that much aboutme, if my memory served me correctly. He said he did, but I couldn'treally believe it. He was just a boy, he didn't know about things likethat.  
A whisper in my head. Just a child, he was.  
Another whisper in my head. But I was, too. So what would I know aboutthings like that?  
He shifted in his sleep, rolling even more onto his slightly twistedarm. I touched his hand. Cold, like I thought it would be. Then Itouched his cheek, like he had done to me a few times in the past days.Warm, like I thought it would be.  
He didn't even stir, except a little twitch in his brow.  
I quickly shut out visions of playing some prank on him. I wasn't inthe mood for that. Not really.  
To ensure that I would stay "not in the mood", I silently exited myroom, and headed for the kitchen. It really had been a while since Iate...  
Funny. As I put some bread in the toaster, I realized that except forthose momentary twinges when I had woken up, I wasn't feeling much ofanything at all. I was very calm, very cool, very controlled. It wasenough to be unnerving, were I capable of becoming unnerved at themoment.  
I wasn't sure what I was feeling, because it seemed like I wasn'tfeeling anything at all. This was annoying.  
Ah, at least I _was_ annoyed. That was something more familiar. Isighed. This wasn't helping much. I had come out here to think, too, butI kept on getting caught up in my own head.  
A soft scratching drew my attention. Pen-pen. My early breakfast wokehim, though I was sure I hadn't made much noise. Ah well. I scooped himup and held him tightly.  
I repressed the urge to talk to him, as intelligent as he seemed... Aquestion, though, rolled around in my mind: What happens now? I sighed,ruffling the feathers on his head with my breath. I was probably afraid.  
I couldn't feel it, exactly, but that had to be it.  
"Asuka?"  
I fell down, dropping Pen-pen, who squawked in surprise. It took me aninstant to analyze the voice and realize that it wasn't Shinji; rather,it was Misato.  
"Are you okay?" She was at my side, helping me up.  
"Ah, yeah. Th-thanks..."  
I eventually found myself eating toast silently, facing Misato. Ratherunusually, she was drinking some tea, studying me closely, throughevidently tired but attentive eyes. I decided to break the silence.  
"Shinji...you let him sleep in my room?"  
"Yes. After your...nightmare last night, he insisted that he stay withyou and keep watch." Her voice took on a slightly amused tone. "I thinkhe was disappointed that I made it to you first."  
"I see."  
"He really does care about you, you know."  
I didn't answer that. Instead, I asked something I had to ask. "Whydid you tell Shinji about my mother?" I said, in a voice I would barelyhave recognized as my own.  
Misato didn't seem at all caught off guard, but her eyes did dip tostudy her teacup before answering. "Shinji wanted to know. After whathappened yesterday...I think he had the right." She looked back up, andsmiled.  
"You're not angry, are you? I know it's not something you wantedto share particularly."  
Yes, of course. After what had happened with that...thing, he wouldwant to know. I couldn't blame him. But something still felt wrong aboutit.  
"I, I guess I'm not angry. Just...well, I don't know. You know?" Istopped, finishing the rest of my toast. Misato did not try to strike upmore conversation, for which I was grateful.  
I got up, and put my plate in the sink. "Misato..." My tongue wasthick and unresponsive, but I forced it to work. "Thank you for lastnight, too."  
"Of course." Her voice was warm, caring. I looked at her, and saw thesame warmth in her eyes and smile.  
I called her "Mama"? No, I couldn't have...  
I nodded, and went to take a bath.  
-I'd been quieter than usual, I know that. I suppose it was because Ireally didn't know what to say, definitely not to Shinji, not to Misato,and, were he around, not even to Kaji.  
I didn't cry when I heard. I felt terrible, yes...he was a friend, agood friend, but I didn't cry.  
I felt tired then...  
I thought I loved him. I really did. I know, some would say it wasjust one of those schoolgirl crushes...maybe even I would say that now,but at the time, it meant so much. I had this need to reach out. But whyhim? I was focusing on him, because he was someone already out of myreach, so it wouldn't really ever matter, you know, and... My need tobe self-sufficient superceded that reaching out, even then. It never wasreal. Ha, Misato got jealous every time he showed the slightest bit ofinterest in Ritsuko or Maya or any of the other women in NERV, but shenever even reacted slightly when I went on "dates" with him...in truth,he-  
Enough. He's not here anymore, like...  
No, she's gone, too. A long time ago. No more about her.  
What about the people who aren't gone?  
I've been pushing everyone away. It's easy to see that, isn't it? Andthen, if someone wouldn't be pushed away, then I would run away. Ormaybe I've just been running this whole time. I was pushing myself away.But, dammit, it's hard to run from a person when that person won't letgo of you.  
I don't understand, not him...not Misato, either. Who are thesepeople? I've done all of those things to them, but they don't care? Howdo they keep coming closer and closer to me? Why do they want to disruptmy life? It's been...it's been comfortable, this way. I like beingcomfortable, if nothing else.  
Well, perhaps, I should stop running away. Perhaps, someone orsomething is telling me to stop. Yes, perhaps. Ah, but it's so mucheasier to say that. To stop for real, well, that's something else,completely.  
Did I have a choice, though?  
I felt very tired.  
-  
I left the bathroom, adjusting my towel around me, feeling muchbetter...sort of. Passing the kitchen, I observed that Misato was beingtrue to her nature, now asleep. She had her head cushioned in her armsat the kitchen table, teacup knocked over. I managed to find the abilityto smile a bit. I continued on to my room, to get dressed for the day.  
I walked in, shuffled to my dresser, opened the towel, and was aboutto drop it, when I heard a sneeze behind me, a yawn, followed a bit ofrustling.  
Then there was something that sounded like choking.  
"I-I-I, I'll go out now, so you can, you can..." Some footstepsquickly padded their way to the door, which slid open, then softlyclacked shut.  
I have got to start remembering details like when there's someoneelse in my room.  
Once I managed to get out of my frozen, red-faced state, I put on myclothes and carefully walked out the door. As I had suspected, there wasShinji, sitting just outside, rubbing his arm.  
He looked up at me. Ilooked down at him.  
Time passed.  
Finally, he stood up, but we simply continued looking at each other,eye to eye.  
Well, sort of. The hallway was a little dark. Good enough, though. Isupposed so, anyway.  
Then, on some unspoken cue, perhaps a remnant of our synchronicitytraining, we broke eye contact, turned simultaneously, and walked toliving room. We both sat down on the couch, next to each other, andstared at our folded hands. I almost sighed with relief when he finallyspoke.  
"You, you're feeling okay?"  
"Yes."  
Oh, real good, Asuka. Give a one-word answer that just asks for moresilence.  
"Sorry about-"  
"It's all right. My fault I forgot you were in there."  
I suddenly found a hand around my own. I stiffened, but resisted theimpulse to snatch it away. Instead, I slowly pulled it out of his gentlegrip. "Please, don't."  
"Asuka?"  
"Don't touch me. Just don't." Why was I saying this?  
I could tell he was confused. Maybe as much as I was. Hadn't I justsaid that I was all right?  
"Are...are you sure you're okay?"  
See?  
"No, I suppose not," I snapped. A part of me was now rather horrified.I seemed to be losing control. "I just kind of went through something,you know? In case you hadn't noticed."  
"Yes, I know. I was there." There was strength in his voice, firmness.It made me blink. "And I said I'd be there for you."  
"Oh, you did, did you?"  
"I said I'd protect you."  
That earned a raised eyebrow from me.  
"They're just words."  
"I-no-they're not just words!" He actually sounded...indignant? Notquite, but something like it.  
I slowly turned to look at him, a rebuttal automatically finding itsway to my voice, then getting lodged somewhere in my throat.  
Those eyes, his eyes. I looked into them. They're actually a darkblue. I hadn't noticed before, in all the time I'd been around him. I'djust thought they were a deep brown that looked black, like mostJapanese. But I had to see now, so lit up by a fire in them. There wasintent, purpose, meaning in them. There was strength in them, the sameas his voice. This weak little boy had changed, sometime in the past fewdays.  
They might be just words, but words have power. Especially when youcan see when someone means them.  
And I was afraid.  
The frown on my face, almost a sneer, relaxed away. I now carefullyleft my expression blank. "Shinji, do you know what that thing did tome?"  
"What? You mean... It looked into your mind?"  
"Yes, it looked into my mind. But it did more than that. It lookedinto my mind, and made me look too. It forced its way into me. It tookout things from me. That thing had no right, but it went ahead. I didn'twant it to, you know that? I didn't want it looking there. It made mefeel dirty."  
The words came out faster, almost running into each other-I had tosay them, and quickly, or they might not be said... "You know what itdid to me? It raped me. It violated me. And you know about me, now, too.You know how I am. I'm a terrible person. I've done all that to you, toeveryone. I don't deserve anything. You should just leave me alone. Sodon't touch me."  
I was dimly aware that there were no tears from my eyes. They wereperfectly clear. But Shinji, that poor jerk, he was crying.  
"Don't say that! You aren't, I know you aren't... You couldn't be,because, because I, I, I-"  
"You love me?"  
Oh, the look on his face was priceless. If I had been even theslightest bit inclined to humor at that moment, I would have laughed.I didn't laugh.  
"Do I...do I, do I, I what?"  
"Do you love me? Is that what you're trying to say?"  
He looked down, face red, hands curled into fists. "I...do I? I don'tknow... I don't...I don't think I know what it is. Love, I mean. Ithink...I think I'm too young to really know."  
Damn. That was exactly the answer that I couldn't really respond to.Not really. "Oh." I paused for a moment, looking away momentarily, thensaid, "I suppose I am, too. Young, I mean."  
"But Asuka-I do care about you, I know that. I promised that I'll bethere for you, and I mean it." He was looking up at me again, calmer,and with clear eyes.  
I could not answer. Only shake my head.  
I'm an absolute idiot.  
No, I'm not. An idiot means someone with an IQ of 25 or lower, I thinkit is. I, on the other hand, have an IQ well above 150, the genius mark.I graduated from college at the age of 14. I'm a supergenius.  
I'm an absolute fool. That's what I am.  
"I'm sorry, Shinji."  
I left the room, giving him no chance to answer me. Just as well-Iwasn't quite sure what I was apologizing for, anyway.  
-How does one fail an EVA synchronization test?  
You don't _fail_ a synch test, you get a score, a percentage. Justlike you get a score on an IQ test. You don't _fail_ an IQ test. And apilot doesn't fail a synch test. That's simply not how it's set up.  
"Synchronization test failed."  
Ridiculous! Only someone who can't synchronize with an EVA could"fail" that test. Someone who's not a pilot, chosen by the MardukReport, or whoever it is.  
"Synchronization test failed."  
A pilot gets a percentage, a rating on the success of the link betweenmind and robot, the completeness of the bond.  
"Synchronization test failed."  
Ritsuko's words rang in my head, and tasted like ash on my tongue. Theconnection just never happened-the interface wouldn't budge. Then theytested Unit 02 with Rei. Oddly enough, now that I look back at it, Ihadn't protested allowing the Wonder Girl into my Unit.  
She synchronized just fine.  
I tried again.  
And again.  
Shinji got in. He looked at me funny before he entered the hatch.  
He synchronized just fine.  
I tried again.  
Again, dammit!  
AGAIN!  
And now I was here, lying on a sofa in a lounge near the locker room.LCL dripped out of my hair; I hadn't bothered with a shower-I didn'tfeel like it. The sofa was probably getting ruined.  
I saw Commander Ikari whisper something to Misato before I gave up.She frowned, then she looked at me. I saw...  
Did I tell you I was scared, too?  
My purpose, my role here was not to pilot EVA, as SubcommanderFuyutsuki said, but to defeat Angels. But if I can't pilot EVA, then Ican't defeat Angels. I was useless. I bet that was what the Commanderwhispered to Misato...  
I heard footsteps. Him, of course. I raised my head. "Don't say it,Shinji. Whatever it is, don't say it."  
He didn't say anything. But he did look at me.  
I looked away, at the lights, at the plants in the room, at anythingelse. My eyes settled on the clock. Just after three in the afternoon.Long day ahead.  
I blinked. Just-an eyeblink. One moment.  
Half past three? What?  
Now I was aware of Ritsuko shaking me. When did she come in? And whywas Shinji...aw, crying again. The wimp.  
I shook that off, quickly, and sat up. "What's going on?"  
Shinji got a hold of himself, taking a few deep breaths. "I...I letyou alone for fifteen minutes or something. Then I went over to you,tried to get you up. You weren't moving. Not even blinking, justbreathing. God, Asuka, you scared me!" He reached out to hold myshoulder. His fingers trembled slightly.  
I didn't shrug him off...but neither did I outwardly acknowledge histouch. I had other things on my mind.  
"What? But I-it was just... What's going on?"  
Ritsuko looked over at Shinji, then back at me. "We'll find out. Comeon. Let's visit the infirmary."  
Scared wasn't even the word for this...  
As she led me out of the room, I found myself actually seeking outShinji, instinctively, looking for reassurance...but I caught only aglimpse of deep, dark blue before I was swept through the doorway andaround the corner. But what I saw spoke volumes to me, in that moment.That's when I knew I had finally lost.  
-I sat in the bed, trying to keep this ridiculous, blue-speckledhospital gown closed around me. I was waiting-knock knock* "Asuka?"  
-for that. I knew he would be coming.  
"Yeah."  
The door creaked open cautiously. He had become an irritating mix ofold and new: ever so careful, tongue poised to apologize, shrinkingaway, tiptoeing everwhere...while, at times, coming forward, showing aglint of steel on his own. I couldn't predict him anymore-not at all.  
"Um, can I-"  
"Yes, you can come in," I said, slightly exasperated. He was currentlyin his spineless form. I was tempted to snicker. The door opened wider,and he stepped in. Seeing the way I had my sheets wrapped around me, hequickly dropped his gaze. "They don't know anything for sure yet," Ianswered pre-emptively, "but it's..."  
"It's related to _that_." I blinked at the vehemence in his voice.  
"Yeah."  
"Dammit," he snarled, clenching a fist and jerking his head up to faceme, "I don't care what my father says, I'm going to get Unit One out ofthat freeze!"  
This time, I caught and held his gaze, unflinchingly. I had to; aftergiving so much ground before, I couldn't look away. He didn't faltereither.  
God help the commander if he refuses to release Unit One.  
"And why do you say that?" I asked softly. "Why do you want Unit Oneout?"  
His fierce countenance slipped into one of puzzlement. "What?"  
"You want to fight? Why?"  
He almost became embarassed, I think. There was a slight flush to hischeeks suddenly, and I expected him to slip into his wimp mode.  
I should have known better. Hadn't I just said that I couldn't predicthim anymore?  
He relaxed his face, as well as his fist, and spoke. "Because, if Ihad been out there before, I could have protected you. Just like I saidI would. And I want to make sure I can continue to do that. Protectyou."  
"Even though it seems like I can't pilot, anymore?"  
"And what does that have to do with anything?" He stepped closer, nothesitantly, but not quite firmly, either.  
"If I can't pilot, then why-"  
"I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT!" His explosion sent me reeling back in mybed. Though I realized he was changing, I hadn't expected that; all Icould do was stare back at him with wide eyes. He continued in a softervoice, but not any less intense.  
"Haven't I told you? Haven't I _TOLD_you?! You're important to me. I care about you!" He edged closer to mewith every word, every word seething with furious conviction, every wordloud and clear.  
"I don't know what exactly it all means, whether it'slove or something, but I won't let anything happen, not to you." Hefinished with a whisper that spoke louder than most screams I had everheard.  
I suddenly realized that his face was less than a quarter meter frommy own face; he was now leaning over the bed, hands propped on themattress-but all I could really see were his eyes. I could get lost inthem, if I wasn't careful.  
Careful. Care. What was that?  
Words.  
Were they just words? Were they _not_ just words?  
They were words, certainly. And they had power. And they had meaning.Certainly.  
I reached out and touched his cheek, gently, feeling the slightlyrough lines of his face. Instantly, as before, the intensity drainedfrom his features. "Asuka?"  
"I still can't understand, but...thank you."  
"Asuka..."  
I finally looked away, feeling exhausted...and oddly calm. "Shinji," Ispoke.  
"Yes?"  
I...care, too. "Hold my hand."  
There was a moment-just a moment of hesitation. Slowly, he slid hishand over mine, on the bed. I lifted my hand up, twining my fingersbetween his, and squeezed gently. He reached over with his left hand,and lifted my chin up, so that he could look into my eyes. I felt noimpulse to look away, not the slightest bit.  
Maybe I didn't understand now, not Misato, and particularly not him.But...I wanted to.  
And ever so slowly, he drew me...no, we drew each other closer,meeting in a gentle embrace. He held me. I held him. I felt, more thanheard, his sigh of relief-and contentment. I closed my eyes, and leanedmy head against his.  
This was...comfortable.  
Yes, comfortable.  
End.  
-Think "In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel. Yes?  
What, you expected them to be all mushy with each other right away?Love is not easy, and in a world like theirs, it's even harder. Asuka'snot out of it yet, either; that mind-rape was a terrible, terrible thingthat will take more than just a day or two to get over.  
About Misato-the Shinji-Misato relationship has been talked plentyabout in the past (guardian, mother, big sister...), but what of Asukaand Misato? They're living together, too. They know each other, theyknow _about_ each other. I'd like to think that there's a bond betweenthem, as well.Will there be more of these? I'd like to do more-as indicated by theabove, I think there's a lot to explore with Misato. I'll see if I cando it. Until then...thank you.
