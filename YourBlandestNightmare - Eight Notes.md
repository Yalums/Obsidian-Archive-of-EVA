"Good morning, Ikari." “早上好，碇。”

She sat next to him and asked what they were playing. He told her the name of the piece.  
她坐在他旁边，问他们在演奏什么。他告诉她曲目的名字。

"Cello is nice, isn't it? You only need to play arpeggio."  
大提琴很不错，对吧？你只需要演奏琶音。

He didn't nod, even though he agreed. He just waited for her to tune her violin with a Bach piece. Then he pulled the bow across the strings of his instrument. The eight notes echoed melodiously in the auditorium.  
尽管他同意，但他没有点头。他只是等待她用巴赫的作品调好小提琴。随后，他拉动弓弦，乐器上的八度音符在礼堂中悠扬回响。

D. A. B. F-sharp. G. D. G. A.

D. A. B. F-sharp. G. D. G. A.

As Asuka joined, and her violin sang many new notes, Shinji remained in those eight. It was his job, the cello's job. A loop to be repeated until the end of the piece. He would remain in the background, providing a basis from where the other instruments could jump and soar, captivating the audience while he stayed in the shadows, doing a good job.  
随着明日香加入，她的提琴奏出许多新音符，真嗣仍停留在那八个音符上。这是他的职责，大提琴的职责。一个要重复到曲终的循环。他将留在背景中，为其他乐器提供跳跃和翱翔的基础，吸引着观众，而他则留在阴影中，默默做好自己的工作。

Asuka was right. It was nice. Something simple and quiet that he could do, and still receive an applause at the end. Sort of like washing the dishes or doing the laundry. He was fine with it.  
明日香说得没错。这感觉很好。一件简单而宁静的事情，他可以去做，并且结束后还能得到掌声。有点像洗碗或洗衣服。他对此感到满意。

The violin stopped. Shinji saw that Asuka was now holding a cello, just like him.  
小提琴声停了。真嗣看到明日香现在正拿着一把大提琴，就像他一样。

"Only arpeggio," she said, getting her bow close to the strings. "Must be great. Mind if I try?"  
“只弹琶音，”她说着，将弓靠近琴弦。“一定很棒。介意我试试吗？”

"No."

"We can be a cello duo."  
"我们可以组成一个大提琴二重奏。"

"Sure." "当然。"

They began again, now at the same time. D. A. B. F-sharp. G. D. G. A. That was all they had to do, and all they did, over and over. Shinji didn't even bother to count the seconds or the minutes, he just went with it. However, his ears protested, something was wrong. His heart ached, something was missing.  
他们再次开始，这次同时进行。D. A. B. F-sharp. G. D. G. A. 这就是他们需要做的，也是他们反复做的。真嗣甚至没有费心去计算秒数或分钟数，他只是顺其自然。然而，他的耳朵抗议，有什么不对劲。他的心感到疼痛，有什么东西缺失了。

His soul was still waiting for the other melodies to begin and fly high, but they never arrived, and never would. Only the basis, the eight notes. Forever.  
他的灵魂仍在等待其他旋律开始并高高飞翔，但它们从未到来，也永远不会到来。只有基础，那八个音符。永远如此。

Shinji stopped and sighed.  
真嗣停下脚步，叹了口气。

"It is nice," Asuka repeated. "Calm. Easy to do, no risks. I like it."  
"这很好，"明日香重复道，"平静。容易做到，没有风险。我喜欢这样。"

Shinji put his instrument down, with care, the bow resting across the strings. He should have known. Asuka never called him Ikari.  
真嗣小心翼翼地放下乐器，弓横放在弦上。他早该明白，明日香从不会叫他碇。

"You are not her." 你不是她。

He didn't bother to look as she dissolved into sand and dust. His own chair shared the same fate when he stood up. Shinji began to look around, in the vast, dark and seemingly empty auditorium.  
他没有费心去看她化作沙尘消散的场景。当他站起来时，自己的椅子也遭遇了同样的命运。真嗣开始环顾四周，在这广阔、黑暗且看似空无一人的礼堂中。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

He walked around, without aim, calling her name and receiving only his own echo. The curtains leading to the scenario were always so far away, no matter how much he moved towards them. Sleeping spotlights looked down at him.  
他四处徘徊，漫无目的，呼唤着她的名字，却只听到自己的回声。通往场景的帷幕总是那么遥远，无论他如何努力靠近。昏暗的聚光灯俯视着他。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

As if finally answering to his call, a new melody began to float around him. Two violins, playing their respective parts of the Canon in D, perfectly synchronized, yet still missing something.  
仿佛终于回应了他的呼唤，一段新的旋律开始在他周围飘荡。两把小提琴，各自演奏着 D 大调卡农的旋律，完美同步，却仍感觉缺少了些什么。

He saw himself sitting on a chair under a column of light, Asuka next to him, violins on both their shoulders. Their eyes were closed, their movements flawless and elegant.  
他看到自己坐在一束光下的椅子上，明日香坐在旁边，两人肩上都架着小提琴。他们的眼睛闭着，动作流畅而优雅。

"No. Not her. Not me."  
"不，不是她。不是我。"

Shinji saw a new himself and a new Asuka, playing violas. And two more, playing second violins. And sharing a harpsichord. And violins again, and other instruments whose names he had never bothered to learn. Never cello, though.  
真嗣看到一个新的自己和新的明日香，正在演奏中提琴。还有另外两人，演奏第二小提琴。他们共用一台大键琴。接着又是小提琴，以及其他他从未费心去了解名称的乐器。但从未有演奏大提琴的场景。

Lost in a labyrinth of reflections, Shinji could not discern which was the real one, if the real one was even there to begin with. The melodies, although incomplete, weren't discordant. There was no lack of coordination between each of his copies and their Asukas, not even a little.  
迷失在镜像迷宫中，真嗣无法分辨哪个是真实的，甚至怀疑真实本身是否存在。旋律虽未完整，却不显杂乱。他与各自的明日香之间，协调无间，丝毫不差。

He wondered if she would be happier that way, with a Shinji that didn't settle for eight lousy notes in the background.  
他思索着，如果她拥有一个不甘于在背景中只留下八个糟糕音符的真嗣，是否会感到更幸福。

But, as he was about to turn around and walk into the darkness of the auditorium; his ears twitched. One of the many melodies in the air was different than the rest. A violin, he noticed, keeping with the tempo and playing the notes to perfection, just like the rest… and yet it sounded angry.  
然而，正当他准备转身步入礼堂的黑暗中时，他的耳朵微微一动。空气中众多旋律中的一支与众不同。他注意到，那是一把小提琴，它紧跟节奏，完美无瑕地演奏着每个音符，就像其他乐器一样……但听起来却带着怒气。

Shinji followed that music. He could feel a hand grasping the bow with more strength than necessary, and the tension of the shoulder under the violin. He passed all the other mirages, who dissolved into dust as he denied them his attention.  
真嗣追随着那音乐。他能感受到一只手以超出必要的力度紧握着弓，以及小提琴下肩膀的紧绷。他经过所有其他的幻影，它们因他不予理睬而化为尘埃。

The Asuka at the end of the trail of notes had her head low, her eyes hidden by a curtain of red hair, playing her instrument with no apparent issue. She stopped, but didn't look up.  
在音符轨迹的尽头，明日香低垂着头，红色的长发如帘幕般遮住了她的双眼，她毫无问题地演奏着乐器。她停了下来，却没有抬头。

Shinji thought of apologizing, but the words didn't even reach his mouth.  
真嗣本想道歉，但话到嘴边却说不出口。

Next to Asuka, the other Shinji and his violin became sand, leaving the chair empty. He stared at it, wondering if it was an invitation, and if he deserved to take it. Scared of what would happen if he did, scared of what would happen if he didn't.  
在明日香旁边，另一个真嗣和他的小提琴化为了沙粒，留下空荡荡的椅子。他凝视着它，思索这是否是一种邀请，以及自己是否有资格坐上去。他害怕如果坐上去会发生什么，也害怕如果不坐上去会发生什么。

So many things he wanted to say, to cry, to scream, at her and with her; yet he couldn't break the silence of that auditorium.  
他有那么多话想对她说，想与她一起哭泣，一起尖叫；然而，他却无法打破那礼堂中的沉默。

The chair was still empty.  
椅子依旧空着。

Shinji sat down, not without his doubts. A cello appeared on his arms. Asuka put her violin on her shoulder again, bow across the strings; but she didn't play.  
真嗣坐了下来，心中不无疑虑。一把大提琴出现在他的臂弯中。明日香再次将小提琴架在肩上，弓横于弦上；但她并未演奏。

Her waiting brought back memories of a kiss, of a wall in the night.  
她的等待唤起了关于一个吻、关于夜晚一堵墙的回忆。

D. Shinji's hand moved almost on his own.  
D. 真嗣的手几乎是不由自主地动了起来。

A. An unsure note. A. 一个不确定的音符。

B. The bow trembled a little.  
B. 弓微微颤抖了一下。

F-sharp. Shinji took a deep breath.  
F#调。真嗣深吸了一口气。

G. Not running away. 没有逃跑。

D. Faster D. 更快

G. But not too fast.  
G. 但不要太快。

A. This time, he would…  
这一次，他将会……

Asuka accompanied him, weaving the complementary melody. Now it was much easier to sense the anger in her notes. She played with ferocity, almost as if she wanted to drown and silence Shinji's music with her own. He endured each attack, keeping to the loop of eight notes, but this time there was no safety, no calm. She wouldn't let him stay in the shadows, and he took the challenge.  
明日香陪伴着他，编织出相辅相成的旋律。此刻，她的音符中愤怒之情更易察觉。她以狂暴之势演奏，仿佛要用自己的音乐淹没并消音真嗣的旋律。他承受着每一次攻击，坚守在那八音循环之中，但这次已无安全可言，亦无宁静之地。她不容他躲藏于阴影，而他接受了挑战。

When her violin roared, his cello stood firm. His melody carried his shield, but also his apology, and better than any word could. He took her anger, accepting his part in it.  
当她的提琴咆哮时，他的大提琴屹立不倒。他的旋律携带着他的盾牌，也承载着他的歉意，胜过任何言语。他接纳了她的怒火，承认了自己的责任。

But Asuka's fury was soon spent, leaving only the pain. Her music became like a wail, the expression of a soul who had been hurt long ago, and only now was allowed to let it all out. He saw tears rolling down her cheeks, and she biting her lip to not whimper or cry. Shinji and his cello took that, too. He played his eight notes like an embrace in the night, like a hand stretching down into the abyss to pull her up.  
然而，明日香的怒火很快便消散了，留下的只有痛苦。她的音乐变得如同哀嚎，是一个很久以前就受伤的灵魂，直到此刻才被允许尽情宣泄。他看见泪水顺着她的脸颊滑落，她紧咬着嘴唇，不让自己发出呜咽或哭泣。真嗣和他的大提琴也承受了这一切。他演奏的八个音符宛如夜色中的拥抱，如同一只手伸入深渊，要将她拉起。

Like a boy brave enough to break a quarantine zone in a roof.  
如同一个勇敢的男孩，敢于打破屋顶上的隔离区。

And when there were no more tears in her eyes, when the sadness of her violin faded like a mournful whisper, when Shinji's tired hand missed a chord and his tempo was about to break; Asuka's melody grabbed him by the shoulders and pulled him back up. Her notes were now a caress encouraging him to continue, an honest applause in a green dress. Shinji could see her eyes, no longer hiding her hair.  
当她眼中再无泪水，当她的小提琴悲伤如哀婉低语般消散，当真嗣疲惫的手错失和弦，节奏即将崩溃之际；明日香的旋律紧紧抓住他的肩膀，将他拉回正轨。她的音符此刻化作温柔的抚慰，激励他继续前行，宛如身着绿裙的真挚掌声。真嗣能看见她的双眼，不再被发丝遮掩。

They invited him to complete the piece.  
他们邀请他完成这部作品。

Thus, violin and cello sang of loss, of pain, of hope, of healing. The strings begged for forgiveness, and the bows granted it. Shinji's eight notes rose high, carried by Asuka's melody to the place they had been denying themselves for a long time.  
于是，小提琴与大提琴吟唱着失落、痛苦、希望与治愈。琴弦恳求宽恕，弓弦则予以恩赐。真嗣的八个音符高扬，乘着明日香的旋律，抵达了他们长久以来自我否定的所在。

Beyond the walls of the auditorium, a goddess killed herself, a black moon exploded, and the red seas receded.  
礼堂之外，女神自尽，黑月炸裂，红海退潮。

_**End.**_
