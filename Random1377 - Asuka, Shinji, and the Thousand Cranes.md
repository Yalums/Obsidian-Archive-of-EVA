"I hate you!" “我恨你！”

Asuka Langley Souryu opened the door to the small apartment she shared with Shinji Ikari and Misato Katsuragi, frowning as the hateful words she herself had spoken two days prior echoed from the living room.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷推开了她与碇真嗣和葛城美里同住的小公寓的门，眉头紧皱，两天前她自己说出的那些刻薄话语从客厅回荡而来。

"I don't care!" came the response, accompanied by a swell of music, "I still love you! And I'll go on loving you until the end of time!"  
“我不在乎！”回应声伴随着音乐的涌动响起，“我依然爱你！我会一直爱着你，直到时间的尽头！”

"What the hell are you watching?" Asuka asked as she came into the dwelling, "Daytime soaps or something?"  
“你到底在看什么鬼东西？”明日香走进屋内问道，“白天的肥皂剧还是什么？”

"Huh?" Shinji looked over his shoulder, briefly meeting her eyes before looking quickly away, "I wasn't really watching it," he said quietly, "just… had it on."  
"啊？" 真嗣回头看了一眼，与她的目光短暂交汇后迅速移开，"我没怎么在看，"他轻声说道，"只是……开着而已。"

The redhead's frown deepened as the female lead on the television cried that she didn't REALLY hate the male lead, and begged his forgiveness. "Turn this crap off," she muttered, snatching the remote off the arm of the couch and jabbing the 'off' button with her thumb.  
红发女孩的眉头皱得更深了，电视上的女主角哭喊着说她并不真的恨男主角，并恳求他的原谅。"把这垃圾关掉，"她低声抱怨，从沙发扶手上抓过遥控器，用拇指猛戳关机键。

Shinji stared down into his lap, seemingly afraid of antagonizing the girl any further.  
真嗣低头盯着膝盖，似乎害怕进一步激怒女孩。

It had been a very awkward couple of days. Asuka had come home after a scant few hours in the hospital for observation, but she had been angry and reclusive – as if being saved by the First Child, Rei Ayanami, had been some sort of cruel joke, carried out by everyone she knew.  
那几天真是尴尬至极。明日香在医院只待了短短几个小时就回家了，但她既愤怒又孤僻——仿佛被第一适格者绫波零救了一命，是所有人对她开的一个残忍玩笑。

Misato had recommended that Shinji simply give her space, but in an apartment as small as theirs, this was easier said than done. He was constantly running into her (sometimes literally) no matter how hard he tried to avoid her. He couldn't just wander the streets of Tokyo-3, nor could he go to his friend Kensuke Aida's house, as he was out of town.  
美里建议真嗣干脆给她点空间，但在他们那狭小的公寓里，说起来容易做起来难。无论他多么努力地避开她，总是会不经意间撞见她（有时甚至是字面意义上的）。他不能只是在第三新东京市的街头游荡，也不能去朋友相田剑介家，因为他不在城里。

In short, he was trapped.  
简而言之，他被困住了。

"Going to my room," Asuka muttered into the silence, "tired." She stepped past the couch, taking one final look at the boy, and coming to a stop. "What is that?" she asked.  
"回我房间了，" 明日香在沉默中喃喃自语，"累了。" 她从沙发旁走过，最后看了一眼那个男孩，停下了脚步。"那是什么？" 她问道。

Shinji blinked, looking up at her, then back down to his lap. "Oh," he replied, "it's a crane." He held the piece of folded paper up so she could get a better look, gripping it by the tail and breast and pulling slightly, making the wings flap. "See?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，抬头看着她，然后又低头看向自己的膝盖。"哦，" 他回答，"这是一只纸鹤。" 他将折好的纸片举起，让她能更清楚地看到，捏住尾巴和胸部轻轻拉动，使翅膀扇动。"看到了吗？"

"Why do you have so many of them?"  
"你为什么有这么多？"

"Just something I heard," the boy shrugged uneasily, "from Sasaki, in class."  
"只是我听来的，" 男孩不安地耸了耸肩，"在课堂上，从佐佐木那里。"

"Sadeko?" Asuka frowned, "The little girl that always sits in the corner on the other side of Wondergirl?"  
"Sadeko？" 明日香皱眉，"那个总是坐在角落里，和 Wondergirl 相对的小女孩？"

"Uh huh," Shinji nodded, "that's her. She said there's an old legend that if you make a thousand cranes, the gods will grant you one wish."  
"嗯嗯，" 真嗣点头，"就是她。她说有个古老的传说，如果你折一千只纸鹤，神明就会实现你一个愿望。"

"And you're gonna make them?" Asuka asked, shaking her head and turning for her room, "What an idiot."  
"你打算做那些吗？" 明日香问道，摇着头转身回自己的房间，"真是个白痴。"

"Well," the Third Child said quietly, looking down as she walked away, "I wasn't going to make a thousand… just a few."  
"嗯，" 第三适格者轻声说道，边走边低头，"我没打算做一千个……只是几个而已。"

When he looked up, Asuka was closing the door to her room.  
当他抬头时，明日香正关上她房间的门。

He sighed and put the crane to the side, then picked up the remote and turned the TV back on, almost entirely forgetting the incident by dinnertime.  
他叹了口气，把纸鹤放到一边，然后拿起遥控器重新打开了电视，几乎到晚饭时间就完全忘记了这件事。

Of course, he was reminded several days later.  
当然，几天后他又被提醒了。

###

"Wake up!" “起床！”

Shinji mumbled tiredly and tried to roll over from his side to his stomach, but he found that he could not, as there was a restraining hand on his shoulder – and it was shaking him.  
真嗣疲惫地咕哝着，试图从侧躺翻到俯卧，但他发现自己做不到，因为有一只手按在他的肩膀上——而且还在摇晃他。

"Wake up, you idiot!"  
“醒醒，你这个笨蛋！”

With a groan, the boy rolled onto his back and sat up, his eyes staying closed as he yawned, "Asu… ka? Is that you?"  
男孩呻吟一声，翻过身坐了起来，眼睛依旧闭着，打着哈欠问道：“明日香？是你吗？”

"Who else would it be, dipstick??" came the angry reply, "Now wake UP!"  
“还能是谁，傻瓜？”愤怒的回答传来，“现在快醒醒！”

Rubbing his eyes, Shinji yawned again. "What time is it?"  
揉着眼睛，真嗣又打了个哈欠。“几点了？”

"Two," Asuka answered, her voice conveying her frustration at his lack of cooperation, "now would you wake the hell up, or do I need to get a bucket of water?"  
“两点，”明日香回答，她的声音透露出对他不合作的恼怒，“你是要自己醒过来，还是我得去拿桶水来？”

"Two?" Shinji echoed, finally opening his eyes and blinking in the dark of his room, "What's wrong? Is there another angel?"  
"两个？" 真嗣重复道，终于睁开眼睛，在黑暗的房间中眨了眨眼，"怎么了？还有另一个使徒吗？"

This was just about the only reason he could think of that Asuka would be in his room at that hour. That, or perhaps the apartment was on fire. Had he been more awake, it might have occurred to him that she was actually TALKING to him, rather than muttering one to two syllable words and avoiding him as she had since the day she had talked to him in the living room.  
这是他能想到的唯一理由，为什么明日香会在那个时间点出现在他的房间。要么，也许是公寓着火了。如果他更清醒一点，可能会意识到她实际上是在和他交谈，而不是像自从她在客厅和他谈话那天以来那样，只说一两个音节的单词并避开他。

"Here," Asuka said tersely.  
"给，" 明日香简短地说道。

Shinji simply stared as a small, white shape was thrust in front of his eyes. "What is that?" he asked innocently.  
真嗣只是呆呆地盯着眼前被推过来的一个小小的白色形状。“那是什么？”他天真地问道。

"ARRGGH!!!!" Asuka screamed, making him flinch, "It's a CRANE!!"  
“啊啊啊！！！”明日香尖叫起来，让他吓了一跳，“那是纸鹤！！”

"Oh," Shinji answered, shrinking back against his wall, "sorry."  
“哦，”真嗣回答，缩回到墙边，“对不起。”

"Stupid things!" the redhead raged, crushing the misshapen crane in her fist, "Stupid, stupid things! Tell me how to make them right!"  
"愚蠢的东西！" 红发女孩愤怒地吼道，将手中变形了的纸鹤捏碎，"愚蠢，愚蠢的东西！告诉我怎么才能把它们弄好！"

"They're kinda hard," Shinji said tentatively, "how long have you been trying to-"  
"它们确实有点难，" 真嗣试探性地回答，"你已经尝试了多久——"

"I KNOW THEY'RE HARD!!" Asuka shrieked, her voice dangerously unstable, "I've been trying for a whole damn week!! STUPID, STUPID PIECES OF-"  
"我知道它们难！！" 明日香尖叫着，声音极度不稳定，"我已经试了一个该死的星期了！！愚蠢，愚蠢的破烂——"

"I'll show you how."  
"我来教你。"

Asuka stood still for a minute, shaking and breathing in short, shallow pants. Finally, she calmed, opening her hand and letting the crumpled bit of paper fall to the floor. Without a word of thanks, she turned to his desk and picked up a piece of scratch paper, dropping it on the boy's bed.  
明日香一动不动地站了一会儿，颤抖着，呼吸急促而浅短。最终，她平静下来，张开手，让那张皱巴巴的纸片掉落在地上。她没有道谢，转身走向他的书桌，拿起一张草稿纸，丢在男孩的床上。  

"Can you turn on the light?" Shinji asked cautiously, hoping this simple request wouldn't touch off the volatile redhead, "it would be easier to show you that way."  
"你能开灯吗？" 真嗣小心翼翼地问，希望这个简单的请求不会触怒那位易怒的红发女孩，"那样会更容易教你。"

Asuka frowned at him for a minute, as if trying to decide if he was toying with her somehow, then turned and stepped over to the switch on the wall, flipping it on.  
明日香皱着眉头盯着他，似乎在判断他是否在以某种方式戏弄她，然后转身走到墙上的开关旁，将其打开。

"Thanks," Shinji said, squinting in the suddenly bright light of the overhead. "Now, the first thing you want to do is make a square."  
“谢谢，”真嗣说道，眯起眼睛适应着头顶突然亮起的光线。“现在，你要做的第一件事是折出一个正方形。”

"I know that," Asuka muttered, watching as the boy carefully folded the paper so that it was a square with a small bit of extra along one side. "I'm not stupid, you know!"  
“我知道，”明日香咕哝着，看着男孩小心翼翼地将纸折叠成一个正方形，一侧留出一点多余的部分。“我可不傻，你知道的！”

Shinji blushed and nodded. "I know you're not, but the one you showed me wasn't made out of a perfect square, and-"  
真嗣脸红了，点点头。“我知道你不是故意的，但你给我看的那张并不是用一个完美的正方形剪出来的，而且——”

"Oh, so you're so perfect and I'm just a moron, right??" the redhead snapped, her face flushing.  
“哦，所以你这么完美，而我就是个白痴，对吧？”红发女孩厉声说道，脸涨得通红。

"No, no!" Shinji said quickly, reaching awkwardly over to his desk and picking up his scissors, "It's just that you have to make sure that this little extra piece of paper is all the way off. It's easier to cut it than tear it."  
“不，不！”真嗣急忙说道，笨拙地伸手去拿桌上的剪刀，“只是你要确保这个小纸片完全剪掉。剪掉比撕掉更容易。”

"Thank you, mister obvious," Asuka said sarcastically, watching him start to fold, "You start with a diagonal fold?" she asked, frowning, "Why not lengthways?"  
"谢谢你，明显的先生，" 明日香讽刺地说道，看着他开始折叠，"你从对角线开始折？" 她皱着眉头问，"为什么不顺着长度折呢？"

Shinji hesitated, considering his words carefully.  
真嗣犹豫了一下，仔细斟酌着言辞。

It wasn't exactly the easiest time for him, either. He had been forced to sit still as Asuka's mind was violated by the angel, lacking even the ability to comfort her with words. Add to this the fact that he had heard his guardian, Misato Katsuragi, sobbing in the living room less than three weeks prior – and had felt too immature to comfort her – and it was soon clear that he was not the invincible savior Asuka was always calling him.  
对他来说，这也不是最轻松的时刻。他被迫坐着不动，眼看着明日香的心灵被天使侵犯，连用言语安慰她的能力都没有。再加上三周前他听到监护人葛城美里在客厅里哭泣——而他觉得自己太不成熟，无法安慰她——这一切很快表明，他并不是明日香一直称呼的无所不能的救世主。

"It's a little easier," he said finally, "that way, when you make the long fold, the paper just kind of folds itself." He held the paper up. "See?"  
"这样会稍微容易些，" 他最后说道，"当你做那个长折叠时，纸张就像是自己在折叠一样。" 他举起纸张。"看到了吗？"

"Hmmmm," Asuka hummed, watching closely until he was done folding. "I'm going to take a shower and go back to bed."  
"嗯……" 明日香哼了一声，仔细观察直到他完成折叠。"我要去洗个澡，然后回床上睡觉。"

"Want this?" Shinji offered softly, holding out the crane, "You can have it if-"  
"想要这个吗？" 真嗣轻声问道，递出纸鹤，"如果你想要的话，可以拿去……"

"I don't need your pity," the redhead muttered, turning for the door, "goodnight."  
"我不需要你的怜悯，"红发人低声说着，转身向门口走去，"晚安。"

"Goodnight," the Third Child sighed, letting his hand fall back to the bed.  
"晚安，"第三适格者叹了口气，把手放回床上。"

He considered the crane for a moment longer, then yawned tiredly, got out of bed, and turned off the light. As he slid back under his covers, he couldn't help but smile slightly.  
他又多看了那只纸鹤一会儿，然后疲倦地打了个哈欠，下床关了灯。当他滑回被窝时，忍不住微微一笑。

Even though she hadn't said thank you, Asuka still needed his help for something.  
尽管她没有说谢谢，但明日香仍然需要他的帮助。

**"Even if it's something small,"** he thought as he closed his eyes, **"it's nice to be needed."**  
“即使是很小的事情，”他闭上眼睛想，“被人需要的感觉真好。”

###

Another week passed, during which time Asuka spent much of her free time folding paper cranes in her room.  
又一周过去了，期间明日香大部分空闲时间都在房间里折纸鹤。

'I'm not making a thousand,' she had told Shinji one afternoon, 'I'm just bored, that's all! You and Misato are so boring, I HAVE to find something else to do besides talk to you!'  
“我才不做一千个呢，”一天下午她对真嗣说，“我只是无聊罢了，就是这样！你和美里都太无聊了，我除了跟你们说话，总得找点别的事做！”

As for Shinji, he found that his days were lackadaisical, lacking any true focus or direction. He went to school and did his work, but it was halfhearted at best, since he was always thinking about the EVAs, the angels, his roommates, his estranged father, or his injured friend, Touji Suzuhara. Indeed, it's a wonder he was able to focus on any one topic for more than a moment or two without being mentally redirected – usually in a darker direction. Coming home wasn't too much better, as Misato was always at work, on her way to work, or taking a nap.  
至于真嗣，他发现自己日子过得懒散，缺乏真正的目标或方向。他去上学，做作业，但最多也只是敷衍了事，因为他总是在想着 EVA、使徒、室友、疏远的父亲，或是受伤的朋友铃原东治。确实，他能在任何一个话题上集中注意力超过一两个瞬间而不被思绪带偏——通常是往更阴暗的方向——已经是个奇迹了。回到家也没好到哪儿去，因为美里总是在工作，去工作的路上，或者在打盹。

One advantage home had over the rest of the world, however, was the cranes.  
然而，家有一个胜过世界其他地方的优势，那就是那些起重机。

Shinji found that more and more he was savoring the time spent watching Asuka quietly folding the small birds in her room. They would come home in silence, do some homework, and make sure the house was clean. Then Shinji would cook some dinner, always making sure to cook enough for Misato in case she was hungry when she got home, and Asuka would take a shower. After this, Asuka would go to her room and fold cranes for twenty or thirty minutes, and Shinji would wander from room to room until finally coming to a stop at her open door and watching her.  
真嗣发现，自己越来越享受在房间里静静地看明日香折小纸鸟的时光。他们回家时总是沉默不语，做些作业，确保房子干净整洁。然后真嗣会做晚饭，总是确保做得足够多，以防美里回家时饿了，而明日香则会去洗澡。洗完澡后，明日香会回到自己的房间，折上二三十分钟的纸鹤，真嗣则在各个房间里闲逛，最后停在她的敞开的门口，看着她。

Asuka didn't seem to mind his intrusion, or kept her irritation to herself if she DID mind, and would even talk to him from time to time… though mostly she stayed silent, cutting and folding with a look of intense concentration on her face.  
明日香似乎并不介意他的打扰，如果她真的介意，也把不悦藏在心里，有时甚至会和他聊上几句……不过大多数时候她都保持沉默，剪裁折叠时脸上带着专注的表情。

It was this look that gave Shinji an idea.  
正是这种表情给了真嗣一个灵感。

"Where are you going?" Asuka asked as he slipped on his shoes one Friday evening after dinner, "I thought you had a paper due on Monday?"  
"你要去哪儿？" 周五晚饭后，真嗣穿上鞋子时，明日香问道，"我记得你周一要交论文的？"

"I'll be right back," Shinji replied, a slight note of excitement in his tone, "it'll only be a few minutes."  
"我马上就回来，" 真嗣回答，语气中带着一丝兴奋，"只需要几分钟。"

"Whatever," the redhead murmured, "I'll be in my room." She headed that way as the Third Child left, frowning slightly as the door opened and closed. "Figures he'd run out," she muttered angrily, "leave me all alone in this stupid place."  
"随便吧，" 红发少女低声咕哝，"我去房间了。" 她朝那个方向走去，当第三适格者离开时，她微微皱眉，门开了又关。"他果然跑出去了，" 她生气地嘀咕，"把我一个人留在这个破地方。"

As she sat down and started making cranes, thoughts of the brown-haired boy's departure were pushed away in favor of attention to detail and careful folding. She was proud of how much better she had gotten, though she would never say this out loud. Why should a simple pastime like this please her?  
当她坐下开始折纸鹤时，棕发男孩离去的念头被抛诸脑后，取而代之的是对细节的关注和小心翼翼的折叠。她为自己进步了多少而感到自豪，尽管她绝不会大声说出来。为什么这样简单的消遣会让她感到高兴呢？

"Not like any of this means anything," she whispered, "just making cranes." When Shinji came home ten minutes later, she looked up. "Where were you?" she asked quietly, getting to her feet and frowning as he beamed at her, his hands concealed behind him.  
“好像这些都没什么意义，”她低声自语，“只是在折纸鹤。”十分钟后，当真嗣回到家时，她抬头望去。“你去哪儿了？”她轻声问道，站起身来，皱着眉头看他向她露出笑容，双手藏在背后。

"Here," the boy said, bringing his hands out from behind his back, "I thought this would make it easier."  
“给，”男孩说着，将手从背后拿出来，“我想这会让事情变得简单些。”

Asuka blinked as Shinji pulled a small package out of a plastic bag. "Paper?" she asked, confused.  
明日香眨了眨眼，看着真嗣从塑料袋里掏出一个小包裹。“纸？”她疑惑地问。

"Origami paper," Shinji corrected, smiling happily, "they're already perfect squares, and all different colors." He handed her the bag, "I thought you might be getting tired of all that cutting – and all that white."  
“折纸用的纸，”真嗣纠正道，开心地笑着，“它们已经是完美的正方形了，而且颜色各异。”他把袋子递给她，“我想你可能已经厌倦了所有的剪切——还有那些白色。”

Asuka took the bag, considering the images, a frog, a peacock, and a crane (ironically enough) in silence. "Ummm, thanks," she said after a moment. When Shinji smiled and nodded, turning to leave, she said, "Hey, I'm gonna take a shower. When I get out, you wanna help me fold some?"  
明日香接过袋子，默默地看着里面的图案，一只青蛙、一只孔雀和一只鹤（讽刺的是）。“嗯，谢谢，”她过了一会儿说道。当真嗣微笑点头，转身要走时，她说：“嘿，我要去洗个澡。等我出来，你想帮我一起折吗？”

Shinji turned back to her, his face a study in confusion. "S-sure," he said, trying to hide his amazement, "that would be… ok."  
真嗣转回身面对她，脸上满是困惑。“好、好的，”他试图掩饰自己的惊讶，“那会……没问题。”

"I don't NEED your help," Asuka said suddenly, "it's just too damn quiet in here."  
“我不需要你的帮助，”明日香突然说道，“只是这里太他妈安静了。”

"Ok," Shinji said softly, his face falling a bit. He forced a smile. "Besides," he said with a shrug, "I don't think I COULD help you." When she looked confused, he added, "I think the legend says you have to make them all yourself. I'll have to ask Sasaki for sure."  
“好吧，”真嗣轻声说，脸上略显失落。他强挤出一个微笑。“再说，”他耸耸肩，“我觉得我帮不上你。”见她一脸困惑，他又补充道，“传说里说你得自己动手做。我得去问问佐佐木确认一下。”

"I'm not doing it because of that!" Asuka scowled, "I'm just killing some time! I don't believe in stupid stuff like that."  
"我不是因为那个才做的！" 明日香皱眉道，"我只是打发时间！我才不信那些愚蠢的东西。"

Shinji nodded quickly, taking a step back at her vehemence. "Ok!" he said nervously, raising his hands, "I'll still come fold with you, if you want me to."  
真嗣连忙点头，被她的激烈反应吓得后退一步。"好的！"他紧张地说，举起双手，"如果你愿意，我还是会来和你一起折纸的。"

"Didn't I just say it was too quiet?" Asuka asked, her face darkening, "I said-" she cut herself off, "I'm taking a shower, come back when I'm done – or not, I don't really care."  
"我不是刚说过太安静了吗？" 明日香问道，脸色阴沉下来，"我说——"她突然打住，"我要去洗澡了，等我洗完再回来——或者不回来，我其实无所谓。"

"Alright." "好的。"

When Asuka came out of the bathroom, drying her hair and frowning slightly, Shinji was sitting on the floor in her room, reading the small insert that came with the paper.  
当明日香从浴室出来，一边擦着头发一边微微皱眉时，真嗣正坐在她房间的地板上，阅读着随报纸附赠的小折纸说明。

"It says cranes are only a medium skill level fold," he said, smiling up at her as she tossed the towel to the side, "I'd hate to see a hard one."  
“上面说折鹤只是中等难度的折纸，”他笑着抬头看她，明日香将毛巾扔到一旁，“我真想看看难的会是什么样。”

"Uh huh," Asuka murmured, taking the paper from him and looking it over, "which side should I start folding first?" she asked, turning it over, "The colored side or the white side?"  
“嗯哼，”明日香轻声应道，从他手中接过纸张仔细查看，“我应该从哪一面开始折呢？”她翻转着纸张问道，“是有颜色的那一面还是白色那一面？”

"The white side," Shinji answered, "that way the colored side doesn't get as creased."  
"白色那面，" 真嗣回答，"这样彩色那面就不会皱得太厉害。"

"Ok," the redhead answered, making the first fold.  
"好的，" 红发女孩应道，开始第一次折叠。"

"Oh," Shinji added, snapping his fingers, "and I called Sasaki. She told me that the legend says something like, 'You must lay your hand upon each crane,' so as long as you touch each one, it should…" he trailed off, not wanting to use the word 'work.'  
"哦，" 真嗣补充道，打了个响指，"我还给佐佐木打了电话。她说传说里提到，'你必须亲手触摸每一只鹤'，所以只要你触碰每一只，应该就能……" 他没说完，不想用"起作用"这个词。"

It was just a legend after all.  
毕竟那只是一个传说。

Asuka's thoughts were running along the same lines. "Eh," she shrugged, "whatever."  
明日香的思绪也沿着同样的轨迹。“呃，”她耸耸肩，“随便吧。”

Of course, for the remainder of the time they spent folding that afternoon, Asuka made sure she touched every crane Shinji made.  
当然，在那天下午剩下的时间里，明日香确保她碰触了真嗣折的每一只纸鹤。

Just to be sure.  
只是为了确保一下。

###

One week after buying the paper, Shinji sat with Asuka in her room, idly folding cranes. They had done quite a few, but even more were stuffed in the garbage. 'The wings have to work,' Sasaki had told Shinji several days before, 'otherwise they can't fly to the gods and tell them of your wish.'  
在买纸一周后，真嗣和明日香坐在她的房间里，悠闲地折着纸鹤。他们已经折了不少，但更多的被塞进了垃圾桶。'翅膀必须能动，'佐佐木几天前告诉真嗣，'否则它们无法飞到神明那里传达你的愿望。'

Asuka wasn't happy about this, but since she was 'just doing this for fun,' she had not complained very loudly.  
明日香对此并不高兴，但由于她只是'为了好玩才这么做'，所以她并没有大声抱怨。

They didn't speak very much when they were folding, and they never rushed when making them. Neither of them really had any place to be, and there was an unspoken accord between them to make every crane as perfect as possible.  
他们折纸鹤时话不多，制作时也从不匆忙。两人都没有特别要去的地方，彼此间有一种默契，就是要让每一只纸鹤都尽可能完美。

Just to be sure.  
只是为了确保。

"You still don't wonder why we fight?" Shinji asked during an especially quiet minute, glancing at Asuka out of the corner of his eye, "I mean, yeah, we fight to defend ourselves, but don't you ever wonder what the angels want?"  
“你还是不奇怪我们为什么要战斗吗？”真嗣在一个特别安静的时刻问道，用眼角瞥了一眼明日香，“我是说，没错，我们战斗是为了自卫，但你难道从不好奇使徒想要什么吗？”

Asuka paused in her folding, staring off into space. "Yeah," she admitted quietly, shrugging slightly as she resumed, "I do kinda wonder about it sometimes – especially since that time we crawled through those air ducts – but no one's telling us, so why worry about it?" She set aside the crane she was working on, turning to face the boy. "Look," she said firmly, "we can speculate all we want, but until someone says, 'hey, this is why,' we'll just be wasting our time, right?"  
明日香在折叠衣物时停了下来，目光飘向远方。“嗯，”她轻声承认，微微耸肩继续说道，“我有时确实会好奇——尤其是在我们爬过那些通风管道之后——但没人告诉我们，那又何必担心呢？”她把正在做的纸鹤放在一边，转向男孩。“听着，”她坚定地说，“我们可以随意猜测，但除非有人告诉我们，‘嘿，这就是原因’，否则我们只是在浪费时间，对吧？”

"Just seems kinda stupid," Shinji answered softly, setting his paper aside as well, "fighting all the time and not knowing the reason."  
“只是觉得有点蠢，”真嗣轻声回答，也放下了手中的纸，“一直在战斗却不知道原因。”

"My grandmother said that all war is stupid," Asuka said thoughtfully, "so the way I figure it, we do what we have to do and try and survive." She got to her feet, stretching languidly, "Now I'm going to take a shower… see ya…"  
“我祖母说过，所有的战争都是愚蠢的，”明日香若有所思地说，“所以我想，我们只能做我们必须做的，并努力生存下去。”她站起身，慵懒地伸展了一下，“现在我要去洗个澡……再见……”

Shinji nodded frowning slightly. It had not escaped his notice that Asuka showered at least twice a day, and sometimes as much as five times – as if she simply could not get clean. And considering what had happened to her when the angel had attacked, he could hardly blame her.  
真嗣微微皱眉点头。他没有忽视一个事实，那就是明日香至少每天洗两次澡，有时甚至多达五次——仿佛她怎么也洗不干净似的。考虑到天使袭击时她所经历的一切，他几乎无法责怪她。

Looking over the many colorful, carefully folder cranes (arranged in groups of 50 – not too keep track of how many there were of course, just because it was easier to move them that way), he could not help feeling a bit awed. Was it really only three weeks ago that she had told him she hated him? Was it really only two since she had asked for his help? Blinking, he looked around, growing more and more excited.  
看着那些五彩缤纷、精心折叠的纸鹤（每组 50 只——当然不是为了计数，只是这样搬动起来更方便），他不禁感到有些敬畏。难道真的只是三周前她才告诉他她恨他吗？难道真的只是两周前她才请求他的帮助吗？他眨了眨眼，环顾四周，越来越兴奋。

"Asuka! Asuka, come here!"  
“明日香！明日香，过来！”

"What is it?" came the irritated reply, "I'm just turning on the water!"  
"什么事？" 传来不耐烦的回答，"我只是在开水龙头！"

"Just… come here!" the boy answered, wetting his lips, "Hurry!"  
"就… 过来！" 男孩回答，舔了舔嘴唇，"快点！"

"This better be good," Asuka muttered as she came into the room a moment later, "ok – what?"  
"最好是有重要的事，" 明日香嘀咕着，片刻后走进房间，"好了 – 什么情况？"

Unable to contain himself, Shinji quickly crossed to the door, situating himself behind her and putting his hands on her shoulders. Guiding her in a slow semicircle, he whispered, "Look… look at the cranes…"  
无法抑制自己的冲动，真嗣迅速走到门前，站在她身后，双手搭在她的肩膀上。他引导她缓缓转了半圈，低声说道：“看……看那些鹤……”

"Yeah," Asuka retorted, "they're very nice, Shinji – very papery. Now I'm going to-"  
“是啊，”明日香反驳道，“它们很漂亮，真嗣——非常纸质。现在我要——”

"Count them." “数一数。”

The redhead froze, her eyes widening as she scanned the room. A soft sigh escaped her as Shinji stepped back around to face her, grinning foolishly. "Nine hundred eighty nine," she breathed, feeling his exuberance starting to fill her, "just eleven more!"  
红发女孩僵住了，她的眼睛因扫视房间而睁大。当真嗣再次绕回来面对她，傻笑着时，她轻轻叹了口气。“九百八十九，”她喘息着，感觉到他的兴奋开始感染她，“还差十一只！”

They stood in silence for a moment, then simultaneously turned and sat on the floor, side by side, and grabbed a stack of paper each. Quickly, they began folding, the air in Asuka's room becoming charged with silent energy as the two struggled to make each fold perfect, each crease as clean as possible, until they had each completed five cranes.  
他们沉默地站了一会儿，然后同时转身坐在地板上，肩并肩，各自抓起一叠纸。很快，他们开始折叠，随着两人努力使每一次折叠都完美无瑕，每一道折痕尽可能干净利落，直到各自完成了五只纸鹤，明日香房间里的空气仿佛充满了无声的能量。

"Last one," Shinji said breathlessly, setting his fifth to the side with shaking hands as Asuka picked up a square of gold paper, "this is it!"  
“最后一只，”真嗣喘着气说，颤抖的手将第五只纸鹤放到一旁，而明日香拿起一张金色的方形纸，“就是它了！”

Asuka hesitated. "You know," she said softly, running her fingers over the smooth, shiny surface, "I don't know what I'm getting all excited for, it's not like anything special is going to happen – it's just a piece of paper." Meeting his eyes, she extended her hand. "You can do it," she murmured, her voice flat and hollow, "I'm just gonna take a shower…"  
明日香犹豫了一下。“你知道，”她轻声说道，手指抚过光滑闪亮的表面，“我不明白自己在兴奋什么，又不会发生什么特别的事——它只是一张纸而已。”她迎上他的目光，伸出手。“你可以的，”她低语，声音平淡而空洞，“我先去洗个澡……”

Crestfallen, Shinji took the square. "Ok," he managed, staring into his lap as Asuka got to her feet and headed for the door. "Hey wait a sec."  
真嗣沮丧地接过那张纸。“好吧，”他勉强说道，目光盯着膝盖，而明日香站起身朝门口走去。“嘿，等一下。”

"What is it, Shinji?" Asuka answered tiredly, "It's late, I wanna go to bed."  
“什么事，真嗣？”明日香疲惫地回应，“已经很晚了，我想睡觉。”

Shinji shrugged, turning the paper over and over in his hands. "It's nothing," he said quietly, "I was just thinking that you're right – it IS just a piece of paper." He looked up at her, offering a halfhearted smile, "But still, we did all THESE together," he gestured around the room, "we could finish together." He shrugged uncomfortably, "If you want."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，手中的纸翻来覆去。“没什么，”他轻声说，“我只是在想，你说得对——它确实只是一张纸。”他抬头看着她，勉强笑了笑，“不过，我们还是一起做了这么多，”他环顾房间，“我们可以一起完成。”他不安地耸了耸肩，“如果你愿意的话。”

The Second Child considered this for a moment, looking at the paper wasteland her room had become. "Alright," she sighed, kneeling in front of him and taking the paper, "you're a sap, you know that?" she asked, making the first fold, "'Let's do it together!!' Geez, you sound like a self-help video or something."  
二号适格者考虑了一会儿，看着房间里变成的纸张荒原。“好吧，”她叹了口气，跪在他面前接过纸，“你知道吗，你真是个多愁善感的人？”她问道，开始第一次折叠，“‘让我们一起做吧！！’天哪，你听起来像是个自助视频什么的。”

Shinji blushed, but kept his smile as he made the next fold. "Yeah," he said a touch sheepishly, "maybe I do, a bit."  
真嗣脸红了，但保持着微笑继续下一次折叠。“是啊，”他有些不好意思地说，“也许我是有一点。”

"No maybe about it," Asuka insisted, taking the paper back, "this whole thing – all of this – was because of you and that silly little legend."  
“没有也许，”明日香坚持道，拿回纸张，“这一切——所有这些——都是因为你和那个愚蠢的小传说。”

Shinji's smile became softer as he made the next crease, but he said nothing. Without another word, they continued trading the paper back and forth, until only one fold remained. By silent accord, they both lay their hands on the paper, and made it together.  
真嗣的微笑变得柔和，他做了下一个折痕，但什么也没说。他们继续默默地交换着纸张，直到只剩下一次折叠。默契之下，两人同时把手放在纸上，一起完成了最后的折叠。

The silence in the room stretched on for a full minute before Asuka let out a long sigh. "There," she said quietly, frowning at the one thousandth crane, "it's done. No magic… no spell… no wishes… no golden ray of light from the heavens – just you, me, and a bunch of paper."  
房间里的沉默持续了整整一分钟，明日香才长叹一口气。“好了，”她轻声说道，皱眉看着第一千只纸鹤，“完成了。没有魔法……没有咒语……没有愿望……没有来自天堂的金色光芒——只有你，我，和一堆纸。”

Shinji nodded, feeling oddly disappointed. He had not wanted to admit it, but secretly he had been hoping for something to happen – be it magic, or divine intervention he had thought that maybe, just maybe, the legend MIGHT have a grain of truth to it. He opened his mouth to say something, but closed it, realizing there was nothing really he could say.  
真嗣点点头，感到一种莫名的失望。他本不想承认，但内心深处却暗自期待着某种事情的发生——无论是魔法还是神迹，他曾想过或许，仅仅是或许，那个传说可能有一丝真实性。他张嘴想说些什么，但又闭上了，意识到自己其实无话可说。

Time rolled on, marked by the slow, steady rhythm of their breathing and the unbroken chirping of the cicadas outside, and the Children remained still, lost in thoughts of legends, magic, and secret hopes that looked unfulfilled. Asuka drew in a breath to tell Shinji that she was going, but she let it out again slowly as she suddenly became more aware of her surroundings.  
时间缓缓流逝，伴随着他们平稳的呼吸声和窗外不绝于耳的蝉鸣，孩子们依旧静止不动，沉浸在对传说、魔法和未实现的秘密希望的思绪中。明日香深吸一口气，准备告诉真嗣她要走了，但随即又慢慢呼出，因为她突然更加意识到周围的环境。

Nothing had really changed in her room. The cranes were still strewn about, taking up every surface, a smattering of red, blue, gold, silver, and every other color of the rainbow. Her clothes were still neatly folded and tucked into her open closet, a testament to her need for order – especially in light of all that was chaotic around her. Her clock still ticked off the minutes and hours of the day, marking down each second just as the last, never caring what the next would bring. And she was still herself – still lonely, still angry, still hating.  
她的房间里其实并没有什么变化。千纸鹤依旧散落各处，占据了每一个表面，点缀着红、蓝、金、银以及彩虹的每一种颜色。她的衣服依然整齐地叠放并收在敞开的衣柜里，这证明了她在混乱中对秩序的需求。她的时钟依旧滴答作响，记录着分分秒秒，标记着每一秒都如前一秒，从不关心下一秒会带来什么。而她依然是她自己——依然孤独，依然愤怒，依然憎恨。

Wasn't she? 难道不是吗？

Looking down, Asuka noted that they both still held the crane, neither of them having released it as of yet. What she had not noticed at first, however, was that the last fold they had made had brought their fingers together, barely grazing one another at the tips. She frowned, wondering why she hadn't noticed before.  
低头看去，明日香注意到他们俩依然握着那只千纸鹤，谁也没有松手。然而，她起初没有注意到的是，他们最后一次折叠时，手指尖轻轻触碰在一起。她皱起眉头，不明白为什么之前没有注意到这一点。

**"And how many times did he touch me when we were in here, folding these?"** she thought suddenly, **"And for that matter – why is he here at all? Once he showed me how, why did I keep letting him in?"**  
"我们在这里叠这些的时候，他到底摸了我多少次？" 她突然想到，"而且说起来——他为什么还在这里？既然他教过我一次，为什么我还一直让他进来？"

"What was your wish?" Shinji asked softly, startling her out of her thoughts and making her look up at his face, though he was still looking down at the crane.  
"你的愿望是什么？" 真嗣轻声问道，打断了她的思绪，让她抬头看向他的脸，尽管他仍然低头看着那只纸鹤。

"To be happy again," Asuka replied, answering truthfully and without a second thought.  
"再次变得快乐，" 明日香回答道，真诚且毫不犹豫。

"That was mine too," the boy informed her quietly, a small frown on his face as he added, "I made one, too, when I started helping you." He blushed. "Sorry."  
"那也是我的，"男孩平静地告诉她，脸上带着一丝小小的皱眉，补充道，"我开始帮你的时候，也做了一个。"他脸红了。"对不起。"

"It's ok," the redhead whispered, still staring at the point were their fingers were brushing, "you did half of the work, you should get a wish too."  
"没关系，"红发女孩低声说，仍然盯着他们手指轻触的地方，"你完成了一半的工作，你也应该许个愿。"

Shinji said nothing for a moment, then sighed and took a breath to remind her of her forgotten shower. Like Asuka, his breath came out in a slow rush as her forefinger slowly – deliberately – slid across his, offering him a caress lighter than that of a feather. Swallowing, he looked up into her bottomless sapphire eyes, trying to ask her what she was doing, but finding that his voice had betrayed him.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后叹了口气，深吸一口气提醒她忘记的淋浴。像明日香一样，他的呼吸也缓慢而深沉，当她的食指缓慢而故意地滑过他的手指，给予他比羽毛还轻的抚摸时。他咽了咽口水，抬头望进她深邃的蓝宝石般的眼睛，试图问她在做什么，却发现自己的声音已经背叛了他。

Asuka neither smiled nor frowned as Shinji's mouth silently worked. She merely continued to look into his eyes, allowing her attention to focus on the smooth feel of his skin against hers, noting the slightly coarser texture of the skin over his knuckle, and the hard feel of bone just below the surface. Every minute detail etched itself into her mind, as if this was the most important moment ever, and it was crucial that she not forget even one aspect. She considered her wish for a moment, wondering if there really was such a thing as magic or all-powerful gods that waited for moments such as these to fulfil them.  
明日香既没有微笑也没有皱眉，当真嗣的嘴无声地动着。她只是继续凝视着他的眼睛，让自己的注意力集中在他的皮肤与她相触的平滑感觉上，注意到他指关节上皮肤略显粗糙的质感，以及皮肤下坚硬的骨骼触感。每一个微小的细节都深深地刻在她的脑海中，仿佛这是有史以来最重要的时刻，不容她忘记任何一个方面。她思考了一会儿自己的愿望，想知道是否真的存在魔法或全能的神明，等待着这样的时刻来实现它们。

Her mind went back over the time they had spent on the project, and for the life of her, she could not recall any time past the third 'session' that she had been angry, frustrated, or irritated by the boy's presence.  
她的思绪回溯到他们一起做项目的那段时间，让她费解的是，她记不起在第三次'会话'之后，有哪一刻因为男孩的存在而感到生气、沮丧或烦躁。

And even then, when they had reached the end of the road and found nothing waiting for them, she still found that she could not feel upset. Was it magic, she wondered? Unlikely… but she could not deny that, sitting in front of Shinji, barely touching his finger and looking into his eyes, she did not feel anger, nor hate, nor loathing… nor sadness.  
即使当他们走到路的尽头，发现什么也没有等待着他们时，她仍然发现自己无法感到沮丧。这是魔法吗，她疑惑？不太可能……但她无法否认，坐在真嗣面前，几乎只触碰着他的手指，凝视着他的眼睛，她没有感到愤怒、仇恨、厌恶……也没有悲伤。

She remembered the old saying that silence is golden, and so she kept hers as she gently slid her finger over his, allowing her touch to speak for her, as she knew she would not be able to articulate everything that was going through her mind.  
她记得那句老话，沉默是金，于是她保持沉默，轻轻地用手指滑过他的手指，让她的触碰替她说话，因为她知道自己无法表达出脑海中的一切。

When Shinji slowly, timidly returned her smile and began moving his finger as well, she recalled another old saying: God moves in mysterious ways.  
当真嗣慢慢地、胆怯地回以微笑，并开始移动他的手指时，她想起了另一句老话：上帝的行事方式神秘莫测。

Indeed, she thought, looking down at the small, golden crane.  
确实，她想，低头看着那只小小的金色纸鹤。

Indeed he does… 确实如此……

The End 完结

Author's notes: Mmmm… I love a nice, happy ending. ^_^ What, you weren't looking for a kiss, were you? Oh come now, they barely admitted – to themselves – that being together makes them happy… give them some time. ^_^ On a more serious note, this story was inspired by an old book I read once about a little girl. The following web page gives moving GIF instructions for making paper cranes, as well as outlining the story of Sadeko Sasaki, the little girl Shinji mentions… a very sad story about war, hope, and the indomitably of the human spirit. And believe me, it's sadder than anything I could come up with: http://home.golden.net/~msavage/cranes.html The particulars of the legend –the wings, the touching each one – I made up myself. As far as I know, the real legend has no such restrictions, I just had to make it harder for the Children. hehe. Now, I've never tried making a thousand cranes, myself… but I do kinda sorta believe in magic, so maybe one day… maybe… I'll give it a shot ^_~  
作者的话：嗯……我喜欢一个美好、幸福的结局。^_^ 什么，你没在期待一个吻吗？哦，别这样，他们才刚刚——对自己——承认在一起让他们感到快乐……给他们一些时间吧。^_^ 说点更严肃的，这个故事的灵感来自我曾读过的一本关于一个小女孩的旧书。以下网页提供了制作纸鹤的动态 GIF 教程，并概述了 Sadeko Sasaki 的故事，那个小女孩就是真嗣提到的……一个关于战争、希望和人类不屈精神的悲伤故事。相信我，这比我能想出的任何情节都要悲伤：http://home.golden.net/~msavage/cranes.html 传说中的细节——翅膀，触摸每一个——是我自己编的。据我所知，真正的传说并没有这样的限制，我只是为了让孩子们更难完成。呵呵。现在，我自己从未尝试过制作一千只纸鹤……但我确实有点相信魔法，所以也许有一天……也许……我会试试看 ^_~

Another note: this story was conceived and started before Ryoma's contest was announced, and concluded (obviously) before the deadline of 8/31/2002. The point in mentioning this? Well, I changed it a bit as a result of it being a contest entry. I decided not to have anyone do any heavy-duty pre-reading on it, and I deliberately tried to alter my writing style so it wouldn't be recognizable as me, since the stories in the contest were supposed to be read with no pre-conceived notions about the author's skills. Or lack of them. Some parts may seem a bit rushed, and since I asked my pre-readers not to go too in-depth, I'm the only one to blame for it. I don't like working against a deadline, and it always affects my performance, so I'm gonna put some of the blame on that. ^_^ Don't know if anyone cares about all that, but there it is :P  
另注：此故事构思并开始于龙马的比赛宣布之前，显然在 2002 年 8 月 31 日的截止日期之前完成。提及这一点的原因是？嗯，由于它成为比赛作品，我对其进行了一些改动。我决定不让任何人进行深入的预读，并刻意尝试改变我的写作风格，以免被认出是我，因为比赛中的故事应该在没有对作者技能的先入为主观念下阅读。或缺乏这些技能。有些部分可能显得有些仓促，因为我要求预读者不要过于深入，所以我只能为此负责。我不喜欢在截止日期前工作，它总是影响我的表现，所以我也要为此承担一些责任。^_^不知道是否有人关心这些，但这就是事实：P

Thanks to Ryoma for doing some pre-reading and catching some mistakes… and BlueTaboo for thinking the idea behind this story was worth pursuing. Thanks, I owe you both ^_^  
感谢龙马进行了一些预读并发现了一些错误……还有 BlueTaboo 认为这个故事背后的想法值得追求。谢谢，我欠你们两个的^_^
