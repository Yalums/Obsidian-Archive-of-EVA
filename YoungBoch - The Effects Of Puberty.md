Shinji's Room – Morning 真嗣的房间 – 早晨

Yet another day at school, and yet another day of a sync test. This was making to be the worst week of my life. Every single day something bad has happened; on Monday Asuka walked in on me changing, and actually cried rape. On Tuesday Misato burnt her hands trying to make a bowl of cereal. Wednesday was actually okay aside from the fact that Pen-Pen decided to use my shoes as a personal toilet. Yesterday was just horrible, Asuka was poking through my room and found a shoebox with… yeah… and blabbed it all around school. Now I'm known as the boy with three-year-old porn.  
又是一天上学日，又是一次同步测试。这周简直是我人生中最糟糕的一周。每天都有坏事发生；周一，明日香闯进我换衣服的房间，居然哭喊着被强奸了。周二，美里尝试做一碗麦片，结果把手给烫伤了。周三还算好，除了企鹅潘-潘决定用我的鞋子当私人厕所之外。昨天更是糟糕透顶，明日香在我房间里翻箱倒柜，找到了一个鞋盒，里面装着……没错……然后她就在学校里大肆宣扬。现在我成了那个拥有三年陈旧色情物品的男孩。

"Are you coming or not?!" and there was the red-headed wonder herself.  
“你到底来不来？！”红发少女明日香本人出现在眼前。

"Coming!" I follow her out of the apartment after grabbing my backpack.  
“来了！”我抓起背包，跟着她走出了公寓。

"What took you so long, looking inside the shoebox again?" she had a wide grin on, "I swear, if you're going to have that, at least have a new one! The women in there damn near had wooden teeth!" it wasn't that old…  
"你怎么这么慢，又在翻鞋盒吗？" 她笑得合不拢嘴，"我发誓，你要是还留着那玩意儿，至少也该换个新的！里面的女人都快有木头牙了！" 那也没那么旧吧…

"I told you that I was sorry! Did you have to tell everyone?" she laughed into the air.  
"我跟你说过对不起了！你非得告诉所有人吗？" 她对着空气笑了起来。

"Of course I did! Everyone had to know that the great Third Child was fapping it!" did she have to use that terminology? "You're lucky I didn't put a black light on it! I bet you can see that thing from space!" that was just nasty.  
"当然要告诉！大家都得知道伟大的三儿子在自慰！" 她非得用那个词吗？"你该庆幸我没用黑光灯照它！我打赌从太空都能看见那玩意儿！" 那可真是恶心。

"Can we please drop it?"  
"我们能不能别提这事了？"

"Fine… for now… but only because you're begging." The rest of the walk was in silence **aside** from her kicking a can the whole way. When we finally got to the school yard, she – of course – had to humiliate me again, "Hey Hikari! Wanna know what else he had in his closet?" damnit…  
"好吧……暂时先这样……不过只是因为你求我。"" 剩下的路程除了她一路踢着罐子外，我们一直沉默着。当我们终于到达学校操场时，她——当然——又得让我难堪，""嘿，光！想知道他衣柜里还有什么吗？"" 该死……

Classroom – First Bell 教室 – 第一声铃响

"Okay children, quiet down," the class continued to roar, "please, quiet down," he asked again in a monotone voice. This new teacher had no classroom management skills at all, "I SAID SHUT THE FUCK UP!" the class went instantly quiet, "Thank you," maybe I was wrong. I open my laptop and see a message waiting for me, most likely Toji about to tease me again.  
“好了，孩子们，安静下来，”教室里的喧闹声依旧，“请，安静下来，”他用单调的声音再次请求。这位新老师显然毫无课堂管理技巧，“我说了闭嘴！”教室立刻鸦雀无声，“谢谢，”也许我错了。我打开笔记本电脑，看到一条待回复的消息，很可能是 Toji 又要来取笑我了。

**You have entered room 'Shinji's Closet'

"You son of a bitch!" Toji throws his laptop at a laughing Kensuke. The whole class breaks out in laughter.  
"你这个混蛋！" 真嗣把笔记本电脑扔向正在大笑的健介。全班爆发出笑声。

"Toji… do you mind going to the principles office?" Toji stood there staring at the teacher, "Please?" Toji sat back down with a blush and buried his face in a book, "GET YOUR SORRY ASS UP AND GET OUT!" damn, this guy had a temper. As Toji ran out the teacher kicked him out of the door. I see Kensuke getting back up and sitting back in his chair. The man began to teach again as we went back to the chat-room.  
"真嗣…你介意去一趟校长办公室吗？" 真嗣站在那里盯着老师，"拜托？" 真嗣红着脸坐回座位，把脸埋进书里，"快点滚出去！" 该死，这家伙脾气真大。真嗣跑出去时，老师一脚把他踢出了门。我看到健介站起来，坐回自己的椅子上。老师又开始讲课，我们回到了聊天室。

I close the computer and plop my head on the desk. I'll never hear the end of this, I just know it…  
我关上电脑，把头埋在桌上。我知道，这事我永远也别想摆脱了…

"Squawk!" what the hell? "嘎！" 搞什么鬼？

"TURN OFF THE PHONE!" my backpack jumps in the air. When he turns back around, I look inside my backpack and see Pen-Pen in there. He had a magazine in his hands and was staring into it. 'Artic Ass' was written on the front and had a few penguins on the front. He turned it so it draped vertical and his eyes went wide.  
"把手机关掉！" 我的背包在空中跳了起来。当他转过身来时，我往背包里一看，发现 Pen-Pen 在里面。他手里拿着一本杂志，正盯着看。封面上写着'北极屁股'，还有几只企鹅。他把杂志竖起来，眼睛瞪得大大的。

"Pen-Pen," I whisper into my backpack, "what the hell are you doing here?" he looks up at me and shoves the magazine behind his back.  
"Pen-Pen，" 我对着背包低声说，"你在这里干什么？" 他抬头看着我，把杂志藏到了背后。

"Shinji Ikari… what do you have there?" Pen-Pen's eyes went wide and he threw the magazine out of my backpack and zipped it up. The teacher walks over and picks it up, "B-Bestiality… p-porn…?" the while class busts out laughing. Kensuke fall backward in his chair laughing, Asuka is literally crying, and I could hear Toji laughing in the hall, "GET OUT! GO MEET TOJI IN THE PRINCIPLES OFFICE!" with burning cheeks, I leave the room with backpack in hand, "I'll… have to confiscate this… for… real reasons…" I see him put the magazine in his desk drawer. Toji is on the floor rolling and turning purple.  
"碇真嗣…你那儿拿的是什么？" 企鹅潘的眼睛瞪得大大的，它从我的背包里扔出一本杂志并迅速拉上了拉链。老师走过来捡起杂志，"兽…兽交…色情…？" 全班爆发出笑声。剑介笑得从椅子上摔了下来，明日香笑得眼泪都出来了，我还能听到走廊上的冬二在笑，"出去！去校长办公室找冬二！" 我满脸通红地拿着背包离开了教室，"我…我得没收这个…因为…正当理由…" 我看到他把杂志放进了办公桌抽屉。冬二在地上打滚，脸色发紫。

"I… can't breath!" he's laughing so hard that he's going to kill himself! After a few minutes, he gets up and wipes a tear from his eye, "Y-You brought… that to school?" Pen-Pen's getting grass for dinner, I swear.  
"我…喘不过气了！" 他笑得太厉害，简直要笑死了！几分钟后，他站起来擦了擦眼角的泪水，"你…你把那东西带到学校来了？我发誓，潘今晚要吃草了。

"No, a penguin did!" he stares at me wide eyed and begins to laugh again, "I'm serious! Look!" I open my backpack and see it empty. Then I look down the hall to see him running with arms flailing and a sandwich in his mouth… that son of a bitch stole my lunch!  
"不，是企鹅干的！" 他瞪大眼睛看着我，又开始笑了起来，"我是认真的！看！" 我打开背包，发现里面空空如也。然后我朝走廊望去，看到他挥舞着双臂，嘴里叼着一块三明治跑掉了…那个混蛋偷了我的午餐！

"Nice one Shinji!" he put an arm around my shoulders and walked down the hall with me, "Listen, you don't need that at school, you got real girls! I don't even see why you have it at home; sure, Asuka's a demon but hey, nice body. And look at Misato! You can't tell me you've never seen anything!" actually, no. I did have something to brag about thought…  
"干得好，真嗣！" 他一手搭在我肩上，和我一起走在走廊里，"听着，你在学校不需要那个，你身边有真正的女孩！我不明白你为什么在家还留着它；当然，明日香是个恶魔，但嘿，身材不错。还有美里！你不能告诉我你从没注意过什么！" 实际上，没有。我确实有值得炫耀的东西……

"No… but I've kissed Asuka before…" he stops dead in his tracks.  
"不……但我之前吻过明日香……" 他突然停下脚步。

"Asuka? Asuka LANGLEY SOURYU? Man, dreams don't count, I'm talking REAL things."  
"明日香？明日香·兰格雷·惣流？伙计，梦里的不算，我说的是真实发生的事。"

"Me too. It was after she had a date and ditched the guy. She said she was bored and asked me if I wanted to kiss her." he went wide eyed again, "But she was obviously teasing me," he calmed down.  
"我也是。那是在她约会后甩了那个男的之后。她说她觉得无聊，问我是否想吻她。" 他又瞪大了眼睛，"但她显然是在逗我玩，" 他平静下来。

"Man, you freaked me out for a second!" he began to open the doors to the exit.  
"伙计，你刚才真把我吓了一跳！" 他开始打开通往出口的门。

"Wait, we were supposed to go the principles, where are we going?" he lets go of me as we step on the sidewalk.  
"等等，我们本来是要去见校长的，我们现在去哪儿？" 我们踏上人行道时，他放开了我。

"Are you kidding? Please tell me you're kidding! We're going to your place! Misato isn't supposed to be home for another six hours, right? Well let's hang out there!" might as well, I've had a bad enough week, what could make it worse?  
"你在开玩笑吧？请告诉我你在开玩笑！我们要去你家！美里应该还有六个小时才回家，对吧？那我们就在那儿玩吧！"反正也无所谓，我这周已经够糟糕了，还能有什么更糟的呢？

After School – Misato's Crib  
放学后 – 美里的住所

"You son of a bitch!" Asuka comes storming in the apartment and tackles me to the ground.  
"你这个混蛋！"明日香冲进公寓，将我扑倒在地。

"What?!" we were just playing video games until she came in!  
“什么？！”我们刚才只是在玩游戏，直到她进来！

"What? WHAT?!?! You told Toji about the kiss! You know damn well that's not how it happened! You forced yourself on me!" great, now she was lying about this, "Now everyone at school knows! The whole God damn class could hear you!" oh crap! Well, at least that cleared up some of the porn teasing.  
“什么？什么？！你告诉了东治那个吻的事！你明明知道根本不是那样发生的！你强迫了我！”天哪，现在她居然撒谎，“现在学校里所有人都知道了！整个该死的班级都能听到你！”哦糟糕！好吧，至少这澄清了一些色情玩笑。

"Well you did! What I said was true!" she slaps me.  
“你就是那样！我说的是真的！”她扇了我一巴掌。

"No it's not!" I could see Toji standing next to us smiling and actually turning red.  
“不，不是的！” 我看到冬二站在我们旁边，微笑着，脸居然红了。

"Asuka! I always knew you'd be on top!" ah crap… she was sitting on me…  
“明日香！我就知道你总是能站在顶端！” 啊，糟糕……她正坐在我身上……

"You asshole!" she jumps up and chases him down the street. Soon both of them are out of sight. I turn to look out the balcony, wanting to see Asuka beat on Toji, but instead I see Pen-Pen on a small beach chair laying back with a tanning mirror and glasses on. He turned and looked at me, then a drop of sweat rolled down his head.  
“你这个混蛋！” 她跳起来追着他跑过街道。很快，两人都消失在视线之外。我转向阳台，想看明日香揍冬二，却看到 Pen-Pen 躺在一张小沙滩椅上，戴着晒黑镜和墨镜。他转头看向我，然后一滴汗珠从他头上滚落。

"You're eating grass tonight you rat!" he jumps up and runs full speed into his cooler, slamming the door shut. Now that I was finally alone, I could get back at Asuka… time for some serious snooping in her room! I know guys would always jokingly say 'Never look through a girl's purse!', and we all knew why, but a room has to be ten times worse. Like I cared! I walk into her room with a pounding heart and realize that this was the first time I've been in here. It actually looked a lot like mine, just with perfume and makeup on the dresser.  
"你今晚就吃草吧，你这老鼠！" 他猛地跳起来，全速冲向他的冷藏箱，砰地一声关上门。现在我终于独自一人了，可以对明日香进行报复了……是时候在她房间里好好搜查一番了！我知道男生们总是开玩笑说“千万别翻女生的包！”，我们都知道为什么，但一个房间肯定要糟糕十倍。我才不在乎呢！我心跳加速地走进她的房间，意识到这是我第一次进来。这里其实看起来和我的房间很像，只是梳妆台上多了些香水和化妆品。

"Wanna make yourself look pretty, huh?" I walk over and open up one of the drawers, "Lets see… bra, bra, bra… damn it, nothing…" it's not like I haven't seen them before. Hell, I do all of the laundry around here. I go down a drawer and open it, once again all panties and socks. "There has to be something here!" I look under the bed and see something shiny. I reach in and pull it out, "Good lord…" I held in my hand a small plastic cage full of mice, "Let's just put this back and pretend I never saw it… sounds good?" I put it back under and continue my search. I go over to the homework covered desk and open up the drawer it had, "Pen, pencil, paper, pencil, paperclip, nothing!" I slam the drawer closed in anger, causing the desk to shake. I hear a loud thump on the floor under it. I look under it to see a small pink book… score! I grab it and run to my room.  
"想让自己看起来漂亮点，嗯？" 我走过去打开其中一个抽屉，"让我看看……胸罩，胸罩，胸罩……该死，什么都没有……" 又不是我以前没见过。见鬼，这里的衣服都是我洗的。我又打开一个抽屉，里面全是内裤和袜子。"这里肯定有什么东西！" 我往床底下看，发现有东西在闪光。我伸手进去把它拿出来，"我的天……" 我手里拿着一个小塑料笼子，里面装满了老鼠，"我们还是把它放回去，假装我从来没见过……听起来不错吧？" 我把笼子放回床下，继续我的搜索。我走到堆满作业的书桌前，打开它上面的抽屉，"钢笔，铅笔，纸，铅笔，回形针，什么都没有！" 我愤怒地猛关上抽屉，桌子都晃了一下。我听到地板下传来一声巨响。我往桌子底下一看，发现了一本小小的粉色书……太棒了！我抓起它跑回自己的房间。

"Finally!" I can't believe Asuka keeps a diary! "Lets see here… how about Monday… 'I actually walked in on him! OMG! What the hell is his problem?! He could have at least locked the door! I have to admit though… not bad…' WHAT!?" I slam the book closed and shove it under my bed. Did… did I just read what I thought I read? Curiosity killed that cat as I pulled it back out, "Good lord… 'Not bad… at least he has something to brag about.' This isn't Asuka, I just know it! What about Tuesday? 'Misato can't cook worth shit! She actually burnt her hands making cold cereal!' that wasn't so bad. Wednesday, 'OMFG! Pen-Pen took a crap in Shinji's shoes!' that's it? Damn… okay, what about Thursday? 'Uh… yeah, I found a porno in Shinji's room… to think I was going to actually ask him today. He just lost a BUNCH of respect," I hear the door open to the apartment and I shove it back under my bed.  
"终于！" 我简直不敢相信明日香居然有写日记的习惯！"让我看看……比如周一……‘我居然撞见他了！我的天！他到底有什么毛病？！至少该把门锁上吧！不过得承认……还不赖……’什么！？" 我猛地合上日记本，塞到床底下。我……我刚刚读到的真是那个意思吗？好奇心驱使我再次把它拽了出来，"天哪……‘不赖……至少他有东西可吹嘘了。’这绝对不是明日香，我敢肯定！那周二呢？‘美里做饭简直一塌糊涂！她居然在做冷麦片时烫伤了手！’这倒没什么。周三，‘我的妈呀！Pen-Pen 在真嗣的鞋里拉屎了！’就这样？该死……好吧，那周四呢？‘呃……对，我在真嗣房间里发现了一本色情杂志……本打算今天问他的。他这下可失去了一大堆我的尊重，’我听到公寓的门开了，赶紧又把日记本塞回床下。

"Oh, Shinjiiiii!" Asuka sang my name? "I have a gift for you!" I walk out of my room and see her waiting in the hallway, "There you are! Come here, I got you a gift…" I walk over to her slowly and she puts her arms around my neck, "You know that kiss? It wasn't real… and just so you know…" she gets anger in her eyes and knees me in the groin, "IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN!" she stormed off to her room and slammed the door shut.  
"哦，新二～～～！" 明日香拖长音喊我的名字？"我有礼物给你！" 我走出房间，看到她在走廊里等着，"你在这儿！过来，我有礼物给你……" 我慢慢走向她，她张开双臂搂住我的脖子，"你知道那个吻吗？那不是真的……而且，你得知道……" 她的眼中燃起怒火，猛地用膝盖顶向我的下体，"再也不会发生了！" 她怒气冲冲地回到自己的房间，砰的一声关上了门。

"Why… me…? Uhhhhh…" I laid on the floor in pain.  
"为什么……是我……？呃……" 我痛苦地躺在地板上。

"Because you're an asshole!"  
"因为你是个混蛋！"

A/N- Okay, this was supposed to be a one-shot, but NOOOO, I have too many ideas, so I'll split it up into chapters. You know the routine by now; what was in Asuka's diary? Was that a joke? Will Shinji ever have kids? Find out in the next chapter; Growth, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记- 好吧，这原本打算是一篇短篇，但天哪，我脑洞太大，所以决定分成章节。你们现在应该熟悉流程了；明日香日记里写了什么？那是个玩笑吗？真嗣会有孩子吗？下回分解chapter；成长篇，在此之前，继续加油吧！

### Chapter 2: Growth

Hallway – Five Minutes Later  
走廊 – 五分钟后

"I'm home!" I hear Misato go to the fridge and chug her normal beer, "Oh yeah! That's the stuff!" she comes walking into the hallway and sees me on the floor, still holding it in pain, "Let me guess, you saw her naked?" yeah, I wish.  
"“我回来了！” 我听到美里走向冰箱，猛灌她常喝的啤酒，“哦耶！就是这个味儿！” 她走进走廊，看到我仍痛苦地躺在地上，“让我猜猜，你看到她裸体了？” “是啊，我倒希望是这样。”

"I kiss and told… and paid for it…" she offered a hand to help me up, "No… no I'm good right here… thanks though," I probably still couldn't walk after that. I have never been in such pain, I swear, they got pushed up into my body cavity.  
"我亲了还说了出去…结果付出了代价…"她伸出手来帮我起来，"不…不了，我在这儿挺好的…谢谢了，"我估计那之后我还是走不了路。我从未经历过如此剧痛，我发誓，它们简直被推到了我的身体腔内。

"Okay, if you say so. Wait… kiss and told? How'd ya kiss, huh? Was it Rei? My little Shinji's growing up! That's so cute! Young love… I sure miss that…" Rei? Where did she get that from?  
"好吧，如果你这么说的话。等等…亲了还说出去？你怎么亲的，嗯？是丽吗？我的小真嗣长大了！真可爱！年轻的爱啊…我真怀念那段时光…" 丽？她从哪儿冒出来的？

"Not quite… it was Asuka…" Asuka's door swings open again… shit!  
"不是她…是明日香…"明日香的门再次打开…糟糕！

"Okay you horny son of a bitch! Where is it? I know you took it!" she picked me up by my hair, "Tell me!" all I could do was act innocent.  
"好了，你这个色鬼！它在哪儿？我知道是你拿的！" 她揪着我的头发把我提起来，"告诉我！" 我只能装作无辜。

"Huh? What are you talking about?" she literally threw me into the living room by my hair. I flew over the couch and land on the foot rest. Pen-Pen comes out of his cooler holding a sign that said '9.5'.  
"啊？你在说什么？" 她居然揪着我的头发把我扔进了客厅。我飞过沙发，落在脚凳上。Pen-Pen 从他的冷却器里出来，举着一个写着'9.5'的牌子。

"You know damn well what I mean! You went through my room didn't you?! I swear, if you read it, I'll kill you!" she went into my room and came out a few seconds later holding the pink book and walking to me, "Brace yourself Third! You want to know about me? How about I show you my throwing ability?" she picks me up and takes me out to the balcony.  
"你他妈的知道我在说什么！你翻了我的房间对吧？！我发誓，如果你看了，我就杀了你！" 她走进我的房间，几秒钟后拿着那本粉红色的书出来，朝我走来，"准备好了吗，第三！你想了解我？不如我展示一下我的投掷能力？" 她把我拎起来，带到了阳台上。

"Whoa! Asuka, let him down!" don't say that! She grabs my ankles and dangles me over the edge.  
"“哇！明日香，放他下来！”别这么说！她抓住我的脚踝，把我悬在边缘。”

"Okay, you said so!" no! She lets go of my ankles and I land in Misato's car… thank God for open roofs!  
"“好吧，你说的！”不！她松开了我的脚踝，我掉进了美里小姐的车里……感谢上帝，车顶是开着的！”

"You okay Shinji?" I see Misato looking over the edge and Pen-Pen in her arms, still holding the sign. He turned it around to the other side that said 'Grass my feathery black ass!' great, now I had a penguin that hated me.  
"“你还好吗，真嗣？”我看到美里小姐探头看着边缘，怀里还抱着企鹅潘-潘，依然举着那块牌子。他把牌子翻到了另一面，上面写着‘草地，我那乌黑的羽毛屁股！’太好了，现在我有了只讨厌我的企鹅。”

"I'm fine!" I position myself on the passenger's side of the car and put on the seat belt, "Don't we have a sync test today?" she smiled and left the balcony, leaving Asuka to look down on me, "Hey Asuka!" I wave up to her. She then lets a huge logy fall onto me… I can see it falling in slow-motion, aiming right for my face… damn it! She smiles down at me and left. I grab a tissue and wipe off her assault. Misato climbs into the drivers seat and faces me.  
"我没事！" 我坐到副驾驶座上，系好安全带，"今天不是有同步测试吗？" 她笑了笑，离开了阳台，留下明日香俯视着我，"嘿，明日香！" 我向她挥手。她随即让一根巨大的木头朝我砸来……我能看到它在慢动作中直奔我的脸……该死！她笑着俯视我，然后离开了。我抓起一张纸巾擦掉她的攻击。美里爬进驾驶座，面对着我。

"Good thing you remembered, cause I completely forgot. Akagi would have killed- Shinji duck!" I feel something hard hit the back of my head, sending my head flying into Misato… with my luck, take a wild guess where my head landed. Was that good or bad luck? "Shinji, I thought I told you I was off limits…" I whip my head back and look at Asuka, then at a recently thrown shoe.  
"幸好你记得，我完全忘了。赤木律子会杀了——真嗣，快躲！" 我感到有什么硬物击中了我的后脑勺，让我的头猛地撞向美里……以我的运气，猜猜我的头落在了哪里。那是好运还是坏运？"真嗣，我以为我告诉过你我不在范围内……" 我猛地回头看向明日香，然后看向刚刚扔过来的鞋子。

"Can we just go before she kills me?" Asuka climbed into the back seat behind me and Misato drove off. I can feel Asuka start to put her head next to mine, but out of the view of Misato.  
"我们能走了吗，在她杀了我之前？" 明日香爬进我身后的后座，美里开车离开了。我能感觉到明日香开始把头靠在我旁边，但美里看不到。

"You read it, didn't you…?" she actually sounded worried… might as well lie.  
"你读了，对吧…？" 她听起来真的有些担心…干脆撒个谎吧。

"Nah, I just tried to freak you out," she laughed a little.  
"没有，我只是想吓吓你，" 她轻声笑了笑。

"You know, you're a really bad liar. Fine, you read it, just don't tell anyone… please? It was just a moment… a really, REALLY stupid moment," hey she knew… so why not take this opportunity to get her back?  
"你知道的，你真的很不会撒谎。好吧，你读了，但别告诉任何人…好吗？那只是个瞬间…一个非常，非常愚蠢的瞬间，" 她自己都明白…那为什么不趁机反击她一下呢？

"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. So… you DID like it, huh?" she grabbed my ear and pulled. I keep quiet, but it hurts like a bitch!  
"别担心，我不会告诉任何人。所以……你确实喜欢，是吧？" 她抓住我的耳朵一拽。我保持沉默，但疼得要命！

"What was that Third?" "那是什么，Third？"

"Nothing… now let go…" she leaned back in her seat, "damn…"  
"没什么……现在放手……" 她向后靠在椅子上，"该死……"

"What was that Shinji?" crap! Misato heard me!  
“那是什么，真嗣？”该死！美里听到了！

"Uh… nothing Misato… sorry about before," she laughed into the air… I think Asuka was rubbing off on her.  
“呃…没什么，美里…刚才抱歉了，”她对着空气笑了笑…我觉得明日香的影响在她身上越来越明显了。

"Hey, don't worry about it. If you think I'm still sexy at this age, I'm fine!" before I could say anything, the car comes to a screeching halt, "We're here! No go get changed, Rits' said that she has a surprise for you kids," that actually sounded good to me. Apparently to Asuka too, she ran all the way to the locker room! I get changed fairly quickly and head down to my Eva. We haven't had a sync test in awhile; after the seventeenth angel was defeated, there really hasn't been much of a purpose for it. I'd say this was the first one in about two months now. I meet Asuka, Rei, Misato and Akagi in the control room, and notice all of them staring at me.  
“嘿，别在意。如果你觉得我这个年纪依然性感，那我可没问题！”在我能说什么之前，车猛地刹住了，“我们到了！快去换衣服，律子说给你们准备了惊喜，”这听起来确实不错。显然对明日香也是，她一路跑向更衣室！我很快换好衣服，前往我的 EVA。我们已经有一段时间没进行同步测试了；自从第十七使徒被击败后，真的没什么必要了。我想这是近两个月来的第一次。我在控制室见到了明日香、绫波、美里和赤木，注意到他们都盯着我看。

"Huh… I haven't seen you in one of those in awhile… wow…" Akagi looked at me up and down.  
"嗯…我有一阵子没见你穿这种衣服了…哇…" 赤木上下打量着我。

"Pilot… Ikari?" Rei had a slight shade of pink on her cheeks as she looked at me. What were they all talking about? Even Asuka was staring at me!  
"驾驶员…碇？" 绫波脸上泛起一抹淡淡的粉红，看着我。他们在说什么呢？就连明日香也在盯着我看！

"I… think we should get started…" finally, Misato broke them up, "You kids head to your entry plugs, okay? You'll see what the surprise is when you get there," we all make out way to our plugs and climb in.  
"我…觉得我们应该开始了…" 终于，美里打破了沉默，"你们这些孩子去驾驶舱吧，好吗？等你们到了那里就会知道惊喜是什么了，" 我们各自走向驾驶舱，爬了进去。

"Okay, so what's the surprise?" Asuka stared straight ahead, but occasionally stole glances at me. What were they looking at?!  
"“好吧，那么惊喜是什么？” 明日香直视前方，但时不时偷偷瞥我一眼。他们在看什么？！”

"This," Akagi flips a switch and our LCL turns a light shade of green. Nothing happened until I looked over at Asuka. When I did, I hear her voice, but her lips weren't moving.  
"“这个，” 赤城按下开关，我们的 LCL 变成了浅绿色。什么都没发生，直到我转头看向明日香。当我这么做时，我听到了她的声音，但她的嘴唇并没有动。”

"God, I can't believe he read that! And after seeing him like THIS, wow. How the hell did he change so much? He actually looks like a man now. I could have sworn I saw a little bit of I six pack on him! Damn, no wonder I've been looking at him…" what the hell? I look over at Rei and some heavy metal began to play.  
"“天啊，真不敢相信他读了那个！而且看到他变成这样，哇。他到底是怎么变得这么多的？他现在看起来真像个男人。我敢打赌我看到了一点腹肌！该死，难怪我一直盯着他……” 什么鬼？我转头看向绫波，突然响起了重金属音乐。”

"I've been waiting my whole life for just one, FUCK! And all I needed was just one, FUCK! You can say that you don't give a, FUCK! Find myself stupify, I'll be back again." What the hell was this? "All I wanted was just one, FUCK! One tiny little innocent, FUCK! And when I feel like I'm shit out of, LUCK! Find myself stupify, I'll be back again!"  
"我这辈子就等那么一次，操！我只需要那么一次，操！你可以说不屑一顾，操！发现自己傻眼了，我会再回来的。" 这他妈是什么？"我想要的只是那么一次，操！一个小小的无辜的，操！当我感觉自己倒霉透顶，操！发现自己傻眼了，我会再回来的！"

"Um… is this a joke?" was I the only one noticing this?  
"呃… 这是个玩笑吗？" 只有我注意到这个吗？"

"Nope, what you're hearing is the other pilot's inner thoughts. We thought it would help with your combat skills." Both of the girls shoot up and glare at Akagi.  
"不，你听到的是另一个飞行员的心声。我们以为这能帮你提高战斗技能。" 两个女孩同时站起来，瞪着赤城。"

"WHAT?!" They both yell in unison. That was the first time I've heard Rei yell! They both look at me at the same time… crap.  
"什么？！" 他们齐声大喊。这是我第一次听到丽大喊！他们同时看向我……糟糕。

"Wonder what I'd look like in a dress… huh… I think it would be blue, I like blue… I'm a pretty lady!" damn inner thoughts.  
"不知道我穿裙子会是什么样子……嗯……我觉得会是蓝色的，我喜欢蓝色……我是个漂亮的姑娘！" 该死的内心想法。

"Uhhhh…" Asuka just stared at me with wide eyes, "Never say that again, ever."  
"呃……" 明日香只是瞪大眼睛盯着我，"永远不要再那样说了，永远。"

"That was… odd…" now Rei was calling ME odd? Great! Just great!  
"“那真是……奇怪……”现在丽居然说我奇怪？太好了！真是太好了！”

"Akagi… how about we turn this off, huh? I think I'm getting to know Shinji WAY too much today," Misato practically begged her to turn it off. Thankfully she did and the LCL went back to yellow.  
"“赤木……我们把这关掉吧，好吗？我觉得我今天对真嗣了解得太多了，”美里几乎是恳求她关掉。幸好她照做了，LCL 也恢复了黄色。”

"I… doubt that will assist us in battle…" at least Rei was on the right track.  
"“我……怀疑这不会对我们战斗有帮助……”至少丽走对了方向。”

"Okay, let's start the test," a long pause, "Okay, Asuka has an 87, Rei has a, 85, and Shinji… wow… Shinji's at a 95. Not bad! You know, that thing with the dress actually freaked me out, but hey, with scores like these, who's complaining." Why was I so high? It's not like anything changed… according to me at least, "Okay, we're done for today, I'm letting you off early so you can get a decent night's rest. Go and get changed, have a good night… God I need a drink…" Akagi leaves the room as we exit our entry plugs. Asuka looked at me and blushed. Who needed to read minds? She was hoping that I didn't hear what she said.  
"好了，我们开始测试吧，" 长长的停顿后，"好的，明日香得了 87 分，绫波得了 85 分，而真嗣……哇……真嗣得了 95 分。不错啊！你知道，那件关于礼服的事情真的吓到我了，但嘿，有这些分数，谁还会抱怨呢。" 为什么我分数这么高？对我来说，似乎什么都没变……"好了，今天到此为止，我提前放你们走，好让你们晚上能好好休息。去换衣服吧，晚安……天啊，我需要喝一杯……" 赤木离开了房间，我们则从插入栓中出来。明日香看着我，脸红了。谁还需要读心术？她肯定希望我没听到她说的话。

"Hey Shinji, can I talk with you?" Misato waved me over to a corner away from everyone… I'm gonna get killed…  
"嘿，真嗣，我能和你谈谈吗？" 美里挥手示意我到一个远离大家的地方……我这是要被训话了……

"Um… yeah, if you want to." She put a hand on my shoulder and smiled.  
"嗯……可以，如果你愿意的话。" 她把手放在我的肩膀上，微笑着。

"Look, I know you heard what Asuka was thinking… I recommend you don't say a word about it. She not only would be embarrassed, she would kill you. Okay?" I give a slight nod. There was no need for an argument when she's right! We both look at Asuka as she walks down the bridge, and I see Misato get a wide grin, "So, you DID notice, huh?" I look at her. What was she talking about?  
"听着，我知道你听到了明日香的想法……我建议你对此闭口不谈。她不仅会感到尴尬，还会杀了你。好吗？" 我微微点头。既然她是对的，就没必要争论了！我们俩看着明日香走过舰桥，我看到美里露出了得意的笑容，"所以，你确实注意到了，嗯？" 我看着她。她在说什么呢？

"Huh? Notice what?" her smile gets wider.  
"啊？注意到什么？" 她的笑容更灿烂了。

"Come on, don't tell me you don't know I'm talking about. I see you looking at her, and so do other people. She's really becoming a woman, huh?" well… okay, I'll give her that.  
"拜托，别告诉我你不知道我在说什么。我看到你在看她，其他人也看到了。她真的越来越有女人味了，嗯？" 嗯……好吧，这点我承认。

"Why are we talking about this? I don't even know what you're talking about…" I'm a bad liar, and everyone knew it.  
“我们为什么要谈这个？我甚至不知道你在说什么……” 我是个糟糕的说谎者，大家都知道。

"Oh, you know what I'm talking about! Look at her! Even her face is changing a little! In the last month alone, she's gone up a bra size, become EXTREMLY moody, and… well, you read the diary," how did she know about her diary? "Truthfully, I'm surprised Gendo is letting her stay in the same house as you."  
“哦，你知道我在说什么！看她！连她的脸都有点变了！仅上个月，她的胸围就增加了一个尺寸，情绪变得极其不稳定，而且……好吧，你读了她的日记，” 她怎么知道她的日记？“说实话，我惊讶于源堂居然让她和你住在同一屋檐下。”

那人脸上露出一丝微笑，“没有天使，就没有乐趣……除非你让它变得有趣。”

Back 返回

"Can we please drop this?" I start to walk away from her, not wanting to say something stupid like I always do. I get to the locker room and change back into my normal clothes and walk back out, running into Asuka as I do, "Oh, sorry."  
“我们能不能别提这个了？”我开始从她身边走开，不想像往常一样说出什么蠢话。我走到更衣室，换回平常的衣服，走出来时撞上了明日香，“哦，对不起。”

"Watch the hands Third, you came damn close," with a smack on the back, she meets Misato half-way down the hall. They begin to talk and Asuka blushes, no doubt having the same conversation she just had with me. Misato laughs at something and starts to walk towards the car.  
"看手势，第三次，你差点就成功了，"她拍了拍我的背，在走廊半途遇到了美里。她们开始交谈，明日香脸红了，无疑是在重复刚刚和我进行的对话。美里对某事笑了笑，然后开始向车子走去。

"You kids coming?" me and Asuka look at each other then take off after Misato. Did she really have to tell me all that? I mean damn, isn't that supposed to be between just girls or something? We all climb into the car in the same setup we had on the way here. Misato speeds off to the apartment.  
"你们这些孩子不来吗？"我和明日香对视一眼，然后追上了美里。她真的有必要告诉我所有这些吗？我是说，该死的，这不应该是只属于女孩子们的秘密吗？我们按照来时的座位顺序爬进了车里。美里加速驶向公寓。

"So… Shinji had a high score today, what's the deal?" trying to make a conversation, Asuka speaks up. Even I was a little curious about that, how exactly did that happen?  
"那么…真嗣今天得分很高，这是怎么回事？"明日香试图开启话题。就连我也对此有点好奇，究竟是怎么发生的？

"Well, the Evas are piloted by how clear the pilot's mind is, so I take it Shinji's mind is clear…" like hell it was! "You had an okay test score too, ya know." She lets out a long sigh.  
"嗯，Eva 的驾驶取决于驾驶员心灵的清晰度，所以我猜渚薰的心灵很清晰……" 才怪呢！"你的测试成绩也不错，你知道的。" 她长长地叹了口气。

"I know, but it doesn't really matter anymore." She was right about that at least. All of the angels are gone, so there's really no need for any of us.  
"我知道，但现在已经无关紧要了。" 至少在这点上她是对的。所有的使徒都消失了，所以我们真的没有必要再继续了。

Misato's Crib – 8:00 PM  
美里家 – 晚上 8 点

"Okay, your turn to cook Third!" I already cooked every night, this just happened to be the only night actually assigned to me.  
"好了，轮到你做饭了，三号！" 我已经每晚都做饭了，这只是碰巧是我被分配到的唯一一晚。

"Okay," with my normal attitude, I enter the kitchen and put together some instant noodles. I wasn't really in the mood to cook a full meal… they can last one night without one, right? Pen-Pen walks up to my side as I finish pouring the last of it into the third bowl. "There's plenty of grass outside… eat up," he gets fire in his eye and squawks loud. He jumps up onto the counter, slaps me across the face, and takes one of the bowls, running back to his cooler as he did… great, no dinner for me.  
"好吧，" 我带着平常的态度走进厨房，准备了一些方便面。我实在没心情做一顿完整的饭……他们一晚上不吃也没事，对吧？当我把最后一碗倒满时，Pen-Pen 走到我身边。"外面有很多草……吃吧，" 他眼中闪着怒火，大声叫着。他跳上柜台，扇了我一巴掌，抢走一碗面，跑回他的冷却器里……太好了，我没晚饭吃了。

"I smell food!" Misato comes storming into the kitchen and grabs one of the bowls, "Nice!" she runs back to the table and digs in.  
"我闻到食物的味道了！" 美里冲进厨房，抓起一碗面，"不错！" 她跑回餐桌，大口吃起来。

"Uh… that was Asuka's… she wanted it extra hot…" she lifted up her head and looked at me. Her eyes began to water and her face turns red.  
"呃…那是明日香的…她想要特别辣的…" 她抬起头看着我。她的眼睛开始泛泪，脸也变红了。

"AH!" she leaps for the fridge and downs a beer in one gulp, "What are you trying to do, kill me?!" she was still red! Asuka came walking into the kitchen and sat down in front of her bowl, and then took a huge bite, "How the hell are you eating that?" she takes another beer and chugs it.  
"啊！" 她冲向冰箱，一口气喝完了一罐啤酒，"你想干嘛，杀了我吗？！" 她的脸还是红的！明日香走进厨房，坐在她的碗前，然后咬了一大口，"你怎么吃得下那个？" 她又拿了一罐啤酒，一口气喝完。

"It's not that bad… baby…"  
"没那么糟…宝贝…"

Shinji's Room – 1:00 AM  
真嗣的房间 – 凌晨 1:00

An hour two hours and I still can't get to sleep! I've been thinking about what Asuka wrote and what she 'said' back at NERV. Was she kidding? She had to be teasing me, there was just no way she was serious!  
一个小时，两个小时过去了，我还是睡不着！我一直在想明日香写的东西和她之前在 NERV‘说’的话。她是在开玩笑吧？她肯定是在逗我，她不可能是认真的！

"Shinji? Can… I come in?" for once, Asuka actually knocked. What was she doing up this late?  
“真嗣？我……可以进来吗？”明日香居然真的敲门了。这么晚了，她在做什么？

"Uh… yeah, sure," the door creaked open to show her in a long t-shirt, "You need something?" she walked over to the side of my bed as I sat up. She had a disgusted look on her face.  
"呃… 是的，当然，" 门吱呀一声打开，她穿着一件长 T 恤出现在门口，"你需要什么吗？" 她走到我的床边，我坐了起来。她脸上带着厌恶的表情。

"Kinda… Misato forgot to take Pen-Pen for a walk… he kinda used my bed…" what has gotten into him lately? "Thanks a lot for making him eat grass! I swear, it could not smell worse in there!" Asuka's back.  
"有点… 美里忘了带 Pen-Pen 去散步… 他好像在我的床上…" 他最近怎么了？ "多亏了你让他吃草！我发誓，那里闻起来不能再糟糕了！" 明日香的后背。

"Sorry, I'll go change the sheets," I get up and start to walk out of the room/  
"对不起，我去换床单，" 我起身开始走出房间/

"You can't, he stole the spare sheets and made a bed in the cooler."  
"你不能，他偷了备用床单，在冷藏室里铺了床。"

"I've trained you well Pen-Pen…" he let a small smile escape as he watched the two teens over the hidden camera in Shinji's room.  
"我把你训练得很好，Pen-Pen……" 他微微一笑，通过隐藏在真嗣房间的摄像头观察着那两个少年。

---

"Well, let me at least get those sheets off," I walk into her room and see a few small piles of brown pellets on her green sheets, "I'll get you back for this…" I start to take off the sheets and – when I do – I bundle it up in a ball, trying to keep all of his 'gifts' in there. If I just threw them off the balcony, no one would care, right? I hang the sheet over the edge and shake it clean.  
"好吧，至少让我把这些床单拿掉，"我走进她的房间，看到几小堆棕色的小颗粒散落在她的绿色床单上，"我会让你为此付出代价的……"我开始拆下床单，当我这么做时，我把它们卷成一团，试图把他的'礼物'都包在里面。如果我只是把它们扔下阳台，没人会在意，对吧？我把床单挂在边缘，摇晃着清理干净。

"Hey you little brat! What the hell was that for?" a guy walking below caught the full rain of the pellets. I run back inside and pray he doesn't come up here.  
"嘿，你这个小鬼！那是什么意思？"一个走在下面的家伙被这些小颗粒的'雨'淋了个正着。我跑回屋内，祈祷他不要上来。

"Okay, I'll clean these tomorrow," I throw them into the laundry basket… just more work for me to do. Asuka has made herself comfortable sitting on my bed, actually waiting for me to come back, "For now… I guess you could sleep in my bed. I mean, there's no where else to go," she looked up at me wide eyed.  
"好吧，我明天再清理这些，"我把它们扔进洗衣篮……只是又多了些活儿要我做。明日香已经舒舒服服地坐在我的床上，实际上是在等我回来，"现在……我想你可以睡在我的床上。我是说，没有别的地方可去了，"她睁大眼睛看着我。

"Are you serious? I can't do that! It's your bed!" was she actually being nice? Maybe she is growing up…  
"你是认真的吗？我不能那样做！那是你的床！" 她真的在对我好吗？也许她在成长……

"Really, I don't mind. I'll just sleep on the sofa or something. Have a good night," I start to walk out of the room, knowing how bad my back is going to hurt in the morning.  
"真的，我不介意。我就在沙发上睡或者别的什么地方。晚安，" 我开始走出房间，心里清楚明早我的背会有多疼。

"Thanks…" she mumbled as I closed the door. In fact, I was fairly surprised she was even willing to sleep in there. I fall back onto the sofa… forgetting that it was a folding sofa. It snaps shut, leaving my face buried in the back of it and my body sandwiched between the seat and the back… and I can't move.  
"谢谢……" 她咕哝着，我关上了门。事实上，我相当惊讶她甚至愿意睡在那里。我向后倒在沙发上……忘记了那是一张折叠沙发。它突然合上，我的脸埋在了沙发背里，身体被夹在座位和靠背之间……而我动弹不得。

"Hon ou a fitch…" looks like I'll be sleeping here for the night. I take a deep breath and try to relax as much as I could. Obviously, I still couldn't get to sleep.  
"Hon ou a fitch…" 看来今晚得在这儿过夜了。我深吸一口气，尽可能地放松自己。显然，我还是无法入睡。

"Hm… amusing… so Shinji, you gave up your bed and now you're trapped… what will you do n- huh? Rei's up… Rei's taking a shower…" the Commander stared at the screen with his normal face, only with a drop of sweat trickling down his forehead.  
"嗯…有趣…所以真嗣，你放弃了你的床，现在被困住了…你会怎么做呢——嗯？丽起来了…丽在洗澡…" 指挥官盯着屏幕，脸上依旧是平常的表情，只是额头上多了一滴汗珠。

Morning – Inside The Sofa  
早晨 – 沙发内部

"Hey Shinji! Where'd ya go?" I knew I wouldn't be able to get to sleep. I was up all night, and by now, I was drenched in sweat from the heat. Apparently Asuka was up and looking for me, "Hellooooo?" I struggle, making the sofa creek, "What is tha- ah!" I hear her fall backwards, "What the hell is your problem?! You scared the shit out of me!" she popped open the sofa and I came tumbling out, gasping for a fresh breath, "What were you doing?"  
"嘿，真嗣！你跑哪儿去了？" 我知道我睡不着。我整晚没睡，现在已经被热得满身大汗。显然明日香已经起床并开始找我，"喂——？" 我挣扎着，让沙发吱吱作响，"这是什——啊！" 我听到她向后摔倒的声音，"你搞什么鬼？！你吓死我了！" 她猛地拉开沙发，我滚了出来，大口喘着新鲜空气，"你在干什么？"

"Just… hangin' out…" she actually let out a chuckle!  
"只是……闲逛……" 她居然笑出声了！

A/N- Okay, I admit this chapter had some serious slow parts, but whatever. What will school be like today? Will Toji still be alive? Find out in the next chapter; Self Confession, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者注- 好吧，我承认这章chapter有些部分确实拖沓，但无所谓了。今天学校会是什么样子呢？Toji 还会活着吗？下一章chapter《自我告白》中揭晓，在此之前，继续加油吧！

### Chapter 3: Self Confession
On The Way To School  
上学路上

"Hey, thanks again for letting me use your bed. That was really nice of you… especially seeing as what happened on the couch!" I just chuckle, trying not to ruin this good moment, "What happened to Pen-Pen? You said that you were going to get him back, what did you do?"  
“嘿，再次感谢你让我用你的床。你真是太好了……尤其是考虑到沙发上发生的事！”我只是轻笑，不想破坏这美好的时刻，“Pen-Pen 怎么样了？你说你会把他带回来的，你做了什么？”

---

Back At Misato's 回到美里家

"Squa-a-a-awk!!!" a certain penguin was duct-taped to the couch with eyes taped open. The TV showed a certain show that Pen-Pen just despised… Jerry Springer… DUN DUN DUUUN!!!  
"嘎——！！！"某只企鹅被胶带牢牢地粘在沙发上，眼睛也被胶带撑开。电视上播放着 Pen-Pen 极其讨厌的某个节目……杰瑞·斯普林格……噔噔噔！！！

"Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!" Pen-Pen stared helplessly at the TV.  
"杰瑞！杰瑞！杰瑞！" Pen-Pen 无助地盯着电视。

"Fuck!" "该死！"

---

Back On The Streets 重返街头

"I let him watch TV. He's a good pet normally, so I let him off. How'd you sleep?" like hell I let him off!  
"我让他看电视。他通常是个好宠物，所以我放他一马。你睡得怎么样？" 见鬼，我才没放他一马！"

"Pretty good…" she went quiet, "especially since I had your pillow," what the hell?  
"相当不错……" 她突然安静下来，"尤其是我用了你的枕头，搞什么鬼？

"E-Excuse me? What was that last part?" she looked at me and raised an eyebrow, "What did you just say?" I must have misheard, there was no way she'd say that to me, let alone out in public!  
"你说什么？最后那部分是什么意思？" 她看着我，挑起眉毛，"你刚才说什么？" 我一定是听错了，她不可能对我说那种话，更别提在大庭广众之下了！

"I said I slept good… that's it. Why? Are you feeling okay?" she had a serious look on her face. Maybe I was hearing things, "He's kinda cute when he's all jumpy!" now that I know I heard! But her lips didn't move…  
"我说我睡得很好……就这样。怎么了？你还好吗？" 她脸上带着严肃的表情。也许是我听错了，"他紧张兮兮的样子还挺可爱的！" 现在我确定我听到了！但她的嘴唇并没有动……

"N-Never mind… let's keep going," what the hell was this? She shrugs and looks back at the near-by school.  
"算了……我们继续走吧，"这到底是什么鬼？她耸了耸肩，回头看向附近的学校。

"Another stupid day at this stupid school with all of the stupid teachers… damnit…" I actually laugh out loud at what she said.  
"又是这个破学校里无聊的一天，还有那些烦人的老师……该死……"我听到她的话，忍不住笑出声来。

"Tell me about it!" she shoots her head over at me and once again gives a confused look.  
"说得太对了！"她猛地转头看向我，又一次露出了困惑的表情。

"Are you sure you're okay? You're acting really weird…" what the hell was she talking about? Maybe I am going crazy! "Oh! Hey Hikari!" Asuka goes running off to Hikari's side, once again leaving me alone. I walk to our classroom, knowing that Toji and Kensuke will be there. This was about the only thing I could rely on, and the only thing I was always right about.  
"你确定你没事吗？你表现得真的很奇怪……" 她到底在说什么？也许我真的疯了！"哦！嘿，光！" 明日香又跑向光那边，再次把我一个人留在这里。我走向教室，知道剑介和东治会在那里。这是我唯一能依靠的事，也是我总能猜对的事。

"Hey Shinji!" like I said, reliability. Kensuke called me over to where him and Toji were sitting.  
"嘿，真嗣！" 就像我说的，可靠。剑介叫我去他和东治坐的地方。

"Kensuke… you know that I still owe you from yesterday…" he went pale, "Not now though, not in front of a woman…" across the room sat Rei in her normal position; her head resting on her hand looking out the window. She actually looked pretty cute when she was like that.  
"剑介……你知道我昨天还欠你人情……" 他脸色发白，"不过现在不行，不能在女人面前……" 坐在教室另一边的丽，像往常一样坐在那里，头靠在手上，望着窗外。她那样看起来真的很可爱。

"Oh ah ah ah ah!" huh? "Oh! Oh!" what the hell? "Oh! Oh!" where was that coming from? "Drowning deep in my sea of loathing, broken your servant I kneel, will you give it to me?" I look back at Toji and see him talking to Kensuke. Where the hell was this music coming from? I look back at Rei, " "It seems that what's left of my human side is slowly changing… in me… will you give it to me?" was that coming from Rei? It sounded like the music from when we were in the… entry plugs… were these her thoughts?  
"哦啊啊啊啊啊！" 嗯？"哦！哦！" 搞什么鬼？"哦！哦！" 这声音从哪儿来的？"在我憎恨的海洋中深陷，破碎的仆人我跪下，你会给我吗？" 我回头看向真嗣，见他在和真希说话。这音乐到底是从哪儿来的？我又看向丽，" "我人性的一面似乎正在慢慢改变……在我体内……你会给我吗？" 那是丽的声音吗？听起来像是我们在……插入栓里……时的音乐……这些是她的想法吗？

"Earth to Shinji!" Toji hits me on the back of the head, "Quit staring at Ayanami for one second and talk to us!" I turn to see Kensuke about to laugh his ass of and Toji smiling, "I thought you had a thing for Asuka, or are you just scoping?" man I hate it when he brings up Asuka.  
"地球呼叫真嗣！" 真嗣拍了下我的后脑勺，"别盯着绫波看一秒钟了，跟我们聊聊！" 我转头看到真希似乎要笑出声来，真嗣笑着说，"我还以为你对明日香有意思呢，还是只是在观察？" 我讨厌他提起明日香。

"I don't like Asuka! I told you!" they both just stare at me smiling.  
"我不喜欢明日香！我告诉过你了！" 他们俩只是微笑着盯着我。

"Who could blame him? She's hot, but I wouldn't admit to liking her," there it is again! That was Toji! What the hell did Akagi do to me?  
“谁会怪他呢？她很火辣，但我不会承认喜欢她，”又是这句！那是冬二！碇到底对我做了什么？

"NERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERV," Kensuke? Just then the bell rings and students come flooding into the small room. As Asuka 'said', damn school.  
“NERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERVNERV，”是真嗣？就在这时，铃声响起，学生们涌入这个小房间。正如明日香‘所说’，该死的学校。

"Okay students, you will be learning about the reproductive system today, as I said yesterday." I missed that! My computer beeps and I open it to see a message waiting for me.  
“好了，同学们，今天我们将学习生殖系统，正如我昨天所说的。”我错过了！我的电脑发出哔哔声，我打开它，看到一条消息在等着我。

You have entered room 'WHEN?'  
你已进入房间‘何时？’

**SPORTman**- when did this happen? He didn't say anything about this!

**REDcutie-** No! I mean after Pen-Pen took a crap in my bed! Shinji slept on the sofa! Pervert!  
REDcutie- 不！我是说在 Pen-Pen 在我床上拉屎之后！真嗣睡在沙发上了！变态！

I look over at Asuka and see her bright red with embarrassment. I've never seen her blush like that before.  
我转头看向明日香，她满脸通红，尴尬得不得了。我以前从没见过她这样脸红。

"Not that I'd mind sleeping with him…" I hear Asuka's voice, but she's not moving her lips… wait… what was that?  
“并不是我不想和他一起睡……”我听到明日香的声音，但她并没有动嘴唇……等等……那是什么？

"TURN OFF THE FUCKING COMPUTERS!" we all slam them shut and sit up straight, now paying full attention to him, "Good little brats, now where was I? Oh yes, the female has two ovaries…" all I heard after that was 'blah, blah, blah', I was too focused on what Asuka just thought. I look back over at her still blushing.  
“把那些该死的电脑关掉！”我们齐刷刷地合上电脑，挺直腰板，全神贯注地听他说话，“乖孩子们，我刚才讲到哪儿了？哦对，女性有两个卵巢……”之后我只听到一连串的“blah, blah, blah”，我的注意力全在刚刚明日香的想法上。我回头再看她，她依旧满脸通红。

"Thank God! I got out of that one with a miracle!" she looks over at me staring at her and blushes, "He's looking right at me! Turn your head Asuka, pretend you didn't see him!" I found that it was impossible to look away myself. We just stared at each other, each with a blush on their face, "God… I can't look away… what is he doing?" we still stared at each other. After I heard her say that, I smiled enough for her to notice, "Why is he smiling? Is my shirt undone?" she glanced down and brought her attention back to me, "He's… smiling at me? Shinji… do you like me or not? I just can't tell anymore…" she frowned slightly. I nod and she goes wide eyed, "What the hell? Did he just… no…" I raise my eyebrows and nod a little harder, "He's messing with my head!" she's not getting it, is she? I grab a pencil and paper and write down, 'Yes I do', hoping that she'll believe me. This was way easier then actually telling her! I hold up the piece of paper and wink, "GOOD LORD!!!!!" okay… that wasn't a thought…  
谢天谢地！我奇迹般地逃过了那一劫！她瞥了我一眼，见我盯着她，脸颊泛红，“他正盯着我看！转过头去，明日香，假装没看见他！”我发现自己也难以移开视线。我们就这样彼此凝视，脸上都带着红晕，“天啊…我无法移开目光…他在做什么？”我们依旧对视着。听到她这么说后，我微笑到足以让她察觉，“他为什么笑？是我的衬衫没扣好吗？”她低头看了一眼，又把注意力转回我身上，“他…在对我笑？真嗣…你到底喜不喜欢我？我已经搞不清楚了…”她微微皱眉。我点头，她瞪大了眼睛，“搞什么鬼？他刚刚是…不…”我挑了挑眉，更用力地点头，“他在捉弄我！”她还没明白，是吧？我抓起一支笔和一张纸，写下，‘是的，我喜欢你’，希望她能相信我。这可比直接告诉她容易多了！我举起那张纸并眨眼，“天哪！！！！”好吧…那不是个想法…

"I know, and guess what? It happens every month Miss Souryu!" the whole class bursts out laughing. The teacher smiles for once and goes back to the board. I put a finger on my lips and look up at the board. There… I did it. Months of planning, and all I had to do was a sync test… of course it was that easy!  
"我知道，猜猜怎么着？每个月都会发生一次，Souryu 小姐！" 全班哄堂大笑。老师难得地笑了笑，回到黑板前。我用手指轻触嘴唇，抬头看向黑板。就这样…我做到了。数月的策划，而我所要做的只是一个同步测试…当然，就是这么简单！

Right After The Last Bell – Outside  
最后一声铃响后 – 校外

"What the hell was that Ikari? Were you trying to give me an ulcer?" we were walking down the street and away from the school, "Why did you hold up that sign? What was that yes for?" she still didn't know!  
"碇，你到底在搞什么鬼？你是想让我得胃溃疡吗？" 我们走在街上，远离学校，"你为什么要举那个牌子？那个'是'是什么意思？" 她还是一头雾水！

"You know that thing that Akagi did that let us read minds or something? I can still do it!" she laughs into the air as always.  
"你知道赤木做的那个让我们能读心或者什么的吗？我现在还能做到！" 她一如既往地对着空气笑道。

"You need to lay off the sugar Third, seriously," I put an arm out and stopped her from walking, "What the hell are you doing?!"  
"你得少吃点糖了，第三，说真的，" 我伸出一只手臂拦住她，"你到底在搞什么鬼？！"

"Hold on," I look into her eyes.  
"等等，" 我注视着她的眼睛。

"For the love of God, move your arm! You're touching my…" her thought stopped.  
"看在上帝的份上，挪开你的胳膊！你碰到了我的……"她的思绪戛然而止。

"Touching your what?" I look at my arm and see it resting on her breasts, "CRAP! Sorry!" she stood there wide eyed as I take my arm back, "S-See?" she continued to stare at me with wide eyes.  
"碰到了什么？"我看着自己的手臂，发现它正搭在她的胸部上，"糟糕！对不起！"她站在那里瞪大了眼睛，我赶紧收回手臂，"看吧？"她继续用那双大眼睛盯着我。

"So… you heard what I said…?" I nod, still coming off of the affect of what just happened, "I'm going to kill Akagi!" she grabs my wrist and drags me to NERV, "She better be able to fix this!" it's not like I cared, I already got what I wanted.  
"所以……你听到了我说的话……？"我点点头，仍未从刚才的冲击中缓过神来，"我要杀了赤城！"她抓住我的手腕，拽着我向 NERV 走去，"她最好能解决这个问题！"我倒是不怎么在意，我已经得到了我想要的。

NERV Akagi's Office NERV 赤城办公室

"Asuka, don't make up stories, I'm not in the mood," who didn't see that coming?  
“明日香，别编故事了，我没心情，”谁没预料到这个？

"I'm not lying! Shinji, show her! he just got done doing it to me!" with a sigh, I look into her eyes.  
“我没撒谎！真嗣，给她看！他刚对我做了那事！”我叹了口气，凝视着她的眼睛。

"You're thinking of my father. You have a date tonight and you will be wearing a black dress with fishnet and you will be bringing con-" she leaped up and covered my mouth. Asuka busts out laughing, and so do I.  
"你在想我父亲。你今晚有个约会，你会穿一件黑色带渔网的衣服，还会带上避-" 她跳起来捂住了我的嘴。明日香爆发出笑声，我也跟着笑了。

"Okay! I get it! I'll try to get it off! Just shut up!" she takes off her hands from my face and falls back into her chair, "Come with me, I'll run a few tests and try to get this off…" so, my father and her are dating, huh?  
"好吧！我明白了！我会试着把它弄掉！别说了！" 她把手从我脸上拿开，跌坐回椅子上，"跟我来，我做几个测试，试着把它弄掉…" 这么说，我父亲和她正在约会，嗯？

"And you will be bringing a condom…"  
"而且你会带上一个避孕套…"

Entry Plug – One Hour Later  
插入栓 – 一小时后

"I think I got it! Shinji, try and read Asuka's mind," Ritsuko hides her face and leaves Asuka alone on the screen. I couldn't read it… crap! I was just starting to have some fun with it!  
"我想我明白了！真嗣，试试读取明日香的心思，" 律子捂住脸，让明日香独自留在屏幕上。我读不出来……该死！我刚开始觉得有点意思呢！

"I can't… can I go home now?" she sighs and presses a button, popping my plug open, "You're so strict, I can't even read minds without getting yelled at!" I was joking as I crawled out of the LCL. I walk to the locker room and change back into my school uniform. Sure, I was going to miss that, but I got plenty! I walk out of the locker room and see Asuka staring at the floor, apparently waiting for me.  
"我做不到……我现在可以回家了吗？" 她叹了口气，按下按钮，弹开了我的插入栓，"你太严格了，连读心术都不让用，还要被骂！" 我边开玩笑边从 LCL 中爬出来。我走到更衣室，换回校服。当然，我会想念这些的，但我已经体验够了！我走出更衣室，看到明日香盯着地板，显然是在等我。

"Shinji… I'm sorry about what I sai- thought… were you joking about the yes?" she was still staring at the ground and blushing.  
"真嗣… 关于我之前说的那些话…我…我以为你在开玩笑…你是认真的吗？" 她依旧盯着地面，脸颊泛红。

"Well… no, I wasn't…" her head pops up and she looks at me, slightly grinning.  
"嗯… 不，我不是在开玩笑…" 她的头突然抬起，略带笑意地看着我。

"But… how?" what did she mean 'how'?  
"但是… 怎么会？" 她说的'怎么会'是什么意思？

"Well… I guess because of your personality. I just like how confident you are… kinda corny huh?" I can feel my cheeks on fire, "I don't even know what I'm saying here!" I force a fake laugh.  
"嗯…我想是因为你的性格吧。我就是喜欢你的自信…有点老套，对吧？" 我能感觉到我的脸颊火辣辣的，"我甚至不知道自己在说什么！" 我强装笑颜，发出一声假笑。

"So… um…" a long, awkward pause.  
"那么…呃…" 一阵漫长而尴尬的停顿。

"Asuka?" she looked up to my face with almost begging eyes, "Would… you like to go to the movies with me? Maybe on Sunday?" there… I did it… I prepare myself for rejection, even though I heard what she thought.  
"明日香？" 她抬起头，用近乎恳求的眼神看着我，"你…愿意和我一起去看电影吗？或许在周日？" 我…我做到了…我做好了被拒绝的准备，尽管我听到了她的心声。

"Yeah… yeah, I'd like that…" I knew it… wait…  
"是啊…是啊，我愿意…" 我就知道…等等…

"R-Really?" she had a slight blush on, and I knew damn well my face was red too. She smiled slightly and nodded. I couldn't believe this, was she really saying yes?  
"真-真的吗？" 她的脸颊微微泛红，我也清楚自己的脸肯定红透了。她微微一笑，点了点头。我简直不敢相信，她真的答应了吗？

"As long as I get to pick the movie!" always in control… probably the thing that annoyed me the most, yet also attracted me to her. With a smile, we begin to walk again. After a few minutes of silence, I feel a warm embrace on my hand. I look down to see her fingers laced with mine. She kept her view forward, but I did see a small smile.  
"只要我能选电影！" 总是掌控全局…这大概是我最烦她的地方，却也是吸引我的原因。她笑着，我们又开始走。沉默了几分钟后，我感到一只温暖的手握住了我的手。我低头一看，她的手指与我的紧紧相扣。她目光依旧直视前方，但我确实看到了一丝微笑。

Misato's Crib – A Few Minutes Later  
美里的小窝 – 几分钟后

That walk was quiet, but one of the best we've had. Not only was she my first girlfriend, I knew that she wasn't just teasing me. I open the door and let her in, when she enters, she busts out laughing.  
那段路很安静，但却是我们走过的最好的一段。她不仅是我的第一个女朋友，我还知道她不是在逗我玩。我打开门让她进去，她一进门就忍不住笑了起来。

"Squawk-y! Squawk-y! Squawk-y!" Pen-Pen followed along with the chanting Jerry Springer audience.  
“嘎嘎！嘎嘎！嘎嘎！” 企鹅潘-潘跟着杰瑞·斯普林格观众一起起哄。

"Are you going to do that again?" I look him in his blood-shot eyes. He has a crazy smile on and his feathers are in shambles. He shakes his head furiously and I take off the tape. He instantly runs to his cooler with arms flailing and screaming the whole way, "I doubt that he will pull anything like that again." She wiped a tear of laughter from her eye, "I'll go throw your sheets in the laundry, I'll be right back," I walk off into the laundry room. Maybe enduring all of the torture was worth it, maybe for once my work actually paid off. And hell, what a pay off! When I finish putting the sheets in, I walk back out to see her sitting on the sofa watching TV. Actually feeling courageous, I walk over and sit next to her.  
"你还要再来一次吗？" 我直视着他布满血丝的眼睛。他脸上挂着疯狂的笑容，羽毛凌乱不堪。他猛烈地摇头，我便撕下了胶带。他立刻挥舞着手臂，一路尖叫着跑向他的冷却器，"我怀疑他不会再搞这种事了。" 她擦去笑出的眼泪，"我去把你的床单扔进洗衣机，马上回来，" 我走向洗衣房。或许忍受所有的折磨都是值得的，也许我的工作终于有了回报。天哪，这回报真是太棒了！当我把床单放好后，走回客厅，看到她正坐在沙发上看电视。真的鼓起勇气，我走过去坐在她旁边。

"You know, you didn't have to be so stiff. Loosen up! Just relax!" she hits the back of the sofa with her fist… shit! The sofa folds up, trapping both of us. Unlike last night though, this was… uncomfortable, to say the least. Both of us had our knees on either side of out head with our faces buried into the fabric of the sofa, "You… have got… to be fucking kidding me!" Asuka yells into the sofa.  
"你知道，你不必这么僵硬。放松点！放轻松！" 她用拳头敲打沙发的靠背……该死！沙发折叠起来，把我们俩困在里面。不过，与昨晚不同，这次……至少可以说是不舒服。我们俩的膝盖分别顶在头的两侧，脸埋在沙发的布料里，"你……一定是在……开我玩笑吧！" 明日香对着沙发大喊。

"Hope Misato gets home early… I gotta use the bathroom…" with her left hand, she lightly punched my ribs.  
"希望美里能早点回家……我得用洗手间……" 她用左手轻轻捶了捶我的肋骨。

"You'd better be joking!"  
"你最好是在开玩笑！"

NERV

At NERV, Misato was deep in battle. This was a climatic battle; good against evil, heaven against hell, God against Satan himself. She has no idea who or what this evil is, but all she knows is that it has to be beaten. Unfortunately, Misato was losing… bad.  
在 NERV，美里正陷入一场激烈的战斗。这是一场高潮迭起的对决；正义对抗邪恶，天堂对抗地狱，上帝对抗撒旦本身。她不知道这个邪恶是什么，但她知道必须击败它。不幸的是，美里正节节败退……情况很糟。

"Why won't you just die?!" the computer screen flashed 'Check Mate 56/0 try again?' she pressed a button and a new game started, "I will not leave until I beat your sorry ass!" this was – of course – impossible. Misato was going up against the MAGI, and getting her ass handed to her.  
“你为什么不干脆去死？！”电脑屏幕上闪现出‘将军 56/0 再试一次？’她按下一个按钮，新的一局开始了，“我不会离开，直到我打败你这可悲的家伙！”当然，这是不可能的。美里正与 MAGI 对抗，结果是被对方打得落花流水。

Misato's Crib – 9:00 PM  
美里的住所 – 晚上 9 点

"I'm… going to kill her! Where the hell is she? She was supposed to be home two hours ago!" by this time, my entire back has gone numb, all I can feel is my head and a small portion of my neck.  
"我要…杀了她！她到底在哪儿？她应该两小时前就到家的！" 到这时，我的整个背部已经麻木了，我能感觉到的只有头部和一小部分脖子。

"Sorry about this…" why was I apologizing? She hit the damned thing! "Hold on… try pushing out with your legs. Maybe we can get this open if we do it at the same time," I really wish I had thought of that earlier.  
"对此我很抱歉…" 我为什么要道歉？是她撞上了那该死的东西！"坚持住…试着用腿往外推。如果我们同时用力，也许能把这东西打开，" 我真希望自己早点想到这个办法。

"Whatever…" "随便吧…"

"Okay, on my count, one, two, three, push!" we both pushed on it, making the springs creek and whine, and slowly, the bottom went back down. It clicks in place and the sofa is back to normal, "Okay… I really… wish we had done… that earlier," we were both breathing hard after pushing it open. No wonder I couldn't get out on my own, it took all of our combined strength to get it open!  
"好，我数到三，一、二、三，推！" 我们俩一起用力，弹簧吱吱作响，慢慢地，底部降了回去。它咔嗒一声归位，沙发恢复正常，"好吧……我真的……希望我们能……早点这么做，" 我们俩推开后都喘着粗气。难怪我自己出不来，我们俩合力才把它打开！

"I'm going to kill her!" apparently she wasn't TOO out of breath, "Damn, when did she buy this thing, the seventeen hundreds? I'm sitting on the floor until she gets a new damn one!" we both leap off it, not wanting it to close again.  
"我要杀了她！" 显然她没那么喘不过气，"该死，她什么时候买的这玩意儿，十七世纪吗？我要坐在地板上，直到她买个新的来！" 我们俩都跳了下来，生怕它再关上。

"Well… it doesn't look like she's coming home any time soon, so do you just wanna order take out?" why was Misato so late?  
"嗯……看来她一时半会儿不会回家，要不我们点外卖吧？" 美里怎么这么晚还没回来？

Misato's Crib 美里的小窝

"Sure, might as well." Take out was about one third of the meals at this house, so we had just about every place on speed dial, "Order some ramen, I'm in the mood for it," as always.  
“当然，为什么不呢。”外卖大约占了这家里三分之一的食物，所以我们几乎把所有餐馆都设为了快速拨号，“点些拉面吧，我现在就想吃。”一如既往。

"Okay, just gimme a second," I pick up the phone to hear a loud, constant beeping, "Misato forgot to pay the damn phone bill again!"  
“好吧，给我点时间，”我拿起电话，却听到一阵持续的响声，“Misato 又忘了付电话费！”

Misato's Crib 美里的小窝

"Damnit! Now we have to walk!" in my eyes, that actually wasn't all that bad. Sure, it was dark and we had to walk half a mile to get some food, but my other side was screaming 'A moonlit walk with Asuka! Yes!' "Let me go grab my jacket…" she walked into her room and came back out wearing her red jacket.  
该死！现在我们得走路了！" 在我看来，这其实也没那么糟糕。当然，天很黑，我们得走半英里才能弄到吃的，但我的另一面却在欢呼：'和明日香一起在月光下散步！太棒了！' "让我去拿件夹克……" 她走进她的房间，出来时穿着她的红色夹克。

"You ready to go?" stupid question, but what was I supposed to say?  
准备好了吗？" 这问题真蠢，但我还能说什么呢？

"Yeah… Misato's going to get it, I swear on my life!" she was really pissed at her! I mean, I wasn't happy about it, but what could she have done? She didn't know that we were trapped.  
"“是啊……我发誓，美里要倒大霉了！”她真的对美里很生气！我是说，我也不高兴，但她能怎么办呢？她不知道我们被困住了。”

"Just don't kill her," I open the door and let her go first, "we still need a place to stay," she let out a small chuckle. I did it again! That's twice I've made her laugh! We started to walk down the street light lit… street… in silence. Damn, even being around her is fairly awkward now. Nothing came to mind as to what to say, and she sure as hell wasn't helping.  
"“别杀了她，”我打开门让她先走，“我们还需要个地方住，”她轻声笑了一下。我又做到了！这是第二次逗她笑了！我们开始走在街灯照亮的……街道上……沉默不语。该死，现在即使在她身边也相当尴尬。我想不出该说什么，而她当然也没帮忙。”

"Thanks… for taking me to dinner…" hell, I'll take it.  
"“谢谢……带我去吃饭……”见鬼，我接受这个感谢。”

"Don't worry about it. I just kinda feel bad, what is Misato going to eat?" she lightly slapped my chest.  
"别担心这个。我只是有点内疚，美里会吃什么呢？" 她轻轻拍了拍我的胸口。

"Let her eat what she can find, serves her right for coming home so late!" well, yeah, but she didn't deserve to not eat, "Fine! We can get an extra meal for her, okay? Is your conscious clear now?" it helped…  
"让她自己找吃的吧，谁让她这么晚回家！" 嗯，是没错，但她也不该饿肚子，"好吧！我们可以给她多准备一份，行了吧？你现在良心安了吗？" 这倒是让我好受些……

"Yeah, actually…" we finally get to the stand and take our seats, "What are you going to get? Let me guess, extra hot?" she laughed her sarcastic laugh.  
"是啊，确实……" 我们终于到了摊位前坐下，"你要点什么？让我猜猜，特辣的？" 她发出那带着讽刺的笑声。

"Like hell I will! I hate that stuff! I only had you make it because I knew Misato would do that! It still wasn't as bad as she made it out to be though." So I went out of my way for her, and it was a joke? Damn! A man in an apron walks up to us and smiles.  
"打死我也不喝！我讨厌那玩意儿！我让你做只是因为我知道美里会那么做！不过，还是没她说的那么糟糕。" 我特意为她做了这些，结果只是个笑话？该死！一个系着围裙的男人向我们走来，微笑着。

"What can I get the young couple, huh?" heh… it's funny because it's finally true!  
"年轻的情侣要点什么，嗯？"呵呵…真有趣，因为这终于成真了！

"First off, shut the hell up, and second, I'll have the shrimp ramen." He glares at her.  
"首先，闭嘴，其次，我要虾仁拉面。" 他瞪着她。

"Well excuse me for trying to be friendly. What will he be having?" note to self; do NOT tell anyone about us dating.  
"哎呀，原谅我试图友好些。他会点什么呢？" 心里提醒自己；千万别告诉任何人我们在交往。

"Uh… I'll have the beef… thanks," he mumbled something and walked off to make our dinners, "You know Asuka, he was just joking… I take it I'm not allowed to tell anyone at school?" she looks over at me and smiles THAT smile.  
"呃…我要牛肉…谢谢，" 他咕哝着什么，走开去准备我们的晚餐，"你知道吗，明日香，他只是在开玩笑…我猜在学校里我不能告诉任何人？" 她朝我这边看过来，露出了那个笑容。

"Do what you want, when I've made up my mind, I really don't get ashamed of it. Just know that I will kill anyone that makes fun of us, so be sure to tell your stooge friends that!" that was unexpected! So I can actually tell people… nice…  
"随你便，我一旦下定决心，就真的不会感到羞愧。只是要知道，我会干掉任何取笑我们的人，所以一定要告诉你的那些跟班朋友！" 这倒是出乎意料！所以我真的可以告诉别人…不错…

"Will do!" we both laugh as the man walks back up and sets down two bowls.  
“好的！”我们俩都笑了，那人走回来放下两碗。

"Here ya go, enjoy… brats…" he was monotone now, and he mumbled the last part.  
“给你们，慢慢享用……小鬼们……”他的语气变得单调，最后那部分几乎是咕哝出来的。

"Thanks prison-bitch…" Asuka got the last word! I don't think he heard it though, "Whatever, I'm here to enjoy myself… I'll let it go for now," thank God! I thought she was about to kill him! She begins to gorge on her meal, damn near inhaling it!  
“谢谢你，监狱婊子……”明日香抢到了最后一句！不过我觉得他没听见，“算了，我来这里是享受的……暂时不计较了，”谢天谢地！我还以为她要宰了他呢！她开始狼吞虎咽地吃她的饭，几乎是在吞咽！

"You were really hungry, huh?" she looks up at me with noodles still hanging from her mouth. She sucked them up and swallowed, "Didn't you eat lunch?" I still haven't eaten mine yet…  
"你真的很饿，是吧？" 她抬头看着我，嘴里还挂着面条。她吸了进去，咽下后说，"你没吃午饭吗？我还没吃我的呢……

"Well yeah, but Hikari forgot hers, so I gave her half of mine. Ya know, Toji really needs to make a move quick. Hikari's losing interest," wait… losing? She had an interest?  
"嗯，是的，但光忘了带她的，所以我分了一半给她。你知道，户次真的得快点行动了。光已经快没兴趣了，"等等……没兴趣？她原来有兴趣吗？

"Really? Should I talk to him?" I take my first bite of ramen, then realize I was quite hungry too. "Should we try and hook them up?" this idea actually appealed to me. Maybe Toji wouldn't be such a jerk if he had her.  
"真的吗？我应该和他谈谈吗？" 我吃了第一口拉面，然后意识到自己也很饿。"我们应该试着撮合他们吗？"这个主意其实挺吸引我的。也许有了她，户次就不会那么混蛋了。

"That won't be hard, just get him to ask her out. She'll say yes, I can guarantee it. Wanna hear something funny? The thing that attracts her to him is his 'sensitive side'! Have you ever seen that in him? EVER?" hell no! I doubt he even HAS a sensitive side!  
"那不难，只要让他约她出去就行了。她肯定会答应的，我敢打包票。想听个好笑的吗？她被他吸引的原因是他的‘敏感一面’！你见过他有这种时候吗？从来没见过！我怀疑他根本就没有敏感的一面！

"No, but as long as Hikari thinks he has one, let her. I'll try to get him to ask her out, but no promises," we both take the last bite of food.  
"不，但只要光认为他有，就让她这么想吧。我会试着让他约她出去，但不保证，" 我们俩都吃完了最后一口食物。

"Okay, maybe Hikari won't stick to me like a lost puppy if they date," I pull out the money and throw it on the counter. "Anyway, thanks for dinner. I liked it," so did I… it was the first time we actually ate a meal without bickering.  
"好吧，也许他们约会后，光就不会像迷路的小狗一样黏着我了，" 我掏出钱扔在柜台上。"总之，谢谢你的晚餐。我很喜欢，" 我也是…这是我们第一次真正地吃饭而没有争吵。

"I'm glad." We began to walk back to Misato's hand in hand…  
"我很高兴。" 我们开始手牵手走回美里小姐那里……

A/N- Near the end it lost the humor, but the relationship grew. Before any of you say anything, I know that I didn't show any sign of Shinji liking her before this, and I know that Rei should be dead after the Third Impact. What will become of this new relationship? Will Shinji tell everyone at school? Find out in the next chapter; School Trouble, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记- 接近结尾时失去了幽默感，但关系却加深了。在你们提出任何意见之前，我知道在这之前我没有表现出真嗣喜欢她的任何迹象，我也知道在第三次冲击后零应该已经死了。这段新关系将会如何发展？真嗣会告诉学校里的每个人吗？下一章chapter《校园风波》中揭晓，在此之前，继续保持吧！

### Chapter 4: School Trouble

Misato's Crib – 4:00 AM  
美里的小窝 – 凌晨 4:00

"DAMNIT! Why the hell does the MAGI have to be so smart?!?!" I leap out of bed, heart pounding as Misato came storming through the door. I run out into the living room – still half asleep – and look at her red-face.  
“该死！为什么 MAGI 非要这么聪明？！！”我从床上跳起来，心跳加速，美里怒气冲冲地闯进门来。我半睡半醒地跑进客厅，看着她涨红的脸。

"Misato? Are you okay?" Asuka comes jetting out of her room full speed and fails to stop on time, sending her tripping into the sofa… guess what happens.  
"美里？你还好吗？" 明日香全速从她的房间冲出来，没能及时停下，结果一头栽进了沙发……猜猜发生了什么。

"God damnit! Get me out of here!" her upper body was pinned inside of the sofa and her legs flailed freely above her. I pull down the sofa and she gets up, then immediately glares at Misato, "Where the hell were you? Do you know what time it is?" Misato glared right back.  
"该死！把我弄出来！" 她的上半身被卡在沙发里，双腿在空中乱蹬。我把沙发拉开，她爬了起来，随即立刻瞪向美里，"你到底跑哪儿去了？你知道现在几点了吗？" 美里也回瞪过去。

"I was at work young lady! Excuse me for trying to feed and shelter you!" she was playing chess again…  
"我还在工作呢，小姑娘！原谅我努力给你提供食物和住所！" 她又在下棋了……

"Don't lie! You were playing chess all night again! You'll never beat the MAGI, get over it!" Misato was speechless for once. She rubbed the back of her head and smiled.  
"别撒谎了！你又是一整晚都在下棋！你永远赢不了 MAGI 的，接受现实吧！" 美里一时无言以对。她揉了揉后脑勺，笑了笑。

"I'm a little stubborn…" she let out a small laugh. Asuka just rolls her eyes and goes back to the room, slamming the door as she does. I had to get to bed too, it was a school night.  
"我有点固执……" 她轻声笑了出来。明日香只是翻了个白眼，回到房间，砰的一声关上门。我也得去睡觉了，明天还要上学。

"I'm going back to bed, good night Misato." I start to walk back to my room, but then I feel a tugging at my shirt.  
"我要回去睡觉了，晚安美里。" 我开始走回自己的房间，但突然感觉有人在拽我的衬衫。

"Hold on, I need to talk with you. May I ask what is happening between you and Asuka?" how the hell did she always do that?  
"等等，我需要和你谈谈。我能问一下你和明日香之间发生了什么吗？"她到底是怎么总能做到这一点的？

"I-I don't know what you mean… we just went to get dinner at a ramen stand…" I could feel my face on fire. She smiles and gets her normal Misato smirk, "W-What?" great, I'm stuttering.  
"我-我不知道你在说什么……我们只是去拉面摊吃了晚饭……"我能感觉到我的脸在发烧。她笑了笑，露出了她那典型的美里式的坏笑，"什-什么？"该死，我结巴了。

"Come on, spill it. Section 2 said they saw you two holding hands," stalkers, "now tell me what's going on. Are you two finally dating?" I just keep quite, "YOU ARE! I knew you'd get together eventually!" damn it… we'll never hear the end of this.  
"快说，别藏着掖着。第二课的人说他们看到你们俩牵手了，"真是些跟踪狂，"现在告诉我到底怎么回事。你们俩终于开始约会了吗？"我只是保持沉默，"你们真的在交往！我就知道你们迟早会在一起的！"该死……我们永远也摆脱不了这个话题了。

"Misato! Keep it down… she'll kill me!" I know that she said that she didn't care, but Misato was different.  
“美里！小声点……她会杀了我的！”我知道她说过她不在乎，但美里不一样。

"Fine…" she grabs my wrist and drags me out onto the balcony, "Now, tell me everything! I'm so excited about this!" now why was SHE excited?  
“好吧……”她抓住我的手腕，把我拖到阳台上，“现在，告诉我所有的事！我对此超级兴奋！”她为什么这么兴奋呢？

"Do we have to talk about this?" sure, I saw her as family, but this was just weird.  
“我们非得谈这个吗？”当然，我把她视为家人，但这感觉太奇怪了。

"Fine then, I'll ask Asuka," NO!  
"好吧，那我问明日香，"不！

"Hold on! I'll tell you!" damnit, there's no way out of this! "We are together… and we have a date… on Sunday…." Her eyes lit up and she grew an even bigger smile.  
"等等！我告诉你！"该死，这下逃不掉了！"我们在一起了……而且我们有个约会……在星期天……"她的眼睛亮了起来，笑容更加灿烂了。

"Awww! My little Shinji is growing up! Have you two kissed yet?" truthfully, I was hoping for that on Sunday!  
"哇哦！我的小真嗣长大了！你们俩接吻了吗？"老实说，我本来希望星期天能实现的！

"Well, no but-" she got wide eyes and cut me off.  
"哎，不，但是——" 她瞪大了眼睛，打断了我。

"No way! After what she wrote, I thought you two would have made out by now!" wrote? She read Asuka's diary! I wasn't the only that deserved to get thrown out of a window!  
"不可能！她写了那些之后，我还以为你们俩早该亲上了呢！" 写了什么？她看了明日香的日记！我可不是唯一一个该被扔出窗外的人！

"What… did she write?" curiosity killed the cat.  
"她……写了什么？" 好奇心害死猫。

"You can't tell her I told you, but she said that you had a nice butt!" WHAT?! No wonder she was staring at me in a plug suit! "Also, apparently you're quite the target around school. She wrote that girls are always talking about you." Okay… what else don't I know?  
"你不能告诉她是我告诉你的，但她说了你有个好看的屁股！" 什么？！难怪她穿着插头服时一直盯着我看！"而且，显然你在学校是个热门目标。她写道女生们总是在谈论你。" 好吧……还有什么是我不知道的？

"Okay, I think I've had enough… I'm going to bed…" simply out of embarrassment, I walk off to my room while she laughed. I had to admit though, I did have a burst in my ego because of that. So Asuka thinks I have a nice butt… well, her too!  
"好吧，我觉得我受够了……我要去睡觉……" 出于尴尬，我走向我的房间，而她在笑。不过我得承认，因为那件事，我的自尊心确实膨胀了一下。原来明日香也觉得我有个好看的屁股……嗯，她也是！

"Shinji? What are you still doing up?" I turn the corner and see Asuka up, "I thought you were going to bed…" her eyes were half shut and she looked simply exhausted.  
"真嗣？你怎么还没睡？" 我转过拐角，看到明日香还醒着，"我以为你要去睡觉了……" 她的眼睛半闭着，看起来非常疲惫。

"I am, I just had to talk with Misato," HAD to, "just go back to bed. We have school tomorrow." With a moan, she walked back into her room, and so did I.  
"我确实要，只是得和美里谈谈，"必须得，"你先回去睡吧。明天还得上学呢。"她呻吟一声，走回了自己的房间，我也跟着进去了。

Morning 早晨

"Oh, Shinji… Shinji… SHINJI!" I wake up to Asuka at my bedside yelling. I look up at her and see that she is already in her uniform and about to leave, "I'm giving you thirty seconds to get ready! Get your ass out of bed!" Asuka wasn't exactly a morning person in my opinion.  
"哦，真嗣……真嗣……真嗣！"我被明日香在床边大喊吵醒。我抬头看着她，发现她已经穿好了校服，正准备出门，"我给你三十秒准备！快起床！"在我看来，明日香可不是个喜欢早起的人。

"Oh… sorry…" I lug out of bed and go over to my closet, "Are you going to stay here or what?" I had a grin on, but because I was facing the wall, she couldn't see it.  
"哦…抱歉…" 我拖着身子起床，走向衣橱，"你打算留在这儿还是怎么着？" 我脸上带着笑意，但由于背对着墙，她看不见。

"Shut up!" she slams the door behind her. Like she ordered, I get dressed quickly and exit the room still tucking in my shirt. "It's about time! Hurry up, we're going to be late!" I grab my bag as we jet out the door.  
"闭嘴！" 她砰地一声关上门。像她命令的那样，我迅速穿好衣服，一边整理衬衫一边走出房间。"终于好了！快点，我们要迟到了！" 我抓起书包，我们冲出门去。

"Sorry for sleeping…" I look down at my watch to see exactly how late we were, "Asuka… school isn't for another hour…" why the hell did she wake me up and scare me half to death if we're this early? As we walked, she grabbed my hand.  
"抱歉睡过头了…" 我低头看手表，想知道我们到底迟到了多久，"明日香…学校还有一个小时才开始…" 既然这么早，她干嘛把我叫醒还吓得我半死？我们走着走着，她握住了我的手。

"What? You've never heard of some alone time? I thought we could spend some time together before school started. Sound good?" was Asuka being romantic? Wow… that's new! I never thought she would do this!  
"什么？你没听说过独处时光吗？我想在开学前一起度过一些时间。听起来不错吧？" 这是否意味着明日香在浪漫？哇…这可是新鲜事！我从没想过她会这么做！

"Sure… if you want to," I enjoyed this, actually out in public holding Asuka's hand. Sure, I'd be shunned if anyone saw us, but I really didn't care at the moment…  
"当然…如果你愿意的话，" 实际上我很享受这个，在公共场合牵着明日香的手。当然，如果有人看到我们，我可能会被排斥，但此刻我真的不在乎…

"NNNOOOO!!!!" I look back to see Toji standing wide eyed with a fallen Kensuke next to him. Of all the people to see this, why did it have to be them? "SHINJI! What happened to you?!?!?" Asuka looked back at me.  
"不——！！！" 我回头看到剑介站在那里，眼睛睁得大大的，旁边是倒下的真希波。偏偏是看到这一幕的人，为什么非得是他们？"真嗣！你怎么了？！？！" 明日香回头看着我。

"May I?" "我可以吗？"

"You may…" she released my hand and began to crack her knuckles.  
"你可以……" 她松开我的手，开始活动她的指关节。

"So… you think this is funny?" she gets that fire in her eye, "I'll give you ten seconds, nine, eight, ah screw it, ONE!" she ran full speed towards a cowering Toji and close-lines him to the floor. Now both of them were side by side on the floor, "Now, I believe you have something to say to us." She steps on Toji's chest.  
"所以……你觉得这很有趣？" 她的眼中燃起了怒火，"我给你十秒钟，九，八，啊，去他的，一！" 她全速冲向蜷缩着的 Toji，将他击倒在地。现在他们俩并排躺在地板上，"现在，我相信你有什么话要对我们说。" 她踩在 Toji 的胸口上。

"Nice… panties…" he was looking up her skirt and smiling.  
"真...性感...内裤..." 他正从她的裙下往上看，还笑着。

"Pervert!" she takes back her foot and kicks him in the groin, "Asshole!" she storms back to me with a red-with-anger face.  
"变态！" 她收回脚，朝他的下体踢去，"混蛋！" 她气得满脸通红，怒气冲冲地回到我身边。

"Um… I think you got him…" she once again starts to walk next to me, "You okay?" her face was still red!  
"嗯...我觉得你踢中他了..." 她再次开始走在我旁边，"你还好吗？" 她的脸依旧红扑扑的！

"No! People like that piss me off! Who cares who a person's dating? That's how rumors start!" well yeah, but she didn't have to do THAT, "I swear, they say one word at school and they DIE!" she would kill them too!  
"不！那种人真让我火大！谁在乎一个人在和谁约会？谣言就是这么开始的！" 是啊，但她也不必那么做，"我发誓，他们在学校说一个字，他们就死定了！" 她也会把他们干掉的！

"Do what you want, just don't get caught!" I finally got a small smile out of her.  
"想做什么就去做，只要别被抓到！" 我终于让她露出了一个小小的微笑。

Class 3-A – First Bell  
三年 A 班 – 第一声铃响

Luckily, Toji didn't say a word and Kensuke was still white as a ghost, so nobody knew… yet. I'm sure by the end of the day Toji would say something and the whole school would know.  
幸好，Toji 一言未发，Kensuke 依旧面色苍白，所以还没人知道……但估计到不了今天结束，Toji 就会说漏嘴，全校都会知道了。

"Okay… please be quiet…" the class instantly shut up, "Good, now, back to sex-ed…" he once again began to ramble on. Almost like clock-work, my computer beeps. I open it and enter the chat room.  
“好了……请大家安静……”教室立刻鸦雀无声，“很好，现在继续上性教育课……”他又开始滔滔不绝。几乎像上了发条一样，我的电脑发出提示音。我打开它，进入了聊天室。

All of the computer screens went black.  
所有的电脑屏幕都黑了。

"Stop chatting! Pay attention already! You know what? Just for that, pop quiz!" ah crap! "Get out a sheet of paper and answer my questions. ONE! What is the female reproductive organ?" well that was an easy start, "TWO! What is the male's?" I have no idea! Damn, this was going to be an easy grade! "THREE! How are babies made?" he does know we're in eighth grade, right? How are babies made… ummm… a stork? "FOUR! What is the name of the male sex cell?" egg! "Last one! In the third month of the fetus's development stage, what new body part do they grow?" okay, not so easy. So I got an A-, big deal. "Pencils down! Pass your papers forward!" the class does so silently. When Toji hands me his paper, I see a doodle of him beating on me. I look back at him, literally red with anger. Why was he mad? He got a yes! Hikari was all smiles though, she couldn't stop smiling!  
别聊天了！专心点！你知道吗？就因为这个，突击测验！" 糟糕！ "拿出一张纸，回答我的问题。第一题！女性的生殖器官是什么？" 这个简单， "第二题！男性的呢？" 我完全不知道！该死，这分数要泡汤了！ "第三题！婴儿是怎么来的？" 他知道我们是八年级吧？婴儿是怎么来的……呃……是鹳鸟送来的吗？ "第四题！男性性细胞叫什么？" 卵子！ "最后一题！胎儿发育的第三个月，他们长出了什么新身体部位？" 好吧，没那么简单。所以我得了个 A-，没什么大不了的。 "停笔！把试卷往前传！" 全班默默照做。当 Toji 递给我他的试卷时，我看到他在上面画了自己揍我的涂鸦。我回头看他，气得满脸通红。他为什么生气？他答对了啊！Hikari 倒是笑得合不拢嘴，她停不下来！

"I'm going to kill you…" he whispered to me.  
"我要杀了你……" 他对我低语。

"You got a yes! You should be happy!" I hear Hikari giggle a little. Hell, if I was in her point of view, I'd be laughing my ass of right now. The boy that has had a crush on her for God only knows how long just got a yes, and he's pissed… yeah, that makes sense.  
"你得到了肯定的答复！你应该高兴才对！" 我听到光笑了起来。见鬼，如果我是她的立场，我现在肯定会笑得前仰后合。那个暗恋她不知多久的男孩刚刚得到了肯定的答复，他却生气了……嗯，这说得通。

"Hey Toji!" Hikari took Toji's attention away from me and onto her, "I want to meet you outside during lunch, okay?" Hikari was making a move? Nice!  
"嘿，冬二！" 光把冬二的注意力从我身上转移到了她身上，"我想在午餐时间和你在外面见面，好吗？" 光在采取行动？不错！

"O-Okay…" his eyes were wide as he stared at her. You know, he always bragged about being so suave with the women, yet when he finally gets one to date him, he's more useless then Pen-Pen.  
"好…好的…" 他瞪大眼睛盯着她。你知道吗，他总是吹嘘自己在女人面前多么潇洒，可一旦真的有人愿意和他约会，他却比企鹅 Pen-Pen 还无用。

Lunch 午餐

"Asuka, we have to follow Toji and Hikari!" the class just went outside for lunch, and we were the last ones in the class, "She said that she wanted to talk with him… he got a yes!" her eyes went wide.  
"明日香，我们得跟着真嗣和美里！" 全班同学都出去吃午饭了，我们是班上最后两个，"她说想和他谈谈…他得到了肯定的答复！" 她的眼睛瞪得大大的。

"Already? I told you it was going to be easy! Hurry up! I don't want to miss this!" she ran out of the room and I followed soon after her. I wonder what she was going to say. Maybe something about his 'sensitive side'! when we get outside, we see them at a table together, so we sneak behind a nearby bush.  
已经？我告诉过你这很容易的！快点！我不想错过这个！" 她跑出了房间，我紧随其后。不知道她要说什么。可能是关于他的'敏感一面'！当我们出去时，看到他们坐在一张桌子旁，于是我们悄悄躲到附近的灌木丛后。

"Y-You need t-to talk with me?" he was blushing so hard! I saw a slight tint of pink on Hikari's face too, but not much.  
“你-你需要和我谈谈吗？”他脸红得厉害！我也注意到光的脸颊上微微泛起了粉色，但不是很明显。

"Yeah… was Shinji serious? Are you really asking me out?" she thought I was kidding?  
“是啊…真嗣是认真的吗？你真的在约我出去？”她以为我在开玩笑？

"Um… yeah…" he looked down at the table. Look up you idiot! Look at her FACE! "Sorry if it's kinda… stupid…" friggen idiot!  
"呃… 是的…" 他低头看着桌子。抬头啊，你这个白痴！看她的脸！"抱歉，如果这有点… 蠢…" 真是个笨蛋！

"Stupid? No, that's not stupid. What's stupid is that you took so long to do it! Why didn't you ask earlier?" was this Hikari?  
"蠢？不，那不蠢。蠢的是你花了这么长时间才做这件事！你为什么不早点问？" 这是光吗？

"I… thought that you'd say no… are you?" Let me spell this out for him. She. Said. Yes. You. Dumbass. Get it?  
"我… 以为你会拒绝… 你是吗？" 让我给他解释清楚。她。说。了。是。你。这个傻瓜。明白了吗？

"No! I want to, I just want to know why you never made a move before. You can't tell me Shinji never told you!" don't tell him I knew! He'll kick my ass! It was Asuka's fault! She told me not to tell him!  
"不！我想去，我只是想知道为什么你之前一直没行动。你不能告诉我真嗣从没告诉过你！"别告诉他我知道！他会揍我的！都是明日香的错！她让我别告诉他！

"He… knew? I'm going to kill him!" he finally looked up at her, "So… you DO want to go out with me? Really?" did she not just say that?  
"他……知道？我要杀了他！"他终于抬头看她，"那么……你真的想和我出去？真的吗？"她不是刚说过吗？

"Did I not just say that?" ha! "So Mr. Suzahara… where will you be taking me?" she had a long grin on her face. I swear, if he said the batting cages, I'll laugh my ass off. Just as he was about to answer, I hear a rustling in my backpack.  
"我不是刚说过吗？"哈！"那么铃原先生……你要带我去哪儿？"她脸上挂着长长的笑容。我发誓，如果他说去打棒球，我会笑掉大牙。就在他正要回答时，我听到我的背包里有动静。

"Um… movies?" I unzip it to see Pen-Pen holding 'Snow Sex' in his hands, "how about tomorrow?" that son of a bitch followed me to school again!  
"嗯……电影？" 我拉开拉链，看到 Pen-Pen 手里拿着《雪地情欲》，"明天怎么样？" 那个混蛋又跟着我到学校了！

"Is that Pen-Pen?" Asuka looked down into my back pack and her eybrow twitched, "What… is he reading?" she reaches inside and grabs him by the beak. She raises him – only by his beak by the way – and stare him in the eye, "So, it was you that brought the porn to school… do you know what you put Shinji through?" Pen-Pen's eyes were wide as he stared back at her, "Not so much to do now that I have you, huh?" she got a wicked smile on.  
"那是 Pen-Pen 吗？" 明日香低头看着我的背包，她的眉毛抽动了一下，"什么……他在读什么？" 她伸手进去，用喙抓住他。她把他——只用喙抓住他——举起来，直视他的眼睛，"所以，是你把色情杂志带到学校的……你知道你让真嗣经历了什么吗？" Pen-Pen 瞪大了眼睛回望着她，"现在我抓住你了，没什么可做的了，嗯？" 她露出了邪恶的笑容。

"That sounds great! What are we going to see?" Pen-Pen struggled under her grip.  
"听起来不错！我们要看什么？" Pen-Pen 在她手中挣扎着。

"You can't get away. Now, say sorry to Shinji," she turned him so he faced me.  
"你逃不掉的。现在，向真嗣道歉，"她把他转过来面对我。

"Mmmmm!" he tried to let out a 'squawk', but all that came out was a loud hum.  
"嗯嗯嗯！"他试图发出一声"嘎"，但出来的只是一阵响亮的哼声。

"Okay, I'm going to let go of you, but you won't make a sound, okay?" he nodded slightly.  
"好吧，我要放开你了，但你不会出声的，好吗？"他微微点头。

"How about March of the Penguins?" Asuka released him and his arms started to flail as he screamed. He ran out of the bush, jumped onto the table Hikari and Toji were at, and continued running down the street. "Never mind…"  
"《帝企鹅日记》怎么样？" 明日香松开手，他的手臂开始乱挥，尖叫着。他从灌木丛中冲出来，跳上光和剑介所在的桌子，沿着街道继续狂奔。"算了……"

After School – On The Walk Home  
放学后 —— 回家的路上

"Okay, so for once Pen-Pen didn't get in the way, but he almost got us caught! I swear, tomorrow I'm making him watch Oprah!" yet another show he hated.  
"好吧，这次 Pen-Pen 没有碍事，但他差点让我们被发现！我发誓，明天我要让他看奥普拉！" 又一个他讨厌的节目。"

"Whatever, I'm just glad they're finally together… couples are popping up all over, huh?" she wraps an arm around my shoulder, "Looks like Kensuke is the only one left… wanna try and hook him up with a girl? Or is it a boy? I keep on forgetting. That'll be a challenge, won't it?" like that'll ever happen. Hell, he could probably walk up to some whore and give her a million dollars and end with her saying something like 'Hell no! I'd rather do Gendo!' I can really see that happening.  
"“管他呢，我反正挺高兴他们终于在一起了……到处都是成双成对的，是吧？”她用一只胳膊搂住我的肩膀，“看来只剩 Kensuke 了……想试试给他牵个红线吗？是女生还是男生？我老是记不清。那可是个挑战，不是吗？”像这种事怎么可能发生。见鬼，他可能随便找个妓女，甩给她一百万美元，结果她来句‘门都没有！我宁愿去伺候 Gendo！’我真觉得这事儿能发生。”

"Do you think that's even possible? I mean, he IS kinda annoying…" kinda? "Plus, can't we just enjoy what we already did?" can't we just enjoy each other?  
"“你觉得那有可能吗？我是说，他确实有点烦人……”有点？“再说，我们难道不能享受已经拥有的吗？”难道我们不能享受彼此吗？”

"Fine… but about their date, they're going to the movies too, what if we bump into them?" I doubt it. They were going to see some romance film, and we were going to see a horror.  
"“好吧……不过说到他们的约会，他们也要去看电影，万一碰上了怎么办？”我觉得不太可能。他们要看的是爱情片，而我们看的是恐怖片。”

"Don't worry about it. We're going there to have fun, not to worry about them." Having fun? Dumbass!  
"别担心这个。我们去那儿是为了开心，不是为了担心他们。"开心？傻瓜！

"You know, you got really pissed today. That was the first time you showed that you had balls!" ow… my pride…  
"你知道吗，你今天真的很生气。那是你第一次展现出你有种！"哎…我的自尊…

"Well I was pissed! You were too!" she's always pissed…  
"我确实很生气！你也一样！"她总是生气…

"Well, you know me!" told ya, "Plus, I gotta defend my man!" she grabs onto my arm and chuckles slightly, "So tell me, have you picked out a movie yet? You know I want horror, right?" what's new? Damn, just what happened this morning was horror!  
"哎，你了解我的！" 她告诉我，"再说了，我得保护我的男人！" 她抓住我的手臂，轻声笑道，"那么告诉我，你选好电影了吗？你知道我喜欢恐怖片，对吧？" 有什么新消息吗？该死，今早发生的事简直就是恐怖片！

"Well… there is one called The Suffering, I heard that it's pretty good. I think it's off an old game from a few years ago. The preview said that it was about a guy that supposedly killed his family, and got sent to prison. He doesn't remember anything, so as he fights his way through prison, he slowly remembers his past. Oh, also, he's fighting these creepy monsters. Sound good?" hell, the preview alone made me piss myself… note to self, bring extra underwear.  
"嗯…有一部叫《苦难》的，我听说很不错。好像是根据几年前的一款老游戏改编的。预告片说，这是一个男人被指控杀害了自己的家人，被送进监狱。他什么都不记得了，所以在监狱里挣扎求生时，他慢慢回忆起过去。哦，对了，他还在和那些可怕的怪物战斗。听起来不错吧？" 光是预告片就让我吓得尿裤子了…提醒自己，多带条内裤。

"Sure, sounds good." "当然，听起来不错。"

Gendo's Office 碇源堂的办公室

"Die!" a climatic battle was happening between Gendo and the forces of evil. For once in his life – Gendo thought – he might actually make it. He might actually make a difference in the world. For once in his life, he will be appreciated.  
"去死吧！" 一场高潮迭起的战斗正在碇源堂与邪恶势力之间展开。这一生中，碇源堂想，他或许真的能成功。他或许真的能在这个世界上留下自己的印记。这一生中，他终将得到认可。

"Get them, sir," his right hand man, Fuyutsuki, was at his side, rooting all the way for Gendo. _He has always been there for me,_ Gendo thought _I'm sorry Fuyutsuki… this might be it…_ "Um… sir?"  
"上吧，先生，" 他的得力助手，冬月，始终在他身旁，全力支持着碇源堂。他一直在我身边，碇源堂想，对不起，冬月……这可能是最后了…… "呃……先生？"

"What is it?!" "什么事？！"

"A Slayer is behind you…" in an instant, the screen went red, and Torque's head was sliced off.  
"身后有个 Slayer…" 刹那间，屏幕变红，Torque 的头颅被斩落。

"Damnit… your turn…" with a sweaty palm, Gendo hands over the chunk of plastic.  
"该死…轮到你了…" Gendo 满手是汗，递过那块塑料碎片。

Misato's Crib 美里的小窝

We were just now entering the apartment and sitting down to watch some TV. Out of nowhere, Misato come crashing through the door with a wide smile on her face.  
我们刚进公寓坐下准备看电视。突然，Misato 带着灿烂的笑容破门而入。

"Well, hello my young couple! Guess what just happened!" she scared the hell out of both of us! Why was she home so early?  
"哎呀，小两口，你们好啊！猜猜刚刚发生了什么！"她把我们俩吓得魂飞魄散！她怎么这么早就回家了？

"You finally quit drinking?"  
"你终于戒酒了？"

"You got your tubes tied?"  
"你做了输卵管结扎？"

"Another breast implant?"  
"又是一对假胸？"

"New shoes?" "新鞋子？"

"Wonder Girl is dead?" "神奇女孩死了？"

"You finally accepted that what happened to your father wasn't your fault, and finally stopped obsessing over the angels, thus becoming a better guardian, woman, and all around human being?" okay… I went a little too far…  
"你终于接受了你父亲的事情不是你的错，终于不再对天使们念念不忘，从而成为了一个更好的守护者、女人以及全面发展的人类？"好吧……我可能有点过头了……

"Okay smart asses, now you don't get to hear it. And by the way, Asuka," she leaned down in front of Asuka, "Just because you have a puny B plus cup, doesn't mean I have to…" uh… no comment…  
"好吧，聪明的家伙们，现在你们听不到了。顺便说一句，明日香，"她俯身在明日香面前，"仅仅因为你是个小 B 罩杯，并不意味着我必须……"呃……无可奉告……

"At least I'm still a virgin!" Asuka stood up and glared at her.  
"至少我还是个处女！"明日香站起来瞪着她。

"Yeah, and want to hear a horror story about that? It hurts like hell the first time!" Misato had a half-smile on.  
“是啊，想听个关于那的恐怖故事吗？第一次疼得要命！”美里脸上带着半笑。

"You'd know all about that, wouldn't you?!" Asuka, on the other hand, was red as a cherry and had her 'I'm going to kill you' look on.  
“你肯定很清楚，对吧？！”另一方面，明日香满脸通红，露出了“我要杀了你”的表情。

"I'm twenty-nine! Yeah I know about it! And I recommend you don't find out any time soon young lady!" um… me… to…  
"“我二十九岁了！当然知道！而且我建议你近期还是别体验为妙，小姑娘！”嗯……我……对……”

"Whatever… just tell us what happened!" Asuka falls back onto the sofa… fuck! "Misato, I swear to God, if you don't get a new sofa… I'll rip off Pen-Pen's b-"  
"随便啦…快告诉我们发生了什么！" 明日香往后一倒，瘫在沙发上…该死！"美里，我发誓，如果你不买个新沙发…我就把企鹅潘-潘的…"

"Squawk!!!" we all heard Pen-Pen scream from his cooler. Misato pulls down the seat and frees us from the crappy sofa.  
"嘎！！！" 我们都听到了潘-潘从他的冷却器里发出的尖叫。美里拉下座位，让我们摆脱了那张破沙发。

"I like this sofa! And I already told you, I'm not tellin'…" she put her hands on her hips and raised her nose, smiling slightly, "…" I could see her building up… "Me and Kaji are together again!" who didn't see that coming?  
"我喜欢这张沙发！而且我已经告诉过你了，我不会说的…" 她双手叉腰，微微昂起头，略带笑意，"…" 我能看出她在酝酿… "我和加持又在一起了！" 谁没料到这一点呢？

"So you slept with him?" Misato turned beat red! "So tell me, is he good in bed?" Asuka had a small smirk along with a raised eyebrow. Man, this was better then any movie we could see!  
"“所以你和他睡了？”美里脸红得像熟透的苹果！“那告诉我，他在床上表现如何？”明日香微微挑眉，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。天啊，这比我们能看的任何电影都精彩！”

"W-We didn't sleep… shutup!" she stormed off to her room. Me and Asuka had a good laugh at her reaction, and a faint cursing could be heard from her room.  
"“我们没……闭嘴！”她气冲冲地跑回自己的房间。我和明日香被她的反应逗得哈哈大笑，隐约还能听到她房间里传来的咒骂声。”

"You know, Shinji, I think I have an idea for after the movies tomorrow…" She had a mischievous look on her face. I… was fairly creeped out now…  
"“你知道吗，真嗣，我想到了明天电影之后的一个主意……”她脸上露出了狡黠的表情。我……现在感到相当不安……”

A/N- Okay, some serious slow points, but I'm trying. Anyway, now that Toji and Hikari are together, what do you think will happen? Will they stay together? What does Asuka have in mind? Could I possibly come up with worse questions? Find out in the next chapter; First Time, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记 - 好吧，有些情节确实拖得挺慢，但我在努力。总之，如今冬二和光已经在一起了，你们觉得接下来会发生什么呢？他们会一直在一起吗？明日香又在打什么主意？我还能提出更糟糕的问题吗？答案尽在下回分解《初体验》，在此之前，继续加油吧！

### Chapter 5: First Time

Misato's Crib – That Night – 6:00 PM  
美里的小窝 – 那个夜晚 – 下午 6:00

"Hey Shinji!" I hear Misato yell from her room – where, by the way, she has been all day, "Can you come here for a second? I need to talk with you," me and Asuka were just watching TV sense we got home, so I was basically bored out of my mind.  
“嘿，真嗣！”我听到美里从她的房间里喊道——顺便说一句，她一整天都待在那里，“你能过来一下吗？我有话要和你谈，”我和明日香刚回家就在看电视，所以我简直是无聊透顶。

"Yeah, coming," carefully, I get up off the sofa and head for Misato's room. As always, I knock on the door before entering.  
"来了，" 我小心翼翼地从沙发上起身，朝美里小姐的房间走去。一如既往，我在进门前先敲了敲门。

"I already said to come here!" I take that as an okay and open the door. She was lying on her back on the bed reading a newspaper. How does she live in this mess? Food cans, clothes, paper, and a few things I'd rather not look at were scattered all over to room, "Okay, listen, Kaji is coming over tonight, and I need you to keep Asuka in check. I'm ordering the food, so you don't have to cook. Just make sure Asuka doesn't screw this up, okay?" like I didn't have my hands full already!  
"我已经说过让你进来了！" 我当作是允许，便打开了门。她正仰躺在床上读着报纸。她是怎么在这堆乱七八糟中生活的？食物罐头、衣物、纸张，还有些我宁愿不去看的东西散落一地，"好了，听着，加持今晚要过来，我需要你看好明日香。我会订外卖，所以你不用做饭。只要确保明日香别搞砸了，好吗？" 好像我手头还不够忙似的！

"Well… I could try, but I can't promise anything…" surprisingly, I get an idea, "What's in it for me?" she went wide eyed.  
"嗯……我可以试试，但不能保证……" 出乎意料地，我灵机一动，"我有什么好处？" 她瞪大了眼睛。

"Um… I… huh… well, what do you want?" putty in my hands!  
"呃…我…嗯…好吧，你想要什么？" 任我摆布！

"Help with Asuka. I have no idea what to do tomorrow at the movies… any ideas?" she smiles wide, "Without teasing me?" the smile disappears.  
"帮帮明日香。我完全不知道明天看电影该怎么做…有什么建议吗？" 她笑得很开怀，"不取笑我？" 笑容消失了。

"You're no fun! Fine, I'll help. For one, what movie are you going to see? Romance? A chick-flick? Comedy?"  
"你真没趣！好吧，我会帮忙的。首先，你们要看什么电影？爱情片？女性电影？喜剧？"

"Horror… The Suffering…" she began to laugh, "What's so funny?! I thought you said you weren't going to make fun of me!" she wipes a tear from her eye.  
"恐怖…痛苦…"她开始笑起来，"有什么好笑的？！我以为你说过不会取笑我！"她擦去眼角的泪水。

"Sorry… it's just that… it's so predictable! You do know that you're going to watch a guy shoot the heads off of monsters for three hours, right? Let me guess, Asuka is the one that wanted to see a horror?" embarrassed, I nod slightly, "I knew it! Okay… sorry… I'll stop… now that you are watching THAT, chances are she'll be clingy afterwards. For some reason, women are always all over their date after a horror, so try and act casual. Don't be that normal 'Don't touch me!' boy you are. Of you play your cards right, you might even get a little smooch!" did she have to use that word? Misato just loved to torture us, didn't she?  
"抱歉…只是…太可预料了！你知道你要看三个小时一个男人爆头怪物，对吧？让我猜猜，是明日香想看恐怖片？"我尴尬地点点头，"我就知道！好吧…抱歉…我不说了…既然你现在要看那个，看完后她很可能会黏着你。不知为何，女人看完恐怖片后总是会紧贴着约会对象，所以尽量表现得自然些。别做那个平常的'别碰我！'男孩。如果你表现得好，说不定还能得到一个吻！"她非得用那个词吗？美里就是喜欢捉弄我们，不是吗？

"Um… thanks… I think…" I start to walk out of the room, obviously blushing.  
"嗯…谢谢…我想…"我开始走出房间，显然脸红了。

"Hey! Don't forget about your end of the deal!" with a wave, I head back out to the living room.  
“嘿！别忘了我们的协议！”我挥了挥手，回到客厅。

"Hey Shinji, what'd Misato want?" carefully, I sit down next to her.  
“嘿，真嗣，美里找你什么事？”我小心翼翼地坐在她旁边。

"Nothing, but Kaji's coming over for dinner… try and behave, okay?" might as well come right out and say it, right? Wrong. Very, very, VERY wrong. She glares over at me and gets that fire in her eyes.  
“没什么，只是加持要来吃晚饭……尽量表现得规矩点，好吗？”直截了当地说出来，对吧？错。大错特错。她瞪了我一眼，眼中燃起了怒火。

"What is that supposed to mean?! Are you calling me rude?! Asshole!" did she just… wait… I'm confused now…  
"那是什么意思？！你在说我粗鲁吗？！混蛋！"她刚刚是……等等……我现在糊涂了……

"No! I'm not saying that! I'm saying that Misato is really happy about this, so we should both try and behave around him, okay?" she calms down slightly and gets a wicked smirk… aw crap!  
"不！我不是那个意思！我是说美里对此真的很高兴，所以我们俩都应该尽量在他面前表现得得体，好吗？"她稍微平静下来，露出了一个狡黠的笑容……糟糕！  
"Okay, sure, but I want something in return." Why is it that I had to do it? Misato's the one that wanted her to behave! Maybe I should just tell her… nah, then I'll have two women on me; one hormonal and the other vengeful.  
"好吧，当然可以，但我想要点回报。"为什么非得是我来做这件事？明明是美里希望她表现得体！也许我应该告诉她……算了，那样我就会有两位女士缠着我；一个情绪化，另一个怀恨在心。

"Um… okay… what is it?" she wraps her arms around my neck and whispers in my ear.  
"嗯…好吧…什么事？" 她用双臂环住我的脖子，在我耳边低语。

"I want… you…" good lord!  
"我想要…你…" 天哪！

"Asuka… I don't think we should," I swear, sometimes I can be the biggest dumbass in the world. With her arms still around me, she crawled over me, ending with her knees on either side of mine.  
"明日香…我觉得我们不该这样，" 我发誓，有时候我真是世界上最蠢的人。她的手臂还环抱着我，她爬到我身上，最后双膝跪在我的两侧。

"Come on… it'll be fun, and I know you want too…" was this Asuka? This had to be a prank! "Why not?" she was still whispering in my ear. Just then, Misato walks out fo her room.  
“来嘛…会很有趣的，我知道你也想…” 这是不是明日香？这肯定是个恶作剧！“为什么不呢？” 她还在我耳边低语。就在这时，美里从她的房间走了出来。

"Whoa! Don't do that HERE! Make out somewhere else!" crap…  
“哇！别在这儿做那种事！换个地方亲热去！” 该死…

"That's what I wanted, right there…" so it was a prank! Thankfully, it wasn't on me! In fact, I was on the winning side for once! "Oh Shinji! That's so good!" okay… not funny anymore… now she was just pushing it!  
“我就想要这样…” 果然是个恶作剧！谢天谢地，不是针对我的！事实上，我这次站在了胜利的一方！“哦，真嗣！太棒了！” 好吧…不再有趣了…她现在只是在得寸进尺！

"I said enough! Asuka, get off of him!" with a chuckle, she crawls off of me, "Okay you two, I think we need to talk!" 'the talk'. I've already had this!  
“我说够了！明日香，从他身上下来！”她笑着爬了下来，“好了，你们俩，我觉得我们需要谈谈！”‘那个谈话’。我已经经历过这个了！

"Misato! Lighten up! It was a joke!" Misato rolls her eyes and goes into the kitchen.  
“美里！放松点！那只是个玩笑！”美里翻了个白眼，走进了厨房。

"Not funny! Here, if you're going to pull that crap, take this," Misato reaches in her jacket pocket and pulls out a small paper square. She tosses it at Asuka and Asuka catches it. This isn't going to turn out well… I knew what it was, but apparently Asuka didn't. She read the back of it, then went beat red, "Yeah, now who's laughing!"  
“不好笑！听着，如果你要搞这种恶作剧，拿好这个，”美里从她的夹克口袋里掏出一个小纸片。她朝明日香扔去，明日香接住了。这不会有什么好结果的……我知道那是什么，但显然明日香不知道。她看了看背面，然后脸红得像熟透的番茄，“是啊，现在谁在笑！”

"Still me. Tell me, why did you have this?" she had a smirk on her face. Suddenly, the doorbell rang. Wanting to stay away from Asuka when she blows up, I get up to answer it. I open the door to Kaji standing there in casual clothes.  
"还是我。告诉我，你为什么会有这个？" 她脸上带着一丝得意的笑。突然，门铃响了。想在明日香爆发时远离她，我起身去开门。打开门，看到穿着便装的加持站在那里。

"Well if it isn't Shinji! So, is Misato here? Don't tell me she's cooking!" yep, it's Kaji. Misato came out of the kitchen with her annoyed face on, "Oh, there's the beautiful woman! May I come in?" Asuka still had the condom in her hands, and now she was stuck with it. In a quick action, she shoves it between the cousins.  
"哎呀，这不是真嗣嘛！那么，美里在吗？别告诉我她在做饭！" 没错，是加持。美里带着一脸不悦从厨房走出来，"哦，美丽的女士在这里！我可以进来吗？" 明日香手里还拿着那个避孕套，现在她被它困住了。她迅速行动，将它塞在表兄妹之间。

"You may. Make another crack about my cooking and you get to eat it, got it?" Kaji smiled and put his hands up.  
"你可以进来。再对我的厨艺说三道四，你就得吃下去，明白吗？" 加持笑了笑，举起双手。

"Okay, I'll shut up now." He walks inside and kisses Misato… deep…  
“好吧，我现在闭嘴。”他走进屋内，深深地吻了美里……

"Geez you two, get a room!" Misato glares at Asuka.  
“天哪，你们俩，找个房间吧！”美里瞪着明日香。

"Hey! You're just jealous that you haven't done that with Shinji!" did she just say… damnit…  
“嘿！你只是嫉妒你还没和真嗣那样做！”她刚才是说了……该死……

"Whoa-ho! Nobody told me about that! So the two teens are in love, huh?" great, no even Kaji knew! At least he could actually help with this.  
“哇哦！没人告诉我这个！所以这两个青少年相爱了，嗯？”太好了，连加持都知道！至少他还能在这事上帮上忙。

"Misato!" we both yell in unison. Are we still recovering from the effects of that damn DDR pad? Misato and Kaji laughed at us, and we simply turned red. Time to shoot back! "At least we're staying together!" damnit! We did it again! They just laughed all the harder.  
“美里！”我们异口同声地喊道。我们还在从那该死的跳舞垫的影响中恢复吗？美里和加持笑了起来，我们只是脸红了。是时候反击了！“至少我们在一起！”该死！我们又来了！他们笑得更厉害了。

"You two are perfect for each other! I have to admit Shinji, nice one. Never thought you had it in ya!" maybe Kaji wasn't that helpful… almost like an act of God, the door bell rang. As always, I get up and answer it.  
“你们俩真是天生一对！我得承认，真嗣，干得漂亮。从没想到你还有这一手！”也许加持并不那么有用……几乎像是天意，门铃响了。一如既往，我起身去开门。

"Is this Misato's apartment? I have a food delivery here."  
"这里是美里小姐的公寓吗？我这里有份外卖。"

"Yeah, thanks," I take the food from him and hand hum a few dollars as a tip. With a wave, he left, "Okay, foods here" I walk back over and set it down on the table.  
"嗯，谢谢。" 我从他手中接过食物，递给他几美元作为小费。他挥了挥手，离开了，"好了，食物到了" 我走回去，把它放在桌子上。

"It's about time! I'm starving!" Misato grabbed one of the boxes and flung it open, "Come on! Dig in!" she begins to devour her meal. We all just stare at her as she engulfs the food. Even Kaji had a disgusted look on his face!  
"终于来了！我快饿死了！" 美里抓起一个盒子，猛地打开，"快点！开动吧！" 她开始狼吞虎咽地吃起饭来。我们都只是盯着她，看着她大口吞食。就连加持脸上也露出了厌恶的表情！

"How does she do that?" Asuka whispered in my ear.  
“她是怎么做到的？”明日香在我耳边低语。

"No idea…" “不知道……”

---

Later… Much Later – 3:00 AM  
后来…很久以后 – 凌晨三点

"Come on Kashi… just swon more drinksh…" like always, Misato was drunk after take-out. She had her full weight on Kaji's shoulder, and I could tell that he was mortified.  
"来吧，卡西…再喝一杯…"像往常一样，美里在点外卖后不久就醉了。她整个人都靠在加持的肩膀上，我能看出他尴尬极了。

"Misato, I think you've had enough. Let's get you to bed, okay?" he picks her up and leaves the table, leaving me and Asuka alone.  
"美里，我觉得你喝得够多了。我们送你上床睡觉，好吗？"他抱起她离开了桌子，留下我和明日香单独在一起。

"You know, Misato can be a real pain in the ass sometimes. Can't we ever have a dinner with friends without her getting piss-eyed drunk?" that, my dear Asuka, is the question that would kill us all… huh?  
"你知道，美里有时候真是个大麻烦。我们能不能有一次和朋友共进晚餐而不让她喝得烂醉如泥？"亲爱的明日香，这个问题可是会让我们都丧命的…嗯？

"I… don't know…" my mind is wandering again.  
"我……不知道……" 我的思绪又飘远了。

"Were you thinking too deep again?" I nod slightly, "Careful, you might hurt yourself like last time," she wasn't kidding around…  
"你又在深思熟虑了吗？" 我微微点头，"小心点，上次那样可能会伤到自己，" 她可不是在开玩笑……

"Anyway, we should be getting to bed. I don't want to be tired all day tomorrow." I get up and stretch my arms above my head. She gets up right after me and puts an arm around my shoulder.  
"总之，我们该去睡觉了。我不想明天一整天都昏昏欲睡。" 我起身，双臂向上伸展。她紧随其后，一只手臂搭在我的肩上。

"You know what? I think you're growing on me! I think I'll keep ya!" was that a compliment? She had a smile on, so I think it was. '_¡Sueño con ella!_' huh? '_¡Consiga en su damnit de los pantalones!_' what the hell? It sounded like some Hispanic guy was yelling.  
“你知道吗？我觉得你越来越让我喜欢了！我想我会留着你！”这是在夸我吗？她笑得那么开心，我想是的。‘¡Sueño con ella!’嗯？‘¡Consiga en su damnit de los pantalones!’搞什么鬼？听起来像是某个西班牙人在大喊大叫。

Gendo's Office 碇源堂的办公室

"Fuyutsuki! Shinji has found out about Jose! I knew he couldn't keep his damn mouth shut! Go to plan B!" Fuyutsuki hit a large red button on Gendo's desk.  
“冬月！真嗣发现了关于何塞的事！我就知道他那张破嘴守不住秘密！执行 B 计划！”冬月在碇司令的桌子上按下了一个巨大的红色按钮。

Misato's Crib 美里的小窝

_¡Usted puede nunca destruirme!_ Did Misato give me a beer?  
“你永远无法摧毁我！”美里是给我递了瓶啤酒吗？

"Shinji? Are you okay?" I just don't know anymore…  
"真嗣？你还好吗？" 我真不知道了……

"Yeah… just tired… I'm going to bed," with her still holding on to me, we begin to walk out of the kitchen. When we get to the hallway, she lets go of me, "Sleep good Asuka, see you in the morning."  
"嗯……只是累了……我要去睡觉了，" 她仍然抱着我，我们开始走出厨房。当我们走到走廊时，她放开了我，"晚安，明日香，明早见。"

"Yeah, you too… night," she walked into her room and I did the same with mine. after changing into a night-shirt and pants, I fall back onto my bed. Was what Misato said true, or was she teasing me again? A part of me hoped that what she said was true, but then again, it'd be kinda embarrassing. With high hopes for tomorrow, I close my eyes and start to fall asleep. Right before I do, I hear a very faint voice. _¿Leche conseguida?_  
"嗯，你也是……晚安，" 她走进她的房间，我也走进了我的。换上睡衣和裤子后，我倒在了床上。美里说的是真的，还是她又在逗我？我心里有一部分希望她说的是真的，但另一方面，这也有点尴尬。怀着对明天的期待，我闭上眼睛开始入睡。就在我快要睡着时，我听到了一个非常微弱的声音。¿Leche conseguida?

Morning – No Time 早晨 – 无暇时光

"Hey Shinji! Whatcha' doin'?" I was in the living room, for some reason alone, and Asuka just came through the front door. She was in her normal school uniform and had a huge smile on.  
"嘿，真嗣！你在干嘛呢？" 我独自一人在客厅，不知为何，明日香从前门走了进来。她穿着平常的校服，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。

"Just watching TV, you want to join?" with a smile, she walks over and sits next to me.  
"只是看看电视，你要一起吗？" 她微笑着走过来，坐在我旁边。

"So, anything special happen to you today?" she had a cute voice right now for some reason. She grabbed my arm and put it around her shoulders.  
"那么，今天有什么特别的事发生在你身上吗？" 不知为何，她的声音此刻听起来格外甜美。她抓住我的手臂，搭在她的肩上。

"No, not really," she laid her head on the crook of my neck. She was acting odd! She was never like this with me! "How about you?" like Misato said, I try to keep my cool.  
"没有，真的没什么，" 她把头靠在我的颈窝处。她的行为很奇怪！她以前从没这样对我！ "你呢？" 就像美里说的，我尽量保持冷静。

"Nothing special…" she paused as she crawled over me like that time when she tricked Misato. Her smile was ear-to-ear.  
"没什么特别的……" 她停顿了一下，像上次骗美里那样爬过我。她的笑容满面。

"I… don't think Misato's here," she leaned down and whispered in my ear.  
"我…觉得美里不在这里，"她俯身在我耳边低语。

"I know… this is just for us…" she leans back, only inches from my face, "Now close your eyes…" okay, she had my attention now! Doing as I was told, I lost one of my senses. A few seconds later, I feel a warm breath on my cheek, then a soft push against my lips. Was… she kissing me?! Slowly, I open my eyes and see her head on mine… she was! I was actually kissing Asuka! She pulled back and looked at me with a smile, "I told you not to open your eyes…" with another smile, she leans back in. our lips meet once again, and she puts her hand behind my head. After a couple seconds, she opens her mouth. Was this seriously happening to me?! I wonder how far I could push this… I put my hands on her hips as I melted into the kiss. One last time, she pulls back, "Not bad… you're pretty good… one more thing though. I need a favor… I need you to wake up…"  
"我知道…这只是我们俩的…"她向后靠，离我的脸只有几英寸，"现在闭上眼睛…"好吧，她现在引起了我的注意！我照做了，失去了一种感官。几秒钟后，我感到脸颊上有温暖的呼吸，然后是嘴唇上柔软的触碰。她…在吻我吗？！我慢慢地睁开眼睛，看到她的头靠在我的头上…她确实在吻我！她退后一步，微笑着看着我，"我告诉过你不要睁开眼睛…"她又笑了笑，再次靠近。我们的嘴唇再次相遇，她把手放在我的后脑勺上。几秒钟后，她张开了嘴。这真的发生在我身上了吗？！我想知道我能把这推到什么程度…我把手放在她的臀部，沉浸在这个吻中。她最后一次退后，"不错…你挺厉害的…不过还有一件事。我需要你帮个忙…我需要你醒来…"

Shinji's Room – Morning – 9:00 AM  
真嗣的房间 – 早晨 – 上午 9:00

"Wake up! Are you dreaming of me again?" oh shit… not again… that's four times this month! I lean up, trying to hide my shame, "Damnit Shinji, will you please stop with that?" like I could help it!  
"醒醒！你又在梦见我了吗？" 哦，该死……又来了……这个月已经是第四次了！我坐起身，试图掩饰我的尴尬，"该死的真嗣，你能别这样了吗？" 好像我能控制似的！

"Sorry… can you just leave? Please? For the love of God?" with a smirk, she walks out of the room, "Damn I need a lock on that door…" I mumble to myself. I get up ad get dressing in a pair of jeans with a black t-shirt. I walk out of the room to see a smiling Asuka… here it comes…  
"对不起……你能离开吗？求你了？看在上帝的份上？" 她带着一丝嘲笑走出了房间，"该死，我得在门上装把锁……" 我喃喃自语。我起身穿上一条牛仔裤和一件黑色 T 恤。走出房间，看到微笑的明日香……该来的还是来了……

"Did you know that Kaji spent the night? I don't think they did it, but still!" what's new? Kaji always spent the night when she got wasted. I guess now that they were dating it was somehow different… but they've always had SOME kind of attraction to each other, so I really didn't see the difference. Hell, me and Asuka are dating, yet we still sleep one door away from each other!  
"你知道吗，加持昨晚留宿了？我觉得他们没做那事，但还是！" 有什么新鲜的？加持总是她喝醉后留宿。我想现在他们交往了，情况有所不同……但他们一直都有某种吸引力，所以我真的没看出有什么区别。见鬼，我和明日香在交往，但我们还是睡在相隔一扇门的房间里！

"Yeah, just leave it. So, do you want to go to the movies now, or grab something to eat?" I already made reservations for twelve… please choose the post!  
“嗯，就放那儿吧。那么，你是想现在去看电影，还是先吃点东西？我已经订了十二点的位子……请选择后续活动！”

"Let's eat first, I'm hungry. Just give me a few minutes to get changed," I thought she looked fine… apparently I was wrong, "You should get changed too," apparently I was wrong about my clothes too. With a sigh, I go back in to my room and get changed AGAIN. This time it tried to wear something a little better. I grabbed a button-up long-sleeved shirt and put it over what I was already wearing, leaving it unbuttoned. You know, just adding this simple black, white-striped shirt made me look all the better. Feeling fairly confident, I walk back out of the room – this time with a few thousand Yen in my pocket. That would have SUCKED if I forgot money!  
“我们先吃饭吧，我饿了。给我几分钟换衣服，”我以为她这样已经很好了……显然我错了，“你也该换一下衣服，”显然我对我的着装也判断失误了。叹了口气，我回到房间再次更衣。这次我试着穿得稍微好一点。我拿起一件长袖纽扣衬衫，套在原本的衣服上，没有扣上扣子。你知道的，仅仅是加上这件简单的黑白条纹衬衫，就让我看起来更加得体。感觉相当自信，我再次走出房间——这次口袋里装了几千日元。要是忘了带钱可就糟透了！

"Hey Asuka! You ready?" her door was still closed and I was outside of it.  
“嘿，明日香！准备好了吗？”她的门还关着，而我站在门外。

"Almost, just wait," I hear a rusting, obviously her getting dressed. Suddenly, I feel a tug at the back of my shirt. I turn and see Kaji with a big smile on… crap. I knew he was about to make an embarrassing comment.  
"快了，再等等，" 我听到一阵窸窣声，显然是她正在穿衣服。突然，我感觉衬衫后摆被拉了一下。我转过身，看到凯吉脸上挂着大大的笑容……糟糕。我知道他马上要说些让人尴尬的话了。

"So, your date with the wonderful Asuka is today, huh? You nervous?" well NOW I was!  
"所以，你和迷人的明日香今天的约会，对吧？紧张吗？" 哎呀，现在我真的紧张了！

"N-No… not really…" liar…  
"不……不怎么紧张……" 骗子……

"Good, just remember to keep your cool, okay? And also," here it comes… "take this," he hands me a small box of mints, "Since you're going to the movies AND lunch, you might just need these!" ah damnit…  
"好，记得保持冷静，好吗？还有，" 他递给我一盒小薄荷糖，"既然你要去看电影和吃午饭，这些可能会派上用场！" 啊，该死……

"Kaji!" he laughs his normal confident laugh, "You know Asuka wouldn't go that far on the first date," I tried to keep my voice down; I was right outside her door.  
"加持！" 他发出平时那种自信的笑声，"你知道明日香不会在第一次约会时就那么过分，" 我尽量压低声音；我就站在她门外。

"Okay, if you say so, just keep those on hand, okay? And… try not to pull anything at the movies… I did that with Sato'… look, if you like your organs where they are, keep your hands off of her until she shows a sign of wanting it, okay?" he had his hand on his stomach, apparently remembering his date as he walked back into Misato's Room.  
"好吧，既然你这么说，就随身带着，好吗？还有……看电影时别乱来……我和剑介那次……听着，如果你还想保持器官完好无损，在她表现出想要之前，别对她动手动脚，好吗？" 他手捂着肚子，显然是想起了那次约会，一边走回美里小姐的房间。

"So, ya ready to take me out?" I shove the box in my pocket as I whip around to see Asuka. I didn't even hear her get out of the room! I skimmed over her new out fit… wow. She was… actually beautiful. She wore a red short dress that cut off at her upper knee. It had a slit on the left side, showing her upper thigh. Her V-cut neck showed… enough cleavage… it was all held up by spaghetti straps… okay, so not TOO much to hold up, "You like? I got this six months ago on a shopping spree with Hikari. It's… a little tight…" a little?! You could see every detail of her body! It was damn near a plug suit!  
"那么，准备好带我出去了吗？" 我把盒子塞进口袋，猛地转身看到明日香。我甚至没听到她离开房间的声音！我快速扫了一眼她的新装扮……哇。她……真的很美。她穿着一件红色短裙，裙摆到大腿中部。左侧有一道开衩，露出她的大腿。V 字领口……露出了恰到好处的乳沟……这一切都由细肩带支撑着……好吧，其实也没太多需要支撑的，"你喜欢吗？这是六个月前和光一起购物时买的。它……有点紧……" 有点？！你几乎能看到她身体的每一个细节！这简直快赶上紧身衣了！

"I think it looks great," of course I did! Any guy would!  
"我觉得很好看，" 当然好看！任何男生都会这么觉得！

"Thanks…" I saw a slight blush on her face as she smiled. At this point, I really don't care that I just got done spending 4000 Yen just for the reservations. Seeing her like this – no, not just looking sexy, happy too – was far from worth it.  
"谢谢……" 我看到她脸上微微泛起红晕，微笑着。此时此刻，我真的不在乎刚刚花了 4000 日元只为预订座位。看到她这样——不，不仅仅是性感，还有快乐——这一切都无比值得。

"Let me just call a cab and we can get going," after a few minutes, the cab was 'on its way'. We both sit down on my bed and patiently wait for the cab… unfortunately Misato was up and sober. She comes walking into my room and goes wide eyed.  
"让我叫辆出租车，我们就可以出发了，"几分钟后，出租车已经在路上了。我们俩坐在我的床上，耐心等待出租车的到来……不幸的是，美里醒了，而且清醒得很。她走进我的房间，眼睛瞪得大大的。

"Asuka! Cover up! Damn!" Asuka grabs my pillow and covers up the opening to her dress, "Are you seriously going to go out like that?" Asuka was blushing so bad!  
"明日香！遮一下！该死！"明日香抓起我的枕头，遮住了她裙子上的开口，"你真的要这样出门吗？"明日香的脸红得厉害！

Gendo's Office 碇源堂的办公室

"Fuyutsuki…" Gendo had an annoyed look on his face.  
"副司令……"源堂脸上露出不悦的表情。

"Yes sir?" "是的，长官？"

"Remind me to write up Major Katsuragi for covering indecent exposure to a pilot," Gendo had cameras installed EVERYWHERE in the Katsuragi residence after the angels were all dead. Hey, a man needed some entertainment!  
"提醒我给葛城美里少校写份报告，关于她对飞行员的不雅暴露行为，" 在所有天使都死后，碇源堂在葛城家安装了摄像头。嘿，一个男人总需要些娱乐！

"Yes sir…" _fucking pedophile…_  
"是的，长官…" 该死的恋童癖…

Misato's Crib 美里的小窝

"Well excuse me if I grew! This used to be past my knees!" wait… if she grew that much… no wonder she said it was tight!  
"哎呀，如果我长高了，请原谅！这衣服以前可是过膝的！"等等…如果她长高了那么多…难怪她说衣服紧！

"I thought you two were just going out to the movies! Why are you wearing THAT?!" hey, she was the only one complaining.  
"我以为你们俩只是去看电影！为什么要穿成那样？！"嘿，只有她在抱怨。

"Just like you said Misato, 'Just because you have a puny B+ cup doesn't mean I have to'. Well, just because I'm still young and have enough to show off my body doesn't mean I shouldn't!" like Misato didn't have anything to show! A friggen double-D cup and Asuka says THAT?!  
"就像美里说的，'就算你只有 B 罩杯，也不代表我也要这样'。好吧，就算我还年轻，身材有料，也不代表我不该展示！"就像美里没什么可展示似的！她可是有 D 罩杯，明日香居然这么说？！

"Whatever… as long as you're wearing something underneath, it's okay. Just cross your legs when you sit down, okay?" Misato seemed pretty calm about this, "One thing though… does it have to be a thong?" Asuka owned a thong? I've never seen it… during laundry I mean!  
"“随便你……只要里面有穿东西就行。坐下时记得交叉双腿，好吗？”美里对此似乎相当淡定，“不过有一点……非得是丁字裤吗？”明日香有丁字裤？我从来没见过……我是说在洗衣服的时候！”

"MISATO!!!" Asuka threw the pillow at her "I'm not a friggen five year old!" Misato – at this point – was laughing her ass off.  
“美里！！！”明日香把枕头扔向她，“我又不是五岁小孩！”美里此时已经笑得前仰后合。

"So… thong, huh?" wrong thing to say on my part.  
“所以……丁字裤，啊？”我说错话了。

"Shut up! It's not like you'll ever get to see it!" she punches me in the arm… hard. Kaji comes into the room, almost laughing himself.  
"闭嘴！你又看不到！"她狠狠地捶了我的手臂。Kaji 走进房间，差点笑出声来。

"What's this I hear about Asuka's thong?" Asuka hurls her shoe at him, ending with a large hole in the wall. Misato and Kaji both walk off laughing, leaving Asuka to fume… and me to die.  
"我听说关于 Asuka 的内裤是怎么回事？"Asuka 把鞋子朝他扔去，结果墙上留下了一个大洞。Misato 和 Kaji 笑着走开了，留下 Asuka 生气……而我则奄奄一息。

"Um… sorry about that…" she got up and flattened out her dress.  
"呃……抱歉……"她站起来，整理了一下裙子。

"Forget it… now… seriously," yeah, like I was going to forget this! My girlfriend was wearing a thong!  
“算了吧…现在…说真的，”是啊，我怎么可能忘记这个！我女朋友穿的是丁字裤！

"Forget what?" “忘记什么？”

"Good boy…" just then we hear a car horn honking, "Sounds like our ride is here. You ready?" I get up and take hold of her hand.  
“好孩子…”就在这时，我们听到汽车喇叭声，“听起来我们的车到了。准备好了吗？”我站起来，握住她的手。

"Yeah," that was the first time I actually went for her hand, and it turned out better then I thought it would. She smiles a little and we both walk out to the cab. Inside was a dark black man with dread-locks. He looked Jamaican, mainly because of his shirt. 'Ziggy' was written across it with green yellow and red. I open the door for Asuka and she crawls in.  
“嗯，”那是我第一次真正去牵她的手，结果比我想象的要好。她微微一笑，我们一同走向出租车。车内坐着一位留着辫子的黑人，看起来像是牙买加人，主要是因为他的衬衫。上面用绿色、黄色和红色写着‘Ziggy’。我为明日香打开车门，她钻了进去。

"So, where ya be goin' me young couple?" oh yeah, he's Jamaican.  
“那么，你们这对小年轻要去哪儿呀？”哦，没错，他是牙买加人。

"Um… to the Hoaiti please," with a nod, he begins to drive.  
“呃……请去海地，”他点头后，便开始驾车。

"So, you two on ya first date? I still rememba me first date. She was a good fut and a half talla then me… what times!" he seemed like a pretty nice guy. I look oer at his drivers license mounted on the headboard. "Ichbal Nahied"… that… didn't sound Jamaican. The picture looked like Sadam too.  
"所以，你们俩这是第一次约会？我还记得我的第一次约会。她比我高出一个头还多……那些时光啊！" 他看起来是个挺不错的人。我瞥了一眼他挂在床头板上的驾照。"伊赫巴尔·纳希德"……这名字听起来可不像牙买加人。照片看起来还挺像萨达姆的。

"Um… if you don't mind my asking… what's up with the picture?" he lets out a small chuckle.  
"呃……如果不介意我问的话……那照片是怎么回事？" 他轻声笑了一下。

"Me go through some changes, mon. Don't you worry about it none!" slowly, I reach over and buckle Asuka's seatbelt, then mine, "So tell me, how'd ya two meet?" my heart was racing at this point.  
"我经历了些变化，伙计。别担心这个！" 我慢慢伸手过去，给明日香系上安全带，然后是我的，"那么告诉我，你们俩是怎么认识的？" 此时我的心跳加速。

"W-We met because o-of the Evas…" he let out a booming laugh.  
"我们相遇是因为 Eva……"他爆发出一阵响亮的笑声。

"No jokin' around mon, really how'd ya meet? School?" I didn't exactly feel safe in this guy's car.  
"别开玩笑了，伙计，你们到底是怎么认识的？学校吗？" 我坐在他的车里，并没有感到特别安全。

"We're pilots… I'm the Second child and he's the Third." She reaches up and grabs one of his locks, "Now, I recommend you tell us exactly who you are… that is unless you don't like your hair." Like that was going to work!  
"我们是驾驶员……我是第二适格者，他是第三适格者。" 她伸手抓住他的一缕头发，"现在，我建议你告诉我们你是谁……除非你不喜欢你的头发。" 就像那样能起作用似的！

"Wait! Hold up little girlie! Don't rip out me locks!" I've been wrong before, "Me be a alien, don't be a rat! I just tryin' to maka livin'!" with a sigh, she lets him go, "Thanks ya so much!"  
"等等！小姑娘，别扯我的头发！" 我以前也犯过错，"我是个外星人，不是老鼠！我只是想谋生！" 她叹了口气，放开了他，"非常感谢！"

"Whatever, just hurry up," the man took the fastest route to the restaurant, wich only took a few minutes. Just as we were getting out of the car, he spoke.  
"随便了，快点就好，" 那人选择了去餐馆的最快路线，只花了短短几分钟。我们刚下车，他就开口了。

"Why, thank you so very kindly for not beating me. Consider this ride free of charge, and may you both have a wonderful day. Don't let this relationship go, young love is such a fragile thing. Good day to you both," what the fuck?! We both just stare at him.  
"哎呀，非常感谢你们没有打我。这次车费就免了，祝你们俩有个美好的一天。别让这段关系结束，年轻的爱情是如此脆弱。两位，祝你们有个好日子，" 什么鬼？！我们俩都盯着他看。

"Um… thank… you?" "嗯…谢谢…你？"

"Anytime mon! Hopen' to see ya both soon! YEAH!" with that, he sped off.  
""随时欢迎，伙计！希望很快能再见到你们！耶！"" 说完，他疾驰而去。

"Uh…" we both just stare at the tire marks on the road, "Are… you ready?" I think we just found a universal rift…  
"呃…" 我们俩都盯着路上的轮胎痕迹，"你…准备好了吗？" 我想我们刚刚发现了一个宇宙裂缝…

"Uh… huh…" Slowly, I took a wide-eyed Asuka's hand and took her inside. This was a pretty nice place, nice and peaceful. Candle lit rooms, quiet conversation, and the sweet aroma of food roamed the air.  
"呃…嗯…" 我缓缓地牵起瞪大眼睛的明日香的手，带她走了进去。这里真是个不错的地方，宁静祥和。烛光摇曳的房间，低声细语的交谈，还有食物的香甜气息在空气中飘荡。

"How may I help you two?" a dressed up man was behind a small podium with a clipboard in front of him.  
"两位需要点什么帮助吗？" 一位穿着考究的男士站在一个小讲台后，面前放着一块写字板。

"Yeah, we have a reservation for two under Shinji Ikari," with a smile he grabs two menus.  
"是的，我们预订了两个人的位置，名字是碇真嗣。" 他微笑着递给我们两份菜单。

"Why Mr. Ikari! We've been waiting for you!" not this crap again… "I hope a window seat will be to your liking. If any of the staff is not to your liking, please feel free to ask for me. My name is Tiato, and I'm the manager. Please make yourself at home!" he pulled out Asuka's chair as she sat down. After giving us our menus, he walked off with a smile.  
“哎呀，碇先生！我们可等您好久了！”又来这套……“希望靠窗的座位您会喜欢。如果有哪位员工不合您意，请随时找我。我叫蒂亚托，是这里的经理。请随意，就像在自己家一样！”他帮明日香拉出椅子，待她坐下后，递给我们菜单，微笑着离开了。

"Okay, what the hell was all that about?" Asuka was normally the one to like attention!  
“好吧，刚才那一套到底是怎么回事？”明日香通常可是喜欢引人注目的！

"You're the Second child, I'm the Third, our faces were all over the news after the third impact, what do you think? They're trying to suck up!" she got a small laugh out of this. Why is it that they were always so nice about this?  
“你是二号适格者，我是三号，第三次冲击后我们的脸可是在新闻上满天飞，你觉得呢？他们这是在拍马屁！”她这番话逗得我轻笑出声。为什么他们对此总是如此殷勤呢？

"Wonder if we could get a free meal out of this…" Asuka had a smirk on her face.  
"不知道能不能从这事儿上蹭顿免费的饭…" 明日香脸上露出一丝得意的笑。

"We could try… got your ID on you?" with a smile, she reached up and pulled it out of the top of her dress, "Uh… wow…" what else did she have in there?! Wouldn't mind finding out myself…  
"我们可以试试…你带身份证了吗？" 她笑着伸手从连衣裙领口处抽出证件，"呃…哇…" 她那儿还藏了些什么？！真想自己亲自探个究竟…

"Yeah, stare all you want, you ain't gettin' any!" damnit!  
"对，尽管看吧，你可别想得到什么！" 该死！

"I know…" man, did I ever. She set the card on the side of the table, making it very easily seen. Jus then a man in a tux walks up to us.  
"我知道……" 天哪，我真是太清楚了。她把卡片放在桌边，让人一眼就能看到。就在这时，一个穿着燕尾服的男人向我们走来。

"Hello, my name is Sao…" he turns his head and looks at the manager staring at him, "What can I start you off with today? The house recommends the bottled wi… never mind…" this guy was damn near sweating!  
"您好，我叫 Sao……" 他转过头，看到经理正盯着他，"今天您想从什么开始呢？我们推荐瓶装威……算了……" 这家伙几乎要冒汗了！

"Can we just order our food?" Asuka had a smirk on for some reason as she said that.  
"我们能直接点餐吗？" 不知为何，明日香说这话时带着一丝得意的笑。

"Of course miss, what can I get you today?"  
"当然可以，小姐，今天想点些什么？"

"Let me get the steak, well done please. And can I have a side of salad?" ouch… my wallet…  
"请给我来份牛排，全熟的。另外能加一份沙拉吗？" 哎呀…我的钱包…

"Of course, and for the young man?" he jotted down Asuka's order on a pad of paper.  
"当然，那这位年轻人呢？" 他在便签本上记下了明日香的点单。

"Um… just give me the broccoli soup…" I saw the guy chuckle under his breath. Man… I hope I have enough money left over to pay for the movie! With a smile, he walks off.  
“呃……给我来份西兰花汤就行……” 我看到那家伙轻声笑了笑。天啊……希望我剩下的钱够付电影票！他微笑着走开了。

"Listen… sorry about the whole Misato thing…" Misato thing?  
“听着……关于整个美里的事情……抱歉……” 美里的事情？

"Huh? Misato thing?" she blushed a little, then I knew what she was talking about.  
“嗯？美里的事情？” 她微微脸红，我这才明白她在说什么。

"When she saw me… I really wish she didn't do that!" the while thong thing… it's not like I minded! "I only bought this thing because Hikari told me to…" Hikari? Brown haired Hikari?  
"“当她看到我……我真希望她没那么做！”那整件事……我倒不是介意！“我买这东西只是因为光子让我买的……”光子？棕色头发的光子？”

"How would she know about it?!" Asuka chuckled. Seriously, Hikari wearing THAT? I just can't ever imagine that happening…  
"“她怎么会知道这件事？！”明日香轻笑。说真的，光子穿那个？我简直无法想象那会发生……”

"Look, can we just drop it? I'm just saying I'm sorry," damnit…  
"“听着，我们能别提了吗？我只是说声对不起，”该死……”

"Okay, don't worry about it…" awkward silence… extremely awkward… that is until the waiter came up to the table.  
"“好吧，别担心……”尴尬的沉默……极其尴尬……直到服务员走到桌前。”

"I'm so sorry, I forgot to get your drinks. May I get you something to drink?" yeah, can I get a full glass of penicillin?  
"“非常抱歉，我忘了给你们拿饮料。可以为您点些什么喝的吗？”“嗯，能给我来一整杯青霉素吗？””

"Can I just get a glass of water?" I'm trying to keep it cheap, mainly because Asuka was wiping me out.  
"“我只要一杯水就行了吗？”我正试图节省开支，主要是因为明日香把我花得差不多了。”

"Same here," thank you God! Some of the drinks on there were a good 3000 Yen!  
"我也是，" 感谢上帝！那上面的有些饮料要价高达 3000 日元！

"Of course," with that, he walked off. Suddenly, I feel warmth wrap around my hand on the table. I look down to see Asuka's hand resting on top of mine, and he smiling slightly.  
"当然，" 说完，他便走开了。突然，我感觉一股温暖环绕在桌上的手上。低头一看，是明日香的手放在我的手上，他微微一笑。

"You know, we both need to lighten up. We're here to have fun, not this awkward as hell conversation!"  
"你知道吗，我们俩都需要放松一下。我们来这里是找乐子的，不是进行这种尴尬至极的对话的！"

"I know… it's just…" might as well flatter her. I have to opportunity, so I'm taking it, "I get nervous around such a beautiful woman," and the award for the biggest piece of crap line… Shinji Ikari!  
"我知道…只是…"不如夸夸她。我得抓住这个机会，"在这样美丽的女士面前，我总是会紧张，"这可是最烂的搭讪台词了…真嗣！

"Did I not just say to lighten up? Look, just act normal, just think of this as any other day, okay?" her smile got a little more seductive, "Of course… this day has meaning behind it…" she laced her fingers in with mine.  
"我不是刚说了要放松吗？瞧，就表现得自然点，就当今天是平常的一天，好吗？"她的笑容多了几分诱惑，"当然…今天背后有特别的意义…"她将手指与我的交缠在一起。

"Okay… any other day… can it be the day that you ditched you date?" I don't care if I couldn't breath, I liked it!  
"好吧…当作平常的一天…可以是那天你甩掉约会对象的日子吗？"我不在乎是否无法呼吸，我喜欢这样！

"Um… maybe…" how many different smiles did this girl have?! I don't even know what this one is. Out of nowhere, we all hear a loud yelling coming from the kitchen. A guy comes storming out – actually running out and stands in the middle of the room.  
"嗯…或许…" 这女孩到底有多少种笑容啊？！我甚至不知道这是哪一种。突然间，我们听到厨房传来一阵响亮的叫喊声。一个家伙气势汹汹地冲了出来——实际上是跑出来的，站在房间中央。

"Okay, we're going to need all of you out of the restaurant now, we're having some electrical problems, and it wouldn't be safe if-" he was cut off by all the lights going red, leaving the very eerie, "Oh shit…" in an instant, thick metal sheets slam over all of the windows and one over the door. The guy turns around and yells into the kitchen, "Oh yeah, that angel defense system works real great! Why the hell did you leave it in?!" a mumbling went on between everyone in the room.  
"好了，我们需要你们所有人现在离开餐厅，我们遇到了一些电气问题，如果…" 他的话被所有灯光变红打断了，留下了一句诡异的 "哦，该死…" 瞬间，厚重的金属板猛地覆盖了所有的窗户和一扇门。那家伙转过身对着厨房大喊："哦，没错，那个天使防御系统真是棒极了！你们他妈的为什么要开着它？！" 房间里众人开始窃窃私语。

"Can't you just turn it off?" I heard one woman yell.  
"你不能直接关掉它吗？" 我听到一个女人喊道。

"No, I'm sorry, but this stays in effect for eight hours, there's no way to turn it off… all I can say is try and stay calm, we're in this for the long haul. Food will not be served due to the electricity being shit off, and all of your seats will be refunded. Sorry about this," as people began to yell, he walked back into the kitchen.  
"不，很抱歉，但这将持续八小时，无法提前关闭……我只能说尽量保持冷静，我们得做好长期准备。由于电力中断，将不提供食物，所有座位费用将退还。对此深感抱歉，"当人们开始喧哗时，他走回了厨房。

"You're… fucking… kidding me…" Asuka sat there, staring at the kitchen door wide eyed, "Eight hours?! We'll be here until six?!" damnit… well, at least we get to watch the movie at night, I'd rather have that anyway.  
"你……在……开玩笑吧……"明日香坐在那里，睁大眼睛盯着厨房门，"八小时？！我们要待到六点吗？！"该死……好吧，至少我们可以在晚上看电影，我宁愿那样。

"Well… looks like lunch is ruined…" you know, I can say the stupidest things sometimes. Trying to recover from my slip-up, I move my chair next to hers, still holding her hand, "We might as well get used to it, I doubt he was lying."  
"嗯……看来午餐泡汤了……"你知道，有时候我真会说些蠢话。为了弥补失言，我把椅子挪到她旁边，依然握着她的手，"我们最好习惯一下，我怀疑他没撒谎。"

"Damn this sucks…" she plops her head on my shoulder, "I was looking forward to this too…" almost out of instinct, I wrap an arm around her shoulders. Come to think of it, I'm way more comfortable around her now. Sure, we were dating, but I still wouldn't put it past her to knock me out!  
"该死，这真糟糕……" 她把头靠在我的肩上，"我本来还很期待这个的……" 几乎是出于本能，我用手臂环住了她的肩膀。仔细想想，我现在和她在一起感觉自在多了。当然，我们在交往，但我还是觉得她随时可能把我打晕！

"Oh my God! What are we going to do?!" some woman was balling her eyes out in the table next to us. Asuka turns around and looks at her with a blank stare.  
"哦，我的天哪！我们该怎么办？！" 旁边桌的一个女人泪流满面。明日香转过身，面无表情地看着她。

"All you can do is panic… we're all going to die… he was just sugar coating it, there's one more angel, and it's going to kill us all," the woman instantly fainted. Asuka turned back around with a smirk.  
"你只会恐慌……我们都要死了……他只是在粉饰太平，还有一只天使，它会杀了我们所有人，" 那女人立刻晕了过去。明日香转回身，嘴角露出一丝冷笑。

"You know, that was kinda mean," not that I was complaining about her shutting the hell up!  
"你知道的，那有点刻薄，" 不过我可没抱怨她终于闭嘴了！

"What? She was annoying, so I fixed it!"  
"什么？她太烦人了，所以我解决了问题！"

"Thank you miss. I'm sorry about my wife, she can get… hysterical at times." Aside from a soft mumbling, that room was quiet. It actually sounded like before the lights went red, not much has changed. People carried on with their lives just as nothing happened. I like the fact that humans are able to just ignore problems like they are nothing, in my opinion, that is a sign of strength. For some reason, thinking this way actually calms me.  
"谢谢您，女士。我为我的妻子道歉，她有时会……情绪激动。" 除了轻微的咕哝声，那个房间安静了下来。实际上，听起来就像红灯亮起之前一样，似乎什么都没变。人们继续他们的生活，仿佛什么都没发生。我喜欢人类能够无视问题，在我看来，这是一种力量的体现。不知为何，这样想确实让我感到平静。

"Don't worry about it!" she goes back to lying on my shoulder, "Hey Shinji," she whispers so only I could hear it, "You wanna have some fun?" might as well, nothing else was going on.  
"别担心！" 她又靠回我的肩膀，"嘿，真嗣，" 她低声耳语，只有我能听见，"想找点乐子吗？" 反正也没别的事可做。

"Um… sure… what do you have in mind?" she smiles and grabs my wrist. She gets up and guides me over to a small corner, hidden by a booth. We were completely out of sight by anyone near-by… huh… Asuka asked if I wanted to have fun, she brought me to a secluded corner, and she had a small smile on… huh… okay! She had my attention! "Um… what are we doing here?" ugh… fucking dumbass… THINK BEFORE YOU TALK!  
"嗯…当然…你有什么主意？" 她微笑着抓住我的手腕。她起身，带我走到一个小角落，被一个隔间遮挡住。我们完全避开了附近任何人的视线…嗯…明日香问我是否想找乐子，她带我来到一个隐蔽的角落，脸上带着一丝微笑…嗯…好吧！她引起了我的注意！"嗯…我们在这里做什么？" 呃…真是个蠢货…说话前先动动脑子！

"You said that you wanted to have fun, right?" I nod, trying not to smile, "Okay, well when we walk back out there, we're going to take one of the open booths. Since nobody can see us, I say we freak them out! After a few minutes, we can-" she was cut off by a man standing overhead.  
"你说过你想找乐子，对吧？" 我点头，尽量不笑出来，"好的，我们出去后，就坐一个空隔间。既然没人能看到我们，我提议我们吓吓他们！几分钟后，我们可以——" 她的话被一个站在上方的人打断了。

"Excuse me, but can you two return to your seats? We need to keep all people within sight," we get up and walk off, Asuka glaring at him the whole way. when we get back to the main room, Asuka casually sits at a booth, so I sit next to her, still wanting to do whatever she had in mind. She was right, no one could see us, not a person alive was able to see past the two feet of wood and cousin!  
“劳驾，两位能回到座位上吗？我们需要确保所有人都在视线范围内。”我们起身离开，阿斯卡一路上瞪着他。回到主厅后，阿斯卡随意地坐在一个卡座里，我也挨着她坐下，依旧想跟着她的计划行事。她是对的，没人能看到我们，没有任何人能透过这两英尺的木板和表亲看到我们！

"Okay, before I was so rudely interrupted, I was going say something… but I think this'll be better," she puts her arms around my neck, "I was going to wait until after the movies… but forget it…" she begins to lean in closer to my face. Please don't let this be another dream! When she got within centimeters of my lips, she spoke, "I'm not teasing this time…" suddenly, our lips meet, but only slightly. We weren't quite kissing, but our lips were touching. With a sudden burst of courage… or was it raging hormones… I lean in to her and the kiss finally starts. Her lips were so soft, it was like silk. This was my first kiss, and it was with the most beautiful girl in Japan… then I decide to become less poetic. I was kissing her! After all this time, I was finally kissing Asuka Langley Souryu! Man this was awesome! When – after about thirty seconds – she pulls back, she looks into my eyes with a smile.  
"好吧，在我被如此粗鲁地打断之前，我正想说点什么……但我想这会更好，"她张开双臂环住我的脖子，"我本想等到电影结束后……但算了……"她开始向我靠近。请不要让这又是一场梦！当她离我的唇只有几厘米时，她说道，"这次我不是在逗你……"突然，我们的唇轻轻相触，但并未完全吻上。我们的唇只是轻轻碰触。在一股突如其来的勇气……或是荷尔蒙的驱使下……我向她靠近，终于，吻开始了。她的唇柔软如丝，这是我第一次接吻，对象是日本最美丽的女孩……然后我决定不再那么诗意。我在吻她！经过这么长时间，我终于在吻明日香·兰格雷！太棒了！大约三十秒后，她后退，微笑着凝视我的眼睛。

"Glad you didn't wait…" was all I could mutter.  
"很高兴你没等……"我只能喃喃自语。

"Me too… you're not to bad Third…" she removes her arms from my neck and once again rests her head on my shoulder, "I wouldn't mind doing that again…" I couldn't help but smile.  
"我也是……你表现得不错，第三……"她从我的脖子上移开双臂，再次将头靠在我的肩上，"我不介意再来一次……"我忍不住笑了。

Six Hours Later 六小时后

Asuka was asleep on my shoulder, and the rest of the restaurant was asleep too. I was probably the only one still awake, not that I could even get to sleep that is. My mind was still racing from what happened earlier today. That was one of the few moments I have that will be ours, and nobody else's. I doubt she'll tell anyone, and I know I won't. It's not even about me being embarrassed about it, it was more of a privacy issue. I have little secrets these days, so I hold on to what I can.  
明日香靠在我的肩膀上睡着了，餐厅里的其他人也都进入了梦乡。我大概是唯一还醒着的人，倒不是说我能睡得着。今天发生的事情仍让我思绪万千。那是我们少数几个专属的时刻之一，无人能分享。我怀疑她不会告诉任何人，我也绝不会说。这无关我是否为此感到尴尬，更多的是出于隐私的考虑。如今我已没有多少秘密，所以我紧紧抓住我能保留的。

"Mmmmm…" Asuka stirs in her sleep, ending with her head falling onto my lap. She calmed back down and nuzzled into my lap. You know, I had to admit, she was cute when she slept. She seemed so peaceful, so calm. With Asuka, this was a rare moment. Thoughts of our past couldn't help but flash through my mind. Probably the most vivid memory was when we were asleep in the same room, and I came so close to kissing her. What was she muttering in her sleep? Why was she asking for her mother? From what I've heard, she hated her mother. Come to think of it, I don't know anything about her past. All I know is that she's from Germany, that's it.  
“嗯……”明日香在睡梦中动了动，最后头落在了我的腿上。她又平静下来，依偎在我的腿上。不得不说，她睡着的时候真的很可爱。她看起来那么平和，那么宁静。对明日香来说，这样的时刻实属难得。关于我们过去的思绪不由自主地闪过我的脑海。最生动的记忆莫过于我们曾同处一室入睡，我差点就吻了她。她在睡梦中喃喃自语些什么？为什么她在呼唤母亲？据我所知，她恨她的母亲。仔细想想，我对她的过去一无所知。我只知道她来自德国，仅此而已。

I put my hand on her head, simply from habit now that we were okay with… well… contact. Before this, I wouldn't be able to touch her if my life depended on it, so now I do it when I can. Damn… could I sound more like a pervert? But seriously, I did feel that way. Before I could ponder this any further, I hear a humming outside the metal window, then a shredding on the window. Asuka slept through this surprisingly, she didn't even move. Soon, a large circle started to appear on the metal, and then the circle popped out, showing the cab driver holding a huge saw.  
我把手放在她的头上，这纯粹是习惯使然，因为我们现在已经不介意……嗯……接触了。在此之前，如果我的生命取决于此，我也无法触碰她，所以现在我尽可能这样做。该死……我听起来能更像一个变态吗？但说真的，我确实有那种感觉。在我进一步思考之前，我听到金属窗外传来一阵嗡嗡声，接着是窗户被撕裂的声音。令人惊讶的是，明日香竟然睡得这么沉，她甚至没有动一下。很快，金属上开始出现一个大圆圈，然后圆圈弹了出来，露出了拿着一把巨大锯子的出租车司机。

"Hey mon! Me heard about this place under lock, so me came to save ya! Oh! Lookin' like you were doin just fine!" he looks down at Asuka sleeping.  
“嘿，伙计！我听说这个地方被锁住了，所以我来救你们了！哦！看起来你们过得还不错！”他低头看着正在睡觉的明日香。

"Why… did you come back?" was all I could mutter.  
“为什么……你会回来？”我只能喃喃自语。

"Because I like ya two! The little girlie there is one catch mon!" finally, Asuka slowly raises her head. When she figured out where she was laying her face turned beat red and she shot upright.  
"因为我喜欢你们俩！那边的小姑娘可是个厉害角色！"终于，明日香缓缓抬起头。当她意识到自己脸贴在哪里时，脸颊瞬间变得通红，猛地坐直了身子。

"Sorry… oh, what's he doing here?" her face lit up when she saw the man.  
"对不起……哦，他在这里做什么？"看到那个男人时，她的脸上露出了光彩。

"I think he's here to save us, right?"  
"我想他是来救我们的，对吧？"

"No mon, I cut a hole in metal fo fun. Yeah me here to save ya! Now come on, tell the rest of em to get up," still dumbfounded at what's happening, I don't move, "Okay mon, me can do it,' with a rip of a cord, the saw starts up again. I hear a few people fall to the floor, and a few simply gasp, "Okay, if you wanna out of here, come on!" within two seconds people were lined up outside of the booth. Me and Asuka crawl out of the window… well… SHE crawled out of the window while I blocked the view by her request. When everybody was outside, the crowd slowly diminished into just us three.  
"不，伙计，我在金属上割个洞只是为了好玩。对，我在这儿是来救你的！快点，告诉其他人也起来，" 我仍对发生的事情感到困惑，没有动弹，"好吧，伙计，我来搞定，" 随着一声拉线，锯子再次启动。我听到几个人倒地的声音，还有几个人只是倒吸了一口气，"好了，如果你们想离开这里，快点！" 不到两秒钟，人们已经排在了展位外。我和明日香从窗户爬出来……嗯……是她爬出来的，而我则按她的要求挡住了视线。当所有人都出来后，人群慢慢减少，只剩下我们三个。

"Thanks for that, we owe you one," Asuka actually put out her hand and shook his when she said that.  
"谢谢你，我们欠你一个人情，" 明日香竟然伸出手，在他这么说的时候和他握了握手。

"Don't ya worry none girlie! If ya two need anything else, just ask! Me name is Bob, just so ya know," well, I could use one more thing.  
"别担心，姑娘！如果你们还需要什么，尽管问！我叫鲍勃，记住了，" 嗯，我确实还需要一样东西。

"Do you have your cab with you? We kinda need to get to the movie theater." With a smile, he points to a certain yellow car in the street.  
"你带着出租车吗？我们得赶紧去电影院。" 他笑着指向街上的一辆黄色汽车。

"Sure mon! Just hop in and hold on!" with shaking hands, we walk back to the cab. He said hold on… I don't like that. When we get into the back seat, he revs the engine to life and speeds off. "So, ya two really pilots? So is you Rei and you Shinji?" uh oh…  
"当然啦，伙计！快上车，抓紧了！" 我们颤抖着手走回出租车。他说抓紧……我不喜欢这样。一坐进后座，他就发动引擎疾驰而去。"那么，你们俩真的是飞行员吗？你是丽，你是真嗣吗？" 哦哦……

"Like hell I'm that blue haired whore! Don't you ever call me that again!" that wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  
"我才不是那个蓝毛婊子！别再那样叫我！" 这比我想象的要好一些。

"Oh, me bad, so you be Asuka?" finally!  
"哦，我错了，你就是明日香？终于见到你了！

"Yeah, and don't you forget it!"  
"没错，你可别忘了！

"So tell me, how new be this relationship?" the theater was coming into sight.  
"那么告诉我，这段关系有多新？" 剧院渐渐映入眼帘。

"Only a few days," I actually responded to that question, I actually just wanted to end the conversation.  
"只有几天，" 我居然回应了那个问题，我其实只是想结束对话。

"Oh really? Well, looks like our time be up, see ya two later!" the car screeched to a halt in front of the theater, "In case ya two ever need a ride, call 666-6666!" we get out of the car and look at him through the window.  
"哦，真的吗？好吧，看来我们的时间到了，再见两位！" 车子在剧院前急刹车停下，"如果你们俩以后需要搭车，打 666-6666！" 我们下车，透过车窗看着他。

"Thanks again for getting us out of there," why did I always have to be the one to be polite?  
"再次感谢你带我们离开那里，" 为什么我总是不得不表现得有礼貌？

"Why, simply forget about it. It was my pleasure to help my new friends. Remember, if you need anything, ever, just call that number… or… you can whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you?" what the hell?! We both just stand there staring at him wide eyed, "Uh… see ya two! Talk to ya later!" we still stood there staring, "OKAY! I'm out!" he speeds off into the night air. Okay, so not so much night as it was four PM…  
"哎呀，别放在心上。帮助新朋友是我的荣幸。记住，如果将来有任何需要，随时打那个电话……或者……你可以吹口哨。你知道怎么吹口哨，对吧？" 什么鬼？！我们俩都瞪大眼睛站在那里盯着他，"呃……再见两位！回头聊！" 我们还是站在那里发愣，"好吧！我走了！" 他迅速消失在夜色中。好吧，其实不算夜晚，那时才下午四点……

"Did you notice the…?" "你注意到那个……？"

"Uh huh…" "嗯哼……"

"And did he…?" "他真的……？"

"Uh huh…" "嗯嗯……"

"What is he?" "他是什么人？"

"No friggen idea…" with my last comment, we shake it off and walk to the ticket booth, hand in hand. When we get there, we see a VERY old woman looking at the computer in confusion, "Um… excuse me? Can we get two tickets to The Suffering?" she pops up her head and looks at me wide eyed.  
"完全没头绪……" 说完最后一句，我们甩甩手，牵着手走向售票处。到了那里，我们看到一位非常年迈的妇人正困惑地盯着电脑屏幕，"呃……打扰一下？我们能买两张《苦难》的票吗？" 她抬起头，睁大眼睛看着我。

"Oh! I'm sorry, of course," she pressed a button and two tickets popped out, "That'll be 1800 Yen please," in a quick exchange, I hand her the money and I take the tickets. I just wanted to be in seclusion again, I liked it like that. When we get to the theater room, we see that it was completely empty. The movie was just now starting, so it looks like we were the only ones in here.  
"哦！对不起，当然可以，" 她按下一个按钮，两张票弹了出来，"请付 1800 日元，" 我迅速递给她钱，接过票。我只是想再次独处，我喜欢那样。当我们进入放映厅时，发现里面空无一人。电影刚刚开始，看来我们是唯一在这里的观众。

"Man, this place really has gone downhill, huh?" after the Third Impact, the theater has had little visitors, few people even had the time. Japan was still getting on its feet economy wise, so people were working their asses off.  
"伙计，这个地方真的没落了，是吧？" 在第三次冲击之后，这家影院几乎没有访客，很少有人有时间。日本在经济上仍在努力恢复，所以人们都在拼命工作。

"Yeah well, at least we have the movies all to ourselves, right?" she had a flat voice, though it was new, I've heard it before… where?  
"是啊，至少我们可以独享这些电影，对吧？" 她的声音平淡，虽然这是新的，但我以前听过……在哪里？

"Yeah, why don't you pick out the seats? With a smile, she guides me over to the middle row, and the two middle seats.  
"对，你为什么不选座位呢？她微笑着引导我走到中间一排，两个中间的座位。

"This good?" "这样可以吗？"

"Yeah, sure," hell, as long as I got to sit next to her, I was fine! The opening credits were over, and now the screen showed a first person view of a man running. He sounded horrified as he stormed through dark prison halls. He looked down to show a handgun being gripped in his hands.  
“当然，没问题，”只要能坐在她旁边，我就心满意足了！片头字幕已经结束，屏幕上现在显示的是一个男人奔跑的第一人称视角。他惊恐万分地冲过黑暗的监狱走廊。他低头一看，手中紧握着一把手枪。

"I… need to get to the light…" he muttered. When he finally came to a dead end, he stared at the wall for a second, then turned around to show a horrible creature staring right back at him. It had the head of a manikin that was held up on a neck-brace. It's body was all bandages aside from it's limbs, that all cut off at the joint – leaving a bloody stump – and very large knives replacing normal limbs. In an instant, it slashed across the man's head and the screen went black.  
“我……需要找到光明……”他喃喃自语。当他终于来到一个死胡同时，他盯着墙壁愣了一会儿，然后转过身，一个可怕的怪物正直勾勾地盯着他。这怪物有着人偶的头颅，被颈托支撑着。它的身体除了四肢全是绷带，四肢在关节处被截断——留下血淋淋的残肢——而巨大的刀片取代了正常的肢体。刹那间，它横扫过男人的头部，屏幕随即变黑。

"Nice…" I heard Asuka mutter. She would think that! The screen went black for a few seconds, the gold, thrashed letters came up that said 'The Suffering'. The screen came back on to show a man walking down a prison hall with a box full of his belongings. Casually, Asuka grabs onto my arm and lays her head on my shoulder… nice…  
“不错……”我听到明日香低声说。她会这么想的！屏幕黑了几秒钟，随后出现了金色、破碎的字幕，写着‘The Suffering’。屏幕再次亮起，显示一个男人拿着一箱个人物品走在监狱走廊上。明日香随意地抓住我的手臂，把头靠在我的肩膀上……真好……

Two Hours Later 两小时后

Two hours into the movie, and both good and bad has happened. On one hand, Asuka was holding onto my arm and lying on my shoulder, which was actually pretty nice. But behind us was some crazy woman is behind us screaming her head off at every appearance of a monster, which was about every minute. I could tell that it was starting to get on Asuka's nerves, and it was doing to same for me. On the screen Torque, who we found out was the main character, just shot off one of their head with a shotgun.  
电影开始两小时了，好坏参半。一方面，明日香抱着我的手臂，靠在我肩上，感觉相当不错。但背后有个疯狂的女人，每分钟怪物一出现就尖叫不止，这已经开始让明日香和我都感到烦躁。屏幕上，我们得知主角是托克，他刚刚用霰弹枪轰掉了一个怪物的脑袋。

"AAHHHH!!!" god that was getting on my nerves! Finally Asuka popped up and looked behind her.  
“啊啊啊！！！”天哪，这真让我抓狂！终于，明日香猛地抬头，回头看去。

"Look you crazy bitch, we're over here on our first date, and I'm sick of you acting like you're being killed. So, you can either shut the hell up or I'll mess up that pretty little face of yours. Got it?" holy crap… I knew she was getting annoyed, but damn.  
"听着，疯婆娘，我们这是第一次约会，我受够了你那副要死不活的样子。要么你给我闭嘴，要么我就毁了你那张漂亮的小脸蛋。明白了吗？" 天哪……我知道她已经很不爽了，但这也太夸张了。

"Um… sorry…" I heard the woman mutter. Asuka turned back around and went back to her old position.  
"呃……抱歉……" 我听到那女人低声说道。明日香转过身，回到了原来的位置。

"What the hell is her problem?" Asuka muttered as she went back to watching the movie. Torque once again shot at another monster, sending blood spraying everywhere. I heard the woman whimper behind us, but not scream. It was an improvement. The man once again shot at a monster, but it didn't die. Instead in just crawled around, dripping blood everywhere. The woman whimpered again. "I swear…" Asuka began to crack her knuckles with one hand, "She makes one more sound…"  
"她到底有什么毛病？" 明日香嘀咕着，继续看电影。托克再次向另一只怪物射击，鲜血四溅。我听到身后的女人低声啜泣，但没有尖叫。这是个进步。那男人再次向怪物射击，但它没死，只是爬来爬去，血流不止。女人又啜泣了一声。"我发誓……" 明日香开始用一只手活动手指关节，"她要是再发出一点声音……"

"AAAHHHH!!!" “啊啊啊！！！”

"That's it you bitch!" Asuka leaped over the row and to her, tackling her to the ground. I hear some struggling, but I don't look back. I'd rather not see Asuka beat up a person… okay, I'm lying. I look back to see Asuka standing over the woman… who is tied up and has duct tape over her mouth… how… where… what the hell just happened? "I think she'll be quiet now," Asuka climbed back over to her seat and took her place back on my shoulder.  
“就这样，你这个婊子！”明日香一跃过排，向她扑去，将她摔倒在地。我听到一些挣扎声，但我没有回头。我宁愿不看明日香打人……好吧，我在撒谎。我回头一看，明日香站在那女人上方……她被绑起来了，嘴上还贴着胶带……怎么……哪里……刚刚到底发生了什么？“我想她现在会安静了，”明日香爬回座位，重新坐回我的肩膀上。

"Did you have to tie her up?"  
“你非得把她绑起来吗？”

"Why not?" where did she even get the rope?  
“为什么不？”她到底是从哪儿弄来的绳子？

"Well… never mind… just make sure you untie her before we leave, okay?" she just chuckles as she watched the movie. She gazed at the gory movie while she held onto me. The movie was okay, sure, it was creepy, but after fighting all of those damn angels, I doubt I'll be scared of anything for the rest of my life.  
“好吧……算了……走之前记得把她解开，好吗？”她一边看电影一边轻笑。她一边紧抓着我，一边凝视着那部血腥的电影。电影还行，当然，挺吓人的，但经历了那么多该死的天使战斗，我怀疑这辈子还有什么能吓到我。

"Hey mon…" I heard a voice behind me, but apparently Asuka didn't, "Hey mon…" it was repeated slightly louder. I casually turn and look behind me. "It be me, how's it goin'?" BOB?! Thankfully Asuka didn't notice me turned around.  
“嘿，伙计……”我听到身后有声音，但显然明日香没听到，“嘿，伙计……”声音稍微大了一些。我随意地转过身去。“是我，过得怎么样？”鲍勃？！幸好明日香没注意到我转过身。

"What are you doing here?"  
"你在这里做什么？"

"Have ya made a move yet?" Asuka nuzzled a little closer to me, "Have ya?"  
"你行动了吗？" 明日香又向我靠了靠，"行动了吗？"

"No, now leave, I'll call you after the movie." How did he even get in here?  
"没有，现在离开，电影结束后我给你打电话。" 他是怎么进来的？"

"Kiss her mon, look at her, she's damn near asking for it!" he said a little louder.  
"亲她啊，老兄，看她那样子，简直是在求吻！" 他稍微提高了声音说道。

"No, now leave!" "不，现在走开！"

"Shinji? What are you doing?" crap! She heard me! I turn back around and look down at her with a smile, "Were you talking to the bitch back there? Leave her alone, she's just fine with where she is!" I fake a chuckle.  
"真嗣？你在干什么？" 糟糕！她听到了！我转过身来，带着微笑低头看着她，"你刚才是在跟那个婊子说话吗？别理她，她待在那儿挺好的！" 我假笑了一声。

"Okay, sorry," she laid her head back on my shoulder. I glance back to see that he was gone. Should I do what he said? I don't know what I'm doing here and people are giving me advice all over the place. What am I supposed to do here?!  
"好吧，抱歉，" 她将头靠回我的肩膀。我回头一看，他已经不见了。我该照他说的做吗？我在这里不知所措，到处都有人给我建议。我到底该怎么做？！

"Kiss her mon!" "吻她吧，伙计！"

"Asuka?" she looks back up at me. I put a hand on her shoulder and smile, "Thanks for coming with me…" slowly – very slowly – I begin to lean in.  
"明日香？" 她抬头看向我。我把手放在她肩上，微笑着说，"谢谢你陪我来……" 慢慢地——非常缓慢地——我开始向她靠近。

"Um… sure…" either subconsciously or on purpose, she begins to lean in too. Did she know what I was about to do? "I like it…" our faces get closer, and when she was almost out of sight, she closes her eyes. I could feel her breath on my cheek, and soon, our lips meet. No hesitation like last time, we both went for it knowing that we wanted it. She wraps an arm around my back and pulls me slightly closer. She always was the one to either initiate the kiss or at least deepen it… like I was complaining! Hell, as long as it was Asuka, I'm fine. Out of nowhere, she thrusted her hand to the back of my head and forced my mouth open. Just like I said, she's always the one to take control. We were like this for awhile… or not, I don't even know. I wasn't really paying any attention to time.  
“嗯……当然……”不知是潜意识还是故意的，她也开始向我倾斜。她知道我要做什么吗？“我喜欢这样……”我们的脸越来越近，当她几乎要消失在我的视线中时，她闭上了眼睛。我能感觉到她的呼吸拂过我的脸颊，很快，我们的唇触碰在一起。没有像上次那样的犹豫，我们都清楚自己想要什么。她用一只手臂环住我的背，轻轻将我拉近。她总是那个主动接吻或至少加深吻的人……我可没抱怨！见鬼，只要是明日香，我都没问题。突然间，她将手猛地伸到我的脑后，迫使我张开嘴。就像我说的，她总是掌控一切的那个人。我们就这样持续了一段时间……或者并没有，我甚至没注意时间。

"Way to go mon!" “干得好，伙计！”

Outside Of Movie Theater 电影院外

"What? I let her go!"  
"什么？我放她走了！"

"Yeah, but you threw her into the men's bathroom."  
"是啊，但你把她扔进了男厕所。"

"She called me short tempered!"  
"她居然说我脾气暴躁！"

"But did it have to be the MEN'S bathroom?" I failed to bring up the she was arrested for going in there.  
"但非得是男厕所吗？" 我没能提起她因进入那里而被逮捕的事。

"Whatever, she deserved it!" she grabbed onto my hand, and smiled, "So, how'd ya like our first date, huh?" what was I supposed to say? 'No, I hated being here with you, let go of me!' Of course I loved it!  
"管它呢，她活该！" 她抓住我的手，微笑着，"那么，你觉得我们的第一次约会怎么样，嗯？" 我该说什么呢？'不，我讨厌和你在这里，放开我！' 当然，我非常喜欢！

"It was great… especially the part near the end of the movie…" she blushed instantly.  
"非常棒……尤其是电影接近结尾的部分……" 她立刻脸红了。

"Yeah…" was all she muttered. With a smile, I take out my phone and call Bob. Within a few seconds, he was screeching to a halt in front of us. HOW THE HELL DOES HE KEEP DOING THAT?! I swear, he's friggen Houdini!  
“是啊……”她喃喃道。我笑着拿出手机，拨通了鲍勃的电话。几秒钟内，他就尖叫着在我们面前急刹车。他到底是怎么做到的？！我发誓，他简直就是个该死的胡迪尼！

"Hey me young lovers, hop on in! How'd ya date go?" like he didn't know! We climb into the back seat and immediately slap on out seat belts. We gripped each other's hand as he speed off.  
“嘿，我年轻的恋人们，快上车！约会怎么样啊？”好像他不知道似的！我们爬进后座，立刻系好安全带。他加速离开时，我们紧紧握住对方的手。

"Um… good…" “呃……挺好的……”

"That be good ta hear! So, did ya two share a kiss yet?" he was setting me up!  
"那真是太好了！那么，你们俩亲过了吗？"他这是在给我下套！

"That's none of your business!" Asuka instantly shot back. Bob laughs loudly and shakes his head.  
"这不关你的事！"明日香立刻回击道。鲍勃大声笑了起来，摇了摇头。

"Sorry bout' that girlie, I guess it ain't, is it?" the car then became silent aside from the honking horns outside. Just as always, he got us back to the apartment within a few minutes, "Okay, back at da Major's," wait… how'd he…  
"抱歉啊，小姑娘，看来这确实不关我的事，对吧？"车内随即陷入沉默，除了外面的喇叭声。一如既往，他几分钟就把我们送回了公寓，"好了，回到少校这儿了，"等等…他是怎么…

"Bob? How'd you know about Misato? How did you even know where we live?" he goes wide eyed and tries to explain himself.  
"鲍勃？你怎么知道美里的事？你怎么知道我们住哪儿的？" 他瞪大了眼睛，试图解释自己。

"I-I used to know da Major in collage, and I picked ya up here, so ya know!" he scratches the back of his head and laughs nervously. We get out of the car and wave as he speed off. I think we finally found a worse driver than Misato!  
"我-我在大学时认识美里少校，而且我是在这儿接你们的，所以你们知道！" 他挠了挠后脑勺，紧张地笑了笑。我们下了车，朝他挥手告别，他加速离开了。我想我们终于找到了一个比美里还糟糕的司机！

"Shinji? How does he know about Misato?" we begin to walk back into the apartment.  
"真嗣？他怎么知道美里的事？" 我们开始走回公寓。

"I have no idea…" we walk into the dark apartment, assuming that no one was home.  
"我完全不知道……" 我们走进昏暗的公寓，以为家里没人。

Gendo's Office 碇源堂的办公室

"How did it go sir?" a very dark man walks into Gendo's office with a smile on. He walks over to the mirror and wipes off the dark makeup.  
"情况如何，先生？" 一个肤色很深的人微笑着走进了源渡的办公室。他走到镜子前，擦掉了深色的化妆品。

"It went okay mon…" "还算顺利，伙计……"

### Chapter 6: Caught

Gendo's Office 碇源堂的办公室

"Sir? I'm sorry to question your authority, but why exactly did you just have two pilots kiss? This could affect both of their scores, I don't think that this is wise… and will you please take those cameras out of Major Katsuragi's apartment? I believe that it is an invasion of privacy." Fuyutsuki had a very annoyed look on his face as he stared at Gendo, who was staring at Asuka and Shinji just entering the apartment.  
"司令？很抱歉质疑您的权威，但您为何要让两名驾驶员接吻？这可能会影响他们的评分，我认为这并不明智……请您把那些摄像头从葛城美里少校的公寓里撤走，我觉得这是侵犯隐私。" 冬月脸上带着非常不悦的表情，盯着正在凝视着刚进入公寓的明日香和真嗣的碇。

"Naw mon, me don't think it'll affect their scores, they be strong. As for da privacy… me be bored…"  
"哎呀，老兄，我觉得这不会影响他们的评分，他们很强。至于隐私嘛……我只是无聊罢了……"

"I will give you 10000 Yen to stop that… please…"  
"我给你一万日元，请你停止这种行为……拜托了……"

"Naw mon, me good."

Misato's Crib

I was just opening the door into the apartment and letting Asuka in. with a smile, she accepts the open door. I follow after her.  
我刚打开公寓的门，让明日香进来。她微笑着接受了敞开的门。我跟着她进去。

"So… doesn't look like Misato is home… wanna order some food?" we were standing in to middle of the living room and enduring the awkward aftermath of a date, "Or I could make something…" damnit…  
“所以……看来美里不在家……想点些吃的吗？”我们站在客厅中央，忍受着约会后的尴尬余波，“或者我可以做点什么……”该死……

"No… it's alright," she slowly walks over to me, "I'm not too hungry right now…" she wraps her arms around my head and smiles wide, "But I do want something…" she leans in fairly quickly and embraces me in a tight kiss. Soon enough, it elevated to the level at the movie theater. Out of instinct, I put my hands on her hips and melt into her kiss. She's more intense right now, she's putting way more force into it. Not that I was complaining or anything, it was just kinda weird. Eventually, she makes me walk backwards into a wall, sending a loud thump through the room. now that she had me pinned up against a wall, she eased up a little for some reason. She has moved her arms from around my neck to my back, pulling me close as she could.  
“不……没关系，”她缓缓走向我，“我现在不太饿……”她张开双臂环抱住我的头，笑容灿烂，“但我确实想要点什么……”她迅速靠近，紧紧地吻住了我。很快，这吻就升级到了电影院里的那种程度。出于本能，我把手放在她的腰间，沉浸在这个吻中。她现在更加热烈，投入了更多的力量。我并不介意，只是感觉有点奇怪。最终，她让我退到墙边，房间里回荡着一声巨响。现在她把我按在墙上，不知为何稍微放松了一些。她把双手从我的脖子上移到我的背上，尽可能地把我拉近。

"Hold on Kaji, I'll be right back," I hear Misato's voice through out the apartment, but apparently Asuka didn't. She continued to kiss me deeply as I see Misato walk out of her room… EW! They were home… and apparently… ew… "ASUKA! SHINJI!" She jets back into her room in an instant. Asuka pulls back and blushes profusely.  
"等等，Kaji，我马上回来，" 我听到 Misato 的声音在整个公寓回荡，但显然 Asuka 没听到。她继续深情地吻我，而我看到 Misato 从她的房间走出来……呃！她们在家……而且显然……呃…… "ASUKA！SHINJI！" 她瞬间冲回自己的房间。Asuka 退开，满脸通红。

"I thought that she wasn't home!"  
"我以为她不在家！"

"At least you didn't see her…" my eyes were wide and my heart was pounding. I don't care how 'hot' all the guys at school think she is… that was just wrong. I see her as a mother! I don't want to see that! She comes storming out of the room with a robe on and grabs both my and Asuka's ear. She drags us over to the sofa and throws us down… once again, guess what happens, "Misato… a little help here…"  
"至少你没看到她……" 我的眼睛睁得大大的，心跳加速。我不在乎学校里那些男生觉得她有多'性感'……那真是太不对了。我把她看作母亲！我不想看到那一幕！她穿着浴袍气势汹汹地走出房间，抓住我和 Asuka 的耳朵。她把我们拖到沙发旁，扔了下来……又一次，猜猜发生了什么，"Misato……帮帮忙……"

"NO! What were you two about to do?! You thought we weren't home, is that it?" damn… she was pissed.  
“不！你们俩刚才想干什么？！以为我们不在家，是吗？”该死……她气炸了。

"Nothing! We weren't going to do anything!" Asuka shot back at her, "Now let us out!"  
“没什么！我们什么都没打算做！”明日香回敬道，“现在放我们出去！”

"Weren't doing anything my ass. You two were damn near about to swallow each other!" ew… "You can't even tell me that wasn't going to elevate! Geez Asuka, I gave you that thing as a joke, I never thought you'd actually use it!" I could feel that 'thing' digging into my back, "And on your first date too! Did you have to go that far? I can understand a little peck, but THAT?!" well, in our defense, we HAVE known each other for awhile now, "I mean look at you Shinji, I'm pretty damn sure you didn't leave with lipstick on!" yeah… I could feel the effects of the kiss on my lips… I won't deny that one.  
“什么都没做，鬼才信。你们俩差点就要把对方吞了！”呃……“你不能连这都不承认！天啊明日香，我给你那玩意儿只是开个玩笑，从没想过你真会用它！”我能感觉到那东西顶在我背上，“而且还是第一次约会！有必要做到这一步吗？我理解亲个小嘴，但那玩意儿？！”好吧，我们毕竟认识有一段时间了，“我是说，看看你，真嗣，我敢肯定你出门时嘴上没涂口红！”是啊……我能感觉到那个吻在我唇上的痕迹……这一点我不会否认。

"And what exactly were you doing prancing around naked, huh?" Asuka's turn to fight back…  
"你到底在干嘛，光着身子到处跑？" 轮到明日香反击了……

"Hey! I'M an adult! I'm able to take responsibility for my actions! Asuka, please tell me that you don't act like that on your previous dates!" Asuka HAS had her fair share of dates…  
"嘿！我是个成年人！我能对自己的行为负责！明日香，请告诉我你以前的约会不是这样的！" 明日香确实有过不少约会……

"Hell no! Shinji was my first kiss!" seriously? Sure as hell didn't seem like it! But really, what did I have to compare it to? She was my first too.  
"绝对没有！真嗣是我的初吻！" 真的吗？完全看不出来！但说真的，我又能拿什么来比较呢？她也是我的第一次。

"Misato, can you please let us out? My back is starting to hurt…" Misato rolls her eyes and pulls down the seat, "Thanks…"  
"美里，能请你让我们出去吗？我的背开始疼了……" 美里翻了个白眼，拉下座椅，"谢谢……"

"Oh, you won't be thanking me when I'm done with you! From now on, if you two want to see each other, you have to carry a condom," she points at me, "And you have to go on the pill." Holy crap! She was serious about this! Asuka instantly shot up and glared at her.  
"哦，等我处理完你们就不会感谢我了！从现在开始，如果你们俩想见面，必须随身携带避孕套，"她指着我，"而你得开始服用避孕药。"天哪！她是认真的！明日香立刻站起来，瞪着她。

"Like hell I will! Don't you trust us at all?" Misato took a deep breath and put her hands on Asuka's shoulders.  
"我才不会呢！你对我们一点信任都没有吗？"美里深吸一口气，双手放在明日香的肩膀上。

"Yes, of course I do. You I trust, it's your hormones I don't trust. I know that it's normal for you both to want this, but certain precautions have to be taken." Asuka backs away from Misato's hold.  
"是的，我当然知道。我信任你，但不信任你的荷尔蒙。我知道你们俩想要这是正常的，但必须采取某些预防措施。" 明日香从美里怀里挣脱出来。

"Just trust us… it's not like I'd even let Shinji poke around down there!" once again, ew… that analogy was just wrong… Misato lets out a sigh and smiles.  
"就相信我们吧……我又不会让真嗣在那儿乱摸！" 又一次，呃……这个比喻真是太糟糕了……美里叹了口气，微笑起来。

"Fine… but if I catch you two doing that again, you won't have a choice. Got it?" we both nod, "Now, who wants to say hello to Kaji?"  
"好吧……但如果我再发现你们俩那样做，你们就没得选择了。明白了吗？" 我们都点了点头，"现在，谁想跟加持打个招呼？"

"NO!" we both yell in unison. She laughs as she walks back into the room and shuts the door. A few minutes later wee se Kaji walking out with a wrinkled shirt and pants on.  
"不！" 我们异口同声地喊道。她笑着走回房间，关上了门。几分钟后，我们看到加持穿着皱巴巴的衬衫和裤子走了出来。

"Um… hey kids…" he had a bright blush on.  
"呃…嘿，孩子们…" 他的脸颊泛起了红晕。

"Pervert…" Asuka muttered as she walked into her room.  
"变态…" 明日香嘟囔着走进了自己的房间。

"So… um… how'd the date go" with a smile, I walk past him heading toward my room. With a slick move, I hand him the box of mints.  
“那么……呃……约会怎么样？”我带着微笑从他身边走过，朝我的房间走去。我灵巧地递给他一盒薄荷糖。

"Thanks," I close my door as I hear him chuckle.  
“谢谢，”我关上门，听到他轻声笑了起来。

Gendo's Office 碇源堂的办公室

Both men stare at the screen wide eyed. Each have a racing heart and shaking hands.  
两人都瞪大眼睛盯着屏幕。他们的心跳加速，手也在颤抖。

"Did they just…" Gendo nods, "And she just…" Gendo once again nods, "And Kaji…" he once again nods, "Wow…" a long pause followed as they stared at the empty living room of the Major's apartment, "I need a drink…"  
"他们刚刚是…" 源堂点头，"然后她只是…" 源堂再次点头，"还有加持…" 他又一次点头，"哇…" 长时间的停顿后，他们盯着少校公寓空荡荡的客厅，"我需要喝一杯…"

"Indeed…"

Misato's Crib

That was by far the best day of my life. It was actually the first time I've been truly happy in awhile. I pictured Asuka in the room across the hall from mine thinking the same thing, and I actually believed that to be true. I fall back onto my bed a instantly feel a large lump under the sheets. Then some grunting.  
那绝对是我一生中最美好的一天。实际上，这是我一段时间以来第一次真正感到快乐。我幻想着明日香在我对面的房间里想着同样的事情，我真的相信那是真的。我向后倒在床上，立刻感觉到床单下有一个大肿块。然后是一些咕哝声。

"Pen-Pen, mind telling me what you're doing in my bed?" I reach under the covers and pull him out by his beak, "Do you WANT dinner tonight?" he nodded, "Then I recommend that you stay out of my room and Asuka's room. Got it? Use her bad as a bathroom one more time and I will pluck out that stupid red Mohawk you got going." I let him go and he went running back into his cooler, "Damn bird…" I start to feel a wet spot on my bed seep through the sheets, "God damnit…" with a sigh, I get up and strip the bed. I walk back out of my room and toss them into the washer. I hit the start button and the washer springs to life, "I swear, he does that one more time…"  
"Pen-Pen，介意告诉我你在我的床上做什么吗？" 我伸手进被子，用他的喙把他拉出来，"你今晚想不想吃晚饭？" 他点头，"那我建议你不要进我的房间和明日香的房间。明白吗？再用她的床当厕所一次，我就会拔掉你那愚蠢的红莫霍克发型。" 我放开他，他跑回他的冷却器，"该死的鸟…" 我开始感觉到床上的湿点渗过床单，"该死…" 叹了口气，我起身拆下床单。我走出房间，把它们扔进洗衣机。我按下启动按钮，洗衣机开始运转，"我发誓，他要是再这么做一次…"

"AAAAHHHH!!!" I hear a scream coming from the bathroom… and water running… ah crap. I see Asuka jet out of the bathroom dripping wet… and naked… "What the hell was that?!" she loses her angry face and turns beat red. In an instant, she jets back into the bathroom, "Damnit Shinji, you did that on purpose!" I just stood there wondering 'maybe I should start…'  
“啊啊啊！！！”我听到浴室传来一声尖叫……还有水流声……啊糟糕。我看到明日香浑身湿透地冲出浴室……一丝不挂……“搞什么鬼？！”她愤怒的表情瞬间消失，转而满脸通红。一眨眼，她又冲回了浴室，“该死的真嗣，你绝对是故意的！”我站在那里，心里想着‘也许我该开始……’

"Um… s-sorry…" I could feel my face on fire. I swear, I didn't even hear the shower start! How was I supposed to know she was in there? She comes storming back out of the bathroom, this time in a robe.  
“呃……对、对不起……”我感觉自己的脸在发烧。我发誓，我根本没听到淋浴开始的声音！我怎么知道她在里面？她气势汹汹地再次走出浴室，这次裹着一件浴袍。

"I don't care how far I let you go today, you're NOT getting any free looks!" ah shit…  
“不管今天我让你走多远，你都别想占便宜！”啊，糟了……

"You're going to hit me really hard, aren't you?"  
"你真的要狠狠揍我一顿，对吧？"

"Oh yeah!"

Kitchen – 9:00 PM  
厨房 – 晚上 9 点

I rub my swollen arm in pain as I stir the food in the pot. Damn, I knew that she was pissed, but did she have to kick me? My arm is friggen purple! As I turn off the stove, I see Misato walk into the kitchen.  
我一边揉着红肿的手臂，一边搅拌着锅里的食物，疼得直咧嘴。该死，我知道她很生气，但她非得踢我吗？我的手臂都紫了！当我关掉炉子时，看到美里走进了厨房。

"So, you saw Asuka naked, huh?"  
"这么说，你看到明日香裸体了，嗯？"

"Yeah…"

"She kicked you, huh?"  
"她踢了你，对吧？"

"Yeah…"

"Does it hurt?"

"Yeah…"

"Did ya like seeing her?"  
"你喜欢看她吗？"

"Yeah… wait… HEY!" Misato laughs into the air as she walked up next to me.  
“是啊……等等……嘿！” 美里笑着向我走来，一边走一边对着空气喊道。

"I'm just messin with ya!" she wraps an arm around my shoulder, "Okay, enough joking," she got a serious look on her face, "I may not be making Asuka go on the pill, but I am making you carry around one of these." She slipped a condom into my hand, "Don't take this as a trust factor. I just want you to be safe in case things do go that far. Look, I'm not going to lie to you, I made some bad choices in my life. I was one of the lucky ones that didn't get pregnant, but I have plenty of friends that did. Please, just promise me that you'll keep this on you. Don't be afraid to ask for another one if you need it, I won't ask any questions, I won't lecture you, nothing. I'll just hand it to you and we'll be on our way. Okay?" she had almost a pleading look on her face. How could I say no? I knew that she was just trying to help.  
“我只是在逗你玩呢！” 她用一只胳膊搂住我的肩膀，“好了，玩笑开够了，”她脸上露出了严肃的表情，“我可能不会让明日香吃避孕药，但我确实要你随身携带这个。”她悄悄地把一个避孕套塞到我手里，“别把这当成信任的标志。我只是希望你在万一事情发展到那一步时能安全。听着，我不会对你撒谎，我这辈子做了一些糟糕的选择。我很幸运没有怀孕，但我有很多朋友怀过孕。请答应我，你会随身带着这个。如果需要的话，不要害怕再要一个，我不会问任何问题，不会教训你，什么都不会。我只会把它递给你，然后我们继续前进。好吗？”她脸上几乎带着恳求的表情。我怎么能拒绝呢？我知道她只是想帮忙。

"Sure Misato…" she smiles and begins to walk off, "thanks…" she stopped in her tracks for a second, then was on her way again. With a sigh, I relax and let my body fall back onto what I thought was a cool stove. I would always lean here if I'm waiting for the microwave to finish… but I was cooking… crap. I let out a scream and a few curses, and within a few seconds, Misato came rushing back into the kitchen.  
“当然，美里……”她微笑着开始走开，“谢谢……”她停顿了一下，然后继续前行。我叹了口气，放松下来，让身体向后倒在我以为是凉爽的炉子上。如果我在等微波炉结束时，总是会靠在这里……但我正在做饭……该死。我发出一声尖叫和几句咒骂，几秒钟内，美里就冲回了厨房。

"Shinji! Are you okay?" She grabs my forearm and takes a look at my elbows, "No why'd yaw go and do that?"  
“真嗣！你还好吗？”她抓住我的前臂，检查我的肘部，“你怎么会这么做？”

"I didn't mean to!" of course, Kaji and Asuka soon came in to see my stupidity.  
“我不是故意的！”当然，加持和明日香很快就进来看我的愚蠢行为。

"Ugh… Kaji, can you go get me the bandages? Asuka, get some water…"  
"呃…加持，你能去帮我拿些绷带吗？明日香，弄点水来…"

---

Ten Minutes Later

"So Shinji, tell me, how does it feel to be the biggest idiot in Japan?" I swear, Misato could not have possibly wrapped my arms any tighter. I could barely even feel my fingers anymore!  
"那么真嗣，告诉我，成为日本最大的傻瓜是什么感觉？我发誓，美里不可能把我的手臂包得更紧了。我几乎都感觉不到我的手指了！"

"Asuka, ease up on him. You're dating him, you're eating the dinner he made, and…" Misato smiles wickedly… crap, "You've already gotten a pretty good taste of what he can 'whip up'!" she was met with a spoon being thrown at her and a loud 'MISATO!' coming from Asuka. Misato ducked while she laughed her head off.  
"明日香，对他温柔点。你和他约会，吃着他做的晚餐，而且…"美里邪恶地笑着…糟糕，"你已经尝到了他'调制'的美妙滋味！"她被一个飞来的勺子击中，伴随着明日香的大喊'美里！'。美里一边笑得前仰后合，一边躲开了。

"You can't really make those comments Sato," Kaji took a large bite of his food, "Asuka and Shinji have that to themselves… I used to hold something near and dear," with his eyes closed he smiles, "I USED to be the only one that knew what you looked like na-" before he could finish his sentence Misato punched him in the arm.  
"你不能真的说那些话，佐藤，" 加持咬了一大口食物，"明日香和真嗣有他们自己的秘密……我曾经也有珍视的东西，" 他闭着眼睛微笑，"我曾经是唯一知道你长什么样的人——" 他还没说完，美里就一拳打在了他的手臂上。

"Shut up! We're around kids you asshole!"  
"闭嘴！我们周围有孩子在呢，你这个混蛋！"

"It's okay! We're all mature here, right?" Kaji had a smile on his face. That was one of the happiest men I knew, no matter what was happening. Even during angel attacks he was happy. I suddenly realize something… I looked up to him… I actually saw him as an idol of what I might become.  
"没关系！我们都很成熟，对吧？" 加持脸上带着微笑。他是我认识的最快乐的人之一，无论发生什么。即使在使徒袭击期间，他也是快乐的。我突然意识到一件事……我仰慕他……我真的把他视为我可能成为的偶像。

"Are you two TRYING to give me and Shinji a heart attack? Enough of the embarrassing crap!" Asuka slammed her fist down on the table, sending all of our plates bouncing. Silence envelopes the room and she smiles, "Good, now let's enjoy the meal my Shinji slaved over…" it was just ramen… wait… 'MY Shinji'? I like the sound of that! Kaji took another bite of his meal with a smile, Misato went back to her meal, still blushing, and I tried to take a bite of noodles.  
"你们俩是不是想让我和真嗣心脏病发作？别再搞那些丢人的事了！" 明日香一拳砸在桌上，震得我们的盘子都跳了起来。房间里顿时一片寂静，她微笑道，"很好，现在让我们享用真嗣辛苦做的饭吧……" 其实只是拉面……等等……'我的真嗣'？我喜欢这个称呼！加持又微笑着吃了一口，美里还在脸红地继续用餐，而我则试图夹起面条。

"Need some help eating?" Asuka – for once – was actually being serious.  
"需要帮忙吃饭吗？" 明日香——这次居然真的认真起来了。

"No, I'm good thanks…" I try to get my chopsticks in the bowl, but instead I ended up bumping the bowl, knocking it off the table. Everyone in the room cringed.  
"不用，我没事，谢谢……" 我试图用筷子夹起面条，结果却碰翻了碗，让它从桌上掉了下去。房间里的每个人都皱起了眉头。

"Um… ya need help now?" my eyes were wide with pain and my face was beat red, either from pain or embarrassment.  
“呃…你现在需要帮忙吗？”我的眼睛因疼痛而睁得大大的，脸颊涨得通红，不知是因为疼痛还是尴尬。

"Yes please… for the love of God hurry…" I could barely even hear myself. Damn, I thought I was in pain when Asuka kicked me for telling about our kiss… that was nothing.  
“请快点…看在上帝的份上…”我几乎听不清自己的声音。该死，我以为被明日香因为吻的事踢一脚已经够痛了…那根本不算什么。

"I ain't doin it!" Misato instantly shot up.  
“我不干！”美里立刻站起来。

"I'm… unable to… okay, I just won't do it…" gee, thanks a lot Kaji! I tried to get up on my own, which I did, but I wasn't able to move my arms… damnit…  
"我……没法……好吧，我就不做了……" 哎，真谢谢你啊，加持！我试着自己站起来，确实站起来了，但我手臂动不了……该死……

"Um, guys, this is HOT! Do something!" why did Misato have to tie these so tight?!  
"呃，大家，这太热了！快做点什么！" 为什么美里要把这些绑得这么紧？！

"Asuka, this is all you…" Misato and Kaji say in unison as they go back to their meals.  
"明日香，这都是你的事……" 美里和加持异口同声地说着，继续吃他们的饭。

"ME?!"

"For the love of God! At least someone turn on the shower with cold water! Do SOMETHING!" were they even listening to me?  
“看在上帝的份上！至少有人开个冷水淋浴！做点什么吧！”他们到底有没有在听我说话？

"What's the problem? You're the one dating him, not me. You can look at it as a gift from me to you!"  
“有什么问题吗？是你和他约会，又不是我。你可以把它看作是我送给你的礼物！”

"Then take of these damned bandages! Anything!"  
“那就把这些该死的绷带拆掉！什么都行！”

"Weren't you the one that was saying that we were going too fast?"  
"你不是说我们进展太快了吗？"

"Ple-e-e-e-ease!" I was whining at this point.  
"求-求-求-求你了！" 我这时已经是在哀求了。

"So? You've never listened to me before! Why start now?"  
"那又怎样？你以前从来不听我的！为什么现在要开始？"

"Maybe I want to start!"  
"也许我想开始呢！"

"Let me in Pen-Pen's cooler! I'm burning here!"  
"让我进 Pen-Pen 的冷却器！我快烧起来了！"

"Shut up Shinji! This doesn't concern you!" Asuka yelled at me without looking away from Misato. DOESN'T CONCERN ME?! Who was the one getting him balls burned off right now?!  
"闭嘴，真嗣！这跟你无关！" 明日香对着我大喊，眼睛却没离开过美里。跟我无关？！谁现在正被烧得焦头烂额呢？！"

"Asuka, just rip em' down. You don't have to look," Kaji still had his eyes closed in a wisdom smile. With a sigh, Asuka walks over to me and does as she was instructed to without looking, "Um… I didn't mean in front of us…"  
"明日香，直接撕掉就行了。你不用看，" 加持依旧闭着眼睛，带着一种智者的微笑。叹了口气，明日香走到我身边，按照指示没有看就撕了下来，"呃…我不是说在我们面前…"

"Son of a bitch!" I jet towards my room… or try at least. With the pants still around my ankles, I only make it a two steps, five hops, and one fall… onto that God forsaken sofa. I let out a sigh of relief as I feel the burning sensation disappear.  
"该死的！" 我冲向我的房间…至少是试图。由于裤子还在脚踝处，我只走了两步，跳了五下，然后摔倒…在那该死的沙发上。我松了一口气，因为感觉到那灼热感消失了。

"Don't like that feeling kid? Then don't sleep around… clap's gonna get ya if you do…" I heard Kaji chuckle slightly.  
"不喜欢那种感觉吗，孩子？那就别到处乱睡…要是这样，掌声会找上你的…" 我听到加持轻声笑了一下。

---

12:00 AM

"I'm not doing it!"  
"我不干！"

"Well neither am I!"  
"我也是！"

"Sorry… but the only balls I'm interested in are rice balls…" I hear Kaji head into Misato's room. they have been arguing on who's going to get me out of the sofa for three hours now. At this point, I was willing to sleep in here.  
"抱歉……但我只对饭团感兴趣……" 我听到 Kaji 走进了美里房间。他们已经争论谁来把我从沙发上弄起来三个小时了。到了这个地步，我宁愿在这里睡一晚。

"Well I'm going to bed, you can leave your boyfriend here if you want!" with Misato storming off, I hear a slamming door. With a 'hmph', Asuka storms off to her room. Actually, I was just fine here. I could finally get some sleep now.  
“我要去睡觉了，你可以把你的男朋友留在这里！”美里气冲冲地离开，我听到一声重重的关门声。伴随着一声‘哼’，明日香也冲进了她的房间。实际上，我在这里挺好的。现在终于可以好好睡一觉了。

---

1:00 AM

"Shinji," I wake up to a slight nudging of my exposed shoulder, "You awake?" it sounded like Asuka, but I obviously couldn't see.  
“真嗣，”我感觉到露出的肩膀被轻轻推了一下，“你醒着吗？”听起来像是明日香，但我显然看不见。

"Uh huh…" was all I could say. I just wanted to sleep! I was fine here!  
“嗯……”我只能这么回答。我只想睡觉！我在这里很好！

"I couldn't sleep knowing that you were out here trapped. Hold on, I'll get you out…" with a sigh, she flips down the seat. I fall out and see her covering her eyes sitting on the floor, "Now go get dressed… hurry up, I'm tired…" with a smile, I head for my room in only my shirt… how the hell was I going to get dressed?  
"知道你被困在这里，我怎么也睡不着。坚持住，我来救你出去……" 她叹了口气，把座位翻下来。我摔了出来，看到她坐在地板上捂着眼睛，"现在去穿衣服……快点，我累了……" 我笑着，只穿着衬衫朝我的房间走去……我他妈怎么穿衣服？

"Ah screw it…" I catch the side of the bandage on the corner of my dresser and tear them off. The burns weren't even that bad! First degree at the worst! I roll my eyes as I put on a new pair of shorts. I go back out into the living room to see Asuka standing there staring at me, "Thanks for the help," I walk up next to her and give her a soft kiss on the cheek, "Sleep good," I start to walk off, but as I do she grabs my wrist and makes me face her.  
"啊，算了……" 我抓住绷带的一角，从梳妆台边上撕了下来。烧伤根本不严重！最严重也就是一度烧伤！我翻了个白眼，穿上了一条新短裤。我回到客厅，看到明日香站在那里盯着我，"谢谢你的帮助，" 我走到她身边，轻轻吻了她的脸颊，"睡个好觉，" 我正要走开，但她抓住了我的手腕，让我面对她。

"Listen… I got to thinking about what Misato said…" she guides me into her room and closes the door, "I think she could be right. What if it ever did get that far?" I would be jumping with joy…  
"听着……我在想美里说的话……" 她把我带进她的房间，关上门，"我觉得她可能是对的。如果真的到了那一步怎么办？" 我会高兴得跳起来……

"Well, she still gave me the condom to carry around. Don't worry about it, we're not going to get that far for a LONG time, okay?" did I just say that? What am I, gay?!  
"好吧，她还是把避孕套塞给我带着。别担心，我们不会那么快走到那一步的，很长时间内都不会，好吗？"我刚才是这么说的吗？我这是怎么了，难道是同性恋？！

"But I really think that if Misato hadn't been home…" she took a long pause, "I just don't want anything to happen that I'll regret…" what would have happened if Misato wasn't home?! Damn you Misato!  
"但我觉得，如果美里不在家……"她停顿了很久，"我只是不想发生任何我会后悔的事……"如果美里不在家会发生什么？！该死的美里！

"You know we would've stopped ourselves before it got to that. Just forget about it," with a wave, I start to head out of her room, "Night Asuka, see ya in the morning…"  
"你知道我们会在那之前停下来的。忘了这事吧，"我挥了挥手，开始离开她的房间，"晚安，明日香，明早见……"

"Good night…" something more then just the whole sex thing was on her mind, "I lov… night Shinji…" my brain was screaming at me to stop walking, but my legs just kept on moving.  
"晚安…" 她心里想的不仅仅是那件事，"我…晚安，真嗣…" 我的大脑尖叫着让我停下脚步，但我的双腿却不停地向前移动。

A/N- Not too much to say here as always. Other then that last line, nothing too exciting happened. Hope you liked the 'talk' that Misato had with Shinji. See what happens in the next chapter; Toji's A Moron, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记- 这里没什么太多要说的。除了最后那句话，没什么特别刺激的事情发生。希望你喜欢美里和真嗣的'谈话'。下一章chapter见；东治是个笨蛋，在那之前，继续加油吧！

A/A/N- Okay, I really can't keep up with the reviews. You guys are posting fifteen reviews by the time I have two pages written on the next chapter! Sorry, but I'm going to have to make another change. On the average, you guys are giving me eighteen reviews per chapter. So to help me with time, the new limit is eighteen. Sorry about this, but I seriously need at least SOME time to write.  
作者/作者/笔记- 好吧，我真的跟不上评论的速度了。你们在我写完两页下一章chapter的时候已经发了十五条评论了！抱歉，但我不得不再次做出改变。平均来说，你们每章chapter给我十八条评论。所以为了帮我节省时间，新的限制是十八条。对此感到抱歉，但我真的需要至少一些时间来写作。

### Chapter 7 Toji's A Moron

Misato's Apartment – Morning  
美里小姐的公寓 – 早晨

"Shinji! I'm going to start beating on you when you don't wake up!" I hear yelling, then I feel a kick to my hips, "Wake up already!" I open my eyes to see Asuka hovering over me with her hands on her hips.  
"真嗣！你再不醒我就要开始揍你了！" 我听到喊声，接着感到臀部被踢了一脚，"快醒醒！" 我睁开眼睛，看到明日香双手叉腰俯视着我。

"Huh? Oh… sorry…" I drag myself out of my sheet-less bed and walk over to the closet, "You gonna watch?" with a 'humph', she storms out of the room. Man I love that! It gets her to leave faster then Toji at school! When I finished getting dressed, I walk out into the living room to see Pen-Pen watching TV and drinking a beer. Yep, that was Misato's pet.  
"啊？哦……对不起……" 我拖着身子从没有床单的床上爬起来，走向衣柜，"你要看着吗？" 她哼了一声，气冲冲地离开了房间。天哪，我太喜欢这招了！这比学校里的东治还快让她离开！穿好衣服后，我走进客厅，看到企鹅潘-潘正在看电视喝啤酒。没错，这就是美里小姐的宠物。

"See ya kids!" I hear Misato yell from her room. Out of nowhere, Asuka comes up behind me and grabs my wrist. She then drags me out of the apartment without a word. When we reached the street, she spoke up.  
"再见，孩子们！" 我听到美里从她的房间里喊道。突然间，明日香不知从哪儿冒出来，抓住我的手腕。她一言不发地把我从公寓里拖了出去。当我们到达街上时，她开口了。

"Toji's a moron! Do you want to hear what he did to Hikari last night? She called me in tears! I could barely understand her she was crying so hard!" what could Toji have possibly done to make her cry like that?  
"东治真是个白痴！你想听听他昨晚对光做了什么吗？她哭着给我打电话！她哭得那么厉害，我几乎听不清她在说什么！" 东治到底做了什么让她哭成那样？

"What did he do?" I had a concerned look on my face. If anything could have made Hikari that upset, I knew that Toji screwed up big.  
"他做了什么？" 我脸上露出了关切的表情。如果有什么能让光如此难过，我知道东治肯定闯了大祸。

"Last night at the movies, he took her to see some romance that she wanted to see. That went okay, but when he took her home, he forced himself on her. She said that he made her go pretty far. She didn't say exactly what he did, but to make her that bad…" Asuka actually sounded worried for once.  
"昨晚在电影院，他带她去看了一部她想看的爱情片。那还算顺利，但当他送她回家时，他强迫了她。她说他让她做了相当过分的事。她没具体说是什么，但让她那么难受……" 明日香这次真的听起来很担心。

"Do you think she's okay?"  
"你觉得她还好吗？"

"Like hell she is! I've never heard her like that before! But knowing Hikari, she'll still come to school. Listen, I want you to find out what he did to her." great, how was I pulled into this?  
"她才不好呢！我从没听过她那样！但知道光，她还是会来学校的。听着，我要你查出他对她做了什么。" 天啊，我怎么卷进这种事了？

"Me?! Why can't you do it?" she slaps me on the back of the head.  
"我？！你为什么不能做？" 她在我后脑勺上拍了一下。

"Because I'll be the one with Hikari! Now be a good boy and do as you're told. That's no fair! Sure, I care about Hikari, but I also know that if Toji got pissed at me, he'd kick my ass!  
"因为我要和光在一起！现在乖乖听话，照我说的做。这不公平！当然，我关心光，但我也知道如果真嗣对我发火，他会揍我的！

"Fine…" damn you! Stand up to her you spineless wimp! "I'll do what I can." YOU SUCK!  
"好吧……" 该死的！站起来反抗她啊，你这个没骨气的懦夫！ "我会尽力的。" 你真差劲！

"Okay, we'll be at the school pretty soon. You go to wherever you three hang out and I'll find Hikari," when we finally got to the school, Hikari wasn't in her normal spot out in front. With a shrug, Asuka just follows me to our classroom. When we walk in, we instantly see Kensuke quivering in the corner, Rei in her normal spot, Hikari in her desk, and Toji hovering over it talking.  
"好了，我们很快就到学校了。你们三个去平时待的地方，我去找光。"当我们终于到达学校时，光并没有像往常一样站在前面。阿斯卡耸了耸肩，跟着我来到教室。一进门，我们立刻看到真希在角落里颤抖，丽在她的固定位置，光坐在她的座位上，而冬二正俯身对她说话。

"Come on! I didn't do anything!"  
"拜托！我什么都没做！"

"You didn't do anything?!" Hikari got fire in her eyes, "I damn near called rape!" right as those words hit our ears; Asuka took off and tackled him to the ground.  
"你什么都没做？！"光眼中燃起了怒火，"我差点就报警说强奸了！"话音刚落，阿斯卡就冲了上去，将他扑倒在地。

"What the fuck is you problem?!" Asuka yelled at him, "What did you do to her?!"  
"你他妈有什么毛病？！" 明日香对他吼道，"你对绫波做了什么？！"

"He reached down my shirt!" Asuka instantly punched Toji across the face.  
"他把手伸进我衣服里了！" 明日香立刻一拳打在东治脸上。

"You did WHAT?!" she punched him again.  
"你做了什么？！" 她又给了他一拳。

"Will you get off of me? Hikari! Why don't you tell her the whole story, huh?" she kept quiet, "Fine then, I will! When we got out of the movie theater, she asked me to take her home. When we got there, she let me kiss her – and don't you even try to deny that!" Hikari still kept quiet, "While we were kissing, things got a little elevated…" Asuka cut him off.  
"你能从我身上下来吗？光！你为什么不告诉她整个故事，嗯？"她保持沉默，"好吧，那我来！当我们从电影院出来时，她让我送她回家。到了那里，她让我吻了她——你别想否认这一点！"光依然沉默，"当我们接吻时，事情变得有点激烈……"明日香打断了他。

"So you decided to take advantage of that, right?" just then, the bell rang and the classroom was soon flooded with students, all staring at Asuka and Toji, "What the hell are you looking at?!" she punched him one last time as she got up. All the kids scrambled to their seats as the teacher walked in.  
"所以你就趁机占便宜了，对吧？"就在这时，铃声响起，教室很快涌入了学生，所有人都盯着明日香和东治，"你们看什么看？!"她起身时又揍了他一拳。所有孩子都赶紧回到座位上，老师走了进来。

"Miss Souryu, you can beat on Mister Suzahara later, for now you have a lesson," Asuka looked at Toji and cracked her knuckles. Toji let his head fall onto the table. After hearing what he did to Hikari, I don't blame him for being nervous. Hell, I wanted a swing or two! I had to make sure we were getting the whole story. I threw a pencil at him and tapped on my lap top, telling him to get on.  
"绫波老师，你可以稍后再教训铃原同学，现在你有课要上，"明日香看着东治，活动了一下手指。东治把头埋在桌上。听了他对光做的事后，我不怪他紧张。见鬼，我都想揍他几拳！我得确保我们了解整个故事。我朝他扔了一支铅笔，敲了敲笔记本电脑，示意他过来。

You have entered room '**Tell me or I'll sick Asuka on you'**  
你已进入房间 '不说我就让明日香对付你'

**Hornyeva**- God mother fucking damn it…  
Hornyeva- 该死的…

**Hornyeva** has left the room.  
Hornyeva 已离开房间。

**Thejudge** has entered the room.  
法官已经进入房间。

**Thejudge-** oh, haha toji. Now, tell me what happened  
法官——哦，哈哈，透司。现在，告诉我发生了什么

**SPORTman**- I already told you… drop it…  
运动侠——我已经告诉你了……别再提了……

**Thejudge**- like hell I will! Asuka said that Hikari was sobbing over the phone last night! What could you have done to make her like that? Not reaching down her shirt. I don't care how kept to herself she is, she wouldn't act like that just because of that. Seriously Toji, tell me.  
Thejudge- 想得美！明日香说昨晚 Hikari 在电话里哭得厉害！你到底做了什么让她那样？总不会是把手伸进她衣服里吧。我才不管她平时有多自闭，不至于因为这点事就那样。说真的，Toji，告诉我。

**SPORTman**- but that's the thing, I didn't do that!  
SPORTman- 问题就在这儿，我根本没那么做！

**Thejudge**- oh, so she's the liar in all of this? Okay, if you didn't do that, then what did you do? Reach up her skirt or something? I'm not in the mood to joke around right now.  
Thejudge- 哦，所以这一切都是她在撒谎？行，如果你没那么做，那你做了什么？摸她裙子还是别的什么？我现在可没心情开玩笑。

**SPORTman**- …

**Thejudge**- wait…

**SPORTman**- …

**Thejudge**- you'd better be joking  
法官大人- 您最好是在开玩笑

**SPORTman**- …

**Thejudge**- YOU ASSHOLE! WHAT THE FUCK WAS GOING ON IN THAT TWISTED LITTLE HEAD OF YOURS?!?!  
法官大人- 你这个混蛋！你那扭曲的小脑袋里到底在搞什么鬼？！？！

**SPORTman**- …

**Thejudge**- what the hell is your problem?!  
法官大人- 你到底有什么问题？！

**SPORTman**- …

**Thejudge**- God… what the hell is wrong with you Toji? Hold on, you're not getting off of this.  
Thejudge- 上帝…Toji 你到底怎么了？坚持住，你别想就这么算了。

**REDcutie** has entered the room.  
REDcutie 进入了房间。

**NERV** has entered the room.  
NERV 进入了房间。

**Bluemetal** has entered the room.  
Bluemetal 进入了房间。

**CLASSrep** has entered the room.  
班级代表已进入房间。

**REDcutie**- hey shinji! Oh, everyone's here…

**Bluemetal**- Greetings pilots Ikari and Souryu…  
Bluemetal - 向驾驶员碇真嗣和惣流致以问候…

**CLASSrep**- why the hell is toji here?!  
班级代表- 为什么东治会在这里？!

**NERV**- did I miss something here?  
NERV- 我是不是错过了什么？

**Thejudge-** so Toji, why don't you tell everyone what you told me?  
法官- 那么东治，你为什么不告诉大家你告诉我的事呢？

**REDcutie**- yes, why don't you?  
REDcutie- 是的，你为什么不呢？

**CLASSrep-** because he's a coward!  
CLASSrep- 因为他是个懦夫！

**Bluemetal**- may I ask what is wrong?  
Bluemetal- 请问有什么问题吗？

**REDcutie**- do I have to spell it out for you? Toji and Hikari went on a date, he acted like a pervert, Hikari is now pissed. Got it?  
REDcutie- 我得给你详细解释吗？冬二和光约会了，他表现得像个变态，光现在很生气。明白了吗？

**Bluemetal**- … got it…

**REDcutie**- good. Now back to Toji. What did he do?  
REDcutie- 好。现在回到冬二。他做了什么？

**Thejudge**- okay, since he's not gonna say, I will. He never reached down Hikari's shirt. He reached up her skirt.  
Thejudge- 好吧，既然他不说，我来。他并没有把手伸进光的衬衫里。他是把手伸进了她的裙子里。

"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?!?!" Asuka flung her chair at his head, and hit the big-ass target. She leaped over her desk and landed on top of him, "You'd better be joking!" she punched him across the face.  
"你他妈干了什么？！？！" 明日香将她的椅子朝他的头扔去，正中那个大目标。她跳过桌子，落在他身上，"你最好是在开玩笑！" 她一拳打在他的脸上。

"Miss Souryu! Take your seat!"  
"惣流小姐！回到你的座位上！"

"No, I recommend that YOU take your seat unless you want this!" she punched him again. The teacher ran back to his desk and sat down, "Do you mind telling me what exactly the hell you were thinking?!" the whole class was staring at Asuka and Toji, "And to the rest of you, I recommend that you leave…" nobody moved, "NOW!" the class was empty in half a second aside from me, Hikari, Asuka and Toji.  
"不，我建议你回到你的座位上，除非你想要这个！" 她又打了他一拳。老师跑回自己的桌子坐下，"你介意告诉我你到底在想什么吗？！" 全班都在盯着明日香和冬二，"至于你们其他人，我建议你们离开……" 没人动，"现在！" 除了我、光、明日香和冬二，教室在半秒钟内空无一人。

"Get off of me! And enough of the damn punching, it hurts!" she punched him again.  
“从我身上滚开！还有，别再打我了，疼死了！”她又揍了他一拳。

"Oh, it hurts? I'm so sorry. Deal with it!"  
“哦，疼吗？真抱歉。忍着吧！”

"Um… so Suzahara… touched Hokari?" Rei was still confused about this. She walked over to Toji and looked down on him; "Hmm…" she then kicked him in the shoulder… hard… "You should try and respect women better…" with that, she walked out of the room.  
“呃……所以铃原……碰了光？”丽对此仍感困惑。她走到真嗣身边，低头看着他；“嗯……”随后她用力踢了他的肩膀一脚……“你应该学会更好地尊重女性……”说完，她走出了房间。

"What am I, every ones punching bag?! Quit hitting me!" Asuka punched him again, "Stop it!" I couldn't help but chuckle a little at that. The fact that his voice cracked didn't help either.  
"我是什么，大家的出气筒吗？！别再打我了！" 明日香又揍了他一拳，"住手！" 我不禁轻笑出声。他的声音变得沙哑，这也没帮上什么忙。

"Asuka let him up. He obviously doesn't see anything wrong with what he did, and we can't change that. Just forget about it," Hikari finally spoke up.  
"明日香让他站了起来。他显然不认为自己做错了什么，我们也改变不了这一点。就当没发生过吧，" 班长终于开口了。

"But look what he did to you! Not only did he make you cry, but now he's acting like what he did was okay!" his cheek was starting to swell and turn bright red.  
"但看看他对你做了什么！不仅让你哭了，现在他还表现得好像自己没错一样！" 他的脸颊开始肿胀，变得通红。

"Just let him up…" she sat back down at her desk, "And let everyone back in, we have to get back to the lesson," with a sigh and one more punch, Asuka got up off of Toji.  
"就让他起来吧…" 她重新坐回桌前，"然后让大家回来，我们得继续上课，"伴随着一声叹息和最后一拳，明日香从真嗣身上站了起来。

"Will you stop with that?!" a few kids poked their heads in wanting to see what was happening.  
"你能别闹了吗？！" 几个孩子探头探脑地想看看发生了什么。

"You all can come in now, and feel free to hit Suzahara," Asuka took her seat with a smile. The rest of the class did the same and the teacher slowly made his way back to his desk.  
"你们现在可以进来了，顺便可以揍揍铃原，" 明日香带着微笑坐回座位。其他同学也纷纷落座，老师缓缓走回自己的讲台。

"Um… may I return to the lesson now?" he was actually trembling!  
"嗯……我现在可以回到课堂了吗？" 他实际上在发抖！

"You may…"

After School – Outside Of the School  
放学后 —— 校外

"I know that you were pissed at him… but did you have to do THAT?" what she did at lunch was just wrong.  
"我知道你对他很生气……但你非得那么做吗？" 她午餐时做的事真是错的。

"Yeah, I felt that it was necessary. He shouldn't be using them anyway," we all knew that, but did she have to use a steel-toed shoe?  
“是啊，我觉得有必要。反正他也不该用那些东西，”我们都知道这一点，但她非得用钢头鞋吗？

"If you say so… you think Hikari's okay? I'm worried about her," Asuka let out a deep sigh.  
“如果你这么说的话……你觉得光子还好吗？我有点担心她，”明日香深深叹了口气。

"I really don't know… she was sobbing last night, and yet today she seemed fine." We walked in silence for awhile, and then she broke the silence, "I have an idea. How about you go to Toji's, and I go to Hikari's and we try and resolve this. I'm not saying get them back together, I'm saying that we need to make sure he won't pull anything like that again." Then why did I have to go to Toji's? Hikari was the one that was hurting!  
“我真的不知道……她昨晚还在哭泣，但今天看起来却没事。”我们沉默地走了一会儿，然后她打破了沉默，“我有个主意。你去找真嗣，我去光子那里，我们试着解决这个问题。我不是说要让他们复合，我是说我们需要确保他不会再做出那种事。”那为什么非得我去真嗣那里？明明是光子在受伤！

"Um… okay… if you think it'll help…" spineless ass wipe…  
"嗯…好吧…如果你觉得有用的话…" 没骨气的软蛋…

"It will. Okay, talk to you later, Hikari's is right here," with a wave, she takes a left and leaves my sight. I walk to Toji's in silence, trying to act out what is going to happen when I get there.  
"会的。好吧，回头再聊，光里就在那边，" 她挥了挥手，向左一拐，消失在我的视线中。我默默地走向 Toji 家，试图演练到达那里时会发生的事情。

A/N- Anything in italics will be a circumstance Shinji is thinking about when he gets to Toji's.  
作者注- 任何用斜体表示的内容将是真嗣到达 Toji 家时所思考的情况。

"_Toji, seriously, why'd you do that?" he just shrugs._  
“冬二，说真的，你干嘛那样做？”他只是耸了耸肩。

"_I'm fourteen, why do ya think?"_  
“我才十四岁，你以为呢？”

Nah, he's not that weird.  
不，他没那么奇怪。

"_You really shouldn't have gone that far, it was only your first date." He chuckles and then points at me._  
"你真的不该走那么远，这毕竟只是你们的第一次约会。" 他轻笑一声，然后指着我。

"_You're saying that to ME? You're the one that made out with the demon! Tell me Shinji, how does she taste? Don't tell me you don't know! You probably still are tasting that!" did he have to be so nasty about it? With a certain bird making an appearance, I leave his place._  
"你居然对我说这种话？你自己才是和那个恶魔亲热的人！告诉我，真嗣，她味道如何？别告诉我你不知道！你大概现在还在回味吧！" 他非得这么刻薄吗？随着某只鸟的出现，我离开了他的住处。

I pray to God that doesn't happen. By that time, I'm, in front of his house. With a deep breath, I knock on the door.  
我祈祷那不会发生。到那时，我已经站在他家门前。深吸一口气，我敲响了门。

"Ya need something?" I jump out of my skin and turn around to see Toji standing there.  
“你有什么事吗？”我吓得跳了起来，转身看到东治站在那里。

"Oh! Sorry… I-I needed to talk with you…"  
“哦！对不起……我……我需要和你谈谈……”

"Ugh! Not this Hikari crap again! Look, will you just leave it alone already? It's really starting to get on my nerves," he pushes me aside and walks into his house. Getting on HIS nerves? How did he think we were feeling?  
“呃！别再提那个光的事了！听着，你就不能别再提了吗？这真的开始让我烦了，”他把我推到一边，走进他的房子。他烦了？他以为我们是什么感觉？

"Hey! How can you be so uncaring about this? Hikari is hurting right now, and you're acting like it's nothing! You do know that if she wanted to, Hikari could take you to court, right? But no, being the sweet girl she is she's actually letting this go! I don't see how she ever liked you; all you think of is yourself!" I was met with a swift punch to the stomach.  
“嘿！你怎么能对这事如此漠不关心？光现在正痛苦着，你却表现得像没事一样！你知道如果她愿意，光完全可以把你告上法庭，对吧？但她没有，因为她是个善良的女孩，实际上她选择放过这件事！我真不明白她怎么会喜欢你；你只考虑你自己！”我随即被狠狠地打了一拳在肚子上。

"Shut the hell up!" he slams the door in my face. I was kneeling over in pain as he left me outside. When I catch my breath, I begin to walk away from his house and heading to Misato's. Oh yeah, that accomplished a lot. All I was left with was an aching stomach and enough adrenaline to challenge a bull elephant. I haven't been this mad in awhile, especially not at a friend. Well, I wouldn't exactly call him a friend at this point, more of a guy I just knew. When I get home, I see that no one is home. Misato left a note on the door that said something about work; I didn't really read it too carefully. Frankly, I didn't care. I just waited on the sofa – carefully I might add – and wait for Asuka to come home. I start to hear an occasional 'flip' behind me. Out of curiosity, I take a look and see Pen-Pen slowly walking towards me. He immediately jumps under the table when I see him.  
"闭嘴！" 他猛地在我面前摔上门。我痛苦地跪倒在地，他把我留在了门外。当我缓过气来，我开始离开他的房子，朝美里那里走去。哦，是的，这真是大有成效。我只剩下一个疼痛的肚子和足以挑战一头公象的肾上腺素。我已经有一段时间没有这么生气了，尤其是对一个朋友。好吧，我现在不会把他称为朋友，更像是刚刚认识的人。当我回到家时，发现家里没人。美里在门上留了张纸条，说什么工作的事；我并没有仔细看。老实说，我不在乎。我只是小心翼翼地——我得补充一下——坐在沙发上，等待明日香回家。我开始偶尔听到身后有‘啪’的声音。出于好奇，我回头一看，看到 Pen-Pen 慢慢地向我走来。我一看到他，他就立刻跳到桌子底下。

"You need something?" he slowly peeks out from under the table, "Hungry?" he once again slowly made his way over to me and hopped on the sofa next to me. After a few minutes of simply staring at each other, he put up a flipper out in front of him aiming for me.  
"你需要什么吗？" 他慢慢地从桌子底下探出头来，"饿了？" 他再次慢慢地向我走来，跳到沙发上，坐在我旁边。几分钟后，我们只是互相凝视着，他伸出一只鳍状肢，朝我伸过来。

"Squawk…" he actually sounded like he was talking. Was he trying to shake my hand?  
“嘎…” 他听起来真的像是在说话。他是在试图跟我握手吗？

"Um… what are you doing?" I see him start to sweat, "Are you trying to make up with me?" he slowly nods. I smile and take his 'hand', "Okay, truce. But no more of that porno in my backpack, okay?" I think I saw a smile as he nodded, "Now, do you want to watch Jerry Springer?" he shook his head furiously; "Just messin' with ya!" he glared at me and grabbed the remote.  
“呃… 你在干什么？” 我看到他开始冒汗，“你是想跟我讲和吗？” 他缓缓点头。我笑了笑，握住他的‘手’，“好吧，休战。但别再往我书包里放那种色情片了，好吗？” 我好像看到他点头时笑了，“现在，你想看《杰瑞·斯普林格秀》吗？” 他拼命摇头；“逗你玩呢！” 他瞪了我一眼，抓起遥控器。

Half an Hour Later

We have been watching some nature show for thirty minutes now, and nothing interesting yet has happened. Just a bunch of penguins walking around… wait…  
我们已经看了三十分钟的自然节目，但还没有什么有趣的事情发生。只是一群企鹅走来走去… 等等…

"I'm home!" Asuka come bursting through the door with a smile on her face, "I got the best news! Guess what Hikari just got done doing?" she sure seemed excited about something.  
"我回来了！" 明日香带着满脸笑容冲进门，"我有个天大的好消息！猜猜光刚刚做了什么？" 她显然对某件事兴奋不已。

"Um… Toji?" okay, bad joke.

"No you pervert! She just told her dad and now he's over at Toji's right now!" holy crap… Hikari's father was the meanest guy on the face of the earth. He was at least seven feet, and was solid muscle. He was always really protective of Hikari, but in this circumstance, he'll probably kill Toji!  
"不，你这个变态！她刚告诉了她爸，现在他就在托基家！" 天哪…光的父亲可是地球上最凶悍的人。他至少有七英尺高，浑身肌肉。他一直对光保护有加，但在这个情况下，他很可能会杀了托基！

"Wow… hope Toji can run fast…"  
"哇…希望托基跑得够快…"

"Yeah, about that, how'd it go?"  
“是啊，说到这个，情况怎么样？”

"Um… let's just say he hits like a girl…" unfortunately for me that girl was Asuka…  
“呃……这么说吧，他打起来像个女孩……”不幸的是，那个女孩是明日香……

"Damn! He hit you? Did ya hit him back?" I would never last a second in a fight against him.  
“该死！他打你了？你回手了吗？”我跟他打一秒都撑不住。

"Um… no…"

"Ugh! You're such a wimp! You could easily take him, and you know that!" could I? I really don't see that… "You know what I'm going to start to do?" I see something coming… and I really don't like it, "From now on, I'm going to train you every day to fight, got it?"  
"呃！你真是太胆小了！你明明可以轻松打败他，你自己也知道！" 我可以吗？我真的不这么认为… "你知道我要开始做什么了吗？" 我感觉有什么要来了…我真的不喜欢这样，"从现在开始，我要每天训练你战斗，明白了吗？"

"But why? I don't care if I'm able to fight…"  
"但为什么？我不在乎自己能不能打架…"

"Well you should! You got muscle, so you should at least be able to defend yourself!"  
"你应该在乎！你有肌肉，所以至少应该能保护自己！"

"And what makes you think that you can teach me?" she glares at me, "Hold on! That came out wrong! What I meant was, how will you do it? You haven't exactly taken any classes yourself." She's strong though, I'll give her that.  
"你凭什么认为你能教我？" 她瞪着我，"等等！这话听起来不对！我的意思是，你会怎么做？你自己也没上过什么课。" 不过，她确实很强，这点我得承认。

"True, but at least I know how to throw a punch and kick!" I know that from experience… "Quit fighting it Shinji, you're doing it everyday after school, got it?" but I don't wanna!  
"没错，但至少我知道怎么出拳和踢腿！" 这是我从经验中学到的… "别抗拒了，真嗣，你每天放学后都在做这件事，明白吗？" 但我不想啊！

"But-" she cut me off.  
"但是——" 她打断了我。

"Ah! No debate, you're doing it. Well start tomorrow," I can hear Pen-Pen holding back from laughter.  
“啊！不用争了，你正在做。好吧，从明天开始，”我能听到 Pen-Pen 强忍着不笑出声。

"Fine…" he busts out laughing. He falls to the floor laughing uncontrollably.  
“好吧……”他突然大笑起来。他笑得倒在地上，无法自控。

"What's up with him? Is he drunk or something?" no, he just finds my pain amusing.  
“他怎么了？是喝醉了吗？”不，他只是觉得我的痛苦很有趣。

"Yeah, he is. Look, if you're going to make me do this, you have to do something for me…" she perked up. This was going to be good, "You have to let me teach you to cook," she glared at me.  
"是啊，他是。听着，如果你非要我这么做，你得为我做点什么……" 她来了精神。这会很有趣，"你得让我教你做饭，" 她瞪着我。

"And what's wrong with my cooking?"  
"我的厨艺有什么问题吗？"

"Nothing!" aside from the fact that she never cooked, "Just I could teach you some good recipes. I know a few German dishes…" trying to convince her, I throw in her main bragging right.  
"没什么！" 除了她从不做饭这个事实，"只是我可以教你一些好菜谱。我知道几道德国菜……" 试图说服她，我提到了她的主要炫耀点。

"And why haven't you made them may I ask?" I just keep on digging…  
"那为什么你还没做呢，我可以问一下吗？" 我继续挖坑……

"Um… because… I wanted you to make them." Liar, you didn't make them because you don't have any, "So how about it? You teach me to fight; I help you with your cooking. Deal?"  
"呃……因为……我想让你来做。" 骗子，你不做是因为你没有，"那怎么样？你教我战斗；我帮你做饭。成交吗？"

"Fine… when will we do the cooking?" she sits down next to me.  
"好吧……我们什么时候开始做饭？" 她在我旁边坐下。

"How about every Thursday and Sunday?" those were her days to cook anyway.  
"每周四和周日怎么样？" 反正那些日子也是她做饭的日子。

"Okay…" all that could be heard from that point on was a certain penguin trying to regain his composure, "Damn it!" she suddenly shot up.  
"好吧…" 从那时起，只能听到某只企鹅试图恢复镇定的声音，"该死！" 她突然站了起来。

"Are you okay?" that scared the hell out of me!  
"你还好吗？" 那可把我吓坏了！

"Yeah, I just forgot something. You know how I told you about my idea for after the movies last night?" of course I did!  
“是啊，我刚忘了件事。你知道我昨晚看完电影后跟你提的那个想法吗？”当然记得！”

"Yeah… I kinda liked it too…" she rolls her eyes.  
“嗯……我也挺喜欢的……”她翻了个白眼。

"That wasn't my plan! Look, you got the condom that Misato gave to you?" with a raised eyebrow, I pull it out of my pocket, "Good, give it here," with an evil smile, she rips it open, "She's so worried about us having sex, so I want to see what would happen if she really thought that we did do it!" she unrolls the condom.  
“那不是我的计划！听着，你拿到美里给你的那个避孕套了吗？”我挑了挑眉，从口袋里掏出来，“好，给我，”她邪恶地笑着，撕开包装，“她那么担心我们发生关系，我想看看如果她真以为我们做了会发生什么！”她展开了避孕套。

"Asuka… what are you doing?" she holds it in front of me and smiles.  
"明日香…你在干什么？"她把东西举到我面前，微笑着。

"Freaking out Misato. Here, hack a logy in it. I wanna see just how mad Misato can get!"  
"让美里抓狂。来，往里面加点料。我想看看美里能有多生气！"

"Um… are you sure we should be doing this?"  
"呃…你确定我们应该这么做吗？"

"Just do it!" I rolled my eyes as I followed her command. With a smile she walks into her room and comes back a few seconds later without the condom, "There, now we can relax." She sits down next to me and lays her head on my shoulder. I just keep quiet about what we just did, because truthfully, I kinda liked the idea. After a few minutes of watching that damn nature show, she speaks up, "Why are we watching this?"  
"就去做吧！" 我翻了个白眼，但还是照她说的做了。她笑着走进房间，几秒钟后又出来了，手里没有避孕套，"好了，现在我们可以放松了。" 她在我旁边坐下，把头靠在我的肩膀上。我什么也没说，因为我们刚刚做的事，说实话，我有点喜欢这个主意。看了几分钟那该死的自然节目后，她开口了，"我们为什么要看这个？"

"Pen-Pen was. Here, turn it to whatever you want," I hand her the remote and with a smile, she turns off the TV.  
"Pen-Pen 在这儿。你想看什么就转台吧，" 我把遥控器递给她，她笑着关掉了电视。

"Misato's not home, right?" I think I saw where this was going…  
"美里不在家，对吧？" 我想我知道这要往哪儿发展了……

"Um… no…" she turns to me and wraps her arms around my neck.  
"呃…没有…" 她转向我，双臂环住我的脖子。

"Is Kaji here?" she leans in until we're a few centimeters apart.  
"加持在这里吗？" 她倾身靠近，直到我们之间只剩几厘米的距离。

"No…"

"Good…" she leaned in and our lips met once again. Within a few seconds, I was lying on my back and she was hovering over me, kissing me the whole time. The kiss was just as deep as the one last night, and she was being just as aggressive with it. I couldn't help but shudder at the thought that Misato or Kaji would walk in right now, but I tried to brush it off. We were like this for awhile, half an hour I'd say. The kiss was only broken to catch our breath, and then was quickly started back up again. We didn't even try to go further, even though we both knew that we could have easily. I mean think about it, I was on my back with her on top of me making out. This normally would have led to sex, but we both controlled ourselves. I had to admit, knowing that we were able to do that made me feel mature to an extent. Just as I put my hands on her hips, a certain guardian walks in.  
"好…" 她倾身向前，我们的唇再次相触。几秒钟内，我已仰面躺下，她悬在我上方，始终吻着我。这个吻和昨晚一样深沉，她的攻势同样猛烈。我不禁颤抖，担心美里或加持会突然闯入，但我尽力抛开这个念头。我们这样持续了一段时间，大约半小时。吻只是为了喘口气而短暂中断，随即又迅速继续。我们甚至没有尝试更进一步，尽管我们都知道这很容易。想想看，我仰躺着，她在我上方亲吻。这通常会导向性爱，但我们都控制住了自己。我不得不承认，知道我们能做到这一点，让我感到某种程度的成熟。就在我将手放在她臀部时，某位监护人走了进来。

"I'm hom… okay that's just gross…" Asuka pops up and looks at Misato.  
"我回家了…好吧，这有点恶心…" 明日香突然出现，看着美里。

"Misato! W-What are you doing home so early?" we're busted…  
"美里！你-你怎么这么早就回家了？" 我们被抓包了…"

"I thought I told you two not to do that in here! I don't like to watch fourteen year olds make out, I'm just weird that way!" Asuka was still over me staring at Misato, "And get off of him!" Asuka leaped off of me – damn it by the way – and stood up. I stood up right next to her nervously.  
"我记得我告诉过你们两个不要在这里做那种事！我不喜欢看十四岁的孩子亲热，我就是这么奇怪！" 明日香还压在我身上盯着美里，"还有，从他身上下来！" 明日香跳离我——该死的——然后站了起来。我紧张地站在她旁边。

"Um… hi Misato…" was all I muttered.  
"呃…嗨，美里…" 我只能喃喃道。

"Don't 'hi Misato' me! We just had a talk on this, and yet here you are doing it again! How long were you two like that?" she was switching her glare from me to Asuka.  
"别'嗨，美里'我！我们刚刚才谈过这件事，结果你又来了！你们俩那样多久了？" 她来回瞪着我和明日香。

"Um… about half an hour…" she slapped her forehead.  
"呃…大概半小时…" 她拍了拍自己的额头。

"Ugh! That long? Okay, fine. I'll let this go if you can show me that I can trust you two. Shinji, did you follow what I told you to do? I told you to keep that condom on you, so show me it," ah damn it… both me and Asuka jump a little, "Come on! Whip it out!" we both keep quiet; "Okay you obviously don't have it on you. Where did you put it? Is it even in this apartment?"  
"呃！这么久？好吧，行。如果你能证明我可以信任你们两个，我就放过这事。真嗣，我让你做的事你照做了吗？我让你把那个避孕套带在身上，拿出来给我看看，"啊该死…我和明日香都吓了一跳，"快点！拿出来！"我们俩都保持沉默；"好吧，你显然没带在身上。你放哪儿了？还在这个公寓里吗？"

"Um… yeah…"

"Then tell me where it is!" with closed eyes, Asuka pointed to her room. Misato rolled her eyes and walked into her room. "Ah damn it!" she yelled through the apartment. She comes storming back out and grabs our wrists. She dragged us to her car and threw us in the back seat. Without a word, she started the car and sped off. None of said anything, not even a sound was made. We eventually arrive at NERV. She once again grabs us and drags us to the hospital branch of NERV. "Okay, you two are going to wait here," she sits us down in the waiting area, "I'll be right back," she was still really pissed. When she went out of sight Asuka smiled over at me.  
"那你告诉我它在哪儿！"明日香闭着眼睛指向她的房间。美里翻了个白眼，走进她的房间。"啊该死！"她隔着公寓大喊。她怒气冲冲地走出来，抓住我们的手腕。她把我们拖到她的车旁，扔进后座。一句话也没说，她发动车子疾驰而去。谁也没说话，连一点声音都没发出。我们最终到达了 NERV。她再次抓住我们，把我们拖到 NERV 的医院分部。"好了，你们两个在这里等着，"她让我们坐在等候区，"我马上回来，"她还是很生气。当她消失在视线外时，明日香朝我笑了笑。

"This'll be good…" "这会很有趣…"

Ten Minutes Later

"Misato you suck!" we were back in the car and Asuka was yelling at Misato, "Did you have to make Akagi do that?!"  
"美里，你真差劲！" 我们回到车里，明日香对着美里大喊，"你非得让赤木做那种事吗？！"

"Yes, I did. Maybe you shouldn't pull stunts like that, ever think of that?" Misato smiled as she drove.  
"是的，我必须这么做。也许你以后不该再搞这种小把戏，没想过这一点吗？" 美里一边开车一边微笑着回答。

"Well geez, you could have just asked us! Damn that thing hurts!" truthfully, I had no idea what she was talking about. Ritsuko just came in and asked Asuka to come with her. She came back out a few minutes later with a deep blush.  
"哎呀，你完全可以直接问我们啊！那玩意儿真疼！" 说实话，我完全不知道她在说什么。赤木刚才进来叫明日香跟她走。几分钟后，明日香红着脸回来了。

"Sorry, but I had to make sure…" now I was just lost. I'd rather not know actually, mainly because I had an IDEA of what it might be, and I'd rather not talk about it.  
"对不起，但我必须确认一下…" 现在我完全糊涂了。其实我宁愿不知道，主要是因为我大概猜到了那可能是什么，而我宁愿不谈论这个。

"I know, but damn… and what does she do, keep that thing in a freezer?!" ew…  
"我知道，但该死的…她到底怎么处理那东西的，难道是放在冰箱里？！" 呃…

A/N- There ya go. Okay, if you didn't get that last joke, get out. I'm fourteen and I get it! Anyway, do you think that title of this chapter fit? Do you think Toji will make up for it? Does Akagi keep that thing in a freezer? Find out in the next chapter; That Time, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者注- 就是这样。好吧，如果你没听懂最后一个笑话，那就出去吧。我十四岁都懂了！话说回来，你觉得这个标题《chapter》合适吗？你觉得东治能弥补这一切吗？赤城是不是把那东西放在冰箱里？下集《chapter》揭晓；直到那时，继续保持下去！

### Chapter 8: That Time  
Chapter 8: 那个时刻

One Week Later – Sunday Morning  
一周后 —— 星期天早晨

"So what do you want for breakfast?" I was in the kitchen about to make breakfast. This last week was pretty uneventful. Toji hasn't shown up to school, but Hikari swore that her dad didn't kill him, just beat him up. I have been training with Asuka everyday, and by the end of the night I would be drop dead tired. I had to admit though; even I could tell that she was training me. I was more relaxed, my movements were more like water then an actual body. I think it was acting like a stress reliever for me. She got out of cooking on Thursday, but tonight she's not going to get out of anything.  
“那你想吃什么早餐？” 我站在厨房准备做早餐。过去这一周相当平静。东治没来学校，但光希发誓她爸爸只是揍了他一顿，没杀他。我每天都在和明日香训练，到了晚上我几乎累得要死。不过我得承认；就连我自己也能感觉到她在训练我。我变得更放松了，我的动作更像水流而不是僵硬的躯体。我觉得这对我来说像是一种减压方式。她周四逃掉了做饭，但今晚她可别想逃掉任何事。

"I don't care… just don't poison me!" she woke up in an odd mood this morning. She wasn't joking around; she actually had a harsh voice.  
"我不在乎……只要别给我下毒就行！"她今早醒来心情有些古怪。她不是在开玩笑；她的声音真的很严厉。

"Um… okay…" not knowing what to make, I just throw together some bacon and eggs. Misato was still asleep, so I just throw hers in the microwave. I hand Asuka her plate and she immediately begins to dig in, "How is it?" I sit down across the table from her and start to eat myself.  
"嗯……好吧……"不知道该做什么，我随手煎了些培根和鸡蛋。美里还在睡觉，所以我把她的那份放进微波炉。我把盘子递给明日香，她立刻开始吃起来，"味道怎么样？"我坐在她对面的桌旁，也开始吃自己的。

"Not horrible…" she takes another bite. Was that an insult or a compliment? I really couldn't tell. She finishes way before me and when she does, she goes back into her room.  
"不算糟糕……"她又咬了一口。这是在侮辱还是称赞？我真的分辨不出来。她比我早吃完，然后就回房间去了。

"What's wrong with her?" Misato walked past Asuka with a confused look. She grabbed her breakfast out of the microwave and sat down where Asuka was.  
"她怎么了？" 美里带着困惑的表情从明日香身边走过。她从微波炉里拿出早餐，坐在明日香旁边。

"I don't know, she's acting really weird. She's being really rude today…" suddenly Misato popped up.  
"我不知道，她今天行为真的很奇怪。她今天特别粗鲁……" 突然美里冒了出来。

"Shinji… what day is it?"  
"真嗣……今天是什么日子？"

"Um… the twentieth I think, why?" she slaps her forehead.  
"呃…我想是 20 号吧，怎么了？" 她拍了拍自己的额头。

"Damnit… look, just try not to piss her off for awhile…" what was that supposed to mean? Asuka comes back out of her room in a pair of tight jeans and shirt, "Well, I've got to go to work!" Misato got up and shot into her room. Before Asuka even left the hallway, Misato was dressed and out of the door… then I realized something… it's Sunday! She doesn't have work today!  
"该死…听着，尽量别惹她生气…" 这话是什么意思？明日香从房间里走出来，穿着紧身牛仔裤和衬衫，"好了，我得去上班了！" 美里起身冲进她的房间。明日香还没走出走廊，美里已经换好衣服出门了…然后我意识到一件事…今天是星期天！她今天不用上班！

"Um… hi Asuka…" she walked over to my side and took my hand.  
"呃…嗨，明日香…" 她走到我身边，握住了我的手。

"Come on, we're going out for awhile," she dragged me to my room and led me inside, "Get dressed and meet me out in the living room. Try and move faster then a sloth," she walked back out of my room with hands on her hips. What was up with her? Not wanting to piss her off like Misato had said, I get dressed as quickly as I could and head out of my room. I wore a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt.  
"快点，我们要出去一会儿，"她拽着我到了我的房间，领我进去，"换好衣服，到客厅找我。尽量比树懒快点，"她双手叉腰，走出了我的房间。她这是怎么了？不想像美里说的那样惹她生气，我尽可能快地换好衣服，走出房间。我穿了一条牛仔裤和一件黑色 T 恤。

"Okay… um… what did you have in mind?" she grabbed my hand once again and dragged me out of the apartment.  
"好吧……呃……你有什么打算？"她再次抓住我的手，把我拉出了公寓。

"We're going to the lake. You're going to be training there today," damnit… I just had a feeling that it was going to be one of those days…  
"我们要去湖边。你今天要在那里训练，"该死……我就有种预感，今天会是那种日子……

"But… it's a Sunday… don't I get a day off?"  
"但…今天是星期天…我难道没有休息日吗？"

"NO! Now enough questions!" we walked the rest of the way in silence, and when we finally got to the lake she took in a deep breath, "Okay! First off, you're going to be swimming one mile." One mile?! "Now hurry up and get undressed, I don't have all day!" WHAT?!  
"不行！现在别再问问题了！"我们一路沉默地走到了湖边，她深吸了一口气，"好了！首先，你要游一英里。"一英里？！"快点脱衣服，我可没一整天时间！"什么？！"

"Wait a second… what? Why didn't you tell me to bring my swim trunks?"  
"等一下…什么？你为什么不早点告诉我带上泳裤？"

"Quit being such a baby! Swim in your jeans for all I care. You got ten seconds, and if you're not in that water by then…" she cracks her knuckles, "I'll put you in myself…" knowing that she wasn't joking around, I rip off my shirt and leap into the water…  
"别像个小孩子一样！你爱穿着牛仔裤游泳就游吧，我才不在乎。你有十秒钟时间，如果那时你还没下水……" 她掰了掰手指关节，"我就亲自把你扔进去……" 知道她不是在开玩笑，我迅速脱掉衬衫，跳进了水里……

"AH! It's cold! Can't we wait a few hours and let it warm up?!" it felt like I was in ice water!  
"啊！好冷！我们不能等几个小时让它暖和点吗？！" 感觉就像泡在冰水里一样！

"Get over it! Now, see that depth marker out there? I want you to swim there and back, and then you can get out… and GO!" I just stayed there floating hugging my body.  
"别抱怨了！现在，看到那边的深度标记了吗？我要你游到那里再游回来，然后你就可以上岸了……快去！" 我只是漂在那里，紧紧抱着自己。

"I… can't…" damn thermal expansion… okay, so it was more then just that…  
"我…动不了…"该死的温度膨胀…好吧，其实不止这个原因…

"I said go!" she picked up a medium sized rock and chucked it at me. With one last shiver, I take off swimming as fast as I could.  
"我说了走开！"她捡起一块中等大小的石头朝我扔来。最后颤抖了一下，我尽可能快地游走了。

"Cold… cold… cold… cold…" I reach the marker within a few minutes, and when I do, I see just how far out I was. I look up at the marker, '700 Feet'… "Damn it! I thought you said one mile! I bet that was one mile right there!" I doubt she heard me because she continued to stare at me with her hands on her hips. With a deep sigh, I begin to head back, swimming even faster then before, "Coldcoldcoldcoldcold!!!" when I finally reach land I throw my shirt back on and hug my body, "G-God d-damnit…" I look down at my jeans, "M-My p-pride…" I mutter under my breath.  
"冷…冷…冷…冷…"几分钟后我到达了标记处，当我到达时，我看到了自己游了多远。我抬头看向标记，'700 英尺'…"该死！我以为你说是一英里！我打赌那儿就是一英里！"我怀疑她听到了我的话，因为她继续双手叉腰盯着我。深叹一口气，我开始往回游，比之前更快，"冷冷冷冷冷！！！"当我终于回到岸上时，我迅速穿上衬衫并抱紧自己，"天…天杀的…"我低头看着我的牛仔裤，"我…我的自尊…"我低声咕哝着。

"Okay, hurry up and warm up. Once you're done, I have one more exercise for you." She was actually giving me a break? YES! I fall back onto the warm grass and smile. After a few minutes of basking in the heat, I thought that I might as well get this over with.  
"好了，快点热身。完成后，我还有一项练习给你。" 她居然给我休息时间？太好了！我顺势躺倒在温暖的草地上，微笑着。享受了几分钟的热度后，我想还是尽快完成这项练习吧。

"Okay, what did you have in mind?"  
"好的，你有什么想法？"

"Bout time," she got a wicked smile on, "Your last exercise… will be to land a punch on me…" sure that I misheard her, I take a step forward.  
"终于来了，" 她露出了狡黠的笑容，"你的最后一项练习……是要打中我……" 我确信自己听错了，向前迈了一步。

"Excuse me? Come again?"  
"你说什么？再说一遍？"

"You heard me. Just land a simple punch on me and you'll be done for the day," she had to be joking.  
"你听到了。只要简单地给我一拳，你今天就可以结束了，"她一定是在开玩笑。

"I'm not going to hit you! I don't hit girls, let alone my girlfriend!" she once again smiles, "No, I'm not budging on this one, I refuse to hit you!" she slowly walked over to me.  
"我不会打你的！我不打女生，更别说是我的女朋友了！"她再次微笑，"不，这一点我不会让步，我拒绝打你！"她慢慢向我走来。

"Fine then, just try and touch me. It doesn't have to be a punch, just lay a hand on me. Okay?" even though that DID sound better, I was still hesitant, "Go ahead, start when you want," this might actually be easy! With a shrug, I quickly thrust out my hand aiming for her upper arm. She simply side-stepped and let me stumble past her.  
"好吧，那就试试碰我。不一定要出拳，只要把手放在我身上就行。好吗？" 虽然这听起来确实更好，但我还是有些犹豫，"来吧，随时开始，"这可能真的不难！我耸了耸肩，迅速伸出一只手，瞄准她的上臂。她只是侧身一闪，让我踉跄地从她身边经过。

"H-How'd ya do that?!" how that hell was she so fast?  
"你怎么做到的？！" 她怎么这么快？

"That's none of your concern. Now try again, and the offer is still open to use fists!" like I was going to do that! "You'll be hell of a lot faster," didn't matter to me, I wasn't going to hurt her. I once again lunged for her, and she once again side-stepped, this time letting me fall to the ground, "Oh come on; I know you're faster then that!" I get up and run towards her, this time expecting her move. I make a sharp right turn and catch her off guard.  
"这不关你的事。现在再试一次，用拳头的机会依然有效！" 我才不会那么做呢！"你会快得多的，"对我来说无所谓，我并不想伤害她。我再次向她扑去，她又一次侧身避开，这次让我摔倒在地，"拜托，我知道你比那更快！" 我站起来，朝她跑去，这次预料到了她的动作。我猛地向右一转，让她措手不及。

"Got ya!" I yell right before I touch her.  
"抓到你了！" 我大喊一声，随即触碰到了她。

"Not quite," she ducked and slid away, once again making me fall, "Not bad, you're getting better by the second!" damnit… I get up and stand only a few feet from her.  
"还没呢，" 她一低头滑开了，又一次让我摔倒，"不错嘛，你越来越厉害了！" 该死……我爬起来，站在离她仅几步之遥的地方。

"Asuka! Look! Toji's behind you!" she turns and I lunge for her, this time catching her… damnit…  
"明日香！看！东治在你后面！" 她转过身，我趁机扑向她，这次终于抓住了她……该死……

"Um… see why I wanted you to use fists?" my hand rested neatly on her left breast. Out of shock, I couldn't move a muscle… and I was met with a hard slap, "Fine, you won, you can let go now."  
"呃…明白我为什么让你用拳头了吧？" 我的手恰好搭在她的左胸上。惊愕之下，我动弹不得…随即迎来了一记响亮的耳光，"好吧，你赢了，现在可以放手了。"

"Sorry…" my face was red both from blushing and the recent slap.  
"对不起…" 我的脸颊因羞愧和刚刚的耳光而涨得通红。

"Okay, we can go home now," I was still surprised at how fast she was. Where did she learn to move like that? We began to walk away from the lake… how I was able to walk I don't know. Not only was I still tired from swimming damn near two miles… but I had a lack of blood to my brain… guess why…  
"好了，我们现在可以回家了，" 我对她的速度之快仍感到惊讶。她是从哪儿学来那样敏捷的动作的？我们开始离开湖边…我也不知道自己是怎么走得动的。不仅是因为我刚游了近两英里而疲惫不堪…还因为大脑供血不足…猜猜为什么…

Misato's Crib

"Okay, you can do what you want now, you're done with training for…" we just stepped foot in the apartment and Asuka suddenly broke out in laughter. She falls backwards laughing extremely hard. I look over the room to see just what was so funny, and then I see it. A certain sofa was closed and surrounded by beer cans… and a small yellow tip could be seen at the top of the sofa. A small whimpering could be heard above Asuka's laughter. Casually, I walk over to the sofa and look down at the tip to see two eyes staring back up at me.  
"好了，你现在可以随心所欲了，训练已经结束了……" 我们刚踏进公寓，明日香突然爆发出大笑。她笑得前仰后合，几乎要倒下。我环顾房间，想看看是什么这么好笑，然后我发现了。某个沙发被关闭并围满了啤酒罐……沙发顶部露出一小撮黄色的羽毛。明日香的笑声中还夹杂着微弱的呜咽声。我随意地走过去，低头看向那撮羽毛，只见两只眼睛正回望着我。

"Got drunk again?" he slowly nods, "Misato found out that you stole her beers again?" he nods again, "And this is the result?" he nods and begins to cry. With a sigh I pull down the seat. He instantly leaps on me and hugs my neck sobbing into my shoulder, "She made you clean her room again?" he nods. This only made Asuka laugh all the harder. She had a sudden mood swing… wait…  
"又喝醉了？" 他缓缓点头，"美里发现你又偷了她的啤酒？" 他又点头，"这就是结果？" 他点头并开始哭泣。我叹了口气，拉下沙发。他立刻跳到我身上，搂着我的脖子，把头埋在我肩上抽泣，"她又让你打扫她的房间了？" 他点头。这让明日香笑得更厉害了。她的情绪突然转变……等等……

"Oh… God that's funny! I can't breath!" Asuka was starting to crawl to her feet, "Pen-Pen got his ass beat by Misato!" Pen-Pen continued to cry into my shoulder.  
"哦……天哪，太搞笑了！我快笑得喘不过气了！" 明日香开始挣扎着站起来，"Pen-Pen 被美里教训了一顿！" Pen-Pen 继续在我肩上哭泣。

"You want something to eat?" unlike Asuka, I was trying to comfort the beaten animal, "We have some tuna in the fridge," he slowly nods. Of course a penguin wouldn't pass up fish! While still carrying him I walk over to the fridge and pull out a small can of tuna. I set him down and pat him on the head, "Just give me a second," after I got done opening the can he swiped it from me and woofed it down, "Damn, you must have been hungry," with a small belch he tossed the can into the garbage and waddled over to his cooler.  
"你想吃点什么吗？" 与明日香不同，我试图安慰这只受伤的动物，"我们冰箱里有些金枪鱼，" 他缓缓点头。当然，企鹅是不会拒绝鱼的！我依然抱着他，走到冰箱前拿出一个小罐金枪鱼。我把他放下，拍了拍他的头，"稍等一下，" 我打开罐头后，他迅速抢过去狼吞虎咽地吃了起来，"天哪，你一定很饿，" 他打了个小嗝，把罐子扔进垃圾桶，然后摇摇摆摆地回到他的冷却器旁。

"If there is one thing Pen-Pen can do it's to piss off Misato." Asuka walks over to the sofa and carefully sits down, "Come to think of it, where is Misato?" she must have come back after we left, Pen-Pen didn't beat himself up!  
"如果说 Pen-Pen 有一件事能做，那就是惹恼美里。" 明日香走到沙发旁，小心翼翼地坐下，"话说回来，美里去哪儿了？" 她肯定是在我们离开后回来的，Pen-Pen 可不会自己把自己弄伤！

"I dunno… should I call her?" she waved me over and I sat next to her.  
"我不知道……我应该给她打电话吗？" 她挥手示意我过去，我便坐在了她旁边。

"Nah, she's a big girl, she can take care of herself." She grabbed the remote from my hands and turned it to some kind of jeopardy show.  
"不，她是个大姑娘了，能照顾好自己。" 她从我手中抢过遥控器，调到了某个问答节目。

"Um… what's this?" I may have said that, but I was yelling in my mind 'Give me back the damn remote!'  
"呃…这是什么？" 我嘴上可能这么说了，但心里却在咆哮：'把该死的遥控器还给我！'

"I don't know. Hikari told me about it awhile ago, and I just never had a chance to watch it. She said it's a cool game show," as the show started, I noticed that all of the players seemed to have the same traits. Coke-bottle glasses, button up shirt, acne galore, fat, and pocket protectors. I bet they all have gone to more then their fair share of anime conventions! The man that came on as the host was… odd, to say the least. He had extremely tan skin, yet a full head of grey hair. Hell, it wasn't even grey, it was platinum!  
"我不知道。光之前跟我提过，我一直没机会看。她说这是个很酷的游戏节目，" 随着节目开始，我注意到所有选手似乎都有相同的特征：厚重的眼镜、扣领衬衫、满脸痘痘、肥胖，还有口袋保护套。我敢打赌他们都参加过不止一次的动漫展！主持人出场时…至少可以说，他很奇怪。他皮肤晒得黝黑，却有一头灰白头发。见鬼，那头发甚至不是灰白的，而是铂金色的！

"Okay, first question; who is the pilot of Unit 02?" great, now we're showing up in game shows! One of the men instantly buzzed in.  
"好的，第一个问题；谁是 02 号机驾驶员？"太棒了，现在我们居然出现在游戏节目中！其中一个人立刻按下了抢答器。

"That's an easy one! It's the lovely," Asuka instantly smirked, "Rei Ayanami!" then she shot up with anger.  
"这个问题太简单了！是那位可爱的，"明日香立刻露出了得意的笑容，"绫波零！"然后她愤怒地站了起来。

"Blow it out your ass!" I couldn't help but let out a small laugh, "That's not funny! That doll doesn't pilot my Eva!" it was just her reaction to it all that made me laugh.  
"去你的！"我忍不住轻笑出声，"这一点都不好笑！那个玩偶可不会驾驶我的 Eva！"正是她对这一切的反应让我发笑。

"Oh, I'm so sorry, but it's Asuka L… uh… Laan-ge-ly… damnit… it's Asuka!" this just made her all the more pissed.  
"哦，真抱歉，但她是明日香·L……呃……拉安-格利……该死……是明日香！" 这让她更加恼火了。

"Langley Souryu dumbass! God, can't even get the name of your savior right!" she was turning red she was so angry!  
"是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你个笨蛋！天啊，连救命恩人的名字都记不住！" 她气得脸都红了！

"Okay, question two; when was the first penny pressed?" all of the contestants looked dumbfounded. After thirty seconds one of them buzzed in.  
"好的，第二个问题；第一枚硬币是什么时候铸造的？" 所有参赛者都一脸茫然。三十秒后，其中一人按下了抢答器。

"Um… what's a penny?" good question.  
"嗯…一便士是什么？" 好问题。

"Uh… huh… not to sure on that one… how about we just skip that one for now? Okay, here's a political question for you all. Let's see just how well you know your government; who is Gendo Ikari?" the same man that pissed off Asuka to begin with buzzed in.  
"呃…嗯…那个不太确定…要不我们先跳过这个问题？好吧，这里有个政治问题给你们所有人。看看你们对政府了解多少；谁是碇源堂？" 那个一开始惹恼了明日香的男人抢答道。

"He's the father of one of the pilots… I think Asuka?" she instantly put her shoe through the screen.  
"他是一位驾驶员的父亲…我想是明日香？" 她立刻把鞋子踢穿了屏幕。

"Did ya have to break the TV?" I helplessly click the 'On' button on the remote.  
"你非得把电视弄坏吗？" 我无奈地按下遥控器上的'开'按钮。

"I'm not the daughter of that asshole! He's not even German!" she continued to kick at the side of the TV, "I-KAR-I! Not Souryu! Ikari damnit!" what was with her mood… okay, moods today? One second she telling me to punch her, then she's laughing her ass off, now she's beating up a TV for something a guy on a game show said. I just let her take out her anger on the TV. Better it then me! After a couple of minutes she sits back down next to me.  
"我才不是那个混蛋的女儿！他甚至不是德国人！" 她继续踢着电视的侧面，"我-卡里！不是宗介！伊卡里该死！" 她今天怎么了…好吧，情绪多变？一会儿让我揍她，然后笑得前仰后合，现在却因为一个游戏节目上的家伙说的话而砸电视。我只好让她把怒气发泄在电视上。总比发泄在我身上好！几分钟后，她又坐回我旁边。

"So… did you get that out of your system?" she slaps the back of my head.  
"所以…你发泄完了吗？" 她拍了拍我的后脑勺。

"Don't be a smartass," WHAT WAS UP WITH HER TODAY?!  
"别耍小聪明了，"她今天到底怎么了？！

"Sorry… soooo… what now?" I hear Pen-Pen open his cool and 'run' as fast as he could over to the TV. He stood in front of it staring for a few seconds before screaming into the air, then collapsing to the floor in tears.  
"对不起……那……现在怎么办？"我听到企鹅潘-潘打开了他的冷却系统，并以他能达到的最快速度'跑'向电视机。他站在电视机前盯着看了几秒钟，然后对着空中尖叫，接着瘫倒在地上哭泣。

"I don't know! You tell me!" just wanting to get away from the yelling, I walk into the bathroom. When I was done, I took my sweet time washing my hands. Just as I was walking out a feel a drop of water hit my head. I look up to see Misato with her hands and feet pressed up against the walls, ending with her 'hovering' overhead.  
"我不知道！你告诉我！"只想逃离那尖叫声，我走进了浴室。洗完手后，我故意慢慢悠悠地洗手。正当我走出去时，感觉到一滴水打在我的头上。我抬头一看，只见美里双手双脚紧贴着墙壁，最后悬停在头顶上。

"Misato, what are you doing?" she carefully puts a finger on her lips telling me to be quiet, "Oh, okay, sorry. Oh, by the way, we're going to grab a couple beers, is that okay?" she instantly drops down on me and puts me in a headlock.  
"美里，你在干什么？" 她小心翼翼地用手指按在唇上示意我安静，"哦，好吧，抱歉。对了，我们要去拿几瓶啤酒，可以吗？" 她立刻扑倒我，把我夹在腋下。

"Like hell you will! You're still two years away from being allowed to do that!" wait… two years?  
"想得美！你还差两年才到法定年龄呢！" 等等…两年？

"Shinji, I thought Misato was gone!" she comes storming into the bathroom to see me and Misato on the floor, "EW! Misato get off of him! That's just gross! You're double his age!" did she seriously think that we were… ew… Misato leaped off me.  
"真嗣，我以为美里已经走了！" 她冲进浴室，看到我和美里躺在地上，"呃！美里，放开他！太恶心了！你比他大两倍！" 她真的以为我们在…呃…美里跳开了。

"Oh come on! I'm not some kind of pedophile!"  
"哦，得了吧！我又不是什么恋童癖！"

Misato's Crib

"I saw you two! Don't even try to lie to me!" Asuka storms off into her room.  
"我看到你们俩了！别想对我撒谎！" 明日香气冲冲地走进她的房间。

"What is up with her today?" Misato takes a long sigh after my comment.  
"她今天怎么了？" 在我评论后，美里长叹了一口气。

"Not today… tomorrow too… and the next day… and the next day… and possibly the next day…" she began to walk into the kitchen, "God I need a drink," I follow her and watch as she downs the beer.  
"今天不行…明天也不行…后天…大后天…可能还有下一天…" 她开始走向厨房，"天啊，我需要喝一杯，" 我跟着她，看着她一口气喝完啤酒。

"So… this will be going on for up to five days? Hold on…" I casually walk over to the sofa and grab a pillow. I bury may face in it and scream every curse I can possibly think of. When I was done I walked back into the kitchen.  
"所以…这将持续五天？等等…" 我随意地走向沙发，抓起一个枕头。我把脸埋进去，尖叫着骂出我能想到的所有脏话。结束后，我走回厨房。

"Does that actually work?"  
"那真的有用吗？"

"It helps me through the day… so one question, why is she like this?" Misato raises an eyebrow.  
"它帮我度过每一天……所以一个问题，她为什么这样？" 美里挑了挑眉。

"You seriously don't know?" I shake my head, "Really?" once again, I shake my head, "Okay, what happens once a month for girls?" damnit… okay, I know now.  
"你真的不知道？" 我摇摇头，"真的？" 我又摇了摇头，"好吧，女生每个月会发生什么？" 该死……好吧，我现在知道了。

"Guess I never really noticed. She used to always act like that around me, so I just didn't see the difference," with a sigh I walk into my room. After circling the twentieth of each month in red sharpie I lay on my bed.  
"我想我从未真正注意到。她过去总是那样对我，所以我没看出差别，" 我叹了口气走进房间。在每个月的二十号用红色记号笔圈出后，我躺在床上。

That Night – 12:00 AM  
那一夜 – 午夜 12 点

Misato and I were sitting at the kitchen table unable to sleep above Asuka's ranting.  
美里和我坐在厨房桌旁，无法入睡，因为明日香还在喋喋不休。

"How many times do I have to tell your feathery ass to stay out of my room?!" she was chasing a screaming Pen-Pen around the living room as me and Misato watched, "You're not getting out of it this time! Shinji help me out here! Why are you just sitting there? Help me with this damn bird!" she continued to chase Pen-Pen.  
“我得说多少遍你这毛茸茸的屁股才能别进我房间？！”她正追着尖叫的 Pen-Pen 在客厅里跑，我和美里在一旁看着，“这次你别想逃！真嗣，帮帮我！你坐在那儿干嘛？帮我抓住这该死的鸟！”她继续追赶着 Pen-Pen。

"How many more days?" Misato groaned.  
"还有多少天？" 美里呻吟道。

"Four…"

"How many hours?" "还有多少小时？"

"Ninety six…"

"How many minutes?"

"Five thousand, seven hundred and sixty…"  
"五千七百六十……"

"How many seconds?" "多少秒？"

"Three hundred forty-five thousand, five hundred and fifty… five hundred and forty-nine… five hundred and forty-eight…"  
"三十四万五千五百五……五百四十九……五百四十八……"

"Damnit…"

A/N- What? Read the title! The effects of puberty! That's an effect! Okay, I was just little over dramatic about it, but so what? It's funny to see Shinji in pain! Well, the next chapter will actually have something to do with the plot – and yes, this story does have a plot. I just haven't gotten to it yet. See what I mean I the next chapter; Join Me?, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
A/N- 什么？看标题！青春期的影响！这就是个影响！好吧，我可能有点过于戏剧化了，但那又怎样？看到真嗣受苦很有趣！好吧，下一个chapter章节会真正涉及剧情——是的，这个故事有剧情。我只是还没写到那里。下一章chapter见分晓；加入我？，在此之前，继续保持吧！

### Chapter 9 Join Me?  
Chapter 9 加入我？

A/N- Okay, screw the plot for now, I'm going for funny.  
作者笔记- 好吧，暂时抛开剧情，我要搞笑了。

Shinji's Room – Four Days Later - Morning  
真嗣的房间 – 四天后 - 早晨

"Please… for the love of God let this be over…" I rub my left arm, which after I made the wrong kind of dinner had a large purple bruise on it. I hear a knocking on my door, indicating that Asuka was awake. "C-Come in…" the door slowly creeks open to show her still in the long t-shirt that covered whatever else she was wearing, "Oh, hey Asuka…" with a smile, she walks over to my bed and takes a seat.  
"请…看在上帝的份上，让这一切结束吧…"我揉着左臂，自从我做了那顿错误的晚餐后，上面就留下了一大块紫色的淤青。我听到敲门声，表明明日香醒了。"进…进来吧…"门缓缓地吱呀一声打开，她依旧穿着那件长 T 恤，遮住了其他衣物，"哦，嘿，明日香…"她微笑着走过来，坐在我的床边。

"Listen, I want to apologize for the last few days… I've been going through… personal issues… sorry," YES!!!!  
"听着，我想为最近几天的事情道歉…我一直在经历…个人的问题…对不起，"太好了！！！

"Don't worry about it. I didn't even notice," like hell I didn't, "So, want me to make breakfast?" with a smile she leans down and pecks me on the lips, "What was that for?" I kinda liked it…  
"别担心。我甚至都没注意到，"鬼才信我没注意到，"那么，想让我做早餐吗？"她微笑着俯身亲了一下我的嘴唇，"那是为什么？"我有点喜欢这样…

"Just for being so sweet." Gotta try to do that more often! She gets up from my bed quite dramatically, leaning down and bringing her stomach to her thighs as she stood up… and giving a pretty nice view of what else she was wearing, "And that was for sticking with me," she mumbled as she left the room. I'm having one hell of a morning! Within that last thirty seconds, I've gotten a kiss AND the most I've ever seen in Asuka! Okay, so she had panties on, who cares? Feeling as if this might actually be a pretty good day, I head in for the shower. When I climb in, I notice that I'm the first one in here for the morning… I'm actually going to have hot water! I relax, but at the same time try and save enough hot water for at least Asuka. My heaven only lasts for five minutes, but hey, I'll take it. I climb out of the shower and get dressed. After glancing up and down the hallway I sneak into Asuka's room.  
"就因为你这么甜。" 得试着更常这么做！她从我的床上戏剧性地起身，弯腰将腹部贴近大腿，站起来时……还展示了一番她穿着的其他衣物，"这是为了你一直陪着我，"她喃喃自语着离开了房间。我今天早上真是精彩绝伦！就在这最后三十秒内，我得到了一个吻，还看到了迄今为止最多的明日香！好吧，她确实穿着内裤，谁在乎呢？感觉今天可能会是个相当不错的一天，我走向淋浴间。当我进去时，注意到我是早上第一个来这里的……我居然能用上热水！我放松下来，同时尽量节省热水，至少留给明日香一些。我的天堂只持续了五分钟，但嘿，我接受。我洗完澡，穿好衣服。在走廊上上下下看了一眼后，我悄悄溜进了明日香的房间。

"Hey Asuka, unless you want to take an ice shower, I recommend that you get in there now, I tried to save what little hot water this apartment has," with a smile she gets up off of her bed and goes into the bathroom.  
"嘿，明日香，除非你想洗个冷水澡，我建议你现在就进去，我尽量给这公寓里剩下的热水留了点，" 她笑着从床上起身，走进了浴室。

"Thanks Shinji… kun…" um… no comment… when she got in the shower I headed for the kitchen intending to make breakfast. Just as I was pulling out the pan, I hear the door bell ring. Praying to God that Misato didn't wake up, I go answer it.  
"谢谢你，真嗣…君…"呃…无话可说…她进浴室后，我走向厨房准备做早餐。正当我拿出平底锅时，门铃响了。祈祷着美里没被吵醒，我去开了门。

"Who the he-… oh…" when I open the door I see Gendo looking down on me.  
"谁啊-…哦…"当我打开门时，看到源堂低头看着我。

"Greetings. May I… speak with you?" morning's going down the drain!  
"你好。我能…和你谈谈吗？"早晨的美好时光就这样泡汤了！

"Sure, whatever," I step out into the cool air and close the door behind me, "Why are you even here so early? Couldn't this wait until after school?" I'm not sure, but I think I saw a small smile.  
"当然，随便吧，" 我踏入凉爽的空气中，随手关上门，"你这么早来这里干嘛？这事不能等到放学后吗？" 我不确定，但我好像看到了一丝微笑。

"Sorry, but it can't. I… need your help with something…" ah, so the mighty have finally fallen, huh?  
"抱歉，但不行。我……需要你帮忙……" 啊，看来强者终于也有求于人了，是吧？

"And what makes you think that I'll help you?"  
"那你凭什么认为我会帮你？"

"It will get you out of school for three days."  
"这能让你逃学三天。"

"What can I do for ya?" can't pass that up!  
"我能为你做点啥？" 这机会可不能错过！

"There is a game show Fuyutsuki and myself have won tickets to compete in. We have four, and we both thought that you and Miss Souryu most likely be the best competitor. The competition will last three days. Do you accept?" no, I was NOT looking forward to spending three days with my father, but hey, no school.  
"我和冬月赢得了一场游戏节目的参赛资格。我们有四张票，我们都认为你和惣流小姐是最合适的参赛者。比赛将持续三天。你愿意接受吗？" 不，我可没期待和老爸共度三天，但嘿，不用上学倒是不错。

"Sure, why not. What's the game's name?" Gendo, being the asshole he is, simply let himself inside.  
“当然，为什么不呢？游戏叫什么名字？” 碇源堂，一如既往地是个混蛋，径自走进了房间。

"I believe that it is named Takeshi's Castel. In America, it's more commonly known as _MXC_." He sat down on the sofa – he somehow knew to not just fall back onto it – and looked up at me, "I am… unsure of what the game IS, but I do know that it is a game show. Most likely will have simple question and answer rounds." I think I've heard of this show before.  
“我相信它叫做《武的城堡》。在美国，它更常被称为《MXC》。” 他坐到了沙发上——不知怎的，他知道不能直接向后倒下——然后抬头看着我，“我不太确定这个游戏是什么，但我知道它是一个游戏节目。很可能会有简单的问答环节。” 我想我以前听说过这个节目。

"Yeah, probably, but wasn't that show canceled back in 1991? Why is it back on the air?" he simply raised his glasses with his ring finger… his empty ring finger… oh! Burn!  
“是啊，可能吧，但那节目不是早在 1991 年就停播了吗？为什么又复播了？” 他只是用无名指推了推眼镜……他空空的无名指……哦！真讽刺！

"I am unsure. So, we leave in a couple of hours, are you coming?" damn!  
"我不确定。那么，我们几小时后出发，你来吗？"该死！

"Hold on! I need to pack!" just then, Asuka was walking out of the bathroom with nothing but a towel on.  
"等等！我需要打包！"就在这时，明日香只裹着一条毛巾从浴室走了出来。

"Oh, Shinnnjiii!" she sang, "I've got a-… WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING HERE?!?!" she jetted back into the bathroom blushing. Damnit Gendo! Look what could have happened to me if you hadn't shown up!  
"哦，真嗣君！"她唱道，"我有……他到底在这里干什么？！？！"她脸红着冲回了浴室。该死的源堂！看看你如果不出现会发生什么！

"Wow…" I heard him mutter. I slap him on the back of the head.  
"哇…" 我听到他喃喃自语。我一巴掌拍在他的后脑勺上。

"Keep your eyes to yourself." Once again, I think I saw him smile a little. Asuka comes storming back out of the bathroom – this time in her uniform – and slaps Gendo.  
"别老盯着看。" 我又一次觉得他似乎微微一笑。明日香怒气冲冲地从浴室里走出来——这次她穿着制服——并给了源堂一巴掌。

"How dare you look at me like that!?" oh yeah, that made sense. She was walking out of the bathroom singing my name, she must have wanted SOMEONE to see her.  
"你怎么敢那样看我！？" 哦，没错，这很合理。她一边唱着我的名字一边走出浴室，肯定是想让人看到她。

"Ah, Miss Souryu, I believe I have an offer for you," her head perked up a bit, "How would you like to miss three days of school?" then she seemed interested.  
“啊，酸流小姐，我想我有个提议给你，”她的头微微抬起，“你想不想错过三天的学校？”这时她似乎感兴趣了。

"Sure… what's in it for you…?" as always, that's our first question with him.  
“当然……你从中得到了什么……？”一如既往，这是我们对他提出的第一个问题。

"I simply wish for you and Shinji to accompany Major Fuyutsuki and myself to a game show. Shinji has already accepted his offer," of course he had to throw that in!  
“我只是希望你和真嗣能陪同福 Yuutsuki 少校和我一起参加一个游戏节目。真嗣已经接受了他的提议，”当然他得加上这一句！

"Hold on, so we'll be spending three days with YOU?" Gendo nods, "… but we also miss three days?" he once again nods, "Fine, but me and Shinji get out own room!" I hadn't even thought of that.  
"“等等，所以我们得跟你一起待上三天？”源堂点头，“……但我们也会错过三天？”他又点头，“好吧，但我和真嗣要单独一间房！”我之前都没考虑到这一点。”

"Naturally," he got up and headed for the door, "I'll be back here at nine to pick you kids up. Be sure to pack enough clothes," then he shut the door.  
"“当然，”他起身走向门口，“我九点会回来接你们。记得带上足够的衣物，”随后他关上了门。”

"NINE!?" we both yell in unison, thus waking up Misato. She comes lugging out of her room half angry, half asleep.  
"“九点！？”我们异口同声地大喊，结果吵醒了美里。她半怒半睡地拖着身子从房间里出来。”

"What's all the yelling about?" she goes into the fridge and grabs a beer.  
"吵什么呢？" 她走进冰箱，拿了一瓶啤酒。

"Um… we're going to some game show for a few days… we're leaving at nine," she instantly spit out what beer she had in her mouth. "Yeah, we know," Asuka and I say in unison, "I'm going to start packing," I walk back into my room and pull down the suitcase in my closet. I only pack the essentials, three pairs of pants, three shirts, three of everything. When I was done I glance at the clock. We still had two hours until we had to leave! I take my bag out into the living room and put it by the door. Seeing that Misato had already left for work and – from the sounds of it – Asuka was packing, I just turn on the TV.  
"呃…我们要去参加一个游戏节目，待几天…九点出发，" 她立刻吐出了嘴里的啤酒。"是啊，我们知道，" 明日香和我异口同声地说，"我去收拾行李，" 我走回房间，从衣橱里拉出行李箱。我只带了必需品，三条裤子，三件衬衫，三样每样都带了。收拾完后，我看了看钟。我们还有两个小时才出发！我把包拿到客厅，放在门口。看到美里已经去上班了，而且——从声音判断——明日香也在收拾行李，我就打开了电视。

"So, there's a show called Takeshi's Castel," a morning show had an announce talking about the game show we're going on, "Apparently, they were last cancelled because a guy had to have his balls remov-" then the screen went black.  
"所以，有个节目叫《武士城堡》，" 早间节目里有个主持人正在谈论我们要参加的游戏节目，"据说，他们上次被取消是因为一个家伙不得不切除他的蛋——" 然后屏幕就黑了。

"So, you all packed?" she wrapped her arms around me from behind the sofa while I was still facing forward.  
"那么，你们都打包好了吗？" 她从沙发后面抱住我，而我仍面朝前方。

"Yeah, you?" her hands wandered across my chest.  
"嗯，你呢？" 她的手在我胸前游走。

"Yep…" before I could react, she gripped my shirt and flung me over the sofa and slamming me on my back, "Now where the hell did you put it?!"  
"是的……" 在我还没反应过来之前，她抓住我的衬衫，把我从沙发上甩了过去，重重地摔在我背上，"你到底把它放哪儿了？！"

"Put… what…?" damn! She knocked the wind out of me!  
"放…什么…？"该死！她把我呛得够呛！

"You know damn well what I'm talking about! Now hand it over!" out of nowhere, a certain bird could be heard laughing, "uh…" she jets over to his cooler to see him with a bag of chips reading a pink book, "You son of a bitch!" Pen-Pen jumps out of his skin, slaps her and runs off to the bathroom, locking the door afterwards, "Asshole!" she picked up her diary and walked back over to me, "Sorry about that…" she was blushing slightly.  
"你他妈的知道我在说什么！现在把它交出来！"突然间，某只鸟的笑声传来，"呃…"她飞快地冲到他的冷藏箱旁，看到他正拿着一袋薯片读着一本粉红色的书，"你这个混蛋！"Pen-Pen 吓得跳了起来，给了她一巴掌，然后跑向浴室，锁上门后，"混账！"她捡起自己的日记本，走回我身边，"抱歉…"她的脸颊微微泛红。

"Don't… worry about it…" I was still trying to catch my breath. Looks like all good days have to come to an end… or not. Asuka lightly pecked me on the lips once more and smiled.  
"别…担心…"我还在努力喘气。看来所有美好的日子都得结束…或者未必。明日香轻轻地在我唇上啄了一下，微笑着。

"Is my Shinji feeling better?"  
"我的真嗣感觉好些了吗？"

"Um… yeah…" I knew that I had a deep blush on.  
"嗯…是的…" 我知道我的脸颊泛起了深深的潮红。

"Good, we can't have you hurt for our competition, now can we?" she wraps her arms around my neck, "By the way, what's this show called? I forgot to ask."  
"很好，我们可不能让你在比赛中受伤，对吧？" 她环抱住我的脖子，"顺便问一下，这个节目叫什么名字？我忘了问。"

"Takeshi's Castel, but it's called _MXC_ in America," she instantly goes wide eyed and walks into her room without a word. She comes back out a few minutes later holding a helmet and knee pads, "Um… Asuka? Why do you have those?" she waves a hand in the air.  
"武史的城堡，但在美国它被称为 MXC，"她立刻瞪大了眼睛，一言不发地走进房间。几分钟后，她拿着头盔和护膝走了出来，"嗯……明日香？你为什么有这些东西？"她挥了挥手。

"Forget about it. You might want to grab some too," she stuffed them in her bag and sat back down on the sofa. Thinking that I wouldn't need them, I sit down next to her.  
"别管了。你或许也想拿一些，"她把它们塞进包里，又坐回到沙发上。我以为自己不需要它们，便坐在她旁边。

"So, you excited about missing school?" she chuckles a little.  
"那么，你对逃学感到兴奋吗？"她轻声笑了起来。

"Yeah, I'm also looking forward to a good workout…" where was all this coming from? Not really wanting to know, I drop it.  
“是啊，我也期待着好好锻炼一番……”这些念头都是从哪儿冒出来的？不太想深究，我便抛开了它。

Misato's Crib – 9:00 AM

Just on cue, we hear a car horn outside play an upbeat tune. Me and Asuka grab our bags and walk out to Gendo's car… and suppress a scream…  
恰在此时，我们听到外面传来一阵轻快的汽车喇叭声。我和明日香拿起包，走向源堂的车……然后强忍住尖叫……

"Hey kids! Hop on in!" Fuyutsuki had a button up, short sleeved shirt on. He was the one driving. Gendo was in his normal uniform. We open the door and climb in the back, "Okay, you all ready?" he seemed really happy today.  
“嘿，孩子们！快上车吧！”冬月穿了一件短袖扣衫，是他负责开车。源堂则穿着他那身平常的制服。我们打开车门，爬进后座，“好了，大家都准备好了吗？”他今天看起来特别高兴。

"Um… yeah…" Asuka mumbled, obviously surprised at his attitude.  
"呃…是啊…" 明日香咕哝着，显然对他的态度感到惊讶。

"Good," he sped away from Misato's apartment.  
"好，" 他迅速离开了美里小姐的公寓。

"So… um… how long is this car ride going to be?" I didn't want to spend TOO long in here.  
"那么…呃…这段车程要多久？" 我不想在这里待太久。

"Huh? Oh, I'm guessing around four hours," … son of a bitch… Asuka lets her head fall onto my shoulder and whines, "Oh come on! It'll be fun!" fun as pissing off Asuka…  
"嗯？哦，我猜大概四个小时，"……该死的……明日香把头靠在我的肩膀上，抱怨道，"哎呀，来吧！会很有趣的！" 像惹恼明日香一样有趣……

"Can we at least put on some music then?" Asuka still had her head on my shoulder as she whined.  
"那我们至少可以放点音乐吧？" 明日香还把头靠在我的肩膀上，继续抱怨。

"Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. I got a CD that I think is pretty popular now…" great, Fuyutsuki trying to be cool… he puts the CD in and music starts to play.  
"哦，对不起，我忘了。我有一张现在挺流行的 CD……" 天哪，冬月试图装酷……他把 CD 放进去，音乐开始播放。

"It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme, that's right on time, it's tricky!" oh God…  
"说唱起来真棘手，说唱起来真棘手，说唱起来真棘手，准时准点真难搞，真棘手！" 哦天哪……

"TURN THAT CRAP OFF!" how was that even in Japanese?  
"把那破玩意儿关了！" 那东西怎么还用日语唱的？

"Oh come on, I like this song!" out of nowhere, Fuyutsuki begins to sing along with the words. Asuka silently cries into my shoulder as we listen to this fifty – possibly more – year old sing to a song from before we were born… ew…  
"哎呀，别这样，我喜欢这首歌！" 突然间，冬月开始跟着歌词唱了起来。明日香默默地靠在我肩上哭泣，我们听着这个五十岁——可能还不止——的老头唱着一首我们出生前就有的歌……呃……

"Fuyutsuki, I don't believe that they enjoy this song…" finally Gendo had a rational thought!  
"冬月，我不相信他们喜欢这首歌……" 终于，碇司令有了一个理性的想法！

"Fine," he pressed the eject button and pulled the CD out, "Then what – may I ask – do you have?" Gendo smiled and pulled out a pink CD that had the profile of the woman sign on the bathrooms.  
"好吧，" 他按下弹出按钮，取出 CD，"那么，请问你有什么呢？" 碇微笑着拿出一张粉色 CD，上面印着女厕所标志的图案。

"Yes I do… just keep rolllin' baby…" he put in the CD and a beat began to play.  
"是的，我确实有……继续滚动吧，宝贝……" 他把 CD 放入播放器，一段节奏开始响起。

"Alright, partner, just keep on rollin' baby… you know what time it is…" Asuka once again buried her face in my shoulder. "Gonna keep on rollin' baby! A-move in, now move out, hands up, now hands down, back up, back up, tell me what you gonna do now! Breath in, now breath out, hands up, now hands down, back up, back up, tell me what you gonna do now, just keep rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin," I saw that Gendo had a small smirk on as he sang along monotone.  
"好了，伙计，继续滚动吧，宝贝……你知道现在是什么时候……" 明日香又一次将脸埋在我的肩膀上。"要继续滚动，宝贝！前进，后退，手举起，手放下，后退，后退，告诉我你现在要做什么！吸气，呼气，手举起，手放下，后退，后退，告诉我你现在要做什么，继续滚动，滚动，滚动，滚动，" 我看到碇源堂嘴角微微上扬，用单调的声音跟着唱。

"Shinji… make it stop…"

"How about we just forget the music?"  
"我们干脆忘掉音乐怎么样？"

"Fine, we'll just ride there in silence then!" Fuyutsuki pulled out the CD and began to drive in silence. I hear Asuka let out a satisfying sigh. After a few minutes, Asuka decides to break the peacefulness.  
"好吧，那我们就安静地开车去吧！" 冬月拔出 CD，开始安静地驾驶。我听到明日香发出一声满意的叹息。几分钟后，明日香决定打破这份宁静。

"So… do you guys even know what kind of game show you signed up for? Do you even know what Takeshi's Castel is?" they both nod in unison.  
"那么…你们知道自己报名参加的是什么类型的游戏节目吗？你们知道什么是《城堡探险》吗？"他们两人齐齐点头。

"No, but how hard could it be?" she chuckles a little, "And what's so funny?"  
"不知道，但能有多难呢？"她轻声笑道，"有什么好笑的？"

"Nothing…"

Three Hours Later 三小时后

Simply out of boredom, Asuka has fallen asleep on my lap I was just about to fall asleep myself when my phone begins to vibrate. I take it out without waking Asuka and answer it.  
纯粹因为无聊，明日香已经在我腿上睡着了。我正要自己也进入梦乡，手机却开始震动。我小心翼翼地取出手机，没有吵醒明日香，然后接听了电话。

"Hello?" I'm whispering as softly as I could.  
“喂？”我尽可能轻声细语地回应。

"Shinji? Oh thank God," it sounded like Misato, "What game show were you going on again?" she sounded like she was in a panic for some reason.  
“真嗣？哦，谢天谢地，”听起来像是美里，“你又要去参加哪个游戏节目来着？”她似乎因为某种原因显得很慌张。

"Takeshi's Castel. Why?" I heard her gasp.  
"武的城堡。为什么？" 我听到她倒吸一口气。

"Shinji, you need to-… ge-… ru-…! Just ge-…" then the phone loses signal. Silently cursing the crappy phone service, I put it back in my pocket. Out of nowhere, Gendo begins to whisper back to me.  
"真嗣，你需要……挂……了……！就挂……" 然后电话失去了信号。我默默地咒骂着这糟糕的通讯服务，把手机放回口袋。突然间，源堂开始向我低声回话。

"Shinji, I've been meaning to talk with you," great. Probably another lecture about my sync scores, "How are things at home?" I'm sure that my eyes were at least three inches in diameter.  
"真嗣，我一直想和你谈谈，" 太好了。可能又是关于我的同步率分数的说教，"家里情况怎么样？" 我敢肯定我的眼睛至少瞪大了三英寸。

"Um… good… why?" he looked back at me, then at Asuka on my lap, then looked back at me with a raised eyebrow, "Oh… that… well, me and Asuka are kinda together…"  
"嗯…好…为什么？" 他回头看我，然后看向我腿上的明日香，又挑眉看回我，"哦…那个…嗯，我和明日香算是交往中…"

"I could tell from her after the shower this morning…" I could instantly feel my cheeks light up.  
"今早她洗完澡后我就看出来了…" 我立刻感觉到脸颊发烫。

"Yeah…" he should have seen us the night of our first date... "Was that all?" **he** shakes his head.  
"是啊…" 他本该在我们第一次约会的那晚就看到我们的… "就这些吗？" 他摇了摇头。

"No, I needed to know one thing, and please be honest… is the Major a decent guardian? I've heard… things…" her drinking, her obsessing, her teasing, and her relationship with Kaji… what' there to complain about?  
"“不，我只想知道一件事，请诚实回答……美里小姐是个称职的监护人吗？我听说……一些事……”她的酗酒，她的痴迷，她的挑逗，还有她和加持的关系……有什么可抱怨的呢？”

"Yeah, she's actually pretty good. She'd do anything for us," surprisingly, he actually smiles and leans back in his seat. After a few minutes Asuka begins to stir in her sleep. Almost out of instinct, I place my hand on her head. This actually calms her and she gets a small smile on.  
"“嗯，她其实挺不错的。她会为我们做任何事，”出乎意料，他竟然笑了，靠回椅背。几分钟后，明日香开始在睡梦中动弹。几乎是出于本能，我把手放在她头上。这让她平静下来，脸上露出了微笑。”

"Shin… ji…"

A/N- Okay, I don't own; Black Eyed Peas, Limp Bizkit, Run DMC, or any of their songs. Now that that's out of the way, back to business! If any of you don't know what MXC is, look it up, it plays on Spike TV. You won't get the next few chapters if you don't have any idea what it is. How will our heroes (?) survive this challenge? WILL they survive? Find out in the next chapter; Ride It, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
"作者注- 好吧，我不拥有黑眼豆豆、软饼干、Run DMC 或他们的任何歌曲版权。既然这些都说清楚了，我们继续正题！如果你们不知道 MXC 是什么，去查一下，它在 Spike TV 上播放。如果你不知道它是什么，接下来的几章你会看不懂。我们的英雄（？）将如何应对这一挑战？他们能生存下来吗？下一章《1001 次骑乘》中揭晓，在此之前，继续前行吧！”

### Chapter 10 Ride It

Car – One Hour Later  
车里 – 一小时后

Asuka was still asleep on my lap; Gendo had fallen asleep as well. Me and Fuyutsuki were the only ones awake in all of this… well… he kind of HAS to stay awake. I had to admit, Asuka was pretty cute when she slept. I got to see a side of her that is never shown… no emotion. Her face is blank and emotionless. This is never shown when she's awake… and there it goes. She started smile – once again – in her sleep.  
明日香依然在我腿上熟睡；碇司令也睡着了。我和冬月是唯一醒着的……嗯……他某种程度上必须保持清醒。我不得不承认，明日香睡觉时真的很可爱。我得以看到她平时不展现的一面……没有表情。她的脸庞空白，毫无情绪。这在她醒着时是看不到的……而现在，她又开始在梦中微笑了——又一次——在她的梦里。

"Shin… ji… mmmm…" she had a small smile on, just like I said – cute.  
“真……嗣……嗯……”她带着一丝微笑，正如我所说——很可爱。

"Have you said it yet?" Fuyutsuki began to whisper.  
"你说了吗？" 冬月开始低声问道。

"Said what?" he chuckled a little.  
"说什么？" 他轻声笑了一下。

"I mean have you said 'I love you' to her yet? Do you even feel that yet with her? I can tell you right now that SHE feels it," Asuka muttered my name again. You're not helping!  
"我是说，你对她说过'我爱你'吗？你对她有那种感觉吗？我可以明确告诉你，她有那种感觉，" 明日香又咕哝了一声我的名字。你这不是在帮忙！

"Um… n-no… I mean, yes, I do feel that… I think… but I haven't said it yet," how was I even supposed to know what love was? I have never been loved or have ever loved someone else.  
“呃…不…我是说，是的，我确实有那种感觉…我觉得…但我还没说出口，”我怎么可能知道什么是爱呢？我从未被爱过，也从未爱过别人。

"Okay, just curious… you need to think about that…" the car once again went silent until a few minutes later, "Okay everyone! Wake up! We're here!" he yelled through the car. Gendo slowly gets up, but Asuka pops up and props herself up with one hand… ouch…  
“好吧，只是好奇…你需要好好想想…”车子再次陷入沉默，直到几分钟后，“好了各位！醒醒！我们到了！”他对着车内大喊。源堂缓缓起身，但明日香突然弹起来，用一只手撑着…哎哟…

"What's going on?" she looked over at my quickly reddening face, "What's up with you?" she looked down at her hand and went red, only with a blush, not in pain like I was, "Ah! Sorry Shinji!" she whipped back her hand and sat up straight. I swear, by the time I'm actually going to be in the position to have sex, I'll be screwed. I'll be out in the battlefield firing blanks…  
“发生什么事了？”她迅速看向我越来越红的脸，“你怎么了？”她低头看着自己的手，脸也红了，只是因为害羞，不像我是因为疼痛，“啊！对不起，真嗣！”她迅速收回手，坐直了身子。我发誓，等我真的到了能做那事的时候，我肯定完蛋了。我会在战场上发射空包弹…

"Don't… worry… about it…" damnit that hurt!  
"别…担心…这事…" 该死，真疼！

"Okay kids, enough fooling around. We need to drop our stuff down at the hotel and go the show. We were in the parking lot of a run-down motel with only fifty rooms… great. We get out of the car and follow Fuyutsuki to the lobby to check in. Gendo stayed behind for some reason. When we got there Fuyutsuki, of course, got us rooms right next to each other. Now who didn't see that coming? We went up to our rooms, dropped off our bags and went back to the car to see that Gendo hasn't moved a muscle. We got into the car and Fuyutsuki sped off to Takeshi's Castle. "And here we go! Let's see if we can win some prizes!" Fuyutsuki seemed to be in a good mood…  
"好了，孩子们，别闹了。我们得把东西放到酒店，然后去看演出。我们停在了一个只有五十个房间的破旧汽车旅馆的停车场……真棒。我们下了车，跟着冬月去前台登记。源堂不知为何留在了车里。到了那里，冬月当然给我们安排了相邻的房间。谁会没想到呢？我们上楼放下行李，回到车旁，发现源堂一动不动。我们上了车，冬月加速前往《挑战者天堂》。"我们出发了！看看能不能赢些奖品！"冬月似乎心情不错……

"Hey Shinji," Asuka whispered in my ear, "how… long was I like that?" she sounded embarrassed.  
"嘿，真嗣，" 明日香在我耳边低语，"我那样…有多久了？" 她听起来很尴尬。

"The whole ride… you're pretty cute when you sleep, you know that?" she blushed and smiled slightly.  
"整个路程…你睡觉的时候挺可爱的，知道吗？" 她脸红了，微微一笑。

"Watching me sleep, huh? Pervert…" she playfully slapped my shoulder. I let out a small chuckle.  
"看我睡觉，嗯？变态…" 她开玩笑地拍了拍我的肩膀。我轻声笑了。

"Okay! We're here!" the car came to a screeching halt, "Everyone get out and get moving!" Asuka punches the seat.  
"好了！我们到了！" 车子猛地停下，"大家都下车，快点行动！" 明日香捶了一下座位。

"Crap… forgot my damn helmet…" we get out of the car and basically run towards the huge stadium. In a way, it looked like a coliseum. It had the bowl-shape to it. When we get inside we instantly see two men standing there waiting to greet us.  
“该死…忘了我的头盔…” 我们下了车，几乎是跑向那座巨大的体育场。从某种程度上看，它像是一座罗马斗兽场。它有着碗状的结构。当我们进入内部时，立刻看到两个男人站在那里，准备迎接我们。

"Why hello my friends! Are you ready to take on Takeshi's Castel?" the man speaking was dressed in an overly-extravagant kimono and he had his hair tied up tight in the back of his head.  
“哎呀，我的朋友们！你们准备好挑战武藏的城堡了吗？” 说话的男人身着一件极其华丽的和服，头发在后脑勺紧紧束起。

"Are you ready to get your sorry asses whopped by a giant shogun?"  
“你们准备好被一位巨型将军痛扁一顿了吗？”

"Are you ready to take on all of Takeshi's Castel challenges?" Asuka slaps her forehead as the other man in a red kimono spoke. We all kept quiet, aside from a heavily breathing Fuyutsuki, "Well?" Asuka shook her head while her palm was still grasping her forehead, "Come on! Are you?"  
"准备好接受猛的城堡挑战了吗？"明日香拍着额头，当穿着红色和服的另一位男子说话时。我们都保持沉默，除了呼吸沉重的冬月，"那么？"明日香摇着头，手掌依旧按在额头上，"快点！你到底是不是？"

"They won't shut up until you answer them…" Asuka mumbled in embarrassment.  
"你不回答他们就不会罢休……"明日香尴尬地低声嘀咕。

"Is that a yes or a no?"  
"那是同意还是不同意？"

"YES! Damn, will you just shut up!" Asuka yelled at the one in red.  
“太好了！该死，你就不能闭嘴吗！”明日香对着那个穿红色衣服的人吼道。

"Ohhh!!! Looks like we got a challenger with a temper here! Look's like Takeshi might have some trouble!" Asuka let out a long sigh.  
“哦！！！看来我们遇到了一个脾气火爆的挑战者！看起来武可能会有些麻烦！”明日香长叹了一口气。

"God damnit…"

A/N- Okay, in case you don't know about MXC (Takeshi's Castel), I'll brief you on it. If you already know what it is, just skip this. MXC, or also known as Most Extreme Elimination Challenge, is basically like Jackass, only stupider stunts. The goal of the 'game' is to fight your way through incredibly stupid challenges (like running across spinning barrels ten feet above water) to make it to Takeshi's Castel, where you then fight Takeshi himself. The risk of injury is incredibly high, in fact, at the end of every episode they do the Top Ten Most painful Moments of the episode. So yeah, that's the show. Now you get it. I still recommend looking some of the games up.  
作者注- 好吧，如果你不知道 MXC（武的城堡），我来简单介绍一下。如果你已经知道它是什么，可以直接跳过这部分。MXC，也被称为最极端淘汰挑战，基本上就像《蠢蛋搞怪秀》，只是更愚蠢的特技。这个‘游戏’的目标是通过极其愚蠢的挑战（比如在离水面十英尺高的旋转桶上奔跑）来闯关，最终到达武的城堡，在那里你将与武本人对战。受伤的风险非常高，事实上，在每一集的结尾，他们会展示该集的十大最痛苦时刻。所以，这就是这个节目。现在你明白了。我还是建议你去看看其中的一些游戏。

"Oh! She's got a mouth on her too!" the man in blue had a wide smile on, "Get that bleeper ready!" Asuka grabbed his collar.  
"哦！她说话也挺冲的！" 蓝衣男子笑容满面，"准备好那玩意儿！" 明日香抓住他的衣领。

"Okay, listen to me you sorry excuse for a man. I just got out of my cycle, and I'm still cranky as hell. So if you want to keep that sorry excuse for a noodle you call a head, I suggest that you shut the hell up!" damn I wish I had a shell to crawl into right now.  
"听着，你这可怜的男人。我刚从自行车上下来，还他妈的烦躁得很。所以如果你想保住你那可怜的脑袋，我建议你他妈的闭嘴！" 该死，我现在真希望有个壳能钻进去。

"Um… sorry miss… would this be a good time to start the challenge?" she let him go and walked back to my side.  
"呃…对不起，小姐…现在开始挑战合适吗？" 她放开他，走回我身边。

"Whatever…" the man smiled and whipped out a microphone from behind his back, "Damnit to hell…"  
"随便吧…" 那人微笑着从背后抽出一个麦克风，"该死的地狱…"

"TAKESHI'S CASTEL IS NOW UNDERWAY!" he blasted into the air. With a few seconds, we were surrounded by another team of all men, "I see that you're all here, so lets be-" Asuka cut in.  
"武的城堡现在开始！" 他对着空中大声宣布。几秒钟后，我们被另一队全是男人的团队包围了，"看来你们都到了，那么我们就开始——" 明日香插话道。

"Hold up! Where's everyone else? Isn't there supposed to be one hundred people here?" the man smiled awkwardly and scratched the back of his head.  
"等等！其他人呢？这里不是应该有一百个人吗？" 那人尴尬地笑了笑，挠了挠后脑勺。

"Well… we're just coming back from a canceling… and people didn't want to come…" the man in blue was blushing as he explained.  
"嗯…我们刚从一个被取消的活动回来…而且人们不想来…" 蓝衣男子解释时脸红了。

"Because they want to keep their dignity…" the man in red frowned slightly.  
"因为他们想保持尊严…" 红衣男子微微皱眉。

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 – 学校

"Hey everyone! Did ya hear what Shinji and Asuka are doing?" a student came rushing into the class that had just begun.  
“嘿大家！你们听说了吗？真嗣和明日香在干嘛？”一个学生冲进了刚刚开始的教室。

"Are they making out in front of the school or something? I'm not in the mood to watch…" of course Toji had to throw in his two-cents.  
“他们不会是在学校前面亲热吧？我可没心情看这个……”当然，东治得插上一句。

"NO! Their on Takeshi's Castel! Their competing right now!" the student drug the nearby TV to the front of the room and turned it on to show Asuka beating on the man in red.  
“不是！他们在武的城堡！现在正在比赛呢！”那学生把附近的电视拖到教室前面，打开电视，展示着明日香正在痛打那个穿红衣服的男人。

---

Takeshi's Castel

"What did you just say to me?!" she kicked him in the ribs.  
"你刚才对我说了什么？！" 她一脚踢在他的肋骨上。

"AH! I just said that you mature for your age! What did I do?" she kicked him again.  
"啊！我只是说你比实际年龄成熟！我做错了什么？" 她又踢了他一脚。

"And what the hell do you mean by 'mature', huh?! Were you checking me out? You pervert!" she kicked him again.  
"还有，你说的'成熟'是什么意思？！你在打量我吗？你这个变态！" 她再次踢了他一脚。

"Um… Asuka… I think he meant your personality… not your body…" not that she wasn't maturing fine physically of course! "We kinda need him to play… so don't kill him," she looked back at me and calmed down slightly.  
“呃…明日香…我想他说的是你的性格…不是你的身体…”当然，她的身体发育得很好！“我们还需要他上场…所以别杀了他，”她回头看了我一眼，稍微平静了一些。

"You got off easy!" She began to walk back to me, and then she turned around and began to run towards him, planting her foot in his groin when she reached him.  
“你算是走运了！”她开始向我走来，然后突然转身，朝他跑去，跑到他面前时一脚踢向他的下体。

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 – 学校

Not a boy or man in that room had a straight face. All were crying, cringing, holding their own boys in a mental image, or simply fainted. All of the girls cheered for Asuka for standing up to the man.  
房间里没有一个男孩或男人能保持表情不变。所有人都在哭泣、畏缩，脑海中抱着自己的男孩形象，或是直接昏倒了。所有的女孩都为明日香挺身而出而欢呼。

"Kick his ass!" a certain brown haired girl yelled through the room, making everyone stare at her with dropped jaws, "I mean… that… wasn't nice…" she blushed deeply.  
"踢他的屁股！"一个棕色头发的女孩在房间里大喊，让所有人都目瞪口呆地看着她，"我的意思是……那样……不太好……"她脸红得厉害。

"The class rep just cursed… this show rocks!"  
"班长刚刚骂人了……这节目太棒了！"

---

Takeshi's Castel

The entire male audience – including myself – let out a painful 'OOOO!!!' at the sight. She came back to me with a bright smile.  
整个男性观众——包括我在内——看到这一幕都痛苦地发出了'OOOO!!!'的叫声。她带着灿烂的笑容回到我身边。

"And just so ya know…" she put a finger on my chin and stared into my eyes, "You try anything like the stooge did and I'll make that look like it tickled…" now what was the point of that?  
“而且，只是让你知道……”她用手指托住我的下巴，凝视着我的眼睛，“你要是敢像那傻瓜一样乱来，我会让你觉得刚才那只是挠痒痒……”这到底有什么意义呢？

"Um… okay…"

"Damn… uh… let's get started now…"  
“该死……呃……我们现在开始吧……”

---

Ten Minutes Later

"Why do I have to do this?" I was up on a high ledge with a long pole in my hands, "Can't Fuyutsuki do it? I don't have much upper body strength!" I knew that that was a bold faced lie, but might as well try, right?  
“为什么我非得做这个？”我站在高高的岩架上，手里握着一根长杆，“不能让冬月来做吗？我的上半身力量可不大！”我知道这话说得有点厚脸皮，但试试总没错，对吧？

"And now we begin Poles Apart! The game is very simple, you stand twenty feet in the air with a pole in the middle of a lake and try to reach that tiny island over there!" the man in blue was telling me and some other contestant the 'rules'.  
“现在我们开始‘天壤之别’游戏！规则很简单，你站在湖中央二十英尺高的地方，手持一根杆子，努力到达对面那个小岛！”穿蓝衣服的男人正在向我和其他参赛者解释‘规则’。

"And what happens if I make it?" would I win something?  
“如果我成功了会怎么样？我能赢得什么吗？”

"BEGIN!!!" the guy next to me tried to use the pole to swing to the island, only to end up banging his head on a nearby wall, "Ahem… BEGIN!" I plan on using my teeth later on in life, so I took the easy way out. I simply put one end of the pole on the island, and one end on the platform, making a pole/hill, "What the hell is this kid doing?" then I just slide down it like a banister. Now that I was standing on the hill, I THINK I won this round.  
“开始！！！” 我旁边的那家伙试图用杆子荡到岛上，结果一头撞在了附近的墙上，“咳咳……开始！” 我打算以后用牙齿解决问题，所以这次选择了简单的方法。我只是把杆子的一端放在岛上，另一端放在平台上，形成了一个杆子斜坡，“这小子到底在搞什么鬼？” 然后我就顺着它滑了下去，就像滑扶手一样。现在我站在斜坡上，我想我赢了这一轮。

"Nice one Shinji!" Asuka waved to me.  
“干得漂亮，真嗣！” 明日香向我挥手。

"God damnit…" the man in red let out a long sigh, "Round two…"  
“该死的……” 红衣男子长叹一口气，“第二轮……”

---

Round Two

"I have to do WHAT?!" Asuka was up on the same platform as me, and on the same lake, only this time holding a rope.  
“我得做什麼？！” 明日香和我站在同一平台上，同樣的湖上，只是這次她握著一根繩子。

"It's simple! Just swing down to the island!" the blue guy was getting pissed, "Look, the other team's already done!"  
“很简单！只要盪到島上就行了！” 那個藍色傢伙越來越生氣，“看，另一隊已經完成了！”

"And he has a concussion!" he… let go of the rope too late… and slammed into a boulder that was supposed to be there for decoration. After a few moments of silence, she lets out a long sigh, "I swear to God… if I land in that water…" what she was wearing wasn't exactly swimming safe. She had a tight, light pink shirt on with short shorts… okay, so maybe it'd be okay with ME, but she'd be pissed.  
“而且他還有腦震盪！” 他……放開繩子太晚了……猛地撞上了一塊本應是裝飾用的巨石。沉默了片刻後，她長嘆一口氣，“我向上帝發誓……如果我掉進那水裡……” 她穿的衣服可不適合游泳。她穿著一件緊身淺粉色上衣和短褲……好吧，或許對我來說沒問題，但她肯定會很生氣。

"Just go!" she gave him the bird and went for the swing. She actually landed on the island with ease. I know I would've been in the water!  
"快走！" 她对他竖起中指，然后冲向秋千。她竟然轻松地落在了岛上。我知道我肯定会掉进水里！

"IN YOUR FACE!" she points at the man in blue, "That's right, the great Asuka Langley Souryu beat your sorry game! OH YEAH!" wasn't she getting just a little to confident?  
"在你脸上！" 她指着穿蓝衣服的男人，"没错，伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷打败了你那糟糕的游戏！哦耶！" 她是不是有点过于自信了？

"Hey! What's that?" the man pointed in the air and she looked up only to be met with a rubber ball being thrown at her, sending her flying into the lake, "That's what you get for mocking my course!" she breaks the surface red-faced with anger and embarrassment.  
"嘿！那是什么？" 男人指着空中，她抬头一看，却被一个橡胶球砸中，飞进了湖里，"这就是你嘲笑我的课程的下场！" 她满脸通红，既愤怒又尴尬地从水面冒出来。

---

Tokyo-3

"WOO!" every boy in the class howled.  
"哇哦！" 班上的每个男孩都嚎叫起来。

---

"You son of a bitch! You better hope I don't get to you!" she throws a stone at him then looks down, "Damnit!" she crosses her arms across her chest. Hey, at least she was wearing a bra. She eventually makes her way back over to us, "Gendo, you're up…" I saw Asuka still blushing. She let out a small shiver. Without saying a word, I take off my shirt and wrap it around her shoulders, taking care to cover her breasts.  
"你这个混蛋！你最好祈祷我不会找到你！" 她朝他扔了一块石头，然后低下头，"该死！" 她交叉双臂抱在胸前。嘿，至少她还穿着胸罩。她最终走回我们这边，"真嗣，轮到你了……" 我看到明日香还在脸红。她微微颤抖了一下。我一言不发，脱下衬衫披在她肩上，小心地遮住她的胸部。

"There," I lightly kiss her on the cheek. She was obviously surprised.  
"好了，" 我在她脸颊上轻轻一吻。她显然很惊讶。

"Thank… you…" "谢…谢…"

"Where the hell do we get these people? A smart ass boy and a red-headed bitch all on one team…"  
"我们到底是从哪儿找来这些人的？一个自作聪明的男孩和一个红发的泼妇居然在一个队里…"

"Um… your mic is still on…"  
"呃…你的麦克风还开着…"

---

One Hour Later

"And… we're back-" the man in blue was cut off.  
"而…我们回来了——" 蓝衣男子的话被打断了。

"From a God damn beating…" the man in red held an icepack to his head.  
"从一场该死的殴打中…" 红衣男子头上敷着冰袋。

"Um… yes… we're back with the last game of the day. The turnouts of this challenge will disqualify one team member from each team. The game is simple; just make your way across the lake using the row-boat provided…" we all nudged Gendo, "Please choose you players!"  
"嗯…是的…我们回到了今天的最后一场比赛。这次挑战的结果将使每队各有一名队员被淘汰。游戏很简单；只需使用提供的划艇穿过湖面…" 我们都推了推源堂，"请选择你的选手！"

"Why must I do it?"  
"为什么我必须做这件事？"

"I'm still wet."

"I already won one for us."  
"我已经为我们赢得了一场。"

"I… can't swim…" Fuyutsuki had an awkward smile on.  
"我…不会游泳…" 冬月露出了尴尬的微笑。

"Very well…" he let out a small sigh as he made his way over to the rowboat. With a loud 'BEGIN', he and the other man began to paddle. When they reached the halfway point, I heard Gendo speak, "This is… relaxing…" out of nowhere, the man in red yells.  
"很好……" 他轻叹一声，走向小船。随着一声响亮的'开始'，他和另一个人开始划桨。当他们划到中途时，我听到源渡突然说："这……很放松……" 突然，红衣男子大喊起来。

"Oh my God! What are those?!" suddenly, a large plastic boulder hit Gendo on the head, "Looks like a rockslide! Better hurry players!" Gendo looked up with his normal expressionless face.  
"哦，我的天！那是什么？！" 突然，一个大塑料巨石击中了源渡的头，"看起来像山崩！玩家们最好快点！" 源渡抬头，脸上依旧是那副无表情的模样。

"Ow…" he began to paddle extremely fast, leaving the other man to be hit by a good ten boulders. He eventually made it to the shore and got out of the boat only to be met with four…'gifted' women hanging on him.  
"哎哟……" 他开始极速划桨，留下另一个人被十几个巨石击中。最终，他到达岸边，下船时却被四个……'有才'的女人缠上了。

"Looks like we have a winner for today! Congratulations!" even with women hanging on him; he still kept his expressionless face.  
"看来今天我们有赢家了！恭喜恭喜！" 尽管身边美女环绕，他依旧保持着那副面无表情的脸。

"So… come here often?" he was instantly slapped and the girls stomped off, "I… apologize…" he made his way back to us, "What now? Do we go back to the motel?" we all shrug.  
"那么…常来这儿吗？" 他立刻被扇了一巴掌，女孩们气冲冲地走了，"我…道歉…" 他回到我们身边，"现在怎么办？我们回汽车旅馆吗？" 我们都耸了耸肩。

"No idea." Just then the man in red came up to us – still holding the icepack – and put a hand on my shoulder.  
"不知道。" 就在这时，那个穿红衣服的男人走到我们面前——手里还拿着冰袋——把手搭在我的肩膀上。

"Great job everyone! Come back here at the same time so we can start off round two! Get a good night's sleep!" he then ran off, not wanting to get hit again. We all shrugged and walked back to the car.  
"大家干得漂亮！记得按时回来，我们开始第二轮！好好睡一觉！" 他说完就跑开了，不想再被击中。我们都耸了耸肩，走回车里。

"So… was that fun? I really can't tell…" seriously, I really didn't know!  
"那么……那好玩吗？我真的说不准……" 说真的，我真不知道！

"Um… I had an okay time aside from my body being broadcasted across the nation…" she let a small shade of pink cross her cheeks, "Thanks again for the shirt by the way…" she mumbled just loud enough for me to hear.  
"嗯……除了我的身体在全国直播之外，我玩得还行……" 她的脸颊泛起一抹淡淡的粉红，"顺便再次感谢你的衬衫……" 她咕哝着，声音刚好让我听见。

"I personally enjoyed the end of it all…" Gendo raised his glasses, keeping his composure.  
"我个人很喜欢这一切的结局……" 碇源堂抬了抬眼镜，保持着镇定。

"I had a great time!" Fuyutsuki had a wide smile on.  
"我玩得很开心！" 冬月露出灿烂的笑容。

"YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!" we all – including Gendo – yell in unison. He gave a nervous laugh as he started the car.  
"你根本什么都没做！" 我们所有人——包括碇源堂——齐声喊道。他尴尬地笑了笑，随即发动了汽车。

"I'll do the first challenge tomorrow, I promise! No matter what it is, I'll do it, okay?" we all roll our eyes. He once again drove to our motel, neither Gendo nor himself making so much as a peep the whole way. Asuka laid her head on my shoulder and looked up at me with a smile.  
"我明天一定会完成第一个挑战，我保证！不管是什么，我都会去做，好吗？" 我们都翻了个白眼。他又一次开车送我们回汽车旅馆，一路上无论是源堂还是他自己都一言不发。明日香把头靠在我的肩膀上，抬头对我微笑。

"That was really sweet of you, Shinji…" she whispered so only I could hear it, "Who knew you could be such a romantic?" she lightly pecked me on the cheek. The rest of the ride was in silence, not a sound was made. I'm still not too sure why though. It could be from the fact that fifty percent of the people in this car got embarrassed on national television.  
"你真是太贴心了，真嗣……" 她低声细语，只有我能听见，"谁知道你还能这么浪漫呢？" 她轻轻在我脸颊上亲了一下。剩下的路程一片寂静，没有任何声音。我还是不太明白为什么。可能是因为车里百分之五十的人在全国电视上露了脸，感到尴尬吧。

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 – 学校

Unlike the rest of the nation watching this program, this class hadn't even seen Gendo compete.  
与全国其他观看这个节目的观众不同，这个班的学生甚至没见过源堂参赛。

"Man I love TiVo!" one of the boys once again pressed the 'rewind' button on the remote as all of the males watched, "Frame by frame… pause… rewind…" he repeated.  
"天啊，我真爱 TiVo！"其中一个男孩再次按下遥控器上的'倒带'按钮，所有男生都盯着屏幕，"逐帧播放…暂停…倒带…"他重复着。

"Come on already! They're not that great! I want to see the rest of this already!" one of the girls yelled, "Friggen hormonal driven boys…" she took her seat, accepting that she would not see the end of this episode until later on tonight when it re-ran.  
"快点吧！他们没那么厉害！我想看剩下的部分！"一个女孩喊道，"被荷尔蒙驱使的男生们…"她坐回座位，无奈地接受今晚重播前是看不到这一集的结局了。

"Hey, if you don't like it, show us something better!" Kensuke yelled, never taking his eyes off the screen. All of the girls rolled their eyes and began to talk among themselves.  
“嘿，如果你不喜欢，就给我们看点更好的！” Kensuke 喊道，眼睛始终不离屏幕。所有的女孩都翻了个白眼，开始互相交谈。

Motel – Asuka/Shinji's Room  
汽车旅馆 – 明日香/真嗣的房间

We were just walking into our room and about to get a moment of peace for the first time today. I fall back onto the bed and turn on the TV.  
我们刚走进房间，正准备今天第一次享受片刻安宁。我向后倒在床上，打开了电视。

"I'll be right back, I need to go change…" she grabbed a baggy shirt and went into the bathroom. My short time alone made me realize a few things; we were in here without adult supervision, she just grabbed a shirt… nothing else, my father just saw me with Asuka on my shoulder without a shirt on, and the fact that I just turned on Takeshi's Castel.  
"我马上回来，得去换件衣服……" 她抓起一件宽松的 T 恤，走进了浴室。我短暂的独处时光让我意识到几件事；我们在这里无人监管，她刚才只拿了件 T 恤……没别的，我父亲刚刚看到我和肩上的明日香没穿上衣，而我刚刚打开了武的城堡。

"And now we bring you the most painful moment of the day!" suddenly an image of Asuka getting pegged in the face with a rubber ball played over and over for the whole Japan population to see. After about the fourth time showing this, the man in red came back up, "And now let's see the aftermath!" then a still picture of Asuka looking down at her now see-through shirt blushing came up. I instantly turned off the TV, not wanting Asuka to see this. She comes back out holding all of her clothes in one hand. Just like this morning, she had the shirt on with only panties on underneath. She tossed her wet clothes into the sink and threw my shirt back to me.  
"现在我们为您带来今天最痛苦的时刻！" 突然，明日香被橡胶球击中脸部的画面一遍又一遍地播放，让整个日本的人都看到了。大约第四次播放后，红衣男子再次出现，"现在让我们看看后果！" 接着是一张明日香低头看着自己现在透明的衬衫脸红的静止画面。我立刻关掉了电视，不想让明日香看到这个。她拿着所有衣服走出来。就像今天早上一样，她只穿了衬衫和内裤。她把湿衣服扔进水槽，把我的衬衫扔回给我。

"Here's your shirt back. Thanks again," she sat down next to me and wrapped an arm around my shoulders, "So, do you know why I brought the helmet NOW? Those were some of the less abusive challenges, trust me on this one. I recommend that you bring yours tomorrow too," she knocked on my head as if it were a door, "I'd rather not have a brain dead boyfriend!" that sounded like a crappy soap opera…  
"这是你的衬衫，再次感谢，"她在我旁边坐下，用一只手臂环住我的肩膀，"那么，你知道为什么我现在才带上头盔吗？那些挑战还算温和的，相信我。我建议你明天也带上，"她敲了敲我的头，好像那是一扇门，"我可不想有个脑死亡的男朋友！"这话听起来像糟糕的肥皂剧……

"I'd rather not be brain dead at all, so I'll follow your wisdom my lady," I bow slightly and she chuckles.  
"我可不想脑死亡，所以我会听从你的智慧，女士，"我微微鞠躬，她轻声笑了起来。

"So what now, it's only one…" she got a smirk on… I see where this is going! "I have an idea…" she bit her bottom lip, "Let's make some prank calls!" a picture of me with a gun to my head appeared.  
"那现在怎么办，才一点……"她露出了狡黠的笑容……我明白这走向了！"我有个主意……"她咬了咬下唇，"我们来打些恶作剧电话吧！"我的脑海中浮现出自己用枪指着头的画面。

"Um… o-okay…" she let out a heavy laugh.  
"嗯…好-好吧…"她发出沉重的笑声。

"Oh come on Shinji! You thought I was serious?" she wraps her arms around my neck; "You really need to lighten up…" she leaned in and kissed me. That wasn't funny at all! Not wanting to start an argument, I melt into the kiss. We eventually feel back onto the bed kissing. This lasted for awhile until she finally broke it off and looked into my eyes, "But we really should try prank phone calling Gendo tonight…"  
"哦，拜托，真嗣！你以为我是认真的吗？"她用双臂环住我的脖子；"你真的需要放松一下…"她靠近并亲吻了我。这根本不好笑！不想引发争吵，我沉浸在这个吻中。我们最终倒回床上继续亲吻。这持续了一段时间，直到她终于停下来，凝视着我的眼睛，"不过我们今晚真的应该试试给源堂打恶作剧电话…"

---

10:00 PM

"For the last time, this is not I. C. Weiner!" Gendo slammed down the phone as we laughed our asses off. That was about the tenth time we've done that same joke, and it never got old!  
"最后一次声明，我不是 I. C. 维纳！"源堂砰地挂断电话，我们笑得前仰后合。这已经是第十次玩同样的笑话了，但从未觉得过时！

"Okay… I think I've had enough of torturing your father for one night… tomorrow same time?"  
"好吧……我想今晚已经玩够了折磨你父亲的把戏……明天同一时间？"

"You got it!" she let out another laugh. After a minute, she stretches her arms above her head.  
""就这么定了！"" 她又笑了起来。过了一会儿，她伸了个懒腰，双臂举过头顶。

"I'm getting tired; I'm going to bed…" I think we both realized that there was only one bed almost instantly as she said that. We sat there staring down at the comforter for a few minutes until I get up.  
""我有点累了，要去睡觉了……"" 我想我们俩几乎立刻就意识到房间里只有一张床，当她说出这话时。我们坐在那里，盯着被单看了几分钟，直到我站起身来。

"Don't worry about it, I'll sleep on the floor," I grab one of the two pillows and throw it on the floor. As I was taking one of the spare blankets out of the closet she spoke up.  
"别担心，我睡地板，"我抓起两个枕头中的一个扔到地上。当我从衣柜里拿出一条备用毯子时，她开口了。

"No, you don't need to do that! I'll do it, you already did enough for me today," she got up to take the sheet from me, but I throw it down next to the pillow.  
"不，你不用这么做！我来吧，你今天已经为我做了很多，"她起身想从我手中接过床单，但我把它扔到了枕头旁边。

"Like I'm going to let you sleep on the floor! Look, forget about it, I'm used to it. I've spent the night on the floor enough times at Toji's that it doesn't bother me. Just get some sleep, you need it," to my surprise, she actually sat back down on the bed.  
"我怎么可能让你睡地板呢！听着，别在意了，我习惯了。我在户次家地板上过夜的次数多到已经无所谓了。你快睡吧，你需要休息，"令我惊讶的是，她真的坐回了床上。

"Fine… but you get it tomorrow!" she pulled the sheets up and crawled under.  
"好吧……但你明天得还我！" 她拉起被子，钻了进去。

"We'll see," I lay down on my make-shift bed and try to get comfortable, "Sleep good Asuka."  
"走着瞧，" 我躺在我那临时的床上，试图让自己舒服些，"晚安，明日香。"

"You too…" she turned off the light.  
"你也是……" 她关掉了灯。

### Chapter 11 I'd Hit That!  
《1001 夜》 11 《我打那个！》

Asuka/Shinji's Room – 8:00 AM  
明日香/真嗣的房间 – 早上 8 点

I wake up to the sound of the shower running in the bathroom. I look up at Asuka's bed to see that she was woken up… no duh… who was in the shower, OJ? Jesus Ikari…  
我被浴室里淋浴的水声吵醒。抬头看向明日香的床，发现她也醒了……这不废话嘛……谁在洗澡，OJ？天啊，碇君……

"I am not a morning person…" I slug up to my feet and stretch my arms above my head only to have them be slammed against by the ceiling fan, "Damn!" I whip back my hand to see it beat red, "How the hell?" was this ceiling low or something? No… no it looked the same to me… how tall was I? I quickly brush it off as I turn on the TV waiting for Asuka to come back out. I found my mind soon wandering to what Fuyutsuki said. No, I haven't exactly said 'I love you'… do I even feel it? I think I do… but what do I even have it to compare it to? How do I even know what love is? From my definition of it, I really do believe that I love Asuka. Should I say those three words? Would it creep her out? Would it make her happy? What would it even be accomplishing? Even though I felt that it wouldn't accomplish anything, I felt compelled to do it. That same question kept popping up in my mind. Do you love her? And it was always met with a quick answer. Of course I do! If I didn't, then why did that question keep on appearing? I turn off the TV and lay back onto her bed. I inhale her scent and suddenly realize… if I didn't love her, then why do I feel like I'd be alone without her? She's the only person in my life right now that truly cares for me. Sure, I had Misato, but that was different, I saw her as a mother. That question was instantly replaced. Why haven't you told her? Once again, I had an answer, because I'm afraid. I was always afraid. I just don't want this to be ruined just because I want to tell her how I feel… but what if she feels the same way?  
"我不是个早起的人……" 我拖着沉重的步伐站起身，伸出手臂想要舒展，却被头顶的吊扇猛地撞上，"该死！" 我迅速抽回手，只见它已是一片通红，"怎么回事？" 难道是天花板变低了？不……不，看起来还是老样子……我到底有多高？我迅速甩开这个念头，打开电视等待明日香回来。我的思绪很快飘到了冬月说的那番话上。不，我确实没说过“我爱你”……我甚至有这种感觉吗？我想我有……但我有什么可以比较的呢？我怎么知道什么是爱？根据我的定义，我真的相信我爱明日香。我该说出那三个字吗？会不会吓到她？会不会让她开心？这又能达成什么？尽管我觉得这不会有什么实质效果，但我还是觉得非做不可。那个问题不断在我脑海中浮现。你爱她吗？而每次我都会迅速回答。当然爱！如果我不爱，那为什么这个问题会一再出现？我关掉电视，躺回她的床上。我深吸一口她的气息，突然意识到……如果我不爱她，那为什么我会觉得没有她我会感到孤独？ 她是我现在生活中唯一真正关心我的人。当然，我有过美里，但那不一样，我把她看作母亲。那个问题立刻被取代了。你为什么没告诉她？我又一次有了答案，因为我害怕。我一直都害怕。我只是不想因为我想告诉她我的感受而毁了这一切……但如果她也同样有感觉呢？

"I… love you… Asuka…" almost like I'm tasting it, I say it aloud. After a few minutes I hear Asuka. It felt right when I said it… in fact it felt great to admit it aloud, but the only person that really needed to know was oblivious to it.  
"我……爱……你……明日香……" 我几乎像是在品尝这句话一样，大声说了出来。几分钟后，我听到了明日香的声音。当我这么说的时候，感觉很对……事实上，大声承认这一点感觉很棒，但唯一真正需要知道的那个人却对此一无所知。

"Okay Shinji, you're up," I look over at the bathroom door to see her walking out in a towel. I get up and begin to walk over to the shower.  
"好了，真嗣，轮到你了，" 我朝浴室门看去，看到她裹着一条毛巾走出来。我起身，开始走向淋浴间。

"Thanks…" my voice must have had some kind of emotion in it, because she picked it up right away.  
"谢谢…" 我的声音里一定带着某种情绪，因为她立刻就察觉到了。

"Are you okay?" I just nod, "Did you need to tell me something?" now was the time… do it… I turn and look at her.  
"你还好吗？" 我只是点点头，"你有什么要告诉我的吗？" 现在是时候了… 去做吧… 我转身看着她。

"I… lo…" her eyes light up a bit, "No, nothing. Thanks for the shower," I walk into the bathroom without a word. Dumbass! That was the perfect time! She saw it coming, her eyes even lit up, and you still didn't do it! Mentally beating the shit out of myself, I walk into the shower. When I was done I get dressed and walk out of the bathroom to see her on her bed watching TV.  
"我… 喜…" 她的眼睛微微一亮，"不，没什么。谢谢你让我洗澡，" 我一言不发地走进浴室。笨蛋！那是最好的时机！她已经察觉到了，她的眼睛甚至亮了起来，而你还是没说出口！我一边在心里痛骂自己，一边走进淋浴间。洗完澡后，我穿好衣服走出浴室，看到她正躺在床上看着电视。

"You ready?" her voice was sharp. I think I just screwed up back there…  
"准备好了吗？" 她的声音很尖锐。我想我刚才在那边搞砸了……

"Um… yeah…"

"Well then come on, Gendo's getting pissed," without waiting for me she walks out of the room. I follow soon after her. I see Gendo and Fuyutsuki waiting in the car for us. We climb in without a word and Fuyutsuki takes off.  
"那就快点，源堂要发火了，" 她不等我回应就走出了房间。我紧随其后。我看到源堂和冬月在车里等我们。我们一言不发地上了车，冬月随即启动了车子。

"So how are we feeling today?" looks like Fuyutsuki's in a good mood.  
"今天感觉如何？" 看来冬月心情不错。

"Pretty good…" Gendo instantly responded.  
"相当不错……" 源堂立刻回应道。

"Um… okay…" there was my uneasy response.  
"嗯……好吧……" 我有些不安地回答。

"Whatever…" seriously, I think I pissed off Asuka. Well it was a little late to say anything now. So basically… I'm screwed. Nice one Shinji, you probably just ruined a relationship over not finishing your sentence. We ride the rest of the way in silence. I think Gendo and Fuyutsuki picked up on her anger. When we got there, we walked into the stadium in silence. We were once again met by the man in blue.  
"随便吧……" 说真的，我觉得我惹恼了明日香。现在说什么都晚了。基本上……我完蛋了。干得漂亮，真嗣，你大概就因为没说完一句话毁了一段关系。我们一路沉默地骑着。我想源堂和冬月也察觉到了她的怒气。到达后，我们沉默地走进体育场。那个蓝衣男子再次迎接了我们。

"And there they are! Are you all ready to begin Takeshi's Castel?" neither me nor Asuka were in the mood, but we didn't really have a choice.  
"看，他们来了！你们准备好开始武的城堡了吗？"我和明日香都没什么心情，但我们别无选择。

"Yes…" Gendo said after a few minutes of silence.  
"是的……" 碇在几分钟的沉默后说道。

"OKAY!!!" lights began to go off and within a few minutes the game began.  
"好嘞！！！" 灯光开始熄灭，几分钟后游戏开始了。

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 —— 学校

"It's on again!" at this point, even the teacher was watching the show. Kensuke rolled the TV to the front of the room and turned it on just as the opening credits began to roll.  
"又来了！" 这时，连老师都在看热闹。真希波把电视推到教室前面，正好在片头开始滚动时打开了它。

"Come oooonnnn Asuka's breasts…" a boy in the back row was praying. He was soon hit with a girl's shoe.  
"快点啊，明日香的胸部……" 后排的一个男生祈祷着。他很快就被一只女鞋砸中了。

"She's only fourteen you asshole!" she then begins to yell at the ceiling, "And who the hell is even writing this?! You're writing a mature story and you're fourteen! How is it that you have to be eighteen to read this and yet you can wri-"  
"她才十四岁，你这个混蛋！" 她随即对着天花板大喊，"还有，这到底是谁写的？！你写的是成人故事，而你才十四岁！怎么回事，十八岁才能读这个，但你却能写-"

---

Um… back at Takeshi's Castel…  
呃…回到武藏的城堡…

"Okay, our first event is about to start!" Fuyutsuki was standing in a cage and so was the other team member, "The rules are simple… don't get hit!" out of nowhere, a monkey was dropped into the cage. The monkey had a bat in its hands.  
"好了，我们的第一项活动即将开始！" 冬月站在笼子里，另一队的成员也在其中，"规则很简单…别被打中！" 突然，一只猴子被扔进了笼子。猴子手里拿着一根球棒。

"Oh mother of crap…" Fuyutsuki looked at the demented primate in shock before starting to run in circles around the cage as the monkey chased him. Soon, the other man was hit and down. The monkey was taken out of his cage, but Fuyutsuki was still being chased, "When is this over?!" the monkey took a swing, but Fuyutsuki jumped to dodge it.  
“哦，天哪……” 冬月看着那只疯狂的猴子，震惊之余开始绕着笼子跑圈，猴子紧追不舍。很快，另一个人被击中倒地。猴子被带出了笼子，但冬月仍在被追赶，“这什么时候结束啊？！”猴子挥出一击，但冬月跳起躲开了。

"Um… well… we really didn't think that deep into it… just keep running until you get hit…" Fuyutsuki let out an angry scream.  
“呃……这个……我们真的没想那么深……就继续跑直到被打中……” 冬月愤怒地尖叫起来。

"This is… amusing…" I heard Gendo mutter. I had to admit, this was pretty damn funny. Fuyutsuki was normally so in control and seeing him being chased by a monkey was flat out hilarious. But looking at Asuka made me forget everything that was going on. She had her arms crossed looking to the right, and away from me. She didn't seem like she was focusing on any in particular, but she did have a pissed off look on her face.  
“这真是……有趣……” 我听到源渡低声说。我不得不承认，这确实相当滑稽。冬月平时总是那么掌控一切，看到他被一只猴子追赶，简直太搞笑了。但看着明日香，我忘记了周围的一切。她双臂交叉，目光向右，避开我。她似乎并没有特别关注什么，但脸上明显带着愤怒的表情。

"Asuka?" slowly, I guide her any myself away from Gendo.  
"明日香？" 我缓缓地引导她，让自己远离源堂。

"What is it THIRD?" she put emphasis on the last word. Damn… that actually hurt to hear her call me that…  
"什么事，第三？" 她在最后一个词上加重了语气。该死……听到她这么叫我，真的有点受伤……

"Are… you mad at me?" she rolled her eyes.  
"你……是在生我的气吗？" 她翻了个白眼。

"No, not at all, now why would you think that?" she had a sarcastic voice as she damn near yelled at me.  
"不，一点也不，你为什么会这么想？" 她的声音带着讽刺，几乎是在对我大喊。

"Is it because of this morning?" she simply walked back to her original spot.  
"是因为今天早上吗？" 她简单地走回原来的位置。

"Just shut the hell up," I stayed where I was, not wanting to be TOO close to Asuka right now. After a few minutes, Fuyutsuki got hit square in the balls but the monkey, and the primate was pulled out of the cage.  
"闭嘴吧，" 我留在原地，不想离明日香太近。几分钟后，冬月被猴子正中下体，那只灵长类动物被从笼子里拉了出来。

"What was the point of that?" Fuyutsuki moaned.  
"那有什么意义呢？" 冬月抱怨道。

"To have a funny show my friend, to have a funny show!" the man in blue was laughing his ass off right now.  
"为了上演一出有趣的戏，我的朋友，为了上演一出有趣的戏！" 那个穿蓝衣服的男人现在笑得前仰后合。

"And another thing, you're still a virgin, so how do you know how people react to it? How are you even writing lime? You haven't even ki-"  
"还有，你还是个处男，你怎么知道人们对此的反应？你怎么写得出暧昧情节？你甚至还没..."

Takeshi's Castel (damn girl…)

"Okay, our next event is about to start! Please choose a contestant!" somehow, all of my team member's fingers raised to me.  
""好了，我们的下一个活动即将开始！请选择一位参赛者！"" 不知怎么的，我所有队友的手指都指向了我。

"But-" they continued to point at me, "I don't-" no one moved, "Fine…" with my head hung low, I walk over to the next challenge. When I get there, I see four doors that all look exactly the same. I was next to the other team's contestant.  
""但是——"" 他们继续指着我，""我不想——"" 没人动，""好吧……"" 我低着头，走向下一个挑战。到达那里时，我看到四扇门，看起来完全一样。我旁边是对方队伍的参赛者。

"Okay, here are the rules!" the man in blue was standing in front of us, "Choose a door and charge at it as fast as you can. There are four levels, and if you make it all the way, you win!"  
"好了，规则如下！" 蓝衣男子站在我们面前，"选一扇门，用最快的速度冲过去。这里有四个等级，如果你能全部通过，你就赢了！"

"So… we're basically running uphill?" he smiles at me.  
"所以……我们基本上是在爬坡？" 他朝我微笑。

"Kid, this game is called Wall Bangers, put two and two together. Three of the doors are made of plywood! Choose carefully!" he holds up a blow-horn and blasts it, "BEGIN!" we both stood there staring at him.  
"小子，这个游戏叫‘撞墙者’，把两和二加起来。其中三扇门是用胶合板做的！选好了！" 他举起扩音器，吹响了它，"开始！" 我们俩站在那里盯着他。

"But… won't that hurt if we chose the wrong one?" the man next to me had a nervous look on his face.  
"但…如果我们选错了，那不会受伤吗？" 我旁边的那个人脸上露出了紧张的神情。

"Well… yeah… but if you go fast enough you can just break through them… BEGIN!" we both shrugged. The man took off running full speed at one of the doors.  
"嗯…是的…但如果你跑得足够快，你可以直接冲破它们…开始！" 我们俩都耸了耸肩。那人全速向其中一扇门冲去。

"AAHHH!!!" he screamed as he ran, and was instantly cut off by plywood. He laid there unconscious, giving me ample time to find the right door.  
"啊啊啊！！！" 他边跑边尖叫，随即被胶合板截断。他躺在那里不省人事，给我足够的时间找到正确的门。

"Um… I said begin…" casually, I walk up to one of the doors and poke at it.  
“嗯……我说了开始……”我随意地走向其中一扇门，轻轻戳了戳它。

"Wood…" I go to the next one and poke it, "Wood…" I go to the last one and poke my finger through the paper, "There we go…" I tear it down and walk through, "Like I'm going to get knocked out when I can just poke a hole through it…"  
“木头的……”我走向下一扇门，又戳了戳，“木头的……”我走到最后一扇门前，手指穿透了纸面，“这就对了……”我撕下它，走了进去，“像我这样能轻易戳个洞的，怎么可能被打晕……”

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 – 学校

A certain girl in the classroom was bound and gagged because a certain fourteen-year-old wanted it to be like that… out of nowhere an anvil fell on her… then caught fire…  
教室里某个女孩被绑住并堵上了嘴，因为某个十四岁的少年希望如此……突然，一个铁砧从天而降砸在她身上……随后燃起了火……

"Man Shinji, you suck! Get hurt already! Stop using your damn brain!" Kensuke was yelling at the TV. A few girls are in the background personally liking the show.  
“真逊啊，真嗣，你快受伤吧！别再用你那该死的脑子了！”健介对着电视大喊。几个女孩在背景中亲自喜欢着这个节目。

"Is it just me…" one of the girls whispered with a smile, "Or is Ikari kinda cute now?" all of the girls nodded.  
“是我一个人这么觉得吗……”其中一个女孩微笑着低声说，“还是说，碇同学现在有点可爱呢？”所有女孩都点头表示同意。

"And did you see how sweet he was when he gave Souryu his shirt? Pretty hot too…" they all giggled, "I wouldn't mind having him by my side…" as all the girls were talking about Shinji, all of the boys were fuming at it.  
"你看到他给惣流那件衬衫时有多温柔了吗？还挺性感的……" 她们都咯咯笑起来，"我倒不介意他陪在我身边……" 当女孩们谈论着真嗣时，男孩们对此却怒火中烧。

"What makes Ikari so special, huh?" Toji was TRYING to show off.  
"碇有什么了不起的，嗯？" 冬二试图炫耀一番。

"He's not an overly obsessive, contradictive, controlling, jock who can't keep his hands off of girls long enough to see their real personality…" Kensuke was met with a hard punch to the arm.  
"他不是那种过度痴迷、矛盾重重、控制欲强、一见到女生就忍不住动手动脚的运动员，以至于看不清她们真正的个性……" 剑介话音未落，就被狠狠地打了一拳。

"Don't be a smartass…"  
"别耍小聪明……"

"Ouch…"

Takeshi's Castel

"You're such a wimp!" I walk back to the group to meet a yelling Asuka, "For once in your life, can you just take a risk!" calmly, I stand next to her.  
"你真是个胆小鬼！" 我走回人群中，迎面而来的是大声嚷嚷的明日香，"你就不能在人生中勇敢一次吗！" 我平静地站在她旁边。

"I did when I asked you out…"  
"我当初约你出去时就是冒险了……"

"Yeah, well I took a risk saying yes!" she shot back.  
“是啊，我冒险答应了！”她回击道。

"Um… I believe that it's your turn Miss Souryu…" bad time to cut in Gendo! With a 'humph', Asuka stormed off. She met the man in blue and looked up at him.  
“呃…我想轮到你了，绫波小姐…”真不是时候插话的源堂！绫波哼了一声，气冲冲地离开了。她遇到了那位蓝衣男子，抬头看着他。

"Okay, if you can't tell I'm not in the mood for jokes. Just tell me what I need to do and I can get out of here," her eyes were on fire as she spoke.  
“好吧，如果你看不出来我现在没心情开玩笑。直接告诉我需要做什么，我好离开这里，”她说话时眼中燃烧着怒火。

"Um… okay… this game is called Avalanche. You climb up a narrow passage up hill while boulders roll down onto you. If you make it all the way up, you win." With hands on her hips, she walks over to the hill, "BEGIN!" she began to claw her way up the steep hill as a boulder begin to roll down. She stood on her knees and as the boulder came to her, she easily punched it, making it fly over her head.  
“嗯……好吧……这个游戏叫做‘雪崩’。你要在一个狭窄的上坡通道中攀爬，同时躲避滚落的大石。如果你能一路爬到顶，你就赢了。”她双手叉腰，走向山坡，“开始！”她开始用爪子攀爬陡峭的山坡，一个大石块开始滚落。她跪在地上，当石块滚到她面前时，她轻松地一拳击出，让它从头顶飞过。

"Wow… there's some anger in that…" Fuyutsuki muttered. Looks like I indirectly won this challenge!  
“哇……这里面有些怒气啊……”冬月嘀咕道。看来我间接赢得了这场挑战！

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 – 学校

"Asuka's so hot when she's not mad at me…" a few of the boys muttered.  
“明日香不生气的时候真是火辣…”几个男生小声嘀咕道。

"Shinji's so hot without a shirt…" a few girls giggled.  
“真嗣不穿上衣的时候好帅…”几个女生窃笑。

Takeshi's Castel

Asuka had punched every single boulder that came to her over her head, and now she was at the top of the hill. The other man had to be taken away by paramedics because he broke a leg falling down. Without a word, Asuka made her way back over to us.  
明日香对着迎面而来的每一块石头都狠狠地挥拳，现在她已经站在了山顶。另一个人因为摔断腿被救护车带走了。明日香一言不发，径直朝我们走来。

"Very nice Asuka!" she kept her stare at the ground as she held the hand she punched with.  
“非常棒，明日香！”她保持着目光低垂，握着刚才出拳的那只手。

"Thanks…" her voice was monotone.  
“谢谢……”她的声音单调无起伏。

"And now ends the qualification rounds of Takeshi's Castel! Tomorrow, Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Souryu, Kozo Fuyutsuki, and Gendo Ikari will take on Takeshi himself! Sleep well you four, you're going to need it!" the man in red told us all over the intercom.  
“现在，武的城堡预选赛结束了！明天，碇真嗣、惣流·明日香·兰格雷、葛城美里和碇源堂将挑战武本人！好好休息吧，你们四个，明天可需要充足的精力！”红衣男子通过扩音器向我们所有人宣布。

"Well, to celebrate our victory, I propose that we all go out for lunch! How about that?" Gendo suddenly gets a new light in his eyes.  
"好吧，为了庆祝我们的胜利，我提议大家一起去吃午饭！怎么样？" 源堂的眼中突然闪现出新的光芒。

"I would… enjoy that… but we need to stop by the motel for a few minutes. I have to grab my wallet…"  
"我……很乐意……但我们得先回汽车旅馆几分钟。我得去拿我的钱包……"

"Naturally!" Gendo lost the light. We all walk back to the car, once again in silence. When we get in the sound of Fuyutsuki's stomach growling could be heard. Asuka was leaning up against the door staring out the window, still holding her hand by the way.  
"当然！" 源堂的光芒消失了。我们再次默默地走回车旁。上车后，可以听到冬月肚子咕噜咕噜的声音。明日香靠在车门上，望着窗外，顺便还一直握着手。

"Asuka?" I whisper over to her, "Are you okay?"  
"明日香？" 我轻声向她问道，"你还好吗？"

"I'm fine, Third. Back off," her voice was sharper then before. When we finally get to the motel, Asuka and I go into our room while Gendo and Fuyutsuki go into theirs. Asuka instantly goes into the bathroom when we walk into the room.  
"我没事，第三适任者。别管我，" 她的声音比之前更加尖锐。当我们终于到达汽车旅馆时，明日香和我进了我们的房间，而源堂和冬月则进了他们的。我们一进房间，明日香立刻就进了浴室。

"Damn it…" I heard her mumble inside the bathroom, "Dumbass Shinji got me worked up…" at this point, I had my ear to the door, "Come… on already… ah!" I heard a crack coming from inside the bathroom.  
"该死……" 我听到她在浴室里低声咒骂，"笨蛋真嗣让我心烦意乱……" 这时，我把耳朵贴在门上，"快点……来吧……啊！" 我听到浴室里传来一声破裂声。

"Asuka, Are you okay?" the door swings open, slamming my face in the process.  
"明日香，你还好吗？" 门猛地打开，正好撞到我的脸上。

"So what, now you're listening in on me? Asshole…" she sits down on the bed, "Tell Gendo to go without me. I'm staying here today…" she was still holding her hand.  
"所以呢，你现在是在偷听我吗？混蛋……" 她坐在床上，"告诉源堂不用等我了。我今天留在这里……" 她仍然握着手。

"But it'll be boring without you!" I was trying to cheer her up, "Come on, it'll be fun… free food!" she rolled her eyes.  
"但没你我会很无聊的！" 我试图让她振作起来，"来吧，会很有趣的……还有免费食物！" 她翻了个白眼。

"I don't care, just go, I don't even want to go out," with caution, I walk over and sit next to her, "Ever heard of personal space Third?" without a word, I grab her wrist and pull her hand from hiding, "What the hell are you doing? Let go of me!" the second knuckle on her thumb was out of place.  
"我不在乎，走吧，我甚至不想出去，"我小心翼翼地走过去坐在她旁边，"听说过个人空间吗，老三？"她一言不发，我抓住她的手腕，将她藏起的手拉了出来，"你到底在干什么？放开我！"她的拇指第二关节已经错位了。

"Why didn't you say anything to me?" she whips her hand back.  
"你为什么不告诉我？"她猛地抽回手。

"Because I can fix it myself, It's only dislocated!" it already sounded like she tried that back in the bathroom… and failed.  
"因为我自己能处理，只是脱臼而已！"听起来她刚才在浴室里已经试过自己复位……但失败了。

"Here, let me see it," gently, I grab her hand and look at her thumb. She didn't pull back when I did this, thankfully, "Does this hurt?" I lightly touch it with my free hand.  
"来，让我看看，" 我轻柔地握住她的手，查看她的拇指。幸运的是，她没有在我这样做时缩回手，"这样疼吗？" 我用空着的手轻轻触碰它。

"No… why?" I once again touch it.  
"不……为什么？" 我又一次触碰了它。

"How about that?" "那这样呢？"

"Still, no…" I continue to lightly touch it.  
"还是，不…" 我继续轻轻触碰它。

"You know, about this morning… I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that half-way; I didn't have the right to do that. If I wasn't ready to say it, I shouldn't have even begun to try." She looked at me with blank eyes, "I know that I got your hopes up, and then crushed them. I ruined your day, and I'm sorry… but I do want to say something…" a long pause, "I love you Asuka…" I yank her finger back into place, sending a loud pop through the room. She didn't make a sound; she just stared at me with a hanging jaw. I hug her tight, "I love you…" she hugged me back.  
"你知道，关于今天早上…我很抱歉。我不应该说一半就停下；我没有权利那样做。如果我还没准备好说出来，我甚至不应该尝试。" 她用空洞的眼神看着我，"我知道我让你燃起了希望，然后又将其粉碎。我毁了你的日子，我很抱歉…但我确实想说点什么…" 长时间的停顿，"我爱你，明日香…" 我把她的手指猛地拉回原位，房间里响起一声响亮的"啪"。她没有出声；只是张着嘴盯着我。我紧紧抱住她，"我也爱你…" 她回抱了我。

"I… love you to… Shinji…"  
"我…也爱你…真嗣…"

A/N- If that didn't make you go 'Awww!', then I have failed. So yeah, after seventy-three pages, they have finally said it. Those three simple words took this long… nice. Okay, so how do you think that their relationship be now? What will their final challenge be at Takeshi's Castel? Find out in the next chapter; Coming Back, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者注- 如果这没让你发出“啊~”的感叹，那我就失败了。没错，经过七十三页，他们终于说出了那三个字。这三个简单的词竟花了这么长时间……真不错。那么，你认为他们的关系现在会如何发展呢？他们在武藏堡的最终挑战会是什么？下一章《归来》中揭晓；在此之前，继续加油吧！

### Chapter 12: Coming Back

Asuka/Shinji's Room – Morning  
明日香/真嗣的房间 – 早晨

I wake up feeling Asuka's warm breath on my neck. Looking down at the bed, I notice something… out of the ordinary… we were in the same bed! Did we sleep together? I start to get up, but she swings her leg around me, causing me to stay still. Then I noticed something else… she was naked… and so was I… did we? Memories of last night come flooding back to me… we did! Did we actually have sex? From what I remember, yes… about three times actually. I remember what we both went through last night. All of the passion, all of our newly confessed love, everything came out. I took Asuka's virginity… and she took mine… we were bonded now. A simple 'I love you' turned into us having a passionate night together. I can't believe what's happening to me!  
我醒来时感觉到明日香温暖的呼吸拂过我的脖颈。低头看向床铺，我注意到一些……不寻常的事情……我们居然躺在同一张床上！我们是一起睡的吗？我试图起身，但她的一条腿绕住了我，让我动弹不得。接着我又注意到了另一件事……她一丝不挂……我也一样……我们难道？昨晚的记忆如潮水般涌回……我们确实做了！我们真的发生了关系吗？根据我的记忆，是的……实际上大约三次。我记得昨晚我们经历的一切。所有的激情，我们新近坦白的爱意，一切都爆发了出来。我夺走了明日香的童贞……她也夺走了我的……我们现在紧密相连了。一句简单的“我爱你”演变成了我们共度激情的一夜。我简直不敢相信这一切正在发生！

"Shinji…" I look at her to see her smiling at me, "Thank you…" she was thanking me? Hell, I should be worshiping her right now! "Last night was amazing… especially knowing that the person that I lost my virginity to… loves me… as much as I love him," she lightly kissed my lips.  
"真嗣…" 我看着她，她正对我微笑，"谢谢你…" 她在感谢我？见鬼，我现在应该是在崇拜她才对！"昨晚真是太美妙了…尤其是知道那个夺走我初夜的人…爱我…就像我爱他一样深，" 她轻轻地吻了我的唇。

"Same here…" I hug her tight, "I love you Asuka…"  
"我也是…" 我紧紧抱住她，"我爱你，明日香…"

"I love you too Shinji…" she began to whisper in my ear, "Want it again? Right now? We still have a few hours before we have to leave… do you want to make love to me again?" come to think of it… what if Gendo heard us? If memory serves correctly, Asuka isn't exactly quiet… ah, who cares?  
"我也爱你，真嗣…" 她开始在我耳边低语，"还想再来一次吗？现在？我们还有几个小时才需要离开…你想再和我做爱吗？" 想想看…万一源堂听到了怎么办？如果我没记错的话，明日香可不怎么安静…啊，管他呢？

"Do… you want to?" she nods and kisses me on the lips.  
"你…愿意吗？" 她点点头，吻上了我的唇。

"Yeah…" a few minutes later, we were doing just that…  
"嗯…" 几分钟后，我们便开始了…

Asuka/Shinji's Room – Morning  
明日香/真嗣的房间 – 早晨

"Ew! Shinji! Are you dreaming of me again? Pervert!" you… have got… to be KIDDING ME!!! Was that a friggen dream? Man, this sucks! I was slowly waking up from her yelling at me, but I leaped up when she threw a pillow at me, "Stop it!" okay, I was on the floor with all of my clothes on, so I know that it didn't really happen… but still… nice.  
“咦！真嗣！你又梦到我了？变态！”你……一定是在开玩笑吧！！！那是个该死的梦吗？天哪，这太糟糕了！我在她的吼叫声中慢慢醒来，但当她朝我扔枕头时，我猛地跳了起来，“住手！”好吧，我穿着所有的衣服躺在地板上，所以我知道那并没有真的发生……但还是……挺不错的。

"I can't help it! It's morning!" I try to cover up, "Sorry…"  
“我控制不住！天亮了！”我试图掩饰，“对不起……”

"Damn it Shinji, you'd think those dreams would stop! You already have me!" like that makes a difference! "Just hurry up and take a shower, we have to leave in about an hour," she was still in bed covered up to her neck, which she was taking great care to make them stay there… huh…  
“该死的真嗣，你以为那些梦会停止吗！你已经有我了！”就像那有什么区别似的！“快点去洗澡，我们大约一小时后就得出发，”她仍然躺在床上，盖到脖子，小心翼翼地确保它们保持在那里……嗯……

"Okay…" I stay on the floor.  
“好吧…”我继续坐在地板上。

"Well go already!" damn it…  
“快去啊！”该死的…

"I… can you wait like, three minutes?" her face reddens up.  
“我…你能等一下吗，就三分钟？”她的脸红了起来。

"Just go!" she begins to throw a pillow at me and I run into the bathroom. I take a shower as quickly as possible and get dressed. When I get back into the main room I see her still under the covers.  
"快走！" 她开始朝我扔枕头，我跑进浴室。我尽可能快地洗了个澡，然后穿好衣服。当我回到主房间时，看到她还在被子里。

"Okay, you're up," she drags herself out from under the covers.  
"好了，你起来了，" 她从被子里挣扎着出来。

"Damn… yesterday wiped me out. Every muscle in my body hurts… maybe a shower will help a little…" she slugs into the bathroom and turns on the shower. She only did one challenge yesterday! Sure, she dislocated her finger, but its fine now.  
"该死……昨天把我累坏了。我全身的肌肉都在疼……也许洗个澡会好一点……" 她拖着身子走进浴室，打开了淋浴。她昨天只做了一个挑战！当然，她手指脱臼了，但现在没事了。

"Do you just want to stay here today?" I yell through the door.  
"你今天就想待在这里吗？" 我隔着门大喊。

"Nah, I'm fine. We didn't come this far for me to stay in this crappy motel room!" yeah, but if she was hurt… "Oh, I almost forgot, today, don't forget to bring a cup or something. Last time I saw this show, a guy turn purple because he got hit there. Just a warning…" my heart sinks.  
"不，我没事。我们走了这么远，不是为了让我待在这个破旅馆房间里的！" 是啊，但如果她受伤了…… "哦，我差点忘了，今天别忘了带个杯子什么的。上次我看这个节目，有个家伙被打中那里，结果变紫了。只是个提醒……" 我的心沉了下去。

"But… I didn't bring one…" I wanna keep 'em!  
"但是……我没带杯子……" 我想留着它们！

"I guess you can just cover them up or something or just keep away from the shogun…" why did I have a bad feeling about that word?  
"我想你可以把它们遮起来或者什么的，或者干脆远离将军……"为什么我对那个词有种不好的预感？

"Um… okay…" now I didn't want to go! Damn it! Gotta make sure Gendo is the one that that happens to…  
"嗯……好吧……"现在我可不想去了！该死！得确保是源堂遭殃……

"Hey Shinji? Can you do me a favor?" she snapped me out of my mental image of Gendo getting kicked there…  
"嘿，真嗣？你能帮我个忙吗？"她打断了我在脑海中想象源堂被踢中的画面……

"Sure, what is it?" "当然，什么事？"

"I want you to tell me the truth here, and don't take this the wrong way… I thought about the whole Toji thing…" she took a long pause, "What do you think about sex?" did we really have to talk about this?  
"我想让你在这里说实话，别误会……我考虑了整个冬二的事情……" 她停顿了很久，"你对性有什么看法？" 我们真的必须谈论这个吗？"

"Um… as in…" "呃……你是说……"

"Us..." "我们..."

"Oh…" holy crap, holy crap, holy CRAP! What am I supposed to say here? "Well… I think that we might be too young…"  
"哦…" 天哪，天哪，天哪！我该说什么呢？"嗯… 我觉得我们可能还太年轻…"

"No, I mean do you think about it?" I'm a fourteen year old boy with a girlfriend like that… what does she think?  
"不，我是说你会想这件事吗？我是个十四岁的男孩，有个那样的女朋友… 她怎么想呢？

"Um… sometimes I guess…" my voice was barely above a whisper, "Why?"  
"嗯……有时候吧……" 我的声音几乎细不可闻，"为什么？"

"Because… I'm worried we're moving too fast with this, and I don't want something to happen that we'll regret…" the water turns off and I hear her step out, "Am I wrong?"  
"因为……我担心我们进展得太快了，我不想发生什么我们将来会后悔的事……" 水声停了，我听到她走出来，"我错了吗？"

"Well… there might be some truth to it, but I don't think that we're moving TOO fast, I mean, we've know each other for a little more then a year now…" even though we've been dating for a few weeks…  
"嗯……或许有点道理，但我觉得我们并不算太快，我是说，我们已经认识一年多了……" 尽管我们才交往了几周……"

"Yeah… I guess you're right… you said that we were too young…" she walks out of the bathroom fully dressed, "What would you say if I said that I wan-"  
"是啊……我想你说的对……你说我们太年轻了……" 她从浴室里走出来，已经穿好了衣服，"如果我说我想要……你会怎么说？"

"Are you kids ready to go? We've got a game show to win!" Fuyutsuki comes storming into our room. Why is it that somehow every man in this trip has managed to ruin a special moment for me?  
"你们准备好出发了吗？我们可是要去赢个游戏秀的！" 冬月突然闯进我们的房间。为什么这次旅行中每个男人都能毁掉我的特别时刻？

"Who the hell do you think you are barging in like that?! What if we were getting dressed?!" he crossed his arms and smiled… uh oh…  
"你以为你是谁，就这样闯进来？！万一我们在换衣服呢？！" 他交叉双臂，笑了……哦哦……

"And why would you two be dressing in front of each other? Aren't you too young for that?" oh damn it…  
"你们俩为什么要在对方面前换衣服？你们不是还太小吗？"哦，该死……

"W-We wouldn't be!" nice recovery Asuka… real nice, "Shut up!" even better! No, she didn't sound suspicious at all!  
"我们不会的！"恢复得不错啊，明日香……真的不错，"闭嘴！"更好了！不，她听起来一点也不可疑！

"Forget about it. Come on, let's go. I want to get there early," half an hour early? Asuka and I shrug and we follow him outside. Before I could react I feel someone grab me and pull me into another room. I see Fuyutsuki do the same thing with Asuka, pulling her into our room.  
"别提了。走吧，我们早点去，"提前半小时？我和明日香耸耸肩，跟着他走了出去。我还没反应过来，就感觉有人抓住我，把我拉进了另一个房间。我看到冬月也对明日香做了同样的事，把她拉进了我们的房间。

"What the fuck?!" I whip around to see Gendo looking down at me, "What the hell is Fuyutsuki doing?!"  
"搞什么鬼？！" 我猛地转身，看到源堂低头看着我，"副司令在搞什么鬼？！"

"We heard your conversation last night, and while I accept it, we need to talk."  
"我们昨晚听到了你们的对话，虽然我接受了，但我们得谈谈。"

"You could have just asked us… is Asuka getting the same thing or something?" I think I saw him smile a little.  
"你本可以直接问我们的……明日香也会得到同样的东西吗？" 我想我看到他微微一笑。"

"Fuyutsuki is talking to Asuka…" he guides me over to a chair and sits me down, "Listen, I realize what is going on in your body," ah crap, this again? I've already heard this like, five times from Misato! "And I wanted to ask you something…" okay, that might be new; "Did you two have… intercourse yet?" was he actually acting like a father?  
"冬月正在和明日香谈话……" 他引导我到一张椅子旁，让我坐下，"听着，我明白你身体里发生了什么，" 啊，糟糕，这话题又来了？我已经从美里那里听过五遍了！"我想问你一件事……" 好吧，这可能是新的；"你们俩……已经发生过关系了吗？" 他真的像一个父亲那样在问吗？

"NO!" I hear Asuka yell the same thing next door.  
"没有！" 我听到隔壁的明日香也喊出了同样的话。

"Are you sure?" he raised an eyebrow.  
"你确定吗？" 他挑了挑眉毛。

"No father, I'm not sure if I'm a virgin or not. Yes I'm sure! I mean, we've ki-… wait… why am I telling you this?"  
"爸爸，我不确定自己是不是处女。是的，我确定！我是说，我们有过……等等……我为什么要告诉你这个？"

"If what you say is true… then we must have this talk," ugh…  
"如果你说的是真的……那我们必须谈谈，"呃……"

"Get it over with… but just so you know, I already know all of this…" I probably know more then that old bastard does! He then pulled out – from behind his back – two objects, "EW! I'm outta here!" I run out of the room to meet Asuka panting just as much as I was.  
"快点说完吧……不过你知道吗，这些我早就知道了……"我可能比那个老家伙懂得还多！他从背后拿出两个东西，"哎呀！我走了！"我跑出房间，正好遇到气喘吁吁的明日香。

"Did he… use the-" "他是不是…用了那个-"

"Yeah…" "嗯…"

"I'm never going to eat another hot dog again…" her eyes were the size of dinner plates, as were mine.  
"我再也不想吃热狗了…" 她的眼睛瞪得像餐盘一样大，我的也是。

"Or doughnuts…" "还有甜甜圈…"

Takeshi's Castel 武的城堡

"And now we begin the final round of Takeshi's Castel! Will our contestants survive? Will they leave with all body parts? Will they ever walk again?" no, that wasn't stressful!  
"现在我们开始武的城堡的最后一轮！我们的选手能幸存吗？他们会带着所有身体部位离开吗？他们还能走路吗？"不，这还不够紧张！"

"Maybe, but we know one thing for sure… they ain't leaving with their dignity! That was lost a long time ago for each of them! Fuyutsuki was hit in the balls by a monkey, Gendo was slapped by a beautiful woman, Shinji showed that he was a raging nerd, and Asuka flashed the entire Japanese population!" a stone hit the bullet-proof glass and bounced off.  
"也许吧，但我们确切知道一件事……他们不会带着尊严离开！这对他们每个人来说早已失去很久了！冬月被猴子击中了下体，碇被一位美女扇了耳光，真嗣展示了他是个狂热的书呆子，而明日香则向整个日本人口展示了她的风采！"一块石头击中了防弹玻璃并弹开了。

"I swear to God, if I see you after this damn thing is over, you're dead!"  
"我发誓，如果这该死的事情结束后我还能见到你，你就死定了！"

"Guess what little girlie? You can't do anything!" the man in red yelled.  
"猜猜看，小姑娘？你什么也做不了！" 红衣男子喊道。"

"Dude…" the man in blue tried to get his attention, but failed.  
"伙计…" 蓝衣男子试图引起他的注意，但失败了。"

"You're just a slimy little demon with a heart of ice! But its okay, you know why? Because it doesn't matter anymore! All you're going to be known as is the red-headed bitch with a small rack!" Asuka was turning red with anger as she stared at him… why don't I see a peaceful solution to this?  
"你不过是个心肠冰冷的狡猾小恶魔！不过没关系，你知道为什么吗？因为这已经不重要了！你只会被记住为一个红发、胸小的泼妇！" 明日香气得满脸通红，瞪着他……为什么我看不到和平解决的办法呢？

"Dude… you do know that you play the role of Takeshi… right?" the man fell backwards and Asuka smiled, "Ugh… file for a new co-host… okay contestants, this is an obstacle course. First, make your way across three yards of burning coal, then run across four turning barrels above water, then make your way up the hill of death, full of boulders, wrecking balls, shoguns with bats and – to add a little drama to the kids… forty clones of MJ!" I heard Gendo chuckle a little, "Once you make it up there, Asuka is free to beat on Takeshi all she wants!"  
"老兄……你知道你扮演的是武的角色吧？" 那人向后倒去，明日香笑了笑，"呃……申请个新搭档……好了，参赛者们，这是一场障碍赛。首先，穿过三码长的燃烧煤炭，然后跑过水面上的四个旋转桶，接着爬上满是巨石、破坏球、挥棒的武士和——为了给孩子们增加点戏剧性——四十个 MJ 的克隆体组成的死亡之山！" 我听到源堂轻笑了一声，"一旦你爬上去，明日香就可以随心所欲地揍武了！"

"Don't say that! I like my organs where they are, thank you!" this guy was so screwed!  
"别这么说！我喜欢我的器官待在原位，谢谢！" 这家伙真是完蛋了！

"Come on Shinji!" Asuka grabbed my wrist and drug me across the coals, "Dumb asses forgot to make us take off our shoes…" why weren't Gendo and Fuyutsuki coming? They were just standing back watching us! After we got past the coals, we stopped in front of the barrels, "Any ideas?"  
"快点，真嗣！" 明日香抓住我的手腕，拖着我穿过炭火，"那些蠢货忘了让我们脱鞋……" 为什么源堂和冬月不来？他们就站在后面看着我们！穿过炭火后，我们停在桶前，"有什么主意吗？"

"Actually, yeah. Give me your shoe," she raised an eyebrow and took off her left shoe.  
"其实，有。把你的鞋给我，" 她扬起眉毛，脱下左脚的鞋。

"What are you…?" I stick the shoe in the turning gear, making one of the barrels stop turning, "AH! You just thrashed my shoe!"  
"你要干什么……？" 我把鞋塞进旋转的齿轮里，让其中一个桶停止转动，"啊！你把我的鞋弄坏了！"

"Sorry… I thought that you wanted to get back at Takeshi…" she smiled.  
"对不起……我以为你想报复武……" 她微笑着说。

"Okay, no problem… but you have to take me shopping now!" I jump onto the barrel and hold out my hand to help her up, "Why thank you…" when she was up there, she takes off her other shoe and hands it to me, "Might as well use this one to stop that barrel, it's kinda missing it's right side…" ignoring her corny joke, I stick it in the next gear, making the barrel stop in the process.  
"好吧，没问题……但你得带我去购物了！" 我跳上桶，伸出手帮她上来，"为什么不呢……" 她上来后，脱下另一只鞋递给我，"干脆用这只鞋来堵住那个桶吧，它右边有点缺损……" 我无视她的冷笑话，把鞋塞进下一个齿轮，让桶停了下来。

"Okay, one more…" I help her onto the next barrel. Instead of taking off my shoe to stop it, I simply take off my shirt to stop the gear.  
"再来一个……" 我帮她上了下一个桶。这次我没有脱鞋来停住它，而是直接脱掉了衬衫来阻止齿轮转动。

"No fair! All you're losing is a cheap shirt! Those were brand-name shoes!" why was she even wearing those here?  
“不公平！你只是丢了一件便宜衬衫！那些可是名牌鞋！”她为什么在这里穿那些？

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 – 学校

"That guy is gonna get his nuts twisted off! This show rocks!" all of the boys gathered around the TV hoping for something violent to happen, "Man, I can't wait until they make it! Go Shinji!" all of the girls in the back stared at the glowing screen.  
“那家伙的蛋蛋要被拧掉了！这节目太棒了！”所有男孩都围在电视机前，期待着发生点暴力场面，“伙计，我等不及他们动手了！冲啊，真嗣！”后排的女生们盯着发光的屏幕。

"Yeah… go Shinji…" a certain girl had a deep blush on as she stared at the TV.  
“是啊……冲啊，真嗣……”某个女孩脸颊泛红，盯着电视。

"Pilot Ikari is… muscular…" the blush only grew deeper as she spoke those words. Her hair only made her pale skin look all the redder…  
"碇真嗣少尉真是…肌肉发达呢…" 她越说脸越红。她的头发让她的苍白肌肤显得更加红润…

Takeshi's Castel 武藏的城堡

"Well, I didn't have to use your shoe… I could have used your shirt…" I smirk as she blushes.  
"好吧，我本可以用你的衬衫的…而不是你的鞋子…" 我坏笑着看她脸红。

"Never mind…" I help her onto the next barrel and help her jump onto the foot of the hill, "Okay, now for the hill…" she dodged a boulder and let it fall into the water behind her, "Any real ideas for this one?" we watched a giant shogun with a bat scurry across the hill, just waiting for us.  
“没关系…” 我扶她上了下一个桶，帮她跳上小山坡的脚下，“好了，现在轮到山坡了…” 她躲开一块巨石，让它落入身后的水中，“有什么实际的办法吗？” 我们看着一个拿着棍子的大将军匆匆穿过山坡，似乎在等着我们。

"Once again, yes. You see how that Shogun knows where and when to dodge the boulders? Well, all we have to do is follow his patterns, and we'll be able to make it up."  
“再次强调，是的。你看那个将军是如何知道何时何地躲避巨石的？我们只需要模仿他的行动模式，就能顺利上山。”

"Well that's all fine and dandy until we actually reach the shogun… then what?" I had a little something planned…  
“那听起来不错，直到我们真的遇到将军… 之后怎么办？” 我有个小计划…

"Just leave that up to me, for now, let's just get up to him," we begin to climb up the steep hill, following the giant shogun's movements all the way. When we make it about three yards away from him, I hold my hand out, "Okay, wait here. Don't move from this spot, okay?" she slowly nods, trying to hold onto the loose dirt. I take off my shoe and set it up at a forty-five degree angle pointing to the sky about three feet in front of her, "Okay, now duck and hold you head. Don't make a move, okay?"  
"这事交给我吧，现在我们先爬上去接近他，"我们开始攀登陡峭的山坡，一路紧随那位巨型将军的动向。当我们离他大约三码远时，我伸出手，"好了，在这里等着。别离开这个位置，好吗？"她缓缓点头，努力抓住松散的泥土。我脱下鞋子，将其以四十五度角朝天空方向放置在她前方约三英尺处，"现在，蹲下并抱住头。别动，好吗？"

"I swear, if I get hit by one of those things…" one comes barreling towards her, I get out of the way and let it roll to her. "Shinji!" she yelled as she held her head awaiting the impact.  
"我发誓，如果我被其中一个击中……"一个东西朝她冲来，我闪到一旁让它滚向她。"真嗣！"她大喊着，抱着头等待撞击。

"That asshole! He's going to let her get hit!" one of the girls was yelling at the TV, "Screw this guy! If he can't even take a hit for a girl, then forget him!"  
"那个混蛋！他要让那女孩被击中！"一个女孩对着电视大喊，"去他的！如果他连为女孩挡一下都做不到，那就别提了！"

"Pilot Ikari… has his reasons…" only one girl saw what was going on in Shinji's head.  
"碇真嗣…他有他的理由…"只有一位女孩看穿了真嗣内心的挣扎。

Takeshi's Castel 武藏堡

The boulder hits the shoe and easily flies over her head.  
巨石击中鞋子，轻易地从她头顶飞过。

"YES! Okay Asuka, just stay there, I'll call you when it's safe," I hear her mutter something in German, but I brush it off. I climb up to the shogun – which was standing on a long, flat platform, making it easy for him and me to move – and stare him down, "Now for you…" he charged at me with the bat. I simply duck and slid under his legs, then kicked him off of the platform, making him tumble down the hill and drop his bat in front of me.  
"太好了！好吧，Asuka，就待在那儿，安全了我再叫你。" 我听到她用德语嘀咕了些什么，但我没在意。我爬上了那个站在长而平的平台上的将军——这让他和我移动起来都很方便——然后盯着他，"现在轮到你了……" 他拿着棒子向我冲来。我轻松地蹲下并从他双腿间滑过，然后一脚把他踢下了平台，让他滚下山坡，棒子也掉在了我面前。

"I love a man with brains and brawn!" the same girl yelled after insulting him. A certain quiet girl got up and stared her down, "And what's up with you?"  
"我喜欢既有头脑又有力量的男人！" 同一个女孩在侮辱他之后喊道。一个平时安静的女孩站了起来，盯着她，"那你又有什么问题？"

"I would appreciate it if you refrain from acting as if Ikari is a toy. Now please get your hormones under control and calm down," even with her monotone voice, it was still able to get the girl to follow her orders.  
"我希望你不要把碇当作玩具。现在请控制好你的荷尔蒙，冷静下来，" 尽管她的声音单调，但仍然能让那个女孩听从她的命令。

"I'm sorry…" "对不起…"

"Do not apologize to me; apologize to Pilot Ikari when he returns…"  
"不要向我道歉；等一尉真嗣回来时向他道歉…"

Takeshi's Castel 剑士的城堡

"Shinji! Can I get up yet? These boulders are starting to creep me out!" another one flew over her head. I pick up the bat and make my way back to her.  
"真嗣！我可以起来了吗？这些巨石开始让我毛骨悚然了！" 又一块石头从她头顶飞过。我拿起球棒，朝她走去。

"Okay, when I tell you to, get up and stay behind me, okay?" I lean back, dodging one of the boulders, "Did you hear me?"  
"好，我一告诉你，你就起来，然后躲在我后面，好吗？" 我向后一靠，躲开一块巨石，"你听到了吗？"

"YES! Now just hurry up!" as one more boulder came, I stepped in front of her and hit the heavy plastic boulder, making it fly through the air.  
"听到了！快点！" 又一块巨石飞来，我挡在她前面，用力击打那块沉重的塑料巨石，让它飞向空中。

"Okay Asuka, you can get up now," she raised her head and brought herself to her feet, "Now just stay behind me, then when we get to the top you can wale on Takeshi all you want…" I hit another boulder away as we start to climb.  
“好了，明日香，现在可以起来了，”她抬起头，站起身来，“现在就站在我后面，等我们到了顶上，你想怎么揍武就可以怎么揍……”我们开始攀爬时，我又推开了一块巨石。

"You're sure taking charge today… any particular reason?" she was right, I actually felt powerful today. As for the reason, I had absolutely no idea. I just had the feeling that I was somehow becoming well liked… what? Damn I need to get more sleep…  
“你今天真是指挥若定啊……有什么特别的原因吗？”她说得没错，我今天确实感觉很有力量。至于原因，我完全不知道。我只是有种感觉，好像自己越来越受欢迎了……什么？该死，我需要多睡会儿……

"No…" I hit one last boulder, "But I do like doing this with you. I like it when we work as a team…" before she could say anything, I cut back in, "Well, we're at the top. Now where's Takeshi?" we were in the middle of a large dirt platform set atop that hill.  
“没有……”我推开了最后一块巨石，“但我确实喜欢和你一起做这件事。我喜欢我们作为一个团队合作的时候……”她还没来得及说什么，我就打断了她，“好了，我们到顶了。武在哪里？”我们站在那座小山顶上的一个大土平台上。

"Well, well, well… looks like our young heroes have made it all the way up to Takeshi's castle… now one question remains…" the man in red popped up from under the ground wearing what looked like a emperor's uniform, "Can you take me on?" I hear Asuka crack her knuckles.  
"哎呀，哎呀，哎呀……看来我们的年轻英雄们已经一路闯到了武的城堡……现在只剩下一个问题……" 身穿看似皇帝制服的红衣男子从地下冒了出来，"你能接受我的挑战吗？" 我听到明日香活动她的指关节。

"He's all yours…" I step to one side and leave her alone.  
"他是你的了……" 我向旁边退了一步，让她独自面对。

"So… I'm a cold hearted bitch, huh? Okay… I'll take that… but when you insult my body…" her eyes set aflame, "YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR!" she charged at him full speed with a drawn fist. He simply put up a hand, and for some reason Asuka stopped running.  
"所以……我是个冷酷无情的婊子，是吗？好吧……我接受这个评价……但当你侮辱我的身体时……" 她的眼中燃起了怒火，"你已经越界了！" 她全速冲向他，紧握着拳头。他只是简单地举起一只手，不知为何明日香停下了脚步。

"Hold on my dear girl, this is not a physical fight…" she shot up immediately.  
"亲爱的，别急，这不是一场肉搏战……" 她立刻跳了起来。

"Yes it is! It has always been like this on this damn show! The winner gets to fight Takeshi!" why was she arguing? Kick his ass!  
"就是肉搏！这该死的节目一直都是这样！胜者才能挑战武司！" 她为什么还在争辩？踢他的屁股！

"Um… that has… changed…" he cowering out! "Now you will simply fight your way TO me, then you win… so no harm to Takeshi!" Asuka turns red with anger.  
"呃……规则……变了……" 他畏缩地说，"现在你只需一路打过来找我，然后你就赢了……所以不会伤害到武司！" 明日香气得满脸通红。

"Hell no! You insult me up and down, and I don't even get to land a punch? I don't play that way, bitch!" ouch… he was blushing bright red! "So you have two choices here, either I kick your sorry ass, or I… you know what? There is no second option!" she charges at him and punches his face, making him fall back, "You gonna fight back?"  
"门都没有！你对我上下其手，我连一拳都打不到？我可不是那种玩法，贱人！" 哎呀…他脸红得像番茄一样！"所以你有两个选择，要么我踢爆你的屁股，要么…你知道吗？没有第二个选项！" 她冲向他，一拳打在脸上，让他后退几步，"你还手吗？"

"Hey! Another punch like that and you're out of this competition!" she takes a deep breath.  
"嘿！再来一拳，你就出局了！" 她深吸一口气。

"Fine…" she walks up to him and holds out her hand, apparently trying to help him up. When he was up, she knees him in the groin, "It's not like we win anything on this game show! What's gonna happen? You kick us out? We're done already!"  
"好吧…" 她走到他面前，伸出手，显然是想扶他起来。当他站稳后，她用膝盖顶向他的下体，"这个游戏节目又没什么奖品！能怎么样？把我们踢出去？我们早就完蛋了！"

Tokyo-3 – School 第三新东京市 – 学校

As Asuka began to pummel Takeshi, the boys stared with smiles on there faces as the girls were steaming with anger.  
当明日香开始猛击武的时候，男生们脸上带着笑容盯着看，而女生们则气得满脸通红。

"Man, watching Asuka beat up on someone besides me is awesome! Who knew she was so strong?" Toji cupped his boys at the student's comment. He knew exactly how strong she was…  
"哇，看明日香揍别人而不是我真是太爽了！谁知道她这么强？" 当听到学生的评论时，冬二握紧了拳头。他非常清楚她的力量……

"Look at that…" one of the girls had a disgusted face on, "How could Shinji be dating HER? She's so… violent. I mean, she used to beat on him on a daily basis, and now all of the sudden they're damn near attached at the hip! Shinji deserves a better girl then that!" all of the girls nodded.  
"看看那……" 其中一个女生露出厌恶的表情，"真嗣怎么会和她约会？她太……暴力了。我是说，她以前每天都打他，现在突然之间他们几乎形影不离！真嗣值得更好的女孩！" 所有女生都点头表示同意。

"He deserves a kind girl…"  
"他值得一个善良的女孩…"

"He deserves a cute girl…"  
"他值得一个可爱的女孩…"

"He deserves a smart girl…" a long pause, then all of them speak at once.  
"他值得一个聪明的女孩…" 长时间的停顿后，他们齐声说道。

"He deserves me…" a lot of yelling and bickering soon followed.  
“他配得上我……”紧接着便是一阵激烈的争吵和叫喊。

Car – Riding Home 车载——归家途中

Asuka – with a smile – counted off a few bills in her hand. Not only did she beat the living crap out of him, but she took his wallet! After he fainted – around the fourth kick to the groin – she reached down and pulled out his wallet!  
明日香带着微笑，手中数着几张钞票。她不仅把他打得半死，还拿走了他的钱包！在他昏迷后——大约是第四次踢到他的下体时——她弯腰取出了他的钱包！

"I'm glad I came… that guy was loaded!" she laughs.  
"我很高兴我来了……那家伙可是个有钱人！" 她笑着说。

"Why did you steal his wallet? Was that really necessary?" Gendo – as always – was being a hypocrite. He would gladly kill a person just to keep his position, and now he's talking about morals?  
"你为什么要偷他的钱包？真的有必要吗？" 碇司令一如既往地虚伪。他为了保住自己的地位，杀人都不眨眼，现在却谈起道德来了？

"Yes, yes it was. You see, for some reason saving to world wasn't enough to get a paycheck off of, so I have to find other ways!" Asuka slipped the money in her pocket.  
"是的，确实有必要。你看，不知为何拯救世界并不能换来薪水，所以我得另寻他法！" 明日香把钱塞进了口袋。

"You are children, why would you need money?" well, for me at least, I'm the one that buys most of the food. Misato just buys beer…  
"你们还是孩子，要钱做什么？" 至少对我来说，我才是买大部分食物的那个人。美里只买啤酒……

"And you're head of NERV; don't you get supported from them? Why do you need a paycheck?"  
"而且你是 NERV 的负责人；他们不给你支持吗？为什么还需要薪水？"

"Point taken…" the car went silent for the rest of the ride. Asuka eventually fell asleep leaning on the door, Gendo – I think – was asleep as well, but I wasn't too sure. Once again, just me and Fuyutsuki were left. When we were starting to get into sight of Misato's apartment, he spoke up.  
"说得有理……" 车内在剩下的路程中一片寂静。明日香最终靠在车门上睡着了，碇司令——我想——也睡着了，但我不是很确定。又一次，只剩下我和冬月。当我们开始看到美里的公寓时，他开口了。

"So… you finally did it… how does it feel?" he whispered as he spoke.  
"所以…你终于说出口了…感觉如何？" 他低声说道。

"Huh?" what was he talking about?  
"啊？" 他在说什么？

"You know, saying 'I love you' to Asuka. We only heard a few words of the conversation, but we did hear 'I love you, Asuka'. Did she say it back?" why am I even talking about his to him? Come to think of it, he's acting like more of a father then Gendo is!  
"你知道的，对明日香说'我爱你'。我们只听到了几句对话，但我们确实听到了'我爱你，明日香'。她回应了吗？" 我为什么要跟他说这些？话说回来，他表现得比源堂更像一个父亲！

"Um… yeah, she did…" I saw him smile through the rear-view mirror.  
"嗯…是的，她确实…" 我从后视镜中看到他笑了。

"That's great, I'm glad you two have finally gotten to this point… so… what now?" how the hell was I supposed to know? This is the first time I've said those words to anyone, let alone my girlfriend…  
"那太好了，我很高兴你们俩终于到了这一步…那么…现在怎么办？" 我他妈怎么知道？这是我第一次对任何人说这些话，更别提对我的女朋友了…

"I… don't know… what is supposed to happen now? I mean, is there anything more to this then what has already been done?" he chuckles a little.  
"我…不知道…现在应该发生什么？我是说，除了已经发生的事情之外，还有别的吗？" 他轻声笑了一下。

"You'll find out eventually…" okay… I knew what he was talking about now…  
"你迟早会知道的……" 好吧……我现在明白他在说什么了……

"Can we drop this… please?" the car once again went silent. A few minutes later we were in front of Misato's. "Asuka, we're home. Wake up," I nudge her and she raises her head to meet mine, "We're home," she smiles and jumps out of the car… I take it she wants to leave! "Bye Fuyutsuki, thanks for inviting us…" I climb out of the car and follow Asuka to the front door… ah crap… I just thanked Fuyutsuki and not Gendo… oops.  
"我们能别提这个了吗……求你了？" 车内再次陷入沉默。几分钟后，我们停在美里家门前。"明日香，我们到家了。醒醒，" 我轻推她，她抬起头与我四目相对，"我们到家了，" 她微笑着跳下车……看来她是想快点离开！"再见，冬月，谢谢你的邀请……" 我爬出车外，跟着明日香走向前门……啊糟糕……我刚刚感谢了冬月而不是源堂……哎呀。

"I'm so glad to be home!" She opened the door and I followed her inside. We were immediately brought into a tight embrace by Misato.  
"回家真好！" 她打开门，我跟着她进去。我们立刻被美里紧紧抱住。

"You two are okay! I was so worried!" she cried as she held us.  
"你们俩没事！我担心死了！" 她一边哭着一边抱住我们。

"I… can't… breathe…" I hear Asuka mutter. Misato lets us go and apologizes.  
"我… 喘不过气了…" 我听到明日香低声说。美里放开我们并道歉。

"Oh… sorry…" she wipes a tear away, "So no injuries? No cuts? Bruises? Nothing?" she scans over our bodies.  
"哦… 对不起…" 她擦去眼泪，"那么没有受伤吗？没有伤口？没有淤青？什么都没有？" 她仔细检查我们的身体。

"No, Asuka got a dislocated finger, but aside from that we're fine."  
“不，明日香只是手指脱臼了，除此之外我们都还好。”

"Oh yeah, easy for you to say! That hurt like a bitch when you pulled it back in place!" Misato went wide eyed.  
“哦，当然了，你说得倒轻松！你把它复位的时候疼得要命！”美里瞪大了眼睛。

"Shinji did that? Shinji IKARI fixed your finger?" Asuka nods, "Wow… looks like you're really growing up Shinji! When I first met you, you would have freaked out at that!" was that a compliment?  
“真嗣做的？真嗣·碇帮你把手指复位了？”明日香点头道，“哇……看来你真的在成长啊，真嗣！我第一次见你的时候，你肯定会吓得不知所措的！”这是在夸你吗？

"Um… thank you? And Asuka, if it hurt so much, why didn't you say anything?" we both knew what I was talking about, but neither of us were going to say anything.  
"嗯…谢谢？还有，明日香，如果那么痛，你为什么不吭声？" 我们都知道我在说什么，但谁也没打算挑明。

"What, am I supposed to scream after you said THAT?" or not…  
"什么，难道我该在你说了那话之后尖叫吗？" 还是别了…

"Shinji? What did you say?" Asuka realizes what she just said and slaps her forehead. Great, now Misato's going to know!  
"真嗣？你刚才说什么了？" 明日香意识到自己刚刚的话，拍了拍额头。糟了，这下美里要知道了！

"Ugh… he… okay, WE said…" she took a long pause.  
"呃…他…好吧，我们说了…"她停顿了很久。

"I love you?" Misato chuckles, "Sorry couldn't help myself. What'd you guys say?" Asuka raises her head and smiles nervously.  
"我爱你？"美里轻笑，"抱歉，忍不住逗你。你们说了什么？"明日香抬起头，紧张地笑了笑。

"Actually… yeah…" she grabs my hand and pecks me on the cheek, "We said that…" Misato nearly faints at the sight, and so do I. Did Asuka just kiss me in front of Misato? Not that I was complaining about getting a kiss from her – that I was okay with – just the way she presented it was… odd.  
"实际上…是的…"她抓住我的手，在我脸颊上轻轻一吻，"我们说了…"美里看到这一幕几乎晕倒，我也一样。明日香刚刚在美里面前吻了我？不是说我介意她吻我——我对此没意见——只是她表现出来的方式…有点奇怪。

"Y-You… said…" she was damn near sweating!  
"你…你…说…" 她简直快紧张得冒汗了！

"Yeah, don't make such a big deal about it. We felt it so we said it," Asuka sure seemed very open with this. I'm actually relieved that she's okay with talking about it.  
"是啊，别大惊小怪的。我们感觉到了就说了，" 明日香对此似乎非常坦然。我其实松了一口气，她能这么坦率地谈论这件事。

"Okay… sorry… oh! I almost forgot! I have some great news! Guess what happened when you were away?" I'm sorry, but she just set us up for this one. I mean, what HAS been happening ever since Kaji and her got together?  
"好吧…对不起…哦！我差点忘了！我有个好消息！猜猜你不在的时候发生了什么？" 抱歉，但她这明显是在给我们设套。我是说，自从加持和她在一起后，到底发生了些什么？

"You're pregnant?" Asuka started us off…  
"你怀孕了？" 明日香率先开口……

"You actually went on a date with Kaji?"  
"你真的和加持去约会了？"

"SHUT UP!" before we could go on, Misato cut us off, "Quit being smartasses! This is serious!" she held up her hand and showed off a ring with a pretty big diamond in it, "Kaji… asked me to marry him…" me and Asuka both nearly faint.  
"闭嘴！" 在我们继续之前，美里打断了我们，"别耍聪明了！这是认真的！" 她举起手，展示了一枚镶有相当大钻石的戒指，"加持……向我求婚了……" 我和明日香都差点晕倒。

"He… what? Are you serious?" she nodded at my question.  
"他……什么？你是认真的吗？" 她对我点了点头。

"Yep! The wedding is going to be a two months!" so soon?  
"是的！婚礼将在两个月后举行！" 这么快？

"It's about time! You two have been sleeping together for years now, you'd think this would have happened earlier!" Asuka was actually smiling! Was she happy for them? None the less, that was nice of her even if it was fake.  
"早就该办了！你们俩同居这么多年了，我还以为这事早就发生了呢！" 明日香居然在笑！她是为他们高兴吗？不管怎样，即使那是假的，她的这份心意也挺好的。

"Oh, ha, ha Asuka. Just for that little comment, you two are going to school today. I WAS going to let you have the day off, but there's still plenty of time to make it!" ah damn it… "No hurry up and go get dressed, I'll drive you."  
"哦，哈哈，明日香。就因为那句小评论，你们俩今天得去上学了。我本来打算让你们放一天假的，但时间还早，来得及！" 啊，该死… "别磨蹭了，快去换衣服，我开车送你们。"

"Oh come on! It was a joke!" Misato firmly pointed to Asuka's room, "Fine…" we both slug to our rooms. Man! I didn't want to go to school! For some reason, I had a really bad feeling about going…  
"哎呀，别这样！那只是个玩笑！" 美里坚定地指向明日香的房间，"好吧…" 我们俩拖着沉重的脚步回到各自的房间。天哪！我根本不想去学校！不知为何，我有一种非常不好的预感…

School – Thirty Minutes Later  
学校 – 三十分钟后

"Bye kids! Have fun!" Asuka flips off Misato as she drives off.  
“再见孩子们！玩得开心！” 明日香对美里竖了个中指，看着她开车离去。

"Well, we might as well get going, not like we have much of a choice here," with heads hung low, we begin to walk into the school. Asuka held my hand in hers as we walked, "You think we missed much?"  
“好吧，我们还是走吧，反正也没什么选择，”我们低着头，开始向学校走去。明日香握着我的手，我们一起走着，“你觉得我们错过了很多吗？”

"No. All that dumb ass teacher talks about is sex-ed, so we're fine," she was right about that. I was starting to think that this guy was a pervert…  
“没有。那个傻瓜老师整天就讲性教育，所以我们没事，”她说的没错。我开始怀疑这家伙是不是个变态……

"Hope so," when we finally get into the class room, we were met with silence, then a loud wave of applause.  
“希望如此，”当我们终于进入教室时，迎接我们的是一片寂静，随后是热烈的掌声。

"Nice job Ikari!" don't tell me they saw that crap…  
“干得好，碇！”别告诉我他们看到了那糟糕的一幕……

"What'd you guys win?" they did…  
“你们赢了什么？”他们确实看到了……

"Okay class, calm down, I think Ikari and Souryu are very tired after all that, so let's just get back to the lesson. You two may take your seat," we release each other's hands and walk to our desks. Before I could even open my laptop I heard the beeping of about twenty messages. I close them all without reading them and send a message to Asuka.  
“好了，同学们，安静下来，我想碇和惣流经过刚才那番折腾已经很累了，我们继续上课吧。你们两个可以回座位了。” 我们松开彼此的手，走向自己的桌子。我还没来得及打开笔记本电脑，就听到大约二十条消息的提示音。我一条都没看就全部关闭，然后给明日香发了一条消息。

Just like before, the screens went black and the teacher began to yell. I just ignored it; why listen to his ramble when I could be getting a well-deserved nap? I lay my head down and eventually fall asleep. That feeling that something really bad was about to happen never left me, but I just tried to ignore it.  
一如往常，屏幕变黑，老师开始咆哮。我置若罔闻；与其听他唠叨，不如享受一场应得的午睡。我把头枕在桌上，不久便沉沉睡去。那种即将发生糟糕事情的感觉始终挥之不去，但我只是试图忽视它。

"Do you always get your sleep in class? You're going to get caught one of these days!" Asuka kicks my desk and wakes me up, "Come on, it's lunch and we need to go buy it… damn cafeteria food…" get up and begin to walk out of the class room with her.  
"你上课总是打瞌睡吗？总有一天会被抓到的！" 明日香踢了踢我的桌子，把我叫醒，"快点，午饭时间到了，我们得去买……该死的食堂饭菜……" 我起身，和她一起走出教室。

"Sorry, but I obviously didn't make lunches for us. I'll make them tomorrow," to my surprise, she grabbed my hand as we walked. Looks like she's starting to become more open with this…  
"抱歉，我显然没给我们准备午餐。明天我会做的，" 令我惊讶的是，她在我们走路时抓住了我的手。看来她开始在这方面变得更加开放了……

"Don't worry about it, let's just hope what they have is eatable…" we buy our lunches – which were both the salad… why take chances here? – and head back to our classroom. When we get back we see the normal groupings of friends, except for Toji, who was eating in the corner by himself. Asuka and I take our seats with Hikari, Rei and Kensuke.  
"别担心，只希望他们提供的东西能吃……" 我们买了午餐——都是沙拉……这里何必冒险呢？——然后回到教室。我们回来时，看到朋友们通常的聚集情况，除了冬二，他独自一人在角落里吃着。明日香和我与光、丽和真希波一起坐下。

"Hey guys, had to buy lunch today?" we both nod, "I'm… sorry…" Hikari smirked.  
"嘿，伙计们，今天得去买午饭了？" 我们俩都点了点头，"我……抱歉……" 光咧嘴笑了。

"So, anything happen when we were away?" might as well find out what we missed, right?  
"那么，我们不在的时候有什么事发生吗？" 不妨了解一下我们错过了什么，对吧？

"Well… we just watched Takeshi's Castle for the whole time…" both Hikari and Rei glance up at me and blush slightly, "That's it…" what was up with them?  
"嗯……我们整个时间都在看《智勇大冲关》……" 光和零都抬头看了我一眼，脸颊微微泛红，"就这些……" 他们这是怎么了？

"I believe that Shinji's… ending strategy made a fight between the female students…" Rei didn't lift her eyes from her food as she spoke, "Aside from Hikari and myself of course…" Hikari slapped the back of her head, "Ouch…"  
"我认为真嗣的……结局策略导致了女学生之间的战斗……" 绫波并没有从她的食物上抬起眼睛，"当然，除了光和我自己之外……" 光拍了拍自己的后脑勺，"哎哟……"

"I told you not to tell them!" Asuka dropped her chop sticks and slammed her hands down on the table.  
"我告诉过你不要告诉他们！" 明日香丢下筷子，双手猛地拍在桌子上。

"What were they saying?" her voice was sharp as she spoke… uh oh…  
"他们在说什么？" 她说话时声音尖锐……哦哦……

"Um… nothing…" Hikari went back to her meal nervously.  
"嗯…没什么…" 光紧张地继续吃她的饭。

"Hikari, tell me!" I can see where this is going… crap!  
"光，告诉我！" 我能看出这事的走向…糟糕！

"Do I have to?" Asuka glared at her, "Fine… all they were doing was goggling over Shinji's body after he took off his shirt, no big deal."  
"我非得说吗？" 明日香瞪着她，"好吧…他们只是在真嗣脱掉衬衫后盯着他的身体看，没什么大不了的。"

"I believe that they were also speaking of how smart, 'hot', and kind Ikari was. I heard one say that she'd 'like to share a bed' with him. I don't see how sharing a bed has to do with anything…" Hikari once again hit her in the back of the head, "Ouch…"  
"我相信她们也在谈论碇同学有多聪明、'帅气'和善良。我听到有人说她'想和他共床'。我不明白共床和这些有什么关系……" 光又一次敲了她的后脑勺，"哎哟……"

"Thank you so much Rei for your input!" Asuka was fuming at this point. Just at the wrong time, one girl – Etsumi I think her name is – came up and put her hands on my desk, then leaning towards me. She was known for going through boys faster than food, and it's apparent why. Sure, she was cute – many of the guys call her hot – but just not my type. She had long brown hair and… a decent chest…  
"非常感谢你的意见，绫波！" 此时，明日香已经气得不行。就在这个不合时宜的时刻，一个女孩——我想她叫悦美——走了过来，把手放在我的桌子上，然后向我倾身。她以比吃东西还快的速度换男朋友而闻名，这也不难理解。确实，她很可爱——很多男生都说她很性感——但不是我的菜。她有一头长长的棕色头发和……不错的胸部……

"Hey there Shinji, how ya doing?" I just keep quiet and try to keep my eyes on her face, "Oh, quiet are we? Well, I'll just skip to the main point, okay? How about you dump that demon and go out with me, huh? I can give you something that she won't…" I avert my eyes back to my meal and take a bite.  
"嘿，真嗣，你怎么样？" 我只是保持沉默，尽量把目光停留在她的脸上，"哦，安静是吧？那我就直奔主题了，好吗？你甩了那个恶魔，和我出去怎么样？我能给你她给不了的东西……" 我把目光移回到我的餐盘上，咬了一口。

"Sorry, but I won't do that. You should try and find someone that actually knows you enough to say your name, and then ask THEM out. And I'd appreciate it if you'd not call Asuka that," she went red at my statement. Hell, even I was surprised I said that!  
"对不起，但我不会那么做。你应该试着找到一个真正了解你到能叫出你名字的人，然后请他们出去。还有，如果你不那样称呼明日香，我会很感激的，" 她听了我的话脸红了。见鬼，连我自己都惊讶我会这么说！

"Oh come on, you know it to be true!" I continue to eat my meal, "Hey! Look up when I'm talking to you!"  
"哦，得了吧，你知道这是真的！" 我继续吃我的饭，"嘿！我跟你说话的时候看着我！"

"He said no you rag bitch!" holy crap! Asuka was pissed!  
"他说不，你这个烂婊子！" 天哪！明日香气炸了！

"Why don't you mind your own business for once?" Asuka leaped up and took my wrist, then drug me to the front of the class.  
“你能不能有一次别管闲事？”明日香跳起来抓住我的手腕，然后把我拽到教室前面。

"Hey! Listen up! I understand that some of the girls in this class were talking about MY Shinji, well guess what? This baka is taken, and will REMAIN taken!" she grabbed my collar and pulled me into a deep kiss… holy crap! What was she doing?! This wasn't a damn peck, she was really kissing me! In front of the whole class none the less! After thirty seconds, she pulled back and glared back at the classroom, "Get it?" all of the girls were fuming, and even a few guys, "Good!" she takes me back to my seat – Etsumi now gone – and sits me down.  
“嘿！听好了！我知道班上有些女生在议论我的真嗣，好吧，猜猜怎么着？这个笨蛋已经有主了，而且会一直有主！”她抓住我的衣领，把我拉过去深深地吻了一下……我的天！她在干什么？！这可不是什么浅尝辄止的吻，她是真的在吻我！还是在全班面前！三十秒后，她才松开，瞪着全班同学，“明白了吗？”所有女生都气得要命，甚至有几个男生也是，“很好！”她把我带回座位——江角已经不见了——然后让我坐下。

"Wow… wasn't that a little drastic? I mean, you just made out in front of the whole class…" Asuka shrugs and takes a bite.  
“哇……是不是有点过激了？我是说，你刚刚在全班面前接吻了……”明日香耸耸肩，咬了一口。

"Yeah, but I got my point across, didn't I?" the whole class was still silent from what just happened, "Yeah, I think I did."  
"是啊，但我把话说清楚了，不是吗？" 整个班级还沉浸在刚刚发生的事情中，一片寂静，"嗯，我想我说得很明白了。"

"Asuka and Shinji, sitting in a tree, F-U-C-K-I-N-G …" Kensuke mumbled under his breath, and was quickly met with a slap from Asuka.  
"明日香和真嗣，坐在树上，F-U-C-K-I-N-G……" 剑介低声咕哝着，随即被明日香一巴掌打断。

"Pervert…" he got a good laugh, and then he got another slap.  
"变态……" 他刚笑出声，接着又挨了一巴掌。

Walking Home – After School  
步行回家 – 放学后

"Rei, seriously, drop it. I'm starting to get annoyed," we were walking home with Rei, and she WOULD NOT drop the whole sleeping in the same bed thing.  
"丽，说真的，别再提了。我开始觉得烦了，"我们和丽一起走回家，她就是不肯放下那个睡同一张床的话题。

"I am just curious to know what beds have to do with Ikari," wait… why is she even still here? We passed her house a few minutes ago. Was she really that intent on finding out what it meant?  
"我只是好奇床和碇有什么关系，"等等…她怎么还在这里？我们几分钟前就经过她家了。她真的那么想知道这意味着什么吗？

"Fine, it means sex! They want to have sex with MY Shinji! Happy?" Rei cocked her head with a confused look.  
"好吧，就是指性行为！他们想和我的真嗣发生关系！满意了吗？" 绫波歪着头，一脸困惑。

"Oh… what is 'sex'?" we both nearly faint. Damn, I knew Rei was behind socially, but to not know was sex was… damn! I mean, she's fourteen! How could she not know?  
"哦……'性'是什么？" 我们俩差点晕倒。该死，我知道绫波在社交上有些落后，但连性是什么都不知道……真是够了！我是说，她才十四岁！怎么可能不知道呢？

"I hope you're kidding!" Rei shakes her head, "Holy crap… Shinji, a little help here, I'd rather not give the talk to Wondergirl…" and how was I supposed to help?  
"我希望你在开玩笑！" 绫波摇摇头，"天哪……真嗣，帮帮忙吧，我可不想给这位冰山美人上性教育课……" 而我又能怎么帮忙呢？

"Um… well… intercourse is… do I have to do this?"  
"嗯…这个…性行为是…我必须这么做吗？"

"Oh, you mean the joining of bodies genitally? Yes, I know what this is," did she have to put it that way?  
"哦，你是说通过生殖器进行身体结合？是的，我知道这是什么，""她非得这么直白地说吗？"

"OKAY! Changing subject! Rei, why are you tagging along? We passed your house awhile ago," thank you Asuka!  
"好吧！换个话题！丽，你为什么要跟着我们？我们刚才已经过了你家了，""谢谢你，明日香！"

"Commander Ikari instructed me to do so. Apparently Major Katsuragi has something to tell me," I knew that there was a reason! Wonder what Misato had to tell us, maybe it was something about the Evas… hopefully those things were going to be destroyed. Eh, I'm thinking to high.  
“碇司令指示我这么做。显然葛城美里少校有话要告诉我，”我知道一定有原因！不知道美里要告诉我们什么，也许是关于 EVA 的事情……希望那些东西会被销毁。唉，我想得太多了。

"Really? Well hurry up and talk to her, I don't want you in there for too long," that was kinda rude…  
“真的吗？那快去跟她谈谈吧，我不想你在里面待太久，”这话有点不礼貌……

"Okay…" as we walked up to the apartment, Misato yelling could be heard through the door.  
“好的……”我们走向公寓时，门后传来了美里的喊声。

"Wonder what's up with her…" Asuka slowly opens the door and reveals Misato yelling over the phone.  
“不知道她怎么了…” 明日香缓缓打开门，露出美里正对着电话大喊的情景。

"But why should they move out just because of that?" moving out? "Yes, I understand that, but-… yes, I know… I have damn near raised those children! You have no right to-… I don't care what you've heard! If you ask those kids then they will tell you just how I have taken care of them! I would never do anything inappropriate around them!" this really doesn't sound good… "You wouldn't do that to them! They no longer have homes there!" homes where? "But-… but I-… ugh… okay… they'll be there by the end of the night…" she hangs up the phone and wipes away a tear. She turns and looks at us standing in the doorway, all – even Rei – with wide eyes.  
“但为什么他们就因为那件事要搬出去？”搬出去？“是的，我明白，但是——…是的，我知道…我几乎把那些孩子拉扯大了！你无权——…我不在乎你听到了什么！如果你问那些孩子，他们会告诉你我是如何照顾他们的！我绝不会在他们周围做出任何不适当的行为！”这听起来真不妙…“你不会那样对他们！他们在那里已经没有家了！”家在哪里？“但是——…但是我——…呃…好吧…他们今晚之前会到那里的…”她挂断电话，擦去一滴泪水。她转过身，看着我们站在门口，所有人——甚至包括丽——都瞪大了眼睛。

"What's going on?" Asuka sounded concerned for once.  
“发生什么事了？”明日香这次听起来真的担心了。

"I'm so sorry…" Misato walks over and hugs me and Asuka, "You're going to have to move out of here…" Asuka tore back and glared at Misato.  
"我真的很抱歉…" 美里走过来抱住我和明日香，"你们得搬出这里了…" 明日香猛地挣脱并瞪着美里。

"Are you serious? I don't wanna move!"  
"你是认真的吗？我不想搬家！"

"It's either that or Germany, your choice. Gendo is forcing you two to move out because he thought me and Kaji will interfere with your piloting skills… I'm so sorry…" she wipes away another tear.  
"要么搬家，要么去德国，你自己选。源堂强迫你们搬走，因为他认为我和加持会干扰你们的驾驶技能…我真的很抱歉…" 她擦去另一滴泪水。

"And if we refuse? What then?" I wasn't about to move out of my home!  
“如果我们拒绝呢？那又怎样？”我可没打算搬出我的家！

"Then you'll move back in with your aunt and uncle, and you'll never see Asuka again. He was originally going to have you live in North Japan while Asuka moved to the West, but I convinced him to let you move in with Rei instead. That's the best I could do," move in with Rei? That didn't sound TOO bad. I mean, we'd still be pretty close to Misato and even closer to the school.  
“那样的话，你就得搬回去和你姑姑姑父住，再也见不到明日香了。他原本打算让你住在北日本，而明日香搬到西边，但我劝他让你搬去和绫住。这是我所能争取到的最好结果了。”搬去和绫住？听起来还不算太糟。我的意思是，我们还是会离美里很近，甚至离学校更近。

"WONDERGIRL?!" maybe it's not so good… "I am not moving in with that blue haired bitch! I'd rather go back to Germany than do that!" Misato walked into Asuka's room and came back out holding two large suitcases.  
“奇迹女孩？！”也许没那么好……“我绝不会搬去和那个蓝毛婊子住！我宁愿回德国也不干这事！”美里走进明日香的房间，拿着两个大行李箱走了出来。

"Then go. There's a NERV base in Germany, you'll still be able to do whatever Gendo wants. You'll never see anyone you know again, including Shinji!" Misato was trying to prove a point here… I hope. Asuka kept quiet for awhile before speaking up.  
"那就去吧。德国有个 NERV 基地，你依然可以做任何碇司令想要的事。你将再也见不到任何你认识的人，包括真嗣！" 美里试图在这里证明一个观点……我希望如此。明日香沉默了一会儿，然后开口说道。

"Fine… but where are we going to sleep? Her apartment only has one room!"  
"好吧……但我们睡哪儿？她的公寓只有一个房间！"

"I know that! We're moving in two beds, one for you and one for Shinji. Sorry, but it will have to be in the same room," I was a little confused about this. Gendo won't let us stay in Misato's – an adult's – apartment because of Kaji, but he'll let three teenagers with raging hormones live together and sleep within a few feet of each other? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense!  
"我知道！我们会搬两张床，一张给你，一张给真嗣。抱歉，但只能放在同一个房间里，" 我对这一点有些困惑。碇司令不让我们留在美里——一个成年人的——公寓里，因为害怕加持，但他会让三个荷尔蒙旺盛的青少年住在一起，并且睡在彼此几英尺之内？是的，这很有道理！

"So when do we have to leave?" Misato once again frowned.  
"那我们什么时候得出发？" 美里再次皱起了眉头。

"Tomorrow morning. Rei, you haven't said anything yet, are you okay with this?" it's not like it mattered…  
"明天早上。丽，你还没说什么呢，你对此没意见吧？" 反正也不重要……

"It is an order from the commander, it does not matter what I think," Asuka sighed.  
"这是司令的命令，我的想法无关紧要，" 明日香叹了口气。

"See what I mean? She's a damn doll! Do you even have emotions?" I really hope that I can convince Gendo to let us live in Misato's apartment… this constant bickering is going to kill me.  
"明白我的意思了吗？她简直就是个该死的玩偶！你到底有没有感情？" 我真的希望能说服源堂让我们住在美里小姐的公寓里……这种无休止的争吵简直要了我的命。

"By emotions you mean annoyance, then yes," whoa! Rei actually had a comeback!  
"你说的是恼怒吧，那确实有，" 哇！丽居然反击了！

"What did you just say to me?" Asuka was just as surprised as I was! Rei reached out and tugged on one of Asuka's ears, "Hey! What the hell are you doing?"  
"你刚才对我说了什么？" 明日香和我一样惊讶！丽伸出手拽了一下明日香的耳朵，"嘿！你到底在干什么？"

"You seem to have ears… so you did hear me, correct?" holy crap! This is friggen awesome!  
"你似乎有耳朵……所以你确实听到了，对吧？" 天哪！这太棒了！

"Are you being cocky with ME? Listen here you bi-"  
"你是在跟我耍横吗？听着，你这个双——"

"OKAY Asuka, enough of that. You're going to have to get along with Rei from now on; Gendo said that if he finds any disturbance between you two then he will go off with his original plan, okay?" Both Rei and Asuka nod, "Good, now Rei, you should get home, it'll be getting dark pretty soon," Rei nods and leaves without a word.  
"好了，绫波，够了。从现在开始你得和丽好好相处；源堂说了，如果他发现你们俩之间有什么不和，他就会按原计划行事，明白吗？" 绫波和丽都点了点头，"很好，现在丽，你该回家了，天很快就要黑了，" 丽点了点头，一言不发地离开了。

"You know, Germany isn't sounding that bad right now… I'd be going if I could take Shinji with me…"  
"你知道吗，德国现在听起来还不错……如果能带上真嗣一起去就好了……"

"Yeah, like I'd let you two live together in a different country…" she walks off as we yell 'MISATO!'  
"是啊，就像我会让你们俩在另一个国家同居一样……" 她边走边喊着 '美里！'

"Damn it… I really don't wanna move…" we both sit on the couch and she turns on the TV.  
"该死……我真的不想搬家……" 我们俩一起坐在沙发上，她打开了电视。"

"I know, I don't want to either, but we really don't have a choice. Are you going to be okay with Won-… I mean REI?" damn! Now she's got me doing it!  
"我知道，我也不想这样，但我们真的别无选择。你能和绫……我是说零相处好吗？" 该死！现在连我也被带偏了！

"I'm rubbing off on ya Shinji… and yes, I'll manage. I just gotta put her in her place the first day, then she'll be an obedient little girl…" she was acting like Rei was a friggen dog!  
"我在影响你呢，真嗣……是的，我会应付的。第一天只要把她镇住，她就会乖乖听话……" 她表现得好像零是条狗似的！

"But it's her apartment, we have to act like guests when we're in there," actually, it'll be OUR apartment, but all the same, she was there first.  
"但那是她的公寓，我们在那里得表现得像客人，" 实际上，那将是我们的公寓，但不管怎样，她先住进去的。

"Whatever… what are you going to make for our last dinner here?" did she have to say that? I don't want to see this as our 'last dinner', I wanted this to be a normal sit down and eat night, nothing more, nothing less.  
"随便吧……你打算给我们在这里的最后一顿晚餐做什么？"她非得这么说吗？我不想把这当成'最后一顿晚餐'，我只想这是一个普通的坐下来吃饭的夜晚，仅此而已。

"Well, what do you want?" what ever happened to her cooking anyway? Damn it! She did it again! She got out of something by distracting me AGAIN!  
"那你想要什么？"她到底还做不做饭了？该死！她又来了！她再次用转移注意力的方式逃避了事情！

"How about the normal? Ramen sounds pretty good to me," there we go… I like that.  
"来点正常的怎么样？拉面听起来不错，"就这样吧……我喜欢这样。

"Sure, I'll start in a couple hours, it's still early," she lays her head on my shoulder as we watch TV. After awhile of staring into the 'stupid box' as Asuka occasionally called it, I got bored, so I opened my big mouth, "Asuka? I know that it doesn't matter, but today you seemed very… open with out relationship. I mean, everyone already knows, but you let me hold your hand up until we got into the classroom, you kissed me in front of Misato, and you kissed me in front of the whole class, any reason why you had a change of attitude towards it?"  
"当然，我过几个小时再开始，现在还早呢，" 她把头靠在我的肩膀上，我们一起看着电视。盯着这个'傻盒子'看了一会儿（偶尔阿斯卡会这么称呼它），我感到无聊，于是我张开了大嘴，"阿斯卡？我知道这无关紧要，但今天你似乎对我们关系非常……开放。我是说，大家已经都知道了，但你让我一直握着你的手直到我们进入教室，你在美里面前吻了我，还在全班面前吻了我，有什么原因让你改变了态度吗？"

"Well, I guess it was because of the whole 'I love you' thing. I mean, now that we admitted it, I think I'm more comfortable about it," I knew it!  
"嗯，我想是因为那句'我爱你'的事情。我是说，既然我们已经承认了，我觉得我对此更自在了，" 我就知道！"

"I'm glad you're okay with it now… you know, I think that you wanted to say it a long time ago…" she tenses up a bit.  
"我很高兴你现在对此没问题了……你知道吗，我觉得你很久以前就想说这句话了……" 她稍微紧张了一下。"

"Why would you say that?"  
"你为什么会这么说？"

"The night of our first date, you tried to say it, but stopped. I knew you did, I just never brought it up… am I right?"  
"在我们第一次约会的那个晚上，你试图说出来，但又停住了。我知道你有这个念头，只是从未提起过……我说的对吗？"

"Um… yeah… I did try to, but I… I kinda chickened out…" Asuka? Chickening out? That's rare! "Looks like you're the braver of us, huh?" she leaned up and kissed my cheek.  
"嗯……是的……我确实尝试过，但我……我有点退缩了……" 明日香？退缩？这可不常见！ "看来你比我们更勇敢，是吧？" 她凑上前，亲吻了我的脸颊。

"Yeah right, like I'll ever be braver than you. There's more of a chance of Toji getting back together with Hikari!" she chuckles.  
“是啊，说得好像我会有比你更勇敢的一天似的。东治和光复合的可能性都比这大！”她轻声笑道。

"You're the only person that has ever been able to make me laugh, did you know that? No one has ever been able to make me happy enough to actually laugh until I met you," was that true? I was the only person that made her happy? That was actually depressing and joyful to me. On one hand, it made me feel special to her. I really meant something to her, I brought her happiness. But on the other hand, the fact that I was the only person able to make her happy meant that I always had to be there. No, I don't plan on leaving any time soon, but what would happen if I HAD to leave? Knowing Gendo, it could very possibly happen, so what then? What would become of her?  
"“你是唯一一个能让我笑出来的人，你知道吗？在我遇见你之前，没有人能让我开心到真正笑出来，”这是真的吗？我是唯一让她快乐的人？这既让我感到沮丧又高兴。一方面，这让我觉得对她来说很特别。我真的对她有意义，我带给她快乐。但另一方面，我是唯一能让她快乐的人，这意味着我必须一直在她身边。不，我没有计划很快离开，但如果我不得不离开呢？考虑到源堂的行事风格，这很有可能发生，那该怎么办？她会变成什么样？”

"Really? Well then, looks like I'll have to stick around, huh?" I wrap my arm around her and hold her closer to me. This may sound corny, but I really do believe that I'll never leave her; I really believe that we'll be living together for the rest of our lives… but that means… I'm thinking to far in to the future again, just enjoy the moment. Just enjoy what you have NOW, stop thinking of what you could have…  
"真的吗？那么看来我得留下来，是吧？" 我搂住她的肩膀，将她拉近我。这听起来可能有点老套，但我真的相信我不会离开她；我真的相信我们会一起度过余生……但这意味着……我又在想太远的事情了，享受当下吧。珍惜你现在拥有的，别再去想你可能得到的东西……

"I love you Shinji…" "我爱你，真嗣……"

"I love you too… and I always will…"  
"我也爱你……而且永远都会……"

A/N- Okay, truth time. I'm so used to writing that last line that I actually wrote 'and nothing will ever change that', but then I caught myself and changed it. I really gotta pay attention more… I completely forgot the genre of this chapter half way through because I stopped for a few hours, then went back to writing drama and romance in this fic. Sorry about that, but a little mushyness never killed anyone, right? So, now that Asuka and Shinji are moving in with Rei, what will happen? Will Asuka put up with Rei? Find out in the next chapter; When You Love Someone. And yes, I know it sounds like a romance, but there will be humor, that just fits that chapter the best. Keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记 - 好吧，说实话。我太习惯写那最后一行了，以至于我实际上写了“而没有什么能改变这一点”，但随后我及时纠正了自己并改了过来。我真的得多加注意……我完全忘记了这篇chapter的类型，中途停了几个小时，然后回去写这篇小说里的戏剧和浪漫情节。对此感到抱歉，但一点点甜蜜并不会伤害任何人，对吧？所以，现在 Asuka 和 Shinji 搬去和 Rei 一起住，会发生什么呢？Asuka 能忍受 Rei 吗？下一章chapter《当你爱上某人》揭晓答案。是的，我知道这听起来像是一部浪漫小说，但其中会有恰到好处的幽默，正是最适合chapter的。继续加油！

### Chapter 13: When You Love Someone

That Night – After Dinner  
那一夜 – 晚餐后

"Our last dinner together… I'm going to miss you two so much!" Misato takes us into another tight hug.  
“我们最后一次共进晚餐……我会非常想念你们俩的！”美里再次紧紧地拥抱了我们。

"Us… to… uhhhh…" I can't breathe damn it! Let go! She leans back and looks at us with a smile.  
"我们…去…呃…" 我喘不过气来了，该死！放开我！她后仰着，微笑着看着我们。

"I love you two…" that was a first! "Listen, you're welcome here anytime you want. I promise, no matter what's going on, you can come over and stay for awhile. Okay?" so basically we have a second home? Cool!  
"我爱你们两个…" 这可是头一回！"听着，你们随时欢迎来这里。我保证，不管发生什么，你们都可以过来住一段时间。好吗？" 所以我们有第二个家了？酷！

"Okay… thanks Misato… thanks for taking care of us this far. And you're right, you did raise us to an extent," my small speech brought a tear to her eye, "We love you too Misato, we're really going to miss being with you," Asuka elbows me in the ribs.  
"好的…谢谢你，美里…谢谢你一直以来的照顾。你说得对，你确实在某种程度上抚养了我们，" 我简短的发言让她眼眶湿润了，"我们也爱你，美里，我们会非常想念和你在一起的时光，" 明日香用胳膊肘捅了捅我。

"Quit being so dramatic, it's not like we'll never see her again. Plus, we should be happy for her! She's finally getting married!" Misato raises an eyebrow.  
"别这么戏剧化，又不是再也见不到她了。再说了，我们应该为她高兴！她终于要结婚了！" 美里挑了挑眉。

"What do you mean by 'finally'?" Asuka blushed and grabbed my wrist.  
"你说的'终于'是什么意思？" 明日香脸红了，抓住了我的手腕。

"Okay! Time for bed! I'm tried!" she guides me into my room and jets into hers. I heard Misato begin to laugh out in the living room at Asuka's cowardly behavior. Really, what did she think was going to happen? We're leaving tomorrow morning! After a few minutes of laying in the darkness, I hear a knocking at my door.  
"好了！该睡觉了！我累了！" 她把我领进我的房间，然后冲进她自己的房间。我听到美里在客厅里因为明日香的胆小行为而大笑。真的，她以为会发生什么？我们明天早上就要离开了！在黑暗中躺了几分钟后，我听到有人敲我的门。

"Shinji? Can I come in?" was that Misato? Why did she want to see me this late? Normally it's Asuka…  
"真嗣？我能进来吗？" 是美里吗？为什么她这么晚想见我？通常是明日香……

"Yeah, sure," she sneaks in and slowly closes the door.  
"嗯，当然可以，" 她悄悄溜进来，慢慢关上门。

"Listen… I need to talk with you… you're really the only person I trust enough to talk about this with… do you mind?" Misato wanted to talk with me? Not tease me? That's new…  
"听着……我需要和你谈谈……你真的是我唯一信任到可以谈这件事的人……你介意吗？" 美里想和我谈谈？不是逗我？这倒是新鲜……

"Sure, what do you need?" I sit up in bed and she sits down next to me.  
“当然，你需要什么？” 我坐起身来，她则坐在我旁边。

"I'm… worried about you two moving in with Rei… I know that you'll be fine, but Asuka… doesn't exactly get along with Rei. Do you think that she'll be okay? Truthfully?" she's not going to like the answer…  
“我……担心你们俩搬去和丽住……我知道你会没事的，但明日香……和丽相处得并不融洽。你觉得她会好吗？说实话？” 她不会喜欢这个答案的……

"Truthfully?" she nodded, "I think Asuka is going to tear Rei up at first, but they'll eventually get used to it. Looks like Rei is starting to fight back too! She'll be fine as long as she stands up to Asuka, don't worry about it," standing up to Asuka might be signing your own death certificate, but if you come out of it alive, she does respect you back.  
“说实话？” 她点点头，“我觉得明日香一开始会把丽撕碎，但他们最终会习惯的。看起来丽也开始反击了！只要她能坚持对抗明日香，就没事的，别担心，” 对抗明日香可能是在签自己的死亡证明，但如果你能活着挺过来，她确实会对你刮目相看。

"I hope so… okay, that's all I needed to know, thanks. I'll drive you two to Rei's tomorrow at eight, so be sure to get up," she walked out of the room and winked at me before she left, "By the way, nice one with Asuka…" she shut the door before I had a chance to respond. I was GOING to say 'I know', but she didn't give me that opportunity! I was actually looking forward to tomorrow. No, I wasn't too happy about having to move out, but the fact that this will be a new experience with friends helps a lot. After a few minutes, I drift to sleep with hopeful dreams of tomorrow.  
"希望如此……好吧，这就是我想知道的，谢谢。明天八点我会开车送你们俩去丽那里，所以记得起床。" 她走出房间，临走前对我眨了眨眼，"顺便说一句，和明日香那招不错……" 她关上门，没给我回应的机会。我本想说'我知道'，但她没给我这个机会！我其实很期待明天。不，搬出去我并不太高兴，但能和朋友一起经历新事物确实有很大帮助。几分钟后，我带着对明天的美好憧憬进入了梦乡。

Morning 早晨

"Come on Shinji, wake up," I wake up to Asuka at my bedside in her school uniform.  
"快点，真嗣，起床了。" 我醒来时，明日香穿着校服站在我床边。

"What are you doing? We're going to Rei's remember?" she smiles.  
"你在干什么？我们要去丽那里，记得吗？" 她微笑着。

"I know…" she licks her lips as she smiles, "But I wanted to show you something…" she reached up and began to unbutton her shirt. I simply sigh and roll back over and close my eyes.  
"我知道……" 她舔了舔嘴唇，微笑着说，"但我想要给你看些东西……" 她伸手开始解开衬衫的扣子。我只是叹了口气，翻身闭上了眼睛。

"Wake me up when I'm not dreaming, okay?"  
"等我不是在做梦的时候再叫醒我，好吗？"

"Damn it…" "该死……"

Real Morning 真实的清晨

"Shinji! Wake up already!" I open my eyes to see Asuka in a pair of jeans and a white t-shirt, "We were supposed to leave half an hour ago! Misato's in the car waiting right now!" she reached down and lifted up a bag, then threw it on my stomach, "I already packed for you, just get dressed," she walks out of the room. Did she just help AND hurt me at the same time? I get up out of bed and get dressed as fast as I could then walk out of the room holding my suitcase, "It's about time! Hurry up," I follow her out of the apartment one last time and get into Misato's car.  
"真嗣！快起床了！" 我睁开眼，看到明日香穿着牛仔裤和白色 T 恤站在那里，"我们半小时前就该出发了！美里已经在车里等着了！" 她弯腰提起一个包，扔到我肚子上，"我已经帮你打包好了，赶紧换衣服，" 她走出房间。她是同时帮我又伤了我吗？我从床上爬起来，尽可能快地穿上衣服，然后拿着行李箱走出房间，"终于起来了！快点，" 我跟着她最后一次走出公寓，坐进美里的车里。

"I told you not to sleep in!" Misato speeds off, "Now we're late! You know Shinji, you really should think about getting a loud alarm!"  
"我告诉过你别睡过头！" 美里加速离开，"现在我们迟到了！真嗣，你真的该考虑买个大嗓门的闹钟了！"

"I already do…" I look over at Asuka with a smile. She just narrows her eyes and glares at me, "Ahhh… you're going to hit me, huh?" I still had the smile on as she punched me in the arm, "Yep… I know you well enough…"  
"我已经知道了…" 我笑着看向明日香。她只是眯起眼睛瞪着我，"啊…你要打我，对吧？" 她一拳打在我手臂上时，我依然保持着笑容，"嗯…我对你够了解的…"

"Shut up!" I copy word for word in sync as she spoke, "Stop it! Shinji!" I busted out laughing.  
"闭嘴！" 我一字不差地同步模仿她的话，"别这样！真嗣！" 我忍不住大笑起来。

"Oh, ha, ha… smartass…" she playfully punched my arm this time.  
"哦，哈哈…自作聪明…" 这次她开玩笑地捶了一下我的手臂。

"Okay clones, we're here," she came to a screeching halt in front of Rei's apartment. She looked back at us and smiled, "Bye you two… I'll miss you. Try not to kill Rei, okay Asuka?" we get out of her car.  
"好了，克隆们，我们到了。" 她在丽公寓前猛地停下车。她回头对我们微笑，"再见，你们俩……我会想你们的。尽量别杀了丽，好吗，明日香？" 我们下了她的车。

"I'll try… but Rei can be such a bitch!" both me and Misato stare at her wide-eyed, "What?"  
"我会试试……但丽有时候真是个婊子！" 我和美里都瞪大了眼睛看着她，"怎么了？"

"You… just called her Rei…" I was the first to speak, and the first to be glared at.  
"你……刚刚直呼了她的名字……" 我是第一个开口的，也是第一个被瞪的。

"Yeah, shouldn't it be 'Wondergirl'?" the fact that Misato's voice was high and nasally on the last word didn't exactly help the glare either…  
"是啊，不应该是'奇迹女孩'吗？" 米莎托最后这个词的高亢鼻音，并没有让她的瞪视显得更有说服力……

"Just go!" Misato speeds off laughing her ass off, "Damn, like this wasn't bad enough…"  
"快走吧！" 米莎托大笑着扬长而去，"该死，这样还不够糟糕吗……"

"It'll be okay, I mean, how bad could it be?" I open the door into Rei's apartment and immediately hear music.  
"会没事的，我是说，能有多糟糕呢？" 我推开绫波的公寓门，立刻听到了音乐声。

"Liberate your mind, you mother fucker, you're so narrow-minded, so narrow-minded. Now liberate your mind. Now mother fucker, you will liberate your mind, this time," Rei had a stereo blasting to some metal band and she was lying back on the bed mouthing the words, "Bold mother fu-"  
"解放你的思想，你这个混蛋，你太狭隘了，太狭隘了。现在解放你的思想。现在混蛋，这次你要解放你的思想，" 丽正在用音响播放着某个金属乐队的音乐，她躺在床上，嘴型跟着歌词，"大胆的混——"

"TURN DOWN THE DAMN MUSIC!" we were both holding our ears with all of our force. Rei jetted her eyes over to us and quickly turned off the speakers.  
"把那该死的音乐关小点！" 我们俩都用力捂住耳朵。丽瞪了我们一眼，迅速关掉了扬声器。

"I am… sorry…" Rei looked at the ground and blushed deeply, "I… didn't know you would be coming… at this time…" our beds were already here, making the room look quite small. They were practically next to each other; I really doubt that this was going to turn out too good…  
"我……对不起……" 丽看着地面，脸红得厉害，"我……不知道你们会在这个时候来……" 我们的床已经搬进来了，让房间显得相当狭小。它们几乎紧挨在一起；我真怀疑这不会有什么好结果……

"Whatever… metal head…" Asuka drops her luggage on one of the beds, "Any idea where we can put our stuff?"  
"随便啦…金属头…" 明日香将行李扔在一张床上，"你知道我们东西该放哪儿吗？"

"I cleared my closet of all my clothes to make room for you and Ikari," she actually did that?  
"我把衣柜里的衣服全清空了，好给你和碇腾出空间，" 她真的这么做了？

"Rei, you didn't have to clear out your whole closet, I mean, where did you put your clothes?" that was actually really nice of her. I mean, we're guests in her home and she went out of her way to try and make us more welcome.  
"丽，你没必要把整个衣柜都清空啊，我是说，你的衣服放哪儿了？" 她这么做真是太贴心了。我是说，我们是她家的客人，她却费尽心思让我们感到更受欢迎。

"I simply put them in my dresser. I hope that the closet will provide enough room."  
"我只是把它们放在我的梳妆台里。希望衣柜能提供足够的空间。"

"Now why would you say that?" Asuka could not have possibly sounded ruder right now.  
"现在你为什么要这么说？" 绫波现在听起来不可能更粗鲁了。

"Because I have seen your… collection of clothes," it was pretty big. How big? Let's just say that she could completely dress Tokyo-3 with only her shirts…  
"因为我见过你的…衣服收藏，" 那相当庞大。有多大？这么说吧，她仅凭自己的衬衫就能完全装扮东京-3…

"Well excuse me if I like to look nice! What do you even have besides school uniforms?" yeah, I was going to have to talk to Asuka about this. Sure, it's funny for the first ten minutes, but after that it's just annoying.  
"哎呀，如果我喜欢打扮得漂亮点，你有什么意见吗？除了校服你还有什么？" 是啊，我得和明日香谈谈这事。当然，一开始的十分钟挺搞笑的，但之后就只剩烦人了。

"I do not desire or need any other clothes," before Asuka could shoot back, I cut in.  
"我并不渴望也不需要其他衣服，" 在明日香反击之前，我抢先说道。

"Asuka, why don't you go unpack? When you're done I'll unpack my stuff, okay?" with one final glare at Rei, she walked off and began to unpack her clothes. I walk over to Rei and keep my voice as low as possible.  
"明日香，你为什么不先去整理行李？等你弄好了我再整理我的，好吗？" 她最后瞪了丽一眼，便走开开始整理自己的衣物。我走到丽身边，尽量压低声音。

"Listen, Rei, I know that Asuka isn't the easiest person to get along with, but when she finally sees you as a friend, she stops acting like this. What you need to do is stand up to her, don't let her treat you like that. Do you understand what I'm getting at?" hopefully this will work!  
"听着，丽，我知道明日香不是最容易相处的人，但她一旦把你当朋友，就不会再这样了。你需要做的是勇敢面对她，别让她那样对待你。你明白我的意思吗？"希望这招能奏效！

"I do… so I should stand up to pilot Souryu?" I nod with a smile, "Okay… but… why don't you stand up to her?" ah crap!  
"我懂了……所以我应该勇敢面对惣流驾驶员？"我笑着点头，"好的……但是……你为什么不勇敢面对她呢？"啊，糟了！

"Um… that's a different story… you see, I'm the one that sacrifices in this relationship, and I don't mind that, but the downfall of that is that I really can't stand up to her…" did that just come out of my mouth? All I heard was 'blah, blah, blah'…  
"呃……那是另一回事……你看，在这段关系中，我是那个做出牺牲的人，我并不介意，但问题是，我真的无法勇敢面对她……"我刚才是不是说了这些？我只听到'blah, blah, blah'……

"Now that… I do not understand… but if you say it will help… I will 'stand up' to Souryu," why didn't I like the sound of that?  
"既然…我不明白…但如果你说这会有帮助…我会‘站出来’面对 Souryu，"为什么我听起来不太对劲？"

"What are you two talking about? Better not be trying to steal Shinji from me Wondergirl!" Rei walked over to Asuka and stared her in the eye, "Damn! Ever heard of personal space? Learn some social skills!"  
"你们俩在说什么？最好别是想从我这里抢走真嗣，Wondergirl！" 绫波走近明日香，直视她的眼睛，"该死！没听说过个人空间吗？学点社交技巧吧！"

"I would appreciate it if you would refrain from calling me 'Wondergirl' in the future. It is… quite irritating…" uh oh…  
"如果你们以后能不再叫我‘Wondergirl’，我会很感激的。这…相当烦人…" 哎呀…"

"I'll call you whatever the hell I want! How about Wonderslut, eh? I think that suits you better!"  
"我想怎么叫你就怎么叫你！比如叫你‘奇迹荡妇’怎么样？我觉得这更适合你！"

"And how, may I ask, would you know what a 'slut' looked like?" I really don't like where this is going…  
"请问，你怎么知道‘荡妇’长什么样？我真不喜欢这话题的走向……"

"I'm looking at one right now!"  
"我现在正看着一个呢！"

"So… are you gazing into a mirror?" holy… shit…  
"所以…你在照镜子吗？"天啊…我靠…"

"WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?!" Rei was met with a very, VERY hard slap, that of which my face has never seen… which is hard…  
"你刚才对我说了什么？！"丽被狠狠地扇了一巴掌，那种力度我从未在脸上体验过…真是够狠的…"

"Ouch…" Rei held her red cheek.  
"哎哟…"丽捂着红肿的脸颊。

"That should teach you right! Just because I have to live here doesn't mean I have to like you!" I… think I may have screwed up… "All you're good for is piloting, that's it! You contribute nothing to the real world! What do you do? Name one thing!" Rei kept silent and began to stare at the floor, "See! You can't even tell me one thing you've done! You don't have any kind of relationship with anyone, you don't go outside unless someone tells you to, and you don't open your mouth unless told to! Now that the angels are gone, you're just a waste of space!" I saw Rei make a fist at her side and her whole body tenses up.  
"那该给你个教训！就因为我得住在这儿，并不意味着我得喜欢你！" 我…觉得我可能搞砸了… "你除了驾驶 Eva，还有什么用？你对现实世界毫无贡献！你做了什么？说出一项来！" 丽保持沉默，开始盯着地板，"看吧！你连一件事情都说不出来！你没有和任何人建立关系，除非有人叫你，否则你不出门，除非有人让你说话，否则你不开口！现在天使们走了，你只是个占地方的废物！" 我看到丽在身侧握紧了拳头，整个身体都紧绷起来。

"I… disagree…" "我…不同意…"

"How so? What have you ever done aside from pilot an Eva?"  
"为什么？除了驾驶 Eva，你还做过什么？"

"I… have…" Rei went silent.  
"我…有…" 丽沉默了。

"You can't even make up a lie! You're pathetic!" without a word, Rei begins to walk to the door, "And where do you think you're going, bitch?"  
"你连个谎都不会编！真可悲！" 丽一言不发，开始向门口走去，"你以为你要去哪儿，婊子？"

"Out…" she closes the door with some force, but not quite a slam.  
"出去…" 她用力关上门，但并未猛烈地摔上。

"That… wasn't very nice, Asuka. Did you have to cut her down like that?" she averted her glare from the door to me… crap…  
"那…不太好吧，明日香。你非得那样打击她吗？" 她从门上移开怒视，转向我…糟糕…

"She called me slut! Are you taking her side with this?"  
"她叫我荡妇！你这是站在她那边吗？"

"You called her a slut first, she was just defending herself. The fact that you slapped her was completely uncalled for," she walked over to me and stared at me inches from my face, "Asuka, I'm sorry, but yes. I am taking her side with this one," I walk past her – away from her glare – and head for the door.  
"是你先叫她荡妇的，她只是在自卫。你扇她耳光完全是没道理的，" 她走到我面前，近得几乎贴着我的脸，"明日香，对不起，但没错。这次我站在她那边，" 我绕过她——避开她的目光——朝门口走去。

"Don't tell me you're following her!"  
"别告诉我你在跟踪她！"

"You may not think so, but she does have friends," unlike Rei, I DO slam the door. Almost immediately when I walk outside I see a large dent in the wall… did Rei… no, couldn't be… could it?  
"你可能不这么认为，但她确实有朋友，""不像丽，我确实用力关上了门。我一走到外面，就看到墙上有一个大凹痕……是丽吗……不，不可能……会是她吗？

"Dude! Did you see Ayanami? Holy crap!" Kensuke comes running up to me, camera in hand.  
""伙计！你看到绫波了吗？天哪！"" 剑介朝我跑来，手里拿着相机。

"No, what happened?" he held the camera in front of my face and played it to show Rei punching the wall with a serious look of anger in her eyes, "Wow…"  
"不，发生了什么？" 他把相机举到我面前，播放着丽愤怒地一拳打在墙上的画面，眼中满是怒火，"哇…"

"No kidding! You think she's okay? What happened to her?" I push him aside and walk down the street I saw her walk down in the video, "Fine! Just walk off like nothing! Whatever!" I ignore Kensuke's sarcastic remark and continue down the street. Damn it… Rei must be seriously pissed to do that. But who could blame her? Asuka went way too far with that one, she's never acted THAT badly before. After a few minutes of walking, I find myself in a park… an empty park.  
"可不是嘛！你觉得她还好吗？她怎么了？" 我推开他，沿着视频中她走过的街道走去，"好！就这样走开，当作什么都没发生！随你便！" 我无视了健介的讽刺，继续沿着街道走。该死…丽一定是气疯了才会那样做。但谁又能怪她呢？明日香这次做得太过分了，她以前从没这么过分过。走了几分钟后，我发现自己来到了一个公园…一个空无一人的公园。

"Damn…Rei? You here? Hello?" I walk under a tree and lean back, "Ugh… I swear, if Asuka doesn't learn to get along with her, I'm going to die…" suddenly, I feel something hit my head. I look up to see Rei up in the tree… about thirty feet up in the tree… how the hell?  
"该死…丽？你在吗？喂？" 我走到一棵树下，靠在树干上，"呃…我发誓，如果明日香不学会和她相处，我就要疯了…" 突然，我感觉有什么东西砸到了我的头。我抬头一看，发现丽在树上…大约三十英尺高的树上…怎么可能？

"But you love her, correct?" she stared out into space, not looking at anything unparticular.  
"但你爱她，对吧？" 她凝视着远方，目光并未聚焦于任何特定之物。

"Um… yeah… how'd you get up there?"  
"呃… 是的… 你怎么爬上去的？"

"I climbed…" "我爬上去的…"

"Oh… are you okay? I mean, you seemed pretty angry back there…" she looked down at me. From my position, it almost looked like she had glassy eyes.  
"“哦……你还好吗？我是说，你刚才看起来非常生气……”她低头看着我。从我的位置看，她的眼睛几乎像是含着泪光。”

"I am… hurt… if that's what you mean. Physically I'm unharmed… aside from my face…" she touched her still red cheek, "Did I… do something wrong? Did I 'stand up' to her incorrectly?" she jumped down with ease and looked at me… she was close to crying…  
"“我……受伤了……如果你是指这个的话。身体上我没事……除了我的脸……”她轻触着依旧红肿的脸颊，“我……做错什么了吗？我‘站出来’的方式不对吗？”她轻松地跳了下来，看着我……她快要哭了……”

"Rei, I'm sorry, that was all my fault. I shouldn't have told you to do that," I kinda knew that something was going to happen, but nothing that bad!  
"“丽，对不起，这都是我的错。我不该让你那么做的，”我多少知道会发生些什么，但没想到会这么严重！”

"I'm still the one that said that… but… I believe that my punishment was… harsh…" punishment?  
"我还是那个说这话的人……但是……我觉得我的惩罚……有点重了……" 惩罚？

"Whoa! That wasn't a punishment! She just lost her temper! You really didn't do anything wrong," aside from calling my girlfriend a slut, nah, you didn't do anything.  
"哇！那不算惩罚！她只是发脾气了！你真的没做错什么，"除了叫我女朋友婊子，不，你什么都没做。"

"So… she was wrong?" "那么……是她错了吗？"

"Um… well, don't tell her I said this, but yeah, she was. She had no right to hit you," that's never stopped her from hitting me, Toji, Kensuke, and any guy that looked below her neck…  
"“呃…好吧，别告诉她我说了这话，但确实，她不该打你。”她打我、东治、真嗣，还有任何她觉得不如她的男生，这从来没停过…”

"I… do not want that to happen again…" well damn! Who could blame her?  
"“我…不想再发生这种事了…”该死！谁会怪她呢？”

"Don't worry about it, I'll make sure it doesn't, okay?" and how exactly do you propose to do that? Jump in front of the hand? I'd rather take a bullet!  
"“别担心，我会确保不会再发生，好吗？”你打算怎么做？挡在拳头前？我宁愿挨一枪！”

"Okay… may I go home now?"  
"好吧……我现在可以回家了吗？"

"Sure, I'll walk with you," as we begin to walk back to her apartment, I realize something… I just ran out on Asuka for Rei… ah crap! I'm so screwed! Sure, I was open about taking Rei's side, but to actually LEAVE… I'm going to have to beg for my life! When we finally get to her apartment, my heart was pounding thinking of what is going to happen to me. She opens the door to show Asuka putting away my things… good sign… I think…  
"当然，我陪你一起走，" 当我们开始走回她的公寓时，我意识到一件事……我刚刚为了丽抛下了明日香……啊糟糕！我完蛋了！虽然我坦白过站在丽这边，但实际离开……我得求她饶命了！当我们终于到达她的公寓时，我的心怦怦直跳，想着即将发生的事。她打开门，看到明日香正在收拾我的东西……这是个好兆头……我想……

"Oh… hey…" she took one look at Rei and darted her eyes to the floor.  
"哦……嗨……" 她看了一眼丽，然后迅速将目光移向地板。

"Hello…" "你好…"

"Listen… I'm… sorry about before… I shouldn't have hit you…" was this coming from Asuka? "And… I'm sorry for the whole slut thing…"  
"听着…我…之前的事很抱歉…我不该打你的…" 这话居然出自明日香之口？"还有…对于那次说你是荡妇的事，我也道歉…"

"Whole? I only recall one ti-" Asuka rolled her eyes.  
"整个？我只记得一次——" 明日香翻了个白眼。

"Not that… ugh… look, can we just forget about what happened?" I'm still not too sure, but I think I saw Rei break a small smile after Asuka said that.  
"不是那个…呃…听着，我们能不能就当刚才的事没发生过？" 我还是不太确定，但我觉得在明日香说完后，丽似乎露出了一个淡淡的微笑。

"Forget about what?" I kinda liked Rei's new personality! But I still can't help but wonder what brought it on.  
"忘记什么？" 我有点喜欢丽的新性格！但我还是忍不住想知道是什么引发了这种变化。

"There ya go, you're catching on Rei!" Asuka did it again! Even Rei jumped a little at it! "And before you say anything, I'll stop calling you Wondergirl…" who was she doing this for? I doubt Asuka would do this on her own free will.  
"这就对了，丽，你开始明白了！" 明日香又来了！连丽都被吓了一跳！ "在你开口之前，我会停止叫你奇迹女孩…" 她这么做是为了谁？我怀疑明日香不会自愿这样做。

"Thank… you…" that was the first time I've seen Rei surprised! Eyes wide and everything!  
“谢…谢谢…”这可是我第一次看到丽这么惊讶！眼睛都瞪大了！

"Okay, now that we're done with all the mushy crap, I wanted to do something," she walked over to Rei and grabbed her wrist, "Come on, we're going to the mall. You need a real wardrobe!" she grabs my wrist as well as she walks out, "And we need you to carry it!" and pay…  
“好了，既然那些肉麻的东西都结束了，我有件事想做，”她走到丽身边，抓住她的手腕，“走吧，我们去商场。你需要真正的衣橱！”她一边走一边也抓住了我的手腕，“还有，你得负责拿东西！”还有付钱…

A/N- Damn… sorry for the crappy chapter, not exactly writing to well today. Probably from all the damn writing I'm doing at school… bastards… okay! So, Asuka seems to have warmed up to Rei quite a bit, why do you think? Oh, and if you don't get the title for this chapter, you missed the unwritten fact. If you don't know, it'll be brought up in the next chapter. Find out what happens at the mall in the next chapter; Kids, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记- 该死…抱歉，这章写得有点烂，今天实在写得不怎么样。可能是因为在学校写得太多了…混蛋…好吧！所以，明日香似乎对丽亲近了不少，你们觉得为什么呢？哦，如果你没看懂这章的标题，那你就错过了一些未明说的细节。如果你不知道，下一章会提到。想知道在商场发生了什么，请看下一章；孩子们，在那之前，继续加油吧！

### Chapter 14: Kids
A/N – Okay, the old chapters are gone, and here are the new ones. Don't expect this chapter to be long at all because of the cut-out.  
作者注 – 好吧，旧章节已经删除，这里是新章节。不要期待这个chapter会很长，因为内容有所删减。

"Sure, I'll walk with you," as we begin to walk back to her apartment, I realize something… I just ran out on Asuka for Rei… ah crap! I'm so screwed! Sure, I was open about taking Rei's side, but to actually LEAVE… I'm going to have to beg for my life!

"Thank… you…" that was the first time I've seen Rei surprised! Eyes wide and everything! Where's my camera?!  
"谢…谢谢…" 那是我第一次看到丽惊呆了！眼睛睁得大大的！我的相机呢？！

"Eh, don't worry about it… and what's up with you two? You act like you've just seen a ghost!"  
"哎，别在意… 你们俩怎么了？表现得像刚见了鬼似的！"

"No ghost… just the apocalypse…" OKAY! Time for a topic change before Rei gets shot!  
"不是鬼… 只是世界末日…" 好了！趁丽还没开枪，换个话题吧！

"SO, since we have the whole day off, why don't we head out to the lake? We don't get too much time to ourselves anymore, we should at least relax for one day," oh yeah, that's right, I'm good! I should totally make my own show, dealing with screwed up families! Hm…  
"所以，既然我们今天全天休息，不如去湖边走走？我们现在已经很少有自己的时间了，至少应该放松一天，"哦对了，没错，我挺行的！我完全可以自己做一个节目，探讨那些问题家庭！嗯……

Dr. Ikari 碇医生

"Well, we're back from our commercial break. While you were away, I met a small family of three; this young man's name is Dani, and his parents are Michelle and Mike. They traveled all the way here from America because our viewers like the foreign people! Apparently, Michelle and Mike have been having some marital problems-"  
"好的，我们回来了，广告时间结束了。在你们离开的时候，我遇到了一个小家庭，三口之家；这位年轻人的名字是丹尼，他的父母是米歇尔和迈克。他们从美国远道而来，因为我们的观众喜欢外国人！据说，米歇尔和迈克之间有些婚姻问题……"

"How can I not?! This crazy bitch is… crazy!She smells like an old man that just soiled himself, she looks like Big Bird on crack, her voice is like cats running across a chalkboard… she even looks sticky! For the love of God, I can TASTE the air around her! It's like bacon gone bad! She's pretty much pretty much offensive to all senses!" the crowd roars with hundreds of 'OOOO!'s.  
"我怎么能不生气？！这个疯女人真是……疯了！她闻起来像刚弄脏自己的老头，看起来像嗑药的巨鸟，声音刺耳得像猫在黑板上奔跑……她甚至看起来黏糊糊的！看在上帝的份上，我都能尝到她周围的空气！就像变质的培根！她简直是全方位地冒犯感官！" 人群中爆发出数百声'哦哦哦'的呼喊。

"Yeah? Well at least I don't mow the lawn in my underwear!"  
"是吗？至少我不会穿着内裤修剪草坪！"

"Okay, I'm sensing some hostility in-" I was cut off by the son.  
"好吧，我感觉到一些敌意在——" 我被儿子打断了。

"Nah, this is actually a good day for them. Last week they got into a fight and my mom cut off his… yeah… and fed it to a squirrel." A boxing bell rings and the two parents start fist fighting.  
"不，今天对他们来说其实挺好的。上周他们吵了一架，我妈把他……嗯……给切了，还喂给松鼠吃了。" 一声拳击铃响起，两位家长开始拳打脚踢。

"SHINJI! SHINJI! SHINJI!"  
"真嗣！真嗣！真嗣！"

Back In Reality 回到现实

"Helllooooo?! Shinji? You with us?" Asuka snaps her fingers in front of my face, snapping me out of my mini-day dream.  
"喂——？！真嗣？你在听吗？" 明日香在我面前弹了弹手指，把我从短暂的遐想中拉了回来。

"I'd call it Jerry Springer… not too sure why…"  
"我觉得这更像《杰瑞·斯普林格秀》……虽然不知道为什么……"

A/N – Sorry, I just had to point this out: Jerry Springer is actually in my computer's dictionary! 'A reality-based TV show on basic cable where fighting and humiliation is encouraged' Man, the US is going to hell…  
作者注 – 抱歉，我不得不指出这一点：《杰瑞·斯普林格秀》居然在我的电脑词典里！'一档基于现实的电视节目，基本有线频道，鼓励争吵和羞辱' 天哪，美国这是要完蛋了……

"O… kay… anyway, your idea about going to the lake seems pretty nice, even if you only brought it up so you could see me in my two-piece," and that's when it occurred to me – I don't even own a pair of swimming shorts… my God I need help… Asuka talks about being in a two-piece and that comes to mind… "Hey Rei, do you even own a bathing suit aside from your one at school?" maybe this wasn't such a good idea… I'm sure I'm going to get yelled at for even making eye-contact with Rei!  
"呃…好吧…总之，你提议去湖边的主意听起来不错，即使你只是为了看我穿比基尼才提出来的，"就在这时我突然意识到——我连一条泳裤都没有…天哪，我需要帮助…明日香提到穿比基尼，我就想到这个… "嘿，绫波，除了学校的那套，你还有泳装吗？"也许这个主意并不太好…我敢肯定，光是和绫波对视都会被骂！

"Yes, of course," you know, with time, Rei might actually have a passable personality.  
"是的，当然，"你知道吗，随着时间的推移，绫波的性格可能会变得可以接受。

"Okay, Shinji, you grab some towels and a few sodas while we get changed. I know for a fact you don't own swimming trunks, so just go in shorts or something," people are going to start calling us a married couple, I can just feel it in my bones.  
"好的，真嗣，你去拿些毛巾和几瓶汽水，我们换衣服。我知道你肯定没有泳裤，就穿短裤什么的吧，"人们会开始把我们当成夫妻的，我骨子里都能感觉到。

"No problem, but lets try and hurry so we can get there before school lets out," before I even finished the sentence the two women were out of the room, "Shinji being ignored today for the three-hundred and eleventh time today… that's a new record!"  
"没问题，但我们得快点，这样我们才能在学校放学前赶到，"我还没说完这句话，两位女士就已经离开了房间，"今天被无视了三百一十一次的碇君……这可是个新纪录！"

---

Ten Minutes Later 十分钟后

"You really don't trust me at all, do you?" Rei locks the door behind us as we walk out of the apartment.  
"你真的完全不信任我，对吧？"我们走出公寓时，绫波锁上了门。"

"Of course I do, but I also know how a guy's mind works. You walk next to me, and if you drift behind on 'accident', expect consequences," Asuka was so paranoid that I'd be sneaking peeks at Rei that she made her wear a baggy shirt until we get to the lake.  
“我当然知道，但我更懂男人的心思。你走在我旁边，要是‘不小心’落后了，后果自负，”明日香对我偷瞄绫波的疑心重到让她穿上宽松衬衫，直到我们抵达湖边。

Instead of taking a cab like we normally do, we decided to just walk this time. It's a pretty calm day; not a cloud in the sky, the omnipresent haze that seemed to drift over Tokyo-3, constantly staring down at us like an eagle searching for prey has gone elsewhere, and above all, not a single person was on the streets. Men and women were still working at their job – whether they like it or not – kids are still in school… it's actually pretty nice. I've never seen the city so peaceful… hell, I've never even seen it calm, let alone peaceful. It could be that we just never get a chance to relax anymore, so we fail to miss the simple things in life that we all take for granted.  
这次我们没有像往常一样打车，而是决定步行。今天天气相当宜人；万里无云，那似乎永远笼罩在东京-3 上空的薄雾，像鹰寻觅猎物般俯视我们的景象已不见踪影，最重要的是，街道上空无一人。男男女女仍在工作——无论他们是否喜欢——孩子们还在学校……其实挺不错的。我从未见过这座城市如此宁静……见鬼，我甚至从未见过它平静过，更别提宁静了。可能只是我们再也没有机会放松了，所以我们忽略了生活中那些理所当然的简单美好。

The lake was about a half an hour walk, and in that time our small group drifted through many different topics of conversation, and for once, Rei was involved in it. In fact, she imputed more then I did at times. When we were about ten minutes from the lake, Asuka took my right hand as we were walking and put it around her waist, and copied the action with her own, then whispered in my ear, "Show some PA every now and then, don't be so nervous all the time," she did have a point there. We never really showed any public affection, which was stupid because everyone knew we were dating. We traveled like this for quite awhile, even after we got to the lake and Rei went to go change into her swim suit, we stood at the shore of the lake staring out at the glassy finish in silence… that is until we heard what sounded like a grenade in water.  
湖大约需要半小时的步行路程，在这段时间里，我们的小团体漫谈了许多不同的话题，而这次，丽也参与其中。事实上，她有时比我还积极。当我们离湖还有十分钟路程时，明日香牵起我的右手，环在她的腰间，自己也照做，然后在我耳边低语：“偶尔也要展现点公开亲昵，别总是那么紧张。”她这话不无道理。我们从未真正在公共场合表现过亲昵，这很愚蠢，因为所有人都知道我们在交往。我们就这样走了很久，甚至在到达湖边、丽去换泳装后，我们仍站在湖岸边，默默凝视着平静如镜的水面……直到我们听到了类似水下爆炸的声音。

"Damnit!" “该死！”

"What did I tell you brother? You can make explosives like that!" explosives? What the hell?  
“我怎么跟你说的，兄弟？你能制造那种爆炸物！”爆炸物？搞什么鬼？

"Ah shaddup! I'm just trying to get us back!" me and Asuka looked to our right to see a short boy with blonde hair in a red trench coat at the shore with a blue horn sticking up from the water… okay, either this guy is a flasher or a psychopath.  
“闭嘴！我只是在想办法让我们回去！”我和明日香向右边看去，只见一个穿着红色风衣的金发矮个男孩站在岸边，水里还冒出一个蓝色的角……好吧，这家伙要么是个暴露狂，要么是个疯子。

"Um… do you need help?" of course, me and my big mouth just had to comment, at which point Asuka glared at me.  
“呃…需要帮忙吗？”当然，我这张大嘴巴就是忍不住要插话，结果明日香瞪了我一眼。

"Oh… hey, sorry about that, we're just having some trouble. Can you tell us where South is?" yeah, just turn around for a second while I pull a compass out of my ass!  
“哦…嘿，抱歉，我们有点麻烦。你能告诉我们南边在哪儿吗？”是啊，转过身去一秒钟，我就能从屁股里掏出一个指南针来！

"No, sorry… um… 'we're'? You have a friend around here somewhere?" the blue horn sticking up above the water began to grow, showing a man in a large suit of armor, "Oh… yeah, that makes a lot of sense right there…"  
"不，抱歉……呃……'我们'？你在这附近有朋友吗？" 水面上的蓝色尖角开始变大，显现出一个身着巨大盔甲的男人，"哦……是啊，这么说很有道理……"

"Holy crap! You're huge! Are you his dad or something?" at this the blue suit of armor let out what sounded like a young child's voice.  
"我的天哪！你真大！你是他爸爸还是什么？" 听到这话，蓝色盔甲发出听起来像小孩的声音。

"Actually, I'm his little brother," and of course, Asuka busts out laughing.  
"实际上，我是他弟弟，" 当然，明日香忍不住大笑起来。

"But he's so tiny! What are you, five foot two?! On top of that the soles of your shoes are like, three inches thick!" yeah, apparently the kid doesn't like to be called short.  
"但他这么小！你多高，五英尺二英寸吗？！而且你的鞋底足足有三英寸厚！" 是啊，显然这孩子不喜欢被叫矮。

"WHO YOU CALLIN' SHORT!? You're girlfriends got a problem buddy!" at this, he began running at us, and his 'little brother' grabbed his wrist.  
"谁说你矮了？！你女朋友有意见是吧，伙计！" 说着，他开始向我们冲过来，而他那'小弟弟'抓住了他的手腕。

"Sorry, you'll have to excuse my brother, he's a LITTLE SHORT tempered," okay that was a good one, I have to admit! "Come on, calm down, she didn't mean it, right?" at this point, it seemed like the man under the armor was winking, but I really couldn't tell. Surprisingly, Asuka didn't even get mad, she just continued laughing.  
"抱歉，你得原谅我弟弟，他有点容易发火，" 好吧，这一句挺妙的，我得承认！"来吧，冷静点，她不是那个意思，对吧？" 这时，那个穿着盔甲的男人似乎在眨眼，但我真的看不清楚。出乎意料的是，明日香甚至没有生气，只是继续笑着。

---

Five Minutes And Much Yelling Later  
五分钟后，吵闹声一片

"So, how'd you two get here?" we were all sitting at the shore, talking calmly.  
"那么，你们俩是怎么来到这里的？" 我们坐在岸边，平静地交谈着。

"Not too sure about that one, but I'm pretty sure I screwed up on my last transmutation…" okay, I don't know what that is exactly, but seeing this kid tells me that I'd rather not know… "Oh, by the way, my name's Ed and my brother here's Al."  
"不太确定那个，但我很确定我在最后一次炼金术实验中搞砸了……" 好吧，我不太清楚那具体是什么，但看到这孩子让我觉得还是不知道为好…… "哦，对了，我叫爱德，这是我弟弟阿尔。"

"So, you got family around here or something?" for some reason, with names like Ed and Al, I doubt they even live in this continent, but hey, she's entitled to her questions.  
"那么，你在这附近有家人什么的吗？" 出于某种原因，像艾德和艾尔这样的名字，我怀疑他们甚至不住在这个大陆上，但嘿，她有权问这些问题。

"No, like I said, we're here on accident, you?"  
"不，就像我说的，我们是意外来到这里的，你呢？"

"Well, my dad's the commander of NERV, but he's kind of an ass, so he doesn't count," everyone that knew him – aside from Rei of course – laughed at this.  
"嗯，我爸爸是 NERV 的指挥官，但他有点混蛋，所以不算数，" 所有认识他的人——当然除了丽以外——听到这里都笑了。

"Oh really?" the guy in blue obviously had no idea what NERV was… I wasn't about to explain it either, "Our dad is an immortal and our mom is a puss spewing, organ pile, sin against god," okay, these guys are DEFINATLY freaks! Am I the only one that's creeped out here?! Well, one thing led to another, and it ended up with me and Ed getting into a fight about who's got the harder life… good lord I need help…  
"哦，真的吗？" 那个穿蓝衣服的家伙显然不知道 NERV 是什么……我也不打算解释，"我们的爸爸是不朽的，而我们的妈妈是个喷着脓液、器官堆积的罪孽之身，"好吧，这些人绝对是怪胎！难道只有我一个人觉得这里很诡异吗？！好吧，一件事情引出了另一件，结果我和艾德为了谁的生活更艰难而打了起来……天哪，我需要帮助……

"Yeah? Well I was killed twice in one day!"  
"是吗？我可是在一天之内死了两次！"

"That's nothing! Ever had Asuka mad at you? THAT fucking kills!" I hear her laugh, but I paid no attention to it, "Why don't you just give it up?"  
"那算什么！你试过被明日香生气吗？那才真他妈要命！" 我听到她的笑声，但我没在意，"你为什么不干脆放弃呢？"

"Why don't you shut the hell up and I kick your ass? Equivalent exchange bitch!" well, one thing lead to another, and Ed said something about 'Having tea with scar is easier then this', and stormed off with his brother.  
“你他妈怎么不闭嘴，我揍你一顿？等价交换，贱人！”好吧，事情一件接一件，爱德说了一句‘和斯卡喝茶都比这容易’，然后就带着弟弟气冲冲地走了。

"Okay, what just happened here?"  
“好吧，这里刚刚发生了什么？”

"I believe that we just encountered a crossover…"  
“我想我们刚刚遇到了一次跨界……”

"You mean like that TV show with that fake-ass guy that talks to ghosts?" while the two girls laugh, I fall back onto the grass and TRY to relax. Man, that kid was such an ass! "You really need to calm down Shinji, don't let it get to you. Listen, why don't we go for a little swim to relax like we planned on doing in the first place?" she poked the side of my head with her forefinger, "I'll race ya."  
"你是说那种和假模假样的家伙一起跟鬼魂对话的电视节目？" 两个女孩笑了起来，我则向后倒在草地上，试图放松。天哪，那小子真是个混蛋！"真嗣，你真的需要冷静下来，别让它影响你。听着，我们为什么不按原计划去游个泳放松一下呢？" 她用食指戳了戳我的头，"我跟你比赛。"

A/N – Okay, I know that there wasn't much of a chapter after my change, but I'm just going to get this posted. Sorry about that, but I couldn't stand that anymore. Anyway, next chapter's gonna be all about R and R (I think), but I have a lot planned. So… yeah… read the next chapter; Killer Queen, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者注 – 好吧，我知道我的改变之后没有太多chapter，但我只是想把这个发出来。对此感到抱歉，但我实在受不了了。无论如何，下一章chapter将会是关于放松和休息的（我想），但我有很多计划。所以…是的…阅读下一章chapter；杀手女王，在此之前，继续保持吧！

A/A/N – Parietals, frontal, occipital, temporals, mandible, maxilla, nasal, inferior concha, middle concha, vomer, zygomatic, hyoid, carpals, tarsals, ulna, radius, sternum… my god I hate bones… my semester exams are over and after all the studying, I no longer see humans, I see a skeleton with the names of the bones on it… help? If you're reading this and knew where all those bones were, you are suffering from post-dramatic anatomy syndrome, much like I am.  
作者/作者/注 – 顶骨、额骨、枕骨、颞骨、下颌骨、上颌骨、鼻骨、下鼻甲、中鼻甲、犁骨、颧骨、舌骨、腕骨、跗骨、尺骨、桡骨、胸骨…我的天，我讨厌骨头…我的学期考试结束了，经过所有的学习，我现在看人不再看到人，而是看到一具骨架，上面标着骨头名称…救命？如果你在读这个并且知道所有这些骨头的位置，那你和我一样，患上了创伤后解剖学综合症。

### Chapter 15: Killer Queen

A/N – Yes, Queen rocks, and if you disagree you know nothing.  
A/N – 没错，皇后乐队很棒，如果你不同意，那说明你一无所知。

"So, what does the winner get?" by now, we have set up all the rules, Rei was the judge, and now we're just setting the stakes. I have to admit, I think I might actually have a chance in this, I'm a pretty good swimmer and… actually, I have no idea whether Asuka is or not.  
“那么，赢家能得到什么？”现在我们已经制定好了所有规则，丽是裁判，现在我们只是在设定赌注。我得承认，我觉得我在这场比赛中可能真的有机会，我是个相当不错的游泳选手，而且……实际上，我并不知道明日香是否擅长游泳。

"Hm… okay, if I win, you do my homework for a week, and if you win… I dunno, you choose," of course, being my age, a few things came to mind, but nothing realistic, or that is going to happen any time soon.  
"嗯…好吧，如果我赢了，你帮我做一周作业，如果你赢了…我也不清楚，你来选吧，"当然，以我的年纪，脑海中闪过几个念头，但都不切实际，或者近期内不可能发生。

"If I win…" and idea eventually comes to mind, and I whisper it in Asuka's ear, to avoid Rei from hearing it. Asuka lets out a small laugh and look up at Rei from the water.  
"如果我赢了…"一个主意最终浮现脑海，我凑近明日香耳边低语，以防丽听到。明日香轻笑一声，从水中抬头看向丽。

"Okay, seems fair enough, she could use it," Rei, keeping her usual face, raised a single eyebrow, "GO!" out of nowhere, Asuka jets off, splashing water in my face as she violently kicks away… you know, even if I lose, big deal. We have the same classes; I'll just give her my homework to copy!  
"好吧，看起来挺公平的，她确实需要这个，"丽保持着一贯的表情，微微挑起一边眉毛，"开始！"突然间，明日香猛地冲了出去，水花溅了我一脸，她激烈地踢水前进…你知道吗，就算我输了，也没什么大不了的。我们上同样的课；我直接把作业给她抄就行了！

"Hey!" with a wide smile, I go after her, and soon catch up. We were going out to the buoy – which was the middle marker of the lake – and back. Needless to say, this was quite a long ways and later on that night both of us would be regretting doing it. Up until the buoy, I was about five feet behind her, but when we finally got to the half-way mark, I see her using the floating chunk of metal for support just to stay afloat, "You okay Asuka?" I swim up next to her heavily panting body.  
"嘿！" 我带着灿烂的笑容追了上去，很快就赶上了她。我们正要去湖中的浮标——那是湖中央的标志——然后再返回。不用说，这段距离相当长，那天晚上我们俩都会后悔做了这件事。直到浮标前，我大约落后她五英尺，但当我们终于到达半程标记时，我看到她正利用那块漂浮的金属块来支撑自己，以保持漂浮，"你还好吗，明日香？" 我游到她身边，她的身体沉重地喘息着。

"Yeah… I'm fine… I don't know why… but I got really tired a little ways back… just give me a second…" I put my arm around her shoulders, trying to relax her.  
"嗯…我没事…我不知道为什么…但我在回来的路上真的累坏了…就给我一会儿…" 我把手臂搭在她的肩膀上，试图让她放松。

"You need help getting back to shore?" she slowly nodded before closing her eyes.  
"你需要帮忙回到岸边吗？" 她缓缓点头，然后闭上了眼睛。

"No… just give me… a second…" her legs stopped kicking and she instantly sank under the surface. Acting out of pure instinct, I dive underneath and grab her, trying to get her head above the surface. Okay, this is seriously bad, I don't think I can get us both back to shore on my own… not like I have much of a choice.  
“不…就给我…一点时间…”她的腿停止了踢动，随即整个人沉入水面。出于纯粹的本能，我潜入水下抓住她，试图让她头部露出水面。好吧，这真的很糟糕，我不认为我能独自把我们俩都带回岸边…尽管我别无选择。

"Come on Asuka…" after a couple minutes of adjusting her limp body onto my back so I was able to swim with the least amount of output energy, I begin to slowly make my way back to where Rei was standing. I think she saw what was going on from where she was, because halfway back to shore she began to swim out towards us and met me fairly quickly. Without a word, she takes Asuka's left shoulder – I have her right – and we paddle towards shore.  
“加油，明日香…”在将她瘫软的身体调整到我背上以便用最少的能量游泳几分钟后，我开始缓慢地向丽所在的地方游去。我想她从她所在的位置看到了发生的事情，因为当我们游回岸边一半时，她开始向我们游来，很快就遇到了我。她一言不发，接过明日香的左肩——我扶着她的右肩——我们一起向岸边划去。

"She was bitten by a water snake," I didn't bother to ask how she knew that, but for some reason I trusted her comment. When we finally got to dry land, we laid Asuka on her back on the sand. Her lips were a deep blue on her loosely open jaw, and her entire body was pale. I could see two small pricks of blood on her ankle, obviously a snake bite, "Get the salt you packed with our lunches and bring a cup," trying to walk as fast as I could, which wasn't fast at all by the way, I get the items that Rei demanded. Without a word – or any noticeable emotions – she mixed the salt and water and slowly poured it on the two stab wounds, "This should negate the venom, Commander Ikari did this to me last time I was swimming here a few years ago," Asuka winces slightly from the sodium irritating her wound and eventually sat up, looking slightly better.  
"她被水蛇咬了，" 我懒得问她是怎么知道的，但不知为何我相信她的话。当我们终于到达干燥的陆地时，我们让明日香平躺在沙滩上。她的嘴唇在她微微张开的下巴上呈现出深蓝色，整个身体都很苍白。我可以看到她脚踝上有两个小血点，显然是被蛇咬的，"把你午餐时打包的盐和杯子拿来，"我尽量快步走，虽然实际上并不快，我拿到了丽要求的东西。她一言不发——也没有表现出任何明显的情绪——她把盐和水混合，慢慢地倒在两个刺伤处，"这应该能中和毒液，几年前我在这里游泳时，碇司令就是这样帮我处理的，"明日香因钠刺激伤口而微微皱眉，最终坐了起来，看起来好些了。

"What the hell just happened…?" she held her head in apparent pain or exhaustion.  
"刚刚到底发生了什么…？"她显然因疼痛或疲惫而抱着头。

"You were bitten by a snake when you were swimming, and Rei helped you," I put my arm around her shoulders and she leaned her head on mine.  
"你游泳时被蛇咬了，是丽帮了你，"我搂住她的肩膀，她把头靠在我的头上。

"Thanks Rei… that really sucked…" only Asuka would make a comment like that after being bitten by a damn snake! She stood up with shaking knees and grabbed a towel, "Okay, screw the water, let's just stay on the shore. Shinji, why don't you go grab our food?" without a word, I walk over the cooler we brought along. I can't believe that she's still willing to stay… she must be fine then, because even Asuka knows when enough is enough. As I was walking back with our tin-foil-wrapped sandwiches, I really couldn't help but stare at Asuka's face. Now back to her normal color, I notice just how beautiful she looks in this daylight. I don't know why I haven't noticed this before, but she really is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Our eyes meet, and she simply smiles at me with those amazing sky-blue eyes.  
"谢谢丽……真是糟糕透了……"只有明日香会在被该死的蛇咬了之后还这么说！她颤抖着双腿站起来，抓起一条毛巾，"好吧，别管水了，我们就在岸上待着。真嗣，你去拿我们的食物吧？"我一言不发地走向我们带来的冷却器。真不敢相信她还愿意留下来……那她一定没事了，因为连明日香也知道什么时候该适可而止。当我拿着用锡纸包好的三明治走回来时，我真的忍不住盯着明日香的脸看。现在恢复了正常的脸色，我注意到她在阳光下看起来多么美丽。我不知道为什么之前没注意到，但她真的是我见过的最美丽的女孩。我们的目光相遇，她只是用那双迷人的天蓝色眼睛对我微笑。

"You just gonna stare all day or are you coming?"  
"你打算一直盯着看还是过来？"

Same Place – 3:30 PM  
同一地点 – 下午 3:30

By now, Hikari, Toji (who were hand-in-hand the entire time), and Kensuke were with us. We called them up after school was let out, and surprisingly, all of them came. Kensuke was showing off his new stereo that held a ridiculous amount of songs – something like six-hundred gigabytes of music, and he has already filled it up completely. Hikari and Toji were subtly showing off their newly found relationship; holding hands, a few pecks on the lips, just small things. Rei was strutting her new personality, and me and Asuka… well, we were just enjoying the scenery.  
此时，光、冬二（他们一直手牵手）和真希波也加入了我们。放学后我们叫上了他们，出乎意料的是，他们都来了。真希波正在炫耀他那台能容纳大量歌曲的新音响——大约有六百吉字节的音乐容量，而且他已经完全填满了它。光和冬二则在不经意间展示他们新建立的关系；牵手、轻吻嘴唇，都是些小动作。丽在炫耀她的新个性，而我与明日香……嗯，我们只是在欣赏风景。

"So guys, you wanna try and stump me with music again?" we've been trying to find at least one song that Kensuke doesn't have on that seemingly bottomless pit, and so far, we're failing, "Oh! I know! This is a band from the UK called Cradle Of Filth, and this song was defiantly written for Asuka!" he presses play, and I just wait for him to die.  
“那么，伙计们，想再试试用音乐难倒我吗？”我们一直在寻找至少一首真希波那看似无底洞般的音响里没有的歌曲，但至今仍未成功，“哦！我知道了！这是一个来自英国的乐队，叫污秽摇篮，这首歌绝对是为明日香写的！”他按下播放键，而我只是等着看他出糗。

_She's just a devil woman  
她只是个恶魔般的女人  
With evil on her mind  
心中怀恶念  
Beware the devil woman 当心那恶女  
She's gonna get you 她会抓住你  
She's just a devil woman  
她只是个恶魔般的女子  
With evil on her mind  
心中满是邪恶  
Beware the devil woman 当心那恶魔般的女子  
She's gonna get you from behind  
她会从背后偷袭你_

Asuka just laughs at this… wait, she laughed?! Kensuke pretty much just called her a devil, and she's laughing? I think that snake venom is still in her… "You know Kensuke, I got a song for you to look up. How about White and Nerdy?" while Kensuke wasn't exactly 'white', that was still funny as hell! Kensuke turns a deep red before turning off the stereo.  
明日香对此只是笑了笑……等等，她笑了？！健介刚刚几乎是在说她像个恶魔，她居然在笑？我觉得那蛇毒还在她体内……“健介，你知道吗，我有一首歌推荐给你。‘白与书呆’怎么样？”虽然健介并不完全是‘白’的，但这依然搞笑得要命！健介的脸一下子涨得通红，然后关掉了音响。

"I like that song…" the entire group busts out laughing, aside from Kensuke of course.  
“我喜欢那首歌……”除了健介，整个小组都爆笑起来。

"You know Kensuke, you really do need to get yourself a girl. Guys are starting talking at school," Toji, of course, had to throw that out. Hikari gently slaps his chest and gives him a dirty look.  
"你知道吗，真希，你真的该给自己找个女朋友了。学校里的男生们已经开始议论纷纷了，" 东治当然不忘插上一句。光子轻轻拍了拍他的胸口，给了他一个白眼。

"Don't be so mean," Toji then shut up… yeah, see, what he failed to realize is that when you're in a relationship, things change. You can be the meanest dog in the world, but once you're dating someone, you can no longer bite – all you can do is run to the end of your chain and bark. Kensuke looks at Rei and smiles, at which she responds:  
"别这么刻薄，" 东治随即闭上了嘴……是啊，他没意识到的是，当你陷入一段关系时，事情会发生变化。你可以是世界上最刻薄的人，但一旦你开始约会，你就不能再咬人了——你只能跑到链子的尽头，然后吠叫。真希看着丽，微笑了一下，她回应道：

"Not a chance in hell," after a few seconds of staring at Rei in surprise, the entire group laughs loudly.  
"绝无可能，" 在惊讶地盯着丽几秒钟后，整个小组爆发出响亮的笑声。

"Hey Shinji," Asuka speaks softly enough so that no one else can hear her aside from me, "You wanna go home? I'm getting really tired…" smiling, I guide her up as I stand up.  
"嘿，真嗣，" 明日香轻声说道，确保只有我能听到，"你想回家吗？我真的很累了……" 我笑着扶她起身，自己也站了起来。

"Yeah, sure. Okay, we're heading home, we should get started on the homework we missed," I used that excuse because if I would have said anything else, we would have been ridiculed for sneaking off to be by ourselves… which is what we were doing…  
"嗯，当然。好吧，我们要回家了，应该开始做我们错过的作业，" 我用这个借口是因为如果我说别的，我们会被嘲笑偷偷溜走独处……虽然这正是我们的打算……

"Okay, see ya man." "好的，再见，伙计。"

"Bye Asuka, hope you feel better." We began to walk off, and one last song from Kensuke began to play.  
“再见，明日香，希望你感觉好些。”我们开始离开，而 Kensuke 的最后一首歌开始播放。

_I like big butts and I can not lie  
我喜欢大屁股，我不能说谎_

_You other bro- 你们这些兄弟——_

Asuka then proceeds to throw two river stones: one at the stereo and one at Kensuke's head.  
随后，明日香拿起两块河石，一块扔向音响，另一块砸向了 Kensuke 的头。

Back at the apartment – 4:00 PM  
回到公寓 —— 下午 4:00

When we got into the small apartment, Asuka immediately went into the bathroom to get changed; she was complaining about her two-piece being itchy when it's dry, so she didn't waste any time. In the five minutes that she was in there, I set up her bed with a thick, feather down comforter and my pillow because she mentioned that she likes to use it every now and then. On top of that, I got my own bed set up, mainly because after seeing the comfortable setting, I got slightly drowsy myself. Just as I was finishing up she walked out of the bathroom in a t-shirt and loose-fitting flannel shorts.  
我们一进到狭小的公寓，明日香立刻冲进浴室换衣服；她抱怨说干了的比基尼让她觉得痒，所以她一刻也没耽搁。在她进去的五分钟里，我给她铺好了床，用的是厚厚的羽绒被和我自己的枕头，因为她说过偶尔喜欢用这个。除此之外，我也给自己铺好了床，主要是因为看到那舒适的布置，我自己也有点犯困了。我刚铺好，她就穿着 T 恤和宽松的法兰绒短裤从浴室走了出来。

"Well aren't you sweet? Thanks," slowly, she crawled into bed and laid her head on the pillow I set up for her, "Your pillow? Wow Shinji, you really do pay attention when I talk, don't you? Most guys just nod when girls talk…" sadly, I'll have to agree with her on this one. Hell, I even saw Toji completely ignoring Hikari when she was talking to him at one point… okay, I shouldn't say 'ignoring', more like not listening to anything she was saying, because he was paying attention to something on her. Luckily for him, she was far enough away to not notice. Me and him were out in the lake – I hadn't told anyone about the snake thing, only Hikari knows – and I literally had to push him to avert his eyes.  
"哎呀，你真贴心？谢谢，"她缓缓爬上床，将头枕在我为她准备的枕头上，"你的枕头？哇，真嗣，你真的有在听我说话，对吧？大多数男生只会点头应付女生的话……"悲哀的是，我不得不在这点上同意她的看法。见鬼，我甚至见过当光子跟他说话时，阿薰完全无视她的情景……好吧，不该说“无视”，更像是没在听她说话，因为他正盯着她身上的某样东西。幸运的是，她离得够远，没注意到。我和他在湖边——我没告诉任何人关于蛇的事情，只有光子知道——我实际上不得不推他一把，让他转移视线。

"Well, most guys are also asses, keep that in mind," she let out a soft chuckle as I crawled into bed.  
"嗯，大多数男生也都是混蛋，记住这点，"她轻声笑了出来，我则爬上了床。

"Good point… sleep good, you might wanna set an alarm for five or something, I just need to rest for a little bit," she was almost asleep instantly, but who could blame her? This has been a pretty eventful day… that and we both just swam two miles a few hours ago. And that's when it hit me; the aches and sores, the cramps, and above all, I was suddenly thrown into a deep relaxation, yet I found myself unable to fall asleep.  
“有道理……好好睡一觉，你或许该设个五点的闹钟，我只需要稍微休息一下。”她几乎立刻就睡着了，谁又能怪她呢？今天真是相当充实的一天……再加上我们几小时前才游了两英里。就在这时，我突然感受到了：那些酸痛和伤口，抽筋，最重要的是，我突然陷入深深的放松，却发现自己无法入睡。

My eyes were stuck, fixated on Asuka's closed eyelids in the bed across from mine. Her head was sunk into the large feather pillow enough to cover a decent portion of her face, and the rest of her body below her shoulders was lost under the heavy comforter, which was being held in place by a single arm resting over it. After a little while, I once again found my mind drifting into multiple topics, mostly about me and her. The main thing that stuck with me is our relationship; we're only fourteen, and, while I hate to say this, most teenage relationships eventually break up. I understand this perfectly, but actually accepting it is another thing. Who will be the one to break it off? When will it happen? Will we still be friends afterwards? I mean, not trying to be cruel here, I have seen Asuka go through at least ten 'boyfriends', how would I be any different? Of course I'd like to sit back and believe that this relationship will last forever, that we could end up getting married, but if I actually look past my hormones, I highly doubt that we'll even be dating for more then a year. Not that I don't love her, I do, but I just can't shake this feeling of doubt… I wonder if she feels the same…  
我的目光凝固了，定定地注视着对面床上明日香紧闭的眼睑。她的头深深埋进那只巨大的羽绒枕中，足以遮住她脸庞的大部分，而肩部以下的身体则隐没在厚重的被褥下，被一只横搭在上面的手臂固定住。过了一会儿，我的思绪再次飘散到多个话题上，大多关于我和她。最萦绕心头的是我们的关系；我们才十四岁，虽然不愿承认，但大多数青少年恋情最终都会分手。我对此心知肚明，但真正接受却是另一回事。谁会提出分手？何时会发生？之后我们还能做朋友吗？我的意思是，并非有意刻薄，我见过明日香至少经历了十个“男朋友”，我又能有何不同？当然，我愿意坐下来相信这段关系会永恒，我们甚至可能结婚，但如果我抛开荷尔蒙的影响，我高度怀疑我们连一年都撑不过去。并非我不爱她，我确实爱她，但我就是无法摆脱这种疑虑的感觉……我想知道她是否也有同样的感觉……

4:55 PM 下午 4:55

It took me quite awhile to actually get to sleep after thinking about our relationship, but when I finally did, it was probably the worst sleep I've ever had. It was short lived, about half an hour, and my mind was just darting too often for me to get anything that resembles a fulfilling sleep. In fact, I was mildly happy when I woke up, and even more so when I found out WHY I woke up. After I was nudged awake, it took me a good two minutes before realizing what brought me out of my sleep. Asuka had found herself a nice little spot next to me, and was peacefully asleep, holding me close to her. My back was to her, which was probably why it took me so long to, and she had her right arm around my torso.  
思考我们的关系后，我花了相当长的时间才真正入睡，但当我终于睡着时，那可能是我有生以来最糟糕的一次睡眠。它很短暂，大约半小时，我的思绪跳跃得太频繁，以至于我无法获得任何类似于满足感的睡眠。事实上，当我醒来时，我感到轻微的快乐，当我发现我醒来的原因时，这种快乐更加强烈。在我被轻轻唤醒后，我花了大约两分钟才意识到是什么把我从睡梦中带了出来。明日香找到了一个舒适的小地方躺在我旁边，安静地睡着，紧紧地抱着我。我的背对着她，这可能就是为什么我花了这么长时间才意识到，她用右手臂环绕着我的躯干。

"Sleep good?" and here I thought she was still asleep.  
"睡得好吗？" 我还以为她还在睡呢。

"Not really, but this is fine with me," she let out a small chuckle as I rolled over to make eye contact with her, "Not that I'm complaining, but why'd you come in here?" she blushes slightly and smiles.  
"不太好，但我觉得这样也不错，" 她轻笑一声，我翻身与她对视，"我不是在抱怨，但你为什么来这里？" 她微微脸红，笑了笑。

"Actually, I don't even remember doing it… but I have to admit, this is pretty nice," if anyone were to walk in right now, we'd never hear the end of it, but I really don't care right now. Of course, like a beckon, the alarm went off, making us both jump out of our skins. I reach over and turn it off, only to see Rei standing in the doorway, thankfully by herself, holding the cooler and very wide eyed.  
"其实，我甚至不记得自己是怎么来的……但我得承认，这感觉挺好的，" 如果现在有人走进来，我们肯定会没完没了地被调侃，但我现在真的不在乎。当然，就像被召唤一样，闹钟响了，把我们都吓了一跳。我伸手关掉它，只见丽站在门口，幸好只有她一个人，手里拿着冷却器，眼睛睁得大大的。

"Rei! This isn't what it looks like!" she just stood still… not a good sign. With a smile, Asuka lays her head on my chest and makes small circles on my stomach with her forefinger.  
"丽！这不是看起来那样的！" 她只是静静地站着……不是好兆头。阿斯卡微笑着，将头靠在我的胸前，用她的食指在我的肚子上画着小圈。

"No, not at all…" now is NOT the time to be screwing around Asuka!  
"不，完全不是……" 现在可不是胡闹的时候，阿斯卡！

"That's… fairly disgusting… did you stay off of my bed?" Asuka busts out laughing and Rei gets her normal emotionless face on, "You find that funny?"  
"那……相当恶心……你没睡我的床吧？" 阿斯卡爆发出笑声，丽恢复了她平常的无表情状态，"你觉得这很好笑吗？"

"Oh come on Rei, lighten up, we didn't do anything," Asuka stand up and stretches her arms above her head, "You really need to learn how to take a joke," that was NOT funny! What if that had been Misato?! We would have been so screwed!  
“拜托，丽，放松点，我们什么都没做，”明日香站起来，伸了个懒腰，“你真的需要学会开玩笑，”那一点都不好笑！要是那是美里怎么办？我们就完蛋了！

"Misato wanted to see you two about something," … okay, that's just fucked up right there… just then, Misato, with crossed arms and in a nice black dress, makes an appearance in the doorway… crap…  
“美里想见你们两个，”……好吧，这真是太扯了……就在这时，美里双臂交叉，穿着一件漂亮的黑色连衣裙，出现在门口……糟糕……

"Aren't you two a little young to be sleeping together?" great, here comes 'the talk', even though we weren't even in bed together for an hour, "I'll forget about this for now, but you need to come with me. I forgot to tell you this before, but NERV is having a banquette, and of course, the pilots have to be there. Get into some dress clothes, and try to hurry, it starts in an hour. I'll meet you in my car outside," oh great, now our dress clothes are going to get blood on them!  
“你们两个是不是太年轻了，就睡在一起？”天啊，‘那番谈话’来了，虽然我们连一个小时都没在床上待过，“我现在先不提这事，但你们得跟我走。我之前忘了告诉你们，NERV 要举办一个宴会，当然，驾驶员必须到场。换上正装，尽量快点，一小时后开始。我在外面的车里等你们，”哦，太好了，现在我们的正装要沾上血了！

"Okay, no problem, just give us half an hour," while I wasn't going to say anything, I could get ready in less than ten minutes, but Asuka takes forever to get ready! Misato nods and walks back to her car, which she proceeds to blast the stereo, trying to pass time, "You get ready in the bathroom, and try to hurry," yeah, she's telling ME to hurry up! I grab my tux and do what I was told, and after five minutes, I was completely ready to go… yet I was still stuck in the bathroom… "I need to get my makeup done, I hope Shinji gets done soon," I hear Asuka speaking to Rei, and I take that as a cue to come out… bad idea.  
"好的，没问题，给我们半小时就行，" 虽然我没打算说什么，但我十分钟内就能准备好，可明日香准备起来可就慢多了！美里点点头，走回她的车，开始大声播放音响，试图打发时间，"你去浴室准备，尽量快点，" 她居然在催我快点！我拿起我的礼服，照她说的做了，五分钟后，我就完全准备好了……然而我还是被困在浴室里……"我得化妆，希望真嗣快点弄完，" 我听到明日香在对丽说话，我便趁机出来……糟糕的主意。

"It's all yo-" now, as I walked out of the bathroom, I saw something that I was punished for. I'm not going to saw exactly what I saw, but I think everyone knows, and I'm fairly sure that everyone within a four-mile radius heard Asuka's yelling. While I did earn myself a punch to the stomach and a blown-out eardrum, there was obviously one upside. I stumbled back into the bathroom and closed the door as quickly as I could, sat on the toilet and tried to catch my breath.  
"都是你-" 现在，当我走出浴室时，我看到了一件让我受罚的事情。我不会具体说看到了什么，但我想大家都知道，而且我敢肯定，方圆四英里内的人都听到了明日香的尖叫。虽然我确实挨了一拳肚子，耳朵也差点聋了，但显然有一个好处。我踉跄着退回浴室，迅速关上门，坐在马桶上，试图喘口气。

"I told you to stay in the bathroom damnit!" yeah… I can tell… five minutes later, she comes storming into the bathroom, yells at me to get out, and I meet Misato outside in her car.  
"我告诉过你待在浴室里，该死的！" 是啊…我能感觉到…五分钟后，她怒气冲冲地闯进浴室，对我大吼让我出去，然后我在外面见到了美里小姐的车里。

"You know Shinji, you can only pull that so many times before she catches on," yeah, I like to get my ass kicked!  
"你知道的，真嗣，你只能这样骗她几次，之后她就会识破了，" 是啊，我倒是喜欢被她揍！

"I didn't mean to! She's the one that said she needed the bathroom, so I went out and… yeah…" at least Rei wasn't in sight, because in that case I probably would have lost my head! "Can I sit in the front seat? I don't think I'll be safe in the back with Asuka," all Misato does is laugh, "Please?"  
"我不是故意的！是她自己说需要用浴室的，所以我才出去的…是啊…" 至少丽不在视线内，否则我可能真的会吓得魂飞魄散！ "我能坐前排吗？我觉得和明日香一起坐在后排不太安全，" 美里只是笑笑，"拜托？"

"Fine, but I can't protect you all day," grabbing my seat up front, we wait for the girls to finish up. Just as Misato was getting annoyed on them, Asuka emerges from the apartment with Rei behind her. Rei looked rather plain, even thought she was dressed up; no matter how she dresses or how she acts, there's always this feeling around her that keeps people at a distance, even me.  
"好吧，但我没法整天保护你，"我抓起前排座位，我们等着女孩们收拾完。就在美里对她们感到不耐烦时，明日香从公寓里走了出来，丽跟在她后面。丽看起来相当朴素，尽管她打扮了一番；无论她如何穿着或举止，总有一种感觉让她与他人保持距离，甚至包括我。

Asuka, on the other hand, was to say the least gorgeous. She was in a blood-red, long dress that guided your eyes down to her high-heels that were basically all straps that winded around her feet to keep themselves in place. Her dress was one that the father of a normal girl would have a heart attack over – with the low-cut neck (VERY low-cut), the slit going up her right leg, and the spaghetti straps, I almost had one myself! – but hey, who's complaining? Honestly, they way she held herself and how she looked, she could pass for an adult if it wasn't for her height. The makeup she had on was subtle, but still noticeable; lipstick that matched her natural lip color, but at the same time matched what she was wearing. To my eyes, that was all the makeup she had on, but knowing her, there was defiantly more. When she saw me looking at her, she seemed to glare and smile at me the same time, as if to say 'you can look, but watch out'. Feeling slightly better about what I did, I get out of the front seat and into the back, but not before holding the door for her and Rei.  
另一方面，明日香可谓美艳绝伦。她身着一袭血红色的长裙，裙摆引领视线滑落至她那几乎全由缠绕脚踝的细带构成的高跟鞋上。这条裙子，若是普通女孩的父亲见了，恐怕会心脏病发——低胸设计（极低），右侧高开叉，以及细如面条的肩带，连我都差点被吓到！——不过，谁会抱怨呢？说真的，她那自信的姿态和成熟的风采，若非身高稍显稚嫩，简直可以冒充成年人。她的妆容淡雅却又不失存在感；唇膏与她自然的唇色相得益彰，同时也与她的着装完美搭配。在我看来，这似乎就是她全部的妆容，但了解她的人都知道，肯定不止这些。当她发现我在打量她时，她似乎同时投来了既像是警告又似微笑的目光，仿佛在说“你可以看，但要小心”。我对自己所做的事感到稍许释然，于是从前座移至后座，但在关门前不忘为她和绫留出空间。

"So…" Asuka speaks soft enough so only I could hear it, which was actually pretty loud to battle against the roaring of the engine, "Did you do that on purpose?"  
"所以…" 明日香轻声说道，只有我能听见，但在引擎的轰鸣声中却显得格外响亮，"你是故意的吗？"

"No, I swear, I thought you wanted the bathroom!" she laughs before speaking again.  
"不，我发誓，我以为你想要用洗手间！" 她笑着再次开口。

"Calm down Shinji, it was an accident; just don't let it happen again, okay?" she laces her fingers into mine and smiles, and I repeat the gesture, "So, did ya like what you saw?" she did not just ask me that!  
"冷静点，真嗣，这是个意外；别再让它发生了，好吗？" 她将手指缠绕在我的手指上，微笑着，我也回以同样的动作，"那么，你喜欢你看到的吗？" 她居然这么问我！

"Um… well… I…" she once again laughs.  
"嗯…这个…我…" 她又一次笑了起来。

"I'll take that as a yes!"  
"我就当你是同意了！"

6:10 PM 晚上 6:10

"Arriving fashionably late I see," of course, Gendo had to throw in his smartass comment before even greeting us, "You three, go sit over there, you'll be called up to the stage soon," without a word, me, Rei and Asuka take our seat at a table placed in the middle of the enormous room, in eyeshot of everyone else.  
"看来是时髦地迟到了啊，" 当然，碇司令在打招呼之前还得先来句自以为是的评论，"你们三个，去那边坐下，很快就会叫你们上台了，" 我们三人——我、绫波和明日香——一言不发地坐在房间中央的一张桌子旁，所有人都能看到我们。

"So what, do we just sit here until we're called up? No food? No drink? Nothing? I can see NERV went all out on this…" you just gotta love that personality!  
"就这样干坐着等叫我们上台吗？没有吃的？没有喝的？什么都没有？我看得出 NERV 在这上面可是下了血本……" 你不得不爱这种性格！

"What is this for anyway?" both girls shrug, having no idea themselves. Out of nowhere, a boy our age jets into the free seat at our table, scaring the crap out of me, pissing of Asuka, and having absolutely no effect on Rei.  
"这到底是为了什么？" 两个女孩都耸了耸肩，她们自己也不知道。突然间，一个和我们同龄的男孩冲进了我们桌旁的空位，吓得我魂飞魄散，惹恼了明日香，而对绫波却毫无影响。

"Who the hell are you?!" the boy was obviously American, and frankly, it looked like he belonged in a freak show. He had shoulder-length, pitch black hair and brown eyes. His cheek bones were very sculpted, as was his chin.  
"你到底是谁？！" 那男孩显然是美国人，坦白说，他看起来像是马戏团里的怪胎。他有着齐肩的乌黑头发和棕色眼睛。他的颧骨和下巴都非常有棱角。

"Oh, sorry about that, I'm Paul Seba. Truthfully, I'm not really supposed to be in here, which is why I'm trying to hide from security. Don't rat me out, okay?" a few big guys in security uniforms walked by, and Paul leaped under the table, avoid their sight. When they were gone, he came back up and went wide eyed, "WHOA! You guys are the pilots! That's exactly why I'm in here!" okay, someone's a little slow…  
"哦，抱歉，我是保罗·塞巴。老实说，我不应该在这里，这就是为什么我在躲避保安。别告发我，好吗？" 几个穿着保安制服的大个子走了过去，保罗跳到桌子底下，避开他们的视线。他们离开后，他重新站起来，瞪大了眼睛，"哇！你们是飞行员！这就是我在这里的原因！" 好吧，有人反应有点慢……

"Oh, so you came to bask in the glory of us, did you?" and there's Asuka's sarcastic comment of the day, "Seriously, give me one good reason not to call those guards right back here!"  
"哦，所以你是来沐浴我们的荣耀的，是吗？" 还有明日香今天的讽刺语录，"说真的，给我一个不马上叫那些保安回来的好理由！"

"Has anyone ever told you that you look similar to Paul Allender?" Rei cuts in directly after Asuka finishes.  
"有人告诉过你，你看起来像保罗·阿伦德吗？" 丽在明日香说完后直接插话道。

"Actually, yeah, I got that all the time back in the US. I'm surprised someone from Japan knows of him," someone want to tell me who the hell Paul Allender is?  
"实际上，是的，我在美国时经常有人这么说。我很惊讶日本也有人知道他，" 有人能告诉我保罗·阿伦德到底是谁吗？"

"Let him stay, give him a chance. Why exactly did you want to meet us?" Rei obviously took an immediate liking to him for some reason… but still, WHO THE HELL IS PAUL ALLENDER?! It's starting to bug me now!  
"让他留下，给他一个机会。你到底为什么想见我们？" 丽显然因为某种原因立刻对他产生了好感……但还是，保罗·阿伦德到底是谁？！我开始觉得困扰了！

"Why did I want to meet you? Why not! I've been trying to find you guys since I moved here a month ago!" and of course, due to him being loud, he was tackled to the ground by the two security guards.  
“我为什么要见你？为什么不呢！自从一个月前搬到这里，我一直在找你们！”当然，由于他声音太大，被两名保安扑倒在地。

"Sorry about that, we'll get rid of him," and they did just that. Picking him up by the back of his shirt and his pants, they literally hurled him out of the building… I always thought that 'throwing you out' was an expression! We didn't really talk about him too much the rest of the night – that is until we saw him sneak back in, and once again was thrown out.  
“抱歉，我们会把他弄走，”他们确实这么做了。拎起他的衬衫和裤子，直接把他扔出了大楼……我一直以为“把你扔出去”只是个说法！那晚我们没怎么再谈他——直到我们看到他偷偷溜回来，再次被扔了出去。

"And now what we're all here for – to thank the young adults that kept this great city in… let's say almost perfect condition," the crowd laughs a little, but it was obviously fake, "Why don't you three come up here? Please give a warm welcome to Rei Ayanami, Shinji Ikari and Asuka Langly Soryu!" with annoyed faces planted on every one of us, we stood up and made our way to the stage. Once up there, the crowd once again applauded us and, when they finished, the annoying man came back to the microphone, "So, what's it feel like to save the world?"  
“现在是我们大家来这里的目的——感谢那些让这座伟大城市保持……可以说近乎完美状态的年轻人，”人群轻笑了几声，但显然是假的，“你们三位上来吧？请热烈欢迎绫波零、碇真嗣和惣流·明日香·兰格雷！”我们每个人都面带不悦，站起来走向舞台。一上台，人群再次为我们鼓掌，结束后，那个讨厌的男人回到麦克风前，“那么，拯救世界是什么感觉？”

"It feels like we didn't have much of a choice in the matter, even if we said no we would have been forced into doing it. It feels like we don't have lives outside of NERV. It feels like shit. That a good enough answer for you?" ho… ly… crap…  
"感觉我们在这件事上没多少选择，就算我们说不，也会被迫去做。感觉我们的生活完全围绕着 NERV 转。感觉糟透了。这个回答你满意吗？" 天…哪…

"Asuka, are you okay?" I mutter through slightly closed lips.  
"明日香，你还好吗？" 我嘴唇微闭地低声说道。

"No, I'm not! You all came here to celebrate what? Us? Why bother? None of you seemed to give a rat's ass about us until we finished! Did you people even know that there was fourth pilot? I don't see him up here today! Most of you hated us until we saved your pathetic asses! We were slandered in newspapers, hated because we couldn't save every damn person, but now that you're all safe and you don't need to blame anyone, you applaud us! Me and Rei had no lives until the Angels were gone! She was trained from birth, and I started my training when I was four! Do you people even care that we didn't have a childhood?" the entire room was silent, "The only person that every treated us like actual human beings was Misato, SHE should be the one up here! She was like a mother to me and Shinji! When neither of us had parents to go to, she was there for us!"  
"不，我不好！你们来这里庆祝什么？我们吗？何必呢？在任务完成之前，你们似乎根本不在乎我们！你们这些人甚至知道有第四位驾驶员吗？我今天没看到他在这里！在救了你们这些可怜的家伙之前，你们大多数人讨厌我们！我们在报纸上被诽谤，因为无法救每一个人而遭到憎恨，但现在你们都安全了，不需要再怪罪任何人，就开始为我们鼓掌！我和绫波在使徒消失之前根本没有生活！她从出生就开始训练，而我从四岁就开始了！你们这些人有谁在乎我们没有童年吗？" 整个房间一片寂静，"唯一把我们当真正人类对待的人是美里，她才应该是站在这里的那个人！她对我就像母亲一样，对真嗣也是！当我和真嗣都没有父母可以依靠时，她一直在我们身边！

"Soryu does have a point…" now's not the time Rei!  
"惣流确实有道理…" 但现在不是时候，丽！

"I… think we should go home now…"  
"我… 觉得我们现在应该回家了…"

A/N – Eh… not too much to say here… I really didn't mean to have Asuka say all that. It just kinda came out on accident… whatever, it worked. Okay, concerning the OC Paul Seba, like Rei said, he looks like Paul Allender from Cradle of Filth, just younger. Keep that creepy look in Allender's eye in mind, because Seba has the same thing. Yeah… so… read the next chapter; Back To School, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记 – 呃… 这里没什么太多要说的… 我真的没打算让明日香说那些话。它就那样意外地脱口而出了… 不管怎样，效果达到了。关于原创角色保罗·塞巴，就像丽说的，他看起来像年轻的克雷德尔·费尔特的保罗·阿伦德，只是更年轻。记住阿伦德那阴森的眼神，因为塞巴也有同样的眼神。是的… 所以… 阅读下一章 chapter；返校，在此之前，继续保持！

A/A/N – Wow, I'm out of swing with the whole chapter-teaser thing…  
A/A/N – 哇，我对这个chapter预告片的事情完全不在状态了……

### Chapter 16: Back To School

5:30 AM – Rei's Apartment – Next Day  
凌晨 5:30 – 丽的小公寓 – 次日

"Damn, I forgot how much these uniforms suck…" the sun was just recently making an appearance above the horizon, and may I say, I never want to see it again! No person should EVER have to get up this early! I didn't even know that there WAS a five-thirty AM! Rei's apartment is much further away from the school then Misato's was, so we have to get up half an hour earlier. Now, most would say 'big deal, thirty minutes'… it is a big damn deal! This sucks!  
"“该死，我忘了这些校服有多糟糕了……”太阳刚刚在地平线上露脸，我得说，我再也不想看到它了！没有人应该这么早起床！我甚至不知道五点半早上存在！丽的小公寓离学校比美里那儿远多了，所以我们得早起半小时。大多数人会说‘没什么大不了的，才三十分钟’……这可是个大麻烦！真糟糕！”

"What's a uniform…?" Asuka was still pretty much asleep, dragging her feet as we walked.  
"制服是什么…？" 明日香还处于半睡半醒状态，拖着脚步和我们一起走。

"I honestly don't see the problem; the air is fresh, the sun is just rising, and above all, it's quiet. I find it enjoyable," okay, this was the first time that I didn't like Rei's new personality!  
"老实说，我不觉得这有什么问题；空气清新，太阳刚刚升起，最重要的是，这里很安静。我觉得很享受，" 好吧，这是我第一次不喜欢丽的新性格！

"It's quiet because everyone's still asleep…" I let out a long yawn throughout the entire sentence, "Like we should be…"  
"安静是因为大家都还在睡觉…" 我在这整句话中打了一个长长的哈欠，"就像我们应该做的那样…"

"Hey Shinji… carry me…?" I put my arm around her waist, and she copies the action, "I meant literally carry me… but this is better then nothing…" she leans her head on my shoulder as we walk, "You do know that I'll be sleeping in class, right?"  
"嘿，真嗣…背我好吗？"我把手臂搭在她的腰间，她也模仿我的动作，"我是说真的背我…不过这样也不错…"她把头靠在我的肩膀上，我们一同走着，"你知道我会在课堂上睡觉的，对吧？"

"Hey guys! Wait up!" "嘿，伙计们！等等我！"

"Oh Jesus Christ… not this early…" Asuka mumbles a few curses under her breath as Hikari comes running up next to me, "Hey Hikari…"  
"哦，天哪…这么早…"明日香低声咒骂了几句，当光里跑到我旁边时，"嘿，光里…"

"Wow, you two look horrible, didn't sleep good?" no, we slept great, we just got hit over the head with shovels before we came out, why do you ask?  
"“哇，你们俩看起来糟透了，昨晚没睡好吗？” 不，我们睡得很好，只是出门前被铲子敲了头，你问这个干嘛？”

"No, we slept great, we just got hit over the head with shovels before we came out, why do you ask?" … okay, that's just creepy right there… either Asuka's rubbing off on me or she's friggen psychic! "It's too damn early… come back with your perky attitude in an hour after I've gotten some sleep…" Hikari just laughs, "Where's Toji anyway? Don't you two pretty much spend time together twenty-four-seven now?" yeah, she's one to talk seeing as we live together! We literally do spend every hour of the day together.  
"“不，我们睡得很好，只是出门前被铲子敲了头，你问这个干嘛？” …好吧，这有点诡异了…要么是明日香影响了我，要么她就是个彻头彻尾的通灵者！“现在太早了…带着你那精神饱满的态度一小时后再回来，等我睡醒了…” 光只是笑着说，“反正现在东治在哪儿？你们俩现在不是几乎二十四小时都在一起吗？” 是啊，她还好意思说，毕竟我们住在一起！我们确实每天每时每刻都在一起。”

"Oh come on Asuka, it's not THAT early!" to her, "I bet you're just trying to find an excuse to hang all over Shinji!"  
"“哦，拜托，明日香，没那么早吧！” 对她，“我打赌你只是找个借口想黏着真嗣！””

"I'll yell at you later…" after five minutes, Asuka was slightly more awake, and we were at the gates of the school. Before heading into our classroom, we ran into Kensuke with a fixed stereo, Toji making fun of Kensuke for the music he was playing – some old jazz, and of course, our teacher slowly making his way to the classroom. We followed close behind him, Toji planted a few signs on his back (among them, 'Kick Me', 'I smell like chese', 'Old Fart', and 'Jale bait')… he never was too good at spelling or insults, let alone spelling insults.  
"我待会儿再吼你……"五分钟后，明日香稍微清醒了些，我们已到达学校大门口。在走进教室之前，我们遇到了拿着固定音响的真希波，东治在嘲笑真希波播放的音乐——一些老爵士乐，当然，我们的老师正慢慢走向教室。我们紧随其后，东治在他背上贴了几张标签（包括'踢我'、'我闻起来像奶酪'、'老顽固'和'嫉妒诱饵'）……他的拼写和侮辱向来不太行，更别提拼写侮辱了。

"Okay children, take your seats, we'll be reviewing history today…" he soon drifted off into a Charlie Brown teacher-type talk because as always, we began a chat session. You know, the schools really are stupid for giving us all laptops with this program on it!  
"好了，孩子们，坐下吧，今天我们要复习历史……"他很快就像查理·布朗的老师那样开始喃喃自语，因为一如既往，我们开始了一场聊天会话。你知道的，学校真是蠢，居然给我们所有人配备了装有这个程序的笔记本电脑！

**You have entered ';.;' 你已进入 ';.;'**

Lunch 午餐

"So Asuka," instead of sitting with the group like we normally do, me and Asuka found a nice spot on the roof to talk, "What happened to you last night? I haven't seen you that upset in a long time," I mean, she has her short outbursts, but she was mad all night because of that.  
“所以，明日香，”我们没有像往常一样坐在人群中，而是和明日香在屋顶上找了个好地方聊天，“昨晚你怎么了？我很久没见你这么难过过了，”我是说，她有时会短暂爆发，但昨晚她因为那件事整晚都很生气。

"I was angry because I'm sick of being labeled as a pilot! I mean sure, that's all I valued a little while back, but ever since we finished it's been annoying me. All I ever hear is 'Oh! There goes the second child!' I don't even have a name out in public anymore! And what's even worse is that after I got to thinking about it, I realized that I have no other talents aside from piloting. I mean, you have the cello, Rei's pretty much a genius, and Toji's athletic. I may have been smart back in Germany, but here I'm just average, if not below average. I'm just…" she clenches her eyes shut and tightens her fist, "Damnit!"  
"我生气是因为我受够了被贴上'驾驶员'的标签！我是说，虽然不久前我还很看重这一点，但自从我们完成任务后，这让我越来越烦。我听到的总是'哦！那个二号机驾驶员来了！'我在公众场合连个名字都没有了！更糟糕的是，当我仔细思考后，我意识到除了驾驶，我没有任何其他才能。我是说，你有大提琴，丽是个天才，而真嗣是运动员。我在德国时可能很聪明，但在这里我只是普通，甚至可能低于平均水平。我只是……"她紧闭双眼，握紧拳头，"该死！"

"Whoa, Asuka, calm down," I wrap my arms around her, which is when I notice a small tear running down her face, "You know that's not true, where's this even coming from?"  
"哇，明日香，冷静点，"我抱住她，这时我注意到她脸颊上有一滴泪珠滑落，"你知道这不是真的，这到底是从哪儿冒出来的？"

"Yes it is! Name one talent I have aside from piloting! Just one!"  
"就是真的！除了驾驶，你说出一个我的才能来！就一个！"

"You're an amazing woman, that should be enough. You don't need a titled talent, you've always been above that," she keeps quiet, her entire body tense and tears slowly making their way down her face.  
"你是个了不起的女人，这已经足够了。你不需要什么头衔才能，你一直都超越了那些，" 她保持沉默，整个身体紧绷，泪水缓缓滑过脸颊。

"Asuka Langley Soryu, five foot four, three-fourths German, one fourth Japanese. Red hair, blue eyes. Age 14, birthday – December 4th, 2001. Mother, Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu, father, undisclosed. Born in Germany, moved to Japan at age 13. Current guardian, Misato Katsuragi, former guardian, Ryoji Kaji," we both look up to see Rei standing above us, staring down at Asuka with disgusted eyes, "That's the vitals NERV has in their database for you."  
"惣流·明日香·兰格雷，身高五英尺四英寸，四分之三德国血统，四分之一日本血统。红发，蓝眼。年龄 14 岁，生日——2001 年 12 月 4 日。母亲，惣流·葛城·京子，父亲，未公开。出生于德国，13 岁时移居日本。现任监护人，葛城美里，前任监护人，加持良治，" 我们俩抬头看到绫波零站在我们上方，用厌恶的眼神盯着明日香，"这是 NERV 数据库中关于你的基本信息。"

"Fuck off! I don't need your damn attitude right now!"  
"滚开！我现在不需要你那该死的态度！"

"Oh grow up!" Rei actually yelled down at Asuka before kneeling down, grabbing Asuka's collar and bringing her to her feet. Asuka, obviously surprised, was frozen, "You know damn well what you're saying is nonsense! You know where you were born! You know your birthday! You knew you mother! You have friends! Do you know where I was born? In a fucking test tube! Do you know my birthday? I don't have one because I wasn't born! Do you know my parents? No, because I don't have any! I didn't even have a name until I was three! I was just the First Child! I had no friends until you two moved in with me! Now stop your damn whining, because there are people MUCH worse off then you are!" by now, Rei's face was a couple inches from a pale Asuka's. The look in Rei's eye was something I've never seen in her before… hell, something I've never seen in anyone before, "You need to stop being so damn selfish and think of someone else for once in your life!" she lets go of Asuka's collar, letting her stumble back slightly, "So that's it? You have nothing to say?" Asuka took a breath as if to say something, but retreated from the comment, "Yeah, that's what I thought."  
"哦，成熟点吧！" 丽竟然对着明日香大吼，然后跪下，抓住明日香的衣领将她拽起来。明日香显然被吓到了，愣在原地，"你明明知道自己在胡说八道！你知道你出生在哪里！你知道你的生日！你记得你母亲！你有朋友！你知道我出生在哪里吗？在一个该死的试管里！你知道我的生日吗？我没有生日，因为我根本没出生过！你知道我的父母吗？不，因为我没有父母！我三岁前甚至没有名字！我只是第一使徒！直到你们两个搬来和我一起住，我才有了朋友！现在别再他妈的抱怨了，因为比你处境更糟的人多了去了！" 此时，丽的脸离苍白的明日香只有几英寸。丽眼中的神情是我从未在她身上见过的……见鬼，我从未在任何人身上见过，"你需要停止如此自私，这辈子至少为别人考虑一次！" 她松开明日香的衣领，让她稍微踉跄后退，"就这样？你无话可说了吗？" 明日香深吸一口气，似乎想说些什么，但又退缩了，"是啊，我也是这么想的。"

"But…" "但是…"

"But nothing! You need to lose the excuses and take responsibility!" is this really coming from Ayanami?  
“但什么都没有！你得丢掉借口，承担责任！”这真的是绫波说的吗？

"Just… leave me alone…" with that, Asuka walks away with a fairly steady pace. I tried to go after her, but Rei held out her arm, stopping me.  
“就…让我一个人待着…”说完，明日香步伐相当稳健地走开了。我试图追上去，但绫波伸出手臂拦住了我。

"Let her go, she'll be fine. I know what I said was hurtful, but she'll think about what I said and fix her own mental problems. There's a lot you don't know about Soryu Shinji. Whether you find out or not is up to her, but even if she tells you, it will eat at her. She needs to learn how to solve this mental anguish of hers on her own, all we can do is push her in the right way. I don't recommend doing what I did, she's more likely to be hurt by you then by me. She loves you Shinji, more then you'll ever know I'll bet." Rei did more then lecture Asuka that day, she opened both of our minds to different possibilities… whether that's a good thing or not, I'm still not too sure.  
“让她走吧，她会没事的。我知道我说的话很伤人，但她会思考我说的，并解决自己的心理问题。关于碇真嗣，你有很多不知道的事情。你是否能了解，取决于她，但即便她告诉你，这也会困扰她。她需要学会自己解决这种心理痛苦，我们能做的只是引导她走向正确的方向。我不建议你做我做过的事，她更容易被你伤害，而不是我。她爱你，真嗣，比你想象的还要深，我敢打赌。”那天，绫波不仅教训了明日香，还为我们俩打开了不同可能性的大门…这是好事还是坏事，我至今仍不确定。

Back in the classroom – 2:30 PM  
回到教室 – 下午 2:30

My entire class period was spent staring at Asuka, I didn't hear a single word that the teacher said. She had her head resting on her right hand, while her left hand subtly played with her right sleeve. While she would have looked normal to any other person, I could see in her eyes that she was lost in an extremely deep thought – almost as if her sole wasn't even in her body. Her eyes had lost that brilliant shine they once had, and now they were filled with an emotionless aura.  
整个课时我都在盯着明日香，老师说的每一句话我都没听进去。她把头靠在右手上，左手则悄悄地摆弄着右边的袖子。对其他人来说，她看起来可能很正常，但我能从她的眼神中看出，她陷入了极深的沉思——仿佛她的灵魂根本不在身体里。她的眼睛失去了曾经的光彩，现在充满了无情的气息。

"Asuka…" I try to get her attention, which is normally an effortless task being as I'm sitting next to her, but she paid no attention to me whatsoever, even when I nudged her with my elbow, "Come on Asuka, don't be like that. Rei didn't mean it, she just lost her temper… hey, do-"  
“明日香…” 我试图引起她的注意，通常这对我来说轻而易举，因为我坐在她旁边，但她完全没注意到我，即使我用胳膊肘轻轻碰了她，“拜托，明日香，别这样。绫波不是故意的，她只是失控了…嘿，你听我说-”

"STOP TALKING!" the teacher slams his hands on my desk, making everyone jump, aside from Asuka. I stand up to meet him up at eye-level.  
“别说话了！”老师猛地把手拍在我的桌子上，除了明日香，所有人都吓了一跳。我站起来，与他平视。

"Oh shut the hell up old man!" he goes wide-eyed, and then smiles.  
“哦，闭嘴吧，老家伙！”他瞪大了眼睛，然后笑了。

"That's the kind of attitude I like to see form students! Carry on," okay, while that was cool, I really couldn't bask in it. Now that the teacher wouldn't bother us, I grab Asuka's wrist and pretty much drag her out of the room. When outside of the school, I put my hands on her shoulders and stare at her deeply in those blank eyes.  
“我喜欢看到学生有这样的态度！继续吧，”好吧，虽然那很酷，但我真的不能沉浸其中。既然老师不会再打扰我们，我抓住明日香的手腕，几乎是把她拖出了教室。在校外，我把手放在她的肩膀上，深深地凝视着她那双空洞的眼睛。

"Asuka, listen to me, I don't know why all of the sudden this crap started, but I'm here to help you through it. I can't do that if you don't talk," there was some firmness in my voice, but not enough to make it sound hostile.  
"明日香，听我说，我不知道为什么突然间这一切发生了，但我在这里是要帮你度过难关的。如果你不说话，我就无法做到这一点，"我的声音里有些坚定，但还不足以听起来有敌意。

"Will you just leave me alone?" her eyes are glues to the floor at our feet.  
"你能不能就让我一个人待着？"她的目光紧盯着我们脚下的地板。

"No, I won't… look at me," slowly, her eyes make their way to my face, "Why did this start?"  
"不，我不会……看着我，"慢慢地，她的目光移到了我的脸上，"这一切是怎么开始的？"

"I don't know… I guess it just really hit me that night… I mean, that entire thing was for the pilots that saved the world, not the people. See, you were just thrown into NERV recently; I've been training since I was a little girl. It literally WAS my life, and ever since we finished…" tears once again start to run down her face, and I take her into a gentle embrace, "They chose me because I have no family, if I would have died, no one would have cared."  
"我不知道……我想那晚真的让我感触很深……我的意思是，整个事件是为了那些拯救世界的飞行员，而不是普通人。你看，你最近才加入 NERV；我从很小的时候就开始训练了。那真的是我的生活，自从我们完成之后……"泪水再次从她的脸颊滑落，我轻轻地将她拥入怀中，"他们选择我是因为我没有家庭，如果我死了，没有人会在意。"

"Oh come on, you know that's not true, stop saying things like that," I have to admit, this is starting to get annoying, she keeps on saying these ridiculous things, and she knows damn well they aren't true.  
"哦，拜托，你知道那不是真的，别再说那样的话了，"我不得不承认，这开始变得烦人了，她一直在说这些荒谬的事情，而且她明明知道那不是真的。"

"Rei was right, I'll admit that, but… I just can't help it. I don't know why I'm feeling like this all of the sudden," well it's not the twentieth, so that's not it… "I know I'm being stupid, and I know that none of this makes sense to you, and I'm sorry I'm acting like this, but just give me some time," well, at least she's starting to calm down a little bit. She pulls back from the hug, smiles at me and wipes away her tears, "Come on, let's go home and spend some time together. We don't get too much of that anymore," okay, while this is kind of weird, I'm glad that she's back to 'normal'.  
"丽确实是对的，我承认这一点，但是……我就是控制不住。我不知道为什么突然会有这种感觉，"嗯，今天不是 20 号，所以不是因为这个…… "我知道我这样很傻，也知道这些对你来说毫无意义，我很抱歉这样表现，但请给我一点时间，"至少她开始稍微平静一些了。她从拥抱中抽身，对我微笑并擦去泪水，"来吧，我们回家一起度过一些时光。我们不再像以前那样经常有这样的机会了，"好吧，虽然这有点奇怪，但我很高兴她恢复了‘正常’。

"You sure you're okay?" she pecks me on the lips and nods.  
"你确定你没事吗？"她在我唇上轻啄一下，点了点头。

"Yep, don't you worry about it. Come on, there's a movie coming on pretty soon, I've heard a lot about it."  
"是的，别担心。来吧，有部电影马上要开始了，我听很多人提起过。"

---

Rei's Apartment – 2:30 丽的外寓 – 2:30

"So what's this movie called again?" for some reason, Rei's TV got four-hundred channels, so we had at least four movie channels. One of them was specifically for foreign movies, and the one we were about to watch is an old film from the US.  
“所以这部电影叫什么来着？”不知为何，丽的电视有四百个频道，我们至少有四个电影频道。其中一个专门播放外国电影，而我们即将观看的是一部来自美国的旧片。

"Anaconda, it's about this giant snake that kills everyone. Sounds cool!" only Asuka… only Asuka… "Oh, it's starting!" she turns off the lights and takes a seat next to me on the sofa in front of the 15-inch TV, laying her head on my shoulder.  
“《巨蟒》，讲的是一条巨蛇杀死所有人。听起来很酷！”只有明日香……只有明日香……“哦，开始了！”她关掉灯，在我旁边的沙发上坐下，把头靠在我的肩膀上，面对着那台 15 英寸的电视。

This movie was still in English, so we had to read the subtitles… see, what we didn't know is that there were some translation problems. True, it did translate into 'Anaconda', but in English it has a slight modification. What we also didn't know is that this channel was similar to HBO, they were allowed to show anything… ANYTHING. The movie started off good enough; a couple was in a cabin in a swamp, and the girl found a snake on her bed. Foreshadowing? Yeah, that's what we thought… wrong… very wrong. The REAL translation would have been properly called 'Assaconda', which we found out when then couple went into the bed… and did other 'actions'. That TV was off faster then the girl's pants in the movie.  
这部电影仍然是英文的，所以我们得看字幕……你看，我们不知道的是，字幕翻译有些问题。确实，它翻译成了'巨蟒'，但在英语中略有改动。我们也不知道，这个频道类似于 HBO，他们可以播放任何内容……任何内容。电影开头还不错；一对情侣在沼泽中的一间小屋里，女孩在床上发现了一条蛇。这是伏笔吗？是的，我们当时是这么想的……错了……大错特错。真正的翻译本应恰当地称为'Assaconda'，当那对情侣上床并进行其他'动作'时，我们才发现了这一点……那台电视关得比电影中女孩的裤子还快。

"Well that was a waste of a good movie… and no Shinji, we're not going to watch it."  
“那真是一部好电影的浪费……而且，真嗣，我们不会再看这个了。”

"I wasn't going to ask for that!" damn her…  
“我可没打算要求那个！”该死，她……

"I was joking! Jeez Shinji, you need to lighten up… so, what are we gonna do?" normally we'd have either tests to do with the Evas or we would just screw around at NERV, but now there's really nothing to do. Honestly, Tokyo-3 isn't a kid-friendly environment, there's not too much for us to do.  
"“我开玩笑的！天啊，真嗣，你得放松点……那么，我们该做什么呢？”通常我们不是和 Eva 一起做测试，就是在 NERV 里闲逛，但现在真的没什么可做的。老实说，东京-3 并不是一个适合孩子的环境，我们能做的事情不多。”

"No idea…" “不知道……”

"You wanna watch that movie?"  
“你想看那部电影吗？”

---

"Mr. Ikari!" you know, there's nothing like the crack of a yard stick across your skull to wake you from a nice nap, "No sleeping in my class!" I bring up my head to something horrible, something that you should never wake up to – an old man's crotch in your face.  
“碇同学！”你知道，没有什么比一记教鞭敲在头骨上来得更让人从美梦中惊醒的了，“我的课上不准睡觉！”我抬起头，看到了可怕的东西，那是你绝对不想醒来面对的——一个老头子的胯部正对着你的脸。

"Oh good lord…" the level of the desk was perfectly aligned with the seam of his pants. As he was walking away, I let out a few dry heaves, getting the laughter of Asuka.  
“哦，天哪……”桌面的高度恰好与他的裤缝对齐。他走开后，我忍不住干呕了几声，引来了明日香的一阵嘲笑。

"Nice one Shinji, real smooth," I think that yardstick drew blood… after looking at my watch I see that lunch should just be starting. Okay, now what the hell is up with that? Even my dreams are becoming stressful!  
“干得漂亮，真嗣，真是够圆滑的，”我想那把尺子肯定划破了皮……看了看手表，午餐应该刚刚开始。好吧，这到底是怎么回事？连我的梦都变得这么紧张！

"Okay children, go off to lunch, but if you're late back to class, expect consequences," you know, for an old guy, he sure is strong! That yard stick hurt like hell!  
“好了，孩子们，去吃午饭吧，但如果你们迟到回教室，后果自负，”你知道吗，他虽然是个老头，但力气可真不小！那把尺子打得可真疼！

"You're an idiot Shinji!" Toji comes up from behind me, patting me on the back, "But I gotta admit, you can take a hit! Between fighting Angels, living with Asuka, and random hits, you have to have some endurance!" you know, one of these days, Toji's going to catch Hikari in a bad mood, and she's going to get at him!  
"“你真是个傻瓜，真嗣！” 东治从我身后走过来，拍了拍我的背，“不过我得承认，你挺能挨打的！既要对抗使徒，又要和明日香一起生活，还有各种意外的打击，你肯定得有些耐力！” 你知道吗，总有一天，东治会撞上心情不好的美里，那可就有他受的了！”  
"Oh shut up, I think I have a concussion," Asuka comes up behind me and wraps her arms around my neck.  
“哦，闭嘴吧，我觉得我脑震荡了，” 明日香从我身后走过来，双臂环住我的脖子。

"I thought it was kinda cute how you were sleeping… and then it was hilarious when you got hit!" glad to know that my girlfriend feels my pain… "So, did you like your little nap?"  
“我觉得你睡觉的样子挺可爱的……然后你被打醒的时候真是太搞笑了！” 很高兴知道我的女朋友能感同身受…… “那么，你喜欢你的小憩吗？”

"Like hell I did, I dreamt that Rei told you off," her legs stop moving, making her arms yank back on my neck, "Um… I mean… I love you!"  
"我才没有，我梦到丽把你训了一顿，"她的腿停了下来，使得她的手臂猛地拽了一下我的脖子，"呃……我是说……我爱你！"

"Rei… told… me off?" she then proceeds to burst into laughter, hunching over and holding her stomach as she laughed hysterically, "Like she'd ever have the guts to do that!"  
"丽……训……我？"她接着爆发出大笑，弯下腰捂着肚子，笑得前仰后合，"她哪有胆子做那种事！"

"I fail to see the humor in that," Rei simply stared down at the immobilized Asuka. I look over at Rei to see her standing with that Paul guy… wow, she's bonded with him fairly quickly, didn't she?  
"我看不出这有什么好笑的，"丽只是低头看着动弹不得的明日香。我转头看向丽，她正和那个叫保罗的家伙站在一起……哇，她和他关系发展得挺快，不是吗？"

"Someone wanna tell me why Asuka's laughing so hard?" damn, this guy already knows our names! Slowly, Asuka regains her composure and stands up, only to be scared half to death by Paul.  
"有人能告诉我为什么明日香笑得这么厉害吗？"该死，这家伙已经知道我们的名字了！渐渐地，明日香恢复了镇定，站起身来，却被保罗吓得半死。

"Where the hell did you come from?!"  
"你到底是从哪儿冒出来的？！"

"I told you that he was transferred into our class, did I not?" Rei's got a point there, she did.  
"我不是告诉过你他被转到我们班了吗？"丽说得没错，她的确说过。

"Well I don't listen to what you have to say on the computer! It's normally pointless!" Rei got an annoyed face on, Paul let out a soft chuckle and she slapped his chest… okay, what the hell?  
"“我才不听你在电脑上说什么呢！通常都没意义！”丽露出不悦的表情，保罗轻声笑了笑，她便拍了一下他的胸口……好吧，这到底是怎么回事？”

"Can we eat now? I'm starving here!" Kensuke yells from the back of the group like a jackass. We eventually make our way to the tables outside, and soon enough… I realize that I forgot to grab my lunch.  
"“我们现在能吃饭了吗？我快饿死了！”健介在队伍后面像个傻瓜一样大喊。我们最终走到外面的餐桌旁，很快……我意识到我忘了拿我的午餐。”

"So Asuka, why were you so mad last night?" how the hell did Hikari find out about it? "It was all over the newspaper this morning. 'Crazy Red-Head Tells Of City', 'Pilot Attack', 'That Time Of The Month?'"  
"“所以，明日香，你昨晚为什么那么生气？”光是怎么知道这事的？“今早的报纸上全是这个。‘疯狂红发女郎的城市告白’，‘驾驶员攻击事件’，‘那个月的那几天？’””

"Okay Hikari! We get the point!" Asuka takes a bit of half her sandwich – she gave me the other half – as she finished the sentence, "I swear, girls can't show any emotion without guys blaming it on that!" all the girls at the table nodded, making me, Kensuke and Toji look like asses, "I can guarantee that all three of you would be running down the street screaming 'My balls are bleeding!' if that ever happened to you!" true, true…  
"好了，小光！我们明白了！" 明日香咬了一口她的一半三明治——她给了我另一半——在她结束这句话时，"我发誓，女孩们只要一表现出情感，男生们就会怪到那上面去！" 桌上的所有女孩都点头附和，让我们、健介和冬二显得很尴尬，"我可以保证，如果那种事发生在你们身上，你们三个肯定会满街跑，尖叫着'我的蛋蛋在流血！' 真的，真的……"

"Okay, I really don't need that visualization…" Toji rubs his eyes, obviously disturbed by it.  
"好吧，我真的不需要那个画面……" 冬二揉了揉眼睛，显然被那情景吓到了。

"So, you two are getting kinda friendly, aren't cha'?" ever notice how the only guy at the table without a girlfriend always makes those comments? No? Must be just me then… well, that comment was directed at Rei and Paul, and it didn't end too well for anyone.  
"所以，你们俩变得挺亲密的，不是吗？" 有没有注意到，桌上唯一没有女朋友的男生总是说这种话？没有吗？那可能只是我……好吧，那句话是针对丽和保罗的，结果对谁都没好果子吃。

"Yes, we're friends, why?" Rei SERIOULSY needs help socially…  
"是的，我们是朋友，怎么了？" 丽真的需要在社交上得到帮助……

"Two things here; one – no, we're not dating. Jesus man, we've only known each other for less then a day! And two – who the hell are you?" I have to admit, I like this guy!  
"这里有两件事；第一——不，我们没有在约会。天哪，我们才认识不到一天！第二——你他妈是谁？" 我得承认，我喜欢这家伙！

"He's the odd guy in the group that nobody fuckin' likes, but he sticks around like a lost puppy," whoa! That one had to hurt! "He's Kensuke, I'm Toji, this is Hikari, and you know Asuka and Shinji. Nice to meet you," he reached out and shook Paul's hand… was Toji being… polite? I mean, aside from the whole insulting the hell out of Kensuke part!  
"他是团队里那个没人喜欢的怪人，但他就像一只迷路的小狗一样黏着我们，" 哇！这一句肯定伤到他了！"他是 Kensuke，我是 Toji，这是 Hikari，你认识 Asuka 和 Shinji。很高兴见到你，" 他伸出手和 Paul 握手……Toji 这是在……礼貌吗？我是说，除了那句对 Kensuke 的侮辱之外！

"You know what Toji? Fuck you, I don't need this," Kensuke grabs his lunch and storms off. The entire group was silent, and most of us were glaring at Toji, even Asuka. Now, Kensuke may not be her favorite person, but she likes him to some extent.  
"知道吗，冬二？去你的，我不需要这个，" 真嗣抓起他的午餐，怒气冲冲地离开了。整个小组都沉默了，我们大多数人都在瞪着冬二，就连惣流也不例外。虽然真嗣可能不是她最喜欢的人，但她对他还是有一定好感的。

"Did you have to insult him like that?" despite Paul's dark appearance, he actually fairly nice. He gets up and follows after a fuming Kensuke.  
"你非得那样侮辱他吗？" 尽管保罗看起来很凶，实际上他相当友善。他站起来，跟在怒气未消的真嗣后面。

"You're an ass Toji, speak for yourself next time," whoa! That's even coming from Hikari! She scoots over – away from him – taking Kensuke's seat. Yeah… something tells me that their relationship is over for a little while at least…  
"你真是个混蛋，冬二，下次说话前先想想自己，" 哇！这话居然出自光！她挪到一边——远离他——坐到了真嗣的位置上。是啊……有预感他们的关系暂时结束了……

"Oh come on! I was just joking!"  
"哎呀，别这样！我只是在开玩笑！"

"Who's laughing?" so yeah, pretty much the entire group is pissed at him, even Rei. We all get up – including myself – and sit at the table Kensuke drifted to, leaving Toji to sit by himself. He deserves that too, it's one thing to joke around, which he does a lot, but to go that far was uncalled for.  
"谁在笑？" 所以基本上整个小组都很生他的气，甚至连丽也不例外。我们都站了起来——包括我自己——坐到了健介飘向的桌子旁，留下冬二一个人坐着。他也该受点教训，开玩笑是一回事，他经常这样，但这次做得太过分了。

"Don't worry guys, I'm just trying to teach Toji a lesion, maybe he'll leave me alone from now on," that actually got a smile out of Rei!  
"别担心，伙计们，我只是想给冬二一个教训，也许他以后会离我远点，" 这话居然让丽笑了！

A/N – Sorry guys, I'm writing this at 3 in the morning right now, I know it sucks… I'm trying here! I just have barely any time to write anymore, so I'm taking it wherever I can now.  
作者笔记 – 抱歉各位，我现在是凌晨三点在写这个，我知道很糟糕……我尽力了！我只是几乎没有时间写作了，所以现在我一有机会就写。

Back In Classroom 重返教室

"So in short, the US was built on crappy reality shows and Mad TV," God I hate history…  
“简而言之，美国是建立在糟糕的真人秀和疯狂电视上的，”天啊，我讨厌历史……

"Hey Shinji," Asuka whispers to me to get my attention and hands me a note. Written in red, think ink it read 'if I find a really big rock, will you hit me with it?' I couldn't help but laugh under my breath.  
“嘿，真嗣，”明日香轻声对我说，递给我一张纸条。用红墨水写着：‘如果我找到一块很大的石头，你会用它砸我吗？’我忍不住轻声笑了出来。

'That bored, huh?' and she just responds by pretty much engraving 'YES!' Onto the paper. We went back and forth with this most of the day, talking about random things mostly, but our conversation did drift to Misato at one point. We reminisced about her old parties, how she would start off every morning with one beer, and how much Asuka hated that 'damn bird'. The main thing though that we missed from her is her attitude, she was always in such a good mood – hell, even her voice seemed to be calming. I found out a few new things though – for one, that night that Misato came home drunk, Asuka spoke to her because out of nowhere Misato woke up and made her way into Asuka's room, woke her up and started rambling on. Now, Asuka doesn't know if it's true or not because Misato doesn't remember any of it, but apparently Misato admitted to loving Kaji… a lot. At the time, this got to Asuka quite a bit, which is why she was so sour to Misato for awhile.  
‘这么无聊啊？’她几乎是用笔在纸上刻下‘是的！’作为回应。我们一整天就这样来回传递纸条，大部分时间聊的都是些琐事，但我们的对话确实有一次转向了美里小姐。我们回忆起她以前的派对，她每天早上如何以一罐啤酒开始，以及明日香有多讨厌那只‘该死的鸟’。但我们最怀念的还是她的态度，她总是心情很好——见鬼，甚至连她的声音听起来都让人平静。不过，我也发现了一些新的事情——比如，美里那晚喝醉回家，明日香和她谈过，因为美里突然醒来，走进明日香的房间，叫醒她，开始喋喋不休。现在，明日香不知道这是真是假，因为美里对此毫无记忆，但显然美里承认她非常爱加持……很多。当时，这让明日香很受打击，这也是为什么她有一段时间对美里态度很差。

A/N – The conversation from here on is done in the note-passing session between Asuka and Shinji until I say otherwise.  
A/N – 从这里开始的对话是在 Asuka 和 Shinji 之间的纸条传递环节中进行的，直到我另行说明。

"Hey, do you remember Ritsuko?" class was ending soon, but we might as well continue the conversation. We've gone through at least four pages by now, and Asuka just started a new one.  
“嘿，你还记得 Ritsuko 吗？”课快要结束了，但我们不妨继续聊。到现在为止我们已经传了至少四页纸条了，而 Asuka 刚刚开始写新的一页。

"Of course, why?" “当然记得，怎么了？”

"Dunno, I just got to thinking about her recently. We should go and visit her, how long has it been since we've even seen her?"  
"不知道，我最近就是突然想起了她。我们应该去看看她，我们有多久没见过她了？"

"About a month I think. I don't like being in NERV period anymore, it just has a bad atmosphere now. Ever since the Angels died off, most of the people around NERV just sit around."  
"大概一个月吧。我现在不喜欢待在 NERV 了，那里的氛围变得很糟糕。自从使徒消失后，NERV 周围的人大多都无所事事。"

NERV

"Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!"  
"咕噜！咕噜！咕噜！咕噜！咕噜！"

You know where 你知道在哪里

"True… I know! We need to have another party at Misato's! It'll be like old times! Misato getting piss-eyed drunk, the take-out food, and my favorite part, all the adults on karaoke thinking that they can sing!" oh yeah! Misato once sang 'Dancing Queen'!  
真的……我知道！我们得在美里家再办一次派对！就像以前那样！美里喝得烂醉如泥，外卖食物，还有我最喜欢的部分，所有大人在卡拉 OK 上自以为能唱！哦耶！美里曾经唱过《舞后》呢！

"You want to ask her today after school?"  
你想今天放学后问她吗？

"Sure, we'll stop by there on the way home today," this should be interesting… Misato's going to have to restock on her beer!  
“当然，我们今天回家路上会顺便去那儿，”这应该挺有意思的……美里又要补充她的啤酒库存了！

A/N – Back to speech  
作者注 – 回到对话

"Okay, get the hell out of my classroom, I have to grade your pathetic papers," all talking among ourselves, we make our way out of the room.  
“好吧，给我滚出我的教室，我得批改你们这些糟糕的试卷，”我们互相交谈着，走出了教室。

"So I take it that you two are an item?" Paul walks up next to me, opposite of Asuka, "You guys were passing notes the entire class. If you're not dating, you really should!"  
"所以，我猜你们俩是一对儿？" 保罗走到我旁边，对面是明日香，"你们整节课都在传纸条。如果不是在约会，那真的应该考虑一下！"

"You're just now noticing? What gave us away? Kissing before lunch ended? Holding hands? Sitting next to each other? Which was it?" most people would take offence to her sarcasm, but Paul actually laughed at it, "Okay, you're either sucking up because you want something or you're actually pretty cool. Which is it?"  
"你现在才注意到吗？是什么让我们露馅的？午餐结束前的亲吻？牵手？还是坐在一起？到底是哪个？" 大多数人可能会对她的讽刺感到不悦，但保罗却真的笑了，"好吧，你不是在讨好我，就是真的挺酷的。到底是哪个？"

"Well, I'm not sucking up, sooooo…"  
"嗯，我可不是在讨好你，所以……"

"Okay then, I like you! Tell me something though…" okay, that tone in her voice didn't sound too good, "Do you like Rei?"  
"好吧，我喜欢你！不过你得告诉我一件事……" 好吧，她那语气听起来不太妙，"你喜欢丽吗？"

"Not this again… no, we're not dating, why do you guys keep on asking?" who could blame us for wondering? The fact that they're spending a lot of time together on top of… well, to put it bluntly, we all put a bet on how long it would take Rei to get a boyfriend, and so far I'm winning.  
"又来这一套……不，我们没在交往，你们怎么老问这个？" 谁会怪我们好奇呢？他们花很多时间在一起，再加上……呃，直白点说，我们都赌丽多久能交到男朋友，目前为止我领先。

"I didn't ask if you were dating, now did I?" good point…  
"我可没问你们是不是在交往，对吧？" 说得有理……

"Okay then; no, I don't. She's a good friend, but as of right now, I wouldn't date her. I barely know her!" as of right now? Hm… I might be getting some money soon…  
"好吧，那么；不，我不喜欢她。她是个好朋友，但就目前而言，我不会和她约会。我几乎不了解她！" 就目前而言？嗯……我可能很快会有些钱……

"Okay, okay, don't get all angry, I was just curious… oh, by the way, she's warming up to you pretty quickly compared to other people… I'm just sayin'," Paul gets that annoyed face on again, just in time for Rei to come walking up next to him… great timing! "Well speak of the devil!"  
"好了，好了，别生气，我只是好奇……哦，顺便说一句，她对你比对其他人更快热络起来……我只是说说而已，" 保罗又露出了那副恼怒的表情，正好这时丽走到了他身边……时机真好！"真是说曹操，曹操到！"

"I'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from calling me that."  
"如果你能避免那样称呼我，我会很感激。"

"I wasn't calling you anything, it's an expression. You know, like 'two peas in a pod'," nice set-up!  
"我没说你什么，这只是个表达方式。你知道的，就像‘两个豆荚里的豌豆’，挺好的铺垫！

"Anyway, me and Asuka were going down to Misato's to see if she wanted to have another get-together, if she says yes, do you want to come?" I don't know why, but this guy really is getting into our group fairly quickly.  
"总之，我和明日香打算去美里那儿看看她是否还想再聚一次，如果她同意，你想来吗？"我不知道为什么，但这家伙真的很快融入了我们的小团体。

"Um… sure, but I'll have to meet her first! My dad will probably want to meet her too, he's one of those protective types," ah crap… we'll have to get her sober…  
"嗯…当然可以，但我得先见见她！我爸可能也想见见她，他是那种保护欲很强的人，"啊糟糕…我们得让她清醒过来…

"Yeah, he doesn't have to worry about anything. While she can be a party girl, she's plenty responsible," CAN be? "Okay, this is our turn, we'll meet you at home Rei," with a wave, we break off from the line and walk towards the apartment complex. Soon enough, we were up the stares and staring at that painfully familiar white door. "So… you gonna knock or what?" why do I have to be the one to do it?  
"是啊，他什么都不用担心。虽然她有时爱玩，但绝对负责任，"有时？"好了，我们该转弯了，家里见，丽。"我们挥手告别队伍，走向公寓楼。很快，我们上了楼梯，面对着那扇令人痛苦地熟悉的白色门。"那么……你要敲门还是怎样？"为什么非得是我来敲门？

"It was your idea, why don't you?" I think we both knew why we didn't want to knock. A certain man's car was parked next to Misato's, and they were either talking or… yeah, they weren't talking. Asuka uses those bright blue eyes to her advantage once again, and with a single bat of those eyelashes, I was knocking, "Hey Misato?" we hear a large crash from inside the house, and a few minutes later the door swings open to show Misato in a very loose fitting, long t-shirt and… well, it was so long she could have had nothing underneath and we wouldn't have known.  
"这是你的主意，为什么不是你？"我想我们都明白为什么不想敲门。某人的车停在 Misato 旁边，他们要么在交谈，要么……没错，他们没在交谈。Asuka 再次利用她那双明亮的蓝眼睛，轻轻一眨眼，我就敲了门，"嘿，Misato？"屋内传来一声巨响，几分钟后门猛地打开，Misato 穿着一件非常宽松的长 T 恤，而且……嗯，T 恤太长，她可能什么都没穿，我们也不会知道。

"Shinji? Asuka? What are you doing here?" the better question is what is she doing in there?  
"真嗣？明日香？你们在这里做什么？"更好的问题是她在里面做什么？

"We wanted to talk to you about something, but if you're busy…"  
"我们有事想和你谈谈，不过如果你忙的话……"

"No, no, come on in! I was just sitting down with Kaji for some lunch, you want some? I made chicken!" so they weren't having sex? Then what was that crash?!  
"不，不，进来吧！我正和 Kaji 坐下来吃午饭呢，你们要不要来点？我做了鸡肉！" 他们没在做什么？那刚才那声巨响是什么？！

"No thanks," we both say in unison with some accent on the 'no'. As we walk in, we see Kaji – in his normal button-up shirt – poking his fork at an extremely burnt piece of chicken. As for what piece of the chicken it was… you got me there.  
"不用了，谢谢，" 我们异口同声地说，特别强调了那个'不'字。走进去时，我们看到 Kaji——穿着他平常的扣衫——正用叉子戳着一块烧得焦黑的鸡肉。至于那块鸡肉是哪一部分的……这我可就说不准了。

"Oh, hey kids," while that's what it sounded like, his lips seemed to have said 'help me'.  
"哦，嘿，孩子们，" 虽然听起来是这样，但他的嘴唇似乎说的是'救救我'。

"Hey Kaji," okay, I know that Asuka doesn't flirt with him anymore, but she always gets this tone in her voice when she's around him.  
"嘿，Kaji，" 好吧，我知道明日香不再对他调情了，但她每次在他身边时，声音里总带着这种语调。

"So, what did you want to talk about?" I get a slight glimpse of a familiar black tail before it disappears into the hallway.  
"那么，你想谈些什么呢？" 我瞥见一条熟悉的黑色尾巴，随即它消失在走廊里。

"Well, it's been awhile since we've gotten together, and we were wondering if you want to have another party," she instantly gets a smile at my suggestion.  
"嗯，我们有一阵子没聚了，不知道你有没有兴趣再办个派对？" 她一听我的提议，立刻露出了笑容。

"That sounds great! You're right, it has been quite awhile since we've gotten the old group together. So, how many people do you think are coming? I gotta know how much food to order," oh thank god! She's not cooking!  
"听起来很棒！你说得对，确实很久没把老朋友们聚在一起了。那你觉得会有多少人来？我得知道订多少食物。" 哦，谢天谢地！她不打算自己做饭！

"Well, there's me, Shinji, Rei, Kensuke, Hikari, Paul, you and Kaji, Ritsuko if she comes this time, and… I think that's it, right? So that's nine people," notice how Asuka didn't even bother to mention Toji? Yeah, she's really pissed at him.  
"嗯，有我、真嗣、绫波、剑介、光、保罗、你和加持，如果律子这次也来的话，还有……我想就这些了吧？总共九个人。" 注意到明日香连提都没提真治吗？没错，她对他真的很生气。

"Yeah, that sounds about right. So, is tomorrow okay?" oh yeah, it's Saturday! It wasn't much of a week for us, so it flew by!  
“是啊，听起来挺对的。那，明天可以吗？”哦对，今天是周六！对我们来说这周没啥特别的，所以一晃就过去了！

"Yeah, that sounds great. We'll call up everyone when we get home… okay, I'm just curious, what was that crash?" both Misato and Kaji smirk at each other, "Actually, I don't want to know…"  
“是啊，听起来不错。我们回家后给大伙儿打电话……好吧，我只是好奇，刚才那声巨响是什么？”Misato 和 Kaji 相视一笑，“其实，我不想知道……”

That Night – Rei's Apartment – 9:30 PM  
当晚 – 绫波的公寓 – 晚上 9:30

Today was long as hell to say the least, and I just couldn't wait to crawl into bed… but of course, things are never that easy. When we finally got a chance to sit down and relax at around five, we turn on the TV only to find that the cable had been disconnected, which took us about forty minutes of me screwing around with the wiring to realize. Next, I decided to start on dinner, which turned out like crap because Rei failed to tell me that her stove is broken… can you say fire hazard? Well, after awhile we just decided to go to bed a little early… hell, even that didn't work out. Rei fell asleep almost instantly, but Asuka was tossing and turning until 10:00 PM. At that point I decided to just invite her into my bed, which was extremely awkward, but she answered with a cute 'Sure'. We both fell asleep pretty much instantly after that, but we both knew if we were ever caught like this we'd be in some deep shit. Honestly though, I doubt she cared – I didn't – because what's the worst thing they'll do? NERV is too cheap to buy a separate house, the only thing they'd do is tell us not to do it again. That night ended pretty well, even if it was only a few moments long.  
今天真是漫长得要命，说白了，我简直迫不及待想爬上床……但当然，事情从没那么简单。我们终于有机会在五点左右坐下来放松一下，打开电视却发现有线电视被切断了，我折腾了大约四十分钟的线路才意识到这一点。接着，我决定开始做晚饭，结果搞得一团糟，因为丽没告诉我她的炉子坏了……你能说这是火灾隐患吗？好吧，过了一会儿我们决定早点上床睡觉……见鬼，连这也行不通。丽几乎立刻就睡着了，但明日香辗转反侧直到晚上十点。那时我决定邀请她来我的床上，虽然非常尴尬，但她用一个可爱的“当然”回答了我。之后我们俩几乎立刻就睡着了，但我们俩都知道，如果被发现这样，我们会惹上大麻烦。不过说实话，我怀疑她不在乎——我也不在乎——因为最糟糕的情况能怎样？NERV 太抠门，不会给我们另买房子，他们唯一能做的就是告诉我们别再这么做了。那一夜结束得相当不错，即使只有短短几刻。

"I love you Shinji." "我喜欢你，真嗣。"

A/N – Okay, I think this is starting to drift towards a romance/drama again… I gotta fix that… anyway, back to the story. You're all going to get quite a surprise when Paul's father makes an appearance (coughcoughdonaldtrumpcoughcough). So, looks like Shinji and Asuka's relationship is starting to blossom more and more, but how far will it reach? Will they make a mistake or learn control? Find out in the next chapter; Admitting, Proposing, And A Little Karaoke, until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记 – 好吧，我觉得这又开始偏向浪漫/戏剧了…我得调整一下…总之，回到故事。当保罗的父亲出现时（咳咳，唐纳德·特朗普，咳咳），你们都会大吃一惊。看来真嗣和明日香的关系正在越来越亲密，但会发展到什么程度呢？他们会犯错还是学会控制？下一章chapter《承认、求婚与一点卡拉 OK》中揭晓，在此之前，继续加油吧！

A/A/N – Well, I have a new fic out called Walk A Mile, based off of Nothing Will Ever Change That. It shows climaxes in the story, written from a different point of view. The first chapter is first person with Dietlinde during her… well, 'first date'. You'll see what I mean! For some reason it's not showing up on the list when I search it, but you can just go to my profile (just click on my penname) and then click on Walk A Mile.  
作者/作者/笔记 – 嗯，我有一篇新同人小说《走一英里》，基于《没有什么能改变这一点》。它展示了故事中的高潮，从不同的视角书写。第一章chapter是以迪特尔林德在她的…呃，‘第一次约会’期间的视角。你会明白我的意思的！不知为何，当我搜索时它没有出现在列表中，但你可以直接访问我的个人资料（只需点击我的笔名），然后点击《走一英里》。

###  Chapter 17: Decision

A/N – Newly revised chapters! Changed the plot, so I had to delete a few pages… okay, more like 50, but whatever.  
作者注 – 新修订的章节！修改了剧情，所以不得不删掉几页……好吧，其实是 50 页，但无所谓了。

That Morning – 10:00 AM  
那天早晨 – 上午 10:00

"Hey Shinji…" going against the grain for once, I was waken up gently, and not rushed, "It's getting a little late, we should get up," we were laying next to each other, both on our side, with out bodies presses close together. I've heard Asuka call it 'spooning' once, but I've never heard that before, so I wasn't too sure.  
“嘿，真嗣……”这次我反常地被温柔唤醒，而不是急匆匆地，“时间有点晚了，我们该起床了，”我们并排躺着，身体紧贴在一起。我曾听明日香提过一次‘抱团取暖’这个词，但我之前从未听过，所以不太确定。

"Do we have to get up so early?"  
"我们非得这么早起床吗？"

"Well… kinda… see, I sorta promised Rei that we'd be out of the apartment by ten-thirty because she wanted to spend some time alone… so yeah, get dressed, I've got a surprise for you!" I have to admit, that did make me prepare myself a little faster, but not by much. It was ten on a Sunday morning, all I wanted to do was go back to sleep! I did, however, get dressed in the bathroom as Asuka was dressing in the room. Making sure to ask before I walked out this time, I saw her in a slightly rare outfit; tight jeans with an equally tight red t-shirt, where the sleeves were cut off right before the shoulder, almost making it a tank-top. As we walked out of the apartment, something hit me.  
"嗯……算是吧……你看，我答应了丽我们会在十点半之前离开公寓，因为她想一个人待会儿……所以，快穿衣服，我有个惊喜给你！"" 不得不说，这确实让我准备得快了些，但也没快多少。那是个周日的早上十点，我只想回去睡觉！不过，我还是去浴室穿了衣服，而明日香在房间里换衣服。这次我确保先问了一声再走出去，看到她穿着一件略显罕见的衣服；紧身牛仔裤配同样紧身的红色 T 恤，袖子在肩部前被剪掉，几乎成了件背心。当我们走出公寓时，我突然想到一个问题。

"Hey… where IS Rei? I didn't see her anywhere."  
"嘿……丽在哪儿？我哪儿都没看到她。"

"Oh, she's at Paul's house, his dad was going over to meet Misato, and Paul wanted her to tag along. As for why she wanted the apartment to herself… use your imagination," Asuka simply winks at me, and I get a nasty mental image, "You know, Rei doesn't look it, but she's a serious metal head! I was looking through her stuff, and I found Slipknot, Cradle Of Filth, Disturbed, Iron Maiden, Rammstein, and about twenty other CD's!" okay, that's just weird right there!  
"哦，她在保罗家，他爸爸要去见美里，保罗想让她一起去。至于她为什么想要独占公寓……发挥你的想象力，" 明日香对我眨了眨眼，我脑海中浮现出一些糟糕的画面，"你知道吗，绫波看起来不像，但她是个真正的金属头！我翻了她的东西，发现了 Slipknot、Cradle Of Filth、Disturbed、Iron Maiden、Rammstein，还有大约二十张其他 CD！" 好吧，这真是太奇怪了！

"Wow… that's just… actually, that's kind of hoooo…" I catch myself before I say something stupid, "Hoooo… rse…"  
"哇……这真是……实际上，这有点……呼……" 我及时打住，没说出什么蠢话，"呼……马……"

"That's kind of horse?" "有点像马？"

"Yeah, so?" Asuka just looks up at me with a smile that says 'you're an idiot', "Anyway, where are we going?"  
"是啊，那又怎样？" 明日香只是抬头看着我，脸上挂着那种'你真是个傻瓜'的笑容，"话说回来，我们要去哪儿？"

"It's not where we're going right now, but more of a surprise for later," I just look at her with a raised eyebrow, "_Warte doch, warte doch,_" okay, while I would never say it to her face, it's kind of sexy when she's talking in another language, even if I have no idea what she just said.  
"现在不是我们要去的地方，而是一个稍后的惊喜，" 我挑了挑眉毛看着她，"稍等，稍等，" 好吧，虽然我绝不会当面告诉她，但她用另一种语言说话时，那种感觉还挺性感的，尽管我完全不知道她刚才说了什么。"

"You know I hate it when you play word games!"  
"你知道我不喜欢你玩文字游戏！"

"Yep, I sure do!" she laces her fingers in along with mine, "So, winter break is coming up pretty soon, you want to do anything in particular?"  
"当然，我确实想！" 她将手指与我的交缠在一起，"所以，寒假马上就要到了，你有什么特别想做的事吗？"

"Actually no, you know how much I hate the cold," even if it only gets as low as sixty degrees F, I've just never been accustomed to it, "Unless you want to do something," she rolls her eyes and reaches in her pocket, throwing out what looked like a brochure into a passing trashcan.  
"其实没有，你知道我有多讨厌寒冷，" 即使温度只降到六十华氏度，我也从未习惯过，"除非你想做点什么，" 她翻了个白眼，伸手从口袋里掏出一样东西，扔进路过的垃圾桶，看起来像是一本小册子。"

"Well not anymore. C'mon Shinji, we have to find something to do – I'll die with a week of nothing to do!" while she may have been right, I really don't mind some down time. Unlike her, I couldn't miss the Evas less, and now that our worlds don't revolve around them, it's nice not to be obligated to anything.  
"好吧，现在不了。来吧，真嗣，我们得找点事情做——我可不想在一周无所事事中死去！" 虽然她可能是对的，但我真的不介意有些空闲时间。与她不同，我一点也不想念 EVA，现在我们的世界不再围绕它们转，不必承担任何义务的感觉真好。"

"I'm sure we'll find something to do… speaking of, where are we going?"  
"我确信我们会找到事情做的……对了，我们要去哪儿？"  
"I just wanna show you something," our fast pace eventually calms down to a slow stroll, just enjoying the busy city air and each other's company. Our semi-long walk found us tracing the shore of the lake, slowly making our way towards the north side of it. When we were almost directly across from NERV, we ran into an old rusted out, vein-covered fence.  
"我只是想给你看些东西，""我们的步伐逐渐放缓，变成悠闲的漫步，享受着繁忙都市的气息和彼此的陪伴。我们半长的步行让我们沿着湖岸前行，缓缓向北岸走去。当我们几乎正对着 NERV 时，遇到了一堵老旧生锈、布满藤蔓的围栏。"

"Um… did you make a wrong turn?" she just chuckles as she lets go of my hand and makes her way over the fence.  
"呃……你是不是走错路了？""她只是轻笑一声，松开我的手，径直越过了围栏。"

"Come on, we're almost there, follow me," just shrugging off my confused thoughts, I follow her over the fence, almost ripping my jeans. We made our way up hill, walking towards the left of where we hopped the fence, through a slightly dense forest. Just when my heart rate was starting to rise, the forest abruptly ends, leaving us on a high hill, over looking the lake in the direction at which the sun rose. While the sun wasn't exactly on the horizon, it made quite the effect on the below water. The grass on this hill was at least three inches thick, with spotted clusters of dandelions everywhere, "This is where I would go when I just wanted to be alone when people would piss me off."  
"快点，我们快到了，跟我来，" 我甩开困惑的思绪，跟着她翻过栅栏，差点撕破了牛仔裤。我们沿着山坡向上走，穿过我们翻越栅栏左侧的一片略显茂密的森林。就在我的心跳开始加速时，森林突然结束，我们站在高高的山丘上，俯瞰着朝阳升起的方向的湖泊。虽然太阳并未完全在地平线上，但它对下方水面产生了相当壮观的效果。这片山丘上的草至少有三英寸厚，到处点缀着蒲公英的簇簇花团，"这是我想要独处时，当人们惹恼我时会来的地方。"

"How the hell did you find this place?" she lays back onto the grass, kneeling up with her elbows. Her left leg was straight while her right was bent to support the rest of her body weight  
"你到底是怎么找到这个地方的？" 她向后躺在草地上，双肘撑地跪坐着。她的左腿伸直，右腿弯曲以支撑身体的其余部分重量

"One day after our pilot training I was bored and just stumbled onto it. Come on, lay down, its comfortable," I take my place next to her, staring out into the lake, "You know, one night I fell asleep here. Gendo was SSSOOOO pissed at me when I came back!" feeling uncomfortable, we both lay back fully onto the grass; my hands behind my head and Asuka's on her stomach.  
“有一天，我们的飞行员训练结束后，我无聊就偶然发现了这里。来吧，躺下，这里很舒服。”我躺到她旁边，望着湖面，“你知道吗，有天晚上我在这里睡着了。回来时，碇真嗣简直气炸了！”我们俩都觉得有点不自在，于是完全躺倒在草地上；我的手枕在头下，而明日香的手放在肚子上。

"Well I have to admit, this is nice. We should come out here more often," even the air seemed cleaner to me, just everything about this place is better then in the city. We spent half an hour there, just talking, recalling past events, feelings, and a few stories about before our meeting. After what seemed like a few minutes, in reality thirty, Asuka adjusted herself so her head was lying on my chest and her hand gently rested on my stomach. The conversations died, our bodies rested, and we eventually found ourselves sleeping in the warm morning sun.  
“好吧，我得承认，这里真不错。我们应该常来。”空气似乎都更清新了，这个地方的一切都比城市里好。我们在那里待了半个小时，只是聊天，回忆过去的事情，分享感受，还有几个我们相遇之前的故事。感觉只过了几分钟，实际上是三十分钟，明日香调整了一下姿势，头枕在我的胸口，手轻轻地放在我的肚子上。谈话声渐渐消失，我们的身体放松下来，最终在温暖的晨光中睡着了。

3:00 PM 下午 3:00

I was gently woken up after what I thought was a short-lived nap by Asuka kneeing my leg, apparently moving from a dream she was having at the time. She was still in the exact same position she was when we fell asleep, only now her left leg was thrown across my hips, which is what I think woke me up. Trying to move slowly, I take my arms from behind my head, wrapping one around her shoulders and one resting on top of her hand on my stomach.  
我在短暂的小憩后被明日香用膝盖顶了下腿，轻轻地唤醒了，显然她是从当时的梦境中移动过来的。她依然保持着我们入睡时的姿势，只是现在她的左腿横跨在我的臀部上，我想这就是唤醒我的原因。我试图缓慢移动，将手臂从脑后抽出，一只环绕在她的肩膀上，另一只则搭在她放在我肚子上的手上。

"Asuka…" rubbing her hand with mine, I wake her up slowly, "We should be getting up, Rei's probably looking for us," she opens her eyes and looks up at me with them half open.  
“明日香…”我用我的手摩擦着她的手，慢慢地唤醒她，“我们该起床了，丽可能正在找我们。”她睁开眼睛，半睁着眼睛抬头看着我。

"Huh…?" she uses her hand to rub her eyes, "Oh… how long were we asleep?" I look at my watch and just chuckle, "What?"  
“嗯…？”她用手揉了揉眼睛，“哦…我们睡了多久？”我看了一眼手表，只是轻笑了一声，“什么？”

"Almost four hours," she lets out a soft laugh too, "I told you to let me go back to sleep at Rei's," I get up and help her to her feet, "We should head back home, let's go," and we did just that. Oddly enough, the walk home seemed slightly faster then actually getting to that hill, though I wish it hadn't. I enjoyed this time alone with Asuka, even if we were asleep for most of it.  
“快四个小时了，”她也轻声笑了出来，“我告诉过你让我回丽那里继续睡的，”我起身扶她站起来，“我们该回家了，走吧，”我们确实就这么做了。奇怪的是，回家的路似乎比去那座小山还要快些，尽管我希望它没有。我喜欢和明日香独处的这段时光，即使我们大部分时间都在睡觉。

8:00 PM – Outside of Misato's  
晚上 8 点 – 在美里家外

"Don't you find it a little odd that Rei never left Misato's after going there with Paul? I mean, she's been there literally all day," getting ready for this little get together took us quite awhile between Asuka trying to find something to wear and actually putting it on… she ended up going in her sun-dress, just like I offered at the very beginning. I went casual, just wearing a black shirt and an unbuttoned black over shirt with jeans.  
“你不觉得丽跟保罗去美里家后就没离开有点奇怪吗？我是说，她几乎一整天都在那里，”为了这个小聚会，我们花了好长时间准备，期间明日香一直在找合适的衣服，最后还是穿上了我一开始就建议的太阳裙。我则随意些，只穿了件黑色衬衫和一件解开扣子的黑色外套，搭配牛仔裤。

"Yeah, lil' bit, but whatever, she needs to socialize more anyway," have to admit, she's right. Asuka knocked on the door, summoning our former guardian – already slightly buzzed – to the door.  
“是啊，小家伙，但无所谓，反正她也需要多社交。”不得不承认，她说得对。明日香敲了敲门，召唤我们曾经的监护人——已经有点微醺——来开门。

"Shinji! Asuka! About time you got here! Where you been?" she had a half empty beer in her hand, proving my point.  
“真嗣！明日香！你们终于来了！去哪儿了？”她手里拿着半空的啤酒，证实了我的猜测。

"Sorry, we ran a little late," she invites us in and we see that only Kaji, Paul and Rei were there, waiting for the other guests to show up, "Hey, Asuka," I nudge her and whisper within earshot of her alone, "Look at Rei and Paul," the two children were sitting at the table, talking away and obviously have a great time. Whether he knew it or not, Paul had gotten more smiles out of Rei in the past two days then we have in the past year.  
“抱歉，我们稍微迟到了一点，”她邀请我们进去，我们看到只有加持、保罗和绫波在场，等待其他客人到来，“嘿，明日香，”我轻轻推了她一下，在她耳边低语，“看绫波和保罗。”两个孩子坐在桌旁，聊得正欢，显然玩得很开心。不管他知不知道，保罗在过去的两天里让绫波笑得比我们过去一年加起来还多。

"Take a seat, Hikari will be here soon, but I don't know about Kensuke," we do as we were told and take our seat next to Kaji, across the table from the, what we all imagined, future couple.  
“坐下吧，光很快就会到，但我不确定健介会不会来，”我们照吩咐坐在了加持旁边，对面是我们所有人想象中的未来情侣。

"Oh, hello," Rei averted her stare from Paul to greet us, "Where were you? I called Ikari's phone nine times, you never picked up," me and Asuka smirked at each other.  
“哦，你们好，”丽从保罗身上移开目光，向我们打招呼，“你们去哪儿了？我给碇打了九次电话，你们都没接，”我和明日香相视而笑。

"We… lost track of time…"  
“我们……忘了时间……”

"Oooo! So the young couple's having a little fun, eh?" Kaji elbowed me in the upper arm, winking, "Just remember: wrap it up!" Misato first glares at Kaji, then at me.  
"哦哦！看来这对小情侣玩得挺开心啊？" 加持用肘轻推我的上臂，眨眼道，"别忘了：包好它！" 美里先是瞪了加持一眼，然后又瞪向我。

"Kaji, don't give a fourteen year old tips on how to have sex! And Shinji, you ever try something like that I'll beat your ass!" you know, I really do believe she would! Not even for the fact that we had sex, but just because I wouldn't tell her!  
"加持，别给一个十四岁的孩子传授性知识！还有真嗣，你要是敢那么做，我绝对会揍你一顿！" 你知道吗，我真的相信她会这么做！不是因为我们发生了关系，而是因为我没告诉她！

"Well then get your shoe ready…" ASUKA! "Why do you think we were late?" Kaji then proceeds to cough on the beer he was drinking, spitting it halfway across the room.  
"那你就准备好鞋子吧……" 明日香！ "你以为我们为什么会迟到？" 加持随后被啤酒呛到，一半的啤酒喷到了房间的另一边。

"NO! She's joking! Right Asuka? Tell them!"  
"不！她在开玩笑！对吧，明日香？告诉他们！"

"Whoa Shinji… nice…" and with that, Rei glared at Paul, "What?" She continues the glare, "Oh come on, it was a joke!"  
"哇，真嗣…不错…"" 接着，绫波瞪了保罗一眼，""什么？"" 她继续瞪着，""哦，拜托，那只是个玩笑！"

"No jokes," damn! Rei's got him in check!  
"不开玩笑，""该死！绫波把他制住了！"

"Ugh, fine, I was lying… but you can still kick him if you want Misato," what did I do wrong?!  
"唉，好吧，我是在撒谎……但如果你想的话，你还是可以踢他，美里，"我做错了什么？！

--

9:00 PM – Same Place  
晚上 9 点 – 同一地点

"It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder. You're bundled up now, wait till you get older," Misato was singing a song that I haven't heard in my entire life, and for once, it really wasn't that bad. By now, Rei and Paul have given up on trying to hide their affection, and they were off in a corner sitting together, her head resting on his shoulder. I have to admit, I've never seen a guy blush like that before! Kaji was speaking with Kensuke back at the table, while Hikari was preparing something to eat. Asuka and I were on the sofa just relaxing, watching everyone around us.  
"这是个凉爽的地方，他们说还会更冷。你现在裹得严实，等年纪大了就知道，"美里唱着一首我这辈子从未听过的歌，但这次，真的没那么糟糕。此时，丽和保罗已经放弃了隐藏他们的感情，他们在角落里坐在一起，她的头靠在他的肩上。我得承认，我从没见过一个男人脸红成那样！加持正和真嗣在桌边交谈，而光子在准备食物。我和明日香坐在沙发上，只是放松地看着周围的人。

"Told you Paul and Rei were gonna get together. They're a cute couple, huh?" I had to admit, she was right.  
"早就跟你说过保罗和丽会在一起的。他们真是一对可爱的情侣，对吧？" 我不得不承认，她是对的。

"Yeah, I guess. He's a little odd if you ask me though… but hey, at least they're happy together."  
"是啊，我想是的。不过如果你问我，他有点古怪……但嘿，至少他们在一起很幸福。"

"Oh wow… would you look at that?" Kensuke and Hikari have both drifted to their own separate corner, obviously in deep conversation, "I thought she hated him!"  
"哦哇……你看看那儿？" 健介和光都各自飘到了角落，显然在深入交谈，"我以为她讨厌他呢！"

"Well, she doesn't really HATE anyone… I mean, I see them flirting every now and then at school, but I doubt it'll ever take off. I can't believe you haven't seen them like this yet," come to think of it, they do kind of keep their relationship under wraps…  
"嗯，她其实并不真正讨厌任何人……我是说，我偶尔在学校看到他们调情，但我怀疑这关系能否发展起来。真不敢相信你还没见过他们这样，"想想看，他们的确有点把关系藏着掖着……

"Sinji, ghet me anoter can," Misato, now lying down in the middle of the room, yells my way. Before I could respond, Kaji cuts in.  
"真嗣，再给我拿一罐，"美里现在躺在房间中央，朝我喊道。我还没来得及回应，加持就插话了。

"Misato, you've had enough," he picks her up, causing her to giggle slightly, and carries her off to the master bedroom, "I swear, that woman will be the death of me…" he takes a seat next to me as Asuka sent a glare his way that he obviously missed.  
"美里，你已经喝得够多了，"他把她扶起来，让她轻声笑了起来，然后把她抱进主卧室，"我发誓，那个女人会要了我的命……"他坐到我旁边，而明日香瞪了他一眼，显然他没注意到。

"Sorry to interrupt your flirting Asuka," or not, "You know what I'm talking about Shinji, aggressive women are crazy, aren't they?"  
"抱歉打扰你调情了，明日香，"或者说，"你知道我在说什么，真嗣，强势的女人都很疯狂，不是吗？"

"And what's that supposed to mean?!" here we go again…  
"那是什么意思？！"又来了……"

"Hey, I didn't say that it was a bad thing, did I? And plus, from what I remember a certain German girl was crazy about me not too long ago… you know who I'm talking about Asuka?" she immediately turns beat-red, "See Shinji? All you have to do is embarrass them!" with a huff, Asuka gets up and retreats into the bathroom, "That was too easy. Now, I need to speak with you.  
"嘿，我可没说这是件坏事，对吧？而且，据我所知，不久前某个德国女孩还对我痴迷不已……你知道我在说谁，明日香？"她立刻脸红得像熟透的苹果，"看吧，真嗣？你只需要让他们难堪就行了！"明日香哼了一声，起身躲进了浴室，"太简单了。现在，我有话要跟你说。"

"Me? About what?" thanks a lot Kaji, I have to go home with her like this now.  
"我？关于什么？" 多谢了，Kaji，我现在得这样和她一起回家了。

"Well, you know that Paul kid? I found something out about him today… his father isn't exactly the ideal parent. Turns out he looks like Paul Allender for a reason, it's his father," how to all these people know who he is?! "Okay, you obviously don't know who he is. He's the guitarist for Cradle Of Filth, twenty-three years running. On top of that, he's the co-owner of Vomitorium, which is a dark art industry. Now, I'm not saying that Paul Jr. over there is as wild as his father, but you know that some of his father's traits came off on him. Just keep an eye on Rei, okay?" so his father is in a rock band, big deal.  
"嗯，你认识那个叫 Paul 的孩子吗？我今天发现了一些关于他的事情……他父亲并不是理想中的家长。原来他长得像 Paul Allender 是有原因的，那是他父亲，" 这些人怎么都知道他是谁？！ "好吧，你显然不知道他是谁。他是 Cradle Of Filth 乐队的吉他手，已经二十三年了。除此之外，他还是 Vomitorium 的共同所有者，那是一个黑暗艺术行业。我不是说 Paul Jr.那小子像他父亲那样狂野，但你知道，他父亲的一些特质确实传给了他。就多留意一下 Rei，好吗？" 所以他父亲是个摇滚乐队成员，有什么大不了的。

"Okay, but I don't really see the issue. He seems calm enough."  
"好吧，但我没看出有什么问题。他看起来挺平静的。"

"I'm just saying watch out. Listen, I'm gonna head in to bed, turn off the lights when you leave, okay?" with a single wave, he disappears into Misato's room. Soon after, Asuka leaves the bathroom just as the doorbell rang. I get up and answer it to be met with a very tall, muscular man with black hair down to his mid back.  
"我只是提醒你小心点。听着，我要去睡觉了，你走的时候把灯关了，好吗？" 他挥了挥手，消失在美里房间里。不久后，明日香从浴室出来，正好门铃响了。我起身开门，迎面是一个非常高大、肌肉发达的男人，黑发垂至中背。

"I'm here to pick up Paul, he needs to get home," he had an English accent, and it was actually pretty creepy at how low it was.  
"我是来接保罗的，他需要回家，" 他说话带有英国口音，实际上相当低沉，令人毛骨悚然。

"Uh… yeah, sure," I turn around to see Paul already on his feet and Rei wide eyed, staring at the man in the doorway.  
"呃…好的，当然，" 我转过身，看到保罗已经站了起来，丽则睁大眼睛，盯着门口的男人。

"Dad, I told you I'd be home by ten, why are you picking me up already?" oh, that that's his dad! A small smirk crossed his face before once again speaking.  
"爸，我跟你说过我会十点前回家的，你怎么现在就来接我了？" 哦，那是他爸爸！他脸上掠过一丝得意的微笑，随即再次开口。

"So this is the famous Rei I've heard so much about," without missing a beat, he walks across the room and shakes Rei's hand, "Nice to finally meet you. I take it my son has already began dating you?"  
"原来这就是传说中的丽，久仰大名，" 他毫不犹豫地穿过房间，与丽握手，"很高兴终于见到你。我猜我儿子已经开始和你约会了？"

"_Dad!_" Paul cuts into speaking English, "_Did you have to tell her that?! And plus, we only started this tonight!_"  
"爸！" 保罗用英语打断道，"你非得告诉她这个吗？！而且，我们今晚才刚开始！"

"_I… can speak English…_" Rei's eyes were still glued to Paul Sr.'s face.  
"我…会说英语…" 丽的眼依旧紧盯着保罗·Sr.的脸。

"_Smart too! And on top of that, I heard you were a Cradle fan! Nice to hear it! I approve,_" letting out a deep, loud laugh, he begins to walk out of the apartment, "Come on Paul, time to go home."  
"还很聪明！而且，我听说你是 Cradle 的粉丝！很好，我喜欢！" 他发出深沉响亮的笑声，开始走出公寓，"来吧，保罗，该回家了。"

"Ugh… bye Rei," obviously embarrassed, Paul Jr. rushes after his father.  
"呃…再见，丽，" 显然感到尴尬，保罗·Jr.急忙跟上他父亲。

"That's… his father…? You've got to be joking…"  
"那……是他父亲……？你一定是在开玩笑吧……"

1:00 AM – Rei's Apartment  
凌晨 1:00 – 丽住的公寓

Rei has long since fallen asleep, and silence broke through the dark air about an hour ago, and yet Rei was still the only one asleep. After she faded away, Asuka and I spoke for quite awhile, and literally out of nowhere we stopped. Once our eyes locked, that was it; there was barely enough light shining in through the small window to see anything, but it was enough for the both of us. About ten minutes ago, I summed up enough courage to make a move towards Asuka, and I switch from my bed into hers… she didn't deny it. We were both under the sheets, and still a single word has yet to be said – we were just staring at each other, letting out the occasional small smile. Our fingers were randomly enlaced beneath the sheets, resting between us… this is literally what I live for. Honestly, for me, what else is there?  
丽早已入睡，大约一小时前，黑暗的空气中便已打破沉默，然而丽仍是唯一睡着的人。在她消失后，我和明日香聊了很久，然后突然间我们就不说话了。一旦我们的目光交汇，就再无言语；透过小窗户射进来的光线微弱到几乎看不见任何东西，但对我们两人来说已经足够。大约十分钟前，我鼓起勇气向明日香靠近，从我的床挪到她的床上……她没有拒绝。我们俩都裹在被子下，仍然没有说出一个字——我们只是凝视着对方，偶尔露出微笑。我们的手指在被子下随意交缠，静静地躺在我们之间……这正是我所追求的生活。老实说，对我而言，还有什么比这更重要呢？

"Shinji?" she finally broke the silence with an extremely soft voice.  
"真嗣？" 她终于用极其轻柔的声音打破了沉默。

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"Remember… back at the hotel with Gendo?" I simply nod, "And remember… the last day when I was in the shower?" oh… that conversation, "We never really finished talking about it."  
"记得……在酒店和源堂在一起的时候吗？" 我简单地点了点头，"还有……我最后一天在洗澡的时候？" 哦……那次对话，"我们其实一直没有真正谈完那件事。"

"I know, but Asuka, we're fifteen, you know? I just don't think we should be doing something like that…"  
"我知道，但明日香，我们才十五岁，不是吗？我只是觉得我们不应该做那样的事……"

"Forget about that for now. Do you want to?" carefully choosing my words, I take a moment before responding.  
"现在先别想那个了。你想吗？" 我斟酌着词句，稍作停顿后才回答。

"Yeah," well there was some epic poetry…  
"嗯，" 好吧，那里有些史诗般的诗篇……

"Then I say we should. Look, I see where you're coming from, but look around you at school – even Hikari has fooled around before. And frankly, I don't care what other people think," I can't believe I was actually considering this… "We could rent a nice hotel room, have a romantic dinner… and just see where it takes us. If we don't feel ready when the time comes, we can just stop," I was silent for almost a full minute before responding.  
""那我说我们应该这么做。看，我明白你的顾虑，但看看学校里的大家——就连光也曾经胡闹过。坦白说，我不在乎别人怎么想，" 我简直不敢相信自己居然在认真考虑这个…… "我们可以租一个不错的酒店房间，享用一顿浪漫晚餐……然后看看事情会发展到哪一步。如果到时候我们觉得还没准备好，随时可以停下来，" 我沉默了近一分钟才回应。

"Sure…" I peck my blushing partner on the lips and smile, "Seems like you already made up your mind about this," she simply nods, "When do you want it to be?"  
"当然……" 我在脸红的伴侣唇上轻啄一下，微笑道，"看来你已经下定决心了，" 她只是点点头，"你想什么时候进行？

"Actually, I already looked into it… there's a hotel that I've always wanted to stay in that has an opening for tomorrow," so soon?! "I already spoke with the manager, and he said that he'll give us the room for free because of our status," her grip on my hands increases, "Let's get some sleep, we can talk later when it's more… private."  
"其实，我已经查过了……有一家我一直想住的酒店明天有空房，" 这么快？！ "我已经和经理谈过了，他说会因为我们身份特殊而免费给我们房间，" 她握紧我的手，"我们先睡吧，等更私密的时候再聊。

7:00 AM – Sunday 7:00 AM – 星期日

Somehow, I managed to get out of bed and get completely dressed without either Rei or Asuka waking up. As much as I knew that I was probably going to regret this, I was going to talk to Misato, and if all else fails, Kaji. While they can both be immature, when it's about as something as serious as this, I'm sure they'll pay attention. Closing the heavy metallic door behind me as quiet as possible, I begin to walk with a fairly steady pace to my old home. My mind was riddled with what she said last night, and what could very well happen tonight… I was still skeptical. By the time that I reached Misato's, I was almost set on doing whatever Asuka chose… why was I even here? Regardless of mentally kicking myself, I ring that incessant doorbell and wait for a reply.  
不知怎么的，我设法从床上爬起来，完全穿好衣服，而丽和明日香都没有醒来。尽管我知道自己可能会后悔，但我还是决定去找美里谈谈，如果一切都不顺利，就找加持。虽然他们俩有时都不成熟，但当事情严重到这种地步时，我相信他们会认真对待的。我尽可能安静地关上那扇沉重的金属门，开始以相当稳定的步伐走向我以前的家。我的脑海中充满了她昨晚说的话，以及今晚可能发生的事情……我仍然持怀疑态度。当我到达美里的住处时，我几乎已经决定要按照明日香的选择去做……我为什么还要来这里？尽管我内心在自责，我还是按下了那个烦人的门铃，等待回应。

"Damn it, hold on!" of course, Misato was probably still asleep. She answered the door in her typical yellow shirt and short, cut-off jeans, "Oh, Shinji! Come in!" she welcomes me into her home, and she immediately notices something adrift, "What did you do now?" I take a seat on the sofa and watch her take her place on the arm chair across from me.  
“该死，等一下！”当然，美里可能还在睡觉。她穿着她那件典型的黄色衬衫和短截牛仔裤来开门，“哦，真嗣！进来吧！”她欢迎我进入她的家，并立刻注意到有些不对劲，“你又做了什么？”我在沙发上坐下，看着她在对面的扶手椅上坐下。

"Nothing, I… just need to talk. Is that okay?"  
"没什么，我…只是需要谈谈。这样可以吗？"

"Of course!" being her usual self, she grabs a nearby empty can and begins to fiddle with it, "What about?"  
"当然可以！" 她一如既往地拿起附近的一个空罐子开始摆弄，"谈什么呢？"

"I can't believe I'm saying this… how… how old were you when…" I didn't think it was going to be this hard! "When you first…" I didn't even have to finish the sentence. She stopped fiddling with the can for a moment, never taking her eyes off of it, and once again went back to her business.  
"真不敢相信我居然要说这个…你…你几岁时…" 我没想到会这么难开口！"你第一次…" 我甚至不需要说完这句话。她停下了摆弄罐子的动作，目光始终未离开它，然后又继续忙她的。"

"Twenty or so, I was in college," she just had to throw that in, didn't she? "So, Asuka, asked you, huh?" I just nod, staring at the floor, "Well, I'm not going to lecture you on anything, because it looks like you've already made up your mind. What did you need to talk about?" I can't believe how calm she was being!  
"二十岁左右，我还在上大学，"她非得提这一句，不是吗？"所以，明日香，问了你，是吧？"我只是点点头，盯着地板，"好吧，我不会对你说教什么，因为看起来你已经下定决心了。你想谈些什么？"我简直不敢相信她能这么平静！

"Thanks… I guess I just needed some reassurance…"  
"谢谢……我想我只是需要一些安慰……"

"Well, I'm not giving it to you. I think it's a stupid idea, but you know what? It was a stupid idea when I did it too, so there," she plants on a fake smile, "Here," reaching into a basket on the table next to her, she pulls out a small square and throws it to me, "At least make one smart move."  
"好吧，我不会给你安慰的。我觉得这是个愚蠢的主意，但你知道吗？我当初也是这么想的，所以，"她挤出一个假笑，"给，"她伸手从旁边的篮子里拿出一个小方块扔给我，"至少做一件聪明事。"

"I don't even want to know why you have this in the living room… thanks…" I've never been so embarrassed in my life…  
"我甚至不想知道为什么这东西会在客厅里……谢谢……" 我这辈子从没这么尴尬过……

"My little Shinji is growing up!" in an extremely sarcastic tone, Kaji chimes in from behind me, "Who would have thought that the same timid, scared little boy I met two years ago would be doing THIS!" a pillow suddenly hits his head.  
"我的小真嗣长大了！" 用极其讽刺的语气，加持从我身后插话道，"谁能想到两年前那个胆小害怕的小男孩现在在做这种事！" 一个枕头突然砸向他的头。

"This isn't something to be joking about!"  
"这不是开玩笑的事！"

"Lighten up Misato, don't you remember how you felt at his age? Listen, you'll be fine, just don't force yourself to do it if you don't want to."  
"放松点，美里，你不记得自己那个年纪时的感觉了吗？听着，你会没事的，如果不想做就不要勉强自己。"

"Yeah, taking advice on sex from the biggest ass in Japan, there's a good idea!" Misato gets up and opens the door, signaling for me to leave, "I think you should be going now. Remember what I said."  
"是啊，从日本最大的混蛋那里获取性建议，真是个好主意！" 美里起身打开门，示意我离开，"我想你现在该走了。记住我说的话。"

"Yeah… thanks…" she pats me on the back as I left, leaving me standing outside both confused and embarrassed as all hell, "I'm so screwed…" I put Misato's 'gift' in my pocket and head back to the apartment, walking fairly slow compared to normal, "Stupid idea…"  
"是啊…谢谢…" 她在我离开时拍了拍我的背，让我站在外面既困惑又尴尬至极，"我真是完蛋了…" 我把美里的'礼物'放进口袋，慢悠悠地走回公寓，步速比平时慢了许多，"真是愚蠢的想法…"

8:00 PM – North Tokyo-3  
晚上 8:00 – 北东京-3

Asuka and I have remained silent most of the day, barely even saying good morning when I got home. Personally, I spent most of the day doing chores around the apartment, doing homework that was due the next day, listening to music… anything to keep my mind off of what may or may not happen tonight. Asuka went out with Rei to the mall earlier on, leaving me behind to gouge my eyes out with boredom. She came back in a slightly more talkative mood, but still not her normal self… I just really hope she didn't tell Rei.  
我和明日香一整天几乎都没怎么说话，我回家时连早安都只是草草带过。就我个人而言，我大部分时间都在公寓里做家务，赶着第二天要交的作业，听音乐……任何能让我不去想今晚可能会发生什么的事情。明日香早些时候和绫波一起去商场了，留下我一个人无聊到想用眼睛挖洞。她回来时稍微健谈了一些，但仍然不是平时的她……我只希望她没有告诉绫波。

As promised, we were currently in a cab on route to the hotel, which was already in sight. This wasn't exactly turning out to be the romantic evening I was hoping for… if it continues on like this, I'm just going to call it off; it just isn't worth toying with our relationship. When we reach the hotel, I pay the driver and open Asuka's door, noticing a very slight blush on her face.  
正如所承诺的，我们目前正坐在出租车上前往酒店，酒店已经近在眼前。这并不完全是我所期待的浪漫之夜……如果继续这样下去，我可能会直接取消；这根本不值得拿我们的关系来开玩笑。当我们到达酒店时，我付了司机钱并打开明日香的车门，注意到她脸上微微泛起的红晕。

"Thanks… damn it this is awkward…" we begin to walk towards the hotel as she mumbles under her breath.  
"谢谢……该死，这真尴尬……" 我们开始向酒店走去，她低声咕哝着。

"Then maybe we should just wait, you know?"  
"那也许我们应该等等，你知道吗？"

"No, it's not that at all, I just don't know what to do here," like anyone does on their first time? I grab her hand and give her a small smile.  
"不，根本不是那样，我只是不知道在这里该做什么，" 就像谁第一次就知道该怎么做似的？我抓住她的手，给了她一个浅浅的微笑。

"Well, if we go through with it, I'm sure it'll just come," horrible use of words, but I got my point across, "Now, let's see what this place has to offer!" finally, after hours, I muster a smile out of her. When we got to the front desk, it took us a good half an hour to get our room sorted out; even when the manager came down he had forgotten that he gave us the room for free. In the end however, we were able to kick off our shoes in the fairly large room. It wasn't really the grand suite, but it certainly wasn't just an average room. It feel somewhere between the two with a king sized bed laced with a skirt, a large television, a bathroom with decorations even Toji would appreciate, and above all, plenty of room.  
"好吧，如果我们真的这么做，我相信它自然会来，"用词不当，但我表达清楚了我的意思，"现在，让我们看看这个地方有什么好玩的！"终于，在几个小时后，我设法让她露出了笑容。当我们到达前台时，花了我们足足半小时才把房间安排好；即使经理下来，他也忘了他给我们免费提供房间的事。不过最终，我们还是能在相当宽敞的房间里脱下鞋子。虽然不是豪华套房，但也绝非普通房间。它介于两者之间，有一张铺着裙边的大床，一台大电视，一个连 Toji 都会欣赏其装饰的浴室，最重要的是，空间非常充足。

"You know, I never really understood why people would spend this much on a room when they're on vacation. Not like they'll be spending the entire time in here," not exactly the perfect comment from her by looking at our situation… "So, where do you want to eat?" honestly, I couldn't possibly be less hungry. My stomach was already churning at the mere thought of us sharing a bed tonight, "I was thinking sea food."  
"你知道，我从来不太明白为什么人们度假时会花这么多钱在房间上。又不是他们会整天待在这里，"考虑到我们的情况，她这话并不算完美评论……"那么，你想去哪里吃饭？"老实说，我一点儿也不饿。光是想到今晚我们要共睡一张床，我的胃就开始翻腾，"我想吃海鲜。"

"Oh God no!" she raises an eyebrow, "Uh, I-I mean, no. There's gotta be something better than that," the last thing I need is fish breath!  
"哦天哪，不！" 她挑了挑眉，"呃，我——我是说，不。总得有比那更好的选择吧，我最不想要的就是鱼腥味了！

"Geez, don't freak out, it was just a suggestion. Fine then, how about Italian? I know of a good place in here," let's see; garlic bread, tomato sauce, and God only knows what else…  
"哎呀，别激动，那只是个建议。好吧，那意大利菜怎么样？我知道这里有一家不错的店，"让我们看看；蒜蓉面包，番茄酱，还有天知道还有什么别的……

"Asuka, can you choose something less… fancy?" I might be able to save this… "Neither of us brought nice clothes, so…"  
"明日香，你能选个不那么……高档的地方吗？" 我或许还能挽救一下…… "我们俩都没穿正装，所以……"

"Okay then, how about we just go down to the buffet? I'm sure we can find something there," a sudden silence fell over the room as she took a seat on the bed, staring at the floor. After a minute or so, I broke it.  
"好吧，那我们去自助餐区怎么样？我相信那里一定能找到点什么，"她突然坐到床上，目光盯着地板，房间里陷入了一片寂静。大约一分钟后，我打破了沉默。

"Are you even hungry?" "你真的饿了吗？"

"I couldn't eat if I wanted to!" she fell back onto the bed and planted her hands on her face, "Jesus, I thought this would be easy!" yeah, using Jesus' name while talking about premarital sex… there's a one way ticket to Hell, "And before you ask, yes, I still want to do this… I'm just nervous out of my mind!" I take a seat next to her, staring up at the ceiling.  
"就算我想吃也吃不下！"她向后倒在床上，双手捂住脸，"天哪，我以为这会很容易！"是啊，在谈论婚前性行为时提到耶稣的名字……这简直是通往地狱的单程票，"在你问之前，是的，我还是想这么做……我只是紧张得要命！"我坐在她旁边，抬头望着天花板。

"Well, people don't normally set a date for this."  
"嗯，人们通常不会为此定个日子。"

"So you would rather go on spur of the moment and end up having someone walk in on us? You know that if it doesn't happen here it's going to happen at Rei's apartment or something!" she sat up and looked at me, "It's either tonight or God only knows how long from now. I know that I want it, but do you?" I took a moment to contemplate my answer.  
"所以你宁愿即兴行事，结果被人撞见？你知道如果这里不行，那就得去丽's 公寓或其他地方了！"她坐起身看着我，"要么今晚，要么天知道要等多久。我知道我想要，但你呢？"我花了一会儿时间思考我的回答。

"You saw me in the morning back at the hotel…" with a chuckle, she pushed my shoulder. Without a word, she walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind her, "Well that came out of nowhere."  
"你在酒店早上见过我……"她轻笑一声，推了推我的肩膀。她一言不发地走进浴室，关上了门，"真是突如其来。"

"Just hold on," her voice was slightly shaking, and by the time she opened the door again, less than a minute had passed, "C-Close your eyes…" expecting this to end in one of her jokes, I humor her with a sigh. I hear a few footsteps, ending with her, I'm guessing, in the middle of the room, "Okay, look."  
"坚持住，"她的声音微微颤抖，当她再次打开门时，不到一分钟过去了，"闭上眼睛……"我以为这又是她的一个玩笑，便叹了口气配合她。我听到几声脚步声，最后是她，我猜，站在房间中央，"好了，看吧。"

"You know, I-" I was immediately cut off by the sight before me, "Love you…" she was standing with her hands behind her back, stare averted from mine, and obviously blushing deeply. She somehow changed into a jet black lingerie 'dress' that only came a low as her mid-thigh. I wasn't really able to see through it, but the light from the lamp shone through it flawlessly, making an outline of every curve.  
"你知道，我——"我立刻被眼前的景象打断，"我爱你……"她站在那里，双手背在身后，目光避开我的视线，显然脸红得厉害。她不知怎么换上了一件漆黑的蕾丝内衣'裙'，只到她的大腿中部。我并不能真正透过它看清楚，但台灯的光线完美地穿透了它，勾勒出每一道曲线。

"Don't make this weirder than it already is… I got it at the mall today…" completely forgetting the fact that Rei was with her, I stand up with shaking knees and walk towards her, "I… thought it would help the mood…" I stop in front of her and simply stare at the face of Venus herself. Finally, her eyes meet with mine and she smiles awkwardly, "Well…? Are you just going to stand there…?" unsure of exactly what to do, I move in for a kiss, and she does anything but deny me. As usual, I place my hands on her hips as we embrace each other, slowly walking backwards to the bed. Just before reaching it, she pulled back and smiled, "Catch," she jumps up, wrapping her legs around my torso and continues to smile in a way I've never seen a woman smile before. I support her in a way that would normally end with a beating, but instead, she just replies with a soft "It's okay."  
"别让这比原本更奇怪了……我今天在商场买的……" 完全忘记了丽也在场，我颤抖着双腿站起来走向她，"我……以为这会改善气氛……" 我站在她面前，只是凝视着维纳斯般的面容。终于，她的目光与我对上，尴尬地笑了笑，"那么……？你就打算这么站着……？" 不确定该做什么，我靠近想要亲吻，而她丝毫没有拒绝的意思。一如既往，我将手放在她的腰间，我们相拥着慢慢向后退向床边。就在快要碰到床时，她退后一步笑了笑，"接住，" 她跳起来，双腿环绕在我身上，继续以一种我从未见过的笑容微笑着。我以一种通常会招致一顿揍的方式支撑着她，但她只是温柔地回应，"没关系。"

I lie her on the bed, continuing our former embrace… not much was said from that point on outside of the occasional muffled speaking. Within ten minutes of her jumping onto me, the floor was completely littered with cloth, and we were under the covers with a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door.  
我将她放在床上，继续之前的拥抱……从那以后，除了偶尔的含糊话语，几乎没有说什么。在她跳到我身上十分钟后，地板上已经满是衣物，我们盖着被子，门上挂着'请勿打扰'的牌子。

Thirty Minutes Later 三十分钟后

When the act was over, she literally went completely limp and fell down on top of me, barely able to catch her breath. Of course, as expected, she took control of the situation… as if it mattered to me. All I was able to hear was her panting with her head right next to mine as my hands rested on her bare back – it was pure heaven. Halfway through the act, I realized that we forgot to use what Misato gave me, but when I brought it up she just shrugged it off… quite literally. While I know that it was an extremely immature thing to do, I honestly couldn't care less right now.  
当这一幕结束时，她几乎完全瘫软，倒在我身上，几乎喘不过气来。当然，如预期般，她掌控了局面……仿佛这对我有何影响。我能听到的只有她在我耳边急促的呼吸声，我的手放在她赤裸的背上——这简直是天堂。中途我意识到我们忘了用美里给我的东西，但当我提起时，她只是耸耸肩……字面意义上的。虽然我知道这是极其幼稚的行为，但老实说，我现在真的不在乎。

"Does it… still hurt?" I whispered into her ear, remembering how it started off with her crying. Apparently unable to speak, she just shakes her head and rolls off of me, taking her place next to me. Her eyes were barely open, but just enough to see her crystal blue eyes staring back at me with a smile.  
“它……还疼吗？”我轻声在她耳边问道，想起一开始她哭泣的样子。显然无法说话，她只是摇摇头，从我身上滚开，躺在我旁边。她的眼睛几乎闭着，但足以看到她那晶莹的蓝眼睛带着微笑回望着我。

"I told you… this was a good idea…" I couldn't help but laugh slightly. With a deep sigh to catch her breath, Asuka closes her eyes, the smile still planted on her face. Following her action, I fall asleep soon after, holding her close to me the entire time.  
“我告诉过你……这是个好主意……”我不禁轻笑出声。深吸一口气缓过气来，明日香闭上眼睛，笑容依旧挂在脸上。跟着她的动作，我很快入睡，整夜紧紧抱着她。

10:00 AM 上午 10:00

"Shinjiiiiiiii…" I wake up to a fully conscious Asuka singing my name with a smile on, "Time to wake up," we were still in the exact same position as last night, giving me quite a view, "You know, we still have this room for another hour before we have to check out…"  
"新二 iiiiiiii…" 我醒来时，明日香已经完全清醒，微笑着唱着我的名字，"该起床了，" 我们仍然保持着昨晚的姿势，让我大饱眼福，"你知道吗，我们这个房间还可以再待一个小时才需要退房…"

"I think I see where you're going with this…" with a smile, we once again embrace in a tight kiss… that is, before there was a soft knocking on the door.  
"我想我知道你接下来想干什么…" 我微笑着，我们再次紧紧拥吻…就在这时，门外传来了轻轻的敲门声。

"Just ignore it," her voice was muffled through our contact as we continued the kiss. Of course, the door sent it's piercing sound through the air once more, "Ugh!" she uses her palm to push on my chest, abruptly ending the kiss, "What?! Can't you read?!" okay, ouch?  
"别理它，" 她的声音透过我们的接触变得模糊，我们继续着亲吻。当然，门再次发出刺耳的声音穿透空气，"呃！" 她用手掌推着我的胸膛，突然结束了亲吻，"什么？！你不会读吗？！" 好吧，真伤人。

"Asuka, it's Misato, get dressed and meet me outside. There's a problem at NERV. Shinji, you too," how the hell did she find us? Well, it is NERV after all.  
"明日香，是美里，穿好衣服出来见我。NERV 有麻烦了。真嗣，你也一样，" 她到底是怎么找到我们的？不过，毕竟是 NERV 嘛。

"Can't this wait? We're just a little busy here!" well, she doesn't seem to care about hiding this at all.  
"这事不能等等吗？我们这儿正忙着呢！" 好吧，她似乎根本不在乎掩饰这一点。

"No, it can't. Now hurry up," we hear her footsteps leading away from the door.  
"不，不可能。快点，"我们听到她的脚步声逐渐远离门口。

"Damn it!" she rips the covers off and storms around the room, picking up her miscellaneous clothing, "I swear, we ask for ONE night off, just one! But nooooo! God forbid WE actually have a life outside of that damned building!" with a sigh, I begin to pick up my things as well, "Seriously Shinji, aren't you pissed?!" no, not at all. I was just about to have a repeat of last night, and I'm not pissed at all.  
"该死！"她猛地掀开被子，在房间里怒气冲冲地走来走去，捡起她零散的衣服，"我发誓，我们只要求一个晚上的休息，就一个！但偏偏不！上帝啊，我们难道就不能在那该死的建筑外有个生活吗！"我叹了口气，也开始收拾我的东西，"说真的，真嗣，你不生气吗？！"不，一点也不。我正准备重温昨晚的美好，我一点儿也不生气。

"Of course I am, but we can't do anything about it. Let's just go," for the first time, we get dressed in front of each other – though it was still awkward – and hurry out of the room. We finally reach the front of the building where Misato was waiting in her newly painted blue sports car.  
"我当然生气，但我们对此无能为力。我们走吧，"这是我们第一次在彼此面前穿衣服——尽管仍然很尴尬——然后匆匆离开了房间。我们终于到达了建筑的前面，美里正坐在她新涂成蓝色的跑车上等着我们。

"This better be fucking good!" Asuka slams the door as she climbs in. Who knew that she would get this mad?  
"这最好他妈的有用！" 明日香一上车就猛地关上门。谁知道她会这么生气？

"Wow, a little touchy, are we? Look, it'll only take a few hours, then you can go back to whatever you were doing…" Misato winks at me through the rear view mirror.  
"哇，有点敏感啊，是吧？听着，只需要几个小时，然后你就可以继续做你的事了……" 美里透过后视镜向我眨眼。

"I saw that… what was that supposed to mean?" greeeeaaat….  
"我看到了……那是什么意思？" 天啊……

"Well let's see; a couple spending the night in a fancy hotel, wrinkled clothes, and you're literally glowing. I would venture to guess that you were either doing LSD or… well, each other," she couldn't help but smile a little. My eyes were fixed on the headrest in front of me, not wanting to make eye contact with anyone… but, of course, it eventually came down to me looking at the woman sitting next to me. When this happened, however, I think I died a little inside; she was looking directly at me, her head slightly tilted and her eyes twisted into a form of anger I've never seen before.  
"好吧，让我们看看；一对情侣在豪华酒店过夜，衣服皱巴巴的，而你简直在发光。我敢打赌，你们要么是在吸 LSD，要么……嗯，彼此之间，"她忍不住微微一笑。我的眼睛紧盯着前排的头枕，不想与任何人进行眼神交流……但当然，最终还是轮到我看向坐在我旁边的女人。然而，当这一刻发生时，我觉得自己内心有些死去；她正直视着我，头微微倾斜，眼睛扭曲成一种我从未见过的愤怒。

"You told HER?" I back up as far as I could go, "You told MISATO?" a few more seconds of silence pass, "Why not just tell everyone, huh?! Misato couldn't keep a secret to save her life!"  
"你告诉她了？"我尽可能地往后退，"你告诉美里了？"又是几秒钟的沉默，"为什么不干脆告诉所有人呢？！美里连个秘密都守不住！"

"It's true," not helping!  
"这是真的，"毫无帮助！

"Is that why you weren't at home yesterday morning? You were telling her?! Shinji, that's our business, not hers!"  
"这就是你昨天早上不在家的原因吗？你在告诉她？！真嗣，这是我们的事，不是她的！"

"Actually, it is my business. If you get pregnant, I'll be the one to be torn apart by Gendo, which is why I gave Shinji a condom. Also, you two are legally brother and sister, so yeah… good luck next time!" … good lord she's right…  
"实际上，这是我的事。如果你怀孕了，我将是被源堂撕碎的那个人，这就是为什么我给了真嗣一个避孕套。而且，你们俩在法律上是兄妹，所以……祝你们下次好运！"" ……天哪，她说得对……"

"You…" Asuka takes a deep breath before continuing, "I'll deal with you later," she points at me, her eyes now closed, "Misato, I swear, if you tell anyone I'll kill you."  
"你……" 明日香深吸一口气，继续说道，"我晚点再跟你算账，"她指着我，眼睛现在闭上了，"美里，我发誓，如果你告诉任何人，我会杀了你。"

"I know, I know." "我知道，我知道。"

"No, I don't think you do. I will seriously murder you with my bare hands, are we clear?" I wouldn't put it past her either…  
"不，我觉得你不懂。我真会用这双手把你给宰了，明白吗？"" 我也不怀疑她会这么做……

"Okay Asuka, I got it, but you're really not helping your own situation. Like I said before, it's obvious you two slept together. I mean Jesus, you're not even wearing a bra!" embarrassed, Asuka crosses her arms.  
"好吧，明日香，我明白了，但你真的没帮自己什么忙。就像我之前说的，很明显你们俩睡过了。我是说天哪，你甚至都没穿胸罩！"" 明日香尴尬地交叉双臂。

"Well neither are you, so there!"  
"你也不是，所以呢！"

A/N – Yeah, well, the vacation idea was stupid as hell, so I pretty much got rid of it and replaced it with… well, this. Don't really know where this is headed; hell, I don't even know why they're going to NERV yet, but we'll all find out in the next chapter, Mockery; until then, keep on keepin' on!  
作者笔记 – 没错，那个度假的想法蠢透了，所以我基本上把它抛弃了，换成了……嗯，这个。真不知道这会走向何方；见鬼，我甚至还不清楚他们为什么要去 NERV，但我们在下一章《嘲弄》中都会找到答案；在此之前，继续加油吧！

### Chapter 18: Mockery

A/N – If you've seen End of Evangelion, completely disregard everything that happened in there for this chapter to make any sense what so ever.  
作者注 – 如果你看过《新世纪福音战士剧场版：Air/真心为你》，请完全忽略那里面发生的一切，以便这部作品chapter能说得通。

NERV Halls – 10:45 AM  
NERV 总部 – 上午 10:45

The whole thing about Asuka being mad at me for telling Misato has made a serious turn for the worse. It went from being slightly funny to just plain worrisome; she hasn't said a single word to me since we stopped talking in the car, and every time I try to say something she acts as if I wasn't even there. And you know what the worst part about all this is? The only thing that I walked away with Misato with, we didn't even use!  
关于明日香因为我告诉美里而生气的事情，已经严重恶化了。从有点好笑变成了纯粹的令人担忧；自从我们在车上停止交谈后，她一句话也没跟我说过，每次我试图说话，她都表现得好像我根本不在那里。你知道这一切最糟糕的部分是什么吗？我和美里一起离开时唯一带走的东西，我们甚至都没用上！

"What are we here for?" even her voice hurts…  
"我们来这儿是为了什么？" 连她的声音都带着痛……

"Well, different NERV stations around the world have been working on a project while we were fighting the Angels. Unfortunately, they're a little late, but that doesn't matter, it's good to have. They're basically a new form of your Evas, just better," like it matters; we're done.  
"嗯，世界各地的 NERV 分站在我们与使徒作战时一直在进行一个项目。不幸的是，他们有点晚了，但这不重要，有总比没有好。它们基本上是你们 Eva 的新形式，只是更先进，" 好像这有什么关系；我们已经完蛋了。

"So you're telling me that billions of tax dollars went into building something that we can't possibly use?" at least she's starting up her sarcasm again, "What countries are we talking about here?"  
"所以你是说，数十亿的税款被用来建造了一个我们根本无法使用的东西？" 至少她又开始讽刺了，"我们说的是哪些国家？"  
"Well, there's the United States and Canada – they were working together-"  
"嗯，有美国和加拿大——他们当时是合作关系——"

"Of course it was the North Americans! Jesus, can't they ever do something right?" well, if I recall right, Japan is still basically the US's bitch…  
"当然是北美洲人！天哪，他们就不能做对一件事吗？" 好吧，如果我没记错，日本基本上还是美国的跟班……

"But, as I was saying, the leader in the research was the NERV headquarters in Germany. In fact Asuka, you may have already seen a few prototypes of this when you were a little girl," and here comes the explanation as to why Germany was right…  
"但是，正如我所说，研究的主要领导者是德国的 NERV 总部。实际上，明日香，你可能在你小时候就已经见过这项技术的几个原型了，" 接下来就是解释为什么德国是正确的……

"Oh… maybe…" she didn't defend them?! She always defends them! Hell, I've heard her debate why the Holocaust was necessary! "What's so special about these things?"  
"哦…或许…" 她没有为他们辩护？！她总是为他们辩护的！见鬼，我听过她辩论为什么大屠杀是必要的！"这些事情有什么特别的？"

"Well, for one, no more of that cable business, that's the first thing they got rid of. Outside of that, I know that there's quite a few alterations, but I really don't know it. We'll see when we get there," once again, a deafening silence struck the halls as we walked; only the annoying sound of metal foots steps could be heard, "You know, for a girl who just got some, you're not really in the best mood. I remember how I was… I was at the top of the world for weeks!"  
"嗯，首先，不再有那些电缆问题了，这是他们首先解决的事情。除此之外，我知道有很多改动，但我真的不太清楚。我们到了那里就会知道，" 我们走过时，又一次，大厅里响起了震耳欲聋的沉默；只能听到那烦人的金属脚步声，"你知道吗，对于一个刚得到满足的女孩来说，你的心情并不太好。我记得我当时…我高兴得像在云端一样，持续了好几周！"

"Well, I WAS in a good mood before you came around," she didn't blame it on me! WOOO!  
"好吧，在你来之前我心情还不错，" 她没有怪罪到我头上！太棒了！

"Hey, Shinji did the right thing by coming to me," NO! "If he didn't, I'm willing to bet any amount of money that you two wouldn't have been safe about it!" well… "Asuka, I already said that I won't tell anyone, I know how you're feeling."  
"嘿，真嗣来找我是正确的选择，" 不！ "如果他没来，我敢打赌你们俩绝不会安全无虞！" 嗯… "明日香，我已经说过我不会告诉任何人，我知道你的感受。"

"We didn't even use it…" she mumbled under her breath, barely audible.  
"我们甚至都没用过它…" 她低声咕哝，几乎听不见。

"What was that?" oh thank God, she wasn't being sarcastic, Misato really didn't hear that…  
"你说什么？" 哦感谢上帝，她不是在讽刺，美里真的没听到那句话…

"Nothing. Look, can we just drop it? I don't want to talk about this with YOU," personally, I don't think that there would be a better person to talk about it with. I mean really, she's been like a mother to both of us. A few more minutes of silence finally brought us to the holding cage where the new style of Evas were being held.  
"没什么。听着，我们能别提这事了吗？我不想和你讨论这个。" 就我个人而言，我不认为有谁比她更适合谈这件事了。我是说真的，她对我们俩来说就像母亲一样。又沉默了几分钟，我们终于来到了关押新型 Eva 的拘禁笼。

As usual, the giant doors slowly opened to release that foul stench of LCL, only the view of our Evas weren't in sight. The first thing I saw was Rei, in her plugsuit, speaking with my father, and of course, the second thing that caught my eye were two giant masses of white. I think I let out something along the lines of 'holy crap', but I'm not exactly sure. The body was pretty much exactly like the normal Evas, just absolutely snow white. Their heads looked more like huge Q-tips with smiling, lipstick painted expressions on their face. Both slightly bore some teeth, but that was about it – no eyes, no ears, nothing. Hell if I know how we're going to see… as promised, there was no such cable found on the back, though I couldn't really see to clearly.  
像往常一样，巨大的门缓缓打开，释放出 LCL 那股难闻的气味，只是我们的 Eva 并未出现在视野中。我首先看到的是绫波，她穿着插入栓服，正与我的父亲交谈，当然，第二件吸引我眼球的是两团巨大的白色物体。我想我大概是说了句'我的天'之类的话，但不太确定。它们的身体几乎和普通的 Eva 一模一样，只是完全雪白。它们的头部看起来更像巨大的棉签，脸上涂着口红，带着微笑的表情。两者都略微露出了牙齿，但仅此而已——没有眼睛，没有耳朵，什么都没有。天知道我们怎么才能看见……正如所承诺的，背上并没有发现电缆，尽管我看得不是很清楚。

"Oh, so you're finally here," Gendo raises an eyebrow at the sight of Asuka before continuing, "I can see why you're late. These are the Eva series; a mass production of more efficient weapons than you have used in the past. They are able to regenerate from even the most fatal attacks, given time of course, they carry a mutation that allows them to travel without any power supply outside of their own, and above all, they're about the most useless thing NERV has thrown at the world in years."  
"哦，你终于来了，" 看到明日香出现，源堂挑了挑眉毛，继续说道，"我能理解你为何迟到。这些是 Eva 系列；比你们过去使用的更高效的武器量产型。它们能在最致命的攻击下自我再生，当然需要时间，它们携带一种突变，允许它们在没有外部电源的情况下自行移动，而且最重要的是，它们是 NERV 多年来向世界抛出的最无用的东西。"

"I like them," Rei, still staring at the Eva in front of her, murmured as she always does.  
"我喜欢它们，" 绫波依旧盯着面前的 Eva，像往常一样低声说道。

"As you should; they are improvements on your Eva. Units 01 and 02 turned out to be too… emotional, I should say."  
"正如你所应感受的；它们是对你的 Eva 的改进。01 和 02 号机显得过于…情绪化，我该这么说。"

"Emotional?" Asuka, about to defend her Eva, chimed in.  
"情绪化？" 明日香正准备为自己的 Eva 辩护，插话道。

"Yes; Unit 02's clone ended up completely destroying the NERV base in North America, and Unit 01's clone simply wouldn't take in a power supply and died… sounds about right for you two, hm?" he just had to throw in that last part, didn't he?  
"是的；02 号机的克隆体彻底摧毁了北美 NERV 基地，而 01 号机的克隆体就是不肯接受能源供应，最后死了……听起来挺符合你们俩的风格，对吧？" 他非得加上最后那部分，不是吗？

"So wait, if all the other NERV bases have been working on this, what have you been doing?" Gendo rubs the base of his nose at my question and points towards the control tower, where Maya could clearly be seen with a beer bong in her mouth, downing an entire six-pack with a good ten people around her.  
"等等，如果所有其他 NERV 基地都在研究这个，那你们在做什么？" 面对我的问题，碇源堂揉了揉鼻梁，指向控制塔，只见摩耶嘴里叼着啤酒龙头，周围围着十来个人，她正一口气喝完一整箱啤酒。

"Pathetic if you ask me," Misato plants on a small smirk as she spoke.  
"要我说，真是可悲，" 美里说着，嘴角勾起一抹浅笑。

"But yes, moving on, we will need you to test these out. Yes, I realize it is pointless, but please just don't put up a fight, I still have a headache…" walking through the opposite doors, he left us standing there unsure of exactly what to do.  
"不过，是的，继续说，我们需要你测试这些。我知道这毫无意义，但请别反抗，我头还疼着呢……" 他穿过对面的门离开，留下我们站在那里，不知所措。

"I guess we get dressed in our plug suits…"  
"我想我们得穿上插入栓服……"

"There's an idea! We're about to pilot, so we should get dressed in the plug suits!" Asuka smacks me on the back of the head as she walks away towards the locker room.  
"有主意了！我们马上要驾驶，所以应该穿上插入栓服！" 明日香一边说着，一边拍了拍我的后脑勺，然后朝更衣室走去。

"Jesus Shinji, were you really that bad?" Misato simply laughs as she follows Asuka. I was left there, awkwardly eye-locked with Rei for a few seconds before she spoke in her half monotone, half normal voice.  
"天哪，真嗣，你真的那么糟糕吗？" 美里只是笑着跟在明日香后面。我留在那里，尴尬地与绫波对视了几秒钟，然后她用半是单调半是正常的声音开口了。

"You realize the entire school knows by now, yes?" I hang my head and nod as I walk past her, towards the locker rooms.  
"你意识到全校现在都知道了吧，对吗？" 我垂下头，点了点头，从她身边走过，朝更衣室走去。

"Yeah…" "嗯…"

Men's Locker Room 男更衣室

Ignoring the strong smell of beer, I got dressed as quickly as I could. I have to admit, having the plug suit on again was odd; I've grown accustomed to not wearing it, so the skin-tightness of it was killing me. Almost at the exact moment of me grabbing the door handle, it swung open to reveal Asuka, also in her plug suit, red with anger.  
无视浓烈的啤酒味，我尽可能快地穿好衣服。我得承认，再次穿上插入栓服感觉很奇怪；我已经习惯了不穿它，所以那种紧贴感让我难以忍受。就在我抓住门把手的那一刻，门猛地打开了，露出了同样穿着插入栓服的明日香，她满脸怒气，脸色通红。

"Asuka, will you-" before I could finish, I was met with a hard slap to the face. My eyes were wide as my head was thrown to the side, my face now throbbing.  
“明日香，你能——”我还没说完，脸上就挨了一记重重的耳光。我的眼睛瞪得大大的，头被甩向一边，脸颊现在火辣辣地疼。

"What is wrong with you?" her voice was slightly shaking as she spoke in a soft voice, "Why would you do that to me?"  
"你怎么了？" 她的声音微微颤抖，轻声说道，"你为什么要那样对我？"

"Asuka, I just wanted to talk to someone about it that actually knows what she's talking about."  
"明日香，我只是想找个人谈谈，一个真正知道自己在说什么的人。"

"I don't care what she told you! This was supposed to be something special between US, not her! I asked you not to tell anyone, and the first thing you do is sneak behind my back and tell the biggest gossip in the city!" tears began to form in her eyes as she spoke, "Do you know what's going to happen if word gets out in school? We've only been dating for a few weeks Shinji! I'll be labeled a whore!" I simply keep quiet, not wanting to worsen the situation any further, "So that's it, huh?" she uses the back of her hand to wipe away the tears, "You're…" she cut herself off, whipping around and walking away from me. I still don't see what I did as that big of a deal, and she said herself that all of the people in our class have done the same thing.  
"我不在乎她跟你说了什么！这本应是我们之间的特别之事，不是她的！我让你不要告诉任何人，而你做的第一件事就是背着我，告诉城里最大的八卦者！" 她的眼眶开始泛泪，"你知道如果这消息在学校传开会发生什么吗？我们才交往了几周，真嗣！我会被贴上荡妇的标签！" 我保持沉默，不想让情况变得更糟，"所以就这样了，是吗？" 她用手背擦去泪水，"你……" 她突然打住，转身离开了我。我仍然不认为我做了什么大不了的事，她自己也说过我们班上的人都做过同样的事。

"She's just over reacting, give it some time," Kaji walked in from the opposite cornet from where Asuka stormed off, "See, when women have sex for the first time, their hormones go crazy; it's meant to prepare them for pregnancy… kind of an evolutionary left over. By this time tomorrow, she'll be fine, trust me," still slightly beating myself up, I walk past him without a word for once. I trailed behind a racing Asuka the entire way, trying to image what was going on in her head, and by the time we once again reached the cage, I came to the conclusion that I really was an asshole.  
"她只是反应过度了，给她点时间，" 加持从阿斯卡冲出去的对面角落走进来，"你看，女人第一次发生性行为时，她们的荷尔蒙会疯狂波动；这是为了准备怀孕……可以说是进化遗留的产物。到明天这个时候，她就会没事的，相信我，" 我仍然在自我责备，这次却一言不发地从他身边走过。我一路跟在疾跑的阿斯卡后面，试图想象她脑子里在想什么，等我们再次到达那个笼子时，我得出了结论：我真是个混蛋。

"Ah, here you are," Ritsuko approached the three of us with a smile, "Long time no see, huh? Look, this is going to be easy, it won't take long," almost exactly as she finished the sentence, all three of the white Evas jetted out an entry plug from their chest, leveling out with the bridge, "Yeah, that's one of the many improved features of these Evas; much easier entry! Okay, just go ahead and choose one, it doesn't matter. This won't take more than an hour," without a word, Asuka and Rei climb into the first two Evas, forcing me to walk a little while towards mine.  
"啊，你在这里，" 律子带着微笑向我们三人走来，"好久不见了，是吧？看，这很简单，不会花太长时间，" 她几乎刚说完这句话，三台白色 EVA 就从胸口射出了插入栓，与桥面齐平，"是的，这是这些 EVA 众多改进功能之一；更容易进入！好了，随便选一台吧，没关系。这不会超过一个小时，" 阿斯卡和绫波一言不发地爬进了前两台 EVA，迫使我向我的那台走去。

It was almost exactly like normal… well, the entry plug at least. It had all the same controls, same screen, and even the same feeling of LCL. The screen flickered to life, showing the bridge in full detail. Unlike the Eva, however, I was able to look behind me and see just as if it were my eyes. The faces of Asuka and Rei were on the communication link to the bottom right, allowing me to see how Asuka was doing. Oddly enough, she looked normal like this… not that she already got over what happened, but she just looked natural in her plug suit.  
一切几乎与平常无异…至少驾驶舱是这样的。所有的控制装置、屏幕，甚至连 LCL 的感觉都一模一样。屏幕闪烁着亮起，详细地呈现出舰桥的全貌。然而，与 Eva 不同的是，我能够回头看到身后的景象，仿佛就是用我的眼睛在看。在右下角的通讯链接中，可以看到明日香和绫波的脸，让我能观察明日香的状态。奇怪的是，她看起来很正常…并不是说她已经从发生的事情中恢复过来，而是她穿着驾驶服的样子显得很自然。

"Can you three hear me?" Ritsuko popped up on the main screen with a smile on her face.  
“你们三个能听到我说话吗？”律子出现在主屏幕上，面带微笑。

"Yes," we all say in unison.  
“能听到，”我们齐声回答。

"Good. Listen, this is just another sync test, so don't get nervous. Relax and do what you do best!" her face disappears, and with a sigh, I once again begin the boring ritual that are sync tests.  
“好。听着，这只是又一次同步测试，别紧张。放松，做你最擅长的事！”她的脸消失了，我叹了口气，再次开始了那无聊的同步测试仪式。

One Hour Later 一小时后

"Okay kids, sorry for the delay, we're all done here. I'm ejecting you now," I was pushed back into the seat as the entry plug shot out of the chest of whatever this thing was. By the time I was out, Asuka was already walking towards the locker room. While I was in there for over an hour with nothing else to do, I made up my mind to at least try and talk this out. I catch up to her just as she was entering the locker room, and I place my hand on her shoulder to stop her movements.  
“好了，孩子们，抱歉耽搁了，我们这里都完成了。我现在要把你们弹射出去。”随着插入栓从这东西的胸口射出，我被推回到座位上。当我出来时，明日香已经走向更衣室了。我在里面待了一个多小时，无所事事，于是下定决心至少要尝试解决这个问题。就在她进入更衣室的那一刻，我追上了她，把手放在她的肩膀上，阻止了她的动作。

"What is it?" her voice was bitter, blank, and just plain harsh.  
"怎么了？"她的声音苦涩、空洞，甚至有些刺耳。

"I'm sorry, you're right, I shouldn't have said anything. That was supposed to be something we shared, and I ruined it… but please don't act like this. It's killing me," she turned around with a smile on her face, "Okay, what the hell, seriously?"  
"对不起，你说得对，我不该说那些。那本是我们共享的，却被我毁了……但请别这样，这让我心如刀割，"她转过身来，脸上挂着微笑，"好吧，到底怎么回事，说真的？"

"Misato was talking to me the entire time through a private link. Don't worry about it, I was just embarrassed," she pecked me on the lips before entering the locker room, leaving me confused as hell.  
"美里一直在通过私人链接跟我说话。别担心，我只是有点尴尬，"她在进入更衣室前在我唇上轻啄了一下，留下我一头雾水。

"Women, huh?" I turn around to see Kaji standing in front of the men's locker room with a black eye.  
"女人，嗯？" 我转过身，看到加持站在男更衣室前，眼眶乌青。

"One second they're about to tear out your throat and the next they're all over you… or, you know, the other way around…" apparently Asuka wasn't talking with Misato the ENTIRE time. Laughing to myself, I walk into the locker room. The rest of the day, oddly enough, was spent at NERV just talking with old friends. The Evas were the furthest things from our minds, we were just relaxing. Thankfully, no one else brought up what happened last night, but whether or not they actually knew was an entirely different story. By the time we left, it was just hitting nine at night; Misato offered to drive us home, but the three of us just decided to walk back. It was only about a mile away, and seeing as we had to go to school the next morning, we all opted to get some fresh air.  
"前一秒她们还打算撕裂你的喉咙，下一秒就黏上你了……或者，你知道的，反过来也一样……" 显然，明日香并没有全程和美里交谈。我暗自发笑，走进更衣室。奇怪的是，那天剩下的时间我们都在 NERV 里和老朋友聊天。EVA 完全不在我们的脑海中，我们只是在放松。幸运的是，没有人再提起昨晚发生的事，但他们是否真的知道则是另一回事。当我们离开时，已经是晚上九点；美里提出开车送我们回家，但我们三个决定步行回去。那地方离这里只有一英里左右，而且考虑到第二天还要上学，我们都选择呼吸一下新鲜空气。

"So, Rei," Asuka chimed in almost immediately after leaving NERV, "I take it you know too, huh?"  
"那么，绫波，" 我们刚离开 NERV，明日香就立刻插话道，"我想你也知道了吧，嗯？"

"Quite." "当然。"

"Mind keeping that quiet? I don't want word to spread around school," well isn't she being calm about this?  
""能保密吗？我不想这事在学校传开，”她对此倒是镇定自若。”

"Naturally. Just keep your hands to yourselves when I'm around. We do share the same room, keep that in mind," like we would do that in front of her!  
""自然。我在这儿时，你们就自重些。我们毕竟同住一室，别忘了这点，”谁会在她面前那样做啊！”

"Can we PLEASE drop this?!" finally, I spoke up and attempted to end it.  
"我们能不能别再提这个了？！" 我终于开口，试图结束这个话题。

"Awww, is my little Shinji embarrassed?" Asuka pinches my cheek in sarcasm, "How cute!"  
"哎呀，我的小真嗣害羞了吗？" 明日香用讽刺的口吻捏了捏我的脸颊，"真可爱！"

6:00 AM – Streets 早上 6 点 – 街道

"Asuka, do we have to go through this every day? Why don't you just get up earlier?" Asuka was on my back as I carried her to school. She's normally at least capable of walk on her own, but this morning she was, and I quote, 'dead tired'.  
“明日香，我们每天都得这样吗？你为什么不早点起床？”我背着明日香去学校。她通常至少能自己走，但今天早上她说她‘累得要死’。

"Because…" well there's a reason!  
“因为…”嗯，有原因的！

"I feel rather good today, actually," Rei was still eating a bagel she made before leaving, and there was a certain pep in her walk that seemed to just get under Asuka's skin for some reason.  
“其实我今天感觉挺好的，”绫波还在吃她出门前做的百吉饼，她走路时那种轻快的步伐不知为何让明日香感到不爽。

"You're just a morning person… freak…" Asuka buried her face into my neck and yawned as she spoke.  
"你只是个早起的怪人……" 明日香把脸埋进我的脖颈，边说边打了个哈欠。

"And apparently you're a night person," on the inside, I was laughing so hard my eyes were watering… yeah, on the outside I just kept quiet… I think Asuka was too tired to pick up on her comeback, so we just dropped it, "How… disappointing. Soryu, are you even awake?"  
"而显然你是个夜猫子，" 内心深处，我笑得眼泪都快出来了……是啊，表面上我只是保持沉默……我想明日香太累了，没察觉到她的回击，所以我们只是就此打住，"真……令人失望。惣流，你真的醒着吗？"

"Yeah, Asuka, you have to wake up, we're almost there," she just responded with a childish moan that just screams 'five more minutes', "Okay, come on," I set her down and she takes her own weight on her legs, "We really have to find a way to get you up in the morning."  
"是的，明日香，你得醒醒，我们快到了，" 她只是发出一声孩子气的呻吟，仿佛在喊'再睡五分钟'，"好了，来吧，" 我把她放下，她自己站稳了双腿，"我们真的得想办法让你早上起床。"

"It's not that," she spoke through a yawn while rubbing her eyes, "I just didn't sleep much last night. I couldn't get to sleep, I don't know why," well at least she's talking now, "Well, at least it's only five more days until the break… God, I can't wait… we still haven't found anything to do yet though."  
"不是那个，" 她一边打哈欠一边揉眼睛说道，"我只是昨晚没怎么睡。我睡不着，不知道为什么，" 至少她现在开始说话了，"嗯，至少再过五天就放假了…天啊，我等不及了…不过我们还没找到要做什么呢。"

"I have a proposition," we all turn around to see Gendo and Fuyutsuki standing behind us in button up, short sleeve shirts and shorts.  
"我有个提议，" 我们转身看到源堂和冬月站在我们身后，穿着短袖衬衫和短裤。"

"Oh God no… no, no, no!" Asuka turns back around and continues to walk.  
"哦，天哪，不…不，不，不！" 明日香转过身继续走。"

"Soryu, we-" "惣流，我们——"

"No! Nada! Nein!" she held her hand in the air as she walked with a steady pace. Where did they even come from? "Last time I listened to you two I ended up with a dislocated finger, bruising galore, and a few events I'd rather not recall! NO!"  
"不行！绝对不行！没门！" 她一边稳步前行，一边在空中挥舞着手。他们到底是从哪儿冒出来的？"上次听你们俩的，我手指脱臼，浑身淤青，还有些事我宁愿不记得！绝对不行！"

"You could win a car," she stopped walking. God she's easily persuaded with money and gifts! She only stopped for a few seconds before once again continuing on.  
"你可以赢辆车，" 她停下了脚步。天啊，她对金钱和礼物真是毫无抵抗力！她只停了几秒钟，就又继续前行了。

"No drivers license, doesn't matter."  
"没有驾照，没关系。"

"Ahem…" Gendo held up two cards, one with Asuka's picture and one with mine, "You'd be surprised at how easily these things are bought," she whips around to see his bribe and bits her lip, "Well?" she made her way back to him and gave him the look from hell.  
"咳咳……" 源渡举起两张卡片，一张是明日香的，一张是我的，"你会惊讶于这些东西有多容易买到，"她转身看到他的贿赂，咬了咬嘴唇，"那么？"她走回他身边，给了他一个地狱般的眼神。

"I hate you…" she snatched the card and slid it in her pocket, "But, deal. You in Shinji?"  
"我恨你……" 她抢过卡片，塞进口袋，"但是，成交。你呢，真嗣？"

"We don't even know what he's going to ask us to do!" for all we know its ten times worse than before!  
"我们甚至不知道他要我们做什么！" 说不定比之前糟糕十倍呢！"

"It's Takeshi's Castle again, actually. We were chosen to enter in the semi-final rounds," semi? SEMI?! That means there's another one after this!  
"其实是《关卡大挑战》啦，实际上。我们被选中参加半决赛，" 半决赛？半决？！那意味着还有一场比赛在后面！"

"Ugh, whatever…" I grab the card being held in front of me as the two adults smile, "I better get something too."  
"呃，随便吧…" 我接过面前那张卡片，两个大人微笑着，"我也该得到点什么。"

"We will be leaving as of Friday night, so be ready. Ayanami, sorry for excluding you, but Soryu and Ikari are both much more athletic," she simply shrugs and turns around, beginning to finish the walk to school.  
"我们将于周五晚上出发，准备好。绫波，抱歉把你排除在外，但惣流和碇都更加擅长运动，" 她只是耸了耸肩，转身开始走向学校。

"I would decline anyway. I saw what happened last time," at least she's smart enough to walk away from this unscathed… "That and I don't promote illegal purchasing of a legal document," Gendo simply laughs as the two walk off. I found myself standing alone in the middle of the street, watching even Asuka leave me alone.  
"我无论如何都会拒绝的。我见过上次发生的事，" 至少她足够聪明，能毫发无损地远离这麻烦… "而且我不支持非法购买合法文件，" 碇只是笑了笑，两人走开了。我发现自己独自站在街道中央，看着连明日香也离我而去。

"God damn it…" I walk with my head hanging towards the large building.  
"该死的…" 我低着头走向那座巨大的建筑。

Class – 12:30 PM 课程 – 下午 12:30

As always, school was more of a holding pen than it was for actual education. I opted not to talk in the chat room at risk of being caught by the old man, so I settled for playing solitaire instead… which, by the way, I have yet to win a single game. Asuka has tried to message me quite a few times, but every time I just exit the pop up. Finally, after the fifteenth message I closed out of, I feel a pencil hit the back of my head. With a sigh, I open it up to see her, Hikari, Rei, and Kensuke all in the room.  
一如既往，学校更像是个临时拘留所而非真正的教育场所。我选择不在聊天室发言，以免被老头子发现，于是我转而玩起了单人纸牌游戏……顺便说一句，我至今还没赢过一局。明日香尝试给我发过好几次消息，但每次我都直接关闭弹窗。终于，在关闭了第十五次消息后，我感觉有支铅笔砸在了我后脑勺上。我叹了口气，打开聊天窗口，发现她、光、丽和健介都在房间里。

**NERV -** WOOO! NERV - 哇哦！

As predicted, not even five minutes into the conversation I was cut off but the teacher unplugging our computers. Luckily, though, just as he was about to yell the lunch bell rang, and the class was emptier faster than he could blink. I decided against packing a lunch for myself this morning, because of lack of time mostly, but I did manage to make one for both Rei and Asuka. I sit down next to Asuka at the table with the typical group.  
正如预料的那样，谈话开始不到五分钟，老师就拔掉了我们的电脑插头。幸运的是，就在他准备大喊的时候，午餐铃响了，教室里的人比他眨眼的速度还要快地离开了。今天早上我决定不给自己带午餐，主要是因为时间不够，但我还是设法为丽和明日香做了午餐。我坐在明日香旁边的桌子旁，加入了典型的群体。

"I can't believe you people! You actually BET on us?!" Asuka throws a ball of tin foil at a laughing Kensuke.  
“真不敢相信你们这些人！居然真的拿我们打赌？！”明日香将一团锡箔纸扔向笑得前仰后合的健介。

"Well, look at it from our perspective," Hikari took a bite of her sandwich as she spoke, "Shinji was living with both you and Misato, who, may I say, was gone most of the time that you two were home alone. You can't say that something wasn't bound to happen between you two," she does have a point… "Don't be embarrassed, it's really no big deal. I just hope you wore a condom, Shinji!" Hikari laughs, thinking she obviously knows the answer.  
“好吧，从我们的角度来看，”美里边说边咬了一口三明治，“真嗣和你以及美里住在一起，而美里大部分时间都不在家，你们俩单独在家的时候居多。你不能说你们之间不会发生点什么，”她说的确实有道理……“别不好意思，这真的没什么大不了的。我只希望你戴了避孕套，真嗣！”美里笑着说，显然她认为自己已经知道了答案。

"Uh… yeah… can we drop this please?" silence fell over our group after I said that. Not wanting the topic to arise again, I brought up this morning's occurrences, "We're going on Takeshi's Castle again… we might win a car this time."  
“呃……是啊……我们能别提这个了吗？”我说完后，我们这群人陷入了沉默。不想再提起这个话题，我提起了今天早上的事情，“我们又要去挑战《 Takeshi's Castle》了……这次我们可能会赢辆车。”

"SWEET! I wonder if we'll be able to watch you again?" Kensuke was the first to burst out, "When is it?"  
"太棒了！不知道我们还能不能再看你比赛？" 真希波第一个兴奋地喊道，"什么时候？"

"Over winter break. With any luck, I won't get hurt this time," Asuka hands me half of her sandwich, "Here, eat something."  
"寒假期间。希望这次我不会受伤，" 明日香递给我半个三明治，"来，吃点东西。"

"Oh, thanks," without any debate, I take it, "But yeah, the only reason we're going is for the prize," I was actually dreading it. The only good thing that came out of going last time was the whole 'I love you' thing, and even that was more drama than I needed.  
"哦，谢谢，" 我毫不犹豫地接过，"不过说真的，我们去的唯一理由就是为了奖品，" 其实我心里很抵触。上次去唯一值得高兴的就是那句'我爱你'，但那也带来了不少麻烦。

"Wait, aren't you guys going to the semi-finals?" we both nod as we continue to eat, "HA! You're screwed! They hire actual athletes to perform in these things!" I cough as I swallow at Toji's comment, "This'll be real good!"  
"等等，你们不是要去半决赛吗？" 我们俩边吃边点头，"哈！你们完蛋了！他们请了真正的运动员来表演这些！" 听到 Toji 的话，我呛了一下，"这会很有看头的！"

Friday – 8:00 PM 星期五 – 晚上 8 点

A/N – Behold the power of the fifth dimension, where authors can randomly jump through time!  
作者注 – 看那第五维度的力量，作者可以随意穿越时间！

I was sure to pack the essential guards for my essentials, and seeing as I lost a bet to Asuka, I was forced to pack her things as well while she was in the bathroom taking a bath… I would rather not recall exactly how I lost… Rei is over at Paul's house, probably just to drool all over each other, so I was left in this metallic, creepy apartment basically alone outside of the occasional water sounds echoing from inside the bathroom. Gendo said that he would be here by eight-thirty, and knowing him, he'll be exactly one minute late, just for the sake of being late.  
我确保为我的必需品打包了必要的防护措施，而且既然我输给了明日香一个赌注，我被迫在她洗澡时为她打包行李……我宁愿不去回想我是怎么输的……丽现在在保罗家，可能只是为了互相流口水，所以我基本上独自一人留在这个金属质感的、令人毛骨悚然的公寓里，除了偶尔从浴室传来的水声回响。碇司令说他会在八点半到这里，以他的性格，他会恰好晚到一分钟，只是为了显得迟到。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"You know, I'm actually kind of excited about this. I loved how we were able to work together like that before, I'm looking forward to doing it again," I honestly couldn't believe what I was hearing. All week the only thing out of her mouth has been negatives about the trip, and now this?  
“你知道吗，我对这次旅行其实有点兴奋。我喜欢我们之前那样合作无间的感觉，我期待再次那样做，”我简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。整个星期她嘴里说的都是对这次旅行的负面看法，现在却这样说？

"Yeah, same. Actually, you should start getting ready, Gendo's gonna be here soon," in reality, it should only take her ten minutes to get fully dressed and ready to go, but she'll need that extra twenty just to decide what to wear.  
“是啊，一样。实际上，你该开始准备了，源堂很快就会到了，”实际上，她完全打扮好只需要十分钟，但她还需要额外的二十分钟来决定穿什么。

"I've been out of the bath for awhile, the drain is just slow. Haven't you heard me in here?" apparently not… "Hey, do you mind grabbing one of my night shirts for me? I forgot to get one," with a sigh, I opened her bag and got the piece of cloth, only opening the bathroom door a crack to fit my hand and the shirt through, "Oh Jesus Christ," she swung open the door, only wearing shorts, and grabbed the shirt, "Not like you haven't seen it all already!"  
“我已经洗完澡一会儿了，只是排水慢。你没听到我在里面吗？”显然没有……“嘿，你能帮我拿一件睡衣吗？我忘了拿，”我叹了口气，打开她的包，取出那块布料，只把浴室门开了一条缝，把手和睡衣递过去，“哦，天哪，”她猛地打开门，只穿着短裤，抓过睡衣，“反正你早就看光了！”

"… wow…" not exactly the most elegant thing to say, but hey, you weren't there!  
“……哇……”虽然不是最优雅的话，但嘿，你又不在场！

"You'd think that it wouldn't be a big deal anymore…" just to prove a point, she sets aside the shirt while she continues to fiddle with her hair.  
"你可能会觉得这不再是什么大事了……" 为了证明这一点，她把衬衫放在一边，继续摆弄她的头发。

"We're… just going to be sitting in the car for seven or so hours, you don't have to do your hair…" I avert my eyes from her bare back and force myself to the other side of the room.  
"我们……只是要在车里坐上大约七个小时，你不必弄头发……" 我避开她裸露的背部，强迫自己走到房间的另一边。

"I know, but it's just habit, you know? Plus, to this day I've never left home without doing it," she walks out of the bathroom with her shirt on and hair, as always, perfect, "Why are you so nervous around me?" I've only seen her like that once before, how am I supposed to react? "You should consider yourself lucky, most guys would kill to see this!" she held out her arms in emphasis.  
"我知道，但这只是习惯，你知道吗？而且，直到今天我从未不弄头发就出门，" 她穿着衬衫，头发一如既往地完美，从浴室走出来，"你为什么在我面前这么紧张？" 我只见过她那样一次，我该怎么反应？"你应该觉得自己很幸运，大多数男生愿意为此拼命！" 她伸出双臂强调道。

"I know, but it's still just weird…" we had almost this same exact conversation a few days ago, and by the looks of it, it's going to end the same way; her getting frustrated and just dropping it.  
"我知道，但还是觉得怪怪的……" 几天前我们几乎有过一模一样的对话，看样子结局也会一样；她变得沮丧，然后不了了之。

"Well then, we'll just have to fix that, now won't we?" she walks over to me and rests her arms around my neck, "You know, we're going to have our own hotel room again…" she embraces me immediately after letting out that little teaser comment. Melting under her touch, I succumb to my senses and copy the action, putting my hands on her back and forcing her just that much closer.  
"那我们就得解决这个问题，不是吗？" 她走到我身边，手臂环绕在我的脖子上，"你知道，我们又要有自己的酒店房间了……" 她刚说完这个小提示，就立刻拥抱了我。在她触碰下融化，我屈服于感官，模仿她的动作，双手放在她的背上，让她更贴近我。

"Sorry to interrupt," Asuka pulls away from me and stands with her hands behind her back, doing the entire motion in record time, all before looking at an annoyed Gendo, "But we must get going. Grab your bags," without another word, he walks back to the running car and takes his place in the front seat.  
"抱歉打扰一下，" 明日香从我身边拉开，双手背在身后，整个动作快得惊人，还没等不悦的源渡看过来，"但我们必须出发了。拿上你的行李，" 他没再多说一句话，转身回到正在行驶的车上，坐在前排座位上。

"Has he ever come in here without embarrassing us one way or another?"  
"他有没有哪次进来不以某种方式让我们难堪的？"

"I seriously doubt it…" I grab both of our bags as I mumble, heading towards the door with a deep blush on, "Might as well get this over with," throwing the bags into the small trunk, I meet Asuka in the backseat of the car.  
"我严重怀疑……" 我低声咕哝着，抓起我们两人的包，满脸通红地走向门口，"干脆快点结束吧，" 我把包扔进小后备箱，然后在车后座与明日香会合。"

"You ready for some fun?" Gendo was driving this time, and Fuyutsuki turned around just in time to see Asuka putting in ear plugs and laying her head back into the seat, "Well then, aren't we cranky?"  
"准备好找点乐子了吗？" 这次是碇源堂开车，而冬月刚好转过身来，看到明日香塞上耳塞，把头靠在座椅上，"哎呀，我们是不是有点不高兴？"

"Ignore her, she actually wants to do this in a way. So, why were we chosen to play? Weren't we almost kicked off last time?"  
"别理她，她其实挺想这么做的。那么，为什么选我们上场呢？上次不是差点被踢出局吗？"

"Yes, but the president of the company that sponsors Takeshi's Castle said that their ratings have never been higher than when you two were playing, so he's bringing us back… as much as those two men don't want it," I let out a small laugh, "Yeah, they're actually afraid of her. You've got quite a handful there, don't you?"  
"是的，但赞助《 Takeshi's Castle》的公司总裁说，自从你们俩参赛以来，收视率从未如此高涨，所以他要把我们请回来……尽管那两位男士并不情愿，"我轻笑一声，"是啊，他们其实挺怕她的。你可真有福气，不是吗？"

"Not really, she's actually really nice to be around once she gets used to you," which was completely true, "Listen, try not to get on her nerves too much the next few days, she hasn't really been in the best mood since… well, yeah, just watch out," I really had to catch myself there!  
"倒也不尽然，她一旦习惯了你，其实相处起来很愉快，"这话一点不假，"听着，接下来几天尽量别惹她生气，她自从……嗯，你知道的，情绪一直不太好，小心点。"我差点说漏嘴了！"

"Since you two had a little fun you mean?" I just go wide eyed, "You really think that we don't have people watching you twenty-four-seven? You two and Rei are about the most important people in the world, Angels or no; we have to make sure you're safe!"  
"你是说你们俩玩得挺开心？" 我瞪大了眼睛，"你真以为我们不会全天候监视你们吗？你和丽，不管有没有使徒，都是世界上最重要的人，我们必须确保你们的安全！"

"Don't let Asuka you know… please…"  
"别让明日香知道……拜托了……"

"Naturally." "当然。"

"I still don't approve of your relationship, however," Gendo had to throw in his two cents, "I believe that it will affect you if there is a future in piloting, but Major Katsuragi convinced me otherwise."  
"我仍然不赞成你们的关系，不过，" 碇司令总得插上两句，"我认为这会影响你未来的驾驶员生涯，但葛城美里少校说服了我。"

"Thanks for your support," copying Asuka's action, I put in a set of earplugs and rest my head. While my eyes were closed for the next five hours, I was far from sleeping – too many things on my mind… that and I couldn't get comfortable to save my life. Asuka, however, has long since been sleeping, and only recently she let her head fall onto my shoulder. For awhile, I didn't make a move in fear that Gendo would say something, but something went off in my head that just said 'fuck it'. I rested my head on her conditioned hair and place my hand on top of hers, which was sitting ideally on the space between us… thankfully, nothing was said. Once I was in this position, the smell of her under me and the sensory of our contact put me out like a light. This, however, was short lived, as we arrived at our destination soon after, two hours later. I was harshly woken up by Gendo throwing a card and bags on my lap.  
"谢谢你的支持，" 我模仿着明日香的动作，塞入一副耳塞，然后靠在椅背上。尽管接下来的五小时里我闭着眼睛，却远未入睡——脑中思绪纷繁，而且我怎么也找不到舒服的姿势。明日香倒是早已熟睡，最近她的头还靠在了我的肩上。起初，我一动也不敢动，生怕碇司令会说些什么，但内心有个声音突然冒出来说'管他呢'。我将头靠在她打理得一丝不苟的头发上，把手放在她搭在我们之间的手上……幸好，什么也没发生。一旦进入这个状态，她身上的香气和我们的接触感让我瞬间入睡。然而，这短暂的宁静很快就被打破了，因为不久后我们抵达了目的地，两小时后，碇司令粗暴地用一张卡片和几个袋子把我砸醒。

"Wake up. There's your room key and your things; rest up, we leave tomorrow at dawn," before I even opened my eyes, he was walking away towards the only room with the light on at the cheap hotel.  
“醒醒。这是你的房间钥匙和你的东西；休息一下，我们明早天亮出发。” 我还没睁开眼，他就朝着那家廉价酒店里唯一亮着灯的房间走去。

"Asuka, we're here," I nudge her awake, "Come on," taking her hand in mine, I guide her out of the car and close the door with my foot.  
“明日香，我们到了。” 我轻轻推醒她，“来吧。” 我握住她的手，领她下车，用脚关上车门。

"Took long enough…" she yawned as the back of her hand made contact with her eye, "What time is it?"  
“终于到了……” 她打着哈欠，用手背揉了揉眼睛，“现在几点了？”

"No idea, but it's late, let's go to bed," after stumbling around aimlessly for ten minutes, we finally found our room ironically numbered '0102'. She fell onto the old bed face first as I threw our bags in the chair next to the door. Unlike last time, there was no problem that there was only one bed, so I lie next to her, not bothering to cover ourselves up, and drift off to sleep after turning off the light.  
“不知道，但天色已晚，我们睡觉吧，”在漫无目的地摸索了十分钟后，我们终于找到了我们的房间，讽刺的是门牌号是‘0102’。她一头栽倒在老旧的床上，而我则把我们的包扔在门边的椅子上。与上次不同，这次只有一张床也没什么问题，于是我躺在了她旁边，懒得盖被子，关灯后便沉沉睡去。

Regardless of the fact that I was fast asleep, my mind was still racing over what might happen over the next two days. Unlike last time, this is a four day long competition, so we're in it for the long haul. I didn't really mind performing those moronic stunts last time, the only thing I hated was the constant disrespect towards Asuka; they never once gave her a break. I mean sure, maybe she was asking for it at some points, but really, you'd think that they would be at least slightly nicer seeing as we're helping them.  
尽管我已熟睡，脑海中仍在飞速思考接下来两天的可能发生的事情。与上次不同，这是一场为期四天的比赛，所以我们得做好持久战的准备。上次那些愚蠢的特技表演我并不介意，唯一让我反感的是他们对明日香的不尊重；他们从未给她片刻喘息的机会。我的意思是，当然，也许她在某些时候是自找的，但说真的，考虑到我们在帮助他们，你以为他们会稍微友善一些。

"Shinji," it seemed as if I barely got to sleep when she was waking me up with a soft voice. I crack my eyes to see her laying next to me, smiling and her eyes half closed, "We have to get up, it's almost eleven," that was probably the most beautiful sight I've seen in my entire life.  
"真嗣," 仿佛我刚入睡不久，她就用柔和的声音唤醒了我。我睁开眼睛，看到她躺在我身边，微笑着，眼睛半闭，"我们得起床了，已经快十一点了，"那大概是我一生中见过的最美丽的景象。

Hotel – 11:30 AM 酒店 – 上午 11:30

So far, this morning has been… eventful. It started out amazing with her gently waking me up, allowing her face to be the first thing I saw, but that was about the only thing normal. As always, she was the first to take a shower, and I couldn't really do anything until I had a shower myself, so I was currently just on the bed watching some Discovery Channel show about bears… yeah, couldn't really care less about them. The water from inside the bathroom just recently turned off, and I already had my towel in hand ready to take her place. The door opened, letting a puff of steam shoot into the room.  
今天早上到目前为止……真是多事之秋。一开始美妙极了，她温柔地唤醒我，让她的脸成为我睁眼看到的第一个景象，但这几乎是唯一正常的事情。一如既往，她先去洗澡，而我直到自己洗完澡才能做其他事，所以我目前只是躺在床上看着探索频道关于熊的节目……是的，我对它们实在没什么兴趣。浴室里的水刚停，我已经拿着毛巾准备接替她的位置。门开了，一股蒸汽随之涌入房间。

"Hope you saved some hot water for me," I stood up just as she was exiting the bathroom, and my knees instantly gave out at the sight, sending me right back down onto the bed. Obviously concerning the recent conversation about me being comfortable around her, she walked out of the bathroom completely naked outside of the towel in her hands, still drying herself off.  
"希望你给我留了些热水，" 我刚站起来，她正好从浴室出来，我一看到她，膝盖立刻发软，又跌坐回床上。显然，考虑到我们最近关于我在她身边感到自在的对话，她走出浴室时除了手中的毛巾外一丝不挂，还在擦干身体。

"I did, now hurry up, we don't have much longer."  
"我留了，快点，我们时间不多了。"

"Y-Yeah…" I struggle to stand up and force myself to walk past her and into the bathroom, the door of which was of course being blocked by her foot. I look up at her face, which was crowned by strands of wet hair.  
"好-好的…" 我挣扎着站起来，强迫自己走过她身边进入浴室，当然，门被她的脚挡住了。我抬头看她的脸，湿漉漉的头发贴在额头上。

"By the end of this little trip, you will get over your nervousness," with a wink, she went about her business of fixing her hair, still not wearing anything. I sigh as I close the door, realizing that she was right; name a guy that wouldn't kill to see that without going to the hospital afterwards. The shower was short lived due to the lack of cold water – which, by the way, solved a very different problem – and I was back in the room, fully clothed, within twenty minutes. When I walked out, I thankfully saw a fully clothed Asuka… God, did I just say that?  
"这次小旅行结束时，你会克服紧张的，"她眨了眨眼，继续整理头发，依然一丝不挂。我叹了口气关上门，意识到她说得对；想想哪个男人不想看到那一幕，哪怕事后得进医院。由于没有冷水，淋浴很快就结束了——顺便解决了另一个问题——我在二十分钟内就穿好衣服回到了房间。当我走出去时，庆幸地看到穿着整齐的明日香……天啊，我刚才是这么说的吗？

"At least you didn't wear a white t-shirt this time," she was in a black tank top with sun-faded jeans.  
"至少这次你没穿白 T 恤，"她穿着一件黑色背心和褪色的牛仔裤。

"Yeah, I made sure of that. This is NOT going to be a repeat of last time…" I walk to the fridge and grab a water, taking a drink from it almost immediately, "So yeah, Gendo was here when you were in the shower. He said to meet him down at the car when we were ready, so let's just get this over with," without waiting for me, she stands up and heads out the door, forcing me to chase after her.  
"是啊，我确保了这一点。这次绝不会再重蹈覆辙……"我走到冰箱前拿了一瓶水，立刻喝了一口，"对了，你洗澡时碇源堂来过。他说我们准备好后就到车那边见他，所以我们就赶紧搞定吧，"没等我回应，她站起来走出房门，我只好追了上去。

"Didn't you say that you were excited about this?" I see Gendo waiting in the car with Fuyutsuki.  
"你不是说你对这个很兴奋吗？"我看到源堂在车里等着，旁边是冬月。

"No, I said I was excited about working with you, not actually competing. I hate all the publicity, but hey, how can you argue with free stuff?" yeah, that's if we win…  
"不，我说的是和你一起工作很兴奋，不是真的去比赛。我讨厌所有的宣传，但嘿，免费的奖品你怎么能拒绝呢？"是啊，前提是我们得赢……

"Good point," we head out to that old car and climb in the back, both of us realizing that it's taking us to hell.  
"说得好，"我们走向那辆旧车，爬进后座，两人都意识到这正带我们走向地狱。

"Took you two long enough," in his painfully typical monotone voice, Gendo starts the car and pulls out of the parking lot, "Now listen Asuka; this is a much more formal competition than last time. If you break one rule, even one, they won't hesitate to kick us out."  
"你们俩可真够慢的，" 他用那惯常的、令人痛苦的单调声音说道，启动了汽车，驶出停车场，"现在听好了，明日香；这次比赛比上次正式得多。如果你违反了一条规则，哪怕一条，他们也会毫不犹豫地把我们赶出去。"

"Why are you only talking to me?! Shinji's the one that didn't play the challenged right!"  
"为什么只跟我说？！真嗣才是那个没正确应对挑战的人！"

"I was just being smart about it. They never said how to do it, they just said do it."  
"我只是聪明应对罢了。他们没说具体怎么做，只说要做。"

"So what, now I'm not smart?" oh Jesus Christ…  
"那又怎样，我现在就不聪明了？" 哦天哪……

Stadium 体育场

We were just entering the giant coliseum-style stadium where the words 'Takeshi's Castle' were painted on banners that decorated the exterior walls. I hear Asuka let out a long sigh as we make our way to the overly extravagant red doors with the two hosts' faces on either side, each with a huge, typical smile on. The doors seemed to open on their own as we approached to reveal the two hosts sitting in large 'golden' chairs on pedestals.  
我们正步入那个巨大的圆形剧场式体育场，外墙上装饰着写有'武的城堡'字样的横幅。我听到明日香长叹一声，当我们走向那扇装饰过度的红色大门时，门上两侧分别绘有两名主持人的面孔，都带着夸张的笑容。当我们走近时，大门似乎自动打开了，露出两位主持人坐在高高的'金色'椅子上，椅子立在基座上。

"Ah! Our first guests have… son of a bitch, cut the camera. I said cut it!" the man in blue hurled a nearby rock at the camera man, "Who invited you?! We were promised that you wouldn't be coming back!"  
"啊！我们的第一位客人已经……该死的，关掉摄像机。我说了关掉它！" 蓝衣男子抓起一块附近的石头扔向摄像师，"谁邀请你的？！我们被告知你不会再回来了！"

"I quit," the man in red stands up with his eyes closed and walks away.  
"我辞职了，" 红衣男子闭着眼睛站起身，径直走开。"

"Well that's just great, see what you two do?" Asuka plants on a small smirk, "And just what do you think you're smiling at?! There's nothing humorous about this!"  
"真是太好了，看看你们俩干的好事？" 明日香露出一丝狡黠的微笑，"你笑什么笑？！这有什么好笑的！"

"With him gone, that means you must be playing the role of Takeshi…" his eyes go wide.  
"他走了，那就意味着你得扮演猛的角色了……" 他的眼睛瞪得大大的。

"How can there be so much evil in such a little girl…?" with a deep sigh, he stands up and somehow puts on that talk show host persona, "Okay, start rolling again!" after a few moments, he whips out a microphone from seemingly nowhere and looks into the lens, "And we're back! The first contestants of the day have arrived. They're returning challengers with a pas history of doing quite well on the course! Meet your first celebrities, Shinji Ikari and Asuka… I can't read that…"  
"这么小的女孩怎么会有这么多邪恶……？" 他深深叹了口气，站起身来，不知怎的又戴上了脱口秀主持人的面具，"好了，重新开始拍摄！" 片刻后，他不知从哪儿掏出一个麦克风，对着镜头说道，"我们回来了！今天的首位参赛者已经就位。他们是重返赛场的挑战者，过往在赛道上表现不俗！来认识一下今天的明星选手，碇真嗣和……我读不出来……"

"Soryu!" she yells from behind the camera.  
"惣流！" 她在摄像机后喊道。

"Soryu! That's right! You may know them from saving your sorry asses on a weekly basis! We also have their two superiors, Mr. Ikari and Mr. Fuyutsuki!" superiors? He walks over to Asuka and I and puts his arm around my shoulders, "So, how does it feel to be back on the show kids?"  
"Soryu! 没错！你们可能每周都在救你们那可怜的屁股时见过他们！我们还有他们的两位上级，碇先生和冬月先生！" 上级？他走到我和明日香身边，把手臂搭在我的肩膀上，"那么，孩子们，回到节目上感觉如何？"

"It feels like a concussion if you don't take your hands off of him," still smiling at the camera, he did as he was told.  
"如果你不把手从他身上拿开，感觉就像脑震荡一样，" 他依旧对着镜头微笑，照做了。"

"And that's why we keep bringing them back folks! Strong willed! They'll need it to go up against the other celebrities!"  
"这就是为什么我们不断邀请他们回来，各位！意志坚强！他们需要这样的意志去对抗其他名人！"

"Wait, what? Celebrities?" once again, Asuka speaks to the man in blue, "I thought this was the semi-finals!"  
"等等，什么？名人？" 阿斯卡再次对蓝衣男子说道，"我以为这是半决赛！"

"It is, but none of the other contestants would come back, so we just decided to have the semi-finals include only washed up celebrities! Actually, here's another contestant now!" I turn to see a black man – at least in his fifties – in a solid purple suit with an obnoxious large analog clock hanging around his neck. All of his teeth were gold, as shown by the giant smile, and he walked with a step that just screamed 'clap'.  
"确实是半决赛，但其他选手都不愿意回来，所以我们决定让半决赛只包括过气名人！实际上，现在又来了一位选手！" 我转头看到一个黑人——至少五十多岁——穿着一件纯紫色西装，脖子上挂着一个夸张的大号模拟时钟。他所有的牙齿都是金的，从他那巨大的笑容中可以看出，他走路的步伐让人忍不住想鼓掌。

"Who the hell is that?" Asuka actually looked discusted!  
"那家伙到底是谁？" 阿斯卡看起来真的感到厌恶！

"I can't believe this guy is still alive…" I hear her mumble through her hand covering her face.  
"真不敢相信这家伙还活着……" 我听到她用手捂着脸喃喃自语。

"What up little man?" he put out his hand to shake mine, and out of habit, I copy the action, "Gotta say, never thought I'd be back on TV again! Flavor's making a comeback!" flavor?  
"最近怎么样，小兄弟？" 他伸出手来和我握手，出于习惯，我也模仿了这个动作，"得说，从没想过我还能再上电视！Flavor 要东山再起了！" Flavor？

"Ah yes, and here is our second celebrity of the day; Flavor Flav! He may be pushing seventy years old, but hey, this guy can still pop out illegitimate children like he was back in the eighties! So, how does it feel to be here?"  
"啊，是的，今天我们的第二位名人登场了；Flavor Flav！虽然他已年近七十，但嘿，这家伙还能像八十年代那样不断生出私生子！那么，来到这里感觉如何？"

"Well Host-Man, I got one thing to say…" he puts his hand on the man in blue's shoulder, "Is there a bathroom around here? I really gotta shi-"  
"好吧，主持人先生，我有一句话要说……" 他把手放在穿蓝衣服的男人肩上，"这附近有洗手间吗？我真的急着要……"

"AND we'll be right back after this commercial break!" the camera man put down his equipment, "Okay, listen here you little ghetto rat; this is a family show. The more you cuss, the more higher-ups ride my ass for letting you do it!"  
"广告之后我们马上回来！" 摄像师放下设备，"听着，你这个小混混；这是家庭节目。你越骂人，高层就越找我麻烦，怪我让你这么干！"

"It's okay, I like a little mustache every now and then myself!" with an immature laugh, Flavor slaps the host's back and walks away, "I'll be back, gotta find me a razorblade and some glass!"  
"没关系，我自己偶尔也喜欢留点小胡子！" Flavor 带着幼稚的笑声拍了拍主持人的背，走开了，"我一会儿就回来，得去找个剃须刀和玻璃片！"

"I hate my life… so very much right now…" Asuka still had her hand covering her face as she spoke.  
"我讨厌我的生活……此刻真是讨厌透顶……" 明日香依旧用手遮着脸说道。

"I found him amusing. I remember watching his show as an adolescent; Flavor of Love I believe it was called. After that show, an estimated eighty percent of ghettos were filled with his children… quite impressive, I must say," and Asuka calls ME a pervert; look at Fuyutsuki!  
"我觉得他挺有趣的。记得青春期时看过他的节目；好像是《爱的味道》。那节目之后，估计有百分之八十的贫民区都充满了他的孩子……不得不说，真厉害，" 明日香居然说我是变态；看看冬月！

"Listen, why don't you go stand in the sidelines for now? We'll be starting in about ten minutes, we just have to wait for the rest of the contestants… oh! Get the camera rolling! We have another arrival!" Asuka and I turn to see a much younger Asian man walking through the gates in a snow-white leather suit with a cocky smile on his face, "I believe Rain has arrived! Sporting his old Speed Racer outfit to boot!"  
"听着，你现在先去场边待着吧？我们大约十分钟后开始，就等其他参赛者了……哦！开始拍摄！又有新人来了！" 明日香和我转身看到一个更年轻的亚洲男子穿着雪白的皮衣，面带得意的微笑穿过入口，"看来 Rain 到了！还穿着他那套《极速赛车手》的旧装呢！"

"Ah yes, the guy that made a bad name for Asians across the United States, how wonderful…" finally, Gendo speaks up.  
"啊，没错，那个让全美国亚洲人蒙羞的家伙，真是太棒了……" 终于，碇司令开口了。

"Why don't I know any of these people?!" unable to keep quiet any longer, I burst out, "We already have a pimp named Flavor, and now a dude with weather for a name?!"  
"为什么我一个都不认识？！" 我再也忍不住了，爆发道，"我们已经有个叫 Flavor 的皮条客了，现在又来个名字像天气的家伙？！"

"I know, calm down…" sarcastically, Asuka pets me on the head, "It'll all be over soon enough."  
"我知道，冷静点……" 明日香讽刺地拍拍我的头，"很快就会结束的。"

"I believe I saw Chan getting out of his car, someone might want to go help him," the camera man and host run off to the parking lot to meet up with the only man whose name I actually recognize, "And who do we have here?" Rain puts out his hand in front of me, and upon shaking his hand, he displays just how feminine a handshake can be done.  
"我好像看到陈从他的车里出来了，可能需要有人去帮他一下，" 摄像师和主持人跑向停车场去迎接我唯一认识的那个人，"我们这里是谁呢？" Rain 伸出手挡在我面前，握手时，他展示了女性化的握手方式。

"Shinji Ikari… I'm sorry, but who are you?"  
"碇真嗣…对不起，但你是谁？"

"Real name's Jeong, but everyone calls me Rain. And excuse me for not knowing you Mr. Ikari! I would like to thank you very much for all you've done!" well, I guess this guy isn't TOO bad… that is until he takes Asuka's hand and kissed the top of it, "And what an honor to meet the beautiful Asuka Soryu!" before I did anything, she met her knee with his groin.  
"真名是郑，但大家都叫我 Rain。请原谅我不认识你，碇先生！非常感谢你所做的一切！" 嗯，我想这家伙还不算太糟…直到他握住明日香的手并亲吻了她的手背，"能见到美丽的惣流·明日香，真是荣幸！" 在我做出任何反应之前，她用膝盖顶了他的下体。

"Back off scumbag, you're more than twice my age," without a word, he limped away and sat on one of the steps that made the podium where the man in blue was sitting, "I'm letting you know right now Gendo, if absolutely anything sexual happens to me on this little game again, you'll be the one to pay," crossing her arms, she walks away, "I'm going to find a bathroom, I'll be back."  
"滚开，混蛋，你年纪都够当我两倍大了，"他一言不发，一瘸一拐地走开，坐在了蓝色衣服男子所坐讲台的台阶上，"我这就告诉你，碇，如果这次小游戏中再有任何性骚扰的事发生在我身上，你可得负责，"她交叉双臂，转身离开，"我要去找个洗手间，马上回来。"

"Well isn't she is a great mood…" I overhear Fuyutsuki speaking quietly to Gendo. What did they expect? They were both very aware that she would have rather spend the break in school than come on this damned death wish trip.  
"她心情可真差啊……"我无意中听到冬月低声对碇说。他们能指望什么呢？两人都很清楚，她宁愿在学校里休息，也不想来参加这个该死的寻死之旅。

"Uh, Mr. Ikari?" a woman walks up to us holding a clipboard, "Is one of you Mr. Ikari?" Gendo walks up and shakes the woman's hand.  
"呃，碇先生？"一位女士拿着夹板向我们走来，"你们中哪位是碇先生？"碇走上前去与那位女士握手。

"Can I help you?" "需要帮忙吗？"

"I'm sorry, I've got some bad news. One of the hosts is threatening to sue the department for endangerment, claiming your group to be the cause… personally, I don't see an issue, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave," I see his eyebrows pop up above his glasses.  
"很抱歉，我有一些坏消息。其中一位主持人威胁要因危害行为起诉部门，声称你们小组是原因……我个人不觉得有问题，但我不得不请你们离开，" 我看到他的眉毛在他眼镜上方挑起。

"Ma'am, we were invited to this by your superiors."  
"女士，我们是贵部门上级邀请来的。"

"Yes, well, they're telling you to leave… if we must call security, we will."  
"是的，他们在让你离开……如果我们必须叫保安，我们会这么做。"

"Well then, appears as if you've made up your mind. Shinji, please go find Miss Soryu, meet me back at the car," without another word, he turns around and heads towards the parking lot with Fuyutsuki trailing slightly behind.  
"那么，看来你已经决定了。真嗣，请去找丽小姐，我们在车上见，"他没再多说一句话，转身朝停车场走去，冬月稍微跟在后面。"

"Well ain't that a bitch?" the host in Red walks up to me with a large, arrogant smirk on, "Looks like your little lover just screwed your chances of winning so much as a ride home!"  
"哎呀，这不是糟糕透顶吗？"红衣主持人带着一副傲慢的大笑向我走来，"看来你的小情人刚刚毁了你赢取哪怕是一趟回家的车的机会！"

"Neither of us really wanted to be here to tell you the truth," his smile quickly fades, "Actually, you're doing us a favor."  
“说实话，我们俩其实都不太想来这儿，”他的笑容迅速消失，“实际上，你倒是帮了我们一个大忙。”

"But… but what about the prizes?!"  
“但是……那奖品怎么办？！”

"We work for NERV, remember? If we pushed hard enough, we could get a car just for payment."  
“我们为 NERV 工作，记得吗？如果我们争取一下，光是报酬就能拿到一辆车。”

"I hate you two… so very much…" he walks up to his chair and sits down, looking too much like a four year old than necessary. Right on cue, I see Asuka walking up to me through the crowd.  
"我恨你们俩……非常非常恨……" 他走向自己的椅子坐下，那模样比实际年龄四岁还要幼稚。就在这时，我看到明日香穿过人群向我走来。

"Where'd they go?" she looks back at the man in red for a moment, then simply shrugs it off.  
"他们去哪儿了？" 她回头看了一眼红衣男子，然后只是耸了耸肩。

"We have to go home, something about him being scared of you," her eyes lit up with a glimmering anticipation.  
"我们得回家了，好像是他怕你，" 她的眼中闪烁着期待的光芒。

"That's great! Damn, I've been regretting coming here since I got in the hotel!" with a sarcastic wave to the man behind her, we make our way out to the old car in the parking lot, "You know, I wanted the car and all, but after I got thinking, they would probably come up with some crappy excuse as to why we couldn't have it… you didn't want to stay, right?"  
"太好了！该死，自从进了酒店我就一直在后悔来这儿！"她带着讽刺的语气向身后的人挥了挥手，我们走向停车场里的那辆旧车，"你知道，我本来想要那辆车，但后来想想，他们可能会找些蹩脚的借口不让我们开走……你也不想留在这儿，对吧？"

"Well, I didn't want to stay HERE, but I did want to do something. I just know that we're going to be bored to tears this break," she just shrugs and takes my hand.  
"嗯，我是不想待在这儿，但我确实想做点什么。我只是知道这个假期我们会无聊到哭，"她只是耸了耸肩，握住了我的手。"

"I'm sure we can find something to do…" with a wink and a smile, we continue walking towards the car.  
"我相信我们能找到事情做的……"她眨了眨眼，微笑着，我们继续向车子走去。"

Toji's House 冬二的家

"What the hell is this?!"  
“这到底是什么鬼？！”

"How… disappointing…" “多么……令人失望……”

Three Hours Later – Rei's Apartment  
三小时后 – 丽的小公寓

Oddly enough, Gendo didn't seem too upset about the whole issue. In fact, he seemed completely fine with it. Asuka, even more strange, didn't just fall asleep this time. While she did keep quiet most of the time, she did start and end conversations every now and then. When we got home, we were met with an empty apartment with a few random clothes thrown on the floor.  
说来也怪，碇司令对整个事件似乎并不太在意。实际上，他看起来完全没问题。更奇怪的是，明日香这次没有直接睡着。虽然她大部分时间都保持沉默，但偶尔还是会开始和结束对话。当我们回到家时，迎接我们的是一个空荡荡的公寓，地上散落着几件随意扔下的衣服。

"Rei's at NERV with Ritsuko having a few tests run," Asuka throws her bag on the bed and begins unpacking.  
“丽和律子在 NERV 做些测试，”明日香把包扔到床上，开始整理东西。

"How'd you know that?" she points to a note on the dresser without turning around, "Oh…" copying her action, I place my bag on the bed and unpack a little less gracefully as her. I've never really been one to organize clothes according to type…  
"你怎么知道的？" 她指着梳妆台上的一张纸条，没有转身，"哦……" 我模仿她的动作，把包放在床上，不太优雅地开始整理衣物。我从来不是那种会按类型整理衣服的人……

"I wonder why she's having tests run. I mean really, what could possibly happen at this point? All of the angels are dead, so… oh screw it, like NERV ever made sense in the first place," holding something in her hand, she entered the bathroom and shut the door behind her. I lay back on my bed next to a now empty bag and close my eyes… which was extremely short lived, "Hey Shinji, come on," throwing a piece of cloth onto my stomach, she walks over to the dresser and fumbles around inside of it, "Might as well do something. Let's go to the lake, I could use a decent tan," so that's what she was doing! She was still in her normal clothes, but I could see the top of her two-piece sticking out of her shirt.  
"我想知道她为什么要做检查。我是说，现在还能发生什么呢？所有的天使都死了，所以……哦，管它呢，NERV 从一开始就不合理，" 她手里拿着什么东西，走进了浴室，关上了门。我躺在床上，旁边是一个空包，闭上了眼睛……但很快就结束了，"嘿，真嗣，快点，" 她把一块布扔到我肚子上，走到梳妆台前，在里面摸索着，"反正也没事做。我们去湖边吧，我需要好好晒个太阳，" 原来她是这么打算的！她还穿着平常的衣服，但我能看到她的比基尼上衣从衬衫里露出来。

"Oh, okay…" still a little flustered, I grab the swimming shorts she threw on me and decide to just carry them down there, "Told you we'd get bored quick…"  
"哦，好吧……" 我还是有点慌乱，拿起她扔给我的泳裤，决定就这么带着它们去，"告诉你我们会很快无聊的……"

"Oh shut up, we'll find something to do. Let's go," I grab a normal towel, not having enough time to find a beach one, and follow her out of the apartment, "Why didn't you just change in the bathroom?"  
"哦，闭嘴，我们总能找到事情做的。走吧，" 我抓了一条普通毛巾，来不及找沙滩用的，就跟她出了公寓，"你干嘛不在浴室换衣服？"

"Like I need to display my chicken legs to the world – I'll just change behind a tree or something, thanks," I force a short lived laugh out of her.  
"我可不想向全世界展示我的鸡腿——我就在树后面换吧，谢了，" 我勉强逗得她短暂地笑了笑。"

"You don't have chicken legs, you're just really lanky," I just shrug it off – doesn't really matter to me, "It's been a little while since we went down here, hasn't it?"  
"你才不是鸡腿呢，只是特别瘦长，" 我耸耸肩，这对我来说无所谓，"我们有一阵子没来这儿了吧？"

"A couple of weeks I guess… we're only going because we'll be bored to tears otherwise…"  
"大概几周吧……我们只是因为不去的话会无聊到死才去的……"

"Jesus Shinji, can't you ever make small talk without being so negative?" I don't think I'm negative, I'm just a realist, "You know, you better shake this whole 'boredom' thing. The more you say it, the worse it'll get."  
"天啊，真嗣，你就不能聊点轻松的话题，非得这么消极吗？" 我不觉得自己消极，只是个现实主义者，"你知道的，你最好摆脱这种'无聊'的想法。你越说它，情况只会越糟。"

"Well yeah, but-" "嗯，是啊，但是-"

"What did I just say? No buts!" she sounds exactly like Misato right now, "Look, I promise we won't get bored, okay? We'll find something to do!" after her empty promise, we idly chat until we finally rounded the hill that revealed that huge manmade lake, "I have to admit, I missed this place," she grabbed the towel from me and flipped it out onto the shore about ten feet from the water line, "You gonna get changed or what?" without looking back, she speaks to me as she disrobes to reveal a black bikini.  
"我刚说什么来着？没有但是！" 她现在听起来简直和美里一模一样，"听着，我保证我们不会无聊的，好吗？我们会找点事情做！" 在她空洞的承诺之后，我们闲聊着，直到终于绕过了那座小山，露出了那片巨大的人工湖，"我得承认，我想念这个地方，" 她从我手中抢过毛巾，甩到离水边大约十英尺的岸上，"你还不去换衣服吗？" 她一边脱下衣服，露出黑色的比基尼，一边头也不回地对我说。

"Yeah," following her indirect command, I take my place behind a fairly large tree and quickly change, knowing that she had something planned – there's no way she just decided to come to the lake simply to get a tan. With my clothes in hand, I walk out to see her already lying on her back, one leg bend at the knee into the air, "Well you didn't take long to get comfortable."  
"好的，" 我遵从她间接的指示，找了一棵相当大的树作为掩护，迅速换好衣服，心里明白她一定有什么计划——她不可能只是为了晒太阳就决定来湖边。手里拿着换下的衣服，我走出去，看到她已经仰面躺着，一条腿弯曲，膝盖朝天，"你倒是挺快就放松下来了。"

"What? I'm not allowed to relax every now and then? Come on," she patted the spot next to her, "We both could use some R and R."  
"什么？我偶尔放松一下也不行吗？来吧，" 她拍了拍旁边的位置，"我们俩都需要点休息和放松。"

Without a word, I lay next to her on my back, staring up at the same blue sky she was. The soft sounds of the water breaking against the small rocks on the shore along with the mild rustling of trees in the wind put me in a euphoric state almost immediately. I actually almost fell asleep within the first five minutes, but the feeling of her hand gliding into mine woke me up and put a small smile on my face. We were like this for quite awhile until she rolled onto her side, facing me. I followed the action to see her with closed eyes, a few strands of red crossing her face. Deciding I could relax, I close my eyes along with her, scooting in slightly towards her. After a few minutes, I feel her squeezing my hand slightly, and I open my eyes to see her two powder blue orbs staring right back at me. Purely out of coincidence, we both move in closer at the same time, forcing half a smile out of the two of us. Our foreheads were touching, and I could feel her breath beating against my lips. We stared at each other for awhile, never loosening the hold on our hands, until she finally put her other hand on my cheek. Moving in, I peck her on the lips; nothing more, but it was more romantic than any other kiss could have possibly been. With a gentle smile, she once again closes her eyes.  
我一言不发，在她身旁仰躺下来，与她一同凝视着同一片蔚蓝天空。水波轻柔地拍打着岸边的小石子，微风中树木的沙沙声，几乎立刻让我进入了愉悦的状态。实际上，我差点在前五分钟内就睡着了，但她的手滑入我的手中，唤醒了我，让我脸上浮现出一抹微笑。我们就这样躺了许久，直到她侧身转向我。我跟着她的动作，看到她闭着眼睛，几缕红发横过她的脸庞。我决定放松下来，便闭上眼睛，稍稍向她靠近。几分钟后，我感觉到她轻轻捏了捏我的手，睁开眼，看到她那双淡蓝色的眼眸正凝视着我。纯属巧合，我们同时向对方靠近，让彼此的嘴角都露出了半分笑意。我们的额头相触，我能感受到她呼吸轻拂过我的唇。我们凝视着对方，手始终紧握，直到她终于用另一只手轻抚我的脸颊。 我靠近她，轻轻吻在她的唇上；没有更多，但这个吻比任何其他吻都更浪漫。她带着温柔的微笑，再次闭上了眼睛。

While I didn't exactly fall asleep, she definitely did. It took her about ten minutes after rolling onto her back again to do so, leaving me copying the action, simply staring at the sky. For the first time in I don't even know how long, I was able to just let my mind relax. Not necessarily thinking about anything, I have to admit, is pretty nice after awhile.  
虽然我并没有真正入睡，但她确实睡着了。她在翻身仰躺后大约十分钟就进入了梦乡，留下我模仿她的动作，只是凝视着天空。我已经很久不知道有多久没有这样让我的思绪放松了。不得不承认，什么都不想，过一段时间确实挺好的。

"You asleep?" okay, so maybe she was awake…  
“你睡着了吗？”好吧，也许她醒着……

"No, I thought you were," a few moments of semi-awkward silence pass, simply because neither of us knew what to say next, "Were you disappointed about not competing at that show?"  
"不，我以为你是，"几秒钟的半尴尬沉默过去，只是因为我们俩都不知道接下来该说什么，"你对没能参加那场比赛感到失望吗？"

"Doesn't really matter to me one way or the other. Sure, I could have gotten a car out of it, but it's not like I just can't call my stepmother and play the pity card. She may not like me too much, but for some reason she does spoil me… that and she's LOADED," then why were we even there?!  
"对我来说无所谓。当然，我本可以从那儿得到一辆车，但我又不是不能打电话给我继母，打同情牌。她可能不太喜欢我，但出于某种原因她确实宠我……再加上她很有钱，"那我们为什么还要去那里？！"

"Yeah, what about her? You've never really told me about any of that… come to think of it, you've never told me anything from when you lived in Germany," the most she's ever said is that she wouldn't see her stepmother as the real thing.  
"是啊，她怎么了？你从没真正告诉过我那些事……仔细想想，你从没告诉过我你在德国生活时的任何事情，"她最多只说过她不会把继母当成真正的人。"

"There's really nothing to tell, you already know everything. My father got re-married almost right after my mother died, and then I lived with them for awhile before moving here. I never really enjoyed either one's company, but hey, it's not like they neglected me or anything. She calls me every now and then, but my father never does – I think he's made it pretty clear he doesn't want anything to do with me. Frankly, I'm fine with that, he was just a playboy anyway," she lets out a small laugh, "You know, the only reason he still has the same wife is because – by her own words – he's good in bed. She knows he cheats on her, and she doesn't really care, not like they spend time together anyway. I have to say though, I don't miss that place at all. I thought it was great while I lived there, but after I moved here and got used to the sun… it sucked! Cold all the time, every store reeks of alcohol, and… did I mention it was cold?" she once again laughs.  
"真的没什么可说的，你已经知道所有的事了。我妈去世后不久，我爸就再婚了，然后我跟他们住了一段时间，才搬到这里。我其实并不喜欢他们中的任何一个，但也没被忽视什么的。她偶尔会给我打电话，但我爸从没打过——我想他已经很明确地表示不想和我有任何瓜葛。说实话，我无所谓，反正他也就是个花花公子，"她轻笑一声，"你知道吗，他之所以还留着同一个老婆，按她自己的话说，就是他在床上很厉害。她知道他在外面乱搞，但她不在乎，反正他们也不怎么在一起。不过我得说，我一点也不怀念那个地方。虽然住在那里时觉得挺好，但搬到这里习惯了阳光之后……那地方简直糟透了！总是那么冷，每家店都弥漫着酒味，还有……我是不是说过那里很冷？"她再次笑了起来。

"You always spoke so highly of it, I assumed it was Eden to you," she rolls her eyes with a smile as my phone rings from a few feet away in my pants pocket, "Hold on," forcing myself to my feet only to realize my arm was asleep, I stumble over to the loose cloth and force the plastic rectangle from it, "Hello?" I had a slightly annoyed tone, but not intentionally.  
"你总是对它赞不绝口，我还以为对你来说它就是伊甸园呢，" 她笑着翻了个白眼，这时我的手机从几英尺外裤子的口袋里响起，"稍等一下，" 我强迫自己站起来，却发现手臂已经麻了，我踉跄着走到那块松散的布料旁，用力从里面拽出那个塑料矩形，"喂？" 我的语气略带不悦，但并非有意。

"Yo, Shinji, I need you to meet me at my place, we need ta talk about somethin'," Toji, who had a worried sound thrown into his voice, was stammering on the other line… probably something about Hikari again…  
"喂，真嗣，我需要你来我家一趟，我们有事要谈，" 电话那头的东治声音里带着担忧，结结巴巴地说着……可能又是关于光的事……

"Can it wait? I'm kinda busy here."  
"能等会儿吗？我这儿有点忙。"

"Nah, just come here. I promise it won't take long," with a sigh, I take a few moments to consider it. On one hand, he's a friend – sort of – and he needs my help – sort of. On the other, there's a half naked girl five feet away from me who I know for a fact is ready to do something… what that thing is, I'm still not sure, but it's something…  
"算了，过来吧。我保证不会太久，"我叹了口气，花了几分钟考虑。一方面，他是朋友——算是吧——而且他需要我的帮助——也算是吧。另一方面，离我五英尺远有个半裸的女孩，我知道她正准备做些什么……具体是什么，我还不太确定，但肯定是要做点什么……

"Are you SURE it can't wait?"  
"你确定这不能等吗？"

"Just come on!" he hangs up immediately afterwards. With a sigh, I throw on my shirt and grab my pants.  
"快点来吧！"他随即挂了电话。我叹了口气，穿上衬衫，抓起裤子。

"What are you doing? Don't tell me we have to go to NERV!" she props herself up with both elbows and emphasizes the last word with a whine.  
"你在干嘛？别告诉我我们得去 NERV！" 她用双肘撑起身体，最后一词带着抱怨的语气强调道。

"No, I just have to go talk to Toji. Apparently something's wrong, I don't know, but he just won't let up. He said that it won't take long, I'll be right back," she rolls her eyes at me as she lies back down and relaxes her eyelids.  
"不，我只是得去找东治谈谈。好像出了点问题，我也不清楚，但他就是不肯罢休。他说不会花太长时间，我马上就回来，" 她对我翻了个白眼，然后躺回原处，闭上了眼睛。

"Whatever," I look down at my cell phone to see the time was three, and I silently promise myself to be back here by four, four thirty at the very latest.  
"随便吧，" 我低头看了一眼手机，时间是三点，我默默地对自己承诺，最晚四点半一定回到这里。
