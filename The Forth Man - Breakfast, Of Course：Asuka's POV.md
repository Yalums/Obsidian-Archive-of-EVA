[The Forth Man](https://fanfiction.net/u/483603/)
4:30 AM, that's what the clock says.  
凌晨 4:30，时钟上是这么显示的。

Stupid Misato and her stupid drinking problem. How the hell can she get drunken 2 o'clock in the morning, completely forgetting about me and Baka-Shinji, and still call herself our guardian? But that's not even the worst part. The baka and I had to drag Misato's drunken ass back to the apartment. By that time it was already 4 o'clock, which meant that school would start in a few hours. Not a lot of sleep tonight for me.  
愚蠢的葛城和她那愚蠢的酗酒问题。凌晨两点喝得烂醉，彻底忘了我和笨蛋真嗣，还敢自称是我们的监护人？但这还不是最糟的。我和那个笨蛋不得不把烂醉如泥的葛城拖回公寓。那时已经是凌晨四点，意味着再过几小时学校就要上课了。今晚我可没多少时间睡觉了。

The baka hurried off to sleep immediately after we put Misato to bed, he's probably trying to get as much sleep as possible before school starts. I should go back to bed now, but something inside me is telling me to stay here, in Shinji's room.  
那个笨蛋一安顿好葛城就急忙去睡觉了，他大概是想在上学前尽可能多睡一会儿。我也该回去睡觉了，但内心深处有个声音告诉我留在这里，留在真嗣的房间。

Yeah.

I'll just stay here for just a little longer, watching the baka sleep. My invincible Baka-Shinji.  
我就再多待一会儿，看着那个笨蛋睡觉。我无敌的笨蛋真嗣。

-

"Ohayo, Shinji." I say as I walk past him to the bathroom. That's probably the nicest thing I'm going to say all morning.  
"早啊，真嗣。" 我一边说着，一边从他身边走过，进了洗手间。这大概是我整个早上能说的最友善的话了。

I don't know why, but whenever I'm talking to Shinji, or even get near him for that matter, I always feel like I have to mask my affection with insults and violence. It's just that I've always been this way to the baka, and it's hard for me to change. So no matter how hard I try to be nice to Shinji, I always take the easy route and repel him. Sick isn't it? I'm always being a bitch to probably the only one in this world who accepts me for who I really am. I'm pathetic.  
我不知道为什么，但每次和真嗣说话，甚至只是靠近他，我总觉得自己得用侮辱和暴力来掩饰我的感情。我一直对这笨蛋这样，要改变真的很难。所以不管我怎么努力对真嗣好，我总是选择简单的方式推开他。很病态吧？我总是对这世上可能唯一一个接受真实我的人刻薄。我真可悲。

But it'll be different today. I know this sounds silly, but today I'm going to work on being nice to him. After all, change doesn't happen if you just wait for it.  
但今天会不一样。我知道这听起来很傻，但今天我要努力对他好一点。毕竟，改变不会自己发生，你得去争取。

"Ohayo." He replies with a smile. "Want anything, Asuka?" It's beyond me why he has to ask me that every damn morning.  
"早上好。" 他微笑着回答，"想要点什么，明日香？真搞不懂他为什么每天早上都要问我这个。

"Breakfast, of course." I answer like I do every day. I really hope that if Shinji made bacon this morning and that he would trim off the fat the way I requested it, just leaving a tolerable amount in to keep the flavor.  
"当然是早餐了。" 我像往常一样回答。真希望今天早上真嗣做了培根，并且按照我的要求去掉了大部分肥肉，只留下适量的脂肪以保持风味。

"Omelets sound good?" He asks. I really wanted bacon, but I tell myself to just be nice to the baka. He makes good breakfasts, after all.  
"煎蛋卷怎么样？" 他问。我其实很想吃培根，但告诉自己要对这个笨蛋好一点。毕竟，他做的早餐还是挺不错的。

"Sure." I say as I rub my eyes. I definitely did not get enough sleep.  
"当然。" 我揉了揉眼睛。昨晚肯定没睡够。

"Want anything else?" He asks. Why does he always try to please everyone? He's practically always asking if he could do anything to brighten up our lives in any way. What about his own needs and wants? He never seems to request anything for himself. It makes him so… desirable.  
"还要别的吗？" 他问道。为什么他总是试图取悦每个人？他几乎总是在问是否有什么能让我们生活更美好。那他自己的需求和愿望呢？他似乎从不为自己索求什么。这让他显得如此……令人向往。

"Tea." I say. I wonder what he would have done if I shouted out that I wanted him, that he's the only thing I want right now.  
"茶。" 我说。我在想，如果我大声说出我想要他，此刻他是我唯一想要的，他会怎么做。

"Huh?" "嗯？"

"What are you, stupid AND deaf now?" I roar at him. "I said I wanted some tea."  
"你这是又蠢又聋了吗？" 我朝他吼道，"我说了我要喝茶。"

I really don't know why I'm shouting. I'm really trying to stop. Why do I do that? Why do I push away those that I care for most? I would blame it on my sleep deprivation, but I know better. It's just me. I wonder now if I'm ever going to change.  
我真的不知道自己为什么要大喊大叫。我真的很想停下来。我为什么要这么做？为什么我要推开我最在乎的人？我本可以归咎于睡眠不足，但我心里清楚，这就是我。我在想，我是否还能有所改变。

"Here's your tea." He says as he serves me my breakfast. I begin to wonder how long it will take me to change, or if I would ever stop yelling at him or beating him. How long will he put up with me if I don't change? Fear strikes my heart at the thought that Shinji would leave me.  
"这是您的茶。" 他边说边给我端来早餐。我开始思索，要多久我才能改变，或者我是否还会继续对他大吼大叫，甚至动手。如果我不改变，他还能忍受我多久？一想到真嗣可能会离开我，我的心就充满了恐惧。

Please stay with me, Shinji. Just put up with me for a little longer. Please, just do anything, say anything to let me know that you won't leave me.  
请留在我身边，真嗣。再忍受我一会儿就好。求你了，做点什么，说点什么，让我知道你不会离开我。

"No sleep, eh?" He says as he sits down across from me. Not exactly the words I needed, but at least he's talking to me.  
"没睡啊？" 他坐到我对面说。虽然不是我期待的话，但至少他在跟我说话。

"Stupid Misato." I reply, taking a sip of my tea. "What the hell is she thinking, making us wake up in the middle of the night to drag her drunken ass home?" I would do anything to make a conversation between me and Shinji last as long as possible.  
"笨蛋葛城。" 我回了一句，抿了一口茶。"她到底在想什么，大半夜的让我们起来把她那醉醺醺的身子拖回家？" 我愿意做任何事，只为了让与真嗣之间的对话尽可能长久。

"Heh." He chuckles. "Yeah, well when Misato's drunk, you know she doesn't do much thinking." Had I more energy in my sleep deprived body I would have laughed at his comment. "Yesterday was a school night too." He continues.  
"嘿。" 他轻笑一声。"是啊，葛城喝醉的时候，你懂的，她哪还有什么思考能力。" 如果我那因睡眠不足而疲惫的身体还有更多精力，我肯定会为他的话笑出声来。"昨天还是个上学日呢。" 他接着说。

I place the last piece of the omelet in my mouth as I look at the clock. School was going to start soon, and even though I would love to talk to Shinji for a while longer, I was not going to be late to school. Last time I got a tardy on my report card, Misato practically lectured me for about an hour or two. And if that wasn't enough punishment, she also declared the fact that I would have to eat her instant dinners for about a week, something that I'm not sure how I survived.  
我一边将最后一块煎蛋放入口中，一边瞥向时钟。学校很快就要开始上课了，尽管我很想再和真嗣多聊一会儿，但我绝不能迟到。上次我的成绩单上出现了迟到记录，美里几乎为此训斥了我一两个小时。如果这还不够惩罚的话，她还宣布接下来一周我都得吃她的速食晚餐，我真不知道自己是怎么熬过来的。

"Which is why you need to hurry up." I say as I reach for my backpack. Time to put emphasis on the importance of me being on time. "If I'm late one more time because of you, you're really going to regret it, Baka-Shinji." I raise my fist to make my point clear.  
"这就是为什么你要快点。" 我边说边伸手去拿背包。是时候强调我准时的重要性了。"如果我再因为你迟到一次，你真的会后悔的，笨蛋真嗣。" 我举起拳头，让我的意思更明确。

I know, I know. I really am trying to be nicer to him. I'm going to need lots of practice to prepare for tomorrow.  
我知道，我知道。我真的在努力对他好一点。我需要大量练习来为明天做准备。

Because tomorrow is New Years. And I'm going to make it a New Years to remember.  
因为明天是新年。我要让它成为一个难忘的新年。

-

School. Or should I say, the never ending lectures about the second impact, or at least, what NERV wants people the think happened during second impact. Really, I don't understand why I have to listen to all this misinformation. I'm already a college graduate so there's no reason for me being here… save one.  
学校。或者应该说，关于第二次冲击的永无止境的讲座，至少是 NERV 希望人们认为的第二次冲击发生的情况。说真的，我不明白为什么我必须听这些错误信息。我已经是大学毕业生了，所以我没有理由在这里……除了一个。

Shinji. 真嗣。

He's my reason for attending this school. It's just another excuse to spend time with him, not that I really need to be near him twenty-four hours a day. But having a few extra hours around Shinji is nice. I'm not a stalker or anything, who the hell in their right minds would stalk such a wimp? But every once in a while, I sneak glances at him during class time. Maybe it's because he gets so tired in the class or something, but when he sleeps on his desk, he has this dumb look on his face with a bit of drool coming out of his mouth. I find that cute. Right now, it looks like he's trying so hard to keep awake, shifting his head around so he doesn't fall asleep in class.  
他是我来这所学校的原因。这只是另一个和他共度时光的借口，并不是说我真的需要一天二十四小时都待在他身边。但能多几个小时和真嗣在一起也不错。我不是跟踪狂什么的，谁会去跟踪这样一个懦弱的人呢？但偶尔，我会在上课时偷偷看他几眼。也许是因为他在课堂上太累了，或者别的什么，但当他趴在桌子上睡觉时，他那副傻乎乎的样子，嘴角还挂着口水，我觉得很可爱。现在，他似乎正努力保持清醒，不停地转动头部，以免在课堂上睡着。

Damn it, stupid Asuka. He saw me! I'm sure of it, he shifted his head in my direction and he saw me looking at him like some sort of hentai. I quickly turned my attention to another corner of the classroom, making it seem like I'm moving my looking around out of boredom. Good old Fake Coincidence Head-Shift Maneuver.  
该死，愚蠢的明日香。他看到我了！我确信，他转头朝我这边看了，他肯定看到我像看某种色情片一样盯着他。我迅速将视线转向教室的另一个角落，装作是因为无聊而四处张望。经典的假巧合转头策略。

It always works. Baka-Shinji never caught on that I was looking over at him on purpose. He's probably just looking around the classroom because he's bored like I was pretending to do.  
这招总是奏效。笨蛋真嗣从未察觉我是故意看向他的。他可能只是像我假装的那样，因为无聊而环顾教室。

But just for a while, I really had hoped he was looking at me. That he was just as infatuated with me as I am with him. But that's never going to happen if I don't start changing my ways. He'll never like me the way I am; always being mean to just about the nicest guy I've ever met. So I begin to work on being nice to him. I'll talk to him, that's a sign of friendship isn't it?  
但有那么一会儿，我真的希望他在看我。希望他和我一样，对我着迷。但如果我不开始改变自己的行为，这永远不会发生。他永远不会喜欢现在的我；总是对有史以来我遇到的最好的人刻薄。所以我开始尝试对他好一点。我会和他交谈，这是友谊的标志，不是吗？

"You bored?" I type. I knew that he was, but I'd do anything to start a conversation with him. I wonder if he even knows its me who's typing to him, so I make sure that he knows. "Well? Reply already, Baka-Shinji." That should definitely tell him that it was me who sent the message. Well… that and I'm getting impatient and I need someone to talk to right now.  
"你无聊吗？" 我打字问道。我知道他肯定无聊，但我愿意做任何事来和他开始对话。我在想他是否知道是我正在和他聊天，所以我确保他知道是我。"喂，快回话啊，笨蛋真嗣。" 这肯定能让他知道是我发的消息。嗯……还有就是我现在有点不耐烦，急需找人聊天。

"I'm surprised that you're not asleep yet." He types. Heh. He's one to talk. I've seen him last for only three minutes of the teacher's lecture and then he was out like log. One time, he even slept in class throughout the entire day, skipping lunch even.  
"我惊讶你还没睡。" 他打字说。呵呵，他倒是有资格这么说。我见过他听老师讲课只坚持了三分钟就睡得像根木头。有一次，他甚至在课堂上睡了一整天，连午饭都没吃。

Not that I… always check up on him, but it gives me something to do during class.  
并不是说我……总是关注他，但这让我在课堂上有点事做。

Anyways, back to the conversation. It takes me a few seconds to come up with a response to his comment. "I might as well be. I'm not learning anything anyways." I type. "But if I go to sleep, then I become vulnerable to you or your hentai stooges staring at my glorious body without the fear of me beating the crap out of you guys." I know that Shinji isn't a peeping hentai, but I just say that he is. It's okay to constantly call him a hentai, I'm not being mean, it's just a friendly comment. Right?  
总之，回到对话上来。我花了好几秒才对他的评论作出回应：“我或许真是这样，反正也学不到什么。”我打字道。“但如果我去睡觉，那就会在你或你的变态跟班们面前变得毫无防备，任由你们肆无忌惮地窥视我这光辉夺目的身体，而我却无法痛扁你们一顿。”我知道真嗣并非偷窥狂，但我就是故意这么说。不停地叫他变态也没关系，我并非恶意，这只是友好的调侃，对吧？

"I'm not a hentai." He defends himself. I know he's not. "And who in their right mind would risk getting beaten to death by you anyways?" That hurt. Does it ever occur to him that I want people to be attracted to me, especially himself?  
"我不是变态。" 他为自己辩解。我知道他不是。"而且谁会脑子正常到冒着被你打死的风险呢？" 这话刺痛了我。他有没有想过，我希望别人被我吸引，尤其是他？

But I'd never show any signs of weakness. "I do instill fear don't I? :-) " Do I scare Shinji? Is he so afraid of me that he can't see that I just want to be close to him?  
但我绝不会显露半点软弱。“我确实让人畏惧，不是吗？:-)”我是否吓到了真嗣？他是否因过于害怕而看不出我只是想亲近他？

"Heh. To Kensuke maybe." He answers. "Toji, however, only obeys Hikari." I'm surprised that Shinji knew how the stooge and the class rep felt about each other. I was pretty sure that he, being one of the stooges, would be so dense as to not noticing the obvious and inevitable relationship that Toji and Hikari share with each other.  
"呵呵，对健介来说可能是这样。" 他回答道，"但东治只听光里的。" 我惊讶于真嗣竟然知道那个跟班和班长之间的感情。我本以为，作为他们中的一员，他会迟钝到察觉不到东治和光里之间显而易见且必然的关系。

"They have it in for each other so badly and they don't see it." I say. "It's kind of sad, isn't it?"  
"他们彼此之间针锋相对，却浑然不觉。" 我说，"这有点可悲，不是吗？"

"One of them should make the first move." He replies. "I bet that's exactly what both of them are hoping and waiting for the other to do. I just don't see the point in not making a move, there's no harm in doing so." His words burn in my heart as I realize that all I have been doing was exactly what he said, hoping and waiting.  
"他们中总得有人先迈出那一步。" 他回应道，"我敢打赌，这正是他们双方都在期待对方去做的事。我只是不明白，为什么不去主动出击，这样做又不会有什么损失。" 他的话在我心中燃烧，我意识到自己一直以来所做的，正是他所说的，只是期待和等待。

Should I follow his advice? Should I make my move? What if he rejects me? Rejection, it's what I've been fearing all along isn't it? After all, would Shinji even like a person who slaps him around all the time? I'll know by tomorrow.  
我应该听从他的建议吗？我应该采取行动吗？如果他拒绝我怎么办？拒绝，这不一直是我所害怕的吗？毕竟，真嗣会喜欢一个总是对他动手的人吗？明天我就会知道了。

My thoughts are interrupted by another message on my laptop, one not coming from Shinji. "I completely agree." The message said. "I thought you two might have been talking to each other. You should take your own advice, Shinji." Who the hell was this? And what did he mean that Shinji should take his own advice?  
我的思绪被笔记本电脑上另一条消息打断了，这条消息并非来自真嗣。"我完全同意。"消息说。"我以为你们俩可能在互相交谈。你应该听从自己的建议，真嗣。"这他妈是谁？他说的真嗣应该听从自己的建议是什么意思？

Shinji answers my first question with his guess. "Kensuke?"  
真嗣回答了我的第一个问题，他猜测道：“是健介吗？”

Damn that perverted otaku. He's going to pay for interrupting a private conversation between me and Shinji. "Baka!" I type. "How dare you enter our conversation, you stooge!"  
该死的变态宅男，他竟敢打断我和真嗣的私人对话，一定要让他付出代价。“笨蛋！”我打字回复，“你竟敢闯入我们的对话，你这个傀儡！”

"He's not the only one!" Another hacker? Don't tell me it's Toji! Now I'll never continue my chat with Shinji. "So what have you two newlyweds been plotting eh?" If I wasn't so angry I would have blushed at the newlyweds statement. Now that I think about it, Shinji and I actually do act like newlyweds, not that I'll ever admit it.  
"他可不是唯一一个！" 又来一个黑客？别告诉我是冬二！这下我和真嗣的聊天是没法继续了。"那么你们这对新婚夫妇最近在密谋什么呢？" 要不是气得不行，我肯定要因为"新婚夫妇"这个词脸红。现在想想，我和真嗣的互动确实挺像新婚夫妇的，不过我可永远不会承认。

"Do you two stooges really want to risk getting your asses beaten today?" I threaten.  
你们两个傻瓜真的想今天冒着被痛扁的风险吗？我威胁道。

"Damn, demon. It's bad enough you fantasize about spanking Shinji's ass, but now you gotta fantasize about ours too?" They replied. Damn I'm disappointed at myself for walking straight into that one. My infatuation with Shinji has been distracting me lately.  
该死，恶魔。你幻想打真嗣的屁股还不够，现在连我们的也要幻想了吗？他们回应道。真该死，我对自己就这样直截了当地陷入其中感到失望。最近我对真嗣的迷恋一直在分散我的注意力。

Stupid stooges, Shinji better have not read that. Time to get brutal with the two jackasses. "You two better enjoy your last hours of manhood, because after class is over I'm going to jam my shoe so far in your crotch that you'll be tasting urine in your mouth whenever you pee."  
愚蠢的跟班们，真嗣最好没看到那东西。是时候对这两个蠢货下狠手了。“你们俩最好享受最后的男子气概时光，因为下课后我会把我的鞋深深地塞进你们的裤裆，让你们每次小便时都能尝到嘴里的尿味。”

That ought to shut them up. I take a glance at Shinji. My heart sinks as I realize that he had already shut his laptop down and would not be conversing with me anymore. Damn, those two assholes are really going to get it after class. They're lucky they don't see me everyday or they'd see how much of a bitch I can really be.  
这下应该能让他们闭嘴了。我瞥了一眼真嗣，心一沉，意识到他已经合上了笔记本电脑，不会再和我交谈了。该死，那两个混蛋放学后有他们好看的。算他们走运，不是每天都能见到我，否则他们会见识到我真正的厉害。

-

That was embarrassing. 那真是尴尬。

Have you ever tried pretending to act like your usual self to cover a hidden motive? It's harder than you think. I had just spent the last hour or two pretending to beg Misato to let me go to Kaji's New Years party. I actually don't want to go. Why would I want to spend my entire night watching Kaji and Misato make out? It's just disgusting. But just to make sure no one gets suspicious of me, I had to ask Misato if I could go anyways, even when I knew her answer was going to be "no".  
你试过假装表现得和平时一样，来掩盖一个隐藏的动机吗？这比你想的要难。我刚花了上一两个小时，假装恳求美里让我去参加加持的新年派对。其实我根本不想去。我为什么要整晚看着加持和美里亲热？那太恶心了。但为了确保没人对我起疑，我还是得问美里我能不能去，尽管我知道她的回答肯定是‘不行’。

But that's not all the acting that I'm going to have to do tonight. Earlier, I convinced Misato to get a bottle of sake for me. I knew she would happily get one for me and Shinji so she could have the opportunity to get Shinji to drink. Tonight, it'll be just Shinji and me and the bottle of sake. Hopefully, by the end of tonight, I'll know for sure.  
但这还不是今晚我要做的全部表演。早些时候，我说服美里给我买了一瓶清酒。我知道她会很乐意为我和真嗣买一瓶，这样她就有机会让真嗣喝酒了。今晚，将只有我和真嗣，还有那瓶清酒。希望到了今晚结束时，我能确切地知道答案。

An hour passed ever since Misato had left the building, and so far, nothing. I was on my tenth cup of sake and Shinji hasn't even touched his. He just stared at his cup with that cute dumbfounded face that he always has on. I don't think he even notices that I'm slowly inching closer to him. I think it's time to get his attention.  
自美里离开大楼已过去一个小时，至今仍无动静。我已喝到第十杯清酒，而真嗣却连碰都没碰他的那杯。他只是盯着杯子，脸上挂着那副一贯的可爱呆滞表情。我怀疑他甚至没注意到我正悄悄向他靠近。是时候吸引他的注意了。

"Shinji…" I whisper in my best drunken voice. "I want more sake!"  
"真嗣…" 我用最醉意的声音低语，"我还要清酒！"

"What?" He asks, a bit startled by the broken silence.  
"什么？" 他问道，被这打破的寂静稍稍惊了一下。

"More! More! More!" I try my hardest to make myself sound like a little girl who had just raided a candy shop. "Sake! Sake! Sake!"  
"还要！还要！还要！" 我尽力让自己听起来像一个刚洗劫了糖果店的小女孩。"清酒！清酒！清酒！"

"You're drunk." He nervously replies. He may be right.  
"你醉了。" 他紧张地回答。他可能是对的。

"No, I'm not." I fake some excessive giggles, the sake is making it easier. "You're the one that's drunk."  
"不，我没醉。" 我假装夸张地咯咯笑，清酒让这一切变得更容易。"是你醉了。"

He pauses for a while, not knowing how to reply to my wasted nature. I can see it in his eyes that his poor mind has no idea what to do. I wonder how he would react if I started brushing up on him. I think I'll find out soon.  
他停顿了一会儿，不知道该如何回应我的醉态。从他的眼神中我能看出，他那可怜的头脑完全不知道该怎么办。我想知道如果我开始挑逗他，他会如何反应。我想我很快就会知道了。

"Asuka." He says as he lowers himself to squatting position.  
"明日香。" 他边说边蹲下身来。

"Yes?" I ask. It's hard to constantly force giggles out of my mouth.  
"怎么了？" 我问道。要不停地从嘴里挤出笑声真是难。

"I…" He starts to stutter. "I-I… uhh… that is… I…"  
"我…" 他开始结巴起来。"我-我…呃…那…那…我…"

What's he trying to say? "What?" I ask as I lean towards his face, hoping to pressure his words out of him.  
他想说什么？"什么？" 我一边问，一边朝他的脸凑近，希望能逼出他的话来。

"I-I-I…" Come on, just say what you want! Let me know how you feel! Suddenly, he grabs the sake bottle away from my cup and turns around. "I really think you should stop drinking!"  
"我...我...我..." 拜托，直接说出你的想法吧！让我知道你的感受！突然，他一把夺走了我杯子旁的清酒瓶，转身说道："我真的觉得你应该停止喝酒了！"

"Hmph." I scoff as I feel my heart on the verge of shattering. The only thing keeping my hope alive is the fact that the night was not over yet. "You're no fun at all." I say.  
"哼。" 我嗤之以鼻，感到心即将碎裂。唯一支撑着我希望的是，夜晚尚未结束。"你真是一点都不好玩。" 我说道。

I guess it was about here that I decided to teach him the meaning of "fun". I start to crawl towards him, still feigning a bit of drunkenness. His body starts to move away from mine, but I still gain on him. He must have stumbled on something because I suddenly find myself directly on top of his body, pinning him down. I begin to ask myself if it just the sake doing this, or if it was really me.  
我想大概就是在这儿，我决定教他理解“乐趣”的含义。我开始向他爬去，依旧装作有些醉意。他的身体开始远离我，但我仍逐渐逼近。他一定是被什么东西绊了一下，因为我突然发现自己直接压在了他身上，将他牢牢按住。我开始自问，这究竟是清酒的作用，还是我真的如此。

I decide to take control so I can accomplish what I planned for tonight. "Do you care about me, Shinji?" I ask. I see his startled reaction. "Do you like me?"  
我决定掌控局面，以便完成今晚的计划。“你关心我吗，真嗣？”我问道。我看到了他惊讶的反应。“你喜欢我吗？”

My heart leaps as he nods. But I still need confirmation. I need to be 100% sure.  
他一点头，我的心便雀跃起来。但我仍需确认，我需要百分之百的确定。

"Say it." I demand. "Tell me in words."  
"说出来。" 我要求道。"用言语告诉我。"

"I like you Asuka, more than you can imagine. I've always cared about you; I liked you ever since we first met. That's the truth."  
"我喜欢你，明日香，超乎你的想象。我一直以来都在乎你；从我们第一次见面起，我就喜欢上你了。这是真的。"

I can't believe it. After all the abuse, after all the beating and ordering around, not only is he putting up with me but he actually likes me. I can feel my heart swelling with joy. But I force myself to keep composed until I can accomplish my final goal for tonight. Still, a smile escapes my face.  
我简直不敢相信。经历了所有的虐待，所有的殴打和命令，他不仅忍受了我，而且真的喜欢我。我能感觉到我的心脏因喜悦而膨胀。但我强迫自己保持镇定，直到今晚我能完成我的最终目标。尽管如此，一丝微笑还是从我的脸上逃了出来。

"I like you too." I admit. Damn I forgot that I'm supposed to be drunk right now. "I mean, I really, REALLY, like you."  
"我也喜欢你。" 我承认道。该死，我忘了我现在应该装醉。"我是说，我真的很，真的很喜欢你。"

The baka never notices the flaw in my act. "You really do?" he asks.  
这个笨蛋从来看不出我表演的破绽。"你真的吗？" 他问道。

"Yes, I do." I say. Time to be more aggressive, as in drunkenly aggressive. "You're mine, okay? You'll always be my Baka-Shinji forevers and evers and evers. You'd never leave me would you?" This is the it. The final moment that can change my life forever. It all depends on what Shinji says.  
"是的，我愿意。" 我说道。是时候更主动一些了，就像醉酒时那样主动。"你是我的，明白吗？你永远是我的笨蛋真嗣，永远永远永远。你不会离开我的，对吧？" 这就是关键时刻，能永远改变我生活的最终时刻。一切都取决于真嗣的回答。

And somewhere in my heart, I already know his answer. I think that I've always known the answer.  
而在我内心的某个角落，我已经知道他的答案了。我想我一直以来都知道这个答案。

"Of course not." He says. I can't control my expression anymore. A full blown smile appears on my teary face. "I'll never leave you." He continues. "I'll stay with you forever."  
"当然不会。"他说。我再也无法控制自己的表情，泪水未干的脸庞上绽放出灿烂的笑容。"我永远不会离开你。"他继续说道，"我会永远陪在你身边。"

"Promise me." I demand. I'm sure he will.  
"答应我。" 我要求道。我相信他会答应的。

"I promise that I'll never leave you." He says, just like I knew he would. "No matter what happens, I'll always be by your side."  
"我承诺，我永远不会离开你。" 他说道，正如我所预料的那样。"无论发生什么，我都会一直陪在你身边。"

"Then kiss me." I whisper as I inch my face closer to his.  
"那么，吻我吧。" 我轻声说着，缓缓将脸靠近他。

He doesn't move. I should have known that Shinji would be too frozen to do such an act. My patience wears out as I press my lips onto his, something that I have been waiting all night to do. His lips are soft, and they grow softer as he kisses me back. At this moment I knew that I would not be separated from my Baka-Shinji for as long as I live.  
他没有动。我早该知道，真嗣会因为过于僵硬而无法做出这样的举动。随着我将自己的唇贴上他的，这一整晚我都在等待的时刻终于到来，我的耐心也逐渐耗尽。他的唇柔软，随着他回应我的吻，变得更加柔软。在这一刻，我明白，只要我活着，就绝不会与我的笨蛋真嗣分离。

I feel warm now, being with him. So warm… like I'm drifting off to sleep… with my Shinji-kun…  
和他在一起，我现在感到很温暖。如此温暖……就像要沉入梦乡……和我的真嗣君一起……

Before I fell asleep, I make a wish to let this moment last as long as possible. Because I know that tomorrow morning, I'm going to have to wake up from this dream. I'm sorry Shinji, for the selfish thing that I have to do tomorrow. I'm sorry that by tomorrow morning, this will only exist as a memory. I wish that this moment would last forever.  
在我入睡之前，我许了一个愿，希望这一刻能尽可能长久。因为我知道，明天早上，我将不得不从这场梦中醒来。真嗣，对不起，明天我必须做一件自私的事。对不起，到了明天早上，这一切只会成为回忆。我希望这一刻能永远持续下去。

But moments pass, it's what they do.  
但时光总会流逝，这是它们的本质。

My head feels painful. Not like "ow, I didn't get good sleep so my head hurts" pain, but more like "shit, I just got hit by a car" pain. It takes me awhile to realize that I've been sleeping in the living room all night. I nearly trip over an empty sake bottle that lay right in front of me. Is that my sake bottle? Damn, I really must've gotten wasted on New Years.  
我的头感觉很痛。不是那种'哎呀，我没睡好所以头有点痛'的痛，而是更像是'该死，我刚被车撞了'的那种痛。我花了一会儿才意识到自己整晚都在客厅里睡觉。我差点被面前的一个空清酒瓶绊倒。那是我的清酒瓶吗？该死，新年那天我肯定喝得烂醉如泥。

As I take a seat on the couch, I hear someone walk into the living room. It's Baka-Shinji. I really hope I didn't do anything stupid in front of him last night. I probably did do something extremely stupid because the baka has the widest grin that I've ever seen on him right now. Damn my head hurts.  
当我坐在沙发上时，我听到有人走进客厅。是笨蛋真嗣。我真希望昨晚没在他面前做出什么蠢事。我可能真的做了什么极其愚蠢的事，因为这家伙现在脸上挂着我见过的最夸张的笑容。该死，我的头好痛。

"Ohayo." He says. I start clutching my head tighter, trying to keep the sooth the pain to a bearable amount.  
"早上好。" 他说道。我开始更紧地抱住头，试图将疼痛缓解到可以忍受的程度。

"Ohayo." I reply. I couldn't think of anything else to say due to the massive headache.  
"早上好。" 我回答。由于剧烈的头痛，我实在想不出其他话来。

"Are you feeling okay?" He asks. Sometimes the baka can be so blind.  
"你还好吗？"他问道。有时候这笨蛋真是瞎得可以。

"Does it look like I'm okay, Baka-Shinji?" I lash at him. "I got a headache so big it feels like I'm turning into a stooge!" No, that is not an exaggeration. I really feel like I'm growing dumber.  
“你看我像是没事的样子吗，笨蛋真嗣？”我冲他吼道，“我头疼得厉害，感觉自己都要变成小丑了！”不，这绝不是夸张，我真的觉得自己越来越蠢了。

"Well, you did drink nearly a full bottle of Misato's sake last night. You're probably getting a hangover." He says.  
"嗯，你昨晚几乎喝光了葛城小姐的一整瓶清酒。你现在估计是宿醉了。" 他说道。

"Is that what I did last night?" I ask. Damn, this is frustrating.  
"我昨晚真的那么做了吗？" 我问道。该死，这真让人沮丧。

"Of course you did." He confirms. "The bottle didn't just empty itself."  
"当然是你喝的。" 他确认道，"瓶子总不会自己空掉吧。"

I can't believe I drank all of that sake. I don't think I'll ever touch alcohol again. Baka-Shinji probably took advantage of my drunkenness and did something hentai with vulnerable me. I bet he was climbing all over my body and groping my…  
真不敢相信我把那些清酒全喝光了。我想我再也不会碰酒精了。笨蛋慎二肯定趁我醉得不省人事，对我这脆弱的人做了些变态的事。我敢打赌他肯定在我身上到处乱爬，还摸我的……

No…

I remember now. I was on top of him, staring into his eyes. And I told him everything. It was part of the plan, it was what I've been planning for the past few days. I remember I was acting drunk, and I admitted that I really liked him. And that was right after… oh mein gott…  
我现在记起来了。我正压在他身上，凝视着他的双眼。我向他倾诉了一切。这是计划的一部分，是我过去几天一直在筹划的。我记得我装作醉了，坦白说我真的很喜欢他。而那正是在……哦，我的天啊……之后。

He told me he liked me too. He likes me! He promised that he'd never leave me. He promised that we would stay together forever.  
他告诉我他也喜欢我。他喜欢我！他承诺永远不会离开我。他承诺我们会永远在一起。

I feel like I'm about to burst with joy. If my head didn't hurt so much, I'd probably leap on Shinji right now and give him a Misato-sized hug. Then I remember the second part of the plan. I told myself that this was not to go any further. Trust me, going further is what I want most. To tell you the truth, I would love to be Shinji's girlfriend, and maybe something even more. I know that I would care for him as long as I live.  
我感觉自己快要被喜悦撑爆了。如果不是头痛得厉害，我现在可能已经跳到真嗣身上，给他一个美里式的大拥抱了。然后我想起了计划的第二部分。我告诫自己，不能再进一步了。相信我，再进一步正是我最渴望的。说实话，我多希望能成为真嗣的女朋友，甚至可能更进一步。我知道，只要我活着，就会一直关心他。

But what if he felt different? What if somewhere along the way, he decides that I'm not enough for him? Or what if I go too far with my insults and beatings? Everything I have ever loved has been taken away from me, and if I ever lose Shinji, I wouldn't be able to stand it. So I can't allow myself to love him. I can't allow myself to love anyone.  
但如果他的感受变了怎么办？如果在某个时刻，他认定我已无法满足他怎么办？又或者，如果我的侮辱和殴打太过分了怎么办？我所珍爱的一切都已被夺走，如果我失去了真嗣，我将无法承受。所以我不能允许自己去爱他。我不能允许自己去爱任何人。

"I don't remember." I finally say. "I don't remember anything that happened last night." I'm so sorry, my sweet Shinji. Please forgive me.  
“我不记得了。”我终于说道，“我不记得昨晚发生的任何事情。”真的很抱歉，我亲爱的真嗣。请原谅我。

I can see his heart shatter. I see tears forming into his eyes. I fight to hold back my own; fighting back my tears seems harder than ever now.  
我能看见他的心碎裂。泪水在他眼中凝聚。我努力抑制自己的泪水；此刻，忍住泪水似乎比以往任何时候都要艰难。

But I manage to keep myself together as I act as casual as I could. "I didn't do anything stupid, did I?" I ask, trying to get a response out of him. "Nothing happened, right?"  
但我还是设法保持镇定，尽可能表现得漫不经心。“我没做什么蠢事吧？”我问道，试图从他那里得到回应。“什么都没发生，对吧？”

It takes him a while, but he finally gives me a reply. "No, Asuka. Nothing happened." He lied, wiping his tears away and forcing a small smile on his face. Thank you, Shinji. I smile back at him. I'm glad that he didn't pressure me into going any further.  
他过了好一会儿才回答我。“不，明日香，什么都没发生。”他撒了谎，擦去泪水，脸上强挤出一丝微笑。谢谢你，真嗣。我对他回以微笑。我很高兴他没有逼我走得更远。

"Good." I say. I put on my best normal Asuka expression. "For your sake I hope nothing hentai happened yesterday. If I find out you did something hentai to me, you're going to fear even being in the same room as me."  
“好。”我说着，摆出了最平常的明日香表情。“为了你好，我希望昨天没发生什么变态的事。如果我发现你对我做了什么变态的事，你会连和我同处一室都感到害怕。”

He nods, his smile is bright now as everything returns to normal, just as it should be. I think that deep inside Shinji, a serious relationship would sound scary to him too. And we already share a relationship with each other, a different special kind of relationship. A type of relationship that allows us to be close to each other, but not enough to hurt each other. This type of relationship that we share would do for me.  
他点头，笑容此刻明媚，一切恢复如常，正如应有的样子。我想，在真嗣内心深处，一段认真的关系对他来说也可能是可怕的。而我们已经彼此拥有一种关系，一种特别的、不同寻常的关系。这种关系让我们能够彼此亲近，但又不足以伤害对方。我们共享的这种关系，对我来说已经足够了。

"Breakfast is almost ready. Want anything, Asuka?" He asks as he retreats to the kitchen. His daily normal question.  
"“早餐快准备好了。有什么想吃的吗，明日香？”他边问边退回厨房。这是他每日的例行提问。”

"Breakfast, of course." I say my routine reply. I hope he brings some ice for me while he's at it. This is the relationship that we are comfortable with, it's truly unbreakable. And maybe, when I feel like I'm ready, we may blossom into something more. Until then, I'm content with what I have now. Because I know that he promised me that he'll never leave me.  
"当然是早餐。" 我照例回答。希望他顺便给我带点冰块。这就是我们自在的关系，真正牢不可破。或许，当我感觉准备好了，我们可能会绽放成更美好的模样。在那之前，我满足于现状。因为我知道，他承诺过永远不会离开我。

You'll stay with me forever won't you, Shinji? You promised.  
你会永远和我在一起的，对吧，真嗣？你承诺过的。

THE END 终章

==========

Backstage Bonus: Life's Not Fair  
幕后花絮：生活不公平

Shinji: I can't believe that Asuka's POV is longer than mine. I'm the main character of Evangelion, right? Shouldn't all fanfictions revolve around me?  
真嗣：我真不敢相信明日香的视角比我的还长。我才是《新世纪福音战士》的主角，对吧？所有的同人小说不都应该围绕我展开吗？

Toji: Actually, if you check online, you're not nearly as popular as Asuka or Rei.  
冬二：其实，你要是上网查查，你会发现你远没有明日香或绫波丽那么受欢迎。

Shinji: What? 真嗣：什么？

Toji (Opening Netscape 7.1 on his laptop): See here? Both Asuka and Rei have at least dozens of shrines dedicated just to them. You've got… maybe six.  
東治（在他的笔记本上打开 Netscape 7.1）：看这里？明日香和绫波至少都有几十个专门为他们设立的神社。而你呢……可能只有六个。

Shinji (Grabbing the laptop): That can't be right, I've got more than six! Let me see!  
真嗣（抓住笔记本）：这不可能是对的，我肯定不止六个！让我看看！

Shinji searches all throughout Google for shrines dedicated just to him, only to have found five, two of which whose links don't even work.  
真嗣在谷歌上四处搜寻专门供奉他的神社，结果只找到五座，其中两座的链接还无法访问。

Shinji: What about this one? "For the Love of Shinji Ikari: An official Shinji Ikari fanlisting". It's got sixty members. See? I'm a pretty popular guy.  
真嗣：这个怎么样？“真嗣·伊卡里之爱：官方真嗣·伊卡里粉丝联盟”。有六十名成员。看到了吗？我挺受欢迎的。

Toji (chuckling): Uhh… this site says you're a pervert. Oh, and you're also gay.  
东治（轻笑）：呃……这个网站说你是个变态。哦，还有，你还是个同性恋。

Shinji: I'm not gay! 真嗣：我不是同性恋！

Toji: The sixty members here say otherwise.  
冬二：这里的六十名成员可不这么认为。

Shinji (groaning): At least most of the authors on write pretty neat stuff about me.  
真嗣（呻吟）：至少大多数作者写关于我的东西还是挺不错的。

Toji: There are quite a few stories here that pair you up with Kaworu.  
冬二：这里有不少故事都是把你和薰配对的。

Shinji (glowing bright red): I'm not attracted to Kaworu.  
真嗣（满脸通红）：我对薰没有那种感觉。

Toji (laughing): Suuure… and remember that Asuka has a longer POV than you do in this fanfiction.  
冬二（笑着）：当然啦……别忘了在这篇同人小说里，明日香的视角比你长多了。

Shinji: Shut up! Life's not fair for me, okay? I'm going to talk to the author about that.  
真嗣：闭嘴！我的生活本来就不公平，行了吧？我要去找作者谈谈这事。

Toji: You can't right now. Asuka and Rei are still taking turns kicking him in the unmentionables. He's going to have to change his name to The Fourth Woman if this keeps up.  
冬二：你现在不行。明日香和绫波还在轮流踢他的要害部位。如果这种情况持续下去，他恐怕得改名叫“第四位女性”了。

Shinji (sighing and leaving for the door): Fine… I'll talk to him when they're done. Let's get out of here.  
真嗣（叹息着走向门口）：好吧……等他们谈完了我再跟他谈。我们离开这儿吧。

TheForthMan (distantly crying): WHY HASN'T ANYONE CALLED 9-1-1?  
TheForthMan（远处哭喊）：为什么还没人拨打 9-1-1？
