**NERV**
Pilots´ Locker Room 飞行员休息室  
After Synch Tests 完成同步测试后**_

After the synch tests for all the Evangelion Units at NERV Japan, the female pilots had gone to the showers immediately, to shower away the lingering LCL from their hair and bodies. Rei Ayanami was the first to get out of the showers, her short hair was easy to clean, while both her colleagues had longer hair, especially Soryu, and therefore took longer in the shower. The second to get out was Mari Illustious Makinami, the new pilot, assigned to Unit-05. Interestingly, the eccentric girl took little time to wash off the LCL; apparently, she actually liked its smell.  
在 NERV 日本完成所有福音战士单位的同步测试后，女性驾驶员们随即前往淋浴，以洗去头发和身体上残留的 LCL。绫波丽率先走出淋浴间，她的短发容易清洗，而她的同事们，尤其是长发飘飘的惣流，则需要更长时间。紧随其后的是新驾驶员真希波·真理·伊拉丝多莉亚斯，她被分配到 Unit-05。令人意外的是，这位性格古怪的女孩清洗 LCL 的速度很快，似乎她对 LCL 的气味颇为喜爱。

Finally, Asuka got back into the dressing room, her brow furrowed in annoyance, still toweling her hair vigorously, Mari had finished dressing, and was pulling up her black boots while humming a contagious beat. She was usually very fast, but this particular day, she was in a hurry.  
最后，明日香回到更衣室，眉头因不悦而紧皱，她正用力地用毛巾擦干头发。此时，玛丽已穿戴整齐，一边哼着让人忍不住跟着摇摆的旋律，一边拉上她的黑色长靴。她平日里动作迅速，但今天显然更为急切。

"Hoy para mí es un día especial, ¡Hoy saldré por la noche! Pam, para, ¡pam! *" Mari Ilustrious Makinami sang happily, and, with a cute hip movement, closed the door of her locker.  
"今天对我而言意义非凡，今晚我将外出！砰，停，砰！" 玛丽·伊利斯托里乌斯·明日香欢快地唱着，随着俏皮的臀部动作，她关上了储物柜的门。

"Bye, girls! I have a date!" she waved them goodbye, picked up her sports bag, and left the room. As she crossed the threshold, Asuka and Rei heard her almost ultrasonic happy squeak, "This is so exciting!"  
再见啦，姑娘们！我有个约会！" 她向她们挥手道别，拎起运动包，便离开了房间。刚一跨出门槛，明日香和绫波丽就听到她那近乎超声波般兴奋的尖叫声，"真是太激动人心了！

Asuka huffed, annoyed by Mari´s happy humor; but held her tongue. At least until the other pilot was well away. Raising her arms, she exclaimed, "Arrgh! I can´t stand her!" Followed by a very inventive stream of german expelitives, that her colleague didn´t bother to follow. Although she might have learned a few new words had she paid attention.  
明日香气得直呼气，对真希波的欢快情绪感到不耐烦；但她忍住了没吭声。直到另一位飞行员走远后，她举起双臂，大声抱怨：“啊！我真是受不了她！”随后是一串极具创意的德语咒骂，她的同事对此并不在意。不过，如果她留心听的话，或许能学到几个新词。

"And to top it off, she´s going out with Baka Shinji!"  
更让人无语的是，她居然和傻瓜真嗣在一起！

Rei looked sideways at her, while she changed into her usual school uniform. By the time Rei had put her shoes on, Asuka had displaced the target of her fury, squarely onto Shinji. Rei stood up, and calmly walked towards the volatile redhead.  
丽侧目观察着她换上平日的校服。待丽穿好鞋时，明日香已将怒气完全转向了真嗣。丽站起身，沉着地向那位情绪不稳的红发少女走去。

Just when Asuka was really inspired to get into the second phase of her rant, Rei turned her around brusquely, grabbed Asuka´s blouse with both hands, lifted her with deceiving ease and slammed her against the lockers.  
正当明日香情绪高涨，准备展开她那番长篇大论的第二阶段时，绫波突然粗暴地将她转过身，双手紧抓明日香的衬衫，轻而易举地将她提起，并狠狠地摔向储物柜。

"Was?" she blurted, completely taken by surprise. Her feet found no purchase, and the grill on the locker door was digging into her back, painfully.  
"什么？"她惊呼出声，完全措手不及。脚下无处着力，储物柜门上的格栅正顶着她的背，疼痛难忍。

"Do I have your full attention, Soryu?" Rei asked tersely, tilting her head to a side, like she was studying Asuka. "Very well. It is enough. This whole situation is… unacceptable."  
我是否完全吸引了你的注意力，Soryu？" 绫波丽直截了当地问，侧头打量着明日香。"很好。这样就够了。整个局面……实在令人难以接受。

"Uh? What in the seven hells are you talking about, Wonder Girl?"  
啊？你在说什么莫名其妙的话，神奇女孩？

"Your attitude towards Shinji. It is _unacceptable_." Rei repeated, while the German redhead looked at her, amazed that the usually placid and indifferent First Child had her literally, hanging. Asuka took breath, and exploded into a new rant. "Shinji is an idiot who doesn´t know what´s good for him!"  
你对真嗣的态度，这实在让人无法接受。" 绫波再次强调，那位德国红发少女惊讶地注视着她，平日里总是波澜不惊、漠不关心的第一适格者，此刻却显得格外在意。明日香深吸一口气，紧接着又是一阵怒气冲冲的斥责："真嗣就是个傻瓜，根本不懂什么对他有益！

Without any change in her features, Rei pulled Asuka a couple of inches away from the locker, and swiftly, put her back against it. The sudden movement put Asuka´s head in painful contact with the metal. Rei continued, while Asuka rubbed the point of impact. "True in part. Shinji is not an idiot, but he really doesn´t know better. Probably because _he doesn´t realize_ you have been flirting with him."  
绫波面无表情，轻轻将明日香从储物柜拉开几英寸，迅速让她背靠在柜子上。这一突然的动作让明日香的头猛地撞上了金属，她疼得揉着撞击处。绫波继续说道：“这话只说对了一半。真嗣并不傻，只是他真的不懂。或许是因为他没察觉到你一直在对他示好。”

Asuka was so dumbfounded she stopped struggling. "W-what?"  
明日香震惊得停止了挣扎，结巴地问道："什...什么？"

"Since your arrival to Tokyo-3, I have studied your behavior. And not only yours, also Shinji´s, and Mari´s; in fact, everybody in this school has been a source of data. My observations lead me to conclude that Makinami doesn´t pay as much attention to Shinji as he does towards her. Or like you to him, or _him to you_. At least, not when you three don´t know you are being watched."  
自从你抵达东京-3 以来，我便开始研究你的行为模式。这不仅限于你，还包括真嗣和玛丽；实际上，这所学校中的每个人都成了我的观察对象。通过观察，我发现玛金尼对真嗣的关注远不及真嗣对她的关注，也不及你对他的关注，或是他对你的关注。至少，在你们三人未察觉被观察时是如此。

"What are you talking about, Wonder Girl?"  
你在说什么呢，神奇女孩？

"Shinji has little experience in social interactions. If he pays attention to Makinami is because she pays attention to him, in a non confrontational way. But, based on his behavior whenever he is near you, and yours near him, I have arrived to the conclusion that you might be a better prospect for a… Sorry, I´m not sure what could be the right term, let´s say… a closer involvement."  
真嗣在社交方面经验尚浅。他对真希波的关注，源于她以一种非对抗性的方式对他表示关注。然而，观察他接近你时的举止，以及你接近他时的反应，我推断你可能更适合与他建立一种……抱歉，我找不到确切的词，暂且称之为……更为亲密的联系。

Asuka frowned. Rei´s words made a certain kind of sense. She was still processing that last tidbit when Rei continued.  
明日香眉头紧锁。绫波的话确实有道理。她还在琢磨最后那句话时，绫波又接着说。

"Makinami isn´t malicious. It is simply her way. She behaves the same towards any male who catches her attention, until she gets bored and leaves. It is Shinji´s turn. Eventually, Makinami will tire of him and leave him behind. She has no idea of what that could do to him. Tell me, Soryu, what do you think would happen to Shinji then?"  
Makinami 并非出于恶意。这不过是她的行事方式。她对任何吸引她目光的男性都如此对待，直至厌倦后离去。如今轮到 Shinji 了。终有一天，Makinami 也会对他失去兴趣，弃他而去。她根本不清楚这会给 Shinji 带来怎样的后果。告诉我，Soryu，你认为 Shinji 到那时会如何？

The german pilot reacted violently to this prediction. "And- and why don´t you do something about it? You like him, don´t you?"  
德国飞行员对此预测反应强烈，质问道：“那你为何不采取行动？你不是挺喜欢他的吗？”

"There are several reasons. First, I am even less experienced in social interactions, I am sure you have noticed that. Second, my relation to him is of a very different nature. I am fond of him, very fond. He was the first person to treat me like a person, not as a freak or a monster. He has shown me the world through his eyes, and it has been amazing to notice things you take for granted. In a way, I´ll be his apprentice for as long as I live. Third, there is no physical attraction between us; we both are passive in temperament. You and Makinami are both of a more active temperament. While Shinji and I would grow stagnant should we engage in a relationship, you two would be a good influence for each other; he would ground you, and you would push him to do better."  
原因有几点。首先，我在社交方面的经验更为欠缺，这一点想必你已察觉。其次，我与他之间的关系非同寻常。我对他怀有深厚的感情，他是第一个将我视作普通人而非怪物的人。他让我透过他的视角看世界，那些你习以为常的事物，在我眼中却显得格外神奇。某种意义上，我将终身作为他的学徒。第三，我们之间并无肉体吸引；我们俩性格都偏于内向。而你和真希波则更为外向。如果真嗣和我在一起，我们可能会陷入停滞，但你们俩却能相互促进；他会让你保持稳重，你会激励他不断进步。

Rei continued. "You are jealous." She looked at Asuka with an intensity the demure First Child had never shown. Asuka looked away from those scarlet eyes. "The attraction between you and Shinji is not only clear, it is mutual. But he is afraid to offend you, so he keeps his distance or closes up in your presence. Have you seen him around Aida and Suzuhara? He behaves in a very relaxed way, you know. On the other hand, you are afraid of rejection; so you keep him at arm´s length, before he can get away."  
绫波接着说：“你在嫉妒。”她用一种从未有过的强烈眼神盯着明日香。明日香躲开了那双鲜红的眼睛。“你和真嗣之间的吸引力显而易见，而且是相互的。但他担心惹你不快，所以总是刻意与你保持距离，或者在你面前变得沉默寡言。你注意到他和相田、铃原相处时的样子了吗？他那时非常自在。而你，害怕被拒绝，所以总是先一步与他保持距离，以防他先离开。”

Finally, Asuka gulped and asked, "Hypothetically, and assuming that your delightfully deranged theory is even a little bit accurate, what are you proposing?"  
最终，明日香深吸一口气，问道：“假设，且不论你那颇为离奇的理论有多少准确性，你究竟想表达什么？”

"First, no more personal attacks. Aknowledge Shinji´s merits. Sparingly at first. Otherwise he would think it´s a set up to humiliate him. Second, ask for his help for something small, trival even; and thank him, sincerely. No sarcasm or back-handed compliments. Third, confide in him to keep a litle secret, something you wouldn´t care if it gets known. That would show you trust in him at a personal level. That would be a good start. The rest, I don´t really know. You should ask Captain Katsuragi or Horaki for more data."  
首先，停止人身攻击，认可真嗣的优点，但起初要适度，以免他觉得这是故意羞辱他。接着，请他帮忙做一件小事，哪怕是微不足道的；并真诚地感谢他，避免讽刺或含沙射影的恭维。然后，向他透露一个无关紧要的小秘密，以示你在个人层面上对他的信任。这样的开端会很不错。至于其他方面，我了解不多。你应该向葛城队长或堀木请教，以获得更多信息。

Asuka looked at her with suspicion. "And what do _**you**_ get out of all this." Carefully, Rei put her back on the floor. "Two happy friends, if everything goes right." She kept silent for a few seconds. "My friends are important to me."  
明日香带着疑虑的眼神望向她。“你又能从中得到什么呢？”绫波丽小心翼翼地将背靠回地面。“如果一切顺利，将会是两位快乐的朋友。”她沉默了片刻。“我的朋友们对我来说非常重要。”

Back on terra firma, Asuka adjusted her clothes back into a presentable look, still glaring at Rei. "Very well. I´ll think about it. But remember, First Child, if you are playing some kind of sick game with me, _**you will regret it**_."  
脚踏实地后，明日香整理了下衣着，恢复了得体的模样，依旧瞪着绫波。“行，我会考虑。但记住，一号机驾驶员，若你跟我玩什么卑鄙的把戏，你定会后悔莫及。”

"Understood. Before we go, we must have a reckoning. My behavior was unacceptable. I allowed myself to act emotionally. It was unprofessional on my part. Slap me."  
明白了。在离开前，我们得把事情说清楚。我的行为确实失当，我任由情绪左右，显得很不专业。请给我一记耳光。

"Whaaat?" 什么呀？

"Unprovoked personal assault." Rei sat on a bench, closed her eyes, and waited.  
"毫无缘由的个人攻击。" Rei 坐在长椅上，闭上眼睛，静静等待。

A moment later, she felt Asuka´s hand on her cheek. Two little slaps, without any force behind. "Oh, no, Wonder Girl. If your idea works, then I would have to receive a slap from you to even things out. So, let´s say if your idea fails, _**then**_ I will make you pay. Agreed?" Asuka poked Rei´s chest with a finger, underscoring her proposal.  
稍后，她感觉到明日香的手轻触她的脸颊，两下轻拍，毫无力道。"哦，不行，奇迹女孩。若你的主意成功，那我得挨你一巴掌才算公平。所以，如果这主意行不通，你可得付出代价。同意吗？"明日香用手指轻戳绫波的胸口，强调她的提议。

Rei opened her eyes, surprised; and nodded.  
玲睁开眼睛，显得有些惊讶，随后点了点头。

_**Author´s Notes 作者注记**_

Another scene I wrote without thinking much. I wondered just how Rei would act had she accepted Asuka´s offer of friendship. Sure, it wasn´t completely sincere on Asuka´s part, but she would never admit that.  
我随手写下的另一个场景，不禁好奇，若绫波接受了明日香的友谊邀请，她将如何反应。尽管明日香的提议并非全然真心，但她绝不会坦承这一点。

On the other hand, had Shinji found a girl who was really interested in knowing him, well… that would have worked wonders for his self-esteem. And also made Asuka crazy with jealousy (and it did, clearly shown after Shinji´s enforced vacation time at Unit-01 Hotel).  
另一方面，若真嗣遇到一个真心想了解他的女孩，这对他的自尊心将大有裨益。同时，这也会让明日香嫉妒不已（事实证明确实如此，尤其在真嗣被迫在零号机酒店度假期间表现得淋漓尽致）。

A third party could have mediated between them and explained things to both.  
原本可以有第三方介入，向双方阐明情况，进行调解。

(*) The song Mari is singing is "_**Mi Gran Noche" ("My Great Night");**_ sung by _Raphael_. The part she is singing here means "Today for me is a special day, I´ll go out tonight!" (The "Pam, para, ¡pam!" is just a series of onomatopeias), and the rest is the singer planning his big date with his girlfriend, but as it is sung in first person, it only requires minimal changes to work for a female singer. The song was used in the Mexican dub for a Simpsons episode, instead of the original song; it was the one where Bart got a crush on his babysitter; IIRC.  
玛丽演唱的歌曲名为"Mi Gran Noche"（我的伟大之夜），原唱者是拉斐尔。她所唱的这一段表达的是“今天对我而言意义非凡，今晚我将外出！”（“Pam, para, ¡pam!”仅为一串拟声词），而歌曲的其余部分则是歌手与女友的浪漫约会计划，由于采用第一人称，稍作调整便适合女歌手演绎。这首歌在墨西哥版《辛普森一家》中被用作替代原曲，出现在巴特迷恋保姆的那一集中。

"It had been, after all, a very good idea." Asuka exclaimed, beaming at Shinji, who returned her smile and kissed her cheek. "And I have no shame to admit it was not mine. That one was all on Rei's" She tilted her glass towards the bluenette.  
"毕竟，这确实是个绝妙的主意。" 明日香兴奋地对真嗣说，真嗣也报以微笑，并在她脸颊上轻吻。"我坦然承认，这主意并非出自我的想法。这完全是零的功劳。" 她向那位蓝发女孩举杯示意。

"And it worked even better than I had expected." Rei poured some juice in her glass. "We all benefited."  
结果比我预想的还要好。" Rei 往杯子里倒了些果汁，说道："我们都从中得到了好处。

Next to her, Mari Ilustrious Makinami held Rei's hand. "Not all of us." she whispered, flashing her impish smile as she looked around. "The Old Creeps certainly threw a tantrum!" she laughed. "Brief as it was."  
在她身旁，真希波·真理·伊拉丝多莉亚斯紧握着绫波的手。“并非所有人都这样。”她轻声细语，带着俏皮的微笑环视四周。“那些老顽固真是大闹了一场！”她笑着说，“尽管只是昙花一现。”

Pen-Pen entered the room, running away from the toddler following him, both waddling precariously on their short legs. Behind her, Misato Katsuragi hurried to catch her before she could bring the table down. "Sorry, kids, got one live one here." she tickled the baby until both laughed. "Who's a good girl, Ritsi? You are!"  
企鹅 Pen-Pen 跑进房间，身后紧跟着一个步履蹒跚的小孩，两者都用小短腿摇摇晃晃地走着。葛城美里紧随其后，生怕她把桌子弄翻。“不好意思，小家伙们，这里有个调皮的。”她逗弄着宝宝，直到两人都笑出声来。“谁是乖宝宝，Ritsi？就是你呀！”

"Hey, Misato!" Shinji stood up to hug her once guardian, while Rei scratched the zone right above Pen-Pen's beak, which had the penguin tapping rhythmically on the floor with his left foot. "You look great!"  
嘿，美里！" 真嗣起身拥抱了他的监护人，与此同时，绫波轻挠着企鹅 Pen-Pen 喙上方的部位，逗得它用左脚有节奏地敲打着地面。"你看起来状态真好！

Misato preened for a moment, but had to grip the baby firmly as she tried to grab Shinji's nose. "Oh, well, Kaji keeps me in shape, you know." She enjoyed the reddening of her once ward's face, before adding "We're training to run the marathon!"  
真嗣稍作打扮，却不得不牢牢抱住试图去捏真嗣鼻子的宝宝。“哎，卡吉帮我保持体形呢。”她看着昔日照顾的少年脸红，不禁莞尔，接着说：“我们正为马拉松训练呢！”

The group laughed. Asuka took a sip from her glass, "Speaking of Kaji, where is he?"  
大家笑了起来。明日香抿了一口杯中的饮料，问道：“提到薰，他去哪儿了？”

"He's picking up some stuff for the babies. You group of reprobates are on babysitting duty this week, and we want to be sure you have everything at hand." She barely manage to count with her fingers, "Diapers, formula, diapers, bottles, toys, diapers, clothes, diapers, beer." She laughed, "Believe me, you are gonna need that last one by the end of the day!"  
他正在为宝宝们准备一些必需品。你们这帮家伙本周负责照看孩子，我们得确保你们手头应有尽有。"她勉强用手指计算着，"尿布、奶粉、尿布、奶瓶、玩具、尿布、衣服、尿布、啤酒。"她笑着说，"相信我，到一天结束时，你们绝对会需要那最后一项的！

Mari pushed her glasses up her nose, smiling mischieviously. "Weeeeell… Rei and I would like to…"  
玛丽推了推鼻梁上的眼镜，狡黠一笑：“这个嘛……丽和我打算……”

"Accept!" Raising a hand, and still scratching Pen-Pen with the other; Rei interrupted her with an enthusiasm no one would have expected from her, back when the quartet had been in school together. "We would like to accept. First shift!" she demanded to the general laughter of everybody present. Mari smiled her cat-like smile, as if that had been her plan all the time. And from what they knew, it had been.  
"我们接受！" 丽一边举手，一边还用另一只手逗弄着 Pen-Pen，她那出乎意料的热情让在场的每个人都感到惊讶，毕竟在学校时她从未如此。"我们愿意承担第一班！" 她大声宣布，引得众人一阵欢笑。玛丽则露出了她那狡黠的微笑，似乎这一切都在她的预料之中。而事实也确实如此。

Later that night, after finally convincing both babies to sleep, the adults retired to their respective rooms, the members of the group took some time to remember and to reflect on their lives. And how an unasked advice had changed their lives for the better.  
那天深夜，好不容易哄睡两个宝宝后，大人们各自回房，团队成员们借此机会回忆和反思自己的生活。他们感慨，一个未曾请求的建议竟让生活焕然一新。

---

Shinji Ikari thought on the fiery redhead who had captured his heart. He clearly remembered how she looked the day they had met. Her twin pigtails, shining red under the sun, on the deck of the _Over the Rainbow_. He would have loved to take her there once again, but the big ship had been decommissioned some time after the battle against Gaghiel, and was now a floating museum, to Kensuke's chagrin. The ship was now permanently anchored in New San Francisco, at the other side of the world. Shinji smiled at the thought of his friend saving every possible yen to go there and set foot on the ship once again. He was a bit oblivious to the fact that the only reason he could set foot on the ship again was because of its being decommissioned. Had it still been in active service, the Over the Rainbow would bee off limits for Kensuke, being just a civilian.  
碇真嗣心中浮现出那位红发女孩的身影，她深深吸引了他。他清晰记得初遇时她的样子：阳光下，她那双红色的马尾辫在“彩虹之上”号的甲板上闪耀。他曾梦想再次带她前往，但与加吉尔的战斗后，这艘船不久便退役，变成了漂浮的博物馆，让剑介感到惋惜。如今，它永久停泊在新旧金山，远在世界另一端。想到剑介为了再次踏上那艘船，正努力攒钱，真嗣不禁微笑。他未曾意识到，能再次登船，全因它已退役。 倘若“彩虹之上”号依旧在役，身为平民的健介便无法靠近。

His mind returned to those strange few days after Mari Makinami had arrived to Japan. She was energetic, but careful; eccentric to the core of her being, optimistic, and, well… happy. He had no idea, even after all this time, of just what had made her ask him on a date. But he was glad he had, hesitantly, said yes. Those three weeks had been a complete whirlwind, even taking into account the Angel attack in the middle of the second week.  
他的思绪飘回到真希波·真理初抵日本的那段不寻常时光。她活力四射却谨慎行事；性格古怪至极，乐观开朗，总之……非常快乐。时至今日，他仍不清楚是什么驱使她向他提出约会。但他庆幸自己犹豫后还是答应了。那三周过得如同旋风一般，即便中间遭遇了第二周的天使袭击。

They hadn't really worked out as a couple, and Mari let him down with a gentleness he was still grateful for. Did it hurt? Yes, but somehow, being dumped by Mari had left him standing tall, instead of broken. Mari was just that good at talking to people.  
他们作为情侣并未真正磨合成功，玛丽以一种他至今仍感激的温柔态度与他分手。这当然痛苦，但奇怪的是，被玛丽甩掉后，他反而更加挺拔，而非一蹶不振。玛丽与人沟通的技巧确实高超。

But by then, Asuka had already started to change her behavior. She was so much more… he looked for a word for a long time, and settled on mellow. It would be a long time before he got to know exactly what had happened.  
然而，那时明日香的行为已悄然转变。她变得更为……他思索良久，才找到“温婉”一词来形容。要彻底洞悉背后的缘由，尚需时日。

He smiled in the dark, and grabbed for his lover's hand. It was tightened in a fist. Knowing her, something was bothering her, but after several incidents, he had learned to give her some space, wait for her to work things out. All he really needed to do, was to let her know he was there for her, should she want to talk things through.  
他在暗处微微一笑，伸手去握爱人的手，却发现她紧握成拳。他知道，她心里一定有事。经过几次类似的情况，他学会了给她空间，让她自己慢慢理清思绪。他只需让她明白，如果她愿意倾诉，他始终在旁守候。

Her hand relaxed after a few seconds, and he rubbed the ring on her finger with his thumb.  
几秒后，她的手松了下来，他用拇指轻抚着她手指上的戒指。

---

Rei Ikari snuggled against her partner, in crime and in other things.  
碇真嗣紧靠着她的伙伴，无论是共谋之事还是其他方面。

She smiled satisfied. Of all the unexpected consequences her bit of unasked advice had brought on, that Mari had ended up being the love of her life had to be the most unexpected.  
她满意地微笑着。她那番未请自来的建议所引发的一系列意外后果中，玛丽竟成了她生命中的至爱，这无疑是最令人意想不到的。

The brit girl had turned out to be her perfect counterpart, eerily mirroring her own advice to Asuka. She grounded Mari's flightiness and eccentricities with her hard-earned common sense, while Mari had brought her out of her shell with unending patience and tenderness.  
那位英国女孩出乎意料地成了她的理想伴侣，奇妙地呼应了她对明日香的忠告。她凭借自己积累的常识，平衡了真里的轻浮与独特，而真里则以无限的耐心和温柔，帮助她走出了自我封闭。

Maybe a wedding wouldn't be in their future, but it didn't really matter. She was happy now, free of the machinations that had shaped her early years. Free of the machines that copied her mind, free of the destiny Gendo Ikari had imposed onto her, driven by his madness.  
也许他们不会有婚礼，但这已无关紧要。她如今感到幸福，摆脱了早年那些操控她的阴谋，摆脱了复制她心智的机器，摆脱了碇源堂因疯狂而强加于她的宿命。

For a moment, she thought of the man who had brought her into the world. But the cute chipmunk noises that passed for Mari's snoring brought her back to the present. There was no reason to dwell into the past.  
有那么一刻，她想起了将她带到世上的那个男人。然而，玛丽那如同可爱花栗鼠般的鼾声又将她拉回了现实。沉湎于过去并无必要。

Into the reason for her very existence.  
探寻她存在的真正缘由。

She banished the Former Commander of NERV Japan's face and voice from her thoughts, and listened to her beloved's breathing.  
她将日本 NERV 前指挥官的容颜与声音从脑海中抹去，专注聆听心上人的呼吸声。

---

Gendo Ikari still wondered what had happened. How his carefully constructed plans had failed at the very moment of his apotheosis.  
源渡依旧困惑于究竟发生了什么。他那精心策划的计划，怎会在即将登峰造极之际功亏一篑。

He barely noticed the small confines of his cell. Considering once again if there was a way to escape.  
他几乎未曾留意自己牢房的局促，再次思索着是否有逃脱的可能。

His odds were not good.  
他成功的可能性不高。

He, along with the surviving members of SEELE's Inner Circle, was imprisoned in an unusual jail. They had all been publicly executed after their failed attempt to start Third Impact, their part in Second Impact and on the abortive Third Impact had been brought to light by that damned spy, Ryoji Kaji, may he burn in Hell forever!  
他与 SEELE 内圈的幸存者一同被关押在一所奇特的监狱里。由于企图引发第三次冲击失败，他们因涉及第二次冲击及未遂的第三次冲击，被公开处决。这一切的曝光，都归咎于那个可恶的间谍——加持良治，愿他永受地狱之火的煎熬！

The conspirators had been sentenced to die by lethal injection, their executions broadcast to the whole world. However, the executioner answered to a higher authority.  
阴谋者被判以注射死刑，其处决过程向全球公开播放。但执行者服从于更高级别的权威。

Kiehl was confident he and his cronies would awake in one of his luxurious secret enclaves, ready and willing to continue their plans.  
基尔坚信，他和他的同伙们将在他那奢华的秘密据点中苏醒，随时准备继续推进他们的计划。

However, they had not counted on just how vindictive Dr. Ritsuko Akagi could be.  
然而，他们未曾料到赤木律子博士竟会如此怀恨在心。

The former science chief of NERV Japan had infiltrated their plans. The conspirators didn't know it, but Ryoji Kaji had been the one to actually put Akagi's plans in motion.  
日本 NERV 的前首席科学家已悄然介入他们的计划。那些策划者们尚未察觉，实际上是加持良治在背后推动了赤木的计划。

The drug that would serve to fake their deaths had been cleverly modified. Instead of simply reducing their vitals, allowing for a later revivification, the drug had permanently shut down their voluntary movements.  
用于假死的那款药物经过巧妙改造，不仅能暂时降低生命体征以备后续复活，还永久性地终止了他们的自主运动能力。

They were completely paralyzed. Not even able to open or close their eyes without help.  
他们彻底瘫痪，连睁眼闭眼这样的动作都需要他人帮助。

They would live out their lives surrounded by their secret enclave, tended by nurses who didn't even know who they were.  
他们将在秘密的聚居地终老，周围是那些甚至不知他们身份的护士的照料。

The only thing they could look forward to, was the release of death.  
他们唯一盼望的，便是死亡的释放。

And not a single one of them knew just how vindictive Rei Ayanami could be.  
他们之中，竟无一人知晓绫波丽内心的报复心有多强。

She had helped Dr. Akagi to realize a part of SEELE's collective dream.  
她助力赤木博士，让 SEELE 的集体梦想得以部分实现。

Both women had implanted part of Rei's angelic genetic template into the drug, in the form of a retrovirus that invaded each and every cell of their bodies, subtly rewriting their very essence.  
两位女性都将绫的天使基因模板的一部分植入药物，通过逆转录病毒侵入她们身体的每个细胞，悄然改写她们的本质。

They were functionally immortal.  
他们实际上拥有不朽之身。

Immortal statues. 永恒的雕像。

Unable to die, unable to live.  
既不能死，也无法活。

They were even unable to find a refuge in madness.  
他们连在疯狂中寻求庇护都做不到。

For Lorenz Kiehl, the main conspirator, the punishment was even worse. His body tried constantly to heal the ravages time had left on it, but the multiple cybernetic implants in his body, than once had helped him to retain his sight and mobility, now were like splinters imbedded in his flesh, adding an unending agony to his sentence.  
对于主谋洛伦兹·基尔而言，惩罚尤为残酷。他的身体始终在努力修复岁月带来的损伤，然而，那些曾助他维持视力和行动的多个赛博植入体，现在却如同刺入肉中的碎片，给他的刑期带来了无休止的折磨。

Mari hugged Rei as if the bluenette was her favorite teddy bear. And in a way, she was. Despite her always happy exterior, Mari was prone to bouts of melancholy. For a long time, she had worked hard to keep a happy face all the time.  
玛丽紧紧拥抱着瑞，仿佛这个蓝发女孩就是她最心爱的泰迪熊。在某种意义上，瑞确实扮演着这样的角色。尽管玛丽总是面带笑容，但她内心却时常感到忧郁。长久以来，她一直努力维持着这份表面的快乐。

Rei had seen through her mask. She had never asked, but Mari was almost sure it had been during their first meeting, when she was introduced as the Fourth Child, brought from Bethany Base to reinforce Tokyo-3's pool of pilots with her gangly Unit-5, standing over the four long legs ending on tracked skates. Privately, she called Unit-5 "Skatey Spidey", but didn't tolerate any insults towards her machine, as the Fifth Child, Toji Suzuhara, had eventually learned.  
丽早已识破了她的面具。尽管从未明言，但玛丽几乎可以肯定，这一切始于他们初次相遇之际，那时她作为第四适格者被介绍给大家，从贝瑟尼基地调来增强东京-3 的驾驶员队伍。她那瘦长的五号机，四条长腿下装着履带滑轮，屹立在那里。私下里，她戏称五号机为“滑轮蜘蛛侠”，却绝不容忍任何对它的不敬，第五适格者铃原东治后来也领教了这一点。

Her thoughts went back to Rei. She had been amazed to find a good listener. When she realized they weren't working as a couple, Mari began to worry Shinji might take it hard, but Rei had known what to say to ease her worries, and counseled on the best way to break things with the shy boy.  
她的思绪飘向了绫波。她意外地找到了一个善解人意的倾听者。意识到两人并不适合做伴侣后，玛丽担心真嗣会难以承受，然而绫波懂得如何安抚她的忧虑，并给出了与这位内向少年分手的最佳建议。

She smiled at the memory, eventually she had found out that Rei had rushed Asuka to leave the dressing room for the pilots, before Mari had finished her shower. As she was about to leave, Rei had grabbed her by the arm, with an even more serious face than usual, she had said the words that would end up changing her whole world. "_Makinami, we have to talk. About Shinji_."  
她对着回忆微笑，最终得知，在玛丽洗完澡前，丽急忙让明日香离开了驾驶员更衣室。就在她即将离开之际，丽抓住她的手臂，比往常更加严肃地吐露了那句将彻底改变她世界的话：“真希波，我们得谈谈。关于真嗣。”

Then, the bluenette had proceeded to lay down the law. The fact that Mari was taller and more muscular had meant nothing to the First Child. Somehow, she dominated her completely with her soft spoken words. That she was also offering help to break with Shinji without hurting the shy Third Child was the cherry on top.  
接着，那位蓝发女孩便开始立规矩。尽管玛丽身材更高大、肌肉更健硕，但这在第一适格者面前毫无作用。她仅凭温和的话语就彻底掌控了局面。更难得的是，她还提出帮助玛丽与真嗣和平分手，避免伤害到那位内向的第三适格者。

Weeks later, Rei had found her during one of her infrequent crying bouts. Instead of saying anything, she simply nodded, sat next to her, and let the Fourth Child cry on her shoulder to her heart's content. They never spoke about that event, which Mari appreciated immensely.  
数周后，绫波在一次难得的哭泣时刻找到了她。她并未言语，仅是点头示意，坐到她身旁，任由第四适格者尽情地倚靠在她肩头哭泣。两人对此事心照不宣，真里深感欣慰。

From that moment on, they were inseparable.  
自那一刻起，他们便如影随形，难舍难分。

Toji Suzuhara was looking forward to the next weekend, he hugged his young and beautiful wife, and looked deeply into her eyes. Hikari held his gaze, and hugged him back.  
铃原东治对即将到来的周末满怀期待，他紧紧拥抱着年轻貌美的妻子，深情地凝望着她的双眼。光迎着他的目光，同样紧紧地回抱了他。

"Well… I think Kensuke will have a bet to collect. " she whispered.  
"嗯…看来 Kensuke 要赢取赌注了。" 她轻声细语。

"Ah, yeah. I don't mind paying, though I hope Shinji will manage to tame the Red Demon!"  
啊，没错。我倒是不介意付钱，只是希望真嗣能成功驯服那红魔！

"Toji! Don't call her that!"  
冬二！别那么称呼她！

He smiled, "Okay, Red Imp better?" Hikari slapped him in the arm. "No! Asuka is my best friend, and unless you'd like to sleep on the couch, you'll be respectful."  
他笑着问：“那叫红鬼怎么样？”光拍了一下他的胳膊。“不行！明日香是我最好的朋友，你要是不想睡沙发，就请对她尊重些。”

"Aw, she knows I don't mean no insult. She still calls me Jock Stooge, for goodness sake."  
哎呀，她明白我并无冒犯之意。她还是戏称我为傀儡杰克，真是的。

"I'll have to talk to her about that."  
我得就那件事和她谈谈。

"Nah, don't bother. I like being Jock Stooge." He puffed his chest. "Your Jock Stooge." He wrapped his arms around Hikari, and held her close.  
"得了，不用费心。我就乐意做体育健将的小跟班。" 他骄傲地挺直胸膛，"属于你的小跟班。" 他张开双臂，将光拥入怀中。

"All mine." She whispered, before kissing him softly.  
"都是我的。"她轻声细语，随后温柔地吻了他。

Asuka thought on just how much courageous Shinji had been after he and Mari had broken. They were still friendly towards each other, and the young pilot still had a place in his heart for the irrepressible brown-haired girl. A _very platonic_ place, Asuka knew.  
明日香思索着，真嗣在与玛丽分手后展现出了何等的勇气。尽管如此，他们依旧保持着友好关系，真嗣心中依然为那位充满活力的棕发女孩保留了一份纯真的情感。

Her own thoughts drifted to just how difficult, and how rewarding, had been to change her usual pattern of behavior. She could see how Shinji matured under her guidance. And she herself found her deep emotional wounds had begun to close.  
她思绪飘忽，回想起改变自己一贯行为模式的艰辛与收获。她目睹了真嗣在她的指导下逐渐成熟。同时，她自己深藏的情感创伤也已开始愈合。

After their second first kiss, she knew he was hers, just as much as she was his.  
第二次初吻后，她深知他已属于她，正如她亦属于他。

And that was just how she liked it.  
她正喜欢这样。

Sure, they had had some rough times; but somehow, they always managed to get over them.  
确实，他们曾遭遇过一些坎坷；但无论如何，他们总能设法度过难关。

Even…

She pressed her lips together. Arael almost had destroyed her with its visions of abandonment and rejection. All her issues came out to light in a single moment.  
她紧闭双唇。阿瑞尔的幻象，充斥着被遗弃和拒绝的恐惧，几乎将她击垮。所有心结在那一刻尽数浮现。

All the emotional pain she had worked incessantly to hide under a thick layer of bravado and anger came back in a rush.  
她竭力以虚张声势和愤怒掩盖的情感痛苦，突然如潮水般涌回心头。

She remembered the hard impact against Unit-02 as if it had been yesterday.  
她记忆中与二号机猛烈撞击的情景历历在目，恍若昨日。

Shinji, piloting Unit-01 as if he rode a hell horse, had almost knocked her out from Arael's beam, and then shielded her with Unit-01 until Rei and Mari had managed to kill the Angel.  
真嗣驾驶初号机，犹如驾驭地狱烈马，险些被使徒阿拉尔的光束击昏，之后用初号机为她挡下攻击，直至绫波和真希波合力将使徒消灭。

Staying under the beam for long and painful minutes had opened their minds and souls to each other. And from then on, they both had an instinctive understanding of each other. Even beyond the synchronicity they had developed before they faced Israfel.  
长时间痛苦地站在光束下，使他们的心灵和灵魂彼此敞开。自那以后，他们之间便有了本能的理解，甚至超越了面对伊斯拉斐尔之前所培养的默契。

Despite trying to destroy them, all Arael had managed to do was to get them closer.  
尽管阿拉蕾试图摧毁它们，结果却只是让它们更加团结。

Still, spending that long in quarantine, separated from each other while Dr. Akagi tested them to hell and back to be sure they had not been angelically contaminated…  
尽管如此，在隔离中度过那么长时间，彼此分离，赤木医生则对他们进行了反复严苛的检测，确保他们未受天使污染……

She closed her hand in a fist, and Shinji's bigger hand covered hers, easing her anguish in a single instant. His long fingers caressed her hand tenderly, especially over the ring he had given her just two weeks before.  
她紧握成拳，真嗣的大手随即覆上，顷刻间抚慰了她的痛楚。他那修长的手指温柔地摩挲着她的手，尤其在两周前他赠予她的戒指处流连。

She turned around to face him, kissing him tenderly.  
她转身面向他，温柔地吻了上去。

They needed no words. 他们无需言语交流。

He knew. 他心里明白。  
She knew. 她心里明白。

They were. 他们的确如此。  
Together. 共同。

Now and Always. 始终如一。

_**Author Notes: 作者笔记：**_

After a few PMs with AuthorofIntent (go check his stories! _NERV gets Juiced_ is a funny take on what happens when NERV is attacked by the Ghost with the Most: Beetlejuice himself!), I got the idea for a second chapter of this story. However, I didn't want to detail the whole story, therefore, this epilogue.  
在与 AuthorofIntent 通过几次私信交流后（不妨去读读他的作品，《NERV 遭遇恶搞》以幽默笔触描绘了 NERV 被幽灵界最调皮的 Beetlejuice 袭击的情景！），我产生了续写这个故事第二章的念头。但我不打算展开整个故事，于是就有了这篇尾声。

The scene of Pen-Pen being chased by a toddler comes from the sequel to one of my favorites Peggy Sue fics of Evangelion, _The 2nd Try_, by JimmyWolk, after the prose story ended, he put pencil to the paper, drawing the sequel, _Aki-chan's Life_.  
场景中企鹅 Pen-Pen 被小孩追赶的情节，出自我最喜爱的《新世纪福音战士》同人作品《第二次尝试》的续集，该续集由 JimmyWolk 创作。在《第二次尝试》的文字故事完结后，他继续以画笔描绘了后续故事《Aki-chan 的生活》。

Personally, _The 2__nd_ _Try_ is my head canon for what happened after EoE.  
个人来说，《The 2nd Try》是我心目中《EoE》结局后的真实发展。

Another big influence was _Advice and Trust_, by Panther2G/Strygpia, especially the relationship of Shinji and Asuka. The story is now entering the Endgame phase, so please go and read it, it´s a big rollercoaster of emotions!  
另一部极具影响力的作品是《Advice and Trust》，作者 Panther2G/Strygpia，其中真嗣与明日香的关系尤为引人注目。故事正步入尾声，强烈推荐你去阅读，它将带你体验一场情感的跌宕起伏！
