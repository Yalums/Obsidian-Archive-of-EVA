Shinji and Asuka have bit more than one kiss in episode 15...FLUFF  
在第 15 集中，真嗣和明日香不止一次接吻...甜蜜温馨

---
a/n: This is pretty much an extension of episode 15. I tried to make it more original so do not complain if I didn't follow the episode exactly though it starts off from the kiss between Asuka and Shinji.  
作者注：这基本上是第 15 集的延续。我尝试让它更具原创性，所以如果我没有完全按照那一集的情节走，请不要抱怨，尽管故事是从明日香和真嗣的吻开始的。

"Hey Shinji," I heard a familiar voice say. I turned around and Asuka was standing there right in front of me. There was nobody around except for me and her in the apartment. I guess the only thing preventing me was my lack of self confidence. Stupid puberty, it's like the worst time ever. I hate it.  
"嘿，真嗣，" 我听到一个熟悉的声音说道。我转过身，看到明日香就站在我面前。公寓里除了我和她，没有其他人。我想唯一阻止我的就是我缺乏自信。愚蠢的青春期，简直是最糟糕的时期。我讨厌它。

"What?" I ask trying not to sound too excited. Every time I thought of Asuka, the perfection she was, the sound of her voice, the attention she gives me regardless whether it is anger or not makes my blood rush, my heart thump hard. And if I'm alone, I also end up fantasizing. Stupid puberty as I said before.  
"什么？" 我问道，尽量不显得太兴奋。每次想到明日香，她的完美，她的声音，她对我的关注，无论是生气与否，都让我血液沸腾，心跳加速。如果只有我一个人，我还会陷入幻想。就像我之前说的，愚蠢的青春期。

"I'm bored, have you ever been kissed before?" she asked. What a ridiculous question. As if I have ever been kissed. Who would ever want to kiss me anyway?  
"我无聊了，你以前接过吻吗？" 她问道。多么荒谬的问题。好像我有过接吻经历似的。反正谁会想吻我呢？

"No." I said bluntly. "不。" 我直截了当地说。

"Well, I'm bored. Let's kiss."  
"好吧，我无聊了。我们来亲吻吧。"

"What?" I asked surprised. "Why do you want to do that?"  
"什么？" 我惊讶地问。"你为什么想这么做？"

"I'm bored Shinji! You never listen do you…" and after that she brought her face closer to me and kissed me on the lips. "Hey, stop breathing! You're tickling me," she said. She pinched my nose. Now I really couldn't breathe.  
"我好无聊，真嗣！你从来不听我的，对吧……" 说完，她把脸凑近我，吻了我的嘴唇。"嘿，别呼吸！你弄得我痒痒的，" 她说道。她捏住了我的鼻子。这下我真的一点气都喘不上来了。

'Help me,' I tried to say but I couldn't make a noise as all my airways were blocked. I began to get a headache and also felt a blush appear on my face. Why she kissed me apart from boredom I couldn't answer. I hoped that boredom wasn't really the truth. I hoped that she liked me. Cos God I liked her.  
'救命啊，' 我想说却发不出声音，因为我的呼吸道全被堵住了。我开始感到头痛，脸上也泛起了红晕。她除了无聊之外为什么吻我，我无法回答。我希望无聊不是真正的理由。我希望她喜欢我。因为天啊，我喜欢她。

I couldn't guess how long the kiss went. Could've gone for a minute to an hour. I was out of breath and couldn't decide nor care less. She finally stopped though and ran to the bathroom.  
我猜不出那个吻持续了多久。可能是一分钟，也可能是一个小时。我喘不过气来，既无法决定也不在乎了。她终于停了下来，跑进了浴室。

"I'll never, ever, ever kiss again to pass time." She said disgustedly as she gargled her mouth out with water. Was it my fault that she kissed me? All I knew was that I longed for more.  
“我再也不会，永远，永远，为了打发时间而接吻了。”她厌恶地说着，用水漱口。她吻我难道是我的错吗？我只知道我渴望更多。

I crept towards the bathroom and saw she was still gargling her mouth out with water. She looked up in the mirror and saw me in the doorway.  
我悄悄走向浴室，看到她还在用水漱口。她抬头在镜子里看到了站在门口的我。

"What are you doing? Staring at me like that. It's rude you know! Didn't anybody ever teach you that?" she said a matter-of-factly. Typical of her. I already got used it though.  
“你在干什么？那样盯着我看。这很无礼，你知道吗！没人教过你吗？”她直截了当地说。她就是这样。不过我已经习惯了。

"That kiss, why did you do that?" I asked shyly. That was one of my low points. I never had much confidence.  
"那个吻，你为什么那么做？" 我羞涩地问道。那是我低谷时刻之一。我从未有过太多自信。

"I told you! I was bored! Why? Did you like it?" she asked. That had me over the barrel. I never wanted to tell her that. I never think things through. Just act on impulse.  
"我告诉过你！我无聊了！怎么？你喜欢吗？" 她问。这让我束手无策。我从未想告诉她。我从不深思熟虑。只是凭冲动行事。

"Yes…" I said. That was difficult to say. I felt that all too familiar blush on my face again.  
"是的…" 我说。这很难说出口。我感到那熟悉的脸红再次袭上脸颊。

Before I knew it, somehow I had managed to bring Asuka to the couch and we were kissing as though there was no tomorrow. This was no longer that simple fun kiss like before. This was more serious. As our tongues battled wars in each others mouths, I ran my hands down her body, over her curving breasts, down her slim form and down to her curves at the bottom.  
不知不觉间，我竟然设法把明日香带到了沙发上，我们忘情地拥吻，仿佛世界末日即将来临。这不再是之前那种简单的、充满乐趣的吻。这一次，更加认真。我们的舌头在彼此的口中激战，我双手沿着她的身体滑下，掠过她曲线优美的胸部，顺着她纤细的身形，直至她下身的曲线。

She was pulling me in closer by wrapping her arms around my back and holding me there, making sure I never left her. I never was going to leave her, not now. Not when my heart was bursting with happiness now. So many things I had achieved.  
她用双臂环抱住我的背部，将我拉得更近，确保我永远不会离开她。我从未想过要离开她，尤其是现在，我的心因幸福而膨胀。我实现了那么多事情。

I continued to taste her as we continued to fight for dominance inside. As usual, she had to try to get the better of me. No way was I going to let her have the satisfaction of winning. No, this time I was going to claim the title. I was going to win this battle. But first I needed another breath of air.  
我们继续在内部争夺主导权，我继续品尝着她。像往常一样，她试图胜过我。我绝不会让她得到胜利的满足感。不，这次我要夺取胜利的头衔。我要赢得这场战斗。但首先，我需要再呼吸一口空气。

As I pulled away, she moaned in protest and moved her hands up behind my neck to try and pull me in closer again. It took only a second for me to breathe and I bent over again going closer for the kill.  
当我抽身离开时，她不满地呻吟着，双手攀上我的后颈，试图再次将我拉近。我只用了一秒钟呼吸，便再次俯身靠近，准备一举拿下。

We continued to kiss away for how long I don't know anymore. But after what seemed like a long time we stopped. I sat up to give Asuka some more space and she leaned up a little, balancing herself on her elbows.  
我们继续吻了多久，我已经记不清了。但似乎过了很久，我们才停下来。我坐起身来，给明日香多留些空间，她微微撑起身体，用肘部保持平衡。

"That was amazing…" She said in between pants trying to regulate her breathing again. "…and so much fun." She whispered into my ear. I think my confidence had boosted that night into such frenzy as I was having the time of my life.  
“那真是太棒了……”她喘息着，努力调整呼吸，“……而且非常有趣。”她在我耳边低语。我想那晚我的自信飙升到了极点，因为我正享受着生命中最美好的时光。

I tackled her back into a lying down position and started tickling her, running my fingers in funny directions on her sides.  
我猛地将她扑倒，让她重新躺下，然后开始挠她痒痒，手指在她两侧以滑稽的方向游走。

She began laughing and saying things like 'stop it'. Normally I wouldn't have done something like that but tonight I was on some high and continued. I then reached down for another kiss which she gladly accepted.  
她开始笑了起来，说着'别闹了'之类的话。平时我绝不会做这种事，但今晚我情绪高涨，继续逗她。接着，我俯身再次吻她，她欣然接受。

I stopped tickling her and we were in our own world again. Of course, in reality we were in our own world pretty much, locked inside and apartment with nobody inside but ourselves.  
我停止了挠痒，我们又回到了自己的小世界。当然，实际上我们几乎一直都在自己的世界里，被锁在公寓内，除了我们自己，别无他人。

Again, the battle for dominance was fought with our tongues as we slipped in and out of each others mouths, trying to get a breath of air every now and then and pretty much just enjoying ourselves.  
又一次，我们用舌头展开了主导权的争夺战，唇齿间进进出出，时不时试图喘口气，基本上就是在享受彼此。

Eventually though, we did finally stop and didn't continue anymore. I was tired now and I went to take a bath while Asuka went on the phone to talk to Hikari.  
不过最终，我们确实停了下来，没有再继续。我现在累了，去洗澡，而明日香则打电话给光。

I didn't stay in that long otherwise I had a feeling I would've fallen asleep. So I went out early and Asuka took her turn in the bath taking the phone with her just like Misato does. I set up my futon and then lay down, listening to my music, and now that I had calmed down enough I started thinking about Asuka.  
我没有泡太久，否则我感觉自己会睡着。所以我早早出来，明日香接着去洗澡，带着电话，就像美里那样。我铺好被褥，躺下，听着音乐，现在我平静了许多，开始思考明日香。

It didn't turn out terribly successful as all I ended up doing was fantasize about her. I felt so sleazy that I refused to think about her anymore until I was forced when she came into the room.  
结果并不算太成功，因为我最终只是在幻想她。我感到如此卑鄙，以至于我拒绝再想她，直到她走进房间逼得我不得不想。

"Oh, why couldn't you have set up my futon Shinji?" Asuka asked in a whiny manner and then yawned.  
“哦，为什么你不帮我铺好被褥呢，真嗣？”明日香用一种撒娇的语气问道，然后打了个哈欠。

I didn't say anything, not because I felt guilty but because it was such a stupid question. I may have kissed her but that didn't mean I should have to do everything for her. Ok, maybe that shows the extent of my selfishness but did I really have to do everything? I was tired as well.  
我什么也没说，不是因为我感到内疚，而是因为这是个愚蠢的问题。我可能吻过她，但这并不意味着我应该为她做所有事。好吧，也许这显示了我的自私程度，但我真的必须做所有事吗？我也累了。

She set up her futon so it was right next to mine and lay down after turning off the light. "Don't worry Shinji, I was only joking." She whispered as she closed her eyes.  
她把她的蒲团铺得紧挨着我的，关了灯后躺下。“别担心，真嗣，我只是在开玩笑。”她闭上眼睛轻声说道。

She fell asleep almost instantaneously. I fell asleep soon afterwards. However, I knew that next time we had the apartment to ourselves, things may get a little bit more out of hand…  
她几乎立刻就睡着了。我也很快进入了梦乡。然而，我知道下次当我们独自待在公寓里时，事情可能会变得有点失控……

Fine 好的

a/n: With some advice, I decided to redo chapter 2 in which no lemon will be available making the story a bit more suitable for younger audiences  
作者注：在得到一些建议后，我决定重写《1001》第二部，其中将不再包含柠檬情节，使故事更适合年轻观众阅读

Maybe I shouldn't have done it. Not 'it' of course. But ever since that night I have been looking at Shinji in a more longingly manner. Not such that I lust for him. Ok, I'll say the truth, maybe I do lust for him. A bit. But that's not what you should be worried about.  
或许我不该那么做。当然不是指‘那件事’。但从那晚起，我对真嗣的目光就变得愈发渴望。并非出于对他的欲望。好吧，说实话，或许我确实对他有些欲望。只是一点点。但这不是你该担心的。

I kissed him that night for some pastime. And then ever since that happened, I ended up looking at Shinji in a different manner. I'm such an idiot. To think I can get influenced over a bit of fun. Or so I keep saying to myself. Who am I to kid?  
那晚我吻了他，只是为了打发时间。自那以后，我对真嗣的看法就变了。我真是个傻瓜。居然会因为一点乐趣而受到影响。我总是这样对自己说。我算什么，能自欺欺人吗？

Every time I look at Shinji, think of Shinji, hear the name Shinji, I just cant help but think back at the apartment where we kissed for the first time then found we just couldn't stop.  
每次看到真嗣，想到真嗣，听到真嗣的名字，我就不禁回想起我们第一次接吻的那间公寓，然后发现我们根本停不下来。

When I look at him talking to Rei or any other female, I find myself becoming more envious then I really should be and sometimes have the nerve to tell the other girl off regardless of who it was. It should've flared up suspicions that I was so overprotective of Shinji. It did.  
每当看到他和丽或其他女性交谈时，我发现自己变得比应有的更加嫉妒，有时甚至有勇气去责备对方，不管她是谁。我如此过度保护真嗣的行为本应引起怀疑。确实如此。

Before I knew it there were rumours flying around the school, gossip involving me and Shinji and talk of what really happens at Nerve headquarters. I try my best to shrug it off but its really hard for me not to take it so personally when they start saying that I'm going to marry him one day and bear him heaps of children.  
不知不觉间，学校里谣言四起，关于我和真嗣的流言蜚语，还有关于 NERV 总部真实情况的议论。我尽力不去理会，但当他们开始说有一天我会嫁给他，为他生一堆孩子时，真的很难不把这些话放在心上。

Ok, my I DO want to do that but not now. I mean the gossip went so far that I stretched out of the girls boundaries and spread towards the boys and even the teachers. I just hoped that nobody would leak the information to anyone at Nerv.  
好吧，我确实想那样做，但不是现在。我是说，这些八卦传得如此之远，以至于超出了女生的界限，蔓延到了男生甚至老师那里。我只希望没有人会把这些信息泄露给 NERV 的任何人。

Rei seemed like she couldn't careless though. I wondered how she really felt. She was so cut off from the rest of us. It was like she was in her own world, the way she had that air around her to shrug off anything that happens to her. Emotionless, cold, naïve.  
丽似乎毫不在意。我好奇她真正的感受。她与我们其他人如此疏远。她就像活在自己的世界里，那种气场让她能对发生在自己身上的任何事都置之不理。无情感，冷漠，天真。

It made me so angry to see a person like that. Why couldn't they have friends? Why couldn't they be less stupid? Why couldn't they understand and appreciate what life has to offer? I also had trouble shrug off this feeling as this was something that I shouldn't be taking personally. Something that I shouldn't worry about.  
看到这样的人让我非常生气。为什么他们不能有朋友？为什么他们不能不那么愚蠢？为什么他们不能理解和珍惜生活所给予的？我也很难摆脱这种感觉，因为这本不是我应该个人化的，不是我应该担忧的。

Anyway, back to me me me! Never mind Rei.  
总之，回到我我我！别管丽了。

I went back to my endless daydreaming about Shinji. I thought of his lips the most. I dreamed of him kissing me again, of the wars that we waged at home all the time. The competitiveness that ran throughout the apartment like electricity.  
我又回到了对真嗣的无尽白日梦中。我总是想着他的嘴唇。我梦想着他再次吻我，梦想着我们在家里无休止的战争。那种竞争性如同电流般贯穿整个公寓。

But now I associate competition with what goes on inside out mouths, not something trivial but something that has taken a new level of importance in my life. Maybe Shinji's as well…I wouldn't know. All I did know was that I desired another fight, a more satisfying one, longer lasting where I would emerge victorious. This time I wasn't going to lose.  
但现在，我将竞争与发生在口腔内的事情联系起来，不是什么琐事，而是在我生活中占据了新层次重要性的事物。也许对真嗣也是如此……我不清楚。我只知道我渴望另一场战斗，一场更令人满意的、更持久的，我将会胜出的战斗。这次我不会输。

Shinji and I walked home together but in silence. As I thought through my plan of attack, I began to feel that he was staring at me. I tried to ignore it but eventually gave in to curiosity. He immediately looked away but it was so blatantly obvious that he was staring at me. You know when people look away, slightly blushing pretending to be really interested in something that's not important at all? It was like that.  
真嗣和我一起走回家，但一路上沉默不语。当我思考着我的进攻计划时，我开始感觉到他在盯着我。我试图忽视，但最终还是屈服于好奇心。他立刻移开了目光，但那明显到不能再明显了，他就是在盯着我。你知道人们移开视线时，微微脸红，假装对一些根本不重要的事情非常感兴趣的样子吗？就是那样。

I wondered what Shinji thought the night he tried to kiss me another night on the lips. It was excruciatingly embarrassing when our argument was viewed by everyone. I thought about how he looked down my shirt or tried to anyway. I'm not sure how much he saw but I'm positive he wanted to see more.  
我好奇真嗣在那晚试图再次亲吻我嘴唇时是怎么想的。当我们的争吵被所有人看到时，那真是尴尬至极。我想起了他如何低头看向我的衬衫，或者说试图看。我不确定他看到了多少，但我确信他想看到更多。

And the way he reacted when I asked him if my breasts would get any bigger in heat, he just stuttered in his typical manner saying how he wouldn't know. I first thought he was a very boring person indeed but my views on him have changed a lot. All because of that blasted kiss!  
还有当我问他我的胸部在发情期会不会变大时，他只是像往常一样结巴着说他不知道。起初我以为他真是个非常无趣的人，但自从那次该死的吻之后，我对他的看法改变了许多。

When we got back, Misato wasn't around. Since Shinji and I didn't have anything better to do we kissed again.  
当我们回来时，美里不在。由于真嗣和我也没什么更好的事情可做，我们又接吻了。

The way it started off was exactly the same. I was bored and was Shinji. Nobody at home, nothing better to do, nothing we WANTED to do other then kiss again. To fight in an all new manner. To try and dominate. To have discovered new ways to compete.  
事情的开端一如既往。我无聊至极，身边只有真嗣。家里没人，没有更好的事情可做，也没有我们想做的事，除了再次亲吻。以一种全新的方式战斗。试图占据上风。发现了新的竞争方式。

"Bet I can hold my breath longer while I kiss ya!" I said playfully to Shinji who this time accepted my challenge without a seconds thought. We fought on the couch again, the same old arena we used as our previous encounter. Only instead of him lying on top of me, I was lying on top of him.  
“我敢打赌，我能在亲吻时憋气比你更久！”我笑着对真嗣说，这次他毫不犹豫地接受了我的挑战。我们再次在沙发上展开较量，这是我们上次相遇的旧战场。只是这次不再是他在我上面，而是我在他上面。

"Ready?" I said. Shinji nodded and pulled me down. I hardly had the chance to take in some air so this was not going good for me. I broke away impatiently and said "No fair! I wasn't ready!"  
“准备好了吗？”我问道。真嗣点点头，把我拉了下来。我几乎没有机会呼吸，这对我不利。我急切地挣脱开，说：“这不公平！我还没准备好！”

He just laughed and said "How about now?" Seizing the opportunity, I started the fight without giving him a chance. Or so I thought. He seemed to have grabbed some air somehow before I managed to get a grip and block the air flow completely. I was very reluctant to lose and so was he so by the time we stopped, we were both blue, had headaches and panting hard trying to regain our breath.  
他只是笑了笑，问道：“现在怎么样？”我抓住机会，立刻发起攻击，不给他任何喘息的机会。至少我是这么想的。在我能抓住并完全阻断气流之前，他似乎不知怎么地已经抓住了一些空气。我们都不愿意认输，所以当我们停下来时，两人都脸色发青，头痛欲裂，喘着粗气试图恢复呼吸。

"Best out of 3," I panted and Shinji nodded.  
“三局两胜，”我喘着气说，真嗣点了点头。

"But let's have a break first. I feel so dizzy…" he said trying to get up and get a glass of water but collapsed.  
“但先休息一下吧。我感觉头晕……”他试图起身去拿杯水，却瘫倒在地。

I laughed and fell on top of him. I used my elbows to support myself on top of his chest and looked down onto his face, examining when a good time to strike would be.  
我笑着扑倒在他身上。我用肘部撑在他胸口，俯视着他的脸，思索着何时出手最为合适。

Finally I took the lunge as he exhaled and this time I know he didn't get any air as he was like trying to mumble something in my mouth, something like "Get off!" but I was puling him closer to myself that no amount of puling or pushing was going to get me off.  
终于，在他呼气时我抓住了机会，这次我知道他没有吸入任何空气，因为他似乎在我嘴里含糊地咕哝着“放开我！”但我在用力将他拉近，无论他怎么拉扯或推搡，都无法让我松手。

As my tongue went as deep as it could inside his mouth, savouring his taste, he let his go limp implying a sign of defeat.  
当我的舌头尽可能深入他的口腔，品味着他的味道时，他放松了舌头，暗示着投降的迹象。

I let go and he panted for some more air.  
我松开手，他喘着气，又吸了几口空气。

"1 nil," I said smiling at him triumphantly. I was winning now. I wasn't going to lose this time.  
"1 比 0，" 我笑着对他说，得意洋洋。现在我领先了。这次我不会输了。

"Ok, bring it on!" he said after getting some air and pulled me down again for some more. This time he tickled me on my sides, a place where I am very sensitive. I squirmed at first then pulled myself off him laughing.  
"好，来吧！" 他喘过气来后说道，再次把我拉倒。这次他挠我腰侧，那是我非常敏感的地方。我先是扭动了几下，然后笑着挣脱了他。

"Hey, that's cheating!' I said pouting.  
“嘿，这是作弊！”我噘嘴说道。

"No rules Asuka!" he said grinning. I pushed him back down as I renounced the scores. "Loser has to run around the flat naked while the winner gets to invite anybody he wants." Shinji said. I knew Shinji implied _he_ for the reason thinking that he could beat me.  
“没有规则，明日香！”他咧嘴笑着说。我把他推回去，宣布分数无效。“输的人得光着身子绕公寓跑一圈，而赢家可以邀请任何人。”真嗣说。我知道真嗣指的是他自己，因为他认为自己能赢我。

I also knew he would want me to do this. I was all the more determined to win now. I wasn't going to lose. Not with the reputation I have to uphold. What would Hikaru and the others think of me then? But maybe Shinji wouldn't. Maybe.  
我也知道他会希望我这么做。我现在更加决心要赢。我不会输的。我得维护我的名声。如果我输了，光和他们的其他人会怎么想我？但也许真嗣不会。也许。

"I'll tell them about why I'm doing it should I lose then." I stated. This clearly had some weight as Shinji pondered on it.  
"如果我输了，我会告诉他们我这么做的原因。" 我陈述道。这显然有些分量，因为真嗣对此陷入了沉思。

"Done." Shinji said in the end. What? No way would he accept it. I sat on him with shock written all over my face. "Because I can tell them who issued the challenge the other night."  
"成交。" 真嗣最终说道。什么？他不可能接受这个。我震惊地坐在他身上，满脸写着不可思议。"因为我可以告诉他们那晚是谁发起的挑战。"

He had me over the barrel then. "Fine," I grumbled. "Don't chicken out when you lose though Shinji."  
那时他完全占了上风。"好吧，"我咕哝着。"不过真嗣，输了可别临阵退缩。"

"I won't lose." He said in a more cockier tone now. He was intimidating me. I was sure of it.  
"我不会输的。" 他现在用一种更加自负的语气说道。他让我感到害怕。我确信这一点。

Again our lips met that day with near death experiences, it lasted until Misato broke in on our third kiss.  
那天，我们的嘴唇再次相遇，伴随着濒死的体验，直到美里打断了我们的第三次亲吻。

She sat there watching us, laughing and taunting us as we both lay there blushing furiously but not wanting to lose. The score was 2-2 and there was not going to be a rematch.  
她坐在那里看着我们，笑着嘲弄我们，我们俩都躺在那里，脸红得厉害，但都不想认输。比分是 2-2，不会再有重赛了。

We lay there no longer moving our tongues because we were both too tired. In fact I couldn't really tell if Shinji was admitting defeat or if he fell unconscious or if he was still in the game.  
我们就那样躺在那里，不再动舌头，因为我们都太累了。事实上，我真分不清真嗣是承认失败了，还是昏过去了，或者他还在游戏中。

I didn't know what to do. We were at a stalemate now. To let go and check to find Shinji was still awake would be defeat. Falling unconscious would be another way of being defeated.  
我不知道该怎么办。我们现在陷入了僵局。放手去检查真嗣是否还醒着就意味着失败。昏过去则是另一种失败的方式。

In which it was my sad tale of how my reputation went out the roof with Shinji inviting half the class, including Toji, Kensuke, Rei and Hikaru. Laughter exploded throughout the night.  
这就是我那悲惨的故事，我的名声随着真嗣邀请了半个班的人，包括东治、健介、绫波和光，而一落千丈。整个晚上笑声不断。

---
Is it my fault? What did I do wrong? How did I do something wrong? How would I know if I even did something wrong? It wasn't shown clearly, hasn't been stated. I never knew that Shinji was with Asuka. Now I have experienced a new feeling. Guilt. I had no idea at first, I just realised how embarrassed and ashamed I felt, how bad, how I hated the feeling! These past days I have experienced many more feelings than I would like to encounter.  
是我的错吗？我做错了什么？我怎么做错了什么？我怎么知道我是否做错了什么？它没有清楚地显示，没有说明。我从来不知道真嗣和明日香在一起。现在我体验到了一种新的感觉。内疚。起初我不知道，我只是意识到我感到多么尴尬和羞愧，多么糟糕，我多么讨厌这种感觉！在过去的几天里，我所经历的感受比我想遇到的要多得多。

It all started when I made the mistake of asking Shinji. I wouldn't say it's his fault. He felt sorry for me. He told me. To see me like that, alone, to think that life has nothing to offer…it pained him. It did actually pain me. But I hid it. I never showed anybody how I truly ever felt. Only when I was in the privacy of my own apartment did I cry myself to sleep. Would I stay this way all my life? A person who received nothing? Would I remain this way and never understand what human interaction truly was?  
这一切都始于我错误地问真嗣。我不会说这是他的错。他为我感到难过。他告诉我。看到我那样，独自一人，认为生活没有什么可以提供的......这让他很痛苦。这确实让我很痛苦。但我把它藏了起来。我从来没有向任何人展示过我的真实感受。只有当我在自己的公寓里时，我才会哭着睡觉。我会一辈子都这样吗？一个一无所获的人？我会一直这样，永远不明白人际交往到底是什么吗？

Anyway, Shinji and I were sitting on the park bench. The trees danced with the wind in the sweltering heat. I awaited a response from him. I had asked him "What is affection, love and care?" I knew its definition but I have never understood the experience. I wanted to know, to finally become more humane. To become less naïve. But as I spoke those words, I felt my heart wrench, this anguish that I couldn't comprehend. Why did I feel this way when I spoke these few words?  
总之，真嗣和我坐在公园的长椅上。树木在闷热的天气中随风起舞。我等待着他的回应。我曾问过他：“什么是亲情、爱和关怀？我知道它的定义，但我从未理解过这种体验。我想知道，最终变得更加人性化。变得不那么天真。但当我说这些话时，我感到我的心很痛，这种我无法理解的痛苦。为什么我说这几句话时会有这种感觉？

I saw him thinking long and hard. He stared away for a second, while I noticed his features. His short brown hair flowing in the wind just like the trees, his slim build yet such strength he possessed in his frame. He rejects his strength, shows he doesn't want to be an Eva pilot yet in the end, he is one. That's all I'll ever be. Nothing more than a pilot, a _doll_ that has nothing else to live for. Just left over waste when the Angels stop coming.  
我看到他思考了很久很久。他盯着别处看了一会儿，而我注意到了他的特征。他的棕色短发像树木一样在风中飘扬，他苗条的身材却在他的框架中拥有如此的力量。他拒绝自己的力量，表明他不想成为一名伊娃飞行员，但最终，他就是其中之一。这就是我永远的样子。只不过是一个飞行员，一个一无所有活下去的娃娃。当天使停止到来时，只剩下废物。

"Affection, how could I describe it…it has different levels. Its obvious meaning is love and goodwill for another person. I can't really describe it…" he petered out.  
“亲情，我该怎么形容......它有不同的级别。它的明显含义是对另一个人的爱和善意。我真的无法形容......”他渐渐消失了。

"Can't or won't?" I said. I must've seemed like I was pushing him. But I had no idea at the time.  
“不能还是不会？”我说过。我一定是在推他。但我当时并不知道。

"Well, it can be shown through words or actions. Such as saying something like 'I love you,' or actions such as a kiss…"  
“嗯，它可以通过言语或行动表现出来。比如说'我爱你'之类的话，或者像亲吻这样的动作......”

"So, if I was to show you my affection, I would do…this…" I said. I got a hold of his shirt and pulled him towards me as we shared our first kiss together.  
“所以，如果我向你表达我的爱意，我会......这......”我说过。我抓住他的衬衫，把他拉向我，我们一起分享了我们的初吻。

It felt like forever, as though my world had frozen, there was no-one but the two of us. We finally parted, and sat there blushing, unsure of what to do next. It was still a completely new experience for me.  
感觉就像永远一样，仿佛我的世界冻结了，除了我们两个人，没有其他人。我们终于分开了，脸红地坐在那里，不知道下一步该怎么做。这对我来说仍然是一次全新的体验。

That was the part where I screwed up. I don't appreciate this feeling of guilt so I'd rather share the burden with Shinji. Because I didn't initiate the next moment. He cupped my jaw and his hands felt surprisingly firm and he pulled me in for another kiss. He locked his lips onto mine and then somehow managed to pull the two of us onto the soft grass.  
那是我搞砸的部分。我不欣赏这种内疚感，所以我宁愿和真嗣分担负担。因为我没有在下一刻发起。他捏住我的下巴，他的手感觉出奇的坚定，他把我拉进去又吻了一下。他把嘴唇贴在我的嘴唇上，然后不知怎的把我们俩拉到柔软的草地上。

I noticed that he ended up on top, I didn't like being the dominant one so I was happy. It reminded me of the moment when I first met Shinji in my apartment. Only I was clothed this time and his hands were NOT where they shouldn't have been. He was still the extremely timid type back then, but much more bold this time. I was also an introvert type but I had no desire to seek friends. Desire? I would've relished the fact that somebody would've wanted to become my friend. I just couldn't do it myself, I just didn't know how.  
我注意到他最终名列前茅，我不喜欢成为主导者，所以我很高兴。这让我想起了我第一次在公寓里见到真嗣的那一刻。这次只有我穿了衣服，他的手不在不应该的地方。那时的他还是那种极度胆小的类型，但这次大胆多了。我也是一个内向的人，但我不想寻找朋友。欲望？我会喜欢有人想成为我的朋友。我自己做不到，我只是不知道怎么做。

It felt like an hour again, as I stared into the calm of his eyes. We were both breathing heavily. I did something that I didn't expect again, and I pulled him down for another kiss. This time our kissing became more passionate than gentle with our tongues finally becoming involved. I entwined my tongue around his, savouring the taste. My wide open mouth had locked onto his and we kissed away without another though.  
感觉又像一个小时了，我盯着他平静的眼睛。我们俩都呼吸沉重。我又做了一件我没想到的事情，我把他拉下来又吻了一下。这一次，我们的接吻变得比温柔更热情，我们的舌头终于参与进来了。我用舌头缠绕着他，细细品味着它的味道。我张开的大嘴已经锁定了他的嘴，我们接吻了，没有另一个。

His kisses stopped focusing so much on my mouth, becoming more adventurous and he kissed his way down to the side of my neck where he started kissing and sucking on a part of my skin. He was producing a narcotic effect, as my movements gradually began to become more lethargic with his treatment.  
他的吻不再那么集中在我的嘴上，变得更加冒险，他一路吻到我的脖子一侧，在那里他开始亲吻和吮吸我的一部分皮肤。他正在产生麻醉作用，因为我的动作在他的治疗下逐渐开始变得更加昏昏欲睡。

"Shinji…" I moaned. Eventually he stopped and I frowned in disappointment. I had no idea of the mark he left on my skin. I stared up at him, my eyelids were drooping and I felt a blush on my cheeks. Some may have called it an indicator of lust however, either Shinji had no idea or he had extra control over himself as he didn't even show a reaction to it.  
“真嗣......”我呻吟着。最终他停了下来，我失望地皱起了眉头。我不知道他在我皮肤上留下的印记。我抬头盯着他，眼皮下垂，脸颊上泛起了红晕。有些人可能称其为欲望的指标，然而，要么真嗣不知道，要么他对自己有额外的控制权，因为他甚至没有表现出任何反应。

He kissed me lightly on the nose. "Happy now?" Shinji asked.  
他轻轻地吻了吻我的鼻子。“现在开心了吗？”真嗣问道。

I gave a contented sigh but then suddenly I felt as though I wanted more again. I couldn't bring myself to kiss him again and we got up and sat on the bench again. I leaned my head on his shoulder, thinking.  
我心满意足地叹了口气，但突然间，我觉得我又想要更多了。我再也忍不住吻他了，我们站起来，又坐在长凳上。我把头靠在他的肩膀上，想着。

The only positive attention I ever remember accepting was from Gendou. An Ikari just like Shinji but different altogether. It's a no wonder why I am so defensive about him, why I slapped Shinji when he doubted his own fathers work. All because he was the only one who showed any sort of affection should I have understood it. All I knew was that I craved for more of it, wanted to be the only one who ever received it. I finally learnt about jealousy.  
我记得接受的唯一积极的关注来自Gendou。一个和真嗣一样的伊卡里，但完全不同。难怪我对他如此防备，为什么当真嗣怀疑自己父亲的工作时，我打了他一巴掌。这一切都是因为他是唯一一个表现出任何感情的人，我应该理解这一点。我只知道我渴望得到更多，想成为唯一一个收到它的人。我终于学会了嫉妒。

We began to get restless again and before I knew it, I started again, I straddled myself on his lap, my legs hanging out through the back of the bench and bent down to kiss him again. How I could do this I didn't know. I blame it on instinct. One I don't have either.  
我们又开始焦躁不安，不知不觉中，我又开始了，我跨坐在他的腿上，双腿从长凳后面伸出来，弯下腰再次吻他。我不知道我是怎么做到的。我把它归咎于本能。我也没有。

The next thing I knew was hat it was dark. To think during all that time we spent solely on making out! I was shocked, something that didn't happen too often. "Uhhh, Rei? I think we should go now, Asuka'll have a fit if she knows what we've been up to."  
接下来我就知道的是，天黑了。在那段时间里，我们只花在了亲热上！我很震惊，这种情况并不经常发生。“呃，玲？我想我们现在应该走了，如果明日香知道我们在做什么，她会很合适的。

"Mmmm…" I murmured in agreement and got up. I didn't want to leave but he was so blunt about it, it hurt. I walked away into the darkness, feeling as though I left a piece of myself behind. I had no idea that being with him and experiencing something as trivial as that could've made me so happy. I felt that I wanted to be with him more, but what he said made me angry.  
“嗯......”我嘀咕了一句，然后站了起来。我不想离开，但他对此直言不讳，很痛。我走到黑暗中，感觉好像我把自己的一部分抛在了脑后。我不知道和他在一起，经历这样微不足道的事情会让我如此快乐。我觉得我想和他在一起，但他说的话让我很生气。

As I walked home, I was surprised to find an angry Asuka storm out of my flat. She noticed me and instantly came tearing up to see me. "Where's that stupid Shinji! He should've been home already! Where were you two?"  
当我走回家时，我惊讶地发现愤怒的明日香从我的公寓里冲了出来。她注意到了我，立刻哭着来看我。“那个愚蠢的真嗣在哪里！他应该已经回家了！你们俩去哪儿了？

"We were at the park." I stated calmly. It was the truth. Kinda. I just didn't tell her the whole truth. I almost could've gotten away with it too, until she saw the mark on my neck.  
“我们在公园里。”我平静地说。这是事实。金达。我只是没有告诉她全部真相。我几乎也可以逃脱，直到她看到我脖子上的印记。

"Woah woah, you were at the park with _only_ Shinji?" she said. I was surprised by the way her mood suddenly changed. Now it was more fearful.  
“哇哇，你和真嗣一起在公园里？”她说。我惊讶于她的情绪突然发生了变化。现在它更可怕了。

"Yes." “是的。”

Her whole world shattered in front of me and I had no idea about it. She paled and then ran home, shouting curses in German and English, languages that I have no proficiency at.  
她的整个世界在我面前破碎了，我对此一无所知。她脸色苍白，然后跑回家，用德语和英语大声咒骂，这些语言我都不熟练。

I entered my flat, and looked at my familiar surroundings. What would it be like, if Shinji were to be here? No, I didn't want that. I was content with life the way it was. I didn't need him to lighten up my life. It was fine. Try as I might, I my conscience couldn't battle through my heart as I realised what I truly wanted.  
我走进我的公寓，看着我熟悉的环境。如果真嗣在这里会是什么样子？不，我不想那样。我对现在的生活很满意。我不需要他来照亮我的生活。这很好。尽我所能，我的良心无法通过我的心来战斗，因为我意识到我真正想要的是什么。

I went to the bathroom and looked into the mirror to see what Shinji saw in me. 'Red eyes, blue hair, pale white skin…' what was it that made me so attractive? I didn't want to think about it so I quickly brushed off the thought. Then I noticed a slightly darkened part of my skin. Normally, nobody would've noticed it but on my pale skin, it was instantly recognisable. I tried to cover it up as it dawned onto me. 'Was it a hickey?' I blushed and left the room, avoiding reflective surfaces for the rest of the night.  
我去了洗手间，照了照镜子，想看看真嗣在我身上看到了什么。“红眼睛，蓝头发，苍白的皮肤......”是什么让我如此有吸引力？我不想去想它，所以我很快就打消了这个想法。然后我注意到我的皮肤有点黑。通常，没有人会注意到它，但在我苍白的皮肤上，它立即被识别出来。我试图掩盖它，因为它突然出现在我身上。“是打嗝吗？”我脸红了，离开了房间，在晚上剩下的时间里避开了反光的表面。

As I lay on my bed, for the first time in a long time did I not cry.  
当我躺在床上时，很长一段时间以来，我第一次没有哭泣。

a/n: hey, this here is a kind of side story…not really, now there's a PLOT! Hooray! Anyway, it is not meant to be a funny one, ore just showing the sad reality of Rei's life in my POV. So yeah, don't sue me! Disclaimer? Oh, right…  
A/N：嘿，这是一个支线故事......不是真的，现在有一个情节！万岁！无论如何，这并不是一个有趣的故事，或者只是在我的 POV 中展示了 Rei 生活的悲惨现实。所以是的，不要起诉我！免責聲明？哦，对了......

Disclaimer: F YOU!

a/n: Well, it took a hell of a long time to bring this story up-to-date and I doubt anybody continued reading it, considering that it was virtually branded as one of those no-hoper stories, where no update ever comes again. Well, to anyone still interested, I've uploaded a new chapter! Enjoy reading!  
a/n：嗯，花了很长时间才更新这个故事，我怀疑有人会继续阅读它，因为它实际上被标记为那些没有希望的故事之一，从来没有更新过又来了。好吧，对于仍然感兴趣的人，我上传了一个新的 chapter！享受阅读！

Steam rose around me, clouding up my small bathroom. I turned off the taps, and the water stopped flowing. I get in. It's hot. And cramped. Damn this bathtub! I've always wanted a bigger one!  
蒸汽在我周围升起，笼罩了我的小浴室。我关掉水龙头，水就不再流了。我进去了。天气很热。而且很局促。这该死的浴缸！我一直想要一个更大的！

I lay there, relaxing, relieving myself of all the tension that occurred throughout the day. Damn NERV, they hardly pay me what I deserve, for all the things I go through!  
我躺在那里，放松身心，缓解一整天的紧张情绪。该死的NERV，他们几乎没有给我应得的报酬，因为我经历了所有的事情！

Oh well, can't be helped I guess.  
哦，好吧，我想也是没办法。

_Bzzzz 嗡嗡声_

Shit! Brilliant timing. No doubt it would be one of Shinji's friends anyway.  
拉屎！时机绝佳。毫无疑问，无论如何，他都会是真嗣的朋友之一。

'Hey Shinji! Go answer the freakin door!' I shouted. I wasn't prepared to leave this bath tub. Not yet anyway.  
'嘿真嗣！去开门吧！我喊道。我不准备离开这个浴缸。反正还没有。

'Ok.' I here him say quietly. Footsteps go by. I can just imagine Suzuhara's face when Shinji tells him I'm in the bathtub. The lusty eyes, the blushing face, the huge goofy smile…damn perverted 14 year old kids…  
'好的。'我对他轻声说道。脚步声过去。我可以想象当真嗣告诉铃原我在浴缸里时铃原的表情。旺盛的眼神，通红的脸，傻乎乎的笑容……该死的变态14岁孩子……

I hear footsteps running back. Shit! What if Suzuhara is gonna break into the bathroom and have a perve? Oh my God I'll kill him if that happens!  
我听到脚步声跑回来。拉屎！如果铃原要闯进浴室变态怎么办？天哪，如果发生这种情况我会杀了他！

'Um Misato, it's um..Rei,' Shinji says through the door. Anticlimax. Then…what would this have to do with me!?  
“嗯，美里，我是……丽，”真嗣隔着门说道。虎头蛇尾。那……这跟我有什么关系！？

'So why are you telling me?' I answer, suppressing my annoyance. Something tells me this is not going to be a great evening.  
“那你为什么要告诉我？”我强压着心中的烦躁回答道。有件事告诉我这不会是一个美好的夜晚。

'She wants to talk to you.'  
“她想和你谈谈。”

Silence. 安静。

The First Child. The white, achromatic coloured girl, mixed and matched with bright crimson eyes and beryl blue hair. A girl who is 100 dedicated to her work, one without problems, but one without a resolve either.  
第一个孩子。白色、无彩色的少女，与明亮的深红色眼睛和翠绿色的头发混搭在一起。一个对工作百分百奉献的女孩，一个没有问题的女孩，但也没有决心。

Since when would Rei Ayanami want to see me unless it concerned work? This was a bit strange.  
除了工作以外，绫波丽什么时候愿意见我了？这有点奇怪。

'Why?' I ask, anxious to know more.  
'为什么？'我急切地想知道更多。

'She won't tell me.' He replies, then I hear him leave. I sigh and then get out. The steamy air feels like a chill as I get out of the water, and I dry myself quickly and get dressed. 'Hang on,' I call through the door. Pen Pen will no doubt be pleased to go in a little bit earlier.  
“她不会告诉我。”他回答了，然后我听到他离开了。我叹了口气，然后出去了。当我从水里出来时，潮湿的空气感觉很冷，我很快擦干身体并穿好衣服。 “坚持住，”我隔着门喊道。潘潘无疑会很高兴能早一点进去。

I come out and find Rei waiting at the door. It was raining quite moderately, with fairly strong gusts of wind blowing. What is that stupid Shinji doing? And where the hell is he?  
我出来，发现雷在门口等着。雨下得不大，还刮着阵风。那个愚蠢的慎二在做什么？他到底在哪里？

'Oh my God, I'm so sorry about this, Rei. Please come inside.' I invited then 'Where the hell is that stupid Shinji and why the hell didn't he let you in?' I started as I stormed my way over to his room.  
“天哪，我对此感到非常抱歉，丽。请进来。我当时问道：“那个愚蠢的真嗣到底在哪里？他为什么不让你进来？”当我冲向他的房间时，我吃了一惊。

'No it's ok Misato.' Rei's voice called out. I stopped and turned around. This girl really is truly apathetic isn't she? _'Doll'_ I recall somewhere in my mind.  
“不，没关系，美里。”雷伊的声音响起。我停下来转身。这丫头真是冷漠至极不是吗？我在脑海中想起了“娃娃”。

'Um Misato, I was wondering if you could actually help me…' she stopped. And for the first time I saw her blush, and she looked away embarrassed. 'I'd rather not discuss this where Shinji may hear us…'  
“嗯美里，我想知道你是否真的可以帮助我……”她停了下来。我第一次看到她脸红，她尴尬地移开了视线。 “我不想在真嗣可能听到我们的地方讨论这个……”

'_Ok'_ I thought. 'Wait, let me get an umbrella.'  
“好吧”我想。 “等等，我去拿把伞。”

I called out to Shinji that we were going for a walk and then we left the block of apartments. Without hinting at anything, Rei began, blushing slightly heavier than before. Perhaps she **was** more than a doll.  
我对真嗣喊道我们要去散步，然后就离开了公寓楼。雷没有任何暗示，脸色比​​之前更红了，开口说道。也许她不仅仅是一个洋娃娃。

'A couple of days ago,' she began in a timid voice. 'I asked Shinji "What is affection, love and care?". I wanted to know. I lived my entire life without such a strong understanding of what that emotion was. I was virtually alone my entire life. Gendou was the first person I felt any affection to and then along came Shinji and I realized I was beginning to feel confused. Where did this feeling of happiness come from? Why was I feeling it? How come I knew that I was happy? Who decided that I deserved to feel this way?'  
“几天前，”她用胆怯的声音说道。我问真嗣“什么是感情、爱和关怀？”。我想知道。我一生都没有对这种情感有如此深刻的理解。我一生几乎都是孤独的。源道是我第一个感受到感情的人，然后真嗣出现了，我意识到我开始感到困惑。这种幸福感从何而来？为什么我有这种感觉？我怎么知道我很幸福？谁决定我应该有这种感觉？

I looked at her as we continued walking down the empty streets of Tokyo-3. She continued to stare ahead, her face slightly wrenched in pain. I could hear it from her voice, and see it in her eyes. And I could tell I was the first person she was telling of her suffering to.  
当我们继续走在第三东京空荡荡的街道上时，我看着她。她继续盯着前方，脸庞因疼痛而微微扭曲。我可以从她的声音中听出这一点，也可以从她的眼神中看到这一点。我看得出来，我是她第一个诉说她的痛苦的人。

'And then he replied how it could be expressed through actions or words such as "I love you" or a kiss. And before I knew it, I was bringing myself closer to him, and I pulled him towards me to kiss him. And he responded.'  
然后他回答了如何通过行动或言语来表达，例如“我爱你”或一个吻。在我意识到之前，我把自己靠近他，把他拉向我并吻他。他回应了。

And at this stage, she shut her eyes, determined not to cry. I didn't say anything. What was there to say? She gave a small hiccup before continuing.  
而这个时候，她闭上了眼睛，决心不哭。我什么也没说。有什么可说的？她打了个小嗝嗝，然后继续说道。

'And I didn't know he was already with Asuka. I remember him telling me he felt sorry for me. I haven't had anyone speak to me like that before. It was always "Do this" or "Do that". I was just someone…no…some**thing** ordered around to do everyone's bidding. And to think I spent how many years living like that without realizing…but then, to meet Shinji who was almost just like me! I didn't realize anything at first but slowly, I began to realize I felt this 'want' to be with him anywhere. And I didn't know why!'  
“而且我不知道他已经和明日香在一起了。我记得他告诉我他为我感到难过。我以前从来没有人这样对我说过话。总是“做这个”或“做那个”。我只是一个……不……被命令执行每个人命令的人。想想我就这样生活了多少年却没有意识到……但后来，遇见了几乎和我一样的真嗣！起初我什么也没意识到，但慢慢地，我开始意识到我感觉到这种“想要”和他在一起的任何地方。我不知道为什么！

She couldn't hold it back anymore. The pain that had engulfed her within those few moments finally was released as she let her tears flow. She was really crying now. The stoic, emotionless, _doll_ Rei Ayanami was crying. She turned to me.  
她再也忍不住了。刚才那一刻笼罩在她身上的痛苦终于在她的泪水流淌中释放出来。她现在真的哭了。坚忍、没有感情的娃娃绫波丽正在哭泣。她转向我。

'And I loved him! I really did! I wanted to be with him! I wanted him! I would die for him! And I can't have him because of Asuka! He loves her, and he only responded to me because I initiated it!' she cried, eyes wide open, tears leaking out, filled with the belief that Asuka was the only one that had Shinji's heart.  
'我爱他！我真的做到了！我想和他在一起！我想要他！我愿意为他去死！而我却因为明日香而无法拥有他！他爱她，他回应我只是因为我发起的！”她睁大眼睛哭了，眼泪夺眶而出，充满了信念，明日香是唯一俘获真嗣心的人。

I dropped the umbrella. I couldn't bear it. Grabbing her and pressing her into my breast, she wailed loudly under the great black sky. 'Stupid.' I whispered.  
我把伞掉了。我实在无法忍受。她一把抓住她，把她按在我的怀里，在漆黑的天空下放声大哭。 '愚蠢的。'我低声说道。

The poor bewailing thing, sobbing hard, as I pressed her closer, and I felt the pain slowly dawning onto me as well, and the first of many tears began to escape my eyes too.  
当我把她抱得更近时，那个可怜的哀嚎的东西正在抽泣，我也感觉到疼痛慢慢地降临在我身上，许多泪水中的第一滴也开始从我的眼睛里流出来。

'Ssshhh, it's ok,' I cooed, struggling to find the right words that could comfort her.  
“嘘嘘，没关系，”我轻声说道，努力寻找合适的词语来安慰她。

To think we were strangers when we left the building and now I was the most important person to her. I felt like a completely useless person, one that is supposed to help and comfort when the other needs you the most but cannot. What good am I, if I can't even help the Eva pilots when they need me the most? What am I doing, giving strings of orders to the pilots who depend on me, when I can't help them now? _'I'm a failure'_ I thought as I clutched onto the frail body of hers.  
当我们离开大楼时，我们是陌生人，而现在我对她来说是最重要的人。我觉得自己像一个完全无用的人，一个应该在对方最需要你却不能的时候提供帮助和安慰的人。如果在 Eva 飞行员最需要我的时候我都帮不了他们，那我还有什么用呢？当我现在无法帮助依赖我的飞行员时，我在做什么？ “我是个失败者”，我一边想，一边抓住她虚弱的身体。

Rain continued to pour, soaking the two of us. The water falling from the sky, disguised our tears, little clear sparkles, dripping off our chins, and onto each other.  
雨继续下着，把我们两个人淋湿了。水从天而降，掩盖了我们的泪水，清澈的小火花，从我们的下巴滴落到彼此身上。

Finally, I couldn't take the cold anymore and said 'Come on Rei, let's take you home.'  
最后，我再也受不了寒冷了，说道：“来吧，丽，我们送你回家吧。”

Still sniveling, she wiped at one of her eyes and nodded. I bent down to reach for the umbrella, and holding her close, we walked to her apartment in silence.  
她仍然抽泣着，擦了擦一只眼睛，点了点头。我弯下腰去拿伞，紧紧地抱着她，我们默默地向她的公寓走去。

Seeing Rei cry was one thing, but seeing her living conditions was bordering horrendous. And I already thought that making Rei cry was pretty much as bad as it was going to get.  
看到丽哭泣是一回事，但看到她的生活条件却近乎可怕。而且我已经认为让丽哭泣几乎是最糟糕的事情。

How did our very corporation allow our most important and valued asset live in such a terrible shabby little apartment? Beyond valued…_priceless_. Surely we could have placed her in a more hygienic place. Without her, the Eva wouldn't even do our bidding. And to think Gendou really cared for her.  
我们公司怎么能让我们最重要、最有价值的资产住在这么破旧的小公寓里？超越价值……无价。我们当然可以把她安置在一个更卫生的地方。没有她，伊娃甚至不会执行我们的命令。想想源斗真的很关心她。

I noticed that I was staring at her apartment a little too obviously, but she remained silent. It was my turn to blush now.  
我注意到我盯着她的公寓看的有点太明显了，但她却保持沉默。现在轮到我脸红了。

'Take a bath Rei. You should get out of those wet clothes now. I'll try and cook up something warm…'  
「雷，洗澡吧。」你现在应该脱掉那些湿衣服。我会试着煮点热的东西……”

That sounded like it was on the verge of an order. My worry for her, mixed with my embarrassment for myself, led me to forget my place for an instant. _Damn you stupid Misato!_  
听起来像是即将下达命令。我对她的担心，加上对自己的尴尬，让我一瞬间忘记了自己的位置。妈的，美里你这个蠢货！

Then it struck me. What was I supposed to cook anyway? Rei was vegetarian right? Spicy vegetarian curry didn't seem like the way to go at this very moment. Coming to think of it, she probably wouldn't have curry in this place anyway.  
然后我震惊了。无论如何，我应该煮什么？丽是素食主义者吧？辣味素食咖喱此时此刻似乎不适合。想想看，她这个地方大概也不会吃咖喱吧。

I heard the taps turn on and the water start pouring, while I raided her cupboards in search of anything. She had a really plain lifestyle. What did she eat?!  
我听到水龙头打开，水开始倾泻而下，同时我搜查了她的橱柜寻找任何东西。她的生活方式非常朴素。她吃了什么？！

Now I was well and truly shivering. I wouldn't mind taking a shower myself, but then what am I supposed to change into? My clothes were soaking wet. At least if I were to get pneumonia or something, I could have a cruel reminder of the humanity I still had within me. I'm still not a bitch yet. Unless it's with Kaji when he's acting childish. Damn him!  
现在我真的浑身发抖了。我不介意自己洗澡，但那我该换什么衣服呢？我的衣服都湿透了。至少，如果我得了肺炎什么的，我可以残酷地提醒我内心仍然存在人性。我还不是个婊子。除非是和加持一起表现得很幼稚。该死的他！

The water stops. Rei walked out of her bathroom, drying herself with this boring old brown towel. Has she no shame? Yet, she doesn't even look at me. I just looked away and mumbled something about not being able to find anything to cook up. She took no notice.  
水停了。丽走出浴室，用这条乏味的旧棕色毛巾擦干身体。她就没有羞耻心吗？然而，她连看都不看我一眼。我只是移开视线，嘟囔着什么找不到可以做饭的东西。她没有注意到。

Finally she was dressed. Then there was an awkward silence.  
她终于穿好了衣服。然后是一阵尴尬的沉默。

I stared around the room, shivering a little, wondering what I could do in order to warm up seeing as how none of Rei's clothes would fit me.  
我环顾房间，有点发抖，想知道我能做些什么来暖和起来，因为丽的衣服都不适合我。

The grey-brown walls blended with the scummy floor. Rubbish lay around, and pills lay on top of the fridge. Socks hung above her bed, and other various pieces of underwear lay on her bed.  
灰棕色的墙壁与肮脏的地板融为一体。垃圾散落一地，药片散落在冰箱顶上。床上方挂着袜子，床上还放着各种内衣。

'Misato,' she broke the silence.  
“美里。”她打破了沉默。

'Yeah?' I answered, beginning to shiver uncontrollably now.  
'是的？'我回答道，现在开始无法控制地颤抖。

'How would I apologise to Asuka?'  
“我该如何向明日香道歉呢？”

I fumbled and was about to give her my phone, then decided against it and said 'Don't bother. Let Shinji work out who he truly wants, and then we'll decide how you should apologise.'  
我摸索着，正想把手机给她，但后来决定不给她，并说：“别麻烦了。”让真嗣弄清楚他真正想要的是谁，然后我们再决定你应该如何道歉。

'Ok.' She responded. Then after a pause, she finished with 'Thank you Misato.'  
'好的。'她回应道。停顿了一下，她最后说了句“谢谢美里”。

Then after a longer pause, I smiled and said 'It's ok Rei.' To which tears began to flow from her eyes again, but she did not break down again. Then, for the first time ever, she smiled back at me.  
停顿了较长时间后，我微笑着说：“没关系，丽。”泪水再次从她的眼中流淌出来，但她并没有再次崩溃。然后，她有史以来第一次对我微笑。

I still believe it's a miracle, what effect hope can have on anybody.  
我仍然相信这是一个奇迹，希望可以对任何人产生什么样的影响。

A/n: well, this will be the final chapter I think. I'll leave the story hanging here as I doubt I will continue on with it. But if you wish, keep your hopes up! As I may have some brand new idea that I can reintroduce into the story.  
A/n：嗯，我认为这将是最终的chapter。我会把这个故事留在这里，因为我怀疑我是否会继续讲下去。但如果你愿意，就抱有希望吧！因为我可能有一些全新的想法可以重新引入到故事中。

Originally planned as some one-shot light humour fic, it quickly spiraled into something else. I just couldn't bring myself to write humour about Rei, since it is so exceedingly difficult to bring her out of reality in such a fic where I wanted to keep it as real as possible. Bending enough rules of her character already (and perhaps the others too) I refused to keep it as a humour story. It also wouldn't be complete without the mention of her at all, seeing as she is such a powerful character, so I changed the story into something I used to do best. So there's just an explanation into how I wrote it and why it has fallen from a once humour planned fic into a more angst-styled one. Hope nobody is too disappointed.  
最初计划是一部一次性的轻松幽默小说，但它很快就变成了其他东西。我只是无法让自己写出关于丽的幽默，因为在这样一部我想尽可能保持真实的小说中将她从现实中带出来是非常困难的。已经改变了她角色的足够规则（也许还有其他人），我拒绝将其保留为幽默故事。如果没有提到她，这个故事就不完整，因为她是一个如此强大的角色，所以我把这个故事改成了我以前最擅长的。所以这里只是解释一下我是如何写它的，以及为什么它从一部曾经幽默的小说变成了一部更加焦虑的小说。希望没有人太失望。

If there's something here somebody is unhappy about, then just let me know in a review or whatever. It's been a long time since I wrote anything so I wouldn't except my writing skill to be anywhere near what it was like a few years ago. Thank you to anybody still reading this. silence  
如果有人对此不满意，请通过评论或其他方式告诉我。我已经很久没有写过任何东西了，所以除了我的写作技巧之外，我不会再接近几年前的水平了。感谢仍在阅读本文的任何人。安静

Now as for the disclaimer…hehe…you're not getting one!  
现在至于免责声明……呵呵……你没有得到！

[Bogd0g](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/15426170/Bogd0g): This is how you write a fic! Bravissimo. This my friends; Is how you write a story! Bravo to you my frien. To the details; How each chapter it is entitled to one mind. First was Shinji's, Second was Asuka's and so on. Not promised to one mind for the whole story and not mixed. You write very well. I commend you, This is one of the best fics I've read.
这就是写同人文的方式！太棒了。朋友们，这就是写故事的典范！向你致敬，我的朋友。太棒了。细节处理得很好；每个chapter都有其专属的视角。首先是真嗣的，其次是明日香的，以此类推。并非整个故事都固定一个视角，也没有混淆。你写得非常好。我向你表示赞赏，这是我读过的最佳同人文之一。

narsil750: WAH? don't get me wrong, this is really good, but you can't tell shinji's intentions. is he cheating on asuka, is he with rei, what part will that hickey play. rei's last line was also kind of sad, so i give you credit as an angst writer. well done, update soon.  
什么？别误会，这真的很棒，但你无法判断真嗣的意图。他在对明日香不忠吗，他和丽在一起吗，那个吻痕会起什么作用。丽的最后一句话也有点悲伤，所以我承认你作为一位写悲伤故事的作者很出色。做得好，期待更新。

[Rabbid](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/739053/Rabbid): well i liked it, except for one thing. we all know asuka-unpredictable (in her own way) unstable, crazy (eventally), always casting shinji down, and always sure what she does is right until told otherwise... so wouldnt she just be like "hey shinji-lets go make out!" i know that would suck as a story line-but i think its more like her to say stuff like that, ya know?  
我觉得挺好的，除了一个小问题。我们都知道明日香——难以预测（以她自己的方式），不稳定，疯狂（最终），总是打击真嗣，而且总是确信自己是对的，除非有人告诉她不是这样...所以她会不会直接说“嘿，真嗣——我们去亲热一下吧！”我知道这作为故事情节会很糟糕，但我觉得她更有可能说这种话，你懂的吧？

Sivert:
Nice story. Yeah I agree with others that it's been a while since there was a good A/S fic.  
故事很棒。是的，我同意其他人的看法，已经很久没有看到好的 A/S 同人文了。  
  
One thing I can't understand. She said her grades are worse becouse she can't stop thinking about Shinji but hey. From text I understan it's next day so how can she lower her grades in one day / few hours ?  
有一件事我无法理解。她说她的成绩变差是因为她无法停止想念真嗣，但是根据文本，这是第二天了，她怎么可能在一天之内/几个小时内就降低了成绩呢？  
  
Anyway good story. Keep it up !  
总之，故事很不错。继续加油！
