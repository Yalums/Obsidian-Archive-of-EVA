[September's Nobara](https://fanfiction.net/u/1142108/)  

Author's Notes: Originally, this was to be a songfic, but apparently, songfics aren't permitted, so the next best thing to having the lyrics here in the content, would be having someone listen to the song while reading it: the song is: "Don't Go Away", by the band "Oasis". Speaking of music, the title of this fiction is a play on the song "Komm, Susser Tod/Come, Sweet Death" from Evangelion.  
作者的话：最初，这本打算写成一首歌的同人文，但显然，歌曲同人文是不被允许的，所以，在内容中加入歌词的次佳方式，就是让读者在阅读时听这首歌：这首歌是：“别走开”，由乐队“绿洲”演唱。说到音乐，这篇同人的标题是对《新世纪福音战士》中的歌曲“Komm, Susser Tod/来吧，甜蜜的死亡”的一种戏仿。

Warnings/Misc.: Possible Out Of Character behavior, since this _is_ about four of the characters as older men and women; oh, my goodness, I think I just wrote semi-canon; someone, take said cannon, and threaten me with it possibly hitting me (not the cannon ball, but the cannon itself). Please excuse the horrible cannon/canon pun-I'm bad like that. Additionally, if you spot an error in format, please alert me via messaging, not a review; thank you!  
警告/杂项：可能出现角色性格偏离，因为这是关于四位角色作为中老年男女的故事；哦，天哪，我觉得我写出了半官方设定；谁来拿走那门大炮，用它来威胁我，可能会打到我（不是炮弹，而是大炮本身）。请原谅那个糟糕的大炮/官方双关语——我就是这么坏。另外，如果您发现格式错误，请通过私信而非评论告知我；谢谢！

I wake up to the scent of warm chocolate, the aroma wafting in from the kitchen to entice me to enter the conscious world. Not yet ready, I shift to the right, nuzzling into the other side of the pillow, into warmth, _more, thanks,_ consequently getting half a face full of my own hair, even though I _know_ I got it trimmed recently. Blowing the few auburn strands away from my face, I remain in bed, eyes closed, _what had I dreamed about?_ I frown into the pillow; this _isn't_ how it's supposed to be; _stupid memory, or lack of it, I don't know... hmph;_ idiotin.  
我在温暖的巧克力香味中醒来，香气从厨房飘来，引诱我进入清醒的世界。还未准备好，我向右翻身，将脸埋进枕头的另一侧，寻找更多的温暖，结果半张脸埋进了自己最近才修剪过的头发里。我吹开脸上的几缕赤褐色发丝，依然躺在床上，闭着眼睛，我梦见了什么？我皱着眉头埋进枕头；这不应该是这样的；愚蠢的记忆，或是缺乏记忆，我不知道...哼；傻瓜。

Sighing again, _no, I'm not admitting defeat, I'm just getting up,_ I push the blue flower and striped comforter of the futon away, around my waist, poking and fumbling around with my fingers for my slippers-_no, not there, jeez, where'd I leave 'em...? Not there, either, mmph... It feels like there's dust here... when was the last time we cleaned...? Eh, what_ is that?! I feel my hand recoil, flexing the muscles in my fingers as they curl, like the English sign language letter for "E". _Who left a bowl of instant ramen here?_ Shaking the nearly frozen-over broth from my fingertips, quick little drops falling from my hands, I suppose (still haven't pried my own eyelids open, here), I drag the back of my hand across the floor, attempting to dry it. _Eh?_ This time, not in slightly mortified disgust, but surprise; I find fuzz, and the well-worn indentation of several months' long wear, of shuffling about in the early morning or late evening.  
再次叹息，不，我不是认输，我只是站起来，我推开那蓝花条纹的蒲团被，在腰间摸索着找我的拖鞋——不，不在那儿，哎呀，我放哪儿了……？也不在那儿，嗯……感觉这里有灰尘……我们上次打扫是什么时候了……？咦，那是什么？！我感到手一缩，手指弯曲，像英式手语中的字母'E'。谁把一碗方便面放在这儿了？我摇晃着几乎冻住的汤汁，小水滴从手上快速滴落，我想（还没睁开自己的眼皮呢），我用手的后背擦过地板，试图把它弄干。咦？这次，不是略带尴尬的厌恶，而是惊讶；我发现了一些绒毛，还有几个月来磨损的痕迹，在清晨或深夜里来回走动的痕迹。

"Are you up, yet?" A voice calls-curious, light, _amused_, even-and I remember, _yeah, still here,_ a slight tensing of my muscles, breath catching in the back of my throat-though, I'd never admit that to _him_, of course.  
"你起来了吗？"一个声音问道——好奇、轻松、甚至带着笑意——我记起来了，是的，我还在这里，肌肉微微紧绷，呼吸在喉咙后部卡住——尽管，我当然永远不会向他承认这一点。

It's only as I recall how to work my lungs that I realize something else: how cold it is, and me just pushing my slippers onto my feet, _of course it'd be cold,_ I think, in a self-mocking tone, _it's just a few more days until December, after all-are you_ stupid?  
直到我回想起如何呼吸，才意识到另一件事：这里有多冷，而我只是匆匆穿上拖鞋，当然会觉得冷，我自嘲地想，毕竟离十二月只剩几天了——你是不是傻？

_"Don't talk to yourself like that,"_ he'd told me once, early on in the "arrangement"-that's what I used to call it, back then: The Arrangement. _"You'll start believing it, after a while."_ He'd smiled then, when such an act was rare, was a chore, even, to get out of him; a real smile, not one fueled by guilt, or a 'well, what can you do?' smile. Rare, reality. I force myself to stand on my own two feet, a small, self-depreciating smile hugging my lips as my mind lingers on that memory, trying to preserve, as it always did, the tone he'd used, how I'd _really_ been feeling that day, what we'd been talking about before the verbal boost of, of... _confidence_ I'd received from him; some of the shallow things, too, surface to the front as I fold up the futon, tucking it away: I'd thought he'd spent too long at the store-I'd been busy at the school, so, how could I have judged time, myself? I'd been so sure then, when it was still important to get the last, defeating word in, but now, it's so... I don't know-_trivial_, considering what he does for a living, after all.  
“别那样自言自语，”他曾在一开始，我称之为“安排”的时期这样告诉我，“久而久之，你会开始相信的。”那时，他露出微笑，这种表情难得一见，甚至对他来说是一种负担；那是一个真心的微笑，并非出于内疚，或是那种“还能怎么办”的苦笑。稀有，真实。我强迫自己站稳脚跟，嘴角挂着一丝自嘲的微笑，脑海中回想着那段记忆，试图保留他当时的语气，那天我真实的感受，以及在那次言语上的鼓励——我从他那里得到的信心——之前我们谈论的内容；一些琐碎的事情，随着我折叠起蒲团，将其收好，也浮现在心头：我曾以为他在店里待得太久——我当时忙于学校事务，又怎能准确判断时间呢？那时我如此确信，总想在争论中占上风，但现在看来，考虑到他的职业，这一切显得如此……我不知道——微不足道。

_Space Cowboy,_ that's what I used to call him; I don't remember where-or when-exactly, I picked up that term. I'd laugh _at_ him-never with him, since his laugh seemed so weak, killed before it even knows life-whenever I used it, teasing, as I always did, when he went off to training... and to see her.  
太空牛仔，我以前这么叫他；我不记得具体在哪里或什么时候，我捡起了这个称呼。每当我用它取笑他——总是取笑他，因为他的笑声似乎那么微弱，还未体验过生命就已消逝——我都会笑他，从未与他一同笑过，每当他去训练……以及去见她时。

---

_"So, Space Cowboy's returned," I said, sarcastically, standing up from the small couch. He pulled off his shoes, slipping them into the shelves near the door, smiling a little at me. "Aren't you going to_ say _anything?" I asked him, hands on hips,_ how dare he leave me alone for so long, _waiting for his-probably pathetic-excuse. "Well?"_  
“这么说，太空牛仔回来了，”我讽刺地说道，从那张小沙发上站起来。他脱下鞋子，把它们塞进门边的架子里，对我微微一笑。“你就不想说点什么吗？”我双手叉腰问他，他怎么敢让我独自等这么久，等待他那可能很可怜的借口。“嗯？”

_"I saw Rei today," he said, a neutral expression on his face. "At work. She looks better than last week." ' ...Not that you'd know,' I'm sure he was thinking.  
“我今天见到零了，”他脸上带着中性的表情说。“在工作中。她看起来比上周好。”'……你又怎么会知道呢，'我确信他心里是这么想的。_

_Of course; he visited her every day, and last week, he'd called my classroom from the  
当然；他每天都去看她，上周，他还从_

_headquarters, sounding enthusiastic for the first time in months since our arrangement.  
总部打来电话，自从我们安排以来，几个月来第一次听起来如此兴奋。_

_"You have to come," he'd said, "she's opened her eyes, finally, and I think, soon, she'll be talking again."  
"你必须来，"他说，"她终于睁开了眼睛，我想，很快她就能再次说话了。"_

_"I'm busy," I said, but really, I lied to him; it was just a short assignment, with some late papers in the mix to grade, and it was a weekend, my students wouldn't miss them by any means... well, maybe one or two, they tried so hard... but that was beside the point. "And besides," I said, "I'm here and alive. I'll still be that way when you get back."  
"我很忙，"我说，但实际上，我在对他撒谎；这只是一项简短的任务，还有一些迟交的论文要批改，而且正值周末，我的学生们无论如何都不会错过它们...嗯，也许有一两个，他们非常努力...但这不是重点。"再说，"我说，"我在这里，还活着。你回来时我还是这样。"_

_"Fine," he said, his voice similar to my brittle, cold tone, only not as indignant. "I'll see you when I get home."  
"好吧，"他说，他的声音和我那脆弱、冷淡的语气相似，只是没有那么愤慨。"我回家时再见。"_

_Click, and a long series of buzzes.  
咔哒一声，接着是一连串的嗡嗡声。_

_Now, a week later from that incident-you'd think wonder girl's god incarnate, the way he  
如今，距离那次事件已过去一周——你会以为他是奇迹女孩的神之化身，看他_

_spends so much time at work-I'm waiting, done with grading those papers. I'm just glancing at my diploma for teaching, hung haphazardly next to the one I received at fourteen, when he starts to speak again, walking into the main room.  
工作如此投入——我正在等待，已经批改完那些试卷。我只是不经意地瞥了一眼我的教师资格证书，它随意地挂在我十四岁时获得的证书旁边，这时他又开始说话，走进了主房间。_

_"I saw Rei again today, she looks better than last week-"  
“我今天又见到了零，她看起来比上周好多了——”_

_I don't hear anything after that, just a dull noise, sounds like talking, but it's not. Funny  
之后我什么也听不见了，只有一种沉闷的噪音，听起来像是在说话，但又不是。真有趣。_

_how, in his native language, "Rei" is one of the words that mean "zero", yet, he speaks about her as if she's an angel-what sort of angel'd be bedridden at this time, anyway?  
在他的母语中，“Rei”是表示“零”的词汇之一，然而，他谈起她时却仿佛她是天使——什么样的天使会在此时卧床不起呢？_

_"You remind me of your father," I say softly, as if it makes no difference who he resembles with his work ethic. I don't hear anything, even the buzz I've come to call his talking.  
“你让我想起了你的父亲，”我轻声说道，仿佛他像谁工作都无所谓。我什么也没听见，甚至连我称之为他谈话的嗡嗡声也没有。_

_"I..." he says, after a moment, "I guess... you're right." He turns to face me, I see, from the corner of my eye. Smiling again; he looks so pathetic like that, with a meaningless expression on his face.  
"我..." 他过了一会儿说，"我想... 你说得对。" 他转过身来面对我，我从眼角瞥见。他又笑了；他那样看起来真可怜，脸上带着一种毫无意义的表情。_

_I notice my arms are shaking a bit, how am I right, anyway?  
我发现我的手臂在微微颤抖，我到底哪里对了？_

_"Idiots," I mutter, feeling something on my face, wet, like rain, and heat is making its way around my form. "We're both..." I clench my hands into fists, nails I've been absently picking at, so they're jagged, pressing into my palms; will I start bleeding from that, if I press hard enough?  
"傻瓜，" 我低声说，感觉到脸上有什么东西，湿湿的，像雨水，而热量正从我身上蔓延开来。"我们俩都是..." 我握紧拳头，指甲我一直无意识地抠着，变得参差不齐，压在手掌上；如果我用力按，会不会开始流血？_

_"Don't talk to yourself like that, Sohryu," he says, hesitant, shuffling footsteps toward me. "You'll start to believe it after a while." His hand reaches up, brushes the liquid away from my face, my eyes, and he smiles as he tilts his head.  
"别那样对自己说话，惣流，" 他说道，语气迟疑，脚步蹒跚地向我走来。"久而久之，你会开始相信的。" 他的手伸上来，擦去我脸上的液体，我的眼睛，他歪着头微笑。_

_I know he's just been making the best of a situation, but... I can't... I can't help it. More  
我知道他只是在尽力应对这种情况，但是...我做不到...我控制不住。更多_

_liquid from my eyes, bittersweet and just nearly as comforting as the arms he's placed around me, letting this warmth of his shirt envelope me, supporting my hands in a search for something to hold on to. "It's Asuka," I mutter, though, from the way his arms tighten around me, I know he heard; is he smiling? "Ikari..._Shinji_...call me that from now on: 'Asuka' ...please."_  
泪水从我的眼中流出，苦乐参半，几乎和他环绕我的手臂一样令人安慰，让他的衬衫温暖包裹着我，支撑着我的手寻找可以抓住的东西。"我是明日香，" 我喃喃自语，然而，从他手臂紧抱我的力度来看，我知道他听到了；他在微笑吗？"碇...真嗣...从今往后叫我'明日香'吧...拜托了。

"Sorry about the ramen," he says, grinning in a self-depreciating, apologetic way,though, it doesn't make me as angry as it used to. I say nothing for the moment, leaning against the counter; the incident with the bowl of ramen wasn't quite enough to wake me. "Here," he says, a warm cup of coffee, or maybe hot chocolate, is held out to me, the steam tickling my nose-oh, okay, it's hot chocolate-"enjoy."  
“抱歉，关于那碗拉面，”他说道，带着自嘲和歉意的笑容，尽管这不再像以前那样让我生气了。我一时无言，靠在柜台上；那碗拉面的事故还不足以唤醒我。“给，”他说着，递给我一杯温热的咖啡，或者是热巧克力，蒸汽轻抚我的鼻尖——哦，好吧，是热巧克力——“请享用。”

I think I murmur a "Thanks," to him, and huddle myself over the warm, porcelain mug, blowing gently into the liquid, watching as the half-melted miniature marshmallows swirl languidly around, and the heat caresses my face, while the scent seduces my nose, and I sip at it,  
我想我对他低声说了句“谢谢”，然后蜷缩在温暖的瓷杯前，轻轻向液体吹气，看着半融化的迷你棉花糖慵懒地旋转，热气轻抚我的脸庞，香气诱惑着我的鼻子，我小口啜饮着，

remembering the first time either of us tried being domestic...  
回忆起我们第一次尝试过居家生活的情景……

"Remember the last time we tried to make this, about a year ago?"  
"还记得我们上次尝试做这个，大约是一年前的事吗？"

I look up, a half-smile on my face. "Yeah. It burned my tongue so badly, I thought I'd have to hook myself up to an intravenous drip."  
我抬头，脸上挂着半笑。“是啊。那次烫得我舌头都快熟了，我还以为得给自己挂个点滴呢。”

He laughs. "Same here." He glances at the small calendar magnetically attached to the refrigerator, tilting his head to see. "Hey, your birthday's coming up."  
他笑了。“我也是。”他瞥了一眼冰箱上磁吸的小日历，歪着头看。“嘿，你生日快到了。”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Anything you want?" "你想要什么吗？"

"I..." _Wait._ I check the calendar, grabbing it, the magnet popping off, clattering to the floor. "What about your launch? It was supposed to start..." _today._ "What are you doing here, anyway?"  
"我……" 等等。我抓起日历，磁铁啪的一声脱落，掉到地上。"你的发布会呢？不是应该……" 今天开始。"你到底在这里做什么？"

"Your birthday's coming up in about a week or so," he says by way of explanation. "Is there anything you'd like to do?"  
"你的生日大概还有一周就到了，" 他以此解释道，"有什么特别想做的事吗？"

_Anything I'd like to do?_ "Yes," I say after a moment, "there is."  
我想做的事情？“是的，”我停顿了一下说，“有的。”

I hold the small bouquets of flowers, one from him, the other for her. Hastily, I fill out a card, the occasional stops, bumps, and other impediments of driving causing my handwriting to appear more than a little illegible.  
我手里拿着两束小花，一束是他的，另一束是给她的。匆忙中，我填写了一张卡片，偶尔的停车、颠簸和其他驾驶障碍让我的字迹显得相当难以辨认。

"Thank you," he says, glancing over at me.  
“谢谢，”他看向我，说道。

"I'm not doing this for you," I say lightly. "It's _my_ birthday, after all."  
"我不是为了你才这么做的，"我轻描淡写地说，"毕竟今天是我生日。"

"I know, but still," he says, patting my shoulder, "I want to thank you... for coming to visit her with me."  
"我知道，但还是，"他说着，拍了拍我的肩膀，"我想感谢你……陪我一起来看她。"

"Welcome," I say, attempting to lick the sealing edge of the envelope.  
"不客气，"我说着，试图舔湿信封的封口。"

"Miss Ayanami? You have some visitors," I hear the nurse murmur to the girl on the other side of the door.  
"绫波小姐？你有访客了，"我听到护士在门那边对女孩低声说道。

"Shin...ji?" Weak syllables, threaded-lace thin voice.  
"真...嗣？"微弱的音节，细如绣花线般的声音。

"Is she alright...?" I ask the nurse skeptically.  
"她还好吗...？"我怀疑地问护士。

"Yes, she's just a bit tired from the operation, that's all," says the nurse, ushering us into the hospital room.  
"是的，她只是手术后有点累，仅此而已。"护士说着，领我们进入病房。

"'Operation'?" I ask Shinji, curiosity curling around my mind.  
"手术？"我问真嗣，好奇心在脑海中盘旋。

"She was hurt, earlier-she was ran into by a car," he says, at my arched eyebrow, "and, later, she decided to get an additional operation..." he reddens a bit, _why?_ "about... eleven months ago."  
"她之前受了伤，被车撞了，"他看到我扬起的眉毛后解释道，"然后，她后来决定再做一次手术……"他脸颊微红，为什么呢？"大约是……十一个月前。"

What did he mean, 'operation'? Why's he blushing?  
他说的'手术'是什么意思？为什么他脸红了？

"Shinji..." her voice reached his and my ears. "Asuka... hello."  
"真嗣..." 她的声音传到了他和我的耳中。"明日香...你好。"

"Hey, there, Rei," I murmur, sitting on one of the provided folding chairs. "You okay?" _What a stupid question; she's almost covered in bandages, head to toe._  
"嘿，绫波，"我低声说着，坐在提供的折叠椅上。"你还好吗？" 多么愚蠢的问题；她几乎全身都缠着绷带，从头到脚。

"Yes... thank you for asking, yoursel-" she's interrupted by herself, coughing fit overtaking, shaking, her frame.  
"是的...谢谢你的关心，你自——"她被自己的一阵咳嗽打断，身体颤抖着。

"We're okay," Shinji says, handing a cup of water to Rei. "Why don't you tell Asuka the good news?"  
我们没事，"真嗣说着，递给绫波一杯水。"你为什么不告诉明日香好消息呢？

She looks at us, a very slight curve of her lips resembling a smile as she opens her mouth, when the door opens again, and all three of our heads turn to face the interrupting individual.  
她看着我们，嘴角微微上扬，仿佛在微笑，正要开口，这时门再次打开，我们三人的目光都转向了那个打断我们的人。

"Miss Ayanami," the nurse from before says, a bundle occupying her arms. "She's beautiful," the nurse hands the bundle gingerly to Rei. "He, though, should be here soon; he's only in shock." the nurse laughs a bit.  
"绫波小姐，"之前的那位护士说道，怀里抱着一个包裹。"她真漂亮，"护士小心翼翼地将包裹递给绫波。"至于他，应该很快就会到了；他只是受到了惊吓。"护士轻声笑道。

"'He'?" I ask, raising an eyebrow at Rei and Shinji.  
"“他？”我问道，向绫波和真嗣挑了挑眉。

"Funny," Shinji murmurs, "I never imagined him to be squeamish about this sort of stuff."  
"真有趣，"真嗣低声说，"我从没想过他会对这种事情感到害怕。"

"Who are you talking about?" I ask, my impatience and curiosity getting to me.  
"你在说谁？" 我问道，不耐烦和好奇心让我按捺不住。

"Sorry about that, Rei," a gentle voice comes from behind the door the nurse has just entered.  
"抱歉，Rei，" 一个温柔的声音从护士刚进入的门后传来。

"W-what's he doing here?" I ask, pointing to the young, white-haired, red-eyed man behind us.  
"他...他怎么会在这里？" 我指着我们身后那位年轻、白发红眼的男子问道。

"Asuka, Shinji, good to see you both." Kaworu says, a small grin forming on his face as he takes a seat on Rei's hospital bed. "As well as _you_, Rei," he laughs lightly at this last sentence.  
"明日香，真嗣，很高兴见到你们俩。" 薰说着，脸上露出一丝微笑，他在零的病床上坐下。"还有你，零，" 他轻笑着补充了最后一句。

"You, as well."Rei murmurs, her voice directed at Kaworu, but her eyes on the small, now-cooing, bundle in her arms.  
"你也是。" 零低声回应，她的声音是向着薰的，但她的目光却落在了怀中那个现在正咿咿呀呀的小包裹上。

"Wait a moment," I whisper to Shinji, "Wonder Gir-er, Rei, and Kaworu are...?"  
"等一下，" 我轻声对真嗣说，"奇迹女孩——呃，零和薰他们...？"

"Married, yes, Asuka," Kaworu informs, another small smile hugs his face, "not unlike you two. We're parents, now, too."  
"结婚了，是的，明日香，" 渚薰带着淡淡的微笑说道，"就像你们俩一样。我们现在也是父母了。

"Well, er, congrats, I guess-I mean, of course..." I stammer, still a bit flustered at Kaworu's noticing my side conversation.  
"呃，那个，恭喜吧，我想——我是说，当然……" 我结结巴巴地说，还是有点慌张，因为渚薰注意到了我刚才的悄悄话。

"What about you two, though? No children, yet, I take it?" Kaworu asks, distant, probing gently, but genially, his words making Shinji and I flush at the same time.  
"那你们俩呢？还没有孩子，对吧？" 渚薰问道，语气遥远而温和，他的话让真嗣和我同时脸红。

"No, uh, not yet," Shinji says, coughing a bit into his hand and wiping it on his jeans.  
"不，呃，还没有，" 真嗣说着，用手捂嘴轻咳了一下，然后擦在牛仔裤上。

"Any plans, though?" He asks, though, before we can stammer out an embarrassed 'no', the nurse pops back in, placing a piece of paper in Kaworu's hand.  
"有什么打算吗？" 他问道，不过在我们尴尬地结巴出"没有"之前，护士又突然进来，将一张纸放在薰的手中。

"At your quickest convenience, please," she says, disappearing as easily as she had shown up.  
"请尽快，" 她说完，就像出现时一样悄无声息地消失了。

"Birth Certificate?" Shinji asks as Kaworu and Rei look at the rectangle of paper.  
"出生证明？" 真嗣问道，此时薰和零正看着那张矩形的纸。

They nod, Kaworu searching for a pen.  
他们点头，薰在寻找一支笔。

"Here," I say, handing them the pen I used earlier, placing the card and miniature bouquet on the night stand.  
“这里，”我说着，递给他们我之前用过的笔，并将卡片和小束花放在床头柜上。

"Thank you, Sohryu," Kaworu murmurs, another small smile on his face as he clicks the pen's nib out. "What do you think, Rei? What should we name her?"  
"谢谢你，惣流，" 渚薰低声说道，脸上又浮现出一丝微笑，同时按出了笔尖。"你觉得呢，绫波？我们应该给她起什么名字？"

She lifts her lips up to his ear, and as she murmurs something I can't quite hear, except for a slight "o" her mouth makes in the middle; Kaworu's glance flickers over to my face, evident shock and amusement making his eyebrows and lips curve upward.  
她将嘴唇贴近他的耳朵，当她低语着什么我听不太清楚的话时，只听到她口中发出轻微的"哦"声；渚薰的目光迅速扫过我的脸，明显的震惊和笑意使他的眉毛和嘴角上扬。

"Sukii it is, then," he murmurs, smiling up at us. "That's alright, that we name her for you two?"  
"那么就叫她 Sukii 吧，" 他低声说道，微笑着抬头看向我们。"我们用你们俩的名字给她命名，这样可以吗？"

"S-sure, I guess," Shinji says, blushing a bit, his hand resting a bit behind his head.  
"嗯，好吧，" 碇真嗣说道，脸上泛起一丝红晕，手不自觉地放在了脑后。

"Why not?" I reply, feeling a smirk wander up my face.  
"为什么不呢？" 我回答道，嘴角不由自主地上扬，露出一丝微笑。

"Again, thank you," Rei says quietly, her fingers grasping the pen from Kaworu's hand, and swiftly writing characters on the certificate.  
"再次感谢你，" 绫波丽轻声说道，她的手指从渚薰手中接过笔，迅速在证书上书写着字迹。

"Nice," he remarks gently, looking at the child, pulling back the blanket covering her head, revealing pale white skin, with a whisper of hair, blue-white, across her head. "Hey, there, Sukii," he says, his voice waking her, and her eyelids flutter open, showing a bright, just-born blue, gaze upon the world.  
"真好，"他温柔地评论道，看着孩子，轻轻拉回盖在她头上的毯子，露出苍白的皮肤，头上有一抹淡淡的蓝白色头发。"嘿，小光，"他说，声音唤醒了她，她的眼皮颤动着睁开，露出明亮、初生的蓝色，凝视着这个世界。

As all four of us leave the hospital, Shinji hangs back, holding my shoulder lightly.  
我们四个人离开医院时，真嗣稍稍落后，轻轻地扶着我的肩膀。

"What is it, Shinji?" I ask, raising an eyebrow. Before I realize it, his hand rises, and slides down from my left temple to the corner of my mouth, curving to cup my cheek for just a second.  
"怎么了，真嗣？"我问，扬起一边眉毛。还没等我反应过来，他的手就抬了起来，从我的左太阳穴滑到嘴角，轻轻地捧住我的脸颊，只停留了一秒。

"Thank you, again, Asuka... for coming with me," he says softly, moving the hand to mine, lacing his fingers with mine, smiling again.  
"再次感谢你，明日香……愿意陪我一起来，"他轻声说道，将手移到我的手上，手指与我交缠，再次微笑。

"You're welcome, again," I murmur, resting my head on his shoulder as we rejoin Rei and Kaworu.  
"不用谢，再次的，"我低语着，将头靠在他的肩上，我们重新加入了绫波和薰。
