An accident at an Evangelion test makes Shinji and Asuka interchange something very important  
在一次 EVA 测试事故中，真嗣和明日香交换了非常重要的东西

Disclaimer: I do not own the characters of Evangelion, GAINAX does. I'm just borrowing them, I'll give them back when I'm done.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》中的角色，GAINAX 才是他们的所有者。我只是借用他们，完成后会将他们归还。  
  
  
This story takes place a little past the middle of the main story of Evangelion, after the part when the three kids have to make all those compatibility tests, seeing if one pilot can use another Eva (Remember when Rei got on Eva 01 and Shinji in Evo 00). After the attack of 12th angel, but before the 13th angel takes over the Evangelion unit 03.  
本故事发生在《新世纪福音战士》主线剧情的中间稍后部分，即三个孩子进行了所有那些兼容性测试之后，看看一个驾驶员是否能使用另一台 EVA（记得丽登上 EVA 01 而真嗣在 EVA 00 上的情节吗）。在第 12 使徒攻击之后，但在第 13 使徒控制 EVA 03 之前。  

One more thing. Please keep in mind that, being from South America, english is my second language.  
还有一点，请记住，由于我来自南美洲，英语是我的第二语言。
  
With that over, on with the story.  
既然那件事结束了，故事继续。

---
Another test. 又一个测试。  
Another long, boring, and seemingly pointless test.  
又一个漫长、乏味且看似毫无意义的测试。  
Needles to say, Asuka Langley Shoryu was bored out of her mind.  
不用说，惣流·明日香·兰格雷已经无聊到极点了。  
  
Well, Shinji was bored too, but he never complained, unlike Asuka who said so all the time.  
嗯，真嗣也很无聊，但他从不抱怨，不像明日香总是说个不停。  
  
The whole week have been of pure tests, seeing how the synchronization ratios of each children were with their respective Evas, all type of tests of the sort.  
整个星期都在进行各种测试，观察每个孩子与他们各自的 EVA 的同步率，各种类似的测试。  
  
Rei had been sent home for the day, she had tried to pilot Eva 01, and her synch ratios had been good with it like it had been with unit 00.  
丽今天被送回家了，她尝试驾驶 Eva 01，与它的同步率很高，就像与 00 号机一样。  
  
That only left Shinji and Asuka.  
只剩下真嗣和明日香了。  
Ritsuko had them get into their respective Evas to update the info on their synch ratios with them, and then told them to switch units. With Shinji in unit 02 and Asuka in unit 01.  
律子让他们各自进入自己的 Eva，更新与它们的同步率数据，然后告诉他们交换机体。真嗣驾驶 02 号机，明日香驾驶 01 号机。  
  
"Shinji, you better not ruin anything in my beautiful Evangelion 02, got it!?" Said Asuka from the intercom between the two Evas.  
“真嗣，你最好别在我的美丽零二号机里搞砸任何事，明白了吗？！”明日香通过两台 EVA 之间的对讲机说道。  
  
"Yes." Replied Shinji flatly, not wanting to argue with Asuka right now. After all, she had called him a pervert when he said that unit 00 'smelled like Rei' when he was piloting it.  
“是。”真嗣平淡地回答，此刻并不想和明日香争论。毕竟，当他驾驶零零号机时说它“闻起来像丽”，她曾骂他是变态。  
  
Asuka had been using unit 02 at the time, so she didn't understand. Rei on the other hand, had clearly said that unit 01 felt like Shinji. So he knew that he was right.  
当时明日香正在使用零二号机，所以她无法理解。而另一方面，丽明确说过零一号机感觉像真嗣。因此他知道自己是对的。  
But he was Shinji after all, and would not argue with anyone, no matter if he knew that he was right.  
但毕竟他是真嗣，无论如何都不会与人争辩，即便他知道自己是对的。  
  
"Okay now kids, pipe down." Ritsuko's voice came from the communicators of both Evas, "we are going to begin the test now, ready."  
“好了，孩子们，安静下来。”律子的声音从两台 EVA 的通讯器中传来，“我们即将开始测试，准备好了吗？”  
  
"Yes." Replied Shinji. “是。”真嗣回答道。  
"Of course I'm ready, I'm always ready. Now can we do this and go home?" Replied Asuka.  
“我当然准备好了，我一直都准备着。现在我们可以开始然后回家吗？”明日香回答道。  
  
Ritsuko ignored Asuka's comment and turned off the communication with both Evas. Then she turned to look at Maya. "Let's begin the test."  
律子无视了明日香的话，关闭了与两台 EVA 的通讯。然后她转向看向真希波，“我们开始测试吧。”  
  
Maya nodded, "Yes, both Evas are being started... now!"  
真希波点头，“好的，两台 EVA 正在启动中……现在！”  
  
Both Shinji and Asuka felt how the world around them was going alive, and got the familiar sensation when the two of them got into their evas.  
真嗣和明日香都感受到了周围世界逐渐苏醒的气息，当他们进入 EVA 时，那种熟悉的感觉再次涌上心头。  
But that lasted just a second. After that, everything seemed to fall apart.  
但那仅仅持续了一瞬间。随后，一切似乎都开始分崩离析。  
  
"ARRRGGGHHH!!!" Both Asuka and Shinji felt like their very being was being thorn appart, the two of them hugged themselves as they threw their heads back and screamed.  
“啊啊啊啊啊！！！”真嗣和明日香感到自己的存在仿佛被撕裂，两人抱紧自己，仰头尖叫。  
  
"What's going on!" Asked a very worried Misato, turning to look at Ritsuko.  
“怎么回事！” 美里非常担忧地转头看向律子。  
  
"I don't know! This never happened before!" Replied Ritsuko, "Maya, what's going on!?"  
“我不知道！以前从未发生过这种情况！” 律子回答道，“玛雅，到底怎么了！？”  
  
"The readings are off scale! Both children seem to have a thorn in their souls! Ity's the Evas! I can't shut them down! They are not responding!" Replied Maya.  
“读数超出了量程！两个孩子似乎灵魂都受到了创伤！是 EVA！我无法关闭它们！它们没有反应！” 玛雅回答道。  
  
"Get them out of there now!" Demanded Misato.  
“现在就把他们弄出来！”美里命令道。  
  
"I CAN'T! We have to wait till whatever is going on is over, and then pray that they are okay." Replied Ritsuko, her voice showing that she was upset too, but knowing that yelling wouldn't do any good right now.  
“我做不到！我们必须等到这一切结束，然后祈祷他们平安无事。”律子回答，她的声音透露出她也很难过，但明白此刻大喊大叫无济于事。  
  
Inside the Evas, both Asuka and Shinji felt like if the cores of their being were being replaced with another one. It was too much for the two of them, and they fell unconcious inside the LCL filled entry plug.  
在 EVA 内部，明日香和真嗣都感觉仿佛自己的核心正在被替换。这对他们两人来说太过沉重，他们在充满 LCL 的插入栓内失去了意识。  
  
And then, it was over.  
然后，一切结束了。  
  
"The Evas have ceased their functions, it's over." Said Maya as she looked at her monitor.  
"EVA 机体已停止运作，结束了。" 玛雅看着她的屏幕说道。  
  
"How are the pilots?" Asked Misato.  
"驾驶员们情况如何？" 美里问道。  
  
"Stable. But unconcious." Replied Maya.  
"稳定，但昏迷。" 玛雅回答道。  
  
"Send a medical team to get them to the infirmary, we have to see what happened in there." Answered Ritsuko.  
"派一支医疗队把他们送到医务室，我们必须弄清楚里面发生了什么。" 律子回答道。  
  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
  
One hour later. 一小时后。  
  
Shinji and Asuka were both transported from the Evas to the infirmary. They were placed in the same room in separate beds.  
真嗣和明日香都被从 EVA 中转移到了医务室。他们被安排在同一间病房，但分别躺在不同的床上。  
  
Asuka slowly opened her eyes. The first thing she noticed was that she was in the infirmay.  
明日香缓缓睁开眼睛。她首先注意到的是自己身处医务室。  
  
How humiliating! How could she, the great and powerful Asuka Langley Shoryu, be in ... wait ... great and powerful? Why did she said that? Somehow it felt wrong ... it was funny, she of all people should be convinced that she was more superior than anyone ... but if that was the case, why did she felt different now?  
真是丢脸！她，伟大的明日香·兰格雷·小柳，怎么会在...等等...伟大且强大？她为什么这么说？不知怎么的，这感觉不对...这很有趣，她应该坚信自己比任何人都更优越...但如果是这样，为什么她现在感觉不一样了呢？  
She tried to get angry with herself for saying that, and found that it was easy to do so. Trying to focus that on something else, she tried to think about her superiority over others again.  
她试图对自己说出那番话感到愤怒，发现这样做很容易。她试图将这种情绪转移到其他事情上，再次尝试思考自己对别人的优越感。  
And again she couldn't do it ... all she could think about was how pathetic she was ... WHAT!? Pathetic! No ... that wasn't right! That couldn't be right! She was Asuka Langley! The pilot of unit 02, and ... and ... and she couldn't think anything else ...  
然而，她再次做不到……满脑子都是自己有多么可悲……什么！？可悲！不……不对！这不可能是对的！她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！二号机的驾驶员，而且……而且……她想不出别的了……  
She could, however, think of reasons of why she WASN'T great and powerful. She remembered all the times when she tried to take down an angel by herself, how she had always messed things up, and Shinji would always fix things by defeating the angels by himself, being succesful were she had failed.  
不过，她能想到自己并非伟大和强大的理由。她记得所有那些试图独自击败使徒的时刻，她总是把事情搞砸，而真嗣总是独自击败使徒，成功地弥补了她的失败。  
What was going on here!? Shinji! Better that her! NO! ... Wait ... yes, he was ... his synch ratios were better than hers, his victories were more than hers and more impressive that hers, and she owed him her life many times and ...  
这里到底发生了什么！？真嗣！比她更好！不！……等等……是的，他确实……他的同步率比她高，他的胜利次数比她多，而且更令人印象深刻，她多次欠他救命之恩……  
Asuka felt like she was going to freak out, something was wrong here. VERY wrong! Somehow, all this that should feel very wrong to her felt absolutely familiar, she was pathetic, she was just a bother to everyone ... the thoughts kept coming at her and no matter what she did, she could not push the thoughts away, nor argue with what they were telling her, all she could do was stare up to the ceiling.  
明日香感觉自己快要崩溃了，有什么地方不对劲。非常不对劲！不知为何，这些本应让她感到非常不对劲的事情，却让她觉得异常熟悉，她很可悲，她只是个麻烦……这些念头不断涌来，无论她怎么做，都无法驱散这些想法，也无法反驳它们告诉她的事实，她只能盯着天花板。  
She had to do something, anything to distract herself from what was happening, at least for a second.  
她必须做点什么，任何事情都好，只要能暂时从正在发生的事情中分心。  
Looking up, she said the first thing that came to mind, "I don't recognize this ceiling." She said flatly.  
抬头望去，她脱口而出第一句话，“我不认识这天花板。”她平淡地说道。  
  
A few feet away from Asuka, on the other bed, Shinji was just coming to, as he opened his eyes slowly, trying to get them to focus and getting used to the light.  
在离明日香几英尺远的另一张床上，真嗣刚刚醒来，他缓缓睁开眼睛，试图让视线聚焦，并适应光线。  
He looked up, and noticed that he was in the infirmary.  
他抬头一看，发现自己身处医务室。  
Again, in the infirmary. Huh? Why was he felling like he shouldn't be here? After all, he ALWAYS ended up in the infirmary, he was a pathectic weakling.  
又一次，在医务室。嗯？为什么他觉得自己不该在这里？毕竟，他总是最终来到医务室，他是个可悲的弱者。  
Wait ... a pathetic weakling!? What the fuck is wrong with you! Shinji yelled at himself inside his head. You are Shinji Ikari for crying out loud! You pilot the Evangelion unit 01, you are the protector of the whole world! Yeah! That's right, he was NOT pathetic!  
等等……一个可悲的弱者？！你他妈的怎么了！真嗣在心里对自己大喊。你是真嗣·碇，拜托！你驾驶着 EVA 初号机，你是整个世界的守护者！没错！就是这样，他才不可悲！  
Then he felt like he had to find someone who WAS pathetic, just to convince himself of his superiority. Wait ... superiority? Were did that come from?  
然后他觉得他得找个真正可悲的人，只是为了说服自己他的优越性。等等……优越性？这想法是从哪儿冒出来的？  
It didn't matter, he was superior and that was out of the question.  
这无关紧要，他是优越的，这一点毋庸置疑。  
Asuka, now SHE was pathetic. Always acting all though around people, when he knew that she was a fragile as anyone else. As he remebered when she had been crying in her sleep, crying for her mother.  
明日香，她现在真是可悲。总是在人前装腔作势，但他知道她和其他人一样脆弱。就像他记得她曾在睡梦中哭泣，呼唤着她的母亲。  
Yeah, Asuka is pathetic, that was something that he could focus on without much problem.  
没错，明日香很可悲，这一点他可以毫不费力地集中注意力。  
Something on the back of his head told him that it was wrong, that he should not think of others like that, but it was quickly pushed away.  
他脑后有个声音告诉他这是不对的，他不应该那样想别人，但这个念头很快就被压了下去。  
Asuka was pathetic, whenever the Evas went out to fight the angels, she would always lose, and he had to come to her rescue like the weakling that she was. Yes, that's right, a weakling, Asuka was a weakling.  
明日香真是可悲，每当 EVA 出动去对抗使徒时，她总是会输，而他不得不像她那样弱小的人一样去救她。没错，就是个弱者，明日香就是个弱者。  
  
He then realized that he was finally completely awake, and having no intention of just laying down on a bed like some idiot, he sat up on the bed and looked around.  
他随后意识到自己终于完全清醒了，没有打算像个傻瓜一样躺在床上，于是他坐起身来，环顾四周。  
It was then that he noticed Asuka lying down on the other bed, with her eyes open staring right up at the ceiling.  
就在那时，他注意到明日香躺在另一张床上，眼睛睁得大大的，直直地盯着天花板。  
  
He smiled, a superior smile as he looked down at her and crossed his arms over his chest, looking as confident as possible. "Hey Asuka! What are you doing?"  
他微笑着，带着一种优越感俯视着她，双臂交叉在胸前，尽可能显得自信满满。“嘿，明日香！你在干什么？”  
  
Asuka heard Shinji's voice, and turned her head to look at him. When she looked at him like that, she felt even more insignificant. "I ... I was just staring at the ceiling."  
明日香听到真嗣的声音，转过头来看着他。当她那样看着他时，她感到自己更加渺小。“我……我只是盯着天花板。”  
  
"Staring at the ceiling? Well, only a weakling like you would waste her time looking up at the ceiling." Replied Shinji.  
“盯着天花板看？哼，只有你这种弱者才会浪费时间往上看。”真嗣回敬道。  
  
Asuka should have jumped out of the bed and yell at him for how he had talked to her. But she found out that she couldn't, all she could do was turn her head away, away from that superior gaze. All she did was reply, "I'm sorry."  
明日香本该跳下床，对他刚才的言辞大发雷霆。但她发现自己做不到，只能把头转向一边，避开那傲慢的目光。她所能做的，只是低声回应：“对不起。”  
  
"Humf!" Grunted Shinji, back in his head, very back in his head, something told him that it was wrong to treat Asuka like that, that she didn't deserve it. But he pushed it away. Asuka was a weakling, of course she deserved it!  
“哼！”真嗣咕哝着，内心深处，非常深处，有个声音告诉他这样对待明日香是不对的，她不该受到这样的对待。但他把这念头抛开了。明日香就是个弱者，她当然活该如此！  
  
"What ... what do you think happened?" Asked Asuka from the bed, never turning to look at him.  
"发生了...发生了什么，你觉得呢？" 明日香从床上问道，始终没有转头看他。  
  
Shinji turned his head to look at Asuka again, "What happened? How should I know!? But I can tell you this, I'm sure that it was your fault, there was something wrong with your unit 02, 'cause unit 01 was perfect and is WAY better that your stupid red Eva."  
真嗣再次转头看向明日香，"发生了什么？我怎么知道！？但我可以告诉你，我敢肯定这是你的错，你的二号机有问题，因为我的初号机完美无缺，比你那愚蠢的红色 Eva 强多了。"  
  
Somehow, Asuka didn't feel like arguing with that. She just said, "I'm sorry."  
不知为何，明日香并不想为此争论。她只是说："对不起。"  
  
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
  
Meanwhile, back in the testing facilities, Ritsuko had finished with the tests, and had found out what had happened.  
与此同时，在测试设施那边，律子已经完成了测试，并发现了问题所在。  
Now she had to explain it to Misato, since she was the tutor of both Shinji and Asuka.  
现在她得向美里解释这一切，毕竟她是真嗣和明日香两人的导师。  
  
She was hoping to avoid this, since she just knew that Misato was NOT going to be happy about this.  
她本希望避免这种情况，因为她很清楚，美里对此绝不会感到高兴。  
  
Misato was pacing nervously around the room, when she noticed Ritsuko walk in. "So?" She asked.  
美里紧张地在房间里踱步，这时她注意到律子走了进来。“所以？”她问道。  
  
"Well, we know what happened, but I don't know how to explain it." Replied Ritsuko.  
“嗯，我们知道发生了什么，但我不知道怎么解释。”律子回答道。  
  
"Just tell me what happened!" Demanded Misato.  
“直接告诉我发生了什么！”美里要求道。  
  
Ritsuko sighed and answered her, "their souls switched places."  
律子叹了口气，回答她：“他们的灵魂互换了位置。”  
  
"What!? What does that mean? Like a brain transplant or something?" Misato was still worried, but she wanted to understand what happened.  
“什么！？这是什么意思？像脑移植之类的吗？”美里仍然担忧，但她想弄明白发生了什么。  
  
Ritsuko shook her head. "No, that would be their minds. I said that they switched souls."  
律子摇了摇头。“不，那会是他们的大脑。我说的是他们互换了灵魂。”  
  
"Okay, I'm lost here. Could you explain that one please?" Said Misato.  
“好吧，我在这里迷糊了。你能解释一下吗？”美里说道。  
  
"Okay, I'll try." Replied Ritsuko, "the mind is how a person thinks and reacts, the mind is formed trough years of life, with day to day experiences, its what tells us who we are, and who other people are. The soul, in the other hand, its what determines who we really are. Unlike the mind, we are already born with a formed soul, which changes also day by day, what makes it change are the souls of the other people we meet every day, our experiences with others. So while our mind tells us what to do every day, our soul is what influences our mind into taking this or that decition or talking like this or like that to someone."  
“好的，我试试。”律子回答道，“心智是一个人思考和反应的方式，它是通过多年的生活，日复一日的经历形成的，它告诉我们自己是谁，别人是谁。而灵魂，则是决定我们真正本质的东西。与心智不同，我们一出生就拥有一个成型的灵魂，它也日复一日地变化，使其变化的是我们每天遇到的其他人灵魂，以及与他人的经历。因此，虽然我们的心智告诉我们每天该做什么，但我们的灵魂影响着我们的心智，使其做出这样的或那样的决定，或以这种方式或那种方式与某人交谈。”  
  
Misato blinked a few times, trying to understand everything. Then her eyes opened wide as she realized what Ritsuko was saying. "You ... you mean that ... that Shinji and Asuka ..."  
美里眨了几下眼睛，试图理解一切。然后她的眼睛睁得大大的，她意识到律子在说什么。“你……你是说……真嗣和明日香……”  
  
Ritsuko nodded, "Yes, even if Shinji is still Shinji and Asuka is still Asuka, Shinji will act like Asuka, and Asuka will act like Shinji."  
律子点头道：“是的，即便真嗣还是真嗣，明日香还是明日香，真嗣会表现得像明日香，而明日香会表现得像真嗣。”  
  
Misato was at a lose of words, finally she found the will to say, "oh boy ..."  
美里无言以对，终于她鼓起勇气说：“哦，天哪……”  
  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
  
Back in the infirmary. 回到医务室。  
  
Shinji had gotten up from the bed, not wanting to just lie down the rest of the day, and was pacing back and forth around the room.  
真嗣从床上起身，不想整天就这么躺着，于是在房间里来回踱步。  
  
Asuka was still on the bed, she was sitting up, and could only look at Shinji as he stepped back and forth.  
明日香还坐在床上，只能看着真嗣来回走动。  
Something felt out of place for the German girl, like she should be pacing around the room fussing about making them wait here in the infirmary while Shinji sat on the bed looking at her walk. But now that seemed ... not right.  
对于这位德国女孩来说，有些事情感觉不对劲，好像应该是她在房间里焦急地走来走去，而真嗣坐在床上看着她走动。但现在这样似乎...不太对劲。  
  
At first Shinji had that same feeling, that he was doing something that Asuka was supposed to be doing, while Asuka was doing something that he should be doing. But it was more easy for him to push that though away. He didn't know why, but all of a sudden he had all this confidence, and it seemed that Asuka was letting him push her around!  
起初，真嗣有种同样的感觉，仿佛他在做着本应是明日香做的事情，而明日香在做着他应该做的事情。但对他来说，更容易将这种念头抛诸脑后。他不知道为什么，但突然间他充满了自信，而且似乎明日香也在让他牵着鼻子走！  
  
If only they knew. 要是他们知道就好了。  
  
"Shinji ... hum, why don't you calm down, I'm sure they'll come soon." Said Asuka from her point on the bed.  
“真嗣……嗯，你为什么不冷静下来，我相信他们很快就会来的。”明日香从床上的位置说道。  
  
Shinji turned to look at Asuka, an annoyed look on his face that made Asuka jump back a little. "Shut up Asuka, I'm not bothering anyone. If I want to walk around the room, then I'll walk around the room!"  
真嗣转向看着明日香，脸上带着令明日香微微后退的恼怒表情。“闭嘴，明日香，我没有打扰任何人。如果我想在房间里走动，那我就会在房间里走动！”  
  
Asuka turned her head away, "Forgiben."  
明日香转过头去，“Forgiben。”  
(Forgiben: 'I'm sorry' in German, or at least I think it is, if I'm wrong here e-mail me.)  
（Forgiben：德语中的‘对不起’，至少我认为是，如果我错了请给我发邮件。）  
  
Shinji made an annoyed sound at that and then resumed his frantic pacing.  
对此，真嗣发出了一声不悦的声响，随后又继续他那急促的踱步。  
  
It was at that moment that the door of the room opened, and both Shinji and Asuka turned to look at whoever had walked in.  
就在这时，房间的门打开了，真嗣和明日香都转头看向走进来的人。  
  
It was Misato and Ritsuko, both seemed worried about something.  
进来的是美里和律子，两人似乎都为某事感到担忧。  
  
"So? Why are we here? Did something happen to us? When can we go home?" Asked Shinji, sounding annoyed and angry at being kept in the infirmary for so long, Asuka just sat on the bed, letting Shinji do all the talking.  
“所以呢？我们为什么在这里？我们出什么事了吗？我们什么时候能回家？” 真嗣问道，因长时间被留在医务室而显得既烦躁又生气，而明日香只是坐在床上，任由真嗣一个人说个不停。  
  
Misato and Ritsuko looked at each other and sighed, a sigh of resignation, Shinji's and Asuka's attitude had confirmed everything.  
美里和律子互相对视，叹了口气，这是无奈的叹息，真嗣和明日香的态度已经证实了一切。  
Then they both turned to look back at the two children.  
随后，她们俩都转过头来，再次看向那两个孩子。  
  
"Yes Shinji, something did happen in the Evas. How did it happen we don't know yet, we'll have to make a few more tests for that. And then try to find a way to fix it." Replied Ritsuko.  
“是的，真嗣，EVA 里确实发生了一些事情。具体是如何发生的我们还不清楚，需要进行更多的测试才能知道。然后我们再想办法解决。” 赤木律子回答道。  
  
"Fix it? What needs to be fixed? I feel great, no broken bones or anything." Replied Shinji.  
“解决？需要解决什么？我感觉很好，没有骨折或其他问题。” 真嗣回答道。  
  
"That's because the problem did ... what should be the word ... core damage." Said Ritsuko.  
“那是因为问题出在……应该用什么词呢……核心损伤。” 赤木律子说道。  
  
Asuka tilted her head in question, Shinji was more direct. "Meaning what?"  
明日香歪着头表示疑问，真嗣则更为直接。“什么意思？”  
  
"Whatever did happen there, you two kind of ... well, your souls switched places." Said Ritsuko finally.  
“不管那里发生了什么，你们俩……呃，你们的灵魂互换了位置。”律子终于说道。  
  
"WHAT!?" Now Shinji was angry AND confused.  
“什么！？”这下真嗣既生气又困惑。  
  
"What do you mean?" Asked Asuka, she was also a little worried, but didn't show it.  
"你是什么意思？" 明日香问道，她也有点担心，但没有表现出来。  
  
"It means that even though you two still remain the same person, your 'personalities' your 'essences' have been switched. In other words, Shinji has Asuka's personality while Asuka has Shinji's." Ritsuko finally explained.  
"这意味着尽管你们俩仍然是同一个人，但你们的'个性'，你们的'本质'已经被交换了。换句话说，真嗣拥有了明日香的个性，而明日香拥有了真嗣的。" 律子终于解释道。  
  
The two kids just remained immobile for about half a minute.  
两个孩子就这样呆立了大约半分钟。  
"We what!?" They asked in unison.  
“我们什么！？”他们异口同声地问道。  
  
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
  
That night, inside Misato's car. Misato Katsuragi was driving back home for the day, while Asuka and Shinji were sitting in the back seat.  
那晚，在美里小姐的车内。美里·葛城正驾车回家，而明日香和真嗣坐在后座。  
  
The three of them were in complete silence.  
三人完全沉默着。  
  
Once in a while, Misato looked up into the rear view mirror to see what they were doing.  
偶尔，美里会抬头通过后视镜看看他们在做什么。  
Shinji was resting his head on his right hand while he looked out the car window with an annoyed/angry look on his face.  
真嗣正用右手撑着头，一脸不悦/愤怒地望着车窗外面。  
Asuka, on the other hand, was sitting with her hands on her lap, her gaze down with a worried look on her face.  
而明日香则双手放在膝上，目光低垂，脸上带着忧虑的神情。  
  
Misato didn't know if she wanted to laugh or to cry.  
美里不知道自己是想笑还是想哭。

---
Misato yawned as she woke up.  
美里打着哈欠醒来。  
  
It had been a LOOOOOOONG night yesterday. First, the whole ride home, Shinji had been blaming this whole thing on Asuka, telling the german girl that it was because of something wrong with the Eva 02, since HIS Eva 01 was in perfect working condition, and all that kind of things.  
昨晚真是漫长的一夜。首先，回家的路上，真嗣一直把整件事归咎于明日香，对德国女孩说这是因为二号机出了问题，而他的零一号机状况良好，诸如此类的话。  
  
And even worst, Asuka just looked down at her feet, saying "I'm sorry" every now and then.  
甚至更糟的是，明日香只是低头看着自己的脚，时不时地说着“对不起”。  
  
That was just not right.  
这完全不对劲。  
  
Misato walked out of her room, and to the kitchen/dining room, to get some breakfast.  
美里走出自己的房间，来到厨房/餐厅，准备吃早餐。  
  
"Guten morgen Misato-san." Greeted Asuka, turning to look at her when she walked in, who was cooking breakfast. She was even wearing the apron!  
“早安，美里小姐。”明日香问候道，转身看着她走进来，正在做早餐。她甚至还穿着围裙！  
  
"Good morning Misato." Said Shinji who was eating breakfast on the table. And what was that can in front of his plate ... Yebisu beer!?  
“早安，美里。”正在餐桌吃早餐的真嗣说道。他面前盘子上的那个罐子是什么……惠比寿啤酒！？  
  
"Huh? Asuka? Why ... why are you making breakfast? It's Tuesday, it's Shinji's turn ..." Said Misato, too confused to even move to sit down.  
“咦？明日香？为什么……你为什么在做早餐？今天是星期二，轮到真嗣了……”美里太过困惑，甚至忘了坐下。  
  
Shinji was the one to answer, "Simple, I traded all my chores to Asuka."  
“很简单，我把所有的家务都和明日香交换了。” 真嗣回答道。  
  
"What!? Why ... I mean ... why ... just ... why!?"  
“什么！？为什么……我是说……为什么……就……为什么！？”  
  
"Well, it figured that it was not fair for me to waste all my precious time, while she doesn't do anything. Don't you think so?" Replied Shinji.  
“嗯，我觉得让我浪费所有宝贵的时间，而她却什么都不做，这不公平。你不这么认为吗？” 真嗣回应道。  
  
"NO! I DON'T think so. What are you doing? You can't just give all your chores to Asuka because you feel like it!" Said Misato in outrage. "And what are you doing drinking beer!?"  
“不！我不这么认为。你在干什么？你不能因为自己想偷懒就把所有家务都推给明日香！” 美里愤怒地说道。“还有，你喝啤酒干什么！？”  
  
"Oh this? Don't worry, I'm not gonna drink enough to get drunk. I'm just trying to see why you make so much fuss about it every morning." Replied Shinji.  
“哦，这个？别担心，我不会喝到醉的。我只是想看看为什么你每天早上都对此大惊小怪。” 真嗣回答道。  
  
Misato put her hands on her head, she could feel a BIG headache coming. "Whatever, look ... you can't give your chores to Asuka, it's not right."  
美里双手抱头，她感觉到一阵剧烈的头痛即将袭来。“随便你，听着……你不能把家务推给明日香，这不公平。”  
  
Asuka spoke for the first time, "It's okay Misato-san, really it is."  
明日香第一次开口，“没事的，美里小姐，真的没事。”  
  
"You stay out of this Asuka. I'm talking to Shinji!" Replied an upset Misato, used to take that tone with Asuka when she didn't listen to reason.  
“你别插手，明日香。我在和真嗣说话！”美里不悦地回应，习惯了用这种语气对待不听劝的明日香。  
  
But this wasn't the same Asuka as before, all she did was look down, fidgeting with the edge of the apron, and said, "I'm sorry."  
但这次不再是以前那个明日香，她只是低头摆弄着围裙的边缘，轻声说：“对不起。”  
  
Hearing that, Misato remembered why they were acting like this in the first place, and immediately regretted talking to poor Asuka that way. "Oh, Asuka, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to tell you that ... I'm just so confused ... I'm sorry."  
听到这话，美里想起了他们最初为何如此行事，立刻后悔以那种方式对可怜的明日香说话。“哦，明日香，对不起，我不是有意那么说的……我只是太困惑了……对不起。”  
  
Asuka smiled a little. "It's okay Misato-san."  
明日香微微一笑。“没关系，美里小姐。”  
  
"No, it's not okay. The whole universe its upside down!" Misato looked back at Shinji. "And you mister, I can't believe that you would just force Asuka to do your chores! That's not like you."  
“不，这不对劲。整个宇宙都颠倒了！”美里回头看着真嗣。“还有你，先生，我真不敢相信你会强迫明日香做你的家务！这不像你。”  
  
Shinji grinned. "Well, that was the old Shinji. Besides, I never forced her, I told her to do my chores and she said yes. All those weeks of her bossing around everyone and everything, now that the roles have finally changed, I'm gonna make the most of it."  
真嗣咧嘴笑了。“那是过去的真嗣了。再说了，我可没强迫她，我只是让她帮我做家务，她答应了。她那几周对每个人都指手画脚的，现在角色终于互换了，我可要好好利用这个机会。”  
  
"Shinji! I know you! That's not how you are!" Said Misato.  
“真嗣！我了解你！你不是那样的人！”美里说道。  
  
"I know, ain't it great." Replied Shinji, finishing his breakfast.  
“我知道，是不是很棒。”真嗣回答道，吃完了他的早餐。  
  
"Argh! Just give me a beer!" Misato said, sitting down to eat breakfast.  
"啊！给我来杯啤酒！" 美里说着，坐下来吃早餐。  
  
Asuka handed Misato a beer, as she and Shinji picked up their respective school bags and put on their shoes at the entrance.  
明日香递给美里一杯啤酒，她和真嗣各自拿起书包，在门口穿上鞋子。  
  
"Good bye Misato. We're off to school." Said Asuka as she walked out the door.  
"再见，美里。我们去上学了。" 明日香走出门口时说道。  
  
"Yeah! I can't wait to talk to Touji and Kensuke about this!" Said Shinji, just before closing the door behind him.  
“耶！我迫不及待要和东治和健介聊这个了！” 真嗣说着，随即关上了身后的门。  
  
At the table, Misato coughed after trying to drink her beer, just when Shinji said that last thing.  
在桌旁，美里在尝试喝啤酒时呛了一下，正好是真嗣说完那句话的时候。  
  
==================  
  
That same morning, a while later. At NERV's main building:  
同一天早上，稍晚些时候。在 NERV 的主楼：  
  
Mistao had asked Ritsuko to have a private talk about this whole Shinji and Asuka switching souls. Misato told Ritsuko what had happened in the ride home, and then what she saw this morning at breakfast.  
美里曾请求律子私下谈谈关于真嗣和明日香灵魂互换的整个事件。美里向律子讲述了回家途中的经过，以及今早在早餐时所见。  
  
After hearing all this, Ritsuko took a sip of her coffee, put a finger on her lower lip and said, "Hmmm..."  
听完这一切后，律子啜了一口咖啡，用手指轻触下唇，说道：“嗯……”  
  
"So? What do you make of all this?" Asked Misato.  
“那么？你怎么看这一切？”美里问道。  
  
"You shouldn't be surprised about all this. After all, Shinji has now Asuka's personality. We all know that Asuka used to boss people around. Now is the same thing, only that is Shinji bossing Asuka." Replied Ritsuko.  
“你对这一切不应该感到惊讶。毕竟，现在真嗣拥有了明日香的性格。我们都知道明日香以前喜欢指挥别人。现在情况一样，只不过是真嗣在指挥明日香。” 律子回答道。  
  
"Maybe so. But there was something else; Shinji wasn't acting like Asuka did. I mean, Asuka bossed him around, but she never made him do her chores nor she drank my beer." Answered Misato.  
“也许是这样。但还有别的事情；真嗣的行为并不像明日香那样。我的意思是，明日香确实指挥过他，但她从没让他做她的家务，也没喝过我的啤酒。” 美里回答道。  
  
Ritsuko took another sip of her coffee. Then she sighed and continued her explanation "I was afraid of that. Shinji and Asuka might have switched souls, but they did not change minds. Shinji still remembers who he is and who he was, but more important of all, how he used to be. So does Asuka."  
律子又喝了一口咖啡。然后她叹了口气，继续解释道：“我担心的是这个。真嗣和明日香可能交换了灵魂，但他们的思想并没有改变。真嗣仍然记得自己是谁，曾经是谁，更重要的是，他曾经是怎样的。明日香也是如此。”  
  
"What's your point?" asked Misato.  
"你到底想说什么？" 美里问道。  
  
"I'm getting to it." Answered Ritsuko, "As I was saying. The souls that they have now are trying to cope with what they did when they had their original souls. Asuka is feeling an incredible amount of guilt from how she used to boss Shinji around, and is trying to do everything she can to forgive herself. In the other hand, Shinji remembers how Asuka used to boss him around, but now he sees that as wrong, and he has to change roles completely by being even more of a controlling and demanding person that Asuka ever was."  
"我正要说呢。" 律子回答，"正如我刚才所说，他们现在的灵魂正在努力应对他们拥有原灵魂时所做的事情。明日香因为过去对真嗣颐指气使而感到极大的内疚，正竭尽全力试图原谅自己。另一方面，真嗣记得明日香过去是如何指挥他的，但现在他认为那是错误的，他必须彻底转变角色，成为一个比明日香曾经更加控制和苛求的人。"  
  
"That is not something that I'm looking forwards to." Said Misato while placing a hand on her forehead. "We have to find a way to switch them back soon."  
"那可不是我期待的事。" 美里说着，把手放在额头上，"我们必须尽快找到办法把他们换回来。"  
  
"We're working on it, but this isn't something that simple. It'll take time. A LOT of time." She took another sip of her coffee, "So, where are they now?"  
"我们正在努力，但这不是件简单的事。需要时间，很多时间。" 她又啜了一口咖啡，"那么，他们现在在哪儿？"  
  
"School." Replied Misato.  
"在学校。" 美里回答道。"  
  
"Well, now that would be something interesting to see." Said Ritsuko.  
"嗯，那倒是件有趣的事。" 律子说道。"

End of chapter two. chapter章 完  
  
To be continued... 未完待续...  
  
Author's notes: I know it's a bit short, but the only way to continue this now would be their school day, and I'm still trying to get ideas on that.  
作者笔记：我知道这章有点短，但接下来要继续的话只能写他们的学校生活了，我还在为那部分构思中。  
  
In the next chapter, Shinji and Asuka have to face their first day of school whit the switch.  
在接下来的chapter中，真嗣和明日香不得不面对转学后的第一天。

---
While Ritsuko and Misato were talking about Shinji and Asuka, the two teens in question were on their way to school.  
当律子和美里谈论着真嗣和明日香时，这两个当事人正走在上学的路上。

"You want me to carry your bag" asked Asuka, as Shinji held his schoolbag in front of her.  
“你想让我帮你拿书包吗？”明日香问道，此时真嗣正把他的书包举在她面前。

"Yes." replied Shinji. “是的。” 真嗣回答道。

"But why? I didn't do anything." Complained Asuka. The old Asuka would have just punched Shinji, but since she now held Shinji's soul in her body, she reacted like that.  
“但为什么？我什么都没做。” 明日香抱怨道。以前的明日香可能会直接揍真嗣，但自从她的身体里有了真嗣的灵魂后，她的反应就变成了这样。

"Why you ask? Well, I think it is a just payback from all the times YOU made ME carry YOUR bag to school." Replied Shinji, as he shoved his schoolbag into Asuka's hands.  
“你问为什么？嗯，我想这是对你以前让我帮你拿书包去学校的所有次数的正当回报。” 真嗣回答道，同时把他的书包塞到明日香手里。

Asuka looked down as she held both her and Shinji's schoolbags, one in each hand. "Yes, you're right Shinji. . . it is the least I can do. I am sorry."  
明日香低头看着自己一手一个，分别拿着她和真嗣的书包。“是的，你说得对，真嗣……这是我起码能做的。对不起。”

Asuka started to walk, when Shinji suddenly grabbed the back of her shirt and pulled her back.  
明日香刚要走，真嗣突然抓住她衬衫的后摆，把她拉了回来。

"Whoa" 哇哦

This caused Asuka to fall back on her butt, dropping both schoolbags in the process. "Ouch? Why did you do that" asked Asuka as she stood up.  
这导致明日香一屁股坐倒在地，书包也顺势掉落。“哎哟？你干嘛这样？”明日香站起来问道。

"You were walking in front of me" replied Shinji"Since I am WAY more superior than you in every way possible, then you should walk behind me." He added.  
“你走在我前面了。”真嗣回答道，“既然我在各方面都比你强得多，那你应该走在我后面。”他补充说。

"Good morning." “早上好。”

Both Shinji and Asuka turned back when they heard that familiar voice.  
听到那个熟悉的声音，真嗣和明日香同时转过身来。

Rei Ayanami, the other Eva pilot, was standing there, in her usual school uniform, and with her usual neutral face.  
绫波零，另一位 EVA 驾驶员，站在那里，穿着她一贯的校服，脸上依旧是那副中性的表情。

The blue haired girl had been informed by her superiors at NERV what had happened with both Shinji and Asuka the day before. How the two Eva pilots had switched souls, which made them, in a way, act like the other but still be the same person.  
蓝发女孩已经从 NERV 的上级那里得知了昨天真嗣和明日香发生的事情。两位 EVA 驾驶员灵魂互换，这让他们在某种程度上表现得像对方，但本质上仍是同一个人。

Rei didn't understand it well herself, however, she had been ordered to keep an eye on both of her fellow pilots at school today, and she always followed orders.  
丽自己也不太明白，然而，她被命令今天在学校里要留意两位同伴驾驶员，而她总是遵守命令。

Seeing Rei caused different reactions on Shinji and Asuka, which was a result of having their own minds and memories, but with the other pilot's soul.  
看到丽，真嗣和明日香产生了不同的反应，这是因为他们各自的心灵和记忆，但同时又拥有对方的灵魂。

Asuka had always disliked Rei, however, all the things that her mind always though about Rei which made Asuka dislike her, were now confronting Shinji's soul about it. Now those things were not flaws, they were good things, things that made Rei a good Eva pilot and a very important member of NERV. Rei always followed the rules, always followed orders regardless of putting her life at risk. The old Asuka would have seen in Rei a competitor to being he best Eva pilot, but since that wasn't an issue anymore, Asuka found that she rather liked Rei. She sort of looked up to her in a way.  
明日香一直不喜欢丽，然而，她心中对丽的种种不满，现在却要面对真嗣的灵魂。如今这些不再是缺点，而是优点，是让丽成为优秀 EVA 驾驶员和 NERV 重要成员的特质。丽总是遵守规则，无论是否危及生命，总是服从命令。过去的明日香可能会将丽视为争夺最佳 EVA 驾驶员的竞争对手，但既然这不再是问题，明日香发现自己其实挺喜欢丽的。某种程度上，她甚至有点仰慕她。

All this together caused Asuka to react in the following way:  
这一切加在一起，导致明日香做出了如下反应：

"Good morning Ayanami-san." Said Asuka in a respectful way.  
“早上好，绫波同学。”明日香恭敬地说道。

Shinji in the other hand was having a mixture of emotions. Shinji had always felt a rather fondness towards Rei. In fact, Shinji felt a certain attraction to Rei, but Rei's cold demeanor made him feel like the blue haired girl was a mile away every time.  
另一方面，真嗣正经历着复杂的情感。真嗣一直对绫波抱有一种特别的亲切感。事实上，真嗣对绫波有着某种吸引力，但绫波冷漠的态度总让他觉得这位蓝发女孩遥不可及。

However, Shinji had now Asuka's soul. He still had the same thoughts about Rei, but her mind and his soul were giving mixed messages. Asuka had always acted very aggressive towards Rei when she followed orders and all that, but still saw her as a fellow pilot, as the only female pilot besides her. But Asuka's soul was in Shinji's body, and Shinji was not a girl, which made that last thing pretty useless.  
然而，现在绫波的灵魂在真嗣体内。他对丽的感觉依旧，但她的心智和他的灵魂却在传递着混杂的信息。明日香总是对丽表现出强烈的敌意，当她服从命令时也是如此，但她仍将丽视为同伴，除了她之外唯一的女性驾驶员。但明日香的灵魂在真嗣的身体里，而真嗣不是女孩，这让最后一点变得毫无意义。

Both points of view exchanged ideas for a while, until finally, they compromised.  
两种观点交流了一段时间，最终达成了妥协。

Shinji still had feelings for Rei, but he completely denied them, and decided to act very cold towards him. He was sure that, if he started acting that way, ignoring her, she would eventually show an interest to him.  
真嗣对丽仍有感情，但他完全否认了这一点，并决定对她表现得非常冷淡。他确信，如果他开始那样做，忽视她，她最终会对他产生兴趣。

Of course that Shinji wasn't really aware of all that was happening to him on the inside. All he know was that he should act like he really didn't care about Rei's presence.  
当然，真嗣并没有真正意识到自己内心正在经历的一切。他所知道的只是，他应该表现得好像真的不在乎绫波的存在。

And so, he replied like this:  
于是，他这样回答道：

"Good morning." Said Shinji flatly, not even turning to look at Rei.  
“早上好。”真嗣平淡地说道，甚至没有转头去看绫波。

Shinji walked past Rei, and towards the school.  
真嗣从丽身边走过，向学校走去。

"Come on, we're going to be late." He called back to the two girls.  
“快点，我们要迟到了。”他回头对两个女孩喊道。

"Yes, I'm sorry, I'll hurry up." Said Asuka as she picked up her schoolbag and Shinji's and started walking behind him.  
“好的，对不起，我会快点。”明日香说着拿起自己的书包和真嗣的，开始跟在他后面走。

Ayanami just watched the exchange of words, noticing that neither Asuka nor Shinji were their usual self this morning.  
绫波只是静静地观察着这场对话，注意到今早无论是明日香还是真嗣都与往常不同。

The blue haired girl started walking behind the two soon afterwards.  
蓝发女孩不久后便跟在了两人身后。

Meanwhile, back at NERV: 与此同时，在 NERV 总部：

"What do you mean by that" asked Misato after hearing what Ritsuko said.  
“你这是什么意思？”听到律子的话后，美里问道。

"Just what you heard. Even after we manage to switch Shinji's and Asuka's souls back to their respective owners, they would still have side effects." She explained.  
“正如你所听到的。即使我们设法将真嗣和明日香的灵魂交换回各自的身体，他们仍会有副作用。”她解释道。

Ritsuke knew that Misato was going to ask just WHAT side effects she was talking about, so she decided to go ahead and explain herself. "Like I said before. People are already born with a formed soul, which changes day by day, what makes it change are the souls of the other people we meet every day, our experiences with others. Shinji has now Asuka's soul, and Asuka has Shinji's. However, they still have their own minds. The mind is how a person thinks and reacts, the mind is formed trough years of life, with day to day experiences, its what tells us who we are, and who other people are. Acting together, our mind and soul makes us who we are, while our mind tells us what to do every day, our soul is what influences our mind into taking this or that decision or talking like this or like that to someone. However, since Shinji and Asuka only switched souls, this means that the soul of the other will also change every day, and their mind will change too."  
律子知道美里会问她到底指的是哪些副作用，所以她决定提前解释清楚。“就像我之前说的，人们天生就拥有一个成型的灵魂，它会随着时间的推移而变化，促使它变化的是我们每天遇到的其他人，以及与他人的经历。现在，真嗣拥有了明日香的灵魂，而明日香拥有了真嗣的。不过，他们仍然保留着自己的意识。意识是一个人思考和反应的方式，它是通过多年的生活经历，日复一日的体验形成的，它告诉我们自己是谁，别人是谁。意识和灵魂共同塑造了我们，意识指导我们每天的行为，而灵魂则影响我们的意识做出这样的或那样的决定，或者这样或那样地与某人交谈。然而，由于真嗣和明日香只是交换了灵魂，这意味着对方的灵魂也会每天发生变化，他们的意识也会随之改变。”

"You mean that, if we don't switch them back soon, they will just go back to normal by themselves" asked Misato.  
“你的意思是，如果我们不尽快把他们换回来，他们就会自己恢复正常？”美里问道。

"On the contrary." Said Ritsuko"if we don't find a way to change them back soon. They will both be too influenced by the other, and will still not be completely like themselves. There are too many ways for it to end, the possibilities are too many, and it would be impossible to just guess what would happen."  
"恰恰相反。" 律子说道，"如果我们不尽快找到方法将他们变回来，他们俩都会受到对方过多的影响，仍然无法完全恢复自我。结局的可能性太多，可能性如此之多，根本无法猜测会发生什么。"

Misato was worried. She hoped that they would find a way to switch Shinji and Asuka back to normal soon.  
美里感到担忧。她希望他们能尽快找到方法，让真嗣和明日香恢复正常。

End of chapter 3. 第chapter章 完。

In the next chapter, the pilots have to face their school day. How will their schoolmates react to their different selfs?  
在下一章《一千零一夜》中，飞行员们必须面对他们的校园生活。他们的同学们会如何看待他们的不同自我呢？
