What if Shinji was able to find Asuka in that dead end bathtub?  
如果真嗣在那死胡同般的浴缸里找到了明日香，会怎样？

---

The metal is cold on her skin as she lays there. She doesn't know for how long, it doesn't matter. The days don't matter anymore.  
金属贴着她的肌肤，冰冷刺骨，她躺在那里，不知过了多久，也无所谓了。日子，已经不再重要。

Nothing matters. 一切都无关紧要。

Beside her on that chair her uniform is folded nicely. Tidy. The outward appearance she could no longer wear. The person she could no longer be.  
在她旁边的椅子上，她的制服整齐地叠放着。整洁。那是她再也无法穿上的外表，再也无法成为的人。

"What use am I, if I can't pilot the Eva?" She utters in between cracked lips.  
“如果我不能驾驶 Eva，那我还有什么用？”她透过干裂的嘴唇低声说道。

She had watched the clouds cycle overhead as time went on. She had her last drink hours prior. Now, she just waited.  
她看着云朵在天空中循环往复，时间悄然流逝。数小时前，她喝完了最后一杯。此刻，她只是静静等待。

"Idiot." She cursed, both at herself and at the one.  
“蠢货。”她咒骂道，既是对自己，也是对那个人。

She was dimly aware of the crunching of feet and a small gasp. She didn't have the energy, or will, to investigate who it was. It didn't matter. Nothing mattered.  
她隐约听见脚步的沙沙声和一声轻微的惊呼。她既没有力气，也没有意愿去探究那是谁。这无关紧要。什么都不重要了。

She stared into space as she was dimly aware of a man above her. He had been moving for several moments now but nothing had changed. A distant part of her wondered why anyone cared.  
她茫然地凝视着虚空，隐约感觉到一个男人在她上方。他已经移动了好一会儿，但一切似乎都未曾改变。她内心深处不禁疑惑，为何还有人会在意。

She was aware of her world shifting then as the clouds turned out of her vision. Like the discarded doll she became, she didn't need to turn her head or her eyes, as she was lifted with clumsy effort from that bathtub. A blanket had been thrown over her, too.  
随后，她感觉到自己的世界在变化，云层从她的视野中移开。就像被丢弃的玩偶一样，她无需转动头颅或眼睛，就被笨拙地从浴缸中抱起。一条毯子也被扔在了她身上。

Next she knew she had been dropped on the floor. Her vision was darkened, she could only see the roof of the building she had decided to pass in.  
接下来，她意识到自己被丢在了地板上。视线昏暗，她只能看到决定经过的那栋建筑的屋顶。

Then she was aware of something on her lips. Her head was being tilted. Water was against her lips that was sloshed into her mouth.  
随后，她感觉到唇上有异物。她的头被轻轻倾斜。水触碰到她的唇，被灌入她的口中。

She gagged and spit some of it out, but swallowed some. Her final drink had not been her last, after all.  
她呛了一下，吐出了一些，但还是咽下了一些。毕竟，她最后的饮水并非终结。

"Asuka…" the man's breath huffed over her.  
“明日香…”男人的气息拂过她的脸庞。

His tone, his voice, brought spikes of anger to the forefront. She knew who this was. She did not want to see him.  
他的语气，他的声音，激起了她心中的怒火。她知道这个人是谁。她不想见到他。

But she had no strength or will to care. Nothing mattered.  
但她已无力也无心去在乎。一切都无关紧要了。

"Asuka… Thank God I found you… I didn't know what to do before but… I'm here now. I-i won't leave you!"  
“明日香…感谢上帝我找到你了…之前我不知道该怎么办，但现在…我在这里。我-我不会离开你的！”

That was rich. He took every opportunity before to abandon and ignore her in the past, even when she was most vulnerable. Why would he come out to see her now…  
真是讽刺。他以前总是找机会抛弃和忽视她，即使在她最脆弱的时候也不例外。现在他怎么会突然出现来看她呢……

Wet hit her face. Drops, landing on her cheeks.  
雨水打在她的脸上，水滴落在她的脸颊上。

He was just feeling guilty.  
他只是感到内疚罢了。

More sobs. 又是哭泣声。

"I…I have no one else! I… I can't trust anyone else! Asuka, please… don't leave… don't leave me…"  
“我…我再也没有别人了！我…我无法信任其他人！明日香，求你了…别走…别丢下我…”

Anyone else would do. Why me over anyone else?  
换谁都行。为什么偏偏是我而不是别人？

"I'm sorry I didn't understand what you were trying to tell me! I'm such an idiot and a coward.  
"对不起，我没明白你想告诉我什么！我真是个傻瓜，还是个懦夫。

"Please come back to me, Asuka! I need you!"  
"请回到我身边，明日香！我需要你！"

She sucked in a breath of new life.  
她深吸了一口新生的气息。

What?

_Hours earlier. 数小时前。_

"I'm home!" Kodama said as she came through the front door of the Horaki home.  
“我回来了！”小田切进门时，对着堀木家的前门喊道。

Hikari answered from the kitchen, "Welcome home! You're back early."  
光从厨房回应道：“欢迎回家！你回来得真早。”

Kodama walked through the house towards the kitchen, taking off the apron she wore for her waitressing duties. "Azuma owed me a favor and I decided to collect. I think I've had enough of unreasonable, pushy people today."  
儿玉穿过屋子走向厨房，脱下了她作为服务员时穿的工作围裙。“东欠我一个人情，我决定今天来讨。我觉得我已经受够了今天那些无理取闹、咄咄逼人的人。”

"Mhm." Hikari replied in the kitchen as she paged through a cookbook.  
“嗯。”光在厨房里应了一声，同时翻阅着一本食谱。

Kodama had dropped her purse and listened. "No Asuka today?"  
小灵听到声音，放下手中的钱包，问道：“今天没有飞鸟吗？”

Hikari looked up. "She hasn't been here in a few days, haven't you noticed?"  
光抬头回应：“她已经好几天没来了，你没注意到吗？”

Kodama didn't answer immediately. She took two steps to the hallway before her sense of duty overcame her. "Hikari, I know It's not any of my business, but, is she all right?"  
小灵没有立刻回答，她走了两步到走廊，责任感驱使她停下脚步，“光，我知道这不关我的事，但是，她还好吗？”

Hikari looked up from the cookbook. "What do you mean?"  
光从食谱中抬起头来。“你什么意思？”

Kodama turned back to Hikari,and walked back into the kitchen. "Some of the things I saw about her made me worry, Hikari. Somethings wrong with her."  
小玉转回身面向光，并走回厨房。“我看到她的一些事情让我担心，光。她有些不对劲。”

Hikari dipped her head. "I know."  
光低下头。“我知道。”

"You knew? What are you doing about it?"  
"你知道了？你打算怎么办？"

"What can I do?" Hikari replied. "Kodama, they're Evangelion pilots. They're taken care of."  
"我能做什么？" 光回答道，"小玉，他们是福音战士的驾驶员，有人照顾他们。"

That answer didn't sit well. "What are you doing to make sure of that?"  
这个回答并不让人满意。"你采取了什么措施来确保这一点？"

Hikari closed the cookbook. "Kodama what would you have me do? Call NERV and check on Asuka like some desperate mother Hen?"  
光关闭了食谱。“木灵，你想要我怎么做？打电话给 NERV，像一个绝望的母鸡一样去查问明日香的情况吗？”

"Yes." Kodama replied. Stepping forward she said, "Hikari, you're class rep for your kids. That can mean you're the only one looking out for them. If they're skipping school and displaying obvious distress, the least you can do is call and see if they need help."  
“是的。”木灵回答道。她向前一步说：“光，你是班级的代表，这意味着你是唯一一个在关心他们的人。如果他们逃学并且表现出明显的困扰，你至少应该打个电话，看看他们是否需要帮助。”

Hikari's stare was distant. "Asuka doesn't need help."  
光的目光遥远。“明日香不需要帮助。”

"Has she told you that?"  
"她跟你说过那件事吗？"

"She didn't need to." "她不需要说。"

Kodama stepped forward again. "Has she tell you that?"  
木灵再次上前一步。“她跟你说过那件事吗？”

Blinking, she refocused on Kodama. "Why is it important?"  
"眨了眨眼，她重新将注意力集中在小玉身上。“为什么这很重要？””

Kodama closed her eyes to suck in a breath, before she opened them. "Hikari, I'm disappointed I have to remind you of this, but students display signals all the time that they don't put into words. Sometimes it's because they can't. Sometimes they don't know how to ask for help. You might be their only hope. It's not just your duty as a class rep, it's the responsible thing to do!"  
"小玉闭上眼睛深吸了一口气，然后睁开。“光，我很失望我不得不提醒你这一点，但学生们经常表现出他们没有用言语表达的信号。有时候是因为他们无法表达。有时候他们不知道如何寻求帮助。你可能就是他们唯一的希望。这不仅仅是作为班级代表的职责，这是负责任的行为！””

Hikari had been staring away, unable to look at her sister.  
"光一直盯着别处，无法直视她的姐姐。”

"Isn't Asuka your friend?" Kodama asked, "Aren't you her only friend?"  
"明日香不是你的朋友吗？" 儿玉问道，"难道你不是她唯一的朋友吗？"

"I CAN'T HELP HER!" Hikari blasted, "I CAN'T HELP ANY OF THEM!"  
"我帮不了她！" 光大声喊道，"我谁也帮不了！"

The silence rebounded in That moment as the sisters looked at one another, Hikari panting and on the verge of tears.  
那一刻，沉默在姐妹俩之间回荡，光喘着粗气，眼眶里泪水几欲夺眶而出。

She went on, "I can't help Ikari because he hides behind his SDAT, I can't help Ayanami because she's gone half the time! I can't… I couldn't help…" she trailed off, biting her lower lip as if to hold back the tears from spilling out of her eyes. One sniff and they started to come.  
她继续说道：“我帮不了碇，因为他总是躲在 SDAT 后面，我也帮不了绫波，因为她有一半时间都不在！我帮不了…我帮不了…”她声音渐弱，咬着下唇，仿佛在阻止泪水从眼中溢出。一声抽泣，泪水便开始涌出。

Kodama, watching this, felt clarity dawn across her like the sun. "You couldn't help Suzuhara, so you don't think you can help any of them."  
小珠看着这一切，感觉就像太阳升起一样，她的思绪变得清晰起来。“你帮不了铃原，所以你认为你帮不了他们中的任何一个。”

Hikari was crying now, leaning sideways to hit the counter with her hip. Her hands were on her face as she bawled into them.  
光现在哭了起来，侧身靠在柜台上，用臀部支撑。她的双手捂着脸，泪水在掌间流淌。

Kodama slowly approached her sister, then enveloped the girl in a hug. Hikari just cried harder into her sister's chest.  
小椋缓缓走向她的妹妹，然后紧紧地拥抱了她。光只是把头埋在姐姐的胸前，哭得更厉害了。

Kodama held her sister for a while until she had calmed down.  
小椋抱着妹妹，直到她平静下来。

"Just because you lost one battle, it doesn't mean the others aren't worth fighting." Kodama said to her sister. "You know what you need to do. I'll help you, okay?"  
“只是输了一场战斗，并不意味着其他的战斗不值得去争取。”小椋对妹妹说，“你知道你需要做什么。我会帮你的，好吗？”

"Okay." Hikari said with a sniff.  
"好的。" 光说，抽了抽鼻子。

---

Kodama Horaki's car pulled up to the red apartment building. "I'll be down here if you need anything." Kodama said.  
堀崎小玉的车停在了红色公寓楼前。"如果需要什么，我就在下面。" 小玉说。

"All right." Hikari answered. She had changed back into her school uniform, telling her sister it helped her focus. Only in this guise did she think she had the authority to push for what was needed and impose.  
"好的。" 光回答道。她已经换回了校服，告诉姐姐这有助于她集中注意力。只有在这种装扮下，她才认为自己有权威去推动所需并施加压力。

Hikari marched herself through the elevator and along the vacant hall to the Katsuragi residence. She recalled months before, arriving here simultaneously with Suzuhara and Aida only to discover Shinji and Asuka synch training. That had been a shock.  
光自己走进电梯，穿过空荡荡的走廊，来到葛城家。她回忆起几个月前，与铃原和相田同时到达这里，却发现真嗣和明日香正在进行同步训练。那真是令人震惊。

And now she was here again. She tapped the door chime and waited.  
现在她又来到了这里。她按了门铃，然后等待着。

A minute went by, and she tried again. She would have given up there, but something within her- the drive that formed the core of her dutifulness- insisted she try again.  
一分钟过去了，她又试了一次。她本想就此放弃，但内心深处——那构成她尽责核心的动力——坚持让她再试一次。

Half a minute after the third ring, just when she was about to give up, the door opened and a somber Shinji answered. He looked up. "C-class rep."  
第三声铃响半分钟后，正当她准备放弃时，门开了，一脸阴沉的真嗣应了门。他抬头看了一眼。“C 班班长。”

"Shinji." Hikari said, "Is Asuka home?"  
“真嗣。” 明日香说道，“明日香在家吗？”

Shinji blinked. "N-no… she isn't with you?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“不……她没和你在一起吗？”

An alarm rang in Hikari's mind. Immediately following was guilt… she had just assumed Asuka went home after her breakdown. She abandoned her charge and her friend.  
光的心中警铃大作。紧接着是愧疚……她刚刚还以为明日香在崩溃后回家了。她抛弃了自己的责任和朋友。

She had to make this right.  
她必须纠正这个错误。

"Shinji, she hasn't been at my house in nearly a week." She stepped forward, "Shinji, I think she's in danger. Where else could she have gone?"  
“真嗣，她已经快一个星期没来我家了。”她向前一步，“真嗣，我觉得她有危险。她还能去哪儿呢？”

Shinji blinked in surprise. Asuka? In trouble? But… "she… she was upset to hear that Kaji had died…"  
真嗣惊讶地眨了眨眼。明日香？遇到麻烦了？但是…“她…她听到加持先生去世的消息很难过…”

Hikari shook her head and advanced again. "Shinji, we need to find her!"  
光摇了摇头，再次上前。“真嗣，我们必须找到她！”

"Well…what if she's just at the base?"  
“嗯…如果她只是去了基地呢？”

"Can you call them? Now?"  
"你能现在给他们打电话吗？"

Shinji turned away, not wanting to deal with this. "I'll call tomorrow…"  
真嗣转过身去，不想处理这件事。“我明天再打……”

Hikari allowed herself a moment of astonishment. Seeing his reaction, coupled with the obvious behavior they had displayed in class together, established to Hikari one of the reasons Asuka had her breakdown. Her brows descended. "Now, Ikari."  
光让自己惊讶了一会儿。看到他的反应，再加上他们在课堂上一起表现出的明显行为，让光明白了明日香崩溃的一个原因。她的眉头紧锁。“现在，碇。”

He half turned in the entry. "W-why now?"  
他半转过身在入口处。“为-为什么是现在？”

Hikari advanced into the hall, angry. "Shinji Asuka is missing. She could be hurt, kidnapped, dead, or in distress. I am not leaving here until one of two things happen:" she held up her hand to count, "One; you contact the base and find out if Asuka is there or two; you come with me to look for her."  
光走进大厅，怒气冲冲。“真嗣，明日香失踪了。她可能受伤了，被绑架了，死了，或者处于困境中。我不离开这里，直到发生以下两件事之一：”她举起手来计数，“一；你联系基地，查明明日香是否在那里，或者二；你跟我一起去寻找她。”

Shinji walked down the hall, "What am I, her husband?"  
真嗣沿着走廊走去，“我算什么，她的丈夫吗？”

Hikari's fury overrode decorum. Three strides down the hall. One hand to spin him. The other hand to strike him with an open palm. Shinji collapsed backward, landing on his butt.  
光愤怒至极，顾不得礼仪。三步冲过走廊，一手将他转过来，另一手以掌心猛击。真嗣向后倒去，一屁股坐在地上。

"SHE LIKES YOU!" Hikari blasted at him.  
“她喜欢你！”光冲着他大声说道。

That got Shinji to look up, eyes focused on the class rep.  
这话让真嗣抬起头，目光紧盯着班长。

Hikari, fists balled and breath huffing, said, "She hid it behind innuendo and suggestion but we all saw it! She didn't give a damn about any other boy in school but you? She had speeches. The only reason any girl would obsess that much over someone is because she likes them!"  
光紧握着拳头，气喘吁吁地说：“她虽然用暗示和含蓄的方式隐藏，但我们大家都看出来了！她根本不在乎学校里的其他男生，只在乎你？她还有一大堆说辞。一个女孩对某人如此着迷，唯一的原因就是她喜欢那个人！”

Shinji stared at her, eyes still wide. "But… why… why didn't she just say that?"  
真嗣盯着她，眼睛依旧睁得大大的。“但是…为什么…她为什么不直接说出来呢？”

Hikari had a flash of insight- Her own relationship with Toji. Why she still hadn't spelled out directly to him that she liked him. _I'm not direct, either._  
光突然灵光一闪——她自己与东治的关系。为什么她还没有直接向他表明自己喜欢他。我也不是直接的人。

Deflating a little, Hikari answered, "It's because she wants a sign that you like her, too. She wanted to know if you felt the same way before taking a risk with her heart."  
稍微泄了点气，光回答道：“那是因为她想要一个你喜欢她的迹象。她想在冒险投入感情之前，知道你是否也有同样的感觉。”

Shinji, eyes still wide, was reevaluating every interaction he could remember with Asuka on the basis that she liked him and wouldn't admit it directly. He couldn't dismiss the notion being true.  
真嗣的眼睛依然睁得大大的，他正在重新评估自己能记得的与明日香之间的每一次互动，基于她喜欢他但不愿直接承认这一点。他无法排除这个想法是真的。

Hands in hips Hikari said, "You owe it to her to at least square with her if you don't like her. Right now, I need your help finding her so I can help her."  
双手叉腰，光说：“如果你不喜欢她，至少你应该坦诚面对她。现在，我需要你的帮助找到她，这样我才能帮助她。”

Shinji was blushing and looking away. "I… I never said I didn't like her."  
真嗣脸红着，目光移向别处。“我…我从没说过我不喜欢她。”

Hikari leaned forward. "Before anything involving a group project, you would always assume you were paired with Asuka. That wasn't us, that was you. You always had lunch ready for her and a ton of apologies ready if you missed one. We knew. We were just waiting for you to say something to her."  
光向前倾身。“在任何涉及小组项目的事情之前，你总是默认你会和明日香一组。那不是我们，那是你。你总是为她准备好午餐，如果你错过一次，就会准备一大堆道歉。我们都知道。我们只是在等你向她表白。”

Shinji slowly came to his feet. "I.. I'll help you find her." He said.  
真嗣缓缓站起身来。“我…我会帮你找到她的。”他说道。

---

Shinji's shock peaked into concern when he learned not only was she not quartered on the base, but Section Two was searching for her also. The image of her missing, hurt somewhere, was animating him into action. Especially with the Horaki sisters also being so animated to find her- it was easier to be part of the group directed on this effort. Guilt was also starting to bite at him that he might have had a part in letting this happen.  
当真嗣得知她不仅不在基地内，而且第二部门也在寻找她时，他的震惊转为担忧。她失踪、受伤的画面驱使他行动起来。尤其是堀越姐妹也如此积极地寻找她——加入这个集体行动变得更容易。内疚也开始啃噬他，或许他也有责任让这一切发生。

Twenty minutes later Shinji was sitting in the backseat of Kodama Horakis' car. Hikari, on Kodama's discreet suggestion, sat in the back so she could talk directly with Shinji.  
二十分钟后，真嗣坐在儿玉小田的车后座。在儿玉的隐晦建议下，光坐到后面，以便直接与真嗣交谈。

Calls to the city police and missing persons line turned up nothing. Nobody knew where she was, or where to start looking.  
向城市警察和失踪人口热线求助未果。没有人知道她在哪里，或者从哪里开始寻找。

"No…" Kodama said, "I might have an idea. North Hakone, near the hills. We can try there."  
"不…" 小玉说，"我可能有个主意。箱根北部，靠近山丘的地方。我们可以去那里试试。"

Shinji exchanged glances with Hikari. Hikari asked, "what makes you think it's there?"  
真嗣与光交换了一个眼神。光问道："你为什么认为那里会有线索？"

"It's a popular suicide spot." Kodama said, somber. "I've had to go looking there before, for missing students, when I was a class rep."  
"那里是个热门的自杀地点。" 小玉语气沉重地说，"我以前当班长时，曾为了寻找失踪的学生去过那里。"

They were silent for a time as Kodama started driving north. Shinji, ruminating on his encounters with Asuka, asked, "Um… this is stupid, but does anyone know what the Walls of Jericho are?"  
他们沉默了一会儿，随着小玉开始向北行驶。真嗣在反思与明日香的相遇时，问道：“嗯……这很蠢，但有人知道耶利哥城墙是什么吗？”

---

The decimated area was quiet as the three of them disembarked. The sun was starting to sink to the west.  
三人下车后，这片废墟之地静悄悄的。太阳开始向西沉去。

Kodama took a breath. "Police patrol this area frequently, but not constantly. If… if you see something, call out. Don't leave Asuka, unless…" Kodama left the rest unsaid.  
小玉深吸了一口气。“警察经常巡逻这个区域，但不是一直都在。如果……如果你看到什么，就大声喊。不要离开明日香，除非……”小玉没有把话说完。

The teens only nodded grimly.  
少年们只是严肃地点了点头。

Kodama squared her shoulders. "All right… I'll go west, Hikari, go east. Shinji, go north. Meet back here in-" she checked her watch, "a half hour."  
小玉挺直了肩膀。“好吧…我往西走，光，你往东。真嗣，你往北。半小时后在这里集合——”她看了看手表，“半小时后。”

Silently the three of them started going through the ruins.  
三人默默地开始在废墟中搜寻。

---

The second house Shinji investigated gave Shinji an odd feeling. He trudged closer, spotting a discarded water bottle on the ground that looked too new compared to the rest of the dirtitus here. The former two story house was almost completely blasted apart. He could see clear into the living room from the debris-covered street.  
真嗣调查的第二栋房子给他一种奇怪的感觉。他拖着沉重的步伐走近，发现地上有一个看起来与周围脏乱环境格格不入的废弃水瓶。这栋曾经的两层住宅几乎被完全炸毁。从满是瓦砾的街道上，他可以清楚地看到客厅内部。

He passed through what used to be the entry, went through the living room, and rounded the corner.  
他穿过曾是入口的地方，穿过客厅，然后拐了个弯。

He could look down what used to be a hallway. The straight shot into the bathroom showed Shinji a clawfoot tub on the far end. Someone was in it.  
他可以看到曾经是走廊的地方。直通浴室的视线尽头，真嗣看到了一个爪足浴缸。里面有人。

He stepped closer, horror and elation mixing in his gut as he came across the girl. His redhead lay in the tub, gaunt and pale, staring up at the ceiling. He gasped at the sight.  
他走近了，恐惧与狂喜在腹中交织，因为他发现了那个女孩。他的红发女孩躺在浴缸里，瘦弱而苍白，凝视着天花板。他看到这一幕，不禁倒吸一口凉气。

He couldn't help beginning to hyperventilate and stepped away to get some air. He had found her.  
他忍不住开始过度换气，后退几步去呼吸些新鲜空气。他找到了她。

He wanted to run. This… this was too much. Who was he that he could hope to help her? But… she was hurt. Badly. That is, if she wasn't dead…  
他想要逃跑。这……这太过了。他是谁，竟敢奢望能帮助她？但是……她受伤了，很严重。也就是说，如果她还没死的话……

He had to be sure.  
他必须确认清楚。

And… and if she wasn't, knowing now what he knew…  
而且…而且如果她不是，现在他知道了这些…

He crept up to the tub and examined the scene. Her clothes had been folded neatly and set on the chair beside the tub. That told him what he needed to know of her intentions…  
他悄悄走近浴缸，审视着现场。她的衣服被整齐地叠好放在浴缸旁的椅子上。这告诉他她意图的线索…

He got an eyeful looking at Asuka naked in the tub. It took a moment for him to realize what he was seeing and panicked, averting his eyes and blushing furiously. He took deep breaths, flashing back to the moment he tumbled onto Ayanami and his hand-  
他一眼瞥见了赤裸的明日香在浴缸里，愣了一会儿才意识到自己看到了什么，顿时慌了神，急忙移开视线，脸颊涨得通红。他深吸几口气，脑海中闪回着那次跌倒在绫波丽身上，手触碰到——

_Help her. 帮帮她。_

He couldn't leave Asuka. Especially now to suspect she had feelings for him, after all, made him consider his own.  
他无法抛下明日香，尤其是在怀疑她可能对自己有感情之后，这让他开始审视自己的心意。

He _wanted_ to help her.  
他想帮助她。

Thinking of their sync training together, jumping into the volcano to save her, and other times he had admired her fire and bravery, he searched the house for cloth to use. An old bed sheet was the best he could find. He shook this out and returned to her, then threw it on to the tub to cover her. Awkwardly he reached into the tub, hands going around cloth and skin as he pulled her up and out of the tub.  
回想起他们一起进行的同步训练，跳进火山救她，以及他曾钦佩她的热情和勇气，他在屋里寻找可以使用的布料。一条旧床单是他能找到的最好的东西。他抖开床单，回到她身边，然后将其抛到浴缸上以遮盖她。他笨拙地伸手进浴缸，双手穿过布料和皮肤，将她拉起来并带出浴缸。

Shinji glanced at her face. She was staring blankly, unresponsive like a doll, as he hauled her up out of the tub.  
真嗣瞥了一眼她的脸。她目光呆滞，像玩偶一样毫无反应，当他把她从浴缸里拉起来时。

In spite of being malnourished she was heavy. He only got as far as the covered part of the hall when he took a knee and was forced to drop her down.  
尽管她营养不良，却异常沉重。他仅勉强走到大厅的遮蔽处，便不得不单膝跪地，将她放下。

"Sorry…" he huffed and looked at her. Her head had rolled a little, dead eyes still staring off into space. Shinji noticed then that her lips were chapped.  
“对不起…”他喘着气，看向她。她的头微微侧转，无神的眼睛依旧凝视着虚空。这时，真嗣注意到她的嘴唇干裂。

She needed water. 她需要水。

Looking into the bathroom he saw an intact sink. He tried the faucet, prayed thanks that the plumbing worked, and cupped his hand to take some water. Returning to Asuka, he came down and reached his free hand behind her head.  
朝浴室里望去，他看到一个完好的洗手池。试着打开水龙头，庆幸管道还能用，便用手捧起水来。回到明日香身边，他蹲下身，用空着的手托起她的后脑勺。

It was eerie and unsettling for her eyes to be staring at nothing as he gently poured some of the water into her mouth. Her eyes bugged and she gagged. Shinji grasped, "oh no!"  
她那双眼睛空洞地望着虚空，他轻柔地将水倒入她口中，这情景诡异而令人不安。她的眼睛瞪大，开始呛咳。真嗣紧张地喊道：“糟了！”

But he saw her swallow, her breathing continued. The next blink was slow and lazy. He lowered her head back to the ground, emotion welling in him over the strongest girl in his existence- once so passionate and full of life, had been reduced to an almost lifeless out mannequin.  
但他看到她吞咽了下去，呼吸依旧。下一次眨眼缓慢而慵懒。他将她的头轻轻放回地面，心中涌起复杂的情感，眼前这个他生命中最坚强的女孩——曾经充满激情与活力，如今却沦为几乎无生命的仿真人偶。

He wondered then if the girl he had admired so much was gone forever. "Asuka…" he rasped.  
他那时疑惑，自己曾如此倾慕的女孩是否已永远离去。“明日香…”他嘶哑地唤道。

"Asuka… Thank God I found you…" Shinji had started speaking before he realized he was. "I didn't know what to do before but… I'm here now. I-i won't leave you!"  
“明日香…感谢上帝，我找到你了…”真嗣在意识到自己开口之前就已经开始说话了。“之前我不知道该怎么办，但现在…我在这里。我-我不会离开你！”

She continued to stare, her gaunt face agape while her eyes were focused on a far off point.  
她继续凝视着，瘦削的脸庞张着嘴，目光却聚焦在遥远的某一点上。

Leaning over her, seeing what she had become, he started to cry. "I…I have no one else! I… I can't trust anyone else! Asuka, please… don't leave… don't leave me…"  
俯身看着她，目睹她变成的样子，他开始哭泣。“我…我再也没有别人了！我…我无法信任其他人！明日香，求你了…别离开…别离开我…”

She was gone. The passionate firebrand, his combat partner and synch battle companion, was gone. She had been destroyed through attrition with the angel battles and isolation… and waiting on a cue from him that he never gave her.  
她已经离去。那个充满激情的斗士，他的战斗伙伴和同步战斗伴侣，已经离去。她在与天使战斗的消耗和孤立中被摧毁…还有等待他从未给予的信号。

Desperation rose in his neck as the image of her, fading and gone, loomed loud in his mind.  
绝望在他颈间升起，她的影像，逐渐消失且不复存在，在他脑海中显得格外清晰。

"I'm sorry I didn't understand what you were trying to tell me! I'm such an idiot and a coward. Please come back to me, Asuka! I need you!"  
"对不起，我没明白你想告诉我什么！我真是个傻瓜，还是个懦夫。请回到我身边，明日香！我需要你！"

He heard the huge intake of air from her and looked up.  
他听到她深吸一口气的声音，抬头望去。

Her blue eyes were trained on his gray now. In that second he was certain she was staring into his very being.  
她的蓝眼睛此刻正盯着他的灰色眼眸。那一刻，他确信她正凝视着他的灵魂深处。

Shinji swallowed. "I'll stay with you, I promise. Do you hear me? I promise!"  
真嗣咽了咽口水。“我会和你在一起，我保证。你听见了吗？我保证！”

A small voice cracked from between her lips. "I..d..i..o..t.."  
一个微弱的声音从她唇间挤出。“我..傻..瓜..”

Shinji screwed his face with resolve, and the he thought he heard his name. He turned around and blasted to the sky, "I FOUND HER! KODAMA! HIKARI! SHES HERE! SHES HURT!"  
真嗣紧绷着脸，决心已定，这时他似乎听到了自己的名字。他转身向天空疾呼：“我找到她了！小田！光！她在这里！她受伤了！”

---

Kodama had brought the first aid kit, but her cell phone was more valuable to call emergency services. Hikari waited by the road while Kodama waited with Shinji and Asuka. They tried two more times to get her to drink.  
小圆带来了急救包，但她的手机更有用，可以呼叫紧急服务。光在路边等待，而小圆则与真嗣和明日香一起等待。他们又尝试了两次让她喝水。

It took ten minutes for the ambulance to arrive. Shinji and Kodama stayed back as the paramedics did their job. Shinji, though, vectors in to be close to the stretcher as it headed for the truck. Shinji made it a point to make eye contact with Asuka once more before she was loaded into the back.  
救护车花了十分钟才到达。真嗣和小圆留在后面，让急救人员做他们的工作。然而，真嗣靠近担架，因为它正朝卡车方向移动。在明日香被抬进车后之前，真嗣特意再次与她进行了眼神交流。

One of the paramedics asked for his name and his relation to the patient.  
其中一名急救人员询问了他的名字以及他与患者的关系。

"Shinji Ikari, her roommate." He said definitively.  
“碇真嗣，她的室友。”他肯定地说道。

"Do you want to ride with Her?" The man asked.  
“你想和她一起骑车吗？”男人问道。

Shinji blinked with surprise and glanced at the Horaki sisters, standing a few paces away.  
真嗣惊讶地眨了眨眼，瞥了一眼站在几步之外的洞木姐妹。

It was Hikari who barked, "Go with her Ikari! She needs your help!"  
是光喊道：“跟她一起去，碇！她需要你的帮助！”

"I'll go." Shinji replied and boarded the ambulance.  
“我去。”真嗣回答着，登上了救护车。

The Horakis followed in Kodama's car.  
洞木一家则跟着在光的车里。

---

Things were a blur. 一切都是模糊的。

Shinji rode up front with the driver, as much as he wanted to be beside Asuka to see if she was all right. He rode in silence, only answering factual questions put to him by the paramedics.  
真嗣坐在司机旁边，尽管他很想坐在明日香旁边，看看她是否安好。他沉默地坐着，只对急救人员提出的实际问题作出回答。

When they arrived at the hospital he was able to see Asuka again on a stretcher as she was wheeled in. He could only travel with her so far- their eyes locked again only just before she passed through the doors.  
到达医院时，他再次看到了躺在担架上的明日香被推进去。他只能陪她走到这里——他们的目光再次锁定，就在她穿过门的那一刻。

Shinji had been waiting in the hospital lobby for close to a half hour now, hoping to hear anything. Noting the time, he realized that he wouldn't be home to make dinner. Not that Misato would mind much, consuming another instant curry pack-  
真嗣已经在医院大厅等待了近半个小时，希望能听到任何消息。注意到时间，他意识到自己无法回家做晚饭了。并不是说美里会很介意，再吃一包速食咖喱——

He shuddered as he recalled Misato's last attempt to talk to him in his bedroom. He did not want to go back home just now.  
他颤抖着回忆起美里上次在他卧室试图与他交谈的情景。他现在并不想回家。

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

His head lifted. Kodama was walking through the room, passing rows of seats in order to sit across from him. "Any word?" She asked after sitting down.  
他抬起头。儿玉正穿过房间，经过一排排座位，坐在他对面。“有消息吗？”她坐下后问道。

"No." Shinji replied. Realizing she was alone, Shinji asked, "Where's Hikari?"  
"不。" 真嗣回答道。意识到她独自一人，真嗣问道："日向在哪里？"

Nozomi smirked. "Part of the reason we're late is because we visited Suzuhara first."  
望美露出一丝坏笑。"我们迟到的一部分原因是因为我们先去拜访了铃原。"

Shinji's heart stopped as the guilt slammed into his mind. "Oh." He lowered his head.  
真嗣的心脏仿佛停止了跳动，罪恶感猛烈地冲击着他的思绪。"哦。" 他低下了头。

"Shinji, he wants to see you."  
"真嗣，他想见你。"

Shinji didn't look at Kodama. "Why? After what I did to him?"  
真嗣没有看向儿玉。“为什么？在我对他做了那些事之后？”

"Nah man," Toji's voice said, "So I can talk to you."  
"不是啦，兄弟，" 东治的声音说道，"所以我才能跟你谈谈。"

Shinji nearly got up out of his seat. Toji, advancing in a wheelchair, held up his hand for his friend to sit back down. "Shinji, stay put. I want to talk to you." He repeated.  
真嗣差点从座位上站起来。东治坐在轮椅上前进，举起手示意他的朋友坐下。“真嗣，别动。我有话要跟你说。”他重复道。

Shinji slumped down in his chair but looked at Hikari as she approached. "I'm sorry Shinji, I told him to wait, but he insisted." The class rep said.  
真嗣瘫坐在椅子上，但当班长光接近时，他看向了她。“对不起，真嗣，我让他等一下，但他坚持要过来。”班长说。

"Yeah, I did." Toji replied and looked at his friend. "Because I remember how you were with my sister and figured you would be hating yourself again for something you couldn't control."  
“是的，我坚持了。”东治回答，看着他的朋友。“因为我记得你对我妹妹的态度，我猜你又会因为无法控制的事情而自责。”

Shinji blinked and looked at Toji. "H-how did you know about-"  
真嗣眨了眨眼，看向东治。“你…你怎么知道关于-”

Toji thumbed to himself. "I got a debriefing. First and last one as a pilot. Miss Misato told me everything after the fact while I recovered. I won't go into details- classified stuff- but I know you had to make a hard choice and didn't want to do the tough thing. I gotta say, I appreciate you holding out on my behalf."  
东治指了指自己。“我接受了一次简报。作为驾驶员的第一次也是最后一次。事后我在恢复期间，美里小姐把一切都告诉了我。我不会透露细节——那是机密——但我知道你不得不做出艰难的选择，而且你并不想做那些艰难的事情。我得说，我很感激你为了我而坚持。”

Shinji stared at his hands. "If… if I were a stronger person… if I was just better, then everyone around me wouldn't be getting hurt because of my weakness."  
真嗣凝视着自己的双手。“如果…如果我是一个更坚强的人…如果我只是更好一些，那么我周围的人就不会因为我的软弱而受到伤害。”

"Right. If you were a comic book hero everything could be solved with a wave of your hand. But you're not, and real life is a lot harder than that. Besides, you think you're the only screw up? What about me, the guy actually in the cockpit of that thing? I had some agency, I put up a fight! The only reason I'm not tearing myself up about it is because these Angels are crazy powerful, and I'm lucky to get away with just losing a leg."  
"对。如果你是漫画书里的英雄，一切问题都能挥挥手解决。但你不是，现实生活比那难多了。再说，你以为只有你搞砸了吗？那我呢，那个真正坐在那东西驾驶舱里的人？我也有我的选择，我反抗过！我之所以没有为此撕心裂肺，是因为这些使徒太强大了，我能只失去一条腿就逃脱，已经算是幸运了。"

Shinji still looked down. Toji continued, "Another reason I came out here is because Hikari told me Soryu is in the hospital in a bad way. I came here to tell you to go see her."  
真嗣仍然低着头。东治继续说道："我之所以来这里，还有一个原因，是光告诉我明日香在医院情况很糟。我来这里是为了告诉你，去看看她吧。"

Shinji's head lifted. "W-why?"  
真嗣抬起头。"为-为什么？"

"Look, we kid about you two being newlyweds, but that's because we could all see that you care for one another. I remember how you tore yourself up about my sister, and I know that's why you didn't drop by to see me on your own. I don't want you to make the same mistake with her."  
"瞧，我们开玩笑说你们俩像新婚夫妇，那是因为我们都看得出来你们彼此关心。我记得你为了我妹妹自责的样子，我知道这也是为什么你没单独来看我。我不想你对她重蹈覆辙。"

Shinji smirked wryly. "I'm here, aren't I?"  
真嗣苦笑了一下。"我这不是来了吗？"

"Yeah," Toji replied, "You're in the waiting room. Not in the recovery room next to her. Don't weasel out with a technicality this time Ikari, go to her."  
"是啊，"东治回答，"你在候诊室里。而不是在她旁边的康复室。这次别用技术细节来逃避了，碇，去见她吧。"

Shinji's fists closed. "She… she…" Hikari's words in the hallway just earlier came back to him. He couldn't navigate around the _expectation_ that Asuka liked him. He had to find out, one way or another, where that was now. Because running away would only hurt her.  
真嗣握紧了拳头。“她…她…”早些时候在走廊里，Hikari 的话再次浮现在他脑海中。他无法回避 Asuka 可能喜欢他的期待。他必须弄清楚，无论如何，现在那感情的位置。因为逃避只会伤害她。

"Shinji Ikari?" A nurse asked. Shinji raised his head. "You can see Miss Langley now."  
“碇真嗣？”一位护士问道。真嗣抬起头。“你现在可以见 Langley 小姐了。”

The Horakis and Toji looked at Shinji expectantly. Shinji wasn't looking at them as he stood. "Oh…okay." slowly he walked for the door.  
洞木家的人和东治期待地看着真嗣。真嗣没有看他们，他站起身来。“哦…好的。”他缓缓地向门口走去。

Hikari, moved by a thought, called to him and hurried across the room. "Shinji!"  
光，被一个念头触动，呼唤着他并急忙穿过房间。“真嗣！”

They met halfway to the door into the hospital.  
他们在通往医院门口的半路上相遇。

Folding her hands in front of her she said, "Be honest with her, and yourself. Even if it's painful, it means you can turn the problem from feeling hurt into what to do about it. Nobody deserves to wait in misery, and sometimes you need someone else to lift you out of it. So…" she looked into Shinji's eyes, "promise me you'll be truthful with her, please?"  
她双手交叉在身前，说道：“对她，也对自己诚实。即使痛苦，这意味着你可以将受伤的感觉转化为如何解决问题。没有人应该在痛苦中等待，有时你需要别人来帮你摆脱困境。所以…”她凝视着真嗣的眼睛，“请答应我，你会对她坦诚，好吗？”

Shinji looked at her, but then also cast his gaze behind her. Kodama offered a wave. Toji offered a thumbs up.  
真嗣看着她，随后也将目光投向她身后。儿玉挥了挥手。东治竖起了大拇指。

_I'm not alone anymore_… Shinji realized. And after he left here, he knew he would be seeing more of these people. _I can run_ towards _others that help, not just_ away _from pain._  
我不再孤单了……真嗣意识到。离开这里后，他知道自己将会更多地见到这些人。我可以向那些给予帮助的人奔跑，而不仅仅是逃离痛苦。

Shinji looked back at Hikari. "I-i will." He said. Then he turned and walked towards Asuka.  
真嗣回头看向光。“我-我会。”他说道。然后他转身向明日香走去。

---

The beeping of the heart monitor pierced the silence of the white room. Shinji's shoes padded across the floor as he approached the bedside. The leather creaked as he sat in it. He stared at her. Her eyes were closed, but she was breathing. An IV was connected to her, other monitors were attached as well.  
心电监护仪的哔哔声刺破了白色房间的寂静。真嗣的鞋子轻轻踏过地板，他走近床边。坐下时，皮椅发出吱嘎声。他凝视着她。她的双眼紧闭，但呼吸尚存。一根静脉输液管连接着她，其他监测设备也已就位。

The image of her nudity flashed in his mind again, but he found he was more concerned with the wellbeing of the body before him. Of Asuka.  
她的裸体影像再次在他脑海中闪现，但他发现自己更关心眼前这个身体的安危。关心明日香。

Asuka. 阿苏卡。

He looked at her face. Though her eyes were closed and sunken, her face hollow and ashen, she still had the red pointed bangs, sharp nose, and long lashes he had noted since their first meeting. Even in this state, he found her beautiful.  
他注视着她的面庞。尽管她的眼睛紧闭且深陷，面容憔悴苍白，但她那红色的尖尖刘海、挺拔的鼻梁和长长的睫毛，自他们初次相遇起就让他印象深刻。即便在这样的状态下，他仍觉得她美丽动人。

And… and in all of that, he still hadn't said anything. She was unreachable, one to admire from across the river. He had never dared to wonder if it could be crossed.  
而…而在这一切中，他仍旧未发一言。她遥不可及，如同隔岸观花。他从未敢想象那条河是否能被跨越。

"Asuka… I… I'm glad you're safe now." Shinji said.  
“明日香…我…我很高兴你现在安全了。” 真嗣说道。

Nothing. 什么也没有。

Shinji sighed and looked down at his hands collected in front of him. What came to mind, he felt, was more spinning of wheels. He could apologize all he wanted, let his mouth run with words that he knew were insincere. He could make promises he never intended to keep.  
真嗣叹了口气，低头看着自己交叠在前的双手。他想到的，只觉得是徒劳的轮回。他可以不停地道歉，让那些他明知不真诚的话语从口中涌出。他可以许下从未打算遵守的承诺。

He stared at this girl, asking himself what he wanted here, now. Now that he knew she had been waiting for him, he brought himself here to cross the bridge. Now, alone with just the two of them, he dared to do it.  
他凝视着这个女孩，自问此刻他究竟想要什么。既然知道她一直在等他，他便带着自己来到这里，准备过桥。现在，只有他们两人独处，他敢于这么做。

He clenched his hands. The barrier was there, he could feel it. But he was also aware of the potential of pain, lingering behind that unknown. Hikari said that Asuka liked him- was that true?  
他紧握双手。那道屏障就在那里，他能感觉到。但同时，他也意识到未知背后潜藏的痛苦。光说明日香喜欢他——这是真的吗？

He had promised her- 他曾向她承诺——

_The volcano. 那座火山。_

_He had been listening over comms and watching the situation in his Eva. By reflex he had moved and jerked along with Asuka's movements as she attacked the Angel. Maybe it was out of some remnant of their sync training. Maybe it was just being a spectator to combat he could be fighting.  
他一直在通讯中听着，通过他的 Eva 观察着战况。出于本能，他随着明日香攻击使徒的动作而移动和抽搐。也许是他们同步训练的残留影响。也许只是作为一个旁观者，看着一场他本可以参与的战斗。_

_But then the cable was cut. In those seconds, within his mind, he imagined Asuka plummeting into the depths of the lava. She would sink deeper and deeper, the pressure eventually overcoming her suit, and smashing her. The light of the sun would never again hit her face. She would never breathe air, or see the sky again.  
但随后电缆被切断了。在那几秒钟内，他的脑海中想象着明日香坠入熔岩深渊的情景。她会越沉越深，压力最终会压垮她的装甲，将她粉碎。阳光将再也不会照到她的脸上。她将再也无法呼吸空气，或再次看到天空。_

_He could never tell her how he felt.  
他永远无法告诉她他的感受。_

_He stepped off the ravine and plunged into the lava to stop that future from happening.  
他跳下峡谷，跃入熔岩之中，只为阻止那个未来的发生。_

"Hikari… Hikari told me you liked me. She said you thought a lot about me… not anybody else. I… I came to say that… I.. I like you too."  
光…光告诉我你喜欢我。她说你经常想到我…不是别人。我…我来是想说…我…我也喜欢你。

The heart monitor increased the pace a bit but Shinji didn't listen. He looked at his hands as his thoughts spiraled.  
心率监测器加快了节奏，但真嗣并未在意。他看着自己的双手，思绪开始盘旋。

"I wanted you to know at least before anything else happened or anything else came apart. I… I like you. I… I think It started on that day you ran away from the sync training and I saw how dedicated you were to beating everyone. There are days I thought you were…. You were pretty cool!" He laughed.  
"至少在发生其他事情或任何东西再次破碎之前，我想让你知道。我…我喜欢你。我…我想是从那天你逃避同步训练，我看到你多么执着于打败所有人开始的。有些日子我觉得你…你真的很酷！" 他笑了。

The serenity of the white room, coupled with the monitor beeping, evaporated his good humor. He settled back in his seat.  
白色房间的宁静，伴随着监测器的嘟嘟声，消散了他的好心情。他重新坐回椅子上。

"I… I want the invincible Asuka back. I'd trade away my sync scores… instantly… to have things the way they were before. When we worked together to defeat the Angels, when I made lunch for you, and we'd walk to school together! I miss knowing that I could count on you to be strong. Even if we couldn't get out of whatever was happening, I knew at least you'd be there! And you wouldn't go out without a fight!"  
"我…我想要那个无敌的明日香回来。我愿意立刻用我的同步率去交换…换回以前的样子。那时我们一起打败使徒，我为你做午饭，我们一起走去学校！我怀念那种可以依靠你变得坚强的感觉。即使我们无法摆脱所发生的一切，至少我知道你会在那里！而且你不会不战而退！"

He was at the edge of his seat now and looked up. Her eyes were still closed, but her head had tilted in his direction.  
他此刻坐在椅子的边缘，抬头望去。她的眼睛依旧闭着，但头已经朝他的方向倾斜。

He settled back into his chair, at a loss of what more to say. He thought back over their interactions and meetings. And some of the things he discussed with the Horaki sisters.  
他重新靠回椅背，不知该再说些什么。他回想起他们之间的互动和会面。还有他与洞木姐妹讨论的一些事情。

"I… I learned what the walls of Jericho were."  
"我…我明白了耶利哥城墙的含义。"

Her eyes cracked open and focused on him. He was looking down.  
她的眼睛微微睁开，聚焦在他身上。他正低头看着她。

"At first I thought, 'why would she protect herself with a wall that's destroyed by trumpets and shouting? Did she want me to shout at her?' But… maybe it's more basic than that. Maybe you just wanted me to talk to you. And… knowing what I know now, it makes sense, especially with the training we were doing. I-i was nervous too. But I thought you were tough and didn't want distractions, even though later I was surprised when you-"  
"起初我在想，'为什么她要用会被号角和呐喊摧毁的墙来保护自己？难道她希望我向她大喊吗？'但是…也许这比那更基本。也许你只是希望我能和你交谈。而且…以我现在所知，这很有道理，特别是考虑到我们正在进行的训练。我-我也很紧张。但我认为你很坚强，不希望有任何干扰，尽管后来当你-"

He looked up then, and saw her looking at him. Elation burst in his heart, but temperance quickly followed. How much had she heard? What was she thinking?  
他抬头望去，发现她正注视着他。喜悦在心中迸发，但随即被克制所取代。她听到了多少？她在想什么？

The two stared at one another for a long moment.  
两人对视良久。

Shinji looked down, searching for words. He needed to pick the right ones, something to project what he felt. After another moment, he asked, "Can I…stay here a while, beside you?"  
真嗣低下头，寻找着合适的言辞。他需要挑选恰当的话语，表达自己的感受。片刻后，他问道：“我……能在这里待一会儿吗，就在你旁边？”

"Y.e.s..." She uttered. "是的..." 她低声说道。

Shinji scooted the chair closer to her. Looking at her on the bed, he saw her fingers twitch.  
真嗣将椅子挪近她。看着躺在床上的她，他注意到她的手指微微抽动。

He shook his head a little. He was already far beyond his comfort zone but she hadn't pushed back. Maybe… maybe it was okay.  
他轻轻摇了摇头。他早已超出了自己的舒适区，但她并没有抗拒。或许…或许这样也可以。

"Can… can I hold your hand, Asuka?"  
"可以…可以握住你的手吗，明日香？"

The heart monitor beeped at an uptick.  
心率监测器发出加快的哔哔声。

"Y.e.s..." She uttered again.  
"好…好的…" 她再次低声说道。

---

Hikari wheeled Toji down the hall back to his recovery ward ten minutes later. Kodama remained in the waiting room for Shinji.  
十分钟后，光推着东治沿着走廊回到了他的康复病房。小田则留在等候室陪伴真嗣。

Hikari was wrestling with what she needed to say to Toji. If she could make Shinji promise to be honest, she should follow suit, too.  
光正在纠结她需要对东治说些什么。如果她能让真嗣承诺保持诚实，她也应该同样做到。

Toji spoke, "I need to get out of here so I can knock some sense into those knuckleheads. How's Kensuke?"  
"东治开口道：“我得离开这里，好去给那些榆木脑袋敲敲警钟。健介怎么样了？””

That snapped Hikari back to the present. "Oh! He's fine, maybe a bit sad with the two of you gone. But everything's felt sad recently… so many things are coming apart."  
那一声让光回到了现实。“哦！他没事，可能因为你们俩不在而有点难过。但最近一切都感觉很悲伤……很多事情都在分崩离析。”

"That definitely means I need to get out of here."  
“那肯定意味着我需要离开这里。”

"Toji." Hikari said, stopping the wheelchair. They were alone in the hallway.  
"“东治。”光说着，停下了轮椅。他们独自在走廊里。”

Toji turned his head. He knew something was coming and had an idea what. "Yea, class rep?"  
东司转过头。他预感到有什么事情要发生，而且心里大概有数。“怎么了，班长？”

"I… I…" "我…我…"

Toji, smiling, looked forward again. "If it's something important, you can say it to my face, you know."  
东司微笑着再次向前看去。“如果是重要的事情，你可以当面告诉我，你知道的。”

"I… I can't." "我…我不行。"

"Just try it." Toji said.  
"试试看嘛。" 东治说道。

"O-ohkay um…" she rounded the wheelchair and looked at him. He looked back with a small grin on his face.  
"好-好吧，嗯…" 她绕过轮椅，看着他。他回望过来，脸上带着一丝微笑。

Her nerve was flagging, but… if Shinji could muster the strength, she could, too. "I… I offered to share lunches… that… that wasn't just because we had excess. I… I like you, too. A-and-" she flushed, "I wanted to be closer to you."  
她的勇气正在消退，但是……如果真嗣能鼓起力量，她也能。“我……我提出分享午餐……那……那不仅仅是因为我们有多余的。我……我也喜欢你。还……还有——”她的脸颊泛红，“我想和你更亲近一些。”

Toji's smile was holding.  
东治的笑容依旧挂着。

Hikari blinked. "You… you knew?"  
光眨了眨眼。“你……你知道？”

"You came all the way to visit me at the hospital with big excuses. Not even Kensuke dropped by, you know that? I had an idea I knew how you felt."  
"你大老远找借口来医院看我。连健介都没来过，你知道吗？我大概猜到你的心意了。"

Hikari looked down, still blushing. Toji reached over with a hand to nudge her gently, getting her to look up. He smiled at her. "You can be adorable when you're bashful."  
光低下头，依旧脸红。东治伸手轻轻碰了碰她，让她抬头。他对着她微笑。"你害羞的时候真可爱。"

"Idiot." She said, nervously kicking a foot.  
"笨蛋。"她紧张地踢了踢脚。

Toji, still smiling, leaned back in his wheelchair. "What do you say, when I'm discharged, let's do something together. I've been thinking a lot since I've been on bedrest, and I really want udon."  
东次依旧微笑着，靠在轮椅上。“你说怎么样，等我出院了，我们一起去做点什么吧。自从卧床休息以来，我思考了很多，真的很想吃乌冬面。”

"Udon?" “乌冬面？”

"Yeah some good, hot udon. Whaddya say, class rep, we make a date if it. Deal?"  
“对，来点热腾腾的好乌冬面。你说呢，班长，我们约个时间怎么样？成交吗？”

Hikari laughed, then set her face, determined. "Deal."  
光笑了笑，随即面露坚定之色。“成交。”

"All right. Now get me back to my room so they can discharge me faster."  
“好吧。现在快把我送回房间，这样他们就能早点让我出院了。”

Hikari laughed again as she maneuvered behind Toji to push him.  
光再次笑了起来，她绕到东二身后推着他前进。

"I wonder," Toji said, "if Shinji might be brave enough to go double dating with Soryu and us."  
"我在想，" 东治说，"真嗣会不会有勇气和索琉还有我们一起去双人约会。"

"That might be fun." Hikari admitted.  
"那应该挺有趣的。" 光承认道。

Toji nodded, then added in a low tone, "the guy needs friends he can trust to look out for him. He's the kind of guy who needs propping up."  
东治点了点头，然后压低声音补充道："那家伙需要一些可以信赖的朋友来关照他。他是那种需要支持的人。"

---

She was comfortable now. The clothing was soft and warm against her skin. The sting of the IV needle was long gone, and the sucker pads of instruments had warmed up enough against her body now that she didn't feel them. Life was slowly starting to return to her body, She was moving away from the abyss.  
她现在感到舒适。衣物柔软而温暖，紧贴着她的肌肤。静脉注射针的刺痛早已消失，仪器吸盘也因紧贴身体而变得温暖，不再让她感到不适。生命正缓慢地回归她的身体，她正从深渊中抽离。

She could feel the otherness of Shinji's hand on top of hers. The slight clamminess and texture of his palm and fingers on top of her hand was a constant reminder of his presence. She both craved it and loathed it being there at the same time.  
她能感受到真嗣的手覆盖在她手上的异样感。他手掌和手指的微湿与纹理不断提醒着他的存在。她既渴望又厌恶这种感觉。

At the end of all things, when she was ready to slip away, He was there. She did not know how or why, but every step of moving towards this bed and rising back to life, Shinji was present. It was baffling for someone to be so aloof to now suddenly be so involved. The universe had answered her accusation that she was unwanted by providing her the person she had been trying and failing to get the attention of.  
在一切的尽头，当她准备悄然离去时，他就在那里。她不知道为什么，但每一步走向这张床，重新回到生活的过程中，真嗣都在场。一个原本冷漠的人突然如此投入，令人困惑。宇宙回应了她被遗弃的指控，给了她一直努力却未能引起注意的那个人。

And he wanted to stay.  
而他想要留下。

It all made sense when he started to speak freely. As he rambled on while she lay there, listening, eventually she opened her eyes out of numb astonishment about the Walls of Jericho. It surprised her that not only did Shinji miss the reference, but that she had unwittingly given a reference that he couldn't possibly read. What had she wanted to accomplish? She wasn't in university anymore, surrounded by know-it-alls constantly judging a minor in their ranks. She was communicating to a high schooler- a peer now only in age.  
当他开始自由地说话时，一切都变得合理了。他滔滔不绝地说着，而她躺在那里听着，最终她因为对耶利哥城墙的麻木惊讶而睁开了眼睛。她惊讶的是，不仅真嗣没有理解这个典故，而且她无意中提到了一个他根本无法读懂的典故。她到底想达到什么目的？她已经不在大学里了，周围不再有一群自以为是的家伙，总是对圈子里的一个小角色评头论足。她现在是在和一个高中生交流——现在只是年龄上的同龄人。

How did she think any of her signaling was supposed to succeed, if he was this oblivious?  
如果他如此迟钝，她怎么指望自己的任何暗示能成功呢？

"Mr Ikari." The nurse said from the door, "Two minutes."  
"伊吹先生。" 护士站在门口说道，"两分钟。"

"Okay." Shinji said. Asuka cracked her eyes open to look at the boy again, and his stupid hair and stupid eyes. She had told herself the soul was what she was really interested in, not appearance, though Kaji's had been sublime in both. But she had to admit to herself now, Shinji was kind of cute.  
"好的。" 真嗣说道。明日香微微睁开眼睛再次看向那个男孩，还有他那愚蠢的头发和愚蠢的眼睛。她曾告诉自己，真正吸引她的是灵魂，而非外表，尽管加持先生的外表和灵魂都堪称完美。但她现在不得不承认，真嗣其实有点可爱。

"I-i have to go." He said to her, "I don't want to, i-i want to stay here until you get better."  
"我...我得走了。" 他对她说，"我不想走，我...我想留在这里直到你好起来。"

Her blink was slow, mouth still agape.  
她眨眼的动作缓慢，嘴巴依旧张着。

"I… I'll check on you when I can. I promise."  
“我…我会尽量来看你。我保证。”

"I.d.i.o.t ... s.h.i.n.j.i." Her voice cracked.  
“笨…蛋…新…二。”她的声音哽咽了。

Shinji looked into her eyes.  
真嗣凝视着她的眼睛。

"D..o.n't p..r.o.m.i..s.e .u.n.l.e.s..s ...y.o..u m..e...a..n ..i..t..."  
“别……承……诺，除非……你……真……心……”

She watched him draw himself up, serious now. "I do." He said, in tones she had never heard from him before. "I'm not going to lose you."  
她看着他挺直身躯，此刻显得严肃。“我会的。”他说，语气是她从未从他那里听过的。“我不会失去你。”

The door opened and Asuka closed her eyes. She felt Shinji's hand on hers a moment longer before it left, and she heard the patting of his feet leave the room.  
门开了，明日香闭上了眼睛。她感觉到真嗣的手在她的手上停留了一会儿才离开，随后听到了他脚步声离开房间的声音。

The door closed again, leaving her alone. She let her eyelids fully close again, permitting sleep to find her if it willed.  
门再次关闭，留下她独自一人。她再次完全闭上眼睑，任由睡意降临，如果它愿意的话。

It was pathetic. Her reason for living now was because one boy- stupid Shinji- believed in her. And her shredded pride was already latching on to this fantasy of what she used to be as a nudge to keep on living. She would prove to him that she was the strong, fighting spirit that he believed her to be.  
真是可悲。她现在活着的理由，仅仅是因为一个男孩——愚蠢的真嗣——相信她。而她那破碎的自尊已经紧紧抓住了这个关于她曾经是谁的幻想，以此作为继续活下去的推动力。她要向他证明，她就是他所相信的那个坚强、战斗不息的灵魂。

Sad as it was, it was more than anyone else here had done for her. Not Misato, not Hikari. And he was here every step of the way to make sure she would be back.  
尽管悲伤，但这比这里的任何人都为她做的要多。不是美里，也不是光。而他一直在这里，确保她会回来。

She was going to try.  
她打算尝试一下。

Kodama was still in the waiting room when Shinji emerged. It was dark outside. Pen Pen would probably be famished. Shinji said nothing as he walked over to the chairs and dropped into the one next to Kodama.  
当真嗣出现时，小田还在候诊室里。外面天已经黑了。企鹅可能已经饿坏了。真嗣一言不发地走到椅子旁，坐在小田旁边的椅子上。

"How is she?" Hikari's older sister asked him.  
"她怎么样了？" 光的大姐问他。

"She's okay." Shinji said, "I… I said a lot of things. She didn't talk much."  
"她还好。" 真嗣说，"我…我说了很多。她没怎么说话。"

"Did you tell her how you felt?"  
"你告诉她你的感受了吗？"

"I did." "我确实这么做了。"

"How did that go?" "那进展如何？"

"I…" He held up the hand that had touched her. "She let me hold her hand."  
"我……" 他举起曾触碰她的那只手，"她让我握了她的手。"

Kodama smiled. "That sounds like a positive sign to me."  
Kodama 微笑着说：“这对我来说是个好兆头。”

Shinji closed the hand he had raised. "I want to keep coming back here until she's well again."  
Shinji 合上了他举起的手。“我想一直来这里，直到她康复。”

"I think that's certainly possible, unless they move her. You'll have to ask NERV… doesn't your guardian work for them?"  
“我想这完全有可能，除非他们把她转移。你得去问 NERV……你的监护人不就在那里工作吗？”

Shinji shuddered. 真嗣打了个寒颤。

Kodama turned her head. "I saw that. Do you have a problem with your guardian?"  
儿玉转过头来。“我看到了。你对你的监护人有意见吗？”

"I… no… it's ok." “我…不…没事。”

Kodama blinked, "Shinji… forgive me, but this entire afternoon resulted from missed signals and domestic trouble. While you aren't strictly my responsibility, you're a good kid, and you're one of my Hikari's classmates. If you need help, Hikari and I are prepared to do anything we can.  
"木灵眨了眨眼，“真嗣…请原谅我，但今天下午这一切都是因为误解和家庭纷争。虽然你严格来说不是我的责任，但你是个好孩子，也是我女儿光的同学。如果你需要帮助，光和我都愿意尽我们所能。”

"You don't have to elaborate. What I only want to know is if you feel safe going home."  
你不必详细说明。我只想知道的是，你是否觉得回家安全。

Shinji tossed this question in his mind. Was he in danger? No. Misato wouldn't hurt him, he knew…  
真嗣在心中反复思考这个问题。他是否处于危险之中？不，他知道，美里不会伤害他…

_This is all that I can do right now-  
目前我能做的只有这些了——_

He seized up in the chair. "No…!" He uttered, "I… I don't."  
他在椅子上僵住了。“不…！”他脱口而出，“我…我不。”

Kodama took in a breath, then let it out. "Okay." She said, and locked eyes with Hikari as she came back from the back of the hospital.  
儿玉深吸一口气，然后缓缓呼出。“好吧。”她说着，与从医院后面回来的光对视。

That night proved pivotal. By the end of the night, Shinji was spending the night in Hikari's room,,while the class rep roomed with her older sister. He wasn't sure if or when he would be back at Misato's place.  
那一夜至关重要。夜幕降临时，真嗣在光房间过夜，而班长则与她的姐姐同住。他不确定自己是否还会回到美里家，也不知何时能回去。

An argument with Mr. Horaki, several calls to acquaintances and NERV housing later, Kodama and Hikari finished the effort of getting help for Shinji and Asuka. He would spend the night here, then begin residing on the base proper. Asuka was also transferring to the base's care facilities, where at least they'd be close together. It had been a full evening.  
与堀木先生的争执，几通联系熟人和 NERV 住宿的电话后，儿玉姐妹终于为真嗣和明日香争取到了帮助。真嗣将在这里过夜，然后正式入住基地。明日香也将转入基地的护理设施，至少他们能彼此靠近。这是一个忙碌的夜晚。

At the end of it, Hikari entered the door of the darkened room where Shinji had been laying. Shinji, listening to a borrowed CD player, popped the headphones out. "Class rep."  
夜深人静时，光走进了真嗣所在的昏暗房间。真嗣正用借来的 CD 机听着音乐，听到动静便摘下了耳机。“班长。”

"Shinji, call me Hikari." The girl said. The room was dark, but the illumination from the hall cast her figure in half orange shadow. She asked him, "Do you need anything before we call it a night?"  
"真嗣，叫我光就好了。" 女孩说道。房间很暗，但走廊的灯光将她的身影投射成半边橙色的影子。她问他："在我们结束今晚之前，你还需要什么吗？"

"I think I'm okay… but… I wanted to say thank you. For… for doing what you did. I had no idea about… about anything with Asuka."  
"我想我没事……但是……我想说谢谢你。为了……为了你所做的一切。我之前完全不知道……关于明日香的事情。"

Hikari's hand dropped from the doorway. "It never occurred to us that you didn't know about her feelings, Shinji. I'm just glad we could help Asuka."  
光的双手从门框上垂下。"我们从未想过你不知道明日香的感情，真嗣。我很高兴我们能帮助到明日香。"

"Me too." Shinji said. "我也是。" 真嗣说道。

Hikari bid Shinji goodnight and laid down on this borrowed bed. The same bed, he figured, Asuka had slept in almost a week ago before her breakdown.  
光向真嗣道了晚安，躺在了这张借来的床上。他猜想，这同一张床，明日香大约在一周前崩溃前曾睡过。

_She liked me this whole time._ Shinji ruminated. Eventually, he drifted off to sleep.  
她一直都喜欢我。真嗣沉思着。最终，他渐渐进入了梦乡。

The gray-haired facsimile finally stopped humming and looked up. The smattering of immortal stars glared down at him.  
那灰白头发的复制品终于停止了嗡鸣，抬头望去。零星的永生之星正俯视着他，光芒刺眼。

"I see." Kaworu said and stood up on the headless statue. "So, he did not come out this time."  
“我明白了。”薰站在无头雕像上说道，“看来，这次他并没有出来。”

Looking across the lights of Lake Ashi, Kaworu said to the air, "You're so far off the beaten path this time, Shinji. Where have you gone?"  
眺望着芦之湖畔的灯火，薰对着空气说道：“这次你真是偏离了常轨，真嗣。你究竟去了哪里？”

_Fin._

_A/N: This story spawned out of a small comic on the Asushin reddit where Shinji swaps places with Asuka at the end of Rebuild 3.0. I wanted to craft a story where Shinji works to take care of a comatose Asuka. Going by way of getting the Horaki's help ended up sending Asuka to the hospital instead of seeing Shinji labor over this effort.  
作者的话：这个故事源于 Asushin reddit 上的一个小漫画，其中在 Rebuild 3.0 的结尾，真嗣与明日香互换了位置。我想创作一个故事，讲述真嗣努力照顾昏迷中的明日香。原本打算通过寻求洞木家的帮助，结果却将明日香送进了医院，而不是看到真嗣为此付出的努力。_

_I'm the kind of writer who likes to set up the conditions of a situation and let it play out in my head. What I started was not what I intended to write, but this was the result of two days of jamming on it.  
我这种类型的作者喜欢设定情境的条件，然后在大脑中让它自然发展。我开始的并非我原本打算写的，但这是两天密集构思的结果。_

_I may take another stab at the premise, but I thought I'd publish what resulted out of my first try. I'm shaky that Shinji would turn around this quickly and dedicate himself to finding and healing Asuka, but playing out an equivocating Shinji would take more time and need more coverage than I wanted to put into the story. I think this serves for now. The timeline is also wonky because I couldn't decide where these events occur.  
我可能会再次尝试这个前提，但我想先发布我第一次尝试的成果。我对于真嗣能这么快转变并致力于寻找和治愈明日香感到有些不稳，但描绘一个犹豫不决的真嗣需要更多的时间和篇幅，这超出了我打算投入这个故事的范围。我认为目前这样已经足够。时间线也有些混乱，因为我无法决定这些事件发生的具体位置。_
