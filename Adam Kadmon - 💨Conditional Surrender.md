She woke after her alarm. She felt stone-heavy, the cheap college mattress struggling to support her weight. Which made her feel fat. Asuka got out of bed.  
她被闹钟唤醒。感觉自己沉重如石，廉价的大学床垫难以承受她的重量，这让她觉得自己很胖。明日香起床了。

Bleary eyes searched the dim room. She found one of his discarded shirts, but not him. She shrugged into it, yawned, and opened the door to the dormitory hall.  
睡眼惺忪地环视昏暗的房间。她找到了他丢弃的一件衬衫，但他人不在。她耸肩穿上，打了个哈欠，打开了通往宿舍走廊的门。

Her mother insisted she live the realest university experience possible; student housing, roommates, and a crippling lack of deferential behavior for her greatness included. Which was all bullshit, Asuka felt. What was the point of being special if you didn't get special treatment?  
她母亲坚持让她体验最真实的大学生活；学生宿舍、室友，以及对她伟大之处的缺乏敬意都包括在内。明日香觉得这些都是胡扯。如果不能得到特殊待遇，那么与众不同又有什么意义呢？

She found her boyfriend at the floor's kitchen area. Technically, he had no right to wander around a girl's dorm at this hour in his underwear but no one was complaining. Certainly not the pair of blushing sluts chatting him up by the microwave.  
她在楼层的厨房区找到了她的男朋友。严格来说，他在这个时间穿着内裤在女生宿舍闲逛是没有权利的，但没有人抱怨。当然，那对在微波炉旁搭讪他的脸红荡妇肯定不会。

The girls spotted Asuka's approach and ducked away down a hall after a hasty farewell. She dismissed the incident in a moment. Kaworu Nagisa didn't possess a wandering eye; he was just too damn friendly.  
女孩们注意到明日香的到来，匆匆告别后便沿着走廊溜走了。她立刻将这件事抛诸脑后。渚薰并没有四处留情的习惯；他只是太过友善了。

Kaworu was at the counter, gracefully fumbling with the coffeemaker. After all their years together he still didn't know how to make it properly. She hip-checked him to the side and took over.  
渚薰在吧台前，优雅地摆弄着咖啡机。尽管他们在一起这么多年，他还是不知道怎么正确地做咖啡。她用臀部轻轻撞开他，接手了这项工作。

"Good morning to you, too," he said.  
“你也早安，”他说。

"I appreciate your efforts and love you for it," Asuka meant to say. "Glarblefarb," was what came out.  
“我很感激你的努力，也爱你为此所做的一切，”明日香本想说。“格拉布尔法布，”结果却说成了这样。

Somehow, he translated. "Sleep well?"  
不知怎么的，他理解了。“睡得好吗？”

She grumbled. He should know by now not to engage until a heap of caffeine was coursing through her bloodstream. He seemed to remember and made genial small talk by himself as the coffee percolated.  
她咕哝着。他现在应该知道，在她血液里流淌着大量咖啡因之前，不要和她搭话。他似乎记得这一点，便独自和善地闲聊起来，而咖啡正在滴滤。

"I hope your roommate isn't too inconvenienced by my staying overnight," he said. "Actually, I haven't seen Ms. Ibuki in days. I don't frighten her, do I?"  
“希望我的留宿没有给你的室友带来太多不便，”他说道。“实际上，我已经好几天没见到伊吹小姐了。我不会吓到她吧？”

She rolled her eyes. Of course not. Androphobic Maya simply loved bunking in the labs. Drip, drip, drip went the coffeemaker. Sniff, sniff, sniff went Asuka.  
她翻了个白眼。当然不会。恐男症的玛雅只是喜欢在实验室里打地铺。咖啡机滴答滴答地响着。明日香则不停地嗅着。

"Then she must be absorbed in helping Professor Akagi again," Kaworu mused. "It's a lot to do so while still studying for her own degree. She's admirably responsible."  
"那么她一定又在帮助赤城教授了，"渚薰沉思道。"在攻读自己学位的同时还要做这么多事，她真是令人敬佩地负责任。"

Those who can't, help. Or in Maya's case, facilitate Akagi's sense of superiority. Bootlicker. Drip, drip, drip. Sniff, sniff, sniff.  
那些做不到的人，就帮忙。或者在真希波的例子中，助长赤城的优越感。马屁精。滴答，滴答，滴答。嗅嗅，嗅嗅，嗅嗅。

"It might be admirable to help her out." One look was enough for him to gracefully course correct down a different path. "Tutoring has worked out better than I imagined."  
"帮助她可能是值得敬佩的。"一个眼神就足以让他优雅地调整方向，走上另一条路。"辅导的效果比我预想的要好得多。"

Drip, sniff. Drip, sniff.  
滴答，嗅。滴答，嗅。

"Although the overabundance of female applicants don't seem to truly need the extra help, and are easily distracted."  
“尽管大量女性申请者似乎并不真正需要额外帮助，而且很容易分心。”

Asuka greedily sucked down three mouthfuls of black coffee. Language software reinstalled.  
明日香贪婪地喝下三口黑咖啡。语言软件重新安装。

Only he wouldn't question their motivations for learning under Nagisa-sensei. "At least we can agree its horrible dealing with dumb girls." She paused for more coffee. "All the boys are probably scared of you."  
只有他不会质疑她们跟随渚老师学习的动机。“至少我们可以一致认为，应付那些笨女孩真是糟糕透顶。”她停下来又倒了一杯咖啡。“所有男生大概都怕你吧。”

"Aida did ask after you again," he mentioned.  
“相田又问起你了，”他提道。

"And you can tell your roommate _again_ that I will not be a part of his weird fetish movie."  
“你可以再告诉你室友，我不会参与他那奇怪的癖好电影。”

"You should be flattered he wants to cast you as the protagonist in his film class final project. He calls it a kaiju deconstruction. It might be fun working together."  
"你应该感到荣幸，他想让你在他的电影课期末项目中担任主角。他称之为怪兽电影的解构。一起工作可能会很有趣。"

"Just because he suckered you into doing the music is no reason for me to demean myself."  
"仅仅因为他骗你去做音乐，并不意味着我也要贬低自己。"

"All I can do is play," Kaworu said, smiling sadly. "Aida found a new transfer to compose the score. He's an interesting fellow."  
"我只能演奏，" 渚薰悲伤地微笑着说，"相田找到了一个新的转学生来作曲。他是个有趣的家伙。"

"There, see? You won't be lonely. Stop bothering me with this nonsense."  
"看，明白了吧？你不会孤单的。别再用这些胡话烦我了。"

Coffee emptied, they returned to her room to dress before class. Her phone buzzed mid-sock pull and she deigned to look at who was messaging her this early. She regretted it.  
咖啡喝完后，他们回到她的房间准备上课。她正穿袜子时，手机突然震动起来，她不情愿地看了看是谁这么早给她发消息。她后悔了。

"Trouble?" Kaworu asked, buckling his belt.  
"有麻烦吗？" 渚薰一边扣着腰带一边问。

He wasn't the prying kind. She could receive a lewd text from every boy on campus and he'd marvel at how popular she was. His inquiry was nothing but an earnest desire to mitigate her suffering if it was within his power.  
他不是那种爱打探的人。即使她收到校园里每个男孩的露骨短信，他也会惊叹于她的受欢迎程度。他的询问不过是出于真诚的愿望，如果力所能及，希望能减轻她的痛苦。

Asuka rubbed her sleepy eyes with her thumb and forefinger, willing the caffeine to speed through her body faster. "Hikari texted me. She invited us over for dinner. Again."  
明日香用拇指和食指揉了揉困倦的眼睛，希望咖啡因能更快地在她体内起效。“光给我发了短信。她邀请我们去她家吃晚饭。又来了。”

"Sounds nice." “听起来不错。”

"You would think that. I don't need another reminder of how not to live my life." She sighed irritably. "We probably should make an appearance. Let her live vicariously through me for a few hours."  
"你肯定会这么想。我不需要另一个提醒我如何不活自己的生活。" 她不耐烦地叹了口气。"我们大概应该露个面。让她通过我过上几个小时的替身生活。"

"It has been some time since we visited."  
"我们有一段时间没来拜访了。"

"Then it's settled. My future bad mood is on your head."  
"那就这么定了。我未来的坏心情可就赖在你头上了。"

"Noted," Kaworu spoke. "知道了," 渚薰说道。

They ventured back into the dorm hall, by now well populated by other residents in transit to morning classes, and not a few of which made eyes and kissy faces at Kaworu. He bore it with good-natured obliviousness.  
他们再次进入宿舍楼，此时楼内已是人来人往，许多学生正赶往早课，不少人向渚薰投来目光，甚至有人做出亲吻的表情。他对此毫不在意，依旧保持着友好的态度。

They made plans to meet after class at the train station. He leaned down to peck her cheek goodbye. She swatted him away. It was entirely too early for PDA.  
他们约定下课后在车站见面。他俯身轻吻她的脸颊告别。她挥手将他赶开。现在还太早，不适合公开示爱。

"See you later," he said with a serene smile.  
"再见," 他带着平静的微笑说道。

A few girls stumbled in mid-step around them, gazing after him in covetous longing. Asuka wished they'd get the picture: that smile was for her only. She also called dibs on his voice, his slender hands, the effortless swagger of his gait and that ass. And the rest of him. He belonged to her.  
几个女孩在他们周围踉跄了几步，贪婪地望着他的背影。明日香希望她们能明白：那个微笑只属于她。她还宣称对他的声音、他修长的双手、他走路时轻松的姿态以及那臀部都有优先权。还有他的其他一切。他属于她。

"Yeah, later." "嗯，再见。"

They parted ways as the campus' meticulously groomed lawn spread before them, fenced by a string of lecture buildings and other dorms. He left for the music hall, pulling a gaggle of vapid bitches with him, and Asuka was alone. She tried not to think about it.  
他们在校园精心修剪的草坪前分道扬镳，一排教学楼和其他宿舍楼将其围住。他前往音乐厅，身后跟着一群空洞无物的婊子，而明日香独自一人。她尽量不去想这件事。

/\/\/\/\

Soryu Hall loomed over her. Even across the country, as far away as possible from her as academic opportunity allowed, Mama's shadow was impossible to escape. Having the largest, most expensive science wing named after her only reinforced that reality. So Kyoko was brilliant, and rich, and generous, and a pioneering voice in her field, blah blah blah. What had she done lately? Besides raising the picture of perfection that was Asuka. Well, maybe that did deserve a monument.  
索鲁伊大厅在她面前耸立。即使跨越全国，尽可能远离她，学术机会允许的范围内，妈妈的阴影仍无处可逃。拥有最大、最昂贵的科学翼以她的名字命名，只是强化了这一现实。所以响子很聪明，很有钱，很慷慨，是她领域的先驱声音，blah blah blah。她最近做了什么？除了培养出明日香这个完美的形象。嗯，也许这确实值得一个纪念碑。

She entered, and the other science students in the building gave her a wide berth. There was jealousy in the deference, there had always been jealousy, but resentment from afar seemed to be the new norm. Which was fine. She didn't need her shadow crowded by sycophants. Even if it was indeed lonely at the top.  
她走进去，大楼里的其他理科学生都避开了她。这种尊敬中夹杂着嫉妒，一直都有嫉妒，但远距离的怨恨似乎成了新常态。这没关系。她不需要她的影子被谄媚者挤满。即使站在顶端确实孤独。

Asuka entered the lecture hall and claimed her usual seat. The rest maintained their distance, chattering amongst themselves in the kind of blissful lack of awareness only the ignorant have access to.  
明日香走进讲堂，占据了她惯常的座位。其他人保持着距离，沉浸在只有无知者才能享受的那种无忧无虑的闲聊中。

"Good morning, Soryu." “早上好，惣流。”

Asuka glanced up in the general direction of the voice. It was entirely too cheerful for this hour of the day. She grunted recognition of Maya Ibuki, who took it as permission to stay.  
明日香朝着声音的大致方向瞥了一眼。在这个时间段，这声音显得过于欢快了。她咕哝了一声表示认出了伊吹玛雅，后者便当作是允许她留下。

"Did you get my text from earlier?" Maya asked.  
“你收到我之前发的短信了吗？”玛雅问道。

"No." Because Asuka turned her phone off right after hearing from Hikari. Ibuki was terribly inconsiderate to impose upon her like that.  
“没有。”因为明日香在接到光的消息后立刻关掉了手机。伊吹那样做实在是太不顾及他人了。

"Oh. I left my textbook in the room and was hoping you could bring it today. Um, do you mind if I sit next to you and share yours?"  
“哦。我把课本落在房间里了，希望你今天能带过来。嗯，你介意我坐在你旁边和你共用一本吗？”

Further imposition. Ibuki waited, her needy shelter puppy mask firmly in place. Asuka was too tired to put up the necessary fight, and decided to accept the immediate burden rather than deal with any future passive-aggression. They did still technically have to share a room. She motioned for Maya to sit and she hurriedly did.  
进一步的强加。伊吹等待着，她那急需庇护的小狗面具牢牢戴在脸上。明日香太累了，无力进行必要的抗争，决定接受眼前的负担，而不是应对未来的被动攻击。他们仍然在技术上必须共处一室。她示意真由美坐下，真由美急忙照做。

"Thank you. I was helping Professor Akagi again last night and lost track of time. Oh, hey, did you know she has a daughter?"  
“谢谢。我昨晚又在帮赤城教授，忘记了时间。哦，对了，你知道她有个女儿吗？”

Something willingly mated with the Old Hag? "Amazing."  
有什么东西自愿与老巫婆结合？“真神奇。”

"Oh, she is!" Maya said, misunderstanding. "I met her the other day when she stopped by to visit her mother. Ms. Ritsuko is so confident and cool. She's a genius, but she's pursuing computer sciences. It's really incredible how she's stepping out from her mother's shadow like that."  
"哦，她确实是！" 真嗣说，误解了。"前几天我遇见她，她来探望她妈妈。瑞穗女士非常自信又酷。她是天才，却选择了计算机科学。她能这样走出母亲的阴影，真是令人难以置信。"

"Hmm." "嗯。"

"O-Oh, not that Professor Akagi isn't amazing. Why, just last night we were—"  
"哦，不是说赤城教授不厉害。为什么，就在昨晚我们还——"

And Asuka tuned out completely. She knew it was a disservice to herself to compare the Soryu dynasty to whatever mess Akagi called a family. So Naoko's kid was distancing herself from Mother Inferior. So what. Anyone with half a brain could do that. Akagi was a second-rate brand. Asuka could think circles around any of them. Escaping their shadow was child's play. It was escaping Mama's that was taking longer than anticipated.  
而明日香完全没在听。她知道将自己与索鲁家族相比，对赤城那混乱的家庭来说是不公平的。所以直子的小孩正在远离她那劣等的母亲。那又怎样。任何一个有半点脑子的人都能做到。赤城不过是二流品牌。明日香可以轻松地超越他们所有人。逃离他们的阴影不过是小孩子的游戏。真正难的是逃离妈妈的阴影，这比预期的要花更长时间。

"—and the noodles were so soggy we had to send them back," Maya was still talking. "Can you believe it?"  
"—面条都泡软了，我们不得不退回去，" 玛雅还在说。"你能相信吗？"

Professor Akagi entered the hall and all idle chat halted. She strode to the front lectern before a densely scribbled blackboard and cleared her throat for a silence she already had.  
赤城教授走进大厅，所有的闲聊戛然而止。她大步走向前面写满笔记的黑板前的讲台，清了清喉咙，尽管她已经获得了全场的静默。

"Before we begin today," Naoko started by way of introduction, "remember that exams are next week. There won't be a review since you should know all the relevant information. If you do need extra help, you're in the wrong class."  
"在今天开始之前，" 直子以介绍的方式开场，"记住下周有考试。不会有复习，因为你们应该已经掌握了所有相关信息。如果你们确实需要额外帮助，那你们来错班级了。"

Asuka glanced beside her. Maya was studiously taking notes reminding herself she did not need extra help. Asuka sighed. It was Akagi's modus operandi to instill fearful competition in her students to bolster her own image, self and otherwise.  
明日香瞥了一眼身旁。真嗣正认真地做着笔记，提醒自己不需要额外的帮助。明日香叹了口气。赤城总是用激发学生间恐惧竞争的方式来提升自己的形象，这是她的惯用手法。

Maybe such insecurity stemmed from that daughter of hers. Seeing your child surpass you must be a terrifying reminder of mortality, personal limitations and failings. It was yet another good reason not to have kids to begin with. Asuka idly wondered if Mama suffered such—  
也许这种不安全感源自她自己的女儿。看到自己的孩子超越自己，必定是一种对生命有限、个人局限和失败的可怕提醒。这也是另一个不生孩子的好理由。明日香漫不经心地想，妈妈是否也经历过这样的——

That thought failed to finish. No Soryu would fall to weakness like that. Mama would see the perfection she raised and feel an abstract jealousy at most. She gave the world Asuka. No parent could do more than that.  
这个念头没能继续下去。任何一位索伦都不会陷入那样的软弱。妈妈会看到她培养出的完美女儿，最多只会感到一种抽象的嫉妒。她把明日香带到了这个世界。没有父母能做得比这更多了。

/\/\/\/\

She jammed her thumb against the door buzzer. After a moment apartment 221 opened.  
她用力按下门铃。片刻后，221 号公寓的门开了。

"Asuka! Kaworu!" Hikari greeted at the door. "So good to see you two. Please, come in."  
“明日香！薰！”门口的 Hikari 热情地迎接，“见到你们真好。请进吧。”

She stepped aside, ushering them into her home wearing a warm smile and a dirty apron. She epitomized frazzled domestic grace, a state of existence Asuka neither knew nor wanted to know. She slipped her shoes off and steeled herself for what was coming.  
她侧身让开，带着温暖的微笑和脏兮兮的围裙招呼他们进屋。她展现了疲惫却优雅的家庭主妇形象，这种状态是明日香既不了解也不想了解的。她脱下鞋子，做好了迎接即将到来的一切的准备。

"Mr. Kaworu!" A brunette thunderbolt barreled down the small hallway past the living room and latched onto his right leg. "Let's play! Let's play!"  
"川原先生！" 一个棕发小旋风从狭小的走廊冲过客厅，紧紧抱住了他的右腿。"我们来玩吧！来玩吧！"

"Kane," Hikari gently scolded her four-year-old daughter, "they just got here. Let them relax a bit and—"  
"凯恩，" 光子温柔地责备她四岁的女儿，"他们刚到。让他们休息一下，然后——"

"It's alright," Kaworu told her, already being pulled away into a fantasy kingdom. "Why don't you two talk. It's been a while."  
"没关系，" 川原告诉她，已经被拉进了一个幻想王国。"你们俩聊聊吧。已经有一段时间了。"

They departed and Asuka followed Hikari into the partitioned kitchen. From the stove they had a clear view of the living room where Kane was gleefully informing Kaworu what they would be playing today. Hikari returned to prepping dinner.  
他们离开了，明日香跟着光走进了隔开的厨房。从炉子那里，他们可以清楚地看到客厅，凯恩正兴高采烈地告诉渚他们今天将玩什么游戏。光回到准备晚餐的工作中。

"How are classes?" she asked Asuka.  
“课业如何？”她问明日香。

"Infested by idiots who don't know anything or have any direction in life. So, the same as ever. How's… your stuff going?"  
“被一群什么都不懂、生活毫无方向的傻瓜占据。所以，一如既往。你……的事情进展如何？”

"Well, Kane started swimming lessons last week. She's really taken to the water, and even jumped in the deep end by herself. We're looking at preschools with Kodama's help… Oh, she just broke up with her boyfriend again, by the way. They can't keep doing this. Nozomi is graduating high school this year; I was hoping I could put her in contact with you about university opportunities…" She yawned. "Excuse me. Sleep is still a luxury. I'm sure Toji has sleep apnea or something but he refuses to go in for a study to diagnose it. The snoring is getting out of hand…"  
"嗯，凯恩上周开始上游泳课了。她真的很喜欢水，甚至自己跳进了深水区。我们正在小玉的帮助下寻找幼儿园……哦，顺便说一句，她又和男朋友分手了。他们不能再这样下去了。长美今年高中毕业；我希望能把她介绍给你，了解一下大学的机会……"她打了个哈欠。"不好意思。睡眠仍然是一种奢侈。我敢肯定，托吉有睡眠呼吸暂停症之类的，但他拒绝去做诊断研究。打鼾声已经失控了……"

Asuka forced a compliant expression. There. Communications reestablished in record time. Could she leave yet?  
明日香强装出顺从的表情。好了，通讯在创纪录的时间内重新建立。她现在可以离开了吗？

A shrill squeal of delight echoed from the living room as Kane directed Kaworu to die a dramatic death, and he did, sprawled over the carpet. Kane then told him to rise and they were off on another vignette adventure, weaving different fairy tales together, constrained only by her whims and imagination.  
客厅里传来凯恩兴奋的尖叫声，她指挥着渚上演一出戏剧性的死亡，他便四肢摊开倒在地毯上。随后，凯恩让他站起来，他们又开始了另一段小插曲冒险，将不同的童话故事编织在一起，仅受限于她的奇思妙想和想象力。

Sometimes she declared he was Peter Pan, flying her to adventure in Neverland. Or he was Prince Charming, gallantly saving the day. Or any number of heroes to play off her princess persona. She flitted between them, too excited to stay on one for long, trying to maximize the meager time she had with Kaworu before reality intruded. No matter what they played he followed her lead.  
有时她宣称他是彼得潘，带她飞向永无乡的冒险。或是他是白马王子，英勇地拯救一切。又或是任何一位英雄，与她的公主形象相得益彰。她在他们之间穿梭，兴奋得难以长久停留于一人，试图在现实介入前最大限度地利用与渚薰相处的短暂时光。无论他们扮演什么角色，他都跟随她的引导。

"Kane just adores Kaworu," Hikari led. "He's so good with children."  
“阿薰特别喜欢和渚薰在一起，”光子引导道，“他对孩子们特别好。”

Asuka decided to nip this familiar conversation in the bud. "You're mistaking inhuman patience for actual kid skills. All he does is let her dictate what they do. It's no different than if she was manipulating a doll."  
明日香决定就此打住这个熟悉的对话。“你把非人的耐心误认为是真正的育儿技巧了。他所做的不过是让她决定做什么。这和她操纵一个玩偶没什么两样。”

"Oh, I don't know. He has to be quick-witted to adapt and he doesn't mind looking silly for her amusement. And yes, patience is a virtue, but he wants to make her happy. He'd make a wonderful father."  
"哦，我不知道。他必须机智灵活以适应变化，并且不介意为了她的快乐而显得傻气。没错，耐心是一种美德，但他希望让她快乐。他会成为一个出色的父亲。"

Wow. She was laying it on thicker than usual. Her oldest friend wanting Asuka to abandon her academic promise and future career to pop out a few silver-haired babies seemed rather selfish to her, but maybe Hikari was simply looking for someone to commiserate with.  
哇。她说得比平时更夸张了。她最老的朋友希望明日香放弃她的学术前途和未来事业，去生几个银发宝宝，这在她看来相当自私，但也许光只是想找个人一起抱怨。

"I'm not saying _immediately_," Hikari went on with a smile, only half-joking. "But someday when—"  
"我不是说马上，"光笑着继续说，半开玩笑地说。"但有一天当——"

"Please stop." "请停下来。"

The front door to the apartment rattled open and Toji slogged inside. "Yo," he greeted, before realizing there were extra shoes by the doormat. "Hey, you guys made it—"  
公寓的前门嘎吱一声打开，Toji 拖着沉重的步伐走了进来。“哟，”他打了个招呼，随即注意到门垫旁多了几双鞋。“嘿，你们来了——”

"Daddy!" Kane rushed to him for a quick hug. Then immediately returned to Kaworu's side to play.  
"爸爸！" Kane 冲过去给了他一个快速的拥抱，然后立刻回到 Kaworu 身边继续玩耍。

Toji deflated. "I should know better by now. Can't compete."  
冬二泄了气。“我早该明白的。比不过啊。”

"Welcome home," Hikari greeted, and they shared a quick peck. "Dinner's on the stove. It'll be ready in fifteen minutes."  
“欢迎回家。”光欢迎道，两人迅速亲了一下。“晚饭在炉子上，十五分钟后就好了。”

"Smells good." He trailed her into the kitchen, loosening his tie. "Can I help out?"  
“闻起来不错。”他跟着她走进厨房，松了松领带。“我能帮忙吗？”

"Nope. Everything's taken care of. Just relax." She returned to the stove.  
"不用，一切都安排妥当了。放松就好。" 她回到炉子旁。

Toji chuckled. "Amazing what can be accomplished when Nagisa's here to distract Kane." He shared a look with the other adult in the kitchen. "Soryu."  
冬二轻笑。"有渚薰在这里分散加持的注意力，真是事半功倍。" 他与厨房里的另一位成年人交换了一个眼神。"索留。"

"Suzuhara." "铃原。"

"Glad you could finally stop by for dinner. We were beginning to think our invites weren't reaching you."  
"很高兴你终于能来吃晚饭了。我们开始以为邀请函都没送到你那儿呢。"

And the battle resumed. 战斗再次打响。

"I've been busy furthering my education and pursuing a fulfilling career," she told him. "You know how it is. Oh, wait. You wouldn't."  
"我一直在忙于深造和追求一份充实的事业，"她告诉他。"你知道的。哦，等等。你不会懂的。"

"Yeah, I'm too involved in the real world to worry about homework."  
"是啊，我太沉浸在现实世界里，没空担心作业。"

"When did you ever worry about homework?"  
"你什么时候担心过作业？"

He took a breath to retaliate, thought a moment, and shrugged. "I'm going to play with my daughter," he said, like she should envy him.  
他深吸一口气准备反驳，想了想，耸耸肩。“我要去陪女儿玩了，”他说，好像她应该羡慕他似的。

"Knock yourself out, please."  
"请随意，别客气。"

Toji left the kitchen and stepped foot inside the magic kingdom of his living room. Kane didn't notice, deep into a scene of brave princesses and valiant princes. Toji gestured for attention. He cleared his throat. Kane played.  
东治离开了厨房，踏入了他客厅的魔法王国。凯恩沉浸在勇敢的公主和英勇王子的场景中，没有注意到。东治示意他注意，清了清嗓子。凯恩继续玩着。

"Hey," her father finally spoke. "Who can I be?"  
"嘿，"她的父亲终于开口了，"我能扮演谁呢？"

Kane spun on him. _"Dad,"_ she whined, "you're in our story." She shooed him away.  
凯恩转身面对他。“爸爸，”她抱怨道，“你闯进我们的故事了。”她挥手让他离开。

"Come on! I missed you all day. I want to play with you, too."  
“来吧！我一整天都在想你们。我也想和你们一起玩。”

"But, Dad…" “但是，爸爸……”

She turned to Kaworu. He smiled at her, showing no offense would be taken at the intrusion, but at the same time not offering to resolve the situation himself. Toji wasn't going anywhere, and finally Kane huffed in resignation.  
她转向薰。他向她微笑，表明不会因被打扰而感到冒犯，但同时也没有主动提出解决这个局面。剑介丝毫没有离开的意思，最终，绫子无奈地叹了口气。

_"Fine,"_ she said. "Dad, you be the monster."  
“好吧，”她说，“爸爸，你来当怪兽。”

"But I'm always the monster!" he complained. "Can't I be a good guy this time?"  
“可我总是当怪兽！”他抱怨道，“这次我不能当个好人吗？”

"No. Mr. Kaworu is the good guy. You're the monster."  
“不，渚先生是好人。你才是怪物。”

Toji frowned. "Fine." He grinned and adopted a beastly voice. "But you'll never escape my clutches!"  
真嗣皱眉。“好吧。”他咧嘴一笑，模仿着野兽的声音。“但你永远逃不出我的魔掌！”

He grappled his daughter and she wailed in mock terror. "Save me, Mr. Kaworu!"  
他抓住女儿，她假装惊恐地大叫。“救救我，渚先生！”

Kaworu weakly used his index finger as a sword to combat his friend.  
渚薰虚弱地用他的食指当作剑，与朋友对抗。

"Wha ha ha!" Toji laughed diabolically. "Your puny sword is no match for me! The princess is mine!"  
“哇哈哈哈！”冬二邪恶地大笑，“你那微不足道的剑根本不是我的对手！公主是我的了！”

_"Dad,"_ Kane moaned, shoving him away. "You're not playing right. You're supposed to die now. Or at least lose a leg or something." He protested and she gave him her most sour face. "Mr. Kaworu is the good guy and the good guy always wins."  
“爸，”凯恩抱怨着推开他，“你玩得不对。你现在应该死了。或者至少失去一条腿什么的。”他抗议道，并给了他一个最酸的脸色。“渚薰先生是好人，而好人总是会赢的。”

"Dinner time!" Hikari called out, preventing her husband from arguing further. "Wash hands!"  
“吃饭啦！”光大声喊道，阻止了丈夫继续争论。“洗手去！”

Kane pouted, but dragged herself to the sink. "Can I sit next to Mr. Kaworu?"  
凯恩噘着嘴，但还是拖着脚步走向水槽。“我可以坐在卡沃鲁先生旁边吗？”

They ate. Kaworu made complimentary dialogue with Hikari about her meal of store-bought spaghetti. He possessed a refined palette but no practical ability in the kitchen. Just as well as far as Asuka was concerned. Food prep was best left to high school dropouts and housewives.  
他们开始用餐。卡沃鲁对光买的现成意大利面赞不绝口，尽管他品味高雅，却毫无厨艺可言。对明日香来说，这倒也无妨，毕竟准备食物这种事还是留给高中辍学生和家庭主妇吧。

Kaworu volunteered for dish duty over Kane's heartbroken objections. Hikari tempted her with a rare opportunity to spend time on her daddy's tablet with a few kid-friendly apps. She was immediately refocused.  
在碇的伤心反对声中，渚自告奋勇去洗碗。光用一个难得的机会诱惑她——可以在爸爸的平板上玩几个适合孩子的应用。她立刻重新集中了注意力。

Hikari packed away leftovers and prepared lunches for tomorrow. Kaworu washed dishes and Toji dried, the pair in conversation about some obscure Japanese band they both liked. Hating to appear unnecessary but also hating menial chores, Asuka deigned to sit on the couch by Kane. The girl was too absorbed in a tablet memory game to offer a greeting.  
光收拾好剩菜，为明天准备午餐。渚洗碗，冬二擦干，两人聊着他们都喜欢的一个冷门的日本乐队。虽然不想显得多余，也不喜欢琐碎的家务，但明日香还是决定坐在碇旁边的沙发上。女孩正沉浸在平板上的记忆游戏中，没有打招呼。

It took all of Asuka's patience to wait a full half-minute before dictating the right answer to the game. The little girl looked at her.  
明日香花了整整半分钟耐心等待，然后才告诉她游戏的正确答案。小女孩看着她。

"I was playing that," Kane pointed out.  
"我正在玩那个，" 凯恩指出。

"I was helping you." "我是在帮你。"

"You could have given me a hint."  
"你本可以给我个提示的。"

"There's no guarantee that would work." The kid wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer. She was certainly no Asuka age four. "What's that look for?"  
“那并不能保证有效。”这孩子可不是最机灵的那类。她当然比不上四岁时的明日香。“你那是什么表情？”

Kane studied her. "Mommy told me to be nice to you."  
凯恩打量着她。“妈妈让我对你好点。”

Asuka felt deeper offense than she wanted. People shouldn't have to be told to like her. They should simply like her. "Oh? You always do what your mommy tells you?"  
明日香感到比她愿意承认的更受冒犯。人们不应该被要求才喜欢她，他们应该自然而然地喜欢她。“哦？你总是听妈妈的话吗？”

"No." She shrugged. "But Mr. Kaworu's nice to you, so I have to be nice to you, too." She spoke matter-of-factly. She returned to the tablet, selecting a new game.  
“不。”她耸耸肩。“但碇先生对你很好，所以我也要对你好。”她语气平淡。她回到平板电脑前，选择了一个新游戏。

_Little bitch,_ Asuka thought.  
小婊子，明日香心想。

Lunches made and dishes cleaned, the adults reassembled around the couch in the living room. Light talk circulated, relating any other news since their last meeting. Toji complained about work, Asuka complained about classes, then they complained about each other. Hikari and Kaworu played diplomat.  
午餐做好，餐具清洗干净后，大人们重新聚集在客厅的沙发周围。轻松的谈话流转，分享自上次见面以来的其他新闻。剑介抱怨工作，明日香抱怨课程，然后他们互相抱怨。光和渚薰则充当和事佬。

Kaworu talking again refocused Kane, who abandoned the tablet and dragged him away to play.  
渚薰再次开口让凯恩回过神来，他丢下平板，拽着渚薰去玩耍了。

"You know," Toji began, looking on, "I almost forgot how great Nagisa is with kids—"  
“你知道吗，”真嗣开始说道，旁观着，“我差点忘了渚薰和孩子相处得有多好——”

"Shut up," Asuka said. “闭嘴，”明日香说。

/\/\/\/\

It was after eight when Toji and Hikari finally cajoled Kane to part with Kaworu, and he and Asuka were on the train back to university. It was sparsely crowded by a few late shift workers on board, the flood of drunken collegiate partiers still hours away.  
当真嗣和光终于哄骗剑离开渚薰时，已经是晚上八点多了，他和明日香正乘火车返回大学。车厢里零星坐着几位晚班工人，而那些醉醺醺的大学生派对狂欢者还要几个小时才会涌入。

Asuka tried to relish the peace. She forgot how exhausting it was to have friends. Especially friends married to imbeciles and raising their inferior spawn. How Hikari's juvenile crush on Skeeze-uhara progressed so far was still baffling. Did she stop maturing at age fourteen? Didn't she know she could do, well, not as well as Asuka, but better than Toji plus kid? Which was like having two kids?  
明日香试图享受这份宁静。她忘记了有朋友是多么累人的事。尤其是那些嫁给傻瓜并养育他们劣等后代的朋友。光对那个叫什么来着的家伙的幼稚迷恋是如何发展到这一步的，至今仍让她困惑。难道她十四岁后就停止成长了吗？她不知道自己可以做得，嗯，虽然没有明日香那么好，但比真嗣加孩子要好吗？这简直就像带着两个孩子一样？

"That was certainly three hours of my life," she groaned.  
“那真是浪费了我三个小时的生命。”她抱怨道。

"Wasn't it nice to see them again?"  
"再次见到他们不是很愉快吗？"

"We can keep in contact through text. Face-to-face meetings are obsolete. Seeing that familial mess in person only reinforces my original apprehensions about going."  
"我们可以通过短信保持联系。面对面见面已经过时了。亲眼看到那个家庭的混乱只会加强我最初对去的担忧。"

It was depressing to see her oldest friend so fallen, and then pretend she wasn't one foot in the gutter. Hikari's open secret desperation was palpable as the joyful family acting routine slowly crushed her soul. She was shockingly devoted to the lie.  
看到她最老的朋友如此堕落，然后假装她没有一脚踩在沟里，这令人沮丧。光明的公开秘密般的绝望感随着欢乐的家庭表演逐渐压垮她的灵魂而变得明显。她对谎言的忠诚令人震惊。

"Why does any sane person want kids?"  
“为什么任何一个理智的人会想要孩子？”

"Oh," Kaworu said, smiling gently, "there are reasons."  
“哦，”渚薰微笑着温柔地说，“是有原因的。”

Asuka peered at his profile as the night sped by outside the train window. "Stupid reasons. And we both know Hikari's kid was a 'happy accident.' One that necessitated their shotgun wedding right out of high school."  
明日香透过火车窗看着外面飞驰而过的夜景，审视着他的侧脸。“愚蠢的理由。我们都知道光的孩子是个‘意外之喜’。这个意外直接导致了他们在高中毕业后就匆匆举行了婚礼。”

"Granted, but Hikari always wanted children. It was simply a matter of time."  
“当然，但光总是想要孩子的。只是时间问题。”

"Tell that to Suzuhara. Sometimes I think it was all according to her grand design. And that includes the wage-slave job she got her dad to give him."  
“跟铃原说去吧。有时候我觉得这一切都是她精心策划的。包括她让老爸给他安排的那份打工奴隶的工作。”

He shrugged good-naturedly. "They all seem happy."  
他友好地耸了耸肩。“他们看起来都很幸福。”

"Seem is the operative word."  
‘看似’是关键字。

Hikari was a sleep-deprived mess raising a hyperactive child and married to another. Toji hated his job, and the rest of Hikari's family hated him. Kane was a brat who only seemed content around Kaworu. The three of them were trapped in that tiny apartment with no feasible means of escape.  
光是一个睡眠不足的混乱状态，既要抚养一个过度活跃的孩子，又要应付另一个婚姻。真嗣讨厌他的工作，而光的家人也都讨厌他。薰则是个小鬼，只有在渚薰身边才显得满足。这三个人被困在那间狭小的公寓里，没有任何可行的逃脱方式。

Hikari's academic career ended after she pregnantly squeaked through high school. Toji was stuck under her father's thumb. And Kane wouldn't be winning any scholarships. She'd probably wind up doomed to her mother's fate, knocked up by her first juvenile crush and never knowing better.  
光的高中学业在她怀孕的尖叫声中草草结束。真嗣一直受制于她父亲的掌控之下。而薰也不会赢得任何奖学金。她很可能会重蹈她母亲的覆辙，被第一个青春期的迷恋对象搞大肚子，永远不知道更好的选择。

"Regardless," Kaworu said, "it was nice to help them out for a little."  
"无论如何，" 渚薰说道，"能帮他们一点忙真是太好了。"

"They need all the help they can get."  
"他们需要尽可能多的帮助。"

There was no way settling for a life of hidden resentment and squandered opportunities could be worth living. How could anyone be happy wearing their tired, fake smiles?  
选择一种充满隐忍怨恨和错失良机的生活，怎么可能值得过下去呢？人们怎能带着疲惫的假笑而感到幸福呢？

/\/\/\/\

Exams began tomorrow for science students. Asuka knew the material but the exacting particulars of Akagi combined with Japanese texts necessitated a middleman named Kaworu. That, and she studied better when he was giving her a foot rub. Not that she needed to study.  
理科生的考试明天就要开始了。明日香对这些内容了如指掌，但赤木律子那严谨的细节要求加上日文教材，让她不得不找了个中间人——渚薰。而且，有他在给她做足底按摩时，她的学习效率更高。并不是说她真的需要学习。

_So I just want a foot rub,_ she admitted to herself. _Sue me._  
所以，我只是想要个足底按摩，她对自己坦白。告我啊。

So what if she was monopolizing his magic fingers. He didn't have to practice piano; his skill was innate. But best not to chance him getting rusty on the massage front.  
就算她独占了他的神奇手指又怎样。他不需要练习钢琴；他的技艺是天生的。但最好还是别让他在这按摩方面生疏了。

Asuka crossed the sloped lawn before the music hall. It was lunch hour and several students were arting it up outside. Including Kaworu, stretched out on the manicured grass basking in the sun, talking to an unidentified sliver of humanity.  
明日香穿过音乐厅前的斜坡草坪。正值午餐时间，不少学生在外面尽情享受艺术氛围。其中包括薰，他躺在修剪整齐的草地上，沐浴着阳光，与一个不知名的人类交谈。

She almost hesitated. It was unusual for Kaworu to take a lunch break away from an instrument unless she was present. When he wasn't focused on her, he was focused on music. And even then, he was thinking about Asuka. Who wouldn't?  
她几乎犹豫了一下。薰通常不会在午餐时间离开乐器，除非她在场。当他不专注于她时，他便专注于音乐。即便如此，他仍在想着明日香。谁会不想呢？

Seeing him act contrary to established behavior colored him a shade unfaithful. Rationally she dismissed it, yet still approached with a point to prove.  
看到他行为反常，让她觉得他有些不忠。理智上她否定了这种想法，但仍带着证明什么的意图走近。

"Asuka," he waved her over as she neared, pretending for all the world like nothing was amiss.  
"明日香," 当她走近时，他挥手示意她过来，装作一切都正常的样子。

She stopped a yard away from any embrace and crossed her arms. "Was there a bomb scare or something?"  
她在离拥抱还有一码的地方停下，交叉双臂。"是有炸弹威胁还是怎么的？"

He smiled in pleasant confusion as he stood. "Just eating outdoors today."  
他站起身，带着愉快的困惑微笑。"今天只是在外面吃饭而已。"

She nodded to the generic boy beside him. "With company?"  
她向坐在他旁边的普通男孩点了点头。“有伴吗？”

Kaworu's smile turned strangely proud, she thought. He looked at the boy.  
渚薰的微笑变得有些奇怪的自豪，她想。他看着那个男孩。

"Asuka," he spoke, "this is Shinji Ikari."  
“明日香，”他介绍道，“这是碇真嗣。”

His tone implied reverent interest. That tone should be reserved for her, and maybe that bistro downtown that made those really good sandwiches.  
他的语气透露出敬畏的兴趣。这种语气应该只属于她，还有那家市中心的小酒馆，他们做的三明治真的很好吃。

"Who?" “谁？”

"The composer for Aida's film," Kaworu explained. "I could have sworn I mentioned him before…"  
“《阿依达》电影的作曲家，”渚薰解释道，“我敢肯定我之前提到过他……”

Asuka shrugged. Anything involving Aida was best forgotten as quickly as possible.  
明日香耸了耸肩。任何牵扯到相田的事情最好尽快忘掉。

"Um, hello," Shinji greeted, then finally stood. He took a breath to say more.  
“呃，你好，”真嗣打了个招呼，然后终于站了起来。他深吸一口气，准备再说些什么。

"Good for you." She turned to her boyfriend. "We need to go. You have that thing you need to do right now."  
“你真行。”她转向她的男朋友，“我们得走了。你还有那件事现在就得去做。”

"Oh. Okay." "哦。好吧。"

After Kaworu's unnecessary farewell to anonymous personified, Asuka was leading him back to her dorm room. Her feet wouldn't massage themselves. He ruined the anticipation by talking.  
在渚薰对某个无名拟人化对象进行了不必要的告别后，明日香正领着他回到她的宿舍房间。她的脚可不会自己按摩。他一开口说话，就把那份期待给毁了。

"What did you think?" he asked.  
"你觉得怎么样？" 他问道。"

"About what?" "关于什么？"

"Shinji Ikari." "碇真嗣。"

"What's there to think about?"  
"有什么好想的？"

Kaworu almost frowned. "I suppose it isn't fair to form an opinion until you hear him play…"  
渚薰几乎要皱眉了。“我想，在听他演奏之前就下结论确实不公平……”

Which would happen over her dead body. "You're that impressed?"  
那得等她死了以后。“你就这么印象深刻？”

"His ability to create music is truly enviable."  
“他创作音乐的能力确实令人羡慕。”

She scoffed. "Any clown can put two notes together and call it music. It takes someone special to do it right."  
她嗤之以鼻。“任何小丑都能把两个音符凑在一起，称之为音乐。但只有特别的人才能做到恰到好处。”

"Indeed." “确实。”

They reached her dorm and she forbade any further conversation not related to feet. He expertly worked bipedal magic as she drifted over her biology texts. Kaworu was in high spirits the rest of his break. The foot rub was better than anticipated.  
他们到了她的宿舍，她禁止任何与脚无关的对话。他熟练地施展着双足的魔法，而她则沉浸在生物学课本中。接下来的假期里，渚薰心情格外愉悦。足部按摩的效果比预期还要好。

/\/\/\/\

She pushed open the doors of Soryu Hall on her way to Akagi's advanced biology class. A collection of girls were outside the classroom, gathered around a bulletin board. Exams were finally over, and results were posted for the science student body to again realize who their superior was. Asuka slowed her gait as their conversation reached her ears and she slid behind a bend in the hall.  
她推开 Soryu 会堂的大门，前往赤城的高级生物课。一群女生聚集在教室外的布告栏前。考试终于结束了，理科学生们的成绩被公布出来，再次让他们意识到谁是佼佼者。明日香放慢了脚步，当她们的对话传入耳中时，她悄悄地绕到了大厅的拐角处。

"Well," a thin girl said, "Soryu scored top. Again."  
“嗯，”一个瘦弱的女孩说，“Soryu 又是第一名。”

"Shocking." “真是令人震惊。”

"Yeah. I guess that chip on her shoulder is going to get heavier now."  
"是啊。我想她肩上的担子现在会更重了。"

"You're roommates with her, right, Ibuki?" another girl asked Maya, who was among the crowd. "What's it like?"  
"你是和她同寝室的，对吧，伊吹？" 另一个女孩问麻耶，她也在人群中。"那是什么感觉？"

"Um…" She fidgeted. "You know, we don't really see each other that often. I mean, I'm busy with professor Akagi and Soryu is busy with, um, other things."  
"嗯……" 她有些局促。"你知道的，我们其实不怎么见面。我是说，我忙着跟赤城教授，而丽则忙着，呃，其他事情。"

"Other things?" “其他方面呢？”

A heavy girl piped up. "Being a star test-taker doesn't come cheap."  
一个胖乎乎的女孩插话道：“成为明星考生可不是免费的。”

"Yeah. I'm sure she's either cheating somehow, or cramming twenty-four/seven."  
“是啊。我敢肯定她要么在作弊，要么就是二十四小时不停地学习。”

Asuka smirked. Such jealousy in her peers.  
明日香微微一笑。同学们的嫉妒之情溢于言表。

Another student shrugged. "But like, what else does she have going for her? Good grades and a free ride because of her mom only go so far."  
另一个学生耸耸肩。“但除了这些，她还有什么呢？好成绩和因为妈妈而得的奖学金也只能帮她到这儿了。”

"Or she'll just coast by on her looks."  
“或者她会靠自己的美貌轻松过关。”

"You call that pretty?" "你管那叫漂亮？"

"It seems it was enough to capture a hotty."  
"看来足够吸引一个帅哥了。"

"For now. A hold like hers is tenuous. And keeping such a tight leash on her boyfriend must be exhausting."  
"目前是。她的魅力并不稳固。而且对男朋友控制得这么紧，肯定很累人。"

The girls giggled. 女孩们咯咯笑了起来。

"God," the thin girl sighed, "Nagisa is so freaking hot."  
"天哪，"瘦女孩叹息道，"渚真是太性感了。"

"I know, right? Like, crazy hot."  
"就是啊，简直热得离谱。"

"And not just hot, but he's cool and talented, too."  
"不仅帅气，他还很酷，而且才华横溢。"

"And smart." "而且聪明。"

"And nice." "而且善良。"

"And hot." "而且很热。"

"You said that already." "你已经说过了。"

"It bears repeating." "这值得重复。"

They giggled again. 他们又咯咯笑了起来。

"How did Soryu land a guy like him?"  
“索鲁怎么钓到他那样的男人的？”

Asuka stared in bemusement. What on earth did that mean? She expected envy from these petty low-level skanks but that was staggeringly delusional.  
明日香困惑地盯着她们。这到底是什么意思？她本以为这些低级小婊子会嫉妒，但这未免也太自以为是了。

"I know, right? It's not as if Nagisa's hurting for potential girlfriends. What gives?"  
"我知道，对吧？濑名并不是找不到女朋友的那种人。这是怎么回事？"

"Everybody knows Soryu's so below him… did she blackmail him maybe?"  
"大家都知道宗像比她强多了……她是不是威胁他了？"

"Or he feels sorry for her? She tries so hard to be as good as him."  
"还是他同情她？她那么努力想要和他一样优秀。"

"Ibuki, do you have any ideas?"  
"伊吹，你有什么想法吗？"

"They met young," Maya said. "I think they were dating since grade school." She shrugged. "I suppose Nagisa never knew better."  
"他们从小就认识，" 真矢说。"我想他们从小学就开始交往了。" 她耸耸肩。"我想渚从未有过更好的选择。"

Asuka stumbled. _Even Ibuki?_  
明日香踉跄了一下。连伊吹也是？

She was cold. A wave of dizzy nausea swept over her and she was forced to grab the wall for support. People… people thought Kaworu was settling for her?  
她感到寒冷。一阵晕眩和恶心袭来，她不得不抓住墙壁以保持平衡。人们……人们以为渚薰是屈就于她？

Utter nonsense. She was a perfect star unto the sun and everyone knew it, Kaworu first and foremost. _She_ chose _him_. She was the instigator at every step. There was no mistaking that, no matter how admired he was and how jealous everyone was of her. To think otherwise was to fundamentally misunderstand who wore the pants in the relationship, even if Kaworu was brilliant and talented and kind and popular and hot and—  
简直是胡说八道。她是一颗完美的太阳，这一点人尽皆知，渚薰更是首当其冲。是她选择了他。每一步都是她主动的。这一点毋庸置疑，无论他多么受人敬仰，无论别人对她有多么嫉妒。否则就是根本误解了这段关系中谁是主导，即使渚薰才华横溢、善良、受欢迎、帅气而且——

Asuka fought back some bile. _Oh, God._  
明日香强忍住呕吐感。哦，天哪。

Did his brilliance outshine her own?  
他的光芒是否盖过了她？

Back in grade school they were the top two, the ultimate teenage power couple. Somewhere in the transition to university the comfortable small pond she was accustomed to exploded outward into a vast sea and she no longer was the obvious big fish. The suck-ups orbiting her drifted away; the world demanded more from her. It was messy and lonely.  
在小学时，他们曾是顶尖的两人，终极的青少年权力情侣。在升入大学的过程中，她习惯的舒适小池塘突然向外扩张成广阔的海洋，她不再是那条显而易见的大鱼。围绕着她的马屁精们逐渐离去；世界对她提出了更多要求。这既混乱又孤独。

But Kaworu never faltered. He adeptly swam with the current, meeting new people and expanding his horizons while wearing a tranquil smile. Like he enjoyed the challenge.  
但渚薰从未动摇。他熟练地随波逐流，结识新朋友并拓展视野，脸上始终带着平静的微笑。仿佛他享受着挑战。

Like it wasn't a challenge at all.  
仿佛这根本不是什么挑战。

_No,_ she thought. _No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no._  
不，她想。不不不不。

Even if their world had changed, they had not. They remained Asuka and her guy. Not Kaworu the gorgeous piano genius who walked on water _and that chick_. No matter what the others said. No matter what anyone said. She knew it, and he knew it. She knew it.  
即使他们的世界已经改变，他们依然如故。他们仍然是明日香和她的男孩。不是那个在水上行走、美得惊人的钢琴天才渚薰和那个女孩。无论别人怎么说。无论任何人怎么说。她知道这一点，他也知道。她坚信这一点。

/\/\/\/\

She wasn't looking for ego reinforcement, she told herself. She was only wheeling out of the science hall and skipping class to fulfill a sudden irresistible urge to see her boyfriend. He deserved a treat. Not like she'd learn anything new in class from Akagi, anyway. This had nothing to do with a solipsistic need to reaffirm her own dominance.  
她告诉自己，她并非在寻求自我肯定。只是刚从科学馆推着轮椅出来，突然无法抗拒地想要见她的男朋友。他值得一个惊喜。反正从赤城那里也学不到什么新东西，上课也没什么意思。这跟她需要通过某种自我中心的方式来确认自己的主导地位无关。

Asuka entered the music wing, an architect student's pretentious wet dream. It was a convoluted tangle of private practice rooms, lecture halls and two theaters for full orchestras. She rarely visited, content with letting Kaworu be musically brilliant on his own. She played the violin but it was never a passion or even a hobby; Mama declared she would learn an instrument and she did, through sweat and tears. It wasn't like Kaworu's effortless talent.  
明日香走进音乐区，那里简直是建筑系学生的矫情梦境。它是一个错综复杂的私人练习室、讲堂和两个供大型管弦乐队使用的剧院的集合体。她很少来这里，乐意让加持独自在音乐上闪耀。她会拉小提琴，但这从未成为她的热情或爱好；妈妈宣称她应该学一种乐器，于是她通过汗水和泪水学会了。这与加持那种毫不费力的天赋截然不同。

She found the practice room he frequented. Natural light poured in from high windows. At the head of the room Shinji Ikari composed for an audience of empty chairs.  
她找到了他常去的练习室。自然光从高高的窗户倾泻而入。在房间的一端，碇真嗣对着一排空椅子作曲。

Asuka stayed at the door and listened. This was what Kaworu spoke so highly of? This sad assault of a cello? He was rarely impressed with anything outside the subject of Asuka Langley Soryu, so she held the inkling of a minor interest in this boy. And this was what greeted her. Even if her idea of high musical art was progressive German nu death metal, she could tell when someone was committing a crime with a classical instrument.  
明日香站在门口倾听。这就是渚薰如此推崇的吗？这悲伤的大提琴攻击？他很少对明日香·兰格雷以外的任何事物印象深刻，所以她对这个男孩产生了一丝微小的兴趣。而这就是她所迎接的。即使她对高雅音乐的认知是德国前卫新死亡金属，她也能分辨出谁在使用古典乐器犯罪。

Shinji continued on for a moment, stopped abruptly and scribbled a few notations on his messy sheet music. He stretched and set to restart when he realized he wasn't alone anymore.  
真嗣继续演奏了一会儿，突然停下，在凌乱的乐谱上潦草地记下几笔。他伸展了一下身体，准备重新开始，这时才意识到自己不再是独自一人。

"Oh," he said, turning around in his seat. The relaxed frenzy he attacked his cello with dissolved under a bright anxious discomfort. "Uh, hello? Ms. Soryu, right?"  
“哦，”他说着，在座位上转过身来。他之前对大提琴的狂热攻击在明亮而焦虑的不适中消散了。“呃，你好？是碇同学，对吧？”

"Akari, wasn't it?" "是明理，对吧？"

"Ikari." "伊卡里。"

_Whatever._ "Whatever. Where's Kaworu? He should be here."  
管他呢。"管他呢。卡罗在哪里？他应该在这儿的。"

"He and Aida stepped out to secure some new instruments for the film. They should be back soon. Sorry."  
"他和 Aida 出去为电影采购一些新设备了。他们应该很快就回来。抱歉。"

Asuka snorted. She tapped her foot. She sighed and entered the room, depositing herself at an empty chair to wait. Shinji returned to his music, marking more notes, but refrained from playing. She studied him, and he bore it with a tense self-consciousness.  
明日香哼了一声。她跺了跺脚。叹了口气，走进房间，坐在一张空椅子上等待。真嗣回到他的乐谱前，继续做标记，但没有演奏。她打量着他，而他则带着紧张的自我意识承受着她的目光。

So this skinny pile of nerves was Kaworu's new besty. What on earth did he see in him? It spoke to his calmly pathological need to make those less fortunate happy. Or his latent bisexuality Asuka had to hammer down regularly.  
这个瘦弱的神经质家伙就是渚薰的新好友。他到底看上他哪一点了？这反映了他那种平静的病态需求，想要让那些不如自己幸运的人快乐。或者是他那潜藏的双性恋倾向，明日香不得不时常压制。

She needed a distraction from the encroaching cloud of negativity and spoke: "So. You're like the composer, huh?" He affirmed that he was like the composer. "You're really on scholarship here for it?"  
她需要从那逐渐逼近的负面情绪中抽离，于是开口道：“这么说，你是作曲家咯？”他确认了自己的身份。“你真的是靠奖学金来这里的吗？”

"Actually, no. Music is more of a hobby for me. My parents discouraged it, but Kaworu has been really supportive."  
“其实不是。音乐对我来说更多是爱好。我父母并不支持，但渚薰一直很支持我。”

She eyed him. "You call him by his first name?"  
她打量着他。“你直接叫他的名字？”

Far be it for her to question the insane personal decorum of the Japanese but this rookie in the Kaworu-bowl was aiming for the fences if he was already on a first name basis. It took even Aida a couple months for that play, mostly due to Asuka's constant refrain of not befriending that weirdo.  
她本无意质疑日本人那疯狂的个人礼仪，但这位在“渚之碗”中的新人，如果已经直呼其名，那可真是野心勃勃。就连相田也花了好几个月才走到这一步，主要是因为明日香不断强调不要和那个怪人交朋友。

"Yeah," Shinji answered, having no clue of the minefield he was pissing about in. "He, uh, said I should."  
“嗯，”真嗣回答，完全没意识到自己正踩在雷区上。“他，呃，说我就该这么做。”

_Should?_ Obviously Mr. Nagisa was on too lenient a leash. Let all the sluts in the world try to flirt with him; she wasn't worried about any girl competing. Some unassuming homo from leftfield with musical aspirations and a hangdog demeanor? Yeah. That worried her.  
应该？显然碇先生对渚先生的约束太过宽松了。让全世界的荡妇都来勾引他吧；她并不担心有哪个女孩能与之竞争。但一个来自左翼、怀揣音乐梦想、神情忧郁的同性恋？是的，这让她感到担忧。

"You two seem awfully close," she began.  
"你们俩看起来关系相当亲密啊," 她开口说道。

"We've just spent a lot of time together recently for the film. There are only a few weeks left before the deadline, so we need to work quickly."  
"我们最近为了电影一起度过了很多时间。离截止日期只剩下几周了，所以我们需要快速工作。"

People need to breathe and need to eat. Nobody needs to collaborate on Aida's nerd cinema. "Good luck with that," she said, almost meaning it.  
人们需要呼吸，需要吃饭。没人需要合作艾达的宅电影。“祝你好运，”她说，几乎真心实意。

He thanked her without irony. She rolled her eyes.  
他真诚地向她道谢，没有一丝讽刺。她翻了个白眼。

The door to the room opened and Kaworu entered. He brightened in surprise at seeing his girlfriend.  
房间的门打开了，渚薰走了进来。看到他的女朋友，他惊喜地露出了笑容。

"Hello. Don't you have class right now?" he asked in agreeable confusion.  
“你好。你现在不是应该在上课吗？”他带着友好的困惑问道。

Terrific greeting. Asuka stepped close to scowl at him. "So you don't want to see me."  
极好的问候。明日香走近一步，皱眉瞪着他。“所以你不想见我。”

"Of course I do. I just don't want you to get in trouble."  
“当然想见你。我只是不想你惹上麻烦。”

"The only trouble is me showing up Akagi again." She nodded at the door. "Let's get going."  
“唯一的麻烦就是我再次出现在赤木面前。”她朝门口点了点头。“我们走吧。”

"A moment," Kaworu told her, and walked past her to address Shinji. "I need to step out. Please continue until I return."  
"稍等一下，" 渚薰对她说，然后从她身边走过，向真嗣说道。"我需要出去一下。请继续，直到我回来。"

"Sure. Uh, where's Aida?"  
"当然。呃，相田去哪儿了？"

"He remained with the guitarist we found. Something about helping him with a website."  
"他和我们找到的那个吉他手在一起。好像是在帮他弄个网站什么的。"

Great. One less headache to deal with. Asuka would take any break she could get from Aida's asexual obsession with her.  
太好了。少了一件头疼的事。对于 Aida 对她那无性的痴迷，明日香能躲就躲。

She dragged Kaworu into the hall and turned on him. She stared him down. Or tried to. He just smiled pleasantly at her.  
她把渚薰拽进走廊，转身面对他。她瞪着他，或者说试图瞪着他。他只是愉快地对她微笑。

"You. Me," she began. "We're screwing tonight."  
“你，我，”她开始说，“今晚我们要做爱。”

His interest piqued, but not at the prospect of a sure thing. "Is it an occasion?" He then puzzled over a possible missed anniversary.  
他的兴趣被勾起，但并非因为确定无疑的事情。“这是什么场合吗？”他随后困惑地思索是否错过了某个纪念日。

Asuka put her head in her hands. No blood should have been able to reach his brain at the moment. Why couldn't he just be a guy when it mattered? This was not helping the concept he was settling for her.  
明日香双手抱头。此刻他的血液本不该到达大脑。为什么关键时刻他不能像个男人一样？这无助于他为她设想的观念。

"No," she said. "No, I just… We're doing it tonight, alright? You could act like you're happy."  
“不，”她说。“不，我只是……我们今晚就做，好吗？你可以表现得开心一点。”

"Of course I'm happy to spend time with you."  
“当然，我很高兴能和你共度时光。”

Her head went back in her hands. This was prom night all over again.  
她双手抱头，仿佛又回到了毕业舞会那晚。

He touched her arm and she let him. "Is something the matter?" he asked.  
他轻触她的手臂，她没有拒绝。“有什么事吗？”他问道。

"Everything is fine. Peachy keen." Asuka swallowed anxiety and fear and second thoughts. "Just be ready. I'm going to run you into the ground later."  
"一切都好。完美无缺。" 明日香咽下了焦虑、恐惧和犹豫。"准备好吧。我稍后会让你筋疲力尽的。"

Kaworu hummed a laugh and kissed her forehead just below the hairline. She didn't want to think he was patronizing her, so she didn't. That's right. It was simply his usual carefree carelessness. He may keep everyone, and she meant everyone, within arm's reach, but she was the only one he embraced. Her earlier concerns dissolved a bit into a mushy hash dragging around her feet.  
渚薰轻笑一声，在她发际线下的额头轻轻一吻。她不想认为他在轻视她，所以她没有。没错。这只是他一贯的轻松随意。他或许会让所有人，她的意思是所有人，都保持在伸手可及的范围内，但她是唯一一个被他拥抱的人。她之前的担忧稍稍化作了一滩拖在脚边的软泥。

"Until then," he said. "在那之前，" 他说道。

They parted. And he returned to the music room. She remained in the hallway alone. It wasn't that Asuka felt intentionally tricked, just a little diverted. It was a struggle to stay angry around him. He naturally invited a calming of frayed nerves. She tried to recapture the existential dread gripping her just minutes ago and failed.  
他们分开了。他回到了音乐室。她独自留在走廊里。并非明日香感觉被故意欺骗，只是稍稍分了心。在他身边保持愤怒是件难事。他自然而然地平息了紧张的情绪。她试图重新抓住几分钟前紧紧抓住她的存在主义恐惧，却失败了。

She shrugged. 她耸了耸肩。

Asuka checked her watch. If she hurried she could catch Ibuki on the way out of class to subtly order her to steer clear of their room tonight.  
明日香看了看手表。如果她快点，就能在伊吹下课时悄悄命令她今晚远离他们的房间。

/\/\/\/\

She woke by degrees the next morning with a languid stretch. Warm sunlight poked through the blinds, displaying lazy dust motes floating in the air. At the moment, Asuka did not hate it.  
次日清晨，她带着几分慵懒缓缓醒来，伸了个懒腰。温暖的阳光透过百叶窗，映出空气中缓缓飘动的尘埃。此刻，明日香并不讨厌这一切。

For all the newfound faults Kaworu held, he at least remained great in bed. He possessed a calm, refined confidence but was not above asking for input. He never suggested anything beyond the pale, yet remained open to any of her whims. He always breathed her name when he climaxed.  
尽管卡洛拥有了新发现的缺点，但至少他在床上依然出色。他保持着一种平静、优雅的自信，但也不介意征求意见。他从不提出任何出格的建议，却对她的任何突发奇想都持开放态度。他总是在高潮时呼唤她的名字。

It was more than enough to restore her faith in herself. Yesterday was a memory. Those girls had no clue about her and Kaworu. She wore the pants in this relationship, even when they weren't wearing any pants.  
这足以重燃她对自己的信心。昨天已成为过去。那些女孩对她和卡洛的关系一无所知。在这段关系中，她掌握着主动权，即使他们都没穿裤子。

Asuka rolled out of bed with the usual uncoordinated early morning lethargy. She misjudged the distance to the floor and banged her shoulder against the corner of the nightstand. Her left foot sank into the wastepaper basket. She recoiled and tripped, sprawled over the floor in a heap of dirty clothes and garbage.  
明日香带着清晨惯有的不协调的倦怠从床上滚了下来。她误判了到地面的距离，肩膀撞在了床头柜的角上。左脚陷进了废纸篓里。她向后一缩，绊倒了，整个人摊在地板上，混杂着脏衣服和垃圾。

At least no one saw it. She'd take repressed private humiliation over public any day. She rubbed her sore shoulder and used an old sock to push the trash back into the wastepaper basket. She stopped. She stared. It took a moment for her eyes to convey what she saw to her brain, and for emotion to roar through the stubborn gauzy shroud of sleep.  
至少没人看到这一幕。她宁愿承受压抑的私下羞辱，也不愿在公众面前出丑。她揉了揉酸痛的肩膀，用一只旧袜子把垃圾推回废纸篓。她停了下来。她凝视着。她的眼睛花了些时间才将所见传达给大脑，而情感则穿透了顽固的朦胧睡意。

_"Nagisa!" “渚！”_

White hot fury worked better than any amount of caffeine to jumpstart mental faculties and language abilities. Asuka stormed out of the bedroom into the common kitchen. Kaworu was there making a joke of the coffeemaker again. This time, there were three girls around him, each trying to display their subpar wares. Everyone turned to Asuka's rampage over the dirty carpet.  
炽热的怒火比任何咖啡更能激发心智和语言能力。明日香怒气冲冲地从卧室冲进公共厨房。渚薰又在拿咖啡机开玩笑了。这次，他身边围着三个女孩，每个人都试图展示她们拙劣的才艺。所有人都转向明日香，看着她怒气冲冲地走过肮脏的地毯。

She withered the girls with a look. "Get the fuck out of my sight."  
她用一个眼神就让那些女孩退缩了。"滚出我的视线。"

They were hightailing it by "fuck out."  
她们在"滚出去"的命令下迅速离开。

"Good morning—" he began.  
"早上好——" 他开口道。

She threw it at him. He caught it on reflex with a confused smile. It turned perplexed when he realized what he held.  
她将它扔向他。他条件反射地接住，脸上带着困惑的微笑。当他意识到手里拿着的是什么时，笑容变得困惑不解。

"You know what that is?" she bit out.  
"你知道那是什么吗？" 她咬牙切齿地说。

"It appears to be the condom we used last night."  
"看来是我们昨晚用的那个避孕套。"

"It's the _empty_ condom we used last night. Why the hell would you tie off an empty condom?"  
"这是我们昨晚用过的空避孕套。你他妈为什么要给一个空的避孕套打结？"

She waited for his answer, panting. He opened his mouth.  
她喘着气等待他的回答。他张开了嘴。

"Because—" "因为——"

"Because you…" She took a breath and forced the words out. "Because you _faked_ it last night."  
"因为你…" 她深吸一口气，逼自己说出这些话。"因为你昨晚是装出来的。"

Kaworu paused only a moment. "Yes, but—"  
渚薰只停顿了一瞬。"是的，但是——"

"So you admit it—?!" "所以你承认了——？！"

"—but you told me you get sensitive after you climax, so I stop. I don't mind."  
"——但你说过你高潮后会变得敏感，所以我停下了。我不介意。"

It felt like he punched her. "You mean this isn't the first time?"  
这感觉就像他打了她一拳。“你是说这不是第一次？”

He had to refute it. He had to say it was a fluke. He had better tell her he was fantasizing about some other inferior woman for some bizarre reason. He had to.  
他必须反驳这一点。他必须说那只是个巧合。他最好告诉她，他因为某种奇怪的原因，幻想的是某个其他不如她的女人。他必须这么做。

"I never want to cause you any discomfort," he told her with a gentle smile.  
“我永远不想让你感到任何不适，”他温柔地笑着对她说。

She stared at him. At the boy she loved since junior high; the best friend who comforted her after that disastrous fling with the scruffy gym teacher, the good-natured rival who pushed her to be better than she was, the confidant whose ears were always tuned to her voice, the beautiful angel that made this ugly world full of shoujo manga sparkles and bubbles.  
她凝视着他。从初中起就爱上的那个男孩；那个在她与邋遢的体育老师那段糟糕的恋情后安慰她的挚友，那个总是鼓励她超越自我的好心竞争对手，那个总是倾听她声音的知己，那个让这个丑陋世界充满少女漫画般闪光和泡泡的美丽天使。

At the guy who got along better with her friends than she did. At the infuriatingly calm mediator who never failed to trick her into abandoning a fight. At the know-it-all who always finished the Sunday crossword in ink without hints. At the early riser who still couldn't figure out the coffeemaker. At the honor student with the effortless 4.0 GPA. At the free ride scholarship musician who played by ear without any formal training. At the competitor who she bitterly admitted never stopped improving even when she did. At the adored public idol who was settling for her. At the faker.  
对着那个与她朋友们相处得比她还融洽的家伙。对着那个令人恼火地冷静的调解者，他总能巧妙地让她放弃争吵。对着那个无所不知的人，他总是用墨水完成周日填字游戏，无需任何提示。对着那个早起的人，他仍然搞不懂咖啡机怎么用。对着那个轻松保持 4.0 GPA 的优等生。对着那个靠奖学金学音乐的人，他凭耳朵演奏，未经任何正规训练。对着那个竞争对手，她不得不承认，即使她停滞不前，他也从未停止进步。对着那个备受公众喜爱的偶像，他选择了她。对着那个伪装者。

"We need to break up," Asuka said.  
“我们需要分手，”明日香说。

"Why?" “为什么？”

She had, on occasion, tried to imagine how Kaworu would react to adverse events concerning their relationship. Academic transfers. Family tragedies. Pregnancy scares. The last and next ten years' Sexiest Man Alive deciding to court her at once. In every instance, she fancied some visceral, raw _human_ emotion from him as he valiantly strove to keep them together. Looking back, she should have expected what she got: calm, pragmatic, unoffended patience.  
她曾试图想象过，当他们的关系遭遇逆境时，渚薰会有何反应。学术转学、家庭悲剧、怀孕惊吓，甚至是过去和未来十年《最性感男人》榜单上的两位同时向她求爱。在每一种情况下，她都幻想他会展现出某种本能的、原始的人类情感，勇敢地努力维系他们的关系。回想起来，她本应预料到她所得到的：冷静、务实、不受冒犯的耐心。

"Because," she said, "I am not some fragile little girl that needs to be lied to. I am not a delicate flower you need to shelter. I am _Asuka Langley Soryu_ and you do _not_ know what is best for me."  
“因为，”她说，“我不是需要被谎言保护的脆弱小女孩。我不是你需要呵护的娇嫩花朵。我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，你并不知道什么对我最好。”

"Let's talk about this." “我们谈谈吧。”

_No,_ she thought. He was not going to defuse the bomb this time.  
不，她想。这次他不会拆除炸弹了。

"Fuck _talking_." She remembered him breathing her name last night. "How can I believe anything you say? Why should I? I'm not going to spend my time with someone who coddles and lies to me like a goddamned baby. Your arrogant divine protection isn't doing jack shit except propping up your own need to be everyone's perfect martyr. I'm sick of your messiah complex. How could anyone be happy supporting that?!"  
"去他妈的谈话。" 她记得昨晚他呼吸中呼唤她的名字。"我怎么能相信你说的任何话？为什么要相信？我不会把时间浪费在一个像对待该死的小孩一样溺爱和欺骗我的人身上。你那自以为是的神圣保护除了满足你自己成为每个人完美殉道者的需求外，什么也没做。我受够了你的弥赛亚情结。支持这种事，谁能快乐得起来？！"

"You're not happy?" he asked. He sounded almost upset.  
"你不快乐吗？" 他问。听起来几乎有些难过。

"No!" she blurted. "不！"她脱口而出。

She had to burn this bridge. Burn it so badly the interior department deemed it a biohazard and cordoned off the site for generations.  
她必须烧毁这座桥。烧得如此彻底，以至于内政部门认为它成了生物危害区，将该地封锁了数代之久。

Kaworu looked affected. "I want you to be happy."  
渚薰看起来受到了触动。"我希望你能幸福。"

"Then stay the hell out of my face, you _faking fuck!"_  
"那就滚远点，你这个虚伪的混蛋！"

She was panting through her teeth, eyes wide and wild.  
她咬着牙喘息，眼睛瞪得大大的，充满了狂野。

At length his gaze left hers, he turned from the kitchen and returned to her dorm room. She distantly heard him getting dressed.  
最终，他移开了目光，转身离开了厨房，回到了她的宿舍房间。她隐约听到他在穿衣服的声音。

She clawed at the counter for support. The room was spinning. Her body was light and disobedient. She gritted her teeth against her stomach. Regaining control of her life wasn't supposed to feel this bad.  
她用爪子似的双手抓着柜台以寻求支撑。房间在旋转。她的身体轻飘飘的，不听使唤。她咬紧牙关对抗着胃部的翻腾。重新掌控自己的生活本不该感觉这么糟糕。

Kaworu emerged from her room and paused in the hallway behind her. He drew a breath.  
渚薰从她的房间里走出来，在走廊上停在她身后。他深吸了一口气。

"Asuka—" he started. “明日香——”他开口道。

She grabbed the empty coffee pot and hurled it at him. He deftly caught it and set it on the floor. When he rose the impression of regret flitted over his features. He turned and without another word left the dorm.  
她抓起空咖啡壶朝他扔去。他灵巧地接住，放在地上。当他起身时，脸上掠过一丝悔意。他转身，一言不发地离开了宿舍。

Asuka was alone. She pushed away from the counter. Her head swam only a moment. Exhaustion wrapped around her and dragged her towards bed.  
明日香独自一人。她从柜台旁退开。只觉一阵头晕目眩。疲惫感紧紧缠绕着她，将她拖向床铺。

She almost tripped over the coffee pot. Asuka kicked it as hard as she could across the kitchen.  
她差点被咖啡壶绊倒。明日香用尽全力一脚将它踢飞过厨房。

/\/\/\/\

The Beast was not the bar for raucous frat boys or obnoxious sluts. It was not the bar for gleefully exclusive parties celebrating the merits of a student film festival winner and his team. It was a bar for the quiet appreciation of alcohol. The crushing weight of watching your life unravel was just an unfortunate side effect of entering alone. Its subdued atmosphere, the whispering vinyl jukebox in the corner, and the weathered acoustic guitar mounted over the exit did not mark it as a rowdy twenty-something hotspot to get hammered in. Here, alcohol was a memory-eroding crutch, not a whitewater slip-and-slide to STD-laden regret.  
野兽酒吧并非喧闹的兄弟会男孩或讨厌的荡妇聚集之地。它也不是为庆祝学生电影节获奖者及其团队成就而举办的欢乐独占派对的场所。这是一家供人静心品味酒精的酒吧。独自踏入这里，目睹生活分崩离析的重压只是一种不幸的副作用。它那低调的氛围、角落里低语般的黑胶唱片点唱机，以及出口上方悬挂的磨损木吉他，并未将其标榜为二十多岁年轻人狂欢畅饮的热门之地。在这里，酒精是抹去记忆的拐杖，而非通往性病缠身的悔恨之白水滑梯。

Asuka sat alone at the front bar, elbows on the polished counter, three long sips into lovely dark brown oblivion. Her stool, and everyone knew it was Her stool for the past two months, was not the most welcoming seat for someone lacking extra baggage in the rear but it was closest to the alcohol. And tonight she needed a lot of it.  
明日香独自坐在前吧台，手肘撑在光亮的台面上，三次深饮后沉醉于美妙的深褐色世界。她的高脚凳，过去两个月里大家都知道是她的专座，对于臀部缺乏额外负担的人来说并不太友好，但它离酒精最近。而今晚，她需要很多很多酒。

Campus was abuzz with the triumph of Aida's student film at the annual festival, sweeping first place in categories from directing to score. And acting, as a weird foreign transfer with glasses took the spotlight with her star-making performance as the movie's hot-blooded heroine. The role Aida wrote for her, Asuka bitterly reminded herself. How dare some nobody from some backwater country steal her thunder. How dare Aida not scrap the project when Asuka refused to star in it. How dare the world keep moving without her. She drained her glass.  
校园里洋溢着艾达学生电影在年度电影节上大获全胜的喜悦，从导演到配乐各奖项一网打尽。而那位戴着眼镜、来自异国的转学生，以她那让星光熠熠的表演，成为了电影中热血女主角的化身，吸引了所有目光。这个角色，是艾达为她量身打造的，明日香苦涩地提醒自己。一个来自偏远国家的无名小卒，怎么敢抢走她的风头。艾达怎么敢在她拒绝主演后不取消这个项目。世界怎么敢在她缺席的情况下继续运转。她一饮而尽。

The bar's door opened with a gentle rattle. Someone approached.  
酒吧的门轻轻地响了一声，打开了。有人走了过来。

"Mr. Aoba," he addressed the bartender with a short wave.  
“青叶先生，”他向调酒师挥了挥手，简短地打了个招呼。

He looked up from stereotypically wiping a shot glass dry. "Hey, Mr. Ikari. What on earth are you doing in my dive tonight? You should be out living it up, Mr. Composer."  
他从典型地擦干一个酒杯的动作中抬起头来。“嘿，碇先生。你今晚怎么会来我的小酒吧？你应该在外面尽情享受，作曲家先生。”

Shinji smiled self-consciously. "It was actually getting a bit crowded at Aida's party. I wanted to say thank you again for playing with us on the score. And to give you a copy." He handed over a flash drive.  
真嗣有些不好意思地笑了笑。“相田的派对其实有点挤了。我想再次感谢你为我们配乐的合作。并给你一份副本。”他递过一个闪存盘。

"So I didn't butcher the piece completely?"  
“所以我没把那曲子完全搞砸？”

"No, no. You sounded excellent. That Spanish guitar you brought worked great for the tango scene."  
"不，不。你弹得非常好。你带来的那把西班牙吉他非常适合探戈场景。"

"Good. I didn't want to screw it up for Aida. He helped me set up The Beast's website. Tell him I'm glad everything worked out."  
"很好。我不想搞砸给艾达的事。他帮我搭建了野兽的网站。告诉他我很高兴一切顺利。"

Asuka, slouched over the bar, flourished her empty glass at him. "I'm not paying you to run your jaw at the locals, Mr. Booze Bunny. Give me a refill."  
明日香趴在吧台上，向他晃了晃空杯子。"我可不是付钱让你跟当地人闲聊的，酒兔先生。给我续杯。"

Aoba offered a wry wave and plucked a slim bottle from the shelf behind him. "Of course, Ms. Soryu."  
青叶苦笑着挥了挥手，从身后的架子上取下一瓶细长的酒瓶。“当然，草薙小姐。”

"Soryu?" Shinji finally bothered to notice the pile of misery warming the stool beside him. "Ms. Soryu?"  
“草薙？”真嗣终于注意到旁边凳子上那团暖洋洋的忧郁。“草薙小姐？”

"I know you?" “我认识你吗？”

"Uh, it's me, Shinji Ikari? We met twice before."  
"呃，是我，碇真嗣？我们之前见过两次。"

"Lucky you." She started on her refreshed drink. "You obviously remember me."  
"你真幸运。" 她开始喝她重新倒的饮料。"你显然记得我。"

"Of course. Soryu's a pretty famous name."  
"当然。惣流这个名字相当有名。"

"Yeah, yeah," Asuka grumbled. "I'm the daughter of _the_ Kyoko Zeppelin Soryu. Hold your applause, please."  
“是是是，”明日香咕哝道，“我是飞艇苍龙响子的女儿。请别鼓掌了。”

"Oh, uh, no. I meant the Soryu who completed the medical admissions exam at sixteen, but opted to stay in high school. I still remember that."  
“哦，呃，不是。我是说那个十六岁就通过了医学院入学考试，却选择留在高中的苍龙。我还记得那件事。”

She sat a little straighter. Where her mother decried the move of taking the test for the sole purpose of turning it down as egotistically shortsighted, Shinji sounded awestruck. Even Kaworu had gently questioned her for sticking around grade school.  
她坐得更直了些。她母亲曾批评这种为了拒绝而参加考试的行为是自负且短视的，但真嗣听上去却满是敬畏。就连渚薰也曾温和地问她为何要留在学校。

Asuka glanced at him. "You heard about that?"  
明日香瞥了他一眼。“你听说了吗？”

"Of course. I thought it was really amazing that someone wanted to remain grounded in a normal high school instead of showing off by skipping to university."  
“当然。我真觉得不可思议，居然有人愿意脚踏实地在普通高中学习，而不是炫耀般地跳级上大学。”

Well, let him think that.  
“好吧，就让他这么想吧。”

"Why don't you have a seat?" she posed, nodding at the forever empty stool beside her.  
“为什么不坐下呢？”她提议道，向她身边永远空着的凳子点了点头。

Shinji's brain misfired. "Really?"  
真嗣的大脑一片空白。“真的吗？”

And she already regretted it. "If you have something more important to attend to…"  
而她已经开始后悔了。“如果你有更重要的事情要处理……”

"Uh, no. I mean, thanks." He sat. After a moment, he ordered.  
"呃，不。我是说，谢谢。" 他坐了下来。过了一会儿，他点了单。

She snorted at his selection. "Yebisu? That cheap swill?"  
她对他的选择嗤之以鼻。"惠比寿？那种廉价货？"

"When I was a kid my babysitter used to let me sneak sips." He took a gulp and smiled to himself. "It's nostalgic, I guess."  
"小时候我的保姆常让我偷偷尝一口。" 他喝了一大口，自顾自地笑了。"大概是怀旧吧。"

Asuka tried to stay awake. The Japanese probably considered it rude to doze off in the middle of a conversation.  
明日香努力保持清醒。日本人大概认为在谈话中打瞌睡是很失礼的。

Her phone buzzed and she blearily checked who it was. Hikari was yet again trying to contact her, briefly communicating concern over her wellbeing. This was a periodic occurrence since The Great Breakup, Hikari going so far as to try and reconcile the two. That ended with an extended trip to The Beast.  
她的手机嗡嗡作响，她迷迷糊糊地查看是谁。又是光子在试图联系她，简短地表达对她健康的担忧。自从那次大分手后，这种情况时有发生，光子甚至试图调和两人的关系。结果是她去了一趟“野兽”那里，事情才告一段落。

For someone like Hikari, doomed to a life of servitude and childrearing, to pretend to know better than Asuka and meddle in her personal affairs was beyond the pale. How dare she. It only served to steel Asuka's resolve. She was in control, and woe be it to the fool who thought otherwise.  
像光子这样注定要过上仆役和育儿生活的人，竟然自以为比明日香更懂，还插手她的私事，真是太过分了。她怎么敢。这只会让明日香更加坚定自己的决心。她掌控一切，任何妄图质疑这一点的人都将自食其果。

"Everything okay?" Shinji asked, watching her face.  
“一切都好吗？” 真嗣问道，注视着她的脸。

"Just some moron from class," she lied, tucking the phone away. "Which could be anyone in class." She peered at him. "What are you taking here, anyway?"  
“只是班上某个白痴，”她撒谎道，把手机收起来。“班上谁都有可能。”她盯着他。“你在这里学什么来着？”

He told her his major was Theoretical Chemistry. She asked him to explain it. He did. She asked him to stop explaining it.  
他告诉她自己的专业是理论化学。她让他解释一下。他解释了。她让他别再解释了。

"Sorry," he said. "I guess the technical stuff is kind of boring."  
"对不起，"他说。"我想这些技术性的东西有点无聊。"

All of it was boring. But it was definitely no ordinary field. He probably had any number of post-grad and employment opportunities already awaiting him. It proved he was intelligent and talented, but in a very narrow, impossibly specialized way. Not like her intelligence and talent, which excelled at traversing boundaries. Let him be good at something nobody really understood or needed. Let him be content with that.  
所有这些都很枯燥。但这绝对不是普通的领域。他可能已经有许多研究生学位和就业机会在等着他了。这证明他既聪明又有才华，但只是在非常狭窄、极其专业化的方面。不像她的智慧和才能，擅长跨越界限。让他擅长一些没人真正理解或需要的东西吧。让他满足于此。

"I'm a bit jealous of you," Shinji admitted. "All I can do is research. You're going into a field that'll help people directly. But it seems very difficult."  
"我有点嫉妒你，"真嗣承认道。"我只能做研究。你要进入的领域能直接帮助人们。但这似乎非常困难。"

Difficult if she didn't have Mama drilling the information into her since toddler years. By now it was little more than rote information regurgitated on command for examinations. But even that required an elite's skill. At least Ikari recognized it.  
若非从小妈妈就不断向她灌输这些知识，恐怕会很难。如今这些不过是应试时机械复述的死记硬背罢了。但即便如此，也需要精英般的技巧。至少碇真嗣意识到了这一点。

"It isn't something just anyone could do."  
“这可不是随便谁都能做到的事。”

The empty cans and glasses piled up. They alternated leaning over the bar and on each other. His shoulder was broad and warm, if a little bony. Studying him now through a soft prescription of booze goggles without anyone else to compare him to, he wasn't a total waste of humanity. Just a partial waste. At least his jaw wasn't weak and his eyes weren't terrible.  
空罐和杯子堆积如山。他们时而倚靠在吧台上，时而相互依偎。他的肩膀宽阔而温暖，虽然略显骨感。此刻借着微醺的酒意细细打量他，没有其他人在旁比较，他还不算完全浪费了人类的资源。只是部分浪费。至少他的下巴不显弱，眼睛也不糟糕。

"You got a girlfriend, Akari?"  
"你有女朋友了吗，Akari？"

He tried to grin. "Not since high school."  
他试图咧嘴笑。"高中以后就没有了。"

"Oh?" His tone communicated a story behind that.  
"哦？"他的语气暗示着背后的故事。

"Yeah… Uh, it got kind of weird with her."  
“是啊……呃，和她在一起有点怪怪的。”

Certainly weirdness would be a benefit in dating him. "Like, she was an S&M stalker?"  
确实，和他约会奇怪点反而是好事。“比如，她是个 S&M 跟踪狂？”

He blushed brightly, but laughed. "Mana just got… weird."  
他脸红得厉害，但还是笑了。“Mana 就是变得……怪怪的。”

She was positive he was a virgin when they first met and felt reassured when they spoke a second time. Now she began to think his shuffling bashfulness was chronic and not entirely related to her own magnificent sexiness. Which was both disappointing and offensive.  
她确信他们初次见面时他还是个处男，再次交谈时她感到安心。现在她开始认为他那局促不安的羞涩是长期的，并不完全与她自身的非凡魅力有关。这既令人失望又有些冒犯。

But there was no possible way anyone could ever look at him and say he was settling for a girl like Asuka. She was so far out of his league she was in an entirely different sport. And while he was awkward and boring and weak, he still possessed enough particular, obscure merits to justify existence, at least compared to the rest of his peers. And Asuka's greatness was so great, even being near someone like him wouldn't tarnish her. She wasn't lowering herself, she was raising him up.  
但任何人都不可能看着他然后说他满足于像明日香这样的女孩。她远超他的级别，简直是在完全不同的领域。尽管他笨拙、无趣且软弱，他仍拥有一些特殊而隐晦的优点，至少相对于他的同龄人来说，这些足以证明他的存在合理。而明日香的伟大如此之甚，即使接近他这样的人也不会玷污她。她不是在降低自己，而是在提升他。

She polished off another glass.  
她又喝干了一杯。

"So you're not a fan of the S&M weird," she said. Which was weird itself. She had him pegged as a deviant. "What are you a fan of?"  
"这么说你不喜欢那种 SM 的怪异，"她说道。这本身就很奇怪。她曾认为他是个变态。"那你喜欢什么？"

Shinji blinked through a few beers to seriously consider the question. "I guess… someone smart and talented. Someone confident who knows where they're going. Someone who isn't afraid." He spoke with genuine longing, and looked at her. "You know someone, Ms. Soryu?"  
真嗣在几杯啤酒后认真思考了这个问题。"我想……我喜欢聪明又有才华的人。自信且知道自己方向的人。无所畏惧的人。"他带着真挚的渴望说道，并看着她。"你知道这样的人吗，惣流小姐？"

She appraised him. She allowed him to see a slow smile.  
她打量着他。她让他看到了一个缓慢的微笑。

"Call me Asuka." "叫我明日香。"

_"Asuka!" "明日香！"_

He groaned her name like a dying beast as she patiently waited for him to ride it out. His nails clawed deep into her dirty comforter, his back arched, his entire body shuddered and strained in perfect ecstasy.  
他像垂死的野兽般呻吟着她的名字，而她耐心地等待着他度过这一刻。他的指甲深深陷入她肮脏的被单中，背部拱起，全身颤抖着，在极度的快感中挣扎。

_No faking that,_ she thought.  
这可没法假装，她心想。

He leaned over her, sweaty hair in disarray, his flushed face full of import and meaning. The sinking feeling he would declare his love took hold. Instead he kissed her, entirely too tentatively to convey anything.  
他俯身向她，汗水打湿的头发凌乱不堪，涨红的脸庞满是重要与深意。她心中一沉，以为他会宣告爱意。然而他只是轻轻吻了她，那般小心翼翼，根本无法传达任何情感。

He rolled beside her and they were quiet in the dark. She listened to his ragged breath gradually return to normal, a soft steady white noise lulling her into a distracted haze until the last six minutes of awkward fumbling felt like a million years ago. She stared at the ceiling listening to his inhalation slow until she was positive he was asleep. She sighed and shut her eyes.  
他翻身躺到她身旁，两人在黑暗中静默无言。她听着他急促的呼吸逐渐平复，柔和稳定的白噪音让她陷入恍惚，仿佛最后那六分钟的尴尬摸索已是亿万年前的事。她凝视着天花板，听着他的呼吸渐渐放缓，确信他已入睡。她叹了口气，闭上了眼睛。

He turned to her. 他转向她。

"Can we do it again?" he asked.  
“我们能再来一次吗？”他问道。

_How disgusting,_ she thought.  
真恶心，她心想。

/\/\/\/\

She woke up before her alarm. She woke up alone. The shadow of outrage over both occurrences mingled until nothing but a vague sense of overall dissatisfaction remained.  
她比闹钟醒得还早。醒来时，身边空无一人。这两件事引发的愤怒阴影交织在一起，最终只留下一种模糊的、整体的不满感。

Asuka got out of bed gingerly, sore and frustrated. She plucked a loose shirt from the floor and shrugged into it. His clothes were gone.  
明日香小心翼翼地下了床，感到酸痛和沮丧。她从地上捡起一件松散的衬衫，套在身上。他的衣服已经不见了。

The dorm halls were quiet and empty, the kitchen was deserted except for Shinji. No sluts chatted him up as he poked around with a sickly grimace, like he'd catch something just by looking at all the dirty dishes and old food. He noticed her at the edge of the kitchen and cautiously brightened.  
宿舍走廊静悄悄的，空无一人，厨房里也只有真嗣。没有那些轻浮的女孩围着他搭讪，他带着病态的苦笑，仿佛光是看着那些脏盘子和剩菜就会染上什么似的。他在厨房的一角注意到她，谨慎地露出了笑容。

"Oh, good morning," he said, coloring. He glanced towards the open cabinets. "Sorry. I wanted to make breakfast for you, but, uh, supplies seem to be limited."  
“哦，早上好。”他有些脸红地说道，目光瞥向敞开的橱柜。“抱歉。我想给你做早餐，但是，呃，食材似乎有限。”

_Jesus fucking Christ,_ Asuka thought in revulsion. What was wrong with this guy? What the hell possessed her last night? What sort of milquetoast limp sack of effeminately domesticated shit made Asuka Langley Soryu breakfast in bed?  
耶稣他妈的基督啊，明日香厌恶地想。这家伙怎么回事？昨晚她到底是被什么鬼迷心窍了？什么样的软弱无力的娘娘腔废物会让惣流·明日香·葛城在床上吃早餐？

Definitely not her next boyfriend. She resolved to kick him out, or kick his ass, or both concurrently, and chalk this entire debacle up to too much good alcohol. Which she would need to promptly forget all this with even more, even better alcohol.  
绝对不会是她的下一任男友。她决心把他赶出去，或者揍他一顿，或者两者同时进行，然后把这一切荒唐事归咎于喝多了好酒。她需要立即用更多、更好的酒来忘掉这一切。

En route to his violent removal from her life she stopped. She cocked her head. She stared at him. She slowly approached.  
在他即将被暴力逐出她生活的那一刻，她停下了。她歪着头，凝视着他，缓缓靠近。

"Even coffee…" he went on. "There's plenty here but the maker is a mess. The filter hasn't been cleaned in days and the pot is stained and cracked—"  
“就连咖啡……”他继续说道，“这里有很多，但咖啡机一团糟。滤网已经好几天没清洗了，咖啡壶也满是污渍和裂痕——”

"Shut up," she ordered. “闭嘴，”她命令道。

He obeyed. Asuka stepped very close, cornering him in against the counter and sink. She peered at him. He gulped at the proximity, looking for escape.  
他顺从了。明日香步步逼近，将他逼至厨房的角落和水槽边。她凝视着他。他因这近距离而紧张地吞咽，寻找着逃脱的机会。

There. Right there. Along the jaw line shadowing his chin. Like sexy pepper on the bland ice cold bowl of soup that was Shinji Ikari: stubble.  
就在那儿。沿着下巴的轮廓，投下阴影。就像在平淡无味的冰冷汤碗上撒上性感的胡椒粉——碇真嗣的胡茬。

It took all of her early morning faculties to refrain from having at it right there and then. For all his confidence and ability, Kaworu was always as smooth shaven as the day he was born. Facial hair became a private fetish she resolved to give up on years ago.  
她用尽清晨的所有自制力，才忍住当时当地就扑上去的冲动。尽管他自信且有能力，渚薰总是保持着出生时的光滑剃净。面部毛发成了她多年前决心放弃的私人癖好。

Asuka rethought her course of action.  
明日香重新考虑了她的行动方案。

Shinji swallowed audibly. "… S-So about the food and—"  
真嗣明显地咽了口唾沫。“……那，关于食物和——”

"Forget about that," she snapped. She backed off a step and glanced away, angry over blushing. "There's never anything to eat in this dump."  
“别提那个了，”她厉声打断。她后退了一步，目光移开，对自己脸红感到恼火。“这破地方从来没什么可吃的。”

"O-Oh." "哦-哦。"

"So… let's go out to eat."  
"那么…我们去外面吃饭吧。"

"Oh." “哦。”

He would never overshadow her. If anything, he might get lost in hers. Shinji was no threat to her superiority; the pants were back where they belonged. He was deferent and tame and trainable. He was safe. He had stubble.  
他永远不会盖过她的风头。如果有的话，他可能会迷失在她的光芒中。真嗣对她没有威胁；裤子又回到了它们该在的地方。他顺从、温顺且可训练。他是安全的。他有胡茬。

And he was fine for now.  
目前他感觉还不错。

They headed for the dorm's exit together. He absently scratched at his jaw. He frowned.  
他们一起朝宿舍出口走去。他心不在焉地挠了挠下巴，皱起了眉头。

"Say, could I run back to my dorm and shave real quick?" he asked.  
“我说，我能回宿舍快速刮个胡子吗？”他问道。

"No," she told him. “不，”她告诉他。

End 结束

Author notes: Asuka in college, attempt number two. I think this one turned out a bit better. The crack pairing of Asuka/Kaworu was surprisingly endearing to write.  
作者笔记：大学时期的明日香，第二次尝试。我觉得这次写得稍微好一些。明日香与渚薰这对意外的组合写起来竟然相当动人。

Just to be absolutely, painfully clear: this was meant to be tongue-in-cheek. Like Soloist was supposed to be. I have trouble conveying tone in-piece. So instead of working at that failing I'll take the easy way out.  
只是为了绝对、痛苦地明确一点：这是为了幽默而写的。就像《独奏者》本意也是要幽默的。我在作品中传达语气方面有困难。所以与其努力克服这个失败，我选择了走捷径。

Kane means "bell." I think. I thought it sounded cute. And yes, four-year-olds _can_ direct like that.  
Kane 意为“铃”。我想是的。我觉得这听起来很可爱。没错，四岁小孩也能那样指挥。

[Panther2G](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4474090/Panther2G):
Crack as The Soloist it might be, but still an entertaining and wild ride. Kaworu humoring her along for years out of a detached desire for her to be happy is oddly fitting for him. Asuka latching onto Shinji out of a facial hair fetish is somewhere between weird and hilarious.  
虽然作为《独奏者》可能有些瑕疵，但依然是一段娱乐性十足且狂野的旅程。渚薰多年来出于一种超然的愿望，逗她开心，对他来说颇为贴切。明日香因为对须藤的胡须迷恋而紧抓他不放，这种情节既怪异又滑稽。  
  
She's certainly an amazing level of misanthropic bitch in both these college pieces. Though here it gives a feeling like her canon fears of intimacy and letting anyone close have hardened into a permanent state of prickly bitchiness that is slowly turning her into a utter isolate heading for a lonely life of bitter anger and resentment at the whole world as she slowly curdles inside. In a more hopeful setting I might wonder if Shinji would help her change course out of that, but here I'm not sure he'd have the strength to hold on, or Asuka the courage and will to do so.  
在这两篇大学作品中，她确实展现出了惊人的厌世和刻薄。尽管如此，这给人一种感觉，她对亲密关系和让人接近的恐惧已经硬化成了一种永久的、尖锐的刻薄状态，使她逐渐变成一个彻底的孤立者，走向孤独、充满愤怒和怨恨的生活，随着内心的逐渐腐化，她对整个世界都充满了苦涩的愤怒和怨恨。在一个更有希望的环境中，我可能会想，须藤是否能帮助她改变方向，但在这里，我不确定他是否有坚持下去的力量，或者明日香是否有勇气和意志去这样做。  
  
But then, if I want WAFF, I kick myself back into gear and get back to work on A&T. I can always strike terror into the hearts of my readers by telling them I'm reading your works for ideas. :)  
但若我渴望温馨甜蜜（WAFF），我便会自我激励，重新投入到《A&T》的创作中。我总能通过告诉读者我正在阅读你们的大作以获取灵感，来让他们心生恐惧。 :)  
  
This was well worth the read, and I eagerly await whatever you do next, as ever.  
这篇作品读来绝对值得，我一如既往地热切期待你接下来的任何创作。

[Seeking Professional Help](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4939122/Seeking-Professional-Help): 
Thanks for the new story.  
感谢您的新作。  
  
I usually like the way write Asuka in your stories, the way she is bitchy and arrogant with the other characters is very entertaining to read, but I find college Asuka to be foul. Although it could just be my opinion of colleges is so low these days, that it is effecting my judgement of her.  
我通常喜欢你在故事中描写明日香的方式，她对其他角色刻薄和傲慢的样子非常有趣，但我觉得大学时期的明日香很讨厌。虽然这可能只是因为我对大学的看法最近变得很低，影响了我的判断。  
  
Even though I am not routing for college Asuka as a character anytime soon, I still liked the story.  
尽管我暂时不会支持大学时期的明日香这个角色，但我仍然喜欢这个故事。  
Thanks for writing. 感谢您的创作。

[Glory-To-Our-August-King](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4279126/Glory-To-Our-August-King): Honestly, Soloist is still one of my favorites. I'd always imagined Asuka/Kaworu would be fun to write, if nothing else than because of his calm aloofness. It was certainly enjoyable to read and it felt like there was more of a focus on dialogue in this piece, or maybe I'm remembering Soloist as more wordy, I guess. Either way, this feels like a tighter piece of storytelling, although I'm a fan of a more meandering pace. Personal preferences aside, this was another excellent dive into College Asuka. Well done. 
老实说，Soloist 依然是我最喜欢的之一。我一直觉得写明日香/渚薰会很有趣，至少因为他的那种冷静超然。读起来确实很享受，感觉这篇更侧重对话，或者可能是我记忆中 Soloist 更啰嗦吧，我也不确定。无论如何，这篇故事显得更紧凑，尽管我个人偏爱更悠闲的节奏。抛开个人喜好不谈，这又是一次对大学时期明日香的精彩探索。做得好。

[TheINFERNO95](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8308295/TheINFERNO95):
I put off reading this fic cause I knew toward the end you would have A&S fucking each other and what the point reading a fic if you already know the crappy ending? Your story are becoming predictable due you not being creative anymore or selling out just so jerkoff writers like panter2g can praise your story? But I notice for a while like all the others you are obsess whit seeing these toxic brats in a toxic relationship cause everyone in eva think those kind of relationship are cute and fun to read about. Opposite may attract but it wont last unless the two people have positive things in common. There a reason why those two never got along. Asuka is driven, seek attention and want to move on while soy boy is lazy, wine too much and give up on anything he can't handle. At some point one is gonna snap on the other, which is what happened in when shinji strangle asuka.  
我推迟阅读这篇同人文，因为我知道到最后你会让真嗣和明日香发生关系，既然已经知道这糟糕的结局，那还有什么读下去的意义呢？你的故事变得越来越可预测，是因为你不再有创意，还是为了迎合像 panter2g 这样的自慰作家而卖弄故事？但我注意到，像其他人一样，你沉迷于描绘这些有毒的孩子们陷入有毒的关系，因为《EVA》里的每个人都认为这种关系既可爱又有趣。相反的特质可能会相互吸引，但除非两个人有积极的共同点，否则这种关系不会持久。他们俩从未合得来的原因在于，明日香积极进取，渴望关注并想要继续前进，而真嗣则懒惰、酗酒且对任何他无法应对的事情轻易放弃。总有一天，其中一方会爆发，就像真嗣掐住明日香那样。  
  
Asuka is in for a world of hurt if she want a guy to never tell her the harsh truth about herself. She will never grow up, become a strong person nor learn how the world work being whit a weak loser. Shinji would never tell her the truth, never help her nor be there when she need him. Yet all everybody want to do is read or write sleazy fics whit them fucking each other just to make themselves happy. If this how you gonna write collage fics whit asuka fucking shinji all the time, then I'm not reading them cause it just a waste of time. As if there are not enough sleazy fic on the net like this.  
如果明日香想要一个永远不会告诉她残酷真相的男人，那她将陷入无尽的痛苦之中。她永远不会成长，不会变得坚强，也不会学会这个世界的运作方式，因为她身边是一个软弱的失败者。真嗣永远不会告诉她真相，永远不会帮助她，也永远不会在她需要时出现。然而，所有人都只想读或写那些下流的同人文，让他们互相做爱只是为了让自己开心。如果这就是你们要写的大学同人文，让明日香不停地和真嗣做爱，那我就不读了，因为这只是浪费时间。好像网上这样的下流同人文还不够多似的。  
  
The kensuke bashing is getting old. It clear you think him and her as a couple is a joke like everyone else seem to think. I can read other fic whit her trashing kensuke for no reason, I don't need to read crap like this from you. It bad enough you write fics where he has feeling for her but she don't give a damn cause she obsess whit a jagoff who like to strangle her when...ah forget it.  
对健介的抨击已经过时了。很明显，你认为他和她在一起是个笑话，就像其他人似乎也这么认为一样。我可以读其他同人文，里面她无缘无故地抨击健介，我不需要从你这里读到这种垃圾。你写的同人文里，他明明对她有感情，但她根本不在乎，因为她迷恋一个喜欢掐她脖子的混蛋……算了，不说了。

[jin0uga](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3822481/jin0uga): I love how you write these characters. Certainly, her personality and general demenor is disgusting to stomach, but that's the beauty of it. This is very evangelion. I love it. Thank you for writing such a story.  
我喜欢你笔下的这些角色。确实，她的性格和一般举止令人难以忍受，但这就是其魅力所在。这非常《新世纪福音战士》。我非常喜欢。感谢你创作了这样一个故事。

[Martyr Mcjones](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/13422471/Martyr-Mcjones): Re:TheINFERNO95. "toxic brats in a toxic relationship" this is one of the best reviews of a AsuShin fanfiction, of all time
