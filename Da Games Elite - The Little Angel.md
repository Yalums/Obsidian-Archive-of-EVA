What you are about to read is in no way connected to my previous Fan-Fiction, "In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu," which I still recommend you read because, in my opinion, I think it touches upon a certain aspect of the series that people usually don't touch upon: why don't these damn kids just get psychologists to help them with their problems? Well, that not withstanding, I've wanted to find fan-fics where Asuka and Shinji finally confront the horrors of parenthood, and considering just what their parents were like, one having a rather cold and distant father and the other's mother committing suicide in front of her eyes, it left much potential not only to do a great Asuka fan-fic, but also a great Shinji fan-fic as well. Naturally, considering the subject matter, there will be several OCs, but they'll mostly be children.  
你即将阅读的内容与我之前的同人小说《浅谈惣流·明日香·兰格雷的个案》并无任何关联，我仍推荐你阅读，因为在我看来，它触及了该系列中人们通常不涉及的一个方面：这些孩子为何不寻求心理学家帮助解决他们的问题？尽管如此，我一直想找到关于明日香和真嗣最终直面育儿恐怖的同人作品，考虑到他们的父母分别是怎样的人——一个有着冷漠疏离的父亲，另一个的母亲则在眼前自杀，这不仅为创作一部优秀的明日香同人提供了广阔空间，也为真嗣同人开辟了同样广阔的可能性。当然，鉴于主题，会有一些原创角色，但大部分会是孩子。

WARNING: Despite being rated T, there is a very mild, PG-13 level sex scene in the next chapter. This is not a lemon, not a hentai, and the sex will barely count as ecchi. It's more essentially to show the beauty of the human body, and just how two certain characters get into this situation in the first place. If you feel uncomfortable about it, gloss over it. If you're into that sort of stuff, like lemons, I'm sorry, but I want this to reach the general audience.  
警告：尽管评级为 T，下一章中包含一个非常温和的 PG-13 级别性爱场景。这不是柠檬文，不是 hentai，性爱内容几乎算不上是 ecchi。其主要目的是展现人体之美，以及两位特定角色是如何陷入这种情境的。如果你对此感到不适，可以选择略过。如果你喜欢柠檬文这类内容，很抱歉，但我希望这部作品能面向更广泛的读者。

So, without further adieu…  
那么，不再多说……

### **THE LITTLE ANGEL 小天使**

**BY DA GAMES ELITE 由游戏精英创作**

**Part 1 第一部分**

"I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away, I mustn't—"  
“我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能逃跑，我绝不能——”

"Shut up, please." 请闭嘴。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

Usually those were lines spoken by her, telling him to shut up, that he was being annoying, that this stupid habit of his, that fallback on muttering that same mantra to calm his nerves was just immature, irritating, and, once again, stupid. However, for better or worse, the adult known as Shinji Ikari glanced over at the tense individual sitting next to him, a man he had known for over ten years, through the tough times and the bad, a man who was now in both an enviable situation and a pitiful one: Toji Suzuhara.  
通常这些话都是她对他说的，让他闭嘴，说他烦人，他这个愚蠢的习惯，总是用那句咒语来平复自己的紧张情绪，既幼稚又恼人，而且，又一次，愚蠢。然而，不管是好是坏，成年人真嗣一瞥向坐在他旁边紧张兮兮的那个人，一个他认识超过十年的人，经历了艰难和糟糕的时光，一个现在处于令人羡慕和可怜境地的人：铃原东治。

Years ago, Shinji had watched Toji being ripped apart before his eyes. Well, his Eva being ripped apart, anyway, by Shinji's own Unit-01. That had been almost another life time ago. If you saw Toji know, while you wouldn't think he was in the best of health considering the circumstances, he certainly didn't look like a dismembered devastated wreck. His arms had been replaced with metallic, robotic ones. In the early years following Third Impact, they had looked cartoonish, like something out of a sci-fi film. Just plain metal, unhidden, with long wires and bolts clear to the naked eye. Now, however, thanks to the leaps and bounds of technology, and just the leaps and bounds the world had gone through since Third Impact overall, Toji's mechanical arms, while they occasionally made a buzzing sound every so often due to maybe a loose bolt or a tangled up wire, looked like ordinary appendages, skin, muscle fiber, everything.  
多年前，真嗣曾亲眼目睹了 Toji 被撕裂的场景。确切地说，是他的 Eva 被真嗣自己的初号机撕裂。那仿佛是另一个时代的事了。如今若见到 Toji，尽管考虑到他的经历，你不会认为他身体状况良好，但他绝不像一个肢体残缺、精神崩溃的人。他的双臂已被金属机械臂所替代。在第三次冲击后的最初几年，这些机械臂看起来颇为滑稽，像是科幻电影中的道具，裸露的金属材质，长长的电线和螺栓清晰可见。然而，随着科技的飞速进步，以及第三次冲击后世界整体的巨大变迁，Toji 的机械臂如今已与常人无异，偶尔因松动的螺栓或缠绕的电线发出轻微的嗡鸣声，但其外观已完全模拟了皮肤、肌肉纤维等人体组织。

However, like Shinji said, none of this kept Toji from looking like a broken down wreck right now. Sweat was billowing down his forehead; his hair was in the air because of him ruffling it, tugging at it, anxiously twisting in spite of himself. His eyes were bloodshot, probably because he hadn't had a good night's sleep in the last few days, once again due to circumstance. This lack of sleep also contributed to the black bags he wore under his eyes, the bags that sacked down, and made him look as though he were twenty years older than what he really was: a man at the age of 26.  
然而，正如真嗣所说，这一切都没能让东治看起来不像个支离破碎的废人。汗水正从他的额头滚滚而下；他的头发因为不断抓挠、拉扯，焦虑地扭动而竖立着。他的眼睛布满血丝，很可能是因为他已经好几天没能好好睡上一觉了，这又是环境所迫。这种睡眠不足也导致了他的眼下挂着黑眼圈，那些眼袋下垂，让他看起来仿佛比实际年龄大了二十岁：一个 26 岁的男人。

He looked, for all intents and purposes, like a damn zombie!  
从各方面来看，他简直就像个该死的僵尸！

And Shinji could do nothing about it.  
而真嗣对此无能为力。

"Hey," Shinji mumbled, anxiously wriggling his fingers as he glanced over at Toji, "Do you want me to get you a drink or something? You look like you could use—"  
"嘿，" 真嗣咕哝着，焦虑地扭动着手指，同时瞥向东治，"你要不要我给你拿点喝的？你看起来好像需要——"

"I'm fine, thanks," Toji replied, staring up at the door he had been staring at, waiting in front of, for the last several hours.  
"我没事，谢谢，" 东治回答道，抬头盯着他已经盯着、等待了几个小时的门。

"Are you sure? Listen, she'll be fine, just—"  
"你确定吗？听着，她会没事的，只是——"

"Get yourself a drink. You could use it," Toji replied, glancing over at his friend for a moment.  
“去给自己弄点喝的吧，你正需要这个。” 冬二回答道，目光短暂地瞥向他的朋友。

This was true. In spite of himself, Shinji too looked exhausted. Extremely so.  
这话不假。尽管自己不愿承认，真嗣也显得疲惫不堪。极其疲惫。

Shinji walked down the hospital ward, away from the bench where Toji and their other long time friend Kensuke sat. As he rose, Shinji noticed that Kensuke was actually sound asleep, leaning against the white, cold wall of the hospital hallway. No doubt his job as a military tactician had long hours and lots of stress, so Shinji thought, out of the three of them, HE'D be the one awake, the most calm. But no, he was currently comatose, asleep against the wall, drooling a little bit. His thick brown hair was pressed between his skull and the wall, his usually pasty skin wasn't any more or less pasty than it usually was, his small, slim frame didn't look nearly as exhausted as Toji's large, muscular frame did.  
真嗣沿着医院病房走去，远离了冬二和他们的另一位老朋友健介所坐的长椅。当他起身时，真嗣注意到健介实际上正熟睡着，靠在医院走廊那冰冷的白墙上。毫无疑问，作为军事战术家的工作时长和压力都很大，所以真嗣原以为，在他们三人中，健介会是那个保持清醒、最为镇定的人。但事实并非如此，他此刻正昏昏沉沉地靠在墙上，嘴角还流着口水。他浓密的棕发被压在头骨和墙壁之间，他那通常苍白的皮肤并没有比平时更苍白或更不苍白，他那瘦小的身躯看起来远没有冬二那魁梧的身躯那般疲惫。

"I'll be right back. I just need to use the bathroom a little bit," Shinji replied.  
"我马上回来。只是需要稍微去一下洗手间，" 真嗣回答道。

"Take your time. I'm sure nothing will happen for at least another half-hour," Toji replied, in that tense, strained voice of his.  
"慢慢来。我敢肯定至少还有半小时不会发生什么事，" 东治回答道，声音紧张而勉强。

It bothered Shinji just to see his friend this upset. He'd known him for years, he reflected as he walked down the hallway to whatever destination he intended at arriving at. He'd known him before and after the nightmare known as Third Impact, just like he'd known Kensuke, Hikari, and—  
看到朋友如此心烦意乱，真嗣感到不安。他回想起他们多年的友情，以及在被称为第三次冲击的噩梦前后的点点滴滴，就像他认识剑介、光和——

Where was she, anyway? Where was that German girl? Didn't she realize what her friend was going through right now? What was Shinji saying? Of course she did. She had been the one who had called him last night to tell him to move his ass and arrive at the hospital ASAP. Of course, she had been far harsher with that spitfire tongue of hers, but, in all honesty, Shinji could tell she was worried, concerned, maybe even a little afraid for her friend. This was supposed to be one of the best moments of Toji's life, of Hikari's life, and yet it was proving to be one of the longest, most drawn out periods of stress Shinji had experienced in the last five or six years.  
她到底在哪里？那个德国女孩呢？她难道不知道她朋友现在正经历着什么吗？真嗣在说什么？当然，她肯定知道。昨晚就是她打电话给他，让他赶紧动身，尽快赶到医院。当然，她那火爆的舌头说得更严厉，但说实话，真嗣能感觉到她的担忧，关心，或许还有点为她朋友担心。这本应是剑介一生中最美好的时刻，也是光一生中最美好的时刻，然而现在却成了真嗣过去五六年里经历的最漫长、最紧张的时刻之一。

Nothing next to the pain he felt during that nightmarish day, though.  
尽管如此，没有什么能比得上那个噩梦般的日子里他所感受到的痛苦。

Nothing like the Hell that was Third Impact.  
没有什么能比得上第三次冲击的地狱。

He had to stop reflecting on that day! Third Impact had occurred over a decade ago! It was over, finished! It was a nightmare he was never going to need to relive again, those first three years of utter chaos, the first seven months where he and Asuka remained alone, struggling to survive, wondering if anyone would ever return, the next year seeing civilization struggle to return to normalcy, and, for the rest of the immediate aftermath of Third Impact, watch the nation crumble apart before the remnants of NERV decided to put things in order. The horrors of finding people's starving bodies on the ground in heaps, of seeing people slaughtered in genocide, of being held a prisoner in questioning booths and concentration camps, it was all in the past! All in the damn past!  
他不得不停止回想那一天！第三次冲击已经过去十多年了！一切都结束了，完结了！那是一场他再也不需要重温的噩梦，最初的三年完全混乱，前七个月他和明日香孤立无援，挣扎求生，不知道是否还会有人回来，接下来的一年里，文明努力恢复正常，而在第三次冲击的余波中，眼看着国家分崩离析，直到 NERV 的残余力量决定恢复秩序。那些在街头发现成堆饿死的人们，目睹种族灭绝中的屠杀，被囚禁在审讯亭和集中营里的恐怖经历，都已成为过去！全都他妈的过去了！

Finding himself in front of a sink in the blue-tiled bathroom of this hospital, Shinji threw water against his face, rubbing it clean as he realized the absurdity of what he was saying. All in the past? That was just stupid, as Asuka would always say! He knew that those events had affected him on a deeper level, yes, and that he could never change them. The world he lived in now was drastically affected by those days. All he could do now was hope for a better tomorrow, and, with all that had been going on in the last few years, things had been better.  
发现自己站在医院蓝色瓷砖的洗手间前，真嗣将水泼向脸庞，揉搓着洗净，同时意识到自己所说的话有多荒谬。一切都过去了？那真是愚蠢，就像明日香常说的那样！他知道那些事件在他内心深处留下了影响，是的，他永远无法改变它们。他现在生活的世界深受那些日子的影响。他现在能做的就是期待一个更好的明天，而且，在过去的几年里，事情确实有所好转。

As Shinji left the bathroom, he heard a voice crack as it shouted his name. He glanced over his shoulder, only to see a pair of arms wrap themselves around his face, smothering him in a pair of thick breasts, strangling him, choking the life out of him. He turned blue in a matter of moments, barely able to pull away from that restrictive bear hug only to find, to his utter astonishment, fused of course with utter delight, Misato Katsuragi—er—Misato Hyuga, a woman who had been more a mother to him than even the woman named Yui Ikari, who now was somewhere in the depths of space, perhaps gone forever from Shinji's life.  
当真嗣离开洗手间时，他听到一个声音嘶哑地喊着他的名字。他回头一看，只见一双胳膊紧紧地抱住他的脸，用一对丰满的胸部将他闷住，勒得他喘不过气来。他很快就脸色发青，几乎无法挣脱那个束缚的熊抱，结果却发现，当然也带着无比的惊喜，是美里·卡苏拉吉——呃——美里·日向，这个女人对他来说比名为唯·碇的女人更像母亲，而唯·碇现在可能在太空深处，也许永远离开了真嗣的生活。

Shinji didn't like thinking about that. After all, here was Misato! Don't think about the past, the present! Here! Now! Misato!  
真嗣不喜欢去想那些事。毕竟，眼前是美里啊！别去想过去，别去想现在！就在这里！就在此刻！美里！

Somehow, this didn't cheer him up much at all.  
不知为何，这丝毫没有让他感到振奋。

"Oh, Shinji! I've missed you so—hey, what's wrong?" Misato asked, finally drawing back from her heart-felt, and in Shinji's case boob felt, greeting, only to notice that the recipient of the hug, or perhaps victim would be the better term, wasn't nearly as happy as she was. "Are you stressed about Hikari? Don't be. She'll be fine. It'll all turn out for the best in the end, so don't worry about a thing."  
“哦，真嗣！我好想你——嘿，怎么了？”美里终于从她那发自内心的，对真嗣来说则是胸部感受的问候中退开，这才注意到拥抱的接受者，或许用受害者更恰当，并没有像她那样开心。“你是在担心光吗？别担心。她会没事的。一切最终都会好起来的，所以别担心。”

Shinji, in his flashback, had almost forgotten about the reason he was in this damn, ice cold hospital in the first place. Shaking the cobwebs out of his head, he replied, in a strained voice, "Oh, I'm fine, don't worry."  
在回忆中，真嗣几乎忘记了最初自己为何会在这该死的、冰冷的医院里。他摇摇头驱散思绪，用略显沙哑的声音回答：“哦，我没事，别担心。”

Misato glanced at him critically, and, for the first time in awhile, Shinji had a good look at the woman who had helped raise him before and after—don't think of it, don't think of it, don't think of it! Well, avoiding that thing that would cause him to regress once again into a painful reflection, Misato had aged slightly. Her face had developed slight laugh lines in the ten years past—Damn it! Don't think that way!—that day. Her hair had even developed one or two gray hairs that she seemed to have forgotten, conveniently enough, to dye. Additionally, it looked like her drinking had caught up to her in some degree, as her body now looked slightly puffier than it had last, as though a thin deposit of fat had grown all over her body. Still, to the ordinary person who hadn't known Misato in her heyday, she was quite a knock-out, especially for an older woman.  
美里用审视的目光看了他一眼，而真嗣也难得有机会仔细打量这位在他成长过程中一直照顾他的女性——别想了，别想了，别想了！好吧，避开那个会让他再次陷入痛苦回忆的念头，美里确实有些变化。她的脸上多了几道笑纹，那是过去十年间留下的痕迹——该死！别这么想！那天之后。她的头发里也冒出了一两根白发，她似乎忘了染发。此外，她的饮酒习惯似乎也开始显现影响，身体看起来比上次见面时略显臃肿，仿佛全身都长了一层薄薄的脂肪。不过，对于那些不熟悉美里年轻时风采的普通人来说，她依然是个美人，尤其是对于一位年长的女性而言。

Shinji never thought he'd call Misato an older woman, ever.  
真嗣从未想过自己会称美里为年长的女性。

"You know, Shinji, when you say 'I'm fine' that just screams out how damn upset you really are, but I'll let that one slide," Misato replied, a small grin on her lips, "Look, I know how you must feel. I mean, Makoto went through the same thing with me when I had Yumi." Misato rested a hand absentmindedly on her torso, as though she could still feel the fetus kicking inside of her. "And he went through the same thing with Ryouji." She added, on a gentler note.  
"你知道吗，真嗣，当你说‘我没事’的时候，那简直就是在尖叫你有多么难过，不过这次我就放过你吧，"美里回答道，嘴角带着一丝微笑，"听着，我知道你现在的感受。我是说，诚在优米出生时也经历了同样的事情。"美里不经意地把手放在腹部，仿佛还能感觉到胎儿在里面踢动。"他和谅司也经历了同样的事情。"她补充道，语气更加温柔。

"Uh, where are your children, anyway? Are they with Makoto?"  
"呃，你的孩子们呢？他们和诚在一起吗？"

"Yeah, I mean, he wanted to come, believe me, but someone needed to watch the kids, and he knew I would probably be better emotional support for you guys, so he sent me." Misato added a little laugh at the end, as though to assure Shinji she was fine and happy that she was arriving to this event alone, but Shinji knew differently.  
"是的，我是说，他本来也想来，相信我，但总得有人照顾孩子，而且他知道我可能会是你们更好的情感支持，所以他让我来了。"美里在结尾处加了一点笑声，似乎是为了向真嗣保证她很好，很高兴独自来参加这个活动，但真嗣知道事实并非如此。

Still, he didn't bring it up.  
然而，他并未提及此事。

"So, uh, do you want to come back with us? We're just sitting there, waiting."  
"那么，呃，你想跟我们回去吗？我们只是坐在那里，等着。"

"Okay, that's fine," Misato replied, nodding as the two of them went off to the hospital ward where Toji and Kensuke were. As they walked together, Misato glanced around the hospital, in mild awe, as though the cold interior of this place were something out of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. After a few minutes of glancing around at the occasional hanging picture of a flower or of a random historical figure who had done something special in the field of medicine, she asked, "Is this the hospital that Maya's in charge of?"  
"好的，没关系，" 美里回答道，点头示意两人前往医院病房，那里有真治和健介。他们并肩而行，美里环顾医院四周，带着些许敬畏，仿佛这冰冷的内部环境是出自威利旺卡巧克力工厂的奇景。几分钟后，她不时瞥向偶尔悬挂的花卉画或某位在医学领域有特殊贡献的历史人物肖像，问道："这是玛雅负责的医院吗？"

"Huh? Oh, yeah, she does."  
"嗯？哦，对，她是这样。"

"Oh, that's nice." "哦，那挺好的。"

"Yeah, it is." "是啊，确实不错。"

An awkward silence filled the time period following this statement. For a moment, the two individuals simply walked down the hallway, until Shinji asked, curiously, "Does Makoto have any news on whether—"  
这句话之后，一阵尴尬的沉默弥漫开来。有那么一会儿，两人只是默默地走在走廊上，直到真嗣好奇地问道：“真琴有没有关于是否——的消息？”

"We don't know where Ritsuko is yet," Misato replied, frowning slightly. She glanced over at her side, at the ground by her feet. "And we haven't found—haven't found—"  
“我们还不知道律子在哪里，”美里回答，微微皱眉。她瞥了一眼身旁，目光落在脚边的地面上。“而且我们还没找到——还没找到——”

"Uh, Misato, we're here," Shinji said, gesturing toward Toji as he remained huddled on a bench, with Kensuke slowly rousing himself from slumber land. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Kensuke Aida glanced up, noticing Misato for the first time.  
“呃，美里，我们到了，”真嗣说着，指向仍然蜷缩在长椅上的冬二，以及正慢慢从睡梦中醒来的健介。揉着惺忪的睡眼，相田健介抬起头，第一次注意到美里。

"Misato! Good morning!" Kensuke stammered, rising to his feet and bowing slightly.  
“美里！早上好！” 真嗣结结巴巴地说着，站起身来微微鞠了一躬。

"Kensuke, we're not working right now. You don't need to bow or salute every time I—"  
“真嗣，我们现在不在工作。你不需要每次见到我都鞠躬或敬礼——”

"Just habit, sorry," Kensuke replied, sitting down next to Toji, who now glanced up at Misato, curiously.  
“只是习惯，抱歉，” 真嗣回答道，坐到了冬二旁边，冬二此时好奇地抬头看向美里。

"Oh, hey," he replied in an uncharacteristic tone of bland disinterest.  
"哦，嘿，" 他用一种不寻常的平淡无趣的语气回答道。

"Stressed out, huh?" Misato asked, curiously.  
"压力山大，是吧？" 美里好奇地问道。

"Yeah, I guess you can say that," Toji replied, "Hey, Misato?"  
"嗯，我想你可以这么说，" 冬二回答，"嘿，美里？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"When it happens, you know, does it hurt?"  
"当它发生时，你知道，会痛吗？"

"Oh, uh, well, about that." Misato blushed deep red as she struggled, no doubt, for a delicate, perhaps productive way to tell Toji that the answer to his question was yes, it was excruciating, painful, unbearable, hurt so damn much she'd rather have a battle axe slammed through her torso. "Well, it's not TOO painful. I mean, they put you on medication and anti-pain pills and—"  
"哦，呃，关于那个。" 美里脸红得深红，她挣扎着，毫无疑问，是在寻找一种既委婉又可能有效的方式告诉真治，他的问题的答案是肯定的，那是极其痛苦、难以忍受的，痛得她宁愿被战斧劈穿胸膛。"嗯，不是特别痛。我是说，他们会给你用药和止痛药片之类的——"

The sound of agonized screams filled the air from behind the door.  
门后传来痛苦的尖叫声，空气中弥漫着绝望的气息。

Misato fell silent. 美里沉默了。

"Thanks for at least trying," Toji replied, glumly.  
“至少你尝试过了，”冬二沮丧地回答。

It was at that moment that a doctor departed through those doors, and Toji, the anxious man that he is, jumped up, a tense expression on his face, the expression on his face akin to a sinner seeing God, praying for merciful judgment upon him. He lumbered forward, anxiously, as he spoke, slowly, "Is she—is she—is she alright?"  
"就在那一刻，一位医生从那扇门走了出来，而焦虑不安的冬二立刻跳了起来，脸上带着紧张的表情，那神情宛如一个罪人见到上帝，祈求仁慈的审判降临于他。他蹒跚向前，焦虑地，缓缓地问道：“她——她——她还好吗？””

The doctor, a pleasant looking man probably in his thirties, smiled, and nodded. "Your wife is in pristine condition. The delivery went off splendidly. It's a boy."  
"医生，一个看起来和蔼可亲、大约三十多岁的男子，微笑着点了点头。“您的妻子状况极佳。分娩非常顺利。是个男孩。””

"A boy?" Toji began to giggle to himself, like a giddy school girl, a laugh that grew louder and louder until he fell to his knees, almost in tears as a broad smile spread across his face. Shinji didn't know what to do. He did the thing he supposed was proper for a moment like that: he approached his friend, and patted his back reassuringly. Toji glanced over his shoulder, a smile on his face. "A boy. Can you believe it? a boy."  
"“男孩？”冬二开始自顾自地咯咯笑起来，像个兴奋的小女生，笑声越来越响亮，直到他跪倒在地，几乎要哭出来，脸上绽放出灿烂的笑容。真嗣不知道该做什么。他想在这种时刻应该做的是：他走向朋友，安慰地拍了拍他的背。冬二回头看了一眼，脸上带着笑容。“一个男孩。你能相信吗？一个男孩。””

"I know," Shinji replied, not sure what to say in a time like this. When it had been Makoto, this situation hadn't been nearly as difficult because he had composed himself pretty well, taking everything in stride.  
"我知道，" 真嗣回答道，不确定在这种时候该说些什么。当那是诚的时候，这种情况还没有这么困难，因为他很好地控制了自己，从容应对一切。

"If you want to see your wife, we can let you in, but just be careful: she's exhausted. She's been in labor for quite some time. It's a good thing her friend was with us."  
"如果你想见你的妻子，我们可以让你进去，但请小心：她非常疲惫。她已经分娩了相当长的时间。还好她的朋友和我们在一起。"

"Friend?" Shinji asked, a little confused.  
"朋友？" 真嗣有些困惑地问道。

A second individual existed the double doors to the ward. It was strange: Shinji had asked himself why Asuka was nowhere to be found, but not for a second did he realize, in the event of her friend going through one of the greatest and most painful events in her life, that she'd be in the ward with her friend, helping her own, encouraging her to push, to go on harder, to live. Her long scarlet hair ran down her back, if anything more beautiful than she had been when he first met her. Right now, however, she was just as sweaty as Shinji was, maybe even more so. Her yellow sundress was sticking to her skin, her long crimson hair sticking to her forehead, her baby-blue eyes filled with an exhausted joy, a muted euphoria, a weary happiness.  
另一人从病房的双开门中走了出来。这很奇怪：真嗣曾自问为何找不到明日香，但他从未意识到，在她朋友经历一生中最重大、最痛苦的时刻时，她会在病房里陪伴朋友，帮助她，鼓励她用力、坚持、活下去。她那长长的绯红发丝垂在背后，比初见时更加美丽。然而此刻，她和真嗣一样满身汗水，甚至可能更多。她的黄色太阳裙紧贴着肌肤，长长的深红发丝粘在额头上，那双婴儿蓝的眼睛里充满了疲惫的喜悦，一种沉静的兴奋，一种疲倦的幸福。

"Normally I'd be upset that the Devil was with my wife, but I'll make an exception for today," Toji replied, jumping up and, to Shinji's disbelief, hugging the girl. Shinji thought, at first, that Asuka might be so tired she wouldn't react with that ordinary spitfire tongue of hers, that energy, that bratty streak that hadn't died in the years since her adolescence.  
“通常我会对恶魔和我妻子在一起感到不爽，但今天我破例了，” 阿薰回答道，跳起来，让真嗣难以置信的是，他拥抱了那个女孩。真嗣起初以为，明日香可能太累了，不会像往常那样用她那火爆的舌头回应，那种活力，那种青春期后未曾消逝的顽皮。

She wasn't. 她确实没有。

As Asuka shoved Toji to the floor, she snapped, in a high, strained voice, "Mein Gott! Idiot! Arschloch! Schwein! Ugh!"  
当明日香将真嗣推倒在地时，她用尖锐而紧绷的声音喊道：“我的天啊！白痴！混蛋！猪！呸！”

"What the hell!?" Toji stammered, pushing himself to his feet, stunned, yet frustrated and furious.  
“搞什么鬼！？”真嗣结巴着，挣扎起身，既震惊又沮丧和愤怒。

"Don't hug me! Men are just so stupid!" snapped Asuka, "Hugging people who're just standing there. I did this for Hikari, not you."  
“别抱我！男人就是蠢！”明日香厉声道，“抱那些只是站在那里的人。我这么做是为了光，不是为了你。”

"You just had to ruin a perfectly good moment," Toji stammered, frustrated.  
“你就非得毁了一个完美的好时刻吗？”冬二结结巴巴地说，显得很沮丧。

"Oh, ruin a perfectly good moment? Yeah, right! You think you're stressed out? Imagine how I feel? I had to watch my friend in all that pain! Do you know how much it hurts to give birth? It sucks! You men have no right to just say that you suffered because you had to sit around waiting for us!"  
“哦，毁了一个完美的好时刻？得了吧！你以为你压力大？想象一下我的感受吧？我得看着我的朋友经历那种痛苦！你知道生孩子有多疼吗？太糟糕了！你们男人没资格只因为坐着等我们就说自己受苦了！”

Toji glanced out from the corner of his eyes at Misato, an irate expression on his face. "Nice pain-pills?"  
冬二用眼角瞥了一眼美里，脸上带着恼怒的表情。“止痛药不错？”

"Well, they worked when I was—"  
"嗯，它们在我——"

"Gott in Himmel," sighed Asuka, shaking her head, "If you want to hug someone, hug Hikari. She's in that room, and she sent me out to tell you she wants to see you." Toji glanced down at her, a surprised expression on his face. With a slim smile on her face, she added, "She loves you, you know. A lot. Congratulations." Toji stared at her, still surprised that a demon who had just shoved her to the ground could possibly compliment him immediately after insulting him. Still, the eagerness to see to her wife overrode her curiosity, and he darted past the doctor into the ward.  
"天哪，" 明日香叹了口气，摇着头说，"如果你想抱谁，抱光吧。她在那个房间里，让我出来告诉你她想见你。" 总司低头看着她，脸上露出惊讶的表情。她微微一笑，补充道："她爱你，你知道的。很深。恭喜你。" 总司盯着她，仍然惊讶于一个刚刚把她推倒在地的人居然能在侮辱他之后立刻称赞他。尽管如此，急于见到妻子的渴望压倒了她对这一切的好奇，他匆匆从医生身边跑进了病房。

Asuka sighed, her strong aura of bitchiness deflating as she collapsed on the bench where Toji himself had been sitting. Shinji approached her, surprised to see that Asuka's chest, visible in the sweaty dress, was pulsating dangerously, her heart thumping so hard against her ribs it was visible from a distance. Shinji knew this stress wasn't from Toji hugging her.  
明日香叹了口气，她那股强烈的泼辣气息随着她瘫坐在总司刚才坐过的长椅上而消散。真嗣走近她，惊讶地发现明日香那件汗湿的连衣裙下，胸部剧烈地起伏着，心脏猛烈地撞击着肋骨，从远处都能看得一清二楚。真嗣知道这种紧张不是因为总司拥抱了她。

"Uh, Asuka?" Shinji asked, still too nervous to actually take a seat next to her. What if she lashed out at him?  
“呃，明日香？”真嗣问道，仍然紧张得不敢真正坐到她旁边。万一她对他发火怎么办？

"Hey," Asuka replied, her tone wispy, exhausted, but a small smile spreading up her lips. And exhausted smile, "Sit down, please. You're making me tired just looking at you."  
“嘿，”明日香回答，语气微弱、疲惫，但嘴角还是泛起了一丝微笑。一个疲惫的微笑，“请坐下吧。光是看着你我就累了。”

Feeling braver, he took a seat by the redhead. "How is she?"  
他感觉胆子大了些，便在红发女孩旁边坐下。“她怎么样了？”

"Hikari? She's fine. She's strong, you know? She'll make a great mother, I think. She was considering names for the boy. She thought maybe Shinji would be nice, after you."  
"光？她没事的。她很坚强，你知道的吧？我觉得她会成为一位伟大的母亲。她正在考虑给男孩起名字。她想或许‘真嗣’会不错，以你为名。"

"What? Really?" "什么？真的吗？"

"Yeah, either that or Kensuke. I told her she shouldn't give her child such a terrible name."  
"是啊，要么就是‘健介’。我告诉她不该给孩子起这么糟糕的名字。"

"Hey!" Kensuke stammered, only to realize whom he was speaking to, and recoiled, afraid to be beaten by the devil's tongue.  
"嘿！" 真嗣结巴道，随即意识到自己在和谁说话，便退缩了，生怕被那恶毒的舌头所伤。

"Are you feeling okay, though?" Shinji asked, tentatively placing a hand on her shoulder, concerned for his safety by making physical contact with the German girl.  
"不过，你感觉还好吗？" 真嗣小心翼翼地将手放在她的肩上，担心与这位德国女孩发生身体接触会带来危险。

"Yeah, I'm fine, just tired," Asuka replied, "When we get home, I need to go straight to bed, you know?"  
"嗯，我没事，只是累了，" 明日香回答，"等我们回家后，我得直接上床睡觉，你知道的吧？"

"Oh, okay," Shinji replied, frowning slightly.  
“哦，好吧，”真嗣回答道，微微皱起了眉头。

Asuka scratched the skin behind her ear, brushing aside her hair from her eyes, and, finally, placed a hand on her chest.  
明日香挠了挠耳后的皮肤，将头发从眼前拨开，最后把手放在胸前。

The engagement ring around her finger was clear to see.  
她手指上的订婚戒指清晰可见。

So was that ring's partner on Shinji's finger.  
那枚戒指在真嗣手指上的伴侣亦是如此。

**Part 2 第二部分**

Leaving the bathroom, the young adult known as Shinji Ikari glanced down at the bed partially illuminated by the light filtering behind him. He watched the lovely German in his bed turn over, her scarlet hair twisting underneath her light weight, her flexed fingers pressed against her lips in her slumber, as though she were trying to pull herself into a loose fetal position. She moaned softly in the back of her throat as Shinji approached, sitting down gently beside her to avoid invoking her wrath. To think that, when they were young, Asuka wouldn't have even let him get THAT close.  
离开浴室，被称为碇真嗣的年轻人瞥了一眼那张被身后光线部分照亮的床。他看着床上那位美丽的德国少女翻身，她那鲜红的头发在她轻盈的身躯下缠绕，弯曲的手指紧贴着嘴唇，仿佛在睡梦中试图将自己蜷缩成一个松散的胎儿姿势。随着真嗣的靠近，她喉咙深处发出轻微的呻吟声，真嗣轻轻地坐在她旁边，以免激起她的怒火。回想起来，在他们年幼时，明日香甚至不会让他靠得那么近。

He would've been too terrified to even get NEAR her.  
他本会害怕得连靠近她都不敢。

Terrified? No, not really terrified, but just unwilling to hear her shout and scream like she used to do all the time. Sure, they were just teens in the years before Third Impact, but even so, he wondered if he had loved her even then. When all had gone to Hell as the clock was minutes to midnight, she was the one he went to, who he begged for help, for attention. It was always her, not Misato, not Rei, certainly not his father, her. Of course, then he had done that horrible thing to her, a thing that he felt disgusted by. His psychologists, as following the hell of Third Impact they were all given well-needed psychologists, told him that what he did was just an act after being forced to kill the one person who said he loved him after watching every one of those near and dear to Shinji either lose their minds, die, or emotionally abandon him. He was just desperate, and wasn't in a right state of mind to make proper decisions.  
害怕？不，并非真的害怕，只是不愿再听到她像以前那样大喊大叫。没错，他们在第三次冲击前的那些年都还只是青少年，但即便如此，他不禁怀疑自己当时是否已经爱上了她。当一切陷入地狱，时钟即将敲响午夜的钟声时，他是去找她，向她求助，渴望她的关注。总是她，不是美里，不是丽，更不是他的父亲，是她。当然，后来他做了那件可怕的事，一件让他感到厌恶的事。在第三次冲击的炼狱之后，他们都得到了急需的心理医生，他们告诉他，他所做的一切只是在被迫杀死那个声称爱他的人之后的行为，眼看着身边亲近的人一个个精神崩溃、死去或情感上抛弃他。他只是绝望了，精神状态并不适合做出正确的决定。

That being said, he still hated what he did.  
尽管如此，他仍然憎恨自己所做的一切。

He didn't have the right, no matter how the doctors rationalized, to masturbate over his comatose friends.  
无论医生们如何合理化，他都没有权利对着昏迷的朋友自慰。

He sat down next to the girl, only to tentatively reach out for her, but drew his hand away, despite the band around his finger that he had given to her one-month prior. He glanced at it, in a dazed sort of way, and remembered the preparation it took to actually gather enough courage to go and propose to the German. For someone like Shinji, that was easier said than done. It wasn't like he was completely pathetic, just somewhat pathetic. That's how Shinji saw it, anyway. The fact of the matter was that the German, the Second Child, Asuka, was, for all intents and purposes, a tough girl to understand. Even now, YEARS after they first met, he didn't know much about her. He knew that her mother had died, although he didn't know how, he knew she still didn't care for her stepmother, or to be honest any of her family, all that much, how she still prided herself on her abilities as an Eva Pilot despite not being in the cockpit of the Eva for at least a decade, but most of what he knew of her was from the period of time he had spent with her.  
他坐在女孩旁边，小心翼翼地伸出手去触碰她，却又缩了回来，尽管手指上还戴着一个月前他送给她的戒指。他有些茫然地看了一眼戒指，想起了当初鼓起勇气向那位德国人求婚所做的准备。对于真嗣这样的人来说，说起来容易做起来难。他并不完全可悲，只是有点可悲。至少真嗣自己是这么看的。事实是，那位德国人，二号适格者明日香，从各方面来说都是一个难以理解的女孩。即使现在，在他们初次相遇多年之后，他对她的了解依然不多。他知道她的母亲去世了，虽然不知道原因，他知道她仍然不喜欢她的继母，或者说她对任何家人都不太在意，她仍然以自己作为 EVA 驾驶员的能力为傲，尽管至少十年没有驾驶过 EVA 了，但他对她的了解大多来自与她共度的那段时间。

As he laid down beside her, his mind wandered away, off into a distant time, years ago, until he had returned to that blood-red sea and dead looking beach, with the massive pieces of Rei Ayanami's naked body, pieces that dwarfed skyscrapers, drifting eerily in the water, buoyant somehow despite their mass. The girl known as Asuka Langley Sohryu was currently sleeping on the sand. It had probably been a few weeks since she had returned, for, despite still being in that red plug suit of hers, stained with even darker crimson blood, Shinji had removed the bandages around her arm and the eye patch on her eye. Although surgery had rid the German of any trace of these injuries, back then, they were infected and flaming. Her arm, the arm that had been bisected in her final battle, had somehow healed up down the middle, but not without leaving a great big scar. Her eye, gouged out in that same battle, had partially healed when she returned from the sea of LCL. Although the eyeball itself occupied her eye socket, it was completely blind, and, occasionally, she cried crimson tears. However, what agonized the scarlet haired girl the most was her organs.  
当他躺倒在她的身旁，思绪飘散，穿越时空，回到多年前，回到那片血红的海与死寂的沙滩，巨大的绫波零裸体残骸，其体积超越摩天大楼，诡异地漂浮在水中，尽管质量巨大却不知为何能浮起。被称为惣流·明日香·兰格雷的女孩此刻正躺在沙滩上沉睡。她归来可能已有数周，因为尽管仍穿着那件沾满更深暗红血迹的红色插入栓服，真嗣已将她手臂上的绷带和眼上的眼罩取下。虽然手术已让这位德国少女身上再无这些伤痕的痕迹，但那时，它们感染严重，如火焚身。她那在最终战斗中被斩断的手臂，不知怎的从中线愈合，却留下一道巨大的疤痕。那只在那场战斗中被挖出的眼睛，从 LCL 之海归来时已部分愈合。虽然眼球占据了眼窝，却完全失明，偶尔还会流出鲜红的泪水。然而，最令这位红发少女痛苦的是她的内脏。

In the battle with the Mass Production Evas, Asuka's Evangelion had been disemboweled. Due to the great level of synchronization with her Eva, her organs too had been skewered inside of her body. At least that's how Asuka had explained it after she had recovered from the shock of dying and returning to life in this Hell. Shinji wasn't sure just how much damage Asuka had retained in her returning to life, and he was not knowledgeable when it came to the human anatomy.  
在与量产型 EVA 的战斗中，明日香的 EVA 被开膛破肚。由于与她的 EVA 高度同步，她的内脏也被刺穿在体内。至少明日香在从死亡和重生于这个地狱的震惊中恢复后是这样解释的。真嗣不确定明日香重生后还保留了多少伤害，他对人体解剖学也不甚了解。

All he knew was that, when she cried out in pain and began gagging on her own blood, he was afraid.  
他所知道的是，当她痛苦地呼喊并开始咳血时，他感到害怕。

Shinji had weaved a makeshift blanket together using reeds he had found on the side of the beach. It was sloppy, ill-made, but it was enough to keep one warm in the cold nights on that beach, waiting for someone else to return. Crabs and other sea animals had returned, so surely living humans were next. He had glanced over at Asuka, who was tossing and turning on the sandy beach. He had approached her, and, tentatively, laid the blanket over her, the stiff reeds splintering as he attempted to tuck the blanket around her, hoping it would keep her warm.  
真嗣用他在海滩边找到的芦苇编织了一条临时毯子。虽然做得粗糙，但足以在海滩上寒冷的夜晚保暖，等待其他人归来。螃蟹和其他海洋生物已经回来了，所以活人应该也快了。他瞥了一眼在沙滩上辗转反侧的明日香。他走近她，试探性地把毯子盖在她身上，试图用僵硬的芦苇将毯子围在她周围，希望这能让她保持温暖。

He needed her. 他需要她。

He needed someone. 他需要某个人。

Before he could finish covering her cold svelte body with the reeds, however, her eyes snapped open. She pushed herself up, ripping the reed blanket to pieces. Shinji had watched as all that hard work, all that time and effort putting together some sort of protection from the cold environment, turn out to be all for naught. Shinji didn't even see Asuka vomit a profuse amount of blood as she gasped for air, crying to herself as she squeezed her side. He only noticed her plight when she fell to the ground, twitching slightly on the floor.  
然而，在他用芦苇覆盖她冰冷纤细的身体之前，她的眼睛突然睁开了。她猛地坐起身，将芦苇毯撕成碎片。真嗣眼睁睁看着自己辛苦编织的、为了抵御寒冷环境的保护措施化为乌有。他甚至没注意到明日香在喘息中吐出大量鲜血，一边哭泣一边紧按着侧腹。直到她倒在地上，微微抽搐时，他才注意到她的困境。

"Asuka!" he had shouted, darting to her side, reaching out for her.  
"明日香！" 他大喊着，疾步冲到她身边，伸出手想要触碰她。

He slapped his hand away.  
他猛地拍开了他的手。

"Don't touch me," Asuka whispered in her weak voice, between gasps of air, "Don't get near me. Don't look at me. I don't want to see your disgusting face ever again."  
"别碰我，" 明日香用微弱的声音低语，每说一句都伴随着急促的呼吸，"别靠近我。别看我。我再也不想看到你那张令人作呕的脸。

Shinji could only stare in shock. All he wanted to do was help her. That was it. It couldn't be a sin to want to help the only other human being alive with him, right? Surely she didn't have to be this cruel, this harsh, to him. All he wanted to do was help. That was it. Just help out a little bit, and she was hurting him. "But I—"  
"真嗣只能震惊地盯着她。他只想帮助她，仅此而已。想要帮助唯一与他共存的另一个人类，这怎么可能是罪呢？她肯定不必对他如此残忍，如此严厉。他只想帮忙，仅此而已。只是想帮一点忙，而她却在伤害他。“但我——””

"Don't speak!" Asuka shrieked, only to vomit out blood once more.  
“别说话！”明日香尖叫道，随即再次吐出鲜血。

"You're—" Shinji was interrupted when Asuka slammed her backhand across his face. He fell against the sandy floor, his face red, his lip bleeding slightly.  
“你——”真嗣话未说完，就被明日香一记反手扇在脸上。他跌倒在沙地上，脸颊通红，嘴唇微微出血。

"This is all your fault," Asuka mumbled, barely able to speak as she quivered in pain, clutching herself as she tried to steady herself, "All your fault. You let them kill me. You let them kill mama. And all you did was just sit there on your ass and listen to them rip me to shreds! You didn't do anything! You could have helped, stopped them from eating me or disemboweling me or stabbing me, but oh no! You chose to come out once I was in shreds! You bastard! You let mama die!"  
"这都是你的错，" 明日香喃喃自语，痛苦得几乎无法言语，她颤抖着，紧紧抱住自己试图稳定下来，"都是你的错。你让他们杀了我。你让他们杀了妈妈。而你只是坐在那里，听着他们把我撕成碎片！你什么都没做！你本可以帮忙，阻止他们吃掉我或开膛破肚或刺伤我，但是哦不！你选择等我被撕成碎片后才出现！你这个混蛋！你让妈妈死了！"

"Mama?" To this day, Shinji had no idea what she was talking about. He assumed she was a little hysterical, maybe even a tad confused, following her death. He wouldn't know. Unlike her, he had never died.  
"妈妈？" 直到今天，真嗣仍不明白她在说什么。他猜想她可能有点歇斯底里，甚至有些混乱，毕竟她刚经历过死亡。他无从得知。与她不同，他从未死过。

Asuka fell to her knees, holding herself weakly as she whispered, softly, "Mama, I'm ready. Please, let's die together. Please. Just this once. Please? I'm ready now, mama."  
明日香跪倒在地，虚弱地抱着自己，轻声细语，"妈妈，我准备好了。请，让我们一起死吧。请。就这一次。好吗？我现在准备好了，妈妈。"

"What's wrong?" “怎么了？”

Shinji woke up, sweating profusely, as he turned to see Asuka, a confused expression on her face, in his bed, not vomiting blood, not hitting him violently, not begging to die with her mother, but just there, staring at him, an eyebrow raised. "Huh? What do you mean by that?" Shinji finally managed to say, knowing full well he must have been tossing and turning in bed.  
真嗣醒来，满头大汗，转身看到明日香在他床上，脸上带着困惑的表情，没有吐血，没有暴力地打他，没有哭喊着要和母亲一起死，只是在那里，盯着他，眉毛一挑。“嗯？你什么意思？”真嗣终于开口说道，他很清楚自己肯定在床上辗转反侧。

"You were fidgeting around. You looked upset, like, really upset. I mean, were you having another flashback or something?"  
“你在床上动来动去的。看起来很不安，真的非常不安。我是说，你是不是又在做噩梦了？”

"Yeah, I guess," Shinji confessed.  
"是啊，我想是吧，" 真嗣坦白道。

"You guess, huh? That just figures. Getting all nostalgic on us once Hikari has a baby. Typical." She sighed, resting a hand on her breasts as she asked, calmly, "So what was it this time?"  
"你只是猜猜，嗯？这很正常。一旦光有了孩子，就开始对我们怀旧。典型的。" 她叹了口气，一手放在胸前，平静地问道，"这次又是什么？"

"I don't remember—" "我不记得了——"

"C'mon! You know you're not going to feel any better unless you talk about it, and besides, what kind of an answer is you don't remember anyway!? That's like freaking telling someone that you heard a really big secret and you said, 'Oh! I can't tell you! It's a secret!' You don't just start talking about something only to stop talking about it five seconds later! It's a freakin' tease!"  
"来吧！你知道不谈出来你不会感觉好些的，再说了，‘我不记得了’这种回答算什么嘛！这就像你听到了一个大秘密，然后说，‘哦！我不能告诉你！这是秘密！’你不能只开了个头，五秒钟后就闭嘴不谈了！这简直是耍人嘛！"

Resigning, he said, simply, "The beach."  
他无奈地叹了口气，简单地说：“海边。”

"Oh, that." Her face deflated somewhat. "That was years ago, and you know it."  
"哦，那个啊。" 她的表情有些泄气。"那是好几年前的事了，你也知道。"

"I know, but still, you were so—"  
"我知道，但还是，你当时那么——"

"You know, these blankets sure are heavy," Asuka interrupted, pulling herself out of bed, "It's getting hot in there."  
"你知道吗，这些毯子确实很重，" 明日香打断道，从床上爬起来，"里面越来越热了。"

"What do you mean? The blankets are perfectly fine," Shinji replied, confused.  
"你什么意思？毯子明明很好啊，" 真嗣回答，感到困惑。"

"Oh, I guess I won't take them off, then," Asuka replied, simply, as she removed her shirt.  
"哦，那我就不脱了。" 明日香简单地回答，同时脱下了她的衬衫。

"What're you doing!?" Shinji stammered, staring at her incredulously.  
"你在干什么！？" 真嗣结结巴巴地说，难以置信地盯着她。

"I'm taking my clothes off, what does it look like?" she replied, simply.  
"我在脱衣服，你看不出来吗？" 她简单地回答。

"Yeah, I can see that, but why!?"  
"是啊，我能理解，但为什么！？"

"Well, if you won't let me take off the blanket, how else do you expect me to cool down?" she asked, simply.  
""好吧，如果你不让我掀开毯子，那你还指望我怎么降温呢？"" 她简单地问道。

"Well—" "嗯——"

"What? Afraid to sleep with a woman without any clothing on?" she teased, in a mocking tone.  
"什么？怕和一个没穿衣服的女人睡觉吗？" 她用嘲弄的语气逗弄道。

Feeling a minor sensation of déjà vu, Shinji replied, indignantly, "No! I'm not afraid! Go ahead and strip! See what I care!"  
感到一丝似曾相识的感觉，真嗣愤愤不平地回答："不！我不怕！尽管脱吧！看我会在乎吗！"

"Okay," she replied, in a surprisingly pleased tone. She ripped the remainder of her clothing off, revealing her naked form, save for her bra and panties. Shinji noticed the long thin scar that ran up her torso. When doctors and hospitals began to return, they had operated on her. It wound up that numerous organs had been damaged. It was a miracle she had survived for weeks on the beach like that. They told her that she must have someone high up looking after her.  
"好吧，" 她以出乎意料的愉快语气回答。她撕掉了剩下的衣服，除了胸罩和内裤外，全身赤裸。真嗣注意到她躯干上那条细长的疤痕。当医生和医院开始恢复运作时，他们为她做了手术。结果发现她的多个器官受损。她能在海滩上存活数周简直是个奇迹。他们告诉她，一定是有位高层在守护着她。

She said it was her mama.  
她说那是她妈妈。

"Okay, now don't think anything dirty or I'll kill you," Asuka replied as she curled up next to Shinji, pressing her cheek to his bosom.  
"好了，现在别想什么乱七八糟的，不然我杀了你，" 明日香一边回答，一边蜷缩在真嗣旁边，将脸颊贴在他的胸膛上。

"Uh—" With that statement, Shinji's eyes focused on his fiancé's cleavage. He couldn't help it! You couldn't just say "Don't think dirty thoughts" and NOT attract a man's attention to those key locations. He hated himself for it, but he couldn't help it. She didn't help situations, either, when she began to glare at him through narrowed eyes, her nails digging into his chest, with a look that clearly expressed her utmost desire to strangle him.  
"呃——" 听到这话，真嗣的目光不由自主地落在了未婚妻的胸前。他控制不住自己！你不能说“别想歪念头”却不引起男人对那些关键部位的注意。他为此感到厌恶自己，但他就是控制不住。她也没让情况好转，当她开始眯起眼睛瞪着他，指甲掐进他的胸口，那眼神明显表达了她最强烈的愿望——掐死他。

"You're thinking something dirty, aren't you?"  
"你在想什么不正经的事，对吧？"

"Sorry?" Shinji replied, inching away slowly from Asuka. He watched as his fiancé's fist rose into the air, through the blankets, as he lightly punched his shoulder.  
"什么？" 真嗣回答道，慢慢地从明日香身边挪开。他看着未婚妻的拳头穿过毯子，轻轻地打在他的肩膀上。

"I'll kill you in the morning, okay?"  
"我明天早上就杀了你，好吗？"

"Alright?" "还好吗？"

"Hey, Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"I'm freezing! Taking off my clothes was not a bright idea. Can I get a little closer?"  
"我快冻僵了！脱掉衣服真不是个好主意。我能靠得近一点吗？"

"Uh, okay." "呃，好吧。"

"Thanks." The German moved closer, inching closer and closer until he could feel her breasts press against his chest, her soft torso pressed up against his, her firm legs wrapped around his, her arms curled around his chest. He always knew that Asuka was about as tall as he was, but to have her up against him like this just proved to him that either he was a small guy or she was a pretty tall woman. After a few moments, she murmured, "Your breath is tickling me."  
"谢谢。" 德国人挪得更近了，一点点靠近，直到他能感觉到她的胸部紧贴着他的胸膛，柔软的身躯紧贴着他，结实的双腿环绕着他，双臂环抱着他的胸膛。他一直知道明日香和他差不多高，但像这样紧贴着他，只是证明了他要么是个小个子，要么她是个相当高的女人。过了一会儿，她低声说："你的呼吸在逗弄我。"

Shinji knew he had experienced this once before. This sounded so oddly familiar, but he just couldn't place the—wait a second! Asuka had said all of this sort of stuff before their first kiss together! She had used some sort of excuse to find themselves into a situation to reach her designated goal, in that case kissing him, goaded him into going her way by calling him afraid, and had even said how Shinji's breath tickled her. The only question is why would do something like that right now? What did she have to gain by stripping almost completely naked in bed with Shinji almost immediately after Hikari had a baby, which could only be created by having—  
真嗣知道他以前经历过这种情况。这听起来如此熟悉，但他就是想不起来——等等！明日香在他们第一次接吻之前说过类似的话！她用某种借口让自己陷入一种情境，以达到她的预定目标，在那次是吻他，用他害怕来激他，甚至还说过真嗣的呼吸逗弄她。唯一的问题是，她现在为什么要这么做？在光莉刚生完孩子之后，她几乎全裸地和真嗣躺在床上，这只能是通过——

Oh.

**Part 3 第三部分**

"Hey! Get back here! Stop crying!"  
嘿！回来！别哭了！

"You know, it's strange seeing you as a mom, Hikari."  
"你知道吗，看到你当妈妈的样子真奇怪，光。"

"You really think so?" "你真的这么觉得？"

It was a shock to see her freckled, brown haired friend as anything other than the class representative she had first met in middle school, a girl who took charge of her classes with her loud, occasionally militaristic orders. Still, Hikari Suzuhara, as Asuka still had to remember was now her full name, looked almost a little comical after a few weeks of being a mom. She was clinging to her little boy, whom Hikari called Shinji, but Asuka called Shin-chan, who was putting up quite a fit. They had changed his diaper, but it looked like he was more interested in something else, specifically the fluid contents of Hikari's plumped breasts.  
看到她这位有着雀斑、棕色头发的朋友，不再是中学时初次见到的那个班级代表，那个以响亮、偶尔带有军事化口吻发号施令的女孩，确实让人震惊。不过，尽管须原光现在已经是她的全名，须原光，但当了几个星期的妈妈后，她看起来几乎有点滑稽。她紧紧抱着她的小男孩，光称他为真嗣，而明日香则叫他真酱，小家伙正在闹脾气。他们刚给他换了尿布，但他似乎对别的东西更感兴趣，特别是光那丰满乳房中的乳汁。

Asuka had to admit that, for a woman who had only given birth a couple weeks ago, she sure had adjusted well to the new situations related to motherhood. Sure, she hadn't lost all the baby fat that she had accumulated while bringing her bouncing rugrat into the world, but she had lost a good deal of it, enough to the point where she looked much like her old self again. With a smile on her face, she pressed her child's lips against her exposed breast, and breastfed him. It was only after a few seconds that she realized that Asuka was in the room with her, watching this somewhat personal moment. Blushing, she said, "Sorry about this."  
"明日香不得不承认，对于一个仅仅几周前才分娩的女人来说，她确实很好地适应了与母亲身份相关的新情况。当然，她还没有完全减掉怀孕期间积累的婴儿肥，但她已经减掉了不少，足以让她看起来又像过去的自己了。她面带微笑，将孩子的嘴唇贴在她裸露的乳房上，开始哺乳。几秒钟后，她才意识到明日香在房间里，正看着这个略显私密的时刻。她脸红了，说道：“抱歉让你看到这个。””

"Hey, don't worry about it. It's natural," she shrugged, "Nothin' awkward about feeding your baby."  
"“嘿，别在意。这是很自然的，”她耸耸肩，“喂宝宝没什么尴尬的。””

"Thanks. Where's Shinji?"  
"“谢谢。真嗣去哪儿了？””

"He's sucking on your—" "他在吸你的——"

"Not that one!" "不是那个！"

"Oh! You mean the idiot! Well, he's at work right now," Asuka replied, scratching her cheek absentmindedly. The idiot. The words seemed to ring off her tongue, almost in an affectionate sort of way, as though she were beating him with a smile on her face. It was strange. Sure, she could be abusive, but he never did leave her, did he? He never did abandon her. Sure, in the past they had their struggles, but now, everything had balanced itself out just about right, hadn't it?  
"哦！你是说那个笨蛋！嗯，他现在在工作，" 明日香回答道，心不在焉地挠了挠脸颊。笨蛋。这个词似乎从她嘴里蹦出来，带着一种近乎宠溺的意味，仿佛她是在笑着揍他。这很奇怪。当然，她可能会很刻薄，但他从未离开过她，不是吗？他从未抛弃过她。没错，过去他们有过争执，但现在，一切都恰到好处地平衡了，不是吗？

"You really like him, don't you?" Hikari replied, smiling.  
"你真的很喜欢他，对吧？" 光笑着回答。

"He's just an idiot," Asuka restated.  
"他就是个白痴，" 明日香重申道。

"Yeah, but he cooks, helps clean around the house while you just laze there eating potato chips," Hikari pointed out.  
"是啊，但他会做饭，还会帮忙打扫家里，而你只是懒洋洋地躺在那里吃薯片，" 光指出。

"Blunt today, are we?" "今天这么迟钝，是吧？"

Hikari giggled again, blushing deep red. "Sorry."  
光再次咯咯笑起来，脸红得深。“对不起。”

"Don't worry about it. Hey, where's that other stooge, Toji?" Asuka hadn't seen him once since she set foot in the Suzuhara residence. It was strange. It wasn't uncommon for Toji to spend time with Shinji while she was here, but at least she saw him. Now it was as though he had been a ghost that had recently been exorcised.  
"别担心。嘿，那个跟班户次去哪儿了？" 明日香自从踏进铃原家就没见过他一次。这很奇怪。户次和真嗣一起度过时间并不罕见，但至少她能看到他。现在他好像是个刚被驱走的鬼魂。

"Well, he's out getting stuff for the baby, or at least that's what he said the moment he heard you were coming," Hikari replied.  
"嗯，他出去给宝宝买东西了，或者至少他是这么说的，就在听说你要来的时候，"光回答道。

"Dummkopf," Asuka murmured, resentfully. That idiot just took off an ran just because of her arrival? What an asshole! He was all fun and games with Shinji, but the moment Shinji's soon-to-be wife arrived, he had to get out of there! Figures. What an asshole. Sure, she wasn't always the sweetest person to him, but still, did he have to prove to her that he was an asshole?  
"笨蛋，"明日香不满地嘟囔着。那个白痴就因为她的到来而跑掉了？真是个混蛋！他和真嗣玩得挺开心的，但真嗣的未婚妻一出现，他就得溜之大吉！真是的。真是个混蛋。没错，她对他并不总是那么友善，但他有必要向她证明自己是个混蛋吗？

"Well, in all fairness, you do have a tendency to yell at him," Hikari said.  
"好吧，公平地说，你确实有对他大吼大叫的倾向，"光说。

"Well, yeah, but that's only when he's being a complete and utter moron."  
"嗯，是的，但那只是当他完全彻底像个白痴的时候。"

"But it's half of the time you're with us?"  
"但那几乎是你和我们在一起的一半时间？"

"Er ist ein Idiot!" Asuka replied, bluntly.  
"他就是个白痴！" 明日香直截了当地回答道。

"Come again?" “再说一遍？”

"He's an idiot!" she replied, a laugh on her tongue, but, midway through her giggle, she clasped her hand on her mouth as she struggled to hold back a sudden wave of nausea, a wave that had hit her without warning, without any previous signs, without any sort of ANYTHING preceding it. She darted to the bathroom, where she knelt down by the toilet seat as she threw it open, lowering her mouth to the open water, waiting for vomit to spill from her mouth.  
“他是个傻瓜！”她笑着回答，但笑声中段，她突然用手捂住嘴，努力抑制住一阵突如其来的恶心感，这感觉毫无预警，没有任何先兆，没有任何前兆。她冲进浴室，跪在马桶前，打开盖子，将头靠近水面，等待着呕吐物的涌出。

Thankfully, after waiting for a few minutes, the sudden urge to vomit faded away, but the nausea hadn't.  
幸运的是，几分钟后，突如其来的呕吐冲动消退了，但恶心感并未消失。

"Hey! Are you alright?" Hikari asked, darting into the room after placing her baby safely into his crib.  
"嘿！你还好吗？" 光问道，将宝宝安全地放进婴儿床后快步走进房间。

"Yeah, just felt a little sick all of a sudden," she replied, holding a hand on her lower belly as she rose to her feet.  
"嗯，只是突然感觉有点不舒服，" 她回答，一手按在腹部下方，缓缓站起身来。

"Are you sick?" "你生病了吗？"

"A little, I think. I'm not sure. This has been happening for the last few days, since last Monday, so I guess I'm just having a stomach virus or something like that, you know? It's nothing to be too worried about. Just a little bit of medicine and—"  
"我觉得有点儿。我不确定。这种情况已经持续了几天，从上周一开始，所以我猜我只是得了胃病毒之类的，你知道吗？没什么好太担心的。吃点药就好了——"

"Uh, are you sure about that?" Hikari asked.  
"呃，你确定吗？" 光问道。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"You don't get sick too often," Hikari replied.  
"你不太常生病，" 光回答道。

"Yeah, so this is just one of those infrequent times I'm actually feeling under the—"  
"是啊，所以这只是那些不常见的时刻之一，我其实感觉不太舒服——"

"When was the last time you had your period?"  
"你上次来月经是什么时候？"

"Well—wait a second! Just what're you implying by that!?" snapped Asuka, staring dumbfounded at her friend, her eyes wavering in their sockets.  
"哎——等等！你这话是什么意思！？" 明日香厉声说道，目瞪口呆地盯着她的朋友，眼珠在眼眶里摇摆不定。

"Well, you might be pregnant for all we know," Hikari replied, "I mean, I felt really nauseous, and if you've been feeling nauseous since last Monday, and today's Sunday, that means you've been feeling this way for a week!"  
"嗯，我们也不知道你是不是怀孕了，" 光子回答道，"我是说，我当时感觉非常恶心，如果你从上周一就开始感到恶心，而今天是周日，那就意味着你已经这样持续一周了！"

"So?"

"That's a little more than a few days," Hikari replied, "Look, maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions, but have you and Shinji, er, well, have you—" Asuka's face, which had turned a darker shade of red than the hair on her head, answered Hikari's question for her. "You know, I have a pregnancy test think left over from when I was pregnant. I should probably get that right now."  
"那可不止几天了，" 光子回答道，"听着，也许我只是有点草率下结论，但你和真嗣，呃，嗯，你们有没有——" 明日香的脸，已经红得比她的头发还要深，替她回答了光子的问题。"你知道，我怀孕时还剩了一个验孕棒。我现在应该去拿那个。"

"I'm not pregnant! I'd know if I was pregnant!"  
"我没有怀孕！如果怀孕了我会知道的！"

Shinji was sitting behind his desk, staring up at the ceiling as he always did during these slow days. The fact that he was a former pilot of the Evangelion seemed to be enough reason for him to be given a job at NERV, but the fact that he had been assigned as one of the heads of the newly instated NERV seemed a little extreme. He wasn't a soldier, didn't know anything about the new society, which had focused itself on militaristic defense and the aid of nations throughout the world who were recovering after the horrors of Third Impact. His job essentially meant working out peace treaties between nations NERV seemed to like, proposing to his superiors to veto other peace treaties in order to eliminate cruel and abusive governments, and, of course, searching for souls returning from the sea of LCL, which had shrunk in the years following Third Impact. It had shrunk from a massive planet-sized ocean to a sea located near the Tigris and Eurphrates Rivers, where, according to the numerous religious cults that had sprang up following the horrors of Instrumentality, that the Abrahamic Bible designated that the Garden of Eden existed.  
真嗣坐在办公桌后，像往常一样盯着天花板发呆。他曾是 EVA 驾驶员，这似乎足以让他获得在 NERV 工作的资格，但被任命为新成立的 NERV 高层之一，似乎有些过头了。他不是军人，对新社会一无所知，这个社会已经转向军事防御，并帮助世界各地从第三次冲击的恐怖中恢复过来的国家。他的工作基本上是协调 NERV 喜欢的国家之间的和平条约，向他的上级提议否决其他和平条约以消除残酷和虐待的政府，当然，还要寻找从 LCL 之海归来的灵魂，这个海在第三次冲击后的几年里已经缩小了。它从覆盖整个行星的巨大海洋缩小到位于底格里斯河和幼发拉底河附近的一个海，根据第三次冲击后涌现的众多宗教团体所说，那里是圣经中指定的伊甸园所在地。

Garden of Eden? What a joke.  
伊甸园？真是笑话。

The phone at his desk rang. As he answered it, he expected to hear his superiors on the other line. "Hello, this is Shinji Ikari speaking." He expected some order, some new job for him to handle. However, he DIDN'T expect a high pitched female voice to shout at him from the top of her lungs, a voice so loud that she had to draw the phone at least an arm's length away from his ear to actually hear properly.  
他桌上的电话响了。他接起电话，以为会听到上级的声音。“你好，我是碇真嗣。”他以为会接到什么命令，有什么新任务要处理。然而，他万万没想到会是一个尖锐的女性声音从电话那头尖叫出来，声音大到他不得不把电话至少拿开一臂之遥才能听清楚。

"You stupid idiot! How could you?! You stupid, stupid, jerk! You disgusting pervert, I should've never trusted you for a second! Schwein! Dummkopf! Bastard! Seducer! Schmutz der Erde!"  
“你这个大笨蛋！你怎么能这样？！你这个蠢货，蠢货，混蛋！你这个恶心的变态，我真不该相信你哪怕一秒钟！猪！傻瓜！混账！诱骗者！地球上的污垢！”

"Wait, just hold on a second Asuka—!"  
"等等，先别急，明日香——！"

"Don't you just tell me to hold on a second, you stupid idiot!"  
"别跟我说什么等一下，你这个大笨蛋！"

"Just what're you yelling about?"  
"你到底在嚷嚷什么？"

"Oh! Don't act like you don't know you idiot!"  
"哦！别装作你不知道，你这个白痴！"

"I don't know! You just started yelling at me and—" Shinji was interrupted when the door opened. In walked the elderly Commander Fuyutsuki, a man who had miraculously managed to keep his job, no, be promoted to head of NERV following the controversy NERV received following Third Impact.  
""我不知道！你突然对我大吼大叫，然后——"" 真嗣的话被开门声打断了。走进来的是年迈的指挥官冬月，一个在第三次冲击引发的争议后奇迹般保住职位，甚至被提拔为 NERV 负责人的男人。

"Ikari-san, we have—" "碇君，我们有——"

"Don't you just play stupid and act like the innocent little oaf everyone thinks you are! Schwein!"  
"别装傻充愣，表现得像大家以为的那个无辜小傻瓜一样！猪头！"

"On second thought, I'll leave you two alone." Fuyutsuki backed out of the room, closed the door over, and, if Shinji's ears didn't deceive him, sprinted as far away from the room as possible.  
"再一想，我还是让你们俩单独待着吧。" 冬月退出了房间，关上门，而且，如果真嗣的耳朵没听错的话，他飞快地跑得离房间越远越好。

Why did he have to leave him alone with this insanity?  
为什么他非得把他一个人留在这疯狂之中？

"But what's going on? I don't understand what's happening."  
"但这是怎么回事？我不明白发生了什么。"

On the other side of the line, Shinji could hear a second voice speak. He barely made out, "Asuka, let me speak to him for a second. You're being hysterical!" only to have the rest of Hikari Suzuhara's interruption blocked out by more of his fiancé's shouting.  
电话那头，真嗣能听到另一个声音说话。他勉强听出，"明日香，让我跟他说几句。你太激动了！"但随后铃原光希的打断被他未婚妻更多的喊叫声淹没了。

"You made me—you made me—"  
"你让我——你让我——"

"Made you what?" "让你什么？"

"Pregnant!" "怀孕了！"

Shinji stared at the phone for a moment or two, confused. Pregnant? Oh, wasn't that supposed to be a joyous event, filled with smiling and laughter, with a deeper connection of love and passion, without shouting and screaming? Why did everything have to be painful? "Uh, congratulations?"  
真嗣盯着手机愣了一会儿，感到困惑。怀孕？哦，那不应该是充满欢笑和喜悦，伴随着更深层次的爱与激情，而不是争吵和尖叫吗？为什么一切都如此痛苦？“呃，恭喜？”

"Don't you 'congratulations' me, you jerk! You made me pregnant! You seducing little—"  
"别跟我说'恭喜'，你这个混蛋！你让我怀孕了！你这个勾引人的小——"

"Seducing? I didn't seduce you!"  
"勾引？我可没勾引你！"

"Well, what about a few weeks ago when you essentially raped me in your bed? Hmmm?"  
"那几周前，你在床上几乎强奸了我，这又怎么说？嗯？"

"Raped you? What the hell are you talking about? You went into the bed with no clothing on and we made love!"  
"强奸你？你到底在说什么鬼话？你一丝不挂地上了床，我们明明是做爱了！"

"Oh, don't use that old blame me routine of yours! You need to accept responsibility for your actions, you jerk!"  
"哦，别再用你那老一套的怪罪我的伎俩了！你得为自己的行为负责，你这个混蛋！"

"How about you accept responsibilities for once? You went into a bed wearing nothing!"  
"你怎么不承担一次责任？你可是赤裸裸地上了床！"

"I was too wearing something!"  
"我确实穿了什么！"

"You were wearing panties and a bra, and were using the same tactics you used when we were kids when you made me kiss you! What was I supposed to think!?"  
"你只穿了内裤和胸罩，还用了我们小时候你让我亲你时的那套战术！我还能怎么想！？"

"Oh, don't use that old excuse on me again!"  
"哦，别再用那个老借口糊弄我了！"

"When was the last time I ever made that excuse before, anyway?"  
"话说回来，我上次用这个借口是什么时候了？"

"Oh! Don't change the subject!"  
"哦！别转移话题！"

"I didn't!" "我没有！"

"Oh, you stupid—Hey! Hikari! What're you—?"  
"哦，你这个笨蛋——嘿！光！你在——？"

The other end of the line began to ruffle and tremble. Shinji drew the phone closer to his ear, sure to hear Hikari's voice as opposed to Asuka's high pitched shrill. Thankfully, his expectations were fulfilled. "Hey, listen, don't mind her, she's just a little upset right now. She'll cool off once she adjusts to everything."  
电话那头开始沙沙作响，颤抖起来。真嗣将手机贴近耳朵，希望能听到光的温柔声音，而不是明日香那尖锐的嗓音。幸运的是，他的期望得到了满足。“嘿，听着，别在意她，她只是现在有点不高兴。等她适应了一切，就会冷静下来的。”

"Uh, okay." Cool off? He hoped that happened soon. If Asuka was upset with him, chances are he wouldn't even be let into the house, left outside of a barricaded door in the dark. The weatherman forecasted thunderstorms, too. "Listen, uh, how did you guys find out she was pregnant, exactly?"  
"呃，好吧。"冷静下来？他希望这能尽快发生。如果明日香对他生气了，很可能他连家门都进不去，只能被关在门外，在黑暗中面对紧闭的大门。天气预报还说会有雷暴。“听着，呃，你们是怎么知道她怀孕的，确切地说？”

"A pregnancy test." "一支验孕棒。"

"Oh, uh, how accurate is it?"  
"哦，呃，它的准确度如何？"

"Pretty accurate." "相当准确。"

"I see. Uh, thanks, Hikari."  
"我明白了。呃，谢谢，光。"

"Don't mention it." "不用谢。"

"I'm going to hang up now—"  
"我现在要挂电话了——"

"Dummkopf! Don't you dare hang up on me you idiot!" Shinji pulled the phone away from his ear in shock, staring at it, his eyes wide with fear, as though the wires would come alive to strangle him.  
"笨蛋！你敢挂我电话，你这个白痴！" 真嗣震惊地将电话从耳边拉开，盯着它，眼中满是恐惧，仿佛电线会活过来勒死他。

"I'm at work! I can't keep talking on the phone! I have to hang up now!"  
"我在上班！不能一直讲电话！我现在得挂了！"

"I hope they fire you, you son of a—" Shinji slammed the receiver down, exhaling slowly as he leaned back in his chair, staring up at the ceiling once more.  
"我希望他们炒了你，你个混蛋——" 真嗣猛地挂上听筒，缓缓呼气，靠回椅背，再次抬头望向天花板。

Pregnant? 怀孕了？

A child? 一个孩子？

Asuka? 明日香？

Father. 父亲。

**Part 4 第四部分**

"If you will do it, do it now! Otherwise, leave!"  
“如果你要做，现在就做！不然就别做！”

"I have a use for you."  
"我有你的用处。"

"Leave!" "离开！"

The voice of the ghost from his past haunted his mind, enveloped his concentration as he drove home. The thought of his fiancé being pregnant and the no doubt violent rage that awaited him at home was in the back of his head. No, the young adult known as Shinji Ikari was focused on a man from the past, a man who he had not seen for the past decade, a man who still haunted him after all this time. A man with a long chinstrap beard, glasses, white gloves, and a cold, calculating glare that would leave you shivering in your boots.  
来自过去的幽灵的声音萦绕在他的脑海中，笼罩着他的专注力，当他开车回家时。未婚妻怀孕的想法以及家中无疑等待着他的暴力愤怒在他脑海中挥之不去。不，被称为碇真嗣的年轻人正专注于一个来自过去的人，一个他十年来未曾见过的人，一个即使过了这么久仍然困扰着他的人。一个留着长长的下巴胡须、戴着眼镜、白色手套，以及一双冷酷、算计的眼神，足以让你在靴子里打颤的人。

"Father." “父亲。”

The father who abandoned him, who left him miserable and desperate in the world, alone, only to be a miserable wreck from childhood to adolescence. The horrors of Third Impact and the world that followed it had left him horror struck for the years after it, but every so often Shinji would remember the bastard of a father he had, unloving and uncaring. The only person he had ever met who had a kind thing to say about that man was Shinji Ikari's superior, the current Commander of NERV itself: Fuyutsuki.  
那个抛弃了他的父亲，让他在这个世界上孤独、绝望，从童年到青春期都只是一个悲惨的废人。第三次冲击及其后的世界留下的恐怖，让他多年后仍心有余悸，但时不时地，真嗣会想起他那个无情无爱的父亲。唯一一个对那个男人有好话的人，是真嗣·碇的上司，NERV 现任指挥官：冬月。

Shinji remembered when NERV had first been recommissioned by the World Government. Fuyutsuki, who had offered an explanation of the whole ordeal of Third Impact, was allowed to lead the organization, especially considering how Fuyutsuki decided to lend his effort reconstructing the Japanese government during the horrors of the early post-Third Impact world. Fuyutsuki was quick to hire all the old members of NERV, including the Eva pilots. Maya had been put in charge of the science department, Hyuga had become one of the head tacticians, Aoba was head of Weapon Development and the unofficial musician for the NERV Christmas parties, Misato was promoted to sub-commander, both he and Asuka were given high ranking jobs. Their schedules, thankfully, rarely clashed, so if they did have a child, they'd be able to raise—  
真嗣记得 NERV 最初被世界政府重新启用的时候。冬月副司令曾对整个第三次冲击事件做出了解释，因此被允许领导组织，尤其是在第三次冲击后初期世界的恐怖中，他决定贡献力量重建日本政府。冬月迅速招募了 NERV 的所有老成员，包括 EVA 驾驶员们。玛雅被任命为科学部门负责人，日向成为了首席战术师之一，青叶担任武器开发部门主管兼 NERV 圣诞派对的非官方音乐家，美里晋升为副指挥官，他和明日香也都获得了高阶职位。幸运的是，他们的日程很少冲突，所以如果他们有了孩子，也能够共同抚养——

Father. 父亲。

That set Shinji back on track. He remembered when Fuyutsuki had first hired him. Shinji had refused, or at least was hesitant. This was his father's company, not his. He didn't want to be reminded of that man, that bastard, anymore than he had to. It was then that Fuyutsuki had said, wearily, "You know, your father would've wanted me to give you this high paying job, you know? One day you'll know this."  
这使真嗣重新回到了正轨。他记得当初冬月第一次雇用他时的情景。真嗣拒绝了，或者说至少是犹豫不决。这是他父亲的公司，不是他的。他不想再被那个男人，那个混蛋，提醒任何关于他的事情。就在那时，冬月疲惫地说道：“你知道吗，你父亲会希望我给你这份高薪工作的，你知道吗？总有一天你会明白的。”

The man who left him alone as a child for years, only called him when he needed him, and left him an emotional train wreck would have wanted him to work in a corporation that had been labeled, in the modern media, "The Modern Illuminati" and "The Founders of Third Impact"?  
那个在他童年时将他独自留下多年，只在需要时才打电话给他，让他成为一个情感上的灾难的人，会希望他在一家被现代媒体称为“现代光明会”和“第三次冲击的创始人”的公司工作吗？

Yeah, that sounded like something he'd do.  
是啊，这听起来像是他会做的事情。

Apparently Fuyutsuki cared so deeply about his father that he had erected a statue in his honor outside the NERV entrance. After all, nowadays NERV was a public organization, no longer a secret Government society. Because it was public, people walked by the statue of Gendo Ikari standing majestically every day, and, every day, someone would throw rotten fruit against its bust. While Fuyutsuki would sometimes personally clean the statue to ensure it was in pristine condition, Shinji actually wished that, one day, he could throw a giant watermelon against his father's face so that it would splatter against his nose line, covering his face in red as he shouted all the things he couldn't say a decade ago.  
显然，冬月对父亲的深情厚意体现在他在 NERV 入口处为父亲竖立了一座雕像。毕竟，如今 NERV 已是一家公开机构，不再是秘密的政府社团。正因为公开，人们每天都会经过那尊庄严矗立的碇源堂雕像，而每天总有人向那雕像的胸像投掷腐烂的水果。尽管冬月有时会亲自清理雕像，确保其完好无损，但真嗣其实希望有一天能朝他父亲的脸扔一个巨大的西瓜，让它在鼻梁上炸开，满脸通红地喊出十年前无法说出口的一切。

None of those unsaid words were all too polite.  
那些未曾说出口的话，可都不怎么客气。

Still, when Shinji's son—er, child—was born, he's make sure he—or she—never had to suffer that horrible fate of having a father ignore him, of abandoning him—or her—entirely. Still, raising his child the way he wanted to raise him would mean Shinji returning home to face his violent, ill-tempered fiancé. She sounded so angry over the phone, so entirely furious. What was he going to do? She wasn't the type to exactly forgive and forget quickly. Years ago, Asuka was a more violent individual, especially following Third Impact.  
尽管如此，当真嗣的儿子——呃，孩子——出生时，他会确保他——或她——永远不会遭受那种可怕的命运，即被父亲忽视，被完全抛弃。然而，按照他想要的方式抚养孩子，意味着真嗣必须回家面对他那暴躁易怒的未婚妻。她在电话里听起来如此愤怒，完全怒不可遏。他该怎么办？她可不是那种轻易原谅和忘记的人。多年前，在第三次冲击之后，明日香变得更加暴力。

He pulled over at a supermarket, looking for some sort of way to stall, to escape needing to return home to face the horror of his German haired lover—no, good friend—no, acquaintance—no, mortal enemy. Anxiously, he withdrew his mp3 player, and escaped into the gentle music it supplied. His old SDAT player, even at the time he used it constantly antiquated, had vanished during the horror of Third Impact. He had sought to get a replacement, but, as it were, had never really came around to purchasing one. However, the mp3 player he used now was a gift from Asuka.

It had been a birthday present, his twenty first birthday. It had been a little more than a year or two since the world had fully recovered from the Hell of Third Impact. Most people often give others, on their twenty first birthday, something to signify the newfound privileges gained with their age. Toji, for example, bought him a pornographic DVD, much to both Hikari and Asuka's distaste. Kensuke, on the other hand, bought him a guidebook to the best bars in Tokyo-3. Misato had given him an expensive bottle of sake. Asuka would later joke that they were lucky that the bottle wasn't half empty by the time Shinji received it. Shinji expected things to allure him to the benefits of being an adult, but the gift that seemed to impact Shinji most was a gift that reminded him of the past.  
那是一件生日礼物，他二十一岁的生日礼物。自第三次冲击的炼狱后，世界全面复苏已过去了一两年。大多数人会在二十一岁生日时，送些象征新获特权的东西。比如，真治送了他一张色情 DVD，让美里和明日香都颇为反感。剑介则送了他一本东京-3 最佳酒吧指南。美里给了他一瓶昂贵的清酒。明日香后来开玩笑说，幸好瓶子在真嗣收到时还没空了一半。真嗣本以为会收到些吸引他享受成人生活的好处，但对他影响最深的礼物，却是唤起过往回忆的那一份。

"It's not like I needed to put that much thought into it," Asuka had rationalized after Shinji opened the present, turning the case over and over to see the present from every possible angle, "I just remember how you liked listening to that old tape player of yours all the time when we were younger. I mean, I knew that you wanted to have a tape player or whatever it was you had, but this is better. It has 100 gigabytes of memory, so you can fit a bunch of songs on it, and play some games like Solitaire on it. Also, it comes with a dozen songs on it, and you can play videos on it. So yeah, no big deal."  
"我又不是需要花那么多心思去想这个，" 在真嗣打开礼物后，明日香这样辩解道，她不停地翻转着盒子，从各个可能的角度观察这份礼物，"我只是记得你小时候总是喜欢听你那个旧磁带播放器。我是说，我知道你想要一个磁带播放器或者你原来有的那种东西，但这个更好。它有 100GB 的内存，你可以放很多歌曲进去，还可以在上面玩像纸牌这样的游戏。而且，它自带了十几首歌，你还可以在上面播放视频。所以，没什么大不了的。"

"How much did this cost?" Shinji had asked, worried that his friend had spent too much on someone like him.  
"这东西花了多少钱？" 真嗣问道，担心他的朋友为他这样的人花了太多钱。

"Why the hell does that matter?" Asuka snapped, "Look, you're actually caring about stuff like that? C'mon! Seriously! It's a damn gift! Never mind what it costs!"  
"这他妈有什么关系？" 明日香厉声说道，"听着，你居然在乎这种事？拜托！说真的！这是份该死的礼物！别管它值多少钱！"

Shinji could only stare at her in awe. Even though she had a confident grin on her lips, he knew that, deep down, she had been afraid that Shinji didn't like her present. That, below that harsh exterior, she had asked herself, day after day, would he like it? Would he accept it? "Thank you, Asuka!"  
真嗣只能敬畏地盯着她。尽管她嘴角挂着自信的微笑，但他知道，在她内心深处，她一直担心真嗣不喜欢她的礼物。在那坚硬的外表下，她日复一日地问自己，他会喜欢吗？他会接受吗？“谢谢你，明日香！”

"Hey, seriously, don't mention it."  
“嘿，真的，不用谢。”

As he focused again on the reality before him as he picked up a package of miso, Shinji Ikari focused on a separate memory. He recalled a day after following the nightmare that was Third Impact. It had been a month after Asuka returned that either of them dared to leave the sanctuary of the beach. Why it had taken so long Shinji didn't know. He guessed that, after witnessing the world die before them, they really didn't feel like adventuring the depths of oblivion. Perhaps it was because the sea of LCL had provided for them so well, with crabs and sea creatures right there for eating and the LCL sea there for nutritious life fluids. Additionally, in Asuka's condition, she couldn't move all that far without her organs bleeding within her.  
当他再次专注于眼前的现实，拿起一包味噌时，真嗣·碇专注于另一段记忆。他回忆起在第三次冲击那场噩梦之后的一天。那是明日香回来一个月后，他们才敢离开海滩这个避难所。为什么花了这么长时间，真嗣不知道。他猜想，在目睹世界在他们眼前消亡之后，他们真的不想冒险深入那片虚无。也许是因为 LCL 海洋为他们提供了如此好的生存条件，螃蟹和海洋生物就在那里供他们食用，LCL 海洋则提供了营养丰富的生命之液。此外，以明日香当时的状况，她无法走得太远，否则她的内脏会在体内出血。

Shinji had been constructing a wheelbarrow of sorts to carry the German. He had constructed it from driftwood that had miraculously came to them from the sea about two weeks after Shinji had found Asuka beside him. Having nothing else to do, he whittled the log until it had depth, enough to cradle a human body. The wheel, thankfully, had washed up on shore not long after he found the wood. It was something you'd find on a big wheel bicycle a toddler would use. It wasn't the best sort of barrow, but in this sort of situation, it was the best he had.  
真嗣一直在制作一种独轮车，用来搬运那位德国人。他用的是漂流木，这些木头奇迹般地从海上漂来，大约在真嗣发现明日香躺在他身边的两周后。无所事事之下，他耐心地将木头削成有足够深度的凹槽，足以容纳一个人的身体。幸运的是，车轮不久后也被冲上了岸，看起来像是幼儿使用的大轮自行车上的那种。这不是最好的独轮车，但在这种情况下，这是他能做的最好的了。

"I won't go in that," Asuka had said the moment she saw Shinji's creation, her voice dead and exhausted.  
“我不会坐那个的，”明日香一看到真嗣的作品就立刻说道，声音死气沉沉，疲惫不堪。

"Listen, we're going to have to see if anyone else is here," Shinji had said, surprised by his own sense of bravery. After baring witness to Instrumentality, he had learned to face reality head on. The only way their situation was going to change for the better was if they faced the world head on. Shinji had been surprised that Asuka, who was always so gung-ho and always looking for a solution. She was never this passive, or perhaps hesitant to do anything, before. "You're too injured to walk. The only way we're going to survive is if you get on and I wheel you around."  
"听着，我们得看看这里还有没有其他人，" 真嗣说道，对自己突如其来的勇气感到惊讶。经历了人类补完计划后，他学会了直面现实。只有勇敢面对世界，他们的处境才有可能好转。真嗣对明日香感到意外，她总是那么积极主动，总是寻找解决问题的方法。她以前从未如此被动，或者说犹豫不决。"你伤得太重，走不了路。我们想要活下去，唯一的办法就是你坐上来，我推着你走。"

"I don't care if I die," Asuka replied, in an almost dead voice, "Just leave me alone. I'd rather die than be with you."  
"我不在乎我会不会死，" 明日香几乎用一种死寂的声音回答，"就让我一个人待着吧。我宁愿死也不要和你在一起。"

"Listen! Please! Snap out of it!" Shinji had shouted as he had heaved the German to her feet, hoping she'd stand on her own two feet.  
"听着！求你了！振作起来！" 真嗣喊道，他用力将德国女孩扶起，希望她能自己站起来。

She hadn't. 她没有。

Shinji had caught her before she had hit the floor. With a small grin on her lips, Asuka had asked, in a cold, strangely amused tone, "You mean you don't want me to die?"  
真嗣在她撞到地板前接住了她。阿斯卡嘴角挂着一丝微笑，用一种冰冷而奇怪的语气问道：“你是说，你不想让我死？”

"Why would I want you to die?" Shinji had stammered, now desperate, his eyes starting to tear.  
“我为什么要你死？”真嗣结结巴巴地说，现在他急了，眼睛开始泛泪。

"Why else would you leave me alone to die like that? Why else would you just jerk off on top of me, huh? Why else would you start strangling me the moment I came back to life? I don't want this. I just want to be left alone here, and die. Just let me shrivel up and die."  
"不然你为何要留我一人孤独赴死？为何要在我身上发泄兽欲，嗯？为何我一复活你就立刻掐住我的脖子？我不想要这些。我只想在这里独自死去。就让我枯萎，让我死去。"

"Please don't talk like that."  
"请不要这样说。"

"Why? It makes our poor little bastard Shinji the Hero get all upset? Do you want to cry, huh? Well, face reality: it's your fault I'm like this, why the world's like this! It's all your fault!" She had begun screaming as she slowly pushed herself into a standing position. However, as she continued to shout obscenities at the Third Child, she began to vomit on herself. Torrents of blood exploded from her mouth, dying the sand scarlet. She trembled, falling onto her back, clutching her belly. Tears filled her eyes, tears of pain, tears of fury and anger, tears that shone in the pale moonlight.  
"为什么？难道这会让我们的可怜小混蛋真嗣英雄感到难过吗？你想哭吗，嗯？好吧，面对现实吧：这都是你的错，我变成这样，世界变成这样！都是你的错！"她开始尖叫，同时慢慢站起身来。然而，当她继续对第三适格者破口大骂时，她开始呕吐，鲜血从口中喷涌而出，将沙地染成猩红色。她颤抖着，倒在地上，紧抱着腹部。泪水充满了她的眼眶，那是痛苦的泪水，愤怒的泪水，在苍白的月光下闪烁着。

He was sure, then and there, that she was going to die.  
那一刻，他确信她即将死去。

"Please, don't die! Don't die! I need you. I need you. I can't just live without someone, so please don't leave me alone!" He had fallen to his knees, tears running down his fourteen year old cheeks as he stared down at the broken girl as she coughed again and again, more droplets of ruby splattering against her lips and cheeks.  
“求求你，不要死！不要死！我需要你。我需要你。我不能没有某个人而活，所以请不要留下我一个人！”他跪倒在地，泪水顺着他十四岁的脸颊滑落，他凝视着那个受伤的女孩，她一次又一次地咳嗽，更多的鲜红血滴溅在她的唇边和脸颊上。

"Well, isn't this what you wanted? Me like this? Dummkopf!" she had grunted between coughs, "I hope you like it. I hate you so God d—" Shinji scooped her into his arms. She was surprisingly light, much lighter than he had anticipated, as he dumped her gently into the wheelbarrow. "What're you doing? I told you I'm not—hyakk!" She coughed loudly onto her lap, a large wad of blood splattering against her thighs.  
“这不就是你想要的吗？我变成这样？笨蛋！”她在咳嗽间喘息着，“希望你喜欢。我恨你，该死——”真嗣将她抱入怀中。她出乎意料地轻，比他预想的要轻得多，他轻轻地将她放入手推车里。“你在干什么？我告诉过你我不——咳咳！”她大声咳嗽，一大滩血溅在她的腿上。

Shinji remembered praying that a doctor or surgeon had returned from the sea of LCL, just so that Asuka wouldn't have to die in a make-shift wheelbarrow in the middle of nowhere like this. She didn't deserve to suffer like that, didn't deserve to die such a sad, pathetic death like this.  
真嗣记得自己曾祈祷过有一位医生或外科医生从 LCL 之海归来，只为让明日香不必在这样的荒郊野外，躺在临时拼凑的轮床上死去。她不该遭受这样的痛苦，不该就这样悲惨、可怜地死去。

She didn't deserve to suffer after all she had been through.  
她经历了那么多，实在不该再受苦了。

Shinji Ikari was pulled out of his flashback as the sound of his phone ringing filled the air. He hastily reached into his pocket, and withdrew his cell. "Hello?" he asked, not looking at the caller ID in his haste.  
碇真嗣被手机铃声从回忆中拉回现实。他匆忙伸手进兜里，掏出手机。“喂？”他问道，急切间没顾上看来电显示。

"Shinji! I just heard the good news!"  
"真嗣！我刚听到好消息！"

"Misato?" "美里？"

A cheerful giggle met his ears from the other side of the phone line, a giggle that reminded him of all the times he had spent living at her house when he and Asuka were only fourteen and thirteen years old, respectfully. It reminded him, strangely enough, of a young girl, despite Shinji having, in memory, associated Misato as the closest thing to a mother he ever had. "Well, Asuka called me and told me the whole story. Or at least told me her side of it."  
电话那头传来一阵欢快的笑声，让他想起了那些住在她家时的时光，那时他和明日香分别是十四岁和十三岁。这笑声让他奇怪地想起了一个小女孩，尽管在记忆中，美里是他最接近母亲的存在。“嗯，明日香给我打电话，把整个故事都告诉我了。至少是她那一边的版本。”

"Oh, did she?" "哦，是吗？"

"Yeah, complete with calling you a few creative curse words that my kids have been repeating for the past ten minutes."  
"是啊，还用一些富有创意的脏话骂了你，我孩子们过去十分钟一直在重复这些话。"

"Do you believe her?" "你相信她吗？"

"What kind of a question is that? Of course I don't! I know you too well for that. I'm just surprised you actually managed to, uh, go to home base."  
"这是什么问题？当然没有！我对你太了解了。我只是惊讶你居然真的能，呃，去到本垒。"

"Come again?" “再说一遍？”

"I can't say it with the kids around. Uh, hey!" Misato's voice faded away slightly, as though she were holding the phone a good deal away from her face and talking to her children. "Yumi, take your brother over into the other room, alright? Don't ask why! I'm having an adult conversati—no, you aren't grown up enough to know what it is. Thanks, sweetie." Her voice returned to its ordinary volume. "No, I mean, I never expected you to have sex."  
"有孩子在旁边我不好说。呃，嘿！" 美里声音稍微减弱，仿佛她把电话拿得离脸很远，正对着孩子们说话。"由美，带你弟弟去另一个房间，好吗？别问为什么！我正在和一个成年人交谈——不，你还不够大，不知道这是什么。谢谢，宝贝。" 她的声音恢复了平常的音量。"不，我是说，我从没想过你会发生性关系。"

"Wait, what?!" "等等，什么？！"

"I thought you'd just remain a virgin for the rest of your—"  
"我以为你会一直保持处子之身直到——"

"Misato. Stop now." "美里。现在停下来。"

"Alright, I'm just joking!"  
"好吧，我只是开个玩笑！"

"I hope you were." "我希望你是。"

"But still, what're you going to name the baby?"  
"不过，你打算给孩子起什么名字？"

Shinji considered this. "I haven't really discussed it with Asuka. Actually, I haven't discussed anything with her yet."  
真嗣思考了一下。 "我还没和明日香讨论过。实际上，我还没和她讨论过任何事情。"

"Oh, did she kick you out of the house?"  
"哦，她把你赶出家门了？"

"I haven't even gotten home yet. I'm a little afraid to."  
"我还没到家呢。有点害怕回去。"

"Well, you can't run away from this forever, you know. Best get the worst over with. She'll calm down soon, so don't worry."  
"唉，你总不能一直逃避这个问题。最好尽快面对最糟糕的情况。她很快就会冷静下来的，别担心。"

"Are you sure about that?"  
"你确定吗？"

"Oh, absolutely positive! Asuka isn't the type to keep a grudge."  
"哦，绝对肯定！明日香不是那种记仇的人。"

"Are you sure about that?" Shinji asked, seriously.  
"你确定吗？" 真嗣认真地问道。

"Well, uh…" Misato's voice trailed off, leaving Shinji with the distinct impression she was struggling to buy time. "Oh crap! Ryouji! Stop hitting your sister! I got to go! See ya! Good luck with the preggy!" With that, the line died. Shinji personally doubted that she had any sort of problem with her kids at that moment. For a woman who told him not to run away, she sure was running away when he needed her. What a reliable adult she was.  
"嗯，呃…" 美里的话音渐渐消失，让真嗣明显感觉到她在努力拖延时间。"哦糟了！良治！别打你妹妹！我得挂了！再见！祝你怀孕顺利！" 说完，电话就断了。真嗣个人怀疑她此刻并没有什么孩子的问题。这个告诉他不要逃避的女人，在他需要她的时候却逃得飞快。真是个可靠的大人啊。

After paying for his food, Shinji continued into his car, and drove back home to face the music, to face his destiny. His mp3 player was still playing in his ears as he rode back home, despite a perfectly good car radio and stereo system. All he could think about was that redhead. He tried to remember the last time she was truly furious at him, the last time she had been this angry. When they were younger, they had argued constantly, but, as time went on, these arguments seemed to dwindle. That's not saying they didn't happen frequently, though. For example, just a few months ago they had found themselves arguing about something trivial, something regarding food.  
付完餐费后，真嗣继续坐进车里，驱车回家面对现实，面对他的命运。他的 mp3 播放器仍在耳边播放着音乐，尽管车里有一套完好的车载收音机和音响系统。他满脑子都是那个红发女孩。他试图回忆她上次真正对他发怒是什么时候，上次她这么生气是什么时候。他们年轻时经常争吵，但随着时间的推移，这些争吵似乎逐渐减少。但这并不意味着它们不常发生。比如，就在几个月前，他们还因为一些琐事，关于食物的事情争吵过。

"You know I like my burgers with a little red in them," Asuka had snapped, staring down at the deep brown meet with a disgusted expression.  
"你知道我喜欢汉堡带点血丝的，" 明日香厉声说道，盯着那深褐色的肉，脸上露出厌恶的表情。

"It's healthier when it's thoroughly cooked," Shinji had replied.  
"彻底煮熟了更健康，" 真嗣回答道。

"Yeah, but it's also all dried up! Do you want me eating a dried up burger like this?" she had replied, her tone harsh.  
"是啊，但那样就全干了！你难道想让我吃这种干巴巴的汉堡吗？" 她回敬道，语气尖锐。

"Just put ketchup on it and it won't be dry. Problem sol—"  
"只要加点番茄酱就不干了。问题解决——"

"Doesn't change the fact that the middle is still all brown!" Asuka had interrupted, violently, "I mean, seriously, I think the burgers at McDonalds are better!"  
"中间还是一片棕色的事实并没有改变！" 明日香激烈地打断道，"我是说，认真点，我觉得麦当劳的汉堡都比这个好！"

"Well, you could just order from there. Their burgers are thoroughly brown too, I think."  
"那你完全可以点那家的。我觉得他们的汉堡也是完全棕色的。"

"Yeah, but it's also not really meat! It's some meat substitute they have with a lot of filler in it! And besides, it makes you fat."  
"是啊，但这也不算是真正的肉！这是他们用很多填充物做的肉替代品！而且，它会让你发胖。"

"You seem to eat it enough on your way to work," Shinji replied.  
"你上班路上似乎吃得够多了，" 真嗣回答道。"

At that moment, the German had jumped to her feet, crushing her burger underneath her fist as she slammed her knuckles down against the table. "Are you implying something!?"  
就在那一刻，那位德国人猛地站起身来，拳头下的汉堡被压得粉碎，她用指关节重重地敲击着桌子。"你在暗示什么吗！？"

"Implying what?" "暗示什么？"

"Dummkopf! You think I'm a damn porker, don't you!?" she had snapped, her face scarlet.  
""笨蛋！你以为我是头该死的肥猪，对吧！？"" 她厉声说道，脸涨得通红。

"Who ever said that?" Shinji had laughed in disbelief. Fat? Asuka was a stick. Her breasts probably contained more fat than the rest of her body combined, sure, but otherwise she was stick. Slender, svelte. When they were younger, there were even times Shinji wondered if she was too thin. In any case, the sheer idea that Shinji could even think, for a second, that she was fat was downright absurd!  
""谁说的？"" 真嗣难以置信地笑了起来。胖？明日香瘦得像根棍子。她的胸部可能比身体的其他部分加起来还要多脂肪，当然，但除此之外她就是根棍子。苗条，纤细。在他们还小的时候，真嗣甚至有几次怀疑她是不是太瘦了。无论如何，真嗣竟然会有一瞬间认为她胖，这想法简直荒谬至极！

"Don't you laugh at me! I—" A moment had passed where Asuka considered all that she had just said. More blush ran up her cheeks as she muttered, in a soft tone, "I'm doing it again, aren't I?"  
"别笑话我！我——" 阿斯卡停顿了一会儿，思索着她刚刚所说的一切。她的脸颊上泛起了更多的红晕，她轻声嘀咕道，"我又在这样了，对吧？"

"Doing what?" "在做什么？"

The redhead had lowered herself into her seat, running a hand up her hair. "I'm just blowing things out of proportion like I always do. Say it. I know I'm right."  
红发女孩坐回了自己的座位，用手梳理着头发。"我只是像往常一样夸大其词。说吧，我知道我是对的。"

"Well, yeah, you are," Shinji replied.  
"嗯，是的，你是，" 真嗣回答道。

She had sighed again at this, holding her head in both hands. "I'm just a wreck, aren't I? I'm never going to change. I'll still be just as much of a bitch as I was when I was a kid."  
她再次叹了口气，双手抱头。"我只是个废物，对吧？我永远不会改变。我还是会像小时候那样是个婊子。"

"Huh? What're you talking about?" Shinji had asked, confused.  
"啊？你在说什么？" 真嗣困惑地问。

"Do you know what I heard some people saying at work? They were talking about me behind my back! I heard them, you know. They were chatting away about that German girl who has trouble reading Kanji or that German bitch who was a pilot or that German bitch who thinks she's so hot."  
"你知道我在工作中听到一些人在说什么吗？他们在背后议论我！我听到了，你知道的。他们在闲聊那个德语女孩汉字读不好，或者那个德国婊子是个飞行员，还是那个德国婊子自以为很了不起。"

"Who's been saying that?" Shinji had asked, critically.  
"谁在说这些？" 真嗣追问道，语气中带着质疑。

"A bunch of the girls who work there."  
"就是那里的几个女同事。"

"Do you know any of them."  
"你认识他们中的任何一个吗？"

"I don't know," she had replied, rising to her feet, "I shouldn't let it bother me, though. I'm better than that. I've grown up. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not—"  
"我不知道，" 她回答道，站起身来，"不过我不应该让它困扰我。我比那更好。我已经长大了。我不是个孩子。我不是个孩子。我不是个孩子。我不是个孩子。我不是——"

"You know, if someone hurts you, it's not immature not to feel a little insulted," Shinji had said, frowning, "In fact, I think it's kinda natural to feel something."  
"你知道，如果有人伤害了你，感到有点受辱并不是不成熟，" 真嗣皱着眉说，"事实上，我觉得有点感觉是很自然的。"

"But I don't like it," Asuka had replied, frowning as well, "I mean, why me?"  
“但我并不喜欢这样，”明日香也皱着眉头回答，“我是说，为什么是我？”

Why me indeed. As Shinji approached the door to his apartment complex, his bags in hand and his spirits tentative, he paused a moment to remove his mp3 player, ready to face reality. As he drew nearer to the door, he mumbled under his breath the mantra that he had recited over and over again throughout the course of his life: "I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away." He recited it again and again as he rang the doorbell with his elbow, unable to reach the button with his hands, laden with bags.  
为什么是我，确实。当真嗣走近他的公寓楼大门时，手里提着行李，心情忐忑不安，他停了一会儿，取下他的 mp3 播放器，准备面对现实。当他走近门口时，他低声念叨着一生中反复背诵的咒语：“我不能逃跑。我不能逃跑。我不能逃跑。”他一遍又一遍地重复着，用肘部按响了门铃，因为双手提着行李，无法用手指触碰按钮。

The door slid open to reveal the German girl. Just laying eyes on Asuka sent a jolt through Shinji's body. There she was, ready to beat him to a pulp, ready to shout and scream at him, ready to call him an idiot and remind him that it was his fault, not Asuka the girl who crawled into his be naked, that she had a baby growing inside of her. He flinched at first, instinctively, upon laying eyes on her flaming red hair. A second or two past before Shinji lowered his arms, only to meet his fiancé's eyes. They were puffy, but not tear laden. It was as though she had cried hours before, and the residual effects had yet to wear off. Cautiously, Shinji murmured, "I'm home," before walking anxiously past his fiancé into the kitchen. As he dropped the bags onto the kitchen table, he heard the door slide shut behind him. This was it. Asuka was going to pummel him now. She was going to shout now that the door was closed and the world couldn't see her ugly side.  
门滑开了，露出那个德国女孩。仅仅看到明日香就让真嗣的身体一阵颤抖。她就在那里，准备把他揍得鼻青脸肿，准备对他大喊大叫，准备骂他是个白痴并提醒他，是她怀了孩子，而不是那个赤裸着爬进他床上的明日香。他一开始本能地退缩了一下，看到她那火红的头发时。一两秒钟过去，真嗣才放下手臂，与他的未婚妻对视。她的眼睛肿胀，但没有泪光。仿佛她几小时前哭过，而残留的影响还未消退。小心翼翼地，真嗣低声说：“我回来了。”然后紧张地从未婚妻身边走过，进入厨房。当他把袋子放在厨房桌上时，听到身后的门滑上了。就是这样。明日香现在要揍他了。她要关门后大喊大叫，让世界看不到她的丑陋一面。

"Asuka, I'm sor—" “明日香，我很抱歉——”

"Don't apologize," Asuka replied, "Don't worry about it. I should be the one saying sorry."  
“别道歉，”明日香回答，“别担心。我才是该说对不起的那个人。”

"Huh?" This was a tad different than what he had been expecting. He had thought at least one piece of furnature would be overturned, a few shouting matches, and at least fifty verbal punches matched with fifty real ones. He didn't expect her to just admit defeat so easily. He watched as Asuka fell into a couch, her hands resting on her torso. She glanced up at Shinji, a frown o her lips.  
"啊？" 这和他预想的情况有些出入。他本以为至少会有家具被掀翻，几次争吵，以及至少五十句言语攻击配上五十次实际的冲突。他没想到她会这么轻易地承认失败。他看着明日香跌坐在沙发上，双手放在腹部。她抬头看向真嗣，嘴角带着一丝不悦。

"I'm sorry. I said it, alright? Isn't that good enough?"  
"对不起。我说了，行了吧？这样还不够吗？"

"What do you—" "你这是——"

"You didn't do anything wrong, I should've been taking the pill, all that stuff, alright?" Asuka said, her tone mildly frustrated, "Jesus! How many times do I have to say this again?" Her voice cracked mildly toward the end, but her resolve was strong. Her eyes were growing slightly more moist as the seconds past, but her heart didn't waver. She stared at Shinji with a deep resolve, as though she were hoping, praying, that her eyes relayed the message deep inside of her: she was sorry. She was wrong.  
"你没做错什么，我本该吃药的，所有那些事，对吧？" 明日香说道，语气中带着些许懊恼，"天哪！我得说多少遍才行？" 她的声音在结尾处略显沙哑，但她的决心坚定。随着时间的流逝，她的眼眶微微湿润，但她的心意并未动摇。她凝视着真嗣，眼神中充满了深切的决心，仿佛在期待、祈祷她的眼神能传达出她内心深处的信息：她很抱歉。她错了。

She admitted defeat. 她承认了失败。

Shinji sighed in relief. "You know, for a moment, I was afraid you were going to kill me."  
真嗣松了一口气。"你知道吗，有那么一刻，我还以为你要杀了我呢。"

"I'd rather not have my baby girl not have a father," Asuka replied.  
"我宁愿不让我的宝贝女儿没有父亲，"明日香回答道。

"Wait, who said it was a girl? It could be a boy."  
"等等，谁说是个女孩？也可能是男孩。"

"Yes, but it could also be a girl!"  
"是的，但也可能是个女孩！"

"Are we fighting again?" "我们又吵起来了？"

"We damn sure are fighting! I say it's a girl!"  
"我们肯定是在吵架！我说是个女孩！"

"It doesn't even have a gender yet, does it?"  
"它甚至还没有性别，对吧？"

"You know, I honestly don't think so yet."  
"你知道吗，老实说，我还没这么想。"

"We'll have more than enough time to realize if it's a boy or a girl, so don't worry about that," Shinji replied, frowning tensely.  
"我们有足够的时间来确认是男孩还是女孩，所以别担心这个，" 真嗣回答道，眉头紧锁。"

"Alright, I guess so," Asuka replied, rising to her feet, her hands on her stomach, "I'm just bummed that I need to gain weight for this thing! That's going to suck!"  
"好吧，我想也是，" 明日香回答，站起身来，双手放在肚子上，"我只是有点郁闷，为了这小家伙我还得增重！那可真糟糕！"

"You're skinny enough as it is. I doubt even twenty extra pounds would—"  
"你已经够瘦了。我怀疑就算再长二十磅——"

"Twenty!? Who'd say I'd gain that much!?" Asuka's eyes were wide, as though Shinji had just informed her she was dying of terminal cancer. Shinji was mildly surprised by this reaction. You'd think that she'd know about this sort of thing seeing as how she graduated from a German university at the age of 13 AND was a girl.  
"二十磅！？谁说我能长那么多！？" 明日香瞪大了眼睛，仿佛真嗣刚刚告诉她得了晚期癌症。真嗣对这种反应感到有些惊讶。按理说她应该知道这些，毕竟她 13 岁就从德国大学毕业了，而且还是个女孩子。

"I thought everyone knew about—"  
"我以为大家都知道——"

"Don't give me that bull! Well, if I am gaining weight for YOUR child, make me dinner. Now."  
"别跟我来这套！好吧，如果我是因为你的孩子才变胖的，那就给我做饭吧。现在。"

"You're saying that as though I never cook dinner."  
"你这么说好像我从不做饭似的。"

"Yeah? So?" Asuka asked, in a rather harsh tone.  
"是吗？那又怎样？" 明日香问道，语气颇为尖锐。

"Alright, my majesty," Shinji said in a sarcastic tone.  
“好的，我的陛下，”真嗣带着讽刺的语气说道。

#

The stupid idiot was sleeping in bed next to her, but Asuka Langley Sohryu hadn't slept a wink yet. Her hand rested on her torso, absentmindedly adjusting the cloth around her belly. She knew that the baby hadn't even begun to develop yet, but she could almost feel the rug rat kicking. It was strange. Maybe it was a sensation brought up by paranoia, or stress. It was like being next to a sick person and developing a sore throat.  
那个愚蠢的白痴就睡在她旁边的床上，但惣流·明日香·兰格雷还没合过眼。她的手放在腹部，心不在焉地调整着缠绕在肚子上的布料。她知道宝宝甚至还没有开始发育，但她几乎能感觉到那小家伙在踢腿。这很奇怪。也许这是由偏执或压力引起的错觉，就像身边有个病人自己也会喉咙痛一样。

Still, she couldn't imagine herself being a mother. She didn't know the first thing about taking care of a child. What was she going to do? Feed it? Give it a nice, hospitable environment to live in? She could ask her stepmom, but she didn't want to really see her face right now. She knew she had to go back to Germany soon, though, if she was pregnant. Her family had the right to know.  
尽管如此，她无法想象自己成为一个母亲。她对照顾孩子一无所知。她该怎么办？喂它？给它一个舒适宜居的环境生活？她可以问她的继母，但她现在真的不想见到她的脸。她知道如果怀孕了，她很快就得回德国去。她的家人有权知道这件事。

Still, whenever she thought of Germany, the same memory returned to her mind's eye: the image of a doll dangling from a noose next to a limp human corpse, hanging from a similar noose, drifting back and forth, like a pendulum, dead, high above her head, high above the head of her child avatar. She cringed as the memory remained stuck in her brain. It wouldn't go away. It wasn't going away! The damn doll and the damn noose in that damned house! Damn them! Damn them! Damn them all!  
然而，每当她想起德国，同样的记忆就会浮现在她的脑海中：一个玩偶悬挂在绳套上，旁边是一具软绵绵的人类尸体，同样挂在类似的绳套上，来回摆动，像钟摆一样，死气沉沉，高高悬在她的头顶，悬在她孩子化身的头顶。她皱着眉头，记忆如影随形，挥之不去。它不会消失！那个该死的玩偶和该死的绳套在那该死的房子里！该死！该死！该死他们所有人！

She felt a tear roll down her cheek, a tear she brushed away aggressively. She wasn't a kid anymore! She couldn't just cry like that whenever something sad happened. She needed to be strong, stronger than anyone else. She had to be for her daughter—child. She couldn't become caught up in suffering, in the pain of memories of ancient history.  
她感到一滴泪珠滑过脸颊，她用力擦去。她不再是孩子了！不能每次遇到伤心事就那样哭。她需要坚强，比任何人都坚强。为了她的女儿——孩子，她必须如此。她不能沉溺于痛苦，不能被古老记忆的伤痛所困。

Memories of her mother. 关于她母亲的记忆。

**Part 5 第五部分**

"So when's your belly gonna get big?"  
“所以你的肚子什么时候会变大？”

"Shut up!" "闭嘴！"

"My mommy's got big when she had Ryouji."  
"我妈妈生龙二的时候肚子变得好大。"

"Misato, why do we have to baby sit for you right now?" Shinji asked, turning away from Asuka, who was beat red in the face as little Yumi queried her, curiously.  
""美里，为什么我们现在得帮你照顾小孩？"" 真嗣问道，转过身去，只见明日香满脸通红，小优美好奇地向她提问。

Misato, who was currently red in the face as she stared at Yumi asking rather awkward questions to the now pregnant Asuka, replied, with a note of laughter in her voice, "Well, I told you on the phone. Makoto and I need to go to that dinner. The higher ups are going. Fuyutsuki really is working us to the bone." Turning away from Shinji, Misato hastily approached her inquisitive daughter. She was a small little girl, 7 years of age, with a small body, the pudginess of youth still fresh in her body, despite now she'd grown a good deal. She inherited her mother's hair, but needed to wear glasses just like her father. As her mother bent down on a single knee to see her eye-to-eye, Yumi pressed her knuckles anxiously against her lip. "Now, sweetie, look, you can't just ask people like that. They may be, uh, a little sensitive."  
美里此刻满脸通红，她盯着由美，后者正向怀孕中的明日香提出一些颇为尴尬的问题。她带着一丝笑意回答道：“哎，我在电话里不是跟你说了嘛。真琴和我得去参加那个晚宴。高层们都会出席。副司令真是把我们当牛做马了。”美里转身避开真嗣，快步走向她那好奇的女儿。由美是个七岁的小女孩，身材娇小，童年的圆润尚未完全褪去，尽管她已经长高了不少。她继承了母亲的头发，但需要戴眼镜，就像她父亲一样。当母亲单膝跪地与她平视时，由美紧张地用指关节抵住嘴唇。“听着，宝贝，你不能这样随便问别人。他们可能会，呃，有点敏感。”

"What do you mean?" Yumi asked with wide, watery eyes.  
“你是什么意思？”由美睁大水汪汪的眼睛问道。

"I mean, some people are a little sensitive about things like the size of their bellies," Misato replied, trying to be tactful.  
“我是说，有些人对肚子大小这类事情比较敏感，”美里尽量委婉地回答。

"But she isn't really any different from last time," Yumi replied, gesturing towards Asuka, who's torso was indeed nearly as flat as it was last time they had seen her. The only reason Shinji saw any difference at all in Asuka's anatomy was because they were living together. That was it. It was a very subtle change he could only see when she was naked, which was very infrequent to say the least. It was mostly that her abdominal muscles had sort of faded away, or were pushed outward ever so slightly.  
"“但她其实和上次没什么不同，”优米回答道，指着明日香，她的躯干确实和上次见面时一样平坦。真嗣之所以能察觉明日香身体上的任何变化，仅仅因为他们同居了。仅此而已。这是一个非常细微的变化，他只能在明日香裸体时才能看到，这种情况至少可以说是非常少见。主要是因为她的腹肌似乎有些消退，或者说是微微向外推移。”

"Yeah, well, I should be getting used to it," she had replied when Shinji had brought the subject up, "You know, it's weird. I'm a little worried about how my body's going to change, but somehow—WAIT A SECOND! Are you calling me fat or something? Dummkopf!"  
"“是啊，好吧，我应该习惯了，”当真嗣提起这个话题时，她回答道，“你知道，这很奇怪。我对身体的变化有点担心，但不知怎么的——等等！你是在说我胖吗？笨蛋！”

Needless to say, Shinji doubted he'd be bringing up any developments on Asuka's—er—developments.  
"不用说，真嗣怀疑自己不会再提起明日香——呃——身体上的任何变化了。”

"Just don't bring it up, Yumi. Just be a good girl. Aunt Asuka is, well, not all that used to being a mother." Misato rose to her feet after giving her daughter a tight, brief hug, only to turn toward both Shinji and Asuka. "Look, think of it as a learning experience. I mean, think about it: you're going to be raising a baby soon. This is just a warm up act. Ryouji—where's Ryouji?"  
"就别提这事了，Yumi。乖乖听话就好。Asuka 阿姨嘛，嗯，不太习惯当妈妈。" Misato 紧紧地抱了一下女儿，然后站起身，转向 Shinji 和 Asuka。"听着，就当是学习经验吧。我是说，想想看：你们很快就要养育一个宝宝了。这不过是热身罢了。Ryouji——Ryouji 在哪儿？"

Shinji glanced over his shoulder to see five-year-old Ryouji staring at the TV, transfixed by the images on the screen, in awe. He was watching some sort of program that clearly wasn't entirely age appropriate for him. Shinji wondered, absentmindedly, whether or not Misato had let him see this kind of stuff at their house, because neither Misato nor Yumi really reacted to seeing Ryouji watching a brutal action movie. Asuka glanced over him, and drew nearer to him, sitting cross-legged beside him, staring at the glowing screen. She reached for a bag of potato chips, only to rip it open. She picked a few chips from the bag, only to offer a few to Ryouji.  
Shinji 回头一看，只见五岁的 Ryouji 正盯着电视，被屏幕上的画面深深吸引，满是敬畏。他在看某种显然不太适合他年龄的节目。Shinji 心不在焉地想，不知道 Misato 是否让他们家的小孩看这类东西，因为无论是 Misato 还是 Yumi，看到 Ryouji 在看一部残酷的动作片时都没有什么反应。Asuka 瞥了他一眼，然后靠近他，盘腿坐在他旁边，盯着发光的屏幕。她伸手去拿一袋薯片，撕开包装，从袋子里抓了几片，顺手递给 Ryouji 几片。

"Well, it looks like they're getting along well," Misato replied, mildly relieved, "Well, I gotta go!"  
"看来他们相处得不错，" Misato 略感宽慰地回答，"好了，我得走了！"

"Mommy! Can I have a kiss good-bye?" Yumi replied. Ryouji offered no such sentiment, completely consumed by the program.  
"妈妈！我可以得到一个告别吻吗？" 由美回答道。良治对此毫无表示，完全沉浸在程序中。

"Okay." Misato hastily leaned in, kissed her daughter's forehead, only to dart out of the apartment, running for her car, eager to dart off to that dinner so she wouldn't need to be late. She left Shinji and Asuka alone with two children. It was only when the responsibility was fully deposited on Shinji that he panicked.  
"好的。" 美里匆忙俯身，亲吻了女儿的额头，随即冲出公寓，奔向她的车，急切地想要赶去那顿晚餐，以免迟到。她留下真嗣和明日香独自照顾两个孩子。直到责任完全落在真嗣身上，他才开始慌张。

Watching Misato's children? What a crazy idea! He didn't know how to raise them! He didn't know the first thing about raising a child, but maybe that was the point. He'd just need to get to know them, that was all. How hard could it possibly be. "I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't—"  
看着美里的孩子？多么疯狂的想法！他不知道如何抚养他们！他对抚养孩子一无所知，但也许这就是重点。他只需要了解他们，仅此而已。这能有多难。 "我不能逃跑。我不能逃跑。我不能——"

"What're you doing, Uncle Shinji?" Yumi asked, curiously.  
"你在做什么，真嗣叔叔？" 由美好奇地问道。

"Huh? Nothing, don't worry." Turning to Yumi, anxious grimace on his face, he asked, curiously, "Well, what do you guys like to eat?"  
"嗯？没什么，别担心。" 他转向由美，脸上带着焦虑的苦笑，好奇地问，"那么，你们喜欢吃什么呢？"

"I want miso soup," Ryouji called from the TV, not turning around.  
"我要味噌汤，" 亮司从电视那边喊道，没有回头。

"Don't listen to him!" Yumi replied, "He doesn't know what he wants. Can you make some riceballs?"  
"别听他的！" 由美回答，"他根本不知道自己想要什么。你能做些饭团吗？"

"Miso soup!" Ryouji shouted, turning around to face Yumi.  
"味噌汤！" 亮司喊道，转身面对由美。"

"Miso stinks! Riceballs are better!"  
"味噌臭死了！饭团更好！"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Why does this look so familiar?" Asuka asked, curiously.  
"为什么这看起来这么眼熟？" 明日香好奇地问道。

"Don't know," Shinji replied, "I usually don't fight back, and when I do, you usually hit me."  
"不知道，" 真嗣回答，"我通常不还手，而我一还手，你通常就会打我。"

"Good point." "说得好。"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Miso!" "味噌！"

"Rice!" "米饭！"

"Shouldn't we be doing something to break them up?" Shinji asked.  
"我们不应该做点什么来阻止他们吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah, I know! Make some German food!" Asuka declared.  
“耶，我知道了！做些德国菜吧！”明日香宣布道。

"What?" Both Yumi and Ryouji turned toward the red head, curiously, "What's German food?"  
“什么？”优米和凌二都好奇地转向红发女孩，“德国菜是什么？”

"Mein Gott! You don't know what German food is?" Asuka asked, a sly smile on her lips, "Well, that's okay. Shinji, make it."  
“我的天哪！你们不知道德国菜是什么？”明日香问道，嘴角带着一丝狡黠的微笑，“好吧，没关系。真嗣，你来做。”

"What? What do you want me to make?"  
"什么？你想让我做什么？"

Blushing, Asuka turned to Shinji, and loudly whispered into his ear, hastily. "I don't know! Just make something! Make Wiener Schnitzel. We have the ingrediants for that, right?"  
脸红的明日香转向真嗣，急忙凑到他耳边大声耳语道：“我不知道！随便做点什么吧！做维也纳炸肉排。我们有做那个的材料，对吧？”

"Yeah, I think so." "嗯，我想是的。"

"Well, get on it! I'm hungry!" Asuka whispered.  
“快点动手吧！我饿了！”明日香低声催促道。

"Wait, aren't we making this for the kids?" Shinji asked, glancing at the German through narrowed eyes.  
“等等，我们不是在做给孩子们吃的吗？”真嗣眯起眼睛，瞥了一眼德国人问道。

"Yeah! That's right. The kids. Right." Asuka pulled away, and turned toward the kids. "Hey, I have a question for you. You guys wanna play a video game?"  
“对啊！没错。孩子们。对。”明日香退开一步，转向孩子们。“嘿，我问你们个问题。你们想玩电子游戏吗？”

"What kind of game?" Ryouji asked, eagerly.  
"什么游戏？" 亮司问，急切地。

"I don't like those games," Yumi replied, anxiously pushing up her glasses.  
"我不喜欢那些游戏，" 由美回答，焦虑地推了推眼镜。

"What? Afraid you can't beat me?" Asuka replied, a sneer on her lips.  
"什么？怕赢不了我？" 明日香回答，嘴角带着一丝嘲讽。

"No I'm not!" Yumi insisted, balling up her hands into pudgy fists.  
"不，我没有！" 由美坚持道，将她的小手握成胖乎乎的拳头。

"Oh really? Then play!" "哦，真的吗？那就来吧！"

"I will!" "我会来的！"

As Shinji made the German food, which really wasn't all that hard to do considering it was mostly a fried dish, she glanced over at Asuka as she played her game. Even though she was behaving much like a child herself, the children were having fun with her. She knew how to let them have a good time, knew what to say, even though it sometimes was a little mean. He knew, right then and there, that she was ready to be a mom. She would make an amazing mother for his son—er, child.  
当真嗣做着德国菜时，考虑到这主要是一道炸食，其实并不难做，她瞥了一眼正在玩游戏的明日香。尽管她自己表现得就像个孩子，但孩子们和她在一起玩得很开心。她知道如何让他们玩得尽兴，知道该说什么，尽管有时有点刻薄。他当时就明白，她已经准备好成为一个母亲了。她会成为他儿子——呃，孩子的出色母亲。

But would he really make all that good of a father?  
但他真的会成为一个好父亲吗？

"Shinji, for a Japanese person, you can at least cook decent German food," Asuka said, sampling the plate of fried food with an almost nostalgic glint in her eyes, "I've trained you well."  
“真嗣，作为一个日本人，你至少能做出像样的德国菜。”明日香说着，品尝着那盘炸食，眼中闪过一丝怀旧的光芒，“我把你训练得不错。”

"Trained? All you did was buy me a German cook book and told you to make German stuff. You didn't train me at all," Shinji replied, his eyes narrowed.  
"训练？你不过是给我买了本德国烹饪书，然后让我做德国菜。你根本没训练我，" 真嗣回答道，眼睛眯了起来。

"It's the same difference."  
"其实差不多。"

"This isn't half-bad," Ryouji replied as he nibbled on some of the dish.  
"这还不赖嘛，" 良治边说边尝了几口菜。

"It's too fried," Yumi replied, disgusted, "I still want rice balls!"  
"太油腻了，" 优米回答，一脸厌恶，"我还是想吃饭团！"

"German food beats rice balls," replied Asuka, simply, with an amused grin, but not one without a hint of malice, "If you want rice balls that badly, I'm sure the invincible iron chef Shinji could make you some."  
"德国菜可比饭团强多了，" 明日香简单地回答，带着一丝戏谑的笑意，但也不乏一丝恶意，"如果你那么想吃饭团，我相信无敌的铁厨真嗣肯定能给你做几个。"

"It wouldn't be a problem," Shinji replied, smiling.  
"那不成问题，" 真嗣微笑着回答。"

"Ah! So the invincible Shinji rises up to the challenge of making rice balls for a little girl," Asuka said, making Yumi giggle slightly, "I guess he can do just about anything! Even cook decent German food without a drop of that great blood in his system."  
"啊！看来无敌的 Shinji 要挑战为小女孩做饭团了，" Asuka 说道，逗得 Yumi 轻声笑了起来，"看来他无所不能！甚至能在没有那伟大血统的情况下做出像样的德国菜。"

"Great blood?" Shinji replied, finishing his meal, which he had to say was too fried, wasn't his taste, and he would probably make rice balls for himself to get the lousy taste out of his mouth, "I don't know about that."  
"伟大血统？" Shinji 回答道，结束了他的晚餐，他不得不说这顿饭太油腻了，不合他的口味，他可能会为自己做些饭团来去除嘴里的糟糕味道，"我不太确定。"

"Germany is the greatest nation in the world," Asuka proclaimed, "And don't you forget it, dummkopf!"  
"德国是世界上最伟大的国家，" Asuka 宣称，"你可别忘了，笨蛋！"

"Speaking of Germany, have you called your parents yet about you're, uh, pregnancy?" Shinji asked as he withdrew the rice cooker from a cabinet.  
"说到德国，你给父母打电话了吗？关于你，呃，怀孕的事？" 真嗣一边问，一边从橱柜里拿出电饭煲。

"Oh, my parents?" Shinji glanced over at his fiancé. Her eyes glanced down at her dish as she ran her hands through her hair, averting her gaze from anyone's eyes. "I actually, uh, haven't even told them we were engaged yet."  
"哦，我父母？" 真嗣瞥了一眼他的未婚妻。她的目光落在自己的盘子上，双手梳理着头发，避开了所有人的视线。"其实，呃，我还没告诉他们我们订婚了。"

"You haven't?" Shinji stammered. That entire time Shinji had asked Asuka if she had asked her parents if they were going to be at the wedding, and yet, all this time, she hadn't. There had to be a reason, just had to be, why she wouldn't inform her own family of such an important occasion.  
"你还没说？" 真嗣结巴道。这段时间里，他一直问明日香是否已经告诉她父母他们要结婚的事，然而，她却一直没说。一定有什么原因，一定有，为什么她不告诉自己的家人这么重要的时刻。

"Yeah, uh, sorry?" "嗯，呃，抱歉？"

"Don't worry about it. When are you going to tell them? They do deserve to know."  
"别担心。你打算什么时候告诉他们？他们确实有权知道。"

"I'll call 'em eventually. Sooner than later. Maybe." Once again, she averted her gaze.  
""我迟早会打电话给他们的。尽快吧。也许。"" 她再次移开了视线。

"You can't run away from this," Shinji replied.  
"你逃不掉的，" 真嗣回答道。

"Coming from you, Mr. 'I Mustn't Run Away', I don't think you're in any position to be telling me that," Asuka replied, snidely, but not harshly.  
"从你这位'我不能逃跑'先生嘴里说出来，我觉得你没资格这么说我，" 明日香尖刻地回应，但并不严厉。

"But I mean, you rarely mention your parents, but I'm sure they miss you," Shinji said, smiling, "I mean, they can't be anything like my father was." Upon stating that, the words "my father," an image emerged in Shinji's brain. An image of himself, years from now, having grown a chin-strap beard like his father, staring down at his future son, a weedy awkward youngster much like he had been, huddled in a corner as he, Shinji, reprimanded him, speaking in Shinji's voice but in an uncharacteristically harsh tone, a cruel tone that sounded like a man by the name of Gendo Ikari. Shinji ran a hand through his hair as he pulled out the bag of rice, scooping enough rice for two people, and Asuka because he knew she'd want some, along with some for Ryouji in case he was jealous of his elder sister.  
"但我的意思是，你很少提到你的父母，但我确信他们想念你，" 真嗣微笑着说，"我是说，他们不可能像我父亲那样。" 说到这里，"我父亲"这几个字在真嗣脑海中浮现出一个画面。画面中的自己，多年以后，留着像他父亲那样的下巴胡须，低头看着未来的儿子，一个瘦弱笨拙的少年，就像他曾经那样，蜷缩在角落里，而真嗣自己则在训斥他，用真嗣的声音却带着一种异常严厉的语气，一种残酷的语气，听起来像是叫源堂·碇的男人。真嗣用手梳理了一下头发，拿出米袋，舀了足够两人份的米，还有明日香的份，以及一些给凌二，以防他嫉妒他的姐姐。

Asuka didn't seem to notice Shinji's stress. "Yeah, well, I guess you're right. Still, I'm not sure how happy I'd be if my stepmom started to act like she really cared if I was getting married or not."  
明日香似乎没有注意到真嗣的压力。“嗯，好吧，我想你是对的。不过，我不确定如果我的继母开始表现得好像真的很在意我是否结婚，我会感到多高兴。”

"She cares," Yumi declared, balling up her fists passionately, "Mothers always care about stuff like that!"  
“她关心，”优米坚定地握紧拳头，充满激情地说，“母亲总是关心这类事情的！”

Frowning slightly, Asuka replied, "I don't know about that."  
明日香微微皱眉，回答道：“我不太确定这一点。”

"Besides, what's a stepmom?" Ryouji asked.  
"再说了，什么是继母？" 龙二问道。

Asuka was about to answer when Yumi interrupted her. "Don't you know anything? A stepmommy is a mommy you have after your real mommy goes away! A girl in my class has a stepmommy."  
明日香正要回答，却被由美打断了。"你什么都不懂吗？继母就是当你亲生妈妈离开后，你有的新妈妈！我班上有个女孩就有个继母。"

"You mean mommy's going to leave me?" Ryouji stammered, tears in his eyes.  
"你是说妈妈要离开我吗？" 龙二结结巴巴地说，眼里含着泪水。

Neither Shinji or Asuka responded.  
无论是真嗣还是明日香都没有回应。

"Of course she isn't, silly!" Yumi replied, reproachfully, "Mommy isn't going anywhere. It's just what happens if you get a divorce, that's all. And your mommy doesn't leave you, really. She just lives somewhere else. My friend at school sees her mommy all the time—"  
"当然不会，傻瓜！" 由美反驳道，"妈妈哪儿也不会去。只是离婚了就会这样，仅此而已。而且你妈妈并没有离开你，真的。她只是住在别的地方。我学校的朋友就经常见到她妈妈——"

"Can we please change the subject?"  
"我们能换个话题吗？"

Shinji glanced over at his fiancé to see a sight he had never, in all his years, expected to see out of the blue like this. Asuka's head was slumped over, her face almost completely covered by the shadows of her bangs. A small moist gasp for air escaped her throat as a small, beady tear rolled down the strong German's cheek. Shinji could only stare in shock as she brushed the tear aside with her knuckle, only for a second tear to replace the first. What was wrong with her? Just talking about mothers brought her to tears? Just what the hell happened to Asuka's mother? Was she involved in a bitter divorce? Was her mother arrested for drug abuse? Did she die? The truth was that Asuka had never, in all the years she knew her, mentioned the status of her real mother. Occasionally, and by occasionally she meant rarely, she'd mention her family in Germany, but never would she mention her real mother.  
真嗣瞥了一眼他的未婚妻，看到了一幅他多年来从未预料到会突然出现的景象。明日香的头低垂着，她的脸几乎完全被刘海的阴影遮住。她喉咙里发出一声微弱的湿润喘息，一颗小泪珠从这位坚强的德国女孩的脸颊上滚落。真嗣只能震惊地看着她用指节擦去泪水，随即第二颗泪珠又取而代之。她怎么了？仅仅谈论母亲就让她流泪了吗？明日香的妈妈到底发生了什么？她是否卷入了痛苦的离婚？她的母亲是否因吸毒被捕？她去世了吗？事实是，明日香从未在她所知的这些年里提及过她亲生母亲的情况。偶尔，她指的是极少的时候，她会提到她在德国的家人，但绝不会提及她的亲生母亲。

Except for the immediate aftermath of Third Impact.  
除了第三次冲击刚发生后的那段时间。

He approached his fiancé, and put a comforting hand on her shoulder. She glanced up. Her sky blue eyes were filled with tears she struggled to hold back, her stiff upper lip struggling against quivering sobs. Her face was contorted as it fought the war against crying, against showing her true feelings. As Shinji bent down to embrace her, the proud German continued to resist the tears. Even as she buried her face into spot between his shoulder and chest, she chose to whip the tears that had yet to fall against Shinji's shirt rather than let them slip down her face.  
他走向未婚妻，轻轻地将手放在她的肩上。她抬头望向他，天蓝色的眼眸中盈满了泪水，她努力抑制着不让它们落下，紧绷的嘴唇与颤抖的呜咽抗争。她的脸因与哭泣的斗争而扭曲，努力不显露真实的情感。当真嗣弯腰拥抱她时，这位骄傲的德国女孩仍在抗拒泪水。即使她将脸埋在他肩与胸之间的位置，她选择将尚未滑落的泪水甩在他的衬衫上，而不是让它们顺着脸颊流淌。

"You stupid idiot," Asuka mumbled, her words interrupted for a brief second by an uncontrolled sob, a sob she struggled to quench.  
“你这个笨蛋，”明日香喃喃道，话音被一个无法控制的呜咽打断了一瞬，她努力压制着这个呜咽。

"Aunt Asuka? Are you okay?" Yumi asked, concerned. She put a back on her "aunt's" back. Ryouji too took a closer look, a glint of fear in his eyes for her safety. Slowly, she rose out from her position, with muted sobs.  
“明日香阿姨？你还好吗？”由美担心地问。她将手放在她“阿姨”的背上。亮司也仔细观察着，眼中闪过一丝对她安危的担忧。慢慢地，她从原来的位置站起身，压抑着呜咽。

"I'm fine," Asuka replied, running a hand through her hair, glancing at them all, "Let's just not talk about that kind of stuff, okay? It just isn't something I really enjoy talking about."  
"我没事," 明日香回答，用手梳理着头发，瞥了他们一眼，"我们别谈那些了，好吗？那不是我真正喜欢谈论的话题。"

"Am I in trouble?" Yumi asked, a terrified glint in her eye.  
"我会惹上麻烦吗？" 优米问，眼中闪过一丝恐惧。

"No, you're not in trouble."  
"不，你没惹麻烦。"

"Are you going to tell my mommy?" Yumi asked, even more concerned.  
"你要告诉我妈妈吗？" 优美问，更加担忧了。

"I don't think I will," Asuka replied, grimacing in amusement, "Well, actually, I might, but just so she'd talk to you privately about it, maybe."  
"我觉得我不会，" 明日香回答，带着一丝戏谑的苦笑，"嗯，其实，我可能会，但只是为了让妈妈私下和你谈谈，或许。"

"Okay," Yumi replied, resigning to her fate.  
"好吧，" 优美回答，无奈地接受了命运。

After finishing the Weiner Schnitzel, Shinji prepared the rice balls that Yumi had so desperately begged for, and that Shinji so desperately craved. Asuka was playing her games once more with Ryouji, and Yumi was rummaging through her backpack for something that Shinji could not see. As he set out the rice balls on the table, announcing their completion, she watched as Yumi pulled out a large sketchbook, an object she gazed upon with a look of sheer pride. She approached Asuka, and tapped her on the shoulder. This surprised her, which gave Ryouji a perfect opportunity to deliver a fatal blow to her character, leaving her open to a humiliating stage Fatality. Her eyes widened in horror as she watched her character fly through the air, fall through space, and land with a sickening splatter against a carpet of iron spikes. With a look of sheer mortification and fury, she rounded on Yumi. "What is it?!" she snapped, as though she had just caught Yumi stealing something precious away from her.  
吃完维也纳炸肉排后，真嗣准备起了由美子苦苦哀求、而他本人也渴望至极的饭团。明日香正和亮司再次玩着游戏，而由美子则在背包里翻找着什么，真嗣看不清。当他将饭团摆上桌，宣告完成时，他看到由美子抽出了一本大画册，她凝视着它，脸上满是自豪。她走向明日香，轻拍她的肩膀。这让她吃了一惊，给了亮司一个绝佳的机会，对她的角色施以致命一击，让她暴露在令人羞辱的舞台终结技之下。她惊恐地睁大眼睛，看着自己的角色飞过空中，穿过空间，最终以令人作呕的声响落在一片铁刺地毯上。带着极度的尴尬和愤怒，她转向由美子。“什么事？！”她厉声问道，仿佛刚刚抓到由美子偷走了她的珍贵之物。

Yumi, who looked as though Asuka was about to bludgeon her with a battle axe, and in all honesty it looked like Asuka would have found that to be a rather suiting punishment for distracting her, extended the notebook to the German and cried, frightened, "I'm sorry! I just wanted to show you something to make up for before! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"  
优子看起来就像明日香要拿战斧劈她一样，说实话，明日香似乎觉得这种惩罚对分散她注意力的人来说相当合适。她将笔记本递给德国女孩，惊恐地哭喊道：“对不起！我只是想给你看点东西来弥补之前的过失！对不起！真的很抱歉！”

"Stop saying you're sorry."  
“别再说对不起了。”

"Yes, sorr—er—" “是的，对不——呃——”

"You take after that idiot, don't you?" Asuka asked, gesturing over to Shinji, who stared at Asuka with a look of confusion. She just had to drag him into this, didn't he? Drag him into a conversation that didn't involve him. Well, despite that, the little girl was clearly amused by Asuka calling Shinji an idiot. Her expression calming, perhaps after rationalizing that loosing to a little child at a fighting game once wasn't the end of the world nor should it be, she accepted the notebook, and glanced at the first page. "Wow, this is actually pretty good for a seven year old. Did you draw this?"  
"你还真像那个笨蛋，不是吗？" 明日香问道，指了指一旁的真嗣，后者一脸困惑地看着明日香。她非得把他扯进来吗？扯进一个与他无关的对话里。不过，这个小女孩显然被明日香称真嗣为笨蛋逗乐了。她的表情缓和下来，或许是在理性思考后认为，输给一个小孩子在格斗游戏里一次并不是世界末日，也不应该如此，她接过笔记本，瞥了一眼第一页。"哇，作为一个七岁孩子，这画得真不错。这是你画的吗？"

"Uh-huh," Yumi said, proudly.  
"嗯哼，" 由美自豪地说道。

As Asuka flipped through the pages, she continued, "I mean, no stick figures, just real looking people. When I was your age, I—I—" Asuka's eyes widened slowly as she stared at one individual page, her mouth contorting as she struggled to find words to describe what she was trying to say. Yumi glanced at her, relatively confused. She probably wasn't sure whether Asuka being speechless was a good or bad omen. She glanced over Asuka's shoulder to see the picture in question, only to smile.  
明日香翻阅着页面，继续说道："我是说，没有火柴人，都是栩栩如生的人物。我像你这么大的时候，我——我——" 明日香的眼睛慢慢睁大，她盯着其中一页，嘴巴扭曲着，努力寻找合适的词汇来描述她的感受。由美疑惑地看着她，不太确定明日香说不出话是好是坏。她凑到明日香肩后，想看看那幅画，随即露出了微笑。

"Oh! I really like that picture."  
"哦！我真的很喜欢那张画。"

Shinji wanted to inch nearer, but she was sure Asuka would explain it later. He finished the rice balls as Asuka asked, in a strained tone, "How did you, uh, draw this?"  
真嗣想再靠近一点，但她确信明日香稍后会解释。他按照明日香的要求吃完了饭团，明日香用一种紧张的语气问道：“你是怎么，呃，画出这个的？”

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"Did you copy from a picture?"  
“你是照着图片临摹的吗？”

"Oh! No! Nothing like that! I met someone who looked like that, and I thought she was really cool looking, so I sketched her. I asked her to pose and everything."  
"哦！不！不是那样的！我遇到了一个看起来像她的人，我觉得她看起来很酷，所以就给她画了张素描。我还请她摆姿势呢。"

"Asked her to pose?" "请她摆姿势？"

"Uh-huh." "嗯嗯。"

"Are you lying to me?"  
"你在骗我吗？"

"Why would I be lying to you?" Yumi's expression grew tense, as though she were afraid of Asuka yelling at her once more. "It's just another person. I asked her to do a few drawings for me, too. No, wait, that's not what I meant. I meant to say I drew her a few other times, I mean. Sorry if I wasn't clear."  
"我为什么要骗你？"" 优美的表情变得紧张，仿佛害怕明日香再次对她大吼。""只是另一个人而已。我也请她帮我画了几幅画。不，等等，我不是那个意思。我是说我给她画了几次，我是说。如果我没说清楚，对不起。"

Glancing over at Shinji, Asuka snapped, "Dummkopf! Get over here!"  
瞥了一眼真嗣，明日香厉声道：“笨蛋！快过来！”

"What?" "什么？"

"You heard me! Look at this drawing!"  
"你听到了！看看这幅画！"

Shinji darted over, mildly happy that the rice balls were at the very least finished. She wondered what could possible surprise Asuka this much. It took a lot to startle his fiancé. Judging by the comments she made, he doubted the German was stunned by the artistic ability of this special younger. In fact, he felt it was something much more, something important, that would startle him upon looking at the picture.  
真嗣迅速凑了过去，略感欣慰至少饭团已经做好了。她好奇是什么能让明日香如此惊讶。要让他的未婚妻感到震惊可不容易。从她的评论来看，他怀疑德国人并非被这位特殊小辈的艺术才能所震撼。实际上，他觉得这背后隐藏着更为重要、更为惊人的东西，一旦看到那幅画便会明白。

It didn't take long to see what Asuka was so shocked about.  
没过多久，就明白了明日香为何如此震惊。

"Is that who I think it is?" Shinji stammered, his eyes wide in horror.  
"那是我以为的那个人吗？" 真嗣结巴着说，眼中充满了恐惧。

"I can't believe this," Asuka stammered, "Maybe it's a look alike."  
"我简直不敢相信，" 明日香结巴着说，"也许只是长得像而已。"

"It's gotta be. Hey, Yumi, what was the name of this girl?"  
"肯定是。嘿，由美，这个女孩叫什么名字？"

Smiling brightly, Yumi replied, "She said her name was Rei. Rei Ayanami."  
笑容灿烂地，优米回答道：“她说她的名字是绫波丽。”

**Part 6 第六部分**

"I want to see the remains of Rei Ayanami."  
“我想看看绫波零的遗体。”

"What? Right now?" "什么？现在吗？"

"Yes!" "是的！"

Asuka was still trembling, her balled up fists squeezed, her nails almost piercing her soft palm. She couldn't believe it. That little kid, Yumi, Misato's daughter, had drawn a picture of Rei Ayanami! That stupid doll! That bitch! Asuka couldn't deny that one of the things she was mildly happy about when she returned to the real world was that living doll no longer existed. Her remains, the monstrous mutilated pieces of her that drifted in the sea of LCL, had been collected by NERV and deposited in a deep underground vault. By now, information regarding Rei Ayanami had become public to NERV personal only thanks to Misato's investigation and Fuyutsuki's revelations. Asuka couldn't deny that most of the information regarding the blue haired witch didn't surprise her.  
明日香仍在颤抖，紧握的拳头挤压着，指甲几乎刺入她柔软的掌心。她无法相信。那个小鬼，美里的女儿，由美，居然画了一幅绫波零的画！那个愚蠢的玩偶！那个婊子！明日香不得不承认，当她回到现实世界时，她略感欣慰的事情之一就是那个活生生的玩偶不再存在了。她的残骸，那些在 LCL 海洋中漂浮的可怕残肢，已被 NERV 收集并存放在一个深地下的保险库中。如今，关于绫波零的信息仅对 NERV 内部人员公开，这多亏了美里的调查和冬月的揭露。明日香不得不承认，关于那个蓝发女巫的大部分信息并未让她感到惊讶。

"Why do you want to?" Fuyutsuki asked, mildly irritated. Asuka handed over Yumi's notebook to the Commander, a grim expression on her face. "What's this? A kid's sketchbook?" The book was opened to the drawing of Rei Ayanami, at which he shook his head. "Could just be coincidence."  
"你为什么要这么做？" 冬月问道，语气中带着些许不悦。明日香将由美的笔记本递给指挥官，脸上带着严肃的表情。"这是什么？一个孩子的素描本？" 书本翻到了绫波零的画页，他摇了摇头。"可能只是巧合。"

"She specifically said she drew someone she had seen on the street. AND she referred to her as Rei Ayanami. What more evidence do you need?" Asuka snapped.  
"她明确说了她画的是在街上看到的人。而且她还称她为绫波零。你还需要什么证据？" 明日香厉声说道。

"Who drew this?" "这是谁画的？"

"Misato's daughter." "美里小姐的女儿。"

"Oh, well, maybe she saw a picture or heard her mother mention her name," Fuyutsuki replied.  
"哦，也许她看到了一张照片，或者听她妈妈提到了她的名字，" 冬月回答道。

"That's what I asked. She said she didn't copy a picture, and Misato would never mention Rei around her daughter."  
"我也是这么问的。她说她没有复制照片，而且美里绝不会在她女儿面前提起丽。"

"How do you know that?"  
"你怎么知道这些的？"

"Well, who'd want to?" Asuka asked.  
"哼，谁会想要呢？" 明日香问道。

Fuyutsuki grimaced in submission. "You really despised that girl, didn't you? Rei, I mean."  
冬月皱眉表示屈服。"你真的很讨厌那个女孩，对吧？我是说绫波。"

"Yes," Asuka replied, not giving further explanation, not remembering how that girl had received so much attention from her superiors despite being the weakest of the pilots, not remembering how that blue haired bitch had stolen Shinji's attention, not remembering just how that bitch reminded her of dolls.  
"是的，"明日香回答，没有进一步解释，不记得那个女孩是如何尽管是最弱的驾驶员却得到了上级的那么多关注，不记得那个蓝发婊子是如何抢走了真嗣的注意力，不记得那个婊子是如何让她想起了那些玩偶。

A noose hanging from the rafters.  
从椽子上悬挂下来的绳套。

"Something wrong?" Fuyutsuki asked, curiously.  
“有什么不对劲吗？”冬月问道，带着好奇。

"It's nothing," Asuka replied, shaking her head, "I still have to have access to Rei's body! I want to see it, now."  
“没什么，”明日香回答，摇了摇头，“我还需要接触丽身体！我现在就想看看。”

"Fine, if you insist that badly, I'll give you temporary clearance. Just don't touch anything."  
"好吧，既然你这么坚持，我就给你临时通行证。只是别乱碰东西。"

#

"The pot's boiling over," Toji called over to his wife, staring at the oven in mild fear as he hastily chopped vegetables.  
"锅要溢出来了，" 真嗣对着妻子喊道，一边紧张地盯着烤箱，一边匆忙切着蔬菜。"

"Can you get it, please?" Hikari called from another room, "I'm kinda busy here."  
"你能处理一下吗？" 光从另一个房间喊道，"我这里有点忙。"

"I don't know—" "我不知道——"

"I'll handle it," Shinji replied, rising to take care of the pots of food on the oven.  
"我来处理，" 真嗣回答道，起身去照看烤箱上的锅子。

"Aw, thanks a lot," Toji replied, a smile of relief on his face.  
"啊，真是太感谢了，" 东治回答，脸上露出释然的微笑。

"Don't worry." Shinji enjoyed cooking by this point. He did it all the time for Asuka, so by now, he was used to preparing food. In fact, he had grown to enjoy it rather much. He didn't know why, but the idea that he was creating something with his own hands, blending tastes, playing God over the dishes of food, and, in the end, seeing other people smile because of him. It sent a wave of pride throughout his body, as though he was doing something right.  
"别担心。" 此时的真嗣已经很喜欢烹饪了。他经常为明日香做饭，所以现在已经习惯了准备食物。事实上，他甚至开始相当享受这个过程。他不知道为什么，但亲手创造东西的想法，调配味道，掌控着食物的命运，最终看到别人因为他而露出笑容。这让他全身涌起一股自豪感，仿佛他做对了什么。

"So how's the pregnant devil?" Toji asked, curiously, from his chopping.  
"那怀孕的小恶魔怎么样了？" 正在切菜的冬二好奇地问。

"Eh, she's fine," Shinji replied, "She's just looking at something right now, over at NERV."  
"呃，她挺好的，" 真嗣回答，"她现在正在 NERV 那边看什么东西。"

"What's that?" Toji asked.  
"那是什么？" 冬二问道。

"Not sure," Shinji lied. "不太确定，" 真嗣撒了个谎。

"Oh, okay," Toji replied.  
"哦，好吧，" 冬二回答道。

"Toji, could you get me diapers?" Hikari called out.  
“冬二，你能帮我拿些尿布吗？” 光喊道。

"Uh, okay!" Toji sprinted to a cabinet full of diapers, grabbed one, and muttered, as he ran off, in a rather hasty mantra, "Please don't let me change her diapers, please don't let me change her diapers, please don't let me change her diapers…" After a few moments, he returned, an expression of relief on his face.  
“呃，好的！” 冬二冲向一个装满尿布的柜子，抓起一片，边跑边急促地念叨，“千万别让我给她换尿布，千万别让我给她换尿布，千万别让我给她换尿布……” 过了一会儿，他回来了，脸上带着释然的表情。

"I guess you didn't change the diapers?" Shinji asked, tending to the rest of the food on the oven.  
“我猜你没换尿布吧？” 真嗣问道，忙着烤箱里剩下的食物。

"Very funny." Returning to his chopping, Toji asked, mildly, "So is your future wife having cravings yet?"  
"真搞笑。" 回到切菜中，Toji 温和地问，"那么，你未来老婆开始有孕期反应了吗？"

"Cravings?" Shinji asked.  
"孕期反应？" 真嗣问道。

"Yeah, you know, cravings. For food, you know," Toji asked.  
"对，你知道的，孕期反应。对食物的那种，明白吧，" Toji 问道。

"Not that I can think of," Shinji replied, thinking of the wide variety of food he served at home.  
"我想不起来有什么特别的，" 真嗣回答道，想起了家里提供的各式各样的食物。

"Hikari had to have lots of beets when she was pregnant," Toji replied, "I don't know why beets, but she just needed them. Knowing Asuka, she'll probably be craving some random German food."  
"光怀孕的时候特别想吃甜菜，" 渡回答，"我不知道为什么是甜菜，但她就是需要。以明日香的性格，她可能会突然想吃些德国菜吧。"

"Well, it's a good thing she's been teaching me how to cook that sort of stuff," Shinji replied.  
"嗯，还好她一直在教我怎么烹饪那些东西，" 真嗣回答。

"Really?" "真的吗？"

"Yeah, she even taught me a bit of German," Shinji replied.  
"是啊，她甚至还教了我一点德语，" 真嗣回答道。"

"Did she charge you money for lessons?"  
"她收你学费了吗？"

"No, she just wanted help learning how to read and write kanji."  
"不，她只是想寻求帮助学习如何读写汉字。"

"You mean she can't read kanji? How long has she been in this country now?"  
"你是说她不会读汉字？她来这个国家多久了？"

"German's her native language, and that's VERY different from Japanese," Shinji replied, "I barely know German, just a few words." Shinji was being humble here and defending his fiancé; he had picked up German pretty easily; it was Asuka who had extreme difficulty with Japanese.  
"德语是她的母语，那和日语差别非常大，" 真嗣回答道，"我对德语几乎一窍不通，只知道几个词。" 真嗣在这里表现得谦虚，并为自己的未婚妻辩护；他其实很容易就学会了德语；反而是明日香对日语感到极其困难。"

"Oh, okay, that's fine," Toji replied, "I know a bit of English only because I've gone on business trips to America, but that's it."  
"哦，好的，没关系，" 冬二回答道，"我只因为出差去过美国，所以懂一点英语，仅此而已。"

"Toji!" "冬二！"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"Can you make sure Shinji doesn't come into the parlor?"  
"你能确保真嗣不进客厅吗？"

"Why's that?" "为什么呢？"

"I'm breast feeding and I don't want him to see."  
"我在哺乳，不想让他看到。"

Shinji imagined, for a brief moment, Hikari placing her dear son's lips to her plumped bosom. The gentle sounds of sucking, the gentle rocking back and forth, a rhythmic pattern that almost made Shinji—  
真嗣短暂地想象了一下，光将她亲爱的儿子的嘴唇贴在她丰满的胸脯上。那轻柔的吮吸声，轻轻地前后摇晃，一种近乎让真嗣——

"You're thinking dirty thoughts about Hikari, aren't you?" Toji asked, through narrowed eyes, "Stop it. Now."  
"你肯定在想些对光不纯洁的事，对吧？" 冬二眯着眼睛问道，"别想了，现在就停下。"

#

There her body was, resting in an artificial lake of LCL. Bobbing back and forth, clearly dead, her vacant unseeing eye staring directly at Asuka. She was dead, long dead. This gigantic, titanic entity, kept in a massive vault underground at NERV, was all that remained of her. She was dead! There was no way Yumi could've possibly seen that doll alive. There just wasn't any way.  
她的身体就那样躺在人造的 LCL 湖中，随波逐流，显然已经死去，那空洞无神的眼睛直勾勾地盯着明日香。她早已死去，长眠于此。这个庞大无比的巨型存在，被安置在 NERV 地下深处的巨大保险库中，仅剩她的遗骸。她已经死了！由美不可能看到那个玩偶还活着。这根本不可能。

"Satisfied?" Asuka turned to see Misato Katsuragi behind her, a small smile on her lips.  
"满意了吗？" 明日香转身看到身后的葛城美里，她嘴角挂着一丝微笑。

"How did you—" "你怎么——"

"Fuyutsuki told me all about it," Misato replied, "Yumi has quite an imagination, huh?"  
"冬月都告诉我了，"美里回答，"由美子想象力真丰富，对吧？"

"Are you hiding anything from me?" Asuka asked, inquisitively.  
"你有什么事瞒着我吗？"明日香好奇地问。"

"Hiding? Why would I do that?" Misato replied, surprised.  
"躲藏？我为什么要那么做？" 美里回答，感到惊讶。

"Seriously, are you? I can keep a secret, I just need to know if that doll is out there."  
"说真的，你是吗？我能保守秘密，我只是需要知道那个玩偶是否在外面。"

"Doll?" Misato laughed, "So that's what this is all about."  
"玩偶？" 美里笑了，"原来这就是问题的关键。"

Asuka's face contorted in rage. "What the hell does that mean?"  
明日香的脸因愤怒而扭曲。“那他妈是什么意思？”

"It all makes sense now. Rei reminded you of your mother's—"  
“现在一切都明白了。丽让你想起了你母亲的——”

"Shut up!" Asuka snapped, clamping her hands over her ears as she turned away. The damage was done, though. In her mind's eye, clear as day, she could see it, a body hanging from the rafters by a noose, a doll swinging back and forth at its side. Upon opening her eyes, she could see a planet sized doll staring back at her, a crooked grin on its face, laughing at her even in death. She wanted to throw something at that bitch, that dead looking face that sneered at her, but couldn't. She couldn't damage that piece of carrion, or Fuyutsuki would flip out.  
“闭嘴！”明日香厉声打断，双手紧紧捂住耳朵转身背对。但伤害已经造成。在她脑海中，那画面清晰如白昼，一具尸体悬挂在横梁上，绳索缠绕，旁边一个玩偶来回摆动。睁开眼时，她看到一个星球大小的玩偶正盯着她，脸上挂着歪斜的笑容，即使在死亡中也在嘲笑她。她想朝那婊子扔点什么，那张死气沉沉的脸嘲弄着她，但她做不到。她不能伤害那具尸体，否则冬月会发疯的。

"I'm sorry," Misato replied, frowning, "Have you told Shinji about that?"  
"对不起，" 美里皱着眉回答，"你告诉真嗣这件事了吗？"

"No," Asuka replied after a moment of silence.  
"没有，" 明日香沉默片刻后回答。

"I think you should. It'll help get a lot off your chest," Misato replied.  
"我觉得你应该告诉他。这样会让你心里轻松很多，" 美里回答。

"I'm fine. I'll handle it on my own."  
"我没事。我自己能处理。"

"Shinji shared everything from his past with you, right? Shouldn't you do the same?"  
"真嗣把他过去的所有事情都告诉你了，对吧？你不也应该这样做吗？"

Sighing, the German replied, running a hand through her hair, "He has enough to worry about. I wouldn't want to pile another burden on him. I already ask him to make me food and clean the house. If I were to ask him to help carry all my problems on his back, I think I'd be asking too much of him. The least I can do is carry his burdens and mine. That way, we're even."  
叹了口气，这位德国人回答道，一边用手梳理着她的头发，"他已经有够多烦心事了。我不想再给他增加负担。我已经让他给我做饭和打扫房子了。如果我还要他帮我背负所有的问题，我觉得我要求得太多了。至少我能做的，是承担起他的负担和我的。这样，我们就扯平了。"

"But I think he'd want to carry your burdens. It would be his way of saying things are okay," Misato replied.  
"但我想他会愿意替你分担重担的。这将是他用行动表达一切都会好起来的方式，"美里回答道。

"I don't want him to, so shut up about it, already!"  
"我不想让他这么做，所以别再提了！"

"Alright, I understand," Misato replied, "Oh, and by the way, regarding Yumi and the whole thing with your mother, I took care of it, like you asked."  
"好吧，我明白了，"美里回答，"哦，对了，关于由美和与你母亲相关的那件事，我已经按照你的要求处理好了。"

"What did you say?" Asuka asked.  
"你说什么？" 明日香问道。

"That your mother was dead and it was a touchy subject for you."  
"说你母亲去世了，这对你是敏感话题。"

"Did you say anything else?"  
"你还说了别的吗？"

"Not at all." "一点儿也不。"

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

#

"I'm home," Shinji replied, ignoring the fact that the house was silent and the lights were off. He walked in, removing his shoes only to walk over to the stove. He was about to set a pot to boil when he heard it: a phone ringing. He glanced at it, curiously. Was it Toji? Had he left something there by accident? Or maybe it was Asuka, telling him something about Rei that she had discovered. He approached the phone, nonchalantly, and answered it. "Hello?"  
"我回来了，" 真嗣回答道，无视了房子里寂静无声、灯火全灭的事实。他走进门，脱下鞋子，径直走向炉灶。正准备把锅放上去烧水时，他听到了电话铃声。他好奇地瞥了一眼。是东治吗？他是不是不小心落下了什么东西？或者是明日香，告诉他发现了关于绫波的什么事情。他漫不经心地走向电话，接了起来。"喂？"

"Hallo? Wer ist dieses?" "喂？是谁啊？"

"Huh?" Shinji stammered, surprised to hear an unfamiliar female voice on the other side of the phone, "Excuse me?"  
"啊？"" 真嗣结巴道，惊讶于电话那头传来一个陌生的女性声音，""不好意思，您是？"

"Ist Asuka dort?" "请问是明日香吗？"

"Uh, Asuka?" Shinji tried to remember some of the German he had learned from his fiancé, and decided to speak. "Uh, she's not home right now. Who is this?"  
"呃，明日香？" 真嗣试图回忆他从未婚妻那里学到的德语，决定开口说话。"呃，她现在不在家。您是哪位？"

"This is her sister." "我是她姐姐。"

"Wait, sister?!" Shinji stammered, "She has a sister?"  
"等等，姐姐？！" 真嗣结巴道，"她有个姐姐？"

"Yes, she does. Who're you, exactly?"  
"是的，她是。你到底是谁？"

"I'm Shinji, her fiancé," he said, on instinct. It was only after the words came out of her mouth that he realized what he had just said, and how Asuka's sister wouldn't know that they were engaged.  
"我是真嗣，她的未婚夫，"他本能地说道。直到话从她嘴里说出来后，他才意识到自己刚刚说了什么，以及明日香的妹妹不会知道他们订婚了。

There was a moment of silence before the voice on the other line asked, curiously, "Verlobtes?"  
电话那头沉默了一会儿，然后好奇地问道："订婚？"

"Uh, yeah, uh…" "呃，是的，呃…"

"When did this happen!?" "这是什么时候发生的！？"

"A month or two ago."  
"大约一两个月前。"

"And she didn't tell us?"  
"她没告诉我们吗？"

"Uh, I thought she did."  
"呃，我以为她说了。"

There was a period of silence again before Asuka's sister snapped, "So when are you going to come to Germany."  
又是一阵沉默，随后明日香的姐姐厉声问道：“那你什么时候来德国？”

"Germany!?" "德国！？"

"Who're you talking to?" a familiar voice behind him asked in a cold, dark tone.  
"你在跟谁说话？" 一个熟悉的声音在他背后冷冷地问道，带着一丝阴暗的语气。

"Oh, uh, hi Asuka. You wouldn't believe who just called just now…"  
"哦，呃，嗨，明日香。你绝对猜不到刚才谁打电话来了……"

---
**Part 7 第七部分**

"SHINJI, YOU IDIOT!" “真嗣，你这个笨蛋！”

"I'm sorry! I didn't realize—"  
"对不起！我没意识到——"

"You idiot! Don't talk, just stay quiet!" Asuka snapped, pacing back and forth, her hands balled up in fists as she glared venomously at her fiancé. It wasn't that she was really made at him, but it was a hell of a lot easier to shout at him than it was to shout at her sister over in Germany for calling her like that. Asuka was about to call her, too, once she found out what was up with Yumi drawing Ayanami. Still, the revelation that her sister had called while her back was turned was enough to make her forget momentarily about Wonder Girl. "You shouldn't have said you were my fiancé!"  
"你这个白痴！别说话，安静点！" 明日香厉声喝道，来回踱步，双手紧握成拳，恶狠狠地瞪着她的未婚夫。倒不是她真的对他生气，只是对他大吼比对远在德国的姐姐大吼要容易得多。明日香本来也打算打电话给姐姐，一旦她弄清楚由美为什么会画绫波零。然而，得知姐姐在她转身时打来电话的事实，足以让她暂时忘记了对绫波零的疑惑。"你不该说你是我的未婚夫！"

"Why not?" Shinji asked. "为什么不行？" 真嗣问道。

"Because now I'm going to have to go back to Germany and drag you along with me," Asuka snapped.  
"因为现在我不得不回德国，还得把你也拖上，"明日香厉声说道。

"But I thought you felt Germany was the greatest nation in the world," Shinji replied, his eyes narrowed.  
"但我觉得你认为德国是世界上最伟大的国家，"真嗣回答，眼睛眯了起来。

"Yeah, well, it is, but I hate having to see my parents!" The sounds of her father and stepmother making love echoed through her head, a sound superimposed to the memories of her mother in her hospital ward, stroking the doll she believed to be her daughter. She shook the memories out of her head before continuing her point. "They just bother me, alright?"  
"是啊，没错，但我不喜欢不得不见我的父母！"她父亲和继母做爱的声音在她脑海中回响，这声音与她母亲在医院病房里抚摸着她认为是自己女儿的玩偶的记忆重叠在一起。她摇摇头，把这些记忆甩开，继续说道。"他们就是让我心烦，行了吧？

"Okay, fine, but you were going to have to tell them eventually," Shinji replied.  
"好吧，行，但你迟早得告诉他们，" 真嗣回答道。

"Not necessarily," she replied.  
"不一定，" 她回答说。

"Were you just going to run away?"  
"你只是打算逃跑吗？"

"Don't throw that rhetoric at me, you stupid house broken male!" Asuka snapped, pointing at her fiancé with a look of utter disdain. Sure, his frail backbone was holding firm for this instance, but it wasn't enough to persuade Asuka that she was being unreasonable. He didn't know her family, nor did he know just why she wanted to avoid them like the plague. Then again, it wasn't his place to know. She had just wanted to keep him away from that side of her, and yet it had come to drag Shinji deeper into her tangled web of suffering. Sighing for a moment, inhaling in an attempt to calm herself, she said, her face beet red, "We need to figure out how we can do this."  
"别用那套说辞来对付我，你这个被驯化的蠢男人！" 明日香厉声喝道，指着她的未婚夫，脸上满是鄙夷。没错，他那脆弱的脊梁这次倒是挺得笔直，但这还不足以说服明日香她是在无理取闹。他不了解她的家庭，也不知道她为何像躲避瘟疫一样避开他们。再说了，他也没必要知道。她只是想让他远离自己的那一面，然而事与愿违，这反而让真嗣更深地陷入了她痛苦的纠葛之中。她叹了口气，深吸一口气试图平复心情，脸涨得通红，说道："我们需要想个办法来解决这件事。"

"When are we going over there, again?"  
"我们什么时候再去那边？"

#

"When was the last time you came over here?"  
"你上次是什么时候来这儿的？"

"Too long, Kate," Asuka had said in a falsely sweet sounding voice, speaking real, fluent German for the first time in months. She was surprised to hear a slight Japanese accent in her tone. She had been away from her motherland for too long, and yet, at the same time, was hesitant to go back there for years in fear she'd have to speak to her parents again.  
"太长了，凯特，" 明日香用一种假甜的声音说道，几个月来第一次流利地说起了真正的德语。她惊讶地发现自己语调中带有一丝日本口音。她离开祖国太久了，然而与此同时，又因多年害怕不得不再次与父母交谈而犹豫是否回去。

"Well, I hear you have a fiancé," her sister Kate had replied in an inquisitive tone. Her sister wasn't like Asuka. As opposed to her, Kate lacked the fourth of Japanese blood her mother had given her. All she had was the Langley blood, but not the Sohryu blood. That's what made her different, made her an alien.  
"嗯，我听说你有个未婚夫，" 她的姐姐凯特用一种好奇的语气回答。她的姐姐不像明日香。与她相反，凯特缺乏母亲赋予她的四分之一日本血统。她只有兰格利家族的血统，却没有惣流家的血统。这就是让她与众不同，让她成为一个异类的原因。

"Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you, but things have been so hectic I completely forgot," Asuka replied.  
"是的，我一直想告诉你，但事情太忙乱了，我完全忘记了，" 明日香回答道。

"I can imagine, what with wedding plans and all that. So who is the lucky man. Shinji? Isn't that the name of the Third Child?"  
"我能想象，毕竟婚礼计划什么的。那么，那位幸运的男士是谁？真嗣？那不是第三适格者的名字吗？"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Wow, I thought you said that guy was an idiot!"  
"哇，我记得你说过那家伙是个笨蛋！"

"Well, he is. A complete and utter idiot, housebroken, stupid, and just—just—"  
"嗯，他就是。一个彻头彻尾的傻瓜，驯服了，愚蠢，而且——就是——就是——"

"Aw, it sounds adorable!" Kate had squealed. Asuka had cringed at the sound of her voice. She resented everything about that girl. It wasn't her fault she was her stepmother's daughter, but that didn't mean she'd just accept Kate with open arms or anything. "So when's the wedding?"  
"啊，听起来好可爱！" 凯特尖叫道。明日香听到她的声音就皱起了眉头。她对那个女孩的一切都感到厌恶。虽然不是她的错，她是继母的女儿，但这并不意味着她会张开双臂欣然接受凯特。"那婚礼是什么时候？"

"What?" "什么？"

"The wedding. When is it?"  
"婚礼。什么时候举行？"

"Oh, that. Well, we're planning on having it in a few months."  
"哦，那个啊。我们打算几个月后办。"

"When are you guys planning on having a baby?"  
"你们打算什么时候要孩子？"

"A little under nine months."  
"差不多九个月后。"

She did despise slips of the tongue.  
她确实讨厌口误。

"What was that?" “那是什么？”

"Nothing! Nothing at all," Asuka replied, frantically, "I didn't say anything!"  
“没什么！一点也没有，”明日香慌忙回答，“我什么都没说！”

"Did you say nine months?"  
"你说九个月？"

There was no point now. She might as well just bite the bullet. Resenting her sister's inquisitive nature with a wave of fury, damning Shinji for getting her into this situation, she said, in an uncharacteristically high voice, "Uh, well, I said less than nine months."  
现在说什么都没用了。她索性豁出去算了。带着一股怒气，怨恨姐姐的好奇心，咒骂真嗣把她拖入这种境地，她用异常尖锐的声音说道：“呃，好吧，我说的是不到九个月。”

"What? Tell me everything. Now."  
"什么？快告诉我一切。现在。"

"Well, you know, stuff happened, and, uh, Kate! Stop giggling!" she snapped, her face filling with a radiant scarlet glow.  
"哎，你知道的，事情发生了，呃，凯特！别笑了！" 她厉声说道，脸上泛起一片绯红的光彩。

"I can't help it! It's just too rich! You a mother!"  
"我忍不住！这太有趣了！你居然成了妈妈！"

"Oh shut up!" "哦，闭嘴！"

"So when're you coming over to introduce your fiancé?"  
"那你什么时候带未婚夫过来介绍给我们认识？"

Asuka had sighed, shaking her head. She had ran a hand through her hair, wondering when a good time would be. She wouldn't have minded coming over on February 30th, or maybe the day after the End of Time. However, she couldn't just say that to her sister. She glanced over at Shinji, considering for a moment to ask him for advice, only to turn away, harshly. That bastard was the reason she was put into this situation; the last thing she wanted was to hear his voice right now. "I don't know. What time's good for you?"  
明日香叹了口气，摇了摇头。她用手捋了捋头发，思索着何时是合适的时间。她并不介意在 2 月 30 日，或者也许是时间尽头后的第二天过来。然而，她不能就这样告诉她姐姐。她瞥了一眼真嗣，考虑了一会儿是否要向他寻求建议，结果却猛地转过头去。那个混蛋是她陷入这种境地的原因；她现在最不想听到的就是他的声音。“我不知道。你什么时候方便？”

"Hang on a sec. Mom wants to talk to you." Asuka had cringed yet again. Just what she needed, her damn stepmother on the line. Clenching her fists into tight little balls, she had waited until that little brat deposited the phone in her mother's hands, only to count the seconds until that dreaded voice rang through the phone.  
"稍等一下。妈妈想跟你说话。"明日香再次皱起了眉头。真是她需要的，她那该死的继母在电话那头。她紧握拳头，等待着那个小鬼把电话交给她的母亲，然后开始数秒，直到那个令人畏惧的声音通过电话传来。

"Hello, dear?" At the sound of that voice, the woman had become a girl once more, a girl running through German air, running toward a door beyond which remained a dead corpse hanging from the rafters. She had held the memories at bay as she had focused on the then and there, in Japan, in Tokyo-3, NOT in Germany.  
"亲爱的，你好吗？" 听到那个声音，女人瞬间变回了女孩，一个在德国天空中奔跑的女孩，朝着一扇门跑去，门后是一具悬挂在横梁上的尸体。她一直将这些记忆拒之门外，专注于当下和那里，在日本，在第三新东京市，而不是在德国。

"Hello, mother!" Asuka had called out in a forced cheery tone, "How are you?"  
"你好，妈妈！" 明日香用一种刻意欢快的语气喊道，"你还好吗？"

"What's this I hear about you getting married?"  
"我听说你要结婚了，这是怎么回事？"

She did indeed cut straight to the point. Recovering from her momentary stunned silence, she had replied, with a forced smile on her face and a force girlish laugh in her voice, "Aw, sorry I didn't tell you before. So much has happened lately I've just forgotten to tell you that sort of thing. I hope you can forgive me." Oh how she had just wanted to tell that stupid bitch that she had avoided calling her this whole time. Had it not been for that idiot picking up the phone, she'd still avoid communication with that woman. It wasn't like she was her real mother anyway.  
她的确直截了当地切入主题。从短暂的震惊沉默中恢复过来，她脸上强挤出笑容，声音里带着刻意的少女般笑声，回答道：“哎呀，对不起，之前没告诉你。最近发生了太多事，我忘了告诉你这些。希望你能原谅我。”哦，她多么想直接告诉那个愚蠢的婊子，她这段时间一直避免给她打电话。如果不是那个白痴接了电话，她还会继续避免与那个女人联系。反正她也不是她的亲生母亲。

"It's quite alright. I suppose I can forgive you, but next time, please tell your family about such major developments, alright?"  
“没关系。我想我可以原谅你，但下次，请务必告诉你的家人这些重大变化，好吗？”

"Sure, okay." “当然，好的。”

"Such as you going about and making me a grandmother without ever informing me."  
"比如你四处走动，让我成了祖母，却从未告知我一声。"

Asuka had wanted to shout out that her stepmother could rest assured that she wasn't the baby's grandfather and that Kyoko Sohryu was the legitimate grandmother, but, once again, she held that indignation inside of her chest as she had replied, in a sugary tone, "I'm sorry about that too!"  
明日香本想大声反驳，告诉她的继母大可放心，她绝不是那孩子的祖父，而绫波零才是合法的祖母，但又一次，她将那份愤慨压在胸中，用甜腻的语气回答：“我也为此感到抱歉！”

"So who is this man, anyway?"  
"那么，这个男人究竟是谁？"

"Oh, Shinji Ikari." "哦，碇真嗣。"

"Oh, you mean that pilot you worked with?"  
"哦，你是说那个你合作过的驾驶员？"

"The same." "正是他。"

"We're all very proud of what you did as a child, you know. I think all of Germany would rejoice at your wedding." Truthfully, judging by how the NERV building was damaged in Japan, she seriously doubted that any nation would rejoice about the union of two small individuals. Clearly her stepmother was trying to play up her pride, an aspect of herself that had deflated gradually over the years. Regardless, it did boost her spirits up slightly, if only for a moment.  
"我们都非常为你小时候的成就感到骄傲，你知道的。我想整个德国都会为你的婚礼欢欣鼓舞。" 说实话，鉴于日本 NERV 大楼受损的情况，她严重怀疑任何国家会对两个小人物的结合感到高兴。显然，她的继母试图夸大她的自豪感，这是她多年来逐渐消退的一面。尽管如此，这确实让她的心情稍微振奋了一些，哪怕只是片刻。

"Oh, I doubt that," Asuka had replied, honestly, "Anyway, it's been great talking to you, but I'm going to have to—"  
"哦，我对此表示怀疑，" 明日香诚实地回答，"不管怎样，和你聊天很愉快，但我得——"

"When will you be coming over to introduce us to the Third Child?"  
"你什么时候带第三适格者来见我们？"

The moment she had hoped to avoid. "Oh, uh, I don't know, I have a lot of work to do, so I don't know when I'll be able to get over there."  
她一直希望避免的那一刻。“哦，呃，我不知道，我有很多工作要做，所以我不确定什么时候能过去。”

"You can arrange something with your superiors, I'm sure. I'm sure they let people off for brief vacations and maternity leave and the like."  
“你肯定能和你的上司安排一下。我相信他们会允许人们休短暂的假期、产假之类的。”

This was very true. They did let Misato off TWICE for maternity leave, AND took several vacations to spend time with her children, and she had a higher position than either of them did. Fuyutsuki would have no problem giving them time off to visit Germany, much to her dismay. "I'll need to ask." No doubt she'd forget to ask Fuyutsuki and end up replying to her mother that her boss was a jerk that refused to let her take time off. That sounded like a good alibi, until her stepmother spoke.  
这确实没错。他们确实让美里休了两次产假，并且还多次休假去陪伴她的孩子，而她的职位比他们俩都高。冬月会毫不犹豫地给他们放假去德国，这让她非常沮丧。“我需要问问。”毫无疑问，她会忘记问冬月，最终回复她母亲说她的老板是个拒绝让她请假的混蛋。这听起来像是个不错的借口，直到她的继母开口说话。

"Don't worry. I'll just have your father make a call for you."  
"别担心。我让令尊打个电话帮你搞定。"

Damn it! That bitch thought of everything, didn't she? "What? Oh, I don't think you'd need to go to all that trouble!"  
该死！那个婊子真是面面俱到，不是吗？“什么？哦，我觉得你没必要费那么大劲！”

"Oh, no trouble at all! He was going to need to have a telephone conference with your Commander Fuyutsuki regardless in order to settle an affair regarding a German railway system. I'm sure if he asked your boss he'd be delighted to help."  
"哦，一点儿也不麻烦！他本来就需要和你们的指挥官冬月进行一次电话会议，商讨关于德国铁路系统的事务。我相信如果他向你的上司提出请求，他一定会乐意帮忙的。"

"Oh, really, you don't need to go to that much trouble—"  
"哦，真的，你不必这么麻烦——"

"No trouble at all! Shall I request that you're available for, say, two weeks from today so you'd be able to get your affairs in order?"  
"一点儿也不麻烦！我是否可以请求您从今天起的两周内都有空，这样您就能安排好您的事务了？"

"Oh, that should be fine," Asuka resigned.  
"哦，那应该没问题，"明日香无奈地答应道。

"Good. I'll see you in a bit, then. Gute Nacht!"  
"好。那我一会儿见。晚安！"

#

"Two weeks, huh?" Shinji replied, in stunned silence, "That's a little quick."  
"两周，是吗？" 真嗣震惊地沉默了一会儿，"这有点快。"

"She'll hold us to it, you know. There's no way I can avoid it," Asuka sighed in resignation.  
"她会坚持的，你知道的。我没法逃避，" 明日香叹息着接受了现实。"

"It can't be that bad, can it?" Shinji replied, "I mean, you knew this was going to happen sooner or later, so you might as well go ahead and reach out for it." Shinji had never heard the German mention much about her family, so this reaction she had didn't exactly surprise her. The sister hadn't sounded mean on the phone, and the conversation she had with her mother—er, stepmother—didn't sound too unpleasant, so why was it so difficult for her to actually muster the courage to see them? It just didn't add up. Maybe it had something to do with her birthmother.  
"应该没那么糟糕吧，不是吗？" 真嗣回答道，"我是说，你知道这迟早会发生，所以还不如干脆去面对它。" 真嗣从未听这位德国女孩过多提及她的家庭，所以她的这种反应并不让她感到特别惊讶。电话里她的姐姐听起来并不刻薄，而她和母亲——呃，继母——的对话也不算太不愉快，那为什么她就是难以鼓起勇气去见她们呢？这说不通。也许这与她的生母有关。

"What do you think I should do now?" Asuka asked Shinji in a desperate tone.  
"你觉得我现在该怎么办？" 明日香用一种近乎绝望的语气问真嗣。

#

"What do you think I should do now?" Asuka had cried out as fists had beat against the door of the NERV building.  
"你觉得我现在该怎么办？" 明日香哭喊着，拳头重重地敲打在 NERV 大楼的门上。

"I don't know! Grab something! Anything! Barricade the door!" Shinji had shrieked, grabbing every sort of reinforcement he could grab his hands on as he jammed it against the locked door, be it metal bars, pieces of wood, or even dead bodies that had begun to pile up along the ground, the dead bodies riddled with bullets, bodies of comrades who they had allied themselves with along their escape from the concentration camp. It was at moments that these that he was glad that their now dead comrades had the foresight, and the bravery, to sacrifice their lives in order to disable their weapons.  
“我不知道！抓点什么！什么都行！堵住门！” 真嗣尖叫着，抓起他能抓到的所有加固物，无论是金属棒、木块，甚至是开始堆积在地上的尸体，那些尸体布满了弹孔，是他们从集中营逃亡途中结盟的战友。在这些时刻，他庆幸那些已故的战友有先见之明和勇气，牺牲自己的生命来破坏敌人的武器。

Shinji glanced over his shoulder, seeing bloody masses of bodies, some still alive, most dying, many younger than he was. Their wide, terrified eyes staring at the banging beyond the door, a pulsating rhythmic slamming that was almost in synch with Shinji's own heartbeat, powerfully beating against the interior of his ribcage as he reinforced the door, praying that they'd live, praying that he'd be able to build up the walls between him and the enemy long enough for them to escape.  
真嗣回头瞥了一眼，看到血肉模糊的尸体群，有些还活着，大多数奄奄一息，其中许多比他还年轻。他们惊恐的大眼睛盯着门外的撞击声，那有节奏的砰砰声几乎与真嗣自己的心跳同步，有力地撞击着他的胸腔，他在加固门的同时祈祷他们能活下来，祈祷他能建立起足够坚固的屏障，让他们有足够的时间逃脱。

Was this any different from the battles against the Angels? Was it? They were relentless, maybe even worse, maybe just as dangerous. He needed to face his fears and save himself. Otherwise, what did he really learn after all that horror three years earlier in Third Impact?  
这与对抗使徒的战斗有何不同？是吗？它们无情，或许更甚，或许同样危险。他需要直面恐惧，拯救自己。否则，经历了三年前第三次冲击的恐怖后，他究竟学到了什么？

And over his gasping for air, his terrified attempts to live, he could hear the once proud German whispering to herself, in terrified, harsh tones: "I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die."  
在他喘息求生、惊恐挣扎之际，他听到那位曾经骄傲的德国人用恐惧而严厉的语气自言自语：“我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。我不想死。”

They weren't going to die.  
他们不会死。

Not like this. 不是这样的。

They were closed off in a tiny little room, filthy, bloodstained, and defenseless. There was no hope for survival if those doors gave. They had to make sure it was impossible for the enemy to get in, for those monsters to penetrate their sanctuary. The militia was just a new government that had hoped to regain power in the collapsed regime. Like most of the horrible, destructive groups, it had united under a relatively peaceful philosophy: eliminating evil. A good idea in theory, except the leader, a Jewish zealot, had a deep seated grudge against the Germans because of the Holocaust. Once again, in and of itself, not a terrible opinion. The Nazis had done horrible things to the Jews. However, like all believes, no matter how pure, when pushed to its extreme, it became rotten. The zealot had decided that all Germans were secretly Nazis, and that, in order to avoid a second Holocaust of Jews, he needed to create a Holocaust of Germans. They created dozens of concentration camps just like the Nazis had, all for the same intention: tormenting and killing their enemies.  
他们被关在一个狭小肮脏的房间里，血迹斑斑，毫无防备。如果那些门被攻破，生存的希望将荡然无存。他们必须确保敌人无法闯入，那些怪物无法侵犯他们的避难所。民兵只是一个新成立的政府，希望在崩溃的政权中重掌权力。像大多数可怕的破坏性团体一样，它在一个相对和平的理念下团结起来：消灭邪恶。理论上是个好主意，只是领导者，一个犹太狂热分子，因大屠杀而对德国人怀有深仇大恨。这本身并不是一个糟糕的观点。纳粹对犹太人犯下了可怕的罪行。然而，像所有信仰一样，无论多么纯洁，一旦推向极端，就会腐化。这位狂热分子认定所有德国人都是秘密纳粹分子，为了防止犹太人再次遭受大屠杀，他需要制造一场针对德国人的大屠杀。他们建立了数十个集中营，就像纳粹所做的那样，目的都是为了折磨和消灭他们的敌人。

Shinji became involved when Asuka had been captured, and he along with her for being a "German lover."  
真嗣之所以卷入其中，是因为明日香被捕，而他则因为被视为“德国人的情人”而一同被抓。

They had been sent out by the then unofficial NERV to help with the peace effort, and now they were dragged into a damn war! He just wanted the banging to stop. He wished his mother was there, that Ayanami was there, to save them, to maybe salvage them from the wreckage. But he couldn't wish for miracles now. He had received his fair share of miracles already. There was no time for praying; the time to act was nigh.  
他们曾被当时的非官方组织 NERV 派遣，协助和平事业，如今却被卷入了一场该死的战争！他只希望那震耳欲聋的声响能停止。他多么希望母亲在那里，绫波也在那里，来拯救他们，或许还能从废墟中挽救他们。但他现在不能奢望奇迹。他已经得到了足够多的奇迹。没有时间祈祷了；行动的时刻即将到来。

And then he heard it: gunshots. Gunshot after gunshot echoed through the air, and the sounds of bodies hitting the floor rang even through the thick defenses. Regardless of the gunfire and screams of zealots, Shinji didn't dare lower his guard. There was always a chance the conflict outside would be resolved. He knew the zealots couldn't be the ones shooting, as they didn't have anymore firearms to use. Surely it was a rival militia, perhaps worse than the last. He wouldn't give in now. Maybe, with a bit of lucky, they'd leave the facility alone and let them make a safe escape. Just maybe the zealots would forget about the escapees and let them return to Tokyo-3 safely. Even though it wasn't stable yet, it was a hell of a lot better than Europe right now! Even America would be safe, but Europe was a hell hole at the present time that no one should have the misfortune to dwell in.  
然后他听到了：枪声。一声接一声的枪响在空气中回荡，厚重的防御也挡不住身体倒地的声音。尽管枪声和狂热者的尖叫此起彼伏，真嗣丝毫不敢放松警惕。外面冲突总有解决的可能。他知道那些狂热者不可能在开枪，因为他们已经没有更多武器可用。肯定是另一支敌对民兵，或许比上一次更糟糕。他现在绝不会屈服。也许，只要运气好一点，他们会放过这个设施，让他们安全逃脱。也许狂热者会忘记逃亡者，让他们安全返回第三新东京市。尽管那里还不稳定，但总比现在的欧洲好得多！即使是美国也会安全，但欧洲现在是个地狱，谁都不该有幸生活在那里。

And then there was silence. For a moment, Shinji didn't breathe. For five moments, there was silence. And, after the sixth moment, Shinji drew breath. Turning to his comrades, he said, in a harsh tone, "I think we made it."  
然后是一片寂静。有那么一刻，真嗣屏住了呼吸。五秒钟，一片寂静。第六秒过后，真嗣深吸了一口气。转向他的同伴，他用严厉的语气说：“我想我们成功了。”

#

"When was the last time you were even in Germany?" Shinji asked, curiously.  
“你上次去德国是什么时候？”真嗣好奇地问。

"Well, in the Concentration Camp," Asuka replied.  
"嗯，在集中营里，" 明日香回答道。

"Yeah, but that militia is gone now, so I know that's not what's bothering you," Shinji replied.  
"是啊，但那支民兵现在已经不在了，所以我知道这不是困扰你的原因，" 真嗣回答。

"Yeah, because crazy people trying to kill me is something you just forget after a few days."  
"是啊，因为那些试图杀我的疯子，你不可能几天后就忘得一干二净。"

"Asuka." “明日香。”

"Alright, I just don't want to see my parents. Is that so horrible? You didn't want to see your father after all!"  
“好吧，我只是不想见我父母。这有那么可怕吗？你不是也不想见你父亲吗！”

Once again, the image of himself in the future dominating his child like his own father had dominated him flashed in Shinji's mind. He suppressed the image, only to focus on his fiancé once more, a slightly anxious expression on her face. "What's wrong? You can talk to me about it if it really bothers you."  
又一次，未来自己像父亲曾经支配他那样支配孩子的画面在真嗣脑海中闪现。他压制住这个画面，重新将注意力集中在未婚妻身上，她脸上带着一丝焦虑。“怎么了？如果真的困扰你，可以和我谈谈。”

"It's nothing." "没什么。"

"No it's not." "不，不是的。"

"Really, don't worry about—"  
"真的，别担心——"

"Here you are just running away from your problems again. I thought you outgrew that, you idiot."  
"你又是在逃避问题。我以为你已经改掉了，你这个笨蛋。"

Frowning again, Shinji replied, distantly, "I'm just afraid I'll end up being just as good of a father as mine was."  
再次皱起眉头，真嗣遥远地回答道：“我只是害怕我会成为一个像我父亲那样糟糕的父亲。”

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

"Well, I know I won't be nearly as bad of a dad as he was, I just can't shake the feeling that I'll somehow hurt my child, or maybe he'll hurt me alternatively because I'm afraid of hurting him. I don't know what to think, but I'm just afraid something bad will happen because I wouldn't know what to do."  
"嗯，我知道我不会像他那样糟糕地成为一个父亲，但我就是无法摆脱那种感觉，觉得我会在某种程度上伤害我的孩子，或者也许他会因为我害怕伤害他而反过来伤害我。我不知道该怎么想，我只是害怕会发生什么坏事，因为我不知道该怎么办。"

The redhead examined him with a raised eyebrow before drawing nearer. She lazily flicked him in the forehead, at which she snapped, "Dummkopf! You're stupider than I thought if that's what you're worried about being like that idiot."  
红发女子扬起眉毛打量着他，然后靠近了一些。她懒洋洋地弹了一下他的额头，随即厉声说道：“笨蛋！如果你担心变成那个白痴那样，那你可真是比我想的还要蠢。”

"How is it stupid? It's a very legitimate fear!"  
“这怎么蠢了？这是一个非常合理的担忧！”

"Well, tell me this: are you going to emotionally abandon your kid?"  
"那么，告诉我：你会不会在情感上抛弃你的孩子？"

"No."

"Are you going to make him pilot a gigantic robot?"  
"你会让他驾驶巨大的机器人吗？"

"I don't think so." "我不这么认为。"

"Are you going to focus on a creepy blue haired girl more than him?"  
"你打算把注意力更多地放在那个蓝头发的诡异女孩身上，而不是他吗？"

"Not likely." "不太可能。"

"Then you'll be fine. What're you worried about?" Asuka replied, sitting back on her bed, exhaling slowly as she muttered to herself, "But my mother, on the other hand…"  
"那你就不用担心了。你在担心什么呢？" 明日香回答道，坐回自己的床上，缓缓呼出一口气，喃喃自语，"但另一方面，我的母亲……"

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"Nothing. I was just thinking about my mother—er, I mean, stepmother."  
"没什么。我只是在想我的母亲——呃，我是说，继母。"

"Oh, okay," Shinji replied, convinced, "I'm guessing you don't get along with her?"  
"哦，好吧，" 真嗣回答，信服了，"我猜你跟她相处得不太好？"

"Yeah, I suppose." "是啊，我想是的。"

"Do you want to talk about it?" Shinji asked.  
"你想谈谈这件事吗？" 真嗣问道。"

Smiling slyly, Asuka replied, "Dummkopf! If I started telling you everything wrong with me, then I'd really realize I'm in a pathetic state."  
阿斯卡狡黠地笑了笑，回答道："笨蛋！如果我开始告诉你我所有的错处，那我才会真正意识到自己有多可悲。"

"So I can tell you things, but not the other way around?"  
"所以我可以告诉你事情，反过来就不行？"

"Basically. Now go to bed. We have two weeks before we go to Hell."  
"基本上是这样。现在去睡觉吧。我们还有两周就要去地狱了。"

**Part 8 第八部分**

"Attention passengers, we will be landing in Germany in approximately 10 minutes. Thank you for flying—"  
女士们先生们，我们将在大约 10 分钟后降落在德国。感谢您的飞行——

"Thank God we're here! My butt is so damn sore!" Asuka groaned, pushing herself up as she massaged her rear end.  
"谢天谢地我们到了！我的屁股疼死了！" 明日香呻吟着，一边按摩着自己的臀部一边挣扎着站起来。

"I don't think you should be getting up right now," Shinji replied, glancing over at his fiancé with a mildly concerned expression.  
"我觉得你现在不该站起来，" 真嗣回答道，瞥了一眼他的未婚妻，脸上带着些许关切的表情。

"And why not, you id—" The airplane their were currently inside tossed slightly, knocking Asuka back onto her seat. After the momentary expression of shock faded away, she stammered, struggling to revive her self-importance, "Oh, if you didn't catch me off guard like that, I wouldn't have fallen like that! You idiot!"  
"为什么不行，你这个笨——" 他们所在的飞机轻轻颠簸了一下，把明日香又摔回了座位上。短暂的震惊表情过后，她结结巴巴地试图恢复自己的尊严，"哦，如果不是你让我措手不及，我才不会摔倒呢！你这个笨蛋！"

Frowning, Shinji glanced up at his redhead fiancé. There was a note of anxiety in her eyes, a note of terror that Shinji couldn't explain. Sure, the memories of their last visit to Germany was bad, but surely, SURELY, that couldn't be the only reason Asuka didn't want to go to Germany, to return to her parents. Surely there was something else, surely some other motivation holding her back, another memory, one that she refused to let him know.  
皱着眉头，真嗣抬头看向他的红发未婚妻。她的眼中流露出一丝焦虑，一丝真嗣无法解释的恐惧。确实，他们上次去德国的经历很糟糕，但肯定，肯定不会仅仅因为这个原因，明日香就不想回德国，不想回到她的父母身边。肯定还有别的原因，肯定有其他动机让她犹豫不前，有另一个她拒绝让他知道的记忆。

Why wasn't she letting him in? He let her in all the time, but now when something was personal for her, she refused to let him know anything. She had been acting agitated all day, shouting at him the entire way up to the airplane.  
为什么她不让他了解？他总是让她进入自己的内心，但现在当事情对她来说变得私人化时，她却拒绝透露任何信息。她一整天都表现得焦躁不安，从出发到登上飞机一路上都在对他大喊大叫。

#

"What are you? Stupid!? You need to get your passport!" Asuka had snapped at him, in a frustrated tone.  
“你到底怎么了？蠢吗？！快去拿你的护照！”明日香恼怒地对他吼道。

"Hang on! I'm just getting it out," Shinji had replied as the workers at the airport waited patiently for him to withdraw the document from his pant's pocket.  
"等等！我正把它拿出来，" 真嗣回答道，机场的工作人员耐心等待着他从裤袋里取出文件。

"Oh sure! Take your time, why don't you?" Asuka had groaned, shaking her head and tapping her feet in frustration, "You're taking too long! We're going to miss the plane if you take this up!"  
"哦，当然！慢慢来，为什么不呢？" 明日香叹了口气，摇头跺脚，显得很不耐烦，"你太慢了！再这样下去我们要赶不上飞机了！"

"Miss, you have another hour before your plane starts according to your ticket, so I think you can rest assured you'll arrive on time," the worker had said in an attempt to pacify the German.  
"小姐，根据您的机票，您的航班还有一个小时才开始，所以您可以放心，您会准时到达的，" 工作人员试图安抚这位德国女孩。

"Oh, shut up! What do you know?!"  
"哦，闭嘴！你知道什么？！"

"I work here." "我在这里工作。"

"I have the passport! Here you are," Shinji said, handing the pass to the workers.  
"我有护照！给你，" 真嗣说着，将护照递给了工作人员。

"Oh sure, took you long enough! Dummkopf! What were you doing that whole time? Playing with yourself?"  
"哦当然，你可真慢！笨蛋！你那段时间都在干嘛？自娱自乐吗？"

"Ma'am, that's uncalled for language," one of the coworkers had stammered, shocked by what she was saying.  
""女士，这种话不合适，"" 一位同事结结巴巴地说，对她的话感到震惊。

"Oh shut up! Let's go, you stupid—"  
"哦闭嘴！我们走，你这个蠢——"

"I'm sorry ma'am, but you forgot to show us any identification."  
"对不起，女士，但您忘记向我们出示任何身份证明了。"

"Scheiße! Bumsen Sie Sie und Ihren Paß!"  
"该死！去你的和你的护照！"

After flashing her passport hastily, Shinji had turned to the rest of the workers, and had mumbled, anxiously, "Uh, we're going to see her parents."  
在匆忙展示她的护照后，真嗣转向其他工作人员，紧张地咕哝道：“呃，我们要去见她的父母。”

#

And so, as the plane landed on German turf, Shinji watched Asuka rise from her seat, stretching her back as she snapped, "God damn air planes! These rides are too damn long. Why can't we just get Supersonic jets to bring us here?"  
"于是，当飞机降落在德国的土地上时，真嗣看着明日香从座位上站起来，伸了个懒腰，抱怨道：“该死的飞机！这些航程太他妈长了。为什么我们不能用超音速喷气机直接飞过来？””

"It's probably unhealthy for the baby," Shinji replied.  
“可能对宝宝不好，”真嗣回答。

"Oh, of course, Shinji here is a real protégée when it comes to babies! I don't see you getting pregnant!" Asuka snapped, placing a hand gingerly on the small bump on her torso, a slight convex bubble of life that was currently visible to the human eye. It wasn't large, and, to some, it might just look that Asuka had just put on a little bit of weight. And indeed, she had put on weight aside from the baby. Her arms and thighs had grown slightly thicker, though not enough to look even remotely overweight. It was just a little bit of fat, which was of course expected to form when a woman was pregnant.  
"“哦，当然了，真嗣在这方面可是个真正的天才！我可没见你怀孕！”明日香反唇相讥，小心翼翼地把手放在她腹部微微隆起的小包上，那是一个目前肉眼可见的生命迹象。它并不大，对某些人来说，可能只会觉得明日香稍微胖了点。确实，除了宝宝，她的手臂和大腿也略微变粗了，但还不至于显得肥胖。只是多了些脂肪，当然，这在怀孕的女性身上是预料之中的。”

As the couple walked, Shinji noticed, from the corner of his eyes, his fiancé stumble over a rather obviously placed cart. As she swore on the top of her lungs in German, Shinji wondered just why she hadn't noticed that thing there before. It wasn't out of sight or anything; it was right there. It was almost like walking headlong into a table or a wall. "Damn it," Asuka snapped, "Stupid toes! I knew I shouldn't of warn sandals to this stupid crapshoot of a country!"  
"当这对情侣走着时，真嗣从眼角注意到他的未婚妻绊到了一个相当显眼的推车上。她用德语大声咒骂，真嗣不禁疑惑她之前怎么没注意到那东西。它并不隐蔽，就在那里，几乎像是迎面撞上桌子或墙壁。“该死，”明日香怒道，“蠢脚趾！我就知道不该穿凉鞋来这个该死的国家！””

"Uh, Asuka, you need to relax a little—"  
“呃，明日香，你需要放松一点——”

"You shut up!" “你闭嘴！”

"Yes ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

After reaching the lobby of the airport, they found several people chattering in German. The cacophony was so disorienting that Shinji that he couldn't spot out the man holding a sign with their names on it a mere twenty feet away. His fiancé, irate and frustrated, grabbed him by the wrist, and pulled him toward the man standing their with that sign, clearly longing to be somewhere else, far away.  
到达机场大厅后，他们发现许多人在用德语交谈。嘈杂声如此令人迷失方向，以至于真嗣没有注意到那个拿着写有他们名字的牌子、仅在二十英尺外的人。他的未婚妻既生气又沮丧，抓住他的手腕，把他拉向那个拿着牌子、显然渴望远离此地的人。

"Dummkopf! What are you, stupid? Can't even see the sign when it's right in front of your eyes. You idiot!"  
“笨蛋！你是不是傻？连眼前的牌子都看不见。你这个白痴！”

"I'm sor—hey!" "对不起——嘿！"

"Stupid idiot! Moron! Ugh!"  
"笨蛋！白痴！呸！"

The couple arrived at the side of the German with the sign, who spoke rapidly in harsh, frustrated German. Shinji could pick up on what he was saying rather easily. "How long do you expect me to wait, anyway? Thank God you're here."  
这对夫妇来到了举着牌子的人身边，他用急促而沮丧的德语快速说着。真嗣很容易就能听懂他在说什么。“你到底要我等多久？谢天谢地你们终于来了。”

"I'm sorry," Shinji stammered, in broken German, only for Asuka to shoot him a dirty look. She was training him against saying "sorry" all the time.  
"对不起，" 真嗣结结巴巴地用德语说道，结果只换来明日香一个嫌弃的眼神。她正在训练他不要总是说"对不起"。

Turning to the man, Asuka said, in a snappy tone, "Look, it's your job to hold the sign, right?"  
转向那人，明日香用干脆的语气说道，"听着，举牌子是你的工作，对吧？"

"Right." "对。"

"So why're you complaining? You'll be paid overtime for your services, be able to buy your girlfriend a nice dress, whatever she wants. If you don't have a girl, then you'll just buy one. Knowing someone like you, that's probably the only way you'd get one with you people skills." The man struggled not to yell back as his lips twitched painfully. Shinji gave him credit for strength of will. "Good, now take us to the Langley Estate. Now."  
"那你为什么抱怨呢？你的加班费会有的，还能给你女朋友买件漂亮的裙子，她想要什么就买什么。如果你没有女朋友，那就去买一个。像你这样的人，估计也只有这个办法能找到女朋友了。" 那人努力不让自己吼回去，嘴唇痛苦地抽搐着。真嗣佩服他的意志力。"很好，现在带我们去兰利庄园。立刻。"

"Estate?" Shinji asked, "Are you rich or something?"  
"庄园？" 真嗣问道，"你很有钱吗？"

"Not specifically." "并不是特别有钱。"

"Then why call it an es—"  
"那为什么还叫它‘es—’"

"Right this way," the man groaned.  
"这边请，" 那人呻吟道。

The ride from the airport was relatively long. In fact, Shinji wondered why they couldn't have arrived in an airport at least slightly closer to their destination. The forty-five minute drive was insanely long, especially with Asuka grumpily complaining about everything they saw as they passed by the industrialized cities. "They've cut down all those trees? That's just stupid! I remember there being a forest here, with huge trees! I mean, I remember climbing them and hanging on the branches as a kid. Why did they cut them down? Probably to make way for some stupid freeway or city skyscraper! Those stupid idiots! It's the same in Japan, though, those crazy Japanese stupid—" Shinji sort of just found her complaining to be just white noise after awhile, especially with the driver's radio blasting in the background and planes soaring overhead, cars honking and trucks mowing along, animals crying and humans laughing on the outside.  
从机场出发的路程相当漫长。事实上，真嗣疑惑为什么他们不能选择一个至少离目的地稍近一些的机场。四十五分钟的驾驶时间长得离谱，尤其是明日香一路上对所见的一切都抱怨连连，当他们穿过工业化城市时。“他们把那些树都砍了？真是愚蠢！我记得这里曾有一片森林，有着参天大树！我小时候还爬过它们，挂在树枝上。他们为什么要砍掉？大概是为了给某个愚蠢的高速公路或城市摩天大楼让路！那些蠢货！不过日本也一样，那些疯狂的日本人真是—”真嗣渐渐觉得她的抱怨变成了背景中的白噪音，尤其是司机的收音机在背后轰鸣，飞机在头顶飞过，汽车鸣笛，卡车轰隆驶过，动物哀鸣，外面的人们欢笑。

After an eternity, the car pulled up to a massive driveway that lead up to what looked like a rather large estate, as Asuka had implied. Chances are the house was supplied to the Langley's from the government as a reward for raising a pilot who had fought hard to resist Instrumentality and the Angels. From what Shinji knew, Germany had held the pilots in high esteem. The NERV branch in Germany often received awards, as Fuyutsuki observed constantly. He seemed to envy their success.  
经过漫长的等待，车子终于驶入了一条宽阔的车道，通向一座看起来相当宏伟的庄园，正如明日香所暗示的那样。很可能这栋房子是政府作为奖励提供给 Langley 家的，以表彰他们培养出一位奋力抵抗使徒化和使徒的驾驶员。据真嗣所知，德国对这些驾驶员极为尊敬。德国的 NERV 分部经常获得奖项，这一点经常被冬月观察到。他似乎对他们的成功感到羡慕。

"Well, here we are," the driver said, a note of relief in his voice as he turned around to the couple. "I'll go get your backs."  
“好了，我们到了，”司机说道，声音中带着一丝轻松，他转过身来面对这对情侣。“我去帮你们拿行李。”

"Thank you very much," Shinji replied, waiting for Asuka to say something in response. However, by the time the man left the vehicle, she was still silent. Shinji turned toward his fiancé, and saw her staring out the window at the large building that was her home. It was a true mansion, with turrets and everything, beautiful brick walls constructing the elaborate building, gargoyles and other beautiful ornaments resting on the peeks of the several pointed roofs, decorating the stunning faces of the building. And yet the German didn't seem to notice this at all.  
“非常感谢，”真嗣回答道，等待着明日香回应些什么。然而，直到那人离开车子，她依然沉默不语。真嗣转向他的未婚妻，看到她正凝视着窗外，望着那座作为她家的大宅。那是一座真正的豪宅，有着塔楼和一切，精美的砖墙构建了这座复杂的建筑，石像鬼和其他美丽的装饰品点缀在多个尖顶的顶端，装饰着这座建筑令人惊叹的外观。然而，这位德国女孩似乎完全没有注意到这一切。

Why was Asuka white in the face?  
为什么明日香脸色苍白？

Why was she trembling? 为什么她在颤抖？

Why was she so cold?  
为什么她如此冰冷？

Shinji extended his hand, and pulled the redhead's into his, a concerned expression on his face. It had been years since she had last returned here. The post-Third Impact genocides and wars that broke out here had to be the least of the reasons for her not returning. Something else, something horrible, had happened here, something that happened in the house they were currently parked in front of. The German turned to make eye contact for a moment, a desperate look of longing in her eyes, unable to hide the desire for the Japanese boy to hug her, to hold her close, to tell he everything was going to be better. However, that sense of longing was soon swallowed up in a frustrated scowl, yet her narrowed eyes were unable to hide that melancholy gaze, the longing to be told she didn't need to leave the sanctuary of the vehicle, that she could just remain here for an eternity, away from the unknown fears of the house.  
真嗣伸出手，将红发女孩的手拉入自己的手中，脸上带着关切的表情。自从她上次回到这里已经过去多年。第三次冲击后的种族灭绝和战争爆发，这些都不是她不回来的主要原因。还有别的事情，可怕的事情，发生在这里，就在他们现在停在前面的房子里。德国女孩转过头来，眼神中流露出渴望，无法掩饰她希望日本男孩拥抱她、紧紧抱住她、告诉她一切都会好起来的愿望。然而，这种渴望很快被一个沮丧的皱眉所吞没，尽管她眯起的眼睛无法隐藏那忧郁的目光，那种渴望被告诉她不需要离开车辆的庇护，可以永远留在这里，远离房子未知的恐惧。

"What're you doing?" she spat, in a venomous tone, "Dummkopf! Stop looking at me like that!"  
“你在干什么？”她带着毒辣的语气说道，“笨蛋！别那样看着我！”

"Are you alright?" “你还好吗？”

"Alright? What's wrong with you? Why would it look like I'm not alright, anyway?"  
"没事吧？你哪里不对劲？反正怎么会看起来我不行呢？"

"Well—" "嗯——"

"Are you two going to get out of the car yet?!"  
"你们俩还不打算下车吗？！"

Asuka scowled at the driver, who was currently holding Asuka's entire cornucopia of bags on his back, and holding onto Shinji's single suitcase in his hand. "Jesus! Can't you be a little patient?"  
明日香对司机皱起了眉头，司机此刻正背着明日香那一整袋的行李，手里还提着真嗣的一个手提箱。"天哪！你就不能稍微耐心点吗？"

"Patient? Lady, you're impossible!"  
“有耐心？女士，你简直不可理喻！”

Shinji exited the car, holding the door open for her fiancé to follow. Any ordinary human would probably just leave the hotheaded redhead to her own devices, not really caring if she left the car at all, maybe hoping she didn't. For better or worse, Shinji wasn't an ordinary human being. He could see the pain the German was struggling to conceal. He knew her long enough to know that she was at her bitchiest when she was stressed out. Clearly something was stressing her out to near the breaking point. He knew better than to get in her way, but he also knew that it was best to be as nice as possible to the redhead, to treat her like a Princess in order to remind her that someone did care for her.  
真嗣下了车，为她未婚妻扶着车门。换作普通人，可能会任由那位脾气火爆的红发女子自行其是，并不真正在意她是否下车，甚至可能希望她别下车。但无论好坏，真嗣并非普通人。他能看出那位德国女孩正竭力掩饰的痛苦。他认识她够久了，知道她在压力山大时会变得格外刻薄。显然有什么事让她几乎到了崩溃的边缘。他知道最好不要挡她的路，但他也明白，对这位红发女子尽可能地温柔以待，像对待公主一样对待她，以提醒她有人在乎她，这是最好的办法。

Usually that worked. 通常这招很管用。

He hoped it would now.  
他希望现在会是这样。

Asuka hopped out of the vehicle, her gaze averted from all. She brushed a hand over her forehead, as though she were wiping sweat away. However, seeing as how it was reaching the month of December, and seeing as how Third Impact hard returned the Earth to its pre-Second Impact climate conditions, it was certainly rather chilly outside. However, only Shinji, standing beside the girl, could see the redhead's thumb brush against the corners of her eyes ever so slightly, so that the chauffeur behind them would be unable to see her brush aside the tears she cried.  
明日香从车里跳了出来，目光避开所有人。她用手拂过额头，仿佛在擦汗。然而，既然已经接近十二月，而且第三次冲击已经将地球恢复到第二次冲击前的气候条件，外面的确相当寒冷。不过，只有站在女孩身边的真嗣能看到红发少女的拇指轻轻拂过眼角，这样司机就看不到她擦去泪水了。

Shinji reached out for his fiancé, putting a hand on her shoulder, a reassuring hand that he hoped would relay the message to her, through her layers of pride and fuming frustration, that he was here for her. For a moment, all was still, much to the chauffeur's shock. However, after five seconds, the German girl brushed his hand aside, and mumbled, "I'm fine. Don't worry about me, you stupid idiot." With that, she took several steps closer to the house, her head lowered in resignation.  
真嗣伸手去触碰他的未婚妻，将手放在她的肩上，一只充满安慰的手，他希望这能透过她的层层骄傲和愤怒传递给她，他在这里支持她。有那么一刻，一切都静止了，这让司机大吃一惊。然而，五秒钟后，德国女孩推开了他的手，低声说：“我没事。别担心我，你这个笨蛋。”说完，她向房子走近了几步，头低垂着，显得有些无奈。

"She's your fiancé, right?" the chauffeur mumbled behind Shinji.  
"她是你的未婚妻，对吧？" 司机在真嗣身后咕哝道。

"Yeah, she is." "是的，她是。"

"Uh-huh. If you don't mind me saying so, she's a complete bitch, but she has one sexy ass."  
"嗯哼。恕我直言，她是个十足的婊子，但她有个火辣的屁股。"

Shinji didn't need to defend his fiancé; she happened to turn around on the spot and throw a rock at him. It missed, but the man got the hint rather quickly, and shut his mouth.  
真嗣不需要为他的未婚妻辩护；她恰好原地转身，朝他扔了一块石头。虽然没打中，但那男人很快就明白了意思，闭上了嘴。

"Stupid idiots! I just hate stupid men!"  
“愚蠢的白痴！我就是讨厌愚蠢的男人！”

The trio, the chauffeur trailing behind with the added weight on his back, ascended a large stairway leading up to a pair of large oak doors. This was the threshold of the Langley estate, and now his fiancé was about to reunite with her parents for the first time in perhaps a decade; maybe more. Surely there was only one possible outcome for all this: a lot of problems.  
三人组，司机背着额外的重量跟在后面，登上了一座通往一对巨大橡木门的大楼梯。这里是兰格利庄园的门槛，现在他的未婚妻即将与她的父母重逢，或许是十年来的第一次；甚至更久。毫无疑问，这一切只有一个可能的结果：很多问题。

Asuka wrapped her knuckles against the door, and Shinji held his breath, waiting for the moment where all hell would break lose. Finally, however, the door opened, and, to Shinji's mild surprise, a 14 year old emerged from the depths of the house. The lithe child there before them had long strawberry blonde hair that trailed over her back in the form of two pigtails. Her sky blue eyes gazed up into Asuka's own eyes of the same color, and the two stared at one another for a few moments. Finally, the younger girl smiled. "Sis?"  
明日香用指节敲了敲门，真嗣屏住呼吸，等待着即将爆发的混乱时刻。然而，门终于打开了，让真嗣略感惊讶的是，一个十四岁的女孩从屋子的深处走了出来。站在他们面前的这个纤细的孩子，有着一头长长的草莓金色头发，扎成两条辫子垂在背后。她那湛蓝的眼睛与明日香同样颜色的眼睛对视着，两人凝视彼此片刻。最终，小女孩笑了。“姐姐？”

"Kate? That you?" Asuka asked, nonchalantly in a surprisingly comfortable tone, "You've grown."  
“凯特？是你吗？”明日香以一种出乎意料轻松的语气问道，“你长高了。”

"Uh-huh, and not just my height. My figure's spilled out as well, you know," Kate replied.  
“嗯哼，不只是身高，我的身材也丰满了不少，你知道的。”凯特回答道。

"Yup, that's her sister," Shinji mumbled, positive that Asuka had said something similar to that when he had first met her.  
“嗯，那是她姐姐，”真嗣咕哝着，确信当初第一次见到明日香时，她说过类似的话。

At the sound of Shinji's voice, Kat took a few steps forward, gazing at her future brother-in-law, examining him through narrowed eyes before mumbling, in a lackluster tone, "That's him? The Third Child? He's kinda plain lookin', don't ya think?"  
听到真嗣的声音，凯特向前走了几步，盯着她未来的姐夫，眯起眼睛打量了一番，然后用无精打采的语气咕哝道：“就是他？第三适格者？看起来挺普通的，你不觉得吗？”

"Kate, please, remember that appearances aren't everything when it comes to true romance." At once, Shinji noticed, from the corner of his eye, Asuka jump suddenly and sharply, as though ice had been applied to the back of her neck. She gazed at the woman standing in the doorway, and, as her eyes grew wide, Shinji followed their trail to the woman standing there before them. She was an icy looking blonde, her hair all wrapped up into an elaborate high bun. Her pale skin complemented her green eyes, which was in stark contrast to her daughter's eyes or her step-daughter's. She looked older, like in her late forties or early fifties, and yet was rather beautiful in her aged state. Shinji was sure she was quite a looker even ten years prior, maybe a rival to Asuka. That being said, there was a chill about the woman he just couldn't place, but he knew he didn't like it.  
“凯特，请记住，真正的浪漫并不仅仅关乎外表。” 瞬间，真嗣注意到，从眼角余光中，明日香突然猛地一跳，仿佛脖颈后被冰块触碰一般。她凝视着站在门口的女人，随着她的眼睛睁大，真嗣顺着她的视线望向站在那里的女人。她是一位冷艳的金发女郎，头发高高盘成一个复杂的发髻。她苍白的肌肤与绿色的眼睛相得益彰，与她女儿或继女的眼睛形成鲜明对比。她看起来年长，大约四五十岁，但在她这个年纪依然相当美丽。真嗣确信她十年前也一定是个美人，或许能与明日香匹敌。尽管如此，这位女士身上有一种他无法言明的寒意，但他知道他并不喜欢这种感觉。

Asuka, however, looked like she was beaming. "Hello, mother!"  
然而，明日香看起来却像是容光焕发。“你好，妈妈！”

"My dear step-daughter, I haven't seen you in ages." The mother approached her stepdaughter, and pulled her into a deep embrace. The German girl returned the favor, but only after a second passed after the gesture had been initiated. The hug, though, was surprisingly brief, and the two woman began laughing amongst themselves. "I see you've grown out your hair, and your body has grown into that of an eloquent young lady."  
"亲爱的继女，好久不见了。" 母亲走向她的继女，将她紧紧拥入怀中。德国女孩稍作迟疑，片刻后才回应这个拥抱。然而，这个拥抱出乎意料地短暂，两人随即相视而笑。"看来你留长了头发，身体也长成了一个优雅的年轻女士。"

"Lady? I don't know if I'm that great. I'd figure I'm still a girl physically."  
"女士？我不确定自己是否配得上这个称呼。我觉得在身体上我还是个女孩。"

"You look like a woman ready to be married. And this is my future son-in-law, correct?" Shinji hated when adults used the word "correct" when they could just use "right." "Correct" reminded him of his father.  
"你看起来就像个准备好结婚的女人。这位就是我未来的女婿，对吧？" 真嗣讨厌大人们用"对吧"这个词，他们完全可以直接说"对"。"对吧"总让他想起他的父亲。

"Yeah, that's right," Shinji said, putting a surprising emphasis on the "right."  
"没错，" 真嗣说道，对"没错"这个词意外地加重了语气。

"Well, I'm glad my daughter chose to marry such an important individual such as yourself," Asuka's stepmother said, a smile on her face, "I always knew she was destined for greatness, but to see her now to wed another one of this planet's saviors, I justfeel faint thinking of it. You must tell us everything over dinner tonight. Mr. Langley, as it were, is currently out on business, but should return tomorrow."  
"我很高兴我的女儿选择了像您这样重要的人物结婚，" 明日香的后妈说道，脸上带着微笑，"我一直知道她注定会成就非凡，但看到她现在与另一位地球的救星结婚，我一想到这就感到头晕。今晚晚餐时，您一定要告诉我们所有的事情。拉格纳先生目前因公外出，但预计明天会回来。"

"Oh, that's fine. Don't worry," Asuka replied, smiling, "Might be good for some catching up, right?"  
"哦，那没关系。别担心，" 明日香笑着回答，"也许是个叙旧的好机会，对吧？"

"Correct," Asuka's stepmother replied, "By the way, Shinji, was it?"  
"没错，" 明日香的继母回答道，"顺便问一下，你是真嗣，对吧？"

"That's right." "是的。"

"Well, I would just like to know that if there is anything, and I mean anything, we can do to make your stay at our cozy little estate all the more enjoyable, please, do not hesitate to let us know."  
"那么，我想知道，如果有任何事情——我是说任何事情——我们能做的，来让你的逗留在我们这温馨的小庄园更加愉快，请务必不要犹豫，告诉我们。"

"Alright, I won't," Shinji replied, not trusting that woman for more than a second.  
"好吧，我不会的，" 真嗣回答道，对那个女人连一秒钟的信任都没有。

"Hey, lady, where do you want me to dump your crap?" the chauffeur mumbled under the weight of the bags.  
"嘿，女士，你想让我把你的东西扔哪儿？" 司机在袋子的重压下咕哝着。

Asuka glanced over at him, nonchalantly. "Oh, you? Dump them in wherever I'm staying. Uh, where is that again?"  
明日香瞥了他一眼，漫不经心地说："哦，你？把它们扔到我住的地方。呃，那地方是哪儿来着？"

"Third floor, first room on the right after you walk up the stairs," the stepmother replied, nonchalantly to the chauffeur.  
"三楼，上楼梯后右手边第一间房，"继母漫不经心地对司机说道。

"Thanks a lot," the man, clearly happy to drop the load off, darted toward the doorway.  
"非常感谢，"那男人显然很高兴能卸下这负担，急忙朝门口走去。

"Do you need any help?" Shinji asked the man, but his voice was drowned out by Asuka's voice.  
"需要帮忙吗？"真嗣向那人问道，但他的声音被明日香的声音淹没了。

"Hey guys, can we go get some water please? We're kinda parched," Asuka shouted, overwhelming Shinj's statement so the chauffeur couldn't hear him, couldn't hear his possible means from leaving he alone with her parents, Shinji assumed.  
"嘿，伙计们，我们能去弄点水吗？我们都快渴死了，" 明日香大声喊道，盖过了真嗣的话，司机听不见他的可能的借口，无法听到他可能的借口，让他独自和她父母在一起，真嗣猜测。

"Certainly. Kate will guide you there herself, won't you, Kate?"  
"当然可以。凯特会亲自带你们去，对吧，凯特？"

"Of course! Right this way."  
"当然！这边请。"

"Thanks a lot! Shinji, come with me!" Asuka grabbed Shinji by the wrist and, against his will, dragged him away from the spot, along with her, ensuring that, no matter where she went, he wasn't going anywhere more than five feet away from her in this house.  
“真是太感谢了！真嗣，跟我来！”明日香抓住真嗣的手腕，不顾他的意愿，将他拖离了原地，带着他一起走，确保无论她走到哪里，他都不会在这房子里离她超过五英尺。

This was going to be one long visit, wasn't it?  
这趟拜访会很长，不是吗？

**Part 9 第九部分**

Why the hell was she in Germany, anyway? It wasn't like she actually liked this part of Europe or anything. If anything, she all but hated this place and the memories stored here. She would've enjoyed burning the nation to the ground, if it burned down the memories of that little room and that bed and that damn stinking doll! Asuka stared out her window while that stupid idiot Shinji behind her snoozed on a pink mattress intended for the redhead. He could take the damn bed for all she cared. It wasn't like she even liked pink anyway.  
她到底为什么会跑到德国来？她又不是真的喜欢欧洲的这一部分。说真的，她几乎恨透了这里和这里储存的记忆。如果可以，她倒是很乐意看到这个国家化为灰烬，只要能烧掉那个小房间、那张床和那个该死的臭娃娃的记忆！明日香盯着窗外，而那个愚蠢的白痴真嗣在她身后，正睡在一张原本属于红发女孩的粉色床垫上。他爱睡那张床就让他睡去吧，反正她也不喜欢粉色。

She clenched her fists, angrily, as she pounded the wall. That idiot couldn't stay awake until the damn sun set, could he? He had to be an unsightly loaf on a bed, unable to stand by her side, protect her from awkward conversations, salvage her from the past and all of its horrors. The damn asshole! He was such a jerk for being so inconsiderate! What a jerk! How much she wanted to just punch a hole through him!  
她紧握双拳，愤怒地捶打着墙壁。那个白痴不能等到太阳落山吗？他非得像个难看的懒汉一样躺在床上，无法站在她身边，保护她免受尴尬对话的困扰，无法从过去及其所有恐怖中拯救她。该死的混蛋！他这么不体贴，真是个混蛋！多么混蛋！她真想在他身上打个洞！

She punched the wall again. Oh, who was she trying to fool? It wasn't that idiot she was mad at. She gave him credit for being able to endure two hours of her dragging him into every room she went to without complaining, even the bathroom, just to make sure that he'd be the main subject of conversation, so she wouldn't be alone with her family. She supposed it was inevitable that this would happen. All great things needed to end eventually, didn't they?  
她再次捶打墙壁。哦，她在骗谁呢？她并不是在生那个白痴的气。她承认他能忍受她拖着他进入她去的每一个房间，甚至包括卫生间，而不抱怨，只是为了确保他会成为谈话的主题，这样她就不会独自面对家人。她想这是不可避免的。所有伟大的事情最终都需要结束，不是吗？

"Hey, sis." “嘿，姐姐。”

All good things came to an end.  
所有美好的事物终有尽头。

"Yeah?" Asuka turned to face her younger sister Kate, who was staring at her elder sister with a look of indifference.  
"是吗？" 明日香转向她的妹妹凯特，后者正用一种漠然的表情盯着她的姐姐。

"Mom wanted me to ask you if you could come down for a second."  
"妈妈让我问你能不能下来一下。"

"Not a problem," sighed the redhead, frowning to herself as she gazed out the window for a moment longer. There was no point running away. She needed to face it. Right now, or never at all.  
"没问题，"红发女子叹了口气，皱着眉头，目光在窗外停留了片刻。逃避毫无意义。她需要面对它。就在此刻，否则永远没有机会了。

The two sisters left Shinji asleep on the bed, snoring slightly. As they reached the flight of the stairs, Kate turned around to her sister, pressing her hand against the elder sister's belly. "Say, sis, I think I feel a kick," Kate replied, giggling.  
两姐妹让真嗣在床上继续睡着，轻微地打着呼噜。当她们走到楼梯口时，凯特转身面向姐姐，把手按在姐姐的肚子上。"姐，我觉得我感觉到胎动了，"凯特笑着说。

"It isn't that developed yet. Give it a few months," the redhead sighed, frowning to herself as she asked, slowly, "What did mom want me for, exactly?"  
"还没那么明显呢。再过几个月吧，"红发女子叹息道，皱着眉头，缓缓地问，"妈妈到底找我有什么事？"

Kate shrugged. "Not sure, you know?"  
凯特耸了耸肩。"不太确定，你知道吗？"

"Oh, okay." That didn't sit well with Asuka. The subject matter of their conversation could be one of many topics. For one, it could be about Shinji, which would be perfectly fine. On the other hand, it could be about the baby, which would be a little more awkward. And on the other hand, it could be about her real mother, which, if that were so, she doubted she'd be able to finish a coherent thought.  
"哦，好吧。"这让明日香感到不太舒服。他们谈话的主题可能是多种多样的。比如说，可能是关于真嗣的，那倒没什么问题。另一方面，也可能是关于宝宝的，那就会有点尴尬。再者，可能是关于她亲生母亲的，如果是那样的话，她怀疑自己能否完整地表达出一个连贯的想法。

Her mother was standing in the living room with an old taped up box. It was covered in dust, filled with artifacts that Asuka hadn't seen in years. The icy woman glanced over at the German redhead with a small smile on her lips. "Ah, dearie, I had been meaning to ship this to you, but felt this required the more personal touch. This is a lot of stuff I've been meaning to give you from our house. Lots of old stuff that you'd be able to maybe give to your baby."  
她的母亲站在客厅里，手里拿着一个用胶带封好的旧箱子。箱子上积满了灰尘，里面装着许多明日香多年未见的物品。这位冷冰冰的女人瞥了一眼德国红发的女儿，嘴角露出一丝微笑。"啊，亲爱的，我一直想把这些东西寄给你，但觉得这需要更私人化的方式。这些都是我们家里我一直想给你的东西。很多旧物，也许你可以把它们传给你的宝宝。"

"Oh, so it's mostly baby toys?" Asuka asked.  
"哦，那大多是婴儿玩具吗？" 明日香问道。

"Mostly." "基本上是。"

The redhead approached the array of dust covered toys, glancing at each one with relative indifference. Sure, some of it would be rather nice to give to her daughter—er—child, but a lot of it was rather old. An old plastic doll house sported a rather large crack running down the side. It more resembled the House of Usher than a child's toy, thanks to the thick layers of filth and ash that ensnared the plaything. One tea cup had been crushed under the weight of a plastic toy that was so damaged it was almost impossible to determine just what it had been in its former glory.  
红发女子走近那一排积满灰尘的玩具，相对漠然地扫视着每一个。当然，其中一些给她的女儿——呃——孩子，会相当不错，但很多都相当老旧。一个旧塑料娃娃屋侧面有一道很大的裂缝。由于厚厚的污垢和灰烬覆盖，它更像《厄舍古屋的倒塌》中的房子，而非儿童玩具。一个茶杯被一个塑料玩具压碎了，那玩具损坏严重，几乎无法辨认它昔日的辉煌。

"It's a lot of junk, my dear, but I'm sure some stuff will prove quite useful," her mother replied, hesitantly.  
"这都是些破烂，亲爱的，但我确信有些东西会很有用，"她母亲犹豫地回答道。

"It's a box of crap. I don't remember any of these things," Asuka replied, in a false-sugary tone. After all, she needed to keep up appearances, didn't she? She needed to at least pretend she was happy. If she wasn't pretending, her stepmom would ask why she wasn't happy, and then she'd be forced to listen to a story about her real mother. All at once, she remembered a doll, hanging from a nose, a nightmarish dead, ghoulish body hanging in the air next to it, and the doll her stepmother had given her years ago. She could remember it so well, remember ripping the damn thing to shreds. It was almost as though that bitch was rubbing it in that her real mother was a lunatic.  
"这就是一箱垃圾。我一点也不记得这些东西，"明日香用一种假甜的语气回答。毕竟，她需要维持表面形象，不是吗？她至少得假装自己很开心。如果不假装，她的继母会问她为什么不开心，然后她就得被迫听一个关于她亲生母亲的故事。突然间，她记起一个挂在鼻子上的玩偶，一个噩梦般的死尸，恐怖的身体悬在空中，还有几年前继母给她的那个玩偶。她记得那么清楚，记得把那该死的东西撕成碎片。仿佛那个婊子在故意提醒她，她的亲生母亲是个疯子。

As she returned to the land of the living, she noticed a small amount of fuzzy white cotton stuck to her fingers. As she pulled it away, Kate leaned in closer, curiously. "Hey, what's that on your hands?"  
当她回到现实世界时，她注意到手指上粘着一小撮模糊的白色棉花。当她把它扯下来时，凯特好奇地凑近了。"嘿，你手上那是什么？"

"Not sure," Asuka muttered in response as she removed the last of the cotton, "Looks like cotton, or stuffing."  
"不确定，" 明日香低声回应，同时取下最后一片棉花，"看起来像是棉花，或者是填充物。"

"Stuffing?" "填充物？"

"Yeah, like the stuffing you'd have in a stuffed toy or a—a—" She couldn't say it. If she said that word, the word that began with a "D," then she'd give it strength, she'd make it real, she'd make the pain emerge yet again, pain strong enough to burn her heart and soul, her moral and strength, her resolve and composition, to the ground in a pile of ashes.  
"对，就像填充玩具里的那种填充物，或者——或者——" 她说不出口。如果她说出那个词，那个以"D"开头的词，那么她就会赋予它力量，她就会让它变成现实，她就会再次唤起那股足以将她的心灵和灵魂、她的道德和力量、她的决心和构成，焚烧成灰烬的痛苦。

Her mother glanced at the box, and leaned in toward the box. She reached out for it, groping toward it. "Maybe you can look at the rest later, or—" Asuka grabbed the woman by the wrist, holding her back, holding her arm still, holding her away, holding the nightmarish memories close. Slowly, Asuka released her stepmother, leaving her hands at bay. The redhead turned to the box. She reached inside, tossing toys aside, throwing houses and tea sets aside as she found more stuffing, more of that cotton, stuck to the toys. Finally, at the very bottom of the bin, she saw it.  
她的母亲瞥了一眼那盒子，身子朝它倾斜过去。她伸手去够，摸索着。“也许你可以稍后再看剩下的，或者——”明日香抓住女人的手腕，阻止她，固定她的手臂，让她远离，紧握着那些噩梦般的记忆。慢慢地，明日香松开了她的继母，让她双手远离。红发女孩转向盒子。她伸手进去，把玩具扔到一边，把房子和茶具也扔开，因为她发现了更多的填充物，更多的棉花，粘在玩具上。最后，在箱子的最底部，她看到了它。

A small doll, ripped down the middle.  
一个被从中撕开的小玩偶。

The first gift she had received from her stepmother.  
她从继母那里收到的第一份礼物。

The last doll she had touched following the death of her mother.  
这是她在母亲去世后触摸的最后一个玩偶。

She trembled as she stared at it, reaching out for it with shaky hands. Slowly, her fingers wrapped around the object, her eyes transfixed into its beady black set. She couldn't believe it. How was this possible? It just couldn't be true. Why would this doll be here? Why would it be here? She glanced at her stepmother, her eyes pleading for an explanation for why this doll had to be in a box filled with toys and goodies from the past, why the horrible memories of the past had to be at the bottom of pleasant memories.  
她颤抖着凝视着它，伸出颤抖的手去触碰。慢慢地，她的手指环绕着那个物体，眼睛紧盯着那对黑色的小珠子眼睛。她无法相信。这怎么可能？这不可能是真的。为什么这个玩偶会在这里？为什么它会在这里？她瞥了一眼继母，眼中恳求着解释为什么这个玩偶必须在一个装满过去玩具和好东西的盒子里，为什么可怕的过去记忆必须藏在愉快的记忆之下。

"I don't follow what's happening," Kate mumbled, "It looks like an ugly doll, though."  
“我不明白发生了什么，”凯特喃喃自语，“虽然看起来是个丑陋的玩偶。”

Very slowly, Asuka pulled the doll closer to her chest, holding it to her heart, keeping the memories as close to her as possible. She didn't care what anyone said. She didn't care what anyone said. All that did matter was that she needed this doll. She glanced over at her mother, slowly, as she said, "Can you put all that back in the box please?"  
"非常缓慢地，明日香将那个玩偶紧紧抱在胸前，贴着她的心，尽可能地将那些记忆珍藏在离自己最近的地方。她不在乎别人怎么说。她不在乎别人怎么说。唯一重要的是，她需要这个玩偶。她瞥了一眼母亲，缓缓地说道：“你能把这些都放回盒子里吗？””

"Oh, uh, certainly," her stepmother replied, "Kate, put this stuff back inside, will you?"  
"“哦，呃，当然可以，”她的继母回答道，“凯特，把这些东西放回盒子里，好吗？””

"What? Why do I have to—?"  
"“什么？为什么我得——？””

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

The redhead glanced up at the stairs behind her. There that big idiot Shinji stood, a confused and dopey expression on his face. He was so stupid, standing there, so moronic, so damn annoying. What was he doing there, just staring at her as she held a doll to her chest. What was he doing, anyway? Judging her? Judging what she was doing like some sort of stupid superior judge of some kind. He wasn't perfect. He had problems. She didn't deserve to have that idiot just stare at her like that, like some stupid idiot.  
红发女孩抬头望向身后的楼梯。那个大傻瓜真嗣就站在那里，脸上带着困惑又呆滞的表情。他真是蠢透了，就那样站在那儿，那么愚蠢，那么讨厌。他到底在那儿干什么，只是盯着她把一个娃娃抱在胸前。他到底在干什么？是在评判她吗？像某种愚蠢的高高在上的审判者一样评判她的行为。他并不完美。他也有问题。她不该被那个傻瓜那样盯着，像个愚蠢的白痴一样。

"You dummkopf!" Asuka cried out as the idiot embraced her, his arms comforting her like a warm, soothing blanket, enveloping her in warmth as she cooed to herself, almost silently, but enough to relieve the pressure building in her chest, the pressure to cry out in joy that she had been saved.  
"你这个笨蛋！" 明日香喊道，当那个傻瓜拥抱她时，他的双臂像一条温暖、抚慰的毯子，将她包裹在温暖中，她轻声自语，几乎无声，但足以缓解胸中积压的压力，那股想要欢呼她被拯救的压力。

"I'll go get dinner ready, won't I?" her stepmother mumbled, leaving the room in favor of finishing things at the kitchen.  
"我去准备晚饭，好吗？" 她的继母咕哝着，离开了房间，去厨房完成剩下的工作。

"I don't get it. What's the big deal about a doll?" Kate asked.  
"我不明白。一个玩偶有什么大不了的？" 凯特问道。

"A doll? Is that what set you off?" asked Shinji, curiously.  
"一个玩偶？这就是让你生气的原因吗？" 真嗣好奇地问。

"Yeah, but don't worry. I'm fine," Asuka replied, nonchalantly rubbing her eyes, "It's not like it's a problem or anything."  
"嗯，不过别担心。我没事，" 明日香回答道，漫不经心地揉着眼睛，"又不是什么大问题。"

"Did it remind you of something?" Shinji asked.  
"这让你想起了什么吗？" 真嗣问道。"

"No! Not at all! Just—"  
"没有！一点也没有！只是——"

"Just what?" “什么意思？”

"Stop interrupting! Dummkopf!" She couldn't tell him the truth. She couldn't explain what she really felt, what she had gone through so many years ago when she had first ripped the doll into pieces. "Look, can you do me a favor and put this in my bags?"  
“别打岔了！笨蛋！”她无法告诉他真相。她无法解释自己真正的感受，无法诉说她多年前第一次将那个玩偶撕成碎片时的经历。“听着，你能帮我个忙，把这个放进我的包里吗？”

"Oh, okay." “哦，好的。”

About fifteen minutes later, dinner was served. It was a rather simple meal, with lots of steamed meats and vegetables. She did love the taste, despite the fact that she had to admit to herself Shinji's food was much better. Still, that didn't mean she had to give that idiot another reason to inflate his broken ego. "I missed this great food. You don't get this sort of stuff in Japan. It's all fish and rice there, but this, oh this is just so filling! I mean, you wouldn't believe how much that idiot makes, but it isn't satisfying at all. It leaves you wanting more."  
大约十五分钟后，晚餐端上了桌。这是一顿相当简单的饭菜，有许多蒸肉和蔬菜。尽管她不得不承认，真嗣做的食物要美味得多，但她还是很喜欢这种味道。不过，这并不意味着她需要给那个白痴另一个机会来膨胀他那破碎的自尊。“我怀念这美味的食物。在日本可吃不到这种东西。那里全是鱼和米饭，但这个，哦，这个真是太饱腹了！我是说，你无法相信那个白痴能赚多少，但那根本不满足。它让你总想再来点。”

"Thanks so much for being supportive," mumbled Shinji.  
“非常感谢你的支持，”真嗣咕哝道。

"I'm glad you approve," her stepmother replied, nodding in approval, "Still, we have much to discuss, Asuka."  
“很高兴你满意，”她的继母回答道，点头表示赞同，“不过，我们还有很多事情要谈，明日香。”

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"Well, we need to discuss wedding arrangements, where it's going to take place, and, perhaps most import of all, the baby."  
"嗯，我们需要讨论婚礼的安排，地点，还有，可能最重要的是，宝宝的事。"

"How did you guys ask each other out?" Kate asked, anxiously, staring at the two of them.  
"你们是怎么互相表白的？" 凯特焦急地问，盯着他们俩。

"A little random," Asuka mumbled.  
"有点随意了，" 明日香咕哝道。

"Oh, what?" stammered the surprised Shinji, "How I asked her out?"  
"哦，什么？" 真嗣结巴着，惊讶地问，"我约她出去的方式吗？"

#

"If you want, you can take her home with you now. Her condition has stabilized in the past week or so."  
"如果你想，现在就可以带她回家。她的状况在过去一周左右已经稳定下来了。"

"Thank you so much," Shinji had said, bowing respectfully as the red haired German girl was escorted out of her room, a grim expression on her face. She had been inducted in the asylum for several months now, ever since society had completed its reconstruction. He could only smile now, seeing the German salvaged from her self-imposed shackles. She had driven herself mad, and now she was reaping the benefits of her perseverance.  
"非常感谢你，" 真嗣说道，恭敬地鞠了一躬，那位红发德国女孩被护送出她的房间，脸上带着严肃的表情。她已经被收容在这所精神病院几个月了，自从社会重建完成后。现在他只能微笑，看到这位德国女孩从自我设限的枷锁中被拯救出来。她曾让自己陷入疯狂，而现在她正享受着坚持不懈带来的好处。

She was so beautiful, like an Angel.  
她如此美丽，宛如天使。

Well, not that kind. 嗯，不是那种天使。

"I can walk on my own," Asuka had grumbled toward the nurses assisting her as she had shaken out of their grip. It had been at this moment that Shinji new Asuka had, beyond a shadow of a doubt, recovered. He had been worried, after all. It had been a few months since he watched her thrown into this place for her own safety. She had just snapped so horribly after all she had seen. Shinji couldn't blame her. She had been confronted with so much, forced to endure so much, and she didn't have the liberty of being able to override her pride in order to confide her concerns in someone else.  
"我自己能走，" 明日香对着那些试图扶她的护士们咕哝道，同时挣脱了她们的搀扶。就在这一刻，真嗣确信明日香已经完全康复了。毕竟，他一直很担心。自从他看着她为了安全被送进这个地方已经过去了几个月。她经历了那么多可怕的事情后，情绪崩溃了。真嗣无法责怪她。她面对了太多，承受了太多，而且她没有机会放下自尊去向别人倾诉她的担忧。

"Nice to see you're alright," Shinji had said, hoping to break the silence as he drove her home.  
"很高兴看到你没事，" 真嗣说道，希望能打破沉默，开车送她回家。

"Alright?" Asuka had laughed, but it was a vacant laugh without any true passion to it, "I guess that's one way of putting it."  
"没事？" 明日香笑了，但那笑声空洞，没有真正的热情，"我想这算是一种说法吧。"

Shinji hadn't know exactly how to respond to that one. Such a difficult comment, so cold and indifferent. Casually, he switched tactics. Anything to get her talking. "Where should I drop you off?"  
真嗣并不确切知道该如何回应那句话。如此难以捉摸的评论，既冷酷又漠然。他随意地改变了策略，只为了让她开口说话。“我应该把你送到哪里？”

"Home." “家。”

"Where's home?" Shinji had asked, hoping to prolong discussion.  
“家在哪里？”真嗣问道，希望能延长对话。

"That apartment we shared, remember? You still own it, right?" Asuka had replied.  
"我们曾经同住的那间公寓，记得吗？你还拥有它，对吧？" 明日香回答道。

"Well, yeah. I've been practicing cello constantly while you were gone. I think I've really improved. You gotta hear—"  
"嗯，是的。你不在的时候，我一直不停地练习大提琴。我觉得我真的进步了。你得听听——"

"Did you learn how to play Moonlight Sonata on your cello?"  
"你学会用大提琴演奏《月光奏鸣曲》了吗？"

Shinji considered this. No, he hadn't. He knew exactly what song it was, and maybe he'd be able to try adapting it to work for the cello, but there was one major problem with Moonlight Sonata. "Well, that's usually a piano piece."  
真嗣思考了一下。不，他没有。他确切地知道那首曲子是什么，也许他可以尝试改编它以适应大提琴，但《月光奏鸣曲》有一个主要问题。“嗯，那通常是钢琴曲。”

"Oh. I tried to learn it for my violin. If you want, we could do a duet," Asuka had replied, her voice flat and empty.  
“哦。我曾尝试为我的小提琴学习它。如果你愿意，我们可以合奏一曲，”明日香回答道，她的声音平淡而空洞。

"Something the matter?" “有什么问题吗？”

Asuka was silent. 明日香沉默了。

"Did something happen at the asylum?"  
“精神病院发生了什么事吗？”

Asuka was silent. 明日香沉默了。

"Can you at least talk to me about it?"  
"你至少能跟我谈谈这件事吗？"

Asuka was silent. 明日香沉默了。

"Could you at least—" "你至少能——"

"They played Moonlight Sonata over and over again at that asylum," Asuka replied, flatly, "They played it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. It's enough to drive someone mad."  
"他们在那所精神病院一遍又一遍地播放《月光奏鸣曲》，" 明日香回答道，语气平淡，"他们一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍又一遍地播放。这足以把人逼疯。"

"Oh, uh, well, it's a nice song, you know?"  
"哦，呃，好吧，你知道，这是一首不错的曲子？"

"You know when the played that song, usually this one guy would scream. He must've hated that song, being exposed to it so long. The people there got used to it, but he couldn't. He couldn't adjust. I used to tell him to shut up at first, but then I got to understand why he was in such pain. He hurt that way because he was sick of that song being forced on him. All he needed was someone else."  
"你知道吗，每当播放那首曲子时，通常会有一个人尖叫。他一定讨厌那首歌，长时间被迫听它。那里的人习惯了，但他不行。他无法适应。起初我常叫他闭嘴，但后来我开始理解他为何如此痛苦。他那样痛苦是因为厌倦了被迫听那首歌。他需要的只是另一个人。"

"I'm not sure I follow—"  
"我不太明白你的意思——"

"But he had no one else. No one listened to him because no one understood him, and no one understood him because no one was listening to him, and no one was listening to him because no one—"  
"但他没有其他人了。没人听他说话，因为没人理解他，而没人理解他，因为没人听他说话，没人听他说话，因为没人——"

"Calm down." Shinji put a hand on the redhead's shoulder, frowning gently as he gazed over at her, a serious expression on his face. "I'm here. I'm listening to you."  
"冷静点。" 真嗣把手放在红发女孩的肩上，微微皱眉，认真地看着她，脸上带着严肃的表情。"我在这里。我在听你说。"

"Please don't leave me," she whispered as she held herself in her own arms. "Please don't abandon me. Please don't kill me."  
"请不要离开我，"她低声说着，将自己紧紧抱住。"请不要抛弃我。请不要杀了我。"

Shinji glanced at her, and said, softly, "Okay, I'll never leave you, okay?"  
真嗣瞥了她一眼，轻声说道："好的，我永远不会离开你，好吗？"

#

"Oh, Shinji was being really pathetic and whiney, so I decided to ask him on a date to make him feel better," Asuka grumbled.  
"哦，真嗣表现得真是可怜兮兮的，所以我决定约他出去让他感觉好些，"明日香咕哝着。"

"That's not it at all," Shinji grumbled silently.  
"根本不是那样," 真嗣默默地咕哝着。

"Oh, so what was your story, huh?" Asuka snapped, a sarcastic grin on her lips.  
"哦，那你的故事是什么，嗯？" 明日香厉声说道，嘴角挂着讽刺的笑容。

"Well—" "嗯——"

"What names are you considering for the baby?" Asuka's stepmother asked, curiously.  
"你们考虑给孩子起什么名字？" 明日香的后妈好奇地问。

"We haven't really—" "我们还没真正——"

"Rei if it's a girl," Shinji replied.  
"如果是女孩就叫丽," 真嗣回答道。"

"Wait, what?" Asuka stammered, "There is no way, and I mean no way at all, that we're naming my daughter Rei!"  
"等等，什么？" 明日香结巴道，"绝不可能，我是说绝对不可能，我们不会给我的女儿取名叫丽的！"

"And why not?" Shinji asked, "Rei was such an important part of our lives when we were kids."  
"为什么不呢？" 真嗣问道，"丽在我们小时候是我们生活中非常重要的一部分。"

"Well, let's go down the list, shall we? Number one, she's a damn doll. Number two, she's a clone of your mom. Number three, she's a damn doll!"  
"好吧，让我们逐一列举，好吗？第一，她是个该死的玩偶。第二，她是你的妈妈的克隆体。第三，她是个该死的玩偶！"

"You said that twice." "你说了两次。"

"Just to reinforce my point!"  
"只是为了强调我的观点！"

"What if it's a boy?" Kate asked.  
"如果是男孩怎么办？" 凯特问道。"

"It's not going to be a—"  
"不会是——"

"Kaworu." "薰。"

"Shinji, shut it!" "真嗣，闭嘴！"

**Part 10 第十部分**

The day that Mr. Langley returned home was surprisingly a rather simple and natural moment in Shinji's life. He had never met his fiancé's father before this moment, so when he just popped up outside the house, asking his wife for entrance, it seemed as though Shinji's concerns preceding his inevitable arrival had all been for naught. He had feared that Mr. Langley was a rather intimidating figure, like his own father. Asuka had never mentioned her father before, or at least explicitly, so he just naturally assumed he had been as much as a crappy father as his own.  
兰格利先生回家的那天，对真嗣的生活来说是一个出乎意料简单自然的时刻。他之前从未见过未婚妻的父亲，所以当兰格利先生突然出现在屋外，向妻子请求进入时，真嗣之前对他到来的种种担忧似乎都变得多余了。他曾担心兰格利先生会是一个相当令人畏惧的人物，就像他自己的父亲一样。明日香从未提及过她的父亲，或者至少没有明确说过，所以他自然地认为，兰格利先生和他自己的父亲一样，是个糟糕的父亲。

Upon arrival, Mr. Langley approached his wife, and kissed her directly on the lips. Asuka frowned slightly as at this, but as her father parted from his second wife, Asuka's step mother, he turned to his daughter, and approached her, an apparently warm expression on his face. "Hello there, totcher. It's been far too long since the last time you've graced us with a visit."  
一抵达，兰利先生便走向他的妻子，直接吻在了她的唇上。明日香对此微微皱眉，但当她的父亲与第二任妻子分开后，转向他的女儿，脸上带着明显温暖的表情。“你好啊，小家伙。你已经很久没有赏光来看我们了。”

"Hello, dad," Asuka replied. Shinji couldn't help but find it weird how she addressed this man as "dad." It almost sounded alien coming from her lips. It was, in fact, a little strange, and he had a hard time adjusting to the sound of her saying such words. It was even more startling when she pulled her father into a hug, resting her cheeks against his broad chest.  
“你好，爸爸，”明日香回答道。真嗣不禁觉得她称呼这个人为“爸爸”有些奇怪。这个词从她嘴里说出来几乎显得陌生。事实上，这确实有点奇怪，他很难适应她这样说话的声音。更令人惊讶的是，她拥抱了她的父亲，将脸颊贴在他宽阔的胸膛上。

Her father patted his daughter's shoulders, smiling slightly. "Listen, daughter, we have much to discuss while you're here."  
她的父亲轻拍着女儿的肩膀，微微一笑。“听着，女儿，你在这里的时候我们有很多事情要讨论。”

Asuka parted, slowly. She glanced over at Shinji, and, for an instant, Shinji could see the hints of infinite pain, infinite grief, infinite heartbreak, exposed for only a moment in her pupils. But, then again, maybe it had been a trick of the light, as, after blinking only once, this infinite abyss of emotion seemed to have vanished entirely, a curious glint emanating from her irises as she turned to her large, formidable father. "Oh? What exactly?" she asked, folding her hands behind her back, resting them just below her rear end.  
明日香缓缓分开，她瞥向真嗣，有那么一瞬，真嗣能从她的瞳孔中窥见无尽的痛苦、无尽的悲伤、无尽的心碎，这些情感仅在片刻间暴露无遗。但或许这只是光线的把戏，因为仅仅眨眼一次后，这深不可测的情感深渊似乎完全消失了，取而代之的是她眼中闪烁着好奇的光芒，转向她高大威严的父亲。“哦？具体是什么事？”她问道，双手交叉在背后，正好放在臀部下方。

"About your child, of course," Mr. Langley replied, smiling slightly.  
“当然是关于你的孩子，”兰格利先生回答道，嘴角微微上扬。

Shinji didn't like that smile he wore.  
真嗣不喜欢他脸上挂着的那个微笑。

He didn't know why; he just didn't.  
他不知道为什么；他就是不知道。

"And this must be the famous Third Child," Mr. Langley replied, turning toward Shinji, who had been watching the entire exchange from behind Asuka.  
"这位一定就是著名的三公子了，" 兰利先生回答道，转向了真嗣，后者一直在明日香身后观察着整个对话。

"His name's Shinji," Asuka mumbled.  
"他叫真嗣，" 明日香咕哝道。

"Right! I apologize. He deserves to be called by his first name if you chose him to be your husband," Mr. Langley responded as he extended his hand to Shinji, "You must excuse me; I've heard so much about you from NERV's Germany branch that I feel a certain degree of respect already and we haven't even met yet. I must say, my daughter made a fine choice of a husband."  
"没错！我道歉。如果你选了他做你的丈夫，他理应被称呼为他的名字，" 兰格利先生回应道，同时向真嗣伸出手，"请原谅我；我从 NERV 德国分部听说了太多关于你的事，以至于我对你已经有了一定的敬意，尽管我们还未曾谋面。不得不说，我女儿选了一个出色的丈夫。"

Shinji blushed slightly as he accepted Mr. Langley's hand, bashfully glancing at the ground, at his toes, away from this man's face. "Oh, really, I'm not that special—"  
真嗣微微脸红，接受了兰格利先生的手，羞涩地低头看着地面，脚尖，避开这位先生的目光。"哦，真的，我没那么特别——"

"You salvaged the world from Third Impact's annihilation. You know, some people regard you as a messiah! In Germany, we also remember your efforts to help salvage our nation in the early years of the reconstruction. We are, for all intents and purposes, indebted to you and Asuka's singular efforts. Without you, we wouldn't of returned from the horrors of—"  
"你从第三次冲击的毁灭中拯救了世界。你知道，有些人视你为救世主！在德国，我们也记得你在重建初期对我们国家的帮助。实际上，我们欠你和明日香的努力太多。没有你们，我们无法从那些恐怖中恢复——"

"Stop flattering him," Asuka replied, "It might go to his ego. He is a big idiot, you know. A dummkopf!"  
"别再恭维他了，" 明日香回答，"这可能会助长他的自负。他是个大傻瓜，你知道的。一个笨蛋！"

"Eh, he is going to be the father of my grandkid, so I suppose I could at least compliment him a little bit before I interfere with how he's raised."  
"呃，他将成为我孙子的父亲，所以我想在我干预他的教育方式之前，至少可以稍微夸他几句。"

"I suppose," Shinji replied, blushing still, but still feeling uneasy about looking the man in the eye. He didn't know why he didn't feel comfortable. He usually wasn't this awkward with new people, especially considering his role as a diplomat of sorts for NERV. Still, something about this guy rubbed him the wrong way. He wasn't sure what it was, but it was enough to make him feel a little anxious just by holding his hand. He slowly released it, resisting the urge to wipe his hand against his pants, as Mr. Langley turned toward his daughter Kate, and greeted her accordingly.  
"我想也是，" 真嗣回答，脸依旧红着，但仍然感到不安，不敢直视那人的眼睛。他不知道为什么自己会感到不舒服。他通常不会对新人这么尴尬，尤其是考虑到他作为 NERV 某种外交官的角色。尽管如此，这个人让他感觉不对劲。他不确定是什么，但这足以让他仅仅握手就感到有些焦虑。他慢慢松开手，忍住了用手擦裤子的冲动，因为兰格先生转向他的女儿凯特，并适当地向她打招呼。

As the young girl greeted her father with enthusiasm, perhaps with the intention of receiving admiration, Shinji made eye contact with Asuka. Silently, as though they were speaking with the spasms in their faces and the glints of their eyes, Shinji asked Asuka if there was a reason he felt so awkward around her father, as if there was an explanation for his skin crawling.  
当年轻女孩热情地向父亲打招呼时，或许带着得到赞赏的意图，真嗣与明日香对视了一眼。无声地，仿佛他们通过面部抽搐和眼神闪烁在交流，真嗣询问明日香是否有什么原因让他觉得在她父亲身边如此尴尬，仿佛有一种解释能说明他为何感到皮肤发麻。

She replied with a yes.  
她回答说有。

They once again ate lunch after Mr. Langley's arrival, a rather unappetizing fried dish. Shinji longed to taste rice and fish once more. He hated the taste of this German food. He actually felt he could prepare it better, and even asked at dinner if, for dinner, he could prepare the meal. Mr. Langley laughed. "A husband who does the housework. My daughter did get lucky."  
在兰格利先生到来后，他们再次吃了午餐，是一道相当倒胃口的炸食。真嗣渴望再次品尝米饭和鱼。他讨厌这种德国食物的味道。实际上，他觉得自己能做得更好，甚至在晚餐时询问是否可以由他来准备饭菜。兰格利先生笑了。“做家务的丈夫。我女儿真是幸运。”

"What? You really don't expect me to cook, do you?" Asuka laughed, forcibly. It was a laugh that Asuka usually made whenever she was trying to resist the urge to slam her knuckles into someone's throat. Needless to say, she never laughed that way around Shinji; if she wanted to hit him, she had no damn problem doing so.  
"什么？你真的不指望我做饭吧？" 明日香强笑着说。这是明日香通常在试图抵抗将拳头砸向某人喉咙的冲动时发出的笑声。不用说，她从未在真嗣面前这样笑过；如果她想打他，她可不会有任何问题直接动手。

"I suppose not," Mr. Langley replied with a shrug.  
"我想也是，" 兰格利先生耸耸肩回答道。

"You never were much for domestic chores, Asuka," Mrs. Langley replied.  
"你从来就不擅长家务活，明日香，" 兰格利夫人回答说。

"Remember how when she was little, and we asked her to do the dishes, she'd just refuse?" Mr. Langley replied, "When you wanted to, you could be a most disobedient child."  
"记得她小时候，我们让她洗碗，她总是拒绝吗？" 兰利先生回答说，"当你想做的时候，你可是个非常不听话的孩子。"

"Dad, mom!" Asuka grumbled under her breath, her eyes furious and wide.  
"爸，妈！" 明日香低声抱怨，眼睛愤怒而睁大。

"Then there was that time you shattered all the plates in the house," Mrs. Langley replied.  
"还有那次你把家里所有的盘子都打碎了，" 兰利夫人回答道。

"Oh, so that's who did it?" Kate asked, surprised.  
"哦，原来是他干的？" 凯特惊讶地问。

"Mother—!" "母亲——！"

"What is it, dear?" Asuka's stepmother asked, curiously.  
"怎么了，亲爱的？" 明日香的继母好奇地问。

"Can we please talk about something else?" Asuka snarled through her teeth.  
"我们能不能谈点别的？" 明日香咬牙切齿地说。

"Oh, I see. You're embarrassed about that? Understandable," Mr. Langley said, nonchalantly, "I mean, you did go through a rough time back then."  
"哦，我明白了。你是因为那件事感到尴尬吗？可以理解，" 兰利先生漫不经心地说，"我是说，你那时候确实经历了一段艰难的时期。"

"Rough time?" Shinji asked, confused. What was Mr. Langley talking about? Her mother's separation from her husband? Her death, perhaps? Shinji knew, after all, her mother had been separated from her father and eventually died, but was the separation from the husband death? Asuka had never told him much, but, judging from Asuka's wide eyed, scandalous expression, the memories surging through her head were so painful and dark she didn't want to recall them.  
"艰难的时期？" 真嗣困惑地问。兰利先生指的是什么？她母亲与丈夫的分离？还是她的去世？真嗣知道，毕竟，她母亲与父亲分开了，最终去世了，但分离与死亡是一回事吗？明日香从未向他透露太多，但，从明日香那瞪大眼睛、震惊的表情来看，涌入她脑海的记忆是如此痛苦和黑暗，以至于她不愿回想。

"You mean Asuka had never told you about Kyoto?" Mrs. Langley asked, surprised.  
"你是说，明日香从未跟你提起过京都？" 兰利太太惊讶地问道。

"Kyoto?" Kate asked, curious, "You mean Asuka's real mom?"  
"京都？" 凯特好奇地问，"你是说明日香的亲生母亲？"

"Shut up. Shut up! SHUT UP!" The sound of the redhead's fist against the table silenced all four of them. They stared at her as she rose to her feet, trembling violently as she clenched her fists, her nails almost biting into her soft palms as she glared at her parents, her eyes wide, and yet maybe just a bit teary. "All of you, just shut up!"  
"闭嘴。闭嘴！闭嘴！" 红发女孩的拳头砸在桌上的声音让四人都安静了下来。他们盯着她，只见她站起身来，浑身颤抖，紧握双拳，指甲几乎要嵌入她柔软的掌心，她瞪着父母，眼睛睁得大大的，或许还带着一丝泪光。"你们所有人，都给我闭嘴！"

"Asuka, what's wrong?" Shinji rose from his seat, and reached out for the redhead. He placed a hand on her shoulder, and was thanked for his chivalry with a punch to the jaw! The jab knocked him backward, not drawing blood, but leaving a large red welt. Asuka stared down at him with a look of fury. For an instant, it looked as though the fiery redhead wanted to stomp on him, beat him, kill him, but then realization dawned in her eyes that she had just hit Shinji. Her eyes widened for a moment before she turned on her feet, and sprinted up to her room. The sound of her door slamming filled the entire house, and reverberated in every hall.  
"明日香，怎么了？" 真嗣从座位上站起来，伸手去扶红发少女。他将手搭在她的肩上，却换来一记重拳打在颚部！这一击将他向后击倒，虽未流血，却留下了一片红肿。明日香怒视着他，那一刻，仿佛这火红的少女想要践踏他，殴打他，甚至杀了他，但随即她意识到自己刚刚打了真嗣。她的眼睛瞬间睁大，然后转身飞奔回自己的房间。她关门的声音响彻整个屋子，每个走廊都回荡着这声巨响。

There was a moment of silence.  
一阵沉默。

"She's lost her mind, hasn't she?" Kate asked, simply.  
"她疯了吧，不是吗？" 凯特简单地问道。

Shinji turned to Asuka's family, stroking his chin. "Do you need some ice on that injury?" Mrs. Langley asked, rising from her seat, approaching the refrigerator hastily.  
真嗣转向明日香的家庭，抚摸着下巴。“你需要冰敷一下那个伤口吗？”兰格利夫人问道，从座位上起身，急忙走向冰箱。

"No, I'm fine." “不，我没事。”

"I see. I suppose I'll leave you alone for now. Excuse me." Mrs. Langley left the room, leaving Shinji alone with Mr. Langley, and of course Kate, who hadn't seemed to realize that she was not welcomed in this conversation.  
“我明白了。我想我现在还是不打扰你们了。失陪了。”兰格利夫人离开了房间，留下真嗣独自与兰格利先生，当然还有凯特，她似乎还没意识到自己在这个对话中并不受欢迎。

"I apologize for my daughter's behavior," Mr. Langley replied, "I hope you understand that—"  
"我为女儿的行为道歉，" 兰利先生回答道，"希望你能理解——"

"What happened to her?" Shinji asked, simply.  
"她怎么了？" 真嗣简单地问道。

"Well, she got angry and hit you," Mr. Langley replied, flatly.  
"嗯，她生气了，打了你，" 兰利先生平淡地回答。

"That's not what I meant."  
"那不是我的意思。"

"I thought so," Mr. Langley replied with a sigh, "You mean Kyoto, right?"  
"我也是这么想的，" 兰利先生叹了口气回答，"你是说京都，对吧？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Alright. Kate, leave the room."  
"好了，凯特，离开房间。"

"What? But why?" the blonde pouted, her eyes wide and confused.  
""什么？但为什么？"" 金发女孩噘嘴问道，眼中满是困惑。

"Do as I say. Leave the room. This is a personal matter."  
"照我说的做。离开房间。这是私事。"

Fuming, the blonde rose from her seat, her arms folded over her chest, as she marched out of the room, up the stairs, only to slam the door to her own room shut. Loudly.  
金发女子气愤地从座位上站起身，双臂交叉抱在胸前，大步走出房间，上楼，然后砰地一声用力关上了自己房间的门。声音很大。

She was certainly Asuka's sister.  
她无疑是明日香的姐姐。

Mr. Langley ran his hand on the side of the table as he rose from his seat, walking toward the cabinets. He withdrew a bottle of imported vodka, and poured a small shot for himself. He offered some to Shinji, and he accepted a small puddle of the drink diluted with orange juice. As Mr. Langley took a strong sip from his glass, he said, slowly, "I feel awkward telling you this myself. I thought my daughter would've filled you in."  
兰利先生从座位上站起来，手抚摸着桌边，走向橱柜。他取出一瓶进口伏特加，为自己倒了一小杯。他向真嗣递了一些，真嗣接过一小杯掺了橙汁的酒。兰利先生猛地喝了一口自己的酒，缓缓说道：“我亲自告诉你这件事，感觉很尴尬。我以为我女儿会告诉你的。”

"Well, she didn't." "嗯，她没有。"

"I can see. Well, you see, Kyoto, my first wife, she was part of the first synchronization test involving Evangelion Unit-02. What unfortunately happened was, like with your mother, Yui, there was an accident. The Evangelion happened to swallow a large chunk of her soul into itself, and left Kyoto, how should we say, incomplete. The remains of her that were left in her human form were deeply depressed, and a little, no, very unstable. She ended up developing these psychotic delusions that this doll she had, this tiny raggy little thing, was actually her daughter, Asuka. Every day, she'd call the doll Asuka, refer to it as though it were her own daughter. And every day, our daughter would see her behave in such an odd way. I suppose, in retrospect, I was disturbed by the whole ordeal. I escaped through means that I can't deny I'm not very proud of right now. My daughter saw the worst of me, let's say, and that, piled with the horrible condition her mother was in, left my girl a wreck. It wasn't long after that she was selected to be a pilot. I was told she was extremely happy, and that she ran to see her mother. However, that was also the day her mother hung herself, but not before hanging the doll she believed to be Asuka herself."  
"我能理解。你看，京都，我的第一任妻子，她是参与初号机二号机同步测试的一员。不幸的是，就像你母亲唯一样，发生了一场事故。初号机吞噬了她灵魂的大部分，留下京都，该怎么形容呢，不完整。她留在人形中的残余部分深陷抑郁，而且，不，是非常不稳定。她最终发展出这些精神错乱的幻想，认为她拥有的那个小破布娃娃，实际上是她的女儿，明日香。每天，她都叫那个娃娃明日香，把它当作自己的女儿一样对待。而我们的女儿每天都能看到她这样奇怪的行为。回想起来，我想我当时也被整个事件困扰着。我通过一些现在我并不引以为傲的手段逃脱了。我的女儿看到了我最糟糕的一面，再加上她母亲那糟糕的状况，让我的女孩彻底崩溃了。没过多久，她就被选为驾驶员。我被告知她非常高兴，跑去看望她的母亲。" 然而，那也是她母亲上吊自杀的日子，但在那之前，她挂上了那个她认为是明日香自己的玩偶。"

Shinji stared at Mr. Langley as he swallowed his shot of vodka, quickly. Shinji's hands, however, were trembling too violently for him to even bring the glass to his lips, to even sip on its contents without sloshing it all over his face. All he could see was his fiancé, then a little girl, staring up at the rocking feet of her dead mother, a shadow against the light, creaking back and forth on the boards of the ceiling. What thoughts were going through her mind at the time? What could one possibly think? How could one think? Shinji struggled not to imagine the image of her staring, of her mind breaking to pieces in one swell swoop, her heart not being raped by the pains of horror no child should ever face, of her innocence and safety of mind being demolished in a heartbeat.  
真嗣盯着兰格利先生迅速吞下那杯伏特加。然而，真嗣的双手颤抖得如此剧烈，以至于他甚至无法将杯子举到唇边，无法在不洒满脸的情况下啜饮一口。他眼前浮现的是他的未婚妻，那时还是个小女孩，抬头望着她死去母亲摇晃的双脚，在光影中投下阴影，在天花板的木板上前后摆动。当时她的脑海中在想些什么？一个人可能会怎么想？怎么能思考？真嗣努力不去想象她凝视的画面，她的心智在一瞬间崩溃，她的心灵不被恐怖的痛苦所侵犯，那是任何孩子都不应面对的，她的纯真和心灵的安全在心跳之间被摧毁。

Shinji ran his hands through his hair, his shaky fingers sending tremors through the field of brown. Finally, he found his words. "Now everything makes sense."  
真嗣双手穿过头发，颤抖的手指在棕色发丝间引发一阵阵颤动。终于，他找到了自己的话语。“现在一切都明白了。”

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"The reason why she had been so afraid of coming back to Germany all these years. I thought all this time maybe it was because she didn't like you or maybe that she blamed you for her mother leaving her or dying or what have you, but now it all makes sense. She didn't come back for all this time because she didn't want to remember her mother. It all makes—and that's why she hated Rei, and when she called her a doll—oh God, it all makes sense! And when I suggested we called the baby Rei, she said twice that she wouldn't call it Rei because she was a doll. God, I was reminding her of—and then when—and—and—and—"  
“她这么多年来一直害怕回到德国的原因。我一直以为可能是因为她不喜欢你，或者她怪你因为她母亲离开或去世之类的事情，但现在一切都明白了。她这么多年不回来是因为她不想记起她的母亲。这一切都——这就是为什么她讨厌丽，当她称她为玩偶时——哦天哪，一切都明白了！当我建议我们给婴儿取名丽时，她两次强调不会叫它丽，因为她是玩偶。天哪，我这是在提醒她——然后当——还有——还有——还有——”

"Calm down, Shinji," Mr. Langley replied, putting a hand on Shinji's shoulder. All of a sudden, the man seemed to look a lot less intimidating. Shinji didn't mind looking this man in the eyes. He could see, in a second, that his eyes betrayed a hint of regret, a hint of self loathing, apparently hidden beneath the façade of relaxation. Shinji wondered, momentarily, what Mr. Langley had meant when he said that he had done some things he regretted. However, there wasn't enough time for that right now.  
"冷静点，真嗣，" 兰利先生回答道，一只手放在真嗣的肩膀上。突然间，这个人看起来不再那么令人畏惧了。真嗣不介意直视这个人的眼睛。他一眼就能看出，他的眼神中流露出一丝悔意，一丝自我厌恶，显然隐藏在放松的外表之下。真嗣一时好奇，兰利先生说他做过一些后悔的事情，到底是什么意思。然而，现在没有足够的时间去深究。

"I'd like to make some food for Asuka, but I'm going to need your help to get some of the supplies."  
"我想给明日香做些吃的，但我需要你的帮助来准备一些食材。"

"Of course." "当然可以。"

"I can cook good German food, but I think what she needs right now is to be reminded of Japan a bit. I need you to get—"  
"我能做一手好德国菜，但我觉得她现在需要的是稍微回味一下日本。我需要你去拿——"

#

Shinji wrapped his knuckles against the door to Asuka's room. It had taken several hours preparing everything, but now the scents had filled the air, smells of Germanic and Japanese foods filled every puff of air in the building, the estate. Surely some had drifted into Asuka's room and was tantalizing her nostrils with beautiful scents. However, she needed a personal touch to rouse her from her self-isolation.  
真嗣用指节敲了敲明日香的房门。准备这一切花了好几个小时，但现在空气中弥漫着德式和日式食物的香气，整个建筑、庄园里的每一缕空气都充满了这些味道。肯定有些香气飘进了明日香的房间，用美妙的味道挑逗着她的鼻尖。然而，她需要一个亲身的触动来唤醒她，让她走出自我封闭的状态。

"Uh, Asuka? It's me, Shinji. Dinner's ready."  
"呃，明日香？是我，真嗣。晚饭准备好了。"

"I'm not hungry." "我不饿。"

Shinji sighed. "I made something really good."  
真嗣叹了口气。"我做了些很好吃的东西。"

"I said I'm not hungry. Are you deft?"  
"我说了我现在不饿。你听不懂吗？"

"Listen, if you don't open this door up now, I'm going to knock it down."  
"听着，如果你现在不开门，我就要把它撞开了。"

"You couldn't even if you tried."  
"你就算试了也做不到。"

"You know what? You're probably right."  
"你知道吗？你可能是对的。"

"Of course I am. I always am. Now shut up and leave me alone. I don't want you to see me like this."  
"当然是我。一直都是。现在闭嘴，让我一个人待着。我不想让你看到我这样。"

"Listen, I don't care what you're like right now. I just want you to know that you can come down to eat it whenever you want. We've spent the last few hours making this, and I really hope you'd—"  
"听着，我不在乎你现在什么样。我只是想让你知道，你想什么时候下来吃饭都行。我们花了好几个小时做这个，我真的希望你能——"

"Why'd you waste your time?"  
"你为什么要浪费时间？"

"Come again?" “再说一遍？”

"I hit you. I hurt you. Why are you doing something nice for someone who doesn't deserve your sympathy?"  
"我打了你，我伤害了你。为什么你要对一个不值得你同情的人做这些好事？"

Shinji laughed under his breath. "Do I really need a reason? I'm doing this because I love you."  
真嗣轻声笑了一下。"需要理由吗？我这么做是因为我爱你。"

Slowly, the door opened. Shinji backed away a few paces as Asuka's face became visible. Though her head was hanging low, though her bangs and locks of scarlet covered most of her face, the smeared lines of tears running down her soft cheeks was impossible to overlook. She brushed aside the trails of tears from her face with the back of her hand, clearly praying she had brushed them aside before Shinji could see her momentary weakness. "Dummkopf," she grumbled, leaving her room behind, staring at the ground as she did so, unwilling to meet Shinji's eyes.  
门缓缓地打开了。真嗣后退了几步，只见明日香的面部逐渐显露出来。尽管她的头低垂着，红色的刘海和发丝遮住了大部分脸庞，但那顺着她柔嫩脸颊滑落的泪痕却无法被忽视。她用手背擦去脸上的泪迹，显然是希望在真嗣看到她的脆弱之前将它们抹去。"笨蛋，"她咕哝着，离开了房间，目光始终盯着地面，不愿与真嗣对视。

"Hey, listen, Asuka—" "嘿，听着，明日香——"

"What did that old bastard tell you?" Asuka hissed.  
"那个老混蛋跟你说了什么？" 明日香低声咆哮道。

"What? You mean your father?"  
"什么？你是说你父亲？"

"What did he say?" Asuka repeated, her voice low and dangerous.  
"他说了什么？" 明日香重复道，声音低沉而危险。

There was no way of beating around the bush now. "He, uh, just told me about your—er—your mother and, well, what, uh, happened to, um, her."  
现在没法绕弯子了。"他，呃，刚告诉我关于你——呃——你母亲和，嗯，她发生了，嗯，什么事。"

Asuka leaned her weight against the framework of her bedroom door, her head slumped over. "Look, I don't want to talk about it right now, okay?"  
明日香将身体靠在卧室门的框架上，头低垂着。"听着，我现在不想谈这个，好吗？"

"That's fine," Shinji replied, "We'll talk about it when you're ready. Alone. Okay?"  
“没关系，”真嗣回答，“等你准备好了，我们单独谈谈。好吗？”

Asuka glanced up. Her eyes, despite having completed their sobbing long ago, were still filled with tears. They refused to fall, but rather stayed static in Asuka's eyes. "You stupid idiot! Dummkopf!"  
明日香抬头望去，尽管早已停止哭泣，她的眼中仍盈满泪水。它们不愿落下，只是静静地停留在她的眼眶中。“你这个大笨蛋！傻瓜！”

"I know, I know," Shinji replied, pulling the German woman into a hug, gently stroking her sides and back. He felt slender arms wrap around his middle, pulling him tightly against his fiancé's breasts, her slightly cushioned body, as she nestled her hair against the underside of his jaw, becoming limp in his arms, yet refusing to release her lover, refusing to leave his side for this one moment.  
“我知道，我知道，”真嗣回应着，将这位德国女子拥入怀中，轻抚她的腰侧和背部。他感觉到纤细的手臂环抱住他的腰间，将他紧紧拉向未婚妻的胸前，她那略显柔软的身体，将头发靠在他的下巴下方，全身放松地依偎在他怀里，却仍不愿放开她的爱人，不愿在这一刻离开他的身边。

The feeling would have lasted an eternity had the scents of delicious foods not wafted into Asuka's nostrils. "What's that?" she asked, perking up.  
若非美味食物的香气飘入明日香的鼻中，这种感觉本会持续永恒。“那是什么？”她好奇地问道，精神为之一振。

"I told you I cooked food for you. I thought you said you weren't hungry," Shinji replied, slyly.  
“我告诉过你我为你做了饭。我记得你说你不饿，”真嗣狡黠地回答。

"Oh, shut up! Dummkopf! I'm pregnant for God's sake! I'm not hungry, but she is." Asuka gestured toward her belly, which stuck out ever so slightly.  
“哦，闭嘴！笨蛋！看在上帝的份上，我怀孕了！我不饿，但她饿了。”明日香指了指她微微凸起的腹部。

"You mean he." "你是说他。"

"I mean she!" "我是说她！"

"He."

"She!" "她！"

"He!"

"She!" "她！"

"He!"

"She!" "她！"

"You're arguing like an old married couple," Mr. Langley shouted from the kitchen.  
"你们吵得像对老夫老妻似的，" 兰利先生从厨房喊道。

"Shut up!" the two of them shouted, mutually at the man who had helped make the meal Shinji prepared possible.  
"闭嘴！" 两人同时对着那个帮助完成了真嗣准备饭菜的男人喊道。

Mr. Langley laughed. "How long must I wait here, anyway?"  
兰格利先生笑了。"反正我得在这里等多久？"

"Oh, hang on a second!" Asuka snapped. She turned to Shinji, and smirked, slightly. "Guess we'll settle this debate another time."  
"哦，稍等一下！" 明日香厉声说道。她转向真嗣，微微一笑。"看来我们得改天再解决这场争论了。"

"Alright, sounds good to me."  
“好的，听起来不错。”

The two of them descended the stairway, and Shinji lead Asuka into the kitchen. For a moment, all she could do was stare at the feast presented before them, a series of dishes and plates of all sorts there before them. Hot, steamy rice was pilled up on a rather large, ornate bowl Shinji had found in the back of one of the cabinets (apparently, according to Mr. Langley, it had belonged to Asuka's mother, who was part Japanese herself), mounds of sausages that still sizzled in their serving plates, rows of teriyaki chicken and sushi, fish and miso soup, weinersnitzel and strudle, and other dishes that all looked delicious. The scents wafted through the air, like a cornucopia of deliciousness.  
两人走下楼梯，真嗣领着明日香进了厨房。一时间，她只能盯着眼前丰盛的宴席，各式各样的菜肴和盘子摆在他们面前。热气腾腾的米饭堆在一个相当大且装饰精美的碗里，那是真嗣在橱柜后面找到的（据兰格利先生说，这曾是明日香母亲的，她自己也有日本血统），一堆堆仍在滋滋作响的香肠，一排排照烧鸡和寿司，鱼和味噌汤，维也纳炸肉排和果馅饼，以及其他看起来都十分美味的菜肴。香气在空气中飘荡，宛如美味佳肴的丰饶之角。

Asuka stared at the spread, speechless for a few moments, before replying, with a slight frown, "This is it?"  
明日香盯着这一桌菜，一时无言，随后略带皱眉地问道：“就这些吗？”

"Yeah, sorry," Shinji replied.  
“嗯，抱歉。” 真嗣回答道。

"I thought you'd do better, Shinji," Asuka replied, raising her nose to the air in disapproval, "I mean, really? The food looks undercooked."  
“我还以为你能做得更好呢，真嗣，” 明日香回答道，不满地扬起鼻子，“我是说，真的吗？这食物看起来还没熟透。”

"Asuka," Mrs. Langley mumbled under her breath as the redhead took her seat. Asuka reached out for her eating utensils, only to find, to the left of her plate, a spoon, to the right a fork and knife, and behind the plate a pair of chopsticks.  
“明日香，” 兰格利夫人低声咕哝着，当红发女孩坐下时。明日香伸手去拿餐具，却发现她盘子左边是一个勺子，右边是一副刀叉，而盘子后面则是一双筷子。

"Oh great! Now what do I eat with?" stammered Asuka, eventually choosing the chopsticks, "Only stupid Shinji the dork could make eating even more complicated than it has to be. Thanks a lot!"  
"哦，太好了！现在我用什么吃呢？" 阿斯卡结结巴巴地说，最终选择了筷子，"只有愚蠢的笨蛋真嗣才会让吃饭变得更加复杂。真是谢谢你了！"

"My pleasure," Shinji replied, grinning to himself.  
"乐意效劳，" 真嗣回答道，暗自窃笑。

After helping herself to a massive quantity of food, Asuka sampled each of the foods. She chewed slowly for each bite, as though she were savoring every taste that filled her mouth, dissolved slowly over her taste buds, filling her with a warmth unlike any other. She turned to Shinji, and said, in a high, critical tone, "This stuff tastes like dog food! I'm disappointed, Shinji! Really. It's so disgusting, I can't take another bite!" she added, right before shoving another piece of sausage straight into her open, welcoming jaws. "Unbelievable!"  
阿斯卡自顾自地盛了一大堆食物，逐一品尝。她每一口都细嚼慢咽，仿佛在细细品味每一口食物在口中慢慢溶解，通过味蕾传递给她的温暖感觉，这种感觉与众不同。她转向真嗣，用一种高亢而挑剔的语气说道："这些东西吃起来像狗粮！我真失望，真嗣！真的。太恶心了，我一口都吃不下去了！" 她补充道，紧接着又把一块香肠直接塞进了她张开的大嘴里。"难以置信！"

"I suppose I've failed you, then," Shinji replied, with a sheepish grin.  
"我想我是让你失望了，" 真嗣回答道，脸上带着尴尬的笑容。

"You can bet that much, idiot!" Asuka said before sipping down a spoonful of luscious miso soup, "Really, you need to learn how to cook better."  
"你肯定失败了，笨蛋！" 明日香说着，喝了一口美味的味噌汤，"说真的，你得学学怎么把菜做得更好。"

"I'll try." "我会努力的。"

**Part 11 第十一部分**

"Shinji! Can you get me some chocolate?"  
“真嗣！你能帮我拿些巧克力吗？”

"Chocolate?" The Japanese boy poked his head over from the kitchen to glance at his wife, who was flipping through channels in their familiar little apartment, nonchalantly. Her soft hands rested on her gentle belly, a convex curve now visible, her hands resting on where her now expanded uterus gurgled peacefully, where there was life inside his dear German wife.  
"巧克力？"日本男孩从厨房探出头来，瞥了一眼正在他们熟悉的小公寓里随意切换频道的妻子。她柔软的手轻轻搭在温柔的腹部，如今已可见微微隆起的曲线，她的手放在那正平静咕噜作响的扩张子宫上，那里孕育着生命，属于他亲爱的德国妻子的生命。

Well, "dear" was a bit of an overstatement, and she had yet to truly become his wife.  
嗯，"亲爱的"或许有些夸张，她尚未真正成为他的妻子。

"Yeah, chocolate, I really need some right now, so get it," Asuka mumbled, nonchalantly changing the channel from a mushy romantic movie to what looked like a morbid horror film involving blood soaring in all directions. This seemed to attract her interest, which mildly disturbed Shinji.  
"对，巧克力，我现在真的很需要，快去拿，"明日香咕哝着，随意地将频道从一部缠绵的爱情电影切换到看似血腥恐怖的电影，血花四溅的场景似乎引起了她的兴趣，这让真嗣略感不安。

"You know, you won't be able to watch that once the baby's born," Shinji said, anxiously.  
“你知道吗，宝宝出生后你就不能看那个了，”真嗣焦虑地说。

"Why not? And weren't you supposed to get me chocolate?"  
“为什么不行？而且你不是应该给我买巧克力的吗？”

"Do you really want him watching stuff where someone's eyeball is used as a projectile?" Shinji asked, disapprovingly.  
“你真的想让他看那种用眼珠当投射物的内容吗？”真嗣不赞同地问。

"Chocolate?" Asuka reminded him, her voice dragged out for effect.  
"巧克力？" 明日香提醒他，声音拖长以增加效果。

"Fine, I'll get it," Shinji resigned, glancing over at his wife as she glanced back down at her belly, prodding it gently with her fingers, rolling her shirt up to observe it. It was strange: Asuka was always such a slender, almost overly thin girl, but now with that belly of hers filled with their future child, she looked a little more radiant, perhaps complete. She had always been beautiful, but with that child inside of her, something seemed to invigorate her more.  
"好吧，我去拿，" 真嗣无奈地说，瞥了一眼他的妻子，她正低头看着自己的肚子，用手指轻轻戳着，卷起衬衫观察。这很奇怪：明日香一直是个苗条，几乎过于瘦弱的女孩，但现在她的肚子装着他们未来的孩子，她看起来更加容光焕发，或许更加完整。她一直都很美丽，但有了那个孩子在她体内，似乎有什么东西让她更加充满活力。

Or perhaps what was giving her such energy was the end result of their trip in Germany.  
或许给她带来如此活力的，是他们德国之旅的最终结果。

The trip had ended rather anti-climactically considering the huge episode where Shinji learned of Kyoko's, Asuka's mother, fate. Things seemed to improve. It soon became apparent that the icy vibes Shinji felt coming from Mrs. Langley originated from a terrible first impression. She wasn't a saint, and she certainly was overly proper, but she wasn't an ice queen or a truly wicked stepmother of any sort. If anything, she was fairly friendly. The same was true for Mr. Langley, who seemed, in a subtle way, desperate to reconnect with his daughter, or at least that's what Shinji felt.  
考虑到真嗣得知明日香母亲——绫子命运的那场巨大风波，这次旅行结束得颇为虎头蛇尾。情况似乎有所好转。不久便显而易见，真嗣从绫子夫人身上感受到的冰冷氛围源自于一个糟糕的第一印象。她并非圣人，也确实过于拘谨，但她既非冰山女王，也不是那种真正的恶毒继母。若要说的话，她其实相当友善。绫子先生亦是如此，他似乎在微妙地努力与女儿重建联系，至少真嗣有这样的感觉。

This vibe first came about with that whole dinner thing Shinji cooked up after Asuka snapped. Mr. Langley seemed so determined to help Shinji, so eager to cheer Asuka up, even though she had embarrassed him with her behavior. From that point on, for the rest of the visit, Shinji noticed Mr. Langley treating Asuka with more respect than usual. He would occasionally cook meals, which, Shinji learned from eavesdropping on Kate and Mrs. Langley, was an uncommon event. His food was good, though, if Shinji were to be so proud, not near the caliber of his own cooking. Additionally, Mr. Langley seemed to have a tendency to never say a bad word about his daughter, as though Asuka did nothing wrong, which Shinji could assure the public was not true.  
这种氛围始于真嗣在明日香爆发后策划的那次晚餐。兰格利先生似乎非常决心帮助真嗣，急切地想让明日香开心起来，尽管她的行为让他感到尴尬。从那时起，在剩下的拜访时间里，真嗣注意到兰格利先生对明日香比平时更加尊重。他会偶尔做饭，真嗣从偷听凯特和兰格利夫人的对话中得知，这是不常见的事情。不过，如果真嗣要自豪地说，他的食物很好，虽然远不及他自己的烹饪水平。此外，兰格利先生似乎有一个习惯，从不说他女儿的坏话，好像明日香没有做错任何事，真嗣可以向公众保证这不是真的。

Most important of all, he never mentioned Kyoko again.  
最重要的是，他再也没有提起过 Kyoko。

Ever.

"Here's your chocolate," Shinji replied, handing Asuka a bar.  
“这是你的巧克力，”真嗣回答，递给明日香一条。

Asuka began to unwrap the bar, hastily, a ravenous hunger in her eyes. She shoved the chocolate into her welcoming mouth, and chomped on it, bit down and gnawed as every last crumb disappeared into her grinding jaws in a matter of seconds. Her cheeks were pregnant with the food, unbirthing it as it flowed down her throat, into her body, as opposed to the baby who she would eventually need to expel. Seeing how she ate that bar, it was no wonder she was starting to put on a bit of weight. Rationally, she needed to in order to give birth to a healthy baby boy—uh, baby—and she hadn't gained anything excessive yet, but judging by how her arms and thighs had grown plumper, and how her breasts had swelled slightly, to the point where her bra imprisoned the pillows of flesh within the tight bindings of fabric, to the point where her breasts had taken to rolling around the fabric, she certainly was at a healthy rate, on track. Still, it was impossible to deny she did look different.  
明日香开始匆忙地拆开巧克力棒，眼中闪烁着饥饿的光芒。她将巧克力塞进欢迎的嘴里，大口咀嚼，咬碎并啃食，每一粒碎屑在几秒钟内就被她磨牙吞噬殆尽。她的脸颊因食物而鼓起，随着食物流下喉咙进入身体，这与她最终需要分娩的婴儿形成对比。看她吃那根巧克力棒的样子，难怪她开始有点发胖了。从理性上讲，她需要增重以生下一个健康的宝宝——呃，宝宝——而且她还没有过度增重，但看她手臂和大腿变得更丰满，乳房也略微膨胀，以至于胸罩紧紧束缚着这些肉垫，甚至乳房开始在布料中滚动，她的确处于一个健康的增重速度，一切都在正轨上。尽管如此，她确实看起来不一样了，这是无法否认的。

But God knew if she didn't look like a Goddess now.  
但上帝知道，她现在看起来是否像一位女神。

The phone rang. 电话响了。

"Hello?" Shinji asked, answering the phone, nonchalantly glancing at his fiancé as she longingly gazed at the wrapping, as though a second bar would magically replace the one she had just devoured.  
“喂？” 真嗣接起电话，不经意地瞥了一眼他的未婚妻，她正渴望地盯着包装纸，仿佛第二块巧克力会奇迹般地取代她刚吃掉的那块。

"Hey, Shinji? It's me, Hikari."  
“嘿，真嗣？是我，光。”

"Oh, uh, do you want to speak to—"  
“哦，呃，你想和——”

"Who is it?" Asuka asked, glancing over, "Is it Hikari?"  
“是谁？”明日香问道，目光扫了过来，“是光吗？”

Shinji was about to reply to his fiancé when Hikari hissed in his ear, anxiously, "No! Don't tell her it's me!"  
真嗣正要回答他的未婚妻，光却在耳边急切地低语：“不！别告诉她是我！”

Confused by the request, Shinji, rolling with the punches, replied, tactfully, "It's Fuyutsuki."  
对这一请求感到困惑，真嗣随机应变，巧妙地回答：“是冬月。”

"Really?" Asuka asked, mildly surprised, "Why's he calling you?"  
"真的吗？" 明日香略感惊讶地问，"他为什么给你打电话？"

"Paper work," Shinji replied after a moment's thought.  
"文件工作，" 真嗣沉思片刻后回答道。

"Sounds boring," Asuka mumbled as she returned to her violent show, deciding it might be better to play a few games. Once his fiancé became fully engrossed in whatever it was she was doing, Shinji let out a sigh of relief.  
"听起来很无聊，" 明日香嘟囔着，继续看她的暴力节目，心想或许玩几局游戏会更好。当他的未婚妻完全沉浸在她正在做的事情中时，真嗣松了一口气。

"Smooth recovery," Hikari said into his ear.  
"平稳过渡，" 光在他耳边说道。

Shinji migrated to his own room, closing the door behind him as to block out some of the noise from unwanted ears. He whispered hastily into the phone, "So what's the matter? Is something wrong?"  
真嗣回到自己的房间，关上门以隔绝一些不必要的噪音。他急忙对着电话低声说："那么，有什么事吗？出什么问题了吗？"

"You know what tomorrow is, Shinji?"  
"你知道明天是什么日子吧，真嗣？"

"I'm not—" "我不是——"

"It's Asuka's birthday." "今天是明日香的生日。"

With getting engaged, having a baby, learning about Asuka's mother, and returning home from Germany, Shinji had all but forgotten his wife's date of birth. It was tomorrow, wasn't it? He felt awfully foolish for forgetting. Feeling himself scratch the back of his scalp, he nervously chuckled to Hikari. "You're right. Thank you for reminding me."  
订婚、生子、了解明日香的母亲以及从德国归来，这些事情让真嗣几乎忘记了妻子的生日。不就是明天吗？他为自己的遗忘感到非常愚蠢。他挠了挠后脑勺，紧张地对光笑道：“你说得对。谢谢你提醒我。”

"Listen, I was planning on having a party for her, seeing as how this upcoming year is going to be big and all that, what with the baby and the marriage. Well, the point is I just want you to know if you could distract her for a little bit so we could all get to your apartment, and hide. In your apartment."  
"听着，我本来打算为她办个派对，毕竟接下来这一年意义重大，有宝宝和婚礼什么的。重点是，我只是希望你能帮忙分散她的注意力，这样我们大家就能偷偷溜到你公寓，然后藏起来。在你公寓里。"

"Why my apartment? Isn't your place—"  
"为什么是我公寓？你的地方不是——"

"Would be too suspicious. If Asuka asked you to come here out of the blue, wouldn't you suspect something was up?"  
"那样太可疑了。如果明日香突然叫你来这里，你不会觉得有什么不对劲吗？"

Shinji had to admit Hikari's logic was sound. Awfully sound. "Okay, so what do you suggest I do?"  
真嗣不得不承认，光子的逻辑是合理的。非常合理。“好吧，那你建议我怎么做？”

"Take her on a date, get her a present, do something she'd like, but make sure you leave the door unlocked, or tell me where you'll hide the keys."  
“带她去约会，给她买个礼物，做些她喜欢的事情，但一定要确保门没锁，或者告诉我你会把钥匙藏在哪里。”

"I'll drop off a pair in your mailbox tonight. I'll tell her Fuyutsuki told me to pick something up or something. Or maybe I'll go buy her chocolate."  
“我今晚就把钥匙放在你邮箱里。我会告诉她，副校长让我去取点东西之类的。或者也许我会去买巧克力给她。”

"Chocolate as a birthday present? You know, Shinji, no offense, but that's kinda not enough—"  
"巧克力作为生日礼物？你知道，真嗣，无意冒犯，但这有点不够——"

"No, that's not it: she's been craving chocolate."  
"不，不是那样的：她最近特别想吃巧克力。"

"Oh, so she's getting closer to the Second Trimester, huh?" Those words sounded like Second Impact, or something of equal terror. "Look, don't forget to give us the keys. Also, buy some lotions to reduce stretch marks. It'll help her self-esteem afterwards. Helped me out a lot."  
"哦，这么说她快进入孕中期了，是吧？" 这些话听起来像是第二次冲击，或是同等级别的恐怖事件。"听着，别忘了把钥匙给我们。还有，买点能减少妊娠纹的乳液。这会帮助她之后的自信心。对我帮助很大。"

"What's a good brand?" “什么品牌比较好？”

After Hikari informed her of the proper lotion brands to look for, Shinji hung up the line, frowning slightly. He glanced over at the other room, wondering if the red haired German girl had been eavesdropping or not. Slowly, he reentered the room, only to find his fiancé, to his relieve, ripping out the spinal column of her digitized opponent in her video game. As her avatar on the screen ripped her nemesis to shreds with a violent tearing motion, the German woman punched the air in triumph, cheering her own victory.  
在光告诉她应该寻找哪些合适的乳液品牌后，真嗣挂断了电话，微微皱眉。他瞥了一眼另一个房间，想知道那位红发的德国女孩是否在偷听。他缓缓地重新进入房间，却看到他的未婚妻，让他松了一口气，正在她的电子游戏中撕裂对手的脊椎。当屏幕上的她的角色以一种暴力的撕扯动作将她的敌人撕成碎片时，这位德国女子挥拳庆祝，为自己的胜利欢呼。

It was then that Shinji knew he had nothing to worry about.  
那时，真嗣知道他没有什么可担心的了。

The next day came, and Shinji rose from bed, his fiancé at his side, her hands wrapped around her pregnant belly protectively, as though her body was moving on autopilot even in sleep to protect her young. She really was a beautiful girl. He reached out tentatively with his hand, stroking her soft jawline, running his finger up her smooth skin into her locks of crimson, twirling the straight hair around his finger. She moaned slightly, only to turn over in her sleep, toward Shinji. Slowly, Shinji saw her beautiful sky blue eyes open, groggily glancing over at her fiancé, only to widen with shock.  
次日清晨来临，真嗣从床上起身，他的未婚妻依偎在旁，双手环绕着她怀孕的腹部，保护性地紧抱着，仿佛即使在睡梦中，她的身体也在自动巡航，守护着腹中的孩子。她确实是个美丽的女孩。他小心翼翼地伸出手，轻抚她柔软的下颌线，手指顺着她光滑的肌肤滑入她那如火的红发中，将直发缠绕在指间。她轻声呻吟，随即在睡梦中转身面向真嗣。渐渐地，真嗣看到她那美丽的湛蓝色眼睛缓缓睁开，朦胧地瞥向未婚夫，随即震惊地瞪大了双眼。

"What the hell are you doing, staring at me like that?!" she snapped, rising up sharply to her feet, grabbing her pillow only to bash him on the head with it, "Dummkopf! Pervert! I just be you were feeling me up when I was asleep, huh? Huh!?" His response was muffled under the pillow that she had taken to smother him with. "Well, you know what? I guess I really can't blame your pervvy little mind to admire my beauty. After all, I am the most radiant, amazingly beautiful woman on the face of the—"  
“你到底在干什么，那样盯着我看？！”她厉声喝道，猛地起身，抓起枕头就朝他头上砸去，“笨蛋！变态！我刚才还以为你在趁我睡着时摸我呢，嗯？嗯？！”她的枕头压在他的头上，他的回应被闷在下面。“好吧，你知道吗？我想我确实不能怪你那变态的小脑袋欣赏我的美貌。毕竟，我是这世上最耀眼、最美丽的女人——”

"I can't breathe." “我喘不过气了。”

"Oh, right," Asuka raised the pillow off of his head, allowing his fiancé a few seconds to catch his breath before pushing him off the bed. He tumbled to the ground, which wasn't too far of a fall, but regardless hurt when he slammed against the ground. "Hey, when you get up from there, can you get me some chocolate? I really need some right now."  
"哦，对了，"明日香从他头上举起枕头，让他的未婚夫有几秒钟喘口气，然后把他推下床。他滚落到地上，虽然不算太高，但摔在地上还是有点疼。"嘿，你从那儿起来后，能帮我拿点巧克力吗？我现在真的很需要。"

Shinji was about to retort with some sort of argumentative response along the lines of "You just shoved me off your bed and expect me to be your servant!?" but then he remembered the date, the special occasion it was for this girl at this moment. With a small, resigning grin, he replied, softly, "Alright, guess the Birthday Girl deserves a treat."  
真嗣本想反驳些什么，比如"你刚把我从床上推下来，还指望我当你的仆人吗！？"但随后他记起了今天的日期，对这个女孩来说此刻是多么特别的时刻。他微微一笑，无奈地轻声回答："好吧，看来生日女孩值得一份礼物。"

"Wait, it's my birthday today?" Asuka replied, pausing for a moment.  
"等等，今天是我生日吗？"明日香回答道，停顿了一下。

"You mean you didn't even remember!?" stammered Shinji.  
"你是说你根本不记得了！？" 真嗣结巴着说。

"Well, I guess with all that's been going on, I sorta didn't think about that."  
"嗯，我想是因为最近发生了很多事，我有点没顾上想这个。"

After Shinji gave Asuka a box of chocolates he had picked up the night before, along with some lotion for her belly, (when he had given Toji and Hikari keys to their apartment), he watched in amusement, as a child tossing aside clothing Christmas morning in favor of toys, Asuka tossed aside her rubbing lotion, after acknowledging its uses with a rather disinterested expression, as she dove into the chocolate. With her cheeks full of chocolate, she turned to Shinji, a rather troubled expression on her face. "Hey, do you think I'm starting to look fat?"  
在真嗣送给明日香一盒前一晚挑选的巧克力，以及一些腹部按摩乳液（当时他把公寓钥匙给了剑介和光）之后，他饶有兴致地看着，就像孩子圣诞早晨扔掉衣服去玩玩具一样，明日香在用相当冷漠的表情确认了按摩乳液的用途后，便将其抛诸脑后，一头扎进了巧克力堆里。她嘴里塞满了巧克力，转向真嗣，脸上带着些许困扰的表情。"嘿，你觉得我是不是开始变胖了？"

"Fat?" Shinji glanced down at the redhead, who was resting her hands on her now bulging belly, a belly bulging with life, not with flab. She poked it, gently, feeling the soft flesh coating a protective sphere of life. "I don't think so. I wouldn't worry about it."  
"胖吗？" 真嗣瞥了一眼红发女孩，她正双手放在如今隆起的肚子上，那肚子因生命而隆起，而非赘肉。她轻轻地戳了戳，感受着柔软的肌肤覆盖着保护生命的圆球。"我不这么认为。你不必担心。"

"You're such an idiot sometimes, you know that?" Asuka mumbled, glancing down at her chocolate as she inhaled the rest of it, "I mean, I'm gonna need to gain about 25 lbs from what I read in order to make the child healthy, right? I hear breast feeding kills a lot of calories, right?"  
"你有时候真是傻得可以，知道吗？" 明日香咕哝着，低头看着她的巧克力，一口气把它吃完，"我是说，根据我读到的，为了让孩子健康，我得增重约 25 磅，对吧？我听说母乳喂养会消耗很多热量，对吧？"

"I don't kn—" "我不知—"

"Ah well, at least the lotion will stop those stretch marks, right?"  
"唉，至少那乳液能防止妊娠纹，对吧？"

"I suppose so." She looked miserable. Why was she so sad looking? Was it because of the bulge in her belly where their future son—er, child—was forming? Was it that she felt that bulge made her look ugly, made her look inferior? He sat down beside his wife, tentatively reaching out for her, only for the redhead to rise to her feet, staring down at him with disdain.  
"我想是的。" 她看起来很痛苦。为什么她看起来这么悲伤？是因为她肚子里的隆起，他们未来的儿子——呃，孩子——正在形成吗？还是因为她觉得那个隆起让她看起来丑陋，让她感到自卑？他坐在妻子旁边，试探性地伸出手，却见红发女子站起身来，带着轻蔑的目光俯视着他。

"What're you doing?" she asked, an amused yet sneering grin on her lips.  
"你在干什么？" 她问道，嘴角挂着一丝既好笑又嘲讽的笑容。

"Oh, uh—" "哦，呃——"

"You're trying to play the guy and make me feel all better, tell me eveyrthing's alright, that I look like some sort of angel or something with my fat belly—no, you wouldn't say that—pregnant belly and all that good stuff, right? Well, let me tell you something, Third—wow, haven't called you that in awhile—that's not going to work."  
"你这是在扮演好人，想让我感觉好些，告诉我一切都没事，说我看起来像个天使什么的，挺着个大肚子——不，你不会这么说——怀着孕的肚子和那些好听的话，对吧？好吧，让我告诉你，Third——哇，好久没这么叫你了——这招可不管用。"

She stared at herself in the mirror. She looked mostly the same. Her arms were slightly fluffier, yes, filled with gentle fat, but it was nothing drastic. You really had to look to tell the differences, but, since the German was looking, every subtle change was obvious. Her knuckles and wrists were less noticeable than before, and now, when she stroked her arm, she felt her flesh give under the weight of each fingertip. She stared at herself, naked, as she stroked the moist water droplets off of her skin, the shower behind her now dripping drop after drop, each one rippling on the puddles slowly spiraling down the drain. She cupped her breasts in each hand, which were slightly larger than before, but still were dwarfed by the growth of her uterus, which her stomach had expanded in order to compensate with its growth. Of course, all that chocolate was having an effect too, wasn't it? She ran her hands over her belly, feeling soft flesh that gave under her fingers, just like her arms.  
她凝视镜中的自己。大体上看起来依旧如故。双臂略显丰腴，是的，多了些柔润的脂肪，但变化并不剧烈。必须仔细观察才能察觉差异，然而，既然她在审视，每一处细微的改变都变得显而易见。她的指节和手腕比以前更不显眼了，如今抚摸手臂时，能感受到肌肤在指尖压力下柔软地凹陷。她赤裸着身体，凝视着自己，轻抚去皮肤上的湿润水珠，身后的淋浴间水滴不断，每一滴都在缓缓旋转下陷的水洼中泛起涟漪。她双手托住乳房，它们比以前稍大了一些，但与日益膨胀的子宫相比，仍显得微不足道，她的腹部为了适应这种增长而扩张。当然，那些巧克力也在发挥作用，不是吗？她双手抚过腹部，感受到指下柔软的肌肤，正如她的手臂一样。

She shuddered to herself, aware of how her body was turning against her. Her face was mostly unchanged, but she knew that wouldn't last either. She cringed and trembled as she imagined what she would inevitably look like days before she expelled her daughter—er, child—or worse the days afterwards, where she was still bloated and chunky without the excuse of having a baby within her.  
她不由自主地颤抖，意识到自己的身体正在背叛她。她的脸庞大体未变，但她知道这也不会持续太久。她皱眉发抖，想象着自己不可避免地在分娩前几天的模样——呃，孩子——或者更糟的是，分娩后的那些日子，她依然肿胀笨重，却没有了体内有婴儿的借口。

She clenched her jaw shut in frustration. Why the hell did she get pregnant in the first place? It was an accident, right? A complete mistake of circumstance. She hated the way she looked right now, hated everything about it. Why was she doing this, anyway? She didn't know anything about being a mother. She had, after all, lost hers at a young age. She tried remembering a time before her mother had lost her mind, before she had started babying a stuffed toy in the place of her.  
她紧咬牙关，满心懊恼。她到底为什么会怀孕？这是个意外，对吧？完全是个环境造成的错误。她讨厌自己现在的样子，讨厌这一切。她到底为什么要这么做？她对当母亲一无所知。毕竟，她在年幼时就失去了母亲。她试图回忆母亲失去理智之前的日子，那时母亲还没有开始把一个毛绒玩具当作孩子来溺爱。

One memory sprang to mind, albeit faded like a photograph retrieved from a fire.  
一段记忆浮现脑海，尽管如同从火中抢救出的照片般模糊。

She was a little girl, probably about four or three even, and she was huddling up with her mother, a small smile on her lips, a happy grin as she clung to her hand, her scarlet hair in stark contrast with her mother's flowing locks. Was it just her, or was her mother wearing her hair in a style similar to the style she wore hers now? Perhaps it was just imagination or embellishment. And she was smiling, smiling broadly, but her face was blocked out because of the sun radiating behind her, or perhaps that was an angelic halo? She wasn't sure. They were just walking, not doing anything, but she was there, with her.  
她是个小女孩，大概三四岁左右，正依偎在母亲怀里，唇边挂着浅浅的微笑，幸福地紧握着母亲的手，她那鲜红的头发与母亲飘逸的发丝形成鲜明对比。是她的错觉吗，还是母亲的发型与她现在所梳的相似？或许这只是想象或美化。她笑得灿烂，但脸庞被背后的阳光遮挡，又或许那是天使般的光环？她不确定。她们只是漫步，什么也没做，但她就在那里，与她同在。

Why was that the only good memory she had of her mother?  
为什么这是她唯一美好的母亲记忆？

Why did it bring tears to her eyes?  
为什么这会让她泪流满面？

Why was she crying? 她为何哭泣？

Shinji was cradling a bag of clothing on his back, regretting the decision to take his fiancé to the mall in order to get her out of the house long enough for the others to infiltrate it and hide. He had received a message from Toji telling him that everyone was there, although how many people who were in on it remained to be seen. In fact, he didn't know anything about this ordeal other than what Hikari had told him over the phone. For all he knew, there could be a mob waiting in his house, waiting to overwhelm and kill him, take all his stuff, and force them to watch Barney.  
真嗣背着一袋衣物，后悔带未婚妻去商场以让她离开家足够长时间，好让其他人潜入并藏匿。他收到了飞鸟发来的消息，告知所有人已就位，但具体有多少人参与尚不得而知。实际上，除了电话里光告诉他的那些，他对这次事件一无所知。他甚至不知道家里是否有一群人等着围攻并杀了他，夺走所有财物，逼他们看《巴尼》。

It wasn't likely, but it was possible!  
虽然不太可能，但确实有可能！

"It's only a little more until we get to the car," laughed Asuka, amused by Shinji's trembling knees under the weight of her fifteen bags of stuff, "Don't you love high paying jobs at a government facility? I guess that's a good use of the taxpayer's dollars: giving me clothing."  
"再走一小段路就到车那儿了，" 明日香笑着说，看着真嗣在她的十五袋东西的重压下颤抖的双膝，"你不喜欢在政府机构里拿高薪的工作吗？我想这是纳税人钱的好用途：给我买衣服。"

"We're living in an apartment. How high paying can these jobs possibly be?"  
"我们住的是公寓。这些工作能有多高薪？"

"Oh, stop pointing out the holes in my statement! Well then, shall we head home so I can try wearing all these sexy, beautiful, and oh so expensive birthday presents?"  
"哦，别再挑我话里的毛病了！那么，我们回家吧，这样我就可以试穿所有这些性感、美丽又昂贵的生日礼物了？"

To be fair, the majority of what they had bought was maternity clothing, and Shinji did admit the majority of them were rather beautiful. Still, Shinji imagined his fiancé changing in front of the massive quantity of people now lurking in their apartment, and a smile spread across his lips in amusement.  
平心而论，他们买的大部分是孕妇装，而且真嗣也承认其中大多数确实相当漂亮。不过，真嗣想象着他的未婚妻在众多潜伏在他们公寓里的人面前换衣服，不禁露出了会心的微笑。

"What're you grinning about?" Asuka asked, frowning.  
“你在笑什么？”明日香皱着眉头问道。

"Huh? Oh, nothing at all."  
“嗯？哦，没什么。”

"Weird," Asuka mumbled as she unlocked the car, and hopped into the driver's seat.  
“真奇怪，”明日香一边嘟囔着，一边解锁了车门，跳上了驾驶座。

"Hey, can you unlock the doors?" In response to Shinji's pleas, the trunk popped open, his amused fiancé gesturing toward the back. He hastily dumped all the loads into the back of the car, before waiting for the driver's seat to open up for him.  
“嘿，你能开一下门吗？”面对真嗣的恳求，后备箱突然弹开，他那忍俊不禁的未婚妻示意他往后面看。他急忙将所有东西都塞进车后座，然后等着驾驶座为他腾出位置。

It didn't. 但并没有。

"Hey, can you let me in?" Shinji asked, his voice weary.  
"嘿，能让我进去吗？" 真嗣问道，声音疲惫。

"Hop through the trunk," his fiancé said, clearly amused.  
"从后备箱跳进来，" 他的未婚妻说，显然觉得有趣。

"What!?" "什么！？"

"Can't be too hard with your skinny body. I mean, you don't have a baby or something you need to protect. What if, by opening up your door, I somehow damage the baby?"  
"对你这瘦弱的身体来说，应该不会太难吧。我是说，你又没有宝宝或者什么需要保护的东西。万一我开门的时候不小心伤到宝宝怎么办？"

"C'mon! It's getting cold out here!"  
"快点吧！外面越来越冷了！"

"I'm sorry, it's not like it's my fault or anything. I just don't want to hurt the baby. I'm sure a strong man like yourself can just hop through the trunk to the front seat, after all," Asuka laughed, smiling that semi-cruel semi amused grin of hers.  
"对不起，这又不是我的错。我只是不想伤到宝宝。我相信像你这样强壮的男人，完全可以从后备箱跳到前座，毕竟嘛，" 明日香笑着，露出了她那半是残忍半是戏谑的笑容。"

"Fine," Shinji resigned, hurtling his body into the trunk, his fall cushioned by bags of clothing, before he managed to crawl into the back seat, pulling the trunk door closed with his foot. He rolled on the floor as he tumbled forward.  
“好吧，”真嗣无奈地应道，将自己的身体抛入后备箱，下落时被一堆衣物缓冲，随后他设法爬到后座，用脚拉上后备箱门。他在地板上翻滚着向前摔去。

"You buckled up?" “你系好安全带了吗？”

"Does it look like I'm buckled up?"  
“看起来我像是系了安全带吗？”

After pulling himself into the front seat of his car, or the front passenger seat, and drawing the seatbelt across his chest, the car hurtled forward, back toward their familiar apartment. As they drove, the lights of the night spiraling past them like streaks of wind soaring beside them, Shinji turned toward his fiancé. Although she didn't look any less attractive than usual, there seemed to be something missing, a hollowness, perhaps, that detracted from her glory. He remembered that Hikari was practically glowing during her pregnancy, but Asuka seemed to be more like a black hole, absorbing the glow so that none of it shone from her cheeks.  
他挣扎着爬进车子的前座，或者说前乘客座，系好安全带后，车子猛地向前冲去，返回他们熟悉的公寓。行驶中，夜灯如旋风般掠过，仿佛疾风划过身旁，真嗣转向他的未婚妻。尽管她看起来一如既往地迷人，却似乎少了些什么，一种空洞感，或许，这削弱了她的光彩。他记得光子在怀孕期间几乎容光焕发，但明日香却更像一个黑洞，吸收了所有的光芒，以至于她的脸颊上没有一丝光彩。

"Hey, are you okay?" Shinji asked, glancing over at his bride-to-be.  
“嘿，你还好吗？”真嗣问道，瞥了一眼他的准新娘。

"Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. Why?"  
“嗯？是的，我没事。怎么了？”

"I don't know, you just look a bit off is all."  
"我不知道，你看起来就是有点不对劲。"

"Off? How so?" "不对劲？怎么个不对劲法？"

"I mean, just off. Like you're going to cry."  
"我是说，就是不对劲。好像你要哭了一样。"

She laughed at that comment. "Me? Cry?"  
她对这个评论笑了。“我？哭？”

"You've cried before," Shinji said, defensively.  
“你以前哭过，”真嗣辩解道。

"Yeah, but not that oft—I don't cry, alright?" she snapped, aggressively.  
“是啊，但没那么频繁——我不哭，行了吧？”她咄咄逼人地反驳道。

"Fine, okay, I'm just saying—"  
"好吧，行，我只是说——"

"Just what?" “什么意思？”

"Nothing." "没什么。"

Asuka frowned, slightly. "No, go ahead. What were you going to say?"  
明日香微微皱眉。“不，继续。你刚才想说什么？”

"I was going to say that you just looked really sad lately, you know? You looked as though you had something on your mind lately, and it's just kind of bothering you."  
"我正想说你最近看起来真的很悲伤，你知道吗？你最近看起来心事重重的样子，这让你有点困扰。"

"Well, I have something in my uterus, does that count?"  
"嗯，我子宫里有点东西，这算不算？"

"Is that's what's bothering you? The baby?"  
"这就是困扰你的原因吗？是宝宝吗？"

"Well, yeah, I just think I look like a fatso is all. It's just normal girl stuff, so I wouldn't expect a guy like you to really be too concerned."  
"嗯，是的，我只是觉得自己看起来像个胖子。就是普通女孩子的烦恼，我没想到像你这样的男生会真的在意。"

"But you're pregnant. You shouldn't be worried."  
"但你怀孕了。你不应该担心这些。"

"Oh, it's not a big deal, like I said. Nothing I can't handle on my—"  
"哦，没什么大不了的，就像我说的。这些我自己都能应付——"

"You're beautiful right now."  
"你现在美极了。"

The red haired German stopped midsentence, and glanced over at her husband to be. Her cheeks were flushed with scarlet, and, had it not been for Shinji shouting at her to look back at the road as she almost drove straight into an oncoming bus, Asuka would've remained staring in awe at her husband for hours, her eyes trembling at that unsolicited, unnecessary, and yet welcomed comment. After a few seconds of returning to her senses, the redhead laughed, "That's what they all say."  
红发的德国女孩话说到一半突然停住，转头看向她的未婚夫。她的脸颊因羞涩而泛起绯红，若不是真嗣大声提醒她注意前方道路，差点就迎面撞上一辆公交车，明日香可能会一直凝视着她的丈夫，久久不能自拔，她的眼睛因那突如其来、无关紧要却又令人心动的赞美而颤抖。几秒钟后回过神来，红发女孩笑道：“大家都这么说。”

Finally, they pulled up to their apartment complex. Shinji noticed, with a sinking expression, that, despite the fact that the guests had hidden in their room, they had made no effort to hide the multitude of cars now parked along the street. "Wow, someone must be having a party," Asuka murmured in acknowledgement as they parked in their ordinary spot.  
最终，他们驶入了公寓楼。真嗣注意到，尽管客人们已经躲进了房间，但他们并未设法隐藏沿街停放的众多车辆，这让他表情沉重。“哇，肯定有人在开派对，”明日香轻声附和，当他们停在自己的常规车位时。

"Yeah, someone must be having fun, right?" Shinji laughed, nervously.  
“是啊，肯定有人在享受乐趣，对吧？”真嗣紧张地笑了笑。

The two exited the car, and, as Shinji withdrew the heaping piles of clothing from the trunk, Asuka glanced around, her eyes landing on one car only a few spots away from hers. Her eyebrow raised as she took a few steps closer, her puckered forehead sending a trembling shock up Shinji's spine. "Yeah, hey, wait, isn't that Hikari's—"  
两人下了车，当真嗣从后备箱里取出堆积如山的衣物时，明日香环顾四周，目光落在了离她的车位仅几步之遥的一辆车上。她眉头一挑，走近几步，紧皱的额头让真嗣的脊背一阵发麻。“嘿，等等，那不是光的车吗——”

"Hey, Asuka, help me carry some of these bags, alright?" Shinji dumped some of the fifteen bags into Asuka's arms, knocking her off balance for a moment. She caught herself, but her view of the car was obscured.  
“嘿，明日香，帮我拿几个包，好吗？”真嗣将十五个包中的几个塞进明日香怀里，让她一时失去了平衡。她稳住了自己，但视线却被遮挡住了。

"Hey! I asked you to carry them for me!"  
"嘿！我让你帮我拿的！"

"I know, but my arms are getting tired."  
"我知道，但我的胳膊快累断了。"

"You don't have the privilege of getting tired!" Asuka shouted back as Shinji darted up the stairs. The redhead followed the Japanese adult, albeit at a slower speed due to the mass in her belly. She seemed to have all but forgotten the car as they made their way, almost playfully, to their room. Shinji placed his keys in the lock, slowly unlocking the door as to give the guests inside warning that they had arrived. As Asuka reached the landing before the door, she mumbled, aggressively, "How long you gonna unlock the door?"  
"你可没资格喊累！"" 明日香回喊道，真嗣则快步上楼。红发女孩跟在后面，尽管因为肚子里的重量速度慢了些。她似乎完全忘记了车子，两人几乎是嬉闹着走向房间。真嗣把钥匙插进锁孔，慢慢转动，以此给屋内的客人一个他们到来的信号。当明日香走到门前时，她不满地嘟囔道：""你还要开多久门啊？"

"Oh, just a minute," Shinji replied, shoving against the door as it hurtled open, the room dark and empty.  
"哦，稍等一下，" 真嗣回答道，用力推开疾速敞开的门，房间内一片漆黑，空无一人。

"Did we forget to turn on the lights when we left?" Asuka asked, surprised, "I thought I kept a lamp on or something." Asuka walked into the room, only for the lights to suddenly turn on, and they were greeted to a rather festive sight.  
"我们离开时忘记开灯了吗？" 明日香惊讶地问，"我记得我留了一盏灯或者什么的。" 明日香走进房间，突然间灯光亮起，映入眼帘的是一片相当喜庆的景象。

**Part 12 第十二部分**

"Mr. Shinji Ikari! Will Mr. Shinji Ikari please come to Commander Kozu Fuyutsuki's office?"  
碇真嗣先生！碇真嗣先生请到葛城美里指挥官的办公室来一下好吗？

That familiar female voice rang through the loudspeaker of the building. He probably had called his office to no response a dozen times earlier to get this desperate to contact Shinji. However, it was rather difficult to answer the phone when one was ejecting explosive levels of diarrhea from one's anus. Shinji recalled last night with a rather irate expression as he felt helpless frustration at being unable to respond to Fuyutsuki's call.  
那熟悉的女性声音通过大楼的扬声器回荡开来。他之前可能已经给办公室打了十几次电话却无人应答，以至于现在如此迫切地想要联系真嗣。然而，当一个人正从肛门喷射出爆炸性的腹泻时，接电话确实相当困难。真嗣回想起昨晚，脸上带着相当恼怒的表情，感到无助的沮丧，因为他无法回应冬月老师的电话。

Last night, Misato had dumped both of her kids on both him and his darling wife-to-be, Asuka. To say this was unexpected would be akin to claiming that Stalingrad was only a minor battle. Once again, thankfully, Ryouji had become a boy possessed by the urge to dominate and destroy Asuka in a fighting game of some sort, Shinji figured the newest Mortal Kombat seeing as how that was what his wife had spent the majority of the time playing recently. Unfortunately, however, Yumi wasn't so easily preoccupied with the game.  
昨晚，美里把她的两个孩子都丢给了他和他的未婚妻——亲爱的明日香。说这是意料之外的事，简直就像声称斯大林格勒只是一场小规模战斗一样。幸运的是，再一次地，绫志被某种想要在某种格斗游戏中支配并摧毁明日香的冲动所驱使，真嗣猜测是最近的《真人快打》，因为那是他妻子最近大部分时间都在玩的游戏。然而，不幸的是，由美并没有那么容易被游戏吸引。

Rather, she was drawing. 相反，她在画画。

While in and of itself this was an act of no real importance, and certainly one that wouldn't cause Shinji to release toxic brown sludge out of his ass, it was the content of the drawings that lead to both final situations. It was a certain blue haired girl: Rei Ayanami.  
虽然这件事本身并不重要，也绝不会让真嗣因此放出有毒的棕色泥浆，但正是这些画的内容导致了最终的局面。那是一个蓝发女孩：绫波零。

Just how the hell did this girl know about Rei Ayanami remained a mystery to Shinji to this very instant. How did Yumi know about a girl who had fallen to pieces years before she had even drawn her first breath? Out of all the individuals who had never returned from Instrumentality, Rei Ayanami was the one no one had ever spoken of in public, or had built a memorial of. Ryouji Kaji and Ritsuko had both memorials and portraits of all sorts positioned all around the NERV facilities, and Gendo Ikari's horrible form had been erected as a statue in front of the entranceway Shinji took every day to work, but Rei Ayanami's sole monument, the sole evidence she had even been alive at all, save for simple pictures and documentation, was her Earthly remains that had been contained several miles below the Earth.  
这个女孩究竟是如何知道绫波零的，至今对真嗣来说仍是个谜。优美是如何知道一个在他出生前几年就已支离破碎的女孩的？在所有未从人类补完计划中归来的人中，绫波零是唯一一个从未有人在公开场合提及，也未曾为她建立纪念碑的。加持良治和律子都有各种形式的纪念碑和肖像遍布 NERV 设施各处，而碇源堂那可怕的形象则被塑成雕像，矗立在真嗣每天上班必经的入口处，但绫波零唯一的纪念，唯一证明她曾活过的证据，除了简单的照片和文件外，就是她被深埋地下的遗骸。

Rei Ayanami was in pieces below the Earth.  
绫波零的遗骸深埋于地底。

How did Yumi know what she looked like?  
优米是怎么知道她长什么样的？

Why was she drawing he so frequently?  
为什么她这么频繁地画他？

"So, Yumi, drawing again?" Shinji asked, softly so he wouldn't draw his fiance's attention to the subject that disturbed her so terribly.  
“那么，优米，又在画画吗？”真嗣轻声问道，以免引起他未婚妻对那个令她如此困扰的话题的注意。

Yumi nodded at this, her eyes still focused behind her glasses in nigh-obsessive attention. "It's that girl I told you about last time, R—" Shinji clamped a hand on Yumi's soft mouth, strangling the words before they could be given life. Thankfully, Asuka was too busy dampening her character's fists in Ryouji's avatar's blood to even briefly notice the first letter of her hated rival's name.  
优点头回应，她的目光依旧透过眼镜专注地凝视着，近乎痴迷。“就是我上次跟你说的那个女孩，R——”真嗣一手捂住优柔软的嘴唇，将那些话扼杀在萌芽之中。幸运的是，明日香正忙着在她角色的拳头上沾满 Ryouji 化身的鲜血，根本无暇注意到她憎恨的对手名字的首字母。

"I know who you mean, yeah. So, uh, Yumi, did you see this girl again?"  
“我知道你说的是谁，嗯。那么，优，你又见到那个女孩了吗？”

"Yeah," Yumi replied, "Outside my house."  
“嗯，”优回答，“在我家外面。”

"Outside your—what was that!" Outside Misato Katsuragi—er—Hyuuga's house? How could a dead woman Misato had known for years possibly find herself in front of the house of one of the people this supposedly dead or alive girl knew growing up and dying in front of? Wasn't there security around the Hyuuga residence that would pick up the presence of a living dead girl like Rei Ayanami? Wasn't there some sort of scanner or tracker that would determine if an Angelic creature like Rei emerged nearby?  
"你在外面——那是什么！" 在葛城美里——呃——日向的家外面？一个死了的女人，美里认识多年的人，怎么可能突然出现在她所认识并成长的地方，甚至死在门前？日向家周围难道没有安保系统能察觉到像绫波丽这样的活死人的存在吗？难道没有某种扫描仪或追踪器能检测到像绫波丽这样的天使生物出现在附近吗？

"Yeah, on the front step," Yumi replied, "Just standing there. Mommy didn't see her, though, 'cause she left before she came outside."  
"是的，就在前台阶上，" 由美回答道，"就站在那里。妈妈没看到她，因为她出去之前那女孩已经在外面了。"

Misato didn't see? Surely security cameras caught something. Shinji knew that someone like Rei Ayanami couldn't just walk up, say hi, and leave without someone noticing her. Actually, that statement wasn't entirely true, now that he thought of it, considering just how spectral Rei was in life. But Yumi couldn't notice that Shinji was this anxious, oh no. "Oh, did she say anything to you?"  
美里没看到？安全摄像头肯定捕捉到了什么。真嗣知道像绫波丽这样的人不可能就这样走过来，打个招呼，然后离开而不被人注意到。实际上，考虑到绫波丽生前那种幽灵般的特质，这句话并不完全正确。但由美不会注意到真嗣的这种焦虑，哦不。 "哦，她对你说了什么吗？"

"She asked about someone named Pilot Sohryu. Do you know someone like that?"  
"她问起一个叫 Sohryu Pilot 的人。你认识这样的人吗？"

THAT caught his fiancé's attention.  
这引起了他的未婚妻的注意。

At that moment, the redhaired German rose to her feet, and turned around, curiously. It was as though, even after over a decade of disuse, that name still summoned feelings of the past from his wife-to-be, bringing the former ace pilot to her feet, just like that. "What're you two talking about, exactly?"  
就在那一刻，那位红发的德国女子站起身来，好奇地转过身。仿佛即使过了十几年未曾使用，那个名字依然能从他的未婚妻心中唤起往昔的情感，让她这位前王牌飞行员就这样站了起来。“你们俩到底在谈些什么？”

"Oh, uh, nothing at all!" Shinji replied, waving Yumi off before she could speak something that would compromise his cover-up. After all, he was doing this for Asuka's sake. He didn't want Asuka responding like last time by going all nuts searching for info on Rei Ayanami again. Surely his wife could forgive him for so clearly lying to her like this.  
"哦，呃，没什么！" 真嗣回答道，赶在由美说出可能揭穿他掩饰的话之前挥手让她别说了。毕竟，他这么做是为了明日香。他不想明日香像上次那样，又发疯似的去搜寻绫波零的信息。毫无疑问，他的妻子会原谅他如此明显地对她撒谎。

"No, really, I heard my name. I'm not stupid, like you, idiot."  
"不，真的，我听到我的名字了。我可不像你那么蠢，白痴。"

Yumi jumped up at this, her eyes wide like balls. "You were a pilot? Of what, a plane?"  
由美听到这话跳了起来，眼睛瞪得像球一样大。"你曾经是飞行员？什么飞机？"

"Well, no, not really. Actually, I was the pilot of—"  
"嗯，不，其实不算。实际上，我是——"

"So who wants some German food?" It was the first thing Shinji could think of that would deviate the topic away from piloting, from Yumi's questions, from Rei Ayanami. As he hastily grabbed random ingredients together, along with a fryer, he noticed that Asuka was STILL explaining to Yumi the exact nature of who "Pilot Sohryu" was.  
"那么谁想来点德国菜？" 这是真嗣能想到的第一个能将话题从驾驶、从优美的提问、从绫波零身上引开的东西。他匆忙地抓起一些随机的食材，连同炸锅一起，注意到明日香仍在向优美详细解释“惣流驾驶员”究竟是谁。

"Oh, yeah, I'll have some of whatever you make, just get me chocolate too. Anyway, back when I was younger, I—"  
"哦，好的，你做什么我都吃，再给我来点巧克力。话说回来，我小时候——"

At that moment, the pots and pans Shinji had retrieved "slipped" from his fingers, slamming loudly onto the oven, sending a clatter through the air that obliterated the sounds that emerged from the redhead's mouth. The girl cringed, the soft flesh on her shoulders bunching up over her bra-straps, but Shinji didn't care. Anything to interrupt Asuka before Rei's story came to the forefront of the conversation.  
就在那一刻，真嗣拿的锅碗瓢盆从他手中“滑落”，重重地砸在烤箱上，发出一阵刺耳的碰撞声，淹没了红发女孩口中的声音。女孩缩了缩身子，肩上的软肉在胸罩带上方聚成一团，但真嗣并不在意。只要能在丽的故事成为话题焦点之前打断明日香，他什么都愿意做。

"What the hell are you! Stupid!" Asuka snapped, turning on Shinji, "Those pots aren't cheap, ya know!"  
“你到底在搞什么鬼！蠢货！”明日香厉声喝道，转向真嗣，“那些锅可不便宜，你知道吗！”

"But you see no problem in spending dozens of hundreds if not thousands of dollars on a birthday cornucopia?"  
“但你却觉得花上几百甚至几千美元办个生日宴会毫无问题？”

"That's irrelevant!" "那无关紧要！"

"You guys sure fight a lot," Yumi replied, smiling, her dimples almost begging Shinji to pinch her cherubic cheeks.  
""你们俩真是吵个不停，"" 优微笑着说，她的酒窝几乎在恳求真嗣捏捏她那可爱的脸颊。

"Yeah, well, that's what happens when you're dealing with an idiot like him," Asuka replied, slumping back down by Ryouji, forgetting Yumi in order to pummel her brother.  
""是啊，这就是跟像他那样的白痴打交道的后果，"" 明日香回答道，又瘫倒在亮司旁边，忘记了优的存在，转而继续揍她的哥哥。

Disaster averted, right? 灾难避免了，对吧？

As Shinji realized, as he sat on the can, an extra ingediant had been dropped in the pot when he slammed it against the oven, one that, upon being cooked, reacted poorly with his bowels. Asuka and the others simply said the food wasn't his best specimen, or, in Asuka's words, "I've tasted freaking dog vomit tastier than this slop! What? Was edible food too classy for tonight, dummkopf?"  
正如真嗣所意识到的那样，当他坐在马桶上时，他在猛击锅子时意外地向锅中加入了某种额外的成分，这种成分在被烹饪后与他的肠胃产生了不良反应。明日香和其他人只是说这顿饭不是他最好的作品，或者说，用明日香的话来说，“我尝过比这烂泥还美味的狗呕吐物！怎么？今晚吃可食用的食物对你来说太高级了吗，笨蛋？”

After purging himself of the filthy sludge he had cooked the night before, Shinji left the bathroom, and made a mad dash for Fuyutsuki's room as they paged him a second time. Upon arriving in his office, pushing his door open as he stumbled in front of Fuyutsuki's desk in a clutter, the elderly man glanced at him, sighing in relief. "Good. For a second I thought you must've been out contemplating the meaning of life or something. What took you so long, Ikari?"  
在清除了昨晚烹饪的污秽泥浆后，真嗣离开了浴室，疯狂地冲向冬月副司令的房间，因为他第二次被呼叫了。到达办公室时，他推开门，踉跄地站在冬月的办公桌前，这位老人看了他一眼，松了口气。“好。有那么一会儿，我还以为你一定是在外面思考人生的意义之类的。碇，你为什么花了这么长时间？”

"I was, er, taking care of some business, sir."  
"呃，先生，我正在处理一些事务。"

"Was it so important that you couldn't just stop what you were doing and walk your way to my office, Ikari?"  
"真的有那么重要，以至于你不能停下手头的事情，直接走到我办公室来吗，碇？"

"Trust me when I say that if I stopped midway and did a half-assed job, things could get a little messy in here."  
"相信我，如果我中途停下来，只做一半的工作，这里可能会变得有点乱。"

"Ikari, I waddle through messes bigger than whatever you were dealing with on a daily basis, so that's no excuse."  
"碇，我蹚过的浑水比你日常处理的那些要大得多，所以这不算借口。"

"Okay, sir." "好的，先生。"

"And in any case, what I have to tell you is extremely important, so listen very careful to what I am about to say."  
"无论如何，我要告诉你的事极其重要，所以请仔细听我接下来要说的话。"

"Okay." “好的。”

Fuyutsuki ran a hand up his wrinkled forehead, the lighting in the room making him look older than he truly was. Finally, he turned to Shinji, and withdrew a folder from his desk drawer. As he dropped the file on the surface of his desk, he began to speak. "Intelligence gathered questionable video content from the Hyuuga residence a few days ago, but it's only come to my attention recently due to rather sloppy middle management skills. Once Misato saw this, she felt you had the right to take a look at all this as well."  
冬月用手抚过他布满皱纹的额头，房间的灯光让他看起来比实际年龄更老。最终，他转向真嗣，从办公桌抽屉里取出一个文件夹。他将文件丢在桌面上，开始说道：“几天前，情报部门从日向家收集到了一些可疑的视频内容，但由于中层管理不善，直到最近才引起我的注意。米萨托看到这些后，认为你也有权看一下。”

Even before Fuyutsuki opened the folder up, Shinji knew what he was about to see. He didn't need the page to turn to bare witness to a head of blue hair, scarlet eyes staring out at the camera, a school uniform composed of blue and white fabric that he had not seen in several yeas, and pale, empty skin pulled against nigh emotionless facial muscles.  
甚至在冬月打开文件夹之前，真嗣就知道自己即将看到什么。他不需要翻页就能见证那一头蓝发，猩红的眼睛直视着镜头，那套由蓝白布料组成的校服他已经多年未见，苍白无情的肌肤紧贴在几乎毫无表情的脸庞上。

Rei Ayanami. 绫波零。

Alive again. 再次活过来。

"I don't know what this means, nor have I any way of knowing how to deal with this issue, but, Ikari, we just felt you should know. That's all."  
“我不明白这意味着什么，也没有任何方法知道如何处理这个问题，但，碇，我们只是觉得你应该知道。仅此而已。”

"I understand, Commander. But, can you tell me what you think this means?"  
"我明白，指挥官。但，你能告诉我你认为这意味着什么吗？"

Fuyutsuki sighed, running his hand through his hair yet again, pewter in color. "I have no idea. I really wish I had an answer to satisfy you, but I've got nothing. We checked the basement, and there's no sign that Rei's remains are any different, the bloodstains she left on the moon are still present, but I have nothing I can possibly tell you to explain why Rei Ayanami is in that picture. Not a damn thing."  
冬月叹了口气，再次用手梳理着他那铅灰色的头发。“我不知道。我真的希望能给你一个满意的答案，但我什么都没有。我们检查了地下室，那里没有任何迹象表明绫波的遗体有所不同，她在月球上留下的血迹依然存在，但我无法告诉你为什么绫波零会出现在那张照片里。一点线索都没有。”

"Does—" "这——"

"Your fiancé knows nothing. We all felt, considering their history and the great lengths she went to last time to prove to herself that there was nothing wrong, that for her peace of mind it was best not to tell her until we have sure proof evidence that this is indeed Rei. Then we'll tell her, seeing as how she is a high ranking member of NERV. Before that? Not necessary."  
你的未婚妻一无所知。考虑到他们的过往和她上次为了证明自己无恙所付出的巨大努力，我们都觉得为了她的心安，最好在有确凿证据证明这确实是丽之前，不要告诉她。既然她是 NERV 的高级成员，届时我们会告知她。在那之前？没必要。

Shinji agreed. Was there any need to add stress on her shoulders what with the baby growing inside of her and everything? What could that sort of stress do to their son—er, child—and his—er, its—development? This was the right decision, certainly. But still, what was he going to tell his wife—er, fiancé? Nothing. That was what. Nothing at all. He'd say nothing.  
真嗣同意了。考虑到她腹中胎儿的成长以及一切，有必要再给她增加压力吗？这种压力会对他们的儿子——呃，孩子——及其——呃，它的——发育产生什么影响？这无疑是正确的决定。但尽管如此，他该对他的妻子——呃，未婚妻——说什么呢？什么都没有。就是这样。他什么都不会说。

After all, why say anything when nothing was wrong?  
毕竟，如果一切无恙，又何必多言呢？

#

From the door of the store emerged the red-haired German, holding a bar of chocolate between her delicate fingers. She inhaled the chocolate as her craving desire consumed her. She really didn't like chocolate anyway on a regular basis. It wasn't that good, just okay. She preferred real food, and yet she longed for the soft surface of these brown milky bars. Was this what those cravings were? The food cravings she had heard so much of in her books that caused women to gain weight for their baby? What a filthy, rotten joke nature had dealt the usually svelte woman.  
从店铺门口走出那位红发的德国女子，她纤细的手指间夹着一块巧克力。她深深吸入巧克力的香气，渴望之情吞噬着她。其实她平时并不怎么喜欢巧克力，觉得它不过尔尔，她更偏爱真正的食物。然而，她却渴望着这些棕色牛奶棒的柔软表面。这就是所谓的渴望吗？那些她在书中读到过的，让女性因怀孕而体重增加的食物渴望？大自然对这位通常苗条的女子开了一个多么肮脏、恶劣的玩笑。

"Pregnancy sucks," Asuka mumbled as she finished the bar, tossing it aside before turning aside, running a hand through her scarlet locks.  
“怀孕真糟糕，”明日香嘟囔着，吃完巧克力后随手一扔，转身时用手拨弄着她那鲜红的秀发。

Pigeons flew into the air, beating their wings against the crisp air as they surged toward the sky in mass. The young adult stared up at them in mild awe. Some small children birds were soaring next to their mothers, or at least that's what it looked like. It could well be that the children were really just runts that Darwinism had forgotten to dispose of, but she'd rather not think that way right then and there.  
鸽群振翅高飞，迎着清冽的空气冲向天际。年轻人抬头望着它们，心中涌起一丝敬畏。一些小鸟似乎在母亲身边翱翔，至少看起来是这样。或许那些小家伙只是达尔文主义遗忘处理的弱者，但她宁愿此刻不去那样想。

She glanced down as she started toward home. She glanced off to the side to see a young girl clinging to the hand of an older woman, whining about how the threads in her skirt had gone undone and how the older woman, not a tailor or a professional like that, was the sole person in the world who could salvage her article of clothing. As Asuka pressed on, she also noticed a young girl sobbing to herself as she looked around for her mother, tears running down her cherubic cheeks. After the mother-to-be passed the sobbing girl by, she heard the girl's real mother arrive, taking the young one into her arms.  
她低头快步走向家的方向。不经意间，她瞥见一个小女孩紧抓着一位年长女性的手，抱怨着裙子上脱线的线头，而那位并非裁缝或专业人士的年长女性，却是这世上唯一能拯救她这件衣服的人。随着明日香继续前行，她还注意到另一个小女孩独自啜泣，四处寻找她的母亲，泪水顺着她那天使般的脸颊滑落。在即将成为母亲的明日香经过哭泣的女孩后，她听到了女孩真正的母亲到来，将小女孩拥入怀中。

Was that what a real mother was supposed to do?  
这就是一个真正的母亲应该做的吗？

Nurture? 养育？

Rescue? 救援？

Repair? 修复？

She didn't know how to do any of that.  
她不知道如何做这些。

As she walked down the remainder of the distance to her house, the German redhead noticed a schoolgirl standing nearby her apartment complex. She sighed, recognizing that blue and white uniform. Come to think of it, maybe Asuka could give her old uniform to her daughter—er, child. Surely she'd—er, it—would inherit Asuka's beautiful figure.  
当她走完剩下的路程回到家时，这位德国红发女子注意到一个女学生站在她公寓楼附近。她叹了口气，认出了那身蓝白相间的校服。转念一想，也许明日香可以把她的旧校服送给她的女儿——呃，孩子。当然，她——呃，它——肯定会继承明日香那优美的身姿。

That girl looked familiar.  
那个女孩看起来很眼熟。

Maybe if Asuka would dig through her old stuff she'd find that old thing. She doubted it could fit her now with her future daughter—er, child—growing inside of her.  
如果明日香翻找一下她的旧物，或许能找到那件旧东西。她怀疑现在那东西还能不能穿，毕竟她未来的女儿——呃，孩子——正在她肚子里成长。

Her head was blocked out by that branch, but she could swear she looked familiar.  
她的头被那根树枝挡住了，但她敢肯定那张脸似曾相识。

Maybe if she asked that stupid dork to look in her stuff for her. Digging around like she wanted to with a baby in her belly was one step short of insanity. Didn't want to hurt her future daughter—er, child—did she?  
也许她该让那个笨蛋帮她找找东西。像她现在这样挺着肚子翻来翻去，简直离疯了只差一步。她可不想伤害她未来的女儿——呃，孩子——对吧？

The girl was turning around now, and walking away.  
女孩现在转过身，正走开去。

Maybe— 或许——

Blue hair. 蓝色头发。

Red eyes. 红色眼睛。

All of a sudden, the German's thoughts froze in her brain as she stared out before her at the figure slowly walking away, clearly dissatisfied with whatever she was looking at. Step after step the woman took, her delicate smooth legs moving to the beat of the angels' wings, her locks of short cut hair at the edge of her harsh jaw line bouncing up and down with the beat of her movements.  
突然间，德国人的思绪在她脑海中凝固，她凝视着前方那个缓缓走开的人影，显然对所见之物感到不满。那女人一步接一步地走着，她那细腻光滑的双腿随着天使翅膀的节奏移动，短发沿着她坚硬的颌线边缘随着她的步伐上下跳动。

That wasn't possible. 这不可能。

That doll was dead. 那个玩偶已经死了。

Rei was dead. 丽已经死了。

There she stood, no, walked, away from Asuka, and she could do nothing. All she could do was stare, her eyes wide in awe and terror, as the source of her fears and anxieties moved farther away from her, unaware that the red-haired demon who had abused her for so long was standing only ten meters away, no, twenty. She could do nothing to either run away from her or alert the doll to her presence. All she could do was stare, pick out each individual strand of hair on that girl's head as she walked, pick out every thread in her uniform as she swung her arms so briefly, see the outline of her rear-end on the skirt she wore, her rather slender and small rear. All she could see was Rei Ayanami's profile as she turned a corner, and disappeared entirely from view.  
她就那样站着，不，是走着，远离明日香，而她却无能为力。她只能瞪大眼睛，既敬畏又恐惧地看着那个让她心生恐惧和焦虑的源头渐行渐远，浑然不觉那个红发恶魔，那个长久以来一直虐待她的恶魔，就站在十米之外，不，是二十米。她既无法逃离她，也无法向那个玩偶发出警报。她只能瞪大眼睛，仔细观察那女孩头上每一根发丝的飘动，每一根制服上的线随着她手臂的摆动而晃动，看到她穿着的裙子勾勒出的臀部轮廓，那相当纤细而小巧的臀部。她只能看到绫波丽的侧脸，在她转过街角后，便彻底消失在视线之外。

Rei Ayanami wasn't alive. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead. She was dead.  
绫波丽没有活着。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。她死了。

"SHE'S DEAD!" Asuka screamed to herself, grabbing her hair tightly as she fell to her knees, staring down at the ground. She was alone in the street. No one saw her collapse, nor did anyone see her reaction. No, they couldn't have seen int. Surely not. They'd think she was crazy if they had. What if she was crazy? What if she was hysterical? What if—?  
"她死了！" 明日香尖叫着自言自语，紧紧抓住自己的头发，跪倒在地，盯着地面。她独自一人在街上。没有人看到她倒下，也没有人看到她的反应。不，他们不可能看到。肯定没有。如果他们看到了，会认为她疯了。万一她真的疯了呢？万一她歇斯底里呢？万一——？

"Asuka?" Asuka turned at the sound of her name to see Hikari, standing there not five meters, no, ten, from her, pushing the baby carriage here young Shinji laid, napping silently. At the sight of her friend, the redhead rose to her feet, her eyes still wide, sweat billowing from her pours. Were her knees shaking? Were her feet numb? She didn't know, though she was aware of the fact she couldn't stand still, nor could she breath properly. "You look like you've seen a ghost."  
"明日香？" 明日香听到自己的名字转过身，看到光，站在那里不到五米，不，十米远，推着婴儿车，她的小真嗣躺在里面，静静地睡着。看到朋友，红发女孩站起身来，眼睛仍然睁得大大的，汗水从毛孔中涌出。她的膝盖在颤抖吗？她的脚麻木了吗？她不知道，尽管她意识到自己无法站稳，也无法正常呼吸。"你看起来像是见鬼了。"

"I think I have," Asuka replied, gasping for air at last, becoming aware she had been holding her breath before.  
"我想我是见到了，" 明日香回答，终于喘了一口气，意识到自己之前一直屏住呼吸。

"Come again?" “再说一遍？”

"I just saw—no, I think I just saw—no, maybe it was—no, couldn't be—"  
"我刚刚看到——不，我觉得我刚刚看到——不，也许是——不，不可能——"

"Slow down and just speak, alright?" Hikari replied, perhaps anxious that Asuka's rambling would awaken the napping babe.  
"慢点说，好吗？" 光回应道，或许是因为担心明日香的喋喋不休会吵醒正在打盹的婴儿。

"I think I just saw Rei."  
"我觉得我刚刚看到了丽。"

"Rei? You mean Ayanami?" "Rei？你是说绫波吗？"

"Yeah, that one!" "对，就是她！"

"Isn't she dead?" "她不是已经死了吗？"

"She is, right?" "她确实是，对吧？"

"Well, you'd know better than me."  
"嗯，你比我更清楚。"

"Well, I don't know anything anymore right now. She's supposed to be dead. She should be dead. Has to be. That doll can't be alive. Was she ever alive? I don't know. Can something that wasn't really alive like a doll really be dead?"  
"好吧，我现在什么都不确定了。她应该已经死了。她本该死了。必须得死。那个玩偶不可能是活的。她曾经是活的吗？我不知道。一个像玩偶一样原本不是活物的东西，真的能算是死了吗？"

"You're not making any sense, Asuka! Just sit down and let's just—"  
"你根本说不通，明日香！坐下，我们——"

"I can't just sit down! We need to tell Shinji, or Misato, or Fuyutsuki, or someone!" Asuka stammered, about to pull away, only for Hikari to grab her by the wrist. "Let me go!"  
"我不能就这么坐下！我们需要告诉真嗣，或者美里，或者冬月，或者任何人！" 明日香结结巴巴地说，正要挣脱，却被光抓住了手腕。"放开我！"

"Listen to yourself for a second! Do you realize what you're saying?" Hikari stammered, frantically.  
"你冷静点听自己说的话！你知道自己在说什么吗？" 光结结巴巴地说，慌乱不已。"

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"What do I mean? You're hysterical! Think about it for a second! You're saying a girl who's been dead for the past decade, more than that, is alive and well and you just saw her. Do you know what they're gonna think?"  
"我是什么意思？你简直歇斯底里！冷静下来想想！你在说一个死了十年、甚至更久的女孩，现在还活着，而且你刚刚还见到了她。你知道他们会怎么想吗？"

"No."

"They're gonna think you're losing it."  
"他们会觉得你疯了。"

For a moment, the image of a woman sitting on her bed emerged in the German's mind eye. She imagined a woman seeing things too, such as seeing a girl in her hands when all that she held was a fabric doll, a doll she called her daughter. She could see the woman's real daughter standing outside of her room, kept from contacting her mother. She saw herself as a child, staring at the mother who told people what she saw.  
有那么一刻，一个女人坐在床上的画面浮现在德国人的脑海中。她想象着一个女人也在看到一些东西，比如当她手里只有一块布娃娃时，却看到了一个女孩，一个她称之为女儿的布娃娃。她能看到那个女人的亲生女儿站在房间外，无法接触到她的母亲。她看到自己小时候，盯着那个告诉别人她所见之物的母亲。

Was she going crazy? She had to be. She was saying she saw a dead girl walking around as though she were alive. What if she was becoming like her mother? Her mama? Surely, this couldn't be true. The circumstances were different, very different, but even so, what if other people didn't see it that way? What if they locked her up in a madhouse? What if everyone abandoned her? What if they took away her own future daughter—er, child?  
她是不是疯了？一定是的。她居然说自己看到一个死去的女孩像活人一样四处走动。会不会她正变得像她母亲那样？她的妈妈？这肯定不是真的。情况完全不同，非常不同，但即便如此，如果别人不这么看呢？如果他们把她关进疯人院怎么办？如果所有人都抛弃她怎么办？如果他们夺走她未来的女儿——呃，孩子怎么办？

What then? 那该怎么办？

No, that was just crazy paranoid rambling, wasn't it?  
不，那只是疯狂的偏执妄想，不是吗？

Was it worth it to find out what it was?  
知道那是什么值得吗？

"I understand. I must be stressed out and saw something," Asuka sighed, doubting her own mouth.  
"我明白了。我一定是压力太大，看到了什么，" 明日香叹了口气，怀疑起自己的话来。

"Do you want me to help you out or anything?"  
"需要我帮忙吗？"

"Can you get me some chocolate and some water?"  
“你能帮我拿些巧克力和水吗？”

Shinji Ikari opened the door to his apartment, sighing as he ran a hand up his hair, anxiously. He glanced around, hoping he could avoid looking at his fiancé for too long. If he saw her, he was afraid he'd spill the beans, crack under her forceful eyes and tell her the truth, that Rei Ayanami was alive and well, with video and photograph evidence to prove it.  
碇真嗣打开公寓的门，叹了口气，用手焦虑地捋了捋头发。他环顾四周，希望能避免长时间直视他的未婚妻。如果他看到她，他担心自己会忍不住，在她的强势目光下崩溃，告诉她真相，那就是绫波零还活着，而且有视频和照片证据可以证明。

When his eyes landed on Asuka playing her game, he was relieved. No eye contact for him. "Hey, Asuka."  
当他的目光落在正在玩游戏的明日香身上时，他松了口气。他没有与她对视。“嘿，明日香。”

No response. 没有回应。

"Uh, do you want me to get you anything to eat?"  
"呃，你想让我给你带点什么吃的吗？"

No response. 没有回应。

"Oh, uh, okay then. Chocolate?"  
"哦，呃，那好吧。巧克力？"

No response. 没有回应。

"Okay, uh, work was really rough today. How was your day?"  
"好吧，呃，今天工作真的很辛苦。你今天怎么样？"

No response. 没有回应。

"Did I do something to bother you or something?"  
"我做了什么让你不高兴的事吗？"

"Shut up." "闭嘴。"

"What's that?" Shinji stared at the redhead, concerned. Her voice was so flat, so unmotivated. She hadn't spoken like that since after Third Impact, when she was bleeding on the inside on a deserted beach, bleeding slowly through her torn intestine. He stared at her, bewildered as she stared blankly, lowering her head in shame as she turned away from Shinji, her hair falling over her face.  
"那是什么？" 真嗣盯着红发女孩，感到担忧。她的声音如此平淡，毫无生气。自从第三次冲击后，她在荒凉的海滩上内出血，肠子被撕裂，慢慢流血以来，她就没有这样说过话。他困惑地看着她，只见她茫然地低下头，羞愧地转过身去，头发遮住了脸庞。

"It's not you, don't worry. It's just—I don't know."  
"不是你的问题，别担心。只是——我不知道。"

Shinji neared his fiancé, extending his hand to comfort her, only to draw back. She was in one of her moods. Was it wise to even touch the time bomb at a time like this? Yes, she needed someone to help. He neared her again, putting a hand on her shoulder, gently. "Hey, listen, what's bothering you?"  
真嗣靠近他的未婚妻，伸出手想安慰她，却又缩了回来。她正处于情绪之中。在这种时候触碰这个定时炸弹明智吗？是的，她需要有人帮助。他再次靠近她，轻轻地将手放在她的肩膀上。“嘿，听着，你在烦恼什么？”

"I think I'm going insane is all, no big deal!"  
"我觉得我要疯了，没什么大不了的！"

"What? What do you mean?"  
"什么？你什么意思？"

Asuka began to laugh at this, but it wasn't a normal laugh. It was a hoarse, dry laugh, a cruel laugh, a laugh that bore no humor in it at all. "If I told you, you'd probably think I'm nuts. Don't worry. I know it couldn't be real. Maybe it was all just a dream I had with my eyes open."  
听到这话，明日香开始笑了起来，但这不是正常的笑声。这是一种沙哑、干涩的笑声，一种残忍的笑声，完全没有幽默感。“如果我告诉你，你大概会觉得我疯了。别担心，我知道这不可能是真的。也许这一切只是我睁着眼睛做的梦。”

"Oh, okay," Shinji mumbled, backing away. How did he deal with this? It wasn't like Asuka hadn't broken down like this before, but he couldn't just check her into a clinic like this with a baby on the way. Would they be able to treat her properly with a baby boy—er, child—in her body? What if they hurt their unborn infant, or if they somehow screwed up giving her enough food to feed their child? What if they gave her medication that could hurt their child? No, surely Asuka would need to stay out of a home as she struggled with her issues.  
""哦，好吧，“真嗣喃喃自语，向后退去。他该怎么处理这种情况？虽然明日香以前也这样崩溃过，但他不能就这样把她送到诊所，何况她还怀着孩子。他们能妥善治疗她吗，尤其是她体内还有一个小男孩——呃，孩子？万一他们伤害了未出生的婴儿，或者在给她足够的食物喂养孩子时出了差错怎么办？万一他们给她用药伤害了孩子怎么办？不，明日香肯定需要在面对这些问题时远离医院。”

But how could that work out if Asuka didn't tell him what was wrong?  
但如果明日香没有告诉他哪里不对劲，这怎么可能行得通呢？
