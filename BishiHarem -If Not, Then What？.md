这真是太美了。哇，你真的把明日香的性格巧妙地概括在几句话中。太棒了！

[Adam Kadmon](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/819499/Adam-Kadmon): Nice. I've seen some of the ideas presented here before, but I really liked how the repetition drove the points home. Asuka/Shinji is fraught with perils for serious stories (mostly for the things you said here), but with time, finesse and care, the problems can be overcome. I'd personally like to see more on this subject.  
挺好的。我之前看过这里提出的一些想法，但我真的很喜欢重复如何强化了这些观点。明日香和真嗣这对组合在严肃故事中充满了危险（主要是你在这里提到的问题），但随着时间的推移、技巧和细心的处理，这些问题是可以克服的。我个人希望能看到更多关于这个主题的内容。

[Lancetheyoung](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/767810/Lancetheyoung): Heh. Great. I loved the last line.  It basically sums up how Asuka feels about Shinji. He's everything she hates about people but he somehow manages to steal her thunder.  I think it's actually kinda sad what happens to them. They actually become pretty good friends and have some good times together, but then all of a sudden Shinji surpasses her. Then she feels threatened and lashes out at him if he tries to get close to her. Damn shame.  
嘿，真棒。我特别喜欢那最后一句话。这基本上概括了明日香对真嗣的感受。他集中了她讨厌的所有人的特质，但不知为何总能抢走她的风头。我觉得这其实挺让人难过的，他们原本成了很好的朋友，共同拥有过美好时光，但真嗣突然间超越了她，让她感到威胁。一旦他试图靠近，她就会对他发火，真是令人惋惜。

[Sum9](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/280218/Sum9): nice. very well done. the sparseness of the words and not identifying the characters really made this different. Nice use of counterpoint at the end. This would go cozily into a larger story.  The title makes perfect sense in hindsight. good job.
非常棒。做得很好。文字的简洁和角色的不明确确实让这个作品显得与众不同。结尾巧妙运用了对位法，非常适合融入一个更宏大的故事里。事后看来，标题非常合理。干得好。

I think, in a way, this may be the most concise and perhaps most accurate portrayal of Asuka and Shinji's relationship, at least from Asuka's point of view, that I've ever read.  
我觉得，从某种角度来说，这可能是我读过的最简练、也许也是最精准的明日香和真嗣关系的描绘，至少是从明日香的视角出发。
