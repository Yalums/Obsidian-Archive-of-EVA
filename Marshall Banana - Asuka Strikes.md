### Chapter 1: Enter Asuka  
第 1 章：明日香登场  

Enter Asuka 登场：明日香  
By: Byakko of the West  
作者：白虎西

Author's Notes: I'm going to try my best to be close to how the series goes but I might be off on some of the parts. Lots of Asuka/Shinji fluff and, of course, some Misato/Kaji on the side. You all probably know that I mostly write romance...considering the fact that all my story's first genre is romance, but anyway, I'm going to try my best at the action and maybe some of the more angst-y parts. Wish me luck!  
作者的话：我会尽力贴近原作的走向，但某些部分可能会有所偏差。这里有很多明日香和真嗣的甜蜜互动，当然还有美里和加持的副线。你们可能都知道，我主要写爱情故事...考虑到我的所有故事的首要类型都是爱情，但无论如何，我会尽力描写动作场面和一些更忧郁的部分。祝我好运吧！

Summary: Takes place from episode 8 where Misato, Shinji and his two friends meet Soryu Asuka Langley and Kaji Ryouji when they're bringing EVA Unit 02 from Germany, escorted by the Pacific Navy Fleet. Instead of rage- at-first-sight, Asuka envies Shinji instead of hating him and he, not being as wimpy in my story as he is in the series, is attracted to her as well. And also, Misato and Kaji never broke up eight years ago instead they just went their separate ways and she still was very strong feelings for him. The pilots are also 16 year-olds instead of 14.  
简介：故事从第 8 集开始，美里、真嗣和他的两个朋友在太平洋海军舰队的护送下，从德国接回 EVA 二号机及其驾驶员惣流·明日香·兰格雷和加持良治时相遇。与一见生厌不同，明日香对真嗣心生嫉妒而非憎恨，而在这篇故事中并不那么懦弱的真嗣也被她吸引。此外，美里和加持八年前并未分手，只是各自生活，美里对他仍怀有深厚感情。驾驶员们的年龄也设定为 16 岁而非 14 岁。

Chapter 1 第一章

"Oh woo! Look at all of them!" the voice of Kensuke was heard by all in the helicopter flying over top the fleet of boat.  
“哇哦！快看他们！”直升机飞越舰队上空时，所有人都能听到洞木光的声音。

Suzahara Toji didn't look impressed at all, leaning forward in his sit so he could put his chin in his hands, his elbows resting on his knees. "Oh whoopy! They're just boats, nothing special." He said, sarcasm dripping from his voice.  
鈴原冬二看起来一点也不感兴趣，他向前倾身，用手撑着下巴，手肘搁在膝盖上。“哦，太棒了！不过是些船而已，没什么特别的。”他说道，语气中满是讽刺。

Ikari Shinji laughed at his best friends and returned to looking out the window.  
碇真嗣对他的好友笑了笑，然后继续望向窗外。

Captain Katsuragi Misato looked forward again after finishing her conversation with the pilot of the helicopter. She smiled at the glasses- wearing student. "I knew you'd like them. I was surprised that Ritsuko didn't blow up in my face when I suggested bringing you two along."  
葛城美里上尉在与直升机驾驶员结束对话后，再次向前看去。她对那位戴眼镜的学生微笑道：“我就知道你会喜欢。我提议带你们两个一起来时，我还真没想到律子会没跟我翻脸。”

Toji sat up straight in his chair when the officer started talking to them. "Uh, well, thank you very much for bringing us with you, it's a great honor." He stuttered out, blushing madly.  
当警官开始与他们交谈时，东治挺直了腰板坐在椅子上。“呃，那个，非常感谢您带我们一起来，这是莫大的荣幸。”他结结巴巴地说着，脸红得厉害。

Misato merely waved it off. "It's no problem. Your Shinji's friends after all, ne?"  
美里只是摆了摆手。“没什么大不了的。毕竟你们是真嗣的朋友嘛，对吧？”

The basketball star groaned, dismayed that she hadn't taken him with her because she wanted to, but instead because he was a friend of the Evangelion pilot. The said boy laughed quietly and patted his friend on the back while their other friend went on about all the boats below them.  
那位篮球明星叹了口气，失望地意识到她带他来并不是因为她想这么做，而是因为他是一个 EVA 驾驶员的朋友。那个被提及的男孩轻声笑了笑，拍了拍朋友的背，而他们的另一个朋友则继续谈论着他们下方所有的船只。

A few minutes later, they landed on one of the larger vessels, waiting until the propeller atop the helicopter slowed down a bit before getting off. The purple-haired Captain was the first to hop of, followed by Shinji then lastly his friends. They began walking towards the large structure that was built on the boat when suddenly the red hat that Misato wore flew off by a gust of sea air. She went to go after it but Shinji held up his hand, smiling at her.  
几分钟后，他们降落在一艘较大的船上，等待直升机顶部的螺旋桨稍微减速后才下机。紫发的船长第一个跳下来，接着是真嗣，最后是他的朋友们。他们开始向船上建造的大型结构走去，突然，美里戴的红色帽子被一阵海风刮走了。她正要去追，但真嗣举起手，对她微笑。

"Don't worry about it, Misato-san. I'll go for it." He spoke, his hand coming back down to his side. She smiled back at him and nodded, agreeing.  
“别担心，美里小姐。我去拿。”他说着，手放回身侧。她回以微笑并点头同意。

He jogged after the seemingly floating hat, his eyes never leaving the object he chased. He was only a few centimeters away from it but before he could pick it up, a slender hand went for it the same time he did, ending up with both holding an edge of the hat. The dark haired pilot looked up to see a girl with long, beautiful red hair and glittering blue eyes.  
他小跑着追赶那似乎在空中飘浮的帽子，目光始终未离开追逐的目标。他离帽子只有几厘米之遥，但就在他伸手去捡时，一只纤细的手同时伸向帽子，结果两人各抓住了帽檐的一角。这位黑发飞行员抬头一看，眼前是一位拥有长长美丽红发和闪烁蓝眼睛的女孩。

She smiled at him and let go of the hat, extending her now empty hand towards him. "You must be the famous Third Child, Ikari Shinji." Her voice was like music to his ears, gentle but demanding at the same time.  
她对他微笑着，放开了帽子，将空出的手伸向他。“你一定就是那位著名的第三适格者，碇真嗣吧。”她的声音宛如乐曲，温柔却又带着不容置疑的坚定。

He smiled back at her and took her hand in his, shaking it. "That I am, and you are...?"  
他回以微笑，握住她的手轻轻摇了摇。“正是在下，那么您是……？”

She giggled for a second, shaking her head from side to side. "Where are my manners. My name's Asuka. Soryu Asuka Langley, the Second Child."  
她咯咯笑了一声，左右摇了摇头。“真是失礼了。我叫明日香，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，第二适格者。”

He released her hand, albeit a little reluctant. Her hand was just so warm and fit perfectly in his. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Soryu-san." He said as his friends and guardian came up beside him. "These are my friends, Suzahara Toji and Kensuke." He pointed to them respectively. He then turned to Misato. "And this is Captain Katsuragi Misato."  
他松开了她的手，尽管有些不舍。她的手温暖而恰到好处地契合在他的手中。“很高兴见到你，Soryu 先生。”他说道，此时他的朋友和监护人走到了他身边。“这两位是我的朋友，Suzahara Toji 和 Kensuke。”他分别指向他们。然后转向 Misato。“这位是 Katsuragi Misato 上尉。”

She shook Asuka's hand, smiling at the younger girl. "I've heard quite the bit about you, Miss Soryu." She told her.  
她握住 Asuka 的手，对这位年轻女孩微笑。“关于你，Soryu 小姐，我听说了不少。”她告诉她。

The redhead laughed. "Will everyone stop calling me by my last name? It makes me feel so old." She stopped laughed but still smiled at them. She went to greet the two other boys but was interrupted when a wind current came by, lifting the front of her yellow dress, exposing her red-poka- dotted underwear. Whilst shoving it back down to cover herself, she noticed Toji smirking, still eyeing where he shouldn't be. A nerve popped up from her forehead and she slapped-or more like punched- him across the face. He keeled over in pain, the wind knock out of him and onto the hard concrete of the boat.  
红发女孩笑了。“大家能不能别再叫我姓氏了？这让我感觉自己好老。”她停止了笑声，但仍对他们微笑。她正要去问候另外两个男孩，却被一阵风打断了，风掀起了她黄色裙子的前摆，露出了她红色圆点图案的内裤。在匆忙将裙子压下遮掩时，她注意到 Toji 还在偷笑，目光不当地盯着不该看的地方。她额头上的青筋一跳，随即一巴掌——或者说是一拳——打在了他的脸上。他痛苦地弯下腰，风被击出体外，重重地摔在船的硬质混凝土上。

Asuka humphed and tossed her hair back, looking smugly at the fallen boy. "You deserved that, you hentai."  
明日香哼了一声，甩了甩头发，得意地看着倒在地上的男孩。“你活该，你这个变态。”

Misato laughed and threw her arm around Asuka's shoulders, turning them away from the boys, Shinji and Kensuke helping Toji stand up. "I think you'll fit in just fine."  
美里笑着搂住明日香的肩膀，带着她转身离开，留下真嗣和健介扶起东治。“我觉得你会很合群的。”

~*~

"Captain Katsuragi! I still do not understand why the government has ordered half our fleet to escort this...this...child's plaything! We should be else-where!" the other Captain yelled at Misato.  
“葛城上尉！我还是不明白政府为什么要命令我们一半的舰队护送这个……这个……孩子的玩具！我们应该在别的地方！”另一位上尉对着美里大喊。

But the woman only smiled, staying calm. "I understand your reluctance to help us, sir. But the EVA is our top priority and if something were to happen, we would have to be prepared for the worst." She explained coolly.  
但那位女士只是微笑着，保持冷静。“我理解您不愿帮助我们的心情，先生。但 EVA 是我们的首要任务，如果发生什么事情，我们必须做好最坏的打算。”她冷静地解释道。

The sea Captain stood up from his chair, slamming his hands on the desk. "I am the Captain of the ship and I will not be told what to do unless it is from someone of higher rank!" he demanded.  
船长从椅子上站起来，双手猛地拍在桌子上。“我是这艘船的船长，除非是上级命令，否则我不会听从任何人的指示！”他强硬地要求道。

However, Misato only pulled out a folder and held it out to him. "The Commander of NERV has it all written out in here, Captain. These are direct orders from headquarters." She smiled, knowing she'd won.  
然而，葛城美里只是拿出一个文件夹，递给他。“NERV 的指挥官已经在这里面写清楚了，船长。这是总部的直接命令。”她微笑着，知道自己已经赢了。

The elder man grabbed them out of her hands and read them over quickly then growled lowly before handing them back to Misato. "Very well, but if something DOES happen, I will give the orders, do you understand?"  
那位年长者从她手中夺过文件，迅速浏览了一遍，然后低声咆哮着，将文件还给了葛城。“很好，但如果真的出了什么事，我会下达命令，你明白吗？”

Misato nodded, grinning. "Yes, of course."  
葛城点头微笑。“当然，我明白。”

Toji fanned over how incredible she was while Shinji just stared at her, amazed. "She sounded like Dr. Akagi just then." He trailed off, still incredulous about how she just preformed.  
"东治滔滔不绝地夸赞她多么了不起，而真嗣只是盯着她，感到惊讶。“她刚才说话的样子简直就像赤木博士。”他喃喃自语，仍然难以置信她刚才的表现。”

"Aw, still so demanding, Katsuragi." An amused voice said from the doorway of the room.  
"哎呀，还是这么苛刻啊，葛城。" 一个带着笑意的声音从房间门口传来。

The man in his white uniform turned to the figure. "Mr. Kaji! Have I not told you to not come on board before?"  
身穿白色制服的男子转向那个身影。"加持先生！我不是告诉过你不要未经允许就上船吗？"

Asuka turned and smiled from ear-to-ear. "Kaji!" she exclaimed happily.  
明日香转过身，笑容满面。"加持！"她开心地喊道。

Misato turned slowly towards the door, her eyes wide. "K-K-K-Kaji?!"  
葛城美里缓缓转向门口，眼睛睁得大大的。“加...加...加...加治？！”

Kaji Ryouji smirked at her. "Nice to see you again too, Katsuragi."  
加持良治对她咧嘴一笑。“也很高兴再次见到你，葛城。”

Recap of Last Chapter 上一章回顾

"Aw, still so demanding, Katsuragi." An amused voice said from the doorway of the room.  
"哎呀，还是这么霸道，葛城。" 一个带着笑意的声音从房间门口传来。

The man in his white uniform turned to the figure. "Mr. Kaji! Have I not told you to not come on board before?"  
身穿白色制服的男子转向那个身影。"加持先生！我不是告诉过你不要未经允许就上船吗？"

Asuka turned and smiled from ear-to-ear. "Kaji!" she exclaimed happily.  
明日香转过身，满脸笑容。"加持！"她开心地喊道。

Misato turned slowly towards the door, her eyes wide. "K-K-K-Kaji?!"  
碇真嗣缓缓转向门口，眼睛睁得大大的。“K-K-K-卡介？！”

Kaji Ryouji smirked at her. "Nice to see you again too, Katsuragi."  
加持良治朝她咧嘴一笑。“很高兴再次见到你，葛城。”

Chapter 2 第二章

The dark brown eyes of Katsuragi Misato widened as she saw the figure of her ex-lover standing in the doorway of the room. She hadn't seen him in...just about eight years! So, what was he doing here? "K-Kaji? What are you doing here?" she voiced her thoughts, trying not to sound as shocked as she was.  
葛城美里那深棕色的眼睛瞪大了，她看到前恋人站在房间门口的身影。她已经...差不多八年没见过他了！那么，他在这里做什么？“K-卡吉？你在这里做什么？”她脱口而出自己的想法，尽量不显得像她感觉的那样震惊。

The stubble-faced man grinned at her, walking over towards them. "Why, I'm here to escort Asuka as well, isn't that right?" he looked at the redhead for confirmation.  
那位留着胡茬的男人对她咧嘴一笑，向他们走来。“怎么，我是来护送明日香的，不是吗？”他看着红发女孩以寻求确认。

Ikari Shinji felt a pang of-what was it...jealousy? - at the happy nod of the girl he found extremely attractive. Soryu Asuka Langley, his new, fellow pilot in Angel fighting, had somehow stolen his heart. 'Probably just a little crush, nothing more...' he thought, convincingly.  
碇真嗣感到一阵——那是什么...嫉妒？——看到他极为倾心的女孩快乐地点头。惣流·明日香·兰格雷，他在天使战斗中的新同伴，不知怎么地偷走了他的心。‘可能只是一点小迷恋，没什么大不了的...’他这样想，说服自己。

Kaji then turned towards the younger man, smiling sincerely. "And you must be the ever famous Ikari Shinji." He ruffled his hair.  
加治随即转向那位年轻人，真诚地微笑着。“那你一定就是大名鼎鼎的碇真嗣了。”他揉了揉他的头发。

The younger man stared at him. "How...do you know my name?"  
年轻人盯着他。“你...怎么知道我的名字？”

Ryouji took his hand back, shoving it and it's other into his pants' pockets. "You're quite famous in the defense business you know. Took down an Angel with no training, what-so-ever." He smirked. "You're going to have a handful with Asuka, I can tell you that much." He said, resulting in a "HEY!" from her.  
Ryouji 收回手，将两只手都插进裤兜里。“你在防御界可是相当有名。未经任何训练就击败了一只使徒。”他坏笑着说，“你和明日香搭档，可有得你忙了，我敢肯定。”这话引来了她的一声“喂！”

Misato still stood where she was, trying to believe that what she saw was true. He was back. After so many years, he had returned to her. Misato shook her head, trying to throw those thoughts from her mind (A/N: lot's of 'T's in that sentence ^_^). They were over a long time ago and he was here on business, not to see her again.  
碇真嗣依旧站在原地，试图相信自己所见是真实的。他回来了。这么多年后，他再次回到了她的身边。碇真嗣摇了摇头，试图将这些思绪抛诸脑后（注：那句话里有很多'T'哦^_^）。他们早已结束，而他此行是为了公事，并非为了再见她一面。

The elderly Captain frowned at them all. "Miss Katsuragi! This room is not for little family reunions!" he informed her, loud and clear of his annoyance. He had more important stuff to attend to other than listening to a bunch of youngsters babble about 'old times'.  
老船长皱着眉头看着他们所有人。“葛城小姐！这个房间可不是用来开家庭小聚会的！”他明确地表达了自己的不悦，声音响亮而清晰。他有更重要的事情要处理，而不是听一群年轻人喋喋不休地谈论‘过去的日子’。

The woman turned to him, smiling apologetically. "Yes, sir. If you will excuse us, we will be leaving now." She put the folder down on his desk. "Just to remind you of what you're doing." She told him before shooing the teens out, Kaji following behind her.  
女子转向他，歉意地微笑着。“是的，先生。如果您能原谅我们，我们现在就离开。”她将文件夹放在他的桌上。“只是提醒您一下您正在做的事情。”她告诉他，然后催促着年轻人离开，加持紧随其后。

The ride down the elevator was less then thrilling, cramped all together in a small space. Misato tried to face Kaji but couldn't do to the fact that her face was pressed against the cage door. 'That'll leave a mark...' she thought but out loud said, "How long are you going to be staying here?" she asked the man who was pressed tightly against her back. 'Why is this elevator so small?'  
电梯下行之旅毫无刺激可言，狭小的空间里大家挤作一团。葛城美里试图面对加持，但她的脸紧贴着电梯门，无法转身。'这得留下印子了...'她心想，但嘴上却说：“你要在这里待多久？”她问身后紧贴着她的男人。'为什么这电梯这么小？'

'Little boy blue' smiled at her. "I'll be getting orders in the morning." His smile turned into a devilish smirk. "Why? Did you miss me?" he teased.  
"'小蓝孩'对她微笑道：“明早我会接到命令。”他的笑容转变成狡黠的坏笑。“怎么？想我了？”他打趣道。

She 'humphed' and tried to look away. "You wish."  
她'哼'了一声，试图转过头去。“你想得美。”

Ten seconds passed before the two only women in the elevator exclaimed madly. "DON'T TOUCH ME THERE!" answered by Suzahara Toji and Kaji's voices. "I CAN'T HELP IT!"  
十秒钟过去，电梯里仅有的两位女士疯狂尖叫起来。“别碰我那里！”苏我寺透和加濑的声音回应道。“我控制不住啊！”

~*~

"So, Katsuragi, do...you have a boyfriend, right now?" Kaji asked, trying to pull the old charm on her again.  
“那么，葛城，你现在...有男朋友吗？”加濑试图再次施展他的魅力问道。

She sipped her tea casually then grinned at him from behind the rim. "I don't think that's any of your business, now is it, Kaji?" she pushed his foot away with her own, teasing him right back. 'Two can play at that game.'  
她随意地啜了一口茶，然后从杯沿后面对他咧嘴一笑。“我觉得这与你无关，不是吗，加濑？”她用自己的脚推开他的脚，反过来逗弄他。‘这个游戏，两个人也能玩。’

He leaned back in the booth, taking a drink of his own hot beverage. "Ouch, I'm hurt." He joked, taking his foot back and crossing them in a '4' position. After he swallowed, he placed it back on the table and moved forward again, this time looking across Asuka to the boy sitting next to her. "So, Shinji, tell me. Is Misato still so wild...in bed?" he asked innocently.  
他靠在卡座上，喝了一口自己的热饮。“哎呀，我受伤了。”他开玩笑地说，收回脚并交叉成一个‘4’字形。咽下饮料后，他把杯子放回桌上，再次向前倾身，这次目光越过明日香，看向坐在她旁边的男孩。“那么，真嗣，告诉我。美里在床上还是那么狂野吗？”他天真地问道。

"WHA-!?" The whole group moved away from him, stunned, except the said woman who placed her hands on the table, her face inches from his. "What are you trying to do? Scar the child?" she asked in an angry whisper.  
“什——！？”整个小组的人都惊得远离了他，除了那位女士，她将双手撑在桌上，脸几乎贴到了他的脸上。“你想干什么？给这孩子留下心理阴影吗？”她愤怒地低声质问。

Kaji only looked at her through the corner of his eye, unmoved by the tone of her voice, then looked back at Shinji, still smiling like an idiot. "No, I guess she hasn't."  
加持只是用眼角余光瞥了她一眼，对她的语气不为所动，然后又看向真嗣，依旧像个傻瓜一样笑着。“不，我想她没有。”

As for Asuka, she merely tried to move away from her own guardian, disgusted. She so didn't want to know that, especially from the man she thought as her father! When she managed to calm down enough, she noticed something warm in her hand and looked down to investigate.  
至于明日香，她只是试图从自己的监护人身边挪开，感到厌恶。她真的一点也不想知道这些，尤其是从她视为父亲的那个人口中得知！当她终于平静下来时，她注意到手里有股温暖的感觉，低头一看，想要探究个究竟。

Shinji, seeing her look down at the booth-chair they shared, followed her gaze only to see her hand on top of his, probably found it's way there when she recoiled in shock. He blushed profusely, not used to contact with a female or this beautiful a female. He moved to take his hand back but was surprised immensely when she curled her fingers around his hand, keeping it where it was. Looking back up at her face, he found her smiling and couldn't help but smile back at her.  
真嗣看到她低头看向他们共坐的摊位椅子，便顺着她的目光看去，只见她的手正搭在他的手上，可能是她震惊后退时无意中放上去的。他满脸通红，不习惯与女性接触，更不用说如此美丽的女性了。他正要抽回手，却惊讶地发现她将手指蜷曲起来握住他的手，让它留在原处。抬头看向她的脸，他发现她在微笑，情不自禁地也对她报以微笑。

Seeing this, the other woman, across the table from the two, smiling and sat back down in her chair, her anger at the other guardian now gone. This was just what Shinji needed, a girlfriend. Who knows, maybe it would even bring up his sync ratio. She then looked at the boy's two friends to find one starring at her and the other taping everything in sight, voicing them to the recorder. Shaking her head, she sighed and folded her hands and placed her elbows on the table then put her chin atop her hands (A/N: you know, the 'Gendo pose' except her chin on the top of her hands. ^^;), closing her eyes. She felt a pair of eyes boring into her and opened her eyes to see Kaji, in a similar position, smiling at her like a love struck schoolboy. 'Just like Shinji...' instead of turning away this time however, she faintly smiled back and blushed but held his gaze none the less.  
见此情景，坐在桌对面的另一位女士微笑着重新坐回椅子上，对另一位守护者的怒气已然消散。这正是真嗣所需要的，一个女朋友。谁知道呢，或许这还能提升他的同步率。她随即看向男孩的两个朋友，发现一个正盯着她，另一个则四处拍摄，对着录音机叙述。她摇摇头，叹了口气，双手交叠，手肘支在桌上，下巴搁在手背上（注：你知道的，就是那种“源堂式”姿势，只不过她的下巴放在手背上。^^;），闭上了眼睛。她感觉到有双眼睛正注视着自己，睁开眼便看到薰，以相似的姿势，像个情窦初开的学童般对她微笑。“就像真嗣一样……”这次，她没有移开视线，而是微微一笑，脸颊泛红，却依然保持着对视。

Asuka looked over to Kaji, about to ask him a question and found him and the purple-haired woman smiling at each other, probably resuming their game of footsy under the table and decided that he, more then likely, wouldn't hear her. She turned back to the boy sitting next to her and smiled a little but tried not to. "You're coming with me, Third Child." She said before pushing him out of the booth and following him out, then dragging him up a flight of stairs, leaving two smiling guardians, one bored to death basketball player and a recording stooge.  
明日香朝加持看去，正要向他提问，却发现他和那位紫发女子正相视而笑，大概又在桌子底下玩起了脚尖游戏，心想他多半是听不见自己的话了。她转头看向坐在旁边的男孩，勉强挤出一丝微笑，却又努力不让自己笑出来。“你跟我来，第三适格者。”她说完便推他出了卡座，跟着他走出去，然后拽着他上了一层楼梯，留下两位面带微笑的监护人、一个无聊至极的篮球运动员和一个正在录音的跟班。

"Now, I'd like to introduce you to the real Evangelion." A redhead said proudly, standing in front of a large lump in the middle of one of the bigger boats. A boy stood facing her, dumbfounded.  
“现在，我想向你介绍真正的福音战士。”一位红发少女自豪地说道，站在一艘大船中央的一个庞然大物前。一个男孩站在她对面，目瞪口呆。

"Uh..."he said, highly intelligently.  
“呃……”他极其聪明地回应道。

Asuka held up her finger professionally. "You see, EVA units 00, 01 were only prototypes but my unit 02 is the real deal." Dramatically, she lifted up the cover and held it up high enough so the both of them could see inside it.  
明日香专业地竖起手指。“你看，零号机和初号机只是原型，但我的二号机才是真家伙。”她戏剧性地掀开盖子，并高高举起，让两人都能看到里面的东西。

Looking inside, Shinji spotted the large 'robot' and sweatdropped. It didn't look any different from his Eva, except, "I didn't know it was red."  
往里一看，真嗣看到了那个巨大的‘机器人’，不禁汗颜。它看起来和他的初号机没什么不同，只是，“我不知道它是红色的。”

She turned to him, glaring. "Does that matter? Red is a very beautiful color." She turned back to the EVA and walked in under the cover, followed by the other pilot, the high chest plate making a sort of tent for them to go in. After climbing up it, she stood tall and proud, her hands on her hips, smirking down at him. "This," she made a gesture with her hands to the mass she stood upon, "Is EVA Unit 02!" she announced loudly.  
"她转向他，瞪了一眼。“这有什么关系？红色是非常美丽的颜色。”她又转回向 EVA，走进覆盖下，另一位驾驶员跟随其后，高耸的胸甲形成了一个类似帐篷的空间供他们进入。爬上去后，她昂首挺胸，双手叉腰，得意地低头看着他。“这个，”她用手势指向她所站立的庞然大物，“就是二号机！”她大声宣布道。

Shinji just stared at it. Sure he'd been up close to his own EVA but he hadn't been this close! He could practically see his own reflection in the shiny, red armor.  
真嗣只是盯着它看。当然，他曾近距离接触过自己的 EVA，但从未如此接近！他几乎能在那闪亮的红色装甲上看到自己的倒影。

She watched him hold out a hand, running it along the surface of the metal- plated head. "So? What do you think of her?" she asked, smiling at him.  
她看着他伸出手，沿着金属装甲覆盖的头部表面抚摸。“那么？你觉得她怎么样？”她微笑着问他。

The dark-haired boy looked up at her, smiling back. "I'll tell you when I see how it stands up to Angel's?"  
黑发少年抬头看向她，回以微笑。“等我看看它如何对抗使徒再说吧？”

She scowled at him. "And when will that be?"  
她对他怒目而视。“那要等到什么时候？”

Before he could answer though, an earthquake erupted, shaking the boat and the two teens. Unable to keep her balance, Asuka fell from where she once stood, sliding down the coated steel. Luck for her, she slid straight for where Shinji stood and, being the gentleman he was, caught her before she hit the ground. But, because of her momentum, he fell backwards, her now straddling his lap. "I think that just answered your question."  
然而，他还没来得及回答，一场地震突然爆发，摇晃着小船和两个少年。由于无法保持平衡，明日香从她原本站立的地方跌落，顺着涂层钢板滑下。幸运的是，她直接滑向了站在那里的真嗣，而作为一位绅士，他在她落地前接住了她。但由于她的冲力，他向后倒去，她现在跨坐在他的腿上。“我想这已经回答了你的问题。”

Author's Notes: Well, not quite 2000 words but still, it was longer, ne? I'll try making my chapters longer cause I know how you guys feel, I hate short chapters too. So, to spar you some trouble and my life, the next ones will hopefully be longer. In the next chapter is the fight scene and I'm going to try my best but everyone should know by now that I don't write action so it may not be the best quality.  
作者的话：好吧，虽然没有达到 2000 字，但已经更长了，对吧？我会尝试让我的章节更长，因为我知道你们的感受，我也不喜欢短章节。所以，为了省去你们的麻烦和我的生活，接下来的章节希望能更长一些。下一章将会有战斗场面，我会尽我最大的努力，但大家应该都知道我不擅长写动作场面，所以质量可能不是最好的。

Thanks to: 鸣谢：

-Shinjin: Not everyone's personality's changed. Only Asuka, a bit of Shinji and maybe some Misato but that's pretty much all.  
-Shinjin：并非每个人的性格都发生了变化。只有明日香，真嗣和可能还有一点美里，但基本上就是这样。

-Jim: It took me a while to get used to the last name before first name scheme too but you'll get used to it eventually.  
-Jim：我也是花了一段时间才适应姓在前名在后的方式，但最终你会习惯的。

-Phoenix Knight: More chapters to come.  
-凤凰骑士：更多章节即将到来。

-Dark-Titan: As I stated earlier, I'm trying to make them longer but it's a little hard for me. But at least I'm trying and that's all that counts, right? ^^;  
-暗黑泰坦：正如我之前所说，我正努力让章节更长，虽然对我来说有点困难。但至少我在尝试，这才是最重要的，对吧？^^;

-Ebon Reaper: Thanks for the review.  
-黑曜死神：感谢您的评论。

### Chapter3: The Angel Attack Part II
Recap of Chapter 2 第二章回顾

The dark-haired boy looked up at her, smiling back. "I'll tell you when I see how it stands up to Angel's?"  
黑发少年抬头看向她，回以微笑。“等我看看它如何对抗使徒再说吧？”

She scowled at him. "And when will that be?"  
她对他怒目而视。“那要等到什么时候？”

Before he could answer though, an earthquake erupted, shaking the boat and the two teens. Unable to keep her balance, Asuka fell from where she once stood, sliding down the coated steel. Luck for her, she slid straight for where Shinji stood and, being the gentleman he was, caught her before she hit the ground. But, because of her momentum, he fell backwards, her now straddling his lap. "I think that just answered your question."  
然而，他还没来得及回答，一场地震突然爆发，摇晃着小船和两个少年。由于无法保持平衡，明日香从她原本站立的地方跌落，顺着涂层钢板滑下。幸运的是，她直接滑向了站在那里的真嗣，而作为一位绅士，他在她落地前接住了她。但由于她的冲力，他向后倒去，她现在跨坐在他的腿上。“我想这已经回答了你的问题。”

Chapter 3 第三章

"Status report!" Captain Katsuragi Misato demanded, running up to stand behind a man at the computer. Just when she was starting to get through to her ex, an Angel decided to attack. 'Damn things...'  
"“状态报告！”葛城美里上尉命令道，快步走到一个坐在电脑前的男子身后。就在她开始与前男友沟通时，一只使徒发起了攻击。‘该死的东西……’”

The man sweated nervously, typing things into the main computer extremely fast. "It just appeared out of no where! We didn't read anything on our radar until the earthquake!" he said, rolling his chair to the right so he could type something else in the returned to his post. "It's only two hundred and thirty-five meters away and closing in fast!" he looked over his shoulder at his Captain. "Sir, what do we do?"  
那人紧张地冒着汗，飞快地在主电脑上输入着什么。'它突然就出现了！地震前我们的雷达上什么都没显示！'他说着，将椅子滑向右边以便输入其他信息，然后又回到了岗位。'它离我们只有两百三十五米，而且正在迅速逼近！'他回头看向他的船长。'长官，我们该怎么办？'

The elder man frowned at the radar on the screen then, "We attack with whatever we have, full force!" he boomed while speaking into a nearby microphone.  
年长的男子紧盯着屏幕上的雷达，皱起了眉头，'我们用尽一切手段，全力攻击！'他大声说道，同时对着旁边的麦克风下达命令。

Several 'Yes sir's were heard on a speaker then everyone on that ship watched as the Angel appeared from the sea, jumping high in the air, almost taunting them to try and harm it. And they did. Using all the turrets onboard the ships, the crew began firing at the messenger of God but, to the dismay of everyone, the creature merely flopped back into the water, the huge splash causing two ships to tip over.  
扬声器里传来几声'遵命，长官'，随后船上的每个人都目睹了那只天使从海中跃出，高高跳入空中，仿佛在挑衅他们试图伤害它。他们确实这么做了。利用船上所有的炮塔，船员们开始向这个神的使者开火，但令所有人沮丧的是，那生物只是懒洋洋地落回水中，巨大的水花导致两艘船倾覆。

Misato's face held a determined look as she turned to the other Captain. "See what I meant?"  
碇真嗣的脸上带着坚定的表情，他转向另一位队长。“明白我的意思了吗？”

The man was far too frightened to answer, instead he just shook, staring at the screen as three more of his ships were taken down by the Angel.  
那人太过恐惧，无法回答，只是颤抖着，盯着屏幕，看着又有三艘他的船被使徒击沉。

"Sir! The Evangelion is moving!" the man at the computer told him. He typed something again then waited and began typing again. "The entry-plug is in! It's up and ready!"  
“长官！初号机开始移动了！”电脑前的人向他报告。他再次输入了些什么，然后等待并继续输入。“插入栓已就位！它已经准备好了！”

~*~

Five minutes ago... 五分钟前...

Getting off of the boy underneath her, Soryu Asuka Langley stood, looking around, ready for another attack. She saw the man get up and dust off his pants as if it were nothing. "Well? What do we do now?" she asked, uncertain.  
从身下的男孩身上下来，惣流·明日香·兰格雷站起身，环顾四周，准备迎接下一波攻击。她看到那个男人站起来，拍了拍裤子上的灰尘，仿佛什么事都没有发生。“那么，我们现在怎么办？”她问道，语气中带着不确定。

Ikari Shinji looked up for a minute, placing his hands in his pockets. "I think the best thing to do is get back to Misato." He looked at her then to an elevator door nearby. "Come on! Let's go!" he grabbed her hand, mostly just for the contact, and pulled her towards the door. When they reached it however, they found out that it wasn't working and Asuka proceeding to do the next best thing. Pulling a bag out from under the cover that was on top of her precious Unit 02, she took out two red plug-suits, throwing one at Shinji. "Where can we change?"  
碇真嗣抬头看了一会儿，将双手插进口袋。“我想最好的办法是回到美里那里。”他看了看她，然后看向附近的电梯门。“快点！我们走！”他抓住她的手，主要是为了接触，然后拉着她朝门口走去。然而，当他们到达时，发现电梯已经坏了，于是明日香采取了下一个最佳方案。她从覆盖在她珍贵的二号机上的布下拉出一个包，从中取出两件红色的插入栓服，扔了一件给真嗣。“我们在哪里换衣服？”

His eyes bugged out as he stared at the breastplates. This plug-suit was far too small for him. "Um...we?"  
他的眼睛瞪得老大，盯着那些胸甲。这套插入栓服对他来说实在太小了。“呃...我们？”

She nodded placing her hands on her hips. "Well, duh! Would you rather stay on this thing and die?" she asked, glaring at him.  
她点头，双手叉腰。“哎呀，这不是废话吗！你宁愿留在这东西上等死？”她问道，瞪着他。

He shook his head slowly but grimaced none the less. "Um...Soryu-san, I don't think I'll fit in this thing." He said, still holding the suit in one hand and scratched the back of his head with the other.  
他缓缓摇头，但仍然皱着眉。“呃...惣流小姐，我觉得我穿不上这个。”他说着，一手拿着衣服，另一手挠着后脑勺。

She let out a frustrated groan and took him by the ear, pulling him towards the cover once again. "You stay out here while I change." She lifted it up then turned back to him. "And no peeking!" then was submerged in the blanket.  
她发出一声懊恼的呻吟，一把揪住他的耳朵，再次将他拉向掩体。“我换衣服的时候你待在外面。”她掀起毯子，然后回头对他说：“不许偷看！”随即钻进了毯子里。

He stood there, dumbfounded at what to do and decided to just wait until she was done and hope that no one would see him in the extra-tight suit. After a few minutes, he nearly had a heart attack when she came out from her changing place. She had been wearing a dress earlier and he hadn't had a good chance to look at her...properly (A/N: You baka-hentai Shinji! Bad boy!). He hadn't noticed 'til now that she had perfect curves in all the right places. And talk about those breasts...  
他站在那里，不知所措，决定等她换好衣服，并希望没有人会看到他穿着那套特别紧身的衣服。几分钟后，当她从换衣服的地方出来时，他差点吓得心脏病发作。她之前穿着一条裙子，而他并没有好好地看过她...恰当地（作者注：你这个笨蛋变态真嗣！坏孩子！）。直到现在他才注意到，她的身材曲线完美无瑕，恰到好处。还有那胸部……

"Hey, dummkoepf (sp?)! Go get changed so we can hurry up!" she pushed him into the blanket and he took a glance back at her before going under.  
“嘿，傻瓜（拼写？）！快去换衣服，我们好快点走！”她把他推进毯子里，他在钻进去之前回头看了她一眼。

Standing there with her hands on her hips, she tapped her foot impatiently, never taking her eyes off the cover where the handsome looking boy was changing. Just when she thought she couldn't take anymore, he came out, a blush on his cheeks and covering his lower region. She raised an eyebrow at him, smirking. So much for the handsome looking part... "Are you ready to roll yet?"  
她双手叉腰站在那里，不耐烦地跺着脚，目光始终未离开封面处正在换装的英俊少年。就在她以为自己快要受不了时，他走了出来，双颊泛红，遮掩着下身。她朝他挑了挑眉，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。所谓的英俊形象也不过如此...“你准备好出发了吗？”

He nodded sheepishly, keeping his eyes on the ground, not daring to look up at her. He felt ridiculous in this suit and wished to any God that would listen to him that someone would just pop up with his own. Before he knew it, he was standing next to the sitting Asuka, inside her EVA. How he got there, he didn't know...(A/N: sorry, it's me again. It don't know how they got in there so I'm making it so that Shinji doesn't either ^^;). He listened as she went through a series of commands in, he supposed, German and after he thought it was starting up, it went dark again.  
他羞涩地点了点头，目光紧盯着地面，不敢抬头看她。穿着这身衣服，他感到无比滑稽，多么希望有哪位神明能听见他的祈求，突然出现并带来他自己的衣服。不知不觉间，他已站在坐着的明日香旁边，进入了她的 EVA。他是如何到达那里的，他自己也不清楚...（作者注：抱歉，又是我。我不知道他们是怎么进去的，所以就让真嗣也不清楚吧^^;）。他听着她用他猜是德语的指令进行一系列操作，当他以为 EVA 即将启动时，四周再次陷入黑暗。

Turning to the man next to her, she smacked him on the head. "Ikari-san! If you're going to think, think in German!"  
她转向身旁的男人，一巴掌拍在他的头上。“碇君！如果你要思考，就用德语思考！”

Nodding, Shinji began thinking of words in the weird language. "Um...lederhosen?" he thought out loud by accident and received another smack.  
点了点头，真嗣开始思考那种奇怪语言中的词汇。“呃...皮短裤？”他不小心大声想了出来，结果又挨了一巴掌。

She sighed and spoke to the computer. "Switch language to Japanese." It did so. The second child started her commands over again, this time in a language the third understood, and by the end, the insides began going through different color schemes, ending with a view of the outside, which was totally yellow because of the curtain. Annoyed, Asuka controlled the EVA to lift it's arm and remove the cover, rewarded with a view of the cloudless sky. Throwing it away, she commanded the 'robot' to get up and it did so. With the now extra weight, the boat started to sink in the water but the redhead balanced the weight to keep it leveled. A few seconds later, the image of Misato popped up to the two pilots right.  
她叹了口气，对电脑说道：“切换到日语。”电脑照做了。第二适格者重新开始下达指令，这次是用第三适格者能理解的语言，到最后，内部开始经历不同的颜色方案，最终显示出了外部景象，由于窗帘的缘故，外面完全是黄色的。阿苏卡感到恼火，操控 EVA 抬起手臂，移开遮挡物，映入眼帘的是一片无云的天空。她将窗帘扔掉，命令这个“机器人”站起来，它也照做了。由于额外的重量，船开始在水中下沉，但这位红发少女调整了重量，保持了平衡。几秒钟后，美里上尉的影像出现在两位驾驶员面前。

"Asuka, good work! Now, you've only got type A armor so you'll have to be extra careful. Is Shinji with you?" she asked hurriedly.  
“阿苏卡，干得好！现在，你只有 A 型装甲，所以必须格外小心。真嗣和你在一起吗？”她急切地问道。

He leaned over her shoulder, missing the blush that appeared on his fellow fighter's face and smiled at Misato, waving. "Hey, Misato-san! I'm here!"  
他俯身越过她的肩膀，没注意到同伴战士脸上的红晕，对着美里微笑着挥手。“嘿，美里小姐！我来了！”

Before the Captain could answer, Ikari's friends' faces popped up on the screen. Suzahara Toji smirked. "Shinji, you dog! You got a chick right where you want her! Good job!" he gave them a thumbs up.  
还没等船长回答，碇的朋友们的脸就出现在屏幕上。铃原东治咧嘴一笑。“真嗣，你这家伙！你把妹子弄到手了！干得好！”他向他们竖起了大拇指。

"You're so lucky, Shinji. You get to be in a totally different EVA, how does it feel?" Aida Kensuke asked but the two boys were pushed out of the way by Misato again.  
“你真幸运，真嗣。你能驾驶完全不同的 EVA，感觉怎么样？”相田剑介问道，但两个男孩又被美里推到了一边。

"Men..." she huffed then turned back to the pilots. "We don't know much about this Angel so be careful, understand Asuka?" Misato's battle face was on again.  
"男人啊..." 她哼了一声，然后转向飞行员们。"我们对这个使徒了解不多，所以要小心，明白了吗，明日香？" 美里再次露出了战斗时的严肃表情。

With a curt nod, the German girl looked ahead and pulled the controls a bit to test the EVA. In response, the large creation lifted its hand and retrieved its projector knife (A/N: Me again ^^; Is that what it's called? I can't remember anymore.), extended it's arms, the knife glowing ready. Asuka smirked and made the EVA jump to a different boat, forgetting about the crew inside. Shinji wasn't ready for it and accidentally fell forward, practically on top of Asuka.  
德国女孩简短地点了点头，目光前视，稍微拉了拉控制杆测试 EVA。随即，这庞大的机体举起手，取出了投影刀（作者注：我又来了^^; 是这么叫的吗？我已经记不清了。），伸展手臂，刀身发出光芒，准备就绪。明日香得意地笑了笑，操控 EVA 跳到另一艘船上，全然不顾船内的人员。真嗣还没准备好，一个踉跄差点扑倒在明日香身上。

"Shinji! This is no time for flirting, this is a real crisis! We don't have any weapons except you're knife so we have to improvise!" Misato yelled over the intercom.  
"真嗣！现在不是调情的时候，这是真正的危机！我们除了你的刀没有其他武器，必须随机应变！" 美里通过内部通讯大声喊道。

Blushing to the ears, Shinji pulled back again and stared at his feet again. Why was everyone embarrassing him today?  
脸红到耳根，真嗣再次后退，又低头盯着脚尖。为什么今天每个人都让他这么尴尬？

Jumping to another boat, Asuka stood ready, waiting for the Angel to appear. But, underestimating it when it emerged from the waters, the two hadn't known that it would be as big as it was.  
跳到另一艘船上，明日香做好准备，等待使徒出现。然而，当它从水中浮现时，两人都低估了它的体型，没想到它会如此巨大。

"WAAAHH!" the two pilots screamed in unison, crushed by the huge, whale- like creature. Mustering all her strength, Asuka used the EVA to lift it off them, but was eaten in the midst by the Angel then they found themselves underwater, in 'the belly of the beast'.  
“哇啊啊！”两位驾驶员齐声尖叫，被那巨大如鲸的生物压垮。明日香拼尽全力，用 EVA 将它抬起，却在过程中被使徒吞噬，随后他们发现自己已身处水下，陷入了‘怪物腹中’。

Staring at the radar screen, Misato began formulating a plan. "Miss! There's only five thousand feet left (A/N: is that a lot?) of cord for the power cable! The Angel is pulling them away!"  
盯着雷达屏幕，葛城美里开始制定计划。“小姐！只剩下五千英尺（A/N：这算多吗？）的电缆线了！使徒正在把它们拽走！”

"It's just like when we went fishing, ne Katsuragi?" she turned around to see her ex-lover leaning against the doorway, his eyes closed and smiling.  
“就像我们以前去钓鱼一样，对吧，葛城？”她转过身，看到她的前恋人靠在门口，闭着眼睛微笑着。

Peeved, she restrained herself from throwing something at Kaji Ryouji, which happened to be a coffee mug. "Kaji..." she droned out, "This isn't the time, or place!"  
她气恼地克制住自己，没有朝加持良治扔东西，那东西恰好是一个咖啡杯。“加持……”她拖长声音说，“这不是时候，也不是地方！”

He opened his eyes to look at her. "Once you've caught it, all you have to do is reel them in." he hinted, grinning.  
他睁开眼睛看着她。“一旦你抓住了，接下来只需慢慢收线。”他暗示道，咧嘴一笑。

"...Fishing...?" A light bulb went off on top of her head and she smiled at him before turning to the screen again, bringing the mic to her face. "Asuka! Just hang in there, I have a plan!" She turned to the Sea Captain who was still shaking in his boots. "Captain, how many boats do you have left?" she demanded.  
“...钓鱼...？”她头顶仿佛亮起了一盏灯泡，对着他微笑后，再次转向屏幕，将麦克风举到嘴边。“明日香！坚持住，我有个计划！”她转向仍在瑟瑟发抖的海上船长。“船长，你还有多少艘船？”她追问道。

Shakingly, he answered. "Two battle cruisers, this one and the carrier." He managed to get out.  
他颤抖着回答：“两艘战舰，这艘和航母。”他勉强挤出这句话。

She nodded, thinking to herself. "Get all your men off the two battle cruisers that are left."  
她点了点头，心中暗想：“让所有人员撤离剩下的两艘战舰。”

The old man seemed to awaken from his daze at this. "What did I tell you before, Captain Katsuragi!?" his voiced boomed, "I'm the Commander of this ship and I give the orders around here!"  
老人似乎被这话惊醒，声音洪亮地质问：“我之前怎么跟你说的，葛城舰长！？我是这艘船的指挥官，这里我说了算！”

Growling, she climbed the stairs to stare at his face. "We are all in danger and you're weapons have no effect on it. My plan is the closest thing to getting us out alive from here so either agree with me and live to see the ones you love or die without a goodbye." She spoke evenly.  
她低吼一声，爬上楼梯直视他的脸。“我们正处于危险之中，而你的武器对它毫无作用。我的计划是我们活着离开这里的最接近的希望，所以要么同意我，活下来见到你所爱的人，要么连告别都没有就死去。”她语气平稳地说。

Grunting, he turned to his first mate and ordered him to evacuate the other boats, putting it on manual from their ship.  
他哼了一声，转向大副命令他疏散其他船只，并从他们的船上切换到手动控制。

When all the men were off the boats, drifting in lifeboats, Misato turned to the computer again. "Asuka, listen! Here's what we're going to do: We're going to reel in the power cable so just make sure to stay inside the Angel, got it?"  
当所有人员都离开船只，漂浮在救生艇上时，Misato 再次转向电脑。“Asuka，听着！我们要这样做：我们要收回电源线，所以你一定要确保待在使徒内部，明白了吗？”

The voice over the intercom answered, "Roger!"  
对讲机里的声音回答道：“收到！”

The purple haired woman turned to the man sitting next to her, typing away. "Get the carrier between the two battle ships but further away." He didn't reply. "NOW!" nearly jumping out of his seat, the man pressed a button and the wheel that held the long cable began reversing, bringing the Angel and Evangelion along with it. "Twenty seconds until target is in position," everyone watched the screen anxiously, "ten seconds," Asuka got the knife ready, "nine, eight, seven, six, five," Kaji watched as Misato leaned forward, smiling, "four, three, two, one. Target sighted!"  
紫发女子转向坐在她旁边正在打字的男人，说道：“让航母位于两艘战舰之间，但要更远一些。”他没有回应。“现在！”她几乎要从座位上跳起来，男人按下一个按钮，卷着长电缆的轮子开始反转，带着天使和福音战士一起移动。“目标进入位置还有二十秒，”所有人都紧张地盯着屏幕，“十秒，”明日香准备好刀子，“九，八，七，六，五，”加持看着美里向前倾身，微笑着，“四，三，二，一。目标已锁定！”

"FIRE!" Misato ordered and they complied by pressing down on a blinking red button, which set off the turrets. The EVA jumped from the Angel's now open mouth and onto one of the boats, waiting for the right moment. When the AT field was disabled momentarily by the firing, Unit 02 lunged forward, piercing the red sphere with its knife. A second later, the Angel disappeared.  
"“开火！”美里下令，他们按下闪烁的红按钮，启动了炮塔。EVA 从天使张开的口中跳出，落在一艘船上，等待合适的时机。当 AT 力场被射击暂时解除时，二号机向前猛冲，用刀刺穿了红色球体。一秒后，天使消失了。”

"WooHoo!" cheering, everyone on the ships began jumping around, laughing and clapping. Not noticing what she was doing, Misato un-expectingly jumped into Kaji's arms. She looked at the person who'd caught her and frown before pulling away again, dusting off her shirt as if he was some sort of germ. When she was done, she grabbed the microphone, smiling. "Good work, you two! Get back onto the carrier."  
"哇哦！"欢呼声中，船上的人们开始蹦跳、大笑、鼓掌。没注意到自己的举动，美里意外地跳进了加持的怀里。她看着接住自己的人，皱了皱眉，然后挣脱开来，拍了拍衬衫，仿佛他是什么细菌似的。整理完毕后，她拿起麦克风，微笑着说："干得好，你们两个！回到航母上来吧。"

### Chapter 4: At School and Sync Tests
Recap of Chapter 3 第 3 章回顾

"FIRE!" Misato ordered and they complied by pressing down on a blinking red button, which set off the turrets. The EVA jumped from the Angel's now open mouth and onto one of the boats, waiting for the right moment. When the AT field was disabled momentarily by the firing, Unit 02 lunged forward, piercing the red sphere with its knife. A second later, the Angel disappeared.  
"“开火！”美里下令，他们按下闪烁的红按钮，启动了炮塔。EVA 从天使张开的口中跳出，落在一艘船上，等待合适的时机。当 AT 力场被射击暂时解除时，二号机向前猛冲，用刀刺穿了红色球体。一秒后，天使消失了。”

"WooHoo!" cheering, everyone on the ships began jumping around, laughing and clapping. Not noticing what she was doing, Misato un-expectingly jumped into Kaji's arms. She looked at the person who'd caught her and frown before pulling away again, dusting off her shirt as if he was some sort of germ. When she was done, she grabbed the microphone, smiling. "Good work, you two! Get back onto the carrier."  
"哇哦！"欢呼声中，船上的人们开始蹦跳、大笑、鼓掌。没注意到自己的举动，美里意外地跳进了加持的怀里。她看着接住自己的人，皱了皱眉，然后挣脱开来，拍了拍衬衫，仿佛他是什么细菌似的。整理完毕后，她拿起麦克风，微笑着说："干得好，你们两个！回到航母上来吧。"

~*~

"Oh man, she was such a female dog, if you know what I mean..." Suzahara Toji snickered, remembering what had happened just a few hours ago.  
"哦，她真是个母狗，你懂我的意思吧……" 须乡朝比奈窃笑着，回忆起几个小时前发生的事情。

"Well, you don't have to worry anymore, buddy. We won't be seeing her for a while now." Aida Kensuke piped in, watching the footage he'd recorded that same day on his video recorder.  
"好了，伙计，你不用担心了。我们暂时不会再见到她了。" 相田健介插话道，他正看着当天用摄像机录下的视频。

Ikari Shinji stayed silent as his friends insulted his crush. 'Why are they so mean to her? I mean, Toji did look up her dress, even if it was an accident.'  
碇真嗣沉默地听着朋友们侮辱他的暗恋对象。'为什么他们对她这么刻薄？我是说，东治确实无意中偷看了她的裙子。'

The basketball star wrapped his arms around the back of his chair, smirking. "Yeah, but Shinji here has to see her almost everyday since he's going to be working with her." He nudged the EVA pilot awake.  
篮球明星双臂环抱椅背，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。"是啊，但真嗣这家伙几乎每天都要见到她，因为他要和她一起工作。"他轻轻推醒了 EVA 驾驶员。

Shinji just sighed, a lovey-dovey look appearing on his face. "It's not that bad..." he trailed off as the door to the classroom slid open quickly.  
真嗣只是叹了口气，脸上露出一丝陶醉的表情。"其实也没那么糟……"他话音未落，教室的门就被迅速推开了。

"WAH!?" Toji pointed his finger at the figure that had appeared. "W-w-w-w-w- what is she doing here?!"  
"哇！？" 东治指着突然出现的人影，"她、她、她、她、她怎么会在这里？！"

The figure walked to the front of the class, writing her name neatly on the chalkboard then turned around, a smile on her lips. "My name's Soryu Asuka Langley. Pleased to meet you, I'm sure."  
那人影走到教室前面，在黑板上工整地写下自己的名字，然后转过身来，嘴角挂着微笑。"我的名字是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴见到大家，我相信我们会相处愉快的。"

Toji looked as though he was about to faint while Kensuke was mildly surprised and Shinji held a soft smile, his features soft.  
东治看起来快要晕倒了，而剑介只是略感惊讶，真嗣则保持着温和的微笑，神情柔和。

~*~

"Asuka this, Asuka that. Jeez, you'd think that people would see her for who she really is and not just some pretty face." Kensuke complained, taking the money from a younger student and handing him photos in return.  
"明日香这个，明日香那个。哎，真希望人们能看清她的真面目，而不是只把她当作一个漂亮脸蛋。" 健介抱怨道，从一个低年级学生那里接过钱，并递给他照片作为交换。

Shinji looked over to his friend, his face blank of emotion. "And what is she really like?" he asked sharply.  
真嗣看向他的朋友，脸上毫无表情。"那她到底是什么样的人？" 他尖锐地问道。

Toji lifted the negatives of the photos his friend had taken, grimacing in pain. "You were there, Shinji. She really hits hard."  
东治举起朋友拍摄的照片底片，痛苦地皱起眉头。"真嗣，你当时在场。她打人真的很痛。

The Third Child only looked forward again, his mind wondering to the girl they'd been talking about.  
第三适格者只是再次向前看去，思绪飘向了他们刚才谈论的那个女孩。

~*~

"Gutten Morgen, Ikari." The boy turned around to see his redheaded comrade behind him, a smile on her face. Asuka had recently joined his school and, to his immense surprise and great luck, she had been enrolled in his class. The hot-tempered female came up behind him, one hand on her hips and the other carrying her bag.  
“古滕摩根，碇。”男孩转过身，看到红发同伴站在他身后，脸上带着微笑。明日香最近加入了他的学校，令他大为惊讶且幸运的是，她被分到了他的班级。这位脾气火爆的女孩走到他身后，一手叉腰，另一手提着书包。

Shinji gulped nervously, unaware that she'd been behind him. "G-guttin M- morgin." His accent was ridiculous and he mentally hit himself. 'You probably just insulted her.'  
真嗣紧张地咽了口唾沫，没意识到她就在他身后。“古...古滕...摩根。”他的口音荒谬至极，他内心自责不已。'你刚才可能已经冒犯到她了。'

"So, the First is here too, ne?" she asked, looking around for anyone but only found hormone-driven boys with hearts in their eyes following her.  
"那么，第一适格者也在这里，对吧？" 她环顾四周，寻找着任何人，却只发现一群荷尔蒙旺盛的男孩，眼中闪烁着爱慕之情，紧随其后。

He blinked, "Um...what do you mean, Soryu?" 'First, first, first...first what?'  
他眨了眨眼，"呃...你什么意思，Soryu？" '第一，第一，第一...什么的第一？'

She smacked him on the back of the head again but kept her smile. "The First Child, you dummkopf! I was informed that she was here too." She put her hand on her hip again. "So, where is she?" she demanded.  
她再次拍了拍他的后脑勺，但脸上依旧挂着微笑。"第一适格者，你这个笨蛋！我被告知她也在这里。" 她再次将手放在腰上。"那么，她在哪儿？" 她追问道。

He blinked again, this time understanding but still confused. "Oh, you mean Ayanami? She's down there." He pointed to a blue haired, pale skinned girl reading a book, all by herself.  
他再次眨了眨眼，这次明白了但仍旧困惑。“哦，你是说绫波吗？她在下面。”他指向一个蓝发、肤色苍白的女孩，她正独自一人阅读着一本书。

Asuka made a face at her. "Man, what's with you two? You guys are so not social!" she exclaimed before walking down the escalator and over to the other girl. Shinji followed suite, groaning softly. 'Asuka won't like her...'  
明日香对她做了个鬼脸。“天哪，你们俩怎么回事？你们真是太不合群了！”她大声说道，然后走下自动扶梯，向另一个女孩走去。真嗣跟在后面，轻声叹了口气。‘明日香不会喜欢她的...’

Once she reached her, Asuka did it on purpose so that the other one couldn't read her book. But, to her surprise, she just moved over so that Unit 02's pilot's shadow was out of the way. Growling, she took a step forward, casting her shadow on the book again and was rewarded by the partially-albino child to look up at her.  
一走到她身边，明日香故意挡住了对方看书的视线。但令她惊讶的是，对方只是挪了挪位置，让二号机的驾驶员的影子不再挡住书本。明日香低吼一声，向前迈了一步，再次将影子投射在书上，这次她得到了回应——那个半白化病的孩子抬头看向了她。

"Yes?" Ayanami Rei asked, her features not showing any emotions.  
"是吗？" 绫波丽问道，她的表情没有任何情绪波动。

"You're the First Child? Oh well! My name's Asuka, Soryu Asuka Langley, nice to meet you, let's be friends." She held her hand out for Rei to shake.  
"你就是第一适格者？好吧！我叫明日香，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，很高兴认识你，我们做朋友吧。" 她伸出手来让丽握手。

The other just looked at it then back at Asuka's face. "I would do so if I was ordered to."  
对方只是看了看她的手，然后又看向明日香的脸。"如果我被命令这么做，我会做的。"

Face-faulting, she took her hand back. "Come on! It'll be fun! If we're going to be pilots together, we should be friends, right?"  
她尴尬地收回手，说道：“来吧！会很好玩的！既然我们要一起当飞行员，就应该成为朋友，对吧？”

Rei only went back to her book, ignoring the attention seeker.  
绫波只是继续看她的书，无视了那个寻求关注的人。

Asuka huffed then turned on Shinji, knowing he would acknowledge her. "Why are you people so boring?" she asked loudly, grabbing the near-by class rep, Hikari, by the hand and dragging her away. "Let's go, Hikari, we'll find something more fun to do."  
明日香哼了一声，然后转向真嗣，知道他会理睬她。“你们这些人怎么这么无聊？”她大声问道，抓住旁边的班长，光，的手，拉着她离开。“走吧，光，我们去找点更有趣的事情做。”

(A/N: Sorry, just had to put this: if I ever find out who was driving the car that splashed me, I swear to God, you better watch your back cause I'll be stepping on it. Okay, that's all ^^;)  
(作者注：抱歉，忍不住要吐槽一下：如果让我知道是谁开车溅了我一身水，我发誓，你最好小心点，我会踩回去的。好了，就这些 ^^;)

"Good job, you two. You can go get changed now." Akagi Ritsuko said, then leaned back again, writing something on her clipboard.  
“干得好，你们俩。现在可以去换衣服了。”赤木律子说道，随后又靠回椅背，继续在她的写字板上写着什么。

"Hey, where's Ayanami?" Shinji asked as the gross-tasting LCL fluid drained out of the plug he sat in.  
“嘿，绫波在哪里？”碇真嗣问道，同时他坐在插入栓中，那股难闻的 LCL 液体正被排出。

This time Katsuragi Misato replied. "She came in earlier and got them over with already." She turned to her college-buddy. "So, how'd they do?" she asked curiously.  
这次是葛城美里回答道：“她早些时候进来了，已经完成了。”她转向她的大学好友。“那么，他们做得怎么样？”她好奇地问道。

Nodding to herself, Ritsuko continued to write. "Shinji did extremely well for him and Asuka's are higher than the one's the NERV in Germany recorded." She told her friend.  
律子自顾自地点头，继续写着。“真嗣表现得非常好，而明日香的分数比德国 NERV 记录的还要高。”她告诉她的朋友。

Smiling, Misato looked at a camera and saw the two pilots laughing at something. "I think it's love." She said, crossing her arms.  
美里微笑着，看向摄像头，看到两位驾驶员因为某事而笑。“我觉得这是爱情。”她说着，交叉双臂。

The blonde laughed lightly, taking her glasses off. "Love, hmm?" she tucked them into her lab-coat's breast pocket. "Something I heard you're experiencing all over again, no?"  
金发女子轻声笑了起来，摘下眼镜。“爱情，嗯？”她将眼镜塞进实验服的胸前口袋里。“听说你又重新体验了一遍，不是吗？”

Groaning, Misato picked up her coffee, taking a long chug. "Urg! You heard he's here too?"  
美里呻吟一声，拿起咖啡，大口喝了起来。“呃！你也听说他来了？”

She laughed again. "Been a long time since you two went out, who knows, maybe he's changed." She started walking over to the elevator door, followed by Misato.  
"她再次笑出声。“你们俩很久没一起出去了，谁知道呢，也许他变了呢。”她开始向电梯门走去，美里紧随其后。”

"He hasn't in the least! He's still immature, sloppy-looking and an even bigger womanizer than before!" The Captain complained, pressing a button on the panel.  
"他一点都没变！还是那么幼稚，邋遢，甚至比以前更花心了！" 船长抱怨着，按下了面板上的一个按钮。

"Hmm, but those were all the things you fell in love with all those years ago, am I right?" she smiled as her friend took her purple hair in two handfuls, pulling tightly while shaking her head.  
"嗯，但这些不正是多年前让你倾心的那些特质吗，我说得对吧？" 她微笑着，看着朋友抓起自己的紫色长发，双手紧握，摇头晃脑。

"Don't remind me!" "别提了！"

Author's Notes: Meh, even though it was a short chapter, the next will be longer (don't I always say that...). I just watched a couple episodes and can tell that the chappie with the dance moves attack is going to be good cause I'll be nice and hyper for that. That's my favorite episodes and I like to sing the music, it's hilarious.  
作者的话：嗯，虽然这一章很短，但下一章会更长（我不是总这么说嘛...）。我刚看了几集，可以预见那个带有舞蹈动作攻击的章节会很精彩，因为我到时候会很兴奋，状态很好。那是我最喜欢的几集，我喜欢唱里面的音乐，太搞笑了。

Chapter 5 第五章

Typing away at her computer, Akagi Ritsuko didn't expect the arms of her long lost college friend to wrap around her shoulders. She didn't even have to turn around to figure out who it was. "Why, hello there. Long time no see."  
正在电脑前忙碌的赤木律子，没料到久未谋面的大学好友会突然从背后拥抱她。她甚至不用回头就知道是谁。“哎呀，好久不见。”

Kaji Ryouji chuckled, the sound of rumbling in his chest. "Likewise." He smirked and ran a finger down her cheek. "It's been too long."  
加持良治轻笑出声，胸腔中传来低沉的震动。“彼此彼此。”他嘴角勾起一抹笑意，手指轻抚过她的脸颊。“真是太久没见了。”

The blonde smiled, closing her eyes. "Yes, it has Kaji. What have you been up too?"  
金发女子微笑着，闭上了眼睛。“是的，有卡吉。你最近在忙些什么呢？”

The man's finger stopped at her jaw line. "A little bit of this, a little bit of that." He paused and she could tell he was grinning. "You're suffering from an unrequiting love."  
男子的手指停在了她的下巴线上。“这边一点，那边一点。”他停顿了一下，她能感觉到他在咧嘴笑。“你正遭受着单相思的折磨。”

"Oh?"

He tapped her chin lightly. "A woman, with a mole like a tear, shouldn't have to suffer that sort of pain." He teased, grinning widely.  
他轻轻地敲了敲她的下巴。“一个有着泪痣般痣的女人，不应该承受那种痛苦。”他打趣道，咧嘴大笑。

She laughed softly. "If you're trying to pull the moves on me, I'm afraid you can't." she opened her eyes to see her other college friend. "Not with that face pressed up against the glass."  
她轻声笑道：“如果你想对我施展魅力，恐怕你做不到。”她睁开眼睛，看到另一位大学朋友。“尤其是那张脸紧贴在玻璃上。”

The man looked up to see his ex-lover with her face indeed pressed up against the large pan of window and he could defiantly see that she was mad by the amount of steam on the glass. Katsuragi Misato pulled away and stormed into the room they were in.  
男子抬头一看，果然见到前恋人脸紧贴在大片窗户上，从玻璃上的蒸汽量可以明显看出她很生气。葛城美里撤开脸，怒气冲冲地走进了他们所在的房间。

The Captain turned on the spy who was now leaning against the wall as if nothing had happened while Ritsuko continued with her typing. "What are you still doing here? Unit-02 is here so why haven't you left yet?" though the words came out bitterly, she silently wished that he didn't have to leave as quickly as she wished for.  
队长转向那个此刻正若无其事地靠在墙上的间谍，而律子则继续敲打着键盘。“你还留在这里做什么？二号机已经到了，你怎么还没走？”虽然话语中带着苦涩，她内心却暗自希望他不必如她所愿那般迅速离开。

The man only continued to grin at her. "Now, is that any way to talk to your boyfriend?"  
那男人只是继续对她咧嘴笑。“现在，这就是你和男朋友说话的方式吗？”

A vein popped from her forehead. "And who said that you were my boyfriend?" she demanded.  
她额头上的青筋暴起。“谁说你是我男朋友了？”她质问道。

Kaji just chuckled, shrugging his shoulders and Ritsuko was about to join in but was interrupted as red lights turned on, a voice coming from the speakers in the room. "Red Alert! Unidentified Object approaching the shores of Tokyo-3, all personal report to their posts." It repeated what it had just said and then turned off, the lights continuing to clicker on and off.  
薰只是轻笑一声，耸了耸肩，律子正要加入，却被房间里扬声器传来的声音打断。“红色警报！有不明物体正接近第三新东京市海岸，所有人员立即返回岗位。”它重复了刚才的话，然后关闭，灯光继续闪烁。

~*~

"Shinji, Asuka! You two are going to cover this mission. Close in and take turns." The voice of their Captain ordered through the link of the EVAs.  
"真嗣，明日香！你们两个负责这次任务。靠近并轮流行动。" 他们的队长通过 EVA 的链接命令道。

"Roger!" Soryu Asuka Langley and Ikari Shinji chorused together, nodding in affirmative. After the restraints were removed and they'd been launched, the two pilots awaited at the shore, battle ready. The redhead turned to Shinji and smirked at the small picture that popped up to her right. "I'll take care of this one, Ikari. Cover me!" She told him and looked back just as a large wave erupted from the waters, showing the arrival of their opponent. Before he could reply, she'd taken off to meet it in the waters, jumping from building to building to stay out of the water.  
"收到！" 惣流·明日香·兰格雷和碇真嗣齐声应答，点头确认。在解除束缚并发射后，两位驾驶员在岸边待命，战斗准备就绪。红发少女转向真嗣，对着她右侧弹出的小图像咧嘴一笑。"我来对付这个，碇。掩护我！" 她告诉他，然后回头看去，只见一道巨浪从水中涌起，显示着对手的到来。没等他回应，她已经冲向水中，从建筑物跳到建筑物，以避开水面。

The man growled, bringing his rifle up to the robot's chest, ready to back her up. "Don't tell me how to do things, you damn rookie!" then his features softened. "Just be careful, Asuka..." he whispered.  
那人咆哮着，将步枪举到机器人胸前，准备支援她。"别告诉我怎么做，你这该死的新手！" 随后他的表情缓和下来。"只是要小心，明日香……" 他低声说道。

She blushed as she heard what he had said but then it disappeared as the Angel emerged from the waters. She grimaced at the way it looked and thought, 'Don't any of these things look anywhere near normal?' before jumping high into the air above the creature's head. "Watch and learn, Ikari." With a loud battle cry, her EVA came down hard on the opponent with its bladed spear, cutting it in half. "Quick and clean." She told her comrade. He would have replied to this had he not been too surprised as the Angels' two parts began moving again, the head going into the body and coming out again, a different color this time. The same happened on the other side and Shinji realized too late that it had regenerated.  
听到他的话，她脸颊一红，但随着天使从水中浮现，那抹红晕又迅速消退。她对天使的模样皱了皱眉，心想：“这些家伙难道就没有一个看起来正常点的吗？”随即她高高跃起，凌驾于怪物头顶之上。“看好了，碇。”伴随着一声激昂的战吼，她的 EVA 手持利刃长矛猛烈劈下，将对手一分为二。“干净利落。”她向同伴说道。若非被眼前一幕惊得目瞪口呆，他本会回应她；只见天使的两半身躯竟又开始活动，头部融入躯干又重新冒出，这次换成了不同的颜色。另一侧亦是如此，真嗣这才意识到为时已晚，它已完成了再生。

~*~

"The eighth Angle was detected on our radar at thirteen hundred sharp." Ritsuko pressed a button on the controller she held and the screen changed to a picture of the Angel. "EVA Units 01 and 02 arrived before the battle." Another click of the button and it changed to a picture of the EVAs. "The battle started at 13:15." It showed Asuka attacking the Angel. "EVA Unit 02 was silent at 13:17." The screen showed the EVA upside down in the waters. "EVA Unit 01 was in a similar state short seconds later." True to her word, it showed EVA 01 upside down in a hole in the ground. "The Captain summarized this occurrence." She pressed another button and Misato's voice rang out in the conference room. "This is pathetic." Everyone heard her say and she sweatdropped. "N2 mines were used on the Angel, giving us some time." The last image showed the two halves of the Angel standing in the water, disfigured.  
"第八使徒于十三点整出现在我们的雷达上。" 律子按下手中控制器上的按钮，屏幕切换至使徒的图像。"EVA 初号机和二号机在战斗前已抵达。" 再次点击按钮，画面变为两台 EVA 的照片。"战斗于 13 时 15 分开始。" 屏幕显示明日香攻击使徒的情景。"EVA 二号机于 13 时 17 分陷入沉默。" 画面中，二号机倒挂在水中。"EVA 初号机几秒钟后也处于类似状态。" 果如其言，屏幕上初号机倒挂在地面上的一个坑洞中。"司令总结了这一事件。" 她再次按下按钮，会议室内响起美里的话语："真是丢人。" 众人听到她的话，不禁汗颜。"对使徒使用了 N2 地雷，为我们争取了些时间。" 最后的图像显示，使徒的两半身躯站立在水中，已严重变形。

Kaji smiled, taking his arm off the back of Misato's chair. "And you couldn't hope for more, ne?"  
加持微笑着，将手臂从葛城美里的椅背上移开。“你也别无所求了，对吧？”

Asuka decided to ignore him and stood up and pointed a finger at Shinji. "This is all your fault, you were supposed to back me up!" she accused.  
明日香决定不理他，站起来用手指着真嗣。“这都是你的错，你本应该支持我的！”她指责道。

He stood up to protest back. "M-my fault?! How is this my fault?! If you hadn't rushed in like you owned the place, we might have had a better chance!" he really didn't want to be yelling at her and regretted it right away when she looked down at her feet, her bangs hiding her eyes from him.  
他站起来反驳。“我的错？！这怎么是我的错？！如果你没有像这里是你的一样冲进去，我们可能还有更好的机会！”他真的不想对她大喊大叫，当她低头看着自己的脚，刘海遮住了她的眼睛时，他立刻后悔了。

'He's right...I should have co-operated with him instead of doing it by myself. I'm such an idiot...' she thought and was about to apologize but Misato cut her off.  
‘他是对的...我应该和他合作而不是自己一个人做。我真是个白痴...’她想着，正要道歉，但美里打断了她。

"Okay, you two, stop fighting. We have approximately five days before the Angel regains its full strength and we have to come up with a plan by then." She turned to Ikari Gendo and his Vice-Commander, Fuyutski Kozo. "Sir, I may have a plan to defeat the Angel. May I have permission to prepare the pilots for it?" she asked.  
好了，你们两个，别打了。天使大约还有五天就会恢复全部力量，我们得在那之前制定出计划。" 她转向碇源堂和他的副指挥官冬月耕造。"长官，我可能有一个击败天使的计划。请问我可以准备让驾驶员们执行吗？" 她询问道。

Gendo nodded curtly. "See to it that this doesn't happen again, Captain." With that, the ground beneath him sunk down, his and Fuyutski's bodies sinking with it.  
源渡简短地点了点头。“确保这种事不会再发生，上尉。”说完，他脚下的地面下沉，他和冬月随着地面一同沉了下去。

Asuka looked up at her guardian. "What's your plan?" she asked quietly, still thinking about her actions.  
明日香抬头看向她的监护人。“你有什么计划？”她轻声问道，仍在思考自己的行为。

Misato turned on the redhead, frowning. "You and Shinji go home, I'll meet you there later." She ordered harshly and Shinji felt a rush of anger at her voice towards Asuka. He calmed himself down as he walked towards the changing room then to leave for home.  
葛城转向红发少女，皱起眉头。“你和真嗣先回家，我稍后会去找你们。”她严厉地下令，真嗣对她的语气感到一阵愤怒，但随即在走向更衣室准备回家的路上平复了情绪。

~*~

Author's Notes: Though it was a short chapter, I thought of making it the whole battle but that would have maybe been around 5000 words and I just wouldn't be able to handle that _ ! Also, please check out my other story, ''What if...' Kaji Hadn't Died?' because it's coming to a close very soon and then I'm going to start on a sequel.  
作者的话：虽然这一章很短，我本想把整个战斗都写进去，但那可能要写到 5000 字左右，我实在应付不来！另外，请关注我的另一部作品《如果……加持没有死呢？》，它即将完结，之后我会开始写续集。

Chapter 6 第六章

With a tired sigh, Ikari Shinji slid the door to his room, readying to drop onto his bed and get a very-much needed rest. When he opened his eyes, prepared to see a dark and lifeless room, they meet up with a yellow, box- filled room. He blinked in confusion and turned to the door as it opened, unprepared to see you stepped through it.  
带着疲惫的叹息，碇真嗣滑开房门，准备一头栽倒在床上，好好休息一番。当他睁开眼，准备面对一个昏暗无光的房间时，却意外地看到了一个充满黄色箱子的房间。他困惑地眨了眨眼，转头看向打开的门，没想到你会走进来。

With a smile on her face, Soryu Asuka Langley closed the door behind her. "Hey, Ikari. Like what I've done with it?" she motioned to the room they stood in.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷面带微笑地关上身后的门。“嘿，碇。喜欢我布置的吗？”她指了指他们所站的房间。

His mouth opened and closed like a fish's searching for air, staring unblinking at the redhead. After he managed to register her in his room or albeit lack there of, he blinked a few times rapidly. "W-w-w-what are you doing here, Soryu-san?" he asked, not meaning to sound so hasty.  
他的嘴巴像寻找空气的鱼一样张合着，目不转睛地盯着红发少女。在他终于意识到她出现在自己的房间，或者说，这里已经不再是他的房间后，他快速地眨了几下眼睛。“惣流小姐，你……你在这里做什么？”他问道，无意中显得有些急促。

Her smile disappeared a moment after those words left his lips, her eyes downcast. "Misato thought it would be better to train together if we lived together. How she figured that, I don't know." She mumbled the last part to herself.  
她听完他的话后，笑容瞬间消失，眼神低垂。“美里觉得如果我们住在一起，一起训练会更好。她怎么想的，我也不清楚。”她小声嘀咕着，仿佛在自言自语。

They stood in an awkward silence for a few minutes until Shinji decided to break the silence by clearing his throat. "I, um...hope you like it here." He tried smiling but it came out as a goofy grin to which she giggled at.  
他们尴尬地沉默了几分钟，直到真嗣决定打破沉默，清了清嗓子说：“我，嗯……希望你喜欢这里。”他试图微笑，却露出了一个滑稽的傻笑，她见状不禁轻笑出声。

"I'm sure I will, Ikari-kun." She smiled back at him.  
“我相信我会喜欢的，碇君。”她微笑着回应他。

He blushed but kept smiling at her. "Please call me Shinji. Ikari makes me sound like my dad." He growled at the thought of his father, Commander Ikari Gendo of NERV, who he worked for and hated with all his might.  
他脸红了，但仍对着她微笑。“请叫我真嗣。叫我碇的话，感觉就像在叫我的父亲。”想到他的父亲，NERV 的司令官碇源堂，他工作的地方，也是他全心全意憎恨的人，他不禁低吼了一声。

She nodded, still smiling, not noticing the malcontent look on his features. "Okay Shinji, but you have to call me Asuka." She picked up a box to her left, written 'ASUKA'S STUFF' on it in bold, black marker. "I'm going to take a bath, is that alright with you?" she picked out a pair of blue short-shorts and a yellow tank-top from the box, standing up again to look him in the eye.  
她点头，依旧微笑着，没有注意到他脸上的不满。“好的，真嗣，但你得叫我明日香。”她从左边拿起一个盒子，上面用粗黑的马克笔写着‘明日香的物品’。“我去洗个澡，你介意吗？”她从盒子里挑出一条蓝色的短裤和一件黄色的背心，站起来再次直视他的眼睛。

Gulping down the lump of nervousness that amounted in his throat, he nodded, his face beet-red. She smiled at him once more before walking off into the shower and he released the breath he unknowingly held, his face returning to its normal color. "That girl's going to be the death of me..." he said quietly, hearing the water in the bathroom turn on.  
他咽下喉咙里积聚的紧张感，点了点头，脸红得像甜菜。她再次对他微笑，然后走向浴室，他这才意识到自己一直屏住呼吸，脸色也恢复了正常。“那个女孩会要了我的命的……”他轻声说道，听到浴室里的水声响起。

"Well, that's too bad for you Shin-chan. You're going to be spending the whole week with her." He turned to see his guardian, Captain Katsuragi Misato standing there with a boom box in her hands, smirking at him.  
"哎呀，真可惜啊，真嗣君。你得和她一起度过整整一周了。" 他转头一看，只见他的监护人葛城美里上尉站在那里，手里拿着一台手提音响，正对着他坏笑。

He groaned and followed her to his room. "Why me.?"  
他呻吟一声，跟着她走向自己的房间。"为什么是我？"

~*~

With a 'ding', the elevator doors opened revealing Suzuhara Toji and his friend, Aida Kensuke. They came out of the elevator and turned to their left wen they heard another small bell only to see their class representative and Toji's crush, Horaki Hikari. She turned to her right just as they turned to her and smiled at Toji.  
随着'叮'的一声，电梯门打开，露出铃原东治和他的朋友相田剑介。他们走出电梯，向左转时，又听到一声轻微的铃声，只见他们的班长，也是东治的暗恋对象，洞木光。她刚好向右转，与他们目光相遇，对东治微微一笑。

"Two of the three stooges, where's the other?" she asked, her voice sending the basketball star onto cloud nine.  
"三个臭皮匠中的两个，另一个呢？" 她问道，声音让篮球明星心花怒放。

Kensuke backed away from his love-struck friend and answered. "We're here to see him since he hasn't been in school for a while. What about you?" he asked, pulling his fluttering friend down from his cloud.  
"健介从陷入爱河的朋友身边退开，回答道："我们来找他，因为他已经有一段时间没来学校了。你呢？" 他问着，把朋友从云端拉回现实。

She began walking next to them, smiling back at Toji. "I'm here to see Asuka."  
她开始和他们并肩行走，对东治回以微笑。"我来见明日香。

They reached the door of the Katsuragi residence and turned to each other." "Why'd you stop here?"" they asked at the same time and when they received no answer from one another, Hikari rang the doorbell.  
他们来到了葛城家的门前，相互对视。“你为什么停在这里？”他们同时问道，见彼此没有回应，光按响了门铃。

A few seconds after she rang it, the voice box answered with a unison voice of what sounded like Shinji and Asuka. "Coming." they didn't sound too happy either. The door opened a moment after that and Hikari wasn't happy with what she saw, nor Toji and Kensuke.  
她按响门铃几秒后，对讲机里传来了听起来像是真嗣和明日香齐声的回答：“来了。”他们的语气也显得不太高兴。片刻之后，门打开了，而光、东治和健介所见到的景象同样令他们感到不悦。

"You're doing it again. You're dressing like her!" Kensuke pointed at Shinji who wore a revealing pair of spandex shorts and a short T-shirt with music notes on it. Asuka was dressed similar, her shirt pink instead of blue.  
"你又在这样了。你又在打扮得像她一样！" 健介指着穿着一条暴露的紧身短裤和一件印有音符的短袖 T 恤的真嗣。明日香也穿着类似的衣服，只是她的 T 恤是粉色的而不是蓝色。

*~*FLASHBACK*~* *~*闪回*~*

Filming his surroundings, Kensuke smiled at all the aircrafts and boats around the dock at which they got off at. When they heard a door slam, he and Toji looked up to see Asuka coming down the escalator, looking very smug and Shinji behind her, trying to cover himself.  
拍摄着四周，健介对着码头周围众多的飞机和船只微笑。当听到一声关门声时，他和东治抬头看到明日香从自动扶梯上下来，一副洋洋得意的样子，而身后的真嗣则试图遮掩自己。

Laughing, Kensuke pointed his camera at the Third Child, grinning. "Wow Shinji, looking good!"  
健介笑着将相机对准第三适格者，咧嘴笑道：“哇，真嗣，看起来不错嘛！”

Toji joined in, chuckling. "Yeah, never thought you'd look that good in red before!" he whistled and would have continued if only Asuka hadn't hit him on the back of the head and Misato hitting Kensuke, shutting them up.  
东治也加入了，轻声笑着。“是啊，从没想过你穿红色会这么好看！”他吹了声口哨，如果不是明日香在他后脑勺上拍了一下，还有美里给了健介一击，让他们闭嘴，他还会继续说下去。

*~*END OF FLASHBACK*~* (A/N: Woot, woot! My first flash back!)  
*~*回忆结束*~*（作者注：哇哦，哇哦！我的第一个回忆片段！）

""It's all Misato's fault. We have to eat, sleep and breathe together."" They said in unison again and a vein popped on Hikari's forehead.  
""这都是美里的错。我们不得不一起吃饭、睡觉、呼吸。""他们异口同声地说，这时光里的额头上冒出了一根青筋。

"That's disgusting! You're living in sin!" she accused, stepping back from the two.  
"太恶心了！你们这是在犯罪！" 她指责道，从两人身边退后一步。

Shinji looked down, ashamed and Asuka turned red in embarrassment. ""No, it's not like that!""  
真嗣低下头，感到羞愧，而明日香则尴尬得满脸通红。""不，不是那样的！"

The pig-tailed girl looked up at them again. "And just what is it like?" before they could answer, she turned around and buried her face in Toji's chest who grinned stupidly, wrapping his arms around her in a loose hug.  
那位扎着马尾的女孩再次抬头看向他们。"那到底是怎样？" 在他们回答之前，她转过身，将脸埋进东治的胸膛，后者傻笑着，用松松的拥抱环绕住她。

"Hey there guys!" the three looked up to find Misato along with classmate, Ayanami Rei. The Captain smiled and waved at them.  
"嘿，大家好！" 三人抬头一看，发现是葛城美里和同学绫波丽。美里队长微笑着向他们挥手。

When he recovered from his happiness, Toji thumbed a finger at the EVA pilots. "Um, care to explain this?"  
从喜悦中回过神来，东治用手指了指 EVA 驾驶员们，问道："呃，能解释一下这是怎么回事吗？"

~*~

"Haha, you should have said that before, Shinji!" Toji laughed, looking over at Hikari who was staring at PenPen (A/N: *insert girlish squeal here* PENPEN! *does PenPen dance* I love PenPen, I love PenPen!) who stared right back. He then looked over at his friend and the devil girl who were following the steps on a pad on the floor, trying to be synchronized and doing extremely badly.  
哈哈，真嗣，你早该这么说了！" 东治笑着，看向盯着企鹅彭彭（作者注：*此处插入少女尖叫*彭彭！*跳彭彭舞*我爱彭彭，我爱彭彭！）的明日香，后者也回望着他。随后，他的目光转向了正在地板上的垫子上努力同步步伐，却做得一塌糊涂的朋友和那个恶魔女孩。

"Arg! This is hopeless!" Asuka threw her headphones on the floor after Shinji had fallen, causing their routine to fail.  
"啊！这毫无希望！" 在真嗣摔倒导致他们的常规动作失败后，明日香气愤地将耳机扔到了地上。

Misato grinned. "So, are you giving up?" she asked slyly.  
美里咧嘴一笑，“那么，你要放弃了吗？”她狡黠地问道。

Asuka smirked right back, placing her hands on her hips. "Well, it's not like you have anyone else, now is it?"  
明日香也回以一抹坏笑，双手叉腰道：“哼，反正你现在也没别人了，不是吗？”

The purple-haired woman closed her eyes, still smiling. "Rei?"  
紫发女子闭上双眼，依旧微笑着。“零？”

The albino looked up from her book that she was reading. "Yes, Captain?"  
那位白化病患者从正在阅读的书中抬起头来。“是的，船长？”

Misato smiled at her. "Why don't you give it a try?"  
碇真嗣对她微笑道：“你为什么不试试看呢？”

"Yes Miss." She stood up and walked over to the pad, picking up the pair of headphones that Asuka had thrown away and placing them on her head. Shinji looked over at her, unsure then back to the front as the music started. They began dancing, perfectly in sync.  
"好的，小姐。" 她站起身，走向垫子，捡起明日香丢弃的那副耳机戴在头上。真嗣看了她一眼，有些不确定，随后又将目光转回前方，音乐响起。他们开始跳舞，动作完美同步。

Asuka watched in horror. 'No, this can't be happening! This is supposed to be my big break!' she watched as Shinji and Rei followed the steps perfectly together, not missing or going out of sync with one another. "No, no, no..." she stalked over to the door, opening it. "I hate this!" she exclaimed before slamming it shut behind her.  
明日香惊恐地看着。'不，这不可能发生！这应该是我的大好机会！' 她看着真嗣和绫波完美地同步着步伐，没有错过任何一个节拍或失去同步。'不，不，不...' 她走向门口，打开门。'我讨厌这样！' 她喊道，然后砰地一声关上了门。

Shinji stared after her, feeling the pang of guilt rise in his throat.  
真嗣目送她离去，喉咙里涌起一阵内疚的刺痛。

Standing up with PenPen in her arms, Hikari faced Shinji. "Shinji, go! Go apologize, you hurt her feelings!"  
抱着 PenPen 站起来，光面对着真嗣。“真嗣，快去！去道歉，你伤了她的心！”

The man just blinked a few times before running to the door, slipping his shoes on before leaving to race after the redhead.  
那男子眨了几下眼，随即跑向门口，匆匆穿上鞋子便追了出去，追赶那位红发女孩。

~*~

He found her in a department store not far from their apartment, looking at some drinks. He walked up to her and when he noticed that she didn't see him, placed a hand on her shoulder, causing her to jump in surprise. She whirled around quickly, not expecting to see him there. She went so fast that she accidentally whacked her forehead against Shinji's, both wincing at the pain.  
他在离公寓不远的百货公司找到了她，她正在看一些饮料。他走近她，注意到她没看见自己，便将手放在她肩上，让她吓了一跳。她迅速转身，没想到会在这里见到他。转得太快，不小心额头撞上了真嗣的额头，两人都痛得皱起了眉头。

"Sorry. Not just for that but for what I did back there." She picked a couple cans out of the refrigerator. Without facing him she continued. "I think Wonder girl should just take my place, I'd just screw up anyway..." she brought the cans to the man at the cash who ran them through his computer.  
“对不起。不仅是因为那个，还有我之前做的事。”她从冰箱里挑了几罐饮料。没有面对他，她继续说道：“我想神奇女孩应该取代我的位置，反正我只会搞砸……”她把饮料递给收银台的男子，他通过电脑扫描了它们。

"Asuka, don't say that. You're a great fighter. It's me that's bad." He followed her out of the store after she paid for her drinks.  
明日香，别这么说。你是个出色的战士。是我不好。" 在她付完饮料钱后，他跟着她走出了商店。

She turned around and glared at him once they were out of the store. "If it was just you, then why were you able to do it with Ayanami? Hmm?" her features softened and she lowered her head. "I'm just going to let her take over on this one." She turned back around and prepared to leave but was stopped by Shinji grabbing her arm. She turned around and saw his determined face staring at her.  
一出店门，她便转身瞪着他，质问道：“如果只是你，那为什么你能和绫波一起做到？嗯？”她的神情渐渐柔和，低下头来，“这次就让她来主导吧。”她转过身准备离开，却被真嗣抓住了手臂。她回过头，迎上了他坚定的目光。

"I don't want to do it with her." He smiled at her. "I want to do this with you." He spoke softly and her heart missed a beat.  
“我不想和她一起做这件事。”他朝她微笑，“我想和你一起做。”他轻声说道，她的心漏跳了一拍。

After a minute of decision making, she looked up at him and smiled back. "I'll do it. For you Shinji."  
经过一分钟的抉择，她抬头望向他，回以微笑：“我愿意做，为了你，真嗣。”

Author's Notes: Aw...fluff! Not much Shinji/Asuka but tons of Toji/Hikari! I'm so proud of myself. I think I got Hikari's last name right but if it's wrong, please tell me. And be sure to check out my other NGE fic, ''What if...' Kaji Hadn't Died' which came to an end a few days ago!

### Chapter 7: Israfel Attacks Part III: The Battle Won Fluff included!
The few days together seemed to be a blur to Ikari Shinji as he and his lovely co-pilot trained for their upcoming battle against the angel. Nights were spent talking about the things they liked, disliked and so on while during the days, they would practice their routine, which was coming along a lot better. Then the worst possible scenario happened to Shinji.  
与心爱的副驾驶员一起度过的那几天，对碇真嗣来说仿佛一片模糊。他们正为即将到来的天使之战进行训练。夜晚，他们谈论着各自喜欢和不喜欢的事物，而白天则练习着日益熟练的日常。然而，最糟糕的情况降临到了真嗣身上。

He and his female counterpart were left alone for the night...no supervision...no Misato...alone...  
他和他的女性搭档被留下来单独过夜...没有监管...没有美里...只有他们俩...

Shinji sweated nervously as he heard the Soryu Asuka Langley singing and a splash of water every so often. He directed all his will power towards the television in front of him instead of her sweet voice radiating from the bathroom but the images from the idiot box never got to his brain since it was on hiatus (A/N: My new word!^_^). He sighed and ran a hand through his dark hair, slinking from the couch to the floor with a loud 'thud!'. She was always on his mind lately and he knew that his mild infatuation had grown stronger lately. With another sigh he began banging his head against the back of the couch, hoping that a little jump-start would fix his brain problems. He was too into his head banging (A/N: heh...) that he never noticed a certain redhead appear from the bathroom and was now standing next to him, clad only in a pink towel and another one wrapped around her hair to soak some of the water from it.  
听到惣流·明日香·兰格雷在浴室里唱歌，偶尔还伴随着水花声，真嗣紧张得直冒汗。他竭力将注意力集中在面前的电视机上，而不是从浴室传来的她那甜美的声音，但电视上的画面却始终无法进入他的大脑，因为他的思绪已经暂停了（A/N：我的新词！^_^）。他叹了口气，用手捋了捋乌黑的头发，从沙发上滑落到地板，发出一声巨响。最近，她总是在他的脑海中挥之不去，他知道自己的轻微迷恋已经变得更加强烈。又叹了口气，他开始用头撞击沙发的背面，希望这种小小的刺激能解决他的思维问题。他太专注于撞头（A/N：呵呵...），以至于没有注意到某个红发女孩已经从浴室出来，现在正站在他旁边，身上只裹着一条粉色毛巾，另一条则缠在头上，以吸走一些水分。

"What are you doing, dummkopf?" Shinji's ears perked up and he looked up at Asuka, surprised to see her grinning, and laughed nervously.  
“你在做什么，笨蛋？”真嗣的耳朵竖了起来，抬头看向明日香，惊讶地发现她正咧嘴笑着，他紧张地笑了笑。

"Um...nothing, I was just trying to...uh...think!" 'That...was lame.' He thought as she raised a sleek eyebrow at him but shrugged it off.  
“呃...没什么，我只是在试着...嗯...思考！”他心想，‘这...太逊了。’她挑起了一道修长的眉毛，但随即耸了耸肩，没放在心上。

"When are you going to bed?" she called from their bedroom, rustling being heard from the room and Shinji assumed she was looking for her pajamas.  
"你什么时候睡觉？" 她从卧室里喊道，房间里传来窸窸窣窣的声音，真嗣猜想她正在找睡衣。

He turned back to look at the TV, which now held a commercial of a woman who appeared to be naked and screaming in ecstasy while shampooing her hair. Shinji blushed profusely and fumbled with the remote before catching it and pressing the off button. He sighed and the regular color of his face returned. "I don't know yet, I was thinking of going to the movie store around the corner and renting some movies maybe." He picked himself up off the floor just as Asuka emerged from the room, dressed in a large, low cut, yellow T-shirt and blue short-shorts.  
他转头看向电视，屏幕上正播放着一个广告，一位看似裸体的女子在洗头时尖叫着表现出极度的快感。真嗣满脸通红，手忙脚乱地抓起遥控器，好不容易才按下关机键。他叹了口气，脸色逐渐恢复正常。"我还没决定呢，我在想或许可以去拐角处的影碟店租几部电影。" 他刚从地上站起来，明日香就从房间里走了出来，穿着一件宽松的低领黄色 T 恤和蓝色短裤。

She walked over to him and took the remote from his hands as he stared open- mouthed at her and she smirked. "Like what you see?" she asked and brought at hand up to his chin, using her index finger to push his jaw up, promptly closing his mouth. She smiled deviously at him and flopped onto the couch, amused as he stared at where she was just a few minutes ago. "Pick up a couple and I'll watch them with you, is that okay?" when she didn't receive an answer, she lifted her right foot and poked him in the arm with her sock- covered foot.  
她走过去，从他手中拿过遥控器，而他则目瞪口呆地看着她，她得意地笑了。“喜欢你看到的吗？”她问道，伸手抬起他的下巴，用食指轻轻推上，合上了他的嘴。她狡黠地对他笑了笑，然后倒在沙发上，看着他盯着她刚才所在的位置，感到十分有趣。“挑几部片子，我陪你一起看，怎么样？”见他没有回应，她抬起右脚，用穿着袜子的脚尖轻轻戳了戳他的手臂。

When he finally realized that the poking in his arm wouldn't stop, he looked at the limb and found a foot probing the muscles. He followed the foot to slender legs that ran up to thighs, hidden from his eyes by blue shorts, then up a slender, fit body to the beautiful face of his crush. He jumped back, startled at how fast she moved and bumped into the TV, nearly making it fall. He stuttered a moment (A/N: you know when Asuka first goes to his school and she says Gutten Morgen to him and he goes Gngngh or something like that. Well that what he did.) before composing himself enough to stand without support from the TV. "W-what did you say, Asuka?"  
当他终于意识到手臂上的戳动不会停止时，他看向那只手臂，发现一只脚正在探触他的肌肉。他顺着脚望向修长的双腿，再往上是被蓝色短裤遮住的大腿，然后是纤细健美的身躯，最后是他暗恋对象那美丽的脸庞。他吓了一跳，急忙后退，撞到了电视，差点让它倒下。他结巴了一会儿（作者注：你知道当明日香第一次去他学校时，她对他说 Gutten Morgen，而他发出 Gngngh 之类的声音。他就是那样。），然后才勉强站稳，不再依靠电视支撑。“你、你刚才说什么，明日香？”

She giggled at him before bringing the foot that she had used for poking him with down and crossing it over her other one, her arms thrown over the back of the couch to leave her in a very seductive position in the eyes of The Third Child. "I asked you if it was alright if I could watch the movies you're going to rent with you." She smiled softly at him and he felt himself blush lightly.  
她对他咯咯笑了起来，随后将用来戳他的那只脚放下，交叉在另一只脚上，双臂搭在沙发背上，以一种在第三适格者眼中极具诱惑的姿势坐着。“我问过你，我是否可以和你一起看你打算租的电影。”她温柔地对他微笑，他感到自己的脸颊微微泛红。

He brushed off some imaginary dust to avert his eyes from her and cleared his constricting throat. "Um...sure. Got anything in mind?"  
他假装拂去一些不存在的灰尘，以避开她的目光，清了清紧绷的喉咙。“嗯……当然可以。有什么特别想看的吗？”

She shook her head and lazily covered her mouth as she yawned. "Nope. Just surprise me."  
她摇了摇头，懒洋洋地捂住嘴打了个哈欠。“没有。就给我个惊喜吧。”

~*~

And surprise her he did. She was immensely shocked when he had gotten a romance movie and a horror movie. She thought he was the type of guy to love action and sit on the edge of his seat but, then again, he may have just done it for her. At that thought, she smiled sweetly at the figure that was popping the video in the player. She watched him stand up, smiling proudly at the box that now showed them the previews and turned to her, smiling back at her. He picked a bowl of popcorn off the top of the TV and turned the lights off then walked over and sat beside her on the couch. He placed the bowl of popcorn in his lap, fast-forwarding the previews to the movie and nearly jumped out of his socks when the German girl leaned over and grabbed a handful of popcorn with one hand and the remote with the other, pausing the movie.  
他确实让她感到惊喜。当他拿回一部爱情电影和一部恐怖电影时，她感到非常震惊。她以为他是那种喜欢动作片、坐在座位边缘的人，但转念一想，他这么做可能只是为了她。想到这里，她对着那个正在往播放器里放录像带的身影甜甜地笑了。她看着他站起来，对着现在播放着预告片的盒子自豪地微笑，然后转向她，也对她报以微笑。他从电视机顶上拿起一碗爆米花，关掉灯，然后走过来坐在她旁边的沙发上。他把爆米花碗放在腿上，快进预告片到电影开始，当那个德国女孩侧身过来，一手抓了一把爆米花，另一手拿着遥控器暂停电影时，他差点从袜子里跳出来。

She turned to him and smiled at his shocked face. "Why don't you go get changed, that way when we're finished, we can go to bed right away." She reasoned with him and placed a piece of popcorn in her mouth.  
她转向他，对着他那惊讶的脸微笑。“你为什么不先去换衣服，这样我们看完电影后，就可以直接去睡觉了。”她边说边往嘴里放了一块爆米花，以此来说服他。

He nodded wordlessly and left to his room to change. When he got back, he found her lying down on the couch, her feet dangling off one side of the couch and her head sideways on a pillow. He walked over to her and placed his hands on his hips, frowning playfully down at her. "And where am I supposed to sit?"  
他默默地点了点头，回房间换衣服去了。回来时，发现她已经躺在沙发上，双脚悬在沙发的一侧，头歪在枕头上。他走过去，双手叉腰，带着戏谑的皱眉低头看着她。“那我该坐哪儿呢？”

She merely lifted the top part of her body and removed the pillow, patting the space where her head once laid.  
她只是抬起上半身，拿开枕头，拍了拍她头曾经所在的位置。

Totally unaware of her plan, Shinji sat down on the couch she gave him and was surprised when she placed the pillow on his lap and her head on the pillow. His back shot up straight and she un-paused the movie, unaware of his shock. Five minutes into the movie, he finally loosened up and sighed, his heart returning to its normal pace. He stared down at the beautiful girl in his lap before raising an uncertain hand and running in through her vibrant hair. She stiffened at the sudden contact for a moment but then relaxed and snuggled into his lap further. His smile grew as he looked up at the screen, his hand continuing its loving caress.  
完全不知道她的计划，真嗣坐在她让出的沙发上，当她把枕头放在他腿上，头枕在枕头上时，他感到惊讶。他的背立刻挺直，而她则继续播放电影，没有察觉到他的震惊。电影开始五分钟后，他终于放松下来，叹了口气，心跳恢复了正常。他低头看着腿上美丽的女孩，然后举起一只不确定的手，穿过她那充满活力的头发。她因突然的接触而僵硬了一会儿，但随后放松下来，更深地依偎进他的怀里。他抬头看着屏幕，笑容扩大，手继续温柔地抚摸着。

"Mph! No, not here, someone might see us!" a voice rang out in one of the many elevators of NERV.  
"呣！不，不能在这里，可能会被人看见！" 一个声音在 NERV 众多电梯中的一部里响起。

"No one's around, who'll see us?" a flirty masculine voice replied.  
"周围没人，谁会看见我们呢？"一个带着挑逗意味的男声回应道。

"Someone!" Captain Katsuragi Misato tried to shove the figure away from her but deep down she knew she wasn't trying with all her might.  
"有人！"葛城美里上尉试图将那身影从自己身边推开，但内心深处她知道自己并未尽全力。

Kaji Ryouji didn't answer to this, at least verbally that is. Instead, he firmly clamped his mouth over hers, quieting her refusals.  
加治良治对此没有回答，至少没有口头上的回应。相反，他坚定地将自己的嘴唇紧贴在她的唇上，使她的拒绝声戛然而止。

The woman moaned and closed her eyes for a moment then opened them slightly to watch the counter at the top of the doorway tick off the floors. 'Please hurry, I don't think I'll last much longer!' As if answering her pleas, the elevator 'dinged' and she backed away from Ryouji and out of the elevator, tucking in her shirt while fixing her hair. "Don't ever do that again, Kaji. It's over between us, has been for a long time." She scorned him.  
女子呻吟一声，闭上眼睛片刻，然后微微睁开，注视着门框顶部的计数器逐层递减。'请快点，我觉得我坚持不了多久了！'仿佛回应她的恳求，电梯'叮'的一声响起，她从良治身边退开，走出电梯，边整理头发边塞好衬衫。'加治，以后别再这样了。我们之间早就结束了。'她轻蔑地对他说。

The longhaired man grinned boyishly at her. "But your lips didn't complain. Tell me Katsuragi, which should I trust, your lips...or your words?" before she could answer, the elevator 'dinged' again and the doors closed on him as he bowed to her, still grinning.  
长发男子对她露出了孩子气的笑容。'但你的嘴唇并没有抱怨。告诉我，葛城，我应该相信你的嘴唇...还是你的话？'在她能回答之前，电梯再次'叮'了一声，门在他向她鞠躬并依旧微笑时关闭了。

She glared at the steel doors in front of her, panting slightly. How dare he? How dare he bring forth the feelings she had long ago buried away, at what she had hoped for good.  
她怒视着面前的钢门，微微喘息。他怎么敢？他怎么敢唤起她早已深埋心底的情感，那些她曾希望永远尘封的渴望。

'But you still love him...'  
'但你仍然爱着他...'

And with that thought, she threw the documents she had been holding at the doors along with an angry cry.  
想到这里，她将手中的文件狠狠地朝门扔去，伴随着一声愤怒的呼喊。

~*~

"Here you go." Misato looked up to see her old time friend, Akagi Ritsuko beside her as she placed a cup of coffee on the table.  
"给你。" 碇真嗣抬头一看，发现老朋友赤木律子正站在她旁边，将一杯咖啡放在桌上。

"Thanks." The purple-haired woman picked the cup and blew into it, attempting to cool it down.  
"谢谢。"紫发女子拿起杯子，轻轻吹气，试图使其冷却。

"So, what is it? Work or a man or both?" The blonde asked as she sat down in a chair opposite of Misato.  
"那么，是什么事？工作还是男人，或者两者都有？"金发女子说着，坐在了与美里相对的椅子上。

The woman smiled somewhat. "Heh heh, something like that." She brought the cup to her lips and sipped it.  
女子微微一笑：“呵呵，差不多吧。”她将杯子举至唇边，轻啜了一口。

"Hm...still in love huh?" Ritsuko was answered by Misato spilling the contents of her mouth onto the floor.  
"嗯...还是那么爱啊？" 丽莎的回答是，美里将嘴里的东西全吐到了地板上。

"Phf! That's ridiculous! Who'd want that over-sexed idiot anyway?!" Misato yelled, whipping her mouth with the sleeve of her red jacket.  
"噗！太荒唐了！谁会要那个性欲过剩的白痴啊？！" 葛城美里大声喊道，用她红色夹克的袖子擦了擦嘴。

"I meant he may still love you. Did I scare you?" The doctor smirked at her, leaning back in her chair.  
"我的意思是，他可能仍然爱着你。我吓到你了吗？" 医生朝她咧嘴一笑，靠回椅背上。

Misato glared at her. "OoOoh I'll show you scary..." she mumbled before sipping her coffee again.  
碇真嗣瞪着她。“哦哦哦，我会让你见识什么叫可怕……”她嘟囔着，再次啜饮了一口咖啡。

"You're only proving my hypotheses. Why don't you just got with your feelings?"  
你只是在证实我的假设。为什么不直接顺从你的感觉呢？

Misato sighed and her head flopped back. "I may have been just a kid but getting together with him was the dumbest thing I ever did." She took a swing of coffee before placing it back onto the dark wood table. "Aw well, better get back to work. Tomorrow's D-day you know."  
葛城美里叹了口气，头无力地向后仰去。“我那时虽然只是个孩子，但和他在一起是我做过的最愚蠢的事。”她喝了一口咖啡，然后将其放回深色木桌上。“唉，还是回去工作吧。你知道的，明天就是决战日了。”

"All system's go. EVAs are ready." Ibuki Maya called from her station at the controls to the Commanders present and Captain Katsuragi.  
“一切系统就绪。EVA 机体准备完毕。”伊吹摩耶从控制台向在场的指挥官们及葛城美里上尉报告道。

"Shinji, Asuka! You ready?" Misato asked over the COM link with the two pilots.  
"真嗣，明日香！准备好了吗？" 美里通过通讯链接向两位驾驶员问道。

"Roger!" they answered simultaneously.  
"收到！" 他们异口同声地回答。

Asuka turned to the COM link established with Shinji and smirked. "Just remember the moves, Shinji."  
明日香转向与真嗣建立的通讯链接，嘴角勾起一抹笑意。"记住动作，真嗣。"

The pilot of Unit-01 nodded at her. "We'll be done in sixty-two seconds (A/N: is that right?)." the two EVAs were launched and the count down had begun. When they reached the top, the sides of two large buildings opened up to reveal their rifles, which they quickly grabbed. They split up, running on either side of the Angel, shooting away until Asuka was close enough and grabbed her Progressive Knife, cutting the Angel into two parts which regenerated itself into two right away. Units 01 and 02 met up on the other side of the Angels and back flipped many times, evading the attacks of the enemy, and landed on a small platform, pressing a switch which activated a shield. The barrier gave them a moment to gain their breath but only a moment because the steel was melted seconds later by the Angels. The fighters rolled out of the way as one of the Angels cut the shield in half, exposing them.  
零号机驾驶员向她点头示意：“我们将在六十二秒内完成（A/N：是这样吗？）。”两台 EVA 随即发射升空，倒计时开始。当它们抵达顶部时，两侧的大型建筑物敞开，露出里面的步枪，它们迅速抓起武器。两台 EVA 分头行动，围绕使徒两侧奔跑射击，直至明日香接近并抽出她的高振动粒子刀，将使徒一分为二，后者立即再生为两个个体。零号机与二号机在使徒另一侧汇合，连续后空翻躲避攻击，最终落在一个小平台上，按下开关激活护盾。屏障为他们争取了片刻喘息之机，但转瞬即逝，因为使徒很快便将钢制护盾熔化。战斗员们翻滚躲避，其中一名使徒将护盾劈成两半，使他们暴露无遗。

Shinji turned to look at Asuka's window just as she turned to him and they smirked at each other. With a quick nod, their EVAs charged at the two Angels. An uppercut to where the gut would be and a high kick later, the Angels re-merged into one and the pilots leapt into the air and came crashing down upon the Angel, right where it's red orb laid (A/N: What's that called?) and the Angel slid backwards from the force all the way to the mountains.  
真嗣转头望向明日香所在的窗口，恰好她也转头看向他，两人相视一笑。随即，他们迅速点头示意，两台 EVA 向着两只天使发起冲锋。一记直击腹部的上勾拳和一记高踢腿之后，两只天使重新融合为一体。两位驾驶员随即跃入空中，重重地砸向天使，正中其红色核心所在（作者注：那东西叫什么来着？）。受到这股冲击力，天使被击退至远处的山脉之中。

From NERV headquarters, Misato and the rest watched with anxious eyes, trying to see through the smoke of the explosion. When the smoke cleared enough, a picture of Unit-02 on top of 01 appeared. Captain Misato sweatdropped at what looked like Shinji's EVA holding the other.  
在 NERV 总部，美里和其他人焦急地注视着，试图透过爆炸产生的烟雾看清楚情况。当烟雾散去到足以辨认时，出现了零号机压在初号机上的画面。美里上尉见状不禁汗颜，看起来像是真嗣的 EVA 正抱着另一台。

"Both EVAs are okay." Maya's voice broke the silence.  
"两台 EVA 都没事。" 玛雅的声音打破了沉默。

Ritsuko giggled as Misato rubbed her temples. "Guess baby-sitting isn't like you thought, ne Misato?"  
律子咯咯笑着，看着美里揉着太阳穴。“看来照看孩子并不像你想象的那样，对吧，美里？”

### Chapter 8: Their First wannabe Date
"AAHH! This isn't fair! Why do we have to stay here when Hikari and the stooges get to go to Okinawa?! WWWHHHYYY!?"  
啊啊啊！这不公平！为什么光和那帮家伙可以去冲绳，而我们却得留在这里？！为什么啊！？

Citizens passing by the trio stopped then back away from the fuming redhead as the boy waved apologetically at them. As they regained their composure and began walking away again, Ikari Shinji turned around to his co-pilot and tried calming her down.  
路过的市民看到这三人组后，纷纷避开那位怒气冲冲的红发少女，男孩则向他们歉意地挥手。当他们恢复镇定再次离开时，碇真嗣转向他的副驾驶员，试图让她平静下来。

"Asuka...it's not that big of a deal. I mean, what are they going to do that we can't do here?" Only after the words came from his mouth did he wish they could be stuffed back in or erased or anything else to stop them from reaching her ears.  
"明日香……这没什么大不了的。我是说，他们去那里能做什么，我们在这里就不能做吗？" 话一出口，真嗣就后悔了，恨不得能把话塞回去，或者抹掉，只要不让它们传到她的耳朵里。

Soryu Asuka Langley turned around and glared furiously at the male before her. "What can they do there that we can't do here, you ask? Hm, let me see! Diving, eating Okinawa treats, MISSING SCHOOL! EVERYTHING!" she exclaimed, many nerves popping out from her forehead. "And while they're there doing that, we're here stuck either fighting or doing homework! NOT FAIR!" She stopped from her yelling so she was able to wail instead, sinking to her knees.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷转过身来，怒气冲冲地瞪着面前的男生。“你说他们在那里能做什么我们在这里不能做的？哼，让我想想！潜水、吃冲绳小吃、逃学！样样都行！”她大声说道，额头上青筋暴起。“而他们在那里逍遥自在，我们却在这里要么战斗要么做作业！太不公平了！”她停止了吼叫，转而哀嚎起来，跪倒在地。

Shinji sweated nervously. Being stuck in the street with broken down woman was not his way of having fun, at all. He kneeled next to her, placing a hand on her shoulder. "Hey, sorry Asuka, I didn't mean to make you any more upset but I'm just saying that we could have as much fun here. How about this: we could go to NERV HQ and borrow their pool for a while then I'll treat you to some real Japanese food, deal?" he smiled hopefully, watching her tears stop.  
真嗣紧张得直冒汗。和一个情绪崩溃的女孩困在街上，绝不是他想要的娱乐方式。他跪在她旁边，把手放在她的肩上。“嘿，对不起，明日香，我不是故意让你更难过，只是想说我们在这里也能玩得很开心。这样吧：我们去 NERV 总部借用他们的泳池一会儿，然后我请你吃正宗的日本料理，怎么样？”他满怀希望地笑着，看着她的泪水止住了。

Her bottom lip quivered slightly before she threw her arms around his neck. She had been looking for an excuse to do this for some time, being in his arms just felt so right, so comforting. She buried her face in his chest, he grip tightening as she felt his arms hesitantly wrap around her waist. "Oooo! Thank you so much, Shin-chan! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"  
她的下唇微微颤抖，随后她张开双臂紧紧抱住了他的脖子。她已经找了很久的借口想要这么做，依偎在他怀里感觉如此正确，如此安心。她将脸埋进他的胸膛，感受到他的手臂犹豫地环抱住她的腰时，她的抓握更紧了。“哦哦！太感谢你了，真嗣君！谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你！”

He felt heat rise to his face, his cheeks turning a bright red and he turned to the other girl who had just been standing there throughout the whole thing, staring into the ocean. "Ayanami, would you like to come with us?"  
他感到一股热流涌上面颊，脸颊变得通红，他转向一直站在那里，凝视着大海的另一位女孩。“绫波，你想和我们一起来吗？”

At this, Asuka stiffened visibly. She glared at nothing in particular, somewhere near the top button of Shinji's shirt. She didn't want that girl to come with them, she was hoping for it to be some sort of date for them. Once she heard the words "Thank you" come from Ayanami Rei's mouth, her scowl hardened but when she heard the words that followed, "but I must report to Commander Ikari before dinner time. Goodbye." And with that, Asuka turned around just in time to watch her turn a corner then out of sight.  
听到这话，明日香明显僵硬了。她瞪着虚空，目光落在真嗣衬衫的顶扣附近。她不希望那个女孩跟他们一起来，她本希望这是他们之间的一次约会。当她听到绫波丽说出“谢谢”时，她的眉头紧锁，但随后听到的话让她更加不悦，“但我必须在晚餐前向碇司令报告。再见。”说完，明日香转过身，正好看到她拐过街角，消失在视线之外。

Shinji shrugged his shoulders. It's not that he really wanted her to come, it was more about the fact that he didn't want her to be left out like he always used to be. Truthfully, all he wanted was to be alone with and *insert Shinji nosebleed here* maybe see her in a bikini? He shook his head. Those were the last thoughts he needed! He stood up, offering her his hand to help her up as well, which she accepted. But, to his surprise and delight, she keep a tight hold of his hand as they stood next to each other then started walking towards the Katsuragi/Ikari/Soryu apartment. Shinji blushed the whole way, obviously, as Asuka just smiled at him, enjoying his embarrassment. Once they reached the home, the separated into their separate rooms, changing into their bathing suits. The pilot to EVA- 01 was quite embarrassed about the whole idea though. 1) He was going to see his dream girl in a (hopefully) revealing bathing suit and 2) he wasn't exactly the most built guy around. Though he had a few muscles, he wasn't nearly as strong as one of his best friends, Suzuhara Toji or his newfound father figure, Kaji Ryoji. He just hoped Asuka wouldn't mind too much...He walked over to his drawer, shuffling through to find a clean shirt and, to his dismay, found none.  
真嗣耸了耸肩。并非他真的希望她来，更多的是不想让她像自己过去那样被排除在外。说实话，他内心深处只想与她独处，并*此处插入真嗣流鼻血*或许还能看到她穿比基尼的样子？他摇了摇头，告诫自己不该有这些念头。他站起身，向她伸出手以助她起身，她接受了。令他惊喜的是，她紧紧握住他的手，两人并肩站在一起，随后一同走向葛城/碇/惣流家的公寓。一路上，真嗣满脸通红，而明日香则微笑着欣赏他的窘态。到家后，他们各自回房换上泳装。作为 EVA-01 的驾驶员，真嗣对整个计划感到相当尴尬。一是因为即将看到梦中女孩穿着（希望是）性感的泳装，二是他自己并非肌肉发达之人。虽有些肌肉，但远不及好友铃原东治或新近的父辈形象加持的加持良治强壮。他只希望明日香不要太介意...他走到自己的抽屉前，翻找着想要找一件干净的衬衫，却令他失望的是，一件也没找到。

Stepping out of his room, Shinji looked around wearily and, finding no signs of Asuka around, ran towards a near by laundry basket and hoped they were clean clothes recently washed by their care-taker, Katsuragi Misato. Just as he had found one and held in up in victory, he spotted Asuka standing right in front of him and stopped right in his tracks. Dressed in a red and white, zip-up tank tiny, her choice of bathing suit couldn't have brought on a better blood rush to poor ol' Shinji (A/N: Ehehehehe! Matt, BLOOD RUSH! LOL!).  
走出房间，真嗣警惕地环顾四周，发现没有明日香的踪迹后，便冲向附近的洗衣篮，希望里面有他们的管理员葛城美里最近洗好的干净衣服。就在他找到一件并举起来庆祝时，突然发现明日香就站在他面前，顿时停下了脚步。她穿着红白相间的拉链式小背心，那身泳装的选择无疑让可怜的真嗣血脉贲张（作者注：嘿嘿嘿！Matt，血脉贲张！LOL！）。

"Looking good there, Shin-chan." She gave him a wink, smirking as a small trail of blood found its way down from his nose. She loved the reaction she received from him. And, she loved the way he looked without a shirt. True she'd seen better-looking chests on TV, in her dreams and such but he had a finally chiseled chest, the right muscles in the right places. Not too bulgy but not just skin and bone. She liked...  
“看起来不错嘛，真嗣君。”她朝他眨了眨眼，嘴角勾起一抹坏笑，因为看到他的鼻血缓缓流下。她喜欢他这样的反应，也喜欢他赤膊的样子。确实，她在电视上、梦里见过更健美的胸膛，但他的胸肌线条分明，肌肉恰到好处地分布在合适的位置。既不过于壮硕，也不只是皮包骨。她喜欢……

He suddenly became aware of his half-nakedness due to her head-to-toe look and quickly threw on the shirt he had been holding, whipping away the trickle of blood in the process. Once the shirt was on, he held a hand out to his companion, bidding her over. "Shall we go?"  
他突然意识到自己半裸的状态，因为她从头到脚的打量，急忙套上手中拿着的衬衫，顺手擦掉了流下的血迹。穿好衬衫后，他向同伴伸出手，示意她过来。“我们走吧？”

She smiled sweetly and him and instead of taking his hand, she grabbed onto his whole arm, hugging it to her body. "Yes we shall." And with that, she pulled him over towards the door, picking up a wrap-around skirt on the way out.  
她对他甜甜一笑，并没有握住他的手，而是紧紧抱住他的整条手臂，贴在自己身上。“好的，我们走。”说完，她拉着他朝门口走去，途中顺手拿起一条裹身裙。

### Chapter 9: HOHOHOHHOOHOHOHOH! YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS CHAPTER!
"Hey, Shin-chan! Watch this!" boasted the redhead as she dived gracefully into the swimming pool.  
"嘿，真嗣！看这个！"红发少女得意地说着，优雅地跃入泳池。

Ikari Shinji smiled at her, happy that he'd gotten her mind off Okinawa. Once the head of Soryu Asuka Langley popped back out of the water, a happy and refreshed look on her face, Shinji brought his hands together, a loud clapping noise echoing throughout the swimming area.  
碇真嗣对她微笑，庆幸自己让她暂时忘记了冲绳的事。当惣流·明日香·兰格雷的头再次从水中冒出，脸上带着快乐和清爽的表情时，真嗣双手合十，响亮的拍手声在泳池区域回荡。

She smiled back at him, a light blush at the praise she received from him. She swam over to the nearby ladder and climbed out of the pool. She frowned when she saw that he had gone back to typing up on the laptop that was perched upon his lap (A/N: Exactly why it's called a "lap" top). She walked over to him, standing in the way of his light, casting a shadow over his form. "Why are you here typing when you could be swimming?" she queried.  
她回以微笑，因他的赞扬而脸上泛起淡淡的红晕。她游向旁边的梯子，爬出泳池。看到他又回到笔记本电脑前打字（作者注：这就是为什么它被称为"膝上"电脑），她皱起了眉头。她走过去，站在他的光线前，投下一片阴影。"你为什么在这里打字而不是游泳？"她问道。

He stopped in his work to look up at her. "Misato found out that my grades were dropping dangerously low and said I'd HAVE to study or else she'd make me do even more chores than I already do."  
他停下手中的工作，抬头看向她。“美里发现我的成绩急剧下滑，警告我说必须得学习，否则她会让我做的家务比现在还要多。”

She sat down next to him on her towel. "What're you studying?"  
她坐在他旁边的毛巾上，问道：“你在学什么？”

"Science right now and then I got to brush up on my math." He looked at her, enjoying the way her hair stuck to the sides of her face, the suit he had thought skin tight on her before now showing him wrong.  
“现在学的是科学，之后还得复习数学。”他看着她，欣赏着她的头发贴在脸颊两侧的样子，之前觉得紧贴她肌肤的泳装，现在看来却并非如此。

She smiled at him, scooting closer so she could get a good look at the screen. She frowned in confusion at it. "What does it say?"  
她对他微笑着，挪近了一些以便能清楚地看到屏幕。她皱着眉头，显得有些困惑。“上面写着什么？”

He quirked an eyebrow at her in question. "You don't know the Kanji? The how do you do so well at school?"  
他向她挑了挑眉毛，带着疑问。“你不认识汉字吗？那你怎么在学校成绩那么好？”

She sighed, running a hand through her wet bangs. "I'm still learning them. I'm starting to understand but a few still confuse me." She looked at the screen again. "So, what's it say?"  
她叹了口气，用手拨弄着湿漉漉的刘海。“我还在学习中。开始能理解一些了，但还是有几个让我感到困惑。”她再次看向屏幕。“那么，上面到底写了什么？”

He smiled at her but frowned, reading the question for her. "It's about thermal expansion. But I don't get any of it at all." He looked at her expectantly.  
他向她微笑，但随即皱眉，读出了她的问题。“这是关于热膨胀的。但我完全搞不懂。”他期待地看着她。

She brought a finger to her lips, a thoughtful look upon her face. Shinji watched as her finger became wedged between her lips and he smiled. She blushed from the thought that entered her mind but then it was replaced by a sly smile. "How about an example?"  
她将手指放在唇边，脸上露出思索的表情。真嗣看着她的手指卡在唇间，不禁微笑。她因脑海中闪过的念头而脸红，但随即被一个狡黠的笑容取代。“举个例子怎么样？”

Completely lost to the not-so-innocent question, he asked, "Um...sure, like what?"  
完全被这个不那么单纯的问题迷惑了，他问道：“嗯……当然，比如什么？”

She leaned closer to him, so close that he could feel her breath on his own lips and a blush quickly covered his cheeks.  
她向他靠近，近到他能感受到她呼吸拂过自己的唇，脸颊迅速染上一层红晕。

She smirked at his reaction but continued with her devious plan. "When most things get hot, they expand. So..." she covered his left hand with her right. "If I were to kiss you right now, would your lips expand?" she asked huskily.  
她对他的反应露出一丝狡黠的笑，继续执行她的诡计。“大多数东西受热时都会膨胀。所以……”她用右手覆盖住他的左手。“如果我现在吻你，你的嘴唇会膨胀吗？”她声音低沉地问道。

He blushed fiercely, stuttering out. "Um...I-I don't r-really know..." he whispered but she heard anyways.  
他满脸通红，结结巴巴地说：“呃……我-我不太知道……”他轻声细语，但她还是听见了。

She smirked again. "Want to find out?"  
她再次挑眉，“想试试吗？”

And then, like a light illumination the dark corners of Shinji's mind, he grinned back at her sexily. "I'd love to." And he leaned forward, closing the inch or two that held them apart and his lips covered hers.  
随后，仿佛一道光照亮了真嗣脑海中的黑暗角落，他性感地对她回以微笑，“我很愿意。”他倾身向前，缩短了彼此间那一两英寸的距离，双唇覆盖上了她的。

Her eyes widened somewhat but then closed, reveling in the feeling of his lips on hers. After they both regained some of the conscious, Asuka began to move her lips, caressing his over and over again. Then, Shinji did something so out of character it was scary. He let his tongue roll from his mouth and let it touch her lips lightly, sending a wave of shock yet pleasant surprise course throughout both of their bodies. She complied with him, opening her mouth just enough for his tongue to enter her mouth but also to keep their lips together still. She moaned lightly as his tongue danced with hers. After a few moments, they pulled apart, gasping for air.  
她的眼睛微微睁大，随即闭上，沉浸在他唇瓣的触感中。当两人稍稍恢复意识后，明日香开始移动她的唇，一遍遍地轻抚他的。接着，真嗣做出了一件出乎意料到令人害怕的举动。他让舌头从口中滑出，轻轻触碰她的唇，一股既震惊又愉悦的惊喜感在两人身体中蔓延开来。她顺从了他，微微张开嘴，既让他的舌头得以进入，又保持了唇瓣的相贴。随着他的舌头与她的共舞，她轻声呻吟。片刻后，他们分开，急促地喘息着。

Once Asuka had filled up her lungs enough, she smiled softly at him, her left hand going to his lips. "I think that proved that theory." She whispered just loud enough for him to hear her.  
当明日香充分填满她的肺部后，她温柔地对他微笑，左手轻抚他的唇。“我想这证明了那个理论。”她低声说道，声音刚好够他听见。

He made a sound of approval, somewhere between a moan and a whimper, his eyes still closed as he enjoyed the feeling of her cool fingers on his burning lips. He opened his eyes and smiled back at her and was about to lean in to kiss her again but was interrupted as the red light went off, signaling the arrival of an unidentified object close by. The pulled apart and looked at the red light for a second before looking at each other and smiling sadly.  
他发出一种介于呻吟和啜泣之间的声音表示赞同，眼睛依旧闭着，享受着她冰凉的手指触碰他滚烫的嘴唇的感觉。他睁开眼，回以微笑，正要再次倾身吻她，却被突然熄灭的红灯打断，这标志着附近出现了不明物体。他们分开，盯着红灯看了一秒，然后相视而笑，带着一丝哀伤。

"We'll finish this some other time, okay?" Asuka asked as he helped her up from the ground.  
“我们改天再继续这个，好吗？”明日香问道，他正帮她从地上站起来。

He nodded, a blush covering his cheeks, looking forward to the next time that they're alone again. "Let's go kick some Angel butt!"  
他点了点头，双颊泛起红晕，期待着下一次他们再次独处的时刻。“走吧，去踢那些天使的屁股！”

Author's Notes: Yah, I know it was probably shorter than the last but it was a freebee type of chapter, just some fluff. OooOOooo, the thermal expansion part of the series is my favorite, second only to PENPEN!  
作者的话：是的，我知道这章可能比上一章短，但这章是免费赠送的类型，只是一些轻松内容。哦哦哦，系列中的热膨胀部分是我最喜欢的，仅次于 PENPEN！
