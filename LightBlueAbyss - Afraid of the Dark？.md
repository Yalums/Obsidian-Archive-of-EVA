"Are you scared of the dark?" Asuka's voice cut through the darkness. I could feel the sheets rustle as she moved to become more comfortable. She never seems to be comfortable with the way things are. I lay there for a moment, back to back with Asuka. I look out the window to see what stars may be visible, but the city lights of Tokyo-3 are too bright to let any sort of natural light through.  
“你怕黑吗？”明日香的声音划破了黑暗。我能感觉到床单随着她调整姿势而沙沙作响，她似乎总是对现状感到不自在。我躺在那里，背对着背与明日香。我望向窗外，试图寻找可能可见的星星，但第三新东京市的灯光太过明亮，无法让任何自然光线透进来。

"Are you?" repeating her question, speaking softly. "Why would I be?" I replied.  
"你呢？" 我重复她的问题，轻声说道。"我为什么会有事？" 我回答道。

"You're still wide awake. Don't tell me your having trouble sleeping?".  
"你还这么清醒。别告诉我你睡不着？

The silence overtakes the air in between each tiny moment we cease to speak.  
沉默在我们停止交谈的每一个短暂瞬间中弥漫开来。

"I just was thinking." I say. The covers move up and down ever so slightly with the pace of her breathing, it almost sounds like a lullaby. Soft and sweet, like a musical instrument that plays a tone too quiet and airy to be suited for an orchestra. With the silence gripping us once more, I almost consider to say to her my comparison about her breathing. It's no use though, she'd probably just tell me I'm and idiot, or reprimand me for listening to her breathe.  
"我只是在思考。" 我说道。被子随着她的呼吸微微起伏，那节奏几乎像一首摇篮曲。柔和而甜美，宛如一件音量过低、轻盈得不适合交响乐团的乐器。沉默再次笼罩我们，我几乎想要告诉她我对她呼吸的比喻。但这是徒劳的，她大概只会说我是个傻瓜，或者责怪我偷听她的呼吸。

"Of course you're not afraid. You know how weird it be if you were still afraid of the dark at this age?" And there it is, the reprimanding. I didn't even do anything, and she still finds something to complain about. I know she wasn't really saying I did anything wrong, but her tone makes me feel like it. Without rolling over to face me, she says "What are you thinking about?"  
"你当然不会害怕。你想过没有，如果你这个年纪还怕黑，那得多奇怪？" 看，又是责备。我什么都没做，她还是能找到抱怨的理由。我知道她并不是真的认为我做错了什么，但她的语气让我感觉如此。她没有翻身面对我，只是问道："你在想什么？"

Let's see, you're breathing, the stars, you in general. No way I'm going to say that though. All I need is time to come up with a convincing answer. I suppose the stars isn't going to make her uncomfortable. "The stars." I say, keeping the extent of my thoughts hidden.  
让我想想，你在呼吸，星星，还有你。当然，我不会把这些全说出来。我需要时间来构思一个令人信服的答案。我想，提到星星应该不会让她感到不适。"星星。" 我说，隐藏了我思绪的深度。

"The stars?" she asks with a slight undertone of confused judgment. I remember why I hate the question "What are you thinking?". It just feels so invasive. I know I'm not obligated to answer, but I have to say something, and with my mind already on the thing I don't want you to know I have to struggle to think of something else. Yet with all this, I can't help but think of her. All we ever do is fight with each other, yet I feel close to her for some reason. Maybe it was just that kiss from earlier tonight. Kissing because we were bored? It was a stupid idea. Maybe because of that my _teenage hormones_ are running wild, making me think things I wouldn't think otherwise. But I think them nonetheless, and obviously this isn't the only time I've thought this way.  
"星星？" 她带着一丝困惑的判断语气问道。我记起了为什么讨厌那个问题 "你在想什么？"。它总让人觉得被侵犯了。我知道我没有义务回答，但我必须说点什么，而我的思绪已经停留在我不想让你知道的事情上，我不得不努力去想些别的。尽管如此，我还是忍不住想起了她。我们总是在争吵，不知为何我却感觉与她很亲近。也许是因为今晚早些时候的那个吻。因为无聊而接吻？真是个愚蠢的想法。或许是因为那个吻，我的青春期荷尔蒙开始失控，让我产生了平时不会有的念头。但我确实这么想了，显然这并不是我第一次这样想。

"An answer would be nice." She says. I sigh, and prepare to speak.  
"给个答案会好些。" 她说道。我叹了口气，准备开口。

"I was just looking out the window, and I realized you can't see any stars in Tokyo-3. That's all."  
"我只是望向窗外，意识到在第三新东京市看不到任何星星。仅此而已。"

"Of course you can't, dummy." There she goes again. "There's too much light pollution. I don't see why they bother keeping them on, no one's out this time of night anyway."  
"当然你看不见，傻瓜。"她又来了。"光污染太严重了。真不明白他们为什么还要开着灯，反正这会儿外面也没人。"

"No, I guess not." I reply. I hear her shuffle again, at this rate she's not going to realize that she'll never be one hundred percent comfortable, well, with her standards at least. She lays there again, and I lay with my back against hers. I'm feeling nervous. I know we've spent plenty of nights in the same bed, but it's starting to seem like something a little different to me now. She just comes in here, says that she's staying here tonight and plops down on the other side of the bed, no explanation, no anything. Generally, we don't say a word to each other, with a few exceptions, tonight being one of them. Who knows, maybe we'll even make a habit of it.  
"嗯，我想也是。"我回答道。我又听到她动了动，照这样下去，她永远不会意识到自己永远不可能完全舒服，至少按照她的标准是这样。她再次躺下，我背对着她躺着。我感到紧张。我知道我们已经在同一张床上度过了许多夜晚，但现在开始感觉有点不同了。她就这么进来，说她今晚要留在这里，然后倒在床的另一边，没有解释，什么都没有。通常我们彼此不说话，偶尔有例外，今晚就是其中之一。谁知道呢，也许我们会养成这个习惯。

"If you tell anyone about this I'm going to hit you so hard you'll go blind." She threatens, obviously preparing to spill something to me. Before I can ask her if it's something I think I could confidently keep secret, she says it.  
"如果你敢把这事告诉别人，我就打得你眼冒金星。"她威胁道，显然准备向我透露些什么。在我能问她这是否是我能自信保守的秘密之前，她已经说了出来。

"I might be... just a little afraid." She's afraid? That's a surprise. I just assumed she wasn't afraid of anything.  
"我可能...只是有点害怕。" 她害怕？这真让人意外。我一直以为她无所畏惧。

"You're afraid of the dark?" I ask.  
"你怕黑吗？" 我问道。

"Of course not! Idiot." She snaps back. I should have known better than to speak. She continues.  
"当然不怕！笨蛋。" 她立刻反驳。我早该知道不该开口。她继续说道。

"Well, not usually at least." I feel her trembling. I never knew she could be so vulnerable, and to something so simple as a fear of the dark, too.  
"嗯，至少通常不会这样。" 我感觉到她在颤抖。我从未知道她可以如此脆弱，而且是对黑暗这样简单事物的恐惧。

"Really, it's not the dark that scares me. It's that if I stay up to long with nothing to think about, I start thinking about... unpleasant things, lets say." She sounds so sweet, so genuine. It's almost like the Asuka who always gets on everyone's nerves, has faded away. Maybe that's her shell. Maybe that's all she wants people to see, so they wont look any deeper. Yet, even if it's just a little bit, she's showing this to me, _idiot Shinji_. Am I really the closest person to her? If that's so, it says something about how close she lets herself get to people. If I'm right about all this, then we're the same that way, though I never realized it before.  
"其实，让我害怕的不是黑暗。而是如果我熬夜太久，又无事可想，就会开始想一些...不愉快的事情。" 她的声音如此甜美，如此真诚。那个总是让人烦躁的明日香仿佛消失了。也许那就是她的外壳。也许她只想让人们看到这些，以免他们看得更深。然而，即使只是一点点，她正在向我，这个笨蛋真嗣，展示这一面。我真的是她最亲近的人吗？如果是这样，这说明了她在人际关系中允许自己接近他人的程度。如果我猜得没错，那么我们在这方面是一样的，尽管我以前从未意识到。

"What are you afraid of?" She say to me. I kinda feel the same way I do when someone asks, "What are you thinking?", but part of me wants to answer truthfully. Do I want to let her know? I can't believe this. I thought I had things sorted out, not telling anyone anything. I really want to let her know though. I'm going to tell the truth.  
"你害怕什么？" 她问我。我有点像被人问"你在想什么？"时的感觉，但内心的一部分想要诚实地回答。我想让她知道吗？我无法相信这一点。我以为我已经把事情理清楚了，不向任何人透露任何事。但我真的很想让她知道。我要说实话。

"Does everything count? Eva, angels. All of them are terrifying. I guess it's people that scare me the most, though." I feel her head twitch, as if she just heard something unexpected. It doesn't seem like it would surprise her, it's not hard to tell that I'm terrible with people. I wait for her to say something, but in the end she doesn't end up speaking. I choose to continue.  
"一切都有意义吗？Eva，使徒。它们都令人恐惧。但我想，最让我害怕的还是人。" 我能感觉到她的头微微一动，仿佛听到了什么出乎意料的话。这似乎并不该让她惊讶，不难看出我在人际交往方面有多糟糕。我等待她开口，但最终她还是沉默了。我决定继续说下去。

"My father, obviously. I don't know why he's so cold to me, it's not like I ever did anything to him. Sometimes I feel like I hate him." I start to realize that I'm trembling as well. How stupid this must seem, two fourteen year olds shaking together in a bed in the middle of the night.  
"显然是我父亲。我不明白他为何对我如此冷漠，我从未做过任何对不起他的事。有时我甚至觉得我恨他。" 我开始意识到自己也在颤抖。两个十四岁的孩子在深夜的床上一起发抖，这看起来多么愚蠢。

"Maybe he's just afraid." Asuka adds. "Maybe he doesn't know how to act around you, so he just acts cold. The only person he comes even close to liking is _wonder girl_ anyway." sounding frustrated. "I don't know what's so special about her, especially when he's so distant to his own son." She pauses. "Maybe he's more scared of you, then you are of him."  
"或许他只是害怕。" 明日香补充道。"也许他不知道如何与你相处，所以才表现得如此冷漠。他唯一稍微喜欢的人就是那个奇迹女孩。" 她的声音带着沮丧。"我不明白她有什么特别的，尤其是他对亲生儿子都那么疏远。" 她停顿了一下。"也许他对你感到的恐惧，比你对他还要深。"

I laugh. "That's impossible. Even if he was scarred, I'm sure I'm more scarred." Maybe I should have considered her advice more, at least verbally. "It's not just him." I add. "It's all people. Misato, and Rei and-" I stop myself before I can say her name.  
我笑了。“那不可能。即使他受了伤，我敢肯定我受的伤更多。”或许我本应该更认真地考虑她的建议，至少口头上如此。“不只是他。”我补充道，“是所有人。美里，还有绫波和——”我及时打住，没说出她的名字。

"You mean me, right?" Asuka says, finishing my sentence. I can't help but stutter, "Um, well, not really that I'm scarred, but-"  
“你是指我，对吧？”明日香接过我的话。我忍不住结巴起来，“呃，嗯，并不是说我受了伤，但是——”

Interrupting me, I feel her hand reach for my arm. She grabs hold of it and pulls it closer to her body. She moves her hand down from my wrist to gently grasp my hand with her own, both of which are still trembling. "It's okay if you're afraid. We all have fears. I guess I'm not as nice as I could be to you anyway, so it makes sense." I tremble some more, but try to keep it down to a reasonable level.  
她打断我，我感觉到她的手伸向我的手臂。她紧紧抓住它，将其拉近她的身体。她的手从我的手腕滑下，温柔地用自己的手握住我的手，两只手都在微微颤抖。“如果你害怕也没关系。我们都有恐惧。我想我对你可能并不像我应该的那样好，所以这很正常。”我颤抖得更厉害了，但尽量控制在合理的范围内。

"You're such a fragile thing." Asuka tells me, as she strokes the back of my hand gently with her thumb. "Even just touching a person terrifies you, doesn't it?" I don't respond, nor do I know how to respond. "But who knows, maybe that's a good thing." She continues. "Maybe then when you find a person you're not afraid of, it will be that much more special."  
"你真是脆弱得不堪一击。" 明日香对我说，同时用她的拇指轻轻抚摸我的手背。"就连触碰别人都让你害怕，不是吗？" 我没有回应，也不知道该如何回应。"但谁知道呢，或许这是件好事。" 她继续说道，"也许当你找到一个不让你害怕的人时，那将会显得更加特别。"

Silence grips us for another moment. I feel her hand in my own, how soft she is, how tiny she is. She's like a goddess, I think. A goddess that calls me an idiot all the time.  
沉默再次笼罩了我们。我能感觉到她的手在我手中，她是如此柔软，如此娇小。我觉得她就像一位女神，一位总是叫我傻瓜的女神。

I hear her giggle. "Your hands all sweaty." Great, now I'm embarrassed myself. "Um, I'm sorry. I'll stop." I begin to pull my hand away, but she doesn't let go. "It's fine. It's kinda cute actually. You being so fragile makes me feel like I want to keep you safe." I blush, luckily she can't see my face. I feel her hand clench slightly, perhaps she was feeling awkward about what she said.  
我听到她咯咯笑了起来。"你的手都出汗了。" 糟糕，我自己也感到尴尬了。"嗯，对不起。我停下。" 我开始抽回我的手，但她没有放手。"没关系。其实还挺可爱的。你这么脆弱，让我觉得想要保护你。" 我脸红了，幸好她看不见我的脸。我感觉她的手稍微握紧了一些，也许她对自己说的话感到尴尬。

"I'm sorry, that was weird." She states. I give an awkward sounding retaliation "No, it's okay Asuka. If it's what you meant, then please don't feel bad about saying it, I guess." Her hand relaxes. It makes me feel like I did something good for a change.  
"对不起，刚才有点奇怪。" 她坦白道。我尴尬地回应："不，没事的，明日香。如果你是真心的，那就别为此感到难过，我想。" 她的手放松了。这让我感觉自己总算做了件好事。

"I know I won't protect you though. All I ever care about is myself. Even if I want to, I'll always just do what's best for _me"_ She must hate herself being so mean all the time, I guess. I mean, who wouldn't? Sure, every put down she's given herself has unfortunately been true, but at least she recognizes it. I guess we're more alike than we ever thought. I decide to say something.  
"我知道我不会保护你。我所关心的永远只有自己。即使我想，我也只会做对我最有利的事。" 她一定很讨厌自己总是这么刻薄，我想。谁不会呢？确实，她对自己的每一句贬低都无可奈何地真实，但至少她意识到了。我想，我们比想象中更相似。我决定说点什么。

"If it bothers you, then you don't need to live for yourself alone. You could just, you know, change the things about yourself that you don't really like." I say, hoping my comment doesn't upset her.  
"如果这让你困扰，你不必只为自己而活。你可以试着改变那些你不太喜欢的自己的方面。" 我说，希望我的话不会让她不高兴。

She giggles again, but this time, sarcastically. "You make it sound easy. Helping myself is all I know how to do. It's all I can do. I learned a long time ago not to expect special treatment from anyone else, so I guess I never learned how to give it." I hear her sniffle, and her trembling resumes. After not long, I can hear her crying. Not hysterically, but defeated. The extent of her self hate must be deeper than I ever suspected.  
"她又咯咯地笑了，但这次带着讽刺。“你让它听起来很简单。帮助自己是我唯一知道怎么做的事。这是我唯一能做的。我很早以前就学会了不要期望从任何人那里得到特殊待遇，所以我猜我从未学会如何给予它。”我听到她抽泣，她的颤抖又开始了。不久后，我能听到她在哭。不是歇斯底里，而是被打败了。她对自己的厌恶程度一定比我之前怀疑的要深得多。”

"I can't believe I'm such a jerk to everyone." She says, the words somewhat broken as she tries to speak as she cries. "I say all this now, but I know that in the morning I'll just go back to the way I always am. That's always what happens." She lays there crying. I wish I was strong enough to turn over and embrace her, but I can't find the strength to seek it out. Giving up on holding her, I try to muster the strength to speak instead.  
"“我真不敢相信我对每个人都这么混蛋。”她说，话语有些断断续续，边哭边试图说话。“我现在这么说，但我知道早上我就会回到原来的样子。一直都是这样。”她躺在那里哭泣。我希望我有足够的勇气翻身拥抱她，但我找不到寻求它的力量。放弃拥抱她，我试图鼓起力量说话。”

"We're Eva pilots, Asuka. We could die tomorrow." I say. I hear her crying die down as I speak, "I realized that on day one. Sure I have a lot of anxiety about what's going to happen next, what's going to happen tomorrow. I think the only way we can live is if we don't worry about what's going to come next." I don't even really know where my words are coming from, but I like how they sound. "Maybe you wont care in the morning, but you care right now, don't you?"  
我们是 Eva 驾驶员，明日香。我们可能明天就会死去。”我说道。随着我说话，她的哭声渐渐平息，“从第一天起我就意识到了这一点。当然，我对接下来会发生什么，明天会发生什么感到非常焦虑。我认为我们唯一能活下去的方式就是不去担心接下来会发生什么。”我甚至不知道这些话从何而来，但我喜欢它们的声音。“也许你早上就不在乎了，但此刻你在乎，不是吗？”

She goes silent. Even her crying can't be heard. I wonder if I've comforted her, or just messed up like I always do. I probably just made her uncomfortable. After laying there for a long time, I try to pull my hand away as not to bother her any longer, but as I do, I feel her grasping tighter around my palm. Once I realize she doesn't want me to let go, I move my hand back to where it was, still sweaty and warm, at least the shaking has stopped though. We lay there, and eventually lose track of time. It could have been a minute, or the extent of the night. After some time passed the air dried out our hands and evaporated the sweat. My palm now felt cool, and Asuka's hand kept it from getting to cold. She was soft, and warm, and holding her hand made me feel like I'd actually been blessed with something in this life. I guess I felt lucky to have her. At some point in the night, a minute or hours, Asuka broke the silence with an array of words that terrified me, but also made me feel warm inside.  
她沉默了，连哭泣声都听不见。我不知道自己是安慰了她，还是像往常一样搞砸了。可能只是让她感到不适。躺了很久后，我试图抽回手，不想再打扰她，但当我这么做时，感觉到她紧紧抓住我的手掌。意识到她不想我放手，我又把手放回原位，虽然还是汗津津的，但至少不再颤抖了。我们就这样躺着，时间不知不觉流逝。可能是一分钟，也可能是整个夜晚。过了一会儿，空气干燥了我们的手，汗水也蒸发了。我的手掌感觉凉凉的，而明日香的手让它不至于太冷。她柔软而温暖，握着她的手让我觉得这辈子真的得到了某种恩赐。我想我感到幸运能拥有她。夜里的某个时刻，一分钟或几小时，明日香打破了沉默，说出了一串让我害怕却又内心温暖的话。

"Hey Shinji..." She paused, as I felt her tremble slightly. "Do... you wanna kiss again?"  
“嘿，真嗣……”她停顿了一下，我感觉到她微微颤抖。“你……还想再亲吻吗？”
