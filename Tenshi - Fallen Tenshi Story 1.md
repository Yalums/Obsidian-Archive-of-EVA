Fallen Tenshi : 堕落天使：  
Story 1 By: Tenshi 故事一 作者：天使  
A Neon Genesis Evangelion Love Story.  
一个《新世纪福音战士》的爱情故事。

What a horrible day for me, Asuka thought to herself as she kicked a small stone out of her way, as if it was some large obstacle and walked in the fading sunshine back to the Apartment. She sighed and looked around her at Tokyo 3 or at least... what was left of it. The buildings were quite tattered after Third Impact. Everything looked so dead. All the shops were down. The electricity was only on thanks to a few child computer geniuses' that knew how the rotating-turbines worked. With all the adults dead in Tokyo 3, killed by the Angels who were hoping Earth could start anew with the "innocent" children generation, things were harder for everyone. Everyone over the age of 21 was killed a year ago that lived in this God forsaken country. She glanced up at an old familiar looking building and stopped walking. That was where she had first stayed in Tokyo 3, right when she came to this godamned country. The hotel where she spent her first hellish night here. There was something about Japan that made it hard for Asuka to sleep, or breathe freely. Her father... Almost as if the father she never knew, whom her dead mother never even knew, was from Japan. Maybe he even had worked in that building. She shrugged all her feelings off and continued walking down to the complex. She knew Shinji would be waiting for her...  
真是个糟糕透顶的一天，惣流·明日香心想，她一脚踢开路上的小石子，仿佛那是巨大的障碍，然后迎着夕阳的余晖走回公寓。她叹了口气，环顾四周的第三新东京市，或者说，至少是它残存的部分。第三次冲击过后，建筑物破败不堪，一切都显得死气沉沉。所有店铺都已关闭，电力供应全靠几个懂涡轮机原理的电脑神童维持。由于东京三号的成年人都被希望地球能以“纯洁”的儿童一代重新开始的使徒杀害，生活变得更加艰难。一年前，这个被诅咒的国家里所有 21 岁以上的人都被杀害了。她抬头望向一栋熟悉的旧建筑，停下了脚步。那是她初到第三新东京市时住的地方，就在她来到这个该死的国家的时候。她在那里度过了第一个地狱般的夜晚。日本这个地方让明日香难以安眠，甚至难以自由呼吸。她的父亲……仿佛那个她从未谋面、连她已故的母亲也未曾知晓的父亲，就来自日本。 或许他甚至曾在那栋大楼工作过。她耸耸肩，抛开所有思绪，继续向综合大楼走去。她知道真嗣会在那里等她……

Shinji had already cooked dinner. He sat by the stove; his elbow on his knee and his chin propped on his wrist, stirring the curry lazily. He was grateful for all the supplies he had after Third Impact. He had enough to keep him and Asuka together until they were 55 or so, if they made it that long. Disease was spreading through the children of Japan like wildfire. Some compared it to the Black Death. Shinji knew it was the Lillums fate...not even the Human Race could be cleaned after the corruption of adults was gone. Many children were still looking for a new God...  
真嗣已经准备好了晚餐。他坐在炉子旁，手肘撑在膝盖上，手腕托着下巴，懒洋洋地搅拌着咖喱。他对第三次冲击后所拥有的物资心存感激。如果他们能活那么久，这些物资足够他和明日香维持到 55 岁左右。疾病在日本的孩子中如野火般蔓延。有人将其比作黑死病。真嗣知道这是使徒的命运……即使人类的腐败被清除，人类也无法得到净化。许多孩子仍在寻找新的神……

Red-hot pain seared through Shinji's skin, flashing white-hot pain crossed his arm and into his head. He let out a wail and moved his hand away from the hot curry. He had sleepily laid his wrist on the edge of the pan. He clenched his wrist as the skin turned pink, then bubbled to a bright blood red. He cursed under his breath and slammed most of his arm into a bucket of room temperature water kept for emergencies. The burning ceased a bit but continued. He held his arm and looked at the burn through the water. His skin was distorted and bubbly, but he knew that would go away. Medicine was scarce so he decided this could wait. He would save the medicine for when it was needed more badly. He groaned and held his arm under the water for a few more seconds then pulled it out, and wrapped it in a nearby towel.  
滚烫的疼痛灼烧着真嗣的皮肤，一道炽热的痛感划过他的手臂直冲脑门。他发出一声哀嚎，急忙将手从热腾腾的咖喱上移开。他迷迷糊糊地将手腕搁在了锅边。随着皮肤由粉红转为鲜亮的血红色，他紧握着手腕，皮肤开始起泡。他低声咒骂着，将大半个手臂猛地浸入一桶常温水中，这是为紧急情况准备的。灼烧感稍有缓解，但并未完全消失。他举着手臂，透过水面观察烧伤处。皮肤扭曲起泡，但他知道这会消退。药品稀缺，他决定这伤可以等等再处理。他呻吟着，让手臂在水下多泡了几秒，然后抽出来，用旁边的毛巾包裹住。

He looked back at the curry pan and made a low moan. Asuka is going to be home soon and she is going to be hungry, and I spilled the godamned curry all over the floor. Great, now I am going to get yelled at. He looked down at his aching arm and took the towel off for easier movement. He started to clean the curry off the floor, saving what he could for the penguin.  
他回头望向咖喱锅，发出一声低沉的呻吟。明日香很快就要回家了，她会饿的，而我却把该死的咖喱洒了一地。这下好了，肯定要被她骂了。他低头看着疼痛的手臂，为了方便活动，把毛巾解开。他开始清理地板上的咖喱，尽可能地收集起来，留给企鹅吃。

He thought of how to apologize to her when the lights flickered. He looked at his watch and saw that it was 21:00. He knew the turbines were shutting down for the night and his chance to cook was over. Damn, he thought. He cursed more and took the bowl back to where Pen-pen lay. He waved it around Pen pen's head till it looked up at him.  
他思索着如何向她道歉，这时灯光闪烁起来。他看了看手表，发现已是晚上九点。他知道涡轮机即将关闭，今晚做饭的机会已经没了。该死，他想。他咒骂着，把碗拿回到躺在那里的 Pen-pen 旁边。他在 Pen-pen 的头顶挥动碗，直到它抬头看向他。

"Come on Pen pen, you need to eat. This is all I have for you today." Shinji pushed the bowl around to Pen-pen's front, so he could just dip his beak into it and eat. He petted his greying fur and sat down beside him, for the moment forgetting his burnt skin.  
来吧 Pen-pen，你得吃点东西。今天我只有这些给你了。" 碇真嗣把碗推到 Pen-pen 面前，让它可以轻松地用喙啄食。他轻抚着它那逐渐变灰的毛皮，坐在它旁边，暂时忘记了被烧伤的皮肤。

Asuka started up the stairs wearily. Her hand ached on the railing and she pulled herself up. She wondered how she had done this before...then she remembered. Before she didn't have to, before she could ride the elevator. She was so tired now. She had her job to go to everyday. All her schooling and early graduation from collage meant nothing now. No one cared about that now. All they cared about was having their own. One man for itself, Dog Eat Dog. She hated it. As much as she hated herself so many months before, she knew that this world was just as corrupt now as it was then, if not more so.  
明日香疲惫地开始爬楼梯。她的手在扶手上疼痛，她用力拉着自己向上。她纳闷以前是怎么做到的...然后她想起来了。以前她不需要这样，以前她可以乘电梯。现在她太累了。她每天都要去工作。她所有的学业和提前从大学毕业现在都毫无意义。现在没人关心这些了。他们只关心自己的利益，弱肉强食。她讨厌这样。就像她几个月前讨厌自己一样，她知道这个世界现在和那时一样腐败，甚至更甚。

Asuka breathed heavily after her journey from Floor 1 to Floor 7. She stopped to catch her breath and compose herself before she entered the apartment. She knew Shinji would be looking forward to seeing her this evening. She was the only source of joy he had. She knew this, and instead of shoving it in his face, she tendered him, and cared for him as much as she could. He softened her; they were so close now. They were all each other had. She couldn't even try to go back to Germany, and why would she want to? She knew that Shinji and her were family now, which was something she didn't have there. Something she didn't want to have there. She loved Shinji, though they never even shared a room, let alone had sex. She didn't mind as long as they were together. As long as his face lit up when he saw her. She would endure her painstaking job of running a bordello, which she never participated in, but she ran quite well. She was good with money. She smiled, suddenly very ready to face her evening with Shinji, yet tired enough to go right to bed. She slid her key into the door, and turned it. Her hand gripped the knob and she entered.  
从 1 楼到 7 楼的奔波让明日香气喘吁吁。她在进入公寓前停下脚步，深呼吸调整状态。她知道真嗣今晚一定在期待着见到她，因为她是他唯一的快乐源泉。她深知这一点，并没有以此炫耀，而是尽可能地温柔待他，关心他。他软化了她的心；如今他们如此亲密，彼此就是对方的一切。她甚至无法考虑回德国，又何必呢？她明白，她和真嗣现在是一家人，这是她在那里所没有的，也是她不想要的。她爱真嗣，尽管他们从未共处一室，更别提发生关系。只要他们能在一起，只要他看到她时脸上绽放笑容，她就不介意。她会忍受经营妓院这份辛苦的工作，虽然她从不参与其中，但她管理得相当出色。她善于理财。明日香微笑着，突然非常期待与真嗣共度的夜晚，却又疲惫得想直接上床休息。她将钥匙插入锁孔，转动，握住门把手，推门而入。

She closed the door behind her and expected to see Shinji at the table with some food or at least a soda, reading, but he was no where. She took off her shoes and looked around. At the stove was a spilled bowl of brown curry, half-cleaned up and half-still all over the floor. She walked around it and thought of calling his name, but was way too afraid to not get an answer and didn't say anything. She stepped over the bowl and looked at the emergency water, which seemed to be a bit cloudy. She bent down and pushed her fingers into the water, feeling the water warmer than the rest of the room. She shrugged and thought nothing of it. A towel was by the counter and she picked it up to wipe her hands. She walked around to the back room and saw Shinji's back. He was slumped over as though he were sleeping. She coughed a bit, and got no response.  
她关上身后的门，期待着看到真嗣坐在桌边，要么吃着东西，要么至少喝着汽水，正在阅读，但他却不见踪影。她脱下鞋子，四处张望。炉子上有一碗洒出的棕色咖喱，一半已经清理，一半还散落在地板上。她绕过它，本想呼唤他的名字，却因太过害怕得不到回应而没有出声。她跨过那碗咖喱，看向应急用水，水似乎有些浑浊。她弯下腰，将手指伸进水中，感觉到水温比房间其他地方要暖。她耸了耸肩，并未多想。柜台旁有一条毛巾，她拿起它擦了擦手。她绕到后面的房间，看到了真嗣的背影。他俯身趴着，仿佛睡着了一般。她轻咳一声，却没有得到任何回应。

"Shinji? What are you doing?" She made her voice kind of sharp, though it hurt her to potentially hurt him. There was no way she would let him see that though. She crossed her arms in front of her yellow sundress and cocked her head. He turned around, and looked at her.  
“真嗣？你在做什么？”她让自己的声音听起来有些尖锐，尽管这可能会伤害到他，但她内心感到痛苦。不过，她绝不会让他看出这一点。她交叉双臂在黄色太阳裙前，歪着头。他转过身来，目光投向了她。

"Asuka. Welcome home. I was...uh.. Feeding Pen-pen with what is left of our dinner..." He turned around.  
"明日香，欢迎回家。我刚才在...呃...用我们剩下的晚餐喂企鹅..." 他转过身来。

She stepped around him and sat by him. "What happened to dinner?" She looked not at him, but at the eating bird, barely strong enough to move its head to the food.  
"她绕过他，坐到他旁边。"晚餐怎么了？" 她没有看他，而是看着那只勉强能动头去吃食的鸟。

He didn't answer her. Instead, he reached out a hand to stroke Pen-pen again. "He doesn't want to move, ever. I was thinking maybe we should put him out of his misery. His little penguin heart is dead... Died when Misato..." He stroked his short feathers.  
"他没有回答她。相反，他伸出手再次抚摸企鹅。"它不想动了，永远不想。我在想或许我们应该让它解脱。它那颗小企鹅的心已经死了...在美里...那时候就死了。" 他轻抚着它短短的羽毛。

Asuka made a face, and then crossed her arms again. "Shinji...how long have you been thinking about this?" She looked at his face, his complexion nice but pale and his nose and cheeks firm, she noticed since she kissed him the first time to kill her boredom that he was handsome.  
明日香做了个鬼脸，然后再次交叉双臂。“真嗣……你考虑这件事多久了？”她看着他的脸，肤色不错但略显苍白，鼻梁和脸颊线条分明，自从第一次为了打发无聊而吻他时，她就注意到他很帅气。

"Since...well since he started acting like this." He looked up at her, saw her looking at him, and they both looked down blushing.  
“自从……嗯，自从他开始这样表现。”他抬头看向她，发现她也在看他，两人都脸红着低下头。

"Well..." she stood up and dusted her backside. "If you think that is the best for him, we can look into it I guess. But for now, Shinji, I want something to drink."  
“嗯……”她站起身，拍了拍屁股上的尘土。“如果你认为这对他最好，我们可以考虑一下。但现在，真嗣，我想喝点东西。”

She turned and walked out of the room. Shinji looked down at the bird struggling to eat, and left the plate of food there for him to finish. Still looking down at him as he stood up and started to walk out, he bumped into Asuka's back. She lurched forward, and hit her head on the refrigerator. Shinji fell back a bit, then regained his balance and walked swiftly to her, touching her back. She lost it and pumped her hand back to hit his face. Their skin made contact and Shinji's face went to the side. She had not hit him hard enough to hurt, but it was the principle that she had slapped him.  
她转身走出了房间。真嗣低头看着那只挣扎着进食的小鸟，将盘子留在那里让他吃完。当他站起来开始往外走时，仍然低头看着小鸟，结果撞到了明日香的背上。她向前一倾，头撞到了冰箱上。真嗣往后退了一点，然后恢复平衡，快步走向她，轻触她的背。她失控了，猛地向后挥手打向他的脸。他们的皮肤接触了，真嗣的脸偏向一边。她并没有用力到足以伤害他，但原则是她已经给了他一巴掌。

She turned and looked at him, not really mad, more sorry she had hit him. She touched his his hand covering his face. "Shinji, sorry. You know with my kind of work. I have to-"  
她转过身来看着他，并不是真的生气，更多的是因为打了他而感到抱歉。她触摸着他捂着脸的手。“真嗣，对不起。你知道我的工作性质，我必须……”

"Oh I know!" Shinji smiled and took his hand down, letting her hand fall and she kept it close to her side. Something passed between then and they both blushed. Asuka turned to the refrigerator again, and pretended to look in. What is all the tension between us today? He acts as though he is afraid of me, she thought to herself, and quickly pulled a beer out.  
“哦，我知道！”真嗣微笑着放下手，让她手落下，她则将手紧贴在身侧。某种情感在他们之间流转，两人都脸红了。明日香再次转向冰箱，假装在里面寻找东西。我们之间今天怎么这么紧张？他表现得好像很怕我，她心里想着，迅速拿出一瓶啤酒。

"Shinji, you want one? Nothing like a cold Yebisu to calm ya!" She smiled widely, opened the tab can and gulped down the bitter golden fluid. She swallowed, wiped her face and looked at him. She smiled wider when she saw that he wasn't really all there. She waved her hand in front of his face, till his blue eyes turned slowly to look at her. She reached back and got him a beer without taking her gaze away from his. Her smile faded, and he looked at her with what she would later recall as longing, and she blushed. She handed him the can, and looked away, taking a sip of her own.  
"真嗣，你要来一罐吗？没有什么比冰镇的惠比寿更能让人冷静下来了！" 她笑得十分灿烂，打开易拉罐，大口喝下那苦涩的金色液体。她咽下后，擦了擦脸，然后看向他。当她发现他似乎心不在焉时，她的笑容更甚。她在他面前挥了挥手，直到他那双蓝色的眼睛缓缓转向她。她伸手又给他拿了一罐啤酒，目光始终未从他身上移开。她的笑容逐渐消失，而他则用一种她后来回忆起来充满渴望的眼神看着她，让她不禁脸红。她递给他那罐啤酒，然后转过头去，抿了一口自己的。

He took the can and popped it, taking a small sip. He turned around and sat at the table. She watched him and took several more gulps of her beer before crushing the can in her strong hands. She looked at him as she reached in refrigerator for another beer. The silence was odd for her; she wondered what he was thinking about.  
他接过啤酒，打开后轻啜一口。他转过身，坐在桌旁。她注视着他，又连喝了几大口啤酒，随后用她有力的双手将空罐捏扁。她一边看着他，一边伸手从冰箱里又拿了一罐啤酒。这种沉默对她来说很奇怪；她好奇他此刻在想些什么。

Shinji looked up out the open window. Still looking at the beer, He asked Asuka for another beer, and took it without ever moving his eyes. He couldn't bear to look at her. He couldn't bear to look at her shapely body, the curves of her hips, her round breasts jutting out of her dress like rocks. When he was sure she wasn't looking, he moved his eyes down and over to look at her nipples, sticking out and hard from her sudden chill. Shinji blushed and moved his legs so even if she looked for it, she wouldn't be able to see the erection growing in his pants. He blushed harder and he realized she was talking. "...And so I told him, 'Listen you asshole, I don't do that kind of thing here, I only charge the money!' and I hit him square in the nose. I had a roundabout with the boss, but I didn't get fired. I am too cute to get fired." She took a swig of her beer, and Shinji noticed that her nipples weren't visible anymore. He sipped his beer without saying anything. Suddenly Asuka's face was sullen and she sat by Shinji, plopping down in the chair then sliding forward. He watched, unsure if she would catch herself or fall on the floor. He moved his slender body closer, ready to catch her if she fell. She sat there after finishing her third beer and slumped, then caught herself and stared at Shinji, propping her elbow on the table and pushing her head up with her palm. This caused one of her eyes to be partially closed and Shinji realized she was drunk.  
真嗣抬头望向敞开的窗外，目光依旧停留在啤酒上，他向明日香再要了一瓶啤酒，接过时眼睛始终未曾移开。他无法忍受直视她，无法忍受凝视她那曼妙的身躯、臀部曲线以及圆润的胸部，它们宛如岩石般从裙装中挺立而出。确认明日香没有注意时，他偷偷将视线移至她因突如其来的寒意而坚挺凸起的乳尖。真嗣脸颊泛红，调整双腿位置，以防她察觉到自己裤子里逐渐勃起的欲望。他愈发羞赧，意识到明日香正在说话：“……于是我告诉他，‘听着，混蛋，我在这儿不做那种事，我只收钱！’然后我一拳正中他鼻子。虽然跟老板闹了点别扭，但没被炒鱿鱼。我太可爱了，不会被解雇的。”她灌下一口啤酒，真嗣注意到她的乳尖已不再显露。他默默啜饮着自己的啤酒。突然间，明日香面露忧郁，坐到真嗣旁边，重重地落座后向前滑移。他注视着，不确定她是否会稳住自己或跌落地面。 他挪动纤细的身体靠近，准备在她跌倒时扶住她。她喝完第三瓶啤酒后坐在那里，身体一歪，随即又稳住自己，盯着真嗣，将手肘撑在桌上，用手掌托着头。这使得她的一只眼睛半闭着，真嗣意识到她已经醉了。

"Asuka...when was the last time you had anything to eat?" He frowned and drank the rest of his beer, crushing it in his hand and setting it, crumpled on the tabletop.  
"明日香……你上次吃东西是什么时候？" 他皱起眉头，喝完了自己的啤酒，用力捏扁罐子，放在桌上。

She shrugged drunkenly. She thought about it, her mind blurry of the day's events. "Erm...I guess not since last night, I guess." She shook her head and tried to collect her thoughts. She looked at him and he was nodding. She saw him through her muddy eyes and blurred vision and smiled. She lifted her hand and reached out to touch him. Shinji instantly froze up and tried not to look at Asuka. She is drunk, she doesn't know what she is doing, Shinji thought as Asuka trailed a slender finger from his temple to his cheek, and then rubbed her thumb on his skin. The smile dropped off of her face as she took his face in her hand and made him look at her. Their eyes met and they glistened, reflecting each other's face back at them. Both could do nothing but stare at the ice blue eyes before them. Asuka was the first to look away, as if she had lost a staring match, but this was different. She finally saw in Shinji's eyes what everyone else saw when they saw him staring at her. There was so much passion in his eyes that drifted out when he gazed upon her, so much love that had built up since the first time he met her.  
她醉醺醺地耸了耸肩，思绪因白日的事件而模糊不清。“呃……我想，应该是从昨晚开始吧。”她摇摇头，试图整理思绪。她望向他，见他点头，透过朦胧的双眼和模糊的视线，她微笑了。她抬起手，伸向他的脸庞。真嗣立刻僵住，尽力不去看明日香。她醉了，不知道自己在做什么，真嗣心想，而明日香则用纤细的手指从他的太阳穴滑至脸颊，再用拇指轻抚他的肌肤。当她用手捧住他的脸，让他直视自己时，笑容从她脸上消失。他们的目光交汇，眼中闪烁着彼此的倒影。两人只能凝视着对方那冰蓝色的眼眸。明日香率先移开视线，仿佛输掉了对视比赛，但这次不同。她终于在真嗣眼中看到了其他人看到他凝视她时所见的一切——那满溢的激情，当他凝望她时流露出来；那积聚已久的爱意，自初次相遇便已萌生。

Asuka stared at him for a second after she saw it, then she turned her head, a small tear already trailing down her cheek. She scolded herself, If this had been before, I would have slapped him for looking at me like that. I would reach right out and knocked him off that chair. But now... I want to look back at him, I want to look back at him like he looks at me, I love him. I love Shinji Ikari! She gasped and wrapped her arms around her stomach. Another small tear worked its way past the curves of her face, and dropped on her bare knee that was peaking out of her dress. Shinji's own eyes caught the light reflecting off her tear and he stared at her knee as if it was the softest flower he could ever want to touch. His face turned to hers, and he saw pain in her eyes. I did this to her? I was... I was looking at her with longing she could finally see. Shinji didn't know whether to be happy that she saw it, or sad that he could have possibly messed up their whole balance of family. She sighed at the same time that she groaned painfully. He looked up at her again, seeing the light bounce off of her shiny hair and her toned shoulders. He was trying to hide his slight erection again when she doubled over and fell off of her chair. Her body hit the floor with a thud and Shinji's eyes widened, and then his body sprang into action.  
明日香看到后愣了一秒，随即转过头去，脸颊上已滑下一滴小小的泪珠。她在心里责备自己，若换作以前，我定会因为他那样看我而给他一巴掌。我会直接出手把他从椅子上打下来。但现在...我想回望他，我想像他看我那样回望他，我爱他。我爱碇真嗣！她倒吸一口气，双手环抱住腹部。又一颗小小的泪珠顺着脸颊的弧度滑落，滴在她从裙摆下露出的光裸膝盖上。真嗣的目光捕捉到那滴泪反射的光芒，他凝视着她的膝盖，仿佛那是他渴望触碰的最柔软的花朵。他的脸转向她，看到了她眼中的痛苦。是我让她如此吗？我...我终于让她看到了我眼中的渴望。真嗣不知该为她能看见而高兴，还是该为可能破坏了他们家庭原有的平衡而难过。她同时叹息和痛苦地呻吟。他再次抬头望向她，只见光线在她闪亮的秀发和紧实的肩头跳跃。 当她突然弯腰从椅子上摔下来时，他正试图再次掩饰自己的轻微勃起。她的身体砰的一声撞到地板上，真嗣的眼睛瞪大了，随即他的身体迅速做出反应。

Asuka shivered and shuddered with the pain coming to her from her abdomen. She let out a few German swears as she felt herself fall. She couldn't even stop herself from falling off the chair. This is what I get for not eating anything, then drinking alcohol. I am such a fool, her mind cried out to Shinji, This isn't you. I want so badly to tell you, I want so badly to gaze at you the way you gazed at me. My own stupidity has gotten in the way of this. Love. She felt her mind began to fail and it seemed all the colours of the room blended to make one awful one. She let her eyes close and then opened them again when she realized Shinji was beside her. She couldn't move! She wanted to reach out her fingers and touch his face, all she could do was cringe at pain shooting out of her, and bouncing back off the inside of her skin. She was exploding, and trying to stay for her love. Am I dying? Her eyes threatened to close again. Shinji touched her face. She could feel him touch her face, his slender fingers rubbing her skin, then coming to his lips with tears on them. Another one of his hands rested on her hip. Am I dying? She saw Shinji's lips, wet with her tears, his fingers still so close to his trembling lips, unsure of what was happening to her. There was no one to call. No one to care for her now. Only him. Only her love. His lips were moving, and she squinted against the pain to see what they were saying. They were saying the same things to her over and over. Shinji was saying something to her and she was unable to hear it! Or was he letting his frail voice escape those lips at all? Was he only mouthing the words he couldn't say to her under other circumstances? Asuka fluttered her eyes, struggling to view his words. Maybe he is saying something to me only because I am dying. Something I can't pound him for tomorrow. Am I dying? Her eyes opened widely as another sharp pain filled her body, and she saw his lips mouth the words, slowly as he was talking to a foreigner: Ai Shiteru Asuka.  
明日香因腹部传来的疼痛而颤抖，她感到自己正在跌落，不禁用德语咒骂了几句。她甚至无法阻止自己从椅子上摔下来。这就是我不吃东西就喝酒的下场，我真是个傻瓜，她的心声向真嗣呼喊，这不是你。我多么渴望告诉你，多么渴望以你凝视我的方式凝视你。我的愚蠢阻碍了这一切。爱情。她感到意识开始模糊，房间里所有的颜色似乎都融合成了一种可怕的色调。她闭上眼睛，当意识到真嗣就在身边时又睁开了。她动弹不得！她想要伸出手指触摸他的脸庞，却只能因剧痛而蜷缩，疼痛从体内迸发，又反弹回皮肤之内。她感觉自己像是在爆炸，却仍努力为爱停留。我是在死去吗？她的眼皮再次沉重。真嗣触摸了她的脸颊，她能感受到他纤细的手指摩挲着她的肌肤，然后带着泪水移至唇边。他的另一只手轻轻放在她的腰际。我是在死去吗？ 她看见真嗣的唇，沾着她的泪水，手指依旧紧贴着颤抖的唇边，对她的遭遇感到迷茫。无人可呼唤，无人再关心她。唯有他，唯有她的爱。他的唇在动，她忍痛眯眼，试图看清他在说什么。那些话一遍遍重复着。真嗣在对她说些什么，她却听不见！还是他根本就没让那微弱的声音从唇间逸出？他只是在无声地重复那些在其他情况下无法对她言说的话吗？明日香眨着眼，努力想看清他的话语。或许他只因我濒死才对我说些什么，那些明天我无法为此责怪他的话。我快死了吗？当另一阵剧痛袭来，她的眼睛猛地睁大，看见他的唇缓缓吐出，仿佛在对一个异国人说话：我爱你，明日香。

Asuka's eyes closed and her body slumped. Shinji moved back and sat on his heals, looking at her in her crumpled position. She was unconscious, but he knew Asuka was only suffering from small alcohol poisoning. It didn't matter anyway, to anyone other than him. She could die right there on the floor and no one would care but Shinji... He would have to bury her in the park cemetery probably, and no one but him would do it. He sighed at the current situation and then he touched her cheek again. Her skin was silk on his rough fingers and he felt his already existing erection spring forth again. He blushed, his blood rushing under the skin on his face, and he looked away from her. He saw that she loved him right before she passed out. He could see it in her eyes, but was it really her? Shinji sighed and realized it was only the alcohol talking, most likely. He sighed and sat forward on his knees. He brought his hands to her side and pushed her gently to her side, one hand under her head as a small baby would need cradled, kept from falling and breaking off. He shivered and brushed her hair back, pushing it behind her ears. She was so pale, her skin an unnatural ivory colour. Her body was warm against his arms as he used all of the strength in him to lift her, sliding one hand around her back and the other under her legs. She felt like a small empty rag doll in his arms, so lifeless and tender. His face was only slightly strained at the weight of her body. They had to eat less and she lost what fat she ever had. He had to work more and his arms and muscles were built since before the Impact. He took in painless breaths as he used his foot to slide the rice paper wall aside, and enter her room.  
明日香的眼睛闭上了，身体瘫软下来。真嗣后退几步，跪坐下来，凝视着她蜷缩的姿态。她失去了意识，但他知道明日香只是轻微酒精中毒。无论如何，除了他，这对其他人来说都无关紧要。她可以就这样死在地板上，除了真嗣，没人会在乎...他可能得在公园墓地将她埋葬，而这事也只有他会去做。他叹了口气，对当前的状况感到无奈，然后再次触碰她的脸颊。她的肌肤如丝绸般滑过他粗糙的手指，他感到自己本已存在的勃起再次涌现。他脸红起来，血液在面部皮肤下涌动，他移开视线，不敢再看她。就在她昏迷前，他看到了她对他的爱。他能在她的眼中看到，但那真的是她吗？真嗣叹了口气，意识到这多半只是酒精的作用。他再次叹息，向前倾身跪坐，双手轻推她的侧身，一手托住她的头，就像小心翼翼地抱住一个婴儿，防止她跌落受伤。他颤抖着，将她的头发拨到耳后。她如此苍白，肌肤呈现出一种不自然的象牙色。 她的身体紧贴着他的臂弯，他用尽全力将她抱起，一手环住她的背，另一手托住她的腿。她在他怀里宛如一只轻盈无力的布偶，毫无生气却柔弱至极。他因她的体重而略显吃力，但面容依旧平静。他们不得不减少食量，她失去了仅有的脂肪。而他，自大灾难前便开始辛勤劳作，臂膀与肌肉愈发强健。他深吸一口气，不带痛楚，用脚轻轻推开纸门，步入她的房间。

He looked around for a bed, and was captivated by how neat everything was in her sanctuary. It looked to him as though everything was put away neatly and out of sight, then he realized that she had nothing. She had sold everything at market to help him get the first couple months rent to the 20-year-old landlord. He looked at her bed, neatly made and low, and he stepped over some crumpled papers to lay her gently on her bed. She fell out of his arms and landed on the bed in an angelic way, as though she floated there. Shinji pushed her over a few inches to make room for him to sit. He didn't bother closing the door. Light from the moon filtered in above them and the room seemed to be glowing a soft blue colour. He looked for a second out at the moon, looking foolishly for the great Lance lost a year ago in the fight against the Angels. He smiled to himself and looked down at her floor, the stained carpet from when the roof leaked in rain. He knew that the Lance was gone, and too small to see from Earth with the naked human eye. He sighed and the smile disappeared from his face. He turned around at the sound of Asuka breathing harder. He turned around so he was facing her and he reached his slender fingers down to touch her silky skin once again, moving her hair out of her face. Shinji sighed and moved the other hand closer, unclipping her hair clips and sliding them down, letting her hair fall freely around her shoulders. He clutched the clips for a second then placed them on the stand beside her bed. He turned his head quickly again when Asuka moaned. Shinji found her looking at him, her eyes puffy as if she had been crying. Or in very much pain. Suddenly, Asuka reached behind her bed and pulled out a small grey trashcan, and she lifted her face over the bed and buried it in the the can, heaving dry air and clear fluid. Shinji reached over and pulled her hair back away from her face, holding it back and patting her forehead with the cool back of his hand.  
他环顾四周寻找床铺，被她圣所中一切的整洁所吸引。在他看来，所有物品都整齐地收好，不见踪影，随后他意识到她一无所有。为了帮他支付给那位 20 岁房东前几个月的租金，她已在市场上卖掉了所有东西。他望向她那铺得整齐而低矮的床，跨过几张皱巴巴的纸张，轻柔地将她放在床上。她从他怀中滑落，宛如天使般轻盈地落在床上。真嗣轻轻推她挪动几寸，为自己腾出坐下的空间。他并未费心关门，月光透过上方洒入，房间仿佛笼罩在柔和的蓝色光晕中。他向外瞥了一眼月亮，愚蠢地寻找一年前在与使徒战斗中遗失的那把伟大长枪。他自嘲地笑了笑，低头看向她那因屋顶漏雨而染色的地毯。他知道那把长枪已不复存在，且太小，肉眼无法从地球上看见。他叹了口气，笑容从脸上消失。他转过身，听到明日香呼吸变得急促。 他转过身来面对着她，修长的手指再次轻触她丝滑的肌肤，将她的发丝从脸庞拨开。真嗣叹了口气，另一只手靠近，解开她的发夹，任其滑落，让她的秀发自由地披散在肩上。他紧握了一会儿发夹，然后将其放在她床边的架子上。当明日香轻声呻吟时，他迅速再次转头。真嗣发现她正凝视着他，双眼红肿，仿佛刚刚哭过，或是正承受着极大的痛苦。突然，明日香伸手到床后，拽出一个灰色的小垃圾桶，她将脸凑近床边，埋头于桶中，干呕着，伴随着清澈的液体。真嗣伸手将她的头发从脸旁拨开，用手背轻抚她的额头，带来一丝凉意。

Asuka felt a sick pain from her stomach, but when she lifted her face out of the trashcan, her stomach felt better, yet still tight and threatened to heave again. She was pale, and she was sweating, making the hair framing her face wet and sticky. When she raised her face, she didn't look at Shinji. How could she, she had just passed out and threw up. She was humiliated. She felt herself blushing in the darkness when she realized he hadn't moved his hands away from her, he was still clutching her hair, and patting her skin with his hand, although it was no longer cool. He said nothing, and she also kept her silence. Shinji was content with this, but Asuka was screaming inside to kiss him. She shook her head slightly, not enough for him to notice. Not only can't I kiss him now because I am a wimp, but because I just puked everything I had out. I'll say something to him... uh. I will say. I want a drink of water! That's it! She lifted her face and looked at him, shrugging away his hands. His heart leapt when her eyes looked at his and she opened her lips. "Shinji... Will you get me a drink of water?" She looked down again. Shinji died just a little inside, but then realized she was still sick and not ready to talk about earlier. He stood and went into the kitchen.  
明日香感到胃里一阵剧痛，但当她从垃圾桶中抬起脸时，胃部虽有所缓解，却依旧紧绷，仿佛随时会再次呕吐。她面色苍白，汗水淋漓，额前的发丝湿漉漉地贴在脸上。抬头时，她并未看向真嗣。她怎能面对他，刚刚才昏厥并呕吐。羞辱感涌上心头。意识到真嗣的手仍未从她身上移开，依旧紧握着她的头发，轻拍着她的肌肤，尽管已不再冰凉，她在黑暗中不禁脸红。两人都沉默不语，真嗣对此感到满足，而明日香内心却在呐喊着想要吻他。她微微摇头，不让真嗣察觉。此刻不仅因懦弱无法吻他，更因刚吐得一干二净。她要对他开口...呃，她会说的。她想要喝水！就这么办！她抬起头，目光与他对视，轻轻摆脱他的手。当她的眼神触及他的，嘴唇微启时，他的心跳加速。"真嗣...能给我拿杯水吗？"她再次垂下眼帘。 真嗣内心微微一沉，但随即意识到她还在生病，尚未准备好谈论之前的事情。他站起身，走进了厨房。

Asuka looked at her floor and noticed the crumpled paper by the doorway. Her eyes widened and her mind was suspicious instantly. She stood up, slowly as not to upset anything in her delicate nature right now. She glanced at the kitchen to see if Shinji was still there, and picked the papers up and stuffed them under her pillow without even looking at them. She sat back on her bed and slumped. She brushed her hair with her fingers and was looking for a comb when Shinji came back into the room. She saw his silhouette against the brighter gas lamp light from the kitchen and main room, and he slid the door closed behind him. Shinji shuffled over to the bed in his slippers, and handed the glass of warm water to Asuka. She took it and nodded, looking at it then bringing it to her lips gratefully.  
明日香看着地板，注意到门口那张皱巴巴的纸。她的眼睛瞪大了，立刻心生疑窦。她小心翼翼地站起来，以免破坏自己此刻脆弱的状态。她瞥了一眼厨房，确认真嗣是否还在那里，然后捡起纸张，看都没看就塞到了枕头下。她重新坐回床上，颓然垂下肩膀。她用手指梳理着头发，正寻找梳子时，真嗣回到了房间。她看到他的身影映衬在厨房和主厅更亮的煤气灯灯光下，他轻轻地关上了门。真嗣穿着拖鞋，拖着脚步走到床边，递给明日香一杯温水。她接过杯子，点了点头，先是看了看，然后感激地送到唇边。

Shinji looked at her waiting for her to say something. Everytime her breath made a noise his heart made another bound to her, and then he was always dropped off of his personal cliff when she took another drink and said nothing. Asuka was savoring the water, trying to drink it slow, though her throat was burning. She knew there would be no more for her tonight. There ration was running out and the river was too far to drive. She saw Shinji staring at her from the corner of her eye, and she sighed, then watched him take in a breath as though he thought she was going to say something. She closed her eyes and tipped the glass to make the water touch her parched lips.  
真嗣注视着她，期待她开口说些什么。每当她的呼吸发出声响，他的心跳便又向她靠近一分，而每当她再次举杯饮水却默不作声时，他便如坠深渊。明日香细细品味着水，试图慢慢饮用，尽管喉咙灼热难耐。她清楚今晚不会再有水了，配给即将耗尽，而河流又远得无法驱车前往。她用余光察觉到真嗣的凝视，轻叹一声，见他屏息以待，仿佛以为她即将开口。她闭上双眼，倾斜杯子，让水轻触干裂的唇瓣。

Shinji whiped his hands on his pants, thinking that she didn't see him staring at her. His hands were sweating; he wanted so badly to touch her face like he did when she was unconscious, and tell her that he loved her again. He looked down, taking his eyes off of her for the moment, and looking at his hands. Asuka noticed his face was down and she looked upward at him, turning her face so she was facing him. Shinji did not notice that the beautiful auburn haired goddess of love was looking at him, as he had been waiting for her to do since he gave her the glass of water. Asuka cocked her head at his profile, the way that his nose curved up slightly at the end and how his bangs fell just over his eyes was making her stomach turn, and her nipples started to burn as they hardened. Shinji looked at her stained carpet, suddenly afraid of heartbreak to look back up at her again, though he was still unaware that she was looking at him now with his matched longing. She closed her eyes at the same time he did, then Shinji turned his head up to look at her again, his eyes closed in that split second. His fingers itched and burned. He opened his eyes as she did, and the two found themselves looking at each other's blue eyes, the same as earlier that evening, only this time, there was no questioning.  
真嗣在裤子上擦了擦手，心想她没看到他盯着她。他的手心在出汗；他如此渴望像她昏迷时那样触摸她的脸，再次告诉她他爱她。他低下头，暂时将目光从她身上移开，看向自己的双手。明日香注意到他的脸低垂着，便抬头看向他，转过脸来面对他。真嗣并未察觉那位美丽的红发爱神正注视着他，自从他递给她那杯水后，他一直在等待这一刻。明日香侧头打量着他的侧脸，他鼻尖微微上翘的弧度，以及刘海恰好遮住眼睛的样子，让她的胃里一阵翻腾，乳头也开始因紧绷而发烫。真嗣看着她那块染色的地毯，突然害怕心碎而不敢再抬头看她，尽管他仍未意识到此刻她正以与他相匹配的渴望凝视着他。两人同时闭上了眼睛，随后真嗣再次抬头望向她，就在那一瞬间，他的眼睛也闭上了。他的手指痒得发烫。 他睁开眼睛，与她同时，两人再次凝视着彼此的蓝眸，如同当晚早些时候一样，只是这一次，无需任何疑问。

Eyes of ice blue gazed into pools of blue blood. It seemed as though they were breaking through each other's minds, searching and swimming for the other's feelings. Asuka's hair was pushed back as Shinji let out his breath finally, not being able to hold it in anymore, and Asuka's grip on the water glass loosened, sending the glass down to her stained floor. Asuka threw her arms around Shinji's shoulders and his hands went to her waist without hesitaiton, so secure after finding each other's feelings. As the water glass tumbled and spilled it's last contents like a waterfall, Asuka's eyes welled and her tears feel over her cheeks. As the glass broke and shattered almost noiselessly on the floor, Shinji moved his face into the embrace and tilted his head, touching her lips with his own for the second time, shattering the emotional boundaries. Her lips were soft on his and her arms felt great around his shoulders. Asuka let her lips be touched with meaning and her tears fell down between them, so both could taste the saltiness that was her. She touched the hair at the top of his neck, and pushed his head to hers passionately, as his arms tightened around her waist, her body being crushed delicately against him. Her hair fell against Shinji's hands and he used one hand to run his hand through it to cradle her head.  
冰蓝色的眼眸凝视着深邃的蓝血之池，仿佛彼此的心灵正在穿透对方，探寻并游弋于彼此的情感深处。终于，真嗣无法再屏住呼吸，他呼出一口气，使得明日香的发丝随之飘扬。她手中的水杯因握力放松而坠落，砸在她那斑驳的地板上。明日香猛地张开双臂环抱住真嗣的肩头，而他的双手也毫不犹豫地搭上她的腰际，在寻得彼此情感后显得如此安心。随着水杯翻滚，最后一滴水如瀑布般倾泻而出，明日香的眼眶盈满泪水，顺着脸颊滑落。当玻璃杯在地板上几乎无声地碎裂时，真嗣将脸埋入她的怀抱，轻轻侧头，第二次触碰她的唇瓣，彻底打破了情感的界限。她的唇柔软地贴合着他的，她的双臂环绕在他的肩上感觉如此美好。明日香任由自己的唇被深情触碰，泪水滴落在两人之间，让他们共同品味那份属于她的咸涩。 她轻触他颈后的发丝，热情地将他的头推向自己，他的双臂紧紧环抱她的腰，她的身体被轻柔地压向他。她的发丝落在真嗣的手上，他用一只手穿过她的发丝，托住她的头。

Asuka pulled on his head with her hands, moving her face away. Her ice blue eyes darted from one of his eyes to the next, looking for her words in him, looking for him to tell her what to say. He looked at her, holding her in his arms while she probed him with her eyes. Shinji gladly let her go anywhere in him she wanted. She pushed her head beside his, their cheeks warm together. She swallowed, and Shinji did also, the sweat starting to pour out of his forehead in a light mist. He smelled her hair, and cradled her body against his, waiting for her to say something once again.  
明日香用手拉扯他的头，将脸移开。她冰蓝色的眼睛从他的一个眼睛跳到另一个，试图从他那里寻找话语，寻找他告诉她该说什么。他看着她，抱着她，而她用眼神探寻着他。真嗣欣然让她在他心中任意游走。她将头靠在他的旁边，两人的脸颊温暖地贴在一起。她咽了咽口水，真嗣也跟着咽了咽，汗水开始从他的额头轻轻渗出。他闻着她的发香，将她的身体紧贴自己，等待她再次开口。

She took in a breath, and then used it to propell her words. She moved her lips to his ear, and breathed out a bit of her breath, causing Shinji to shiver. Asuka pushed her lips to him, and whispered very quietly, as if there were other people that could hear the secret she was going to share with him. Shinji breathed in as well, not letting it out for fear of not hearing her small voice.  
她深吸一口气，用它来推动自己的话语。她将嘴唇凑到他的耳边，轻轻吐出一丝气息，让真嗣不由得颤抖。明日香将嘴唇贴近他，极其轻声地耳语，仿佛周围还有其他人能听见她即将与他分享的秘密。真嗣也屏住呼吸，不敢呼出，生怕错过她细小的声音。

"Anata wa Watashi ai, my Shinji. Take me, have me. I am yours."  
你是我的爱，我的真嗣。带我走，拥有我。我属于你。

Shinji held her close as though she could break as easily as the glass that glittered on the floor, and he nodded. A tear dripped down his cheek. He let out his breath and started to pick her up, heading to his bedroom.  
真嗣紧紧抱着她，仿佛她会像地上闪烁的玻璃一样易碎，他点了点头。一滴泪水滑过他的脸颊。他呼出气息，开始抱起她，朝自己的卧室走去。
