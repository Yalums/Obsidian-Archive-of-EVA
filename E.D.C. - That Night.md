Hi !  
  
I'm kinda new to all this, I've add an account of SV for 2 weeks or something, and more importantly I'm really new at the whole fanfiction thing. I've been reading Evangelion fanfictions for a while now, starting with Higher Learning back in the day.  
我对这一切还挺新手的，我在 SV 上注册账号才两周左右，更重要的是，我对整个同人小说领域也真的很陌生。我一直在阅读《新世纪福音战士》的同人小说，最初是从《高等教育》开始的。  
But it didn't end there ! I kept on reading more and more stories until one of them, _Look at Me_ by Effybelle, which brought me to write my own. You know, just to get it out of my system. So that's just what I did. Thing is, now I kinda want to keep going, to get it to the end, I have the ideas but I'm not that sure about myself ! I'd like to make another Advice and Trust AU ! So here is the beginning, and maybe if you think it's cool maybe the rest !  
但这并没有就此结束！我继续阅读越来越多的故事，直到其中一篇，Effybelle 的《看着我》，激发了我自己写作的欲望。你知道的，只是为了把它从我的系统里释放出来。所以我就是这么做的。问题是，现在我有点想继续下去，把它写完，我有想法，但对自己不是那么有信心！我想创作另一个《建议与信任》AU！所以这里是开始，也许如果你觉得它很酷，可能会有后续！  
  
  
_That_ Night 那个夜晚  
  
### Chapter 1
  
Another sleepless night in Tokyo-3 for the Third Child. He was laying on his bed, hid SDAT playing the same two tracks in his ears. He wasn't listening to them. He still automatically played them back to back, but white noise would have had the same effect on the boy.  
第三适格者在第三新东京市又度过了一个无眠之夜。他躺在床上，SDAT 播放器在他耳边重复播放着那两首曲子。他并没有在听。他仍然习惯性地将它们连着播放，但白噪音对这男孩来说效果是一样的。  
  
  
  
It wasn't the first night he could not sleep, he was getting used to it by now, he thought. But he had more of them since _that_ night. And it was precisely what was keeping him awake right now.  
这不是他第一次失眠，他想，他现在已经习惯了。但从那晚开始，这样的夜晚变得更多了。而正是这些记忆让他此刻无法入眠。  
  
Switching track on his SDAT, he recalled once again the events of his last day of sync training with Asuka.  
他切换了 SDAT 上的曲目，再次回想起与明日香最后一次同步训练的情景。  
  
  
  
Her genuine -or so it seemed, he still was not sure- happiness when she learned Misato wouldn't be there all night, followed by her usual fire coming back when she told him not to cross the "Impenetrable Wall of Jericho".  
当她得知美里不会整晚都在时，她那似乎发自内心的——尽管他仍不确定——快乐，紧接着在她告诉他不要越过“耶利哥之墙”时，她那惯常的怒火又回来了。  
  
  
  
He remembered everything about that, her rather revealing outfit, emphasized by her position when she said it. This image was forever carved in his teenager's brain. Her curves which he could see from her cleavage in his peripheral vision -looking at them directly would have been a death sentence-, her skin, her beautiful face even through the rage she was expressing, her big blue eyes, her flamboyant hair. Seldom did he see her without her A10 headpieces. 'She's so gorgeous', he reminded himself once again.  
他记得那一切，她那相当暴露的装扮，尤其是她说这话时的姿势。这个画面永远刻在了他青春期的脑海中。从他的余光中可以看到她的曲线——直接看过去无异于自寻死路——她的肌肤，她那即使在愤怒中也美丽的面庞，她那双大大的蓝眼睛，她那张扬的发丝。很少见她不戴 A10 头饰的样子。‘她真是太美了’，他又一次在心中提醒自己。  
  
  
  
With her hair down like that, she looked... More like a normal girl. Not the grandiose Evangelion Unit-02 Pilot she wanted everyone in the whole world to know she was, as she had told him. Just... Asuka Langley Sohryu.  
像这样放下头发的她，看起来...更像一个普通的女孩。不是她希望全世界都知道的那个宏伟的 EVA 二号机驾驶员，正如她曾告诉他的那样。只是... 惣流·明日香·兰格雷。  
  
  
  
It was precisely this idea which was keeping him awake. Again. When she whispered 'Mama...' right before he... tried to kiss her in her sleep. He wasn't too proud of that. But that wasn't important. This whisper was. He didn't realize at first. Thinking back to the abuse she put him through since she arrived in Tokyo-3... No ! She started even before on the Over The Rainbow ! His exasperation and frustration made him think she was a child just as much as he was. Nothing more.  
正是这个念头让他夜不能寐。又一次。当她在即将被他……试图在睡梦中亲吻时，轻声呢喃着“妈妈……”。他对此并不感到自豪。但那并不重要。这声低语才是关键。起初他并未意识到。回想她自来到东京-3 以来对他的种种折磨……不！甚至在“彩虹之上”时她就开始了！他的恼怒与挫败感让他觉得她不过是个孩子，和他一样，仅此而已。  
  
  
  
It wasn't before several days had passed after they both destroyed the Seventh Angel that, playing this memory back in his mind during another sleepless night, it hit him. She _was_ a child like him. And these few seconds had more meaning than he grasped at first. It was a window. An opening which showed him, albeit for a brief instant, the _real_ Asuka. He learned that night that there was more to Asuka Langley Sohryu than an arrogant bitch. He just didn't understand it at the time. Her fiery temperament, her noisiness, everything she was was just an act... Okay, maybe not just an act, it was another part of her personality, which he also was attracted to, he had to admit, even if it made no sense to him. Moreover, there was something about her mother. He had to know what, they might not be that different in the end. Or maybe she just missed her, since she had to leave Germany to come here. He had no idea, she didn't speak very much about herself.  
在他们联手摧毁第七使徒后的几天里，某个无眠之夜，他脑海中回放这段记忆时，突然领悟到了。她和他一样，是个孩子。而这短短几秒的意义，远超他起初的理解。这是一扇窗，一瞬间让他瞥见了真实的明日香。那晚他明白了，明日香·兰格雷远不止是个傲慢的婊子。只是当时他未能理解。她那火爆的脾气、吵闹的个性，一切表象都只是伪装……好吧，或许不全是伪装，那是她性格的另一面，他不得不承认，尽管这在他看来毫无逻辑，却也吸引着他。此外，她与母亲之间似乎有些故事。他必须弄清楚，或许他们最终并没有那么不同。又或许，她只是想念母亲，毕竟她为了来这里而离开了德国。他无从得知，她很少谈及自己。  
  
  
  
Since that night, he happened to ear her whimper in her sleep a few more nights through her sliding door. Seeing how her eyes had teared-up, he assumed that the story of her Mother was something that deeply scarred her. That it was not merely because she missed her. She never called her, she never even got mail. There had to be something more. But he couldn't know for sure. He had to ask her. He had to know. That train of thoughts scared Shinji a great deal. He never had a real discussion with her, and he _knew_ that if he were to ask her, he should wait for the right opportunity, or she would probably kill him on the spot.  
自那晚起，他偶然间又几次听到她从滑动门后传来的睡梦中的呜咽。看到她泪眼婆娑的样子，他猜测她母亲的故事一定深深地伤害了她。这不仅仅是因为她想念她。她从不给她打电话，甚至连信件也没有收到过。一定有更深层的原因。但他无法确定。他必须问她。他必须知道。这一连串的想法让真嗣感到非常害怕。他从未与她真正交谈过，他知道如果他要问她，必须等待合适的时机，否则她可能会当场杀了他。  
  
  
  
That being said, she didn't look as terrifying to him anymore. Something was different, even though nothing had changed on the surface. She still pushed him and shouted at him every time she had the occasion, but he knew better. She was fragile, and the only logical conclusion as to why she acted like that was because she wanted to push everyone away. But Shinji didn't want to be away from her. Not anymore, he realized. He wanted to know the real Asuka, he was more attracted to her now that he realized that she was not only a pretty face.  
尽管如此，她在他眼中已不再那么可怕。有些东西变了，尽管表面上一切如常。她依然每次有机会就推搡他、对他大喊大叫，但他更明白了。她很脆弱，她之所以那样做，唯一合理的解释是她想把所有人都推开。但真嗣不想再远离她了。他意识到，他现在想要了解真正的明日香，他发现她不仅仅是个漂亮的外表，这让他对她更加着迷。  
  
  
  
There was something he knew though, through all these theories and conjectures. He was worthless. He was a coward. A weak, dishonest coward. Even if he found the courage to confess his attraction to the girl across the hall, how could she possibly reciprocate those feelings ? She was strong and brave. She never had second thoughts about going to battle, she even liked it ! And even if he was indeed right, there was absolutely no way she could share his feelings.  
尽管有这么多理论和猜测，但他心里明白一件事。他一文不值。他是个懦夫。一个软弱、不诚实的懦夫。即使他有勇气向走廊对面的女孩坦白自己的感情，她又怎么可能回应呢？她坚强勇敢。她从不犹豫上战场，甚至乐在其中！即使他确实是对的，她也绝对不可能分享他的感情。  
  
  
  
It always ended like this. It hadn't changed since the day his father abandoned him. He always came back to this conclusion. Except that now he was an Eva Pilot. He wasn't completely worthless anymore. People looked up to him to save the world. If he weren't, he would be nothing, just like he used to. But it didn't cheer him up. He hated being an Eva pilot. He hated that it was the only thing people saw about him. They didn't care about him. He was just a tool.  
事情总是这样结束。自从父亲抛弃他的那天起，一切都没有改变。他总是得出这个结论。只是现在他成了 EVA 驾驶员。他不再完全无用。人们仰望他拯救世界。如果不是这样，他就会一无是处，就像过去一样。但这并没有让他振作起来。他讨厌成为 EVA 驾驶员。他讨厌这是人们唯一关注他的地方。他们不在乎他。他只是一个工具。  
  
  
  
It wasn't long before the Third Child started to fall asleep from exhaustion. It was late, his thoughts were getting blurry, all remained were impressions, feelings. A tiny glimmer of hope engulfed in sadness and depression.  
不久，第三适格者因疲惫开始入睡。夜已深，思绪变得模糊，剩下的只有印象和感觉。一丝微弱的希望被悲伤和抑郁所吞没。

The next morning, Shinji did everything he could to hide how tired he was, it barely shown anyway, but he was sure Asuka wouldn't get off his back -not in the way he would have liked- if she saw him tired in the morning. He wouldn't hear the end of it. Baka, hentai, pervert, I know exactly what you were up all night doing, you better hope none of my panties are missing and so on and so forth. He knew so much about the Second Child that he was able to know beforehand what she would say to him to chastise him. 'Guess these days of sync training left a bigger impression on me than I thought'.  
次日清晨，真嗣竭尽所能地掩饰自己的疲惫，尽管这几乎不显眼，但他确信如果明日香看到他早上疲惫的样子，她绝不会轻易放过他——不是他希望的那种方式。他将永无宁日。笨蛋、变态、色狼，我知道你整晚都在干什么，你最好祈祷我的内裤没少，等等等等。他对二号机驾驶员的了解如此之深，以至于能预先知道她会如何责备他。'看来这些同步训练的日子给我留下的印象比我想象的还要深'。  
  
  
  
His determination helped him focus on not showing any sign of weakness. He had to know, to find this window into her heart and reach for it. To get to know the _real_ her. She could, and would, keep on abusing him at any given time, but it didn't matter. She didn't scare him as much anymore, and everything she could say could be the opportunity he was looking for. He just had to be patient.  
他的决心帮助他专注于不显露任何弱点。他必须知道，找到通往她内心的那扇窗并伸手触及。去了解真正的她。她可以，并且会在任何时候继续虐待他，但这并不重要。她不再像以前那样让他感到害怕，她所说的每一句话都可能是他一直在寻找的机会。他只需要保持耐心。

'She's going to a blind date... It might already be too late'. He began to despair and this time _he_ was chastising himself. His usual behavior of not taking things head on had backfired yet again. He hadn't done anything in weeks. Even en Angel attacked ! 'Waiting for the right opportunity, she might be sucking faces with whatever jerk Hikari introduced her. Dammit !'  
'她要去相亲了...可能已经太迟了'。他开始感到绝望，这次是在责备自己。他一贯不直接面对问题的行为再次适得其反。他已经几周没采取任何行动了。就连天使也攻击他！'等待合适的时机，她可能正和光里介绍的任何一个混蛋亲热呢。该死！'  
  
  
  
But he had other things to focus on. He went to visit his mother's grave with his father this day. Spending time with him had not been unpleasant, but he couldn't say much more than that. He was still as cold as ever. Seeing his mother soothed him though, in a way. It had been three years since last time. A visit to her grave was long overdue.  
但他还有其他事情要关注。这天，他和父亲一起去探望母亲的墓。与父亲共度时光并不令人不快，但也仅此而已。他依旧冷漠如初。不过，看到母亲确实以某种方式安抚了他。距离上次已经三年了。探望她的墓已经拖得太久了。  
  
  
  
But as soon as he came back home, he couldn't occupy his mind anymore. He tried everything he could. He couldn't focus on his homework, so he decided to do the laundry, with Asuka's clothes... and underwear. He still did it, but it didn't help. He tried to watch TV but nothing managed to get his attention off the redhead and her jerk of a date. In a last-ditch effort, he went in his room and grabbed his SDAT. It always helped him escape the world and its worries, but it didn't prevent him from thinking. It never had and he knew that.  
但一回到家，他就再也无法集中思绪。他尝试了所有办法。无法专心做作业，于是决定洗衣服，包括明日香的衣物和内衣。他还是做了，但无济于事。试图看电视，却没有任何节目能让他不去想那个红发女孩和她那混蛋约会对象。最后，他走进房间，拿起 SDAT 播放器。它总能帮他逃离现实世界的烦恼，却无法阻止他思考。这一点从未改变，他心知肚明。  
  
  
  
There was still something he hadn't tried. He picked up his cello case, retrieved his cello from inside and went to sit down on one of the kitchen's chairs. After a bit of tuning, he started playing. It had been a while since he had last played, so his first few notes were hesitant, but it soon came back to him. He lost track of time while playing, it worked on his thoughts, he was fully focused on the music. When he felt he shook off the rust enough, he started playing Bach's Cello Suite No 1. He loved this piece, how complicated it was, yet how beautiful, how every notes flowed, how it put this beautiful instrument at the center of attention. As the piece reached its ending, Shinji's mind was blank, he finally managed to get some peace of mind, nothing would disturb him...  
还有些方法他未曾尝试。他拿起大提琴盒，从中取出大提琴，坐在厨房的一把椅子上。调音片刻后，他开始演奏。已经有一段时间没拉琴了，最初几个音符显得有些迟疑，但很快便找回了感觉。他沉浸在演奏中，忘记了时间，音乐影响着他的思绪，他全神贯注于旋律之中。当他觉得技艺已恢复得差不多时，便开始演奏巴赫的大提琴组曲第一号。他钟爱这首曲子，既复杂又美丽，每个音符都流畅自如，将这件美妙的乐器置于聚光灯下。随着曲子接近尾声，真嗣的思绪变得空白，他终于获得了些许内心的平静，没有什么能再打扰他...  
  
  
  
Clap clap clap.  啪啪啪。  
  
  
  
This sound brought him back in reality at the speed of light. Someone else was here. He turned his head and saw Asuka on the threshold of the kitchen. She was still applauding him.  
这声音如闪电般将他拉回现实。还有别人在这里。他转过头，看到明日香站在厨房门口，仍在为他鼓掌。  
  
  
  
"Not bad at all. I didn't know you played." 'She's here !' he thought. 'Something must have happened, it might not be too late after all !' He focused all his energy on not showing how happy he was to see her this early.  
"相当不错。我之前不知道你会弹。" '她在这里！' 他心想。'一定发生了什么事，也许还不算太晚！' 他竭尽全力不让自己表现出见到她如此早的喜悦。  
  
  
  
"I've been studying since I was five, but I'm not very good. I don't really have any talent." 'I have to know what happened, I have to ask her when I get the chance', talking about how he started playing cello helped him keep is composure.  
"我从五岁就开始学习，但我不太擅长。我并没有什么天赋。" '我必须知道发生了什么，有机会一定要问她'，谈论他如何开始拉大提琴帮助他保持镇定。  
  
  
  
"Perseverance is power. I'm impressed." 'Did she just... Compliment me ? If I had knew that would happen, I would have retrieved it earlier !'  
"坚持就是力量。我很佩服。" '她刚刚... 是在夸我吗？如果早知道会这样，我应该早点把它拿回来的！'  
  
  
  
"I started studying because my teacher told me to, but I could have quit anytime."  
“我开始学习是因为老师让我这么做，但我本可以随时放弃的。”  
  
  
  
"So, why didn't you ?"  
“那么，你为什么不呢？”  
  
  
  
"Because nobody told me to stop."  
“因为没有人告诉我停下来。”  
  
  
  
"I should have known." 'Now is a good time, go !'  
"我早该料到的。" '现在正是时候，去吧！'  
  
  
  
"You came back early, I thought you'd have dinner too."  
"你回来得真早，我还以为你会一起吃晚饭呢。"  
  
  
  
"He was just so boring ! So, while he was waiting in line for the roller coaster, I left." 'Yes !' He was really happy when he heard that. Finally he could relax and stop thinking she would be even more out of reach than she already was. He had to keep is composure though.  
"他实在太无聊了！所以，当他排队等过山车时，我就离开了。" '太好了！' 他听到这个消息时真的很高兴。终于可以放松一下，不再担心她会比现在更加遥不可及。不过，他得保持镇定。  
  
  
  
"That's harsh."  “真苛刻。”  
  
  
  
"Really, Kaji is the only cool guy." And with that, Asuka shot him right through the heart. He was still a child, he was still not worthy enough for her...  
“真的，加持是唯一一个酷的人。”说完这话，明日香直击他的心脏。他还是个孩子，他还不够资格得到她……

Asuka was sitting on a chair, her head laying on her hand on the kitchen table. Shinji was seating on the threshold, reading while listening to his SDAT.  
明日香坐在椅子上，头靠在放在餐桌上的手上。真嗣坐在门槛上，一边听着他的 SDAT 一边阅读。  
  
  
  
"Hey, Shinji, do you want to kiss me ?" she asked, her voice was monotone.  
“嘿，真嗣，你想吻我吗？”她问道，声音毫无起伏。  
  
  
  
"What ?" Shinji heard what she said, but wasn't sure he actually believed it. He took off his headset.  
“什么？”真嗣听到了她的话，但不确定自己是否真的相信。他摘下了耳机。  
  
  
  
"A kiss. A kiss ? You've never kissed a girl, have you ?" 'Where is this coming from ? And more importantly, where is this going ?'  
“一个吻。一个吻？你从未吻过女孩，对吧？”‘这从何说起？更重要的是，这会走向何方？’  
  
  
  
He shook his head  
他摇了摇头  
  
  
  
"Then let's do it." 'This is a trick. This has to be a trick. She is just pushing me.' he thought, jumping when he heard her.  
“那就这么做吧。”‘这是个圈套。这一定是圈套。她只是在逼我。’他想着，听到她的声音时吓了一跳。  
  
  
  
"But why ?" “但为什么？”  
  
  
  
"Because I'm bored" 'I don't buy it, I know where this is going. She's going to call me a hentai again... That being said... Maybe it's the only chance I'll get.'  
"因为我觉得无聊" '我才不信，我知道她葫芦里卖的什么药。她又要骂我是变态了...尽管如此...也许这是我唯一的机会。'  
  
  
  
"Is that a reason ?!" He knew he was blushing, he couldn't look her in the eyes.  
"这算什么理由？！" 他知道自己脸红了，不敢直视她的眼睛。  
  
  
  
"Do you not want to kiss on the anniversary of your mom's death ?" She was definitely pushing him now. And hurting him doing so. But this time he saw the opportunity he had longed for for so long.  
"你不想在妈妈忌日那天接吻吗？" 她现在肯定是在逼他。而且这样做让他很受伤。但这次他看到了自己期盼已久的那个机会。  
  
  
  
"And what about _your_ mother, Asuka ?"  
“那你的母亲呢，明日香？”  
  
  
  
Asuka looked at him, her blue eyes wide. She was utterly shocked at Shinji's question. Where did that come from ? Tears already started gathering in her eyes, she was still looking at him, trying to come up with something to answer him. Something that would hurt him, preferably. But nothing came. After a few seconds, she stood up and stormed out of the kitchen and into her room. Shinji studied her reaction and felt guilty about how he brought it up. He saw how hurt she looked. Maybe he shouldn't have said anything. It was too late now, he couldn't let this be the conclusion of their discussion. He stood up and went to her room. The sliding door was ajar, it bounced back when she slammed it.  
明日香看着他，蓝色的眼睛睁得大大的。她对真嗣的问题感到完全震惊。这问题从何而来？泪水已经开始在她的眼眶中聚集，她仍然盯着他，试图想出一些话来回答他。最好是能伤害他的话。但什么也没想出来。几秒钟后，她站起来，冲出厨房，跑进自己的房间。真嗣观察着她的反应，对自己提起这件事感到内疚。他看到了她受伤的表情。也许他不该说什么的。但现在为时已晚，他不能让这次讨论就这样结束。他站起来，走向她的房间。滑动门半开着，她用力一推，门反弹回来。  
  
"Asuka ?" He said, entering her room, closing the door behind him and switching the light on. She was laying on her bed, facing the wall. Silent tears were rolling down to her pillow. She was not going to give the Third Child the satisfaction of seeing this, she thought. She was used to this, crying in silence, not showing anything.  
“明日香？”他说着，走进她的房间，关上门并打开灯。她躺在床上，面朝墙壁。无声的泪水顺着脸颊滑落到枕头上。她不想让第三适格者看到这一幕，她想。她已经习惯了，默默哭泣，不表露任何情感。  
  
  
  
"Go away !" She shouted with all the rage she could muster. And right now, she had a lot. 'Don't abandon me' her mind echoed. 'I don't want to be alone, it's a pain.'  
“走开！”她用尽全力怒吼道。此刻，她的愤怒无比强烈。‘不要抛弃我’她的内心回响着。‘我不想孤单一人，那太痛苦了。’  
  
  
  
"Asuka, it's really difficult to be around you sometimes."  
“有时候，和你相处真的很困难，明日香。”  
  
  
  
"Then. Go. Away. Now !" Shinji shivered when he heard her shout, full of wrath, but there was something more too, her sadness. He wouldn't leave her like that. Especially because he was responsible.  
“那就。走。开。现在！”真嗣听到她的怒吼，浑身颤抖，但其中还夹杂着更多的东西，她的悲伤。他不能就这样离开她。尤其是因为他也有责任。  
  
  
  
None of them paid attention to the front door of the apartment sliding open and closing soon after. Misato wouldn't come see them anyway.  
他们谁也没有注意到公寓的前门悄然滑开，随即又关上了。反正美里也不会来看他们。  
  
  
  
"No. And I won't apologize for what I said, " She smiled a little into her pillow when he said that, she hid it from him. "but I'll tell you something. My mother died when I was around three years old. Soon after, my father abandoned me. I was raised by a teacher outside of Tokyo-3. I have been alone for 10 years, no friends, nothing except my teacher. Today I went to visit my mother, and my father told me that she wasn't even there, that her grave was empty. He also told me that he destroyed everything about her. There are no pictures left of her, nothing..." his voice broke when a sob escaped his mouth "I don't even remember her !" he was crying now. He never told anyone that much about him.  
“不，我不会为我说的话道歉。”她听到他这么说时，在枕头上微微一笑，却没让他看见。“但我要告诉你一件事。我三岁左右时母亲去世了，不久后父亲也抛弃了我。我在第三新东京市外由一位老师抚养长大。十年来，我孤身一人，除了老师，没有朋友，什么都没有。今天我去看了母亲，父亲却告诉我那里根本没有人，她的墓是空的。他还告诉我，关于她的一切都被他毁掉了。现在连她的照片都没有留下，什么都没有……”他的声音哽咽了，一个呜咽从他嘴里逃出，“我甚至不记得她了！”他现在哭了起来。他从没对任何人说过这么多关于自己的事。  
  
  
  
Asuka sat on her bed when he finished, she was shook by his confession. It sounded really close to her own story, she thought. She looked at him for some time.  
他讲完后，明日香坐在自己的床上，他的坦白让她震惊。她觉得他的故事与自己的经历非常相似。她注视了他好一会儿。  
  
  
  
"... I... Shouldn't have... I didn't know..." It was her way of apologizing to him, he thought, but at that time he didn't care. He opened to someone, she listened and all this pain he built up inside finally broke out.  
"...我...本不该...我不知道..." 他想，这是她向他道歉的方式，但那时他并不在意。他向某人敞开了心扉，她聆听着，而他内心积压的痛苦终于爆发了出来。  
  
  
  
"Thanks for opening up to me", she said to break the silence, but she genuinely meant it. It was something new to her, and she wanted to understand why he did this. Sure, there was the obvious reason that he wanted to explain her how she hurt him, but that wasn't like him. When he was hurt... When she hurt him, he closed himself. That's how he reacted. He went to his room and listened to his SDAT. What did it mean ? Did it mean that they were friends ? It sure looked like that, but her guts told her there was something more. Was it because he trusted her ? 'Does he... Need me ? Does he care about me ? How much ?..' The thought was almost too much to handle. She already had it before. Mainly because as much as she picked fights with him, she cared about him too. He was always there, he always came back. Everyone in her life before just didn't care or gave up after being shoved a few times, but not him. And having seen him retort to her, sharing his secrets with her, she understood it was yet again Shinji Ikari reaching out to her. Like nobody ever did. This time she couldn't shove him away again, she had to think of something. Quick !  
"谢谢你向我敞开心扉。" 她打破沉默说道，但她是真心这么想的。这对她来说是件新鲜事，她想弄明白他为何这么做。当然，显而易见的原因是他想向她解释她如何伤害了他，但这不像他的风格。当他受伤时……当她伤害他时，他会封闭自己。他就是这样反应的。他会回到自己的房间，听他的 SDAT。这意味着什么？难道这意味着他们是朋友？看起来确实如此，但她的直觉告诉她还有更多。是因为他信任她吗？'他是否……需要我？他在乎我吗？有多在乎？……'这个念头几乎让她难以承受。她之前也有过这种感觉。主要是因为尽管她经常和他吵架，但她也很在乎他。他总是在那里，他总会回来。她生命中之前的每个人都漠不关心或在被推开几次后放弃，但他没有。看到他回击她，向她分享他的秘密，她明白这又是碇真嗣向她伸出手。像从未有人做过的一样。这次她不能再推开他，她必须想点办法。快！  
  
  
  
"Hey Baka ? Instead of a kiss, how about a hug ?" With the tone of her voice, it was clear that she wasn't insulting him this time, just a way to get his attention.  
“嘿，笨蛋？不接吻的话，抱一下怎么样？”她的语气表明这次她并非在侮辱他，只是想引起他的注意。  
  
  
  
He nodded. He was crying a bit less now. She came closer to him and took him in her arms, she wasn't facing her so she was hugging her side. After a few seconds, Shinji shifted and hugged her back. They both relaxed in each other's arms. They could feel each other's warmth, but more importantly, they both felt warm inside. They both really wanted and needed that hug, so they stayed like that a long time, neither one of them wanted to break their embrace. Asuka broke the silence, however.  
他点点头。现在他哭得少些了。她靠近他，将他拥入怀中，她没有面对他，所以是侧身拥抱。几秒钟后，真嗣动了动，也回抱了她。两人在彼此的怀抱中放松下来。他们能感受到对方的温暖，但更重要的是，他们内心都感到温暖。两人都非常渴望并需要这个拥抱，所以他们就这样长时间地拥抱着，谁也不想打破这份拥抱。然而，明日香打破了沉默。  
  
  
  
"Look at you, Third Child, finally growing a spine !" she said, mock-insulting him.  
“看看你，第三适格者，终于有点骨气了！”她戏谑地说道，假装在挖苦他。  
  
  
  
"I knew you had a heart, _Second Child_ ! He tried to put as much disdain as he could in those last words, but he didn't sound very convincing. They laughed against each other and stayed locked in their embrace for some time after before loosening their grip, but Shinji kept his arms around Asuka's waist, and she kept her arm around his neck.  
"我就知道你有一颗心，二号机驾驶员！" 他尽力在最后几个字中注入尽可能多的轻蔑，但听起来并不那么令人信服。他们相视而笑，在拥抱中停留了好一会儿才松开，但真嗣仍环抱着明日香的腰，而她也将手臂搭在他的脖颈上。  
  
  
  
This hug meant the world to Shinji, it had been as if time had stopped, that nothing else but them existed. He made the most of it, of the contact between them, her warmth, her scent... He hadn't been hugged since... He couldn't remember. And it was her that was hugging him ! His sorrow was a bit easier to cope with thanks to her. 'She has done this to reach out to me ! She would never have done this normally.' They just shared, no, they were still sharing a moment of genuine and thorough happiness together, right after they hurt each other and he let it all out before her. This moment was the happiest he felt in years. They were still hugging while looking in each others' eyes. He seemed to notice something different in them. He wasn't sure. Probably nothing, he thought. He couldn't analyze anything right now, he was still enthralled by her beauty, he wanted to kiss her. Right now. His mind raced. 'What's wrong with me ? Am I stupid enough to ruin everything because I would die to kiss her right now ? She looks so beautiful, il feels so good to be in her arms. You're still in her arms right now Ikari ! This has to mean something ! She could have let me go a -long- while ago, and I'm still discussing whether I should kiss her ?! But if I kiss her, she might go back to chastising me, she might lock herself away again. She would probably kill me for that kind of boldness. But then again, I would die with a smile on my face, so that wouldn't be so bad.' he thought amusedly. 'Plus, she wanted us to kiss earlier. Out of boredom, maybe, but that still counts, right ? Ah dammit Ikari, for once in your life, stop thinking and ACT !'  
这个拥抱对真嗣来说意味着整个世界，仿佛时间停滞，世间万物都不复存在，唯有他们二人。他尽情享受着这份接触，她的温暖，她的香气……自从……他记不清了，已经很久没有人拥抱过他。而此刻，是她在拥抱他！多亏了她，他的悲伤稍稍减轻了些。“她这样做是为了接近我！平时她绝不会这样。”他们刚刚分享了，不，他们仍在共享一段真挚而彻底的幸福时光，就在彼此伤害之后，他当着她的面宣泄了一切。这一刻，是他多年来感受到的最快乐的时刻。他们依旧紧紧相拥，凝视着对方的眼睛。他似乎察觉到了一丝异样，但又不确定，或许只是错觉。他此刻无法分析任何事情，仍沉醉于她的美丽之中，渴望亲吻她，就在此刻。他的思绪飞速运转，“我这是怎么了？难道我会因为此刻宁愿死也要吻她而毁了一切吗？她看起来如此美丽，被她拥抱着感觉如此美好。你现在还在她的怀抱中，碇真嗣！这一定意味着什么！” 她本可以在很久以前就让我离开，而我还在纠结是否应该吻她？！但如果我吻了她，她可能会回到责备我的状态，她可能会再次把自己封闭起来。她很可能会因为我这种大胆行为而杀了我。但话说回来，我会带着微笑死去，那也不算太糟。'他想着，觉得有趣。'而且，她之前想让我们接吻。也许是因为无聊，但那也算数，对吧？啊该死，碇，这辈子就这一次，别再想了，行动吧！'  
  
He leaned to close the gap between them and put his lips on hers. Surprised at this contact, she jumped and backed off reflexively, startling Shinji.  
他倾身缩短了他们之间的距离，将嘴唇贴在她的唇上。对这个接触感到惊讶，她本能地跳开并后退，这让真嗣吃了一惊。  
  
  
  
"Why did you do that for ?!" She didn't sound too angry, more surprised than anything.  
“你为什么要这么做？！”她的声音听起来并不太生气，更多的是惊讶。  
  
  
  
Shinji, trying to conceal how pained he was at this sudden rejection, remained silent for a minute. He looked away.  
真嗣试图掩饰自己因这突如其来的拒绝而感到的痛苦，沉默了一会儿。他转过头去。  
  
  
  
"I... I wanted to make sure you weren't bored ?" This answer made her smile a little, but she wouldn't let go like this.  
“我……我想确认你不会觉得无聊？”这个回答让她微微一笑，但她并没有就此罢休。  
  
  
  
"No. I want a serious answer Ikari."  
“不，我要一个认真的回答，碇。”  
  
  
  
Shinji knew he couldn't escape. Not that his legs would have carried him right now anyway. He was scared, but he knew he had to stand his ground. He couldn't run away. Regaining his composure, he answered the Second Child after a few seconds.  
真嗣知道他逃不掉。再说，他的腿现在也根本跑不动。他害怕，但他知道自己必须站稳脚跟。他不能逃跑。几秒钟后，他恢复了镇定，回答了二号适格者。  
  
  
  
"First, I've always been attracted to you. At least physically." He wasn't stuttering, he was scared, he didn't want to lose her, but he had wanted to say those words to her for so long that he emanated an aura of confidence that surprised him more than anyone else. "But then something happened... Do you remember the last night of our sync training ?  
"“首先，我一直对你有感觉。至少是身体上的。”他没有结巴，他害怕，他不想失去她，但他早就想对她说这些话了，以至于他散发出一种自信的气场，连他自己都感到惊讶。“但后来发生了一些事……你还记得我们同步训练的最后一晚吗？”  
  
  
  
"When you kissed me in my sleep ?" She asked sarcastically. She didn't want to, she was _very_ focused on what he had to say, but her words escaped her mouth before she even realized they did.  
"“你在我睡着时吻了我？”她带着讽刺的口吻问道。她本不想这样，她非常专注于他想说的话，但话却脱口而出，连她自己都没意识到。”  
  
  
  
"Tried to. Not that it is much better, but can we not delve on that for now ? Please ?" Now that it was out of the way, she focused back on his answer. He would pay her back for this attempted kiss, but she would wait. She nodded. "You cried in your sleep." he continued "About your mother. I didn't understand it at the time, but I later realized that there was more to you than what you showed. That I wanted to know the _real_ you. That the Asuka I knew was only what you agreed to show me. And I hated that you had nightmares like that. That the brave and confident girl in front of me could be so sad that it had to come out at night ! I wanted to help you !" He was tearing up again, which moved her. He truly was concerned about her. "That's why I asked you this question earlier. And that's also why I kissed you."  
"“尝试过。虽然这没好到哪儿去，但我们能不能暂时不谈这个？拜托了？”既然已经说开了，她重新专注于他的回答。他会为这个尝试的吻付出代价，但她会等待。她点点头。“你在睡梦中哭了。”他继续说，“关于你母亲。我当时没理解，但后来我意识到你比表面展现的更多。我想了解真正的你。我所认识的明日香只是你同意展示给我的那一面。我讨厌你有那样的噩梦。那个在我面前勇敢自信的女孩会如此悲伤，以至于只能在夜晚流露出来！我想帮助你！”他又开始流泪，这让她感动。他真的关心她。“这就是我之前问你这个问题的原因。这也是我吻你的原因。””  
  
  
  
"It's been weeks since that night ! Why did you take so long ?" Some of her usual fire was back in her voice, as well as a tint of joy, almost bliss at what he had just said. He didn't notice it.  
"那晚之后已经过去几周了！你为什么耽搁这么久？" 她的声音里恢复了一些往日的锐气，还带着一丝喜悦，几乎是对他刚刚所说的话的陶醉。他并未察觉。  
  
  
  
"I took the first opportunity I had. I couldn't come to you out of the blue and ask you about your mother !" he said defensively.  
"我抓住了第一个机会。我总不能突然跑来问你关于你母亲的事吧！" 他辩解道。  
  
  
  
"That's kind of what you did."  
"你差不多就是这么做的。"  
  
  
  
"I know ! You talked about my mother, it just came out !"  
“我知道！你提到了我妈妈，话就脱口而出了！”  
  
  
  
"It was harsh." “那话确实刺耳。”  
  
  
  
"Again, it was the only opportunity I had in weeks to get you to open-up to me !"  
“再说，这是我几周来唯一能让你对我敞开心扉的机会！”  
  
  
  
'He wanted me to open-up to him. He truly cares about me.' This tint of joy was getting bigger and bigger as he kept justifying himself "And what good did it do, Third Child ? I haven't opened-up to you." She didn't know why, but she still had to push him. To test his resolve, maybe.  
'他希望我能向他敞开心扉。他真的关心我。' 这种喜悦的色彩在他不断为自己辩解时变得越来越浓，"那么这有什么好处呢，三子？我并没有向你敞开心扉。" 她不知道为什么，但她仍然需要推动他。也许是想考验他的决心。  
  
  
  
"But you did ! You're right, I don't know more about you than yesterday, but you apologized to me, you even hugged me !" He paused, looking back at her, she was smiling. "I don't want to push you, so if you don't want to tell me about anything you don't have to. I can wait. I'll always be there for you." He couldn't believe what he had said. It wasn't a confession per se, but it didn't leave much room for interpretation. He didn't even realize before saying this that it was how he felt about her. He closed his eyes as he expected the worst.  
"但你确实做到了！你说得对，我对你的了解并不比昨天多，但你向我道歉了，你甚至拥抱了我！" 他停顿了一下，回头看着她，她在微笑。"我不想逼你，所以如果你不想告诉我任何事情，你不必说。我可以等。我会一直在你身边。" 他简直不敢相信自己说了什么。这虽然不算正式的告白，但也几乎没有解释的余地。在说出口之前，他甚至没有意识到自己对她的感觉是这样的。他闭上眼睛，等待着最坏的结果。  
  
  
  
He didn't wait long as Asuka hugged him once again, more tightly this time. He hugged her back, surprised, but happy to feel her once more this close to him. After some time, she pulled back just enough to look him in the eyes.  
他没等多久，因为明日香再次紧紧地拥抱了他。他回抱她，惊讶但高兴能再次如此近距离地感受到她。过了一会儿，她稍稍后退，足以直视他的眼睛。  
  
"You know... I don't want to do this out of boredom anymore..." she said before leaning to kiss him passionately. He was even more surprised this time, but he went with it, with all his love. They kissed for a long time, each expressing with this kiss the feelings they couldn't put into words. She finally broke it and leaned her head on his shoulder.  
“你知道吗……我不想再因为无聊而做这件事了……”她边说边倾身深情地吻他。这次他更加惊讶，但还是全心全意地回应了她。他们久久地拥吻，用这个吻表达了那些难以言表的情感。她终于结束了这个吻，将头靠在他的肩上。  
  
  
  
"... Baka." she whispered to finish her sentence, tears of joy forming in the corner of her eyes.  
“……笨蛋。”她轻声说完这句话，眼角泛起了喜悦的泪花。

### Chapter 2 : Innocent when you dream
I haven't posted those here, but I have two new chapters that I added on ff.net, so I might as well post them here !  
我还没在这里发布那些章节，但我已经在 ff.net 上添加了两篇新章节，所以不妨也在这里发布一下！  
  
They stayed like this for a long time, locked in their embrace, both completely oblivious to the outside world. Both of them enjoying the other's warmth and silent comfort. Hence, they never saw the eyes watching them from the ajar door.  
他们就这样长时间地拥抱着，完全沉浸在自己的世界里，对外界一无所知。两人都享受着对方的温暖和无声的慰藉。因此，他们从未注意到从半开的门缝中窥视的目光。  
  
  
  
'Good for you kids !' Kaji thought before leaving, not willing to invade their privacy any longer, He walked away discreetly, leaving the apartment. He could have been the worst spy on Earth, the Children wouldn't have noticed him. They looked appeased, but it was only from the outside.  
'孩子们真不错！' 加治心想，然后离开了，不愿再侵犯他们的隐私。他悄悄地走开，离开了公寓。他可能是地球上最糟糕的间谍，孩子们根本不会注意到他。他们看起来很平静，但这只是表面上的。  
  
  
  
Asuka's mind raced. 'This feels nice... But I can't ! This is wrong ! Sure, he said some nice things, but this doesn't change anything ! He still is this pathetic little wimp ! This... _boy_ ! I want... No. I _deserve_ a man, a real man, like Kaji. This poor excuse even for a boy doesn't cut it ! It can't !' Even if she was arguing with herself, trying to come up with reasons, or excuses, to reject him, she was still holding him, her head comfortably nuzzled on his shoulder, and it was slowly rocking with his breathing. 'He's an insufferable doormat ! Always apologizing for nothing, always moping ! Yet I'm still in his arms, and I don't want to leave... I guess he can also be quite brave when we fight... And he saved my life ! He didn't hesitate one second before jumping inside a volcano without protection to save me. He caught me just a few seconds after the cable finally gave way, so he must have jumped even before he knew it would. Just to save me. Come to think of it, he's always been there for me... I keep pushing him away, like everyone else in my life, and he keeps coming back. And Gott knows I pushed him away. I've never addressed him without insulting him, I mean, he never answers back ! It's too easy ! I've even hurt him physically !.. And yet he keeps coming back... Could he _really_ mean what he said ? Could he... Love me ?.. He keeps coming back...'  
明日香思绪如潮。'这种感觉真好...但我不能！这是错的！没错，他说了些好听的话，但这改变不了什么！他依旧是那个可怜兮兮的小懦夫！这个...男孩！我想要...不。我值得一个真正的男人，像加持那样的男人。这个连男孩都算不上的家伙根本不行！不可能！'尽管她在内心争辩，试图找出理由或借口来拒绝他，她依然抱着他，头舒适地靠在他的肩上，随着他的呼吸缓缓摇晃。'他是个无可救药的受气包！总是为无谓的事道歉，总是闷闷不乐！然而我还在他怀里，我不想离开...我想他在战斗中也能相当勇敢...而且他救了我的命！他在没有任何保护的情况下毫不犹豫地跳进火山口来救我。电缆断裂后几秒钟他就接住了我，说明他肯定是在知道会断之前就跳了。只为了救我。仔细想想，他一直在我身边...我像对待生活中其他人一样推开他，而他总是回来。上帝知道我推开过他多少次。 我每次跟他说话都是在侮辱他，我是说，他从不回嘴！太简单了！我甚至对他动了手！……然而他却一再回来……他真的那么说吗？他……爱我吗？……他一再回来……'  
  
  
  
"You know ? You're not as bad as I thought"  
“你知道吗？你没我想的那么坏。”  
  
  
  
"Erm... Thanks ?" Shinji answered, not sure if it was meant as a compliment or and insult. She always had a way to make him doubt every "praise" she addressed him.  
“呃... 谢谢？” 真嗣回答道，不确定这是在夸奖还是侮辱。她总有办法让他对她的每一句“赞美”都产生怀疑。  
  
  
  
"Don't get me wrong, you're still just a dumb idiot. But I can't deny that all of what happened was kinda nice. But don't think that'll change anything !  
“别误会，你还是个笨蛋。但我不能否认发生的一切都挺不错的。不过别以为这会改变什么！”  
  
  
  
'I know', he thought bitterly. She had broke their embrace and was gesturing to emphasize what she was saying.  
‘我知道’，他苦涩地想。她已经挣脱了拥抱，正用手势强调她的话。  
  
  
  
"But you made a good choice !", she kept going, trying to sound as much as her usual haughty character as possible. "Maybe it could prove beneficial to you ! After all, it is _I_, Asuka Langley Soryu who kissed you ! You should feel honored ! And thankful that you are still alive ! Though I must tell you that I will kill you if you speak of these events to anyone... And maybe you'll be less of a wimp thanks to me ! Don't thank me. Even I, sometimes, am willing to help."  
“但你做出了一个明智的选择！”她继续说道，尽量保持自己一贯高傲的语气。“也许这对你有好处！毕竟，是我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷吻了你！你应该感到荣幸！还要庆幸你还活着！不过我得告诉你，如果这些事你敢对任何人提起，我会杀了你……也许有了我的帮助，你会变得不那么懦弱！不用谢我。即便是我，偶尔也愿意伸出援手。”  
  
  
  
'So this is it ? It didn't mean anything to her ? It was 'kinda nice' ?' Shinji couldn't believe his ears. He felt his heart sink as his anger started to rise. 'This was the best thing of my life. I can't remember being this happy before and it was nothing to you ? Why do you always have to push me away ? Why can't you accept me ? I want to be close to you. Always ! But it hurts too much. Especially because I know the answers to these questions. I'm weak, I'm selfish... I'm a coward. Who could stand to be close to me ?' He visibly slumped as these thoughts formed into his mind.  
‘就这样吗？对她来说这毫无意义？只是“挺不错”的？’真嗣不敢相信自己的耳朵。他感到心如沉石，怒气开始升腾。‘这是我生命中最美好的时刻。我记不清自己曾如此快乐过，而对你来说却一文不值？为什么你总是要把我推开？为什么你不能接受我？我想靠近你。永远！但这样太痛苦了。尤其是因为我知道这些问题的答案。我软弱，我自私……我是个懦夫。谁又能忍受与我亲近呢？’随着这些念头在脑海中成型，他明显地萎靡了下来。  
  
  
  
"I should go back to my room... Good night." He said, defeated, his voice hollow as he stood up.  
“我该回房间了……晚安。”他无力地说道，声音空洞，站起身来。  
  
  
  
"No. Don't..." 'Abandon me'. Asuka whispered, turning away from him to hide her face, as she couldn't hide the fear and sadness at what he said.  
“不，不要……”‘抛弃我’。明日香低声说着，转过身去避开他的目光，试图掩饰她因他的话而流露出的恐惧和悲伤。  
  
  
  
He could have missed it, her whisper was barely audible, but he heard it as if she had shouted right in his ear.  
他本可能错过她的低语，那声音几乎听不见，但他却听得清清楚楚，仿佛她就在他耳边大喊。  
  
  
  
'Asuka... What do you mean ? What do I do ? Are you still toying with me ? I want to stay with you Asuka. I want to get to know you. All of you... She kissed me. She held me... And now... I mustn't run away. I shouldn't run away... I...' He felt his resolve harden as his fist clenched and unclenched instinctively. 'I don't want to run away. Not from her.'  
‘明日香……你是什么意思？我该怎么做？你还在戏弄我吗？我想和你在一起，明日香。我想了解你。全部的你……她吻了我。她拥抱了我……而现在……我不能逃跑。我不该逃跑……我……’他感到自己的决心愈发坚定，拳头不由自主地握紧又松开。‘我不想逃跑。不是从她身边。’  
  
  
  
His decision made, he took a first step towards the door.  
决心已下，他迈出了走向门口的第一步。  
  
  
  
'He abandons me too. He is like everyone else. Like Papa, like Mama. I'm all alone, I've always been alone.' Asuka couldn't look in his direction. She tried not to show anything, but she knew that she wasn't very convincing. She heard the door close and after that, the light went off. That wasn't the right order, she thought, so she turned her head and saw Shinji's silhouette coming back to her bed. Relieved, she smiled at him, who barely saw it in the dark room, before shifting on her bed to leave him a spot and turned her back to him.  
“他也抛弃了我。他和所有人一样。像爸爸，像妈妈。我孤身一人，我一直是孤身一人。”明日香无法直视他的方向。她试图不露声色，但她知道自己并不太有说服力。她听到门关上的声音，随后灯光熄灭了。她心想，这顺序不对，于是转过头，看到真嗣的轮廓回到她的床边。松了一口气，她向他微笑，尽管在昏暗的房间里他几乎看不见，然后她在床上挪动位置，为他腾出空间，并背对着他。  
  
  
  
"You turn in the other direction too, and don't get any funny ideas, Third Child." she said, still smiling.  
“你也转过去，别有什么奇怪的想法，第三适格者。”她依然微笑着说。  
  
  
  
Shinji smiled too at this comment and laid on her bed. "Good night, Asuka."  
对此，真嗣也微笑着回应，然后躺在了她的床上。“晚安，明日香。”  
  
  
  
.

When Shinji woke up, he wasn't surprised to see a once familiar ceiling that he hadn't seen since he got kicked out of his room by the same person he had shared a bed with last night. What surprised him, however, was that the redhead who claimed this room to herself had her head on his chest and an arm across from him. And that he was holding her too. He couldn't see her face but he knew she was still asleep for several reasons. First, it was still pretty early in the morning, even for him to wake up, which was the second reason. He always was the first one up, which gave him time to himself and also to prepare breakfast for the three of them. The third reason was that he hadn't been awakened by said redhead's fury. Because she wouldn't let this pass. Even after what happened last night. She told him not to get any funny ideas... And they are sleeping like _this_ ?  
当真嗣醒来时，看到那曾经熟悉的天花板并不意外，自从他被昨晚同床共枕的那个人赶出房间后，他就再也没见过这景象。然而，让他惊讶的是，那个宣称这房间归她所有的红发女孩，此刻正枕在他的胸口，一只手臂横在他身上，而他也在抱着她。他看不到她的脸，但他知道她还在睡，原因有几点。首先，时间还很早，连他通常醒来的时间都还没到，这是第二个原因。他总是第一个起床，这给了他独处的时间，也为他们三人准备早餐。第三个原因是，他并没有被那位红发女孩的怒气吵醒。因为她不会就这样放过他。即使昨晚发生了那样的事。她告诉他不要有任何奇怪的想法……但他们现在却这样睡着？  
  
  
  
That being said, he quickly realized that he couldn't move. Not without waking her up. And Asuka wasn't known for her patience, especially in the morning. To prove his theory, Shinji tried a slight movement, which was quickly interrupted by the arm across him tightening its grip slightly.  
话虽如此，他很快意识到自己动弹不得。不吵醒她是不可能的。而明日香以缺乏耐心著称，尤其是在早晨。为了验证自己的猜想，真嗣尝试轻微移动，却被横在身上的手臂稍稍收紧了束缚。  
  
'She seems so peaceful.' He thought, turning his head to look at the alarm clock. 'It's still early, I could go back to sleep for an hour or so... And if she wakes up before me, she might not be too mad. Wishful thinking, I know. But maybe she'll accept that we just finished like this during our sleep.' With that, he closed his eyes again and squeezed Asuka gently, making her purr contentedly.  
‘她看起来如此宁静。’他心想，转头看向闹钟。‘时间还早，我可以再睡一个小时左右……如果她在我之前醒来，或许不会太生气。我知道这是奢望。但也许她会接受我们只是在睡梦中这样结束。’想到这里，他再次闭上眼睛，轻轻拥紧明日香，让她满意地发出呼噜声。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
'I haven't slept that well in ages ! Just having him next to me was enough to have a good night sleep, for once. I feel warm... And his heartbeat is really soothing... Wait ! Heartbeat ?  
‘我已经很久没有睡得这么好了！仅仅是有他在身边，就足以让我好好睡上一觉，真是难得。我感觉温暖……他的心跳声真的很抚慰人心……等等！心跳声？’  
  
  
  
She opened her eyes and saw that indeed, she was in his arms, her head on his chest, and that it felt _very_ good. But he couldn't see this, nor know how it made her feel. He stirred a little when she extracted herself from his arms. She put a hand on his cheek and whispered "Thank you, Shinji." before waking him up too.  
她睁开眼睛，发现自己确实在他怀里，头靠在他的胸膛上，感觉非常舒适。但他看不见这一幕，也不知道这让她感觉如何。当她从他的臂弯中抽身时，他微微动了动。她把手放在他的脸颊上，低声说：“谢谢你，真嗣。”然后也唤醒了他。  
  

1.   
      
    

"Hey idiot ! My breakfast isn't going to make itself ! I know you'd looove to stay in bed with the most beautiful girl in Tokyo-3 for the rest of your life but we have school today !" She shouted, startling him, but he felt relieved when he understood what she said, and that she wasn't screaming at him for the position they were in when he woke up.  
“嘿，傻瓜！我的早餐可不会自己做好！我知道你一定很愿意和东京-3 最漂亮的女孩在床上度过余生，但我们今天还得上学呢！”她大声喊道，吓了他一跳，但当他明白她的话时，感到一阵释然，因为她并没有因为他醒来时的姿势而对他大喊大叫。  
  
  
  
He left her room and went straight to his to put on his school uniform before heading to the kitchen to fix breakfast for himself and his roommates, he had to force himself to suppress the smile on his face, because he didn't want to have an embarrassing talk with Misato when she would wake up. It hadn't been too difficult, because he knew things would not come that easy. Not with Asuka... And not with himself... As much as he wanted to be with her, he knew that the most likely outcome was that he was going to mess everything up, so he decided to see how she would act first, which was a way of not admitting that he wasn't going to do anything.  
他离开她的房间，径直回到自己的房间换上校服，然后前往厨房为他和室友们准备早餐。他不得不强迫自己压抑住脸上的笑容，因为他不想在 Misato 醒来时与她进行尴尬的对话。这并不太难，因为他知道事情不会那么容易。无论是与 Asuka，还是与他自己...尽管他渴望与她在一起，但他清楚最有可能的结果是他会把一切搞砸，因此他决定先观察她的行为，这是一种不承认自己不会采取任何行动的方式。  
  
  
  
Asuka was already in her school uniform and she locked herself in the bathroom for her morning routine. And for her part, she was back to her usual self. She was angry. Angry at him for everything that happened, but most of all, angry at herself for liking it as much as she did. 'Why did it have to be that good ? Dammit ! I should hate him ! I've always hated him !' She knew that last part was a lie, but today, she didn't want to think about the times when she genuinely was glad he was part of her life. Ready for the day, she stepped out of the bathroom deciding that she would be nice to him today and just ignore him, instead of what her instincts told her to do, which was to lash out at him.  
明日香已经换上了校服，她把自己锁在浴室里进行早上的日常。至于她自己，她又回到了平时的状态。她很生气。对他所发生的一切感到愤怒，但最主要的，是对自己如此喜欢这件事感到愤怒。'为什么它必须那么好？该死！我应该恨他！我一直都恨他！'她知道最后那部分是谎言，但今天，她不想去想那些她真心庆幸他存在于她生活中的时刻。准备好迎接新的一天，她走出浴室，决定今天对他好一点，只是无视他，而不是听从本能去攻击他。  
  
  
  
Hence, the walk to school was quiet and uneasy. Shinji was looking at his feet, trying his best to hide his sadness, not daring to take a first step towards Asuka, feeling her anger. He knew how to read the signs by now, and he was certain that she was about to burst. They arrived in their class just seconds before it started and went to their respective desks without exchanging even a look.  
因此，去学校的路上安静而紧张。真嗣低头看着自己的脚，尽力隐藏自己的悲伤，不敢向明日香迈出第一步，感受着她的愤怒。他现在懂得如何解读这些迹象了，他确信她即将爆发。他们在上课前几秒钟到达教室，各自走向自己的座位，连一眼都没有交换。  
  
  
  
The bell announcing lunch break startled Shinji, who couldn't make any sense of why Asuka was acting like she was. He spent the whole class thinking about it, looking as discreetly as possible in her direction. 'If she hated everything that much, why did she want me to stay with her last night ? Or why did she not say anything about how they must have woke up ? I really don't understand anything about w...'  
午餐铃声突然响起，吓了真嗣一跳，他完全不明白为什么明日香会那样表现。整个课间他都在思考这个问题，尽可能隐蔽地朝她的方向看去。'如果她那么讨厌一切，为什么昨晚要我陪着她？或者为什么她没有提到他们肯定醒来的事？我对……真的什么都不懂。'  
  
  
  
"Hey Shinji ! Why the long face ?" Kensuke said while taking a chair and sitting in front of him.  
“嘿，真嗣！怎么愁眉苦脸的？” 健介说着搬了把椅子坐在他对面。  
  
  
  
"Yeah Shin-Man ! You look even gloomier than usual, did something happen with the Red Demon again ?" Toji added, sitting on one of the table, his feet on an other.  
“是啊，真哥！你看起来比平时还要阴沉，是不是又和红魔女发生了什么事？” 托吉补充道，坐在一张桌子上，脚搭在另一张上。  
  
  
  
"Yeah..." Shinji answered with a low voice. " You could say that." He looked in the direction of her desk again, only to see that it was empty. 'She must have left to eat with Hikari' he thought.  
“嗯……” 真嗣低声回答，“可以这么说。” 他再次望向她的桌子，却发现那里空无一人。‘她一定是和光去吃饭了’ 他心想。  
  
  
  
"Tell us what happened !" Kensuke demanded rather loudly, before Shinji could go back to his thoughts.  
“告诉我们发生了什么！” 剑介大声追问，打断了真嗣的思绪。  
  
  
  
"Screw that ! You can't let her boss you around like that Shin-Man ! It's time to man up ! Just go to her and tell the Red Demon what you think of her !"  
“去他的！你不能让她这样使唤你，真哥们！是时候振作起来了！直接去找她，告诉红魔你的真实想法！”  
  
  
  
"Yeah, like you did with her ? You want me to tell you how it ended when you did that ?" Kensuke smirked.  
“是啊，就像你对她的那样？你想让我告诉你那次的结果吗？” 真嗣冷笑道。  
  
  
  
"It's not the same ! I'm not living with her !" Toji retorted. "Shinji can't let her do that, otherwise she'll make his life a living hell ! She already does !"  
“这不一样！我没和她住在一起！” 东治反驳道，“真嗣不能让她这么做，否则她会把他的生活搞得一团糟！她已经在这么做了！”  
  
  
  
Shinji didn't answer, but Toji's words rang in his mind. He knew that he was right. That he had to face her to clarify everything. 'If I don't do anything, things will go back to how they were before. Maybe even worse. I have to talk to her after school.'  
真嗣没有回答，但东治的话在他脑海中回响。他知道东治是对的。他必须面对她来澄清一切。‘如果我什么都不做，事情会回到从前那样。甚至可能更糟。我得在放学后和她谈谈。’  
  
  
  
Toji and Kensuke were arguing about which strategy would be better against Asuka, and pretty much ignored Shinji as their conversation became more heated. He was glad for that, because he wasn't in the mood to talk. His mind went back to their kiss. 'If only they knew', he thought.  
真治和健介正在争论哪种策略对付明日香更有效，随着对话越来越激烈，他们几乎忽略了真嗣。他对此感到庆幸，因为他没心情说话。他的思绪回到了他们的吻。'如果他们知道就好了'，他想。  
  
  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
Asuka left class as fast as she could after taking her lunch from Shinji. She didn't want to see anyone. She didn't want to talk to anyone. She needed time to think. 'I don't get it ! I can't let him be near me ! I don't need anyone ! Especially not him ! But... I don't want him to leave. And I know he will ! He always runs away ! And if I accept him, he will as soon as he'll know how pathetic I am... He'll leave, just like everyone else left... But maybe... Aaaaaaaargh !  
明日香从真嗣那里拿了午餐后，尽可能快地离开了教室。她不想见任何人。她不想和任何人说话。她需要时间思考。'我不明白！我不能让他靠近我！我不需要任何人！尤其是他！但是...我不想让他离开。我知道他会！他总是逃跑！如果我接受他，他一旦知道我有多可悲...他就会离开，就像其他人一样离开...但也许...啊啊啊啊啊！  
  
  
  
Her thoughts were interrupted by a pigtailed brunette.  
她的思绪被一个扎着马尾的棕发女孩打断了。  
  
  
  
"Asuka, you left in a hurry. Are you okay ?" asked Hikari, genuinely concerned about her best friend.  
"明日香，你走得那么急，没事吧？" 光子关切地问她的好友。  
  
  
  
"Shinji pisses me off." She grunted, knowing that Hikari wasn't asking this question out of pity for her.  
"真嗣那家伙真让我火大。" 她咕哝着，知道光子并非出于同情才问这个问题。  
  
  
  
"What did he do this time ?", Hikari responded, her tone betraying her disapproval of Asuka's behavior towards her fellow pilot.  
"这次他又做了什么？" 光子回应道，语气中透露出对明日香对待同僚飞行员态度的不满。  
  
  
  
Asuka had troubles not exploding when she heard that question "What's that supposed to mean ?"  
听到那个问题“那是什么意思？”，明日香差点没炸毛。  
  
  
  
Taken aback, but not willing to let go, Hikari pressed "Well uhm... It seems that Ikari has a way of getting under your skin." She stated, amused at her own comment, but she didn't show it. She could see they both had a crush on each other, so she sometimes said comments like that, just so maybe Asuka would get the hint.  
虽然有些惊讶，但不愿就此罢休，光子继续追问：“嗯...看来碇君总有办法惹你生气。”她带着一丝戏谑地说道，但并未表露出来。她看得出他们俩互相喜欢，所以有时会说些这样的话，希望明日香能有所察觉。  
  
  
  
"It doesn't matter. You know how he is ! Just being close to this wimp is enough to piss me off. Some times he's just more infuriating than others."  
“无所谓了。你知道他那德行！光是靠近这个窝囊废就够让我火大的了。有时候他就是比平时更让人恼火。”  
  
  
  
"I think you're too hard on him. He's doing what he can to reach out to you." She knew when the first word escaped her mouth that she would summon her friend's anger, and since she was already angry, it wouldn't be long before she would storm out. Asuka always did that when she was too angry at her, because she didn't want to shout at her best friend... But this time she stayed, so Hikari was starting to believe that she pushed too far this time. She braced herself for the oncoming storm... Which never came.  
“我觉得你对他的要求太苛刻了。他已经在尽力向你示好了。”她知道，当第一个字从她嘴里蹦出来时，就会激起朋友的怒火，而既然她已经生气了，那么她很快就会冲出去。明日香总是这样，当她对她太生气时，因为她不想对最好的朋友大喊大叫……但这次她留了下来，所以光开始相信这次她可能做得太过分了。她做好了迎接即将到来的风暴的准备……但风暴从未到来。  
  
  
  
"Maybe you're right." Was all that Asuka answered. She didn't sound angry, just... Confused. Lost in her thoughts. So the both of them ate in silence. Before returning to class.  
“也许你是对的。”明日香只是这样回答。她的声音并不愤怒，只是……困惑。迷失在自己的思绪中。于是她们俩默默地吃完了饭。然后回到教室。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
They went home the same way they went to school. In silence, but it was different. They were both too absorbed in their minds to talk to each other this time.  
她们放学回家的路和上学时一样，沉默着，但这次不同。她们都沉浸在自己的思绪中，这次没有互相交谈。  
  
  
  
Asuka kept her head straight, her shoulders squared. Confidence radiated from her, as always, except if one was to look directly into her eyes. They were... Blank. Her brows frowned. They betrayed her uncertainty, there seemed to be a war raging inside her mind. She was glad, as a consequence, that Shinji was walking a few steps before her.  
明日香保持着头部直立，肩膀挺直。一如既往地，自信从她身上散发出来，除非有人直视她的眼睛。那双眼眸...空洞无物。她的眉头紧皱，透露出她的不确定，仿佛内心正掀起一场激烈的战争。因此，她很庆幸真嗣走在她前面几步。  
  
  
  
He looked disturbingly similar to her. It was rather uncommon for him. His fists were clenched, his eyes showed a confidence that usually could only be seen when he was sitting inside his Entry Plug.  
他看起来与她惊人地相似。这对他来说相当罕见。他的拳头紧握，眼中流露出通常只有在驾驶插入栓内才能看到的自信。  
  
  
  
They hadn't lived in this city for a long time, especially not Asuka, but they could have walked back to the apartment they shared with their commanding officer/guardian with their eyes closed. It was a good thing, since neither of them seemed to be paying attention to their surroundings.  
他们在这个城市生活的时间并不长，尤其是明日香，但他们闭着眼睛都能走回与指挥官/监护人共享的公寓。这倒是件好事，因为他们似乎都没在注意周围的环境。  
  
  
  
When they finally reached their home, Asuka mechanically took off her shoes and went straight to her room. Shinji wanted to confront her then but couldn't reach her in time. As much as he wanted to, he was still scared of her, as he had been this morning. But he wouldn't run away. He was just postponing their unavoidable (so he had decided) conversation.  
当他们终于回到家时，明日香机械地脱下鞋子，径直走向自己的房间。真嗣本想立刻找她对峙，却没能及时追上。尽管他很想这么做，但仍像今早一样害怕她。不过，他不会逃跑。他只是在推迟那场不可避免（他已决定）的对话。  
  
  
  
Dinner came and went. Even Misato stayed quiet. She could feel her charges' tension. And this time it felt different than usual to her. So she decided against teasing them as she would have usually done to try and cheer them up. Even her attempts at making conversation fell flat, so she instead focused on her beers.  
晚餐来了又去。就连美里也保持沉默。她能感受到孩子们之间的紧张气氛。这次给她的感觉与往常不同。因此，她决定不像平时那样逗弄他们以试图让他们振作起来。就连她试图展开的对话也显得无力，于是她转而专注于喝啤酒。  
  
  
  
Asuka went to her room without even uttering a word.  
明日香一言不发地回到自己的房间。  
  
  
  
"I'm going to bed too", Misato said some minutes after. "It'll be good to catch up on some sleep ! Good night Shin-Chan !"  
"我也去睡觉了", 美里几分钟后说道。"能补个觉真是太好了！晚安，真嗣君！"  
  
  
  
"Good night, Misato-San !" Shinji answered, still doing the dishes.  
"晚安，美里小姐！" 真嗣回答，仍在洗碗。  
  
  
  
He took a few deep breaths after having finished and knocked gently on Asuka's door frame.  
他做完后深呼吸了几下，轻轻敲了敲明日香的门框。  
  
  
  
"Leave me alone." Was all the answer he got.  
“别管我。”这是他得到的全部回答。  
  
  
  
He flinched, but opened the door nonetheless and went inside.  
他畏缩了一下，但还是打开了门，走了进去。  
  
  
  
"No." He answered calmly 'I mustn't run away.', closing the door quietly behind him.  
“不。”他平静地回答，‘我不能逃跑。’轻轻地关上了身后的门。  
  
  
  
"Is it going to become a habit ? You coming in my room when I clearly tell you not to ?" She was annoyed. She had had a lot of time to think today, but she couldn't organize her thoughts. Every time she thought about Shinji long enough, her mind brought back the memories of their kiss, of their hug, of his heartbeat against her ear, and everything it made her feel. So she couldn't concentrate, and as a consequence, she hadn't made any progress towards making a decision.  
“这会成为习惯吗？我明明告诉你不要进来，你却还是闯进我的房间？”她感到恼火。今天她有很多时间思考，但无法整理自己的思绪。每当她想到真嗣足够久，她的脑海就会回放他们的吻、他们的拥抱、他的心跳在她耳边的感觉，以及这一切带给她的感受。因此她无法集中注意力，结果是，她没有在做出决定方面取得任何进展。  
  
  
  
"W-We need to talk." he stammered, trying his best to sound confident.  
“我、我们需要谈谈。”他结结巴巴地说，尽力让自己听起来自信。  
  
  
  
This was the last straw for her. She didn't want to have this conversation yet, so her anger finally won.  
这对她来说是最后一根稻草。她还不准备进行这场对话，所以她的愤怒终于占了上风。  
  
  
  
"Listen, Third Child." she didn't want to raise her voice in order not to stir Misato's attention, but Shinji could clearly ear her anger. "We're not the same. I can't just bare my heart like that in front of you. I just needed time to think, but no ! Shinji Ikari just had to selfishly come and _demand_ that we talked ! So let me grant your wish, Third Child. You piss me off ! And you can't possibly believe that I would fall into your arms because you decided to barge into my room yet again. You cannot be _that_ stupid !" Her voice had raised, so she took a few calming breaths before muttering "I don't want to need you..."  
"“听着，三号机驾驶员。”她不想提高声音以免引起美里小姐的注意，但真嗣能清楚地听到她的愤怒。“我们不一样。我不能就这样在你面前敞开心扉。我只是需要时间思考，但不行！碇真嗣就是得自私地跑来要求我们谈谈！那就如你所愿，三号机驾驶员。你让我生气了！你不可能真的以为我会因为你再次闯进我的房间就投入你的怀抱。你不可能那么愚蠢！”她的声音提高了，于是她深呼吸几次平复情绪，低声说道：“我不想需要你……””  
  
  
  
Shinji dropped his head and whispered "I'm sorry" before leaving and going to his room.  
真嗣低下头，轻声说了句“对不起”，然后离开回到自己的房间。  
  
  
  
She regretted her outburst as soon as she started talking. 'Way to go Asuka ! Didn't you mean it when you agreed to be nicer to him earlier ?.. I know he won't take another first step now... I told him that perseverance is power, but I know he will stop eventually. Because of me. Because I keep pushing him away. Because I can't let him close to me. He was already scared of me, now it must be even worse. I have to make him understand that I _do_ nee... That I don't hate him... That I wouldn't mind if he came back to my room tonight...'  
她一开口就后悔自己的爆发了。'干得好啊，明日香！你之前答应过要对他好一点的，难道不是真心的吗？……我知道他不会再主动迈出一步了……我告诉他坚持就是力量，但我知道他最终会放弃的。因为我。因为我一直在推开他。因为我无法让他靠近我。他本来就已经害怕我了，现在肯定更糟了。我得让他明白我真的需要……我不讨厌他……如果他今晚回到我房间，我不会介意的……'  
  
  
  
With that, she took a pen and a piece of paper and hastily wrote something, as if it would lessen what she was doing in her mind. She didn't dare to face him, which was very unlike her, she thought, so it seemed like the best thing to do. She then quietly went to Shinji's door and tried to slip the note under. She then started to cursing in German at how unpractical Japanese doors were in this particular situation. She eventually opened his door very slightly, just enough to slip the note through, before quickly going back to her room and closing her door. She sat on her bed, looking at it expectantly, almost pleadingly.  
想到这里，她拿起笔和纸匆匆写下些什么，仿佛这样能减轻她心中的负担。她不敢面对他，这在她看来非常不像自己，所以这似乎是最好的办法。她悄悄走到真嗣的门前，试图把纸条塞进去。她开始用德语咒骂在这种特定情况下日本门的不实用。最终，她轻轻推开他的门，刚好够把纸条塞进去，然后迅速回到自己的房间关上门。她坐在床上，满怀期待地望着门口，几乎是在恳求。  
  
  
  
Shinji's attention had been drawn by the noises he heard at his door, and he was about to open it when he saw a note falling at his feet. Picking it up, he unfolded it and read its contents. On the paper were shaky and hesitant kanjis.  
真嗣的注意力被门口的嘈杂声吸引，正要开门时，一张纸条落在了他的脚边。他捡起来，展开阅读。纸上的汉字颤抖而犹豫。  
  
  
  
"Be patient with me please"  
"请对我耐心些"  
  
  
  
He folded the note, and put it on his desk. Then he went back to Asuka's room.  
他将纸条折好，放在桌上。然后回到了明日香的房间。

### Chapter 3 : Watch her disappear

Nothing much had changed in the Katsuragi Residence in the two days which had passed since Asuka and Shinji's altercation. The former still berated the latter on a more or less hourly basis, and kept voicing her discontent between those times. Shinji was still the housebroken teenager he had always been, and their guardian was still punishing her liver, one beer at a time. The only thing noticeable was that the Children seemed to be in a better mood. It was barely perceptible, but it was there. Shinji didn't cower as much as he used to when Asuka shouted at him, and she was less insulting, having switched to more general than personal attacks.  
自那次明日香和真嗣的争执以来，已经过去了两天，葛城宅并没有太大变化。前者依旧每隔一小时左右就对后者进行训斥，并在其间不断表达不满。真嗣依然是那个顺从的少年，而他们的监护人则依旧在用啤酒一点一点地折磨自己的肝脏。唯一值得注意的是，孩子们的心情似乎有所好转。虽然变化微乎其微，但确实存在。真嗣在明日香吼他时不再像以前那样畏缩，而她也不再那么刻薄，转而使用更为普遍而非针对个人的攻击。  
  
  
  
Shinji had always felt concerned by Misato's drinking habit. He cared a lot about her, of course. She was the first person in a very long time who showed genuine affection for him. And he felt conflicted, because for now, he was glad that she was always at least tipsy when she was home, for if she wasn't, she might have seen how he and Asuka looked at each other sometimes, how he had furiously blushed at the time when she stormed inside the living room with just a towel to cover her, and how she blushed as well when she saw that. Her bath _was_ indeed too hot, but it wasn't only because of that that she came into the living room. She had, maybe only unconsciously, wanted him to see her like this. She could have just shouted from the bathroom.  
真嗣一直对美里酗酒的习惯感到担忧。他当然很关心她，毕竟她是许久以来第一个对他展现真挚情感的人。他内心矛盾，因为眼下他庆幸她回家时总有些微醺，否则她可能会察觉到他和明日香之间某些时刻的眼神交流，以及当他看到她只裹着一条毛巾怒气冲冲地走进客厅时，他那难以掩饰的涨红脸庞，还有她看到这一幕后同样泛起的红晕。她的浴室确实太热了，但这并非她走进客厅的唯一原因。或许是无意识地，她想让他看到自己这副模样。她本可以从浴室里大喊一声的。  
  
  
  
When Shinji came back to Asuka's room two days ago, he had been surprised to see her give him one of her all too few in his opinion genuine smile with gleaming eyes. And when he had laid down beside her, he had been utterly astonished when she laid her head on his chest and put her hand on the side of his neck gently, her arm resting on his chest as well. After some hesitation, he had hugged her back and they had talked. They decided two things together there and then. First, that _this_ would be their new sleeping arrangement for the foreseeable future. Asuka had made a point not to leave him with any choice, but Shinji, In a bolder mood than usual, had acquiesced firmly, to her great delight. Second, that they would not talk about it to anyone. Being Eva pilots meant that nothing in their life was secret. That even their most private thoughts, pains, traumas or few joys were known by others, not leaving them any choice in the matter. But this was different, this was one thing _they_ shared. That belonged only to them. That nobody had to know, or more precisely, that nobody known. At least for now. So they promised each other that they would not tell anyone nor show anyone that they were... Together ? They had not talked about that. They slept in the same bed, in each other's arms. That was enough. The added benefit to Asuka was that she _had_ to keep on chastising him for every little things he did that annoyed her.  
两天前，当真嗣回到明日香的房间时，他惊讶地看到她眼中闪烁着光芒，给了他一个在他看来极为难得的真诚微笑。当他躺到她身边时，她将头靠在他的胸口，温柔地把手放在他的脖颈旁，手臂也搭在他的胸前，这让他完全惊呆了。犹豫片刻后，他回抱了她，两人开始交谈。就在那时，他们共同决定了两件事。首先，这是他们未来一段时间内新的睡眠安排。明日香坚决不给他留下任何选择余地，但真嗣比平时更为大胆，坚定地同意了，这让明日香非常高兴。其次，他们不会向任何人提及此事。作为 EVA 驾驶员，意味着他们生活中没有任何秘密。即使是他们最私人的想法、痛苦、创伤或少数的快乐，也都被他人所知，他们对此别无选择。但这是不同的，这是他们共享的一件事，只属于他们自己。不需要让任何人知道，或者更确切地说，没有人知道。至少目前如此。 于是他们互相承诺，不会向任何人透露，也不会向任何人展示他们是...在一起的？他们并没有明确讨论过这一点。他们同床共枕，相拥而眠。这就足够了。对明日香来说，额外的好处是她不得不一直责备他，因为他做的每一件小事都让她感到恼火。

Misato was standing in the Pribnow Box, her arms crossed. She was looking out the window idly at the Test Plugs, not focusing on anything, not paying attention to the voice in the PA system.  
美里站在普里伯诺盒中，双臂交叉。她漫不经心地望着窗外的测试插头，没有专注于任何事物，也没有留意广播系统中的声音。  
  
  
  
_B-type harmonics test, all green. Projected adjustment values have been cleared.  
B 型谐波测试，全部绿灯。预计调整值已清除。_  
  
  
  
She was snapped back to this world by a voice directly addressing her.  
一个直接向她说话的声音将她拉回了现实世界。  
  
  
  
"You look tired, Misato." Makoto Hyuga stated with as little concern as he allowed himself to express while inquiring about his commanding officer's state. Everyone in the room knew that he was attracted to her, and he was well aware of that, but he didn't want to display it openly regardless of that fact.  
“你看起来很疲惫，美里。”真琴真人尽量不带太多关切地说道，他在询问上司的状态时尽量克制自己的情感。房间里的每个人都知道他对她有好感，他自己也很清楚，但他不想公开表露这一点。  
  
  
  
"Yeah, for a lot of private reasons." Misato answered with a reassuring smile, glad for his interest in her well-being. She had taken advantage of his feelings for her personal gain in the last few months, but she had decided to stop giving him false hopes some weeks back. She had been even more comforted in her decision by what happened between her and Kaji when they left the wedding they attended with Ritsuko.  
“嗯，有很多私人原因。”美里带着安慰的微笑回答，很高兴他对她的关心。过去几个月里，她利用了他对她的感情来为自己谋利，但几周前她决定不再给他虚假的希望。自从她和加持在他们参加的婚礼上与律子离开后发生的事情，她更加坚定了这个决定。  
  
  
  
"Kaji ?" Ritsuko couldn't pass the opportunity to tease her oldest friend.  
“加持？”律子忍不住调侃她最老的朋友。  
  
  
  
"Shut up !" Misato snapped back vehemently, not wishing to dwell on the issue in the middle of a sync test. "Well, how's the Third Child doing ?" she asked, turning back to the window and restoring her neutral expression as if her sudden outburst never occurred.  
"“闭嘴！” 美里激烈地回击，不想在同步测试中途深究这个问题。“那么，第三适格者怎么样了？”她转回窗户，恢复了中立的表情，仿佛刚才的突然爆发从未发生过。”  
  
  
  
"Take a look." Maya Ibuki answered with a slight smile.  
"“看看吧。” 伊吹玛雅微微一笑回答道。”  
  
  
  
"Let me see... That's great, both Asuka and Shinji have increased their sync ratio. And Shinji has the highest score ! I hope that knowing this will boost his confidence." Opening a direct communication to Test Plug 01, she added "Can you hear me, Shinji ?  
"“让我看看...太好了，明日香和真嗣的同步率都提高了。而且真嗣的分数最高！希望知道这一点能增强他的信心。”她打开与测试插入栓 01 的直接通讯，补充道：“你能听到我说话吗，真嗣？”  
  
  
  
Shinji blinked after opening his eyes as Misato's question broke his concentration.  
真嗣睁开眼睛后眨了眨眼，美里的问题打断了他的思绪。  
  
  
  
"Misato, how were my test scores ?" He asked expectantly. He was in a great mood, he had been since he had shared his story with Asuka.  
“美里，我的考试成绩怎么样？”他满怀期待地问道。自从他和明日香分享了自己的故事后，他的心情一直很好。  
  
  
  
"Yes ! You are number one !" Misato answered, filling him even more with joy. But it didn't last long, as he knew it meant that he beat her. He knew that she wouldn't be happy. He knew how important being the best was for her. His first place left as a consequence a bittersweet taste in his mouth, much more bitter than sweet.  
“太好了！你是第一名！”美里回答道，这让他的喜悦更加充盈。但这并没有持续多久，因为他知道这意味着他击败了她。他知道她对成为最好的有多么重视。他的第一名结果在他嘴里留下了一种苦乐参半的味道，苦涩远多于甜美。  
  
  
  
When the test ended, he went back to the apartment by himself. He left as quickly as possible so he wouldn't have to face Asuka. 'She must hate me right now. She probably doesn't want me anywhere near her.' "I'm sorry." He muttered to himself, a hollow smile on his face with these words. He knew that it would be even worse if he was to apologize to her face to face. So he sat there, at the back of the bus, completely oblivious to the outside world.  
考试结束后，他独自回到了公寓。他尽可能快地离开，以免面对明日香。'她现在一定恨死我了。她大概不想让我靠近她。' “对不起。”他喃喃自语，脸上带着空洞的微笑。他知道如果当面向她道歉，情况会更糟。于是他坐在公交车的后排，完全无视外界。

In the female pilots locker room, Asuka fumed.  
在女飞行员更衣室里，明日香怒火中烧。  
  
  
  
"I lost ! He beat us so easily. He beat us so easily that it's pissing me off !" She was shouting and making grand gestures to vent out her anger while Rei was quietly putting on her school uniform.  
“我输了！他轻松地打败了我们。他如此轻易地打败了我们，真是让我火大！”她大声喊叫，夸张地挥舞着手臂发泄怒气，而绫波则在安静地穿上校服。  
  
  
  
"He's great, wonderful, awesome, too awesome ! The Invincible Shinji ! So that makes our job a little easier, right ?" She didn't even hear Rei closing her locker behind her as she continued shouting. "But it also means we'll have to do our best to not be left behind !"  
“他太棒了，太出色了，简直太出色了！无敌的真嗣！这样一来我们的任务就轻松一些了，对吧？”她甚至没注意到绫波在她身后关上了储物柜，继续大声说道，“但这同时也意味着我们必须全力以赴，不能被甩在后面！”  
  
  
  
"Goodbye." Rei said on the threshold, as expressionless as ever. But as soon as the door closed, Asuka stopped talking. She sat on the bench behind her. Part of her outburst had been in order to keep her persona in front of the others, but she was truly angry at Shinji. Very angry in fact. So she sat on the bench and started thinking. She was confused, and she hated that.  
“再见。”绫波在门口说道，一如既往地面无表情。但门一关上，明日香就停止了说话。她坐在身后的长椅上。刚才那一番爆发部分是为了在其他人面前维持自己的形象，但她确实对真嗣感到非常愤怒。事实上，她非常生气。于是她坐在长椅上，开始思考。她感到困惑，而这让她很讨厌。

There hadn't been an Angel attack in a long time, so Misato had had time to catch up on her paperwork. It was a very good thing because she wanted to be there for her charges. She knew that the mood wouldn't be pleasant, but she wanted Shinji to know that she would protect him from their roommate's wrath, and she wanted Asuka to know that she was there if she wanted to talk, to sit in silence or anything that she would have wanted to do.  
已经很久没有使徒袭击了，所以美里有时间赶上了她的文书工作。这是一件非常好的事情，因为她想陪伴在她负责的孩子们身边。她知道气氛不会愉快，但她希望真嗣知道她会保护他免受室友的怒火，也希望明日香知道，如果她想聊天、静静地坐着或做任何她想做的事情，她都在那里。  
  
  
  
As she predicted, dinner had been tense. Asuka kept silent the whole time, frowning as in deep thoughts, or contained raged, she couldn't be sure, but the latter seemed more likely to her. Shinji had tried to keep silent, but couldn't force himself to ignore Misato so he answered her questions and conversations attempts with as few words as he could. When he went to the bathroom, Misato decided it was the right moment.  
正如她所预料的，晚餐气氛紧张。明日香全程沉默不语，眉头紧锁，似乎陷入了沉思，或是压抑着愤怒，她无法确定，但后者似乎更有可能。真嗣试图保持沉默，但无法强迫自己忽视美里，于是他用尽可能少的字句回答她的问题和交谈尝试。当他去洗手间时，美里觉得时机到了。  
  
  
  
"You know, it was just a sync test. Don't you go and..."  
"你知道，那只是一个同步测试。你不必……"  
  
  
  
"Save it !" Asuka interrupted her, not as harshly as Misato was expecting. 'Did it hit her that bad ?' Misato asked herself. "... But I appreciate it." Asuka added, smiling slightly, but genuinely, at her guardian. She knew that Misato cared for her. And the fact that she always seemed to favor Shinji in her eyes didn't change that fact. There were too few that actually cared. She always boasted that she didn't need anyone, but she was glad when someone she deemed worthy actually showed care. "I'm going to bed. Good night." With that, she stood and went to her bedroom.  
"省省吧！" 明日香打断了她，语气并没有美里预想的那么严厉。'这打击对她有那么大吗？'美里自问。"... 但我很感激。" 明日香补充道，微微一笑，真诚地向她的监护人表示感谢。她知道美里关心她。尽管美里似乎总是偏袒真嗣，但这并没有改变这一事实。真正关心她的人太少了。她总是夸口说自己不需要任何人，但当她认为值得的人表现出关心时，她感到欣慰。"我去睡觉了。晚安。" 说完，她起身走向自己的卧室。  
  
  
  
When Shinji came back a few seconds later, he found Misato standing next to the kitchen table.  
当真嗣几秒钟后回来时，他发现美里站在厨房桌旁。  
  
  
  
"Don't bother with the dishes, I'll do them tomorrow. You should get some sleep. And don't beat yourself up too hard over Asuka. She'll come around, you know her."  
“别管那些盘子了，我明天再洗。你应该去睡一会儿。别太自责了，明日香她会想通的，你了解她的。”  
  
  
  
'That's because I know her that I'm beating myself up.' "M-maybe."  
“正因为我知道她，我才在自责。”“可——可能吧。”  
  
  
  
"You'll see ! You should tell her honestly how you feel about that. It just might cheer her up. I'm going to bed, good night, Shin-Chan !"  
“你会看到的！你应该诚实地告诉她你对那件事的感受。这或许能让她振作起来。我要去睡觉了，晚安，真嗣！”  
  
  
  
"Good night." Shinji followed Misato to the living room, switching the lights off on the way, then went to his room. After closing his door, he sighed. He had decided not to go to Asuka's room this night. 'I'll leave her alone tonight, she's upset because of me, going to her room will only...' His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his door sliding open.  
“晚安。”真嗣跟着美里来到客厅，沿途关掉了灯，然后回到自己的房间。关上门后，他叹了口气。他决定今晚不去明日香的房间。‘今晚我让她一个人待着吧，她因为我而心烦，去她房间只会……’他的思绪被门滑开的声音打断了。  
  
  
  
"What are you doing here ? Come." Asuka demanded in a whisper so as not to attract attention from their other roommate. Shinji followed her and laid on her bed next to her when she ordered him to. She nestled herself against him, as she had been doing for the last nights. It was convenient for her because he couldn't see her face.  
“你在这里做什么？过来。”明日香低声命令道，以免引起另一位室友的注意。真嗣跟着她，按照她的指示躺在她的床上。她依偎在他身边，就像过去几晚一样。这对她很方便，因为他看不见她的脸。  
  
  
  
"I was selected to become a pilot when I was four. I was so happy, so proud, but it didn't last long..." She started talking and immediately paused. She had decided she would talk to him, that she would try to make him understand, but it was harder than she imagined.  
“我在四岁时被选中成为一名飞行员。我非常高兴，非常自豪，但那幸福并没有持续多久……”她开始讲述，随即停顿了一下。她决定要和他谈谈，试图让他理解，但这比她想象的要难得多。  
  
  
  
"Why ?" He asked after a few seconds of silence. He felt her tense, her arm tightening around him.  
“为什么？”他沉默了几秒后问道。他感觉到她紧张起来，手臂紧紧地环绕着他。  
  
  
  
"Don't ask. What's important is that I devoted myself to being the best. I was selected to be an elite Eva Pilot. The Second Child. My mission was to save to world ! I promised myself I'd be the best, a hero to be praised !.." She paused for a second, Shinji, understanding that it was difficult for her, gently rubbed her back. If it was for his gesture or not, he didn't know, but she continued. "That's why I resented you when we first met. It took me years of training to reach the sync rate you had when you first sortied..." Her words were harsh in Shinji's ears, but her tone wasn't. 'She's just stating the facts.' he thought, not daring to interrupt her. "And I'm mad at you for having beaten me today... But not as much as I should be, I think. Because I know you don't do it intentionally. I know you don't like piloting. You really are an idiot !" Her tone carried more emotions now. But she wasn't insulting him like she used to. "You know, if I'm telling you all this right now, it's because of you.  
"“别问了。重要的是我全心全意地追求卓越。我被选为精英 Eva 驾驶员，是第二适任者。我的使命是拯救世界！我曾发誓要成为最棒的，一个值得赞颂的英雄！”她顿了一下，真嗣明白这对她来说很艰难，便轻轻地抚摸她的背。不知是因为他的举动还是其他原因，她继续说道：“这就是为什么我们初次见面时我对你心怀怨恨。我花了数年训练才达到的同步率，你第一次出击时就拥有了……”她的话在真嗣听来很刺耳，但语气并不严厉。‘她只是在陈述事实。’他心想，不敢打断她。“今天我对你生气，因为你打败了我……但似乎没有我应该有的那么生气。因为我知道你不是故意的。我知道你不喜欢驾驶 Eva。你真是个笨蛋！”她的语气现在带上了更多情感。但她不再像以前那样辱骂他。“你知道，我现在把这些告诉你，都是因为你。”  
  
  
  
"What do you mean ?"  
“你是什么意思？”  
  
  
  
"When you told me about..." She stopped herself, not wanting to bring back the subject of his mother so bluntly. "When we talked... Good things happened... So I figured that maybe I could talk to you. That's what you wanted, right ?" She added that last part in an angrier tone. Opening up was still difficult, so was letting her guard down. Or less up, to be exact.  
"“当你告诉我关于……”她顿住了，不想如此直白地重提他母亲的话题。“当我们交谈时……好事发生了……所以我想，也许我可以和你聊聊。这是你想要的，对吧？”她最后那句带着更重的怒气。敞开心扉依然困难，放下戒备亦然。或者更确切地说，是没那么紧绷。”  
  
  
  
"Thank you" He answered in a whisper.  
“谢谢你”他低声回答。  
  
  
  
"But still. Having you beat me without even trying... It's as if everything I did was useless..." 'That _I_ am useless'. "If I'm not the best..."  
“但即便如此。你甚至没费力就打败了我……仿佛我做的一切都毫无意义……”‘我毫无用处’。“如果我不是最好的……”  
  
  
  
"B-but you are the best !" Shinji cut her, trying to sound confident. His stuttering didn't convey this idea, though.  
“但、但是你是最棒的！” 真嗣打断她，试图显得自信。然而，他的结巴并没有传达出这个意思。  
  
  
  
"Don't rub it in, Third Child." Asuka was starting to get angry.  
“别得意忘形了，第三适格者。” 明日香开始生气了。  
  
  
  
"I-I'm not ! S-sure, I beat you today in this test" He was starting to get really scared as he saw and felt her tense dangerously. In this position, he wouldn't last a minute against her. In any position, to be exact. "But you're still the best pilot !" he blurted out "Your technique is _much_ better, your knowledge, your confidence, and your style, you move so graciously... In combat" He quickly added, blushing. "Our sync rate doesn't mean anything ! I can't do half of what you can do with your Eva !  
"“我、我没有！确、确实，今天这场测试我赢了你” 他开始感到非常害怕，因为他看到并感受到了她危险的紧张。在这种情况下，他根本撑不过一分钟。准确地说，在任何情况下都是如此。“但你仍然是最好的驾驶员！” 他脱口而出，“你的技术更好，你的知识，你的自信，还有你的风格，你动作如此优雅……在战斗中” 他迅速补充道，脸红了起来。“我们的同步率说明不了什么！我连你用 EVA 能做到的一半都做不到！”  
  
  
  
"Damn right baka !" His little pep talk had worked. She felt a little better, she wasn't useless, and she would show them all ! "And don't you dare think that you won ! I'll beat you back ! And if you want to be first again, you'll have to work for it, Invincible Shinji !"  
“没错，笨蛋！”他的小小鼓励起了作用。她感觉好些了，她并非无用，她会向所有人证明！“你别以为你赢了！我会把你打回去！如果你想再次成为第一，你就得努力争取，无敌的真嗣！”  
  
  
  
"Invincible Shinji ?" He asked, surprised at the epithet.  
“无敌的真嗣？”他问道，对这个称号感到惊讶。  
  
  
  
"I might have found you a new nickname after the sync test. I was a little angry..." She said in a soft tone. She hugged him a little tighter, and he did the same. "Thank you, Shinji."  
“可能在同步测试后我给你找了个新绰号。我当时有点生气……”她轻声说道。她抱得他更紧了，他也同样回应。“谢谢你，真嗣。”  
  
  
  
She shuffled a little against him, finding a better position before letting his heartbeat lull her to sleep.  
她轻轻地在他身边挪动，找到一个更舒适的位置，然后在他的心跳声中渐渐入睡。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
Try as he might, Shinji had a hard time focusing. He had always been scared when going into battle before, but it had never been this much. He was utterly terrified. Before, he didn't have anything to lose. He had always been scared of dying, of course, but it was nothing compared to the idea of losing Asuka. He never thought he could have been even more scared than when he had been thrown into the robot to fight his first battle. 'She's too careless... And I know some day she'll get hurt. She has almost died already ! I can't let that happen !' His hand was clenching and unclenching as it usually done when he was in that kind of situations.  
尽管他尽力尝试，真嗣发现自己很难集中注意力。他以前每次上战场都会害怕，但从未像这次这么严重。他完全被恐惧笼罩。以前，他没有什么可失去的。当然，他一直害怕死亡，但与失去明日香的想法相比，那根本不算什么。他从未想过自己会比第一次被扔进机器人里参加战斗时更害怕。'她太粗心了……我知道有一天她会受伤的。她已经差点死了！我不能让那种事发生！'他的手紧握又松开，就像他在这种情况下通常会做的那样。  
  
  
  
"Can you all here me ? Misato said through the pilots' radios. " I've sent you all of the target's data. This is all we know right now. Approach it carefully and observe its reactions, and, if possible, lure it outside of the city limits. Two of you will back up the other, got that ?" Everyone nodded, as everyone listened intently. "Asuka, you're the most trained in combat, and since you insisted on taking an axe, you'll...  
"“你们能听到我说话吗？”美里通过驾驶员的无线电说道，“我已经把目标的数据发给你们了。这是我们现在所知道的一切。小心接近它，观察它的反应，如果可能的话，把它引到城市边界外。你们两个会支援另一个，明白了吗？”每个人都点了点头，大家都专注地听着。“明日香，你在战斗训练方面最有经验，而且既然你坚持要用斧头，你将……”  
  
  
  
"I'll do it." Shinji cut her through the radio, his face on the Command center monitor showed nothing except for determination. When he was in his entry plug, he was always overtaken by this sense of determination, as if he indeed was invincible. As if the Eva would protect him against everything. He knew Asuka wouldn't like what he was about to say, or the reason why he was going to say it, that is, if he ever got to tell her, but he couldn't let her rush the Angel as she usually did. "I have the highest sync ratio, you said it yourself Misato : "You are number one !""  
“我来吧。”真嗣通过无线电打断了她，指挥中心屏幕上的他脸上只有坚定。每当他进入插入栓时，总会被这种决心所支配，仿佛他真的所向披靡。仿佛 Eva 会为他挡下一切。他知道明日香不会喜欢他即将说的话，或是他说这话的原因，如果他有机会告诉她的话，但他不能让她像往常那样贸然冲向使徒。“我有最高的同步率，你自己说的，美里：‘你是第一！’”  
  
  
  
"Now hold on a second Third Child." Asuka's face appeared on his left in his cockpit, she didn't look happy. "You heard the Major, don't stand in my way." Her eyes were positively blazing.  
“等等，第三适格者。”明日香的脸出现在他驾驶舱的左侧，看起来很不高兴。“你听到了，少碍事。”她的眼神确实在燃烧。  
  
  
  
Shinji couldn't let her take the point back, he had to protect her, even if it meant saying things that would clearly piss her off. Knowing her as he did, he knew perfectly how to trigger some reactions, especially the hostile ones. "I'll show you how it ought to be done, Asuka."  
真嗣不能让她夺回主动权，他必须保护她，即使这意味着要说些明显会惹恼她的话。他很了解她，知道如何引发某些反应，尤其是敌意的那些。“我会让你看看该怎么做，明日香。”  
  
  
  
"What was that ?" Asuka couldn't believe her ears 'After all he said to me yesterday he dares to tell me something like this ? I'm _so_ gonna chew him up once this is over.'  
"“那是什么？” 明日香简直不敢相信自己的耳朵，‘昨天他对我说的那些话，今天居然还敢跟我说这种事？等这事结束了，我非得好好教训他一顿。’”  
  
  
  
"Combat is a man's job after all." He cut his communications right after that last sentence and willed his Evangelion forward. He wasn't proud of this exchange, especially his last sentence, but he pushed those thoughts to the back of his mind for now. When he saw the giant form of the Angel above, he almost lost his determination.  
"“毕竟战斗是男人的工作。” 他说完最后一句话就切断了通讯，操控着他的 EVA 向前推进。他并不为这次对话感到自豪，尤其是最后那句话，但他暂时将这些念头抛诸脑后。当他看到天使巨大的身影时，他的决心几乎动摇了。”  
  
  
  
The Angel didn't look very threatening, and its actions since it appeared reinforced this impression. It looked like a perfect sphere, hovering harmlessly over Tokyo-3, seemingly doing nothing. Its surface was covered with black and white markings with no apparent pattern. At some places the markings were straight, but most of them were curved. Some thicker than the others. It looked like it had been stitched out from various patches that didn't quite go together. Some shapes on its surface looked disturbingly like eyes without pupils. Shinji didn't know if they actually were its eyes. He couldn't make anything of the sphere before him, except for a sense of foreboding... He knew from experience not to mess with an Angel which looked like a geometrical shape. His thoughts were cut short by a voice in his radio.  
使徒看起来并不十分具有威胁性，自其出现以来的行为也加深了这一印象。它形似一个完美的球体，无害地悬浮在第三新东京市上空，似乎无所作为。其表面布满了黑白相间的标记，没有明显的图案。有些地方的标记是直的，但大多数是弯曲的，有些比其他的更粗。它看起来像是用各种不协调的补丁缝合而成的。其表面的一些形状看起来令人不安地像没有瞳孔的眼睛。真嗣不知道它们是否真的是它的眼睛。他无法从眼前的球体中看出任何东西，除了不祥的预感……他从经验中知道，不要招惹一个看似几何形状的使徒。他的思绪被无线电中传来的声音打断。  
  
  
  
"In position." Rei said calmly. She was the furthest away from the Angel, her Eva's back against a building and its left foot on an other in front of her. She was pointing a sniper rifle at the center of the Angel with deadly precision, studying it through her scope.  
“就位。”绫波冷静地说道。她离使徒最远，她的 EVA 背靠一栋建筑，左脚踩在前方的另一栋建筑上。她正用狙击步枪瞄准使徒的中心，通过瞄准镜仔细观察，精准致命。  
  
  
  
"Almost there." Asuka answered. She had fallen behind because she had had to change her umbilical cable, the one she had started with having been to short to zigzag through the city's buildings.  
“快到了。”明日香回答道。她落后了，因为她不得不更换脐带电缆，最初的那根太短，无法在城市建筑间曲折穿行。  
  
  
  
Since they had no strategy, Shinji decided that he would probe the Angel's reactions with some well-aimed bullets. Looking behind him, he saw the shape of Unit 02 coming into his view only to disappear behind another building seconds after. She was going to hide behind another building not too far from his own. 'Of course she had to be close ! Then again she wouldn't have been very effective from far away with her axe.' Shinji thought with some resentment. 'Guess I'll have to draw its attacks then.'  
由于没有策略，真嗣决定用一些精准的子弹来试探使徒的反应。他回头望去，看到 02 号机身影出现在视野中，随即又消失在另一栋建筑后。她打算躲在不远处的另一栋建筑后面。‘她当然得靠近！不过，用斧头从远处攻击效果也不会太好。’真嗣有些怨气地想。‘看来我得吸引它的攻击了。’  
  
  
  
"In position." Asuka whispered, as if the Angel would have heard her. Shinji looked into her eyes on his screen. She looked back at him with an angry frown... Not only because of the Angel. He nodded. She nodded back.  
“就位了。”明日香低声说，仿佛使徒能听见她似的。真嗣在屏幕上看着她的眼睛。她回望着他，眉头紧锁……不仅仅是因为使徒。他点点头。她也点头回应。  
  
  
  
Shinji then leapt out of cover and fired three times at the sphere... Which vanished. At the same time, a shadow appeared under Unit 01's feet, and the Evangelion started to sink inside. Shinji shouted in his Entry Plug. "Asuka ! Don't stay in the shadow !"  
真嗣随即从掩体中跃出，对着球体连开三枪...球体却消失了。与此同时，初号机脚下出现了一片阴影，机体开始下沉。真嗣在插入栓内大喊：“明日香！别待在阴影里！”  
  
  
  
Asuka, seeing the black void expand close to her made her Eva jump and climb the building she used as cover.  
明日香看到黑色虚空向自己逼近，使得她的 EVA 跳起并攀上了她作为掩体的建筑物。  
  
  
  
"Shinji, get out of there ! Shinji ?" Misato's panicked voice didn't reach his ears though, as he kept looking at the black and white sphere in terror.  
“真嗣，快离开那里！真嗣？”美里惊慌失措的声音并未传入他的耳中，因为他仍惊恐地盯着那个黑白球体。  
  
  
  
"Ikari !" Rei said in a worried tone which nobody registered.  
“碇！” 绫波用担忧的语气说道，但没有人注意到。  
  
  
  
"Baka, what are you doing ?" Asuka shouted. Her voice finally breaking him out of his trance. "Asuka ! Misato ! Ayanami !" His terrified screams filled her with terror. She reached the top of her building and jumped from one to the other as fast as she could until she grabbed Unit 01's forearm."Shinji ! I got you !" Mustering all her strength, she managed to make Unit 01 rise a little.  
“笨蛋，你在干什么？” 明日香喊道。她的声音终于让他从恍惚中惊醒。“明日香！美里！绫波！” 他惊恐的尖叫声让她充满了恐惧。她迅速爬上楼顶，从一个跳到另一个，尽可能快地直到抓住了初号机的手臂。“真嗣！我抓住你了！” 她用尽全力，设法让初号机稍微升起了一点。  
  
  
  
"No ! Go away !" Despite his fear, he still wanted her not to be harmed no matter what the cost. "Get to safety !"  
“不！走开！” 尽管他害怕，但他仍然希望她不要受到任何伤害，无论代价如何。“快去安全的地方！”  
  
  
  
"You think I'm gonna leave now ? What are you, stupid ? Did _you_ leave when I was falling in that volcano ? Now help me and climb !" Both of them pulled with all their strength and Unit 01 kept on rising, albeit slowly. Its progress reversed quickly, however, when the building on which Unit 02 was started to sink as well. Asuka pulled harder, her arm straining painfully, but Shinji's Eva kept on sinking. "Let go Asuka ! You don't have a choice now !" Shinji was scared but he tried to hide it, so that she would actually accept. "I'll be okay."  
“你以为我现在会离开吗？你是不是傻？我掉进火山的时候你走了吗？现在帮我一把，爬上来！”两人都使出全力拉扯，初号机缓缓上升。然而，当零号机所在的建筑物也开始下沉时，初号机的上升势头迅速逆转。明日香更用力地拉，手臂痛苦地紧绷，但真嗣的 Eva 仍在下沉。“放手吧，明日香！你现在别无选择！”真嗣害怕，但他试图隐藏，以便她能接受。“我会没事的。”  
  
  
  
"Asuka..." Misato joined the conversation. Her voice was low, but with such authority that no one could have argued with her. "Retreat... That's an order... You too, Rei."  
“明日香……”美里加入了对话。她的声音低沉，却带着不容置疑的权威，没人能反驳她。“撤退……这是命令……你也是，绫波。”  
  
  
  
Shinji nodded to her as calmly as he could and smiled as much as he could, given the circumstances. "I'll be okay." he repeated in a whisper, before easing his Eva's grip. Asuka reluctantly let go, but kept her eyes locked on his as his Eva disappeared into the shadow. When its horn finally disappeared, so did Shinji's image in her cockpit.  
真嗣尽可能平静地点头向她微笑，尽管情况如此。“我会没事的。”他低声重复，然后放松了 Eva 的握力。明日香不情愿地放手，但目光始终锁定在他身上，直到他的 Eva 消失在阴影中。当它的角最终消失时，真嗣在她驾驶舱中的影像也随之消失。  
  
  
  
Rei had watched everything from a distance, her face devoid of any expression, or so it seemed. She _was_ concerned for Shinji's safety. So she had pushed her Eva forward without having been given the order, having discarded her sniper rifle before rushing through the buildings towards the edge of the shadow. She abruptly stopped when she heard her commanding officer's order to retreat.  
丽在远处目睹了一切，脸上似乎毫无表情。她对真嗣的安全感到担忧。因此，她未经命令便推动了 Eva 前进，在冲向阴影边缘的建筑群前，她已丢弃了狙击步枪。当听到指挥官撤退的命令时，她突然停了下来。  
  
  
  
Asuka stayed still a few seconds, gathering her thoughts before making her Eva jump on another building, then another... She had cut all communications so that nobody would mess with her focus. And also to hide her own face, as she was unable to hide her emotions at the moment. 'He has not abandoned me ! He will come back ! He told me he was going to be okay ! He can't abandon me. He can't...' She jumped on a more than half sunk building which rocked with the impact. Surprised, Asuka lost her balance. She gripped at its edge, but as she struggled to climb back on the building's roof, it shifted like a sinking concrete raft on a sea of darkness. She was trapped. She couldn't do anything to escape the shadow that was quickly engulfing the building as well as her Eva, so she stopped struggling altogether and let her Eva sink before the shocked eyes of the whole crew inside the Command center and the desperate screams of Misato, who had a communication forcibly restored with Asuka's Entry plug.  
明日香静立片刻，整理思绪后操控 Eva 跃向另一栋建筑，接着又是一栋...她切断了所有通讯，以免任何人干扰她的专注。同时也为了掩饰自己的面容，因为她此刻无法掩饰内心的情感。'他没有抛弃我！他会回来的！他告诉我他会没事的！他不能抛弃我。他不能...'她跳上一座半沉的建筑，撞击使其摇晃。明日香惊慌失措，失去平衡。她紧抓边缘，却在努力攀回屋顶时，建筑如沉没的混凝土筏子在黑暗之海中漂移。她被困住了。面对迅速吞噬建筑与 Eva 的阴影，她无计可施，只得停止挣扎，任由 Eva 沉没，在指挥中心全体人员的震惊目光下，以及通讯被强行恢复后美里绝望的尖叫声中。

### Chapter 4 : Starving in the belly of a whale

As always every feedback is appreciated ! It's my first time writing something like this, and I'm not a native English speaker so everything will help !  
一如既往，每一份反馈都弥足珍贵！这是我第一次尝试写这样的作品，而且我也不是英语母语者，所以任何建议都将大有裨益！  
  
  
  
  
Asuka had accepted her fate when the last patch of red of her Eva disappeared into the Shadow. She had been surprised, and relieved, as a consequence, to see that she wasn't dead. Her military training instinctively kicked in. She ran a series of tests. She first saw that she could move her Eva's limbs, even though walking didn't seem to achieve anything. She then tried to see if her sensors and radars could pick up anything... Nothing. She cut the power off her Eva and initialized the life support systems. 4'22. Roughly 13 hours until her Eva's life support would fail. Hesitantly, almost reluctantly, she pushed the button on her butterfly handle to open a communication window.  
当零号机的最后一抹红色消失在阴影中时，明日香已接受了自己的命运。她惊讶而又释然地发现自己并未死去。她的军事训练本能地启动了。她进行了一系列测试。首先，她发现能够操控零号机的四肢，尽管行走似乎毫无成效。接着，她尝试使用传感器和雷达探测周围...一无所获。她关闭了零号机的电源，并启动了生命维持系统。4 分 22 秒。大约 13 小时后，零号机的生命维持系统将失效。犹豫着，几乎是不情愿地，她按下了蝴蝶形操纵杆上的按钮，打开了一个通讯窗口。  
  
  
  
"... Shinji ?.. Can you hear me ?.." She asked calmly. When she didn't get an answer though, she snapped 'That idiot ! He can get an A on a test but not in the real world ! And what do I do ? I go after him like a goddamn amateur ! That's just great !' "Shinji ! You goddamn coward ! That's all your fault ! And believe me, I'm gonna kick your ass once we get out of here !" She shouted at her radio, with a hint of hope that the threat, no, the _promise_ would at least make him squirm. At least she wouldn't feel as alone then... But for right now, she felt _far_ more furious than alone. 'That jerk !'  
"“... 真嗣？... 你能听到我吗？”她平静地问道。然而，当她没有得到回答时，她突然爆发了：“那个白痴！他能在考试中得 A，但在现实世界中却不行！我该怎么办？像个该死的业余爱好者一样去找他！真是太棒了！”她对着无线电大喊：“真嗣！你这个该死的懦夫！这都是你的错！相信我，等我们离开这里，我一定会踢你的屁股！”她带着一丝希望，威胁，不，承诺至少能让他感到不安。至少那样她不会感到那么孤单...但此刻，她感到更多的是愤怒而不是孤单。“那个混蛋！”

Shinji looked at the blinding white landscape before him in awe for some time. 'Am I inside the Angel ? Am I dead ?' He paused. 'At least I managed to protect Asuka. Now that they know what the Angel can do, Misato _will_ find a plan to exterminate it... And I'm still alive, maybe they'll save me too. I'm sorry Asuka'  
"真嗣惊叹地看着眼前耀眼的白色景象。“我是在使徒体内吗？我死了吗？”他停顿了一下。“至少我设法保护了明日香。既然他们知道了使徒的能力，美里会找到消灭它的计划...而我仍然活着，也许他们也会救我。对不起，明日香。”  
  
  
  
He tried his sonars and radars to no avail. He tried to reach someone, anyone. If only to let them know he was still alive. To let her know. He wanted her to know. He still wasn't sure of what she felt towards him, but he knew that she would like to know. He remembered her eyes before he vanished. 'Was she scared for me ? She seemed scared of losing me. I think... I... Hope ?' He put these selfish thoughts aside and went back to his immediate reality. 'I should activate life support. If there's a chance that they save me, all I can do is give them as much time as possible.' He reasoned, activating it. '4'38, that's 14 hours, give or take. I'll die in 14 hours. I don't want to die, I want to see her again. I owe her an apology.'  
他尝试使用声纳和雷达，却毫无效果。他试图联系任何人，哪怕只是让他们知道他还活着，让她知道。他希望她知道。他仍不确定她对他的感觉，但他知道她会想知道。他记得消失前她的眼神。'她为我担心吗？她似乎害怕失去我。我想...我...希望？'他把这些自私的想法放在一边，回到眼前的现实。'我应该启动生命维持系统。如果有机会获救，我能做的就是尽可能争取时间。'他推理着，启动了系统。'4'38，大约 14 小时，或多或少。我将在 14 小时内死去。我不想死，我想再见她一面。我欠她一个道歉。'

Asuka opened her eyes slowly, as if she did not want to acknowledge the situation. She didn't want to be in her entry-plug. It was the first time she could recall that she ever felt that way. Even when she spent hours and hours training, she always liked being in there.  
明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，仿佛不愿承认当前的处境。她不想待在插入栓里。这是她第一次有这种感觉。即使她花了无数小时训练，她总是喜欢待在那里。  
  
  
  
"Scheiß !" She couldn't stand it. She didn't feel the usual comfort and warmth she was used to anymore. Suddenly, she had trouble breathing. She felt as if the LCL was burning her throat and lungs.  
“该死！”她无法忍受了。她不再感受到往常的舒适与温暖。突然间，她呼吸困难起来。她感觉仿佛 LCL 在灼烧她的喉咙和肺部。  
  
  
  
"Let me out !" She shouted at the top of her lungs before slamming the button to synchronize with her Eva. She then started to scream furiously in English, German and Japanese as she lashed out with her Eva, trying to grab onto something... Anything to rip out, stomping and punching the "ground" she believed she was standing on. She projected her AT-field in various directions, trying to find an opening, or create one, to slice the Angel from the inside. Destroy it and be free of this coffin.  
“放我出去！”她用尽全力喊道，随即猛击按钮与她的 Eva 同步。然后她开始用英语、德语和日语愤怒地尖叫，操纵 Eva 四处抓取……任何可以撕裂的东西，践踏和猛击她以为自己站立的“地面”。她向各个方向投射 AT 力场，试图找到一个出口，或是创造一个，从内部将使徒切开。摧毁它，摆脱这个棺材。  
  
  
  
She quickly stopped when she realized what she was doing and immediately turned off her Eva. Her outburst hadn't lasted long but it had been enough to drain a significant amount of the precious energy stored in her internal batteries.  
她很快意识到自己在做什么，立刻关闭了 Eva。她的爆发并未持续太久，但已足以消耗掉她体内电池中储存的大量宝贵能量。  
  
"Why did I do that ? I just doomed myself... Maybe that's better. Better to die sooner rather than later, waiting for my end for excruciating hours. I doubt that Wondergirl will be able to perform a miracle. And the only one... No, that's not true. One of the only ones who would have honestly mourned me will die here as well. He will... Die... With me."  
“我为什么要那么做？我这是在自掘坟墓……或许这样更好。早死早超生，总比在无尽的痛苦中等待死亡要好。我不认为奇迹少女能创造奇迹。而唯一一个……不，不是唯一。少数几个会真心为我哀悼的人也将和我一同死在这里。他会……和我一起死去。”  
  
  
  
The thought terrified her, so she squeezed her eyes shut to try to make the memories go away. She forced herself to think about other things. It always more or less worked when she focused hard enough. And right now, she needed to. She went back to her training, to her life in Germany when she was under Kaji's care and finally drifted back to that night when Shinji and her slept in her bed. The comfort she didn't even know she needed she received when in his arms. Their kiss. These managed to calm her mind so she clung to them as she tried once again to fall asleep.  
这个念头让她恐惧不已，于是她紧闭双眼试图驱散这些记忆。她强迫自己想些别的事情。每当她集中精神时，这或多或少都能奏效。而现在，她迫切需要这样。她回想起自己的训练，回想起在德国时在加持的照顾下的生活，最后回到了那晚她和真嗣睡在她的床上。在真嗣的怀抱中，她得到了那份她未曾意识到的慰藉。他们的吻。这些记忆安抚了她的心灵，她紧紧抓住它们，再次尝试入睡。

Shinji initialized Unit 01 and ran his scans. He didn't count how many times he did them since getting trapped but he felt uneasy. Each time he hoped that he would get an answer, or see something different. Or catch something on his radars.  
真嗣启动了初号机并进行扫描。自从被困以来，他记不清自己进行了多少次扫描，但心中始终不安。每次他都希望得到答案，看到不同的结果，或是捕捉到雷达上的异常。  
  
  
  
"Asuka ?.. Misato ?.. Ayanami ?.." His voice remained calm, tainted with some kind of resignation.  
"明日香？……美里？……绫波？……" 他的声音依旧平静，却带着某种无奈的意味。  
  
  
  
"I still have 10 hours left." It would have been more if he hadn't drained his internal batteries with these -too frequent- scans. "I'm hungry. I wish I could cook something for us again..." Shinji imagined himself back to the apartment, sharing a nice dinner that he would have prepared for the three of them to enjoy. Maybe a German meal...  
"我还剩下 10 个小时。" 如果不是因为这些过于频繁的扫描耗尽了他的内部电池，本可以更久的。"我饿了。真希望能再为你们做顿饭……" 真嗣想象着自己回到公寓，与她们共享一顿由他精心准备的晚餐。或许是德国菜……

"The LCL is becoming murky. The filtration system's power is running out. A few more hours and I won't have enough oxygen. My breathing will become shallower and shallower. The LCL will bring me less and less oxygen. I'll become lightheaded, and tired, and finally I'll go to sleep. Forever."  
"LCL 变得浑浊了。过滤系统的能量即将耗尽。再过几个小时，我就没有足够的氧气了。我的呼吸会越来越浅，LCL 提供的氧气也会越来越少。我会感到头晕，疲惫，最终陷入永眠。  
  
  
  
Stating what she had learned during her training in Germany helped her in no way, but it kept her mind busy. She had spent most of her time trapped in her entry plug sleeping, but she was still tired. She just couldn't keep her eyes opened. "Maybe it'll be sooner than expected." she didn't bother anymore to keep her thoughts inside her head. "Maybe I'll be asleep when the time will come." She finally said before drifting back to sleep.  
提及在德国训练期间学到的东西对她毫无帮助，但至少让她的思绪保持忙碌。她大部分时间都困在插入栓里睡觉，却依然感到疲惫。她就是无法睁开眼睛。“也许会比预期来得更早。”她不再费心隐藏自己的想法。“也许当那一刻到来时，我会已经睡着了。”她终于说道，随后再次陷入沉睡。

Night had fallen over Tokyo-3, so the temporary command center had to be illuminated with construction lamps. Ritsuko was standing before a dozen NERV employees, among them were Misato and Rei. Behind her was a white board with black patterns and writing in several languages. It looked like Ritsuko was a teacher and the others were her students, had it not been for their NERV uniforms.  
夜幕已降临东京-3，因此临时指挥中心不得不依靠施工灯照明。律子站在十几名 NERV 员工面前，其中包括美里和丽。她身后是一块白板，上面布满了黑色图案和多种语言的文字。若非他们身着 NERV 制服，这场景倒像是一位教师在给学生们上课。  
  
  
  
"So that shadow is actually the Angel's body ?" Misato asked bewildered. She wasn't sure that she had understood everything right.  
“所以那阴影实际上是使徒的身体？”美里困惑地问道。她不确定自己是否完全理解了。

"Correct." Ritsuko answered. "It's six hundred eighty meters in diameter. With a thickness of three nanometers. Sustained within that ultra-thin space is an inverted AT-field." She kept on stating the facts she had gleamed from her researches in the past hours. "Abstract mathematics defines the region within as a Sea of Dirac. It could be connected to another universe." She said this last sentence with some kind of fascination, which would have frightened Misato if her mind had not been clouded with worry.  
"“正确。”律子回答道，“它的直径为六百八十米，厚度仅有三纳米。在这超薄的空间内，维持着一个反转的 AT 力场。”她继续陈述着过去几小时从研究中得出的结论，“抽象数学将其内部区域定义为狄拉克之海，它可能连接着另一个宇宙。”她带着某种迷恋说出了最后一句话，如果美里不是满心忧虑，这可能会让她感到恐惧。  
  
  
  
"What about the sphere ?" Misato asked while raising her hand.  
“那个球体呢？”美里举手问道。  
  
  
  
"It disappears when the imaginary circuit of the body closes. The object in the sky is only a shadow." Ritsuko answered again. Misato wasn't facing her anymore. She had turned her head in order to look at the black and white sphere which was still floating over Tokyo-3. It's top was dark, but the bottom was lit with the same lamps which were used at the temporary command center.  
"“当身体的虚幻回路闭合时，它就会消失。天空中的物体只是一个影子。”律子再次回答。美里已经不再面对她，而是转过头去，凝视着依旧悬浮在第三新东京市上空的那个黑白球体。它的顶部是暗的，但底部却被临时指挥中心使用的同款灯光照亮。”  
  
  
  
"So the black shadow that swallowed Units 01 and 02 is the target." Misato stated downcast. "What can we do against it ?"  
“那个吞噬了 01 和 02 号机的黑色影子就是目标。”美里沮丧地说道，“我们能拿它怎么办？”  
  
  
  
Rei was leaning against a NERV truck, a bit behind everyone else. She was paying attention to what was being said, but she was also thinking about her fellow pilots. A very subtle hint of worry could be seen on her face.  
绫波靠在一辆 NERV 的卡车旁，稍稍落后于其他人。她注意着正在说的话，同时也在思考着她的同伴们。她的脸上隐约可见一丝担忧。

When Asuka opened her eyes, she was not in her entry-plug anymore. Surprised, she looked around her. She was standing in front of a window, which gave a view of a fairly small room. On the opposite wall was another large window, the light shining through the venetian blinds indicated her that it led to the exterior. On the far left corner, there was a plant that she couldn't identify on a nightstand, and right next to it, at the center of the room, was a bed. There was someone on it. A small girl in a dark dress with long red hair. The light from the window, and the fact that her head was low made it so Asuka couldn't see her features, but she _knew_ who she was. She also recognized the hospital room.  
当明日香睁开眼睛时，她已不在插入栓内。惊讶之余，她环顾四周。她站在一扇窗前，窗外是一个相当小的房间。对面墙上还有另一扇大窗，透过百叶窗的光线表明它通向室外。在远处的左角，有一个她无法辨认的植物放在床头柜上，紧挨着它，房间中央是一张床。床上躺着一个人。一个穿着深色连衣裙、长着红色长发的小女孩。窗外的光线和她低垂的头让明日香看不清她的面容，但她知道她是谁。她也认出了这个病房。  
  
  
  
What the... ?"  什么鬼...？  
  
  
  
"You are afraid of death ?" said the silhouette on the bed. She wasn't moving. She didn't seem to be even breathing.  
“你害怕死亡吗？”床上的人影说道。她一动不动，似乎连呼吸都没有。  
  
  
  
"I am Asuka Langley Soryu ! I'm not afraid of anything !" Asuka quickly answered.  
“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！我什么都不怕！”明日香迅速回答道。  
  
  
  
"You are afraid of death ?" The silhouette's tone changed a little, becoming more affirmative.  
“你害怕死亡吗？”那个身影的语气稍稍变了，变得更加肯定。  
  
  
  
"I'm a soldier ! I know that each time I go to combat can be the last !"  
“我是一名士兵！我知道每一次上战场都可能是最后一次！”  
  
  
  
"You are afraid of death." The silhouette wasn't asking anymore.  
“你害怕死亡。”那个身影不再是在询问。  
  
  
  
"I'm thirteen ! Of course I'd rather have as much time as possible, but I accepted the possibility of dying when I became a Pilot !" Asuka was becoming more and more desperate. She didn't understand the situation and those five words seemed more powerful each time they were uttered.  
“我十三岁了！当然希望时间越多越好，但成为驾驶员的那一刻，我就接受了可能死亡的事实！” 明日香越来越绝望。她不明白现状，而这五个字每次说出口，都显得愈发有力。  
  
  
  
"You are afraid of death !" The silhouette seemed to be almost mocking her now.  
“你害怕死亡！” 那身影现在几乎像是在嘲弄她。  
  
  
  
"... I don't want to die." Asuka answered in a whisper, with tears in her eyes.  
“……我不想死。” 明日香低声回答，眼中含着泪水。  
  
  
  
"You are afraid of death."  
“你害怕死亡。”  
  
  
  
"..." She didn't answer. Instead, she focused on the few good things in her life. Living with Misato, even if she was the sloppiest human being on Earth, she was the big sister she never had. The time she spent with Kaji in Germany, and how good he had been to her, how he helped her during this time. Hikari, her best friend, even when she didn't deserve it. Her Eva, and how proud she was of being a pilot. How comfortable and warm she always felt in her entry-plug. Exactly like with Shinji. She felt good in his arms. And she was happier since that night. He was too, she could see it, when they were together they were able to stave off their respective demons... She liked his cooking too, even if she never...  
“……”她没有回答。相反，她专注于生活中为数不多的美好事物。与美里同住，尽管她是地球上最邋遢的人类，但她却是自己从未有过的大姐姐。在德国与加持共度的时光，以及他对她的好，在这段时间里他是如何帮助她的。光，她最好的朋友，即使她不配拥有。她的 Eva，以及作为一名驾驶员她感到多么自豪。在插入栓里她总是感到舒适和温暖。就像和真嗣在一起时一样。她在他怀里感觉很好。自从那个夜晚以来，她变得更快乐了。他也是，她能看出来，当他们在一起时，他们能够驱散各自的恶魔……她也喜欢他的烹饪，尽管她从未……  
  
  
  
"If you had died with her all these years ago, you wouldn't have experienced all this pain." The silhouette interrupted her thoughts. This sentence hit her like a ton of bricks, all her bad memories coming back to her at once, drowning all her previous recollections. She had considered the idea on some occasions, when her sorrow was almost too much to bear, but she had learned to live for herself.  
“如果你多年前和她一起死去，你就不会经历这一切痛苦。”那个身影打断了她的思绪。这句话像一吨砖头一样击中了她，所有糟糕的记忆一下子涌回，淹没了她之前的所有回忆。她曾在某些时刻考虑过这个想法，当她的悲伤几乎无法承受时，但她学会了为自己而活。  
  
  
  
"Now you are going to die alone... With him. So close yet too far away." The silhouette raised her head with an insane smile. Her face was the incarnation of madness. The dream vanished in front of Asuka's eyes but this face, her own face, was carved in her mind.  
"“现在你将孤独地死去……和他一起。如此接近却又遥不可及。”那身影抬起头，露出疯狂的笑容。她的面容是疯狂的化身。梦境在明日香眼前消散，但这张脸，她自己的脸，却深深烙印在她的脑海中。”  
  
  
  
"I don't want to die alone." Tears now mixed with the murky LCL as Asuka couldn't help but cry. She put her arms around her knees and curled into a ball.  
"“我不想孤独地死去。”泪水与混浊的 LCL 混合，明日香忍不住哭泣。她抱紧双膝，蜷缩成一团。”  
  
  
  
"... Shinji..." "“……真嗣……””  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
"Who's that ?" A voice very similar to Shinji's asked.  
“那是谁？”一个与真嗣声音极为相似的人问道。  
  
  
  
The alarm of a railroad gate could be heard, approaching then getting further away.  
可以听到铁路道口的警报声，由近及远。  
  
  
  
"Who ?.." Shinji repeated, a bit surprised. He didn't seem to have realized that he was not in his entry-plug anymore, or maybe he didn't care. He was now sitting in a rail coach. It was dusk, or dawn, he didn't know about that. All he knew was that the sun was low on the horizon and that it bathed the whole car in an orange light. It shone directly in front of him. Across from him, on the bench on the other side, was the silhouette of a small child that Shinji couldn't see clearly, the sun hitting it from behind. The train didn't seem to be moving, yet Shinji could clearly hear the sound of the wheels against the rails.  
“谁？..”真嗣重复道，有些惊讶。他似乎没有意识到自己已经不在插入栓里了，或者他根本不在乎。他现在正坐在一列火车车厢里。是黄昏还是黎明，他不清楚。他只知道太阳低垂在地平线上，将整个车厢沐浴在橙色的光芒中。阳光直射在他面前。对面长椅上，是一个小孩子的轮廓，真嗣看不太清楚，阳光从背后照射着。火车似乎没有移动，但真嗣却能清晰地听到车轮与轨道摩擦的声音。  
  
  
  
Shinji Ikari." The voice answered without inflection.  
"碇真嗣。" 那声音毫无感情地回答道。  
  
  
  
"That's me." Shinji retorted, a little surprised.  
" "那就是我。" 真嗣反驳道，略感惊讶。  
  
  
  
"I am you. This self incorporates another self. The self has always been composed of two selves."  
"我就是你。这个自我包含了另一个自我。自我始终由两个自我组成。"  
  
  
  
"Two ?" Shinji didn't quite understand what the voice was saying.  
“两个？” 真嗣不太明白那声音在说什么。  
  
  
  
"Yes, the self which is observed and the self which observes itself. To expound, the Shinji Ikari that exists in your mind is only one Shinji Ikari. There's also the Shinji Ikari in Misato Katsuragi's mind, The Shinji Ikari in Asuka Soryu's mind, the Shinji Ikari in Rei Ayanami's mind and the Shinji Ikari in Gendo Ikari's mind. All are different Shinji Ikari, but each of them is a true Shinji Ikari." The silhouette, the Shinji in the others' mind, explained as he would have told a child. "Your fear is of the Shinji Ikari who exists in the minds of others." It stated, as if it knew exactly how Shinji's mind worked.  
“是的，被观察的自我和观察自我的自我。详细来说，你心中的碇真嗣只有一个。还有美里卡苏拉吉心中的碇真嗣，明日香索尤心中的碇真嗣，绫波零心中的碇真嗣，以及碇源堂心中的碇真嗣。他们都是不同的碇真嗣，但每一个都是真正的碇真嗣。”那个身影，即他人心中的真嗣，像对孩子解释一样说道。“你的恐惧是对存在于他人心中的碇真嗣。”它说道，仿佛完全了解真嗣的内心。  
  
  
  
"I'm just afraid of being hated." Shinji answered, dumbfounded by the truth behind the silhouette's words. Images of people flashed before his eyes. Ideas which were forced into his mind. Toji punching him while Kensuke explained that Toji's sister was injured during the fight with the Third Angel. Misato yelling at him because he had refused to fall back during the Fourth Angel. His father telling him harshly to go away.  
“我只是害怕被讨厌。”真嗣回答，被身影话语背后的真相惊呆了。人们的影像在他眼前闪过。这些想法强行进入了他的脑海。东治打他，而剑介解释说东治的妹妹在与第三使徒的战斗中受伤。美里对他大喊，因为他拒绝在第四使徒面前撤退。他的父亲严厉地告诉他离开。  
  
  
  
"No, I don't want to hear this !" The sensation was strange. Shinji couldn't clearly identify which of his senses was used.  
“不，我不想听这个！”这种感觉很奇怪。真嗣无法清楚地分辨出是哪种感官在起作用。  
  
  
  
"You're afraid of being hurt. That's why you always run from reality. No one can justify life by linking happy moments into a rosary. In particular, I cannot." The silhouette said, implying that Shinji himself couldn't.  
“你害怕受伤。这就是为什么你总是逃避现实。没有人能通过将快乐时刻串成念珠来证明生命的正当性。尤其是我，做不到。”那个身影说道，暗示着碇真嗣自己也无法做到。  
  
  
  
"I've found someone that makes me happy. Someone who is happy with me !" The previous images were replaced by images of Asuka. Their week of sync training. Her smile when he saved her life in Mount Asama. The warmth of her body when they hugged. The absolute bliss he felt when they kissed. The sheer perfection of seeing her sleeping peacefully in his arms.  
“我找到了让我快乐的人。一个和我在一起感到快乐的人！”之前的画面被明日香的影像所取代。他们一周的同步训练。他在浅间山救她时她的笑容。他们拥抱时她身体的温暖。他们接吻时他感受到的绝对幸福。看到她在他怀里安详入睡的完美画面。  
  
  
  
"Are you _really_ happy with her ?" The silhouette taunted. "Is she ? Does she even like you ? Or like to spend time with you ?" As it kept on harassing Shinji with questions, it started to change. It was growing bigger, taller, with long red hair and a red outfit. Its smile was nefarious and its eyes full of hatred. "Maybe I'm just using you. Like your father." Its voice had changed as well.  
“你真的和她在一起快乐吗？”那个身影嘲弄道。“她呢？她喜欢你吗？还是喜欢和你共度时光？”随着它不断用问题骚扰真嗣，它开始发生变化。它变得更大、更高，有着长长的红发和红色的衣服。它的笑容邪恶，眼中充满了仇恨。“也许我只是利用你。就像你父亲那样。”它的声音也变了。  
  
  
  
"How is that possible ? How can you become her ? Is she here as well ?" Shinji was oscillating between fear and rage as he waited for the silhouette to answer.  
“这怎么可能？你怎么能变成她？她也在吗？” 真嗣在恐惧与愤怒之间摇摆，等待着那身影的回答。  
  
  
  
"She joined us a few seconds after you."  
“她在你之后几秒钟加入了我们。”  
  
  
  
With these words, Shinji understood what the silhouette really was. "NO ! Don't you dare hurt her ! I won't let you ! Release us !" In an instant, Shinji didn't care about what was happening, his mind was filled with rage and determination. The train vanished as if the Angel withdrew, taking with it a hallucination. Now back in his entry-plug, he synchronized with his Evangelion and let all his wrath free. He was breathing heavily, his heart was racing. He used all his Eva's remaining power in vain and continued shaking the butterfly handles after the internal timer reached 0:00, shouting and screaming and begging for it to move. He started to cry. "I have to save her... Please ! I don't care if I die, I just want her to be safe."  
听到这些话，真嗣明白了那身影的真实身份。“不！你敢伤害她试试！我不会让你得逞的！放我们出去！” 一瞬间，真嗣不再关心发生了什么，他的心中充满了愤怒和决心。列车如同被天使收回一般消失，带走了幻觉。现在回到插入栓中的他，与他的 EVA 同步，释放出所有的愤怒。他呼吸急促，心跳加速。他徒劳地使用了 EVA 剩余的所有能量，在内置计时器达到 0:00 后继续摇动蝴蝶操纵杆，呼喊、尖叫、恳求它移动。他开始哭泣。“我必须救她……求你了！我不在乎自己是否会死，我只希望她能安全。”  
  
  
  
Just when he was about to accept his and Asuka's fate, a white silhouette, as if it were made of light, appeared in front of him and floated towards him, cupping his cheek in her right hand before hugging him.  
就在他即将接受自己和明日香的命运时，一个由光芒构成的白色身影出现在他面前，向他飘来，用右手托住他的脸颊，随后拥抱了他。  
  
  
  
"Mother ?" He asked before the pressure of the LCL seemed to increase. He wasn't sure that this was true, but he couldn't help but feel lightheaded. The last thing he heard before he passed out was a muffled roar.  
“妈妈？”他问道，随即感到 LCL 的压力似乎增加了。他不确定这是否真实，但忍不住感到头晕目眩。昏迷前听到的最后声音是一声沉闷的咆哮。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
All that Asuka managed now was a state of half consciousness at best. Her body and mind were numb, her breathing shallow. Her plug suit still gave her some life support, since it still had more than half its energy reserve, but it couldn't do much against the lack of oxygen.  
明日香此刻最多只能维持半清醒状态。她的身心都麻木了，呼吸微弱。她的插入栓服仍提供一些生命支持，因为能量储备还剩一半以上，但对于缺氧的情况却无能为力。  
  
  
  
She slowly and tiredly opened her eyes to take in her surroundings. She couldn't see far, the LCL was too turbid now. She could barely discern her butterfly handles. She couldn't even see her own feet now. She had stopped curling into a ball, it took her way too much energy just holding her legs with her arms, so she sat back on her entry-plug's memory foam chair. 'So that's it.' Thinking was getting hard for her but it was one of the only things she kept forcing her to do just to ensure herself that she wasn't dead yet. 'I'm gonna die here... That's anticlimactic. I would have hoped to die fighting like a soldier... Or of old age, worshiped like a hero... I hope Shinji makes it out of here... He'll be better off without me anyway. I'm just a pathetic little girl. I'm a failure, that's why everyone abandoned me. It's my fault, not theirs... I hope he'll survive.'  
她缓缓地、疲惫地睁开双眼，环顾四周。视线所及之处模糊不清，LCL 的浑浊程度已让她难以远望。她勉强能辨认出蝴蝶把手，连自己的双脚都已看不见。她不再蜷缩成一团，仅是用手臂抱住双腿就耗尽了太多力气，于是她重新坐回到插入栓的记忆棉椅上。“就这样吧。”思考对她来说变得困难，但这是她唯一坚持强迫自己去做的事，只为确认自己尚未死去。“我会死在这里……这结局未免太平淡。我本希望能像战士一样战死……或是老去，被尊为英雄……希望真嗣能逃出去……没有我，他会过得更好。我只是个可悲的小女孩。我是个失败者，这就是为什么大家都离我而去。是我的错，不是他们的……希望他能活下来。”  
  
  
  
"You've been one of the few lights in my life Shinji." she said in ragged breaths. "I'll be forever grateful for that." She paused, reflecting on how much she cared for the boy. She would have shed a tear if her eyes had been opened. The LCL made it awkward and unpleasant to talk, but she still had some things she wanted to say out loud, even if her voice wasn't much more than a whisper.  
“真嗣，你一直是我生命中的少数光芒。”她喘息着说道，“我将永远感激这一点。”她停顿了一下，思考着自己对少年的深厚感情。如果她的眼睛是睁开的，她可能会流下一滴泪。LCL 使得说话变得尴尬而不适，但她仍有一些话想大声说出来，即使她的声音微弱得几乎听不见。  
  
  
  
"Thank you, Shinji. See you soon, Mama."  
“谢谢你，真嗣。很快就能见到妈妈了。”  
  
  
  
With her fading consciousness she failed to notice the tremors around her. Her Eva had been trembling for the past minute or so. She hadn't even noticed the ear-splitting noises and inhuman roars outside.  
随着意识的逐渐消退，她未能察觉到周围的颤动。她的 EVA 已经颤抖了一分钟左右。她甚至没有注意到外面震耳欲聋的噪音和非人的咆哮声。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
"A forced Eva salvage ?" Misato wanted to know about the plan Ritsuko came up with, but she knew something was wrong as soon as she heard how it had been phrased.  
“强制回收 EVA？”美里想知道律子提出的计划，但她一听这措辞就知道有问题。  
  
  
  
"It's the only possibility that might work." Answered the doctor. "We would drop all 992 existing N2 mines into its center, while simultaneously activating the AT Field of the other Eva, disrupting the circuit enclosing the Angel's pocket interior. If we concentrate enough power into the same microsecond, we might destroy the Angel and the Dirac Sea that makes it up." She managed to say without giving away how much she hated the idea. She was able to hide her true feelings thanks to -or because of- the time she had spent working with Commander Ikari. It always made it easier for her to think about the big picture.  
“这是唯一可能奏效的办法。”医生回答道，“我们将所有 992 枚现存的 N2 地雷投放到其中心，同时激活其他 EVA 的 AT 力场，扰乱包围天使内部口袋的电路。如果我们能在同一微秒内集中足够能量，或许能摧毁天使及其构成的狄拉克海。”她尽量不表露出对这个计划有多么厌恶。多亏（或是因为）与碇司令共事的时间，她总能隐藏自己的真实情感，这让她更容易从大局考虑。  
  
  
  
"But the damage to the Evas would be... Shinji and Asuka wouldn't... What kind of rescue operation is this ?" Misato was getting angrier and angrier at each word pronounced by her friend.  
“但 EVA 的损伤会……真嗣和明日香不会……这算什么救援行动？”美里每听朋友说一个字，怒气就愈发高涨。  
  
  
  
"This operation's priority is to recover the Evas themselves. That the bodies may be damaged or destroyed has no bearing." Ritsuko replied coldly.  
“此次行动的首要任务是回收 Eva 本身。至于驾驶员的身体是否受损或被毁，无关紧要。”律子冷冷地回答道。  
  
  
  
Misato couldn't control herself anymore. Ritsuko just told her that her pilots were completely expendable. The only thing important to her seemed to be the Eva. She couldn't believe her ears. Her head was spinning. There were too many things she didn't know about the Evas, but that wasn't important at the moment. "Now wait a second !" She snapped back at her.  
美里再也控制不住自己了。律子刚刚告诉她，她的驾驶员们完全是可牺牲的。对她来说，似乎只有 Eva 才是重要的。她简直不敢相信自己的耳朵。她的头脑一片混乱。关于 Eva，她还有很多不知道的事情，但此刻这并不重要。“等等！”她厉声回击。  
  
  
  
As if on cue, the Shadow which constituted the body of the Angel started to crackle and break apart in a deafening noise. A red liquid erupted from the freshly opened wounds. The whole body of the Angel was bleeding.  
仿佛是按了开关，构成使徒身体的阴影开始噼啪作响并破裂，发出震耳欲聋的噪音。鲜红的液体从新开的伤口中喷涌而出。使徒的整个身体都在流血。  
  
  
  
"What's happening ? Could it be..."  
“发生了什么？难道是……”  
  
  
  
Misato was interrupted by Ritsuko "Impossible ! It would take an enormous amount of energy to break through ! Neither of the Evangelions are capable of this !"  
美里的话被律子打断：“不可能！突破需要巨大的能量！两台 EVA 都做不到这一点！”  
  
  
  
The next thing they saw proved her wrong. The black and white sphere hovering over Tokyo 3 turned black as a red arm pierced through it in a fountain of blood. Then another. The arms tore a hole in the sphere, revealing two glowing white eyes. Eva-01 pushed itself halfway out of the sphere before howling its superiority over its fallen foe. The sphere, not able to sustain itself in the air anymore, exploded in a rain of bloody parts and gore. Unit-01 landed on the ground in that rain of blood. At the same time, Unit-02 crashed face first close to it on the asphalt.  
接下来的一幕证明她错了。悬浮在第三新东京市上空的黑色与白色球体突然变黑，一条红色的手臂像血泉般穿透了它，接着又是一条。这些手臂在球体上撕开了一个洞，露出了两只发光的白色眼睛。零号机将自己从球体中推出一半，然后咆哮着宣告对倒下的敌人的优越。球体无法再维持在空中，爆炸成一片血肉和残骸的雨。零号机在这血雨中降落到地面。与此同时，二号机面朝下重重地摔在它附近的柏油路上。  
  
  
  
"My God, what kind of monster have we copied from ?" Ritsuko asked nobody in particular. She was too transfixed by the sight of the howling Evangelion before her eyes.  
“我的天，我们复制了什么样的怪物？”律子不针对任何人地问道。她被眼前咆哮的 EVA 震慑得目不转睛。  
  
  
  
Misato heard her and filed this information for later use. For now, she was too impatient to see how her charges were to think about anything else. She took her phone and called the command center "Eject the entry-plugs and send recovery teams ASAP !" She ordered while running to see her pilots for herself.  
美里听到了她的话，暗自记下这条信息以备后用。眼下，她急于了解她的孩子们的状况，无暇顾及其他。她拿起手机，拨通指挥中心：“立即弹出插入栓，并尽快派遣回收小组！”她一边命令着，一边跑去亲自查看她的驾驶员们。

AN : Well, this was tough to write ! Sorry for the cliffhanger. It wasn't my intention to finish the chapter at this point, but it got bigger than I thought, so I chose to cut it into two parts. The good news is that the next chapter is well underway and should come relatively quickly !  
作者注：哎，这段写起来真不容易！抱歉留了个悬念。我本意并非在此结束这一章，但内容超出了我的预期，所以决定分成两部分。好消息是，下一章已经在顺利进行中，应该很快就能与大家见面了！  
  
  
  
Thanks for reading !  
感谢阅读！

### Chapter 5 : I beg your pardon

Hey !  
  
Here's the new chapter ! As I said I had most of it already done when I decided to divide the previous one into two, so enjoy ! And thanks for reading !  
新章节来啦！正如我所说，当我决定将上一章分成两部分时，大部分内容已经完成了，尽情享受吧！感谢阅读！  
  
  
  
  
When Asuka regained consciousness, the first thing she saw was white. A blinding white overwhelming her. She had to blink several times to adjust to the light. It wasn't intense, but after spending such a long time in almost complete darkness, it was as blinding to her as looking directly at the sun.  
当明日香恢复意识时，她首先看到的是一片白色。一片令人目眩的白色笼罩着她。她不得不眨了几次眼来适应光线。这光线并不强烈，但经历了长时间的几乎完全黑暗后，对她来说就像直视太阳一样刺眼。  
  
  
  
When she managed to see where she was, her first reaction was to scream at the top of her lungs. The face of a nurse appeared a few seconds later, framed in the porthole in front of Asuka's face.  
当她设法看清自己所在的地方时，她的第一反应是放声尖叫。几秒钟后，一张护士的脸出现在明日香面前的舷窗中。  
  
  
  
"Good. You're awake. You suffered from minor oxygen deprivation, we had to put you in a hyperbaric chamber to help you recover. It won't...  
“很好，你醒了。你经历了轻微的缺氧，我们不得不把你放进高压氧舱帮助恢复。这不会……”  
  
  
  
She was interrupted by a very angry redhead, and neither the oxygen mask she wore nor the metal of the diving chamber muffled her ire.  
她的话被一个非常愤怒的红发女子打断，无论是她戴的氧气面罩还是潜水舱的金属，都没能减弱她的怒火。  
  
  
  
"And who the hell is the genius who thought that _this_ would be a good idea ?" The poor nurse was transfixed, she couldn't even blink as she stayed looking at her patient and persecutor through the porthole. "Gott ! And you tied me up ?!" She tried moving her arms and legs, which were tightly restrained with straps attached to her metal "bed". "I just spent Gott knows how long in a metal tube, I almost _died_ in there and where am I now ? In a goddamn metal tube ! Do you want me to become claustrophobic ? Open this right now and untie me !"  
“这他妈是谁想出的馊主意？”可怜的护士被吓呆了，她甚至无法眨眼，只能透过舷窗看着她的病人兼迫害者。“天哪！你们还把我绑起来了？！”她试图移动被紧紧束缚在金属“床”上的手脚，那些带子牢牢地固定着她。“我刚刚在一个金属管里待了上帝才知道多久，差点死在里面，现在我在哪儿？在一个该死的金属管里！你们是想让我得幽闭恐惧症吗？马上打开这东西，给我松绑！”  
  
  
  
When she saw an opening, Ritsuko spoke. "I'm the one responsible for this. We had to..." She struggled a few seconds to vulgarize what she had in mind. "make sure you had enough oxygen in your organism." She was looking at Asuka's vital signs monitor. "I can see that you're not suffering from anything too serious, we can get you back to a regular hospital room."  
当她看到一个开口，律子开口了。“我是负责这件事的人。我们必须……”她挣扎了几秒钟，试图将她的想法通俗化。“确保你的身体有足够的氧气。”她看着明日香的 vital signs 监测器。“我能看出你没有遭受太严重的状况，我们可以把你送回普通病房。”  
  
  
  
"If I don't have anything serious, I want to go back home ! I hate this place." Asuka retorted dryly.  
“如果我没有严重问题，我想回家！我讨厌这个地方。”明日香冷冷地反驳道。  
  
  
  
"It would be wiser to stay here on observation." Ritsuko said as she typed the opening sequence of the hyperbaric chamber on its small keyboard and then started to release Asuka from her restraints.  
“留在这里观察会更明智。”律子说着，在小键盘上输入了高压氧舱的启动序列，然后开始解除明日香的束缚。  
  
  
  
"I live with the goddamn Major of NERV. Not to mention another _pilot_." She snarled when uttering this last word. She was still a bit mad at Shinji, but she really wanted to see him right now. She just did it so nobody would suspect that. "I'm sure that if I have something, _anything_ wrong, Baka Shinji will give me a piggy back ride right to the hospital. Probably using the opportunity to cop a feel ! That pervert !"  
“我和 NERV 的那个该死的大校住在一起。更别提还有另一个驾驶员。”她咬牙切齿地说出最后这个词。她对真嗣仍有些恼火，但此刻她真的很想见到他。她只是不想让任何人察觉到这一点。“我敢肯定，如果我有什么事，哪怕是小事，笨蛋真嗣也会背我直奔医院。八成还会趁机揩油！那个变态！”  
  
  
  
Ritsuko sighed "Alright. I guess you can go home. Furthermore, if anything happened to you, the Section 2 team guarding you could get you back here faster than Shinji. But be careful. I'm going to call Misato. We'll have your clothes brought here, then you can wait for her at the reception desk." With that, she took her cellphone and left the room.  
律子叹了口气，“好吧。我想你可以回家了。而且，如果有什么事发生，第二分队的警卫可以比你那边的真嗣更快把你送回来。但要小心。我会打电话给美里。我们会把你的衣服送来，然后你可以在接待处等她。”说完，她拿起手机离开了房间。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
After a rather awkward and quite long bear hug, Asuka and Misato went to the latter's car. On the way home, Misato told her charge how the Angel died and what happened afterwards. She decided against telling her what the "plan" Ritsuko came up with to get rid of the Angel was though.  
经过一段相当尴尬且漫长的拥抱后，明日香和美里走向了后者的车。在回家的路上，美里向她的被监护人讲述了使徒是如何死亡以及之后发生的事情。但她决定不告诉明日香律子想出的那个“计划”，即如何消灭使徒。  
  
  
  
"I spent two days in that coffin ?! Gott that doctor hates me !" Asuka angrily said.  
“我在那棺材里待了两天？！那个医生肯定恨死我了！”明日香愤怒地说道。  
  
  
  
'You don't even know the half of it.' Misato thought before answering in her usual overly-cheerful-in-order-to-hide-something tone. "More like a day and a half. It was almost dawn when the Angel got destroyed." She shuddered when recalling the gruesome scene. "And it's almost 5. And you know it was for your own good. Oxygen deprivation can be pretty serious. Anyway, I still have a lot of paperwork so I'm just dropping you home, Shinji's already there, he'll take care of you."  
‘你连一半都不知道。’美里心想，然后用她一贯为了掩饰什么的过度欢快的语气回答。“更像是半天多一点。天使被消灭的时候都快天亮了。”她回想起那血腥的场面不禁打了个寒颤。“而且现在快五点了。你知道这都是为了你好。缺氧可是很严重的。总之，我还有很多文件要处理，所以只是送你回家，真嗣已经在那儿了，他会照顾你的。”  
  
  
  
"As if I needed someone to take care of me !" Asuka haughtily answered, then she saw an opportunity. "How's the idiot anyway ?"  
“好像我需要人照顾似的！”明日香傲慢地回答，然后她看到了一个机会。“那白痴怎么样了？”  
  
  
  
"Even more down than usual. He wasn't injured or anything during the battle, but I thinks he was worried about you. I'm sure that seeing you will cheer him up."  
比平时更加低落。他在战斗中并没有受伤，但我想他是在担心你。我相信见到你会让他振作起来。  
  
  
  
Asuka didn't answer, but smiled to herself. They went the rest of the way back home in silence. Misato left just after dropping Asuka in the parking lot, but not before teasingly saying "Don't do anything I wouldn't do !" which made her redheaded ward blush.  
明日香没有回答，只是自顾自地笑了。他们一路沉默地回到家。美里在停车场放下明日香后不久就离开了，临走前还不忘打趣地说：“别做我都不会做的事哦！”这让她的红发养女脸红了。  
  
  
  
When she entered the apartment, she was greeted by the pleasant smell of Shinji's cooking, and a few seconds later, by the sight of Shinji himself who was now just standing at the opposite end of the entryway, wearing an apron, looking at her with teary eyes. They looked at each other for a few agonizing seconds, every bit of anger she still felt towards him vanishing in that instant.  
当她走进公寓时，迎接她的是真嗣烹饪的诱人香气，几秒钟后，真嗣本人出现在入口的另一端，穿着围裙，泪眼汪汪地看着她。他们彼此凝视了几秒，她对他仍存的怒气在这一刻烟消云散。  
  
  
  
They then almost jumped at each other in unison and kissed. For the second time. And it was more passionate, more desperate because of how worried, how relieved and how happy they were to see each other. Shinji was crying tears of joy and they were both clinging to each other as for dear life, not daring to let go. After not long enough according to both of them, they broke the kiss. Asuka wiped Shinji's tears with her hands, and kept them there, cupping his cheeks. He was still holding her, his hands on her back.  
他们随即几乎同时向对方扑去，再次亲吻。这一次更加热烈，更加迫切，因为他们有多么担忧、多么释然、多么高兴能见到彼此。真嗣流下了喜悦的泪水，两人紧紧相拥，仿佛生死攸关，不敢松手。在他们看来，时间并未过去多久，便分开了这个吻。明日香用手拭去真嗣的泪水，并继续捧着他的脸颊。他依然拥抱着她，双手环在她的背上。  
  
  
  
"I'm sorry..." He said between sobs "I was so scared I lost you. They wouldn't let me see you when you were extracted from your entry-plug. Nobody told me anything... And I couldn't visit you at the hospital... I thought you were..."  
“对不起……”他哽咽着说，“我好害怕失去你。他们不让我在你从插入栓里被救出时见你。没人告诉我任何事……我也没法去医院看你……我以为你……”  
  
  
  
"Baka ! I'm fine ! I'm the Great Asuka Langley Soryu ! Don't forget that !" Her gaze dropped, as well as her head right after. "... But I failed... I couldn't save you. You had to save me instead."  
“笨蛋！我没事！我是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷！别忘了这一点！”她的目光随即低垂，头也跟着低下。“……但我失败了……我没能救你。反而是你救了我。”  
  
  
  
"I didn't do anything. When I saw you in... I don't know what it was... A hallucination maybe ?.. When I understood that you were trapped too, I snapped. Then something happened with the Eva and I fainted."  
“我什么都没做。当我看到你在……我不知道那是什么……或许是幻觉？……当我意识到你也陷入了困境时，我崩溃了。然后 Eva 发生了一些事，我就昏过去了。”  
  
  
  
"But I should have been the one to save you ! I'm a soldier ! I've been training for this my whole life ! That's all I am !" Her voice was desperate.  
“但我本应该是那个救你的人！我是个士兵！我一生都在为此训练！这就是我的一切！”她的声音充满了绝望。  
  
  
  
"Stop that !" He surprised her with how harsh his voice was. He was angry. "You are far more than a soldier ! You are the Asuka in Misato's mind, the Asuka in Ayanami's mind, the Asuka in my mind..." He paused, then continued. "I can't say what you are in the others' minds but..." He almost stopped, before adding in a whisper. "You are the most important person in mine..." She was speechless. "Y-you have a college degree, you... You are b-beautiful, and brilliant." He was drawing confidence by looking in her eyes. "And so stubborn that you can do anything that you set your mind to... That's what you are in my mind. And I know I'm right because I believe in you... And I-I ca-care about you."  
“别这样！”他严厉的语气让她吃惊。他很生气。“你远不止是一个士兵！你是美里心中的明日香，是绫波心中的明日香，是我心中的明日香……”他顿了顿，然后继续说。“我不能说你在其他人心中是什么，但是……”他几乎停了下来，然后低声补充道。“你是我心中最重要的人……”她无言以对。“你……你有大学学位，你……你美丽又聪明。”他通过凝视她的眼睛来汲取信心。“而且你如此固执，只要下定决心就能做到任何事……这就是你在我心中的样子。我知道我是对的，因为我相信你……而且我……我关心你。”  
  
  
  
She kissed him again, with all her passion, she hoped that it would be enough to make him understand what she wasn't ready to say yet. After some time, she looked at him with a smile. "Go finish our dinner ! I'm hungry and I need to take a shower.  
"她再次深情地吻了他，希望这份激情足以让他明白她尚未准备好说出口的话。过了一会儿，她微笑着看着他。“去把我们的晚餐完成吧！我饿了，还得洗个澡。”  
  
.  
  
.  
  
Dinner was almost ready, so Asuka sat down at the kitchen table to wait for her food. She was startled by something brushing her ankle but calmed down when she saw Pen Pen hugging her leg. Even though he was often scared by his newest roommate's outbursts, he had also grown quite fond of her since she moved in, he as a consequence expressed his relief with a "Wark !" before getting a beer and returning to his fridge. They ate in comfortable silence, stealing glances at each other, holding hands at times. As usual, Asuka finished her dinner quickly, but she waited for him to have finished as well before standing up.  
晚餐即将准备就绪，于是明日香坐在餐桌旁等待。突然，有什么东西蹭了她的脚踝，她吓了一跳，但看到是 Pen Pen 抱着她的腿时便放松下来。尽管他常被这位新室友的爆发吓到，但自从她搬进来后，他也变得相当喜欢她，于是他用一声“Wark！”表达了自己的安心，然后拿了一瓶啤酒回到冰箱旁。他们舒适地沉默用餐，不时偷瞄对方，偶尔牵着手。像往常一样，明日香迅速吃完晚餐，但她等他也吃完后才起身。  
  
  
  
"I'm going to take a shower, we'll go to bed after !"  
“我去洗个澡，之后我们就上床睡觉！”  
  
  
  
He nodded with red cheeks.  
他红着脸点了点头。  
  
  
  
A thought occurred to her then, one that she had while inside the Angel. "Thanks for the food Shinji, it was very good !" She added cheerily, before disappearing inside the bathroom.  
这时，她突然想起一件事，是她在天使内部时想到的。“谢谢你的食物，真嗣，非常好吃！”她愉快地补充道，然后消失在浴室里。  
  
  
  
Shinji blushed even more as he stood up and did the dishes while waiting for her. He allowed himself a sigh of relief. All the tension of the last days finally leaving him. 'She's okay ! I'm glad !" He waited serenely for her, lounging on the couch, a slight smile never leaving his face.  
真嗣的脸更红了，他站起来洗碗，同时等待着她。他松了一口气，连日来的紧张终于消散了。“她没事！我真高兴！”他平静地等待着她，慵懒地躺在沙发上，一丝微笑始终挂在脸上。  
  
  
  
In "their" bed, they held each other tightly. They knew that Misato wouldn't come back tonight so they enjoyed being together, comforting themselves with each other's warmth. Shinji finally broke the silence.  
在“他们”的床上，他们紧紧相拥。他们知道美里今晚不会回来，于是享受着彼此的陪伴，用对方的温暖安慰自己。真嗣终于打破了沉默。  
  
  
  
"I'm so... I shouldn't have told you those things before the battle." He almost apologized, but decided that he would wait this time. He wanted to do it only if it had been really justified.  
“我真是……我不该在战斗前告诉你那些事的。”他几乎要道歉，但这次决定等待。他只想在确实有理由时才这么做。  
  
  
  
"Yeah. I was pretty mad at you..." she answered calmly. She was relaxed, her eyes were closed, her ear close to his heart, listening to its soothing rhythmic thumps. She snuggled a bit closer. "Why did you say all this anyway ?"  
“嗯。我当时真的很生你的气……”她平静地回答。她很放松，眼睛闭着，耳朵贴近他的心脏，聆听着那令人安心的有节奏的跳动。她又往他怀里钻了钻。“你为什么要说这些呢？”  
  
  
  
"I..." He stammered and swallowed hard. He had hoped she wouldn't have pressed the matter. " I wanted to protect you. I was..."  
“我……”他结巴着，艰难地咽了口唾沫。他本希望她不会追问这件事。“我想保护你。我……”  
  
  
  
"Excuse me ?" She bolted upright, her calm having already disappeared. "You what ? Who the hell do you think you are ? Who the hell do you think _I_ am ? Do you think I'm just a helpless little girl ? After all you said to me before the battle, you have the guts to humiliate me like that ?" Shinji was paralyzed. He couldn't look her in the eyes. She hadn't been this angry in a long time, relatively speaking. "I'm Asuka Langley Soryu ! The Second Child ! I don't need your protection or your help ! I don't need anyone ! Get out !" She was screaming now "Get out of _my_ room !"  
“你说什么？”她猛地坐直，原本的平静已荡然无存。“你什么意思？你以为你是谁？你又以为我是谁？你以为我只是个无助的小女孩吗？在战斗前你对我说了那么多，现在居然有胆量这样羞辱我？”真嗣僵住了，不敢直视她的眼睛。她已经很久没有这么生气了，相对而言。“我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！第二适格者！我不需要你的保护或帮助！我不需要任何人！出去！”她现在尖叫着，“滚出我的房间！”  
  
  
  
Shinji knew better than to try and reason with her when she was this angry, so he stood up and left, mortified. "I'm sorry." He whispered as he closed the door and went to his room.  
真嗣知道在她这么生气的时候试图讲道理是徒劳的，所以他站起身，羞愧地离开了。“对不起。”他低声说着，关上门回到了自己的房间。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
This end to a pleasant evening marked the beginning of a really bad sleepless night for both Children of the Katsuragi residence. Shinji was crushed. Not only had he managed to ruin their reunion, he also managed to hurt Asuka in the process. He was hurt too, of course, but it was completely secondary in his mind. 'I'm so stupid ! I should have never doubted her. I only wanted to protect you, I just wanted you to be safe.'. But the damage was done. He had betrayed her. He picked up his SDAT from his desk and curled into a ball on his bed, listening to his music, tears falling from his eyes and soaking his pillow.  
这个愉快的夜晚的结束，对草薙家两兄妹来说，标志着一个真正糟糕的无眠之夜的开始。真嗣感到崩溃。他不仅搞砸了他们的重逢，还在这过程中伤害了明日香。当然，他自己也受了伤，但在他心中这完全次要。'我真蠢！我本不该怀疑她的。我只想保护你，只希望你安全。'但伤害已经造成。他背叛了她。他从书桌上拿起 SDAT，蜷缩在床上，听着音乐，泪水从眼角滑落，浸湿了枕头。  
  
  
  
It all had started so well, he had talked to her and told her things he never thought he would have had the courage to say. They kissed. Again. Again he felt her soft lips on his, her usual scent, albeit faint because of her time in the hospital and the entry-plug. Her warmth against him. The electricity he felt throughout his body as their lips met once again. It had been a perfect moment, that's why it felt even worse when it came crashing down because of him.  
一切开始得那么美好，他跟她交谈，说出了他从未想过自己会有勇气说的话。他们接吻了。又一次。他再次感受到她柔软的唇瓣，她惯有的香气，尽管因她在医院和插入栓中的时间而变得淡薄。她紧贴着他的温暖。当他们的唇再次相触时，他全身感受到的电流。那是一个完美的时刻，正因为如此，当这一切因他而崩溃时，感觉更加糟糕。  
  
  
  
Of course, if the rational part of his brain had been louder, maybe he would have realized that he had indeed kept her safe. That he had saved her life. That if he hadn't insisted to take point, she would have been the one to attack the Angel, she would have been alone stuck inside and she probably would have been dead right now, one way or the other.  
当然，如果他理性的大脑能更响亮些，或许他会意识到自己确实保护了她。他救了她的命。如果他没有坚持带头，她就会是那个攻击天使的人，她就会独自被困在里面，现在很可能已经死了，无论哪种方式。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
Anger is an efficient way to stay awake even when tired. Asuka knew that all too well. Hence, she had not been surprised that she couldn't sleep. She was very angry at Shinji, for humiliating her, for belittling her. She had stopped screaming as soon as he had closed her door. She just sat on her bed, breathing heavily, her eyes fixed on nothing in particular, yet not moving. Her mind was boiling with rage.  
愤怒是保持清醒的有效方式，哪怕在疲惫时也是如此。明日香对此再清楚不过了。因此，她并不惊讶自己无法入睡。她对真嗣非常生气，因为他羞辱了她，贬低了她。他一关上门，她就停止了尖叫。她只是坐在床上，呼吸沉重，眼睛盯着某个不特定的点，却一动不动。她的脑海中充满了愤怒。  
  
  
  
When she had calmed down, she had tried, and managed, to get some sleep. She knew that her rest hadn't been long though when she woke up sweating heavily because of a nightmare. 'I haven't had any since...' This fact was enough to re-ignite the fire of her fury. 'I don't need him ! I don't need anyone ! I can live for myself !' She had almost managed to convince herself when Misato's recollection of the Angel's death came back to her mind.  
当她情绪平复后，她尝试并成功地睡了一会儿。但她知道休息时间并不长，因为醒来时满头大汗，源于一场噩梦。'我已经很久没有做噩梦了...'这个事实足以重新点燃她的怒火。'我不需要他！我不需要任何人！我可以为自己而活！'就在她几乎要说服自己时，美里关于使徒死亡的回忆涌上心头。  
  
  
  
"_Unit-01 literally tore the Angel apart. There was so much blood._"  
"初号机简直把使徒撕成了碎片。血流成河。"  
  
  
  
'He saved my life. Or the Eva. Whatever. I couldn't do anything to break free. My Eva didn't do anything either... I shouldn't have reacted like that. I shouldn't have snapped like I did. It almost killed me in my Eva and now it made Shinji leave. And what he told me... I'm the most important person in his mind ? He cares about me...' Her train of thoughts trailed off as she stood up and changed her shirt. These last thoughts were tipping the scales back in Shinji's favor. She had some thinking to do. She didn't want to go back to sleep anyway. Not if it meant having to suffer through another nightmare.  
'他救了我的命。或者说，救了 EVA。无所谓了。我无法挣脱束缚。我的 EVA 也没有任何反应...我不该那样反应。我不该那样失控。那几乎让我在 EVA 中丧命，现在又让真嗣离开了。而他对我说的...我是他心中最重要的人？他在乎我...'她的思绪渐渐飘远，站起身来换了件衬衫。这些最后的想法让天平再次向真嗣倾斜。她需要好好思考。无论如何，她不想再睡了。如果这意味着要再次经历噩梦，她宁愿不睡。

Shinji left early in the morning, he didn't want to face Asuka. Since he had barely slept, he woke up earlier than usual to prepare their bentos and left the apartment to wander the streets of Tokyo-3 with his SDAT. He didn't see anything, he didn't hear anything. He was alone, his back bent under the weight of his sorrow. He arrived in class 2-A minutes before the bell rang. He saw that she was there too but didn't even glance at her.. He didn't see her watch him as he sat down. He didn't see how tired she was too.  
真嗣一大早就离开了，他不想面对明日香。由于几乎没怎么睡，他比平时更早醒来准备他们的便当，然后带着他的 SDAT 离开公寓，在第三新东京市的街道上徘徊。他什么也没看见，什么也没听见。他独自一人，背负着悲伤的重担。他在铃响前几分钟到达了 2-A 班。他看到她也在那里，但没有看她一眼。他没有注意到她在他坐下时注视着他。他也没有注意到她同样疲惫。  
  
  
  
When the lunch bell rang, he took their bentos from his bag and put Asuka's in a corner of his table, and went as far away from it as possible while still sitting on his chair. She came and grabbed it, then stood next to him. When he didn't move, she spoke. "You're coming with me, Third Child." Her voice was commanding, but not harsh.  
午餐铃响起时，他从包里拿出他们的便当，把明日香的放在桌子的一角，然后尽可能远离它，同时仍然坐在自己的椅子上。她走过来拿走了便当，然后站在他旁边。当他没有动时，她开口了。“你跟我来，第三适格者。”她的声音命令式，但并不严厉。  
  
  
  
Kensuke made a whipping noise with his mouth, getting some chuckles from nearby classmates. Toji stood up from his seat and pointed a finger at Asuka. "What's your problem Demon ? Can't you give Shin-Man a break once in a while ?" He knew that Shinji's behavior today was because of her, and he finally couldn't stay silent anymore.  
健介用嘴巴发出鞭打的声音，引得附近的同学发出几声轻笑。当麻从座位上站起来，用手指着明日香。“你有什么问题，恶魔？不能偶尔让真嗣休息一下吗？”他知道真嗣今天的行为是因为她，而他终于无法再保持沉默。  
  
  
  
Before Asuka could verbally abuse his friend, Shinji spoke up. "Thank you Toji, but that's alright. I'm not scared." His voice was filled with tiredness, but he didn't flinch. He knew that whatever Asuka was going to through at him, he had deserved it, so he stood up and silently followed her.  
在明日香能用言语攻击他的朋友之前，真嗣开口了。“谢谢你，阿薰，但没关系。我不害怕。”他的声音充满了疲惫，但他没有退缩。他知道无论明日香要对他做什么，他都应得，所以他站起来，默默地跟着她。  
  
  
  
"You're too used to it ! You have to fight back Shin-Man !" Toji retorted.  
“你太习惯这样了！你得反击啊，真哥！”阿薰反驳道。  
  
  
  
"Maybe he's not scared because he has iron balls." Kensuke muttered to himself.  
“也许他不害怕是因为他有铁胆。”健介自言自语道。  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
They walked together in silence for some time before reaching a quiet place under a tree with no one around to bother them. They sat down and opened their lunch boxes.  
他们一起沉默地走了好一会儿，直到来到一棵树下，四周无人打扰。他们坐下来，打开了午餐盒。  
  
  
  
"Where were you this morning ? I wanted to talk to you." Asuka broke the silence when it became too uncomfortable. He wasn't going to break the ice and she knew it.  
“你今早去哪儿了？我想和你谈谈。”当沉默变得过于尴尬时，明日香打破了沉默。她知道他不会主动打破僵局。  
  
  
  
"Around... I..." “在……我……”  
  
  
  
"You ran away, again." She cut him.  
“你又逃跑了。”她打断了他。  
  
  
  
"I didn't want to face you. I... I betrayed you. I'm..." He was cut once again by Asuka.  
“我不想面对你。我……我背叛了你。我……”他再次被明日香打断。  
  
  
  
"Don't even think about it." She said in a threatening tone. She took a few deep breaths before to calm herself continuing. "I can take care of myself." She paused. "But I had a lot of time to think last night. And I came to the conclusion that I enjoy not being dead in my entry-plug inside an Angel. And I owe it to you..." Shinji was looking at her now. He was staring in her deep blue eyes. He opened his mouth but was cut before a sound could escape it. "Let me finish... I like knowing that I can rely on you to have my back. I know that I can trust you, Shinji." She then awkwardly and quickly added "In battle. And I hope you know that you can trust me as well."  
“想都别想。”她用威胁的语气说道。深呼吸几次后，她平静下来继续说：“我能照顾好自己。”她顿了顿。“但昨晚我有很多时间思考。我得出的结论是，我喜欢自己没有在天使体内的插入栓里死去。这多亏了你……”真嗣现在看着她。他凝视着她深蓝色的眼睛。他张开嘴，但还没发出声音就被打断了。“让我说完……我喜欢知道有你在我背后支持我。我知道我可以信任你，真嗣。”她随后尴尬而迅速地补充道，“在战斗中。我希望你也知道可以信任我。”  
  
  
  
"I trust you, Asuka. I'm sorry, really sorry I mean. I didn't want to hurt you like that... I-it's just that... That it's the first time in my life I have something to lose. I-I didn't want to lose you. I just let my selfishness get the better of me." He looked down in shame.  
“我相信你，明日香。对不起，真的对不起。我并不想那样伤害你……我只是……这是我第一次在生活中有东西可以失去。我不想失去你。我只是让我的自私占了上风。”他羞愧地低下头。  
  
  
  
She wasn't expecting him to be this truthful, and was a little taken aback. She also didn't like to see him hurt like this, even if she wouldn't admit it to him. She could admit it to herself, but herself only. She decided to lighten the mood. "You know ? I never could have hoped for a better sidekick !" She said with a playful tone.  
她没想到他会如此坦诚，有些措手不及。她也不喜欢看到他这样受伤，尽管她不会向他承认。她只能对自己承认，仅此而已。她决定缓和气氛。“你知道吗？我从来没指望过能有一个更好的搭档！”她用一种俏皮的语气说道。  
  
  
  
It had exactly the effect she expected. "Sidekick ? Really ?" Shinji asked with sarcasm in his voice.  
这正是她预期的效果。“搭档？真的吗？”真嗣带着讽刺的语气问道。  
  
  
  
"You heard what I said." She smirked before continuing. "I also had time to think about our week of sync training. Do you remember it ?"  
“你听到了我说的话。”她微微一笑，接着说道，“我还有时间回想我们那一周的同步训练。你还记得吗？”  
  
  
  
Not liking where the conversation was going because of his attempt at kissing her in her sleep, Shinji turned his head away from her again. "Of course I do."  
由于之前试图在她熟睡时亲吻她，真嗣不喜欢这个话题的走向，于是再次把头转向一边。“当然记得。”  
  
  
  
"I really liked it back then." He looked at her in surprise. "You didn't hesitate as much. You stood your ground against me, you fought back !" She trailed off for a second. "I don't remember which day it was, and you probably don't remember as well... It must have been towards the end because you were really starting to get on my nerves. We were brushing our teeth and right when we finished we snarled at each other..."  
“那时候我真的很喜欢。”他惊讶地看着她。“你那时没有那么多犹豫。你坚定地站在我面前，还反击了！”她顿了一下。“我不记得是哪一天了，你大概也不记得了……应该是快结束的时候，因为你真的开始让我烦了。我们在刷牙，刚刷完就互相瞪着对方……”  
  
  
  
"Yeah ! I remember ! I just wanted this to be over. If it had continued much longer, I think I would have strangled you." He said jokingly. He had relaxed in the last minutes, and was just happy thinking back to this week, eating lunch with her. He felt very good at this moment.  
"“耶！我记得！我只是希望这一切快点结束。如果再继续下去，我想我可能会勒死你。”他开玩笑地说。在最后几分钟里，他放松了下来，回想起这一周，和她一起吃午饭，感到非常开心。此刻，他感觉非常好。”  
  
  
  
"... I almost kissed you right there and then." She blurted out. "Now I'm glad I didn't, since all you were thinking about was killing me." She said in mock indignation.  
"“……我差点就在那时那地吻了你。”她脱口而出。“现在我很庆幸没那么做，因为你满脑子想的都是杀了我。”她假装生气地说。”  
  
  
  
"Wa-wait ! R-really ?" He asked with wide eyes.  
"“等-等等！真-真的吗？”他瞪大眼睛问道。”  
  
  
  
"I told you I really liked it." She was blushing a little. Shinji, seeing her like this, couldn't help but reach out his hand to grab hers. She quickly -and violently- slapped it with her chopsticks.  
"“我告诉过你，我真的很喜欢。”她微微脸红。真嗣见她这副模样，忍不住伸手去握她的手。她迅速——且猛烈地——用筷子打了他的手。”  
  
  
  
"What's the hell do you think you're doing, idiot ? You think that I would let _you_ touch me ?" She shouted, before adding in a voice barely above a whisper. "Akagi more or less told me when I was at the hospital that we were under constant surveillance by Section 2. We can't do that in public, even if there's nobody around us."  
"“你到底在想什么，白痴？你以为我会让你碰我吗？”她喊道，然后压低声音补充道，“赤木差不多在我住院时告诉我，我们一直受到第二课的监视。我们不能在公共场合这样做，即使周围没人。””  
  
  
  
"Erm... On that note..." Shinji didn't want to sound hesitant, he just couldn't help himself.  
"“呃……说到这个……”真嗣不想显得犹豫，但他就是控制不住自己。”  
  
  
  
"I'm pretty sure I won't like what you're about to say." Her face was serious.  
“我很确定我不会喜欢你接下来要说的话。”她的表情严肃。  
  
  
  
He gathered his courage and spoke "I want to tell Misato."  
他鼓起勇气说道：“我想告诉美里。”  
  
  
  
"Yeah, that's what I thought. And I don't. As soon as she knows, she'll make a fuss and tell us to stop. She might go as far as asking me to move out !"  
“是啊，我就知道。而且我不希望这样。她一旦知道了，肯定会大惊小怪，让我们停止。她甚至可能会要求我搬出去！”  
  
  
  
"She's been nice to me when nobody else was. She took me in when even my father didn't want me around ! She's like a big sister to me. I can't hide this from her." He explained calmly.  
“当别人都不理我时，她对我很好。就连我父亲也不想让我在身边时，她收留了我！她对我来说就像个大姐姐。我不能对她隐瞒这件事。”他平静地解释道。  
  
  
  
"That's funny Ikari," She squinted her eyes while looking at him. "You usually stutter when you say things like that."  
“真有趣，一尻，”她眯起眼睛看着他。“你通常说这种话时会结巴的。”  
  
  
  
"I-it's really important to me." He stuttered.  
“这-这对我真的很重要。”他结巴道。  
  
  
  
"Okay I guess. But you let me do it." A plan was forming in her head as she spoke, and she didn't want any interference. "You'll be there, of course, you'll be able to persuade her more than I."  
“好吧，我想可以。但你得让我来。”她边说边在脑海中构思计划，不希望有任何干扰。“你当然会在场，你能说服她的程度比我强得多。”  
  
  
  
"Thank you, that means a lot to me." He repeated. "It's almost time for class, we should go back... I erm... I really liked eating with you today." He said as he picked up their bentos before getting up.  
“谢谢你，这对我意义重大。”他重复道。“快上课了，我们该回去了……呃……我真的很喜欢今天和你一起吃饭。”他说着，拿起他们的便当盒，站起身来。  
  
  
  
"I had a good time too. You're not so bad, Third Child." She said with a smile.  
“我也很开心。你其实不错，三少爷。”她微笑着说。  
  
  
  
"M-maybe we could eat together again... with Hikari and... T-Toji and Kensuke, so we wouldn't attract too much attention..."  
“也许我们可以再次一起吃饭...和光、...和真嗣、还有剑介，这样就不会太引人注目了...”  
  
  
  
"Ugh ! Being seen with the Stooges would ruin my reputation here ! I have an excuse with you since you're a pilot too. You've already asked a lot of me, Third Child !" She said with a scowl. Then her features softened when she thought about eating with said Third Child on a regular basis. " But I'll think about it."  
“呃！和那帮家伙一起出现会毁了我的名声！我和你一起还有个借口，毕竟你也是驾驶员。你已经让我做了很多了，第三适格者！”她皱着眉说。但想到能经常和这位第三适格者一起吃饭，她的表情又缓和了下来。“不过我会考虑的。”  
  
  
  
They walked back to their classroom quietly. Shinji looked down and his shoulders were slumped. He got back in character quickly so nobody would ask him questions. Or more precisely so he would have an excuse not to answer them when they would ask questions. Asuka strutted with her usual haughty demeanor for the same reasons. Both of them were gleeful inside, happy to have settled things down and looking forward to spending the night in each other's arms.  
他们默默地走回教室。真嗣低着头，肩膀下垂。他很快恢复了常态，以免有人问他问题。更确切地说，是为了在他们问问题时有个借口不回答。明日香则一如既往地昂首阔步，出于同样的原因保持着她那傲慢的态度。两人内心都充满了喜悦，高兴地解决了问题，并期待着晚上能相拥而眠。

### Chapter 6 : Lord I've been changed

Hey !  
  
Here's a new chapter. That one was really tricky to write ! Enjoy. If you want I mean !  
这是新的一章。写这一章真的很有挑战性！尽情享受吧。我是说，如果你愿意的话！  
  
"Pilot Soryu, thank you for allowing us to ask you a few questions."  
“相叶机长，感谢您允许我们向您提几个问题。”  
  
Asuka wasn't very pleased to say the least to have to answer to this "Committee" she had never heard of before. Misato had told her and Shinji that they were both going to be questioned concerning what happened during the Angel battle, that she had tried to prevent this but that they didn't take "no" for an answer. She was annoyed and tense, but tried to hide it as much as she could. The fact that she was standing in a room only lit by a projector under her didn't help. So she stood there in her plugsuit, her arms crossed and her head slightly tilted, the light from under her unpleasant for her eyes. "I don't think I can give you much information." She answered with as little inflection as possible.  
至少可以说，明日香对不得不向这个她之前从未听说过的“委员会”汇报感到非常不悦。美里告诉她和真嗣，他们俩都将就天使战斗期间发生的事情接受质询，她曾试图阻止这一切，但他们不接受“不”作为回答。她感到烦躁和紧张，但尽量隐藏起来。房间里只有投影仪的光线，从她脚下照射上来，这让她更加不自在。于是她站在插入栓服里，双臂交叉，头微微倾斜，脚下的光线让她的眼睛感到不适。“我想我无法提供太多信息。”她尽可能平淡地回答。  
  
"Did the Angel attempt to communicate with you ?" A second voice which came from nowhere and everywhere at the same time asked.  
“天使是否试图与你沟通？”一个来自四面八方的声音同时问道。  
  
"How should I know ? As I already said in my report, I was asleep most of the time and barely conscious otherwise ! I might have had some dreams or nightmares but I don't remember them." The vision of her own face that she saw inside the Angel flashed through her mind.  
“我怎么知道？正如我在报告中已经说过的，我大部分时间都在睡觉，其他时候也只是勉强清醒！我可能做了一些梦或噩梦，但我记不清了。”天使内部她自己的脸庞在她脑海中闪过。  
  
"That is, if your memory is correct."  
“也就是说，如果你的记忆准确的话。”  
  
"And how would I know if my memory had been tampered with ?" She said sarcastically.  
“那我怎么知道我的记忆有没有被篡改呢？”她讽刺地说。  
  
"Was the Angel interested in your spirit ? In your mind ?" The first voice asked.  
“天使对你的灵魂感兴趣吗？对你的心灵呢？”第一个声音问道。  
  
"When I was inside the Angel, everything was white and empty. There was nothing. If the Angel manifested itself maybe I would have talked to it to occupy my time." She had less and less success hiding her annoyance to these faceless voices. "All I know is that I almost died inside my Eva so I was preoccupied with other things rather than analyzing Gott knows what !"  
“当我身处 EVA 内部时，四周一片空白，什么都没有。如果 EVA 能显现出什么，或许我会和它聊聊天来打发时间。”她越来越难以掩饰对这些匿名声音的恼怒。“我只知道我在 EVA 里差点丧命，所以我忙着其他事情，而不是去分析上帝才知道什么！”  
  
"That will be all. You are dismissed." A new voice stated. This one was calm and deep, it irradiated an aura of authority. Asuka's anger vanished in an instant upon hearing it.  
“就这样吧。你可以离开了。”一个新的声音说道。这个声音平静而深沉，散发着权威的气息。听到这个声音，明日香瞬间消散了怒气。  
  
"Yes, Sir." She answered, before the light under her disappeared.  
“是，长官。”她回答道，随后脚下的灯光消失了。  
  
"What do you think, Ikari ?" The same voice added.  
“你怎么看，碇？”同一个声音补充道。  
  
"The informations we got from the Second Child are inconclusive. She is far too unreliable to tell us anything useful. Bring the Third." Commander Ikari stated emotionless as the light under him turned on. He disappeared back in the darkness as soon as he finished his sentence.  
“我们从二号适格者那里得到的情报并不确切。她太不可靠，无法提供任何有用的信息。把三号带来。”碇司令面无表情地说道，随即他脚下的灯光亮起。话音刚落，他又消失在了黑暗中。  
  
"We should try something different with him." A fourth voice stated. It sounded old, or rather older than the others. The light brought the attention of the Committee to the Third Child, who was clad in his plugsuit as well. He looked uncomfortable and scared.  
“我们应该对他采取不同的策略。”第四个声音说道。听起来比其他人更年长。灯光吸引了委员会的注意，他们转向了身着插入栓服的三号适格者。他看起来既不自在又害怕。  
  
"Don't worry." The fourth voice said. "Just tell us what happened during your time inside the last Angel. Tell us anything that you think could be relevant to understand our enemy better." It added calmly, almost with a friendly tone to it.  
“别担心。”第四个声音说道。“只需告诉我们你在最后一个使徒内部时发生了什么。告诉我们任何你认为可能有助于更好地了解我们敌人的信息。”它平静地补充道，几乎带着友好的语气。  
  
"Erm... Well... I don't really know... There... There was nothing, and nothing happened." Shinji was very nervous, talking like this with invisible interlocutors. The whole staging for this interview made him anxious. Even the fact that he had to wear his plugsuit made him nervous.  
“呃……嗯……我真的不知道……那里……什么都没有，什么也没发生。”真嗣非常紧张，这样和看不见的对话者交谈。这次采访的整个场景让他感到焦虑。甚至他不得不穿上插入栓服也让他紧张。  
  
"Do you think the Angel tried to communicate with you at some point ?" The first voice which spoke to Asuka asked. Its tone was calm too, but it betrayed some anticipation. Some impatience.  
“你认为使徒在某个时刻试图与你沟通吗？”第一个向明日香提问的声音问道。它的语气也很平静，但透露出一些期待。有些不耐烦。  
  
"I erm... Don't think so. I've dreamed that I had a conversation with myself." He was embarrassed by the conversation, he hadn't told anyone about it, not even Asuka, and he sure didn't want to tell people he didn't even know what this conversation was about. Not to mention that telling them that it was seeing Asuka that triggered, according to him, the Eva going berserk. "I... Don't remember the conversation. After that, I woke up and the Eva took control and destroyed the Angel. I passed out so I don't know what happened. I'm Sorry."  
“呃...我不这么认为。我梦到过自己和自己在对话。”他因这场对话而感到尴尬，他从未向任何人透露过这件事，甚至没有告诉明日香，更不用说他根本不知道这场对话的内容。更别提告诉他们，正是看到明日香才触发了，据他所称，使 Eva 失控的原因。“我...不记得那段对话了。之后，我醒来，Eva 接管了控制权并摧毁了使徒。我昏过去了，所以不知道发生了什么。对不起。”  
  
"According to the partial recording we managed to recover, you activated your Evangelion consciously moments before it took control." Said the first voice.  
“根据我们设法恢复的部分录音，你在 Eva 失控前一刻是有意识地激活了它。”第一个声音说道。  
  
"I panicked. I woke up thinking I was going to die. I didn't want to die." Shinji said with despair.  
“我慌了。醒来时以为自己要死了。我不想死。”真嗣绝望地说。  
  
"That'll be enough. You're dismissed." The third voice said, understanding that they wouldn't get anymore useful informations from the Third Child, before the light went out under Shinji, and the one under his father turned on.  
“够了。你可以走了。”第三把声音说道，意识到无法从第三适格者那里获取更多有用信息，随后真嗣脚下的灯光熄灭，而他父亲脚下的灯光亮起。  
  
"The Angels appear to be getting more and more intelligent. There's not much time left." Gendo said without even moving, his fingers crossed in front of his mouth.  
“使徒似乎变得越来越聪明了。我们剩下的时间不多了。”源渡不动声色地说道，手指交叉在嘴前。  
  
"Left for us, you mean ?" The third voice, the voice of Keel Lorenz, asked rhetorically.  
“你是说，对我们而言？”第三把声音，即基尔·洛伦兹的声音，反问道。  
  
.  
  
.  
  
The silence was heavy in the Alpine that was bringing the trio back to their home. They all were preoccupied by what happened with the Committee. Misato still felt guilty for putting her kids through it. As a consequence, she decided that she had caught up enough on her paperwork to allow herself some time off so she could spend more time with her wards, to give them some semblance of a normal life.  
阿尔卑斯山脉的寂静沉重，正载着三人返回他们的家。他们都沉浸在委员会事件的思绪中。美里仍为自己让孩子们经历这一切感到内疚。因此，她决定自己的文书工作已经足够，可以给自己放个假，以便花更多时间陪伴她的孩子们，给他们一些正常生活的模样。  
  
When they arrived home, She grabbed herself a beer that she savored, for once, after having changed in her usual tank top and mini shorts. Asuka went straight to the bathroom to take a shower and Shinji started making dinner. The interviews didn't last long for both Pilots, but they made them wait a long time before going through with it.  
当他们回到家，她给自己拿了瓶啤酒，难得地细细品味，换上了她惯常的背心和迷你短裤。明日香径直去洗澡，而真嗣开始准备晚餐。两位驾驶员的采访并没有持续很久，但让他们等待了很长时间才进行。  
  
When Asuka came out of the bathroom, wearing only a towel around her body and another around her hair, the first thing she did was scream at Shinji and scold him because dinner wasn't ready yet. She really enjoyed this. She could scream at him to her heart's content and she knew it was consequence free, since he was one of the only ones she had shown the real Asuka, even if it was just a glimpse. She just hoped he knew, because she couldn't bring herself to tell him what she had said to herself in her Entry-plug yet, she had already enough of a hard time accepting it herself.  
当明日香从浴室出来，身上只裹着一条浴巾，头发也用另一条包着时，她做的第一件事就是对着真嗣尖叫，责怪他晚饭还没准备好。她真的很享受这个过程。她可以尽情地对他大吼大叫，而且知道这不会有任何后果，因为他是唯一几个她展示过真实自我的对象之一，尽管只是短暂的一瞥。她只是希望他明白，因为她还无法鼓起勇气告诉他自己在插入栓里对自己说过的话，她自己都还在艰难地接受这一点。  
  
The mood improved significantly as dinner went on. All three of them were more than happy to release some steam. The last few nights had taken a toll on them, and they had needed this, consequently, none of them did anything to darken the mood, Asuka didn't shout as much as before dinner, and Shinji kept quiet in order not to apologize. It was the best option in his mind, and he felt content just listening to his two roommates talking about nothing in particular. The only thing that kept him from truly relaxing was the slight smirk that Asuka wore. He knew from experience that this facial expression meant that she had something in mind.  
随着晚餐的进行，气氛明显好转。三人都乐意释放一些压力。过去几个夜晚对他们造成了影响，他们确实需要这样放松，因此没有人试图破坏气氛。与晚餐前相比，明日香不再那么大声嚷嚷，而真嗣则保持沉默，以免再次道歉。在他看来，这是最佳选择，他感到满足，只需聆听两位室友随意的闲聊。唯一让他无法完全放松的是明日香嘴角那抹微妙的笑意。他凭经验知道，这种表情意味着她心里有事。  
  
And he was right. When he stood up and picked up their plates to do the dishes, he threw a nervous glare in her direction, which she noticed, but ignored. Even if she could have, she didn't want to let this opportunity go to waste. The moment was perfect. The pieces were set. The plan was in motion. 'Oh he wants Misato to know ? Fine ! But it will be on my own terms.' Her plan was foolproof. Simple, yet elegant... Well, mostly.  
他的猜测没错。当他起身收拾盘子准备洗碗时，他向她投去紧张的一瞥，她注意到了，却置之不理。即使她本可以，她也不想错过这个机会。时机恰到好处。棋子已布好。计划正在实施。'哦，他想让美里知道？好吧！但得按我的条件来。'她的计划天衣无缝。简单而优雅……嗯，基本上是。  
  
"Hey Shin-Chan~ !" A very tipsy and very cheerful Misato called. "You shouldn't push yourself this hard ! You don't have to clean everything right away ! Come back with us !" She said with her cutest voice.  
"嘿，真嗣~！" 喝得醉醺醺且异常开心的美里喊道。"你不必这么拼命！不用立刻打扫干净！跟我们一起回去吧！" 她用最可爱的声音说道。  
  
"Don't you dare, Invincible Shinji." Asuka replied. Her tone was a mix between joking and threatening which made shivers run down Shinji's spine. "I don't want to live in a slum ! And I know what's going to happen if you start listening to Misato !"  
"你敢，无敌的真嗣。" 明日香回答道。她的语气介于玩笑和威胁之间，让真嗣脊背发凉。"我不想住在贫民窟里！而且我知道如果你开始听美里的话会发生什么！"  
  
"I'll be done in a minute anyway." He answered, defeated.  
"反正我马上就弄完了。" 他无奈地回答。  
  
"You're no fun." Misato pouted before consoling herself with her beer.  
“你真没趣。”美里噘嘴抱怨，随即用啤酒安慰自己。  
  
'GO !' Asuka thought. "By the way, Misato..." She paused for effect and was satisfied to see that her guardian kept drinking her beer while her eyes turned to her. "Shinji and I have been sleeping together for the past week or so." She continued casually.  
“去吧！”明日香心想。“对了，美里……”她故意停顿以增加效果，满意地看到她的监护人一边继续喝着啤酒，一边将目光转向她。“真嗣和我已经一起睡了大约一个星期了。”她随意地继续说道。  
  
And everything went exactly according to plan. Misato spat the beer that was still in her mouth and choked on the liquid that was in her throat. She started coughing. She was turning red, tears forming in her eyes, beer shooting out of her nostrils. Shinji, for his part, was paralyzed like a deer in headlight, as red as Misato, but for different reasons. He was still holding his sponge in his right hand but had dropped the plate he was cleaning.  
一切正如计划中那样进行。美里将口中尚未咽下的啤酒喷了出来，呛到了喉咙里的液体，开始剧烈咳嗽。她的脸涨得通红，泪水在眼眶中打转，啤酒从鼻孔中喷出。真嗣则像被车灯照到的鹿一样僵住了，脸红得和美里一样，但原因不同。他右手还拿着海绵，但原本在清洗的盘子已经掉落在地。  
  
Asuka wiped some beer from her face with a napkin, a small price to pay, she thought, as she continued. "What's happening to you ? Are you okay ?" She asked innocently. "Oh ! You thought we are actually sleeping together as in... Sleeping together ?" She said in mock-surprise. "Don't be silly ! I just mean that we both sleep in the same bed, nothing more !"  
明日香用纸巾擦去脸上的啤酒，她觉得这只是个小代价，继续说道。“你怎么了？还好吗？”她天真地问道。“哦！你以为我们真的在……睡在一起？”她故作惊讶地说。“别傻了！我只是说我们俩睡在同一张床上，仅此而已！”  
  
Misato tried to look angry when she finally stopped coughing, but the effect was somewhat lost on the girl in front of her.  
美里试图在终于停止咳嗽后显得生气，但这种效果在面前的女孩身上有些失效。  
  
"Oh come on ! You've been teasing us non stop since I moved in here ! You can't act like that now !" Asuka replied to the unspoken remark, still with a smirk on her face.  
“哦，拜托！自从我搬进来，你就一直在逗我们！现在不能这样装傻了！”明日香回应着那未说出口的话，脸上依然带着一丝笑意。  
  
"I'm not talking about that !" Misato shot out with a hoarse voice, her face stern, her tone almost menacing.  
“我不是在说那个！” 美里沙哑着嗓子喊道，脸色严峻，语气几乎带有威胁。  
  
"What do..." She was cut by her Major.  
“什么……” 她被她的少校打断了。  
  
"You're far too young to be doing this." She said. Her tipsy and friendly demeanor gone in an instant. It's at this precise moment that Pen Pen decided to make a strategic retreat to his fridge. "You think the both of you can do what the hell you want ? I can't believe it. You two are completely irresponsible." She continued, her voice was calm but everyone in the room could see that she wasn't. "We are at war. We cannot afford to jeopardize the survival of mankind because two kids cannot stop making doe eyes at each other."  
“你太年轻了，不适合做这个。” 她说道。她那醉醺醺的友好态度瞬间消失。就在这一刻，Pen Pen 决定战略性地撤退到他的冰箱。“你们俩以为可以随心所欲吗？我简直不敢相信。你们两个完全不负责任。” 她继续说道，声音平静，但房间里的每个人都能看出她并非如此。“我们正处于战争中。我们不能因为两个孩子无法停止互相眉来眼去就危及人类的生存。”  
  
"Then maybe you shouldn't have made me move in with you !" Asuka was furious. She slammed her palms against the table as she stood up, knocking her chair down in the process. "I warned you Misato ! I told you when _you_ made me move in that it was a bad idea ! But you didn't listen, did you ? All of us knew right from the start that something like this could happen ! And now you want to separate us because you don't want to face the consequences of _your_ actions !"  
“那也许你就不该让我搬来和你住！”明日香怒不可遏。她站起身来，双手猛击桌子，过程中将椅子撞倒了。“我警告过你，美里！我搬进来时就说这是个馊主意！可你没听，对吧？我们一开始就知道可能会发生这种事！现在你却想把我们分开，因为你不想面对自己行为的后果！”  
  
"I guess you're right. I should never have allowed two irresponsible teenagers to live together, but for someone who keeps heralding how mature you are, you really did make a point in proving that these are just empty words !" Misato stood up as well. Disappointment could be heard in every word she said. "I can't let you two live together anymore... I can't trust you."  
“我想你是对的。我本不该让两个不负责任的青少年住在一起，但对你这种总是标榜自己有多成熟的人，你确实证明了这些只是空话！”美里也站了起来。她说的每一个字都透露出失望。“我不能再让你们两个住在一起了……我无法信任你们。”  
  
"You can't do that Misato-San !" Shinji said pleadingly but with determination while coming close to Asuka, drawing strength from her closeness and encouraging her at the same time. "Asuka didn't want you to know." He said with conviction which earned him a look of anger from Asuka and made Misato's stance falter a little. "It was my idea. Because I thought you of all people would understand. Because I thought we could trust you. That it would make you happy..." he trailed off.  
"Misato 小姐，你不能这么做！" 真嗣恳求地说，但语气坚定，他靠近明日香，从她的接近中汲取力量，同时也在鼓励她。"明日香不想让你知道。" 他坚定地说，这让明日香投来愤怒的目光，也让美里稍稍动摇了立场。"这是我的主意。因为我认为你是最能理解的人。因为我认为我们可以信任你。因为我认为这会让你开心..." 他话音渐弱。  
  
Shinji's remark really hurt her, but she hid it from them. She couldn't stop now. "I want to be happy for you... I really do... I know that both of you more than deserve as much happiness as you can get." She said in a more subdued tone. "But I just can't let you... As your guardian and especially as your commanding officer. There's just too much at stake. I'm sure you can understand that." She started walking around the table as she kept on justifying herself. "Imagine if you broke up. What would happen to your ability to pilot ? "She raised a hand towards Asuka. "Don't interrupt me !" She added with authority before continuing. "Or if one of you took unnecessary risks and got injured or even killed to protect the other ?.. I'm sorry but it's the human race's future we are talking about." She said in a despondent tone as she arrived just next to her charges...  
真嗣的话真的伤到了她，但她没有在他们面前表现出来。她不能就此罢休。“我希望你们幸福……我真的这么希望……我知道你们俩都值得拥有尽可能多的幸福。”她用更加低沉的语气说道。“但我就是不能让你们……作为你们的监护人，尤其是作为你们的指挥官。风险实在太大了。我相信你们能理解。”她一边绕着桌子走，一边继续为自己辩解。“想象一下，如果你们分手了。你们的驾驶能力会怎样？”她向明日香伸出手。“别打断我！”她带着权威的语气补充道，然后继续说。“或者如果你们中的一个为了保护对方而冒不必要的风险，受伤甚至丧命呢？……我很抱歉，但我们谈论的是人类的未来。”她用沮丧的语气说道，当她走到她的两个被监护人旁边时……  
  
… And swiftly took them both into a crushing bear hug ! Shinji yelped and almost fainted. Asuka gasped as the air was pushed out of her lungs. They both struggled against their assailant before understanding that it was a lost cause. Misato was laughing while holding them in an unconventional group hug.  
……并迅速将他们俩紧紧地拥入怀中！真嗣惊叫一声，差点晕过去。明日香喘不过气来，因为空气被挤出了她的肺部。他们俩都挣扎着反抗袭击者，但很快就明白这是徒劳的。美里一边笑着，一边用一种非传统的拥抱方式抱着他们。  
  
"What the hell are you doing !?" Asuka asked, she was still very much angry at Misato and didn't quite understand what was happening.  
“你到底在搞什么鬼？！”明日香问道，她对美里仍然非常生气，不太明白发生了什么。  
  
"Are you dense ?" Misato teased. "Of course I'm happy for you guys !.. But never try to fool me again." She said mock-menacingly as she released them from her iron grip.  
“你是傻吗？”美里打趣道，“当然我为你们高兴！……但别再想骗我了。”她半开玩笑地威胁着，同时松开了他们。  
  
"Y-You mean you won't..." Shinji tried to ask.  
“你-你的意思是……”真嗣试图询问。  
  
"Of course I won't separate you ! You two lovebirds are too adorable together for that !" She answered cheerfully.  
“当然不会分开你们！你们这对小情侣在一起太可爱了！”她愉快地回答道。  
  
"So you're going to tease us even more. You had a great idea there, Baka Shinji."  
“所以你还要继续取笑我们。真是个好主意，笨蛋真嗣。”  
  
"T-Thank you, Misato-San" Shinji finally managed to regain enough composure to make a full sentence.  
“谢谢您，美里小姐。”真嗣终于恢复了足够的镇定，能够完整地说出一句话。  
  
"You're the only one who knows about us. Well, you and Pen Pen, of course. And we intend on keeping it that way, so don't tell anyone, alright ?" Asuka demanded. She was relieved that everything went well, but that didn't mean they didn't have things to settle.  
“你是唯一知道我们关系的人。当然，还有 Pen Pen。我们打算保持这样，所以别告诉任何人，好吗？”明日香要求道。她松了一口气，一切顺利，但这并不意味着他们没有事情要解决。  
  
"I'm glad you trust me enough to tell me this. Trust me, I won't tell anyone, but you guys have to be careful too, okay ? You have Section 2 agents following you pretty much everywhere, and I'm pretty sure _some_ people wouldn't be too happy to know about you two being together."  
“我很高兴你足够信任我，告诉我这些。相信我，我不会告诉任何人，但你们也得小心，好吗？第二支部的人几乎无处不在地跟踪你们，我敢肯定有些人不会乐意知道你们俩在一起。”  
  
Asuka grimaced a little at this last word. They hadn't decided if they indeed were together. They probably were, but they, or she, didn't want to put a label on them yet. She was an independent woman. She didn't need anyone. She didn't want to lose this. "We already know that. By the way, it would be nice to have a little bit more freedom. I haven't forgotten Okinawa, you know."  
听到这个词，明日香微微皱眉。他们还没决定是否真的在一起。可能确实如此，但他们，或者说她，还不愿意给他们贴上标签。她是个独立的女人。她不需要任何人。她不想失去这一点。“我们已经知道了。顺便说一句，能多一点自由就好了。我没忘记冲绳的事。”  
  
Misato gave her an apologetic look. "You have to be even more careful because now my ass in on the line as well ! I will get fired if anyone learns that I hid this information !"  
美里给了她一个抱歉的眼神。“你现在得更小心了，因为我的屁股也悬在线上！如果有人发现我隐瞒了这些信息，我就会被炒鱿鱼！”  
  
"Maybe it would be better for everyone involved." Asuka answered sarcastically.  
“也许这对大家都更好。”明日香讽刺地回答。  
  
"I know you don't really think that !" She hugged them again, this time less forcefully. They both returned the hug after some awkward seconds. "I'm so happy for you !" She freed them. " I'm going to bed, don't be too loud tonight, lovebirds !"  
“我知道你并不是真的那么想！”她再次拥抱了他们，这次力度小了一些。两人在尴尬的几秒钟后也回抱了她。“我真为你们高兴！”她松开了他们。“我要去睡觉了，今晚别太吵，小情侣！”  
  
"Misato !" Both Children blushed and shouted at the same time. But Misato was already out of the dining room and almost at her bedroom. They looked at each other, shrugged, then went to the bathroom to brush their teeth. They got even redder when they realized it was just like during their sync training. They then went to their room in silence.  
“美里！”两个孩子同时脸红并大喊。但美里已经离开了餐厅，几乎到了她的卧室。他们互相看了一眼，耸了耸肩，然后去浴室刷牙。当他们意识到这就像同步训练时一样，脸变得更红了。然后他们默默地回到自己的房间。

The light of the setting sun made the depiction of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life in the scarcely furnished office glimmer eerily.  
落日的余晖让这间陈设稀少的办公室里描绘的卡巴拉生命之树图样显得阴森地闪烁。  
  
"This is a development we did not foresee." Fuyutsuki stated, breaking the silence after what had seemed like hours to him. Maybe it had been.  
“这是我们未曾预料到的发展。”冬月说道，打破了似乎对他来说像几个小时一样的沉默。也许确实如此。  
  
"If development it is.." Gendo answered." There is nothing concrete as of right now." The last thing they had listened to was the audio recording of the last fight, before the two Evangelions were swallowed by the Shadow.  
“如果是发展的话……” 碇源堂回答道。“目前还没有确切的消息。” 他们最后听到的是最后一次战斗的录音，在那之前，两台 EVA 被阴影吞噬了。  
  
"This could endanger the scenario." Fuyutsuki had learned over the years how to talk to his superior in order to coax informations from him.. Gendo still kept his secrets, of course, but the Professor had managed to get informations he should not have known thanks to this skill he had developed.  
“这可能会危及计划。” 多年来，冬月学会了如何与他的上司交谈，以便从他那里套取信息。碇源堂当然仍然保守着他的秘密，但教授凭借这项技能，设法获取了他本不该知道的信息。  
  
"As I said, we do not have anything concrete. I will have Rei gather informations on them. We are not going to take measures, especially since it could prove beneficial to the scenario." Gendo replied in his usual deadpan tone.  
“正如我所说，我们没有任何确切的东西。我会让绫波收集他们的信息。我们不会采取措施，特别是这可能对计划有利。” 碇源堂以他一贯的平淡语气回答道。  
  
"How is that ?"  
“怎么会这样？”  
  
""We did not have any use for the Second anymore. Now, we might be able to use her to "motivate" the Third. You have seen how he reacted when he encountered Rei. He can easily be manipulated. If he is infatuated with the Second, this will be even easier... And if the need shall arise, we can use more persuasive measures." Gendo crossed his fingers before his mouth as he finished his sentence.  
“我们已经不再需要二号了。现在，我们可以利用她来‘激励’三号。你见过他遇到绫波时的反应，他很容易被操控。如果他对二号着迷，这将更加容易……而如果必要时，我们可以采取更强制的手段。” 碇源堂交叉手指放在嘴前，结束了他的话。  
  
"Are you saying.." Fuyutsuki was cut before he could finish his question.  
“你是说……” 还没等冬月说完，他的问题就被打断了。  
  
"Yes. Furthermore, it might be just what we would need t use him as a contingency in case Rei was to become... Unreliable." Gendo stated.  
“是的。此外，这或许正是我们需要将他作为备用方案的原因，以防丽变得……不可靠。”碇源堂说道。  
  
Fuyutsuki could have kept the conversation going, yet his thoughts prevented him from doing so. 'Yui would have never accepted you using _her_ son like this. Will you be able to look her in the eyes after this ?' His thoughts were interrupted by his phone ringing.  
冬月本可以继续对话，但他的思绪阻止了他这样做。‘唯绝不会接受你这样利用她的儿子。你这样做后，还能直视她的眼睛吗？’他的思绪被响起的电话打断。  
  
"What ?" He answered sternly.  
“什么事？”他严肃地接起电话。  
  
A hesitant and shaky voice answered the question. "The... The Second Branch Sir, it disappeared."  
一个犹豫而颤抖的声音回答了问题。“第……第二分部，它消失了。”  
  
"It disappeared ?! The entire Second Branch just vanished ?!" Fuyutsuki wasn't taken aback as much as he sounded. He only repeated the information for the other person in the room.  
“消失了？！整个第二分部就这么不见了？！”冬月并没有显得太过惊讶，他只是重复了这个信息，以便房间里的另一个人也能听到。  
  
"Yes, Sir, it's been confirmed. It's gone."  
“是的，先生，已经确认了。它不见了。”

.'Gott this had to be the worst idea this idiot ever had ! Asuka thought, and this time she decided to tell Shinji about it. She typed her message on her computer and sent it.  
.'天哪，这绝对是这白痴有史以来最糟糕的主意！' 明日香心想，这次她决定告诉真嗣。她在电脑上输入了信息并发送出去。  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_This has to be the worst idea you ever had, idiot._"  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷 : "这绝对是你有史以来最糟糕的主意，白痴。"  
  
Shinji I. : "_What ?_" Shinji cleverly replied.  
碇真嗣 : "什么？" 真嗣机智地回复道。  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_Me, Hikari, you and your Stooges._"  
惣流·Asuka·兰格雷：“我，光，你和你那帮跟班。”  
  
Shinji I : "_Sorry._"  
碇真嗣：“对不起。”  
  
Asuka L.S. :"_I'm going to punch you if this class ever ends._"  
惣流·Asuka·兰格雷：“这节课要是结束了，我非揍你不可。”  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_We can't just start this without a good reason._"  
惣流·A·明日香·兰格雷：“我们不能毫无理由地开始这件事。”  
  
Shinji I. : "_At least you're thinking about it, I'm glad._" It was easier for Shinji to be open on instant messaging. There was a rather long pause in their conversation. Shinji could hear Asuka typing, then stopping, then restarting a few times before he received a new message.  
碇真嗣：“至少你在考虑，我很高兴。”在即时通讯中，真嗣更容易敞开心扉。他们的对话中出现了一段相当长的停顿。真嗣能听到明日香在打字，然后停下来，又重新开始，几次之后他才收到新消息。  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_Okay. I admit. It's not that bad of an idea._"  
惣流·A·明日香·兰格雷：“好吧。我承认。这个主意没那么糟糕。”  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_It's just that we can't just tell them that it's NERV related. It might be enough for your idiot friends but Hikari would never buy it._"  
惣流·A·明日香·兰格雷：“只是我们不能直接告诉他们这是与 NERV 有关的事。这对你那些笨蛋朋友来说或许够了，但光是绝对不会相信的。”  
  
Shinji I. : "_You think the class rep will agree ?_"  
碇真嗣：“你觉得班长会同意吗？”  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_You just gave me a great idea ! Tell me you forgot our lunches today !_"  
惣流·A·明日香·兰格雷：“你刚刚给了我一个好主意！告诉我你今天忘了带午餐！”  
  
Shinji I. : "_You will scream at me ?_"  
碇真嗣：“你会对我尖叫吗？”  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_Oh yes ! But it's a small sacrifice, don't you think ?_"  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷：“哦，当然会！但这只是个小牺牲，你不觉得吗？”  
  
Shinji I. : "_I don't have a choice anyway. Please don't be too harsh._"  
碇真嗣：“反正我也没得选。请不要太严厉。”  
  
Asuka L.S. : "_You know me !_" She concluded with a smirk that he didn't see. Indeed, he knew her. He knew she was going to be harsh. Or he would soon find out.  
惣流·Asuka·兰格雷：“你了解我！”她带着一丝他未察觉的得意总结道。确实，他了解她。他知道她会严厉。或者他很快就会发现。  
  
The class went on forever in everyone's mind until finally, the bell rang, marking the beginning of lunch break.  
在所有人心中，这堂课似乎永无止境，直到终于，铃声响起，标志着午餐休息的开始。  
  
"Lunch time ! Lunch time ! This is the single best thing about school !" Toji exclaimed, his lecture-induced torpor already far behind him. Nothing could taint his good mood. Nothing except a high pitched shriek coming from a Demon. He turned in the direction of the parasitic noise just in time to see said Demon punching his friend rather hard on the shoulder. Shinji's cry of pain was drowned in Asuka's rambling.  
“午餐时间！午餐时间！这是学校唯一最好的事情！” 冬二兴奋地喊道，讲课带来的困倦早已被他抛诸脑后。没有什么能破坏他的好心情。除了一个恶魔发出的尖锐尖叫声。他转向寄生噪音的方向，正好看到那个恶魔狠狠地打了他朋友一拳在肩膀上。真嗣的痛苦呼喊被明日香的喋喋不休淹没了。  
  
"You didn't make lunches for us ?" She asked with all the anger she could muster. She knew that her lunch was safely packed in Shinji's bag, but she had to pass on it in order to move her plan forward.  
" “你没给我们准备午餐吗？”她竭尽全力地表现出愤怒。她知道自己的午餐安全地装在真嗣的包里，但她必须假装没有，以便推进她的计划。”  
  
"I didn't have time to cook last night. I had too much homework." Shinji managed to sound convincing. He used his disappointment to fuel his acting. He would have to eat the disgusting "food" of the cafeteria or skip lunch altogether  
" “昨晚我没时间做饭。作业太多了。”真嗣设法让自己听起来很可信。他利用自己的失望来增强演技。他要么得吃食堂那难以下咽的“食物”，要么干脆不吃午餐。”  
  
"And that's your excuse for me having to go without lunch ?!" She was about to drop the act and go rummage through Shinji's bag to get her lunch when she was interrupted by Toji.  
" “这就是你让我没午餐吃的借口吗？！”她正要放弃演戏，去真嗣的包里找自己的午餐，却被东治打断了。”  
  
"A husband and wife quarrel ?" Shinji and Asuka both blushed furiously at his comment. The other students around them started laughing and cheering as the both of them felt heat course through their bodies. They wanted nothing more than to disappear at this instant. The thought crossed both their minds that their secret had been discovered and that it was just a matter of time now before they would be separated.  
“夫妻吵架了？” 真嗣和明日香听到他的话，两人的脸都涨得通红。周围的其他学生开始哄笑和起哄，他们俩感到全身发热，恨不得立刻消失。两人心中都闪过一个念头：他们的秘密被发现了，分开只是时间问题。  
  
"It's not like that !" They regained their composure at the same time and shouted to Toji in unison.  
“不是那样的！” 他们同时恢复了镇定，异口同声地对冬二喊道。  
  
"Hikari, come with me !" Asuka demanded, and Hikari obliged. She hadn't been really angry when she had been screaming at Shinji, but Toji's snarky comment had put her in a bad mood. When they were far enough away from anyone, she spoke again. "I didn't want to be this hard on you."  
“光，跟我来！” 明日香命令道，光也顺从地跟上了。她之前对真嗣大吼时并没有真的生气，但冬二那句刻薄的话让她心情变差了。当她们远离人群后，她再次开口：“我不想对你这么严厉。”  
  
"Don't worry, I understand." Hikari replied. They went to a quiet place and sat down. "Do you want to share my lunch ? I always make too much anyway."  
“别担心，我明白。”光回答道。他们走到一个安静的地方坐下。“你想和我一起吃午饭吗？反正我总是做太多。”  
  
'I really don't deserve a friend like you.' Asuka thought before nodding. "Thank you !" She said with a smile. Hikari started eating as both of them fell silent again. After a while, Asuka broke the silence. "Hey, could I sleep at your place tonight ?"  
“我真的不配拥有你这样的朋友。”明日香心想，然后点头。“谢谢你！”她微笑着说。光开始吃饭，两人再次陷入沉默。过了一会儿，明日香打破了沉默。“嘿，我今晚能去你那儿睡吗？”  
  
"Uhm... Sure ! Of course ! But if you don't mind me asking, why ?" Hikari was surprised. Asuka had never been one to partake in this kind of activities. She was too mature for that, she always said.  
"“呃……当然可以！不过，如果你不介意我问的话，为什么呢？”光感到惊讶。明日香从未参与过这类活动。她总是说，她太成熟了，不适合这样。”  
  
"I spend far too much time with the idiot, Jock Stooge's joke earlier is proof of that. I need some time off from this wimp or else everyone is going to start believing we really are a married couple !" She answered, her eyes in the distance.  
“我和那个白痴待在一起的时间太长了，Jock Stooge 之前的笑话就是证明。我需要从这个软蛋身边抽离一段时间，否则大家都要开始相信我们真的是一对夫妻了！”她回答道，目光投向远方。  
  
'Everyone already believes that. You two are the only one who don't see it.' Hikari thought before giving her bento box to Asuka who quickly shoved as much food as she could in her mouth. "I already told you, you should be nicer to him." She said, a hint of annoyance in her voice. "And you could be nicer to Suzuhara too." She mumbled, almost inaudibly. Almost.  
"“大家早就这么认为了。只有你们俩看不出来。”光心想，然后把便当盒递给明日香，后者迅速往嘴里塞满了食物。“我早就告诉过你，你应该对他好一点。”她带着一丝不悦说道。“你也应该对铃原好一点。”她咕哝着，几乎听不见。几乎。”  
  
She didn't want to talk about Shinji, maybe tonight she would but for now, she was glad to have an opportunity to end this conversation. "And why should I be nicer to Suzuhara ?" She asked in a mellow tone.  
她不想谈论真嗣，也许今晚她会的，但此刻，她很高兴有机会结束这场对话。“我为什么要对铃原好一点？”她用柔和的语气问道。  
  
"No reason !" Hikari yelped as she turned beet red, then fell silent.  
“没理由！”光莉尖叫道，脸红得像甜菜根，随后陷入了沉默。  
  
"I'll have to go back home to pick some stuff up, I'll come to your house after okay ?" Asuka stated, relieved to have dodged that bullet.  
“我得回家拿些东西，之后去你家好吗？”明日香说道，庆幸自己躲过了那一劫。  
  
"I... Yeah. Okay !" She still wasn't over the shock brought by Asuka's incredible hearing.  
“我... 嗯。好的！”她仍未从明日香惊人的听力带来的震惊中恢复过来。  
  
.  
  
.  
  
When the bell marking the end of the day rang, every student in classroom 2-A sighed with relief. They all packed their bags and left the classroom in record time, except for four of them. As Asuka finally informed Shinji that she was spending the night at Hikari's, much to his disappointment, Hikari herself went to speak to Toji. Asuka gave Shinji a reassuring, albeit discreet smile and whispered to him "Come on, you can handle sleeping alone for one night, right ?" He nodded slightly, with a smile tainted with a little sadness. Asuka then turned on her heels and left the classroom on her own.  
当标志着一天结束的铃声响起时，2-A 教室里的每个学生都松了一口气。他们迅速收拾好书包，以创纪录的速度离开了教室，除了四个人。当明日香终于告诉真嗣她要在光家里过夜时，真嗣感到有些失望，而光自己则去找了阿薰。明日香给了真嗣一个安慰的、尽管是隐晦的微笑，并低声对他说：“来吧，你一个人睡一晚没问题的，对吧？”他微微点头，带着一丝忧伤的微笑。明日香随即转身，独自离开了教室。  
  
"Suzuhara, you've got the duty this week. Get to work !" Hikari said with her usual authority.  
“铃原，这周轮到你值日了。快去干活！”光用她一贯的权威语气说道。  
  
"What do you mean ?" Toji answered, looking confused.  
“你什么意思？”阿薰回答，看起来很困惑。  
  
"The class printout ! Didn't you hear the teacher tell you to deliver this ?"  
“班级打印件！你没听到老师让你送这个吗？”  
  
"Come on, you can ask the other person on duty, can't you ?" Toji replied, clearly showing how unwilling he was.  
“拜托，你不能让其他值班的人帮忙吗？”冬二回答道，明显表现出他的不情愿。  
  
"Miss Ayanami is absent today !" Hikari's behavior hadn't changed.  
“绫波同学今天缺席了！”光子的行为没有变化。  
  
"Ayanami and me ? Then I guess there's no choice. But I don't want to go to some girl's place by myself." Toji said as he saw an opportunity to make this chore less boring.  
“绫波和我？那看来没得选了。但我不想一个人去女生家里。” 当看到有机会让这差事不那么无聊时，真嗣说道。  
  
Hikari saw an opportunity as well and decided to go with it. Sure, it would mean making Asuka wait, but she would understand. She would probably go on and on about how stupid Toji was, but she would understand. "Well, I can go with you..."  
光也看到了机会，决定抓住它。当然，这意味着要让明日香等待，但她会理解的。她可能会没完没了地说真嗣有多蠢，但她会理解的。“好吧，我可以和你一起去……”  
  
But her hopes vanished when Toji shouted. "Shinji ! Walk home with me, will you ?"  
但她的希望在真嗣大喊时破灭了。“真嗣！和我一起走回家，好吗？”  
  
.  
  
.  
  
Unfortunately for Toji, the walk to Rei's apartment didn't offer much in the way of entertainment. Shinji didn't seem to be in a talking mood, even less than usual. He seemed to be pondering something. When they arrived at Rei's front door, Toji refrained from commenting on it. Or on her building. Or on her neighborhood for that matter. He knew that it was a sketchy neighborhood to say the least, but he hadn't witnessed how dilapidated it looked with his own eyes. Every building there seemed about to crumble. Everything was dirty and full of rubble.  
遗憾的是，对于冬二来说，前往丽公寓的这段路程并没有提供多少娱乐。真嗣似乎没有心情聊天，比平时还要沉默。他似乎在思考着什么。当他们到达丽家门口时，冬二忍住了对门的评论，也没有对她的楼房或社区发表意见。他知道这个社区至少可以说是有点破旧，但他从未亲眼见过这里有多么的破败。那里的每一栋建筑似乎都摇摇欲坠。到处都是脏乱和碎石。  
  
"Ayanami, we're coming in." Shinji stated after they had stayed for some time in front of the door.  
"绫波，我们进来了。" 他们在门前站了一会儿后，真嗣说道。  
  
"You can't enter a girl's room without her permission." Toji retorted with evident shock in his voice.  
"未经允许，你不能进入女孩子的房间。" 冬二带着明显的震惊反驳道。  
  
"We've got no choice. She won't see it if we leave it there." Shinji said while gesturing at the mailbox. He then opened the door when he finished his sentence. "Excuse us..." When he didn't get an answer, he entered, took off his shoes and headed inside the main room, followed closely by Toji.  
“我们别无选择。如果我们把信放在那里，她不会看到的。” 真嗣一边说一边指着邮箱。说完后，他打开了门。“打扰一下……” 见无人应答，他便走了进去，脱下鞋子，跟着走进了主房间，东治紧随其后。  
  
"Good grief ! This is a girl's room ? It's so decrepit." Toji said in an astounded tone.  
“天哪！这是女孩子的房间吗？这么破旧。” 东治用惊讶的语气说道。  
  
Shinji didn't fail to notice that the upper drawer of Rei's dresser was slightly ajar. He shook the memory out of his mind and went to the bed, where he placed the printouts. After that, he knelt down and started picking up dirty rags from the floor.  
真嗣没有忽略丽梳妆台上层抽屉微微敞开的事实。他摇了摇头，抛开这些记忆，走到床边，把打印件放下。随后，他跪下来开始从地板上捡起脏布。  
  
"Hey, you shouldn't touch anything ! She'll get pissed !" Toji said in a warning tone when he saw what his friend was doing.  
“嘿，你不该乱碰东西！她会生气的！”当看到朋友的行为时，冬二用警告的语气说道。  
  
"I'm just cleaning up."  
“我只是打扫一下。”  
  
"I won't help you ! That's not a man's job !"  
“我可不帮你！这不是男人该干的活！”  
  
"Okay, but Misato hates guys like that." Shinji answered sardonically. He hadn't asked for any help, but it was too easy to pass up.  
“好吧，但美里讨厌那种人。”真嗣讽刺地回答。他并没有请求帮助，但这机会太诱人了，不容错过。  
  
Toji gasped. "I don't care ! It's my policy !" He obviously was flustered.  
剑介倒吸一口气。“我不在乎！这是我的原则！”他显然慌了神。  
  
Shinji picked up his garbage bag and headed for another pile of rags. Toji sat down on a chair, still watching him, still not helping him.  
真嗣拿起垃圾袋，走向另一堆破布。剑介坐在椅子上，依旧盯着他，依旧没有帮忙。  
  
"Come to think of it, you've changed."  
"仔细想想，你变了。"  
  
"What ?" Shinji didn't seem to pay attention, or he really hadn't understood.  
"什么？" 真嗣似乎没在听，或者他真的没听懂。  
  
"You, Shinji." Toji clarified as Shinji turned to face him "The first time I saw you, I really thought you were a jerk. You didn't seem like you would do something for someone else." He paused, then his eyes went to the ceiling. "I guess you're just really reserved."  
"你，真嗣。" トウジ解释道，当真嗣转过身面对他时，"我第一次见到你时，我真的以为你是个混蛋。你看起来不像会为别人做什么事。" 他顿了顿，然后目光转向天花板，"我想你只是真的很内向。"  
  
Shinji pondered this comment for a few seconds. "I guess opening up to others can lead to good things." Their conversation was interrupted when Rei entered her apartment.  
真嗣对这个评论沉思了几秒钟。“我想向他人敞开心扉可能会带来好事。”他们的对话被丽进入她的公寓打断了。  
  
"Excuse us !" Toji said raising his hand at her.  
“打扰一下！” 冬二举手向她示意。  
  
"What ?" Rei said without inflection.  
“什么？” 丽毫无表情地说。  
  
"Those are the school bulletins you have piled up." Toji answered while pointing his thumb in the general direction of the printouts.  
“那些是你堆起来的学校通知。” 真嗣回答道，同时用拇指大致指了指那些打印件。  
  
"I'm sorry ! I took it upon myself to clean up a little. But I didn't touch anything except trash." Shinji chimed in, raising his garbage bag.  
“对不起！我自作主张稍微整理了一下。但我只碰了垃圾。” 真嗣补充道，举起他的垃圾袋。  
  
Rei blushed. "T-Thank you." Shinji was shocked to see her troubled like this. They then bid her farewell and left her alone.  
绫波脸红了。“谢、谢谢。” 真嗣惊讶地看到她这样困扰。随后他们向她告别，让她独自一人。  
  
Rei then slumped onto her bed. She laid there for some time, her arms in front of her face, deep in thought.  
丽随后瘫倒在她的床上。她躺在那里好一会儿，双臂挡在脸前，陷入沉思。  
  
"Thank you... Words of gratitude. Words I've never used. Not even to him. I cannot spy on Ikari." She spoke to herself, with disappointment, or even disgust in her tone. It was very subtle, but it was there. She was confused, never before had she disobeyed an order, expecially one from the Commander, but she couldn't bring herself to do something that might harm the only person which showed real kindness towards her.  
“谢谢你……感激的话语。我从未用过。甚至对他也没有。我不能监视碇。”她自言自语，语气中带着失望，甚至是厌恶。虽然很微妙，但确实存在。她感到困惑，从未违抗过命令，尤其是来自司令的命令，但她无法让自己去做可能伤害唯一一个对她展现真正善意的人的事情。  
  
.  
  
.  
  
On their way home, they didn't speak once again but Toji wanted to know more about what Shinji had told him. "What did you mean ? When we were at Rei's."  
在回家的路上，他们再次没有说一句话，但东治想知道更多关于真嗣告诉他的事情。“你是什么意思？我们在丽那里的时候。”  
  
"Oh. I-I meant that doing something for someone. O-Or just t-talking, can lead to good things." he didn't really like where the conversation was going, one wrong step and Toji would learn about him and Asuka.  
“哦。我——我的意思是，为某人做些什么。或——或者只是交谈，都可能带来好结果。”他不太喜欢对话的走向，一步走错，东治就会发现他和明日香的事。  
  
"Do you have something to tell me then ?" Toji sensed that there was something more to this story, so he pushed Shinji.  
“那么，你有什么要告诉我的吗？”东治感觉到这个故事还有更多内情，于是他追问真嗣。  
  
"Erm... I m-mean that I've been alone most of the time... B-before I arrived here... So it's something that I had never learned." It was getting more and more uncomfortable for Shinji, he had to think of something fast. But just as he was about to mumble incomprehensibly, an idea came to his mind. "Y-You see, if I had talked to you instead of letting you punch me without doing anything, maybe we could have avoided it altogether."  
“呃……我的意思是，我大部分时间都是一个人……在来到这里之前……所以这是我从未学过的事情。”对真嗣来说，情况越来越不自在，他必须尽快想出办法。但就在他准备含糊其辞时，一个念头闪过脑海。“你瞧，如果我当时和你交谈而不是让你什么都不做就揍我，也许我们就能完全避免这种情况。”  
  
Satisfied with this answer Toji answered. "Yeah... I guess you're right..."  
对这个回答感到满意，冬二回应道：“嗯...我想你是对的...”  
  
Still frightened about the possible outcome he wished to avoid, Shinji decided to make a hasty retreat. Running away was still his preferred strategy in many situations. "Well, I-I have to go this way, I have some errands to run. Bye !" He went away without waiting for Toji to answer. He had thought about it when walking with Toji. Asuka wouldn't be home tonight, it was the perfect moment so he decided to put his plan into motion. And for that, he indeed had some errands to run.  
尽管仍对可能的后果感到恐惧，真嗣决定迅速撤退。在很多情况下，逃跑依然是他的首选策略。“呃，我-我得走这边，我有些事要办。再见！”他不等冬二回答就离开了。在和冬二一起走的时候，他就考虑过。明日香今晚不在家，这是最佳时机，所以他决定实施他的计划。为此，他的确有些事要办。  
  
"Bye..." Toji answered. "... Eva pilots are sure weird all right."  
“再见...”冬二回答道。“...EVA 驾驶员果然都很奇怪。”

### Chapter 7 : Hold on

And here's a new chapter. Just finished proofreading it. I hope I didn't miss too many mistakes !  
又是一章新内容。刚刚校对完。希望没漏掉太多错误！  
  
Oh and I edited the third chapter. I realized some time ago that I didn't put the whole thing here. I forgot all the beginning. My bad !  
哦，对了，我修改了第三章。不久前才发现这里没放完整。我忘了开头部分。我的错！  
  
  
  
Spending the evening with Hikari had been nice. Even though Asuka wasn't entirely looking forward to seeing how the night would go. She was still too proud to show her weaknesses, so she hid how she felt to Shinji, but she knew that her nightmares hadn't disappeared, that they were still there, waiting to come back. She tried not to think about it, enjoying the time she was spending with her best friend. They had a good time chatting about this and that, exchanging pleasantries, cooking (Asuka even helped !), Hikari had wanted to ask her if she wanted to cook something for Shinji, but abstained when she remembered why Asuka was here in the first place. She wanted to talk to her about him though, to understand what was in her mind, but she didn't want to sour the mood.  
与光共度这个晚上感觉不错。尽管明日香并非完全期待夜晚的进展。她依然骄傲地不愿展示自己的弱点，所以对真嗣隐藏了自己的感受，但她知道那些噩梦并未消失，它们仍在那里，等待着卷土重来。她尽量不去想这些，享受与挚友共度的时光。她们愉快地聊着天南地北，互致问候，一起做饭（明日香甚至帮了忙！），光本想问她是否愿意为真嗣做点什么，但想起明日香来此的初衷便作罢了。她想和明日香谈谈他，想了解她心中的想法，但又不想破坏此刻的气氛。  
  
  
  
Long story short, they had a great time, nothing to complain about.  
简而言之，他们玩得很开心，没什么可抱怨的。  
  
  
  
'Is she going to tell me about her crush for Jock Stooge one day ?!' Except that. Finding stuff to complain about had always been one of Asuka's strong suit. Except that this time, her complain was justified. Her whole plan relied on this, and she knew that demanding answers was the easiest way to fail her little operation miserably. And Asuka Langley Soryu did not fail. She had to wait. Which was another problem, since she wasn't known for her patience. Waiting for Hikari to spit it out was taking a toll on her nerves. She wanted to lead the discussion towards him, but the only things she could think about concerning Toji were demeaning to say the least, and since she had never called him by his name, she thought it wouldn't work as planned. She still had time, she could still wait until the next morning, when they would be on their way to school.  
‘她有一天会告诉我她对那个肌肉棒子的暗恋吗？！’除了这个。找茬向来是明日香的长项。只是这次，她的抱怨不无道理。她的整个计划都依赖于此，而她知道，要求答案是最容易让她的行动惨败的方式。但明日香·兰格雷不会失败。她必须等待。这又是一个问题，因为她以缺乏耐心著称。等待光开口让她神经紧绷。她想引导话题转向他，但关于真治，她能想到的都至少可以说是贬低之词，而且她从未叫过他的名字，她认为这样计划不会奏效。她还有时间，还可以等到第二天早上，他们上学路上再说。

The evening passed and gave way to the night. The two girls went to bed in Hikari's room, which, in the image of her resident, was tidy and clean, almost spartan, with very few decorations and furnitures, yet still felt welcoming and cozy. It was rather big, with a double bed, a meridian in one corner, a desk on the opposite corner and a TV. Asuka was sleeping on a futon on the floor between the bed and the TV. They went to her room relatively early, not to bother (and be bothered by) her family. They played video games for a while, idly chatting at the same time. Eventually, they decided to go to bed and call it a night, but Asuka didn't want to sleep yet.  
夜晚悄然降临，两位女孩在光房间里安顿下来。房间如主人一般整洁干净，几乎简朴，装饰和家具寥寥无几，却依然给人温馨舒适之感。房间相当宽敞，有一张双人床，一角摆放着屏风，对面角落有书桌和电视。明日香睡在床和电视之间的地板上的蒲团上。她们早早来到她的房间，以免打扰（也避免被打扰）她的家人。她们玩了一会儿电子游戏，同时闲聊着。最终，她们决定上床睡觉，结束这个夜晚，但明日香还不想入睡。  
  
  
  
"So, wanna talk about Suzuhara ?"Asuka finally asked, her voice low so as not to disturb Hikari's family. She couldn't stand waiting anymore.  
“那么，想聊聊铃原吗？”明日香终于问道，声音压得很低，以免打扰到光的家人。她再也等不下去了。  
  
  
  
"How did you know ?" Hikari replied a bit startled.  
“你怎么知道的？”光有些惊讶地回答。  
  
  
  
"It's pretty obvious. The three stooges are the only ones who can't see it." Asuka answered, smiling. A reassuring smile which was meant to show that she wasn't judging her friend. Not that it was very much visible in the dark room.  
"“这很明显。只有那三个傻瓜看不出来。” 明日香回答道，微笑着。这是一个安抚性的微笑，意在表明她并没有评判她的朋友。不过，在昏暗的房间里，这微笑并不十分明显。”  
  
  
  
"Ikari seems naive" Hikari stated, once again trying to steer the conversation towards Shinji. If she was to talk about her crush, so was Asuka, she thought.  
"“碇看起来很天真” 光子说道，再次试图将话题引向真嗣。她想，如果她要谈论她的暗恋对象，那么明日香也应该如此。”  
  
  
  
"Actually, he's just a dolt" Asuka said, raising a finger to emphasize her point. "He's an idiot too. He hasn't got any idea as to how to relate to others."  
"“实际上，他就是个笨蛋” 明日香说，举起一根手指强调她的观点。“他也是个白痴。他根本不知道如何与人相处。””  
  
  
  
"Why are you always like this when talking about him ? Do you hate him that much ?" Hikari was disappointed. Once again Asuka wasn't going to tell her anything, nor be honest with herself.  
“为什么每次提到他你都这样？你真的那么讨厌他吗？”光子感到失望。又一次，明日香不会告诉她任何事情，也不会对自己诚实。  
  
  
  
Asuka didn't expect that question. And she didn't want to lie to her friend, yet she couldn't tell her the truth. As much as she trusted her, this was their thing. Hers and Shinji's. She had already compromised enough by telling Misato, she wasn't about to tell anyone else yet. "I... Don't hate him... I... We... He's one of the only ones who can understand me..." She lamely answered, unnerved by her hesitation. "Since he's a Pilot as well." And quickly added. She didn't know what else she could say to be honest without saying too much.  
明日香没想到会被问到这个问题。她不想对朋友撒谎，但又不能说出真相。尽管她信任光子，这是她和真嗣之间的事情。她已经向美里透露了不少，现在还不想告诉其他人。“我……并不讨厌他……我……我们……他是少数能理解我的人之一……”她尴尬地回答，对自己的犹豫感到不安。“因为他也是一名驾驶员。”她迅速补充道。她不知道还能说些什么，说实话，说太多会泄露太多。  
  
  
  
"Then why are you always like this with him ?" Hikari asked, quite surprised that she had been able to coax this much from her friend.  
“那为什么你总是这样对他？”光子问，对能从朋友那里套出这些话感到相当惊讶。  
  
  
  
"... I don't know. To be honest I don't mind spending time with him that much. I want things to be clear I guess. We live together, we train together, we fight together... I don't want people to think that we could be a thing." It was mostly an honest answer. 'This is our secret. Nobody has to know.' She added mentally.  
“……我不知道。老实说，我并不介意和他共度时光。我想让事情变得明朗些。我们住在一起，一起训练，一起战斗……我不希望人们认为我们可能是一对。”这基本上是一个诚实的回答。‘这是我们的秘密。没人需要知道。’她在心里补充道。  
  
  
  
"Most people already believe it Asuka. Some of your admirers gave up on you because of that." Hikari stated. She wasn't too keen on gossiping, but her role of class representative meant that she had ears everywhere.  
“大多数人已经这么认为了，明日香。因为你，一些仰慕者已经放弃了。”光子说道。她并不热衷于八卦，但作为班代表，她无处不在的耳朵意味着她总能听到各种消息。  
  
  
  
'And I don't want to find out what they'd do if they knew.' Asuka thought before answering, getting carried away. "And some others think of it as a challenge. Those same _boys_ who only want me as a trophy." She spat the word with visible disgust.  
‘而且我不想知道如果他们知道了会怎么做。’明日香在回答前想道，情绪有些激动。“还有一些人把它视为挑战。那些只把我当作奖杯的男孩们。”她带着明显的厌恶吐出这个词。  
  
  
  
"I thought you liked the attention." Hikari wasn't sure about herself when she said that. But she heard this directly from Asuka in the past, who had always taken great pride in not going unnoticed.  
“我以为你喜欢被关注。” 光说这话时不太自信。但她曾亲耳听明日香说过，明日香总是以不被忽视为傲。  
  
  
  
"I do hate it !" She blurted out vehemently. "They are just lusting after my appearance, my body. It's shallow and it signifies nothing. Even worse, I'm the Red Demon for most of them ! They can't stand me yet they want me. I feel sick just thinking about them !" Her mind went back to Shinji and what he told her about his mother. 'None of these jerks can understand me, or would even try to. And I still lock out the only one who can...'  
“我确实讨厌它！”她激烈地脱口而出。“他们只是贪图我的外表，我的身体。这肤浅至极，毫无意义。更糟的是，对大多数人来说，我是红魔！他们既无法忍受我又渴望我。光是想到他们我就觉得恶心！”她的思绪回到了真嗣和她谈及他母亲的时候。‘这些混蛋没人能理解我，甚至不愿尝试。而我却把唯一能理解我的人拒之门外...’  
  
  
  
Seeing her best friend like this, Hikari was moved, she had never told her such personal things before. "It's unusual for you to be this open. I'm glad you trust me enough to tell me all this."  
看到她最好的朋友这样，光感到动容，她从未向她透露过如此私密的事情。“你这样坦诚很少见。我很高兴你信任我，愿意告诉我这一切。”  
  
  
  
"I don't talk about myself, you're right. I don't like to. But I learned there's some good to be had when talking, so I'm trying..." She paused not sure of how to continue, and having talked about her enough for now. "Can I ask you one thing ?"  
“我不谈论自己，你说得对。我不喜欢那样。但我发现谈话有时也有好处，所以我在尝试……”她停顿了一下，不确定如何继续，而且已经谈够了关于她自己的事。“我能问你一件事吗？”  
  
  
  
"What ?" Hikari knew that the conversation just came back to her and her crush.  
“什么？”光知道话题又回到了她和她的暗恋对象上。  
  
  
  
"What do you see in a simple minded stooge like that ?" Asuka asked calmly, her tone indicated to Hikari that she wasn't insulting him. Much.  
“你在一个头脑简单的跟班身上看到了什么？”明日香平静地问，她的语气让光明白她并没有太多侮辱他的意思。  
  
  
  
"His compassion..." Hikari answered, blushing.  
“他的同情心……”光回答道，脸颊泛红。  
  
  
  
"I really don't understand you sometimes..." She stated, nonplussed. Inside, however, she was happy, her plan had worked, again, with some adjustments, maybe, but it had worked, with the benefit of having shared something with someone, which relieved her of a weight on her shoulders. Even though it hadn't been her goal, she was happy to feel relieved of it. 'One more success for Asuka Langley Soryu, strategist.' She amusedly thought. "That being said, I can help you. How would you like to eat with him at school ?"  
“有时候我真的搞不懂你……”她语气平静，内心却欣喜不已。她的计划再次奏效了，或许有些调整，但确实成功了，与某人分享了些什么，这让她卸下了肩上的重担。尽管这并非她的初衷，但能感到轻松还是让她欣喜。‘又是赤木律子，策略家的一次胜利。’她暗自得意。“话虽如此，我可以帮你。你想在学校和他一起吃饭吗？”  
  
  
  
"You could do that ?" Her voice couldn't have sounded happier.  
“你能做到吗？”她的声音听起来无比开心。  
  
  
  
"I can use my influence so that the Stooges and us eat together. I'll have to tell everything to the idiot, of course. We'll tell the other Stooges that it's NERV related, they'll never suspect anything." Asuka explained.  
“我可以利用我的影响力，让斯图格斯们和我们一起吃饭。当然，我得把一切都告诉那个傻瓜。我们会告诉其他斯图格斯这是 NERV 相关的事，他们绝不会怀疑什么。”明日香解释道。  
  
  
  
"I don't know." As much as she would have liked to eat with Toji, Hikari still wasn't sure.  
“我不知道。”尽管她很想和冬二一起吃饭，光还是不太确定。  
  
  
  
"Don't worry. I'll make sure he won't tell anyone." Asuka had already thought of everything. And she knew Shinji wouldn't jeopardize the both of them being able to spend more time together.  
“别担心。我会确保他不会告诉任何人。”明日香已经考虑周全了。而且她知道真嗣不会破坏他们俩能更多时间在一起的机会。  
  
  
  
"But we'll be using him. It doesn't seem fair." Hikari inquired, worried.  
“但我们将会利用他。这似乎不太公平。” 光担忧地问道。  
  
  
  
Asuka hadn't thought about this, because she knew he was the one who had wanted this in the first place. The idea had crossed her mind as well, but she didn't want to admit it to him. Thankfully, the answer came naturally to her. "This is nothing compared to what I'll have to endure. I'll have to be there too ! Plus, he'll have the privilege of basking in my glory."  
明日香之前并未考虑过这一点，因为她知道这原本就是他自己的意愿。这个念头也曾闪过她的脑海，但她不想向他承认。幸运的是，答案自然而然地浮现在她心中。“这跟我将要承受的相比根本不算什么。我也得在场！而且，他还能享有沐浴在我荣耀中的特权。”  
  
  
  
"And you'll be able to spend more time with him !" Hikari teased, hoping that after what she had said, Asuka would finally take the hint !  
“而且你还能和他共度更多时光！” 光打趣道，希望她的话能让明日香终于领会到暗示！  
  
  
  
"Don't push it. This is a great sacrifice I'm willing to make to help you. You'll be forever in my debt !" Asuka joked in her most solemn tone.  
“别逼我。这是我为了帮你而愿意做出的巨大牺牲。你将永远欠我人情！”明日香用她最严肃的语气开玩笑道。  
  
  
  
"I agree ! When do we start ?"  
“我同意！我们什么时候开始？”  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
With all that he had to do, Shinji arrived home later than usual, laden with several grocery bags. "I'm home." he said automatically as he kicked off his shoes while focusing on not dropping anything. When he reached the kitchen, was greeted by one of his roommates.  
尽管有许多事情要做，真嗣回家比平时晚了许多，手里提着好几个购物袋。“我回来了。”他一边说着，一边踢掉鞋子，同时努力不让任何东西掉落。当他走进厨房时，一位室友迎接了他。  
  
  
  
"Hey Shin-Chan, I thought you'd be here when I arrived !" Misato said before seeing him struggling a little with his burden. "Oh my ! What's all this ? I thought we had enough groceries for a while ! " She added as she came closer to him, not to help, but to rummage through one of the bags. "Hmmm, potatoes, sausages, flour, chocolate..." She then added with an overly teasing tone, even for her. "Well well well ! Does my lovely Shinji intend to do something special for his lovely girlfriend ?"  
“嘿，真嗣君，我以为你会在我到的时候在这里呢！”美里说着，看到他正费力地搬着东西。“哦，天哪！这都是些什么？我还以为我们的食物够吃一阵子了呢！”她边说边走近他，不是为了帮忙，而是翻看其中一个袋子。“嗯，土豆，香肠，面粉，巧克力……”她用一种连她自己都觉得过分的调侃语气补充道，“哎呀呀！我可爱的真嗣是想为他的可爱女朋友做点特别的事吗？”  
  
  
  
Shinji instantly blushed upon hearing the word 'girlfriend'. "Y-yeah... Sh-she's not here t-tonight, so I wanted to surprise her." he stuttered lamely.  
听到‘女朋友’这个词，真嗣的脸立刻红了。“嗯……是……她今晚不在，所以我想给她个惊喜。”他结结巴巴地回答。  
  
  
  
"That's so very sweet of you Shin-Chan !" Misato kept on teasing him, ruffling his hair in the process. "You're such a sweetheart !" Shinji couldn't do anything but stay frozen while Misato was punishing him with her teasing skills. She finally stopped and took his bags to put them on the kitchen table. "I'm sorry Shinji. It's just that I'm really happy for you guys !"  
“真嗣君，你真是太贴心了！”美里继续逗他，顺手揉乱了他的头发。“你真是个甜心！”真嗣只能僵在原地，任由美里用她的调侃技巧‘惩罚’他。她终于停了下来，把袋子拿到厨房桌上。“对不起，真嗣。我只是真的很为你们高兴！”  
  
  
  
Regaining his composure enough, he finally spoke. "T-that's alright... Misato-San, c-can I ask you something ?" Shinji asked, clearly embarrassed.  
他终于恢复了镇定，开口问道：“那、那没关系……美里小姐，我、我可以问你一件事吗？” 真嗣问道，显然很尴尬。  
  
  
  
But embarrassed from what he had to ask or what she had done, Misato had no clue. "Of course, what is it ?" It took her as a consequence all her willpower not to start teasing him again.  
但究竟是因为他要问的问题还是她所做的事情而感到尴尬，美里毫无头绪。“当然可以，是什么事呢？”她竭尽全力才忍住不再次逗弄他。  
  
  
  
"I... Don't know when we'll be able to... But... You know..." He was too sheepish to finish his sentence.  
“我……不知道我们什么时候才能……但是……你知道的……” 他太害羞了，以至于无法说完这句话。  
  
  
  
"You're just too sweet ! Of course I won't be there to get in your way ! Just tell me when you know and I'll go out with Kaji if I'm not at NERV dealing with paperwork !" She did her best to keep her tone and expression as happy as it was, even while thinking about how much work she still had to do in the aftermath of the last Angel battle.  
“你真是太贴心了！当然我不会妨碍你的！只要你知道时间，我就会和加持出去，如果不在 NERV 处理文件的话！”她尽力保持语气和表情一如既往地愉快，尽管心里想着在上次使徒战斗后还有多少工作等着她。  
  
  
  
"... Sorry." Shinji felt guilty for imposing himself and his ideas on her. Not to mention Pen Pen, whose fridge was to be partly commandeered in order to store the ingredients he had bought. It was the only place where he was sure Asuka wouldn't go to.  
“……抱歉。”真嗣为自己强加于她和他的想法感到内疚。更别提企鹅 Pen Pen，它的冰箱将被部分征用来存放他购买的食材。这是他确信明日香不会去的地方。  
  
  
  
'Don't worry about it ! I told you. You deserve to be happy. Both of you, so if I can help, count on me to do it !" Misato brushed his worries cheerily. "I saw you rented a movie. Don't forget to watch it before you guys eat, so at least you have one thing to talk about !"  
“别担心！我告诉过你。你们俩都值得幸福。如果我能帮忙，尽管找我！”美里愉快地打消了他的忧虑。“我看到你租了一部电影。别忘了在吃饭前看，这样至少你们有话题可聊！”  
  
  
  
It's at this moment that it hit him. For most of his life, Shinji Ikari had been alone. Living with his teacher had been nothing more than convenient, he had a roof over his head, food in his plate, but barely any social interaction. At this time, he merely existed, and it was enough for him, at least, it felt like it was enough. But upon hearing Misato's answer, he finally understood that living with others could be so much more, and he realized how much he had missed in the last years. Getting closer to Asuka had opened his eyes. And Misato helped him understand that things that could have been so trivial, so insignificant, were incredibly important. Her helping him was one thing, Toji standing up for him was another, Rei smiling to him was one too. In the past, he would have brushed these things off, but now they were impossible to ignore. They overwhelmed him. He managed to finally answer a simple "Thank you." with tears in his eyes and a cracking voice.  
就在这一刻，他恍然大悟。一生中的大部分时间，碇真嗣都是孤独的。与老师同住不过是权宜之计，他有栖身之所，有盘中餐，却鲜有社交互动。那时，他只是勉强生存，至少感觉上已足够。但听到美里的话后，他终于明白与他人共处可以如此丰富多彩，意识到自己过去几年错过了多少。与明日香走近让他眼界大开。美里则让他懂得，那些曾被视为微不足道的小事，实则至关重要。她伸出援手是一回事，剑介为他挺身而出是另一回事，绫波对他微笑亦是如此。以往，他或许会忽略这些，如今却无法视而不见。它们如潮水般淹没了他。他终于哽咽着，眼中含泪，简单地道了声“谢谢。”  
  
  
  
Misato understood. She had seen how the boy used to be in the few months that she had known him. It was heartwarming for her to see him growing like he was doing. She thus settled for a slight nod and a smile before leaving him alone. She faintly heard Shinji pleading and negotiating with Pen Pen in order to use his fridge for a few days over the sound of the TV.  
美里明白。她认识这男孩的几个月里，见过他以前的样子。看到他像现在这样成长，她感到暖心。于是她微微点头，微笑着离开，让他独自一人。她隐约听到真嗣在电视声中恳求和与 Pen Pen 讨价还价，以便使用他的冰箱几天。

Like every day since she had moved in with them, Shinji had prepared Asuka's lunch for the day. He had been slightly disappointed as a consequence when he saw her eating a bento prepared by Hikari. Only slightly because he was really happy to see her. It had not even been a full day, but he got used to having her sleeping next to him really quickly. He had settled for giving his extra lunch to Toji.  
自从搬来和他们一起住后，真嗣每天都为明日香准备午餐。当他看到她吃着光子准备的便当时，他有些失望。只是稍微有点，因为他真的很高兴见到她。虽然还不到一天，但他很快就习惯了她睡在旁边。他决定把多余的午餐给冬二。  
  
  
  
"Shinji, that's a hidden talent ya got there. The Demon really can't appreciate anything !" Toji exclaimed, his mouth still filled with food. He had been glad to eat a properly cooked meal instead of the disgusting food of the cafeteria, but he hadn't anticipated it to be this good !  
“真嗣，你这可是隐藏技能啊。那个魔女真是什么都不懂！”冬二大声说道，嘴里还塞满了食物。他很高兴能吃到一顿像样的饭菜，而不是食堂那恶心的食物，但他没想到会这么好吃！  
  
  
  
Shinji however, felt rather conflicted. On the one hand, even as small as it was, this praising of his cooking filled him with joy. He hadn't been praised a lot during his short life, so each and every one were memories he kept close to his heart. The small ones like this one and the more important ones alike. On the other hand, it was getting more and more difficult for him to keep a straight face when his friends insulted his girlfriend... Misato's choice of words sure had a way to stir the young boy's mind. He had kept a long part of the night thinking about it. Of course he had already given it some thought, but never had it been so overpowering before. 'Girlfriend ?' The question kept ringing in his brain. Just one word. One word which carried so much implications. 'Is she my girlfriend ?' The idea thrilled him, but he couldn't talk to her about it, lest he suffered a swift retribution. If the discussion was to be brought up, she would be the one to do it.  
然而，真嗣感到相当矛盾。一方面，尽管这份对烹饪的赞扬微不足道，却让他满心欢喜。在他短暂的人生中，赞扬并不多见，因此每一份都成了他珍藏在心的记忆，无论是这样的小事还是更为重要的时刻。另一方面，当朋友们侮辱他的女朋友时，他越来越难以保持镇定...美里选择的词汇确实有办法搅动少年的心弦。那一夜，他久久思索。当然，他之前也考虑过，但从未如此强烈。'女朋友？'这个问题在他脑海中不断回响。仅仅一个词。一个蕴含着如此多含义的词。'她是我的女朋友吗？'这个想法让他兴奋，但他不敢与她谈论，以免遭受迅速的反击。如果这个话题要被提起，那也应该是她来开启。  
  
  
  
It was the only thing he could think about, consequently, he wasn't able to suppress the grimace which contorted his features when he heard the blow directed at his fellow pilot.  
这是他唯一能想到的事情，因此，当听到针对他同伴驾驶员的攻击时，他无法抑制住扭曲的表情。  
  
  
  
"What is it ? What did she do ?" Kensuke didn't fail to notice this slip in his friend's composure. Toji's face grew more serious as he put down the bento box to fully concentrate on what Shinji would say.  
“怎么了？她做了什么？” Kensuke 没有错过朋友这一瞬间的失态。随着将便当盒放下，Toji 的脸色变得更加严肃，全神贯注地准备听 Shinji 要说的话。  
  
  
  
"Nothing !" he quickly answered. Much too quickly not to be suspicious.  
“没什么！”他迅速回答。快得让人不得不怀疑。  
  
  
  
"Very convincing. Come on, tell us !" Toji pressed.  
“非常有说服力。来吧，告诉我们！”Toji 追问。  
  
  
  
"She was at Hikari's yesterday. How could she have done anything ?" Shinji said, matter-of-factly. He felt guilty for being glad for so many reasons that she wasn't there last night. He had missed her, her presence, her warmth, her scent, but he couldn't deny that it had been convenient for him. And it kept on being convenient, which made him feel even guiltier.  
“她昨天在光那里。她怎么可能做了什么？” 真嗣实事求是地说。他为这么多理由而庆幸她昨晚不在感到内疚。他想念她，她的存在，她的温暖，她的气息，但他不能否认这对他来说很方便。而且这种方便一直在持续，这让他感到更加内疚。  
  
  
  
"Oh. Well then, I hope you enjoyed your respite." Kensuke joked. "It must have been nice to have a peaceful evening for once !"  
“哦。那好吧，希望你享受了这段休息时间。” 健介开玩笑说。“一定很棒，终于有了一个平静的晚上！”  
  
  
  
But Shinji just answered "Hmmm." before going back to wallowing in his guilt.  
但真嗣只是回答“嗯。”然后继续沉浸在他的内疚中。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
"I was worried about you." Shinji always felt more comfortable talking in the darkness of their room, when her head was laying on his chest, when she wasn't facing him directly. Since they had told Misato, it was now officially their room, not only hers. That being said, he had slept in his own bed when she wasn't there. He didn't feel comfortable enough yet. He still felt like he would have intruded in her privacy.  
“我很担心你。”真嗣总是觉得在黑暗的房间里交谈更自在，当她的头枕在他的胸口，当她没有直接面对他时。自从他们告诉美里之后，这里正式成为了他们的房间，而不仅仅是她的。即便如此，当她不在时，他还是睡在自己的床上。他还没有感到足够自在。他仍然觉得会侵犯到她的隐私。  
  
  
  
"Seriously Ikari, you really need to stop thinking I'm just a helpless little girl !" Asuka shot back, a little annoyed. 'But never stop worrying about me, please.' Her own mind implored.  
“说真的，碇，你真的需要停止认为我只是一个无助的小女孩！”明日香回击道，有点恼火。‘但请永远不要停止担心我。’她内心恳求。  
  
  
  
"I'm sorry... Ouch !" He yelped in pain as Asuka pinched him. He understood why. "It's just that... That you... Y-you looked tired today a-and you haven't had any nightmares since we..." He wasn't sure it was a good idea to talk about this, but he wanted to be honest with her. And he had genuinely been worried about her.  
“对不起……哎哟！”真嗣痛得叫出声来，因为明日香掐了他一下。他明白为什么。“只是……你……你今天看起来很疲惫，而且自从我们……”他不确定谈论这个是否是个好主意，但他想对她诚实。而且他真的担心她。  
  
  
  
'So you noticed that.' Asuka was surprised, but not in a bad way. "We stayed up late talking." She answered plainly. Shinji, however, had also noticed that Hikari didn't seem as tired as her. "But I had nightmares too. How did you know ?"  
'所以你注意到了。' 明日香有些惊讶，但并非不悦。"我们聊到很晚。"她简单地回答。但真嗣也注意到，相比明日香，光并不显得那么疲惫。"但我也有噩梦。你怎么知道的？"  
  
  
  
He didn't really know how to formulate this. He was sure she would get angry. Against his better judgment, he decided to be truthful with her. "I heard you sometimes before..."  
他不太清楚该如何表达。他确信她会生气。尽管如此，他还是决定对她坦诚。"我之前有时会听到你……"  
  
  
  
"And you never tried to comfort me ?" She did sound a bit angry.  
"而你从未试图安慰我？" 她的确听起来有些生气。  
  
  
  
"I didn't know how ! I-I was sure you'd kick me out of your room, literally." He was getting really nervous now.  
“我不知道怎么做！我——我以为你会把我踢出你的房间，真的。”他现在真的越来越紧张了。  
  
  
  
'You could have just held me.' Asuka thought. "You could have tried." He was right, she probably would have been really pissed at him for seeing her like this, for pitying her. It wasn't as bad now, she knew it was genuine care, not pity, and she could open up more, even if she kept most of her thoughts and feelings to herself.  
“你本可以只是抱着我。”明日香心想。“你本可以尝试一下。”他说得对，她可能会因为他看到她这样而感到非常生气，因为他同情她。但现在没那么糟糕了，她知道这是真心的关怀，不是同情，她可以更敞开心扉，即使她大部分的想法和感受都藏在心里。  
  
  
  
"You want to talk about them ?" Shinji inquired, not knowing where to go from this. However, he held her a bit tighter as a response. He was there now. He would comfort her if he could, right now, it was the only thing he could think about.  
“你想谈谈它们吗？”真嗣询问道，不知道接下来该怎么做。然而，他作为回应将她抱得更紧了一些。他现在在这里。如果可以的话，他会安慰她，这是他现在唯一能想到的事情。  
  
  
  
"No." Her answer was harsh, not leaving any room for discussion. They stayed like this, in each other's arms for some time, in silence. Shinji felt his eyelids getting heavier, the soothing effect of her body against him relaxing him so much that he was almost asleep. "Did you know that Hikari had a crush on one of your stooges ?"  
“不。”她的回答严厉，不留任何讨论余地。他们就这样，在彼此的怀抱中沉默了一段时间。真嗣感到眼皮越来越重，她的身体紧贴着他，带来的舒缓效果让他几乎要睡着了。“你知道吗，光子曾经暗恋过你的一个跟班？”  
  
  
  
Shinji jolted. He wasn't expecting to be pulled out from sleep. Asuka chuckled at his reaction. "She has a crush on Kensuke ?" He asked, drowsy.  
真嗣一惊。他没想到会被从睡梦中拉出来。明日香对他的反应轻声笑了起来。“她暗恋的是健介吗？”他睡眼惺忪地问。  
  
  
  
"On Jock Stooge, idiot ! Gott, you really _are_ dense !" She corrected him, smiling. "Anyway, thanks to them, we have our cover now." She added.  
“是运动型跟班，笨蛋！天啊，你真是迟钝！”她笑着纠正他。“无论如何，多亏了他们，我们现在有了掩护。”她补充道。  
  
  
  
"It was well worth getting yelled at then." He barely finished his sentence before yawning.  
“那被骂一顿也值了。”他话音未落就打了个哈欠。  
  
  
  
"Gute Nacht, Dummkopf !" She said softly before planting a soft peck on his lips. A victory, however small, always made her happy, and being able to gloat about it made it even better.  
“晚安，笨蛋！”她轻声说道，随即在他唇上轻轻一吻。无论多么微小的胜利，总能让她开心，而能为此得意一番更是锦上添花。  
  
  
  
"Good night, Asuka." “晚安，明日香。”

To say that this first lunch they spent together had been awkward was an understatement. Hikari had been thrilled, of course, at first, as well as Asuka and Shinji, even though they didn't show it. Asuka had done a great job at looking deeply annoyed by the situation. In the end, she didn't have to act anymore. The other two didn't seem very happy to have to share this moment of freedom from the painfully dull lessons with the Red Demon and the Pigtailed Dictator. Thus, they all ate in uneasy silence, every small talk and conversation attempts falling flat.  
说他们共度的第一顿午餐尴尬都算是轻描淡写了。起初，光当然很兴奋，明日香和真嗣也是如此，尽管他们没有表现出来。明日香在装出对这种情况深感不悦方面做得非常出色。最终，她连装都不用装了。另外两人似乎并不乐意与红魔和辫子女王共享这难得从枯燥乏味的课程中解脱出来的时光。于是，他们都在不安的沉默中进餐，每一次尝试闲聊或展开对话都以失败告终。

Suffice it to say, Asuka was not happy about that. She hadn't expected the most pleasant lunch break of her life, mainly because it was a silly thing to expect, but at least the two Stooges could have made some efforts. She hadn't spoken much to Shinji on their way to NERV as a consequence, because she didn't want to vent her frustration on him too much, even if it had been his idea in the first place ! As she wasn't sure that she would be able to stay calm, she had settled for quickening her pace, leaving him behind. 'And now I have to go fetch Misato for Doctor Fake Blond. Don't they have phones in this organization ? Gott !' She was about to go change into her plugsuit when she had been asked by Ritsuko.  
总之，明日香对此并不高兴。她并没有期待一生中最愉快的午餐休息时间，主要是因为这种期待太愚蠢了，但至少那两个傻瓜可以稍微努力一下。因此，在前往 NERV 的路上她没怎么和真嗣说话，因为她不想把怒气发泄在他身上，尽管这主意最初是他提出的！由于不确定自己能否保持冷静，她选择了加快步伐，把他甩在后面。'现在我还得去叫美里给那个假金发医生。他们这组织里没有电话吗？天哪！'她正要换上插入栓服时，被律子叫住了。  
  
  
  
She found her in the cafeteria, and was pleasantly surprised to see who she was with. Not as much as she thought she would be though, but hey, she still had to act like she was. "Kaji !" She shouted in her cutest voice. She then turned to Misato. "The doc wants to see you." Before turning back to face Kaji, completely ignoring Misato's answer. "So, are you going to buy me a drink ?" She half asked, half demanded in the same mellow voice.  
她在食堂找到了美里，惊喜地发现她和谁在一起。虽然没有她预想的那么惊讶，但嘿，她还得表现得像那么回事。“加持！”她用最可爱的声音喊道。然后转向美里，“医生想见你。”在完全无视美里的回答后，她转回面对加持，“那么，你要请我喝一杯吗？”她半问半要求地用同样柔和的声音说道。  
  
  
  
"Sure thing kiddo ! I wanted to show you something !" He said as he selected a drink for his former ward. He knew her well enough not to have to ask her what she wanted. They then walked side by side outside until they reached a small garden in a clearing surrounded by various trees with...  
“当然可以，小家伙！我想给你看样东西！”他说着，为他的前监护人选了一杯饮料。他很了解她，不需要问她想要什么。然后他们并肩走出户外，直到来到一片小花园，四周被各种树木环绕着……  
  
  
  
"Watermelons ?" Asuka asked, nonplussed.  
“西瓜？”明日香不解地问。  
  
  
  
"Yeah, aren't they cute ? This is my hobby. Keep it a secret, okay ?" Kaji said cheerily. "Growing... Making something grow is really great. One can see and learn so many things from the process. It also brings pleasure." He had something on his mind, something that he had wanted to talk about with her or Shinji for a while now, so he steered the conversation towards it. Asuka stood still, her eyes on the watermelons, she didn't answer. "Have you found what gives you pleasure, Asuka ?" Kaji continued his monologue.  
“是啊，它们不可爱吗？这是我的爱好。保密哦，好吗？”加持愉快地说道。“种植……让事物生长真的很棒。从中学到很多东西，也能带来快乐。”他心里有件事，已经想和她或真嗣谈一段时间了，于是他引导话题朝这个方向发展。明日香站在那里，目光停留在西瓜上，没有回答。“你找到给你带来快乐的东西了吗，明日香？”加持继续他的独白。  
  
  
  
Images of Shinji came through her mind. A slight smile appeared on her lips. "I don't know." It was an honest answer. Sure, she had something that made her happy right now, but she didn't know if it would last, or even if it was indeed real happiness. There were many questions she still had to answer.  
她的脑海中浮现出真嗣的影像。一丝微笑掠过她的唇边。“我不知道。”这是一个诚实的回答。当然，她现在有让她快乐的事情，但她不确定这份快乐是否会持久，甚至不确定这是否真的是幸福。她还有许多问题需要解答。  
  
  
  
"I think you have..." She turned her head towards him, not sure of where this was going. After a short pause, he continued. "I know about you and Shinji."  
“我想你有……”她转向他，不确定这话题将如何发展。短暂的停顿后，他继续说道。“我知道你和真嗣的事。”  
  
  
  
Asuka's eyes went wide. "How ? I'm going to kill Misato !" She was annoyed, but not that angry. Kaji was one of the few people she trusted, to a certain extent. She wasn't someone who could trust someone blindly. He was still the only one she wasn't mad at for knowing so much about her past. Even though nobody deserved to know, he had proved himself to her.  
明日香的眼睛瞪大了。“怎么可能？我要杀了美里！”她有些恼火，但并没有那么生气。加持是她少数信任的人之一，尽管她不会盲目信任任何人。他仍然是唯一一个知道她过去那么多事却没让她生气的人。尽管没有人应该知道这些，但他已经向她证明了自己。  
  
  
  
"She hasn't told me anything. I checked on you guys when Katsuragi and I came back from the wedding." He paused. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spy on you."  
“她什么都没告诉我。我和 Katsuragi 从婚礼回来后，就来看过你们了。”他顿了顿。“对不起，我不是故意偷看你们的。”  
  
  
  
"That night was..." She trailed off, pensive, before her haughtiness came back. "So..." She started on a teasing tone. "How did it make you feel ? Weren't you sad when you understood that you missed your chance with me ? That no woman you'll ever be with will be as good as I am ?" She flicked her hair over her shoulder with her right hand to emphasize her point.  
“那一晚真是……”她沉思着，话音未落，傲气又回到了她的脸上。“所以……”她用一种挑逗的语气开口。“那让你感觉如何？当你意识到错过了和我在一起的机会时，难道不感到难过吗？你以后遇到的任何女人都不会像我这么好了，不是吗？”她用右手将头发甩到肩后，以强调她的观点。  
  
  
  
"Missed my chance ? I guess you like the boy more than I would have expected !" He joked, making her blush. She turned her head to hide it.  
“错过了机会？看来你比我想象的更喜欢那个男孩！”他开玩笑地说，让她脸红了。她转过头去，掩饰自己的羞涩。  
  
  
  
Asuka was flustered. She hadn't expected her comment to backfire so much. She hadn't expected it to backfire at all, in fact. "I mean..." But she didn't know how to finish that sentence. Having someone tell her this, especially Kaji, had a tremendous effect on her. Indeed, she liked the boy, she trusted him far more than most, she had told him things that almost nobody else knew. She had shared her doubts with him. She had showed him so much in the last days. It scared her. She felt like she was losing herself, that she was losing what characterized her. Yet she couldn't help but feel excited at the prospect as well. She was realizing more and more that she wasn't alone anymore.  
明日香感到慌乱。她没料到自己的话会引发如此大的反弹。实际上，她根本没预料到会有任何反弹。“我是说……”但她不知道如何完成这句话。有人告诉她这一点，尤其是加持，对她产生了巨大的影响。确实，她喜欢这个男孩，她对他的信任远超大多数人，她告诉了他几乎无人知晓的事情。她向他倾诉了疑虑。在过去的几天里，她向他展示了那么多。这让她感到害怕。她觉得自己正在失去自我，正在失去她的特质。然而，她也无法抑制地感到兴奋，因为她越来越意识到自己不再孤单。  
  
  
  
Kaji let the silence linger some time before continuing. "Did you tell him ?"  
加持让沉默持续了一会儿，然后继续问道：“你告诉他了吗？”  
  
  
  
"You know this isn't me... Besides, he knows." She said, staring at the watermelons before her.  
“你知道这不是我……再说了，他知道。”她一边说，一边盯着面前的西瓜。  
  
  
  
Kaji nodded. "Maybe he does. But there are some things that should be said." He trailed off, obviously, it was an advice that stemmed from his own experience. She didn't answer. "You've grown a lot in the last months. It takes a lot of strength to live by oneself, but it takes even more courage to allow others close to you, especially for you." He was about to continue when his phone rang. "Yes ? Hello ?" He paused to listen to his interlocutor. "It's Katsuragi. The sync test will be starting soon."  
加持点了点头。“或许他确实如此。但有些话是应该说出来的。”他话音渐弱，显然，这是源于他自身经验的忠告。她没有回答。“这几个月你成长了许多。独自生活需要很大的力量，但更需要勇气的是允许他人靠近你，尤其是对你来说。”他正要继续说下去，手机响了。“喂？你好？”他停下聆听对方。“是碇司令。同步测试即将开始。”  
  
  
  
Asuka took a few steps towards Central Dogma before she stopped. "Thanks, Kaji."  
明日香向中央教条区走了几步，然后停了下来。“谢谢你，加持。”  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
The next day, Shinji was barely able to contain his impatience. Asuka had been in a good mood since she had reclaimed her position of highest sync ratio holder. She had bragged about it on their way home, during dinner, before sleep and on their way to school in the morning. As a consequence, he was expecting impatiently. Surely, lunch wouldn't go as bad as it had the day before, one might have said that it couldn't. If Asuka was in a good mood, maybe things would be less awkward. When the bell rang, he was about to go to his friends when the school PA system stopped him.  
第二天，真嗣几乎按捺不住自己的急切心情。自从明日香重新夺回最高同步率持有者的位置后，她一直心情大好。从回家的路上，到晚餐时，再到睡前，以及早上上学的路上，她都在炫耀。因此，他满怀期待。当然，午餐不会像前一天那样糟糕，甚至可以说不可能更糟。如果明日香心情好，也许气氛会不那么尴尬。当铃声响起时，他正要走向朋友们，却被学校的广播系统拦住了。  
  
  
  
_Attention student Toji Suzuhara. Toji Suzuhara, report to the Principal's office.  
请学生铃原东治注意。铃原东治，请到校长办公室报到。_  
  
  
  
"What the..." Toji wasn't able to finish his sentence as Kensuke cut him.  
“什...什么...” 真嗣没能说完他的话，因为剑介打断了他。  
  
  
  
"What did you do ?" Kensuke asked. His tone was enough to convey the "again" he left out of the question.  
“你做了什么？” 剑介问道。他的语气足以传达出他没有说出口的“又”字。  
  
  
  
"I don't know." He answered, genuinely unaware as to why he was to go see the Principal. He didn't show it, but he was scared. Scared that it was to tell him bad news about his sister. She was recovering well enough, but it didn't prevent him from being concerned. She was still far from having fully recovered. His fears were mostly unfounded, since she just had some broken bones and some reeducation to undergo, but he couldn't help it. He loved his sister too much not to worry about her.  
“我不知道。” 他回答道，真的不明白为什么要去见校长。他没有表现出来，但他很害怕。害怕是要告诉他关于他妹妹的坏消息。她恢复得还算顺利，但这并没有阻止他担心。她离完全康复还很远。他的恐惧大多是没有根据的，因为她只是有些骨折和一些康复训练要做，但他无法控制自己。他太爱他的妹妹了，不可能不担心她。  
  
  
  
He thus left the classroom without even looking at anyone else. Shinji's shoulders sagged, today wouldn't be the day when he would see his friends start to get along with Asuka. He was all the more surprised when she tapped on his shoulder.  
他就这样离开了教室，甚至没有看其他人一眼。真嗣的肩膀垂了下来，今天看来不会是他看到朋友们开始与明日香和睦相处的日子了。更让他惊讶的是，她拍了拍他的肩膀。  
  
  
  
"So, you guys are coming with us or what ?" She asked, although her tone was neither interrogative, nor amicable.  
“所以，你们是跟我们一起还是怎么着？”她问道，尽管她的语气既非询问，也非友好。  
  
  
  
He looked at her quizzically. "Erm, why ?"  
他疑惑地看着她。“呃，为什么？”  
  
  
  
"Because we have to, idiot. You really think I would spend even more time with you if I had a choice ?"  
“因为不得不这么做，白痴。你真以为如果有选择的话，我会愿意花更多时间和你在一起吗？”  
  
  
  
She had to remind him, but finally Shinji got it, they had to keep the act so they wouldn't blow their cover. At that moment, he had really wanted to slap himself. "S-sorry... Kensuke ?" His friend understood and came, albeit reluctantly.  
她不得不提醒他，最终真嗣明白了，他们必须保持这种行为，以免暴露身份。那一刻，他真想给自己一巴掌。“对-对不起……健介？”他的朋友理解了，尽管不情愿但还是过来了。  
  
  
  
Everyone was surprised at the end of the lunch period. It hadn't been unpleasant, far from it. They had all managed to at least tolerate each other, even if some uneasiness remained. They chatted together about mostly uninteresting things, but it was a major improvement over the previous time. Some insults had been exchanged, of course, but it hadn't soured the mood too much. They had speculated on why Toji had to go see the Principal, talked about how boring their teacher was, about homeworks. Kensuke had talked about his trip to New Yokosuka with Shinji while the girls had talked about themselves as they weren't interested by old warships. All the while, Shinji kept mostly quiet, secretly enjoying every second of this, they all enjoyed it, but Shinji made sure to make the most of it. He had been surprised to receive a message from Kensuke shortly after the class resumed.  
午餐时间结束时，所有人都感到意外。这并非不愉快，远非如此。他们至少都能忍受彼此，尽管仍有些许不安。他们聊着大多是无关痛痒的话题，但这比起上次有了很大进步。当然，有些言语上的冲突，但并未过多破坏气氛。他们猜测了为什么东治得去见校长，讨论了老师的乏味，还有作业。真嗣和阿薰谈起了他们去新横须贺的旅行，而女生们则聊起了自己，对旧战舰不感兴趣。整个过程中，真嗣大多保持沉默，暗自享受每一刻，他们也都乐在其中，但真嗣确保自己充分享受了这一切。课间休息结束后不久，他意外地收到了阿薰的一条消息。  
  
  
  
Kensuke A. : _I really didn't expect the Demon to be able to talk and not scream !_  
阿薰 真嗣：我真没想到恶魔还能好好说话，而不是尖叫！  
  
  
  
Shinji didn't answer, but he smiled. He assumed it was Kensuke's way of saying that he had enjoyed it too. Maybe there was hope !  
真嗣没有回复，但他笑了。他猜这是阿薰表达他也乐在其中的一种方式。或许还有希望！  
  
  
  
Toji came back later and didn't speak a word to anyone. He didn't share Shinji's sentiment. He didn't answer any question, nor did he seem to even hear them. He was too deep in his thoughts. Kensuke tried to press him further to no avail, so he left him moping alone. His impromptu meeting in the Principal's office left him troubled.  
冬二后来回来了，却对谁都没有说一句话。他没有分享真嗣的感受。他没有回答任何问题，甚至似乎连听都没听到。他陷入了深深的思考中。剑介试图进一步追问他，但无济于事，于是他留下冬二独自沮丧。他在校长办公室的临时会议让他心烦意乱。  
  
  
  
'Fourth Child.' He hated his new title. He had accepted because he had managed to have his sister transferred to NERV's hospital, so she would get better treatments, but it left a bitter taste in his mouth. 'Unit 03's pilot.' He had seen how painful it had been for Shinji when he fought, he had understood why he hated piloting. 'Activation test in two days.' He still hated the Evas himself for what happened to his sister, he had forgiven Shinji, but not NERV.  
'第四适格者。' 他讨厌这个新头衔。他之所以接受，是因为他设法让妹妹转到了 NERV 的医院，以便她能得到更好的治疗，但这让他心里很不是滋味。'Unit 03 的驾驶员。' 他亲眼目睹了真嗣战斗时的痛苦，明白了为什么他讨厌驾驶。'两天后进行激活测试。' 他仍然因为妹妹的事情而憎恨 EVA，他原谅了真嗣，但没有原谅 NERV。  
  
  
  
He still was on duty so he stayed in school longer than everyone, thinking about every implications of being an Eva Pilot. The more he thought about it, the more he thought he had made a mistake. He grabbed a late lunch before he finished his chores. Hikari saw him when she made a last round through the school corridors. She stopped to look at him, not knowing what to say or do. Telling him about duty didn't seem like a good idea.  
他仍在值班，因此比其他人留在学校的时间更长，思考着成为 EVA 驾驶员的种种含义。他越是深思，越觉得自己可能犯了个错误。他在完成杂务前匆匆吃了顿迟来的午餐。当光在学校的走廊上做最后一轮巡视时，看到了他。她停下脚步看着他，不知该说什么或做什么。告诉他关于职责的事似乎不是个好主意。  
  
  
  
"Suzuhara ! Are you okay ?" It was the only thing she could think of to break the ice.  
"铃原！你还好吗？" 这是她唯一能想到打破沉默的话。  
  
  
  
"I'm fine. I'll finish my duty after my lunch, don't worry." He said in a flat tone.  
"我没事。吃完午饭后我会完成我的职责，别担心。" 他用平淡的语气说道。  
  
  
  
Hikari guessed from his body language that he wasn't, but didn't insist. She nodded and left him alone.  
光从他的肢体语言猜测他并非如此，但没有坚持。她点点头，让他独自一人。  
  
  
  
After having finished his chores, he went to the basketball court. He stayed there a long time, facing the hoop, still deep in thought. 'I shouldn't have accepted. I should have told that doctor to go to hell !' Yet he couldn't bring himself to run away from it. It was too late of course, and he started to believe that he did belong inside an Evangelion. Now, he would have the power to change things, he would be able to protect his family, his friends, Tokyo-3 and the world. He didn't have to like that, he just had to do it. He threw the ball into the hoop as his resolve hardened. It had taken him excruciatingly long hours to come to this conclusion.  
完成家务后，他去了篮球场。他在那里停留了很久，面对着篮筐，思绪依旧深沉。'我不该接受。我应该让那个医生滚蛋！'然而，他无法让自己逃避这一切。当然，现在为时已晚，他开始相信自己确实属于一台 EVA。现在，他将拥有改变的力量，能够保护他的家人、朋友、第三新东京市和整个世界。他不必喜欢这一点，他只需要去做。随着决心坚定，他将球投向篮筐。他花了极其漫长的时间才得出这个结论。  
  
  
  
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, a gigantic airplane took off, carrying as its cargo the black behemoth which was to become the most defining part of his life.  
与此同时，在太平洋的另一端，一架巨大的飞机起飞了，其货物是一头黑色的巨兽，它将成为他生命中最具决定性的部分。

### Chapter 8 : Little trip to heaven

Hi there ! I finally finished a new chapter ! Enjoy !  
嗨！我终于完成了一个新章节！尽情享受吧！  
  
  
  
She held his hand. It was a simple gesture, but it meant the world for the both of them. Especially since it was outside of the safety of Misato's apartment ! Well, it was in the elevator on their way home, but still.  
她握住他的手。这个简单的动作，对他们两人来说意义非凡。尤其是在美里公寓的安全范围之外！虽然这只是在他们回家的电梯里，但依然如此。  
  
  
  
Sure, they had already done more, but this was different. Ever since her conversation with Kaji, Asuka's curiosity had reached impossible heights. It had taken her some time but finally the need to verify some theories had been too much. And yes. Holding his hand, this simple action, made her feel better. It soothed her. She had already come to terms with the fact that she liked him, yet she still felt the need to prove it to herself. She didn't know if she refused to believe it, or if she just couldn't.  
当然，他们已经做过更多的事情，但这次不同。自从她和加持谈话后，明日香的好奇心达到了前所未有的高度。她花了一些时间，但最终验证某些理论的渴望变得无法抗拒。是的，仅仅是握住他的手，这个简单的行为，就让她感觉好多了。它安抚了她。她已经接受了自己喜欢他的事实，但她仍然觉得需要向自己证明这一点。她不知道自己是拒绝相信，还是无法相信。  
  
  
  
Shinji, for his part, was elated. Everything in his life right now was going so well ! Asuka was getting along well enough with at least one of his friends, he had people who cared about him, and now this. Feeling Asuka's fingers intertwined with his was almost enough to make his mind go blank. He had the feeling that this was going to be a great night.  
对于自己的感受，真嗣感到非常高兴。目前生活中的一切都进展得如此顺利！明日香至少与他的一个朋友相处得很好，他有人关心，而现在又有了这样的进展。感受到明日香的指尖与他的交缠，几乎足以让他的思绪一片空白。他有种预感，这将是一个美好的夜晚。  
  
  
  
The elevator ride had been far too short according to them both, and as soon as it disappeared, they missed the sensation of the other's fingers. Two troubled teenagers thus entered the apartment in silence. The girl went straight to her room while the boy stopped in the kitchen. A few seconds later Asuka came back to the kitchen with a bundle of clothes in her arms and just announced. "I'm going to take a shower."  
对他们两人来说，电梯的行程实在是太短了，一旦电梯消失，他们就立刻怀念起对方手指的感觉。于是，两个心事重重的青少年默默地走进了公寓。女孩直接走向她的房间，而男孩则停在厨房。几秒钟后，明日香抱着一捆衣服回到厨房，并宣布：“我要去洗个澡。”  
  
  
  
"Just a shower ?" Shinji asked and immediately regretted it. He needed time to prepare everything for Asuka, but he couldn't have been less subtle about it. "... I-I mean... Dinner won't be ready for a while... If you want, you can take your time." He justified himself. Or at least tried to. He knew that Asuka always took her time in the bathroom, but tonight he needed all the time he could get.  
“只是洗澡吗？”真嗣问道，随即后悔了。他需要时间为明日香准备一切，但他表现得一点也不含蓄。“……我的意思是……晚餐还要一会儿才能准备好……如果你愿意，可以慢慢来。”他为自己辩解道。至少他尝试了。他知道明日香总是在浴室里花很多时间，但今晚他需要尽可能多的时间。  
  
  
  
Asuka bought it. Though she also understood that her roommate had something on his mind. " What is it, Third Child ?"  
明日香买了它。尽管她也明白她的室友心里有事。"怎么了，第三适格者？"  
  
  
  
"N-Nothing !" He answered much too quickly, and his stuttering didn't help either. "It's just that I'm trying something I haven't done before tonight. So I might take some time to get it right." This was true enough.  
"没-没什么！" 他回答得太快了，结巴也没帮上忙。"只是我今晚在尝试一些以前没做过的事。所以可能需要点时间才能做好。" 这话倒是真的。  
  
  
  
"Come on. Spit it out." She demanded menacingly.  
"快说。别藏着掖着。" 她咄咄逼人地要求道。  
  
  
  
Defeated, Shinji's head dropped, his shoulders slumped. "I wanted to surprise you... Sorry."  
败下阵来，真嗣的头低垂着，肩膀也耷拉下来。“我想给你个惊喜……对不起。”  
  
  
  
Asuka couldn't hide her surprise upon hearing that 'He wants to do something for me ? But why ? And Gott why did I have to ruin everything ? Well played, Soryu.' She didn't even react on his unjustified apology.  
听到那句‘他想为我做点什么？但为什么？天啊，我为什么要毁了一切？干得好，惣流。’明日香掩饰不住自己的惊讶。她甚至对他的无端道歉毫无反应。  
  
  
  
"I'm going to take a bath." She just replied, hoping this would be enough. "Just... Let me know when you're ready."  
“我要去洗澡了。”她只是这样回答，希望这已经足够。“只是……准备好的时候告诉我一声。”  
  
  
  
Shinji raised his head just in time to see her disappear towards the bathroom. He sighed in relief and smiled to himself.  
真嗣抬起头，正好看到她朝浴室走去。他松了口气，暗自微笑。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
Almost two hours later. Shinji had done everything he had to do. If only Asuka hadn't been as inquisitive, the surprise would have been perfect. Two hours was the bare minimum for her when she felt like taking a bath. He never really knew what she was doing in there for that long, he never understood what was so appealing in soaking in one's own bad memories.  
将近两个小时后。真嗣已经完成了他必须做的一切。如果明日香不那么好奇，这个惊喜就完美了。两个小时是她洗澡时最短的时间。他从来不知道她在里面那么久到底在做什么，也不明白泡在自己的糟糕回忆里有什么吸引人的。  
  
  
  
Pen Pen had been very happy to get his whole fridge back. And Shinji was relieved not to have to suffer the penguin's passive-aggressive behavior anymore. Shinji could have sworn that every time he wanted to walk somewhere in the apartment, there was something for him to step on or to make him stumble. His toothbrush and other personal belongings also disappeared and reappeared in incongruous places. Shinji thought that it was a bit over the top, but endured it nonetheless.  
Pen Pen 很高兴能拿回他的整个冰箱。真嗣也很庆幸不用再忍受这只企鹅的被动攻击行为了。真嗣敢肯定，每次他想在公寓里走动时，总有东西让他绊倒或摔跤。他的牙刷和其他个人物品也会消失，然后出现在不合逻辑的地方。真嗣觉得这有点过分，但还是忍了下来。  
  
  
  
He had called Misato, almost too late, but she had dismissed his worries with encouragements and just a little bit of teasing which had made him squirm.  
他给美里打了电话，几乎太晚了，但她用鼓励和一点点调侃打消了他的担忧，这让他有些局促不安。  
  
  
  
The table was set, the food was in the fridge, the sausages wouldn't take long to cook. "You can come out, Asuka." She stormed out of the bathroom and into the dining room before he had finished his sentence, wearing an over-sized shirt and a pair of cotton shorts. "How long have you been waiting ?" Shinji asked, not even trying to hide his surprise.  
桌子已经摆好，食物在冰箱里，香肠不需要太长时间烹饪。“你可以出来了，明日香。”她从浴室冲进餐厅，还没等他说完话，穿着一件 oversized 的衬衫和一条棉质短裤。“你等了多久？”真嗣问道，毫不掩饰自己的惊讶。  
  
  
  
"So, what is it ?" She ignored him. She knew she should have waited a little longer but she just couldn't. So she concealed her embarrassment by looking for anything that was out of the ordinary. The table was set nicely, but there was no plates. She kept looking around her when she noticed something very peculiar. "Where is the TV ?"  
“那么，是什么事？”她无视了他。她知道自己应该再等一会儿，但她就是忍不住。于是她掩饰自己的尴尬，寻找任何不寻常的东西。桌子布置得很漂亮，但没有盘子。她继续环顾四周，这时她注意到一件非常奇怪的事情。“电视在哪里？”  
  
  
  
"I-I moved it into my room. I r-rented a movie." Having to rush through everything in order to be as fast as possible not to keep her "locked up" in the bathroom for too long had occupied his mind, but his nervousness came back to him as soon as she had entered the room.  
“我……我把它搬到我房间了。我租了一部电影。”为了尽可能快地完成所有事情，不让她在浴室里“被锁住”太久，他急匆匆地忙碌着，但当她一进房间，他的紧张感立刻又回来了。  
  
  
  
"And it took you that long ?" She asked sneeringly. "You really should put some muscles on that body of yours."  
“花了你这么长时间？”她嘲讽地问，“你真该在身上练点肌肉。”  
  
  
  
"I cooked too." He answered coldly, a bit hurt.  
“我还做了饭。”他冷冷地回答，有些受伤。  
  
  
  
"I was kidding Shinji ! What do we eat ?"  
“我开玩笑的，真嗣！我们吃什么？”  
  
  
  
It took him a few seconds to regain his composure. 'Shinji ? Did I hear that right ? She called me by my name, without insults or anything ?' He couldn't believe it, it had already happened, but so rarely that it always had the same effect on him. "W-we should watch the movie first..."  
他花了好几秒钟才恢复镇定。‘真嗣？我没听错吧？她叫了我的名字，没有侮辱也没有别的？’他简直不敢相信，虽然这种事已经发生过，但实在太少见了，以至于每次都让他感到同样的震撼。“我们……应该先看电影……”  
  
  
  
"I know. It doesn't matter. I'm hungry !" She said, smiling.  
“我知道。没关系。我饿了！”她笑着说。  
  
  
  
It took him a few minutes finish his preparations. Asuka was sitting at the kitchen table, intently watching him while getting her nostrils filled with the delicious smell of cooked sausages. Shinji then put two plates on the tables.  
他花了好几分钟才完成准备工作。明日香坐在餐桌旁，目不转睛地看着他，同时鼻子里充满了香肠煮熟的美妙香气。随后，真嗣将两个盘子摆在了桌上。  
  
  
  
"Kartoffelsalat ? I hope it wasn't too difficult." She said sarcastically. Too sarcastically, in fact. "I really appreciate it. It looks very good, thanks." She added with a smile, reaching to Shinji's hand with her own.  
“土豆沙拉？希望这不会太难做。”她带着讽刺的口吻说道。事实上，讽刺得有些过头了。“我真的很感激。看起来很不错，谢谢。”她微笑着补充道，伸手握住了真嗣的手。  
  
  
  
Shinji blushed. "You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to find proper ingredients for western food here." This lightened the mood, Asuka's comment was already forgotten and they ate in silence. Shinji remembered that had they watched the movie first, they would have had something to talk about, but this wasn't uncomfortable, quite the contrary. They both were enjoying just being together, and even if it tasted a bit strange to him, he liked the food nonetheless. Asuka was too, she was savoring each and every bite she took, for once, not shoveling it in her mouth as fast as possible. "Y-You didn't put your hair clips back, I l-like when you let your hair down." Shinji said shyly.  
真嗣脸红了。“你无法想象在这里找到做西餐的合适食材有多难。”这句话缓和了气氛，明日香的评论已被遗忘，他们默默地吃着。真嗣记得如果他们先看了电影，就会有话题可聊，但这种沉默并不令人不适，恰恰相反。他们都很享受只是在一起的时光，即使食物对他来说有点奇怪，他仍然喜欢。明日香也是如此，她细细品味每一口，这次没有狼吞虎咽。“你……你没把发夹夹回去，我……我喜欢你放下头发的样子。”真嗣害羞地说道。  
  
  
  
Asuka blushed as well and decided to change the subject after a few seconds of relatively awkward silence. "Gott I didn't know I'd miss proper food that much. That really was a nice surprise Third Child !" She was feeling a bit homesick however. Not that she considered that she had a proper "home". She didn't consider the house she lived in with her father or NERV Berlin home. But she missed her country. She had spent the first thirteen years of her life there, Germany was her home. A home where she didn't stand out as much in a crowd, a home which had shaped her into the young woman she was. She was starting to feel a bit melancholic, so she put those feelings aside for now. "Some sake would go along nicely with this !"  
绫波也脸红了，几秒钟相对尴尬的沉默后，她决定换个话题。“天哪，我没想到我会这么想念正宗的食物。这真是个美妙的惊喜，第三适格者！”然而，她确实有些思乡。并不是说她认为自己有一个真正的“家”。她不认为和父亲或 NERV 柏林住的房子是家。但她想念她的国家。她在德国度过了生命中的前十三年，那里是她的家。一个在人群中不那么显眼的地方，一个塑造了她成为现在这个年轻女性的地方。她开始感到有些忧郁，所以暂时把这些情绪放在一边。“来点清酒会和这个很搭！”  
  
  
  
"But Asuka..." She cut him.  
“但是绫波……”她打断了他。  
  
  
  
"I know I know, we're too young to drink alcohol. Gott, you're no fun !" She said playfully.  
“我知道我知道，我们太年轻不能喝酒。天哪，你真没趣！”她开玩笑地说。  
  
  
  
"Do you want dessert ?" Shinji asked when they had both finished their plate.  
“你想吃甜点吗？”两人都吃完盘中的食物后，真嗣问道。  
  
  
  
Asuka had stuffed herself with the main course, since she hadn't been expecting more. She was about to politely decline when Shinji took said dessert out of the fridge. "Black forest cake ?! Don't tell me you made it yourself !"  
因为没想到还会有甜点，明日香已经把主菜吃得饱饱的。她正要礼貌地拒绝，这时真嗣从冰箱里拿出了甜点。“黑森林蛋糕？！别告诉我这是你自己做的！”  
  
  
  
"I did." Shinji simply stated, blushing, again, understanding from her reaction he had made a good choice.  
“是我做的。”真嗣简单地回答，脸又红了，从她的反应中他明白自己选对了。  
  
  
  
"What are you, stupid ? Of course I want some ! You could have told me before !" Shinji cut two slices and put them on the table. As soon as Asuka's plate touched the table, she pounced on the dessert as if she had been starving for weeks. "That's so good ! One of the best I've ever eaten !" She said with her mouth full, not caring anymore about good manners. If she were being honest, she wouldn't have said that. It was his first time baking it, after all. But the intention, the care behind it, and the fact tat she hadn't eaten Black Forest cake since before she left Germany largely compensated for his lack of practice. "You do realize that from now on, you're going to have to make me more anytime I'll ask, right ?" She sighed in contentment as she finished her plate, rubbing her stomach contently with her right hand. "Let's go to your room !" Shinji blushed upon hearing that. "To watch the movie, pervert." She paused and smirked. "I ate way too much to do anything else." She added teasingly. 'And I spend way too much time with Misato !' She added mentally.  
“你是不是傻？当然要吃！你早该告诉我的！” 真嗣切了两片放在桌上。阿斯卡的盘子一碰到桌子，她就扑向甜点，仿佛已经饿了几个星期。“太好吃了！这是我吃过的最好吃的之一！” 她嘴里塞满食物说道，不再顾及礼仪。说实话，她不会这么说。毕竟这是他第一次做。但背后的心意、关怀，以及自从离开德国后就没再吃过黑森林蛋糕的事实，很大程度上弥补了他的经验不足。“你得明白，从现在开始，只要我要求，你就得给我做更多，对吧？” 她满足地叹了口气，吃完盘子里的食物，右手满意地抚摸着肚子。“去你房间吧！” 真嗣听到这话脸红了。“看电影，变态。” 她停顿了一下，得意地笑了。“我吃得太多了，做不了别的。” 她打趣地补充道。‘我跟美里待得太久了！’ 她心里补充道。  
  
  
  
Shinji fell off his chair and quickly stood up, trying -and failing miserably- to look as if nothing happened. They both went to his room. He had installed the TV across from his bed and had brought every pillows and blankets he felt comfortable taking so that they would have a cozy place to watch the movie in.  
真嗣从椅子上摔了下来，迅速站起身，试图——却极其失败地——装作什么都没发生。他们一起走进他的房间。他在床对面安装了电视，并带来了所有感觉舒适的枕头和毯子，以便他们能在一个舒适的地方看电影。  
  
  
  
It was nothing much, but Asuka was really pleasantly surprised. "Why your room ?" She asked.  
这并不算什么，但明日香真的感到非常惊喜。“为什么在你的房间？”她问道。  
  
  
  
"It doesn't have windows. So nobody will be able to-to s-spy on us." When he realized what he had said, he blushed even more. He tried to cover himself by adding. "It's the only place we're sure Section 2 will not watch."  
“这里没有窗户。所以没人能——能偷窥我们。”当他意识到自己说了什么时，脸更红了。他试图通过补充来掩饰，“这是我们唯一确定第二支部不会监视的地方。”  
  
  
  
He didn't see how much Asuka blushed as well. She said nothing as she flopped on the small bed. She gestured him to come next to her, then showed her appreciation and thankfulness by snuggling as close to him as possible, wrapping him in her arms. "Thank you, Shinji." She murmured before kissing him passionately. "This night is getting better by the minute." She said giddily. Shinji couldn't answer and just pressed play on the remote. The movie started with Henry Purcell's music and a black screen, then the images shown train tracks filmed from above, then a typical pre-Second Impact western Europe landscape from a train window...  
他没有注意到明日香也脸红了。她一言不发地倒在床上，示意他靠近她，然后紧紧依偎在他身边，用双臂环绕着他，表达她的感激之情。“谢谢你，真嗣。”她低声说道，随后热情地吻了他。“今晚每分每秒都在变得更好。”她兴奋地说。真嗣没有回答，只是按下了遥控器上的播放键。电影以亨利·珀塞尔的音乐和黑屏开始，随后画面展示了从上方拍摄的火车轨道，接着是从火车车窗看到的典型的第二次冲击前的西欧风景……  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
"You know, I wasn't really sold on a romantic movie, but this one was really good." Asuka whispered to break the silence. They had been holding each other on Shinji's bed for the entire film, snuggling against each other to be as comfortable as possible, but none of them spoke a single word before the ending credits started to roll. It was a simple story, a boy meets a girl in a train and decide to stay together in Vienna for the night. Talking and learning about each other in the process.  
“你知道，我本来不太喜欢看爱情片，但这部真的很不错。”明日香低声打破了沉默。整部电影期间，他们一直依偎在真嗣的床上，尽可能舒适地紧贴着对方，但在片尾字幕开始滚动之前，他们都没有说一句话。这是一个简单的故事，一个男孩在火车上遇到了一个女孩，决定在维也纳共度一夜，在交谈中了解彼此。  
  
  
  
"It was nice seeing Europe. Does it still look like this ?"  
“看到欧洲真好。它现在还是这样吗？”  
  
  
  
"Austria isn't Germany, but it looks similar enough. It's not completely like this though. Second Impact messed things up pretty bad in Germany too." She paused. Again, getting brought back to her youth in Europe. It's not that she disliked Japan. In fact, the more she lived there, the more she liked it, for several reasons. But still, she was a stranger, a _gaijin_, in this country. It had been disturbing enough when she started dreaming -or having nightmares- in Japanese instead of German. She felt like she was losing her roots. Again, she mentally blocked those thoughts for the time being. Shinji had not wanted to make her wistful with this. He wanted to make her happy, and thus, there was something that she wanted to return the favor. "You know... They kind of reminded me of us..." She was looking at a dark corner of Shinji's room. "They started talking and fell..." She quickly corrected herself. "And got closer..." Then trailed off. "But it has only been one sided. For us I mean... When I talked to Kaji yesterday, he told me one thing..." Shinji was unsettled as seeing Asuka like this. She wasn't her usual self. She sounded scared, almost timid. "I guess what I want to say is..." She paused, gathering her courage. She paused for a long time. The silence was getting heavier in the room but he didn't want to interrupt her. Whatever she wanted to say, she would say when she would have decided. He wasn't about to try and force her to say anything. He just held her a bit tighter.  
奥地利虽非德国，却也颇为相似。但并非完全如此。第二次冲击在德国也造成了极大的混乱。”她顿了顿，思绪再次被拉回到在欧洲的青春岁月。并非她不喜欢日本，事实上，随着时间的推移，她愈发喜爱这里，有诸多原因。然而，她始终是个异乡人，一个外人。当她开始用日语做梦——或噩梦——而非德语时，那种不安感尤为强烈。她觉得自己正在失去根基。她再次暂时将这些念头抛诸脑后。真嗣并非有意让她陷入怀旧之情。他希望她快乐，因此，她也有意回报这份心意。“你知道吗……他们让我想起了我们……”她的目光投向真嗣房间的暗角。“他们开始交谈，然后……”她迅速纠正道，“然后关系更近了……”随后声音渐弱。“但对我们来说，这只是单方面的……昨天我和加持谈话时，他告诉我一件事……”看到这样的明日香，真嗣感到不安。她不再是平时的她，声音中带着恐惧，近乎怯懦。“我想说的是……”"她顿了顿，鼓起勇气。她停顿了很久。房间里的寂静愈发沉重，但他不想打断她。无论她想说什么，她决定好了自然会说。他不会试图强迫她说什么。他只是将她抱得更紧了些。  
  
  
  
The silence was broken by something. It took Shinji several seconds to realize that it was his phone. He was startled, already thinking that it was to tell him there was an Angel attack. Asuka showed some signs of frustration but she let him pick up it up. She stayed close to him to listen though.  
寂静被什么打破了。过了几秒钟，真嗣才意识到那是他的手机。他吓了一跳，已经想到可能是通知他有使徒来袭。明日香显露出一些烦躁，但还是让他接起了电话。她紧贴着他，也听着。  
  
  
  
"Hello ?" Shinji asked nervously.  
“喂？”真嗣紧张地问道。  
  
  
  
"Shin-man. I'm outside. Open, I have something important to tell you."  
"真嗣，我在外面。开门，我有重要的事要告诉你。"  
  
  
  
As soon as Shinji hung up the phone, Asuka exploded. "Gott I'm going to kill that Stooge !" She yelled as she bolted towards the front door.  
真嗣一挂断电话，明日香就爆发了。"该死的，我要宰了那个跟班！"她大喊着冲向大门。  
  
  
  
"Asuka wait, if you open the door he'll suspect something !" Shinji pleaded, but Asuka's rage made it impossible for her to listen to reason.  
"明日香，等等，如果你开门他会起疑的！" 真嗣恳求道，但明日香的怒火让她无法听进任何道理。  
  
  
  
"What the Hell are you doing here ?!" She screamed as soon as the front door opened.  
“你到底在这里干什么？！”她一看到前门打开就尖叫起来。  
  
  
  
If Toji had been surprised at seeing Asuka opening the door instead of Shinji, he didn't show it."Not now. Please, Asuka."  
如果真嗣看到是明日香而不是真希波开门感到惊讶，他并没有表现出来。“现在不行。请了，明日香。”  
  
  
  
He had never called her by her name before, so she understood that this was something important. Her anger receded a little as a consequence. "Okay. But you're going to pay for this."  
他以前从未叫过她的名字，所以她明白这是件重要的事。她的怒气因此稍稍减退了一些。“好吧。但你要为此付出代价。”  
  
  
  
"Stay with us. You have to know too." Toji said before sitting at the kitchen table, seemingly not noticing the incriminating evidence all over it. When the three Children were seated, he sighed heavily before speaking. "I'm the Fourth Child."  
“留下来吧。你也必须知道。” 真嗣说完便坐在厨房桌旁，似乎并未注意到桌上那些不利的证据。当三个孩子都坐下后，他重重地叹了口气，然后开口道：“我是第四适格者。”

The night didn't offer much rest for Shinji and Asuka. Toji didn't stay long after his announcement. It would have been useless. If he had come there for comfort, it wasn't being provided by the other two Children. The three of them had stayed silent for some time, Shinji in utter shock, Asuka between disbelief and anger, Toji was expecting something, anything, that never came, which eventually prompted his decision to leave.  
那一夜，真嗣和明日香并未得到多少休息。真嗣宣布后不久，便离开了，留下来也无济于事。如果他是来寻求安慰的，那么其他两个孩子并未给予。三人沉默良久，真嗣震惊不已，明日香则介于难以置信与愤怒之间，而真嗣期待着某种回应，却始终未曾到来，最终促使他决定离开。  
  
  
  
Consequently, the next day was just as bad. None of the Children were in the mood for small talk, Toji wasn't even in class this day, so all of the members of their little group ate alone. '  
因此，第二天同样糟糕。孩子们都没有心情闲聊，真嗣甚至这天都没来上课，所以他们这个小团体的成员都各自用餐。  
  
  
  
'Why did _he_ have to be the Fourth Child ? It doesn't make sense !' Asuka was furious. 'This Stooge will be more of a liability on the battlefield than anything else ! We'll have to hold his hand and make sure he doesn't get hurt rather than focusing on the Angels !.. It's not his hand I'd like to hold ! Aaargh ! And he couldn't have come at a worst moment too !' Her frustration had reached peak intensity since her aborted attempt at talking to Shinji. 'Everything seemed so easy in that movie, so natural, why can't I tell him what I need to tell him like that ? I'm really trying, Shinji... I just can't !' She dropped her head in frustration and disappointment, stifling a sigh with her hands.  
'为什么他非得是第四适格者？这说不通！' 明日香怒不可遏。'这个跟屁虫在战场上只会拖后腿！我们得牵着他的手，确保他不受伤害，而不是专心对付使徒！……我可不想牵他的手！啊啊啊！而且他来得还不是时候！' 自从她试图与真嗣交谈失败后，她的挫败感达到了顶点。'电影里一切都那么简单，那么自然，为什么我就不能像那样告诉他我想说的话呢？我真的在努力，真嗣……我就是做不到！' 她沮丧地低下头，用手抑制住叹息。  
  
  
  
Toji for his part was at school, just not in class. At lunch break, he moved to a roof where no one ever came in order not to be disturbed during his introspection. He was disturbed nevertheless by someone.  
至于真治，他不在教室，而是在学校。午休时，他移动到屋顶，那里没人来，以免在沉思时被打扰。然而，他还是被某人打扰了。  
  
  
  
"Suzuhara..." Rei said to attract his attention.  
"铃原……" 绫波说道，以引起他的注意。  
  
  
  
"Oh, Ayanami, if you're looking for Shinji, he isn't here... You know about it, don't you ?" He paused for a second. "That's funny, you're the last one I expected to come talk to me out of the three of you..." He sounded empty, no emotions at all transpired from his voice. "It's pretty rare for you to be concerned about someone else."  
“哦，绫波，如果你在找真嗣，他不在这里……你知道的，对吧？”他顿了一下。“真有趣，你们三个中，我最没想到会来找我谈话的竟然是你……”他的声音空洞，没有透露出任何情感。“你关心别人，这可真少见。”  
  
  
  
"Really ? I'm not sure I understand." She replied as undemonstratively as him.  
“真的吗？我不太明白。”她以和他一样不带感情的语气回答。  
  
  
  
"You care about Shinji." Toji stated the obvious, even if it was more obvious for him than her.  
“你在乎真嗣。”冬二直截了当地说，尽管这对他来说比对她更明显。  
  
  
  
"His well being is indeed important to me." Rei realized.  
“他的安好确实对我很重要。” 丽意识到了这一点。  
  
  
  
'Thanks for thinking about _my_ well being.' "Yeah. You definitely have something for him." He didn't understand how the conversation came to this point, even though he was the one who brought the subject in the first place. He was getting less and less comfortable with it. The rational part of his mind knew that Rei wouldn't offer him any help on the subject that was troubling him, but it hadn't stopped him from hoping.  
‘谢谢你关心我的安好。’ “是啊。你肯定对他有意思。” 他不明白话题怎么会转到这个点上，尽管是他自己先提起这个话题的。他对此越来越感到不自在。理智的那部分心知肚明，丽不会在这件困扰他的事情上提供任何帮助，但这并未阻止他抱有希望。  
  
  
  
She pondered the idea for some time "I don't think so. Furthermore, it would be inappropriate for me to interfere between Pilot Ikari and Pilot Soryu."  
她对这个想法沉思良久，“我不这么认为。再者，插手碇司令和绫波驾驶员之间的事也不合适。”  
  
  
  
"You mean they..? That would explain why Soryu was so pissed yesterday." He trailed off.  
“你是说他们……？难怪昨天索留那么生气。”他话音渐弱。  
  
  
  
"I am only speculating. I have no certitudes as of yet." This information would have made him blow a fuse normally. He would have questioned his friend on his betrayal until he would have confessed, but he was much to preoccupied by his own problems to pay it any heed.  
“我只是猜测，目前还没有确凿证据。”通常这种消息会让他大发雷霆。他会质问朋友为何背叛，直到对方坦白，但他现在被自己的问题困扰得太深，根本无暇顾及这些。  
  
  
  
Shinji left the classroom as soon as the bell rang, in silence. He isolated himself as well. He didn't want anyone to be the unfortunate victim of his anger.  
铃声一响，真嗣就默默离开了教室。他也选择了自我隔离。他不想让自己的怒火波及无辜。  
  
  
  
'Father, why did you do this ?' He had reflected on this all night, and came to the conclusion that the person responsible for Toji being a pilot was the one who made him come to Tokyo-3 in the first place, the one who was also responsible for all his suffering. 'Why do you always do this ? Why do you do everything you can to destroy everything I care about ? Why...' His blood froze in his veins at that moment. 'He must never find out about Asuka. I can't stand the idea of something happening to her.' His fears for Toji were not forgotten, but they weren't on the forefront of his mind anymore either.  
'父亲，你为什么要这么做？' 他整夜都在思考这个问题，得出的结论是，让真嗣成为驾驶员的罪魁祸首，正是那个让他来到第三新东京市的人，也是那个让他承受所有痛苦的人。'为什么你总是这样？为什么你要不遗余力地摧毁我所珍视的一切？为什么...' 那一刻，他的血液仿佛凝固了。'他绝不能发现明日香的存在。我无法忍受她受到任何伤害。' 他对真嗣的担忧并未消失，但也不再是心头最紧要的事了。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
As tired as he was, Shinji still couldn't sleep. Even Asuka's presence couldn't calm him and allow him a much needed rest. He didn't blame her for sleeping though, she had always been more pragmatic than him, not to mention less attached to Toji. He had pondered for some time why she was asleep now and not the night before, but couldn't find any answer.  
尽管疲惫不堪，真嗣仍然无法入睡。即使是明日香的存在也无法让他平静下来，得到急需的休息。不过，他并不怪她睡着了，她一直比他更实际，更不用说对真嗣的牵挂少了。他思考了一段时间，为什么她现在睡着了而不是前一晚，但找不到任何答案。  
  
  
  
The more he tried to convince himself there was no use in staying awake, that it wouldn't change who was to pilot Unit 03, the more frustrated he got. With himself, mainly, but on a broader level with everything. It was unfair for Toji to be a pilot, to have to suffer like he suffered against the Angels. He managed to free himself from Asuka's embrace without waking her and went to the balcony from the door in her room, leaving it slightly ajar not to wake her up with the sound it could make. Maybe some fresh air would relax him, maybe.  
他越是试图说服自己保持清醒毫无意义，不会改变谁来驾驶 03 号机的事实，就越感到沮丧。主要是对自己，但更广泛地是对一切。让真嗣成为驾驶员，让他像对抗使徒时那样受苦，是不公平的。他设法在不吵醒明日香的情况下挣脱了她的拥抱，从她房间的门走到阳台，轻轻地留下一丝缝隙，以免开门声吵醒她。也许一些新鲜空气会让他放松下来，也许吧。  
  
  
  
"Kaji-San ? You're not asleep ?" He was surprised to see him on the balcony as well, a cigarette in his mouth.  
"加持先生？你还没睡吗？" 他惊讶地看到他也在阳台上，嘴里叼着一支烟。  
  
  
  
"No, not yet." Kaji whispered back without turning his head from the horizon.  
"还没。" 加持低声回应，没有从地平线上转过头来。  
  
  
  
Shinji decided it was a good opportunity to learn some things. "What's my father like ?"  
真嗣觉得这是个学习的好机会。“我父亲是个什么样的人？”  
  
  
  
"Well, there's a surprise question." Kaji retorted with his usual grin forming on his lips. "I thought you'd ask about Asuka. Or even Katsuragi."  
“哎呀，这可真是个意外的问题。”加持像往常一样咧嘴笑着反驳道，“我以为你会问明日香，或者甚至是葛城。”  
  
  
  
"It seems like you're always with my father." Kaji was trying to dodge the question, but Shinji needed answers. He blamed his father for what was happening, and he needed to understand why is father was acting like he was.  
“你好像总是和我父亲在一起。”加持试图回避这个问题，但真嗣需要答案。他把正在发生的一切归咎于父亲，他需要理解父亲为何如此行事。  
  
  
  
"Commander Fuyutsuki is the one who's always with him. Have you been asking around about your father ?" He took one last drag before flipping his cigarette over the railing.  
"指挥官冬月总是和他在一起。你有没有四处打听你父亲的消息？" 他吸了最后一口烟，然后将烟蒂从栏杆上弹了出去。  
  
  
  
"I haven't been around him much." He tried to keep his frustration to himself.  
"我很少在他身边。" 他试图将自己的沮丧隐藏起来。  
  
  
  
"So, you don't really know him ?" Kaji asked, trying to find a new angle to divert the conversation from this subject. 'The boy doesn't need to know how much of an asshole his father is.'  
"这么说，你并不真正了解他？" 加持试图找到一个新的角度来转移话题，'这孩子不需要知道他父亲有多混蛋。'  
  
  
  
"I thought I had learned about him lately. About his work, about my mother... But I just don't know anymore." This time he failed.  
“我以为我最近已经了解了他。关于他的工作，关于我母亲……但我现在真的不确定了。”这次他失败了。  
  
  
  
"People really don't understand themselves Shinji. So they can't understand each other. Understanding 100% of anything is impossible. That's why we spend so much time trying to understand our own motivations and those of others. That's what makes life so interesting." 'And boy, let me tell you, you won't get bored if you try to understand your father !' He joked to himself, his smile getting a little wider.  
“人们真的不了解自己，真嗣。所以他们无法理解彼此。完全理解任何事情是不可能的。这就是为什么我们花费大量时间试图理解自己的动机和他人的动机。这就是让生活如此有趣的原因。”‘而且，孩子，让我告诉你，如果你尝试理解你父亲，你绝不会感到无聊！’他自嘲地笑了笑，笑容稍稍扩大。  
  
  
  
"Does that mean you don't understand Misato-San either ?" Shinji asked, deadpan, wiping Kaji's grin out of his face.  
“那是不是意味着你也不了解美里小姐？”真嗣面无表情地问，擦去了加持脸上的笑容。  
  
  
  
He took a second before answering. "The kanji we use for the word "she" literally means "woman far away". Women will always be on the distant shore of a great gulf of misunderstanding. The current dividing men and women is deeper than the ocean." Kaji said with philosophy. He had come to terms with this theory already, and he felt it was a thing that Shinji needed to know.  
他顿了顿才回答。“我们用来表示‘她’的汉字，字面意思是‘远方的女人’。女性总是处于巨大误解之谷的彼岸。将男女分隔的鸿沟比海洋还要深。”加持带着哲思说道。他已经接受了这一理论，并觉得真嗣需要了解这一点。  
  
  
  
Shinji kept silent for some time, thinking about what he just heard. "Then I'll do everything to reach Asuka on the other side. Or I'll spend my life trying !" He knew Asuka hadn't told him everything about her, and that he didn't understand everything that made her who she was, but he also knew that he genuinely thought every single word he just said.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，思考着刚刚听到的话。“那我会尽一切努力去到明日香的那一边。或者我会用一生去尝试！”他知道明日香没有把所有关于她的事情都告诉他，他也不完全理解是什么塑造了她的个性，但他也知道，他刚才说的每一个字都是发自内心的。  
  
  
  
"You really mean it, don't you ?" Kaji knew this was a rhetorical question, which was promptly confirmed by Shinji nodding his head, a determined frown set on his face. "You guys just might be able to do it, you know. You both are more similar than you think."  
“你是认真的，对吧？”加持知道这是一个反问句，真嗣点头确认，脸上带着坚定的皱眉。“你们或许真的能做到，你们俩比自己想象的还要相似。”  
  
  
  
"She's the strongest person I know. I'm scared that one day she'll wake up and realize how much better she would be if I wasn't in her life !" Shinji said honestly. "I'm not anything like her ! I'm weak, I'm pathetic, I'm worthless !" Shinji raised his voice. He wasn't whispering anymore, in fact, he was almost screaming when he finished his sentence. He was about to continue when Kaji interrupted him.  
"“她是我认识的最坚强的人。我害怕有一天她醒来，意识到如果我的生活中没有我，她会过得更好！” 真嗣坦诚地说道。“我根本不像她！我很软弱，我很可悲，我毫无价值！” 真嗣提高了声音。他不再低声细语，事实上，当他结束这句话时，他几乎是在尖叫。他正要继续说下去，这时加持打断了他。”  
  
  
  
"You're not !" Kaji's didn't raise his voice, but spoke with much more passion and authority now. "Just think back to what you've accomplished since you arrived in Tokyo-3. You climbed into the Eva and protected us every time we needed you to. With barely any hesitation ! You stood in harm's way to protect everyone around you ! You found someone who needs you, even if she might never admit it, to you or anyone else." He turned his gaze to look Shinji in the eyes. "You are braver than you think, Shinji. And you should endeavor to prove it to her." He paused briefly for emphasis. "And more importantly to yourself."  
"“你不是！” 加持没有提高声音，但此刻他的话语充满了更多的激情和权威。“回想一下你来到东京-3 后所取得的成就。你毫不犹豫地爬进 Eva，每次我们需要你时都保护了我们。你毫不犹豫地站在危险面前，保护周围的每一个人！你找到了一个需要你的人，即使她可能永远不会向你或任何人承认。” 他转过目光，直视真嗣的眼睛。“你比你想象的更勇敢，真嗣。你应该努力向她证明这一点。” 他短暂地停顿了一下以强调。“更重要的是，向你自己证明。”  
  
  
  
Shinji wasn't expecting such an outburst, or so much praising. It made him feel better, even if he still had trouble believing it. "I... I will. For her. She's well worth the effort." He paused. "Thank you, Kaji-San." The long-haired man's little speech shook him. Maybe people had a better opinion of him than he thought.  
真嗣没想到会有这样的爆发，以及如此多的赞扬。这让他感觉好多了，尽管他仍然难以相信。“我……我会努力的。为了她。她完全值得这份努力。”他停顿了一下。“谢谢你，加持先生。”这位长发男子的简短演讲震撼了他。也许人们对他的评价比他想象的要好。  
  
  
  
'You're right, she is... And I know someone else who is...' He thought, this little conversation was almost enough to make him rethink the importance of his quest for the truth. "Goodnight, Shinji."  
“你说得对，她确实……而且我知道还有一个人也是……”他想，这场小小的对话几乎足以让他重新思考追寻真相的重要性。“晚安，真嗣。”  
  
  
  
Silently, Shinji went back to bed. Asuka had her back turned to him, so he couldn't see the stray tear which escaped her eye as she closed them. 'I'm not, baka Shinji. I really am not.'  
真嗣默默地回到床上。明日香背对着他，所以他看不到她闭上眼睛时滑落的那滴泪。“我才不值得，笨蛋真嗣。我真的不值得。”

The next day, the sun was scorching in Matsushiro. But the Fourth Child, Toji Suzuhara, designated pilot of Evangelion Unit 03 didn't have trouble breathing because of the stifling heat. It was because it was the second time in his life that he had to breathe a liquid, and the first time that he had time to think about how much LCL smelled like blood.  
次日，松代的天空烈日炎炎。但第四适格者，即 EVA 三号机的指定驾驶员铃原东治，并未因闷热而呼吸困难。这是他人生中第二次不得不呼吸液体，而第一次他有暇思考 LCL 的气味有多像血。  
  
  
  
The first time, he had been too scared to even register what was happening, then too stunned at seeing his friend fight for his life inside the Evangelion.  
第一次时，他惊恐得连发生了什么都未及察觉，随后又震惊于目睹好友在 EVA 中为生存而战。  
  
  
  
For their lives. 为了他们的生命。  
  
  
  
He had been asked to get into his entry-plug while they finished preparations for the test. 'First they make me sit through a boring briefing for hours _too damn_ _early_ in the morning ! And why ? I just need to sit still and focus on my "link" with the Eva. It could have taken three seconds ! Then they make me wait, doing nothing for the better part of the day and now I'm waiting, again, bored out of my mind, again, in this entry-plug, while those nerds finish their calculations on whatever... Well, at least my plugsuit looks cool.' He was about to settle in more comfortably to take a nap when a voice shattered his hopes of dozing off.  
他被要求进入插入栓，而他们还在为测试做最后的准备。'先是让我一大早坐那儿听几个小时的枯燥简报！为什么？我只需要安静地坐着，专注于与 Eva 的“连接”。这事儿三秒钟就能搞定！然后他们又让我无所事事地等了大半天，现在我又得在这插入栓里干等着，无聊透顶，再次无聊透顶，而那些书呆子还在忙着算他们的东西...好吧，至少我的驾驶服看起来挺酷。'他正准备更舒服地躺下打个盹，这时一个声音打破了他的瞌睡梦。  
  
  
  
"Pilot Suzuhara, we're initiating the activation test. Get ready." It was the voice of Dr Akagi, he thought as he grabbed the butterfly handles, closing his eyes and breathing the foul-smelling liquid deeply.  
“碇司令，我们即将开始启动测试。请做好准备。”这是赤木博士的声音，他想道，同时握住蝴蝶形操纵杆，闭上眼睛，深深吸入那股难闻的液体。  
  
  
  
His heart accelerated, and he was pretty sure he was sweating, but he couldn't be sure since it would instantly dissolve into the LCL. 'Here goes nothing.' He grimly thought as the techs spoke over the comm which he wasn't paying attention to, too focused on this particular moment. The tension he hadn't felt throughout the day hitting him full force right now. He wasn't a Pilot before. He still wasn't a Pilot. But he was going to be. Any second now. He thought about Shinji, and regretted again that he punched him as his heart threatened to break through his ribcage. He thought about his sister, who was getting better treatments now that she had been transferred. Thanks to this. He would be able to protect her from now on.  
他的心跳加速，他几乎可以肯定自己正在出汗，但由于汗水会立即溶解在 LCL 中，他无法确定。'没什么可失去的。'他阴郁地想着，技术人员在通讯中交谈，而他并未留意，全神贯注于这一刻。整天的紧张感此刻猛烈袭来。他以前不是驾驶员，现在也不是。但他即将成为。任何一秒都可能。他想起真嗣，再次后悔自己揍了他，心脏仿佛要冲破胸腔。他想起了妹妹，她现在接受了更好的治疗，因为她被转移了。多亏了这一点。从今往后，他将能够保护她。  
  
  
  
The entry-plug's walls turned from black to the kaleidoscope of colors and patterns which signified the Eva's activation before settling on a view of the outside world. An Eva cage, steel and concrete everywhere, ensnaring the giant war machine. Toji didn't have time to admire the "view", however, as his world turned white just a second later.  
插入栓的墙壁从黑色转变为五彩斑斓的图案和颜色，标志着 EVA 的启动，随后定格在外部世界的景象上。一个 EVA 牢笼，钢铁和混凝土无处不在，困住了这台巨型战争机器。然而，东治没有时间欣赏这“景色”，因为下一秒，他的世界变成了一片空白。  
  
  
  
It was at this moment that the Matsushiro Secondary Experiment Facility disappeared in a gigantic explosion.  
就在这一刻，松代第二实验设施在一声巨响中消失了。

A/N : Another one down ! I had this chapter mostly typed for the longest time, but I got stuck towards the end and I just couldn't manage to find what to write, so I procrastinated for a long time before forcing myself to go back and finish it ! I really didn't expect Shinji of all characters to be the hardest to develop for me ! Also, I adopted a second cat, not really interesting, I know, but I can use him as an excuse, he doesn't like when I type because it wakes him up !  
作者笔记：又完成一章！这个章节我大部分时间都在打字，但到了结尾部分就卡住了，怎么也找不到要写的内容，于是拖延了很久才逼自己回去完成它！我真没想到，所有角色中，最难发展的竟然是真嗣！另外，我收养了第二只猫，虽然这并不有趣，但我知道可以用它作为借口，它不喜欢我打字，因为那会吵醒它！  
  
  
  
On an other note, I think I finally found my ending. Took me long enough ! I'm still not sure though and sometimes, I wish there would be someone I could bounce ideas at to see if they are good or just plain stupid !  
另外，我想我终于找到了结局。花了这么长时间！不过我还是不太确定，有时候真希望有人能让我抛出点子，看看它们是好还是纯粹愚蠢！  
  
  
  
I'm still looking for a good image for my cover. I'm pretty sure this one is good enough, but maybe the grass is greener somewhere else !  
我还在寻找适合封面的好图片。我确信这张已经够好了，但也许别处的草更绿呢！  
  
  
  
To conclude, I have to say that I'm sorry. I really wanted to have the fight against Bardiel in this chapter, but I kinda got carried away. The vast majority of this fic is planned, but I'm still unable to precisely know what my chapters will contain.  
总之，我必须说声抱歉。我真的很想在本章中与巴迪尔展开战斗，但我有点跑题了。这篇同人小说的大部分内容都已规划好，但我仍然无法精确知道每一章会包含什么。  
  
  
  
Anyway, thanks again to everyone who reads this. It really means a lot. If you have something to say, don't hesitate to review !  
无论如何，再次感谢所有阅读的人。这对我来说意义重大。如果你有什么想说的，请毫不犹豫地留下评论！  
  
  
  
Bye !
I just copy/pasted my doc file so this time you have my notes and stuff, not really important, but they're there nonetheless !  
我只是复制/粘贴了我的文档文件，所以这次你们能看到我的笔记和其他内容，虽然不是很重要，但它们确实在那里！

### Chapter 9 : Sins of my father

I delayed this chapter long enough ! It's been a few days since I finished it, modifying something now and then but I have to post it ! If I did something completely wrong, please tell me !  
我拖了这章很久了！自从我完成它以来已经过去几天了，时不时修改一些内容，但我必须发布它！如果我完全做错了什么，请告诉我！  
  
  
  
  
The setting sun was bathing everything in an orange hue. Eva Unit 01 was slouched next to a small mountain in order to preserve its power. Having deployed the Evas this far of Tokyo-3 meant that the city would most likely be safe, but it caused logistics problems when it came to powering the humanoid weapons. Numerous rows of huge generators were installed next to power lines to provide the necessary electricity. Unit 01 was facing west, giving Shinji a beautiful view of the sunset over the mountain range. However, he wasn't interested in sightseeing at the moment.  
夕阳如火，将万物染成橙红。Eva 初号机斜倚在一座小山旁，以节省能量。将 Eva 部署到东京-3 如此远的地方，意味着城市可能暂时安全，但这给人形兵器的供电带来了后勤难题。无数排巨大的发电机紧挨着输电线安装，以提供必要的电力。初号机面向西方，让真嗣得以欣赏到山脉上空的壮丽日落。然而，他此刻并无心观赏风景。  
  
  
  
"An accident in Matsushiro ?! No way ! What happened to Misato and Toji ?" He exclaimed with worry.  
“松代发生事故了？！不可能！美里小姐和剑介怎么样了？”他焦急地喊道。  
  
  
  
"Contact hasn't been restored yet." Rei replied only through her radio, which puzzled Shinji a little.  
“尚未恢复联系。”绫波仅通过无线电简短回应，这让真嗣有些困惑。  
  
  
  
"But then, what will we do ?" He was clearly scared. Every time he went to battle, Misato had always been there to guide him. Even if he had disobeyed her orders at times, he always trusted her to have his best interest in mind during those encounters. The only exception was against the ninth Angel, Matarael, but even then, Asuka had told him what to do. She was too far away from him today to be able to come up with a plan that would help them defeat this new Angel.  
"“但接下来，我们该怎么办？”他显然很害怕。每次上战场，美里总是会在那里指导他。即使有时他违背了她的命令，他也始终相信她在那些遭遇中会为他着想。唯一的例外是对抗第九使徒马特拉尔，但即便那时，明日香也告诉他该怎么做。今天她离他太远，无法想出一个帮助他们击败这个新使徒的计划。”  
  
  
  
"Stop whining !" Asuka scolded him as she opened a direct video channel between them both. "There's nothing else we can do now !"  
"“别抱怨了！”明日香一边斥责他，一边在他们之间打开了一个直接的视频通道。“我们现在别无选择！””  
  
  
  
"But how can we fight Angels by ourselves ?" She shot him a look of a mix between disbelief and annoyance. There were three of them against only one, and among them was a trained soldier, a genius who had learned about combat strategies. She discussed with herself whether she should answer or just ignore him when Rei took the decision for her.  
"“但我们怎么能独自对抗使徒呢？”她投给他一个混合着难以置信和恼怒的眼神。他们有三个人，而对方只有一个，其中还有一位受过训练的士兵，一个精通战术的天才。她内心在犹豫是回答他还是直接无视，这时绫波替她做了决定。”  
  
  
  
"Commander Ikari will take command now." Rei's face appeared next to Asuka's, in her own video feed. Had he thought about it, he would have found it strange that the camera from Unit 00 would be behind the pilot, but what he just learned was far more important.  
“伊卡里司令现在接管指挥。”绫波的脸出现在明日香的视频旁边，是她自己的摄像头画面。如果他仔细想过，可能会觉得奇怪，为什么零号机的摄像头会在驾驶员背后，但他刚刚得知的信息更为重要。  
  
  
  
"My father will..." He trailed off, on the one hand reassured to have someone in command of this operation, and on the other, upset that this someone happened to be his father.  
“我父亲会……”他话没说完，一方面因为有人负责这次行动而感到安心，另一方面又因为这个人恰好是他父亲而感到不快。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
Shinji had waited for what seemed like hours for something to happen, but the reality was that it was closer to only one if the position of the sun was to be any indication. His introspection and moping were interrupted when Shigeru spoke. "Target is approaching."  
真嗣等待了似乎好几个小时，但实际情况是，如果太阳的位置可以作为参考的话，其实只过去了一个小时左右。当他陷入沉思和沮丧时，被四郎的话打断了。“目标正在接近。”  
  
  
  
"All units prepare for ground combat." Makoto chimed in through the pilots' radios as well.  
“所有单位准备进行地面战斗。”真琴通过飞行员的无线电插话道。  
  
  
  
Shinji raised his head and squinted his eyes in a vain attempt to shield them from the light of the setting sun. A black silhouette was approaching slowly just between Unit 01 and the sun. Activating his Eva's built in zoom, he managed to identify the black shape better. "No way ! An Angel ? Is this an Angel ?" He asked.  
真嗣抬起头，眯起眼睛徒劳地试图遮挡落日的光芒。在初号机和太阳之间，一个黑色的轮廓正缓缓接近。他激活了 Eva 内置的变焦功能，设法更清楚地辨认出那个黑色形状。“不可能！是使徒吗？这是使徒吗？”他问道。  
  
  
  
"Is this my birthday ?" Asuka exclaimed ecstatically, unaware that she had just interrupted NERV's Supreme Commander. "I get to beat up Jock Stooge today ?"  
“今天是我的生日吗？”明日香兴奋地喊道，完全没有意识到自己刚刚打断了 NERV 最高指挥官的话。“我今天要揍扁那个肌肉白痴吗？”  
  
  
  
"Correct, this is the target." replied said Supreme Commander.  
“没错，这就是目标。”最高指挥官回答道。  
  
  
  
"But this is an Eva ! Toji's piloting it !"  
“但这可是 Eva！是真嗣在驾驶它！”  
  
  
  
"That's all the more reason !" Asuka said as she willed her Eva to stand. "Unit 02, engaging !"  
“正因为如此才更应该！”明日香一边说，一边让她的 Eva 站起身来。“二号机，开始攻击！”  
  
  
  
"Asuka ! You can't !"  
"明日香！你不可以！"  
  
  
  
"Watch me !" She answered cheerily, raising her rocket launcher. "Fire !" A gigantic rocket shot out of her weapon, then another, and another. They flew rapidly towards their target before exploding against the familiar octagonal orange shield. "It's an Eva, idiot ! And an Angel ! It has an AT-field, don't worry about him !" She kept on firing her rocket launcher with a smile on her face. It quickly vanished however when her target jumped at an impossible height. Her combat training allowed her not to be too disoriented when the targeting system of her Eva made it move on its own accord, following the enemy while still shooting rockets until the magazine was empty. She had raised her AT-field as she had kept unloading her weapon at Unit 03. It didn't help, however, when the black behemoth pierced through the smoke, and her AT-field, and landed directly on her with an ear-piercing noise which Shinji heard through the comm window before it turned to static. He still heard Asuka scream from the top of her lungs over the sound of metal crashing against metal, of what sounded like giant fists bludgeoning something metallic before the communication became completely silent.  
“看我的！”她欢快地回答，举起火箭发射器。“开火！”一枚巨大的火箭从她的武器中射出，接着又是一枚，再一枚。它们迅速飞向目标，在熟悉的八角形橙色护盾上爆炸。“是 EVA，笨蛋！还有使徒！它有 AT 力场，别担心他！”她面带微笑，继续发射火箭。然而，当她的目标以不可思议的高度跃起时，笑容迅速消失。她的战斗训练使她在 EVA 的瞄准系统自行移动追踪敌人时，不至于过于慌乱，她持续发射火箭，直到弹匣空空如也。她一边向三号机倾泻火力，一边升起了自己的 AT 力场。然而，当那黑色巨兽穿透烟雾，突破她的 AT 力场，直接落在她身上，发出刺耳的噪音时，这一切都无济于事。真嗣在通讯窗口转为静电前听到了这声音，他仍能听到明日香在金属撞击声中，在巨拳捶打金属的声响中，声嘶力竭地尖叫，直到通讯彻底沉寂。  
  
  
  
He had watched the scene from afar, he mainly saw explosions moving very slowly towards him, then in the air, like inverted fireworks. Black explosions which stood out against the red sun. He could see Unit 03 fall from the sky and saw that the last shots managed to make it deviate slightly from its trajectory.  
他从远处目睹了这一幕，主要看到的是爆炸缓缓向他逼近，然后在空中，如同倒挂的烟花。黑色的爆炸在红日的映衬下格外显眼。他看到初号机从天而降，最后一击成功使其偏离了原本的轨迹。  
  
  
  
"Asuka !" Shinji shouted at the comm window, but he received no answer. "Unit 01, moving to engage !" He shouted with determination and urgency.  
“明日香！”真嗣对着通讯窗口大喊，但没有得到回应。“初号机，准备出击！”他带着决心和紧迫感喊道。  
  
  
  
"No." This lone word was enough to freeze his blood in his veins and his Eva at the same time. "You shall remain at your current location. You are the last line of defense in case Rei fails."  
“不行。”这简短的一个词足以让他的血液凝固，同时让他的 EVA 也停下了动作。“你必须留在原地。如果绫波失败了，你就是最后的防线。”  
  
  
  
Shinji wanted to disagree. Every muscle in his body screamed for him to run and go help Asuka. His father's voice carried far too much authority over him. He reluctantly went back to his initial position. 'What are you doing ?' He asked his father in his mind only. Now was not the time for a father and son discussion. He heard one of the techs saying that Asuka was alive in her entry-plug. It would have to be enough for the time being.  
真嗣本想反驳。他全身的肌肉都在呐喊，催促他跑去帮助明日香。但他父亲的威严太过压倒性。他无奈地回到了最初的位置。'你在做什么？'他在心中默默问道。现在不是父子讨论的时候。他听到一名技术人员说，明日香在插入栓里还活着。这暂时足够了。  
  
  
  
A little further away, Rei was waiting behind a mountain which provided her cover and concealment from the Angel. She could hear its steps as it came closer.  
稍远一些的地方，绫波零躲在一座山后，借助地形隐蔽自己，避免被使徒发现。她能听到使徒逐渐靠近的脚步声。  
  
  
  
"Rei, avoid close range combat and stop the target. I'm sending Unit 01 in now." Commander Ikari said. It was a lie of course, but it wasn't important. Rei wouldn't doubt his words, she would do what she was meant to do. What she was born for.  
“绫波，避免近距离战斗，阻止目标。我现在就派 01 号机进入。”碇司令说道。当然，这是个谎言，但这并不重要。绫波不会怀疑他的话，她会做她该做的事。她生来就是为了这个。  
  
  
  
"Roger." Rei simply answered, trying to focus on the battle. She was struggling, however. One of her fellow pilot was down. A second was imprisoned inside an Angel, maybe he was conscious. Forced to watch as his Eva was attacking the people he knew. The third pilot was upset because of what was happening. It was the main reason why she couldn't fully concentrate on the task at hand. She knew that Shinji was attached to the other two pilots, and that them being hurt was hurting him as well. She also knew that he wouldn't be able to destroy this Angel if it meant injuring his friend in the process. Or worse. She had to do something. She had to help him. She had to be the one to destroy this Angel so that Shinji wouldn't have to. Maybe he would hate her for that, but it was according to her the best alternative.  
"罗杰。" 丽简短地回应，试图专注于战斗。然而，她感到力不从心。一位战友已经倒下，另一位被困在使徒体内，或许还清醒着，被迫目睹自己的 EVA 攻击熟悉的人。第三位驾驶员因当前局势而心烦意乱。这些都成了她无法全神贯注的主要原因。她明白真嗣与那两位驾驶员情感深厚，他们的痛苦也牵动着他的心。她也清楚，若要真嗣摧毁这个使徒，哪怕会伤及朋友，甚至更糟，他都难以做到。她必须采取行动，必须帮助他，必须由她来消灭这个使徒，以免真嗣被迫面对那样的抉择。或许他会因此恨她，但在她看来，这是最佳的选择。  
  
  
  
The Eva walked on her left side, a few dozen meters away, seemingly unaware of her presence and continued on its way. It looked like an animal. It walked without coordination. Its arms hanging on its sides, not moving with the steps it took. Its mouth was opened and shown red teeth. Its eyes looked like Unit 01's, the same menacing shape and white light. It took a few more steps before abruptly stopping and convulsing on its legs as if the pilot was fighting inside to regain control over it. It hunched forward before jumping again and landing on Unit 00, pinning it face first to the ground, its right arm squeezing its neck.  
伊娃走在她的左侧，相隔几十米，看似并未察觉到她的存在，继续前行。它看起来像一只动物，步履蹒跚，毫无协调。双臂垂在身侧，与步伐无关。它的嘴张开着，露出红色的牙齿。眼睛与初号机相似，同样凶狠的形状和白光。它又走了几步，突然停下，双腿抽搐，仿佛驾驶员在内部挣扎，试图重新夺回控制权。它前倾身体，随即再次跃起，落在零号机上，将其正面朝下压在地上，右臂紧紧勒住其脖颈。  
  
  
  
The impact made Rei dizzy for a second before the pain in her cheek made her come to her sense. The first thing she realized was that she couldn't move. The whole weight of Unit 03 was enough to prevent her Eva from any useful movement. 'I can't let him face this by himself.' Rei thought as she started wriggling under her enemy. Her Eva's right arm tried to grab onto something to help her pry herself free. The Angel let go of Unit 00's neck, only to punch the back of its head with uncanny violence in order to keep its enemy in place. Rei didn't feel the impacts as much as if she had received them directly, but it had been enough to make her head spin. Her fading consciousness made each blow a little bit less painful than the one preceding it. Her vision was getting darker and darker, the pain was becoming fainter and fainter. When the black Eva was satisfied with Unit 00's lack of movement, it released a pinkish ooze from its left arm, which poured in heavy drops on Unit 00's arm. Rei barely registered the pain in her numbness and didn't try to fight back. She could only faintly ear what sounded like the Commander's voice giving an order through her ringing ears before she jumped and screamed when an exploding pain ran through her left arm before her Eva was remotely deactivated. She grabbed her left shoulder with her right hand and reluctantly turned her head with greeted teeth, expecting to see her arm severed from her body as it had been the case for her Eva.  
冲击让丽头晕目眩了一瞬，紧接着脸颊的疼痛让她恢复了意识。她首先意识到的是自己动弹不得。零三号机全部的重量足以让她的 EVA 无法做出任何有效的动作。“我不能让他独自面对这一切。”丽想着，开始在敌人身下扭动。她的 EVA 右臂试图抓住什么来帮助自己挣脱束缚。天使松开了零零号机的脖子，转而以惊人的暴力猛击其后脑勺，以确保敌人无法逃脱。丽并未直接感受到这些冲击，但足以让她头晕目眩。她的意识逐渐模糊，每一击都比前一次轻微一些。她的视野越来越暗，疼痛感也越来越弱。当黑色 EVA 对零零号机失去活动能力感到满意时，它从左臂释放出粉红色的黏液，重重地滴落在零零号机的手臂上。丽在麻木中几乎感觉不到疼痛，也没有试图反抗。 她只能隐约听到指挥官的声音透过她嗡嗡作响的耳朵下达命令，随后她因左臂一阵剧痛而跳起尖叫，紧接着她的 Eva 被远程关闭。她用右手抓住左肩，咬紧牙关不情愿地转过头，以为会看到手臂像她的 Eva 那样被切断。  
  
  
  
The Angel was now back up, looking down on its fallen prey for a few seconds before resuming its journey towards its mission.  
天使现在重新站起，低头凝视着倒地的猎物几秒钟，然后继续向其使命前进。  
  
  
  
Shinji heard everything through the comm system in awe, refusing to believe what was happening.  
真嗣通过通讯系统听到了一切，惊叹不已，拒绝相信正在发生的事情。  
  
  
  
"Unit 00 is severely damaged. The pilot is wounded." Maya had just said.  
“零号机严重受损。驾驶员负伤。”真希刚刚报告道。  
  
  
  
"No way..."  “不可能……”  
  
  
  
"The target is approaching you. It will contact you in T-minus 20. You must destroy it." His father said as stoically as always.  
“目标正向你逼近。将在 T-20 时接触你。你必须摧毁它。”他的父亲一如既往地冷静说道。  
  
  
  
"But this target is... Toji's in there, isn't he ?" Shinji stated coolly. "Another friend of mine." He had his pallet rifle raised and pointing at the rogue Eva, but the conflict in his mind at the moment stopped him from pulling the trigger. Unit 03 roared devilishly before jumping at Unit 01 feet first, shattering the latter's weapon in the process. Unit 01 landed on its back as the 13th Angel landed on all fours, which made it possible for Shinji to see the Entry-plug protruding from the former Eva's back. "An Entry-plug. Toji's in there, just as I thought." He said as he made his Eva stand up. Unit 03 launched its right arm which extended impossibly until it took a hold of Unit 01's neck, then the left arm, strangling Shinji in the process. It pinned down its enemy against a hill, its hands firmly grasping the other's neck and squeezing. Shinji was struggling to get air into his lungs, refusing to pass out, yet not doing anything to remove the appendages obstructing his throat.  
"“但这个目标……里面是东治，对吧？” 真嗣冷静地说道，“又是一个我的朋友。” 他举起了自己的步枪瞄准那台失控的 EVA，但内心的冲突让他此刻无法扣动扳机。三号机发出恶魔般的咆哮，然后双脚先跳向初号机，过程中击碎了后者的武器。初号机背部着地，而第 13 使徒则四肢着地，这让真嗣得以看到从三号机背部突出的插入栓。“一个插入栓。东治在里面，正如我所想。” 他说着让 EVA 站起身来。三号机发射了它的右臂，手臂不可思议地延伸，直到抓住了初号机的脖子，接着是左臂，过程中勒住了真嗣。它将敌人压在山坡上，双手紧紧抓住对方的脖子并用力挤压。真嗣挣扎着想要吸入空气，拒绝昏厥，却没有采取任何措施移开阻塞喉咙的肢体。”  
  
  
  
"Shinji, why don't you fight ?" His father's brought him back to reality and helped him focus on something else than his current lack of oxygen.  
"“真嗣，你为什么不战斗？” 他的父亲将他拉回现实，帮助他专注于除了当前缺氧之外的其他事情。”  
  
  
  
"Toji's in there, Father !" he answered with ragged breath.  
“父亲，他在里面！”他喘着粗气回答道。  
  
  
  
"Irrelevant ! It is an Angel ! Our enemy !" Gendo growled, losing his calm against his disobedient son.  
“无关紧要！那是使徒！我们的敌人！”碇源堂咆哮着，面对不听话的儿子失去了冷静。  
  
  
  
"But... But I can't !" He was getting desperate, facing this Cornelian choice. "I must help him ! I can't kill !"  
“但是……但是我做不到！”他面对这个两难的选择，变得绝望起来。“我必须救他！我不能杀人！”  
  
  
  
"If you don't, you will die."  
"如果你不这么做，你就会死。"  
  
  
  
"I'd rather die !" He said, his choice made. "Two of my friends have already been hurt. I won't be responsible for another one !"  
"我宁愿死！" 他说道，决心已定。"我的两个朋友已经受伤了。我不会让另一个再因为我而受伤！"  
  
  
  
"Cut all synchronization between the pilot and Unit 01. Do it now." Was the only answer his father gave.  
"切断驾驶员与 01 号机之间的所有同步连接。现在就做。" 这是他父亲唯一的回答。  
  
  
  
"Cut it ?" Maya interjected disbelievingly.  
“切断它？”玛雅难以置信地插话道。  
  
  
  
"Correct. Switch the control circuit to the dummy plug."  
“没错。将控制电路切换到备用插头。”  
  
  
  
"But the dummy plug still isn't functioning properly." Maya tried, and failed, to reason. "Without Dr Akagi's approval..."  
“但备用插头仍未正常工作。”玛雅试图讲理，却未能成功。“没有赤木博士的批准……”  
  
  
  
"It's still better than the pilot. Do It !"  
“这总比试飞员好。做吧！”  
  
  
  
"Yes, Sir." Maya caved in.  
“是，长官。”玛雅屈服了。  
  
  
  
Shinji had heard all of the exchange through the comm link, but couldn't pay it very much attention. He was trying his best to keep breathing until the inside of his entry-plug turned black and he finally was able to breathe unhindered. The view from the outside world came back quickly though, with a red hue when the dummy system activated. "What is it ?.. What in the hell are you doing, Father ?!" He shouted, not wanting to believe what he was imagining. The only answer he got was his Eva's hands moving on their own, getting higher and higher until finally they reached Unit 03's neck and tightened. Unit 01 barely struggled before overpowering its foe, gaining the upper ground and applying more and more force on its hold until finally, the Angel's neck gave in and broke under the pressure, its limbs going limp while it let out a final growl of agony.  
真嗣通过通讯线路听到了整个对话，但并没有太在意。他正尽力保持呼吸，直到插入栓内变得漆黑一片，他终于能够不受阻碍地呼吸了。外面的世界景象很快恢复，当模拟系统启动时，带着一层红色。“这是什么？…你到底在做什么，父亲？！”他喊道，不愿相信自己所想象的事情。他得到的唯一回应是他的 EVA 的手自行移动，越来越高，直到最终到达 03 号机的脖子并收紧。01 号机几乎没有挣扎就制服了对手，占据了上风，不断加大力度，直到最后，使徒的脖子在压力下断裂，四肢瘫软，发出最后一声痛苦的咆哮。  
  
  
  
The purple Eva wasn't finished however. It threw its now silent enemy on the ground and punched its head with such incredible strength that it exploded in a fountain of blood and bones, splattering everything around it. It then grabbed onto its breastplate and tore it, throwing it away before keeping its assault.  
然而，紫色 Eva 并未就此罢休。它将已无声息的敌人摔在地上，以惊人的力量猛击其头部，使其爆裂成一滩血骨，溅射四周。随后，它抓住敌人的胸甲，撕扯下来抛至一旁，继续其猛攻。  
  
  
  
"Stop this !" Shinji screamed over the comm as its Eva was keeping on pummeling the lifeless Eva Unit 03. "Father, no ! Stop doing this now !" He was shaking the butterfly handles frantically in a vain hope to regain control of his behemoth.  
“住手！”真嗣通过通讯器尖叫，他的 Eva 仍在无情地殴打已无生命的 03 号机。“父亲，不要！立刻停止这一切！”他疯狂地摇动操纵杆，徒劳地试图重新掌控这巨兽。  
  
  
  
He watched powerlessly as his friend was getting destroyed with his own hands until something hit his Eva from the side and sent it crashing several meters away from the bloodbath. When he regained enough of his senses, he saw through the cockpit the silhouette of Unit 02 standing before it "What are you doing idiot ? It's dead !"  
他无助地看着朋友在自己手中被摧毁，直到侧面受到一击，将他的 Eva 击飞数米远，远离那片血腥。当他恢复意识时，透过驾驶舱看到了 02 号机的身影站在面前，“你在干什么，白痴？它已经死了！”  
  
  
  
Asuka was indeed alive. She had been knocked out by Unit 03 but came to with the noises of destruction made by Unit 01. Her Eva was standing victoriously before it as it struggled to stand up. "Asuka ! Go away ! I'm not controlling anything !" Shinji just had time to say before his Eva threw a vicious punch in Unit 02's midsection. It was enough to make the red Eva flinch, but it didn't go down. On the contrary, it used its new position to lunge at Unit 01 head first, tackling it to the ground. Asuka didn't stop there. She stood back up and tried to reach the umbilical cable. She managed to grab it, but Unit 01 used Asuka's lack of focus to its advantage, elbowing Unit 02 on the back of the head then punching it violently in the ribs several times. Asuka shouted in pain at each blow while Shinji was still maniacally shaking the butterfly handles. It then seized it by the torso before lifting it face down, then threw it with inhuman strength as far as it could. Asuka cursed in German before crashing against the mountainside. She had always hated falling in her Eva, not only because falling is seldom an enjoyable experience, but also because her inner ear and brain never managed to understand what was happening. She always felt dizzy and a little sick when it happened. As if it weren't already enough, her spine felt like it broke at the impact. Seeing Unit 02 not standing back up, Unit 01 returned to its original target.  
明日香确实还活着。她被三号机击晕，但被初号机造成的破坏声响唤醒。她的二号机在初号机面前挣扎着站起，显得胜利在望。“明日香！快离开！我什么都没在操控！”真嗣刚来得及喊出这句话，他的初号机就朝着二号机的腹部猛击一拳。这一击足以让红色机体退缩，却没有将其击倒。相反，二号机利用新位置，头槌冲向初号机，将其撞倒在地。明日香并未就此罢休，她重新站起，试图抓住脐带电缆。她成功抓住了，但初号机利用明日香分心的机会，用肘部猛击二号机后脑，随后连续重拳击打其肋部。每一下重击都让明日香痛苦地喊叫，而真嗣仍在疯狂地摇动操纵杆。接着，初号机抓住二号机的躯干，将其面朝下举起，然后用非人的力量将其远远抛出。明日香在撞上山壁前用德语咒骂了一声。 她一直讨厌在 Eva 中跌落，不仅因为跌落鲜少是愉快的体验，更因为她内耳和大脑始终无法理解发生了什么。每次都感到头晕目眩，还有点恶心。仿佛这还不够，她的脊椎在撞击下感觉像是断裂了。看到 02 号机没有重新站起来，01 号机回到了原来的目标。  
  
  
  
It turned it over and grabbed the Entry-plug with its right hand and started squeezing it. The massive purple hand was shaking with the effort. "Damn ! Stop ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it !" Shinji begged as the metal of the Entry-plug was starting to bend under the pressure.  
它翻转过来，用右手抓住插入栓并开始挤压。那只巨大的紫色手因用力而颤抖。“该死！停下来！停下来！停下来！停下来！停下来！停下来！”真嗣恳求道，插入栓的金属在压力下开始弯曲。  
  
  
  
"Arschloch !" Asuka shouted as Unit 02 stabbed Shinji's Eva's forearm with its Progressive Knife and twisted the vibrating blade inside the wound, making it release the cylinder which fell on the ground in a loud ringing noise. "This stupid autopilot should make sure its target is really done before turning its back on it ! By the way, idiot, when I'll tell this story, I'll make sure to tell your friends that you were going to kill Jock Stooge ! They'll ditch your ass and I'll be the hero !" Asuka badmouthed him in order to give her courage, and also because she wanted revenge for Unit 01's last move ! She knew he wasn't responsible for what was happening and she also understood rather quickly what the dummy plug was capable of. She had to stay focused and not expose any weaknesses if she was to win this fight. She pulled out her knife from Unit 01's arm and took a defensive stance a few steps away, making the knife pivot in her Eva's hand so that the blade was facing downward and putting her left hand opened in front of her, ready for a counterattack. Which never came. The purple giant stood still, as if paralyzed. Shinji was back in the darkness, the dummy plug had been deactivated.  
“混蛋！”明日香大喊着，二号机用高振动粒子刀刺入真嗣的 EVA 前臂，并扭动刀刃在伤口内振动，迫使装有机关的圆筒脱落，掉落在地发出响亮的撞击声。“这该死的自动控制系统应该确保目标彻底完蛋后再转身！顺便说一句，白痴，等我讲这个故事时，我会告诉你的朋友们你差点杀了那个蠢货乔克！他们会甩了你，而我将成为英雄！”明日香用恶言壮胆，同时也为了报复初号机最后的举动！她知道他并非这一切的罪魁祸首，也很快明白了傀儡系统的能耐。她必须保持专注，不露破绽，才能赢得这场战斗。她从初号机手臂中抽出刀，后退几步采取防御姿态，让刀在 EVA 手中旋转，刀尖朝下，左手张开在前，准备反击。然而，反击始终未至。紫色巨人静止不动，仿佛被定身一般。 真嗣再次回到了黑暗中，模拟插入栓已被停用。

Two days later, Shinji woke up in a hospital bed. His injuries were not really serious, even if a case could have been made for his larynx. The doctors had decided to keep him sedated for some time in order to help his recovery. The first thing he noticed was as a consequence a familiar ceiling which he had learned to hate. He then noticed someone on the bed next to his. "Toji ?.." He silently stood up and left the room, not daring to look, out of shame and self-loathing, at his friend who was lying in this hospital bed because of him. He couldn't bare the idea of having hurt him. He thus went to the reception desk. "Uhm... Sorry... Could you please tell me in which room Asuka Langley Soryu is ?" He asked hesitantly, almost too scared to go and see for himself what he had done to her as well. What gave him the courage to ask was what he had told her that night. That he would always be there for her.  
两天后，真嗣在医院病床上醒来。他的伤势并不严重，尽管他的喉咙本可以算作一个病例。医生决定让他保持镇静一段时间以帮助恢复。他首先注意到的是一个他已学会憎恨的熟悉天花板。接着，他注意到旁边床上有人。“阿薰？..”他默默地站起来离开了房间，不敢看向因他而躺在病床上的朋友，羞愧和自我厌恶让他无法承受。他无法忍受伤害了他的想法。于是他走到接待台。“呃...对不起...请问你能告诉我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷在哪个房间吗？”他犹豫地问道，几乎害怕亲自去看自己对她做了什么。让他鼓起勇气询问的是那天晚上他对她说过的话。他会一直在她身边。  
  
  
  
The nurse, a woman in her mid forties with black hair tied in a bun raised her gaze from her computer screen and studied him for a few seconds before answering. "Oh, mister Ikari. I'm afraid she hasn't been checked in the hospital after the fight." She looked at her watch. "She must be home then !" She said with a smile, then added awkwardly after a pause. "I've always wanted to say thank you... You know, for saving us all, battle after battle..."  
护士是一位四十多岁的黑发女子，头发盘成一个发髻，她从电脑屏幕上抬起目光，仔细打量了他几秒钟才回答。"哦，碇先生。恐怕她在那场战斗后并没有被送进医院。"她看了看手表。"那她现在一定在家！"她微笑着说，然后尴尬地停顿了一下，补充道。"我一直想对你说声谢谢……你知道的，一次又一次地拯救了我们所有人……"  
  
  
  
She was still talking but Shinji couldn't pay attention to her. He knew he wanted to see Asuka, but that was it. He was still hazy after waking up from what must have been anesthetics induced slumber. He just nodded when he didn't hear the nurse's voice anymore.  
她还在说话，但真嗣已经无法集中注意力了。他知道自己想见明日香，仅此而已。从麻醉引起的沉睡中醒来后，他仍然感到有些迷糊。当听不到护士的声音时，他只是点了点头。  
  
  
  
"Can I help you with something else ?" She added warmly when she saw him still standing there.  
"还有什么我能帮忙的吗？"看到他仍然站在那里，她热情地补充道。  
  
  
  
He shook his head to clear his mind. "Are my clothes here ?"  
他摇了摇头，试图清醒思绪。“我的衣服在这里吗？”  
  
  
  
"I'm really sorry. But we can have them brought from your locker. We have received orders from Major Katsuragi, you can leave as soon as they arrive."  
“真的很抱歉。但我们可以从你的储物柜里取来。我们已经收到了葛城少校的命令，一旦衣服送到，你就可以离开了。”  
  
  
  
"Can I use your phone then ?" Clearly he didn't care about leaving the hospital.  
“那我能用你的电话吗？”显然，他并不在意离开医院这件事。  
  
  
  
Realizing her mistake, she replied too enthusiastically. "Oh ! Sure ! Anything for you, mister Ikari !" She handed him the wireless phone. He walked a few feet away towards the exit before dialing the number of the apartment. He waited until he heard the beginning of the recorded message of the answering machine. He hung the phone up and gave it back to the nurse. "Is Rei Ayanami here ?"  
意识到自己的错误，她过于热情地回应道：“哦！当然！为您效劳，碇先生！”她将无线电话递给他。他走向出口几步远后，拨打了公寓的号码。他等待着直到听见答录机录音信息的开始。他挂断电话，将电话还给了护士。“绫波零在这里吗？”  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
"Disobeying orders, personal occupation of an Eva, attack on one of your fellow Pilots, partial destruction of an Eva... These are all criminal offenses. Do you have anything to say ?"  
“违抗命令，擅自占用 EVA，攻击同僚驾驶员，部分破坏 EVA……这些都是犯罪行为。你有什么要说的吗？”  
  
  
  
Asuka had spent the last two days in a cell in the depths of NERV. They at least had the decency to bring her fresh clothes. So she was there, in the Commander's gigantic office, clad in her school uniform and her wrists restrained with triple cuffs. Her hair was a mess, she had not been allowed to take a shower so they were sticky because of the dried LCL. She had taken down her hair clips and rearranged it in a ponytail to make it look at least presentable enough. Her lower ribcage was bandaged under her uniform. It was uncomfortable for her to breathe, and the lingering pain didn't help either. She was frowning, and was probably just about to explode. "My actions were necessary. I saved a Pilot and his Eva. I don't think Pilot Ikari has been injured because of what I did." She hadn't heard him scream when she stabbed his Eva. "I think this small cut is not important compared to having another Unit at our disposal."  
明日香在 NERV 深处的一间牢房里度过了过去的两天。他们至少还像样地给她带来了干净的衣服。于是她就这样，身着校服，手腕被三重手铐束缚着，站在指挥官巨大的办公室里。她的头发凌乱不堪，由于未被允许洗澡，发丝因干涸的 LCL 而黏腻。她摘下了发夹，重新扎成马尾，试图让自己看起来至少还算体面。她的下肋骨在制服下用绷带包扎着，呼吸时感到不适，持续的疼痛更是雪上加霜。她眉头紧锁，似乎随时都可能爆发。“我的行动是必要的。我救下了一位驾驶员和他的 Eva。我不认为因为我的行为，驾驶员碇真嗣受了伤。”她并未听到他在她刺伤他的 Eva 时发出的惨叫。“我认为与拥有另一台机体相比，这点小伤无足轻重。”  
  
  
  
"Not important ?" Gendo was really displeased upon hearing that the Second Child's lack of regret. Of course, she could not know that she had injured his precious Yui, but he couldn't accept that. "Effective immediately, you are relieved of duty. You are not the Second Child anymore." He didn't raise his voice nor show any emotion, but he wanted to make her suffer as much as possible for what she had done. So he took his time explaining his decision. "We will arrange for you to be sent back to Germany."  
"“不重要吗？”听到二号机驾驶员毫无悔意，源堂真的不悦了。当然，她不可能知道她伤害了他珍爱的唯，但他无法接受这一点。“立即生效，你被解职了。你不再是二号机驾驶员了。”他没有提高声音，也没有表现出任何情绪，但他想让她为自己所做的事付出尽可能多的痛苦。所以他慢慢地解释他的决定。“我们将安排你送回德国。””  
  
  
  
"You can't do that ! I am the Second Child ! I'm Asuka Langley Soryu ! Designated Pilot of Eva Unit 02 ! You need me !" She screamed in rage and denial.  
"“你不能这么做！我是二号机驾驶员！我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！EVA 二号机的指定驾驶员！你需要我！”她愤怒地尖叫着，拒绝接受。”  
  
  
  
"As you said, _Miss_ Soryu. You have saved an Eva and its Pilot. And since we have only needed three Evangelions to repel the Angels so far, your service will no longer be needed." He said, a slight smirk on his lips, hidden behind his hands. "Dismissed."  
"“正如你所说，惣流小姐。你拯救了一台 EVA 及其驾驶员。既然到目前为止我们只需要三台 EVA 来击退使徒，你的服务将不再需要。”他说，嘴角微微上扬，隐藏在双手之后。“退下。””  
  
  
  
'They don't need me.' She was stunned, the impact of what had just happened too much for her. She had lost everything. She had been training her whole life for this single purpose and now it was taken from her. What was she to do now ? She did not even react when two Section 2 agents grabbed her by the arms and dragged her out of the office.  
'他们不需要我。' 她震惊了，刚刚发生的事情对她打击太大。她失去了所有。她一生都在为这个唯一的目标训练，而现在它被夺走了。她现在该怎么办？当两名第二科的特工抓住她的手臂将她拖出办公室时，她甚至没有反应。  
  
  
  
"Are you really sure this was what had to be done ?" Fuyutsuki asked once they were alone.  
"你真的确定这是必须做的吗？" 冬月在他们独处时问道。  
  
  
  
"Positive. She attacked Yui intentionally."  
"绝对肯定。她故意攻击了唯。"  
  
  
  
"According to the Dead Sea Scrolls, the next Angel will be the most powerful."  
"根据死海古卷的记载，下一个使徒将是最强大的。"  
  
  
  
"That's irrelevant. You know how violent and dangerous the Third Child can be given the circumstances. I just gave him those circumstances. Of course the Second could have been kept as decoy, or cannon fodder, yet it will not be necessary. She still could have been useful to us, however now we can replace her with the Fourth in the Scenario." Gendo stated.  
"那无关紧要。你知道在那种情况下，第三适格者可能会有多么暴力和危险。我刚刚给了他那些情况。当然，第二适格者本可以作为诱饵或炮灰，但这已无必要。她原本对我们还有用，但现在我们可以用第四适格者来替代她在计划中的位置。" 碇源堂说道。"  
  
  
  
"He might not be as easily manipulated."  
"他可能不会那么容易被操纵。"  
  
  
  
"He is more stable than the Second." He paused for a second. "I should have known that Dr Soryu would be a mistake. It is good to finally be rid of its consequences. I wasn't expecting her to be able to save both Unit 03 and its Pilot, maybe I should have thanked her for giving us the possibility to get rid of her."  
“他比二号机更稳定。”他顿了一下。“我早该知道，碇唯博士会是个错误。终于摆脱其后果，真是件好事。我没想到她能同时救下三号机及其驾驶员，或许我该感谢她给了我们摆脱她的机会。”  
  
  
  
"Your son will probably hate you for this. Even more so if there was indeed something between them." Fuyutsuki said, maybe to give him a chance to change his mind.  
“你的儿子可能会因此恨你。如果他们之间真有什么，那就更甚了。”冬月说，或许是想给他一个改变主意的机会。  
  
  
  
"It does not matter as long as he carries out with our plan. Furthermore, the more isolated he is, the less he will have to distract him from this mission." Gendo answered coldly. Fuyutsuki winced behind his interlocutor's back but said nothing. However, it didn't mean that he agreed with his superior.  
“只要他执行我们的计划，这无关紧要。再者，他越孤立，就越少有事分散他对这次任务的注意力。”碇源堂冷冷地回答。冬月在他背后皱了皱眉，但什么也没说。然而，这并不意味着他同意上司的观点。

Shinji shyly entered the room where Rei was according to the nurse, slightly opening the door at first and whispering "Ayanami, I'm coming in." The room she was in was smaller than the one he used to occupy, it was only big enough for one bed. "Hi, Ayanami." he said just as shyly.  
根据护士的指示，真嗣羞涩地走进了丽所在的房间，先是轻轻推开门，低声说道：“绫波，我进来了。”她所在的房间比他以前住的要小，仅够放一张床。“嗨，绫波。”他同样羞涩地说道。  
  
  
  
"Hello, Pilot Ikari." She was half sitting, half lying on her bed in her hospital gown. The pillows had been rearranged to allow her to have something to rest her back on. Her head was bandaged, not unlike the first time he had met her all those months ago. However, none of her eyes were covered this time. She also had her left arm in a sling. "What can I do for you ?"  
“你好，碇司令。”她半坐半躺在病床上，穿着医院的病号服。枕头被重新排列，以便她能有个东西靠着背部。她的头部缠着绷带，与几个月前他第一次见到她时的情景颇为相似。不过这次，她的眼睛都没有被遮住。她的左臂还吊着吊带。“我能为你做些什么？”  
  
  
  
"How are you ?"  
“你还好吗？”  
  
  
  
"I am well, thank you. I have just been kept here under observation. I went to see you yesterday. You were still unconscious."  
“我很好，谢谢。我只是被留在这里观察。昨天我去看了你，你还在昏迷中。”  
  
  
  
"I'm glad you're okay, Ayanami." At least one of his friends was alright. "Do you know where Asuka is ? She's not at the hospital."  
“很高兴你没事，绫波。”至少他的一个朋友平安无事。“你知道明日香在哪里吗？她不在医院。”  
  
  
  
"I was unconscious when I have been extracted from my entry-plug. I am not aware of her whereabouts as a consequence." Rei simply stated. It wasn't much, but Shinji was still surprised to hear that many words coming from her.  
“我从插入栓中被救出时处于昏迷状态。因此，我不清楚她的下落。”绫波简单地陈述道。尽管信息不多，但听到她说了这么多话，真嗣还是感到有些惊讶。  
  
  
  
"I'm scared about her. I saw everything that happened during the fight. I'm afraid I might have hurt her." As much as Shinji was interested in Rei's condition, he was more interested in Asuka's. "She isn't home, and she isn't in the hospital. It's too late for her to still be in school. I'm really worried."  
“我对她感到害怕。我目睹了战斗中发生的一切。我担心我可能伤害了她。”尽管真嗣对绫波的情况很关心，但他更担心明日香。“她不在家，也不在医院。现在太晚了，她不可能还在学校。我真的非常担心。”  
  
  
  
"I cannot help you." was Rei's only answer.  
“我帮不了你。”绫波只回答了这一句。  
  
  
  
"Sorry." He said automatically, his mind still focused on Asuka. "Bye." he said as he left the room, not even waiting for an answer.  
“抱歉。”他下意识地说道，心思仍集中在明日香身上。“再见。”他说着离开了房间，甚至没等对方回应。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
He didn't feel like going home. He wanted to go and look for Asuka, but he didn't know where to start, so he decided it would be better to wait for her there. When he entered the apartment, he heard steps coming towards him and saw her rushing in the entryway. She tackled him in a desperate hug. "Where were you ?" She mumbled in his neck as she squeezed him tighter. She had fought against it as much as she could have, but in the end, she had to admit that she _needed_ Shinji after what happened to her. So the time she had waited for him felt like torturous hours. She was a nervous wreck, her eyes were burning, she didn't care anymore about the pain in her chest or the fact that she was still coated in dried LCL.  
他不想回家。他想去找明日香，但又不知从何找起，于是决定还是在这里等她。当他走进公寓时，听到脚步声向他靠近，看到她急匆匆地冲进门口。她紧紧地抱住他，仿佛用尽了全力。“你去哪儿了？”她在他脖颈间喃喃道，手臂更用力地收紧。她曾竭尽全力抵抗，但最终不得不承认，经历了那一切后，她需要真嗣。因此，等待他的每一刻都如同煎熬。她心神不宁，双眼灼热，不再在意胸口的疼痛或身上仍沾满干涸的 LCL。  
  
  
  
"I was at the hospital. I wanted to go and see you but you weren't there so I went to see Ayanami bef..."  
“我在医院。我想去看你，但你不在那里，所以我去看了绫波……”  
  
  
  
"Are you kidding me ?!" This was the last straw for her. Having him go see Rei reminded her too much of what her father had done all those years ago. When he had left her mother when she lost her mind, when she became useless. "I have spent the last two days in a goddamn cell ! That's where I was ! For saving your stupid friend's ass ! And when I was locked up you jumped at the opportunity and went to see Wondergirl ?!" She shouted as she pushed him away, allowing him to see her blood injected eyes.  
"“你在开玩笑吧？！”这对她来说简直是最后一根稻草。让他去找丽，让她想起了多年前父亲所做的一切。当母亲失去理智，变得无用时，父亲离开了她。“过去的两天我他妈一直关在牢房里！我就在那儿！为了救你那蠢朋友的命！而我被关起来时，你却抓住机会去看神奇女孩？！”她一边喊着一边推开他，让他看到她充血的眼睛。”  
  
  
  
"I hoped she knew where you were !" Shinji tried to plea.  
"“我希望她知道你在哪儿！”真嗣试图辩解。”  
  
  
  
"I can't believe it ! When I arrived here, I expected to be able to talk to my boyfriend !" Neither she nor Shinji realized which word she had just used. "I was naively thinking that you'd be there for me, as you promised me ! But you were too busy trying to have your way with that freaking doll !" She had tears in her eyes and her fists were clenched. Her whole body was tense.  
"“我简直不敢相信！当我来到这里时，我本以为能和我的男朋友谈谈！”她和真嗣都没意识到她刚刚用了哪个词。“我天真地以为你会陪在我身边，就像你承诺的那样！但你却忙着和那个该死的玩偶鬼混！”她眼中含泪，拳头紧握。她的整个身体都紧绷着。”  
  
  
  
"You don't understand !" he tried to interject.  
“你不懂！”他试图插话。  
  
  
  
"Don't worry, I won't stand in your way for too much longer ! Just... Leave me alone." She said in a tone Shinji had never heard coming from her before. As if she had just given up. She then turned around and started walking towards her room.  
“别担心，我不会一直挡你的路！只是……让我一个人待着。”她用一种真嗣从未听过的语气说道，仿佛已经放弃了。随后，她转身朝自己的房间走去。  
  
  
  
He didn't understand what she had meant by that but he wasn't about to abandon her nor run away. He thus quickly caught up to her and grabbed her hand. "Asuka, please..." He couldn't finish his sentence as Asuka's other hand connected with his face in a slap which felt more like a punch.  
他不明白她那句话的意思，但他既不会抛弃她，也不会逃跑。于是他迅速追上她，抓住了她的手。“明日香，请……”他话还没说完，明日香的另一只手就狠狠地扇在了他的脸上，那感觉更像是一拳。  
  
  
  
"I hate you !" She screamed, her voice cracking and tears threatening to fall from her eyes. She stormed out of the apartment leaving a shocked Third Child behind her.  
“我恨你！”她尖叫道，声音嘶哑，泪水在眼眶中打转。她怒气冲冲地离开了公寓，留下身后震惊的第三适格者。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
She ran as fast as she could in her injured state until her chest was too painful for her to continue. She had quickly realized what had just happened. She had lost patience yet again. And yet again Shinji had been her victim. And this time she didn't hold back. She wanted to convince herself that it didn't matter since she was being sent back to Germany. But it proved too hard for her. She had thrown away one of the too few good things in her life because of her temper. She wanted to collapse and disappear, but the remnants of her pride made her keep going until she reached her destination.  
她不顾伤势拼命奔跑，直到胸口的疼痛让她无法继续。她很快意识到刚刚发生了什么。她又一次失去了耐心。而真嗣又一次成了她的牺牲品。这次她没有保留。她想说服自己这无关紧要，因为她即将被送回德国。但这证明对她来说太难了。她因为脾气而抛弃了生活中为数不多的美好事物之一。她想崩溃消失，但残存的骄傲让她继续前行，直到抵达目的地。  
  
  
  
Hikari opened the front door and was horrified when she saw her friend's sorry state. She invited her in and took care of her as much as she could. However, Asuka never talked about the things that were obviously upsetting her. As a matter of fact, she didn't talk much at all during her stay. Hikari wanted to help, to alleviate her burden but couldn't find any way to do so. It was especially painful when she could hear her friend cry when she thought no one could. She wanted to reach out to her, but she had no idea what to say. She knew that with Asuka, one wrong step would only make things worse. So she decided to be there. To be present for her at any time. When Asuka woke up because she was having a nightmare, Hikari stayed awake with her in silence, hoping that it would be, if not enough, at least helpful.  
光打开前门，看到朋友那糟糕的状态时，她惊恐万分。她邀请她进来，尽其所能地照顾她。然而，明日香从未谈及那些明显困扰她的事情。事实上，她在逗留期间几乎不怎么说话。光想帮忙，想减轻她的负担，却找不到任何方法。尤其是当她能听到朋友在以为无人时哭泣，这让她特别痛苦。她想伸出援手，却不知该说什么。她知道，对于明日香来说，一步走错只会让事情变得更糟。因此，她决定就在那里，随时陪伴她。当明日香因噩梦醒来时，光与她一同保持清醒，沉默地陪伴，希望即便这不够，至少能有所帮助。  
  
  
  
One day, when Hikari came home from school, she found out that Asuka wasn't there anymore. She left without saying goodbye, it was better that way. She was now waiting for the train which would bring her to the airport, which would in turn bring her back to Germany. At the same time to a former life and to a completely new and unknown one.  
一天，光放学回家，发现明日香已经不在了。她没有告别就离开了，这样也好。她现在正等待着将她送往机场的火车，而机场又将带她回到德国。同时，这也意味着她将回到过去的生活，以及一个全新且未知的未来。  
  
  
  
She had been waiting there for hours, having left early to be sure not to stumble upon Hikari or anyone else, sitting uncomfortably on the floor, cursing Japan for its lack of benches in train stations. Misato came to talk to her. It felt nice, even if she would rather have had Kaji come bid her farewell. It lifted her spirits a little, until Misato spoke about Shinji. Just hearing his name brought memories and feelings that she didn't want to have, so she shouted for Misato to shut up and leave her alone. It was harsh, and she regretted it too, but she just couldn't have this discussion.  
她已经在那里等了几个小时，早早离开就是为了确保不会遇到光或其他任何人，不自在地坐在地上，咒骂日本火车站缺乏长椅。美里过来和她说话。感觉不错，尽管她更希望加持能来和她告别。这让她心情稍稍好转，直到美里提到真嗣。仅仅听到他的名字就勾起了她不想回忆的记忆和情感，于是她大声让美里闭嘴并离开她。这很严厉，她也后悔了，但她就是无法进行这场对话。  
  
  
  
She was wondering what she would do in Germany. What she could do now that she was a nobody, and that nobody cared about her anymore. Not Kaji, who didn't come see her one last time. Did he even know ? Did he even care ? Not Hikari, who didn't even try to talk to her. Not Misato, who didn't pull any strings to have her reinstated. Not Shinji... Especially not Shinji. She probably would have just shouted at him again just to hate herself even more afterwards.  
她不知道在德国该做什么。现在她是个无名小卒，没有人再关心她了。不是加持，他没有来见她最后一面。他知道吗？他关心吗？不是光，她甚至没有试图和她说话。不是美里，她没有动用关系让她复职。不是真嗣……尤其是真嗣。她可能又会对他大喊大叫，然后更加讨厌自己。  
  
  
  
And it was the same in Germany. None of her guardians had liked her back then. Her father didn't care. She was alone. Desperately, crushingly alone. She had always prided herself on living for herself, on not needing anyone. But now, knowing what it felt like to have someone she could count on, she felt she couldn't live like she used to anymore, yet she would never be so dumb as to allow someone close to her ever again. Because she knew that she would eventually mess everything up, just like she did with Shinji. She wanted to cry, again, on the dirty floor of this empty train station, but managed to swallow back the tears and the lump in her throat after clenching her eyes shut and taking a few deep breaths.  
在德国也是如此。那时她的监护人没有一个喜欢她。她的父亲漠不关心。她孤身一人。绝望而沉重地孤独着。她一直以自力更生、不依赖任何人而自豪。但如今，体验过有人可以依靠的感觉后，她觉得自己再也无法像以前那样生活了，然而她也绝不会再愚蠢到让任何人接近自己。因为她知道，最终她会把一切都搞砸，就像她对真嗣所做的那样。她想再次在这空荡荡的火车站肮脏的地板上哭泣，但紧闭双眼、深呼吸几次后，她还是咽回了泪水和喉咙里的哽咽。  
  
  
  
"I can't blame him from running away. I know I would have." She said to the emptiness around her. "Who would want to be with someone as worthless as me ?" She chuckled humorlessly. "I didn't even have to tell him I got fired for him to figure out he would be much better without me... I lost everything. And it's all my fault." A single tear that she couldn't hold back escaped her left eye.  
“我不能怪他逃跑。我知道我也会这么做。”她对着周围的空旷说道。“谁会想和一个像我这样无用的人在一起呢？”她自嘲地笑了笑。“我甚至不必告诉他我被解雇了，他就明白没有我会更好……我失去了所有。这都是我的错。”她左眼无法抑制的一滴泪水滑落下来。

A/N : This chapter was really interesting to write. My first real battle ! I hope I did a good job ! On that note, I've always felt like this battle was kinda lazy in canon. Asuka gets punched once or twice and ejects. I understand that the scenario needed Shinji to be alone but hey ! It's Asuka we're talking about. She dived into a volcano to prove everyone that she was the best (among other reasons) and she charged an Angel head first after both her arms had been severed. She doesn't run away from a fight !  
作者笔记：这一章写起来真的很有趣。我的第一场真正的战斗！希望我做得不错！说到这里，我一直觉得原作中的这场战斗有点敷衍。明日香被揍了一两下就弹射出去了。我理解剧情需要让真嗣独自面对，但别忘了，我们说的是明日香。她曾跳进火山来证明自己是最好的（还有其他原因），而且在双臂被切断后还迎头冲向使徒。她可不是会逃避战斗的人！  
  
  
  
I would have loved to add some more German here and there, but I don't speak German at all and I didn't want to make any mistakes.  
我很想在这里那里加点德语，但我根本不会德语，也不想犯错。  
  
  
  
As always, if you have anything to say, advice or anything, don't hesitate ! And most importantly, thanks for reading !  
一如既往，如果你有什么想说的，建议或任何事情，尽管提出来！最重要的是，感谢你的阅读！

### Chapter 10 : In the Colosseum

And there we go ! Finally a new chapter ! I don't have much to say, so enjoy !  
好了！终于迎来新章节了！没什么多说的，尽情享受吧！  
  
  
  
  
  
"Where's Asuka ?" Shinji was feeling ambivalent about this Angel attack. On the one hand, he was apprehensive of the fight that was to take place in the near future, as he always was when he had to get inside his entry-plug, and on the other he could barely wait to see Asuka. It had been two nights since she had stormed out of the apartment and he starting to really miss her. This Angel almost seemed like a blessing in disguise to him since it meant that he would finally be able to see her again. He had no idea of how it would go or what he would do or say, but he was determined to do anything in order for her to forgive him. 'Boyfriend...' This word kept repeating in his mind 'I was her boyfriend.' He thought with melancholy.  
"明日香在哪儿？" 真嗣对这次使徒袭击感到矛盾。一方面，他对即将到来的战斗感到忧虑，每次进入插入栓时他总是如此；另一方面，他几乎迫不及待想见到明日香。自从她两天前愤然离开公寓后，他开始真正地想念她。这个使徒对他来说几乎像是因祸得福，因为它意味着他终于能再次见到她了。他不知道事情会如何发展，也不知道自己该做什么或说什么，但他决心尽一切努力让她原谅自己。'男朋友...'这个词在他脑海中反复回响，'我是她的男朋友。'他带着忧郁想道。  
  
  
  
He was thus sitting in his entry-plug. His Eva had been positioned inside the Geofront, directly next to the Headquarters. He was wielding a pallet rifle, his right hand feeling a little numb because of the wound his Eva had sustained and which was not completely healed yet. Every second seemed to last a lifetime. It was far too unusual to be deployed below the surface, something was very wrong, and the briefing didn't tell him a lot about what was happening. He was shivering a little with anticipation. Or maybe angst was really to blame.  
他就这样坐在插入栓里。他的 Eva 被安置在 Geofront 内，紧邻总部。他手持一把托盘步枪，右手因 Eva 所受的伤尚未完全愈合而感到有些麻木。每一秒都似乎漫长无比。在地表下部署实在太过反常，情况肯定不对劲，而简报并没有告诉他太多正在发生的事情。他因期待而微微颤抖。或许真正的原因是焦虑。  
  
  
  
"Miss Soryu is no longer a member of NERV." The cold voice of his father declared.  
"碇司令宣布道，声音冷酷无情。  
  
  
  
"What do you mean she's no longer a member of NERV ? You fired her !?" Shinji retorted, not believing his ears. "Are you stupid !?" The rhetorical question came without him even realizing, living with Asuka sure had left an impression on him. "She's the best Pilot among the three of us !" He said angrily, forgetting about Toji.  
"你说她不再是 NERV 的成员是什么意思？你解雇了她！？" 真嗣反驳道，不敢相信自己的耳朵。"你疯了吗！？" 这个问题脱口而出，他自己都没意识到，和明日香一起生活确实给他留下了深刻印象。"她是咱们三个中最好的驾驶员！" 他愤怒地说道，忘记了东治。  
  
  
  
"I do not have to justify myself to you. But if you really want to know, she is too unstable for us to risk everyone's safety. Her reckless behavior made her a liability."  
"我不需要向你证明自己。但如果你真想知道，她太不稳定，我们无法拿所有人的安全冒险。她的鲁莽行为让她成了累赘。"  
  
  
  
"I shouldn't be surprised." Shinji said flatly, his anger giving him confidence. He was overwhelmed by what he had just learned and its implications. Now it made sense to him why Asuka had been upset last time they saw each other, and why he hadn't seen her since. He wanted to slap himself for not having insisted when she told him she hated him. For not following her when she stormed out of the apartment. He should have stood his ground and insisted on knowing what was on her mind. 'I should have been there for her.' He thought bitterly before focusing back on the present, deciding not to delve on it just yet, there were more pressing matters at the moment. "We beat the last Angel ! She saved Toji ! He would have been killed if she hadn't been there ! You have punished her because she's done the right thing !" He was about to continue lashing out his father when an explosion brought his focus back to the battle. He was now very angry, and decided to use this anger against the Angel which had just appeared above him.  
"我不该感到惊讶。" 真嗣冷冷地说道，愤怒给了他勇气。他刚刚得知的消息及其含义让他感到不知所措。现在他明白了为什么上次见面时明日香会那么难过，以及为什么自那以后他再也没见过她。他真想扇自己一巴掌，因为她告诉他恨他时，他没有坚持问清楚；她冲出公寓时，他没有追上去。他本该坚定立场，坚持要知道她的心事。'我本该在她身边。'他苦涩地想着，然后重新集中注意力于当下，决定暂时不去深究，眼前有更紧迫的事情。"我们打败了最后的使徒！她救了阿薰！如果不是她，他早就死了！你却因为她做了正确的事而惩罚她！" 他正要继续向父亲发泄怒火，一声爆炸将他的注意力拉回到战斗中。他现在非常愤怒，决定利用这份愤怒对抗刚刚出现在他上方的使徒。

Asuka had left the station and had walked to the closest shelter automatically, almost like a robot. She could see it a few dozen meters away. She could also see Unit 01 further away, and in the same automatic way, she passed by the shelter and kept on walking towards the Evangelion. Towards Shinji.  
明日香已经离开车站，几乎是像机器人一样自动地走向最近的避难所。她能看到它就在几十米外。她还能看到更远处的初号机，同样以这种自动的方式，她经过避难所，继续向着那台福音战士走去。向着真嗣走去。  
  
  
  
"What are you doing there kiddo ?" Kaji said while she was walking a few meters away from him. He had his left hand in his pocket and was holding a watering can with his other hand.  
“你在那儿干嘛呢，小家伙？”当她从他身边走过几米时，加持说道。他左手插在口袋里，右手拿着一个喷水壶。  
  
  
  
Asuka didn't seem surprised by the display in front of her, it had been as if she had woken from a trance. She had walked towards the Headquarters without even thinking about it, and arrived right at Kaji's secret garden. He was there, not in a shelter, but then again, neither was she. "I've been fired, in case you didn't know." She said sarcastically. "And if I'm going to die today, it certainly won't be in one of these shelters !" She recovered quickly, hiding her true reason.  
明日香对眼前的景象似乎并不感到惊讶，仿佛她从恍惚中醒来。她不知不觉地走向总部，径直来到了加持的秘密花园。他在那里，没有躲在避难所里，不过话说回来，她也没有。“我被解雇了，如果你还不知道的话。”她讽刺地说道，“如果我今天要死，那肯定不会是在这些避难所里！”她迅速恢复了镇定，隐藏了真正的理由。  
  
  
  
"And you want to see how Shinji's faring." Kaji simply said, seeing clearly through her facade, still watering his melons. They could see Unit 01 standing still in the distance, partially hidden by the pine trees standing in the way, a pallet rifle in its hands, its right wrist still bandaged from the previous fight.  
"“你想看看真嗣的状况。”加持简单地说道，看穿了她的伪装，依旧在给他的瓜果浇水。他们可以看到 01 号机静静地站在远处，部分被挡在路中间的松树后面，手中拿着一把托盘步枪，右腕仍缠着上次战斗留下的绷带。”  
  
  
  
"... We... Things didn't end well between us... I messed everything up. Big surprise right ?" She answered despondently, still transfixed by the purple giant.  
"“……我们……我们之间的事情没有好结果……我把一切都搞砸了。很意外吧？”她沮丧地回答，依旧凝视着那紫色的巨人。”  
  
  
  
"You didn't talk to him since ?" He asked, already knowing the answer.  
"“你从那以后就没和他谈过吗？”他问，已经知道答案。”  
  
  
  
"I couldn't. Not after what I did..." She didn't sound at all like she was supposed to. Even her demeanor was different, Kaji noticed. Her whole body language made her looked downcast, almost resigned. The fact that she wasn't wearing her neural connectors was what stood out more to the man next to her. "Besides, he's better off without me." At this precise moment, a huge explosion rocked the Geofront. They both staggered but didn't even try to take cover. Soon after, the grotesque form of the Angel appeared from the breach it had created. It looked more or less humanoid, with a disproportionately large black and white torso compared to its limbs. Its arms looked like paper ribbons, far too short to be used effectively in combat. At its center was a red sphere, its core. A stone-like mask adorned the top of its torso, locked in an eerie grimace. It descended slowly from the chasm, taking its time to approach its objective.  
"我做不到。在我做了那些事之后……"她的声音完全不像平时的她。连她的举止都变了，加持注意到了。她的整个身体语言让她看起来沮丧，几乎像是认命了。对她来说，最显眼的是她没有佩戴神经连接器。"再说，没有我他会更好。"就在这时，地底都市发生了巨大的爆炸。两人都踉跄了一下，但都没有试图寻找掩护。紧接着，天使的怪异形态从它制造的裂口中出现。它大致呈人形，但躯干黑白分明且异常庞大，与四肢不成比例。它的手臂像纸带一样，短得无法在战斗中有效使用。在其中心是一个红色的球体，即核心。躯干顶部装饰着一块石头般的面具，保持着一种诡异的狞笑。它从裂缝中缓缓降下，不紧不慢地接近目标。  
  
  
  
It then disappeared in a cloud of smoke as Shinji fired its weapon. The noise was excruciatingly loud, and amplified by the Geofront acting as a gigantic sound box. When the gun stopped firing, Asuka wasn't expecting to see the smoke dissipate as Unit 01 didn't try to shoot the Angel anymore. Shinji had remembered his fight against the fourth Angel, when a cloud of smoke that he was responsible for gave his enemy the advantage over him. Hence, he stopped firing and studied his enemy for some time. She thought about what she would have done, emptying magazine after magazine at the Angel, eroding its AT Field at the same time to weaken it from a distance.  
随后，它在一团烟雾中消失，那是真嗣启动了武器。噪音震耳欲聋，被地底都市这个巨大的共鸣箱放大。枪声停止后，明日香没想到会看到烟雾散去，因为初号机没有继续向使徒射击。真嗣记起了他与第四使徒的战斗，当时他制造的烟雾让敌人占了上风。因此，他停止射击，仔细观察敌人。她思考着自己会怎么做，不断向使徒倾泻弹药，同时削弱其 AT 力场，从远处削弱它。  
  
  
  
"Is that really what you think ?" Kaji resumed their conversation as if nothing had happened, scratching his scruffy chin with his free hand.  
“你真是这么想的吗？”加持继续他们的对话，仿佛什么都没发生，用空着的手挠了挠胡子拉碴的下巴。  
  
  
  
"Of course not !" Asuka blurted out before she could filter her answer. The exhaustion of the past few days was taking its toll on her. "It felt nice to be able to count on someone. But I screwed it up..." As she said that, Unit 01 drew its progressive knife. "It doesn't matter now anyway. He probably hates me now... I could probably coerce him into staying with me, but that would just be selfish..." She trailed off. 'And I'd only hurt him in the end.'  
“当然不是！” 明日香脱口而出，没来得及过滤自己的回答。过去几天的疲惫正在对她产生影响。“能依靠某人感觉很好。但我搞砸了……” 说着，零号机拔出了它的渐进刀。“现在无论如何都没关系了。他现在可能恨我……我也许可以强迫他留在我身边，但那只是自私……” 她渐渐停了下来。‘最终我只会伤害他。’  
  
  
  
"You've changed. You've grown so much in the last few weeks." He stated, proud of his former ward.  
“你变了。过去几周你成长了很多。” 他自豪地说道，看着他曾经的监护人。  
  
  
  
"I hate it ! Things were so much easier when I thought I could live only for myself ! I feel like I failed myself !" Her fire was coming back to her as she spoke. She wasn't being completely honest, of course, but at least her outburst meant that she wasn't defeated yet. She might have been stripped bare of her status, of her title, of her Eva, but nobody could rid her of her pride ! The Angel and Unit 01 were now looking at each other, studying each other, waiting for the other to move first.  
“我讨厌这样！当我以为我可以只为自己而活时，事情简单多了！我感觉我辜负了自己！” 随着她说话，她的怒火又回来了。当然，她并没有完全说实话，但至少她的爆发意味着她还没有被打败。她可能失去了地位、头衔、Eva，但没有人能夺走她的骄傲！天使和零号机现在正相互对视，互相研究，等待对方先行动。  
  
  
  
"Don't think of it that way. You haven't failed, you have learned."  
"别这么想。你没有失败，你只是学到了东西。"  
  
  
  
"And just what the hell did I learn !?" She spat out. "I already knew that living just by myself was less painful than this !"  
"那我到底学到了什么鬼东西！？" 她愤愤地说道。"我早就知道，一个人生活比这痛苦少多了！"  
  
  
  
"You've learned that you can be more than just an Eva Pilot. And that you don't have to be alone. That there are people out there who care, I mean genuinely care about you." He stated, looking at Unit 01 for a few seconds.  
"你学会了你不仅仅是 EVA 驾驶员。而且你不必孤单一人。外面有人关心你，我是说真心关心你。" 他说着，目光在初号机上停留了几秒。"  
  
  
  
"And what good does it make ?" Asuka asked, fuming, turning to face her interlocutor. For the first time since they had started talking, she had managed to pry her eyes off Unit 01. She missed as a consequence the Angel throwing its ribbon arm at the Eva, who barely dodged it before taking a defensive stance a fair distance away from its foe. "After the battle is over I'll be escorted back to the station so I can be shipped back to Germany !" She was torn between anger and despair.  
"“那有什么用？”明日香怒气冲冲地问道，转身面对她的对话者。这是自他们开始交谈以来，她第一次设法将目光从零一单位上移开。因此，她错过了使徒用其带状手臂向 Eva 发起攻击的瞬间，Eva 勉强躲开后，在距离敌人相当远的地方采取了防御姿态。“战斗结束后，我会被护送回基地，然后被送回德国！”她既愤怒又绝望。”  
  
  
  
"If we survive." Unit 00 emerged from the ground at this moment, a sonic glaive in its only hand, since its left arm wasn't regenerated yet. Rei gave the weapon to Shinji who tried to close the gap between him and the Angel to attack it with his now longer range. Rei stayed back and picked up one of the many weapons which were laid close to Unit 01's position, a rocket launcher, and fired some distraction shots at the Angel. "It's said if an Angel makes contact with Adam, who lies below here, humanity will be eradicated. The Third Impact." Shinji barely avoided a ribbon coming for him by lunging forward while ducking. Slowly but surely, he was getting closer to his target.  
"“如果我们能活下来。”此时，零零单位从地面冒出，仅有的右手握着一把音速长枪，因为它的左臂尚未再生。绫波将武器交给真嗣，后者试图缩短与使徒之间的距离，以利用其现在更长的攻击范围。绫波留在后方，捡起靠近零一单位位置的众多武器之一——火箭发射器，并向使徒发射了几枚干扰弹。“据说如果使徒与这里的亚当接触，人类将会被灭绝。第三次冲击。”真嗣险些避开向他袭来的带状物，俯身前冲。他正缓慢但坚定地接近目标。”  
  
  
  
Asuka turned her gaze back to the battle before her, silently cheering and encouraging Shinji. "Don't worry about it, he's the Invincible Shinji, he can't lose !" She said dismissively. "He'll kick this Angel's a-Shinji ! Duck !" She shouted as the Angel threw another of his ribbons at Unit 01 who managed to dodge it by quickly moving right, only to arrive directly in the path of the Angel's second ribbon. As if he had heard Asuka's command, he ducked and avoided the attack, however, his umbilical cable didn't. Both ends of the cable erupted in a fountain of sparks as they were cleanly cut off. Unit 01 staggered for a second, as if Shinji had let doubt overcome him until it started moving again, just in time to raise its glaive in front of its face to protect himself from the ribbon thrown by the Angel, which connected with tremendous force against the blade, cutting itself through all its length on the weapon. One of the halves hit Unit 01's left shoulder pylon, severing it with its momentum before falling limp on the ground behind the Eva, useless.  
明日香将目光转回眼前的战斗，默默地为真嗣加油鼓劲。“别担心，他是无敌的真嗣，不会输的！”她不以为意地说道。“他会把这个使徒踢飞的，真嗣！快躲开！”她喊道，只见使徒再次甩出一条缎带，初号机迅速向右闪避，却恰好迎上了使徒的第二条缎带。仿佛听见了明日香的指令，真嗣俯身躲过了攻击，然而脐带电缆却没有幸免。电缆两端火花四溅，被干净利落地切断。初号机踉跄了一下，似乎真嗣被疑虑所困扰，但很快又重新动了起来，及时举起长柄刀挡在面前，抵御使徒投来的缎带，缎带以巨大的力量撞击在刀刃上，沿着武器的长度自断成两截。其中一半击中了初号机左肩的支架，凭借其势头将其切断，然后无力地坠落在 Eva 身后的地面上，变得毫无用处。  
  
  
  
"Asuka, the only thing I can do is stand here and water." Kaji said, not paying any attention to the battle or the girl tensing up next to him. "But you, you have something that you can do. That only you can do." With only one usable arm, the Angel was now less efficient when attacking, and as a consequence, less threatening. Unable to focus on both targets at the same time, it seemed overwhelmed by the two Evangelions fighting it. "If you both die, at least he'll know that you had his back until the end..." The Angel was getting attacked more and more relentlessly now, until it stopped focusing on Unit 01. It turned to face the other Eva as its eyes started to glow, taking the two Pilots by surprise. A second after, a gigantic explosion rocked the inside of the Geofront and engulfed Unit 00. When the smoke cleared, the blue Evangelion was motionless, silent, lying down on the ground several hundred meters from its previous position, its armor melted on the front because of the explosion. Shinji seemed stunned, as Unit 01 didn't do anything for several agonizing seconds. "And if you survive, you'll be able to talk to him. He might not forgive you, especially for not telling him about you leaving Japan... But you owe it to him... To the both you." Shinji had retreated to the laying form of Unit 00 to put it on its side and grab its umbilical cable. Its entry-plug ejected as soon as it could, propelling itself away from the battle.  
"明日香，我能做的只有站在这里浇水。" 加持说道，对战斗或身旁紧绷的少女毫不在意。"但你，你有你能做的事，只有你能做的事。" 仅剩一只可用手臂的使徒，攻击效率大减，威胁也随之降低。无法同时专注于两个目标，它在两台 EVA 的夹击下显得力不从心。"如果你们都牺牲了，至少他会知道，你直到最后都与他并肩作战……" 使徒遭受的攻击愈发猛烈，直至它不再关注初号机，转而面对另一台 EVA，眼中光芒闪烁，令两位驾驶员措手不及。紧接着，地底都市内部爆发出巨大爆炸，零号机被吞没其中。烟尘散去后，蓝色 EVA 静止不动，沉默地躺在距离原位置数百米的地面上，前装甲因爆炸而熔化。真嗣似乎愣住了，初号机在令人煎熬的几秒内毫无动作。"而如果你幸存下来，你将有机会与他交谈。 他或许不会原谅你，尤其是你离开日本却未告知他的事……但你欠他一个交代……对你们俩都是。" 真嗣退到零号机的躺卧形态旁，将其侧翻并抓住脐带电缆。驾驶舱随即尽可能快地弹出，自行远离战场。  
  
  
  
"You're right. Thanks, Kaji..." She trailed off for a few seconds. "And thanks for not doing anything on the Over the Rainbow. A lesser man wouldn't have been able to resist... But seriously, I'm sorry... For everything." Asuka said, not daring to look him in the eyes, though her feelings of weakness and shame from the apology were nothing compared to the determination and excitement she felt for the battles she was about to fight. First, she had to somehow get back inside her Eva, then she had to destroy this Angel. With its new source of power, Unit 01 resumed its assault. Shinji was fighting like a demon, Unit 01 was, if not gracefully, efficiently dodging every attack sent its way and getting closer and closer to its target. Maybe he wouldn't need her at all. Maybe nothing would change. She put those thoughts at the back of her mind for the time being. It was no use worrying about this right now, she wasn't even sure they, or rather _he_, would let her pilot anyway.  
"你说得对。谢谢你，加持..." 她顿了几秒。"还有，谢谢你在彩虹桥上什么都没做。换作别人可能就忍不住了... 但说真的，我很抱歉... 为所有的事。" 明日香说道，不敢直视他的眼睛，尽管她的软弱和羞愧感在道歉中显得微不足道，与她即将面对的战斗所激发的决心和兴奋相比。首先，她得设法回到她的 Eva 里，然后她必须摧毁这个使徒。随着新动力源的注入，01 号机重新发起攻击。真嗣如同恶魔般战斗着，01 号机虽不优雅但高效地躲避着每一次攻击，一步步逼近目标。也许他根本不需要她。也许一切都不会改变。她暂时将这些念头抛诸脑后。现在担心这些毫无意义，她甚至不确定他们，或者说他，是否会允许她驾驶。  
  
  
  
Kaji let out a small understanding smile. "Go." He didn't have to say anything more. He perfectly knew what she meant, and what it meant to her to say those words. Asuka ran like she never ran before. The entrance to the Geofront wasn't very far from Kaji's garden, but every second counted. She wasn't paying attention to the battle anymore, already focusing on getting to him, she was getting excited at the prospect of showing him that she still had his back. Huge cracking and slicing noises almost made her stop to look behind her but she refused to waste precious time, trying to mentally block the noises of crashes around her in order to reach the entrance as quickly as possible, using this short run to clear her head and prepare herself mentally.  
加持露出了一个会意的微笑。“去吧。”他无需多言。他完全明白她的意思，以及她说出这些话对她意味着什么。明日香如离弦之箭般疾驰而去。通往地底都市的入口离加持的花园并不远，但每一秒都至关重要。她不再关注战场，全神贯注于奔向他，一想到能向他证明自己依然在他身边，她就兴奋不已。巨大的断裂与切割声几乎让她停下脚步回头张望，但她拒绝浪费宝贵的时间，试图在心中屏蔽周围的撞击声，以便尽快抵达入口，利用这段短暂的奔跑来理清思绪并做好心理准备。

Things were getting dire in the Command Center. Everyone was trying their best not to panic. Even Fuyutsuki, behind his impassible stance, was feeling rather uneasy. Ritsuko was furiously typing on a computer next to Maya which was trying her best just to keep up with her sempai. But despite their best efforts, Unit 02 wouldn't accept the Dummy Plug. Ritsuko had tried to explain that Dr. Soryu's failed contact experiment and subsequent split of her soul made the synchronization with the Dummy plug too erratic to make Unit 02 usable in combat to Gendo. At times, the sync ratio was completely acceptable, but it never lasted long. With no apparent reason to people who didn't know the inner workings of an Evangelion, it dipped below the activation threshold, then reactivated, without regularity or any kind of pattern. The consequence was that the Eva deactivated in the middle of an action for several seconds, then reactivated and so on and so forth, so it would be completely useless against the Angel. But the Commander had given the order. The Dummy Plug had to synchronize with Unit 02, so Ritsuko and Maya were trying to find a way to circumvent this major setback. The constant headache Ritsuko was dealing with since she got injured in the explosion of the Matsushiro Experiment Facility didn't help.  
指挥中心内的气氛愈发紧张。每个人都竭力避免陷入恐慌。即便是外表冷静的冬月，内心也颇感不安。律子在真嗣身旁疯狂地敲击着键盘，而真嗣则努力跟上她的节奏。然而，尽管他们竭尽全力，二号机就是无法接受模拟插入栓。律子曾试图向源堂解释，由于碇唯博士的接触实验失败及其灵魂的分裂，导致二号机与模拟插入栓的同步率极不稳定，无法在战斗中使用。有时，同步率完全在可接受范围内，但持续时间极短。对于不了解 EVA 内部运作的人来说，这一现象毫无规律可循，时而低于激活阈值，时而又重新激活，毫无规律可言。结果是，EVA 在行动中会突然停机数秒，然后又重新启动，如此反复，使其在对抗使徒时完全失去作用。但司令已经下达了命令。模拟插入栓必须与二号机同步，因此律子和真嗣正试图找到绕过这一重大障碍的方法。 自从在松代实验设施的爆炸中受伤以来，Ritsuko 一直忍受的持续性头痛并没有任何缓解。  
  
  
  
Toji was in the entry-plug, desperately trying as well to synchronize with the red giant, but his lack of training made it clear that he wouldn't succeed. That he wouldn't be able to help his friend. He would have probably been able to do something in his own Eva, but it was far from being repaired, and still under quarantine. Gendo had no intention of using him in the first place, he had expected the Dummy Plug to easily sync with Unit 02. But desperate times call for desperate measures, so he had been ordered to get into Unit 02. Toji still tried as much as he could to do something. He hated the helplessness he felt while hearing Shinji's enraged screams through the comm channel.  
Toji 坐在插入栓内，拼命尝试与红色巨人同步，但由于缺乏训练，显然他无法成功。他无法帮助他的朋友。如果是在他自己的 Eva 里，他或许还能做些什么，但那台 Eva 远未修复，仍处于隔离状态。Gendo 原本无意使用他，他预期 Dummy Plug 能轻易与 02 号机同步。但危急时刻需要采取非常措施，因此他被命令进入 02 号机。Toji 仍然尽其所能地尝试做些什么。他讨厌在通讯频道中听到 Shinji 愤怒的尖叫时所感受到的无助。  
  
  
  
Things were not going according to plan, so Gendo was bracing himself for a Third Impact which would not be on his own terms. Maybe he would still be reunited with Yui. His theorizations came to a halt when he heard sounds which didn't fit with the situation. He seemed to hear people cheering in the Eva cage below. He stopped pacing in the Eva's control room and turned towards the source of these unexpected noises. "Why are you here ?" He said upon noticing the reason of this joyfulness.  
事情并未按计划进行，因此碇源堂正准备迎接一个不由他掌控的第三次冲击。或许他仍能与唯重逢。当他听到与当前情况不符的声音时，他的推测戛然而止。他似乎听到下方的 EVA 格纳库中传来人们的欢呼声。他在 EVA 控制室中停止踱步，转向这些意外声响的来源。“你们为何在此？”他注意到这欢乐的原因后问道。  
  
  
  
The entry-plug slid out of the Evangelion and its hatch opened, revealing Toji who jumped on the gangway next to him to watch the scene unfolding before his eyes.  
插入栓从 EVA 中滑出，舱门打开，露出东治，他跳到旁边的舷梯上，注视着眼前展开的场景。  
  
  
  
"I am the Pilot of Evangelion Unit 02 ! I am Asuka Langley Soryu !" She shouted with determination and defiance. She knew that if he had been capable of launching her Eva without her, he would have done it by now. So for whatever reason, he needed her. A sardonic smile appeared on her lips.  
“我是 EVA 二号机的驾驶员！我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷！”她坚定而挑衅地喊道。她知道，如果他能不靠她就启动她的 EVA，早就这么做了。所以无论出于何种原因，他需要她。一丝讽刺的微笑浮现在她的唇边。  
  
  
  
She ran to the entry-plug without even waiting for the Commander to accept what was happening. Toji waited for her to be close enough to speak. "Well, looks like nobody can make this pile of junk move but you, Devil ! Even their damn autopilot didn't work !.. It's good to see you." He said with a genuine smile on his face, probably the first one he ever directed her.  
她不等指挥官接受眼前发生的一切，就跑向了插入栓。真嗣等着她靠近到可以说话的距离。“好吧，看来除了你这恶魔，没人能让这堆废铁动起来！就连他们的该死自动驾驶也没用！……见到你真好。”他脸上带着真诚的笑容说道，这可能是他第一次对她露出这样的笑容。  
  
  
  
"I'll show you how it's done, scrub !" She answered with a smile of her own, with no real aggression towards her usurper, already climbing inside the plug.  
“我会让你看看该怎么做，菜鸟！”她带着自己的微笑回答，对这位篡位者并无真正的敌意，已经爬进了插入栓。  
  
  
  
One of the techs caught up to them as they were talking and almost ceremoniously offered her a new set of A10 hair clips which she quickly put in their rightful place. "Thanks for coming back. We really needed you." He timidly said before leaving almost faster than he arrived. Most of the techs admired the Pilots of the Evas they were assigned to, this one was no exception.  
他们交谈时，一名技术人员赶了上来，几乎是仪式性地递给她一套新的 A10 发夹，她迅速将其放回原位。“谢谢你回来。我们真的很需要你。”他怯生生地说完，几乎比来时更快地离开了。大多数技术人员都钦佩他们所负责的 EVA 驾驶员，这位也不例外。  
  
  
  
"Go kick its ass !" Toji managed to add before the entry-plug sealed shut and slid inside Unit 02's neck. When the activation sequence started, Asuka felt something. She felt the connection between her and her Eva like never before. It felt clearer, more direct. When the walls of the entry-plug showed her the outside world, she was ready.  
"去踢它的屁股！" 真嗣在插入栓封闭并滑入二号机颈部之前勉强喊道。当启动程序开始时，明日香感受到了某种变化。她与 Eva 之间的联系前所未有地清晰，更加直接。当插入栓的屏幕向她展示外界时，她已做好准备。

Panic was now clearly etched on the face of every person present in the Command Center. And it had been spreading like wildfire in the entire Headquarters since Misato had ordered all personnel to be evacuated. It had been breached, and the attacker had promptly reached the Command Center. Everyone looked in horror at the Angel when its eyes started to glow threateningly. Time seemed to stop, silence seemed to envelop her as she closed her eyes and took her cross in her right hand, her left arm still in a cast, and prepared as much as she could for her impending fate. A deafening noise broke the silence in her mind and all the alarms resumed blaring in her ears. She opened her eyes just in time to catch a glimpse of a red blur punching the Angel away from them. Her brain kicked back into gear almost immediately as she realized what was happening. "Unit 02 !? Asuka !"  
指挥中心内的每个人都面露惊恐之色，恐慌自美里下令全员撤离后便如野火般在整个总部蔓延开来。防线已被突破，攻击者迅速逼近指挥中心。当使徒的双眼开始威胁性地闪烁时，所有人都惊恐地盯着它。她闭上眼睛，右手紧握十字架，左臂仍打着石膏，尽可能地为即将到来的命运做好准备。一阵震耳欲聋的声响打破了她内心的寂静，所有警报再次在她耳边响起。她睁开眼睛，恰巧看到一团红色身影将使徒击退。她的思维几乎立刻恢复运转，意识到发生了什么。“二号机！？明日香！”  
  
  
  
The only answer she got was a furious scream from the German girl. She had been feeling powerless and sorry for herself for the past two days, but not anymore. Her confrontation with the Commander had just been an appetizer, and this fight was the main course. As soon as she had carved herself a passage to the Command Center and seen the Angel, she let her rage lead her actions. She wasn't in her entry-plug to save humanity right now, she was there to kill. Her pent-up frustration over the last days now only served to fuel her ire. This Angel was going to die. All it could do would only postpone the ineluctable. The red Eva punched its enemy repeatedly before pushing it against the wall on the other side of the room, destroying it as well in the process. All crew members let out a sigh of relief as the threat was moved away from them.  
她得到的唯一回应是德国女孩愤怒的尖叫。过去的两天里，她一直感到无力和自怜，但如今不再如此。与指挥官的对峙不过是前菜，这场战斗才是正餐。一打通前往指挥中心的通道并见到使徒，她便任由怒火驱使行动。此刻她不是为了拯救人类而坐在插入栓里，而是为了杀戮。连日来的压抑情绪此刻只助长了她的怒火。这个使徒必死无疑。它所做的一切不过是拖延不可避免的命运。红色 EVA 反复击打敌人，随后将其推向房间另一侧的墙壁，过程中也摧毁了那堵墙。所有乘员都松了一口气，威胁已远离他们。  
  
  
  
The Angel stumbled and fell on its back in the empty Eva cage. Asuka, carried by her momentum fell on top of it. She raised her Eva's fist in order to punch the Angel again. A light emanated from its eyes but Asuka had seen this attack on the surface, she quickly dodged to the right thanks to her instinct and combat training. The laser only managed to hit the ceiling, making debris fall over Unit 02. Asuka should have been stunned by the huge chunks of metal and concrete falling on her back and head, however, in this state, nothing could stop her. She stumbled a little when she stood back up because of the rubble on the ground and the weight of the Angel that she was pulling with her by its face. Its "neck" stretched a little before the rest of its body followed the movement.  
天使在空荡的 Eva 笼中踉跄倒地，仰面朝天。被惯性带着的明日香随之压在其上。她举起 Eva 的拳头，准备再次击打天使。天使眼中射出光芒，但明日香曾在地面上见识过这一招，凭借本能和战斗训练，她迅速向右闪避。激光仅击中了天花板，碎片如雨般落在二号机上。按理说，巨型金属和混凝土块砸在背上和头上，明日香本该被震得晕头转向，然而此刻，她无所畏惧。起身时因地面碎石和拖拽天使面部的重量而略显蹒跚。天使的“脖子”稍稍拉长，随后整个身体也跟着移动。  
  
  
  
She punched it again a few times for good measure when it was standing. Asuka wondered for a brief second if this was the same Angel she had seen while talking to Kaji. It didn't react, it didn't try to fight back. She focused back on her objective and pushed it as far as she could, against the wall of an Eva lift. "Misato !" It had been the only intelligible sound erupting from her mouth since she had joined the fight. It had been unnecessary, since the Major had already given the order to launch the catapult. She maintained the Angel's face against the steel rail all the way up to the top, making sparks erupt from the friction. "Hey Third ! You and I will have a talk once this is over !" She didn't really want to sound threatening, but her actual mindset made it impossible to sound any other way. She was determined, angry. She wanted to show the Commander that she could not be that easily replaced. That he had made a mistake. That he needed her to win this war.  
她又在站立的使徒身上补了几拳，确保万无一失。明日香短暂地怀疑了一下，这是否就是她和加持谈话时看到的那只使徒。它毫无反应，也没有试图反击。她重新专注于目标，将其推到极限，抵在 EVA 升降机的墙壁上。“美里！”这是她加入战斗以来唯一清晰发出的声音。其实这并不必要，因为美里少校已经下达了发射弹射器的命令。她一直将使徒的脸压在钢轨上，直到顶端，摩擦出的火花四溅。“喂，三号！这事结束后你我得好好谈谈！”她并非真的想威胁，但内心的真实想法让她无法以其他方式表达。她坚定、愤怒。她想向司令证明，自己不是那么容易被替代的。他犯了个错误。他需要她来赢得这场战争。  
  
  
  
The two giants carried their momentum when the lift stopped, projecting them both in the air. She had already started to switch her position, standing over the Angel while still in the air, one foot right on her enemy's core, the other leg bent in order to put the most weight on the first one. She was emulating the position in which she had, with Shinji, literally landed the final blow on the Seventh Angel. It was at this moment, seconds before landing, that she froze. Out of her the corner of her eye first, she saw Unit 01, then she turned her head to make sure what she saw was real. There it was, a few dozen meters away from her, still standing. It had been decapitated. She couldn't concentrate on anything but him anymore. This was the reason why he didn't answer. She desperately wanted to know if he was alright. If he was still alive. With the sync ratio he had managed to attain during the tests, the neural feedback could have given him whiplash, or it could have blocked his trachea, making him choke to death, alone in his entry-plug.  
电梯停止时，两位巨人带着惯性被抛向空中。她已经开始调整姿势，在空中跨立在使徒上方，一脚正踩在敌人的核心上，另一腿弯曲以将最大重量压在第一脚上。她模仿着与真嗣一起，对第七使徒施以致命一击时的落地姿态。就在即将着陆的瞬间，她僵住了。首先从眼角瞥见的是初号机，随后她转头确认所见非虚。就在几十米外，它依然屹立着，尽管已被斩首。她再也无法集中注意力于其他事物。这就是他未回应的原因。她迫切想知道他是否安好，是否还活着。凭借他在测试中达到的同步率，神经反馈可能已让他遭受颈部扭伤，或是阻塞气管，使他在插入栓内窒息而亡。  
  
  
  
She didn't even notice two rock-like appendages emerging from around the Angel's core, encasing it so they were between the core and her Eva's foot. The behemoths crashed on the ground not far from Unit 01's beheaded form. Unit 02 lost its stance and tumbled away from the Angel, destroying the landscape in its way. The fall put Asuka out of her daze, and she turned her attention back to the Angel with renewed anger, swearing and threatening loudly her foe in German. She launched her Eva head first towards the Angel, tackling it to the ground before punching it again.  
她甚至未曾察觉两根岩石般的附肢从使徒的核心周围伸出，将其包裹起来，使它们位于核心与她的 Eva 脚之间。巨兽们坠落在不远处，就在零一机无头形态的附近。零二机失去了平衡，从使徒身边翻滚开去，沿途破坏了地貌。这一摔让明日香从恍惚中清醒过来，她重新将注意力转向使徒，带着更甚的怒火，用德语大声咒骂并威胁着她的敌人。她操控 Eva 头部朝前冲向使徒，将其撞倒在地，随即再次挥拳猛击。  
  
  
  
She was boiling with rage, hitting it with all her might when suddenly, the walls of her entry-plug turned black. "No !" She shouted as she understood what happened. No more power. She had failed. There was nothing left standing between the Angel and the end of the world. She wouldn't see Shinji again. It was over. In the darkness of her entry-plug, Asuka started to cry once more. She didn't even care when her Eva was thrown away, nor when an explosion rocked her entry-plug. She just let herself get overwhelmed with helplessness, openly sobbing, not paying any attention to her confined surroundings. As time passed, she became more and more aware of loud impacts rocking her entry-plug, interrupting her despondency. The impacts were slow, but relentless, merciless. Some times later, the loud thuds were joined by the noise of something cracking all around her.  
她怒火中烧，用尽全力击打着，突然，插入栓的内壁变得漆黑。“不！”她喊道，意识到发生了什么。电源耗尽，她失败了。再没有任何东西能阻挡使徒和世界的终结。她再也见不到真嗣了。一切结束了。在插入栓的黑暗中，明日香再次哭泣。她甚至不在乎自己的 EVA 被抛弃，也不在意插入栓因爆炸而震动。她任由无助感淹没自己，放声痛哭，对周围狭小的空间毫不在意。随着时间流逝，她越来越能感受到插入栓被沉重撞击所摇晃，打断了她的绝望。撞击虽慢，却无情且残忍。不久后，沉重的撞击声中又加入了四周破裂的声音。  
  
  
  
"No !" She shrieked. She had given up for a moment. Not anymore. She was Asuka Langley Soryu. She did not give up. "I can't lose ! I won't lose !" The hits didn't stop, nor did they increase in speed as she was now yanking furiously her butterfly handles, screaming madly, not caring anymore if anyone could hear her. "Move ! Move gottverdammt ! Move !" The impacts only served to make her more enraged. "Move ! Move ! You have to move !" She thought the Angel was mocking her personally now that she had fallen, humiliating her without honor. "I can't lose ! If I lose then it's all over and I can't let this happen !" The red behemoth didn't move, however. She kept on pushing the butterfly handles desperately, weakly wailing at the same time. Finally, this rollercoaster of emotions of the past days proved to be too much, even for the great Asuka Langley Soryu. She slammed her fist lamely on her right control yoke with a short shout full of anger, frustration and sadness, slouching on her seat.  
“不！”她尖叫道。那一刻她曾放弃过，但不再了。她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，她不会放弃。“我不能输！我不会输！”攻击并未停止，速度也未见提升，她疯狂地猛拉操纵杆，尖叫着，不再在意是否有人能听见。“动啊！该死的动啊！动！”每一次撞击只让她更加愤怒。“动！你必须动！”她觉得天使在她倒下后在嘲弄她，无耻地羞辱她。“我不能输！如果我输了，那就全完了，我不能让这种事发生！”然而，红色的巨兽依旧纹丝不动。她绝望地继续推着操纵杆，同时无力地哀嚎。最终，过去几天的情绪过山车对伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷来说也太过沉重。她无力地一拳砸在右边的控制杆上，短促的喊声充满了愤怒、挫败和悲伤，颓然倒在座位上。  
  
  
  
The weight of her defeat was slowly creeping back to overwhelm her. "Move ! If you don't move we'll all die !" She lamented. "I don't want to die..." She solemnly said, her tears dissolving inside the LCL around her. "...I haven't had the chance to tell him how much he means to me... If we die, he'll never know that I... Love him."  
失败的沉重感慢慢袭来，再次将她淹没。“快动啊！再不动我们都会死！”她哀叹道。“我不想死……”她郑重地说，泪水在周围的 LCL 中消融。“……我还没来得及告诉他他对我有多重要……如果我们死了，他永远不会知道我……爱他。”  
  
  
  
She raised her head, her eyes wide when she heard a thunderous heartbeat. She stayed still when she heard another... Then another... Then another. She was completely paralyzed as her Eva finally answered her plea and awakened. Its four eyes lit up as the top and lower parts of its face mask shifted in order to reveal them. It raised its AT Field to block the next attack of the Angel. The ribbon-like arm was shredded as soon as it made contact with the octagonal barrier, and the reverberation was enough to injure the Angel itself, which crashed on its back while blood poured from the gashes it had just received.  
她抬起头，听到雷鸣般的心跳声时，眼睛睁得大大的。她静止不动，当她听到另一个……然后又一个……再一个。当她的 EVA 终于回应她的恳求并觉醒时，她完全僵住了。它的四只眼睛亮了起来，面罩的上下部分移动以露出它们。它举起 AT 力场阻挡天使的下一波攻击。缎带般的手臂一接触到八角形的屏障就被撕碎，而这种震动足以伤害到天使本身，它仰面倒下，鲜血从刚刚受到的伤口中涌出。  
  
  
  
Unit 02 stood up slowly, taking its time as its threat was neutralized for the time being. It breathed heavily through its mouth then arched and roared powerfully before falling on all fours and making its way towards its fallen foe. It stopped for a few seconds only to bury its fingers in the monster's eyes, preventing it from trying to retaliate with a last, desperate attack.  
02 号机缓缓站起身，趁着威胁暂时解除之际，不紧不慢地行动。它通过嘴巴沉重地呼吸，随后弓起身躯，发出一声有力的咆哮，接着四肢着地，向倒下的敌人走去。它停顿了几秒，只是为了将手指插入怪物的眼睛，阻止其进行最后的绝望反击。  
  
  
  
Unit 02's eyes narrowed in a vicious expression of anticipation. It then lowered its head towards the Angel until it abruptly stopped, its action impeded by some obstacle. It snarled in frustration, then arched back up before grabbing the lower part of its face mask at the chin with both hands before pulling on it with all its strength while roaring ferociously. The bottom of the face mask broke after a few seconds on both sides of the beast's jaw, freeing its mouth. The Eva let out a vicious scream, now unhindered by the restraining mask, its teeth glowing in the artificial light of the Geofront, before resuming its previous action. It started savagely eating the Angel, tearing its flesh, ripping its bones before crunching them in its powerful jaw. The beast suddenly straightened and looked cautiously behind its back before returning to its meal.  
02 号机的双眼眯成一条凶狠的期待之线。随后，它将头低下靠近使徒，却在某处障碍前突然停住。它因挫败而咆哮，然后猛地后仰，双手抓住下巴处的面罩，全力撕扯，同时发出野蛮的怒吼。几秒钟后，面罩底部在巨兽颚部两侧断裂，解放了它的嘴巴。EVA 发出一声凶猛的尖叫，不再受面罩束缚，牙齿在 Geofront 的人造光下闪耀，随即继续先前的行动。它开始野蛮地吞食使徒，撕裂其肉，扯断其骨，再用强力的颚部将其碾碎。巨兽突然挺直身躯，警觉地回头张望，然后又继续它的盛宴。  
  
  
  
The Angel was dead, however Unit 02 was still very much active. It looked around for a few seconds before standing on its hind legs, the armor binding it to humanity's will breaking as the beast's muscles expanded on its arms, torso and back. It roared to the Heavens above as if daring humanity or the Angels, or anything else to try and stop it.  
然而，天使已死，二号机依旧活跃异常。它环顾四周几秒后，便以后腿站立，束缚其服从人类意志的装甲随着野兽手臂、躯干和背部肌肉的膨胀而破裂。它向着天际咆哮，仿佛在挑衅人类、天使或其他任何存在，试图阻止它的步伐。

### Chapter 11 : The world keeps turning

I'm pretty late for this one, sorry about that ! Enjoy !  
我来得有点晚，抱歉！尽情享受吧！  
  
  
  
Day 2 : 第二天：  
  
  
  
I didn't have this notebook yesterday so what I'll just write what happened today. I could have put everything in the same entry but I wanted to relate everything day by day. So this is the day I got out of the hospital. I wasn't seriously injured during the battle, nothing more than some bruises. I spent a day there... Well, more like 30 something hours. I guess I just needed some rest. Mr Kaji came here at the end of the day. I imagine Misato needed someone to babysit me since she wasn't coming home. Too much work she said. It makes sense considering the last battle. She didn't tell me anything about you which is what worries me the most. I know that you came back and that you killed the Angel, but what happened ? Why can't I see you ? Why does nobody want to tell me anything ? Even Mr Kaji seemed worried. We didn't talk much, even I thought the silence was awkward !  
昨天我还没有这本笔记本，所以我会写下今天发生的事情。我本可以把所有内容放在同一个条目里，但我希望按日记录。这是我从医院出来的那天。我在战斗中受的伤并不严重，只是些瘀伤。我在那里待了一天……嗯，更像是三十多个小时。我想我只是需要休息一下。加治先生在那天快结束时来了。我想是因为美里需要有人照顾我，因为她不回家。她说工作太忙了。考虑到上一场战斗，这很合理。她没有告诉我关于你的任何事情，这让我最担心。我知道你回来了，并且你杀死了使徒，但发生了什么？为什么我见不到你？为什么没人愿意告诉我任何事情？甚至连加治先生也显得很担心。我们没怎么说话，连我都觉得沉默很尴尬！  
  
  
  
What happened to you ?  
你怎么了？  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 3 :  第三天：  
  
  
  
Mr Kaji came by again. I guess I'll have to get used to him being here from now on. He just gave me this notebook. He told me to write about what I think, what I feel. And as you can see I am doing just that. I can already see you laugh at my face for obeying orders, just like with the cello... Or the Eva. But it helps, somehow.  
加治先生又来了。我想从现在开始我得习惯他在这里了。他刚给了我这本笔记本。他让我写下我的想法和感受。正如你所见，我正在这么做。我仿佛已经能看到你因为我乖乖听话而嘲笑我的脸，就像对待大提琴...或者 Eva 那样。但不知怎么的，这确实有帮助。  
  
  
  
Misato called me some hours later. Mr Kaji was nice enough not to try and disturb me while I was in my room. She gave me good news... I think. She told me that you were still alive, that you were still in your Eva, but that something happened during the battle. From what I understood, your sync ratio was so high that you got absorbed inside your Eva. So you're still there but you aren't, and you can't leave. Misato told me that Dr Akagi had a plan to get you out, but that it would take some time. I stayed on my bed for hours afterwards I think to try and make sense of it.  
几个小时后，美里给我打了电话。加持先生很体贴，没有试图在我房间里打扰我。她带来了好消息……我想是好消息。她告诉我你还活着，你还在你的 Eva 里，但战斗中发生了一些事情。据我所知，你的同步率太高，以至于你被吸收进了 Eva 内部。所以你还在那里，但你又不在那里，而且你无法离开。美里告诉我，赤木博士有一个计划把你救出来，但需要一些时间。之后我想我在床上躺了几个小时，试图理解这一切。  
  
  
  
I guess this notebook will serve as a way for me to relate to you what happens while you're gone. That is, if you even accept to read it. Mr Kaji told me that you and him talked before you came back, but he didn't want to tell me what it was about. He only said that you were not mad at me, and that you regretted yelling at me the last time we saw each other.  
我想这本笔记本将作为我向你讲述你离开期间发生的事情的一种方式。也就是说，如果你愿意读的话。加持先生告诉我，你回来之前和他谈过，但他不想告诉我内容。他只说你没有生我的气，而且你后悔上次见面时对我大喊大叫。  
  
  
  
You know, I shouldn't have let you go. I should have ran after you. I learned what my fath... What the Commander did. I feel so ashamed of myself for what I did... Or didn't do. For not insisting on knowing what was bothering you. For not being there to comfort you when you needed me.  
你知道吗，我不该让你走的。我应该追上你。我了解了我的父亲……指挥官所做的事情。我为自己所做的……或未做的事情感到无比羞愧……没有坚持要知道困扰你的事情。没有在你需要我的时候陪在你身边安慰你。  
  
  
  
Do you remember the night we first kissed ? That night, I promised myself I wouldn't run away from you anymore. And despite my word, I did. By not following you, I did. I failed you. You will not like this, but I'm sorry. Sincerely.  
你还记得我们第一次接吻的那个夜晚吗？那晚，我对自己承诺不会再逃避你。尽管我这样说了，我还是食言了。没有跟随你，我确实食言了。我让你失望了。你可能不会喜欢这个，但我真的很抱歉。真心实意。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 4 : 第四天：  
  
  
  
If everyday is like this, I won't use a lot of pages of this notebook, that's for sure. Nothing happened. Misato is still at NERV. I think she's avoiding me. I don't understand why. I already know everything, right ? Do you think she's still hiding things from me ? This is killing me ! I'm starting to think that she doesn't come home because she does have bad news to tell me.  
如果每天都这样，我肯定用不了这笔记本的很多页。什么都没发生。美里还在 NERV。我觉得她在躲着我。我不明白为什么。我不是已经知道一切了吗？你觉得她还在对我隐瞒什么吗？这让我快疯了！我开始觉得她不回家是因为有坏消息要告诉我。  
  
  
  
Mr Kaji didn't come either, oddly enough. I spent the whole day alone, in my room. I didn't even bother myself with cooking. I'm not hungry, I'm sad. The only thing I feel is sadness, but the tears won't come.  
奇怪的是，加持先生也没来。我一整天都独自待在房间里。连做饭都懒得动。我不饿，我只是难过。唯一的感觉就是悲伤，但眼泪就是流不出来。  
  
  
  
Oh ! I fed Pen Pen. At least I did something today. He seems somber too. I guess he misses you as well.  
哦！我喂了 Pen Pen。至少今天我做了点事。他看起来也很忧郁。我想他也在想念你。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 5 : 第五天：  
  
  
  
Misato came back today. I don't know what I was expecting though, she just drank beer after beer as soon as she passed the threshold. She didn't even come see me before. It still cheered me a little to see her, even though we hardly talked.  
美里今天回来了。虽然我不知道自己在期待什么，但她一进门就开始一瓶接一瓶地喝啤酒。她甚至都没先来看我一眼。尽管我们几乎没怎么交谈，但看到她我还是感到一丝欣慰。  
  
  
  
I thought I would be pry some information out of her in her state but she kept silent. I'm really worried now. I'm really starting to doubt that I'll be able to give you this notebook one day.  
我本以为在她这种状态下能套出些信息，但她始终保持沉默。我现在真的很担心。我开始越来越怀疑自己是否有一天能将这本笔记交给你。  
  
  
  
But this isn't the worst part. Do you want to know it ? She cooked for the both of us. And I realized this only when I had finished eating ! I have to do something, I can't stay like this. I didn't even think what she "cooked" was that bad, can you believe this ?  
但这还不是最糟糕的部分。你想知道吗？她为我们俩做了饭。而我直到吃完才意识到这一点！我必须做些什么，我不能就这样下去。我甚至没觉得她做的“饭”有那么糟糕，你能相信吗？  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 6 : 第六天：  
  
  
  
Today was the first sync test since the Angel. We had to do them in the test plugs, since all the Evas are still being repaired. If another Angel attacks us, we won't last long. None of them can be used yet.  
今天是自使徒事件以来的首次同步测试。由于所有 EVA 仍在维修中，我们必须在测试插头中进行。如果另一个使徒攻击我们，我们撑不了多久。它们都还不能使用。  
  
  
  
I thought this test would help me think about something else. Guess what ? It didn't. And I did horribly. I don't care to be honest. I didn't even react when Misato told me that I was barely above the activation threshold. Even Toji did better than me.  
我以为这次测试能让我分心，不去想那些事。猜猜怎么着？并没有。而且我考得一塌糊涂。说实话，我不在乎。当美里告诉我，我的成绩勉强超过激活阈值时，我甚至没有任何反应。就连真嗣都比我考得好。  
  
  
  
He tried to talk to me but I left as soon and as quickly as possible. I had only one thing on my mind when I came to NERV today, I wanted to see Unit 02... To see you. It was very strange to see it with all those bandages instead of the armor on its face. And its eyes They looked so... Alive... So human. I don't really know how to describe them, they were really unsettling. I had the impression that your Eva was looking at me the whole time I stayed there.  
他试图和我说话，但我尽快迅速离开了。今天来到 NERV，我心里只有一个念头，我想看看二号机……想看看你。看到它脸上缠满绷带而不是装甲，感觉很奇怪。还有它的眼睛，它们看起来那么……有生命……那么像人。我真的不知道怎么形容，它们真的很令人不安。我在那里停留的时候，总觉得你的 Eva 一直在看着我。  
  
  
  
There were wires sticking out of it from everywhere. I don't know why they are here. Are they some sort of life support for you ? Are they used to monitor the Eva ? It doesn't matter. What matters to me was that you are there. I promise I'll come visit you as much as possible, but I thought about it, I can't come everyday and stay there all the time. It's already suspicious enough of me to come see Unit 02 in the first place. So I decided to come see you every time there'll be sync test or when I need to go to NERV.  
到处都是裸露的电线。我不知道它们为什么在这里。是为了给你提供生命支持吗？还是用来监控 Eva 的？这些都不重要。对我来说，重要的是你在那里。我保证会尽可能多地来看你，但我想过了，我不能每天都来，也不能一直待在这里。我来看二号机这件事本身就已经够可疑的了。所以我决定，每次同步测试或者需要去 NERV 的时候，我都会来看你。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 7 : 第七天：  
  
  
  
We talked with Misato in the evening. She told me she had realized that she hadn't been there for me and promised me that she would from now on. I guess my sync ratio was really that bad !  
晚上我们和美里聊了聊。她告诉我，她意识到自己一直没在我身边，并承诺从现在开始会陪着我。我想我的同步率真的那么糟糕！  
  
  
  
She promised me that she would not avoid me anymore, and that she shouldn't have done it in the first place. It still feels strange you know. I've spent most of my life alone, I'm not used to having someone tell me that sort of things. My teacher would have probably ignored me completely in this situation, and he wouldn't have apologized, or even realized how it would have made me feel.  
她向我承诺，她不会再避开我了，而且她一开始就不该这么做。你知道吗，这感觉还是很奇怪。我大半辈子都是一个人过的，不习惯有人对我说这种话。我的老师在这种情况下可能会完全忽视我，他不会道歉，甚至不会意识到这会让我感到怎样。  
  
  
  
We also talked about relationships. Like the one we used to have. It was really awkward. That's what made me realize that she was "back". She was really enjoying herself while teasing me. Overall, it was almost a normal evening. It was nice.  
我们还谈到了关系，就像我们曾经拥有的那种。真的很尴尬。这让我意识到她“回来了”。她一边逗我一边乐在其中。总的来说，那几乎是一个正常的夜晚。感觉很好。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 8 : 第 8 天：  
  
  
  
Ayanami came to the apartment today. I was really surprised to see her. She wanted to talk to me, maybe she was worried since I didn't come back to school since the last Angel. She asked me how I felt and more importantly, why I felt this way. She didn't say it like that but what she meant was that she didn't quite understand the concept of sadness.  
今天绫波来到了公寓。看到她我真的很惊讶。她想和我谈谈，可能是因为自从上次使徒事件后我就没回学校，她担心了吧。她问我感觉如何，更重要的是，为什么会有这种感觉。她没有直接这么说，但她的意思是她不太理解悲伤的概念。  
  
  
  
We didn't talk for a long time, Ayanami just came, asked me some questions and left. We talked about the Commander and this time she didn't slap me for telling her what I thought about him.  
我们并没有聊太久，绫波只是过来问了几个问题就离开了。我们谈到了司令官，这次她没有因为我对他说了我的看法而打我。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 9 : 第 9 天：  
  
  
  
I went to see the Commander today. I was about to spend yet another day doing nothing except reminiscing about you and the time we spent together when my mind took another direction. I thought about the last time we talked... The last time I saw you, except this time it didn't make me wistful, it made me angry. Very angry. So I left the apartment and went straight to my... To the Commander's office.  
今天我去见了指挥官。我本打算又是一个无所事事的日子，除了回忆你和我们共度的时光外，我的思绪却转向了另一个方向。我想起了我们最后一次交谈...我最后一次见到你，但这次并没有让我感到惆怅，反而让我愤怒。非常愤怒。于是我离开了公寓，直奔我的...指挥官的办公室。  
  
  
  
And I completely lost control ! It seemed so unreal, as if it was someone else, as if I was watching it from outside my body. At one point I thought he might have me arrested or something but I just didn't care, I kept going and kept going until Section 2 agents took me out of the office and back to the apartment. I'm not proud of saying that but it felt good. I just slumped when I arrived home, drained of all my energy. It's been satisfying.  
我完全失控了！这一切似乎如此不真实，仿佛是别人在做，仿佛我是在从旁观者的角度看着。有那么一刻，我以为他可能会让人逮捕我，但我根本不在乎，我继续说下去，直到第二分队的特工把我带出办公室，送回了公寓。我并不以此为荣，但那种感觉很好。回到家时，我整个人都瘫软了，筋疲力尽。这种感觉很满足。  
  
  
  
I can't believe he could have been stupid enough to fire you. If we had been together... I mean all three of us, we might have been able to kill the Angel without... Your accident. I've never been this angry at anyone before. To think I used to fight to have him notice me... I'm pretty sure he has now.  
我简直不敢相信他竟然愚蠢到解雇你。如果我们三个人在一起...我是说我们三个，我们或许能够杀死天使而不会...发生你的意外。我从未对任何人如此愤怒过。想想我曾经为了让他注意到我而奋斗...我敢肯定他现在注意到了。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 10 : 第 10 天：  
  
  
  
Venting out all my anger must have had a really good effect on me, because this morning I decided I'd go back to school. I felt confident, I thought I could overcome any challenge !  
发泄完所有怒气肯定对我产生了很好的效果，因为今天早上我决定回学校。我感到自信满满，认为我能克服任何挑战！  
  
  
  
I was wrong. Very wrong. I realized this mistake as soon as I arrived. It wasn't that bad at first, I went straight to the classroom so I didn't see many people, it was pretty early.  
我错了。大错特错。我一到学校就意识到了这个错误。起初并不算太糟，我直接去了教室，没见到太多人，时间还挺早的。  
  
  
  
Then all I could do was look at your empty desk. I just stayed there, dumbly looking at your desk, everyone passing by me. I didn't even acknowledge them until one of them punched my shoulder rather hard. Toji. I hadn't faced him since I almost killed him. I didn't even think about him. I was paralyzed when I saw him. If it weren't for you, he'd probably be dead, and I didn't even check on him after the battle ! So I ran. I ran away from school and went straight back to the apartment.  
那时我能做的，只是望着你空荡荡的桌子。我就那样呆呆地站在那里，盯着你的桌子，任由周围的人来来往往。我甚至没有注意到他们，直到其中一个狠狠地捶了我的肩膀一拳。是冬二。自从我差点杀了他之后，我就没再面对过他。我甚至没想过他。看到他时，我整个人都僵住了。如果不是因为你，他可能已经死了，而我甚至在战斗结束后都没去查看他的情况！所以我逃了。我逃离了学校，径直回到了公寓。  
  
  
  
I thought I was safe. I was wrong, again. I underestimated Toji. He came after school. He just told me not to worry about him, that he was fine. He promised that if I continued feeling sorry about what happened he'd kick the crap out of me. He left right after that. I guess he knew I wouldn't have picked up the phone if he had called. At least he doesn't know about us.  
我以为我安全了。我又错了。我低估了冬二。他放学后来找我。他只是告诉我不用担心他，他很好。他承诺，如果我继续为发生的事情感到内疚，他会狠狠揍我一顿。说完他就走了。我想他知道如果他打电话，我是不会接的。至少他还不知道我们的事。  
  
  
  
Misato was very supportive, she reassured me when she came home, told me that I could take as much time off school as I needed. She also told me that Dr Akagi was making good progress. I have to trust her, no one knows the Evas like she does. Maya's helping a lot too.  
美里非常支持我，她回家时安慰我，告诉我可以请多久的假都行。她还告诉我，赤城博士正在取得很好的进展。我必须信任她，没有人比她更了解 EVA 了。玛雅也在帮很多忙。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 11 : 第 11 天：  
  
  
  
Toji and Kensuke came to see me today. It makes sense, after what happened yesterday. And I imagine Toji wanted to make sure I was doing as he had told. I'm still standing, so I guess I passed the test. Anyway, nothing really interesting happened, we just talked and payed some video games. It felt nice I have to admit. My only regret is that I can't talk to them. Not because we agreed on not telling anyone. Just because I don't feel like I want to tell them. I don't know if you see what I mean, I'm not sure I understand myself.  
今天，真治和健介来看我了。这很合理，毕竟昨天发生了那样的事。我想真治是想确认我是否按照他说的在做。我还站着，所以我想我通过了测试。无论如何，并没有什么特别有趣的事情发生，我们只是聊了聊天，玩了些电子游戏。不得不说，感觉很好。我唯一的遗憾是我不能和他们交谈。不是因为我们约定了不告诉任何人。只是因为我不想告诉他们。我不知道你是否明白我的意思，我甚至不太理解自己。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 12 : 第 12 天：  
  
  
  
It was Mr Kaji's turn to be here today. He wanted to know how I was feeling. We talked for a long time. About you, about Misato... He stayed a while so I won't bore you with the uninteresting parts, but something peculiar happened. When I told him in details how I felt, he seemed pensive. He wasn't smiling like he usually does. I really can't hazard a guess as to what I could have said that could have had this effect on him.  
今天轮到加治先生来这里了。他想知道我的感觉如何。我们聊了很久。关于你，关于美里...他待了一会儿，所以我不把那些无聊的部分讲给你听了，但发生了一件奇怪的事。当我详细告诉他我的感受时，他显得若有所思。他没有像平时那样微笑。我真的猜不到我说了什么会让他有这样的反应。  
  
  
  
I just told him how sad I was that you weren't there anymore... Even just putting this on paper seems strange. I'm not used to sharing my feelings like that. It's even more strange that I'm writing them here, so that means that I'm writing them for you to read...  
我只是告诉他我因为你不在而感到多么悲伤...即使只是把这些写下来也感觉很奇怪。我不习惯这样分享我的感受。更奇怪的是我在这里写下来，这意味着我是写给你看的...  
  
  
  
Anyway. I told him that I didn't know how I would feel if I didn't see you again. That I already felt devastated... That I thought you deserved a proper burial, even if you wouldn't be there... Just like my mother.  
总之。我告诉他我不知道如果再也见不到你会是什么感觉。我已经感到心碎...我想你应该得到一个正式的葬礼，即使你不在那里...就像我母亲一样。  
  
  
  
He almost seemed shocked when I told him that. I say almost because I just can't be sure with him, he never shows his emotions. But I can assure you I saw something.  
当我告诉他那件事时，他几乎显得震惊。我说'几乎'是因为我无法完全确定他的反应，他从不表露情感。但我可以向你保证，我确实看到了些什么。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 13 : 第 13 天：  
  
  
  
I have not been in your room since the last time we saw each other. I promise. But after what happened, I needed to. It's part of you, your little world, with your clothes and magazines on the floor. Your still unmade bed ! And it still smells like you a little. I didn't want to intrude, I swear, I didn't feel like you would have wanted me to anymore. But today I had to. I try to cope with your disappearance, but it's just too much. I'm scared. Scared that I'll never see you again. I miss you.  
自上次见面后，我就没再进过你的房间。我发誓。但发生了那些事后，我不得不来。这是你的一部分，你的小世界，地上散落着你的衣服和杂志。你的床还没整理！而且这里还残留着你的气息。我不想打扰，我发誓，我觉得你不会再希望我来了。但今天我必须来。我试图应对你的消失，但这太难承受了。我害怕。害怕再也见不到你。我想你。  
  
  
  
I should explain why. Today, we had a sync test. We were four. The new Pilot's name is Kaworu Nagisa. He's the Fifth Child. He was sent here as dedicated Pilot for Unit 02. They replaced you ! And the only reason I can think of for them doing this is that you're not coming back.  
我应该解释一下原因。今天，我们进行了同步测试。一共四个人。新驾驶员的名字是渚薰。他是第五适格者。他被派来专门驾驶二号机。他们替换了你！我能想到的唯一理由是他们认为你不会回来了。  
  
  
  
He tried to talk to me after the test, I kind of lost control and lashed out at him. I even tried to punch him ! Toji was there, he caught me before I could do anything. I feel kind of bad because he seems nice enough. But he's replacing you... I'm thankful that Toji stopped me, even though I still feel bad when I see him.  
测试结束后他试图和我说话，我有点失控，对他发了脾气。我甚至想揍他！真嗣在那里，他及时拦住了我。我感到有些内疚，因为他看起来挺好的。但他取代了你...我很感激真嗣阻止了我，尽管每次见到他我还是会感到难过。  
  
  
  
You would have been proud I think. I lost control just because of what he is in relation to you. I'm less patient than I thought. It makes sense... You're the only one who tried my patience to this extent before that. And I know I would never have lost control against you.  
我想你会为我感到骄傲的。仅仅因为他与你有关我就失控了。我比自己想象的更没耐心。这很合理...你是唯一一个让我如此不耐烦的人。而且我知道我绝不会对你失控。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 14 : 第 14 天：  
  
  
  
We talked about you with Misato. We spent the day together, she managed to take a day off just to take care of me. She told me about the time she was your guardian in Germany, it seemed nice. At least she seemed to have enjoyed it. She told me she even missed the times when you both fought ! Because it always passed. She said she was sad that as time went by you seemed to grow colder and more distant towards everyone... Except me, she added that she was really happy to see how we had a positive influence on each other. She wasn't teasing this time, which made me all the more uncomfortable !  
我和美里谈到了你。我们共度了一天，她特意请了一天假来照顾我。她告诉我她在德国时作为你的监护人的时光，听起来很不错。至少她似乎很享受那段日子。她还说她甚至怀念你们俩争吵的时光！因为那些争吵总会过去。她说随着时间的推移，你似乎对每个人都变得冷漠和疏远...除了我，她补充说，看到我们彼此产生了积极的影响，她真的很高兴。这次她没有开玩笑，这让我更加不自在！  
  
  
  
When I asked her why you were distant, she refused to tell me. She said that if you wanted me to know, you would be the one to tell me when you'd come back. I really, genuinely wish I knew. I already told you, I hate to know how sad you are and not being able to do anything about it.  
当我问她你为何变得疏远时，她拒绝告诉我。她说如果你希望我知道，你会回来时亲自告诉我。我真的，真切地希望我能知道。我已经告诉过你，我知道你有多难过却无能为力，这让我很讨厌。  
  
  
  
Misato's trying to stay positive and I can't thank her enough for that, but you know her, she's really not good with this kind of things. I know she's preoccupied. I want to believe her when she says you'll come back, but it's really hard.  
美里一直在努力保持积极态度，我对此感激不尽，但你也了解她，她真的不擅长处理这类事情。我知道她心事重重。我想要相信她说的你会回来，但真的很难。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 15 : 第 15 天：  
  
  
  
Toji came to see me after school. He knows about us. My reaction when he asked if this was true was... Eloquent, to say the least. He told me that Ayanami had shared her suspicions with him one day. So much for keeping it secret.  
放学后，真嗣来看我了。他知道了我们的事。他问我这是否属实时，我的反应……至少可以说是言简意赅。他告诉我，绫波有一天向他表示了她的怀疑。保密工作算是彻底失败了。  
  
  
  
He doesn't really approve, but he doesn't know you like I do. That being said, he respects you a lot. He told me about your comeback to NERV, he was really impressed at how you talked to the Commander ! Don't repeat it but he told me that the Commander scares him. I can relate.  
他其实并不完全赞同，但他不像我这样了解你。尽管如此，他非常尊重你。他跟我提到你重返 NERV 时与指挥官的对话，对你的表现印象深刻！别告诉别人，他跟我说指挥官让他感到害怕。我能理解那种感觉。  
  
  
  
Before he left, he told me he was happy for us. Well, he said for me, but it's a start, right ?  
他离开前告诉我，他为我们感到高兴。嗯，他说是为我高兴，但这是个好的开始，对吧？  
  
  
  
At first I was... Apprehensive. I didn't want to talk to him. He has already moved on, but I didn't. I don't think he realizes what could have happened. That being said, I'm glad we talked. It took my mind of everything, even if it was only temporary.  
起初我有些……顾虑。我不想和他交谈。他已经向前看了，而我还没有。我不认为他意识到可能发生的事情。尽管如此，我很高兴我们谈了。这让我的思绪暂时从一切烦恼中解脱出来。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 16 : 第 16 天：  
  
  
  
Everything reminds me of you. Take this room for example. If I'm in there, it's because of you, because you stole my bedroom when you moved in. Now that I think about it, I really don't understand what came to Misato's mind when she took you in as well. Did she plan for me to get kicked out of my room ? She must have. You would never have agreed to live in the smallest room of the apartment. She must have known that ! Maybe she wanted me to protest.  
一切都会让我想起你。以这个房间为例。如果我在这里，那是因为你，因为你搬进来时抢走了我的卧室。现在想来，我真的不明白美里当时是怎么想的，她怎么会也把你接进来。她是不是计划让我被赶出自己的房间？她肯定知道。你绝不会同意住在公寓里最小的房间。她一定早就料到了！也许她想让我抗议。  
  
  
  
Do you want to know why I didn't ? There are two reasons. First, I knew it wouldn't have changed anything. I know, this is not a good reason, I know I should stand my ground. I didn't because of the second reason, which is that wanted you to stay. If I had insisted enough on not wanting to live in the closet, Misato would have made one of us leave, and I didn't want that. I wanted to get to know you. I didn't like my new room, obviously, but that was a small price to pay for what I could gain for it.  
你想知道为什么我没有抗议吗？有两个原因。首先，我知道那不会改变什么。我知道，这不是一个好理由，我知道我应该坚持自己的立场。我没有抗议是因为第二个原因，那就是我希望你留下。如果我坚持不想住在壁橱里，美里会让其中一个人离开，而我不想那样。我想了解你。我当然不喜欢我的新房间，但为了我能从中得到的东西，这是一个很小的代价。  
  
  
  
I thought about all this when I was making breakfast this morning. You usually used to be there, sitting at the table behind me, yelling at me for not cooking fast enough, complaining because you were angry at one thing or another. It's funny how our perception of things can change. Now I would give anything just to have you yell at me again.  
今早做早餐时，我想起了这一切。你通常会坐在我身后的桌旁，对我做饭不够快大喊大叫，因为这样那样的原因生气而抱怨。有趣的是，我们对事物的看法是如何改变的。现在我愿意付出一切，只为了你能再次对我大喊大叫。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 17 : 第 17 天：  
  
  
  
I wonder... What would you have done I had been the one absorbed ? If I had to guess, I think you would have been mad at me for disappearing like that. You would probably have just waited for me to return to yell at me and call me an idiot !  
我在想……如果是我被吸收了，你会怎么做？如果让我猜，我想你会因为我那样消失而生气。你可能会一直等我回来，然后对我大喊大叫，骂我是个傻瓜！  
  
  
  
Maybe you would have been sad ? Even just a little ? In any case, I'm sure you would have taken this much better than I do. You've always been so strong.  
也许你会感到悲伤？哪怕只是一点点？无论如何，我确信你会比我处理得更好。你一直都很坚强。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 18 : 第 18 天：  
  
  
  
I watched the movie we saw together again. I want to believe that they kept their promise. That they both came back and were reunited. I understand it's just wishful thinking, and that I'm just projecting my own hopes, but I can't tell you how much I need to believe they were reunited in the end...  
我又重看了我们一起看过的那部电影。我想要相信他们遵守了承诺，最终都回来了并重逢了。我知道这只是我的美好愿望，是我将自己的希望投射其中，但我无法告诉你，我有多么需要相信他们最终重逢了...  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 19 : 第 19 天：  
  
  
  
Well ! That was an interesting day ! Toji took me to visit his sister at the hospital. She reminded me a lot of you ! She might be stuck in the hospital but she doesn't let it get to her ! She's so energetic and lively. You wouldn't recognize Toji when he's around her, he's so quiet around her. That's probably because Sakura is always scolding him !  
哎呀！今天真是特别的一天！Toji 带我去医院看望了他的妹妹。她让我想起了你！虽然她被困在医院里，但她从不让这影响到自己！她充满活力，生机勃勃。你在她身边绝对认不出 Toji，他在她面前特别安静。这大概是因为 Sakura 总是训斥他吧！  
  
  
  
Toji told me she's getting better every day, so she'll be released soon. He hasn't told her yet because he doesn't want to keep her hopes up. I can understand that, she already can't stand in one place ! That's to be expected, she's bored out of her mind in there. She's been in the hospital for five months and she told me her most exciting day has been when she got transferred to NERV hospital. He told me that he accepted to become a Pilot because of that. He asked me why I was still piloting, since he knows how much I hate it, so I told him that he and I fought for the same reason. That I fight for you, that I won't run away from a fight because you count on me to have your back, even if I know you don't need me to !  
Toji 告诉我她每天都在好转，很快就能出院了。他还没告诉她，因为他不想让她抱有太高的希望。我能理解，她已经无法在一个地方站稳了！这很正常，她在那里无聊透顶。她已经在医院住了五个月，她告诉我她最激动的一天是被转到 NERV 医院的时候。他告诉我，他之所以接受成为驾驶员，就是因为这个。他问我为什么还在驾驶，因为他知道我有多讨厌这件事，所以我告诉他，我和他为了同一个理由而战。我为你而战，我不会逃避战斗，因为你指望我支持你，即使我知道你并不需要我！  
  
  
  
I wasn't sure I would be telling you this, but I also felt very queasy around her. She kept telling me I saved her life, that I was a hero. I've never considered myself a hero. I hate being called that. She's in the hospital because of me ! And she calls me a hero. I don't understand. I still think Toji did the right thing when he punched me... She did get hurt because of me. And I wasn't even able to protect you. If I had fought better, she wouldn't have been injured and you probably would still be there.  
我不确定是否该告诉你这些，但我确实在她身边感到非常不适。她一直对我说是我救了她的命，称我为英雄。我从未认为自己是个英雄。我讨厌被那样称呼。她因我而住院！而她却称我为英雄。我不明白。我仍然认为当真嗣打我时，他做的是对的……她的确因我而受伤。而我甚至没能保护好你。如果我当时战斗得更出色，她就不会受伤，你可能还会在那里。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 20 : 第 20 天：  
  
  
  
I went to see you after the test today, as usual. I'd like to come more, but I don't want to attract too much attention. The techs didn't seem to care, they must be used to seeing me by now. Some of them looked at me solemnly, I don't know if it's because they pity me or if they sympathize with my sorrow. To be honest, I don't really care, as long as they leave me alone.  
今天测试后，我像往常一样去看你。我想多来几次，但又不想引起太多注意。技术人员们似乎并不在意，他们肯定已经习惯看到我了。有些人严肃地看着我，我不知道是因为他们可怜我还是同情我的悲伤。说实话，我并不太在意，只要他们别来打扰我就好。  
  
  
  
Misato doesn't like that. She understands why I do it so she lets me, yet she'd rather I did not go see you. She's right, it's dangerous, but that doesn't change anything. Seeing your Eva is the only form of contact I still have with you, and I really need it, I'm starting to have trouble remembering your face or your voice.  
美里不喜欢这样。她明白我为什么这么做，所以她让我去，但她更希望我不去看你。她是对的，这很危险，但这并没有改变什么。看到你的 Eva 是我与你唯一的联系方式，我真的需要它，我开始难以记住你的脸或你的声音。  
  
  
  
The good news is that all our Evas are repaired and ready for combat. When I asked, Dr Akagi promised me they would use yours only if they don't have any other choice. The Fifth Child is only a backup in case Ayanami, Toji and I fail, and it won't happen. I won't let it. My sync rate is not as high as it used to be but it's climbing up slowly, and Toji promised me he'd help. He seemed really honest, you must have left quite an impression on him !  
好消息是，我们所有的 Eva 都已修复并准备好投入战斗。我问过时田博士，她答应我，除非别无选择，否则不会使用你的 Eva。第五个孩子只是备份，以防绫波、我和剑失败，但这不会发生的。我不会让它发生。我的同步率虽然没有以前那么高，但正在慢慢上升，剑答应我会帮忙。他看起来非常真诚，你一定给他留下了深刻的印象！  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 21 : 第 21 天：  
  
  
  
Kensuke came today. I feel like everyone takes turn just not to leave me alone. I'm a little angry about that, but on the other hand, it's nice so overall I'm glad they do.  
今天健介来了。我感觉大家轮流来，就是不想让我一个人待着。我对此有点生气，但另一方面，这很贴心，总的来说我很高兴他们这么做。  
  
  
  
He has no clue as to what's been going on between you and me,, I'm pretty sure of that, because he kept telling me that not having you to boss me around had to be amazing. According to him, I'm on vacation from you and your moods right now.  
他完全不知道我们之间发生了什么，我对此相当确定，因为他一直告诉我，没有你来指挥我一定很棒。据他说，我现在是从你和你的情绪中放假了。  
  
  
  
You know what I think about that, so you can guess how it made me feel to hear this. Don't get me wrong, I still really appreciate what he's doing for me, what they all are, but I can't believe he hasn't put two and two together yet. Then again you had to tell me about Toji and Hikari.  
你知道我对这事的看法，所以你能猜到听到这些我是什么感觉。别误会，我仍然非常感激他为我做的一切，他们所有人都是，但我无法相信他还没把事情联系起来。不过话说回来，你得告诉我关于藤井和光的事。  
  
  
  
He invited me to go to the arcade tomorrow with the three of them, I wanted to say no, but I might have a good time so I accepted.  
他邀请我明天和他们三个一起去游戏厅，我本想拒绝，但或许会玩得很开心，所以我接受了。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 22 : 第 22 天：  
  
  
  
Mission accomplished. I had a lot of fun. So much that I didn't think about you for a few hours. And it made me feel guilty. It's not that I feel that I'm not allowed to have fun now that you're... Not there, it's just that it doesn't feel right. You should still be with us, having fun with us, living your life !  
任务完成了。我玩得很开心。开心到有几小时没想起你。这让我感到内疚。并不是我觉得你不在了我就不能享受乐趣，只是那样做感觉不对。你应该还和我们在一起，和我们一起玩乐，过你的生活！  
  
  
  
Sometimes it feels like everyone just kept going, not realizing just how much they have lost too. They don't realize that they might be dead tomorrow because you won't be there to protect them !  
有时候，感觉就像每个人都继续前行，没有意识到他们也失去了多少。他们没有意识到，可能明天他们就会死去，因为你不再在那里保护他们！  
  
  
  
Not thinking about you feels like I'm betraying you in a way, like I'm starting to do just as they do, forgetting you. It's not right. I should think about you all the time. You disappeared ! You might never come back ! They should erect a statue in your memory ! Declare a national holiday ! And I should not stop thinking about you like I did. I'm pathetic.  
不去想你，感觉就像在某种程度上背叛了你，就像我开始像他们一样，逐渐忘记你。这不对。我应该时刻想着你。你消失了！你可能永远不会回来了！他们应该为你立一座雕像！宣布一个全国假日！而我也不应该像之前那样停止想你。我真是可悲。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 23 : 第 23 天：  
  
  
  
Sometimes I wish that I didn't come to your room when I did. If I had ran away like I always used to, it would have been easier for me to cope with your disappearance. Losing you hurts more than any physical pain. I feel so empty. And guilty for even thinking this. I don't want you to believe that I regret what happened between us. I really don't, I promise, it's just that it's almost unbearable sometimes.  
有时我真希望自己没有在你房间出现。如果我能像以往那样逃走，面对你的消失或许会容易些。失去你比任何肉体上的痛苦都更让我心痛。我感到如此空虚，甚至为此感到内疚。我不想让你认为我后悔了我们之间发生的事。我真的不后悔，我发誓，只是有时候这几乎让我无法承受。  
  
  
  
Sometimes it just feels like it's too much to handle, and there's absolutely nothing I can do. It's horrible to be this powerless. The only thing I can do is accept it and move on. I don't want to. And I won't.  
有时感觉这一切太过沉重，我完全无能为力。这种无力感太可怕了。我唯一能做的就是接受并继续前行。我不想这样做，也不会这样做。  
  
  
  
Misato does everything she can to reassure me. She always tells me that Dr Akagi is making progress and that you'll be back with us soon. She doesn't know anything. Even Dr Akagi doesn't know anything. There's no way of knowing for sure that you'll come back ! If things had stayed as they were, I would have lost a friend. It would have been hard of course, but it would have been nothing compared to this.  
美里尽她所能安慰我。她总是告诉我赤木博士正在取得进展，你很快就会回到我们身边。她其实一无所知。就连赤木博士也不知情。没有人能确切知道你是否会回来！如果一切保持原样，我只会失去一个朋友。当然那会很艰难，但与现在相比根本不算什么。  
  
  
  
I lost you. The one I care for the most. The one I was the most scared of losing. And I don't want to talk about it to anyone, because no one would understand. You're the only one who could understand. The only one I want to talk to about it.  
我失去了你。那个我最在乎的人。那个我最害怕失去的人。我不想和任何人谈论这件事，因为没有人会理解。只有你能理解。只有你是我想要倾诉的人。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 24 : 第 24 天：  
  
  
  
Do you want to come back in the first place ? I thought about it last night. I know the question is strange, but I mean, maybe you're happy. If you're conscious of what's happening maybe forcing you to come back would only be cruel.  
你原本就想回来吗？我昨晚想了这个问题。我知道这个问题很奇怪，但我的意思是，也许你很快乐。如果你知道发生了什么，也许强迫你回来只会是残忍的。  
  
  
  
I'm not sure I would. I've tried all my life to run away from the pain, and not being aware of what's happening sounds almost... Appealing.  
我不确定我会这么做。我一生都在试图逃离痛苦，对正在发生的事情一无所知听起来几乎……很吸引人。  
  
  
  
If I had been given this choice a few weeks ago, I would have probably chosen to stay there, away from the pain, from the loneliness, from the sadness. But now everything is different. You changed everything ! You made me realize that I'm not just an Eva Pilot. That's what I thought before, that people considered me only because of that. You made me realize that people were nice to me, and not just because I'm a Pilot.  
如果几周前给我这个选择，我可能会选择留在那里，远离痛苦、孤独和悲伤。但现在一切都不同了。你改变了这一切！你让我意识到我不仅仅是一个 EVA 驾驶员。以前我以为人们只因为我是驾驶员才看重我。你让我明白，人们对我的好，并不仅仅因为我是驾驶员。  
  
  
  
I wanted to talk to you before the battle, to face you, just to tell you that I was there for you. I am conscious of the fact that you would have had an easier time believing me if I had followed you last time. I need you to be patient with me too.  
我想在战斗前和你谈谈，面对你，只想告诉你我支持你。我知道如果上次我跟随你，你会更容易相信我。我也需要你对我有耐心。  
  
  
  
Now, with everything that's happened, if I had been absorbed and you had been the one left behind, I would have come back just so I could tell you what I want to tell you.  
如今，经历了这一切，如果被吞噬的是我，而你被留了下来，我也会回来，只为告诉你我想说的话。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 25 : 第 25 天：  
  
  
  
Rei and I talked again. It seems they are making good progress towards your rescue. It made me really happy to hear that. Even though it might be stupid, I still hold onto the hope that you'll come back. That I'll be able to see you, even if you don't want to talk to me anymore, I don't care.  
丽和我又谈了一次。看来他们正朝着救你的方向取得良好进展。听到这个消息我真的很高兴。尽管这可能很愚蠢，但我仍然抱着你会回来的希望。哪怕你不再想和我说话，我也无所谓，只要能再见到你。  
  
  
  
The weird part came after. She told me that she understood better how I felt now, she has thought about it a lot after our conversation. She told me that she hoped someone would mourn her as I am mourning your right now if she were to disappear too. And she added that she hated feeling that way because she was hoping to make someone sad because of her, and someone close to her. I told her I would mourn her too. I don't want to. I don't want anyone to die.  
奇怪的是在那之后。她告诉我，她现在更理解我的感受了，自从我们谈话后她一直在思考。她说，如果她也不见了，她希望有人能像我现在为你哀悼一样为她哀悼。她还补充说，她讨厌那种感觉，因为她希望因为她的离去，某个亲近的人会感到悲伤。我告诉她，我也会为她哀悼。我不希望这样。我不希望任何人死去。  
  
  
  
She said something that cheered me up though. She said that things were different now without you. Quieter. That made me laugh ! She told me that now, she finds the locker room unnerving because it's too silent. I guess she misses you too. Despite everything that's happened between you.  
不过，她说了些让我开心的话。她说，现在你不在了，一切都变得不同了。更安静了。这让我笑了！她告诉我，现在她觉得更衣室令人不安，因为太安静了。我想她也很想念你。尽管你们之间发生了那么多事。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 26 : 第 26 天：  
  
  
  
Today has to have been the most surprising day since you left. Toji came to visit me. With Hikari. And according to them, I'm the one responsible for them being together now. I made him understand that running away was not a solution. It might seem strange but I am jealous of them. They are together, happy. I envy them so much ! How come they are allowed to be happy together when we can't ? This is so frustrating ! Either they don't realize what happened or they don't care ! It's not fair that they get to keep on with their lives when you can't ! I know this is selfish but I want you back ! I need you back !  
今天肯定是你离开后最令人惊讶的一天。真治来看我了，带着光。而且据他们说，我现在成了他们在一起的功臣。我让他明白了逃避不是解决办法。这听起来可能很奇怪，但我确实嫉妒他们。他们在一起，很幸福。我太羡慕他们了！为什么他们能幸福地在一起，而我们却不能？这太让人沮丧了！要么他们没意识到发生了什么，要么他们不在乎！你不能继续生活，而他们却可以，这太不公平了！我知道这很自私，但我想要你回来！我需要你回来！  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 27 : 第 27 天：  
  
  
  
Okay. This week is getting stranger and stranger. As usual I came to see you after the sync test, I'm doing better by the way, I'm almost at my former sync rate, only three points down ! The new Pilot apologized to me when he saw me in the changing room. He told me he understood that I was upset because of him, and that it had never been his intention. He also said something about human hearts being as fragile as glass or something, I can't recall. I shouldn't be mad at him, he has done nothing wrong if we think about it.  
好吧。这周变得越来越奇怪了。像往常一样，同步测试后我来看你，顺便说一句，我做得更好了，我的同步率几乎恢复到了以前的水平，只差三分！新驾驶员在更衣室见到我时向我道歉。他告诉我，他理解我因为他而感到不快，那从来不是他的本意。他还说了些关于人心如玻璃般脆弱之类的话，我记不清了。仔细想想，我不该生他的气，他并没有做错什么。  
  
  
  
It wasn't the strangest thing that happened though. As I said, I was standing in front of Unit 02 as usual, not paying attention to anything but the four eyes before me when someone stopped right next to me. It was Vice Commander Fuyutsuki. He told me that he appreciated my dedication. I was about to tell him that I wasn't doing it to get his approbation or anyone else's when he said something so cryptic that I still think about it as I'm writing these lines. He told me to always remain hopeful... No. He told me not to lose hope. Why would he do that ? Does it mean something ? Do you think I'm over-analyzing things ? He's the closest person to the Commander, maybe he knows things that even Misato doesn't. It's probably nothing, he probably just wanted to comfort me, but it's so strange that I can't help but think about it.  
但这并不是最奇怪的事情。如我所说，我像往常一样站在 02 号机前，只专注于眼前的四只眼睛，这时有人停在了我旁边。是副司令福音津木。他告诉我他很欣赏我的奉献精神。我正要告诉他，我这么做并不是为了得到他的认可或任何人的赞赏，他却说了一句如此神秘的话，以至于我在写这些文字时仍在思考。他告诉我永远要保持希望...不，他告诉我不要失去希望。他为什么要这么做？这是否意味着什么？你觉得我是不是过度解读了？他是离司令最近的人，也许他知道连美里都不知道的事情。可能这没什么，他可能只是想安慰我，但这件事太奇怪了，我忍不住去想。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 28 :  第 28 天：  
  
  
  
I finally went back to school. And I managed to get through the day. As you can imagine, the lesson was as boring as it has always been. At least I know I haven't missed much. And Hikari has given me the printouts I didn't have when she came.  
我终于回到了学校。并且设法度过了这一天。如你所想，课程一如既往地枯燥。至少我知道我没错过什么。而且光在我不在的时候给了我打印件。  
  
  
  
It could have been a rather normal day, if people had minded their own business. Everyone kept staring at me. I didn't notice that last time, then again, I didn't notice much that day. Some of them just came to me to ask personal questions and things I didn't want to answer.  
本可以是相当平常的一天，如果人们都管好自己的事。每个人都盯着我看。上次我并没有注意到这一点，再说，那天我也没注意到太多事情。他们中的一些人甚至直接来问我一些私人问题，那些我不想回答的事情。  
  
  
  
Some girls even came and tried to comfort me. I don't understand why now they're talking to me. Why couldn't they do what they always did and ignored me ? They seemed weird, I don't really know how to explain, but them being nice seemed out of place. As I said they used to ignore me, why are they trying to talk to me now ?  
甚至有些女孩过来试图安慰我。我不明白为什么现在她们开始和我说话了。为什么她们不能像往常一样无视我呢？她们的行为显得很奇怪，我真不知道该怎么解释，但她们突然变得友好似乎有些不合时宜。就像我说的，她们以前总是无视我，为什么现在却试图和我交谈呢？  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 29 : 第 29 天：  
  
  
  
You remember when I told you I went to see the Commander ? Well, I thought about it and I came to the conclusion that he's not the one I should be mad at for what happened.  
你还记得我告诉过你我去见了指挥官吗？嗯，我想了想，得出的结论是，对于发生的事情，我真正该生气的不是他。  
  
  
  
It should be me.  
应该是我。  
  
  
  
He has his part of responsibility, of course, but so do I. And if I had been there for you, we could have talked to him together, maybe even with Misato. Maybe we could have convinced him that getting rid of you was a mistake.  
他当然有他的责任，但我也有。如果我当时在你身边，我们本可以一起去找他，甚至可能和美里一起。也许我们能说服他，除掉你是个错误。  
  
  
  
Instead of that, I stayed away from you. I didn't try to find you because I was scared of facing you. I'm a pathetic, weak little boy.  
我没有靠近你，反而远离了你。我没有试图寻找你，因为我害怕面对你。我是个可悲、软弱的小男孩。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 30 : 第 30 天：  
  
  
  
My teacher never taught me about religion, he wasn't very keen on these sorts of things. So I have never believed in any Gods or higher powers. To be perfectly honest, I hadn't even given it much thought. But now, I can understand why someone would.  
我的老师从未教过我关于宗教的知识，他对这类事情并不热衷。所以我从未相信过任何神或更高力量。老实说，我甚至没怎么思考过这个问题。但现在，我理解了为什么有人会相信。  
  
  
  
It seems comforting to just be able to believe that everything happens for a reason, that it is all part of a plan... That your disappearance has a meaning.  
似乎只要能相信一切皆有其道理，一切都是计划的一部分...你的消失也有其意义，这样想令人感到安慰。  
  
  
  
  
  
Day 31 :  第 31 天：  
  
  
  
Tomorrow.  明天。  
  
  
  
Tomorrow they will do whatever they have planned in order to save you. I would have preferred for it to be today. It would have been fitting to have you come back on your birthday.  
明天他们会按照计划行动，一切都是为了救你。我本希望是今天，若能在你生日这天让你归来，那该多好。  
  
  
  
Misato told me not to come, she told me that I wouldn't be able to keep my emotions to myself and that it would be too dangerous. She's still looking out for us, I'm glad. However, I can't help but notice that there are two meanings in what she said. Of course, I wouldn't be able to hold myself if I saw you tomorrow. I miss you so much. But on the other hand, I know she said that because she doesn't want me around in case the operation fails. Please. I'm begging you if you can somehow hear me or something. Please come back.  
美里告诉我不要来，她说我无法控制自己的情绪，那样太危险了。她依然在关心我们，我很欣慰。然而，她的话中似乎还有另一层含义。当然，如果明天见到你，我肯定无法自持。我太想你了。但另一方面，我知道她这么说是因为不希望我在行动失败时在场。求你了，如果有什么方式你能听到我的话，请回来吧。  
  
  
  
This will be the last entry in this journal. Hopefully I'll be able to give it to you tomorrow. Even if I can't, I don't care, as long as you are safe. And if you don't come back, I'll stop writing anyway. Because that will mean that you'll never be able to read it.  
这将是这本日记的最后一篇。希望明天能亲手交给你。即便不能，我也无所谓，只要你平安无事。如果你回不来，我也不会再写下去，因为这意味着你永远无法读到它了。  
  
  
  
There is just one last thing that I wish to tell you however. Something I wish I had told you before, because I'm not sure I'll ever be able to now. I love you, Asuka. And I always will.  
然而，还有最后一件事我想告诉你。一件我希望能早点告诉你，因为我不确定现在是否还能说出口的事。我爱你，明日香。而且我会一直爱下去。  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
.  
  
  
  
"You... Idiot ! Come here right now !" A shrill voice pierced the eardrums of every person in the Katsuragi residence, waking most of them in the process, as well as some neighbors, probably. Shinji opened the door to Asuka's room just seconds after hearing this and entered her bedroom sheepishly. He was the only one in the apartment except from her not sleeping. Pen Pen was comfortably dozing in his fridge and Misato had brought Kaji with her to her own room some hours earlier.  
“你……笨蛋！马上过来！”一阵尖锐的声音穿透了葛城家的每一个人的耳膜，惊醒了大部分人，可能还有些邻居。听到这话几秒钟后，真嗣怯生生地打开了明日香的房门，走进她的卧室。除了她，公寓里只有他一个人没睡。Pen Pen 正舒适地在冰箱里打盹，美里几个小时前带着加持去了她自己的房间。  
  
  
  
When he entered the room, he saw Asuka sitting on her bed, facing the door, the notebook still open in front of her. Her eyes were red, and tears were rolling down her cheeks. Shinji turned his face away, not daring to look her in the eyes. "Look at me !" Asuka spoke angrily between sobs. He turned his head and stared into her eyes. He had never seen her so vulnerable before. While studying her, he almost couldn't recognize her, it was as if all her defenses had been destroyed. "I'm crying because of you ! Again !.. I never cry ! I promised myself I wouldn't cry anymore."  
当他走进房间时，看到明日香坐在床上，面对着门，笔记本还摊开在面前。她的眼睛红肿，泪水顺着脸颊滑落。真嗣转过头去，不敢直视她的眼睛。“看着我！”明日香在抽泣中愤怒地说道。他转过头，凝视着她的眼睛。他从未见过她如此脆弱。在观察她时，他几乎认不出她了，仿佛她所有的防线都已被摧毁。“我哭是因为你！又一次！……我从不哭！我发誓我不会再哭了。”  
  
  
  
"I'm sorry" Shinji was transfixed by the sight before his eyes, so he couldn't think of anything better to answer her.  
“对不起”真嗣被眼前的景象所震撼，以至于他想不出更好的回答。  
  
  
  
"Don't you "I'm sorry" me ! You stupid idiot !" She sounded very angry, her whole body was tense. She closed her eyes and sighed loudly. "You know I can't read kanjis, right ?" She wiped her tears with the back of her hand. "But I understood the general idea..." She added before lunging at Shinji in order to wrap her arms around him. She buried her head in his neck, with tears still rolling down her cheeks and landing on his t-shirt. "... And I love you too, idiot !"  
“别跟我说‘对不起’！你这个笨蛋！”她听起来非常生气，全身紧绷。她闭上眼睛，大声叹了口气。“你知道我看不懂汉字，对吧？”她用手背擦去泪水。“但我大致明白了……”她补充道，然后扑向真嗣，用双臂环抱住他。她将头埋在他的脖颈间，泪水依旧滑落，滴在他的 T 恤上。“……我也爱你，笨蛋！”

### Chapter 12 : Falling down
Hey !  
  
It's been a while ! This chapter hasn't been that easy to write. And Christmas tends to be really busy where I work. But enough excuses, here's a new chapter !  
好久不见！这一章写起来可不容易。而且圣诞节期间工作总是特别忙。不过，借口就到此为止，新的一章来了！  
  
  
  
They just stood there, embracing one another, not daring to let go. Asuka was clinging tightly to him, still crying softly on his neck. She was shivering a little despite the night's warmth.  
他们就那样站在那里，紧紧相拥，不敢松手。明日香紧紧抓着他，仍在他的脖颈间轻声啜泣。尽管夜晚温暖，她还是微微颤抖着。  
  
  
  
  
  
Shinji didn't know how to feel. What was happening was simultaneously warming and breaking his heart. Warming because she was there. She came back ! This was already enough for him, and she had told him that she loved him too ! And on top of that, she trusted him enough not to hide how she felt right now. But that was the problem. He had never seen her like this before, she looked so small, so frail. He wanted to comfort her, to protect her from whatever demons were making her cry like this. If only he knew what to do. "It-it's okay. I'm here. We both are. I-I love you." He managed to say, emboldened by her previous declaration. The only response he got were her arms tightening around him almost painfully. She sobbed a bit more powerfully too.  
真嗣不知道该如何感受。眼前的一切既温暖又让他心碎。温暖是因为她在这里。她回来了！这对他来说已经足够了，而且她还告诉他她爱他！更重要的是，她足够信任他，没有隐藏此刻的感受。但问题就在这里。他从未见过她这副模样，她看起来如此娇小，如此脆弱。他想安慰她，保护她免受任何让她哭泣的恶魔侵扰。如果他知道该怎么做就好了。“没关系的。我在这里。我们都在。我……我爱你。”他鼓起勇气说道，受到她之前表白的鼓舞。他得到的唯一回应是她更加用力地抱紧他，几乎有些疼痛。她的哭泣也变得更加强烈。  
  
  
  
  
  
A lot of scenarios had gone through Shinji's head while he had waited for her to read the notebook he had given her a few hours ago. This was not one of them. And he couldn't stand it. He couldn't stand to see her sad like that. He decided, as a consequence, to do anything he could to make her feel better. He squared his shoulders and held her more firmly, his right hand gently caressing her head and hair. How he had missed this !.. How he had missed her. After a month without her he was elated to be able to once again see her, smell her, feel her in his arms. It had been far too long.  
在等待她阅读他几小时前给她的笔记本时，真嗣脑海中闪过了许多情景。但这一幕绝不在其中。他无法忍受。他无法忍受看到她如此悲伤。因此，他决定尽一切可能让她感觉好些。他挺直肩膀，更紧地抱住她，右手温柔地抚摸着她的头和头发。他多么怀念这一切！...他多么怀念她。一个月没有她的日子让他欣喜若狂，终于能再次见到她，闻到她的气息，感受她在怀中。这已经太久了。  
  
  
  
  
  
Yes. He would definitely do anything to cheer her up. She would talk to him when she would be ready, he knew that, and when this would happen, he would help her, he would find a way. In the meantime, the only thing he could do was show her that he was there for her. That he wasn't going anywhere.  
是的。他肯定会尽一切努力让她振作起来。他知道，当她准备好时，她会和他交谈，而那时，他会帮助她，他会找到办法。与此同时，他唯一能做的就是向她展示他就在她身边。他不会离开。  
  
  
  
  
  
"Shinji ?" She called hoarsely once her crying subsided a little.  
“真嗣？”当她的哭泣稍稍平息时，她嘶哑地呼唤了一声。  
  
  
  
  
  
"What is it ?" He gently whispered in her ear.  
“怎么了？”他轻声在她耳边低语。  
  
  
  
  
  
"I want to go to bed." She answered, emotionless. He helped her get comfortable on the bed before leaving her room, without even looking at her and thus missing the desperate gaze she cast on him. He came back a few minutes later with a large glass of water.  
“我想睡觉。”她面无表情地回答。他帮她安顿好在床上，然后离开了她的房间，甚至没有看她一眼，因此错过了她投向他的绝望目光。几分钟后，他带着一大杯水回来了。  
  
  
  
  
  
Asuka's shoulders slumped as relief coursed through her body. She kept silent when she took the glass and brought it to her lips and avidly drank most of it before putting it down on her nightstand while Shinji lied down next to her. She had not realized how thirsty she was. "Thanks." She murmured as she got comfortable close to him, looking him in the eyes, their faces mere centimeters apart, on the same pillow. Despite her bed being large enough for the both of them to sleep rather comfortably, Asuka just refused to release her hold on the Third Child.  
随着一阵解脱感涌遍全身，明日香的肩膀松弛下来。她接过杯子，一言不发地送到唇边，贪婪地喝掉了大部分，然后将杯子放在床头柜上，而真嗣则在她身边躺下。她没有意识到自己有多渴。“谢谢。”她低声说着，靠近他躺下，凝视着他的眼睛，两人的脸相距仅几厘米，共用一个枕头。尽管她的床足够大，足以让他们俩都睡得相当舒适，但明日香就是不肯放开对第三适格者的拥抱。

"Tell me precisely how it happened." Gendo Ikari ordered impassible, his hands folded before his mouth. He had read the report, of course, yet there still were elements to this particular event which eluded him.  
“准确告诉我事情是如何发生的。”碇源堂命令道，面无表情，双手交叠在嘴前。他当然已经读过报告，但这次事件中仍有一些细节让他不解。  
  
  
  
  
  
"Everything we know is in the report I gave you. The whole operation was based on theories and hypotheses. There still are a lot of things we do not know or understand about the Evas." Ritsuko replied. It had been a long day which concluded a long month. She wasn't in the mood to repeat herself.  
“我所知道的一切都写在了给你的报告里。整个行动都是基于理论和假设。关于 EVA，我们还有很多未知和不理解的地方。”律子回答道。这一天漫长无比，也结束了一个漫长的月份。她没心情重复自己说过的话。  
  
  
  
  
  
"What I want to know is how she managed to come back when I specifically told you that this wasn't supposed to happen. I do not appreciate insubordination." Gendo answered threateningly.  
“我想知道的是，在我明确告诉你们这不应发生的情况下，她是怎么回来的。我不容忍不服从。”碇源堂威胁性地回答。

"I did exactly what you ordered." She didn't have to justify herself to him. Her actions in the past years should have been eloquent enough. She had been surprised herself when she saw Asuka's naked form on the gangway close to a crying Misato. She had deliberately slipped incorrect codes here and there, where she knew it would be unlikely for Maya to find out. In several places, to make sure her, no, his objective would be complete. She had followed his orders, as she always did, despite his indifference, despite his disdain for her. 'Can't you understand that she came back because she wanted to ?' She thought with contempt. Recently, her opinion of the Supreme Commander shifted, ever so slightly at first. She had done so much for him, sacrificed so much, only to be disrespected as a scientist and as a woman. "Every relevant information considering my tampering with the operation has been added to the report."  
“我完全按照你的命令行事。”她无需向他证明自己。过去几年的行动本应已足够说明一切。当她看到明日香赤裸着身体在哭泣的美里身旁时，连她自己都感到惊讶。她故意在各处插入错误的代码，明知真希波不太可能发现。在几个关键位置，为了确保她的，不，他的目标得以实现。她一如既往地遵从他的命令，尽管他冷漠无情，尽管他鄙视她。“难道你还不明白她回来是因为她想回来吗？”她轻蔑地想。最近，她对最高指挥官的看法开始微妙地转变。她为他付出了那么多，牺牲了那么多，却只换来作为科学家和女人的不尊重。“所有关于我篡改操作的相关信息都已添加到报告中。”

The Commander moved a little on his chair, his glasses reflecting the eerie light from his office. "You are dismissed. Today's test shall begin shortly." He didn't even spare a look to the open folder on his office.  
指挥官在椅子上微微挪动，眼镜反射出办公室里诡异的光线。“你可以离开了。今天的测试即将开始。”他甚至没有看一眼办公桌上打开的文件夹。

"Yes." "是的。"

.

.

"Asuka's sync ratio has dropped significantly." Maya exclaimed. She had forced herself for a while not to show emotions when she stated those kind of things, but this just wasn't her. She had always been someone who wore her emotions on her sleeve. Too much was at stake here to be detached about what happened. One of NERV's Pilots losing her ability to synchronize with her Eva was a big deal !  
“明日香的同步率大幅下降了。”玛雅惊呼道。她强迫自己一段时间内不要在陈述这类事情时流露情感，但这实在不是她的风格。她一直是个喜怒形于色的人。这里牵扯太多，无法对发生的事情无动于衷。NERV 的一名驾驶员失去与 EVA 同步的能力，这可是大事！

"That was to be expected." Ritsuko reassured her assistant. "It's been a month since she last synchronized with an Eva. Even her own body must feel strange to her right now." She opened a comm channel with Unit 02's Entry Plug. "Asuka ? You have to concentrate."  
“这是预料之中的。”律子安慰她的助手。“她已经有一个月没有与 EVA 同步了。现在她的身体对她来说一定很陌生。”她打开与二号机插入栓的通讯频道。“明日香？你必须集中精神。”

"I'm trying !" Asuka answered angrily. The truth was, she wasn't trying at all. Her mind couldn't have been further away from this sync test as it already was. She had woken up late, still in the arms of the boy she had confessed to the night before, warm and comfortable. The first thing she looked at were his eyes in the dimly lit bedroom. They were full of tenderness and relief. But there was something else. Concern. Worry. His deep blue eyes had always had the power to make her heart skip beats. When she looked at them this morning, she felt that with his help, she would be able to get better.  
“我在努力！”明日香生气地回答。事实上，她根本没在尝试。她的心思早已远离了这次同步测试。她醒来时已经很晚，仍然躺在昨晚向她表白的男孩怀里，温暖而舒适。她第一眼看到的是昏暗卧室中他的眼睛。它们充满了温柔和释然。但还有别的东西。关切。忧虑。他深蓝色的眼睛总是有让她心跳加速的力量。今早看着它们，她觉得有他的帮助，她会变得更好。

This feeling was peculiar to her. She had always prided herself of being independent, of not needing anyone. But being loved, after so long, and realizing her own love for him, had changed that fact... Not that she would admit it to him. Or anyone else.  
这种感觉对她来说是奇特的。她一直以独立自主为傲，认为自己不需要任何人。但被爱了这么久，意识到自己对他的爱，改变了这一点……尽管她不会向他或任何人承认。

He wasn't drowsy with sleep like her, on the contrary, he looked very much awake. He had waited for her to wake up not to disturb her, she assumed. Maybe it wasn't something important in his mind but it meant a lot to her.  
他不像她那样因睡眠而昏昏欲睡，相反，他看起来非常清醒。她猜想，他等她醒来是为了不打扰她。也许在他心里这不是什么重要的事，但对她来说意义重大。

It was Sunday. So they didn't need to go to school, which was a good thing, since she really wasn't in the mood for a boring lesson interspersed with death glares, dumb and tiresome hypocrites wanting to bask in her popularity and love letters from boys who just lusted after her body. This whole menagerie already made her sick at the best of time, now just thinking about them was almost unbearable for her. Not to mention the girls Shinji had talked about ! Those opportunistic harpies ! They would get what they deserved, just not now. Now was the time to enjoy spending time with her boyfriend.  
那天是星期天。所以他们不需要去学校，这倒是件好事，因为她实在没心情去应付那些夹杂着死亡凝视的无聊课程，还有那些愚蠢又烦人的伪君子，想要沐浴在她的人气光环下，以及那些只对她身体垂涎的男生们的情书。这一群乌合之众平时就让她感到恶心，现在光是想到他们就几乎让她难以忍受。更别提真嗣提到过的那些女生了！那些机会主义的悍妇！她们迟早会得到应有的报应，只是不是现在。现在，是时候享受和男朋友共度的时光了。

Yes. She was looking forward to spending the day with Shinji. It was selfish, but she desperately wanted him to alleviate her sadness just by being with her. To feel safe in his arms. To eat whatever he would have prepared for her, she didn't care what, she knew it would have tasted divine. Maybe even watch a movie in his old room.  
是的。她期待着和真嗣共度这一天。虽然自私，但她迫切希望他能仅仅通过陪伴来缓解她的悲伤。在他的怀抱中感到安全。吃他为她准备的食物，无论是什么，她知道那一定会美味无比。也许甚至可以在他旧房间里看一场电影。

All these hopes came crashing down however when the phone rang.  
然而，当电话响起时，所有这些希望都破灭了。

As a consequence, she didn't care at all about this sync test. Furthermore, she didn't want to be in her Eva. What she had seen, or thought she had seen, throughout last month, had left a deeply disturbing impression on her. She wasn't ready to "face" her Eva just yet. She still wasn't sure if she had just hallucinated or if it had indeed been the truth. Whatever it was, she didn't want to verify it just yet.  
因此，她对这次同步测试毫不在意。更甚者，她根本不想进入她的 Eva。上个月她所见到的，或者说她以为自己见到的，给她留下了极其不安的印象。她还没有准备好“面对”她的 Eva。她仍然不确定那究竟是幻觉还是事实。无论是什么，她现在还不想去验证。

That was another reason why she got scolded by Ritsuko. She had closed her heart and mind as soon as she had stepped inside her Entry Plug. She just wanted to be out of there, back home.  
这也是为什么她被律子责骂的另一个原因。她一进入插入栓就封闭了自己的心和思想。她只想离开那里，回到家中。

But even that wasn't in the cards for her. Ritsuko had wanted her to come to her office as soon as the test ended. She just managed to tell Shinji not to wait for her, but she still told him that she wanted a nice dinner ready when she came back. He had promised her a Black forest cake. That was enough to cheer her up, and help her get through this.  
但即便这样也不可能。律子希望她在测试结束后立即去她的办公室。她勉强告诉真嗣不要等她，但还是告诉他希望她回来时能有一顿美味的晚餐。他答应给她做一个黑森林蛋糕。这足以让她振作起来，帮助她度过这一切。

It was already getting dark when she finally got out of the Geofront. 'I'll be home soon. A few more minutes and I'll be with...'  
"当天色已晚，她终于从地底都市出来时，心里想着：‘我很快就能回家了。再过几分钟，我就能和...’”

"Hey Soryu !" Her reverie was interrupted by Toji, who was quickly closing the distance between them.  
“嘿，索留！”她的沉思被东治打断，他正迅速缩短他们之间的距离。

"Hey Monkey-boy !" She greeted back without enthusiasm. "What are you still doing here ?"  
“嘿，猴子男孩！”她无精打采地回应道，“你还在这里做什么？”

"I was with my sister. I go see her every time I'm here." He answered happily, not even noticing Asuka's tone.  
"我和我妹妹在一起。每次来这里我都会去看她。" 他高兴地回答，完全没有注意到明日香的态度。

"You're a devoted brother, Shinji told me about you and your sister. I... Appreciate your... Abnegation." She said truthfully, albeit a bit reluctantly.  
"你是个尽责的哥哥，真嗣跟我提起过你和你妹妹。我……感激你的……无私。" 她诚恳地说，尽管有些不情愿。

"Did I hear that right ?" Toji replied, flabbergasted. "Did you just compliment me ? Are you alright ?"  
"我听错了吗？" 东治震惊地回答。"你刚刚是在夸我吗？你还好吧？"

"Listen." She paused a little to organize her thoughts. "Shinji's told me how hard last month has been on him. You've been there for him... You've helped him when I..." She hesitated for a moment, unsettling the boy in front of her. "Wasn't there. I'm glad you did. You are a good friend to the idiot. Thank you..." She finally managed to say with some effort. "But don't get me wrong ! That doesn't mean I like you !"  
"听着。" 她稍稍停顿，整理思绪。"真嗣告诉我上个月他有多难熬。你一直在他身边... 在我...不在的时候帮助了他。我很高兴你这么做了。你是个好朋友，对那个笨蛋来说。谢谢你..." 她费力地说出这些话，让面前的男孩感到不安。"但别误会！这并不意味着我喜欢你！"

He chuckled. "I sure hope not ! But don't mention it, Demon. It was the least I could do for Shin-Man ! He really was devastated. You know, he really cares about you. And from what I have seen, you might not be so bad for him after all." He trailed off. She was about to leave when he spoke again. "I wanted to thank you too... You know, for saving my life." It was his turn to feel uncomfortable. "I owe you one, and a Suzuhara never forgets his debts !" He paused for a second. "I can see you want to leave, I ain't going to bother you any longer. Take care of Shinji... And yourself. See you tomorrow !"  
他轻笑。"我当然希望不是！不过别客气，恶魔。为真哥做这些是最起码的！他真的很受打击。你知道，他真的很在乎你。而且据我观察，你对他来说也许并不坏。" 他话音渐弱。她正要离开时，他又开口了。"我也想感谢你... 你知道，救了我的命。" 轮到他感到不自在了。"我欠你一个人情，须原永远不会忘记他的债！" 他停顿了一下。"看得出你想走了，我就不再打扰你了。照顾好真嗣... 还有你自己。明天见！"

'Kaji you fool... You were always such a fool !' Misato had been locked up in this dark cell for hours now. She was hungry. She had wanted to finish catching up with her work before grabbing a latish lunch. She was almost done when those Section 2 goons came. The audacity they shown still pissed her off. They were the ones who had messed up letting the Vice Commander get abducted and she was locked up ? She had managed to keep her composure in front of them and inside her cell, mostly, but she was fuming. Last night had not helped, this sync test had really not been necessary, and seeing the distraught look on Asuka's face the whole time she spent in her Entry Plug had left her worried, as a consequence, she had spent a rather short night.  
“加持，你这个傻瓜...你一直都是这么个傻瓜！”美里已经被关在这个黑暗的牢房里好几个小时了。她饿了。本想赶在稍晚些吃午餐前把工作收尾。就在她快完成时，那些第二课的混蛋闯了进来。他们的大胆行径仍让她气愤不已。是他们搞砸了让副指挥官被绑架，而她却被关了起来？她设法在他们面前和牢房里保持镇定，但内心怒火中烧。昨晚的情况也没好转，这个同步测试实在没必要，而且看到明日香在插入栓里全程那副心烦意乱的表情，让她担心不已，结果她只睡了很短的时间。

Kaji couldn't have picked a worst day to play with her nerves. 'Why did you do this ? Don't you think I've got work to do ? And what's the point ? Do you think he'll just tell you everything he knows ? You're an idiot ! If you keep going like this, you'll only manage to get killed !' She let this last thought sink in for a bit. 'Don't get me wrong, I understand... You've always been obsessed by the truth. And I can't blame you for this, I'd really like to know the truth as well !'  
加治选了个最糟糕的日子来挑战她的神经。'你为什么要这么做？你难道不知道我有工作要做吗？这有什么意义？你以为他会把他知道的一切都告诉你吗？你真是个白痴！如果你继续这样下去，你只会让自己丧命！'她让这最后的想法沉淀一会儿。'别误会，我理解……你一直对真相着迷。我不能因此责怪你，我也真的很想知道真相！'

"I need a beer." She let out in the empty room. There was so much in her mind at the moment with all these secrets that she dared to hope that the guard outside would hear her and toss her one. Of course, nobody answered her plea.  
"我需要一杯啤酒。"她在空荡荡的房间里喊道。此刻她的脑海中充斥着太多秘密，她甚至希望外面的守卫能听到她的呼声，扔给她一瓶。当然，没有人回应她的请求。

'We're not so different, you want the truth, I want the Angels dead. But tell me, Kaji, what good is the truth if you're dead ? It hit me recently. I've been living only for revenge since even before I joined NERV. But I'm tired now. I want to live a normal life for Heaven's sake ! And I want... No ! I need you to be a part of it. I learned that thanks to the kids. If they can be happy together why couldn't we ? I know this is selfish, but you know what else is !? Disappearing right after we got back together !' She stood up and kicked the bed she was sitting on "Ow !" Her scream was mixed with the muffled thump made by the impact of her foot with the plank which constituted her bed base. She sat on the ground, her knees to her chest, taking deep breaths to calm herself down. This was getting her nowhere, she couldn't change what was happening, the only thing she could do was get used to the idea. He had already made his decision. 'I swear, if you get yourself killed I'll never forgive you as long as I live !'  
"我们其实没那么不同，你追求真相，我渴望消灭使徒。但告诉我，加持，若你死了，真相又有何用？最近我恍然大悟。自我加入 NERV 前，一直只为复仇而活。但现在我累了。看在上天的份上，我渴望过正常生活！而且我想要...不！我需要你成为其中一部分。多亏了那些孩子，他们能快乐相伴，我们为何不能？我知道这很自私，但你知道还有什么更自私吗？！刚复合就消失无踪！" 她站起身，踢向她坐的床，"哎哟！" 她的尖叫混杂着脚踢床板发出的沉闷声响。她坐在地上，双膝抱胸，深呼吸试图平复情绪。这样下去毫无进展，她改变不了正在发生的事，唯一能做的就是适应这个想法。他已经做出了决定。"我发誓，如果你让自己丧命，我活着一天就不会原谅你！"

She stood up slowly, as if all her strength had left her body and dragged herself back on the bed to lie down on her left side. 'You know, I'm still afraid of the dark. Except when you're with me. Please Kaji, don't die. I'm tired of being miserable, sad and hopeless. ' She wriggled a little, trying to find a more comfortable position.  
她缓缓站起身，仿佛所有的力气都已离她而去，拖着身子回到床上，侧身躺下。'你知道吗，我还是怕黑。但有你在身边就不怕了。请别死，加持。我厌倦了痛苦、悲伤和绝望。' 她扭动了一下，试图找到更舒适的姿势。

It had been far too long since the three roommates had spent a nice and enjoyable evening together. Two Angels had been defeated since the last time, and the last one had attacked over a month ago. Things didn't start well, however, as Shinji seemed to be the only one in a good mood. Things got better as time went on. Shinji's meal helped, but the driving force was that the three of them really needed a break from everything that was happening.  
三位室友已经很久没有共度一个愉快美好的夜晚了。自上次以来，两台使徒已被击败，最后一台使徒也在一个月前发动了攻击。然而，事情一开始并不顺利，因为只有真嗣似乎心情不错。随着时间推移，情况逐渐好转。真嗣的晚餐起了作用，但主要是因为他们三人都需要从发生的一切中暂时解脱出来。

Misato was cheerily intoxicated, celebrating in her own way her reunion with both her young charges. She wasn't completely drunk, just enough to get a small buzz that made her feel jolly. It was also to help her cope with what she knew had happened during the day. She was concerned, but she really wanted to enjoy this moment.  
美里欢快地喝醉了，以自己的方式庆祝与两个年轻保护对象的重聚。她并没有完全醉倒，只是微醺，让她感到愉悦。这也是为了帮助她应对白天发生的事情。她虽然担忧，但真的很想享受这一刻。

Shinji was smiling. He just couldn't help himself. Things were getting back to normal now that Asuka had come back. It was a small, shy smile, but it was there. It was so rare to see him like this that it was bound to have a positive effect on his roommates. However, his eyes betrayed how worried the boy was.  
真嗣在微笑。他情不自禁。如今明日香回来了，一切正逐渐恢复正常。那是一个小小的、羞涩的微笑，但它确实存在。他这样子难得一见，注定会对他的室友们产生积极的影响。然而，他的眼神却透露出男孩内心的忧虑。

Asuka was really, genuinely happy to be there, to share this delicious dinner with them. However, she also looked gloomy. Shinji didn't like that, it was so unlike her to sulk like this... It was more like him, he thought humorlessly. She was doing her best to act like she normally would, but he could see how forced it was. When they were together in their room, she didn't hide it from him. That being said, she didn't talk either. She kept what was eating her up to herself. Shinji didn't want to push her, he knew better, so he said nothing, but he desperately wanted her to tell him, if only to share her burden.  
明日香真的、由衷地高兴能在这里，与他们共享这顿美味的晚餐。然而，她也显得忧郁。真嗣不喜欢这样，她这样闷闷不乐实在不像她……他自嘲地想，这倒更像他自己。她尽力表现得像平时一样，但他看得出那有多勉强。当他们一起在房间里时，她没有对他隐瞒。即便如此，她也没有开口说话。她把困扰自己的事情藏在心底。真嗣不想逼她，他知道怎么做更好，所以他什么也没说，但他迫切希望她能告诉他，哪怕只是分担她的负担。

Things almost got out of hand when Asuka grabbed the last part of the Black forest cake left in the fridge from yesterday's meal. Misato had tasted it the night before. Shinji had thoughtfully left her a plate of yesterday's meal in the fridge, along with a piece of the cake. She had loved it so much that she couldn't resist and tried to snatch it from Asuka the second she had turned her back. It didn't go well. They started arguing and yelling. Shinji had to intervene, as the two women were about to jump at each other's throat. Misato couldn't win against them both, so she let Asuka eat that last piece, but not before making Shinji promise that he would make another one soon.  
当明日香从冰箱里抢走昨天晚餐剩下的最后一块黑森林蛋糕时，事情差点失控。美里在前一晚已经尝过这块蛋糕。真嗣贴心地为她在冰箱里留了一盘昨天的晚餐，还有一块蛋糕。她非常喜欢，以至于忍不住在明日香转身时试图从她手中夺走。结果并不顺利。两人开始争吵和叫喊。真嗣不得不介入，因为两位女士几乎要互相扑向对方。美里无法同时对付她们两个，所以她让明日香吃掉了那最后一块，但在此之前，她让真嗣承诺会尽快再做一块。

.

.

Asuka and Shinji went to bed soon after, while Misato stayed a little longer, doing the dishes. It was her penance for trying to shamelessly steal Asuka's dessert.  
明日香和真嗣不久后便上床睡觉了，而美里则多留了一会儿洗碗。这是她试图无耻地抢夺明日香甜点的惩罚。

Nothing was different between them, yet everything had changed. It had just taken three words. Three little words that they had not said nor heard in far, far too long. They were still in Asuka's bed, as was usual, still snuggling together, arms wrapped around each other.  
他们之间似乎一切如常，却又发生了变化。仅仅因为三个字。这三个字他们已经很久没有说出口，也没有听到。他们依旧像往常一样躺在明日香的床上，依偎在一起，手臂环绕着对方。

"Asuka ?" He whispered delicately. "Do you like Beethoven ?"  
"明日香？" 他轻声细语地问道，"你喜欢贝多芬吗？"

She opened her eyes as an evil smirk appeared on her face. "Why would I like Beethoven ? You say that because I come from Germany ?" She answered, trying her best to sound offended. "You know that's racist, right ?"  
她睁开眼睛，脸上浮现出一丝邪恶的微笑。"我为什么要喜欢贝多芬？你这么说是因为我来自德国吗？" 她尽力装出被冒犯的样子回答，"你知道这是种族歧视吧？"

Shinji squirmed uncomfortably. "I-I... It's just... I mean..." He was completely shocked by what she had just said, that she could even think this of him. He tried, but he was speechless.  
真嗣不安地扭动着身体。"我...我...只是...我的意思是..." 他被她刚才的话完全震惊了，没想到她会这样想他。他试图解释，却哑口无言。

That's when she started laughing. "I was kidding Shinji ! Why are you asking me this ?"  
"就在那时，她开始笑了起来。“我开玩笑的，真嗣！你为什么问我这个？””

Still shocked, but reassured nonetheless he took a few seconds to calm down. "T-There is a tradition here in Japan. In December, there are concerts of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. I wanted to go to a concert with you for..." He trailed off for a second. "For your birthday."  
"尽管仍然震惊，但得到了安慰的他还是花了几秒钟来平复心情。“在日本，有一个传统。每年十二月，都会有贝多芬第九交响曲的音乐会。我想和你一起去听一场音乐会……”他顿了一下。“为了你的生日。””

Asuka loved the idea. She had always loved this symphony and despite, or maybe because of the memories hearing it would bring, she wanted to go. However, she was still feeling playful from her previous joke. "Are you sure that will be enough ?" She said sounding a tad disappointed while looking him right in the eyes in the darkness. "I mean, it's an okay gift, but you seem to forget that now that I came back from Unit 02, one might consider that I have two birthdays."  
"明日香对这个主意很感兴趣。她一直很喜欢这首交响曲，尽管——或者可能正是因为——听到它会勾起一些回忆，她很想一起去。然而，她还在为之前的玩笑感到调皮。“你确定这足够吗？”她在黑暗中直视着他的眼睛，语气略带失望地说。“我是说，这个礼物还算可以，但你似乎忘了，自从我从二号机回来后，有人可能会认为我有两个生日。””

"I... Erm I... Th-that's the only idea I had." He said desperately, trying with all his might not to stutter or sound disappointed himself, and failing spectacularly at both.  
"我...呃...我...这-这是我唯一能想到的主意了。" 他绝望地说道，竭尽全力不让自己结巴或听起来失望，却在两者上都失败得一塌糊涂。

"Relax idiot !" She said smiling kindly to him before kissing him gently on the lips. "That's a wonderful gift. I'd really like to go to this concert." She then laid back down, her head on his chest. He let out the breath he was holding in a sigh of relief. They stayed like this for a moment before Asuka broke the silence. "Stop worrying about me, idiot. I'm fine." Her tone wasn't aggressive though. 'If you stop, I swear I'll kill you with my bare hands.'  
"放松点，笨蛋！" 她微笑着温柔地对他说，然后轻轻地吻了他的嘴唇。"这礼物太棒了。我真的想去这场音乐会。" 她随后躺下，头靠在他的胸膛上。他松了一口气，释放了憋着的呼吸。他们就这样静静地待了一会儿，直到明日香打破了沉默。"别再担心我了，笨蛋。我没事。" 虽然她的语气并不强硬。'如果你停下来，我发誓我会用空手杀了你。'

"How did you know ?" He asked completely taken by surprise. He had done his best not to let it show.  
"你怎么知道的？" 他完全被惊到了。他尽力不让它显露出来。

"I can barely breathe. If you held me any tighter you'd probably break some of my ribs. That kinda gave it away." She couldn't hide her disappointment when he loosened his embrace though. He couldn't see it, thankfully. 'I'm not ready Shinji. I can't tell you why I am who I am and what I saw... Not yet.'  
"我几乎喘不过气来。如果你再抱紧一点，恐怕我的肋骨都要断了。那样就露馅了。" 尽管如此，当他松开怀抱时，她无法掩饰自己的失望。幸好，他看不见。'我还没准备好，真嗣。我无法告诉你我是谁，我看到了什么... 还不能。'

"Sorry." He was feeling disappointed too. He hadn't done it on purpose, but that could have been a good opportunity for her to tell him what was bothering her. 'How can I understand you if you won't say anything ?' He thought sadly. But he didn't have to understand her to help her. He gently caressed her back 'If you don't want to tell me about anything you don't have to. I'll always be there for you.' That's what he had told her when they kissed for the first time.  
"对不起。" 他也感到失望。他并非有意为之，但那本是一个她向他倾诉困扰的好机会。'如果你什么都不说，我怎么理解你呢？' 他悲伤地想。但他不需要理解她才能帮助她。他温柔地抚摸着她的背，'如果你不想告诉我任何事，你不必勉强。我会一直在你身边。' 这是他们第一次接吻时他对她说过的话。

"Idiot." She said tenderly. Maybe it was enough to make him understand. Silence once again enveloped them before she changed the subject. "Why did you go see Wondergirl in the hospital ?"  
"傻瓜。" 她温柔地说。也许这足以让他明白。沉默再次笼罩他们，随后她改变了话题，"你为什么去医院看明日香？"

He fidgeted a little, making her move in unison to keep her comfortable place on his chest. Even having been separated for this long did not change this habit. Because of the contact, of course, and also because they could speak more freely like that than when they were face to face. "Since the nurse didn't know where you were and..." He trailed off before resuming. "And since I was scared to face Toji after what happened, I wanted to make sure that at least she was okay." He snorted humorlessly. "In the end we barely talked about her because I was too preoccupied about you..."  
他轻轻地动了动，让她也随之调整姿势，以保持她在他胸前的舒适位置。即便分离了这么久，这个习惯依旧未变。当然是因为接触的关系，也因为这样他们能比面对面时更自由地交谈。“既然护士不知道你去哪儿了……”他话说到一半又停了下来，然后继续道，“而且我害怕面对真嗣之后发生的事，我想确保至少她没事。”他自嘲地哼了一声，“结果我们几乎没怎么谈她，因为我满脑子都是你……”

She smiled at that last statement. 'Take that, Wondergirl !'  
听到最后那句话，她笑了。'看你还敢不敢，奇迹少女！'

"I feel bad though..." He continued, unaware of what Asuka was thinking. "She's been isolated her whole life, just like me. It's unfair to ostracize her like that."  
“不过我感到很内疚……”他继续说道，没注意到明日香在想什么。“她一生都像我一样孤独，这样排斥她是不公平的。”

The thought had never crossed her mind. She had always disliked the First Child after she had rejected her. She hadn't tried to understand why she was like this. It didn't even cross her mind that she could be just like she used to be, isolated, alone. "Yeah... I guess you're right." She couldn't disagree with him. It indeed was unfair, nobody deserves to live a life of loneliness. Her smile vanished when she said that. She was about to continue when the sound of something heavy scraping on the floor made them both jump. They were about to shrug it off when they heard desperate wailing through the paper thin door.  
这个念头从未在她脑海中闪现过。自从被她拒绝后，她一直不喜欢这位第一子。她从未试图理解她为何如此。她甚至没有想过，她可能就像过去的自己一样，孤独、孤立。“嗯……我想你说得对。”她无法反驳他。这确实不公平，没有人应该过孤独的生活。当她说出这话时，她的笑容消失了。她正要继续说下去，突然一阵沉重的刮擦声让他们俩都跳了起来。他们正要置之不理，却听到透过薄薄的门传来的绝望哭声。

They got on their feet and rushed outside of the bedroom. The sight that greeted them broke their heart. Misato was kneeling in the kitchen, her elbows resting on the table, she was cradling her head in her arms. She was crying and shouting in front of the telephone, oblivious to the rest of the world. Her body shook with each powerful sob. She didn't even move when a hand gently squeezed her shoulder. Shinji and Asuka came on each side of her in an attempt to support her.  
他们站起身来，冲出卧室。眼前的一幕让他们心碎。美里跪在厨房里，手肘撑在桌上，用双臂抱着头。她对着电话哭泣喊叫，完全无视周围的世界。每一次强烈的抽泣都让她的身体颤抖。即使一只手轻轻地握住她的肩膀，她也没有动弹。真嗣和明日香分别走到她两侧，试图支持她。

"Misato ?What's going on ?" Asked Asuka worriedly. She didn't answer, she didn't even seem to realize that they were here with her. Her body kept rocking violently as she continued crying. Hesitantly, scared as if the answering machine would burn his finger, Shinji pushed the button to replay the message. Asuka raised her head in shock as she heard the voice belonging to the person who had left the message and as understanding dawned in her mind.  
“美里？发生什么事了？”明日香担忧地问道。她没有回答，甚至似乎没有意识到他们和她在一起。她的身体继续剧烈摇晃，哭泣不止。犹豫不决，害怕得仿佛答录机会烧伤他的手指，真嗣按下了重播按钮。明日香震惊地抬起头，当她听到留下信息的人的声音，理解逐渐在她脑海中清晰。

"Katsuragi, it's me. I'm sure you're listening to this message, especially after I caused you so much trouble. Sorry. Please tell Ritsuko I'm sorry too. Oh, and there's one more thing. I've been growing watermelons. I'd appreciate if you could water them for me. Asuka knows where they are. Katsuragi, take care of the kids, I'll have to lay low for a while. If I see you again, I'll say the words that I couldn't say eight years ago. Bye."  
“葛城，是我。我确信你正在听这条留言，尤其是在我给你惹了这么多麻烦之后。对不起。请告诉律子我也道歉。哦，还有一件事。我在种西瓜。如果你能帮我浇浇水，我会很感激的。明日香知道它们在哪里。葛城，照顾好孩子们，我得低调一段时间。如果我们再见，我会说出八年前没能说出口的话。再见。”

This message was recorded at 12:02 PM.  
这条留言录制于下午 12 点 02 分。

"He's gone." It was almost imperceptible, but the Children heard it, and it shook them to the core. Misato had stopped shouting as soon as she heard Kaji's voice mail, just to hear his voice again. Asuka squatted next to her, she couldn't say anything, so she looked in her sorrowful eyes, her own glimmering with unshed tears. Shinji's hand squeezed the grieving woman's shoulder a bit tighter. "He abandoned me. All for the sake of his stupid quest for truth..." She trailed off, looking away from Asuka, in the distance.  
"他走了。" 这句话几乎微不可闻，但孩子们听到了，它深深震撼了他们。美里一听到加持的语音留言，就停止了呼喊，只为再次听到他的声音。明日香蹲在她旁边，无法说出任何话，只是凝视着她悲伤的双眼，自己的眼中也闪烁着未落的泪光。真嗣的手更紧地握住了这位悲痛女子的肩膀。"他抛弃了我。全都是为了他那愚蠢的追求真相的使命..." 她渐渐停下，避开明日香的目光，望向远方。

"... We... We're going to a concert in a few days. W-would you like to join us ?" It was lame and he knew it, he just couldn't find anything else to say. Maybe it would take her mind off this. Asuka glared at him when she heard his question, she didn't want anyone to come with them. Her wordless reprimand died as a tired sigh escaped her guardian's mouth.  
"... 我们... 我们几天后要去听音乐会。你-你想和我们一起去吗？" 这话很蹩脚，他自己也知道，只是找不到其他可说的。也许这能让她暂时忘却这一切。明日香听到他的提议时瞪了他一眼，她不希望任何人加入他们。她的无声责备随着监护人疲惫的叹息而消散。

"... I'd like that." Was all she said, without inflexion, still staring at nothing, her Children's presence soothed her mind, it reminded her that despite Kaji's absence, she wasn't alone. She was still crying, albeit silently now. She couldn't stop crying even if she had wanted to. This pain, even if it were alleviated by her wards, was too much.  
“……我愿意那样。”她毫无起伏地说道，依旧凝视着虚无，孩子们的存在抚慰了她的心灵，提醒她尽管加持不在，她并不孤单。她仍在哭泣，尽管现在是无声的。即使她想停止，也无法止住泪水。这份痛苦，即便有孩子们的慰藉，也太过沉重。

Shinji felt powerless. He hated that feeling. He could get inside a giant robot and fight against ungodly monsters, yet he was incapable of helping the woman who had helped him on so many occasions. He wanted to help her so much. That's at this moment that he realized that despite everything, he was still just a child. That didn't mean that he would let Misato face this tragedy alone, though. Silently, he moved away from them to prepare some coffee for everyone, this night was going to be long.  
真嗣感到无能为力。他讨厌这种感觉。他可以进入巨大的机器人与不可名状的怪物战斗，却无法帮助那位多次帮助过他的女性。他非常想帮助她。就在这时，他意识到尽管经历了那么多，自己仍然只是一个孩子。但这并不意味着他会让美里独自面对这场悲剧。他默默地离开他们，去为大家准备咖啡，今夜将会很漫长。

Asuka, still crouched next to Misato, took her hand, a bit too roughly and motioned with her head for her guardian to stand up. Her jaw was clenched, she had a deep frown on her face. They got up and walked to the living room. Misato sat on the couch while Asuka plopped herself down angrily on a pillow on the ground cross-legged, still frowning in a -very- angry scowl, a dark and cold stare adorning her features. Neither of them talked, they just sat there, alone together, thinking about the message, its owner, and what it meant.  
明日香依旧蹲在美里旁边，用力地握住她的手，示意她站起来。她的下巴紧绷，脸上带着深深的皱眉。两人起身走向客厅。美里坐在沙发上，而明日香则气呼呼地盘腿坐在地上的一个枕头上，依旧皱着眉头，脸上挂着非常愤怒的怒容，眼神阴冷而冷漠。她们都没有说话，只是静静地坐在那里，孤独地相伴，思考着那条信息、它的主人以及它意味着什么。

A few minutes later, Shinji joined them, a tray in his hands with three mugs on it. He had prepared Misato a simple strong coffee with two sugars, her favorite. He gave Asuka a latte, her favorite hot beverage as well. He had thought about fixing himself some tea, but thought coffee would be better, the bitterness of the liquid would go well with the mood, he gloomily thought. He had served each of them in their favorite mugs, hoping that this simple attention would at least help a little. When he gave her her latte, he brushed discreetly her hand to try and relax Asuka, who was looking angrier by the minute.

They spent most of the time in silence, just drinking their coffees, sometimes talking a little. Asuka never spoke a word, however. After having finished her coffee, Misato seemed almost calm, resigned. "I'm going to take a shower." She said, deadpan, in fact, she sounded empty. Nobody acquiesced. She left without uttering another word.  
他们大部分时间都沉默着，只是喝着咖啡，偶尔聊上几句。然而，明日香一句话也没说。喝完咖啡后，美里似乎变得几乎平静，顺从。“我去洗个澡。”她面无表情地说，实际上，她的声音听起来空洞。没有人回应。她一言不发地离开了。

"Asuka ? Talk to me." Shinji had waited for Misato to leave before asking his girlfriend to share what she was feeling.  
“明日香？跟我说说。”真嗣等美里离开后，才请求他的女朋友分享她的感受。

"Drop it." She sounded furious. The kind of calm fury that always sent shivers down Shinji's spine. He flinched, but didn't back away. He heard the water stream from the bathroom.  
“别提了。”她的声音听起来很愤怒。那种平静的愤怒总是让真嗣脊背发凉。他畏缩了一下，但没有退缩。他听到了浴室里传来的水流声。

"No. I can see you're angry, tell me what's going..."  
"不，我能看出你在生气，告诉我发生了什么..."

"Leave me alone !" She shouted. Her anger finally winning over her restraint. This message had been the last straw. She had already enough to deal with ever since coming back from Unit 02. "Kaji abandoned me too ! Just like everyone else before him ! Just like Mama !" Tears were coming dangerously close to falling down from her deep blue eyes full of anger. "You're gonna abandon me too so you might as well do it right now !"  
"别管我！" 她喊道。她的愤怒终于战胜了克制。这条消息成了压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草。自从从二号机回来后，她已经受够了。"加持也抛弃了我！就像之前的每个人一样！就像妈妈一样！" 泪水危险地在她充满怒火的深蓝色眼睛中打转。"你也会抛弃我的，所以你干脆现在就做吧！"

"No." He said trying to sound as confident as possible. He was scared, and unsettled by what she had just said, but now was not the time for that. He stood up and came close to her. He knelt down to try and hug her, only to receive a violent right hook in the face for his trouble. He fell on his side and held his bruised cheek with his left hand for a few seconds, trying vainly to stop his head from spinning. Yet he didn't back off, he wouldn't run away like last time she hit him, so he came back to her and took her in her arms as quickly as possible, effectively preventing her from punching him again. She struggled for a while with little strength. A part of her wanted nothing to do with him at the moment, but the other part just screamed at her to let him hold her. She finally settled down and slumped in his arms, her head dropped on his shoulder. She weakly raised her arms to return the embrace, clutching his shirt desperately. "Asuka, I couldn't abandon you even if I wanted to. I'm far too scared of you to do that."  
“不。”他尽力让自己的声音听起来尽可能自信。他感到害怕，她刚才的话让他心神不宁，但此刻并非为此分心之时。他站起身，靠近她。他跪下试图拥抱她，却因此挨了一记猛烈的右勾拳。他侧身倒地，用左手捂着淤青的脸颊，几秒钟内徒劳地试图止住头晕。然而他没有退缩，他不会像上次她打他时那样逃跑，于是他迅速回到她身边，紧紧抱住她，有效地阻止了她再次挥拳。她挣扎了一会儿，但力气微弱。一部分的她此刻不愿与他有任何瓜葛，但另一部分却在尖叫着让她让他拥抱。最终，她平静下来，瘫软在他怀里，头靠在他的肩上。她无力地抬起双臂回抱，紧紧抓住他的衬衫。“明日香，即使我想，我也无法抛弃你。我太怕你了，不敢那么做。”

She laughed, finally letting go of some of her tension in the comfort of his arms. "Not scared enough, obviously... You're okay ?" She asked when what she had done hit her, concern evident in her voice. She felt reassured by the fact that he was still holding her close to him, he wouldn't had he been mad at her. That wasn't a reason to make it a habit, however. It was the second time she had hit him, the second time she had lost control. She didn't want to wake up alone one day because of her temper, and she knew this would eventually happen if she wasn't able to control herself.  
她笑了，终于在他的怀抱中放松了一些紧张。“显然还不够害怕……你还好吗？”当她意识到自己做了什么时，关切之情溢于言表。她感到安心，因为他依然紧紧抱着她，如果他生气了，是不会这样的。然而，这并不是养成习惯的理由。这是她第二次打他，第二次失控。她不想因为自己的脾气而有一天醒来时独自一人，她知道如果不能控制自己，这终将发生。

"Oh this ?" He said in a light tone. "It's nothing. You should see the other guy !" They both laughed against each other. The joke wasn't very good, but in their state of mind, it was as if it had been the best joke they had ever heard. They stayed like this a moment before Shinji stood up and went to the kitchen to prepare three more coffees. Asuka never stopped looking at him.  
“哦，这个吗？”他用轻松的语气说，“没什么。你应该看看另一个人！”他们相视而笑。这个笑话并不高明，但在他们当时的心境下，仿佛成了他们听过的最好的笑话。他们就这样待了一会儿，然后真嗣起身去厨房再准备三杯咖啡。明日香始终注视着他。

When Misato came out of the bathroom, a hot coffee was waiting for her on the coffee table. She didn't even notice Shinji's red and slightly swollen left cheek as she slouched unceremoniously on the couch. "Well... Happy birthday to me."  
当美里从浴室出来时，咖啡桌上已经为她准备了一杯热咖啡。她毫无顾忌地瘫坐在沙发上，甚至没注意到真嗣左脸颊的红肿。“好吧……祝我生日快乐。”

### Chapter 13 Picture in a frame
It's me again ! With a new chapter ! Enjoy !  
又是我！带着新章节来啦！尽情享受吧！

The last updates are going pretty slow, I'm enjoying the time I have between the Angels, things will be getting more fast-paced from this point !  
最近的更新进展相当缓慢，我很享受在使徒之间的这段时光，从现在开始事情会变得更加快节奏！

The room he was in was pitch black and large enough to remain cool despite the post Second Impact perpetual summer's heat. The air was stale, however, courtesy of the lack of air conditioning, or windows for that matter, in the room.  
他所在的房间漆黑一片，空间足够大，即使在第二次冲击后永久的夏日酷暑中也能保持凉爽。然而，由于房间内缺乏空调或窗户，空气显得沉闷。

His chair was uncomfortable, especially since he had been sitting on it for hours. His handcuffs would undeniably leave marks if they had not already bruised his flesh. He wasn't sure, he couldn't check with his own eyes. His hands were numb due to his restraints obstructing his bloodstream. So he just sat there, waiting to be released or executed by his captors. He didn't really mind either way anymore. All these machinations, all these schemes were making him weary. Especially in the last months. Especially when the last remaining shards of humanity, that he had thought were long gone, manifested themselves, makings things he had repressed for years awaken and stir inside him.  
他的椅子很不舒服，尤其是他已经坐了好几个小时。手铐无疑会留下痕迹，如果还没有在他的皮肤上留下淤青的话。他不确信，他自己无法查看。由于束缚阻碍了血液循环，他的双手已经麻木。所以他只是坐在那里，等待着被释放或被他的俘虏处决。他现在对这两种结果都不太在意了。所有这些阴谋，所有这些计划都让他感到疲惫。尤其是在过去的几个月里。尤其是当他以为早已消失的人性最后碎片显现出来时，那些他多年来压抑的事情在他内心苏醒并搅动。

Regret ? Guilt ? The manifestation of his conscience ? Whatever it was, it was now impossible to ignore for the benefit of the Scenario. Torturing children had always been part of it, he knew. He had accepted that. In theory, it had been acceptable, the reality was quite different. Seeing Yui's offspring's dedication to the Second Child had reminded him of how he used to be... Before he decided to follow the man who wanted to prevent humanity from being able to make its own decisions. If, even after being manipulated into being incapable of forming any deep connexion with any other human being, Shinji Ikari had managed to find some semblance of happiness, maybe a world where people live, no matter how stained with sin it was, was not such a bad thing.  
后悔？内疚？良心的体现？无论那是什么，现在为了剧本的利益已无法忽视。他知道，折磨孩子一直是其中的一部分。他接受了这一点。理论上，这可以接受，但现实却截然不同。看到 Yui 的后代对第二适格者的奉献，让他想起了自己曾经的模样……在他决定追随那个想要阻止人类自主决策的人之前。即使在被操纵得无法与任何人建立深厚联系之后，碇真嗣仍能找到些许幸福的影子，或许一个无论多么罪孽深重却仍有人生存的世界，也并非那么糟糕。

There would be no salvation for him, he had no illusions about that. He could have ran away to hide somewhere, or he could have died with his honor intact. He had chosen a third option, he had chosen to survive, which could be considered brave or cowardly, depending on the point of view, and so he had to face the consequences, yet said consequences were about to get even more extreme, as his superior was already coming up with ways to set the Scenario back on its tracks. He knew what that meant. The collateral damages that were the Children were going to be the prime victims of the Scenario's alterations. This thought alone made him flinch. There was no saving his soul anymore, but maybe, just maybe, he could do something to try to atone for his past cowardice, something to maybe set things right.  
对他而言，救赎已无可能，对此他心知肚明。他本可以选择逃离藏匿，或是带着尊严死去。然而，他选择了第三条路，选择了生存，这或许勇敢，亦或懦弱，全凭旁观者视角而定。因此，他必须面对随之而来的后果，而这些后果正变得愈发极端，因为他的上级已经在设法让“剧本”重回正轨。他深知这意味着什么。作为附带损害的孩子们，将成为“剧本”调整的首要牺牲品。仅是这一念头就让他畏缩。他的灵魂已无法得救，但或许，仅仅是或许，他可以做些什么来弥补过去的怯懦，尝试纠正一些错误。

If Yui was aware of what was happening to her child, and what was about to happen to him, she would probably destroy each and every person involved in the Human Instrumentality Project, her ex-husband and himself included, he thought.  
他想，如果 Yui 知道她的孩子正在经历什么，以及即将遭遇什么，她大概会摧毁参与人类补完计划的每一个人，包括她的前夫和他自己。

His musings were interrupted by a light which forced him to shut his eyes for a second before he turned his head, not showing any emotion. "Oh, it's you."  
他的沉思被一道强光打断，迫使他闭上眼睛片刻，随后他转过头，面无表情地说：“哦，是你。”

"Long time no see." The silhouette answered before approaching him. "I've put the guards outside to sleep for a while."  
"好久不见。" 那个身影回答着，向他靠近。"我已经让外面的守卫暂时睡着了。"

"This will cost you your life." He said as Kaji knelt behind him to remove his handcuffs.  
"这会让你付出生命的代价。" 他说着，卡吉跪在他身后，开始解开他的手铐。

"All I want is for the kids to be safe." Kaji answered in his usual nonchalant tone as the cuffs fell noisily on the ground. Fuyutsuki was glad to feel blood pumping freely through his hands after so long.  
"我只希望孩子们能安全。" 卡吉用他一贯的漫不经心的语气回答，手铐咔嗒一声掉在地上。冬月感到久违的血液自由流动在双手中，感到欣慰。

"This is a noble and selfless cause. Your enemies are powerful, however." He replied deadpan. It wasn't a threat, just an assessment of the situation his interlocutor was in. He massaged his wrists as he stood up.  
"这是一项崇高而无私的事业。不过，你的敌人很强大。" 他面无表情地回答。这不是威胁，只是对他对话者所处情况的评估。他站起来，按摩着手腕。

The response was peculiar, coming from the Sub Commander, and Kaji realized it. "I sure could use informations." It was risky, but it had been his plan when he decided to come and free Fuyutsuki from SEELE's grasp. So he asked him, there was no use beating about the bush with this man.  
副司令的回答很奇怪，加持意识到了这一点。"我确实需要一些情报。" 这很冒险，但这是他决定来救出被 SEELE 控制的冬月时的计划。所以他直接问他，和这个人兜圈子没有意义。

"Maybe you and I should have a talk." He declared as they both walked out of the room. "Not here, though."  
"也许你我应该谈谈。" 他们一起走出房间时，他宣布道。"但不是在这里。"

"Just tell me this. Why ?" Kaji couldn't hold back his curiosity. His plan was working, or seemed to at least, but he wanted to understand. He looked around a corner to make sure their path was clear. It would have been a shame to get caught now that things seemed to be looking up.  
“就告诉我这个，为什么？”加持忍不住好奇心。他的计划似乎正在奏效，但他想要理解其中的缘由。他探头看向拐角，确保前方道路畅通无阻。现在事情似乎有了转机，要是此刻被抓可就太遗憾了。

"Let's just say the end might not justify the means anymore." Fuyutsuki stated as calmly as always. He didn't want Kaji to know what he really felt. Anticipation. Apprehension. He was also feeling a little like a rat deserting the ship, now that the Scenario was compromised. It didn't matter, however, he should have never been on this ship to begin with. He was a professor. A man supposed to teach youngsters, to help them. Not torture them psychologically. This endeavor was going to be taxing for the old man, nevertheless, he couldn't stay idle anymore. He was one of the few people who might be able to make a difference. This would have to be enough for now. He had been granted a second chance. He wasn't sure he deserved it, however, he was determined to make it count.  
“这么说吧，或许结果已不再能证明手段的正当性。”冬月一如既往平静地说道。他不想让加持知道他真正的感受——期待与忧虑交织。他也觉得自己像是在弃船而逃，毕竟计划已经受挫。然而，这无关紧要，他本就不该登上这艘船。他是一名教授，一个本应教导年轻人、帮助他们的人，而不是对他们进行心理折磨。尽管这项任务对这位老人来说将极为艰巨，但他不能再袖手旁观了。他是少数几个可能产生影响的人之一。眼下，这已足够。他获得了第二次机会。他不确定自己是否配得上，但他决心要让它变得有意义。

They left the building in silence, their footsteps resonating in the empty hallways, accompanied only by the cicadas.  
他们默默地离开了大楼，脚步声在空荡的走廊里回响，只有蝉鸣相伴。

.

.

They eventually went to bed. Both of them had been trying for the past hours to simply stay awake, their eyes closing for a little longer every time they closed them, the effort required to open them again more important each time. Neither of them wanted to leave Misato alone for the remainder of the night. She was forced in the end to order them to go to bed, reminding them that they had to go to school on the next day. The three of them had just been sitting there in silence for the last hours anyway, so there was little to no point in them staying in the living room, Misato thought, even though she was glad for the silent comfort her charges gave her. She did not thank them, there was no point. And she was too absorbed in her own thoughts to think about politeness.  
他们最终还是去睡了。过去几个小时里，两人都只是勉强保持清醒，每次闭眼的时间越来越长，再次睁开眼所需的努力也越来越大。谁都不想让美里独自度过剩下的夜晚。最后，美里不得不命令他们去睡觉，提醒他们第二天还得上学。其实过去几个小时里，三个人只是静静地坐在那里，所以美里觉得他们留在客厅也没什么意义，尽管她很感激他们无声的陪伴。她没有向他们道谢，因为那毫无意义。而且她正沉浸在自己的思绪中，无暇顾及礼节。

Ever since Misato got out of the shower, Shinji had been racking his brain to try, without success, to find a gift for his guardian until he couldn't resist anymore and fell asleep with Asuka in his arms, who had already been sleeping for a while. He smiled a little when he managed to see her peaceful expression as she moved from her usual spot close to his heart. She looked peaceful, which soothed him a little. She hadn't really been herself since coming back. She was her usual self most of the time, but sometimes it seemed forced, even more than usual. And there were those moments when she wasn't even trying. These moments scared him the most. She would either openly slump as if she were overwhelmed by whatever was eating at her or she would simply be completely out of it. Either way, Shinji hated seeing her like this, so he was glad to see her get some respite from her demons when she was sleeping.  
自从美里洗完澡出来后，真嗣就一直绞尽脑汁试图为他的监护人找到一份礼物，却始终未能成功，最终他再也抵挡不住困意，在怀里抱着已经熟睡了一会儿的明日香的情况下睡着了。当他设法看到她从平时紧贴他心口的位置移开时那平静的表情，他微微一笑。她看起来很安宁，这让他稍感宽慰。自从回来后，她并没有真正恢复到自己。大多数时候她还是平时的她，但有时显得有些勉强，甚至比平时更甚。还有那些她甚至不尝试的时刻。这些时刻最让他害怕。她要么会明显地瘫软，仿佛被困扰她的事情压垮，要么就完全心不在焉。无论哪种情况，真嗣都不愿看到她这样，所以看到她在睡梦中暂时摆脱内心的困扰，他感到欣慰。

As usual, they had not paid attention to their old teacher droning about Second Impact, however, this time it was for very different reasons. Asuka was sulking about everything that was happening to her since coming back from Unit 02, while Shinji was still trying to come up with an idea, barely paying attention to all of his surroundings. He had to find it, to find something that would cheer her up, it was the least he could do. There were just too many things going wrong at the moment for him not to do anything. And he could do nothing to help Asuka. He had tried, and was still trying, but he couldn't reach her. He didn't know if she didn't want him to or if she just wasn't ready.  
一如既往，他们并未留意老教师关于第二次冲击的喋喋不休，然而这次的原因却截然不同。自从从二号机归来后，明日香对周遭发生的一切都闷闷不乐，而真嗣则仍在苦思冥想，几乎没怎么注意周围的一切。他必须找到些什么，找到能让她振作起来的东西，这是他起码能做的。眼下有太多事情出了差错，他不能什么都不做。而他却无法帮助明日香。他尝试过，也仍在尝试，却始终无法触及她。他不知道是她不愿让他接近，还是她还没准备好。

For her part, she had been forced by Shinji to add frustration to the -too- long list of things that were bothering her. She hated that he was not giving her his complete attention as he had been doing for the past months. Nonetheless, she understood. She had started to like Misato more and more as time went by, and she had to admit that she liked living with her, despite how much of a slob she was. She didn't like to see her completely desperate as she had been the previous night. She was used to seeing Misato being cheerful and annoying ! So she let Shinji try to comfort her, since she knew she wouldn't be able to do it, it was just not her thing.  
对于她来说，被真嗣逼着在已经够长的烦恼清单上又添了一笔——沮丧。她讨厌他不像过去几个月那样全神贯注地对待她。尽管如此，她还是理解。随着时间的推移，她开始越来越喜欢美里，尽管她是个邋遢鬼，但她不得不承认与她同住的感觉不错。她不喜欢看到美里像前一晚那样彻底绝望。她习惯了看到美里开朗又烦人的样子！所以她让真嗣去安慰美里，因为她知道自己做不到，这不是她的强项。

The answer to Shinji's conundrum was so simple that he couldn't believe how long it took him to find it. The last hours of class were like torture to him. He couldn't stop fidgeting on his seat, waiting for the bell to ring to be able to reveal his grand plan to Asuka. Seeing him like this made her feel a little better, his unfamiliar enthusiasm had contaminated her as soon as he had told her what their present to their guardian was. And despite the fact that he had been the one who found the idea, he kept telling her it was their gift. She had to admit, it was really good. All they had to do was buy a frame and wait to see the look on Misato's face.  
解决真嗣难题的方法简单到他不敢相信自己花了这么久才找到。最后几节课对他来说如同煎熬。他坐在座位上不停地动来动去，等待着下课铃响，好向明日香展示他的宏伟计划。看到他这样，她感觉好多了，他那不寻常的热情在他告诉她给监护人的礼物是什么时就已经感染了她。尽管是他想出的主意，他却一直说是他们共同的礼物。她不得不承认，这确实很棒。他们只需要买个相框，然后等着看美里脸上的表情。

She couldn't hold back the tears when she unwrapped the now framed picture. It was a simple black frame with a photo which had been taken at the hot springs, one of the few ones that had immortalized the three of them, and Pen Pen, of course ! Shinji didn't even remember its existence until, thinking about all the time he had spent with Misato, he remembered looking at a camera's lens back at the Onsen.  
当她拆开装裱好的照片时，泪水止不住地流了下来。那是一个简单的黑色相框，里面是一张在温泉拍的照片，为数不多记录了他们三人——当然还有企鹅 Pen Pen——的照片！直到回想起与美里共度的时光，真嗣才记起自己在温泉时曾对着镜头看过。

Misato was at the center of the photo, holding the penguin tightly in her arms. She was surrounded by her charges. On her right was Shinji, a shy, embarrassed smile on his face. He looked like he was trying to make himself a small as possible, without leaving the frame, because he knew Misato wouldn't have let him get away with it. That didn't mean he didn't try, since he was a bit further away from Misato than Asuka, who was on her left, winking while making the peace sign with her right hand. She had been in a good mood after having killed the Eighth Angel... Still being alive didn't hurt either.  
照片中央是美里，她紧紧抱着那只企鹅。周围是她的孩子们。右边是真嗣，脸上带着羞涩尴尬的微笑。他看起来尽量让自己显得渺小，又不离开镜头，因为他知道美里不会允许他这么做。但这并不意味着他没有尝试，因为他比美里左边的明日香离她稍远一些，明日香正眨眼并用右手比出和平的手势。她在击杀了第八使徒后心情大好……依然活着也让她感到愉悦。

The picture represented a simpler time, far from the schemes and the brutality of Humans and Angels alike. Their efficiency at the time made them think they were invincible, that this war could be won. They all carried their own burdens, of course, but they didn't feel as overwhelming as right now. They felt like they could be, if not dealt with immediately, at least put aside until the time was right.  
这张照片象征着一段更简单的时光，远离了人类和使徒的阴谋与残酷。那时的他们效率极高，让他们觉得自己战无不胜，这场战争可以胜利。当然，他们各自都背负着负担，但那些负担并没有现在这样沉重。他们觉得即使不能立即解决，至少可以暂时搁置，等待合适的时机。

But this picture meant so much more. It meant that no matter what life would throw at them, from falling into an active volcano to the disappearance of a loved one, they could always rely on each other. This picture was to become a reminder of that simple yet paramount fact. It needed no explanation. They all understood the underlying message.  
但这张照片意味着更多。它意味着无论生活向他们抛来什么，从坠入活火山到所爱之人的消失，他们总能相互依靠。这张照片将成为这一简单却至关重要事实的提醒。它无需解释。他们都明白其中的深层含义。

Misato, not able to control herself anymore (not that she tried very much), crushed both Asuka and Shinji in her arms, and for once, they both felt genuinely happy to be victims of one of Misato's bear hugs. Soon, the three of them were enjoying a nice group hug which only helped consolidate the bond between them. Eventually, Misato released her wards only to go hang the picture in the living room, so they would be able to see it every time they would need it. Now all they had to do was prepare for the concert.  
美里再也控制不住自己（其实她也没怎么努力），将明日香和真嗣紧紧拥入怀中，而这一次，他们俩都真切地感受到了成为美里熊抱受害者的幸福。很快，三人享受着温馨的团体拥抱，这进一步巩固了他们之间的纽带。最终，美里松开了她的孩子们，只是为了去把照片挂在客厅，这样他们每次需要时都能看到它。现在他们要做的就是准备音乐会了。

As she got ready, which meant changing out of her school uniform and putting clothes that were more suited for the occasion, Asuka couldn't help but feel jealous. She wanted the same comfort Shinji was giving Misato with that picture. That damn picture that was almost mocking her. They all were there for each other. She knew that. She knew that Shinji was there for her, he would help her in a heartbeat with what she saw in Unit 02... With what happened to her when she was younger. He would understand. He was the only one who could understand. All she had to do was tell him... And that was the problem. This frustrated her to no end, she wanted to. She just couldn't. She still wasn't ready. It was stupid, she was getting more withdrawn every day, so it was getting harder and harder to tell him. And she knew that one day, he wouldn't even be there anymore to listen to her if she continued like this.  
当她准备换下校服，穿上更适合场合的衣物时，明日香忍不住感到一阵嫉妒。她渴望得到那份由真嗣通过那张照片给予美里般的安慰。那该死的照片几乎像是在嘲弄她。他们彼此都互相支持，她知道这一点。她明白真嗣会为她挺身而出，他会毫不犹豫地帮助她面对在二号机中看到的那些...以及她年幼时经历的那些事。他会理解的，他是唯一能理解的人。她只需告诉他...而这正是问题所在。这让她无比沮丧，她想这么做，却做不到。她还没准备好。这很愚蠢，她每天都在变得更加封闭，因此越来越难以向他倾诉。她知道，如果继续这样下去，总有一天，他甚至不会再在那里聆听她了。

It was gnawing at her. She wanted to explode, to break everything and scream at everyone unlucky enough to cross her path, to drive them away so she could enjoy her downward spiral alone, in peace. The only reason that made her control her anger was Shinji, who, despite also being one of the reasons for her current state of mind, was also the only reason for her not falling apart. 'I'm glad you're there, idiot, but we both know I don't deserve it.' She hated him right now. Because he wasn't running away. Because he was there for her. He was forcing her not to be her egotistical and selfish self. And she loved him as much as she hated him because of that.  
这念头在她心头啃噬。她想要爆发，想要砸碎一切，对那些不幸撞上她枪口的倒霉蛋尖叫，赶走他们，好让自己独自享受这堕落的宁静。唯一让她克制怒火的原因是真嗣，尽管他也是她此刻心境的缘由之一，却也是她不至于崩溃的唯一理由。'有你在真好，傻瓜，但我们俩都知道我不配。'她此刻恨他。因为他没有逃避。因为他陪在她身边。他逼迫她不要成为那个自负又自私的自己。她爱他，正如她恨他一样，正是因为这些。

However, she realized quickly that there were only two ways this could go. He would either help her through all this until she got better, or she would drag him down with her. She didn't want that, she wanted him to be happy, or at least she didn't want to be responsible for his woes, and she hated thinking like that. It would have been so much easier if she didn't care about him. She forced her eyes shut and took a deep breath.  
然而，她很快意识到这件事只有两种可能。要么他帮她度过这一切直到她好转，要么她拖他一起沉沦。她不希望那样，她希望他快乐，或者至少她不想成为他痛苦的根源，她讨厌这样想。如果她不在乎他就简单多了。她强迫自己闭上眼睛，深吸一口气。

"One runs the risk of crying a bit if one allows oneself to be tamed." She chuckled cynically, thinking back to this quote from the Little Prince. She had never expected to be in the fox's shoes one day when she read that book when she was younger.  
“如果一个人让自己被驯服了，那他难免会流泪。”她嘲讽地笑了笑，回想起《小王子》中的这句话。她从未想过有一天自己会站在狐狸的位置上，当她年轻时读到那本书的时候。

Being like this was getting on her nerves. She wasn't even sure of what she had seen inside Unit 02, how come it affected her so much ? And how could she verify it ? She couldn't ask her Eva, it was just a weapon, how could it answer her ? Did she really want to know ? It would probably take time, but she knew she could do like she always did if she wanted to, bury it as deep as she could and never think about it again. Then she'd be able to get back to her normal self. She wouldn't admit it to herself, but she was scared. Scared that what she had seen inside Unit 02 was the truth. Because if it were, it would mean that her mother had abandoned her intentionally.  
这样下去让她心烦意乱。她甚至不确定自己在二号机里看到了什么，为什么会如此影响她？她又该如何验证呢？她不能问她的 Eva，它只是一件武器，怎么可能回答她？她真的想知道吗？或许需要时间，但她知道如果她愿意，她可以像往常一样，把它深深埋藏起来，再也不去想它。那样她就能恢复正常的自己。她不会向自己承认，但她害怕。害怕在二号机里看到的是真相。因为如果是真的，那就意味着她的母亲是有意抛弃她的。
.

Misato cursed herself for the what must have been the thousandth time since they arrived at the concert hall. She uncrossed her legs and crossed them again. It was a rookie mistake, really, and she should have known better. Really. She should have known not to accept to go to a concert without knowing what said concert was. She had expected some pop music like what Shinji was always listening to on his SDAT. She would have enjoyed that, she liked the singer's voice in the last tracks. She even had dared to to hope for some hard rock or something. Anything that could clear her head.  
自从他们到达音乐厅以来，Misato 肯定已经咒骂了自己上千次。她不自觉地交换了双腿的交叉姿势。这真是个新手错误，她本该更明白的。真的，她早该知道不该在不清楚是什么音乐会的情况下就答应去。她原本期待的是像 Shinji 经常在 SDAT 上听的那种流行音乐。她本可以享受那种音乐，她喜欢最近几首歌中歌手的声音。她甚至曾大胆地希望会有一些硬摇滚之类的。任何能让她头脑清醒的东西。

It's not that she disliked classical music or anything, it's just that she found it so boring !  
并不是说她讨厌古典音乐什么的，只是她觉得它太无聊了！

She was trying, really trying, with all her might, not to show how bored she was, but she knew she was not doing a very good job at the moment. She just couldn't stop fidgeting on her seat. She had to make an effort. A few sighs had already escaped her lips. She rolled her eyes, slouching a little more on her seat and tried her best to stifle a yawn. And she knew the most boring part had not even started yet. This was going to be long. She really didn't want to ruin the concert for her charges. She could see how much they were enjoying themselves. 'Ugh ! How long is the concerto again ?'  
她正竭尽全力，真的在努力，不让自己的无聊表现出来，但她知道自己现在做得并不好。她就是无法停止在座位上动来动去。她必须努力克制。已经有几声叹息从她唇间溜出。她翻了翻白眼，在座位上稍微蜷缩了一些，并尽力抑制住一个哈欠。而且她知道最无聊的部分还没开始呢。这将是一场漫长的等待。她真的不想破坏孩子们的音乐会体验。她能看到他们有多享受。'呃！这个协奏曲到底有多长？'

Shinji was absolutely fascinated. He had already listened to Beethoven's 9th Symphony a few times but seeing it performed live was a completely different experience ! He had never been to a classical music concert in his young life. To be fair, he had never been to a concert at all. His teacher never saw the point in taking him to one.  
真嗣完全被迷住了。他已经听过贝多芬的第九交响曲几次了，但亲眼看到现场演奏是完全不同的体验！他年轻的人生中从未去过古典音乐会。公平地说，他从未去过任何音乐会。他的老师从未觉得带他去有什么意义。

Seeing the conductor gesture to one section of the orchestra to an other, moving seemingly at random, yet maintaining the harmony of all the musicians in front of his was astounding to him. All the members of the orchestra played and stopped at exactly the right time, giving life to the music sheets before them, each of them adding their contributions at the perfect moment. He couldn't isolate all of the myriad details of this composition, of course, however, it didn't prevent him from thoroughly enjoying the experience.  
看到指挥家向乐队的某一部分示意转向另一部分，动作看似随意，却始终保持着所有乐手面前的和谐，这让他感到惊叹。乐队的每个成员都在恰到好处的时候演奏和停止，赋予面前的乐谱以生命，每个人都在完美的时刻贡献自己的力量。当然，他无法完全分辨出这首作品的无数细节，但这并不妨碍他充分享受这一体验。

At one point during the third movement, he managed to pry his eyes off the violinists' hypnotizing bows and the cellists which captivated him with their dexterity to stare at his girlfriend's face. She had her eyes closed and a serene expression on her face, as if she were completely absorbed by the music. At this precise moment, after studying her face for a few seconds, Shinji Ikari had a very strange epiphany, one that should have sent shivers down his spine. However, it felt so natural at the moment that it didn't perturb him whatsoever.  
在第三乐章的某个时刻，他设法将目光从令人着迷的小提琴手弓弦和以灵巧吸引他的大提琴手身上移开，凝视着女友的脸庞。她闭着眼睛，脸上带着宁静的表情，仿佛完全沉浸在音乐之中。就在这一刻，在仔细观察了她的脸几秒钟后，碇真嗣突然有了一种非常奇怪的顿悟，这种顿悟本应让他脊背发凉。然而，那一刻它感觉如此自然，以至于丝毫没有打扰到他。

He wanted to thank his father. Because of his father, he became an Eva Pilot. Because of his father, his life was more hectic than it ever had been before. But he wouldn't change that for the world ! He had friends, he had Misato, his mother/big sister figure, and most importantly, he had her. All the pain, all the sorrow was well worth it as long as he had her in his life. He squeezed her hand gently, making her smile softly before he turned his gaze back to the cellists.  
他想感谢他的父亲。正因为父亲，他成为了一名 EVA 驾驶员。正因为父亲，他的生活比以往任何时候都要忙碌。但他绝不会为此改变世界！他有朋友，有美里，有母亲/大姐般的存在，最重要的是，他还有她。只要生命中有她，所有的痛苦和悲伤都值得。他轻轻握紧她的手，让她温柔地微笑，随后将目光转回大提琴手们。

She had very fond yet conflicting memories of this symphony. The first time she had listened to it was when her mother made her listen to an old CD from 1989. She only had vague recollections of it, obviously. Listening to it afterwards always made her feel wistful because of that. This time was no exception, nevertheless, it was also different.  
她对这首交响曲有着既深刻又矛盾的记忆。第一次听它是在母亲让她听一张 1989 年的旧 CD 时。她当然只有模糊的记忆。之后每次听都让她感到怀旧，这次也不例外，然而，它也有些不同。

She had always thought that the third movement was boring, the second movement had always been her favorite. However, this time, the third filled her with a sense of calm, of serenity... Of determination. She had never truly understood it before, but now it made her feel at peace. Just like when she was in Shinji's arms at night, when he would chase her nightmares away. He had his fingers intertwined with hers, which emphasized those feelings. He never released his hold on her hand. Their palms were a little sweaty but she couldn't care less. This time, for the first time, thanks to him, the Ode to Joy spoke to her. For the first time, these lyrics managed to make their way into her heart.. It was what she had needed. She had beaten around the bush for far too long already. She had to see for herself what was inside Unit 02. After that, when she would know, she would be able to start talking to Shinji, she would be able to get better.  
她一直认为第三乐章乏味无趣，第二乐章才是她的最爱。然而这次，第三乐章却让她感到一种宁静、平和……以及决心。她从未真正理解过它，但现在它让她感到心安。就像夜晚在真嗣的怀抱中，他驱散她的噩梦时那样。他的手指与她的紧紧相扣，更加深了这种感觉。他从未松开过她的手。他们的手掌微微出汗，但她毫不在意。这一次，多亏了他，《欢乐颂》终于对她说话了。这些歌词首次触动了她的心弦……这正是她所需要的。她已经兜了太久的圈子。她必须亲自探明零二机内部究竟藏着什么。之后，当她知晓一切，她就能开始与真嗣交谈，她就能变得更好。

Pen Pen had been looking at what was happening in front of him for quite some time, trying to make sense of it. His three roommates, even though he considered them more as his guests, were sitting at the table, eating. Well, not exclusively. Misato was drinking a beer on her seat, her back to the kitchen, which was not extraordinary in its own right, what stood out to the penguin was that she was drinking it really, really slowly, taking little sip after little sip, not downing it in seconds as she usually did. The most surprising thing was that she just kept the can to her lips, yet she was not drinking ! And it was her first beer of the evening ! Shinji was eating quietly, he looked almost normal compared to his roommates. Almost, because occasionally, he would glance to his right to look at Asuka with what could only be interpreted as worry. A few times, he looked like he was about to say or do something, then decided against it and continued eating. Asuka was eating, her chopsticks clanking noisily each time she brought them to her plate. Other than that, she was silent. Completely silent, as if lost in her own thoughts. She was usually so noisy, it was really strange.  
企鹅潘潘已经盯着眼前的一幕看了好一阵子，试图理解这一切。他的三位室友，尽管他更愿意将他们视为访客，正坐在桌前用餐。嗯，也不完全是。美里背对着厨房，坐在自己的位置上喝着啤酒，这本身并不稀奇，但让潘潘感到奇怪的是，她喝得异常缓慢，一小口接一小口，完全没有平时那种几秒内一饮而尽的豪爽。最令人惊讶的是，她只是将罐子举在唇边，却并未真正饮用！而且这还是她当晚的第一罐啤酒！真嗣安静地吃着饭，与他的室友们相比，他看起来几乎正常。几乎，因为时不时地，他会向右瞥一眼，目光中流露出明显的担忧，投向明日香。有好几次，他似乎想要说些什么或做些什么，但最终还是决定作罢，继续用餐。明日香则用筷子夹菜，每次触碰盘子时都发出清脆的声响。除此之外，她完全沉默，仿佛沉浸在自己的思绪中。她平时总是那么吵闹，此刻的安静显得格外反常。

He didn't understand those humans sometimes. A month ago everything seemed to be perfectly fine, then Asuka disappeared for a month, and now that she was back none of them seemed happy anymore. He shrugged before waddling back to his fridge. Maybe nobody, even her, wanted her back. That was the only logical explanation.  
他有时真搞不懂这些人类。一个月前一切似乎都还完美无缺，然后明日香消失了整整一个月，现在她回来了，他们却似乎都不再快乐了。他耸了耸肩，摇摇摆摆地回到冰箱前。也许没有人，包括她自己，希望她回来。这是唯一合乎逻辑的解释。

Since her talk with Shinji last month, Misato had decided to make an effort to spend more time with her charges. It had taken her some time to figure it out, but she needed to be a better guardian for them. 'I guess there's a lot going on right now... I just wish we could have a nice dinner like we used to.'  
自从上个月与真嗣谈过之后，美里决定努力多花时间陪伴她的孩子们。她花了一些时间才明白过来，但她需要成为一个更好的监护人。'我想现在有很多事情正在发生...我只希望我们能像以前那样享受一顿美好的晚餐。'

"I'm finished." Asuka stated while getting up. She took her plate and brought it to the sink. She then left in silence as the telephone started to ring. She didn't even pay it any attention as she walked to her room.  
“我吃完了。”明日香说着站起身来。她拿起盘子，把它放到水槽里。然后她默默地离开了，电话铃声随之响起。她连看都没看一眼，径直走向自己的房间。

Seeing that no one was going to pick it up, Shinji stood and went for it. Asuka stopped, then resumed her previous action once again.  
看到没人打算去捡，真嗣站起身来走向它。明日香停了下来，然后再次恢复了之前的动作。

"Yes, hello ?" Asuka had almost reached her room, her shelter when she was interrupted for a second time. "Asuka ? An international call from Germany for you. It's your mother." Shinji called out to her before she managed to leave. He offered her the phone with a shy smile.  
“是的，你好？”明日香几乎已经到了她的房间，那是她被打断时的避难所。“明日香？从德国打来的国际电话，是你妈妈。”真嗣在她离开前喊住了她。他带着羞涩的微笑将电话递给她。

"For me ? From Mama ?" She said shyly, yet with little inflexion, as she grabbed the phone. Shinji kept looking at her while she started speaking German in front of him. He saw her blush a little while answering her interlocutor.  
“给我的？从妈妈那里？”她羞涩地说道，语气中却几乎没有起伏，接过了电话。真嗣一直看着她，她开始在他面前用德语交谈。他看到她在回答对方时脸颊微微泛红。

Deciding not to intrude into her privacy, even though he couldn't understand a single word that she was saying at the moment, he decided to go wash the dishes. He couldn't help but listen to her, however. It fascinated him to hear her speak another language. The feeling was peculiar, she was still the same person, her voice was still the same, but he had never heard her speak German for a long time like this. He had almost forgotten that she wasn't Japanese. She sounded so exotic ! When he was done with the dishes, he went to the living room and lounged on the couch, still idly listening to his girlfriend voice.  
决定不打扰她的私人空间，尽管此刻他一个字也听不懂她在说什么，他还是决定去洗碗。然而，他忍不住倾听她的声音。听到她说另一种语言让他着迷。这种感觉很奇特，她依然是同一个人，声音也依旧，但他很久没有听过她这样长时间地说德语了。他几乎忘了她不是日本人。她的发音听起来如此异国情调！洗完碗后，他走进客厅，懒洋洋地躺在沙发上，依旧漫不经心地听着女友的声音。

"Mother..." He thought wistfully. She had never told him anything about her mother. The only time he had mentioned her mother, Asuka had stampeded to her room, her eyes full of tears. 'Why does her mother not call her more often ? And why does Asuka never call her ?' He didn't realize it, but he had started to flex and relax his hand. He was getting angry. He couldn't understand why Asuka would just not call her mother if she had the opportunity. Her mother was alive ! His train of thought was cut short when he heard that Asuka had ended the call. He stood up and turned to her. "You sure talked for a long time." He said, trying to remain as calm as possible. He knew he was glaring at her, he just couldn't help it, his hand was still flexing and relaxing.  
"妈妈..." 他遐想着。她从未向他透露过任何关于她母亲的事情。唯一一次提到她母亲时，明日香便泪眼汪汪地冲回了自己的房间。'为什么她妈妈不常给她打电话？而明日香又为何从不主动联系她？' 他没有意识到，自己的手已经开始不自觉地握紧又松开。他感到愤怒。他不明白，既然有机会，明日香为何不主动联系她的母亲。她的母亲还健在啊！他的思绪被明日香挂断电话的声音打断。他站起身，转向她。"你聊得挺久的。" 他尽量保持平静地说道。他知道自己正瞪着她，他就是控制不住，手还在不停地握紧又松开。

"Well, it's our usual bit of communication." Asuka answered with a hint of disappointment in her tone.  
"嗯，这是我们惯常的交流方式。" 明日香回答，语气中带着一丝失望。

"It must be nice to have a family to talk to." Shinji replied as sarcastically as he could. He felt bitter. It wasn't completely Asuka's fault. Maybe she had not told him about her family not to hurt his feelings. It was unintentional, but he felt almost betrayed by her.  
"有家人可以聊天一定很美好吧。" 真嗣尽可能地用讽刺的口吻回应。他感到苦涩。这并不完全是明日香的错。也许她没告诉他关于家人的事，是不想伤害他的感情。虽然是无意的，但他几乎感到被她背叛了。

She didn't seem to pick up on the caustic comment. "Well, just in appearance. It's only on the surface. She's not my real mother anyway." Shinji's anger disappeared instantly as she said that. "My father moved on with his life rather quickly..." Shinji had walked around the couch and was now facing her. He grabbed her hand with his own. "But it's not like I hate her or anything. I just don't deal with her well. We still talk from time to time because she's my step-mother... Otherwise she would probably have given up like everyone else..." She then added with a smile "You know more than most how I can be !"  
"她似乎并未察觉那句尖刻的评论。“嗯，只是外表上。仅此而已。她毕竟不是我的亲生母亲。” 说到这里，真嗣的怒气瞬间消散了。“我父亲很快就重新开始了他的生活……” 真嗣绕过沙发，现在正面对着她。他用自己的手握住了她的手。“但我并不恨她或什么的。我只是不太擅长与她相处。我们偶尔还是会交谈，因为她是我继母……否则她可能也像其他人一样放弃了……” 她随后微笑着补充道，“你比大多数人更了解我！””

They chuckled a little together, still holding hands. "People never gave you the chance you deserve."  
"他们一起轻声笑了笑，依然牵着手。“人们从未给你应得的机会。””

She smiled. That same smile that made his knees weak. A smile that he had not seen for more than a month. "Thank you, idiot." She let go of his hand and finally managed to get to her room.  
"她笑了。那个让他膝盖发软的笑容。一个他一个多月未曾见过的笑容。“谢谢你，傻瓜。” 她松开了他的手，终于设法回到了自己的房间。”

Shinji stood there, watching the door behind which she disappeared. "You're very nice to her." Misato stated, breaking him out of his musing.  
真嗣站在那里，注视着她消失的那扇门。“你对她的确很好。”美里说道，打断了他的沉思。

"She doesn't show it, but there's something wrong. We have to be there for her." He said with authority, turning to face her.  
“她虽然不表现出来，但肯定有什么不对劲。我们必须在她身边支持她。”他带着权威的口吻说道，转过身面对她。

"You two are really good to each other. You're more confident in yourself. You have not stuttered once while talking to her ! I'm happy for you." She added with melancholy. "I'm very proud of you two." Having said that, she went to the bathroom.  
“你们俩真的很关心对方。你比以前自信多了。和她说话时，你一次都没有结巴过！我为你感到高兴。”她带着一丝忧郁补充道，“我为你们俩感到非常骄傲。”说完这些，她走向了洗手间。

Shinji could hear the bathtub filling up, and since Asuka probably needed to be alone, he decided to go to his old room to occupy himself with some homework.  
真嗣能听到浴缸正在放水，既然明日香可能需要独处，他决定去自己的旧房间做些作业来打发时间。

.

.

The water was draining slowly from the bathtub. There probably were hair again clogging the drain. Asuka was standing in front of the bathtub, naked, the stopper in her left hand, looking idly at the water level going down. "What's happening to me ?" She asked herself quietly. "This is disgusting !.. I should feel sick just thinking about bathing in the same water as Misato and stupid Shinji !"  
浴缸里的水正缓慢地排走。大概又是头发堵住了下水口。明日香站在浴缸前，一丝不挂，左手拿着塞子，漫不经心地看着水位下降。“我这是怎么了？”她轻声自问，“这太恶心了！……光是想到和美里还有笨蛋真嗣用同一缸水洗澡，我就应该感到恶心！”

When the tub was only two thirds full, she put the stopper back in its place. "Yet somehow... It almost feels... Comforting." She said as she turned the hot water on. Bathing in the same water meant that it was usually too cold when the last person got to take their bath. "I don't get it !" She was getting more upset as she continued with her introspection. "I've lived only for myself for so long... It feels so... Alien. And now I don't think I could ever go back to it..." She trailed off, still watching with disinterest as the bathtub was getting full again. "Stupid Shinji ! This is all your fault !" Despite her accusation, she couldn't help but smile softly.  
当浴缸只装满三分之二时，她将塞子重新塞好。“然而不知为何...这几乎让人...感到安慰。”她一边说着，一边打开了热水。共用同一缸水意味着通常最后一个人洗澡时水已经太凉了。“我不明白！”随着自我反省的深入，她越发感到烦躁。“我为自己而活了这么久...这感觉如此...陌生。而现在，我觉得我再也无法回到那种状态了...”她话音渐弱，依旧漠然地看着浴缸再次被注满。“笨蛋真嗣！这都是你的错！”尽管如此指责，她还是忍不住轻轻笑了。

Her smile vanished quickly, however, as a cramp forced her to hold her stomach. She groaned in pain and grit her teeth. "Ugh ! I hate this !" She cried out to externalize her pain. "I don't even want children !" She took a deep breath after closing her eyes. "Right ?.." She frowned at herself while turning off the tap, her right hand still nursing her stomach. "I'm not sure anymore..." She paused. "Things really were easier when Shinji was just an idiot who cooked my food... But he... Loves me... Maybe I'm the idiot." She chuckled humorlessly before getting into the bathtub.  
然而，她的笑容很快消失了，因为一阵痉挛迫使她捂住了肚子。她痛苦地呻吟着，咬紧牙关。“呃！我讨厌这样！”她向外宣泄着疼痛。“我甚至不想要孩子！”她闭上眼睛深吸了一口气。“对吧？..”她皱着眉头对自己说，同时关掉了水龙头，右手仍轻抚着肚子。“我现在不确定了...”她停顿了一下。“事情真的在真嗣只是个做饭的傻瓜时更简单...但他...爱我...也许我才是傻瓜。”她苦笑了一下，然后走进了浴缸。

.

.

It was getting quite late when she got out of the bathroom, clad in her pajamas. Shinji was probably already asleep in their bed. She stayed in her bath longer than usual, the warm water doing wonders to her aching stomach. She slid the bathroom door shut quietly before navigating the apartment.  
当她穿着睡衣走出浴室时，时间已经很晚了。真嗣可能已经在床上睡着了。她在浴缸里待的时间比平时长，温暖的水对她的疼痛的肚子有奇效。她轻轻地关上浴室的门，然后在公寓里走动。

"Asuka ? Are you okay ?" She tried to conceal how startled she had been at hearing Misato's voice.  
“明日香？你还好吗？”她试图掩饰听到美里声音时的惊慌。

"I'm fine !" She answered vehemently as she tried to calm her heart rate. Her abdominal pain didn't help with her patience either.  
"我没事！" 她激烈地回答，试图平复心跳。腹部的疼痛也让她更加不耐烦。

"You know, you shouldn't preoccupy yourself with those things..." Misato continued quietly, not reacting to Asuka's anger.  
"你知道，你不应该为那些事情分心..." 美里继续平静地说，没有对明日香的情绪做出反应。

"Are you kidding me ?" That did it. "You were listening to me ? What the hell Misato ?" She screamed, not caring if Shinji was asleep anymore. Nor the neighbors, for that matter. This intrusion on her privacy was too much at the moment.  
"你在开玩笑吗？" 这让她彻底爆发了。"你一直在听我说话？搞什么鬼，美里？" 她尖叫着，不再在乎真嗣是否还在睡觉，也不在乎邻居们会怎么想。此刻，这种侵犯隐私的行为让她无法忍受。

"I didn't mean to... I just heard you through the door." She whispered, trying to make her charge understand that shouting this late was not something that should be done.  
"我不是故意的...我只是隔着门听到了你的声音。" 她低声说道，试图让她的委托人明白，这么晚大声喊叫是不应该的。

"I can't believe it ! I'm never truly by myself anymore, except when I'm in the bathroom ! And even there I have to be aware that you could be eavesdropping ?!"  
"我简直不敢相信！我现在连一个人独处的时候都没有了，除了在浴室里！甚至在浴室里我还得提防你可能在偷听？！"

"Asuka... Calm down, you'll wake Shinji. I really didn't mean to. And I promise it won't happen again. I just couldn't ignore what you said." She saw Asuka take a deep breath, maybe talking about Shinji was a good idea to calm her.  
"明日香...冷静点，你会吵醒真嗣的。我真的不是故意的。我保证不会再发生这种事了。我只是无法忽视你说的那些话。" 她看到明日香深吸了一口气，也许提到真嗣是个让她冷静下来的好主意。

"What is it ?" She spat. She wasn't screaming anymore, but she was still extremely angry. "You're going to lecture me now that you intruded into my privacy ?"  
“什么事？”她厉声问道。她不再尖叫，但依然怒气冲冲。“你现在要教训我，就因为你侵犯了我的隐私？”

Misato tried her best to ignore the sarcasm, it still hurt though. "... You grew up too fast, Asuka." She said, sitting down on her chair at the kitchen table. "Lots of things happened to you... Things you didn't deserve..." She was taking her time to carefully pick her words, the situation was tense enough as it was. Asuka sat down, opting to stay silent for the moment. "You have a lot of responsibilities on you shoulders, so you shouldn't bother yourself with this right now... You have to appreciate what you have." She lowered her head and took a deep breath before looking her charge in the eye again. "Don't squander your chance to be happy." She sounded thoroughly sad, probably thinking about Kaji, Asuka mused. "You and Shinji have a good influence on each other. Focus on this. You can think about all these things later."

She stopped and waited for a reaction from Asuka, who kept silent. She was looking right back at her intently, with animosity, but also with something else. She was really taking into consideration the advice her rude guardian just gave her.  
她停下脚步，等待着明日香的反应，但明日香保持沉默。她正专注地回望着她，带着敌意，但也夹杂着其他情感。她确实在认真考虑这位粗鲁的监护人刚刚给她的建议。

Seeing that she wasn't answering, Misato continued. "I'm sorry I listened to what you said. But I want you to know that if you ever need to talk or anything, I'm here." She smiled warmly, tilting her head to the right a little. "I've been neglecting you since you arrived in Japan. That's an other thing I've messed up !" She tried to sound playful, but it was obvious that she took it seriously. "I want to make it up to you. We're a team ! And I'm supposed to be your guardian, it's about time I start acting like that !"  
见她没有回答，美里继续说道。“对不起，我听了你说的话。但我想让你知道，如果你需要倾诉或任何帮助，我都在这里。”她温暖地微笑着，微微向右偏了偏头。“自从你来到日本，我就一直忽视你。这是我搞砸的另一件事！”她试图用轻松的语气说话，但显然她很认真。“我想弥补这一点。我们是一个团队！而我应该是你的监护人，是时候我开始履行这个角色了！”

Asuka's anger had receded quickly once Misato had started her monologue. Receded, not vanished. She had not expected this. She just wanted to go to bed, she was too tired to argue. She could hold some grudges though. "... Thank you..." She didn't know what else to say. She was still angry, of course, but it was nice to know that Misato was there for her as well. She would probably never ask her anything, but it was nice nonetheless. She had wanted Misato to act more like a guardian, even if she would have never admitted it. That was something she absolutely did not want to admit, but she was starting to get tired of handling everything by herself.  
随着美里开始她的独白，明日香心中的怒火迅速消退了。消退，而非消失。她未曾预料到这一幕。她只想上床睡觉，太累了，无力争吵。但她仍能怀恨在心。"...谢谢你..."她不知还能说些什么。当然，她依旧愤怒，但得知美里也在她身边，这感觉很好。她或许永远不会向她求助，但这份安心依旧美好。她曾希望美里能更像一个监护人，即便她从未承认过。这是她绝对不愿承认的事，但她开始厌倦独自应对一切。

She left without saying an other word. She wanted to go to bed, to find comfort in Shinji's arms. They had a sync test the next day, and there was something she had to do.  
她一言不发地离开了。她想上床，在真嗣的怀抱中寻求安慰。第二天他们有同步测试，有些事情她必须去做。

### Chapter 14 : Town with no cheer
Hey !

Here's the author's cut of chapter 14 ! I've added some scenes from other fics that I didn't ass in the ff version. It's been a rather hard chapter to write, so I hope you like it !  
这是作者修订版的第 14 章！我添加了一些来自其他同人文的场景，这些在原版中没有加入。这一章写起来相当艰难，希望你们会喜欢！

"Ugh !" She had tried to be angry when she got out of her entry-plug but all she could manage was annoyance and frustration. She was tired. To be more precise, she was completely exhausted.  
“呃！”她试图在离开插入栓时表现出愤怒，但最终只能感到恼怒和沮丧。她很疲惫。更准确地说，她已经筋疲力尽了。

She knew that she wanted to know, that she wanted to reach out to whatever was hiding inside her Unit 02, so she focused all her efforts towards that goal during this sync test... To no avail. Sync tests were usually nothing much to her. She had to get inside the entry-plug, concentrate a little if she felt like it and leave. And she had the highest sync rate, usually. This time she had to really concentrate in order to find what she was looking for. If there was something to look for in the first place. She could feel something, like a distant presence lurking, watching her from afar. She didn't know what it was or how to reach it, but she spent all this time trying to get closer to it. But the more she tried, the farther it seemed to get.  
她知道自己想要了解，想要触及隐藏在她二号机内的某种存在，因此在这场同步测试中，她全力以赴地朝这个目标努力……却徒劳无功。同步测试对她来说通常不算什么。她只需进入插入栓，如果愿意的话集中一下注意力，然后离开。而且她通常拥有最高的同步率。这次她必须真正集中精力去寻找她所追寻的东西。如果那里真的有什么东西的话。她能感觉到某种遥远的存在，像是一个潜伏者，从远处窥视着她。她不知道那是什么，也不知道如何触及它，但她花了所有时间试图接近它。然而，她越是努力，它似乎就离得越远。

She could sense it. So she didn't give up, and even though she had failed, she would try again on the next occasion she would get. She was Asuka Langley Soryu. She didn't give up. But she was demoralized. Not only did she fail in getting to the bottom of what was in Unit 02, she also got her worst sync rate since arriving in Japan.  
她能感觉到。所以她没有放弃，尽管失败了，她仍会在下一次机会来临时再次尝试。她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。她不会放弃。但她感到沮丧。不仅没能揭开二号机内部的秘密，她的同步率还降到了来日本后的最低点。

She sighed again loudly, waiting for the elevator. "What a colossal waste of time !" She exclaimed in the empty hallway. All she wanted was to get out of this accursed place and go back home, where things were not as bad.  
她再次大声叹息，等待着电梯。“真是浪费时间！”她在空荡荡的走廊里喊道。她只想离开这个该死的地方，回到家里，那里没有这么糟糕。

Punching that wall was starting to feel like a very good idea... Idea that she quickly dismissed however. Shinji would notice. He would see even the tiniest bruise on her knuckles and he would ask questions she didn't feel like answering. His puppy eyes were already breaking her heart enough, she didn't need to give him more reasons to be sad and worry about her.  
捶打那面墙的想法开始变得诱人……但她很快打消了这个念头。真嗣会注意到。他甚至会看到她拳头上最微小的瘀伤，然后问一些她不想回答的问题。他的小狗眼已经让她心碎，她不需要再给他更多理由来为她难过和担心。

She was barely able to suppress a jolt when the elevator doors opened and revealed Rei Ayanami. She covered it by rolling her eyes in an exaggerated fashion before stepping inside, leaning on the wall to her right, her arms crossed.  
当电梯门打开，露出绫波零的身影时，她几乎无法抑制内心的震动。她用夸张地翻白眼来掩饰，随后走进电梯，靠在右边的墙上，双臂交叉。

Rei... Yet an other thing on her to-do list. 'Just... Shut up, Wondergirl. Stay quiet. I'm not in the mood !' She thought angrily. However, Shinji's words kept repeating themselves in her head. And for once she had the opportunity to do something. She was being selfish, again. 'I know it's unfair, but I already have enough to deal with.'  
绫波...又是她待办事项上的一件事。'只是...闭嘴，奇迹少女。保持安静。我没心情！'她愤怒地想。然而，真嗣的话不断在她脑海中回响。这一次，她有机会做些什么。她又在自私了。'我知道这不公平，但我已经有太多要处理的事情了。'

"The Eva won't move unless you open your heart." As if on cue, Rei talked in her usual emotionless tone.  
“除非你敞开心扉，否则 Eva 不会动。”仿佛是应景一般，绫波用她一贯毫无感情的语调说道。

Asuka sighed again. "If it's so easy, how come you're so far behind me and Stupid Shinji ?" She answered as angrily as she could. She just sounded tired, not at all like she usually sounded when she got angry.  
明日香又叹了口气。“既然这么简单，你怎么会落后我和笨蛋真嗣这么多？”她尽可能生气地回答。但她听起来只是疲惫，完全没有平时生气时的样子。

"Because I cannot." A hint of annoyance could be heard in her inflexion. She had tensed very slightly upon hearing "Stupid Shinji".  
“因为我做不到。”她的语气中透露出一丝不悦。听到“笨蛋真嗣”这个词时，她微微紧张了一下。

"Why do you always have to be so cryptic ?!" She was raising her voice. "Forget that. Why are you talking to me all of a sudden ?" She couldn't begin to comprehend why Rei would chose this day of all days to talk to her.  
“为什么你总是这么神秘兮兮的？！”她的声音提高了。“算了。为什么你突然要跟我说话？”她无法理解为什么绫波会选择在今天这个日子跟她说话。

"I do not trust the Pilot who is to replace you."  
"我不信任那个将要接替你的驾驶员。"

This statement hurt. Bad. The last thing she wanted was to be replaced. She had trained to be the best most of her life. They couldn't replace her like that. It was unfair. She didn't show it however"... Yeah. Right. Because everyone knows you trust me with your life !" She still hadn't accepted that Rei had declined her friendship, as a consequence, her statement sounded false. Asuka was in a whirlwind of emotions, all of them negative, just because of one sentence. She wanted this conversation to end. She was exhausted, all she wanted was to go home and sulk in peace.  
这话刺痛了她，非常痛。她最不希望的就是被替换。她一生中大部分时间都在训练成为最好的。他们不能就这样替换她，这不公平。然而她没有表现出来……是的，没错。因为大家都知道你把生命托付给了我！" 她仍然没有接受丽拒绝她的友谊，因此，她的话听起来很虚伪。明日香正处于情绪的漩涡中，全都是负面的，只因为一句话。她希望这场对话结束。她筋疲力尽，只想回家安静地生闷气。

"You are a valuable Pilot. The three of us have already defeated several Angels together. Moreover, Pilot Ikari trusts you, that is enough for me." All these were facts. Just plain statements, nothing more, nothing less, yet it made Asuka feel a little better. 'I really must have lost my edge.' She thought bitterly.  
"你是一位宝贵的驾驶员。我们三人已经一起击败了几个使徒。而且，碇驾驶员信任你，这对我来说已经足够了。" 这些都是事实，只是简单的陈述，不多也不少，但这让明日香感觉好了一点。'我一定是失去了我的锋芒。' 她苦涩地想。

Ding.

Asuka was taken aback by this answer. It was the first time Rei had told her something which could be interpreted as a compliment. Or something even remotely positive, for that matter. "... Erm... Thanks ? I guess ?.." She answered as she got out of the elevator. Rei followed suit, which puzzled her, since she was standing just in front of the doors. "What ?" Asuka snarled without turning.  
明日香对这个回答感到意外。这是丽第一次告诉她可以被解读为赞美的话。或者说，任何稍微积极一点的事情。"...呃...谢谢？我想？.." 她一边回答一边走出电梯。丽紧随其后，这让明日香感到困惑，因为她就站在电梯门口。"什么？" 明日香没转身就咆哮道。

"I wish to discuss further things with you." Rei said as calmly as possible, but she was unnerved.  
"我想和你进一步讨论一些事情。" 丽尽可能平静地说，但她感到不安。

Asuka really couldn't be sure but she would have sworn she heard worry in Rei's voice nonetheless. "My, my... You're a real chatterbox ! Who would have thought ?" She answered sardonically.  
明日香真的不确定，但她发誓她在丽的声音中听到了担忧。"哎呀，哎呀...你真是个话痨！谁会想到呢？" 她讽刺地回答。

"Can I accompany you ?" Rei asked, all emotions gone from her once again.  
“我可以陪你吗？”丽问道，所有的情感再次从她身上消失。

"Don't you think it's already been enough for one day ?" She asked as clearly as possible 'If she can't understand sarcasm, I'll make it clear for her.' She was at her limit now. She avoided speaking with Rei even when she was having a good day, she didn't need to chat with her right now.  
“你不觉得今天已经够了吗？”她尽可能清晰地问道，‘如果她听不懂讽刺，我会说得再明白些。’她现在已经到了极限。即使在她心情好的时候，她也尽量避免和丽说话，现在更不需要和她聊天。

"Please, Pilot Soryu, this is important." Rei didn't react when Asuka tried and mostly failed to stifle a gasp. She knew this must have sounded desperate coming for her, but she had to tell her what was happening.  
“请吧，丽驾驶员，这很重要。”当明日香试图并多半失败地抑制住一声惊呼时，丽没有反应。她知道这听起来一定很绝望，但从她嘴里说出来，但她必须告诉她正在发生的事情。

"Ugh ! Fine ! Whatever !" Asuka answered, defeated, and intrigued, she couldn't deny it. She knew Rei would not give up easily, the best thing to do was to hear her out and maybe eventually she would be done with this day.  
"呃！好吧！随便！" 明日香无奈又好奇地回答，她无法否认这一点。她知道丽不会轻易放弃，最好的办法是听她说完，也许这样今天就能结束了。

They both walked in silence in the corridors leading out of the Geofront for a few minutes. Asuka was getting pretty annoyed at her fellow Pilot's silence. 'If she wanted to talk, why isn't she talking right now !?'  
她们在通往地表的走廊里沉默地走了几分钟。明日香对这位同僚驾驶员的沉默感到相当恼火。'如果她想说话，为什么现在不说话！？'

"There are surveillance systems everywhere in the Geofront. I don't want this conversation to be overheard." Asuka heard Rei say. It startled her a little, it was as if she was reading her mind. She rationalized it quickly though. It probably wasn't that hard to guess.  
"地底都市到处都是监控系统。我不想这次对话被偷听到。" 明日香听到丽说。这让她有点吃惊，仿佛她在读心。但她很快理性地想了想，这大概也不难猜到。

"We're out now." "我们现在出来了。"

"Commander Ikari suspects that you and Pilot Ikari are romantically involved."  
"碇司令怀疑你和真嗣驾驶员有恋爱关系。"

"Wha..? We... That's none of his business !" Asuka stopped dead in her tracks and turned to face her fellow pilot. Terror etched on her face. It quickly turned to rage and hatred. "And none of yours either !" She screamed, her face red from embarrassment and anger.  
"什...？我们...那不关他的事！" 明日香突然停下脚步，转身面对她的同伴驾驶员。恐惧刻在她的脸上。很快，恐惧变成了愤怒和憎恨。"也与你无关！" 她尖叫道，脸因尴尬和愤怒而涨得通红。

Rei stayed silent for a few seconds, studying the redhead's face. "Indeed. It is not. The Commander is not sure yet, however, he is actively seeking confirmation. He has asked me to report to him if I were to learn that you were in a relationship."  
丽沉默了几秒，仔细观察着红发女孩的脸。“确实，并非如此。指挥官尚未确定，但他正在积极寻求确认。他让我一旦得知你们的关系，就向他汇报。”

"So you asked me just so you could go back to this asshole and tell him everything like the good little doll you are ?" Asuka was -very- glad to be this angry, otherwise she would have blushed so much at the word relationship that even Rei would have gotten the message.  
“所以你问我只是为了回去向那个混蛋报告一切，就像个听话的小玩偶一样？”明日香非常庆幸自己能如此愤怒，否则她会因为“关系”这个词而脸红到连丽都能明白她的心思。

"I am not a doll." Rei answered calmly.  
“我不是玩偶。”丽平静地回答。

"You are a doll ! You're going to run to your beloved Commander and tell him everything that just happened ! I ha..."  
"你真是个玩偶！你要跑去你亲爱的指挥官那里，告诉他刚刚发生的一切！我……"

Rei sternly cut her, without even raising her voice. "I am not a doll." She repeated for emphasis. "And I am not going to tell him anything." She trailed off, still scrutinizing Asuka's face, which adorned a mix of terror, anger and incomprehension. When she didn't speak up, Rei resumed. "I just wanted you and Pilot Ikari to be aware that the Commander is watching you."  
绫波严厉地打断了她，甚至没有提高声音。“我不是玩偶。”她重复强调道。“我也不会告诉他任何事。”她继续审视着明日香的脸，那上面混合着恐惧、愤怒和不解。见她没有说话，绫波继续道：“我只是想让你和碇驾驶员知道，指挥官在监视你们。”

Asuka was about to explode when what Rei just told her, and what it implied, hit her. "I... Thank you, Wondergirl."  
明日香正要爆发，但绫波刚刚告诉她的事情及其含义击中了她。“我……谢谢你，三无少女。”

Rei didn't do anything to acknowledge Asuka's gratitude. She just turned on her heels and walked away. Before she got out of her sight, Asuka drew her attention once again. "Wondergirl ?" Rei stopped and turned around to look at her fellow pilot. "And thanks for taking care of the idiot last month. I owe you one." Rei nodded then continued walking.  
丽并没有对明日香表示感谢做出任何回应。她只是转过身，径直离开。在她走出视线之前，明日香再次吸引了她的注意。“三无少女？”丽停下脚步，转过身来看着她的同伴驾驶员。“还有，谢谢你上个月照顾那个白痴。我欠你一个人情。”丽点了点头，然后继续前行。

Later that night, Shinji and Asuka were idly lounging in their room. Shinji had put a pillow between the wall and his back to make his position more comfortable. Asuka was leaning with her back against him, snuggled in his arms.  
那天晚上晚些时候，真嗣和明日香懒洋洋地躺在他们的房间里。真嗣在墙和自己的背之间放了一个枕头，以使自己的姿势更舒适。明日香则背靠着他，依偎在他的怀里。

"... I'm sorry... You know... For punching you." She broke the silence after some minutes, her voice was low, just above a whisper.  
“……对不起……你知道的……为了打你那件事。”几分钟的沉默后，她打破了寂静，声音低沉，几乎是在耳语。

"That's okay, I understand." Shinji answered, squeezing her reassuringly.  
“没关系，我理解。” 真嗣回答道，安慰地握紧她的手。

It would have worked on most people, but not Asuka. "Don't !" her voice wasn't calm nor low anymore. "You shouldn't accept that ! I don't want you to think that this is normal, idiot ! I don't want you to accept when I hurt you." Her voice cracked a little, but she mostly kept her composure. This was important, she had to make him understand that even if she lost control sometimes, she didn't mean to, and moreover, that he had to stand up to her.  
这招对大多数人或许管用，但对明日香不行。“别这样！”她的声音不再平静也不再低沉。“你不该接受这个！我不想让你认为这是正常的，笨蛋！我不想让你在我伤害你时还接受。”她的声音有些哽咽，但大体上保持了镇定。这很重要，她必须让他明白，即使她有时失控，那并非有意，而且更重要的是，他必须对她有所坚持。

"I'm sorry." He answered meekly.  
“对不起。”他怯生生地回答。

"No ! I am sorry." She emphasized. "I hurt you. Don't be sorry ! You can't lower your head and accept when someone hurts you, not even me !" She sounded angry, but she just wanted to make sure he understood.  
“不！我很抱歉。”她强调道，“我伤害了你。不要说对不起！当有人伤害你时，你不能低头接受，即使是我也不行！”她听起来很生气，但她只是想确保他明白。

"You were sad... I can't blame you for this." Shinji reassured her once again. She had already enough bothering her. He couldn't put another burden of her shoulders. He could take it. He would take it, for her.  
“你当时很难过……我不能因此责怪你。”真嗣再次安慰她。她已经有很多烦心事了。他不能再给她增加负担。他能承受。他会承受，为了她。

There was a somewhat uncomfortable pause before she spoke again. "Why do you put up with me ?" She couldn't deny the fact that she feared his answer. She wasn't even sure why she asked the question, it just came out.  
她沉默了一会儿，气氛有些尴尬，然后她再次开口：“你为什么要忍受我？”她无法否认自己害怕他的回答。她甚至不确定为什么要问这个问题，只是脱口而出。

Shinji took some time to answer. Too much. Asuka elbowed him a little too harshly to make him answer faster. "... You are you."  
真嗣花了些时间才回答。太久了。明日香用力撞了他一下，催促他快点回答。“……你就是你自己。”

"That doesn't mean anything." She said, annoyed and rolled her eyes for good measure. He couldn't see it but she was sure he felt it !  
“那根本不算什么解释。”她不悦地说，还翻了个白眼以示强调。他虽然看不见，但她确信他能感受到她的不满！

"I know." He answered with a smile which annoyed her just a bit more. "I-it's just that... I... I lo-love you. All of you... I just wish you'd talk to me when something is bothering you." His voice got more sullen.  
“我知道。”他微笑着回答，这让她更加恼火。“我只是想说……我……我喜——喜欢你。全部的你……我只是希望你有事能跟我说。”他的声音变得低沉。

"That's not who I am. I can't just tell you everything like that." 'Like you did' She added mentally.  
"那不是我的本性。我不能就这样把一切都告诉你。" '就像你曾经那样' 她在心里补充道。

"You don't have to do this by yourself." He answered, half-pleading, half-disappointed.  
"你不必独自承担这一切。" 他回答，半是恳求，半是失望。

"I know." Her voice got mellower. "You'll always be there for me." She felt him tense suddenly as she said that, hugging her a bit too tight and too forcefully. She laughed gently. "What ? You think I'd forget ? Don't worry, I'll make sure you keep your promise !"  
"我知道。" 她的声音变得柔和。"你永远都会在我身边。" 她感觉到他说这话时突然紧张起来，抱得她有点太紧、太用力了。她轻声笑道。"怎么了？你以为我会忘记吗？别担心，我会确保你遵守承诺的！"

Shinji calmed down and caressed her arm a little as if nothing happened. "Then let me help you." He said with determination.  
真嗣平静下来，轻轻抚摸她的手臂，仿佛什么都没发生过。“那么，让我帮你吧。”他坚定地说道。

"You already help me." She turned her head so they could look at each other. "Much more than you think. I... There are things I have to deal with before I can talk to you."  
“你已经帮了我很多。”她转过头，让他们能对视。“比我意识到的还要多。我……有些事情我必须先处理好，才能和你谈。”

"Okay." He agreed, with just a hint of disappointment. "That's enough for me."  
“好吧。”他同意了，带着一丝失望。“对我来说，这就足够了。”

"Really ?" She raised an eyebrow. "I didn't think you'd be so easy to convince."  
"真的吗？" 她挑了挑眉。"我没想到你会这么容易被说服。"

"You're the Great Asuka Langley Soryu." Shinji declared as solemnly as possible. "You have one word ! Thus I know that you will tell me everything eventually !" They both chuckled softly.  
"你是伟大的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。" 真嗣尽可能严肃地宣布。"你有一句话！所以我知道你最终会告诉我一切的！" 他们俩都轻轻地笑了。"

"I... I can't argue with that." She rested her forehead against his, looking in his deep blue eyes for what seemed like the first time in ages. "Thank you, Stupid Shinji." She wriggled in his arms until she was mostly facing him, her forehead still against his. They looked in each other's eyes until, in unison, they got closer and closer.  
"我...我无法反驳这一点。" 她将额头靠在他的额头上，凝视着他深蓝色的眼睛，仿佛是久违的第一次。"谢谢你，笨蛋真嗣。" 她在他的怀里扭动，直到大部分面对着他，额头依然紧贴着。他们凝视着彼此的眼睛，直到同步地，他们越来越近。"

They closed their eyes as their lips met in a passionate kiss. An intimate moment that they had not shared for a long time. Ir crossed Shinji's mind that the last time they had shared a moment like this was before she got absorbed in her Eva. As a consequence, it got more intense quite rapidly, both teenagers getting caught in the moment. They slipped under the cover and before they knew it, Asuka was on top of Shinji, straddling him. When they broke the kiss, Shinji looked at her with loving, albeit dazed eyes, breathing heavily. Asuka opened her eyes and smiled at him, panting a little, trying to conceal her own feelings as much as she could. Her long red hair cascading messily on one side of her face, her cheeks flushed. "By the way, Wondergirl knows about us now. And your asshole of a father is onto us. What's the matter with him ?" She had to change the subject or things would have escalated too quickly. Both their hands were already under the other's shirt. Shinji's were on her back, and hers on his stomach.  
他们的唇在激情中相触，闭上了双眼。这是一个久违的亲密时刻。真嗣脑海中闪过上一次他们如此亲近的记忆，那是在她沉浸于 Eva 之前。结果，这一刻迅速升温，两个少年都陷入了情不自禁。他们滑入被窝，转眼间，明日香跨坐在真嗣身上。当他们分开双唇时，真嗣用充满爱意却略显迷离的眼神看着她，呼吸急促。明日香睁开眼，对他微笑，喘息着试图掩饰自己的情感。她长长的红发凌乱地垂在脸颊一侧，双颊绯红。“对了，绫波知道了我们的事。还有你那混蛋老爸也在盯着我们。他到底怎么了？”她不得不转移话题，否则事情会发展得太快。两人的手已经伸进了对方的衬衫下，真嗣的手在她背上，而她的手在他的腹部。

Shinji's expression became serious in an instant. "We can't get caught ! He already tried to get rid of you. He tried to replace you !" He frowned and continued through clenched teeth. "I won't let him."  
真嗣的表情瞬间变得严肃。“我们不能被抓到！他已经试图除掉你了。他试图替换你！”他皱着眉头，咬牙切齿地继续说道。“我不会让他得逞的。”

"He can't get rid of me !" She said in a light tone, beaming because of how much she enjoyed his concern for her. "As you said, he already tried ! We'll just have to be even more careful." She then planted a small kiss on his lips. "Stop worrying about it and sleep, idiot."  
“他不能把我怎么样！”她轻快地说道，因为他的关心而笑得灿烂。“就像你说的，他之前已经试过了！我们只需要更加小心。”她随即在他的唇上轻轻一吻。“别担心了，睡吧，傻瓜。”

Signal from Eva Unit 02 showing no problems.  
EVA 二号机信号显示无异常。

VA connection and fusion are normal. Rate of proliferation is within expected limits.  
VA 连接与融合正常。增殖速率在预期范围内。

Asuka was standing in front of her Evangelion in its cage, her arms crossed. The Eva was getting prepared for the sync test, all she had to do was wait until it was ready. She just stood there, consequently, on the gangway.  
明日香站在她的 EVA 前，双臂交叉。EVA 正在进行同步测试的准备，她只需等待它准备好。她就那样站在过道上，一动不动。

"I always thought you were just a puppet. That all you had just been created to obey my orders..." She said to her Eva glumly. "But I need to know if what I saw was true." She frowned defiantly. "What are you hiding from me ?.. Are you really inside ?"  
“我一直以为你只是个傀儡。你的一切只是为了服从我的命令而创造……”她沮丧地对她的 EVA 说道。“但我需要知道我所见是否为真。”她倔强地皱起眉头。“你在对我隐瞒什么？……你真的在里面吗？”

She didn't get an answer. All she could hear was the low humming of the machines surrounding her and the lapping of the liquid submerging most of her Eva.  
她没有得到回答。她能听到的只有周围机器的低沉嗡鸣声和液体淹没大部分 EVA 的拍打声。

"Did... Did you choose to stop being my mama on purpose ?" She tried to look at the giant before her menacingly, but she had to close her eyes to keep the tears at bay. She took a deep breath. Just before the alarms started blaring.  
"你...你是故意选择不再做我的妈妈吗？" 她试图凶狠地看着面前的巨人，但不得不闭上眼睛以忍住泪水。她深吸了一口气。就在警报开始响起之前。

All hands, battle stations, level one ! Prepare for anti-air combat !  
全体注意，战斗岗位，一级戒备！准备进行防空作战！

"I'll find out eventually ! Just you wait !" She barked. "This Angel just bought you some time !" She added as she ran towards her entry-plug. She wouldn't run away. She would get her answers. Nothing, not even an Angel would stop her.  
"我迟早会弄清楚的！你等着瞧吧！" 她咆哮道。"这个使徒只是给你争取了点时间！" 她边说边跑向她的插入栓。她不会逃跑。她会得到答案。没有什么，即使是使徒也阻止不了她。

.

"Angel visually confirmed. Here is the highest magnification." Aoba said, putting the satellite image of the Angel on the Command Center's main screen. The most angelic looking one so far. It looked like a gigantic pair of wings attached to a body which features could not be seen. The whole creature seemed to be made of light, emphasizing its angelic appearance. It stayed in its place, motionless.  
"使徒已确认。这是最高倍率的图像。" 青叶说道，将使徒的卫星图像放在指挥中心的主屏幕上。到目前为止最天使般的一个。它看起来像是一对巨大的翅膀连接着一个看不见特征的身体。整个生物似乎由光构成，突显出其天使般的外观。它停留在原地，一动不动。

"It isn't budging from its satellite orbit." Hyuga continued, not raising his eyes from his own screen.  
"它没有从卫星轨道上移动的迹象。" 日向继续说道，目光未曾离开自己的屏幕。

"It's maintaining a set distance from our location." Aoba confirmed, trying to find something that could help them in the upcoming battle.  
"它与我们保持了固定的距离。" 青叶确认道，试图在即将到来的战斗中找到有用的信息。

"Which means, it's waiting for a chance to descend and close in, or it can attack us without the need to do so." Misato stated. As usual during battle, she looked calm. She was trying to come up with a strategy to dispose of this new threat.  
"这意味着，它在等待时机下降并逼近，或者它可以直接攻击我们，无需这样做。" 美里陈述道。一如既往地在战斗中，她显得镇定自若。她正努力构思一个策略来消除这个新的威胁。

"We can't make a careless move at this rate." Makoto answered.  
"我们可不能在这种时候轻举妄动。" 真嗣回答道。

"Either way, we can't do anything about it unless the target moves within our firing range. The Eva Units aren't capable of attacking anything in orbit." Misato thought out loud. She was getting worried about the Children.  
"无论如何，除非目标进入我们的射程范围内，否则我们无计可施。Eva 机体是无法攻击轨道上的任何目标的。" 美里自言自语道。她开始为孩子们感到担忧。

"We have three Evas and there's nothing we can do against this target." Aoba said dejected. Every battle was different, making it impossible for them to be able to rely on a strategy that had already worked in the past.  
"我们有三个 Eva，却对这目标束手无策。" 青叶沮丧地说。每场战斗都不同，使得他们无法依赖过去曾奏效的策略。

"That's it !" Misato exclaimed. "A simultaneous shot from the three of them on a set point might be enough to neutralize the Angel !" She opened a comm window with the three Evas. "Everyone's ready ? The target is not moving from orbit. We will have to use all our long-ranged weapons in conjunction with the others to maximize our efficiency and try to destroy it. Shinji, Toji, you'll use the positron rifles. Rei, you'll use the positron sniper rifle."  
"就是这样！" 美里喊道。"他们三人同时在一个定点射击，或许足以中和使徒！" 她打开与三台 EVA 的通讯窗口。"大家都准备好了吗？目标没有离开轨道。我们必须联合使用所有远程武器，以最大化效率并尝试摧毁它。真嗣、渡边，你们使用阳电子步枪。丽，你使用阳电子狙击步枪。"

"Unit 01 will use the sniper rifle." Commander Ikari chimed in before the Children could answer.  
"初号机将使用狙击步枪。" 碇司令在孩子们回答之前插话道。

"Yes sir." Misato answered, puzzled. She decided not to discuss the Commander's orders. "Now. Since the different projectiles you will be using do not travel at the same speed, you will have to rely on a countdown which will tell you when to shoot." She then added in a lighter tone. "I don't expect anything but perfection from you guys ! Good luck !" She winked as she closed the communication with the Evas.  
"是，长官。" 美里回答，感到困惑。她决定不讨论司令的命令。"现在。由于你们将使用的不同弹药速度不一，你们需要依靠倒计时来确定射击时机。" 她接着用轻松的语气补充道。"我对你们的要求只有完美！祝好运！" 她眨眼间关闭了与 EVA 的通讯。

"Yeah. No pressure." Toji said sarcastically. Despite his comment, he felt confident. He had been training a lot in the past month in simulations, so in theory, he knew how to use his weapon. He didn't need more.  
"是啊，没压力。" 冬二讽刺地说道。尽管他这么说，但他感到自信满满。过去一个月里，他在模拟训练中下了很多功夫，所以在理论上，他知道如何使用自己的武器。他不需要更多了。

"Consider yourself lucky. It was way worse when that Angel fell from the sky !" Shinji joked to lighten the mood. At this moment, all three Evangelions got launched to the surface. Shinji went further back and got in position, waiting for the tech crew to finish preparing the weapon while Rei and Toji went next to the catapults which were to bring them theirs.  
"算你走运。那次使徒从天而降的时候可糟糕多了！" 真嗣开玩笑以缓和气氛。此时，三台 EVA 都被发射到了地面上。真嗣退得更远，进入位置，等待技术团队完成武器的准备工作，而丽和冬二则走向了即将为他们发射武器的弹射器旁。

"Aren't we sending Unit 02 ?" Makoto asked. He was monitoring the Pilots so he had a direct video feed from the four entry-plugs, Asuka's included.  
"我们不是要派出零二号机吗？" 真琴问道。他在监控驾驶员，因此直接从四个插入栓中接收到了包括明日香在内的视频信号。

"It's been put on suspension under Commander Ikari's strict orders." Misato answered. 'I suppose it's not surprising after what happened.' She added mentally. She didn't like this. She felt conflicted. On the one hand, she couldn't disagree with the Commander's decision, having seen with her own eyes what Unit 02 was capable of in the last battle. On the other hand, she knew that if the situation was to go bad, Asuka would be very difficult to handle.  
"根据碇司令的严格命令，它已被暂停使用。" 美里回答道。'经历了那样的事情后，这并不令人意外。' 她在心里补充道。她不喜欢这样。她感到矛盾。一方面，她亲眼目睹了二号机在上一场战斗中的能力，无法反驳司令的决定；另一方面，她知道如果情况恶化，明日香将非常难以控制。

.

"The rain feels weird." Toji said to break the silence. The tension was growing with every second. His positron rifle arrived at this moment, he retrieved it and plugged it to its power source.  
"这雨感觉很奇怪。" 冬二说道，试图打破沉默。紧张感每秒都在加剧。此时，他的阳电子步枪送到了，他取过并连接到电源上。

"Yeah. It's the first time I fight in the rain." Shinji answered, his weapon was charged, he only had to wait for the countdown to begin. He looked to his right, to his comm windows. Toji was just putting the targeting system on while Rei was picking up her own positron rifle. She didn't betray any emotion. He wondered for a second what she could be thinking about before focusing back to the battle. He didn't have a comm window opened with Asuka. It wouldn't have been justified, and since it was now official that the Commander was meddling in their private life, it was far too dangerous.  
“嗯，这是我第一次在雨中战斗。” 真嗣回答道，他的武器已经充能完毕，只需等待倒计时开始。他向右看去，目光落在通讯窗口上。剑介正在调整瞄准系统，而绫波则拿起她的阳电子步枪。她没有任何情绪流露。真嗣好奇了一瞬她在想什么，随后便将注意力重新集中到战斗上。他没有打开与明日香的通讯窗口。这并不合理，而且自从指挥官正式介入他们的私生活后，这样做太过危险。

From the corner of his eye he could see Toji aiming his rifle towards the heavens above.  
他用眼角余光瞥见剑介正将步枪瞄准天空。

'Come on come on come on come on' Toji kept repeating this mantra in his head as he was waiting for his reticles to align. "What the ?.."  
“快点快点快点快点” 剑介在心中不断重复着这个咒语，等待着瞄准镜对齐。“什么鬼？..”

"Toji ! Move !" Shinji screamed as a blinding beam of light descended from the sky directly on his friend.  
“冬二！快躲开！” 真嗣尖叫着，一道刺眼的光束从天而降，直冲他的朋友而去。

"Aaaaaaaargh !" Toji shouted at the top of his lungs as his Eva started convulsing.  
“啊啊啊啊啊！” 冬二声嘶力竭地喊着，他的 EVA 开始剧烈抽搐。

.

.

The alarm started in the Command center where everyone was completely stunned by what they were witnessing. "Is it a direct energy weapon ?!" Misato asked urgently.  
指挥中心警报响起，所有人都被眼前的景象惊呆了。“这是直接能量武器吗？！” 美里急切地问道。

"No, I'm not getting any thermal energy readings." Aoba answered.  
“不，我没有检测到任何热能反应。”青叶回答道。

"His psychograph readings are agitated !" Maya looked scared when she shared this information "Mental contamination beginning !"  
“他的心理图谱显示异常波动！”真嗣分享这一信息时显得惊恐，“精神污染开始！”

Ritsuko looked utterly terrified. "The Angel is launching a psychological attack ? They can comprehend the mind of a human being ?" This could have dire consequences.  
律子看起来完全吓坏了。“使徒正在发动心理攻击？它们能理解人类的思想？”这可能会带来灾难性的后果。

.

.

"Goddamn it !" Toji screamed as he started shooting his rifle at random. He kept unloading his weapon, while groaning in pain until it clicked empty. He kept pulling the trigger several times in his pain induced confusion before dropping the positron rifle.  
"该死！" 真嗣尖叫着开始胡乱射击他的步枪。他不停地开火，同时痛苦地呻吟，直到枪支发出空响。在痛苦引发的混乱中，他又多次扣动扳机，最后才丢下阳电子步枪。

"I'm going to help him !" Shinji shouted as he abandoned his position.  
"我要去帮他！" 真嗣大喊着放弃了他的位置。

"No. You have to stay at your position." Commander Ikari said in his coldest voice. He was starting to have enough of his son's attitude. He didn't want him to put Unit 01 in harm's way.  
"不行。你必须坚守你的位置。" 司令碇源堂用他最冷漠的声音说道。他开始受够了儿子的态度。他不希望真嗣让初号机陷入危险之中。

"That wasn't a question, Father." Shinji spat the last word, then added sarcastically. "I'm sorry, but I don't have time to argue with you. My friend is in danger." As he talked, he got his Eva closer to Unit 03. He stopped for a few seconds before charging the Eva as quickly as possible, tackling it outside of the beam of light. The plan would have worked perfectly if the impact had not killed most of his momentum. Now, Shinji was the one trapped in the light.  
"那不是个问题，父亲。" 真嗣吐出最后一个词，然后讽刺地补充道。"对不起，我没时间和你争论。我的朋友正处于危险之中。" 他一边说着，一边让他的 Eva 更靠近 03 号机。他停顿了几秒钟，然后尽可能快地冲向 Eva，将其撞出光束之外。如果撞击没有让他失去大部分动力，这个计划本可以完美执行。现在，真嗣自己被困在了光中。

.

.

"Rei ! Go down into Dogma and use the Lance ! Hurry !"  
"绫波！去到迪格玛，使用长枪！快！"

"The Lance of Longinus ?!" Fuyutsuki asked with evident concern. "Ikari, that is..."  
"朗基努斯之枪？！" 冬月问道，语气中明显带着关切。"碇，那是..."

"This is our only way to bring the target's down. We do not know what the consequences will be for Unit 01. There is no time to waste." Gendo's worry was enough to shut the Sub-Commander up.  
"这是我们唯一能击倒目标的方法。我们不知道对零号机会有什么后果。没有时间可以浪费了。" 碇源堂的担忧足以让副司令闭嘴。

"Analysis of the ray of light ?!" Misato demanded, trying not to listen to Shinji's screams of pain.  
"光线的分析结果？！" 美里要求道，尽量不去听真嗣痛苦的尖叫声。

"It's an energy wave within the visible spectrum ! It's similar to the AT-Field, but details are unknown !" Makoto answered.  
"这是一种可见光谱内的能量波！类似于 AT 力场，但具体细节尚不清楚！" 真希波回答道。

"What about Shinji ?" Ritsuko asked Maya. She couldn't read what was on her screen.  
“那真嗣呢？”律子问真希波。她无法解读屏幕上的内容。

"He's in danger ! The mental contamination has entered Y !" Maya answered, her eyes still fixed on her screen, she didn't want to miss any critical information concerning the Pilot's status.  
“他有危险！精神污染已经进入 Y 区域了！”真希波回答，目光依旧紧盯着屏幕，她不想错过任何有关驾驶员状态的关键信息。

"Monkey-boy ! Do something !" Asuka's scream paralyzed everyone who heard it. It was filled with hope and despair at the same time, with helplessness and terror.  
“猴头小子！快做点什么！”明日香的尖叫让所有听到的人都僵住了。她的声音充满了希望与绝望，无助与恐惧交织。

"Toji can't help him. His plug was ejected as soon as he got out of the light." Misato told her, there was no point in hiding the truth from her.  
“真嗣帮不了他。他一离开光束，插入栓就被弹出了。”美里告诉她，没有必要对她隐瞒真相。

"I'll go then !"  
“那我去吧！”

"No ! Your Eva is frozen. You have to stand by." Misato ordered with as much authority as she could, hoping it would be enough.  
“不行！你的 EVA 被冻结了。你得待命。”美里尽可能用权威的语气命令道，希望这足够说服她。

"Like hell I will !" Was Asuka's answer. She then started to get her Eva free of its restraints in order to make her way towards the elevators.  
“打死我也不干！”明日香回道。随后她开始解开她的 EVA 身上的束缚，准备向电梯方向移动。

"Major." Gendo said. He didn't have to say anything more. The order was very clear.  
“少校。”碇司令说道。他无需多言，命令已经非常明确。

"Increase the pressure of Unit 02's LCL to maximum." Misato ordered, her head low, just loud enough for the crew to hear. She had to. She didn't have a choice. She cut the communication with Unit 02 at the same time, too ashamed of herself to listen to what Asuka would say. She didn't even pay attention to the conversation that was occurring right behind her back.  
“将二号机的 LCL 压力调至最大。”美里命令道，头低垂着，声音刚好能让机组人员听见。她不得不这么做，别无选择。同时，她也切断了与二号机的通讯，羞愧难当，不愿听到明日香的回应。她甚至没有留意身后正在进行的对话。

.

.

"Aaaaaargh ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop it ! Stay out of my head !" Shinji screamed at the top of his lungs. His throat was getting sore, his screams more and more hoarse.  
“啊啊啊啊啊！停下！停下！快停下！别进我的脑袋！” 真嗣声嘶力竭地尖叫着。他的喉咙开始疼痛，喊声也越发沙哑。

"Shinji ! Get out of here ! Fall back !" Misato shouted but Shinji didn't hear her.  
“真嗣！快离开这里！撤退！” 美里喊道，但真嗣没有听到她的声音。

"Aaaaaaaaaargh !"

_Flash_

Shinji was standing in a large room. His father, Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki and Doctor Akagi were behind him. He was just in front of a window, smiling and waving at his mother. She was looking at him for what would be the last time before she entered Unit 01's entry-plug. And before she was wiped from this existence. This memory had always been with him. The Angel just showed him what he had subconsciously repressed for years.  
真嗣站在一个宽敞的房间里。他的父亲、副司令官冬月和博士赤木律子站在他身后。他正对着一扇窗户，微笑着向母亲挥手。这是她进入零号机插入栓前最后一次看着他，也是她从这个世界上消失前的最后一眼。这段记忆一直伴随着他。天使刚刚向他展示了那些他潜意识里压抑多年的回忆。

_Flash_

"Leave me alone !" His voice was getting weaker.  
“别管我！”他的声音越来越弱。

_Flash_

He could barely see anything. His whole vision was filled with reddish orange. He was hot. Very hot. With some effort, he could see his Eva's hand, outstretched as much as possible. He could also see a second hand. Unit 02's. Just out of reach.  
他几乎看不清任何东西。整个视野都被红橙色填满。他感到热，非常热。费了些力气，他能看到自己的 Eva 的手，尽可能地伸展开来。他还能看到另一只手，02 号机的手，就在触手可及之外。

"Shinji ! Shinji !" He could hear her screaming. He had never heard her so terrified in his life. "I don't want to die !" He couldn't see the hand anymore. He had arrived too late. He failed to grab Unit 02 before it sunk in the volcano. "Shinji ! Please ! I don't want to die ! I don't want to..." She didn't have time to finish her plea. The last thing Shinji heard was a loud metallic sound. Then there was only static.  
“真嗣！真嗣！”他能听到她在尖叫。他从未听过她如此恐惧的声音。“我不想死！”他再也看不见那只手了。他来得太迟了。他未能抓住 02 号机，它沉入了火山中。“真嗣！求求你！我不想死！我不想……”她没来得及说完她的恳求。真嗣最后听到的是一声响亮的金属声，随后便只剩下了静电噪音。

_Flash_

"Stop ! Don't ! I don't want to see this." He was crying from the visions, from exhaustion, from pain. There was something else, however, which came with the vision. It wasn't a voice in his head, more like a message imprinted in his mind : 'You could have saved her...'  
"停下！不要！我不想看到这些。" 他因幻象、疲惫和痛苦而哭泣。然而，幻象中还伴随着其他东西。那不是他脑海中的声音，更像是一条刻在他心中的信息：'你本可以救她的...'

_Flash_

Shinji could see inside a derelict house, and more precisely inside the bathroom. There were wood panels everywhere, the ceiling had collapsed so the early morning sunlight could enter the room. Oddly enough, there was a chair still standing with neatly folded clothes on it. The bathtub was bent and rusty. He could see Asuka inside. She looked terrible. Her hair was messy, her cheeks creased, she looked tired and malnourished. She was soaking in tepid reddish water. "There's no reason for me to live now." She said as he came closer Terrified of the sight before his eyes yet incapable of doing anything or even say anything to her. He could see blood spilling from fresh wounds on her wrists.  
真嗣能看到一座废弃的房子内部，更确切地说是在浴室里。到处都是木板，天花板已经坍塌，清晨的阳光得以照进房间。奇怪的是，还有一把椅子依然立着，上面整齐地叠放着衣服。浴缸弯曲生锈。他能看到明日香在里面。她看起来很糟糕。头发凌乱，脸颊皱巴巴的，显得疲惫且营养不良。她泡在温热的微红色水中。"我现在没有理由活下去了。" 她说着，当他走近时，他恐惧于眼前的景象，却无能为力，甚至无法对她说些什么。他能看到鲜血从她手腕上的新伤口中流出。

_Flash_

"Leave me alone." His voice was now very weak. The simple act of speaking seemed painful to him. 'But you abandoned her...'  
"别管我。" 他的声音现在非常微弱。仅仅是说话这个简单的动作似乎都让他感到痛苦。'但你抛弃了她...'

_Flash_

He was now in an entry-plug. What startled him at first was that he wasn't sitting in the Pilot's chair. This early realization was quickly replaced however, by the foul stench filling his nostrils, making him dry heave before he could do anything else. He navigated with difficulty towards the chair. That's when he saw her. Asuka was sitting on the chair. She was dead. She had been for a long time. Her red plugsuit was dirty and seemed hollow. Her hair was dry and looked crusty. What shocked Shinji the most however, was her face.  
他现在身处插入栓内。最初让他惊愕的是，自己并未坐在驾驶员的椅子上。然而，这一早期的认知很快被充斥鼻腔的恶臭所取代，使他在采取任何行动之前就干呕起来。他艰难地向椅子走去。就在那时，他看到了她。明日香坐在椅子上。她已经死了。死了很久。她的红色插入栓服肮脏且显得空洞。她的头发干枯，看起来像结了壳。然而，最让真嗣震惊的是她的脸。

Her skin was dry and rotten were it still stuck to her skull. There were maggots coming and going from the empty cavities of her eye sockets, and even more crawling on her face, the only exposed part of her decaying corpse.  
她的皮肤干燥且腐烂，仍粘附在她的头骨上。蛆虫从她眼窝的空洞中进进出出，更多的则在她的脸上爬行，那是她腐烂尸体唯一暴露的部分。

_Flash_

"Please stop. Stop it. Stop invading my mind." He whispered weakly. 'But you ran away...'  
“请停下来。别再这样了。别再侵入我的心灵。”他虚弱地低语。‘但你逃走了...’

_Flash_

He was on a beach. He could hear the waves lapping gently on the white sand he was kneeling on. The night was eerily clear... And quiet. He was strangling her. He could feel how much pressure he was putting on her windpipe. She wasn't struggling, but he could see out of her right eye that she was alive. He didn't stop. He was begging his own body in his mind to stop. To let her breathe. He wished she would do something to repel him. She didn't move.  
他身处一片海滩。耳边是海浪轻柔地拍打着他跪着的白沙。夜空异常清晰……且寂静。他正掐着她的脖子。他能感觉到自己施加在她气管上的压力有多大。她没有挣扎，但从她的右眼他能看出她还活着。他没有停手。他在心里恳求自己的身体停下来。让她呼吸。他希望她能做些什么来反抗他。她一动不动。

_Flash_

Shinji said nothing, he was holding his knees close to himself, whimpering. 'In the end, it was you who killed her.'  
真嗣一言不发，紧紧抱着自己的膝盖，呜咽着。'最终，是你杀了她。'

_Flash_

The Geofront had been turned into a war zone. Nothing had been left unscathed by the fight happening. A gigantic hole in the cavern's structure let the sun shine through. Shinji was fighting like he had never fought before. He didn't control his movements but he could see the destruction he was causing along with his enemies. He couldn't see them, they looked like blurry white masses. He could also see in the distance Unit 02, also fighting these white masses. And the Jet Alone. The image puzzled him for a second before an ear-splitting explosion brought his attention back to the red Eva, which was nowhere to be found. He knew deep down that the explosion had been Unit 02 self-destructing.  
地底都市已经变成了战场。战斗的痕迹无处不在，巨大的洞口让阳光得以透入。真嗣战斗得前所未有地激烈，他并未操控自己的动作，却能目睹自己与敌人共同造成的破坏。那些敌人看起来像模糊的白色团块，他还能远远望见零号机也在与这些白色团块战斗，还有那台 Jet Alone。这一幕让他困惑了一瞬，直到一声震耳欲聋的爆炸将他的注意力拉回到红色的 EVA 上，而它已消失无踪。他内心深处明白，那爆炸是零号机自毁的结果。

'Because you are weak.'  
'因为你太软弱了。'

_Flash_

This street was familiar. He had already passed by this cinema several times since he had arrived in Tokyo 3. He had wanted to take Asuka there, to have a nice, normal date with her. He was seeing it from afar. He could hear gunshots, he could see bullet holes in several place, shop windows, a food cart, its umbrella... He was witnessing a scene of urban guerrilla. Suddenly, he saw Asuka awkwardly bolt from a storefront she was using as cover. He heard a gunshot, then he heard her scream. He saw her flop ungracefully onto her front.  
这条街道他很熟悉。自从来到东京 3 区后，他已经多次路过这家电影院。他本想带明日香去那里，和她进行一次美好而正常的约会。他远远地望着它。他能听到枪声，能看到多处的弹孔，商店橱窗，一个食品摊，它的遮阳伞……他目睹了一场城市游击战的场景。突然，他看到明日香笨拙地从她用作掩体的店面冲出来。他听到一声枪响，接着是她尖叫的声音。他看到她狼狈地扑倒在地。

'Because you are a coward.'  
'因为你是个懦夫。'

_Flash_

Shinji couldn't even begin to comprehend what was happening. Asuka was clothed in a black duffel coat, in a snowstorm, aiming a rifle at a wolf. She looked exhausted and famished, with dark rings around her eyes, on top of creased cheeks. The noise from the rifle pierced his ears as she shot the wolf down. The creature fell onto her, knocking her down. She shot a second wolf before several others jumped on her. She screamed as she managed to smash one of her assailants' jaw with her rifle. They were too many, however. She was surrounded. Two wolves were biting at her limbs as a third one was trying to rip her face off with its powerful jaw.  
真嗣完全无法理解正在发生的事情。明日香穿着一件黑色羽绒外套，在暴风雪中，举枪瞄准一只狼。她看起来疲惫不堪，饥饿难耐，眼圈乌黑，脸颊上还有皱纹。随着她开枪射中狼，枪声刺穿了他的耳膜。那只狼倒在她身上，将她撞倒。她又射中了一只狼，但随后几只狼扑向了她。她尖叫着，用枪托砸碎了一只攻击者的下巴。然而，狼太多了。她被包围了。两只狼咬住了她的四肢，第三只则试图用它强有力的下颚撕裂她的脸。

'Because you did nothing.'  
'因为你什么都没做。'

_Flash_

He knew that scene. It was during the fight against the Angel which took control of Toji's Evangelion. Unit 01 was holding Toji's entry-plug in its hand, squeezing it. However, this time, nobody came before he managed to crush it with his own hand.  
他记得那个场景。那是在与控制了冬二 EVA 的使徒战斗时。初号机正握着冬二的插入栓，挤压着它。然而这一次，在他亲手将其捏碎之前，没有人前来阻止。

'You...'

_Flash_

He was in his entry-plug, looking at a battlefield. He could see Unit 00 struggling against an enemy he could not identify. Suddenly, Unit 00 disappeared in a blinding light.  
他身处自己的插入栓内，望着一片战场。他能看到零号机正与一个无法辨认的敌人搏斗。突然间，零号机在一阵刺眼的光芒中消失了。

'Killed...'

_Flash_

Misato was sitting on the floor, inside a corridor of the Geofront. She was breathing heavily. She had her back against a door which led to an elevator. As Shinji saw more details, he could see that she was bleeding from a gunshot. Blood was also dripping from her mouth. Her breathing was getting shallower with each breath.  
美里坐在地面上，位于地底都市的一个走廊里。她呼吸急促，背靠着一扇通往电梯的门。随着真嗣观察到更多细节，他发现她被枪击中，鲜血从伤口流出，嘴角也有血滴落。她的呼吸随着每一次呼吸变得越来越浅。

'Them...'

_Flash_

Shinji was standing in another corridor of the Geofront. It smelled like burning. As he took in his surroundings, he understood where the smell came from. Dozens of corpses littered the floor, some of them had been shot. Most of them, however, had been burned alive.  
真嗣站在地底都市的另一个走廊里，空气中弥漫着烧焦的味道。当他环顾四周时，明白了这股味道的来源。数十具尸体散落在地板上，其中一些是被枪杀的。然而，大多数是被活活烧死的。

'All.'

.

.

Unit 01 has shut down ! Life support has developed a problem !  
初号机已关闭！生命维持系统出现故障！

"Pilot entering a dangerous state !" Maya exclaimed, incapable of hiding how worried she was about Shinji.  
“驾驶员进入危险状态！”玛雅惊呼，无法掩饰她对真嗣的担忧。

"No change in target." Aoba added. "Relative distance has remained the same."  
"目标未发生变化。" 青叶补充道，"相对距离保持不变。"

"Probability of it moving within firing range is 0.02%." Makoto finished the status report.  
"其在射程内移动的概率为 0.02%。" 真嗣完成了状态报告。"

.

.

Rei was finally getting back to the surface, the Lance of Longinus in her right hand. She had never ran this fast in her life. She had experimented feelings she was very unfamiliar with for the first time. Fear for her fellow pilots. Fear for Shinji. Frustration. The cable lowering her Eva to the depths of the Geofront was excruciatingly slow, so much that she had to cut her communications with everyone. She couldn't stand hearing Shinji's screams of agony. Each scream was tearing a hole in her soul. For the first time ever she also felt helplessness.  
绫波终于回到了地面，右手紧握着朗基努斯之枪。她从未如此拼命奔跑过。第一次体验到了许多陌生的情感：对同伴驾驶员的担忧，对真嗣的恐惧，还有挫败感。降下 EVA 至地底都市的缆绳慢得令人痛苦，以至于她不得不切断了与所有人的通讯。她无法忍受听到真嗣痛苦的尖叫声，每一声都像是在撕裂她的灵魂。这是她第一次感到如此无助。

"Unit 00, prepared to throw." Aoba said.  
"初号机，准备投掷。" 青叶说道。

"Target confirmed. Adjustment for errors made." Makoto declared.  
"目标已确认。进行误差调整。" 真琴宣布。

"Beginning countdown." Maya stated. "T-minus ten seconds."  
"开始倒计时。" 真耶陈述。"十秒倒计时。"

Upon hearing that, Rei got into position and started running before throwing the Lance with all her Eva's strength towards the Angel. A bestial wail came from the Eva as it threw the weapon. Shinji's screams had stopped, which had terrified her even more. She was expecting the worst. At least when he screamed she had proof that he was still alive.  
听到这话，丽迅速就位并开始奔跑，然后用 EVA 的全部力量将长枪投向使徒。EVA 发出野兽般的嚎叫，将武器掷出。真嗣的尖叫声已经停止，这让她更加恐惧。她预料到了最坏的情况。至少当他尖叫时，她还能证明他还活着。

Maya had just said "eight" when the Lance left her hand and flew through the clouds, dissipating them at the same time, allowing the sun to shine unobstructed on Tokyo 3, then breaking through the Angel's AT-Field like it wasn't even there before piercing its core and destroying it.  
玛雅刚数到“八”，长枪就脱手而出，穿云破雾，让阳光无阻地照耀在第三新东京市上，随后如同无物般突破使徒的 AT 力场，直刺其核心并将其摧毁。

"Target has been destroyed." Rei heard Aoba confirm. She cut her communications again and rested her head on her chair's headrest and exhaled, closing her eyes, physically and mentally drained by the battle.  
“目标已被摧毁。”青叶确认道。丽再次切断通讯，将头靠在椅子的头枕上，长舒一口气，闭上眼睛，身心俱疲地结束了这场战斗。

.

.

Shinji was sitting on the floor, right next to the lift that was bringing his Evangelion back to its cage. He wasn't moving, seemingly oblivious to the behemoth's face in front of him, the slow beeping of the alarm or the cicadas' stridulations. He also seemed oblivious to the footsteps which were quickly approaching him.  
真嗣坐在地板上，就在升降机旁边，升降机正将他的 EVA 送回笼中。他一动不动，似乎对面前巨兽的脸庞、缓慢的警报声或蝉的鸣叫声都毫无察觉。他似乎也没有注意到正迅速向他逼近的脚步声。

"Shinji !" Asuka was furious at Misato, but now was not the time. Shinji had been hurt during this fight. She didn't want him to be hurt. So she wanted to be there for him, to help him go through this. She had heard him. Heard every single word he had said. Heard his silence. She couldn't begin to imagine what it must have felt like to have his mind violated by this monster. "Shinji ! Are you okay ?" He didn't move. He just sat there.  
“真嗣！”明日香对美里感到愤怒，但此刻并非发泄之时。真嗣在这场战斗中受伤了。她不希望他受伤。所以她想陪在他身边，帮助他度过这一切。她听到了他。听到了他说的每一个字。听到了他的沉默。她无法想象他的心灵被这怪物侵犯时是何种感受。“真嗣！你还好吗？”他没有动。只是坐在那里。

She didn't care that the Commander would see her. She didn't care about anything except him, she just wanted him to be safe. She swiftly ducked under the quarantine tape and got in front of him, putting her left hand on his shoulder and raising his head with her right. "Shin..."  
她不在乎指挥官是否会看到她。除了他，她什么都不在乎，只希望他能平安无事。她迅速弯腰穿过隔离带，走到他面前，左手搭在他的肩膀上，右手抬起他的头。“真嗣……”

She fell silent as she saw him. She understood when she looked directly into his blank, emotionless, cobalt stare... Into these empty eyes which usually expressed so much emotions, which always made her feel butterflies in her stomach. She understood in a heartbeat that something was wrong with him. She knew this expression. She had seen it before. At this moment, she felt very, very small. As if she were four again. "Shinji... Please... Don't... Don't stop being my Shinji."  
"她看到他时沉默了。当她直视他那空洞、无情的钴蓝色目光时，她立刻明白了... 那双通常充满情感、总让她心动的空洞眼睛。她瞬间意识到他有些不对劲。她熟悉这种表情。她曾见过。此刻，她感到自己非常渺小，仿佛回到了四岁。“真嗣... 请... 不要... 不要不再是我的真嗣。”

### Chapter 15 : The one that got away
Hey ! long time so nee ! Here's a new chapter ! And this one has been a pain in the ass to write !  
嘿！好久不见！新章节来啦！这一章写得可真是费劲！

On a side note, I think that I'll stop posting here after this chapter. Every time I get the message that I'm spamming etc and I don't like it (maybe if I didn't take as much time between chapters this wouldn't be a problem !). Anyway, I'll still update the story on ff.net of course.  
顺便提一下，我想这章之后就不在这里更新了。每次收到说我刷屏之类的消息，我都不太喜欢（也许如果我不隔那么久更新章节，这问题就不会出现了！）。不过，我当然还会在 ff.net 上更新故事。

I think I'll post everything once the story is over here, I don't know. And I still have some time to think about it !  
我想等这里的故事完结后，再一次性发布所有内容，我也不确定。而且我还有时间考虑这件事！

Anyway ! here's chapter 15 :  
总之！这是第 15 章：

It had left her paralyzed. Numb. It wasn't true. It couldn't be. She didn't move when they took Shinji away on a stretcher. She just automatically followed when two Section 2 agents helped her up roughly and put her in a car.  
这让她陷入了瘫痪。麻木。这不可能是真的。她一动不动地看着他们用担架把真嗣抬走。当两名第二分部的特工粗鲁地扶她起来并把她塞进车里时，她只是机械地跟着。

Her shock didn't dissipate. She wandered aimlessly from room to room in the apartment. Sometimes she sat somewhere, on a chair, on the couch, other times she just paced, still wearing her plugsuit. It had been a pragmatic decision at the time, she wanted to get to Shinji as soon as possible so she didn't shower nor change before she came to see him. And she couldn't think about anything else since she had seen him. Her hair was coated in dry LCL. She reeked of blood. She couldn't care less. Shinji was gone. Exactly like her mother before.  
她的震惊没有消散。她在公寓里漫无目的地从一个房间游荡到另一个房间。有时她会坐下，椅子上，沙发上，其他时候她只是来回踱步，依旧穿着她的插入栓服。当时这是一个务实的决定，她想尽快见到真嗣，所以没有洗澡也没有换衣服就赶来了。自从见到他后，她无法思考其他任何事情。她的头发上沾满了干涸的 LCL。她浑身血腥味。她毫不在意。真嗣走了。就像她母亲之前一样。

When she finally came to her senses, she was standing between the doors of his former room and hers. Their room. Her Shinji had been ripped away from her. Of course, he was still there physically, however, the same couldn't be said for his mind. She didn't need to wait for a diagnosis to know. She had already seen it all before. She collapsed on her knees right there, in the corridor. For the first time in over a decade, Asuka Langley Soryu broke down. There was no pretending anymore at this moment. She didn't even care if Misato came back home right now. She couldn't take it anymore. Too much had happened in too little time. It had only been a week since she had been salvaged from her Eva. And during this week, she had lost the two most important persons in her life. And she had been betrayed by her guardian. The same woman who was supposed to be there for her. And there were still all the questions she had concerning her mother.  
当她终于回过神来，发现自己正站在他曾经的房间和她房间之间的门口。他们的房间。她的真嗣被夺走了。当然，他身体上还在这里，但他的心灵却已不复存在。她不需要等待诊断结果就能知道。她早已目睹过这一切。她就在走廊上跪倒在地。十多年来，惣流·明日香·兰格雷第一次崩溃了。此刻已无需再伪装。她甚至不在乎美里现在是否回家。她再也承受不住了。太多的事情在太短的时间内发生。仅仅一周前，她才从 EVA 中获救。而在这周里，她失去了生命中最重要的两个人。还被她的监护人背叛了。那个本应守护她的女人。还有关于她母亲的种种疑问，依然悬而未决。

So, at this moment, she laid down her walls and cried. She screamed and wailed unintelligibly, covering the ringing phone with her despair.  
所以，此刻，她放下了所有的防备，痛哭失声。她尖叫着，哭喊着，无法理解地用绝望掩盖了响起的电话。

Eventually, she calmed down. Almost automatically. It was over now, she had cried enough. She stood up and went to the living room. The sun was already low in the horizon. It was obvious now that neither Shinji nor Misato would come back home tonight. She had expected that much. Misato could say what she wanted, she had proved that she didn't care about her as much as she pretended to. She went to the bathroom and turned the bathtub tap before shedding her plugsuit. "She could have called, at least..." She whispered to herself.  
最终，她平静了下来。几乎是自然而然的。现在一切都结束了，她已经哭够了。她站起身，走向客厅。太阳已经低垂在地平线上。显然，无论是真嗣还是美里今晚都不会回家了。她早有预料。美里说什么都无所谓，她已经证明了自己并不像她假装的那样在乎她。她走进浴室，打开浴缸的水龙头，然后脱下插入栓服。“至少她可以打个电话的...”她自言自语道。

She wouldn't admit it, but crying her eyes out had soothed her. And soaking in hot water relaxed her even further. She was exhausted and unable to hang to a thought for more than a few seconds. In this blissful torpor, her bad memories didn't come to haunt her. The overwhelming ache in her heart was dulled. She dried herself quickly and left the bathroom with a towel loosely tied around her. She didn't care about such a mundane thing. Nobody was there to see her.  
她不会承认，但痛哭一场确实让她感到舒缓。而泡在热水里更是让她进一步放松。她筋疲力尽，无法长时间抓住任何一个念头。在这种愉悦的迟钝中，糟糕的记忆没有来困扰她。心中那股强烈的痛楚也变得迟钝了。她迅速擦干身体，用一条松松垮垮的毛巾裹住自己，离开了浴室。她不在乎这种琐事。没有人会在那里看到她。

She didn't want to be alone. She had never wanted to despite how she acted around others. She went to Shinji's old room without even realizing it. When she saw where she was, she began to turn around to leave when something caught her eye. There, in this dark room, she noticed something that wasn't in its place. The room was as clean and tidy as ever, the bed was neatly made, everything was in its place. 'He's always expecting me to kick him out.' She thought bitterly. 'It wouldn't be the first time...' She hated herself for that. She didn't want to push him away, sometimes she just couldn't help herself. And now it was too late to make things right.  
她不想独自一人。尽管她在别人面前的表现如此，但她从未有过这样的愿望。她不知不觉地走到了真嗣的旧房间。当她意识到自己在哪里时，正准备转身离开，却有什么东西吸引了她的目光。在这个昏暗的房间里，她注意到有些东西不在原位。房间一如既往地干净整洁，床铺整理得一丝不苟，一切都井然有序。“他总是以为我会把他赶出去。”她苦涩地想，“这已经不是第一次了……”她为此痛恨自己。她并不想推开他，只是有时候她控制不住自己。而现在，想要弥补已经太迟了。

However, there was something on his bed that shouldn't have been there. The t-shirt he had been wearing the night before. The salmon shirt he also wore when they first kissed. She hated that shirt. It was the embodiment of the boy's lack of a fashion sense. It was far too big for his small frame, not to mention the color ! That being said, she also loved it because of what it reminded her. It was the shirt he had been wearing when he took his most important step towards her. When for the first time in a long time, she had felt safe with someone.  
然而，他的床上有些不该出现的东西。那件他前一晚穿过的 T 恤，那件三文鱼色的衬衫，他们初次接吻时他也穿着它。她讨厌那件衬衫。它体现了这个男孩对时尚的无知。对于他瘦小的身躯来说，这件衬衫太大了，更别提颜色了！尽管如此，她也爱它，因为它让她想起了什么。那是他向她迈出最重要一步时穿的衬衫。那是久违以来，她第一次在别人身边感到安全。

Without even thinking about it, she dropped her towel on the floor and put his shirt on. She then went to his desk and grabbed his SDAT before leaving to her room to put on underwear and a pair of loose shorts. Finally, she got on her bed, put the headphones in her ears and lulled herself to sleep with his music and his fading scent.  
她毫不犹豫地扔掉毛巾，穿上他的衬衫。然后走到他的书桌前，抓起他的 SDAT，回到自己的房间穿上内衣和一条宽松的短裤。最后，她躺在床上，将耳机塞进耳朵，伴着他的音乐和他逐渐消散的气息，渐渐入睡。

.

.

She woke up in a cold sweat. It was the middle of the night. She didn't remember falling asleep. The day's events had taken a toll on her. That didn't mean she was to get some rest. Her nightmares came back with a vengeance. Shinji wasn't there to shield her from them. Even worse, he had been the main tormentor of this new nightmare. It had started like an old one, she was looking in a hospital room through a glass panel. She expected to see her mother, as she was used to. The horror started when she saw Shinji. He was sitting on the hospital bed, his hair was longer and messier and he was wearing a hospital gown. He was holding something in his arms, almost cradling it, caressing its red hair.  
她惊醒过来，浑身冷汗。夜已深沉，她不记得自己何时入睡。白日的事件让她身心俱疲。但这并不意味着她能得到片刻安宁。她的噩梦卷土重来，变本加厉。真嗣不在身边保护她免受其扰。更糟糕的是，他竟成了这场新噩梦的主使。一切始于一个熟悉的场景，她透过玻璃窗望向病房。本以为会看到母亲，如同往常一样。但当她看到真嗣时，恐惧油然而生。他坐在病床上，头发更长更凌乱，穿着病号服。他怀中抱着什么，仿佛在呵护，轻抚着那红色的头发。

"I love you Asuka. I'll always be there for you." She wanted to move, to run away from this torture. Shinji was there, whispering sweet nothings to a doll instead of her. That same doll her Mother took care of before she took her own life. He told her things he had already told her, mixed with things she wished he would tell her, even if she hadn't realized it before.  
“我爱你，明日香。我会一直在你身边。”她想动身，逃离这折磨。真嗣就在那里，对着一个玩偶低语甜言蜜语，而非对她。那个玩偶，正是她母亲生前照顾过的，直至她选择结束自己的生命。他对她说着那些已经说过的话，混杂着她希望他说的，即便她之前未曾意识到。

This sight alone was already unsettling. It was only the beginning, unfortunately for her. "Please Asuka... Why won't you talk to me ?" Each word was uttered with so much pain that it made her flinch.  
这景象本身已足够令人不安。不幸的是，这只是开始。“求你了，明日香……你为什么不跟我说话？”每一个字都带着如此深的痛苦，让她不禁退缩。

"Shinji !" She screamed through the glass. He didn't react, as if he couldn't hear her.  
“真嗣！”她透过玻璃尖叫。他没有反应，仿佛听不见她。

"Answer me ! Talk to me !.. I'm begging you !" He cried, his tears falling on the doll's head. She was crying too, watching, powerless, the scene before her eyes. He was breathing heavily, tears occasionally falling from his eyes. She couldn't see his face anymore. Suddenly, he grabbed the doll by its neck and started squeezing. "If you won't talk to me, then you'll die with me !" He finally shouted as he ripped the doll's head. The expression on his face absolutely terrified her. She knew this part of him existed. It broke her heart to see him deliberately hurt her. And at this moment, just before she woke up, she realized how much she was scared of him.  
“回答我！跟我说话！……我在求你！”他哭喊着，泪水滴落在玩偶头上。她也在哭泣，无力地看着眼前的场景。他呼吸急促，泪水不时从眼中滑落。她再也看不见他的脸了。突然，他抓住玩偶的脖子开始用力挤压。“如果你不跟我说话，那我们就一起死！”他终于大喊着扯下了玩偶的头。他脸上的表情绝对吓到了她。她知道他这一面存在。看到他故意伤害她，她的心都碎了。而就在她醒来之前的那一刻，她意识到自己有多么害怕他。

She couldn't help but sob quietly in her bed as her dream gave way to reality. She kept repeating herself that it was just a dream in her head. That he would never hurt her, he had told her so. His SDAT had stopped a few hours earlier when the tape ended. It was next to her head, the headphones entangled on the mattress. She hugged herself and breathed his scent on his shirt's sleeve. She didn't move, except for the occasional sob that she couldn't control, ignoring her rumbling stomach. She eventually calmed down and got out of bed as the sun rose, unable to ignore her hunger anymore.  
她忍不住在床上低声啜泣，梦境逐渐让位于现实。她不断对自己重复，那只是一场梦，他永远不会伤害她，他曾这样告诉过她。他的 SDAT 在几个小时前磁带结束时就停止了。它就在她头旁边，耳机缠绕在床垫上。她抱着自己，呼吸着他衬衫袖子上的气息。她没有动，除了偶尔无法控制的啜泣，无视着咕咕叫的肚子。最终，她平静下来，随着太阳升起，无法再忽视饥饿，走下了床。

As she passed next to the phone, she saw the blinking light of the answering machine. She pushed the button and kept going to the refrigerator. "Asuka, it's me. Shinji has to stay in observation tonight. They want to keep him in the mental ward. I promise I'll bring him home as soon as possible. In the meantime, please take care of yourself. I'll come home tomorrow anyway. Bye !"  
当她经过电话旁时，看到了答录机闪烁的灯光。她按下按钮，继续走向冰箱。“明日香，是我。真嗣今晚得留在观察室。他们想让他待在精神科病房。我保证会尽快带他回家。这段时间请照顾好自己。我明天无论如何都会回家。再见！”

"Like you give a damn !" She shouted at the answering machine. She had not forgotten what happened the day before. She hadn't forgotten that she hadn't been able to help Shinji because of her. Because she had betrayed her. Because she had betrayed them both. 'She's coming back today ? I'll give her one hell of a welcoming party.' She thought as she grabbed a club sandwich in the fridge and a small bag of chips in a cupboard. This was going to be a long day.  
“你才不在乎呢！”她对着答录机吼道。她没有忘记昨天发生的事。她没有忘记自己没能帮助真嗣是因为她。因为她背叛了她。因为她背叛了他们俩。‘她今天回来？我要给她一个难忘的欢迎会。’她想着，从冰箱里抓起一个俱乐部三明治，又从橱柜里拿了一小袋薯片。这将是一个漫长的日子。

.

She had been dozing on the couch when she heard the front door hissed open. It took her some time to register the sound before she sprang to her feet and dashed through the apartment. She had been torturing herself for most of the day until her body couldn't take it anymore.  
她原本在沙发上打盹，突然听到前门嘶嘶地打开。她花了些时间才反应过来，然后一跃而起，冲过公寓。她一整天都在折磨自己，直到身体再也承受不住。

She stopped abruptly when she saw them. Seeing him instantly made her feel better. She didn't feel tired or desperate anymore. Even her anger towards Misato had vanished. Maybe he was okay. It was the only thing that mattered. She lunged at him and embraced him tightly. She didn't even spare a glance towards Misato. There would be time to deal with her. Right now, she just felt relieved to see him. She failed to realize that something wasn't quite right.  
她突然停了下来，看到他们时。看到他立刻让她感觉好多了。她不再感到疲惫或绝望。甚至连对美里子的愤怒也消失了。也许他没事。这是唯一重要的事情。她向他扑去，紧紧拥抱他。她甚至没有看美里子一眼。会有时间处理她的。现在，她只是感到见到他很欣慰。她没有意识到有些事情不太对劲。

"Asuka, we need to talk." Misato said as Asuka released Shinji, who had not embraced her back.  
"明日香，我们需要谈谈。" 美里说道，此时明日香放开了真嗣，他没有回抱她。

"What ?" She snarled as she finally looked at her boyfriend's eyes. Her heart sank when she saw his blank expression. His still empty eyes. She wanted to lash out at her commanding officer, but she knew that she wouldn't be able to conceal her sorrow. She didn't want Misato to see.  
"什么？" 她咆哮着，终于看向男友的眼睛。看到他空洞的表情，她的心沉了下去。他依旧空洞的眼神。她想对指挥官发火，但她知道无法掩饰自己的悲伤。她不想让美里看到。

"I understand that you're angry." Misato continued. She knew that she deserved everything Asuka would throw her. She also knew that now was not the time. They had to take care of Shinji first. Then, she would accept the Second Child's ire. This was the best plan she could come up with. She was exhausted too. She had not slept since the attack. She had hoped it would bring her some sympathy.  
"我明白你在生气。" 美里继续说。她知道自己理应承受明日香的一切责难。她也知道现在不是时候。他们得先照顾好真嗣。然后，她会接受二号机的怒火。这是她能想到的最佳计划。她也很疲惫。自袭击以来她就没睡过觉。她曾希望这能换来一些同情。

"Oh you understand !?" Asuka asked rhetorically. "Let me tell you one thing, Major, you have no idea how angry I am !" Misato's last sentence had been enough to rekindle the flames of her anger.  
"哦，你明白了吗？！" 明日香反问着。"让我告诉你一件事，少校，你根本不知道我有多生气！" 美里最后那句话足以重新点燃她心中的怒火。

"Asuka !" Misato shouted to silence her. "I really messed up this time. I know. Believe me. I couldn't think straight back then. I thought I was protecting you from the Commander but I only managed to screw everything up." She paused for a second as she felt a tear roll down her right cheek. "I'm sorry."  
"明日香！" 美里大声喝止她。"这次我真的搞砸了。我知道。相信我。那时候我无法冷静思考。我以为我在保护你免受司令的侵害，结果却把一切都搞砸了。" 她停顿了一下，感觉到一滴泪珠从右脸颊滑落。"对不起。"

"That doesn't change anything." Asuka's anger had receded a little. She could see how affected Misato was. "You know that I could have helped him." Her voice was low and filled with tension. "Because of you he was alone out there ! You let that thing rape his mind !" Her voice cracked, but she kept looking Misato in the eyes.  
"这改变不了什么。" 明日香的怒气稍稍减退了些。她能看出美里的情绪波动。"你知道我本可以帮他的。" 她的声音低沉而充满紧张。"因为你，他孤身一人在外！你让那东西侵犯了他的心灵！" 她的声音哽咽，但她依然直视着美里的眼睛。

She had to stay strong to convince Asuka, so she tried not to flinch at what she last said. "... You're right." She was. Even his Father had done something to shorten Shinji's ordeal, she thought for a second before shaking off this preposterous idea. Shinji had suffered through this because of the Commander. If she started taking all the blame for herself, she was going to go crazy and right now she couldn't afford to. Asuka had not been the only one to torture herself after the debacle that was the last Angel fight. "I'll understand if you never forgive me. I won't blame you if you hate me." She was openly crying now. Her voice didn't crack however. "But we have to be there for him. I need you to trust me on this." She wasn't sure how Asuka was going to take that last sentence. She had to take the chance.  
她必须保持坚强以说服明日香，因此她尽量不因最后那句话而退缩。“……你说得对。”确实如此。即便是他的父亲也曾做过什么来缩短真嗣的苦难，她这样想了一秒钟，随即甩开了这个荒谬的想法。真嗣遭受这一切都是因为司令。如果她开始把所有责任揽在自己身上，她会疯掉的，而此刻她承受不起。在最后一次使徒战斗的灾难之后，不仅仅是明日香在折磨自己。“如果你永远不原谅我，我也不会怪你。如果你恨我，我不会责怪你。”她现在公开地哭泣着。然而，她的声音并没有破裂。“但我们需要在他身边。我需要你在这件事上信任我。”她不确定明日香会如何接受最后一句话。她必须抓住这个机会。

"Trust you ?" She didn't take it well. "How am I supposed to trust you ? How could we trust you after what you did ?" She decided to include Shinji, mainly to hurt Misato more. She knew that Shinji would have accepted had their roles been swapped.  
“信任你？”她接受得并不好。“我怎么可能信任你？在你做了那些事之后，我们怎么可能信任你？”她决定把真嗣也包括进来，主要是为了更深地伤害美里。她知道如果角色互换，真嗣会接受的。

"You think this is easy for me ?" She exclaimed. "I care about you guys as if you were my own kids !"  
“你以为这对我来说容易吗？”她喊道。“我把你们当作自己的孩子一样关心！”

"Then you really have no excuse for what you did." Asuka lamented.  
"那么你真的没有借口为你的所作所为了。" 明日香哀叹道。

"You would have been fired !" Misato shouted. "Again ! Do you think this would have helped ?"  
"你早就被炒鱿鱼了！" 美里大喊。"又一次！你以为这会有帮助吗？"

"I don't care !" This surprised her more than anyone else. A few months ago, being fired would have been the worst thing that could have happened to her. "At least he wouldn't have been like this." She added in a more subdued tone.  
"我不在乎！" 这让她自己都感到惊讶。几个月前，被解雇本是她能想象到的最糟糕的事情。"至少他不会变成这样。" 她用更柔和的语气补充道。

Misato realized at this moment how affected her charge was. She decided to take a different approach to try and defuse the situation. She had made a colossal mistake, now it was her duty to fix it. "You remember my scar ?" Asuka didn't react. She continued nonetheless. "I am the only survivor of the Katsuragi expedition. I was in Antarctica when it happened. I saw the Second Impact first hand." She lowered her gaze because of the painful memories. Despite her anger, Asuka stayed silent, her eyes still locked on her Guardian. "After that, I spent years like him." She looked back at Asuka and spoke with more emotions. "Years ! Because they put me in a hospital room ! Alone ! Please Asuka. I know what I did was inexcusable, and I know I don't deserve your forgiveness. I just need your help !"  
"在这一刻，美里意识到她的监护人受到了多么大的影响。她决定采取不同的方法来试图化解这一局面。她犯了一个巨大的错误，现在她的责任是纠正它。“你记得我的伤疤吗？”明日香没有反应。她继续说道：“我是葛城探险队唯一的幸存者。当时我在南极，亲眼目睹了第二次冲击。”她因为痛苦的记忆而垂下了目光。尽管愤怒，明日香依然保持沉默，她的眼睛仍然锁定在她的监护人身上。“在那之后，我和他一样度过了多年。”她再次看向明日香，带着更多的情感说道，“多年！因为他们把我关在医院病房里！独自一人！请明日香。我知道我所做的不可原谅，我也知道我不配得到你的宽恕。我只是需要你的帮助！””

It felt strange to Asuka to see Misato begging her like this. It didn't sound like her. She looked at Shinji, who still hadn't moved from his spot in the corridor. "... I can't." She said as she headed for the front door.  
对明日香来说，看到美里这样恳求她感到很奇怪。这听起来不像她。她看着真嗣，他仍然没有从走廊的位置移动。“……我做不到。”她说着朝前门走去。

"What you can't do is leave !" Misato was screaming at her now. Not only with anger, but also with desperation. "He needs us !" She realized that it wasn't a good idea to put herself at the same level as Asuka after what she had done. Asuka had just finished putting her shoes on. "He needs you." She said more calmly. Asuka stopped in her tracks. "More than anyone else."  
“你不能做的就是离开！”美里现在对她大喊大叫。不仅是愤怒，还有绝望。“他需要我们！”她意识到，在做了那些事后，把自己放在与明日香同等的位置上并不是个好主意。明日香刚刚穿好鞋子。“他需要你。”她更平静地说。明日香停下了脚步。“比任何人都需要。”

Asuka was standing in front of the door, her back turned to Misato. Nobody could see the tears on her face. "I know how this ends Misato." She said, her voice cracking a little. "I've already witnessed it." She opened the front door. "I can't see it happen again.". She didn't tell her about the nightmare she had and that she was scared to stay in case it would really happen. She left without waiting for an answer. Misato didn't try to catch her.  
明日香站在门前，背对着美里。没人能看到她脸上的泪水。“我知道这结局，美里。”她说，声音有些哽咽。“我已经见证过了。”她打开了前门。“我不能再看到它发生。”她没有告诉美里她做的噩梦，以及她害怕留下来以防噩梦成真。她没有等待回答就离开了。美里没有试图追她。

She stayed in the corridor, looking at the front door. Her tears had dried when she went to the living room. She had failed. On her way, she sat Shinji on one of the kitchen's chair.  
她站在走廊里，望着前门。当她走进客厅时，泪水已经干了。她失败了。在路上，她让真嗣坐在厨房的一把椅子上。

Her eyes caught the picture on the wall as she was about to get to her room. She looked at it with more attention. She fell to her knees, still looking at it. It reminded her that she was alone now. "Goddammit." She whispered into the empty room.  
她正要走进房间时，目光被墙上的照片吸引。她更加专注地凝视着它，跪倒在地，依旧盯着那张照片。这让她意识到自己现在是孤独一人。“该死。”她对着空荡荡的房间低声说道。

Shinji still hadn't moved.  
真嗣仍然一动不动。

.

.

She walked for a long time, not paying attention to the people around her. There were not a lot anyway. They were scared after that last battle. If she had been in the mood to make jokes, she would have said something about thanking Toji for destroying half the city.  
她走了很久，对周围的人视而不见。反正也没多少人。经历了上一场战斗后，大家都害怕了。如果她有心情开玩笑的话，她可能会说些感谢真治毁掉半个城市的话。

She arrived at her destination rather late. She had to squint to shield her eyes from the rays of the setting sun in front of her. She stood there, a few meters from where she had seen the Third Child after his battle against the fifteenth Angel. She wiped a bit of sweat from her forehead as she took in her surroundings. It had only been a day so nothing had changed. The security tape was still there, the only reminder of the Third Child's makeshift quarantine.  
她到达目的地时已相当晚。她不得不眯起眼睛，遮挡眼前落日的余晖。她站在那里，距离上次看到第三适格者在对抗第十五使徒后的地方仅几米之遥。她擦去额头上的汗珠，环顾四周。仅仅过了一天，一切都没有改变。安全胶带依旧在那里，是第三适格者临时隔离的唯一痕迹。

She looked to the spot where Shinji had been sitting the day before. The spot where all her hopes came crashing down. When she saw that the only person helping her was no longer there. She didn't want to run away. She wanted to be there for him. As he was... Used to be there for her. She just couldn't. She still, after all these years, had nightmares about her mother, she wouldn't be able to bear seeing it happen to Shinji. So she left. She couldn't stay there. It was too painful.  
她望向昨天真嗣坐过的地方。那个让她的所有希望破灭的地方。当她发现唯一帮助她的人已不在那里时。她不想逃跑。她想在那里陪着他。就像他曾经...习惯于陪伴她那样。但她做不到。尽管这么多年过去了，她仍会梦见母亲，她无法承受看到真嗣也经历同样的事情。所以她离开了。她无法留在那里。那太痛苦了。

She stared ahead until a sound brought her out of her trance. A melody. One that was so close to her heart that it would have brought a tear to her eye if she had not controlled herself. Someone close was humming the Ode to Joy. A single tear managed to escape her eye as she closed her eyelids, images of the concert appearing in her mind.  
她凝视前方，直到一声响动将她从恍惚中唤醒。一段旋律。那旋律如此贴近她的心，若非她极力克制，早已泪流满面。有人在附近哼唱着《欢乐颂》。她闭上眼睑，一滴泪珠悄然滑落，脑海中浮现出音乐会的画面。

"Singing is great. Singing enriches the soul. It's the crowning achievement of the civilization that the Lilim created." Said the person who had been singing. This cryptic sentence brought her back from her wistful reminiscence. Even there she couldn't even get a break !  
“唱歌真好。唱歌能丰富灵魂。这是莉莉姆所创造的文明的最高成就。”唱歌的人说道。这句神秘的话将她从怀旧的回忆中拉回。即便在那里，她也无法得到片刻安宁！

"I'm not in the mood to talk to strangers. Get lost !" She tried to sound aggressive, she only managed to sound crestfallen.  
“我没心情和陌生人说话。走开！”她试图显得咄咄逼人，却只流露出沮丧之情。

"I understand. In that case, I am Kaworu, Kaworu Nagisa. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Asuka Langley Soryu." He replied with a smile.  
"我明白了。那么，我是渚薰，渚薰。很高兴终于见到你，惣流·明日香·兰格雷。" 他微笑着回答。

"Oh. So you're the impostor ! And I thought this day couldn't get any better." She answered sardonically.  
"哦。原来你是冒牌货！我还以为今天不会更精彩了呢。" 她讽刺地回答。

"I am part of the design. Just like you." Kaworu answered, unfazed by his interlocutor's tone.  
"我是设计的一部分，就像你一样。" 渚薰回答，对他的对话者的语气毫不在意。

"Yeah well, don't get too comfortable ! Unit 02 is mine. And I won't let you replace me. Or anyone else for that matter." Asuka said, annoyed by Kaworu's lack of reactions to her sarcasms. He reminded her of Rei in that moment  
“哼，别太得意了！二号机是我的。我不会让你取代我，或者任何人。”明日香对渚薰对她讽刺的无动于衷感到恼火。那一刻，他让她想起了绫波。

"I never intended to replace you. Not that I would have had anything to say in the matter." His tone was kind, almost friendly. Despite herself, Asuka felt her resentment towards the Fifth Child ebb away little by little.  
“我从没想过要取代你。即便我有发言权，也不会那样做。”他的语气温和，近乎友好。尽管如此，明日香对第五适格者的怨恨还是一点点消退了。

"Maybe. That being said, I know that some people want me out, and let me tell you, I will not give up my Eva without a fight." After all, she felt like Unit 02 was all she had left. The last thing she could hold on to.  
“也许吧。不过，我知道有些人想让我离开，我告诉你，我不会不战而退地放弃我的 Eva。”毕竟，她觉得二号机是她仅剩的一切，是她唯一能抓住的东西。

"Why ?" He asked, still smiling softly.  
"为什么？" 他问道，依旧温柔地微笑着。

"What do you mean why ?" She retorted harshly.  
"你什么意思，为什么？" 她尖锐地反驳道。

"Why do you want to keep on piloting if it brings you this much pain ?" He wasn't smiling anymore. He could see how despondent she was, so the answer genuinely interested him. He waited for several seconds, studying the Second Child's face. She was struggling to try and hide her pain. She knew that this question was pertinent. She had asked it herself a lot lately. She was starting to feel that giving up was not such a bad option anymore. When she failed to answer, he pressed on. "Moreover, why do you want to keep on piloting now that Shinji Ikari cannot pilot anymore ?"  
"既然驾驶给你带来这么多痛苦，为什么你还想继续驾驶？" 他不再微笑，能看出她有多么沮丧，所以这个答案真正引起了他的兴趣。他等待了几秒钟，仔细观察着这位第二适格者的脸。她在努力掩饰自己的痛苦。她知道这个问题很关键。最近她自己也常常问这个问题。她开始觉得放弃并不是那么糟糕的选择。当她未能回答时，他继续追问："而且，既然碇真嗣不能再驾驶了，为什么你还想继续驾驶？"

He shouldn't have asked this question. "Don't you dare talk about Shinji !" Reacting like this was stupid and she realized it as soon as she said it. She just couldn't control herself.  
他不该问这个问题的。“你敢提真嗣试试！”她这样反应既愚蠢，又在她话一出口就意识到了。她就是控制不住自己。

"You chose to open your heart to him despite knowing what could happen." He smiled again. She could have sworn he looked proud of her, which didn't make any sense in her mind.  
“尽管知道可能发生什么，你还是选择向他敞开心扉。”他又笑了。她几乎可以发誓，他看起来为她感到骄傲，这在她的脑海中毫无道理。

Having this stranger read her so well was particularly unsettling to her. This boy seemed to know everything about her and Shinji. "Incredible." She exclaimed, amazed. "Even the New Fish knows about us ! Is it too much to ask for some privacy ?"  
被这个陌生人如此透彻地看穿，让她感到特别不安。这个男孩似乎对她和真嗣的一切了如指掌。“难以置信。”她惊叹道，“连新来的都知道我们的事！就不能给我们留点隐私吗？”

Again, Kaworu ignored Asuka's caustic remark and continued. "It is very courageous of you. If you don't get close to others, you'll never be betrayed and you'll never hurt each other. But you'll also never be able to forget your loneliness. Humans can never banish their loneliness for good, because being human means being alone. However, you chose to take the risk of getting hurt in order not to feel lonely anymore. This is admirable of you." He paused, looking in the Second Child's eyes. "You may act aggressive towards me, but it is obvious that you are upset."  
又一次，渚薰无视了明日香尖刻的评论，继续说道：“你非常勇敢。如果你不接近他人，你就永远不会被背叛，也不会彼此伤害。但你也将永远无法忘记你的孤独。人类永远无法彻底驱散孤独，因为成为人类就意味着孤独。然而，你选择冒着受伤的风险，不再感到孤独。这令人钦佩。”他停顿了一下，凝视着第二适格者的眼睛。“你可能对我表现出攻击性，但显然你很难过。”

"Of course I am upset !" Asuka shouted, her eyes brimming with tears. She had just about enough of Kaworu's shrewdness.  
“我当然难过！”明日香喊道，眼中噙满泪水。她已经受够了渚薰的敏锐洞察。

"Then maybe I was born so that I would meet you..." He was still smiling. Which was starting to get on Asuka's nerves. She was about to berate him because of his cheap flirting attempt when he continued. "So I could tell you not to lose hope. Things will get better... And more importantly, that you deserve to be loved."  
“那么也许我出生就是为了遇见你……”他依然微笑着。这让明日香开始感到烦躁。她正要因为他轻浮的调情而斥责他，他却继续说道：“所以我可以告诉你不要失去希望。事情会变得更好……更重要的是，你值得被爱。”

Asuka stared at him in astonishment. She was trying to parse what he had just said, and moreover how she was supposed to react. Her instinct was telling her to punch him in the throat so he wouldn't be able to say stupid things like this anymore. She then realized she had been staring at him for far too long so she decided to just answer him. " Sure. Whatever." This conversation had been long enough already, and she wasn't in control. He had manipulated her into saying things she didn't want to say so easily that she was scared it would continue if she were to keep talking with him. "You're finished ?" She tried to sound jaded.  
明日香惊讶地盯着他。她试图理解他刚刚说的话，以及她应该如何反应。她的本能告诉她应该一拳打在他的喉咙上，这样他就不能再说出这种愚蠢的话了。随后她意识到自己盯着他看的时间太长了，于是决定简单回应他。"当然，随便。"这场对话已经够长了，而且她不在掌控之中。他轻易地操纵她说了一些她不想说的话，这让她害怕如果继续和他交谈，这种情况会持续下去。"你完了吗？"她试图显得冷漠。

"I'd like to talk more with you."  
"我想和你多聊聊。"

"No thanks." She cut him sternly before turning on her heels. Maybe a bit too quickly. She didn't care. This discussion had been far too upsetting. "Bye." She mumbled before walking away. He kept looking at her with a smile on his face until she disappeared from his sight.  
"不了，谢谢。"她严厉地打断他，然后转身就走。也许有点太快了。她不在乎。这次讨论太让人心烦了。"再见。"她咕哝着走开。他一直微笑着看着她，直到她从他的视线中消失。

.

"What a load of crap !" She said a little too loud right next to a middle aged man and her young son. She stared the father down until he looked away. If he had a problem with her, she was listening ! 'I deserve to be loved. Yeah. Right.' She had been wandering the streets of Tokyo 3 for hours. 'If that were the case, maybe the ones supposed to love me wouldn't abandon me one after the other !'. She didn't know where to go. She didn't want to see anyone.  
“真是胡说八道！”她对着一位中年男子和她的小儿子大声说道，声音略显刺耳。她盯着那位父亲，直到他移开目光。如果他对她有意见，她倒是愿意倾听！“我值得被爱。是啊，没错。”她在第三东京市的街道上徘徊了数小时。“如果真是那样，也许那些本该爱我的人就不会一个接一个地抛弃我了！”她不知道该去哪里。她不想见任何人。

In truth, all she wanted at the moment was to lay down on the asphalt and let herself die. This day had been far too harrowing for the young girl. She took a deep breath for the umpteenth time since her meeting with Kaworu to keep the tears at bay. She went to the first clothing shop she found. Section 2 was probably following her right now, so she had to shake them off. She thus bought a big black hooded sweatshirt that she used to cover her hair. She left the store at the same time as a group of people and disappeared into the crowd. The last thing she wanted was to be brought back to the apartment. Even if a part of her wanted to go back to her Shinji. The thing was that wasn't a Shinji to go back to anymore in her mind.  
实际上，此刻她唯一想做的就是躺在柏油路上，任由自己死去。这一天对这位年轻女孩来说太过煎熬。自从与薰见面后，她不知第几次深呼吸，试图抑制泪水。她走进了第一家服装店。第二支部很可能正在跟踪她，所以她必须甩掉他们。于是她买了一件黑色的大号连帽运动衫，用来遮住头发。她与一群人同时离开商店，消失在人群中。她最不想的就是被带回公寓。尽管她内心的一部分想要回到真嗣身边。但问题是，在她心中，那个真嗣已经不复存在了。

She felt like a fugitive, despite having no intention of leaving Tokyo 3. She decided to go to one of the ruined parts of the city, where she was sure no one would be. She eventually stumbled across a house which was less ruined than the others. That meant that its roof was still sufficiently intact. This would have to do for the time being.  
她感觉自己像个逃犯，尽管并无离开第三新东京市的打算。她决定前往城市中损毁严重的区域之一，那里她确信无人会去。最终，她偶然发现了一栋比其他房屋破坏程度较轻的房子。这意味着它的屋顶还算完好。暂时只能将就了。

Ritsuko was sitting in her office. The ashtray on her desk was full of smoked cigarettes. It was late in the evening. She didn't bother going home anymore. There was no point."I see, so she passed away." She did her best to hide her annoyance. She still had a lot of work to do. "Yes, probably, even cats eventually reach the end of their lives." 'That's what happens.' She thought cynically. She crossed her legs. She just wanted this phone call to end. "Don't cry anymore, Grandma." She couldn't just hang up. She was a poor, lonely old woman. Much like herself. "I will. When I get some time, I'll come home for a bit. I haven't visited Mother's grave in three years either." She wouldn't miss her granddaughter for long. The end was approaching quickly now. There was no point in getting sentimental now. She did her best to convince herself. "I'll call you next time. Okay, I'm hanging up now."  
Ritsuko 坐在她的办公室里，桌上的烟灰缸堆满了烟蒂。夜已深沉，她不再费心回家，毫无意义。“我明白了，她去世了。”她尽力掩饰自己的烦躁，还有许多工作待完成。“是的，或许，连猫的寿命也有尽头。”她愤世嫉俗地想。她跷起二郎腿，只盼这通电话快些结束。“别再哭了，奶奶。”她不能就这样挂断，那是个可怜孤独的老人，与她自己何其相似。“我会回去的，等我有空时，会回家看看。我也已经三年没去母亲墓前了。”她不会太久地思念孙女，终点正迅速逼近，此刻多愁善感毫无意义。她竭力说服自己。“下次再聊，好了，我要挂电话了。”

"So, she died." She looked to the little cat figurines on her desk. The only personal effects in the room. 'Soon, nothing will matter.' Or so she tried to convince herself. She kept looking wistfully at the two porcelain cats. She loved her cats. Losing one, even due to old age, was a little tragedy in the grand scheme of things, but a tragedy nonetheless.  
"所以，她去世了。" 她望向桌上的小猫摆件，那是房间里仅有的个人物品。'很快，一切都不再重要。' 或者她试图这样说服自己。她一直深情地凝视着那对瓷猫。她深爱着她的猫。失去一只，即便是因为年老，在宏大的事物中也算是一场小小的悲剧，但悲剧终究是悲剧。

Her musings were interrupted by her office door opening suddenly, almost violently. There was only one person who usually opened it like this. "Misato. Can I help you with something ?" Since the 12th Angel, the two women barely spoke to each other anymore. Nobody could have told they used to be close friends with their attitude towards the other.  
她的沉思被办公室门突然且几乎猛烈地打开所打断。通常这样开门的人只有一个。"美里。有什么我能帮忙的吗？" 自从第 12 使徒事件后，这两位女性几乎不再交谈。没有人能从她们对待对方的态度中看出她们曾经是亲密的朋友。

"Do you know if Section 2 has found Asuka ?"  
"你知道第二分部找到明日香了吗？"

Ritsuko raised an eyebrow at the question. If she wanted to know that, she could have asked Section 2 directly. She didn't even know that the Second Child had been missing. She had been so deep in the bowels of NERV for so long that she didn't even know what was happening outside of her office or the Command Center. "How would I know ?" She answered tiredly. "Is it really why you came to see me ?"  
律子对这个问题的反应是挑了挑眉。如果她想知道，完全可以直接问第二课。她甚至不知道二号适格者已经失踪了。她在 NERV 深处待得太久，以至于对办公室和指挥中心之外的事情一无所知。“我怎么会知道？”她疲惫地回答，“你来找我，真的只是为了这个吗？”

Misato was a little surprised at her friend's insight. "I miss my friend." She decided to be straightforward. She was all alone now and she desperately needed to know that she could still count on someone. "Everything is falling apart around us." She declared woefully.  
美里对朋友的洞察力感到有些惊讶。“我想念我的朋友。”她决定直截了当。现在她孤身一人，迫切需要知道还有人可以依靠。“我们周围的一切都在崩溃。”她悲伤地宣布。

"This is about Shinji ?" She asked with a bit of annoyance. She had managed to avoid an uncomfortable conversation just a few minutes earlier only to have an other one forced upon her. The woman inside her was almost beginning to believe in karma.  
“这是关于真嗣的吗？”她带着一丝不悦问道。她刚刚设法避免了一场尴尬的对话，结果又被迫面对另一场。她内心深处几乎开始相信因果报应了。

"If only it were just about him..." She answered, staring vacantly into space. Her eyes suddenly darted back to her friend. "Can you believe him though !?" She continued with renewed anger. "He left his own son suffer through this ! I know I shouldn't be surprised anymore but he didn't even come see him in the hospital !"  
"要是只关乎他就好了..." 她回答道，眼神空洞地凝视着远方。突然，她的目光又回到了朋友身上。"你能相信他吗？！" 她带着新生的怒气继续说道，"他让自己的亲生儿子承受这一切！我知道我不该再感到惊讶，但他甚至没来医院看他一眼！"

'I know Misato. I was there the whole time.' She wasn't proud of how her mind was working at the moment. Her oldest friend just barged in her office with an olive branch. The least she could do was humor her. Moreover, she needed a friend too. It didn't matter how close the end was, she didn't want to feel this loneliness. Even the Commander was getting more and more distant. "You know, the Commander is a busy man."  
'我知道，美里。我一直都在那里。' 她并不为自己的心境感到自豪。她最老的朋友突然带着橄榄枝闯进她的办公室，她至少应该迁就一下。而且，她也确实需要一个朋友。无论结局多么临近，她都不想再感受这种孤独。甚至连指挥官也变得越来越疏远。"你知道的，指挥官是个大忙人。"

"That's bullshit and you know it Rits ! This man doesn't even love his own son !" She barked back. She needed to vent out her frustration and anger. "I'm pretty sure he's incapable of loving anyone or anything !"  
"那是胡说八道，你也知道，律子！这个人连自己的儿子都不爱！" 她厉声反驳。她需要发泄自己的沮丧和愤怒。"我敢肯定，他根本无法爱任何人或任何事物！"

Despite her anger, the woman's reasoning was quite logical. It made Ritsuko uncomfortable thinking about it. It made sense. That's what she didn't like about it, so she decided it was time to end this conversation. "We should go out for a drink sometime. Soon." She added, once again absorbed in her own thoughts.  
尽管愤怒，女人的推理却相当合乎逻辑。这让律子感到不安，思考起来。这很有道理。正是这一点让她不喜欢，于是她决定是时候结束这场对话了。“我们应该找个时间出去喝一杯。很快。”她补充道，再次沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"Sure thing ! I'll call you ! Thanks Rits !" The Major said almost cheerfully, as if it had been a pleasant chat with her friend. She had been able to talk. That was enough for her.  
“当然可以！我会给你打电话的！谢谢你，律子！”玛丽少校几乎愉快地说道，仿佛这是一次与朋友的愉快聊天。她已经能够倾诉了。这对她来说已经足够了。

"It is impossible for us to recover the Lance of Longinus." The distorted voice of one of SEELE's Committee stated, obviously not pleased about the situation.  
“我们不可能找回朗基努斯之枪。”SEELE 委员会中一个扭曲的声音说道，显然对这种情况感到不满。

"Why did you use it ?" A second voice asked.  
“你为什么使用了它？”另一个声音问道。

"We still do not have the planned number of the Eva Series." And a third remarked. This debriefing was more of a tribunal than anything else.  
“我们还没有达到计划中的 Eva 系列数量。”第三个人评论道。这次汇报更像是一场审判，而非其他。

"I made destroying the Angel my first priority. It was an unavoidable situation." Gendo didn't care about this masquerade. The Lance had been used. There was no point crying over spilled milk. Besides, they should be aware that Unit 01 was of essential importance to their plan as a contingency. He of course didn't feel the need to mention his own plan.  
“我将摧毁使徒作为首要任务。那是一个无法避免的情况。”碇源堂并不在乎这场伪装。朗基努斯之枪已经被使用，覆水难收。此外，他们应该明白初号机作为应急计划的重要性。当然，他没必要提及自己的计划。

"Unavoidable, was it ? You should make your excuses more convincing than that. Your recent actions have become intolerable." The first voice answered in an attempt to intimidate the Supreme Commander of NERV. Thankfully for him, the phone on his desk rang.  
"不可避免，是吗？你的借口应该比这更有说服力。你最近的行为已经到了无法容忍的地步。" 第一个声音试图恐吓 NERV 最高指挥官。幸运的是，他桌上的电话响了。

"Fuyutsuki, we're in the middle of deliberations here... All right." He hung up. "An Angel in currently drawing near. Let us continue this at another time." This was good news for the Commander. He didn't have time for such childish behavior. And technically, neither did the Old Men.  
"副司令，我们正在讨论中……好吧。" 他挂了电话。"一个使徒正在逼近。我们改天再继续这个话题。" 这对指挥官来说是好消息。他没有时间处理这种幼稚的行为。从技术上讲，那些老头子们也没有时间。

"If your seat is still waiting for you, that is." The second voice added, again in a vain attempt to intimidate Gendo Ikari.  
"如果你的位置还在等着你，那就是了。" 第二个声音补充道，再次徒劳地试图恐吓碇源堂。

"Ikari... Does he intend to betray SEELE ?" Kiel asked right after Gendo had left the meeting. His tone was mostly rhetorical. Mixed with disbelief.  
"碇...他打算背叛 Seele 吗？" 基尔在源渡离开会议后立即问道。他的语气多半是反问，夹杂着难以置信。

很糟糕！再加上明日香和川流之间的讨论，写起来非常麻烦。

最糟糕的是，比如说律子和美里的部分 
之后就很自然地出现了。
我不会放弃这个 
我希望你们知道这一点。就像我之前说的，我已经计划好了大部分内容。
我想把它进行到底。

更清楚了。
我想说的是，我非常感谢你们给我的反馈、PM 
反馈、PM、评论等等。它们就像在 
有时，我需要这样的感觉！
最后一点，我没有像重读其他章节那样重读这一章，所以如果有比平时更多的错误，请多多包涵！
