Asuka and Mari are left alone in Misato's apartment one Saturday night.  
某个周六晚上，明日香和玛丽被独自留在美里公寓里。

---

Asuka really hated Saturdays. They usually meant watching Misato go on a "mature" date with Kaji, only to return after midnight or call Asuka to let her know she would be spending the night in the man's apartment. _What a disgusting behavior for an adult_, she would think after hanging up the phone. _I'll never be like that, not like her_, she continued on, determined to ignore the fact that, some day, she'll succumb to those adult matters too. And yet, it was becoming harder and harder to fight those bodily urges that made puberty hell for people like her, for the kind that didn't want to give in. Especially when she slowly found out that the impulses were not limited to boys alone.  
明日香真的很讨厌星期六。这通常意味着要看着美里和加持去进行所谓的“成熟”约会，结果要么是午夜后才回来，要么就是打电话给明日香，告诉她自己要在加持的公寓过夜。挂断电话后，她会想，一个成年人做出这种行为真是令人作呕。我绝不会变成那样，不像她，她继续想着，决心忽视这样一个事实：总有一天，她也会屈服于这些成人事务。然而，那些让青春期对她这样不愿屈服的人来说如同地狱般的生理冲动，却变得越来越难以抵抗。尤其是当她慢慢发现，这些冲动并不仅限于对男生的渴望时。

_Damn it all_. 该死。

"What did Misato say?" A voice asked from the living room. It was joyful and had a strange rhythm to it, but its slight huskiness was unmistakeable.  
"美里说了什么？" 客厅里传来一个声音，欢快而有节奏，但那略带沙哑的嗓音却不容错辨。

Saturdays really weren't that bad. The truly worst part of it all was that girl, Mari Illustrious Makinami. Talk about egotistical. Asuka wondered if all British people were as weird, uninhibited, and outright defiant of the concept of personal space as Mari was. Living with Shinji had been an annoying ordeal. But at least he followed orders, was docile, and was a good cook.  
星期六其实也没那么糟糕。最糟糕的部分就是那个女孩，真希波·真理·玛丽娜美。真是自大。明日香怀疑是不是所有英国人都像真希波那样古怪、放肆，完全无视个人空间的概念。和真嗣住在一起已经够烦人的了。但至少他听从命令，温顺，而且厨艺不错。

"Four-eyes" was more exhausting to deal with. She always had something to say back, something to question the German's authority. She always wanted to get close, by going in for a hug, a cuddle, a caress to the cheek, _anything_ . All the while putting a smug grin to complement those stupid looking glasses. The girl was blind as a bat. And couldn't cook if her own life depended on it.  
“四眼”更让人头疼。她总有话回怼，总有办法质疑德国人的权威。她总是想方设法靠近，拥抱、依偎、轻抚脸颊，无所不用其极。同时还不忘配上那副傻气眼镜下的得意笑容。这女孩简直是个瞎子。而且要是她自己的命悬一线，她也绝对不会做饭。

So it was by Asuka's divine fate that Misato officially adopted Mari shortly after the foreign girl joined NERV. Shinjis room was now Mari's, but after three months Asuka still didn't know what it looked like. Just like the inside of Mari's head. The brunette seemed so happy all the time with who she was and what she did and how she did it that it genuinely intrigued her. Asuka often asked herself if Mari could be capable of feeling other sentiments, like sadness, anger, or contempt. What a curious creature, this Mari.  
于是，在那个外国女孩加入 NERV 后不久，命运之神似乎眷顾了明日香，美里正式收养了真希波。真希波的房间曾是真嗣的，但三个月过去了，明日香仍然不知道它长什么样。就像真希波的内心世界一样神秘。这位棕发女孩似乎总是那么快乐，无论她是谁，她在做什么，以及她如何做，这一切都真正引起了她的好奇。明日香常常自问，真希波是否能感受到其他情感，比如悲伤、愤怒或蔑视。这个真希波，真是个奇妙的生物。

"She won't be coming tonight, as usual". Asuka said after letting out a weary sigh.  
“她今晚不会来了，一如既往。”明日香叹了口气说道。

She made her way from the kitchen to the living room and placed the phone back in its base. Mari was slumped on the floor with her head resting on the sofas center, eating a generous portion of a strange ice cream mix from an Eva-08 shaped cup. Something with pralines in it. The girls curious turquoise eyes looked up at her roommate, who was retreating to her room.  
她从厨房走向客厅，将电话放回底座。玛丽瘫坐在地板上，头靠在沙发中央，正从一个 EVA-08 形状的杯子里大口吃着一种奇怪的冰淇淋混合物，里面似乎有果仁糖。女孩好奇的蓝绿色眼睛抬头看着她的室友，对方正要回房间。

"Hey, where are you going? Skins is about to start!" Mari said encouragingly. It really was a stupid show. To the highly educated Asuka it was nothing more than a bunch of pubescent kids trying to get what a bunch of pubescent kids need: insignificant sex and drugs. But somehow, with the passage of time, it became bearable. Although, why Asuka watched it in the first place was to enjoy the little company she had, even if it was with Mari.  
“嘿，你要去哪儿？《皮囊》就要开始了！”玛丽鼓励地说道。这真是一部愚蠢的剧。对于受过高等教育的明日香来说，不过是一群青春期的孩子在试图得到他们需要的东西：无关紧要的性爱和毒品。但随着时间的推移，这部剧变得可以忍受了。尽管如此，明日香最初看它的原因是为了享受她仅有的一点陪伴，哪怕对方是玛丽。

"I'm tired four eyes, I'm going to sleep."  
“我累了，四眼，我要去睡觉。”

"What? But its only seven-thirty. Commooon, you told me you wanted to watch it tonight with me! Just a little while?" Mari insisted with sad puppy eyes.  
“什么？但才七点半啊。拜托，你不是说今晚想和我一起看的吗！就一会儿嘛？”玛丽坚持着，眼神像可怜的小狗一样。

_She acts just like a child_.  
她表现得就像个孩子。

Asuka let go another tired breath and walked over to the dark sofa that Kaji had bought for them or, more accurately, for Misato, as a congratulations on her promotion.  
明日香又叹了口气，疲惫地走向那张卡吉买给他们的——更准确地说，是买给美里——作为她晋升祝贺的黑色沙发。

"Fine." “好吧。”

Asuka sat down on the somewhat cold leather and laid back, letting the comfortable material adjust to her form. _Ah, this feels nice_, Asuka thought as her body started to relax. Months have passed since the Eva-03 incident, but the recovery was still slow. During the first month Asuka completely lost her desire to eat, forcing the doctors to feed her via IV, and she couldn't go near an Eva, even her precious Unit 02, without feeling her insides wanting to come out. Although her condition had improved somewhat, the frequent fatigue and anxiety attacks were really taking a toll on Asuka as well as on her performance. She knew the higher ups at NERV were hectic for a replacement, and the mere idea of it stirred a cold sting inside her chest. The thought of being replaced, being forgotten, disposed of, insignificant.  
明日香坐在略显冰冷的皮革上，向后一靠，让舒适的材质适应她的身形。啊，这种感觉真好，明日香心想，随着身体开始放松。自从 Eva-03 事件以来已经过去了几个月，但恢复依然缓慢。在第一个月里，明日香完全失去了进食的欲望，迫使医生通过静脉注射来喂养她，而且她无法靠近任何 Eva，即使是她珍爱的二号机，也会让她感到内脏想要吐出来。尽管她的状况有所改善，但频繁的疲劳和焦虑发作确实对她以及她的表现造成了影响。她知道 NERV 的高层正在急切地寻找替代者，这个想法在她胸中激起了一阵冰冷的刺痛。被替代、被遗忘、被抛弃、变得无足轻重。

_Stop it Asuka. Don't.  别这样，明日香。不要。_

Asuka's face furrowed as she tried to silence the thoughts, but it smoothed once more as she felt a slight heat in her leg. _Albeit on_ her leg was more accurate. _What the-_ She looked down in confusion only to see a wave of familiar dark brown hair. It was Mari.  
明日香的脸皱了起来，试图压制那些思绪，但当她感到腿上传来一丝热度时，表情又恢复了平静。更准确地说，是在她的腿上。什么情况——她困惑地低头一看，只见一缕熟悉的深棕色头发。是真希波。

As usual, the girl had no trouble pushing the boundaries of proximity with Asuka, despite their short time knowing each other. Resting on her leg, her lap, her shoulder when sharing popcorn, it wouldn't end for Asuka. At first she could barely withstand it, lashing out at the brunette to get her own damn space. Asuka Langley Shikinami was nobody's pillow. But as of recently, she didn't care what Mari did, maybe it was the tiredness of everything that's happened to her. Or maybe she just realized how incredibly nice it felt to be _wanted_. Frankly, Asuka never understood how Mari didn't have a problem asking for what she wanted so bluntly,  
一如既往，尽管相识时间不长，这个女孩毫不费力地突破了与明日香之间的亲密界限。靠在她的腿上，坐在她的膝头，分享爆米花时倚在她的肩上，对明日香来说，这一切似乎永无止境。起初她几乎无法忍受，对那位棕发女孩大发脾气，要求她给自己留点空间。惣流·明日香·兰格雷可不是谁的枕头。但最近，她对真希波的行为不再介意，也许是因为经历了太多事情而感到疲惫。或者她只是意识到被需要的感觉是多么美妙。坦白说，明日香一直不明白真希波怎么能如此直白地表达自己的需求，而毫不感到困扰。

"Hey Asuka, wanna go look at pets with me?"  
“嘿，明日香，想和我一起去看看宠物吗？”

"Try this one on! It'll make you look like a hot biker chick."  
"试试这件！穿上它你会看起来像个火辣的摩托车女孩。"

"Here, let me help you with the bandages."  
"来，我帮你缠绷带。"

"Want to hang out after the synch tests? I'm buying your favorite chocolates :3"  
"同步测试后想一起玩吗？我请你吃你最喜欢的巧克力 :3"

"I'm having trouble sleeping, can I sleep with you?"  
“我睡不着，能和你一起睡吗？”

Asuka couldn't do that, not anymore at least. With the death of her mother, life turned into them vs her, and after years of forceful adulthood, without the help of a single soul, how exactly does one learn to need someone, to want someone again? Asuka, completely guided by her pride, lost the ability to reach out. Hence, no matter how much time they spent together, Maris attention and detail towards her always felt alien; although very deep down, it was bliss. She never knew friendship could make her feel so special, so much more than any piloting praise.  
对于明日香来说，她已经无法再那样做了，至少现在不行。自从母亲去世后，生活变成了她们与她之间的对抗，经过多年被迫的成年生活，没有任何人帮助，一个人究竟该如何学会需要别人，再次渴望别人呢？明日香，完全被她的骄傲所引导，失去了求助的能力。因此，无论他们在一起度过了多少时间，玛丽对她的关注和细节总是让她感到陌生；尽管在内心深处，这是一种幸福。她从未意识到友谊能让她感到如此特别，远超过任何飞行表扬。

For a split second, Asuka felt the strange urge to graze her hand through Mari's hair. The British would do that a lot to Asuka, whether it was solicited or not, but the soothing effect was indescribable. Reciprocating the feeling felt like the correct thing to do. That's what friends do, right? Asukas fingertips reached out towards Mari, almost having the sensation of smooth hair underneath them, when they decided to stop.  
有那么一瞬间，明日香感到一种奇怪的冲动，想要用手轻抚玛丽的头发。英国人经常这样做，无论是被请求还是未经请求，但那种舒缓的效果难以言表。回应这种感觉似乎是正确的事情。这就是朋友之间会做的，对吧？明日香的手指伸向玛丽，几乎能感受到下面顺滑的头发，但它们最终停了下来。

The tv show had gone ahead without Asuka, and when she snapped out of her daze all she could make sense of was one of the protagonists wanting to make a party for his shy friend to loose his virginity.  
电视节目在没有明日香的情况下继续进行，当她从恍惚中回过神来时，她只能理解到其中一个主角想要为他的害羞朋友举办派对，以便让他失去童贞。

_God this is stupid, how can Mari keep watching this crap?  
天哪，这太蠢了，真希波怎么能一直看这种垃圾？  
_

Just as two kids were about to kiss, the screen turned pitch black.  
就在两个孩子即将接吻时，屏幕突然变得漆黑一片。

"What happened? Weren't you dying to watch that stupid show?"  
"发生了什么？你不是一直很想看那部无聊的剧吗？"

Mari turned her head to face Asuka, squishing the girls thigh beneath her chin in a fit of fake frustration. "Yeah, but whats the point if you're not enjoying it?"  
玛丽转过头面对明日香，假装生气地把下巴压在女孩的大腿上。“是啊，但如果你不享受，那还有什么意义呢？”

"What? I'm enjoying it." "什么？我很享受啊。"

Mari twisted her body and propped herself on the sofa with an arm on each side of Asuka's hips. "No you're not, I could tell from a mile away" she refuted with one of her signature smirks, edging closer to the second child.  
玛丽扭动身体，双臂撑在明日香臀部的两侧，将自己支在沙发上。“不，你不是，我从一英里外就能看出来。”她带着标志性的坏笑反驳道，逐渐靠近第二适格者。

_She's so close._ Asuka felt the leather give in under Mari's weight. She buried herself deeper into the sofa in an attempt to create distance between them, but she couldn't stop a blush from forming on her cheeks.  
她靠得太近了。明日香感觉到皮革在玛丽的重量下凹陷。她将自己更深地埋进沙发，试图拉开与对方的距离，但无法阻止脸颊上泛起红晕。

"I AM enjoying it," Asuka spat back. Her temper was already beginning to heat up. She absolutely hated it when Mari presumptuously stated what she was feeling because, in most cases, she was right. A smug grin formed on Mari's lips as she noticed how the slight tinge on her partners face matched her reddish hair.  
“我确实在享受，”明日香回呛道。她的脾气已经开始升温。她绝对讨厌玛丽自以为是地断定她的感受，因为大多数情况下，她都是对的。玛丽注意到对方脸上微妙的红色与她红色的头发相映成趣，嘴角勾起一抹得意的笑。

"You're aroused so easily it's almost cute, Asuka."  
"你这么容易兴奋，简直有点可爱，明日香。"

_A-aroused easily!? That's it.  
容、容易兴奋！？够了。_

"Yeah, coming from the person who kissed three guys on the Christmas party. Spells more like 'whore' to me." The memory was short but concise. Mari thought that hiding in a dark corner of the room would be enough to hide her intentions, but not to Asuka's eyes. She remembered the way that loathsome NERV technician kissed her wildly, and the way his hands roamed over her shirt, begging for so much more. It was all a mess of moving shadows and barely audible whispers. But most of all she remembers the disgust she felt, alongside all that unwelcome sadness that leaked from her heart. Was she not worthy of that kind of attention?  
"是啊，从那个在圣诞派对上亲了三个男人的家伙嘴里说出来。对我来说更像是在说‘荡妇’。" 那段记忆虽短暂却清晰。真希想躲在房间的暗角就能隐藏自己的意图，但在明日香眼里却无所遁形。她记得那个可恶的 NERV 技术员是如何狂热地吻她，他的手是如何在她衬衫上游走，渴望更多。一切都混乱不堪，影子交错，低语几乎听不清。但最重要的是，她记得那种厌恶感，以及从心底涌出的那些不受欢迎的悲伤。难道她不配得到那种关注吗？

Mari wasn't the least offended by Asuka's words. Instead, her typical grin continued to tease the German, "Say what you want, princess, at least I can control what I feel and when to feel it. You, on the other hand, don't know how to disguise the anticipation on your face."  
玛丽对明日香的话丝毫不感到冒犯。相反，她那惯常的笑容继续逗弄着这位德国女孩，"说什么都行，公主，至少我能控制自己的感受和何时感受。而你，另一方面，却不知道如何掩饰脸上的期待。"

"I don't have to take this from you. Get off." Asuka's said through clenched teeth.  
"我不必忍受你这样。走开。"明日香咬牙切齿地说道。"

"Oooh, did I strike a nerve?"  
"哦哦，我触到你的痛处了吗？"

"GET OFF." The girl was almost yelling now.  
"下来。" 女孩现在几乎是尖叫着。

"If you're so confident in your controls, princess, lets make a bet."  
"如果你对自己的控制这么有信心，公主，我们打个赌吧。"

"I don't have to prove anything to you, four-eyes."  
"我没什么需要向你证明的，四眼仔。"

"Turning down a challenge, Captain? Those who possess the skill have nothing to hide."  
"拒绝挑战，船长？有本事的人无需隐藏。"

It was at times like these that Asuka hated having such a willful pride. If she backed down now, God knows for how long Mari will annoy her about it, not to mention what sort of things she would say to the crew members. If something Asuka has learned from living with Mari, it was that the girl was capable of doing _anything_. If she won this stupid game of hers, it would all be over and her happy go lucky way of life would continue normally.  
每当这种时候，明日香就讨厌自己那任性的自尊心。如果现在退缩，天知道真希会烦她多久，更别提她会对船员们说什么。从和真希一起生活的经历中，明日香学到的是，这女孩什么都做得出来。如果她赢了这场愚蠢的游戏，一切就都结束了，她那无忧无虑的生活方式将继续正常进行。

"Fine, whats this 'bet' of yours?" Asuka finally said, crossing her arms.  
"好吧，你的'赌注'是什么？"明日香终于说道，双臂交叉。

"Well, its more of a game really. But it's easy, listen well..."  
"嗯，其实更像是个游戏。不过很简单，听好了..."

As Mari's words and gestures brought her ideas to life, Asuka's expression quickly changed from that of annoyance, to "oh my god, you can't be serious", to one with a thick mix of anxiety and anticipation. Silence filled the room after all was said an done. Asuka was now averting Mari's gaze by looking at the house phone, begging for it to ring and be Misato saying she's on her way home. But nothing ringed, and none of them moved. Mari's eyes had turned dark with mischief.  
随着玛丽的言语和手势将她的想法化为现实，明日香的神情迅速从恼怒转变为"天哪，你不是认真的吧"，再到混杂着焦虑与期待的复杂表情。一切说完做罢后，房间里陷入了沉默。明日香现在正避开玛丽的目光，盯着家用电话，期盼着它响起，是美里说她正在回家的路上。但电话没有响，她们也没有动。玛丽的眼中闪烁着恶作剧的光芒。

"What's it going to be, princess?" The German captain looked up with a slight frown on her face, hard with determination.  
"你打算怎么做，公主？"德国队长微微皱着眉头，脸上带着坚定的神情抬头看着。

"I accept." “我接受。”

Mari gave another trademark smile as she leaned in closer to raise herself from the sofa. She silently offered a small token to her partner, whom looked at it puzzlingly before slowly accepting it.  
玛丽再次露出她的标志性微笑，身体前倾从沙发上起身。她默默地向她的伙伴递出一个小物件，对方困惑地看着它，然后慢慢接过。

Mari gently enclosed her hand around Asuka's and lead the way to her room.  
玛丽轻轻地握住明日香的手，引领她走向自己的房间。

---
The bed caved in at Asuka's sides and Mari's scent hit her like a wave crashing against the shore. Their cheeks brushed and Mari tenderly laid a chaste kiss on an unsuspecting cheek. The German sighed at the musky and slightly sweet smell that came off her partner, marveled at the way it made her imagine a thick forest after a heavy rain had subsided. The smacking sound of lips made her open her eyes just as Mari moved back, a little slow and hesitant, she noticed, to her former position.  
床在明日香两侧凹陷，玛丽的气息如海浪般扑面而来。两人的脸颊轻触，玛丽温柔地在未曾预料的脸颊上落下一吻。德国少女对着伴侣身上散发出的微甜麝香叹息，惊叹于这气息让她联想到大雨过后的茂密森林。当玛丽缓缓退回原位时，那啵声让明日香睁开了眼，她注意到玛丽的动作略显迟缓与犹豫。

Asuka absentmindedly touched her cheek, as if she could prevent the gesture from leaving her skin; she couldn't remember the last time she had been kissed, if at all, in her long 17 years.  
明日香心不在焉地抚摸着自己的脸颊，仿佛这样就能阻止那触感从皮肤上消失；她记不清在漫长的十七年里，上一次被亲吻是什么时候，甚至是否有过这样的经历。

Affection was such a foreign act in their chaotic lives that handling it was an uncomfortable duty, a burden of both happiness and self-worth.  
在他们混乱的生活中，情感是一种如此陌生的行为，处理它成了一种令人不适的责任，既是幸福的负担，也是自我价值的重担。

Mari, resting her weight on one hand, peered at Asuka through her glasses with serious air despite her slight smile. "So, princess," she started, "Did I win? Did I set you ablaze?"  
真希波将重心靠在一只手上，透过眼镜认真地打量着明日香，尽管嘴角挂着一丝微笑。“那么，公主，”她开口道，“我赢了吗？我让你燃烧起来了吗？”

_Right, this stupid game_. Asuka thinks with a scoff and a glance to the side, in part to hide her blush. She wasn't that sensitive that a kiss to the cheek would speed up her body's rhythm. "No."  
好吧，这个愚蠢的游戏。明日香轻蔑地想着，同时瞥向一旁，部分是为了掩饰自己的脸红。她没那么敏感，一个脸颊上的吻不会加快她的心跳节奏。“不。”

"Nooo? Tsk, what a shame." A long finger fixes red-rimmed glasses to their rightful place. "I guess you'll have to claim your piece. What will it be?"  
“不——？啧，真可惜。”一根长长的手指将红框眼镜推回原位。“看来你得拿走你的那一份了。你想要什么？”

Her voice was full of sarcasm. Damned sarcasm. After all, it would not be like Mari at all to play her game, or anything for that matter, by the book. Asuka tried to remember the ridiculous rules.  
她的声音充满了讽刺。该死的讽刺。毕竟，真希波绝不会按部就班地玩她的游戏，或是做任何事情。明日香试图回忆那些荒谬的规则。

_The objective is simple, princess. We'll take turns finding out what part makes us tick. The one who finds it first, wins. But, for every wrong guess the opposite person gets to choose an item for the other to take off.  
目标很简单，公主。我们轮流找出让我们心动的部分。谁先找到，谁就赢。但每猜错一次，对方就可以选择一件物品让另一方脱掉。_

_What if there's nothing left to choose before someone wins?  
如果在有人赢之前已经没有东西可选了怎么办？_

_Well, Shikinami, you better guess correctly.  
那么，式波，你最好猜得准确些。_

The finality in Mari's statement made Asuka apprehensive. Suddenly a spotlight was cast upon her to take control over her partner, who was leaning to the side with a pair of glassy turquoise eyes expectantly looking at her. Asuka took a deep breath and slowly let it go,  
玛丽话语中的决绝让明日香感到不安。突然间，一束聚光灯打在她身上，要求她掌控她的搭档，那人正侧身倚靠着，一双朦胧的绿松石色眼睛期待地望着她。明日香深吸一口气，缓缓吐出，

"Take off your pigtail." “解开你的马尾辫。”

But Mari wasn't moving, wasn't being submissive like she promised; she just kept her piercing haze with a raised eyebrow and a smirk across her face.  
但玛丽并未动弹，也没有像她承诺的那样顺从；她只是保持着那锐利的目光，扬起眉毛，脸上挂着一丝得意的微笑。

"Take it off, then." "脱下来吧。"

"But you said-" "但你刚才说——"

"I _need_ you to take it off, Shikinami."  
"我需要你把它脱掉，式波。"

Asuka scowled at this change of strategy. She didn't like having the tables turned right in front of her. Her short lived sense of control was now gone. But the sooner they ended this, the sooner she could return to her sane life.  
明日香对这个策略的转变皱起了眉头。她不喜欢在眼前被翻盘的感觉。她那短暂的控制感已经消失了。但越早结束这一切，她就能越早回到正常的生活。

"Fine." “好吧。”

Asuka crawled across the bed, which was bent on giving in under her weight, until her knees knocked with Mari's. She leaned over the taller body, one hand reaching around a shoulder, the other doing the same, before fisting Mari's ponytail nervously. Her fingers cautiously pulled the hair band back. Mari's throat vibrated in a merry content that elongated into a most pleasurable sound.  
明日香爬过那张在她体重下屈服的床，直到膝盖碰到了真里的。她俯身在更高的身体上，一只手环绕着肩膀，另一只手同样如此，然后紧张地握住真里的马尾。她的手指小心翼翼地向后拉扯发圈。真里的喉咙发出愉悦的震动，声音拉长成一种极其悦耳的音调。

"Hmmn." Mari purred at the touch like a pleased cat, and Asuka found herself stopping for a few seconds, in complete shock, before hurriedly getting the band out of hair, setting it free, getting back to her place on the bed, and tossing it back at Mari. She didn't sign up for this, to have her body react to both boys _and_ girls.  
“嗯。”真里像一只满足的猫一样在触摸下发出呼噜声，明日香发现自己完全震惊地停了几秒钟，然后急忙把发圈从头发中取出，让它自由，回到床上的位置，并把它扔回给真里。她并没有签下这样的协议，让自己的身体对男孩和女孩都有反应。

It was something a teenager couldn't wrap her head around; it made her doubt her sanity, made her think that her wires were indeed being messed up from piloting the eva for so long, as Ritsuko often suggested. It made Asuka more careful at the shower rooms, to not look for too long in the wrong places.  
这对一个少女来说是无法理解的；它让她怀疑自己的理智，让她觉得自己的神经确实因为长时间驾驶 EVA 而混乱了，正如律子经常暗示的那样。这让明日香在浴室里更加小心，不去那些不该久留的地方。

Along the way she had gotten used to avoiding those little incidents, but then there was Mari. It wasn't so much the constant annoyance, the singing, and the clinginess that had Asuka fed up. It was the girls nimble fingers and the way her voice danced in that weird English way, it was her dark copper hair so out of place with those turquoise eyes; it was the way Mari smelled, breathed, looked at her through red glasses to ask if she was okay. Everything about her was so goddamn alluring.  
一路上她已经习惯了避开那些小插曲，但后来有了真希。让明日香受不了的并不是她不断的烦扰、唱歌和黏人。而是那女孩灵巧的手指和她那怪异的英语腔调，她那与碧眼格格不入的深铜色头发；还有真希的气味、呼吸，透过红色眼镜看着她，问她是否还好。她的一切都如此该死地吸引人。

And god forbid if she ever felt such indecent things towards her partner. Because it scared her to death; sex scared her. Because an eva she could control, from the slightest flexion of a fingertip to the heart beat. But she couldn't control her body, the thoughts it produced under the right circumstances. And she wasn't liking the way it was feeling right now.  
天哪，如果她对她的搭档产生了这种不正当的想法，那就糟了。因为这让她害怕得要命；性让她害怕。因为 EVA 她可以控制，从最细微的手指弯曲到心跳。但她无法控制自己的身体，无法控制在适当情况下产生的想法。而且她不喜欢现在这种感觉。

So she proceeded to start with something small and innocent. Like the back of the wrist. With the same precaution and gentleness as one would treat a newborn, Asuka grabbed Mari's hand and forearm to turn them upside down. The strings of tendons pulled and relaxed under rivers of veins, an unlikely appealing spot for the German. She brought the delicate patch of skin to her mouth and sliced it vertically with a wet tongue. A chuckle and nothing more was her reward. "That's a good start, princess."  
于是她从一个小而纯真的地方开始，比如手腕背面。带着对待新生儿般的谨慎与温柔，Asuka 抓住了 Mari 的手和前臂，将它们翻转过来。肌腱的线条在血管的河流下拉紧又放松，对德国人来说，这是一个出乎意料吸引人的部位。她将那片娇嫩的皮肤带到唇边，用湿润的舌头垂直划过。回应她的是一声轻笑，别无其他。“这是个不错的开始，公主。”

Asuka sat back, ashamed of her fruitless work, to which Mari gave a reassuring smile while she unclasped the girls lone bracelet.  
Asuka 沮丧地坐回原位，她的努力似乎毫无成果，而 Mari 则给了她一个安慰的微笑，同时解开了女孩唯一的手镯。

"My turn again." Mari started with a toothy smile, pressing down on Asuka's sternum with a finger. "Lay back a little."  
“轮到我了。”Mari 带着牙齿的微笑开始了，用手指按在 Asuka 的胸骨上。“稍微躺下一点。”

"What?" “什么？”

"You heard me." “你听见了。”

Mari could feel Asuka's frown boring a hole into her, so a little persuasion was deemed necessary. The brunette edged forward until she enclosed her partner with her body, straddling a pair of timid legs.  
玛丽能感觉到明日香皱眉的目光穿透了她，于是认为有必要稍加说服。这位棕发女孩向前挪动，直到用身体将她的搭档包围，跨坐在一双胆怯的腿上。

Asuka swallowed heavily as she looked up at the way Mari was angled so...dominantly. She had almost left by unnoticed the firm hand grabbing at her shoulder; the other came to rest underneath her jaw before it ever so slowly slid its way to her cheek. Her throat felt like it was filled with cement; the cold sting of trepidation made it painful to breathe. "What do you want from me?" Asuka's voice sounded weak and empty in the large room.  
明日香重重地咽了口唾沫，抬头看着玛丽那般...强势的姿态。她几乎没注意到那只紧紧抓住她肩膀的坚定手掌；另一只手则停留在她的下巴下方，然后缓缓滑向她的脸颊。她的喉咙仿佛被水泥填满；恐惧带来的冰冷刺痛让她呼吸困难。“你想从我这里得到什么？”明日香的声音在大房间里显得虚弱而空洞。

_Nothing_. Mari caressed the cheek underneath her thumb. Because there was nothing Asuka could offer to her, or at least was willing to offer. All Mari could do was gladfully accept what she was given, even if it was with insistent force.  
没什么。玛丽轻抚着她拇指下的脸颊。因为明日香无法给予她任何东西，或者至少是不愿意给予。玛丽所能做的，只是欣然接受她所得到的一切，哪怕是以一种执拗的方式。

She gave Asuka's shoulder a light push, and after a little hesitancy, the German rested her elbows on the bed.  
她轻轻推了推明日香的肩膀，经过片刻犹豫，德国女孩将双肘撑在了床上。

_There's nothing I could ask of you. Games are all we have_.  
我没什么可向你要求的。游戏就是我们的一切。

Mari shifted her position so that she could breath at the crook of Asuka's neck and reveled at the warmth it gave. Being submerged on cold LCL for so long makes one forget how nice the touch of another body feels like. It's almost nostalgic. But she keeps on her path, nuzzling the skin of a collarbone and lower still until she reaches the middle of Asuka's breasts.  
玛丽调整了姿势，以便能在明日香颈窝处呼吸，并沉醉于那里的温暖。长时间浸泡在冰冷的 LCL 中，让人几乎忘记了另一个身体的触感有多么美好。这几乎让人怀念。但她继续前行，轻蹭着锁骨的皮肤，再往下直至到达明日香胸部的中央。

She could hear the pulse underneath her quicken, felt a sense of satisfaction as her head rose in shorter intervals as Asuka's breath came out in nervous exhales. She angled her lips and gave a long, open, tender kiss. This was all she had to offer.  
她能听到身下的脉搏加速跳动，感受到一种满足感，因为她的头抬起的时间间隔越来越短，而明日香的呼吸也变得紧张而急促。她调整了唇的角度，给予了一个漫长、敞开、温柔的吻。这是她所能提供的全部。

"Ah...," Asuka let out in a low sigh, opening her eyes to an unfamiliar ceiling. Her lower back thrilled with the touch on her chest, with the way it was so thorough and _inviting,_ more so than any words Mari could ever use. In fact, Asuka suppressed a shocked gasp when a voice mumbled against her skin.  
“啊...”，明日香低声叹息，睁开眼睛望向一个陌生的天花板。她的下背部因胸前的触碰而兴奋，那种彻底而诱人的方式，远胜过玛丽可能使用的任何言语。事实上，当一个声音在她皮肤上低语时，明日香压抑了一声惊愕的喘息。

"Well?" “嗯？”

A short sigh, and another "No."  
一声短叹，接着又是“不行。”

Mari sat back and waited for Asuka to claim another piece of her.  
玛丽向后靠了靠，等待着明日香再次夺走她的一部分。

"Your shirt." The red head said as she quickly grabbed the hem of Mari's long sleeved blouse and pulled it over with ease, throwing it somewhere to her left. Something clicked inside of Asuka, a flame somewhere within startled awake at the sight in front of her.  
“你的衬衫。”红发女孩说着，迅速抓住玛丽长袖衬衫的下摆，轻松地将其扯过头顶，扔向左侧。某种情绪在明日香心中激荡，一团火焰在她内心深处被眼前的景象惊醒。

Her eyes wondered over Mari's well known ample chest, accentuated by a toned abdomen and tight strings of muscle in a pair of strong arms; she took a calming breath to ready her for whatever came next. She needed to end this quickly, and yet she wished to never reach the end of it.  
她的目光在玛丽熟悉的丰满胸部上游移，那紧致的腹部和结实的肌肉线条在强壮的双臂中显得格外突出；她深吸一口气，为接下来的一切做好准备。她需要迅速结束这一切，却又希望它永远不会结束。

Mari took a sharp breath as a shaky Asuka grabbed her neck with a firm, calloused hand to stable it for an open kiss, or rather, a hungry bite. It was gritty, all teeth and on the limit between pleasurable and painful. Asuka wasn't getting any signs of Mari breaking, so she nibbled along an imaginary line down the brunettes neck.  
玛丽倒吸一口凉气，颤抖的明日香用粗糙而有力的手抓住她的脖子，稳住她的头部，以便展开一场热烈的亲吻，或者说，是一次饥渴的啃咬。这感觉既粗犷又充满张力，介于愉悦与痛苦之间。明日香没有察觉到玛丽有任何退缩的迹象，于是她沿着一条想象中的线，轻轻啃咬着这位棕发女孩的脖子。

It was there she felt Mari's jaw tighten from a suppressed groan. Satisfied with her effort, Asuka licked her lips and eagerly examined Mari's expression, which was more on the side of hurt as the latter held the red skin she had left behind. Mari gave a feeble smile. "Very well done, princess, but that's a _no_."  
就在那里，她感觉到玛丽的下巴因压抑的呻吟而紧绷。对自己的努力感到满意，明日香舔了舔嘴唇，急切地审视着玛丽的表情，后者更多地表现出痛苦，因为她紧握着明日香留下的红肿皮肤。玛丽虚弱地笑了笑。"干得漂亮，公主，但这是不行的。"

From that point onward both girls knew what kind of game they had gotten themselves into. The rules had become null, their bodies determining the extent of how far they were willing to go to win.  
从那一刻起，两个女孩都知道她们卷入了一场什么样的游戏。规则已经失效，她们的身心决定了她们愿意走多远来赢得胜利。

Mari took off Asuka's blue collar and decided to reciprocate the violent advance. She formed a fist around Shikinamis ankle, holding her in place as she pulled about, and traced the inside of the Germans thigh with the tip of her fingers. A whimper reached her sharp ears, but she decided to not count it.  
玛丽摘下了明日香的蓝色项圈，决定回敬她的激烈进攻。她握住四叶的脚踝，固定住她的位置，同时用手指尖沿着德国人的大腿内侧划过。一声呜咽传入她敏锐的耳朵，但她决定不予以理会。

Asuka had very little time to react amidst the craze; she grabbed a handful of dark brown hair and pulled on it.  
在疯狂的喧嚣中，明日香几乎没有时间反应；她抓起一把深棕色的头发，用力拉扯。

"Four-eyes what are you doi-!" Lips closed in on skin and god, Asuka had never felt such a rush before, not even with the boys. Her words choked along the top of her throat and her back straightened on its own. Her body was clearly betraying her.  
“四眼仔，你在搞什么-！”嘴唇紧贴着肌肤，天啊，明日香从未感受过如此的冲动，甚至比和那些男孩们在一起时还要强烈。她的话语在喉咙上方哽咽，背部不由自主地挺直。她的身体显然在背叛她。

She cursed for her hip bucking forward and for the way her hand painfully tightened on Mari's scalp. She was panting, hyperventilating, it didn't matter what it seemed like as long as she wasn't moaning like a mad woman.  
她咒骂自己臀部向前挺的动作，以及手在真希波头皮上痛苦收紧的方式。她喘息着，几乎要窒息，无论看起来如何，只要她没有像疯女人一样呻吟就好。

She pulled the mouth at her thighs closer to her to try and stop Mari from advancing further in, maybe, before pulling her legs to her chest and jerking her hands away from Mari, as if she had been caught doing a terrible act. Her shoulders heaved with the burden of it all.  
她将大腿间的嘴拉得更近，试图阻止真希进一步深入，或许，在将双腿拉向胸前并猛地从真希手中抽回双手之前，仿佛被抓到在做一件可怕的事。她的肩膀因这一切的重负而剧烈起伏。

She looked up with struggling eyes, and with an equally struggling voice said, "_No_."  
她用挣扎的眼神抬头望去，同样用挣扎的声音说道：“不。”

Mari swiped her lips with her thumb. "You sure about that, Shikinami?" There was something twisted about her smile.  
真希用拇指抹了抹嘴唇。“你确定吗，式波？”她的微笑中带着一丝扭曲。

"That was a cheap move."  
"那招太卑鄙了。"

"You started it." "是你先挑起的。"

"It wasn't the same." "那不一样。"

"Everything counts the same in the bedroom, princess."  
“在卧室里，公主，一切都是平等的。”

Asuka's frown deepened and she harshly threw Mari's headband across the room. _You want something that's equal?_  
明日香皱眉更深，猛地将真希波的头带扔到了房间的另一边。你想要平等的东西？

The room started to fill with two quickening rhythms and continuous failed attempts. Whether or not they had lied to each other up to that moment didn't matter as long as the game kept going, as long as they kept feasting on the rush from seeing the other loosing more of their integrity.  
房间里开始充斥着两种加速的节奏和连续失败的尝试。无论她们之前是否对彼此撒过谎，那一刻都不重要了，只要游戏继续，只要她们继续享受着看到对方失去更多尊严的快感。

A lick to a breast mound; a lost pair of glasses.  
轻吻胸峰；一副遗失的眼镜。

A bite to the hip; two A-10 nerve clips fallen under the bed.  
轻咬臀部；两枚 A-10 神经夹滑落床底。

Then everything went still; Asuka and Mari were bumping heads, taking in every article of clothing they had lost in such a little amount of time. They had rolled up to the headstand of the bed, the proper place for Asuka to pin Mari beneath her. Her hip was being weighed down by Mari's grip, strong, pleading. Everything had gone according to plan.  
随后一切归于寂静；明日香和玛丽正互相碰撞着头，清点着在如此短的时间内丢失的每一件衣物。她们滚到了床头，正是明日香将玛丽压在身下的理想位置。她的臀部被玛丽紧握，力道强劲，充满恳求。一切都在按计划进行。

The British offered the first move; planting wet kisses along Asuka's jaw to the limit of her shoulder.  
英国人率先行动；沿着明日香的下颌一路湿吻至她的肩头。

"Have you always liked girls, Shikinami? Or", a lick to mend for a particularly strong bite, "are you experimenting on me?"  
“你一直都喜欢女孩子吗，式波？还是说”，她舔舐着以弥补那特别用力的一咬，“你在拿我做实验？”

Asuka clenched her fingers against the headrest, answering the question with another whimper and an arched neck. She took Mari's doubt as a challenge and, it being her turn, decided to end this once and for all.  
明日香紧抓着头枕，以一声呻吟和仰起的脖颈回应了问题。她将真希波的质疑视为挑战，轮到她时，决定一劳永逸地结束这一切。

Asuka firmly spread her fingers against the tense stomach and shove them rather roughly between Mari's pajama pants and her underwear. Her partner felt hot and soft under her touch. God knows she wanted more. But Mari was deathly quiet. No exhale filled with pleasure, no squirming about, no tensing up.  
明日香坚定地将手指压在紧绷的腹部，相当粗鲁地推入真希波的睡裤和她内衣之间。她的伴侣在她触摸下感觉既热又软。天知道她想要更多。但真希波死一般地安静。没有充满愉悦的呼气，没有扭动，没有紧张。

Mari grabbed the intruding hand and pulled the red head down on her lap. Her stare was the most serious it had ever been, her eyes piercing with a seriousness that, honestly, scared Asuka. The German knew right away, she had lost. There were no more moves she could play.  
真希波抓住那只侵入的手，将红发女孩拉到自己腿上。她的目光从未如此严肃，眼神中带着一种严肃，老实说，这让明日香感到害怕。德国女孩立刻明白，她已经输了。她已经没有可用的招数了。

"That's not how it works, princess."  
“事情不是这样运作的，公主。”

Mari grabbed her wide eyed partner by the wrist and pushed her down on the bed. Her voice was coming out tones lower. "You should know more than anybody. We're not like them, are we? Like the men."  
玛丽紧紧抓住她那瞪大眼睛的搭档的手腕，将她推倒在床上。她的声音变得低沉了许多。“你应该比任何人都清楚。我们和他们不一样，对吧？不像那些男人。”

She spread her palm atop Asuka's trembling neck and forced her chin up.  
她将手掌覆盖在明日香颤抖的脖颈上，迫使她的下巴抬起。

"It's not all about the big picture. Rather, its the small details," she forced Asuka's head to the side, "that make you," her mouth was ready at the girl's ear, "shiver."  
“这不仅仅关乎大局。恰恰相反，”她强迫明日香的头转向一侧，“那些微小的细节，”她的嘴贴近女孩的耳朵，“才让你颤抖。”

Asuka felt her earlobe taken in someplace wet and hot as something firm, Mari's tongue she supposed, circled around it. She thought of it pathetic, but that was it. Her weakest place was her damned ear. Asuka arched against the other body, the softest of moans escaping her. Finally, after endless and agonizing teasing, she could let go. "Oh, _fuck_."  
明日香感觉到她的耳垂被某个湿润而炽热的地方含住，想必是真希的舌头，正绕着它打转。她觉得这很可悲，但事实就是如此。她最脆弱的地方就是那该死的耳朵。明日香的身体不由自主地向另一个身体靠去，一声轻柔的呻吟从她口中逸出。终于，在无尽而痛苦的挑逗之后，她可以放松了。“哦，该死。”

After a few minutes of Mari generously keeping her work, she spoke against the sensitive part so firm and so close that Asuka thought the girl had gotten inside her thoughts. "I win."  
几分钟后，真希慷慨地继续她的动作，她对着那敏感而紧贴的部分说话，如此坚定和贴近，以至于明日香觉得这女孩已经进入了她的思绪。“我赢了。”

The bed sunk under the pilots again as Mari began to stand, but a force on her neck kept her down.  
当真希开始起身时，床再次因驾驶员们的重量而下沉，但脖子上的力量让她无法起身。

"Wait." Came a raspy voice with a heavy aryan accent. Asuka's grip was mercilessly, as if she would perish by letting go.  
"等等。" 一个沙哑的声音带着浓重的雅利安口音传来。明日香的手劲无情，仿佛一松手就会丧命。

Mari was surprised when the German pressed a sloppy, closed mouthed kiss on her. It would've been heart warming if all the pent up sexual drive wasn't in the way. Asuka pulled Mari even closer for a second try, to which she pulled back.  
当德国人用双唇紧闭的方式给了她一个湿漉漉的吻时，真希波感到惊讶。如果不是被压抑的性欲所干扰，这本该是令人心暖的。明日香将真希波拉得更近，试图再次尝试，但真希波却退缩了。

"Fight me for it." Was her response, firm and commanding. Very unlike Mari.  
"来和我争夺吧。" 她的回应坚定而命令式，与真希波平时的风格大相径庭。

Shikinami's control burst open like a dam and there was no stopping it. She lunged herself at her partner and growled at the pain of clashing teeth. Mari pushed back and bit the intruding tongue.  
式根的控制力如同决堤般崩溃，一发不可收拾。她猛地扑向搭档，因牙齿碰撞的疼痛而低吼。真希波反推回去，咬住了侵入的舌头。

Lips separated for a brief respite before they crashed again for some sort of dominance midst the clumsiness that inexperienced hunger brought.  
双唇短暂分开喘息，随即又猛烈相撞，在生疏的饥饿感带来的笨拙中争夺某种主导权。

The sound of rustling fabric fell into the same softness and rhythm as the small noises, some more noticeable than others, coming from both pilots; Mari had rested part of her weight on her smaller counterpart and was slowly grinding in between the pair of exposed legs.  
衣物摩擦的声音与微小的噪音融为一体，节奏柔和，其中有些声音比其他的更为明显，来自两位驾驶员；真希波将部分体重压在较小的搭档身上，缓缓地在暴露的双腿间磨蹭。

With every thrust Asuka would kiss deeper and groan more fiercely; her urges had completely taken hold of her, as if she was only half there while another being controlled her; a sensation that was both frightening and electrifying on its own.  
每一次深入，明日香都会吻得更深，呻吟得更激烈；她的欲望已经完全掌控了她，仿佛她只剩下一半的自我，而另一个存在在操纵着她；这种感觉既令人恐惧又无比刺激。

She would've never thought about grabbing her partners backside to writhe so unabashedly against the sensitive area. She took in sharp breaths of curse words when the stimulation wasn't enough. Sticking her tongue inside Mari's throat wasn't going to suffice, and neither was the careful licking of her carotids.  
她从未想过会如此大胆地抓住伴侣的臀部，毫无顾忌地在敏感区域扭动。当刺激不够时，她会猛吸一口气，咒骂出声。将舌头伸入真里的喉咙还不够，小心翼翼地舔舐她的颈动脉也不够。

Asuka wished it was, though; she prayed that she didn't need to go further than grinding and feeling Mari's hand travel up and down between her breasts. But she was loosing herself, all her previous rationale and inhibitions, and it felt really good. Now she knew why the boys in her class were so obsessed with sex.  
尽管明日香希望如此，但她祈祷自己不必超越磨蹭和感受真里的手在她胸前来回游走的程度。但她正在失去自我，所有的先前理性和抑制都消失了，这种感觉真的很棒。现在她明白了为什么班上的男生们对性如此痴迷。

Mari's distant voice brought her mind back. "Asuka..."  
玛丽的遥远声音将她的思绪拉回。“明日香……”

The brunette trailed off as she concentrated her efforts on keeping her body from exhausting itself. She could feel sweat sliding down her arms and the burn from gripping Asuka's wrist for so long. Mari could feel the thrill in between her legs so intense it made her back go weak. Asuka was reaching her limit as well.  
棕发女孩话音渐弱，她集中精力不让自己的身体耗尽。她能感觉到汗水顺着胳膊滑落，长时间紧握明日香手腕的灼热感。玛丽能感受到双腿间那股强烈的刺激，以至于她的背部都变得无力。明日香也快到极限了。

"What do you need, Asuka?"  
“你需要什么，明日香？”

Her free hand had started to travel down again, past Asuka's ribs, waist, and shorts. Another whimper.  
她的自由之手再次游走，掠过明日香的肋骨、腰际和短裤。又一声低吟。

"Tell me." “告诉我。”

Her hand passed the buttons of Asuka's shorts, the point of no return, to just above her center. A hiss.  
她的手越过了明日香短裤上的纽扣，抵达了不可回头的界限，停在了她私密之处的上方。一声轻嘶。

"Scheiße." "该死。"

Just as boundaries were going to be crossed, the girls readying for another heated kiss, a hideous sound blasted from the night stand; a call.  
就在界限即将被跨越，女孩们准备再次热烈亲吻时，床头柜突然爆发出一阵刺耳的声响；是来电。

The phone continued to ring as both girls looked at each other for the longest time in silent defeat, their eyes coming back to their original dilation. Mari removed her hand with the biggest sense of frustration she had yet to experience, "I've got to answer, princess. You know the rules."  
电话持续响着，两人长时间默默对视，眼神恢复到最初的扩张状态。玛丽带着前所未有的挫败感移开了手，“我得接电话，公主。你知道规矩。”

Asuka gave a semi conscious nod before letting her hand fall to her side. There was the unfamiliar ceiling again.  
明日香半清醒地点了点头，随后手垂到了身侧。又是那片陌生的天花板。

"Hello, Misato? Is everything okay?"  
“喂，美里吗？一切都好吗？”

"Good god..." Asuka breathed in the faintest of whispers.  
“天哪……”明日香几乎是用气声呼吸着。

"Oh yeah, we're fine, just here...watching TV. We were going to sleep, actually."  
"哦，是的，我们没事，只是在这里...看电视。其实我们正准备睡觉。"

Asuka rubbed her eyepatch, astounded that the day had gone by and no contamination episode had occurred.  
明日香揉了揉她的眼罩，惊讶于这一天过去了，居然没有发生污染事件。

"Yeah, I'll tell Asuka right now. 'Not to wait for you, 'cause you'll be making sweet love over at Kajis'. OW! Fine, fine. Bye."  
"好的，我现在就告诉明日香。'不要等你了，因为你会在加持那里甜蜜缠绵。'哎哟！好吧，好吧。再见。"

Pressing the red button solemnly, Mari sighed and put the phone down with a clack. She turned to Asuka, who by now was seated at the edge of the bed.  
庄严地按下红色按钮，玛丽叹了口气，手机随之啪的一声放下。她转向明日香，后者此刻已坐在床边。

"Misato says she'll be coming late. And that there will be another sync test tomorrow at 6 am."  
“美里说她会晚点到。而且明天早上 6 点还有另一次同步测试。”

"Tsk. Fucking great." Asuka rubbed a temple. She could feel Mari approaching, and then a bumping of heads. The voice that came next was tender, seeking acceptance.  
“啧，真是太棒了。”明日香揉了揉太阳穴。她能感觉到玛丽走近，然后是头部的轻轻碰撞。接下来的声音温柔而寻求接纳。

"You know, even I have to admit that I couldn't do all of this alone. It would be nice if you let others in."  
"你知道，即使是我也不得不承认，没有大家的帮助，我一个人是做不到这一切的。如果你能稍微敞开心扉，让别人参与进来，那就太好了。"

Asuka blinked silently at the words.  
明日香默默地眨了眨眼，看着这些话。

"Even if just a little, my dear partner."  
"哪怕只是一点点，我亲爱的搭档。"

"I think I already have." Asuka said in all honestly.  
"我想我已经有了。" 绫波说得很坦诚。

She could feel Mari smile, "I think you have, too."  
她能感觉到玛丽在微笑，"我想你也有了。"

After all the struggle, the pain, and the pleasure of that unexpected night, Asuka started to appreciate Saturdays in a different light. Maybe because she no longer had to suffer and be happy alone, and maybe because, she was willing to risk it all and open up to the only person who was willing to go in.  
经历了所有的挣扎、痛苦和那个意外夜晚的欢愉之后，绫波开始以不同的眼光欣赏周六。也许是因为她不再需要独自承受和快乐，也许是因为，她愿意冒一切风险，向唯一愿意走进她内心的人敞开心扉。

Well, there is absolutely no excuse I have for the ONE YEAR delay to this one shot. But here it is, and I hope that you guys still like it. It took me a while because I wanted to accurately depict what those first sexual encounters are like; when one as a teen is new to the whole experience and is filled with struggles as to how to proceed without loosing oneself.  
好吧，对于这篇短篇耽搁了一整年，我实在没有任何借口。但无论如何，它终于完成了，希望你们依然喜欢。我花了些时间，因为我想要准确地描绘出那些初次性经历的情景；当一个青少年初次体验这一切时，内心充满了挣扎，不知道如何在保持自我不迷失的情况下继续前行。

Also, I wanted to portray Asuka as an "aggressive bottom", but as I read it again and again, there seems to be no clear play of dominance here, no one person has more influence than the other, which in part is also true to sex. Sometimes there just isn't that clear division of roles, and I quite liked how it turned out.  
此外，我想把明日香描绘成一个“主动的被动方”，但反复阅读后，我发现这里并没有明显的支配游戏，没有哪一方比另一方更具影响力，这在某种程度上也反映了性的真实面貌。有时候，角色之间的界限并不那么清晰，我很喜欢这样的结果。

Anyhow, please leave feedback on the good and the bad with constructive criticism in mind. And lastly, thank you all for your support to this frustrated writer :]

[yourcloudnine](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2267653/yourcloudnine): honestly, i thought it was great. just a few rough spots to polish, but very good. loved the 'games are all we have' line, and basically all the dialogue. damn. though,'on some parts i didnt think that the characterization on mari was spot on, but i guess it really is hard to work with such a new character, so i understand. guess analyzing mari so much made me too critical on her characterization so, lmao. but really though, this is great. thanks for this!
老实说，我觉得写得很好。只是有一些粗糙的地方需要打磨，但非常好。我喜欢'游戏是我们的一切'这句话，基本上所有的对话都很好。不过，有些地方我不认为对玛丽的角色刻画很到位，但我想，要塑造这样一个新角色真的很难，所以我理解。我想，对玛丽分析得太多，让我对她的角色刻画过于挑剔了，所以，笑笑！
