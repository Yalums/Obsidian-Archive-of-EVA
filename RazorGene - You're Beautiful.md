It was morning classes at Tokyo 3 Highschool. Shinji was daydreaming, minding his own business. Shinji was thinking about his mother. Today was the anniversary of his mother's death. He had no intention of listening to the teachers ramblings. When his teacher announced that for the school project this trimester they would have to do a musical performance for their term average. The teacher divided the students into pairs. When it came to Shinj's name he was paired with Touji. Shinji sighed, as it was well known that Touji was not one for doing work. Any work, if you count shooting hoops as work. Asuka stood up and blurted out,  
这是东京 3 高中的早晨课程。真嗣正心不在焉，沉浸在自己的思绪中。他在想念他的母亲，因为今天是她去世的周年纪念日。他根本没打算听老师的长篇大论。当老师宣布这学期的学校项目是必须为学期成绩进行音乐表演时，老师将学生们分成了两人一组。轮到真嗣时，他和东治被分到了一起。真嗣叹了口气，大家都知道东治不是那种勤奋工作的人，哪怕是投篮这种“工作”。明日香突然站起来，大声说道，  
"Those two stooges couldn't dance or even sing, to save their lives."  
那两个家伙跳舞不行，唱歌也不行，真是毫无救药。

"Are you guys going to yodel or perform some interpretive dance."  
你们是要唱约德尔调，还是要表演一段解释性舞蹈？

Shinji replied, "I thought that…Mmmaybe I could sing."  
真嗣回答道：“我原以为……嗯，或许我能唱首歌。”

Asuka began laughing hysterically, "You sing, that would be a miracle."  
明日香突然狂笑起来：“你要是唱歌，那可真是奇迹了。”

"The invincible Shinji can not only pilot Eva but can also sing."  
战无不胜的 Shinji 不仅能够驾驶 Eva，还擅长唱歌。

"Oh, Shinji you're so wonderful I just wish I could be like you."  
“哦，真嗣，你真是太出色了，我多希望能和你一样。”

"Domkopff, when the day comes I'll show you what singing is."  
Domkopff，等到那一天，我会让你领略真正的歌唱是什么样的。

Shinji knew there was no point in replying to Asuka's insults any further. That would just make her even more angry. When Asuka's angry you do not want to be in the same city as her let alone the same apartment. But, Asuka's rants were only one of the many problems which Shinji had to deal with. The school bell rang which signalled the end of school. Shinji stayed in the class a few minutes after the bell rang to discuss with Touji, what they were going to do for the school project. "Umm Touji do you play any instruments," said Shinji. Touji replied, "Well I do play the guitar but, don't you play the cello." "The project says that one person plays an instrument and the other sings or dances." "Can you sing Touji?" Touji answered, "Not really, my voice is really groggy." "So lets hear you sing Shinji…"  
真嗣明白继续回应明日香的辱骂毫无意义，那只会激怒她。当明日香发怒时，你甚至不想与她在同一座城市，更别提同一间公寓了。然而，明日香的怒火只是真嗣需要应对的诸多难题之一。放学铃声响起，真嗣在铃响后留在教室里，与冬二讨论如何完成学校项目。“呃，冬二，你会演奏乐器吗？”真嗣问道。冬二答道：“我会弹吉他，但你不是会拉大提琴吗？”“项目要求一人演奏乐器，另一人唱歌或跳舞。”“冬二，你能唱歌吗？”冬二回应：“不太行，我的嗓音很沙哑。”“来吧，真嗣，唱给我们听听…”

"I'll try," said Shinji nervously.  
“我会尝试的，”真嗣有些紧张地说道。

"So what song you gonna sing," asked Touji  
“那么，你要唱什么歌呢？” 斗真问道

"A song I wrote, I'm still working on the lyrics though."  
我创作了一首歌，但歌词还在完善中。

"Just, sing man." 来吧，唱起来，伙计。

_My life is brilliant 我的生活绚烂多彩  
My life is brilliant  
我的生活非常精彩  
My love is pure  
我的爱纯洁无瑕_

_I saw an angel 我看见了一位天使  
Of that I'm sure  
我对此深信不疑  
She smiled to me on the subway  
她在地铁里向我微笑  
She was with another man  
她正与另一个男人在一起  
I won't lose to him  
我不会败给他  
I'm gonna sleep all night  
我打算睡上一整夜  
Cos 余弦函数_' _I've gotta a plan  
我有一个计划  
_

_You're beautiful 你真美  
You're beautiful 你非常美丽  
You're beautiful, its true  
你真的很美，千真万确_

_I saw your face in a crowded place  
我在人群中看到了你的面容  
And I don't know what to do  
我不知该如何是好  
Cos 余弦函数_' _I'll never be with you_  
我永远无法与你相伴

"So…what you think." 那么…你有什么想法？

Touji was speechless and all he could mutter was, "Amazing."  
冬二哑口无言，只能低声说道：“真是令人惊叹。”

It was night time at the Katsuragi residence and Misato was out for drinks with Kaji for the whole night and would probably only be back much later. This left only Shinji and Asuka, which meant that Shinji had to be on the look out. Asuka, as usual was bored out of her skull and announced to everyone, which was only Shinji, of her boredom. "Well, what am I supposed to do Asuka."  
在 Katsuragi 家的夜晚，Misato 整晚与 Kaji 外出饮酒，预计很晚才会归来。家中仅剩 Shinji 和 Asuka，因此 Shinji 需时刻留意。Asuka 一如既往地感到极度无聊，并向在场唯一的 Shinji 表达了自己的无聊情绪。“那么，Asuka，我该做些什么呢？”  
"Wanna kiss?"asked Asuka. Shinji spat out what he was drinking.  
"想接吻吗？"明日香问。真嗣一口把喝的东西喷了出来。  
"You know K-I-S-S-I-N-G, are you brain dead or something."  
你知道“K-I-S-S-I-N-G”吗，你是不是脑子有问题？  
"No, I'm not but isn't that something you should do with someone you like."  
不，我不是，但这不是你该和你喜欢的人一起做的事吗？  
"Well, I just want to try."  
“嗯，我只想尝试一下。”  
"Scared to kiss a girl on the anniversary of your mother's death. Is she looking down on you from heaven"  
在母亲逝世纪念日这天，你害怕亲吻一个女孩吗？她是否正从天堂注视着你？  
"No…pucker up." “不…把嘴撅起来。”  
"OK" 可以  
Both Shinji and Asuka stood up. Both prepared for the kiss."You're breath is tickling me". Asuka grabbed Shinji's nose.  
新治和飞鸟一同起身，准备迎接那个吻。"你的气息让我发痒。"飞鸟轻握住新治的鼻子。

Then it happened. Asuka went in for the kiss and Shinji began to stiffen but eased up enjoying the moment. The only problem was that he began suffocate from not being able to breath and broke off the kiss. Asuka ran to the bathroom pretending to be disgusted muffling her cries through insults and the running water."Why did I have to waste my first kiss on you…Disgusting."  
随后，事情发生了。明日香主动亲吻，真嗣起初有些僵硬，但很快放松下来，享受这一刻。然而，他因为无法呼吸而感到窒息，不得不中断亲吻。明日香跑进浴室，假装厌恶，通过辱骂和流水声掩盖她的哭泣，心中暗想：“为什么我的初吻要浪费在你这种人身上……真是恶心。”  
Shinji was getting pissed off, not only did Asuka ask him to kiss her but now she was complaining.  
真嗣越来越恼火，明日香不仅要求他吻她，现在还不停地抱怨。  
"You, know you don't always have to complain about every little thing." Then, realisation hit Shinji he should have never said a word, it was a death sentence.  
"你知道吗，你不必总是对每一件小事都抱怨。" 随后，真嗣意识到自己根本不该开口，这话无异于宣判了死刑。  
"What! Did you say Third Child."  
什么！你提到的是三儿子吗？

"I said that you don't have to complain about every little thing."  
我说过，你没必要对每一件小事都发牢骚。

"You were the one that wanted to kiss"  
“是你想要亲吻的”  
"You, never took into consideration how I felt."  
你从未顾及我的感受。  
"You never do!" 你从来都没做过！  
"So don't give me that crap of yours!"  
“所以别再跟我说那些废话了！”

"GEEZ, Shinji why you so worked up."  
哎呀，真嗣，你怎么这么激动呢。  
"It was just a kiss, and not a good one either"  
那只是一个吻，而且并不怎么样

"So, then why in the first place did you want to kiss me."  
那么，最初你为何想要吻我呢？  
"I don't know," retorted Asuka.  
“我不清楚，”明日香回敬道。  
"I just felt like it."  
“我只是觉得这样做挺合适。”

"Asuka, sometimes I can't understand you."  
明日香，有时候我真的不太理解你。

"Whatever," replied Asuka.  
“随便吧，”明日香答道。  
Shinji felt that the tension was building and that trying to get an answer out of Asuka was useless.  
真嗣感觉到紧张气氛逐渐升级，他明白试图从明日香那里得到答案是毫无意义的。  
Shinji thought to himself: "She was kinda of beautiful when we kissed."  
真嗣暗自思忖：“我们接吻的那一刻，她显得格外美丽。”  
"I think I might actually like Asuka, but she would never accept me."  
我发现自己可能真的对明日香有好感，但她绝不会接受我。  
"She thinks I'm weak useless, a wimp"  
她觉得我既软弱又无用，简直就是个懦夫  
"But, still she is beautiful"  
然而，她依旧美丽动人  
"That gives me an idea."  
这给了我一个灵感。

A couple of weeks passed and Asuka continued her brutal treatment of Shinji. Shinji was starting to like Asuka a little bit more each day. Sometimes, for a brief moment she would show a slight bit of kindness.  
几周时间悄然流逝，明日香对真嗣的严苛态度依旧。然而，真嗣却日渐对明日香萌生出些许好感。偶尔，她会在刹那间流露出一丝温情。

For example, during one of their walks home from school. There was a little girl crying in the street looking for her mother, bewildered and lost. Asuka went up to the girl and comforted him, this totally shocked Shinji. She asked the girl we she had last seen her mother. Eventually the little girl was returned to her mother. It was brief moments like that when Shinji saw the "real" Asuka that made him like her eve more and more.  
比如有一次，他们放学步行回家时，看到一个小女孩在街上哭泣，四处寻找她的母亲，显得十分迷茫和无助。Asuka 立刻上前安慰她，这一幕让 Shinji 大为震惊。Asuka 询问小女孩最后一次见到母亲的情形，最终帮助她找到了母亲。正是这些短暂而温馨的时刻，让 Shinji 看到了 Asuka 真实而善良的一面，使他对她的喜爱与日俱增。

But, what Shinji didn't seem to notice was the way Asuka had started to behave around him. The differences were slight but nothing out of the ordinary.  
然而，真嗣似乎并未察觉到明日香在他周围的行为已悄然改变。这些变化虽不明显，却也属正常范畴。

One difference was that her verbal abuse of Shinji had begun to lessen. Asuka had noticed a good side as well as a brave side about Shinji. She had started to develop feelings for Shinji, but she would never tell Shinji. She would never reveal that she had a crush on the person who was her competition. But, that was soon to change on the day that Asuka would come to realise Shinji's true feelings through something so simple, as a song.  
其中一点变化是，她对真嗣的言语攻击逐渐减少。明日香发现了真嗣善良和勇敢的一面。她开始对真嗣产生感情，但从未打算告诉他。她绝不会透露自己对这位竞争对手产生了好感。然而，这一切即将在明日香通过一首简单的歌曲领悟到真嗣真实情感的那天发生转变。

It was the morning of the musical performances.  
那天是音乐表演的清晨。

"You ready Shin man," asked Touji.  
"真嗣，准备好了吗？" 东治问道。

"Yeah, as ready as I'll ever be," replied Shinji.  
"是啊，我已经准备得不能再好了，" 绫波回答道。

"Touji and Shinji, you're up next. Good luck!"  
冬二和真嗣，下一个轮到你们了。加油！

"Here we go!" shouted Touji  
‘我们开始吧！’ 冬二喊道

"Yep..."replied Shinji "是的..." 绫波回应道

Touji sat down on a stool and began to get ready. He then checked that the guitar was working. He began to strum the guitar and Shinji walked up to the microphone and began to sing. Everyone's eyes were set on Shinji.  
冬二坐到凳子上，开始准备，接着确认吉他是否正常工作。他随即弹起吉他，真嗣则走向麦克风，开始演唱。众人的视线都聚焦在真嗣身上。

_With you 和你在一起_

The crowd that filled the auditorium burst into applause. Asuka just stood there dumbfounded. Asuka thought to herself:  
礼堂内挤满的人群爆发出热烈的掌声。Asuka 呆立原地，不知所措。她在心里暗想：  
"The Baka actually did it." Shinj then walked off the stage in the direction of Asuka. Asuka just stared at Shinji as he approached her. "He's probably going to mock me now."  
“那个笨蛋真的做到了。”Shinji 说完便朝着 Asuka 的方向走下舞台。Asuka 只是注视着 Shinji，看着他向自己走来。“他现在大概要嘲笑我了。”  
"Asuka, theres something I gotta tell you."  
明日香，我有件事得跟你说。  
"Are you going to mock me now Third Child."  
你这是要来取笑我吗，老三。  
"No, but I want to tell you something in private away from the crowd."  
“不，但我有些私事想避开人群私下告诉你。”  
"Please, come with me…" Shinji pulled Asuka by the hand outside.  
"请跟我来……" 真嗣牵着明日香的手，一同走到了外面。  
"SO what do you want to tell me Third Child."  
那么，三儿，你想告诉我什么呢？

"Ummm Asuka for a long time now I've…"  
嗯，绫波，我心里一直有些话……  
"Spit it out! Shinji"  
“说出来吧！真嗣”

"I LIKE YOU!" Asuka was shocked at what Shinji had said. Never in a million years would she have thought that Shinji would like her after the way she treated him.  
"我喜欢你！" 明日香听到真嗣的话感到非常震惊。她怎么也想不到，在自己那样对待他之后，真嗣竟然会喜欢她。

"Asuka you don't have to say anything to me." "I just wanted you to know that"  
明日香，你无需向我解释什么。" "我只想让你明白这一点。

"See you later then…" 那我们待会儿见…  
"WAIT!" 等一下！  
"What Asuka you want to laugh at me or something."  
“阿斯卡，你是想笑我吗？”  
"I don't care" 我不在乎  
"No I…" "What Asuka?"  
不，我……" "怎么了，明日香？  
"I like you too," stuttered Asuka  
“我也喜欢你。”明日香有些结巴地说道

A blush spread across Asuka's face as well as Shinji's. Asuka then slowly moved closer to Shinji, closing the gap between them and kissed him on the cheek.  
明日香和真嗣的脸上都泛起了红晕。接着，明日香慢慢地靠近真嗣，拉近了彼此的距离，并在他的脸颊上温柔地吻了一下。

"Asuka you know what." 明日香，你知道的。  
"What Shinj?" 有什么新鲜事吗？  
"You really are beautiful."  
你确实非常美丽。

### Comment
[J.G. The Gamer](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/854343/J-G-The-Gamer): Alright! All hail Asuka/Shinji! I had a bit of difficulty determining who was speaking at times. If one character is speaking, put all their lines in the same paragraph. That way, it'll be easier to know who is saying what. I liked this a lot.
好吧 明日香/真嗣万岁 我有时很难确定谁在说话。如果是一个角色在说话，就把他们的台词都放在同一段里。这样就更容易知道谁在说什么了。我很喜欢这样。

[Dar Sel'La](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/899297/Dar-Sel-La): Ahh, Shinji getting the balls to actually say something. It is a rare thing when that happens. And Auska actually admiting the same thing. Ok, yes both of them are slightly OOC, but short of having substantial time to work out things or a few major things that really make them think about how they feel about themselvs and the other, them being more open with thier feelings and being slightly OOC is the only way to make most of these stories work. OOC is not nessicarily a bad thing. Formating issues aside, its a good story, and I would love to read a continuation of it. Gunman is correct, the spacing needs work. You had it pretty good in the first part, then it looks like the extra lines got removed or something. Other than that, it is technically pretty good. Hope to see a part 2 soon.
啊，真嗣居然有胆量说了些什么。这种情况很少见。奥斯卡其实也承认了同样的事情。好吧，是的，他们两人都略显 OOC，但除非有大量的时间来解决事情，或者有几件大事真正让他们思考自己和对方的感受，否则他们更坦诚地表达自己的感受，略显 OOC 是让大多数故事成功的唯一方法。OOC 并不是一件坏事。撇开格式问题不谈，这是个好故事，我很想继续读下去。枪手说得对，行间距需要改进。你在第一部分写得很好，但后来好像把多余的行删掉了。除此之外，技术上还是不错的。希望能尽快看到第二部分。

[Okutai](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1027210/Okutai): Hey just wanted to tell you that I'm going through the older Eva fics and thought this was amazing. I don't usually like song fics but this was done quite well. Don't do more chapters because it could ruin the feel of this.
嘿，我只是想告诉你，我正在阅读旧版的《伊娃》小说，觉得这本小说非常棒。我通常不喜欢歌曲小说，但这篇写得很好。不要再写更多章节了，因为这会毁了它的感觉。
