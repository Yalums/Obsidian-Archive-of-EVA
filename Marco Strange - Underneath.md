### Chapter 1
Shinji was currently trying to get some sleep. Tomorrow, he and Asuka would get another chance at defeating the Angel. All they had to do was work together for once, but that was easier said than done. He had his eyes close as he laid on his side.  
真嗣此刻正试图入睡。明天，他和明日香将再次有机会击败使徒。他们只需要这一次合作，但说起来容易做起来难。他闭上眼睛，侧身躺着。

"Once this angel is defeated, we can stop being stuck together." Shinji sighed. "What even are the Walls of Jericho that she talked about?"  
"一旦打败这个天使，我们就能不再被束缚在一起了。" 真嗣叹了口气。"她说的耶利哥之墙到底是什么？"

Even after trying for so long, Shinji was unable to fall asleep. He didn't know if he was nervous or if it was one of the many nights he had trouble sleeping, but it annoyed him either way. His focus changed, though, when he heard someone lay down next to him.  
即使尝试了这么久，真嗣还是无法入睡。他不知道自己是紧张还是这只是又一个难以入眠的夜晚，但无论如何都让他感到烦躁。然而，当听到有人躺在他旁边时，他的注意力转移了。

"What the..." He slowly opened his eyes and jumped backward. In front of him was a sleeping Asuka. He sweated as he kept staring at her. "_What in the world is she doing next to me!? I thought she didn't want to be asleep next to me tonight!_"  
"什么鬼..." 他缓缓睁开眼睛，向后一跳。眼前是熟睡的明日香。他一边盯着她，一边冒汗。"她到底在我旁边做什么！？我以为她今晚不想和我一起睡！"

As he was looking at her, he couldn't help but look down at her loose t-shirt. He blushed as he realized Asuka would kill him if she knew he was doing that. He lifted his eyes back to her face, hearing her talking. Luckily, it looked like she was still asleep. He couldn't help but move closer as he thought about kissing her. He couldn't explain why, but he wanted to kiss her while she was in front of him. He slowly leaned in forward as he kept thinking about...  
当他看着她时，目光不由自主地落在了她宽松的 T 恤上。意识到如果明日香知道他在这么做，肯定会杀了他，他的脸颊泛起了红晕。他抬起眼睛回到她的脸上，听着她说话。幸运的是，看起来她还在熟睡。他忍不住向她靠近，心中想着要吻她。他无法解释为什么，但当她就在眼前时，他渴望吻她。他一边想着，一边慢慢地向前倾身...

"M..." Asuka mumbled, making Shinji stop in his tracks. "Mo...Momma..."  
“妈...”明日香喃喃自语，让真嗣停下了动作。“妈...妈妈...”

"Momma?" Shinji raised an eyebrow as he kept looking at her. He jumped as he saw her starting to cry. Before he could react, Asuka rolled to her side.  
“妈妈？”真嗣挑起眉毛，继续看着她。看到她开始哭泣，他吓了一跳。还没等他反应过来，明日香已经翻身侧躺了。

"Momma..." Asuka wept as she faced the other direction. "Why did you leave me, Momma? I need you. I don't have anyone else, momma."  
"妈妈..." 明日香转向另一边哭泣着。"为什么你要离开我，妈妈？我需要你。我没有其他人了，妈妈。"

Shinji gulped as he watched Asuka in her current state. He knew her as overconfident and not afraid of anything. Now he was watching her cry for her mother like a toddler. He couldn't explain why, but he put his arm over her and curled up to her.  
真嗣咽了口唾沫，看着此刻的明日香。他认识的她总是自信满满，无所畏惧。现在他却看到她像个幼儿一样为母亲哭泣。他说不出为什么，但还是伸出手臂搂住她，蜷缩在她身边。

"It's okay." He whispered as he leaned into her ear. "You're not alone."  
"没事的。" 他贴近她的耳朵轻声说。"你并不孤单。"

Asuka started to calm down after Shinji put his arm around her. Shinji could still hear her silently weeping, but he sighed as he saw her sleeping like normal. Without realizing he, Shinji was finally drifting off to sleep.  
在真嗣搂住她之后，明日香开始平静下来。真嗣仍能听到她在默默哭泣，但看到她像往常一样睡着了，他叹了口气。不知不觉中，真嗣也终于渐渐进入了梦乡。

The next day, Shinji rubbed his eyes as he started to wake up.  
第二天，真嗣揉着眼睛开始醒来。

"Man, that was some dream." Shinji slowly opened his eyes and jumped back. He saw Asuka still in front of him. Just like the night before. "So that wasn't a dream then."  
“天啊，那真是个梦。”真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，猛地向后一跳。他看到明日香仍在他面前。就像昨晚一样。“这么说那不是梦。”

As Shinji looked down at Asuka. A million things were going through his head. He didn't know how to explain to Asuka why she was there, let alone why he was curled up to her like that. Thankfully she was still asleep, but she'd probably be wondering how she went from one room to another. He then looked at the clock and realized it was earlier than they were supposed to get up.  
当真嗣低头看着明日香时，他的脑海中闪过无数念头。他不知道该如何向明日香解释她为何在那里，更别说他为何会那样蜷缩在她身边。幸好她还在熟睡，但她大概会疑惑自己是怎么从一间房到了另一间的。他随后看了看时钟，意识到时间比他们应该起床的时间还要早。

"What in the world am I supposed to do?" He sighed as he knew it would be over an hour before they'd be picked up. He looked back over at Asuka and saw she was still asleep. Right now, his stomach was growling, and figured that he wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. He went to the kitchen and started making himself something to eat. Since he just wanted anything, he had a bowl of cereal. As he ate, he couldn't get what he saw last night out of his head. "Was that the real Asuka I saw last night?"  
“我到底该怎么办？”他叹了口气，知道还要过上一个多小时才会有人来接他们。他回头看向明日香，见她仍在熟睡。此刻，他的肚子咕咕叫，心想自己大概是睡不着了。他走进厨房，开始给自己弄点吃的。既然只想随便吃点什么，他便盛了一碗麦片。吃着吃着，昨晚看到的情景始终挥之不去。“昨晚我看到的是真正的明日香吗？”

Shinji was still thinking about what he should do about what he saw. If he tried talking to Asuka, chances are she'd kill him or just deny it. If he tried telling Misato, Asuka would do the same thing. Part of him started to feel bad thinking that Asuka is like him and feels alone. He finished his cereal and looked back at the clock.  
真嗣还在思考该如何处理他所看到的事情。如果他试图和明日香谈谈，她很可能会杀了他或者干脆否认。如果他告诉美里，明日香也会做出同样的事情。他的一部分开始感到难过，认为明日香和他一样，感到孤独。他吃完麦片，回头看了看时钟。

"Well, I have a lot of time to kill anyway." He stood up and walked to a cupboard.  
“好吧，反正我有很多时间可以消磨。”他站起来，走向一个橱柜。

After some time, Asuka was awoken by the smell of something good. She sat up and rubbed her eyes. She jumped up as she saw where she was.  
过了一会儿，明日香被某种好闻的味道唤醒。她坐起来揉了揉眼睛。当她看到自己在哪里时，她跳了起来。

"Why the hell am I in here!?" Asuka stomped as she went looking for Shinji. "You baka! You better have a good explanation for..."  
"我到底为什么会在这里！？" 明日香一边跺脚一边寻找真嗣。"你这个笨蛋！最好有个像样的解释……"

"Good morning, Asuka." Shinji smiled as he sat a plate down at the table. I woke up early and thought I'd make you breakfast."  
"早上好，明日香。" 真嗣微笑着将一盘食物放在桌上。"我早起了一会儿，想着给你做早餐。"

"You..." Asuka froze as she looked at him and the plate. "You made me that for breakfast?"  
"你……" 明日香看着他和那盘食物，愣住了。"你为我做了这个当早餐？"

"I heard from Kaji awhile ago that you loved waffles. It's my first attempt at trying them, but I thought you'd love some for our fight today."  
"我之前听阿基说你喜欢吃华夫饼。这是我第一次尝试做，但我想你今天会喜欢在战斗中吃点。"

Asuka approached closer and saw what he made for her. There were two homemade waffles, topped with strawberry syrup and fresh-cut strawberries.  
明日香走近一看，发现他为她做了什么。那是两块自制的华夫饼，上面淋着草莓糖浆，还点缀着新鲜切片的草莓。

"You did all this for me?" Asuka stared at the plate. "Even though you're supposed to be focused on the battle?"  
"你为我做了这一切？" 明日香盯着盘子。"即使你应该专注于战斗？"

"Well, I wanted you to be 100 percent and wanted to show I'm happy that we're fighting together."  
"嗯，我希望你能全力以赴，也想表达我很高兴我们能并肩作战。"

"How did you even have a waffle maker to make these?"  
"你哪来的华夫饼机做这些？"

"Misato had it laying around." Shinji giggled. "I just thought it was time to break it out."  
"美里把它放在一边了。" 真嗣咯咯笑道。"我只是觉得是时候拿出来用了。"

Asuka stood there, unsure what to say. She could indeed get whatever she wanted, but no one ever treated her the same way Shinji was. They've spent the last few days usually fighting, and now he's making breakfast and telling her he wants her by his side.  
明日香站在那里，不知该说什么。她的确可以得到任何想要的东西，但没有人像真嗣这样对待她。过去几天他们通常在争吵，而现在他却在做早餐，告诉她希望她在他身边。

"Well, that's great that you did that!" Asuka grinned as she crossed her arms. "Of course, an ace pilot like myself wouldn't need this, but I appreciate the thought that went into it!"  
"嗯，你这么做真是太好了！" 明日香咧嘴一笑，双臂交叉。"当然，像我这样的王牌飞行员不需要这个，但我很感激你的用心！"

"I'm happy to hear that." Shinji continued to smile, making Asuka shocked. He expected him to roll his eyes at her like usual.  
"听到这个我很高兴。" 真嗣继续微笑，这让明日香感到震惊。他本以为他会像往常一样对她翻白眼。

"Well, I still need to brush my teeth either way." Asuka turned away and walked to the bathroom. "Don't you dare think about eating my waffles either, baka!"  
"反正我还是得刷牙。" 明日香转身走向浴室。"你敢打我华夫饼的主意试试，笨蛋！"

"I won't." Asuka took one last look and saw he was still smiling. She just kept walking to the bathroom and quickly closed the door. She then started brushing her teeth.  
"我不会的。" 明日香最后看了一眼，发现他还在微笑。她继续走向浴室，迅速关上门，然后开始刷牙。

"_What in the world is going on with him?_" Asuka looked at herself in the mirror. "_Why did he put all this effort into making me happy? I thought he hated me and was annoyed with our situation._"  
“他到底是怎么回事？”明日香对着镜子中的自己问道，“为什么他费尽心思让我开心？我以为他讨厌我，对我们这种情况感到厌烦。”

Once Asuka brushed her teeth, she rinsed out her mouth and took one last look in the mirror.  
当明日香刷完牙后，她漱了漱口，最后一次对着镜子看了看自己。

"Whatever it is, I'm not going to pass up a tasty breakfast." She smiled as she turned and walked back to the kitchen. "_Hopefully, that baka listened and didn't eat any of my waffles._"  
“不管是什么，我都不会错过美味的早餐。”她笑着转身走回厨房。“希望那个笨蛋听话，没有吃掉我的华夫饼。”

As Asuka walked back in, she saw the waffles were still there, and Shinji was now in the living room. Asuka decided to ask him about it later and eat her breakfast. She sat down and began cutting off a piece of a waffle. She put it in her mouth and almost screamed in joy from how good it tasted. She continued to eat it until it was completely gone.  
当明日香走回来时，她看到华夫饼还在那里，而真嗣现在在客厅。明日香决定稍后再问他，先享用早餐。她坐下来，开始切下一块华夫饼。她把它放进嘴里，差点因为它的美味而欢呼出声。她继续吃，直到完全吃完。

### Chapter 2
"_Come on, kids._" Misato watched on and smiled. "_I don't know why, but those two are working together perfectly._"  
"快点，孩子们。" 美里看着他们，微笑着。"我不知道为什么，但那两个人配合得天衣无缝。"

During the fight, Shinji and Asuka were perfectly in synch. If Misato didn't know better, she would believe they'd been practicing this for years. Now they were on the final attack, and then the angel would be finished. Shinji and Asuka yelled as they both delivered a kick at the same time. They both pushed the angel back several miles as they kept the kick going. Eventually, it stopped as a huge cloud of smoke covered the Evas.  
战斗中，真嗣和明日香配合得天衣无缝。如果美里不了解情况，她会以为他们已经练习了多年。现在他们正在进行最后的攻击，然后使徒就会被消灭。真嗣和明日香同时大喊着踢出一脚。他们一起将使徒击退了好几英里，持续着这一踢击。最终，随着巨大的烟雾笼罩了 EVA，使徒停了下来。

"We're not detecting the Angel anymore!" Aoba shouted.  
"我们检测不到使徒的信号了！" 青叶喊道。

"Visual should be back in a few minutes!" Maya added. Everyone waited to see what happened. When the smoke cleared, they breathed a sigh of relief.  
"视觉应该几分钟后就恢复！" 玛雅补充道。大家都等待着看会发生什么。当烟雾散去，他们松了一口气。

Both the Evas were now standing where the Angel stopped. Everyone was now cheering as they saw the plan worked perfectly.  
两台 EVA 现在站在天使停下的地方。看到计划完美执行，所有人都欢呼起来。

"Congrats, you two!" Misato smiled as she spoke into a mic. "I knew the both of you could do it if you put your mind to it!"  
"恭喜你们俩！" 美里笑着对着麦克风说，"我知道只要你们用心，一定能做到！"

"Well, of course, I could do it." Asuka grinned. "Are you forgetting who you're talking to?"  
"当然，我可以做到。" 明日香咧嘴一笑。"你忘了你在跟谁说话吗？"

"Asuka, that's not fair." Misato shot back. "You and Shinji both did this together, and you need to..."  
"明日香，这不公平。" 美里反驳道。"你和真嗣一起做的这件事，你们需要……"

"Actually, Asuka does deserve most of the credit." Shinji interrupted them.  
"实际上，明日香确实应该得到大部分的功劳。" 真嗣打断了她们。

"See? Even Third agrees that..." Asuka's eyes shot open. "Wait, what did you say?"  
"看吧？就连三号也同意..." 明日香眼睛猛地睁大。"等等，你刚才说什么？"

"You helped me get focused during our training together, and I'm not sure I could have done this with anyone else."  
"你在我俩一起训练时帮我集中注意力，我不确定换了别人我能不能做到。"

"Oh." Asuka was frozen for a few moments. She quickly regained her composure and smiled. "As long as I'm here, we'll be able to defeat any Angel that comes our way! So remember that!"  
"哦。" 明日香愣了几秒。她迅速恢复镇定，微笑道："只要有我在，我们就能打败任何来袭的使徒！记住这一点！"

"I will." "我会的。"

"_What is with him today?_" Misato thought as she looked at the Evas. "_This isn't the Shinji I'm used to seeing._"  
"他今天怎么了？" 美里看着 EVA 们心想，"这不是我熟悉的真嗣。"

After bringing the Evas back to Central Dogma, Shinji and Asuka went to change. When they saw Ritsuko, she told them how impressed she was and that they could take the rest of the day off. After, changing they waited for Misato to come to get them.  
将 EVA 带回中央教条区后，真嗣和明日香去换了衣服。见到律子时，她告诉他们她有多么印象深刻，并让他们可以休息一整天。换好衣服后，他们等着美里来接他们。

"There you are, Third." Asuka saw Shinji walking towards her. "I was wondering what took you so long."  
"你在这儿啊，三号。" 明日香看到真嗣向她走来。"我还在想你怎么这么慢。"

"Sorry, I didn't realize I was taking so long." He smiled and scratched the back of his head.  
"抱歉，我没意识到我花了这么长时间。" 他笑了笑，挠了挠后脑勺。"

"Again, with all the apologies." Asuka rolled her eyes. "I meant to tell you how annoying that's getting. It's like it's a reaction whenever I say something."  
"又是道歉。" 明日香翻了个白眼。"我是想说你这样很烦人。每次我说什么你都这样反应。"

"Oh, s..." Shinji stopped himself as Asuka raised an eyebrow. "I mean, I'll try to stop that."  
"哦，呃..." 真嗣话到一半停了下来，因为明日香挑起了眉毛。"我是说，我会尽量克制。"

"Okay, I've had enough of this." Asuka sighed as she stared at him. "What's the deal with you today? Ever since this morning, you've been different. What happened to the Shinji that thought I was annoying?"  
"好了，我受够了。" 明日香叹了口气，盯着他。"你今天怎么了？从早上开始你就变了。那个觉得我烦人的真嗣去哪儿了？"

"Well, I..." Shinji tried to think of a response as he starred back at Asuka.  
"嗯，我..." 真嗣试图想出一个回答，同时回望着明日香。

"There you two are." A voice came from down a hall. As they both turned, they saw it was their guardian Misato. "Are you both ready to go?"  
"你们俩在这儿啊。" 一个声音从走廊传来。两人转身一看，原来是他们的监护人美里。"你们都准备好了吗？"

"Well, actually," Shinji tried to say as he walked towards Misato.  
"嗯，其实，" 真嗣试图开口，同时走向美里。

"Don't even try it!" Asuka jumped in front of him. "You're not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on with you!"  
"别想蒙混过关！" 明日香跳到他面前。"你不把事情说清楚，哪儿也别想去！"

"Asuka, what are you talking about?" Misato held out her hand as she got closer. "Maybe he just wanted to praise the good work you did."  
"明日香，你在说什么呢？" 美里一边靠近一边伸出手。"也许他只是想表扬你做得好。"

"It's not just that!" Asuka turned to face her. "Shinji's been acting weird since I woke up! He made me waffles after hearing from Kaji that it was my favorite! Then he says it was to show how happy he was fighting with me!"  
"不仅仅是那样！" 明日香转向她。"我从醒来后，真嗣的行为就很奇怪！他听卡兹说我喜欢吃华夫饼，就做了给我！然后他说这是为了表达和我并肩作战的喜悦！"

"That's..." Misato stood there, unsure what to say. She knew Shinji's reactions seemed off, but hearing all of that made her more shocked. She got closer to them and looked at Shinji. "Is everything okay, Shinji? You know if something is going on, you can tell me."  
"那真是..." 美里站在那里，不知该说什么。她知道真嗣的反应有些不对劲，但听到这一切让她更加震惊。她走近他们，看着真嗣。"真嗣，一切都好吗？你知道如果有事，可以告诉我。"

"It's just..." Shinji started to say as he looked at both of them. He figured he wasn't getting out of this but still wasn't sure how to tell either of them why he was acting so different. He was close to spitting it out until.  
"只是..." 真嗣开口说道，目光在两人之间游移。他明白自己躲不过这一关，但仍不确定该如何向他们解释自己为何表现得如此不同。他几乎要脱口而出，直到...

"Shinji-kun, there you are."  
"真嗣君，你在这里啊。"

All three of them turned and saw Kaji walking towards them.  
他们三人都转过身，看到加持正朝他们走来。

"Hope I'm not interrupting, but I need Shinji to come with me for a moment." Kaji walked up and placed his hand on Shinji's shoulder.  
"希望我没有打扰，但我需要真嗣跟我走一趟。" 加持走上前，把手放在真嗣的肩膀上。

"What do you need Shinji for?" Misato raised an eyebrow.  
"你需要真嗣做什么？" 美里挑了挑眉。

"It's something to do with the commander. That's all I know." Kaji smiled.  
"与司令有关的事情。我就知道这么多。" 加持微笑道。

"My father?" Shinji turned to look at him as Kaji started dragging him down a hall. "Hey, wait!"  
"我的父亲？" 真嗣转头看向他，而加持开始拉着他走过一条走廊。"嘿，等等！"

"Later, Katsuragi!" Kaji waved as he walked away with Shinji. "I'll bring Shinji back to your apartment myself!"  
"待会儿见，葛城！" 加持挥手告别，带着真嗣离开。"我会亲自把真嗣送回你的公寓！"

"Ehh! Why can't I get an answer!?" Asuka stomped her foot. "Right when we had him cornered, my sweet Kaji-san dragged him away!"  
"哎！为什么我得不到答案！？" 明日香跺了跺脚。"就在我们把他逼到绝境的时候，我的甜心加持先生把他带走了！"

"Let's just head home and wait to get an answer." Misato sighed as she started walking.  
"我们还是回家等着答复吧。" 美里叹了口气，开始向前走。

"You think he's acting weird too, right Misato?" Asuka walked beside her.  
"你也觉得他行为怪异，对吧，美里？" 明日香走在她旁边。

"About that, can you tell me more about what he did this morning?"  
关于那件事，你能告诉我他今天早上做了些什么吗？

As Misato and Asuka were talking, Kaji had stopped after dragging Shinji away from them.  
当美里和明日香交谈时，加持已经拖着真嗣离开了她们。

"Okay, I think we're safe now." Kaji let go of Shinji and leaned against a wall.  
“好了，我想我们现在安全了。” 加持松开真嗣，靠在墙上。

"What are you talking about?" Shinji looked at him. "I thought you said my father wanted me for something."  
“你在说什么呢？” 真嗣看着他。“我以为你说我父亲有事找我。”

"Sorry, I had to lie to make sure Katsuragi wouldn't follow us." Kaji smiled as he lit a cigarette.  
“抱歉，我不得不撒谎，以确保桂同学不会跟着我们。”加持点燃了一支烟，微笑着说道。

"Wait, so you wanted to talk to me alone? Why?"  
“等等，你是想单独和我谈谈吗？为什么？”

"Like them, I noticed you were acting weird." Kaji was now starring at Shinji and no longer smiling.  
"像他们一样，我也注意到你行为怪异。" 加持现在盯着真嗣，不再微笑。

"Oh, that." Shinji scratched the back of his head as he looked up. "I just thought maybe if I was nicer to Asuka, she'd be nicer."  
"哦，那个啊。" 真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，抬头说道。"我只是想，如果我对明日香好一点，她也许会对我好一些。"

"Shinji, don't try lying to me." Kaji walked up and looked into his face. "My job requires knowing a lot of things, one of which is when someone is lying. No offense, but you're horrible at it."  
“真嗣，别想对我撒谎。”加持走上前，直视着他的脸。“我的工作要求我了解很多事情，其中之一就是识破谎言。无意冒犯，但你在这方面糟糕透顶。”

Shinji just looked down and frowned. He hadn't known Kaji that long, but he started to look up to Kaji like a father. He sighed as he looked back up at him.  
真嗣只是低下头，皱起了眉。他和加持相处的时间并不长，但他开始像对待父亲一样仰望加持。他叹了口气，再次抬头看向他。

"If I tell you, you promise you won't tell Asuka or Misato?"  
“如果我告诉你，你保证不会告诉明日香或美里吗？”

"Let me put it this way. If it's not a serious issue we should worry about, it will be between us." Kaji smiled and backed off. "Fair enough?"  
“这么说吧，如果不是什么需要我们操心的严重问题，那就只在我们之间解决。”加持笑了笑，退后一步。“这样公平吧？”

"I guess." Shinji sighed as he took a seat on a nearby bench. "I'm acting weird because of something that happened last night."  
“我想是吧。” 真嗣叹了口气，在附近的长椅上坐下。“我行为怪异是因为昨晚发生了一些事。”

### Chapter 3
"Last night?" Kaji raised an eyebrow. "What happened?"  
"昨晚？" 加持挑了挑眉。"发生了什么？"

"Well, it started when Asuka decided to sleep in another room from me and said it was like the Walls of Jericho." Shinji was looking down on the ground. "After that, I tried going to sleep."  
"嗯，事情起因是明日香决定不和我睡同一个房间，还说这就像耶利哥的城墙。" 真嗣低头看着地面。"之后，我就尝试入睡。"

"Of course." Kaji facepalmed as he started to mumble. "Why in the world did Asuka think he'd get that reference?"  
"当然。" 加持捂脸，开始喃喃自语。"明日香怎么会以为他能理解那个典故？"

"Did you say something?" Shinji now looked up at him.  
"你刚才说什么了吗？" 真嗣现在抬头看着他。

"It's nothing. Just continue." Kaji waved his hand.  
"没什么。继续吧。" 加持挥了挥手。

"Well, as I said, I tried to go to sleep and had trouble doing that. Then all of a sudden, Asuka was right in front of me."  
"嗯，就像我说的，我试着去睡觉，但很难入睡。然后突然间，明日香就出现在我面前。"

"Wait, she came back out after saying she wanted to be alone?" Kaji took a seat next to him.  
"等等，她说想一个人待着，结果又出来了？" 加持在他旁边坐下。

"No, she was still asleep." Shinji paused for a few moments and took a deep breath. "Then, while she was laying in front of me, she started calling for her mom."  
"不，她还在睡。" 真嗣停顿了一会儿，深吸了一口气。"然后，她躺在我面前，开始喊妈妈。"

"I see." Kaji kept looking at him. "Did anything else happen?"  
"原来如此。" 加持继续看着他。"还有其他事发生吗？"

"She..." Shinji looked back at the ground. "She started crying and saying she didn't want to be alone."  
"她..." 真嗣回头看向地面。"她开始哭泣，说她不想一个人。"

"And what did you do after this?" Shinji was now facing Kaji again, a little shocked at his question.  
"那你之后做了什么？" 真嗣再次面对加持，对他的问题感到有些惊讶。"

"I don't know why, but I put my arm around her and whispered that she wasn't alone."  
"我不知道为什么，但我搂住了她，轻声告诉她并不孤单。"

"I see." Kaji smiled as he put his arm around Shinji. "I know you don't realize it, but you did the right thing for Asuka that night. You're also doing the right thing telling me all of this."  
"我明白了。" 加持笑着将手臂搭在真嗣肩上。"我知道你没意识到，但那晚你为明日香做了正确的事。现在你把这些都告诉我，也是在做正确的事。"

"Really?" Shinji stared at him.  
"真的吗？" 真嗣盯着他。

"Asuka has done this multiple times in the past." Kaji sighed as he crossed his arms. "She doesn't realize it, but the reason I'm close to her is that I would do the same thing you did for her."  
"明日香过去也多次这样。" 加持叹了口气，双臂交叉。"她没意识到，我之所以与她亲近，正是因为我会像你那样为她挺身而出。"

"So Asuka has always had this problem?"  
"这么说，明日香一直有这个问题？"

"Yes, but she doesn't know about it." Kaji frowned. "It's not exactly something she'd remember since it's only in her sleep. It also doesn't happen that often."  
"是的，但她自己并不知情。" 加持皱眉道，"这不是她会记得的事情，因为它只发生在她睡觉时。而且这种情况也不常发生。"

"Does Misato know?" "美里知道吗？"

"Not sure on that one." Kaji blew smoke from his cigarette. "You let me worry about telling Katsuragi."  
"对那个不太确定。" 加持从香烟中吹出一缕烟雾。"你让我来担心怎么告诉葛城。"

"So, what do I do then?" Shinji raised an eyebrow. "They're going to keep asking me when you take me home, and I don't know what to say to them. Even if you tell Misato, Asuka would still want an answer."  
"那么，我该怎么办呢？" 真嗣挑了挑眉。"你带我回家后，他们还会继续问我，我不知道该怎么回答他们。就算你告诉美里，明日香还是会想要一个答案。"

"I have an idea for that." Kaji smiled. While Kaji was talking to Shinji about everything, Asuka and Misato were back at the apartment. At first, Misato thought Asuka was joking around, but seeing the waffle iron out made her think there was some truth to this.  
"我有个主意。" 加持微笑道。当加持和真嗣谈论这一切时，明日香和美里回到了公寓。起初，美里以为明日香在开玩笑，但看到华夫饼机摆出来，她开始觉得这事儿有点真实了。

"I mean, Shinji has always been helpful with the apartment, but he never goes this far." Misato sat at the dining room table with her arms crossed. "Did anything happen last night?"  
"我的意思是，真嗣一直都很帮忙打理公寓，但他从没这么过分。" 美里双臂交叉坐在餐桌旁。"昨晚发生了什么事吗？"

"Nothing I can think of." Asuka crossed her arms and closed her eyes. "Unless that pervert did something in my sleep and feels guilty about it."  
"我想不出有什么。" 明日香也交叉双臂，闭上了眼睛。"除非那个变态趁我睡着做了什么，然后感到内疚。"

"I doubt that's the reason." Misato sighed. "Shinji knows better than to try something like that."  
"我怀疑不是因为这个。" 美里叹了口气。"真嗣知道不该那样做的。"

"Well, whatever the reason is, I want answers." Asuka paced back and forth. "Ehh! Why did he need to be taken away, right when he was about to tell us!?"  
"好吧，不管是什么原因，我需要答案。" 明日香来回踱步。"诶！为什么他非得在我们即将知道真相的时候被带走！？"

"That does seem strangely convenient..." Misato frowned as she held her chin. "_If this was a trick by Kaji, I'm going to kill him._"  
"这确实显得有些蹊跷..." 美里皱着眉头，托着下巴。"如果这是加持的把戏，我非杀了他不可。"

Just as Misato was thinking about that, the door opened to her apartment. Both Asuka and Misato looked to see who it was.  
就在美里这么想的时候，她公寓的门打开了。明日香和美里都转头看向门口，想知道是谁来了。

"Kaji-san!" Asuka smiled as she put her hands together. "You came over to see me!"  
"加持先生！"明日香笑着双手合十，"你来看我了！"

"There you are!" Misato started stomping towards him. "You better have a good explanation for why you thought you could..."  
"你在这儿啊！" 美里开始朝他大步走来。"你最好有个好理由，解释为什么你以为你可以……"

"Hey, Misato." Shinji appeared beside Kaji.  
"嘿，美里。" 真嗣出现在加持旁边。

"There you are!" Asuka mimicked Misato. "Don't think you'll get out of this! I want answers now!"  
"你在这儿啊！" 明日香模仿着美里。"别以为你能逃掉！我现在就要答案！"

"Actually, it's me that needs to explain." Kaji raised his hand and smiled. "Shinji-kun has been acting weird because of something I told him."  
"实际上，需要解释的是我。" 加持举起手，微笑着说。"真嗣君行为古怪是因为我告诉了他一些事情。"

"What do you mean, Kaji?" Misato stopped and crossed her arms.  
"你什么意思，加持？" 美里停下脚步，交叉双臂。

"Oh, I told Shinji I was worried about Asuka not adapting to life in Japan, and he's been worried if that was the case." Kaji smiled as he scratched the back of his head. "That's why he's been trying to be nicer to Asuka and going out of his way to make her happy."  
"哦，我跟真嗣说我对明日香适应日本生活感到担忧，他就开始担心这是否属实。" 加持笑着挠了挠后脑勺。"这就是为什么他一直在努力对明日香更好，并尽力让她开心。"

"Oh, Kaji-san!" Asuka ran up and hugged him. He instantly hugged her back. "You were really worried about how I was feeling while living here!?"  
"哦，加持先生！" 明日香跑上前去拥抱他。他立刻回抱了她。"你真的很担心我在这里的生活感受吗！？"

"_Of course, she bought that._" Misato stared at him and then looked at Shinji. "_I'll just let it go for now until I can get a real answer._"  
"当然，她信以为真了。" 美里盯着他，然后看向真嗣。"我现在先不追究，等能得到真正答案再说。"

"Well, I should be going now." Kaji broke the hug. "Long day tomorrow, so I want to get some rest early."  
"嗯，我该走了。" 加持松开了拥抱。"明天又是漫长的一天，我想早点休息。"

"Do you really have to go so soon?" Asuka frowned.  
"你真的非得这么快就走吗？" 明日香皱起了眉头。"

"I'm afraid so, but you should thank Shinji for going out of his way for you." Kaji pointed at Shinji, causing Asuka to look at him. "He's the one that asked if there was something he could make for you to make you happy."  
恐怕是的，但你得感谢真嗣特意为你费心。”加持指着真嗣，让明日香看向他。“是他问有没有什么能为你做的，好让你开心。”

"Wait, you asked Kaji-san that so you could do that for me?" Asuka raised her eyebrows. Shinji nodded as he stayed quiet. Asuka sighed. "Well, thank you thi... I mean, Shinji."  
“等等，你问加持先生那些是为了帮我做这个？”明日香挑起眉毛。真嗣点点头，保持沉默。明日香叹了口气。“好吧，谢谢你... 我是说，真嗣。”

Shinji's eyes shot open, surprised. Normally, Asuka would only call him by his designation, but she used his name this time.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，感到惊讶。通常情况下，明日香只会用他的代号称呼他，但这次她用了他的名字。

"You're welcome." Shinji smiled.  
“不客气。”真嗣微笑着。

"Don't think this will mean I'll start falling for you or anything." Asuka grinned with her eyes closed. "I appreciate the effort. However, my heart belongs to Kaji-san."  
“别以为这会让我开始对你动心什么的。”明日香闭着眼睛咧嘴笑道，“我很感激你的努力。不过，我的心属于加持先生。”

"Later." Kaji turned around and started walking off. "See you tomorrow, Katsuragi."  
"待会儿见。" 加持转过身，开始走开。"明天见，葛城。"

"Yeah, yeah." Misato watched him walking away. She didn't know what he was hiding but figured he'd tell her tomorrow. She sighed and looked at Asuka and Shinji. She smiled as she saw both looked happier than usual. "How bout I take you both out for pizza tonight to celebrate?"  
“是啊，是啊。”美里看着他走开。她不知道他在隐瞒什么，但猜想他明天会告诉她。她叹了口气，看向明日香和真嗣。看到两人看起来比平时更开心，她微笑着提议：“今晚我带你们俩出去吃披萨庆祝一下怎么样？”

"I'd love that." Asuka smiled as she walked to Misato's car. "I get to pick the place, though."  
“我很乐意。”明日香微笑着走向美里小姐的车。“不过，选地方得听我的。”

"Don't I get a say?" Shinji followed her. "You haven't been here that long to know which ones are the best."  
“难道我没有发言权吗？” 真嗣跟着她。“你在这儿待的时间不长，还不知道哪些是最好的。”

"Ehh, Fine! Just pick someplace good or else!"  
“哎，好吧！选个好地方，不然有你好看！”

"Good to see things are still the same as usual." Misato smiled as she walked behind them.  
“看到一切如常，真好。”Misato 微笑着跟在他们身后。

### Chapter 4
It had been a week since defeating the Angel, and Shinji and Asuka were back at school. For the most part, everything was the same as usual. Currently, it was lunchtime, and everyone was getting ready to eat.  
自从击败使徒已经过去了一周，真嗣和明日香回到了学校。大部分时间里，一切如常。现在是午餐时间，大家都准备用餐。

"You made a lunch for me, right?" Asuka walked up next to Shinji's desk.  
“你给我做了便当，对吧？”明日香走到真嗣的桌旁。

"Of course." Shinji pulled out a bento for her.  
“当然。”真嗣拿出一个便当盒递给她。

"What did you pack this time?" Asuka took it from him and looked at it.  
"这次你带了什么？" 明日香从他手中接过，看了看。

"Well, I tried a couple of new things I thought you'd like." Shinji smiled.  
"嗯，我尝试了几样新东西，觉得你会喜欢。" 真嗣微笑道。

"Like what?" Asuka began to open the bento. As Shinji was talking to Asuka, Touji and Kensuke were looking at them.  
"比如什么？" 明日香开始打开便当。与此同时，真嗣在与明日香交谈时，东治和健介正看着他们。

"Is it just me, or is Shinji acting off?" Toji watched him with his arms crossed.  
"是我多心了吗，还是真嗣的行为有点不对劲？" 阿薰双臂交叉，注视着他。

"Maybe Shinji really has a crush on her." Kensuke shrugged. "I can't say I blame him."  
"也许真嗣真的对她有意思。" 健介耸了耸肩。"我倒不觉得奇怪。"

"I swear, there's something wrong with the both of you if that is the case." Toji facepalmed. "I don't know what you and Shinji see in that she-devil."  
"我发誓，如果真是那样，你们俩肯定都有问题。" 阿薰捂脸。"我不知道你们和真嗣在那女魔头身上看到了什么。"

"Hey, be nice." Hikari sat next to them. "Asuka is a friend, and she's actually nice when you get to know her."  
"嘿，友好点。" 光坐在他们旁边。"明日香是朋友，其实你了解她后会发现她很友善。"

"That's what I don't get, though. Look at them." Toji pointed at Shinji and Asuka, and the others turned towards them.  
"可我就是不明白，看他们。" 冬二指着真嗣和明日香，其他人也转向他们。"

"How did you forget to pack me a chocolate bar!?" Asuka stomped her foot and grabbed Shinji's shirt. "I told you I love a snack with my meal, and you forgot it!"  
"你怎么忘了给我带巧克力棒！？" 明日香跺着脚抓住真嗣的衬衫。"我告诉过你我喜欢在餐点时吃点零食，你却忘了！"

"I'm sorry. I thought we had some at home." Shinji looked down as Asuka kept starring at him. "I promise I'll buy some after school today."  
"对不起，我以为家里还有。" 真嗣低头看着明日香，她一直盯着他。"我保证放学后会去买一些。"

"Well, at least you're not just saying sorry as a reflex." Asuka sighed as she sat down and started eating. "You're lucky you're such a good cook."  
"好吧，至少你不是条件反射地说对不起。" 明日香叹了口气，坐下来开始吃饭。"你真幸运，厨艺这么好。"

"Thank you." Shinji smiled as he sat down and started eating.  
"谢谢。" 真嗣微笑着坐下，开始吃饭。

"Okay, I see Toji's point now." Kensuke adjusted his glasses. "When Asuka first came to our school, they would argue. Now he seems to take it whenever she's like that."  
“好吧，我现在明白 Toji 的观点了。” Kensuke 调整了一下眼镜。“当 Asuka 刚来我们学校时，他们会争吵。现在他似乎每次都能忍受她那样。”

"Maybe I should talk to her." Hikari looked at her friend. "I hope she's not taking advantage of Shinji being kind to her."  
“也许我应该和她谈谈。” Hikari 看着她的朋友。“我希望她没有利用 Shinji 对她的善意。”

"I'm going to talk to Shinji too." Toji crossed his arms. "Something's going on, and I want to know what it is."  
“我也打算和 Shinji 谈谈。” Toji 交叉双臂。“有些事情正在发生，我想知道是什么。”

School had ended for the day, and everyone was getting ready to head home. It was another sunny day in Tokyo-3, and everyone was getting ready for whatever they had planned for the rest of the day.  
学校的一天结束了，大家都准备回家。东京-3 又是一个阳光明媚的日子，每个人都准备好了他们计划好的余下活动。

"This time, I'll make sure you don't forget." Asuka was putting her shoes on. "It's not a complete meal unless you have a snack."  
“这次，我会确保你不会忘记。”明日香正在穿鞋。“没有点心，就不算一顿完整的饭。”

"I know." Shinji got his shoes on and was ready to head out. As both exited the school, they heard a familiar voice.  
“我知道。”真嗣穿好鞋，准备出发。两人走出学校时，听到了一个熟悉的声音。

"Hey, Asuka." Hikari walked up as Asuka turned to face her. "Want to hang out? I have a lot of free time today and thought we could do something."  
"嘿，明日香。" 光莉走过来，明日香转身面对她。"想一起玩吗？我今天有很多空闲时间，想着我们可以做点什么。"

"Oh, sure, Hikari." Asuka walked to her and then turned to face Shinji one last time. "As I said, don't forget to buy some chocolate on your way home."  
"哦，当然，光莉。" 明日香走向她，然后最后一次转身面对真嗣。"就像我说的，别忘了回家路上买些巧克力。"

"I'll remember." Shinji smiled as he waved. Asuka just turned away and walked with Hikari. Shinji made his way to the store while Toji was following behind him.  
"我会记住的。" 真嗣微笑着挥手。明日香只是转过身，和光莉一起走开。真嗣朝商店走去，而东治跟在他后面。

"So, how are things with you, Asuka?" Hikari turned to look at her as they walked side by side. "I take it, piloting the Eva is going well."  
"那么，最近怎么样，明日香？" 光转身看着她，两人并肩走着。"我想，驾驶 Eva 一定很顺利吧。"

"Of course it is." Asuka smiled. "With an ace pilot like me, no one has to worry about the Angels."  
"当然顺利。" 明日香微笑道。"有我这样的王牌飞行员在，没人需要担心使徒。"

"That's good." Hikari giggled. "It's nice having another protector and friend."  
"那就好。" 光咯咯笑道。"有另一个守护者和朋友在身边，感觉真好。"

Asuka smiled back at her comment as both of them walked into a clothing store. Both of them were looking through different outfits to try on. Both took a few different ones and walked to the changing room area. Both got into stalls that were side by side.  
明日香对她的话报以微笑，两人一同走进一家服装店。她们各自浏览着不同的服装准备试穿。各自挑选了几件后，走向更衣区。两人分别进入了相邻的试衣间。

"Hey, Asuka, can I ask you something?" Hikari held up a dress she had picked out. It was a light blue sundress.  
"嘿，明日香，我能问你件事吗？" 光手里拿着一件她挑选的裙子，那是一条淡蓝色的太阳裙。

"Sure, what's on your mind?" Asuka started taking off her uniform.  
"当然，你有什么心事吗？" 明日香开始脱下她的制服。

"Ikari has been acting a little different around you. Is everything okay?" Hikari was looking herself over in the dress.  
"碇君在你身边表现得有点不同。一切都还好吗？" 光子在镜子前打量着自己。

"Shinji says he wanted to be nicer because he heard from my sweet Kaji-san that he was worried about me fitting in here." Asuka put on a pair of denim shorts she found. She was also looking herself over in the mirror.  
"真嗣说他想对我好一点，因为他从我亲爱的加持先生那里听说，他担心我在这里适应得怎么样。" 明日香穿上了一条她找到的牛仔短裤。她还在镜子前打量着自己。

"That's why Ikari has been nicer to you?" Hikari raised an eyebrow and looked at the wall where Asuka was changing.  
"这就是为什么碇君对你更好了吗？" 光抬起眉毛，看着明日香正在换衣服的那面墙。

"Yeah, and he's so much better now too." Asuka smiled as she put on a red tank top to go with the denim shorts. "He doesn't just say sorry as an automatic response and is going out of his way to make me happy."  
"是啊，他现在也好多了。" 明日香微笑着穿上一件红色的背心，搭配牛仔短裤。"他不再只是机械地道歉，而是努力让我开心。"

"Like what?" Hikari lifted a dark green dress to try on next.  
"像什么？" 光拿起一件深绿色的裙子，准备试穿。

"Like the first day he started this, he woke up early and made me waffles for breakfast." Asuka smiled as she was trying to pick her next outfit. "Then, the next day, he made us that cake to celebrate me coming here."  
"就像他第一天开始这样做时，他早早起床给我做了华夫饼当早餐。" 明日香微笑着挑选下一套衣服，"然后，第二天，他为我们做了那个蛋糕来庆祝我来到这里。"

"He made that cake?" Hikari raised an eyebrow as she looked at herself in the new dress. "I'll have to ask for his recipe. That cake was delicious."  
"他做的那块蛋糕？" 光看着自己身上的新裙子，挑了挑眉。"我得找他要食谱。那蛋糕真是美味极了。"

"I know, and he also fixed my favorite yellow dress when I ripped it trying to unpack my things." Asuka smiled as she went to look in the mirror with her next outfit. "I didn't even have to ask. He heard me complain and fixed it the next day. It's like he..."  
"我知道，而且我最喜欢的那条黄色裙子被我撕破了，他帮我修好了。" 明日香笑着换上下一套衣服，走到镜子前。"我甚至都没开口。他听到我抱怨，第二天就修好了。就好像他..."

"Like he what?" Hikari turned to look back at the wall. "Asuka? Are you okay?"  
“像他什么？”光转身看向墙壁。“明日香？你还好吗？”

Unknown to Hikari, Asuka froze as she saw herself blushing in the mirror. Asuka felt her face with her hand and felt how warm her cheek felt. Asuka couldn't remember a time talking about someone made her blush. Not even talking about Kaji caused her to be like this.  
光并不知情，当明日香从镜中看到自己脸红的样子时，她愣住了。明日香用手摸了摸脸颊，感受到了那股温热。她记不起有哪次谈论某人会让自己脸红，就连提到加持时也不曾如此。

"Asuka!?" Hikari knocked on the wall. "Please talk to me!"  
"明日香！？" 光敲了敲墙壁。"请跟我谈谈吧！"

"I'm sorry." Asuka shook her head as she put the clothes down. "Hey, let me finish trying these things on, and we'll go get ice cream."  
“对不起。”明日香摇了摇头，放下衣服。“嘿，让我把这些试完，然后我们去吃冰淇淋吧。”

"Okay." Hikari backed away from the wall. "I'm almost done, so I'll only be a minute."  
“好的。”光从墙边退开。“我快完成了，所以只需要一分钟。”

"Got it." Asuka starting changing into a red dress she picked out. She stayed turned away from the mirror as she felt that her face was still warm.  
“明白了。”明日香开始换上她挑选的红色连衣裙。她背对着镜子，感觉自己的脸颊依旧发烫。

### Chapter 5
Shinji was inside a grocery store, buying food. He pulled through the candy aisle, trying to find the right chocolate to get for Asuka. Asuka wasn't picky about which chocolate to get, but he also wanted to make sure it would be one she would like.  
真嗣在一家杂货店里买食物。他穿过糖果货架，试图找到适合给明日香买的巧克力。明日香对巧克力的选择并不挑剔，但他也希望确保她会喜欢。

"Would she like this one?" Shinji picked up one of the many bars available.  
“她会喜欢这个吗？”真嗣拿起众多巧克力中的一款。

"Hey, Shinji!" A familiar voice came from his side. Shinji turned, knowing who it was.  
“嘿，真嗣！”一个熟悉的声音从他身边传来。真嗣转身，知道是谁。

"Oh, hey, Toji." Shinji smiled as he stood there. "Are you doing some shopping as well?"  
"哦，嘿，冬二。" 真嗣站在那里微笑着。"你也在购物吗？"

"Why else would I be here?" Toji laughed as he walked over to him. "I always stop by to get chocolate for my little sister."  
"不然我为什么会在这里？" 冬二笑着向他走来。"我总是顺便给妹妹买巧克力。"

"Oh, that's nice of you." Shinji jumped as he forgot about his little sister. "How is she doing?"  
"哦，你真贴心。" 真嗣突然想起自己的妹妹，跳了起来。"她最近怎么样？"

"She's doing well." Toji faced the chocolate bars and began scanning through them. "They said she'll still be in the hospital for a while, but the important thing is she's doing better."  
"她恢复得不错。" 冬二面对着巧克力棒，开始逐一查看。"他们说她还得在医院待一段时间，但重要的是她正在好转。"

"That's good." Shinji looked down as he thought back to why she was in the hospital.  
"那很好。" 真嗣低头沉思，回想她为何会住院。

"Here's it is." Shinji looked up and saw Toji holding up a bar. "These are Sakura's favorite."  
"找到了。" 真嗣抬头，看到冬二手中拿着一根巧克力棒。"这是樱最喜欢的。"

"Oh, what a coincidence." Shinji took a look at the bar. "That's the one Asuka likes the most."  
"哦，真巧啊。" 真嗣看了一眼酒吧。"那是明日香最喜欢的。"

"I hope that's not a sign of my little sister turning into her in the future." Toji sighed as he put the chocolate in his basket.  
"希望这不是我妹妹将来变成她的预兆。" 阿斯叹了口气，把巧克力放进篮子里。"

"I'm sure she'll grow up to be nice." Shinji giggled as he grabbed the same chocolate too. They both started walking to the register and checked out. They were now walking outside together.  
"我相信她会长成一个好孩子。" 真嗣笑着也拿了同样的巧克力。两人一起走向收银台结账，然后一同走出店外。"

"So, you and Asuka seem to be getting along better." Toji looked over at Shinji.  
"这么说，你和明日香的关系似乎有所改善了。" 真嗣看向了真治。

"I guess you could say that." Shinji kept looking forward and smiling.  
"我想可以这么说吧。" 真治继续向前看，脸上带着微笑。

"I mean, she still yells a lot, but you mostly brush it off now."  
"我是说，她还是经常大喊大叫，但你现在大多能一笑置之了。"

"Seems to have a positive effect, don't you think?" Shinji turned to look at him and smiled.  
"似乎产生了积极的效果，你不觉得吗？" 真嗣转头看向他，微笑着。

"What do you mean?" Toji stopped and raised an eyebrow. "She's still yelling all the time and acting like the queen of everything."  
"你什么意思？" 冬二停下脚步，挑了挑眉毛。"她还是一如既往地大喊大叫，像个万事通女王一样。"

"True, but today was the first time she ever complimented my cooking." Shinji closed his eyes. "Asuka never compliments me."  
"确实如此，但今天她第一次夸赞了我的厨艺。" 真嗣闭上眼睛。"明日香从不夸我。"

"That..." Toji's eyes grew wide as he heard what Shinji told them. "Holy crap, she did compliment you. I didn't even realize she did that earlier."  
"那..." 听到真嗣告诉他们的话，冬二瞪大了眼睛。"天哪，她真的夸你了。我之前都没注意到她这么做了。"

"Yep. So I would say things seem to be positive now." Shinji opened his eyes and kept smiling.  
"没错。所以我觉得现在情况看起来是积极的。" 真嗣睁开眼睛，继续微笑着。

"And you just decided one day to start being positive to her because you thought it would do this?" Toji raised an eyebrow.  
"你就这么突然决定开始对她积极起来，因为你觉得这样会有好结果？" 冬二挑了挑眉。

"Yep." "嗯。"

"You sure nothing else is going on?" Toji got face to face with Shinji.  
"你确定没有其他事情发生吗？" 真嗣和真希面对面。

"What's with all the sudden interest now?" Shinji held his arms up as he took a step back. Toji relaxed and smiled as he saw Shinji back up.  
"怎么突然这么感兴趣了？" 真嗣举起双臂，后退一步。看到真嗣后退，真希放松下来，微笑着。

"Oh, Ken was just guessing that you had a crush on Asuka and was just doing this to get with her."  
"哦，剑只是猜测你暗恋明日香，所以才这么做来接近她。"

"Oh." Shinji froze as he began blushing.  
"哦。" 真嗣愣住了，脸开始泛红。

"It's true, isn't it?" Touji pointed at him and started laughing.  
"这是真的，对吧？" 冬二指着他，开始大笑。

"I... I mean..." Shinji scratched the back of his head as he looked down.  
“我... 我是说...” 真嗣挠了挠后脑勺，低头看着地面。

"I swear, I don't know what you and Ken see in that girl." Toji sighed as he turned away and started walking. "I'm off to see my sister. Later."  
"我发誓，我不知道你和 Ken 怎么就看上那女孩了。" Toji 叹了口气，转身开始走开。"我要去看我妹妹了。回见。"

"Oh, bye." Shinji waved as Toji was walking away. As he said, Toji went to the hospital and sat with his sister for a while. He told her how things were going in school and that there was a new Eva pilot. Sakura asked if she could meet her, but Toji said he wasn't sure if that was possible. As they were talking, Hikari came into the room.  
"哦，再见。" Shinji 挥手告别正走开的 Toji。正如他所说，Toji 去了医院，陪妹妹坐了一会儿。他告诉她学校里的事情，还有一位新的 Eva 驾驶员。Sakura 问她能否见见她，但 Toji 说他不确定是否有可能。正当他们交谈时，Hikari 走进了房间。

"Hi, Hikari!" Sakura smiled as she waved. "Toji told me there's a new pilot, and you're friends with her!"  
"嗨，光！" 樱笑着挥手。"东治告诉我有个新驾驶员，而且你和她还是朋友！"

"Yep." Hikari smiled. "We get along well and just got done hanging out."  
"是啊。" 光微笑道。"我们相处得很好，刚刚才一起玩过。"

"Can I meet her?" Sakura put her hands together. "She sounds so cool, and I like her red Eva."  
"我能见见她吗？" 樱双手合十。"她听起来很酷，而且我喜欢她的红色 EVA。"

"I'll bring it up to her and see what she says." Hikari giggled. "Sakura, would you mind if I talk to your brother for a minute outside?"  
“我会跟她提一下，看看她怎么说。”光笑着说，“樱，介意我跟你哥哥在外面聊一会儿吗？”

"No. That's fine." She smiled as Toji got up from his seat.  
“不，没关系。”她微笑着，看着真嗣从座位上站起来。

"I'll be right back." Toji smiled as he followed Hikari outside in the hall. They walked over to an empty waiting room and sat next to each other. "So, how did things go with you and Asuka?"  
“我马上回来。”真嗣微笑着跟着光走出大厅。他们走到一间空着的等候室，并肩坐下。“那么，你和明日香怎么样了？”

"Well, I don't think Asuka is taking advantage of Ikari." Hikari held her chin. "But, there's something off about both of them. I don't know what it is, but Asuka acted off earlier."  
“嗯，我觉得明日香并没有利用真嗣。”光托着下巴说，“但他们俩都有点不对劲。我不知道是什么，但明日香之前表现得有些奇怪。”

"Tell me about it." Toji sighed. "Did you even realize Asuka complimented Shinji in front of us earlier?"  
"说来话长。" 冬二叹了口气。"你注意到吗，之前明日香在我们面前夸了真嗣？"

"What do you mean?" Hikari raised an eyebrow.  
"你什么意思？" 光抬起眉毛问道。

"Remember when she was yelling about Shinji forgetting the snack for her lunch and then complimented his cooking?" Toji looked at Hikari and saw her eyes go wide.  
"记得她之前大喊大叫说真嗣忘了给她带午饭的小吃，然后又夸他做饭好吃的事吗？" 冬二看着光，发现她的眼睛瞪大了。

"I didn't even notice that." Hikari placed her hand on her head.  
“我都没注意到。”光把手放在头上。

"Wait, if you didn't notice that, then what were you referring to about Asuka acting off earlier?" Toji raised an eyebrow. Hikari sighed and turned to look at Toji.  
“等等，如果你没注意到那个，那你之前说惣流行为怪异是指什么？” 真嗣挑起眉毛。美里叹了口气，转头看向真嗣。

"She was talking about how Shinji made her breakfast and the cake for when we celebrated Asuka being here. Then she said he fixed a dress she accidentally ripped, and she didn't even ask her to do that."  
她谈到了真嗣为她做早餐，还有我们庆祝明日香到来时准备的蛋糕。接着她说他修补了一件她不小心撕破的裙子，她甚至没要求他这么做。

"Okay, that's weird for Shinji to go that far," Toji raised an eyebrow. "But what's that have to do with Asuka being weird?"  
"好吧，真嗣做到这种程度有点奇怪，" 冬二挑了挑眉。"但这和明日香有什么关系呢？"

"She sounded happy talking about it. Like she loved Shinji doing all those things." Hikari closed her eyes and sighed. "There's also another thing, but promise you won't tell anyone else about this."  
"她谈起这些时听起来很开心。好像她很喜欢真嗣做这些事。" 光闭上眼睛叹了口气。"还有一件事，但你要答应我不要告诉别人。"

"Sure." Toji leaned closer to her. Hikari leaned towards his ear to whisper to him.  
“当然。” 冬二向她靠近了些。光靠向他的耳朵，低声对他说。

"She tried to hide it, but Asuka was blushing after saying all that about Shinji."  
“她试图掩饰，但说起真嗣时，明日香的脸还是红了。”

"Come again?" Toji leaned away to look at Hikari. "You can't be serious."  
"再说一遍？" 冬二向后靠了靠，看着光。"你不是认真的吧。"

"It's the truth." Hikari sighed.  
"这是真的。" 光叹了口气。

"I was not ready to find all this out." Toji sighed as he facepalmed. "Why couldn't it just be Shinji having a crush on her?"  
“我还没准备好知道这一切。” 真嗣叹了口气，捂住了脸。“为什么不能只是真嗣对她有好感呢？”

"Sounds like you regret being curious about all this." Hikari giggled.  
听起来你好像后悔对这一切感到好奇了。光笑了起来。

"A little." Toji sighed as he got up. "Come on, let's go back to check on Sakura."  
"一点点。" 冬二叹了口气，站起身来。"走吧，我们回去看看樱。"

"Okay." Hikari nodded as she got up and followed him back to Sakura's room.  
"好的。" 光点点头，站起身跟着他回到樱的房间。

### Chapter 6
"Thank you again for taking me shopping for a bikini, Kaji." Asuka smiled as she looked through the swimsuits.  
"再次感谢你带我来买比基尼，加持。" 明日香微笑着浏览着泳装。

"No problem." Kaji smiled as he followed behind her. "See anything yet?"  
"没事。" 加持微笑着跟在她后面。"看中什么了吗？"

"Not yet." Asuka was currently looking through different swimsuits they had available. "Sorry, it's taking so long."  
"还没。" 明日香正在浏览店里提供的不同泳装。"抱歉，花了这么长时间。"

"It's no problem." Kaji laughed as he thought to himself. "_She's just like Misato when she would drag me to go shopping with her._"  
"没事的。" 加持笑着心想。"她就像美里一样，总是拉我去逛街。"

"Found it!" Asuka held up a red and white bikini. "What do you think!?"  
"找到了！" 明日香举起一件红白相间的比基尼。"你觉得怎么样！？"

"Well, red is your color." Kaji smiled as Asuka showed him the bikini. "I'm sure Shinji will like it as well."  
"嗯，红色很适合你。" 加持微笑着看明日香展示比基尼。"我相信真嗣也会喜欢的。"

"What!?" Asuka stomped her foot and turned her head. "Like I care about his opinion about what I'd wear!"  
"什么！？" 明日香跺了跺脚，转过头去。"我才不在乎他对我穿什么有什么看法呢！"

"Sure." Kaji giggled as he watched Asuka's reaction. After he bought the bikini for her, she took her to a cafe.  
"当然。" 加持看着明日香的反应咯咯笑了起来。给她买了比基尼后，他带她去了一家咖啡馆。

"I still can't believe you brought up Shinji like that." Asuka sighed as she took a drink.  
"我还是不敢相信你那样提起真嗣。" 明日香叹了口气，喝了一口饮料。

"Don't you mean, Third?" Kaji smiled as Asuka blushed and turned her head away. "It's surprising that you're no longer calling Shinji-Kun by that name. Especially since you kept using it before you met him."  
"你不是想说，三号机吗？" 加持笑着，看着明日香脸红并把头转开。"真让人意外，你不再用那个名字称呼真嗣君了。尤其是你之前一直这么叫他的。"

"He's a fellow pilot that I fight alongside." Asuka kept looking away. "I only want to be respectful to a fellow pilot, like how he's respectful to me."  
"他是我并肩作战的战友。" 明日香依旧没有转头。"我只是想对一个战友表示尊重，就像他对我一样。"

"So, are you and Rei getting along as well?"  
"那么，你和丽相处得还好吗？"

"Can't we talk about something else!?" Asuka turned her head to look at Kaji, now with wide eyes. "Like the trip, our class is going on?"  
"我们就不能聊点别的吗？！" 明日香转过头，睁大眼睛看着加持。"比如我们班要去的旅行？"

"Oh, I almost forgot about that." Kaji sighed. "Forgive me. When I was your age, I didn't get to go on a trip."  
"哦，我差点忘了这事。" 加持叹了口气。"原谅我。我像你这么大的时候，没机会去旅行。"

"How come?" Asuka raised an eyebrow.  
"为什么呢？" 明日香挑了挑眉毛。

"Oh, just a little something called the Second Impact."  
"哦，就是那个所谓的第二次冲击。"

Kaji and Asuka spent the rest of the time talking about how excited she was to go on the trip. While she loved being an Eva Pilot, she also loved the idea of a nice long vacation. However, she was now having the opposite reaction in Misato's apartment.  
加治和明日香在剩下的时间里聊着她对这次旅行的兴奋之情。虽然她热爱成为 Eva 驾驶员，但她也喜欢长时间度假的想法。然而，现在她在美里公寓里却有了相反的反应。

"What do you mean I'm not allowed to go on the trip!?" Asuka slammed her hands on the table.  
"你什么意思，我不被允许去旅行！？" 明日香双手猛拍桌子。

"Asuka, really think about this." Misato squeezed the bridge of her nose. "You are one of three pilots we have to fight the Angels. Even when you and Shinji fought together, you had some difficulties."  
"明日香，真的要好好考虑一下。" 美里捏了捏鼻梁。"你是我们对抗使徒的三名驾驶员之一。即使你和真嗣一起战斗时，也遇到了一些困难。"

"But that's unfair!" Asuka crossed her arms. "I'm only asking to have some fun on a vacation which I deserve for all the work I do!"  
"但这不公平！" 明日香交叉双臂。"我只是要求在应得的假期里找点乐子，这都是我辛勤工作的回报！"

"And I appreciate that, Asuka." Misato opened her eyes and crossed her arms. "However, we need all of you to be ready if we need you."  
"我理解你的心情，明日香。" 美里睁开眼睛，也交叉起双臂。"然而，我们需要你们随时待命，以防万一。"

"I can't believe this." Asuka sighed as she turned to look at Shinji. "And you're fine with this?"  
"真不敢相信。" 明日香叹了口气，转向看着真嗣。"你对此没意见吗？"

"Well," Shinji looked down for a second before looking back up at Asuka. "I think you deserve more than just a vacation for everything you do."  
"嗯，" 真嗣低头片刻，然后重新抬头看向明日香。"我觉得你所做的一切，值得的不只是一个假期。"

"And the reason you're not fighting for that right now?" Asuka raised an eyebrow.  
"那你现在为什么不争取这个权利呢？" 明日香挑了挑眉。

"Before I met you or Ayanami, I was the only pilot." Shinji looked down. "I wasn't exactly the best pilot, and I wouldn't say I'm anywhere near the best pilot right now. If you were gone, I'm not sure I'd be able to fight the Angels on my own anymore."  
"在我遇见你或绫波之前，我是唯一的驾驶员。" 真嗣低头说道，"我并非最出色的驾驶员，现在也远非最优秀。如果你不在了，我不确定自己还能否独自对抗使徒。"

"You killed a few Angels before I showed up, though." Asuka's uncrossed her arms and stared at Shinji. "Sure, Wondergirl helped you with one of them, but that's still three Angels you killed."  
"尽管如此，在我出现之前你已经击败了几只使徒。" 明日香放下双臂，盯着真嗣，"没错，那个三无女确实帮你对付过一只，但那也意味着你独自消灭了三只使徒。"

"I'm pretty sure I got lucky both of those times." Shinji frowned. "Fighting with you, though, makes me feel like I don't have to be as worried anymore."  
“我相当确定那两次我都挺走运的。”真嗣皱了皱眉。“不过和你并肩作战，让我觉得不再那么需要担心了。”

Asuka took a moment as she looked at Shinji and then looked at Misato. Shinji was still frowning, and Misato just looked at the both of them with a blank expression.  
明日香看了一会儿真嗣，然后转向美里。真嗣依旧皱着眉头，而美里只是面无表情地看着他们俩。

"Fine." Asuka sighed as she crossed her arms. "Since I am the best pilot NERV has, I'll stay so I can take care of any Angels that might show up."  
“好吧。”明日香叹了口气，双臂交叉。“既然我是 NERV 最优秀的驾驶员，我会留下来以防有使徒出现。”

"I'm happy to hear that." Shinji smiled. "Plus, I'm sure NERV will reward you for all you do for us."  
“很高兴听到你这么说。”真嗣微笑道。“而且，我相信 NERV 会因为你为我们所做的一切而奖励你的。”

"Also, a good point." Asuka smiled as she turned to go to her room. "You can start by making dinner like usual while I change."  
"也是个好主意。" 明日香微笑着转身回自己的房间。"你可以像往常一样开始准备晚餐，我换件衣服。"

"Of course." Shinji got up and began making dinner for the three of them like he usually did.  
"当然。" 真嗣起身开始为他们三人准备晚餐，就像平时一样。"

"Wait a minute." Misato got up, making both of them freeze to look at them. Asuka was standing there confused, while Shinji began to sweat. Misato sighed before smiling. "I just wanted to say I love that all of us are getting along like a family."  
"等一下。" 美里站起身，让两人都愣住了，看着她。明日香站在那里一脸困惑，而真嗣开始冒汗。美里叹了口气，然后微笑道："我只是想说，我很高兴我们像一家人一样和睦相处。"

"Oh." Asuka kept looking at her guardian, confused. "I like that too."  
"哦。" 明日香继续看着她的监护人，感到困惑。"我也喜欢那个。"

As Asuka walked back to her room, Misato caught Shinji blowing a sigh of relief. He went to the stove to cook while Misato took her seat at the table again. After they ate, they all went to their rooms. Asuka had called Hikari to let her know what was going on about the trip. Meanwhile, Shinji was in his room just listening to his cassette player. After a few more hours, both were trying to get some sleep.  
当明日香走回她的房间时，美里看到真嗣松了一口气。他走到炉子旁开始做饭，而美里再次坐回到桌子旁。饭后，他们都回到了各自的房间。明日香打电话给光，告诉她关于旅行的进展。与此同时，真嗣在他的房间里只是听着他的磁带播放器。几个小时后，两人都试图入睡。

*knock* *knock* *敲* *敲*

"Shinji?" Shinji heard a female asking for him as he rubbed his eyes. He looked at his clock, and it was 1 in the morning. He slowly got up and opened the door to see who it was.  
"真嗣？" 真嗣揉着眼睛，听到一个女声在叫他。他看了看时钟，已经是凌晨一点了。他慢慢起身，打开门看看是谁。

"Misato-san?" Shinji rubbed his eyes again. "I was trying to get some sleep. What's wrong?"  
"美里小姐？" 真嗣再次揉了揉眼睛。"我正试着睡觉呢。怎么了？"

"Shinji, I want you to be honest with me." Misato stood there with her arms crossed. "What is going on between you and Asuka?"  
"真嗣，我希望你能诚实地告诉我。" 美里双臂交叉站在那里。"你和明日香之间发生了什么？"

"Wha... what do you mean?" Shinji was now wide awake at her question. He started to sweat like earlier when Misato got up to say something. "Didn't Kaji-san tell you..."  
"什...什么意思？" 真嗣被她的问题惊醒，开始像之前美里起身说话时那样冒汗。"难道加治先生没有告诉你..."

"I know there's more to it than that." Misato cut him off. "I've tried asking Kaji about it, but he keeps getting occupied with other things."  
“我知道事情没那么简单。”美里打断了他，“我试过向加持打听，但他总是被其他事情缠身。”

"_Oh, crap._" Shinji thought to himself.  
“哦，糟了。”真嗣心想。

"I'm sure he wants to tell me whatever it is, but I'm concerned about the both of you." Misato sighed as she placed a hand on Shinji's shoulder. "I know you're a nice person, Shinji, but this is overboard. Will you please tell me why you're acting like this?"  
“我确信他想告诉我那是什么事，但我担心你们俩。”美里叹了口气，把手放在真嗣的肩膀上。“我知道你是个好人，真嗣，但这次太过分了。你能告诉我为什么这样表现吗？”

"It's..." Shinji looked down, trying to find out what he should do. "I'm not sure if I should say anything or not. Especially for Asuka's sake."  
“这……” 真嗣低下头，思索着自己该怎么做。“我不确定是否该说些什么。尤其是为了明日香。”

"Asuka's sake?" Misato raised an eyebrow. "Is she blackmailing you or something?"  
"明日香的事？" 美里挑了挑眉。"她是在敲诈你还是怎么的？"

"No." Shinji immediately looked up at her. "Nothing like that."  
"不是的。" 真嗣立刻抬头看向她。"不是那样的。"

"Then why would you be concerned for..."  
"那为什么你会担心..."

*sniffle* "Momma..." *sniffle*  
*抽泣* "妈妈..." *抽泣*

Misato's eyes shot open as she turned towards Asuka's room and then looked back at Shinji.  
美里睁大了眼睛，转向明日香的房间，然后又看向真嗣。

"Is that Asuka crying?" Misato pointed at Asuka's room while Shinji silently nodded  
"那是明日香在哭吗？" 美里指着明日香的房间，而真嗣默默地点头

### Chapter 7
Shinji and Misato slowly approached Asuka's room and opened the door. Inside, Shinji saw the familiar sight from weeks ago.  
真嗣和美里缓缓走近明日香的房间，打开了门。真嗣看到了几周前熟悉的景象。

"Momma..." Asuka cried, still asleep as she clutched her pillow.  
“妈妈……”明日香哭泣着，依然在睡梦中紧抱着枕头。

"This can't be Asuka." Misato stared at Asuka, keeping her voice down. "I've never heard about this being a problem with her."  
“这不可能是明日香。”美里盯着明日香，压低声音说，“我从没听说过她有这样的问题。”

"Kaji said she's had this problem for years." Shinji looked at Asuka as he slowly got closer to her.  
"加持说这个问题她已经困扰多年了。" 真嗣看着明日香，慢慢地向她靠近。

"What are you doing?" Misato tried to grab him, but he got too far from her grasp. She watched as he climbed into bed with Asuka.  
"你在干什么？" 美里试图抓住他，但他已经离她的手太远了。她看着他爬上床，和明日香躺在一起。

"It's okay." Shinji wrapped an arm around Asuka and leaned towards her ear. "You're not alone, so there's no need to cry."  
"没事的。" 真嗣用一只手臂环抱住明日香，靠近她的耳朵轻声说。"你并不孤单，所以不需要哭泣。"

Shinji stayed there for a few minutes and got Asuka to calm down. She was no longer crying and seemed to be okay now. He sighed as he slowly removed his arm and got up from the bed. He slowly made his way back to the doorway, where eMisato was standing. She motioned to stay quiet, and they closed the door before heading to the kitchen. Misato took a seat while Shinji was standing.  
真嗣在那里待了几分钟，让明日香平静下来。她不再哭泣，现在看起来还好。他叹了口气，慢慢移开手臂，从床上起身。他缓缓走向门口，看到美里站在那里。她示意保持安静，然后他们关上门，前往厨房。美里坐了下来，而真嗣则站着。

"So, that's why you have been acting weird." Misato sighed as she sat her chin in her hands.  
“所以，这就是你行为古怪的原因。”美里叹了口气，用手托着下巴。

"I'm sorry." Shinji looked down to the ground. "Kaji said he was going to tell you, so I thought I didn't need to say anything."  
“对不起。”真嗣低头看着地面。“加持说他要告诉你，所以我想我不需要再说什么了。”

"No, I understand." Misato crossed her arms. "This wasn't something you should deal with, so I know you were only trying to do what you thought was the best."  
"不，我明白。" 美里交叉双臂。"这不是你应该处理的事情，所以我知道你只是想做你认为最好的。"

"Oh, okay." Shinji turned his head to the side.  
"哦，好吧。" 真嗣把头转向一边。"

"For the record, you helping Asuka when she needed help was the right thing." Misato smiled as she looked at him. Shinji looked at her and smiled back.  
"作为记录，你在明日香需要帮助时伸出援手是正确的事。" 美里微笑着看着他。真嗣看着她，回以微笑。"

"Thanks. Kaji told me the same thing."  
"谢谢。加持也跟我说过同样的话。"

"Of course he did." Misato sighed. "Still, this isn't just something we can ignore. Asuka's problem could become a bigger one if we leave it alone."  
"他当然会这么说。" 美里叹了口气。"不过，这事我们不能置之不理。如果放任不管，明日香的问题可能会变得更严重。"

"That's why I was scared to tell you when it first happened."  
"这就是为什么事情刚发生时我害怕告诉你。"

"What do you mean?" Misato raised an eyebrow.  
"你这是什么意思？" 美里挑了挑眉毛。

"Kaji said that Asuka isn't aware of this, and it's not something Asuka would believe if we told her."  
"加持说，明日香对此一无所知，而且就算我们告诉她，她也不会相信。"

"That's true." Misato placed her hand on her head. "That girl has too much pride to admit she has an issue with anything."  
"确实如此。" 美里把手放在头上。"那女孩太过骄傲，绝不会承认自己有任何问题。"

"I mean, I want Asuka to stop that too, but I'm not sure what we can do." Shinji frowned as he looked back at the ground. He started to wonder what would happen if he wasn't there to help Asuka and what would have happened if they did go on the trip. What if Asuka had an episode while on the trip, and the class saw her like that? He was cut off from thinking about that as two hands grabbed his shoulders.  
"我的意思是，我也希望明日香能停止那样，但我不知道我们能做什么。" 真嗣皱着眉头，回头看向地面。他开始思考，如果他不在那里帮助明日香，会发生什么，如果他们真的去旅行了，又会发生什么。如果明日香在旅行中发作了，班上的同学看到她那样怎么办？他正想着这些，突然被两只手抓住了肩膀。

"Let's worry about trying to find a way to help Asuka later." Misato smiled as Shinji looked back at her. "There's not much else we can do tonight, so worrying about it now won't do us any good."  
"我们稍后再想办法帮助明日香吧。" 美里微笑着，真嗣回头看向她。"今晚我们能做的并不多，现在担心也没什么用。"

"I..." Shinji kept starring at Misato.  
"我..." 真嗣一直盯着美里。

"Let's get some sleep, and we can find a way to help Asuka tomorrow." Misato kept smiling as she let go of Shinji's shoulders.  
"我们先睡吧，明天再想办法帮明日香。" 美里保持着微笑，松开了真嗣的肩膀。

"Thank you, Misato." Shinji smiled back at her.  
"谢谢你，美里。" 真嗣对她回以微笑。

"No problem." Misato winked at him. "Asuka may never admit it, but she'd love to know you care about her this much."  
"没事儿。" 美里向他眨了眨眼。"明日香可能永远不会承认，但她会很高兴知道你这么关心她。"

"What?" Shinji blushed as he froze in place.  
"什么？" 真嗣脸红着僵在了原地。

"Oh yeah, she'd love to know how much you care for her." Misato smiled as she put her hands together and leaned her face on them.  
"哦，没错，她肯定想知道你有多在乎她。" 美里微笑着，双手合十，将脸颊靠在手上。

"Why's that?" A sleepy voice came out, making the both of them jump. They both turned to see who that was.  
“怎么了？”一个慵懒的声音传来，吓得两人都跳了起来。他们同时转头看向声音的来源。

"Asuka?" Misato looked over at Asuka, whose hair was a mess. "Why are you up?"  
"明日香？" 美里看向明日香，她的头发凌乱不堪。"你怎么醒了？"

"I was thirsty and wanted some water." Asuka started rubbing her eyes. She reached for a switch and put the lights on.  
"我口渴了，想喝点水。" 明日香开始揉眼睛。她伸手按下开关，打开了灯。

"_Oh, thank god._" Shinji sighed inside of his head.  
"哦，谢天谢地。" 真嗣在心里松了口气。

"So what is Shinji doing that I'd love so much?" Shinji froze again as he heard the question.  
"那么，真嗣在做什么让我会如此喜欢呢？" 听到这个问题，真嗣再次僵住了。

"Oh, that." Misato laughed as she scratched the back of her head. "Well..."  
"哦，那个。" 美里笑着挠了挠后脑勺。"嗯..."

"_We're dead..."_ Shinji thought to himself as he started to sweat.  
"我们要完蛋了..." 真嗣一边想一边开始冒汗。

"Well," Misato sighed as she looked at Asuka. "Shinji was talking about earlier how you can't go on the trip."  
“唉，”美里看着明日香叹了口气，“真嗣之前提到过，你没法去参加这次旅行。”

"Oh?" Asuka raised an eyebrow. Shinji just stood there, still sweating.  
"哦？" 明日香挑了挑眉。真嗣只是站在那里，依旧满头大汗。

"I told him to talk to me after you went to sleep so we could talk. It was supposed to be a surprise, but Shinji wanted some ideas on what to do with you to cheer you up."  
"我告诉他等你睡着后我们再谈，这样我们可以商量一下。原本是想给你个惊喜，但真嗣想听听有什么办法能让你开心起来。"

"Wait, what?" Asuka's eyes shot open as she was wide awake now.  
"等等，什么？" 明日香睁大了眼睛，现在完全清醒了。

"Yep." Misato smiled. "Shinji wanted my advice on where to take a pretty girl like you, so I offered to help give advice."  
"嗯哼。" 美里微笑着。"真嗣想让我给他出主意，带像你这样漂亮的女孩去哪儿好，所以我提议帮忙给点建议。"

"Misato!" Shinji blushed. Asuka was blushing as well, but it was for a different reason.  
"美里！" 真嗣脸红了。明日香也在脸红，但原因不同。

"_He cared enough to ask Misato for help like that?_"  
“他真的在乎到会那样向美里求助吗？”

"Anyways," Misato looked at Asuka. "I told him I had some ideas, but it would be better to ask you what you wanted to do instead. That way, he didn't do the wrong thing if I suggested something you dislike."  
"总之，"美里看向明日香，"我告诉他我有些想法，但最好还是问问你想做什么。这样，如果我提议了你不喜欢的，他就不会做错事了。"

Asuka went from looking at her to looking at Shinji. He was standing there, still blushing.  
明日香从看着她转而看向真嗣。他站在那里，依旧满脸通红。

"Well, I appreciate the thought." Asuka smiled as she crossed her arms. "But you should have just asked me what I like. You would have probably picked something I disliked, and I would have hated it."  
“嗯，你的心意我领了。”明日香微笑着抱起双臂，“但你本该直接问我喜欢什么。你可能会挑到我不喜欢的东西，那我可就讨厌了。”

"I figured as much." Misato sighed. "You should still appreciate Shinji wanting to do something nice like that."  
“我早该料到。”美里叹了口气，“但你还是应该感激真嗣想做这样的好事。”

"I guess you're right." Asuka turned to look at Shinji. "Thank you for thinking about this for me."  
“我想你是对的。”明日香转向真嗣，“谢谢你为我考虑这些。”

"Oh," Shinji looked at her. "Don't mention it."  
“哦，”真嗣看着她，“别客气。”

"Geez, can't you show more emotion?" Asuka sighed as she looked away.  
“天哪，你就不能表现得更有感情点吗？”明日香叹了口气，别过头去。

"Sorry," Shinji mumbled. He saw Asuka turn to look at him, and he jumped as he saw the annoyed look on her face. "I mean, I'm still kind of tired."  
"对不起，" 真嗣咕哝道。他看到明日香转过来看他，看到她脸上的恼怒表情，他吓了一跳。"我是说，我还是有点累。"

"Oh, okay." Asuka yawned. "Can we talk about this tomorrow? I'm also tired."  
“哦，好吧。”明日香打了个哈欠。“我们能明天再谈这个吗？我也累了。”

"Sounds good." Misato waved as she walked back to her room. "Goodnight, you two."  
"听起来不错。" 美里挥着手走回自己的房间。"晚安，你们俩。"

"Night." Both of them waved back. Asuka got some water as she wanted, and Shinji walked back to his room.  
"晚安。" 两人都挥手回应。明日香按自己的意愿喝了些水，而真嗣则走回了自己的房间。

"_That was a close one__._" Shinji thought to himself as he lay on his bed. He eventually drifted off to sleep.  
"真是千钧一发啊" 真嗣躺在床上自言自语。最终，他渐渐进入了梦乡。

### Chapter 8
The following day, Shinji and Asuka were at the dinner table eating breakfast with their guardian. Unfortunately for their guardian, she found sleeping difficult.  
次日清晨，真嗣和明日香与他们的监护人一同坐在餐桌前享用早餐。不幸的是，这位监护人发现入睡变得异常困难。

"How in the world are we going to deal with this?" Misato thought to herself as she looked over at Asuka eating. In truth, she asked herself that question several times while trying to sleep. Eventually, Asuka noticed Misato staring at her.  
“我们究竟该如何应对这种情况呢？”美里暗自思忖，目光扫过正在用餐的明日香。事实上，她在努力入睡时已多次问自己这个问题。最终，明日香察觉到美里正盯着她。

"What?" Asuka swallowed everything in her mouth. "Is there something on my face?"  
“怎么了？”明日香咽下口中的食物，“我脸上有什么东西吗？”

"What...?" Misato shook her head, trying to wake herself up. "I was just thinking about how you thanked Shinji last night."  
"什么...？" 美里摇了摇头，试图让自己清醒过来。"我刚才在想你昨晚感谢真嗣的事。"

"Oh." Asuka looked away. "Well, he tried to make me happy, which I can commend him on."  
"哦。" 明日香移开了视线。"嗯，他努力让我开心，这点我得表扬他。"

"This girl can't stop with the act, can she?" Misato thought as she took a sip from her beer.  
"这女孩真是装个不停，不是吗？" 美里想着，喝了一口啤酒。

"Oh, speaking of," Shinji chimed in. "Are there any ideas on what you'd like to do, Asuka?"  
"哦，说到这个，" 真嗣插话道。"你有想做什么的想法吗，明日香？"

"Hmm." Asuka put her fork down and started to think. Despite hearing about Shinji's idea last night, she still wasn't sure what she wanted to do.  
"嗯。" 明日香放下叉子，开始思考。尽管昨晚听说了真嗣的想法，她仍然不确定自己想做什么。

"Tell you what," Misato got her wallet and pulled out some money. "How bout you two go out and see what's out there to do?"  
"这样吧，" 美里拿出钱包，抽出一些钱。"你们俩出去看看外面有什么好玩的，怎么样？"

"Are you sure, Misato?" Shinji looked over at her.  
"真的吗，美里？" 真嗣转头看向她。

"Since Asuka is still getting used to Japan, maybe she'll find something she wants to do." Misato smiled as she gave Shinji the money. "And since you've been helping with all the cooking and cleaning, on top of piloting the Eva, you can count this as your bonus."  
"既然明日香还在适应日本的生活，或许她会找到自己想做的事情。" 美里笑着把钱递给真嗣。"而且，考虑到你一直在帮忙做饭和打扫，再加上驾驶 Eva，这可以算作你的奖金。"

"Wait, a bonus?" Shinji raised an eyebrow. "Do you mean we get paid?"  
"等等，奖金？" 真嗣挑了挑眉。"你是说我们有薪水吗？"

"You didn't know that?" Asuka giggled as she saw Shinji shake his head.  
"你不知道吗？" 明日香看到真嗣摇头，咯咯笑了起来。

"Shinji doesn't ask for that much, nor seemed interested in being paid in the first place." Misato sighed. "I would have told him sooner if he asked."  
"真嗣并不要求那么多，一开始似乎对报酬也不感兴趣。" 美里叹了口气。"如果他问了，我早就告诉他了。"

"Well, let me just get ready, and we can head out." Asuka got up from the table and walked to her room. As she did, Shinji looked over at his guardian.  
"好吧，让我准备一下，我们就可以出发了。" 明日香从桌旁站起身，走向她的房间。与此同时，真嗣看向了他的监护人。

"Misato, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do." Shinji frowned. "What if Asuka hates everything I try to do while we're out?"  
"美里，我完全不知道该做什么。" 真嗣皱眉道。"万一明日香讨厌我尝试做的每一件事怎么办？"

"Shinji, how did you know to comfort Asuka when you first noticed her issue?" Misato kept her voice down.  
"真嗣，你是怎么知道第一次发现她的问题时要安慰她的？" 美里压低了声音。"

"I don't know." Shinji looked down. "I guess it was just instinct."  
"我不知道。" 真嗣低头说道。"我想那只是本能吧。"

"Well, if they were right back then, they'll probably be right this time." Misato smiled as she pulled out more from her wallet. "Here's a little extra to make up for not telling you sooner you got paid for your work.  
"嗯，如果他们当时是对的，这次大概也会是对的。" 美里笑着从钱包里又抽出一些钱来。"这里多给你一点，算是补偿没有早点告诉你你已经拿到报酬了。"

"Thanks, Misato." Shinji smiled as he took the money.  
"谢谢你，美里。" 真嗣笑着接过钱。

"Okay, I'm ready to go." Asuka walked into the kitchen smiling, wearing the red top and denim shorts she had tried on while she was out with Hikari.  
"好了，我准备好了。" 明日香微笑着走进厨房，穿着她之前和光一起外出时试穿的那件红色上衣和牛仔短裤。

"Oh, trying to impress Shinji with your new outfit, huh?" Misato grinned as Shinji looked away and blushed.  
"哦，想用你的新装扮给真嗣留下深刻印象，是吧？" 美里笑着说，真嗣则转过头去，脸红了。

"What!?" Asuka yelled, jumping back. "As if! I just wanted an excuse to wear this new outfit I got recently!"  
"什么！？" 明日香大喊一声，跳了开去。"才不是呢！我只是想找个借口穿上我最近新买的这套衣服！"

"Yeah yeah." Misato kept grinning.  
"是是。" 美里继续笑着。

"Whatever." Asuka sighed as she looked over at Shinji. "Aren't you going to get ready too?"  
"随便吧。" 明日香叹了口气，转头看向真嗣。"你不是也要准备一下吗？"

"What do you mean?" Shinji got up. "I'm ready now."  
"你什么意思？" 真嗣站起身来。"我现在已经准备好了。"

"You're seriously just wearing your uniform?" Asuka crossed her arms. "Don't you have anything else you wear?"  
“你真的就穿制服？”明日香交叉双臂，“难道你没有别的衣服穿吗？”

"Not really..." Shinji looked down. "I guess I never felt the need to..."  
"不太算吧..." 真嗣低头说道。"我想我从未觉得有必要去..."

"I already have an idea of what we can do." Asuka grabbed Shinji's arm and dragged him out of the apartment.  
"我已经想好我们可以做什么了。" 明日香抓住真嗣的手臂，拉着他走出公寓。

"Ow! Asuka!" Shinji pleaded as he was being dragged. "This hurts!"  
"哎哟！明日香！" 真嗣在被拖着走时恳求道。"这很疼啊！"

"Shut it, baka!" Asuka opened the door.  
“闭嘴，笨蛋！”明日香打开门。

"Have fun, you two." Misato smiled and waved as Asuka pulled him out of the apartment and shut the door. After they left, Misato dropped her smile and reached for her phone. She dialed a number and waited for someone to answer.  
“玩得开心，你们俩。”美里微笑着挥手，看着明日香把他拉出公寓并关上门。他们离开后，美里收起笑容，伸手去拿手机。她拨了一个号码，等待有人接听。

"Hello?" A voice said on the other side.  
“喂？”电话那头传来一个声音。

"Kaji, it's me." Misato sounded stern as she instantly responded.  
"加持，是我。" 美里立刻回应，语气严肃。

"Oh, Katsuragi, good to hear from..."  
"哦，葛城，很高兴听到你的声音..."

"We need to talk about Asuka." Misato cut him off.  
"我们需要谈谈明日香。" 美里打断了他。"

"Hey, it's not my fault she has a crush on me." Kaji laughed. "I'm sure she'll get over it someday, so no need to be jeal..."  
"嘿，她对我有好感可不是我的错。" 加持笑了。"我相信她总有一天会释怀的，所以没必要嫉妒..."

"Shinji told me everything about Asuka." There was a minute of silence once Misato revealed what her call was really about.  
"真嗣把他和明日香之间的一切都告诉了我。" 当美里透露出她这次通话的真正意图后，一阵短暂的沉默笼罩了片刻。

"Just wanted to be sure it was really about that." Kaji sighed. He knew you could never be too careful about some things. "I'll be right over."  
"只是想确认一下是不是真的关于那件事。" 加持叹了口气。他知道有些事情永远不能太过大意。"我马上就到。"

As Misato was having her call with her ex, Asuka was still dragging Shinji.  
当美里在与她的前男友通话时，明日香还在拖着真嗣。

"Asuka!" Shinji was still trying to keep up with Asuka. "Can you at least tell me where you're dragging me!?"  
"明日香！" 真嗣还在努力跟上明日香。"你至少能告诉我你要把我拖到哪里去吗？"

"Look, I'm sick of you always wearing that uniform!" Asuka kept looking forward as she was dragging him. "Everyone else in our class has several outfits, and only you and Wondergirl wear the same thing all the time!"  
“听着，我受够了你总是穿着那身制服！”明日香一边拽着他，一边目不斜视地说，“我们班上其他人都有好几套衣服，就你和那个奇迹女孩天天穿一样的！”

"I mean, I don't wear this to sleep..."  
“我是说，我睡觉时可不穿这个...”

"That's not the point, baka!" Asuka stopped as she turned to look at him. She crossed her arms before continuing. "The point is you should at least look more presentable if you're going to take me out to have fun today. Especially since it's our day off, meaning I don't want to think about school."  
“这不是重点，笨蛋！”明日香停下脚步，转身看向他。她交叉双臂，继续说道：“重点是，如果你今天要带我出去玩，至少应该打扮得体面些。尤其是今天我们放假，我不想想到学校的事。”

"So, what does that mean?" Shinji raised an eyebrow. "If you don't want to be seen with me, why drag me out then?"  
“那么，这是什么意思？” 真嗣挑了挑眉。“如果你不想被人看到和我在一起，那又为何要拉我出来呢？”

"God, you really are dense." Asuka facepalmed. "Look around you."  
"天啊，你真是迟钝。" 明日香捂脸叹息，"看看周围吧。"

Shinji now noticed that Asuka dragged him to the mall. Shinji noticed several people entering since it was the weekend.  
真嗣这才注意到，明日香把他拉到了商场。因为是周末，他看到不少人进出。

"So you want me to take you shopping?" Shinji looked back at Asuka.  
"所以你想让我带你去购物？" 真嗣回头看着明日香。

"No, baka." Asuka sighed. "Right now, we're shopping for you."  
"不，笨蛋。" 明日香叹了口气。"现在，我们是在给你买东西。"

### Chapter 9
"What's taking you so long!?" Asuka stood with her arms crossed, looking at the closed door to a changing room.  
"你到底还要多久！？" 明日香双臂交叉站在那里，盯着更衣室的门。

"Ummm..." Shinji was looking himself over in the window. "I'm not sure about this outfit."  
"嗯……" 真嗣在窗户前打量着自己。"我不太确定这套衣服合不合适。"

"Oh, just show it to me already!" Asuka started banging on the door. "I don't want to waste our whole day having you try on clothes and being too scared to show me!"  
"哎呀，快让我看看！" 明日香开始敲门。"我不想一整天都浪费在你试衣服又不敢给我看上！"

"Okay, okay!" Shinji unlocked the door and opened it. "Here, happy?"  
"好了，好了！" 真嗣解开门锁，把门打开。"这样，满意了吧？"

To say Shinji looked a lot different would be an understatement. Asuka gave him a pair of black jeans and a green t-shirt. She also gave him a thin, sleeveless, zip-up hoodie.  
说真嗣看起来大不一样，实在是轻描淡写。明日香给了他一条黑色牛仔裤和一件绿色 T 恤。她还给了他一件薄薄的、无袖的、带拉链的连帽衫。

"Hmm, not bad" Asuka smiled with her arms crossed. "It's a definite improvement."  
"嗯，不错" 明日香交叉双臂，微笑着。"确实是个明显的进步。"

"Did you really have to pick an outfit based on the colors of my Eva?" Shinji slumped his shoulders and frowned. "You said you don't want to be reminded of school, but now I'm being reminded of piloting the Evas in this."  
"你真的非得根据我 Eva 的颜色来挑衣服吗？" 真嗣垂下肩膀，皱起眉头。"你说不想被提醒学校的事，但现在我穿着这个就想起驾驶 Eva 了。"

"And what's wrong with that?" Asuka glared at him. Shinji jumped back and looked down. After seeing that, she sighed and smiled. "Besides, purple is a good color for you, so I like seeing you in it."  
"那有什么问题吗？" 明日香瞪着他。真嗣往后一跳，低头不语。看到这一幕，她叹了口气，微笑道："再说了，紫色很适合你，我喜欢看你穿。"

Shinji blushed at her comments and looked back up at her. He also saw a blush as Asuka's eyes were now wide.  
真嗣因她的评论而脸红，抬头看向她。他也注意到明日香的眼神变得宽阔，脸上泛起了红晕。

"I didn't mean it like that!?" Asuka stomped her foot.  
"我不是那个意思！？" 明日香跺了跺脚。

"I didn't think that!" Shinji held up his hands in defense.  
"我没那么想！" 真嗣举起双手表示防御。

"Good, because if you did or told anyone that, I'd have to hurt you!" Asuka held up a fist. "Got it!?  
"很好，因为如果你真那么想或告诉了别人，我可得揍你一顿！" 明日香举起拳头。"明白了吗！？

Shinji was too scared to speak, so he just nodded in response. Shortly after, they paid for that outfit and a few others for both of them and left.  
真嗣害怕得说不出话，只是点了点头作为回应。不久后，他们为这套衣服和彼此的几件其他衣物付了款，然后离开了。

"So what's next?" Shinji followed behind Asuka, holding the shopping bags. He had to admit wearing his new outfit felt different than just walking around in his school uniform all the time.  
“接下来去哪儿？”真嗣跟在明日香后面，手里提着购物袋。他不得不承认，穿上新衣服的感觉与整天穿着校服四处走动截然不同。

"Beats me." Asuka kept walking, still looking ahead. "I thought you were treating me today, so don't you have any ideas?"  
“我怎么知道。”明日香继续前行，目光依旧直视前方。“今天不是你请客吗，难道你没什么主意？”

Shinji was trying to think as he continued walking. Sadly, nothing was coming to mind.  
真嗣边走边努力思考。遗憾的是，什么也想不出来。

"Come on." Shinji thought to himself as he sighed. "There must be some idea to name."  
“加油啊。”真嗣叹了口气，自言自语道，“总该有个名字吧。”

Despite not seeing her face, Shinji was starting to worry that it was annoying Asuka that he couldn't name anything. He had a right to be since Asuka was frowning as she waited for an answer. She was about to turn around to say something, but Shinji luckily saw a sign.  
尽管没看到她的脸，真嗣开始担心自己想不出名字会让明日香感到烦躁。他有这样的担忧不无道理，因为明日香正皱着眉头等待他的回答。她正要转身说些什么，但真嗣幸运地看到了一个标志。

"What about karaoke?" Shinji pointed at the sign just as he noticed Asuka turned around, looking like she was about to yell at him. Luckily for him, Asuka stopped and turned to look at the sign.  
"卡拉 OK 怎么样？" 真嗣指着招牌，正好注意到明日香转过身来，看起来像是要对他大喊。幸运的是，明日香停了下来，转头看向招牌。

"Oh, karaoke?" Asuka crossed her arms. "I never tried it before."  
"哦，卡拉 OK？" 明日香交叉双臂。"我以前从没试过。"

"Want to try it today?" Shinji smiled as Asuka turned to look at him. "I haven't tried it before, but it could be fun trying something new together."  
"今天想试试吗？" 真嗣微笑着，明日香转头看向他。"我也没试过，但一起尝试新事物可能会很有趣。"

"I guess." Asuka sighed as she walked towards the karaoke bar. "Guess it's better than waiting for you to come up with something else."  
"我想是吧。" 明日香叹了口气，朝卡拉 OK 酒吧走去。"总比等你再想出别的什么好。"

"Thank god." Shinji thought to himself as he sighed. He started to enjoy avoiding Asuka yelling at him like she usually did. As he followed behind her, he didn't notice their three friends from school looking at them from a distance.  
"谢天谢地。" 真嗣暗自想着，叹了口气。他开始享受起避免明日香像往常那样对他大吼大叫的感觉。跟在她后面，他没注意到学校的三位朋友在远处看着他们。

"Is that Shinji and Asuka," Kensuke pointed toward them while looking through his camera. "Out on a date?"  
"那是真嗣和明日香吗？" 剑介透过相机镜头指向他们。"在约会吗？"

"Seriously?" Touji had his arms crossed. "It must be her dragging him around to be her mule."  
"真的假的？" 托基双臂交叉，"肯定是她在拖着他到处跑，当她的苦力。"

"Both of you stop." Hikari frowned. "Asuka's still my friend, and it's not nice to spy on either of them."  
"你们俩都别说了。" 光皱起眉头，"明日香还是我的朋友，偷窥他们俩都不太好。"

"Asuka sure got dressed up nice if she just wants Shinji as a mule," Kensuke said before Hikari stole his camera. "Hey!"  
"明日香要是只想让真嗣当个苦力，那她打扮得可真够漂亮的，" 健介说道，话音未落，就被光莉抢走了相机。"嘿！"

"Let me see that!" Hikari looked through the camera. Her eyes went wide as she saw what Kensuke was talking about. "That's one of the outfits she tried on with me the other day."  
"让我看看！" 光希透过相机查看。当她看到健介所说的情况时，眼睛瞪得大大的。"那是我前几天和她一起试穿的一套衣服。"

"So what?" Touji raised an eyebrow as he looked at her.  
"那又怎样？" 冬二挑了挑眉，看着她。

"She said that's the perfect outfit for a date when she picked it up." Touji and Kensuke's eyes went wide from looking at Hikari to looking at each other.  
"她当时挑这件衣服时说，这是约会的完美装扮。" 冬二和健介的目光从光希转向彼此，眼睛瞪得大大的。

"I knew I would regret asking Shinji what was going on with him and Asuka." Touji sighed as he frowned. "Now I'm too curious."  
"我就知道问真嗣他和明日香之间怎么了会后悔的。" 冬二皱着眉叹了口气。"现在我太好奇了。"

"Same." Hikari sighed. "Shame we'll be out on that trip, though, and won't know what's going on with them."  
"一样。" 光叹了口气。"可惜我们要去那次旅行，不然就能知道他们怎么了。"

"True, but" Kensuke took back his camera and looked at them. "It's not like the trip is mandatory."  
“确实，但是” 真嗣拿回相机，看着他们。“这趟旅行又不是强制的。”

Touji and Hikari looked at each other before turning to look at Kensuke. Meanwhile, Shinji and Asuka were now inside the karaoke bar.  
冬二和光相互看了一眼，然后转向真嗣。与此同时，真希和明日香已经进入了卡拉 OK 酒吧。

"And if you need anything, such as refreshments, just hit this button and tell us what you'd like." The server was pointing at a device on the wall.  
“如果需要什么，比如饮料，只需按这个按钮告诉我们你想要什么。”服务员指着墙上的一个设备说道。

"Thank you." Shinji was sitting on the couch in a studio next to Asuka, who was now looking through the list of songs.  
“谢谢。”真嗣坐在录音室里的沙发上，旁边是正在浏览歌曲清单的明日香。

"You're welcome." The server waved as she left them alone.  
"不客气。" 服务员挥了挥手，留下他们独自相处。

"Ehh, there are so many songs." Asuka groaned. "How in the world are we supposed to find one to sing?"  
"哎呀，这么多歌。" 明日香抱怨道。"我们到底该怎么选一首来唱啊？"

"Technically, we'll be here for a while." Shinji turned to her, smiling. "I'm pretty sure we'll sing more than one song."  
"严格来说，我们会在这里待上一阵子。" 真嗣转向她，微笑着说。"我敢肯定我们不止唱一首歌。"

"That's not what I meant." Asuka clenched her fist, gritting her teeth. Shinji gulped as he looked away. After a few more minutes, Asuka saw a song she liked and put it in. "I guess this would be good."  
"那不是我的意思。" 明日香紧握拳头，咬紧牙关。真嗣吞了吞口水，移开了视线。又过了几分钟，明日香看到一首她喜欢的歌并播放了它。"我想这应该不错。"

"What did you pick?" Shinji turned back to her.  
"你选了什么？" 真嗣转回来看着她。

"You'll see." Asuka got up and grabbed the mic. She then looked back over at Shinji. "And if you make fun of me, you'll regret it, got it?"  
“你会看到的。”明日香站起身，抓起麦克风。她回头瞥了一眼真嗣，“要是你敢取笑我，你会后悔的，明白吗？”

"I'd never do anything like that to you, Asuka." Shinji sighed.  
“我绝不会对你做出那种事，明日香。”真嗣叹了口气。

"Good." Asuka smiled. "Just wanted to make sure you knew not to do that."  
“很好。”明日香微笑道，“只是想确认你明白别再那么做了。”

She then turned to the monitor and waited for the song to start.  
她随后转向显示器，等待歌曲开始。

### Chapter 10
The song started with a slow piano intro as Asuka closed her eyes and took a breath. Shinji was wondering why she wasn't looking at the screen, but Asuka answered his question as the first lyric hit.
随着明日香闭上眼睛深吸一口气，一曲缓慢的钢琴前奏响起。真嗣很奇怪她为什么不看屏幕。但当第一句歌词响起时，明日香回答了他的问题。

_"__Look into my eyes_

_You will see_

_What you mean to me_

_Search your heart_

_Search your soul_

_And when you find me there_

_You'll search no more."_

As Shinji looked at Asuka, he blushed. He had never heard her sing before, and he couldn't help but love how her voice sounded. Despite saying she'd never done karaoke before, she knew everything, such as the rhythm, volume, and the right note to sing.
真嗣看着明日香，脸红了。他以前从未听过明日香唱歌，但他情不自禁地喜欢上了她的歌声。尽管明日香说她以前从未唱过卡拉 OK，但她对节奏、音量和正确的音符等一切都了如指掌。

_"Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for_

_You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for_

_You know it's true_

_Everything I do_

_I do it for you."_

Once the song was finished, Asuka placed the mic on the mic stand and walked over to the couch.  
一曲终了，明日香将麦克风放回支架上，走向沙发。

"Well, that was fun." Asuka sighed as she smiled. "So what do you have to say about that?"  
"嗯，真有趣。" 明日香叹了口气，微笑着说，"那你对此有什么要说的吗？"

As she turned, she saw Shinji staying quiet, with his face still a little red. She raised an eyebrow before putting her hand into a fist.  
当她转身时，看到真嗣依然安静，脸颊还有些泛红。她挑了挑眉，然后把手握成拳头。

"What!? Something you want to say, baka!?" Asuka cracked her fist, making Shinji jump.  
"什么！？你有什么想说的吗，笨蛋！？" 明日香握拳示威，吓得真嗣一跳。

"Sorry! It's just..." He looked down as he stopped himself.  
"对不起！只是..." 他低头止住了话。

"Just what!?" Asuka grabbed the collar of his hoodie. "Tell me, or else!"  
"只是什么！？" 明日香抓住了他的连帽衫领口。"告诉我，不然你就惨了！"

"I... I never heard you sing before..." Shinji stammered, holding his hands up like he had a gun pointed at him. "And it sounded really good."  
"我... 我以前从没听过你唱歌..." 真嗣结结巴巴地说，双手举起像是有枪指着他。"而且听起来真的很棒。"

"Oh..." Asuka let go of his collar and relaxed. "Well, thanks." Shinji sighed, realizing Asuka wasn't going to kill him after all.  
"哦..." 明日香松开了他的衣领，放松下来。"嗯，谢谢。" 真嗣叹了口气，意识到明日香终究不会杀他。

"By the way, what was that song?"  
"对了，那首歌是什么？"

"It's called, _(Everything I Do) I Do It for You_ by Bryan Adams." Asuka sighed as she leaned back into the couch.  
"那首歌叫《(Everything I Do) I Do It for You》，布莱恩·亚当斯唱的。" 明日香叹息着，向后靠在沙发上。

"I take it it's your favorite." Shinji smiled, still sitting straight up.  
"我猜这是你的最爱吧。" 真嗣微笑着，依旧笔直地坐着。

"I guess you could say that." Asuka smiled, putting her hands behind her head.  
"可以这么说吧。" 明日香微笑着，将双手放在脑后。

"Any certain reason?" "有什么特别的原因吗？"

"Not sure." Asuka slowly opened her eyes and held her chin. To her, the song had just always been a part of her life. All she can say is whenever she hears it on the radio or if it plays in her head, she's happy. "Anyways, your turn to sing."  
"不确定。" 明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，托着下巴。对她来说，这首歌早已是她生活的一部分。她只能说，每当在收音机里听到它，或是它在脑海中响起时，她都会感到快乐。"总之，轮到你唱了。"

"Oh." Shinji frowned. "But, I don't even know what to sing."  
"哦。" 真嗣皱起眉头。"可是，我连唱什么都不知道。"

"Just pick something, you moron." Asuka turned her head to look at him. "You didn't see me having trouble when I picked a song to sing."  
"随便选一首啊，笨蛋。" 明日香转头看向他。"我选歌的时候可没见我为难。"

Shinji sighed as he thought for a moment. Only one song came to his mind, so he decided to put that in and walk up to the mic.  
真嗣叹了口气，思索片刻。脑海中只浮现出一首歌，于是他决定放那首歌，然后走向麦克风。

"What did you pick?" Asuka raised an eyebrow as she sat straight up.  
“你选了什么？”明日香挑起眉毛，坐直了身子。

"You'll see" Shinji smiled, trying to look confident for Asuka. However, his stammering made it clear to Asuka that he was nervous.  
“你等着看吧。”真嗣微笑着，试图在明日香面前显得自信。然而，他的结巴让明日香清楚地看出他很紧张。

The song _Fly Me To The Moon_ by Frank Sinatra started playing. Shinji tried his best to sing it, but he was nowhere near as good as Asuka. Not only was he singing off-key, but his timing would be way off. With each word that showed up, he would go from high to low with his voice, like he was searching for the right note. After a minute, he started to cough as he stressed out his voice. Thankfully, the song was a little over a couple of minutes long. Once it was done, he sat the mic down and ordered a glass of water.  
弗兰克·辛纳屈的《Fly Me To The Moon》开始播放。真嗣尽力去唱这首歌，但他远不及明日香唱得好。不仅音准不对，节奏也完全乱了。每个词出现时，他的声音从高到低起伏不定，仿佛在寻找正确的音符。一分钟后，他开始咳嗽，因为嗓子过度用力。幸运的是，这首歌只有几分钟长。结束后，他放下麦克风，点了一杯水。

"*Cough* I guess I suck at this. *cough*" Shinji tried to drink water to soothe his throat.  
“*咳嗽* 我想我不擅长这个。*咳嗽*” 真嗣试图喝水来缓解喉咙。

"I wouldn't say it was that bad." Asuka looked away and put her hand on her face.  
“我不会说那么糟糕。” 明日香转过头，用手遮住脸。

"That's nicer than I *cough* expected." Shinji felt like his throat was burning.  
"那比我想象的*咳*要好多了。" 真嗣感觉喉咙像在燃烧。

"What's that supposed to mean!?" Asuka crossed her arms as she got up.  
"那是什么意思！？" 明日香交叉双臂站了起来。

"I just thought you'd be bragging now." Shinji took another sip of water. "Like how you're the better singer, and I'm horrible."  
"我只是以为你现在会自夸呢。" 真嗣又喝了一口水。"就像你唱得比我好，而我糟糕透顶。"

"How dare you! I don't do that all the..." Asuka stopped herself as she thought back to what Shinji had said. Whether it was piloting the Eva, her grades, or even video games, Asuka would always brag about how she was superior. Not just to Shinji but to anyone she beat at anything. She took a deep breath before speaking to Shinji. "What I mean is, it was your idea to come, and I wanted to be nice since you told me how good my singing was."  
“你怎么敢！我可不是那种……” 阿斯卡突然打住，回想起真嗣之前的话。无论是驾驶 Eva、成绩，还是电子游戏，阿斯卡总是夸耀自己的优越。不仅是对真嗣，任何她赢过的人她都会如此。她深吸一口气，然后对真嗣说：“我的意思是，是你提议来的，而且你说过我唱歌很好听，我想表现得友善些。”

"Oh." Shinji just stared at her. "Well, I'm sorry for thinking you'd insult me."  
"哦。" 真嗣只是盯着她。"好吧，我为以为你会侮辱我而道歉。"

"Apology accepted." Asuka smiled as she put in another song. "You may want to skip the next few with how your voice currently sounds."  
"道歉接受。" 明日香微笑着又放了一首歌。"照你现在的嗓音，可能想跳过接下来的几首。"

"Probably a good idea." Shinji coughed again and drank his water.  
“大概是个好主意。” 真嗣又咳嗽了一声，喝了口水。

They spent another hour at the karaoke bar before deciding to leave. Asuka took over the whole time, which Shinji didn't mind since his throat was still sore. They were now outside and walking around.  
他们在卡拉 OK 酒吧又待了一个小时，然后决定离开。明日香全程掌控，真嗣并不介意，因为他的喉咙仍然疼痛。现在他们已经在外面散步。

"We'll have to try that again sometime." Asuka smiled. "It was more fun than I was expecting."  
“我们得找个时间再试试。” 明日香微笑着说，“比我想象的要有趣多了。”

"Hopefully, I don't lose my voice again." Shinji's looked down and sighed. He was talking better, but it still felt like his throat was on fire.  
"希望这次我的声音不要再消失了。" 真嗣低头叹息，他的话音有所改善，但喉咙依旧像火烧一样难受。

"You just need to practice, Baka." Asuka turned to look back at him. "Which I'd help with."  
"你只需要多练习，笨蛋。" 明日香转头看向他。"我会帮忙的。"

"You'd do that?" Shinji looked up at her.  
"你会这么做吗？" 真嗣抬头看着她。

"I mean," Asuka turned away at first, feeling a blush. She then turned back. "I mean, if I'm going to go to karaoke regularly from now on, the least I could do is teach you how to sing so I can get a break."  
"我的意思是，" 明日香一开始转过身去，脸上泛起红晕。随后她又转了回来。"我的意思是，如果我以后要经常去唱卡拉 OK，至少我可以教你唱歌，这样我也能休息一下。"

"Well, no matter the reason, I appreciate your wanting to help." Shinji smiled, actually feeling better for a moment.  
"嗯，不管出于什么原因，我都很感激你愿意帮忙。" 真嗣微笑着，那一刻确实感觉好多了。"

"Yeah, yeah." Asuka rolled her eyes, smiling to hear him say that. "Anyways, what now?"  
"是啊，是啊。" 明日香翻了个白眼，听到他这么说，她笑了。"那么，现在怎么办？"

"How bout we go eat somewhere?" Shinji rubbed his belly. "We didn't have that much for breakfast."  
"我们去哪儿吃点东西吧？" 真嗣揉了揉肚子。"我们早餐没吃多少。"

"That's true." Asuka mimicked him by rubbing her belly as well. "I take it you know a place?"  
"确实。" 明日香也模仿他揉了揉肚子。"你是知道个地方吧？"

"Of course." Shinji smiled as he turned and pointed. "It's down this way.  
"当然。" 真嗣笑着转身指路。"往这边走。"

"Good. I trust you with food since that place you suggested for pizza was delicious." Asuka smiled as she followed hm.  
“很好。我相信你的推荐，毕竟你提议的那家披萨店味道确实不错。”明日香微笑着跟在他身后。

**A/N: Another chapter for everyone who's been checking out my story. Thought I'd change it up and drop a few facts about the story at the end of this chapter.  
作者的话：为一直关注我故事的朋友们献上新一章。这次我想换个方式，在本章末尾透露一些关于故事的细节。**

**1. The Bryan Adams song was chosen because it hit Number 1 in a particular country. I'll let you try to find out which that was.  
1. 选择布莱恩·亚当斯的这首歌是因为它在某个国家登顶了排行榜第一名。我会让你试着找出是哪个国家。**

**2. Frank Sinatra's version of Fly Me To The Moon was actually a coincidence. I forgot what I looked up. Something about songs and vocals related to bass, and that song came up.  
2. 弗兰克·辛纳屈的《带我飞向月球》版本其实是个巧合。我忘了自己查的是什么了，大概是与低音相关的歌曲和演唱，结果那首歌就出现了。**

**3. I'm naturally a bass singer, so that's why I was looking at that.  
3. 我天生是低音歌手，所以才关注那方面。**

**4. I've also stressed out my throat from singing, which does suck if you ever had that happen to you from singing too much or not warming up.  
4. 我也因唱歌而使喉咙过度疲劳，如果你曾因唱得太多或未充分热身而遇到这种情况，确实会很糟糕。**

### Chapter 11
"And that's as much as I know." Kaji took a sip of his coffee after explaining everything to his former lover.  
"这就是我所知道的一切。" 加治在向他的前恋人解释完一切后，喝了一口咖啡。

"And you decided to wait when it came to telling me about this?" Misato glared at him with her arms crossed.  
"而你决定在告诉我这件事上等待？" 美里交叉双臂，瞪着他。

"I wanted to, but certain things came up." Kaji noticed Misato was still glaring at him and raised his hands in defense. "It's the truth, Misato. I had every intention of telling you myself, but I couldn't get around to..."  
"我确实想告诉你，但有些事情发生了。" 加治注意到美里仍在瞪着他，便举起双手表示防御。"这是真的，美里。我本有意亲自告诉你，但我一直没能找到机会..."

"I don't mean that, you moron!" Misato raised her voice as she slammed her hands on the table and stood up. "Why didn't your dumbass tell me this before Asuka got here!?"  
"我不是那个意思，你这个白痴！" 美里提高嗓门，双手猛拍桌子站了起来。"你这个蠢货为什么不早点告诉我，在明日香来之前！？"

"I know you're going to hate this answer," Kaji put his arms down. "I was hoping this issue went away."  
"我知道你会讨厌这个答案，" 加持放下手臂。"我原本希望这个问题会自行消失。"

"What do you mean went away?" Misato raised an eyebrow.  
"你说的'消失'是什么意思？" 美里挑起眉毛。

"The last time Asuka had that happen before coming here was over a year ago." Kaji sighed. "I figured Asuka grew out of it, and I didn't have to worry about it. I didn't expect it to just come back out of the blue."  
“上次明日香出现这种情况还是在来这里之前，已经过去一年多了。”加持叹了口气，“我以为她已经长大了，不会再有这种事，没想到突然又冒出来了。”

"I still think you should have told me from the start." Misato lowered her voice and sat back down. "It also would have been better than forcing Shinji into this predicament."  
“我还是觉得你一开始就应该告诉我。”美里压低声音，重新坐下，“这样也比把真嗣卷入这种困境要好。”

"Which I also feel bad about too." Kaji frowned. While Shinji did help Asuka, he knew it wasn't something Shinji should have been forced into. "Believe me. I never intended to have him dealing with something that was my job."  
“对此我也感到很抱歉。”加持皱眉，尽管真嗣帮助了明日香，但他知道这不是真嗣应该被迫面对的事情，“相信我，我从未想过让他处理本该是我的职责的事情。”

"I believe you." Misato sighed as she crossed her arms. "Despite being an ass, you seem to care about Shinji."  
"我相信你。" 美里叹了口气，双臂交叉。"尽管你是个混蛋，但你似乎很关心真嗣。"

"He's a good kid." Kaji smiled. "He reminds me of myself sometimes."  
"他是个好孩子。" 加持微笑道。"有时候，他让我想起我自己。"

"Hopefully, he's better with girls than you." Misato squeezed the bridge of her nose.  
"希望他在女孩子方面比你强。" 美里捏了捏鼻梁。"

"Oh, I'm sure Asuka will have the same complaints as you when she gets older." Kaji laughed, making Misato's face turn red.  
"哦，我敢肯定明日香长大后也会有和你一样的抱怨。" 加持笑着说，让美里脸红了。

"I swear I will shoot you one of these days." Misato clenched her fist as he continued to laugh. She took a breath before continuing. "Anyways, like I told Shinji, we can't ignore this. It's bad enough he's already involved in it, but we can't depend on him to always help Asuka when she gets like that."  
"我发誓总有一天会开枪打你。" 美里握紧拳头，他继续笑着。她深吸一口气，然后继续说道："总之，就像我告诉真嗣的那样，我们不能忽视这一点。他已经卷入其中已经够糟糕了，但我们不能总是依赖他在明日香那样的时候帮助她。"

"I know, and I think I might have some ideas on how to help Asuka." Kaji smiled. "Thankfully, they can't go on their trip, which might give us an opening to help Asuka."  
"我知道，我想我可能有些主意来帮助明日香。" 加持微笑着说，"幸好他们不能去旅行，这可能给我们一个帮助明日香的机会。"

"And what are these ideas you have?"  
"那你有什么想法呢？"

While Misato and Kaji were discussing how to help Asuka, she and Shinji had just finished their meal. The sun was now close to setting, and the two were unsure what to do next.  
当美里和加持讨论如何帮助明日香时，她和真嗣刚刚吃完饭。太阳即将落山，两人不确定接下来该做什么。

"Well, I have to hand it to you." Asuka rubbed her belly as they were walking. "You have a gift when it comes to delicious food."  
"好吧，我得承认。"他们走路时，明日香揉着肚子说，"你在做美味的食物方面确实有天赋。"

"I'm happy to hear that." Shinji smiled as he walked by her side. "I take it you've really enjoyed going out today."  
"听到这个我很高兴。" 真嗣微笑着走在她身边。"看来你今天真的玩得很开心。"

"Well, it's not as good as going on a trip." Asuka sighed as she put her hands behind her head. She smiled before continuing. "But I appreciate you doing your best to cheer me up."  
"嗯，虽然比不上旅行。" 明日香叹了口气，双手枕在脑后。她微笑着继续说道。"但我很感激你尽力让我开心。"

Shinji just smiled as he heard Asuka complain and then compliment him. While Asuka could still be rough with him, he started to see a kinder side to her as he talked to her more. However, he frowned as he thought about Asuka's problem and realized he still didn't know much about her.  
真嗣听到明日香先是抱怨，然后又称赞他，只是笑了笑。尽管明日香对他仍有些粗鲁，但随着交谈的增多，他开始看到她更温柔的一面。然而，当他想到明日香的问题时，他皱起了眉头，意识到自己对她了解得还不够多。

"What's wrong?" Shinji snapped back to his senses and turned over to look at Asuka. "You looked gloomy all of a sudden. Don't tell me you're upset you didn't cheer me up more."  
"怎么了？" 真嗣猛地回过神来，转过身看向明日香。"你突然一脸阴沉。别告诉我你是因为没让我更开心而生气。"

"No, it's not that." Shinji looked down.  
"不，不是那样的。" 真嗣低头说道。

"Well, spit it out already." Asuka stopped as she turned completely towards him and placed her hands on her hips. Shinji stopped as well.  
"那就快说出来。" 明日香转身面向他，双手叉腰停了下来。真嗣也停住了。

"You really want to know the truth?" Shinji sighed as he turned to face her.  
“你真的想知道真相吗？” 真嗣叹了口气，转身面对她。

"Yes, you baka, I literally just told you to tell me." Asuka kept staring at him.

"Fine." Shinji took a breath. "The truth is that I..."  
"好吧。" 真嗣深吸了一口气。"事实是，我……"

As Shinji looked at Asuka, he didn't see the typical redhead that yelled at him to do whatever she wanted. He saw Asuka looking concerned. Instead of her glare, she frowned as she looked at him with her eyes wide open. She also didn't have a fist clench like whenever she would threaten him. He also realized that when Asuka told him to spit it out, she didn't yell at him like whenever she ordered him around.  
当真嗣看着明日香时，他看到的并非那个惯常的红发女孩，总是对他大吼大叫，要求他做这做那。他看到的是一脸关切的明日香。她的眼神不再锐利，而是皱着眉头，睁大了眼睛注视着他。她的手也没有像往常威胁他时那样紧握成拳。他还意识到，当明日香让他有话直说时，她并没有像平时命令他那样对他大喊大叫。

"Well?" Asuka chimed in, making Shinji snap back to his senses again. "What's the truth?"  
"那么？" 明日香插话道，让真嗣再次回过神来。"真相是什么？"

Shinji took a breath before continuing.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，继续说道。

"The truth is, I had a lot of fun today, and I'm sorry that I couldn't make you enjoy it more than you would have enjoyed that trip."  
事实上，我今天玩得很开心，很抱歉没能让你享受到比那次旅行更多的乐趣。

"Oh." Asuka sighed as she looked at him. "Well, like I said, I..."  
"哦。" 明日香叹了口气，看着他。"好吧，就像我说的，我……"

"I'm not done." Asuka's eyes shot open as Shinji interrupted her.  
"我还没说完。" 明日香的眼睛突然睁大，因为真嗣打断了她。

"Did he just..." Asuka thought to herself as she kept looking at Shinji.  
"他刚刚是...？" 明日香心里想着，目光依旧停留在真嗣身上。

"I realized I got lucky with a lot of the stuff we did. Chances are this would have ended badly, and that's mostly cause I don't know you outside of school and piloting the Eva."  
“我意识到我们在很多事情上都挺幸运的。很可能这会以糟糕收场，主要是因为除了在学校和驾驶 Eva 之外，我对你一无所知。”

"So what?" Asuka raised an eyebrow. "I still had fun, so what's it matter if..."  
“那又怎样？”明日香挑了挑眉。“我玩得开心不就好了，管它呢……”

"That's why I want to get to know you more, Asuka." Shinji put his hand to his chest. "The real you."  
“这就是为什么我想更多地了解你，明日香。” 真嗣将手放在胸前，“真正的你。”

"Wha... what do you mean the real me?" Asuka stuttered as her face blushed.  
“什...什么意思，真正的我？”明日香结巴着，脸颊泛起红晕。

"I mean, who you are outside of the Eva and school." Shinji lowered his hand as he took another breath. "I want to know who you are outside of that so I don't have to rely on luck to try to cheer you up in the future."  
“我是说，你在 Eva 和学校之外的身份。”真嗣放下手，又深吸了一口气。“我想了解那个你，这样将来我就不必靠运气来尝试让你开心了。”

There was silence between them for a few minutes. In Shinji's head, he was scared to death, wondering if Asuka would kill him for saying this. However, Asuka's head was in complete shock.  
他们之间沉默了几分钟。在真嗣的脑海中，他害怕得要命，不知道明日香会不会因为他说这话而杀了他。然而，明日香则完全陷入了震惊之中。

"The real me?" Asuka thought as she looked down. "No one's ever told me they wanted to know the real me..."  
“真正的我？”明日香低头沉思，“从来没有人对我说过他们想了解真正的我...”

"Asuka?" It was Asuka's turn to be snapped back to reality by Shinji. "Are you okay?"  
"明日香？" 这次轮到明日香被真嗣拉回现实。"你还好吗？"

"Yeah..." Asuka sighed. "Just..."  
"嗯..." 明日香叹了口气。"只是..."

"Just what?" Shinji raised an eyebrow.  
“什么意思？” 真嗣挑了挑眉。

"Just..." Asuka took a breath before putting on her typical smile. "I'm just happy that you realized you don't know me and are smart enough to ask me to tell you about my great life."  
"只是..." 明日香深吸了一口气，然后挂上了她惯常的笑容。"我只是很高兴你意识到你不了解我，并且足够聪明地问我关于我精彩生活的故事。"

Shinji sighed as he looked down, thinking it was pointless.  
真嗣叹了口气，低头看着地面，觉得这一切毫无意义。

"If it helps you make me happy, then I have no problem telling you things about me." Asuka smiled and held her hands up.  
"如果这能帮你让我开心，那我毫不介意告诉你一些关于我的事。" 明日香微笑着举起双手。

"Wait, really?" Shinji looked up at Asuka.  
"等等，真的吗？" 真嗣抬头看向明日香。

"Of course." Asuka grabbed his wrist. "Now that we have that settled, let's head back."  
"当然。" 明日香抓住他的手腕。"既然已经决定了，我们回去吧。"

"Oh, okay." Shinji sighed as he started walking with Asuka. He smiled as she walked before him, still holding his wrist. Mostly she did that to hide a similar smile on her face.  
"哦，好吧。" 真嗣叹了口气，开始和明日香一起走。他笑着看她走在前面，依然抓着他的手腕。她这么做主要是为了掩饰自己脸上相似的微笑。
