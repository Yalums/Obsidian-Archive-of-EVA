Disclaimer- No, the wonderful Evangelion series is not mine.  
免责声明- 不，这部精彩的 EVA 系列并非我所拥有。

A lone figure stands at the edge of the ocean, glancing down at a marker, the only tribute to his progenitor. Unruly raven hair that is beginning to get in his eyes as it whips in the wind, saddened midnight blue eyes stare at the stone.  
一个孤独的身影站在海边，低头看着一块纪念碑，这是对他先人的唯一纪念。不羁的乌黑头发在风中狂舞，开始遮挡他的视线，忧郁的深蓝色眼睛凝视着那块石头。

For the stretch of a few moments, the soft crashing of waves is the only sound.  
有那么一会儿，只有海浪轻柔的拍打声回荡在耳边。

Then, Shinji Ikari, Third Child and the boy who held the fate of Humanity in his grasp, begins to speak.  
随后，碇真嗣，第三适格者，那个曾紧握人类命运的少年，开始说话。

"Hello Father... its been a year since I last came." Of course, his father is not truly interred here, just as the grave markers a few meters back do not hold and bodies. This is merely a shell, something to keep the memories tangible.  
“父亲，您好……距离我上次来访已有一年。”当然，他的父亲并未真正安息于此，正如几米外那些墓碑下并无遗体一样。这不过是一个空壳，一种让记忆变得有形的手段。

He does not know why he comes every year, on this day, the day of Third Impact and the Instrumentality of Man. It is not for fond reminiscence or love, but out of...  
他不明白为何每年都要在这一天来此，这一天，既是人类补完计划之日。并非出于美好的回忆或爱意，而是出于……

Even that is unknown. 甚至连这一点也未曾明了。

But as the years roll on, as the task of rebuilding humanity wears, and his dependence on Asuka's companionship waxes, he begins to understand. He comes to an understanding that other children have encountered.  
但随着岁月流逝，随着重建人类的任务日益沉重，他对明日香陪伴的依赖逐渐加深，他开始理解了。他逐渐领悟到其他孩子也曾遇到过的那种理解。

Bit by bit, he understands his father.  
一点一滴，他开始理解他的父亲。

"I... I think I understand you a little more this time too." He chokes out slowly, every word tearing itself from his heart. It is difficult to admit, difficult to admit sympathy for this devil of a man.  
“我……我想这次我也更理解你一些了。”他缓缓哽咽道，每个字都像是从心底撕扯出来。承认这一点很难，承认对这个男人产生同情更难。

A man who abandoned a child, his own flesh and blood, at the moment when Shinji needed a father, a pillar of strength the most. A man who recalled his son in order to use as an instrument, a weapon in a war. A man who, by all accounts, attempted to destroy his son's heart, soul, and mind.  
一个在真嗣最需要父亲、最需要坚强支柱的时刻抛弃了自己亲生骨肉的男人。一个为了利用儿子作为战争中的工具、武器而召回他的男人。一个据称试图摧毁儿子心灵、灵魂和思想的男人。

Nay... no man could do such things. Only a heartless demon.  
不……没有人能做出这样的事。只有无情的恶魔。

And yet... wasn't this, this Instrumentality, this Apocalypse, this Eden... wasn't this so one man could see his wife again?  
然而……这不就是为了一个能再次见到他妻子的机会吗？这不就是那个所谓的统一、末日、伊甸园吗？

The lines blurred, and such a selfish and yet loving reason nearly justified the madness of Gendo Ikari.  
界限变得模糊，这样一个自私却又充满爱的理由几乎为碇源堂的疯狂正名。

"You wanted to see mother again... wanted it so badly you were willing to damn mankind for it." Shinji whispered softly, eyes fixed on the meaningless marker. "You needed her... needed her to keep you sane, to keep you from losing yourself... to make you who you are." They are as much for him as they are for his father.  
“你想再次见到母亲……渴望到愿意为此诅咒全人类。”真嗣轻声低语，目光紧锁在那无意义的标记上。“你需要她……需要她来保持理智，不让你迷失自我……让你成为现在的你。”这些话对他自己和对他的父亲同样重要。

He paused, unsure if these words are true, but nonetheless continues. "I understand that now... I understand..."  
他停顿了一下，不确定这些话是否真实，但仍然继续说道：“我现在明白了……我明白了……”

And it is true. The days of bitter, childish fighting with the German redhead are over, first set aside by a mutual need to survive, then out of companionship... and now Shinji knows they are heading into somewhere new, frightening, and ultimately beautiful.  
事实确实如此。与那位德国红发少女幼稚而激烈的争吵日子已经结束，起初因共同生存的需要而搁置，随后出于友谊……如今，真嗣明白他们正步入一个崭新、令人畏惧却又最终美好的境地。

The Third Child knows the name of this feeling, but knows that this creature cannot be named, not yet, and cannot be spoken. But words are mere sounds, and this feeling is beyond sound and beyond touch.  
第三适格者知晓这种感觉的名字，但明白这生灵尚不能被命名，亦无法言说。然而，言语不过是声音，而这种感觉超越了声音，超越了触感。

He knows other feelings for the Second Child. Care, protectiveness, and immense gratitude.  
他对第二适格者怀有其他情感。关怀、保护欲以及深深的感激之情。

The reason is simplistically elegant.  
原因简单而优雅。

If it was not for Asuka, then he would never have found his will to survive.  
如果不是因为明日香，他永远不会找到生存的意志。

The day is clear in his mind, though the exact time is unknown, save it was shortly after they arrived on the beach.  
那一天清晰地印在他的脑海中，尽管确切的时间已无从知晓，只知道那是在他们到达海滩后不久。

Despair, torrents of it had drowned him in sorrow and misery. Everything, Kaoru, Rei, Touji, Misato, the loss of everything he had known and the events of the waning days of 2015 were a tormenting miasma on his mind. As that drifted, the terrible knowledge of the crimes his father had done were upon him.  
绝望，如洪流般将他淹没在悲伤与痛苦之中。一切，薰、丽、真嗣、美里，他所熟悉的一切的失去，以及 2015 年末那些日渐消逝的日子里的种种事件，都成了他心头折磨人的瘴气。随着这些思绪飘散，他父亲所犯下的可怕罪行也压在了他的心头。

Rei... a clone of his mother and an Angel, a shell for a soul, his father's keystone for his insane plans.  
丽……他母亲的克隆体，一个天使，灵魂的空壳，他父亲疯狂计划的关键。

The Dummy Plug and the Commander's own knowledge of everything that had happened.  
Dummy Plug（替身插头）和司令对所发生一切的了解。

All these and more, all these sins of the father bore down on the son like a Biblical flood to wash his existence away.  
这一切以及更多，这些父辈的罪孽如圣经中的洪水般压在儿子身上，要将他的存在彻底冲刷殆尽。

Step by step, at first unknowingly and then purposefully, he had walked his way to the limitless ocean, where waves seemed hungry tongues ready to swallow him up.  
一步一步，起初不知不觉，而后有意为之，他走到了无垠的海洋，那里的波浪仿佛饥饿的舌头，随时准备将他吞噬。

_Just end it,_ something had whispered softly, like a siren's song, singing its dirge of doom from the gates of the Netherworld.  
就这样结束吧，有个声音轻柔地低语，如同塞壬的歌声，从冥界之门传来，吟唱着毁灭的挽歌。

As his foot touched the waves however, a slight tug on his shirt stayed him.  
然而，当他的脚触碰到波浪时，衬衫上轻微的拉扯让他停了下来。

Behind him, the hollowed shell that was once the vibrant, vivacious Second Child whispered pitifully, "Don't go." The words, though soft as a butterfly's kiss, had the impact of Adam.  
在他身后，那个曾经充满活力、生机勃勃的第二使徒的空壳，可怜兮兮地低语着，“别走。”尽管这话语轻柔如蝴蝶的吻，却有着亚当般的冲击力。

Swallowing, he could only reply hoarsely, "Why?"  
他咽了咽口水，只能嘶哑地回应，“为什么？”

Her shining locks in the dying sun veiled her face from view, and although Asuka would never admit to it, Shinji swore that a single tear had fallen down her face. She responded in the quietest, meekest tone possible, "I need you."  
夕阳的余晖中，她闪耀的发丝遮住了面容，尽管明日香永远不会承认，但真嗣发誓看到她脸上滑落了一滴泪。她用尽可能轻柔、温顺的语气回应，“我需要你。”

Three words. 三个字。

That shouldn't have undone hundreds, thousands of other words and deeds. Words of hatred-  
这三个字本不应抵消数百、数千其他的话语和行为。那些充满恨意的话语——

"_I HATE YOU! I HATE EVERYTHING!"_  
"我恨你！我恨一切！"

words of scorn- 轻蔑的话语——

"_Such a boring little boy."_  
"真是个无聊的小男孩。"

words of deception, spoken by others-  
他人所言的欺骗之词——

"_I mean, I love you."_  
"我的意思是，我爱你。"

And more, words of laughter, words of pain, so many words that should not have been undone by three. Faces blurred, visages that urged him, beckoned him to the sweet finality of death.  
还有更多的，欢笑之言，痛苦之语，如此多的言语本不该被三言两语所消解。面容模糊，那些催促他、召唤他走向甜美死亡终局的容颜。

Kaoru, his words that brought bliss and then agony.  
薰，他的话语先是带来极乐，随后却是无尽的痛苦。

Father, dismissing him as a tool and a person.  
父亲，将他视为工具和人一样轻易打发。

Rei- the new one, not THE Rei- quietly and coldly talking to him.  
新来的丽，并非那个丽，静静地、冷冷地与他交谈。

Asuka, scorning him, mocking him.  
明日香，蔑视他，嘲弄他。

That should never have been enough to stop this tide.  
那本不应足以阻止这股浪潮。

But somehow, those words stayed the death wish.  
但不知为何，那些话语留住了死亡的愿望。

It was enough. 这样就足够了。

Someone still needed him.  
还有人需要他。

As long as she needed him, it would be enough.  
只要她还需要他，这就足够了。

Nodding, the Third Child stepped away from the waves and back towards his companion.  
第三子点点头，从波涛中退开，回到他的同伴身边。

Without her that day, without her every day, every morning, it would be impossible to go on. It scared him.  
没有她，那天没有她，每一天，每一个早晨，他都无法继续。这让他害怕。

What frightened him even more was what he would do to get her back. Anything. Any cost would be cheap if he could have her back. The crimes his father committed seemed petty to that determination.  
更让他恐惧的是，为了找回她，他愿意付出什么。任何代价。如果能让她回来，任何代价都显得微不足道。他父亲所犯的罪行在这份决心面前显得微不足道。

"Was this how you felt, Father? Were you frightened of losing mother, and then that determined to regain her?" the similarities were too great, and the feeling too repugnant at first. It took years for him to become accustomed to feeling sympathy for the devil.  
"父亲，您当时是这样的感觉吗？害怕失去母亲，然后又决心要找回她？" 相似之处太过明显，最初的感觉令人厌恶。他花了多年时间才习惯对恶魔产生同情。

No, he could never forgive and condone what his father had done, but he could accept it. He could sympathize with it.  
不，他永远无法原谅和纵容父亲所做的一切，但他可以接受。他可以对此表示同情。

"Shinji?" her voice has mellowed, softened into a tone like music.  
"真嗣？" 她的声音变得柔和，宛如音乐般悦耳。

Armageddon will do that to people.  
世界末日就是会让人有这种感觉。

Swallowing, and whispered too softly for anyone but himself to hear, Shinji said, "Until next year. Goodbye father."  
咽了咽口水，真嗣轻声低语，声音轻到只有他自己能听见：“明年见。再见了，父亲。”

Then he turned, and with a content smile, walked back to Asuka, who waited with open arms and her own gentle smile.  
然后他转身，带着满足的微笑，走向等待着他的明日香，她张开双臂，脸上挂着温柔的微笑。

Sometimes, if put in the correct light, the actions of monsters can seem acts of love.  
有时，若置于恰当的光下，怪物的行径看似亦是爱的举动。

Sometimes, love does make one do crazy things, but one commits insanity to regain it.  
有时，爱情确实会让人做出疯狂之事，但人们也会为重获爱情而陷入疯狂。

Sometimes, one can feel sympathy for the devil.  
有时，人们会对魔鬼产生同情。

### Comment
[Malistroph](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1783842/Malistroph): Most people think that Gendo is a monster. I like that in this story, you didn't do this. It was very lovely that Shinji in the end understood that without pillars of people around him like Asuka, he would have lost it. Very well done.
大多数人都认为玄道是个怪物。我喜欢你在这个故事中没有这样做。最后，真嗣明白了没有明日香这样的支柱在身边，他就会失去自我，这一点非常可爱。写得很好。

[Linkin-Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/578289/Linkin-Phoenix): These really are great, you do a great job of convaying Shinji the way he should be, but Asuka... mellow, hey look the sky is falling (No offence)Anyway, It's great,这些作品真的很棒，你很好地塑造了真嗣应有的形象，但明日香......很圆润，嘿，看天都要塌下来了（无意冒犯）

vicwow: this is a great fic. i am in awe of this fic. very few one shots of eva capture emotion like this without being the ultimate pit of angst. this is amazing. thank you
我对这篇小说感到敬畏，Eva 的单镜头很少能捕捉到这样的情感，而又不至于让人陷入极度的焦虑之中。
