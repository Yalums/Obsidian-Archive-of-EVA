**Condolence and Comfort 哀悼与慰藉**

"You fool." Misato cries, her knees going weak as she leans forward, pushing the dinning room table with the telephone on it forward. "You were always such a fool." Misato say as she cries further.  
“你这个傻瓜。” 惣流哭泣着，双膝发软，身体前倾，推动着放有电话的餐桌。“你总是这么傻。” 惣流哭泣着说。

In his room, Shinji takes his ears phones out as he hears Misato's brake down.  
在房间里，真嗣听到惣流的崩溃声，摘下了耳机。

Stepping out of his room, he sees Misato crouched down, and leaning against the table. The site of her like that stirs a series of confusing emotions in Shinji.  
走出房间，他看到美里蹲在地上，倚靠着桌子。她这副模样在真嗣心中激起了一连串复杂的情感。

First, it was confusion, not knowing what was wrong. Then it was a small impulse to go comfort her, feeling how much he cared for her. But that was immediately over come by a crippling lack of understanding of how to make her feel better.  
起初是困惑，不明白发生了什么。随后涌起一股想要安慰她的冲动，感受到自己对她的关心。但这种冲动立刻被一种无力的不理解所取代，他不知道如何才能让她感觉好些。

Shinji had no clue what Misato was going through, and could not think of how he could make her feel better, he imagined her crying and yelling at him for how stupid his was for trying to understand what she was going through.  
真嗣完全不知道美里正在经历什么，也想不出如何让她感觉好些。他想象着她哭泣并对他大吼，责怪他试图理解她的痛苦是多么愚蠢。

At this thought, Shinji backed away into his room, feeling sick at himself for not being able to help Misato feel better.  
想到这里，真嗣退回自己的房间，对自己无法帮助美里感到难受而感到恶心。

It did not get much better for anyone after that.  
那之后，情况对任何人都没有好转。

---

One of the few times Misato talked to Shinji was to ask him where Kaji's plaint was so she could take care of it. Misato became so depressed she started working longer hours, and when she was at home, she spent most of the time drunk.  
美里很少和真嗣交谈，有一次是为了询问加持的诉状在哪里，以便她可以处理。美里变得非常沮丧，开始工作更长时间，而在家时，大部分时间都在醉酒中度过。

All this made Shinji feel even worse. Feeling that he should be able to do something for Misato. But he could not figure out what.  
这一切让真嗣感觉更糟了。他觉得自己应该能为美里做些什么，但却想不出具体能做什么。

One day, only a few days after Kaji was reported missing, Shinji woke up to get ready for school. He and Asuka had gotten into the habit of waking themselves up, as Misato was leaving for work before they woke up most days. Shinji had gotten dressed and was making breakfast for himself and Asuka when Asuka came out of her own room. The two sat down and eat in silence.  
就在葛城报告失踪几天后的一天，真嗣醒来准备去上学。他和明日香已经养成了自己醒来的习惯，因为美里大多数日子在他们醒来之前就已经去上班了。真嗣穿好衣服，正在为自己和明日香做早餐时，明日香从自己的房间走了出来。两人默默地坐下吃饭。

Shinji realized that he and Asuka hadn't really talked much since Kaji disappeared, but he can't bring himself to talk to her right now.  
真嗣意识到自从葛城失踪后，他和明日香几乎没有怎么交谈过，但他现在也无法鼓起勇气和她说话。

They finished breakfast without even making eye contact.  
他们吃完早餐，甚至没有对视一眼。

---

School went by in a blur and they are back home, but Misato is still not there.  
学校的一天匆匆而过，他们已经回到家中，但美里仍然没有回来。

It is a few hour before they figured she will be late getting home, latter then usual that is.  
过了几个小时，他们才意识到她会比平时晚回家。

Shinji makes himself and Asuka dinner which they eat without talking to each other.  
真嗣为自己和明日香准备了晚餐，两人默默无言地吃着。

It is a bit later when Shinji is trying to do his homework when her hears something.  
稍晚些时候，真嗣正尝试做作业，这时他听到了一些声响。

Removing his ear phones, he hears crying.  
他摘下耳机，听见了哭泣声。

Shinji steps out of his room and looks into the living room and sees Asuka softly crying with her face in the sofa cushions.  
真嗣走出房间，望向客厅，看到明日香正轻声哭泣，脸埋在沙发垫中。

This reminds Shinji of Misato, and it brings back all the same feelings, Shinji is about to turn around and go back to him room until her remembers how horrible it felt turning his back on Misato like that, and how she'd been since then.  
这让他想起了美里，所有的情感再次涌上心头，真嗣正要转身回房，却突然记起当初那样背对美里是多么难受，以及她自那以后的变化。

Not wanting to feel that way again, Shinji goes to Asuka and tries to get her attention.  
不愿再次体验那种感觉，真嗣走向明日香，试图引起她的注意。

"Asuka...Asuka?" "明日香...明日香？"

Asuka hears her name and stops crying. She looks up, still glassy eyed and sees Shinji looking at her.  
明日香听到自己的名字，停止了哭泣。她抬起头，眼神依旧迷离，看见真嗣正注视着她。

It is now that Shinji realizes that he still does not know how to comfort someone feeling this way.  
此刻，真嗣意识到自己仍然不知道如何安慰这样心情的人。

"Asuka, are feeling alright?" Shinji feels dumb for asking that question.  
"明日香，你还好吗？" 真嗣觉得自己问这个问题很愚蠢。

Asuka doesn't seem to like it that much either as her eyes tear up again and she tells Shinji to go.  
明日香似乎也不太喜欢这样，她的眼睛再次泛起泪光，让真嗣离开。

"Go, just go away, like all the rest." Asuka says as she put her face back into the couch cushions.  
"走吧，就像其他人一样，走开。" 明日香说着，把脸埋进了沙发垫里。

Shinji is actually slightly relived, as it was not the as angry as he expected Asuka to be at having been seen in this state. But his relief soon turned to more sadness as he realizes this means Asuka is so depressed that she isn't even acting like herself.  
实际上，真嗣感到有些宽慰，因为明日香并没有他预想中那么愤怒，毕竟被看到这副模样。但他的宽慰很快又转为更深的悲伤，因为他意识到这意味着明日香已经沮丧到连自己的本性都不再表现出来。

Not wanting to just give up on her he tries again.  
他不想就这样放弃她，于是再次尝试。

Sitting down, on the other end of the couch from Asuka, Asuka doesn't seem to notice, or care.  
他坐下，在沙发另一端远离明日香，而明日香似乎没有注意到，或者根本不在乎。

Looking over at Asuka, Shinji thinks about what to say next. 'All these started when Kaji disappeared.'  
望向明日香，真嗣思索着接下来该说什么。'这一切都是从加持先生失踪开始的。'

"Asuka, is this about Kaji?" Shinji asks as politely as he could.  
"明日香，这是关于加持先生的事吗？" 真嗣尽可能礼貌地问道。

Hearing Kaji's name seemed to get Asuka to stop crying. She sits up and looks over at Shinji.  
"听到加持的名字，似乎让明日香停止了哭泣。她坐起身来，看向真嗣。

He thinks he's gotten through to her until she says. "No, I'm crying for reasons completely unrelated to the fact that the one other mature person in my life is gone, and no one has any idea what happened to him, and I am now stuck with no one but a alcoholic bimbo, and a baka child in my life!" Asuka snaps at Shinji, clearly letting out just a small amount that her feelings on to him.  
他以为自己已经说服了她，直到她说道：“不，我哭是因为完全无关的原因，我生命中另一个成熟的人消失了，没有人知道他发生了什么，现在我身边只剩下一个酗酒的轻浮女人和一个愚蠢的小孩！”明日香对真嗣怒吼，显然只是稍微向他透露了一点自己的感受。

Shinji finds his fear coming true, realizing that Asuka, having a worse temper then Misato, is going to go harder on him.  
真嗣发现自己的恐惧成真了，意识到明日香脾气比美里更糟，将会对他更加严厉。

"I...I...I'm sorry." Shinji feebly says.  
“我...我...我很抱歉。”真嗣无力地说道。

'There he goes again, apologizing for everything.' Asuka angrily thought to her self. 'And Kanji thought he had potential.'  
'他又来了，对什么都道歉。' 明日香生气地想。'而健二还以为他有潜力。'

"Oh, do you have to apologize for everything!?" Asuka raises her voice, getting closer to Shinji. "Say as much dumb shit as you want, but whatever you do, you don't have to follow everything with a 'I'm sorry'!" Asuka yells, raising a open hand, then she slaps Shinji across the face.  
“哦，你是不是对什么都得道歉！？” 明日香提高声音，逼近真嗣。“说多少蠢话都行，但不管你做什么，都不必每次都跟着一句‘对不起’！” 明日香喊着，举起一只手，然后一巴掌打在真嗣脸上。

This leaves Shinji a little stunned. While Asuka feels a twinge of regret over it herself, but does her best not to show it.  
这让真嗣有些愣住。而明日香自己也有一丝后悔，但她尽力不表现出来。

Shinji rubs the hand print on his cheek as is begins to fade. Asuka turns away from him curls up, resting her face on her knees.  
真嗣揉着脸颊上逐渐消退的手印。明日香转过身去，蜷缩起来，将脸埋在膝盖上。

Shinji is about to leave, but he feels like he owes Asuka one more attempt to reach her.  
真嗣正要离开，但他觉得应该再尝试一次与明日香沟通。

Taking a deep breath, he begins. "I..."  
深吸一口气后，他开始说道：“我……”

'Here we go again.' Asuka thought, thinking she was getting another unneeded apology.  
'又来了。' 明日香心想，以为又要收到一个不必要的道歉。

"I miss Kaji to" Shinji says.  
“我也想念加持先生。” 真嗣说道。

This surprised Asuka. Causing her to turn and look at Shinji with some curiosity. "What?"  
这让明日香感到惊讶，她转过身来，带着几分好奇地看向真嗣。“什么？”

"I said I miss Kaji to."  
"我说我也想念加持先生。"

Still kinda surprised, Asuka goes on. "I didn't think you cared about him all that much?"  
明日香仍然有些惊讶，继续说道：“我没想到你这么在乎他？”

"Why wouldn't I?" "我为什么不会呢？"

"Well, you where hardly ever around him, or talked about him, and you usually side with Misato on things, and she didn't seem to care about him all that much either."  
"嗯，你几乎从不在他身边，也不怎么提起他，而且你通常都站在美里那边，她似乎也不怎么在乎他。"

"That's not true, Misato thought about Kaji all the time. The two of them just had a complicated relationship."  
"那不是真的，美里其实一直在想着加持。他们俩的关系就是比较复杂。"

"Yeah, I guess if I had a past with someone like that, I would act kinda weird to." Asuka says, Shinji is inwardly thrilled that she is speaking to him in something other then a cry, or a shout.  
"是啊，我想如果我和某人有那样的过去，我可能也会表现得很奇怪。" 明日香说道，而真嗣内心激动，因为她终于不是在哭泣或大喊，而是正常地和他说话了。

"So then, What did you like about Kaji?" Asuka asked.  
"那么，你喜欢加持哪一点？" 明日香问道。

Wanting to keep this conversation going, Shinji answers. "I liked how confident he was. He always seemed like he knew everything" Shinji said, happily remembering the times he spoke with Kaji.  
为了继续这个话题，真嗣回答道："我喜欢他那种自信。他总是给人一种无所不知的感觉。" 真嗣开心地回忆起与加持交谈的时光。

Asuka smiles, it seemed Shinji finally said something she could agree with. "Yeah, he never let anyone talk down to him, and always seemed like the smartest person in the room.  
明日香微笑着，似乎真嗣终于说出了她能认同的话。"是啊，他从不容许别人轻视他，总是显得房间里最聪明的人。

"Hey, do you remember the first time you meant him?" Asuka asked, enjoying talking about Kaji with someone who liked him as well.  
"嘿，你还记得第一次遇见他的时候吗？" 明日香问道，享受着与同样喜欢加持的人谈论他的乐趣。

"Aboard the Over The Rainbow? Yeah I remember. "He asked me how well Misato's been sleeping, like she and I shared a bed."  
"在‘彩虹之上’号上？嗯，我记得。"他问我美里睡得好不好，好像我和她同床共枕似的。"

Asuka laughs a bit at that. "I bet you blushed like crazy at that?"  
明日香对此轻笑一声。"我打赌你当时脸红得厉害吧？"

"Actually no, I laughed at the question to. Like I said, I liked how confident he was."  
"其实不然，我对这个问题也笑了。就像我说的，我喜欢他那种自信的样子。"

"Well, it seems he returned the favor. Kaji always loved telling me how well you where doing with your synch rate." Asuka says.  
"看来他也回报了这份关心。加持总是喜欢告诉我你的同步率提升得有多好。" 明日香说道。

"Sorry about that." Shinji said, knowing how sensitive that subject could get with Asuka.  
"抱歉。" 真嗣说道，他知道这个话题对明日香来说有多敏感。

"Don't be, I know he wasn't trying to rub anything in my face, he was just trying to keep me motivated." Asuka says. Then she looked dreamily at the floor, clearly remember something fondly, probably for the first time since Kaji disappeared.  
"别担心，我知道他不是故意要刺激我，他只是想激励我。" 明日香说道。随后她梦幻般地望着地板，显然是在深情地回忆着什么，这或许是自加持消失以来的第一次。

"He really did know how to talk to people didn't he?" Said Shinji.  
"他真的很会和人交流，不是吗？" 真嗣说道。

"Yeah, he did. "是的，他确实很会。

"You know, maybe if you told NERV how well you two got along, they might have let the two of us stay with Kaji as our guardian?" Asuka says  
"你知道吗，如果你告诉 NERV 我们俩相处得有多好，他们或许会让卡吉成为我们俩的监护人呢？" 明日香说道

"Then again, it was probably best we didn't. He would've spend a lot of time trying to set you and me up." Asuka says out of nowhere.  
"不过话说回来，可能不那样也好。他肯定会花很多时间试图撮合你和我。" 明日香突然冒出这么一句。

"W...What" Shinji asked, blushing a bit at Asuka's last statement.  
"什...什么？" 真嗣问道，听到明日香最后那句话，脸上泛起了一丝红晕。

Liking seeing how Shinji reacted, Asuka continued. "Oh yeah, Kaji had this weird thing about teasing me that I secretly had a crush on you." Asuka said looking down again, not letting Shinji she her eyes. "Some how, Kaji got it into his head that I was only mean to you because I was madly in love with you and didn't know how to express myself." Turning her face away from the floor Asuka said. "If you ask me, I think he may have just been projecting his relationship with Misato on to us. What do you think?" Asuka asks, looking at Shinji with a small smile on her face.  
看到真嗣的反应，明日香继续说道：“哦对了，加持先生有个怪癖，总爱逗我，暗示我暗恋你。”明日香再次低下头，不让真嗣看到她的眼睛。“不知怎么的，加持先生认定我对你刻薄，是因为我疯狂地爱着你，却不知道如何表达。”她转过脸，不再看地面，说道：“要我说，我觉得他可能只是把和美里小姐的关系投射到了我们身上。你怎么看？”明日香问着，脸上带着一丝微笑，看向真嗣。

"Ahh...What do I think about what?" Shinji asks.  
“啊……我怎么想？”真嗣问道。

"Why do you think that Kaji thought you and I should have gotten together?"  
“为什么你觉得加持先生认为我们应该在一起？”

"Ah, I don't know, maybe he thought we would make a cute couple?" Shinji's face turns red at what he just said. "Ouch" Shinji says as Asuka pinches his check.  
"啊，我不知道，也许他认为我们会是一对可爱的情侣？" 渚薰的脸因为自己刚说的话而泛红。"哎哟"，渚薰说道，因为明日香掐了他的脸颊。

"That we would make a cute couple, is that what you think Kaji thought, or what you think yourself?" Asuka mockingly asks.  
"我们看起来会是一对可爱的情侣，这是你认为加持先生想的，还是你自己这么认为的？" 明日香嘲讽地问道。

"Ow ow ow, I'm sorry Asuka, it's not what I think, it's not what I think."  
"哎哟哎哟哎哟，对不起明日香，不是我这么想的，不是我这么想的。"

Asuka liked this, she had been sad for a while, she was desperate to talk to someone about Kaji, she never thought it would be Shinji, but he seemed to want to be a sympathetic ear for her, and she could always make sure she had the upper hand in their relationship. Letting go of his check, Asuka said. "It's OK Third, I know what you meant, and since we're being honest, it's not that bad of a thought." Asuka said with a knowing smile.  
明日香喜欢这样，她已经难过了一段时间，她迫切地想和某人谈谈加持，她从未想过那个人会是真嗣，但他似乎愿意成为她的倾听者，而且她总能确保在这段关系中占据上风。松开他的脸颊，明日香说道：“没关系，三号，我明白你的意思，既然我们坦诚相待，这个想法其实也不算太糟。”明日香带着会心的微笑说道。

'What did she just say?' Shinji though 'Is she saying she DOSE think we would make a cute couple?' Shinji didn't know what to do, he expected some issues, but he never thought Asuka would open up this soon. Did she really only need someone to talk to.  
“她刚才说什么？”真嗣心想，“她是说她真的认为我们能成为一对可爱的情侣吗？”真嗣不知所措，他预料到会有一些问题，但没想到明日香这么快就敞开心扉。她真的只是需要一个倾诉的对象吗？

"I'm not saying I AM in love with you, but we could make a 'cute couple' if I were." Asuka said.  
"“我不是说我真的爱上了你，但如果我是，我们确实可以成为一对‘可爱的情侣’。”明日香说道。

"And where's my say in this?" Shinji angrily asked, rubbing the sore spot on his check.  
"在这件事上我的意见呢？" 真嗣愤怒地问道，揉着脸颊上的痛处。

"I think we both know you wouldn't turn me down if I gave you the chance." Asuka smugly says, striking a suggestive post on her side of the couch.  
"我想我们俩都知道，如果我给你机会，你是不会拒绝我的。" 明日香得意地说道，在沙发的一侧摆出一个挑逗的姿势。

"Weren't you the one who pressured me into giving you a kiss that time?" Shinji is shocked by what he just said. He wasn't sure what had gotten into them, Asuka was flirting with him, and he was standing up to Asuka.  
"难道不是你那次逼我亲你的吗？" 真嗣对自己刚说的话感到震惊。他不确定是什么让他们这样，明日香在挑逗他，而他正在对明日香反抗。

Fearing he may have gotten Asuka angry at him, Shinji gets a nervous face and just stars forward. He doesn't notice as Asuka crawls over to him, puts her lips near his ear and whispers. "I'm sorry I said you were a bad kisser."  
"担心自己可能惹恼了明日香，真嗣紧张地脸色一变，只是直视前方。他没有察觉到明日香悄悄爬到他身边，将嘴唇贴近他的耳朵，轻声说道：“对不起，我说你接吻技术不好。””

"W...What?" Shinji asked.  
"“什...什么？”真嗣问道。”

"I said I'm sorry I said you were a bad kisser.  
"“我说，对不起，我说你接吻技术不好。”

"I know I made a big show of washing my mouth out, but is was just supposed to be a joke that I got carried a way with."  
"我知道我夸张地漱了口，但那只是个玩笑，我一时兴起就演过头了。"

"Being grossed out enough to wash your mouth out dose seem a bit to far." Shinji says, trying to convey how hurt he was by her 'act' back then.  
"因为恶心到要漱口，这似乎有点过头了。" 真嗣说道，试图传达她当时的'表演'让他感到多么受伤。

Looking away, Asuka blushes a bit, and says. "Yea, it was wasn't it, I don't know how to explain it.  
阿苏卡转过头去，脸上泛起一丝红晕，说道："是啊，确实有点，我不知道该怎么解释。

"It was just going to be a bit of a tease, but then...You know what it's like when you feel like you've gotten yourself into more then you can handle?"  
"这本来只是想逗弄一下，但后来...你知道那种感觉，当你觉得自己陷入了一个难以应付的局面时？"

"Yeah I do." Shinji felt that way when ever he fought a Angle, which Asuka seemed to handle pretty well. Yet Asuka felt overwhelmed by a kiss?  
"嗯，我懂。" 每当真嗣与使徒战斗时，他都会有这种感觉，而明日香似乎处理得相当不错。然而，一个吻就让明日香感到不知所措？

Shinji couldn't wrap his mind around any of it. First Asuka was a wrack, then they were talking like best friends, then she teased and flirted with him, and now she's acting like being around him makes her weak in the knees.  
真嗣完全无法理解这一切。起初明日香崩溃了，然后他们像最好的朋友一样交谈，接着她开始逗弄和调情，现在她又表现得好像在他身边就腿软。

"Asuka?" He gets her attention.  
“明日香？”他引起了她的注意。

Asuka looks at Shinji, but he couldn't tell what she was feeling.  
明日香看向真嗣，但他无法判断她的情绪。

Asuka sits up on her knees closer to Shinji and looks into his eyes, Shinji is feeling nervous again.  
明日香跪着靠近真嗣，直视他的眼睛，真嗣再次感到紧张。

They are staring into each other's eyes when Asuka moves herself closer and begins to pucker her lips.  
他们正凝视着对方的眼睛，这时明日香挪近了身子，开始撅起嘴唇。

Their lips are just a inch apart when the front door suddenly opens.  
两人的唇瓣仅一寸之遥时，前门突然打开了。

The two of them look over to the door way to see Misato stepping into the apartment.  
他们俩转头望向门口，只见美里踏进了公寓。

"Hay kids." She half-heatedly greets Shinji and Asuka. "Sorry I was late, I've had a lot of work with Ritsuko lately." She says as she makes her way to the fridge, not even looking at Shinji and Asuka.  
"嗨，孩子们。" 她半心半意地向真嗣和明日香打招呼。"抱歉我来晚了，最近和律子有很多工作。" 她说着走向冰箱，甚至没有看真嗣和明日香一眼。

Taking a few beers out, Misato asks. "So you two doing homework together?"  
拿出几瓶啤酒，美里问道："你们俩是在一起做作业吗？"

"Yeah, that's it." Asuka say in a fast voice. Shinji looks over to see that she's blushing.  
"对，就是这样。" 明日香快速地说道。真嗣转头一看，发现她脸红了。

"That's good to hear." Misato lazily says as she takes the beers into her room. Pan-Pan following in toe.  
"听到这个真好。" 惣流懒洋洋地说着，把啤酒拿进她的房间。小潘紧随其后。

Shinji looks over at Asuka who is staring at the floor again, still blushing.  
真嗣看向明日香，她再次盯着地板，脸上依旧泛着红晕。

After some awkward silence, Asuka just gets up and says "Good night." And walks to her room, without looking back at Shinji.  
经过一段尴尬的沉默后，明日香站起来，只是说了句"晚安。"然后走向她的房间，没有回头看真嗣一眼。

After a little while Shinji heads to bed himself.  
过了一会儿，真嗣自己也去睡觉了。

As he's lying down to sleep he thinks about the conversation he just with Asuka. It was the most honest conversation they had ever had, but what Shinji couldn't stop thinking about was what Asuka was going to do right before Misato came in.  
躺下准备睡觉时，他回想起刚刚与明日香的那番对话。那是他们之间最坦诚的一次交谈，但真嗣无法停止思考的是，在美里进来之前，明日香正打算做什么。

"Was she really going to...?" Shinji blushes at the thought and tried to go to sleep, but has a hard time at it.  
“她真的打算……？”想到这里，真嗣脸红了，试图入睡，却难以入眠。

Meanwhile Asuka was up late, doing some hard thinking of her own.  
与此同时，明日香也熬夜未眠，独自陷入深思。

---

The next day was pretty uneventful.  
第二天倒是相当平淡无奇。

Again, Misato left for work before either Shinji or Asuka woke up. And Shinji made the two of them breakfast.  
一如往常，美里在真嗣和明日香醒来之前就出门上班了。而真嗣则为两人准备了早餐。

The only difference was that Asuka did try to strike up a conversation with Shinji.  
唯一的区别是，明日香确实试图与真嗣展开对话。

"So, how'd you sleep last night?" Asuka asked, pushing her eggs around with her fork.  
“那么，你昨晚睡得怎么样？”明日香问道，用叉子拨弄着她的鸡蛋。

A little surprised that Asuka talked to him Shinji just said. "Ah, OK I guess."  
真嗣对明日香主动搭话感到有些惊讶，只是回答道：“啊，我想还可以吧。”

"That's good." Asuka said, blushing a bit as she turned her attention back to her meal, it seemed she wanted to say something else, but couldn't get the words out at that moment.  
"挺好的。" 明日香说着，脸上泛起一丝红晕，她将注意力转回餐食上，似乎还想说些什么，但那一刻却没能说出口。

It wasn't until they had both eaten and her were on their way out to head to school that Asuka spoke to Shinji again.  
直到两人都吃完饭，准备出门去学校时，明日香才再次对真嗣开口。

"Hay, about last night... Takes for taking with me about Kaji." Asuka said, not looking right at Shinji as they waited at the door. "I know it probably didn't seem like much, but you where the first person who really seemed to get Kaji like I did." Asuka said, then she looked at Shinji with a kind of half-smile, and gave him a quick hug before heading out the door, Shinji following close behind, smiling to himself.  
"嘿，关于昨晚...谢谢你和我聊起加持。" 明日香说，并没有直视真嗣，他们站在门口等待。"我知道可能看起来没什么，但你是第一个真正像我一样理解加持的人。" 明日香说完，半带微笑地看向真嗣，快速地给了他一个拥抱，然后走出门口，真嗣紧随其后，心中暗自微笑。

Shinji had a great day at school, knowing that he helped Asuka feel better lifted a huge weight on of his shoulders.  
真嗣在学校度过了愉快的一天，得知自己帮助明日香感觉好些了，他感到肩上的重担减轻了许多。

Meanwhile at NERV, Misato and Ritsuko were discussing a project Misato volunteered to help out on.  
与此同时，在 NERV 总部，美里和律子正在讨论一个美里自愿参与的项目。

"Are you sure you want to help with this, you've been spending a lot of time at work recently." Ritsuko said to Misato. "What about Shinji and Asuka, how much of them have you seen recently?"  
“你确定要参与这个项目吗？你最近工作时间太长了。”律子对美里说，“那真嗣和明日香呢，你最近见过他们多少次？”

"Do you want to extra help of not." Misato answered back. "And besides, the kids are doing just fine, when I came home last night they were working on their homework together."  
"你想不想额外帮忙。" 碇真嗣回答道，"而且，孩子们做得很好，昨晚我回家时，他们正在一起做作业。

Ritsuko knew what Misato was doing, she was trying to keep herself busy since Kaji disappeared. She didn't want to call her out on it, because she didn't want to deal with Misato's emotions right now, so she decided to accept Misato's help.  
律子知道美里在做什么，自从加持消失后，她一直在努力让自己忙碌起来。她不想揭穿她，因为她现在不想处理美里的情绪，所以她决定接受美里的帮助。

"OK, but at least tell Shinji and Asuka that you won't be home for a while, so they don't worry."  
"好吧，但至少告诉真嗣和明日香，你暂时不会回家，这样他们就不会担心了。"

"Fine." Misato said as she took out her cell phone.  
"好的。" 碇真嗣说着，掏出了自己的手机。

---

When Shinji and Asuka got home, they found a massage on the answering machine.  
当真嗣和明日香回到家时，他们发现答录机上有一条留言。

"Hey, Shinji and Asuka." Misato's voice began, sounding disinterested. "Just calling to let you know that Ritsuko really needs my help on a big project, so I won't be making it home until pretty late, so feed yourselves, and Pan-pan, and don't wait up, OK bye." Misato's massage ended.  
"嘿，真嗣和明日香。" 美里开始说道，声音显得有些漫不经心。"只是打电话告诉你们，律子有个大项目需要我帮忙，所以我今晚要很晚才能回家，你们自己弄点吃的，也给潘潘喂食，不用等我了，拜拜。" 美里的留言结束了。

"Well, that's just typical of her by now." Asuka said, crossing her arms as she faced away from the phone with her eyes closed. "She's been looking for any excuse to stay away from home lately, I bet she actually begged Ritsuko to let her help her out"  
"唉，她现在就是这样。" 明日香说着，双臂交叉，背对着电话，闭上了眼睛。"她最近一直在找借口不回家，我敢打赌她其实是恳求律子让她帮忙的。

Shinji didn't have much to say, he just stared at the answering machine, thinking about how accurate Asuka's guess sounded, and feeling that same sense of guilt he'd been feeling about Misato lately.  
真嗣没什么可说的，只是盯着答录机，思考着明日香的猜测听起来多么准确，同时感受到近来对美里同样的愧疚感。

"Well, it doesn't matter much anyway I guess." Asuka continued. Turning around to talk to Shinji. "We've been doing most of the work around here lately, at least now we have some peace and quit.  
"嗯，不管怎样，这也没什么大不了的。" 明日香继续说道，转过身来和真嗣说话。"最近这里大部分工作都是我们做的，至少现在我们能有些清静了。

"Come on, maybe we can get our homework out of the way before we eat." Asuka said as she emptied out her backpack on to the living room table.  
"来吧，或许我们可以在吃饭前把作业搞定。" 明日香说着，将背包里的东西一股脑倒在客厅的桌子上。

Shinji turned away from the phone and found himself noticing that Asuka was actually acting friendly to him.  
碇真嗣挂断电话，注意到明日香竟然对他表现出了友好。

Happy about this, Shinji walked over and kneeled next to Asuka.  
对此感到高兴的碇真嗣走过去，跪坐在明日香旁边。

As he got out his own books and other school stuff, Asuka was saying. "We should start with Social Studies, so turn to chapter..." Asuka was cut off when she and Shinji reached for the same pencil and touched hands. Asuka, in a knee-jerk reaction, pulled her hand away, and quickly hid the blush on her cheeks.  
当他拿出自己的书本和其他学校用品时，明日香说道：“我们应该从社会学开始，所以翻到……”话未说完，她和真嗣同时伸手去拿同一支铅笔，手指相触。明日香本能地缩回手，迅速掩饰住脸颊上的红晕。

She cleared her throat with a cough and turned back to Shinji with a straight face. "Like I said, we should turn to chapter 15. Let's get started." Asuka said, like nothing happened.  
她清了清嗓子，咳嗽一声，然后面无表情地转向真嗣。“就像我说的，我们应该翻到第 15 章。我们开始吧。”明日香说道，仿佛什么都没发生过。

They got there homework done, feed Pan-pan, and eat dinner without incident.  
他们完成了作业，喂了潘潘，然后平静地吃了晚餐。

It wasn't until later that night after Shinji was finished showering and brushing his teeth for the night, and was on his way to his room for bed, that something happened.  
直到那天深夜，真嗣洗完澡、刷完牙，正准备回房间睡觉时，才发生了一些事情。

Shinji found Asuka standing in the hallway, looking thoughtful, but also a little nervous. Shinji was about to ask what was wrong when she asked. "Can we talk Shinji?"  
真嗣发现明日香站在走廊里，看起来若有所思，又带着些许紧张。他正要问发生了什么，她却先开口了：“我们可以谈谈吗，真嗣？”

"S...sure." Shinji answers.  
“嗯...当然。”真嗣回答道。

The two of them sit on the couch like they did the night before. Asuka is the first to talk.  
两人像前一晚那样坐在沙发上。明日香首先开口。

"Shinji, about last night, I really didn't thank you enough.  
“真嗣，关于昨晚，我真的没有好好感谢你。”

"You see, like I said, I though Kaji was the only person in the world that understood me. And I was worried that with him gone, I would be all alone again."  
“你看，就像我说的，我以为在这个世界上只有加持先生理解我。我担心他离开后，我又会孤单一人。”

'Again?' Shinji thinks. '又来？' 真嗣心想。

"But then you got up the nerve to talk to me, even though how mean I had been to you, and that I even slapped you across the face right there, you still listened to me." Asuka finishes, looking at Shinji with glassy eyes.  
"但是后来你鼓起勇气和我说话，尽管我对你多么刻薄，甚至在那里我还打了你一巴掌，你仍然听我说。" 明日香说完，用湿润的眼睛看着真嗣。

"W...well of course I listened to you. I could tell you needed it."  
"嗯...当然我听你的。我能感觉到你需要这样。"

"That's right, you could tell what I needed. It's like Mr. Kaji always told me, if I just gave you a chance, you would show me just how much you understood me. Anyone else would have walked away, but you didn't give up on me." Asuka said, as she still stared at him with a smile.  
"没错，你能察觉到我需要什么。就像卡吉先生常说的，只要我给你一个机会，你就会向我展示你有多了解我。换作别人早就离开了，但你没有放弃我。" 明日香说着，依旧微笑着凝视着他。

"Of course I didn't give up on you, you're my friend." Shinji reassuringly said.  
"我当然不会放弃你，你是我的朋友。" 真嗣安慰地说道。

"It's not just that." Asuka continued, now looking down on to the floor. "You see, my mother died a while ago, and my Dad was out of the picture for a awhile before that, so after Mama was gone, I was alone, no one talked to me about anything other then piloting, or never asked my how I felt about anything.  
"不仅仅是那样。" 明日香继续说道，目光转向地面。"你看，我母亲去世有一段时间了，而我父亲在那之前就已经不在我身边了，所以妈妈走后，我就孤单一人，除了驾驶之外，没人跟我谈其他事情，也没人问过我对任何事情的感受。

"Until Kaji was assigned to watch over me. He was the smarted, kindest, and most handsome man I've ever met. So when he vanished, I though that was it, but now I have you as a real friend, so neither of us has to be lonely." Asuka said, looking back at Shinji.  
"直到卡西被指派来监视我。他是我见过的最聪明、最善良、最英俊的人。所以当他消失时，我以为就这样了，但现在我有你作为真正的朋友，所以我们俩都不必孤单。" 明日香说着，回头看向真嗣。

"You see Shinji, I know what it feels like for you when you're around your father, even I could tell he acts cold, even for your commander, so I know that you went through a lot of what I went through. and now that Misato is pretty much checked on us it's just the two of us, as far as I am concerned." Asuka says, as she moves her face closer to Shinji's, a lot like the night before. Shinji blushed as he looks into Asuka's glassy eyes, and notices she's blushing to.  
"你看，真嗣，我知道当你在你父亲身边时的感受，即使是我也能看出他对你很冷漠，甚至作为你的指挥官也是如此，所以我知道你经历了很多我经历过的。现在既然美里基本上已经不再管我们，就只剩下我们两个人了，至少我是这么认为的。" 明日香说着，她的脸靠近真嗣的，很像前一晚的样子。真嗣脸红了，他看着明日香那双水汪汪的眼睛，注意到她也在脸红。

"But that's OK, because that's all I want, one other person who understands me, and who I understand, and now I know that Kaji wasn't teasing me when he said we should get together." Asuka says as she kisses Shinji on the lips.  
"但这没关系，因为这就是我想要的，另一个理解我、我也理解的人，现在我知道卡西不是在逗我，他说我们应该在一起。" 明日香说着，吻上了真嗣的唇。

It is a light and easy kiss, but very affectionate all the same.  
这是一个轻柔而简单的吻，却同样充满了深情。

Pulling away Asuka looks into Shinji eyes again. "Because I love you Shinji."  
阿苏卡移开目光，再次凝视着真嗣的眼睛。“因为我爱你，真嗣。”

"A...Asuka." Shinji stammers, but Asuka goes in for another kiss, this time wrapping her arms around his neck, opening her mouth, and pushing her tongue into his mouth.  
“阿...阿苏卡。”真嗣结巴着，但阿苏卡再次吻了上去，这次她双臂环抱住他的脖子，张开嘴，将舌头探入他的口中。

Shinji is surprised by this and ends up falling onto the floor with Asuka still clinging to him.  
真嗣对此感到惊讶，结果和仍然紧抱着他的明日香一起摔倒在地。

She breaks their kiss and stars down at him lovingly, having ended up on top of him.  
她结束了他们的吻，深情地低头看着他，发现自己已经趴在了他身上。

Seeing he was still a little confused, Asuka gets off of him and sits up on her knees on the floor. "Sorry if I surprised you there, I didn't know how to show how I felt any better." Asuka says in a caring voice that she never used on Shinji before.  
看到他还有些困惑，明日香从他身上下来，跪坐在地板上。“如果我吓到你了，对不起，我不知道怎样才能更好地表达我的感受。”明日香用一种从未对真嗣使用过的关切语气说道。

Sitting up himself, Shinji tried to articulate what was going through his mind.  
坐起身来，真嗣试图表达自己内心的想法。

"I didn't know you felt that way about me Asuka." Shinji says while blushing.  
“我不知道你对我有这样的感觉，明日香。”真嗣说着，脸颊泛红。

"You feel the same way about me, don't you Shinji?" Asuka asks, with just a bit of uncertainty.  
“你对我也有同样的感觉，对吧，真嗣？”明日香问道，语气中带着一丝不确定。

Looking at Asuka, Shinji saw she was in a more vulnerable state then he had ever seen her in. She had her insecurities, but now it seemed she was trusting Shinji to see her as her true feeling made her. Seeing this, Shinji felt she should just speak from his own heart.  
看着明日香，真嗣发现她比以往任何时候都更加脆弱。她有自己的不安，但现在她似乎信任真嗣，让他看到她真实的情感。看到这一幕，真嗣觉得他应该直接表达自己的心声。

"I actually do Asuka. I love you to." If felt so natural for Shinji to say those words.  
“我确实是的，明日香。我爱你。”真嗣说出这些话时感觉如此自然。

Over joyed at the returning of her feelings Asuka leaped at him and kissed him again.  
听到自己的感情得到了回应，明日香欣喜若狂地扑向他，再次吻了他。

After these kiss was done she said. "This is great now we'll always have each other, we don't have to let your Dad or Misato dominate our lives any more so long as we have each other." Asuka happily said.  
亲吻结束后，她说道：“这太好了，现在我们永远拥有彼此，我们不必再让你的爸爸或美里主宰我们的生活，只要我们拥有彼此。”明日香开心地说。

"Why are you being so rough on Misato anyway, isn't she just going through the same lose we are?" Shinji asks.  
“你为什么对美里这么苛刻，难道她不是和我们一样在经历失去吗？”真嗣问道。

Asuka leans back on to her kneeling position and and looks at Shinji with a stoic expression. Normally, she would lean into Shinji for going to easy on Misato, but now she knew she had to treat him with more respect. "I'm sorry to tell you this Shinji, but it is not the same. While it is true Misato saw a lot in Kaji, and probably still had feelings for him, that dose not excuse how she has handled this. She is a grown women, with a life and friends beyond Kaji, other people to go to for support, on top of that, she is a officer, and a legal guardian to two young people, it is irresponsible to let even something like this affect her duties as much as she is." Asuka deadpanly says.  
"明日香向后跪坐，面无表情地看着真嗣。通常情况下，她会因为真嗣对美里太过宽容而靠近他，但现在她知道必须更加尊重他。“真嗣，很抱歉告诉你这些，但这并不一样。虽然美里确实在加持身上看到了很多，可能仍然对他有感情，但这并不能成为她处理这件事的方式的借口。她是一个成熟的女人，有着超越加持的生活和朋友，还有其他人可以寻求支持。更重要的是，她是一名军官，是两个年轻人的法定监护人，让这样的事情如此影响她的职责，实在是太不负责任了。”明日香平淡地说。

"But it's not her fault, I should have comforted her like I did for you, I was right there when she got the last call from Kaji." Shinji defensibly says.  
"但这不是她的错，我本应该像安慰你一样安慰她，她接到碇的最后一个电话时我就在旁边。" 真嗣辩解道。

Asuka could see that this was a big strain on Shinji to put the weight of Misato's issues on himself, but now she could appreciate what this said about how much he cared for the people around him, but she still had to set him straight. "No Shinji that fact of the matter is that it was not your place to make her feel better, again she is the adult, even if you did try, she probably would have rejected your attempts, like I almost did."  
明日香可以看出，将美里的问题压在自己身上对真嗣来说压力很大，但现在她能理解这表明他对周围人的关心有多深，但她仍然需要让他明白。"不，真嗣，事实是，你没有责任让她感觉好些，她毕竟是成年人，即使你尝试了，她可能也会拒绝你的好意，就像我差点做的那样。

Shinji couldn't argue with Asuka's points, he knew he couldn't help Misato, no matter how much he wanted to, but trying to shoulder the blame some how seemed right to him, like it really was partly his responsibility. Realizing this, Shinji looked down in shame.  
真嗣无法反驳明日香的观点，他知道自己无法帮助美里，无论他多么想这么做，但试图承担责任对他来说似乎是正确的，好像这真的部分是他的责任。意识到这一点，真嗣羞愧地低下了头。

Then he felt Asuka's hand on his check, and his face was lifted up to look into her again.  
随后，他感觉到明日香的手放在他的脸颊上，他的脸被抬起，再次与她对视。

"It's good, you want to help those around you, but some times you just can't." Asuka lovingly says.  
"你想帮助周围的人，这很好，但有时候你就是做不到。" 明日香充满爱意地说道。

Shinji's eyes overflow with tears as he embraces Asuka and cries on to her shoulder. Now it was time for Asuka to help Shinji though his feelings.  
真嗣的眼中涌出泪水，他紧紧抱住明日香，靠在她的肩上哭泣。现在，轮到明日香帮助真嗣度过他的情感难关了。

They hold each other for some time, until Shinji calms down. They look into each other eyes again, Asuka whips away Shinji tears.  
他们相拥了一会儿，直到真嗣平静下来。他们再次凝视对方的眼睛，明日香拭去了真嗣的泪水。

"What do we do now?" Shinji asks.  
“我们现在该怎么办？”真嗣问道。

Asuka knew what to do for both of them admittedly.  
明日香确实知道他们俩该如何是好。

---

Asuka stands up, and takes Shinji by the hand back to her room.  
明日香站起身，拉着真嗣的手回到自己的房间。

Once there Shinji asks. "Asuka, what are we doing..." Shinji was cut off as Asuka kisses him. This time it was far more passionate, more energy, and heat behind it as Asuka thrusts her tongue into Shinji's mouth and swirls it with his. She grads him by the shoulders to keep him straight as she push her face into his.  
一到房间，真嗣便问道：“明日香，我们这是在做什么……”话未说完，明日香便吻了上去。这次的吻更加热烈，充满了激情与温度，明日香将舌头探入真嗣口中，与他交缠。她抓住他的肩膀，稳住他的身体，将自己的脸紧紧贴向他的。

Asuka breaks the kiss, and string of saliva connects their mouths for a second.  
明日香结束了这个吻，两人的唇间牵出一丝唾液，短暂相连。

Shinji's knees go weak at what Asuka just did to him. It wasn't bad by any sense, but it just caught him off guard.  
真嗣的双膝因明日香刚才的举动而发软。这并非坏事，只是让他措手不及。

Before his head could stopped spinning Shinji notices that Asuka has her hands at the hem of her night shirt. Before he could react, Asuka hand the shirt off and over her head, holding it at her side as she let's Shinji star at her 30C breasts.  
在真嗣的头脑还未停止旋转之前，他注意到明日香正将双手放在睡衣的下摆上。他还来不及反应，明日香已经脱下睡衣，从头上取下，一手拿着，任由真嗣盯着她那 30C 的胸部。

Shinji's face breaks out in a extreme blush as he makes a surprised face and blood drips from his noise.  
真嗣的脸颊因极度羞涩而泛红，他惊讶地张大了嘴巴，鼻血也随之滴落。

Before he can do anything else, Asuka drops her shirt and steps towards Shinji.  
在他能做出其他反应之前，明日香脱下衬衫，向真嗣走去。

Out of nerves alone Shinji let's himself get pushed back up against a wall as Asuka grabs his shoulder and kisses him again. After that Asuka moves her mouth to his ear and whispers. "It's OK, like I said it's just you and me, we already love each other, this is just about showing that."  
"仅仅是出于紧张，真嗣让自己被推到墙边，明日香抓住他的肩膀再次吻了他。之后，明日香将嘴唇移到他的耳边，轻声说道：“没事的，就像我说的，只有你和我，我们早已相爱，这只是表达那份爱。””

Asuka moves her head back to look into Shinji's face again. He seems to have been calmed by her words.  
明日香将头移开，再次凝视真嗣的脸庞。他似乎被她的话安抚了。

"Asuka, are you sure, this seems to being moving pretty fast?" Shinji says.  
"明日香，你确定吗？这进展似乎有点快。" 真嗣说道。

Smiling, Asuka answers back. "We've be through so much together, we've practically gone to hell and back with each other, if you count fighting a monster in a volcano hell, which I do. We love each other, we are attracted to each, we aren't doing anything wrong." Asuka then unbuttons Shinji's night shirt, feeling his toned chest.  
明日香微笑着回应："我们经历了那么多，几乎可以说是共同经历了地狱般的考验，如果你把在火山地狱中与怪兽战斗也算上的话，我确实这么认为。我们相爱，彼此吸引，我们并没有做错什么。" 明日香随后解开了真嗣的睡衣扣子，感受着他结实的胸膛。

At Asuka's touch, Shinji loses what little resistance he had left. He kisses Asuka back, and let's her pull him back towards her bed, where she lies herself down and Shinji joins her. They resume kissing and Shinji holds Asuka's breasts in his hands.  
在明日香的触碰下，真嗣仅存的一点抵抗也消失了。他回吻了明日香，并任由她将自己拉向她的床边，她躺下后，真嗣也跟着躺下。他们继续亲吻，真嗣用手握住了明日香的胸部。

Asuka fully removes Shinji shirt and breaks their kiss to say one more thing. "You know, whenever Kaji would joke about you and Misato hooking up, I always felt just a little bit of jealousy, but now I can know that I've gotten what she can't."  
明日香完全脱掉了真嗣的衬衫，并中断了这个吻，说了一句话：“你知道吗，每当加持先生开玩笑说你和美里会在一起时，我总是感到一丝嫉妒，但现在我知道，我得到了她无法得到的东西。”

Asuka then removes her pajama shorts and panties, making her completely naked, at this Shinji removes his own pants and underwear, becoming just as naked.  
接着，明日香脱掉了她的睡裤和内裤，使自己完全赤裸，这时真嗣也脱掉了自己的裤子和内裤，同样一丝不挂。

Knowing what comes next, Shinji lays on top Asuka body, feeling their naked skin touch.  
知道接下来会发生什么，真嗣躺在了明日香的身上，感受着他们裸露肌肤的接触。

They resume kissing, Shinji starts to line up his erect penis with Asuka's virgin vagina. But before he enters she feels nervous and starts shacking.  
他们继续亲吻，真嗣开始将勃起的阴茎对准明日香的处女阴道。但在进入之前，她感到紧张并开始颤抖。

"What's wrong? Asuka asks.  
“怎么了？”明日香问道。

"It's just I don't want to hurt you, and I don't know much about what I'm doing."  
“只是我不想伤害你，而且我也不太清楚自己在做什么。”

Feeling touched by Shinji's concern, Asuka reassures him. "It's all OK, I know what's coming, but I also know you wouldn't hurt me on propose. Just kiss me while you go in and it with distract us both from our nerves."  
被真嗣的关心所感动，明日香安慰他道：“没事的，我知道接下来会发生什么，但我也知道你绝不会故意伤害我。你进去的时候吻我，这样能让我们俩都从紧张中分心。”

"OK, if your sure." Shinji says as he kisses Asuka, and pushes forward into her wet entrance.  
“好吧，如果你确定的话。”真嗣说着，吻了吻明日香，然后推进她湿润的入口。

As Shinji goes in he is instantly lost in the feeling of Asuka's womanhood. He moves on until he hits her hymen, he is so overcome with new sensations, and knowing that Asuka was already OK with this, Shinji pushes on.  
当真嗣进入时，他立刻沉浸在明日香的女性魅力中。他继续前进，直到触碰到她的处女膜，他被新的感觉所淹没，知道明日香已经对此表示同意，真嗣便继续推进。

At feeling her maidenhood being broken, and Shinji's size, Asuka's face clenches up a bit and a tear drips from her eye, all while she and Shinji are still kissing each other.  
感受到自己的童贞被夺走，以及真嗣的尺寸，明日香的面部微微紧绷，一滴泪水从她的眼角滑落，而她和真嗣仍在彼此亲吻。

Asuka's pussy felt so tight and warm to Shinji, that he kept pushing further in until his and Asuka's hips were pressed against each other and the tip of Shinji's cock was pressing up against Asuka's cervix.  
明日香的私处对真嗣来说既紧致又温暖，他不断深入，直到两人的臀部紧贴，真嗣的阴茎尖端顶在了明日香的宫颈上。

At this point they break their kiss to breath deeply their their bodies sweat from each other's heat.  
此时，他们停止了亲吻，深呼吸以缓解彼此身体因热度而产生的汗水。

As their are catching their breath, Asuka tells Shinji. "S...S...Shinji, you can start moving now, please move, please." Asuka almost begs between breaths.  
当他们喘息未定，明日香对真嗣说：“真...真...真嗣，你现在可以动了，请动一下，求你了。”明日香几乎是在喘息间哀求。

Listening to her, Shinji begins to move his cock out of Asuka, she was so tight, that he had a hard time moving at all that first, but it made Asuka mouth hang open in pure pleasure now that the initial pain from losing her virginity was gone, and Shinji loved how Asuka's womanhood seemed to cling tightly to his manhood.  
听着她的话，真嗣开始将他的阳具从明日香体内抽出，她太紧了，以至于最初他几乎动弹不得，但这让明日香因失去初夜的痛苦消退后，张大了嘴，纯粹的快感涌现，真嗣喜欢明日香的私处紧紧包裹住他的感觉。

Once he was almost all the way out of her, Shinji pushes right back in with a bit more ease this time, bottoming out at Asuka's cervix with more force, causing Asuka to let out a pleasured yelp.  
当他几乎完全抽出后，真嗣这次稍微轻松地再次推入，用力顶到明日香的宫颈，使得明日香发出一声愉悦的尖叫。

They went on like this. Shinji kept pumping into Asuka faster and faster, and she loved it more and more. Wrapping her arms and lags around his body, and Shinji held her tight in his arms, and began to suck at her breast, taking each nipple in turn.  
他们就这样继续着。真嗣不断地加快对明日香的冲击，而她也越来越享受。她用双臂和双腿紧紧缠绕着他的身体，真嗣则紧紧抱着她，开始轮流吮吸她的乳房。

"Oh Shinji...Shinji" Asuka says between moans. "You so big, and so much better then I thought you would be our first time. If I knew you would be like this, I would have jumped on you first chance I got after we first meet!" Asuka joyously calls out.  
“哦，真嗣...真嗣”，明日香在呻吟中断断续续地说道，“你真是又大又棒，比我想象中的第一次要好得多。如果早知道你会是这样，我一见面就会找机会扑倒你！”明日香欣喜地呼喊着。

Shinji continue his rhythm, kissing Asuka again, she is sent into her first orgasm. "AHHHHHHHH" Asuka yells as her squirts on to herself and Shinji where they are joined.  
真嗣继续保持节奏，再次吻上明日香，她迎来了第一次高潮。“啊啊啊啊啊”，明日香尖叫着，她和真嗣结合处喷涌而出。

"Asuka are you OK?" Shinji asks without breaking his movements.  
"Asuka，你还好吗？" 真嗣问道，动作未曾停歇。

"Better then OK, you are the best Shinji!" Asuka says in her post-orgasmic state.  
"何止还好，你是最棒的，真嗣！" Asuka 在高潮后的余韵中说道。

Their love making continued for a while, both their breathing getting deeper and the bodies got sweatier.  
他们的缠绵持续了一段时间，两人的呼吸愈发深沉，身体也越发汗湿。

Before to long Shinji found himself on the brink of his own release while Asuka was fast approaching her second climax.  
不久后，真嗣发现自己即将达到高潮，而明日香也迅速逼近她的第二次巅峰。

As they both reached the point of no return, they both screamed "AHHHHHHHHH" simultaneously as their mutual orgasm tore through their bodies. Thick ribbons of Shinji's white cum gushed into Asuka. Asuka's eyes rolled back a bit at the pleasure.  
当两人都到达无法回头的时刻，他们同时尖叫着“啊啊啊啊啊啊”，彼此的性高潮撕裂着他们的身体。真嗣的白色精液如厚厚的丝带般涌入明日香体内。明日香因快感而眼睛微微翻白。

Shinji rolled off of Asuka as the couple caught their breaths. Shinji and Asuka begin to cuddle in their post coital bliss.  
真嗣从明日香身上滚开，两人开始调整呼吸。真嗣和明日香在性爱后的幸福中开始依偎。

"Shinji." Asuka got Shinji's intention after a moment of quiet. Shinji turns to look into her Asuka's now loving eyes. "Thank you again Shinji, you are everything I needed and more. and now you are mine and mine alone." Asuka says and she kisses Shinji again, and Shinji returns the kiss.  
"真嗣。" 短暂的沉默后，明日香明白了真嗣的心意。真嗣转头望向她，此刻明日香的眼中充满了爱意。"再次感谢你，真嗣，你是我所需要的一切，甚至更多。现在，你只属于我一个人。" 明日香说着，再次吻上了真嗣，而真嗣也回应了她的吻。

After they break their kiss, Asuka asks. "You'll stay with me tonight, right?"  
他们分开双唇后，明日香问道："你今晚留下来陪我，对吧？"

"Of course I will Asuka." Shinji answers.  
"当然会的，明日香。" 真嗣回答道。

They kiss one more time, then they cuddle in each other arms.  
他们再次亲吻，然后依偎在彼此的怀抱中。

Asuka's soft fiery red hair is the last thing Shinji feels on his face before he falls asleep.  
明日香那柔软的火红色头发是真嗣入睡前面颊上感受到的最后一样东西。
