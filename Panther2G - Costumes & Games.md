The Angel War is over and past. Shinji and Asuka survived thanks to each other, and now are enjoying the benefits of saving the world: Getting to live in it. But Asuka has one last deep secret to reveal... one that will bind them together even more.  
服装与游戏 天使战争已成为过去。真嗣和明日香因彼此而幸存，现在正享受着拯救世界的成果：得以在其中生活。但明日香还有一个深藏的秘密要揭露……一个将使他们更加紧密相连的秘密。

---

It had started with little things.  
一切都是从小事开始的。

They enjoyed doing things together, shopping included. Hell, after the desperately lonely childhoods they'd both had, they liked being together full stop. Just being constantly around each other, always knowing that someone who loved them was literally within arm's reach was a source of warmth for both of them.  
他们喜欢一起做事，包括购物。天哪，经历了各自孤独的童年后，他们喜欢待在一起，就这么简单。始终陪伴在彼此身边，时刻知道有一个深爱自己的人就在伸手可及的地方，这对他们俩来说都是一种温暖。

Misato used to gently tease them about it, commenting about 'being joined at the hip in more ways than one', but even she had eventually quieted, ending up slightly envious of how deeply in tune they were, able to have entire conversations without a word.  
美里过去常温柔地取笑他们，说他们'不仅仅是形影不离'，但就连她最终也安静了下来，对他们的默契深感羡慕，他们甚至能在无言中进行完整的对话。

What broke Misato on that front was one occasion where she'd asked them about going out for dinner and a movie as a double pair with her and Kaji. Shinji had turned to Asuka, sitting beside him on the couch. Without a word, only looks, eyebrows, and small nods or shakes of their heads, they'd gone over the idea. Shinji then turned back to Misato, and told her the movie they'd picked out, and the restaurant they wanted to go to.  
让美里在这方面崩溃的是一次她提议和他们一起作为两对情侣出去吃饭看电影。真嗣转向坐在沙发上的明日香。没有言语，仅凭眼神、眉毛以及轻微的点头或摇头，他们就讨论了这个想法。随后，真嗣转回美里，告诉她他们选的电影和他们想去的餐厅。

Misato had just stared back at them for a minute before declaring, "That was some spooky couple's telepathy, kids."  
美里盯着他们看了一会儿，然后宣布：“孩子们，那可是有点吓人的情侣心灵感应啊。”

Shinji had calmly answered, "Alles Teil meines Plans die Welt zu übernehmen und sie meinem Freund vor die Füße zu legen." [All part of my plan to take over the world for Shinji, and lay it at my boyfriend's feet.]  
真嗣平静地回答：“Alles Teil meines Plans die Welt zu übernehmen und sie meinem Freund vor die Füße zu legen.” [一切都是我为真嗣夺取世界，并将其献给我男朋友的计划的一部分。]

In reply to Misato's confused look and raised finger, Asuka had put in "Yes, she meant what she said. Mwhahaha. And I will back up my girlfriend every inch. Who can resist her red hair and blue eyes? And oh! That body!" And grinned.  
面对美里困惑的表情和举起的手指，明日香回应道：“是的，她说的就是那个意思。哈哈哈。我会全力支持我的女朋友。谁能抵挡她的红发和蓝眼睛呢？哦！还有那身材！”她笑着说。

That was the point where Misato surrendered on that front.  
就在那一刻，美里在这一方面投降了。

So they'd go out, shop, just wander... Asuka was more than a bit of a fashion plate, and Shinji never minded getting her things to look good in. She was always more than happy to model them for her. She'd dive into her closet (a secret realm still closed to him, even after 2 years together.) and emerge with dazzling combinations of new tops, old shoes, lacy mysteries to tempt him with later... It was another one of their games.  
于是他们外出，购物，只是闲逛……明日香对时尚颇有品味，而真嗣从不介意为她挑选好看的衣服。她总是很乐意为她试穿。她会钻进她的衣橱（一个对他来说仍神秘封闭的领域，即使两人已经在一起两年了），然后带着令人眼花缭乱的新上衣、旧鞋子、蕾丝神秘物品出现，诱惑他以后再探索……这是他们的另一个游戏。

Games. 游戏。

They were on a random, leisurely walk through the mall passing a game shop when the next step came along. Shinji didn't even realize at that point how big a step it was, but it ended up becoming one of the biggest. They were passing the shop, Asuka ignoring it and Shinji not sparing it much of a glance, when a familiar voice cried out in victory from inside. "Blood runs, anger wakes, death rises, war calls!"  
他们正随意地在商场里闲逛，经过一家游戏店时，下一个重要的时刻悄然来临。真嗣当时并未意识到这一步有多么重大，但它最终成为了其中最关键的一步。他们经过那家店时，明日香对此视而不见，真嗣也只是匆匆一瞥，就在这时，店内传来一个熟悉的声音，充满胜利的喜悦：“血流成河，怒火中烧，死亡崛起，战争召唤！”

Asuka stiffened. Shinji stopped, looking at her curiously. She gave him an apologetic glance, then tugged him along behind her by their joined hands.  
明日香身体一僵。真嗣停下脚步，好奇地看着她。她歉意地看了他一眼，然后拉着他们紧握的手，带着他跟在后面。

She plunged right into the back of the store, past models and game books, to where a large table was set up with small buildings, walls, hills... presided over by a smiling Kensuke Aida.  
她径直冲进店铺深处，穿过模型和游戏书籍，来到一张摆满小建筑、墙壁、山丘的大桌前...这里由微笑着的 Kensuke Aida 主持。

"For Khaine!" the freckled boy cried, and then spent the next 20 minutes finishing wiping out his opponents Ultramarines to the last man. "Take that, filthy Mon-Keighs!" he crowed. He went blank when he looked up and finally noticed his friend and the Red Demon watching from the far side of things, after the defeated boy had collected his blue figures and left in shame. "Oh...hey Shinji. Um... Soryu-san."  
"为了 Khaine！" 这个有雀斑的男孩喊道，接下来的 20 分钟里，他彻底消灭了对手的极限战士，直到最后一人。"接招吧，肮脏的 Mon-Keighs！" 他得意地叫道。当他抬头时，才注意到他的朋友和红恶魔从远处看着这一切，战败的男孩已经收起他的蓝色棋子，羞愧地离开了。"哦...嘿，Shinji。嗯... Soryu 小姐。"

"Hi, Kensuke. Um... nice... game? You won?"  
"嗨，Kensuke。嗯...很棒...的游戏？你赢了？"

"Yeah, my Swooping Hawk Eldar can trounce anyone! Those Mon-Keigh stood no chance!"  
"没错，我的翱翔雄鹰艾达尔能打败任何人！那些人类根本没机会！"

"Mon...what?" Shinji blinked.  
"人类...什么？" 真嗣眨了眨眼。

Beside him, Asuka snorted. "Pff. Like beating some idiot playing Ultrasmurfs is a big deal. The Emperor Protects! I could walk you with 500 points of my Guard Regiment."  
在他旁边，明日香嗤之以鼻。"噗。打败一个玩超巨魔的傻瓜有什么了不起的。帝皇庇佑！我用 500 分的卫兵团就能带你走。"

Silence. Both boys stared at the German girl like she'd suddenly started speaking in tongues and breathing fire. She stared back at them. "What?"  
沉默。两个男孩盯着那个德国女孩，仿佛她突然开始说起了方言并喷出火焰。她也回瞪着他们。“怎么了？”

"AAaaaaa!" Kensuke wailed, and pointed at her in shock.  
“啊啊啊啊！” 健介尖叫着，震惊地指向她。

Asuka slammed a hand over his mouth to stop the shout. "And if you breathe a word of this to anyone, I'll feed you your Exarch figurine, got it? Until you can beat me in a 1500 point match, you heard _nothing_."  
明日香一手捂住他的嘴阻止他大喊。“如果你敢向任何人透露一个字，我就把你那尊大主教模型吃了，明白吗？在你能在 1500 分的比赛中打败我之前，你什么都没听到。”

Asuka whirled and... not fled. No, not fled. The mighty and indomitable Asuka Langley Soryu never fled. So her confused boyfriend merely shared a look with Kensuke, shrugged, and followed her.  
明日香转身，不是逃跑。不，不是逃跑。强大且不屈的惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不逃跑。于是她困惑的男友只是与真希波交换了一个眼神，耸了耸肩，跟上了她。

Once home, Asuka confessed. Slowly, haltingly, she revealed her deep, dark secret to Shinji, a secret so shameful she'd kept it hidden even this long, afraid to reveal that side of herself to anyone in Japan. It was something she'd packed away in her mound of boxes, hidden away. Slowly, she dug them out, opened them up, and showed him what was inside. Showed him what she really was.  
一回到家，明日香坦白了。她缓慢而断断续续地向真嗣透露了她深藏的秘密，一个如此羞耻的秘密，以至于她一直隐藏至今，害怕在日本向任何人展示那一面。这是她藏在那一堆箱子里的东西，被深埋起来。她慢慢地把它们挖出来，打开，向他展示里面是什么。向他展示她真正的样子。

Asuka Langley Soryu was a _massive, titanic_ _nerd_.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷是个超级大宅女。

Warhammer 40K books. Figurines. An entire Imperial Guard Regiment, packed in foam-cushioned boxes. Magazines. Models. Manga. SF books. Shinji had boggled at the sheer number of boxes Asuka had piled in the hall when she moved in, but he'd never expected them to have... this.  
战锤 40K 系列书籍。模型。一整支帝国卫队，装在泡沫垫箱中。杂志。模型。漫画。科幻书籍。真嗣当时看到明日香搬进来时在走廊堆满的箱子数量就已经目瞪口呆了，但他从未料到会有...这些。

And then she opened the next box. Costumes. Lots of costumes.  
然后她打开了下一个箱子。服装。好多服装。

His girlfriend was a cosplayer.  
他的女朋友是个角色扮演者。

Asuka looked at him, blushing in embarrassment. Then Shinji said the words that made her light up like a searchlight.  
明日香看着他，羞涩得脸颊泛红。随后，真嗣说出了那句让她瞬间光彩夺目的话。

"C-can... can I see you in some of them?"  
“我...我能...能看看你穿其中一些的样子吗？”

Her smile burst to life. "Yes! I... go sit out in the living room and wait! I'll be right there!" She shooed him out of their room. Not that she had any objections to him seeing her naked anymore, but 'it would ruin the effect!' if he got to watch her change. So out he went.  
她的笑容顿时绽放开来。“当然可以！我...你先去客厅等着！我马上就来！”她把他赶出了房间。倒不是她介意他看到自己裸体，只是‘那样会破坏效果！’如果他看着她换衣服的话。于是他便出去了。

He sat on the couch, leg bouncing, wondering why she'd felt she had to hide this. Didn't she know by now that there was not even one thing about her he didn't accept, didn't adore? Sure, she kind of still worried a little bit about her status as the 'hottest girl in school', and getting caught out-nerding Kensuke Aida would look funny, but still, she shouldn't have to worrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-  
他坐在沙发上，腿不停地抖动，心里纳闷她为何觉得必须隐瞒这件事。难道她还不明白，关于她的一切，他都全盘接受、无比珍爱吗？确实，她有时还会为“学校最火辣的女孩”这一身份感到些许不安，被发现比真希波·明日香·兰格雷还要书呆子会显得滑稽，但她真的不必如此担忧——

His brain stuck. 他的思绪卡住了。

Sailor Mars stood in the doorway to the hall and struck her iconic pose. "Well?" she asked him. "How do I look?" She swung into a graceful spin on one foot, sending her skirt rippling outward and upward a bit.  
水手火星站在通往走廊的门口，摆出了她标志性的姿势。“怎么样？”她问他，“我看起来如何？”她单脚优雅地旋转，裙摆随之向外向上飘扬。

Legs legs legs legs legs skirt heels heels legs form-fitting oh gods lookit those legs tiny skirt oh shit I forgot to breathe I should think about that later legs all the way up dat ass dat ass _dat ass_  
腿腿腿腿腿裙子高跟鞋高跟鞋腿紧身裤哦天哪看那些腿小裙子哦该死我忘了呼吸这个待会儿再想腿一直延伸到那屁股那屁股那屁股

"Gleeble. Bwaaaaaahhhhh."  
"格利布。布拉阿阿阿阿。"

"...Shinji, you're drooling."  
"...真嗣，你流口水了。"

"Uh huh," he agreed vaguely. Whatever she said, it was good.  
"嗯嗯，" 他含糊地同意道。无论她说什么，都挺好的。

Mars sighed, then grabbed his face, pulling it to hers. One thorough kiss later, she released him gently... then bopped him over the head. "Oi, baka. That means wipe your chin and answer my question."  
玛尔斯叹了口气，然后抓住他的脸，将它拉向自己。一番深吻之后，她温柔地放开了他……然后在他头上轻轻敲了一下。"喂，笨蛋。那意思是擦擦你的下巴，回答我的问题。"

"Buh..." A dim awareness that the legs skirt gorgeous hot perfect woman in front of him might leave the room if he didn't reply pushed its way to the front of Shinji's brain and kicked the motor into gear. "Y-y-you look... so hot... brain... not working..." There, that was a complete sentence, right? He wiped a hand in the general area of his chin.  
"呃……" 一种模糊的意识，意识到眼前这位双腿修长、美丽火辣的完美女人可能会离开房间，如果不回复的话，这种意识推动着真嗣的大脑，启动了思考机制。"你……你看起来……好性感……大脑……不工作了……" 好了，这是一个完整的句子，对吧？他用一只手在下巴附近大致擦了擦。

She actually blushed. "It... it's kind of tight. I was a bit smaller and um... 'smaller' when I bought this." She looked down at her chest, slightly accusingly.  
她居然脸红了。“这……有点紧。我买的时候身材比现在小一些，呃……各方面都小一些。”她低头看向自己的胸部，带着一丝责备的神情。

Shinji's eyes helplessly followed, getting rather lost in watching the smooth white material struggle valiantly to contain his lover's assets, which were a good deal more substantial now than they'd been when they'd first met. "Iz fine..."  
真嗣的目光不由自主地跟随过去，迷失在观察那平滑的白色布料奋力包裹住爱人的丰满身姿中，这些丰满比起他们初次相遇时确实多了不少。“没问题的……”

She snorted. "Well, that answers _that_ question. So... the wig looks alright and everything?"  
她哼了一声。“好吧，这个问题算是解决了。那么……假发看起来还行吧，其他都还好吗？”

"Wig?" he asked blankly. He only just then noticed the long black mane.  
"假发？" 他茫然地问道。直到这时，他才注意到那头长长的黑色鬃毛。

Sailor Mars pulled off her hair and was Asuka again. "Your eyes never got north of my boobs, did they?" she asked acerbically. She then deliberately crossed her arms under her breasts and gave them a pointed lift.  
水手火星摘下假发，又变回了明日香。"你的目光从未越过我的胸部，是吧？" 她尖刻地问道。随后，她故意将双臂交叉在胸前，用力向上托了托。

"S-sorry? Um... and your legs."  
"对-对不起？嗯... 还有你的腿。"

She sat in his lap and raised one leg up high enough that the knee was at face level and her heel well over his head. "_These_ legs?" She ran a hand up one.  
她坐在他的腿上，抬起一条腿，膝盖高到脸的高度，脚后跟则远远超过他的头顶。“这些腿？”她用手顺着一条腿向上抚摸。

"Guh." “呃。”

She lowered her leg. "Hm... hard to sit in your lap right now. Funny, that. Oh well!" She wiggled just a bit on top of the hardest spot. Shinji whimpered at the heat he could feel through two layers of clothing.  
她放下腿。“嗯……现在坐在你腿上有点困难。真有趣，不是吗？哦，算了！”她在最坚硬的地方轻轻扭动了一下。真嗣因隔着两层衣物感受到的热度而发出呜咽声。

She hopped up out of his lap and walked back towards their room. "Wait right here. I've got more where that came from!" She headed off, perfect model heel-toe-heel-toe walk making her hips move in just that way...  
她从他的腿上跳下来，走回他们的房间。“就在这儿等着。我还有更多好东西呢！”她走开了，完美的模特步——脚跟-脚尖-脚跟-脚尖，让她的臀部以那种诱人的方式摆动...

Skirt skirt skirt legs dat ass...  
裙子裙子裙子，那双腿，那翘臀...

A few minutes later, Lum emerged. Then Noriko Takaya. Then Rias Gremory. Her Lina Inverse was... even better than canon. Certainly 'bigger'. Then came Yoko Littner. At which point Shinj's willpower gave up, handed the wheel to his lizard brain, and signed out for the night. Asuka squealed in amusement and anticipation as Shinji picked her up, tossed her onto his shoulder, and carried her into their room. Loud, repeated combinations of "GOTT!" "JA!" and "SHINJI!" began to emerge shortly, and went on for a while.  
几分钟后，Lum 出现了。接着是 Noriko Takaya。然后是 Rias Gremory。她的 Lina Inverse...甚至比原作还要出色。确实‘更大’。接着是 Yoko Littner。这时，Shinj 的意志力放弃了，把控制权交给了他的爬行动物脑，然后就下线了。Asuka 兴奋地尖叫着，期待着，Shinji 把她抱起来，扔到肩上，扛进了他们的房间。很快，“GOTT！”“JA！”和“SHINJI！”的组合声开始响起，持续了一段时间。

Dinner was late that night. Good thing Misato was late coming home too.  
那晚晚餐晚了些。好在美里回家也迟。

And the games began. 游戏开始了。

Asuka's cosplay stayed a hidden treasure for them alone, but she began wearing even more daring outfits in public. The shortest skirts. The tightest tops. She seemed to revel in her power over his reactions, which he happily and freely gave. She smiled even more now.  
明日香的 cosplay 成了他们独享的秘密宝藏，但她开始在公共场合穿着更加大胆的服装。最短的裙子。最紧的上衣。她似乎陶醉于自己对他反应的掌控力，而他则乐意且自由地给予回应。她现在笑得更灿烂了。

Escalation ensued. Finding out-of-the-way corners to exploit for urgent privacy became a sport of its own. They _both_ developed a bit of a taste for sneaking sex when out on the town, whenever Asuka managed to drive him to his limit with teasing glimpses of her body. She took to wearing underwear only as a way to drive him even higher with lust, when she bothered to wear some at all. Guessing that one was a game too.  
事态逐渐升级。寻找偏僻角落以获取急需的隐私成了一种独特的运动。两人都培养出一种在城里偷情的嗜好，每当明日香用挑逗的眼神展示她的身体，逼得他达到极限时。她开始只穿内衣，作为一种更进一步激发他欲望的手段，如果她愿意穿的话。猜测她的心思也是一种游戏。

And at home, she showed him just how many costumes she had, and how good she looked in them. She'd always been happy about the fact that he really looked at her, but now she was almost hypnotic to him, and he made sure she knew it. More than one morning saw Misato giving them mildly dark looks, especially if Kaji was kept out on trips by his work. The end of the Angel War hadn't meant an end to the need for UN Inspectors, after all.  
而在家里，她向他展示了她有多少套服装，以及她穿上它们有多迷人。她一直很高兴他真的在关注她，但现在她对他来说几乎具有催眠效果，他确保她知道这一点。不止一次，Misato 早上给他们投来略带阴沉的目光，尤其是当 Kaji 因工作出差时。毕竟，天使战争的结束并不意味着联合国监察员的需求也随之结束。

And even if Asuka did grin smugly at Misato, she never got obnoxious about it. Misato couldn't really complain. She made up for it when Kaji came home, and Shinji and Asuka had already long since demonstrated that their relationship was based on far more than just playing 'Who Gets Tired First?'.  
即使明日香得意地对 Misato 咧嘴笑，她也从未变得过分。Misato 无法真正抱怨。当 Kaji 回家时，她会弥补这一点，而 Shinji 和明日香早已证明他们的关系远不止于玩'谁先累倒'的游戏。

Other games went on too. The morning after that first incident in the games shop, a letter was slipped into their mailbox. Addressed to 'The Red Demon', it was a handwritten challenge to battle... written in Eldar. Asuka had merely glanced at it for a minute, before writing a reply, accepting the Eldar Exarch's terms.  
其他游戏也在继续。在游戏店发生第一次事件后的早晨，一封信被塞进了他们的邮箱。信封上写着‘红魔’，是一封用艾达语手写的挑战书。明日香只是瞥了一眼，便写了一封回信，接受了艾达族长老的条件。

And two days later, Kensuke Aida was forced to watch in disbelief as Imperial Guard panzers crushed his Swooping Hawks almost easily. That Asuka had come to the match in a Commissar's uniform, complete with Bolt Pistol and sword, only made it worse. He looked close to tears when she made him call her 'Creed's daughter'. Shinji still had barely any idea what was going on. He had no complaints when after the match, flush with victory, Asuka had gotten them home in record time, gotten them into bed, and then proceeded to show him just how much energy a crushing victory like that gave her. Several times.  
两天后，相田健介难以置信地看着帝国卫队的坦克几乎轻松地碾压了他的飞鹰战队。明日香穿着政委的制服，配以爆弹手枪和军刀，这让他更加难受。当她让他称呼她为‘克里德的女儿’时，他看起来几乎要哭了。真嗣仍然几乎不知道发生了什么。比赛结束后，明日香带着胜利的喜悦，以创纪录的速度带他们回家，让他们上床睡觉，然后向他展示了像这样压倒性的胜利能给她带来多少能量。好几次。

Escalation continued. It was not long before Asuka got some more costumes. For him.  
升级继续进行。不久之后，明日香又为他准备了一些服装。

"But Asuka, _Sword Art Online_ had terrible writing and a ridiculous plot. You even said so when we watched it."  
“但明日香，《刀剑神域》的剧情写得很糟糕，情节也荒唐。我们看的时候你不是也这么说的吗？”

She shrugged. "Yeah, but the music was great, and the art was pretty. Not every show is going to be as wild and awesome as _Children's Crusade_ was. And don't you want to see _me_ in Asuna's outfit, hmm?"  
她耸了耸肩。“是啊，但音乐很棒，画面也很美。不是每个节目都能像《儿童十字军》那样狂野又精彩。而且，你不想看看我穿亚丝娜的服装吗，嗯？”

He opened his mouth, but before willpower could complain about Kirito being an edgelord idiot, lizard brain seized the wheel and said "Yes! I'll wear the black outfit for that! Worth it!"  
他张开嘴，但还没等意志力抱怨桐人是个装酷的傻瓜，原始本能就抢过了方向盘，说：“好！我会穿那套黑色服装的！值得！”

"Good boy." The smile that ruled his heart.  
“好孩子。”那笑容主宰了他的心。

After a few months, Shinji was amazed by several things: That they'd still never been caught in public 'running Entry Plug simulations', that Asuka kept coming up with new costumes, and that Kensuke Aida, military nerd extraordinaire, _still_ could not beat Asuka in Warhammer 40K.  
几个月后，真嗣对几件事感到惊讶：他们从未在公共场合被抓到“运行插入栓模拟”，明日香总能想出新的服装，而军事迷中的佼佼者相田剑介，依然无法在战锤 40K 中击败明日香。

She'd admit, privately to him only, that she'd been saved at least twice by bullshit luck with the rolls at a point where things could have gone bad, but both times she'd managed to play it off like she'd planned it all along. There was no irony left in Kensuke's voice now when he called her 'Creed's daughter'. Nor was there much spare sweat left in either of them in the now frequent post-battle romps at home. Shinji merely responded by ordering oysters occasionally.  
她私下里只对他承认，她至少有两次是被骰运的狗屎运救了，在那关键时刻事情本可能变糟，但她两次都设法表现得像是早有预谋。现在，当相田剑介称她为‘克里德的女儿’时，他的声音里已经没有讽刺的余地了。他们俩在如今频繁的战后家中嬉戏时，也没有多少剩余的汗水了。真嗣只是偶尔回应，点些牡蛎。

Rangiku Matsumoto was a memorable one. So was Holo the Wise Wolf. And Seras Victoria (she left fang marks on his neck that Misato noticed the next morning). She was Nami at the beach one weekend. Asuna Kagurazaka she did with her own hair. He admitted he wished their regular uniforms looked like that.  
松本乱菊是个难忘的回忆。还有智慧之狼赫萝。以及塞拉斯·维多利亚（她在他的脖子上留下了牙印，第二天早上被美里注意到了）。她在某个周末的海滩上是娜美。她用自己的头发扮演了神裂火织。他承认他希望他们的常规制服看起来像那样。

Their birthdays were _fun_. Sometimes Rei would come 'help'. And stay for a few nights.  
他们的生日很有趣。有时零会来‘帮忙’。然后留宿几晚。

Time went by. He learned things. He had an entire part of his personal cookbook tabbed in red. Misato noticed it at one point.  
时间流逝。他学到了很多。他的个人食谱书中有一整部分用红色标签标记。美里在某一刻注意到了这一点。

"Shin-chan?" "新之助？"

"Mmm?" he said absently, stirring the pot of spiced stew.  
"嗯？" 他心不在焉地回答，搅拌着那锅香料炖菜。

"Why are these pages tabbed red?"  
"为什么这些页面被标记为红色？"

He looked over at the page she'd tapped and smiled. "Oh, those are my 'romance' recipes."  
他瞥了一眼她轻敲的那页，微笑道：“哦，这些是我的‘浪漫’食谱。”

Misato smiled back at him. They were such a cute pair. "Aww, you mean Asuka's favorites?"  
美里笑着回应他。他们真是一对可爱的组合。“哎呀，你是说明日香最喜欢的那些吗？”

"Kind of. More like I get so into making them that she jumps me halfway through. I had to make some tough choices; slow cooking meals work best, nothing I have to keep an eye on. Sous-vide has saved so many dinners."  
“算是吧。更像是我在做这些菜时太投入，她中途就会扑过来。我不得不做出一些艰难的选择；慢炖的菜肴效果最好，不需要我时刻盯着。真空低温烹饪法拯救了无数顿晚餐。”

Misato looked thoughtful...and asked to copy a few recipes.  
美里看起来若有所思...并请求复印几份食谱。

Asuka got clever about ways to get him into couple's outfits. On at least one occasion:  
明日香想出了各种办法让他穿上情侣装。至少有一次：

Shinji didn't want to go out. He hated parties. Always too loud, too many people, too close... And a costume party? Meh. He'd rather just-  
真嗣不想出去。他讨厌派对。总是太吵，人太多，距离太近...还有化装派对？算了。他宁愿只是——

"Ohhh, Shinji~" “哦，真嗣~”

[ arsadeptus / / cpCorsetAsukaFinal. p n g]

He looked up. Asuka was already in her costume. And part way _out_ of her costume. Wow. Um... what had he been doing?  
他抬起头。明日香已经穿上了她的服装。并且部分脱下了她的服装。哇。嗯...他刚才在做什么？

His girlfriend crooked a finger, beckoning. She snapped her hips to the side and struck a pose. "Are you _still_ willing to say you don't want to go to this party?" she said, sultrily.  
他的女朋友勾了勾手指，示意他过去。她扭动着臀部，摆出一个姿势。“你还是不愿意去参加这个派对吗？”她娇媚地说道。

"Suddenly, I'm very interested. Let me go see what black clothes I've got in my closet _right now._"  
“突然间，我非常感兴趣。让我去看看衣柜里现在有什么黑色的衣服。”

"Good boy," she grinned. "Are you developing a 'cosplay thing', yet?"  
“好孩子，”她咧嘴一笑。“你是不是也开始对‘角色扮演’感兴趣了？”

He pulled her into his lap and ran his hand up along her hose and under her skirt. "I have an 'Asuka' thing, I think." His hands and face froze when his fingertips found no silk or satin, only heat and growing dampness. "Oh my... are you..."  
他将她拉入怀中，手掌顺着她的连裤袜向上滑入裙下。“我想，我有点‘明日香’情结。”当他的指尖没有触到丝绸或缎面，只有温热和逐渐的湿润时，他的手和脸都僵住了。“哦，我的... 你...”

Asuka grinned like a wolf and leaned into his chest, thrusting her own out at the same time. "Hey, we put a lot of work into all that commando training at NERV. Good to get some use of it, ja?"  
明日香咧嘴一笑，像狼一样，同时靠向他的胸膛，挺起自己的胸脯。“嘿，我们在 NERV 进行了大量的突击训练。能派上用场真好，对吧？”

"Commando... _training_?" “突击...训练？”

They didn't leave that party early. They just snuck off in the middle of it and Asuka showed off more of her commando training. To be fair, they did stealthily manage to avoid the 'guards', even _in media res_.  
他们并没有提前离开那场派对。只是中途悄悄溜走，而明日香展示了更多她的突击队员训练。公平地说，他们确实巧妙地避开了那些“守卫”，即便是在事情正酣之时。

More escalation. Asuka began making her own, even more elaborate and custom tailored costumes. A seamstress's dummy appeared in one room of the apartment they moved into together, a few doors down from Misato's. (Misato had needed the extra room once she got Kaji to stand still long enough to start some kids. Asuka was 18 by then, so it wasn't too much trouble to get their own place, especially when NERV still owned the building.)  
进一步升级。明日香开始制作更加复杂且量身定制的服装。他们一起搬进的新公寓其中一个房间里出现了一个裁缝假人，离美里家只隔了几扇门。（美里自从和加持安定下来并开始养育孩子后，就需要更多的空间。那时明日香已经 18 岁，所以他们自己找个地方住并不太麻烦，尤其是 NERV 还拥有这栋楼。）

Asuka's talent with a needle and design was as sharp as her other skills. Shinji was often at a loss from her more daring ones. And Asuka _loved_ watching him react to them.  
明日香在针线和设计方面的天赋与她的其他技能一样锐利。真嗣常常对她更大胆的创意感到不知所措。而明日香则喜欢看他对此的反应。

One day Asuka left her laptop open to the design program, and a curious Shinji had taken a look at the latest one. It took _full_ advantage of the effects of a tight corset on Asuka's still burgeoning figure. Shinji stared at it, frozen. "Wow..."  
一天，明日香忘记关闭她的笔记本电脑上的设计程序，好奇的 Shinji 便瞥了一眼最新的设计。这件设计充分利用了紧身胸衣对明日香尚未完全发育的身材的效果。Shinji 盯着它，愣住了。“哇...”

Asuka looked over his shoulder. "Oh yeah that one's not ready ye-"  
明日香从他肩头望过去。“哦，那个还没准备好——”

"Don't care get dressed now," he said, voice tight and urgent.  
“别管了，现在就穿好衣服，”他语气紧张而急迫地说。

"A-and what's gonna happen when I do?"  
“那我穿好后会发生什么？”

"I am going to bend you over your desk and give you my full, honest, and exhaustive opinion on it," he growled, deep and low, that tone that never failed to get her nipples hard.  
"我要把你按在桌子上，给你我全面、诚实、详尽的意见，"他低沉地咆哮着，那种语气总能让她乳头硬起来。

Asuka swallowed heavily, her pulse visibly beginning to speed up . "W-with follow up review periods?" She rubbed her thighs together, feeling heat starting to build already.  
明日香重重地咽了口唾沫，她的脉搏明显开始加速。"后续还有审查期吗？"她摩擦着大腿，感觉到热度已经开始积聚。

"_Yes_." "是的。"

"I like this plan." She began unbuttoning her shirt. It was originally his anyway.  
"我喜欢这个计划。"她开始解开衬衫的扣子。这原本就是他的。

Lunch was _very_ late that day.  
那天午餐吃得很晚。

Years of this. Well, a couple, at least. Kensuke eventually managed to squeak a victory over Asuka. By that point she no longer minded being 'outed' as a nerd. They were having too much fun to slow down. Both of them were waiting for that one day, anyhow.  
多年如此。至少有几年了。最终，健介勉强赢了明日香一回。到那时，她已经不在乎被揭穿是个书呆子了。他们玩得太开心，根本停不下来。反正他们都在等待那一天的到来。

That one day. 那一天。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Mmm?" He didn't look up from his reading. He didn't have to. She was laying on top of him, her own tablet reader on his chest.  
"嗯？" 他没从阅读中抬头。他不必抬头。她正躺在他身上，自己的平板阅读器放在他胸口。

"You know what tomorrow is, right?"  
"你知道明天是什么日子，对吧？"

He swallowed. "...yes. Tomorrow is December 4th, 2021." He failed to keep the quaver out of his voice.  
他咽了咽口水。"...是的。明天是 2021 年 12 月 4 日。" 他没能掩饰住声音中的颤抖。

She nodded, eyes locked on his. "I turn 20."  
她点头，目光紧锁他的。"我满 20 岁了。"

Gulp. "Y-yes." 咽了口口水。"是-是的。"

"Which means we're both adults under Japanese law."  
这意味着根据日本法律，我们都是成年人了。

Another gulp. "Yes." 又是一口。“是的。”

"We can... get..." “我们可以……拿到……”

He turned his tablet around to face her, showing the forms already filled out and ready to be filed. "The city office opens at 0800."  
他将自己的平板电脑转向她，展示出已经填写好、随时可以提交的表格。“市政办公室八点开门。”

Asuka stared at the small pad. "...you sure about-"  
明日香盯着那张小纸片。"...你确定-"

"Yes. I want no part of them."  
"是的。我不想和他们有任何瓜葛。"

She looked at him. His eyes were perfectly calm, cool, and steady. He was sure. "Then... I've got one more costume to bring out that you haven't seen yet." Laying on top of him, she could easily feel his heart start to race.  
她看着他。他的眼神平静、冷静且坚定。他很确定。 "那么...我还有一件你没见过的服装要拿出来。" 她趴在他身上，能轻易感受到他的心跳开始加速。

"The white one?" he asked quietly.  
"白色的那只？" 他轻声问道。

She nodded. "And you've got one more question to ask me."  
她点点头。"你还有最后一个问题要问我。"

"Didn't I ask you that one already, five years ago?" he said softly. He took her left hand in his, raising it so it was in between their faces. Gold and diamond sparkled on her ring finger.  
"五年前我不是已经问过你这个问题了吗？" 他温柔地说。他握住她的左手，举起，让两人的脸之间呈现出她无名指上的金钻戒指闪烁的光芒。

"Yes," she said, even softer. "But I like hearing you say it."  
"是的，" 她轻声说，"但我喜欢听你说。"

He kissed her, smiling. "Should I get in the traditional position?" he asked, his throat tight.  
他吻了她，微笑着。"我应该采取传统姿势吗？" 他问，喉咙发紧。

"I don't feel like moving. Do it right here, like this."  
"我不想动。就在这儿，像这样。"

"Asuka... I want to stay with you always, and be your husband. Will you marry me and let me be yours?"  
“明日香...我想永远和你在一起，成为你的丈夫。你愿意嫁给我，让我成为你的吗？”

She closed her eyes, but damning the tears was futile. "You baka... you always make me cry. Never stop. Yes. Forever yes." She pressed her lips to his.  
她闭上眼睛，但抑制泪水是徒劳的。“你这个笨蛋...你总是让我哭。永远不要停。是的。永远都是。”她将嘴唇贴上他的。

A good while later, they broke. "Then... I can wait to see that costume," he said gently.  
过了一会儿，他们分开。“那么...我可以等着看那套服装，”他温柔地说。

"And I can't wait to kiss my husband... Shinji Soryu."  
"我迫不及待想亲吻我的丈夫... 真嗣·创龙。"

One last costume... the white one. With just a little blue, a gift from a close friend to both of them.  
最后一套服装... 那件白色的。只带一点蓝色，是两位密友送给他们的礼物。

Lace on the trim, a gossamer-sheer veil, and a rippling silk train that trailed behind her like a banner...  
蕾丝镶边，薄如蝉翼的面纱，以及拖曳在她身后如旗帜般飘动的丝绸裙摆...

.

Shinji was very sure it was his favorite she'd ever worn.  
真嗣非常确定这是她穿过的最喜欢的衣服。

It started with little things. It ended with the bigger ones.  
一切始于微不足道的小事，最终却演变成了重大的事件。

And the games had hardly begun.  
而游戏才刚刚开始。
