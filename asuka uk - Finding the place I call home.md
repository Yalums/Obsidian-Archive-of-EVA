Finding the place where I belong. (Home)  
  
She at quietly reading the letter that had arrived in the days post.  
她静静地读着几天前邮寄来的信件。  
  
Dear Fellow Student, 亲爱的同学，  
It has been four years since you left Jr High, You have been invited to a reunion, celebrating the years you spent with us, on Saturday 24th July 2019.  
自你离开初中已过去四年，你受邀参加一个重聚活动，庆祝我们共同度过的岁月，时间是 2019 年 7 月 24 日星期六。  
Hope to see you there.  
期待在那里见到你。  
  
She sat wondering whether she should go back to Japan. It would be nice to see Hikari again to catch up. Letters are okay, but to really talk to her. That would really be a treat.  
她坐着思考是否应该回日本。再次见到光并叙叙旧会很美好。信件交流尚可，但真正与她交谈，那将是一种特别的享受。  
  
'I don't know if he'll be there.' Knowing that she'd probably did not leave in the best of circumstances. The fact that it was just after the third impact, and that the young man which she knew was in deep depression. He had such sadness in his heart. She was trying her best to help him, but she just could not get through.  
“我不知道他是否会在那里。”她知道，自己离开时的情形可能并不理想。那时正值第三次冲击刚过，她所认识的那个年轻人深陷抑郁之中。他的心中充满了悲伤。她竭尽全力想帮助他，却始终无法走进他的内心。  
  
Then NERV made her go back to Germany with unit 02 to protect the second branch as it was being rebuilt. She tried as she stood there at the departure lounge to say 'goodbye' and that 'she'll miss him'. His eyes just seemed, distant and cold. As though whatever he saw during the third impact was not destined for human hearts or minds.  
随后，NERV 让她与 02 号机一同返回德国，保护正在重建的第二支部。她在登机口试图说出“再见”和“我会想你”，但他的眼神却显得遥远而冷漠。仿佛他在第三次冲击中所见的一切，本不该为人心所承受。  
  
At least Misato gave her the attention she wanted from him. With tears rolling down her cheeks, Misato gave her the biggest bear hug she could give, and told her to stay in touch and that she would always have a home with her, she remembered as she wipes away a tear. Waving before she boarded the plane, hoping that he would smile and wave in return.  
至少美里给了她所渴望的关注。泪水滑过脸颊，美里给了她最温暖的拥抱，并告诉她要保持联系，无论何时她都有家可归，她一边擦去泪水一边回忆着。登机前挥手告别，希望他能回以微笑和挥手。  
  
He didn't, he just stood there staring into oblivion. As Misato jumped up and down by his side waving and crying uncontrollably. She turned and boarded the plane destined for her homeland, though she have to admit it no longer felt like home.  
他没有，只是站在那里凝视着虚无。Misato 在他身旁跳上跳下，挥手并无法控制地哭泣。她转身登上了飞往她祖国的飞机，尽管她不得不承认那里已不再有家的感觉。  
  
**************************************************************************************  
  
As she stepped off the plane after her fourteen hour flight she felt tired even though the day was fresh and new. Walking out of Tokyo-3 international airport, she took in the city. She saw that it had been rebuilt, and looked not much different from before the Angels came and destroyed it.  
经过十四小时的飞行后走下飞机，她感到疲惫，尽管这一天是崭新而清新的。走出东京-3 国际机场，她环视这座城市。她看到它已被重建，与天使降临并摧毁之前相比，并没有太大不同。  
  
The Angels. How she once liked to go out and defeat them. The matter of her pride depended on it. But she has changed since then, she knew it deep down in her heart. She wondered if he had changed, as she got into her taxi that was going to take her to the hotel.  
那些天使。她曾经多么喜欢出去击败它们。她的骄傲取决于此。但自那以后她已经改变了，她内心深处明白这一点。她想知道他是否也变了，当她坐上前往酒店的出租车时。  
  
From what she could remember he was a brave young man, even though he didn't believe in his own abilities. She was beginning to wish that she had been more positive towards him, instead of just insulting him all the time. The taxi pulled up outside the hotel.  
从她的记忆中，他是个勇敢的年轻人，尽管他不相信自己的能力。她开始希望自己能对他更积极一些，而不是总是侮辱他。出租车停在了酒店外。  
  
She collected her key and headed to her room. 'He always apologies for things that really weren't his fault.' She even found that annoying at times. 'Perhaps,' she thought, 'if I actually admitted when it was my fault, maybe that could have made a small difference.'  
她拿了钥匙，朝自己的房间走去。'他总是为那些并非他错的事情道歉。'她甚至有时觉得这很烦人。'也许，'她想，'如果我确实承认自己的错误，或许那能带来一点小小的改变。'  
  
Opening the door to her room, to her surprise she found a bunch of flowers laying on the bed. 'Are these from him.' she picked up the flowers and read the card that was attached.  
打开房门，令她惊讶的是，床上放着一束花。'这些是他送的吗？'她拿起花，读了附带的卡片。  
  
You've been away to long,  
你离开太久了，  
Please come home.  请回家吧。  
Misato  美里  
  
A smile found it's way onto her face, followed by a short giggle. Good old Misato, still remembered her. She decided that she would visit Misato, after the reunion, and if all went well, then perhaps she would talk to her about getting transferred back to Japan. She closed her eyes and smelt the flowers.  
一丝微笑悄然爬上她的脸庞，紧接着是一阵短暂的咯咯笑声。老好人美里，依然记得她。她决定在重逢之后去拜访美里，如果一切顺利，或许她会和美里谈谈调回日本的事。她闭上眼睛，嗅着花香。  
  
'I'm almost home,' she thought.  
“我快到家了，”她心想。  
**************************************************************************************  
  
She looked into the mirror, 'Well this is it.' In a few hours she was going to see him again. Looking at her reflection, she saw a young woman who had been through alot, but yet some how manage to keep her beauty.  
她望向镜子，‘好吧，就是这样。’几个小时后她就要再次见到他了。看着镜中的自己，她看到了一个经历颇多却依然保持美丽的年轻女子。  
  
*?*?*?  
  
She took a deep breath, then got into the taxi.  
她深吸了一口气，然后上了出租车。  
  
Oh so familiar, memories. Remembering the many times she and him were running down the street because they were going to be late for school. Or the time she dragged him to the mall, just so she could have a new outfit for the sleep over at Hikari's. She felt mixed emoutions. Some of joy and happyness, others disgust and shame. The taxi pulled up outside the old school. The noise of the playground filled her mind. Even though no children were in sight. Heading inside, a woman sat at a table by the entrance.  
哦，如此熟悉，回忆。记得她和他在街上奔跑的许多次，因为他们上学要迟到了。或者是她拉他去商场，只是为了在光家过夜派对时能有一套新衣服。她感到复杂的情绪。有些是喜悦和幸福，其他的则是厌恶和羞愧。出租车在学校旧址外停下。操场的喧闹声充斥着她的脑海，尽管看不见一个孩子。走进去，一位女士坐在入口处的桌子旁。  
  
"Name please" said the woman.  
“请告诉我您的名字。”女士说道。  
  
"Oh, Asuka Soryu" Sshe replied. The woman handed her the badge with her name on it. Then pointed in the direction she needed to head in. She thanked the woman. And while pinning the badge to her scarlet blouse, she headed in the direction in which the woman showed her.  
“哦，我是惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”她回答道。女士递给她一个写有她名字的徽章，并指向她需要前往的方向。她向女士道谢，然后将徽章别在她鲜红的衬衫上，朝着女士指示的方向走去。  
  
Wondering what was in store.  
心中好奇接下来会发生什么。  
  
Looking through the glass pane, the room was half full of people. She took another deep breath and entered the room. For a few painfull seconds she felt like she was in a room full of total strangers. However relief was at hand.  
透过玻璃窗望去，房间里已经坐了一半的人。她又深吸了一口气，走进了房间。有那么几秒钟，她感觉自己仿佛置身于一群完全陌生的人中间。不过，安慰即将到来。  
  
"Asuka, you never told me you were comming back. It's great to see you!" Hikari came over and gave her a well welcomed hug, behind her stood two more familiar faces.  
“Asuka，你从没告诉我你要回来。见到你真是太好了！”Hikari 走过来给了她一个热情的拥抱，身后还站着两张熟悉的面孔。  
  
"Hikari, it's been too long. It's also good to see you two stooges."  
“Hikari，好久不见。见到你们两个傻瓜也真好。”  
  
"Is this the red haired devil that stands before me?" Toji, still the same, not changed much. 'But I can see why Hikari has fallen in love with him.' She was not wrong in her discription in her letters she sent. 'She discribes him to a tee,' she thought.  
"“这就是站在我面前的红发恶魔吗？” 冬二还是老样子，没怎么变。“但我能理解为什么光会爱上他。” 她在信中对他的描述一点都没错。“她把他描绘得恰到好处，”她心想。  
  
"Nice to see you Toji. I hope you've been taking real good care of Hikari for me," something in her mind told her that Toji's eyes were telling the truth. "Kensuke still gun mad as ever are we?"  
"“很高兴见到你，冬二。希望你一直好好照顾光，” 她心里有个声音告诉她，冬二的眼睛说的是真话。“健介还是一如既往地痴迷枪械，对吧？”  
  
"Asuka, I will never give up my guns, though my main objective is to work for NERV, like you. More in the technological department though." She smiled. Same old Kensuke.  
"“明日香，我永远不会放弃我的枪，尽管我的主要目标是像你一样为 NERV 工作。不过更多是在技术部门。” 她笑了。还是老样子的健介。  
  
"Isn't there a member of us missing?" she had to ask the question. Something in her heart told her to ask. She just needed to know.  
"我们是不是少了一个成员？" 她不得不问这个问题。内心某种感觉告诉她要问。她只是需要知道。  
  
"Shinji? He should be along soon. I'm sure he wouldn't want to miss this for the world." She felt more at ease since she heard those words come from Toji.  
"真嗣？他应该很快就到了。我敢肯定他绝不想错过这个。" 听到这话从东治口中说出来，她感到安心了许多。  
  
"Shinji, glad you could make it," Kensuke called out. Feeling her cheeks go red, she turned. To see him arrive, Shinji Ikari, the boy she lived with, her fellow pilot. And now the man , that she realised she loves, was walking towards her. A man he had now become. Looking smart in his shirt and trousers. She smiled, hoping for the smile she never recieved at the airport when she left.  
"真嗣，很高兴你能来，" 健介喊道。她感到脸颊发烫，转过身去。看到他走来，碇真嗣，与她同住的男孩，她的战友。而现在，她意识到自己爱上的那个男人，正向她走来。他已经成长为一个男子汉，穿着衬衫和长裤，显得精神抖擞。她微笑着，期待着那个在机场离开时未曾得到的微笑。  
  
"Hikari, Toji, and Kensuke how have you been?" he greeted his other friends. Perhaps he has forgotten me she thought.  
"光、冬二和健介，你们最近怎么样？" 他向其他朋友打招呼。也许他已经忘记我了，她心想。  
  
"Asuka ... It's been along while," with that he gave her a hug. She sank into his arms. This was more than she wished for.  
"明日香……好久不见了，" 说着，他给了她一个拥抱。她沉入他的怀抱。这比她所希望的还要多。  
  
"It's been too long Shinji. I've missed you," she spoke the words she wanted him to hear.  
"真的太久了，真嗣。我想你了，" 她说了她想让他听到的话。  
  
"I missed you too Asuka"  
"我也想你了，明日香"

### Chapter 2 Two Hearts Reunited
At hearing his words she felt more alive than she has been in the past four years.  
听到他的话，她感到比过去四年中的任何时候都要充满生机。  
  
"We have a lot to catch up on," Shinji claimed.  
“我们有很多要聊的，”真嗣说道。  
  
"Yeah four years worth. I tell you what, are you still living with Misato?" she wondered if he ever gut and actually moved  
“四年份的。我跟你说，你还在和美里住一起吗？”她好奇他是否曾搬出去过。  
out. 出去。  
  
"Afraid so, it's not that bad, but it hasn't been the same since you left." 'Great,' she thought, 'he's saying all the  
“恐怕是的，也没那么糟，但自从你离开后就不一样了。”‘天哪，’她心想，‘他说的都是些……  
right things.' 正确的事情。  
  
"I'm visiting tomorrow I guess we can really catch up then. As I'm sure you'll agree that fitting a four year story into  
“我明天会来拜访，我想我们到时候可以真正好好聊聊。正如我确信你会同意的，把四年的故事压缩在一个晚上并不理想。”他点头回应。  
one night isn't ideal." He nodded in reply.  
他点头回应。  
  
"Lets do that then, and tonight lets be friends out to have a good time." She could do nothing but find herself agreeing  
“那就这么定了，今晚我们就像朋友一样出去好好玩一场。”她发现自己除了同意别无选择。  
with him. The night for her passed away so easily. She realized that this was home being with them laughing and going over  
和他在一起。这个夜晚对她来说过得如此轻松。她意识到，和他们在一起欢笑、回忆往事，这就是家的感觉。  
old times. All that would make the picture complete was to explain that one thing to him, but that can wait until tomorrow.  
唯一能让这一切更完美的是向他解释那一件事，不过这可以等到明天再说。  
**************************************************************************************  
  
She found herself standing outside Misato's apartment. She came to the conclusion, that she has walked the route so many  
她发现自己正站在美里公寓的外面。她得出一个结论，过去这条路她走过太多次，以至于一切都变得自然而然。  
times in the past that it just came naturally to her. She pushed the door bell. That oh so familiar tune rang, followed by a  
她按下了门铃。那熟悉的旋律响起，紧接着是一张熟悉的面孔打开了门。  
familiar face opening the door.  
那张熟悉的面孔打开了门。  
  
"Good morning Asuka, Misato isn't up yet. Can I fix you some tea?"  
“早上好，明日香，美里还没起床。我给你泡点茶好吗？”  
  
"Thank you Shinji, that would be great," She stepped inside it all looked the same it was like she never left. She found  
“谢谢你，真嗣，那太好了，”她走进屋内，一切看起来都和以前一样，仿佛她从未离开过。她发现自己  
herself taking her usual seat at the kitchen table. On the table were four cans of Misato's beer. She knew that her old  
自然而然地坐在了厨房餐桌的老位置上。桌上摆着四罐美里的啤酒。她知道她以前的  
guardian wouldn't be up for at least another couple of hours.  
监护人至少还要再过几个小时才会醒来。  
  
"I see Misato still likes her beer. I guess something's never change."  
“看来美里还是喜欢她的啤酒。我想有些事情永远不会改变。”  
  
"Yes I guess so" Shinji handed the tea to her, and sat down opposite her just like he always did. She studied him. His  
“是的，我想是这样。”真嗣把茶递给她，然后像往常一样坐在她对面。她仔细打量着他。他的  
features had not changed much, just matured. He was clean shaven. She noticed his eyes mostly, and compared them to how they  
外貌变化不大，只是成熟了些。他刮干净了胡子。她主要注意到他的眼睛，与她离开时相比，  
were when she left. They were no longer cold and harsh. But had more life and warmth in them.  
它们不再冰冷严厉，而是多了几分生气和温暖。  
  
"So how's Germany? What have you been up to in these past years?"  
“那么，德国怎么样？这些年你都在忙些什么？”  
  
"Other than being on permanent standby in case of an attack, and countless sync tests, nothing much," Shinji smiled.  
“除了随时待命以防袭击，以及无数次的同步测试，没什么特别的，”真嗣微笑道。  
"What?" she asked him. “什么？”她问他。  
  
"Sounds similar to me. It kinda gets on your nerves after a while."  
“听起来和我差不多。时间久了，确实有点烦人。”  
  
"I know what you mean. Other than that, my father has been trying to rebuild a relationship with me. Says he feels guilty  
"“我明白你的意思。除此之外，我父亲一直在试图修复与我的关系。他说他感到内疚”  
about what happened. You just grin and bare it, when your made to live with him" She hated her father for abandoning her, but  
关于发生的事情。当你被迫与他同住时，只能苦笑忍受。”她恨她的父亲抛弃了她，但  
over the years she found herself pitying him instead. she had just learnt to let go.  
"随着时间的推移，她发现自己反而开始同情他。她只是学会了放手。”  
  
"Anyway enough about me. What about you? Anyone special in your life?"  
“总之，别光说我了。你呢？生活中有没有特别的人？”  
  
"No Asuka, no-one special," the young man blushed, "I told you, things haven't been the same without you around". 'Maybe he  
“没有，绫波，没有特别的人，”年轻人脸红了，“我告诉过你，你不在身边，一切都不同了。”‘也许他比我以为的还要想念我。’  
missed me more than I thought.'  
“也许他比我以为的还要想念我。”  
  
"I'm studying at the local university, but then again, that's nothing special for someone who's already been." He looked at  
“我在本地大学读书，不过对已经经历过的人来说，这也没什么特别的。”他看着  
her as though implying that he was still beneath her. 'Does he still feel so little of his own worth.' She knew that in many  
她，仿佛在暗示他仍处于她之下。‘他是否依然如此低估自己的价值。’她知道在很多  
ways, that she was beneath him.  
方面，她确实不如他。  
  
"Congratulations, on making it. I must admit I've gone back to uni myself. I was inspired by my mother. What are you  
“恭喜你，终于做到了。我得承认，我自己也重返校园了。是受我母亲的影响。你正在”  
  
studying?"  “学习什么？”  
  
"Biochemical."  “生物化学。”  
  
"That similar to me but it's called Biological systems and chemistry."  
“那和我学的类似，不过它叫生物系统和化学。”  
  
"I think they do that course at Tokyo-3 uni along side mine." She thought to herself, 'It's more likely now that I could  
“我想他们在东京-3 大学也开设了这门课，和我的一起。”她暗自思忖，‘现在更有可能转回去了。家的感觉越来越近了。’  
transfer back. Homes feeling closer all the time.'  
“转移回来。家的感觉越来越近了。”  
  
There was a noise coming from Misato's room, followed by the door opening and Misato emerging out, in her old t-shirt and  
米萨托的房间里传来一阵声响，随后门打开了，米萨托穿着她那件旧 T 恤和短裤走了出来。  
shorts. Misato let out a yawn and scratched her head. Then it seemed to dawn on her that there was another presence in the  
米萨托打了个哈欠，挠了挠头。接着，她似乎意识到公寓里还有另一个人的存在。  
  
apartment. 公寓。  
  
"Thanks for the flowers Misato, it's nice to know that you still remembered me." Misato's eyes gleamed with joy.  
“谢谢你的花，美里，很高兴知道你还记得我。”美里的眼中闪烁着喜悦的光芒。  
  
"Asuka!" With that she ran to the young woman's side, to give her the same bear hug that she gave when she left. Doing this  
“明日香！”说着，她跑到年轻女子身边，给了她一个和离开时一样的熊抱。这么做  
nearly knocked Asuka off her chair.  
差点把明日香从椅子上撞下来。  
  
"How long have you been here? How long are you staying?"  
"你在这里多久了？还要待多久？"  
  
"I arrived about two and a half hours ago. Unfortunately, I'm only staying for three more days. But I want to talk to you  
"我大约两个半小时前到的。不幸的是，我只能再待三天。但我有话想跟你说"  
about that..." 关于那个..."  
  
"Two and a half hours, why didn't you wake me?!" Misato was disappointed that no-one had given the thought to waken her.  
“两个半小时了，你怎么不叫醒我？！”美里感到失望，没有人想到要唤醒她。  
  
"You had been drinking and I thought it was for the best not to disturb you." Misato knew Shinji was telling the truth, for  
“你之前在喝酒，我想最好还是不打扰你。”美里知道真嗣说的是实话，因为  
public safety she was best not disturbed. Miasto took her place at the table and face the girl she could see in the woman who  
为了公共安全，她最好不被打扰。美里在桌前坐下，面对着那个她能在女人身上看到的女孩。  
sat before her. 坐在她面前。  
  
"What is it Asuka that you wanted to ask me?"  
“有什么事吗，明日香？你想问我什么？”  
  
"I want to come home Misato. You said I'd always have a home with you, so could you find it in your heart to find away to  
“我想回家，美里。你说过我永远有个家在你那里，所以你能找到办法让我回去吗？”

Shinji. He to was looking at Misato. He too seemed to be pleading her case.  
真嗣。他也正看着美里。他似乎也在恳求她。  
  
"Asuka, I would love for you to come back, home and live with me, and as its you, I'll see what I can do."  
"明日香，我非常希望你能回来，回家和我一起生活，既然是你，我会尽力而为。"  
  
"Thank you Misato. If NERV is worried, a new pilot is trained and a new unit built, so second branch is protected." She  
“谢谢你，美里。如果 NERV 担心的话，训练新驾驶员和建造新单位，这样第二支部就能得到保护。”她  
hoped that this would aid Misato's decision.  
希望这能帮助美里做出决定。

### Chapter 3 Can I Come Home At Last
Sliding open the door to her old room. She was surprised to find it exactly how she left it. It was not even dusty. Someone had kept it clean over the years. She placed the bag she had been carrying down, and walked over to her old desk. On it was her old laptop and beside it, the homework she had been working on before she was sent back.  
她推开旧房间的门，惊讶地发现一切都和她离开时一模一样，甚至连灰尘都没有。显然这些年有人一直在打扫。她放下手中的包，走向旧书桌。桌上放着她的旧笔记本电脑，旁边是她被送回前正在做的作业。  
  
"I kept it how you left it, just incase you came back," The voice made her jump, but she saw Shinji standing in the doorway with her other two bags.  
“我保持了原样，以防你回来，”那个声音让她吓了一跳，但看到真嗣站在门口，手里还提着她的另外两个包。  
  
"Shinji you scared the life out of me. Here, put those bags on the bed, I'll unpack them later," the young man did as he was told.  
"真嗣，你吓死我了。来，把那些包放在床上，我晚点再整理，" 年轻人照做了。  
  
"Why did you do that Shinji? Why did you keep my room this way?"  
"你为什么要这么做，真嗣？为什么要把我的房间保持原样？"  
  
"I thought that you would come back, and that you'd want your room the way you left it. And I was right, you came back as you're standing here before me," He seemed to be blushing, a timid smile gracing his features.  
"我以为你会回来，而且你会希望房间保持你离开时的样子。而我猜对了，你回来了，就像你现在站在我面前一样，" 他似乎脸红了，带着一丝羞涩的微笑。  
  
"Thank you Shinji, that was really kind of you." She walked up to him and kissed him on the cheek. Shinji turned a bright tomato red.  
"“谢谢你，真嗣，你真是太好了。”她走到他身边，在他脸颊上轻轻一吻。真嗣的脸顿时红得像熟透的番茄。”  
  
"Y..You're welcome, what was that for?"  
“不…不客气，这是为什么？”  
  
"To show my appreciation for you. I know I never did in the past. But I've had time to do some thinking, sorting out of my feelings. I've decided that I'm going to make up for all the nasty things I did Shinji..." Tears could be seen forming in her eyes.  
"“为了表达我的感激之情。我知道过去从未这样做过。但我有了时间去思考，整理我的感情。我决定要弥补我对你做过的所有坏事，真嗣……”泪水开始在她眼中打转。”  
  
" I'm so ashamed of it Shinji. So I'm trying to set things right." Seeing the tears, and the fact she was shaking with emotion, Shinji felt the old desire to protect her. He encased her in his arms trying to comfort the woman before him.  
“我为此感到非常羞愧，真嗣。所以我正努力纠正错误。”看到她的泪水和因情绪激动而颤抖的样子，真嗣心中涌起了旧日想要保护她的渴望。他紧紧抱住她，试图安慰眼前这位女子。  
  
" Don't come near me!" Shinji stood back in shock, as he released her. Here was a woman pouring her heart out but still she rejected him.  
“别靠近我！”真嗣震惊地后退，松开了她。眼前这位女子虽然倾诉心声，却依然拒绝了他。  
  
"The reason I did it Shinji was because I was afraid that you were going to hurt me, leave me like Mama did. So I thought I was doing the right thing..." Looking into her wet eyes he knew she was telling him everything right form the heart. But he could not stand the rejection and walked into the living room, and sat down on the couch.  
“我这么做的原因，真嗣，是因为我害怕你会像妈妈那样伤害我、离开我。所以我以为自己在做正确的事……”他凝视着她湿润的双眼，知道她是真心实意地向他坦白一切。但他无法忍受这种拒绝，走进客厅，坐在了沙发上。  
  
Standing there alone, once again, in her room. She realized that she had just done what she never wanted to do, pushing him away again. 'Asuka I thought you had changed,' she thought bitterly. Hearing the TV turn on in the living room she gathered her courage, and followed the noise. Seeing him sitting there with a hurt look on his face her heart sank.  
独自一人再次站在她的房间里，她意识到自己刚刚做了最不想做的事，又一次推开了他。'明日香，我以为你已经改变了，'她痛苦地想。听到客厅里电视打开的声音，她鼓起勇气，跟随那声响。看到他坐在那里，脸上带着受伤的表情，她的心沉了下去。  
  
"Shinji, I'm sorry..." He turned to look at her, the pain in his mind matched by anger.  
"真嗣，对不起..."他转过来看着她，心中的痛苦与愤怒相匹配。  
  
"No your not, I thought you had changed Asuka, but you haven't," he snarled back  
"不，你没有，我以为你已经改变了明日香，但你没有，"他咆哮着回应  
  
"Yes I have," she knew he needed to hear what she had to say, and she needed to say it for her own peace of mind.  
“是的，我有，”她知道他需要听到她的话，而她也需要说出来以平复自己的心绪。  
  
"So I'm going to say what I couldn't say back then. Shinji I love you." Relief flooded over her, all those years of waiting to tell him the truth, the guilt of driving him away, was released at the moment. She showed him that she was not the Asuka he knew from four years ago. She was that Asuka that was trapped deep inside, the one she kept hidden from everyone, even herself.  
“所以我要说出那时没能说出口的话。真嗣，我爱你。”如释重负的感觉涌上心头，那些年等待告诉他真相的时光，因驱赶他而感到的内疚，在这一刻得到了释放。她向他展示了自己不再是四年前他所认识的明日香。她是那个深藏心底、一直隐藏在所有人甚至自己面前的明日香。  
  
Shinji's eyes softened, "I should be sorry too. Sorry for not realising that you were only trying to help me after the third impact. I saw those mass production evas tear into your eva. I heard your screams, I thought I'd lost you. I love you Asuka. I thought I lost you once, and I didn't want to loose you again. But after talking to Hikari about some of your letters. Then I looked forward to the day when you came back to me. And I could tell you I love you too."  
真嗣的眼神柔和了下来，“我也应该道歉。对不起，没有意识到你只是在第三次冲击后试图帮助我。我看到那些量产型 EVA 撕裂了你的 EVA。我听到了你的尖叫，我以为我失去了你。我爱你，明日香。我曾以为我失去过你一次，我不想再失去你。但在和光聊过你的一些信件后，我开始期待你回来的那一天。那时我也能告诉你，我也爱你。”  
  
She walked over and sat down next to him. She forced herself to place her arms around him and gave him a hug. To her surprise he returned it. She finally reached the thought, this is the place I want to be. 'In Shinji's arms.' She finally felt that the pride of the past slowly begin to melt away.  
她走过去坐在他旁边，强迫自己伸出双臂拥抱他。令她惊讶的是，他回应了这个拥抱。她终于意识到，这就是她想要的地方。'在真嗣的怀里。'她终于感觉到过去的骄傲慢慢开始消融。  
  
"I plan to stay home for good this time."  
“这次我打算永远待在家里。”

### Chapter 4 This is to be My home Now
She managed to calm herself down. She lay on the couch with her head in Shinji's lap, as he gently stroked her hair.  
她设法让自己平静下来。她躺在沙发上，头枕在真嗣的腿上，他温柔地抚摸着她的头发。  
  
"Feeling better now?" he asked her in a soothing voice.  
“现在感觉好些了吗？”他用安抚的声音问她。  
  
"YES, thank you. I've been waiting to tell you that for a long time," she sat up and looked into his eyes.  
“是的，谢谢你。我等了很久，终于能告诉你这个了，”她坐起身，凝视着他的眼睛。  
  
It was him who hugged her this time, before saying, "Lets get you unpacked."  
这次是他抱住了她，然后说道：“让我们帮你把行李整理好吧。”  
  
It was late by the time she unpacked the last of her belongings. Shinji started making the dinner ten minuets ago, leaving her to put the last of her things where she wanted. She looked around, and though the room was not even near half full with her stuff, it looked as if this is where it belonged, with Shinji, who loved her. She loved him, she needed him.  
她终于整理完最后一件行李时，天色已晚。真嗣十分钟前就开始准备晚餐了，留下她把最后几样东西放到她想要的地方。她环顾四周，虽然房间里她的物品还远未填满一半，但看起来仿佛这些东西就该在这里，和真嗣在一起，他爱她。她爱他，她需要他。  
  
The front door opened and she heard Misato step in and the noise of her beer can opening, 'Just like old times,' she thought.  
前门开了，她听到美里走了进来，还有她开啤酒罐的声音，'就像往日一样，'她心想。  
  
"Dinner will be ready soon," Shinji called. She breathed in the aroma of his cooking. It was not as if she could not coook, she just could not cook the japanesse way like he could.  
“晚餐很快就好了，”真嗣喊道。她深吸了一口他烹饪的香气。并非她不会做饭，只是她做不出像他那样的日式料理。  
  
And memories come flooding back. She smiled, at the thought of the petty arguements that they used to have at dinner.  
回忆如潮水般涌来。她笑了，想起了他们过去晚餐时常有的那些小争执。  
  
"Coming!"  "来了！"  
  
Placed in front of her was a meal that smelt wonderful. She looked up at Shinji and smiled.  
摆在面前的是一盘香气扑鼻的美食。她抬头对真嗣微笑。  
  
"Smells delicous."  "闻起来真香。"  
  
"Dig in," Shinji told her. Nerves could be heard in his voice. 'That's funny,' she thought, 'I'm not going to complain, well one for the road.'  
"“开动吧，”真嗣对她说。他的声音里能听出紧张。‘真奇怪，’她想，‘我可不会抱怨，就当是上路前的最后一餐。’”  
  
"Shinji what is this! I've never tasted anything so gross!"  
“真嗣，这是什么！我从没吃过这么难吃的东西！”  
  
"Asuka...I...I,I,I.." “明日香...我...我，我，我...”  
  
"Gotcha! Sorry Shinji, I just couldn't resist." He suddenly seemed to become angry at her joke.  
“抓到你了！抱歉，真嗣，我实在忍不住。”他突然似乎对她的玩笑感到生气。  
  
"That's not exactly...."  
“那并不完全是……”  
  
"Asuka I have news about the transfer you wanted," Misato interupted and had a serious look on her face and tone to her voice. 'Please say that the commander will let me stay.'  
“明日香，我有关于你想要转学的消息，”美里打断了对话，她的脸上和语气都显得非常严肃。“请说司令会让我留下。”  
  
"I'm afraid Asuka that the commander has decided......." 'He's not going to let me come back,' she thought.  
“恐怕明日香，指挥官已经决定……”‘他不会让我回来了，’她心想。  
  
"That you can have your transfer. Welcome home." Misato broke into a smile. She could not help herself, she just had to play this one trick on her.  
“你可以调回来了。欢迎回家。”美里忍不住笑了。她就是忍不住，非得在这件事上捉弄她一下。  
  
"I'm home, I really home!" She jumped out of her chair and ran to the balcony and shouted with all her might.  
“我回来了，我真的回来了！”她从椅子上跳起来，跑到阳台上，用尽全力大喊。  
  
"I am Home!" She felt a hand on her shoulder, and it was trembling nervously.  
“我回来了！”她感到一只手搭在她的肩上，那只手紧张地颤抖着。  
  
"Welcome home," he whispered in her ear. She knew that she was home, and she was with the man she always loved. He loved her. She was with him now. She was never going to let him go again. She knew they had a lot to work out, things from the past simply cannot disapear, but she did not care right now. She sank back into his chest and placed her hand on his. She felt him tremble from her touch, but the trembling soon passed.  
“欢迎回家，”他在她耳边低语。她知道她已经回到了家，和那个她一直深爱的男人在一起。他爱她。她现在和他在一起。她再也不会让他离开。她知道他们有很多事情需要解决，过去的种种不可能轻易消失，但她现在不在乎。她靠在他的胸前，把手放在他的手上。她感觉到他的颤抖，但很快颤抖就平息了。  
  
She closed her eyes and thought. 'I'm finally home at last.'  
她闭上眼睛，心想：‘我终于回家了。’

### Comment
[dennisud](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/60065/dennisud): 
Waffiness, with sugar on top. many will say that Asuka is OOC, but I say Third Impact might have changed some of her concepts of life, the most obvious is her feelings for Shinji, and the reality that Eva was not the do all or be all of her life. Now I think a little more suborness should have been shown, but the idea that she missed him is I think right on the money, Will read chapter two now!
多数人会说明日香的角色有些不合常理，但我认为第三次冲击可能改变了她对生活的一些看法，最明显的是她对真司的感情，以及插画并不是她生活中的全部。现在我认为应该展示一些更固执的一面，但她想念他的想法我认为是非常准确的，现在要去阅读第二章了！

Ok, most ppl will say Ok, so where's the background here to justify Shinji and Asuka being so over the top nice to each other. They fought constantly even though they both had feelings for each other. There should be more of some Angst here. Also, it's kinda short. But well I'll give you some leway on that since You just a teen. I'd suggest to view the series and take nots on how each behaves then trying another story with those notes beside you.
好的，大多数人会说好的，那么这里哪里有背景信息可以证明真司和明日香对彼此如此友好。尽管他们彼此有感情，他们经常争吵。这里应该更多一些烦躁。另外，这篇有点短。但是好吧，我会对此给予一些宽容，因为你只是个十几岁的孩子。我建议观看系列动画并做好笔记，然后试着写另一个故事，把那些笔记放在身边。
