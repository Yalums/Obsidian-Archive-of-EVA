### Chapter 1: The Demon From Hell  
第一章：来自地狱的恶魔  

Disclaimer: I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion, any of the characters, or any of the stuff relating to the franchise.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，也不拥有其中的任何角色或与该系列相关的任何内容。

Rated M for: Strong Language, Violence, blood and gore (in later chapter), and adult themes.  
分级为 M，原因包括：强烈的语言、暴力、血腥和恐怖（在后续章节中），以及成人主题。

**Well I finally got around to posting my story of Evangelion. So here is the first chapter. One of the things that made NGE so interesting was the relationships between the characters. Though it was also because of the psychological aspects which made in interesting to me. I try to stick close to the core of what made it interesting by having the characters question themselves in their own minds and of course developing the love-hate relationship of Shinji and Asuka. And without further ado I give you Spawn of Adam.  
好吧，我终于抽出时间来发布我的《福音战士》故事了。以下是第一章。《新世纪福音战士》之所以引人入胜，其中一个原因在于角色之间的关系。当然，心理层面的描绘也让我觉得它非常有趣。我试图紧扣使其有趣的本质，让角色们在内心深处自我质疑，并自然地发展出真嗣和明日香之间爱恨交织的关系。废话不多说，现在就为您呈现《亚当的子嗣》。**

**Update: 12/26/14.  更新日期：12/26/14。**

**So I've long known that Spawn of Adam has its fair share of problems, from its many grammatical errors, to the early interactions between Shinji and Asuka being somewhat out of place compared to how things started to take shape. With that said, I'm gonna begin re-uploading each chapter, fixing mistakes, and overall rewriting some stuff. In this chapter in particular I've completely changed the first interaction between them so that Asuka's been toned way down compared to how she initially acted.  
我早就知道《亚当的子嗣》存在不少问题，从诸多语法错误，到真嗣和明日香早期的互动与后来逐渐成形的情节相比显得有些突兀。话虽如此，我打算开始重新上传每一章，修正错误，并整体上重写一些内容。特别是这一章，我彻底改变了他们第一次互动的情节，让明日香的行为比最初的表现要收敛得多。**

Shinji Ikari looked out the window from where he sat in his homeroom class. It had been raining for close to a week now, and the rain depicted what his mood felt like right now: miserable. Shinji had never cared much for a social life and shunned people away when they got to close to him. He preferred to sit in class and listen to his SDAT while the teacher ran through the normal, boring routine of lecturing without pause. His teacher had gotten tired of having to put up with Shinji's constant absences, and him not paying attention in class and just acted like his seat was empty. Shinji didn't care anymore whether he wanted him there or not. He just came to school and slept whenever his roommate at home became too much of a pain in the ass to deal with.  
碇真嗣坐在教室里，目光投向窗外。雨已经下了将近一周，这雨正如他此刻的心情：凄凉。真嗣向来不热衷于社交生活，每当有人试图靠近，他便避之不及。他更愿意坐在教室里，听着 SDAT，任由老师无休止地进行那枯燥乏味的讲课。他的老师早已厌倦了真嗣频繁的缺席和课堂上心不在焉的态度，仿佛他的座位空无一人。真嗣已不再在乎老师是否希望他留在那里。他来学校只是为了逃避，每当家里的室友变得难以忍受时，他就在课堂上打盹。

Shinji sighed and continued to look out the window. He had received an envelope this morning from his father stating that he would be moving the next day. That was one reason why Shinji never had a social life. His father who worked at the Nerv facilities somewhere in Tokyo-3, constantly kept his son moving from apartment to apartment not letting him stay in the same place very long. Shinji hated his father for this, and the fact that he hadn't even seen him for over a year. His father had abandoned him to go work on his stupid Nerv projects, 'Whatever those were,' thought Shinji.  
真嗣叹了口气，继续望向窗外。今早他收到了父亲的一封信，说明天就要搬家了。这也是真嗣从未有过社交生活的原因之一。在东京-3 某处 NERV 设施工作的父亲，不断让儿子从一个公寓搬到另一个公寓，不让他长时间待在同一个地方。真嗣为此憎恨父亲，更因为已经超过一年没见过他了。父亲为了那些愚蠢的 NERV 项目抛弃了他，“管它是什么呢，”真嗣心想。

He continued to look out the window when he heard the bell ring, signaling the start of lunch. 'God damn this day,' he thought. 'I wish it would just hurry up and be over with so I can go to my next home. I can just hope that it'll be better than what I'm stuck with now.'  
他继续望着窗外，这时铃声响起，标志着午餐时间的开始。“该死的今天，”他心想，“真希望它能快点结束，这样我就可以去下一个家了。我只希望它比我现在被困的地方要好。”

He was the last one to get up from his chair and walked swiftly past the teacher as he shot Shinji a scowl. 'Don't even think he bothered to write my name down on the register. Though it doesn't matter now. I'm leaving so I won't be seeing him any more.'  
他是最后一个从椅子上站起来的人，迅速走过老师身边，老师对真嗣投以怒视。“他甚至可能都没在名册上写下我的名字。不过现在无所谓了。我要离开了，不会再见到他了。”

---

Leaving the school grounds, he suddenly wished he would have just stayed put. Within minutes of exiting the school, he was soaked to the bone and his clothes felt like they were weighing him down a few extra pounds.  
离开学校后，他突然希望自己刚才没有动。刚走出校门几分钟，他就被淋得浑身湿透，衣服感觉像是重了几磅，压得他喘不过气来。

Shinji however didn't want to go home, or what he called a home right now. Later, he would get back, pack up, and simply wait for tomorrow to come. He didn't feel like facing his roommate right now. This morning they had gotten into a shouting match over last nights party that had been held. Shinji had come back from strolling the streets of Tokyo-3 to find his room a mess, empty bear bottles littering the floor, and the smell of vomit lingering. Worst of all, he was stuck disinfecting the whole place, and now just this morning he found out he was leaving.  
然而，真嗣并不想回家，或者说他现在称之为家的地方。晚些时候，他会回去收拾行李，然后简单地等待明天的到来。他现在不想面对他的室友。今早他们因为昨晚的派对吵了起来。真嗣从东京-3 的街头漫步回来，发现房间一片狼藉，满地都是空啤酒瓶，呕吐物的气味挥之不去。最糟糕的是，他不得不负责整个地方的消毒工作，而现在就在今早，他得知自己要离开了。

'Should have left the idiot to clean the mess up himself,' he thought bitterly.  
“早知道就让那傻瓜自己收拾烂摊子了。”他苦涩地想。

Most of his time spent in Tokyo-3, he had taken long walks through the streets and alleyways and he knew the place so well that he could close his eyes and walk by memory. It was one way that he used to escape the reality that he was facing. With his SDAT in hand, he would walk aimlessly through Tokyo until he found a suitable spot to fall asleep. He almost wished that his father would just let him sleep outside. At least he was more content this way.  
在东京-3 度过的多数时光里，他常常漫步于街道和巷弄之间，对这片地方了如指掌，甚至闭上眼睛也能凭记忆行走。这是他逃避现实的一种方式。手持 SDAT，他会漫无目的地穿梭于东京，直到找到一个合适的角落入睡。他几乎希望父亲能让他睡在外面，至少这样他更感满足。

He walked aimlessly for hours until he arrive at a spot that he visited often. He had arrived at the Bay of Tokyo and looked towards the sun which was just starting to set. It was stuff like this that brought him into his own world. Watching the sun, he could forget about everything and just watch until it set. Then, though he would be forced back to the sharp reality that was his life and plunged into his own misery again. 'Its not like its my fault that I'm miserable. All my father ever does is shun me from place to place.'  
他漫无目的地走了几个小时，直到来到一个常去的地方。他来到了东京湾，望着太阳刚刚开始西沉。正是这样的景象让他沉浸在自己的世界里。凝视着夕阳，他可以忘却一切，只是静静地看着它落下。然而，每当太阳沉没，他又会被迫回到那尖锐的现实生活，再次陷入自己的痛苦之中。'我这么痛苦又不是我的错。父亲总是把我从一个地方赶到另一个地方。'

'Ah, but its your decision not to connect with people,' said a small voice in his head.  
'啊，但与人建立联系是你自己的选择，'他脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'I never get a chance though. I rarely stay at the same school for three months. How the hell am I supposed to connect with people and then stay in contact with them if I move around so much?'  
“但我从未有机会。我很少在一所学校待满三个月。如果我总是四处搬家，我怎么可能与人建立联系并保持联系呢？”

The voice didn't respond as though admitting defeat.  
那个声音没有回应，仿佛承认了失败。

Shinji now laid back against the grassy shore and looked up into the sky, or what he could see of it. Many building towered over him and their tall peaks made it difficult for him to see much of the sky. He felt like they were pressing down around him. 'Damn this city,' he thought. 'There is nothing to do except get drunk, according to my roommate.' Even Shinji had to smile at that thought. 'Probably bending over the toilet right now and feeling his dinner coming up.'  
真嗣现在背靠在草地上，抬头望向天空，或者说他能看到的那部分天空。许多建筑物高耸在他周围，它们的尖顶使得他很难看到更多的天空。他感觉它们像是在他周围压迫下来。‘该死的这座城市，’他想，‘除了喝醉，我的室友说这里什么都没有。’就连真嗣想到这一点也不禁微笑。‘现在大概正弯着腰对着马桶，感受着晚餐涌上来吧。’

Shinji would have liked to continue laying their until the sun finally set but willed himself to get up. Even though he hated his roommate he thought it appropriate to tell him that he would be leaving tomorrow. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he gave one final look at the sun before he turned to go, but then did a double take.  
真嗣本想继续躺着直到太阳最终落下，但还是强迫自己起身。尽管他讨厌室友，他觉得还是应该告诉他明天自己要离开。他用力坐起身，在转身离开前最后看了一眼夕阳，却突然愣住了。

He wasn't sure how long they had been there, but someone was down by the water looking out across the ocean. Shinji squinted his eyes trying to make out who could be down there. Standing up he looked again and saw that it was a girl and she must have been close to his age. She had long red hair that came down to the middle of her back, and her hair was separating into three parts thanks to the hair clips that she wore. She was wearing a simple yellow dress that was blowing against the wind. The contrast between herself and the setting sun in front of her was almost blinding. It was almost as though that fiery red hair and sun dress magnified herself and the sun so that she gave off an eerie orange glow. Shinji wasn't sure what made him do it but he stood there for sometime watching the back of her. He had a sudden urge to go down there and find out who she was, but then shook his head.  
他不确定他们在那里待了多久，但有人在水边眺望着大海。真嗣眯起眼睛试图辨认出那会是谁。他站起来再次望去，发现那是个女孩，年龄应该和他相仿。她有着一头长长的红发，垂至背部中间，发丝因佩戴的发夹而分成三股。她穿着一件简单的黄色连衣裙，随风飘扬。她与前方夕阳的对比几乎令人目眩。仿佛那火红的头发和太阳裙将她与太阳放大，散发出一种诡异的橙色光芒。真嗣不确定是什么驱使他这样做，但他站在那里凝视着她的背影。他突然有种冲动想走下去，弄清楚她是谁，但随即摇了摇头。

"No point," he said softly. "Tomorrow I'll be gone again so theres no point in finding out who she is."  
“没意义，”他轻声说，“明天我又将离开，所以没必要知道她是谁。”

Giving her back one last look he turned and walked back towards his soon to be old apartment. Though the thought of the setting sun and her was constantly on his mind for the rest of the night.  
最后看了一眼她的背影，他转身走回即将成为旧公寓的地方。尽管夕阳和她一直萦绕在他的脑海中，直到深夜。

---

Shinji woke up the next morning and waited outside his roommates door. When he had come home last night he had found him sleeping on the couch passed out. Deciding that he would just wait till the next morning, he had packed what little things he owned, and went to sleep.  
第二天早上，真嗣醒来后便站在室友的房门外等候。昨晚回家时，他发现室友醉倒在沙发上睡着了。决定等到第二天早上再说，他收拾了自己仅有的几样东西，便去睡了。

Now he was leaning against his roommates door with his bag in his hand waiting for him to get up. Shinji sighed and looked down at his watch. He was supposed to meet this Misato Katsuragi in the next few hours. Shinji frowned at the name of this unidentified person. From the sound of it she was a women, and Shinji hadn't had a woman as a roommate, yet.  
现在，他倚靠在室友的房门上，手里提着包，等待对方起床。真嗣叹了口气，低头看了看手表。他应该在接下来的几个小时内与这位葛城美里见面。真嗣对这个未曾谋面的人的名字皱了皱眉。听起来她是个女性，而真嗣还从未与女性同住过。

'Well, anything is probably better than what I'm stuck with right now,' he thought.  
“嗯，不管怎样，总比我现在的情况要好吧，”他心想。

Sighing again he slumped down into a sitting position and leaned his head against the door.  
他又叹了口气，颓然坐下，将头靠在门上。

'Ah hurry the hell up, he thought. 'I wanna get this over with.'  
'啊，快点吧，'他心想，'我想赶紧结束这事。'

Shinji wasn't sure how long he sat there waiting for his roommate to wake up, but it must have been at least half an hour. Feeling that he was starting to get drowsy from sitting there for so long, he stood up and turned to face the door. 'Enough. I'm getting his ass up.'  
真嗣不确定自己坐在那里等室友醒来有多久了，但至少有半个小时。感觉自己因为坐得太久而开始犯困，他站起身来，转向门。'够了。我要把他叫起来。'

He swung the door open about to tell his roommate to get the hell up. He was shocked to see that the bed was empty and seemed to have been for several hours.  
他猛地推开门，正准备叫室友起床。却惊讶地发现床上空无一人，似乎已经离开好几个小时了。

"What the hell. This is the first time I've known him to get up early."  
“搞什么鬼。这是我第一次知道他早起。”

Shinji looked at his watch again and knew that he wouldn't be able to tell him in person.  
真嗣再次看了看手表，知道无法当面告诉他了。

"I guess I'll just leave him a note telling him I've left. I'm sure he wont care. He's been talking about having his girlfriend start sleeping over."  
"我想我会给他留张字条，告诉他我已经走了。我肯定他不会在乎的。他一直在说要让他的女朋友开始留宿。"

Shinji looked around and realized how weird it was that he was talking about this out loud to himself and suddenly felt lonely. At least he had had someone to talk to, but now...  
真嗣环顾四周，意识到自己大声谈论这件事有多奇怪，突然感到孤单。至少他曾经有个人可以交谈，但现在...

"It'll work out," he said. Then shook his head and thought, 'I've got to stop talking out loud, its weird."  
"会好起来的，"他说。然后摇了摇头想，'我得停止自言自语，这太奇怪了。"

Walking over to the table he tore off a piece of paper on the notepad that was sitting there and rummaged in his bag to find a pen that would work. Finding one that was suitable he hastily scribbled a quick message about where he was going.  
他走到桌前，从放在那里的便签本上撕下一张纸，然后在包里翻找能用的笔。找到一支合适的笔后，他匆忙地草草写下他要去哪里的信息。

Hey, I see you woke up early, odd. Anyway I'm leaving finally and thought that I should at least tell you about it. I think I told you that I might get moved again by my father, but you might not have been sober at the time. Well, I'm finally leaving now so you don't have to worry about me upsetting your girlfriend when she's over.  
嘿，我看到你早起了，真奇怪。不管怎样，我终于要走了，觉得至少应该告诉你一声。我可能跟你说过我爸可能又要搬家，但当时你可能还没清醒。好吧，我现在真的要走了，这样你就不用担心我会在你女朋友来的时候惹她不高兴了。

Shinji paused here and remembered when he had walked in on the two of them making love. The thought of that still brought stomach acid up his esophagus. Not sure how to finish it now he simply signed his name at the end of it and carried it into his room and placed it on his futon.  
真嗣在这里停顿了一下，回想起他无意中撞见他们做爱的情景。一想到那个，他仍感到胃酸涌上食道。不确定现在该如何结束，他简单地在末尾签上名字，然后拿着纸条走进房间，放在他的被褥上。

Walking back into what was considered the living room, he gave everything one last look before he turned his back on his old home and walked out the door.  
他再次走进被视为客厅的地方，在转身离开旧家之前，他最后环顾了一眼四周，然后走出了门。

---

Shinji walked the quickest way to get to his destination. He had a little under forty-five minutes to get to this cafe where he was supposed to me Misato. Taking many short cuts down alleyways and old gravel roads, he paused for a minute against a street sign catching his breath. His SDAT had repeated itself several times over now and he pulled the earphones out of his ear getting bored with the music.  
真嗣以最快的路线赶往目的地。他还有不到四十五分钟的时间到达那家咖啡馆，他要在那里与美里见面。他穿过许多小巷和老碎石路，抄了近路，在一根路标旁停下来喘口气。他的 SDAT 已经重复播放了好几次，他感到无聊，便把耳机从耳朵里取了出来。

Stuffing it back in his bag he straightened up and swung his bag over his shoulder and continued on to the cafe.  
他把 SDAT 塞回包里，挺直身子，将包甩到肩上，继续向咖啡馆走去。

When Shinji arrived his first impression of it was one of disgust. It was tucked away in a corner of the street and looked as though it was reserved for only the poor. Now though that Shinji looked around he saw that he was in one of the old slums of Tokyo-3. It looked like a shack more than anything. The sign which hung over the front of the cafe was slightly lopsided and the nails that held it to the wood where rusted and obviously strained from the weight on the metal sign. The roof looked as though it had suffered many a battering from past storms and some of the shingles were missing. Shinji figured that it smelled like rot and mold inside and decided to wait outside. Or he felt that he would be mimicking his old roommate and vomiting.  
当真嗣到达时，他对这个地方的第一印象是厌恶。它蜷缩在街道的一角，看起来似乎只留给穷人。然而现在，当真嗣环顾四周，他发现自己身处东京-3 的老旧贫民窟中。它看起来更像是一个棚屋。悬挂在咖啡馆前方的招牌略微倾斜，固定它的钉子锈迹斑斑，显然因金属招牌的重量而承受着压力。屋顶看起来经历过多次暴风雨的摧残，有些瓦片已经缺失。真嗣猜测里面弥漫着腐烂和霉菌的气味，决定在外面等待。或者，他觉得自己可能会模仿旧室友，呕吐起来。

Sitting himself down on the edge of the sidewalk he waited there for Misato to pick him up and take him away to whatever place she came from. Shinji started feeling drowsy again and tried to keep himself awake, but to no avail.  
他坐在人行道边缘，等待美里来接他，带他去她来自的任何地方。真嗣又开始感到困倦，试图保持清醒，但无济于事。

It was sometime later when Shinji awoke to the sound of a car engine. It sounded like it was in agony and if it had voice Shinji knew it would be screaming. Pushing himself up into a sitting position he looked to his left where he thought he heard the sound coming from. Suddenly he saw a blue spec speeding towards him.  
过了一段时间，真嗣被汽车引擎的声音吵醒。那声音听起来像是在痛苦中挣扎，如果引擎能说话，真嗣知道它一定会尖叫。他撑起身子坐起来，朝他认为声音传来的左边看去。突然间，他看到一个蓝色的小点正飞速向他逼近。

'Shit,' he thought. 'That drivers crazy. If I don't move out of the way I'm gonna have my feet flattened into pancake.'  
“该死，”他想，“那司机疯了。如果我不躲开，我的脚就要被压成肉饼了。”

Rolling over so that he was several feet away from the curb he was suddenly glad that he had done so. The car hadn't slowed at all and only stopped when its two wheels on its right side struck the curb and ran up along it. If Shinji hadn't backed away as far as he had, he would have been pulled under the car.  
他翻滚着离开路边几英尺远，突然庆幸自己这么做了。那辆车完全没有减速，直到右侧的两个轮子撞上路边并沿着它行驶才停下来。如果真嗣没有及时后退，他就会被卷到车底下。

Shinji felt something trickling down his arm now and looked down to see that in his haste to get out of the way he had skinned his elbow. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'Thanks to this crazy driver I'm bleeding now.'  
真嗣感觉到有什么东西顺着他的手臂流下来，低头一看，发现自己因为急于躲避而擦伤了手肘。'真倒霉，'他想，'都怪这个疯狂的司机，我现在流血了。'

Standing up slowly, he brushed the dust off his pants and shirt and now looked at his elbow. His elbow was tinged with gravel and dirt and was starting to sting a little bit. Kneeling down he reached for his bag to take a cloth out when someone grabbed his hand. He turned around slowly to see the driver of the blue car looking at him with a worried look in her eyes.  
他慢慢地站起来，拍掉裤子和衬衫上的灰尘，然后看向自己的手肘。手肘沾满了碎石和泥土，开始有点刺痛。他跪下来伸手去拿包里的布，这时有人抓住了他的手。他缓缓转过身，看到蓝色汽车的司机正用担忧的眼神看着他。

"Your not bleeding are you?"  
“你没流血吧？”

Shinji thought it would have been rude to state the obvious and make her feel ashamed and simply shrugged it off as though it was no big deal.  
真嗣认为直接指出这一点会显得很无礼，让她感到羞愧，于是他只是耸了耸肩，好像没什么大不了的。

"You are bleeding aren't you? Oh God I'm so sorry. I was just so late that I was forced to speed most of the way here, and I didn't see you and wasn't able to stop in time."  
“你流血了，对吧？哦天哪，真对不起。我太迟了，不得不一路加速赶来，没看到你，也没能及时停下来。”

She walked back to her car and opened the glove compartment and pulled out a simple first aid kit. Shinji thought this was going a bit far and opened his mouth to say so but she simply shook her head.  
她走回自己的车，打开手套箱，拿出一个简易急救包。真嗣觉得这有点过头了，正要开口说，但她只是摇了摇头。

"Its my fault that you're injured so let me do this."  
“你受伤是我的错，所以让我来处理吧。”

Shinji simply shrugged again and let her tend to his elbow. Then he felt the stinging grow stronger and had a sudden urge to yell out. He looked down and saw that she was rubbing his elbow with a small cloth that he suspected had alcohol on it. Looking away quickly so she wouldn't see the painful expression on his face. It was an odd feeling that he wasn't able to express. It almost felt like something a mother would do. Though he wasn't sure what a mother was like, since his had died when he had been young. Thoughts of his mother led to his father and he felt boiling hatred surge through him.  
真嗣只是再次耸了耸肩，任由她处理他的手肘。随后，他感到刺痛感愈发强烈，突然有种想要大叫的冲动。他低头一看，发现她正用一块小布擦拭他的手肘，他怀疑那布上沾了酒精。他迅速移开视线，以免她看到他脸上的痛苦表情。这是一种他无法表达的奇怪感觉，几乎像是母亲会做的事情。尽管他不确切知道母亲是什么样的，因为他的母亲在他年幼时就去世了。想到母亲，他不禁想起了父亲，一股沸腾的恨意涌上心头。

This stranger must have seen this and asked if he was all right. Shinji nodded and thought that he should at least thank her for what she was trying to make up for what she had done.  
这位陌生人一定察觉到了这一点，便问他是否还好。真嗣点点头，心想至少应该感谢她，因为她正试图弥补她所造成的伤害。

"Hey...um...thanks for well...helping..."  
"嘿...嗯...谢谢你...帮忙..."

"No problem," she smiled. "Its all my fault anyway so I feel responsible for cleaning it."  
"没事的，" 她微笑着说。"反正都是我的错，所以我有责任清理干净。"

"Thanks," Shinji mumbled again.  
"谢谢，" 真嗣又咕哝了一声。

The female stranger responded by putting a bandage over Shinji's scrape. Shinji now raised his elbow looked at it. It still stung a little, but at least it was clean. He could see that some blood was trying to seep through the bandage and knew he'd have to change it later.  
那位女陌生人用一个创可贴覆盖了真嗣的擦伤。真嗣抬起手肘看了看，虽然还有点刺痛，但至少干净了。他能看到有些血迹试图透过创可贴渗出来，知道稍后得更换它。

Looking over at the female driver he finally got a good look at her face. She seemed to be in her mid to late twenties. She had long purple hair that was tied back in a pony tail and on top of her head she had a pair of sun glasses. 'Way to young to be my mother,' thought Shinji. Then he looked at her chest and was surprised to see a Nerv I.D. badge pinned to her jacket which he now saw had the Nerv emblem of a leaf embedded on the shoulder.  
他转头看向那位女司机，终于看清了她的脸。她看起来二十多岁，有着一头紫色的长发，扎成马尾，头上还戴着一副太阳镜。'年纪太小了，不可能是我妈妈，'真嗣心想。然后他注意到她的胸前别着一个 NERV 的身份证章，现在他才看到她的夹克肩部嵌有 NERV 的叶子标志。

"Look I'm really sorry about what happened just now. I just..."  
“听着，我真的很抱歉刚才发生的事。我只是……”

"Don't worry so much about it. You've more than made up for what just happened." Shinji now gave her a small smile that she returned somewhat forcefully.  
"别太担心了。你已经远远弥补了刚才发生的事。" 真嗣现在给了她一个微笑，她也有些用力地回应了他。

Shinji surprised himself at the bluntness of his next question. "You don't happen to work at Nerv do you?"  
真嗣对自己接下来问题的直率感到惊讶。"你不会正好在 NERV 工作吧？"

The female driver frowned at him. "I didn't know many people knew about the existence of Nerv."  
女司机皱着眉看着他。"我没想到很多人都知道 NERV 的存在。"

"Well, the badge is in full few and you've got the emblem on your jacket. So it was a little bit obvious."  
"嗯，徽章闪闪发亮，你的夹克上也有标志。所以稍微有点明显。"

"How do you know so much? Do you know someone who works there?"  
"你怎么知道这么多？你认识那里工作的人吗？"

"Err yeah. My father does, at least, last time I talked to him he did. Though that was about a year ago."  
"呃，是的。我父亲在那儿工作，至少上次我跟他通话时是这样。虽然那已经是大约一年前的事了。"

"Your father," said the female driver now with a shocked look on her face.  
"你父亲，"女司机此刻脸上露出震惊的表情。

"I think so. Why you don't know him do you?"  
"我想是的。你怎么会不认识他呢？"

"Wait," she paused. "Your last name doesn't happen to be Ikari does it?"  
"等等，"她停顿了一下。"你的姓氏该不会是碇吧？"

"Yeah it does," said Shinji just as surprised.  
“是啊，确实如此，”真嗣同样感到惊讶地说道。

Suddenly the female driver sat down on the curb next to him and laughed out. This shocked Shinji more than anything that had happened so far that day. Her mood immediately changed from concerned to one of complete laxness. She suddenly hit him rather hard on the back, looked at him again, and laughed.  
突然，女司机坐在了他旁边的路边，放声大笑。这让真嗣比那天发生的任何事情都更加震惊。她的情绪立刻从关切转变为完全的放松。她突然重重地拍了一下他的背，再次看着他，又笑了起来。

"So I take it you know my dad?"  
“这么说，你认识我爸爸？”

"Know him. Everyone in Nerv knows who your father is. I work for him. He's the man thats in charge of Nerv. Gendo Ikari is well known for his experiments with-"  
"认识他。NERV 里的每个人都知道你父亲是谁。我为他工作。他是 NERV 的负责人。碇源堂因其与……"

She cut herself off and Shinji looked back at her rather blankly.  
她突然停了下来，真嗣茫然地回头看着她。

"Well," she said. "This makes my job a lot easier. Though I never would have thought that I'd almost run you over. I was a bit worried that you would have gotten tired of waiting for me."  
"好吧，"她说。"这让我的工作轻松多了。虽然我从没想过会差点撞到你。我还担心你会等得不耐烦呢。"

Shinji frowned at her, "You act as though you were planning to meet with...wait," and here Shinji turned to her and his eyes widened slightly. "You don't happen to be Misato Katsuragi."  
真嗣皱着眉头看着她，"你表现得好像是计划去见...等等，"说到这里，真嗣转向她，眼睛微微睁大。"你该不会就是葛城美里吧。"

She simply winked at him and said, "Bingo Shinji."  
她只是向他眨了眨眼，说："答对了，真嗣。"

Shinji was surprised but also felt happy with the change of circumstances. "So I take it that I'll be living with you for a while," he asked.  
真嗣感到惊讶，但也对情况的转变感到高兴。"那么，我是不是要和你一起住一段时间？"他问道。

"That appears to be so."  
"看来确实如此。"

Shinji suddenly felt happier than he could last remember. She didn't seem all that much like an adult now that she knew who he was but he didn't seem to care. He was just happy that he seemed to be able to talk with her easily.  
真嗣突然感到比他最近记忆中的任何时候都要快乐。她现在知道他是谁了，看起来并不那么像一个成年人，但他似乎并不介意。他只是很高兴能和她轻松地交谈。

"Well," she said standing up. "Now that I found you I suggest that we head back to my apartment and get you settled in." She looked at the bag that was sitting next to him. "I take it thats all the stuff you own."  
"好吧，"她站起身来说道，"既然我找到了你，我建议我们回我的公寓，让你安顿下来。"她看了看他旁边的包，"我想这就是你所有的东西了吧。"

Shinji looked down and nodded. It wasn't a whole lot of stuff. Most of it he had had for several years and he needed to get some new clothes. His old ones were starting to get too small.  
真嗣低头看了看，点了点头。东西并不多。大部分他已经用了好几年，需要添置些新衣服了。旧的已经开始显得太小了。

"Well, I think that I'll have to take you shopping sometime so you can get whatever you like. I take it you haven't had many choices to choose what you want."  
“嗯，我想我得找个时间带你去购物，这样你可以买到你喜欢的任何东西。我猜你之前没多少选择自己想要的东西的机会吧。”

Shinji continued to look down and mumbled a barely audible 'no.'  
真嗣继续低着头，用几乎听不见的声音咕哝了一声‘没有’。

Misato looked at him and felt a small smile appear on her face. Tapping him slightly on the shoulder she gestured for him to put his stuff in the back, which he did.  
美里看着他，脸上不由自主地露出了微笑。她轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀，示意他把东西放到后面去，他照做了。

"OK," she said. "Next stop my apartment. And I'll try not to drive too sporadically so you don't feel sick."  
“好，”她说，“下一站是我的公寓。我会尽量平稳驾驶，免得你晕车。”

At this point Shinji was just happy to have found somebody that seemed to care about him.  
此时，真嗣只是庆幸自己找到了一个似乎关心他的人。

---

Whatever Misato Katsuragi was, she was not clean. Navigating through the mess that was her apartment was almost impossible. Shinji took a small room adjacent to another room that was currently empty. He had thought about asking why he wasn't using that one, but decided it was best not to be rude. She was giving him a place to sleep after all.  
无论米萨托·卡苏拉基是什么样的人，她绝不是个整洁的人。穿越她那乱糟糟的公寓几乎是不可能的任务。真嗣住进了一个紧邻另一间空房间的小房间。他本想问为什么不让他住那间，但觉得还是不要失礼为好。毕竟，她给了他一个睡觉的地方。

One thing that he hadn't been expecting about her was the fact that she drank a lot of beer. Upon opening the fridge to get something to drink, he saw more six packs of beer than what had been at his old roommates place. Shinji wasn't sure whether to laugh, or feel annoyed and simply closed it and got water out of the tap.  
有一件事他没料到，那就是她喝很多啤酒。打开冰箱想找点喝的，他发现啤酒六包装的数量比他以前的室友那儿还多。真嗣不确定是该笑，还是感到恼火，最后他只是关上冰箱，从水龙头接了水喝。

Misato had to go back to work almost immediately when they had gotten back and said that she wouldn't be back until later in the afternoon. She said that she would tell his father that she had picked him up, and that now he was now living in her apartment. Shinji was guessing that his father didn't care. As long as he wasn't bothering him at all.  
米萨托几乎一回来就得立刻回去工作，她说下午晚些时候才能回来。她告诉他，她会通知他父亲已经把他接来了，现在他住在她的公寓里。真嗣猜想他父亲并不在乎。只要他不打扰他就行。

Shinji had gotten tired of the bottles of beer and bags of junk food littering the floor and decided to do clean the apartment. From what he saw, she mainly ate take out or instant meals.  
真嗣对满地的啤酒瓶和垃圾食品袋感到厌倦，决定打扫一下公寓。从他看到的来看，她主要吃外卖或速食。

'Well, good thing I taught myself how to cook these past years,' thought Shinji.  
'还好这几年我自学了烹饪，'真嗣心想。

Finished with the cleaning, he proceeded to take a shower but opened the wrong door and found himself face to face with a penguin. Shinji let out a loud yell that could be heard several floors down as he backed up to the fridge reaching for a blunt object. The penguin simply looked back at him blinking at him sleepily. Yawning widely the penguin grasped a hold of the sliding door and closed it once again, but not before giving a loud squawk in Shinji's direction  
打扫完毕后，他去洗澡，却误开了另一扇门，迎面撞见一只企鹅。真嗣惊声尖叫，声音响彻几层楼，他后退到冰箱旁，伸手去拿钝器。企鹅只是睡眼惺忪地眨眼看着他。打了个大大的哈欠，企鹅抓住推拉门再次关上，临走前还朝真嗣的方向发出一声响亮的鸣叫。

Shinji's heart was beating faster than he could last remember. 'What the hell is that woman thinking. Keeping a penguin in an environment like this.' Now though he wondered if the penguin had some bit of intelligence in it and decided to ask her later.  
真嗣的心跳比他记忆中任何时候都要快。'那个女人到底在想什么。在这种环境下养企鹅。' 不过现在他好奇那只企鹅是否有些许智慧，决定稍后再问她。

Sighing slightly he walked to the correct bathroom this time, stripped quickly, and was pleased to feel the hot water hitting his skin. For no apparent reason, his thoughts strayed to last night when he had seen that girl down by the shore against the setting sun. If he knew that things would have happened like this and he would be staying in Tokyo-3, then he would have asked her name at least. Though now it seemed that he wouldn't see her again. "Wonder what she's like..." He wondered out loud.  
他轻叹一声，这次走向了正确的浴室，迅速脱掉衣服，感受着热水洒在皮肤上的舒适。不知为何，他的思绪飘到了昨晚，他在海边看到那个女孩，夕阳映衬着她的身影。如果他早知道事情会变成这样，他会留在第三新东京市，至少会问她的名字。但现在看来，他可能再也见不到她了。“不知道她是什么样的人...”他自言自语道。

Suddenly he hit his head against the wall of the shower. Certain thoughts had just crossed his mind and he didn't quite appreciate them. He didn't even know who she was. Hadn't even seen her face for that matter. 'Stop thinking like that you idiot. The chances of seeing her again are almost nil.'  
突然间，他的头撞到了淋浴间的墙上。某些念头刚刚闪过他的脑海，他并不喜欢这些想法。他甚至不知道她是谁，连她的脸都没看清。'别再这么想了，你这个傻瓜。再见到她的可能性几乎为零。'

Turning off the hot water before anything else crossed his mind, he wrapped a towel around his waist and walked to his bedroom to change.  
他首先关掉了热水，然后围上一条毛巾，走向卧室换衣服。

Misato didn't come home until late at night. Shinji had fallen asleep in his new room with his SDAT waiting for her to come home. He awoke when he heard her stumbling around the kitchen and slid his door open a little to see her looking in the fridge for something.  
美里直到深夜才回家。真嗣在他的新房间里睡着了，SDAT 播放器还在等着她回来。听到她在厨房里跌跌撞撞的声音，他醒了过来，轻轻拉开房门，看到她在冰箱里找东西。

"Misato-san, you're home later than you said you would be."  
“美里小姐，你回来得比说的要晚呢。”

"Oh sorry Shinji. I had some things I had to take care of. Thanks for cleaning up around her. I've been meaning to, but I just don't have enough time."  
“哦，抱歉，真嗣。我有些事情需要处理。谢谢你帮她打扫。我一直想做，但就是没时间。”

Shinji highly doubted that she would have cleaned, even if she had a week of nothing to do, but he didn't care. It kept him occupied at least when he had nothing to do.  
真嗣高度怀疑即使她有一周的空闲时间，她也不会打扫，但他并不在意。至少在他无所事事时，这让他有事可做。

Sitting down in a chair next to her, he frowned when he saw that she had a can of beer in her hand. Even though Shinji was only fifteen he knew that drinking before bed wasn't the smartest thing to do, and opened his mouth to say something when she cut across him.  
他坐在她旁边的椅子上，看到她手里拿着一罐啤酒时皱起了眉头。尽管真嗣只有十五岁，但他知道睡前喝酒不是明智之举，正要开口说些什么时，她打断了他。

"I talked to your father and he wanted me to tell you something."  
"我和你父亲谈过了，他有些话让我转告你。"

Shinji wasn't it the mood to listen to anything that his father felt worthwhile but simply nodded.  
真嗣此刻并无心情听父亲认为有价值的事，只是简单地点了点头。

"He wants you to continue going to the school your currently attending."  
"他希望你继续在目前就读的学校学习。"

Shinji was surprised at this. "Does he want to keep me here for a while or something?"  
真嗣对此感到惊讶。“他是想让我在这里待一段时间吗？”

"Can't say," said Misato taking a huge gulp of beer.  
“不好说，”美里说着，猛灌了一大口啤酒。

"I met that penguin of yours but the way," said Shinji.  
“我顺便见到了你的那只企鹅，”真嗣说道。

Misato raised an eyebrow at him and put her beer down. "Forgot that I hadn't shown Pen-Pen to you yet. He didn't attack you or anything did he?"  
美里对他挑了挑眉，放下手中的啤酒。“忘了我还没带你见过 Pen-Pen 呢。他没攻击你吧？”

"No. Seemed like I woke him up though, but he just went back to sleep."  
“没有。不过我好像把他吵醒了，但他只是又睡回去了。”

"Just like him." She finished her beer and belched rather unladylike. She was a lot different than what he had expected.  
“他就这样。”她喝完啤酒，打了个相当不淑女的嗝。她和他的预期大相径庭。

"I'm going to bed now. I expect you to go to school like a good boy tomorrow. Make sure you do go, or you'll have to answer to me."  
"我现在要去睡觉了。我希望你明天能像个乖孩子一样去上学。一定要去，否则你得向我解释。"

Shinji chuckled, "You sound like a mother."  
真嗣轻笑道：“你听起来像个妈妈。”

"I'm now your guardian so its only natural that I look after you."  
"我现在是你的监护人，所以照顾你是理所当然的。"

Shinji blinked and felt tears forming in his eyes and hastily wiped them away with the back of his hand.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，感觉泪水在眼眶中形成，急忙用手背擦去。

"Well, I'll see you tomorrow Shinji, good night."  
“那么，明天见，真嗣，晚安。”

"Yeah, good night Misato."  
“嗯，晚安，美里。”

---

When Shinji arrived at school the next day whispers followed him wherever he went. Apparently most of the kids had thought he had finally dropped out. They were therefore surprised to see him there the next day. True to his word Shinji, didn't even bring his SDAT so that it wouldn't distract him. Now that he had a place that he could happily call home he felt like putting more of an effort into his school work, even if the other kids didn't believe him.  
第二天，当真嗣踏入学校时，耳边传来的窃窃私语如影随形。显然，大多数孩子都以为他终于退学了。因此，看到他第二天出现在学校，他们都感到惊讶。正如他承诺的那样，真嗣甚至没有带上他的 SDAT，以免分心。现在他有了一个可以称之为家的温馨之地，他觉得自己应该更加努力学习，即使其他孩子不相信他。

His teacher still didn't think that he was trying seriously though, and ignored him for most of the day. The morning passed without much of a difference in what Shinji was normally used to, and he was just thinking of going home when there teacher addressed them.  
尽管如此，他的老师仍然认为他没有认真对待学习，大部分时间都忽视了他。上午的时光与真嗣平常所经历的并无太大差别，正当他想着回家时，老师向他们讲话了。

"We have a new student that will be joining us today. She is an exchange student from Germany and she can speak Japanese fluently. She has also graduated from a German university at the age of fourteen and is extremely brilliant."  
“我们今天有一位新同学加入。她是从德国来的交换生，日语说得非常流利。她在十四岁时就从德国的一所大学毕业，极其聪明。”

He looked up from the piece of paper that he was reading from and looking towards the door. "Is that it then?" he asked with a slight annoyed tone in his voice?  
他从正在阅读的纸张上抬起头，望向门口。“就这样了吗？”他带着一丝不悦的语气问道？

"Yeah, thats enough," said an energetic voice from the other side of the door leading out into the hallway.  
“是的，够了，”门外走廊传来一个充满活力的声音。

Shinji was starring out the window and was only picking up about half of this. 'Just another annoying girl like the rest of them,' he thought.  
真嗣正望着窗外，只听进了一半的内容。'不过是又一个像其他女孩一样烦人的家伙，'他心想。

Again there teacher starting talking but the girl had cut across him now. "I can introduce myself," she said.  
老师再次开始讲话，但女孩此刻打断了他。“我可以自我介绍，”她说。

Even though Shinji wasn't paying attention to what was going on he could tell that a change in the room had happened. All the guys around him had started whispering all at once and Shinji could only assume that it had something to do with the new girl.  
尽管真嗣没有注意周围发生的事情，但他能感觉到房间里发生了变化。他周围的男生们突然同时开始窃窃私语，真嗣只能猜测这与新来的女孩有关。

The girl had started talking again either oblivious to the muttering of the guys or simply enjoying it.  
女孩又开始说话了，无论是对男生们的低语浑然不觉，还是单纯地享受着这种氛围。

Shinji heard the light tapping of chalk against the board and now heard her start talking again though this time he was paying attention enough to at least get her name.  
真嗣听到粉笔轻敲黑板的声音，现在又听到她开始讲话了，这次他至少注意到了她的名字。

"My name is Asuka Langely Soryu. Pleasure to meet all of you."  
“我叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷。很高兴见到大家。”

All at once their was a massive babbling from all the guys except Shinji who was once again ignoring the whole thing. Asuka had questions launched at her from all over the place and she couldn't help but smirk as all the guys fawned over her.  
一瞬间，除了真嗣外，所有男生都开始七嘴八舌起来。明日香被四面八方的问题轰炸，忍不住对那些围着她献殷勤的男生们露出得意的笑容。

It took sometime for there teacher to get everyone quieted down. When he had yelled at several guys who had tried to get her phone number and threatened several others to send them to the principles office, he told Asuka to take the empty seat in front of Shinji.  
花了些时间，老师才让所有人安静下来。他对着几个试图要她电话号码的男生大吼，又威胁要把其他几个人送到校长办公室，然后让 Asuka 坐在 Shinji 前面的空位上。

Shinji only caught this last part and sighed slightly. From the sound of this girl, she thought that she was superior to everyone else. He would have preferred to just continue looking out the window, but saw that somebody was standing over him.  
Shinji 只听到了最后这部分，微微叹了口气。从这女孩的语气来看，她自认为高人一等。他本想继续望着窗外，却注意到有人站在他面前。

Looking away from the window he came face to face with Asuka, who was starring back at him. The entire classroom had gone quiet and Shinji felt his heart stop as soon as he looked into her face.  
他转过视线，不再看向窗外，迎面遇上了 Asuka 的目光，她正盯着他。整个教室都安静了下来，Shinji 一看到她的脸，心跳仿佛都停止了。

'No way,' he thought. 'She can't be, but...no its gotta be her.'  
“不可能，”他心想，“她不可能是，但……不，肯定是她。”

He was looking up into the face of the girl he had seen on the beach. Her hair was the correct color and Shinji confirmed that it was her when he saw the hair clips that she had in her hair. His eyes strayed to her face and saw that she had blue eyes which seemed to be rather stern. He couldn't believe that he was looking into the face of her, and that he also knew her name now. What's more she was looking at him rather intently and curiously. 'This is awkward,' thought Shinji as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.  
他抬头看着那个在海滩上见过的女孩的脸。她的发色完全吻合，当看到她头发上的发夹时，真嗣确认了就是她。他的目光移到她的脸上，发现她有着相当严肃的蓝色眼睛。他不敢相信自己正凝视着她的脸，而且现在还知道了她的名字。更甚的是，她正相当专注且好奇地看着他。“这真尴尬，”真嗣想着，额头上冒出了汗珠。

Suddenly she put her hand out and flicked her forefinger against his forehead making him flinch slightly. Shinji wasn't sure what to make of this behavior. Was she teasing him, or what?  
突然，她伸出手，用食指弹了一下他的额头，让他微微一缩。真嗣不确定她这是什么意思。是在逗他吗，还是别的什么？

Suddenly their teacher cleared his throat slightly and Asuka turned around to frown at him. Shinji's eyes strayed over her again taking her in. Shinji felt that if he continued to stare at her, he would start having strange thoughts again, and quickly turned his gaze back to the window. Asuka saw this and now there was a very annoyed look on her face. She turned her back on him and sat down in front of him.  
突然，他们的老师轻轻清了清喉咙，明日香转过身来皱眉看着他。真嗣的目光再次掠过她，细细打量。真嗣觉得如果继续盯着她看，他又会开始产生奇怪的想法，于是迅速将视线转回窗外。明日香看到这一幕，脸上露出了非常不悦的表情。她转过身背对着他，坐在他前面。

Shinji could hear the muttering of the fellow males in his classroom all discussing what had just happened between the two. "Why does he get to sit behind her?"  
真嗣能听到教室里其他男生在窃窃私语，讨论着刚才两人之间发生的事情。"为什么他能坐在她后面？"

"And why did she flick his forehead? Do they know each other from somewhere?"  
“还有，她为什么弹他的额头？他们是不是在哪儿认识？”

Shinji was getting annoyed at this, and saw that in front of him Asuka was steadily turning red.  
这让真嗣感到恼火，他看到前方的明日香正逐渐涨红了脸。

However the teacher started to call out roll and brought the class back order.  
然而，老师开始点名，将课堂秩序恢复了。

Asuka meanwhile was thinking about what had just happened. When she had walked into the class every single guy was drooling over her, though that one behind her hadn't even flinched when she walked in. Either he was gay, retarded, or had no emotions of which she thought the last one was mostly true. She had attempted to get a reaction out of him by flirting with him a little, just to tease him, but he didn't even respond. 'How pathetic,' she thought. She couldn't stand weak guys.  
与此同时，明日香正在思考刚刚发生的事情。当她走进教室时，每个男生都对她垂涎三尺，唯独她身后的那个家伙在她进来时连眼皮都没动一下。要么他是同性恋，要么是智力障碍，要么就是毫无情感，她认为最后一种可能性最大。她试图通过稍微调情来激起他的反应，只是为了逗逗他，但他甚至没有任何回应。'真是可悲，'她想。她无法忍受软弱的男人。

Meanwhile the teacher had continued to call out names and Asuka answered when she heard hers called. When the teacher asked if Ayanami Rei was still absent Asuka smirked, 'So the precious First Child goes to this school as well. What a fun experience that will be, trying to have a conversation with the doll. She's even more lifeless than the guy behind me.'  
与此同时，老师继续点名，听到自己的名字时，明日香应了一声。当老师询问绫波零是否仍缺席时，明日香轻蔑一笑，'原来那个珍贵的第一适格者也在这所学校啊。跟那个娃娃交流一定很有趣，她比坐在我后面的家伙还要死气沉沉。'

The teacher went through the list of names and Shinji was starting to wonder if his name was even still on their when the teacher called out his name rather reluctantly.  
老师逐一念出名单上的名字，真嗣开始怀疑自己的名字是否还在上面，这时老师颇为勉强地叫出了他的名字。

"And Shinji Ikari. You're still here aren't you?" It was as if the teacher wished he wasn't.  
“还有碇真嗣，你还在这里吧？”仿佛老师希望他不在似的。

"Yeah," replied Shinji. 'Though I sure as hell don't want to be,' he thought.  
“嗯，”真嗣回答道。'虽然我绝对不想这样，'他心想。

Asuka however had spun around in her chair when she heard Shinji's last name, and frowned at him.  
然而，听到真嗣的姓氏后，明日香在椅子上转过身来，皱着眉头看向他。

Shinji noticed this but continued to stare out the window. 'God what is wrong with her? As far as I know she has no reason to hate me at all. Or is she just normally annoyed at everyone?'  
真嗣注意到了这一点，但继续凝视着窗外。'上帝啊，她怎么了？据我所知，她没有任何理由恨我。还是她对每个人都这样烦躁？'

Asuka had heard that Shinji's last name was Ikari but was still surprised to hear it. 'So your the son of Gendo Ikari who's in charge of Nerv, huh. I guess going to this school wasn't a complete waste of my time.'  
明日香曾听说真嗣的姓氏是碇，但亲耳听到还是感到惊讶。'原来你是那个负责 NERV 的碇源堂的儿子啊。看来来这所学校也不完全是浪费我的时间。'

Turning around, Asuka faced the front of the room, ignoring Shinji for the rest of the class period.  
明日香转过身，面向教室前方，整个课间再也没有理会真嗣。

Shinji however couldn't help but have his eyes stray towards her occasionally. She was really quite beautiful, even if her attitude was a little rough. Shinji was really starting to wish that he had just asked her name yesterday. If he had, maybe things wouldn't have gotten off to such a rough start.  
然而，真嗣忍不住时不时将目光投向她。她真的很美，尽管态度有些粗鲁。真嗣开始后悔昨天没有问她的名字。如果当时问了，也许事情就不会一开始就那么糟糕。

---

After school Shinji slowly walked back towards Misato's apartment. He figured that she would be wanting to hear about what he did in school today. 'She can be a bit annoying at times,' he thought. But then she was the best roommate that he had, so he wasn't complaining.  
放学后，真嗣缓缓走向美里小姐的公寓。他猜想她会想听听他今天在学校做了些什么。'她有时确实有点烦人，'他想。但她是他最好的室友，所以他并不抱怨。

As Shinji walked he couldn't help but notice that Asuka was walking on the sidewalk opposite of where he was. It seemed that the two of them where heading in the same direction and Shinji felt slightly nervous, remembering that their paths would cross at the next intersection.  
真嗣走着走着，忍不住注意到明日香在他对面的便道上走着。看起来他们俩正朝着同一个方向前进，真嗣感到有些紧张，记得他们的路线会在下一个路口交汇。

As she crossed the sidewalk to get on his side, he hurriedly sped up so that he could be in front of her. He was nervous now about talking to her, considering she seemed to dislike him. Shinji really didn't want to talk with her right now, and constantly looked over his shoulder to check that she was still a good distance away. Call him a coward if you will, but the last thing he wanted was to get on this girls bad side. Surprisingly though, he heard her calling out to him.  
当她穿过便道来到他这边时，他急忙加快脚步，以便能走在她前面。他现在对和她说话感到紧张，考虑到她似乎不喜欢他。真嗣真的不想现在和她说话，并不时回头确认她还在一段距离之外。如果你愿意，可以称他为懦夫，但他最不想的就是惹恼这个女孩。然而，出乎意料的是，他听到她在叫他。

"Oi, you, from this morning. Slow down a minute, I want to talk to you."  
“喂，你，今早的那个。慢点儿，我有话跟你说。”

Shinji did his best to ignore her, and kept walking forward, but his pace quickened slightly. He heard hurried footsteps behind him however, and soon, Asuka was matching her pace with his, several feet behind him. Ignoring her he continued to walk at a steady pace.  
真嗣尽力忽视她，继续向前走，但脚步稍稍加快了些。然而，他听到身后急促的脚步声，不久，明日香便与他保持了几步之遥，步伐一致。他继续稳稳地走着，对她视而不见。

'My god,' she thought in German. 'What does it take to get a reaction from this idiot?'  
“我的天，”她用德语想，“要怎样才能让这个白痴有点反应？”

She continued walking directly behind him, but changed pace again, so that she was walking at the same pace next to him. Shinji couldn't help it, and glanced over at her. Asuka was looking over at him. Her lips were smiling, but there was something malicious in her eyes that Shinji didn't care for.  
她继续直接跟在他身后走着，但又改变了步伐，以便与他并肩而行。真嗣忍不住瞥了她一眼。明日香正看着他。她的嘴角带着笑意，但眼中却闪烁着真嗣不喜欢的恶意。

'Does she expect me to say something? Or should I be acting like all the other guys in my classroom did?'  
'她是不是期待我说些什么？还是我应该像班上其他男生那样表现？'

Asuka didn't try say anything to him though, and after walking alongside him for a while in silence, Shinji heard her mumble something inaudible under her breath, and then she sped up past him, throwing him a rather vicious glance as she did.  
然而，明日香并没有试图对他说什么，在沉默中与他并肩走了一会儿后，真嗣听到她低声咕哝了一句听不清的话，然后她加快脚步超过了他，经过时还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。

Shinji slowed down, and then stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, looking up at the sky. 'Wonderful,' he thought. 'I get a cool roommate who acts like my guardian, but now I've met the strangest girl ever. Great way to start my new life out.'  
真嗣放慢了脚步，然后在人行道中央停了下来，抬头望向天空。'真是奇妙，'他心想，'我有了一个酷似监护人的室友，但现在又遇到了有史以来最奇怪的女孩。开启新生活的绝佳方式啊。'

Sighing slightly, he returned his eyes to the sidewalk, and continued walking. He was rather eager to get back to Misato's apartment, his new home, but he wished that Asuka would just go back to Germany.  
他轻轻叹了口气，将目光转回人行道上，继续前行。他相当渴望回到美里小姐的公寓，他的新家，但他希望明日香能直接回德国去。

---

"Misato I'm back," Shinji called as he took off his shoes and stepped into the apartment.  
“美里小姐，我回来了，”真嗣一边喊着，一边脱下鞋子走进了公寓。

"Ah good I was just getting worried. You took longer than I expected."  
"啊，太好了，我正担心呢。你比我想象中花的时间要长。"

"Well, some things happened," said Shinji as he walked into the kitchen and stopped dead when he saw that Misato was drinking tea with someone.  
"嗯，发生了一些事情，" 真嗣说着走进厨房，却在看到美里正和某人喝茶时愣住了。

Asuka was sitting at the kitchen table with Misato holding a tea cup in her hand which immediately fell to the floor, shattering, sending tea in all directions.  
明日香坐在厨房的桌子旁，手里拿着茶杯，茶杯立刻掉到地上，碎裂开来，茶水四溅。

Shinji blinked blankly back and suddenly realized what she was wearing. She was dressed in a loose tang-top which fell loosely around her chest revealing a little more then Shinji cared to comment on. She had apparently abandoned the need to even bother with pants and was in nothing more than her underwear, which were also white. What's more she had removed the hair clips and now her hair was meshed together in one long wave.  
真嗣茫然地眨了眨眼，随即突然意识到她穿的是什么。她身着一件宽松的唐装上衣，松松垮垮地垂在胸前，露出了比真嗣愿意评论的还要多的部分。她显然已经放弃了穿裤子的念头，只穿着内衣，同样也是白色的。更甚的是，她摘掉了发夹，现在她的头发如同一道长长的波浪般披散着。

Asuka stared blankly back at him for several seconds before shouting, "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?"  
明日香茫然地盯着他看了几秒钟，然后大喊道：“这他妈是什么鬼？”

She ran at him and grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him ferociously. Thankfully Misato stepped in between them before she was able to cause him any more bodily harm.  
她向他冲去，抓住他的肩膀猛烈摇晃。幸好美里及时介入，阻止了她进一步对他造成身体伤害。

"Asuka calm down," said Misato as she dragged her away from Shinji.  
“Asuka，冷静点，”Misato 边说边把她从 Shinji 身边拉开。

"Why is he here!?" “他为什么在这里！？”

Misato simply laughed. "I see that the two of you know each other from somewhere."  
Misato 只是笑了笑。“看来你们俩之前在哪儿见过面。”

Shinji now spoke up and said, "Unfortunately yes."  
真嗣这时开口说道：“不幸的是，确实如此。”

"What was?" yelled Asuka.  
“什么确实如此？”明日香大声问道。

"Now come on you two," said Misato. "You guys are both going to be living here, so I expect you to be able to get along."  
“好啦，你们两个，”美里说，“你们俩以后都要住在这里，所以我希望你们能和睦相处。”

They both stared blankly back at her.  
他们俩都茫然地回望着她。

"Come again?" asked Asuka. "I don't think I heard you correctly?"  
"再说一遍？" 明日香问道，"我觉得我没听清楚？"

"You. Two. Will. Be. Living. Together. Here," repeated Misato.  
"你们两个。将要。一起。住在这里，" 美里重复道。

Asuka looked blankly back at her and then turned around and walked out of the kitchen.  
明日香茫然地回头看了她一眼，然后转身走出了厨房。

"Asuka where are you going?" asked Misato as Asuka gathered up her things.  
“明日香，你要去哪儿？”美里问道，而明日香正在收拾自己的东西。

"I'm leaving. No way in hell can I live in the same apartment with this moron."  
“我要走了。我绝不可能和这个白痴住在同一个公寓里。”

With that she slammed the door and left the apartment.  
说完，她砰地一声关上门，离开了公寓。

Shinji was left standing alone in the kitchen as the whole thing hit him. 'Oh God. Me and Asuka living together? I wouldn't survive a day.' However when Misato came back in, she told him that Asuka had left without any intention of coming back.  
真嗣独自站在厨房里，这一切突然击中了他。'哦，天哪。我和明日香住在一起？我一天都撑不过去。'然而，当美里回来时，她告诉他明日香已经离开，没有回来的打算。

"What the hell happened between the two of you?" asked Misato.  
“你们俩之间到底发生了什么？”美里问道。

"...I'm not even sure," was all Shinji said, before he launched into the school day and what happened afterwards.  
“……我也不确定，”真嗣只说了这么一句，便开始讲述起学校里发生的事以及之后的经过。

---

By the time he had finished several hours had gone by and she could hear the steady plop plop as it started to rain outside.  
当他讲完时，几个小时已经过去了，她能听到外面开始下雨，传来一阵阵稳定的滴答声。

Misato looked out the window. She was starting to get worried about Asuka. She had left in nothing but that tang-top and underwear and was worried that she would be getting cold by now.  
美里望向窗外。她开始担心明日香了。明日香只穿着那件吊带衫和内衣就出去了，她担心她现在可能已经感到冷了。

Walking into the living room she saw that Shinji was contently sitting on the couch listening to his SDAT and reading a book. 'Does he really not care about here? Its not like she's the most unattractive girl out there.' Then she suddenly winced at the prospect of someone taking advantage of her with it raining like this.  
走进客厅，她看到真嗣正惬意地坐在沙发上，听着他的 SDAT，读着一本书。'他真的不在乎这里吗？她又不像是最不吸引人的女孩。'随后她突然因想到在这样的雨天有人可能会利用她而皱起了眉头。

"Shinji get up," she said pushing against his arm rather forcibly.  
“真嗣，起来，”她相当用力地推了推他的手臂说道。

"Huh...Oh Misato, what do you want?"  
“嗯...哦，美里，你想要什么？”

"What I want is for you to go out and find Asuka."  
"我想要的是你去找到明日香。"

Shinji frowned, "Why? You heard her, she doesn't want to be in the same room with me."  
真嗣皱眉，"为什么？你听到了，她不想和我待在同一个房间里。"

"So are you saying you aren't worried about her at all?"  
"那么你是说你一点都不担心她吗？"

"I..." he hesitated. "She can taking of herself," he said finally.  
"我..." 他犹豫了一下。"她能照顾好自己，" 他最终说道。

"Look its raining out and she's left in clothes that aren't even suitable for the summer."  
"看，外面在下雨，她却穿着连夏天都不合适的衣服。"

"Thats her problem not mine."  
"那是她的问题，不是我的。"

This earned him a slap. Putting his hand up to his face, he felt the spot that stung slightly from where Misato's hand had struck him. Looking up, he saw that she was glaring at him with something close to hatred.  
这让他挨了一巴掌。他抬起手摸向脸颊，感觉到被美里手掌击中的地方微微刺痛。抬头一看，只见她正用近乎憎恨的目光瞪着他。

"Are you that insensitive, Shinji? Do you seriously not care what could happen to her? She's out there in the freezing rain, possibly being picked up by some guy in a truck with who knows what happening to her. And you say that it's her problem not yours. She's right you don't have emotions. You're a coward."  
“你就这么迟钝吗，真嗣？你真的不在乎她可能遭遇什么吗？她在外面冰冷的雨中，可能被某个开着卡车的家伙带走，谁知道会发生什么。而你却说那是她的问题，不是你的。她说的没错，你没有感情。你是个懦夫。”

He looked back at her and suddenly felt ashamed of himself for thinking like that. She was right he was emotionless and a coward.  
他回望向她，突然为自己那样想感到羞愧。她说得对，他是个没有感情的懦夫。

Sitting bolt upright now he flung himself off the couch and ran to his room tossing on a pair of jeans a long sleeve shirt and a jacket. He was about to leave the room when he decided that he better bring a spare for Asuka.  
他猛地坐直身子，从沙发上跳下来，冲进自己的房间，迅速套上一条牛仔裤、一件长袖衬衫和一件夹克。正要离开房间时，他决定最好给明日香带件备用的。

He ran out of his room and found himself face to face with Misato.  
他跑出房间，迎面撞上了美里。

"I...I-I'm sorry for being such an insensitive jerk. I'll be sure to find her and bring her back."  
“我……我……我很抱歉，我真是个不体贴的混蛋。我一定会找到她，把她带回来。”

With that he ran out the door into the downpour.  
说完，他便冲出门外，投身于倾盆大雨之中。

Misato smiled slightly at him now, "Hmph he just doesn't want to let on to his emotions."  
美里此刻对他微微一笑，"哼，他就是不想表露自己的情感。"

---

Shinji ran through Tokyo-3, thinking of all the possibilities where Asuka could have gone. It had been at least three hours since she left and forty-five minutes since this downpour had started. 'She must have found shelter somewhere,' he thought and decided to check around some of the slums that littered Tokyo-3. Though he hoped that she had stayed out of those. Even though he had only known her for a short while, and he couldn't say he liked her, he was feeling worried for her sake.  
真嗣在第三新东京市中奔跑，脑海里不断闪现着明日香可能去的地方。她离开至少已有三个小时，而这场大雨也已持续了四十五分钟。'她一定在某处找到了避雨的地方，'他想，并决定去检查一下遍布第三新东京市的贫民窟。尽管他希望她没有涉足那些地方。虽然他认识她不久，也谈不上喜欢她，但他还是为她感到担忧。

Soon Shinji found himself going door to door to peoples houses asking if they had seen a girl around age fifteen or sixteen with long red hair and blue eyes. He didn't feel like mentioning what she was wearing. None of them where able to provide any answer and Shinji eventually decided that she wasn't in this part of Tokyo-3.  
不久，真嗣发现自己挨家挨户地敲门，询问是否有人见过一个大约十五六岁、长着红色长发和蓝色眼睛的女孩。他觉得没必要提及她的穿着。没有人能提供任何线索，真嗣最终断定她不在这片东京-3 的区域。

His mind was starting to scream out at him for letting things escalate to this point. 'AH IF ONLY I HAD JUST ASKED HER NAME YESTERDAY THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED.' Suddenly he remembered the beach yesterday.  
他的内心开始尖叫，责怪自己让事情发展到这个地步。'啊，如果昨天我直接问她的名字，也许就不会发生这种事了。'突然，他想起了昨天的海滩。

'Yes,' he told himself. 'Thats got to be where she is.'  
'没错，'他对自己说，'她一定在那里。'

Running faster than he could remember, with the spare jacket flopping along his shoulders, he managed to get to the beach within the span of minutes. Looking down he couldn't see much, owing to the fact that a mist had settled on the beach. He quickly ran down the steps leading to the beach, and started calling out her name frantically.  
他跑得比记忆中任何时候都快，备用夹克在肩上拍打着，几分钟内就赶到了海滩。低头一看，由于雾气笼罩，几乎看不清什么。他迅速跑下通往海滩的台阶，开始疯狂地呼喊她的名字。

'Damn it, she better be here,' he thought.  
“该死，她最好在这里，”他心想。

This mist was so hard to see, that several times had tripped over wooden logs that had been washed up onto the beach. Suddenly, he tripped over something that was rather large and heavy. Falling to the ground he reached over and felt that it was a bag of some sort. 'Asuka's bag?'  
这雾气如此浓重，以至于好几次他都被冲上沙滩的木头绊倒。突然，他被一个又大又重的东西绊倒了。摔倒在地，他伸手一摸，发现那是一个包。“明日香的包？”

Suddenly he yelled out, "Asuka where are you!?"  
突然，他大喊道：“明日香，你在哪儿！？”

At first, all he could hear was his own voice returning to him on the wind, but then he thought he heard a reply from somewhere off to his right. Scooping up her bag, he ran in the direction of the voice only to trip over something much more squishy and heard a small yelp of surprise. He realized that he had fallen on top of her but didn't care about the position when he heard her voice.  
起初，他只能听到自己的声音随风回荡，但随后他似乎听到右边某个地方传来了回应。他抓起她的包，朝着声音的方向跑去，却不料绊倒在一个软绵绵的东西上，听到了一声小小的惊呼。他意识到自己压在了她身上，但听到她的声音时，他并不在乎这个姿势。

"Idiot, what are you doing out here in the freezing cold."  
“笨蛋，这么冷的天你在外面干什么。”

The mist cleared and he saw that he was a few inches away from her face.  
雾气散去，他发现自己离她的脸只有几英寸远。

"...Asuka," he said weakly.  
"...明日香," 他虚弱地说道。

She frowned up at him, and sighed. "How long do you plan on lying on top of me."  
她皱着眉头看向他，叹了口气。"你打算在我身上躺多久？"

"Ah, no...this is," muttered Shinji.  
“啊，不……这是，”真嗣喃喃道。

He pushed himself off of her, and saw that she had gotten up also. His face opened up into his first blush as he saw that the rain had made her tang-top see through. It clung to her body like a fly clung to fly paper and Shinji had to tear his gaze away from her.  
他推开她，发现她也站了起来。看到雨水让她的短上衣变得透明，紧贴在身上如同苍蝇粘在苍蝇纸上，真嗣的脸颊泛起了第一抹红晕，不得不移开视线。

"So what do you want?" she asked with a scowl.  
“那你想要什么？”她皱着眉问道。

Shinji looked back at her rather surprised. "Why do you think I'm out here in the freezing rain? It certainly isn't to go for a jog."  
真嗣回头看着她，显得有些惊讶。“你觉得我为什么会在这种冰冷的雨中？当然不是为了去跑步。”

"Real witty," she smirked.  
“真机智，”她微微一笑。

"I was worried about you."  
“我担心你。”

Asuka had to let that flow through her mind before it registered.  
明日香不得不让这些思绪在脑海中流淌，然后才逐渐理解。

"You where worried about me?" she whispered.  
“你担心我？”她低声问道。

"Of course. You just left without a word. Then this storm started up, and you...well weren't wearing much so...and also I well...I mean...your not the most err unattractive girl so...I was a bit well...worried about your well being. What with how you looked and...some guys might have wanted to take advantage of that."  
“当然。你一声不吭就走了。然后这场风暴开始了，而你……嗯，穿得不多，所以……而且我也……我的意思是……你不是那种……呃，不吸引人的女孩，所以……我有点……担心你的安危。考虑到你的样子和……有些家伙可能会想占你便宜。”

Asuka was amazed at what he was referring to.  
明日香对他所指的事情感到惊讶。

"You were scared that I might have been raped?" she whispered.  
“你担心我可能被强奸了？”她低声问道。

"Yeah," he mumbled. “嗯，”他含糊地应道。

She was touched by his chivalrousness but didn't want to admit it.  
她被他的骑士精神所感动，但不想承认这一点。

"Idiot, I can take care of myself." Frowning at him, she continued with, "Thanks though, I guess...or...well...yeah"  
"傻瓜，我自己能照顾好自己。" 她皱着眉头对他说，接着又补充道，"不过，还是谢谢了，我想...或者...嗯...好吧"

It was a little awkward for the two of them. Barely three hours ago they had been looking daggers at each other. Shinji took this moment to hand her her bag and also give her the spare coat.  
对他们两人来说，这有点尴尬。仅仅三个小时前，他们还彼此怒目而视。真嗣趁这个机会递给她她的包，还把备用外套给了她。

She looked at him, surprised at the thoughtfulness of this and took it without question. Though when she put it on she started shivering worse than ever.  
她惊讶于他的体贴，毫不犹豫地接过那件衣物。然而，当她穿上后，却开始比之前颤抖得更厉害。

"Is something wrong," he asked?  
“有什么不对劲吗？”他问道。

"Of course idiot, this thing is soaking wet. I felt better without it."  
“当然，傻瓜，这东西湿透了。不穿还好些。”

"Well, then take mine. It's warmer."  
"那好吧，用我的。我的更暖和。"

"With your body touching it, not a chance."  
"你那身体贴着它，别想了。"

"Oh just deal with it Asuka. Your freezing cold."  
"哎，别抱怨了，明日香。你冷得要命。"

"Fine," she snapped at him.  
"好吧，"她厉声对他说。

They both looked at the ground for a while before Shinji said, "Come on lets go back. Misato's worried sick about you."  
他们俩都盯着地面好一会儿，然后真嗣说："走吧，我们回去。美里担心得要命。"

"No, I still don't want to live in the same house as you."  
"不，我还是不想和你住在同一个屋檐下。"

"What, you have another place to go, or where you planning to sleep outside?"  
"怎么，你有别的地方可去，还是打算露宿街头？"

Asuka flushed angrily at what he said about her not having a place to sleep. "Anythings better than having to share an apartment with you, idiot."  
听到他说她无处可睡，明日香气得脸红。"总比和你这个白痴共住一个公寓强。"

"Fine then," sighed Shinji. "Have fun spending the night under a cardboard box."  
"好吧，"真嗣叹了口气。"祝你睡纸箱愉快。"

He turned to leave but felt her grab onto his wrist. He smiled slightly, 'Hmph figures.'  
他转身欲走，却感觉她抓住了他的手腕。他微微一笑，'哼，意料之中。'

She spun him around with surprising force and gave him something reminiscent of a smile. "Fine, you win, idiot. I'll stay at Misato's place until I find a proper place to stay. However," and here her tone turned deathly cold. "If I ever catch you sneaking into my room in the middle of the night, or peeking at me in the shower, I'll be sure to kick you so hard in the balls you'll have to have them surgically removed out of your ass."  
她以惊人的力量将他转过身来，给了他一个类似微笑的表情。"好吧，你赢了，傻瓜。我会暂时住在美里那里，直到找到合适的地方。不过，"说到这里，她的语气变得极其冰冷。"如果我再发现你半夜溜进我房间，或者偷看我洗澡，我一定会狠狠踢你的蛋蛋，让你不得不从屁股里做手术取出来。"

She walked past him, but not before giving him a light jab on his shoulder. 'What did I just do,' asked Shinji to himself? 'I actually convinced her to stay. I must be loosing my mind. I won't last till sunrise.'  
她从他身边走过，临走前轻轻戳了一下他的肩膀。'我刚才做了什么？' 真嗣自问。'我居然说服她留下来了。我一定是疯了。我撑不到天亮了。'

---

Asuka arrived back at Misato's apartment a little ahead of Shinji. Shinji hadn't wanted to give her an excuse to start physically abusing him again and walked several paces behind her.  
明日香比真嗣早一步回到了美里小姐的公寓。真嗣不想给她再次动手打自己的借口，于是故意落后她几步。

When Asuka walked back into Misato's apartment Misato threw her arms around Asuka and gave her a big hug. Shinji arrived back in time to see this and had to suppress a grin. 'Maybe it wont be so bad. Having her stay here.'  
当明日香走进美里小姐的公寓时，美里张开双臂给了她一个大大的拥抱。真嗣刚好赶到，看到这一幕，忍不住想笑。'也许她住在这里不会太糟糕。'

Misato let go of Asuka and now walked over to Shinji and gave him the same big hug. Shinji felt that his back was about ready to split in two. He looked over Misato's shoulder and saw that Asuka was laughing at him silently. The difference it brought to her features was astounding. Where before their had been moody, angry German girl, their now stood someone who seemed rather friendly, Shinji smirked at her slightly. Seeing this Asuka stopped laughing and gave him a scowl before she walked past them, to her room and slammed the sliding door to a close only to have it bounce back open.  
美里放开明日香，走向真嗣，同样给了他一个大大的拥抱。真嗣感觉自己的背快要被压断了。他透过美里的肩膀看到明日香在无声地嘲笑他。她的表情变化令人惊叹。之前还是个阴沉、愤怒的德国女孩，现在却显得相当友好。真嗣微微对她笑了笑。看到这一幕，明日香停止了笑声，瞪了他一眼，然后走过他们，回到自己的房间，用力拉上推拉门，结果门又弹了回来，敞开着。

"DAMN JAPANESE DOORS! CAN'T I EVEN GET SOME PRIVACY!? I'M GONNA NEED TO GET A LOCK ON THIS THING TO KEEP THAT IDIOT OUT!"  
"该死的日本门！我连一点隐私都得不到吗？！我得在这东西上装个锁，把那个白痴挡在外面！"

Shinji just laughed at her outburst and walked to his own room feeling suddenly tired. Flopping down on his own futon he couldn't help but feel slightly happy that he would be living together with Asuka. Rolling over onto his side he turned of his SDAT and fell asleep.  
真嗣只是对她的大喊大笑，然后走向自己的房间，突然感到疲惫。他扑倒在榻榻米上，忍不住感到一丝高兴，因为他将与明日香同住。翻身侧躺，他关掉了 SDAT，沉沉睡去。

### Chapter 2: The Chosen Child  
第二章：被选中的孩子  

**Posting Chapter 2 along with chapter 1. Its just how I do things. Get a nice long stream of chapters and post them together. Well I've also got another story going at the same time and that one currently takes precedence over this one. So don't expect to see this update as much as I (or you) would like it.  
与第一章一起发布第二章。我就是这么做事的。先写好一长串章节，然后一起发布。另外，我还有另一部作品同时在进行，目前那部作品优先级更高。所以别指望这部作品会像我（或你）希望的那样频繁更新。**

---

Touji and Kensuke were sitting at their desks waiting for class to start, and talking about none other than Asuka.  
当真和健介坐在他们的课桌旁，等待上课开始，谈论的正是明日香。

"I can't believe that we get a girl as hot as she is, and to think she's foreign. Just thinking about her gets me rigid," said Touji.  
"真不敢相信我们能遇到像她这么火辣的女孩，而且还是个外国人。光是想到她，我就硬了，" 东治说道。

Kensuke just nodded his consent aware that the same thing happened every time she walked by him. "I brought my best camera today just incase in case I was able to get a view up her skirt."  
真嗣只是点头表示同意，他知道每次她从他身边走过时，同样的事情都会发生。"我今天带了我最好的相机，以防万一我能拍到她的裙底风光。"

Touji turned to his friend, grabbed him by the shoulders and said, "If you do be sure to give a copy to me. That's gonna be some of the best jerk off material that we can get our hands on."  
东治转向他的朋友，抓住他的肩膀说："如果你拍到了，一定要给我一份。那将成为我们能弄到的最棒的打飞机素材。"

"What kind of underwear do you think she wears," asked Kensuke.  
“你觉得她会穿什么样的内衣？” 真嗣问道。

"With luck a silky red thong with matching bra if were lucky," replied Touji as he was fantasizing about it.  
“希望是红色丝质丁字裤配同款胸罩，如果运气好的话，” 东治一边回答一边幻想着。

Just then the two of them were brought out of their discussion by loud voices coming from the hall way.  
就在这时，走廊传来的嘈杂声打断了他们的讨论。

"What the fuck do mean you let Misato make our lunches for us today. You know how bad of a cook she is right?"  
“你他妈什么意思，让美里今天给我们做午饭？你知道她厨艺有多糟糕吧？”

Touji and Kensuke heard a loud audible sigh, then a response, "Hai Asuka, but I was to tired from last night to bother making anything," came Shinji's voice  
听到一声明显的叹息后，传来真嗣的声音：“嗨，明日香，但我昨晚太累了，懒得做任何东西。”

Kensuke and Touji's eyes widened in fear. 'Since when were Asuka and Shinji on a first name basis. 'And what the fuck did Shinji mean when he was to tired from last night. Surely they didn't have sex.'  
"健介和透治的眼睛因恐惧而睁大。‘明日香和真嗣什么时候开始直呼其名了？’‘还有真嗣说的昨晚太累是什么意思？他们该不会是……’”

The classroom door was then thrown open and in stepped the familiar German red head who every male had recently had thoughts about in their showers at home.  
教室的门突然被猛地推开，随即走进来的是那位熟悉的德国红发女孩，最近每个男生在家洗澡时都会想起她。

"Shinji no baka, how the fuck do expect me to eat the shit called food that Misato makes."  
“真嗣你个笨蛋，你他妈怎么指望我吃美里做的那堆狗屎一样的食物。”

"Then just eat the school food," said Shinji starting to get annoyed.  
“那就吃学校的食物吧，”真嗣开始感到不耐烦地说。

Asuka wheeled around and grabbed him by the shirt before yelling at him, "That shits almost as worse as Misato's cooking. I'd rather starve then eat it."  
明日香猛地转身，一把抓住他的衬衫，冲他吼道：“那玩意儿简直和美里做的饭一样糟糕。我宁愿饿死也不吃。”

"THEN STARVE," yelled Shinji back at her finally losing his patience.  
“那就饿死吧！”真嗣朝她吼回去，终于失去了耐心。

Asuka was surprised at his outburst. She always got what she wanted and she wasn't about to let him make a fool of herself in class. Drawing back her hand she intended to slap him with everything she had but he caught her hand as it was brought up to his face. She was now frozen in silent disbelief. 'This weak ass coward has the nerve to touch me. Well, he won't be standing much longer.' Now she brought up her knee and intended to knee him in the balls but she was frozen when she heard his comment.  
明日香对他的爆发感到惊讶。她总是能得到她想要的，绝不允许他在班上让自己出丑。她收回手，打算用尽全力扇他一巴掌，但他的手在她抬手到脸前时抓住了她。她现在僵住了，无声地难以置信。“这个懦弱的胆小鬼居然敢碰我。哼，他站不了多久了。”她抬起膝盖，打算用膝盖顶他的下体，但听到他的话时她僵住了。

"Incase you haven't realized Asuka their is only a certain amount of shit that I can take before I get pissed off and let it all out. So if you ever want to see the angry side of me continue to do what your doing. I've got enough hate built up over the span of my life, and wouldn't mind sending it all in your direction."  
“如果你还没意识到的话，我告诉你，明日香，我忍耐的极限是有限的，一旦超过我就会爆发。所以如果你想见识我生气的样子，就继续做你现在做的事。我这一生积累了足够的恨意，不介意全部发泄在你身上。”

Shinji let go of her hand and walked over to his desk, only realizing now that their fight was witnessed by the whole class. 'Maybe they'll think twice before talking behind my back.'  
真嗣松开了她的手，走到自己的桌前，这时才意识到他们的争吵被全班同学看到了。“也许他们以后在背后议论我之前会三思。”

Every male in the class was now looking at Shinji with absolute loathing. "Where the hell does he get off yelling at Asuka like that," said somebody whispering to their friend.  
班上所有的男生现在都用绝对厌恶的眼神看着真嗣。“他到底凭什么那样对明日香大吼大叫，”有人低声对朋友说。

"It looks like Asuka is in shock over what happened."  
"看起来明日香对刚才发生的事感到震惊。"

"Well, can't blame her, she's a new student and she now knows how much of an ass Shinji is."  
"嗯，也不能怪她，她是个新生，现在知道了真嗣有多混蛋。"

Asuka stood their for several minutes still looking straight ahead. This was the first time that she had ever been yelled at like that before, not even her step mother who she loathed. Getting control of herself she walked over to her desk, ignoring the fact that Shinji was behind her, and sat down.  
明日香站在那里好几分钟，依旧直视前方。这是她第一次被人那样吼，就连她讨厌的继母也没有过。她控制住自己，走到桌前，无视身后的真嗣，坐了下来。

Most of the class continued to stare at the two of them, though they were both staring off into space completely unaware of the stares they were getting.  
班上大部分同学继续盯着他们俩，尽管他们俩都茫然地望着远方，完全没有意识到自己正被人盯着。

---

During lunch Shinji was starting to have regrets about blowing up in Asuka's face. But she really was so damn bitchy sometimes. He thought that after last night they could have gotten along fairly well but that morning wasn't very fun.  
午餐时，真嗣开始后悔对明日香发火。但她有时候真的太刻薄了。他原以为经过昨晚他们能相处得不错，但今早并不愉快。

Shinji had woken up to his alarm going off and saw that he had almost no time to get ready. He had taken a quick shower tossed on some clothes and ran into the kitchen only to find Asuka sitting their tapping her finger on the table.  
真嗣被闹钟吵醒，发现自己几乎没有时间准备。他匆匆洗了个澡，套上衣服，冲进厨房，却发现明日香坐在那里，用手指敲打着桌子。

She had given him a sour look and just said food. Shinji had raised his eyebrows at this point and had asked why she didn't make it herself. He remembered that this was the start of one of her bitchy moods again. She had said that since Misato was such a lousy cook then it was his job to cook for her every morning before school and every afternoon when they came home.  
她给了他一个酸溜溜的眼神，只说了句“食物”。此时，真嗣挑了挑眉，问她为什么不自己动手。他记得这标志着她又一次进入了那种刻薄的情绪。她声称，既然美里是个糟糕的厨师，那么每天早上上学前和下午回家后，为他准备饭菜就成了他的职责。

Shinji had refused at first but then after receiving a sharp blow to the face he gave in and cooked her something that he had never tried since she didn't seem to like Japanese food. All in all he thought that his first attempt at a German breakfast was rather decent. Even Asuka seemed to think the sauerkraut was good, though she didn't mention anything of it.  
起初，真嗣拒绝了，但在脸上挨了一记重击后，他妥协了，为她做了些自己从未尝试过的东西，因为她似乎不喜欢日本料理。总的来说，他认为自己第一次尝试做德国早餐还算不错。就连明日香似乎也觉得酸菜不错，尽管她对此只字未提。

Then though when they were just about to leave Asuka had demanded that he also make lunch for them. Shinji had simply pointed to two sack lunches that were obviously supposed to be for them. Asuka had said that Misato had made those and that their was no way that she was going to touch anything that Misato cooked. Shinji could understand her reasoning, he had already had a bad experience with Misato who didn't even seem to know how to cook rice.  
然而，就在他们即将离开时，明日香要求他也为他们准备午餐。真嗣只是指了指两个显然是为他们准备的便当。明日香说那是美里做的，她绝不会碰美里做的任何东西。真嗣能理解她的理由，他之前已经有过一次糟糕的经历，美里甚至连煮饭都不会。

Asuka however had thrown her sack lunch at Shinji's face spilling the contents all over his face and forcing him to take a shower. Which made her even more pissed at him for almost making them late.  
然而，明日香却将她的便当袋扔向了真嗣的脸，里面的东西洒了他一脸，逼得他不得不去洗澡。这让她更加恼火，因为他差点让他们迟到。

Now though as Shinji had his back against railing up on the school roof he was starting to wish that he had just done what she asked. In truth he wanted to be her friend but she just blew off his attempts to make conversation when yesterday she had practically tried to seduce him. Though if he had done anything he assumed she would have kicked him in the balls. Suddenly he heard the opening and closing of a door and looked around to see two of his class mates, Touji and Kensuke. Touji was standing their rather threatening cracking his knuckles while Kensuke was holding his camera up as though preparing to start taking pictures.  
现在，真嗣背靠在学校屋顶的栏杆上，开始后悔没有听她的话。实际上，他很想和她做朋友，但昨天她几乎试图引诱他，而今天却对他的搭话置之不理。尽管如此，如果他真的做了什么，他猜她会一脚踢向他的下体。突然，他听到了开门和关门的声音，转头一看，是他的两个同学，东治和健介。东治站在那里，威胁性地活动着手指，而健介则举着相机，似乎准备开始拍照。

Shinji raised an eyebrow up at them and asked, "What do you two want."  
真嗣对他们挑了挑眉，问道：“你们两个想要什么？”

Touji's response was a mean right hook to the side of Shinji's face.  
冬二回敬的是一记狠辣的右勾拳，直击真嗣的脸颊。

Shinji was caught unaware and went flying to the concrete landing hard and reopening his cut that he had received when Misato almost ran him over. Feeling a steady pain in his arm and something warm trickling down and dripping down on the ground he looked up only to be greeted by another punch of Touji's.  
真嗣毫无防备，被击飞到水泥地上，重重摔落，之前被美里差点撞到时留下的伤口再次裂开。他感到手臂持续疼痛，有温热的液体缓缓流下，滴落在地。抬头一看，迎接他的却是冬二的又一拳。

This next one dazed him slightly as he saw white spots in front of him. Wiping a trickle of blood that had appeared at the side of his mouth he heard Touji say, "You little shit. What the fuck where you harassing Asuka for this morning."  
这一拳让他有些晕眩，眼前出现了白点。他擦去嘴角渗出的一丝血迹，听到冬二说道：“你这个小混蛋，早上干嘛骚扰明日香？”

Shinji would have loved to retort that she had it coming but felt like his head was going to split open any moment. It didn't help that Kensuke had now started taking pictures and was making his vision fade and turn blurry. Shinji then felt a sharp jab to his stomach and felt all the wind knocked out of him including his lunch. Wiping his mouth again which now tasted like blood and bile he looked up again to see Touji looking down on him, disgust all over his face.  
真嗣本想反驳说她自找的，但感觉自己的头随时都要裂开似的。更糟糕的是，健介现在开始拍照，让他的视线变得模糊不清。接着，真嗣感到腹部一阵剧痛，仿佛所有的空气连同午餐都被击飞了。他再次擦了擦嘴，现在嘴里满是血和胆汁的味道。他抬头一看，只见东治俯视着他，满脸的厌恶。

Touji then picked him up by the collar of his shirt and gave him a final warning, "If I ever see you yelling at Asuka again I'll make sure that you lose more than just your lunch."  
东治随后揪住他的衣领将他提起，给了他最后的警告：“如果我再看到你对明日香大喊大叫，我保证你失去的不仅仅是午餐。”

Looking up slowly at the jocks face Shinji smirked with what remained of his consciences and said, "If you were living with the redheaded bitch then you wouldn't be so inclined to hitting me." Upon saying this Shinji felt a blow to the front of his face and felt his nose breaking spewing blood everywhere before he passed out.  
真嗣缓缓抬头看着东治的脸，用仅存的意识冷笑道：“如果你和那个红发婊子住在一起，你就不会这么想打我了。”话音刚落，真嗣感到脸上重重一击，鼻子断裂，鲜血四溅，随后便失去了意识。

---

The first thing Shinji realized when he was conscious again was that someone had woken him up with a light pound on the top of his head. The second thing he realized was that his whole head was on fire. Touching the side of his face he felt a sticky sensation and pulled his hand away to see crimson blood on his hand. Remembering what had happened he put his had up to his nose and felt that it had been bent into a weird angle. Wincing slightly at how it felt he now moved his tongue around in his mouth to see if any teeth had been knocked loose. Not finding any he spit on the ground expecting to see blood but only seeing white saliva.  
当真嗣再次恢复意识时，他首先意识到的是有人用轻轻一击唤醒了他。接着，他意识到整个头部如同着火一般剧痛。他触摸脸颊，感觉到一种粘稠的感觉，抽回手时，手上沾满了鲜红的血。回想起发生的事情，他将手伸向鼻子，感觉到鼻梁已经扭曲成了一个奇怪的角度。微微皱眉，感受着这种不适，他开始在嘴里转动舌头，检查是否有牙齿松动。没有发现松动的牙齿，他吐了一口在地上，期待看到血迹，却只看到了白色的唾液。

"Thats disgusting," a voice in front of him said. "By the way you look like shit."  
“真恶心，”一个声音在他面前说道，“顺便说一句，你看起来糟透了。”

Shinji looked up and was surprised to see Asuka standing over him with a frown on her face. A mixture of emotions surged through Shinji including, loathing, spite, self hatred, and for some reason longing. How the hell he could still like her even with this being partially her fault for him ending up in this mess, he didn't know. Though now that he looked at her face more closely he thought he saw something else hidden behind that frown of hers, worry. Even so Shinji didn't want to have her laughing in his face so he rudely said, "What do you want?"  
真嗣抬头一看，惊讶地发现明日香正皱着眉头站在他面前。一股复杂的情绪涌上心头，包括厌恶、怨恨、自我憎恨，还有不知为何的渴望。他不知道自己怎么还能喜欢她，尽管这一切在某种程度上也是她的错，让他陷入这种困境。不过，现在仔细看她的脸，他觉得在那皱眉背后还隐藏着别的情绪，是担忧。即便如此，真嗣不想让她嘲笑自己，于是粗鲁地问道：“你想干嘛？”

Asuka was surprised at this tone of voice and said, "Nothing really, I just decided to skip class and was wandering around when I saw you passed out up here. What happened anyway."  
明日香对这种语气感到惊讶，说道：“没什么，我只是决定逃课，四处闲逛时看到你在这里昏倒了。到底发生了什么？”

Now Shinji could definitely detect the worry in her voice. "Why do you care? I figured seeing me like this would make you happy."  
现在真嗣可以肯定她的声音里带着担忧。“你为什么关心？我以为看到我这样你会高兴。”

This brought a sour look to Asuka's, "Asshole, why would I be happy about something like this."  
这让明日香露出了厌恶的表情，“混蛋，我怎么可能为这种事高兴。”

'And yet you seem to enjoy hitting me every chance you get,' thought Shinji. Giving her a final look he sighed and said, "Touji, that big dumb jock felt like fucking up my face after our little argument this morning."  
“尽管如此，你似乎每次有机会都要打我一顿，”真嗣心想。他最后看了她一眼，叹了口气说，“东治，那个大块头傻瓜，今天早上我们吵了一架后，他就想把我的脸打烂。”

Asuka starred back at him in surprise, "You mean that baka did this to you just because you yelled at me."  
明日香惊讶地回望着他，“你是说那个笨蛋就因为你对我吼了一声就把你打成这样？”

"Surprised? Expected for him to kick the shit out of me even more, I assume."  
"惊讶吗？我猜你以为他会把我打得屁滚尿流吧。"

Asuka looked back at him annoyed, "Why the hell do you think I'm enjoying this. It sickens me really."  
明日香回头恼怒地看着他，"为什么你他妈会觉得我喜欢这个。这真的让我恶心。"

"Hmph," was all Shinji managed to say.  
"哼，" 真嗣只能说出这么一句。

Suddenly he felt something soft hit his face and looked up to see a white rag hanging over the side of his head. Looking over in Asuka's direction he saw that she was watching him expectingly.  
突然，他感到有什么柔软的东西打在了脸上，抬头一看，发现一块白布挂在了他的头侧。他朝明日香的方向看去，只见她正期待地看着他。

"Thats to clean yourself off with. Now get a move on. I feel like vomiting from all that blood."  
“那是用来擦干净自己的。现在快点行动。我因为那些血感到想吐。”

Shinji nodded his consent and proceeded to wipe as much of the blood off of his face as he could. His white shirt was ruined though, the blood had already stained it.  
真嗣点头同意，开始尽可能地擦掉脸上的血迹。不过他的白衬衫已经毁了，血迹已经渗了进去。

"Why are you being nice to me all the sudden anyway, Asuka?"  
“为什么你突然对我这么好，明日香？”

Asuka who had had her back turned to him now wheeled around and said, "Don't get any ideas. I just feel like this is a good way for me to repay you for what you did last night. Also...I...feel that some of this...is well, my fault."  
背对着他的明日香转过身来，说道：“别多想。我只是觉得这样能回报你昨晚做的事。而且……我……觉得有些事情……嗯，是我的错。”

Shinji thought that his brain had shut down momentarily and he had miss heard what she just said. "Asuka, well, umm thanks. But this is more my fault. I was the one that got angry and yelled at you. Also, while Touji was hitting me, I kind of said somethings not so nice about you. I regret saying those now, it was more of the heat of the moment and I was still angry with you."  
真嗣觉得自己的大脑可能暂时关闭了，他怀疑自己听错了她的话。“明日香，嗯，谢谢。但这更多是我的错。是我生气了，对你大喊大叫。而且，当东治打我的时候，我好像说了一些不太好听的话。我现在后悔说了那些，那只是当时情绪激动，我还在生你的气。”

"Baka Shinji..." "笨蛋真嗣..."

Shinji continued to wipe the blood of his face while Asuka leaned over the railing and watched down town Tokyo-3. Shinji was surprised however when she crouched down next to him and frowned at his face. "You missed a spot by the way, bottom left lip."  
真嗣继续擦拭着脸上的血迹，而明日香则倚在栏杆上，俯视着东京-3 的市区。然而，当她蹲在他身边，皱着眉头看他的脸时，真嗣感到惊讶。“顺便说一句，你漏了一块，左下唇。”

Shinji hastily whipped the corner of his mouth, "Gone now?"  
真嗣急忙擦了擦嘴角，“现在干净了吗？”

Asuka laughed which again seemed to change the way she looked. "Yeah, you look a lot better."  
明日香笑了，这笑容似乎又改变了她的模样。“是啊，你看起来好多了。”

Now they stood their hanging over the railing looking at downtown Tokyo-3.  
现在他们站在那里，俯瞰着东京-3 的市中心。

"Hey Asuka how come you decided to skip class. Surely it wasn't to look for me."  
“嘿，明日香，你怎么决定逃课了？肯定不是为了找我吧。”

"What you baka. Of course not. I've already learned everything you guys are covering. Don't forget I graduated from a university at the age of fourteen. I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for...certain reasons."  
"你这个笨蛋。当然不是。我已经学完了你们正在学的一切。别忘了我十四岁就大学毕业了。如果不是因为...某些原因，我根本不会在这里。"

Shinji would have liked to know what those certain reasons but knew better than to ask. Suddenly he was pulled away from his thoughts when he saw Asuka reaching into the pocket of her blouse to pull out her phone.  
真嗣很想知道那些特定原因是什么，但他知道最好不要问。突然，他的思绪被拉了回来，因为他看到明日香把手伸进她的衬衫口袋里拿手机。

"Hai, yes I'm at school...I'll tell you later...NO!...You want me to come in?...Another one...hai, hai, I'll head their right now...OK see you soon." With that she hung up the phone and turned to Shinji. "Sorry baka but I've got some things that I've got take care of so I got to go. Though I expect you to have dinner cooked for me when I get home."  
"嗨，是的，我在学校...我稍后告诉你...不！...你想让我进去吗？...又一个...嗨，嗨，我马上过去...好的，待会儿见。" 说完，她挂了电话，转向真嗣。"抱歉，笨蛋，但我有些事情要处理，所以我得走了。不过我希望我回家时你已经把晚饭做好了。"

"Err what time will that be."  
"呃，那会是什么时候？"

Asuka knew that it could be anytime from now till the next day but just said sometime after six, hopefully.  
明日香知道这可能从现在到明天任何时候，但还是说大概六点后，希望如此。

"OK I'll have it ready when you get back. And Misato should be back around the same time to."  
"好的，你回来时我会准备好的。还有美里应该也差不多同一时间回来。"

Asuka didn't want to let on how close he was, just nodded and said that she would see him later that night.  
明日香不想透露自己有多接近他，只是点点头说晚上会再见他。

---

'Hmm I wonder what Asuka will want for dinner. She hates everything we Japanese eat so...I could go online I suppose and find something that she might like. Then again I think I read somewhere about something called Jagerschnitzel...err what did it include again.'  
'嗯，不知道明日香晚餐想吃什么。她讨厌我们日本人吃的一切……或许我可以上网找些她可能喜欢的东西。不过，我记得在某处读到过一种叫炸肉排的东西……呃，它包含什么来着？'

Suddenly Shinji was brought out of his train of thought when an announcement boomed through all of Tokyo-3. "The JSSDF has announced that Tokyo-3 will be going into lock down. All citizens will please head to the nearest shelter. I repeat all citizens will you please head to the nearest shelter. That is all."  
突然，真嗣的思绪被东京-3 全境的广播打断。"东京-3 特别防卫队宣布，东京-3 将进入封锁状态。请所有市民前往最近的避难所。重复一遍，请所有市民前往最近的避难所。完毕。"

Shinji stood their in shock, "Wonderful, what the hell could have happened that is sending all of Tokyo-3 into disarray." Not wanting to wait for something to happen Shinji quickly followed the now flashing signs that had popped up on street corners showing him the direction of the shelters.  
真嗣站在那里震惊不已，心想：“太好了，到底发生了什么鬼事情，让整个第三新东京市陷入混乱。”不想坐等事态发展，真嗣迅速跟随那些突然出现在街角的闪烁指示牌，指示着他前往避难所的方向。

Half way to the nearest shelter he stopped and thought, 'Wait what about Asuka...she'll be okay right. She heard the alarm.'  
在前往最近避难所的半路上，他停下脚步思索，‘等等，那明日香怎么办...她应该没事吧。她听到了警报。’

Running a little faster now he sped up and was soon in front of the shelter when he stopped again. 'But wait what if she is somewhere where she can't get to a shelter. Ahh why the hell am I even worrying about her. Its not like she ever showed any emotion to me.' Not true said a small voice in the back of Shinji's head. 'She obviously was worried about your condition earlier.'  
现在他跑得更快了，不久就来到了避难所前，却又再次停下。‘但是，万一她在某个无法到达避难所的地方怎么办。啊，我他妈为什么要担心她。她对我从来没表现出任何情感。’但内心深处一个小小的声音反驳道，‘她显然之前对你的状况很担心。’

'No not possible for her. Worrying about someone else is beneath her.'  
'不，她不可能的。担心别人对她来说是掉价的事。'

'Suit yourself then coward. But remember when you see her corpse, remember that you could have done something to prevent that from happening.'  
'随你便吧，懦夫。但记住，当你看到她的尸体时，记住你本可以做些什么来阻止这一切发生的。'

"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY MIND," Shinji screamed out loud.  
“滚出我的脑海，”真嗣大声尖叫道。

"Hey kid stop screaming about random shit and get your ass in here."  
“嘿，小子，别再鬼叫那些乱七八糟的东西了，赶紧滚进来。”

Shinji looked up to see a middle aged man with his hand held out beckoning Shinji to get into shelter. "C'mon kid get in here or your gonna die."  
真嗣抬头一看，一个中年男子正伸出手招呼他进入避难所。“快点，小子，进来，不然你就要死了。”

Shinji almost put out his hand to grasp the middle aged man's hand when a small voice echoed in his mind, 'Coward.' It was the voice of Asuka and suddenly Shinji saw her as a corpse with the left side of her face torn away leaving one of her eyes dangling out of its socket. 'Where the hell where you Shinji. Cowering like the rest of them while I was trying to protect all your sorry asses. Your nothing but a coward.'  
真嗣几乎要伸出手去握住那位中年男子的手，这时一个微弱的声音在他脑海中响起：‘懦夫。’那是明日香的声音，突然间，真嗣眼前浮现出她尸体般的模样，左脸被撕裂，一只眼睛悬挂在眼眶外。‘你到底在哪里，真嗣？和其他人一样躲起来，而我却在试图保护你们这些可怜的家伙。你不过是个懦夫。’

'NO IT WASNT MY FAULT,' screamed Shinji in his head.  
'不，那不是我的错！' 真嗣在心里尖叫道。

'Yes it was, you abandoned me. I thought you cared about me. I thought something developed between us during that rainy night.'  
'是的，是你抛弃了我。我以为你关心我。我以为在那雨夜我们之间产生了某种情感。'

'HOW THE HELL, AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU IF ALL YOU EVER DO IS YELL AT ME AND PUNCH ME.'  
'我他妈怎么知道我对你的感觉是什么，如果你总是对我大喊大叫还打我！'

'Wise up Shinji and find out what I'm really meaning.' The slowly rotting Asuka in Shinji's mind now put her hand up and slowly stroked the side of Shinji's face. Only now did Shinji see that the ends of some of her fingers were missing and the bones was perturbing out. 'No Asuka don't, I wont let this happen to you.'  
“醒醒吧，真嗣，弄清楚我真正的意思。”在真嗣心中逐渐腐烂的明日香举起手，缓缓抚摸着真嗣的脸颊。直到此刻，真嗣才注意到她的一些手指末端已经缺失，骨头令人不安地露了出来。“不，明日香，不要这样，我不会让你变成这样的。”

'Then you better get your sorry ass up and find me.' With that the Asuka in Shinji's mind gave him a light slap to the face jerking Shinji back to the present.  
“那你最好赶紧振作起来找到我。”话音刚落，真嗣心中的明日香轻轻扇了他一巴掌，将真嗣拉回了现实。

Shinji blinked his eyes slightly and now looked at the person with his hand extended. His appearance had changed and now he looked like a demon beckoning Shinji to hell. "C'mon kid. It will be okay. You'll be safe with us."  
真嗣微微眨了眨眼，现在看着那个伸出手的人。他的外貌变了，现在看起来像是一个召唤真嗣前往地狱的恶魔。“来吧，孩子。一切都会好起来的。跟我们在一起你会安全的。”

Shinji now looked behind him and saw that everyone had glowing red eyes. "No," said Shinji firmly. "I have something that I have to take care of. I wont be a coward anymore. I wont listen to you demons anymore."  
真嗣此刻回头一看，发现每个人的眼睛都闪着红光。“不，”真嗣坚定地说，“我有件必须要处理的事。我不会再当懦夫了。我不会再听你们这些恶魔的话了。”

With that Shinji turned his back on the shelter and walked away.  
说完，真嗣毅然决然地离开了避难所，背对着它走去。

---

Even though Shinji intended to look for Asuka he really had no idea where she was. Worse his noes which was still broken had started to bleed again and his vision was turning foggy again. 'God damn that Touji. If something happens to Asuka while I'm like this I will cut off his head,' he thought savagely.  
尽管真嗣打算去找明日香，但他其实根本不知道她在哪里。更糟糕的是，他那依然骨折的鼻子又开始流血，视线也再次变得模糊。‘该死的东治，如果我这样子的时候明日香出了什么事，我非砍了他的脑袋不可，’他恶狠狠地想。

Shinji suddenly caught his foot on the side walk and fell down hard on his chin. Shinji's teeth cut into his tongue and for a minute he thought that he had bitten his tongue off. Lying down on the side walk he spit and saw dark red in his saliva. 'Great by the time I find her I'll be a walking corpse.' Pushing himself off the ground he looked around. It appeared that he was the only person around still.  
真嗣突然绊倒在人行道上，重重地摔了个嘴啃泥。他的牙齿咬破了舌头，有那么一会儿，他以为自己把舌头咬断了。躺在人行道上，他吐了一口唾沫，看到唾液中带着暗红色。'太好了，等我找到她时，我已经是具行尸走肉了。'他用力撑起身体，环顾四周。看起来，他似乎是周围唯一的人。

'Damn it I've got to find her.' Pushing himself off the ground he suddenly fell back down when the ground start to shake. "What the fu-" was all he managed to say when the streets of Tokyo-3 started to bend and fold away into the ground. Turning around Shinji saw that the many skyscrapers where now being brought underground. Stunned at was happening he turned his head in every direction watching as buildings disappeared around him.  
'该死，我得找到她。'他用力撑起身体，突然地面开始摇晃，他又摔了回去。"搞什么鬼-"他刚开口，东京-3 的街道就开始弯曲折叠，沉入地下。真嗣转过身，看到许多摩天大楼正被带入地下。对眼前发生的一切感到震惊，他四处张望，看着建筑物在他周围消失。

"Shinji, hey Shinji, wake up, I SAID WAKE UP."  
“真嗣，嘿，真嗣，醒醒，我说了醒醒。”

Shinji felt a sharp pain to his already aching head and looked around to see Misato standing their with an anxious look on her face. "Shinji c'mon I've got to take you back to Nerv headquarters."  
真嗣感到本已疼痛的头部又是一阵剧痛，环顾四周，看到美里站在那里，脸上带着焦虑的表情。“真嗣，快点，我得带你回 NERV 总部。”

Shinji starred blankly back at her.  
真嗣茫然地回望着她。

"Shinji get up, you can't stay out here, its not safe."  
“真嗣，起来，你不能待在这里，这不安全。”

He continued to stare back at her.  
他继续盯着她。

"You wanted to help Asuka right?"  
“你想帮助明日香，对吧？”

This brought light to Shinji's eyes and he slowly stood up. "Asuka is at Nerv?"  
这使真嗣的眼睛亮了起来，他缓缓站起身。“明日香在 NERV 吗？”

Misato was afraid of how much she should tell Shinji. "Yes and I'll tell you about everything later, so lets go."  
美里担心自己该告诉真嗣多少。“是的，我稍后会把一切都告诉你，所以我们走吧。”

Shinji simply nodded and jumped into the passenger seat and Misato drove off.  
真嗣只是点点头，跳进了副驾驶座，美里便开车离开了。

---

Ten minutes later Shinji and Misato where on an elevator that was bringing them deep underground. Shinji thought that this was Nerv headquarters but never would have thought that it was directly under his feet. Finally getting control of his voice Shinji asked the question that had been nagging at him for the past ten minutes. 'Misato why are all the buildings of Tokyo-3 going underground? And why has an air raid siren been issued?"  
十分钟后，真嗣和美里在一部电梯里，电梯正将他们带到地下深处。真嗣以为这是 NERV 总部，但从未想过它就在自己脚下。终于控制住自己的声音，真嗣问出了过去十分钟一直困扰他的问题。“美里，为什么东京-3 的所有建筑都在向地下延伸？还有，为什么发布了空袭警报？”

Since Shinji had come this far Misato figured it would be best to answer some of his questions. "An Angel will be here soon and it will try to destroy us. Thats the best explanation I can give you right now, later I'll go into more detail later."  
既然真嗣已经走到了这一步，美里认为最好回答他的一些问题。“使徒很快就会来到这里，它会试图摧毁我们。这是我目前能给你的最好解释，稍后我会详细说明。”

"OK and please tell me, what is Asuka doing here, is it dangerous."  
“好的，请告诉我，明日香在这里做什么，这危险吗？”

Misato was silent for a minute before she said, "Lets just say that when everything is done she'll be glad that your here."  
美里沉默了一会儿，然后说：“这么说吧，当一切结束后，她会很高兴你在这里。”

"What did you mean by an angel anyway."  
"你说的天使到底是什么意思。"

"I told you I can't go into specifics right now, I'll tell you about it later."  
"我告诉过你现在不能细说，晚点再跟你解释。"

Shinji was surprised that Misato had snapped at him and just sat back in his seat and waited. Whatever these angels were they were making Misato panic worse then Shinji had ever seen. "They must be what the air raid is about."  
真嗣对美里突然对他发火感到惊讶，只是坐回座位等待。无论这些天使是什么，它们让美里恐慌的程度超过了真嗣所见过的任何情况。“它们一定是这次空袭的原因。”

Several minutes later Shinji found himself being ushered into something that looked strangely like the great pyramids in Egypt.  
几分钟后，真嗣发现自己被带到了一个看起来奇怪地像埃及大金字塔的地方。

"Misato wha-" "美里，这——"

"Quiet Shinji, I promise I'll explain detail but right now I need to think. Why do I always get lost when its a situation like this."  
"安静，真嗣，我保证会详细解释，但现在我需要思考。为什么每次遇到这种情况我都会迷路。"

"Well, you were always known as a bit of an air head during college," said a voice behind them.  
“嗯，你在大学时总是有点儿头脑简单，”一个声音从他们身后传来。

Misato spun around and saw her old college friend and coworker Ritsuko Akagi standing their smirking at her. "Ritsuko thank God you found me you know I always get lost around here."  
美里转过身，看到她大学时代的老朋友兼同事赤木律子站在那里，正对她露出微笑。“律子，谢天谢地你找到我了，你知道我在这儿总是迷路。”

Ritsuko simply said, "Unit 02 launched moments ago to combat the angel."  
律子只是简单地说：“2 号机刚刚出击，去对抗使徒了。”

Misato's smile fell at this bit of news. "OK I'll proceeded to the command center to take control of operations. She turned to leave but Ritsuko caught her hand, "Who's the kid," she said pointing to Shinji?  
听到这个消息，美里微笑消失了。“好的，我会前往指挥中心接管行动。”她转身要走，但律子抓住了她的手，“这孩子是谁？”她指着真嗣问道？

"Oh...well, this is the commanders son, Shinji Ikari."  
“哦……嗯，这是指挥官的儿子，碇真嗣。”

Ritsuko's eyes widened at this. "I thought the commander told you that under no circumstances were you supposed to bring him to headquarters."  
律子听到这话，眼睛睁大了。“我记得指挥官告诉过你，无论如何都不能把他带到总部来。”

"I know but Asuk...well, I found him in the middle of the street while the buildings were retracting underground. I couldn't just leave him out in the open. Also he seemed rather distressed."  
"我知道，但明日香...嗯，我在建筑物正在缩回地下的街道中央发现了他。我不能就这样把他丢在外面。而且他看起来相当不安。"

Ritsuko gave Misato a funny look before turning around and saying, "Fine but this is on your head and I have nothing to do with this. Just don't let anything happen to Unit 02."  
律子给了美里一个奇怪的表情，然后转过身说："好吧，但这事你自己负责，我可不掺和。只是别让零二号机出什么事。"

Misato looked at the back of her friend for a few seconds before turning to Shinji, grabbing his wrist and steering him in the correct direction.  
美里盯着她朋友的背影几秒钟，然后转向真嗣，抓住他的手腕，引导他走向正确的方向。

---

Shinji soon found himself in a wide room filled with computers and personal at each computer. In front of him was a massive screen that showed many different parts of Tokyo-3. He turned to ask Misato a question but saw that she was now issuing order to everyone  
不久，真嗣发现自己身处一个宽敞的房间，每台电脑前都坐着人。他面前是一块巨大的屏幕，显示着东京-3 的多个不同区域。他转身想向美里提问，却看到她正在向众人下达指令。

"What's the status of Unit 02?"  
“二号机的状态如何？”

"Pilots heart rate is seventy heart beats per minute. Sync rate is at a steady sixty-three with no signs of dropping. Umbilical cable is still attached."  
“驾驶员心率每分钟七十次。同步率稳定在六十三，没有下降迹象。脐带电缆仍连接着。”

"What about the angel...what are we calling this one?"  
"关于那个天使...我们怎么称呼这个？"

"Sachiel ma'am." "萨基尔女士。"

"Very well, what is the status of Sachiel."  
"很好，萨基尔的状况如何？"

"Computers show that its currently off the coast of Tokyo-3."  
"计算机显示它目前位于第三新东京市海岸外。"

"We are certain its an angel correct."  
"我们确定那是使徒，对吧。"

"Hai, pattern blue has been confirmed."  
"是的，已确认是蓝色模式。"

"OK, send up the rifles for Unit 02. Unit 02 will attack and destroy the enemy. What about Unit 00 by the way, has Rei recuperated enough yet to pilot it yet?"  
"好的，让 02 号单位准备好步枪。02 号单位将发起攻击并摧毁敌人。顺便问一下，00 号单位的情况如何，绫波恢复到可以驾驶了吗？"

"As for as I know no. Her right arm is still broken so she is not able to pilot it."  
"据我所知还不行。她的右臂仍然骨折，所以她还不能驾驶。"

"Very well...put Unit 01 on standby."  
"很好……让 01 号单位待命。"

Everyone looked at her. "Unit 01, I thought it was on an indefinite freeze?"  
所有人都看着她。“初号机，我以为它被无限期冻结了？”

"If we have to we will unfreeze it."  
“如果有必要，我们会解冻它。”

"What about the pilot?" “那驾驶员呢？”

Misato ignored the question and turned to the overhead screen. "Unit 02 I want you to engage the enemy away from Tokyo-3 attack it while its still off the coast."  
美里无视了这个问题，转向头顶的屏幕。“二号机，我要求你将敌人引离第三新东京市，趁它还在海岸线外时攻击它。”

"Hai," came a familiar voice over the speakers which Shinji recognized immediately.  
“明白，”扬声器中传来一个熟悉的声音，真嗣立刻就认了出来。

"As-u-ka?" “明日香？”

Misato heard him and looked around to see him starring at the screen in horror. Unit 02 was currently displayed on the screen fighting the angel. Unit 02 was painting in a bright red color which was to Asuka's liking. In its hand was a rifle which was currently zoomed in on the slowly approaching angel.  
美里听到他的声音，环顾四周，看到他正惊恐地盯着屏幕。屏幕上显示着 02 号机正在与使徒战斗。02 号机涂着鲜艳的红色，这正合明日香的心意。它手中握着一把步枪，目前正对准缓缓逼近的使徒进行瞄准。

"Asuka," said Shinji a little louder this time.  
“明日香，”真嗣这次稍微提高了声音说道。

Misato turned quickly to face him but to late. Shinji had darted to the nearest computer and wrapped his arms around the neck of the person stationed their, and pulled him backwards out of his chair. Standing over the microphone panting slightly he yelled into the microphone, "ASUKA WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER."  
美里迅速转身面对他，但为时已晚。真嗣已经冲到最近的电脑前，用双臂勒住坐在那里的人的脖子，将他向后拉出椅子。他站在麦克风前，微微喘息着，对着麦克风大喊：“明日香，你为什么要这样做？你不必让自己置身险境。”

Whether she heard him or not she gave no reply. Shinji was about to yell into again when he felt someone grab his wrist and drag him backwards before hitting him in the side of the face.  
无论她是否听到，她都没有回应。真嗣正要再次大喊时，突然感到有人抓住他的手腕，将他向后拖去，随后一拳打在他的脸颊上。

Shinji wasn't sure what number that made it today but he felt that his brain had finally popped loose and was floating freely in his head. Looking up slightly dazed he saw an angry Misato standing over him.  
真嗣不确定今天这是第几次了，但他感觉自己的脑子终于松动了，正自由地漂浮在脑袋里。他有些恍惚地抬头，看到愤怒的美里站在他面前。

"What do you think your doing," she hissed at him. "Under no circumstances are we allowed to bother the pilots while their in combat. I took you here knowing what charges I would face. Asuka however begged me to find you and make sure you were all right. And now you go pulling a stunt like this and-"  
“你以为你在做什么？”她低声呵斥他，“在任何情况下，我们都不允许在驾驶员战斗时打扰他们。我带你来这里，明知会面临什么指控。然而，明日香却恳求我找到你，确保你没事。现在你却做出这种事——”

Suddenly she was interrupted by one of the computer operators. "Unit 02's sync rate has dropped down to fifty-seven, fifty-six...still dropping."  
突然，一名电脑操作员打断了她。“二号机的同步率已经下降到五十七，五十六……还在继续下降。”

Misato cursed. "Keep monitoring her sync rate and heart rate let me know instantly if anything happens. What's the status on Unit 01?"  
美里咒骂了一声。“继续监控她的同步率和心率，一旦有任何情况立即通知我。初号机的情况如何？”

"The commander has lifted the freeze around it and has instructed you to do as you see fit. Though he said that under no circumstances does he want Unit 01 destroyed."  
“指挥官已经解除了对它的冻结，并指示您自行决定行动。不过他明确表示，在任何情况下都不希望初号机被摧毁。”

"I don't think he will have to worry about that."  
"我想他不必为此担心。"

Grabbing Shinji who was now sobbing on the floor she said, "If you want to help Asuka then follow my instructions."  
她抓住了在地上哭泣的真嗣，说道：“如果你想帮助明日香，那就听从我的指示。”

Shinji nodded and let her steer him towards his future.  
真嗣点点头，任由她引领自己走向未来。

---

Shinji was soon standing in front of Eva Unit 01. It looked like a demon more then anything that was supposed to defend mankind. On the way to Unit 01 Misato filled him in on everything from, the angels, Second Impact, the Eva's, and the purpose of Nerv. Shinji was now standing looking at Unit 01 digesting all the information that he had absorbed. Though throughout all Misato's information she left out everything about why Asuka was risking her life to protect him and everyone else. Shinji never would have guessed she would do that.  
真嗣很快站在了 EVA 初号机前。它看起来更像一个恶魔，而非本应守护人类的机器。前往初号机的路上，美里向他详细介绍了天使、第二次冲击、EVA 以及 NERV 的使命。真嗣现在站在初号机前，消化着所吸收的所有信息。尽管美里提供了大量信息，但她对为什么明日香会冒着生命危险保护他和所有人只字未提。真嗣从未料到她会这么做。

"Shinji," said a sudden booming voice.  
“真嗣，”一个突如其来的洪亮声音说道。

Shinji looked up past Unit 01 to a window at the top of the dock to see his father starring down at him.  
真嗣抬头望向初号机上方，码头顶端的窗户，看到他的父亲正俯视着他。

"Otou-san" "父亲大人"

"Shinji, do you know what piloting this Eva will do to change your life."  
"真嗣，你知道驾驶这个 Eva 会给你的生活带来怎样的改变吗？"

"Hai...and I'm prepared to take that responsibility. I will...protect Asuka and mankind."  
"是的...我已经准备好承担这个责任。我会...保护明日香和人类。"

His father continued to stare down at him. "Just remember that mankind as a whole is more important than a single individual."  
他的父亲继续低头盯着他。“记住，人类整体比单一个体更为重要。”

Shinji felt boiling rage at his father. 'So Asuka is just a simple object that lets you fulfill your objectives just like your using me now.'  
真嗣对他的父亲感到怒火中烧。‘所以明日香只是你实现目标的一个简单工具，就像你现在利用我一样。’

---

Gendo Ikari now cut the link between his son and himself and turned away to see his second in command Kozo Fuyutsuki standing their frowning at him.  
碇源堂切断了与儿子之间的联系，转身看到他的副手葛城美里站在那里，皱着眉头看着他。

"Is it wise to let your son pilot Unit 01."  
"让儿子驾驶初号机，明智吗？"

"Maybe not but with his help the Human Instrumentality Project will be sped up significantly. Its a risk I'm willing to take."  
"或许不明智，但有了他的帮助，人类补完计划将大大加速。这个风险我愿意承担。"

"What if _it_ happens." "万一发生了呢？"

"I have prepared for this day considerably. If _it_ does happen then I have taken the correct measures to prevent _it_ from getting out of hand. Also I still need Unit 02, for a while, so I don't want to lose it yet."  
“我已经为这一天做了充分的准备。如果真的发生了，我已经采取了正确的措施来防止事态失控。而且，我还需要 02 号机一段时间，所以现在还不想失去它。”

Kozo looked back at his friend. It was amazing how he could show so little emotion even when talking to his son. "If you think its worth it then we'll take it"  
“小藏回头看向他的朋友。令人惊叹的是，即使在与儿子交谈时，他也能表现出如此少的情感。“如果你认为值得，那我们就接受它。”

---

Shinji was sitting inside the entry plug inside Unit 01. He had received a shock when the plug had started to fill up with a clear fluid. He had at first panicked but relaxed when Misato said that it was to help him breath easier. Shinji felt slightly nauseous thought. It smelled like death somehow.  
“真嗣坐在 01 号机的插入栓内。当插入栓开始充满透明液体时，他受到了惊吓。起初他惊慌失措，但当美里说这是为了让他呼吸更顺畅时，他放松了下来。不过，真嗣还是感到有些恶心。不知为何，它闻起来像死亡的味道。”

"Shinji are you ready then."  
"真嗣，你准备好了吗？"

"Ha-hai." "哈-嗨。"

"Okay Asuka's Eva has just lost its umbilical cable so she has only five minutes left of energy left. We're sending you up elevator number five. It will put you closest to her position. When you get to the surface provide covering fire her while she dispatches the angel. Since you don't have any sync training this is as much as we expect of you."  
"好的，明日香的 EVA 刚刚失去了脐带电缆，所以她只剩下五分钟的能量了。我们派你乘坐五号电梯上去，它会把你送到离她最近的位置。当你到达地面时，为她提供掩护火力，同时她会处理掉那个使徒。由于你没有进行过同步训练，我们对你期望仅此而已。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

"Okay then release primary and secondary locks numbers one through thirteen. Have Eva Unit 01 proceeded to elevator number five."  
"好的，那么解除一到十三号主次锁定。让 Eva 初号机前往五号电梯。"

Shinji felt his Eva Unit being slowly moved forward on tracks that he couldn't see from where he was.  
真嗣感觉到他的 Eva 初号机正被看不见的轨道缓缓向前移动。

"What is Eva Unit 01's pilot sync rate," asked Misato.  
“EVA 初号机的驾驶员同步率是多少？”美里问道。

"Barely above the minimum forty-seven."  
“勉强高于最低的四十七。”

"Well, for a first time, its amazing. OK Eva Unit 01 at launch elevator. Release and close elevator shafts two, four, and seven. Propulsion system is all green. Sending Unit 01 to surface...now."  
“嗯，初次能做到这样已经很了不起了。好的，EVA 初号机，前往发射电梯。释放并关闭二号、四号和七号电梯井。推进系统一切正常。现在将初号机送往地面。”

Shinji was immediately jerked back into his seat as he felt himself rocketing up to the surface. 'Asuka please be okay,' he thought as he saw day light above him.  
真嗣立刻被猛地拽回座位，感觉自己正飞速冲向水面。'明日香，请一定要没事，'他想着，同时看到了上方的日光。

---

When Shinji first broke through to the surface he saw that Asuka and Unit 02 were being cornered against a building and was being hit repetitively.  
当真嗣首次破水而出时，他看到明日香和二号机被逼至一栋建筑旁，正遭受连续攻击。

"Damn it," yelled Shinji. "How the fuck do I even move this thing."  
“该死，”真嗣大喊，“这玩意儿到底怎么动啊。”

"Calm down Shinji," came Misato's voice. "Since the LCL fluid helps connect you to the Eva's mind all you have to do is think about moving and it will move. But you have to be concentrating really hard."  
"冷静点，真嗣，" 美里说道，"既然 LCL 液体有助于你与 Eva 的心灵连接，你只需集中精神想着移动，它就会动。但你必须非常专注。"

"Okay," said Shinji. He tried focusing on moving but an image of a slowly rotting Asuka kept on popping in his mind. 'No I promised her that I would help. I won't let that happen."  
"好的，" 真嗣说。他试图集中精力移动，但脑海中不断浮现出慢慢腐烂的明日香的形象。'不，我答应过她我会帮忙的。我不能让这种事发生。"

---

Misato was looking worriedly at the screen. "Unit 01 sync rate below minimum...what?"  
美里担忧地看着屏幕。"初号机同步率低于最低值...什么？"

Misato jerked over to the sound of the voice. "What?"  
美里听到声音猛地转过头。“什么？”

"Anomaly detected in the entry plug. Eva Unit 01 is rejecting the pilots thoughts."  
“插入栓内检测到异常。EVA 初号机正在排斥驾驶员的思维。”

"Quick eject the entry plug, protect the pilot."  
“快弹出插入栓，保护驾驶员。”

"Unable to, its rejecting the signature. Sync rate is dropping radically Eva Unit 01 has rejected the pilot and is shutting down. Life signs are dropping also. Unable to get a direct reading inside of Unit 01. Plug suit is not showing any vital signs."  
“无法执行，它在拒绝签名。同步率急剧下降，EVA 初号机已排斥驾驶员并正在关闭。生命迹象也在减弱。无法直接读取初号机内部情况。插入栓服未显示任何生命体征。”

Misato was standing horrified at Eva Unit 01. This was why no one was able to pilot it. It always rejected the pilot and killed it.  
美里站在 EVA 初号机前，惊恐万分。这就是为什么没人能驾驶它。它总是排斥驾驶员并将其杀死。

---

Inside the entry plug Shinji was gasping for breath. He had lost consciousness several times already but was still thinking over and over, 'move...move..move...move.'  
在插入栓内，真嗣喘息着。他已经多次失去意识，但仍一遍遍地想着，‘动啊...动啊...动啊...动啊...’

"GOD DAMN IT,' he screamed out loud. "I'VE GOT TO HELP ASUKA. DAMN YOU PILE OF SHIT MOVE...MOVE...move...mov-"  
"该死，'他大声咆哮。"我得去帮明日香。该死的破车，动啊...动...动...动-"

Shinji was slowly blacking out when he heard a voice in his head. 'So you want to help the person important to you.'  
真嗣渐渐失去意识时，他听到脑海中有个声音。'所以你想帮助对你重要的人。'

"Hai," he said weakly. "是的，"他虚弱地回答。

'Well I must say that out of all the pilots that have ever tried to sync with me you are easily the most interesting out of all of them. Your willpower is something to marvel at...very well I authorize you as the pilot of me Unit 01. From this day forth anybody else who tries to pilot me shall die upon entering this plug."  
“好吧，我必须承认，在所有试图与我同步的驾驶员中，你无疑是最引人注目的一个。你的意志力令人惊叹……很好，我授权你成为我的驾驶员，零一机。从今天起，任何试图驾驶我的人一旦进入驾驶舱，都将丧命。”

Shinji just smiled slightly and felt himself wake up. A faint green light was flashing on and off inside of the entry plug. It simply said Shinji Ikari.  
真嗣只是微微一笑，感觉自己醒了过来。驾驶舱内，一盏微弱的绿色灯光在闪烁。上面简单地写着：碇真嗣。

Suddenly Shinji felt white hot needles entering his skin. Looking down he saw that wires were digging into his skin and merging with his nerves. "What...are...you doing Unit 01."  
突然，真嗣感到皮肤像被滚烫的针刺入。低头一看，他发现电线正刺入他的皮肤，与他的神经融合。“零一机，你在做什么？”

'This is the only way to truly sync with me. With this I'm able to read your thought easier. Don't worry about the lose of blood. Its only temporary.'  
'这是唯一能与我真正同步的方法。这样一来，我能更容易读取你的思维。别担心失血，这只是暂时的。'

Now that Shinji looked he saw that a pool of blood was slowly building up around him, and that the LCL fluid was steadily turning into his own blood. 'Whatever,' he thought. 'As long as I save Asuka before I pass out I don't care.'  
现在，真嗣注意到自己周围正慢慢形成一滩血迹，LCL 液体也在逐渐变成他自己的血液。'无所谓了，'他想，'只要能在昏倒前救出明日香，我不在乎。'

'Thats what I like to hear,' said Eva Unit 01. 'Though if you don't mind its been a while since I was let loose like this so I'd like to have a little fun.'  
'我就喜欢你这种态度，'初号机说道，'不过，如果你不介意的话，我已经有段时间没这么自由了，所以我想稍微玩一玩。'

'What are you-' but then Shinji felt two hot wires pierce his temples and he knew no more.  
'你这是在——' 但随即，真嗣感到两股灼热如电的刺痛穿透了他的太阳穴，之后便一无所知了。

---

Shinji woke up to hear the sound of voices around him.  
真嗣醒来时，耳边环绕着周围的说话声。

"Its amazing that he survived with all the blood he lost."  
“他流了那么多血还能活下来，真是奇迹。”

"Even more amazing that Tokyo-3 isn't destroyed thanks to Unit 01 going berserk."  
"更令人惊叹的是，多亏了零号机发狂，第三新东京市竟然没有被摧毁。"

"Tell me what happened when you opened the entry plug again Misato?"  
"告诉我，当你再次打开插入栓时发生了什么，美里？"

"Shinji was just floating their with his plug suit on. All the controls had disappeared and he had those weird wires connected all along his body. What was even more disturbing was that the LCL fluid had mixed with his blood."  
"真嗣就那样穿着插入服漂浮在那里。所有的控制装置都消失了，他身上布满了奇怪的电线。更令人不安的是，LCL 液体已经和他的血液混合在一起了。"

"Doctor Akagi is that even possible?"  
"Doctor Akagi，这真的可能吗？"

"Theoretically yes, though its never been proven before."  
"理论上是的，尽管以前从未被证实过。"

Shinji slowly opened his eyes and saw a crowd of people around him.  
真嗣缓缓睁开眼睛，发现自己被一群人围着。

"Well, at least the angel was dispatched."  
"好吧，至少天使已经被派遣了。"

"Yes and thankfully Asuka had enough energy to disconnect Unit 01's umbilical cable or Unit 01 would still be rampaging around Tokyo-3."  
"是的，幸好明日香还有足够的能量断开 01 号机的脐带电缆，否则 01 号机还会在第三新东京市肆虐。"

Shinji opened his eyes wide at the mention of Asuka's named and looked back at everyone that was crowded around his bed, most of them which he had never seen before.  
听到明日香的名字，真嗣睁大了眼睛，回头看着围在他床边的众人，其中大多数他从未见过。

"What, where am I," he asked?  
"什么，我在哪里？" 他问道。

"Nerv hospital," replied Misato.  
"NERV 医院，" 美里回答道。

"What...how...I." "什么...怎么...我。"

"Calm down Shinji, everything is okay. The angel was defeated."  
"冷静点，真嗣，一切都好。使徒已经被打败了。"

Suddenly Shinji sat bolt upright which surprised everyone. "What happened to Asuka, where is she."  
突然，真嗣猛地坐直了身子，这让所有人都吃了一惊。“明日香怎么了，她在哪儿？”

"Right here baka." "就在这儿，笨蛋。"

Shinji looked around and saw Misato and Ritsuko move out of the way as Asuka walked up to Shinji's bed.  
真嗣环顾四周，看到美里和律子让开了路，让明日香走到真嗣的床边。

Misato motioned to Ritusko and everyone else to let the two be alone, and they left the room leaving the two teens to sort things out.  
美里示意律子和其他人让这对年轻人单独相处，他们便离开了房间，留下两个少年去解决问题。

With everyone gone Asuka sat down on the edge of Shinji's bed and looked out the window. Shinji meanwhile sat back down and was somehow comforted that she was next to him.  
所有人都离开后，明日香坐在真嗣床边，望向窗外。与此同时，真嗣也坐了回去，不知为何，她在他身边让他感到安慰。

"Why did you do that," asked Asuka breaking the silence.  
“你为什么要那么做？”明日香打破了沉默问道。

"Err do what," replied Shinji.  
“呃，做什么？”真嗣回答道。

Asuka turned to face him, took a deep breath and said, "Why did you risk your life, to the point of bleeding to death to help me."  
明日香转向他，深吸了一口气，说道：“你为什么要冒着生命危险，甚至流血至死来帮我。”

Shinji didn't even need to think about. "Well, this may sound stupid to you...and I don't care what you think but, even though we argue a lot and don't seem to get along...you're the first person that I've been able to talk to easily. I guess you could say that your my first friend."  
真嗣甚至不需要思考。“嗯，这对你来说可能听起来很蠢……而且我不在乎你怎么想，但尽管我们经常争吵，看起来相处得并不好……你是我第一个能轻松交谈的人。我想你可以说，你是我的第一个朋友。”

"You mean you've never had friends before me?"  
“你是说，在我之前你从来没有过朋友？”

"No, I've always been on the move my entire life. My father sent me from place to place so I never got to know people. Eventually I just shut everyone out around me since I knew that I would only be leaving eventually."  
“是的，我一生都在四处奔波。我父亲把我从一个地方送到另一个地方，所以我从没机会认识人。最终，我只是把自己封闭起来，因为我知道我迟早会离开。”

"Is that why you seem to hate your father so much?"  
"那就是你为什么似乎如此憎恨你父亲的原因吗？"

"Yes,"...'That and the fact that he abandoned me and let my mother die,' though Shinji thought this to himself.  
"是的，"...'还有他抛弃了我，让我母亲死去的事实，' 虽然真嗣只是在心里这么想。

Asuka was furious for some reason at Shinji. "You baka, I can take care of myself."  
不知为何，明日香对真嗣感到愤怒。"你这个笨蛋，我能照顾好自己。"

"I know its just-" Shinji didn't want to tell her about the vision he had of her rotting corpse.  
"我知道这只是——" 真嗣不想告诉她关于她腐烂尸体的幻象。

"Just what?" “什么意思？”

"Nothing, forget about it."  
"没什么，忘了吧。"

They both sat in silence for a while, then Asuka asked the next question. "What happened to you anyway...back their inside Eva Unit 01. It went berserk and tried to destroy everything in sight, including me...you weren't controlling it were you?"  
他们俩沉默地坐了一会儿，然后明日香问了下一个问题。"你到底怎么了……在那边，在 Eva 初号机里。它发狂了，试图摧毁视线中的一切，包括我……你不是在控制它，对吧？"

"No, Asuka I could never harm you. I don't remember much after I blacked out, but the Eva said that it would protect you if I let it have a little fun"  
"不，明日香，我绝不会伤害你。我昏迷后记不太清了，但 Eva 说只要让它稍微玩一下，它就会保护你。"

"So you didn't care what happened to Tokyo-3, as long as I was safe you were happy?"  
"所以你不在乎东京-3 发生什么，只要我安全你就满意了？"

"Hai, something like." "嗯，差不多是这样。"

"You baka, I'm not worth it."  
"你这个笨蛋，我不值得你这样。"

"Sorry...I just didn't want to lose you," suddenly his eyes narrowed. "And don't say that your not worth it, because you are," her words had brought back what his father had said about one individual compared to humanity.  
"对不起...我只是不想失去你，"突然他的眼神变得锐利。"而且不要说你不值得，因为你值得，"她的话让他想起了父亲曾经说过关于一个人与整个人类的比较。

"You honestly care that much about me," asked Asuka?  
"你真的这么在乎我吗？" 明日香问道？

"Yes I do...well when your like this at least."  
"是的，我确实...至少当你这样的时候。"

"Meaning what exactly," Asuka snapped back.  
"具体是什么意思？" 明日香厉声反问。"

Shinji was entering dangerous water but plunged ahead stubbornly, "Just that when your angry and moody your not that much fun to be around."  
真嗣正踏入危险的水域，但他固执地继续说："只是觉得当你生气和情绪低落时，和你在一起就没那么有趣了。"

"What was that you baka. If you weren't so badly injured I'd give a good whack on the head...but instead I'll do this. Slowly reaching around Shinji's neck she brought him into a small one armed hug. "Thanks for worrying about me...though if you ever say I'm not fun to be around when I'm angry I guarantee that you'll make up in the middle of the night breathing through your mouth."  
"你这个笨蛋，刚才那是什么。如果不是你伤得这么重，我真想好好敲一下你的头...不过现在，我只能这样。她缓缓地绕到真嗣的脖子旁，用一只手臂轻轻地抱住了他。“谢谢你担心我...不过如果你敢说我生气时不好相处，我保证你会半夜醒来只能用嘴呼吸。”

"You know its not very threatening when you're hugging me and telling me that at the same time."  
"你一边抱着我一边说这种话，实在没什么威胁力。"

Asuka broke apart from him now and gave him a weird look before she started laughing, and Shinji joined in.  
明日香松开了他，给了他一个奇怪的眼神，然后开始大笑，真嗣也跟着笑了起来。

When Asuka stopped laughing the first thing she said was, "You need to get to sleep now. Ritsuko says that you need to spend two days here until you recover. You lost a lot of blood and it wouldn't be good for you to pass out while at Misato's apartment."  
当明日香停止笑声后，她说的第一件事是：“你现在需要去睡觉了。律子说你需要在这里待上两天直到恢复。你失血过多，在美里公寓里昏倒可不好。”

"Yeah your probably right."  
“嗯，你大概是对的。”

They both looked at each other for a while before Asuka said, "Well I'll check up on you after I get back from school I guess."  
她们彼此对视了一会儿，然后明日香说：“好吧，我想我放学后会来看你的。”

"M'kay see you then." "好的，那到时候见。"

With that Asuka walked out of the hospital and Shinji leaned back to go to sleep but heard a ear splitting racket when Asuka left.  
说完，明日香走出了医院，真嗣则靠回椅背准备入睡，但明日香离开时却传来一阵震耳欲聋的噪音。

"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING. WHERE YOU JUST LISTENING INTO OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION."  
"你们他妈的在干什么？难道一直在偷听我们的对话吗？"

Shinji had to suppress a laugh as he rolled over, 'Typical Asuka,' he thought before he drifted off to sleep.  
真嗣翻身时不得不忍住笑意，'典型的明日香，'他想道，随后便沉沉睡去。

### Chapter 3: Visions 
第三章：幻象  

**OK well, against me better judgement I am posting chapter 3. This is...I don't know how to phrase it other than I'm amazed at how this chapter ended up. Lets just say that I hit off some of the more psychological aspects with this one and it in turn developed into the story which I intend on writing now. Funny how that works with me. I never find out how the story is going until I write the first few chapters. Anyway enough of my rambling...  
好吧，尽管违背我的判断，我还是发布了第三章。这...我不知道该如何表达，除了惊讶于这一章的结局。这么说吧，我触及了一些更心理层面的内容，结果它发展成了我现在打算写的故事。有趣的是，我总是要写完前几章才能知道故事的走向。好了，我的唠叨就到此为止...**

---

Gendo Ikari was looking down at the manila envelope on his desk. "Is this the data that you received from the first fight between the third angel and the pilot of Eva Unit 01?"  
碇源堂低头看着桌上的牛皮纸信封。“这是你在第三次使徒与 EVA 初号机驾驶员第一次战斗中收到的数据吗？”

"Hai," replied Ritsuko who was standing in front of the commanders desk.  
"嗨，" 站在指挥官办公桌前的律子回答道。

"And," asked Gendo in a evened voice? "What have you found."  
"那么，" 源堂用平稳的语气问道？"你发现了什么。

"Are you asking to give me a summary of that report."  
"你是要我给你总结那份报告吗。

Gendo nodded his head and waited for a reply.  
源堂点了点头，等待着回复。

Taking a deep breath Ritsuko started talking. "It seems that at first Eva Unit 01 rejected Shinji's synchronization. Though for some reason the Eva allowed him to pilot it after Shinji became upset about something."  
深吸一口气，律子开始讲述。“起初，EVA 初号机似乎拒绝了真嗣的同步。但不知为何，真嗣因为某事变得沮丧后，EVA 却允许他驾驶了。”

"Does this pertain to Pilot 02."  
“这与二号驾驶员有关吗？”

"Hai, I believe so. Shinji was screaming something about Asuka and from what I have determined the Eva saw how much willpower Shinji possessed and allowed him to pilot it."  
"海，我相信是的。真嗣一直在尖叫关于明日香的事情，根据我的判断，Eva 看到了真嗣所拥有的意志力，因此允许他驾驶。"

"Is he still usable as a pilot?"  
"他还能作为驾驶员使用吗？"

"I can't confirm that without sync tests, commander."  
"没有同步测试，我无法确认这一点，指挥官。"

Gendo continued to look at her evenly waiting for her to continue.  
源渡继续平静地看着她，等待她继续说下去。

"Now, about Eva Unit 01's reaction. It seems that something happened inside of the entry plug between Shinji and the Eva. This is confirmed by Misato Katsuragi's testimony of what she discovered when the entry plug was removed and the LCL fluid was removed."  
“现在，关于 EVA 初号机的反应。似乎在真嗣和 EVA 之间，插入栓内发生了什么。这一点得到了葛城美里关于她在移除插入栓和 LCL 液体时所发现情况的证词的证实。”

"Meaning?" “什么意思？”

"What were originally thought to be metallic wires are the Eva's nerves. Apparently they connected directly with Shinji's nervous system so as to sync with him better. According to analysis when they synced the ratio was well above Asuka's highest ratio. It also seems that Eva Unit 01 will reject anybody that enters the entry plug and is not Shinji. We had a scientist exam the inside of the entry plug while it was inserted into the Eva. Apparently he suffered from a high level of contamination."  
"最初被认为是金属线的其实是 EVA 的神经。显然，它们直接与真嗣的神经系统相连，以便更好地同步。根据分析，当他们同步时，比例远超明日香的最高比例。似乎 EVA 初号机会排斥任何进入插入栓且不是真嗣的人。我们让一位科学家在插入栓插入 EVA 时检查其内部。显然，他遭受了高水平的污染。""

"Is that all?" "就这些吗？""

"One last thing, sir. I don't know why but when Shinji's blood mixed with the LCL fluid it omitted a reaction similar to the same pattern that an angel gives off."  
"还有最后一件事，长官。我不知道为什么，但当真嗣的血液与 LCL 液体混合时，它产生了一种类似于使徒发出的反应模式。""

"Pattern blue?" "蓝色模式？"

"Hai sir. Whatever changed with the LCL fluid made the AT field of the Eva stronger for a brief period."  
"是的，长官。LCL 液体的变化使得 EVA 的 AT 力场在短时间内变得更强了。"

Gendo leaned back in his chair now with his hands in his lap.  
碇源堂向后靠在椅子上，双手放在膝上。

"Very well then Ritsuko. If that is all you may go."  
"很好，那么，律子。如果没别的事，你可以走了。"

"Hai, commander Ikari." "明白，碇司令。"

When Ritsuko left Gendo picked up the manila file and leafed through it before pausing on a picture of his son. "Maybe I should have never brought him to Tokyo-3 in the first place."  
当律子离开后，碇源堂拿起那份马尼拉纸文件，翻阅着，直到目光停留在他儿子的照片上。"也许我一开始就不该把他带到第三新东京市。"

"And yet thanks to him we now are able to use Eva Unit 01 to its full potential," said Kozo as he stepped out of the shadows. "Though having him around still proves to be a risk."  
"然而多亏了他，我们现在能够充分发挥 Eva 初号机的全部潜力，" 高雄从阴影中走出说道。"尽管有他在身边仍然是个风险。"

"He was always a risk but we took it and see what happened."  
"他一直是个风险，但我们还是冒了这个险，看看发生了什么。"

"Yes but Ritsako's data didn't give you anything that you didn't know already."  
"是的，但律子的数据并没有给你带来任何你原本不知道的信息。"

Gendo frowned and looked down at the envelope. "Maybe, but the information about Shinji and Pilot 02 could prove to be useful."  
源堂皱了皱眉，低头看着那封信封。“或许吧，但关于真嗣和二号驾驶员的信息可能会证明是有用的。”

"Meaning," asked Kozo with a raised eyebrow.  
“你的意思是？” 高雄挑起眉毛问道。

Gendo smirked, "He's got a reason to pilot Eva Unit 01 as long as Pilot 02 is still working with Nerv."  
源堂冷笑道，“只要二号驾驶员还在与 NERV 合作，他就有理由继续驾驶 EVA 初号机。”

---

Shinji was released from the hospital two days later in a full recovery. Misato threw a party for him in his return. Though it consisted of Misato, Ritsuko, and a rather reluctant Asuka.  
两天后，真嗣完全康复出院了。美里为他举办了一个欢迎回家派对。虽然参加的只有美里、律子和一个不太情愿的明日香。

"Ah why do I have to celebrate this. Its so stupid. Its the baka's own fault for ending up like that in the first place."  
“啊，为什么我非得庆祝这个。真是蠢透了。说到底，那笨蛋自己搞成那样，怪得了谁。”

Misato paused in the middle of chugging a can of beer. "Asuka the least you could be is somewhat relieved he's at least alive."  
美里正大口喝着一罐啤酒，停了下来。“明日香，至少你可以为他还活着感到一丝欣慰吧。”

Shinji sighed and said, "Really Misato I don't care that much whether she's glad I'm here or not."  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“真的，美里，我并不太在乎她是否高兴我在这里。”

Asuka threw Shinji a scowl and stood up and walked toward her door and slammed it shut.  
明日香瞪了真嗣一眼，站起身走向自己的房门，砰的一声关上了。

Ritsuko sighed and turned to Misato, "I heard that Kaji has been reassigned here."  
律子叹了口气，转向美里，“我听说加持已经被调到这里了。”

Misato responded by spitting out her beer spraying Shinji in the face. "WHAT, THAT JERK IS STATIONED HERE."  
美里回应的方式是吐出啤酒，喷了真嗣一脸。“什么，那个混蛋被调到这里来了。”

"Hai," said Ritsuko calmly.  
“是，”律子平静地说。

"Who's Kaji," asked Shinji.  
“谁是加持？”真嗣问道。

Misato was about to open her mouth and say he was a stuck up jerk and a pervert when Ritsuko answered for her, "He's Misato's ex boyfriend."  
美里正要张嘴说他是个自以为是的混蛋兼变态，这时律子替她回答了，“他是美里的前男友。”

Shinji was rather shocked at that and looked to see Misato steadily turning red in the face. "As if I need reminding that a dated that damn jerk." Misato turned her gaze to Shinji, "How is school going for you now?"  
真嗣对此颇为震惊，转头看到美里的脸正逐渐变红。“好像我需要提醒自己曾经和那个该死的混蛋交往过似的。”美里将目光转向真嗣，“你现在学校情况怎么样？”

Shinji shrugged and said, "Little different then normal. Except all the guys in the class hate me."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“和平时有点不一样。只是班上所有男生都讨厌我。”

"Why's that?" "为什么呢？"

"Because I live with Asuka, their jealous. Heh I'd like to see them try living with her for a day and survive."  
"因为我跟明日香住在一起，他们嫉妒了。呵，我倒想看看他们试着跟她住一天还能不能活下来。"

"I heard that you asshole," came a voice through a closed door.  
"我听到你这个混蛋的话了，"一个声音从关着的门后传来。"

Shinji sighed and looked at his watch. "Uh I just got back and its time for school already."  
真嗣叹了口气，看了看手表。"呃，我刚回来，又该去学校了。"

"Well, here then," said Misato as she tossed Shinji a lunch.  
"那么，给你，"美里说着将一份午餐扔给了真嗣。

Shinji tried not to look disgusted and gave her a weak smile, "Uh thanks Misato."  
真嗣尽量不表现出厌恶，给了她一个虚弱的微笑，"呃，谢谢美里。"

"No problem, theirs one for Asuka too."  
"不客气，也给明日香准备了一份。"

Shinji could hardly suppress a groan.  
真嗣几乎忍不住要呻吟出声。

"Oh and Shinji I promised you that I would take you shopping for new clothes but I won't be back till late tonight. So I want Asuka to take you instead."  
“哦对了，真嗣，我答应过要带你去买新衣服的，但我今晚要很晚才能回来。所以我想让明日香带你去。”

"WHAT THE FUCK," came a loud yell from another room.  
“搞什么鬼，”另一个房间传来一声大喊。

Asuka immediately stormed out of her room and planted both hands on the table. "What the fuck do you mean I'm supposed to take this baka out shopping," she said this while pointing at Shinji. "Thats something that a mother should do."  
明日香立刻冲出房间，双手重重地拍在桌子上。“你他妈什么意思，让我带这个笨蛋去购物？”她一边说一边指向真嗣，“这种事应该是妈妈做的。”

"Think of this as a time to get to know each other a little better so you wont be arguing all the time because to tell you the truth I'm getting annoyed with it."  
“把这当作一个增进彼此了解的机会吧，这样你们就不会总是争吵了，说实话，我对此已经感到厌烦了。”

"If this baka wasn't such an idiot and a sociopath maybe I could get along with him. But he's had about as much social interaction between two humans beings as the teachers pet, First Child."  
“如果这个笨蛋不是这么白痴和反社会，也许我能和他相处得来。但他的人际交往能力简直就像老师的宠儿，第一适格者一样糟糕。”

Misato sighed, "This is exactly what I mean. Your constant bickering is enough to drive anyone crazy."  
美里叹了口气，“这正是我想说的。你们没完没了的争吵足以把人逼疯。”

"Hell no I'm not doing this," said Asuka while folding her arm.  
“绝对不干，”明日香一边说一边抱起双臂。

"Then how bout this. I'm _ordering_ you to take Shinji shopping."  
“那这样如何。我命令你带真嗣去购物。”

"And if I refuse." "如果我拒绝呢。"

"Then we take you off Unit 02."  
"那我们就把你从二号机上撤下来。"

Asuka flinched at that. "Ah damn you Misato. Fine I'll take the damn baka downtown later."  
听到这话，明日香退缩了。"该死的美里。好吧，我晚点会带这个笨蛋去市区的。"

Asuka grabbed Shinji by the collar then and dragged him off to school.  
明日香抓住真嗣的衣领，拽着他向学校走去。

"Will those to ever get along," mused Ritsuko?  
“他们俩能和睦相处吗？”律子若有所思地说。

"Not in this lifetime," said Misato.  
“这一生是不可能了，”美里说。

---

School had become something of a hell for Shinji. All the guys in the class still hated him and were still jealous that he and Asuka walked to school together every morning. Though he wasn't sure why all the girls hated him also. Maybe it had something to do with them being jealous of Asuka.  
学校对真嗣来说已经成了某种地狱。班上的男生们依然恨他，依然嫉妒他和明日香每天早上一起上学。虽然他不明白为什么女生们也恨他。也许是因为她们嫉妒明日香。

"Hey," said Asuka as they walked into class. "You did pack our own lunches and not the ones that Misato gave you."  
“嘿，”明日香走进教室时说道，“你带的是我们自己准备的午餐，不是美里给你的那些吧。”

"Hai," said Shinji as he handed her hers.  
“嗯，”真嗣说着递给她自己的那份。

She took it without another look at him and sat down at her desk. Shinji sighed and followed her and sat in his desk behind her.  
她接过东西，没再瞧他一眼，便坐回了自己的桌前。真嗣叹了口气，跟着她走过去，坐在她身后的座位上。

"Look how smug that bastard is about sitting close to Asuka."  
看看那混蛋坐在明日香旁边得意的样儿。

Shinji heard this and moved his eyes slightly to the left to see the boys who's names he didn't know were talking about him.  
真嗣听到这话，微微向左移动视线，看到了那些他不知道名字的男生正在议论他。

Immediately a rush of images hit him pertaining to the boy. Shinji found himself watching the boy walking into some magazine store and browsing some of the more explicit ones. Next second he was watching the person showering. What disgusted Shinji the most he was masturbating and screaming Asuka's name at the same time. 'What the fuck is this,' thought Shinji. 'Why am I thinking this...or I'm I somehow seeing what this guy does.'  
霎时间，一连串关于那男孩的画面涌入他的脑海。真嗣发现自己正看着那男孩走进一家杂志店，翻阅着一些更为露骨的杂志。下一秒，他看到那人在洗澡。最让真嗣恶心的是，那人一边自慰一边尖叫着明日香的名字。'这他妈是怎么回事，'真嗣心想。'为什么我会想到这些...还是我不知怎么地看到了这家伙的行为？'

Reality came back and Shinji found himself starring at the blackboard which the teacher had started scribbling on.  
现实回归，真嗣发现自己正盯着黑板，老师已经开始在上面涂写。

'C'mon to think of it,' thought Shinji. 'It seems...familiar somehow.' Then he thought of the corpse like Asuka in his mind, her right eyeball running free of its socket. How the ends of her fingers looked like they had been chewed off, leaving the bone.  
'来想想看，'真嗣心想。'这似乎...有些熟悉。'然后他想起了脑海中明日香那具尸体般的模样，她的右眼球脱离了眼眶。她的指尖像是被啃食过，只剩下骨头。

'NOOOO THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.'  
'不！那不可能发生。'

'But it will unless you stop it,' said Asuka.  
'但如果你不阻止，它就会发生，'明日香说。

'GOD DAMNIT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS.'  
'该死，我甚至不知道这是什么。'

"Hey baka." Shinji felt something rather hard slap him across the side of his face. He was pulled out of the nightmare to see Asuka frowning at him. "What," he said rather snappishly. Asuka simply pointed to the front of the room.  
"嘿，笨蛋。" 真嗣感到有什么硬物猛地打在了他的脸颊上。他从噩梦中惊醒，看到明日香正皱着眉头盯着他。"怎么了，" 他有些不耐烦地说。明日香只是指了指房间的前方。

"Shinji Ikari are you here."  
"碇真嗣，你在这里吗？"

"Ha-hai," Shinji felt his voice working overtime just to get the words out.  
"哈-哈伊，" 真嗣觉得自己的声音几乎要超负荷才能说出话来。

The teacher frowned at him and went back to his lecture.  
老师皱着眉头看了他一眼，又继续讲课了。

---

During lunch Shinji was leaning against the railing on the school roof thinking of what had happened to him during the morning. It seemed so realistic, whatever it was, and disturbing. The thing about Asuka still scared him though. He had thought that he had prevented it from happening but it looked like she could still die.  
午餐时，真嗣靠在学校屋顶的栏杆上，回想着上午发生在他身上的事情。那一切似乎如此真实，且令人不安。关于明日香的事依然让他感到恐惧。他本以为自己已经阻止了那件事的发生，但看起来她仍有可能死去。

'Damn it, what is happening to me. Am I some kind of psychic.' Really he wouldn't have put it past his own father to experiment on his newborn body.  
'该死，我到底是怎么了。难道我是什么心灵感应者吗？' 说真的，他不会怀疑自己的父亲在他刚出生时就在他身上做实验。

Suddenly he heard the door slamming open and saw that Asuka was striding over to him with a look of pure fury on her face. 'Great,' thought Shinji. 'What did I do this time?'  
突然，他听到门砰地一声被撞开，只见明日香怒气冲冲地朝他走来。'真棒，'真嗣心想。'这次我又做了什么？'

As she got closer he closed his eyes waiting for the hit to come, but it never did. Instead Asuka leaned up against the railing and threw her arms over the side. With that done she opened her mouth and screamed at the top of her voice. The sound echoed all across the academy grounds and Shinji had to cover his ears since she was next to him.  
当她走近时，他闭上眼睛等待着那一拳的到来，但它始终没有落下。相反，明日香靠在栏杆上，双臂搭在栏杆外。做完这些后，她张开嘴，用尽全力尖叫起来。声音在整个学院的场地上回荡，真嗣不得不捂住耳朵，因为她就在他旁边。

"What the hell was that about," asked Shinji?  
“这到底是怎么回事？”真嗣问道。

Asuka threw him a scowl before saying, "This school is a pain in the ass. I can think of a hundred things I could be doing right now. Plus all these perverted guys are starting to get on my nerves. A few actually tried to grope me."  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后说道：“这学校真是烦死人了。我现在能想到一百件我想做的事。而且这些色狼越来越让我受不了。有几个居然还想摸我。”

Shinji had to suppress a laugh, "So what happened to them?"  
真嗣强忍住笑，问道：“那他们后来怎么样了？”

"One of them has his fingers shoved up the drinking fountain faucet. While the other one actually tried to ambush me in the girls bathroom. He's got his head stuck half way down a toilet now."  
“其中一个手指被塞进了饮水机的出水口。另一个居然在女厕所埋伏我，现在他的头卡在马桶里一半。”

Shinji did laugh this time. It was a relief to have her anger directed at someone else for a change.  
这次真嗣笑了。她的怒火能转向别人，这让他松了一口气。

"So what was wrong with you earlier this morning?"  
“那你今天早上怎么了？”

Shinji's smile dropped when he heard her question. "Nothing," he said simply.  
听到她的问题，真嗣的笑容消失了。“没什么，”他简单地回答。

"Don't give my that crap. You were starring off into nothing. What are you some kind psychopath."  
"别跟我扯这些废话。你刚才明显在发呆。你是不是有什么心理问题啊。"

Shinji didn't want to have to listen to her bitching at a time like this and ignored her  
真嗣不想在这种时候还得听她唠叨，于是选择了无视她

Then the two of them heard voices coming up the stairs.  
接着，两人听到楼梯上传来声音。

"So you got the pictures right?"  
"所以你拍到了那些照片，对吧？"

"Yeah she was getting a drink at the fountain and I stuck my camera under her skirt a little and got a shot of it."  
"对，她正在喷泉边取水喝，我稍微把相机伸到她裙子下面，拍到了一张。"

"And...what color." "然后呢...是什么颜色的？"

"White unfortunately." "真可惜，是白色的。"

"Even so half the guys in the school will want a copy of it. We should sell it for five dollars a picture...what do you think."  
"即便如此，学校里一半的男生都会想要一份。我们应该每张照片卖五美元...你觉得呢？"

"Sounds fair enough, though we'll want to keep this low. If she finds out what were doing she'll kill us. I've heard she messed some guys up pretty bad for trying to grope her."  
"听起来挺合理的，不过我们得低调行事。如果她发现我们在做什么，她会杀了我们的。我听说她对那些试图非礼她的家伙下手很重。"

"But its not like we'll be walking down the hallways with signs saying, COME GET A PICTURE OF ASUKA'S UNDERWEAR FIVE DOLLARS A PICTURE."  
“但也不至于我们会在走廊里举着牌子说，‘来拍明日香的内裤照吧，五美元一张’。”

"No I guess not." “我想应该不会。”

The two of them continued laughing as they walked up the stairs to the roof. When they got over the last landing they froze when they saw Asuka and Shinji starring back at them. Shinji seemed somewhat amused, knowing what was gonna happen. Asuka however was starring back at Kensuke and Touji with a death grin on her face.  
两人继续笑着走上通往屋顶的楼梯。当他们跨过最后一级台阶时，看到明日香和真嗣正盯着他们，顿时僵住了。真嗣似乎有些幸灾乐祸，知道接下来会发生什么。而明日香则带着一副死亡微笑，盯着健介和斗志。

Kensuke realized only to late that any hope of making money was just destroyed.  
剑介意识到得太晚了，任何赚钱的希望刚刚都被摧毁了。

"Oh boys," said Asuka sweetly. "I think you have something that I need to look at."  
“哦，男孩们，”明日香甜甜地说道，“我想你们有些东西我需要看看。”

Kensuke and Touji turned around to make a run for it but Asuka grabbed the back of their shirts and held onto them tight.  
剑介和冬二转身想逃跑，但明日香抓住了他们衬衫的后摆，紧紧地拽住。

"So were is it," she asked again in that sweet honey voice. It sent a chill down Shinji's spine. He hoped to never piss her off enough to make her use that voice.  
“那么，它在哪儿？”她再次用那甜美如蜜的声音问道。这声音让真嗣脊背发凉。他希望永远不要惹她生气到使用这种声音的地步。

Kensuke whimpered and held up the camera.  
剑介呜咽着举起了相机。

Asuka took it without question, and took out the tape. She tossed it at Shinji who caught it rather surprised that she would let him hold it. Trying not to think about what was on it Shinji pocketed it for now.  
明日香毫不犹豫地接过相机，取出了里面的磁带。她将磁带扔给真嗣，真嗣有些惊讶她会让他拿着，尽量不去想里面是什么内容，真嗣暂时把它放进了口袋。

Asuka now looked at the two of them nastily. "Right you two know what you've done and your reward is this."  
明日香此刻恶狠狠地盯着他们俩。“你们俩知道自己干了什么，这就是你们的下场。”

She kicked both of them in the balls sending them to their knees. Shinji had to turn away so as not to here the low grunting. It was something he would rather not experience. Just watching it was bad enough.  
她一脚踢向两人的裆部，让他们跪倒在地。真嗣不得不转过头去，以免听到那低沉的呻吟。这是他宁愿不去体验的。光是看着就已经够糟糕了。

Asuka now walked over to Shinji and held out her hand. He obediently took the tape out of his pocket and handed it to her. She put it back in and walked over to the railing of the school and dropped the camera off the school roof where it fell five stories and shattered upon contact with the ground. Shinji looked over and saw that the tape had broken apart and tape reel was strewn over the ground.  
明日香走到真嗣面前，伸出手。他顺从地从口袋里拿出录像带递给她。她将录像带放回相机，走到学校的栏杆旁，将相机从屋顶扔下，五层楼的高度让它落地时摔得粉碎。真嗣望过去，看到录像带已经断裂，磁带卷散落一地。

He suddenly felt Asuka grab his arm and said, "Fuck this. I'm done with school for today. Lets go home."  
他突然感觉到明日香抓住了他的手臂，说道：“去他妈的。我今天不想上学了。我们回家吧。”

Shinji wasn't able to do anything but nod.  
真嗣除了点头什么也做不了。

---

Being back home though was boring. Asuka immediately grabbed a soda and a bag of chips and sat down to watch T.V. for the rest of the day. Shinji sat with her for a while but eventually got annoyed with trying to understand what she was watching, it was in German.  
然而回到家后却很无聊。明日香立刻抓起一罐汽水和一袋薯片，坐下来准备看一整天的电视。真嗣和她一起坐了一会儿，但最终因为试图理解她在看什么而感到烦躁，那节目是德语的。

So Shinji went to his room and flopped down on his futon and tried to take a nap, but every time he closed his eyes that unbidden image of a rotting Asuka floated into his mind again. It was starting to get on his nerves now. How was he supposed to know when to stop her from dying? Its not like he could follow her everywhere she went, and she certainly wouldn't allow it anyway  
于是真嗣回到自己的房间，扑倒在榻榻米上试图小睡一会儿，但每次他闭上眼睛，那幅不由自主的腐烂明日香影像就会再次浮现在脑海中。这已经开始让他感到烦躁了。他怎么知道何时该阻止她死去？他不可能随时随地跟着她，而且她肯定也不会允许的。

In his feigned sleep he heard somebody open the door. Knowing it was Asuka he pretended to ignore her but was unable to when she kicked him in the side.  
在他假装睡觉时，他听到有人打开了门。知道是明日香，他假装不理会，但当她踢了他侧身一脚时，他无法再装下去。

"Get up baka, were going out."  
“起来，笨蛋，我们要出去。”

Shinji rolled over and was surprised to see Asuka standing their fully dressed. She was wearing a tight, red, sleeveless shirt that failed to hide a slight cleavage, and a dark tight blue pair of jeans. Shinji also saw that she had sun glasses on her head and that she was also wearing sandals.  
真嗣翻身一看，惊讶地发现明日香已经穿戴整齐地站在那里。她穿着一件紧身的红色无袖上衣，隐约露出一点乳沟，下身是一条深蓝色的紧身牛仔裤。真嗣还注意到她头上戴着太阳镜，脚上穿着凉鞋。

"C'mon baka, Misato wanted me to take you shopping so thats what I'm gonna do. Anything is better then just sitting on the couch and getting fat. Besides I need some new clothes too so thats the only reason that I'm doing this," she added.  
“快点，笨蛋，美里让我带你去购物，所以我就得这么做。总比整天坐在沙发上发胖强。再说了，我也需要买些新衣服，这是我唯一愿意做这件事的原因。”她补充道。

Shinji was surprised but nodded and turned to the bathroom to start changing.  
真嗣虽然惊讶，但还是点了点头，转身去浴室开始换衣服。

Several minutes later Shinji came out wearing blue jeans with a white short sleeve shirt, his favorite.  
几分钟后，真嗣穿着他最喜欢的蓝色牛仔裤和白色短袖衬衫走了出来。

Asuka looked him up and down, sighed and said, 'You really have no sense of fashion do you."  
明日香上下打量了他一番，叹了口气说：“你真是毫无时尚感，对吧。”

Shinji raised and eyebrow and walked past her to put his shoes on.  
真嗣挑了挑眉毛，从她身边走过去穿鞋。

'Coward,' thought Asuka before she followed him out the door.  
'胆小鬼，' 明日香在心里想着，随后跟着他走出了门。

---

They were in a part of Tokyo-3 which Shinji had hardly ever walked in. Asuka seemed to know her way around though fairly well.  
他们来到了东京-3 的一个区域，真嗣几乎从未涉足过。但明日香似乎对这里相当熟悉。

Soon though Shinji was wishing he hadn't let her drag him out there. The first store she dragged him into was nothing women's undergarments. Shinji had a feeling that Asuka was making him nervous on purpose. While she browsed around Shinji tried not to focus on one thing to long. He was starting to sweat and he saw that several other girls were looking at him and giggling rather loudly. Either Asuka saw this or not she didn't say.  
很快，真嗣就后悔让她把自己拖到这里来了。她拉他进的第一家店就是卖女性内衣的。真嗣有种感觉，明日香是故意让他紧张的。她在店里逛来逛去，真嗣尽量不去长时间关注某一样东西。他开始出汗，注意到有几个女孩正看着他，大声地偷笑。不管明日香有没有注意到这一点，她都没有说什么。

Asuka turned around then and held up a red bra. Showing it to Shinji who was determinedly looking the other way she said, "Well, what do you think baka. I think it would go rather well with my hair, and of course I'll have to buy matching underwear to go with it."  
明日香转过身来，举起一件红色胸罩。她向坚决不看向她的真嗣展示着，说道：“好吧，你觉得怎么样，笨蛋。我觉得它和我的头发很配，当然我还得买配套的内衣来搭配它。”

"Do you want my honest opinion," said Shinji who now had his back to her.  
“你想听我的真实意见吗？”真嗣背对着她说道。

"That is why I'm asking you, baka."  
“所以我才问你，笨蛋。”

Shinji took a deep breath hoping that he wouldn't regret his words and said, "That looks like something that a stripper would wear."  
真嗣深吸了一口气，希望自己不会后悔说出这些话，然后说道：“那看起来像是脱衣舞娘会穿的。”

Asuka was rather shocked that he had the nerve to say that. Though she was also glad that for once he had spoken his mind. In truth she had showed him it just to see what he would say. She hadn't really considered buying it in the first place. Smirking at his back she said, "Yeah I guess your right."  
明日香相当震惊他居然有胆量这么说。不过她也感到高兴，因为这次他终于说出了心里话。实际上，她给他看那件衣服只是想看看他会怎么反应，并没有真的考虑要买。她对着他的背影微微一笑，说道：“是啊，我想你说的没错。”

Shinji was surprised that she actually valued his opinion. "So are we done here?"  
真嗣惊讶于她竟然真的重视他的意见。“那我们这里的事就算完了？”

"Course not. I've got something that I seriously want to look at."  
“当然不是。我有件非常想看的东西。”

Asuka now grabbed Shinji's arm and steered him over to the swimsuit part of the store. For the next half an hour Asuka sorted through many different choices asking Shinji's opinion on some of them. Shinji who thought of how she would look every time she held a pair up simply shrugged and shook his head.  
现在，明日香抓住了真嗣的手臂，把他带到商店的泳装区。接下来的半小时里，明日香翻阅了许多不同的选择，不时询问真嗣的意见。每次她拿起一件泳装时，真嗣只是耸耸肩，摇摇头，心里想着她穿上会是什么样子。

"A lot of help your being," said Asuka.  
“你可真帮不上忙，”明日香说道。

"Is this something that most guys are supposed to know about?"  
"这是大多数男生都应该知道的事情吗？"

Asuka ignored him and went to the changing room to try on what she just picked out.  
明日香没理他，径直走向更衣室去试穿她刚挑中的衣服。

Shinji was leaning against the wall when Asuka step up to him and said, "Well, what do you think."  
真嗣靠在墙上，明日香走到他面前问道：“怎么样，你觉得呢？”

Shinji had to control his hormones correctly for this one. She had just put on a two piece red bathing suit that had a white strip going along the middle of the top. Shinji blinked and turned away so that he wouldn't be starring so much.  
真嗣这次得好好控制自己的荷尔蒙。她刚穿上一件红色两件式泳衣，上衣中间有一条白色条纹。真嗣眨了眨眼，转过身去，以免盯着她看太久。

"Ah fuck you Shinji, your no help." Asuka turned around to go back in and change out of it when Shinji spoke up, "I think you should get that."  
“啊，去你的，真嗣，你一点忙都帮不上。” 明日香转身准备回去换掉泳衣，这时真嗣开口了，“我觉得你应该买这件。”

Asuka turned around to see him determinedly looking the other way. "Your just saying that so we can leave, aren't you."  
明日香转过身来，看到他坚决地看着别处。“你只是这么说，好让我们能离开，对吧。”

Shinji didn't want to let up on how good he thought it looked on her. He was unwilling starting to get stiff and didn't want her to notice. "No, I think...that the red goes well with your hair."  
真嗣不想放弃他认为这衣服在她身上很好看的想法。他开始感到僵硬，不想让她注意到。“不，我觉得……红色和你的头发很配。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him and said, "Hmph whether you think it looks good or not I was planning on buying it anyway." Asuka walked past him but paused and smirked, "By the way try not to be so noticeable next time. I can tell you were starring at my chest."  
明日香对他挑了挑眉，说道：“哼，不管你觉得好不好看，反正我本来就打算买这件。”明日香从他身边走过，但停下脚步，微微一笑，“顺便说一句，下次尽量不要这么显眼。我能看出你一直在盯着我的胸部。”

She walked past him to change into her normal clothes leaving him to gape back at her. 'Damn her,' he thought. 'She just loves to aggravate me.'  
她从他身边走过，去换上平常的衣服，留下他目瞪口呆地看着她。‘该死，’他想，‘她就喜欢惹我生气。’

---

Predictably Shinji was stuck carrying the stuff that she had picked out. Now Asuka was looking around at the shops trying to decide what place would be best to get Shinji some new clothes.  
不出所料，真嗣正扛着她挑选的东西。现在，明日香正环顾四周的商店，试图决定哪一家最适合给真嗣买些新衣服。

Shinji was getting bored though and didn't particularly care whether he got new clothes or not. It's not like anyone was going to notice a change if he did dress a little differently.  
然而，真嗣开始感到无聊，并不特别在意是否要买新衣服。就算他穿得有些不同，也不会有人注意到这种变化。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"Hmm." "嗯。"

"Lets skip this. I don't care whether I get new clothes or not."  
"跳过这个吧。我不在乎是否得到新衣服。"

"Misato ordered me to get you some, so I don't have a choice."  
"美里让我给你买一些，所以我别无选择。"

"But I'm saying that I don't care. It was bad enough being stuck in that...last store."  
"但我的意思是，我不在乎。被困在那个...上一家店里已经够糟糕的了。"

Asuka turned to him now and a grin appeared on her face. "Good because I wasn't taking this seriously anyway. I just wanted you with me so that I didn't have to carry my bags. Though make sure you tell Misato that I took you but you changed your mind. I don't want to get chewed out by her."  
明日香转过身来，脸上露出了笑容。"太好了，反正我也没认真对待。我只是想让你陪我，这样我就不用自己拎包了。不过记得告诉美里是我带你去的，但你改变了主意。我不想被她骂。"

"Hai, I will." "好的，我会说的。"

"Good, then lets go home. My feet are getting sore from all this walking anyway."  
“好，那我们回家吧。我的脚已经走得酸痛了。”

---

Soon the sun had started to set and rush hour was just starting. Shinji was walking a few paces behind Asuka and for some reason couldn't shake a worried feeling that he had all the sudden. 'What is this,' he thought as he looked around at the traffic rushing by him. 'Why do I have a sickening feeling as though something is going to happ-'  
不久，太阳开始西沉，高峰时段刚刚开始。真嗣跟在明日香后面几步远，不知为何突然感到一阵莫名的担忧。'这是怎么了，'他环顾四周疾驰而过的车流，心中思索，'为什么我会突然有种不祥的预感，仿佛即将发生什么——'

---

Shinji felt reality slip away from him. He was now above the street that he had just been walking on and looking down at the cars and pedestrians walking along. 'Why does this seem so...familiar? I don't think I've ever been to this side of Tokyo-3 before. Yet I can't shake this feeling that something is going to happen.'  
真嗣感到现实从他身边滑走。他现在正悬浮在刚刚走过的街道上方，俯视着下方的车辆和行人。'为什么这一切看起来如此……熟悉？我不记得曾来过第三新东京市的这一带。然而，我无法摆脱那种即将发生什么的感觉。'

At his thoughts he saw somebody stumble into the road. Next second the person was hit in the side from an oncoming truck and was dragged under. Even though Shinji couldn't see what was happening from his vantage point he could see that it was a gruesome scene. The person had been spit back out from under the truck and was now lying helpless in the road. Blood was seeping out onto the road where the person laid and Shinji could see unmistakable signs of body tissue. Even though he told himself it was all a dream he still felt like puking.  
他正想着，突然看到有人踉跄地闯入马路。下一秒，那人被迎面而来的卡车侧面撞击，拖入了车底。尽管真嗣从他的位置无法看清发生了什么，但他能看出那是一幕惨状。那人被卡车甩了出来，现在无助地躺在路上。血从那人躺着的地方渗出，真嗣能清楚地看到人体组织的痕迹。尽管他告诉自己这一切都是梦，他仍然感到想吐。

"Do you see what has happened," said a quite voice behind him.  
“你看到了发生的事，”一个平静的声音在他身后说道。

He turned around in mid air to see the Asuka from his dreams. Even though she was still missing half her face she was at least standing up now and not laying in a pool of her own blood.  
他在半空中转过身，看到了梦中的那个明日香。尽管她仍缺了半张脸，但至少现在站起来了，不再躺在自己的血泊中。

"What are you doing here," Shinji asked?  
"你在这里做什么？" 真嗣问道。

"Simple, watching what just occurred."  
"简单，观察刚刚发生的事情。"

"What do you mea-" "你是什么意——"

Next second Shinji found himself next to the body of the person who had just been dragged under the car. Shinji now felt his lungs collapse inside of him. Asuka was lying face up on the pavement with a blank, dead look in her eyes. Just like the one standing next to him this one had the side of her face torn off and an eye ball was hanging loosely over the side. Shinji now guessed what had happened to her fingers and saw that the skin had been shredded off thanks to the tires of the car.  
下一秒，真嗣发现自己站在刚刚被拖到车下的人旁边。真嗣此刻感到自己的肺仿佛在体内崩塌。明日香仰面躺在人行道上，眼中毫无生气，死寂一片。就像站在他身边的这个一样，她的半边脸被撕裂，眼球松松地挂在一边。真嗣现在猜到了她的手指发生了什么，看到皮肤被车轮撕碎。

Shinji continued to stare back into the eyes of the now dead Asuka. It was amazing how red her hair was now with half her skull missing. Shinji now saw that his physical self had rushed over, horror struck and was now weeping over her lifeless body.  
真嗣继续凝视着已经死去的明日香的双眼。她的头发在失去半个头骨后依然红得惊人。真嗣看到自己的身体冲了过来，惊恐万分，现在正对着她毫无生气的身体哭泣。

"Is this what you want," asked the Asuka next to him.  
“这就是你想要的吗？”他身边的明日香问道。

Shinji turned with a saddened look on his face. Looking back down at the corpse before him and said, "This is what will happen if I don't save her."  
真嗣转过身来，脸上带着悲伤的表情。他再次低头看着眼前的尸体，说道：“如果我不救她，这就是将会发生的事。”

The Asuka next to him nodded.  
他身边的明日香点了点头。

Shinji felt like he was about to break down from the sheer stress of what was happening to him. "What are these...these, visions? Why is this happening to me of all people?"  
真嗣感到自己快要被这突如其来的压力击垮了。“这些……这些，幻象是什么？为什么偏偏是我要经历这些？”

"I can't answer that," said Asuka. "I'm merely here to help you along in the beginning. What you decide to do afterward is your decision. Though I will say this. Your decision affects the lives of people around you. Whether this is a gift or a curse is entirely up to you. You can simply ignore what can happen, or what will happen."  
"我无法回答这个问题，" 明日香说，"我只是在这里帮助你起步。之后你决定做什么，是你自己的选择。不过我要提醒你，你的决定会影响到你周围人的生活。这是福是祸，全在于你。你可以选择忽视可能发生或将会发生的事情。"

"Are you suggesting that I'm able to see the future."  
"你是说我有预见未来的能力吗？"

"That seems to be the case. I don't know much about it myself. Though it seems that you are able to see the future of people who are close to you. You can't look into any random person's future and alter it to your desire."  
"看起来似乎是这样。我自己对此了解不多。不过似乎你能预见到与你亲近之人的未来。你无法随意窥探任何人的未来并按你的意愿改变它。"

Shinji was silent for a while before he sat down on the curb. Putting his hand up to his face he touched it gently and then lowered it to the now dead Asuka. "Is this what can happen or what will happen if I don't stop it."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后坐在路缘上。他把手举到脸上，轻轻触碰，随后放到了已经死去的明日香身上。“这是可能发生的事，还是如果我不阻止就会发生的事。”

"Altering the future can be both dangerous for the person altering it and the person that is being altered by it. It is entirely up to you whether you do it or not."  
“改变未来对改变者和被改变者都可能很危险。是否这么做完全取决于你。”

"What is your suggestion?"  
“你有什么建议？”

"It doesn't matter to me either way. I have already died thanks to you. But it was planned that way also. This is simply an alternate reality that in which you chose to ignore the visions and continue on with your life. I'll admit that the end result wasn't pretty. You blamed yourself for killing me and in turn killed yourself. Humans can be rather pathetic."  
"对我来说都无所谓。我已经因为你而死了。但这也在计划之中。这只是你选择忽视预知并继续生活的另一个现实。我得承认，结果并不美好。你因害死我而自责，最终也自杀了。人类有时真是可悲。"

Shinji now looked up at the Asuka before him and frowned, "Who are you really."  
真嗣抬头看着眼前的明日香，皱起眉头，"你到底是谁。"

"Hmm well your not as dumb as you look. No I'm not Asuka. I'm simply taking her form so its easier to speak with you. She will have gone on by now."  
"嗯，看来你没看起来那么笨。不，我不是明日香。我只是借用她的形象，这样和你交流更方便。她现在已经离开了。"

Shinji frowned. He had so many things that he wanted to ask this pseudo Asuka but thought it was time to return to his own place.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。他有太多问题想问这个假明日香，但觉得是时候回到自己的地方了。

"How do I get back."  
“我怎么回去？”

The fake Asuka smirked and said, "However you want to."  
假明日香轻蔑地笑了笑，说：“随你高兴。”

---

All this happened in the span of seconds and Shinji continued to walk behind Asuka. 'That was interesting, though I'll save my worries later I need to decide what I want to do.' Though did he really have to think about that. Sure Asuka could be a complete pain to be around when she was in a bitchy mood. But Shinji still liked to be around her. 'I feel so stupid about having second thoughts about this, fuck I'm a coward.'  
这一切在几秒钟内发生，真嗣继续跟在明日香后面走着。'虽然那很有趣，但我还是把担忧留到以后吧，我需要决定自己想做什么。' 不过，他真的需要考虑这个吗？当然，明日香在心情不好时可能会完全是个麻烦。但真嗣仍然喜欢和她在一起。'我对这个有疑虑感到很愚蠢，该死，我真是个懦夫。'

"Hey Shinji come on lets cross here."  
嘿，真嗣，快点，我们在这里过马路吧。

Shinji looked around at where she was pointing. She was pointing to the other side of the street.  
真嗣环顾四周，看向她指的地方。她指的是街的另一边。

"C'mon baka Shinji if we cross here we can skip the next intersection. Besides," she said looking up and down the road, "their aren't any cars coming so this is the perfect chance."  
"来吧，笨蛋真嗣，如果我们从这里穿过去，就可以跳过下一个路口。而且，" 她上下打量着马路，"没有车过来，这是绝佳的机会。"

"Asuka, wait we shouldn't jaywalk."  
"明日香，等等，我们不应该乱穿马路。"

"Oh calm yourself. Your acting like the First Child." Asuka took a step off the curve and down onto the pavement. However the top of her sandal caught the edge of the curve and she stumbled forward before falling down to her knees. She was now in the lane of traffic closest to the curve.  
"哦，冷静点。你表现得像个第一适格者似的。" 明日香迈出一步，从路缘石上踏到人行道上。然而，她的凉鞋顶部勾住了路缘石的边缘，她踉跄着向前扑倒，双膝着地。她现在位于离路缘石最近的行车道上。

"FUCK, NO ASUKA," Shinji screamed.  
"操，不，明日香，" 真嗣尖叫道。

To Shinji's right he heard the roar of an engine. Turning around for a split second he saw a bright blue truck come skidding around the corner of the side street and pull onto the main street.  
在真嗣的右边，他听到了引擎的轰鸣声。转过身来的一瞬间，他看到一辆亮蓝色的卡车从侧街的拐角处滑行过来，驶上了主街。

'GOD FUCKING DAMNIT,' screamed Shinji in his head.  
'该死的，' 真嗣在心里咆哮。

Darting off the sidewalk with the eyes of every bystander on him he dove to Asuka as the truck was getting closer.  
他从人行道上疾驰而出，所有旁观者的目光都集中在他身上，他向着越来越近的卡车冲向明日香。

"ASUKA GOD DAMNIT GET UP," yelled Shinji at her as he grabbed her arm. Asuka however had frozen when she saw the truck, engine blaring, coming to great her.  
“明日香，该死的快起来！”真嗣朝她大喊，抓住她的手臂。然而明日香在看到那辆引擎轰鸣、疾驰而来的卡车时，整个人都僵住了。

"FUCK IT," yelled Shinji. Grabbing her arm he pulled her as hard as he could and practically picked her up, holding onto one of her arms. Summoning strength that he didn't know he had he jumped from the middle of the lane and landed haphazardly onto the edge of the curve. He heard the truck whiz by but knew that if he fell backwards with him holding her the way he was she could likely suffer a serious concussion, or worse.  
“去他的！”真嗣大喊一声，紧紧抓住她的手臂，用尽全力将她拉起，几乎是将她拎了起来，只靠一只手臂支撑。他爆发出自己都不知道的力量，从车道中央一跃而起，狼狈地落在弯道边缘。他听到卡车呼啸而过，但知道如果自己向后倒下，以他现在的姿势抱着她，她很可能会遭受严重的脑震荡，甚至更糟。

Instead he forced himself to lean forward and felt his foot slip off the edge of the side walk and crashed down hard on the side of his face. Almost immediately he heard a low thump as Asuka fell on top of him also.  
相反，他强迫自己向前倾，感觉到脚从人行道边缘滑落，重重地摔在了脸颊一侧。几乎立刻，他就听到一声低沉的撞击声，因为明日香也倒在了他身上。

Shinji felt blood building up inside of his mouth but ignored it. He had something else he had to worry about. Pushing himself up he found Asuka shaking uncontrollably on his chest.  
真嗣感觉到嘴里积聚着血，但他忽略了它。他有其他需要担心的事情。他撑起自己，发现明日香在他胸前颤抖不已。

"Asuka are you-" “明日香，你还好吗-”

But then he was lost for words as she broke down crying on his chest. Mouth wide open in surprise Shinji didn't know what to say in a situation like this. "Asuka," he swallowed, "its okay, everything is fine."  
但随后他便语塞了，因为她在他胸前崩溃大哭。真嗣惊讶得嘴巴大张，不知在这种情况下该说什么。“明日香，”他咽了咽口水，“没事的，一切都好。”

She shook her head and continued to cry even harder. Shinji now looked up and saw many worried faces looking back at him and her.  
她摇了摇头，哭得更厉害了。真嗣抬头望去，看到许多担忧的面孔正回望着他和她。

"Good God that was a fright, are you okay kid," said an elderly gentlemen.  
“天哪，真是吓人一跳，你还好吗，孩子？”一位老先生说道。

Shinji nodded and looked back at Asuka who he realized now had pushed herself off his chest and was starring wide eyed at everyone gathered their.  
真嗣点点头，回头看向明日香，他这时才意识到她已经从他胸前推开，正瞪大眼睛看着聚集在那里的每个人。

"No...no...," she whispered.  
“不……不……”她低声呢喃。

Shinji was worried, "Asuka what are you?" But then he froze when she screamed out loud.  
真嗣担心地问：“明日香，你怎么了？”但随即他僵住了，因为她大声尖叫起来。

"ASUKA!" "明日香！"

She had stood up quickly and had taken off down the sidewalk.  
她迅速站起身，沿着人行道飞奔而去。

"ASUKA WAIT." "明日香，等等。"

Asuka however continued to sprint as fast as she could. 'No...No...NO! I've been poisoned. I let people see my weakness. I can't let them know how weak I truly am. Least of all Shinji. How could I have used him as a sponge to cry my eyes out. I feel dirty. WHY AM I STILL ALIVE.'  
然而，明日香依旧竭尽全力地奔跑着。'不...不...不！我中毒了。我让人看到了我的弱点。我不能让他们知道我有多么脆弱。尤其是真嗣。我怎么能把他当作擦泪的海绵呢。我感觉肮脏。为什么我还活着？'

'Because he saved you,' said a small voice in her head.  
'因为他救了你，'她脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'I didn't ask him to,' she retorted.  
'我没让他这么做，'她反驳道。

'Yet he did anyway.' '但他还是这么做了。'

'NO I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. I DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE.'  
'不，我能照顾好自己。我不需要任何人。'

'Could you have saved yourself if you weren't so afraid.'  
'如果不是因为害怕，你能自救吗？'

'I would rather die then rely on anybody. Least of all that coward.'  
'我宁愿死也不愿依赖任何人。尤其是那个懦夫。'

'Yet he wasn't a coward. He risked his own life to save you.'  
'但他并非懦夫。他冒着生命危险来救你。'

'STOP IT. GET OUT OF MY MIND.'  
'住口。从我脑海中滚出去。'

---

Soon Shinji had lost sight of Asuka and was leaning against a light post breath heavily. While he had ran he discovered that several teeth had been knocked loose and that they were hanging by little more than his gums. The blood was still flowing freely in his mouth and he had to spit every few seconds to keeping the saltiness out of his mouth.  
不久，真嗣便看不见明日香的身影了，他靠在一根路灯杆上，喘着粗气。在奔跑的过程中，他发现自己有几颗牙齿松动了，几乎只是靠牙龈勉强挂着。血仍在嘴里自由流淌，他不得不每隔几秒就吐一口，以保持嘴里没有咸味。

'Damn it Asuka. Why were you so afraid all the sudden?'  
“该死的明日香。你为什么突然这么害怕？”

Shinji soon willed himself to move off of the light post and continued running back to Misato's apartment where he was sure Asuka had gone.  
真嗣很快强迫自己离开路灯杆，继续跑回美里小姐的公寓，他确信明日香已经去了那里。

---

When Shinji opened the door he was glad to notice that her shoes were at least laying there. Though it looked as though she had thrown them across the floor when she had come in.  
当真嗣打开门时，他很高兴至少看到她的鞋子摆在那里。不过看起来她进来时像是把它们扔过地板似的。

He took his own shoes off and walked slowly inside. "Asuka," he said quietly.  
他脱下自己的鞋子，慢慢地走了进去。“明日香，”他轻声说道。

He didn't get a response back and walked inside a little further. Turning toward her door he knocked softly. "Asuka...are you there."  
他没有得到回应，又往里走了几步。转向她的房门，他轻轻地敲了敲。“明日香...你在吗？”

Again he didn't get an answer. Feeling a little worried he opened the door a little and peeked his head in. "Asuka?"  
他又没有得到回答。感到有些担心，他轻轻推开门，探头进去。“明日香？”

He was greeted with something being thrown at him. Though it missed his head it shattered close to it and Shinji felt something sharp scrape the side of his face. He pulled back his head quickly and shut the door as something else shattered against it. 'Damn, why the fuck is she acting like this. I just saved her life didn't I. She could at least show a little gratitude.'  
迎接他的是一个飞来的物体。虽然没砸中他的头，却在附近碎裂，真嗣感到脸颊一侧被什么尖锐的东西划过。他迅速缩回头，关上门，又有什么东西在门上碎裂。“该死，她到底为什么这样发疯。我不是救了她一命吗？她至少可以表现出一点感激之情吧。”

Shinji now walked away but stop dead in his tracks when a fleeting image of Asuka choking herself with some twine appeared in his mind.  
真嗣转身离开，但突然停下脚步，脑海中闪过明日香用细绳勒住自己脖子的画面。

"Its your fault Shinji, I can't let anyone know how weak I am. Least of all you."  
"这都是你的错，真嗣，我不能让任何人知道我有多脆弱。尤其是你。"

Without thinking he turned around and flung open the door to her room. Ignoring the fact that something else was aimed at his head he darted toward where she was, curled up in a corner with something that looked like a stuffed bear in her hands.  
他未经思考便转过身，猛地推开她房间的门。无视着有东西正瞄准他的头部，他冲向她所在的地方，只见她蜷缩在角落里，手里抱着一个看起来像毛绒熊的东西。

"NO DON'T COME NEAR ME," she shrieked as she tried to push herself farther back into the corner  
"不，不要靠近我，""她尖叫着，试图将自己更深地挤进角落里。

Shinji ignored her and looked at her carefully, then swore in his mind. He remembered what the fake Asuka had said about not relying to much on the visions. Sometimes they were only things that could happen, not things that would happen. Relaxing slightly he let out a deep breath and looked at her more closely. It seemed that she had gotten back slightly ahead of him. Her hair was a greasy mess from her sweat and it hung in great bunches around her face. She still had the red shirt and dark blue jeans on, though he saw that certain parts had stains on them.  
真嗣无视了她，仔细地打量着她，然后在心里咒骂了一声。他想起了假明日香关于不要太依赖幻象的忠告。有时候，那些只是可能发生的事情，而不是一定会发生的。他稍微放松了一些，深吸一口气，更仔细地看着她。似乎她已经稍微领先于他了。她的头发因为汗水而变得油腻凌乱，大团地垂在脸颊周围。她仍然穿着那件红色衬衫和深蓝色牛仔裤，尽管他注意到某些部分有污渍。

She still seemed nervous and had an afraid look in her eyes. Shinji wanted to calm her down, to prevent himself from seeing any more horrendous images appearing in his mind. Instead he sat down a few feet in front of her. This was the first time that he had been in her room and he looked around now at it. It was much cleaner than his and he saw that many of the things that she had came from Germany. She had hung several posters on her walls depicting famous artists. Shinji didn't recognized any of them though, he was more into the classics.  
她看起来仍然很紧张，眼中流露出害怕的神情。真嗣想让她平静下来，以免脑海中再出现更多可怕的画面。相反，他在她面前几英尺处坐下。这是他第一次进入她的房间，他现在环顾四周。这里比他的房间干净得多，他看到她的许多东西都来自德国。她在墙上挂了几张著名艺术家的海报。真嗣一个也不认识，他更喜欢古典艺术。

Turning his gaze back to her he saw that she had calmed down slightly but was now giving him a death glare. Truthfully Shinji preferred the hard ass Asuka instead of the frightened one. It didn't suit her.  
他转回视线看向她，发现她已经稍微平静了一些，但此刻正对他投以死亡凝视。说实话，真嗣更喜欢那个强硬的明日香，而不是那个惊慌失措的她。那不适合她。

Feeling that she was doing better he said quietly, "Asuka...are you okay?"  
感觉到她状态有所好转，他轻声问道：“明日香……你还好吗？”

She inhaled deeply and grabbed the nearest pillow and flung it at Shinji's face. Shinji didn't even care. The fact that she had reacted was all that he cared for. "Asuk-"  
她深吸一口气，抓起最近的枕头朝真嗣的脸扔去。真嗣根本不在意。她有所反应的事实才是他在乎的。“明日香——”

But now she tackled him to the floor and was now beating her fists repeatedly on his chest. "Damn you Shinji. Damn you, damn you damn you."  
但她此刻却将他扑倒在地，拳头如雨点般落在他的胸膛。“该死的真嗣。该死的，该死的该死的。”

Shinji continued to look up at her ceiling while she continued to pound his chest. Soon the punches became less frequent and with less power. Then she had seised hitting him and had pushed herself off of him and moved back to the corner.  
真嗣继续仰望着天花板，而她依旧捶打着他的胸口。渐渐地，拳击的频率和力度都减弱了。随后，她停止了击打，从他身上撑起，退回到角落里。

Shinji continue to stare at the wall waiting for her to reply. "Why did you do that?"  
真嗣继续盯着墙壁，等待她的回应。“你为什么要那样做？”

Shinji thought this was the stupidest question in the world. What was he supposed to, just stand there in shock as she died? He didn't think he could take seeing her die for a second time.  
真嗣觉得这是世界上最愚蠢的问题。难道他应该怎么做，就站在那里震惊地看着她死去吗？他觉得他无法承受再次目睹她死去。

"Do you honestly think that I could have watched that happen."  
"你真的认为我能眼睁睁看着那种事情发生吗。"

"But...I always seem to get on your nerves. Why would you risk yourself to protect someone like me?"  
"但是...我总是惹你生气。你为什么要冒着生命危险去保护像我这样的人呢？"

Shinji wasn't about to tell her about his visions. He didn't need her thinking that he was some sort of freak. "Do I need a reason. If I was to stand their and watch it would have been the same as killing you myself. I was able to save you and I took that."  
真嗣并不打算告诉她自己的那些幻觉。他不需要她认为自己是个怪胎。“我需要理由吗？如果我站在那里看着，那和亲手杀了你有什么区别。我救了你，我抓住了那个机会。”

"But I didn't want you to," she almost yelled. "I feel so disgusting...like vomiting. I was held by you GOD DAMNIT. I CRIED INTO YOUR CHEST. I WAS WEAK!"  
“但我并不想让你救我，”她几乎是在喊。“我感觉恶心……想吐。我被你抱住了，该死的。我哭着靠在你胸前。我太软弱了！”

"Is that what this is about? You felt weak. Asuka your one of the strongest people I know. Being able to pilot something like the Eva's is an inhuman task. When I piloted it...for that time, I felt like I was losing my mind. It was so disgusting floating in that damn liquid that smells so much like blood. I kept willing myself not to vomit every time I felt the bile coming up my throat. And you've been doing this full time, how could you call yourself weak. If anything I'm the weak one."  
“这就是问题的关键吗？你觉得软弱。明日香，你是我认识的最坚强的人之一。驾驶像 Eva 这样的东西是非人的任务。当我驾驶它……那段时间，我感觉自己快要疯了。漂浮在那股血腥味浓重的液体里，太恶心了。每次感到胆汁涌上喉咙，我都拼命忍住不吐。而你一直在全职做这件事，你怎么能说自己软弱呢。要说的话，我才是不够坚强的人。”

Asuka was silent. Shinji hadn't talked about his experience inside the Eva since he had been released from the hospital. It was always something that she and Misato knew that he would never talk about freely. "Shinji...do you plan on ever piloting Eva again."  
明日香沉默了。真嗣自从出院后，就再也没有谈及他在 Eva 中的经历。她和美里都知道，他永远不会自由地谈论这些。“真嗣……你打算再次驾驶 Eva 吗？”

Shinji didn't even have to think of that. "No, I can't, not for anything. I don't want to put myself in something as...demonic I guess, ever again."  
真嗣甚至不需要思考这个问题。“不，我做不到，无论如何都不行。我不想再让自己陷入那种……可以说是恶魔般的存在中了。”

"But the Eva's are supposed to be used to save mankind from the Angels."  
“但 Eva 本应被用来拯救人类免受使徒的威胁。”

"Yet what are the Angels. Why do they attack us? What have we done wrong."  
“然而天使是什么？他们为何攻击我们？我们做错了什么？”

Asuka was silent. It was something she never worried about. Though now that he brought it up she wondered also what the purpose of them could be. She knew about the possibilities of Third Impact and that the Angels were trying to initiate it.  
明日香沉默了。这是她从未担心过的问题。不过现在他提起了，她也想知道天使存在的目的。她知道第三次冲击的可能性，以及天使们试图引发它。

Now though she saw that Shinji had moved closer to her and was bending over her legs. Immediately she became defensive and said, "What the fuck are you doing. You better not being try to take a peek up my pant legs, because if you are I'l-"  
然而现在，她看到真嗣向她靠近，弯腰在她腿边。她立刻变得警觉，说道：“你在干什么？你最好不要试图偷看我的裙底，否则我可要——”

"Oh shut it Asuka," said Shinji forcefully.  
"哦，闭嘴吧，明日香，" 真嗣强硬地说道。

Asuka did, though it was because of her surprise. She had hardly heard Shinji snap back at her. Now though she asked in a more polite voice, "What are you doing then baka?"  
明日香确实闭嘴了，但这只是因为她感到惊讶。她几乎没听过真嗣对她反唇相讥。不过现在她用更礼貌的语气问道，"那你到底在干什么，笨蛋？"

"You probably never realized it, but when you fell you scraped your knees." Shinji was looking at her pant legs now and saw that where the knees were was a little damp.  
"你可能从未注意到，但你摔倒时擦伤了膝盖。" 真嗣现在正盯着她的裤腿看，发现膝盖处有点潮湿。

"Asuka can I have you roll up your pant legs to your knees?"  
“明日香，你能把裤腿卷到膝盖上吗？”

She threw him a scowl but complied. "You better not try anything suspicious are you'll be on your stomach gasping for air."  
她瞪了他一眼，但还是照做了。“你最好别动什么歪脑筋，否则你就得趴在地上喘不过气来。”

Shinji ignored her comment and looked down at her knees. The blood had dried in certain areas but was still flowing slightly. "We'll have to staunch this and wrap it up with something."  
真嗣没理会她的警告，低头看着她的膝盖。血在一些地方已经凝固，但仍有轻微流出。“我们得先止血，然后用东西包扎一下。”

"Don't you mean I," said Asuka standing up. "I'm not letting you touch me anymore than you have to hentai."  
"你是指'我'吧，" 明日香站起来说道。"我不会让你再碰我，除非必要，变态。"

Shinji scowled at her but sighed and stood up. "Fine do what ever you want. But clean that soon or it could get infected. Misato might not be coming back for a while so I'm gonna start dinner now."  
真嗣对她皱了皱眉，但还是叹了口气站起来。"好吧，随你便。但尽快清理干净，不然可能会感染。美里可能一时半会儿回不来，我要开始做晚饭了。"

"Fine do whatever you want."  
"好吧，随你便。"

Asuka turned and walked out into the hallway and turned into the bathroom. Poking her head back out she said with a slight grin on her face, "And don't you dare try to catch anything."  
明日香转过身，走出走廊，拐进了浴室。她探出头来，脸上带着一丝狡黠的笑容说：“你可别想抓住什么。”

"As if I would," said Shinji.  
“我才不会呢，”真嗣说。

---

Shinji was standing over the stove now with the pot that was sending steam out. He didn't care what Asuka said, he wanted something Japanese for once instead of constant German food. 'As long as she doesn't have to cook she doesn't care anyway. But really, through all the talking we just did she never thanked me once. Maybe she doesn't have a heart maybe its just a black hole of some sorts.'  
真嗣现在站在炉子旁，锅里的蒸汽不断冒出。他不在乎明日香说什么，他只想吃一次日本料理，而不是一直吃德国菜。‘只要她不用做饭，她才不在乎呢。但说真的，我们刚才聊了那么多，她一次也没谢过我。也许她没有心，也许那只是某种黑洞。’

Shinji now turned off the stove and took the pot with the cooked rice in it. Putting the rice in together with the beef and vegetables he tossed the food together so that the peanut oil he had used mixed with the rice so that it gave it a little more flavor. Stir fry's were some of Shinji's favorite meals.  
真嗣现在关掉了炉子，拿起装着煮熟米饭的锅。他将米饭与牛肉和蔬菜一起翻炒，让之前使用的花生油与米饭混合，增添了一丝风味。炒饭是真嗣最喜欢的菜肴之一。

"Smells like something that isn't Japanese food," said a voice behind.  
“闻起来不像日本料理，”背后传来一个声音。

'Wonder who the hell that could be,' thought Shinji in mock irritation.  
“不知道那会是谁，”真嗣假装恼怒地想。

"Sorry Asuka, I wanted Japanese food today."  
"对不起，明日香，我今天想吃日本料理。"

"Whatever, since it smells good enough I don't care."  
"无所谓，既然闻起来不错，我就不介意了。"

'Figures, she didn't cook it so she doesn't care. Sometimes I wonder how the hell she survived without me there to cook for her.'  
“难怪，她没做所以不在乎。有时候我真好奇，没有我在那儿给她做饭，她是怎么活下来的。”

Turning around Shinji put the pot with everything in it on the table and put two plates on the table.  
转过身，真嗣将装满食材的锅放在桌上，并摆上了两个盘子。

"Itadakimasu," said Shinji.  
“我开动了，”真嗣说道。

Asuka simply dug right in to the food without saying any form of thank you. Shinji sighed and figured he should have been expecting this attitude.  
明日香直接开始吃起了食物，没有说任何感谢的话。真嗣叹了口气，心想自己本该料到她会是这种态度。

"What is this," said Asuka speaking up?  
"这是什么？" 明日香开口问道。

"Its a stir fry," said Shinji.  
"这是一道炒菜，" 真嗣回答道。

"Hmm, its not half bad baka."  
"嗯，还不赖，笨蛋。"

"Err, thanks Asuka." "呃，谢谢明日香。"

Asuka now looked up from her plate and put down her chopsticks.  
明日香现在从她的盘子上抬起头，放下了筷子。

"Um Shinji..." "嗯，真嗣..."

"What?" "什么？"

"I guess...well...thank you..."  
"我想...嗯...谢谢你..."

Shinji continued to look down at his plate. "...Don't mention it."  
真嗣继续低头看着他的盘子。"...不用谢。"

"You...wont mention...that to Misato will you?"  
"你...不会把...这件事告诉美里吧？"

Shinji looked up and saw that she was really worried. 'Why would she be so worried about something so trivial as that. Even me who practically shunned all human contact eventually came to realize that being around people is enjoyable and thats its okay to rely on people to help. But if she doesn't want help thats her choice. I'm not gonna force her to acknowledge anything.'  
真嗣抬头一看，发现她真的很担心。'为什么她会对这么琐碎的事情如此担心呢。就连我这个几乎回避所有人际交往的人，最终也意识到与人相处是愉快的，依靠他人帮助也是没问题的。但如果她不想接受帮助，那是她的选择。我不会强迫她承认任何事情。'

"Yeah, don't worry about it."  
“嗯，别担心。”

Asuka nodded and went back to eating  
明日香点点头，继续吃东西

Later that night Shinji lay awake in bed. Everything had happened to him today was spinning around in his head. "Why do I have this...power I guess you could call it, to see the future of people I know. Is their a reason that I've been given this. What am I supposed to do with this."  
那晚晚些时候，真嗣躺在床上辗转反侧。今天发生的一切在他脑海中盘旋。“为什么我会有这种……可以说是预知未来的能力，看到我所认识的人的未来。这是有什么原因吗？我应该用这个能力做什么。”

"You've got to find that out for yourself baka."  
“你得自己找出答案，笨蛋。”

Shinji sat bolt upright and almost screamed out. The fake Asuka was sitting on the edge of his bed smirking at him. Though Shinji was glad that she seemed to have her face back to the way it was.  
真嗣猛地坐起身，差点尖叫出来。假明日香坐在他床边，正对他冷笑。尽管真嗣很高兴她的脸似乎恢复了原样。

"Err I don't mean to be rude but what are you doing here...do I still call you Asuka or what."  
"呃，我不是有意无礼，但你在这里做什么...我还该叫你明日香吗？"

"You can, though...nah you can wait a little longer. I see that you decided to save her."  
"你可以，不过...算了，你再等一会儿吧。看来你决定救她了。"

"I don't think I couldn't have. I...hmm...it wouldn't have been right."  
"我觉得我不能不救。我...嗯...那样做不对。"

"Thats a rather lame excuse."  
"那真是个蹩脚的借口。"

"Maybe but I can't think of a better one. Just knowing that it would have been my fault would have been enough to drive me mad."  
"或许吧，但我实在想不出更好的理由。光是知道那可能是我的错，就足以让我发疯。"

"You've still got a long way's to go," said the fake Asuka standing up.  
""你还有很长的路要走，""假明日香站起身来说道。

Shinji smirked and said, "You may look like her, and I hate to say it but right down to her chest, but Asuka never would sound so philosophical."  
真嗣微微一笑，说道：“你或许外表像她，甚至胸部都一模一样，但我不得不说，明日香从不会这么哲学。”

"Maybe not, but I only know what she looks like. I haven't been around her enough to know what kind of personality she has. Though I can certainly examine your mind to find out. Would like me to?"  
“也许吧，但我只知道她的样子。我还没和她相处足够久，不了解她的性格。不过，我当然可以探查你的心思来了解。你想让我这么做吗？”

Shinji smiled, "No thats okay. Having one Asuka is enough."  
真嗣笑了笑，“不用了，有这一个明日香就够了。”

"Thats rather rude." "那样说有点不礼貌。"

"No I mean...she's unique, I guess thats the best way I can phrase that."  
"不，我是说……她很独特，我想这是我能想到的最恰当的表述了。"

"Hmph I guess, I can understand that. Well, I'm done here. Time to see what other misfortunate humans I can torture. Though I must say your decision is rather interesting."  
"哼，我想我能理解。好了，我这里结束了。该去看看还有哪些不幸的人类可以折磨了。不过我得说，你的决定相当有趣。"

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

She simply smirked and said, "Oh you'll find out soon enough."  
她只是微微一笑，说道：“哦，你很快就会知道了。”

He blinked and she was gone which left him to wonder if it was nothing more than a dream or if he had really just talked to...whoever she was.  
他眨了眨眼，她已消失无踪，留下他独自疑惑，这究竟是一场梦，还是他真的与那位——无论她是谁——交谈过。

### Chapter 4: Decide

**...I'M BACk..for now. Sorry bout the wait. In my defense I'll say that its hard to right a story like this and I have to be in a particular mood to get everything across. Anyway I'm hoping to work on this more so expect updates more frequently. (instead of four month's like this time) So for all those people that thought I died or abandoned this I apologize. I never abandon my stories, no matter how long it takes to get them done, I will get them done. And...I'm done  
……我回来了……暂时。抱歉让大家久等了。我得辩解一下，写这样的故事确实很难，我必须得在特定的心情下才能把一切都表达出来。无论如何，我希望今后能更频繁地更新（不像这次隔了四个月）。所以，对于那些以为我死了或者放弃了这个故事的人，我深表歉意。我从不放弃我的故事，无论需要多长时间完成，我都会完成它们。而且……我说完了。**

---

Shinji sat bolt upright on his futon, breathing heavily as though he had just ran a mile. Rubbing his temples wearily he let out a low sigh and tried to remember what he had just dreamt.  
真嗣笔直地坐在他的被褥上，呼吸急促，仿佛刚跑完一英里。他疲惫地揉着太阳穴，发出一声低叹，试图回忆起他刚刚梦见了什么。

Again, he suspected, that it had to do with the random visions that he had been having. Most of them, with the exception of Asuka's, had been completely irrelevant. This one though confused him.  
他再次怀疑，这与他近期频繁出现的幻觉有关。除了关于明日香的那些，大多数幻觉都毫无关联。但这次的幻觉却让他困惑不已。

In it, he was standing in the middle of a large crater, in the center of Tokyo 3. Around him many corpses of people that he had no affiliation with. However in the middle of it all was Eva Unit 01.  
在幻觉中，他站在一个巨大的弹坑中央，位于第三新东京市的中心。周围散布着许多与他无关的人的尸体。然而，在这片混乱的中心，是 Eva 初号机。

Shinji had stood there for a good while before he walked slowly over to what remained of the unit. The entry plug was laying a good few yards away from it and as he slowly approached it he realized that an arm was dangling out of it. Now running towards, it he pried it open as best he could. From what he could see from the small opening that he had made a girl laid inside.  
真嗣在那里站了好一会儿，才慢慢走向残存的初号机。驾驶舱插栓躺在离它几码远的地方，当他缓缓靠近时，他发现有一只手臂从里面垂挂出来。他立刻跑向那里，尽可能地用力打开插栓。从他打开的小缝隙中，他看到一个女孩躺在里面。

At this point Shinji felt nauseous, not necessarily from the fact that another child was forced to fight in the demonic Eva's, but more of the fact that her left side was torn apart, leaving brain matter hanging out of the side of her skull. From what he could see, apart from all the blood, was that she had light blue hair.  
此时，真嗣感到一阵恶心，并非完全因为另一个孩子被迫驾驶恶魔般的 EVA，而是更因为她的左侧被撕裂，脑浆从颅侧溢出。从他所见，除了满地的血迹外，她的头发是淡蓝色的。

Shinji had then put out a hand grab her wrist and see if she had a pulse. At this point the dying pilot had grabbed his hand forcefully and her eyes had flown open, revealing two blood red globes looking back at him. Shinji had attempted to wrench free of her grip but she simply frowned back at him and whispered, "Why did you let everyone die?"  
真嗣随即伸出手去抓她的手腕，想确认她是否有脉搏。就在这时，垂死的驾驶员猛地抓住他的手，双眼突然睁开，露出两颗血红色的眼球盯着他。真嗣试图挣脱她的握力，但她只是皱着眉头，低声问道：“为什么你让大家都死了？”

---

Shinji had then turned shakily around to see everybody that he had ever met, piled in a bloody heap behind him. It was thanks to this last part that he had sat bolt upright in his futon. Seeing Asuka and Misato torn to shreds was not something that he didn't consider pleasant. Then again, who would?  
真嗣随后颤抖着转身，看到他曾遇见的每一个人都堆叠在他身后，血肉模糊。正是这一幕让他猛地从被褥中坐起。看到明日香和美里被撕成碎片，绝非他所认为的愉快景象。再者，谁又能接受这样的场面呢？

Forcing himself to sit up, he trudged to the bathroom, willing himself not to vomit until he reached the toilet. Several minutes later he had his back to the bathroom door as he had just thrown up a large portion of the stir fry that he had made. Grimacing at the taste of bile he looked down at his hands and realized they were shaking.  
他强迫自己坐起来，拖着沉重的步伐走向浴室，心里不断告诉自己要撑到马桶前再吐。几分钟后，他背靠着浴室门，刚刚吐出了大部分自己做的炒菜。他皱着眉头，对胆汁的味道感到厌恶，低头看着自己的手，发现它们在颤抖。

What confused him most about this dream, or vision, was that the blue haired girl with red eyes had never met him, as far as he could remember. He thought that only people that he had met before, or were always around were people that he would have the visions for.  
这个梦，或者说幻象，最让他困惑的是，那个蓝发红眼的女孩，就他所记得的，从未见过他。他原以为只有那些他之前见过或经常在身边的人，才会出现在他的幻象中。

Leaning his head back against he bathroom door he banged it lightly against it. 'I'm really going insane, aren't I?' He paused, as he fully expected someone to answer him. Without any kind of confirmation to his sanity he open the bathroom door and walked slowly back to his futon, where he immediately fell down and fell asleep.  
他后仰着头靠在浴室门上，轻轻地敲了敲门。'我真的要疯了，不是吗？'他停顿了一下，满心期待有人会回答他。在没有得到任何关于他理智的确认后，他打开浴室门，慢慢走回自己的蒲团，立刻倒下并睡着了。

Shinji walked slowly into the kitchen the next morning already to find Asuka and Misato sitting there, chatting animately. Though when Shinji walked in Asuka frowned at him for a minute before turning back towards Misato.  
第二天早上，真嗣缓缓走进厨房，发现明日香和美里已经坐在那里，正热烈地聊着。然而，当真嗣走进来时，明日香皱着眉头看了他一会儿，然后又转向美里。

In truth Shinji didn't feel that good. Even though he had fallen asleep instantly last night after his dream, he had a splitting headache this morning. Misato therefore realized this, as she watched Shinji try to put the cereal back in the fridge.  
实际上，真嗣感觉并不好。尽管昨晚他一躺下就立刻睡着了，但今早醒来却头痛欲裂。美里注意到了这一点，因为她看到真嗣试图把麦片放回冰箱。

"Err Shinji, are you okay?"  
“呃，真嗣，你还好吗？”

"Yeah, I'm fine, just a little tired is all."  
"嗯，我没事，只是有点累而已。"

Misato frowned at him and said, "No your not, you've got bags under your eyes as if you didn't sleep last night." Standing up she walked over to Shinji and put a hand to his forehead. "You've got a fever, Shinji."  
美里皱着眉头对他说：“不，你看起来可不像没事，你眼睛下面都有黑眼圈了，好像昨晚没睡一样。”她站起来走到真嗣身边，把手放在他的额头上。“你发烧了，真嗣。”

"Well, I suppose that explains why I feel like shit," murmured Shinji. Sighing he sat down at the table then and rested his head on the table.  
"好吧，我想这解释了为什么我感觉这么糟糕，“真嗣低声说。叹了口气，他坐到桌边，把头靠在桌子上。

"Shinji your gonna stay home from school."  
"真嗣，你今天不用去学校了。"

Shinji smirked, 'Fantastic.'  
真嗣微微一笑，'太棒了。'

"And Asuka will stay and take care of you," she finished.  
"明日香会留下来照顾你，"她补充道。"

'Not fantastic,' Shinji corrected. Thankfully that didn't seem to be the case, as Asuka stood up quickly and threw Shinji a scowl. Picking up her plate she dumped it in the sink, turned around and walked towards the front door.  
“不算太好，”真嗣纠正道。幸好这似乎不是实情，因为明日香迅速站起身，向真嗣投去一个怒视。她拿起自己的盘子，扔进水槽，转身走向前门。

"Asuka-" Asuka walked outside and slammed the door, "-wait." Misato stood there for a minute with an annoyed look on her face but started slightly as she felt a hand on her shoulder.  
“明日香——”明日香走出屋外，砰地一声关上门，“——等等。”美里站在那里，脸上带着恼怒的表情，但随即微微一惊，感到有人搭上了她的肩膀。

"Don't worry about it, Misato. I've taken care of myself my entire life so one day isn't going to make a difference. Besides I think I'd get worse if Asuka took care of me. Probably poison me or something."  
“别担心，美里。我一生都是自己照顾自己，一天不会有什么差别的。再说，如果让明日香来照顾我，我可能会更惨。说不定会给我下毒什么的。”

"She may dislike you but thats going far even for her."  
"她可能不喜欢你，但这也太过分了，连她都不会这么做。"

Shinji thought that it was a lot more than just dislike but didn't feel like saying anything.  
真嗣认为这不仅仅是讨厌，但他不想说什么。

"Well, Shinji, if you think that you'll be fine on your own that I guess that I'll try not to worry. I'd stay home myself but I've got to work at Nerv."  
"好吧，真嗣，如果你觉得自己一个人没问题，那我想我尽量不担心。我本来想待在家里，但我得去 NERV 工作。"

"Thanks, Misato." "谢谢你，美里。"

Misato smiled then and patted Shinji gently on the shoulder and then walked out the door.  
美里随即微笑着，轻轻拍了拍真嗣的肩膀，然后走出了房门。

Shinji would have gladly liked to tell her how much it ment to him that she had considered staying home with him but found that something was stuck in his throat. Wheeling around he decided that the best course of action was to try and force himself to get some sleep.  
真嗣本想告诉她，她考虑留在家陪他对他来说意义重大，却发现喉咙里像是哽住了什么。他转过身，决定最好的办法是强迫自己试着入睡。

---

At school, Asuka was bored to the limit. Everything that the teacher was talking about she had already learned. Several times she had turned around to make some comment about the stupidity of the teacher, only to remember that Shinji was at home sick.  
在学校，明日香无聊到了极点。老师讲的那些内容她早已学过。她几次转过身来，想对老师的愚蠢发表些评论，却突然记起真嗣因病在家。

'Tch, probably forced himself to throw up so he could skip school. Sick fuck,' she thought with a grimace. Even so without him here she was bored. At least he wasn't like all the other boys in the class, who seemed to get disgusting thoughts every time she walked in front of them. Though she was torn away from her thoughts to find a very disgusting reality awaiting him.  
“切，八成是自己逼着吐了，好逃学。病态的家伙，”她皱着眉头想。即便如此，没有他在，她还是感到无聊。至少他不像班上其他男生那样，每次她从他们面前走过时，似乎都会产生恶心的念头。尽管她的思绪被拉回，发现一个非常恶心的现实在等着他。

"Oh yes," yes said the teacher as he saw the door opening. "I had forgotten that you would be returning today."  
“哦，是的，”老师看到门打开时说道，“我忘了你今天会回来。”

Asuka narrowed her eyes to those of a hawk as she saw the light blue haired girl with red eyes walk in.  
明日香眯起眼睛，锐利如鹰，看着那个有着淡蓝色头发、红色眼睛的女孩走了进来。

"As I'm sure everyone remembers Ayanami Rei, I see no reason in reintroducing her. Anyway Ayanami, go ahead and take your usual seat."  
“我相信大家都记得绫波零，所以没必要再介绍她了。总之，绫波，去坐你平常的座位吧。”

At this Asuka had spun around to look around the room, only to find out that the only empty desk was the one next to hers.  
听到这话，明日香转过身来环视教室，却发现唯一空着的座位就在她旁边。

'This day just keeps getting shittier and shittier,' she thought as Ayanami sat down next to her.  
'今天真是越来越糟糕了，'她想着，当绫波坐在她旁边时。

---

'Where am I?' '我在哪儿？'

'_Where else but where you truly belong.'_  
'除了你真正属于的地方，还能是哪儿呢。'

It was then that Shinji inhaled a large amount of fluid. He felt like he was going to drown but next second realized that he was floating in LCL fluid and felt his body relax as oxygen filled his lungs.  
就在那时，真嗣吸入了一大口液体。他感觉自己快要溺水了，但下一秒意识到自己正漂浮在 LCL 液体中，随着氧气充满肺部，他的身体放松了下来。

The first thing he realized that he was naked as he floated helplessly, though that didn't seem to bother him. Around him was total blackness and he tried to spin around to look below him. Finding out that he was unable to move he continued looking up, where it all looked the same.  
他首先意识到自己赤身裸体地无助漂浮着，尽管这似乎并没有困扰他。四周一片漆黑，他试图旋转身体向下看。发现无法移动后，他继续向上看，那里看起来都一样。

'_This is where you truly belong.'_  
'这才是你真正的归属之地。'

Shinji started slightly, as he had forgotten entirely about the eerie voice.  
真嗣微微一惊，他完全忘记了那个诡异的声音。

'Who are you? What do you mean by this is were I belong? I hate this place.'  
'你是谁？你说的‘这是我该在的地方’是什么意思？我讨厌这个地方。'

'_Oh I think you'll grow to love it. Once you get used to the smell its quite pleasant to float there forever.'_  
'哦，我想你会逐渐爱上它的。一旦习惯了那股气味，永远漂浮在那里其实相当惬意。'

'I don't care, I have no reason to enjoy being here.'  
'我不在乎，我没有理由喜欢待在这里。'

'_So you don't care if something like this were to happen.'_  
'所以你不在乎这种事情是否会发生。'

The blackness became whiteness and then turned to crimson as the scene unfolded. It was similar to what Shinji had dreamt, except it was worse...far worse. Blood and gore was strung across Tokyo-3. There was so much blood and bodily fluids that the drainage systems were overflowing. It looked as though someone had spilled several thousand gallons of fruit punch and let it sit there. Except this fruit punch had pieces in it.  
黑暗转为光明，随后化作猩红，场景逐渐展开。这与真嗣梦中的情景相似，只是更加糟糕……糟糕得多。东京-3 四处血肉横飞。血液和体液如此之多，以至于排水系统都已溢出。看起来仿佛有人倾倒了数千加仑的果汁，任其流淌。只不过这果汁里混杂着碎片。

Shinji stared in horror as the scene unfolded and he was shown a rewound version of the events. The fifth angel appeared and Eva Unit-02 was deployed along with a blue and orange Eva that Shinji had not seen. Shinji watch, stunned, as the angel slashed through the earth with its energy whips, missing the two Eva's several times. Soon the Eva's lost their umbilical cord and were forced to fight on reserve power.  
真嗣惊恐地盯着眼前展开的场景，他被展示了一段倒放的事件版本。第五使徒出现，Eva 二号机与一架蓝橙相间的 Eva 被部署，这是真嗣未曾见过的。真嗣目瞪口呆地看着使徒用能量鞭划过大地，多次险些击中两架 Eva。不久，Eva 们失去了脐带电缆，被迫依靠备用电源战斗。

After that it was a battle of attrition. Soon Eva Unit-02 lost one of its arms and was sliced down the middle. Shinji had to turn away as he could almost hear Asuka's scream of pain and anger. The angel approached the Eva, to finish it off, when the blue and orange one came from the side and knocked the angel off balance. Pulling something that looked remarkably like a knife, it stabbed the angel in the chest. Repeating this several times, to no affect, the angel pushed the Eva off itself and proceeding to slashing it several more times.  
此后便是一场消耗战。很快，Eva 二号机失去了一只手臂，并被从中劈开。真嗣不得不转过头去，他几乎能听到明日香痛苦与愤怒的尖叫声。使徒逼近 Eva，准备给予致命一击，这时那架蓝橙相间的 Eva 从侧面冲来，将使徒撞得失去平衡。它抽出一把酷似刀的东西，猛刺使徒的胸膛。重复数次，却毫无效果，使徒将 Eva 推开，并继续对其进行多次劈砍。

Dodging was all the blue and orange Eva could do as its energy slowly drained. Charging forward in stabbed outwards only to have its hand sliced off and fall to the ground. Red blood flew from the angels hand as it dropped to one knee as its energy ran out. The angel observed it for a moment before looping off its head.  
蓝色与橙色的 Eva 只能不断躲避，随着能量逐渐耗尽。它冲向前试图攻击，却只换来一只手被切断，坠落地面。天使的手中喷涌出鲜血，它单膝跪地，能量耗尽。天使凝视片刻，随后斩下了它的头颅。

What followed next was random flashes of things that happened. Shinji watched as the angel sliced into a building, incinerating many humans but for the most part cutting of body parts and leaving them to bleed. Shinji watched as people from his class were killed or crushed. Toji and Kensuke where both crushed by falling rubble and Shinji had a strong urge to vomit after he heard their bones crunching. A particular painful moment happened as he watched Misato cradling a broken arm and crawling forward. A sharp piece of metal had sliced her leg off, just above the knee, preventing her from moving far.  
接下来是一连串混乱的闪回。真嗣目睹天使劈开一座建筑，大量人类被焚烧，但多数是被切断肢体，任其流血。他看到同班同学被杀或压碎。铃和健介都被落石压碎，真嗣听到他们骨头碎裂的声音，强烈地想要呕吐。尤其痛苦的一幕是，他看到美里抱着断臂，艰难爬行。一块尖锐的金属切断了她的腿，就在膝盖上方，使她无法远行。

Hardest of all was watching as Asuka slowly died. To the bitter end she tried to fight back, even though her Eva wasn't responding. When the angel had sliced her Eva in half it had only pierced part of the entry. Thanks to this Asuka didn't die immediately but it would have been kinder. She had been pierced in the stomach and now a mixture of blood and stomach acid was flowing from the open wound. Several times Shinji heard his own named mentioned in the mixture of swear words from the different languages she had learned.  
最难熬的是看着明日香慢慢死去。直到最后一刻，她仍在试图反抗，尽管她的 Eva 毫无反应。当使徒将她的 Eva 劈成两半时，只刺穿了部分插入栓。多亏了这一点，明日香没有立即死去，但那或许更为仁慈。她被刺穿了腹部，现在血液和胃酸正从开放的伤口中流出。几次听到自己的名字夹杂在她所学过的各种语言的咒骂中，真嗣感到一阵心痛。

Now Shinji hovered over the remains of what remained of the other Eva unit. Its entry plug had not been crushed surprisingly and Shinji found himself remembering more and more of his dream as events from it unfolded before his eyes. He saw the arm of the pilot sticking out, but now he saw something else...he was approaching it. His self from the vision was approaching the arm as it dangled lifelessly out of the Eva, and Shinji understood.  
现在，真嗣悬停在另一台 Eva 残骸的上方。令人惊讶的是，它的插入栓并未被压碎，随着梦境中的事件在眼前展开，真嗣发现自己越来越多地回忆起那个梦。他看到驾驶员的手臂伸出，但现在他看到了别的东西...他在接近它。梦境中的自己正接近那只从 Eva 中无力垂下的手臂，真嗣明白了。

Once again this was something that may or may not happen, and this time his decision controlled all of Tokyo-3.  
这又一次可能是也可能不会发生的事情，而这次他的决定将左右整个第三新东京市的命运。

"Figure it out yet?" "想明白了没？"

Shinji felt his body move on its own as he turned around and looked up at the Asuka from his dreams.  
真嗣感觉到自己的身体不由自主地动了起来，他转过身，抬头看向梦中出现的明日香。

"Nice little battle, to bad you weren't there, might have made a difference."  
"一场精彩的小战斗，可惜你不在，不然可能会改变些什么。"

"Are you here to give my advice or mock me?" Asked Shinji.  
"你是来给我建议的还是来嘲笑我的？" 真嗣问道。

"Oh, I'm done giving advice, I'm just here for the show.  
"哦，建议我已经给完了，现在我只是来看戏的。

"Thoughtful of you." "你真是体贴。"

Shinji's body turned then as if to show what happened one final time. 'I know what I've got to do, its just doing it is the problem.'  
真嗣的身体随后转了过来，仿佛要最后一次展示发生了什么。'我知道我必须做什么，只是做起来是个问题。'

"If your done feeling sorry for yourself I suggest you go back."  
“如果你已经自怜自艾够了，我建议你回去。”

"Why? I thought you weren't giving advice anymore."  
“为什么？我以为你不再提供建议了。”

"Don't think of it so much as advice. More of a friendly reminder."  
"别把它想成是建议，更像是友好的提醒。"

"Your my friend?" "你是我的朋友？"

Asuka scratched her chin thoughtfully, "Hmmm, I suppose, for now at least I am. Put it this way I don't want you to die."  
明日香若有所思地挠了挠下巴，“嗯，我想，至少目前我是。这么说吧，我不想你死。”

"Thanks...I think."  "谢谢...我想。"

---

Shinji felt his eyes open and if not for the fact that he heard the slamming of a door he would have thought thats what woke him up. Sitting up straighter he assumed that it wasn't Misato and could only guess that it had to be Asuka. Looking over, he noticed that it was a few minutes after noon. So she had left school early again.  
真嗣感到自己的眼睛睁开了，如果不是听到了门被猛力关上的声音，他可能会以为这就是唤醒他的原因。他坐得更直了些，猜测那不是美里，只能猜想那一定是明日香。他环顾四周，注意到已经是中午过后几分钟了。所以她又提前离开了学校。

Standing up, Shinji walked towards his bedroom door and slid it open slightly. Next second the door was slammed shut and Shinji was forced to take a step back.  
真嗣站起身，走向他的卧室门，轻轻地滑开了一点。下一秒，门被猛地关上，真嗣不得不后退了一步。

Slightly worried about her he took a hesitant step and said, "Err, Asuka...is everything okay?"  
他略感担忧，犹豫地迈出一步，问道：“呃，明日香……一切都还好吗？”

Without getting an answer he slid the door open again and this time without it getting shut in his face. Looking around quickly he didn't see her sitting at the kitchen table but heard talking coming from the living room.  
没有得到回答，他再次拉开门，这次没有被门甩在脸上。他迅速环顾四周，没看到她在厨房的桌子旁，却听到客厅传来说话声。

Walking into it, slightly nervous, he saw her laying on the couch, eating a bag of potato chips and flipping through the channels.  
他略带紧张地走进去，看到她正躺在沙发上，吃着一袋薯片，不停地换着电视频道。

Opening his mouth, Shinji was about to ask if anything had happened at school when he got rude answer.  
张开口，真嗣正要问学校是否发生了什么事，却得到了一个粗鲁的回答。

"Shut it Shinji, I don't want to talk you!"  
“闭嘴，真嗣，我不想跟你说话！”

Shinji raised an eyebrow at her. Did he do something that had made her angry? For the life of him he couldn't remember. Maybe it was what Misato had said about her staying home and looking after him. Shinji really couldn't care if she was there or not. It didn't make any difference to him whatsoever. Even so though he was annoyed that she was angry at him for something that he probably didn't even do.  
真嗣对她挑了挑眉。他做了什么让她生气的事吗？他怎么也想不起来。也许是因为美里提到她留在家里照顾他。真嗣真的不在乎她在不在。这对他没有任何影响。即便如此，他还是对她因为他可能根本没做过的事而生气感到不爽。

Smirking slightly he said, "What, did someone sneak a peak while you were at the drinking fountain again?"  
他微微冷笑道：“怎么，又有人在饮水机旁偷看你了？”

Asuka tore her eyes away from the T.V. briefly to give Shinji a heart piercing stare. Without replying to his comment she turned her gaze back towards the T.V.  
绫波零短暂地从电视上移开目光，向真嗣投去一个穿心的瞪视。她没有回应他的话，又将视线转回了电视。

'Guess she really doesn't want to talk, but I know one thing she will want to discuss.'  
“看来她真的不想说话，但我知道有一件事她肯定会想讨论。”

Walking out of the living room he walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge door. Yelling over he shoulder he said, "So what does your highness want for dinner tonight?"  
他走出客厅，步入厨房，打开了冰箱门。他扭头喊道：“那么，尊贵的大人今晚想吃什么呢？”

Shinji thought he heard something between a snarl and half a laugh.  
真嗣觉得他听到了介于咆哮和半声笑之间的声音。

Replying back she said, "Whatever the fuck you feel like. I don't give a shit right now."  
她回敬道：“随便你他妈想做什么。我现在不在乎。”

'Wow,' thought Shinji. 'If she didn't care about dinner than something pretty bad must have happened.  
'哇哦，' 真嗣心想。'如果她连晚饭都不在乎了，那一定是发生了相当糟糕的事情。

Ignoring dinner for now he walked back into the living room and stood directly in front of him.  
暂时不理会晚饭，他走回客厅，直接站在他面前。

"Move it ass-hole." “滚开，混蛋。”

"No. If you don't even care about dinner than something obviously happened."  
"不，如果你连晚饭都不在乎，那显然是发生了什么事。"

"It doesn't concern you!"  
"这不关你的事！"

"It might not but the Asuka I see in front of me is one that I certainly don't like living with."  
"可能不关我的事，但我眼前的这个明日香，绝对不是我想一起生活的样子。"

"As if you enjoy living with me anyway," she whispered.  
"好像你本来就很享受和我一起生活似的，" 她低声说道。

"On occasion I do, if you must know," mumbled Shinji.  
"偶尔是的，如果你非要知道的话，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka seemed rather taken aback at this and her expression soften slightly. "Fine baka, if you must know I have to sit next to my least favorite person in the world at school now."  
明日香对此似乎颇为意外，她的表情稍稍缓和了一些。"好吧，笨蛋，如果你非要知道的话，我现在在学校不得不坐在世界上最讨厌的人旁边。"

Shinji almost laughed, "I thought I was your least favorite person in the world."  
真嗣差点笑出声来，“我以为我是你在这个世界上最不喜欢的人呢。”

"Its close, but your my second least favorite."  
“差不多吧，但你是我第二不喜欢的人。”

"Glad to hear it. So why the hell is this such a problem?"  
“很高兴听到这个。那这他妈的为什么是个问题？”

"Because I also have to-" Asuka paused, mentioning that Rei was the pilot of Eva Unit-00 wouldn't be smart. Shinji was supposed to know as little as possible if he wouldn't pilot Unit-01, at least thats what Misato said.  
"因为我也得——" 明日香停顿了一下，提到绫波是零号机的驾驶员并不明智。如果真嗣不驾驶初号机，他应该知道得越少越好，至少美里是这么说的。

"I just don't like people like her, she's stuck up, thinks she's so great."  
"我就是不喜欢她那种人，她自命不凡，觉得自己了不起。"

Shinji frowned, "You act as though you know her personally."  
真嗣皱眉道："你表现得好像很了解她似的。"

Thankfully Asuka was saved the need of replying when her phone vibrated briefly. Flipping it open she read a very short message from Misato. Flipping it closed she bit her lip slightly and stood up.  
幸好，当她的手机短暂震动时，明日香免去了回答的必要。她翻开手机，看到美里发来的一条简短信息。合上手机后，她微微咬了咬嘴唇，站起身来。

"Anything wrong, Asuka?" “有什么不对劲吗，明日香？”

"No, I just have to go to Nerv and do some tests, its standard."  
“没有，我只是得去 NERV 做一些测试，这是常规流程。”

Shinji nodded, "Then what do you want for dinner?"  
真嗣点点头，“那你想吃什么晚餐？”

This time Asuka gave him a long list of German foods and told him to just make one every night and to start at the top of the list. Shinji frowned down at it not liking some of the choices.  
这次明日香给了他一份长长的德国食物清单，并告诉他每晚做一种，从清单顶部开始。真嗣皱着眉头看着它，不喜欢其中的一些选择。

"I'll be back late, with Misato most likely."  
“我可能会晚点回来，和美里一起。”

"Okay..." Shinji felt like he had to say something but couldn't quite get his tongue wrapped around it.  
"好吧..." 真嗣觉得他得说点什么，但舌头就是绕不过来。

"Cya later then." "那回头见。"

"Yeah bye," Shinji mumbled.  
"嗯，再见，" 真嗣咕哝道。

When Asuka closed the door she flipped open her phone and called Misato as she started to run slightly. The first thing that she heard was a lot of rambling in the back round when Misato answered the phone.  
当明日香关上门时，她迅速打开手机，边跑边拨通了美里。她听到的第一件事是美里接电话时背景中的一大堆杂音。

"Asuka are you on your way."  
“明日香，你已经在路上了吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Good, we don't have much time. It will hit land fall in thirty minutes. I'll brief you quickly and then we'll send you up." Here Misato paused and asked, "What did you tell Shinji?"  
“很好，我们时间不多了。它将在三十分钟后登陆。我会快速给你简报，然后我们就派你上去。”这时美里停顿了一下，问道，“你告诉真嗣什么了？”

"Tests," she said simply.  
"测试," 她简单地说道。

"Good, having two kids to worry about will just make me age faster."  
"好啊，有两个孩子要担心只会让我老得更快。"

Even though the joke had good intentions Asuka wasn't in the mood for joking around. The last thing she intended to do was tell Shinji what she really was doing, though she guessed he'd realize it in half an hour.  
尽管这个玩笑本意是好的，但明日香此刻并没有心情开玩笑。她最不想做的就是告诉真嗣她真正在做什么，尽管她猜他半小时后就会意识到。

---

Shinji had guessed that something was wrong, judging by the brief worried look that had passed over Asuka's face the moment she had gotten off the phone with Misato. Completely ignoring thoughts of dinner he sat down on the couch where Asuka had recently laid. The first thing that had come to his mind was an angel attack, though she had shot that idea down quickly with her mention of tests. But he didn't believe her, tests couldn't make a person go from calm to nervous in the span of seconds, and Asuka was not someone to get riled up easily.  
从明日香接完美里电话后那一闪而过的忧虑表情，真嗣猜测事情有些不对劲。他完全忽略了晚餐的想法，坐在了明日香刚刚躺过的沙发上。他首先想到的是使徒袭击，但她提到测试时迅速否定了这个想法。但他并不相信，测试不可能让人在几秒钟内从平静变得紧张，而明日香也不是那种轻易会被激怒的人。

Rolling off the couch he stood up and walked over to the nearest window and looked briefly.  
他从沙发上滚下来，站起身走到最近的窗户旁，短暂地向外望去。

'Well, if an angel was to show I'd feel it before I saw it,' he thought.  
“嗯，如果有使徒出现，我会在看到之前就感应到。”他心想。

Turning around he was about to walk to the kitchen to make a half hearted attempt on one of the many things that Asuka had give him to cook when he noticed the ceiling fan shake. Pausing for a moment he looked up at it again and it gave another small wobble, slightly larger than last time.  
他转过身，正打算走向厨房，勉强尝试做明日香给他的众多菜谱中的一项，这时他注意到天花板风扇在摇晃。他停顿了一下，再次抬头看去，风扇又轻轻晃动了一下，比上次幅度稍大。

Next, Shinji felt the ground beneath him shake violently and he had to brace himself so as not to fall on his face. When the tremors had settled he immediately bolted towards the door. Only then did he realize that an alarm had gone off and people were crowding around on the streets below, looking for a suitable shelter.  
紧接着，真嗣感觉到脚下的地面剧烈震动，他不得不稳住自己以免摔倒。当震动平息后，他立刻冲向门口。直到那时，他才意识到警报已经响起，人们正聚集在下面的街道上，寻找合适的避难所。

"Damn it, she didn't have to lie to me."  
“该死，她没必要对我撒谎。”

Taking off down the stairs he had to weave in and out of the sea of people that were trying to get to the shelter first. In the back round a cool female voice was telling everyone not to panic and to enter the shelters in an orderly fashion. Shinji had to smirk at the calmness in her voice. It was obviously a pre-recording and whoever had done it was miles away by now.  
他迅速冲下楼梯，不得不在试图抢先到达避难所的人群中穿梭。背景中，一个冷静的女声在告诉每个人不要惊慌，有序进入避难所。真嗣不得不对她的镇定语气暗自一笑。显然这是一段预先录制的音频，而录制者此刻早已远在千里之外。

Fighting his way out of the mass of people he managed to recognize two people from his class, Touji and Kensuke. Shinji was almost tempted to approach them but was deterred when he remembered what they had done to both him and Asuka. It seemed though that they had something they wanted to discuss as they both ran up to him.  
他奋力挤出人群，认出了班上的两个人，东治和健介。真嗣几乎想上前打招呼，但随即想起了他们对他和明日香所做的一切，便打消了念头。不过，他们似乎有话要说，两人都向他跑来。

"Hey fuck face!" “嘿，混蛋！”

Shinji had a sudden urge to rip Touji's skull out of his head but restrained himself. Asking in as calm a voice as he could muster he said, "What?"  
真嗣突然有种冲动，想把东治的头骨从他脑袋里扯出来，但还是忍住了。他尽可能平静地问道：“什么？”

"Where's Asuka, you live with her right, sleaze ball?"  
“惣流在哪里，你不是和她住一起吗，人渣？”

'Of course, they only wanted to know where she was.'  
“当然，他们只是想知道她在哪里。”

"No idea where she went, she took off immediately after she got home." Even though he wasn't a part of Nerv, telling other people what Asuka was involved with was not something that he considered telling.  
"不知道她去哪儿了，一回家就立刻离开了。" 尽管他不是 Nerv 的一员，但告诉别人关于明日香的事情，并不是他会考虑的事情。

"Tch, dick head you just want her all yo yourself."  
"切，你个混蛋就是想独占她。"

"Yeah, whatever," said Shinji not caring at all at this point.  
"是啊，随便吧，" 真嗣此时根本不在乎。

Turning around he started walking away when he felt a strong hand on his shoulder.  
他转过身，正要走开，却感到一只强有力的手搭在了他的肩膀上。

"Hey where you even listening to me!"  
“嘿，你到底有没有在听我说话！”

Shinji scowled back, "I tend to ignore people who bother the shit out of me."  
真嗣皱着眉头回道：“我通常会无视那些让我烦得要死的人。”

"Why you bastard!" “你这个混蛋！”

Touji brought his hand back to punch Shinji in the face again when he heard another voice over the loud speaker, this time slightly different.  
当听到另一个通过扩音器传来的声音，这次略有不同，真嗣准备再次挥拳打向真治的脸时，东治停了下来。

"Those that have not entered a shelter block please do so immediately, the city will descend in five minutes."  
“尚未进入避难区的市民请立即前往，城市将在五分钟后下沉。”

"Touji we should get to one," said a worried Kensuke.  
"图尔基，我们得去一个避难所。" 健介担忧地说道。

"Fine." "好吧。"

Touji backed away from Shinji and threw a scowl at him before turning towards the shelter blocks only to find that none now remained.  
图尔基从真嗣身边退开，向他投去一个怒视，然后转向避难所区块，却发现现在一个也不剩了。

"God damn it, look at what you made us do."  
"该死的，看看你让我们做了什么。"

"Its your one fault for harassing me, so if you die don't expect me to cry over your body"  
"这就是你骚扰我的代价，所以如果你死了，别指望我会为你流泪。"

"Thats it fuck face I'm beating the shit out of you."  
"就这样了，混蛋，我要把你打得屁滚尿流。"

Touji took several steps forward and probably would have knocked Shinji out again if Kensuke hadn't stepped in between them.  
冬二向前走了几步，要不是剑介及时插到他们中间，他可能又要给真嗣一拳。

"Guys this isn't the time to be fighting, we need to find another shelter before Tokyo-3 goes into lockdown."  
“伙计们，现在不是打架的时候，我们需要在东京-3 进入封锁前找到另一个避难所。”

As much as Shinji hated these two, Kensuke had a point. If Tokyo-3 sank into the Geofront then they'd fall several hundred feet to there death.  
尽管真嗣讨厌这两个人，但剑介说得有道理。如果东京-3 沉入地底，他们就会从几百英尺的高处坠落而死。

"Whatever, just stay out of my way," said Touji.  
“随便你，别挡我的路就行，”冬二说道。

'Likewise,' though Shinji.  
“彼此彼此，”真嗣心想。

Together the trio ran through the streets of Tokyo-3 quickly searching for a shelter, though without much luck.  
三人一起在第三新东京市的街道上奔跑，急切地寻找避难所，却运气不佳。

"Hey Shinji I'm rather surprised that your not with Asuka actually," said Kensuke.  
“嘿，真嗣，我挺惊讶你居然没和明日香在一起，”健介说道。

Shinji blinked back at him, rather surprised, "What makes you say that?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼看着他，同样感到惊讶，“你为什么这么说？”

Kensuke shrugged, "Well, you certainly know her better than anybody else at the school so it seems natural that you'd be with her more."  
健介耸了耸肩，“嗯，你在学校里肯定比任何人都更了解她，所以看起来你和她在一起更自然。”

"I...suppose," Shinji said slowly.  
"我...我想是的," 真嗣缓缓说道。

"But what are you doing out here. Where you looking for her?"  
"但你在这里做什么？是在找她吗？"

Shinji had to think about that for a second. What was he really doing out here? He already knew where and what Asuka was doing and he didn't have any inclination to go to where she was. Even so though, there was something akin to a driving force pushing him forward.  
真嗣不得不思考了一下。他到底在这里做什么？他已经知道明日香在哪里以及她在做什么，而且他也没有任何冲动想要去找她。即便如此，却有一种类似驱动力的东西在推动他前进。

Shaking his head he said, "Not sure, can't give you a correct answer."  
他摇摇头说：“不确定，没法给你一个正确的答案。”

"Hmm I see," nodded Kensuke thoughtfully.  
“嗯，我明白了，”健介若有所思地点点头。

Shinji was slightly annoyed at how Kensuke was acting around him right now. It was almost as if he was somebody that he had just met and everything that he had done to him was completely thrown out the window. If he thought they were friends he was sorely wrong.  
真嗣对健介此刻对待他的态度感到有些恼火。这简直就像是他刚刚认识的一个人，之前为他所做的一切都被抛诸脑后。如果他认为他们是朋友，那他可就大错特错了。

"Come on lets check over here."  
“快点，我们去那边看看。”

As soon as Shinji got the words out of his mouth the earth shook violently as the angel made landfall. Simultaneously Eva Unit-02 was brought up the elevator and broke the surface just to see the angel make landfall.  
真嗣话音刚落，大地便剧烈震动起来，天使登陆了。与此同时，EVA 二号机被升降机升起，破土而出，正好目睹天使登陆的瞬间。

Kensuke and Touji stood in a slight daze as they watched the Eva charge towards the oncoming angel.  
健介和薰站在原地，略显恍惚地看着 EVA 向迎面而来的天使冲去。

"Wha-what is that?" Stuttered the stupid jock.  
“那、那是什么？”那个笨蛋运动员结巴道。

Shinji didn't feel like explaining and just yelled over his shoulder, "Forget it we need to find a shelter."  
真嗣不想解释，只是回头喊道：“别管了，我们得找个避难所。”

As the two ran they could here the crumbling of buildings as the ones not brought into the Geofront crumble while the two fought.  
两人奔跑时，可以听到建筑倒塌的声音，那些未被带入地底都市的建筑在两人的战斗中崩塌。

Several seconds later the three of them found a shelter that still had some room left in it, however it could only hold two more people. The trio stood there briefly while the person holding the door open waited at the argument that was soon going to break out. Touji was prepared to fight for his if he had to when he heard someone laugh and say, "Get in you idiots, I never intended on entering a shelter anyway."  
几秒钟后，他们三人找到了一个还有些空间的避难所，不过只能再容纳两个人。三人短暂地站在那里，而那个扶着门的人则在等待即将爆发的争执。当听到有人笑道“进去吧，你们这些傻瓜，反正我也没打算进避难所。”时，东治已经准备好为他的位置而战了。

Spinning around, Touji and Kensuke saw Shinji smirking back at them.  
东治和真嗣转过身，看到真嗣正对他们得意地笑着。

"Get your asses in, this is what we've been walking around for haven't we."  
“快点进去，我们不就是为了这个才四处走的吗。”

Touji hoped directly in but Kensuke was a little hesitant. "Shinji you are going to look for another one, right?"  
真嗣直接走了进去，但剑介有些犹豫。“真嗣，你会去找另一个的，对吧？”

Shinji shrugged, "Maybe..." He already knew he wouldn't.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，“也许吧……”他其实已经知道他不会去。

Kensuke nodded and walked in behind Touji and the door was closed.  
剑介点点头，跟在真嗣后面走了进去，门随后被关上了。

Shinji had already turned around when Kensuke entered the shelter and was already walking in the opposite direction, to where the two demons were fighting, as he saw them.  
真嗣在健司进入避难所时已经转身，正朝着两个恶魔战斗的方向走去，他看到了他们。

'That Eva is definitely Asuka's, I just hope she can take that thing on.'  
'那台 EVA 肯定是明日香的，我只希望她能对付得了那东西。'

Turning around a corner he was hit in the face by a whirlwind of dust and small debris as a building had just collapsed that the angel had fallen in. Coughing slightly he looked up just to see the Eva flying through the air as the angel had counterattacked and wrapped several energy whips around the Eva's arm, and thrown it.  
转过一个拐角，他被一阵由建筑物倒塌引起的尘土和小碎片旋风击中了脸。轻轻咳嗽了一下，他抬头一看，只见 EVA 被天使反击，几条能量鞭缠绕在 EVA 的手臂上，将其抛向空中。

Quickly darting into an alley way Shinji just barely managed to dodge a car as it went soaring directly over where he had been standing moments before. Looking around the corner he saw the Eva get back up quickly and stare down its enemy. Grabbing something from a holster in its back it brought a small knife out which glowed white and charged at the angel.  
迅速闪入一条小巷，真嗣险些躲过一辆疾驰而过的汽车，那车几乎是擦着他刚才站立的地方飞驰而过。探头望向拐角，他看到初号机迅速起身，直面敌人。从背后的枪套中抽出某物，手中亮起一把白色光芒的小刀，向天使冲去。

Slicing across what would be considered its chest, the angel took several steps back to avoid it. Grabbing the arm that had the knife in it, it quickly twisted it and Shinji heard several pops as the arm joints disconnected.  
刀锋划过天使的胸前，它连退几步避开攻击。随即抓住持刀的手臂，迅速扭转，真嗣听到几声关节脱位的脆响。

Shinji was starting to become worried as the angel was repeatedly slashing at Unit-02. Next second though the ground shook again and several feet in front of him soared up the one that he had pilot Eva Unit-01.  
随着天使不断攻击二号机，真嗣开始感到担忧。然而下一秒，地面再次震动，在他前方几英尺处，他驾驶的初号机一飞冲天。

Shinji stared at it and could almost hear that voice in the back of his head. What he couldn't understand though was how someone else was able to pilot it. He had thought that anybody else that tried to pilot it would immediately die.  
真嗣盯着它，几乎能听到脑海深处的那个声音。但他无法理解的是，为什么其他人能够驾驶它。他曾以为任何试图驾驶它的人都会立即丧命。

Next second though, as the Eva tried to take several clumsy steps forward, it fell directly on its side and fell silent.  
然而下一秒，当 EVA 试图笨拙地向前迈出几步时，它直接侧身倒下，陷入了沉默。

Shinji was several hundred feet away from where the Eva fell and hesitated as he looked at its motionless body. He felt as though some unnatural force was pulling him towards the Eva. Inching closer he hesitated as he reached the entry plug and glanced around at anything that would open it.  
真嗣距离 EVA 倒下的地方有几百英尺远，他犹豫地看着它一动不动的身体。他感觉有一种超自然的力量在拉扯着他向 EVA 靠近。他慢慢接近，当到达插入栓时，他犹豫了一下，环顾四周寻找任何可以打开它的东西。

Reaching out for it a gust of wind threatened to knock him over as Unit 02 sent the angel backwards against a building collapsing it several blocks away from where Shinji stood. Looking behind himself hesitantly, he reached out for the handle for which he thought opened the entry plug. Though at the first touch of it he pulled back quickly as blisters erupted all over his skin. It was well over oven temperature.  
伸手去抓，一阵狂风差点将他吹倒，02 号机将使徒击退，使其撞上远处的一栋建筑，几条街区外，真嗣站立的地方轰然倒塌。他犹豫地回头望去，伸手去抓他认为能打开插入栓的把手。然而，刚一触碰，他便迅速缩回手，皮肤上瞬间冒出水泡。温度早已超过了烤箱的极限。

Grimacing at the pain now racking his right hand he took a deep breath, and for the life of him couldn't understand why he was doing it, and gripped both hands on the valve and twisted it.  
他因右手的剧痛而皱眉，深吸一口气，尽管自己也不明白为何要这么做，但还是用双手紧紧抓住阀门，用力旋转。

Ignoring the steadily increasing pain on his hands he turned the valve until it was all the way on the other side.  
他无视手上不断加剧的疼痛，转动阀门直到完全转到另一侧。

As the entry plug opened several gallons of LCL fluid leaked out, showering Shinji in it. Spitting a mouthful of the disgusting liquid he got his first look at the first child, Ayanami Rei.  
随着插入栓打开，几加仑的 LCL 液体泄漏出来，将真嗣淋了个透。他吐出一口这令人作呕的液体，第一次见到了第一适格者，绫波零。

Shinji didn't know what he had expected but not this. She was the person that he'd dreamt about. She had light blue hair and dark blue eyes, but the face...puzzled him. It seemed familiar somehow.  
真嗣不知道自己期待的是什么，但绝不是这样。她是他梦见过的人。她有着淡蓝色的头发和深蓝色的眼睛，但那张脸……让他感到困惑。不知为何，它似乎有些熟悉。

Hesitating slightly Shinji asked in a voice that sounded like it didn't want to be answered, "Hey, are you okay?"  
真嗣略显迟疑地问道，声音听起来似乎并不期待得到回答，“嘿，你还好吗？”

The girl shifted slightly at first and then slowly looked to where Shinji was looking in from the outside. Her expression was unreadable, neither happy nor angry that someone had asked her if she was all right.  
女孩起初微微动了动，随后缓缓转向真嗣从外面注视的方向。她的表情难以捉摸，既不高兴也不生气，有人问她是否还好。

Sitting slowly up in the plug Shinji then noticed that beads of sweat were on her eyes brows and she seemed to be clutching her side slightly.  
真嗣慢慢坐起身来，注意到她眼眉上挂着汗珠，似乎在轻轻按着侧腹。

Shinji bit his tongue. Here was this completely weird girl, who he had been dreaming about, and now he had just met her. What's more she seemed to be clutching her side as though she was injured.  
真嗣咬了咬舌头。这个完全古怪的女孩，他一直梦见的人，现在他刚刚遇见了她。更甚的是，她似乎在按着侧腹，好像受了伤。

Shinji was about to open his mouth though when the girl, surprisingly beat him to it.  
正当真嗣准备开口时，那女孩却出人意料地抢先了一步。

"Are you Ikari Shinji?" “你是碇真嗣吗？”

For some reason the mention of his last named seemed to anger him and a slight crease appeared on his forehead before he said, "Yeah I am."  
不知为何，提到他的姓氏似乎激怒了他，眉间微微皱起，随后他答道：“是的，我是。”

The girl nodded slightly and then got up shakily from the Eva Unit and hobbled slowly over to the opening in the plug.  
女孩微微点头，然后颤抖着从 Eva 机体中站起，一瘸一拐地慢慢走向插入栓的开口处。

"Hey what are you doing?" Asked Shinji as the girl got out.  
“嘿，你在干什么？”真嗣问道，看着女孩走出来。

Either she didn't here him or ignored his comment, either way she didn't answer.  
她要么是没听到他的话，要么是忽视了他的评论，总之她没有回答。

Shinji backed out of the way slightly as she took several steps forward and then seemed to loose her balance. Expecting something of this nature to happen, Shinji took several steps forward and caught her around the waist before she was able to hit the ground. It was then that Shinji realized that large amounts of blood were flowing from her side, which apparently had a large wound.  
真嗣微微退开，她向前走了几步，随后似乎失去了平衡。预料到这种情况，真嗣快步上前，在她摔倒之前搂住了她的腰。这时真嗣才发现，大量鲜血正从她的侧腹涌出，显然那里有一个大伤口。

Shinji had a strong urge then to yell at her, to ask why the hell she was piloting that thing in her condition. He never got the words out though as he assumed she wouldn't care.  
真嗣当时强烈地想要对她大喊，问她为什么在这种状态下还要驾驶那东西。但他没有说出口，因为他认为她不会在意。

"Come on, lets get out of here."  
“来吧，我们离开这里。”

"No."

Shinji had to do a double take as he saw her looking over at the Eva Unit.  
真嗣不得不再次确认，因为他看到她正朝 EVA 机体那边看去。

With a frown on his face Shinji said, "Come on, your hurt, I don't want to be here, and those things are capable of leveling a city."  
真嗣皱着眉头说：“拜托，你受伤了，我也不想待在这里，那些东西可是能夷平一座城市的。”

"No."

Shinji was starting to get annoyed and was about to retort angrily back at the girl when she said, "The Eva, it wants you to pilot it."  
真嗣开始感到恼火，正要生气地反驳那个女孩时，她却说：“EVA，它希望你来驾驶。”

Shinji blinked twice before he understood what she was talking about. Shaking his head he said, "No, I can't."  
真嗣眨了两次眼才明白她在说什么。他摇摇头说：“不，我不能。”

"And why is that?" “为什么呢？”

"Because I..." “因为我是……”

The girl looked blankly back at him as he turned his head the other way, biting down on his lip, unsure of what to say.  
女孩茫然地回望着他，而他则转向另一边，咬着嘴唇，不知该说什么。

"I don't like it," he finally whispered.  
"我不喜欢它，"他终于低声说道。

"Why don't you like it?"  
"你为什么不喜欢它？"

"I don't know damn it!"  
“我不知道，该死！”

His outburst didn't even seemed to faze her as she looked calmly back at him. Turning towards the Eva she said, "Only you can pilot that Eva, I tried and wasn't able to."  
他的爆发似乎并未影响到她，她平静地回望着他。转向 Eva，她说道：“只有你能驾驶那台 Eva，我试过了，但做不到。”

Shinji grumbled slightly at her words. He didn't want to, hell no, but the visions. He couldn't get the damn things out of his head.  
对于她的话，真嗣小声嘀咕了一下。他并不想，绝对不想，但那些幻象。他无法将那些该死的东西从脑海中赶走。

"It's asking you to go, why don't you?"  
"它让你去，你为什么不去呢？"

Shinji maybe thought it would be worth it just to get away from this girls questions.  
真嗣可能觉得，只要能逃离这些女孩的问题，就值得一试。

Looking over at the Eva briefly he could have sworn he felt a tug on his shirt as though it was pulling him towards itself.  
他短暂地瞥了一眼 Eva，几乎可以发誓感觉到自己的衬衫被拉了一下，仿佛是在把他拉向它。

Sighing in a dejected way he said, "Do I have a choice." It wasn't a question, it was acknowledgement.  
他沮丧地叹了口气，说道：“我有选择的余地吗？”这并非疑问，而是承认。

Letting go of the girl she watched him as he slowly walked over to the Eva took a few hesitating moments and climbed in. Almost at once the entry plug resealed itself as though it had found what it wanted.  
放开女孩后，她看着他慢慢走向 Eva，犹豫片刻后爬了进去。几乎就在他进入驾驶舱的瞬间，插入栓立刻重新封闭，仿佛找到了它所需要的东西。

Inside the entry plug Shinji immediately felt the voice talking to him again.  
在插入栓内，真嗣立刻再次感受到了那个声音在对他讲话。

"_Glad to see that your back."_  
"很高兴看到你回来了。"

"Don't expect me for long."  
"别指望我会待很久。"

"_You sure? I feel like I'm getting to know you better every time you climb in. Only I know what is deep in your heart."_  
"你确定吗？每次你爬进来，我都感觉越来越了解你。只有我知道你内心深处的秘密。"

"Thats great but how about we get moving."  
"那太好了，不过我们还是动身吧。"

"_Gonna save that red Eva."_  
"要去救那个红色 Eva。"

"Something like that," Shinji mumbled.  
"差不多吧，" 真嗣咕哝道。"

Trying to remember how he had done it before he put everyone ounce of his thought it making the Eva stand up. Slowly but surely it did.  
努力回忆着之前是如何做到的，他将每一分心思都投入到让 Eva 站起来的行动中。虽然缓慢，但确实做到了。

From the right Asuka saw this and smirked into the transceivers that were built into the entry plug. "Might as well stay down first child, I'm almost done."  
从右边，明日香通过内置在插入栓中的通讯器看到了这一幕，并得意地笑了。“最好还是先躺下吧，初号机，我差不多快完成了。”

"Err, hey...Asuka." “呃，嘿...明日香。”

Silence greeted Shinji's sudden intrusion at into battle. Asuka didn't reply, whether she was glad or angry Shinji didn't find out. However in the command center of Nerv Misato was beside herself with worry when she heard Shinji's voice over the intercom.  
沉默迎接了真嗣突如其来的参战。明日香没有回应，无论是高兴还是生气，真嗣都无从得知。然而在 NERV 的指挥中心，当听到真嗣通过通讯器传来的声音时，美里担心得几乎要崩溃了。

"Shinji what the hell do you think your doing," yelled Misato straight into the entry plug. Shinji felt like his ears were going to explode.  
“真嗣，你到底在想什么？”美里对着插入栓大喊。真嗣感觉自己的耳朵都要炸了。

"Helping, I think." “我想，是在帮忙。”

"You get out this instance."  
"你这次给我出去。"

"No. I'm in and staying, for now."  
"不，我现在要留下来，暂时。"

Suddenly a new voice came over the intercom and Shinji recognized it to be his father.  
突然，一个新的声音通过对讲机传来，真嗣立刻认出那是他父亲的声音。

"Am I to understand that you wont run away this time," he said in his usual drawl.  
"我是否可以理解为，这次你不会逃跑了，"他用一贯的拖腔说道。

"I'm here until I leave, and only I decide that."  
"我会留在这里，直到我自己决定离开。"

"Nerv does not employee selfish people."  
"NERV 不会雇佣自私的人。"

'Then why the hell are you here,' Shinji felt like saying.  
“那你他妈的为什么在这里，”真嗣感觉自己想说。

Ignoring his dad and everybody else at the command center he turned to see the angel flying through the air again as Asuka had just hit it with a metal light post.  
无视他的父亲和指挥中心里的其他人，他转身看到使徒再次飞过空中，因为明日香刚刚用一根金属灯柱击中了它。

"Heh, try getting up after that you bastard."  
“哼，挨了这下看你还怎么爬起来，混蛋。”

"Asuka, I don't think thats enough to-"  
"明日香，我觉得这还不够——"

Once again she completely ignored him.  
她又一次完全无视了他。

Sighing to himself he thought he should have suspected this attitude. Likely she wanted all the glory and didn't care what his thoughts were on the matter, typical.  
他暗自叹息，心想自己早该料到这种态度。她大概只想独揽荣耀，根本不在乎他对这件事的看法，真是典型的。

"_Aren't you going to do anything?"_  
"你难道不打算做点什么吗？"

"I didn't do anything last time, you took over."  
"上次我什么都没做，是你接手的。"

"_Thats right, I had fun. All right since I had my fun I'll help you this time."_  
"没错，我玩得很开心。好吧，既然我玩够了，这次就帮你一把。"

The Eva's nerves suddenly bore into the metal of the entry plug and burst through into sea of LCL fluid were they started floating. Shinji eyed them worriedly and said, "Why are you using those things again?"  
EVA 的神经突然穿透插入栓的金属，冲入 LCL 溶液中开始漂浮。真嗣担忧地看着它们，问道：“为什么又用这些东西？”

"_I've told you its easier to sync with you, because it is particularly you."_  
“我告诉过你，与你同步更容易，正是因为你。”

"What is that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"_Something that doesn't concern you."_  
"与你无关的事。"

Without warning the nerves pierced Shinji's skin and dug into his body where they wrapped around his own nerves. Slowly blood started to leak from the wounds.  
毫无预警地，神经刺穿了真嗣的皮肤，深入他的身体，缠绕在他的神经上。慢慢地，血液开始从伤口中渗出。

"_Hmm, the mixing of the blood and LCL fluid isn't going as well as I'd hoped. Their is a shortage of the LCL fluid since you opened it earlier. Guess it can't be helped will have to rely on your blood."_  
"嗯，血液与 LCL 液体的混合并不如预期顺利。由于你之前打开过，LCL 液体不足。看来只能依靠你的血液了，没办法。"

"And what does my blood have to do with anything."  
"我的血与这一切有何关系。"

"_You ask to many questions, just sit there and watch."_  
"你问得太多了，就坐在那儿看着吧。"

Eva Unit 01 then let out a roar that shattered the windows of the buildings around it. Crouching down on all fours it dashed quickly off against the ground and hurled itself at the angel. The angel, completely focused on Unit 02 was caught of guard and sent hurling into the nearest building. Jumping up and down, Eva Unit 01 let out another loud roar as it charged at the angel again.  
随后，Eva 初号机发出一声咆哮，震碎了周围建筑的窗户。它四肢着地，迅速冲向地面，猛地扑向使徒。使徒全神贯注于二号机，猝不及防被撞进了最近的建筑。初号机跳跃着，再次发出震耳欲聋的咆哮，又一次向使徒发起冲锋。

Grabbing one of the energy whips it squeezed it quickly and broke it in a shower of blood and gore. Letting out a wounded howl the angel took several clumsy steps back only to be greet by a savage punch from Eva Unit 02.  
抓住其中一条能量鞭，它迅速挤压并将其在一阵血肉横飞中折断。天使发出受伤的嚎叫，踉跄后退几步，却迎面挨了 Eva 初号机 02 的一记猛拳。

"Take that Bastard." “接招吧，混蛋。”

Shinji was almost felt like he was in a drunken rage as he watched things unfold from inside the entry plug. He hated not knowing what to do and being at the mercy of the voice in the Eva, or what he wast starting to call the Devil.  
真嗣在插入栓内几乎感觉自己像是在醉酒般的狂怒中目睹这一切。他痛恨不知所措，任由 Eva 中的声音摆布，或者他开始称之为恶魔的存在。

As the angel backed slowly away from Tokyo-3, planning to retreat, Unit 01 quickly pounced on it and grabbed it by the neck and twisted it savagely until it broke with the sound of a battleship bombardment.  
天使缓缓后退，打算撤离东京-3，但初号机迅速扑上前去，一把抓住其颈部，猛力扭转，直至断裂声如战舰炮击般响起。

"_That was dull, I didn't even have to use berserk mode."_  
“真无聊，我连暴走模式都没用上。”

Shinji felt himself slowly blacking out as he had lost to much blood. "At least its over."  
真嗣感到自己逐渐失去意识，失血过多。“至少，一切都结束了。”

"_For now at least."_  "至少目前如此。"

---

"This constant cycle of bleeding and healing is going to affect him."  
"这种持续的流血与愈合循环会对他产生影响。"

"How bad?" "有多严重？"

"I can't say for sure but he seems to heal surprisingly quickly, which worries me since it could be a side effect of being in that Eva."  
"我不敢肯定，但他似乎恢复得异常快，这让我担心，因为这可能是驾驶那台 Eva 的副作用。"

"Do you really think its that bad."  
"你真的认为有那么糟糕吗？"

"Judging by the fact that Rei couldn't pilot it I can assure you that it's very different."  
"鉴于丽无法驾驶它这一事实，我可以向你保证，它非常不同。"

"I suppose...at least it didn't go berserk."  
"我想...至少它没有发狂。"

"No, Shinji seemed to be more in control that last time, but still far from a decent sync. At times he far out passes Asuka's records and at times he barely meets the minimum sync levels."  
"不，真嗣这次似乎更能控制自己了，但离良好的同步率还差得远。有时候他远远超过明日香的记录，有时候却勉强达到最低同步率。"

"Any ideas?" "有什么想法吗？"

"None." "没有。"

Misato sighed, "Thanks Ritsuko for all the help."  
美里叹了口气，"谢谢你，律子，帮了这么多忙。"

"No problem, he shouldn't be in any immediate danger though so when he gets up you should be able to go home."  
"没事，他应该没有立即的危险，等他醒来后你们就可以回家了。"

"Thanks again." “再次感谢。”

Ritsuko simply waived a hand as she walked out of the hospital room.  
律子只是挥了挥手，便走出了病房。

Several minutes later Shinji felt his eyes open slowly. It felt like they had been crusted shut.  
几分钟后，真嗣感到自己的眼睛缓缓睁开，感觉像是被粘住了一样。

"Shinji you're awake!" "真嗣，你醒了！"

It took Shinji several minutes to figure out who was talking then...  
真嗣花了好几分钟才弄清楚是谁在说话……

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Yeah how do you feel."  
"嗯，你感觉怎么样。"

"Sore, like I had needles drilled into me."  
"疼得像被针钻进去一样。"

"Well, you did have the Eva's nerves connected with yours."  
"嗯，你的神经确实和 Eva 的连接在一起了。"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"So ready to go home."  
"终于可以回家了。"

Shinji looked up hopefully, "I can leave."  
真嗣满怀希望地抬头，"我可以走了。"

"Yeah, nothing's wrong with you so we can leave whenever."  
"是啊，你没事了，我们随时都可以离开。"

"Okay, yeah I'm ready." "好的，是的，我准备好了。"

Shinji got out of bed and changed quickly while Misato waited by the door.  
真嗣迅速起床更衣，美里则在门口等候。

"All ready then?" "那么，都准备好了吗？"

Shinji nodded. 真嗣点了点头。

"Good, I'm sure Asuka is wanting food right about now."  
"好，我相信明日香现在一定饿了。"

Shinji felt a little sweat dripped from his chin then. He had forgotten about Asuka.  
真嗣感到一滴汗珠从下巴滴落。他忘了明日香。

---

Shinji had thought that he had finally gotten used to Misato's driving but he had to look back at the drive home as he walked into the apartment clutching his stomach.  
真嗣本以为自己终于习惯了美里开车的方式，但当他走进公寓，手捂着肚子时，不得不回想回家的那段车程。

"About time," said an angry voice.  
“终于回来了，”一个愤怒的声音说道。

Shinji looked up to see Asuka in short blue shorts and a pink tank-top standing in front of the door with her foot tapping impatiently.  
真嗣抬头一看，只见明日香穿着蓝色短裤和粉色背心，站在门前，不耐烦地用脚敲打着地面。

"Do you have any idea how hungry I've gotten waiting for you."  
"你知道我等你等得有多饿吗？"

"Gomen Asuka, I didn't want to wake Shinji up."  
"对不起，明日香，我不想吵醒真嗣。"

"Whatever I want something for dinner, now."  
"无所谓，我现在想吃晚饭了。"

Even though she still hadn't said anything to him since she left earlier or looked at him for that matter, he took this as an indirect way of asking him to make dinner.  
尽管她自从早些时候离开后还没对他说过任何话，甚至也没看他一眼，但他把这当作是间接让他准备晚餐的请求。

"Yeah, I'll get right on it."  
“好的，我马上就去弄。”

"But Shinji you just got out of the hospital, surely-"  
“但是真嗣，你刚出院，肯定——”

"Its fine Misato." “没事的，美里。”

Asuka meanwhile had retreated to the couch and turned on the T.V. and turned the volume up so she couldn't here Shinji whistling in the kitchen.  
与此同时，明日香已经退到沙发上，打开了电视，并把音量调高，这样她就听不到真嗣在厨房里吹口哨的声音了。

It was probably the first time since they all three started to live together that not a word was spoken at the dinner table. Shinji for the most part kept to himself and only talked when addressed, but Asuka and Misato talked a lot. Not today.  
自从他们三人开始同居以来，这可能是第一次晚餐桌上没有一个人说话。真嗣大部分时间都保持沉默，只在被问到时才开口，但明日香和美里通常话很多。今天却不同。

The air itself seemed to be unsocial and half way through dinner Asuka couldn't take any more of it and stood up, planting both palms on the table, and walked over to the living room with her half eaten plate.  
空气中似乎弥漫着不和谐的气息，晚餐进行到一半时，明日香再也忍受不了，猛地站起身来，双手撑在桌上，端着只吃了一半的盘子走向客厅。

When Asuka finally left Shinji stopped playing with his food and asked Misato. "Err, is she angry that I killed he angel and not her?"  
当明日香终于离开后，真嗣停止了玩弄食物，向美里问道：“呃，她是不是因为我杀了使徒而不是她而生气？”

Misato shrugged, "No idea."  
美里耸了耸肩，“不知道。”

Sighing Shinji pushed his half eaten plate of food away from himself and walked into the living room.  
叹了口气，真嗣将只吃了一半的盘子推开，走进了客厅。

Predictably Asuka was watching something in German and taking up the whole couch. Shinji stood there for several seconds, listening to whatever she was watching and was about to turn around when a harsh voice said, "What do you want?"  
不出所料，明日香正在看德语节目，占据了整个沙发。真嗣站在那里几秒钟，听着她正在看的内容，正要转身离开时，一个严厉的声音问道：“你想要什么？”

Shinji looked over his shoulder to see Asuka still looking at the T.V. even though she had just asked him a question.  
真嗣回头一看，只见明日香仍然盯着电视，尽管她刚刚问了他一个问题。

Shaking his head he said, "Why are you mad at me."  
他摇摇头说：“你为什么生我的气？”

"Because you're a baka, plain and simple."  
“因为你就是个笨蛋，简单明了。”

"You tell me I'm an idiot at least twice a day, if not more, its something more important than that."  
“你每天至少两次说我是个白痴，如果不是更多的话，这次是比这更严重的事。”

"Fine then, I'm angry that you left the house and then started fighting the angel without giving a thought about it."  
"好吧，我生气了，你离开家后就开始和天使战斗，根本没考虑过后果。"

"Asuka I didn't have a choice, it just happened in front of me. It's not like I wanted that to happen."  
"明日香，我别无选择，它就发生在我面前。又不是我想要这样的。"

"Baka!" "笨蛋！"

"Whatever, be that way. You're too stubborn as it is."  
“随你怎么说，你本来就固执得要命。”

As Shinji turned away he heard the shifting of something and next second heard a crash as something exploded over his head.  
当真嗣转身离开时，他听到了什么东西移动的声音，下一秒就听到头顶上传来爆炸声。

Being careful not to step on the broken plate he turned around to see a red faced, angry Asuka glaring poisonously back at him.  
他小心翼翼地避开破碎的盘子，转过身来，看到满脸通红、怒气冲冲的明日香正恶狠狠地瞪着他。

"DON'T YOU DARE ACT LIKE YOUR THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN-" Asuka got a hold of her feeling then as she realized that she'd be making herself vulnerable.  
"你敢装作只有你一个人在受苦——" 明日香控制住了自己的情绪，随即意识到自己正变得脆弱。

Shinji meanwhile was looking curiously back at her, unsure what to make of this sudden outburst and subsequent retreat.  
与此同时，真嗣好奇地回头看着她，不明白这突如其来的爆发和随后的退缩意味着什么。

"If it makes you feel any better I'm sorry, for whatever I did. Now I'm going to bed, night."  
"如果这能让你感觉好些，我道歉，无论我做了什么。现在我要去睡觉了，晚安。"

Shinji then turned and walked down the hall leaving Asuka alone in the living room. Biting her lip slightly she slumped back down into the couch cushions and thought, 'Sorry, you could have died. Baka!'  
真嗣随后转身沿着走廊走去，留下明日香一人在客厅。她轻轻咬着嘴唇，又瘫坐在沙发垫上，心想：‘对不起，你本可能死掉的。笨蛋！’

### Chapter 5: Understanding  
第五章：理解  

**Well as I said I'd get this done a lot earlier then the last four month wait time...and here it is. I think this is the shortest chapter I've done so far for Spawn of Adam, though they wont get shorter than this. Anyway I'm going to yellowstone for ten days and they've got internet there. So hopefully I'll get some typing done while there. Also something I forgot to mention in the last chapter, I made a ShinjiXAsuka amv and put it on youtube. I originally made it back in January but only got around to posting it last month. So if you like Breaking Benjamin (song is Diary of Jane) then you'll probably like this. Ja Ne  
正如我所说，我会比上次四个月的等待时间提前完成这个章节……现在它来了。我认为这是迄今为止《亚当之子》中最短的一章，尽管不会再比这更短了。无论如何，我将去黄石公园十天，那里有互联网。所以希望在那里我能完成一些打字工作。另外，我在上一章忘记提到，我制作了一个真嗣 X 明日香的视频并上传到了 YouTube。我原本在一月份就制作好了，但直到上个月才发布。所以如果你喜欢 Breaking Benjamin（歌曲是《简的日记》），那么你可能会喜欢这个。再见**

---

"Get up, and make our lunches," said an angry voice from his door.  
“起床，给我们准备午餐，”一个愤怒的声音从他的门口传来。

Shinji rolled over and grumbled about it being to early before Asuka planted her bare foot directly on his face.  
真嗣翻了个身，咕哝着说时间还太早，结果明日香直接把她的赤脚踩在了他的脸上。

"Move it! You better not expect me to eat that shit they call food at school."  
快点！你最好别指望我吃学校里那些他们称之为食物的垃圾。

Pushing Asuka's foot off his face he glared at her briefly before resigning to her demands. Looked like she was still angry.  
他推开明日香的脚，短暂地瞪了她一眼，然后无奈地接受了她的要求。看来她还在生气。

Standing up quickly he pushed passed her and walked into the kitchen to start making their bento's. Shinji was somewhat surprised though that she didn't wake him up earlier to make breakfast. Though judging from the bowl of half eaten cereal on the kitchen table she wasn't particularly hungry.  
他迅速站起身，推开她走进厨房开始准备便当。这让真嗣有些惊讶，她竟然没有早点叫醒他做早餐。不过从厨房桌上那碗只吃了一半的麦片来看，她似乎并不怎么饿。

Sighing slightly, he turned towards the fridge and started assembling all the ingredients for the bento's.  
他轻轻叹了口气，转向冰箱，开始组装便当所需的所有食材。

Half an hour later, the two of them walked out the door with Asuka maintaing several yards in front Shinji. He didn't seem to mind it really though, if anything he was avoiding her as much as possible.  
半小时后，两人一前一后走出门，明日香保持着几码的距离走在真嗣前面。他似乎并不介意，甚至可以说，他尽可能地避免与她接触。

The day before, when Misato returned from Nerv, Shinji was told that if he continued to fight the angels then he would have to run tests while in the Eva. He wasn't thrilled by this but expected it nonetheless. Asuka seemed furious though and this seemed to just build on top of her new hate for Shinji. So after a hectic yelling match between the two she had hit him...hard, and stormed back to her room. So Shinji would only be more than happy to be able to ignore her for the rest of the day. Though that didn't seem to be the case as a sudden bout of nausea hit him and he felt his vision grow blurry until he passed out.  
前一天，当美里从 NERV 回来时，真嗣被告知如果他继续与使徒战斗，那么他必须在 EVA 中进行测试。他对此并不兴奋，但仍然有所预料。然而，明日香似乎非常愤怒，这似乎加剧了她对真嗣的新恨意。于是在两人之间爆发了一场激烈的争吵后，她狠狠地打了真嗣一拳，然后怒气冲冲地回到自己的房间。因此，真嗣非常乐意能在当天剩下的时间里无视她。然而，这似乎并不可能，因为他突然感到一阵恶心，视线变得模糊，直到他昏倒。

---

'Really this is starting to get annoying,' he thought to himself as he watched himself walking out the door of Misato's apartment with Asuka slightly in the lead. It was a replay of what had just happened to him. He watch from above as two of them walked, with her always slightly in the lead.  
“真的，这开始变得烦人了，”他一边看着自己走出美里公寓的门，明日香稍稍领先，一边心想。这是刚刚发生在他身上的事情的重演。他从上方看着两人行走，她总是稍稍领先。

After several minutes of this he was starting to get bored when everything changed. It looked like he was watching an extremely sped up tape on a VCR. He watched as he entered school and spent most of the time slouching in his chair with his eyes half open, glancing out the window occasionally.  
经过几分钟这样的情景，他开始感到无聊，直到一切都发生了变化。仿佛在观看一台 VCR 上极度加速的录像带。他看到自己走进学校，大部分时间都懒散地坐在椅子上，眼睛半睁，偶尔瞥向窗外。

Next they were walking out of the doors to school and seemed to be on their way to the Nerv testing facilities. Except that somebody else was with them. Shinji couldn't tell who it was though and this puzzled him. It was like a gray human like shape was walking in between him and Asuka. Why bother showing the gray shape if he couldn't even see the person. At least he thought it was a person.  
接着，他们走出学校大门，似乎正前往 NERV 的测试设施。只是，有另一个人和他们在一起。真嗣看不清是谁，这让他感到困惑。一个灰色的类人形身影走在他和明日香之间。既然他连那个人都看不清，为什么还要展示这个灰色身影呢？至少他认为那是个人的形状。

When they arrived at Nerv a security personal paused from a moment to check their idea and then let them through. After that Shinji got brief flashes of things that happened in the facilities. He saw as he changed in what Misato had called a plug suit. It seemed to be black, blue and white. He saw himself taking a deep breath before walking into the entry plug of Eva Unit 01. He saw all three of the Evas lined up, including the blue and orange one.  
到达 NERV 时，一名安保人员停顿片刻检查他们的身份，然后放行。之后，真嗣短暂地看到了设施内发生的一些事情。他看到自己换上了美里所说的插入栓服，似乎是黑、蓝、白三色。他看到自己深吸一口气，走进了 EVA 初号机的插入栓。他看到三台 EVA 并排站立，包括那台蓝橙相间的机体。

After that almost nothing. He saw a few brief flashes of things that happened afterwards. It looked like him and Asuka had another fight and he was left standing in the road with a red mark on his cheek. After this everything went blurry and he suddenly felt himself falling, and falling into nothingness.  
自那之后，几乎一片空白。他瞥见了几幕后续的片段。似乎是他和明日香又吵了一架，他独自站在路上，脸颊上留着一道红印。此后一切变得模糊，他突然感到自己在坠落，坠入无尽的虚空。

---

"Wake up, damn it!" “快醒醒，该死的！”

Shinji felt somebody hitting him hard at the side of his head and opened his eyes slowly, just as Asuka was about the backhand him again.  
真嗣感到有人重重地击打他的头部一侧，他缓缓睁开眼睛，正好看到明日香准备再次反手打他。

It was curious how he reacted. Before her hand was about to strike him he caught it with surprising speed that he didn't even know he possessed. With a glazed look over his eyes as though he was stilling falling through the blackness he looked up at Asuka. It was hard to tell what her expression was, most of it seemed to be angry but Shinji thought he sensed a tiny bit of worry, though he didn't expect her to say it in words.  
他的反应颇为耐人寻味。在她即将打中他之前，他以惊人的速度抓住了她的手，连他自己都没想到能有这样的反应。他的眼神迷离，仿佛仍在那片黑暗中坠落，他抬头看向明日香。很难判断她的表情，大部分似乎是愤怒，但真嗣觉得他察觉到了一丝担忧，尽管他不指望她会用言语表达出来。

"Let go of me ass-hole."  
“放开我，混蛋。”

Wrenching her hand out of his grip she glared at him slightly before snarling. "What the fuck was that about?"  
她用力挣脱他的手，稍稍瞪了他一眼，随即咆哮道：“你他妈刚才那是什么意思？”

Shinji would have dearly liked to retort back something similar but kept his cool and said. "Nothing, just anticipation for today's tests."  
真嗣本想狠狠回敬一句，但还是保持了冷静，说道：“没什么，只是对今天的测试有些期待。”

"No amount of tests will improve you, baka."  
“再多的测试也改变不了你，笨蛋。”

Shinji ignored her comment, stood up calmly, and grabbed his bag which lay discarded on the sidewalk. Turning around briefly he glanced at Asuka briefly who seemed somewhere torn between loathing and spite, which didn't make a difference in Shinji's opinion.  
真嗣无视了她的评论，平静地站起身，拿起被丢在人行道上的书包。他转头短暂地瞥了一眼明日香，她似乎在厌恶和怨恨之间挣扎，但在真嗣看来，这并没有什么区别。

Turning back around he started walking forward at a slow pace when he felt something hard hit his shoulder and a flash of red moved past him. Rubbing his shoulder where she had punched him he looked ahead and was unsurprised that she had widened the distance between them.  
他转过身，开始以缓慢的步伐前行，忽然感到有什么硬物击中了他的肩膀，一道红影从他身边掠过。他揉着被她打中的肩膀，抬头望向前方，对于她拉大了彼此间的距离并不感到意外。

"Does she always have to act so superior to everyone?" He mumbled before walking at the same pace that he had been moving at moments before.  
“她总是要表现得比所有人都高人一等吗？”他低声嘀咕着，继续保持着之前那段时间的步伐。

---

School was still a nightmare but one thing seemed to have changed. Kensuke seemed to respect Shinji a little because of what he said at the shelters. Even Touji didn't seem like a jerk as much, but he kept up with it mainly because everyone else did.  
学校依旧如噩梦般，但似乎有一件事发生了变化。因为他在避难所说的话，健介似乎对真嗣多了几分尊重。就连东治也不再那么像个混蛋了，不过他主要还是因为大家都这么做而继续保持。

When Shinji walked into class that day he was unsurprised to see Asuka already sitting in front of his desk looking determinedly out the window. Ignoring this he walked over to his desk and was about to sit down when he stopped in the middle of sitting. Next to Asuka was a girl with blue hair, the same from the day before.  
那天，当真嗣走进教室时，看到明日香已经坐在他的桌前，坚定地望着窗外，他并不感到意外。他无视这一点，走到自己的桌前，正要坐下时，却在半空中停住了。在明日香旁边，有一个蓝头发的女孩，正是前一天见过的那位。

She gave no inclination that she recognized Shinji, in fact, from his view, she seemed to not even know where she was. A vague, blank expression was on her face as she continued staring at the chalk bored. Shinji noticed, without perverted intentions, that she seemed to be holding herself different, as though she was in discomfort. Then he remembered the large wound that she had suffered and was about to open his mouth when a slight snarl came from across the room.  
她没有表现出任何认出真嗣的迹象，实际上，从他的角度看，她似乎连自己在哪里都不知道。她的脸上带着一种模糊而空洞的表情，继续盯着黑板。真嗣注意到，没有不正当的意图，她似乎在以不同的方式支撑着自己，仿佛感到不适。然后他想起了她所受的重伤，正要开口时，教室另一边传来了一声轻微的咆哮。

"Shinji, are you going to stand there forever or can you sit so I can get on with teaching."  
“真嗣，你是打算一直站在那里，还是能坐下来让我继续上课？”

Several of the kids snickered as Shinji threw his teacher a scowl and sat behind Asuka who at that moment didn't know who she hated more: Shinji or the First Child.  
有几个孩子窃笑起来，真嗣瞪了老师一眼，坐在了明日香后面，那一刻她不知道自己更恨谁：真嗣还是第一适任者。

While school was still something he loathed he found it easier to get through the day. He even started to attracted less unpleasant remarks from the other students, which he thought might have a lot to do with living with Asuka. Seemed many of the boys had finally found out what she was really like and lost interest in her, which seemed to annoy her. After all her complaining about every guy wanting to get in bed with her she was getting annoyed by the lack of attention. Shinji then snorted at the thought of this as he sat down up on the school roof. Classes had just been dismissed for lunch and Shinji didn't have an appetite right now. Last thing he needed was to hurl during his first test.  
尽管学校依然是他所厌恶的地方，但他发现日子变得容易熬过去了。他甚至开始少受其他学生的恶言恶语，他认为这可能与和明日香同住有很大关系。似乎许多男生终于发现了她的真面目，对她失去了兴趣，这似乎让她很恼火。毕竟，她一直在抱怨每个男人都想和她上床，而现在她却因为缺乏关注而感到恼火。真嗣想到这里，嗤之以鼻，他坐在学校屋顶上。刚放学去吃午饭，真嗣现在没有胃口。他最不需要的就是在第一次考试中呕吐。

After several minutes of laying there Shinji thought that he could hear two distinct voices coming up the stairwell. Sitting up just in time he saw the door flung open and bounce off against the wall only to be kicked again. Touji walked disgruntled out into the open with a slight tense Kensuke behind him.  
躺了几分钟后，真嗣觉得他能听到楼梯间传来两个不同的声音。他及时坐起来，看到门被猛地推开，撞到墙上又被踢了一脚。东治一脸不悦地走了出来，紧随其后的是略显紧张的健介。

'So much for peace and quiet,' thought Shinji.  
“看来平静的日子是没戏了，”真嗣心想。

Surprisingly though they didn't seem to want to pick on him as Kensuke walked up to Shinji and said rather hurriedly.  
然而出乎意料的是，他们似乎并不想找他麻烦，健介快步走向真嗣，急匆匆地说道。

"Hey...umm, I'm sorry for everything that I...we've ever done to you." Touji acted as though he wasn't listening. Kensuke continued.  
“嘿...呃，对于我们对你做过的所有事情，我...我们感到很抱歉。” 透治表现得好像没在听一样。健介继续说道。

"And I was just hoping that we could put our past differences aside and well..." Kensuke then put out his hand in front of Shinji and gave something close to a bow.  
"我刚才只是希望我们能放下过去的分歧，嗯……" 随后， Kensuke 伸出手，向真嗣微微鞠了一躬。

Shinji wasn't sure whether to laugh, rebuke him, or shake his hand. Never being good any stuff like this he scratched the back of his head and said, "Oh...yeah." Grabbing his hand rather uncertain of himself he shook Kensuke's hand who responded by sitting down next to Shinji and opening his lunch box.  
真嗣不确定是该笑，还是该责备他，或是握手。对于这种事情他一向不擅长，于是挠了挠后脑勺，说："哦……嗯。" 他有些犹豫地握住了 Kensuke 的手，而 Kensuke 则顺势坐在真嗣旁边，打开了便当盒。

"Want some?" "要来点吗？"

Shinji shook his head, "Best not to."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"最好别这样。"

Kensuke shrugged and went back to eating. It appeared that even Touji's still apparent annoyance of Shinji could not even deter him from eating as he sat down next to Kensuke and plowed into his own lunch. Even though Shinji didn't want to admit it he was glad that he had finally made a friend, well there was Asuka, but that varied.  
健介耸了耸肩，继续吃他的饭。看来，即使是对真嗣依然明显的恼怒，也无法阻止他吃饭。他坐在健介旁边，大口吃着自己的午餐。虽然真嗣不想承认，但他很高兴自己终于交到了一个朋友，嗯，还有明日香，但那关系时好时坏。

"Hey Shinji I was wondering," said Kensuke between bites.  
"嘿，真嗣，我在想，"健介边吃边说。

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"What happened to you after we left you at that shelter."  
"我们把你留在那个收容所后，你发生了什么事？"

Its a good thing that Shinji wasn't eating anything or he would have just gone into a choking fit. This was the least thing that he expected Kensuke to ask. Stuttering slightly he said, "Oh I wandered around before I found a shelter."  
幸好真嗣没在吃东西，否则他可能会呛到。这是他最没想到健介会问的问题。他稍微结巴了一下，说道：“哦，我四处流浪了一阵子，然后找到了一个避难所。”

"Did you here about the rumor that have been going around town lately?"  
"你听说了最近城里流传的那些谣言吗？"

"Err what rumors?" Shinji had an idea but wasn't about to say it.  
"什么谣言？" 真嗣心里有数，但并不打算说出来。

"That underneath Tokyo-3 is a secret military organization and that it conducted a test yesterday. Thats why the city had to be under isolation."  
"说东京-3 地下有一个秘密军事组织，昨天进行了测试。这就是为什么城市必须处于隔离状态。"

Shinji let out a sigh of relief.  
真嗣松了一口气。

"And that they supposedly tested some giant robot."  
"据说他们测试了某种巨型机器人。"

Shinji sigh seemed to be sucked back in as Kensuke's words hit his ears. "Err, know. I didn't hear that," he said sheepishly.  
听到 Kensuke 的话，Shinji 的叹息仿佛被吸了回去。“呃，不知道。我没听说过，”他有些尴尬地说。

"It seems to be a big story, I just wonder how much is true. Oh what I would give to get a picture of one."  
"这听起来像是个大新闻，我只是好奇有多少是真的。哦，要是我能拍到一张照片就好了。"

Shinji thought it was time to steer the conversation away from dangerous waters and said quiet bluntly without meaning to. "Who is that blue haired girl that just showed up today?"  
真嗣觉得是时候把话题从危险的水域引开了，于是不经意间直截了当地问道：“今天刚来的那个蓝发女孩是谁？”

Kensuke looked puzzled for a minute before snickering slightly and smiling at Shinji. "I thought I caught you looking at her, what outgrew Asuka already?"  
剑介困惑了一会儿，随即轻笑起来，对着真嗣微笑道：“我就知道你注意到她了，这么快就对明日香没兴趣了？”

Shinji was slightly annoyed, more for the fact of suggesting him and Asuka having sex then him interested in the blue haired girl.  
真嗣有些不悦，更多的是因为剑介暗示他和明日香有性关系，而不是他对蓝发女孩感兴趣。

Passing it off he said, "I'd never live through it. No I was just curious is all. I've been here for almost a month now and I just noticed her today. Has she been here always?"  
他推脱道：“我可受不了那种事。不，我只是好奇罢了。我在这里已经快一个月了，今天才注意到她。她一直都在这儿吗？”

Kensuke shrugged, "Yeah but she seems to disappear for a while and then just comes back one day. Sometimes she's injured, other times she's fine. No idea what's up with her. She keeps to herself and hardly talks to anyone."  
健助耸了耸肩，“是啊，但她似乎会消失一段时间，然后某天又突然回来。有时她受伤了，有时又安然无恙。不知道她怎么回事。她总是独来独往，几乎不和任何人说话。”

"So what's her name then?"  
“那她叫什么名字？”

"Err...Ayanami Rei, I think."  
"呃...我想是绫波零。"

"Ayanami Rei?" "绫波零？"

"Yeah, its the first time I can remember seeing her in a few months."  
"是啊，这是我这几个月来第一次记得见到她。"

Shinji couldn't think of anything to say at this point and lapsed into silence. So her name was Ayanami Rei and she was also an Eva pilot. Chances are then that he'd see her later again.  
此时，真嗣想不出该说什么，便陷入了沉默。原来她的名字是绫波零，也是一位 EVA 驾驶员。那么，他很可能会再次见到她。

Kensuke appeared to be done with his lunch and Touji had finished his in record time. Standing up Kensuke said, "I guess I'll see you in class then, Shinji."  
健司似乎已经吃完了午餐，而阿薰更是以创纪录的速度解决了他的那份。站起来后，健司说道：“那我们课堂上见，真嗣。”

"Yeah cya," said Shinji who was absorbed in his own thoughts.  
“嗯，再见。”真嗣沉浸在自己的思绪中，随口应道。

After the two stooges left Shinji flung himself on his back as he looked up at the clouds. Reflecting back on what had happened the past week his life had definitely taken a turn, but in which direction. Compared to what it used to be he supposed that it was better. He had a decent home with a nice roommate...and a not so nice roommate, well usually. And he had started to get used to peoples company.  
在两个笨蛋离开后，真嗣仰面躺下，望着天上的云朵。回想起过去一周发生的事情，他的生活无疑发生了转变，但转向何方呢？与过去相比，他觉得现在好多了。他有了一个不错的家，和一个好室友……以及一个不那么好的室友，嗯，通常情况下。而且，他开始习惯了与人相处。

Though everything bad that he had seen, the Eva, angels, the visions, the damn visions. What in the hell we're they really? Premonitions about the future, or events that may or might not happen, and why him? What did he do to make this happen to himself? A book certainly couldn't tell Shinji what he wanted to know.  
尽管他看到了所有糟糕的事情，EVA、使徒、那些该死的幻象。它们到底是什么鬼东西？关于未来的预感，还是可能发生或不发生的事件，为什么是他？他做了什么让自己遭遇这些？一本书当然无法告诉真嗣他想知道的。

Then there was Eva Unit 01, his Eva he supposed, as it wouldn't let anyone else pilot it but him. It was obviously different then the other Eva's but in what way. Did the others hear a voice every time they got in that entry plug? Did they connect physically and mentally with the Eva every time they piloted it? Shinji rather doubted it.  
还有 EVA 初号机，他觉得那是他的 EVA，因为它只允许他一个人驾驶。它显然与其他 EVA 不同，但具体是哪里不同呢？其他人每次进入驾驶舱时也会听到声音吗？他们每次驾驶时都能与 EVA 在身体和精神上建立联系吗？真嗣对此相当怀疑。

"To many questions," he mumbled out loud to nobody but himself. Or at least he thought.  
“太多问题了，”他喃喃自语，除了自己别无他人。或者至少他是这么认为的。

"Does it hurt," asked a calm voice?  
“疼吗？”一个平静的声音问道。

Shinji almost had a heart attack as he bolted upright. Standing several feet in front of him was Ayanami Rei and once again she had a passive look on her face.  
真嗣差点吓得心脏停跳，猛地坐直了身子。站在他几英尺外的是绫波零，她的脸上再次露出了那种淡漠的表情。

Shinji gaped openly for a second or to and then closed his mouth. He had an urge to say something funny but couldn't quite get his tongue to wrap around them.  
真嗣张口结舌了一会儿，然后才闭上了嘴。他有种想说些俏皮话的冲动，但舌头就是不听使唤。

"Hey what's up?" He asked in a feeble attempted at a conversation.  
“嘿，怎么了？”他试图展开对话，语气却显得无力。

She continued to look passively back at him without any sign of emotion. Shinji was starting to get annoyed.  
她继续面无表情地看着他，没有任何情绪的迹象。真嗣开始感到烦躁。

Sitting up he said, "Look, if you don't have anything to say then I'm heading back to class."  
他坐起身来说道：“听着，如果你没什么要说的，那我就回教室了。”

Shinji then pushed himself up and walked past her. At first he thought that she was going to stop him and he hesitated for a fraction of a second, but then continued walking past her. However when he was about to reach for the door nob to take him to the stairwell she finally opened up.  
随后，真嗣站起身来，从她身边走过。起初他以为她会拦住他，犹豫了那么一瞬间，但随即继续向前走去。然而，当他伸手准备开门去楼梯间时，她终于开口了。

"Are you going to continued piloting Eva?"  
“你还会继续驾驶 EVA 吗？”

Shinji wheeled around and was unsurprised to see that she still hadn't moved but was still standing in the same place, as though he had never moved. He was starting to get used to her weirdness.  
真嗣转过身来，并不意外地发现她依旧站在原地，仿佛他从未移动过。他开始习惯了她的古怪。

Wrenching open the door he paused in front of it and said, "Yeah."  
他用力拉开那扇门，在门前停顿了一下，说道：“嗯。”

Glancing briefly at her he didn't see any sign of change and let out a sigh. Had he been expecting something? Ignoring the thought he started walking back towards class.  
他匆匆瞥了她一眼，没发现任何变化，便叹了口气。他是否期待着什么？他没去多想，开始往教室走去。

The minute that Shinji walked into class Asuka threw him a dirty scowl, which he saw but ignored it. She could be so childish sometimes. However several seconds later her scowl intensified, as Shinji was walking back towards his desk, when Rei walked into the classroom. Asuka's imagination started to buzz rapidly as she thought of reasons why they were mere moments apart from walking into the class room. None of the conclusions she came up with satisfied her.  
真嗣一走进教室，明日香就朝他投去一个厌恶的眼神，他看到了却置之不理。她有时真是幼稚得可以。然而几秒钟后，她的怒容愈发加深，因为真嗣正走向自己的座位时，丽走进了教室。明日香的思绪开始飞速旋转，她想找出他们前后脚进教室的原因。但她想到的任何结论都无法令自己满意。

---

Many hour later school ended and Shinji was almost grateful, or would have been if he didn't have to climb into an Eva.  
许多小时后，学校终于放学了，真嗣几乎感到庆幸，如果不是还得爬进 Eva 的话，他本该如此。

The walk to Nerv was uneventful to say the least. He was right in assuming that Rei was a regular Eva pilot as she seemed to be going the same way as he and Asuka. Though it seemed that Asuka was determined that she was the leader as she continued to speed up every once in a while.  
前往 NERV 的步行至少可以说是不出所料的平静。他猜对了，丽确实是一名常规 Eva 驾驶员，因为她似乎和真嗣及明日香走的是同一条路。尽管明日香似乎决心要当领头人，时不时地加快步伐。

Shinji was nervous and it showed. His eyebrows were sweating and he was starting to bite his lip. He had a sudden urge then to ask Asuka some things about the tests that he would be going through soon. Speeding up, he was still determined though to stand far enough back so that he would be able to avoid a punch from her if she got angry. Still unsure if this was even smart he opened his mouth and said, "Hey Asuka can I ask you something?"  
真嗣显得很紧张，这一点显而易见。他的眉头冒着汗，开始咬起了嘴唇。他突然有种冲动，想向明日香询问一些关于即将进行的测试的事情。他加快了脚步，但仍决心保持足够的距离，以防她生气时能避开她的拳头。尽管不确定这样做是否明智，他还是张开嘴说道：“嘿，明日香，我能问你点事吗？”

She ignored him like he thought. It was worth a shot, but he still had an idea.  
她像他预想的那样无视了他。虽然值得一试，但他还有个主意。

Laying the respect on a bit thick he said, "Asuka please, you've been doing this a lot longer than I have. I want to know what to expect from these tests since you've had much more experience than I have."  
他略显夸张地表达着敬意，说道：“明日香，请告诉我，你比我有更长的经验。我想知道这些测试会有什么，毕竟你比我经验丰富得多。”

Shinji was counting on Asuka's pride as an Eva pilot that she would answer his questions. It seemed to work.  
真嗣寄希望于明日香作为 EVA 驾驶员的骄傲，相信她会回答他的问题。看来这招奏效了。

She glanced behind at him quickly with a frown on her face as though still unsure if she was angry at him or not. 'Oh what the hell. I do have the best combat record,' she thought.  
她迅速回头瞥了他一眼，眉头紧皱，似乎还在犹豫自己是否还在生他的气。'管他呢，我的战斗记录可是最好的，'她心想。

"The tests are simple enough, at least most of them. Today will be nothing more than a synchronization test."  
“这些测试很简单，至少大部分是。今天不过是同步率测试而已。”

"And what does that mean?" Shinji didn't want to ask to much and anger her so he thought to ask the basics only.  
"那是什么意思？" 真嗣不想问得太多而激怒她，所以他只问了最基本的问题。

"For an idiot like you it means nothing more than becoming used to being in the entry plug."  
"对你这样的傻瓜来说，这不过意味着习惯了进入插入栓而已。"

Shinji wanted to throw back a retort but thought better and bit his tongue, at least they were talking now.  
真嗣本想反驳，但转念一想还是咬住了舌头，至少现在他们开始交谈了。

"So we won't be doing any simulations?"  
"所以我们不进行任何模拟训练吗？"

"No! You won't be for a while. You're barely able to synchronize with your Eva. It'll take you months to get to the level that I'm at."  
"不！你暂时不会进行。你与 Eva 的同步率还很低。要达到我现在的水平，你需要几个月的时间。"

"And what about Rei?" "那丽怎么样？"

Asuka's mood turned sour at her name and spun around and Shinji was glad that he had maintained a good distance between them as she looked like she was ready to hit him.  
听到自己的名字，明日香的心情顿时变糟，她转过身来，真嗣庆幸自己和她保持了足够的距离，因为她看起来像是要揍他。

"What about her!" “她怎么了！”

"Nothing, I just wondered how long she had been a pilot is all."  
“没什么，我只是好奇她当驾驶员多久了。”

Asuka glared at him before turning around and stomping off, "Ask her yourself you dumb ass!"  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后转身跺脚离去，“你自己问她啊，你这个笨蛋！”

Shinji was left standing still on the sidewalk with a frown on his face. 'So much for the brief minutes of talking,' he thought before catching up to her slightly.  
真嗣站在人行道上，眉头紧锁。‘短暂的交谈就这样结束了，’他想着，然后稍微加快脚步追上了她。

Shinji was thoroughly glad that he had Asuka and Rei with him, he would never be able to find his way in Nerv. All the crisscrossing hallways made him nauseous. Then he remembered that his father was somewhere in this mess and felt like puking even more.  
真嗣非常庆幸有明日香和绫波在他身边，否则他绝对无法在 NERV 里找到路。那些纵横交错的走廊让他感到恶心。接着他想起父亲也在这片混乱之中，更觉得想吐了。

---

After what seemed like an hour they walked into a room similar to the one that Shinji had been in previously. Except this one had a window that showed the three Eva's lined up next to each other waiting for there pilots. Shinji guess that this is where they would be syncing. Next second it was confirmed when he heard a familiar voice.  
仿佛过了一个小时，他们走进了一个与之前真嗣待过的类似的房间。只是这个房间有一扇窗户，窗外排列着三台 EVA，它们并排等待着各自的驾驶员。真嗣猜测这里就是他们进行同步的地方。下一秒，这个猜测就被一个熟悉的声音证实了。

"Glad you could make it Shinji."  
“很高兴你能来，真嗣。”

Shinji turned around to see a smiling Misato standing in front of him.  
真嗣转过身，看到米萨托站在他面前，面带微笑。

Shinji grinned, but it was rather strained. Misato seemed to notice this and said, "Don't worry you'll be fine."  
真嗣勉强笑了笑，但显得有些僵硬。美里似乎注意到了这一点，说道：“别担心，你会没事的。”

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"Everything is ready so just go change into your plug suits and we can get this over with."  
“一切都准备好了，快去换上插入栓服，我们尽快搞定这件事。”

Asuka and Rei seemed to understand her words because they left through a door to the left leaving Shinji standing there confused.  
明日香和绫波似乎理解了她的意思，因为他们穿过左边的一扇门离开了，留下真嗣站在那里一脸困惑。

"Err Misato, what do you mean by plug suits?"  
"Misato 小姐，你说的插入栓服是什么意思？"

Misato let out a small oh as if she had forgotten something, which she did. "I completely forgot that you haven't even piloted in a plug suit before which is surprising. It shows your potential as a pilot."  
Misato 轻声‘哦’了一下，仿佛忘记了什么，她的确忘了。“我完全忘了你之前连插入栓服都没穿过，这真是令人惊讶。这显示了你作为驾驶员的潜力。”

Shinji wasn't sure that was a complement or not so just let her continue.  
真嗣不确定这是不是在夸他，所以只是让她继续说下去。

"Anyway take that door at your right in the far corner and find a locker that says Shinji on it. I think the number was 203, or something."  
“总之，走到右边的角落，那扇门进去，找一个标有‘真嗣’的储物柜。我想号码是 203，或者是别的什么。”

"But what is a plug suit?"  
“但什么是插入栓服？”

Misato frowned, "I knew that you and Asuka hadn't been getting along but I assumed that she'd explain some things to you."  
美里皱眉道：“我知道你和明日香相处得不好，但我以为她会向你解释一些事情。”

"I really hadn't tried, its better to let her cool off instead of forcing her to."  
"我真的没试过，让她冷静一下比强迫她要好。"

"Well, anyway, in simple terms the plug suit synchronizes you with your Eva. However the fact that you are able to sync with your Eva...by other methods means that maybe you wont have to use one. This is still all just tests. Oh and there be some blue clips in their also, put those on your head."  
"总之，简单来说，插入栓服能让你与 EVA 同步。不过，既然你能通过其他方法与 EVA 同步，或许你就不必使用它了。这一切都还在测试阶段。哦，还有，里面会有一些蓝色夹子，把它们戴在头上。"

Shinji tried to keep all this in his head, as he followed Misato's instructions.  
真嗣努力记住这一切，同时按照美里小姐的指示行动。

After several annoying minutes of getting used to the fabric which was unbearably tight after pressing a button he found that Misato had failed to mention Shinji walked out of the boys locker room, clipping the nerve receptors onto his head.  
经过几分钟令人烦躁的适应，那布料紧得让人难以忍受，他按下了一个按钮，发现美里忘记告诉他的事情——真嗣走出了男更衣室，将神经感受器夹在头上。

Shinji had admit-tingly thought that Asuka was cute when he had first seen her, and had realized that she was even more attractive now that he got to know her, this however blew him away. He hadn't even thought about the fact that she would be wearing a plug suit also and it hit him like a piano when he saw her in the bright red plug suit. It complemented her curves precisely and there was no lack of anything. He considered himself not overly perverted but this pushed the limits.  
真嗣不得不承认，第一次见到明日香时，他就觉得她很可爱，而现在了解她之后，他发现她更加迷人了，但这完全让他震惊。他甚至没想过她也会穿插入栓服，当看到她穿着鲜红色的插入栓服时，这感觉就像一架钢琴砸中了他。那紧身衣完美地衬托出她的曲线，没有任何不足之处。他自认不算过于好色，但这确实超出了他的极限。

Asuka must have caught him gaping openly because she tossed her hair behind her head and seemed to give a seducing smile towards him. This pulled Shinji out of his stupor and he had to curse himself slightly for his stupidity. It was obvious that she had been expecting this kind of reaction from him and was throughly enjoying it.  
明日香肯定注意到了他目瞪口呆的样子，因为她把头发甩到脑后，似乎对他露出了一个诱人的微笑。这让真嗣从恍惚中回过神来，他不得不暗自咒骂自己的愚蠢。显然，她早就预料到他会这样反应，并且乐在其中。

Determinedly wrenching his eyes away from her they instead settled on Rei. Her plug suit was more or less the same as his except more white while his was largely blue.  
他坚决地移开视线，不再看她，转而注视着丽。她的插入栓服和他的大致相同，只是白色部分更多，而他的则主要是蓝色。

Misato appeared to witness this whole ordeal and let it continue until things seemed to pass.  
美里似乎目睹了整个过程，任其继续，直到一切似乎都过去了。

"Now then you know what to do...Shinji just follow the girls and ask if you have any questions."  
“那么，你知道该怎么做...真嗣，跟着女孩们走，有任何问题就问。”

'Not like I'll get them answered if I ask,' he thought bitterly as he stared at Asuka's back.  
“问了也不会得到回答的。”他苦涩地想着，目光凝视着明日香的背影。

---

'So far so good,' Shinji thought as he finished strapping himself in to Eva Unit 01. Looking at the monitor he saw that Asuka and Rei had done likewise. Suddenly Misato's voice came over on the loud speaker.  
“目前为止一切顺利。”真嗣想着，完成了对 EVA 初号机的固定。他看向屏幕，发现明日香和绫波也已经准备就绪。突然，美里通过扩音器传来了声音。

"OK everything is ready on our end. Go ahead and start concentrating you guys. I want to get this done as quickly as possible."  
“好了，我们这边已经准备妥当。你们开始集中精神吧。我希望尽快完成这件事。”

Shinji assumed that she was worried about him and rather thankful at that. Gathering everything that he could remember during his past fights in the Eva he closed his eyes and solely concentrated on something he never thought he would, syncing with the voice that had plagued his dreams.  
真嗣猜测她是在担心他，并且对此颇为感激。他集中精力，回忆起过去在 EVA 战斗中的点点滴滴，闭上眼睛，全神贯注于一个他从未想过会去关注的事物——与那个困扰他梦境的声音同步。

Almost immediately he heard a small whisper and soon it developed into a strong voice.  
几乎立刻，他听到了一个微弱的低语，很快这声音变得强烈起来。

"_Glad your finally getting the time to get to know me better."_  
“很高兴你终于有时间更好地了解我了。”

Shinji was quiet as he didn't want anything to interfere with his thought process.  
真嗣保持沉默，不想让任何事情干扰他的思考过程。

"_Thats rather rude, ignoring me like that. What, did your parents never teach you any manners?"_  
“那样无视我真是太没礼貌了。怎么，你父母没教过你礼貌吗？”

Something sparked in Shinji's mind, but he was quickly able to pass it off. However it was noticed in the command room.  
真嗣脑海中闪过一丝念头，但他很快就能将其抛诸脑后。然而，这一细微变化在指挥室中被察觉到了。

"Anomaly detected in Unit 01."  
"发现 01 号单元异常。"

Misato immediately spun in the direction of the voice and barked. "What is it?"  
美里立刻转向声音的方向，厉声问道：“怎么回事？”

"Wait...nothing, it disappeared."  
"等等……没事了，它消失了。"

Misato frowned worriedly and said, "Keep an eye on Unit 01 and let me know if anything changes."  
美里皱着眉头担忧地说：“盯紧零号机，有任何变化立刻通知我。”

"Yes ma'am!" “是的，女士！”

Back in Unit 01 Shinji was starting to sweat from concentrating, that and the voice was really starting to get on his nerves.  
回到零号机内，真嗣因为集中精神而开始出汗，再加上那个声音真的开始让他烦躁起来。

"_So ready for the next angel attack? I know I am. Just let me know and I'll rip it to shreds. What I wouldn't give for a good blood bath right now."_  
“准备好迎接下一个使徒了吗？我知道我准备好了。告诉我，我会把它撕成碎片。我现在多么渴望好好洗个血浴啊。”

"Shut...it," whispered Shinji.  
"闭...嘴，" 真嗣低声说道。

"_Here I am trying to strike up a conversation with you and thats all you can say, phish, ass."_  
"我在这里努力想和你聊聊天，你就只能说这些，真是的，笨蛋。"

Shinji then started to talk to the voice deep in his subconscious. "Okay fine, we'll talk."  
真嗣随后开始与深藏在他潜意识中的那个声音对话。"好吧，好吧，我们聊聊。"

"_Good, because its boring if you don't."_  
"很好，因为如果你不这样做，那就太无聊了。"

"What or who are you?"  
"你是什么，或者你是谁？"

"_The thing that lives inside of the Eva."_  
"住在 Eva 里面的那个东西。"

Shinji was startled by this new streak of information and it showed with his sync ratio.  
这条新信息让真嗣吓了一跳，这从他的同步率中显露无遗。

Gaining control of his thoughts he said, "What do you mean the thing that lives inside the Eva?"  
他控制住自己的思绪，说道：“你说的‘住在 Eva 里的东西’是什么意思？”

"_Those humans don't tell you much do they."_  
“那些人类没告诉你多少，是吧。”

Shinji didn't want to admit it but the voice was right. "I never asked, but what are you."  
真嗣不想承认，但那个声音是对的。“我从没问过，但你是什么？”

"_An entity, thats good enough for now."_  
“一个存在，目前这样就足够了。”

"Fine, why me?" “好吧，为什么是我？”

"_You intrigue me, simple enough. You're different then all the other humans that have ever piloted me. At first I thought about killing you but after looking inside of your soul I learned a few things about you that made me curious."_  
"你引起了我的兴趣，就这么简单。你和其他所有曾经驾驶过我的人类都不同。起初我想过要杀掉你，但在窥视你的灵魂之后，我发现了关于你的几件事，让我感到好奇。"

"And those things are?" "那些事是什么？"

"_Stuff that you wouldn't want to know. Put it this way, your better of not knowing."_  
"你不会想知道的那些事。这么说吧，不知道对你更好。"

"And if I still want to know?"  
"如果我仍然想知道呢？"

"_Most likely you'll go insane from it and thats not happening anytime soon. I need you sane, so don't even ask."_  
"最有可能的是，你会因此发疯，而且这不会很快发生。我需要你保持理智，所以别再问了。"

"Fine then do you have anything to do with the visions that I am having. Ever since I pilot you the first time I've been having visions of people that I know or events that may or not happen. I damn sick of them."  
"好吧，那你和我的那些幻觉有关系吗？自从我第一次驾驶你以来，我就一直在看到我认识的人或可能发生的事件。我他妈的受够了这些。"

"_I can't control things that happen outside of this small space, so I have no idea what your babbling about."_  
"我无法掌控这个小空间之外的事情，所以你说的那些我一无所知。"

"Fine, thanks for nothing."  
"好吧，谢了，啥也没帮上。"

"_Anytime."_ "随时乐意。"

Shinji lapsed into silence as he felt his conscious slide back to where he currently was. Opening one of his eyes he glanced at a screen to his right and saw Asuka with her eyes closed doing the same thing that he was doing. Unable to hold back the smirk after getting another look at her red plug suit he turned away quickly so as to not interrupt his concentration.  
真嗣陷入了沉默，他的意识逐渐回到了当前所在之处。他睁开一只眼睛，瞥向右侧的屏幕，看到明日香闭着眼睛，做着和他一样的事情。再次看到她那红色插入栓服后，他忍不住露出了微笑，但很快又转过头去，以免打断自己的专注。

Then, the pain hit him. Shinji felt like his mind was going to split down the middle as reality was torn from him. Flashes passed him as he saw a dark room with the walls lit up in red, a sea the color of blood, his mother who he could barely remember smiling back at him before she turned into a creature with no face. Nothing was real and everyone was gone. It was just Shinji inside the entry plug of Eva Unit 01 screaming like he was wounded.  
随后，疼痛袭来。真嗣感觉自己的意识仿佛要被撕裂，现实从他身边被剥离。闪回的画面掠过眼前：一个黑暗的房间，墙壁被红色照亮，一片血色的海洋，他几乎记不清的母亲微笑着回头看他，随即变成了一只没有面孔的生物。一切都不真实，所有人都消失了。只剩下真嗣在 EVA 初号机的插入栓内，像受伤一样尖叫。

Misato reacted quickly at the first sound of Shinji's screams. "Disengage the umbilical cords for all three Eva's, and get Rei and Asuka out of there as quickly as possible. Status of Eva Unit 01?"  
听到真嗣的尖叫声，美里迅速做出反应。“立即断开三台 EVA 的脐带电缆，尽快将绫波和明日香带出来。初号机的状态如何？”

"Pilot live signs are fluctuating abnormally. The LCL fluid inside the entry plug is heating up, passing normal temperatures...critical reached."  
"驾驶员生命迹象异常波动。插入栓内的 LCL 液体温度升高，超过正常值...已达到临界点。"

"Entry plug removal for Unit 00 and Unit 02 have been confirmed, pilots safe."  
"零号机与二号机的插入栓已确认移除，驾驶员安全。"

"Get them the hell out of there! Try removing the entry plug for Unit 01."  
"立刻把他们带出来！尝试移除初号机的插入栓。"

"Negative it will not recognize the signature."  
"负面的，它无法识别签名。"

Misato bit her nail in fear. When someone alerted her of something important.  
美里紧张地咬着指甲。当有人向她报告重要事情时。

"Commander Misato you might want to look at this."  
"美里指挥官，您可能需要看看这个。"

"What," she snapped. "什么，"她厉声道。

"Its Unit 01's sync rate."  
"这是 01 号机的同步率。"

Misato was over there in a flash and froze when she saw the synchronization between the pilot and the Eva. It was fluctuating from plus one hundred to negative one hundred something that had never been seen before.  
Misato 瞬间冲了过去，当她看到驾驶员与 Eva 之间的同步率时，整个人都僵住了。同步率从正一百波动到负一百多，这种从未见过的现象让她震惊不已。

In a shaky voice Misato managed to get the words out, "Record this...for future reference."  
美里用颤抖的声音勉强说出：“记录下来……以备将来参考。”

"Yes ma'am." “是，长官。”

Getting a hold of her feelings for Shinji who's screams had subsided she looked back at the screen where his life signs were unknown.  
她努力控制住对真嗣的情感，他的尖叫声已经平息，她回头看向屏幕，那里显示着他的生命迹象未知。

"Does Unit 01 appear to be going berserk."  
"初号机似乎要暴走了。"

"It does not appear to be so."  
"看起来并非如此。"

Misato bit her nail again and said, "Get a team down there to restrain the Eva, and if you see any signs of movement get the hell back here. I don't want anyones life in danger."  
美里再次咬了咬指甲，说道：“派一支队伍下去制服 Eva，一旦发现任何动静，立刻撤回来。我不想任何人冒生命危险。”

At this moment Asuka came bursting into the command room with Rei behind her with a somewhat passive look.  
就在这时，明日香猛地冲进了指挥室，身后跟着表情略显被动的绫波。

"What the hell is going on, why did you call of the tests!"  
“到底怎么回事，为什么取消了测试！”

Misato did not want to deal with this right now and ignored Asuka who was not happy about it.  
美里现在不想处理这些，她无视了不满的明日香。

"Misato what is going on!"  
"美里，这是怎么回事！"

"Shinji's life is currently in danger and we are trying to recover him, that is the current situation!"  
"真嗣的生命现在处于危险之中，我们正在设法救他，这就是目前的状况！"

Asuka was slightly taken back as Misato had never snapped at her like that before. Her mood changed from one to anger to one of slight worry. "Is he okay?"  
明日香有些惊讶，因为美里以前从未这样对她发过脾气。她的情绪从愤怒转变为一丝担忧。"他没事吧？"

"I don't know but the last reading we got the temperature in Unit 01 was well over one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit. Since then its most likely climbed. Then...then there's his syncro rate. At times it was in the negatives which is supposed to be impossible and then it would jump up to a hundred which is equally impossible. Its like the Eva wants to kill him but is having second thoughts."  
"我不知道，但上次我们测得 01 号机内的温度已经超过了一百二十华氏度。从那以后很可能还在上升。然后...然后是他的同步率。有时会降到负值，这本应是不可能的，然后又会突然飙升到百分百，同样是不可能的。就好像 Eva 想要杀了他，却又犹豫不决。"

All Asuka could mange was a slight, "Oh." Finding a nearby chair she let herself sink into it and look up at the monitor which was fuzzy.  
明日香只能勉强发出一声轻微的“哦”。她找到附近的一把椅子，让自己沉入其中，抬头看着那模糊的显示屏。

Turning back towards the problem Misato said on the loud speaker, "How does it look down there?"  
米莎托转回面对问题，通过扩音器说道：“下面情况怎么样？”

"Nothing's wrong, Unit 01 is showing no signs of moving, proceeding with containment and the rescuing of the pilot."  
“一切正常，初号机没有任何动静，继续进行收容并营救驾驶员。”

Misato let out a strangled sigh and sank into a seat near her. Soon it would be all over and they'd be able to brush it off as a minor incident. But she knew it wasn't the case this time. If the Eva continued to do this to Shinji then she wouldn't be able to sit by and watch it.  
美里发出一声窒息般的叹息，瘫坐在她旁边的座位上。很快这一切就会结束，他们可以将其视为一个小插曲抛诸脑后。但她知道这次情况不同。如果 Eva 继续这样对待真嗣，她无法袖手旁观。

After several tense minutes of praying that nothing would go wrong the team on the floor managed to manually extract the entry plug from the Eva. LCL fluid poured from the open entry plug and Misato stood up and almost rushed down to the floor.  
在紧张地祈祷了几分钟后，地面上的团队终于手动从 Eva 中取出了插入栓。LCL 液体从打开的插入栓中涌出，美里站起身来，几乎要冲下楼去。

"We've got him, he's unconscious but miraculously alive."  
"我们抓到他了，他昏迷不醒但奇迹般地还活着。"

Misato let out a strangled sigh and suddenly felt like having several beers. It had been to close.  
美里发出一声哽咽的叹息，突然很想喝几杯啤酒。刚才真是太险了。

"There's something though, while the LCL was close to two hundred degrees in there his body is oddly cold. The only thing the LCL fluid seemed to destroy was his plug suit."  
"不过有件事很奇怪，尽管 LCL 温度接近两百度，他的身体却异常冰冷。LCL 液体似乎只破坏了他的插入栓服。"

"So what he's naked?" "他光着身子又怎么了？"

"...Well, yeah." "...嗯，是啊。"

Misato could have almost laughed. "Take him to the emergency room. I'll have doctor Akagi be ready for you when you get there."  
美里几乎要笑出声来。“带他去急诊室。我会让赤城医生准备好，等你们到了那里。”

Slouching deeper in her chair she spun around in her chair to see Asuka sitting there with her legs drawn up to her chest.  
她懒洋洋地陷进椅子里，转过身来看到明日香坐在那里，双腿蜷缩到胸前。

"Well he's okay," smiled Misato.  
“他没事，”美里微笑着说。

Asuka nodded in a forlorn sort of way. Misato had an idea though that might perk her up a little.  
明日香有些沮丧地点了点头。不过美里有个主意，或许能让她振作一点。

"Though I have no idea why, but he was for some reason naked in the entry plug when they found him. The LCL fluid burned off just the plug suit but his body was quite cold."  
虽然不知道为什么，但他们在插入栓里发现他时，他不知为何一丝不挂。LCL 液体只烧掉了插入栓服，但他的身体却异常冰冷。

Asuka's face turned a small shade of pink before she stood up and said, "Why the hell are you telling me something as disgusting as that. As if I'd want to know...how he was."  
明日香的脸微微泛红，然后站起来说：“你干嘛告诉我这么恶心的事。好像我想知道他怎么样似的……”

Misato let out the first smile since since the whole ordeal and stood up. "Well, lets at least be sure that he is completely okay before we start celebrating."  
美里在这场风波后第一次露出微笑，站起身来。“好吧，至少在我们开始庆祝之前，先确保他完全没事。”

Asuka snorted but followed her all the same.  
明日香哼了一声，但还是跟了上去。

---

"This is...familiar." “这地方……似曾相识。”

Shinji sat up in his hospital bed and felt his temples sear with pain. Whatever had happened it he couldn't remember anything. He remembered he had just taken a peek at Asuka before he blacked out. Now he was in a hospital room, naked, with a few chairs around his bed and his sheets bearing signs that someone had been sitting on them.  
真嗣在医院的病床上坐起身，感到太阳穴一阵剧痛。无论发生了什么，他都记不起来了。他只记得自己刚刚瞥了一眼明日香，然后就失去了意识。现在他躺在医院的病房里，一丝不挂，床边散落着几把椅子，床单上还留有被人坐过的痕迹。

"Looks like you finally woke up Shinji."  
"看来你终于醒了，真嗣。"

Shinji shifted so that he was facing the door and saw Ritsuko leaning against the wall with a cigarette in her hand.  
真嗣挪动身体，让自己面对着门，看到律子靠在墙上，手里夹着一支烟。

Shinji's first intentions where to ask what happened but Ritsuko beat him to it.  
真嗣本想问发生了什么，但律子抢先了一步。

"Don't worry about what happened, your safe and everybody's fine. You've been through a lot and are lucky to be alive. I'm keeping you here for two days at least to be sure. But I suppose I shouldn't badger you anymore, someone's been bothering me every few minutes to see if your awak-"  
"别担心发生了什么，你很安全，大家都没事。你经历了很多，能活下来真是幸运。我至少要留你在这里两天确保一切无恙。不过我想我不该再打扰你了，每隔几分钟就有人来问我你是否醒了……"

With that Ritsuko was pushed to the side as Misato darted into the room with a rather reluctant looking Asuka and a passive Rei in tow.  
说完这话，律子被推到一旁，美里冲进房间，身后跟着一脸不情愿的明日香和表情平静的丽。

"Shinji! Oh thank God you're okay. I knew it was a bad idea to have you do the tests."  
"真嗣！哦，感谢上帝你没事。我就知道让你去做那些测试是个坏主意。"

"Misato calm down, I'm fine."  
"美里，冷静点，我没事。"

"But you almost weren't, everyone was worried."  
"但你差点就出事了，大家都担心得要命。"

Shinji raised an eyebrow and looked over at Asuka who glared at him as though daring him to ask if she had been worried.  
真嗣挑了挑眉，看向明日香，她瞪着他，仿佛在挑衅他敢不敢问她是否也担心了。

"Glad that everyone was worried."  
"很高兴大家都这么担心。"

"Yes, well, I'm going to go ahead and have the commander pull you off of Unit 01. Its apparent that no one is able to handle it."  
"是的，好吧，我打算让指挥官把你从 01 号单位撤下来。显然没人能驾驭它。"

"No, I'm going to continue piloting it."  
"不，我要继续驾驶它。"

A long silence filled the room at Shinji's words. Misato was dumbfounded, even Asuka seemed to be surprised. Only Rei showed signs of knowing about his decision all along.  
在真嗣的话语落下后，房间里弥漫着长久的沉默。美里目瞪口呆，就连明日香也似乎感到惊讶。只有丽表现出早已知晓他决定的样子。

"But Shinji after what almost happened to you...I can't possibly put you inside that thing. What if something similar happens while in a battle."  
“但是，真嗣，经历了几乎丧命的危险后……我怎么可能再让你进入那东西里。万一战斗中发生类似的事情怎么办？”

Shaking his head Shinji said, "And what happens if you need help. I'm the only person who's ever been able to pilot it, besides I'm supposed to be dead now so for the fact that I survived I should be the pilot."  
真嗣摇摇头说：“如果你们需要帮助怎么办？我是唯一能驾驶它的人，而且我本该已经死了，既然我活了下来，我就应该成为驾驶员。”

Misato opened her mouth to argue again but Shinji cut her off. "I'm sorry Misato but I don't want it any other way. I want to help all I can and if piloting an Eva is what I can do I'll do it.  
美里张嘴还想争辩，但真嗣打断了她。“对不起，美里，但我不想有别的选择。我想尽我所能帮助大家，如果驾驶 Eva 是我能做到的，那我就去做。”

"Enough with the sympathy already," said an irritated Asuka. "He's healed and stubborn once again, can we leave now?"  
“别再同情了，”明日香不耐烦地说，“他已经痊愈又固执起来了，我们现在可以走了吗？”

"Don't act like you weren't worried Asuka," smirked Misato.  
“别装得你没担心过似的，明日香，”美里得意地笑道。

Asuka blinked, "Not a chance. Why would I worry about him?"  
明日香眨了眨眼，“没门儿。我干嘛要担心他？”

Shinji frowned at Asuka but ignored it. She'd always be the same, well he'd open up if she ever did.  
真嗣对明日香皱了皱眉，但没理会。她总是这样，如果她愿意敞开心扉，他也会的。

Misato sighed and said, "Fine we'll head home for now, but be back later with some fresh cooking. Hospital food can get sickening quickly."  
美里叹了口气说：“好吧，我们先回家，但晚点会带着新鲜烹饪的食物回来。医院的食物很快就会让人反胃。”

Asuka suddenly realized that she'd have to survive two days without Shinji to cook for her. Glaring at him in an annoyed sort of way as though it was his fault he was injured she mouthed, "Get well soon, or I'll be dead of food poisoning before you get back."  
明日香突然意识到，她得在没有真嗣做饭的情况下熬过两天。她恼怒地瞪着他，仿佛是他受伤的错，然后无声地说：“快点好起来，不然你回来之前我就要死于食物中毒了。”

Shinji smiled and mouthed, "Will do," back.  
真嗣微笑着，无声地回应：“会的。”

Asuka's face seemed to twitch slightly as she appeared to be working up the power for a smile. Though halfway through it turned into more of a grimace at which point she turned around quickly and stormed out of the room.  
明日香的脸似乎微微抽搐了一下，她似乎在努力挤出一个微笑。但笑到一半变成了苦笑，于是她迅速转身，气冲冲地走出了房间。

Misato and Shinji frowned at her but both started laughing silently. Regaining control of herself Misato said, "Don't pay to much attention to what Asuka says Shinji, she was worried, just didn't want to show it."  
美里和真嗣对她皱了皱眉，但两人都默默地笑了起来。美里恢复了镇定，说道：“别太在意明日香说的话，真嗣，她只是担心，只是不想表现出来。”

"I've long since realized that."  
“我早就意识到了。”

"Well, you seem fine so no point in taking anymore time. I'm sure Ritsuko will want to run some more tests on you so I won't get in her way anymore."  
“嗯，你看起来没事了，再花时间也没意义。我相信律子会想再给你做些检查，我就不再妨碍她了。”

"Thanks, Misato." "谢谢你，美里。"

"Don't worry about it. I am your guardian after all."  
"别担心。我毕竟是你的守护者。"

That ment a lot to Shinji but he wasn't about to say that. He still had trouble expressing his feelings sometimes.  
这对真嗣意义重大，但他并不打算说出口。他有时仍难以表达自己的情感。

"I'll see you later today then, with dinner."  
"那我们今天晚些时候见，一起吃晚饭。"

Shinji tried to not look sick, "Okay I'll be waiting."  
真嗣努力不让自己看起来想吐，“好的，我会等着。”

When Misato left the room Shinji was about to roll onto his side and fall back asleep when he realized that not everyone had left the room.  
当美里离开房间后，真嗣正要翻身继续睡，却意识到并非所有人都离开了房间。

"Why did you decide to continue piloting it," asked Rei?  
“你为什么决定继续驾驶它？”绫波问道。

Shinji sat up slowly and looked at her curiously. Since he had met Ayanami Rei he had only ever seen her talk to himself. Shrugging Shinji said, "I don't know. I feel like I'll regret it if I don't do something I guess."  
真嗣缓缓坐起身，好奇地看着她。自从遇见绫波零以来，他只见过她对自己说话。真嗣耸耸肩说：“我不知道。我觉得如果我不做点什么，我会后悔的。”

"So you're doing because you want to, not because other people have told you to."  
“所以你这么做是因为你想做，而不是因为别人叫你做。”

Shinji replied slowly, "Yes other people have asked me to but its still my decision to pilot it."  
真嗣缓缓回答：“是的，虽然别人请求过我，但驾驶它仍然是我的决定。”

"Are you sure about that?"  
"你确定吗？"

"I'm me. How can I not be sure about the things that I decide?"  
"我就是我。我怎么可能不确定自己决定的事情呢？"

Rei then lapsed into silence as though not sure how to continue.  
丽随后陷入了沉默，仿佛不确定如何继续。

"If your done with questioning me I'd be thankful if you left so I can get some sleep."  
"如果你问完了，我感激你离开，让我能睡一会儿。"

Rei looked at him curiously for a second and then quietly excused herself from his room.  
丽好奇地看了他一眼，然后悄悄地离开了他的房间。

Shinji then rolled over onto his side and closed his eyes. However whenever he would he saw the horrible things that were shown to him in the entry plug. He ended up not sleeping that night.  
真嗣随后侧身躺下，闭上了眼睛。然而，每当他试图入睡时，驾驶舱里看到的可怕景象就会浮现在他眼前。那一晚，他彻夜未眠。

### Chapter 6: Past and Present  
第六章：过去与现在  

Shinji was released from the hospital earlier then expected as he had recovered surprisingly quickly and he didn't show any signs of mental contamination. So Misato quickly ran home and dropped him off before rushing back to Nerv saying that she'd be working late again and to worry about making enough food for her.  
真嗣比预期更早出院，因为他恢复得惊人地快，并且没有表现出任何精神污染的迹象。于是，美里急忙跑回家把他放下，然后又匆匆赶回 NERV，说她又要工作到很晚，并叮嘱他为她准备足够的食物。

Shinji was rather hesitant as he stood outside of Misato's apartment. He hadn't talked to Asuka since he had been admitted to the hospital and was worried if she'd blow up in his face. Though he was saved the need to as the door came flying open and almost hit him in the face.  
真嗣站在美里小姐的公寓外，显得颇为犹豫。自从他住院以来，还没和明日香说过话，担心她会突然发火。然而，他还没来得及敲门，门就猛地被撞开，差点撞到他的脸。

"About time your back, I though I was going to die."  
“你总算回来了，我还以为我要死了呢。”

Shinji looked up and turned his head quickly as he got a glimpse of Asuka who was in nothing but a red towel. Shinji tried desperately not to think about her in her plug suit then. Asuka however noticed him turn away quickly and looked down at herself apparently just realizing what she was wearing.  
真嗣抬头迅速瞥了一眼，只见明日香只裹着一条红色毛巾。他拼命不去想她穿着插入栓服的样子。然而，明日香注意到他迅速转过头去，低头看了看自己，显然是刚刚意识到自己穿了什么。

"Ah never seen a girl this close to being naked? Turns you on a little doesn't it?"  
"啊，没见过女孩穿得这么少吗？是不是有点让你心动了？"

Shinji didn't want to admit that what she said was true so he just pushed past her. "Just get dressed already, I don't know what you're thinking opening the door while wearing nothing but a towel."  
真嗣不想承认她的话是真的，所以他只是推开她。“快点穿好衣服，我不知道你在想什么，只裹着一条毛巾就开门。”

"If it wasn't you or Misato I would have simply kicked them in the balls, course I might do the same to you anyway."  
“如果不是你或美里，我早就一脚踢过去了，当然，对你我可能也会这么做。”

Shinji whipped around and faced her. Asuka was rather startled but stood her ground. "What!"  
真嗣猛地转过身面对她。明日香颇为吃惊，但还是站稳了脚跟。“什么！”

Shinji glared at her for a moment but sighed and said, "Sorry, I'm just a little agitated is all."  
真嗣瞪了她一会儿，然后叹了口气说：“对不起，我只是有点烦躁而已。”

"I suppose I'd be annoyed too if I had to stay two days stuck in that damn hospital room. Anyway I'm sick of take out food and microwaved meals, I want some real food."  
“我想如果我得在那个该死的医院房间里呆上两天，我也会很烦的。不管怎样，我吃腻了外卖和微波炉食品，我想吃点真正的食物。”

"Hai, I'll get started." "嗨，我这就开始。"

"Good, and don't-" "好，还有别——"

"No way in hell would I peek, just move it!"  
"地狱里都没门我会偷看，快挪开！"

Asuka was startled by his outburst and slightly rebuked herself for egging him on. Shrugging she let it drop and walked into her room.  
明日香被他的爆发吓了一跳，暗自责备自己不该激他。她耸耸肩，不再追究，走进了自己的房间。

"Well, I suppose its adequate to say the least," said Asuka as soon as she finished Shinji's cooking which consisted of her favorite: Sauerkraut.  
“好吧，至少可以说还算过得去。”明日香一吃完真嗣做的饭就说道，那里面有她最喜欢的酸菜。

Shinji almost snorted. He knew that it was more then adequate and that she had almost been starving herself for two days.  
真嗣差点笑出声来。他知道那不仅仅是过得去，她几乎已经饿了两天。

"When is Misato supposed to be home anyway," asked Asuka?  
"Misato 到底什么时候该回家来着？" 明日香问道。

"No idea. Late tonight I think."  
"不知道。我想应该是今晚很晚吧。"

"Great, well no way am I going to stay here with you."  
"太好了，那我可不打算和你一起待在这儿。"

"Fine, leave for all I care."  
“好啊，你走吧，我才不在乎。”

Asuka hadn't really been serious when she had said that she was leaving, she just wanted to see what Shinji's reaction would have been. Though from his reaction she guessed that he really didn't care and was slightly hurt by that.  
明日香当时说离开并不是认真的，她只是想看看真嗣会有什么反应。但从他的反应来看，她猜他真的不在乎，这让她有点受伤。

"Fine! If you don't care then I will leave!"  
“好！既然你不在乎，那我就走！”

Standing up abruptly she let her plate fall to the floor and storm off to her room where she tossed on a red sweatshirt with a hood.  
她猛地站起来，任由盘子掉落在地，气冲冲地跑回房间，套上一件带帽子的红色运动衫。

Shinji had half a mind to stop her and was just about to say he was sorry when she stormed out of her room before pausing and throwing a dirty scowl in his direction. As she turned around Shinji lunged forward and grabbed her wrist and waited for her reaction as she turned slowly around.  
真嗣本想拦住她，正要开口道歉，她却已经冲出房间，临走前还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。当她转身时，真嗣向前一扑，抓住了她的手腕，等待着她的反应，她缓缓转过身来。

"Let go damn it!" “放开我，该死的！”

Shinji hesitated but let his grip slack, and she was able to wrench her wrist free of his hand. Rubbing her wrist in a confused sort of way she looked back at Shinji who had his eyes angled towards the ground.  
真嗣犹豫了一下，但松开了手，她得以挣脱他的掌握。她困惑地揉着手腕，回头看向真嗣，他正目光低垂，盯着地面。

'What was that,' she thought? 'He actually seemed strong.'  
'刚才那是怎么回事？'她心想，'他看起来真的很有力量。'

Ignoring her thought she said. "What, do you want to say something?"  
她没理会自己的想法，问道："怎么，你想说什么吗？"

Shinji opened his mouth and closed it, unsure of how he should proceed.  
真嗣张开了嘴又合上，不确定该如何继续。

"If your not going to say anything then I'm leaving!"  
“如果你什么都不打算说，那我就走了！”

"Wait...Asuka." “等等……明日香。”

Asuka had her hand on the door nob as he said this and paused trying to decide whether she should listen or ignore him. She didn't really want to leave if she was honest with herself. Turning around slowly she said, "I'm listening."  
明日香手握在门把手上，听到这话时停了下来，试图决定是该听还是无视他。老实说，她并不真的想离开。她缓缓转过身，说道：“我在听。”

Shinji fidgeted slightly before looking up at her hesitantly. "I'm sorry for snapping at you..."  
真嗣稍微扭动了一下，然后犹豫地抬头看向她。“我为刚才对你发火道歉……”

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"I'm sorry okay! I didn't mean what I said about not caring. Truth is I do."  
“对不起，好吗！我刚才说的不是真心话，关于不在乎的那部分。事实上，我确实在乎。”

Asuka frowned at him for a second before walking past him. Shinji winced slightly as he thought that he was going to get hit as she walked by but opened his eyes when he realized that she had already walked past. Sighing in a reassuring way he almost jumped several feet in the air as he heard her whisper behind him, "Good, because I didn't want to in the first place."  
明日香皱着眉头看了他一秒，然后从他身边走过。真嗣在她经过时微微缩了一下，以为会被打，但睁开眼时发现她已经走过去了。他松了一口气，几乎跳了起来，因为她在他身后低声说：“好，因为我一开始就不想这么做。”

Shinji let out a reluctant smile that he hoped that she wouldn't see. Giving her a few seconds he just had time to see her walking into the living room throwing off the sweatshirt as she walked giving him a brief view of her bareback. Tossing these thoughts to the side he started walking towards the kitchen to clean up when he saw her poke her head into the hallway.  
真嗣露出了一个不情愿的微笑，希望她没看到。他给了她几秒钟时间，正好看到她走进客厅，边走边脱掉运动衫，让他瞥见了她的裸背。他把这些念头抛到一边，开始走向厨房准备清理，这时看到她探头进了走廊。

"Are you coming or what?"  
“你来不来？”

Shinji's face showed total confusion as he looked back at her. Asuka sighed in an annoyed sort of way and jerked her finger towards the living room.  
真嗣的脸上满是困惑，他回头看着她。明日香带着一种恼怒的语气叹了口气，用手指向客厅。

"I'm telling you to get over here. I don't care whether you watch what I'm watching or read a book, but I'm giving you the day off so forget about the dishes. Misato can clean then for once."  
“我叫你过来。我不在乎你是看我看的节目还是看书，但今天我给你放假，别管洗碗了。让美里自己打扫一次吧。”

Did Shinji hear that right? Did Asuka want to spend time with him actually?  
真嗣听对了吗？明日香真的想和他一起度过时间吗？

"Uh sure..." “呃，当然...”

As Shinji walked hesitantly into the living room he had to refrain from quickly peeking in. Most of the time when Shinji or Asuka were alone by themselves at home Asuka forbade Shinji from stepping into the living room. So he usually spent most of his time in his bedroom listening to his SDAT.  
当真嗣犹豫地走进客厅时，他不得不克制自己迅速偷看的冲动。大多数时候，当真嗣或明日香独自在家时，明日香禁止真嗣进入客厅。所以他通常大部分时间都待在自己的卧室里听他的 SDAT。

Asuka was sprawled on her back on the couch with her head tilted up looking at the T.V. She must have heard Shinji cause she sat up briefly and pointed to a spot on the floor. Shinji nodded and ran into his room to grab a book. While she was watching something that wasn't German it was still a Japanese soap opera.  
明日香仰面躺在沙发上，头向后仰看着电视。她一定是听到了真嗣的声音，因为她短暂地坐了起来，指着地板上的一个位置。真嗣点点头，跑回房间拿了一本书。尽管她看的不是德语节目，但仍然是一部日本肥皂剧。

Even though they were in the same room together, any forms of conversation was dropped dead when they were started. Neither were really sure what to say to the other as they were usually glaring at each other. Several times Shinji tried to ask her something but she either waved him off because it was an important part in her T.V. show or she frowned at him and ignored his question. Shinji was starting to wonder why he had even agreed to be in the living room with her.  
尽管他们同处一室，任何形式的对话一旦开始便戛然而止。两人都不确定该对对方说些什么，因为他们通常只是互相瞪眼。有好几次，真嗣试图向她提问，但她要么因为电视节目中的重要部分挥手让他走开，要么就皱着眉头无视他的问题。真嗣开始怀疑自己为何要同意和她一起待在客厅里。

Shinji was just starting to think of getting up when a question that he would never thought of normally hit his brain.  
真嗣正想着起身离开，一个他平时绝不会想到的问题突然闪过脑海。

"Um Asuka?" “呃，明日香？”

"Hmmm?" She was to fixated on her program to reply.  
"嗯？" 她过于专注于她的程序，以至于没有回应。

"What are your parents like?"  
"你的父母是什么样的人？"

Shinji could tell that it wasn't something she didn't enjoyed talking about as her entire body seemed to seize up. Attempting to fix what he just uttered he said, "I-I'm sorry. If you don't want to talk about it, its fine."  
真嗣可以看出这不是她喜欢谈论的话题，因为她的整个身体似乎都僵住了。试图弥补他刚才说的话，他说道："我……我很抱歉。如果你不想谈这个，没关系。"

Asuka slowly turned her head towards him and frowned at him. It wasn't one of her usually frowns which showed annoyance, it was more curious.  
明日香缓缓转头看向他，皱起了眉头。这不是她通常那种表示不悦的皱眉，而是带着更多的好奇。

"Why do you want to know?" She asked slowly.  
“你为什么想知道？”她缓缓问道。

Shinji hesitated, "I don't know...I've never really known what a family is like. I told you that my father moved me around from place to place, right."  
真嗣犹豫了一下，“我不知道……我从来没真正了解过家庭是什么样的。我告诉过你，我父亲总是把我从一个地方搬到另一个地方，对吧。”

Asuka thought about it for a minute and remembered what Shinji had told her after he pilot Unit 01 for the first time. She nodded.  
明日香想了一会儿，记起真嗣第一次驾驶初号机后告诉她的话。她点了点头。

"I don't have any idea what a family is like because my mother died when I was young. I don't even know what she looked like. I've never been shown pictures of her and my father doesn't seem to care. I was just told that she died in a lab accident. Misato is more of a mother than anyone I've ever known, though I suppose she can double as a father also, with all the beer she drinks."  
“我对家庭一无所知，因为我母亲在我很小的时候就去世了。我甚至不记得她的样子。从未有人给我看过她的照片，而父亲似乎也不在乎。我只被告知她死于实验室事故。美里比起我所认识的任何人更像一个母亲，尽管我想她也能兼任父亲的角色，毕竟她喝那么多啤酒。”

Asuka had to repress a smile at Shinji's words, though he noticed it anyway.  
听到真嗣的话，明日香不得不忍住笑意，尽管他还是注意到了。

"So I guess what I'm saying is I just want to know what a real family is like."  
“所以我猜我想说的是，我只是想知道一个真正的家庭是什么样的。”

There, back to the subject of her family. It was a subject that Asuka hated to discuss and had long since buried painful memories. Turning off the T.V. that she no longer had an urge to watch she looked back at Shinji and said, "I'd rather not talk about it."  
说到她的家庭，这是一个她讨厌讨论的话题，早已埋藏了痛苦的记忆。她关掉了不再想看的电视，回头看着真嗣说：“我不想谈这个。”

Shinji had expected this when he saw that she seemed to seize up, but was curious anyway.  
真嗣看到她似乎僵住了，就预料到了这一点，但仍然感到好奇。

"Thats okay, if you don't want to talk about it I can understand that."  
"没关系，如果你不想谈这件事，我能理解。"

"So you're mother is dead, and you consider Misato to be your mother."  
"所以你妈妈去世了，而你把美里当成妈妈。"

Shrugging Shinji said, "Compared to all the other roommates that I've ever known she is the most caring out of all them. Though that doesn't mean much as almost all of my other roommates were either partying or drunk."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“与其他我认识的室友相比，她是最关心人的一个。不过这也不算什么，因为我之前的室友几乎不是在聚会就是在醉酒。”

"So then what do you consider me as..."  
"那么你把我当成什么呢..."

Shinji was caught of guard for a moment and was unsure what to say. He had said that he considered Asuka a friend, the first that he had ever had. But fights between them seemed to break out continuously and it was hard to get along with somebody who seemed ready to kick you in the balls at any second.  
真嗣一时措手不及，不知该如何回答。他曾说过把明日香视为朋友，这是他人生中的第一位朋友。但两人之间似乎总是争吵不断，与一个随时可能踢你一脚的人相处实在不易。

Shrugging Shinji said, "I honestly don't know anymore."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，说道：“老实说，我现在真的不知道了。”

Asuka frowned, "And what is that supposed to mean?"  
明日香皱眉，“那是什么意思？”

"I told you that I considered you a friend, the first one I ever made."  
“我告诉过你，我把你视为朋友，是我第一个真正交到的朋友。”

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"We fight so much that I don't know if we even are friends anymore."  
“我们争吵不断，我都不知道我们是否还算朋友了。”

Asuka looked at Shinji for a minute, confused at what he ment. "What do you mean?"  
明日香看着真嗣，困惑于他的意思。“你是什么意思？”

"Why are you always picking on me and calling me stupid!" Shinji blurted out. "Why do you always seem to put me down! Have you once cared about how I feel, no! Its all about you, its always been about you."  
“为什么你总是针对我，叫我笨蛋！”真嗣脱口而出。“为什么你总是贬低我！你有没有一次关心过我的感受，没有！一切都是关于你，一直都是关于你。”

Asuka was silent as Shinji let out all of his frustration about her attitude towards him. She didn't know what to say. It was just how she was. She had never worried about other people's feeling because nobody seemed to care about what she felt. Her own-  
真嗣将他对明日香态度的所有不满发泄出来，明日香沉默不语。她不知道该说什么。她就是这样的人。她从未担心过别人的感受，因为似乎没有人关心她的感受。她自己的——

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"What!" He snapped back. "什么！" 他厉声回应道。

"I'd rather not argue with you right now."  
"我现在不想和你争论。"

"Who's arguing!" "谁在争辩！"

"Just shut it...please..."  
"只是闭嘴...请..."

It was the please more than anything that calmed Shinji down. He could never remember hearing her voice as soft as this, or the words please coming out of her mouth.  
正是这个“请”字，比什么都更能安抚真嗣。他从未记得她的声音如此柔和，或是从她口中听到“请”这个字。

Sitting up, he was about to return to his room as he knew that an outburst from the two of them was soon to follow but he was surprised when her words stopped him.  
他坐起身来，正准备回到自己的房间，因为他知道那两人很快就会爆发争吵，但她的言语却让他意外地停下了脚步。

"Wait, Shinji..." “等等，真嗣……”

Shinji looked over his shoulder to see Asuka sitting up with a meek expression on her face. "What," he said, but it was much calmer.  
真嗣回头一看，只见明日香坐起身来，脸上带着温顺的表情。“怎么了？”他问道，语气比平时平静许多。

Asuka leaned back into the couch cushions and bit her lip. "I-I...I'm sorry damn it."  
明日香向后靠在沙发垫上，咬了咬嘴唇。“我……我……该死，对不起。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow. "You...sorry?"  
真嗣挑了挑眉。“你……道歉？”

"Yes, is that so weird?"  
“是的，这很奇怪吗？”

"Actually yes, I've never heard you say you were sorry for anything."  
"实际上是的，我从没听你说过你为任何事感到抱歉。"

"Well, now you have." "好吧，现在你听到了。"

"And?" "然后呢？"

"And what!" “那又怎样！”

"What is that supposed to do? Your sorry, cool. Not like you can reverse everything that you've ever said or did to me."  
“那能有什么用？你道歉了，很好。但不像你能收回你对我说的或做的一切。”

Asuka had never received verbal abuse anywhere near close to what Shinji was dishing and felt like she was close to tears.  
绫波从未遭受过如此接近真嗣所施加的言语伤害，她感到自己快要哭了。

"Damn it Shinji, what do you want me to do!"  
"该死的真嗣，你到底想让我做什么！"

Shrugging he said, "I don't know. I really don't anymore."  
他耸耸肩说：“我不知道。我真的不知道了。”

"Tell me then ass-hole!" “那就告诉我，混蛋！”

"This is exactly what I mean. You give no regard to what other peoples feelings are."  
“这正是我的意思。你丝毫不顾及别人的感受。”

Asuka was slightly abashed but retorted back. "How do you even know what other people's emotion are? You've never had a friend in your life!"  
明日香略感尴尬，随即反驳道：“你怎么可能知道别人的情绪？你这辈子连个朋友都没有！”

Asuka flinched then as Shinji took several quick steps over to her and was fearful that he was about to hit her, or worse. Instead Shinji glared down at her and said, "I may not have many friends but I understand people a lot better than you."  
明日香一惊，只见真嗣快步走向她，她害怕他可能会打她，甚至更糟。然而，真嗣只是瞪着她，说道：“我或许朋友不多，但我比你更懂得人心。”

Shinji realized that he had gone to far then as Asuka looked tearfully back up at him. All the anger seemed to drain out of Shinji as he took a few steps back and sank to the floor. Asuka meanwhile laid back down on the couch and turned her body so that she was facing the couch.  
真嗣意识到自己做得太过分了，因为明日香泪眼汪汪地抬头看着他。所有的怒气似乎都从真嗣身上消失了，他后退了几步，瘫坐在地板上。与此同时，明日香又躺回了沙发上，转身背对着沙发。

After several minutes Shinji broke the silence by saying, "Sorry what I just said, it was rude." She responded by hiccuping slightly.  
几分钟后，真嗣打破了沉默，说道：“对不起，我刚才说的那些话，太粗鲁了。”她回应时微微打了个嗝。

After several painful moments of deciding whether to continue the conversation, Shinji was about to stand up when he saw that Asuka had beat him to it. Whether she had cried silent tears or whether she had already used them all up he wasn't sure, as her face was dry and looking at him. Seconds later Asuka motioned for him to sit next to her. Shinji twitched at this gesture. He wanted to repair what had already transpired, but wasn't sure if it would even matter.  
在经过几个痛苦的瞬间决定是否继续对话后，真嗣正要站起来，却发现明日香已经抢先一步。他不确定她是默默流泪还是已经流干了眼泪，因为她的脸是干的，正看着他。几秒钟后，明日香示意他坐在她旁边。真嗣对这个动作有些紧张。他想要修复已经发生的事情，但不确定这样做是否还有意义。

"Are you sure." Shinji asked hesitantly.  
“你确定吗？” 真嗣犹豫地问道。

Asuka nodded but it was her eyes that Shinji was watching. They showed sincerity and Shinji excepted that.  
明日香点了点头，但真嗣关注的是她的眼睛。它们流露出真诚，真嗣接受了这一点。

Sitting down silently next to Asuka he glanced at her and saw that her eyes were staring at the ground. 'Give her as much time as she needs,' Shinji told himself.  
默默地坐在明日香旁边，他瞥了她一眼，发现她的目光凝视着地面。‘给她足够的时间，’ 真嗣对自己说。

After what seemed an eternity Asuka slowly opened her mouth. "I don't know why I always put you down, I really don't. But-" She paused unsure if she should go on. It was still painful. But he shared and now it was her turn.  
仿佛过了一个世纪，明日香缓缓张开了嘴。“我不知道为什么我总是贬低你，我真的不知道。但是——”她停顿了一下，不确定是否应该继续。那仍然很痛苦。但他分享了，现在轮到她了。

"You could compare our childhoods and see similarities."  
“你可以比较我们的童年，看看相似之处。”

Shinji was startled to no end and gaped confusedly back at her. "What!"  
真嗣惊得目瞪口呆，困惑地回望着她。“什么！”

"I said that from the sound of it we both had troubling childhood!"  
"我说听起来我们俩的童年都不太愉快！"

"You don't have to yell."  
"你不用这么大声。"

"...Sorry." "...抱歉。"

"Its fine." “没事的。”

Asuka nodded and continued. "My mother like yours died early, she worked at Nerv. I remember her though, slightly. I get my hair from her. My father though...he remarried and we were happy for a while. But then...he caught my stepmother sleeping with another man, and she left him for him."  
明日香点点头，继续说道：“我母亲和你母亲一样，很早就去世了，她在 NERV 工作。我虽然对她有些模糊的记忆，但我知道我的头发是遗传自她。至于我父亲……他再婚了，我们曾一度过得很幸福。但后来……他发现继母和另一个男人有染，她就为了那个男人离开了他。”

Shinji was silent but a creese was steadily started to form on his forehead.  
真嗣沉默不语，但他的额头上逐渐皱起了一道纹。

"My father sort of lost it after that...he started drinking heavily. I'd come home some nights and he'd be completely drunk, smelling of booze. Sometimes he'd confuse me for his first wife, my mother, and attack me in a drunken rage. By then I'd starting learning stuff on my own...I think I was six or seven at the time...he rarely remembered my birthdays."  
那之后，我父亲有点崩溃了……他开始酗酒。有些晚上我回家，他会完全醉倒，满身酒气。有时他会把我错当成他的第一任妻子，也就是我的母亲，然后在酒醉中对我发狂。那时我开始自学一些东西……我想我当时六七岁……他很少记得我的生日。

Shinji's frown was now very noticeable and his knuckles were starting to turn white. He also noticed that Asuka's voice was starting to get softer and softer."  
真嗣的眉头现在非常明显，他的指节开始变白。他还注意到明日香的声音开始变得越来越轻。

She continued. "My father slept with so many different women over those three years that I can't count the times that he kept me up at night, with his fucking around." It was the first time that her voice showed a hatred that Shinji had not yet seen. It was something that he had never experienced.  
她继续说道：“那三年里，我父亲和那么多不同的女人睡过，我数不清有多少次他让我彻夜难眠，就因为他那些该死的勾当。”这是她第一次表现出真嗣未曾见过的恨意。这是他从未经历过的情感。

"Several times he'd beat me when he got home, either after a long night of drinking, or after being dumped by another woman. I called 911 several times but each time they showed up he brushed it off as a minor attitude adjustment, saying that I had just had a temper tantrum and that it was all resolved. I don't think I've had a temper tantrum since I was five years old."  
有好几次，他回家后都会打我，要么是酗酒一夜之后，要么是被另一个女人甩了之后。我多次拨打 911，但每次警察来时，他都轻描淡写地说这只是小打小闹，说我只是发了脾气，事情已经解决了。我不记得自己五岁以后还发过脾气。

"I remember I took a test...on my own, my IQ was high enough for it. I had saved up enough money to pay for it. It was to get into a college in Germany. I studied like crazy and starting to distance myself from my so called father. He realized this but ignored it, saying that I'd turn into a slut like all the other woman that he'd ever met."  
我记得我参加了一个测试……靠自己的能力，我的智商足够高。我攒够了钱来支付费用。这是为了进入德国的一所大学。我疯狂学习，开始疏远我所谓的父亲。他意识到了这一点，但置之不理，说我也会变成像他遇到过的所有女人那样的荡妇。

Shinji's face was obviously showing rage but he tried to downplay it. Asuka paused here and took a deep and Shinji saw that she hesitated.  
真嗣的脸上明显带着愤怒，但他试图掩饰。明日香在这里停顿了一下，深吸一口气，真嗣注意到她犹豫了。

"Its okay if you don't want to continue."  
"如果你不想继续也没关系。"

Asuka shook her head, "I've buried this for so long. I'm rather glad to get it off my chest."  
明日香摇了摇头，"我埋藏这件事太久了。我很高兴能把它说出来。"

"You sure?" "你确定吗？"

Asuka nodded, and continued. "I had just turned ten, and was excited to get into the college, and get away from my father. He came back one night though, heavily drunk." Asuka's voice broke here and she started to shake uncontrollably. Shinji had never been in a situation like this before and wasn't sure how he should react.  
"明日香点点头，继续说道：“那时我刚满十岁，满心期待着进入大学，逃离父亲。但有一天晚上，他醉醺醺地回来了。”明日香的声音在这里哽咽了，她开始无法控制地颤抖。真嗣从未遇到过这种情况，不确定自己该如何反应。”

"M-My father attacked me in a drunken rage...he...he mistook me for my mother. For awhile...he had stopped abusing me...because I had called the police so...much that they were suspicious. He didn't...gi..give me a chance to get to the phone." Asuka then put both hands up to her face and mumbled, "He tried...t-to...ra-rape me."  
"“我父亲在酒醉中对我发起了攻击……他……他把我错当成了我母亲。有一段时间……他停止了对我的虐待……因为我多次报警……他们开始怀疑了。他没……给我机会去打电话。”明日香随后双手捂住脸，喃喃道，“他试图……对我……施暴。””

If Shinji had been clenching something it would have shattered. Boiling hatred the likes of which he never new surfaced. His hatred of his own father couldn't even compare to what he felt like doing to this bastard.  
"如果真嗣手里握着什么东西，那一定会被他捏碎。他从未感受过如此沸腾的仇恨。他对亲生父亲的恨意与之相比简直微不足道，他此刻只想对这个混蛋施以同样的报复。”

Asuka meanwhile had her faced buried in her hands and was crying silently. She had always built up a strong front, that she was invulnerable to anything. This though was something that she had always buried deep. Nobody knew about this except for the psychiatrist that she met frequently after her father had tried to rape her. Now Shinji knew.  
与此同时，明日香将脸埋在双手中，默默地哭泣。她总是筑起一道坚强的防线，仿佛无坚不摧。然而，这是她一直深藏心底的秘密。除了她父亲试图强奸她后频繁见面的心理医生，没有人知道这件事。现在，真嗣知道了。

Shinji looked helplessly back at Asuka who was still crying silently. What should he do? Ignore what she said and act as though it was in the past and everything was okay. Maybe if he was the Shinji from several weeks ago he would have. Now was different.  
真嗣无助地回头看向仍在默默哭泣的明日香。他该怎么办？无视她的话，假装一切都已过去，一切都没事了。或许如果是几周前的他，他会这么做。但现在不同了。

Without even hesitating he leaned his arm behind Asuka's back, which was easy as she was leaning forward with her face buried in her hands. At first he thought about patting her on the back, reassuring her that everything was okay. Instead though he decided to bring her into a comforting hug. Though it appeared that he didn't have to take the initiative as Asuka leaned into it as though waiting for his touch.  
他毫不犹豫地伸出胳膊，绕到明日香的背后，这很容易，因为她正向前倾，脸埋在双手中。起初，他想过轻拍她的背，安慰她一切都会好起来。然而，他决定给她一个安慰的拥抱。虽然看起来他不必主动，因为明日香似乎一直在等待他的触碰，自然而然地靠了过来。

Soon Shinji had his hands wrapped around Asuka's middle as she cried silently into his shoulder. "Its okay," he mumbled. She seemed glad that somebody was just there for her.  
"很快，真嗣的双手环绕在明日香腰间，她默默地靠在他的肩上哭泣。“没事的，”他喃喃道。她似乎很高兴有人在她身边。”

After several odd minutes for Shinji, Asuka pulled back as though realizing what she was doing. "Sorry you had to see that."  
"对真嗣来说，这几分钟显得格外漫长，明日香突然退开，仿佛意识到自己在做什么。“抱歉让你看到这一幕。””

"Don't feel bad about it. Nobody should have to carry something like that. Makes my sufferings seem like a joke."  
“别为此感到难过。没人应该背负这样的重担。相比之下，我的痛苦简直像个笑话。”

Asuka let out a small hiccup and put a hand to her mouth as though embarrassed by showing this much emotion. "You wont tell anyone, will you."  
明日香发出一声小小的呃逆，用手捂住嘴，似乎因流露出如此多的情感而感到尴尬。“你不会告诉任何人吧，会吗？”

Shinji shook his head, "I don't even want to think about it. I'm so mad I'd kill him if I saw him right now."  
真嗣摇了摇头，“我甚至不想去想这件事。我现在气得要是见到他，真想杀了他。”

"You'd have to beat me to it."  
“你得先过我这关。”

It felt weird that they could talk about something this disturbing so calmly. But Shinji knew otherwise, he knew that Asuka was hurting.  
他们能如此平静地讨论这样令人不安的事情，感觉很奇怪。但真嗣知道实情，他知道明日香正在受伤。

"We should probably get to bed," Shinji finally said.  
“我们或许该去睡觉了，”真嗣终于说道。

Asuka nodded her consent and sat up quickly as though determined that she was first to get to her room first. Shinji however caught her wrist, worried about her.  
明日香点头同意，迅速坐起身来，仿佛决心要第一个回到自己的房间。然而，真嗣抓住了她的手腕，担心着她。

"You're okay right?" “你没事吧？”

Asuka seemed to revert back to her normal self slightly as she said to Shinji, "What, thinking that I'll need somebody to sleep next to tonight?"  
明日香似乎稍微恢复了平时的样子，对真嗣说：“怎么，以为我今晚需要人陪睡吗？”

Shinji could have laughed, glad that she seemed to be back to her usual teasing self. Playing along he said, "Only if you want me to."  
真嗣差点笑出声来，很高兴她似乎又回到了平时爱捉弄人的状态。他顺着她的话说：“只要你愿意。”

"Get real. The day I let you sleep with me is the day Third Impact is initiated."  
"别做梦了。我让你上我的床的那天，就是第三次冲击启动的日子。"

"You better hope that never happens then."  
"那你最好祈祷那一天永远不会到来。"

Asuka's face turned pink slightly as she just realized the very real possibility of that happening. Marching back to her door she slid it open and slammed it closed with her foot.  
明日香的脸微微泛红，她刚刚意识到这种可能性确实存在。她快步走回自己的门前，拉开滑门，用脚砰地一声关上。

Shinji sighed at the obvious revert to her usual self. Though he hoped that things would have improved between them. Walking back to his room he opened the door and sat down on his futon, looking up at the ceiling. If only he knew that Asuka was doing the same thing.  
真嗣对着她明显恢复常态的样子叹了口气。尽管他希望他们之间的关系会有所改善。他走回自己的房间，打开门，坐在被褥上，抬头望着天花板。如果他知道明日香也在做同样的事情就好了。

Breakfast the next morning was subdued from the moment the two entered the kitchen. Misato realized that something must have happened last night between the two, because every time they looked at each other they quickly turned away.  
第二天早上的早餐从两人进入厨房的那一刻起就显得沉闷。美里意识到昨晚他们之间一定发生了什么，因为他们每次对视后都迅速移开目光。

"Well, I'm off to work, then. See you two later."  
“那么，我去上班了。再见，你们俩。”

Asuka and Shinji didn't even say anything, or nod for that matter. Shinji didn't want to bring up last night, or rather he wouldn't if Asuka didn't want him to. He really couldn't blame her.  
明日香和真嗣连一句话都没说，甚至连点头示意都没有。真嗣不想提起昨晚的事，或者说，如果明日香不想让他提，他就不会提。他真的不能怪她。

After a few minutes of silence Shinji said, "Lets get ready for school, I'll start making lunch."  
沉默了几分钟后，真嗣说道：“我们准备上学吧，我来开始做午饭。”

Asuka nodded and slid off her chair and slowly walked to her room to take a shower and change. Shinji sighed when she was no longer in view. Really he preferred the annoying, slightly bitchy Asuka to the one that he had to walk to school with.  
明日香点点头，从椅子上滑下来，慢慢走向她的房间去洗澡和换衣服。真嗣在她看不见之后叹了口气。说实话，他更喜欢那个有点烦人、有点泼辣的明日香，而不是现在这个和他一起走到学校的她。

After making their lunches Shinji waited for a while for Asuka to come out of her room fully dressed. However when he didn't even hear the sound of the shower running he walked over to her door and said quietly, "You ready?"  
做完午餐后，真嗣等了一会儿，希望明日香能穿好衣服从房间里出来。然而，当他连淋浴的声音都没听到时，他走到她的门前，轻声问道：“准备好了吗？”

What came back was her usual tone, "Leave me alone, baka."  
回应他的是她一贯的语气，“别烦我，笨蛋。”

Shinji sighed and leaned his back against the wall opposite her door. After a moments pause he said, "If you don't want to go to school just say so."  
真嗣叹了口气，背靠在她门对面的墙上。片刻停顿后，他说道：“如果你不想去学校，直说就好。”

Shinji thought he heard an intake of breath and then the release of the breath. "Fine..."  
真嗣以为他听到了一声吸气，随后是呼气声。“好吧……”

"I'll get the work that you'll miss."  
“我会完成你错过的那些工作。”

"Whatever." “随便。”

Shinji thought about opening the door to her room but was afraid that she might throw something at him. So he grabbed his lunch off the counter, turned around and whispered a small, "See you later," before walking out the door.  
真嗣考虑过打开她房间的门，但又害怕她会朝他扔东西。于是他拿起柜台上的午餐，转过身，轻声说了句“再见”，然后走出了门。

Asuka meanwhile had her face buried in her pillow, trying to forget about her past.  
与此同时，明日香把脸埋在枕头里，试图忘记她的过去。

School seemed rougher for some reason without Asuka with him. Maybe it was the fact that half the school seemed to think that they were going out and Asuka would kill them if they said anything bad to Shinji. So Shinji was battered with questions repeatedly about where Asuka was. At one point somebody asked where his bitch was, referring to Asuka. Shinji had almost smashed the guy's head on the sink fountain, but Kensuke pulled him away before he had a chance to.  
不知为何，没有明日香在身边，学校的生活似乎更加艰难。也许是因为学校里有一半人认为他们在交往，而明日香会杀了那些对真嗣说坏话的人。因此，真嗣不断被问及明日香在哪里。有一次，有人问他的婊子在哪里，指的是明日香。真嗣差点把那家伙的头撞到水池上，但健介及时把他拉开了。

So Shinji stormed up the stairs to the top of the school were he usually went for seclusion and was very annoyed that Kensuke was following him with a rather reluctant Touji behind him.  
于是真嗣气冲冲地跑上楼梯，来到学校顶楼，那是他常去寻求独处的地方，却非常恼火看到健介跟在他后面，而圭介则有些不情愿地跟在健介后面。

"Shinji what the fuck was that all about?" Kensuke rarely swore unless something was really bothering him.  
“真嗣，那他妈的到底是怎么回事？”健介很少骂人，除非真的有什么事让他很烦心。

"Shut it Kensuke!" “闭嘴，健介！”

"Ah did you two get in a fight," smirked Touji.  
“啊，你们俩吵架了？” 东治带着一丝嘲笑问道。

Shinji rounded on him, grabbed him by the front of his shirt and yelled, "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" These bastards couldn't understand the torment that Asuka was dealing with right now.  
真嗣转身面对他，抓住他的衬衫前襟大喊：“闭嘴！”这些混蛋根本不懂明日香现在正在经历的痛苦。

Touji seemed rather startled and took a few steps backwards as soon as Shinji let go of him. Shinji was a lot stronger then he had given him credit for.  
东治显得相当惊讶，一被真嗣放开就后退了几步。真嗣比他之前认为的要强得多。

"Damn, don't have to flip out over a stupid comment," said Touji.  
"该死，没必要因为一句蠢话就发飙吧，" 东治说道。

"You have no idea what your talking about so just shut the fuck up!"  
"你根本不知道自己在说什么，所以就他妈的闭嘴吧！"

"Ah, did you get her pregnant and now you've got to man-up because of it."  
"啊，你是不是把她搞怀孕了，现在得像个男人一样承担责任了。"

Shinji probably would have cracked Touji's skull open then if Rei didn't come walking onto the scene. To any normal person who saw what was going they would have ran to the nearest teacher and got the fight broken up. Rei however gave no noticed that Shinji was just about to kill someone and said calmly, "Shinji the principal wants to see us."  
如果不是绫波零恰巧走进现场，真嗣可能当时就真的把冬二的头骨打裂了。换作任何一个普通人看到这一幕，都会立刻跑去找最近的老师来制止这场斗殴。然而，绫波却似乎没注意到真嗣差点杀了人，只是平静地说道：“真嗣，校长要见我们。”

Shinji's face relaxed slightly as he looked back at her. "Both of us?"  
真嗣回头看向她，脸上的表情稍微缓和了一些。“我们两个都要去吗？”

Rei nodded silently, turned, and walked back down the flight of stairs.  
绫波默默地点了点头，转身走下了楼梯。

Shinji waited a few seconds, still deciding whether he should smash Touji's head in. After deciding the last thing he needed right now was expulsion, he gave both of them a disgusting look, and followed Rei at a brisk pace down the stairs.  
真嗣等了几秒钟，仍在犹豫是否应该砸烂冬二的脑袋。在决定眼下最不需要的就是被开除后，他给了他们一个厌恶的眼神，然后快步跟上绫波，走下楼梯。

After a hasty discussion with the principle, in which Shinji had learned that Misato had called the school when Asuka didn't answer hers, the two learned that an angel had appeared off the coast of China and had reduced the defense there to rubble.  
在与校长匆忙讨论后，真嗣得知美里在明日香没有接电话时联系了学校，两人得知一个使徒出现在中国沿海，并将那里的防御设施化为废墟。

Now the two of them were racing along in a Nerv jeep that had picked them up moments before. Shinji was tempted to run home really quick and grab Asuka, but decide that she didn't need a life or death battle right now.  
此刻，他们正乘坐一辆 NERV 的吉普车疾驰，这辆车在片刻前接上了他们。真嗣本想迅速跑回家带上明日香，但转念一想，她现在并不需要经历一场生死之战。

The entrance to the Geofront may have been ten miles away from school but the driver made in there in seven minutes. Shinji rolled out of the car and for once wishing that Misato had been driving. Rei jumped out of the jeep quite effortlessly and started trotting slightly towards the command center.  
虽然前往地底都市的入口离学校有十英里远，但司机仅用七分钟就到达了。真嗣从车里滚了出来，这次他竟然希望是美里在开车。绫波轻松地跳下吉普车，开始小跑着向指挥中心前进。

Misato greeted them and the gave them a few minor details. The angel seemed to be able detect when a hostile enemy approached and responded directly to that attack obliterating it in an instance. China apparently had discovered a weakness in its attack pattern though. A small window of three seconds appeared during which it wasn't able to use its positron particle beam. They were supposed to be aiming for that narrow window. Unit 00 would attack the target while Unit 01 would use a positron rifle to shoot it straight through the middle where the core was expected to be. Asuka was supposed to provide back up for Rei if anything happened but things had changed and Shinji was now pulled aside as Misato asked about Asuka.  
美里迎接了他们，并提供了一些细节。天使似乎能探测到敌意接近并直接回应攻击，瞬间将其消灭。不过，中国显然发现了其攻击模式中的一个弱点。在三秒钟的短暂窗口期内，它无法使用阳电子粒子束。他们应该瞄准这个狭窄的窗口。零号机将攻击目标，而初号机则使用阳电子步枪直接射击预计的核心位置。原本应该是明日香为绫波提供支援，但情况有变，真嗣被拉到一旁，美里询问关于明日香的事情。

"How come Asuka wasn't at school?"  
“为什么明日香不在学校？”

Shinji had just changed into his plug suit and was still trying to get used to the feeling of the fabric. Without averted his eyes from Misato he said, "She said she was sick, didn't feel well."  
真嗣刚刚换上他的插入栓服，还在努力适应布料的感觉。他没有将视线从美里身上移开，说道：“她说她生病了，感觉不太好。”

Misato frowned, "But why didn't you pick her up on the way here? Rei's job becomes much for dangerous without the backup from Asuka."  
美里皱起眉头，“但你为什么不在来的路上接她呢？没有明日香的支援，丽的工作会危险得多。”

Shrugging Shinji said, "I didn't think she'd be able to concentrate properly."  
真嗣耸了耸肩说：“我觉得她可能无法集中注意力。”

Misato frowned, "While I'm glad that you're worried about her, concentration isn't affected by temporary things like that."  
美里皱了皱眉，“虽然我很高兴你担心她，但专注力不会被那种短暂的事情影响。”

"I'll keep that in mind next time."  
“下次我会记住的。”

Shinji passed Misato without another word, while Misato was slightly surprised. Did she and Shinji just have there first argument?  
真嗣没再多说一句话就从美里身边走过，美里有些惊讶。难道她和真嗣刚刚第一次吵架了？

Soon Shinji was sent up elevator number five which would take him directly to the positron rifle. The angel, dubbed Ramiel, was hovering directly above Tokyo-3 as though waiting for something.  
很快，真嗣被送上了五号电梯，这将直接带他到达阳电子步枪处。被命名为雷米尔的天使正悬浮在第三新东京市上空，仿佛在等待着什么。

Shinji quickly adjusted the positron rifle and aimed his sights down at the target. "Misato I've got the angel in my sights."  
真嗣迅速调整了阳电子步枪，将瞄准镜对准目标。“美里，我已经锁定天使了。”

Misato didn't answer him at first but instead checked a monitor on the screen. It showed that Shinji's sync rate was currently holding steady at fifty-nine.  
美里起初没有回答他，而是检查了屏幕上的一个监视器。显示真嗣的同步率目前稳定在五十九。

'Well, he's improved so I suppose that I won't reprimand him for his attitude earlier,' thought Misato.  
'嗯，他进步了不少，我想我不会因为他早先的态度而责备他了，'Misato 心想。

Turning back towards the monitor she said, "Okay Shinji. We've got one shot at this before we have to recharge the rifle, so make it count."  
她转回监控器前，说道：“好了，真嗣。我们只有一次机会，之后就得给枪充电，所以务必命中。”

Shinji nodded and disengaged the radio from Misato. He needed to focus solely on hitting his target. Almost immediately thoughts of Asuka rushed through his head as he wondered how she was cooping back home. He was quick to push these thoughts aside though as he saw Rei take action.  
真嗣点点头，断开了与 Misato 的无线电联系。他需要全神贯注地击中目标。几乎立刻，关于明日香的思绪涌入脑海，他好奇她在家里是如何应对的。但他很快把这些念头抛开，因为看到绫波采取了行动。

Unit 00 dashed down the slope at break neck speed and charged head on at the angel. Sensing danger the angel quickly sent out a particle beam at Unit 00. Twisting around, Unit 00 jumped out of the way as the mass of energy flew past it, torching the earth behind it.  
零号机以惊人的速度冲下斜坡，直面天使发起冲锋。感受到威胁的天使迅速发射出一束粒子光束。零号机一个扭身，跳跃避开，那团能量擦身而过，将后方的大地烧焦。

Shinji knew that he would have only one chance and that he would have to choose it extremely carefully. He watched as Rei dodged another mass of energy.  
真嗣明白他只有一次机会，必须极其谨慎地选择。他看着绫波再次躲过一团能量。

Unit 00 started jumping from one spot to another, trying to get the angel to shoot at it. However the angel did not sense an immediate threat and paused once more.  
零号机开始从一个地点跳到另一个地点，试图引诱天使射击。然而，天使并未察觉到即刻的威胁，又一次停顿下来。

"I'm detecting high heat sources inside of the angel commander."  
"我检测到天使指挥官内部有高温热源。"

Misato spun around and quickly looked as the angel's heat parameters were put on screen.  
美里迅速转身，目光紧随着天使的热参数被投射到屏幕上。

Misato looked at it for a moment. It seemed as though the angel was building up a large amount energy at the very bottom of its body.  
美里凝视片刻，似乎天使正在其身体底部积蓄大量能量。

"Shit!" "该死！"

Everyone looked around the control room as Misato swore. Biting her nail she glared back at the monitor and thought, 'With that much energy built up, that angel will be able to puncture a hole directly to the Geofront.'  
当美里咒骂时，控制室里的每个人都环顾四周。她咬着指甲，怒视着监视器，心想：'能量积累到这种程度，那个使徒将能够直接穿透到地底都市。'

Grabbing a nearby headset she quickly yelled into it alerting Shinji and Rei, "Rei, Shinji, back off, we've got a problem."  
她抓起旁边的耳机，迅速向真嗣和丽喊道："丽，真嗣，撤退，我们有麻烦了。"

Shinji let out a giant breath as he was just mentally preparing himself to fire. Rei and Unit 00 quickly backed away to where Shinji and Unit 01 were laying down in the grass with the positron rifle.  
真嗣深吸了一口气，正准备开火。绫波和零号机迅速后退到真嗣和初号机所在的地方，他们正躺在草地上，手持阳电子步枪。

"What's wrong Misato?" “怎么了，美里？”

"I have no idea if its a problem or not but the angel is showing strong heat signatures at the lowest point of its body. If enough energy is built up the possibility of it tearing directly through the forty-five layers of steel to the Geofront."  
“我不确定这是否是个问题，但使徒在其身体最低点显示出强烈的热信号。如果能量积累足够，它有可能直接撕裂四十五层钢板，直达地底都市。”

Everyone was silent in the command center. Shinji didn't have enough knowledge of what was inside the Geofront to understand the severity of this.  
指挥中心内一片寂静。真嗣对地下都市的了解不足，无法理解这一情况的严重性。

"I want an estimate of how long we have until enough energy is built up to pierce the layers."  
“我要一个估计，看看我们还有多少时间，直到能量积累到足以穿透地层。”

"Umm judging by the power of an individual positron wave, the computer shows that we have ten minutes to stop the discharge."  
“呃，根据单个阳电子波的威力，电脑显示我们还有十分钟来阻止放电。”

"Shinji is the positron gun still ready."  
"真嗣，阳电子炮准备好了吗？"

"Hai." "嗨。"

"Good, ten minutes is a long time. Get to it. Rei, cover him, if the angel shows any signs of attacking Shinji."  
"很好，十分钟时间很充裕。开始吧。绫波，如果使徒有攻击真嗣的迹象，掩护他。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

Misato then sank down in her chair and let out a low sigh. 'I'm gonna need a long time at the bar to clear this one up.'  
美里随后坐回椅子上，低声叹息道：'看来我得在酒吧里待上好一阵子才能理清这事儿了。'

Shinji quickly readjusted his sights on the angel again and waited patiently for an opening.  
真嗣迅速重新调整瞄准天使的视线，耐心等待着机会。

Unit 00 charged again down the hill towards the angel. This time the angel, sensing danger, split itself into an exact replica. Two blue diamonds were now floating over Tokyo-3. The replica fire off a positron beam directly at Unit 00. Rei managed to roll out of the way as the positron beam flew over her.  
零号机再次冲下山坡，向天使发起冲锋。这次，天使察觉到了危险，分裂成了一个完全相同的复制品。两个蓝色钻石现在悬浮在第三新东京市上空。复制品发射出一道正电子光束，直奔零号机。绫波设法翻滚避开，正电子光束从她上方掠过。

Kicking up dirt as she skidded across the ground, Rei spun around and barely managed to dodge another wave as it almost tore off Unit 00's left arm. Running parallel on the side of a hill Unit 00 jumped in the air and went flying towards the replica of the angel. The replica fired off a positron wave which Rei was forced to roll over to avoid.  
绫波滑行在地面上，扬起尘土，转身时险些躲过另一波攻击，差点撕裂零号机的左臂。沿着山坡侧面并行奔跑，零号机一跃而起，向天使的复制品飞去。复制品发射出一道正电子波，绫波被迫翻滚躲避。

Unit 00 suddenly did a downward dive at the angel. The replica put forth an AT-field as Unit 00 neared it. Copying its enemy, Rei put forth the most power full AT-field that she could muster and ripped a small hole open in the replica's AT-field. Quick as a flash she drew the progressive knife in the shoulder holster of her Eva and threw it straight through the opening. The progressive knife made a deep puncture directly where the positron wave was fired.  
零号机突然向使徒俯冲下去。复制体在零号机接近时展开了 AT 力场。模仿对手，绫波竭尽全力展开了她所能施展的最强 AT 力场，并在复制体的 AT 力场上撕开了一个小洞。她迅速从 Eva 肩部的枪套中抽出高频刀，径直穿过那个缺口投掷过去。高频刀深深刺入了正发射阳电子波的位置。

Suddenly the angel let out an ear splitting shriek that sounded like finger nails on a chalk bored. A white light appeared from inside the replica and soon filled the entire of Tokyo-3 in a blinding white light. Then, it started to fall apart. The white turn to black instantly and the seemed to be falling apart, piece by piece, almost as if it was a puzzle. The replica imploded on itself and showered Tokyo-3 in small droplets of black blood.  
突然，使徒发出了一声刺耳的尖叫，听起来像是用指甲刮擦黑板。一道白光从复制体内部发出，很快整个第三新东京市都被这耀眼的白光笼罩。随后，它开始崩解。白色瞬间转为黑色，仿佛一块块拼图般，一片片地崩落。复制体自我坍缩，将第三新东京市洒满了黑色的血滴。

Shinji's concentration was halted for a second as he watched this all unfold but heard Misato yelling something.  
这一切的发生让真嗣的注意力中断了一瞬，但他听到了美里在喊些什么。

"Six minutes until penetration, and what the hell happened to the angel."  
"还有六分钟就要穿透了，天使到底怎么了。"

Shinji did a double take and looked down the barrel of the positron rifle. She was right! The angel had disappeared, most likely when the replica had imploded and blinded everyone.  
真嗣定睛一看，顺着阳电子步枪的枪管望去。她说得没错！天使不见了，很可能是在复制体坍缩并让所有人失明的时候消失的。

"Kuso! Where is it!" "该死！它去哪儿了！"

Looking wildly around Shinji tried to get a fix on the angel's position.  
真嗣疯狂地环顾四周，试图确定使徒的位置。

"Large heat source directly behind Unit 01, commander," said an operative.  
“指挥官，Unit 01 正后方有大型热源，”一名操作员报告道。

Without even thinking Misato yelled, "Shinji get out of there!"  
米莎毫不犹豫地大喊：“真嗣，快离开那里！”

Shinji didn't even hesitated, and Unit 01 rolled to its left as a particle wave melted the rifle which was their only source of hope. Shinji rolled out of the way as another wave barely missed him. Kicking up off the ground he was greeted by a giant shadow that was hovering directly above him.  
真嗣毫不犹豫，初号机向左翻滚，一道粒子波瞬间融化了他们唯一的希望——那把步枪。真嗣一个翻滚躲开另一道几乎擦身而过的波束。他一脚蹬地跃起，迎面而来的是一个巨大的阴影，正悬停在他正上方。

Shinji had never really experienced true fear until now. Every other time that he had been inside an Eva he had reacted on his emotions, or let the voice fix it for him. This time though, time seemed to freeze itself as he saw the particle wave coming at him in slow motion. Moving didn't even seem to register in his mind until the last moment when it seemed pointless.  
真嗣从未真正体验过此刻的恐惧。以往每次驾驶 EVA 时，他都是凭情绪行事，或是让内心的声音替他解决。但这一次，时间仿佛凝固，他眼看着粒子波以慢动作袭来，移动的念头直到最后一刻才在脑海中闪现，似乎已毫无意义。

Rei appeared directly in front of the angel with a heat shield and blocked the full force of the attack. Deploying her AT-field to the limit she was able to defend Shinji for a certain amount of time.  
绫波丽直接出现在使徒面前，展开热盾挡下了攻击的全部威力。她将 AT 力场发挥到极限，为真嗣争取了一定的时间。

Shinji didn't even move, couldn't for some reason. This selfless act of throwing your life away in the way to protect somebody was chivalrous.  
真嗣甚至没有动弹，不知为何无法动弹。这种无私地牺牲自己生命以保护他人的行为，是骑士精神的体现。

"...Rei..." He didn't expect a response but he got one nonetheless.  
"...绫波..." 他并未期待回应，但仍然得到了回应。

"Ikari...kun." "碇...君。"

Shinji froze, it was the first time that she had said his name. Realizing where he was and how stupid he was be he stood up next to Rei and deployed his own AT-field to the limit. The combination was enough to shatter the angels own AT-field and halt its attack for a moment.  
真嗣愣住了，这是她第一次叫他的名字。意识到自己的处境以及有多愚蠢，他站到绫波身边，将自己的 AT 力场发挥到极限。两者的结合足以粉碎天使的 AT 力场，并暂时阻止了它的攻击。

Turning around the two sprinted down the bank and quickly ducked down behind some buildings. Shinji took a quick look at Unit 00's arms. If he had stopped her in time the arm might be gone. The heat shield was melted to an indistinguishable wad of mental, and the hand that held it was slightly twisted. Shinji couldn't imagine what the temperature inside the entry plug had been.  
两人转身沿着河岸疾跑，迅速躲到一些建筑物后面。真嗣快速看了一眼零号机的手臂。如果他及时阻止了她，那手臂可能已经消失了。热盾被熔成了一团难以辨认的金属块，握着它的手也有些扭曲。真嗣无法想象插入栓内的温度有多高。

"You okay, Rei?" His voice held general concern.  
“你还好吗，绫波？”他的声音中带着普遍的关切。

Silence from her entry plug for a minute in which Shinji started to get worried, then he heard a small voice.  
从她的插入栓里沉默了一分钟，这让真嗣开始感到担忧，随后他听到了一个微弱的声音。

"Yes, I am." “是的，我在。”

"Good. I'm glad." “太好了。我很高兴。”

"You're glad." It wasn't a question, it was a statement.  
"你很高兴。" 这不是一个问句，而是一个陈述。

"Course I'm glad. You're a friend, if something happens to you I'd be worried."  
"当然高兴。你是朋友，如果你出了什么事，我会担心的。"

Rei was silent for a moment and the said, "Friend?"  
丽沉默了一会儿，然后说："朋友？"

"Yeah, you an Asuka are both my friends."  
“是啊，你和明日香都是我的朋友。”

Before either of them could say a word a positron wave tore straight through the building in between them. Rei and Shinji jumped backwards as they saw the angel slowly coming nearer, a faint glow now underneath it.  
在他们能说出一个字之前，一股阳电子波直接穿透了他们之间的建筑物。真嗣和绫波跳向后方，看到天使缓缓靠近，其下方隐约发出微光。

"Damn it, only three minutes left." Shinji looked wildly around for something that might be able to help them...with out much luck. So he did the only thing that he knew that had a chance of working. Concentrating deeply he reached into the very depths of his subconscious. He felt nothing but the LCL fluid around him and inhaled deeply, taking in the smell of blood which he would likely never get used to.  
“该死，只剩三分钟了。”真嗣疯狂地四处寻找可能帮助他们的东西……但运气不佳。于是他做了唯一知道有可能奏效的事。他深吸一口气，集中精神，深入到潜意识的深处。他只感觉到周围的 LCL 液体，深吸一口气，闻到了血腥味，这味道他可能永远都无法习惯。

"Unit 01's sync rate is climbing!"  
"初号机的同步率正在上升！"

Misato stopped biting her nail and looked wildly around. "What!"  
美里停止咬指甲，慌乱地四处张望。“什么！”

"The pilot of Unit 01 is syncing perfectly with Unit 01. Sync rate climbing, sixty-one...no sixty-two...sixty-three."  
"初号机的驾驶员与机体同步率完美匹配。同步率上升，六十一……不，六十二……六十三。"

Misato watched, surprised at Shinji's sudden improvement. 'Is this what happens when he actually tries,' she wondered?  
美里惊讶地看着真嗣突然的进步。'这就是他真正努力时的样子吗？'她暗自思忖。

As Shinji opened his eyes he felt the LCL fluid change. It was comfortable now for him, as though he had always belonged there. The temperature had changed also. It was warm not, like a giant quilt that was tossed over him, and he didn't even seem to taste the blood anymore.  
当真嗣睁开眼睛时，他感觉到 LCL 液体的变化。现在对他来说很舒适，仿佛他一直属于那里。温度也变了，现在温暖如同一床巨大的被子盖在他身上，他甚至不再尝到血液的味道。

"What happened?" “发生了什么？”

"_You finally accepted the Eva and in doing so the Eva has accepted you."_  
"你终于接受了 Eva，而 Eva 也因此接受了你。"

"How come you weren't with me the entire time?"  
"为什么你不是一直陪在我身边？"

"_Sad that I wasn't giving you instruction?"_  
"因为我没有一直在指导你而感到难过吗？"

"Not really. Just that whenever I've had a problem you've taken over."  
"并不是真的。只是每次我有问题时，你总是接手处理。"

"_I wanted you to have to deal with it on your own. You did better than I expected actually."_  
"我希望你能自己解决。实际上，你做得比我想象的还要好。"

"Great, well I need help now!"  
"太好了，现在我需要帮助！"

"_You sure you want to go through with this?"_  
"你确定要这么做吗？"

"Of course, even if I end up in the infirmary again."  
"当然，即使我再次进医务室。"

"_Thats what I like to hear."_  
"我就喜欢你这种精神。"

Shinji was prepared for it this time but it still freaked him out. Nerves from the Eva snaked its way along his skin, piercing into him and connecting with his own nerves. Next he felt like a white, hot poker, pierced into the side of his temples. Droplets of blood leaked from the small holes in his skin and soon blended with the LCL fluid. Strangely the smell of the LCL fluid and his own blood seemed to relax him. Almost as if the two blending together harmonized with him.  
这次真嗣有所准备，但仍感到惊慌。Eva 的神经沿着他的皮肤蜿蜒，刺入他的体内，与他的神经相连。接着，他感觉像是被一根白热的拨火棍刺入太阳穴。血滴从皮肤上的小孔中渗出，很快与 LCL 液体混合。奇怪的是，LCL 液体的气味和他自己的血混合在一起，似乎让他放松了。仿佛这两者融合在一起，与他产生了和谐共鸣。

"_Blood pressure normal. LCL fluid density has been changed. How does it feel?"_  
“血压正常。LCL 液体密度已调整。感觉如何？”

"Right...somehow." “还行……算是吧。”

"_Good, you're getting used to it."_  
"很好，你已经习惯了。"

"I still feel disgusted by it."  
"我还是觉得恶心。"

"_You really should be used to it by now."_  
"你现在真的应该习惯了。"

"Forget it!" "算了吧！"

"..._Fine_." "……好吧。"

Unit 01 shuddered violently as it let out a violent roar, ripping apart the bracers that secured the mouth shut. Arching its back, it got down on all fours and kicked off against the ground, ripping apart the ground as it charged. Shinji felt as though had something had grabbed him behind the collar and jerked him backwards at the sudden change of movement. He wasn't even in control anymore.  
初号机剧烈颤抖着，发出一声狂暴的咆哮，撕裂了固定嘴巴的支架。它弓起背，四肢着地，猛地蹬地向前冲去，地面被撕裂开来。随着突如其来的动作变化，真嗣感觉像是有人抓住了他的后领猛地向后一拽。他甚至已经无法控制自己了。

Jumping through the air, Unit 01 raised both its fists and brought them down on the angels AT-field. Letting out an earsplitting roar it repeated bashed its fists against the AT-field.  
跃入空中，01 号机双拳高举，猛地砸向天使的 AT 力场。伴随着震耳欲聋的咆哮，它不断用拳头猛击 AT 力场。

"_Help me out here. I need you to concentrate."_  
“帮我一把，集中精神。”

"I'm trying, damn it!" “我在努力，该死！”

"_Well try harder."_ “那就再努力些。”

Shinji concentrated harder and felt the LCL fluid change drastically. The controls inside the entry plug disintegrated and changed into LCL fluid. Then Shinji felt a burning sensation start at his feat and creep up to his head. His plug suit was slowly dissolving. Soon Shinji was completely naked and floating inside the entry plug with nothing holding him except the nerves of the Eva.  
真嗣更加集中精神，感觉到 LCL 液体发生了剧烈变化。插入栓内的控制装置分解并转化为 LCL 液体。随后，真嗣感到一种灼热感从脚底开始蔓延至头部。他的驾驶服正在慢慢溶解。不久，真嗣便完全赤裸，仅靠 EVA 的神经悬浮在插入栓内。

Unable to move his body he thought in his mind.  
身体无法动弹，他在心中思索着。

'What is this?' “这是什么？”

'_True synchronization.'_ “真正的同步。”

Unit 01 then stopped attacking sporadically and jumped backwards, glaring at the angel, almost like it had a mind now. Shinji then projected his thoughts in his own mind which were received by the Eva, via the connected nerves. Unit 01 then took off again, charging at the angel. This time though, instead of attacking randomly, it smashed its fists into the AT-field of the angel. Unit 01 quickly generated its own AT-field and attempted to rip apart the angels own AT-field.  
初号机随即停止了零星的攻击，向后一跃，瞪着使徒，仿佛此刻它也有了意识。真嗣在心中投射出自己的想法，通过连接的神经被 EVA 接收。初号机再次启动，向使徒冲去。这一次，它没有盲目攻击，而是用拳头猛击使徒的 AT 力场。初号机迅速生成自己的 AT 力场，试图撕裂使徒的 AT 力场。

Digging its nails into the angels AT-field it was able to open up a small hole. Quickly thrusting its head into the hole it let out a roar that shattered the remains of the angels AT-field. Quick as a flash, Unit 01 smashed both its fists into the side of the angel. The angel seemed to crumble slightly as Unit 01 repeatedly smashed its fists directly into the side of the angel.  
它用指甲刺入天使的 AT 力场，成功撕开了一个小洞。迅速将头探入洞中，发出一声咆哮，震碎了天使剩余的 AT 力场。零一机敏如闪电，双拳猛击天使的侧面。天使似乎微微崩塌，零一不断用拳头直接击打天使的侧面。

As Unit 01 was about to smash its fists into the side of the angel again, the angel quickly shifted so that it was able to fire its positron wave. A quick red flash appeared as the angel fired. Shinji reacted quicker though. Putting all his thoughts into the Eva's AT-field he projected a cone like AT-field which deflected the attack and sent it back towards the angel. The angel was able to deflect it though by firing another positron wave, make the first veer of course. That was all Shinji needed.  
正当零一准备再次用拳头击打天使的侧面时，天使迅速移动，发射出正电子波。一道快速的红光闪现，天使开火了。但真嗣反应更快。他将所有思绪集中在 EVA 的 AT 力场上，投射出一个锥形 AT 力场，将攻击偏转并反弹回天使。天使虽然通过发射另一道正电子波改变了第一道波的轨迹，但这正是真嗣所需要的。

Reacting to the three second window, Unit 01 quickly appeared in front of the angel, grabbing both sides of it. Gripping the sides of the angel, Unit 01 dug its fingers into the angel and by projecting a large AT-field between the two hands, tour off a large chunk of the angel. Black blood poured from the open wound and several large organs, caked with a substance like bone marrow, fell to the ground.  
在三秒窗口期内，初号机迅速出现在使徒面前，双手紧抓其两侧。初号机用手指深深嵌入使徒体内，通过在双手间投射出巨大的 AT 力场，撕下了一大块使徒的肉体。黑色的血液从撕裂的伤口中涌出，几块沾满类似骨髓物质的巨大器官也随之坠地。

Unit 01 let out a ferocious roar as it thrust its head directly into the open wound. Flesh and blood poured forth as Unit 01 dug inside the body of the angel. Shinji was slightly repulsed as he could feel the slimy taste of the flesh and the iron like blood pouring through his mouth, but he had to find it.  
初号机发出一声凶猛的咆哮，将头部直接插入那敞开的伤口中。血肉横飞，初号机深入使徒体内挖掘。真嗣感到一丝恶心，他能感受到那滑腻的肉质和铁锈般的血液涌入口中，但他必须找到那个东西。

After a few seconds of digging Unit 01 paused and ripped its head out the wound of the angel. The head was dripping in blood and some was pouring from the mouth. Something was in its mouth though, a red object that looked similar to a marble. With a quick clench of the teeth the red marble shattered and fell from the Eva's teeth.  
挖掘了几秒钟后，初号机停顿了一下，猛地将头从使徒的伤口中抽出。头部滴着血，有些血从口中流出。但它的嘴里确实含着什么，一个红色的物体，看起来像颗玛瑙。随着牙齿的迅速一咬，红色玛瑙碎裂，从 EVA 的齿间掉落。

With the core of the angel removed and destroyed the angel seemed to twist and writhe. Large chunks of flesh started to fall off and sink to the ground. Shinji watched this all in slow motion from the eyes of the Eva.  
随着天使的核心被移除并摧毁，天使似乎开始扭曲和蠕动。大块的肉体开始脱落并沉向地面。真嗣通过 Eva 的眼睛，以慢动作目睹了这一切。

"Pattern blue has disappeared, the angel has been defeated."  
「蓝色模式已消失，天使已被击败。」

Misato let out a shaky laugh and sank in her chair. She didn't even want to know how much time was left. Shinji's performance was incredible though. His sync rate read at seventy-two when he had disengaged combat. Even so the way he initiated combat was both reckless, and slightly scary. He didn't seem to show any emotion.  
美里发出颤抖的笑声，瘫坐在椅子上。她甚至不想知道还剩下多少时间。尽管如此，真嗣的表现还是令人难以置信。他在脱离战斗时的同步率达到了七十二。尽管如此，他发起战斗的方式既鲁莽又略显可怕。他似乎没有表现出任何情感。

Letting out a low sigh Misato said, "Bring in Unit 00 and 01, and get the has-mat team down there to start clean up." 'And get me a cold beer while your at it,' she thought.  
美里低声叹了口气，说道：“把零号机和初号机带进来，让防化小组下去开始清理。”她心里想着：‘顺便给我拿瓶冰啤酒。’

Shinji was rather hesitant as he stood outside of Misato's apartment, and rather mad at the conversation that had followed after he returned from fighting. Misato had scolded him about his way of fighting, saying that he was way to reckless and should have waited for back up from Rei. Shinji had retorted that he had defeated the angel so why should she be angry at him. He was honestly annoyed with Misato right now, but he was more worried about Asuka. She had to assume that something had happened judging by that fact that Shinji hadn't come home from school.  
真嗣站在美里的公寓外，相当犹豫，对战斗结束后发生的那场对话感到愤怒。美里责备他的战斗方式，说他太过鲁莽，应该等丽来支援。真嗣反驳说他已经打败了使徒，为什么她还要对他生气。他现在确实对美里感到恼火，但他更担心明日香。考虑到真嗣放学后还没回家，她不得不认为发生了什么事。

He was hoping that she might have gone to bed early and opened the door slowly hoping that he wouldn't wake her if she was asleep. However, when he opened the door he heard the blaring of the T.V. and assumed that she was still up. Tiptoeing his way into the living room he saw that Asuka was sprawled on the ground, with her head resting on a pillow, and entangled in a pile of blankets. At first he thought that she was sleeping but then he noticed that she had her head propped up in her hands.  
他希望她可能已经早早上床，于是慢慢地打开门，希望如果她在睡觉的话不会吵醒她。然而，当他打开门时，他听到了电视的轰鸣声，猜想她应该还没睡。他蹑手蹑脚地走进客厅，看到明日香四肢摊开躺在地上，头枕着一个枕头，被一堆毯子缠绕着。起初他以为她在睡觉，但随后注意到她用手撑着头。

She must have heard the door open because she sat up slowly, letting the blankets slide off her body, and turned towards the hallway where Shinji was standing. Shinji tried not to stare to much but it was rather difficult. She was wearing a white, loose, tank-top, with white and blue striped underwear, and appeared to have been laying there for a while. Rubbing her eyes slowly she squinted in Shinji's general direction.  
她一定是听到了开门声，因为她慢慢地坐了起来，让毯子从身上滑落，转向信二站立的走廊。信二尽量不盯着她看，但这相当困难。她穿着一件宽松的白色背心，搭配蓝白条纹的内裤，看起来已经在那里躺了一段时间。她慢慢地揉着眼睛，眯着眼睛朝信二的大致方向看去。

"Baka Shinji?" “笨蛋信二？”

"Yeah, and could you drop the baka?"  
"是啊，你能别再叫我笨蛋了吗？"

Asuka shrugged and went back to watching television. Shinji wasn't sure if he should go straight to sleep or risk an argument with her. Deciding that they were on friendly level and that he didn't want to break it he inched his way towards his room when he heard her accusing voice.  
明日香耸了耸肩，继续看电视。真嗣不确定自己是该直接睡觉，还是冒险和她争论。考虑到他们目前关系还算友好，他不想破坏这种状态，于是小心翼翼地朝自己的房间挪去，这时他听到了她责问的声音。

"Where are you going?" "你要去哪儿？"

Shinji paused for a second and said, "To bed. I'm sorta tired."  
真嗣顿了一下，说道：“去睡觉。我有点累了。”

Stealing a quick glance at the living room he saw that Asuka still hadn't moved.  
他迅速瞥了一眼客厅，看到明日香仍然没有动。

"You can go to bed later. I want to know why you fought the angel without me."  
“你可以晚点再睡。我想知道你为什么在没有我的情况下与使徒战斗。”

Shinji flinched. Of course she would have known about the angel attack. The JSDF would have announced something completely false was happening and that everyone had to evacuate to the shelters. Asuka would of course known that it was really an angel attack.  
真嗣畏缩了一下。她当然知道使徒袭击的事。日本自卫队肯定会宣布发生了完全虚假的事件，要求所有人撤离到避难所。明日香自然知道那实际上是使徒的攻击。

"Oh...that..." “哦...那个...”

"Oh that? Is that all you can say?"  
“哦，那个？你就只能说这个吗？”

"Can't you at least be a little thankful?"  
"你就不能至少表示一点感激吗？"

"For what!" "为了什么！"

"Look, you didn't go to school so I didn't think that you'd be able fight well enough. When Misato asked me where you were I said that you were sick and not feeling well."  
"听着，你没去上学，所以我没想到你能打得那么好。当美里问我你在哪儿时，我说你生病了，感觉不舒服。"

"That doesn't affect the synchro-"  
"那不会影响同步率——"

"I know! ...I was just looking out for you is all, because of last nig-"  
"我知道！……我只是关心你，因为昨晚的事——"

Shinji caught himself in mid sentence. Certainly mention of last night would set her off.  
真嗣话说到一半突然打住。提到昨晚的事肯定会惹她生气。

Asuka was frowning at Shinji, rather curiously. Shrugging she said, "Well it was rather relaxing anyway, and I certainly deserved the day off."  
明日香正皱着眉头好奇地看着真嗣。她耸耸肩说：“反正挺放松的，我确实该休息一天。”

Standing up she walked over to Shinji and had to tilt her head slightly up towards him. She just realized that he was slightly taller than her, though they were both the same age. "Don't let it happen again though." At her words she calmly extended her index finger and flicked it against his nose, catching Shinji completely off guard.  
她站起来，走到真嗣面前，不得不稍微抬头看他。她这才意识到他比自己稍高一些，尽管他们同龄。“不过别再有下次了。”她平静地伸出食指，轻轻弹了一下他的鼻子，真嗣完全没料到这一招。

Asuka turned around, her hair brushing against Shinji's face, and crawled back into the blankets.  
明日香转过身去，头发拂过真嗣的脸颊，然后钻回了被窝里。

Shinji continued standing there as though he was frozen. He had seriously thought that she was about to kiss him.  
真嗣继续站在那里，仿佛被冻住了一般。他真的以为她要吻他了。

After several seconds in which time seemed to freeze for Shinji, Asuka turned towards Shinji and frowned. "What's wrong with you?"  
在几秒钟的时间里，时间似乎对真嗣来说凝固了，明日香转向真嗣并皱起了眉头。“你怎么了？”

Shinji seemed to come out of his stupor and nervously said, "Nothing."  
真嗣似乎从恍惚中回过神来，紧张地说：“没什么。”

"Liar, you thought I was going to kiss you."  
"骗子，你以为我要吻你。"

Shinji blushed a deep crimson and waved his hands in front of his face, "No, I don't think of you like that."  
真嗣的脸颊涨得通红，双手在脸前挥舞着，"不，我没那么想你。"

Asuka rolled her eyes and turned back towards the T.V. "Grow some balls and start thinking like that then."  
明日香翻了个白眼，转身面向电视，"长点胆子，就该那么想。"

Shinji sighed and said, "What, you want me to think like that?"  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“什么，你想让我那样想吗？”

It was Asuka's turn to be embarrassed as she quickly turned around before Shinji could see the pink tinge that had appeared on her face.  
轮到明日香感到尴尬了，她迅速转过身去，以免真嗣看到她脸上泛起的粉红色。

"Baka, just go to sleep already."  
“笨蛋，快去睡觉吧。”

"Yeah, yeah, I'm going." “是是，我这就走。”

Asuka kept her gaze fixed on the T.V. as Shinji left the room. When she heard his door closed she let out a low sigh and rolled over onto her back. Several emotion coursed through her which she didn't recognize, and all of them had something to do with Shinji. Turning off the T.V. she sat up and ran her hands through her hair. A small smile had appeared on her face.  
碇真嗣离开房间时，明日香目光依旧紧盯着电视。听到他的房门关闭声，她轻轻叹了口气，翻身仰躺。心中涌动着她辨认不清的情感，而这些情感无一不与真嗣有关。她关掉电视，坐起身来，双手穿过发丝，嘴角浮现出一抹淡淡的微笑。

**Okay I'm posting this in a motor home as we drive through town stealing internet as we go. As you'll notice I've taken a lot of liberties with some things here and there. And sorry if there's bad grammar in this one. When I've got time I'll fix it.

### Chapter 7: Partners

**Phew...got another done. You'll noticed I changed some stuff (again). On another note I figured that I'd get something sorted out before it was brought up. I've flip flopped with the idea of adding lemon into this sometime or another. I even planned out half a chapter in my head after Asuka and Shinji having sex and the repercussions that followed. Though I decided to scrap the whole idea and leave it for later, and by later I mean the sequel to this. In this Shinji and Asuka are one year older than they were in the anime and I decided on this age largely because of the dialogue between the teenagers (You'll notice how vulgar it can get at times). So if you were hoping for lemon in this I hate to disappoint you but lemon between two fifteen year olds is a gigantic no no in my world. BTW sequel will be named Two of Us, and if you can guess were I got the name from...well then you're as much a fan of them as I am. And close curtain.  
呼...又完成了一章。你会发现我又改了一些内容（再次）。另一方面，我想在问题被提出之前先理清一些事情。我一直在犹豫是否要在某个时候在这部作品中加入柠檬（即情色内容）。我甚至在脑海中构思了半章，讲述明日香和真嗣发生关系后的后果。不过我最终决定放弃这个想法，留待以后再说，这里的“以后”指的是这部作品的续集。在这部作品中，真嗣和明日香比动画中大一岁，我选择这个年龄主要是因为青少年之间的对话（你会注意到有时会变得多么粗俗）。所以，如果你期待在这部作品中看到情色内容，我很抱歉让你失望了，但在我的世界里，两个十五岁的孩子之间的情色内容是绝对禁止的。顺便说一下，续集将命名为《我们俩》，如果你能猜到我从哪里得到这个名字的...那么你和我一样是他们的粉丝。然后，拉上帷幕。**

Gendo Ikari sat calmly at his desk. It was close to midnight and he had just finished reading the report that Ritsuko had given him about Pilot 01's latest improvement. Shinji's sudden improvement both brought his plan closer, but also brought greater dangers to his plan. If he should go out of control again, well, Instrumentality might be initiated sooner then he might like it, and while he knew he could control Shinji if he wished, he still didn't have all the pieces.  
碇源堂平静地坐在他的办公桌前。时间已近午夜，他刚刚读完赤木律子交给他的关于驾驶员 01 最新进步的报告。真嗣的突然进步不仅使他的计划更近一步，同时也给他的计划带来了更大的危险。如果他再次失控，那么，人类补完计划可能会比他希望的更早启动，尽管他知道自己如果愿意，可以控制住真嗣，但他仍然没有掌握所有关键因素。

Clasping his hands together he glanced down at the brief that Ritsuko had sent him. The woman may be completely useless in the future, but for now he would be able to control her to his designs.  
他将双手合十，瞥了一眼赤木律子发给他的简报。这个女人将来可能完全无用，但目前他还能按照自己的设计控制她。

Picking a particular paper up he glanced at the few words she had left in the margins at the end of it. 'While Shinji's sync rate has increased dramatically he seems to have grown slightly aggressor. While that may be due to his experiences inside Unit-01, I don't know. An odd thing came up during the analysis of his battle though. During the time when Unit 01 generated the AT-field that tore the angel in half a brief instance of two At-fields were noticeable between the hands. It is possible though that this was the angel's AT-field and that the computer misread it.'  
他拿起一张特定的文件，瞥了一眼她在页边留下的几句话。'虽然真嗣的同步率显著提升，但他似乎变得有些好斗。这可能是由于他在初号机内的经历所致，我不确定。但在分析他的战斗时，出现了一件奇怪的事情。在初号机生成 AT 力场将使徒撕成两半的时刻，双手间短暂出现了两个 AT 力场的迹象。虽然这可能是使徒的 AT 力场，计算机误读了它。'

Gendo let the paper fall back on his desk and rested his elbows on the edge of his desk. He had wondered whether Ritsuko would have noticed this anomaly. The kid had undoubtably grown, but still not to where he could be useful. Well, he could still wait.  
碇源堂让文件重新落回桌面，双肘撑在桌沿。他曾怀疑过赤木律子是否注意到了这个异常。那孩子无疑成长了，但仍未达到能派上用场的地步。不过，他还可以等待。

A small smile appeared on Gendo's face as he anticipated the future.  
碇源堂脸上浮现出一丝微笑，期待着未来。

When Shinji woke up the day after his fight with the angel Ramiel he thought that he was still dreaming. Never in his life would he have expected to smell food in Misato's apartment that wasn't being made by his own hands. Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes to be sure he wasn't dreaming only to realize how foolishly it was to rub your eyes if it was something you were smelling.  
当真嗣在与天使拉米尔战斗后的第二天醒来时，他以为自己还在做梦。他从未想过会在美里小姐的公寓里闻到不是自己亲手做的食物。坐起身来，他揉了揉眼睛，确认自己不是在做梦，却意识到如果闻到的是气味，揉眼睛是多么愚蠢的行为。

Standing up groggily, still half asleep, he opened the door a little and stuck his head into the doorway. He could smell something wonderful coming from the kitchen but due to the odd design of the apartment couldn't see who it was. It certainly couldn't have been Misato...the house would have burned long ago, and Asuka wouldn't be caught dead making something for herself. So who did that leave?  
他昏昏沉沉地站起来，还半睡半醒，轻轻推开门，探出头去。他闻到厨房里飘来一股美妙的味道，但由于公寓的奇特设计，他看不到是谁在做饭。当然不可能是美里……房子早就烧起来了，而明日香绝不会屈尊为自己做饭。那么，还能是谁呢？

Keeping his body pressed firmly against the wall of the hallway he slowly walked forward and into the kitchen. In his surprise he almost tripped over his own feet and fell flat on his face. It was Asuka, though she certainly didn't seem like Asuka.  
他紧紧贴着走廊的墙壁，慢慢向前走，进入了厨房。他惊讶得差点绊倒自己，脸朝下摔倒。是明日香，但她看起来一点也不像明日香。

She was facing the stove and seemed to be fretting over the dials, trying to figure out how to work them. Once or twice Shinji thought he heard her say, "How the hell does that baka use this damn thing?"  
她正对着炉子，似乎在为那些旋钮烦恼，试图弄清楚如何操作。一两次，真嗣觉得他听到她在说：“那个笨蛋到底是怎么用这该死的东西的？”

She had her hair tied back in a pony tail, something that Shinji never expected to see but had to admit it looked good. Shinji then noticed that she had found the white apron that he occasionally used when he didn't want to get his clothes dirty. Though last time he wore it he could have sworn it had a stain on it.  
她的头发扎成了马尾，这是真嗣从未预料到的，但他不得不承认这样看起来不错。真嗣随后注意到她找到了他偶尔会用的白色围裙，以免弄脏衣服。尽管上次他穿的时候，他发誓上面有个污渍。

It seemed that she had found the correct setting for the stove and Shinji then saw that she seemed to be pouring some sort of bater in a frying pan. His mind ran through a series of things that she could be cooking before it rested on pancakes. He was rather surprised that she would be making something so plain. He had made them a few times before and she had always eaten them with little or no complaints. So why should she be making them now?  
看来她已经找到了炉子的正确设置，真嗣随后看到她似乎在向煎锅里倒某种面糊。他的脑海中闪过一系列她可能正在烹饪的东西，最终停留在煎饼上。他相当惊讶她会做这么简单的东西。他之前做过几次，她总是吃得不多，几乎没有抱怨。那么她现在为什么要做呢？

Abandoning all pretenses he calmly walked the rest of the way into the kitchen and sat down at the table there. He wondered how long it would take her to realize that he was there, she seemed completely focused on the stove. After a minute of silence Shinji breached it.  
他放下所有伪装，平静地走进厨房，坐在那里的餐桌旁。他好奇她要多久才能意识到他在那里，她似乎完全专注于炉子。沉默了一分钟后，真嗣打破了沉默。

"You're certainly up early."  
“你今天起得真早。”

Asuka almost jumped three feet in the air at his comment and almost knocked the pan of the stove. Spinning around quickly she saw him sitting at the table grinning at her. Quickly hiding the brief tinge of pink that had appeared on her cheeks because of her actions she retorted, "Damn it, you almost made me spill the frying pan."  
听到他的话，明日香几乎跳了起来，差点把锅从炉子上撞下来。她迅速转身，看到他坐在桌旁，对着她咧嘴笑。她迅速掩饰住因自己动作而泛起的脸颊上的微红，反驳道：“该死，你差点让我把煎锅弄洒了。”

"You're the one that jumped."  
"是你跳下去的。"

Asuka threw a scowl at him before turning back towards the stove.  
明日香瞪了他一眼，然后转身回到炉子前。

Shinji shrugged, got up, and grabbed himself a glass of orange juice out of the fridge.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，站起身，从冰箱里给自己拿了杯橙汁。

After taking a large gulp he said in a low voice, "Any reason why you're making breakfast and not me?"  
他猛地喝了一大口，然后用低沉的声音问道：“有什么理由是你做早餐而不是我吗？”

Asuka seemed to tense up for a second but then regained her composure. "Not particularly, would you rather do it?"  
明日香似乎紧张了一瞬，但随即恢复了镇定。“没什么特别的原因，你更想做吗？”

"No, I just don't see what the point of making two breakfasts is."  
“不，我只是不明白做两份早餐的意义何在。”

Asuka looked over at her shoulder and glared at him. _"Two breakfasts?"_  
明日香回头瞪了他一眼。“两份早餐？”

"Well, yeah. Its not like your making it for both of us."  
“嗯，是啊。又不是你来做给我们俩吃。”

Without turning around Asuka said, "Fine! You won't get any then."  
明日香没有转身，说道：“好吧！那你一份也别想得到。”

It took Shinji several seconds to realize what she ment by this statement. "Wait, what? You mean you had planned on making enough for both of us."  
真嗣花了好几秒才明白她这句话的意思。“等等，什么？你是说你本来就打算做够我们两个人吃的？”

"That was my intention when I woke up this morning but if you don't want to taste my cooking go right ahead and just eat cereal."  
“我今早起床时的确是这么打算的，但如果你不想尝尝我的厨艺，尽管去吃麦片好了。”

An awkward silence was met by this during which Shinji rebuked his hasty words. After a few minutes of silence he said, "Sorry what I said, just didn't expect you to be thinking of me."  
这段话之后是一阵尴尬的沉默，真嗣在心里责备自己说话太急。沉默了几分钟后，他说：“抱歉，我刚才的话，只是没想到你会考虑到我。”

Asuka response was to hit him on the back of the head with a serving spoon. "Ass!"  
明日香回应的方式是用一把勺子敲打他的后脑勺。“笨蛋！”

Shinji rubbed the spot on his head, slightly confused. Was Third Impact close?  
真嗣揉了揉头上的部位，略感困惑。第三次冲击要来了吗？

Letting out a low sigh he rested his head on the table and mumbled. "To tell you the truth I didn't even know you could cook."  
他低声叹了口气，将头靠在桌上喃喃自语。“说实话，我甚至不知道你会做饭。”

"Just because I don't, doesn't mean I can't," she snapped back at him.  
"只是因为我现在不做，不代表我不会做，"她厉声回敬他。

"Sorry I didn't mean-" "对不起，我不是故意的——"

"Just shut it and eat," Asuka said as she dropped a plate with two pancakes on it in front of Shinji.  
"闭嘴吃你的吧，"明日香说着，将一盘装有两块煎饼的盘子放在真嗣面前。

Shinji frowned at the plate and then looked up at Asuka who had her arms crossed and was trying not to look in his direction.  
真嗣对着盘子皱了皱眉，然后抬头看向明日香，她双臂交叉，尽量不朝他的方向看。

"Err, you sure you don't want to eat first."  
“呃，你确定不想先吃吗？”

Asuka raised an eyebrow at him and replied cooly, "Its fine."  
明日香对他挑了挑眉，冷冷地回答：“没事。”

Shrugging Shinji picked up a fork and knife and dug into the first one. It was good, way better than his and he could understand why she had wanted to make it. It was fluffy, but not to the point of it getting to soggy when syrup was applied. It didn't even really need syrup.  
耸了耸肩，真嗣拿起叉子和刀开始吃第一个。味道很好，比他自己做的要好得多，他明白为什么她想做这个了。松软适度，即使加上糖浆也不会变得过于松软。甚至不太需要糖浆。

"This is good, far better that how I make it actually."  
“这个很好吃，比我做的要好多了。”

Asuka tried not to look to pleased with herself.  
明日香尽量不让自己显得太得意。

"Where did you learn to cook like this anyway?"  
"你到底是在哪儿学会做这么好吃的菜的？"

Shrugging Asuka said, "At college. I didn't eat out much. Pancakes is what I usually ate each morning. I sorta made my own recipe."  
明日香耸了耸肩说："在大学里。我不怎么在外面吃。早餐通常都是吃煎饼，我有点自己琢磨出来的食谱。"

"Its good." "真不错。"

"Glad you liked it." "很高兴你喜欢。"

"What about you? Aren't you going to get a plate?"  
"那你呢？不打算拿一盘吗？"

Asuka's face seemed to shift as her features reacted wildly to his question. "Err, no. I already ate."  
明日香的脸色似乎变了变，她的表情对他的问题反应激烈。“呃，不了。我已经吃过了。”

Shinji hesitated for a fraction of a second and that was all Asuka needed to make an excuse. "Don't get any ideas! I didn't make it for you, I just hadn't made it in a while and felt like it was good practice."  
真嗣犹豫了片刻，而这正是明日香所需要的借口。“别多想！我不是为你做的，只是很久没做了，觉得这是个不错的练习机会。”

"U-huh." “嗯-嗯。”

Asuka's face turned slightly pink as she turned around, "Baka!"  
明日香转过身去，脸上微微泛红，“笨蛋！”

Shinji just laughed and dug into another piece. He found it funny that she didn't want to admit that she had made it specifically for him. Though whether she was proving that hers tasted better or just felt like giving him the day off he wasn't sure. Though he seemed to lean a little to the latter.  
真嗣只是笑了笑，又挖了一块吃。他觉得她不愿承认这是专门为他做的挺有趣。虽然她是在证明自己的味道更好，还是只是想让他休息一天，他不太确定。不过他似乎更倾向于后者。

"And hurry it up will you, we're gonna be late for school."  
“快点儿，我们要迟到了。”

"Hai, hai." “嗨，嗨。”

Asuka then busied herself with cleaning up the mess that she had left...which was quite a lot.  
随后，明日香忙于清理她留下的烂摊子……那可真不少。

After devouring four pancakes Shinji called himself satisfied and quickly entered his room and started to dress. After pulling on his shirt and fastening the buttons he thought he heard the phone ringing and Asuka's annoyed voice answering it. Grabbing some socks off his floor he hopped out on one foot, putting them on as he went.  
吃完四块煎饼后，真嗣自认为心满意足，迅速回到房间开始更衣。穿上衬衫并扣好扣子后，他似乎听到电话铃声和明日香不耐烦的应答声。他从地上抓起几双袜子，单脚跳着，边走边穿。

His first guess that something was wrong when he saw Asuka frowning slightly as she talked into the receiver of the phone. After a hasty hang up Asuka turned to him and said, "Misato wants us to come to Nerv right now."  
当他看到明日香微微皱眉对着电话听筒说话时，他首先猜测出了问题。匆匆挂断电话后，明日香转向他，说道：“美里让我们现在就去 NERV。”

Still hopping on one foot Shinji replied, "Angel attack?"  
仍然单脚跳着的真嗣回答道：“使徒来袭？”

Asuka nodded silently and for once Shinji wished that he was going to school.  
明日香默默地点了点头，这一次，真嗣真希望自己能去上学。

Sighing he said, "Best get moving then."  
他叹了口气说：“那最好赶紧动身。”

Asuka nodded and followed him out the door.  
明日香点点头，跟着他走出门外。

---

As soon as Asuka and Shinji entered Nerv headquarters they were directed to the command center. Misato then filled them in on an angel that they had detected of the coast of Tokyo-3. Not much was known about this angel and they were supposed to be extremely cautious. Rei would not be taking part in the operation though owing to the fact that Unit-00 was still damaged from the last battle. Asuka was therefore determined to show Shinji that she was the better of the three children. Before they were sent up to the surface though Misato gave them some advice.  
明日香和真嗣一进入 NERV 总部，就被引导到指挥中心。美里随后向他们通报了在东京-3 海岸附近探测到的一个使徒。关于这个使徒的信息并不多，他们被告知要极其谨慎。由于零号机在上次战斗中受损，绫波不会参与此次行动。因此，明日香决心向真嗣展示她在这三个孩子中是最优秀的。在他们被派往地表之前，美里给了他们一些建议。

"Now this is technically your first time teaming up together so I want you two to get along, and by this I mean not arguing and working together.  
“现在这实际上是你们第一次合作，所以我希望你们俩能和睦相处，我的意思是不要争吵，要协同工作。”

"It'll be fine as long as Shinji just listens to me. I am the better pilot after all," said Asuka while shrugging. Misato hadn't told her about his performance in the last battle, or the fact that he had almost beaten her best sync rate.  
"只要真嗣听我的，一切都会顺利的。毕竟我才是更优秀的驾驶员。" 明日香耸耸肩说道。美里并没有告诉她真嗣在上一场战斗中的表现，以及他几乎打破了她最佳同步率的事实。

Turning around, Asuka smiled at Shinji and said, "Got that baka."  
转过身，明日香对真嗣微笑着说："明白了吗，笨蛋。"

Shinji sighed and replied, "Yeah."  
真嗣叹了口气，回答道："嗯。"

Misato was nervous for the results of this battle.  
美里对这场战斗的结果感到紧张。

After the two entered their respected Eva's Misato's voice came over the intercom. "Asuka enter elevator number three, Shinji number two. Rifles will be awaiting you at the surface."  
两人进入各自的 Eva 后，美里的声音通过对讲机传来。“明日香进入三号电梯，真嗣进二号。地面上有步枪等着你们。”

Shinji sighed and felt a familiar sense of being shot through a cannon as he rocketed to the surface.  
真嗣叹了口气，感觉自己像被大炮轰出去一样，飞速冲向地面。

As the gate for the elevator opened Unit 01 quickly grabbed a rifle and ducked down behind a building. Shinji saw that Asuka had done similar and was several blocks to the left of his position.  
电梯门一开，初号机迅速抓起一支步枪，躲到一栋建筑后面。真嗣看到明日香也采取了类似行动，位于他左侧几个街区之外。

"Pattern blue detected entering Tokyo-3 defense zone," came a voice over the intercom. "Retracting Tokyo-3 now."  
“蓝色模式检测到进入东京-3 防御区域，”对讲机里传来一个声音，“现在开始撤回东京-3。”

It still amazed Shinji every time he saw it. The buildings, almost retreating into the safety of the Geofront. He suddenly wondered what it would look like if the sun was setting as it happened. Shaking his head quickly he emptied his thoughts and looked to his left to see Unit 02 crouching, waiting for the go ahead.  
每次看到这一幕，真嗣仍然感到惊叹。那些建筑，几乎退回到地表之下的安全地带。他突然好奇，如果此时夕阳西下，这一幕会是什么样子。他迅速摇了摇头，清空思绪，向左看去，只见零号机蹲伏着，等待指令。

After several tense minutes Shinji felt the silence of everyone around him and heard Misato over the intercom. "Lockdown of Tokyo-3 confirmed, proceed with the operation."  
经过几分钟的紧张气氛，真嗣感觉到周围的寂静，并听到美里通过对讲机传来指令：“第三新东京市的封锁已确认，继续执行任务。”

Almost as soon as Misato cut the radio Shinji saw a screen open on the monitor to his left and frowned when he saw Asuka smirking at him.  
美里刚切断通讯，真嗣几乎立刻看到左侧监视器上打开了一个屏幕，当他看到明日香对他得意地笑时，不禁皱起了眉头。

"Just stay back and let me handle this. I'll show you why I'm the best pilot here."  
“你就待在后面，让我来处理。我会让你明白为什么我是这里最棒的驾驶员。”

"Wait, don't you think its better if we both attack it."  
"等等，你不觉得我们俩一起攻击会更好吗？"

His words were apparently ignored as Asuka dove out from behind her hiding spot and rushed towards the waterfront.  
显然，他的话被忽视了，因为明日香从她的藏身之处冲了出来，直奔水边。

Shinji but his lip and swore, "Damn it, can't she ever listen to anything I say."  
真嗣咬了咬嘴唇，发誓道：“该死，她怎么从来不听我说的话。”

Taking off after her he thought anyway, 'Whether she wants help or not I'm giving it to her.'  
他追上去时心想，'不管她是否需要帮助，我都要给她。'

Shinji was quick to catch up with Asuka and she was visibly surprised by it. Smiling slightly she thought, 'Oh? Seems that he's improved a little bit.'  
真嗣很快追上了明日香，她明显感到惊讶。她微微一笑，心想，'哦？看来他进步了一点。'

Soon both of them could see the angel walking slowly out of the water and onto the beach.  
很快，两人都能看到使徒缓缓从水中走出，踏上沙滩。

"Shinji watch this, I'm going to kill it in one shot."  
"真嗣，看好了，我一枪就能解决它。"

"Asuka wait! We shouldn't charge in without knowing what its powers are!"  
"明日香，等等！我们不应该在不了解它的能力的情况下贸然进攻！"

Unit 02 dashed towards he angel, creating a deep groove in the sand. Though the angel seemed to be slow, with its bulky arms and legs it swung quickly as Unit 02 got into range. Asuka rolled around the angel quite easily as she dodged its arms.  
2 号机朝着天使疾驰而去，在沙地上划出一道深痕。尽管天使看似动作迟缓，笨重的四肢却在 2 号机进入攻击范围时迅速挥动。明日香轻松地绕着天使翻滚，躲避着它的手臂。

Now behind her target she quickly pulled out her progressive knife and stabbed it straight in the back. A small fountain of black blood erupted out of it and with a quick slash downwards Asuka managed to split it in two.  
现在她已经绕到了目标身后，迅速拔出她的渐进式刀，直刺入背部。一股黑色的血液喷涌而出，阿斯卡迅速向下划去，成功将其一分为二。

Black blood spilled forth as it fell in two separate heaps, landing with a thud on the sand. Soon the sand had turned black from the blood and parts of Unit 02 were coated in the blood. Shinji had to turn away as he saw several large organs fall out of the angel and writhe around on the sand before falling silent. He was inadvertently remembering his past battle and the taste of the flesh that had gone through his mouth.  
黑色的血液四溅，它分成两堆倒下，重重地落在沙地上。很快，沙地被血液染黑，二号机的部分也被血液覆盖。真嗣不得不转过头去，因为他看到几个巨大的器官从使徒体内掉出，在沙地上扭动，最后静止不动。他无意中回忆起自己过去的战斗和那穿过嘴里的肉的味道。

"See, one shot was all it took. I am the best though so its not to be unexpected."  
“看，一击就够了。我是最棒的，所以这并不意外。”

Shinji couldn't help but smile, he was fairly impressed. Relaxing slightly he felt a slight tingle on the back of his neck and felt a familiar voice whisper, "Its _not over yet_."  
真嗣忍不住笑了，他相当佩服。稍微放松了一些，他感到后颈一阵轻微的刺痛，一个熟悉的声音低语道：“还没结束呢。”

Next second Shinji heard an ear splitting racket over the intercom from Misato.  
下一秒，真嗣从通讯器里听到了美里震耳欲聋的喊声。

"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING. DESTROY THE DAMN CORE BEFORE IT REGENERATES!"  
“你到底在搞什么鬼！在它再生之前毁掉那个该死的核心！”

Shinji looked wildly back at the angel and saw something truly horrifying. The angel was slowly starting to rebuild itself. Pieces of flesh started to mold together and reform on the sand. Organs exploded and reformed into two different organs, leaving many different colored liquids in the sand. Shinji thought what he recognized as the stomach deflate and then tear itself into. Stomach acid was formed in the walls of the stomach and slowly started to fill back up. Shinji had a strong urge to bring his breakfast back up but held it. The large and small intestines split themselves apart and then reformed again. It was like high speed cell regeneration.  
真嗣狂乱地回头看向使徒，目睹了一幕真正骇人的景象。使徒正缓慢地自我修复。肉块开始在沙地上融合重组，器官爆炸后又重新形成两个不同的器官，留下各种颜色的液体在沙地上。真嗣认出那像是胃的器官先是萎缩，然后撕裂开来。胃酸在胃壁中形成，并慢慢重新充满。真嗣强烈地想要把早餐吐出来，但还是忍住了。大肠和小肠自行分裂，然后再次重组。这就像是高速的细胞再生。

Soon the two different flesh piles fixated itself onto each of the different halves of the angel. Not even a scar could be visible as the angel, now two separate halves, picked itself off the ground.  
很快，两堆不同的肉块各自固定在使徒的两个半边上。使徒现在分成两半，从地上站起，连一道疤痕都看不见。

Asuka seemed to not have noticed as she had her back to the angel now and was just wondering why Misato seemed so worried when she felt something hit her Eva in the back. She was sent flying forward and collided directly into Unit 01.  
明日香似乎没有注意到，她背对着使徒，只是好奇为什么美里看起来如此担忧，这时她感觉到有什么东西击中了她的 EVA 背部。她被猛地向前抛出，直接撞上了 01 号机。

"Damn it Asuka, get off me."  
"该死的明日香，从我身上下来。"

"Its your fault for standing there."  
"谁让你站在那儿的。"

"Its your fault for attacking so recklessly."  
"谁让你攻击得这么鲁莽。"

Asuka bit her lip and ignored his comment. How the hell was she supposed to know that this was going to happen.  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇，对他的话置之不理。她怎么可能预料到会发生这种事。

"Anyway, just pick one and attack it."  
“总之，随便选一个攻击就行了。”

Shinji was about to agree with her when he heard Misato's angry voice come on the intercom again.  
真嗣正要同意她的意见，却听到美里愤怒的声音再次通过对讲机传来。

"Forget it. I'm disengaging this operation."  
"算了吧。我退出这次行动。"

"HUH," cried a shocked Asuka.  
"什么！" 明日香震惊地喊道。

"If you guys can't work together then you won't be able to beat this angel."  
"如果你们不能合作，就无法打败这个使徒。"

"Watch me!" Yelled Asuka.  
"看我的！" 明日香大喊道。

Asuka charged forward again, about to attack the one closest to her when she felt something akin to whiplash. Shinji had just barely managed to grab her Eva around the waist and pull her backwards. She had been so focused on attacking the one in front of her that she had completely ignored the other one which had been close to taking off Unit 02's right arm.  
明日香再次冲锋，正要攻击离她最近的那一个时，她感到一阵类似鞭打的冲击。真嗣刚刚勉强抓住了她的 Eva 腰部，将她向后拉。她太专注于攻击前面的那个，以至于完全忽略了另一个，后者差点就卸掉了 02 号的右臂。

"What the hell are you doing ass hole!"  
"你他妈的在搞什么鬼，混蛋！"

"Saving you damn it. You completely ignored the other one!"  
"救你个鬼啊。你完全忽略了另一个！"

"I expected you to cover me baka."  
"我以为你会掩护我的，笨蛋。"

"ENOUGH!" Yelled Misato. "Return now! Both of you."  
"够了！" 美里喊道。"现在就回来！你们两个。"

Asuka grimaced, "Damn it..."  
明日香皱了皱眉，"该死..."

Shinji wasn't to pleased either but was eyeing the angel. Oddly enough it didn't seem like it was interested in them, in fact the two separate halves reformed and went back in the ocean. Shinji dropped his guard then, and still realized that he had a hand on Asuka's Eva's shoulder.  
真嗣也不太高兴，但他正盯着那只使徒。奇怪的是，它似乎对他们并不感兴趣，实际上，那两个分离的部分重新组合，回到了海中。真嗣放下了戒备，这才意识到自己的手还搭在明日香的 EVA 肩上。

"Come on...lets head back, Asuka."  
“走吧...我们回去吧，明日香。”

"Fucking..." Letting out a sigh she said, "Fine."  
"该死的..." 她叹了口气，说道，"好吧。"

---

What followed after was, in Misato's words, "A debriefing," though Shinji thought it was more like a berating. He didn't know how many times she had called it an operational failure. What was possibly worse was the shouting match that happened between himself and Asuka. No matter what Shinji had actually done, Asuka found someway to blame the entire thing on himself. After a hasty lunch, which consisted of nothing more than T.V. dinners, Asuka and Shinji had confined themselves in there separate places. Asuka in front of the T.V. and Shinji in his room.  
接下来发生的事情，用美里的话来说，是"一次汇报"，但在真嗣看来，更像是一场责骂。他不知道她已经多少次称之为操作失误了。更糟糕的是，他和明日香之间爆发的争吵。无论真嗣实际上做了什么，明日香总能找到某种方式把整件事归咎于他。匆匆吃完一顿仅由电视快餐组成的午餐后，明日香和真嗣各自躲到了不同的地方。明日香坐在电视机前，而真嗣则回到了自己的房间。

After close to an hour of just laying there and listening to his SDAT, Shinji thought he heard the opening and slamming of the front door. Knowing that Misato would likely chew him out sooner or later he decided to get it over with sooner.  
躺了近一个小时，听着他的 SDAT，真嗣觉得自己听到了前门打开又猛然关上的声音。知道美里迟早会训斥他，他决定早点面对。

Opening his door quietly he poked his head out to see Misato's retreating back heading towards the kitchen. Misato must have heard him though because she paused for a second and said, "Shinji, I need to talk to you and Asuka."  
轻轻地打开门，他探出头去，看到美里正朝厨房走去的背影。美里似乎听到了动静，因为她停顿了一下，说道：“真嗣，我需要和你还有明日香谈谈。”

Knowing that her name would be brought up eventually, Shinji caught a brief glimpse of Asuka's face as she plodded out of the living room, being sure to give him a grimace.  
知道她的名字迟早会被提及，真嗣瞥见了明日香从客厅拖着脚步走出来的脸，她肯定给了他一个苦笑。

Sighing heavily, Shinji followed her at a distance and was unsurprised to see Misato sitting at the table with a beer already in her hand.  
重重地叹了口气，真嗣保持距离地跟在她后面，看到美里已经坐在桌前手里拿着一罐啤酒，他并不感到意外。

"Sit," she gestured to the two.  
“坐下，”她示意两人。

As soon as they had sat, Misato popped the top off the can and drank a heavy gulp. Shinji was a bit disgusted at her actions, it was only noon for Christ's sake.  
他们刚一坐下，美里就打开罐子猛灌一口。真嗣对她这行为有点反感，毕竟这才中午呢。

After taking another large gulp Misato slammed the can down on the table, folder her arms on the table, and frowned at the two. "That was some of the worst team work I've ever seen."  
又猛喝一大口后，美里将罐子重重地放在桌上，双臂交叉在桌上，皱着眉头看向两人。“那是我见过的最糟糕的团队合作。”

"Well, sorry if somebody wasn't able to keep up with me-"  
"好吧，如果有人跟不上我，我道歉——"

Shinji threw a glare in Asuka's direction and another shouting match would have followed if Misato hadn't held out her hand to shut them up.  
真嗣朝明日香的方向瞪了一眼，如果不是美里伸出一只手让他们闭嘴，一场争吵又要爆发了。

"I don't care who slowed who down. If you two won't work together you won't be able to defeat this angel." Pausing for a moment Misato continued. "This angel is able to split itself in two, though they are still part of the same angel. Because of this, they are perfectly synchronized with each other, meaning that they are able to read each other thought patterns."  
"我不在乎是谁拖了谁的后腿。如果你们两个不能合作，就无法打败这个使徒。" 美里停顿了一下继续说道。"这个使徒能够分裂成两个，尽管它们仍然是同一个使徒的一部分。正因为如此，它们之间完全同步，意味着它们能够读取对方的思维模式。"

Shinji frowned, "Humans can't read others thoughts."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，"人类无法读取他人的思想。"

Misato nodded, "While true, humans are able to sync with each other in other ways. One such form is dance and music."  
美里点头道，"虽然如此，人类还是能通过其他方式与彼此同步。比如舞蹈和音乐就是其中一种形式。"

It took Shinji slightly longer than Asuka to figure out what she ment.  
真嗣比明日香稍慢一些才领会到她的意思。

"THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?"  
"这他妈是什么意思？"

Shinji turned to see a bright angry Asuka glaring dumbfounded back at Misato.  
真嗣转头看到一个愤怒而困惑的明日香，正茫然地瞪着美里。

Sighing, Misato replied, "Its exactly I ment it to sound like. In order to beat this angel you two need to work together. The only way to do that in a short amount of time is to be able to fluently synchronization each others bodies to the motions of the other.  
"美里叹了口气，回答道：“我就是那个意思。为了打败这个使徒，你们俩需要合作。短时间内做到这一点的唯一方法就是能够流畅地同步彼此的身体动作。”

"Wh-What do you mean by synchronization of each other bodies."  
"同-同步彼此的身体是什么意思？"

Taking another large gulp of beer from the can, Misato slammed it back down and with a slight grin on her face shouted, "DANCE!"  
米莎又猛灌了一大口啤酒，然后将罐子重重地放回桌上，脸上带着一丝笑意大喊道：“跳舞吧！”

Shinji almost fell out of his chair...while Asuka did fall out of hers.  
真嗣差点从椅子上摔下来...而明日香则真的摔了下去。

"DANCE WITH THIS IDIOT, YOU MUST BE FUCKING CRAZY!"  
"和这个白痴跳舞，你一定是疯了！"

"Whether this seems crazy or not doesn't matter. It should theoretically work-"  
"这看起来是否疯狂并不重要。理论上它应该能行——"

"AND IF IT DOESN'T?" "如果不行呢？"

Shrugging Misato said, "We'll think of something else. But for now, this is the best we've got."  
耸了耸肩，美里说：“我们会想别的办法。但眼下，这是我们最好的选择了。”

"Damn it, why can't you just get the first to do this? I'd rather let her degraded herself instead of me."  
“该死，为什么你不能让初号机来做这个？我宁愿让她自降身份，也不想自己来。”

With her mouth half way up to the can Misato replied, "I would have used her instead but Unit 00 won't be fully repaired for another two days and we don't have that time." Slamming the can down on the table she said, "You two will from now on do everything together. You will dance together, eat together, sleep in the same room together, you will practically take a shower together."  
美里一边把嘴凑近罐子一边回答：“我本想用她，但零号机还要两天才能完全修好，我们没那个时间。”她猛地把罐子摔在桌上，说：“你们俩从现在开始要一起做所有事。一起跳舞，一起吃饭，一起睡在同一个房间，几乎要一起洗澡。”

"THE FUC-"

"Calm down Asuka, its just a figure of speech," said Shinji.  
"冷静点，Asuka，这只是个比喻，" 真嗣说道。

"You'd like that pervert."  
"你倒是挺喜欢那个变态的。"

Shinji was about to open his mouth when Misato cut in like a knife.  
真嗣正要开口，美里却像刀子一样插了进来。

"Enough! And while this is going on I don't want you two arguing with each other. That will completely undermine this project.  
“够了！而且在这期间我不希望你们两个互相争吵。那会彻底破坏这个项目的。”

"When exactly are we supposed to start?"  
“我们到底什么时候开始？”

"Now. Later I'll have you move your futons into the living room but for now I want you to go to school, even though it is late in the day."  
"现在。晚些时候我会让你把被褥搬到客厅，但现在我要求你去上学，尽管时间已经不早了。"

"Fine!" Asuka stood to get up but Misato spoke up quickly. "I've got something that I want you two to wear to school."  
"好吧！" 明日香站起来准备离开，但美里迅速开口。"我有些东西想让你们俩穿去学校。"

Holding up an oddly wrapped package Shinji was able to see some of what was inside and felt his stomach drop.  
举着一个包装奇特的包裹，真嗣瞥见了里面的部分内容，感到胃里一阵翻腾。

"NO WAY IN HELL AM I WEARING THAT," roared Asuka.  
“打死我也不穿那个！”明日香咆哮道。

"You will, because its also important to feel what the other feels, not just physically but emotionally as well, and I think you'll get plenty of emotion out of wearing those to school."  
“你会穿的，因为感受他人的感受不仅在身体上，情感上同样重要，而我认为穿上那些去学校会让你收获满满的情感体验。”

Shinji tried not to imagine them walking into class in the middle of the day, it looked painful. Kensuke and Touji would give him hell.  
真嗣尽量不去想象他们中午走进教室的情景，那看起来很痛苦。剑介和东治肯定会把他骂个狗血淋头。

---

Shinji's predication wasn't even close to the truth. Everyone's reaction were way worse then he had expected. When they had both walked in with the tight, black leather, dancing pants, and matching tank-tops the class was silent for an eternity. Then when they finally started laughing it sounded like a tornado. Kensuke started clicking his camera like mad and Touji fell out of his chair and started banging his fist on the floor. Hikari, a girl that Shinji hardly talked to but had seen talking to Asuka before, blushed an embarrassing deep red and tried to act like she had never seen Asuka before. Even the teacher gave up his feeble attempts to control to class and started snickering wildly and the two. Shinji thought that he even saw Rei crack a brief smile, though brief.
真嗣的预测与事实相去甚远。大家的反应比他预想的要糟糕得多。当他们俩穿着紧身黑色皮裤和配套的背心走进教室时，整个班级陷入了永恒的沉默。随后，当他们终于开始大笑时，那声音如同龙卷风一般。剑介疯狂地按着相机快门，而斗志则从椅子上摔了下来，开始用拳头猛敲地板。与真嗣几乎没说过话但见过与明日香交谈的女生光，脸红得令人尴尬，试图装作从未见过明日香。甚至连老师也放弃了控制班级的无力尝试，开始狂笑不止，看着两人。真嗣甚至觉得他瞥见了丽露出了短暂的微笑，尽管很短暂。

Without looking at each other Shinji and Asuka walked wordlessly to their seats while ignoring the cat-calls and jeering from there fellow students. When Shinji finally sat down he got a brief glimpse of Asuka's face as she sat down. She looked like an over ripe strawberry.  
真嗣和明日香没有互相对视，默默地走向自己的座位，无视了同学们的口哨声和嘲笑。当真嗣终于坐下时，他瞥见了明日香坐下时的脸。她看起来像一颗熟透的草莓。

Though they had arrived at school, lunch was just a few minutes away and Asuka and Shinji had no desire to socialize with other people. Shinji rarely did in the first place, but Asuka didn't feel like it either, so she joined him on the roof of the school for the first time in a while.  
尽管已经到了学校，午餐时间也不过几分钟之后，但明日香和真嗣都不想与其他人社交。真嗣本来就很少这么做，而明日香今天也没这个心情，于是她久违地和他一起去了学校的天台。

"Damn it Misato, I'm gonna give her hell tonight," said an irksome Asuka. Shinji had learned not to bother her when she was like this but didn't care that much today.  
“该死的美里，今晚我要让她好看，”明日香烦躁地说道。真嗣已经学会在她这种状态时不去打扰她，但今天他并不太在意。

"I suppose we can understand what she ment by sharing each others emotions. I don't think I've ever been more embarrassed in my life."  
“我想我们能理解她所说的共享彼此情感的意思了。我觉得我这辈子都没这么尴尬过。”

Asuka then vented some anger off by pretending that half her bento was Misato's face, though she quickly stopped when she realized how hungry she was. Honestly she hadn't eaten earlier, she had just lied to Shinji so he wouldn't feel bad.  
明日香随后通过假装便当的一半是美里脸的方式发泄了一些怒气，但很快她就因为意识到自己有多饿而停止了。老实说，她之前并没有吃东西，只是对真嗣撒了谎，以免他感到难过。

"How the hell is this supposed to help us beat that damn angel."  
“这他妈的怎么帮我们打败那个该死的天使？”

"Beats me." “我也不知道。”

"If it wasn't for you we wouldn't even be in this situation."  
"如果不是因为你，我们根本不会陷入这种境地。"

Shinji had learned long ago that it was pointless trying to convince her otherwise so he just ignored it. Though there peace was short lived as the door to the stairway came banging open.  
真嗣早就明白试图说服她是没有意义的，所以他只是置之不理。然而，他们的平静并未持续多久，楼梯间的门就被猛地撞开了。

"See told you they'd be here," said a laughing Touji as he walked through the door.  
"看吧，我就说他们在这儿，" 笑着走进门的冬二说道。"

"I suppose it seems logical since this is where Shinji spends his lunch, and I'm not surprised to see Asuka here either," said Kensuke.  
"“我想这很合理，毕竟这里是真嗣吃午饭的地方，看到明日香在这里我也不意外，”健介说道。”

Asuka stood up then and twitched slightly. Shinji could feel the anger that was coursing off of her and knew she'd like nothing better than to unleash her frustration on them. Standing up quickly before she decided to kill them, he put a hand out in front of her and said, "Best not to."  
"明日香随即站起身，微微抽搐了一下。真嗣能感受到她身上散发出的怒气，知道她恨不得将满腔的愤怒发泄在他们身上。他迅速站起来，抢在她决定动手之前挡在她面前，伸出手说：“最好别这样。””

Asuka turned her head towards him and glared at him before sitting down, "Whatever."  
"明日香转头瞪了他一眼，然后坐下，“随你便。””

Touji and Kensuke were obviously prepared to run but calmed down when Asuka sat back down. Kensuke slowly started walking over to Shinji then but still keeping an eye on Asuka, though she seemed to be preoccupied.  
冬二和剑介显然准备逃跑，但当明日香重新坐下后，他们也平静了下来。剑介慢慢地走向真嗣，但仍不时瞥向明日香，尽管她似乎心不在焉。

"So Shinji...are you gonna tell us why you two look like that?"  
“那么，真嗣……你打算告诉我们为什么你们俩看起来那样吗？”

Shinji had expected more ridicule instead of questioning. Glancing over at Asuka, the two came into eye contact and Asuka shrugged as if saying, "I couldn't give a flying fuck."  
真嗣本以为会遭到更多嘲讽，而不是询问。他瞥了一眼明日香，两人目光相接，明日香耸了耸肩，仿佛在说：“我他妈才不在乎。”

Shinji sighed then, deciding that he didn't care remotely either and delved into the long winded story of the Eva's and the battles with the angels.  
真嗣叹了口气，决定自己也不在乎这些细节，于是深入讲述起了 EVA 和与使徒战斗的长篇故事。

After a severely cut down version of events Shinji came to the part with the last battle and surprisingly Asuka picked up the story telling them how degrading it was to have to learn how to dance with Shinji. Touji then decided to make a remark which almost ended up with him knocked out with a pool of blood around him. Though Shinji had intervened at the last moment.  
在事件被大幅简化后，真嗣讲到了最后一场战斗，出乎意料的是，明日香接过了故事，告诉他们学习与真嗣共舞是多么丢脸的事。这时，冬二决定插句话，结果差点被揍得满地找牙，幸好真嗣在最后一刻阻止了他。

"Wow, so thats why you left school suddenly sometimes?"  
“哇，所以这就是你有时突然离开学校的原因吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"But wait Shinji how long have you been doing this."  
"但是等等，真嗣，你做这个多久了？"

"You remember when we were searching for a shelter together that time."  
"你还记得那次我们一起寻找避难所的时候吗？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"After that time is when I decided that I'd pilot Eva."  
"那次之后，我就决定要驾驶 EVA 了。"

"Wow." "哇。"

"I don't see why your so impressed. I hate being inside of those things."  
"我不明白你为什么这么印象深刻。我讨厌待在那些东西里面。"

"So wait what were you telling me about the entry plu-"  
"等等，你刚才跟我说的是关于入口的什么来着-"

Kensuke was cut off from his rant then as the bell rang.  
随着铃声响起，健介的抱怨被打断了。

"Ah and I still had lots more questions."  
“啊，我还有很多问题没问完呢。”

"I'll you them later." “我晚点再告诉你。”

"Okay see you in class."  
"好的，课上见。"

"Yeah cya." "嗯，再见。"

Shinji and Asuka were then left alone briefly. Shinji rested his back against the chain fence before standing up. Turning towards Asuka who was still sitting he held out a hand to help her up. Asuka blinked at his gesture and seemed to look around as though expecting a crowd of people watching them. Accepting his gesture she rested her hand in his and he gently pulled her to her feet.  
随后，真嗣和明日香短暂地独处了。真嗣背靠铁丝网休息了一会儿，然后站起身来。他转向仍然坐着的明日香，伸出手帮助她起身。明日香对他的举动眨了眨眼，似乎在环顾四周，好像期待有一群人在围观他们。她接受了他的好意，将手放在他的手上，他轻轻地将她拉了起来。

Motioning towards the door Shinji said, "Come on, lets head back to class."  
示意门口，真嗣说道，“来吧，我们回教室去。”

Shinji took about half a step forward, expecting Asuka's hand to slide out of his, though it didn't. In fact she seemed to hold on tighter. Turning towards her he asked, "Asuka wha-"  
真嗣向前迈了大约半步，以为明日香的手会从他的手中滑出，但并没有。实际上，她似乎握得更紧了。他转向她问道，“明日香，怎-”

"I don't want to go back..."  
“我不想回去……”

"What?" "什么？"

"I said I don't want to go back to class. Lets...lets just go home."  
"我说了我不想回教室。我们...我们直接回家吧。"

Shinji paused for a second and thought about several things. Was she really that embarrassed about what she was wearing? It wasn't that bad once you got over the initial shock.  
真嗣停顿了一下，思考了几件事。她真的对她的穿着感到那么尴尬吗？一旦你克服了最初的震惊，其实也没那么糟糕。

Scratching his head he said, "I guess there's really no reason in staying here anymore. I think we got the emotional part down. We certainly were laughed at enough."  
他挠了挠头说：“我想我们真的没有理由再待在这里了。我觉得我们已经充分表达了情感。我们确实被嘲笑得够多了。”

"Yeah, no kidding," mumbled Asuka.  
“是啊，还用你说，”明日香咕哝道。

Asuka then let go of his hand quickly after he had agreed on heading home and walked next to him as they left the roof.  
在碇真嗣同意回家后，明日香迅速松开了他的手，与他并肩离开了屋顶。

---

Misato was unsurprisingly not back from work; still probably cleaning up the aftermath of their last battle, Shinji reminded himself.  
美里果然还没下班；真嗣提醒自己，她可能还在清理他们上次战斗的残局。

Predictably Asuka flopped down on the couch and flipped on the T.V. as soon as they got home. Shinji meanwhile entered the kitchen and was about to get a glass of water when he noticed something on the kitchen table. It was a note from Misato.  
不出所料，他们一回到家，明日香就扑通一声倒在沙发上，打开了电视。与此同时，真嗣走进厨房，正准备倒杯水时，注意到餐桌上有张纸条。那是美里留下的。

Hesitantly picking it up he had a sudden mental imagine of it starting to yell at him. Shrugging it off he walked over to the living room and had to clear his throat loudly since Asuka had raised the volume on the T.V. to maximum  
他犹豫地拿起纸条，脑海中突然浮现出它开始对他大吼的画面。他耸耸肩，走到客厅，不得不大声清了清喉咙，因为明日香已经把电视音量调到了最大。

"What baka?" Asuka asked when she muted the T.V. and turned to face Shinji.  
“什么笨蛋？”明日香关掉电视，转过身来面对真嗣，问道。

"Misato left us something."  
"美里留下了些东西。"

Asuka's eyebrows twitch angrily. She had almost torn off her dance pants and tank-top half way to Misato's apartment and it was only from Shinji convincing her otherwise that she didn't. So anything about Misato was sure to piss her off.  
明日香的眉毛愤怒地抽动了一下。她几乎在前往美里公寓的路上就撕掉了自己的舞蹈裤和背心，要不是真嗣劝阻，她早就这么做了。所以任何关于美里的事情都肯定会惹她生气。

"Whatever read it." "不管是什么，读出来吧。"

"Err okay..." “呃，好吧...”

"_Asuka, Shinji, sorry about earlier. I was a little stressed out from the battle. Anyway I left something on the counter for you two. Its the music that goes along with the dance that you'll be memorizing for the battle. The dance simulation wont be here till tomorrow though so I want you to spend a few hours just listening to the music. Most likely I wont return home tonight so Shinji don't worry about cooking extra. Can't wait to hear how school went."_  
“明日香，真嗣，抱歉刚才的事。战斗让我有点紧张。对了，我在柜台上给你们留了点东西。是你们将要记住的战斗舞蹈的配乐。不过舞蹈模拟器要到明天才能到，所以我想让你们先花几个小时听音乐。今晚我大概不会回家了，所以真嗣不用担心多做饭。等不及听你们讲学校的事了。”

_-Misato -美里_

Shinji stared at the note for a few minutes and then folded it up and put it in his pocket.  
真嗣盯着那张纸条看了几分钟，然后把它折起来放进了口袋。

"So what is it that she left us?" Asked Asuka.  
“她给我们留了什么？”明日香问道。

Shrugging Shinji walked back over to the kitchen counter while Asuka stuck her head into the hallway and watched him. What he had missed on the counter was a white envelope that seemed to barely be holding in its contents. Sliding his finger along the seem the turned it upside down and out fell an old cassette player with ear buds. A note was attached to the cassette player.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，走回厨房的柜台旁，而明日香则探头望向走廊，注视着他。他之前没注意到的是，柜台上有一个白色的信封，似乎勉强包裹着里面的东西。他用手指沿着封口划开，将信封倒置，一个旧的随身听连同耳机掉了出来。随身听上还附着一张纸条。

"_This cassette only has one song on it so just repeat it over and over. Also I know that you have your own ear buds Shinji but I want you to use these. And don't even try changing the length of it."_  
"这盒磁带只有一首歌，所以就一遍遍重复播放。还有，我知道你有自己的耳机，真嗣，但我要你用这些。别想着调整它们的长度。"

Shinji wondered what she ment by the length of the ear buds but was interrupted by someone hovering over his shoulder.  
真嗣疑惑她说的耳机长度是什么意思，但被一个俯身在他肩上的人打断了。

"That thing looks ancient."  
"那东西看起来很古老。"

Shinji turned towards Asuka and rather wished he hadn't as their noses almost touched. Passing it off he said, "Yeah, its a lot older than the one I have."  
真嗣转向明日香，几乎要后悔这个动作了，因为他们的鼻子差点碰上。他若无其事地说：“嗯，它比我手上的那个要古老得多。”

"What? You think its her father's or something."  
“什么？你觉得这是她父亲的或者什么的。”

"Maybe...should we try it?"  
“也许……我们要不要试试？”

Asuka let out a heavy sigh and smacked herself lightly on the forehead. "Might as well get this damn thing over with."  
明日香重重地叹了口气，轻轻拍了拍自己的额头。“干脆把这该死的东西解决掉算了。”

Shinji nodded and unrolled the ear buds and passed the cassette player to Asuka. Together, the two of them walked back to the living room and sat down on the couch. After turning off the T.V. the two frowned at the cassette player now resting between them.  
真嗣点点头，展开了耳机，将随身听递给明日香。两人一起走回客厅，坐在沙发上。关掉电视后，他们皱着眉头看着现在放在他们之间的随身听。

"Well, get it on with it," said Asuka with a grimace.  
“好吧，开始吧，”明日香皱着眉头说。

Shinji nodded and grabbed his ear bud piece and stuck it in his left ear while Asuka had hers in her right ear. Shinji then realized why Misato had told them not to try to resize the ear buds. The length between the two was so minuscule that their heads were banging into each other.  
真嗣点点头，拿起他的耳塞放入左耳，而明日香则将她的放入右耳。随后，真嗣明白了美里为什么告诉他们不要试图调整耳塞的大小。两人之间的距离如此之小，以至于他们的头不停地撞在一起。

"Move over damn it!" “滚开，该死的！”

"Thats not gonna work. The ear buds are what's causing this."  
“那样没用。是耳塞的问题。”

"Then making them longer."  
"然后让它们更长一些。"

Shinji pulled his out of his ear and frowned down at it. It was already at its longest.  
真嗣从耳朵里取出耳机，皱着眉头看着它。它已经是最长的状态了。

"This is as long as it gets."  
"这已经是最长的了。"

Asuka let out a shrill yell and a large quantity of German profanities, largely directed at Misato.  
明日香发出一声尖锐的叫喊，伴随着大量德语脏话，主要针对美里。

"Damn it!" "该死！"

"Not like we can do anything about it."  
"我们对此也无能为力。"

"Whatever! Just start the damn thing."  
“随便了！快点开始吧。”

Shinji nodded and finally pressed play on the player. He wasn't sure what kind of music he had expected but didn't think he'd be listening to the classics. It really wasn't much different that what he had had on his SDAT and he suddenly felt like asking Misato if he could keep the tape when they were done with it. Turning towards Asuka he was surprised that her face seemed to be fairly passive. Asuka seemed to notice and turned slightly towards him, brushing some of her hair against his forehead. "What?"  
真嗣点点头，终于按下了播放键。他不确定自己期待听到什么样的音乐，但没想到会是古典乐。这与他 SDAT 里的音乐其实没太大差别，他突然有种冲动，想问问美里结束后能否留下这盘磁带。转向明日香，他惊讶地发现她的表情相当平静。明日香似乎注意到了，微微转向他，几缕发丝拂过他的额头。“怎么了？”

"Sorry, I'm just surprised that you're not complaining about the music."  
“抱歉，我只是有点惊讶你居然没抱怨这音乐。”

"Hmph, It could have been a lot worse."  
"哼，本来可能会更糟的。"

"I suppose...but I didn't know that you liked classical music."  
"我想也是……但我没想到你喜欢古典音乐。"

Shrugging Asuka said, "Some of the greatest classical composers are from Germany. When this stuff is blaring out of every cafe on the street corners you grow to enjoy it."  
明日香耸耸肩说：“一些最伟大的古典作曲家来自德国。当这些音乐从每个街角的咖啡馆里传出时，你会逐渐喜欢上它的。”

Shinji hummed his consent.  
真嗣哼了一声表示同意。

Oddly enough they stopped squirming and flinching every time the other would accidently bump into the other. Though there had been a close call when Shinji had accidently brushed Asuka's right breast with his elbow and had almost ushered in the apocalypse. Other than that minor set back they seemed to be getting used to the physical contact.  
奇怪的是，他们不再每次不小心碰到对方时都扭动和退缩。虽然有一次真嗣不小心用肘部擦过明日香的右胸，差点引发了世界末日。除此之外，他们似乎已经习惯了身体接触。

After roughly an hour and a half of sitting their Shinji felt Asuka's stomach next to him let out a loud grumble. Doing his best to not look at her face he failed miserably and noticed that she seemed to be sitting extremely rigid with a slight blush across her face.  
大约坐了一个半小时后，真嗣感觉到明日香肚子旁边传来一声响亮的咕噜声。他尽力不去看她的脸，但失败得很惨，注意到她似乎坐得非常僵硬，脸上泛着淡淡的红晕。

Acting as though he hadn't noticed anything he pulled the bud out of his ear, stretched and said, "I'm gonna start making dinner."  
他装作什么都没注意到，从耳朵里取出那朵花蕾，伸了个懒腰说道：“我要开始做晚饭了。”

"...Fine." "……好吧。"

Dinner was quick and brief with almost no conversation, though for once Asuka offered to clean up instead of Shinji. Gratefully excepting her help, Shinji decided to clear a large enough space in the living room since the two were supposed to sleep in the same room together. Shinji had a sudden mental image of him and Asuka sleeping in a king size bed together, except that it stretched the length of five football fields and they were each on opposite ends. Honestly even in his mind it was an impossible happenstance.  
晚餐迅速而简短，几乎没有交谈，但这次是绫波主动提出帮忙收拾，而不是真嗣。真嗣感激地接受了她的帮助，决定在客厅腾出足够大的空间，因为两人应该睡在同一个房间里。真嗣突然在脑海中浮现出他和绫波睡在一张超大号床上的画面，只是这张床延伸了五个足球场的长度，而他们各自在两端。老实说，即使在他的想象中，这也是不可能发生的。

After rearranging the furniture and T.V. being sure that latter was within viewing distance of wherever Asuka was going to sleep, Shinji grabbed his futon in his room and dragged it into the living room. Asuka did likewise soon after while bringing a few other things with her.  
重新摆放了家具和电视，确保后者在绫波睡觉的地方也能看到，真嗣抓起自己的被褥，拖到客厅。绫波随后也做了同样的事情，并带了一些其他东西。

"I want to make something perfectly clear before we go to sleep."  
"在我们睡觉之前，我想把一件事说清楚。"

Shinji could guess what it was but he asked anyway. "What?"  
真嗣能猜到是什么事，但他还是问了。“什么？”

"First, if I catch you anywhere near myself while I sleep...I Will Kill You."  
"首先，如果我睡觉时发现你在我附近……我会杀了你。"

Shinji took this one to heart.  
真嗣对此深以为然。

"Second," pulling out a piece of scotch tape she stuck a piece of tape in between hers and Shinji's futon. Shinji noticed that she had a substantial amount more room on her side then he did.  
“第二条，”她拿出一片透明胶带，在她的被褥和真嗣的之间贴上了一块胶带。真嗣注意到她的那一边比他的宽敞得多。

"You are not under any circumstances allowed to cross this line. If you do than I will revert to the first one and kill you."  
“无论如何都不许越过这条线。如果你越界了，我就会回到第一条，杀了你。”

It was amazing how calmly she could say these things. Sighing Shinji said, "Do you honestly expect me to do such things?" Her glare was all he needed to shut up.  
她能如此平静地说出这些话，真是令人惊叹。叹了口气，真嗣问道：“你真的指望我去做这些事吗？”她的瞪视足以让他闭嘴。

"This is effective immediately!"  
“这立即生效！”

"Hai, Hai." Without anymore further conversation Shinji got on his futon, rolled onto his side that wasn't face her, and turned on his SDAT. If he had been facing Asuka he might have seen the annoyance that had passed over her face before she stood up. Without caring whether he could hear her or not she said that she was going to take a bath. He long since stopped caring what she did in the bathroom.  
“嗨，嗨。”没有再多说什么，真嗣躺到自己的被褥上，转向没有面对她的那一侧，打开了 SDAT。如果他当时面对着明日香，或许会看到她脸上闪过的恼怒，然后她站起身来。她不在乎他是否能听见，说她要去洗澡。他早已不再关心她在浴室里做什么。

---

Sleep came and went that night. It wasn't so much that they were sharing a room together. Just that both of them were fully aware that the other was awake but wasn't sure if they wanted to talk. So much had happened since they had met.  
那一夜，睡眠时来时去。并非因为他们同处一室，而是两人都清楚对方醒着，却又不确定是否该开口交谈。自相遇以来，发生了太多事。

After many hours had gone by it was fully dark out and Shinji could hear the light breathing of Asuka, somewhere to his right. Rolling over onto his back he caught her in his peripheral vision, it seemed that she really was asleep. Shinji couldn't quite tell but it looked like from the outline of her body that she had fallen asleep while turned towards him. Though she could have tossed and turned several times to get into that position.  
数小时过去，夜色已深，真嗣能听到右边阿斯卡轻柔的呼吸声。他翻身仰躺，用眼角余光瞥见她，似乎真的睡着了。真嗣不太确定，但从她身体的轮廓来看，她似乎是面向他入睡的。尽管她可能在睡梦中翻来覆去多次才变成这个姿势。

Shinji couldn't help but smile slightly. She was on the side furthest from the window and so some of the moonlight was able to seep through the curtain and bathe part of her face in the light. It was times like this that Shinji was glad that he knew her. Almost as though replying to his thoughts Asuka stirred. Shinji immediately switched position and turned the other way, hoping that she hadn't woken up only to find him looking at her.  
真嗣不禁微微一笑。她睡在离窗户最远的一侧，因此些许月光透过窗帘，洒在她脸上。正是这样的时刻，真嗣庆幸自己认识她。仿佛回应他的思绪，阿斯卡动了动。真嗣立刻转身背对她，希望她没有醒来，只是发现他在看她。

She seemed not to have noticed though as he heard her covers shifting slightly as she got up. Shinji tried to keep as still as possible and developed a light breathing so as to fake sleep. After several seconds he heard water coming from the kitchen and assumed that she had just grabbed a glass of water.  
她似乎并未察觉，因为他听到她的被子微微挪动的声音，她起身了。真嗣尽量保持不动，轻缓地呼吸，假装还在熟睡。几秒钟后，他听到厨房传来水声，猜测她可能只是去倒了一杯水。

Sighing in a relieving sort of way he heard the water turn of and her steady footsteps as she walked back to the living room.  
他如释重负地叹了口气，听到水声停止，以及她稳稳走回客厅的脚步声。

'I should really try to get some sleep I suppose. Tomorrow is going to be hectic,' thought Shinji.  
'我真该试着睡一会儿了。明天肯定会很忙，'真嗣心想。

Deciding that the other side was more comfortable he turned on his side, the one facing Asuka and was just prepared to drop of to sleep when he heard something surprising.  
觉得另一侧更舒服，他翻身面向明日香，正准备入睡时，却听到了令人惊讶的声音。

"Baka Shinji, you awake?"  
“笨蛋真嗣，你醒着吗？”

Shinji lay there for a long time without answering. Should he, or should he not reply? Guessing that she knew that he was awake anyway he open his eyes to find her sitting up in her futon with her eyes watching him. It certainly didn't help that the moonlight completely illuminated her now.  
真嗣躺在那里许久没有回答。他该不该回应呢？猜想她已经知道他醒着了，他睁开眼睛，发现她坐在自己的被褥上，眼睛正盯着他。月光此刻完全照亮了她，这无疑增加了他的困扰。

"Yeah...somewhat," mumbled Shinji.  
"嗯...有点吧," 真嗣咕哝道。

"Sorry if you were about to fall asleep."  
"如果你正要睡着了，抱歉。"

"Its okay," said Shinji, shaking off the drowsiness.  
"没关系," 真嗣说着，甩掉了睡意。

"I'm having trouble sleeping..."  
"我最近睡不好..."

"You're not the only one."  
"不止你一个人。"

Asuka turned her head slightly to see Shinji resting on his side watching her.  
明日香微微转头，看到真嗣侧躺着，正注视着她。

"I feel so stupid bothering you with something so trivial as this."  
"我觉得自己好傻，居然为这么点小事打扰你。"

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"...Bad dream." "...噩梦。"

Had it been any other time Shinji probably would have broken several ribs from laughing. For some reason though he could understand where she was coming from. He had certainly had his share of them in the past few weeks.  
如果不是在其他时候，真嗣可能会笑到肋骨断裂。但不知为何，他能够理解她的立场。过去几周里，他确实经历了许多。

"Anything you want to talk about?"  
“有什么想聊的吗？”

"No...its nothing...sorry to bother you."  
“不……没什么……抱歉打扰你了。”

Asuka then rolled back onto her side and faced the wall. Shinji watched her for a few seconds before rolling onto this back and looking up at the ceiling.  
明日香随后翻身侧躺，面向墙壁。真嗣注视了她几秒钟，然后也翻过身来，仰望着天花板。

"I want you to know I'm here...incase you need to talk..."  
“我想让你知道我在这里……如果你需要聊聊的话……”

Shinji then turned his head slightly and thought he caught a slight moving of her head to indicate she understood.  
真嗣微微转过头，感觉自己似乎捕捉到了她轻微的点头，表示她明白了。

"Thanks...Baka." "谢谢...笨蛋。"

Shinji almost scoffed. Even when she was showing vulnerability she never forgot to throw an insult in his direction. Well, if it made her more secure, he supposed it was all right.  
真嗣差点嗤之以鼻。即使在她表现出脆弱的时候，她也从未忘记朝他扔一句侮辱。好吧，如果这能让她更有安全感，他想这也没什么。

"Night, Asuka." "晚安，明日香。"

After a very long pause during which Shinji was close to drifting off he thought her heard, "Night, Shinji."  
在一段漫长的停顿后，真嗣几乎要睡着时，他以为自己听到了，“晚安，真嗣。”

### Chapter 8: Pain

"Damn it baka! What the hell do you think you're doing."  
"该死的笨蛋！你到底在搞什么鬼。"

"You're moving way to fast! How the hell do you expect me to keep up."  
"你动作太快了！我怎么可能跟得上。"

Misato shrugged as once again they traded verbal abuse. She was too use to it by now and popped the top off another beer.  
美里耸了耸肩，他们再次互相言语攻击。她现在已经习惯了，随手打开另一罐啤酒。

It was only the second day since they had started using the dance simulation and so far Misato thought that Nerv was wasting millions on this project. Well, it was her decision in the first place, so if anyone was screwed, it was her.  
这只是他们开始使用舞蹈模拟的第二天，到目前为止，美里认为 NERV 在这个项目上浪费了数百万。好吧，这本来就是她的决定，所以如果有人搞砸了，那就是她。

Asuka and Shinji hadn't shown a shred of improvement, Misato actually thought they had gotten worse since they started. From what she could tell it was simply a bad paring. Asuka usually kept the pace faster then Shinji could keep up and once or twice Misato had to tell Asuka to slow down so to let Shinji keep up. Asuka replied that he was just a bad dancer to which Shinji replied Asuka was just more flexible. After that Shinji had almost been castrated...by Asuka's foot. Misato wasn't even sure how many beers she had drunken over the past few days, but it wasn't enough if she was still remembering this stuff.  
明日香和真嗣没有表现出丝毫的进步，美里甚至觉得他们自从开始练习后变得更糟了。据她观察，这只是个糟糕的组合。明日香通常保持比真嗣能跟上的更快的节奏，有一两次美里不得不告诉明日香放慢速度，以便真嗣能跟上。明日香回答说他只是个糟糕的舞者，而真嗣则回应说明日香只是更灵活。之后，真嗣差点被明日香的脚踢中要害。美里不确定过去几天她喝了多少啤酒，但如果她还在记着这些事，那肯定是不够的。

After roughly two hours of non-stop practice Misato called a halt finally. Getting off the couch she said, "Thats enough for now I suppose. Anymore and you'll just end up killing each other."  
大约两个小时的连续练习后，美里终于叫停了。她从沙发上站起来说：“我想现在够了。再练下去，你们只会互相伤害。”

"God damn it, finally," said Asuka tearing off the headphones that had been resting on her head. Falling flat on the floor she rested there for a few minutes, letting the beads of sweating drip off her forehead. Shinji had done likewise, though far enough away so she wouldn't have a reason to pick a fight.  
“该死的，终于结束了，”明日香说着，摘下了戴在头上的耳机。她直接瘫倒在地板上，休息了几分钟，让汗水从额头上滴落。真嗣也做了同样的事，只是离得足够远，以免她找到挑衅的理由。

"Well, that was a little better than today's earlier attempt," said Misato.  
“嗯，这比今天早些时候的尝试要好一些，”美里说。

Asuka and Shinji both started slightly, they were remembering the performance from earlier. Somehow Shinji had managed to trip over his own feet and gone cascading into Asuka's chest, knocking them both over. Shinji still winced slightly as he remembered the pain she had inflicted on him after that.  
明日香和真嗣都微微一惊，他们想起了早先的那一幕。不知怎么的，真嗣竟然绊倒了自己的脚，一头栽进了明日香的怀里，两人一起摔倒在地。真嗣至今还记得她那之后给他的疼痛，不禁微微皱眉。

"Tch, pervert," mumbled Asuka.  
“嘁，变态，”明日香低声咕哝道。

Shinji glared in her direction and received one in return. How many times did he have to tell her that it was an accident?  
真嗣朝她的方向瞪了一眼，她也回瞪过来。他得告诉她多少次那只是个意外？

"Well, no matter," said Misato vaporizing the hostile environment. "At least you've improved a little so I suppose its a start."  
"嗯，没关系，" 美里消散了敌对的环境，"至少你有所进步，我想这是个开始。"

"I could do this so much quicker if it was just myself," replied Asuka.  
"如果只是我自己，我能更快完成，" 明日香回答道。"

Misato didn't even bother listening to her. She had to tell her almost every hour that it was impossible without Shinji.  
美里甚至懒得听她说话。她几乎每小时都要告诉明日香，没有真嗣是不可能的。

"Okay an hour for lunch, then back to work."  
"好吧，午餐一小时，然后继续工作。"

"Thats it?" "就这样？"

"You should be glad that its not less."  
"你应该庆幸不是更短。"

Asuka threw Misato a scowl and tromped her way into the kitchen. She still hadn't gotten over the embarrassment that she had suffered at school. Though on the plus they hadn't gone back since that day.  
明日香向美里投去一个白眼，然后大步走进厨房。她仍然没有从在学校遭受的尴尬中恢复过来。不过好在那之后他们就没再回去过。

After a long pause during which Shinji contemplated getting up he heard an angry snarl from the kitchen.  
在一段长时间的停顿中，真嗣考虑着是否要站起来，这时他听到厨房传来一声愤怒的咆哮。

"Shinji, food. Now!" “真嗣，吃的。现在！”

Shinji had half a mind to tell her to fix herself something but knew he'd regret it later. Ignoring a funny look that Misato was giving him he slowly sat up, wiping some sweat off his forehead and walked into the kitchen to prepare lunch.  
真嗣本想告诉她自己弄点吃的，但又知道事后会后悔。无视美里投来的奇怪眼神，他缓缓坐起身，擦去额头上的汗水，走进厨房准备午餐。

---

"Why the hell are we doing this?"  
“我们到底为什么要做这个？”

"Because the teacher asked us to."  
“因为老师要求我们这么做。”

"So, he could have gotten somebody else to do it."  
"所以，他本可以找别人来做这件事的。"

"Be we do know Shinji the best."  
"但我们最了解真嗣。"

"Yeah but why did she have to come with us," said Touji jerking a finger behind him at Hikari who was following himself and Kensuke at a distance.  
"是啊，但她为什么非得跟我们一起，" 说着，冬二用手指了指身后，光子正远远地跟在他和健介后面。"

Puffing up her cheeks in an irritated way, Hikari replied, "Because the teacher asked me to give Asuka her homework."  
光子鼓起脸颊，气呼呼地回答：“因为老师让我把明日香的作业交给她。”

"So! Those two live together so it would have been a hell of a lot easier just to send one person."  
“所以！她们俩住在一起，直接派一个人去不就省事多了。”

This was apparently news to Hikari as she stammered wildly while indecent thoughts raced through her head.  
这对光子来说显然是个新消息，她结结巴巴，脑海中闪过各种不雅的念头。

"Wh-Wh-WHAT? THEY LIVE TOGETHER?"  
"什-什-什么？他们同居了？"

"Course," replied Kensuke. "I thought that everybody in the school knew that by now. They always come to class at the same time, and their bentos are the exact same."  
"当然，"" 健介回答道。""我以为现在学校里每个人都知道了。他们总是同时来上课，而且他们的便当也一模一样。"

"I-I just thought that they lived really close to each other."  
"我-我只是以为他们住得非常近而已。"

"Naw. They've been living together for a while now."  
"不，他们已经同居一段时间了。"

"Bu-By themselves." "但-但是，他们自己住。"

"No, they got some guardian that looks after them I think."  
"不，我想他们有个监护人照顾他们。"

"By the way Kensuke, where does this Misato live anyway?"  
"话说，真希，这个美里到底住在哪里啊？"

"I'm not really sure," said Kensuke looking down at the poorly drawn map. "The directions that the teacher gave me weren't exactly well explained."  
"我也不太确定，" 真希低头看着那张画得不太好的地图说道。"老师给我的指示解释得不是很清楚。"

"Probably didn't even care if they got their homework or not."  
"可能根本不在乎他们交不交作业吧。"

"Oh, move over already!" Yelled Hikari while swiping the map out of Kensuke's hands.  
"哦，快挪开！" 光一边喊着，一边从健介手里抢过地图。

After several minutes of analyzing the teachers poor handwriting Hikari settled on a location.  
经过几分钟仔细辨认老师糟糕的字迹后，光确定了一个地点。

"Follow me you stooges." "跟我来，你们这群傻瓜。"

Kensuke let out a sigh while Touji whispered something to him. "I see why she and Asuka get along so well."  
健介叹了口气，而冬二在他耳边低语。“我明白为什么她和明日香相处得那么好了。”

After another fifteen minutes the three found themselves standing outside an apartment door. According to Hikari this was where Misato Katsuragi lived, and apparently two others.  
又过了十五分钟，三人站在了一扇公寓门前。据光说，这是葛城美里住的地方，而且显然还有另外两个人。

"Well, go ahead and knock," said Kensuke.  
“好了，去敲门吧，”健介说道。

"Why me," replied Hikari looking over her shoulder?  
“为什么是我，”光回头看着肩膀说？

"Because your the one that led us here idiot," said Touji.  
“因为你这个白痴带我们来的，”阿透说。

Hikari threw a scowl over her shoulder before taking a deep breadth and knocking twice on the door.  
光回头瞪了一眼，深吸一口气，然后敲了两下门。

After several seconds they thought they heard several footsteps and then the unlatching of the door. Whatever they had thought originally was blown out the door as Misato opened it.  
几秒钟后，他们以为听到了几声脚步声，接着是门闩被拉开的声音。无论他们最初的想法是什么，都在 Misato 打开门的那一刻被吹散了。

"Hai?" “嗨？”

Hikari, Kensuke, and Touji were unable to say a word. They hadn't been expecting this and for a moment were about to pass off the apartment number as a mistake when they heard Asuka's unmistakable voice coming from somewhere inside. Misato had a beer in one hand and the T.V. remote in the other. What's more she seemed to have adopted the Asuka attitude and decided to walk around the house in her underwear. Kensuke and Touji almost dropped dead of a bloody nose and it was only the dark aura that had settled around Hikari that kept them in check.  
光、真希波和东治一句话也说不出来。他们完全没有预料到这种情况，有那么一刻，他们几乎要把公寓号码当作一个错误时，突然听到了从屋内传来的明日香那 unmistakable 的声音。Misato 一手拿着啤酒，另一手拿着电视遥控器。更甚的是，她似乎采纳了明日香的态度，决定只穿着内衣在家里走来走去。真希波和东治差点因为鼻血喷涌而倒下，只有环绕在光周围的黑暗气场让他们保持了镇定。

"Ah you must be Asuka and Shinji's friends from school."  
"啊，你们一定是明日香和真嗣的学校朋友吧。"

Kensuke and Touji nodded with a hand over their noses while Hikari simply frowned.  
剑介和东治捂着鼻子点头，而光则只是皱了皱眉。

"Well I can understand why you'd be wondering about them. Coming to school oddly dressed and then not coming to school for two days, is a little odd."  
"嗯，我能理解你们为什么会对他们感到好奇。穿着奇怪的衣服来学校，然后又两天没来上学，确实有点奇怪。"

"We brought the homework they've missed," said Hikari speaking up.  
"我们带来了他们错过的作业。"光开口说道。

"Ah good. I was meaning to have someone pick it up but just didn't have the time."  
"啊，太好了。我正想着让人去取，但就是没时间。"

A small pause erupted as Touji and Kensuke continued to stare at Misato.  
短暂的停顿中，真治和健介继续盯着美里。

"Would you like to come in?"  
"你想进来吗？"

Kensuke and Touji practically leapt at the opportunity.  
真嗣和冬二几乎是一跃而起，抓住了这个机会。

After taking their shoes off hastily, they followed Misato into the living room were they could hear an odd assortment of noises going on.  
匆忙脱下鞋子后，他们跟着美里进了客厅，那里传来一阵奇怪的声响。

"Hey Shinji what's-" Though Kensuke was silenced as something went flying past him and struck the opposite wall.  
"嘿，真嗣，怎么了——" 但话未说完，肯斯克就被什么东西飞快地掠过，撞到了对面的墙上。

"DAMN IT BAKA! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU TO NOT LAG BEHIND!"  
"该死的笨蛋！我得告诉你多少次，不要拖后腿！"

Touji had to cover his ears so they wouldn't explode from Asuka's outburst. Kensuke meanwhile had his hands over his head expecting to be dismembered any second. Realizing that Asuka's anger wasn't directed towards him, he turned towards his right to see what had flown past him. Shinji was sprawled in a heap against the wall with his legs sticking up in the air and his shoulders resting on the ground. He had a red foot mark on his cheek.  
托吉不得不捂住耳朵，以免被明日香的大吼震聋。肯斯克则双手抱头，以为自己随时会被撕成碎片。意识到明日香的怒火并非针对他，他转向右边，想看看刚才飞过去的是什么。真嗣瘫倒在墙边，双腿翘起，肩膀贴地，脸颊上有一个红色的脚印。

"Sh-Shinji?" “真-真嗣？”

Shinji realized then that other people were in the house besides him, Asuka, and Misato.  
那时，真嗣意识到房子里除了他、明日香和美里之外还有其他人。

"Kensuke? What are you doing here," he replied, moving around so he could see who else was in the room? Asuka apparently noticed that they weren't the only ones here either as she saw Hikari.  
“健介？你在这里做什么，”他回答道，移动位置以便能看到房间里还有谁？明日香显然也注意到他们不是唯一在场的人，因为她看到了光。

"Ah, the teacher wanted us to give you your homework for the past few days. Hikari tagged along to give Asuka hers as well."  
“啊，老师让我们把这几天的作业给你。光也跟着一起来给明日香送她的作业。”

"Ah thanks, I think. Homework was the furthest from my mind."  
"啊，谢谢，我想是的。作业完全不在我脑海里。"

"Same," replied Asuka. "一样，" 明日香回答道。"

"Well, if you two fall behind on your studies then I couldn't call myself a proper guardian," said Misato speaking up.  
"好吧，如果你们两个学业落后了，那我就不能称自己为称职的监护人了，" 美里开口说道。"

"But homework compared to this."  
“但和这个比起来，作业算什么。”

Hikari, Kensuke, and Touji suddenly realized what she ment by this. They were both wearing the same dancing outfits that they had worn to school that day, though it was what they were doing with them that seemed odd. In the middle of the living room was an odd looking contraption. The floor was covered with two large black mats that had oddly placed colors around it. In the back round of each was something that looked like a scoreboard. Currently each side showed zero.  
光、健介和透突然明白了她所说的‘这个’是什么意思。他们都穿着那天上学时的同款舞蹈服装，只不过他们用这些服装做的事情显得有些奇怪。客厅中央是一个看起来很奇怪的装置。地板上铺着两块巨大的黑色垫子，上面零星分布着奇怪的颜色。每块垫子后面都有个看起来像计分板的东西。目前两边都显示着零分。

Touji was about to open his mouth to ask if this is what Shinji and Asuka had been talking about when they were up on the roof three days ago when Kensuke elbowed him in the ribs. Hikari wasn't supposed to know about the Evangelions, and they weren't even sure if they were supposed to know.  
透正要开口问这是否就是真嗣和明日香三天前在屋顶上谈论的内容时，健介用胳膊肘撞了撞他的肋骨。光不应该知道关于 EVA 的事，他们甚至不确定自己是否应该知道。

"You two look as stupid as ever," said Touji commenting on their outfits.  
"你们俩看起来还是一如既往的蠢，" 冬二评论着他们的装扮。

"How bout I punch a hole clear through that smirking face of yours ass-hole," said Asuka acidly. That shut Touji up for a while.  
"要不我直接在你那张得意洋洋的脸上打个洞，混蛋，" 明日香尖刻地说道。这番话让冬二安静了一阵子。

"So what are you two supposed to be doing with this...odd thing?" Asked Hikari.  
"那么你们俩打算用这个...奇怪的东西做什么？" 光问道。

Asuka and Shinji both started stammering their own versions of things when Misato intervened. "Why don't you two just show them what you're doing. Its certainly a lot easier than explaining this."  
当美里介入时，明日香和真嗣都开始结结巴巴地各自解释。“你们俩为什么不直接展示给他们看呢？这肯定比解释要简单得多。”

"No! I don't want them to see me doing something this humiliating," said Asuka.  
“不！我不想让他们看到我做这么丢脸的事，”明日香说道。

Sighing Shinji said, "C'mon, Asuka. Lets just show them. Its not like we can embarrass ourselves any further."  
真嗣叹了口气说：“来吧，明日香。我们就给他们看看。反正我们也不可能再更尴尬了。”

Asuka turned towards him then with a glint in her eyes that could kill and Shinji almost took a step back.  
明日香转向他，眼中闪烁着能杀人的光芒，真嗣几乎下意识地后退了一步。

"Damn it, fine! But if you screw up again I'll break that damn scoreboard over your head!"  
“该死，好吧！但如果你再搞砸，我就会把那该死的计分板砸在你头上！”

"Hai, Hai. Lets just get this over with."  
“嗨，嗨。赶紧结束这一切吧。”

Asuka glared at him once more before taking her place own place on the mat next to his. After dawning both sets of headphones they both closed their eyes and their bodies started to move.  
明日香再次瞪了他一眼，然后在自己的位置上坐下，就在他旁边。两人都戴上耳机后，闭上眼睛，身体开始随着音乐舞动。

Hikari and the other two were both wide mouthed, gaping at the pair as they attempted to replicate each others movements based solely on the song. Misato, in the back round, had long stopped paying attention to how they were doing.  
光和另外两人都目瞪口呆，看着这对搭档试图仅凭歌曲来模仿对方的动作。美里在后面，早已不再关注他们的表现。

It was a bit depressing really. Shinji sped up and slowed down at random times while Asuka seemed to get faster and faster with each movement to the point where Shinji was about to pass out from trying to catch up. Very rarely did the score even get above five when Misato said that one hundred was a requirement for what they were doing. Though she didn't say what, since the other three weren't supposed to know of the Evangelions.  
这确实有点令人沮丧。真嗣时而加速时而减速，而明日香的动作却越来越快，快到真嗣几乎要因为追赶而晕倒。当美里说他们需要达到一百分时，分数很少能超过五分，尽管她没有说明原因，因为其他三人并不应该知道关于 EVA 的事情。

After a painful ten minutes Shinji finally tripped over his own feet in exhaustion and went face first down onto the floor. Asuka twitched slightly as she opened her eyes and saw a passed out Shinji on the floor and was just thinking of bashing him over the head with his own scoreboard when he stirred.  
经过痛苦的十分钟后，真嗣终于因疲惫不堪绊倒了自己的双脚，脸朝下摔在了地板上。明日香微微抽动了一下，睁开眼睛看到昏倒在地的真嗣，正想着用他的记分板敲他的头时，他动了动。

"Damn it! Why can't we do this."  
“该死！为什么我们做不到。”

"Its because you can't keep the pace."  
“那是因为你跟不上节奏。”

"No. You're moving at an inhuman pace. How the hell do you expect me to keep up with that!  
"不，你跑得跟非人类似的。你到底要我怎么跟得上那种速度！

"Baka, you're useless." "笨蛋，你真没用。

"You certainly can't be counted as perfect either."  
"你也不能算完美。

"Tch, I'm much better at this and piloting Eva then you'll ever be!"  
"哼，我在这方面和驾驶 Eva 比你强多了！"

"What's Eva?" "Eva 是什么？"

Shinji and Asuka spun towards at the sound of Hikari's voice while the others seemed to do the same, including Misato.  
听到 Hikari 的声音，Shinji 和 Asuka 转身望去，其他人似乎也做了同样的动作，包括 Misato。

"Eh heh... What Hikari?" Asked Asuka who's mouth was slightly twitching at the corners.  
"欸嘿...什么光？" 明日香问道，嘴角微微抽搐。

"I said what's Eva? Does it have something to do with this...thing?"  
"我说，Eva 是什么？它和这个...东西有关吗？"

"Ah well..." "啊，这个嘛..."

Sighing Misato sat up and quickly thought up a decent enough lie to make the situation pass by.  
叹了口气，美里坐起身来，迅速想出了一个还算过得去的谎言，让情况得以顺利过去。

"Eva is a game at the arcade that Asuka and Shinji compete against each sometimes. Shinji hasn't won once."  
“Eva 是游戏厅里的一款游戏，明日香和真嗣有时会互相对抗。真嗣一次都没赢过。”

"Hmmm? I don't think I've ever heard of that."  
“嗯？我想我从未听说过那个。”

"Ah...its fairly new," said Shinji catching on to the situation. Asuka appeared to be angry though at Misato's blatant lie. It made her look like a nerd.  
“啊……这还挺新的，”真嗣察觉到了情况，说道。虽然明日香看起来对美里明显的谎言感到愤怒，这让她显得像个书呆子。

"Well, I think these two need to get back to training. So I think that I'll have to ask you three to leave now," said a smiling Misato. Though in truth she was trying to reduce the effects of having the Evas spoken of.  
“嗯，我想这两个人需要回去训练了。所以我想我得请你们三位现在离开，”美里笑着说。虽然实际上她是在试图减少提及 EVA 的影响。

"Okay. When do you think you'll be back to school Shinji?"  
“好的。你觉得你什么时候能回学校，真嗣？”

"A week or so...maybe more."  
"大约一周...或许更久。"

"Okay I'll bring more homework in a few days."  
"好的，我过几天再带更多作业来。"

"Can't wait," grumbled Shinji.  
"等不及了，"真嗣咕哝道。

After Kensuke, Hikari, and Touji left Misato stormed into the living room only to find Shinji and Asuka in another heated argument.  
在真嗣、美里和冬二离开后，律子怒气冲冲地走进客厅，却发现真希波和绫人在激烈争吵。

"HEY!" "嘿！"

Asuka and Shinji stopped yelling in each others faces briefly to turn and see an angry, red faced, Misato.  
真希波和绫人暂时停止了面对面的争吵，转头看向满脸通红、怒气冲冲的律子。

"Do you two have any idea how close you were to letting the world know about the Evangelions."  
"你们俩知不知道刚才差点就让全世界知道 EVA 的存在了。"

"Is it that big a deal?"  
"有那么严重吗？"

"Of course it is! While their aren't many in existence if regular citizens knew about them then they'd want to start sticking around during battles and taking pictures. Not to mention every child your age would want to pilot one."  
"当然严重！虽然 EVA 数量不多，但如果普通市民知道了，他们就会想在战斗时围观拍照。更别提每个像你这么大的孩子都会想成为驾驶员。"

Shinji snorted. After five minutes in an entry plug they'd be having second thoughts.  
真嗣哼了一声。在插入栓里待上五分钟，他们就会开始犹豫了。

"Anyway break time over, back to work."  
“总之，休息时间结束，回去工作。”

Both Shinji and Asuka continued laying there though. Neither of them wanting to be the first one to stand, though it was Asuka that broke the silence.  
然而，真嗣和明日香仍然躺在那里。谁也不想第一个站起来，尽管是明日香打破了沉默。

"Why bother doing this anymore. Its obvious that we can't do this because I'm just so much better than this baka is."  
“为什么还要费这个劲。很明显我们做不了这个，因为我比这个笨蛋强太多了。”

"Okay Asuka," said Misato as a smirk started to develop across her face. "I can either bring in Rei and her and Shinji can start practicing this for the battle against the angel. Or you can match your speed to Shinji's and continue with this."  
“好吧，明日香，”美里说着，脸上开始浮现出一丝得意的笑容。“我可以叫来绫波，她和真嗣可以开始为对抗使徒的战斗练习。或者你可以调整你的速度，和真嗣一起继续。”

Asuka opened her mouth at first to yell out an angry retort, but then ended up shutting it. Above all else she didn't want the first child and Shinji taking part in the operation. It would seriously hurt her pride if she wasn't able to complete this.  
明日香一开始张嘴想要怒吼反驳，但最终还是闭上了嘴。最重要的是，她不希望第一适格者和真嗣参与这次行动。如果她不能完成这个任务，那会严重伤害她的自尊。

"Fine! I'll slow down!" Sitting up promptly, she grabbed Shinji's wrist and started dragging him over to the machine.  
“好啦！我会慢点！”她迅速坐起身，抓住真嗣的手腕，开始拉着他向机器走去。

"Eh Asuka, wait." “哎，明日香，等等。”

"I'm not waiting and I'm certainly not wasting all the hard work that we've done by giving this to Rei."  
“我不会等，更不会因为要把这个给丽而浪费我们所有的努力。”

"Err, what hard work?" "呃，什么辛苦活？"

Asuka turned towards Shinji and threw him one of her usual glares before saying, "Just get on your damn mat."  
明日香转向真嗣，朝他投去她惯常的瞪视，然后说道：“赶紧上你的垫子。”

"You don't have to be so forceful."  
"你不必这么强硬。"

"I just want to get this over with."  
"我只是想快点结束这件事。"

"Hai, Hai. Same here." "是啊，是啊。我也是。"

After sometime later Misato glanced over at the two who had not moved from the mats since they had agreed on finishing it. With a slight grin on her face she thought, 'I suppose that we might start seeing some results,' as she glanced at the scoreboard to see that they had reached fifteen as their highest score.  
过了一段时间后，美里瞥向那两个自从同意完成任务后就没从垫子上动过的人。她脸上带着一丝微笑，心想：'我想我们可能会开始看到一些成果了，'同时她瞥了一眼记分牌，看到他们已经达到了十五分，这是他们的最高分。

'Well, they still have a ways to go,' she sighed as she saw Asuka ripping off her headphones and smacking Shinji in the face.  
'唉，他们还有很长的路要走，'她叹息着，看到明日香扯下耳机，猛地扇了真嗣一巴掌。

---

"Ah that feels so much better," sighed Asuka as she stepped into the living room with a wet towel draped over her head. It was many hours after they had finished their day of training and were rather proud of themselves as they had reached twenty on the high score.  
“啊，这样感觉好多了，”明日香叹道，她头上搭着一条湿毛巾走进客厅。距离他们结束一天的训练已经过去好几个小时了，他们颇为自豪，因为在高分榜上达到了二十名。

After looking around quickly, she realized that Shinji was the only one in the living room.  
她迅速环顾四周，意识到客厅里只有真嗣一个人。

"Oi baka, where did Misato go?"  
"喂，笨蛋，美里去哪儿了？"

"She mentioned something about going to a bar," said Shinji as he idly turned a page of the book he was reading.  
"她提到了去酒吧的事，" 真嗣一边说着，一边漫不经心地翻着他正在读的书的一页。"

"Tch. Why is she always gone during nights? Whether its work or drinking, she's rarely home."  
"啧。为什么她晚上总是不在？无论是工作还是喝酒，她很少在家。"

"Maybe thats just something that comes with being an adult."  
"或许这就是成为成年人的一部分吧。"

"Well I certainly hope I'm not like Misato when I'm her age. Anyway same rules apply as usual."  
"嗯，我当然希望我到她那个年纪时不会像美里那样。总之，和往常一样，规则不变。"

"You don't have to keep reminding me," said Shinji as he turned his head towards her. Asuka had moved from the doorway and was kneeling over her futon.  
"你不必一直提醒我，" 真嗣说着，将头转向她。明日香已经从门口走过来，跪在她的被褥旁。

"I Don't Trust You!" "我不信任你！"

"If I haven't done anything to you the first three nights, what makes you think I'd do something tonight."  
"如果我前三个晚上都没对你做什么，你凭什么认为我今晚会有所行动。"

Asuka scowled at him for a moment before spinning around and turning on the T.V.  
明日香瞪了他一会儿，然后转身打开了电视。

"Baka!" "笨蛋！"

Shinji simply shrugged and went back to reading. It was really the same thing every night. So far, before they decided to go to bed, Asuka would draw the line that he was not allowed to pass and remind him not to do anything perverted. To that he would usually reply with some sarcastic comment that would tick her off. Though he wasn't really in the mood for it tonight.  
真嗣只是耸了耸肩，继续阅读。每晚都是如此。到目前为止，在他们决定上床睡觉之前，明日香会划出他不能逾越的界限，并提醒他不要做任何变态的事情。对此，他通常会用一些讽刺的评论来回应，让她生气。不过今晚他真的没心情这么做。

Closing the book he was reading Shinji sat up and said, "Not that I expect it but is their any hot water left for another shower."  
合上正在阅读的书，真嗣坐起身来说道：“虽然我不抱希望，但还有热水可以再洗个澡吗？”

Without turning around Asuka mumbled, "Find out for yourself, baka."  
明日香没有转身，咕哝着说：“自己去找，笨蛋。”

Needlessly to say, several minutes later, Shinji was cursing as the cold water hit his face.  
无需多言，几分钟后，真嗣便在冷水拍打脸颊时咒骂起来。

---

After the first night of sleeping together in the same room they both became quickly accustomed to it. Its not like they were sleeping in the same bed or anything. Even so, Shinji drifted in and out of sleep occasionally. Sometimes it was due to dreams, of which he'd rather not remember, and other times it was because Asuka seemed to wake him up. Though not on purpose as it was usually through her mumbling. Shinji was an unusually light sleeper.  
自从第一晚同处一室后，他们很快就适应了这种生活。并非同床共枕，即便如此，真嗣还是时不时地陷入半梦半醒之间。有时是因为梦境，那些他宁愿遗忘的梦，有时则是因为明日香似乎在无意中吵醒了他，通常是通过她的喃喃自语。真嗣是个异常浅眠的人。

Tonight though, a dream he had been having within the past two days woke him up suddenly.  
然而今晚，过去两天里反复出现的梦境突然将他惊醒。

Shinji's eyes flew open as the dream ended and he sat up, shivering uncontrollably. Cold sweat clung to his body and dripped off his forehead and he suddenly had an urge to rip off the loose tank-top that he was wearing.  
梦醒时分，真嗣的双眼猛地睁开，他坐起身来，无法控制地颤抖着。冷汗浸透了他的身体，从额头上滴落，他突然有种冲动，想要扯掉身上那件宽松的背心。

Running a weary hand down his face, wiping off some of the sweat in the process, he glanced over at the pile of blankets that was Asuka.  
他疲惫地用手抹了一把脸，顺便擦去了一些汗水，然后瞥向那堆毯子，那里躺着的是明日香。

'Good,' he thought. 'I didn't wake her.'  
“还好，”他心想，“没吵醒她。”

Turning back to his dreams he tried to recall it, but he could only remember small details. It was like trying to keep water in your cupped hands. He could only remember the same thing from the past nights and that seemed to be some stranger ringing the door bell at Misato's apartment. Shinji had then gone to open the door and was greeted with a tall man in an overcoat who had sunken white eyes. Shinji knew that he had never seen somebody like that in his life and wondered why he would be dreaming something like that. The man spoke several words but Shinji was never able to hear them as the dreaming started dissolving at that point.  
他转而回想自己的梦境，试图记起细节，但只能捕捉到零星片段，犹如试图用双手捧住水一般。他只能回忆起过去几晚的相同情景，似乎是有人在真嗣的公寓按门铃。真嗣随后去开门，迎面是一个身穿大衣、眼窝深陷的白眼男子。真嗣确信自己从未在生活中见过这样的人，不禁疑惑为何会梦到这样的情景。那男子说了几句话，但真嗣始终听不清，因为梦境此时开始消散。

Flopping back down in his own pile of blankets he racked his brain again to think if he had ever seen anybody that might even mildly fit the description. Though nothing clicked.  
他颓然倒回自己的被褥堆中，再次绞尽脑汁回想是否曾见过任何与描述稍稍相符的人。然而，毫无头绪。

He could only ascertain this as something to do with his visions, which he now guessed were starting to get stronger. Though he had no idea how this man was related to them.  
他只能推测这与他的幻觉有关，如今他猜测这些幻觉正变得越来越强烈。尽管他完全不知道这个男人与它们有何关联。

Turning over on his side he closed his eyes for a moment and opened them again in a flash when he heard movement on the other side of the room. Seemed that Asuka was restless again.  
他侧身翻转，闭上眼睛片刻，随即又因听到房间另一侧的动静而猛地睁开。看来明日香又失眠了。

She was tossing and turning again like the previous nights and was mumbling something indistinguishable. The first time that this had happened Shinji had almost gotten up and woken her, but thought better at then end as she would certainly abuse him afterwards. Though each time it tugged at his heart a little.  
她像前几晚一样辗转反侧，嘴里嘟囔着听不清的话语。第一次发生这种情况时，真嗣差点起身叫醒她，但最终还是理智占了上风，因为她醒来后肯定会对他大发雷霆。尽管每次都让他的心微微揪紧。

Here was practically the complete opposite of the Asuka that he knew. A girl that didn't want to show her helplessness, but was most helpless while she was sleeping. Shinji could only guess what her dreams were like as she relived her past repetitively. It was the times that she whimpered and called out for her mom that particularly pushed the boundaries of his resolve to not cross that invisible line. And it seemed that tonight was such a night as he heard her mumble a few words in which he caught, Mom and go. If Shinji had to guess she was begging her mom to not leave her.  
这几乎是他所认识的明日香完全相反的一面。一个不愿展现无助的女孩，却在睡梦中最为无助。真嗣只能猜测她的梦境，她一遍遍重温过去的梦。每当她呜咽着呼唤妈妈时，特别考验他不去逾越那条无形界限的决心。今晚似乎又是这样的夜晚，他听到她含糊地说了几个词，捕捉到了“妈妈”和“走”。如果真嗣要猜，她大概是在恳求妈妈不要离开她。

Really he wasn't sure how much more he could take as he rolled back over trying to ignore her whimpering. What was he supposed to do? Rush over there, embrace her, and whisper into her ear that everything was going to be okay and that he was going to protect her. He'd get a swift kick to the groin for even thinking about that.  
真的，他不确定自己还能承受多少，当他翻身回去试图忽略她的呜咽声时。他该怎么办？冲过去，拥抱她，对着她的耳朵低语一切都会好起来的，他会保护她。光是这么想，他都觉得自己会狠狠地挨上一脚。

After several minutes of her mumbling as his mind argued back and forth, she finally seemed to settle down. Shinji therefore let out an audible sigh at the ceiling and closed his eyes as though relishing in the piece. Though something tugged at the back of his head and he heard a familiar voice say, "Coward."  
经过几分钟她喃喃自语，他的内心反复争论，她终于似乎平静了下来。于是，真嗣对着天花板长长地叹了口气，闭上了眼睛，仿佛在享受这份宁静。然而，有什么东西在他脑海中拉扯，他听到一个熟悉的声音说：“懦夫。”

Sitting bolt upright in his makeshift bed he spun to his right, only to see somebody that he wished he never had to look at again. What he called pseudo Asuka was staring back at him while sitting on the ground with her back against the couch which was pushed up against the wall.  
他猛地坐直在临时床上，转身向右，却看到了一个他希望永远不必再见的人。他称之为伪明日香的人正坐在地上，背靠着推到墙边的沙发，回望着他。

Shinji mouth seemed to gape openly, unable to contemplate what was going on. Though after she seemed to sneer at him, he came to his senses. Still unsure whether it was in his mind or not he hissed into the room, "What the hell are you doing here? I thought that I was done with you."  
真嗣的嘴巴似乎张得大大的，无法理解正在发生的事情。尽管在她似乎对他嗤之以鼻后，他恢复了理智。仍然不确定这是否是他的错觉，他对着房间低声说道，“你到底在这里做什么？我以为我已经和你没关系了。”

"Ah did you miss me?"  
“啊，你想我了吗？”

"Tch. As if." “哼，怎么可能。”

"I feel heartbroken. Well, I suppose thats an understatement for what's to come anyway."  
"我感觉心碎了。好吧，我想这还不足以形容即将发生的事情。"

It took Shinji half a second to respond to this statement and he nearly shouted it.  
真嗣花了半秒钟回应这句话，他几乎是大声喊出来的。

"What the hell do you mean!"  
"你到底是什么意思！"

"Calm down, you'll find out soon enough. Anyway why aren't you comforting her. If you were in her position how would you feel?"  
"冷静点，你很快就会知道了。话说回来，你为什么不安慰她呢？如果你处在她的位置，你会怎么想？"

"I have no idea because I can hardly read her."  
"我完全摸不透她的心思，所以无从得知。"

"Maybe you should try?" "或许你应该试试看？"

"Why bother. Every time I do she just rebukes me."  
"何必费心呢。每次我这么做，她都只是斥责我。"

"Didn't seem like that last time. You two were all over each other."  
"上次可不像那样。你们俩亲密得不得了。"

"Y-You know about that?" "你……你知道那件事？"

"Course I know about that baka!"  
"当然我知道那个笨蛋！"

Shinji had a sudden urge to laugh at her use of the Asuka he knew favorite phrase. It was so similar.  
真嗣突然有种想笑的冲动，因为她用了他所熟悉的明日香最喜欢的那句话。太相似了。

"So did you just start talking to me again to torment me some more."  
"所以你又开始跟我说话，就是为了再折磨我一番吗？"

"Mah...you could say that I guess."  
"嗯...可以这么说吧，我想。"

"You don't sound to sure."  
"你听起来不太确定。"

"I can't tell you to much. I'm merely here to see how your decisions change things."  
"我不能告诉你太多。我只是来看看你的决定如何改变一切。"

"Full of helpful information as usual."  
"一如既往地充满有用信息。"

"Arigato." "谢谢。"

"Whatever..." "随便吧..."

After a small pause pseudo Asuka asked, "If she sincerely asked you to help her...would you be able to? If she asked you to throw away your humanity for her, could you do it? If she asked you to forsake everybody you knew for herself would you be able to go through with it?"  
短暂的停顿后，伪明日香问道：“如果她真心请求你帮助她……你能做到吗？如果她要求你为她抛弃人性，你能做到吗？如果她要求你为她背弃所有你认识的人，你能狠下心去做吗？”

Shinji turned his head to look at the back of the Asuka that he knew. Sighing he said, "What relevance does that have. Why would she ask something like that in the first place."  
真嗣转头看向他熟悉的明日香背影。叹了口气，他说：“那有什么关系。她为什么要问这种问题。”

"Well, you can't deny that the first option is a possibility. The other two are more to explain my point."  
“好吧，你不能否认第一个选项是有可能的。后两个更多的是为了说明我的观点。”

"No...I suppose I can't."  
"不...我想我不能。"

"And? You haven't answered my question."  
"然后呢？你还没回答我的问题。"

"I'd like to hope I would. After what we've been through."  
"我希望能相信我会。经历了这么多之后。"

"Thats a rather easy way to avoid the answer."  
"那是个相当简单的逃避回答的方式。"

"Well excuse me for still not understanding what you're getting at."  
"好吧，原谅我还没弄明白你的意思。"

"Fine let me put it bluntly. If her entire world came crashing down on top of her, would you be able to stand under her and protect her from the falling pieces of everything that has happened to her?"  
"好吧，让我直截了当地说。如果她的整个世界轰然崩塌，你能否站在她身下，保护她免受那些坠落的一切碎片的伤害？"

"..."

"Well?" "那么？"

"...Yes..." "...是的..."

Springing up the pseudo Asuka grinned and said, "Glad to hear it. I'll hold you to that."  
伪装的明日香跳起来，咧嘴一笑说："很高兴听你这么说。我会记住你这句话的。"

The last thing that Shinji could remember before he drifted off to sleep was the pseudo Asuka smiling back at him and he suddenly wished that his Asuka would be able smile that serenely one day too.  
在昏昏欲睡之前，真嗣能记得的最后一件事是伪明日香对他微笑，他突然希望自己的明日香有一天也能那样宁静地微笑。

---

In almost no time at all the day that they were supposed to fight the angel again arrived. They had finally achieved a hundred percent the night before and Shinji was rather nervous as he tried to chew his cereal with a mouth that refused to work. Asuka seemed to be rather jittery also as she was tapping her index finger repeatedly on the table.  
几乎转眼间，他们再次与使徒战斗的日子就到了。前一晚他们终于达到了百分百同步率，真嗣紧张得试图用无法工作的嘴巴咀嚼麦片。明日香似乎也很紧张，她不停地用食指敲打着桌子。

After roughly an hour of nervous waiting, during which Shinji suggested they squeeze in some last minute practice at which Asuka just snarled at, the time arrived. Misato left a message on Asuka's phone letting them know that all preparation had been taken care of and that they were ready for them.  
在大约一个小时的紧张等待后，期间真嗣提议进行一些最后的练习，结果被明日香咆哮着拒绝了，时间到了。美里在明日香的手机上留言，告诉他们所有准备工作已经完成，他们已经准备就绪。

"Well lets go..." "好吧，我们走..."

Shinji just nodded silently. She must have been really nervous to not tack on her usual trade mark.  
真嗣只是默默地点了点头。她一定是真的很紧张，以至于没有加上她平常的标志性话语。

After a hasty drive to Nerv, Shinji and Asuka quickly dawned their plug suits and were listening to a rant that Ritsuko was giving about the anatomy of the angel that they were facing. Though Shinji wasn't quite listening.  
匆忙驱车到达 NERV 后，真嗣和明日香迅速穿上插入栓服，听着律子关于他们即将面对的天使解剖结构的训话。不过真嗣并没有怎么听。

When they had first entered Nerv earlier he was surprised to see Rei waiting for them. Without speaking to them she had escorted them to the command center and had so far been standing silently in the back round next to Misato, who was chewing on a finger nail. If Shinji had to honestly say it might be very well because of Rei that they had even achieved the hundred percent.  
当他们初次进入 Nerv 时，他惊讶地看到绫波在等他们。她没有和他们说话，而是带领他们来到指挥中心，至今一直静静地站在后方的 Misato 旁边，Misato 正在咬着指甲。如果真嗣要老实说，很可能正是因为绫波，他们才达到了百分百的成就。

True to his words, Kensuke had returned two days after the initial visit while dragging Touji along with him. Though instead of Hikari tagging along it was Rei, of which Kensuke and Touji didn't seem to keen on walking with. Shinji could only guess at the lack of conversation. Though one good thing did seem to come out of her visit. At her sudden appearance Asuka seemed to put on a spur of motivation and had seemed much keener on working together with Shinji then the usual yelling and abusing. Shinji attested this to the fact that Asuka always enjoyed showing her superiority, and didn't miss a change to prove she was better than Rei. While Rei wasn't the most social person he had ever meet Shinji had gotten used to her personality to borderline enjoying her company, even if it was silent.  
正如他所说，真希在初次访问后的两天回来了，同时拖着阿薰一起。虽然不是光跟着，而是绫波，真希和阿薰似乎不太愿意和她一起走。真嗣只能猜测是因为缺乏对话。不过，她的来访确实带来了一件好事。在她突然出现时，明日香似乎突然充满了动力，比平时更愿意与真嗣合作，而不是大喊大叫和辱骂。真嗣认为这是因为明日香总是喜欢展示自己的优越性，从不放过证明自己比绫波更优秀的机会。虽然绫波不是他见过的最社交化的人，但真嗣已经习惯了她的性格，甚至到了几乎享受她陪伴的地步，即使她是沉默的。

"Got that Asuka?" “明白了吗，明日香？”

"Yeah, yeah," said Asuka replying to Ritsuko's long winded explanation.  
“是是是，”明日香对律子冗长的解释回应道。

"Shinji, got it?" “真嗣，明白了吗？”

Shinji seemed to be dragged out of his revere and looked at her before mumbling, "Huh...oh, yeah." He couldn't remember a thing she had just said.  
真嗣似乎被从沉思中拉了出来，看着她，含糊地应道：“啊……哦，明白了。”他一点儿也不记得她刚才说了什么。

"If you understand then get in your Eva's and prepare for deployment," said a slightly disgruntled Misato.  
"如果你明白了，就进入你的 Eva，准备部署，" 米萨托有些不满地说道。

"What's her problem," asked Asuka?  
"她有什么问题，" 明日香问道？

Shrugging, Shinji followed her as the two prepared to enter their respected units.  
耸了耸肩，真嗣跟着她，两人准备进入各自的机体。

---

Even though they had trained rigorously they still had to adapt that training to be used while piloting Eva. They had therefore been repeatedly told that Eva was just like an extension of their own body. With this mind set they should be able to defeat the angel while it split separately. There was of course that slight roadblock that they always seemed to experience: There constant bickering with each other. Though Misato hoped that they could overcome if for at least a minute.  
尽管他们经过了严格的训练，但仍需将这些训练适应于驾驶 Eva 的过程中。因此，他们反复被告知，Eva 就像是他们身体的延伸。有了这种心态，他们应该能够在天使分裂时击败它。当然，总是有一个小小的障碍：他们之间的不断争吵。尽管 Misato 希望他们至少能克服这一点，哪怕只有一分钟。

After extensive trial and error they had finally come up with a way to defeat the angel. While seeming to be stronger while separated, Ritsuko had determined that the overall structure of the angels body was weaker than while one. This was due to the fact that the split originated after constant cells reproduction. Cells have a set limit that they are able to reproduce for and it seemed that an angel was no exception. It was still considered a living organism.  
经过反复试验和错误，他们终于找到了击败天使的方法。虽然分开时看似更强大，但 Ritsuko 确定天使的整体结构在合体时更为脆弱。这是因为分裂发生在细胞不断复制之后。细胞有其复制次数的限制，而天使也不例外。它仍然被视为一个活生生的有机体。

Therefore a plan was put into play to force the angel to become one again so its core could be destroyed all at once. By attacking the separated angels simultaneously within a gap of one minute it was hoped that it would become whole again.  
因此，制定了一个计划，迫使天使重新合体，以便一次性摧毁其核心。通过在一分钟的时间间隔内同时攻击分裂的天使，希望它能重新合体。

"I'm turning the music on you two and putting a silence on all radio's. I don't want any interference while we enact this," said Misato over the intercom.  
“我要对你们俩播放音乐，并让所有电台静音。在我们执行任务时，我不希望有任何干扰，”美里通过对讲机说道。

Shinji let out a sigh as he tried to loosen himself up a little. This was not a time to have tense nerves. He guessed that Asuka was doing something similar next to him.  
真嗣叹了口气，试图让自己放松一点。现在不是紧张的时候。他猜想明日香也在旁边做着类似的事情。

Once again he heard the familiar sound of the classical music that they had become accustomed to this last week. Even after listening to it almost every waking second of the past days he still enjoyed it.  
他又听到了那熟悉的古典音乐声，这是他们过去一周已经习惯的声音。尽管在过去的日子里几乎每时每刻都在听，他仍然喜欢它。

"Ba...Shinji? You ready?"  
"Ba...Shinji？准备好了吗？"

Shinji almost laugh as she caught herself before calling him an idiot. "Yeah, lets go."  
Shinji 差点笑出声，她及时阻止了自己叫他白痴。“嗯，走吧。”

Simultaneously the two Eva's stood up from their kneeling position next to the two elevator shafts and did a front flip over the two buildings in front of them. It was really quite comical to see two giant robots doing acrobatics.  
同时，两台 Eva 从跪坐在两个电梯井旁的位置站起，向前翻跃过它们面前的两栋建筑。看到两个巨型机器人做杂技动作，真是相当滑稽。

"Asuka do you-" "明日香，你——"

"Yeah I see the bastards!"  
"没错，我看到那些混蛋了！"

Far off on their monitor screen they could distinguish two small dots far off in the ocean, just starting to emerge out of the water. They had specific instruction to not engage the angel while it was still in the water. It would hinder their movements if they tried fighting in the water.  
在他们的监视屏幕上，可以看到远处海洋中有两个小点，刚刚开始从水中冒出来。他们接到的指令是在使徒还在水中时不要进行攻击。如果在水中战斗，会妨碍他们的行动。

After a hectic minute the separate angel finally brought its feet onto dry land.  
经过一番忙乱，那只独立的精灵终于将双脚踏上了干燥的陆地。

Without waiting for a sign from the other, both Eva's bolted towards the beach at break neck speed. It was really a marvel at how well they were working together now. Before if they had tried something so simplistic they would have ended up bashing against each others elbows. Now they ran in a direct line next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, neither getting ahead of the other.  
不等对方发出信号，伊娃们便以惊人的速度冲向海滩。现在她们合作得如此默契，真是令人惊叹。以前如果尝试这样简单的动作，她们肯定会互相撞到对方的肘部。现在她们并肩奔跑，肩并肩，谁也没有超过谁，沿着一条直线前进。

As they neared the beach they both turned, and in a wide arc circled around so that they were position to the far left and right of their respected angels. Kicking off against the sand, they both tore towards the angel they had chosen. Sensing danger the two angels jumped high into the air, creating a large dust storm in the air.  
当她们接近海滩时，两人同时转身，以一个大弧度绕行，分别位于各自精灵的左、右两侧。她们踢起沙子，向选定的精灵疾驰而去。感受到危险，两只精灵高高跃起，在空中掀起了一阵巨大的沙尘暴。

The two Eva's didn't halt their pace until they had arrived directly under the angel. Just before colliding into each other, the two jumped high into the air, higher then the two angels. Turning around in mid air the two Eva's brought both of their right legs back, and dropped them with a sickening crack on top of the angels heads.  
两位 Eva 并未停下脚步，直到她们直接抵达天使的下方。就在即将相撞的前一刻，她们高高跃起，超越了两名天使。在半空中转身，两位 Eva 将各自的右腿后撤，然后以令人毛骨悚然的碎裂声猛击在天使的头顶。

Flying back towards the ground the separate angels repositioned themselves and landed with a thud on the soft sand.  
分开的两位天使飞回地面，重新调整位置，重重地落在柔软的沙地上，发出一声闷响。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

Without having to think Shinji directed Unit 01's hand towards Unit 02. The two hands grasped each other and they both rocketed towards the ground.  
无需多想，真嗣指挥初号机将手伸向二号机。两只手紧紧相握，她们一同向地面疾驰而去。

Using the momentum that they had gained as the soared towards the ground, the two Eva's dug their feet into the sand. With hands still clasped, they placed them on the sand, palms directed downward and kicked outwards. The kicking was however met by a stronger AT-field from the combined efforts of the angels and their kick was forcefully blocked.  
借助向地面俯冲的势头，两台 EVA 将脚深深插入沙中。双手依旧紧握，他们将手掌朝下放在沙地上，然后向外踢出。然而，这一踢却被天使们合力形成的更强大的 AT 力场强行阻挡。

Breaking off the AT-field the two angels lashed out with their clawed hands trying to slash into the armor of the two Eva's. Flipping backwards the two Eva's were easily able to dodge the oncoming attack.  
两台 EVA 打破 AT 力场，天使们伸出利爪试图撕裂 EVA 的装甲。EVA 们向后翻滚，轻松躲过了迎面而来的攻击。

"Damn it! How the hell are we supposed to defeat them if they use their AT-field like that!"  
“该死！如果他们那样使用 AT 力场，我们到底该怎么打败他们！”

"Calm down Asuka." “冷静点，明日香。”

She surprisingly relented and asked, "You got any ideas?"  
她出乎意料地让步了，问道：“你有什么主意吗？”

"Maybe...I mean, its worth a try I suppose."  
“或许吧...我是说，这值得一试，我想。”

"Fine! Direct me!" "好吧！给我指路！"

Shinji was rather taken aback at her willingness to listen to him but quickly told her what he wanted her to do. She didn't particularly like the idea, but she had to admit that it could work.  
真嗣对她的愿意听从感到相当意外，但他很快告诉了她希望她做的事情。她对这个主意并不特别喜欢，但她不得不承认这可能行得通。

"Fine I got it," said Asuka as she quickly position herself in front of her angel.  
"好吧，我明白了，" 明日香说着，迅速站到了她的使徒面前。

Glancing at the time limit they had left Shinji was startled that they had a little over a minute before the five minutes since the umbilical cord had been detached.  
瞥了一眼剩余的时间限制，真嗣惊讶地发现他们只剩下不到一分钟的时间，自从脐带电缆被断开已经过去了五分钟。

Again, without any means of signaling, the two Eva's dashed forward again toward their respected angels, which Shinji had noticed had been hovering close to each other. If he had guessed correctly they would solely rely on defense until they found an opening to attack. After the first attack they had ushered in, the angels had stuck close to each other so to protect each other.  
再次，由于没有任何信号手段，两台 EVA 再次向各自的目标天使冲去，真嗣注意到这些天使已经彼此靠近悬浮。如果他猜得没错，它们将完全依靠防御，直到找到攻击的空隙。自从第一次攻击后，天使们就一直紧靠在一起，以保护彼此。

It seemed Shinji's theory was correct. As the two Eva's neared their targets the angels generated an AT-field larger than the last one. However, simultaneously, the two Eva's generated their own AT-field to counteract the angels AT-field.  
看来真嗣的理论是正确的。当两台 EVA 接近目标时，天使们生成了一个比上次更大的 AT 力场。然而，与此同时，两台 EVA 也生成了自己的 AT 力场来抵消天使的 AT 力场。

During the fight against Ramiel, Shinji had learned something about AT-fields. A large key to the power of an AT-field was emotions. He had remembered that he wanted to defeat the angel no matter what and had generated that large AT-field and ripped apart the flesh of the angel. He had hoped that the same could be applied to this. It seemed like he was right.  
在与雷米尔的战斗中，真嗣对 AT 力场有了新的认识。AT 力场的强大关键在于情感。他记得自己无论如何都要击败天使，于是生成了强大的 AT 力场，撕裂了天使的肉体。他希望同样的原理也能应用于此。看来他是对的。

He had told Asuka about his hunch, though not specifically saying why he thought that. She agreed that they could give it a shot. So Shinji had told Asuka to think of nothing other than defeating the angel.  
他向明日香透露了自己的直觉，但没有具体说明为什么这么想。她同意可以一试。于是真嗣告诉明日香，除了击败天使之外，什么都不要想。

He wasn't sure if the same mentality could be applied to an angel. Certainly an angel was a living organism, in the sense that it had flesh and organs. But did it have emotions? Could an angel relish in victory or stew in defeat? Did an angel even have a sense of existence?  
他不确定同样的思维方式是否适用于天使。当然，从拥有肉体和器官的角度来看，天使是生物。但它有情感吗？天使会享受胜利或沉浸在失败中吗？天使甚至有存在的意识吗？

Throwing away his hesitancy he projected all his thoughts into defeating what was directly in front of him. Next to him he could feel that Asuka was doing the same thing, and that their wishes and desires were starting to overlap. It was then that Shinji felt the separate AT-fields become one. He supposed that something had actually come out of going to school dressed in that horrendous outfit.  
他抛开犹豫，将所有思绪集中在击败眼前的敌人上。他能感觉到身旁的明日香也在做同样的事，他们的愿望和渴望开始重叠。就在那时，真嗣感觉到各自的 AT 力场合而为一。他想，穿上那套可怕的校服去上学，总算还是有所收获。

Slowly the angel was pushed backwards as the AT-field grew and the angels feet started sliding across the sand. Shinji finally saw a large crack happening in the angels AT-field and next second it shattered.  
随着 AT 力场的增强，天使缓缓后退，双脚开始在沙地上滑动。真嗣终于看到天使的 AT 力场出现了一道巨大的裂缝，下一秒便彻底破碎。

Without even hesitating, Asuka and Shinji followed up the shattering of the AT-field with a quick spin kick to the chest. The separate angels stumbled backwards and was about to produce another AT-field. Though Shinji didn't give them a chance.  
毫不犹豫地，明日香和真嗣在 AT 力场破碎后迅速跟进，对准胸口施以旋转踢击。两个天使踉跄后退，正要再次生成 AT 力场。但真嗣没有给他们机会。

Dropping down low he swung his Eva's legs out knocking the angel off his feet. Meanwhile, as Shinji had ducked down, Asuka had jumped over him and with a sickening crunch, drove her Eva's balled up fist into the side of the angels head.  
他俯身一跃，用 Eva 的双腿将天使击倒在地。与此同时，真嗣蹲下之际，明日香从他头顶跃过，伴随着一声令人毛骨悚然的碎裂声，她用 Eva 紧握的拳头猛击天使的头部侧面。

While still on the ground Shinji grabbed onto Asuka's Eva's arm and spun her like a ballerina backwards as the fallen angel next to the one she had decked tried to get retribution. With its failed attack Shinji quickly grabbed its outstretched arm and bent it backwards. Over the sound of the bone snapping a loud roar could be heard escaping the angels lopsided mouth. The shock wave sent Unit 01 skidding backwards across the sand, though Shinji felt himself stop suddenly as Unit 02 grabbed his Eva's shoulders and held him steady.  
真嗣仍躺在地上，抓住明日香 Eva 的手臂，像芭蕾舞者一样将她向后旋转，而旁边被击倒的天使试图报复。在它攻击失败后，真嗣迅速抓住其伸出的手臂并反向弯曲。随着骨头断裂的声音，一声巨吼从天使歪斜的口中传出。冲击波使初号机在沙地上滑行后退，但真嗣感到自己突然停了下来，因为二号机抓住了他的 Eva 的肩膀，稳住了他。

"Thanks, Asuka." “谢谢你，明日香。”

"No problem." "没问题。"

Shinji ended up smiling even though he knew that Asuka hadn't seen. Next second though his smile turned to a frown as he saw what the angel was doing. Apparently it had finally given up the split and was starting to become one gain."  
尽管知道明日香没看见，真嗣还是不由自主地笑了。但下一秒，他的笑容就变成了皱眉，因为他看到了使徒在做什么。显然，它终于放弃了分裂，开始重新合为一体。

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

"Tch. Finally." "啧，终于。"

Shinji watched as the sides that had fused together seemed to slide off as tendons and nerves were dislocated from the main part of the body. It was like watching one side of a wall that had wet paint and one that was dry. The wet side was dripping while the dry side stayed firm.  
真嗣看着那些原本融合在一起的部分，仿佛随着肌腱和神经从主体分离而滑落。就像一面墙，一边是湿漉漉的油漆，另一边已经干透。湿的那边在滴落，而干的那边依然坚固。

Large pieces of flesh started to fall off and instantly turned black and started to break apart and decompose on the sands of the beach. Putrid black blood leaked out of the half organs that were left to rot in the sun. The beaches sands turned black as blood flowed out of the new open wounds in the side of the angel. The smell of rot entered Shinji's nose and he start gagging slightly.  
大块的肉开始脱落，瞬间变黑，开始破碎并分解在沙滩上。腐臭的黑血从残留的半个器官中流出，在阳光下腐烂。沙滩的沙子因血液从天使侧面的新伤口流出而变黑。腐烂的气味钻入真嗣的鼻孔，他开始微微作呕。

"Uh, smells terrible," said a raspy Asuka who had her nostrils pierced together by her thumb and index finger.  
“呃，臭死了。”明日香沙哑地说道，她的拇指和食指穿过鼻孔紧紧捏在一起。

'Thats an understatement,' thought Shinji.  
“这还只是轻描淡写。”真嗣心想。

Then something that truly sent Shinji and Asuka into fits of nauseous upheaval happened. Large strands of nerves and tendons shot out from both of the angels sides and wrapped around each other. With feeling rekindled in the body the separate bodies were able to stand up and it seemed that the connected flesh was starting to reel in the separate pieces.  
随后，真正让真嗣和明日香感到极度恶心的事情发生了。从两个使徒的两侧射出大量神经和肌腱，相互缠绕。随着身体感觉的恢复，分离的身体能够站立起来，似乎连接的肉体开始将分离的部分拉回。

"Thats disgusting," muttered Asuka.  
“真恶心。”明日香嘀咕道。

Shinji agreed with her nonchalantly.  
真嗣不以为意地同意了她的看法。

As the two bodies became one again the flesh bubbled over the recently closed wound and turned smooth as though it had never separated.  
随着两具身体再次合二为一，新近闭合的伤口处的肉体冒起了泡，变得光滑如初，仿佛从未分离过。

Without any change in demeanor the angel quickly regained its pace and charged at Unit 01. Without thinking, Shinji created a quick AT-field that was easily smashed as the angels fist tore through it.  
天使的神情未变，迅速恢复了速度，向初号机冲来。下意识地，真嗣迅速展开了 AT 力场，却被天使的拳头轻易击穿。

"Shit!" "该死！"

Doing a flip backwards Shinji landed next to Asuka in Unit 02.  
真嗣一个后空翻，落在了二号机旁的地上。

"We got it to join, but now what?"  
“我们让它加入了，但接下来怎么办？”

"I thought you had a plan after the last one!"  
"我以为上次之后你会有个计划！"

Shinji didn't want to remind Asuka that this wasn't a time to fight and remained silent.  
真嗣不想提醒明日香这不是争斗的时候，于是保持沉默。

"Well if your not going to do anything, I'll go first."  
"好吧，如果你什么都不打算做，那我就先上了。"

Before Shinji could argue that it was better to work together, Unit 02 kicked off against the sand and put on a burst of speed towards the angel. Quickly ducking the blow that was intended for its face, the angel delivered a brutal uppercut to Unit 02's jaw.  
在真嗣能辩驳说合作更好之前，二号机蹬开沙子，加速冲向使徒。迅速低头躲过本应击中其面部的攻击，使徒对二号机的下巴施以一记残酷的上勾拳。

Shinji winced slightly as he heard Asuka groan in pain, but really, it was her fault for being so rash.  
听到明日香痛苦的呻吟，真嗣微微皱眉，但说真的，她这么鲁莽是自找的。

"If you're done fooling around, I've got another idea."  
“如果你闹够了，我还有另一个主意。”

"Well aren't you being useful for once."  
"哎呀，你这次倒是派上用场了。"

Shinji ignored her spiteful retort and said, "Its quite simple since we out number him now."  
真嗣无视她的尖刻反驳，说道：“这很简单，因为我们现在人数上占优势。”

"...Fine...I'm listening."  
"……好吧……我在听。"

After a hasty reply on what he intended her to do she simply sighed and said, "Fine I'll be the bait."  
在匆忙回复了他打算让她做什么之后，她只是叹了口气说：“好吧，我来当诱饵。”

"No...I'll do it!" “不……我来！”

It took less than a second for Asuka to reply, "Eh?"  
不到一秒钟，明日香就回应道：“诶？”

"It'd be better if I do it."  
"还是我来比较好。"

"Hmmm? Well aren't you acting gallantly all the sudden."  
"嗯？怎么突然这么英勇了。"

"...I'd just prefer it if I did."  
"...我只是更希望自己来做。"

"Fine just move! We don't have much time!" Screamed Asuka as she watched time ticking away for their remaining energy.  
“快点动起来！我们没多少时间了！”明日香尖叫着，眼看着剩余能量一点点流逝。

Shinji had started moving before she finished her sentence.  
真嗣在她话音未落时就已经开始行动了。

Appearing in front of the angel, he swung out but was quickly met with a strong AT-field. Shinji had no time to worry about breaking it and quickly spun around the side of the angel and attempted to elbow it in the side, but was met with another strong AT-field. This time spinning around towards it back, he reached in the shoulder holster on Unit 01 and swiftly wiped out the progressive knife. Stabbing in a backwards motion it was met with thin air as the angel had done a back flip and was not hovering above Unit 01.  
他出现在使徒面前，挥拳出击，却立刻遭遇了强大的 AT 力场。真嗣无暇顾及如何打破它，迅速绕到使徒侧面，试图用肘击其侧身，却又被另一道强大的 AT 力场挡住。这次他转向使徒背后，伸手从初号机的肩部枪套中迅速抽出高频振动刀。反手一刺，却扑了个空，原来使徒已经后空翻，悬浮在初号机上方。

Shinji quickly rolled out of the way as an AT-field attempted to enclose him and slowly crush him to death. Standing back up he was greeted by the angel as it dove down towards the ground with its legs outstretched, intending to kick Unit 01 in the chest. Shinji quickly ducked underneath as the kick barely missed the side of Unit 01's head. Simultaneously he swung in an arc above his head with the progressive knife, slicing into the angels thigh as it passed over him.  
真嗣迅速滚向一旁，躲避着试图包围并慢慢将他压碎的 AT 力场。站起身来，他迎面遭遇了天使，它双腿伸直俯冲向地面，意图用脚踢击初号机的胸膛。真嗣迅速低头躲闪，这一脚险些擦过初号机的头部侧面。同时，他挥动高振动粒子刀在头顶上方划出一道弧线，刀刃切入天使的大腿，在其掠过他时造成了伤害。

Doing several cart wheels backwards he noticed that he was at the edge of the beach were it connected with the ocean.  
他连续后空翻了几下，注意到自己已经到了沙滩与海洋的交界处。

Breathing in a weary sort of way he wiped some sweat off his brow and he charged in again. As he neared the angel he swung the progressive knife wildly towards where he suspected the core was. Normally the angel would have generated an AT-field this time to prevent another wound, though Asuka hadn't permitted that.  
他以一种疲惫的方式喘息着，擦去额头的汗水，再次发起冲锋。接近天使时，他疯狂地挥舞高振动粒子刀，朝他猜测的核心位置砍去。通常情况下，天使此时会生成 AT 力场来防止再次受伤，但明日香并未允许这种情况发生。

While Shinji had been occupying the angel, Asuka had been patiently waiting for an opening to attack in a swift fashion. Shinji had wanted her to do this part largely because she had more experience with actual combat then he did. She had been in more combat situations and training and was able to read a situation like this better then him.  
当真嗣牵制住使徒时，明日香耐心地等待着攻击的时机，准备以迅雷不及掩耳之势出击。真嗣希望她来完成这一部分，主要是因为她在实战方面的经验比他丰富。她经历过更多的战斗和训练，能够比他更好地判断这样的局势。

So before the angel was able to generate an AT-field, Asuka appeared from above and drove her own progressive knife directly into the skull of the angel, preventing any nerves from communicating for a brief moment. It was in that moment that Shinji dug his progressive knife into the stomach of the angel. Grabbing the handle with both hands, Unit 01 dug the knife in further and with a quick thrust, slashed upwards, cutting the abdominal cavity in two in the process.  
所以在使徒能够生成 AT 力场之前，明日香从上方现身，将她的高频振动刀直接刺入使徒的头颅，阻止了神经信号的传递片刻。就在这一瞬间，真嗣将他的高频振动刀插入了使徒的腹部。双手紧握刀柄，初号机将刀深入，随即迅速上挑，将腹腔一分为二。

Blood and organs cascaded out and onto the ground as the angel started writhing around, shaking Asuka off as it started unleashing its fury.  
血液和内脏如瀑布般倾泻而出，使徒开始剧烈扭动，将明日香甩开，并发泄着它的狂怒。

Before it was able to start regenerate though Shinji noticed something that had fallen out of the abdominal cavity and without a second though pierced it with his progressive knife.  
然而，在它开始再生之前，真嗣注意到有什么东西从腹部腔体中掉了出来，他毫不犹豫地用他的高频刀刺穿了它。

What was left of the angel exploded suddenly in a viscous red haze that splattered blood in a one kilometer radius. Shinji looked at what was left of the carcass of the angel was throughly glad that he didn't have to take any part in the cleanup.  
天使残余的部分突然爆炸，形成了一片粘稠的红色雾霾，血迹溅射到了一公里的范围内。真嗣看着天使残骸的遗留物，庆幸自己不必参与清理工作。

Breathing out a sigh of relief he glanced over at Asuka and said, "Nice job."  
他松了一口气，瞥向明日香，说道：“干得漂亮。”

"What would you expect from the best."  
"你还能期待最好的什么呢。"

'Maybe a little quicker next time,' thought Shinji.  
'也许下次能再快一点，'真嗣心想。

Suddenly Misato's face appeared on the monitor at his side with a beaming smile on her face.  
突然，美里带着灿烂的笑容出现在他旁边的显示器上。

"Great job you two, really great. I suppose that the training paid off."  
"你们俩干得真棒，确实很棒。我想那次训练还是值得的。"

"Please don't ever mention that training again for as long as I live," shuddered Asuka.  
"求你这辈子都别再提那次训练了，"明日香颤抖着说。

Shinji just laugh. In the end it hadn't been all that bad.  
真嗣只是笑了笑。毕竟，最后也没那么糟糕。

"Oh, I know. As to celebrate I'll take you two out to eat. And to be fair I'll ask Rei to come along."  
"哦，我知道了。为了庆祝，我带你们俩出去吃饭。为了公平起见，我会叫丽一起来的。"

Asuka's mood suddenly turned sour. "Food does sound good, but why does the first child have to tag along?"  
明日香的心情突然变差了。“吃饭听起来不错，但为什么第一适格者非得跟着来？”

"Why couldn't she," mumbled Shinji?  
“她为什么不能来，”真嗣小声嘀咕道？

Asuka's face suddenly appeared on the monitor directly in front of him and she looked like she was about to exploded.  
明日香的脸突然出现在他正前方的屏幕上，看起来她快要爆炸了。

"PERVERTED BAKA! YOU JUST WANT TO HEAR HER PRAISE YOU!"  
"变态笨蛋！你只是想听她夸你吧！"

"Ah...is Asuka a little jealous," smirked Misato.  
"啊...明日香是不是有点吃醋了，"美里微微一笑。

"WHAAAAAAAAAAT!" "哇啊啊啊啊啊！"

"Calm down Asuka. I ment it as a joke."  
"冷静点，明日香。我只是在开玩笑。"

"Tch!" "切！"

"Well, anyway...get back here and let the hazard team start cleanup. It could take a while..."  
"总之...回来吧，让危险应对小组开始清理。这可能需要一段时间..."

"Hai," said both Shinji and Asuka simultaneously.  
"是," 真嗣和明日香同时说道。

---

In the end Misato had taken them all out for ramen. Asuka had been outraged that her effort was equal to about one bowl of ramen. Not to mention that Rei had joined them which only improved her mood. And now Shinji had to deal with that mood as they returned home.  
最终，美里带他们所有人去吃了拉面。明日香对于她的努力只值一碗拉面感到愤怒。更不用说丽也加入了他们，这让她的心情更加糟糕。现在，真嗣不得不在他们回家时应对她的情绪。

Asuka swung the door open hard and it banged off the wall. There had already been several large dents accumulated since she moved in and this only added to them.  
明日香用力推开门，门重重地撞在墙上。自从她搬进来后，门上已经积累了好几个大凹痕，这次又添了一笔。

"Do you have to do that every time you get in a bad mood?"  
“每次心情不好都要这样吗？”

Asuka slowly turned her head towards Shinji who was frowning at the door and said in a quiet voice, "What was that?"  
明日香缓缓转头看向皱着眉头的真嗣，轻声问道：“你说什么？”

"...Never mind. It doesn't really matter."  
"...没关系。其实也没那么重要。"

"Good." "很好。"

Trudging over to the living room she quickly seated herself on the sofa and flipped the T.V. Shinji was about to do likewise though when she hollered at him.  
她拖着沉重的步伐走到客厅，迅速坐在沙发上，打开了电视。真嗣正要照做，却被她大声叫住了。

"Hey, get me a bag of chips and a soda."  
"嘿，给我拿包薯片和一瓶汽水。"

"Why should I?" "凭什么我得去？"

"Because I said so. Now move it!"  
"因为我说的。快去！"

Shinji grumbled and in the end gave in to her wishes. It seemed that nothing had changed.  
真嗣嘟囔着，最终还是顺从了她的意愿。似乎一切都没有改变。

After rummaging around in the fridge and cupboard for the items she requested he walked back in the living room and deposited the chips on her chest put the cold drink next to her face. She seemed to jump slightly at the cold that was touching her face and glared at him for his annoying action. Swiping the bag of chips off her chest she popped them open and starting eating them by the handful.  
在冰箱和橱柜里翻找了一番，找到了她要的东西后，他走回客厅，把薯片放在她胸口，将冷饮贴在她脸旁。她似乎被脸上的冰冷吓了一跳，瞪了他一眼，怪他这烦人的举动。她一把抓过胸口的薯片袋，打开后大口大口地吃了起来。

Shinji sighed and thought, 'Back to the usual Asuka.'  
真嗣叹了口气，心想：'又是平常的明日香。'

Turning around he was about to got crash in his room when he heard her mumble through a mouthful of chips.  
他转过身，正要冲进自己的房间，却听到她嘴里塞满薯片含糊地咕哝着。

"Ba...Shinji?" “八...真嗣？”

"Huh?" “啊？”

Turning around, Shinji just saw her take a large gulp and downed half the soda. Setting it down she wiped her hands on the sofa getting rid of the crumbs from the chips.  
转过身，真嗣只看到她猛地喝了一大口，半瓶汽水就下肚了。放下瓶子，她用手在沙发上抹了抹，去掉薯片留下的碎屑。

"You...I mean...not that it means much but...thanks, for your help."  
“你……我是说……虽然这不算什么大事，但是……谢谢你的帮助。”

Shinji scratched the back of his head confusedly wondering what had happened with this sudden mood change.  
真嗣困惑地挠了挠后脑勺，不明白这突如其来的情绪变化是怎么回事。

"Erm, well, thanks." "呃，嗯，谢谢。"

Asuka sat up then and frowned at Shinji before saying. "By the way...why were you looking so keenly at the stupid first child while at the ramen shop?"  
明日香坐起身来，皱着眉头看向真嗣，然后问道：“顺便问一下……为什么你在拉面店里那么专注地盯着那个愚蠢的第一适格者？”

"Huh? Was I?" "啊？我有吗？"

Asuka's eyes seemed to flash crimson like a demons. "Your perverted eyes were all over her."  
明日香的眼中仿佛闪烁着恶魔般的猩红。“你那猥琐的目光一直在她身上游走。”

"I really have no idea what your talking about."  
“我真不知道你在说什么。”

"Go ahead and feign stupidity. Pervert!"  
“继续装傻吧。变态！”

Shinji was at a loss of how the conversation had gone from somewhat friendly, to this.  
真嗣完全不知道这场对话是如何从还算友好的氛围变成这样的。

"Well, if thats what you think, I guess it doesn't really matter. I know I wasn't doing that."  
“好吧，如果你这么认为，我想确实无关紧要。我知道我不是那样做的。”

"Doesn't real-Were you born stupid?"  
“难道不是真的——你天生就这么蠢吗？”

Shinji was about to retort back at her that she was completely overreacting and that he had never even thought of looking at Rei when the door bell rung.  
真嗣正要反驳她，说她完全反应过度，他从未想过要去看绫波，这时门铃响了。

Asuka and Shinji both turned their heads towards the sound.  
明日香和真嗣都转向声音的方向。

"Did you lock the door after you walked in," asked Asuka?  
“你进来后锁门了吗？”明日香问道。

"No...I don't think so." "不...我觉得不是。"

"Can't understand why Misato would ring the door bell then."  
"真搞不懂美里为什么会按门铃。"

Shinji and Asuka looked at each other, hoping that the other would get up and find out. Then-  
真嗣和明日香互相对视，希望对方能起身去看看。然后——

"Fine I'll check." "好吧，我去看看。"

"Good." "很好。"

Shrugging as though he didn't care either way Shinji slowly got up, walked out of the living room, and into the hallway. After stopping in front of the door he suddenly wished they had one of those peep holes so he could find out who it was without opening it. Though he supposed he didn't have much choice. Maybe Misato had gotten too drunk and couldn't remember how to open doors.  
仿佛无所谓一般耸了耸肩，真嗣缓缓起身，走出客厅，进入走廊。在门前停下时，他突然希望他们有个猫眼，这样他就能在不打开门的情况下知道来者是谁。不过他想自己也没太多选择。或许是美里喝得太醉，连开门都不会了。

Swinging it open he mumbled without looking first.  
他没先看一眼就推开门，嘴里咕哝着。

"Yes?" "是的？"

What answered him was not something that he had been expecting. The voice was that of somebody in their late thirties or early forties. Certainly somebody Shinji didn't know. What's more the voice was that of a man.  
回应他的并非他所预料之物。那声音属于一个三十多岁或四十出头的人，显然是真嗣不认识的人。更重要的是，那是一个男人的声音。

"Is this the home of Misato Katsuragi?"  
“这里是葛城美里小姐的家吗？”

"Uh-huh." Shinji didn't know what to do in situations like this. Was this some guy that Misato had dated once?  
"嗯哼。" 真嗣在这种情境下不知该如何是好。这难道是美里曾经交往过的某个人吗？

"I see," he replied in a strong male voice. 'Almost sounds like somebody that works in real estate,' Shinji thought.  
"我明白了，"他用浑厚的男声回答。'听起来像是做房地产的，' 真嗣暗想。

"Then is there somebody named Asuka Langely Soryu living here?"  
"那么，这里是否住着一位名叫惣流·明日香·兰格雷的小姐？"

Shinji had to do a double take. How the heck did this guy know Asuka?  
真嗣不得不再次确认。这家伙到底是怎么认识明日香的？

Replying in an offhanded way he said, "Erm, well, yeah."  
他随口答道：“呃，嗯，是的。”

"Could you tell her that I'd like to talk to her."  
“你能告诉她我想和她谈谈吗？”

Shinji hesitated slightly and glanced at the guy. Now that he had gotten a good look at him he noticed that he had a well mannered face and seemed to be dressed in a pair of slacks and a Hawaiian button up tee-shirt. He seemed to be good natured enough and so Shinji mumbled, "Yeah, hang on, I'll call her."  
真嗣稍微犹豫了一下，瞥了那人一眼。现在仔细一看，他注意到那人有一张彬彬有礼的脸，穿着一条休闲裤和一件夏威夷风格的扣领 T 恤。他看起来性情温和，于是真嗣咕哝道：“嗯，等一下，我叫她。”

Looking over his shoulder he hollered just like she had done earlier.  
他回头望去，就像她之前那样大声喊道。

"Oi, Asuka!" “喂，明日香！”

"What, damn it!" "什么，该死！"

"Somebody at the door wants to talk to you."  
"门口有人想跟你谈谈。"

"Huh? To me?" "啊？找我？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"Heh, most be another idiot wanting to invite me to their college. I can't count the idiots I've yelled at since I got here."  
"哼，多半又是哪个白痴想邀请我去他们大学。自从来到这里，我已经不知道对多少白痴吼过了。"

"I don't think its exactly like that," said Shinji as he heard Asuka sliding off the couch.  
""我觉得情况未必如此，"" 真嗣说道，他听到明日香从沙发上滑下来的声音。

"Whatever. I'll find out for myself."  
"管他呢。我自己会弄清楚的。"

Shinji would never forget the look on Asuka's grimacing face as she poked it out of the living room to get a glimpse of who the person was. Shinji did not believe that it was a face that Asuka was even capable of making. Now though her expression would forever be etched in his mind as her grimacing face slowly turned from one of surprise, to absolute loathing, then, to scared and afraid. It was this last expression that Shinji had never expected to see on her face. It was unheard of for Asuka to become afraid.  
真嗣永远不会忘记明日香那扭曲的面孔，当她从客厅探出头来，试图一窥来者是谁时的表情。真嗣不相信明日香能做出那样的表情。但现在，她的表情将永远烙印在他的记忆中，那扭曲的面孔从惊讶逐渐转变为绝对的厌恶，然后，变得恐惧和害怕。正是这最后的表情，真嗣从未预料到会在她脸上看到。明日香变得害怕，这是前所未闻的。

Slowly, Shinji saw her open and close her mouth pitifully and saw that she seemed to shrink from where she stood. Her hands slowly formed at her chest and slowly wrapped themselves around her body as though she was trying to protect herself from the stranger. Her legs became wobbly and Shinji firmly believed that she would have collapsed if he hadn't quickly rushed over to support her.  
慢慢地，真嗣看到她可怜地张合着嘴巴，似乎从站立的地方缩了回去。她的双手缓缓地在胸前合拢，慢慢环绕着自己的身体，仿佛试图从陌生人那里保护自己。她的双腿变得摇摇晃晃，真嗣坚信，如果不是他迅速冲过去扶住她，她早就倒下了。

Holding a steady hand on her shoulder he took a good look at her face and saw that tears had formed at the corners of her eyes and were threatening to spill forth. Shinji opened his mouth slightly but quickly closed it. Slowly, his gaze shifted towards the stranger who had not budged since he had rang the door bell.  
他稳稳地把手搭在她的肩上，仔细端详着她的脸，发现眼角已经积满了泪水，眼看就要夺眶而出。真嗣微微张开嘴，却又迅速闭上了。慢慢地，他的目光转向了那位自按响门铃后就一直未曾动弹的陌生人。

"I'm back, Asuka..." “我回来了，明日香……”

Shinji looked quickly back at Asuka who's tears had finally spilled forth, reflecting sealed memories and the fear that she had lived with to this day.  
真嗣迅速回头看向明日香，她的泪水终于滑落，映照出封存的记忆和她至今所承受的恐惧。

As Shinji heard the single word she uttered, he felt a strong hatred that he had never felt in his life. Stronger than his hatred for his own father. A hatred that could only be directed at one person.  
当真嗣听到她吐出的那个字时，他感受到了一种前所未有的强烈憎恨。比他对亲生父亲的恨意还要强烈。这种恨意只能指向一个人。

"Fa-Father?"  “父、父亲？”

**Got this done a lot sooner than I expected. As usual I end up changing stuff here and there to change the story to something more...original I guess is the correct word. With regards to the anatomy of the angel...its something that I was always curious about. Also I was curious about how they generated an AT-field. So with regards to that I decided to throw in the fact that they function just like a human, in that they have a brain and send signals throughout the body. Which explains why when Asuka stabbed directly into the brain of the angel it was briefly...unconscious I suppose is what you could call it.  
完成得比预期早得多。一如既往，我最终还是在这里那里改动了一些东西，把故事改得更...原创一些，我想这个词是恰当的。关于使徒的解剖结构...我一直很好奇。还有它们是如何产生 AT 力场的。因此，关于这一点，我决定加入它们像人类一样运作的事实，即它们有大脑并通过身体发送信号。这也解释了为什么当明日香直接刺入使徒的大脑时，它会短暂地...失去意识，我想你可以这么称呼它。**

**On another note how did you like the cliffhanger? Was it expected? I had planned on including Asuka's father to show up later and in a different scenario...but I decided to do something different for that specific scenario. Anyways this is long winded and what not so I'm gonna stop now.  
换个话题，你觉得那个悬念怎么样？是意料之中的吗？我原本计划让明日香的爸爸在后面某个不同的情节中出现...但我决定为那个特定情节做些不同的安排。总之，这些话有点冗长，所以我现在就打住。**

### Chapter 9: Relapse
第九章：复发  

**As you can tell this is a much longer chapter than I've ever done before. Large reason for this is because I'm going back to college in three days so I won't have as much time to work on this as I'd like. So hopefully this will make due for now. I had thought about splitting it up also, but in the end decided to go with what you see here.  
如你所见，这一章比以往任何一章都要长。主要原因是三天后我就要回大学了，所以没有那么多时间来写这个故事。希望这一章能暂时弥补一下。我也曾考虑过把它分成几部分，但最终还是决定按照现在的样子呈现。**

"Fa-Father?" “父、父亲？”

Shinji felt Asuka shiver uncontrollably at her own words, as though she had just gotten out of a walk in freezer. With his gaze still fixed on Asuka he watched silently as the tears continued to fall off her chin while a boiling hatred was erupting inside of him. If he were to take one step forward he knew he wouldn't be able to stop himself and probably end of killing the man. He would have deserved it too. Instead though-  
真嗣感觉到明日香的话让她自己不由自主地颤抖，仿佛刚从冷藏室走出来一样。他的目光依旧紧盯着明日香，默默地看着泪水继续从她的下巴滴落，而他的内心却涌动着沸腾的仇恨。如果他向前迈出一步，他知道自己将无法控制自己，很可能会杀了那个人。他也确实该死。然而——

"Asuka...is it really you? You look just like your mother," whispered her father.  
“明日香...真的是你吗？你看起来和你母亲一模一样，”她的父亲低声说道。

Shinji's eyes flew towards him. How dare that bastard even acknowledge that he recognized her this many years later! How dare that asshole mention the similarities between her and her mother! How dare that whore mongering piece of shit even be breathing the same air as Asuka!  
真嗣的目光猛地转向他。那个混蛋怎么敢这么多年后还敢承认他认出了她！那个混蛋怎么敢提及她和母亲的相似之处！那个嫖娼的垃圾怎么敢和明日香呼吸同样的空气！

Asuka's father seemed to notice that he was giving him a death glare that could melt the armor right off of Eva and seemed to hesitate before stammering.  
明日香的父亲似乎注意到了他投来的足以融化 EVA 装甲的死亡凝视，似乎犹豫了一下，然后结结巴巴地说道。

"A-A-Asuka...is that you? It is isn't it? Please...I-I wanted to see you. I wanted to see my only daughter."  
“A-A-Asuka...是你吗？真的是你吧？求求你...我-我想见你。我想见我唯一的女儿。”

It was at that moment that Shinji exploded, letting forth the pent up anger. He wanted to talk with the daughter that he had tossed aside? He wanted to act like everything had never happened and they could start over entirely from scratch? Shinji couldn't let that happen even if he was reborn as a dog. He'd tear this fucker's leg off before letting him get close to Asuka.  
就在那一刻，真嗣爆发了，释放出积压已久的愤怒。他想和被他抛弃的女儿谈谈？他想装作一切都没发生过，从头开始？真嗣就算重生为狗，也不会让这家伙靠近明日香。他宁愿撕掉这混蛋的腿，也不让他接近明日香。

Just as her father took a hesitant step forward, Shinji took an assertive step forward and placed himself directly in front of Asuka, blocking his view. He wanted to make his action extremely clear and without a doubt in the man's mind standing in front of him.  
就在她父亲犹豫着迈出一步时，真嗣果断地向前一步，直接站在明日香前面，挡住了他的视线。他想让他的行动非常明确，让站在他面前的男人毫无疑问。

"Asuka does not want to talk to you," he said in as calm a voice he could muster. In truth he felt like ripping the guys throat out.  
"明日香不想和你说话，"他用尽可能平静的声音说道。实际上，他感觉自己想撕裂那家伙的喉咙。

The air was so tense that you would have had to cut it with a chainsaw. While stammering over his words, Asuka's father said, "But...I-I I thought you just said...that it'd...b-be okay if we...ta-talked?"  
空气紧张得仿佛要用电锯才能切开。明日香的父亲结结巴巴地说："但...我...我以为你刚才说...说我们...聊...聊一聊也没关系？"

"That was before I found out who you were," Shinji whispered in that same calm voice that radiated pure loathing.  
"那是在我发现你是谁之前，"真嗣用同样平静却充满纯粹厌恶的声音低语道。

Asuka's father was obviously not used to talking with a teenager like this and tried to retort angrily, "This doesn't concern you. So if you could please move out of the way I'd like to speak with my daug-"  
明日香的父亲显然不习惯这样和一个十几岁的孩子交谈，试图愤怒地反驳，“这与你无关。所以如果你能请让开，我想和我女儿谈谈——”

Shinji cut across him and with each word his voice grew louder, "What right do you have to speak to a daughter that you threw away! What right do you have to call her out when she's finally found some place that cares for her! YOU DON'T DESERVE TO TALK TO HER YOU PIECE OF SHIT!"  
真嗣打断了他，随着每个字音的升高，他的声音越来越大，“你有什么资格对一个你抛弃的女儿说话！她终于找到了一个关心她的地方，你有什么权利叫她出来！你不配和她说话，你这个混蛋！”

At Shinji's hate filled words, her father took a few hasty steps back as though giving himself a decent head start if Shinji decided to kill him.  
在真嗣充满仇恨的话语下，她的父亲急忙后退了几步，仿佛给自己留出了足够的距离，以防真嗣决定杀了他。

"Please," he started pleading. "I know I screwed up, and I know that I don't deserve to be forgiven. But please...she's my only daughter, and I still love her."  
"求你了，"他开始恳求道。"我知道我搞砸了，我也知道我不配被原谅。但是请……她是我唯一的女儿，我依然爱她。"

"LOVE HER! WHEN THE FUCK DID YOU EVER SHOW THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF LOVING HER!"  
"爱她！你他妈什么时候表现出过一丝爱她的迹象！"

"I'll get down on my hands and knees and beg for mercy if I have to. Just please..."  
"我愿意跪下双手合十乞求宽恕，只要请……"

Shinji glared hatefully at the man bowing in front of him. His entirely body twitched and it was taking an enormous amount of willpower to not break the guys skull open.  
真嗣憎恨地瞪着面前鞠躬的男人。他全身都在抽搐，需要极大的意志力才能克制住不把那家伙的头骨敲碎。

Grimacing back at him he took several slow steps towards the door before looking down at the pitiful human in front of him.  
他皱着眉头回瞪，慢慢地向门口走了几步，然后低头看着眼前可怜的人类。

"You lost the right to talk to her long ago. Don't come crawling back to her five years later as though you can make amends for everything that happened."  
“你早就失去了和她说话的权利。别五年后才爬回来，好像你能弥补发生的一切似的。”

Before her father was able to start begging again Shinji shut the door with a loud snap and locked the door knob along with the dead bolt. Misato be damned right now. If she forgot to bring her key to unlock the dead bolt then that was her problem.  
在她父亲再次开始乞求之前，真嗣砰的一声用力关上门，并锁上了门把手和防盗锁。现在就让美里见鬼去吧。如果她忘了带钥匙来开防盗锁，那就是她的问题了。

Shinji stood in front of the door for a few seconds. If he rang the door bell again then Shinji would have thrown open the door and really broken his skull. Though he was saved the opportunity to be arrested as he heard shuffling footsteps walking away from the door.  
真嗣站在门前几秒钟。如果他再次按响门铃，真嗣可能会猛地打开门，真的打破他的头骨。不过，他幸免于被逮捕的机会，因为他听到拖着脚步的声音从门口走开。

All the tension seemed to evaporate out of him. Even though he had put up a brave front he was honestly scared. Asuka's depiction of her father made him out to be a heartless man that wouldn't hesitate to violence. Before, he didn't know what to expect if he ever met the man. The contrast from his mind to reality was a long ways off. He seemed like a complete push over. Maybe it was the alcohol that made him particularly violent.  
所有的紧张情绪似乎都从他身上消失了。尽管他表面上装得很勇敢，但实际上他真的很害怕。明日香对她父亲的描述让他觉得那是一个冷酷无情、毫不犹豫使用暴力的人。以前，他不知道如果见到这个人会有什么期待。从他的想象到现实之间的差距很大。他看起来完全是个软弱的人。也许是因为酒精让他变得特别暴力。

Finally turning around he felt his face sag as he saw that Asuka hadn't moved from where he had left her and that tears were still pouring from her eyes. It seemed that they were built up over the course of many years.  
终于转过身来，他看到明日香仍站在他离开她的地方，泪水依旧从她的眼中涌出，他的脸不禁垮了下来。这些泪水似乎积攒了许多年。

Without hesitating he walked slowly towards, and, moments later, stood in front of Asuka. Words weren't needed to express each other, though Shinji couldn't possibly grasp what torment Asuka was currently going through. He wanted to let her know that he was there for her and opened his mouth to mention that.  
他毫不犹豫地慢慢走向她，片刻后站在明日香面前。无需言语，尽管真嗣无法理解明日香此刻所承受的痛苦，但他想让她知道他在她身边，于是张开嘴想要表达这一点。

Before his mouth got half open though she leaned forward and almost made him topple backwards as her entire body weight came crashing onto him. Instinctively, Shinji braced himself and brought his arms around her back so that she wouldn't slide off to the side. So, she was snugly being held against his chest. Shinji could feel the gallons of water slowly be soaked into his already sweating dripping shirt.  
然而，在他还没完全张开嘴之前，她向前一倾，几乎让他向后倒去，她的整个体重猛地压在他身上。本能地，真嗣稳住自己，双臂环抱住她的背，以免她滑向一旁。就这样，她紧紧地贴在他的胸前。真嗣能感觉到大量的泪水慢慢浸透了他早已汗湿的衬衫。

Asuka's legs finally gave in and the need to be standing became pointless. As her legs collapsed, so did Shinji's along with her as he matched his fall with hers. So, kneeling in the middle of the hallway, Shinji let Asuka shed her worries onto his chest. At first it had been solely him that had his arms around her waist. Though after a particularly loud wail, Shinji felt himself being pushing backwards onto the hard wooden floor while her arms wrapped around his waist.  
明日香的腿终于支撑不住，站立变得毫无意义。随着她的双腿瘫软，真嗣也跟着她一起倒下，他的跌落与她同步。于是，跪在走廊中央，真嗣让明日香将她的忧虑倾泻在他的胸膛上。起初，只有他双臂环抱着她的腰。但经过一阵特别响亮的哀嚎后，真嗣感到自己被向后推倒在坚硬的木地板上，而她的双臂则紧紧环绕在他的腰间。

'Huh?' '啊？'

Shinji didn't fully comprehend until long after his back had hit the floor; and Asuka's face was nestled against Shinji's collarbone, what was going on. It certainly was the closest they had come with an intimate moment. Asuka's body was perfectly aligned with Shinji's body to the point where he couldn't tell the difference between their two heartbeats. After a while, Shinji felt that a small pool was starting to build up in the crook of his collarbone and knew that this wasn't the time to be sharing something like this.  
真嗣直到背部重重地撞到地板，明日香的脸埋在他的锁骨间，才完全明白发生了什么。这无疑是他们迄今为止最亲密的时刻。明日香的身体与真嗣的身体完美契合，以至于他几乎分不清两人的心跳。过了一会儿，真嗣感觉到锁骨的凹陷处开始积聚泪水，他知道现在不是分享这种情感的时候。

Relinquishing his grip around Asuka's waist he brought his hands to her shoulder and tried to convince her to stand up, though she didn't seem to want to comply. While Shinji wasn't really disgusted by their position, he didn't want things to get carried away. If he took advantage of her, he wouldn't be able to forgive himself. If they were to develop a more romantic relationship he didn't want it built upon something so heart wrenching as this. So with a little more coaxing he managed to get Asuka to sit up, though in some aspects it was worse as she was now sitting in his lap. He was surprised at how small she seemed then.  
他松开了环绕在明日香腰间的手，转而扶住她的肩膀，试图说服她站起来，尽管她似乎并不愿意配合。虽然真嗣并没有真的对他们的姿势感到厌恶，但他不希望事情失控。如果他趁机占她便宜，他将无法原谅自己。如果他们要发展一段更浪漫的关系，他不希望它建立在如此令人心碎的基础上。因此，经过一番劝说，他终于让明日香坐了起来，尽管在某些方面这更糟糕，因为她现在正坐在他的腿上。他惊讶于她那时显得多么娇小。

"Asuka...you okay?" Of course she wasn't, but he found he had to start somewhere.  
“明日香……你还好吗？”当然她并不好，但他发现自己总得从某个地方开始。

Asuka however didn't seem like she was in the mood for talking quite yet and continued sitting in Shinji's lap with a dejected look on her face.  
然而，明日香似乎还没有心情说话，她继续坐在真嗣的腿上，脸上带着沮丧的表情。

After another minute of silence between the two, Shinji let out a weary sigh. It wasn't that he was annoyed with her switch to a helpless girl who couldn't do anything. He just didn't think that the helplessness suited her. She should be pacing around the room insulting her father and calming him as many names as she could muster. He would have gladly joined in.  
又是一分钟的沉默后，真嗣发出了一声疲惫的叹息。并非他对她突然变成一个无助的女孩感到恼火，只是他认为这种无助并不适合她。她本该在房间里踱步，用尽各种词汇辱骂她的父亲，同时安抚他。他倒是很乐意加入。

After the audible sigh Shinji decided to take things into his own hands. Sliding out carefully from under her, he held onto her arms so that she wouldn't topple backwards. After pulling the last of his left leg out from her, he propped his hands behind his back and glanced at her face. She had now pulled her knees up as close as they would go to her body and had buried her head between them.  
听到真嗣的叹息声后，他决定自己采取行动。小心翼翼地从她身下滑出，他抓住她的手臂以防她向后倒下。最后从她身下抽出左腿后，他双手撑在背后，瞥了一眼她的脸。她现在将膝盖紧紧地贴向身体，并将头埋在双膝之间。

After another pause she finally spoke. "Shin-ji...?"  
又是一阵停顿后，她终于开口了。"真嗣...？"

"...Hrm?" "...嗯？"

"Ari-gato..." "阿里嘎多..."

"...Don't worry about it."  
"...别担心。"

Shinji watched as Asuka finally looked up at him. Her tears appeared to have stopped but her eyes were extremely blood shot.  
真嗣看着明日香终于抬头望向他。她的泪水似乎已经止住，但双眼布满血丝。

"Think you can stand?" “觉得能站起来吗？”

Rubbing her eyes with the backs of her hands she mumbled, "Yeah...I think so."  
她用双手背揉了揉眼睛，含糊地咕哝道，“嗯……我想可以。”

Placing both hands on the ground she slowly pushed herself up and on to wobbly feet.  
她双手撑地，缓缓将自己推起，站到了摇摇晃晃的双脚上。

"See I'm fine," she said in an attempt to pass off everything that had happened. Though next second Shinji had to rush forward as she took a hasty step forward and ended up losing her balance.  
“看，我没事，”她试图轻描淡写地掩饰刚刚发生的一切。然而下一秒，真嗣不得不冲上前去，因为她急匆匆地迈出一步，结果失去了平衡。

With her head resting on Shinji's chest again she opened her mouth and mumbled something that Shinji had never expected.  
她的头再次靠在真嗣的胸前，张开嘴，含糊地说了些什么，这是真嗣从未预料到的。

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for this. It's because I'm so wea-"  
"对不起。我真的很抱歉。这都是因为我太软弱了——"

"Don't say it!" "别这么说！"

Shinji fiercely wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her in closer.  
真嗣紧紧地用双臂环住她的腰，将她拉得更近。

"...Don't say that...never. You're the strongest person I know."  
"...别这么说...永远不会的。你是我认识的最坚强的人。"

Asuka let out a small hiccup which seemed to be concealing a laugh. "Baka," though it was much softer. "Thats not something a girl would want to hear."  
明日香发出一声小小的呃逆，似乎是在掩饰笑声。"笨蛋，"虽然语气柔和了许多。"这不是女孩子想听的话。"

Shinji could have laughed. "Anyway, if you couldn't stand you should have said."  
真嗣本可以笑出声来。"总之，如果你站不住了，应该早点说。"

"...I didn't want to be a bother."  
"...我不想成为麻烦。"

"I'd worry about it nonetheless. Now come on, I'll take you over to the couch."  
"尽管如此，我还是会担心。来吧，我带你去沙发那边。"

"...Wait, Shinji. What are you...WHAAAAA?"  
"...等等，真嗣。你在做什么...哇啊啊啊？"

Asuka's protests were silenced as Shinji brought his left arm up and snaked it around Asuka's shoulders, while his right arm took her off her feet and ended up resting just under her thighs. So, in one fluid motion, Shinji ended of sweeping her off her feet. Which Asuka wasn't terribly thrilled at, as his right arm was dangerously close to her butt.  
当真嗣抬起左臂，绕过明日香的肩膀，同时右臂将她从脚上抱起，最终停在她大腿下方时，明日香的抗议声戛然而止。就这样，真嗣以流畅的动作将她横抱起来。明日香对此并不十分高兴，因为他的右臂离她的臀部太近了。

"Shinji...what are you doing...?"  
“真嗣……你在干什么……？”

Shinji could hear the obvious threat in her voice but didn't care, at least she was feeling better if she was able to talk like that. Though as he glanced down at her face which was frowning up at him he had to turn his eyes away quickly. She was blushing. Was she embarrassed? It seemed nothing would surprise him after the events of today.  
真嗣能听出她声音中的明显威胁，但他并不在意，至少她能这样说话说明她感觉好些了。然而，当他低头看到她皱着眉头看着他时，他不得不迅速移开视线。她脸红了。她是在害羞吗？经历了今天的事情后，似乎没有什么能再让他感到惊讶了。

Answering in a way that sounded like he didn't care, he replied, "This is the easiest way to move you, and its not like you're heavy or anything." 'More like you're too light," he mumbled in his mind. He felt now that she had been pushing herself to hard through the training and remembered that they had skipped meals occasionally. He rebuked himself for those times.  
他回答时那种满不在乎的语气让人听不出他的真实想法：“这是最轻松的移动你的方式，而且你也不重。”他心里嘀咕着，“更像是太轻了。”他现在感觉到她训练时太过拼命，想起了他们偶尔会错过吃饭的时间。他为自己那些时候的疏忽而自责。

Setting her down on the couch he propped a pillow behind her head and drew a blanket across her chest.  
他将她安置在沙发上，垫了一个枕头在她头后，又拉过一条毯子盖在她胸前。

"...Hang on I'll get you some tea."  
“...等一下，我去给你倒杯茶。”

"Hrm," mumbled Asuka as she curled up in the blanket.  
"嗯，" 明日香咕哝着，蜷缩在毯子里。

Walking out of the living room Shinji entered the kitchen and quickly busied himself with making tea, and rather strong at that. He had found Misato's stash of hard liquor while cleaning one day and figured that Asuka could use some of it.  
走出客厅，真嗣进入厨房，迅速忙碌起来，准备泡茶，而且还是相当浓的那种。他在某次打扫时发现了美里藏的烈酒，心想明日香或许需要来点。

Pouring something that had an alcohol content of forty-seven percent in the cup of tea, he carried it to the couch where Asuka had sat up to accept it.  
他将酒精含量高达四十七度的某种液体倒入茶杯中，然后端到沙发前，明日香已经坐起身来准备接过。

"Thanks," she mumbled. "谢谢，" 她咕哝道。

Taking a long gulp of it, her face turned sour for a moment as she thought about spiting it out.  
她大口喝下，脸上瞬间露出苦相，差点想吐出来。

"What the hell did you put in this?"  
"你到底在这东西里加了什么？"

"...Something to make it a little bit stronger."  
"...加点东西让它更强劲些。"

"Tastes like shit." "味道跟屎一样。"

"Its the thought that counts."  
"心意最重要。"

"I suppose...well, it certainly warmed me up."  
"我想...嗯，确实让我暖和起来了。"

A moment of silence passed between the two as Asuka held the half empty cup in her hands. Even without drinking any, the warmth that it still radiated was enough to warm her up significantly. That, and the fact that Shinji had made it.  
两人之间静默了片刻，明日香双手捧着那半满的杯子。即便没有喝上一口，它依然散发出的温暖已足以让她感到相当暖和。再加上这是真嗣泡的。

"I knew this would happen. Even so though, I had wished that it wouldn't."  
"我就知道会这样。尽管如此，我还是希望它不会发生。"

Shinji sat down on the floor in front of her and frowned up at her.  
真嗣在她面前坐在地板上，皱着眉头抬头看她。

"You mean you knew that your father would reappear? What made you think that?"  
“你是说你早就知道你父亲会再次出现？是什么让你这么认为的？”

"I don't know. Well...no, thats not true. My father can be very possessive at times. I figured he'd come looking for me when I had aged a little, since I look almost exactly like my mother. Even though he said all those things about my mother whenever he was drunk, he still cared for her. I think that he sees herself living through me."  
“我不知道。嗯……不，那不是真的。我父亲有时候占有欲很强。我想，当我长大一些，因为我长得几乎和我母亲一模一样，他会来找我的。尽管他每次喝醉时都会说那些关于我母亲的话，但他仍然关心她。我觉得他通过我看到了自己的影子。”

"Thats a twisted way of thinking. So what? He says he wants to see you again because you look like your mother?"  
"那是一种扭曲的思维方式。所以呢？他说他想再见你是因为你长得像你母亲？"

"Yeah, something like that, I think."  
"是啊，大概是这样，我想。"

"Bastard needs to stop living in the past. You are yourself, not some ghost of your dead mother."  
"那混蛋得停止活在过去。你是你自己，不是你已故母亲的幽灵。"

"As I said he's too possessive. He just wants to see the image of his wife in me."  
"正如我所说，他太过占有欲强了。他只是想在我身上看到他妻子的影子。"

Shinji snarled angrily at that point and stood up.  
听到这里，真嗣愤怒地咆哮着站了起来。

"I won't...no I can't. Something...just like that. Its just...disgusting. I swear that if he tries something like this again I'll step on him with Eva."  
"我不会...不，我不能。这种事...简直...令人作呕。我发誓，如果他再敢这样做，我会用 Eva 踩扁他。"

"Heh, heh, heh," after a short pause Asuka said, "thanks...Shinji. If you weren't there...I don't know how I would have dealt with it."  
"嘿嘿嘿，"短暂的停顿后，明日香说道，"谢谢你……真嗣。如果你不在那里……我不知道该怎么应对。"

"You won't have to worry about it again!"  
"你不必再担心了！"

Asuka at that time wearily shook her head and looked at the carpet with downcast eyes, "Thats not entirely true. He'll catch me off guard one day. I don't know what his job consists of right now, but I think he's a CEO in some company. He'll hire someone and eventually meet me through that guy."  
那时，明日香疲惫地摇了摇头，垂眼看着地毯，"那并不完全正确。总有一天他会让我措手不及。我不知道他现在的工作内容是什么，但我想他在某个公司担任 CEO。他会雇人，最终通过那个人与我见面。"

Shinji was shocked at how well Asuka had thought out these multiple scenarios. It showed how much she had prepared for this day.  
真嗣对明日香能如此周密地设想这些多种情况感到震惊。这显示了她为这一天做了多少准备。

"No...its better if I do this how I planned it..."  
“不……我还是按照原计划来比较好……”

Shinji flinched at her words. "What do you mean?"  
真嗣听到她的话后退缩了。“你这是什么意思？”

"This is my problem okay!" Said Asuka flaring up for a moment. "This is something that is my problem! I want to resolve this my way! I don't want to rely on anybody else to resolve this!"  
"这是我的问题，好吗！" 明日香一时激动地说道，"这是我的问题！我想用自己的方式解决！我不想依赖任何人来解决这个问题！"

A stunned silence passed between the two of them after her outburst. Shinji opened his mouth angrily to tell her that he didn't care. That he would help out anyway, when she cut him off.  
她的爆发之后，两人之间陷入了震惊的沉默。真嗣愤怒地张开嘴，想要告诉她他不在乎。他会无论如何都会帮忙，但她打断了他。

"No means no! Now stop asking!"  
"不就是不！现在别再问了！"

Shinji closed his mouth in a dejected way. Every fiber in his body was screaming out against her demand.  
真嗣沮丧地闭上了嘴。他身体的每一根神经都在尖叫着反对她的要求。

Her mood seemed to turn cool then as she looked around the state of the living room. "Even though last night was the last night to sleep in here we never did got around to moving back to our rooms."  
她的情绪似乎在那时变得冷淡起来，环顾着客厅的状况。“即使昨晚是最后一晚在这里睡觉，我们也没能搬回各自的房间。”

"...Yeah I suppose so..."  
“……是啊，我想也是……”

"No reason in going back now I suppose. Well, since it doesn't matter, I'm calling the couch."  
"现在回去也没什么理由了吧。好吧，既然无所谓，我就睡沙发了。"

'I'd give it to you even if didn't say that,' Shinji thought.  
'即使你没说，我也会给你的。' 真嗣心想。

"Oh...and, uh, Shinji/" "哦...还有，呃，真嗣/"

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

Shinji turned towards Asuka to see her sitting up with her hands in her lap. Shifting her lower body left and right it seemed like she was building up for something.  
真嗣转向明日香，看到她正坐起身，双手放在膝上。她左右挪动着下半身，似乎在为某事做准备。

"What?" Shinji asked again.  
“什么？”真嗣再次问道。

"I was hoping that you could sleep next to me tonight..."  
“我希望能和你今晚一起睡……”

"...ehh? ...WHAT?" "...嗯？...什么？"

"BAKA! I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT! PERVERT!"  
"笨蛋！我不是那个意思！变态！"

"Then how the hell did you mean it!"  
"那你到底是什么意思！"

"Well...that is...I mean. I wanted you to sleep on the ground next to the couch." Asuka said this last part very fast, while a light tinge of pink started to appear on her cheeks.  
"嗯...那个...我的意思是，我想让你睡在沙发旁边的地上。" 明日香最后这句话说得飞快，同时她的脸颊上开始泛起一抹淡淡的红晕。

"...I suppose... But why? If you don't mind."  
"...我想... 但为什么呢？如果你不介意的话。"

"...I think I'd feel better if I knew you were close..."  
"...我觉得如果知道你就在附近，我会感觉好一些..."

Shinji stuttered over his next words, "Ye-Yeah...sur-sure. No-no problem."  
真嗣结巴着说出下一句话，“也、也是……没、没问题。”

Asuka frowned at him and tutted slightly while thinking, 'Jeez, he doesn't have to get worked up so much.'  
明日香皱眉看着他，轻声咂舌，心想：‘天哪，他没必要这么紧张。’

Dragging his futon over towards the couch he laid it out next to it. Turning off the lights hastily he turned back to his futon and laid down on it. He could just make out the shape of Asuka's arm as it was laying next to the edge of the couch. Turning over on his side he closed his eyes and prepared to drop off to sleep when he felt her nudging his side.  
他拖着被褥走向沙发，铺在旁边。匆忙关掉灯后，他转身回到被褥上躺下。他能隐约看到明日香的手臂，它正搭在沙发边缘。他侧过身去，闭上眼睛准备入睡，这时感觉到她轻轻推了推他的侧身。

"Hey Shinji." "嘿，真嗣。"

Flipping over onto his other side he practically hissed, "What."  
他翻身到另一侧，几乎是咬牙切齿地说："干嘛。"

Asuka was on her other side now, looking down at him with her hand extended and her index finger recoiled slightly as though preparing to flick him in the head. Shinji flinched at the gesture and closed his eyes, expecting to feel a sharp pain through his nose. What happened was much different.  
明日香现在也侧躺着，手伸向他，食指微微弯曲，似乎准备弹他的头。真嗣被这动作吓得一缩，闭上眼睛，以为会感到鼻子上传来一阵剧痛。但发生的事情却截然不同。

Shinji had to open his eyes to confirm what had just transpired as he thought his brain must have temporarily turned off. Starting at the outline of Asuka's slightly smirking face, his eyes traveled down her arm and towards her hands. In the end he went cross eyed trying to see if what she was doing was true.  
真嗣不得不睁开眼睛确认刚刚发生的事情，他以为自己的大脑可能暂时关闭了。他的目光从明日香微微带笑的脸庞轮廓开始，顺着她的手臂向下移动，最终聚焦在她的手上。最后，他因为试图看清她是否真的在做那件事而变得眼花缭乱。

Asuka had her index finger pressed softly against Shinji's lips. Shinji felt his heart speed up and slow down maniacally in the span of three-seconds and thought that he might be having a heart attack. Her finger was unusually warm.  
明日香用食指轻轻按在真嗣的嘴唇上。真嗣感到自己的心跳在三秒钟内疯狂加速又减速，他以为自己可能心脏病发作了。她的手指异常温暖。

Looking back up at her smirking face Shinji saw thought he saw a glint in Asuka's eyes before she whispered, "Oyasumi."  
再次看向她那带笑的脸庞，真嗣觉得他看到了明日香眼中的一丝闪光，然后她轻声说道：“晚安。”

Pulling her index finger off his lips she flipped back over to her other side, let out a small yawn, and drifted towards sleep.  
她从他的唇上抽回食指，翻了个身，打了个小哈欠，渐渐沉入梦乡。

Shinji lay there for what felt like a decade before he came to his senses. Taking his own index up towards his lips he pressed them there for a minute before letting his arm flop useless at his side. He really didn't understand, but was happy as it was.  
真嗣躺在那里，感觉像是过了一个世纪才回过神来。他抬起自己的食指触碰嘴唇，停留了一会儿，然后无力地让手臂垂在身侧。他真的不太明白，但这样已经很开心了。

"Oyasumi," he mumbled before closing his eyes.  
“晚安，”他咕哝着，闭上了眼睛。

---

Shinji didn't dream that night, which was certainly a blessing. Though he felt that sleep left him too soon as something was pushing him roughly on the back.  
那一夜，真嗣没有做梦，这无疑是一种恩赐。尽管他觉得睡眠结束得太快，因为有什么东西在粗暴地推他的背。

"Shinji...OI, SHINJI!" “真嗣...喂，真嗣！”

Snapping his eyes open, he turned towards to the sound of the complaining. Asuka was sitting up on the couch while her legs were resting on Shinji's back. Glancing at the alarm clock on the other side of the room he saw that it read eight o'clock.  
他猛地睁开眼睛，转向那抱怨声的方向。明日香正坐在沙发上，双腿搭在真嗣的背上。他瞥了一眼房间另一边的闹钟，看到上面显示着八点。

"Uhh, to early," he mumbled while pushing Asuka's legs off him.  
"呃，太早了，" 他咕哝着把明日香的双腿从自己身上推开。

"No its not, and I'm hungry."  
"不早了，我饿了。"

"Its a weekend, lets sleep longer."  
"今天是周末，让我们多睡一会儿吧。"

"That should be my complaint. C'mon...make me breakfast."  
"那应该是我的抱怨。来吧...给我做早餐。"

Pushing against his back, Asuka ended up rolling Shinji over onto his stomach and then back onto his side.  
阿斯卡用力推他的背，结果把真嗣翻了个身，先是趴着，然后又侧躺着。

Turning towards her Shinji glared at her briefly, though it soon evaporated to that of a smirk. Her face looked like that of a child's on Christmas Eve.  
转向她，真嗣短暂地瞪了她一眼，但很快变成了得意的笑容。她的脸看起来就像圣诞前夜的孩子一样。

"Oh fine..I'm getting up."  
"哦好吧...我起床了。"

Shinji yawned widely and crawled out from under his blankets. Walking on tired legs, he slowly made it to the kitchen with the assistance from the wall as a support. Asuka walked behind him smiling widely the entire time.  
真嗣打了个大大的哈欠，从被窝里爬了出来。他拖着疲惫的双腿，靠着墙壁的支撑，慢慢地走向厨房。明日香跟在他身后，全程都笑得十分灿烂。

"Ok Asuka what do yo- ...Misato?"  
"好吧，明日香，你要我做什...美里？"

Shinji was looking at his guardian who was seated at the kitchen table with a spoon half way to her mouth.  
真嗣看着他的监护人，她坐在餐桌前，勺子半举在嘴边。

"...Oh, Shinji. Asuka. Morning."  
“……哦，真嗣。明日香。早上好。”

"...When did you get back?"  
“……你什么时候回来的？”

"Hmmm...a few hours ago I suppose. I can't remember last night very well."  
"嗯……我想是几个小时前吧。昨晚的事我记得不太清楚了。"

"Yeah I can smell-I mean tell."  
"是啊，我能闻到——我是说察觉到。"

"Hmph." "哼。"

Misato turned back to her measly breakfast as a small sigh escaped her lips. "So how come the dead-bolt was locked-"  
美里转回她那简陋的早餐，轻轻叹了口气。“那么，为什么门闩是锁着的？”

Shinji who was in the middle of opening the fridge froze as Asuka did the same thing as she sat down.  
正在开冰箱的碇真嗣僵住了，而坐在一旁的明日香也做了同样的动作。

"-because I seriously doubt that any burglar would bother trying to steal anything from this apartment."  
“——因为我实在不认为会有哪个小偷会费心从这间公寓偷东西。”

Shinji glanced over at Asuka quickly as he straightened up, though she didn't want to meet his gaze. She had become extremely interested in a pattern on the wooden table. Trying to pass it off, Shinji said, "Oh that? It was supposed to be a way to get back at you, for the training. In case you didn't have your key, you would have been locked out."  
真嗣迅速瞥了一眼明日香，随即挺直身子，但她并不想与他对视。她的注意力完全被木桌上的一个图案吸引住了。为了掩饰尴尬，真嗣说道：“哦，那个啊？原本是想报复你训练时的事，万一你没带钥匙，就会被锁在外面。”

"Hmph, not very thought out, and not a very good lie."  
“哼，考虑不周，也不是个高明的谎言。”

"Lie?" Asked Shinji as he put a glass of orange juice in front of Asuka.  
“谎言？”真嗣一边问，一边在明日香面前放了一杯橙汁。

"Yes, lie." "是的，撒谎。"

Shinji and Asuka both flinched in silence waiting for the hammer to drop.  
真嗣和明日香都沉默地缩了一下，等待着那不可避免的打击降临。

Sighing again, Misato leaned back in her chair and mumbled, "When I came home earlier this morning there was a man sitting on the stairs at the bottom of this apartment complex. He seemed to be mumbling Asuka's name over and over."  
再次叹了口气，美里向后靠在椅背上，喃喃自语道："今天清晨我回家时，在公寓楼的楼梯底部坐着一个男人。他似乎一直在反复念叨着明日香的名字。"

At her words Asuka accidently knocked the fresh glass of orange juice off the table where it met the hard ground with a shattering sound.  
听到她的话，明日香不小心将刚倒好的橙汁从桌上碰落，玻璃杯与坚硬地面相撞，发出破碎的声响。

Shinji stood there helplessly as Misato uttered a few words.  
真嗣无助地站在那里，听着美里说出几句话。

"Asuka...is he your father?"  
“明日香……他是你父亲吗？”

The walls came crashing down again as Asuka shuttered uncontrollably, and Shinji wasn't next to her. What separated the two of them was a wooden countertop that Shinji suddenly wanted to dive over to comfort her.  
墙壁再次轰然倒塌，明日香不由自主地颤抖着，而真嗣不在她身边。隔开两人的是一块木制柜台，真嗣突然有种冲动，想要越过它去安慰她。

"...Asuka," he mumbled, not knowing what to say.  
“……明日香，”他喃喃道，不知该说什么。

Misato turned her eyes towards him and he caught her meaning only to clearly, though he didn't like it. 'This is something she has to overcome. Stay out of it for now.'  
美里将目光转向他，他立刻明白了她的意思，尽管他并不喜欢这样。‘这是她必须克服的。现在先别插手。’

Turning back to Asuka, Misato saw that she had raised her face and muttered, "Yeah...that bastard is my father."  
转向明日香，美里看到她抬起脸，低声说道：“是啊……那个混蛋是我父亲。”

Shinji was shocked at how strong her voice was. It was like all doubt had been removed from her mind.  
真嗣对她的声音之坚定感到震惊。仿佛她心中的所有疑虑都已烟消云散。

"...So he is..." “……所以他真的是……”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"And? Are you going to talk to him?"  
"然后呢？你打算和他谈谈吗？"

It took all of Shinji's willpower to not blow up then. How could she even ask something like that? Though it was Asuka's reply that really threw him for a loop.  
那一刻，真嗣几乎用尽所有意志力才没有爆发。她怎么可能问出这样的问题？然而，真正让他感到意外的是明日香的回答。

"I think that I might...in the end."  
"我想我最终可能会...去和他谈谈。"

Shinji stood there dumbstruck at her words.  
真嗣站在那里，被她的话惊得目瞪口呆。

"...wha?" "...啥？"

Turning towards him Asuka said, "I thought I told you last night Shinji, that I wanted to do this my way. So would you stop worrying about me!"  
转向他，明日香说道：“真嗣，我昨晚不是告诉过你吗，我想按自己的方式来做。所以你能不能别再担心我了！”

"...I..." "...我..."

"Shinji," murmured Misato, "let Asuka decided. It is her life after all."  
"真嗣," 美里轻声说, "让明日香决定吧。毕竟这是她的人生。"

Shinji couldn't take any more.  
真嗣再也承受不住了。

"How the hell can you even be suggesting that she talks to her father! Do you know what the bastard has done...tried to do!"  
"你他妈怎么还能建议她去跟她父亲说话！你知道那混蛋做了什么...试图做什么吗！"

"Of course I know all about her past. I'm her guardian. I was given papers by the German branch of Nerv explaining everything about her."  
"我当然知道她的一切过去。我是她的监护人。德国分部 Nerv 给了我所有关于她的资料，解释了一切。"

"Then how the hell can you go along with this!"  
"那你怎么还能同意这种事！"

"Because its not my decision! Its hers!"  
"因为这不是我的决定！是她的！"

Shinji seemed to deflate, all the anger seeping out him.  
真嗣似乎泄了气，所有的怒气都从他身上消散了。

"Fine, whatever." "好吧，随便。"

"...Shinji," mumbled Asuka.  
"...真嗣," 明日香咕哝道。

"Go! If you want to talk to him so bad go!"  
"去吧！如果你这么想跟他说话就去吧！"

"Fine...I will." "好吧...我会去的。"

Standing up quickly Asuka trotted to her room, dressed quickly and took off out the door.  
阿斯卡迅速起身，快步走向她的房间，迅速穿上衣服，然后冲出门去。

Shinji meanwhile had turned the other way and was forcing himself to not take off after her. How could she be so stupid? Did she honestly want to talk to her useless father? Of course not!  
与此同时，真嗣转向了另一个方向，强迫自己不要追上去。她怎么能这么愚蠢？她真的想和那个无用的父亲谈话吗？当然不是！

"Shinji?" “真嗣？”

"...What?" "...什么？"

Turning back around, Shinji saw that Misato had her elbows resting on the table and had abandoned her breakfast. "Do think you know what's best for Asuka?"  
转过身来，真嗣看到美里将手肘撑在桌上，放弃了她的早餐。“你觉得自己知道什么对明日香最好吗？”

"Of course not. But I have enough sense to know that this is not!"  
“当然不知道。但我有足够的理智知道这绝不是！”

"Do you think this is what she wants?"  
"你觉得这是她想要的吗？"

He had to use every ounce of willpower to not shout.  
他不得不动用每一分意志力来克制自己不喊出声。

"No, of course not." "不，当然不是。"

Leaning back in her chair Misato muttered, "You don't really realize what's going through Asuka's head. Do you?"  
米萨托靠在椅背上喃喃自语，“你真的不知道明日香心里在想什么。对吧？”

"I don't rea...what is that supposed to mean!"  
“我不明白……你这是什么意思！”

Standing up quickly, Misato let her chair fall backwards and said quite passively, "Asuka wants to reconcile with her dad!"  
米萨托迅速站起身，椅子向后倒去，她相当平静地说道，“明日香想和她爸爸和好！”

"..."

"...What? That...can't be. How can she trust him...after... NO! THATS WRONG!"  
"...什么？那...不可能。她怎么能在...之后还信任他...不！那是错的！"

"Shinji listen to me." "真嗣，听我说。"

"NO! I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN!"  
"不！我不能让那种事发生！"

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

"WHAT!" "什么！"

"SIT DAMN IT AND LISTEN TO ME!"  
"坐下，该死的，听我说！"

Something about Misato's words seemed to draw him. Misato rarely had an outburst and this was the first that he could remember. Looking towards the door that he was half way to already, he looked back at the seat that she was pointing at.  
米萨托的话似乎吸引了他。米萨托很少情绪爆发，这是他记忆中的第一次。他朝已经走了一半的门口望去，又回头看了看她所指的座位。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"Fine..." “好吧……”

Turning around he walked back to the chair, crossed his arms and sat down.  
他转过身，走回椅子旁，交叉双臂坐了下来。

Misato sighed, picked up the chair that she had kicked aside, and sat down in it. Crossing her own arms and even her legs she frowned at the stubborn teenager that was sitting across from her.  
美里叹了口气，捡起她踢到一旁的椅子，坐了下来。她交叉双臂，甚至双腿，皱着眉头看向对面那个固执的少年。

"Shinji, don't you think your being a bit prejudice because of your own father."  
“真嗣，你不觉得自己因为父亲而有些偏见吗？”

"My own...what?" “我自己的……什么？”

"Look, to put it simply...you've never had a family. You were to young when your mother died and can't remember her. Your father...well, yes he left you, and so you've never known what family is like. So you can't understand how Asuka felt before her mother died."  
"听着，简单来说...你从未有过家庭。你母亲去世时你还太小，记不得她。你父亲...嗯，是的，他离开了你，所以你从未体验过家庭的滋味。因此，你无法理解明日香在她母亲去世前的心情。"

"But what does that-" "但这意味着什么-"

"It means, that deep down Asuka wishes for the days when she still had a family. Even if she doesn't want to admit it she still misses her father. Her father is the only relative that she still has. Well, I know that she has a grandmother on her mothers side but I don't think she's ever talked to her."  
"这意味着，明日香内心深处渴望着她还有家庭的日子。即使她不愿承认，她仍然想念她的父亲。她的父亲是她仅存的亲人。嗯，我知道她母亲那边还有个祖母，但我觉得她从未与她交谈过。"

"But what if-" "但如果万一——"

"You need to stop living in the past. Stop shoving your own hatred of your father onto Asuka. Don't you want her to be happy about this."  
"你得停止活在过去。别再把你自己对你父亲的恨意强加给明日香了。难道你不希望她为此感到高兴吗？"

"Well yes, but-" "嗯，是的，但是——"

"Shinji...are you worried that Asuka will leave?"  
"真嗣...你担心明日香会离开吗？"

An erie silence filled the house at her words. Shinji hadn't had time to think about something like this. Though now it certainly felt like a possibility. If Asuka and her father made up then she might move away. Of course she'd still be needed for Eva, but her father might move down here to be with her.  
她的话语让屋内弥漫着一种诡异的寂静。真嗣之前并未考虑过这样的问题。但现在，这确实成了一个可能。如果明日香和她父亲和好了，她可能会搬走。当然，她仍会被需要驾驶 EVA，但她的父亲可能会搬到这里来陪她。

"I haven't thought of that."  
"我还没想过这一点。"

"But its still possible."  
"但可能性依然存在。"

"...Yes, I suppose it is."  
"……是的，我想是的。"

"If Asuka does leave she will still be needed at Nerv. She's to deeply involved to simply be released now."  
"如果明日香离开，她在 NERV 仍会被需要。她牵涉得太深，现在不可能轻易脱身。"

"So at best I'll see her at Nerv and maybe at school."  
"所以最多我只能在 Nerv 见到她，或许还有学校。"

"Hmmm. She could change schools of course."  
"嗯，她当然可以转学。"

"This is all assuming that she will reconcile with her father."  
"这一切的前提是她能与父亲和解。"

"You still doubt her?" "你还在怀疑她吗？"

"No...I doubt her father."  
"不...我怀疑的是她父亲。"

"Well I can't deny that he was a bastard for what he did. But if it makes you feel a little better I did some research on him when Asuka first came to the Tokyo-3 branch. Apparently he became sober shortly after Asuka left. He seemed to realize that he had chased his daughter away. Shortly after he help a friend out with some business transactions, and was offered a position at a large investments firm. Earlier this year he was promoted to a CEO."  
"好吧，我不能否认他做那些事确实是个混蛋。但如果你觉得好受点的话，我在明日香刚来东京-3 分部时调查过他。显然，明日香离开后不久他就戒酒了。他似乎意识到自己把女儿赶走了。不久后，他帮一个朋友处理了一些商业交易，并被一家大型投资公司录用。今年早些时候，他被提拔为 CEO。"

"Sound like he got his shit together."  
"听起来他总算把自己的事情理顺了。"

"Well, thats one way of putting it."  
"嗯，这么说也行。"

The two lapsed into silence and shifted there eyes to the door at the end of the hallway. Would Asuka really decide to leave? Did she want to make up with her father like Misato said? Shinji was unsure about the things rushing through his head but knew that he'd be by Asuka's side if she needed him. He could promise her that much.  
两人陷入了沉默，目光转向走廊尽头的那扇门。明日香真的会决定离开吗？她是否像美里所说的那样，想要与父亲和解？真嗣脑海中涌动着种种疑问，但他知道自己会站在明日香身边，如果她需要他的话。他至少能向她承诺这一点。

Letting out a low sigh Misato stood up and said, "Well, no use in worrying about something thats already transpired."  
美里轻轻叹了口气，站起身来说道：“唉，已经发生的事情，再担心也没用了。”

"...Yeah I guess." “……是啊，我想也是。”

"Well I'm going to sleep."  
“好了，我要去睡了。”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"I haven't slept since two nights ago. I'm beat. Uh I think I might have had too much alcohol also."  
"我从两晚前就没睡过。累坏了。呃，我觉得我可能也喝多了点酒。"

Shinji blinked and replied, "I didn't think the words 'alcohol and too much' would ever come out of your mouth."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，回答道：“我没想到‘酒精和过量’这种词会从你嘴里说出来。”

"What? I'm still human after all."  
“什么？我毕竟还是个人类嘛。”

"Hmm, yeah." "嗯，是啊。"

Shinji stood up along with her and was just thinking of laying back down when the apartment door opened and in walked Asuka. Shinji could see her father standing a ways away and had to suppress the urge to glare at him as she closed the door.  
真嗣跟着她站了起来，正想着再躺回去时，公寓的门开了，明日香走了进来。真嗣看到她的父亲站在远处，不得不压下瞪他的冲动，在她关上门时。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"Err...is everything okay?"  
"呃……一切都还好吗？"

"Ah, yeah its fine. ...I'm going out for a while-  
“啊，嗯，没事的。……我要出去一会儿——”

Shinji frowned. It really did seem like she wanted to talk with her father. The corners of her mouth were pulled up slightly. Though it seemed she was trying to suppress the swelling feeling in her stomach.  
真嗣皱了皱眉。她似乎真的很想和父亲谈谈。她的嘴角微微上扬。尽管她似乎在努力压抑着胃里翻涌的感觉。

-so I thought I'd just let you know."  
——所以我想还是告诉你一声。”

"Ah...okay..." "啊...好的..."

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Its fine," he mumbled while turning around. "If this is what you want then I shouldn't stop you."  
"没关系，"他嘟囔着转过身。"如果这是你想要的，那我就不该阻止你。"

"...Thanks for understanding. ...Cya later then."  
"...谢谢你的理解。...那回头见。"

Asuka turned around and had just put a hand on the door nob when she felt something grab her other hand. Turning her head she saw that Shinji was looking keenly at her, as though his eyes could pierce the hesitancy in her heart.  
明日香转过身，手刚放在门把手上，就感觉到另一只手被什么东西抓住了。她转过头，看到真嗣正热切地注视着她，仿佛他的目光能穿透她心中的犹豫。

"Be sure to call if anything happens..."  
"有事一定要打电话..."

"...I will..." "...我会..."

Relinquishing the firm grasp on her hand, Shinji watched as she hurriedly opened the door. Looking back at him, she gave him a reassuring smile before turning to her father with an equally wide smile on her face. As the door swung closed Shinji had difficulty suppressing the emotion that were welling up inside of him. He didn't know when he'd see her again.  
松开紧握她的手，真嗣看着她匆忙打开门。回头望向他，她给了他一个安心的微笑，然后转向她的父亲，脸上同样挂着灿烂的笑容。随着门缓缓关闭，真嗣难以抑制内心涌动的情感。他不知道何时才能再次见到她。

---

Shinji ended up going back to sleep, even though he felt wide awake before. He just didn't know what he was supposed to do in a situation like this. Running away from the present was all he felt like doing, and thats why he decide to sleep for the remainder of the day. Though it was still difficult. He floated in and out of his dreams and everything seemed to co-mingle, and lead to a depressing future. One that didn't involve Asuka.  
真嗣最终还是回去睡觉了，尽管之前他感觉异常清醒。他只是不知道在这种情境下该做什么。逃离现实是他唯一想做的事，因此他决定睡上一整天。尽管这依然很困难。他在梦境中时隐时现，一切都似乎交织在一起，导向一个令人沮丧的未来。一个没有明日香的未来。

It felt weird when he sat up suddenly, all sleepiness apparently gone, though he wasn't particularly sleepy in the first place. At first he thought that somebody had woken him up but realized that there was no one else in the room besides.  
他突然坐起身，所有的睡意似乎都消失了，虽然一开始他并不特别困。起初他以为有人叫醒了他，但随即意识到房间里除了他没有其他人。

'Thats right, Asuka's off for a bit.' He said just a bit but in reality he was nervous about never seeing her again. What if something happened between her and her father and he got violent again. Would she be able to escape and return? Or would he find her and-  
'没错，明日香暂时离开了。'他虽然说只是暂时，但实际上他担心可能再也见不到她了。万一她和她父亲之间发生了什么事，他又变得暴力起来。她能逃脱并回来吗？还是他会找到她——

"Fuck no!" He yelled while standing up. "Thats not gonna happen!"  
"绝不！"他站起来大喊。"那绝不会发生！"

"Eh, what's not gonna happen?"  
“呃，什么不会发生？”

Shinji had to blink several times to get his eyes back into focus. The slow form of Misato started to appear in front of his eyes. 'So this is what being drunk is like,' he thought.  
真嗣不得不眨了几次眼，让视线重新聚焦。米莎托的缓慢身影开始出现在他眼前。‘这就是喝醉的感觉啊，’他想。

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"Is Asuka back yet?" “明日香回来了吗？”

"Nope, its only been a few hours. Its only around noon."  
"没有，才过了几个小时。现在才中午左右。"

"Ah...I see." "啊...我明白了。"

"Anyway could you do me a favor?"  
"那么，你能帮我个忙吗？"

"...Like what?" "...比如什么？"

"Ah...well, I'd do it myself but I've got a splitting head ache. So could I ask you to run over to Rei's apartment and give this to her."  
"啊...好吧，我自己去的话头会很疼。所以能请你跑一趟，把这个交给丽吗？"

"Give? ...Wait huh? Ayanami?"  
"交给？...等等，绫波？"

"Yes, this." Holding out a small laminated card Shinji saw that it was a security card with Rei's face and profile on it.  
"是的，这个。" 伸出一小张塑封卡片，真嗣看到那是一张安全卡，上面印着绫波的脸部和简介。

"Is this a security card?"  
"这是一张安全卡吗？"

"Precisely. Hers expired so I need to give it to her. Could you to give it to her"  
"正是。她的过期了，所以我需要交给她。你能帮我转交给她吗？"

"Erm...well I suppose so."  
“呃……嗯，我想是的。”

"Ah thanks. I wasn't sure how I was suppose to give it to her. Anyway here's her address. Do you know where it is?"  
“啊，谢谢。我不确定该怎么给她。总之，这是她的地址。你知道在哪里吗？”

Shinji glanced down at the street and number. He had passed it many times when he used to take his evening strolls.  
真嗣低头看了看街道和门牌号。他以前在傍晚散步时曾多次经过那里。

"Yeah, I'm familiar with the area."  
"是的，我对这一带很熟悉。"

"Ah, good. Well off you go then."  
"啊，那就好。那么，你走吧。"

"Ah...okay. ...Wait. Has anybody called?"  
"啊...好的。...等等。有人打电话来吗？"

Misato seemed to see through his casual comment and said, "Don't worry I'm sure that Asuka is fine."  
美里似乎看穿了他随意的评论，说道：“别担心，我相信明日香没事。”

"...Yeah. Well cya." “……嗯。那再见。”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Shinji tossed a pair of socks and socks on with a sweater that he grabbed out of his room. It looked like it would rain soon.  
真嗣扔了一双袜子，套上从房间里抓出的毛衣。看起来很快就要下雨了。

Sure enough, as he made his way down the steps of the apartment complex, he felt the first droplets of rain. Looking up at the sky he saw dark grey clouds hovering overhead. It seemed that it would get nasty soon and a thundershower looked possible. He was inadvertently reminded about his first encounter with Asuka and the subsequent task of hauling her back in the freezing could rain. He hoped that something similar wouldn't happen.  
果然，当他走下公寓楼的台阶时，感觉到了第一滴雨。抬头望向天空，只见头顶上乌云密布。看来很快就会变得恶劣，雷阵雨似乎有可能发生。他不经意间想起了与明日香初次相遇的情景，以及随后在冰冷的雨中将她拖回来的任务。他希望类似的事情不会再次发生。

---

"I suppose this is the place," Shinji mumbled as he stood outside of a door in the freezing cold. The walk was longer than he remembered and he had gotten soaked on the way. Now though, he was standing with a soaking sweatshirt and equally soaking pants, standing outside of a door that read Ayanami Rei on the door.  
“我想这就是地方了，”真嗣在寒风中站在一扇门外喃喃自语。这段路比他记忆中的要长，而且他在路上已经湿透了。现在，他站在一扇写着“绫波零”的门前，身上湿漉漉的毛衣和同样湿透的裤子让他感到十分不适。

Not noticing a door bell anywhere he knocked on the door twice and muttered.  
没有发现门铃，他敲了两次门，低声嘀咕道。

"Ah, Ayanami...its me...Shinji. Umm...I've got something that Misato wanted me to give you. So if you could...open the door...or something."  
“啊，绫波...是我...真嗣。呃...美里让我给你带点东西。所以如果你能...开下门...之类的。”

Shinji realized then that this was probably the most he had ever said to Rei.  
真嗣那时意识到，这可能是他对绫波说过最多话的一次了。

After waiting there for several minutes he started to get annoyed. Without thinking about the consequences he muttered, "I'm coming in," and turned the door nob. In reality he hadn't been expecting it to be unlocked and now had no choice but to enter the small apartment.  
在门外等了几分钟后，他开始感到不耐烦。没多想后果，他咕哝了一句“我要进来了”，便转动门把手。实际上，他并没料到门会没锁，现在别无选择，只能走进那间小公寓。

He was first impression wasn't one of glamour, thats for sure. The apartment was one giant room it seemed except for a closet and the bathroom. The kitchen was off to the side which hardly looked as if it had been used and at the far end of the long room was a bed that seemed dark and depressing.  
他的第一印象绝非光鲜亮丽，这一点毋庸置疑。公寓似乎只有一个巨大的房间，除了一个壁橱和浴室。厨房在一侧，看起来几乎从未使用过，而在长房间的尽头是一张显得阴暗压抑的床。

Taking his shoes off he walked through the small apartment and ended up looking down at the bed where Rei must sleep each night. It really seemed like it had not been used in ages. The small table next to it seemed similar as dust had settled on it. Did someone even live here?  
他脱下鞋子，穿过狭小的公寓，最终站在雷的床前俯视着。这张床看起来似乎已经很久没人睡过了。旁边的小桌子也相似，灰尘覆盖其上。这里真的有人住吗？

Without knowing what else to do he ended up leaning against the wall opposite the table. Pulling out the security card that Misato had give him he glanced at it. Rei really was an unusual person. Even though all the info about her person was on the card, he still felt that something was lacking. He couldn't quite place it though.  
不知该做什么，他最终靠在桌子对面的墙上。拿出美里给他的安全卡，他瞥了一眼。丽确实是个与众不同的人。尽管卡上有她所有的个人信息，他仍觉得缺少了些什么。但具体是什么，他又说不清楚。

As he was about to place it back in his pocket he heard the opening and closing of a door, which made him jump and drop the card that he was holding. Bounding off against the wall he swiped the card off the ground and skidded into view of Ayanami Rei who had just opened the door to her apartment.  
正当他准备将卡片放回口袋时，他听到了开门和关门的声音，这让他吓了一跳，手中的卡片也随之掉落。他迅速从墙边跳起，从地上抓起卡片，滑行到绫波零的视线中，她刚刚打开了自己公寓的门。

Under normal circumstances, and a normal girl, Shinji would have found himself getting a face full of pepper spray and a kick to the crotch. Instead though Rei seemed to completely ignore his existence, place the bag she was carrying on the kitchen and stroll past him.  
在正常情况下，面对一个普通女孩，真嗣可能会遭遇满脸的胡椒喷雾和一脚踢向胯部。然而，零似乎完全无视了他的存在，将手中的袋子放在厨房，然后径直从他身边走过。

Shinji hesitated before he turned his head to see what she was doing, and almost face palmed. She was changing. If he hadn't been living with Asuka and Misato for over a month this might have made him die of a nose bleed. Instead he turned his head back around and waited until she was done. Though really nothing had changed, as she was wearing the same school uniform that she always wore. What, did she have twenty pairs of the same outfit? Asuka would have a fit at her wardrobe.  
真嗣犹豫了一下，然后转头看她在做什么，差点捂脸。她在换衣服。如果不是和明日香及美里同居了一个多月，这情景可能会让他流鼻血而亡。相反，他转回头，等待她换完。尽管实际上什么都没变，她穿的还是那套校服，她总是穿的那套。难道她有二十套同样的衣服吗？明日香看到她的衣柜肯定会发疯。

Turning around, he had to take a step back as he found that she had closed the distance between them. He was looking back into her crimson eyes.  
转过身，他不得不后退一步，因为她已经拉近了他们之间的距离。他再次迎上了她那双深红色的眼睛。

"Why are you here?" She asked, though without anger.  
“你为什么在这里？”她问道，语气中并无怒意。

"Oh...that, right." “哦...那个，对了。”

Reaching into his pocket he pulled out the security card that Misato had given him.  
他伸手从口袋里掏出了美里给他的安全卡。

"Misato wanted me to give this to you."  
“美里让我把这个交给你。”

Blinking as though she didn't understand she held out her hand and Shinji let it slide into her outstretched palm.  
她眨了眨眼，仿佛没明白，随即伸出手，真嗣便将卡片滑入她摊开的掌心。

With saying anything else she deposited the card on the table and walked towards the kitchen to put away the things she got.  
没再多说什么，她将卡片放在桌上，走向厨房去收拾刚买回来的东西。

Not sure what to say in her presence, Shinji gestured around the apartment and said, "Nice place."  
在她面前不知该说什么，真嗣环顾了一下公寓，说道：“挺不错的地方。”

'Couldn't I have thought of something a little better than that,' he sighed in his mind?  
“我就不能想出点更好的话吗，”他在心里叹息道？

"It suits me." “很适合我。”

Shinji turned towards her and saw that her expression had not changed at all. Not sure of what to say anymore he muttered, "Well, I guess I'll take off then."  
真嗣转向她，发现她的表情完全没有变化。不确定该说什么了，他低声咕哝道：“嗯，我想我该走了。”

Walking past her silently he reached the door and was about to turn the nob when she mumbled.  
他默默地从她身边走过，到达门口，正要转动门把手时，她喃喃自语。

"Goodbye." “再见。”

Shinji's eyes darted back towards her, but her expression had still had changed as she started opening cupboards. Well, at least she had opened up a little. Turning the door nob, he walked out into the pouring rain.  
真嗣的目光再次投向她，但她已经开始打开橱柜，表情依旧未变。好吧，至少她稍微敞开了些心扉。他转动门把手，走进了倾盆大雨中。

---

"So? How did it go?"  
“那么？情况如何？”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"I mean talking with Rei. How did it go?"  
"我是说和丽交谈。情况怎么样？"

"How was it supposed to go," mumbled Shinji back at Misato?  
"还能怎么样，" 真嗣咕哝着对美里说？"

"I was just curious if you were nervous at all"  
"我只是好奇你是否感到紧张"

"A little I suppose, since I don't know her all that well."  
"我想有一点吧，毕竟我对她了解不多。"

"Well, thats understandable. She doesn't talk all that much with everyone, except for the commander of course."  
"嗯，这可以理解。她不怎么和所有人说话，除了指挥官当然。"

"The comman-...my father?"  
"指挥官...我父亲？"

"Yeah, thats what we're supposed to call him at Nerv."  
“是的，在 NERV 我们得这么称呼他。”

"I always forget that he's an important figure there. So she talks to my father?"  
“我总是忘记他在那里是个重要人物。那她和我父亲交谈吗？”

"Yeah, quite animately in fact."  
“是的，实际上相当生动活泼。”

"...I can't imagine anybody talking to my father and enjoying the conversation."  
"...我无法想象有人和我父亲交谈还能享受那个过程。"

"Thats because you've never tried yourself."  
"那是因为你从未亲自尝试过。"

"Can't deny that. Well, I'm going back to sleep."  
"这一点我无法否认。好吧，我要回去睡觉了。"

"Huh? Why?" "嗯？为什么？"

Shrugging, Shinji said, "No reason. Just nothing else to do today."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，说道：“没什么特别的原因。只是今天没什么其他事情可做。”

"Admit it. You're just waiting till Asuka gets home."  
"承认吧。你只是在等明日香回家。"

"Am not! I just...don't have anything else to do today is all."  
"才不是！我只是...今天没什么其他事情要做罢了。"

"Hai, Hai. Keep telling yourself that."  
"是，是。你就继续这么告诉自己吧。"

"Ah, Urusai." "啊，吵死了。"

---

Again. 再一次。

Shinji sat bolt upright in his bed. After a rather reluctant argument with himself, he decided to move the futons back to their respected room, including Asuka's. Now he was in his room, in his own futon, with his body entangled in the blankets. The dream that had woken him up had not been pleasant. No, words couldn't even describe it.  
真嗣猛地从床上坐直。经过一番不情愿的自我争论后，他决定将被褥搬回各自的房间，包括明日香的。现在他回到了自己的房间，躺在自己的被褥里，身体被毯子缠绕着。那个将他惊醒的梦并不愉快。不，用言语甚至无法形容。

Spinning around, he first looked out the small window and was shocked to see that night had already fallen. Turning the other way, he glanced at the clock that was on his small dresser. It read seven-thirty. Something seemed to click in his head. Seven-thirty?  
他转过身，首先望向小窗外，惊讶地发现夜幕已经降临。转向另一边，他瞥了一眼放在小梳妆台上的时钟。上面显示七点半。他脑海中似乎有什么东西被触动了。七点半？

At the sudden realization at how long he had been sleeping he quickly jumped up and threw open the door. Darkness greeted him. Apparently he was the only other person in the house. Misato must have gone out not long ago and...Asuka. Where was Asuka?  
突然意识到自己睡了多久，他迅速跳起来，猛地推开门。迎接他的是一片黑暗。显然，他是家里唯一醒着的人。美里一定不久前出去了，还有……明日香。明日香在哪里？

Walking into the living he quickly flipped on the lights and glanced around. He didn't see any changes since he moved stuff back to there rightful place. Even the couch didn't seem like anybody had been on it since morning.  
走进客厅，他迅速打开灯，环顾四周。自从他把东西搬回原位后，似乎没有任何变化。就连沙发也好像从早上起就没人坐过。

Next second a blue flash seared in front of the window and made Shinji jump. It seemed that it was still raining, and had worsened.  
下一秒，一道蓝光在窗前闪过，让真嗣吓了一跳。看来雨还在下，而且变得更糟了。

Furthermore, it was late at night and still Asuka hadn't come back. 'Well, maybe she had left a message,' Shinji told himself.  
此外，已是深夜，而明日香仍未归来。'嗯，或许她留了消息吧，'真嗣自言自语道。

No message. Looking at the cordless phone he instantly knew that she hadn't called as there wasn't a blinking light. Now he was starting to get worried.  
没有留言。他瞥了一眼无绳电话，立刻明白她没有来电，因为没有闪烁的指示灯。现在他开始感到担忧了。

'Well, I suppose she could have gotten sidetracked while with her father and-'  
'嗯，我想她可能和她父亲在一起时被什么事情耽搁了——'

Somebody knocked on the door.  
有人敲了门。

Shinji spun around so quickly that he cricked his neck and at the same time froze. If it was Misato or Asuka why would they bothering knocking on the door. Unless Misato had locked it before she left and now Asuka was standing there infuriated that she was locked out.  
真嗣猛地转身，快得扭到了脖子，同时僵住了。如果是美里或明日香，他们为什么要敲门呢？除非美里离开前锁了门，现在明日香正站在外面，因为被锁在外面而气愤不已。

Gathering himself as he walked towards the door, he at first thought of opening it without worrying who it was, but decided on the safer course of action. This wasn't the most friendly neighbor hood in Tokyo-3 Shinji had learned.  
他一边走向门口，一边整理思绪，起初想着不问是谁就开门，但最终还是选择了更安全的做法。真嗣已经了解到，这是第三新东京市里不太友好的街区之一。

"Ah...who is it." “啊……是谁？”

"...Me..." “……是我……”

Shinji tore the door open so hard that the hinges threatened to snap off. Breathing heavily, as though he had just ran a mile, he was looking at a soaking wet Asuka who's face was currently aimed at the ground. Only now did Shinji remember what she had left in. This morning no one would have guessed that the weather would have turned out so nasty. The sun was out without a trace of clouds in the sky. Four hours later the sky looked like someone had painted it grey.  
真嗣用力拉开房门，力度之大仿佛要将铰链扯断。他喘着粗气，仿佛刚跑完一英里，目光投向浑身湿透的明日香，她的脸此刻正对着地面。直到这时，真嗣才想起她早上穿的是什么。今早没人料到天气会变得如此恶劣。阳光明媚，天空万里无云。四小时后，天空却像是被人涂成了灰色。

Asuka had been in such a hurry that morning that she had thrown on a pair of jean-like shorts that went down to her knees, while she wore a white sleeveless shirt with a pair of sandals. Certainly not the type of clothes you'd want to walk around in the rain with.  
那天早上，明日香匆匆忙忙，随手套上了一条类似牛仔裤的及膝短裤，穿着一件白色无袖衬衫和一双凉鞋。显然，这不是你想在雨中漫步的服装类型。

Her strawberry colored hair was messy, and plastered all over her face. She was shivering uncontrollably and seemed to have tears running down her face. It didn't help that her shirt was completely see through, revealing the white bra underneath.  
她那草莓色的头发凌乱不堪，贴满了整张脸。她不停地颤抖，脸上似乎还挂着泪水。更糟糕的是，她的衬衫完全透明，露出了里面的白色胸罩。

Shinji stood in the warmth of the apartment, while Asuka stood on the doorstep in the freezing rain. The two contrasts couldn't have been more different.  
真嗣站在温暖的公寓里，而明日香则站在门口的冰冷雨中。两者的对比再鲜明不过了。

Unable to say a word Shinji took a few small steps forward until he was directly in front of her. He could feel the warm breath as it tumbled out of her mouth and landed on his face.  
无法说出任何话，真嗣向前迈了几小步，直到直接站在她面前。他能感觉到她温暖的呼吸从口中喷涌而出，落在他的脸上。

Opening his mouth to the smallest degree, one would have thought he was a ventriloquist as he whispered, "Hey...Asuka..."  
他微微张开嘴，仿佛是个腹语者一般轻声低语，"嘿...明日香..."

Her shoulders seemed to tremble violently at the sound of his voice. Slowly shifting her head to look up at him, she opened her mouth a fraction of an inch and whispered back, "S-Shi-Shin-shinji...Shinji!...Shinji!...SHIN-"  
听到他的声音，她的肩膀似乎在剧烈颤抖。她缓缓转过头来，抬头看着他，微微张开嘴，轻声回应，"真-真-真嗣...真嗣！...真嗣！...真-

Shinji cut her off before she was able to continue. Wrapping one arm around her waist and clasping his hand in hers, he pulled her forcefully through the door with such ferocity that he was afraid he might have pulled her arm out of its socket. To anybody that was watching this it would have looked like they were dancing.  
真嗣在她继续说之前打断了她。他用一只手臂环住她的腰，握住她的手，猛地将她拉过门去，力度之大以至于他担心可能会把她胳膊拽脱臼。在旁人看来，这一幕倒像是在跳舞。

Quickly slamming the door he turned to the dripping wet Asuka where a puddle had started to form beneath her. He had over a hundred questions to ask her, each one more reluctant than the last. But he knew he'd have to eventually. First though he had to get her out of those wet clothes.  
他迅速关上门，转身面对浑身湿透的明日香，她脚下已经开始形成一滩水迹。他有一百多个问题想问她，每个问题都比前一个更犹豫。但他知道终究得问出口。不过首先，他得让她换掉那身湿衣服。

"C'mon...lets get you out of those wet clothes first. You must be freezing."  
“来吧...我们先帮你把湿衣服换掉。你一定冻坏了。”

Asuka didn't acknowledge that she heard him, nor did she even seem to recognize where she was. Maybe she thought she was still out in the rain.  
明日香没有回应他，甚至似乎没有意识到自己在哪里。也许她以为自己还站在雨中。

Taking matters into his own hands he grabbed both her hands this time and steered her towards her own room. Moving the door open with his foot he pulled her gently into her own room and had her sit on her futon while he searched for something warm.  
他决定亲自行动，这次紧紧抓住她的双手，引导她走向自己的房间。用脚推开门，他轻轻地将她拉进房间，让她坐在被褥上，同时寻找着暖和的东西。

"Uh lets see...hmmm...this will do I suppose," he mumbled to himself after settling on a large red sweater and a long pair of pants. Though things didn't go as smoothly as he wished.  
“呃，让我看看……嗯……这个应该可以吧，”他自言自语道，最终选定了一件大红色毛衣和一条长裤。虽然事情并没有像他希望的那样顺利。

After grabbing a towel from the bathroom and wrapping her wet hair in it he encountered a problem. Asuka didn't seem willing or able to change out of her clothes. Shinji wasn't sure, nor did he want to know what had triggered this helplessness. But he certainly had a good idea and could feel the blood pounding in his ears as he thought about killing the man.  
从浴室抓了条毛巾，将她湿漉漉的头发裹起来后，他遇到了一个问题。明日香似乎既不愿意也不可能换掉她的衣服。真嗣不确定，也不想知道是什么引发了这种无助感。但他确实有个不错的猜测，一想到要杀掉那个人，他就能感觉到血液在耳中轰鸣。

After turning over many ideas in his mind he decided to just go with the most blunt option...and help her into her clothes. Finding a long black sock in his room, he tied it securely around the back of his head so that it would cover his eyes. He was determined to keep her dignity in tact.  
在脑海中翻来覆去地思考了许多方案后，他决定采取最直接的方法——帮她穿上衣服。在房间里找到一只长长的黑色袜子，他将其紧紧地绑在脑后，确保能遮住眼睛。他决心维护她的尊严。

After much hassle while trying to get her shirt off she finally seemed to get the idea and complied with his actions. It was a lot more difficult then he imagined, as he had to do it solely through touch and experiment. Normally he would have been killed twenty times over. Ten for even thinking about doing this, and another ten for even attempting it.  
在费尽周折试图帮她脱下衬衫后，她终于似乎明白了他的意图并配合了他的行动。这比他想象的要困难得多，因为他只能通过触摸和尝试来完成。通常情况下，他早就被杀了二十次了。十次是因为哪怕只是想这么做，另外十次是因为居然还敢尝试。

After finally getting her to kick off her shorts, he was rather reluctant to continue with the next step and was extremely glad when she spoke up.  
终于让她脱掉了短裤后，他对下一步相当犹豫，当她开口时，他感到非常庆幸。

"Enough...I'm not a child."  
“够了……我不是小孩子。”

Sighing in a weary and happy way, he mumbled, "Glad to see that you've come to your-"  
他疲惫而幸福地叹了口气，喃喃道：“很高兴看到你终于……”

"KEEP THAT FUCKING THING ON!"  
"把那该死的东西戴上！"

Shinji was just in the middle of pulling the sock down, so that it didn't cover his eyes anymore, when his hand was grabbed and forcefully removed from the sock.  
真嗣正要把袜子拉下来，这样它就不会再遮住他的眼睛了，这时他的手被抓住，并强行从袜子上移开。

"What are you-" "你在干什么——"

"I'm changing out of my underwear damn it! Keep that damn thing on until I say so. And don't even think about look-"  
"我正换内衣呢，该死的！在我允许之前，别脱那该死的东西。而且别想着偷看——"

"I don't think you have to worry about me looking. After practically stripping you with my own two hands I think I've had enough for one night."  
"我觉得你不用担心我会偷看。亲手帮你脱得差不多了，今晚我已经看够了。"

Shinji heard a sharp intake of breath then and flinched as he thought he was about to get slapped across the face. Though no stinging sensation appeared on his face.  
真嗣听到一声急促的吸气声，然后缩了缩身子，以为自己要被扇耳光了。不过脸上并没有出现火辣辣的感觉。

After several minutes of hearing her shifting clothes around, Shinji was allowed to take off his rudimentary blind fold.  
在听到她摆弄衣服几分钟后，真嗣终于被允许摘下他那简陋的眼罩。

"About time..." “终于……”

"Shut it." “闭嘴。”

Asuka had changed into what Shinji had chosen and was wearing the red sweatshirt and dark blue jeans. It also seemed that she had chosen a long sleeve shirt underneath the sweatshirt, though Shinji could only see the sleeve of it. She still had the towel around her head and was now rubbing her wet hair with it.  
明日香已经换上了真嗣挑选的衣服，穿着红色运动衫和深蓝色牛仔裤。她似乎还在运动衫里面穿了一件长袖衬衫，不过真嗣只能看到袖子部分。她头上依旧裹着毛巾，现在正用它擦拭湿漉漉的头发。

"...Hey...lets go into the living room."  
“...嘿...我们去客厅吧。”

"...Why?" "...为什么？"

"I want to know why you've come home in the soaking wet rain of course. C'mon, I'll make you some hot chocolate."  
“我当然想知道你为什么会在大雨中淋得湿透回家。来吧，我给你弄点热巧克力。”

"...It's fine." "...没事的。"

"No it isn't actually!" "其实不是这样的！"

"I thought I told you to let me worry about my own problems!"  
"我记得我告诉过你，让我自己操心我的问题！"

"Damn it! Do you know how worried I was! I slept most of the day because I didn't want to face the reality that you might leave."  
"该死！你知道我有多担心吗！我一整天大部分时间都在睡觉，因为我不想面对你可能离开的现实。"

"...Worried?" "...担心？"

"Yes. So let me help you. No, I want to help you."  
"是的。所以让我帮你。不，我想要帮你。"

"Shin-ji." "真嗣。"

Tears started to well up in Asuka's eyes, but she brushed them to the side with the back of her hand.  
泪水开始在明日香的眼中打转，但她用手背迅速拭去。

"Hmm. Okay." "嗯，好吧。"

Taking Asuka's hand, he pulled her out of her sitting position, and into the living room. Leading her to the couch, he wrapped a blanket around her shoulders, and hurried off to make the hot chocolate.  
他牵起明日香的手，将她从坐姿中拉起，带进了客厅。领她到沙发前，他用毯子裹住她的肩膀，然后急忙去准备热巧克力。

After rummaging around in the cupboard he found some cocoa and marshmallows and quickly added the hot milk.  
在橱柜里翻找了一番后，他找到了一些可可粉和棉花糖，迅速将其加入热牛奶中。

Rushing back to the living room, he was surprised to find that she had turned the T.V. on was now slouching on the couch cushions. Maybe nothing had really happened and she had just decided to walk home. Though he couldn't see any sane parent letting their child walk home in this weather.  
他急匆匆地回到客厅，惊讶地发现她已经打开了电视，正懒洋洋地躺在沙发垫上。也许什么都没发生，她只是决定自己走回家。尽管他无法想象有哪个理智的家长会让孩子在这样的天气里独自走回家。

"Here," he mumbled while holding out the cup to her.  
"给，" 他咕哝着，将杯子递给她。

"Oh...thanks." "哦……谢谢。"

Taking it from his hands she immediately took a large swig and immediately burned her tongue.  
她从他手中接过杯子，立刻猛喝一口，随即烫到了舌头。

"Ahhhh! Hot!" "啊！好烫！"

"What'd you expect, lukewarm?"  
"你以为会是什么，温温的吗？"

"...Shut it." "……闭嘴。"

"Before I even thinking about keeping quiet I want to know exactly what happened today. Why did you suddenly decide to talk to your father? Its not certainly not because you mis-"  
"在我考虑保持沉默之前，我想确切地知道今天发生了什么。你为什么突然决定和你父亲谈话？这肯定不是因为你误——"

"Don't say it!" "别说了！"

"Do you?" "你真的知道吗？"

"...I don't know! Stop bothering me, damn it!"  
"...我不知道！别烦我了，该死！"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

Asuka turned slowly towards Shinji as he sat down on the couch next to her.  
明日香缓缓转向真嗣，他正坐在她旁边的沙发上。

"Are you...lonely?" "你...感到孤独吗？"

"Lonely? Tch, as if thats something I'd even worry about."  
"孤独？哼，那种事我怎么会在意。"

"You are, aren't you!" "你就是，对吧！"

"No! I'm! Not! Baka!" "不！我！没！有！笨蛋！"

"Damn it! Listen to me Asuka! No, look at me."  
"该死！听我说，明日香！不，看着我。"

Asuka had turned away from him and was now watching the T.V. though not really seeing it.  
明日香已经转过身去，现在正盯着电视，尽管并没有真正在看。

"...I'm not lonely. I don't need help. I don't want help. I can be by myself. I don't need friends. I need only pilot E-"  
"...我不孤单。我不需要帮助。我不想要帮助。我可以一个人。我不需要朋友。我只需要驾驶 E-"

"...Stop...just stop it all ready."  
"...停下...快停下，已经够了。"

Shinji cut her off abruptly by wrapping his arms around her middle. At first she tried to push them away, but finally gave in to his assertion.  
真嗣突然用双臂环抱住她的腰，起初她试图推开，但最终还是屈服于他的坚持。

"...I...didn't want to be alone. ...I wanted to be loved by him again. I wanted to have a family again."  
"...我...不想独自一人。...我想再次被他爱着。我想再次拥有一个家。"

"...Asuka you fool!" "...Asuka 你这个傻瓜！"

Asuka turned her head towards him angry but was silenced as Shinji tightened his grip around her middle.  
Asuka 愤怒地转向他，但当 Shinji 收紧环绕她腰间的手臂时，她沉默了。

"Idiot! What am I and Misato then? Coworkers? Look at who's around you. Touji, Kensuke, Hikari, Ritsuko...me and Misato. What are we to you? Aren't we friends? Even Ayanami is your friend."  
"笨蛋！那我和 Misato 算什么？同事吗？看看你周围的人。Touji、Kensuke、Hikari、Ritsuko...还有我和 Misato。我们对你来说算什么？难道不是朋友吗？就连 Ayanami 也是你的朋友。"

Asuka scoffed lightly at the mention of Rei's name. She wasn't sure if she would ever be able to have a conversation with her and enjoy it. But she was starting to understand what Shinji was talking about.  
听到丽名字时，明日香轻蔑地哼了一声。她不确定自己是否能和丽进行一次愉快的对话。但她开始明白真嗣所说的意思了。

"...Asuka...that father of yours could never understand the friendship that everybody has formed with you. So what if you don't have a proper family! I don't either! But I'm able to continue because I have you, Misato, and everybody else by my side. I use to hate everybody...because nobody loved me. I wanted everybody to just disappear so I'd never have to related to anybody else. But, I learned that that was just to painful. ...If everybody was to leave...I don't want to go back to what I once was."  
"...明日香...你父亲永远无法理解大家与你建立的友谊。没有完整的家庭又怎样！我也没有！但我能继续前行，因为有你、美里和大家在我身边。我曾经恨过所有人...因为没有人爱我。我希望所有人都消失，这样我就不必再与任何人产生联系。但后来我明白，那样太痛苦了。...如果大家都离开...我不想回到过去的样子。"

"...Shin-" "...真-

"So don't leave! Don't leave with that bastard! Stay here with everybody and continue enjoying your life here! Where you belong!"  
"所以别走！别跟那个混蛋走！留在这里和大家一起，继续享受你的生活！这才是你该在的地方！"

"...Shin-ji..." "...真嗣..."

Breathing heavily after unleashing his pent up thoughts since he knew that Asuka might be leaving, he unwrapped his arms around her middle and turned the opposite direction.  
在发泄了自从得知明日香可能离开后积压已久的情绪后，他重重地喘着气，松开了环绕在她腰间的手臂，转向了相反的方向。

"So don't leave...ever..."  
"所以不要离开...永远..."

"..."

"Now...why were you outside in the freezing rain, because if it has anything to do with that bastard I'm gonna-"  
"现在...你为什么在外面冰冷的雨中，如果和那个混蛋有关，我就要-"

"Its not what you think. It was my decision to be out there."  
"不是你想的那样。在外面是我自己的决定。"

"But why were yo-" "但为什么你——"

"...Because of my father."  
"……因为我的父亲。"

"Then it is his-" "那么这是他的——"

"Shut it for a minute and let me talk."  
"闭嘴一会儿，让我说。"

"...Fine..." "...好吧..."

"...Okay so I was somewhat glad that I was able to talk to him again. I hadn't talked to him for five years so of course I was happy. He took me out to lunch in his new Mercedes and we went shopping afterwards. Overall I had a good time. Then though he started talking about how he wanted to see me more, like bringing me back with him to Germany. I told him that it was impossible since I was to heavily involved with Nerv here. He said that I could just work at the German branch."  
"...好吧，我很高兴能再次和他交谈。我已经五年没和他说过话了，所以当然我很开心。他带我去他的新奔驰车里吃午饭，然后我们去购物。总的来说，我过得很愉快。但后来他开始谈论他想多见我，比如带我回德国。我告诉他这不可能，因为我在这里与 Nerv 有很深的牵扯。他说我可以在德国分部工作。"

"After that things started to go down hill. It was obvious that he wanted to spend more time with me...but I just wasn't ready for that. After everything that he had done how could I be? Though what really pissed me off was when he introduced me to his new wife. I felt like I was looking at my dead mother."  
"自那以后，事情就开始走下坡路。很明显，他想花更多时间和我在一起...但我还没准备好。经历了那么多，我怎么可能准备好呢？真正让我恼火的是，他把我介绍给了他的新妻子。我感觉像是在看我已故的母亲。"

Shinji opened his mouth, but closed it quickly. He could guess where this was going.  
真嗣张开嘴，但很快又闭上了。他猜到这会往哪儿发展了。

"In short, she looked so much like my mother that it was disgusting. He wasn't happy enough that he had me, his daughter, the splitting image of my mother. He had to go and fuck around with other woman, and I know they were fucking as she was pregnant...four months she has."  
"简而言之，她长得太像我母亲了，令人作呕。他有了我，他的女儿，和我母亲如出一辙还不够。他还要和其他女人鬼混，我知道他们在鬼混，因为她怀孕了...已经四个月了。"

A small silence appeared at her words in which Shinji wasn't sure if he should talk or remain quiet.  
她的话语间出现了一小段沉默，这让真嗣不确定自己是该说话还是保持安静。

"After learning that I'd be living with a woman that looked exactly like my mother and a child that would look the same, I decided I had had enough. My fathers personality had not changed in those five years. He may not have touched a bottle of beer in years but he was still the same selfish bastard that I hated. I left them. And guess what? He'd didn't even bother looking for me. He was to busy talking with his new wife about what the baby's bedroom was going to be like and whether it was a boy or a girl. He didn't even care in the end about the daughter that he already had."  
在得知我将和一个长得和我母亲一模一样的女人以及一个长相相似的孩子一起生活后，我决定我受够了。我父亲的个性在这五年里丝毫未变。他可能多年未沾啤酒，但依然是我所憎恨的那个自私的混蛋。我离开了他们。你猜怎么着？他甚至都没费心找过我。他忙着和他的新妻子讨论婴儿房的布置，以及孩子是男是女。最终，他连自己已有的女儿都不在乎了。

Shinji digested everything in his mind, but the same thing still came out. Her father had abandoned her once again.  
真嗣在心中消化着这一切，但结论依旧不变。她的父亲再次抛弃了她。

"...Its unforgivable," he whispered.  
"...这是不可原谅的，"他低声说道。

"I don't care anymore. I'm done with him. If he comes crawling back to me this time I'll kick him in the crotch and tell him to get the fuck out of my sight."  
"我再也不在乎了。我受够他了。如果这次他爬回来求我，我会一脚踢在他裤裆上，叫他滚出我的视线。"

"Good...he deserves it." "好...他活该。"

"...Ah I'm tired now, after all this talking."  
"...啊，说了这么多，现在累了。"

"Well, your futon is in your room again."  
"对了，你的被褥已经放回你房间了。"

"Speaking of my room, what made you think you had the right to help me dress?"  
"说到我的房间，你凭什么觉得有权帮我更衣？"

"...That was because you didn't seem capable!"  
"...那是因为你看起来没那个能力！"

"Whether I was or not, doesn't matter. Pervert!"  
"我是不是，并不重要。变态！"

"God your so-" "天啊，你真是——"

The front door opened. 前门打开了。

Shinji and Asuka both turned their heads towards the sound of the door and heard the shuffling of feet across the wooden floor.  
真嗣和明日香同时转向门口的声响，听到了脚步在木地板上拖动的声音。

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Oh Shinji I'm so glad that you're here...Oh Asuka good your here also. Listen we have a problem."  
“哦，真嗣，我真高兴你在这里……哦，明日香，太好了，你也来了。听着，我们有个问题。”

"What?" "什么？"

"Well...while walking back to the apartment from my car...I-I met Asuka's father."  
"嗯...从车里走回公寓的路上...我...我遇到了明日香的爸爸。"

Shinji felt Asuka's entire body seize up next to him and instinctively reached out and grabbed ahold of the hand closest to him.  
真嗣感觉到明日香整个人在他身边僵住了，本能地伸出手，抓住了离他最近的那只手。

"What did you say," whispered Shinji?  
"你说了什么？" 真嗣低声问道。

"Asuka's father is outside the front door and demanding to see Asuka. He said something like he's taking her away, and that she's better off not staying here anymore. Hang on...I'll contact Nerv and get him arrested-"  
"明日香的父亲在前门外面，要求见明日香。他说什么要带她走，还说她最好别再待在这里了。等等……我联系 Nerv 让他被逮捕——"

"No...I'll take care of this," whispered Shinji calmly. His voice held venom in it.  
"不……我来处理，" 碇真嗣平静地低语。他的声音中带着毒意。

"Shinji he's an adult. What do you plan to do?"  
"真嗣，他是个成年人。你打算怎么做？"

"...What I should have done yesterday."  
"...昨天我应该做的事。"

"SHINJI WAIT!" "真嗣，等等！"

Standing up hurriedly before Misato could stop him, he didn't even realize that Asuka was still holding firmly onto his hand. So before he knew that she was next to him, as he was opening the front door.  
在美里阻止他之前匆忙站起来，他甚至没有意识到明日香还紧紧抓着他的手。所以在打开前门之前，他并不知道她就在他身边。

"About time," said a snarling voice.  
"终于来了，"一个咆哮的声音说道。

Shinji froze. No...it wasn't.  
真嗣僵住了。不...不是的。

Reality was to cruel. 现实太过残酷。

Shinji was looking back at the subject of his nightmares for the last week.  
真嗣正回望着过去一周里他噩梦的源头。

Asuka's father had a long, tan, overcoat on over the slacks and dress-shirt that he was wearing. In addition he had a hat on, pulled low over his eyes, so that Shinji could only see the whites of his eyes in the lack of light. His dreams had finally come to fruition. How could he have been so stupid to not realize this sooner?  
明日香的父亲穿着一条长长的、棕褐色的风衣，里面是裤子和衬衫。此外，他还戴着一顶帽子，帽檐压得很低，遮住了眼睛，以至于真嗣只能在昏暗的光线中看到他眼白的部分。他的梦境终于变成了现实。他怎么会这么愚蠢，没有早点意识到这一点呢？

Taking a rather hesitant step backwards, he felt pressure on his left hand and looked around to see Asuka leaning up against him, with both her hands holding onto his. It seemed to give him new strength as he glared murderously back at his enemy. With the blooding pounding in his ears, and his entire body shaking angrily, he managed to get out a few simple words.  
他有些犹豫地后退了一步，感觉到左手上的压力，转头一看，发现明日香正靠在他身上，双手紧握着他的手。这似乎给了他新的力量，他凶狠地瞪向他的敌人。随着耳中血液的轰鸣声，全身因愤怒而颤抖，他勉强挤出了几个简单的词。

"Leave. Asuka doesn't want to stay with you."  
"离开。明日香不想和你待在一起。"

"I think thats my decision and no one else's, kid."  
"我认为这是我的决定，不是其他任何人的，小鬼。"

"No...you're wrong. Its Asuka's decision above all else. And she has decided to stay here."  
"不...你错了。这是明日香的决定，最重要的是她的决定。而她已经决定留在这里。"

"I'm her father! I make the rules! And I'm telling her to return with me to Germany!"  
"我是她父亲！我制定规则！我命令她跟我回德国！"

Shinji felt Asuka shiver next to him and had to restrain himself from not breaking her father in half.  
真嗣感觉到身边的明日香在颤抖，他不得不克制自己不去把她的父亲撕成两半。

"I'll say it again. Leave."  
"我再说一遍。离开。"

"And I'm saying that I don't take orders from a kid like you! You will return my daughter to me-"  
"我说的就是你这样的小鬼没资格命令我！你必须把我女儿还给我——"

"Father!" "爸爸！"

Shinji and Asuka's father both turned their heads to the strong voice of the frightened girl clutching her friends hand.  
真嗣和明日香的爸爸都转向了那个害怕的女孩，她紧紧抓着朋友的手，声音坚定。

"I'm no longer your daughter. You don't have one. You lost the privilege to call me your daughter a long time ago. Leave! I don't want to have to listen to your sniveling bitching anymore."  
“我不再是你的女儿了。你没有女儿。你很久以前就失去了叫我女儿的资格。走开！我不想再听你那哭哭啼啼的抱怨了。”

Asuka's father was rendered speechless for a minute before lashing out in anger. His face twisted into a sickening grimace as he retorted, "Tch, spoiled brat. Fine be that way. Stay here for all I care, I never cared for you anyway. In the end you're just like your mother. A slu-"  
明日香的父亲一时语塞，随后愤怒地爆发了。他的脸扭曲成一副令人作呕的鬼脸，反驳道：“哼，被宠坏的小鬼。随你便吧。我根本不在乎你，你爱待在这儿就待着。说到底，你和你妈一个样。一个贱——”

...Snap... ...啪...

Shinji's fist collided directly against the side of his face, instantly shattering his jaw, and connecting with his temple. His bottom and lower jaw overlapped each other quickly with the sound of two rocks being ground together. His lower jaw unhinged from the top and seemed to dangle their effortlessly, tearing apart the bottom lip and ripping the roots of his teeth out in the process. Blood spewed forth from his opened mouth as the top part of jaw bit down on his tongue, ripping off a piece of it in the process. The slimy substance slid out of his mouth and onto the ground. The force of Shinji's blow had even broken apart some of the cartilage in his noes, making him bleed from the nostrils.  
真嗣的拳头直接撞上了他的脸颊，瞬间击碎了他的下颌，并击中了他的太阳穴。他的下颌和下巴迅速重叠，发出两块石头摩擦般的声音。下颌从上颚脱臼，似乎毫不费力地悬挂着，撕裂了下唇，并在过程中拔出了牙齿的根部。血液从他张开的嘴里喷涌而出，上颚部分咬住了舌头，撕下了一块。这种黏滑的物质从他嘴里滑出，落在了地上。真嗣这一击的力量甚至破坏了他鼻子里的一些软骨，使他鼻孔流血。

Above all else it was the hit to the temple that seemed to do the most damage. Shinji had swung with all his might and had struck a part of the human body that was...rather sensitive. He blacked out almost instantly as the blow to the cranial lobes made blood drip from the ears. The blow had additionally cracked part of the skull.  
最重要的是，击中太阳穴的那一拳似乎造成了最大的伤害。真嗣全力以赴地挥拳，击中了人体一个相当敏感的部位。他几乎立刻就昏迷了，因为对大脑皮层的打击使得血液从耳朵里滴落。这一击还导致了部分头骨的裂开。

The entire thing transpired in less then three seconds as Shinji struck and now looked down at the man which he wondered if he had just killed. A pool of blood was slowly starting to from beneath him and the smell of it was already starting to linger in the air.  
整个过程不到三秒钟，真嗣一击即中，现在正低头看着那个男人，心中疑惑自己是否刚刚夺去了他的生命。一滩血迹正慢慢在他身下形成，血的气味已经开始在空气中弥漫。

Shinji felt a strong throbbing sensation in his hand and looked down to see that he had split open the knuckles in his right hand; the one he had swung with.  
真嗣感到手上传来一阵剧烈的刺痛，低头一看，发现自己右手的指节已经裂开；正是他挥拳的那只手。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

Shinji wheeled around to see a wide eyed Asuka looking at him while Misato had her mouth wide open behind her.  
真嗣转身看到明日香瞪大了眼睛盯着他，而美里则在她身后张大了嘴巴。

"...Sorry...I couldn't let him talk about you like that. He deserved it."  
"...对不起...我不能让他那样说你。他活该。"

"Shinji," said an exasperated Misato. "You might have killed him."  
"真嗣，"美里无奈地说，"你可能会杀了他。"

"He'd deserve it." His words were ice.  
"他活该。"他的话语冷若冰霜。"

Rushing over to the man laying on the ground, Misato grabbed his wrist and managed to find a weak pulse.  
米萨托冲向躺在地上的男子，抓住他的手腕，设法找到了微弱的脉搏。

"He's alive." “他还活着。”

"I'll fix that really quick," mumbled Shinji as he walked over to the almost dead man, but something grabbed onto his wrists.  
“我马上解决这个问题，”真嗣咕哝着走向濒死的男子，但有什么东西抓住了他的手腕。

Turning around he saw Asuka had one hand on his wrist, while the other was resting on his shoulder.  
他转过身，看到明日香一手抓着他的手腕，另一只手则搭在他的肩膀上。

"Its enough. He'll be lucky to be able to talk after this. I don't want you to have to go to jail because of something like this. He won't go to jail? Will he, Misato?"  
“够了。他这次能说话就算幸运了。我不想你因为这种事进监狱。他不会进监狱吧？会吗，美里？”

"No, he shouldn't. I'll arrange stuff with Nerv and have them claim it was self defense. Considering your fathers record, it'll be believable. Though Shinji...what you did...I still can't-"  
“不，他不会。我会和 NERV 那边协调，让他们宣称这是自卫。考虑到你父亲的记录，这会让人信服。不过，真嗣……你做的事……我还是无法……”

"I'll listen to it later."  
"我稍后再听。"

Turning around, Shinji walked by a wordless Asuka, and walked into his own room before sliding the door closed.  
转身后，真嗣从沉默的明日香身边走过，走进自己的房间，然后滑上了门。

Misato eyed the door heavily before looking back at the man on the ground. Shinji seemed to be showing more signs of aggression lately, making her wonder if piloting Eva Unit 01 was creating these mood swings.  
美里沉重地看了一眼门，然后回头看向躺在地上的男人。真嗣最近似乎表现出更多的攻击性迹象，这让她怀疑驾驶 EVA 初号机是否导致了这些情绪波动。

Really, he needed to learn to grow up.  
真的，他需要学会长大。

---

Shinji rolled over onto his side. His clock read midnight.  
真嗣翻身侧躺着。他的时钟显示是午夜。

Rolling back around he had a sudden urge to vomit. He had just been reliving the nights events, and was still surprised that he had almost killed Asuka's father. He could remember the feel of his fist as it collided with the side of his head and the feeling the as skull as it cracked. It still sent a shiver down his spine. Against all his willpower he had still resorted to violence. Sure he had thought of it, but had never really intended on beating the shit out of him. Even so, he would have done it again most likely, because of what he had said to Asuka.  
他又翻了个身，突然有种想吐的感觉。他刚刚还在重温那晚的事件，仍然惊讶于自己差点杀了明日香的父亲。他记得拳头击中他头部侧面的感觉，以及头骨破裂时的触感。这仍让他脊背发凉。尽管他极力克制，但还是诉诸了暴力。当然，他曾想过，但从未真正打算把他打得半死。即便如此，他很可能会再次这么做，因为他说了那些对明日香的话。

Earlier that night, just before Shinji dropped off to sleep, he remembered Misato talking through his door. She said that Asuka's father had been taken to a Nerv hospital and examined. In order to repair his jaw he would need screws inserted into the bone to hold his jaw in place, not that it would do any good in the first place. The blow to the cranial lobes had apparently done some damage to his brain. All he could do so far was drool and shit himself; talking seemed next to impossible. Big change from the man that was once a big CEO just a few hours ago.  
那天晚上早些时候，就在真嗣即将入睡之际，他记得美里透过他的门说话。她说明日香的爸爸被送到了 NERV 的医院接受检查。为了修复他的下颌，需要将螺丝植入骨头以固定，但这从一开始就没什么用。头部受到的打击显然对他的大脑造成了损伤。到目前为止，他只能流口水和失禁；说话似乎几乎不可能。就在几小时前，他还是一位大公司的 CEO，变化真是巨大。

Well, he considered himself lucky. If he really had killed the man, he didn't think Misato would even be able to gloss over it. She had already spent some time (and money) creating eye witnesses that would testify in court if they had to, saying that it was all self defense.  
好吧，他觉得自己还算幸运。如果他真的杀了那个人，他认为美里甚至无法掩盖这一点。她已经花了一些时间（和金钱）制造目击者，如果需要的话，他们会在法庭上作证，说这一切都是自卫。

He should be happy, but he wasn't. He didn't think that anything productive had come out of his paralyzing a person. He was even slightly worried that Asuka might be mad at him. Above all else he hoped this last part wasn't true.  
他应该感到高兴，但他没有。他不认为让一个人瘫痪有什么积极的结果。他甚至有点担心明日香可能会生他的气。最重要的是，他希望这最后一点不是真的。

"I really screwed up," he mumbled into the night.  
"我真的搞砸了," 他对着夜色喃喃自语。

Sighing heavily he turned around, and laid on his stomach with is head resting under the pillow. He was just thinking about turning his SDAT on and forgetting everything when something surprised him.  
他重重地叹了口气，转过身来，趴在床上，头枕在枕头下。他正想着打开 SDAT，忘掉一切，这时有什么东西让他吃了一惊。

He heard the door sliding open.  
他听到门滑开了。

In his desperate attempt to scramble around to see who it was, he heard somebody hissing through the small gap in the open door.  
在他拼命四处张望试图看清是谁时，他听到有人透过敞开的门缝小声嘶嘶地说着。

"Don't move...don't say anything."  
“别动……什么都别说。”

The voice almost made him yell.  
那声音几乎让他尖叫出声。

"Asu-"

"Quiet, baka." "安静点，笨蛋。"

He blinked several times to try to see any sign of her outline behind the door, but it was just to dark.  
他眨了几次眼，试图在门后看到她的轮廓，但实在太暗了。

After an abrupt silence, Asuka spoke up. "Hey...is it okay if I stay here for a while?"  
在一阵突如其来的沉默后，明日香开口了。"嘿...我可以在这里待一会儿吗？"

"I thought you didn't want me to say anything," Shinji mumbled.  
"我以为你不想让我说什么的，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"...What?" "...什么？"

"Nothing. ...Do as you please."  
"没什么。...随你便吧。"

"Hmm. K'ay." “嗯，可以。”

Shinji rolled back the other way then and closed his eyes. It's not like she needed his permission if she wanted to stay outside his door.  
真嗣翻了个身，闭上了眼睛。她要是想待在他门外，也不需要他的允许。

He completely misunderstood her intensions and realized too late as she slid the door open all the way.  
他完全误解了她的意图，等她把门完全拉开时，他才意识到这一点。

"Wha-What are you?" "你...你是什么人？"

Before he was able to turn around, he heard a soft thud land next to him and felt something soft brush up against his back briefly. Next he heard the rearranging of blankets and realized that she had been way too prepared with her own blanket and pillow.  
在他来得及转身之前，他听到旁边轻轻的落地声，随即感到有什么柔软的东西短暂地拂过他的背部。接着他听到毯子被重新整理的声音，意识到她对自己的毯子和枕头准备得太过充分了。

"Asuka, what are you do-"  
"明日香，你在做什-"

"Don't look over here...stay facing that way."  
"别往这边看...继续朝那边看。"

"...Okay, but why..." "...好吧，但为什么..."

"...I don't honestly know...I just woke up and found myself walking over here with a blanket and pillow. A-Anyways, d-don't get any weird i-ideas. Now keep quiet, I'm going to sleep."  
"...老实说我也不知道...我一觉醒来就发现自己拿着毯子和枕头走过来了。总之，别有什么奇怪的想法。现在安静点，我要睡觉了。"

"No...but this is..." "不...但这可是..."

"What?" "什么？"

"...Nevermind..." "...算了..."

"Hmph." "哼。"

The two lapsed into silence soon. Only now was Shinji self-conscious of what was going on. He was sharing a futon with Asuka. Every guy in his class would give an arm and a leg for this opportunity. He had know idea if she was lonely or what, but was relieved that she still appeared to be on speaking terms with him. But something still nagged at the back of his mind.  
两人很快陷入了沉默。直到现在，真嗣才意识到发生了什么。他和明日香共用一床被褥。班上的每个男生都会为了这个机会不惜一切。他不知道她是否感到孤独，还是别的什么，但令他松了一口气的是，她似乎仍愿意与他交谈。然而，他心中仍有一丝不安挥之不去。

Disobeying her demands he rolled over to look at her and sucked in his breath as he realized he was a mere centimeter away from kissing her. It would have been funny if one of them had sneezed at that point. Asuka appeared to have expected something like this and was obviously waiting for him to do exactly what he just did. Though she didn't seem at all put off that they had almost kissed, rather, she seemed to be enjoying the close contact.  
无视她的要求，他翻身面向她，意识到自己距离吻她仅差一厘米时，不禁倒吸了一口气。如果当时有人打喷嚏，那可真是滑稽。明日香似乎预料到了这种情况，显然是在等他做出刚刚的举动。尽管他们差点接吻，她却丝毫没有感到不悦，反而似乎很享受这种近距离接触。

"So? You want to say something right?"  
“所以？你想说什么吧？”

Shinji turned his head the other way so he was able to breath again.  
真嗣把头转向另一边，这才得以重新呼吸。

"Well, yeah," he muttered.  
"嗯，是啊，" 他咕哝道。

"So what is it?" "那到底是什么？"

"...Are you mad at me."  
"...你在生我的气吗。"

"...Huh? What kind of a question is that? Why would I be mad?"  
"...嗯？这是什么问题？我为什么要生气？"

"...For what I did to your father."  
"...因为我对你父亲所做的事。"

"What, almost killing him? Course I'm not. He deserved it and this means I never have to worry about him again. I should be thanking you."  
"什么，差点杀了他？当然不生气。他活该，这意味着我再也不用担心他了。我应该感谢你。"

"...He still is your father though."  
"...但他仍然是你的父亲。"

"Tch, I don't have a father. I've got friends, a guardian...and you."  
"哼，我没有父亲。我有朋友，有监护人...还有你。"

Shinji didn't quite understand why he wasn't included in the friends category.  
真嗣不太明白为什么自己没有被归入朋友那一类。

"Were you worried about something so trivial as that."  
"你居然会为这么琐碎的事担心。"

"...Yeah." "...嗯。"

"Huh...you can be really stupid sometimes. Forget it. I'm not mad...and being here should clarify that."  
"哼...你有时真是蠢得可以。算了，我没生气...待在这里应该能说明一切。"

"I suppose thats true." "我想那是真的。"

"Don't expect this to happen again."  
"别指望这种事会再发生。"

"I never even expected it to happen once."  
"我甚至从未期待过它会发生一次。"

"Liar." "骗子。"

"Fine, Fine. I dream about this all the time. Happy?"  
"好吧，好吧。我总是梦到这个。满意了？"

"Not particularly. Now quiet already. If you can't sleep then go on the couch. I don't want you to be tossing and turning only to wake me up."  
"并不特别满意。现在安静点。如果你睡不着就去沙发上。我不想你翻来覆去把我吵醒。"

'Who was the one that woke who up again?' Shinji thought in his head.  
'又是谁把谁叫醒的来着？' 真嗣在心里想着。

"Anyways...night Shinji..."  
"总之...晚安，真嗣..."

"Oh...night." "哦...晚安。"

In the end...he wasn't able to sleep...and passed the rest of the night away listening to his SDAT. Asuka slept the night away in his room, tightly wrapped in Shinji's blankets.  
最终...他无法入睡...整夜都在听着他的 SDAT。明日香在他的房间里沉沉睡去，紧紧裹着真嗣的毯子。

**I had a lot of fun typing this chapter because its been in my head, floating around, since the start of summer. I have a strong hatred for rapists and guys that abuse woman in general. I guess I let my own feelings sorta flow out from Shinji in this chapter. I can honestly say that I could not be unbiased if I was asked to preside as a juror at a rapist trial.  
我打这一章时玩得很开心，因为从夏天开始，它就在我脑海中飘来飘去。我非常憎恨强奸犯和那些虐待女性的男人。我想我在这章中让真嗣流露出了我自己的情感。老实说，如果让我担任强奸案的陪审员，我无法保持公正。**

**P.S. I'm posting this at a Home Depot.  
附：我正在家得宝发布这个。**

### Chapter 10: Reality
**I'd just like to take a brief moment to thank everyone that has an interest in this story. While I enjoy reviews it still blows my mind that over 60+ people receive emails every time I post a new chapter. Not to mention those story stats can get really high. Arigatoo Gozaimasu Minna!  
我想借此短暂时刻感谢所有对这部作品感兴趣的人。虽然我喜欢评论，但每次发布新章节时，有超过 60 人收到电子邮件，这仍然让我感到不可思议。更不用说那些故事统计数据可以变得非常高。非常感谢大家！**

**Anyways much shorter then my last few chapters, only around 6k words. These next chapters are going to be fun to write as some more things about Shinji start to come out in the open. Also I'd figured I'd let everyone that reads this know that I'm splitting my time between this and my Negima story. So I'll right a chapter of this and then right a chapter of Negi and so on and so forth. Not likely that I'll get around to working on this till November now. Anyway enjoy.  
无论如何，这一章比我的前几章短得多，只有大约 6000 字。接下来的几章将会很有趣，因为关于真嗣的一些事情将开始浮出水面。另外，我想让所有读者知道，我正在这部作品和《魔法老师》之间分配时间。所以我会写一章这个，然后写一章《魔法老师》，如此循环。现在不太可能在这之前开始写这个了。总之，请享受阅读。**

Gendo Ikari sat at his desk with a large manilla envelope in front of him. Namely the medical report on Asuka's father which he had received after hearing about the incident. It was early in the morning; a little over five hours since Asuka's father had been admitted to the Nerv hospital, and the artificial light from the Geofront was just starting to lighten up the darkness in Gendo Ikari's office.  
碇源堂坐在他的办公桌前，面前放着一个大号的马尼拉信封。正是关于明日香父亲的医疗报告，他在得知事故后收到的。时间尚早，距离明日香父亲被送进 NERV 医院不过五小时有余，地底都市的人工光线刚刚开始驱散碇源堂办公室内的黑暗。

Looking down again at the envelop he frowned and wondered if he could use this happenstance to his advantage. While he couldn't say that he approved of Asuka's father, he couldn't help but feel that the man had furthered his designs.  
他再次低头看着信封，皱起眉头，思索是否能利用这一偶然事件为自己谋利。虽然他不能说赞同明日香的父亲，但他不禁觉得此人推进了他的计划。

At that moment his friend, Kozo Fuyutsuki stepped into his office.  
就在这时，他的朋友，富士树久走进了他的办公室。

"So? Did anything happen?"  
“所以？有什么事发生吗？”

"...From what Doctor Akagi has sent me, there doesn't seem to be any sign of contamination."  
“……从赤木博士传来的消息来看，似乎没有污染的迹象。”

Kozo let out a sigh of relief. After a slight pause he asked, "How is Seele going to interpret this?"  
惣流松了一口气。稍作停顿后，他问道：“Seele 会如何解读这一点？”

"...They shouldn't have any suspicions. I have made sure of that."  
"...他们不应该有任何疑虑。我已经确保了这一点。"

"...I wonder..." "...我在想..."

"You doubt me?" "你怀疑我？"

"No. Just that based on what Inspector Kaji has reported, it doesn't exist."  
"不，只是根据加治检察官的报告，它并不存在。"

"There was always the possibility of that. The Dead Sea scrolls were written by humans after all, and humans have a habit of making mistakes."  
"这种情况总是有可能的。毕竟死海古卷是由人类书写的，而人类总免不了犯错。"

"Seele might looked into him more."  
"Seele 或许应该对他进行更深入的调查。"

"As I have said I have taken appropriated measures over the years to avoid that. They only look at him and see a disposable pilot."  
"正如我所说，多年来我已采取了适当的措施来避免这种情况。他们只看他一眼，就认为他是个可随意替换的飞行员。"

"Which is valuable to us."  
"这对我们来说很有价值。"

"...Correct." "……没错。"

With a sigh, Kozo left his standing position and walked over to the large windows that barely generated any of the artificial sunlight.  
叹了口气，Kozo 离开了站立的位置，走向那些几乎不产生任何人造阳光的大型窗户。

"...Sometimes I wonder if Yui would approve of what we are doing."  
“……有时候我在想，Yui 会不会赞同我们所做的事情。”

After a slight pause, Gendo said, "Yui wished for the future that we are building. Instrumentality will be complete and people shall change."  
稍作停顿后，Gendo 说道：“Yui 希望我们建设未来。人类补完计划将会完成，人们将会改变。”

"But people don't enjoy change. They prefer things to stay the same so that it doesn't interrupt their daily routine. They become used to normality"  
"但人们不喜欢改变。他们希望事物保持不变，以免打乱他们的日常生活。他们习惯了常态"

"...They wont have a choice in the matter."  
"...他们在这件事上没有选择。"

"...Do you really think Shinji will agree to this though?"  
"...你真的认为真嗣会同意这样做吗？"

"...Eventually he will realize the need for Instrumentality. It is impossible for humans to understand each other any other way."  
"...最终他会意识到实行‘工具化’的必要性。人类不可能通过其他方式相互理解。"

Turning away from the windows, Kozo asked, "What do you plan to do now though? With this latest incident even Shinji must be starting to feel a change in himself."  
转过身来，Kozo 问道：“那么现在你打算怎么办？经历了最近的事件，即使是真嗣也开始感觉到自己内心的变化了吧。”

"...That is true. When Doctor Akagi sent me the medical files related to Asuka's father, she determined that the velocity of Shinji's punch was well above that of a normal humans. She called it abnormal."  
"...确实如此。当赤木博士将有关明日香父亲的医疗文件发给我时，她发现真嗣那一拳的速度远超常人。她称之为异常。"

"...That explains a lot."  
"...这就解释了很多。"

"We will have to start examining his thought patterns. See if there are any differences between his and another humans. We will include them in the synchronization tests. Tell Doctor Akagi that she is to oversee this herself. Let no one else know about it."  
"我们必须开始研究他的思维模式。看看他与普通人类有何不同。我们将把他们纳入同步测试中。告诉赤城博士，她要亲自负责这项工作。不得让其他人知道。"

"Very well." "很好。"

"...One more thing Fuyutsuki..."  
"...还有一件事，冬月副司令..."

"Hmmm?" He said as he turned around.  
"嗯？" 他转过身来说道。

"...Let Doctor Akagi know that we are testing the dummy plugs later."  
"...告诉赤木博士，我们稍后将测试模拟插入栓。"

"Understood." “明白了。”

After Kozo had left the room, Gendo leaned back in his chair and looked at another file that was next to the medical report. Picking it up he leafed through it quickly to the photo he wanted and settled on the picture of Shinji Ikari being held by his mother. No emotion was held in his eyes as he looked down at his so called son.  
在薰离开房间后，源堂靠回椅背，目光转向旁边的一份文件，那是与医疗报告相邻的另一份资料。他拿起文件，迅速翻到想要的照片页，定格在一张真嗣被母亲抱着的画面上。他的眼神中没有流露出任何情感，只是冷冷地俯视着这个所谓的儿子。

---

Shinji wasn't sure if it was the yelling in his ear that had woken him or the pounding headache that he felt, still, both of them felt the same. Squinting his eyes open, he pulled the earbuds out of his ears and rolled over to see Asuka frowning at him while tapping her finger silently against her arm.  
真嗣不确定是耳边的吼声还是那阵剧烈的头痛唤醒了他，但两者给他的感觉如出一辙。他眯着眼睛睁开，拔出耳塞，翻身看到明日香正皱着眉头，手指无声地敲打着自己的手臂。

"Well?" "那么？"

Shinji, not in the mood to be toyed around with her this early in the morning stubbornly said back, "Well what?"  
一大早就被她戏弄，真嗣心情不佳地固执回道：“那又怎样？”

"Are you stupid. Breakfast."  
“你是不是傻，早餐啊。”

"Oh that," Shinji mumbled as he rolled back over.  
“哦，那个啊，”真嗣咕哝着翻了个身。

"Get off the couch already and move. We have school today, remember?"  
"快从沙发上起来，动一动。我们今天还要上学，记得吗？"

"Not today you don't." "今天你不用去了。"

Asuka, and a rather reluctant Shinji both turned to see Misato standing in the doorway of the living room.  
明日香，还有相当不情愿的真嗣，两人都转向客厅门口，看到美里站在那里。

"Why don't we have school?"  
“为什么我们不上学？”

"I got a call early this morning that Ritsuko wants you two and Rei to come in for tests."  
“今天一大早，律子打电话来说要你们俩和丽去进行测试。”

"Uhhhhh." “呃……”

"Come on its not that bad Asuka."  
"来吧，明日香，没那么糟糕。"

"Its not that I'm mad about not going to school...but...because of last night."  
"不是因为不能去学校生气...而是...因为昨晚的事。"

"...I tried explaining that to Ritsuko but she said that the order came directly from commander Ikari. So no exceptions."  
"...我试图向律子解释，但她说是碇司令直接下的命令。所以没有例外。"

"Fine, fine. I got it."  
"好了，好了。我明白了。"

Turning back to Shinji, she said, "Here that? No school. Should be glad."  
她转回身对真嗣说：“听到了吗？不用上学。应该高兴才对。”

"Yes I'm grateful that instead of sitting in a stuffy classroom I get to sit in a twenty foot capsule that smells like blood."  
“是的，我很感激不用坐在闷热的教室里，而是坐在一个二十英尺长、充满血腥味的驾驶舱里。”

"...Don't have to get so upset about it."  
"...没必要为此这么生气。"

"Fine, I'm getting up." "好吧，我起床了。"

"Good. I'm hungry." "好。我饿了。"

"So I've heard." "我听说了。"

Falling off the couch, Shinji was surprised when Asuka put out a helping hand to him. Excepting it somewhat hesitantly, he stood up slowly with his hand in Asuka's. It was then that he remembered last night and how he had ended up on the couch. Though it was his decision in the first place. Glancing at Asuka he realized that he was now standing and let go of her hand quickly.  
从沙发上摔下来，真嗣惊讶地看到明日香伸出手来帮他。他有些犹豫地接受了她的帮助，慢慢地站了起来，手还握在明日香的手中。这时，他想起了昨晚自己是如何最终躺在沙发上的。虽然这原本是他的决定。他瞥了一眼明日香，意识到自己已经站起来了，便迅速放开了她的手。

"...What's up? You've got a pained expression on your face."  
"...怎么了？你脸上带着痛苦的表情。"

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

"Yeah, you look like you don't feel too good."  
"是啊，你看起来不太舒服。"

Doing something completely un-Asuka like, she reached up and held her hand against his forehead.  
她做出了一件完全不像明日香会做的事，伸出手来，将手掌贴在他的额头上。

"A-Asuka wh-what are you?"  
"A-明日香，你...你是什么人？"

While having her left hand against Shinji's forehead she put her right hand against her own, checking if there was a difference in temperature.  
她用左手贴在真嗣的额头上，同时用右手贴着自己的额头，检查是否有温差。

"...Well you don't seem to have a fever."  
"...嗯，看来你没有发烧。"

"Of course I don't! I just have a minor headache is all."  
"当然不严重！我只是有点轻微的头疼罢了。"

"Baka. Learn to take better care of yourself."  
"笨蛋。学会更好地照顾自己吧。"

'How can I when I've been stuck taking care of you ever since you got here?'  
“我怎么可能学会呢？自从你来了之后，我就一直被困在照顾你这件事上。”

As Asuka brought her hand back against Shinji's forehead, Shinji happened to steal a glance at Misato and noticed that she had an eyebrow raised and looked like she was about to explode with laughter.  
当明日香将手从真嗣的额头上收回时，真嗣恰好瞥了一眼美里，注意到她挑起了一边的眉毛，看起来马上就要爆笑出声。

"What?" He finally managed to say to her.  
“什么？”他终于对她开口道。

"...You guys looked like a couple just now."  
“……你们刚才看起来真像一对情侣。”

"..."

"Absolutely not!" “绝对不行！”

Only Shinji happened to say this.  
只有真嗣碰巧说了这句话。

Upon realizing that Asuka hadn't said anything, Shinji spun around and faced her. Asuka was looking straight at Misato and was frowning slightly as though wondering what she wanted to say.  
意识到明日香什么也没说，真嗣转过身面对她。明日香直视着美里，微微皱眉，似乎在想她想说什么。

"...I think Shinji's more of a servant actually."  
"...我觉得真嗣其实更像是个仆人。"

Shinji seemed to deflate on the spot. Really, what had he expected? Though it seemed Asuka noticed this sudden change in demeanor and said, "What? Did you think that I'd want you as a boyfriend. As if! That wont even happen in your dreams."  
真嗣似乎当场就泄了气。真的，他还能期待什么呢？不过，似乎明日香注意到了他突然改变的态度，说道：“什么？你以为我会想让你做男朋友。做梦去吧！那种事连你的梦里都不会发生。”

Shinji wasn't able to stop himself and said, "Then what was last night all about!"  
真嗣控制不住自己，说道：“那昨晚又是怎么回事！”

"Sleepwalking," she said simply.  
"梦游，"她简单地说道。

"Sleepwalking? You think everything that happened last night was because of sleep walking!"  
"梦游？你觉得昨晚发生的一切都是因为梦游！"

"Why else would I wake up and find myself in your room?"  
"不然我怎么会醒来时发现自己在你房间里？"

"You're unbelievable!" "你真是不可理喻！"

"You're a pervert!" "你这个变态！"

"We all are going to be in trouble if we don't hurry down to Nerv, right now," murmured Misato while secretly wondering what had happened last night. Her imagination was going overboard.  
"如果我们不赶紧去 Nerv，我们都会遇到麻烦的，""美里低声说道，同时暗自思索昨晚发生了什么。她的想象力已经失控了。"

"...Ah shit." "...该死。"

Hurrying out of the living room, Asuka quickly threw some makeshift clothes on and waited by the door.  
急匆匆地离开客厅，明日香迅速套上几件临时衣物，站在门口等待。

"Hurry it up baka." "快点，笨蛋。"

Hobbling out of his room on one foot, Shinji managed to say back. "Yeah fine. I'm ready."  
单脚跳着走出房间，真嗣勉强回了一句。“嗯，没事。我准备好了。”

Nodding, Asuka opened the door and walked out into he open air.  
点头示意后，明日香打开门，走进了开阔的空气中。

---

No matter how many times he dawned the plug suit, Shinji could never really get quite used to it. Maybe he was just anxious, though with good reason. He had heard beforehand that his father would be specifically supervising this test, and it made him a little uncomfortable. Why would his father choose now of all times to witness a synchronization test? He had never witnessed it any other times.  
无论穿多少次插入栓服，真嗣始终无法完全适应。也许他只是有些紧张，尽管有充分的理由。他事先听说父亲会专门监督这次测试，这让他有些不安。为什么父亲会选择在这个时候来观看同步测试？他以前从未在其他时候见证过。

As Shinji climbed into Unit 01's entry plug he caught a brief glimpse of his father looking at the three Eva's stationed next to each other. A grimace passed over Shinji's face for a brief instance before he ignored it. His father had become an irrelevant object in his life, one that he could readily do without. Sometimes he wondered what was making him pilot Eva. He had no good reason after all.  
当真嗣爬进初号机的插入栓时，他瞥见父亲正注视着并排站立的三台 EVA。真嗣的脸上掠过一丝苦笑，但很快便置之不理。父亲在他的生活中已变得无关紧要，是他可以轻易舍弃的存在。有时他会想，究竟是什么驱使他驾驶 EVA。毕竟，他并没有什么充分的理由。

'Well...maybe thats not entirely correct,' thought Shinji as he glanced over at Asuka who was climbing the ladder to her entry plug. He supposed that he just wanted to protect everybody that was important to him, and Asuka certainly fell into the category.  
“嗯……也许这并不完全正确，”真嗣想着，目光转向正在攀爬梯子进入插入栓的明日香。他想，他只是想保护所有对他重要的人，而明日香无疑属于这一类。

"Okay you three, we're gonna start the test. Just perform like you usually do," said Misato from the control room.  
“好了，你们三个，我们即将开始测试。就像平常那样表现，”从控制室传来美里的话。

"This time you better take us out for dinner," mumbled Asuka.  
"这次你最好带我们出去吃晚饭，"明日香咕哝道。

"Why bother, Shinji's cooking tastes better then anything I could pay for anyway."  
"何必呢，真嗣做的饭比我能花钱买到的任何东西都好吃。"

Asuka was silent at Misato's words. She didn't want to have to admit it, even though she was likely right.  
明日香在美里的话中沉默了。她不想承认这一点，尽管美里很可能是对的。

"Starting the three Eva's...now," said Ritsuko from the other side of the control room.  
“启动三台 EVA……现在。”赤木律子在控制室的另一端说道。

Shinji felt a familiar sensation of rushing down a tunnel at one hundred miles and hour, only to come out in the bright, open sun. Letting himself become relaxed, he closed his eyes and tried to concentrate. Which was increasingly hard as his headache was starting to throb again.  
真嗣感受到一种熟悉的穿梭隧道般的感觉，以每小时一百英里的速度疾驰，最终冲出隧道，沐浴在明媚的阳光下。他让自己放松下来，闭上眼睛，试图集中精神。但随着头痛再次开始跳动，这变得越来越困难。

Up in the control room Ritsuko was monitoring the three pilots closely, though she was monitoring one of them a lot more than the others.  
在控制室里，赤木律子正密切监视着三位驾驶员，尽管她对其中一位的关注远超其他人。

"Any change in heart rate? Brain waves? Breathing?"  
"心率有变化吗？脑电波？呼吸呢？"

"Negative ma'am. ...Wait. Pilot 01's brain waves are slightly shifting."  
"没有变化，女士。...等等。01 号飞行员的脑电波有轻微波动。"

"Is it controllable?" "能控制住吗？"

"At this infrequency its nothing to worry about."  
"在这种频率下，没什么好担心的。"

"Hmmm. Okay watch it closely and let me know if anything happens."  
"嗯，好吧，密切观察，有任何情况就告诉我。"

"Hai." "嗨。"

As Ritsuko turned away from the monitor to look out of the clear glass that acted as a barrier incase an Eva went out of control, and a mirror so the research could be given a clear picture, she wondered if the commanders instructions were groundless or if there was something else behind his words. She had always known after all that he was gifted with keeping secrets.  
当律子从监视器前转身，望向那块透明玻璃——既是防止 EVA 失控的屏障，也是让研究者能清晰观察的镜子——她不禁思索，指挥官的指示是无的放矢，还是背后另有隐情。毕竟，她一直知道他擅长保守秘密。

Back inside the entry plug Shinji's headache was starting to increase in pain, but he attempted to push it to the back of him mind. Though it felt like the source of the headache was his mind.  
回到插入栓内，真嗣的头痛开始加剧，但他试图将其抛诸脑后。尽管头痛的源头似乎来自他的内心。

'_Looks like somethings has changed with you.'_  
'看来你有些变化了。'

Shinji heard the familiar voice resounding all around him and had to bite his tongue so as not to start yelling.  
真嗣听到那熟悉的声音在四周回响，不得不咬紧舌头以免开始大喊。

'If you don't mind I'm having a tough time concentrating, and you're making it all the more difficult.'  
'如果你不介意的话，我正难以集中注意力，而你让这变得更困难了。'

'_I've got nothing to do with that headache of yours. Thats because you acted out simply in anger.'_  
'你的头痛可跟我没关系。那是因为你只是出于愤怒而发作。'

'What are you tal-' '你在说什么——'

'_That girls father, what you did to him.'_  
'那个女孩的父亲，你对他的所作所为。'

'What the hell does that have to do with my headaches? And why do you even know about that?'  
'这跟我头痛有什么关系？你又是怎么知道的？'

'_Its not like you were keeping your thoughts hidden or anything. Its like a constant screaming in your head of what happened.'_  
'你又没刻意隐藏自己的想法，脑子里一直在尖叫着那些事。'

'Stop damn it!' '停下，该死的！'

Silence for a moment, and then.  
沉默了一会儿，然后。

'_Whats wrong? Starting to question some stuff about yourself? That punch could have rivaled a boxers. Bit unusual for a scrawny fifteen year old kid to incapacitate a full grown man.'_  
'怎么了？开始质疑自己了吗？那一拳的力道简直能媲美拳击手。对一个瘦弱的十五岁孩子来说，能打倒一个成年男子，确实有点不寻常。'

'Shut the fuck up damn it!'  
'闭嘴，该死的！'

'_You should really control that temper. Next time you lash out in anger you just might end of up hurting somebody important to you.'_  
'你真该控制一下你的脾气。下次你再这样愤怒地爆发，可能会伤到对你重要的人。'

'Shut the fuck up!' '闭嘴！'

'_Be a tragedy to see that red head of yours loose a few of her limbs because you were so stupid and couldn't control your emotions.'_  
“看到你那头红发因为你的愚蠢和无法控制情绪而失去几条肢体，真是悲剧。”

"I TOLD YOU TO SHUT THE FUCK UP!"  
“我告诉过你他妈的闭嘴！”

Shinji yelled this directly inside of the entry plug and at the same time several things happened.  
真嗣在插入栓内直接大喊，与此同时，几件事情同时发生了。

Shinji's voice was projected directly into the control room where Misato, Ritsuko, and the others were and it came out shrill and high over the intercom. It sounded like he was screaming a war cry of some sort.  
真嗣的声音直接传入了控制室，那里有美里、律子和其他人，通过对讲机传出的声音尖锐而高亢。听起来他像是在发出某种战斗的呐喊。

Immediately Misato was at the intercom and started yelling back to Shinji what was wrong. Though all she got was a jumbled string of words tied together that she was unable to decipher.  
美里立刻冲到对讲机前，开始大声询问真嗣发生了什么事。然而她只听到一串混乱的词语交织在一起，无法理解。

Ritsuko on the other hand had rushed over to the synchronization monitors and swore loudly as she saw that his brain waves were jumping around frantically. Soon the wave lengths between Shinji and Unit 01 started to part and all but ceased. Unit 01 and Shinji's synchronization abruptly halted.  
另一方面，律子则迅速冲向同步监测器，看到他的脑波疯狂跳动时大声咒骂。很快，真嗣与初号机之间的波长开始分离，几乎完全停止。真嗣与初号机的同步突然中断了。

"Get him out of their now! Seal off Unit's 00 and 02 from 01 incase it goes berserk."  
“立刻把他弄出去！将 00 和 02 号单元与 01 号隔离，以防它发狂。”

Immediately at Misato words the same glass like barrier that separated the control room from the Eva's split down the middle of the floor, enclosing Unit 01 in its own small area.  
随着美里的话音落下，原本将控制室与 EVA 分隔开的玻璃般屏障沿着地板中央裂开，将 01 号单元封闭在其独立的小区域内。

"Deactivated Unit 01! Disconnect the umbilical cord, revert all available power to life support systems and send the code to eject the entry plug! Do it manually if you have to."  
“已停用 01 号单元！断开脐带电缆，将所有可用电力转至生命维持系统，并发送弹出插入栓的指令！必要时手动操作。”

"Umbilical cord removed successfully, but either Unit 01 or its pilot is rejecting the signal."  
"脐带电缆已成功移除，但无论是初号机还是其驾驶员，都在拒绝信号。"

"Then have somebody get down there and remove the plug manually!"  
"那就派人下去手动拔掉插头！"

"Wait a moment..." "稍等一下……"

Misato spun around and was surprised to see that Gendo had spoken.  
美里转过身，惊讶地发现源堂已经开口说话了。

"Commander?" “指挥官？”

"Wait for a minute to remove the entry plug."  
“稍等一会儿再取出插入栓。”

"...If I may ask...why?" “……如果可以问的话……为什么？”

"...An experiment. Keep a contingency crew prepared though. If Unit 01 goes berserk you have my permission to restrain it by any means. Make the rescue of the Eva the top priority, pilot second."  
"...一项实验。尽管如此，还是要准备好应急人员。如果零号机发狂，我授权你们可以采取任何手段进行限制。救援 Eva 是首要任务，驾驶员其次。"

Misato didn't like what he had ment with experiment, but she couldn't very well say no.  
Misato 不喜欢他所说的实验含义，但她也不能拒绝。

"...Okay...we wait for a minute or so then retrieve the pilot. Ritsuko?"  
"...好的...我们等上一分钟左右，然后救出驾驶员。律子？"

"Unit 01 has rejected all signals. Life of pilot is unknown at the moment. Unable to get a proper reading on anything."  
"初号机已拒绝所有信号。驾驶员生命状态目前未知。无法获取任何准确读数。"

"...I figured as much. Then we wait."  
"...我早有预料。那么，我们只能等待。"

---

'Where am I?' '我在哪儿？'

'_We're you should be.'_ '我们该去的地方。'

'Where is that?' '那是什么地方？'

'_Look around yourself and find out.'_  
'环顾四周，自己找出来。'

And so Shinji did what the faceless entity in front of him told him what to do.  
于是，真嗣按照面前这位无面实体的指示去做了。

It was the world...yet it wasn't. It was a world that was empty, non-existent so to speak. Because nothing existed anymore.  
这是世界...却又不是。这是一个空无一物、可以说是不存在的世界。因为一切都不复存在了。

Shinji looked around at the wasteland that he was standing on. Was this Earth in some bleak future where the angels have destroyed it?  
真嗣环顾四周，他所站立的这片荒原。这是否是地球在某个黯淡未来，被使徒毁灭后的景象？

He looked down at the ground he was standing on and was shocked to see a white sandy substance around him. Then, looking up, he saw blue sky with a cloud in sight. Whats more, there didn't seem to be anything like a sun in the sky. Why was everything so bright then?  
他低头看向脚下的地面，惊讶地发现周围是白色的沙状物质。接着，抬头望去，他看到了蓝天和一朵云。更重要的是，天空中似乎没有太阳。那为何一切又如此明亮？

Kneeling down he grasped a handful of the sandy substance and let it flow through his open hand. It really did seem like sand.  
他跪下来，抓起一把沙状物质，让它从张开的手掌中流过。这确实看起来像沙子。

'_That is not sand, as you just wondered. But the remains of the four hundred billions creatures that used to live on this planet.'_  
'那不是沙子，正如你刚才所疑惑的。而是曾经生活在这个星球上的四千亿生物的遗骸。'

'But what is this planet?'  
'但这个星球是什么？'

'_The name...I suppose you Lilim call it Earth. Its known as something much more tranquil though in our knowledge.'_  
'这个名字...我想你们莉莉姆称之为地球。但在我们的认知中，它有着更为宁静的称谓。'

'Your knowledge?' '你们的知识？'

'_Correct... I am an angel.'_  
'没错...我是一名天使。'

Normally Shinji would have frozen immediately, but this strange formless shape didn't seem to have any harm in itself.  
通常情况下，真嗣会立刻僵住，但这个奇怪的无形形态似乎本身并无害处。

'So what am I doing here?'  
“那么，我在这里做什么呢？”

'_First do you know who you are?'_  
“首先，你知道自己是谁吗？”

Shinji thought for a moment and realized that he didn't know what his name was. Shaking his head for a second he frowned at the white shape in front of him. It was then that he realized that the only residual thing he noticed that look at all like a living being was a lopsided mouth that hung at what would be considered a head.  
真嗣思索片刻，意识到自己并不知道它的名字。他摇了摇头，对着眼前白色的形状皱起眉头。这时他才注意到，唯一看起来像活物的东西是一个歪斜的嘴巴，挂在应该是头部的位置。

'_Well, I suppose you wouldn't know what your name is. Since you don't have one.'_  
'嗯，我想你不知道自己的名字，因为你没有名字。'

'What about you?' '那你呢？'

'_My name? Unimportant currently. I'm more interested in yourself. How did you come to be, for you certainly share common characteristics to angels'_  
'我的名字？眼下无关紧要。我更感兴趣的是你。你是如何成为这样的，因为你确实有着天使的共同特征。'

'What do you mean?' '你是什么意思？'

'_I don't know myself. You certainly are human, but something about you...'_  
'我不了解自己。你无疑是人类，但关于你...'

Shinji was silent for a minute as he didn't know how to respond to this. Finally shaking the discomfort off he glanced around at his surroundings again and said, 'What are you doing here?'  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，因为他不知道该如何回应。最终，他甩开不适感，再次环顾四周，问道：'你在这里做什么？'

'_Hmmm? I was waiting for my time to come. I believe it should be soon. My brothers, while powerful shall not survive. I'm supposed to pave the way for the next generation of angels after all.'_  
'嗯？我在等待我的时机到来。我相信应该很快了。我的兄弟们虽然强大，但不会幸存。毕竟，我应该为下一代天使铺平道路。'

'You said this was Earth...'  
'你说过这是地球...'

'_It is Earth as we know it. Much different from the lush, green one that the Lilim come from.'_  
'这是我们所知的地球。与莉莉姆们来自的那片葱郁绿意之地大相径庭。'

'Lilim?' '莉莉姆？'

'_Humans...that is what you call yourself. He originally named you Lilim and that is what we have called you.'_  
'人类……那是你们对自己的称呼。他最初称你们为莉莉姆，这也是我们一直以来的叫法。'

'...I don't even know how I got here, or what my name is.'  
'...我甚至不知道我是怎么来到这里的，或者我的名字是什么。'

'_Well, on that account your name would be Ikari Shinji. Though that is your name given by the Lilim. I had forgotten that the Lilim have changed there ways since they first rose out of the ground those many years ago.'_  
'那么，基于这一点，你的名字应该是碇真嗣。虽然这是人类给你的名字。我忘了人类自从许多年前从地下崛起以来，他们的方式已经改变了。'

Shinji was silent for a moment before he asked something that had been bothering him. 'How old are you?'  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后问了一个一直困扰他的问题。'你多大了？'

'_My age? I have lost count of that nearly a millennium ago. Though I am one of the oldest beings alive in the universe. Of course, angels do not keep track of there age as humans do, because angels are fundamentally immortal.'_  
'我的年龄？近千年前我就已经记不清了。虽然我是宇宙中存活最久的生物之一。当然，天使不像人类那样记录自己的年龄，因为天使本质上是不朽的。'

'Fundamentally?' '本质上？'

'_Only an angel can kill an angel.'_  
'只有天使能杀死天使。'

'You say that I'm like you. In what way?'  
'你说我像你。在哪方面？'

'_...As I said it is difficult to discern about you because I have never met a human that has the aura of an angel about them.'_  
'...正如我所说，很难判断你，因为我从未遇到过像你这样带有天使气息的人类。'

'Aura?' '气息？'

'_An AT-field so to speak. Of course all humans have an AT-field with some substance, some more than others I suppose. But yours is different. It feels like an angels.'_  
“可以说是 AT 力场。当然，所有人类都有一定程度的 AT 力场，有些人可能比其他人更强。但你的不同。它感觉像是天使的。”

'...This makes no sense. How come I have this...'  
“……这说不通。我怎么会有这种……”

'_I'm not sure. For someone as me who thought that knowledge was a fabrication of this world, I must say it makes me think as I have not thought in sometime.'_  
“我不确定。对于像我这样曾经认为知识是这个世界虚构的人来说，这让我思考起一些久未触及的问题。”

'...Glad I could help. I think.'  
'...很高兴能帮上忙。我想。'

'_Everything comes to an end, even knowledge. Because knowledge is impossible to gain unless things exist. Take this world for instance. If you look up, you see blue sky. If you look down, you see what life has turned into after many years. If you would walk further along this line of sand, you would see never ending miles of it. Nothing. There is nothing here. And so, knowledge does not exist.'_  
'万物皆有终结，知识亦然。因为若非事物存在，知识无从获得。以这个世界为例。抬头望，你见蓝天。低头看，你见多年后生命所化之物。若你沿着这条沙线继续前行，你将看到无尽的沙海。空无一物。这里什么都没有。因此，知识并不存在。'

'_..._But you still retain the knowledge you have gathered.'  
'...但你仍保留着你所积累的知识。'

'_True, but with the passage of time, things start to slip away. The Lilim are so redundant that I stopped caring for them after the first few years of there existence. They are an eye sore now.'_  
“确实，但随着时间的流逝，事物开始逐渐消逝。莉莉姆们如此多余，以至于在她们存在的最初几年后，我便不再关心她们了。现在她们只是碍眼的存在。”

'So if I'm a Lilim what are you supposed to do with me?'  
“那么，如果我是莉莉姆，你打算怎么处置我？”

The white, shapeless object was silent for a moment as it pondered Shinji's question. Eventually it said, '_You seem to be something that is not wholesomely here. Your mind is wandering while your body lies else where. Your mind is wandering in front of me. If I were to destroy it, your body would become a useless pile of flesh. Harsh, but true. I look at you and think, what should I do regarding the fact that you are both angel and human? I cant judge this situation with out asking for his help. I'll let you go.'_  
那个白色、无定形的物体沉默了一会儿，思考着真嗣的问题。最终它说道：“你似乎是一种不完全存在于此的东西。你的心灵在游荡，而你的身体却躺在别处。你的心灵在我面前徘徊。如果我摧毁它，你的身体将变成一堆无用的肉块。虽然残酷，但这是事实。我看着你，思考着，面对你既是天使又是人类的事实，我该怎么做？没有他的帮助，我无法判断这个情况。我会放你走。”

Shinji realized that he had been involuntarily holding his breath in and just released it.  
真嗣意识到自己一直在不由自主地屏住呼吸，这才松了一口气。

'How much of this will I retain?'  
“我能记住多少呢？”

'_Good question. My guess is that you were brought here against your own will. I don't know how that would have happened though. You should not remember any of this. I think it would hinder more than anything.'_  
“好问题。我猜你是被迫来到这里的。虽然我不知道这是怎么发生的。按理说你不应该记得这些。我想这只会妨碍更多。”

'Well, I suppose I should thank you for everything that you've told me, whether or not I remember it.'  
'嗯，我想我应该感谢你告诉我的一切，无论我是否记得。'

'_Don't let yourself worry about it. I can only hope that I'm able to meet you sometime again, in a peaceful way such as this.'_  
'别为此担心。我只希望将来某一天能以这样和平的方式再次与你相遇。'

'_..._One last thing, how exactly am I supposed to get back?'  
'...还有最后一件事，我究竟该怎么回去？'

'_Thats an easy one.'_ '那是个简单的问题。'

Shinji opened his mouth to ask what was easy about it when he felt something hook on the back of his navel and drag him backwards. Looking up just in time before he was thrown back into his body he thought he saw a sad smile appear on the shapes face.  
真嗣张口想问这有什么简单的，却感到肚脐后有什么东西钩住了他，将他向后拖去。在被抛回自己身体之前的一瞬，他觉得自己看到那东西的脸上浮现出一丝悲伤的微笑。

'_Though I suppose...that my wishful thinking of a peaceful conversation will come to nothing in the end. Ikari Shinji-kun.'_  
'不过我想……我那和平对话的愿望最终还是会落空吧。碇真嗣君。'

Shinji heard no more.  真嗣再也没听到任何声音。

---

White. Why is it always white?  
白色。为什么总是白色？

As Shinji blinked open his eyes he wondered how many days he had been out. The clock in his body felt completely wrong.  
当真嗣眨开眼睛时，他不知道自己已经昏迷了多少天。他体内的生物钟感觉完全错乱了。

Sitting up he had to wonder if he had spent more time in this room then at Misato's place, but quickly pushed that silly thought away.  
坐起身来，他不禁疑惑自己在这个房间待的时间是否比在美里小姐那儿还多，但很快就把这个愚蠢的念头抛开了。

Looking to his left he was unsurprised that several chairs had been positioned around his bed. But blinking several times he was surprised that he had missed what was so obvious. Two of the chairs were occupied. One was sleeping with their head resting on the end of his bed while the other was calmly cutting an apple in six equal parts. Shinji thought that Asuka and Rei were the most unlikely pair to be seated at his side.  
向左看去，他并不意外地发现几把椅子围在他的床边。但眨了几下眼后，他惊讶地发现自己竟然忽略了如此明显的事实。两把椅子上有人。一个正枕着他的床尾睡着，而另一个则平静地将一个苹果切成六等份。真嗣觉得，明日香和丽是最不可能坐在他身边的两个人。

As though Rei had heard Shinji's thoughts, she looked up briefly during which something tugged at the corners of her mouth. It might have been something akin to a smile.  
仿佛听到了真嗣的心声，丽抬头瞥了一眼，嘴角微微牵动，那或许是一种近似微笑的表情。

"Are you feeling better Ikari-kun?"  
"碇君，感觉好些了吗？"

"...I guess so. I mean...I don't even know what happened."  
"...应该是吧。我的意思是...我甚至不知道发生了什么。"

"Unit 01 went berserk while you were in it."  
"你在里面的时候，初号机暴走了。"

"...I figured it be something like that. What day is it anyway?"  
"...我就猜到会是这样。话说回来，今天是几号？"

"Its the same day as the test, though several hours afterwards."  
"就是考试的那天，不过已经是几个小时之后了。"

It was then that Shinji realized that no light was coming from outside the large windows in the room. The artificial light in the Geofront had long since dissipated leaving behind a solid darkness.  
就在这时，真嗣意识到房间里的大窗户没有透进一丝光线。地底都市的人工照明早已熄灭，留下了一片漆黑。

As Shinji continued to look out the darkened windows he heard a small, "Here," and looked around to see the plate of apples cut neatly in front of him.  
当真嗣继续凝视着昏暗的窗外时，他听到一声轻微的，“给，”随即环顾四周，发现一盘整齐切好的苹果摆在了他面前。

Looking at Rei wordlessly he took two of them and popped them into his mouth. It was then that he realized how hungry he had been.  
他无声地看着绫波，拿起两片苹果塞进嘴里。这时他才意识到自己有多饿。

"These are good Ayanami."  
“这些苹果很好吃，绫波。”

"...Ariga-too." "...有贺-图。"

Shinji swallowed hard and glanced back at her. He had never heard Rei say words of thanks before and apparently she had never said it before either as a puzzled expression was on her face. Smiling slightly back at her he decided it was about time to wake someone. If not the smell of the apples was sure to wake her eventually.  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，回头看了看她。他从未听过绫波说感谢的话，显然她自己也从未说过，因为她脸上带着困惑的表情。他微微对她笑了笑，决定是时候叫醒某个人了。如果再不叫醒她，苹果的香味肯定会把她唤醒。

Crawling to the end of his bed he frowned down at Asuka. Her hair was a disheveled mess and the skirt and shirt she was wearing was crumpled and frayed at the edges.  
他爬到床尾，皱着眉头看着明日香。她的头发凌乱不堪，裙子和衬衫皱巴巴的，边缘也磨损了。

Unsure of how to proceed he ended up lightly tapping the side of her cheek with the back of his hand. This was unwise and next moment she shot upwards, smashing the top of her head into Shinji's chin and sending him reeling backwards.  
不确定如何继续，他最终轻轻地用手指背面轻拍了她的脸颊。这一举动不明智，下一刻她猛地坐起，头顶撞上了真嗣的下巴，让他向后踉跄了几步。

"Baka!" "笨蛋！"

'First thing up and she already calls me an idiot,' thought Shinji gloomily as he landed on the floor.  
‘刚醒来就叫我白痴，’真嗣沮丧地想着，摔倒在地板上。

As Asuka blinked her eyes open wearily, as though she didn't know where she was, she immediately looked to the bed she was resting on, only to find out that it was empty.  
当明日香疲惫地睁开眼睛，仿佛不知道自己在哪里，她立刻看向她躺着的床，却发现床上空无一人。

"Shin-" "真-

"Here," said Shinji as he pulled himself back onto the bed and into a sitting position.  
"过来，" 真嗣说着，重新爬回床上，坐直了身子。

Shinji wouldn't have been at all surprised if Asuka had tackled him there and started pounding the shit out of him. Instead she look confusedly back at him before crawling up on the bed and sat directly in front of him.  
如果明日香当时扑向他，开始狠狠揍他一顿，真嗣一点也不会感到惊讶。相反，她困惑地回头看了他一眼，然后爬上床，直接坐在他面前。

"Asuka what are you-" “明日香，你在干什么——”

Whack! 啪！

Asuka smacked him with all her strength against the side of his head, sending him crashing against the bed frame and thankfully, the pillow which absorbed some of the impact.  
明日香用尽全力朝他头侧一拍，让他猛地撞上了床架，幸好有枕头缓冲，减轻了些许冲击。

Rubbing the side of his cheek he angrily yelled back, "Damn it Asuka! What the hell was that-"  
他揉着脸颊，愤怒地吼回去：“该死的明日香！你到底在搞什么鬼——”

Asuka grabbed the front of his shirt and dragged him in front of her so that their noses were a mere centimeter apart. Throughout all this Rei didn't move a muscle. Maybe she could understand Asuka's rage, even if only a little.  
明日香抓住他的衬衫前襟，将他拽到面前，两人的鼻尖仅相距一厘米。整个过程中，绫波零一动不动。或许她能理解明日香的愤怒，哪怕只是一点点。

"You idiot! Do you have any idea how worried everyone was! All that screaming and shouting...I..everyone thought that you were dying!"  
“你这个白痴！你知道大家有多担心吗！那些尖叫和喊声……我……大家都以为你要死了！”

"...What are you talking-"  
"...你在说什么-"

"You! You went crazy inside of your Eva. Trying to destroy every damn thing in sight! You almost killed several people."  
"你！你在 Eva 里发疯了。试图摧毁视线中的一切！你差点杀了好几个人。"

"...I did what?" "...我做了什么？"

"...You...don't remember?"  
"...你...不记得了？"

"Everything is such a blur that I can barely remember even entering the entry plug."  
"一切都模糊不清，我几乎连进入驾驶舱的记忆都没有。"

Asuka looked blankly back at Shinji for a moment before turning towards Rei. If some far corner of her mind thought that Rei was going to help her, she was sorely mistaken. Rei continued sitting there with the same blank expression on her face that she had been wearing for the past few minutes.  
绫波零茫然地看了真嗣一会儿，然后转向丽。如果她内心深处曾以为丽会帮助她，那她大错特错了。丽继续坐在那里，脸上保持着几分钟以来一直未变的空白表情。

Starting to talk more slowly, as though Shinji had some learning disability, Asuka started talking about what happened after Shinji had mentally blacked out.  
开始放慢语速，仿佛真嗣有学习障碍似的，明日香开始讲述真嗣精神崩溃后发生的事情。

"Nobody knows how it happened in the first place, but the commander gave the order for us to wait and see if anything changed."  
“起初没人知道是怎么回事，但司令下令让我们静观其变，看看是否会有什么变化。”

Shinji frowned, he should have guessed that this had something to do with his father.  
真嗣皱起眉头，他本该猜到这与他父亲脱不了关系。

"I don't know how long I was stuck sitting in that entry plug, but I heard a loud shriek come over the intercom. It was you...but it wasn't you. I mean it was your voice, but...I don't know just something sounded strange about your voice. Sorry if I can't explain it any better than that."  
"我不知道自己在插入栓里坐了多久，但突然听到对讲机里传来一声尖叫。那是你...但又不是你。我是说，那是你的声音，但...就是感觉有些奇怪。抱歉，我无法更好地解释了。"

"Anyway, while you were screaming the Eva awoke by itself, with the umbilical cord unattached. Ritsuko later said that you and the Eva weren't even close to having a high enough sync ratio to control the Eva. It awoke by itself I guess and acted of its own accord."  
"不管怎样，当你尖叫时，EVA 自行启动了，脐带电缆并未连接。律子后来告诉我，你和 EVA 的同步率远未达到控制它的水平。我想它是自行觉醒并自主行动的。"

"It broke free of the restraints that was holding it in place, but the odd thing was that it used an AT-field and severed the metallic braces that were attached to it. Afterwards it started going berserk and tried to break the glass barrier. Several times it tried to destroy it with an AT-field."  
"它挣脱了固定它的束缚，奇怪的是，它使用了 AT 力场切断了连接在它身上的金属支架。之后，它开始发狂，试图打破玻璃屏障。多次尝试用 AT 力场摧毁它。"

"...What-" "...什么-"

"Yeah...I thought that I pilot had to concentrate on the generation of an AT-field. After that didn't work though it started pounding on the glass with its arms. I don't think I noticed until later, but your screams intensified then."  
"是的...我以为驾驶员必须专注于 AT 力场的生成。但后来那东西开始用胳膊猛击玻璃。我想我是后来才注意到，但那时你的尖叫声加剧了。"

"What do you mean you noticed later?"  
"你说的后来注意到是什么意思？"

Asuka was silent for a moment before she said, "...Look at your arms."  
明日香沉默了一会儿，然后说道：“……看看你的手臂。”

Shinji did as he was told and looked at both his arms. They were heavily wrapped in bandages.  
真嗣照做了，看向自己的双臂。它们被厚厚的绷带紧紧包裹着。

"What happ-" “发生了什——”

"Ritsuko said that its an anomaly that can occur sometimes, but she said its only supposed to happen if there is a strong sync between the pilot and the Eva. Furthermore it was a rare case. Injury's to the pilots aren't unheard of but yours were different she said.  
律子说这是一种有时会出现的异常现象，但她表示只有在驾驶员与 Eva 之间存在强烈同步的情况下才会发生。而且这是一个罕见的情况。驾驶员受伤并不罕见，但你的情况不同，她这么说。

"How so?" "此话怎讲？"

"...She didn't really say and I didn't press her. I didn't care that much myself."  
……她没具体说，我也没追问。我自己也没那么在意。

Shinji was silent for a minute as he wondered what could possibly be underneath his bandages and was tempted to unwrap them, but Asuka would surely yell at him. Deciding on another course of action, he asked, "What happened after that? Did the Eva stop...or something."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，他好奇绷带下到底是什么，甚至想解开它们，但明日香肯定会对他大吼大叫。于是他决定换个问题，问道：“那之后发生了什么？Eva 停下了……还是怎么了？”

"Yeah, except, nobody knows why or how, but it suddenly stopped responding and just stood there while leaning against the glass barrier."  
“是啊，只不过，没人知道原因和方式，但它突然就不再回应，只是靠在玻璃屏障上站着。”

"...You said that I almost killed several people, but I don't see how-"  
“……你说我差点害死了几个人，但我看不出怎么回事——”

"...I think that was the part that worried everyone the most. After the commander gave the order to recover the Eva and yourself. Well...when they retrieved the entry plug, you weren't cooperating. That was probably the hardest part. When they managed to get you out you started going into a frenzy, trying to strangle anybody that got near you, all the time screaming. You even punched several people, breaking their noses. Me and Misato were watching the entire thing from the control room. They had to put you in restraints and it was only thanks to Misato that you were let out, after you had calmed down a bit."  
“……我想那部分是最让人担心的。指挥官下令回收 Eva 和你之后……嗯……他们打开插入栓时，你并不配合。那大概是最困难的部分。当他们好不容易把你弄出来时，你开始发狂，试图掐死任何靠近你的人，一边尖叫一边打人。你还打断了几个人的鼻子。我和美里在指挥室全程看着。他们不得不给你上约束带，多亏了美里，你稍微冷静一些后才被放出来。”

"Asuka I-" "明日香一号-"

"Don't say anything. I don't know what happened to you nor do I care. ...Everyone...including me, is just glad that you're fine."  
"什么都别说。我不知道你发生了什么，也不在乎。...包括我在内，大家都只是很高兴你没事。"

"But I did something that I had no control over."  
"但我做了一些我无法控制的事情。"

"You didn't do anything! You weren't in control. While I hate saying this, I know who you are, and that was definitely not the Shinji that I know inside of the Eva."  
"你什么都没做！你当时无法控制自己。虽然我不愿意这么说，但我知道你是谁，那绝对不是我在 Eva 里认识的真嗣。"

Shinji felt oddly touched by Asuka's words. It ment a lot to him that she had said she understood who he was, because he was starting to doubt himself.  
真嗣听到明日香的话，感到一种莫名的感动。她能说出理解他这个人，对他来说意义重大，因为他自己也开始怀疑自己了。

"I don't care what Ritsuko or your father says. That was not you, so don't go apologizing for it."  
"我才不管律子或你父亲怎么说。那不是你，所以别为此道歉。"

"...Asuka...I..." "...Asuka...我..."

"Quit it already! Just think of this as payment for helping myself out over the past few days."  
"别再说了！就当这是帮我过去几天忙的报酬吧。"

"...No...but anybody would have done that."  
"...不...但换作任何人都会那样做的。"

Asuka just glared at him and Shinji took that as an end to the conversation. Dragging the talk to something that was less unpleasant, Shinji said something that was sure to get Asuka rilled up.  
明日香只是瞪了他一眼，真嗣便识趣地结束了对话。为了转移到一个不那么令人不快的话题，真嗣说了一句肯定会让明日香激动起来的话。

"I'm surprised that you and Ayanami were able to be in the same room though, and for a long period of time."  
“我倒是挺惊讶你和绫波能待在同一个房间里，而且还是那么长时间。”

"Tch...why do you think I was sleeping? I'd rather waste time sleeping then try to have a conversation with the teachers pet."  
“切……你以为我为什么要睡觉？我宁愿浪费时间睡觉，也不想和那个老师的宠儿说话。”

Sighing, Shinji said, "I don't know why you're so stubborn. I get on fine with Ayanami."  
叹了口气，真嗣说：“我不知道你为什么这么固执。我和绫波相处得很好。”

"Thats your problem, not mine."  
“那是你的问题，不是我的。”

Flopping back down onto his blankets, Shinji ignored any further mumbles and sighs from Asuka for a while and looked up at the white ceiling in front of him. White? Why did white feel so familiar all the sudden? As he wracked his brains to try to find an answer he heard Asuka say, "Well you're okay so I suppose I'll go."  
真嗣又躺回被子里，暂时无视了明日香更多的咕哝和叹息，抬头望着眼前的白色天花板。白色？为什么白色突然感觉如此熟悉？他绞尽脑汁试图找到答案，这时听到明日香说：“好吧，既然你没事，那我就走了。”

Nodding, Shinji said, "Okay I'll go with you...just as soon as I find my-"  
点头后，真嗣说：“好的，我会跟你一起去……只要我找到我的——”

Speaking up, Rei said, "Doctor Akagi wishes you to stay here tonight."  
丽开口说道：“赤木博士希望你今晚留在这里。”

Turning towards the sound of Rei's voice Shinji said, "Huh?"  
真嗣转向丽声音的方向说：“啊？”

"IvHate to agree with the pet but Ritsuko does want you to stay here tonight, just in case you have a relapse."  
"虽然不想同意那只宠物的意见，但律子确实希望你今晚留在这里，以防万一你复发。"

"I feel perfectly fine though."  
"但我感觉完全没问题。"

"No arguing!" "不许争辩！"

"But-" "但——"

Completely ignoring Shinji's protests, Asuka stood up, spun herself around, and wordlessly walked out of the room.  
完全无视真嗣的抗议，明日香站起身来，转了一圈，然后默默地走出了房间。

Shinji mouthed back at her sudden disappearance before running his hands through his hair. Well, he should be thankful that she had waited by his side for at least seven hours before he woke up. Turning to Rei he said, "She's probably right Ayanami. Even though she didn't want to say anything, she knows that I need to get some rest."  
真嗣对着她突然消失的背影张了张嘴，随后双手穿过头发。好吧，他应该感激她至少在他醒来前陪在他身边七个小时。转向绫波，他说道："她可能是对的，绫波。尽管她不想说什么，但她知道我需要休息。"

Understanding him perfectly fine, Rei stood up, setting the plate of apples on the table next to Shinji's bed and silently walked to the door. Though just as she was about to pass through the open door she turned and said, "Goodnight, Ikari-kun."  
完全理解他的心思，丽站起身来，将一盘苹果放在真嗣床边的桌上，然后默默走向门口。就在她即将穿过敞开的门时，她转过身来说道：“晚安，碇君。”

Shinji waited until he could hear her footsteps becoming quieter and quieter before he sprung into action. Carefully grabbing onto a loose edge of the bandages surrounding his arm, he carefully started to unwind them. What was underneath made Shinji feel sick to his stomach.  
真嗣一直等到她的脚步声越来越远，才迅速行动起来。他小心翼翼地抓住缠绕在手臂上的绷带松散的一角，开始仔细地解开。绷带下的景象让真嗣感到一阵恶心。

The skin of his arms looked as though large splinters of wood had been hammered into his arms, only to be pulled back out by the reverse side of the hammer. He had many scars pockmarked across his arms and wondered how in the hell he could have received that from the glass barrier.  
他手臂上的皮肤看起来像是被大块的木片钉进去，然后又被锤子的另一头拔出来。他的手臂上布满了疤痕，他不禁疑惑自己究竟是如何从玻璃屏障上受到这样的伤害的。

...He felt stupid. ...他觉得自己很蠢。

Glass is still glass no matter how you look at it. Unit 01 must have managed to split off several pieces in its rage and some of it had been lodged into its armor and in turn Shinji had received these large puncture marks. Though he had to assume that they had been bleeding when he received them, yet here they were, clearly healed as though he had received them two months ago. Yet he always seemed to heal easily, even larger injuries. He remember in the fourth grade when he had broken his arm on the swing set. One week later his arm was fully healed.  
玻璃终究是玻璃，无论你怎么看。初号机在愤怒中必定是设法分裂出了几块碎片，其中一些嵌入了它的装甲，进而刺入了真嗣的身体，留下了这些深深的刺痕。尽管他不得不假设这些伤口在他受伤时是流血的，但此刻它们明显愈合了，仿佛是两个月前受的伤。然而他总是容易愈合，即使是更大的伤口。他记得四年级时在秋千上摔断了胳膊，一周后手臂就完全康复了。

"..._something about you..."_  
“...你身上有些什么...”

This sudden thought struck him like a bolt of lightning and he started looking around for the source of this sudden thought. Why did it feel like he had heard these words in the same context.  
这个突如其来的念头如闪电般击中了他，他开始四处寻找这个突然出现的想法的源头。为什么感觉好像在同样的情境下听过这些话。

'I've got to be over thinking this,' he said to himself as he rolled over and tried to close his eyes.  
'我一定是想太多了，'他自言自语道，翻了个身，试图闭上眼睛。

Sleep did not come easily that night  
那一晚，睡眠并不轻易降临

### Chapter 11: Emotions
**Hey everyone, its Halloween...well okay it just turned halloween fourteen minutes ago according to my clock. So yeah I'm posting this very early...because I'm declaring this Double Sunday. (Dragon Ball Z anyone?) So I'm actually releasing two chapters today, the first this obviously and the second one well...I've only gotten five pages out of...twenty-five? I'll try to get it out around two, (Pacific time) but I'm not making an promises. I actually had to help with a friends haunted house yesterday and pulled an all nighter at his house to finish this...Yes I'm very tired. I have not slept yet. There is something oddly fun about dressing up as a clown and scaring little kids though. I don't know...maybe its cause I'm reading It right now. (Stephen King)  
大家好，今天是万圣节...好吧，根据我的时钟，万圣节刚刚过去了十四分钟。所以我提前发布了这个...因为我宣布今天是双周日。（有人看过《龙珠 Z》吗？）所以今天我会发布两章，第一章显然是这个，第二章嘛...我只写出了五页...总共二十五页？我会尽量在两点前完成（太平洋时间），但不保证。昨天我实际上还帮朋友布置了鬼屋，在他家通宵完成了这个...是的，我非常累。我还没睡过觉。不过，装扮成小丑吓唬小孩子倒是挺有趣的。我不知道...可能是因为我正在读《它》（斯蒂芬·金）。**

**Okay so few quick things. Number one is that chapter twelve is...not really halloween themed, but its certainly horrifying and gruesome enough in its own right. So thats kinda my treat to everyone. Number two: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT BOAT LOAD OF REVIEW. I had so many reviews/favs/alerts that it started going into my spam box for my email. Anyway this is getting long winded and what not so I'm gonna end it here. Also at the end of this will be a brief preview of the next chapter..just the first two paragraphs. Read at your own risk!  
好了，有几个要点快速说一下。第一，第十二章并不是真正意义上的万圣节主题，但它本身足够恐怖和血腥。所以这算是我给大家的小小惊喜。第二：非常感谢大家的海量评论！我收到了太多评论/收藏/提醒，以至于它们开始涌入我的垃圾邮件箱。话说回来，我这番话已经有点啰嗦了，所以就到此为止吧。另外，文末会有下一章的简短预览，仅前两段。阅读请自行斟酌风险！**

Shinji could feel that something had changed, both inside and outside.  
真嗣能感觉到，内外都发生了变化。

He spent much of the next day at Nerv, cooped up in the room with nothing to look at but white walls. He felt like he was some experiment that they had locked up and were now running tests on. When he asked Ritsuko why he had to be kept there for an extra day, and why he would occasionally have to be taken to another room where he would be hooked up to all sorts of computer equipment, she simply said it was to be sure he hadn't been contaminated in any way. Did they consider him stupid?  
第二天大部分时间，他都待在 NERV，困在一个除了白墙别无他物的房间里。他觉得自己就像是被锁起来进行实验的对象，时不时还要被带到另一个房间，连接到各种电脑设备上。当他问律子为什么他需要多留一天，以及为什么偶尔要被带到另一个房间时，她只是简单地说这是为了确保他没有受到任何污染。他们难道认为他很愚蠢吗？

He had noticed a change in the personal the moment he had left his room; they shunned away from him. Small things he would notice, like lack of eye contact, or jitteriness whenever he would get near to somebody. Bottom line was, he suspected they had suddenly become afraid of him. And a part of him couldn't blame them, if what Asuka had said was true, which he highly doubted after seeing this.  
自从他离开房间的那一刻起，他就注意到工作人员的态度发生了变化；他们开始回避他。他会注意到一些细微的事情，比如缺乏眼神交流，或者每当他靠近某人时，对方就会显得紧张不安。总之，他怀疑他们突然对他产生了恐惧。而有一部分的他无法责怪他们，如果明日香所说的是真的，尽管在看到这些后他高度怀疑。

Above all else, he had noticed a change within himself. He seemed more sensitive to his environment, and specifically the facial features of people. His visions had gotten stronger to the point of several minutes of time passing when he couldn't remember what he had been doing minutes before. He felt no change in his physical body, and yet felt that he had grown...an extension of some kind. Like he could project it if his thoughts willed it to.  
最重要的是，他注意到自己内心的变化。他对环境的敏感度似乎提高了，特别是对人们的面部特征。他的视觉能力变得更强，以至于有几次他记不清几分钟前自己在做什么，时间就这样流逝了几分钟。他感觉自己的身体没有变化，但却觉得自己成长了...某种形式的延伸。仿佛只要他的思维愿意，就能将其投射出来。

Something had happened, he was sure of that. Try as hard as he might, he was not able to remember anything from his time enclosed inside of Unit 01. Occasionally he thought he got brief flashes of things that had either happened inside the entry plug, and outside the entry plug. And yet, he felt there was a gap of some kind that was missing. He kept thinking of the ocean and how the sand felt as it crunched between a persons toes.  
某件事情确实发生了，他对此深信不疑。尽管他竭尽全力，却无法回忆起自己在初号机内被封闭期间的任何事情。偶尔，他会觉得自己捕捉到了一些短暂的片段，无论是发生在插入栓内还是外面的。然而，他感觉似乎缺失了某种间隙。他不断想起海洋，以及沙子在人们脚趾间嘎吱作响的感觉。

It was the lowest point he had reached while he had been a pilot at Nerv. The only thing that he found remotely enjoyable was the fact that Asuka seemed to have spent every moment that day by his side. Granted, she was forced to go to school by Misato since they had missed so much recently, but besides that, she had been by his side when he had awoken in the morning, and when she had left late that night. He was even visited by Rei, during the time Asuka was at school and spend a few hours with her. It never occurred to him to ask why she wasn't at school herself.  
这是他在 NERV 担任驾驶员期间所经历的最低谷。唯一让他略感欣慰的是，明日香似乎那一天每时每刻都陪在他身边。当然，由于最近缺课太多，美里强迫她去上学，但除此之外，她在他早晨醒来时就在他身边，直到深夜她离开时也是如此。明日香上学期间，绫波零也来探望过他，与他共度了几小时。他从未想过要问她为什么自己不去上学。

All in all it had been a hectic day for Shinji and he was immensely glad to be back at Misato's apartment a day later. Well, standing on the door step felt more accurate to say as he hadn't even put his hand on the doorknob yet. Though he was saved the trouble as the door was thrown open, during which Shinji got an eye full of bright, strawberry colored hair, before he was wrenched into the open door and greeted by raucous group of people.  
总的来说，这一天对真嗣来说异常忙碌，他非常高兴能在一天后回到美里小姐的公寓。嗯，站在门口更准确地说，因为他还没来得及伸手去摸门把手。不过，门突然被打开了，真嗣眼前一亮，看到了一头鲜艳的草莓色头发，随后他被拽进了门内，迎接他的是一群喧闹的人。

"WELCOME BACK SHINJI," was hollered so loud that Shinji was sure the neighbors below them would call the police.  
“欢迎回来，真嗣！”这声大喊如此响亮，真嗣确信楼下邻居会报警。

A large group of people had been crowded into the small kitchen that Shinji thought could never house so many people.  
一大群人挤进了狭小的厨房，真嗣觉得这里从来没容纳过这么多人。

Asuka, Touji, Kensuke, Hikari, Rei, Misato, and a man that Shinji didn't recognize, were grouped around the small kitchen table, all with beaming faces and holding some kind of drink. In Misato's case it was a beer can.  
明日香、冬二、真希、光、丽、美里，还有一位真嗣不认识的男子，围坐在小厨房的桌子旁，每个人都面带笑容，手里拿着某种饮料。美里手里的是一罐啤酒。

Shinji stood dumbstruck in the doorway, attempting to take in the scene before him, but failing miserably, and it was only thanks to a sudden bark like cry from Touji that he was able to speak.  
真嗣呆立在门口，试图理解眼前的景象，却完全无法做到，直到冬二突然发出一声像狗吠般的喊叫，他才得以开口说话。

"...Everyone...you didn't have to do-"  
“……大家……你们不必这么做——”

Misato cut him off quickly, saying, "Don't worry about anything. We heard that you would be let out early and just thought to throw this surprise party is all. You gave us a real scare Shinji."  
美里迅速打断他，说道：“别担心任何事。我们听说你会提前出院，只是想给你一个惊喜派对。你可真是把我们吓坏了，真嗣。”

"Even so," mumbled Shinji as he looked at the streamers that hung from the ceiling and the balloons that floated on the back of the chairs, "isn't this going a little overboard?"  
“即便如此，”真嗣低声说道，目光扫过天花板上悬挂的彩带和椅背上飘浮的气球，“这会不会有点过头了？”

"I tried to tell her that, but she couldn't help herself," sighed Asuka.  
“我试图告诉她，但她就是控制不住，”明日香叹息道。

Misato shot her a frown with a raised eyebrow and said, "What are you talking about? The entire party was your-"  
美里皱着眉头，挑起一边的眉毛对她说：“你在说什么呢？整个派对都是你——”

The rest of her sentence was cut off as Asuka planted her hand over Misato's mouth, silencing her instantly. Though Shinji got the gist, and felt oddly touched by the thought. He didn't think he would have felt the same if it was anybody other than Asuka.  
她的话还没说完，就被明日香用手捂住了嘴，立刻安静了下来。虽然真嗣大致明白了意思，但这个想法让他感到奇怪的感动。如果换成别人，他可能不会有同样的感觉。

"We've got food and drink Shinji," barked Touji who Shinji suspected had tagged along largely for the food, but was all together glad that him and Kensuke had made it. But did that mean that-  
“我们有吃的和喝的，真嗣。”冬二大声说道，真嗣怀疑他主要是为了食物才跟来的，但他还是很高兴他和健介能来。但这意味着——

"...I'm surprised that you guys are here anyway," said Shinji as he reached for a glass of punch. "I thought you weren't supposed to know about the-"  
"...我真没想到你们会在这里，" 真嗣说着伸手去拿一杯潘趣酒。"我以为你们不应该知道关于——"

"Well...we don't know why you had been hospitalized, but we understand that something went wrong with your Eva and you were trapped inside it," said Kensuke  
"嗯...我们不知道你为什么住院，但我们知道你的 Eva 出了问题，你被困在里面了，" 健介说道

Shinji almost spit out his punch at this blatant release of Nerv information. Glancing at Misato, slightly worried, he whispered back, "Did she find out?"  
听到这番对 NERV 机密的直接泄露，真嗣差点把嘴里的潘趣酒喷出来。他瞥了一眼美里，略带担忧地低声问道："她发现了没？"

"I think she's known for a while," said Touji without any worry about whether he could be heard or not. "We asked Asuka what happened to you yesterday at school. Predictably...she told us to go fuck ourselves. She was in a particularly pissy mood yesterday and almost broke a desk over another students back for making fun of you. I think she should have actually...would have been funny as hell."  
"我觉得她早就知道了，" 真嗣说道，丝毫不担心是否会被别人听到。"我们问明日香昨天你在学校发生了什么事。不出所料...她让我们滚蛋。她昨天心情特别糟糕，差点把桌子砸在另一个嘲笑你的学生背上。我觉得她真该那么做...那场面一定搞笑极了。"

"Then what about Hikari?"  
"那光呢？"

"Huh, her? She just sorta tagged along after she heard that we were going to ask Misato personally. I have no idea how much she knows about the Eva's though."  
"她啊？她听说我们要亲自问美里小姐，就跟着一起来了。不过我完全不知道她对 EVA 了解多少。"

Shinji stole a glance over by Hikari and Asuka who were both leaning against the fridge and talking. With Shinji's heightened perception he was able to catch Hikari's eyes flickering over to them occasionally and thought he kinda knew why as her eyes seemed to be directed at Touji. He even caught Asuka's eyes flickering over to himself a few times.  
真嗣偷偷瞥了一眼那边，看见光和明日香正靠在冰箱旁聊天。凭借敏锐的感知，他注意到光偶尔会朝他们这边瞟来，目光似乎是落在冬二身上，这让他隐约猜到了原因。甚至有几次，他捕捉到明日香的目光也朝自己这边闪烁。

"So then what? Misato just told you guys about the Eva's?"  
“那然后呢？美里只是告诉你们关于 EVA 的事吗？”

"Well, she seemed to already guess that we knew too much and just blatantly said that you had been kept at Nerv because of an experiment problem with the Eva's."  
“嗯，她似乎已经猜到我们知道得太多了，就直接挑明说你被留在 NERV 是因为 EVA 实验出了问题。”

Shinji was rather taken aback. He would never have guessed that Misato would have blatantly spoken about the Eva's as though it was suitable for everyday conversation.  
真嗣颇为吃惊。他绝没想到美里会如此直白地谈论 EVA，仿佛这是日常对话的合适话题。

"What about this party then...?"  
“那这个派对呢……？”

Kensuke paused for a minute before looking over at Asuka. Determining that she wouldn't be able to hear him talking, he said, "She'll deny it, but the entire thing was her idea. I guess she heard that you would be released later today and forced Misato to drive her downtown to pick up a few things. Later she called me, Touji, and Hikari and told us that you would be arriving soon. So, we hurried over here..."  
健介顿了一下，然后看向明日香。确定她听不到自己说话后，他说道：“她会否认，但这一切都是她的主意。我猜她听说你今天晚些时候会被释放，就逼美里开车带她去市区买了些东西。后来她给我、阿薰和光打电话，告诉我们你很快就会到。于是，我们急忙赶了过来……”

Kensuke left his sentence dangling as he went back for more punch with Touji following him, his thoughts wrapped around seconds.  
真嗣又偷偷朝明日香和光的方向瞥了一眼，但这次他的目光只锁定在明日香身上。她似乎察觉到了他的注视，因为她微微皱眉，将头发甩到背后，转过身去，让真嗣只能看到她的背影。天啊，她真喜欢逗他。

Shinji stole another glance in Asuka and Hikari's direction, though this time his sights were solely set on Asuka. She seemed to catch him starring though, because she turned her head towards him before grimacing slightly. Throwing her hair behind her back, she turned around so Shinji would have to settle for a rear view. God she liked to tease him.  
健介的话还没说完就回去再倒些潘趣酒，东治跟着他，心里想着再来一杯。

"Not a bad party," said someone suddenly to his left.  
“派对不错嘛。”突然有人在他左边说道。

Turning towards the sound of the voice, Shinji saw a man with brown hair tied back in a pony tail and a few stubbles where a beard would have been. He was wearing a blue work shirt with matching blue jeans. Like Misato, he had a beer in his hand.  
转向声音的来源，真嗣看到一个棕色头发扎成马尾的男人，下巴上有些胡茬。他穿着一件蓝色工作衬衫和配套的蓝色牛仔裤。和美里一样，他手里也拿着一瓶啤酒。

"Kaji," he said while holding out his hand to shake Shinji's.  
“加持先生，”他一边说着，一边伸出手与真嗣握手。

Something seemed to dawn on Shinji as he grasped the man's hand and said, "Aren't you Misato's-"  
当真嗣握住男人的手时，他似乎突然明白了什么，说道：“您不是美里的……”

"Not since our college days."  
"自从大学时代就没这样了。"

Understanding that the subject wasn't one he'd want to elaborate on, he asked instead, "Misato went to college?"  
他明白这个话题他不想多谈，于是转而问道：“美里也上过大学？”

"Yeah. It was me, Misato, and Ritsuko. Course we all split up and worked on our own things. Though somehow we all ended up returning to Nerv."  
“是啊。当时有我、美里和律子。当然我们后来都各奔东西，各自发展。不过不知怎么的，我们最后都回到了 NERV。”

"...You work at Nerv?" "...你在 NERV 工作吗？"

"Yes...but what I do...I can't tell you. I've heard plenty about whats happened since I've been gone. How many angels? Four? I can't understand why they chose now of all times to attack. Though it seems like we don't have to worry with the children piloting the Eva's. We found you, the First Child, and then Asuka, the Second Child was brought here also."  
"是的...但我所做的...我不能告诉你。我离开后听说了许多发生的事情。有多少使徒？四个？我不明白为什么他们偏偏选择这个时候攻击。不过看起来我们不必担心，因为有孩子们在驾驶 EVA。我们找到了你，第一适格者，然后明日香，第二适格者也被带到了这里。"

Something about the way he said Asuka's name seemed to strike a nerv in Shinji.  
他提到明日香名字的方式似乎触动了真嗣的某根神经。

"Do you know Asuka?" "你知道明日香吗？"

"Sorta...I was stationed at the German branch of Nerv for a while and got to know her. I was like a guardian of some kind to her."  
"算是吧...我在德国的 Nerv 分部待过一段时间，那时认识了她。我有点像她的监护人之类的角色。"

Shinji felt a twang of jealousy hit his nerves, but passed it off. Really, thinking about them in any sort of relationship was just being paranoid.  
真嗣感到一阵嫉妒刺痛了他的神经，但他很快将其抛诸脑后。说真的，把他们想象成任何形式的关系都只是自己在瞎猜疑罢了。

Draining the last of his beer, he clapped Shinji on the shoulders and said, "Well, keep up the good work. Everyones depending on you and the other two to defeat the angels."  
喝干最后一口啤酒，他拍了拍真嗣的肩膀说：“嗯，继续努力。大家都在靠你和其他两人来打败使徒。”

As Shinji watched Kaji's retreating back, he was reminded again of why he had chosen to fight. He still couldn't answer that question. He knew that only the generation born after Second Impact was able to control the Eva's. So the adults who helped initiated Second Impact now relied on the younger generation to protect them when retribution came. How foolhardy could they be? Everyone was depending on him, Asuka, and Rei? What if they started rejecting Nerv's orders? Would they be replaced? This thought had never occurred to Shinji before and he wondered what made him suddenly think about this.  
看着加持远去的背影，真嗣再次想起了自己选择战斗的原因。他仍然无法回答这个问题。他知道只有第二次冲击后出生的一代人才能操控 EVA。所以那些帮助引发第二次冲击的成年人现在依赖年轻一代来保护他们，当报应来临时。他们能有多愚蠢？每个人都在依靠他、明日香和绫波？如果他们开始拒绝 NERV 的命令怎么办？他们会被人取代吗？这个念头以前从未在真嗣脑海中出现过，他不知道是什么让他突然想到这一点。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"What," he snapped back without thinking.  
“什么，”他未经思考就厉声回道。

Asuka was looking at him with a frown on her face, but Shinji thought that he could detect hurt in her eyes and suddenly rebuked himself for snapping at her.  
明日香皱着眉头看着他，但真嗣觉得他能在她的眼中察觉到一丝受伤，突然间为自己对她发火而自责。

"Sorry," he mumbled. "I didn't mean to snap at you. Just...thinking about some things."  
“对不起，”他咕哝着。“我不是有意对你发火的。只是……在想一些事情。”

Shrugging, Asuka said, "Forget it and come have some cake."  
明日香耸了耸肩，说道：“算了，过来吃点蛋糕吧。”

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

"Cake moron, Cake! We bought it at the store for you-"  
蛋糕白痴，蛋糕！我们是在店里给你买的——

Touji at this point stuck his head over Asuka's shoulders and said, "Liar. You made that cake yourself Asu-"  
这时，东治从明日香肩后探出头来说：“骗子。那蛋糕是你自己做的，明日——”

Asuka quickly silenced him by stabbing two of her fingers directly into Touji's eyes. Howling with pain, his eyes watering, Touji managed to shout back, "Damn it! What the hell was that for!"  
明日香迅速用两根手指直插东治的眼睛让他闭嘴。痛苦嚎叫的东治泪流满面，勉强回喊道：“该死！你这是干什么！”

"For being an annoying shit," yelled Asuka as she brought her fist down on top of Touji's head.  
“叫你烦人！”明日香大喊着，一拳砸在真嗣的头上。

Shinji couldn't help it, he laughed at Touji's misfortune for upsetting the demon. Though if Touji was correct in what he had been saying...well. Shinji glanced at Asuka out of the corner of his eyes, only to see that her cheeks had turned a light shade of pink.  
真嗣忍不住笑了起来，看着真嗣因为惹恼了小恶魔而倒霉。不过，如果真嗣说的是对的……嗯。真嗣用眼角瞥了一眼明日香，只见她的脸颊微微泛起了红晕。

"Oh forget it," hissed Asuka as she hit Touji upside the head one more time for good measure. Turning towards Shinji, with her forehead slightly creased as though she wasn't sure what she was doing, she grabbed him by his wrist, and dragged him over to the chocolate cake that she had painstakingly made.  
“算了，”明日香低声说着，又给了真嗣脑袋一拳，以示惩戒。她转向真嗣，眉头微皱，似乎不太确定自己在做什么，然后抓住他的手腕，把他拖到她精心制作的巧克力蛋糕前。

Grabbing a plate and jamming it into Shinji's hands, she mumbled, "Here," before spinning around, her hair whipping Shinji across the face, and walked back over to where Hikari was standing.  
她抓起一个盘子，塞进真嗣手里，咕哝着：“给，”然后转过身去，头发甩在真嗣脸上，走回光里站的地方。

'She could have at least waited till I told her what I thought about it,' sighed Shinji as he scooped a piece of it into his mouth.  
“她至少可以等我告诉她我的想法，”真嗣叹了口气，舀了一块放进嘴里。

It was good. Far better than he had expected actually, which he thought seemed a little rude.  
味道不错。比他预想的要好得多，这让他觉得有点失礼。

Finishing up his cake he looked around the kitchen, his eyes falling once again on the balloons and streamers. A smile spread across his face.  
吃完蛋糕后，他环顾厨房，目光再次落在气球和彩带上。他的脸上绽放出笑容。

---

'Really,' he thought as he stepped out of the shower later that day. 'It wasn't so bad I guess...having everyone over.'  
那天晚些时候，当他走出淋浴间时，心里想着：'其实，大家一起来也没那么糟糕...'

Everyone had left sometime ago and Shinji felt immensely better after stepping out of the shower. He felt like he had been contaminated in someway by staying at Nerv all of yesterday, and was just now getting the smell off his skin.  
所有人早已离开，真嗣洗完澡后感觉好多了。他觉得昨天在 NERV 待了一整天，自己仿佛被某种东西污染了，现在才刚刚把那股气味从皮肤上洗掉。

Looking at himself in the mirror, while he dried his hair, he once again found himself looking at the scars that painted his arms. Holding one arm up so that the light hit it better, he frowned at the difference between the pearly white skin, and the slightly tanned sections. He had wondered about it, but never had enough time to check.  
他一边擦干头发，一边对着镜子审视自己，又一次看到了那些遍布双臂的伤疤。他将一只手臂举起，让光线更好地照射，皱眉观察着珍珠般白皙的皮肤与略显晒黑的区域之间的差异。他对此感到好奇，但从未有足够的时间去仔细检查。

Tracing a finger over one of the scars, he measured the length of the scar and then turned his arm over. Measuring the rudimentary line between two scars, each on other sides of his arm, he came to the conclusion that the two scars were from the same piece of glass. But then...how can that be?  
他用手指轻轻划过其中一道疤痕，测量其长度，然后翻转手臂。在两道疤痕之间，分别位于手臂两侧的粗糙线条上比划着，他得出结论，这两道疤痕来自同一块玻璃。但随后...这怎么可能呢？

The pilot and the Eva are connected through the power of synchronization. Thoughts, willpower...whatever. He knew this much. But if an Eva suffers a wound, and it is in turn transferred to the pilot, does the size of the wound get transferred to the pilot? He understood that his case was a rarity, but did that mean that his body could be dismembered, just because the Eva's was? It wasn't a happy thought, but it was one that held meaning nonetheless. He certainly didn't want to imagine himself in a scene where Unit 01 was decapitated, and suddenly his head just popped off like a dolls.  
驾驶员与 Eva 通过同步率的力量相连。思想、意志……诸如此类。他对此心知肚明。但如果 Eva 受伤，伤势会转嫁到驾驶员身上，那么伤口的大小也会一并转移吗？他明白自己的情况实属罕见，但这意味着他的身体会因为 Eva 的肢解而四分五裂吗？这个念头并不愉快，却意义深远。他当然不愿设想初号机被斩首时，自己的头颅也像玩偶一样突然掉落的场景。

"You need to stop worrying yourself so much," he mumbled to the empty bathroom. "Nothing has changed that makes you any diff-"  
“你得少操心些，”他对着空荡荡的浴室喃喃自语，“没什么变化会让你有所不同——”

His thought process froze.  
他的思绪戛然而止。

He had been looking at himself in the mirror, when...no...trick of the lighting. Why would he think his eyes all the sudden flashed scar-  
他一直在镜子前打量自己，突然...不...只是灯光的把戏。为何他会觉得自己的眼睛突然闪现出伤痕——

"Shinji! You done in there!"  
“真嗣！你好了没！”

Asuka's voice came loud through the bathroom door, and rather anxious at that.  
明日香的声音透过浴室门大声传来，显得相当焦急。

Jumping at the sudden volume in her voice, he snapped his head around, but in his enthusiasm to reply, managed to slip on the wet floor, and went tumbling down on his back with a loud thud.  
被她突如其来的大声吓了一跳，他猛地转过头，却在急于回应时，不慎滑倒在湿漉漉的地板上，伴随着一声巨响，重重地摔了个四脚朝天。

"Shinji? ...Oi Baka! What the hell just happened in there!"  
“真嗣？……喂，笨蛋！刚才里面到底发生了什么！”

As Shinji groaned at the pain of his back which had hit hard against the marmoleum floor, he heard a click of the doorknob being turned and realized that he hadn't locked the door.  
真嗣因背部重重撞击在马赛克地板上的疼痛而呻吟，此时他听到门把手转动的咔嗒声，意识到自己忘了锁门。

"Shinji, what the hell-WHAAAH!"  
"真嗣，搞什么鬼——哇啊！"

Asuka took one, maybe two steps into the bathroom, before skidding on the wet floor, and falling backwards on her butt. Opening her eyes tentatively, and wincing slightly at the pain that had coursed through her as she hit the floor, she looked at Shinji who was just propping himself up on his elbows. If she had noticed earlier...well, things would have turned out differently, instead she grimly yelled, "You idiot! Why the hell did you flood the bathroom!"  
明日香刚踏进浴室，也许只走了两步，就在湿滑的地板上滑倒了，一屁股坐在地上。她小心翼翼地睁开眼睛，微微皱眉，感受着摔倒时传遍全身的疼痛。她看着真嗣，他正用肘部支撑着自己起身。如果她早些注意到...好吧，事情可能会有所不同，但她还是气愤地大喊：“你这个白痴！为什么要把浴室弄得水漫金山！”

Shinji stubbornly retorted back, "This always happens. That damn shower doesn't drain the water all the way so some of it comes out onto the floor."  
真嗣倔强地反驳道：“这种情况经常发生。那个该死的淋浴头排水不畅，总有些水流到地板上。”

"I never have any problems with it!"  
"我从来没遇到过任何问题！"

"Which amazes me because you spend almost an hour in there everyday. Its probably clogged from your hair anyway."  
"这让我很惊讶，因为你每天几乎要在里面待上一个小时。可能是因为你的头发堵住了。"

Asuka's anger overflowed here. Standing up briskly, she stood over a naked Shinji who had nothing but a towel covering his privates, bent down, and glared at him before saying, "...It was Misato's hair..."  
绫波的怒气在此爆发。她迅速站起身，站在只用一条毛巾遮住私处的真嗣面前，弯下腰，瞪着他，然后说道：“……是美里小姐的头发……”

The two of them stared at each other for a moment, silence passing between them. Shinji had thought that she was going to step on his unprotected privates, and was still now, unsure of how he should react. Instead, Asuka took the lead.  
两人对视片刻，沉默在彼此间流淌。真嗣原以为她会踩到他毫无保护的私处，此刻仍不确定该如何反应。然而，明日香主动打破了僵局。

Standing up straight, she sighed at him and said, "Whatever, just get the mop and fix this m-m-me-me-WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!"  
她挺直身子，对他叹了口气，说道：“算了，拿拖把来收拾一下这……这……这……这他妈的你到底怎么了！”

Realization had struck Asuka none to gently, as Shinji made to stand up, and only then noticing that the towel was no longer fastened around his waist. Glancing up quickly, he saw a bright red Asuka, who seemed to be frozen in place, with her eyes nothing but sunken sockets. Had it really been that traumatizing?  
明日香突然意识到什么，真嗣正要站起来，这时才注意到腰间的毛巾已经松开。他迅速抬头，只见明日香满脸通红，仿佛僵在原地，双眼空洞无神。真的有那么令人震惊吗？

"Asuka-" "明日香——"

His voice seemed to send her out of her own world, as her face turned a darker shade of red. Breathing heavily, her entire face flushed, she started mumbling uncontrollably under her breath.  
他的声音似乎将她从自己的世界中拉了出来，她的脸变得更红了。呼吸急促，整张脸涨得通红，她开始不由自主地喃喃自语。

"...Asuka?" "...明日香？"

"...Oh God I think I'm gonna puke..." was all she managed to say before she ran out of the bathroom. Shinji could hear retching sounds coming from the kitchen and knew he'd be the one to clean it up later. Wrapping the towel around his waist more securely, he had to admit that he had gotten away with nothing more than a brief outburst.  
"...哦天哪，我想我要吐了..." 这是她跑出浴室前勉强说出的话。真嗣能听到从厨房传来的呕吐声，知道稍后得由他来清理。他更紧地裹住腰间的毛巾，不得不承认自己只是侥幸逃过了一场短暂的爆发。

Asuka meanwhile was hovering over the sink making fake retching noises. She did not want Shinji to see her in such a state, even if it killed her. She _had_ actually been pretty close to puking when she had seen...no...don't think about it. Nothing! Nothing at all. She found it easier to fain ignorance, and just act on emotions. And there were a lot of emotions running through her.  
与此同时，明日香正悬在洗手池上方，发出假装的呕吐声。她不想让真嗣看到自己这副模样，哪怕这会要了她的命。实际上，当她看到...不...别想了。什么都没有！什么都没有。她发现假装无知，只凭情感行事更容易。而此刻她的内心充斥着各种情感。

Looking up as she heard the bathroom door close, she stole a glance behind herself, in time to see Shinji walking down the hallway with a towel wrapped around his waist. She didn't know what she felt, but it was both disgusting and pleasant. Disgusting because it was new to her and because she felt weak because of it, but pleasant because it made her shiver, and not a bad shiver. It was like the kind that goes down your spine; that made you feel suddenly cold but inexplicably warm afterwards.  
听到浴室门关闭的声音，她抬头望去，正好瞥见真嗣腰间裹着毛巾走过走廊。她不知道自己是什么感觉，但既令人厌恶又愉悦。厌恶是因为这对她来说是全新的体验，也因为这种感觉让她感到虚弱，但愉悦是因为它让她颤抖，并非不好的颤抖。就像那种沿着脊椎传来的感觉；让你突然感到寒冷，但随后又莫名地温暖起来。

Turning off the fossett, she let out a weary sigh before slinking into the living room and sinking onto the soft couch.  
关掉水龙头，她疲惫地叹了口气，然后悄悄走进客厅，陷进柔软的沙发里。

'What is wrong with me?' Why does that idiot always resurface in my mind every time I push him away?'  
“我这是怎么了？”为什么每次我试图把他赶走，那个傻瓜总是会重新浮现在我的脑海中？

Rolling over, she intended to flip on the T.V. and absorb herself in whatever was on, when she felt a soft flop somewhere over by her legs, and a shift in the couch cushions. Craning her neck upwards, she saw that Shinji had plopped himself directly in between her spread out legs, with a book in one hand, and his SDAT laying across his knee.  
她翻身打算打开电视，沉浸在任何正在播放的节目中，这时她感觉到腿边有什么柔软的东西一晃而过，沙发垫也跟着移动。她抬头一看，发现真嗣已经一屁股坐在她张开的双腿之间，一手拿着书，SDAT 播放器横放在膝盖上。

It was a mark of how used she was to his presence that Asuka didn't immediately chase him out of the room. She had even...what? Become so used to it that it was enjoyable to be with him? ...Where the hell did that idea come from?  
这表明她已经习惯了他的存在，以至于明日香并没有立即把他赶出房间。她甚至……什么？变得如此习惯以至于和他在一起变得愉快了？……这个念头到底是从哪儿冒出来的？

As her eyes strayed over his body, they fell on the fact that his hair was still dripping wet, his clothing consisting of a pair of shorts and a loose tang top. And-  
当她的目光掠过他的身体时，落在了他的头发依旧滴着水，身上只穿着一条短裤和一件宽松的唐装上衣。而且——

'Enough!' Asuka bellowed in her mind. 'Stop looking at him like that!'  
'够了！'明日香在心中咆哮。'别那样看他！'

Shinji seemed to notice the sudden changes in her facial features out of the corner of his eye. Plucking the earbuds out of his ears he asked, "Something wrong?"  
真嗣似乎注意到了她面部表情的突然变化，从眼角瞥见。他摘下耳塞问道，"怎么了？"

"Not at all," she said testily as she turned her head back to the T.V.  
"一点也不，"她不耐烦地说着，将头转回电视。

Shinji frowned, hoping that her mind wasn't trapped in a time loop that consisted of those few seconds in the bathroom when she might have gotten a glimpse of his...well, best not to worry about that.  
真嗣皱眉，希望她的思维没有被困在一个时间循环中，那个循环只包含她在浴室里可能瞥见他...呃，最好别担心那件事。

Sinking more comfortably into the couch cushions, Shinji brought his feet up and rested them on the edge of the couch cushion he was on. If only he could have seen Asuka's face as it turned several shades of pink before becoming a dark maroon. The ankles of Shinji's feet were making contact with one ofAsuka's ankles.  
真嗣更舒适地沉入沙发垫中，抬起脚放在他坐的沙发垫边缘。如果他能看见明日香的脸，那张脸先是泛起几层粉红，然后变成深酒红色。真嗣的脚踝正触碰到明日香的脚踝。

Asuka had surprising control over her body, (though a complete lack of control over her emotions) as she was able to prevent her body from twitching or becoming completely rigid. Though she felt like her head would soon explode if she didn't do something about his ankle touching her ankle. It felt to similar to footsie.  
明日香对身体有着惊人的控制力，（尽管在情感上完全失控），她能够防止自己的身体抽搐或变得完全僵硬。虽然她感觉如果不对他的脚踝触碰她的脚踝做些什么，她的头很快就会爆炸。这种感觉太像是在玩脚戏了。

Trying as naturally as possible, she pulled herself up and into a sitting position on the couch, effectively moving her legs a good distance away from Shinji's. He didn't even spare her glance as she did this, his mind entirely focused on his book. Though something he had been meaning to tell her seemed to be nagging at the back of his mind. But he couldn't quite remember-  
她尽可能自然地将自己拉起，坐到了沙发上，有效地将双腿从真嗣的身边移开。她这样做时，他甚至没有看她一眼，他的心思完全集中在他的书上。虽然他一直想告诉她的事情似乎在脑海中挥之不去。但他就是记不起来——

'Oh...right,' he thought suddenly.  
'哦...对了，'他突然想到。

Putting his book down and sliding the SDAT off his knees, he turned to Asuka and said, "I had forgotten about it until now, but I had ment to say thank you for the party earlier."  
放下手中的书，将 SDAT 从膝盖上滑落，他转向明日香说道：“我直到现在才想起，我本打算为之前的派对向你道谢的。”

Asuka, who had tensed up slightly when she heard his voice, relax immensely and replied back, "Don't worry about it. Misato helped plenty so you should really be thanking her-"  
明日香听到他的声音时微微紧张了一下，随即放松下来，回答道：“别放在心上。美里帮了不少忙，你真该感谢她——”

"...But you're the one that planned everything and called Touji and the others."  
“……但策划一切并叫来东治和其他人的是你。”

"You make it sound like I did all the hard work. I did all the easy stuff and let Misato do the hard stu-"  
"你这么说好像我做了所有辛苦的工作似的。我只是做了些简单的部分，难的都让美里做了——"

"And the cake. That cake you made...it was really good, far better than any you could have found at the store."  
"还有那块蛋糕。你做的那块蛋糕……真的很好吃，比店里买的任何一块都要好。"

Silence passed for a minute, during which Asuka struggled to get her face a normal shade of color. She was pleased, even grateful for the praise that he had for her. It had honestly been her first time making a cake and she found herself going over in her mind all the ingredients she had used, being sure that she had not forgotten a step.  
沉默持续了一分钟，期间明日香努力让自己的脸色恢复正常。她对得到的赞扬感到高兴，甚至有些感激。这确实是她第一次做蛋糕，她不禁在脑海中反复回想所用的所有原料，确保自己没有遗漏任何步骤。

Getting her emotions under control, she turned towards Shinji and said as cooly as she could muster, "Flattery will get you nowhere."  
她努力控制住情绪，转向真嗣，尽可能冷静地说：“奉承对我没用。”

"...No...I just, thought I'd let you know. ...Thanks."  
“……不……我只是，想让你知道。……谢谢。”

Abandoning her coolness, Asuka grinned back at him and said, "Don't worry about it. I'm just glad you're back."  
阿斯卡放弃了冷静，笑着对他说：“别在意。我只是很高兴你回来了。”

"You're just glad that you didn't have to eat Misato's cooking."  
"你只是庆幸自己不必吃美里做的饭。"

"Well, there's that, and..." Shinji only caught the first part of this as Asuka trailed off at the end, leaving her sentence hanging.  
"嗯，还有...“ 真嗣只听到了前半部分，因为明日香说到最后就停了下来，让她的句子悬而未决。

Though something else was still bothering him. What was it? He knew it had something to do with Asuka...but what?  
尽管还有其他事情困扰着他。那是什么？他知道这与明日香有关...但究竟是什么呢？

Germany! And then it clicked.  
德国！然后一切就明白了。

"Asuka...who was that guy at the party?"  
“明日香...派对上的那个家伙是谁？”

"..."

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"What!" “什么！”

"Who was that guy I didn't know at the party?"  
"在派对上那个我不认识的家伙是谁？"

Asuka seemed as though she would like nothing better to whack Shinji in the head then for interrupting her program. Why was he asking something like that when she had seen them talking?  
明日香看起来恨不得立刻给真嗣一拳，就因为他打断了她的节目。她明明看到他们交谈过，为什么还要问这种问题？

"You already know who he is. His name is Kaji, Kaji Ryoji. You talked to him so why are you asking that? Its irritating."  
"你已经知道他是谁了。他叫加持良治。你和他谈过话的，为什么还要问这个？真烦人。"

"...No...just that when I talked to him, he seemed to know you...because of Germany. So I just wondered..."  
"...不...只是当我跟他交谈时，他似乎认识你...因为德国。所以我只是好奇..."

Asuka was able to abandon the T.V. completely this time and frowned back at Shinji. Was she understanding this correctly? Was Shinji acting jealous?  
这次，明日香完全放弃了电视，皱着眉头回望真嗣。她理解对了吗？真嗣是在吃醋吗？

"What are you implying?" She said with her eyes narrowed. While she was somewhat pleased that he was acting jealous, he felt that it was directed at someone...who just the idea of being with made her want to puke. Kaji was attractive...you know, to people of Misato's age.  
"你在暗示什么？" 她眯起眼睛说道。虽然她有点高兴他吃醋了，但她感觉这针对的是某个人...一想到和那人在一起就让她想吐。加持很有魅力...你知道的，对美里那个年纪的人来说。

"...Nothing," said Shinji hurriedly. "I just wondered-"  
"没什么，" 真嗣急忙说道。"我只是好奇——"

"Then you can stop worrying about something nonexistent. He was someone like a father figure, nothing more. So stop being jealous."  
"那你就不用担心不存在的事情了。他就像一个父亲的形象，仅此而已。所以别再嫉妒了。"

"Jealous? I'm not jealous of him!"  
"嫉妒？我才不会嫉妒他！"

"Well you sure do a great job of play acting then," grimaced Asuka. Now she was just irritated by his irrational thoughts. God he could be so infuriating sometimes.  
"好吧，你演戏的本事确实一流，" 明日香皱着眉头说道。现在她对他的无理取闹感到更加恼火。天哪，他有时真是让人气不打一处来。

"You know what, forget I said anything."  
"你知道吗，当我没说。"

"I'll do just that," said Asuka without another thought on the matter; her previously emotions replaced by ones of annoyance.  
"我正有此意，" 明日香说完便不再多想此事；她先前的情绪已被恼怒所取代。

Annoyed with Asuka's misunderstanding, Shinji stalked off into his own room.  
因明日香误解而感到恼火，真嗣气冲冲地走进自己的房间。

'Jealous,' he thought somewhat savagely. 'No way in hell I'd be jealous because of that.'  
‘嫉妒，’他有些恼怒地想，‘我才不会因为那家伙嫉妒呢。’

'Ah, but you felt something while talking to Kaji,' a voice in his head whispered.  
‘啊，但你在和加持谈话时确实感觉到了什么，’他脑海中的声音低语道。

Ignoring the voice in his head, Shinji laid down in his bed, and turned towards the light of the open window.  
无视脑海中的声音，真嗣躺倒在床上，转向敞开的窗户透进的光亮。

"..."

At what point his thought became dreams, and sleep became a reality, he had no idea. He only knew that it felt as though minutes had past since him and Asuka had parted on a not so friendly note, when he felt himself being shaken awake by Misato.  
他不知道自己的思绪何时变成了梦境，睡眠何时成了现实。他只知道，在与明日香不欢而散后，仿佛只过了几分钟，就被美里摇醒了。

"Shinji...Shinji...wake up."  
“真嗣……真嗣……醒醒。”

Blinking in the dim light of his room he saw Misato leaning over him with a worried expression on her face. In the doorway of his room, he could see a fully dressed and anxious Asuka standing there.  
在昏暗的房间灯光下，他眨了眨眼，看到美里俯身在他上方，脸上带着担忧的表情。在他的房门口，可以看到穿着整齐、神情焦虑的明日香站在那里。

"Whazthematter," he managed to mumble back in his dream like state.  
“怎么了？”他迷迷糊糊地嘟囔着。

Misato's words sent his eyes wide open.  
美里的话让他的眼睛猛地睁大。

"Angel attack. Its due to land in another-," glancing at her watch she said, "-hour. Hurry up. This was totally unexpected and I hate to admit it but caught us completely off guard."  
"天使袭击。预计在一小时后登陆，" 她瞥了一眼手表说道，"快点。这完全出乎意料，虽然我不愿意承认，但我们确实被打了个措手不及。"

Without any sign that he had two girls in his room, Shinji started flinging clothes in every direction as he hurried to get dressed.  
丝毫没有表现出房间里有两个女孩的迹象，真嗣开始慌乱地四处扔衣服，急忙穿好衣服。

"Where is it coming from?" Asked Shinji as he finished buttoning his shirt up.  
"它从哪儿来的？" 真嗣扣好衬衫问道。

"...We picked it up just outside the stratosphere."  
"...我们在平流层外围发现了它。"

"Space?" "太空？"

"Thats what it seems like. Its body's diameter is about the size of Tokyo-3. We believe that it plans to fall on the city, destroying it instantly."  
"看起来是这样。它的身体直径大约和第三新东京市相当。我们相信它打算坠落在城市上，瞬间将其摧毁。"

Shinji starred wide eyed back at her. It could crush it all in seconds unless they did something.  
真嗣瞪大了眼睛回望着她。如果不采取行动，这一切可能在几秒钟内就会被摧毁。

"What are we supposed to-"  
“我们该怎么做——”

"I'll explain on the way. Just get in the car already."  
“路上我会解释的。快上车吧。”

Without giving her another reason to badger him, Shinji hurriedly followed Asuka's retreating back out the door.  
为了避免给她更多理由来纠缠自己，真嗣急忙跟着明日香退去的背影走出了门。

---

An angel attack at one in the morning? Shinji had never heard of anything stranger. He could imagine every citizen in Tokyo-3 being woken by the lady with the annoying voice to telling everybody to evacuated to the shelters. He could just picture Touji's face as he was told he had to go out into the freezing cold night. It made him smile...though it was only for a moment.  
凌晨一点的天使袭击？真嗣从未听说过比这更奇怪的事。他可以想象东京-3 的每一位市民都被那个烦人的声音吵醒，被告知要疏散到避难所。他甚至能想象出当被告知必须外出到寒冷的夜晚时，东治脸上的表情。这让他微笑了一下...尽管只是一瞬间。

The fact was they had a crisis on there hands. The angel had caught them so off guard that they barely had time to prepare for anything. Then there was the fact that the commander, Shinji's father, was not there. He had left for Antarctica apparently to search for something. What it was, Shinji had no idea.  
事实是他们面临一场危机。天使的突袭让他们措手不及，几乎没有时间做任何准备。此外，指挥官，也就是真嗣的父亲，并不在场。他显然是去了南极寻找某样东西。至于那是什么，真嗣一无所知。

Something that worried Shinji the most though, was that this would be the first time that all three pilots would be working together. He didn't find this as a problem...but he certainly thought that Asuka did. She had been pissed when Misato had explained the plan, putting great emphasis on the fact that all three Eva's would have to work together in order to defeat it.  
然而，最让真嗣担心的是，这将是三位驾驶员首次共同作战。他并不认为这是个问题……但他确信明日香肯定不这么想。当美里解释计划时，她非常强调所有三台 Eva 必须协同作战才能击败使徒，这让明日香非常恼火。

It seemed like suicide, but it was feasible. The angel was the size of Tokyo-3...and that proved a problem. Misato, however, had come up with a bold plan to combat the sheer size of the angel, dubbed Sahaquiel. The three Eva's would work together to produce one large AT-field to slow the angel down. Then the other two Eva's would project a strong enough AT-field, that would open a small hole that one of the Eva's would be able to tare through. The Eva (and here, Shinji felt that it would be his job ultimately) that was chosen for this last part, would produce a cone like AT-field to slash the angel in two, and destroy the core. At least, this was how it was supposed to work in theory.  
这看似是自杀行为，但却是可行的。使徒的体型与东京-3 相当……这确实是个难题。不过，美里制定了一个大胆的计划来对抗使徒萨哈奎尔的庞大身躯。三台 Eva 将协同工作，生成一个巨大的 AT 力场来减缓使徒的速度。然后，另外两台 Eva 将投射出一个足够强大的 AT 力场，打开一个小洞，让其中一台 Eva 能够撕裂进去。被选中的那台 Eva（在这里，真嗣觉得最终会是他的任务）将产生一个锥形的 AT 力场，将使徒一分为二，并摧毁核心。至少，理论上应该是这样。

Now, Shinji found himself in the entry plug of Unit 01, and had to force himself to pilot it, after he had been inside of it last time.  
现在，真嗣发现自己身处初号机的插入栓内，不得不强迫自己再次驾驶它，上次他在里面时的经历让他心有余悸。

'Relax,' he told himself. 'Just picture this as another synchronization test.' Then he remembered what had happened with the last test, and quickly abandoned that thought.  
'放松，'他对自己说。'就把这当成另一次同步测试吧。'随即他想起了上次测试发生的事情，迅速打消了这个念头。

Stepping onto the elevator that would take him to the surface, he glanced at Unit 00, and 02. All three of them were being sent up at different points. The exact spot that the angel would land was still being determined by Nerv computers. The idea was that, if they were sent up at all different points, either one of them would be able to reach the angel before it landed.  
踏进通往地面的电梯，他瞥了一眼零号机和二号机。他们三台机体将在不同时间点被送上去。天使的确切着陆点仍由 NERV 的计算机确定。计划是，如果他们从不同地点出发，那么至少有一台机体能在天使落地前到达。

Misato's voice suddenly came over the intercom, "We have determined the strike point of the target. Distance is 20,000 meters...Asuka you will be the nearest to the crash site. Be the first one there."  
美里突然通过对讲机传来指令，"我们已经确定了目标的打击点。距离为 20,000 米...明日香，你离坠落点最近。务必第一个到达。"

"I'd naturally be the first one there even if I wasn't the closest to it."  
"我自然会是第一个到达的，哪怕我不是离它最近的。"

Misato ignored her comment.  
美里无视了她的评论。

"Okay then...Unit 00 send up elevator shaft number one. Unit 01...elevator number five, and Unit 02...elevator shaft number three. Mission start!"  
"那么好吧...零号机使用一号电梯井。初号机...使用五号电梯，二号机...使用三号电梯井。任务开始！"

Feeling the familiar jerk behind his navel, Shinji rocket up several hundred feet before striking the surface. The umbilical cord immediately became detached and Shinji rocketed forward.  
感受到熟悉的腹部拉扯感，真嗣如火箭般冲上数百英尺，随后撞击在地面上。脐带电缆立即断开，真嗣疾速向前冲去。

He had never moved this fast while in Eva, and admittedly he was the furthest from the strike point. The feet of Unit 01 dug up such large quantities of dirt and debris, that it seemed as though its feet was one large shovel.  
他从未在 Eva 中移动得如此迅速，而且坦白说，他离撞击点最远。初号机的双脚掘起了大量泥土和碎片，仿佛它的双脚就是一把巨大的铲子。

Skidding to a sudden a halt, Unit 01 kicked off against the ground again, change it direction to the strike point. Soaring over power lines, shattering windows, sending cars flying. Shinji wondered how much they were really saving the city. Surely it costed millions if not billions of dollars to repair everything that they destroy during an angel attack.  
突然急停后，初号机再次蹬地，改变方向朝撞击点冲去。飞越电线，击碎窗户，将汽车抛向空中。真嗣不禁思考，他们究竟为这座城市节省了多少。毫无疑问，每次使徒袭击造成的破坏，修复费用高达数百万甚至数十亿美元。

As Shinji got closer to the strike point he looked up at the sky and finally saw the angel. It looked like a giant eye, but with wings...or feathers? Shinji wasn't really sure what was the better description. However his thoughts were suddenly shoved aside as he heard Misato's worried voice on the intercom.  
当真嗣接近攻击点时，他抬头望向天空，终于看到了那个使徒。它看起来像一只巨大的眼睛，但带着翅膀...还是羽毛？真嗣不太确定哪种描述更贴切。然而，他的思绪突然被通讯器中传来的美里担忧的声音打断。

"Targets position has been revised, change point to five kilometer east of its original position.  
目标位置已修正，变更点为其原位置以东五公里。

"Not good! I won't be able to make it in time!" Asuka yelled over the intercom.  
不好了！我来不及赶到了！"明日香在通讯器中喊道。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"...I can make it. Give me the position, Misato."  
"...我可以做到的。把位置给我，美里。"

With the coordinates relayed, Unit 01 took off at an amazing speed, creating a jet stream behind itself.  
坐标传送完毕后，零一号机以惊人的速度起飞，身后留下一道喷射流。

Shinji could now definitely see that the angel had changed its position, but was still worried that he might no be able to make it.  
真嗣现在可以肯定天使改变了位置，但仍然担心自己可能无法及时赶到。

Putting on another burst of speed, Shinji ripped through the pavement of Tokyo-3, no longer carrying about the power lines. Wild life and even trees seemed to serve out of his way, as he crossed a mountain and entered the East side of Tokyo-3.  
再次加速，真嗣撕裂了东京-3 的地面，不再顾及电线。野生动物甚至树木似乎都为他让路，他翻越了一座山，进入了东京-3 的东侧。

Skidding down the face of the mountain, he had Unit 01 dig its heels into the ground, slowing it down quickly. Now Shinji could almost see directly underneath the angel and knew that he was almost at the crash site.  
沿着山坡滑下，他让初号机将脚跟插入地面，迅速减速。现在真嗣几乎能直接看到天使的下方，知道他快到坠落地点了。

Slamming to a sudden halt, he looked directly up into the eye of the angel and saw a brief flash of orange before the angel created an AT-field. Mimicking its movements he shouted, "AT-field. Full power!"  
突然停下，他直视着天使的眼睛，看到一瞬间的橙色闪光，随后天使展开了 AT 力场。模仿其动作，他大喊：“AT 力场，全功率！”

The ground beneath Unit 01 crumbled and flew into the air before being disintegrated by the clash of the two AT-fields. A large shockwave went flying in all directions, ripping apart the foundations of nearby buildings, and taring the roots of trees out of the ground.  
初号机脚下的地面崩裂，碎石在两股 AT 力场的碰撞中化为齑粉。一股强大的冲击波向四周扩散，摧毁了附近建筑的地基，连根拔起了地面上的树木。

Shinji could feel that he was being pushed to the ground though, and confirmed this thought as he felt one of Unit 01 legs collapse and go kneeling to the ground. Feeling a sudden pain shoot through his own legs, he hoped that he his bones didn't just snap in two also.  
尽管如此，真嗣能感觉到自己被压倒在地，当看到初号机的一条腿跪下时，他确认了这一点。突然间，他感到腿部一阵剧痛，希望自己的骨头没有因此断裂。

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

Asuka came flying into view from the West, before standing next to Shinji and projecting her own AT-field, effectively enabling him to stand up again.  
明日香从西边飞驰而来，站在真嗣旁边，展开自己的 AT 力场，帮助他重新站立起来。

"You idiot, don't go killing yourself before I get here."  
"你这个白痴，别在我到之前就把自己搞死了。"

"Forget it and just concentrate."  
"别想了，专心点。"

"Don't tell me what to-"  
"别命令我——"

Her words were silenced as the angel gave a large jolt, and propelled itself closer to the ground. Both Eva's sank to there knees suddenly and Shinji felt pain in his legs again.  
天使猛地一震，加速向地面靠近，两人的话语戛然而止。伊娃们突然跪倒在地，真嗣再次感到双腿剧痛。

"Damn it!" Yelled Asuka. "Where is the pet!"  
“该死！”明日香大喊，“那宠物在哪儿！”

"Ikari-kun..." “碇君……”

Unit 01 with Rei came in from the North before standing on Shinji's left, projecting her own AT-field. The combination of the three sent the angel reeling backwards for a second, before rightening itself and continuing the assault  
01 号机与绫波从北方赶来，站在真嗣左侧，展开了自己的 AT 力场。三者的合力让使徒一时后退，随即又稳住身形，继续攻击。

"So where all here...now what!"  
“所以大家都到齐了……接下来怎么办！”

"One of us has to destroy this thing while the other two give them a window to attack."  
“我们中必须有人摧毁这东西，而另外两人则提供攻击的窗口。”

"Okay you two do that. I'm gonna destroy this thing."  
"好了，你们俩继续。我要毁了这玩意儿。"

"No, I'm doing it," Shinji yelled back at Asuka.  
"不，我来干，" 真嗣对明日香吼道。"

"Who the fuck decided on that!"  
"谁他妈决定的那个！"

"Just hurry...already..."  
"快点...已经..."

Shinji thought he heard a strain in Rei's voice. He hadn't considered her thoughts.  
真嗣觉得他听出了丽声音中的一丝紧张。他之前没有考虑过她的想法。

"Asuka just let me do this!"  
"明日香，就让我这么做吧！"

"Damn it! If you die I'll swear on your fucking grave that I said I'd do it."  
"该死！如果你死了，我发誓会在你的坟头上说我已经尽力了。"

'I'll remember that..." '我会记住的..."

Releasing the AT-field for no more than a few seconds, Shinji gave Asuka and Rei more than enough time to carrying out there own steps.  
仅释放 AT 力场几秒钟，真嗣给了明日香和丽足够的时间来执行他们各自的步骤。

Separating the one AT-field into two different ones, Asuka and Rei slammed the two AT-fields into the angels, both focusing on a different part. The angel was forced to focus on separate points in the AT-field, moving the brunt of its power to the points that Asuka and Rei were working on, making the dead center weak.  
将一个 AT 力场分割成两个不同的部分，明日香和绫波同时将这两个 AT 力场猛击向使徒，各自集中攻击不同的部位。使徒被迫在 AT 力场上分散注意力，将大部分力量转移到明日香和绫波攻击的点上，使得中心区域变得薄弱。

Disengaging both their AT-fields simultaneously, Asuka and Rei created one large one, and wrenched open a hole in the dead center of the angels before it was able to react.  
明日香和绫波同时解除各自的 AT 力场，创造出一个巨大的力场，并在使徒反应过来之前，在中心区域撕开了一个洞。

Shinji moved suddenly to that with a flash of scarlet in his eyes.  
真嗣突然行动起来，眼中闪过一抹猩红。

Meanwhile, in the command center, Ritsuko showed Misato something confusing just before Shinji started his attack.  
与此同时，在指挥中心，律子在真嗣发起攻击前向美里展示了一些令人困惑的东西。

"Misato...you might want to see this..."  
“美里……你或许该看看这个……”

"What?" "什么？"

As Misato walked over to the computer she glanced at the monitor of the Eva's exactly thirty-seconds remained in the activation period. 'It should be enough time,' she thought.  
当美里走向电脑时，她瞥了一眼 EVA 的监控屏幕，激活期还剩三十秒。‘应该足够了，’她心想。

As she reached the monitor Ritsuko was examining though, everything else left her mind, and she realized the danger in the numbers.  
当她走到丽津子正在检查的监视器前时，其他一切都从她脑海中消失了，她意识到了数字中的危险。

"This was the recorded plug depth during the last synchronization test of Unit 01, which was unusually high at the time."  
“这是零一机在上次同步测试中记录的插入深度，当时异常偏高。”

The number read sixty. 数字显示为六十。

"This is the current number...and its still climbing."  
"这是当前的数字...还在不断上升。"

The number read eighty. 数字显示为八十。

"...Shinji's entering the contamination zone...but why? Is he choosing to on his own?"  
"...真嗣进入了污染区...但为什么？是他自己选择的吗？"

"Its the only reason that I can understand."  
"这是我能理解的唯一理由。"

"But why? There's no reason for doing something like this. If he continues on he wont remain-"  
"但为什么？这样做毫无理由。如果他继续下去，他将不再——"

"-human," asked Ritsuko with no expression on her face.  
"——保持人性，" 赤城瑞穗面无表情地问道。"

Misato frowned heavily at Ritsuko. Did she know something that she didn't know about Shinji?  
美里皱着眉头看向律子。她是不是知道一些自己不了解的关于真嗣的事情？

Back at the battle, Shinji had just disengaged his attack as Asuka and Rei rushed in. If it had to be someone...it might as well be him.  
回到战场，真嗣刚刚解除攻击，明日香和绫波就冲了进来。如果非得是某个人...那还不如是他。

'An angels AT-field is an extension of itself, and if my body is an extension of the Eva's...then does that mean that I have an AT-field? Do all humans have an AT-field that lets them distinguish themselves from other humans?' For some strange reason he thought he has had a similar discussion like this before.  
'使徒的 AT 力场是其自身的延伸，如果我的身体是 EVA 的延伸...那么这是否意味着我也有 AT 力场？所有人类是否都有 AT 力场，让他们能够区分自己和其他人？'出于某种奇怪的原因，他觉得自己以前似乎有过类似的讨论。

His eyes flashed scarlet for a brief moment as he thought this and briefly sensed a changed in the LCL fluid in the entry plug. It became more dense, like it actually had a definable substance.  
他的眼中闪过一瞬猩红，心中思绪涌动，同时察觉到插入栓内 LCL 液体的变化。它变得更加浓稠，仿佛真的有了可辨认的实体。

Looking up he quickly caught Unit 00 and 02 movements and reacted instinctively at that.  
他抬头迅速捕捉到零号机和二号机的动作，本能地做出了反应。

Shoving one arm of the Eva up to its elbow, into the small window that he Asuka and Rei managed to create, he projected a large cone that covered everything from the Eva's elbow and below to the tips of its fingers.  
他将 EVA 的一只手臂推至肘部，伸入他与明日香和绫波共同创造的小窗口，投射出一个巨大的锥形屏障，覆盖了 EVA 肘部以下至指尖的所有部位。

Forcing the AT-field open was only the first part. Next, Shinji put all of his thought into widening the cone like AT-field and separating the angel in half. He got about as far as that when a new AT-field of the angels suddenly slammed into the cone like one, shattering it instantly.  
强行打开 AT 力场只是第一步。接下来，真嗣全神贯注地试图扩大锥形 AT 力场，将使徒一分为二。然而就在此时，使徒突然释放出新的 AT 力场，猛烈撞击锥形力场，瞬间将其击碎。

Unit 01 went stumbling backwards as Shinji screamed in pain as he felt the ends of the Eva's fingers snap.  
初号机踉跄后退，真嗣痛苦地尖叫，他感觉到 EVA 手指的末端断裂了。

Asuka and Rei rushed forward but were sent kneeling to the ground as the full might up the angels AT-field was sent crashing down on top of them.  
明日香和绫波丽冲上前去，却被使徒 AT 力场的全力压制击倒在地，跪了下来。

As Shinji looked back at the angel, hopelessness started to settle in the bottom of his stomach. Could they even win against something this powerful? Would it even matter? Surely another stronger angel was sure to come after this one and they be facing the same problem.  
当真嗣回头看向天使时，绝望感开始在他的胃底蔓延。他们能战胜如此强大的存在吗？这真的重要吗？肯定会有更强大的天使紧随其后，他们将再次面临同样的困境。

"Shinji, what the fuck do you think you're doing!"  
“真嗣，你他妈以为自己在干什么！”

Asuka's mad voice seemed wake him up and he blinked his eyes open as he saw Unit 00 and 02 go crashing to their knees. He could see the veins around the Eva's arms and knew that the contamination had started.  
明日香愤怒的声音似乎唤醒了他，他眨眼睁开眼睛，看到零号机和二号机轰然跪地。他能看到 EVA 手臂上的青筋，知道污染已经开始。

But what was he supposed to-  
但他到底应该怎么做——

"Shinji damn it! You said you could handle this, so back your fucking words up with your actions."  
"真嗣，该死！你说过你能处理好这件事的，那就用行动来证明你的话。"

...She was right. What was he doing? He said he would handle it and now he was running away. Just like he had done with everything else in his life.  
...她说得对。他在做什么？他曾说他能处理好，现在却在逃避。就像他一生中对待其他所有事情一样。

As Asuka and Rei were tossed aside, Shinji's eyes turned to the color of blood red.  
当明日香和绫波被甩到一旁时，真嗣的眼睛变成了血红色。

The plug depth had just passed one hundred.  
插入栓深度刚刚超过一百。

Rushing forward, Shinji slid underneath the angel and extended both the Eva's arms and projected a dome like AT-field over himself, the other two, and all within a two kilometer radius.  
真嗣冲向前，滑到使徒下方，同时伸展 EVA 的双臂，并在自己、另外两人以及两公里半径内的所有人上方投射出一个穹顶状的 AT 力场。

The angel stopped dead in its tracks and jolted backwards for a second. Following up on his initial attack, Shinji forcefully created another AT-field, separate from the first one, and opened up a small hole at the top of the dome like first AT-field. Just by thinking it, he was now able to achieve what he wanted.  
天使突然停下脚步，猛地向后一震。紧随其后的攻击中，真嗣强行创造出另一个 AT 力场，与第一个分开，并在其穹顶顶部打开一个小洞。只需一想，他便能达成所愿。

Forming it into a small spherical shape, he sent it flying straight through the hole that he had made moments before, ripping apart the outer layer of flesh of the angel. A small trickle of blood started to flow out of the wound that the angel had suffered. But why should it worry about something so minuscule.  
将其塑成一个小球状，他让它直穿之前制造的洞口，撕裂了天使的外层肉体。一丝鲜血开始从天使受创的伤口流出。但为何要为如此微不足道的事担忧。

Next second a large chunk of the angels flesh was blown away, as the spherical AT-field erupted inside of it. Blood and organs slithered out of the open wound, painting the streets and buildings of Tokyo-3 scarlet. If the angel had a voice, Shinji was sure that it would be shrieking in agony.  
下一秒，天使的一大块肉被球形 AT 力场在其内部引爆而炸飞。血液和内脏从敞开的伤口中滑出，将东京-3 的街道和建筑染成猩红。如果天使有声音，真嗣确信它会发出痛苦的尖叫。

Before it was able to regenerate, Shinji slammed Unit 01's hand into the bloody pocket of flesh and blood that he had created moments before. And created the cone like AT-field that he had original tried, except now it was as large as the angel.  
在它能够再生之前，真嗣将初号机的手猛地插入他刚刚制造的血肉模糊的口袋中。他尝试着创造了一个锥形 AT 力场，只是这次它的规模与使徒相当。

Tendons, nerves, and tissue were able to be seen as the angel split in two separate part, before exploding in a large burst of blood and gore. Shinji felt the wave of gore engulf him, as it flew in all directions, turning Unit 01 into colors suitable for Unit 02.  
肌腱、神经和组织清晰可见，使徒被分成了两部分，随后爆炸成一大片血肉横飞。真嗣感到血肉浪潮将他吞没，向四面八方飞溅，将初号机染成了适合二号机的颜色。

Breathing heavily, he looked at the sea of gore splashed in all direction and finally knew that it was over. But what happened exactly?  
他喘着粗气，看着四处飞溅的血海，终于明白一切都结束了。但究竟发生了什么？

His eyes were back to there usual brown color.  
他的眼睛又恢复了平常的棕色。

...Had he done this? If he had to describe it, it looked like something out of a very gory slasher film. He could remember watching it, but it felt like he had been seeing it all from a third perspective. What had he done? He remembered Asuka yelling at him...and then what? He had moved with such ease that it felt as though it were floating. He thought what he wanted, and it happened. But then...the two AT-fields. Had he created one of those himself? Was it because of being inside Unit 01 that he was able to? Maybe an Eva was able to generate two AT-fields...  
...这是他做的吗？如果要形容的话，这场景就像是从一部非常血腥的恐怖片里出来的。他记得自己看过，但感觉像是用第三者的视角在看。他到底做了什么？他记得明日香对他大喊...然后呢？他移动得如此轻松，仿佛在漂浮。他想什么，什么就发生了。但之后...那两个 AT 力场。是他自己创造了一个吗？是因为他在零一机体内才能做到的吗？或许一台 EVA 能产生两个 AT 力场...

"I don't...know..." “我不...知道...”

What the fuck was happening to him?  
他妈的到底发生了什么？

"...Shinji..." "...真嗣..."

"I don't know damn it. Leave me alone already..."  
"我不知道，该死的。别管我了..."

"Ikari-kun?" "碇君？"

"Don't talk to me! I don't want to talk to anyone! Just leave me alone!"  
"别跟我说话！我不想和任何人说话！让我一个人待着！"

"Shinji, wake the fuck up!"  
"真嗣，醒醒吧！"

Shinji opened his eyes. He was crying.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛。他在哭泣。

"...You defeated it...its gone..."  
“……你打败了它……它消失了……”

Why was he crying? 他为何在哭泣？

"You can stop now!" "你可以停下了！"

Why should he be crying over something so insignificant?  
他为何要为如此微不足道的事情哭泣？

"Stop destroying what remains of it damn it!"  
"别再毁掉它仅存的部分了，该死！"

Why the fuck should he be crying over the remains of an angel!  
他妈的为什么要为天使的遗骸哭泣！

Tears streaked down his face as he repeatedly pummeled and tore apart the bones and organs of what remained of the angel.  
泪水顺着他的脸颊滑落，他不断地捶打并撕扯着天使残存的骨头和器官。

'Why am I crying?' He wondered. 'I should be glad that this is over, not sad. I could have died. Everyone could have died. Yet why the fuck am I crying over an angels corpse!'  
‘我为什么在哭？’他疑惑着。‘我应该为这一切结束而高兴，而不是悲伤。我本可能死去。所有人本可能死去。可他妈的为什么我要为一个天使的尸体哭泣！’

"Shinji enough already," said Misato over the intercom.  
“真嗣，够了，”美里通过对讲机说道。

"Cut all power and synchronization between Unit 01 and the pilot. If this continues on he may be permanently contaminated," said Ritsuko.  
“切断零号机与驾驶员之间所有的电源和同步连接。如果这种情况继续下去，他可能会永久性地受到污染，”律子说道。

Shinji suddenly felt Unit 01 shudder violent, and everything went black.  
真嗣突然感觉到零号机剧烈颤抖，随后一切陷入黑暗。

---

Yet...everything was still black...  
然而...一切仍是漆黑一片...

Wait, no, that wasn't quite right. A light was coming from behind him, and a very bright light at that.  
等等，不对，情况并非完全如此。一束光线正从他身后射来，而且是非常明亮的光。

The room slowly came into focus and Shinji started to become aware of his surroundings. He was laying down on the couch in Misato's apartment, and seemed to be tucked warmly under a blanket while a pillow was propped behind his head.  
房间渐渐清晰起来，真嗣开始意识到周围的环境。他正躺在美里公寓的沙发上，身上盖着温暖的毯子，头下还垫着一个枕头。

Sitting up slowly, he winced as pain shot through his fingers and knees, though it wasn't as bad as he might have expected.  
他缓缓坐起身，当疼痛穿过手指和膝盖时，他皱了皱眉，但并没有他预想的那么糟糕。

Looking around the first things that he recognize was that: The T.V. was on and muted, second: Asuka was sitting in a chair that looked to be from the kitchen, and facing the T.V. Though she certainly didn't seem to be awake In fact, her head was drooping off to the side a little.  
环顾四周，他首先注意到的是：电视开着但静音了，其次：明日香坐在一把看起来像是厨房用的椅子上，面朝电视。不过她显然没有醒着，事实上，她的头微微偏向一侧，垂了下来。

Even though the lighting was a bit weak, Shinji was still able to see Asuka's beautiful face as she slept with a smile on her face. He then noticed that no matter what her face looked like, it seemed that she had spent several anxious hours sitting on that chair. Her hair was a disheveled mess, while the baggy shirt she was wearing was hanging halfway down one of her shoulders, enabling Shinji to see the white bra strap underneath. He had a sudden strange urge to lean over and tuck a locket of her hair behind her ear.  
尽管光线有些昏暗，真嗣仍能清晰地看到明日香熟睡时美丽的脸庞上带着微笑。随后他注意到，无论她的脸庞如何，她似乎已经在那把椅子上焦虑地坐了几个小时。她的头发凌乱不堪，而她穿着的那件宽松衬衫半边滑落，露出了下面的白色胸罩带。他突然有种奇怪的冲动，想俯身将她的一缕头发撩到耳后。

'...Where the hell did that come from?' He wondered.  
“……这他妈是从哪儿冒出来的？”他疑惑道。

Sitting up more promptly he looked around the room a few more times, (his gaze resting on Asuka several times) before he looked down at his own hands. Why did he feel so...revolted? Was it because of his thoughts earlier, of how it might have been possible to _save_ the angel. Had anybody ever thought that it was just one giant misunderstanding between the human race and the angel? Of course not, because it was, 'they exist and are evil. We exist and are righteous.' The thought made him sick.  
他更加迅速地坐起身，环顾房间几次（目光多次停留在明日香身上），然后低头看着自己的双手。为何他感到如此……厌恶？是因为他早先的想法吗，关于如何可能拯救那位天使。是否有人曾想过，这不过是人类与天使之间的一个巨大误会？当然没有，因为这是，“它们存在且邪恶。我们存在且正义。”这个念头让他感到恶心。

Sinking back down into the couch cushions he turned his head towards Asuka, only to receive a shocking revelation that her eyes were open, and her forehead was pressed lightly against his. She didn't look to thrilled though to see him awake.  
他重新陷进沙发垫里，转头看向明日香，却震惊地发现她的眼睛是睁开的，额头轻轻贴着他的。不过，看到他醒来，她似乎并不怎么高兴。

"...Ahh...hey Asu-" "...啊...嘿，阿苏-"

"FUCKING MORON!" "蠢货！"

Shinji received a hard jab to his ribcage and doubled over in pain. What the hell had he done to deserve this?  
真嗣的肋骨被狠狠一击，痛得弯下了腰。他到底做了什么要受这种罪？

"Bastard! Ass-hole! You've been completely unconscious for over a day and you just sit up and say hey?"  
"混蛋！王八蛋！你已经完全昏迷超过一天了，刚一醒过来就打个招呼？"

"...Over a day?" "...超过一天？"

"Yes over a day you fucking idiot. I've left this chair for two reasons, one: to go to the bathroom, and two: to get food and bring it back here. My eyes are blood shot from watching T.V. and jerking around every time you mumbled in your sleep or changed your body positions. Do you have any idea how stressed out I am right now!  
"是的，超过一天，你这个该死的白痴。我离开这椅子只有两个原因，一是去洗手间，二是去弄点吃的带回来。我的眼睛因为看电视和每次你睡觉时嘟囔或改变姿势而紧张得充血。你知道我现在有多紧张吗！"

"No...but I think my ribs do."  
"不...但我觉得我的肋骨可能断了。"

"I swear to God, I am going to beat you within an inch of your life, spare you, and then repeat the same thing over the next day."  
"我向上帝发誓，我会把你打到只剩一口气，饶你一命，然后第二天再重复一遍。"

"I don't think my body will hold up even after one day."  
"我觉得我的身体连一天都撑不住。"

"I've slept an entire two fucking hours since yesterday!"  
"从昨天起我就他妈的只睡了整整两个小时！"

"I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that I did nothing but sleep for an entire day."  
"我还在努力接受我一整天什么都没干，光睡觉了这个事实。"

"I wouldn't call it sleeping so much as a coma. We weren't sure if you had been contaminated or not."  
"与其说是睡觉，不如说是昏迷。我们当时不确定你是否被污染了。"

"Well I'm fine, so you don't have to get so anxious."  
"好吧，我没事，所以你不必这么焦虑。"

"Do you even care how I felt?"  
"你有没有在乎过我的感受？"

"Course I do. But I'm fine so I don't see a need to overreact-"  
"当然在乎。但我没事，所以我觉得没必要反应过度——"

"Overreact? This is normal! Anybody would have been worried about someone that-"  
"反应过度？这很正常！任何人都会担心那个——"

"-means a lot to you?"  
"——对你意义重大的人？"

Asuka paused for a minute, before taking in a deep breath and saying, "Yes...okay. You mean a lot to me, damn it."  
明日香顿了一下，深吸一口气后说道，“是的...好吧。你对我来说意义重大，该死。”

"And you mean a lot to me too Asuka."  
"你对我也很重要，明日香。"

The sharp intake of breath was all Shinji need to know that Asuka had heard him correctly. But God was he feeling tired again.  
那一瞬间的深吸气足以让真嗣知道明日香听清楚了他的话。但天啊，他又感到疲惫了。

"Hey Asuka..." "嘿，明日香……"

"What?" "什么？"

"...Thanks." "...谢谢。"

"Whatever...at least I can sleep better tonight since I know you haven't turned into a corpse."  
"随便吧...至少我知道你还没变成尸体，今晚能睡个好觉了。"

"Speaking of sleep, I feel tired again."  
"说到睡觉，我又感觉累了。"

"What? You just slept for an entire day. How can you still be tired?"  
"什么？你已经睡了一整天了。怎么还会累呢？"

"Well it is night so its natural that I'd sleep."  
"嗯，现在是晚上，自然会想睡觉。"

"I suppose. Well, I'm sleeping in my room tonight. That chair gives me back pains."  
"我想也是。好吧，今晚我要睡在我的房间里。那把椅子让我背疼。"

Asuka turned to get up, when Shinji grabbed ahold of her wrist."  
明日香转过身准备起身，这时真嗣抓住了她的手腕。

"Wha-" "什-"

"Stay here for a while..."  
“在这里待一会儿吧……”

Asuka's face flushed pink for a second before turning back to its usual color.  
明日香的脸颊瞬间泛起粉红，随后又恢复了平常的颜色。

"Fine," she sighed. "But only for a little while. I want to sleep properly tonight."  
"好吧，"她叹了口气。"但只能一会儿。我今晚想好好睡一觉。"

"Hmm. Okay." "嗯，好吧。"

Shifting into a more comfortable position, Shinji looked at his hands once more before turning to Asuka and holding out the hand closest to the edge of the couch.  
调整到一个更舒适的姿势，真嗣再次看着自己的手，然后转向明日香，伸出离沙发边缘最近的那只手。

Raising an eyebrow, Asuka said, "What?"  
明日香挑了挑眉，问道："什么？"

"...Just hold my hand for a while."  
"...就握一会儿我的手吧。"

"...You sound like a child...but all right, whatever."  
"...你听起来像个孩子...不过好吧，随你。"

Grabbing Shinji's hand none to gently she frowned down at it for a minute before deciding where to place it. Cupping his hand in both of hers, she gently rested them on her lap.  
她不太温柔地抓住真嗣的手，皱着眉头看了一会儿，然后决定把它放在哪里。她用双手捧着他的手，轻轻地放在自己的腿上。

Neither of them moved from that spot that night, and yet, she was still able to get a good nights rest.  
那一夜，他们谁也没有离开那个地方，然而，她依然能够安然入睡。

### Chapter 12: Hurtful Changes

**Thanks for everyone patience while they waited for this. I woke up at 10 when my alarm hit...but ended up sleeping for another three hours. There was no possible way to get it out till now. Also this has not been proofread in anyway so don't be surprised if you see missing words. I'm gonna fix it tomorrow, but in a minute I'm going to sleep. (I think I actually caught a cold doing a double post and I got it done in four days)  
感谢大家的耐心等待。我十点被闹钟叫醒...结果又睡了三个小时。直到现在才有可能发布。此外，这还没有经过任何校对，所以如果看到遗漏的词，请不要惊讶。我明天会修正，但现在我得去睡觉了。（我觉得我因为连续发帖真的感冒了，而且我四天内完成了它）**

**So...this chapter is a very heavy M and I actually cut some stuff out because, quite frankly, I thought the possibility of it being too graphic would get it taken down. With that out of the way this chapter contains...well you can read and find out. At one point I will have a disclaimer though so people can skip that part if they want to. Just look for the bold letters at the beginning at end of the section. I'll give a very brief cap of what happened.  
所以...这一章是相当重的 M 级内容，实际上我删除了一些内容，因为坦白说，我认为过于露骨可能会导致被删除。说清楚这一点后，这一章包含...嗯，你可以阅读并发现。在某一点上，我会有一个免责声明，这样人们可以选择跳过那部分。只需寻找章节开头和结尾的粗体字。我会简要概述发生了什么。**

---

When Shinji woke up that morning, he had no idea that everything would from today onwards, would start to spiral out of control. If he had known the horror, traumatic event that he would eventually stop, things would have certainly changed. But most likely, in the end, his angels blood would have awoken anyway.  
那天早上，真嗣醒来时，完全不知道从今天开始，一切都将失控。如果他知道最终会阻止的恐怖、创伤性事件，情况肯定会改变。但很可能，最终他的天使之血还是会觉醒。

It was bright that morning, very bright. And yet, by the end of the day, the weather seemed to be foretelling a change in everything.  
那天早晨阳光明媚，非常明亮。然而，到了傍晚时分，天气似乎预示着一切都将发生变化。

Shinji woke early that morning, much earlier than he had nights before, and he could only attribute it to the coma like state that he had been in the past day. But he wasn't the only person up.  
那天早晨，真嗣醒得很早，比前几晚都要早，他只能将其归因于过去一天里他处于的那种昏迷般的状态。但他并不是唯一一个醒着的人。

Turning towards the chair that Asuka had fallen asleep on last night, he immediately registered that she was not sitting in it as it was vacant. Then he recalled the nights events. His last clear memory had been when he saw Asuka clasping her hands together, hiding his own somewhere in that warmth grasp. Had they fallen asleep like that?  
转向昨晚明日香睡着的那把椅子，他立刻注意到她不在那里，椅子是空的。然后他想起了昨晚的事件。他最后的清晰记忆是看到明日香双手紧握，将自己的手藏在那温暖的握持中。他们就这样睡着了吗？

When Shinji entered the kitchen, the last thing he expected was to have breakfast waiting for him on the table. Of course, thats what happened...  
当真嗣走进厨房时，他最没想到的是桌上已经为他准备好了早餐。当然，事情就是这样发生的……

Bacon, eggs, and two pieces of toast, ladled with butter and jam, was neatly set on the table waiting for him, with a napkin and fork and knife placed fittingly on either side of the plate.  
培根、鸡蛋，还有两片涂满黄油和果酱的吐司，整齐地摆放在桌上等待着他，餐盘两侧恰到好处地摆放着餐巾、叉子和刀。

As Shinji continued to stare at the plate of foot on the table, he heard the clearing of someones throat, and only then realize that he was not alone in the kitchen.  
当真嗣继续盯着桌上的那盘食物时，他听到了某人清嗓子的声音，这才意识到厨房里并非只有他一人。

Asuka was standing in front of the stove with a spatula in one hand, and an oven cooling mitten in the other. Whats more, she had dawned the white apron again, and Shinji felt butterflies in his stomach as his eyes roved over the way the apron clung perfectly to her developing curves.  
明日香站在炉子前，一手拿着铲子，另一手戴着隔热手套。更甚的是，她再次穿上了那件白色围裙，真嗣的目光不由自主地在她逐渐显露的曲线间游走，心中涌起一阵悸动。

"Are you gonna stand there all day gawking, or are you actually going to sit down and eat?"  
"你打算在那儿站一整天发呆，还是真的坐下来吃东西？"

"...Did you make all this?" Asked Shinji amazed.  
"...这些都是你做的吗？" 真嗣惊讶地问道。

"No, it was Misato. Sorry if I just ruined your appetite," said Asuka sarcastically.  
"不，是美里做的。抱歉如果我毁了你的胃口，" 明日香讽刺地说道。

"No, I'm just surprised that you would go to such lengths-"  
"不，我只是惊讶你会做到这种程度——"

"You didn't eat anything last night idiot. You should be starving."  
"你昨晚什么都没吃，傻瓜。你应该饿坏了。"

As if an answer to her words, Shinji's stomach gave a loud rumble. It sounded sorta like a dog barking at a fence.  
仿佛是对她话语的回应，真嗣的肚子发出了一阵响亮的咕噜声。听起来有点像狗对着栅栏吠叫。

His face flushed slightly from embarrassed, Shinji gave a word of thanks, before sitting down and digging into his breakfast. Predictably, it was good.  
他的脸因尴尬而微微泛红，真嗣道了声谢，随即坐下开始享用早餐。不出所料，味道很不错。

"So? What are we supposed to be doing today?" Said Shinji between mouthfuls.  
“那么？我们今天应该做些什么呢？”真嗣边吃边问。

Sitting down across from him, with a with a piece of toast in her hand, Asuka said, "_You_ aren't doing anything except staying here. I have to go to school in a minute, but you will be staying home, resting, and doing past homework."  
坐在他对面，手里拿着一片吐司的明日香说道：“你除了待在这里什么也不用做。我一会儿得去上学，但你得留在家里休息，完成之前的作业。”

"Wouldn't it make more sense to go to school instead of skipping another day?"  
"去学校不是比再翘一天更有意义吗？"

"You're staying here, no questions!"  
"你留在这里，不许问问题！"

"Okay, okay, fine. ...Where is Misato, anyway?"  
"好吧，好吧，行。……话说，美里在哪里？"

"No clue. She was gone when I woke up. Probably at Nerv, as usual."  
"不知道。我醒来时她已经不见了。大概又像往常一样去了 Nerv 吧。"

"...I suppose." "……我想也是。"

Tossing the last piece of toast in her mouth, Asuka said, "You do the dishes since I made breakfast."  
阿斯卡将最后一片吐司塞进嘴里，说道：“你洗碗，因为我做了早餐。”

"Hmm, deal." "嗯，成交。"

Several minutes later, Asuka was fully dressed with a bento in her hand that Shinji had hurriedly made out of the remaining ingredients in the fridge. He was wearing the white apron that Asuka had on earlier and could still notice a faint trace of the flowery scent of her hair lingering on the fabric.  
几分钟后，明日香已经穿戴整齐，手里拿着一个便当，这是真嗣用冰箱里剩下的食材匆忙做成的。他穿着明日香之前穿过的白色围裙，还能闻到围裙上残留的淡淡花香，那是她头发的香味。

"I'm most likely stopping downtown after school for somethings."  
"放学后我可能会在市区停一下，买点东西。"

"Do you want to meet somewhere after school gets out?"  
"放学后你想在哪儿见面吗？"

"No, its fine. I can manage by myself."  
"不用，我一个人能行。"

As Asuka turned to leave, Shinji suddenly wanted to say something to her. Like...a reassurance of some kind, that everything was fine. Instead, he brought one arm around and rested it just below her neck line, brushing lightly against her breasts as he did so, while he wrapped his other arm just above her waist.  
当明日香转身离开时，真嗣突然想对她说些什么。像是...某种安慰，告诉她一切都会好起来的。然而，他伸出一只手臂，轻轻搭在她的颈线下方，不经意间触碰到她的胸部，同时另一只手臂环抱在她腰际上方。

Asuka was silent as Shinji showed this strange array of affection. What was she feeling? Comfort? Longing? ...Love? Heaven forbid it couldn't be this last one.  
看着真嗣展现出这一连串奇异的情感，明日香沉默了。她此刻是什么感觉？安慰？渴望？……爱？天哪，千万别是最后这个。

"Shinji," she said somewhat weakly. Oh God why did her knees have to wobble now?  
“真嗣，”她有些无力地说道。哦，天啊，为什么她的膝盖现在要发软？

"Hmmm, Asuka?" “嗯，明日香？”

"Would you mind letting go of me?"  
"你能放开我吗？"

The tender moment which had started abruptly was shattered in the same way with Asuka's cold statement. It wasn't that she hated his silent gesture...she just...didn't know how she was supposed to react to something like that. She had never felt the warmth from another human being such as she felt from Shinji in these brief seconds when their bodies meshed together.  
这个突如其来的温柔瞬间被明日香冷冰冰的话语打破。并不是她讨厌他无声的举动……她只是……不知道该如何回应这样的事情。她从未在如此短暂的几秒钟内，从真嗣的身体接触中感受到来自另一个人的温暖。

"Sorry...I should go..." "对不起……我该走了……"

"Hmm. Cya later then." "嗯，那待会儿见。"

"Yeah...bye Shinji." "是啊...再见，真嗣。"

It sounded as though they'd never see each other again.  
听起来好像他们再也不会见面了。

---

With school out, Asuka found herself walking through some of the more expensive shops and malls of Tokyo-3. She had originally planed to pick up some groceries for Shinji to cook with tonight, but found herself getting side tracked every time she looked into a stores window.  
学校放假了，明日香发现自己漫步在东京-3 一些更为昂贵的商店和购物中心。她原本计划为真嗣今晚做饭买些食材，但每次往商店橱窗里看时，她都会分心。

Now though her thoughts wandered back to Misato's apartment, where Shinji currently was, and what had happened this morning  
然而现在，她的思绪飘回了美里小姐的公寓，真嗣目前所在的地方，以及今早发生的事情。

What would happen if she searched her heart throughly and honestly? What would she realize? And furthermore was it even reasonable to think about that?  
如果她彻底而诚实地审视自己的内心，她会发现什么？她会意识到什么？更重要的是，思考这些是否合理？

She realized that she had been stationary in front of a shopping window for at least a minute, thinking about all these things. Love was...something that she had never considered giving even a brief thought to. Before, she had been happy enough piloting Eva and receiving praise for her high synchronization scores. But why did she pilot now? Why did she pilot in the first place? But...no, that was something that she refused to think about. Her logic at the time had seemed convincing enough, and the benefits certainly outweighed the dangers. But that was more than two years ago that she had decided to follow the path as an Eva pilot. Now what? Had anything changed? Yes, things had...many things. Shinji had entered her life.  
她意识到自己已在一家商店橱窗前驻足至少一分钟，思绪纷飞。爱情，是她从未考虑过要稍加思索的事物。从前，她驾驶 Eva 并因高同步率得分而受到赞誉，便已心满意足。但如今她为何还要驾驶？最初又是为何选择这条路？然而……不，她拒绝深思。当时的逻辑似乎足够有说服力，利益显然大于风险。但那已是两年多前，她决定成为 Eva 驾驶员的时刻。现在呢？是否有所改变？是的，许多事情变了……真嗣走进了她的生活。

Why did everything return to him? What would have happened if she had been transferred somewhere else? Would her life have changed at all? Well, maybe a little. But not to the point where she was having second thoughts now that she was so far down the road. Its not like she could turn back and choose a different route. She was smart, incredibly smart for that matter, and yet...so weak at heart. She was smart enough to see this problem within herself, though never acknowledging it until now. Was it his fault that she felt weak? Well, maybe it was, when her legs got weak when she saw him smiling at her, but certainly not for the reason she was thinking of.  
为什么一切又回到了他身上？如果她被调到别的地方会发生什么？她的生活会有所改变吗？嗯，也许会有一点。但不会到她现在走了这么远的路却开始犹豫不决的地步。她不可能回头选择另一条路。她很聪明，事实上非常聪明，然而...内心却如此脆弱。她足够聪明，能看到自己内心的这个问题，尽管直到现在才承认。她感到软弱是他的错吗？嗯，也许是的，当她看到他向她微笑时，她的腿就软了，但这绝不是她所想的原因。

Eva made her feel fearless, because nothing could get her while she was enclosed in the small suffocating space. Did she honestly enjoy it though? It took her a minute to think of this, but the answer was still a negative. How could anyone honestly enjoy piloting an Evangelion? She had done so because she didn't see another choice. To fill that weakness, she had thrown every other prospect that she had been offered during college, and for what?  
伊娃让她感到无所畏惧，因为在那个狭小窒息的空间里，没有什么能伤害到她。但她真的喜欢这样吗？她花了一分钟思考这个问题，但答案仍然是否定的。有谁能真心喜欢驾驶福音战士呢？她这么做是因为她没有看到其他选择。为了填补那个弱点，她放弃了大学期间被提供的所有其他机会，又是为了什么呢？

She could feel the pieces falling apart even as she thought about them. Shinji had slowly chipped away at the concrete wall that she had formed in her heart. She felt that every time she even talked to him, another piece was chipped away. But it wasn't so bad...she had even made friends through him.  
她能感觉到那些碎片正在崩解，即便是在思考它们的时候。真嗣慢慢地敲碎了她心中筑起的那堵混凝土墙。她觉得每次只要和他交谈，就会有一块碎片被敲落。但这并不糟糕...她甚至通过他交到了朋友。

She had never had any friends when she was younger...her father had made sure of that. She knew that her personality was...difficult to get along with, but that was just who she was. If people didn't like who she was, then they should just get the fuck out of her way. Shinji had accepted that she could be overbearing and possibly a bitch at times, but he still accepted that part of her.  
她小时候从未有过朋友...父亲确保了这一点。她知道自己的性格...难以相处，但那就是她。如果人们不喜欢她，那就应该滚开。真嗣接受了她可能霸道且有时是个泼妇的事实，但他依然接纳了她的这一面。

'How long have I been standing here?' She suddenly wondered, as it had been a very long time since she moved a muscle in either direction. She was still starring at the exact same glass pane.  
'我站在这里多久了？'她突然疑惑起来，因为她已经很久没有动弹了。她仍然盯着那块完全相同的玻璃窗。

'Did I even have a reason to look at this store?' She thought. 'I haven't even gotten any groceries and-,' she looked up at the sky, '-it looks like it might rain soon. Certainly don't want to be caught in a down poor with these clothes.'  
“我为什么要看这家店呢？”她心想，“我连杂货都没买，而且——”她抬头望向天空，“——看起来好像快下雨了。当然不想穿着这些衣服被大雨淋湿。”

Asuka refrained from using her school uniform whenever possible, and especially while out in public. She was wearing a tight, red, sleeveless shirt, and a low cut pair of blue jeans that came up to her knees. To top it all off she had brought a pair of red sunglasses that were now resting on her head. It seemed that they would serve no purpose.  
尽可能避免穿校服的明日香，尤其是在公共场合。她穿着一件紧身的红色无袖上衣，以及一条低腰的蓝色牛仔短裤。最后，她还戴了一副红色的太阳镜，现在正架在她的头上。看来它们派不上用场了。

"I should hurry," she mumbled into the crowd of people.  
“我得快点，”她对着人群喃喃自语。

How long it had been since she mumbled that she should hurry? She had no idea. All she knew was that she had entered the grocery store while the rain had not started, and when she left, it was a full down pour  
她咕哝着应该快点，已经过去多久了？她毫无头绪。她只知道，她进杂货店时雨还没开始下，而当她离开时，已经是倾盆大雨。

Standing just outside the grocery store where there was a plastic overhang, she had two large plastic bags of an assortment of things to cook with, and Asuka wondered if she shouldn't just get a cab.  
站在杂货店外的塑料遮檐下，她手里提着两大袋各式各样的烹饪食材，明日香心想，也许她应该叫辆出租车。

Looking into her purse, she saw that she had a little over ten dollars.  
她翻了翻钱包，发现里面还有十美元多一点。

'That should be enough,' she thought suddenly.  
"'这样应该够了，'她突然想到。

Walking calmly out into the down pore, she raised a hand in the air to wave for a taxi cab, when all the sudden, she felt a hand press roughly against her mouth, and another hand grab a hold of the back of her neck. Feeling strong fingers pressing directly against the back of her neck, she tried to force herself to scream, or making some sort of fit, but felt that her body was incapable of moving.  
"她平静地走出雨中，举起手在空中挥舞，想要叫一辆出租车，就在这时，她感到一只手粗鲁地捂住了她的嘴，另一只手抓住了她的后颈。感觉到强有力的手指直接按在她的后颈上，她试图强迫自己尖叫或做出某种挣扎，但感觉自己的身体动弹不得。

Blackness engulfed her as she struggled to stay conscious and the last visible object that she saw, was of a mother running from the rain with a baby cradled in her arms across the street.  
"黑暗吞噬了她，她挣扎着保持清醒，最后看到的景象是一位母亲抱着婴儿，横穿马路，从雨中奔跑。

'I have to scream,' she thought.  
"'我必须尖叫，'她心想。

Just as she was able to force her mouth open, she heard the swish of something heavy falling and heard no more.  
"就在她勉强张开嘴的那一刻，她听到了重物坠落的呼啸声，随后便再无声息。

The entire thing happened without the knowledge of anybody. The only person that could have witnessed this was the mother with her child, but she was too focused on her feet, afraid that she might trip or slide.  
"这一切发生得悄无声息，无人知晓。唯一可能目睹这一幕的是一位带着孩子的母亲，但她正全神贯注于自己的脚步，生怕会绊倒或滑倒。

People walking by, would glance at the forgotten groceries tossed to the side and think what a waste it was to leave perfectly good food in the rain. Eventually, a homeless person would come by later and claim both bags of food.  
路过的人们会瞥一眼被遗忘在路边的杂货，心想把这么好的食物留在雨中真是浪费。最终，一个无家可归的人稍后会过来，拿走这两袋食物。

Asuka's existence had been erased.  
明日香的存在已被抹去。

---

Anxious? Nervous? That summed up what Shinji was feeling right now.  
焦虑？紧张？这正是真嗣此刻的心情。

Okay so it was raining...of course she wouldn't want to get wet so she was probably waiting till it stopped. But it didn't look like there was an end in sight.  
好吧，外面在下雨...她当然不想淋湿，所以可能是在等雨停。但看起来这场雨似乎没有要停的意思。

How many hours had it been? Only one? It sure seemed like more.  
已经过去多少小时了？才一个小时吗？感觉上好像更久。

Asuka had gotten out of school around two forty-five, making the time three forty-five currently.  
明日香大约两点半放学，现在的时间是三点半。

'Calm down,' Shinji told himself as he paced back and forth in the living room. 'Maybe she took a taxi home and the traffic is really bad. It is raining outside. But would she have enough money?' And the question that had been screaming in his face for the past few minutes reared its head. Why the fuck didn't he go with her!  
'冷静点，' 真嗣在客厅里来回踱步时对自己说。'也许她打车回家了，交通真的很糟糕。外面还在下雨。但她有足够的钱吗？' 而那个在过去几分钟里一直在他面前尖叫的问题再次浮现。他妈的为什么他没有和她一起去！

He could understand the school, but why shouldn't they have met downtown. It made no sense. Maybe she wanted to get him a gift and surprise him with it. No, thats totally unlike her. But then, she has been steadily changing. She's become warmer towards him since they first met, and the name calling and abusing has steadily decreased.  
他可以理解学校的规定，但为什么他们不应该在市中心见面。这毫无道理。也许她想给他买个礼物，给他一个惊喜。不，这完全不像她。但话说回来，她一直在逐渐改变。自从他们第一次见面以来，她对他变得温暖多了，那些骂人的话和辱骂也逐渐减少了。

Again, Shinji found himself wanting to rip open the door and charge into the pouring rain, but held himself back, saying that he was overreacting. Everything was fine, nothing had happened...  
真嗣又一次发现自己想要猛地打开门，冲进倾盆大雨中，但他克制住了自己，认为自己在小题大做。一切都很好，什么都没发生...

No, it did. It was unpleasant, but he knew that something had happened. What the fuck was it?  
不，确实发生了。虽然不愉快，但他知道有什么事情发生了。到底他妈的是什么？

If he had been looking in a mirror or any piece of glass he would have seen his eyes flash scarlet for a moment at his sudden anger.  
如果他当时照镜子或任何一块玻璃，他会看到自己的眼睛因突如其来的愤怒而短暂闪现猩红色。

(A/N: **Okay...this next part contains, heavy graphic violence, heavy blood and gore, and attempted rape. If you don't want to read this part, skip to the next bold lettering)**  
（作者注：接下来这部分包含重度暴力、大量血腥和试图强奸的情节。如果你不想阅读这部分，请跳至下一粗体字部分）

Pain suddenly seared through his temples and a rush of visions hit him. Asuka staring at a glass pane where a mannequin was standing behind the glass. Asuka paying for groceries at the counter and then picking up the plastic bags. Asuka standing on the sidewalk with rain droplets peppering her beautiful face as she waved for a taxi. The sudden fear in Asuka's eyes as she felt a man cover her mouth with a gloved hand. The sudden realization that her life was in danger. Shinji watched as Asuka opened her mouth weakly, before the stranger in black brought his hand down with a sickening chop into the back of Asuka's neck, making her entire body go limp.  
剧痛突然刺穿他的太阳穴，一连串的幻象向他袭来。明日香凝视着玻璃窗后站立的人体模特。明日香在收银台付款，然后拿起塑料袋。明日香站在人行道上，雨滴打在她美丽的脸上，她挥手叫出租车。明日香感到一个男人用戴着手套的手捂住她的嘴时，眼中突然流露出的恐惧。她突然意识到自己的生命处于危险之中。真嗣看着明日香虚弱地张开嘴，随后那个黑衣陌生人用手刀狠狠劈在明日香的后颈，使她整个人瘫软下来。

Shinji screamed as another rush of visions hit him, these less distinct and foggy. Asuka telling the man to go fuck himself. The mans response as he slapped her and yelled something back. Her eyes as tears streamed down her face, her arms forcefully pinned against a wall and tied together with a thick cord. The man howling in agony as he looked at the large teeth marks that had been drilled into his forefinger.  
真嗣再次尖叫，又一波幻象冲击着他，这些幻象不那么清晰，模糊不清。明日香告诉那个男人去他妈的。男人回应着扇了她一巴掌并大喊回去。她的眼泪顺着脸颊流下，双臂被强行按在墙上，用一根粗绳绑在一起。男人看着自己食指上被咬出的深深齿痕，痛苦地嚎叫。

Here the images became even more foggy and Shinji felt that someone had put a blindfold over his eyes. Asuka's soulless eyes as the man violated her body. The rapists hands as they slithered around Asuka's developing body, pausing here and there for further examination. A loud cry escaping her lips as a knife dug into the a spot just above her eyebrows. Shinji watched as blood trickled down and into her eyes, mixing with the tears. And then a voice, a horrible voice, the voice of the rapists came clear and into Shinji's head  
这里的影像变得更加模糊，真嗣感觉仿佛有人在他眼前蒙上了一块眼罩。明日香那空洞的眼神，当那个男人侵犯她的身体时。强奸犯的手在她发育中的身体上游走，时而停顿，进行更深入的审视。一声尖叫从她的唇间逃逸，一把刀刺入了她眉心上方的一点。真嗣看着鲜血缓缓流下，混入她的泪水中。接着是一个声音，一个可怕的声音，强奸犯的声音清晰地传入真嗣的脑海

"I'll fuck ya till ya bleedin from more den just one hole ya cunt!"  
“我要干到你从不止一个洞里流血，你这个婊子！”

Everything vaporized and came back as clear as if he was standing right next to Asuka's corpse. A crowd of people stood around the body, and Shinji could see his fellow classmates mixed in with the adults. Her body had been dumped in a gutter, to rot with the weeds and sewage. Her shirt had been torn open with a viscous swipe of a switchblade, slicing into the soft tissue of her breasts. Her face was heavily bruised and it looked as though her jaw had been dislocated sometime during the rape. The large gash above her eyebrow was already starting to attract a healthy swarm of flies. But it was the mixture of semen and blood that drew Shinji's eyes. He had destroyed her, he had not just raped and killed her, he had destroyed her.  
一切化为乌有，又清晰地重现，仿佛他就站在明日香的尸体旁。一群人围着尸体，其中混杂着他的同学和成年人。她的尸体被丢弃在排水沟里，与杂草和污水一同腐烂。她的衬衫被锋利的弹簧刀猛地划开，割入了她柔软的胸部组织。她的脸严重瘀伤，看起来她的下巴在强奸过程中被脱臼了。她眉骨上的大伤口已经开始吸引一群健康的苍蝇。但吸引真嗣目光的是混合在血液中的精液。他毁了她，不仅仅是强奸并杀害了她，他彻底摧毁了她。

Reality returned and Shinji sake onto all fours, gasping for breath. Everything happened in an instant. Shinji couldn't handle it and vomited bile and blood up on the carpet in the living room.  
现实回归，真嗣四肢着地，喘息不已。一切发生在一瞬间。真嗣无法承受，将胆汁和血吐在了客厅的地毯上。

Shivering uncontrollably his first thoughts were, 'Where are we?'  
他 uncontrollably 地颤抖着，第一个念头是：‘我们在哪儿？’

Before he gave his mind a chance to answer he rushed out the door. He would let himself think as he ran.  
在他有机会思考之前，他冲出了门。他会在奔跑中让自己思考。

He had a general idea of where Asuka liked to shop and even thought he recognized the store that she had spent an eternity staring at. 'Where are we,' coursed through his mind followed by, 'how far have we gone?' He had learned, but it had taken sometime. His visions detected what happened, what might happen, and what could happen. The thing is...it isn't accurate. Every human is different; they react differently to different situations. Any one of those things could happen, or they could not. It all depended on reactions and counter reactions. Humans are able to create there own futures, that is what makes them such a unique race. Shinji can not predict over a billion common situations because it is simply beyond a humans grasp.  
他对绫波喜欢购物的地方有个大致的了解，甚至认为他认出了她曾凝视许久的那个店铺。'我们在哪儿'，他的脑海中闪过这个问题，紧接着是'我们走了多远？'他学到了一些，但这需要时间。他的视觉能察觉到发生了什么，可能发生什么，以及可能发生什么。问题是...这并不准确。每个人都是不同的；他们对不同的情况有不同的反应。这些事情中的任何一件都可能发生，也可能不发生。一切都取决于反应和反反应。人类能够创造自己的未来，这就是他们如此独特的种族的原因。真嗣无法预测数十亿种常见情况，因为这超出了人类的理解范围。

He still had a fucking good idea where he was headed though.  
尽管如此，他还是对要去的地方有个相当不错的想法。

---

As Shinji bolted down streets in the pouring rain, Asuka opened her eyes in a dank, musky, boarded up shack roughly one kilometer from where she had been standing what felt like minutes before.  
当真嗣在倾盆大雨中疾驰过街道时，明日香在一间潮湿、霉臭、用木板封住的破旧小屋中睁开了眼睛，这间小屋距离她几分钟前站立的地方大约一公里。

Looking around she didn't immediately see any signs of life until she heard a she heard a raspy chuckle from somewhere straight ahead of her. It was dark though that she had troubles distinguishing it.  
她环顾四周，起初并未发现任何生命迹象，直到她听到前方某处传来一阵沙哑的轻笑。虽然光线昏暗，但她难以辨认出具体位置。

"Awake are ya? Good...cuz I'ma throbbin like a mother fucker."  
“醒了是吧？很好...因为我现在疼得像要命一样。”

Letting out a high pitched laugh, Asuka saw the rapists face come into clearer view. He had light brown hair that was coated in grime and dirt, and when he smiled his teeth were as black as mold.  
发出一声尖锐的笑声，明日香看清了强奸犯的脸。他有着沾满污垢和泥土的浅棕色头发，当他微笑时，牙齿黑得像霉菌一样。

"Say somethin will ya. I like it when they get screamin, turns me on like a-"  
“说点什么吧，我喜欢她们尖叫，那让我兴奋得像——”

Asuka spit a large clump of mucus and spittle onto the bridge of his noes.  
明日香朝他的鼻梁吐了一大口痰和唾沫。

"Fuck off why don't you!"  
"滚开，你这混蛋！"

Grinning in a maniacal way he wiped the sludge of his noes and said, "No thank ya. My cock is sick of mister righty. It wants something to please it. An you look like ya could do that just fine."  
他疯狂地笑着，擦去鼻子上的污泥，说道：“不用了，谢谢。我的老二已经厌倦了右手先生。它想要点能取悦它的东西。而你看起来正合适。”

Asuka spit at him again and said, "Try anything and I swear I'll cut your fucking cock off."  
明日香再次向他吐口水，并说：“敢动一下，我发誓我会把你那该死的鸡巴割下来。”

This statement seemed to enrage him greatly and he struck her hard across the face, bouncing her head off the wooden wall behind her. Asuka went down with a groan and thought she could feel blood trickling from where she had hit her head.  
这句话似乎让他极为愤怒，他重重地打了她一巴掌，使她的头撞在了身后的木墙上。明日香呻吟着倒下，感觉有血从她撞到的地方流出来。

"Bitch! I'll give ya something to have fun with soon."  
“婊子！我很快就会让你尝到苦头。”

Grabbing Asuka by her strawberry hair, he drug her across the musty, dirt floor before throwing her into a corner. As Asuka tried to stand up she felt a claw like hand grasp her throat; he was constricting her wind pipe. His breath was loud and raspy and it smelled like booze. But Asuka had enough experience with drunks to know that this guy was not drunk and that he knew exactly what he was doing. 'Probably done this many times,' she thought savagely.  
他抓住明日香的草莓色头发，将她拖过满是霉味和尘土的地面，然后把她扔进一个角落。明日香试图站起来时，感到一只爪子般的手抓住了她的喉咙；他在压迫她的气管。他的呼吸声大而刺耳，带着一股酒气。但明日香对醉汉有足够的经验，知道这家伙并没有喝醉，他完全清楚自己在做什么。‘可能已经做过很多次了，’她愤怒地想。

She may have been putting up a brave front, but she didn't know how long she'd be able to keep doing that. She was scared, more scared that she had ever been in her life. And that fear ate away at her.  
她或许一直在强撑着勇敢的外表，但她不知道自己还能坚持多久。她害怕，比以往任何时候都要害怕。这种恐惧在侵蚀着她。

"Listen slut," he said suddenly, grabbing a handful of Asuka's hair and jerking her head backwards. "I can kill you and then fuck you or we can have it be the other way around. The flesh is still warm so either way is fine by me."  
“听着，婊子，”他突然说道，抓住明日香的一把头发，猛地将她的头向后拽。“我可以杀了你再干你，或者反过来。反正肉体还是温的，对我来说都无所谓。”

'Is this really a human?' Wondered Asuka. 'This vile creature in front of me that doesn't care as long as he fulfills his desires is really a human?'  
“这真的是人吗？”明日香心想。“这个在我面前只顾满足自己欲望、毫不在乎的卑劣生物，真的是人吗？”

"So whats it gonna be cunt? We fuckin or stabbin?"  
"那你想怎么样，婊子？我们是要干还是捅？"

Asuka released her held breath as she heard a click and saw the blade of a switchblade go flying open.  
听到咔嚓一声，看到弹簧刀的刀刃飞快弹开，明日香松开了憋着的气。

Caressing it gently as though it was a child, the rapist replied, "I've gutted a few many whores with this. Took some prostitutes tities for a keep safe. Didn't want her pussy, that thing was sa-gg-y. How bout I shove this up those pants of your's and find out where it lands?"  
他轻轻抚摸着刀，仿佛在抚慰一个孩子，强奸犯回答道：“我用这把刀捅过不少妓女。还割下过几个妓女的奶子留作纪念。她的那玩意儿太松垮了，我可不感兴趣。不如我把这刀插进你的裤子里，看看会落到哪儿？”

Asuka held her breath, unable to make a sound. Had it really come to this, was she going to be desecrated. She had always thought she would die during an angel attack. Certainly that would have been a lot more dignifying then this.  
明日香屏住呼吸，发不出一点声音。难道真的到了这一步，她将要被玷污吗？她一直以为自己会在与使徒的战斗中死去。那样肯定比现在更有尊严。

"Well, since you don't have much opinion on this I think I'll just see what kind of tits you got. Gotta be doing pretty good with that bulge you got. Younger is always better...I sure hope to God you're a virgin."  
“好吧，既然你对这个没什么意见，那我就看看你的胸部怎么样。有你那鼓起的家伙，肯定不错。年轻总是好的...我真希望你是处女。”

With deadly accuracy, the rapist swiped the switchblade in a downward arc, ripping apart the tight fabric of Asuka's shirt and slicing the bra that she wore under it. Asuka shivered uncontrollably as she felt the cold metal brush against her breasts.  
那强奸犯以致命的准确度挥动弹簧刀，向下划出一道弧线，撕裂了明日香紧身的衬衫和她穿着的胸罩。明日香不由自主地颤抖着，感觉到冰冷的金属触碰到了她的胸部。

"Oh not bad...not to large, not to small, gonna be a good size when you get older of course. Then again I guess you have about five minutes left of your life so better start hoping for large tits. I might give you an extra five minutes if you can grow those."  
"哦，不错...不大不小，等你长大后肯定会很合适。不过话说回来，你大概只剩下五分钟可活了，最好开始祈祷能长出大胸来。如果你能长出来，我或许会多给你五分钟。"

Throwing his head backwards he laughed his high pitched laugh again. Acting on his momentary distraction, Asuka dove to her left, attempting to cover up her exposed breasts in the process. Reacting quicker than she thought he would, he saw the movement quickly and brought his knife downward, grazing her elbow as the blade passed.  
他猛地将头向后仰，再次发出那尖锐的笑声。趁着他分神的瞬间，明日香向左猛扑过去，试图遮住自己暴露的胸部。他的反应比她预想的要快，迅速察觉到她的动作，挥刀向下劈去，刀刃擦过她的肘部。

"Bitch! Get the fuck back here!"  
"婊子！滚回来！"

Swinging the blade wildly, Asuka managed to dodge most of the attacks but without looking where she was going ended up getting cornered against a wall.  
挥舞着刀刃狂乱地躲避，明日香勉强躲过了大部分攻击，但由于没有注意方向，最终被逼到了墙角。

Breathing heavily, the rapist said, "Good run cunt. Get ready to loose some blood though."  
喘着粗气，强奸犯说道：“跑得不错，婊子。准备好流点血吧。”

Striking Asuka hard, he split her lip open against one of her teeth, making a slow trickle of blood flow from her mouth.  
重重地击打明日香，他使她的嘴唇裂开，撞在了一颗牙齿上，鲜血缓缓从她的嘴角流出。

"Looks better that way...maybe you'll learn to be more obedient."  
"这样看起来好多了...也许你会学会更听话。"

Moving at a surprising speed, he slammed his arm into her throat, pressing his entire body weight against his throat as he started to contemplate his work.  
他以惊人的速度移动，猛地将手臂撞向她的喉咙，用全身的重量压在她的喉咙上，同时开始思考他的工作。

"Where should I start? Or would you rather me just skip right to the main-"  
"我该从哪里开始呢？还是你更希望我直接跳到主要的...-"

Asuka bit down hard on the arm that her pinned against the wall. The rapist screamed in fury and pain as her teeth sank deep into his skin  
明日香狠狠地咬住将她按在墙上的那只手臂。强奸犯因剧痛和愤怒尖叫起来，她的牙齿深深陷入他的皮肤。

"YOU BITCH! YOU FUCKING BITCH!"  
“你这个婊子！你这个该死的婊子！”

Wrenching his arm free he looked at her work with shock on his face. Never before had he had so much trouble with a rape victim. He subdued them easily and then banged them without much protest and then dumped there bodies with the other sewage.  
他用力挣脱手臂，脸上露出震惊的表情。他从未遇到过如此难缠的强奸受害者。通常他轻易就能制服她们，然后几乎没有反抗地与她们发生关系，最后将她们的尸体和其他垃圾一起丢弃。

His arm was a large bloody mess as Asuka's teeth marks had torn through many layers of skin before the blood underneath  
他的手臂被撕扯得血肉模糊，阿斯卡的牙印穿透了多层皮肤，鲜血随之涌出。

Glaring at Asuka with nothing but hate now, he had nothing else in his mind now except her death. He would gouge out her eyes balls and feed them to the alligators at the zoo. Burn the hair of her scalp and pull out her teeth. Nobody made a fool out of him.  
他现在满眼都是对阿斯卡的仇恨，心中除了她的死别无他念。他要挖出她的眼珠喂给动物园的鳄鱼，烧掉她的头皮毛发，拔掉她的牙齿。没人能让他成为笑柄。

"Thats it bitch! I'll fuck you till you're bleedin from more then just one hole you cunt!"  
“就这样，婊子！我要操到你不止一个洞流血，你这贱货！”

Swinging the switchblade in a large arc above his head, he brought it down with a sickening whoosh. Asuka felt like she was watching her death in slow motion. 'Ah...I never even got to tell Shinji what I-'  
他挥动着弹簧刀，在头顶划出一道大弧，猛地向下劈来，伴随着令人作呕的呼啸声。明日香感觉自己像是在慢镜头中目睹死亡的降临。'啊...我甚至都没来得及告诉真嗣我-'

Asuka closed her eyes and waited for the odd feeling of her life leaving her body. Her organs and blood moving freely from her body. At least she wouldn't have to worry about being raped anymore if she was dead. She started crying silently...but more than tears had landed on her face. Tears were warm and had a certain distinct feel to them, this liquid was warm, but felt more dense. At first she thought that he had suddenly changed his mind and ejaculated on her. Instead she heard a high pitched wail combined with curse words  
明日香闭上眼睛，等待着生命从身体中流逝的奇异感觉。她的器官和血液自由地从体内流出。至少如果她死了，就不用再担心被强奸了。她开始默默地哭泣...但落在她脸上的不仅仅是泪水。泪水是温暖的，有着独特的触感，而这液体虽然也温暖，却感觉更加浓稠。起初她以为他突然改变了主意，射在了她身上。然而，她却听到了一声尖锐的哀嚎，夹杂着咒骂声。

"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO MY ARM? WHERE THE FUCK DID IT GO?"  
“这他妈是什么？我的手臂怎么了？它他妈去哪儿了？”

Against her minds protests she opened her eyes slowly.  
尽管内心极力反对，她还是缓缓睁开了眼睛。

The right arm of the rapist had been sliced clean, directly at the elbow. Asuka was able to see the joint of the elbow swing freely without any muscle to hold it in place. Yellow bone marrow coated the inside of the joint and a white puss like substance was leaking out of the stub of an arm.  
强奸犯的右臂从肘部被干净利落地切断。明日香能看到肘关节在没有肌肉支撑的情况下自由摆动。关节内部覆盖着黄色的骨髓，断臂处流出一种类似脓液的白色物质。

The arm had meanwhile flown several feet away from where its original owner stood. The switchblade was still firmly grasped in the hand.  
那只手臂此时已经飞离了原主站立的地方好几英尺。手中的弹簧刀依然紧紧握着。

As Asuka realized what had just happened, she put a hand to her cheek and drew it back to revealing spotted patches of blood. She had been sprayed by the severing of the arm.  
当明日香意识到刚刚发生了什么时，她用手抚摸脸颊，收回时露出了斑斑血迹。她被断臂喷溅出的血液沾染了。

But then...who just- 但那么...刚才是谁——

A large square had been sliced directly into the side of the building, revealing the grayness of the rain outside. Standing just outside that hole was Ikari Shinji. But he was different, his eyes...  
大楼一侧被直接切出了一个巨大的方形缺口，露出了外面灰蒙蒙的雨景。站在那个洞口外的正是碇真嗣。但他变得不同了，他的眼神……

Shinji stepped into the blown out piece of what was considered a house. He looked around calmly, his eyes first settling on Asuka, crouched in the corner with her breasts exposed for everybody to see., and then to the rapist who was curled on the floor, cradling his bloody stump of an arm.  
真嗣踏入了那片被炸毁的废墟，这里曾被视为一所房子。他平静地环顾四周，目光首先落在角落里蹲着的明日香身上，她的胸部暴露无遗；随后转向蜷缩在地上、抱着血淋淋断臂的强奸犯。

Shinji grinned and thought. 'I want to rip his body in half, break his neck, and shred his internal organs.'  
真嗣咧嘴一笑，心中暗想：'我想把他撕成两半，扭断他的脖子，撕碎他的内脏。'

"YOU BASTARD! WHAT DID YOU DO?"  
“你这个混蛋！你做了什么？”

"...What did I do? What did you do?"  
"...我做了什么？你又做了什么？"

Screaming in a mad rage, the rapist charged forward, only to be repelled backwards by an invisible wall.  
强奸犯在疯狂的愤怒中尖叫着冲上前，却被一道无形的墙反弹了回去。

"WHAT WAS-" "这是什么-"

Shinji appeared in front of him with his fist cocked backwards. Orange light flashed momentarily as Shinji thrust his fist forward, except his fist never made contact with the flesh. A small spherical orb suddenly appeared in front of the rapists stomach, before shooting straight through it.  
真嗣突然出现在他面前，拳头向后蓄力。橙光一闪而过，真嗣猛地向前挥拳，然而拳头并未触及肉体。一个微小的球状能量体突然出现在强奸犯的腹部前方，随即直穿而过。

Blood spewed forth from his mouth and it looked like a fountain had just been erected where his stomach once was. A hole, about the size of a fifty cent piece was able to be seen on either of the body. Stomach bile leaked out and fell onto the dirt flooring, spraying it a sickly yellow color. Asuka thought she saw what remained of a half digested sandwich in the mess.  
鲜血从他口中喷涌而出，仿佛在他原本的腹部位置竖起了一座喷泉。身体两侧各有一个约五十元硬币大小的洞。胃液渗出，滴落在泥土地面上，溅成病态的黄色。明日香觉得她看到了那堆混乱中残留的半个未消化的三明治。

Gasping for breath, the rapist took two steps backwards before sinking to his feet, attempting to hold his internal organs inside of him with his other hand. 'What was happening here,' he wondered? Nothing like this had ever happened. He always got away with what he did, ever since he was young. But this person...no, this kid. He was a demon, a monster, and those blood red eyes; those sightless blood red eyes that seemed to be dissecting him as he looked into them. He had to get away. If he didn't he'd surely-  
强奸犯喘着粗气，后退两步后瘫倒在地，试图用另一只手捂住体内的器官。'这里发生了什么？'他疑惑着。这种事从未发生过。自幼以来，他总能逍遥法外。但这个人...不，这个孩子。他是恶魔，是怪物，那双血红的眼睛；那双看似无神却仿佛在剖析他的血红眼睛。他必须逃走。如果他不逃，他肯定会——

Blood spewed forth from his mouth again and dripped down the front of his shirt, making the surface turn shiny with blood. Looking up weakly, he started uttering some feeble words of mercy when Shinji struck again.  
鲜血再次从他口中喷涌而出，沿着衬衫前襟滴落，使其表面泛着血光。他虚弱地抬头，开始低声祈求怜悯，然而真嗣再次出手。

Shinji's fist cascaded directly into the side of his head with two times the force he had used against Asuka's father. The rapists jaw all but disintegrated. The left side of his bottom jaw completely snapped in two, stabbing the bone downward and slicing apart the soft tissue of his throat. A gurgling noise issued in his throat as blood started to seep into his lungs. The top jaw slammed down into his bottom lip, ripping apart every bit of flesh so that if he smiled you would be able to see the roots of his teeth. Blood poured forth from his nose as a large chunk of cartilage dislodged from his nose and wedged itself between his eyes.  
真嗣的拳头如暴雨般直击他的头部侧面，力道是之前对付明日香父亲的两倍。强奸犯的下颚几乎被摧毁。左侧下颚完全断裂成两截，骨刺向下刺穿，割裂了喉咙的软组织。喉咙中发出咕噜声，血液开始渗入肺部。上颚猛地撞击下唇，撕裂了所有肉体，以至于如果他微笑，你将能看到牙齿的根部。鲜血从鼻孔涌出，一大块软骨从鼻中脱落，卡在双眼之间。

The blow had completely knocked him backwards off his feet, and he had gone sailing into the wood wall behind, where he sunk slowly down to the floor, leaving a large smear of blood on the wooden surface. Years later, this shack would be painted a sickly red to cover up all the blood that was spilled today.  
这一击彻底将他击飞，他向后飞去，撞上了身后的木墙，缓缓滑落到地板上，留下一大片血迹在木质表面上。多年以后，这间小屋将被涂成病态的红色，以掩盖今天所洒下的所有鲜血。

Shinji looked down at his fist after the swift punch. Several of his fingers were bent in odd direction, seemingly to be broken. His knuckles were a bloody mess, revealing the white of the bone underneath. Even so, he felt no pain. Only the pain that Asuka had felt.  
真嗣低头看着自己刚刚迅速挥出的拳头。几根手指弯曲得异常，似乎是断了。他的指节血肉模糊，露出了下面的白骨。即便如此，他并未感到疼痛。只有明日香曾感受到的痛楚。

Take several slow steps forward he was somewhat surprised to see that the rapist had somehow managed to regain his feet. 'There must be a large amount of adrenaline pumping through is body right now,' Shinji thought.  
他缓缓向前走了几步，有些惊讶地发现那个强奸犯不知怎么又站了起来。'此刻他体内一定涌动着大量肾上腺素，'真嗣心想。

As the rapist took a slow step forward, Shinji made a quick movement with his right hand and the rapists fell flat on his face as his left foot was taken off directly below the ankle. He was in the middle of walking forward again when his foot had been sliced off. The two bones ground together with the sound of nails on a chalk board. His upper leg slid off to the side, leaving his foot upright where it had still been connected. Yellow marrow bubbled to the surface of the leg and started flowing onto the ground. It almost looked like he had pissed himself, in which Shinji reminded himself that he had, moments before.  
当强奸犯缓慢地向前迈步时，真嗣迅速用右手一挥，对方便脸朝下重重摔倒，因为他的左脚踝直接被切断。他正要再次向前走时，脚被切断了，两根骨头摩擦发出令人毛骨悚然的声音。他的大腿上半部分滑向一边，留下那只脚依然直立在原本连接的地方。黄色的骨髓涌出，开始流到地面上。看起来几乎像是他尿了裤子，真嗣提醒自己，就在不久前，他的确尿了。

With what remained of his face was planted firmly in the dirt his teeth were not only coated with grime but also dirt now. Shinji looked down at the bloody mess of what was once a human minutes ago. Smiling slightly, he knew he didn't have much time before he certainly die from blood loss.  
他的脸深深埋在泥土中，牙齿不仅沾满了污垢，还混杂着泥土。真嗣低头看着几分钟前还是人类的血肉模糊的残骸，微微一笑，他知道自己失血过多，命不久矣。

Walking over to him, he was immensely glad that he was still conscious. Shinji wanted to see the fear in his eyes as he slowly crushed him to death.  
他走过去，非常庆幸对方还清醒着。真嗣想要看到他眼中的恐惧，慢慢地将他碾压至死。

In what was very well his last feeble attempt at retaliation, the rapist's other hand twitched slightly and Shinji all but glanced at it before the hand was taken off at the wrist. Bone stuck out of this new stub of an arm and Shinji grinned at his work. Oh this felt good!  
这很可能是他最后一次无力的反抗，强奸犯的另一只手微微抽搐，真嗣几乎没看一眼，那只手就被从手腕处切断。骨头从新断臂的残端突出，真嗣对自己的杰作咧嘴一笑。哦，这种感觉真好！

Looking down at the rapist, no emotion was in his eyes. Nothing could save this human, and he could understand why the angels wished to destroy the earth. It was polluted by humans, and here was an example of such pollution.  
俯视着那个强奸犯，他的眼中没有一丝情感。这个人类已无可救药，他也能理解为何天使们希望毁灭地球。它被人类污染了，而眼前就是这种污染的例证。

Shinji stepped on the rapists chest and pressed down with such force that he heard several ribs snap. Very likely the splinters had been lodged in some major organ...if he was lucky.  
真嗣踩在强奸犯的胸口上，施加的力量之大，以至于他听到了几根肋骨断裂的声音。很可能骨片已经刺入了某个重要器官...如果他幸运的话。

As he continued applying more pressure he felt himself sinking further into the ground as the rapists body was slowly being ground into a bloody husk of flesh. It was time to finish it.  
随着他继续施加压力，他感觉自己正逐渐陷入地面，强奸犯的身体慢慢被碾成了一滩血肉模糊的残骸。是时候结束了。

Shinji slammed an AT-field on top of the rapist covering every portion of his remaining body except for the head. From the shoulders down he was being covered by an AT-field, all that was free was the head. Breathing had become difficult as his lungs had almost been filled to the top with blood, but the air that he was able to receive and send to his brain was now being prevented by the AT-field. His neck was heavily being compressed and no amount of oxygen could pass through his Trachea.  
真嗣在强奸犯的身上施加了一个 AT 力场，覆盖了他身体的每一部分，除了头部。从肩膀以下都被 AT 力场覆盖，只有头部是自由的。呼吸变得困难，因为他的肺几乎被血液填满，但现在 AT 力场阻止了他接收和向大脑输送的空气。他的脖子被严重压缩，没有任何氧气能通过他的气管。

His body was being forced into the hard ground, but his body was no longer sinking into the ground. Blood pressure started to build up as it all started to travel to the brain. His heart ceased to function properly. Blood poured from his ears and nostrils and his veins soon became backed up with blood.  
他的身体被强行压入坚硬的地面，但他的身体不再下沉。血压开始上升，所有的血液都开始流向大脑。他的心脏停止了正常工作。血液从他的耳朵和鼻孔中涌出，血管很快就被血液堵塞。

With a popping sound like that of a toilet being unplugged, his right eye popped out of its socket and hung limply next to the broken nose, freed from the brain. Blood trickled forth from the bloody socket and dribbled down into his open mouth.  
随着一声像马桶被拔掉塞子的爆裂声，他的右眼从眼窝中弹出，无力地挂在断裂的鼻梁旁，脱离了大脑。血液从血淋淋的眼窝中流出，滴入他张开的嘴里。

Bulges started to form in his neck as the blood pressure was building. It was like a champagne bottle. You shook it, and all the pressure from the carbonate sent the cork flying.  
他的脖子上开始鼓起肿块，血压正在升高。就像一瓶香槟。你摇晃它，所有碳酸的压力让瓶塞飞了出去。

It happened in less than an instance.  
这一切发生在一瞬间。

Just like the champagne bottle, the blood pressure in the neck built up to a point where the veins could no longer contain it. It exploded.  
就像那瓶香槟一样，脖子里的血压升至极限，血管再也承受不住。它爆发了。

Flesh was rendered, cerebral fluid was spewed across the floor, bits of bones and flesh were sent flying in all directions as the rapists head dislodged from the rest of his body. The remaining eye exploded, showering Shinji's face with clear liquid. Brain matter was clumped in a spot against the wall with bits of the spinal cord still attached. What remained of his jaw was sent skidding across the slick floor with pieces of teeth still attached.  
血肉横飞，脑浆四溅，碎骨与肉块四处飞散，施暴者的头颅与身体分离。剩下的那只眼球爆裂，清澈的液体溅了真嗣一脸。脑组织粘在墙上一处，还连着些许脊髓。残留的下颚在光滑的地板上滑行，带着几颗牙齿碎片。

(A/N: **So here is where it ends. Basically Shinji had a vision of the possibility that Asuka could get raped and reacted on that. The rapist was pretty much dismembered with Shinji using an AT-field.**  
（作者注：故事至此结束。基本上，真嗣预见到了明日香可能被强暴的可能性并因此做出了反应。施暴者被真嗣用 AT 力场肢解得支离破碎。）

He was dead. What should never have happened was over.  
他死了。本不该发生的一切都结束了。

Shinji looked down at the remains of something that should never have been born. More than blood had been built up and Shinji could see that his organs had been compressed significantly. Most likely he had died long before his head was actually dislodged from the rest of his body, but Shinji felt better thinking about it this way.  
真嗣低头看着那些本不该诞生的残骸。不仅仅是血液，他能看到内脏被严重挤压。很可能在那人的头颅真正从身体上分离之前，他就已经死去多时了，但真嗣觉得这样想会让自己感觉好一些。

He suddenly felt tired and ached all over, especially his hand. It was hard to comprehend what he had just done, but he had been fully aware when he dismembered the man. He knew what he had wanted to do, and so he had done it. Even so though, why was he exhibiting angel powers, for he knew certainly that he had used an AT-field? But then, did that mean that his visions was also a unique trait of an angels?  
他突然感到疲惫不堪，全身疼痛，尤其是手。他难以理解自己刚刚做了什么，但在肢解那个人时，他是完全清醒的。他知道自己想要做什么，于是就做了。即便如此，为什么他会展现出天使的力量，因为他确信自己使用了 AT 力场？但这是否意味着他的幻觉也是天使的独特特征之一？

However, those things would come later. First he should attend to  
然而，那些事情留待以后再考虑。首先，他应该处理

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

Hurrying over to her side he saw that her eyes were glazed over, as though she was not in tune with reality. Shinji couldn't blame her. She had been moments away from being raped and murder, only to then watch her roommate rip apart another human with angel powers. She must be going through something he could even grasp right now.  
他急忙赶到她身边，发现她的眼神呆滞，仿佛与现实脱节。真嗣无法责怪她。她刚刚差点被强奸和谋杀，紧接着又目睹室友用天使之力将另一个人撕成碎片。她现在经历的事情，他甚至无法完全理解。

Slowly though, she seemed to come back to reality as the grayness in her eyes reverted to the normal blue. Slowly she looked up, looking over at the bloody mess in front of her, before turning to see Shinji kneeling next to her. His eyes had returned to their usual brown color.  
不过渐渐地，她的眼神似乎恢复了正常，灰色变回了平常的蓝色。她缓缓抬起头，目光掠过眼前的血腥场面，然后转向跪在她身边的真嗣。他的眼睛也恢复了平常的棕色。

"...shinji..." “...真嗣...”

"I'm here Asuka." "我在这里，明日香。"

Brushing the tangled mess of hair out of her eyes, he felt stickiness in her hair. Moving his hand to the back of her head he felt moisture and realized that she had a head injury. Anger surged through him and he felt a sudden urge to grind what remained into the rapist into nothing but dust. No, he needs to control himself until he understands more about his power, because he understood now that his emotions are whats triggering his powers. Until he can control them at will he needs to be careful.  
他拨开她眼前纠结的乱发，感觉到发丝间的黏腻。将手移到她后脑，他触到了湿润，意识到她头部受了伤。愤怒涌上心头，他突然有种冲动，想把那个强奸犯碾成尘埃。不，他需要控制自己，直到他更了解自己的力量，因为他现在明白，是他的情绪触发了这些力量。在他能随心所欲地控制它们之前，他必须小心行事。

"...Shinji," Asuka whispered again.  
"...真嗣，"明日香再次低声唤道。"

Wordlessly Shinji reached over to the shoulder farthest from him and brought her to his chest. Enveloping her in a tight hug he didn't even given note to the fact that her bare breasts were pressed against the sweatshirt that he was wearing.  
无言地，真嗣伸出手，触碰到离他最远的那边肩膀，将她揽入怀中。他紧紧地拥抱着她，甚至没有注意到她的赤裸胸部紧贴在他穿着的连帽衫上。

"I'm here Asuka," he said again.  
“我在这里，明日香。”他又说了一遍。

All at once her pent up emotions exploded onto his chest. A waterfall of tears cascaded down onto Shinji's chest as Asuka cried out her worries.  
突然间，她积压已久的情绪在他的胸前爆发。泪水如瀑布般倾泻而下，明日香哭喊着宣泄她的忧虑。

Shinji was silent as Asuka cried on him. What could he honestly do? He couldn't take it away. It was something that would always be hovering over her. It is quite possibly the most psychological traumatizing thing that can happen to a woman. The only thing that he could be glad for was that he had prevented the rape from escalating. If he had been too late, like in the possible outcome of the vision, he probably would have committed mass homicide from frustration.  
真嗣沉默地任由明日香在他怀里哭泣。他又能做些什么呢？他无法消除这一切。这阴影将永远笼罩着她。这或许是女性所能遭遇的最严重的心理创伤。他唯一感到庆幸的是，他阻止了强奸的进一步升级。如果他来得太晚，就像那个可能的预见中那样，他可能会因沮丧而犯下大规模谋杀。

He held deep affection for Asuka. He would throw himself off a bridge if it enabled him to protect her. Where did this affection come from? He didn't know really. He had been around her so much that he had grown to just enjoy being near her. To be able to hear her voice as she spoke. The feel of her silky hair if it accidentally brushed against him. The way she walked...floated more like. The feel of her smooth skin if chance happened and he was able to be close enough to her.  
他对明日香怀有深厚的感情。如果跳下桥能保护她，他会毫不犹豫。这种感情从何而来？他并不真正清楚。他一直陪伴在她身边，渐渐地，仅仅是待在她附近就让他感到愉悦。能听到她说话的声音，偶尔她的秀发拂过他的感觉，她走路的样子……更像是飘动。如果有机会近距离接触，她光滑肌肤的触感。

Was it love? 这是爱吗？

Deeper. 更深。

Yes it was deeper. But what went deeper than love? Asuka was truly the first person that he was able to connect with, because they had both been hurt by people. They shared similarities certainly, but Shinji felt that Asuka was the only person that would never leave him. Correction: she wouldn't leave him because she would be hurt just as much as Shinji would be. Shinji filled the space in Asuka's heart that she had hallowed herself. She needed him, just as much as he needed her.  
是的，它更深。但还有什么比爱更深呢？明日香是他真正能够与之相连的第一人，因为他们都曾被他人伤害过。他们的确有相似之处，但真嗣觉得明日香是唯一一个永远不会离开他的人。更正：她不会离开他，因为她会受到和真嗣一样多的伤害。真嗣填补了明日香心中她自己挖空的那部分。她需要他，正如他需要她一样。

Burying his face in her hair, he ran his hands through the hair that flowed behind her back, trying to untangle it as much as possible. It didn't help much, but he felt that it soothed her nonetheless.  
他将脸埋进她的发丝中，双手穿过她背后流淌的长发，尽可能地试图解开那些纠缠的发丝。虽然效果不大，但他觉得这仍然能安抚她。

"Hey...Shinji," said Asuka with a muffled voice as she was still pressed against his chest.  
"嘿...真嗣," 明日香用闷闷的声音说道，她仍然紧贴在他的胸前。

"Hmm?" “嗯？”

"...You're suffocating me."  
"...你快把我闷死了。"

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

Drawing back, Shinji let go of Asuka and indeed saw that her face was slightly blue. He apparently needed to reevaluate his strength.  
真嗣松开手，往后退了一步，确实看到明日香的脸色有些发青。看来他需要重新评估自己的力气了。

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"No...its okay," said Asuka as she leaned into his chest again, though this time Shinji let his arms stay by his side.  
"不...没事的," 明日香再次靠在他的胸前说道，尽管这次真嗣让他的手臂依旧垂在身旁。

Silence passed between them, and the Asuka said something that Shinji had been fearing.  
他们之间陷入了沉默，随后明日香说出了真嗣一直担心的话。

"What did you do to him?"  
"你对他做了什么？"

Shinji hesitated. He thought that Asuka might already know, but wanted to be sure. But was he ready to tell her that he might somehow be connected to the angels? He didn't think so. What if she became fearful of him. He could handle everybody else shunning him as long as Asuka stayed by his side. So instead he said-  
真嗣犹豫了。他觉得明日香可能已经知道了，但想确认一下。但他准备好告诉她，他可能与使徒有某种联系吗？他不这么认为。如果她因此害怕他怎么办。只要明日香在他身边，他可以忍受其他人的疏远。所以他改口说——

"I'd rather not talk about it right now."  
“我现在不想谈这个。”

Asuka knew he was going to say this, but still tried anyway. When Shinji wanted to talk she would be there for him, as he had always been there for her. Instead she pulled to subject away from what he had done and instead said, "I wouldn't mind staying like this forever."  
明日香知道他会这么说，但还是尝试了。当真嗣想倾诉时，她会在他身边，就像他一直陪伴着她一样。相反，她把话题从他所做的事情上引开，转而说道：“我不在乎永远这样下去。”

Understanding that she was shifting the conversation in respect for his wishes, Shinji said, "You know we can't do that."  
意识到她是为了尊重他的意愿而转移话题，真嗣说道：“你知道我们不能那样做。”

"...No I suppose not," here she glanced over at the mauled corpse of the rapists and Shinji felt her shudder.  
“……不，我想也是，”她瞥了一眼那被撕裂的强奸犯尸体，真嗣感觉到她在颤抖。

"I don't want to think about it," said Asuka as she turned back to Shinji's chest, gripping his sweatshirt.  
“我不想去想这些，”明日香说着转回真嗣的胸膛，紧抓着他的运动衫。

"...Don't then. Don't ever think about it. Just remember that I'm here for you."  
"...那就别想了。永远不要去想。只要记住，我在这里陪着你。"

"Hmm. Okay." "嗯，好吧。"

They stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, just meshing with each other, letting the heat from each others bodies keep them warm while the storm raced outside. Asuka shivered though and the moment was broken  
他们就这样待着，仿佛度过了一个永恒，彼此融合，让对方身体的热量温暖自己，而外面的风暴肆虐。但明日香颤抖了一下，这一刻被打破了。

"You cold?" Asked Shinji.  
"你冷吗？" 真嗣问道。

"A little..." "一点点..."

Shinji first took notice that Asuka's shirt lay into two tattered rags and was split down the middle revealing her bare breasts. He tried not to notice that they were unusually perky. Glancing up quickly he saw that she had been watching him intently, as though waiting for a reaction.  
真嗣首先注意到的是，明日香的衬衫变成了两块破布，中间裂开，露出了她的胸部。他尽量不去注意它们异常挺拔。他迅速抬头一看，发现她正专注地盯着他，仿佛在等待他的反应。

"...Wear my sweatshirt then, if you're cold."  
"...那就穿我的运动衫吧，如果你冷的话。"

Asuka continued looking at him intently before saying, "...Thanks. But I'm fine like this."  
明日香继续专注地看着他，然后说道：“……谢谢。但我这样就挺好。”

Shinji blinked several times before uttering a confused, "Huh?"  
真嗣眨了几次眼，困惑地发出一声：“哈？”

Asuka clarified herself. "Whether its on me or not doesn't make that much of a difference. If you wear it then that means I'll just stick close to you. We can share the warmth."  
明日香进一步解释道：“不管是在我身上还是你身上，差别不大。如果你穿了，那我就靠近你一点。我们可以共享这份温暖。”

"But...your...err." "但...你的...呃."

"Yes." "是的。"

Shinji mumbled something very quietly.  
真嗣小声地咕哝了些什么。

"What? Didn't catch that?"  
"什么？没听清？"

"I said that your breasts are exposed," he managed to blurt out.  
"我说你的胸部露出来了。" 他好不容易才脱口而出。

Asuka was silent for a moment and Shinji was sure that she would start hitting him for seeing her breasts, though instead she said, "So you saw them?"  
绫波沉默了一会儿，真嗣确信她会因为看到她的胸部而开始打他，但她却说："那么你看到了？"

"...I wasn't looking or anything...but yeah...I did."  
"...我不是故意看的...但确实...我看到了。"

Asuka sighed and said, "Forget it then and just give me your sweatshirt."  
明日香叹了口气，说道：“算了，那就把你的运动衫给我吧。”

'Wouldn't it have been easier to just take it in the first place instead of teasing me,' thought Shinji.  
“一开始直接拿走不就好了，何必逗我呢，”真嗣心想。

Pulling the sweatshirt over his head he tossed it to a wordless Asuka, while keeping his eyes fix straight ahead.  
他脱下运动衫，径直扔给了沉默的明日香，同时目光始终直视前方。

"Thanks...but you're gonna be cold now."  
"谢谢...但你现在会冷的。"

"I'll be-" "我会——"

"Didn't I say that it didn't matter who wore the sweatshirt, as long as they shared the warmth," said Asuka as she snuggled up next to Shinji.  
""我不是说过吗，谁穿运动衫不重要，只要能分享温暖就行。"" 明日香说着，紧挨着真嗣靠了过去。

"Well...yes, but-" "嗯...是的，但是-"

"Then there shouldn't be any complaints," replied Asuka as she tilted her head onto Shinji's shoulder.  
"那就不该有任何怨言了。" 明日香说着，将头靠在真嗣的肩上。

"I suppose..." "我想也是..."

"Then everything is fine," replied Asuka as she closed her eyes.  
"那么一切都好，" 明日香闭上眼睛回答道。

Shinji sighed and let himself submit to Asuka's will, and really, he enjoyed it.  
真嗣叹了口气，任由自己顺从明日香的意愿，实际上，他也很享受。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"...What?" "...什么？"

"I just realized I never said my thanks...I'm mean...for rescuing me..."  
"我刚刚意识到我从未表达过我的感谢...我的意思是...为了救我..."

"...No, you don't have to, I already know that you appreciate...no, appreciate isn't a word to describe your gratitude."  
"...不，你不必，我已经知道你感激...不，感激这个词远不足以形容你的谢意。"

"Even...so..." "即便...如此..."

'...What was this? Was this honestly happening?' Shinji's brain couldn't even contemplate something like this. What was this softness that was pressed against his cheek? Did Asuka seriously just kiss him on the cheek?  
'...这是怎么回事？这真的发生了吗？' 真嗣的大脑甚至无法理解这样的事情。贴在他脸颊上的这种柔软是什么？难道明日香真的亲了他的脸颊？

It happened in less than a second. It was like...Asuka blindly turned to Shinji and kissed him before turning away. But that instance still felt like a life time to Shinji. What was the significance in it though? Friendship? Love?  
这一切发生不到一秒钟。就像...明日香盲目地转向真嗣，吻了他，然后又转过身去。但对真嗣来说，那一刻仿佛一生一世。然而，这其中的意义何在？是友谊？还是爱情？

Glancing at Asuka with his mouth firmly closed, he saw that she was biting her blood stained lips and Shinji wondered if he didn't have a bloody kiss mark on his cheek.  
他紧闭着嘴瞥向明日香，看到她正咬着沾血的嘴唇，真嗣不禁疑惑自己脸上是否留下了血吻的痕迹。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

"What?" She snapped while blushing furiously.  
“什么？”她气急败坏地红了脸。

"...Err thanks..." "...呃，谢谢..."

"...Whatever," said Asuka as she sank back onto Shinji's shoulders.  
"...随便吧，" 明日香说着又靠回到真嗣的肩膀上。

Shinji could help but feel a grin spread across his face. It was a start at least.  
真嗣忍不住脸上露出了笑容。至少这是个开始。

However...things were about to change  
然而...一切即将改变

Was that a helicopter he heard? No...that was definitely a helicopter.  
他听到的是直升机吗？不...那确实是一架直升机。

He could see the silhouette as it came in for a landing just outside of the square that he had opened up. He was amazed that a helicopter could even land in just a narrow space. But then, why was their a helicopter here in the first place?  
他能看到那轮廓正朝着广场外降落。他惊讶于直升机竟能在如此狭窄的空间着陆。但话说回来，这里为何会有一架直升机呢？

As it landed, Shinji recognized two of the figures that jumped off the helicopter. Looking around at Asuka he saw that she was also watching as Misato and Ritsuko started running towards them.  
当直升机降落时，真嗣认出了从上面跳下来的两个人影。他环顾四周，看到明日香也在注视着，美里和律子正朝他们跑来。

"Get a containment team down here immediately and move that corpse while your at it," said Ritsuko. "I don't want anybody to know about this except for the people here.  
“立刻叫一支封锁小组下来，顺便把那具尸体移走，”律子说道，“除了这里的人，我不想让任何人知道这件事。”

It was something in her face which made Shinji skeptical, almost fearful. What was going on?  
是她的表情让真嗣感到怀疑，甚至有些害怕。到底发生了什么？

As Misato walked towards them, something went fleetingly through Shinji's mind. 'They know what I did and what I used. There gonna restrain me."  
当美里走向他们时，真嗣的脑海中掠过一丝念头。'他们知道我做了什么，用了什么。他们会限制我。'

Standing up abruptly, Shinji was briefly able to see Misato hesitate before she continued walking forward. She was not smiling.  
真嗣突然站起身，短暂地看到美里在继续前行前犹豫了一下。她没有微笑。

"Shinji...I'm sorry but we need you to come to Nerv."  
“真嗣……对不起，但我们需要你来 NERV。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"...I'd rather not have to answer that."  
"...我还是不想回答那个问题。"

"But you know!" "但你知道的！"

"Yes I do...and I tried to stop it, but I have no control over the science department. I'm sorry but we'll have to take you in."  
"是的，我知道...我试图阻止，但我无法控制科学部门。很抱歉，我们得带你走了。"

"And what! Run experiments on me!"  
"“什么！在我身上做实验！”"

Misato's eyes shifted and Shinji could tell that he had hit the nail on the head.  
美里眼神一变，真嗣看得出他正中要害。

At this point Asuka spoke up, "What are you talking about Misato! If Shinji hadn't...done what he did, I would be dead right now. Can you imagine what it was like for me! And now you're taking him away? Why damn it!"  
这时明日香开口了，“美里，你们在说什么呢！如果不是真嗣做了那件事，我现在已经死了。你能想象我当时的感觉吗！而现在你却要把他带走？为什么，该死的！”

"Asuka please, I don't want to argue right now..."  
"明日香，求你了，我现在不想吵架..."

"I don't give a fuck what you want to do! Shinji saved me. Who cares what he _did_ save me!"  
"我才不在乎你想干什么！真嗣救了我。谁在乎他做了什么才救了我！"

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

"No I wont-" "不，我不会-"

Shinji stuck out his hand to stop her.  
真嗣伸出一只手拦住了她。

"It'll be fine..." "没事的……"

"Shin-" "真-

He cut her off by fiercely hugging her, pulling her close to him.  
他猛地抱住她，紧紧地将她拉向自己，打断了她的话。

"Its fine..." "没事的..."

"But-" "但——"

"It won't take long...I promise."  
"不会太久的...我保证。"

"You do?" "真的吗？"

"Course I do. When have I been wrong?"  
“当然，我什么时候错过？”

Asuka raised an eyebrow but said nothing. "Fine...do what you must."  
明日香挑了挑眉，但没说什么。“好吧……你随意。”

Shinji nodded and released his hold on her. Gazing back into her eyes for a moment, he gently brushed the back of his hand against her cheek.  
真嗣点点头，松开了她。他凝视着她的眼睛片刻，温柔地用手指背轻抚她的脸颊。

"Come visit me if you get the change."  
"有机会的话，来看我吧。"

"Yeah...I will." "嗯...我会的。"

Turning to Misato he said, "Okay, I'm ready."  
他转向美里说："好了，我准备好了。"

Misato nodded and turned towards the helicopter with Shinji walking beside her. Shinji couldn't help but notice that she seemed to be putting an unusual amount of distance between herself and Shinji.  
美里点点头，转身向直升机走去，真嗣跟在她身旁。真嗣不禁注意到，她似乎在刻意与自己保持一段不寻常的距离。

'So everyone is suddenly afraid of me are they?' Shinji thought. 'Well, they can't be as scared as I am to find out about myself.'  
'所以大家都突然害怕我了吗？' 真嗣心想。'好吧，他们不可能比我更害怕发现自己。'

Shinji slowly walked towards the helicopter, wondering how long he'd be apart from Asuka.  
真嗣缓缓走向直升机，心中疑惑着自己将与明日香分离多久。

### Chapter 13: Tests

**Hey all, sorry that it took me so long to update this. Honestly speaking, I felt like taking a break after that double post on Halloween, those four days were hectic. Anyways I'm back and working again. Also, I'm gonna do a nice After Impact one shot of Shinji and Asuka (Christmas related of course) so look forward to that. I'm probably putting it out on Christmas Eve, and hopefully another chapter of this on the same day.  
大家好，很抱歉这么久才更新。老实说，万圣节那次双更之后，我感觉需要休息一下，那四天真是忙得不可开交。不管怎样，我回来了，继续工作。另外，我会写一篇关于真嗣和明日香的《后影响》短篇（当然是圣诞主题的），敬请期待。我可能会在圣诞夜发布，希望当天还能更新这一章。**

When was the last time that Shinji had had a dream such as this? For the longest time his dreams had been filled with nothing but bleak futures, bloodshed, and the end of the human race. This dream though, was certainly different. More different in fact then the reality that Shinji was currently living in, and would give almost anything to be living in the dream.  
真嗣上一次做这样的梦是什么时候？很长一段时间以来，他的梦里充斥着黯淡的未来、血腥和人类的终结。然而，这个梦确实不同。实际上，它比真嗣目前所处的现实更加不同，他几乎愿意付出一切来生活在梦中。

Everything was different. No angels, and most of all...no Evangelion. A world where his mother still existed and a father who cared about him. Was it still Tokyo-3? His dream didn't go to that level of precision. He imagined that it was, or at least he hoped that it could have been. He had some how become attached to the city and was rather reluctant to leave it, even in his dream.  
一切都变了。没有天使，最重要的是……没有 EVA。一个母亲依然存在，父亲也关心他的世界。这里还是第三新东京市吗？他的梦并没有细致到那个程度。他想象着是的，或者至少他希望可能是。他不知怎么地对这座城市产生了依恋，即使在梦中也不太愿意离开。

There were other noticeable changes, and rather large at that. He was older, eighteen or nineteen from the look of things, and he had a hair on his face. A little minuscule, but still hard to miss. This was himself after all and he was supposed to know himself well. Though of course now, he wasn't so sure.  
还有其他明显的变化，而且相当大。他看起来更年长，十八九岁的样子，脸上还长出了胡须。虽然很微小，但依然难以忽视。毕竟这是他自己，他应该很了解自己。不过现在，他不太确定了。

Everyone still existed. His friends were of course older, Misato didn't seem to drink at all, (which he thought was somehow inexplicably wrong) Rei was talkative to the point of being annoying, and Asuka...  
所有人依然存在。他的朋友们当然也都长大了，美里似乎滴酒不沾，（这让他觉得有些莫名其妙地不对劲）丽变得健谈到令人烦扰，而明日香……

While he was...embarrassed to admit it, the first thing he noticed was that she was fuller in the chest. He felt sort of disgusted that this was the first thing that he noticed about the aged version of her. Out of all the redeeming features about her, he had to notice that most.  
虽然他...尴尬地承认，他首先注意到的是她的胸部更丰满。他感到有些厌恶，这是他注意到她年长版本的第一件事。在她所有的可取之处中，他偏偏注意到了这一点。

Her hair was relatively the same, at least in color. Now though, it seemed to reach past her waist, and she had abandoned the hair clips that she always wore. Maybe since the Eva's didn't exist she saw no reason to use them. He had never really asked her why she insisted on keeping the receptors on her head, even when they weren't in combat.  
她的头发大体上颜色相同，至少在颜色上。但现在，它似乎垂到了腰部以下，她放弃了总是戴着的那些发夹。也许是因为 Eva 不存在，她觉得没有理由使用它们。他从未真正问过她为什么坚持保留头上的接收器，即使在非战斗时也是如此。

Her facial features were much the same, a little older he supposed, and her cheekbones were possibly more pronounced then before. She seemed more happy though, less reluctant to smile than he had known, and he saw that she had a glimmering smile that made him feel like he was looking at the sun. It was quite painful.  
她的面部特征大体相同，他猜想可能稍微老了一些，颧骨可能比以前更明显。不过她似乎更快乐了，比他所知的更少勉强微笑，他看到她闪烁的笑容让他感觉像是在直视太阳。这相当刺眼。

He saw this all from a different perspective of course, as you normally would in a dream. His older self seemed to be on similar terms with Asuka as he knew that he himself was. Though with less berating and yelling involved from the look of things. In fact, if he didn't know any better, he would guess that they were leaning towards a less friendly relationship and a more romantic one. That was a thought that made him frown slightly. Not in disgust or anything, but just in bemusement. He could only imagine the reaction he'd get from the Asuka he knew if he asked her out on a date.  
当然，他从不同的角度看到了这一切，就像在梦中通常会做的那样。他的年长自我似乎与明日香处于相似的关系，正如他所知道的那样。不过，看起来少了许多责骂和吼叫。事实上，如果他不知道得更多，他会猜测他们正倾向于一种不那么友好的关系，而是一种更浪漫的关系。这个想法让他微微皱眉。不是因为厌恶或其他，只是感到困惑。他只能想象如果他向他所认识的明日香提出约会，她会有什么反应。

'_Like what you see_?' Said a voice to his left.  
'喜欢你所看到的吗？'一个声音从他的左边传来。

Shinji should have known that this was too good to be true, and sure enough the pseudo Asuka was leaning against a wall as she watched his reaction to...the future? A possible future? Or just an imaginative future which Shinji had created on a whim?  
真嗣本该知道这好得令人难以置信，果然，伪明日香正靠在墙上，观察着他对...未来的反应？一个可能的未来？还是真嗣一时兴起创造的一个想象中的未来？

Sighing, resigning to the usual, Shinji said, 'I was wondering when you would show up.'  
叹了口气，无奈地接受这常态，真嗣说道：'我就在想你什么时候会出现。'

'_Oh? Grown accustomed to me have you_?'  
'哦？已经习惯我了吗？'

'In an odd way...yeah, I have.'  
'说来也怪...是的，习惯了。'

'_I'll take that as a compliment. Anyway, like what you see_?'  
'我就当你是在夸我了。话说回来，喜欢你所看到的吗？'

'I'm not really sure what I'm seeing. This is a dream, correct?'  
'我不太确定我看到了什么。这是梦，对吧？'

'_Either that or the people outside have some how entered your mind and have sent you into an imaginative world_.'  
'要么是梦，要么是外面的人不知怎么进入了你的心智，把你送进了一个充满想象的世界。'

'By the people outside...what do you mean?'  
“外面的人……你是什么意思？”

Waving his question off, she replied, '_Never mind. Forget I said anything_.'  
她挥手打断他的疑问，回答道：“算了，别在意。就当我什么都没说。”

'...Fine, be all silent. But answer me this...is this at all possible.'  
“……好吧，保持沉默。但回答我这个问题……这真的有可能吗？”

It took the pseudo Asuka a minute before she finally answered. _'Maybe...though unlikely. This is certainly a possible outcome of the future. But your decisions up till now have moved away from this possible outcome.'_  
伪明日香沉默了一会儿，才终于回答道：'或许吧...虽然可能性不大。这确实是未来可能出现的结果之一。但你至今所做的决定已经偏离了这个可能的未来。'

'...My decisions up till? Sorry! I wasn't aware that I had made wrong choices!'  
'...我的决定至今？抱歉！我并不知道自己做出了错误的选择！'

'_Oh but you have. You've made wrong choices since day one. You had other options, but you just never gave thought to them. Now you have to deal with the future that is currently in store for you.'_  
'哦，但你确实如此。从一开始你就做出了错误的选择。你本有其他选择，但你从未考虑过它们。现在，你只能面对当前为你准备的未来。'

'And that is?' '那是什么？'

Grinning slightly, she said, _'Bleak, and I'll leave it at that.'_  
她微微一笑，说道：'阴郁，我就说到这儿吧。'

'Why is it always like that? Once, just once, I would have enjoyed a normal teenagers life.'  
'为什么总是这样？哪怕一次，我也希望能过上普通青少年的生活。'

'_You can complain all you want, but you never had any choice in the matter really. Your existence is completely wrong as it is.'_ As the pseudo Asuka said this her face hitched upward in an angry snarl for an instance before it went back to its normal impassive look. Shinji was totally dumbstruck, unable to guess what had triggered this sudden emotional outburst.  
“你尽管抱怨吧，但实际上你从未有过选择。你的存在本身就是个错误。”伪明日香说这话时，脸上瞬间闪过一丝愤怒的扭曲，随即又恢复了平常的冷漠表情。真嗣完全愣住了，猜不透是什么触发了这突如其来的情绪爆发。

'What do you mean...my existence is wrong?'  
“你这话什么意思……我的存在是错误的？”

'_Forget it. I've said to much as it is.'_  
“算了。我已经说得够多了。”

'Damn it! Why don't you ever answer my questions!'  
'该死！你为什么从不回答我的问题！'

'_First I'm not supposed to, when your usefulness runs out then maybe I'll tell you some things...only at the end of everything though. It will save you some grief at least, you wont have to dwell on it long, maybe half a second or so.'_  
'首先我不该这么做，当你没用了之后，也许我会告诉你一些事情……但那只会在一切结束的时候。至少这能让你少些痛苦，你不必长时间纠结于此，或许只有半秒钟左右。'

Shinji was not liking where the discussion was going. He felt like he was getting close to the end of a dark tunnel and that some fearful monster was at the end, one that he'd have to battle but didn't have the nerve quite yet.  
真嗣不喜欢这场讨论的走向。他感觉自己正接近一个黑暗隧道的尽头，那里有一头可怕的怪兽在等着他，而他还没有足够的勇气去面对。

So with an almighty pull in his mind, he managed to wrench himself back towards the present. What had started out wonderful had ended in torment. He supposed he wasn't that surprised it ended that way. Though the present wasn't something that he was looking forward to either as he opened his eyes.  
于是，在他的脑海中使出巨大的力量，他设法将自己拉回到现实中。原本美好的开始却以痛苦告终。他想，自己并不惊讶事情会这样结束。尽管现在的情况也不是他所期待的，当他睁开眼睛时。

The first thing he felt was a dull throb in his right hand. Next, he realized that he was laying on a hard, cool surface and seemed fastened to it somehow. Darting his eyes left and right he started taking in his surroundings.  
首先，他感觉到右手传来一阵隐隐的抽痛。接着，他意识到自己躺在一个坚硬而冰冷的表面上，似乎被某种方式固定住了。他迅速左右扫视，开始观察周围的环境。

He was in a room that was not unlike his normal white room, though there was a significant amount of equipment around him to blow the circuit breaker in an average house. Monitors of every kind were position around him with several tables next to him. Shinji craned his neck to try and see what was on the tables, but found that his neck didn't want to move. Squinting down at his neck, he saw that a metal ring had been fastened around it. He suspected that the other parts of his body had similar objects pinning him to the hard operating table, for thats what he suspected he was on now. What were the doing? Dissecting him?  
他身处一个房间，与平常的白色房间颇为相似，但周围大量的设备足以让普通家庭的断路器跳闸。各种监视器环绕着他，旁边还有几张桌子。真嗣伸长脖子试图看清桌上的东西，却发现脖子动弹不得。他眯起眼睛看向自己的脖子，发现一个金属环固定在那里。他猜测身体的其他部位也有类似的物体将他固定在这张坚硬的手术台上，这就是他现在所怀疑的。他们在做什么？解剖他吗？

Everything came back to him. The vision, the subsequent attempt of the rape and his fury and blood lust as he prevented it, the moment afterwards while he cradled Asuka in his arms. He remembered now why his right hand felt like he had smashed it repeatedly into a brick wall.  
一切记忆都回来了。那个幻象，紧接着的强奸未遂和他阻止时的愤怒与嗜血欲望，以及事后他怀抱着明日香的那一刻。现在他终于明白为什么自己的右手感觉像是反复砸在砖墙上一样。

So he was at Nerv...right? Well, it made sense to think that. But how many days had gone by since then? For he couldn't remember waking up before now. Had they drugged him? If they thought he was going to be uncooperative then he figured they would.  
所以他是在 NERV...对吧？嗯，这样想合情合理。但自从那以后过去了多少天呢？因为他现在才刚刚醒来，之前的记忆一片空白。他们给他下药了吗？如果他们认为他会不合作，那么他猜他们会这么做。

Squinting around the room again he finally noticed that he was covered in wires. Metallic wires with white pads to hold them in place seemed to be position appropriately around his body. He felt two on his head, several on his arms and legs, and possibly three on his chest. Brain waves...heart beat...what else could they be looking at? His blood maybe? That last one made sense if they suspected he had been contaminated.  
再次眯眼打量房间，他终于注意到自己身上布满了电线。金属线带着白色垫片，似乎恰当地固定在他身体的各个部位。他感觉到头上有两根，手臂和腿上各有几根，胸前可能还有三根。脑电波...心跳...他们还在观察什么呢？也许是血液？如果他们怀疑他被污染了，最后一个猜测倒是说得通。

So he had exhibited angel powers huh? He wasn't sure who was more scared: himself, or everything person that knew what he had done, though with the exception of Asuka he supposed. He had remembered how Misato shunned away from him while they had walked towards the helicopter.  
所以他展示了天使般的力量，是吧？他不确定谁更害怕：是他自己，还是所有知道他所做之事的人，尽管除了明日香，他猜想。他记得在走向直升机时，美里是如何避开他的。

He heard a door slide open...  
他听到一扇门滑开了……

"No...no, I'll be fine. We've taken sufficient precautions so something like that won't happen. ...The commander specifically asked me to talk to him alone, so your presence here is unnecessary. Yes there are cameras in the room. If something should happen you may come in. ...Very well then."  
不……不，我会没事的。我们已经采取了足够的预防措施，所以那种事不会发生。……指挥官特别要求我单独和他谈谈，所以你在这里是不必要的。是的，房间里有摄像头。如果发生什么事，你可以进来。……那就这样吧。

Shinji, though still slightly disoriented was able to place the voice as Ritsuko's. What had she ment by questions?  
尽管仍有些迷茫，真嗣还是辨认出了那是律子的声音。她所说的‘问题’是什么意思？

As her face came into view, Shinji noticed that her voice seemed to be expressionless. If she had any fear for him, she was hiding it expertly.  
当她的面容映入眼帘时，真嗣注意到她的声音似乎毫无感情。如果她对他有任何恐惧，她都隐藏得滴水不漏。

"Shinji...can you hear me?"  
“真嗣……你能听到我说话吗？”

Unwillingly he replied back with a low, "...Yeah."  
他无奈地低声回应，“……嗯。”

"I'm sorry that all these," she hesitated, "precautions are necessary. But I'm sure you can understand how worried we all are about you."  
“很抱歉这些……”她顿了顿，“预防措施是必要的。但我相信你能理解我们大家有多担心你。”

'Worried about yourself more like,' thought Shinji bitterly.  
"“更像是担心你自己吧，”真嗣苦涩地想。

"Anyway...since you're awake now I was hoping that we could talk for a while."  
"总之...既然你现在醒了，我希望我们可以聊一会儿。"

"About what? You know about myself then I do. What could you possibly learn from talking to me?"  
"聊什么？你对我了解得比我对自己还多。你还能从我这里学到什么？"

Ritsuko completely disregarded his question and asked, "How do you feel?"  
律子完全无视了他的问题，问道："你现在感觉如何？"

"Like concrete is encasing my entire body."  
"就像混凝土包裹了我的全身。"

"So you can't move." "所以你动不了。"

"Thats what I just said."  
"我刚说的就是这个。"

"Okay then...do you have anything you would like to know?"  
"好吧……你有什么想知道的吗？"

"Plenty, though I'm sure you'd answer not even half of them, so I'll just ask instead what day it is."  
"很多，不过我确信你连一半都不会回答，所以我还是直接问今天几号吧。"

"Its Wednesday, you have been out for nearly two days."  
"今天是星期三，你已经昏迷将近两天了。"

"Keeping me sedated?" "让我一直处于镇静状态？"

Ritsuko avoided eye contact with him; he got the picture.  
律子避开了他的目光；他明白了她的意思。

"Now then...do you feel and different then you did two weeks ago."  
"那么现在...你感觉和两周前有什么不同吗？"

Shinji frowned for a second but saw no reason why he shouldn't answer her question. "Not in the slightest."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，但没看出有什么理由不回答她的问题。“一点也不。”

"Physically and _mentally?"_  
“身体和心理上？”

"Nope feels pretty much the same," replied Shinji with a sarcastic smirk. He was gonna make this as tough as possible for her.  
"“没有，感觉几乎一样，”真嗣带着讽刺的微笑回答。他打算让她尽可能地感到困难。”

"How did you learn about Asuka's...close encounter then?"  
"你是怎么知道明日香的那次...亲密遭遇的？"

Her question took Shinji aback slightly, but at least he saw that she was disgusted at what could have happened.  
她的提问让真嗣稍感意外，但至少他看出她对可能发生的事情感到厌恶。

"Premonition, I guess." He had chosen the wrong choice of words.  
"预感吧，我想。"他选错了用词。

"And have you been having these premonitions frequently?"  
"你经常有这些预感吗？"

Again her words caught him slightly by surprise. Hesitating for a second he said, "I call them more of dreams...but whatever"  
她的问话再次让他略感意外。他犹豫了一瞬，答道：“我更愿意称之为梦境……但无论如何。”

"So then you dreamed about this happening?"  
"那么你是梦到这件事会发生吗？"

"I wasn't sleeping...but I suppose I could have passed out."  
"我并没有在睡觉...但我想我可能是昏过去了。"

"What did you see?" "你看到了什么？"

This question did not catch Shinji off guard, snarling back his answer he said, "You don't want to know."  
这个问题并没有让真嗣措手不及，他咆哮着回答道：“你不会想知道的。”

Ritsuko winced for a second, whether it was his tone of voice or what he had said, he didn't know.  
理津子微微皱眉，不知是因为他的语气还是他所说的话，他不得而知。

"No, I suppose we can leave that particular detail out. So? How did you find where she was?"  
“不，我想我们可以省略那个细节。那么？你是怎么找到她的位置的？”

Shinji honestly had to think about that for a minute. He remembered recognizing the window that she had been standing in front of.  
真嗣认真地想了一会儿。他记得自己认出了她所站的那扇窗户。

"...I don't remember that part very well...I mean," he swallowed. "I heard her...or not her, but what could have been her. Its hard to explain. I heard the her that could have been...what I had seen back in the apartment. Her voice just sorta...carried me onward I guess..."  
"...那部分我记得不太清楚了...我是说，" 他咽了咽口水。"我听到了她...或者说，可能是她的声音。这很难解释。我听到了那个可能成为的她...就是我在公寓里看到的那个她。她的声音就像是...带着我继续前进，我想..."

"You act as though you were able to see the future."  
"你表现得好像你能预见未来似的。"

"...Its not the future, just a possible outcome of the future. The future is changing almost every second based on the actions of humans."  
"...这不是未来，只是未来可能的一种结果。未来几乎每时每刻都在根据人类的行为而变化。"

"And so your actions canceled that possible outcome of her dying."  
"所以你的行为取消了那个她可能死亡的结果。"

"Yes." "是的。"

"Have you had anything similar to this before?"  
"你以前有过类似的经历吗？"

Without hesitating, Shinji replied, "No...this is the first time that I've ever experience this, at least as far as the whole future thing goes."  
毫不犹豫地，真嗣回答道：“没有...这是我第一次经历这种事，至少就整个未来而言是第一次。”

"Let me ask you this...were you conscious of what you were doing to that man?"  
"让我问你这个问题...你对那个人所做的事，你当时有意识吗？"

Shinji had to hold back a snarl as he replied, "Man is a very loose way to describe that bastard, but yeah, I fully understood what I was doing when I killed him."  
真嗣强忍着咆哮回答道：“用‘人’来形容那个混蛋实在是太宽松了，但没错，我完全明白我在杀他时做了什么。”

"Did you enjoy it?" "你享受吗？"

Shinji looked blankly back at her before he said, "I part of me did sure, I wanted to make it as painful for him as possible before he died. Would I do it again? Certainly!"  
真嗣茫然地回望着她，然后说道：“我的一部分确实这么想过，我想在他死前尽可能让他痛苦。我会再做一次吗？当然会！”

"So then you know that you used something similar to an AT-field."  
“那么你就知道你使用了类似于 AT 力场的东西。”

"I don't know why you call it something _similar_ to an AT-field. Thats what I used. Even I recognized that."  
“我不知道你为什么说它类似于 AT 力场。那就是我用的东西。连我自己都认出来了。”

"...Fine then. How did you use it."  
"...好吧。你是怎么使用它的。"

"Beats me. I just got really pissed, and felt like killing him. Suddenly his arm went flying. After that it felt like my body was on autopilot. All I really had to do was think about hurting him and my...whatever I have inside, would do the rest."  
"我也不清楚。我只是非常愤怒，想要杀了他。突然间他的手臂就飞了出去。之后我感觉自己的身体像是自动操作一样。我只需要想着伤害他，我体内的...无论是什么力量，就会完成剩下的工作。"

Ritsuko sat still for a few seconds before slouching in a nearby chair and pulling out a cigarette.  
律子静静地坐了几秒钟，然后颓然坐在旁边的椅子上，掏出一支烟。

"Do you have any idea what's wrong with me," Shinji suddenly asked after a few moments of silence.  
"你知道我有什么问题吗？" 沉默片刻后，真嗣突然问道。

Ritsuko puffed away on her cigarette for a few moments before stabbing it into a nearby ashtray.  
律子抽了几口烟，然后将其捻灭在附近的烟灰缸里。

"No...we don't. And thats the worrisome part. Your brain shows no sign of mental contamination and we can't pick up a trace of pattern blue in your blood."  
"不...我们不知道。这才是令人担忧的部分。你的大脑没有显示出精神污染的迹象，我们也没能在你的血液中检测到蓝色模式的痕迹。"

"So, what is your diagnose."  
"那么，你的诊断是什么？"

Shrugging Ritsuko said, "I don't have one currently. I have theory's, but thats all they are."  
耸了耸肩，赤木律子说：“目前我还没有确切的诊断。我有一些理论，但那只是理论而已。”

"I'd rather hear an explanation than none at all. I'm more worried about whats wrong with myself more than everyone else probably is."  
"我宁愿听到一些解释，而不是什么都没有。我更担心自己的问题，可能比其他任何人都更甚。"

"That may be true I suppose...okay then. First I theorize that this has something to do with Eva Unit 01. You must have realized yourself, that every time you step out of that thing, something changes in you. Something that you might not have thought before, or something that you would have reacted differently to if you had not been piloting it. Furthermore, you seem much more aggressive and produce subsequent mood swings that can be...rather harsh at times. I've also noticed that your brain waves have changed since your first synchronization test."  
"那可能是真的，我想……好吧。首先，我推测这与 Eva 初号机有关。你自己一定也意识到了，每次你从那东西里出来，你都会有所变化。有些事情你以前可能没想过，或者有些事情如果你没有驾驶它，你的反应会不同。此外，你似乎变得更加好斗，随之而来的是情绪波动，有时可能会相当激烈。我还注意到，自从你的第一次同步测试以来，你的脑波已经改变了。"

"...So what...?" "……所以呢……？"

"Unit 01 is affecting you somehow. We can dispute that fact. Don't forget that the Eva had forced a direct synchronization with you several times by connecting directly with your nervous system. It is possibly that during those times, though few, you inadvertently took some of the Eva's blood. Don't forget that the Eva's are a byproduct of the first angel, Adam."  
"初号机在以某种方式影响你。这一点我们可以争论。别忘了，Eva 曾多次通过直接连接你的神经系统，强行与你进行同步。有可能在这些时候，尽管次数不多，你无意中吸收了一些 Eva 的血液。别忘了，Eva 是第一使徒亚当的副产品。"

"I have angel blood in me then?"  
"那我体内有天使的血统吗？"

"Its a possibly, and it may not be that specific way which I just listed. There are several other theory's but that is the most plausible at his moment."  
"这有可能，而且不一定是我刚才提到的那种方式。还有其他几种理论，但目前看来这个最合理。"

"Does Misato know about this."  
"美里知道这件事吗？"

"Very vaguely. The commander gave me specific orders to act as though I was the only one to know about this...and some of the specifics."  
"非常模糊。指挥官给了我具体的命令，要我表现得好像只有我知道这件事...以及一些细节。"

"I'm some what glad..." "我有些庆幸..."

"You should be...she was worried."  
"你应该庆幸...她很担心。"

"How did you guys even know where I was?"  
"你们怎么知道我在哪儿的？"

"...We had...been keeping tabs on you since the last angel incident."  
"...自从上次天使事件后，我们...一直在关注你。"

"You what!" "你们在搞什么！"

Shrugging Ritsuko said, "You have to look at it from our perspective. You had gotten out of control during that last battle and we still weren't one hundred percent sure you were contamination free. So we had Nerv person watching you twenty four-seven, even when Misato wasn't there."  
耸了耸肩，律子说道：“你得从我们的角度来看待这件事。你在那场战斗中失控了，而且我们仍然不能百分百确定你没有受到污染。所以我们安排了 NERV 的人员全天候监视你，即使美里不在的时候也是如此。”

Shinji clenched his teeth together. "So somebody had been following me that day."  
真嗣咬紧了牙关。“所以那天有人在跟踪我。”

"Yes, when he saw what you were going to do he decide to inform us. Actually, we had been ready to call you back to run some tests when the call came. Misato had actually been trying to dissuade us from that. She wasn't able to do much though when the order from the commander came down to detain you."  
“是的，当他看到你要做什么时，他决定通知我们。实际上，我们正准备打电话叫你回来进行一些测试，就在这时电话来了。美里其实一直在试图劝阻我们不要这么做。但当指挥官下达命令要拘留你时，她也没能做太多。”

Shinji grimaced, "As usual my father is the root of all this."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，“一如既往，我父亲是这一切的根源。”

Ritsuko was silent for minute as Shinji continued to glare angrily up at the ceiling. Finally breaking the silence he said, "So, am I going to be stuck on this table forever or are you going to throw me into solitary confinement. Can I at least get something to eat-"  
律子沉默了一会儿，而真嗣继续愤怒地瞪着天花板。最终打破沉默，他说道，“那么，我要一直躺在这张桌子上吗，还是会被关进单人牢房？至少能给我点吃的吗——”

"I'm not quite done with questions, I've got something to ask you...more personal."  
“我还没问完问题，我有点私人的事要问你...更私密些。”

Shinji sighed and said, "Whatever gets this over with faster."  
真嗣叹了口气，说道：“只要能快点结束，什么都行。”

"Firstly, and I'm sure you realized it yourself, your...powers, are strictly controlled by your emotions at this point. Before, when you were angry, you were able to do that. Its not likely that you will be able to control them at all in the first place."  
“首先，我相信你自己也意识到了，你的……能力，目前完全受你的情绪控制。之前，当你生气时，你就能做到那样。一开始你就不太可能控制它们。”

"So I can never get angry again?"  
“那我以后再也不能生气了吗？”

"...Well for now we've managed to suppress it I think. We had developed some...chemicals to use in case we got the chance to examine an angels body. That chemical is currently flowing through your blood stream. It should be enough to suppress your powers for now."  
"...嗯，目前我们似乎已经成功压制了它。我们研发了一些...化学物质，以备有机会检查使徒的身体时使用。那种化学物质现在正流经你的血液。它应该足以暂时抑制你的能力。"

"So I'm a human guinea pig, big deal."  
"所以我成了人类小白鼠，有什么大不了的。"

"Secondly...I had something that I wanted to ask you...regarding Asuka."  
"其次...我有些事情想问你...关于明日香。"

Shinji's eyes...which had been rather glazed and unfocused as though he hadn't cared about the conversation up till this point, suddenly shot upwards and then narrowed into slits.  
真嗣的眼睛...之前还显得相当呆滞且心不在焉，仿佛他对这场对话一直漠不关心，此刻却突然向上抬起，然后眯成了细缝。

Trying to suppress a snarl, he said, "What about her..."  
他试图压抑一声咆哮，问道：“她怎么了...”

Ritsuko hesitated for a second. This was something that she hadn't wanted to ask, but knew that it was important nonetheless."  
律子犹豫了一秒钟。这是她本不想问的问题，但她也知道这至关重要。

"Shinji...this is rather personal, so I'm just going to be blunt about it. We don't know if whatever you have is transferrable...if it is well, with regards to Asuka's well being-"  
"真嗣...这有点私人，所以我直说了。我们不知道你身上的东西是否可传染...如果是的话，那么，关于明日香的安危——"

Shinji finally got what she aiming at and his entire body surged forward, straining at the steel rings that bound his body to the cold surface. Ritsuko had barely moved a muscle. She had been expecting this type of reaction.  
真嗣终于明白了她的意图，整个身体猛地向前一冲，被钢环束缚的身体紧贴着冰冷的表面。律子几乎没动一下。她早就预料到了这种反应。

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN ASKING SOMETHING LIKE THAT!"  
"你他妈的问这种问题是什么意思！"

"Shinji please calm down. It is a legitimate question and I need to know-"  
"真嗣，请冷静下来。这是一个合理的问题，我需要知道——"

"I DON'T CARE. GO BACK TO MY BASTARD OF A FATHER AND TELL HIM HE CAN SHOVE HIS QUESTION STRAIGHT UP HIS-"  
"我不在乎。回去告诉我那混蛋父亲，让他把他的问题直接塞进他的——"

"Would you prefer it if I asked Asuka myself-"  
"如果我亲自问明日香，你会更愿意吗——"

If the chemical that had been administered to Shinji's body, had failed, Ritsuko's head would be rolling around on the floor right now with a fountain of blood spewing out of it.  
如果注射进真嗣体内的化学药物失效了，那么现在律子的头颅恐怕正滚落在地板上，鲜血如喷泉般四溅。

Shinji's body surged upward again and Ritsuko was surprised that the steel braces held. Even if Shinji wasn't able to use an AT-field she suspect that his hands would work just as well to break a persons neck. She doubted that the security she had left outside the door would be able to make it to her in time and would probably be wheeling her out on a stretcher.  
真嗣的身体再次猛地向上挺起，律子惊讶于那些钢制支架竟然承受住了。即便真嗣无法使用 AT 力场，她怀疑他的双手同样能轻易扭断一个人的脖子。她怀疑门外留下的安保人员能否及时赶到，或许他们只能用担架将她抬出去。

Shinji meanwhile was in a total maniacal rage.  
与此同时，真嗣正处于一种完全疯狂的暴怒之中。

"IF YOU SO MUCH AS EVEN THINK OF BRINGING THAT UP WITH HER, I'LL TEAR YOUR-"  
"你要是敢在她面前提那件事，我非撕了你不可-"

"Shinji calm down already, and just answer yes or no!"  
"真嗣，冷静点，直接回答是或不是就行了！"

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK! DO YOU HONESTLY THINK WE'VE DONE THAT!"  
"你他妈的以为呢！你真以为我们会那么做吗！"

"I have to have an answer. Think about it this way, if whatever changed with you was integrated into your DNA, then if you fathered a child you would have a chance of passing on that gene."  
"我必须得到一个答案。这么想吧，如果发生在你身上的变化已经融入了你的 DNA，那么如果你有了孩子，你就有可能将这个基因传给下一代。"

"Then why the hell do you automatically associated that with Asuka!"  
"那你他妈的为什么立刻就联想到明日香！"

"Because she is the closest human that you could love."  
"因为她是你最亲近的、你可能会爱上的人类。"

"Bull Shit!" "胡说八道！"

"Just answer the question..."  
"就回答问题……"

"...No! Is that good enough for you, or do you want to take a semen sample?"  
"……不！这样你满意了吗，还是你想取个精液样本？"

Ritsuko face twisted upward into a grimace. "If you weren't going to cooperate than I had considered that option."  
律子脸上扭曲成一副痛苦的表情。“如果你不打算合作，那我确实考虑过那个选项。”

Shinji snorted while Ritsuko sighed.  
真嗣哼了一声，而律子叹了口气。

"Are we done here?" Shinji asked abruptly.  
“我们这里结束了吗？”真嗣突然问道。

"...For now yes...though I need you to cooperated with me on something."  
"...目前是的...不过我需要你配合我做一件事。"

"...What?" "...什么？"

"I have been asked to see what adverse effects, if any at all, Unit 01 has on you currently. I'm going to release the lock on the bracers so I want you to promise me that you wont run away, or try to injure any personal. There are armed guards outside that wont hesitate to pin you to the floor."  
"我被要求检查零号机对你目前是否有任何不良影响。我要解除腕带上的锁定，所以请你答应我不要逃跑，也不要试图伤害任何人。外面有武装警卫，他们不会犹豫将你按倒在地。"

"Did my father ask you to do this also."  
"我父亲也让你这么做的吗？"

Ritsuko hesitated for a second but said, "Yes..."  
律子犹豫了一瞬，但还是答道：“是的……”

"Why do you always act like his lapdog."  
“为什么你总是表现得像他的跟屁虫。”

Ritsuko ignored his question.  
律子无视了他的问题。

"Okay...I'm releasing the locks...don't try anything."  
"好了...我正在解开锁...别耍花招。"

"Like I could," mumbled Shinji as he felt the blood flowing more properly in his arms and legs. Sitting up properly he glanced around the room once before settling on Ritsuko's face. She was not smiling, rather, she seemed nervous now that Shinji had been released from his restraints. This made him feel slightly better, at least she feared him properly now.  
"我哪敢啊，""真嗣咕哝着，感觉到血液更顺畅地流过他的四肢。他坐直身子，环顾了一下房间，然后将目光定格在律子的脸上。她没有微笑，相反，现在真嗣被解开束缚后，她显得有些紧张。这让他感觉稍微好些，至少她现在对他有了适当的畏惧。"

Grinning slightly he said, "Lead the way, doctor Akagi."  
他微微一笑，说道：""带路吧，赤木博士。""

---

There really wasn't much left of them so she settled on chewing her lips instead...though that was slowing starting to break down also. Asuka's nails, which she normally kept moderately long, were now little more than stubs; she had even made one of them bleed. She had lost track of time somehow, even though it had barely been two days since she had last seen Shinji.  
实际上，他们所剩无几，于是她转而咬住嘴唇...尽管这也渐渐开始崩溃。明日香平时留得适中的指甲，如今已变得短小不堪；她甚至弄破了一个，流了血。她不知怎的失去了时间感，尽管距离上次见到真嗣才不过两天。

She was constantly irritable to the point that Misato didn't want to spend longer than a few minutes in her company. Her classmates probably got it worst though, as they had to put up with her for eight hours. She had snapped earlier that day, throwing her notebook in the teachers face and kicking Touji's desk over...with him still in it of course. He was now in the hospital with a significant concussion. She had been lucky to not get suspended and wondered if Misato hadn't intervened. She hated that for some reason.  
她持续处于易怒状态，以至于美里不想在她身边多待哪怕几分钟。她的同学们可能遭受最严重，因为他们得忍受她八个小时。那天早些时候，她爆发了，把笔记本扔到老师脸上，还踢翻了东治的桌子...当然，他还在桌子里。他现在因严重脑震荡住进了医院。她侥幸没有被停学，不禁怀疑是不是美里从中斡旋。她讨厌这种感觉，不知为何。

Currently, she was pacing back and forth in the living room, the T.V. blaring in the background. The thing that kept eating at her was the fact that she had been forbidden to see Shinji, even when she had promised him that she would. What didn't they want her to see? Was his condition so bad that he wasn't allowed to see anyone? Were they running tests on him like he had said back in the...  
眼下，她正在客厅里来回踱步，电视在背景中大声播放着。让她心烦意乱的是，她被禁止见真嗣，尽管她曾向他承诺过会去。他们不想让她看到什么？他的状况真的那么糟糕，以至于不能见任何人吗？他们是不是像他之前说的那样，在他身上做着实验……

She tried her best to ignore that. It was bad enough that she woke up every night to that same nightmare drenched in a cold sweat. The last thing she needed was to think about it while she was awake. She was already in a terrible state.  
她尽力不去想这些。每晚醒来都伴随着那个同样的噩梦，浑身冷汗，已经够糟糕的了。她最不需要的就是在清醒时还去想这些。她已经处于极度的痛苦之中。

She was still steadfast against her opinion that whatever...phase Shinji was going through, as she put it, had no harm in it whatsoever. She had been a little afraid when he had shown outright cruelty, but it was more the fact that she was worried that he would have changed, that he would have been different than the Shinji that she knew. Those few moments alone together had blown all those worries out of her mind. Though would he be the same after he returned from Nerv? They would certainly examine him and try to determine if he had been contaminated. What would they do if he was? Would they lock him up in some soft room and feed him through a small pocket in the door? He wasn't insane!  
她依然坚定地认为，无论真嗣正在经历什么...阶段，正如她所说的，没有任何害处。当她看到他表现出明显的残忍时，她确实有些害怕，但更多的是担心他会改变，变得不再是她所认识的那个真嗣。那几次单独相处的时刻已经消除了她所有的担忧。尽管他回来后还会是原来的样子吗？NERV 肯定会对他进行检查，试图确定他是否受到了污染。如果他真的被污染了，他们会怎么做？会不会把他关在某个软房间里，通过门上的小孔喂食？他并没有疯！

As Asuka's mind continued to sort through these questions, Misato got off the phone with Ritsuko and entered the living room.  
当明日香继续思考这些问题时，美里结束了与律子的电话，走进了客厅。

"Asuka-" "明日香——"

"What?" She snapped back, not even looking at Misato's face.  
“什么？”她猛地回过神来，甚至没有看美里的脸。

"I just got off the phone with Ritsuko at Nerv..."  
"我刚和 NERV 的律子通完电话..."

This briefly halted Asuka's pacing.  
这让明日香暂时停下了踱步。

"So...what?" "所以...怎样？"

"Shinji's awake..." "真嗣醒了..."

"By awake you mean that he hasn't been awake till now." She said all this very slowly.  
"你说他醒了，是指他之前一直没醒。" 她慢条斯理地说道。"

"They had to sedate him," Misato explained patiently, "they had to run some tests on him...examine his brain waves and what not. They didn't think he'd like that."  
"他们不得不给他注射镇静剂，" 美里耐心地解释道，"他们需要对他进行一些测试...检查他的脑电波之类的。他们觉得他不会喜欢那样。"

"So they did it without his consent," snarled Asuka.  
"所以他们未经他同意就做了这件事，"明日香咆哮道。

Misato hesitated, "I suppose you could look at it that way."  
美里犹豫了一下，"我想你可以这么看。"

"So now what are they going to do with him," said Asuka trying to keep her voice at a normal volume.  
"那他们现在打算怎么处置他，"明日香努力让自己的声音保持正常音量说道。

"They want to run some tests with Unit 01 and him. They believe that his state might have been influenced somehow by Unit 01. Also they want me down there to witness it...and they wanted to know if you could be present."  
"他们想用零号机和他进行一些测试。他们认为他的状态可能受到了零号机的影响。此外，他们希望我到场见证...并且想知道你是否能出席。"

"...So what...I'm going to see him through a gigantic piece of glass?"  
"...所以...我要通过一块巨大的玻璃看他？"

"Isn't it better than nothing? You've been anxious ever since...he left, and now you have a chance to see him and your not going to take it?"  
"总比什么都没有好吧？自从他离开后，你就一直焦虑不安，现在有机会见到他，你却不打算抓住这个机会吗？"

"Its not the same as standing in front of him."  
"站在他面前是不一样的。"

"But he'd be glad that you were there. I'm sure he'd feel better if he knew you were watching."  
"但他会很高兴你在那里。我确信如果他知道你在看着，他会感觉好些。"

Asuka eyed Misato, slightly unsure whether she should take the invitation or not. In truth, she wanted to, but she thought there were other implications behind her being there. If she was there Shinji might feel better, but then again, if she was there he might read it another way that she was something that they were able to control him with. She hated the idea that Shinji might be forced into something that he doesn't want to do because she was basically a hostage. Even so, her desire to see Shinji won over her fears.  
明日香打量着美里，略微不确定是否应该接受这个邀请。实际上，她想去，但她认为她出现在那里可能有其他含义。如果她在那里，真嗣可能会感觉好些，但另一方面，如果她在那里，他可能会解读为她是一种用来控制他的手段。她讨厌真嗣可能因为她是某种人质而被强迫做他不想做的事情的想法。即便如此，她想见真嗣的愿望战胜了她的恐惧。

"Fine, I'll go." "好吧，我去。"

"I'm sure it will mean a lot to him," said Misato.  
"我相信这对他意义重大，"美里说。"

Asuka almost snorted. "It better, this is a favor for him and when he returns I'm going to be sure he pays me back."  
明日香几乎嗤之以鼻。"最好如此，这是为他做的，等他回来我一定要让他还我这个人情。"

Misato rolled her eyes knowingly as she turned to get ready.  
美里心领神会地翻了个白眼，转身准备起来。

---

It felt familiar...and what? Good? That was something he never expected to feel while sitting inside an entry plug. It was warm also...more warm than normal, like human blood he guessed, and something that he had smelled before in there but never really gave any thought to it. Why did he think it smelled like-  
这种感觉很熟悉……还有，是什么呢？好？坐在插入栓里他从未想过会有这种感觉。也很温暖……比平时更温暖，像是人类的血液，他猜想，还有在那里闻到过但从未真正在意过的某种气味。为什么他会觉得那气味像——

"Shinji you ready?" Came Ritsuko's voice over the intercom.  
“真嗣，准备好了吗？” 律子的声音通过对讲机传来。

"...What? ...Right, sure whenever."  
"...什么？...好吧，当然，随时都行。"

"We're gonna take this slow so just listen to what I tell you and we can get this over with. I'm just as anxious as you are."  
"我们要慢慢来，所以你只需听我的指示，我们就能尽快结束。我和你一样紧张。"

Shinji rather doubted that but closed his eyes and started concentrating. He had been told that the purpose of this test was to first: see if he could still sync with Unit 01, and second: to see if any changes happened to him while he was inside the entry plug. This last thing worried him. By changes...well that left a lot open for discussion. They way he saw it, they could be mental or physical.  
真嗣对此表示怀疑，但还是闭上眼睛开始集中精神。他被告知这次测试的目的首先是：看看他是否还能与初号机同步，其次是：看看他在插入栓内时是否发生了任何变化。这最后一点让他担忧。所谓变化...嗯，这有很多可讨论的空间。在他看来，这些变化可能是心理上的，也可能是生理上的。

"Inserting entry plug into Unit 01...stabilizers in place...umbilical cord attached...pilot life signs normal, brain waves normal, heartbeat normal...no irregular patterns."  
将插入栓插入初号机...稳定器就位...脐带电缆连接...驾驶员生命体征正常，脑波正常，心率正常...无异常模式。

Ritsuko nodded once at the stream of information and said to Shinji, "Okay...just do what you normally do and try syncing with the Eva. We have a team on standby in case something happens so..."  
律子对这一连串信息点了点头，对真嗣说：“好的...就按平常那样做，尝试与 Eva 同步。我们有团队随时待命，以防万一...”

Shinji heard a small quaver in her voice as she trailed off and for a minute felt that he had heard a small amount of compassion in her voice. He had long resigned to the fact that she only cared about scientific aspects and disregarded human life for those ideals. Now he thought his father was the one who was forcing her to do these things.  
真嗣听到她声音中微弱的颤抖，当她话音渐弱时，有那么一刻，他感觉自己听到了她声音中的一丝同情。他早已接受了这个事实：她只关心科学层面，为了这些理想而忽视人的生命。现在他觉得是他的父亲在强迫她做这些事。

Concentrating had become second nature to him. In truth, he felt no different while trying to sync with Unit 01 then he would while lounging on the couch, or reading a book. The same concept still applied. Or maybe he was so engrossed in what he was doing he didn't recognize his surroundings. Course, his surroundings weren't overly exciting.  
集中精神对他来说已是家常便饭。实际上，他在尝试与初号机同步时，感觉和躺在沙发上或读书时并无二致。原理依旧相同。或许他太过专注于手头的事情，以至于忽略了周围的环境。当然，他的环境也并不那么令人兴奋。

Pushing his mind further into the depths of his subconscious he brought up several memories of his childhood, none of them very happy. He had always been somewhat of a loner. Instead he conjured up a mental image of what Asuka would do when he was allowed to return. His mind tacked on the possible _if,_ though he brushed it off. If he was lucky, and after avoiding the beating she'd be sure to unleash, maybe he'd be able to convince her to cook dinner for once. He had never asked that, afraid that she only ever wanted to make breakfast occasionally. Though he wasn't complaining, he enjoyed the breaks that she gave him and even suspected she liked cooking sometimes, if only to keep up her skills.  
他将思绪更深地推入潜意识深处，唤起了几段童年的记忆，没有一段是愉快的。他一直有点孤僻。相反，他想象着当自己被允许回去时，明日香会怎么做。他的脑海中附加了可能的“如果”，尽管他很快将其抛诸脑后。如果他幸运的话，躲过了她肯定会施加的殴打，也许他能说服她偶尔做一次晚饭。他从没提过这个要求，担心她只是偶尔想做早餐。虽然他并不抱怨，他享受她给他的休息时间，甚至怀疑她有时喜欢做饭，哪怕只是为了保持技能。

He felt his mind slip suddenly and knew that he was going off track with his imagination. He had momentarily forgoten where he was.  
他突然感到思绪飘忽，意识到自己的想象力已经偏离了轨道。他一时忘记了身在何处。

'_You're a real airhead sometimes. Can you keep your thoughts to yourself. I don't enjoy having to listen to a humans sniveling love story.'_  
'你有时候真是没脑子。能不能把你的想法藏好？我可不想听一个人类的哭哭啼啼的爱情故事。'

Shinji's brain waves didn't even change at the sudden intrusion of the '_voice_,' as he had come to know it.  
对于这个突然闯入的'声音'，他已经习以为常，真嗣的大脑波纹甚至没有一丝变化。

'What are you doing here,' he thought?  
'你在这里做什么？'他心想。

'_Your mind was irritating me, so I told you to shut up. But what is this...another synchronization test?'_  
'你的思维让我烦躁，所以我让你闭嘴。但这是什么...又一个同步测试？'

'Something like that. I don't even know for sure myself...'  
'类似那样。我自己也不太确定...'

The voice was silent for a minute before Shinji heard a low murmur and then a mumble of, '_Ah...so thats what happened.'_  
声音沉默了一会儿，然后真嗣听到一声低语，接着是含糊的咕哝：'啊...原来如此。'

'What are you talking about?'  
“你在说什么？”

'_You. Finally awoke and all that. Couldn't keep your emotions in check I see. Well, I can see why they are curious about you, you are unique after all. A human with an angels powers, well, if they can harness that power...'_  
“你，终于醒了，还有那些情绪失控的表现。看来我明白他们为什么对你好奇了，毕竟你是独一无二的。一个人类拥有天使的力量，如果能掌握这种力量……”

'They want to harness my powers...why?'  
“他们想利用我的力量……为什么？”

'_Even you should be able to see that. A human that is able to project a corporeal-'_  
'即便是你，也应该能看出来。一个能够投射出实体化 AT 力场的人类——'

'Cor...what?' '实体...什么？'

'_It means that your AT-field has distinct form and shape, not the like the AT-field that all humans carry. Don't forget, if all humans were to lose there AT-fields they would technically become one, because a humans AT-field makes them unique and distinguishes them from all other humans. If AT-fields no longer exist, than all humans would be considered the same. I believe that this what your father considers as his version of Instrumentality.'_  
'这意味着你的 AT 力场具有明确的形式和形状，不像所有人携带的那种普通 AT 力场。别忘了，如果所有人类都失去了他们的 AT 力场，他们从技术上讲就会变成一个整体，因为人类的 AT 力场使他们独一无二，区别于其他所有人。如果 AT 力场不复存在，那么所有人类都将被视为相同。我相信这就是你父亲所认为的他版本的‘人类补完计划’。'

'My...father? Do you...know him? And what do you mean Instrumentality?'  
'我的...父亲？你...认识他吗？还有，你说的‘工具化’是什么意思？'

'_I do not know your father the way you do...lets just say that I have a reliable source that knows him well. Instrumentality...or Human Instrumentality is a plan that Seele plans to implement, though what it is...I'm not sure. Maybe they plan on becoming the gods of this world. Your fathers version differs significantly though. He wants to be rejoined with his loved one.'_  
'我并不像你那样了解你的父亲...这么说吧，我有一个可靠的消息来源，他对他非常了解。工具化...或者说人类工具化，是 Seele 计划实施的一个方案，虽然具体是什么...我不确定。也许他们打算成为这个世界的神。但你父亲的想法则大相径庭。他想要与心爱之人重新结合。'

'My mother?' '我的母亲？'

'_I did not say that...but yes. That is most likely correct.'_  
'我并没有那么说...但确实，那很可能是正确的。'

'And somehow I'm involved in all this?'  
'而我不知怎么地卷入了这一切？'

'_You could say that you are the key to it all.'_  
'可以这么说，你是解开这一切的关键。'

'Why am I a key-"  
'为什么我是一把钥匙-"

'_Because you are, simple as that. If you have to, curse the fact that you were brought into this world.'_  
'因为你就是，就这么简单。如果非要抱怨，那就怪你被带到这个世界上来吧。'

Something similar stirred in Shinji's mind, something that he had heard recently too.  
某种类似的念头在真嗣的脑海中涌动，那是他最近也听到过的。

"What do you-" "你这是-"

His entire mind surged forward and than backwards as though he had just suffered a mental whiplash. His head hurt like crazy. It felt like somebody had stabbed a white, hot poker on his skull, burning away the hair and flesh, leaving the brain scarred.  
他的整个思维猛地向前冲，随即又向后甩，仿佛刚刚遭受了一次精神上的鞭打。他的头疼痛欲裂，感觉像是有人将一根炽热的烙铁刺入他的头骨，烧焦了头发和皮肉，留下大脑的伤痕。

His eyes burst open suddenly and he immediately felt a stinging sensation on his right side. Looking down at his arm, he saw that from his finger tips to his elbow a bluish tinge had started to develop under his skin. Meanwhile, all around him the LCL fluid was boiling to the point that he felt he was being cooked in a pot roast. He heard frantic yelling over the intercom, but wasn't able to distinguish any of the voices. What he wouldn't give to just fade out of reality right now.  
他的眼睛突然睁开，立刻感到右侧一阵刺痛。低头看向手臂，他发现从指尖到肘部，皮肤下开始出现蓝紫色斑块。与此同时，周围的 LCL 液体沸腾到了他感觉自己像是在炖锅中被烹煮的程度。他听到对讲机里传来慌乱的喊叫声，却无法分辨任何声音。他多么希望此刻能从现实中消失。

Maybe he had just gotten his wish.  
或许他刚刚才实现了自己的愿望。

His entire body was disappearing.  
他的整个身体正在消失。

He gasped loudly as he watched the tips of his fingers slowly become transparent and then disappear all together. His entire body started to disintegrate into nothingness.  
他大声喘息着，眼看着指尖逐渐变得透明，最终完全消失。他的整个身体开始分解成虚无。

Meanwhile on the outside, Ritsuko was desperately trying to reverse the process, though with little luck. Unit 01 was not responding. Misato and Asuka were therefore forced to watch helplessly as Shinji slowly dissolved in front of there eyes.  
与此同时，在外界，律子正拼命试图逆转这一过程，但运气不佳。初号机毫无反应。因此，美里和明日香只能无助地看着真嗣在他们眼前慢慢消融。

For Shinji it didn't hurt, it just felt like he was, fading away with the wind. It didn't really seem so bad of an option really. He had sometimes wished he would just fade away with the wind, when he was particularly hurt by someone. Course he would be leaving behind his friends, but they could continue on without him. They would find somebody else to pilot Unit 01, or would he become one with Unit 01 and become another voice. Maybe that wouldn't be so bad. At least he could bother the next pilot till his...spirit or whatever passed on.  
对真嗣来说，这并不痛苦，只感觉自己像是在随风消逝。这其实并不算太糟糕的选择。有时，当被某人特别伤害时，他曾希望自己能随风消逝。当然，他会留下朋友们，但他们可以继续前行，没有他。他们会找到其他人来驾驶初号机，或者他会与初号机合为一体，成为另一个声音。也许那不会太糟糕。至少他可以烦扰下一位驾驶员，直到他的...灵魂或其他什么东西消散。

Everything faded to white.  
一切渐渐化为白色。

---

And so, he suspected his new life to start, though what he had expected was a lot different that what he was seeing. Where the hell was this anyway?  
于是，他怀疑新生活即将开始，尽管他所期待的与眼前所见大相径庭。这到底是什么鬼地方？

Everything was white. Left, right, up, down, no matter where he looked all he saw was white. Was this what the after life was supposed to be? A whitish place that went on forever with no end in sight. Or was this simply something that he was imagining.  
一切都是白色的。左看右看，上看下看，无论他望向何处，眼前尽是白色。难道这就是所谓的来世？一个无边无际、永无尽头的白色空间。还是说，这只是他脑海中的幻想。

"You're not imagining this," said a soft voice from behind him. "This is all very real...or as real as things in here can be."  
“你并非在幻想，”一个柔和的声音从他身后传来，“这一切都非常真实……或者说，在这里的事物所能达到的真实程度。”

Shinji turned slowly to the sound of the soft feminine voice.  
真嗣缓缓转身，循着那柔和的女性声音望去。

At first he thought he was looking at Rei, the similarities where eerie. She had dark brown hair that barely touched her shoulders. Her eyes were a soft brown that seemed closer to chocolate than anything  
起初他以为自己看到的是绫波，两人的相似之处令人毛骨悚然。她有着深棕色的头发，刚刚触及肩膀。她的眼睛是柔和的棕色，更接近巧克力色而非其他。

'My eyes,' Shinji reminded himself.  
'我的眼睛，' 真嗣提醒自己。

For he was looking at a mother that had died many years before, his mother.  
因为他正看着一位多年前就已去世的母亲，他的母亲。

Very hesitantly, Shinji opened his mouth, blinked twice and said, "Mother?"  
慎之介非常犹豫地张开嘴，眨了两次眼，说道：“母亲？”

She smiled back at him and nodded once before opening her arms to greet him.  
她微笑着回应他，点了点头，然后张开双臂迎接他。

The next few moments were lost to Shinji as he dashed forward and was brought into a comforting hug that he had never experienced, even in Asuka's tenderest moments. The hug of a mother was like nothing else, and you couldn't really blame him. He had never known who his mother was, or what she really looked like. Now though he saw the similarities which he had missed the first time. The shape of their noses, how theirs lips both seemed to draw upwards in the same way when they smiled. Shinji even recognized the simplest curve of the ears.  
接下来的几秒钟，真嗣仿佛迷失了自我，他向前冲去，被一个从未体验过的安慰拥抱所包围，即便是在明日香最温柔的时刻也未曾有过。母亲的拥抱是无与伦比的，你不能真的怪他。他从未知道自己的母亲是谁，或者她真正的模样。但现在，他看到了第一次错过的一些相似之处。他们的鼻子形状，他们的嘴唇在微笑时都以同样的方式上扬。真嗣甚至认出了耳朵最简单的曲线。

"Is this real?" He suddenly said. If it wasn't, he never wanted this dream to end.  
“这是真的吗？”他突然问道。如果不是，他永远不希望这个梦结束。

His mother, Yui chuckled softly and said, "I suppose it is. I never thought that this was possible."  
他的母亲，唯轻声笑道：“我想这是真的。我从没想过这有可能。”

"But what is this," said Shinji as he took a step back trying to tell if something had changed in his surroundings.  
"但这是什么，" 真嗣说着后退一步，试图判断周围是否有变化。

"Somewhere inside the Eva, I suppose."  
"我想是在 Eva 的某个内部吧。"

"You know about the Eva?"  
"你知道 Eva 的事？"

"Course, I helped design them."  
“当然，我参与了设计。”

"You did what?" “你做了什么？”

Yui smirked slightly before she said with a sigh, "Gendo didn't tell you much I suppose."  
Yui 微微一笑，叹了口气说：“Gendo 大概没告诉你多少吧。”

"He rarely tells me anything at all. He can be very stubborn," murmured Shinji.  
"他很少告诉我任何事情。他可以非常固执，" 真嗣低声说道。

"So I've known," she said with a slight frown. "Anyway I have no idea how long I'll be able to talk to but first I think I'll get some stuff out of the way. ...You must hate me Shinji..."  
"所以我已经知道了，" 她微微皱眉说道。"无论如何，我不知道还能和你聊多久，但首先我想把一些事情说清楚。...你一定恨我吧，真嗣..."

Shinji had to do double take at this. "What? How could I hate you?"  
真嗣对此不得不再次确认。"什么？我怎么会恨你？"

"...You mean...you don't?"  
"...你是说...你不？"

"Don't what?" "不什么？"

"Never mind...forget I said anything."  
"算了...当我没说。"

Shinji nodded and was silent for a minute. He had about a hundred questions to ask his mother, each he felt more time consuming than the last.  
真嗣点点头，沉默了一会儿。他有一百个问题想问他的母亲，每个问题都感觉比上一个更耗时。

"How am I here? Last I remember I was inside the Eva...disappearing."  
“我是怎么来到这里的？我记得最后我在 Eva 里面...消失。”

"I think your molecules were separated piece by piece. Most likely your entire genetic makeup is still floating in the sea of LCL fluid."  
“我想你的分子是被一片片分离的。很可能你的整个基因构成仍然漂浮在 LCL 溶液的海洋中。”

Shinji raised an eyebrow in confusion but said nothing. Even though he was the son of scientists, he was not good at science himself.  
真嗣困惑地挑了挑眉，却什么也没说。尽管他是科学家的儿子，自己却并不擅长科学。

There was an uncomfortable silence for a minute. What were they really supposed to talk about after never really talking to each other. Shinji didn't know where to begin.  
一阵尴尬的沉默持续了一分钟。他们从未真正交谈过，现在该谈些什么呢？真嗣不知道从何说起。

"How come you're here mom?" He suddenly blurted out.  
“妈妈，你怎么会在这里？”他突然脱口而出。

"Ah...I suppose you could call me something like Eva Unit 01's spirit."  
"啊...我想你可以称我为 Eva 初号机的灵魂。"

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

"You know that I died in an experiment, right."  
"你知道我在一次实验中死去，对吧。"

"Yes..." "是的..."

"The experiment was Unit 01's first activation. It went berserk and killed my human body, though I found that my spirit was able to reside in Unit 01. Since then I've stayed here. It's because I exist here that you are able to pilot it."  
“实验是零号机第一次启动。它暴走了，杀死了我的肉体，但我发现我的灵魂能够寄居在零号机中。从那时起，我就一直留在这里。正是因为我的存在，你才能驾驶它。”

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"The children after Second Impact are the only ones that are able to pilot the Eva's. But for them to be able to pilot them there has to be some spirit inhabiting them, someone that loves them. The same applies for the other Eva's, with the exception of Unit 00. Its nothing but an empty shell."  
“第二次冲击后的孩子们是唯一能驾驶 EVA 的人。但为了让他们能够驾驶，必须有某种灵魂寄居其中，有某个爱他们的人。其他 EVA 也是如此，除了零号机。它只是一个空壳。”

"What is resting in Unit 02?"  
"零二号机里躺着的是什么？"

"I don't know. That experiment happened after I had already passed on. You'd have to ask the pilot of the 02."  
"我不清楚。那次实验发生在我去世之后。你得去问零二号机的驾驶员。"

Shinji could just imagine that conversation with Asuka.  
真嗣几乎可以想象和明日香进行那场对话的情景。

"How are you doing though outside of piloting an Eva? School going okay? Grades fine? I hope you have plenty of friends."  
"除了驾驶 Eva 之外，你过得怎么样？学校还好吗？成绩怎么样？希望你有很多朋友。"

Shinji sighed as her motherly instincts kicked in. "I'm fine, better than I've been in a while really. I've got a guardian who looks after me and several friends."  
真嗣叹了口气，她的母性本能被激发了。“我很好，真的比之前一段时间好多了。我有一个监护人照顾我，还有几个朋友。”

"School?" "学校？"

"So-So," said Shinji holding back a smile.  
"一般般吧," 真嗣说着, 忍住笑意。

"Well as long as you pass I suppose I'll be happy. Now you should probably return to your own place."  
"好吧, 只要你及格, 我想我会很高兴的。现在你或许应该回你自己那儿去了。"

"No. I want to talk with you more."  
"不, 我想和你多聊聊。"

Shaking her head, Yui said, "You don't belong here. As much as I want to continue talking to you, I know that this place isn't for you. You have people on the outside that are worried about you. One in particular seems to be infuriated by your absence.  
"摇了摇头，Yui 说道，“你不属于这里。尽管我希望能继续与你交谈，但我知道这个地方并不适合你。外面有人担心你，尤其是有一位似乎对你的缺席感到愤怒。”

Shinji could only guess who that was.  
Shinji 只能猜测那人是谁。

"I want to ask you something before I left."  
“在我离开之前，我想问你一件事。”

"Better make it quick." “最好快点搞定。”

"Okay...do you know if another spirit is residing in here, because I here...voices sometimes when I'm piloting the Eva."  
“好吧……你知道这里是不是还住着另一个灵魂吗？因为我驾驶 Eva 的时候……偶尔会听到一些声音。”

Yui's eyes narrowed. "I think I know what you mean. Sometimes my existence is pushed aside, it feels strange. That could be what you are talking about. But it never stays around for long, its always constantly moving. Sometimes I feel it, sometimes I don't. I would be wary of it though. There is strong malice coming from what I've felt before."  
“绫波的眼睛眯了起来。“我想我知道你的意思。有时候我的存在会被挤到一边，感觉很奇怪。那可能就是你说的那种情况。但它从不会停留太久，总是不停地移动。有时候我能感觉到，有时候又感觉不到。不过我得提醒你，我从之前感受到的气息中察觉到了强烈的恶意。”

"I'll keep that in mind. Thank you mom...for everything."  
"我会记住的。谢谢妈妈……为了所有的一切。"

"I don't see why you should be thanking me. If anything...you should be...well, I suppose you should be on your way. Best not keep the others waiting too much longer. It looks as though they might forcefully try to get you out."  
"我不明白你为什么要谢我。如果有什么的话……你应该……嗯，我想你应该上路了。最好不要让其他人等太久。看起来他们可能会强行把你弄出去。"

Shinji snorted. If it was Asuka decision she'd crack open the entry plug and search for him herself.  
真嗣哼了一声。如果是明日香的决定，她会打开插入栓亲自去找他。

Smirking slightly, he noticed his body become transparent, and waved a finally farewell to his mother before he reappeared inside the entry plug.  
他微微冷笑，注意到自己的身体变得透明，向母亲挥了最后一下手告别，随后便出现在驾驶舱内。

---

Everything was a blur as he reappeared. He felt many arms grabbing and touching him as he was forcefully hauled out of the entry plug. Suddenly he felt a sharp metal object pierce his skin before he was fully conscious and saw the syringe release the chemical into his body. First thing out of the entry plug and they were already afraid of him. He thought this silently as he slowly passed out.  
当他再次出现时，一切都模糊不清。他感到许多手臂抓住并触摸着他，被强行从驾驶舱中拖出。突然间，他感到一个尖锐的金属物体刺入皮肤，在他完全清醒之前，看到针筒将化学物质注入体内。刚出驾驶舱，他们就已经害怕他了。他默默地想着，渐渐失去了意识。

---

Wow his body was numb. Every nerve in his body felt split and frayed. All his senses were completely switched off. What in the world had happened?  
哇，他的身体完全麻木了。每一根神经都像是被撕裂和磨损。所有的感官都彻底关闭了。到底发生了什么？

He had apparently spoken this out loud, because he got a returning answer.  
他显然是不小心把这话说了出来，因为随即就得到了一个回应。

"A lot of stuff really, you're okay though...baka."  
“真的很多事，不过你还好……笨蛋。”

His hearing wasn't apparently completely gone as he could easily tell who this was by the tone of there voice.  
他的听力显然还没有完全丧失，仅凭对方的语调就能轻易判断出是谁。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"Yeah, I'm here." "是啊，我在这儿。"

"To bad I can't see you."  
"可惜我看不见你。"

"Which is a relief for me because I look terrible."  
"对我来说倒是件好事，因为我现在看起来糟透了。"

"I didn't think that was possible."  
"我没想到那可能。"

Asuka's breath hitched slightly but she said, "You really are an idiot."  
明日香的呼吸微微一滞，但她还是说："你真是个白痴。"

"Maybe I am..." "也许我是吧..."

Shinji suddenly felt something soft grasp his hand which was laying lifeless next to the bed.  
真嗣突然感觉到一只柔软的手握住了他那只无力地躺在床边的手。

"That you?" “是你吗？”

"...No one else is in here."  
“……这里没有别人。”

"Sorry, I can't feel your hand very well is all."  
"抱歉，我只是感觉不到你的手。"

"With good reason. Your arms look as though you're a heroin addict. I can't believe how many drugs they pumped into you. They only stopped after Misato yelled at them."  
"这很正常。你的手臂看起来就像个海洛因成瘾者。真不敢相信他们给你注射了多少药物。直到美里对他们大吼，他们才停下来。"

"Glad that she's on my side."  
"很高兴她站在我这边。"

"Yeah, me too." "是啊，我也是。"

They were silent for a minute, just glad to be near each other once again. Though both knew that this was a very temporary thing. There time apart might be longer this time.  
他们沉默了一会儿，只是很高兴能再次靠近彼此。尽管两人都知道这非常短暂。这次分开的时间可能会更长。

"Sorry that I took so long to get here," said Asuka suddenly.  
"抱歉，我花了这么久才来到这里，" 明日香突然说道。

"Don't blame yourself, I'm sure you tried your best. Not that it would have mattered much since I was out until today though."  
"别自责了，我相信你已经尽力了。不过，既然我今天才回来，那也没太大关系。"

"Yeah, I suppose." "是啊，我想是的。"

"How long do you have to stay?"  
"你还要待多久？"

"Not much longer...I was given a few minutes thanks to Misato."  
"不会太久了...多亏了美里，我被允许有几分钟时间。"

"I'll have to thank her when I get the chance."  
"有机会我得谢谢她。"

"Hmm," said Asuka nodding her consent.  
"嗯，" 明日香点头表示同意。"

Letting out a low sigh, Shinji turned towards the sound of Asuka's voice. He thought he even saw the outline of her face. But maybe that was just his mind playing tricks on itself.  
叹了口气，真嗣转向明日香声音的方向。他觉得自己甚至看到了她的脸庞轮廓。但也许那只是他的大脑在捉弄自己。

"How you faring...by yourself I mean?"  
"你一个人过得怎么样？"

Shrugging Asuka said, "Okay...nights or kinda rough. Hikari has been helping me a little. Even Kensuke and Touji have been kinder than usually."  
明日香耸耸肩说："还行吧...晚上有点难熬。光最近帮了我一些。就连真治和阿薰也比平时更体贴了。"

"Good, or I'd have to get angry with them."  
"那就好，不然我可要对他们发火了。"

"Thats not a good idea."  
"那不是个好主意。"

Shinji laughed silently, "No, I suppose that wouldn't be."  
真嗣默默地笑了，"不，我想那不会是。"

"I'm just glad that you're still the same. I had worried that you might have...changed."  
"我只是很高兴你还是老样子。我曾担心你可能会……变了。"

"Didn't I tell you I'd stay the same person that you knew?"  
"我不是告诉过你，我会是你认识的那个人吗？"

"Yes...but you can't blame me for being worried."  
"是的...但你不能怪我担心。"

"No...I supposed I can't."  
"不...我想我不能。"

The door opened and Shinji heard Misato's voice.  
门开了，真嗣听到了美里小姐的声音。

"Asuka...time to go." "明日香...该走了。"

"...M'kay," she mumbled silently.  
"...好吧，"她小声嘟囔着。"

Shinji squeezed Asuka's hand briefly before letting it slide out of his grasp, waved in the direction that he thought the two of them were, and laid back down in his bed.  
真嗣短暂地握了一下明日香的手，然后任由它从自己的掌握中滑落，朝着他认为两人所在的方向挥了挥手，又躺回了床上。

A short time later, Ritsuko returned with another sinister looking syringe, bringing Shinji into a dreamless sleep.  
不久后，律子带着另一支看起来不祥的注射器回来了，让真嗣陷入了无梦的睡眠。

### Chapter 14: Despair
第十四章：绝望

**Okay so yeah this is a day late. Maybe its better if I do this on Christmas though...eh whatever. As I post this chapter it has literally been (counts off on fingers) twelve hours since I started working on this. As for my one shot...its done and all, but needs to be proofread. So that wont be out till sometime later today. And for ever body that wanted a lemon you got your wish. Anyway I'm gonna go to sleep now and wake up in the next four hours.  
好吧，是的，这章晚了一天。也许在圣诞节做这个更好……呃，无所谓了。当我发布这一章时，实际上从我开始工作到现在已经（数着手指）十二个小时了。至于我的短篇……已经完成了，但需要校对。所以今天晚些时候才会发布。而对于那些想要柠檬（暗示色情内容）的读者，你们如愿以偿了。无论如何，我现在要去睡觉了，四个小时后醒来。**

---

Shinji wasn't sure how long he had been sleeping, but it didn't feel like a full day, in fact, it felt like only a few hours had gone by since his visit with Asuka. At least they had decided to let him sleep on a bed this time instead of an operating table.  
真嗣不确定自己睡了多久，但这感觉不像是一整天，实际上，自从他和明日香见面后，感觉只过了几个小时。至少这次他们决定让他睡在床上，而不是手术台上。

He was in his usual white room, though it might not have been the usual, since he suspected that there was more then just one. Looking down at his arms, he didn't seen any cords or wires, just the scars from when he received the glass shards.  
他身处他那惯常的白色房间，尽管这可能已非往常，因为他怀疑不止一个这样的房间。低头看着自己的手臂，他没有看到任何线缆或电线，只有那些因玻璃碎片而留下的伤疤。

Swinging his leg over the side of his bed, he was determined to get out of this depressing room and find something to eat, when the door slid open and Ritsuko walked in.  
他跨过床沿，决心离开这个令人沮丧的房间，找点东西吃，就在这时，门滑开了，律子走了进来。

"...Shinji?" "...真嗣？"

"I'm not doing anything wrong, so you don't have to act so defensive. I was just thinking of looking for some food."  
“我没有做错什么，所以你不必这么戒备。我只是想去找点吃的。”

"Oh..right. Well, before that, I was hoping you could accompany me on a tour of some sorts."  
"哦...对。那么，在那之前，我希望你能陪我参观一下这里。"

"I really don't care to see more of Nerv then I already have."  
"我实在不想再看更多关于 NERV 的东西了。"

"I'm sure you will be interested in this particular thing."  
"我相信你会对这个特别的东西感兴趣的。"

Shinji stood, staring at Ritsuko before sighing in resignation, he said, "Lead the way."  
真嗣站着，盯着律子，然后叹了口气，无奈地说：“带路吧。”

---

Shinji had certainly never been this far down into Nerv headquarters, he thought as the elevator they were on continued to descend deep into Central Dogma.  
真嗣确信自己从未深入过 NERV 总部这么远，他想着，随着他们所在的电梯继续向中央教条深处下降。

After passing the thirty-third floor, Shinji was becoming suspicious.  
过了第三十三层后，真嗣开始起了疑心。

"What exactly is down here?" He asked with a slight edge in his voice.  
"这里到底有什么？" 他的声音中带着一丝尖锐。

"...Something that I figured was worth while for you to see."  
"……我觉得你值得一看的东西。"

"Does my father know about this?"  
"我父亲知道这件事吗？"

Ritsuko hesitated for a second before she finally said, "No, the commander does not know that I am bringing you here, though he does know about this dark secret kept at Nerv."  
赤木律子犹豫了一会儿，最终说道：“不，指挥官并不知道我带你来这里，尽管他确实知道 NERV 隐藏的这个黑暗秘密。”

"Who all knows about this besides yourself?"  
“除了你之外，还有谁知道这件事？”

"The commander and vice commander."  
“指挥官和副指挥官。”

"Misato doesn't?" "美里不知道吗？"

"...She suspects, but her clearance isn't high enough to get her down here."  
"……她有所怀疑，但她的权限不够，无法让她来到这里。"

Shinji felt slightly fearful suddenly. What could be so bad that they had to keep it away from even Misato?  
真嗣突然感到一阵恐惧。究竟是什么事情严重到连美里都要瞒着？

As the lift came to a sudden jolting halt, the rot-iron gates slowly opened, and Shinji stepped out into a wide opened room.  
当电梯突然猛地停下，锈迹斑斑的铁门缓缓打开，真嗣踏入了一个宽敞的房间。

After taking several looks around, Shinji realized what he was looking and said, "This is-"  
环顾四周几眼后，真嗣意识到他所见之物，说道：“这里是——”

"The failed attempts at creating the first Evangelion."  
“初号机制造失败的尝试。”

Giant pits opened up in the Earth, in which the failed corpses of previous Evangelion lay there, slowly decomposing. Barely any flesh was left on the disfigured bones of the bodies and Shinji suddenly felt sick. Hardly anything was left except for the bones, which consisted largely of the skull and the backbone and several limbs which seemed to be some sort of strange mutation.  
大地上裂开了巨大的坑洞，里面躺着先前失败的 EVA 残骸，正缓慢地腐烂。扭曲的骨架上几乎不剩什么肉了，只剩下骨头，主要是头骨、脊椎和几根看似某种奇怪变异的肢体。真嗣突然感到一阵恶心。除了这些骨头，几乎什么都没剩下。

"This is awful," mumbled Shinji.  
“这太可怕了，”真嗣喃喃自语。

"This is the reality of what has transpired here. Some might consider what we conducted an atrocity, we consider it as a scientific breakthrough."  
“这就是这里发生的事实。有些人可能认为我们所做的是一种暴行，而我们则视之为科学上的突破。”

"But the Eva's are still organisms. They must have...some sort of feelings."  
"但 Eva 仍然是生物体。它们一定有...某种感觉。"

"Irrelevant. The Evangelions were derived from Adam, the first angel, they are nothing more then our tools."  
"无关紧要。Eva 是从第一个使徒亚当衍生而来的，它们不过是我们的工具罢了。"

"Then what about the souls of the people that reside in them?"  
"那住在它们体内的人们的灵魂呢？"

Ritsuko froze for a second, momentarily surprised that he knew about something so sensitive as that.  
律子愣了一瞬，没想到他竟然知道如此敏感的事情。

"Where did you hear that?"  
“你从哪儿听说的？”

"Doesn't matter...people's souls are inside of those things."  
“无所谓了……那些东西里面装着人们的灵魂。”

"Dead people's souls," Ritsuko reminded him.  
"死者的灵魂，" 律子提醒他。

"Are we just supposed to forget about them?"  
"我们就该把他们忘了吗？"

"Some things are better left forgotten," said Ritsuko, ending the conversation and continuing forward.  
"有些事，忘了反而更好，" 律子结束了对话，继续前行。

Shinji grumbled silently as he trailed behind her, trying to ignore the corpses on either side of him.  
真嗣默默地抱怨着，跟在她身后，试图忽视两侧的尸体。

Eventually the wide room filled with the corpses of past Eva's came to an end and they stopped outside a door. Swiping her key card through the slot, Ritsuko punched in several numbers, and the door swung open to admit her.  
最终，布满过往 EVA 尸体的宽敞房间走到了尽头，她们停在了一扇门外。律子用钥匙卡刷过插槽，输入了几位数字，门便应声而开，让她进入。

They were in a high ceilinged room now that seemed to stretch upward forever. As Shinji took a step forward he looked to his left and right, noticing the small island in the middle while a watery substance seemed to be surrounding it.  
现在他们身处一个高耸的房间，天花板似乎直通天际。真嗣向前迈了一步，左右环顾，注意到中间的小岛被一种水状物质环绕着。

"What is this place?" “这是什么地方？”

Taking several steps forward, Ritsuko said, "This is what is known as the Black Moon, the resting place of the second angel, Lilith."  
向前走了几步，律子说道：“这就是所谓的黑月，第二使徒莉莉丝的安息之地。”

As Shinji heard her words, what was nailed to a cross in the center of the island soon became apparent. It looked like a white, faceless, legless giant, with a mask over what looked like an upside down triangle, with seven opened eyes adorning it. Where a stomach should have been, the skin was disfigured, with large bulges popping out of the side. Shinji then realized that a fluid seemed to be leaking from this apparent wound.  
听到她的话，真嗣很快意识到岛上中央被钉在十字架上的东西是什么。它看起来像一个白色、无脸、无腿的巨人，戴着一副面具，形状像倒三角形，上面有七只睁开的眼睛。本该是腹部的地方，皮肤畸形，侧面鼓起大包。真嗣随后意识到，似乎有液体从这个明显的伤口中渗出。

"This is an angel?" "这是个天使？"

"Correct," Ritsuko replied.  
"没错，" 律子回答道。"

"But what is it doing here?"  
"但它在这里做什么？"

"Lilith was found buried underneath Japan. The Geofront was build upon it and Nerv created an entire city to hide its existence from the public. The fluid that you see leaking from its chest cavity, is in fact LCL fluid, the same that we use to supply the Evangelions."  
"莉莉丝被发现埋藏在日本地下。地底空洞就是建在其上方，而 NERV 为了隐藏其存在，建造了整个第三新东京市。你们看到的从它胸腔渗出的液体，实际上是 LCL 液体，与我们供给 EVA 的相同。"

"But why here?" "但为什么选在这里？"

"Tokyo-3 is the safest and possibly dangerous place on Earth right now. The reason the angels appear here is because of Lilith, they are drawn to its presence, but we have three Evangelions here, which makes us more then prepared enough."  
"第三新东京市是目前地球上最安全也可能是最危险的地方。使徒出现在这里是因为莉莉丝，它们被其存在所吸引，但我们这里有三个 EVA，这让我们准备充分。"

As Shinji continued to look up into the eerie face of Lilith he asked, "Why are you showing me this?"  
当真嗣继续抬头凝视着莉莉丝那诡异的面孔时，他问道：“你为什么要让我看到这些？”

Shrugging, Ritsuko said, "For my own purposes, and I believe you deserve to know after everything that you have been put through. I'm sorry about the whole confinement, but there really is nothing I can do."  
理津子耸了耸肩，说道：“出于我自己的目的，而且我认为在经历了这一切之后，你有权知道真相。对于整个监禁的事情，我很抱歉，但我真的无能为力。”

"Yeah, I know," he mumbled.  
“嗯，我知道。”他咕哝道。

They stood there for a while longer looking at the soulless face of Lilith.  
他们又在那里站了一会儿，凝视着莉莉丝那毫无生气的面孔。

"I have something else that I wanted to tell you while we're down here, which is probably the main reason why I brought you down here. Try not to get...agitated as I know you probably will be furious."  
“我还有件事想在我们在下面的时候告诉你，这大概也是我带你下来的主要原因。尽量别……激动，我知道你可能会非常愤怒。”

"...What is it?" “……什么事？”

"After a failed experiment The United States of America has relinquished its grip on Eva Unit-03; they have decided to send it to us. Due to the writings of the Vatican Treaty each country is allowed to have a maximum number of three Evangelion at any given time, this limits the country in questions power. Because we will be gaining control of Unit-03, the commander has deemed it necessary to place Unit-01 in storage."  
"在一次失败的实验后，美利坚合众国放弃了 Eva 三号机的控制权；他们决定将其移交给我们。根据梵蒂冈条约的规定，每个国家在任何时候最多只能拥有三台 Eva，这限制了相关国家的力量。由于我们将接管三号机，指挥官认为有必要将初号机封存。"

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"...Honestly, we don't know how your powers will be affected during actual combat, and furthermore you may pose a threat to the other pilots."  
"...老实说，我们不知道你的能力在实战中会受到怎样的影响，而且你可能会对其他驾驶员构成威胁。"

"Why did you expect me to get angry? Its not like I care that much to begin with."  
"你为什么期待我会生气？我本来就没那么在意。"

"I'm...not quite done. The original pilot for the synchronization was supposed to be you, but after that last test, the commander decided to have Asuka pilot it."  
"我...还没完全准备好。原本同步测试的驾驶员应该是你，但在上次测试后，指挥官决定让明日香来驾驶。"

Shinji could feel the ringing settle in his ears almost immediately after she spoke.  
真嗣几乎在她说话的同时就感觉到耳中响起了嗡鸣声。

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"Shinji...you promised you would't get angry."  
"真嗣...你答应过不会生气的。"

"...How could I not be angry! Does my father want me to break his fucking neck?"  
"...我怎么能不生气！我父亲是想让我扭断他那该死的脖子吗？"

Ritsuko could feel the change in his aura and his anger boil over to the point where she felt something constricting her trachea.  
律子能感觉到他气场中的变化，他的愤怒沸腾到了让她感到气管被勒紧的程度。

"...Shinji!" "...真嗣！"

At her sudden scornful words, Shinji's shoulders relaxed slightly, passing a hand over his head, he wiped the sweat off his brow and glanced in the direction of Lilith. For some reason he felt a presence that felt oddly familiar.  
听到她突如其来的嘲讽，真嗣的肩膀微微放松，他用手抹过头顶，擦去额头的汗水，并朝莉莉丝的方向瞥了一眼。不知为何，他感觉到一种异常熟悉的气息。

Shaking off the feeling of deja vu, he looked over at Ritsuko and said, "Sorry...when is the test supposed to take place?"  
他甩开那种似曾相识的感觉，转向赤木律子问道：“抱歉……测试预计什么时候进行？”

"Tomorrow at noon." “明天中午。”

"Am I allowed to be there?"  
"我可以去那里吗？"

"...No. You weren't even supposed to know about this."  
"……不行。你甚至不应该知道这件事。"

"Right," said Shinji moodily. Turning around he walked past Ritsuko, and towards the lift to take him back up to the surface.  
"好吧，" 真嗣心情不佳地说道。他转身走过律子，朝电梯走去，准备返回地面。

Asuka got the news that she would be the test pilot for Unit 03 later that day, and she wasn't entirely thrilled. She was afraid that her synchronization rate would have dropped dramatically; she had been reliving the rape every night, except that Shinji didn't rescue her. Her eyes were bloodshot now and she had black bags under her eyes from the lack of sleep.  
明日香得知当天晚些时候她将成为 03 机体的测试驾驶员，这消息并未让她完全兴奋。她担心自己的同步率会急剧下降；每晚她都在重复经历那场强奸，只是这次真嗣没有来救她。她的眼睛布满血丝，因缺乏睡眠眼下出现了黑眼圈。

Resting her head on the couch, she buried her face in a pillow and thought about what she had been told by Misato.  
她将头靠在沙发上，把脸埋进枕头里，回想着美里告诉她的事情。

She knew that Shinji had been the original test pilot for Unit 03, but something had changed and she had been chosen.  
她知道真嗣原本是 03 机体的测试驾驶员，但情况发生了变化，她被选中了。

Rolling onto her back, she bit her lip in frustration at what she was supposed to do tomorrow. She was afraid that she would have a mental breakdown.  
她翻身仰躺，咬着嘴唇对明天该做的事感到沮丧。她担心自己会精神崩溃。

"Asuka?" Came a sudden voice from the doorway of the living room.  
“明日香？”客厅门口突然传来一个声音。

Asuka looked up to see Misato leaning against the door frame, with a frown creasing her brow.  
明日香抬头一看，只见美里靠在门框上，眉头紧皱。

"You okay with this," she asked.  
"你还好吧？" 她问道。

Asuka simply nodded and said, "Yeah...its fine. Its better for Shinji this way."  
明日香只是点点头，说："嗯...这样挺好的。对真嗣来说更好。"

"I could ask the commander to reevaluated his deci-"  
"我可以请求指挥官重新评估他的决定——"

"Its fine," she said in a much sterner voice.  
"没事的，"她用更加严厉的语气说道。

"Asuka...if you need to talk to me about anything you know-"  
"明日香...如果你需要和我谈什么，你知道的-"

"I'm perfectly fine," shouted Asuka. Throwing herself off the couch, she stormed passed Misato before slamming the door of her room, only to have it bounce back and rebound against the opposite wall.  
"我完全没事，"明日香大喊道。她从沙发上跳起来，怒气冲冲地从美里身边走过，猛地摔上自己房间的门，结果门又弹了回来，反弹到对面的墙上。

Flattening herself against her futon, she crushed her face against the pillow as silent tears started streaming down her face.  
她紧贴着榻榻米躺下，将脸埋进枕头里，无声的泪水开始顺着脸颊流淌。

When was this nightmare going to end?  
这场噩梦何时才能结束？

---

Asuka woke early the next morning, and hurriedly dressed to prepare to leave for Nerv. Even if she didn't want to admit it, she was extremely nervous.  
明日香第二天一早就醒了，急忙穿上衣服准备前往 NERV。尽管她不愿承认，但她感到极度紧张。

Going down the highway leading to the testing site, Asuka constantly bit her already chapped lips, and curled a loose strand of her hair around her index finger. She was constantly looking out the window, trying to judge if they were any closer.  
沿着通往测试场的高速公路行驶，明日香不停地咬着她那已经干裂的嘴唇，并用食指卷起一缕松散的头发。她不断地望向窗外，试图判断他们是否更接近目的地了。

Leaning against the window, with her chin resting in the palm of her hand she asked Misato, "Is Shinji going to be there?"  
她斜靠在车窗上，下巴搁在手掌中，问美里：“真嗣会在那里吗？”

Misato glanced over at Asuka for a second before saying, "No...he wont be. He doesn't even know about today, or the fact that he was chosen as the original pilot. You can at least understand what he would do if he learned that you were taking his place."  
美里瞥了明日香一眼，然后说：“不……他不会在。他甚至不知道今天的事，也不知道他被选为最初的驾驶员。你至少能理解，如果他得知你代替了他的位置，他会怎么做。”

"Yeah, he can be rather stubborn," mumbled Asuka.  
“是啊，他有时候挺固执的，”明日香咕哝道。

Pulling up to the contained area where the tests were supposed to be conducted, they both handed their pass cards over to security, before being sent onward.  
他们驶入测试区域，将通行卡递交给安保人员，随后被放行继续前进。

Stopping at a fork in the road, Misato waved Asuka onward while she entered a nearby tent where the monitoring equipment was being held.  
在岔路口停下，美里示意明日香继续前行，而她自己则走进了附近的帐篷，那里摆放着监控设备。

As Misato opened the flap of the tent, Ritsuko was just about to leave it. Passing by each other for a brief instance, Ritsuko whispered a few hasty words to Misato. "I told him. He seemed to appreciate it."  
当美里掀开帐篷的帘子时，律子正要离开。两人短暂地擦肩而过，律子匆匆对美里低语了几句。“我告诉他了。他似乎很感激。”

Misato gave no sign that she had heard Ritsuko's words, but was glad that she had at least listened to her request. She didn't care how she had done it, as long as Shinji was aware of what was happening she felt less guilty for putting Asuka through this.  
美里没有任何迹象表明她听到了律子的话，但她很高兴律子至少听从了她的请求。她不在乎律子是如何做到的，只要真嗣知道正在发生的事情，她对让明日香经历这一切的愧疚感就减轻了一些。

Asuka meanwhile had already changed into her plug suit and was climbing the ladder to the entry plug of Unit 03. It felt so much different, quite unlike the warmth that she was so used to while inside her own Eva. It was the first time that she felt that the Evangelion's were wrong, an abomination. She felt revolted that she was sitting inside of something that just felt so...evil."  
与此同时，明日香已经换上了插入栓服，正爬上三号机的插入栓梯子。这种感觉与她习惯的温暖截然不同。这是她第一次觉得使徒是错误的，是一种亵渎。她感到厌恶，自己竟然坐在这样一个感觉如此……邪恶的东西里面。

"Asuka...can you here me?"  
"明日香...你能听到我说话吗？"

"Perfectly fine," replied Asuka to Misato's question.  
"完全没问题，" 明日香回答了美里的话。"

"How do you feel?" "你感觉怎么样？"

Asuka hoped that Misato didn't notice the waver in her voice as she said, "Fine..."  
明日香希望美里没有注意到她声音中的颤抖，当她说：“好吧……”

"Okay. We're going to start the first phase. Just perform as you usually do in your synchronization tests and everything will be fine."  
“好的。我们将开始第一阶段。就像你在同步测试中通常做的那样表现，一切都会顺利的。”

"Right," said Asuka as she took a deep breath.  
“明白，”明日香说着深吸了一口气。

"LCL pressure at normal level, plug depth within acceptable parameters, pilot pulse and brain wave normal. Synchronization holding at seventy-four precent. No abnormalities detected."  
"LCL 压力正常，插头深度在可接受范围内，驾驶员脉搏和脑波正常。同步率保持在七十四百分比。未检测到异常。"

"Good," said Ritsuko as she ducked into the tent, standing beside Misato. "Proceed to the second stage of the test."  
"很好，" 律子一边说着一边弯腰进入帐篷，站在美里旁边。"进行测试的第二阶段。"

Asuka nodded and closed her eyes.  
明日香点了点头，闭上了眼睛。

She had done this over a thousand times, and in so many different scenarios, that she felt confident saying she could sync with an Eva while in a coma. Yet she had never found it so difficult as she did now. Maybe it was like she had thought before, the feel of the Eva was completely off. She didn't feel safe in here, she felt scared and afraid, and more then ever, she wanted Shinji to be with her, at possibly the most painful moments of her life.  
她已经这样做过上千次，在如此多的不同情境下，以至于她自信地说，即使在昏迷中也能与 Eva 同步。然而，她从未觉得像现在这样困难。也许就像她之前想的那样，Eva 的感觉完全不对劲。她在这里没有感到安全，她感到害怕和恐惧，而且比以往任何时候都更希望真嗣能陪在她身边，在她生命中最痛苦的时刻。

They said some women never overcame the trauma that was inflicted on them by a rape, Asuka could very well be leaning towards that. She had lied to Shinji about receiving help from Hikari; she had lied about Touji and Kensuke being nicer to her, because when she wasn't crying her eyes out on her pillow, she was aimlessly wandering around Tokyo-3. This usually happened while she was supposed to be in school, and amazingly, it was even starting to affect her grades.  
有人说，有些女性永远无法克服被强奸带来的创伤，明日香很可能正朝着这个方向发展。她对真嗣撒了谎，说自己从美里那里得到了帮助；她撒谎说剑介和薰对她更友好了，因为当她不在枕头上哭得眼睛红肿时，她就在第三新东京市漫无目的地游荡。这通常发生在她应该在学校的时候，而且令人惊讶的是，这甚至开始影响她的成绩。

She tried to imagine herself inside her own Eva, curled up in a ball and floating in the sea of LCL fluid, but even this wasn't enough to make he feel safe and protected. It seemed only one thing could do that, and that one thing was gone.  
她试图想象自己置身于自己的 Eva 中，蜷缩成一团，漂浮在 LCL 溶液的海洋里，但即便如此，也不足以让她感到安全和受到保护。似乎只有一件事能做到这一点，而那一件事已经消失了。

...She heard a voice...softly beckoning to her. Eyes opening slowly, she felt a shift in the LCL fluid, and thought she heard a voice whispering softly into her ear. Turning her head both left and right she didn't see anything, but she kept on hearing a voice calling to her.  
...她听到一个声音...温柔地召唤着她。眼睛缓缓睁开，她感觉到 LCL 液体的变化，仿佛听到耳边有声音轻柔地低语。她左右转动头部，却什么也没看见，但那个呼唤她的声音依旧持续着。

"_We can help you. You have nothing to fear with us here."_  
“我们能帮你。有我们在，你无需害怕。”

She suddenly felt as though she was being propelled down a long tunnel, with no end in sight. The tunnel walls on either side of her were a dark red, and the blackness that started to squeeze all around her was almost to much to bear.  
她突然感觉自己仿佛被推进了一条长长的隧道，前方看不到尽头。隧道两侧的墙壁是暗红色的，四周开始挤压过来的黑暗几乎让她难以承受。

A hand suddenly reached out from the darkness and beckoned to her. Asuka who was at her wits end, grasped it without thinking, and felt herself pulled roughly through the far corners of her mind.  
一只手突然从黑暗中伸出，向她招手。处于崩溃边缘的明日香，不假思索地抓住了它，随即感到自己被粗暴地拖过心灵的遥远角落。

Deeper blackness engulfed her, such that it seemed as though the light of the universe had suddenly gone out. She groped around frantically in the dark, trying to find any substantial object that she could latch onto and claim as her own safe haven. Eventually she tripped over her feet, falling flat on her face. She wrapped her arms around her head and willed herself to wake up, Surely this was all just a terrible dream that she was having, right? She was sleeping and she was going to wake up any second and laugh it off, right?"  
更深的黑暗吞噬了她，仿佛宇宙的光芒突然熄灭。她在黑暗中疯狂摸索，试图找到任何可以抓住的坚实物体，作为自己的避风港。最终她绊倒了，脸朝下摔倒在地。她用双臂抱住头，努力让自己醒来，这肯定只是一个可怕的梦，对吧？她在睡觉，随时都会醒来，然后一笑置之，对吧？

A white hand appeared out of the blackness, and grasped her hand pulled her towards its owner. Asuka went freely, as the light was better than anything the darkness could hold. Though as the owner of the hands face came into stronger perspective, Asuka's eyes widened as her mouth opened in a silent scream. A pure whitish face greeted her, with a lopsided red smile. The edges of its body were blurred and fuzzy, and it seemed to have a human shaped body.  
一只白皙的手从黑暗中出现，抓住她的手将她拉向其主人。明日香毫不犹豫地跟随着，因为光明胜过黑暗所能拥有的一切。然而，当那双手主人的面容更加清晰时，明日香瞪大了眼睛，张嘴无声地尖叫。一张纯白色的脸迎接着她，带着歪斜的红色微笑。它的身体边缘模糊不清，似乎有着人形的轮廓。

Asuka's silent scream had resounded loud inside the entry plug of the Eva, as the plug depth suddenly shot above one hundred.  
明日香无声的尖叫在 Eva 的插入栓内回荡，随着插入深度突然飙升至一百以上。

"What's going on, Asuka!" Shouted Misato into the intercom.  
“怎么回事，明日香！”美里对着对讲机大喊。

Asuka had been completely silent for ten seconds before she suddenly let out her high pitched screech.  
明日香沉默了整整十秒，随后突然爆发出她那尖锐的叫声。

"Plug Depth exceeding one hundred. The Pilot is in danger of mental contamination."  
"插入深度超过一百。驾驶员面临精神污染的危险。"

"Cut the synchronization between the pilot and the Eva!"  
"切断驾驶员与 Eva 之间的同步！"

"The Eva is not registering the code."  
"Eva 未响应代码。"

"Pilots brain waves are going sporadic, heart rate is accelerating rapidly."  
"驾驶员的脑波变得不稳定，心率正在迅速加快。"

"Misato!" "美里！"

Nodding at Ritsuko's quick question, Misato said, "Disengage test. Forcefully eject the entry plug out of the Eva, and remove the umbilical cord."  
美里对律子迅速提出的问题点头回应，说道：“解除测试。强行弹出插入栓，并切断脐带电缆。”

"...Eva is rejecting both of the signatures."  
"...伊娃正在拒绝这两份签名。"

"What the hell is going on-"  
"这到底是怎么回事-"

"...Ma'am I have a confirmation of pattern blue."  
"...女士，我确认了蓝色模式。"

"What?" "什么？"

"Unit 03 is being contaminated by an angel."  
"初号机正受到使徒的污染。"

"Try ejecting the plug again damn it."  
"再试一次，该死的，弹出插入栓。"

"Unable to, a glue like substance has coated itself around the entry plug making it impossible to eject."  
"无法做到，一种类似胶状的物质覆盖了插入栓入口，使其无法弹出。"

"Sudden heat source detected. Thermal energies rising. Unit 03 is breaking apart from the constraints."  
"检测到突发热源。热能正在上升。03 号单位正从束缚中解体。"

"Damn it, send a call to central command!"  
"该死，向中央指挥部发出呼叫！"

"...What should I-" "...我该怎么办-"

"Ask for support from Rei and...ask for the release of Unit 01 and its pilot Shinji Ikari."  
“请求丽支援，并要求释放初号机及其驾驶员碇真嗣。”

---

Gendo Ikari stood in his office, having just gotten off the phone with an operative from the test site. The situation had changed, but not to the point where he was readily worried.  
碇源堂站在他的办公室里，刚刚与试验场的一名特工通完电话。情况发生了变化，但还不至于让他立刻感到担忧。

"Is that you Fuyutsuki?" Asked Gendo as he heard the door open.  
“是你吗，冬月？”碇源堂听到门打开的声音问道。

"Yes." "是的。"

"What is the overall status of the situation?"  
"目前局势如何？"

"Unit 03 is on a rampages in the northern hills of Tokyo-3 and seems to be continuing south. An evacuation order has been issued."  
"03 号机在第三新东京市北部的山丘上暴走，并持续向南移动。已发布疏散命令。"

"...What else?" "...还有呢？"

"The Eva seems to have been taken over by the angel Bardiel, while the life of the pilot is unknown."  
"EVA 似乎已被天使 Bardiel 接管，而驾驶员的生命状况未知。"

"Reclassify Unit 03 as an angel and a threat to humanity. As for the life of the pilot," here he paused, turned around to face Fuyutsuki and said one word, "irrelevant."  
"将 03 号机重新分类为天使并对人类构成威胁。至于驾驶员的生命，"他顿了顿，转身面对冬月，说了一个词，"无关紧要。"

"And what about the request put in by captain Katsuragi?"  
"那葛城美里上尉的请求呢？"

Gendo took a long time to answer, thinking about the pros and cons of each action before he said, "Release Unit 01 from storage, though the pilot stays."  
源渡沉吟良久，权衡着每一步行动的利弊，最终说道：“将 01 号单位从储存中释放，但驾驶员保持不动。”

"...But then-" “……但这样一来——”

"And tell the engineers to outfit it with the dummy plug. This should be an adequate test for it."  
“并通知工程师们为其配备模拟插入栓。这应该足以对其进行一次充分的测试。”

Fuyutsuki nodded his head once, before leaving the room. Gendo meanwhile sat back down at his desk before picking up his phone and saying into the receiver, "Get me doctor Akagi."  
冬月点了点头，随即离开了房间。碇源堂则重新坐回桌前，拿起电话对着听筒说道：“让赤木博士来见我。”

---

Shinji knew that the test had started half an hour ago, but he still couldn't help but look at the clock every few minutes, hoping that the hands would suddenly start spinning faster. Sitting around and doing nothing was far worse then he had expected, and he found that he had soon worn a hole in the floor with his pacing. What he wouldn't give to be out of this shitty room.  
真嗣知道测试已经开始了半小时，但他还是忍不住每隔几分钟就看一眼时钟，希望指针能突然加速转动。无所事事地坐着比他预想的要糟糕得多，他发现自己很快就在地板上踱出了一个洞。他多么希望能离开这个糟糕的房间。

Maybe he would get his wish as he saw the door nob turn slightly, before being jerked forward, banging it off the opposite wall. Though it became clear that they weren't simply there to ask him questions.  
也许他会如愿以偿，因为他看到门把手微微转动，随后猛地向前一拉，撞到了对面的墙上。不过很快就清楚了，他们并不是来简单地问他问题的。

Four soldiers, complete with automatic weapons, stormed into his room, guns all aimed at him. Shinji stood dumbstruck at the wall of destruction that was just waiting for him to make a move that they even though as suspicious. If they did, his body would be riddled with bullet holes.  
四名士兵，全副武装，手持自动武器冲进他的房间，所有的枪口都瞄准了他。真嗣面对着这堵即将摧毁他的破坏之墙，呆若木鸡，只要他稍有可疑的动作，他们就会毫不犹豫地开枪，让他的身体布满弹孔。

Suddenly one of them motioned to the other, and what appeared to be the captain in charge, walked forward cautiously, keeping an eye on Shinji at all times.  
突然，其中一人向其他人示意，看似是队长的那位，小心翼翼地走上前，始终紧盯着真嗣。

"You're Ikari Shinji, correct?"  
“你是碇真嗣，对吧？”

"...Yes," said Shinji curtly.  
"...是的，" 真嗣简短地回答。

"You have been requested at Unit 03's testing grounds."  
"您被要求前往 03 号机测试场地。"

Shinji suddenly let out an angry snarl and yelled, "What happened to Asu-"  
真嗣突然发出愤怒的咆哮，大喊道："明日香怎么了-"

Cutting across him, the solider said, "Unit 03 is rampaging around the country side but is slowly making its way south, towards Tokyo-3. We have orders to escort or detain you as necessary as we bring you to Unit 01."  
士兵打断了他，说道：“03 号机正在乡间肆虐，但正缓慢向南移动，朝东京-3 方向前进。我们有命令护送或必要时拘留你，带你去见 01 号机。”

"I thought it was placed in storage?"  
“我以为它被封存了？”

The soldier completely ignored his question and instead said, "We don't want you to try anything Mr. Ikari, so if you can just follow us we can get this over with."  
士兵完全无视了他的问题，转而说道：“我们不希望你尝试任何举动，碇先生，只要你跟我们走，这事就能尽快结束。”

Shinji snorted, "Yeah...because I'd never try anything with soldiers watching me. Just lead the way before I feeling like venting my frustration on one of you."  
真嗣哼了一声，“是啊...因为有士兵盯着我，我怎么敢轻举妄动。快带路吧，不然我真想拿你们其中一个出出气。”

The soldiers must have taken his threat fairly seriously, because they all crouched on one knee, flipped the safety off, and put there index finger over the trigger.  
士兵们显然对他的威胁相当认真，因为他们全都单膝跪地，关闭了保险，并将食指放在了扳机上。

Sighing, Shinji said, "I was kidding..."  
叹了口气，真嗣说：“我开玩笑的...”

Seeing that he was completely laid back, the soldiers hesitantly removed their index fingers from the triggers, though they did not flip the safety back on.  
看到他完全放松的样子，士兵们犹豫地将食指从扳机上移开，尽管他们并没有重新打开保险。

"Lets go," said Shinji as he followed the soldier out the door and up several flights of stairs. He didn't think they'd want to take the elevator as they would be enclosed in a small space where they wouldn't have much room to shoot.  
“我们走吧，”真嗣说着，跟着士兵走出门，上了几层楼梯。他觉得他们不会想乘电梯，因为那样会被困在一个狭小的空间里，没有太多开枪的余地。

---

It felt oddly good to be back in the entry plug of Unit 01 after such a long while, and he also knew that his mother was watching over him silently. The only thing that made this painful was that he was supposed to battle an angel that had taken possession of an Eva's body while Asuka was inside the entry plug.  
时隔许久再次回到 01 号机的插入栓里，感觉出奇地好，他也知道母亲在默默地守护着他。唯一让人痛苦的是，他本应与一个占据 EVA 身体的使徒战斗，而明日香就在插入栓内。

Rocketing up elevator shaft number seven, he soared out through the end of it, landing cleanly on his feet. He was just inside the city limits of Tokyo-3 and the only thing that he could really see were a lot of trees and several power lines.  
他沿着第七号电梯井飞速上升，从井口一跃而出，稳稳地落在地面上。此刻他正位于东京-3 的市界内，眼前除了茂密的树木和几条高压电线，别无他物。

"Ikari-kun." “碇君。”

Rei in Unit-00 appeared next to him as she came up the same elevator shaft that he just did.  
零号机中的绫波丽紧随其后，从他刚刚离开的同一电梯井中现身，站在了他的身旁。

"Ayanami...Asuka..." "绫波...明日香..."

"...Its coming." "...它来了。"

Sure enough, the two of them saw it at the same time as it came over the hump of the hill in the distance. Large pieces of the black armor had been coated with the white, glue like substance that coated the entry plug that Asuka was stuck inside.  
果然，两人同时看到了它从远处山丘的隆起处出现。黑色装甲的大块部分被白色的、胶状物质覆盖，这种物质也覆盖了明日香被困的插入栓。

Shinji swallowed hard as the enormity of what he was supposed to do hit him, "Ayanami...how exactly are we supposed to-"  
真嗣艰难地咽了口唾沫，当他意识到自己将要承担的重任时，"绫波...我们究竟要怎么才能..."

Unit-03 suddenly rocketed down the hill, splitting the ground as it went and upending trees. Bracing himself, Shinji felt two large arms barrel themselves against Unit 01 arms, and felt pain constrict his arms.  
三号机突然从山坡上疾驰而下，所过之处地面裂开，树木翻倒。真嗣稳住自己，感觉到两只有力的手臂猛地撞击在初号机的手臂上，一阵剧痛紧缩了他的双臂。

"Asuka..." "明日香……"

Rei appeared out of nowhere and with her progressive knife in hand, drove it into the arm, through the armor and eventually down to the soft tissue underneath. Unit 03's mouth opened wide as it bellowed in anger and pain. Knocking Shinji out of the way, it pulled the knife out of its arm and flung it at Unit 00's direction.  
绫波不知从何处出现，手持她的高频振动刀，猛地刺入三号机的手臂，穿透装甲，最终刺入下方的软组织。三号机张大了嘴，愤怒与痛苦交织地咆哮着。它将真嗣撞开，拔出插在手臂上的刀，朝零号机的方向甩去。

Dodging it easily, Unit 00 ducked a series of vicious kicks and punches, until Unit 03 finally grabbed it by the throat with both hands and pinned it to the ground. Snarling in fury, Unit 03 continued strangling Unit 00 and Rei.  
轻松躲过，零号机避开了一连串凶狠的踢打，直到三号机最终用双手掐住它的喉咙，将其按倒在地。三号机愤怒地咆哮着，继续勒紧零号机和绫波的脖子。

Shinji with Unit 01, swung its arm around Unit 03 neck, catching it by the throat and flung it backwards, and off of Rei."  
一号线与真嗣一起，挥动手臂绕过三号机的脖子，抓住它的喉咙，猛地将其向后甩开，使它脱离了绫波。

"Thank you, Ikari-kun," gasped Rei.  
“谢谢你，碇君，”绫波喘息着说。

"Ayanami...how are we supposed to fight this thing without hurting Asuka?"  
“绫波...我们该怎么对付这东西而不伤害到明日香？”

"The commander gave us the order to defeat it in a fashion that suggested the pilot of 02's life as an afterthought."  
“指挥官下达的命令是击败它，似乎完全没考虑 02 号机驾驶员的安危。”

It took Shinji a second for him to decipher the meaning in her words, but when he did, he felt boiling blood rattle his ears, as he realized what his father had said.  
真嗣花了片刻才理解她话中的含义，但当他明白过来时，愤怒的热血冲击着他的耳膜，他意识到父亲的话意味着什么。

"Ayanami...did my father say that?"  
"绫波...我父亲真的那么说了吗？"

"Yes, he did..." "是的，他确实说了..."

Shinji's snarl was so loud that it rattled the eardrums of everybody in the commander center. Yelling at the top of his voice, he bellowed over the intercom, "WHERE THE HELL IS THAT BASTARD! DON'T YOU DARE FORFEIT ASUKA'S LIFE YOU DECEITFUL ASSHOLE!"  
真嗣的咆哮声如此之大，以至于指挥中心里的每个人都感到耳膜震动。他对着对讲机大声吼叫，"那个混蛋到底在哪儿！你敢拿明日香的生命开玩笑，你这个骗子混蛋！"

"Shinji think of it from a militaristic standpoint."  
"真嗣，从军事的角度来考虑这件事。"

"I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE MILITARY OR NERV! I WOULD RATHER DIE THEN TAKE ASUKA'S LIFE!"  
"我他妈才不在乎军队还是 NERV！我宁愿死也不愿夺走明日香的生命！"

"Ikari-kun!" "碇君！"

Shinji had just enough time to roll out of the way as Unit 03 charged at him on all fours, swiping at the armor of his Eva as it went. Skidding across the ground, Unit 03 poised on all fours again, before flinging itself through the air, and landing just where Unit 00 had been moments before.  
真嗣刚来得及滚向一旁，03 号机便四肢着地向他冲来，挥舞着爪子划过他的 EVA 装甲。03 号机在地面上滑行，再次四肢着地蓄势，随即一跃而起，正好落在 00 号机刚才所在的位置。

"Ayanami!" “绫波！”

Running at break neck speed, Shinji flung himself in front of Unit 00 as Unit 03 bore down upon her. Grasping the side of Unit 01's head, Unit 03 smashed in through somebody's abandoned house, and drug it through the dirt, before jumping up in the air to pounce on it.  
真嗣以极快的速度奔跑，挡在 00 号机前，面对着逼近的 03 号机。03 号机抓住 01 号机的头部，撞穿了一座废弃的房屋，拖着它在泥土中前行，然后一跃而起，准备扑击。

Rolling out of the way quickly, Shinji swung Unit 01's legs outward, catching Unit 03 on the way down, and knocking it off balance. As Unit 03 stumbled backwards, Shinji grabbed both of his shoulders and forcefully pinned it against the ground.  
迅速滚向一旁，真嗣挥动初号机的双腿向外侧扫去，在零三号机下落途中将其绊倒，使其失去平衡。零三号机踉跄后退之际，真嗣抓住它的双肩，用力将其按倒在地。

"Asuka, damn it answer me! You're the last person I know that would give up on this. Wake up!"  
“明日香，该死，回答我！我知道你是绝不会在这种时候放弃的。醒醒！”

Unit 03 simply opened its mouth and roared. Forcefully ripping Unit 01's hands of its shoulders, it kicked Unit 01 in the chest, knocking the breath out of Shinji in the process, and sent him skidding across the earthen ground, kicking up great chunks of dirt.  
零三号机只是张开嘴咆哮一声。它强行挣脱初号机双手的束缚，一脚踢在初号机的胸口，让真嗣瞬间喘不过气来，随即被踢得滑过地面，扬起大块泥土。

Turning to Unit 00, it flew at Rei, tearing apart the ground as it ran, and grasped Unit 00 around the throat and started strangling it savagely. Even though Rei's synchronization wasn't nearly as strong as Shinji's she was still able to feel a fraction of the pain Unit 00 felt, and her trachea was soon being constricted.  
转向零号机，它向绫波疾驰而去，撕裂着地面，一把掐住零号机的喉咙，开始野蛮地勒紧。尽管绫波的同步率远不及真嗣，但她仍能感受到零号机所受痛苦的些许，很快她的气管便被压迫。

As Shinji stood up, he had to fight the urge to vomit out of his system. Shaking himself of the dizziness, he saw Unit 03 bearing down over Unit 00 and crushing its wind pipe. Sudden anger shot through Shinji even with his best attempts to control it. Next second he was beside Unit 03, and slammed an AT-field directly into the side of his foe.  
当真嗣站起身时，他不得不强忍住呕吐的冲动。他摇晃着摆脱眩晕，看到三号机正压在零号机上，碾碎其气管。尽管他竭力控制，愤怒仍如闪电般袭来。下一秒，他已出现在三号机旁，猛地将 AT 力场砸向对手的侧身。

Unit 03 went flying backwards, kicking up dirt, toppling power lines, and making houses turn to powder.  
三号机向后飞去，扬起尘土，撞倒电线杆，房屋化为齑粉。

"Ayanami...you okay?" "绫波...你还好吗？"

"Unit 00 has suffered some contamination, but I will be fine.  
"零号机受到了一些污染，但我会没事的。"

"You sure?" "你确定吗？"

"Yes, I will be fine..."  
"是的，我会没事的..."

"...Okay." “……好吧。”

Looking back over at Unit 03, Shinji had just enough time to see it getting up, before both its arms suddenly swung at them from four hundred yards away. Shinji managed to dodge out of the way, but Rei didn't react quickly enough and Unit 03 hands wrapped around Unit 00 head, and pummeled it against the ground.  
回头望向 03 号机，真嗣刚好看到它站起身来，紧接着它的双臂突然从四百码外向他们挥来。真嗣设法躲开了，但绫波反应不够快，03 号机的手缠住了 00 号机的头部，并将其猛击在地。

"Ayanam-" “绫波——”

Unit 03 other arm swung outward, gripping Unit 01's wind wipe, constricting it, and almost instantly, Shinji felt as though he was going to pass out. Gripping both his hands around Unit 03's arm, he twisted it, forcing a break, and making Unit 03 rear backwards in anger and frustration.  
03 号机的另一只手臂向外挥出，抓住了 01 号机的风挡，紧紧勒住，几乎立刻，真嗣感到自己快要昏厥。他双手紧握住 03 号机的手臂，用力扭转，迫使其断裂，令 03 号机因愤怒和挫败而向后仰去。

Roaring angrily, the bulge in the side of its arm suddenly rightened itself with a loud snap, setting it back into place. Snarling angrily, the holsters for the progressive knifes in the shoulders suddenly exploded, showering the ground in flesh and bone, as two humanoid arms shot out of the wound.  
愤怒咆哮着，它手臂侧面的隆起突然发出一声巨响，自行复位。愤怒地咆哮着，肩部用于装载渐进式刀具的枪套突然爆炸，将血肉和骨头洒满地面，同时两条类人手臂从伤口中猛地伸出。

Grasping Unit 01's arm, Unit 03 cleanly broke it, making Shinji howler as pain coursed through his right arm.  
抓住初号机的手臂，三号机干净利落地将其折断，让真嗣因右臂传来的剧痛而嚎叫。

Moving over to Unit 00, Unit 03 grabbed the right arm and pulled with all its might, until the arm came clean off, spewing blood and gore around the ground and on its hands. Throwing the arm off to the side, it reared backwards and prepared to smash a fist into the head of Unit 00 when an AT-field flashed suddenly, severing one of its newborn hands.  
三号机移动到零号机旁，抓住其右臂全力拉扯，直到手臂完全脱落，鲜血和内脏四溅，洒满地面和它的双手。将手臂甩到一旁，它后仰准备用拳头猛击零号机的头部，此时 AT 力场突然闪现，切断了它新生的手。

Blood spewed out of what was once a shoulder and seemed to rain down upon its head, creating a fountain.  
鲜血从曾经是肩膀的地方喷涌而出，仿佛化作雨幕洒落在其头部，形成了一道血泉。

Shinji started to lose focus as Unit 03 slowly started walking towards him, regrowing its arm in the process.  
随着三号机缓缓向他走来，手臂在过程中逐渐再生，真嗣开始失去集中力。

"Shinji...what are you doing?"  
“真嗣……你在做什么？”

Shinji froze as he heard his fathers voice over the intercom.  
听到父亲的声音从对讲机传来，真嗣僵住了。

"Fa-fath-" "爸、爸爸——"

"The enemy is in front of you...destroy it."  
"敌人就在你面前……消灭它。"

"But Asuka's in there! I can't hurt her!"  
"但明日香在里面！我不能伤害她！"

"Doesn't matter. That is an angel, our enemy."  
"这无关紧要。那是使徒，我们的敌人。"

"I'd rather die then kill her."  
"我宁愿死也不愿杀她。"

"...If you are so set on dying then find death in your own way, but don't go throwing away Unit 01 which your mother put her life's work into."  
"...如果你执意要死，那就用自己的方式去死吧，但别把初号机——你母亲倾注了一生心血的初号机——白白浪费掉。"

"Fa-"

Shinji felt the density of the LCL fluid change abruptly, as everything went dark.  
真嗣感觉到 LCL 液体的密度突然改变，随后四周陷入一片黑暗。

"Father...what are you..."  
"父亲...你在做什么..."

Shinji felt something moving behind his seat and next second a robotic figure was hovering over him, locking his hands against the controls of Unit 01 with several metallic clicks. It bent down to an inhuman level so that a monitor with the words DMYSYS displayed in front of him. Then his visual screen suddenly turned a blood red color as he felt the the Eva start moving again.  
真嗣感觉到座椅后有什么东西在移动，下一秒一个机器人形象的物体悬浮在他上方，伴随着几声金属的咔嗒声，将他的双手牢牢固定在初号机的控制器上。它弯下腰到一个非人的程度，一个显示着'DMYSYS'字样的屏幕出现在他面前。随后，他的视觉屏幕突然变成了血红色，同时感觉到 EVA 再次开始移动。

"FATHER YOU-" "父亲您——"

Unit 01 charged forward towards its target, all sign of Shinji's childish emotions lost. As Unit 03 flung out its arms to attack, Unit 01 one grabbed both arms, and pulled Unit 03 towards itself, before kicking it squarely in the chest, sending it flying backwards at the speed of a jet plane.  
初号机向着目标疾冲而去，真嗣那孩子气的情感已荡然无存。当三号机伸出双臂发起攻击时，初号机一把抓住了它的双臂，将其拉向自己，然后狠狠一脚踢在胸口，以喷气式飞机般的速度将三号机击飞出去。

Crashing into a nearby hillside, Unit 03 dodged out of the way just in time as Unit 01 followed up with swift punch to where its head had been moments before. Gouging out a great mound of dirt with his punch, Unit 01 jumped high in the air, before falling down directly in front of Unit 03.  
猛地撞向附近的山坡，03 号机及时闪避，而 01 号机紧随其后，迅速出拳击向它头部刚刚所在的位置。01 号机一拳挖出一大块泥土，随即高高跃起，直落于 03 号机面前。

Unit 03 swung outwards with its stretched arms, grabbing Unit 01 left arm and attempted to pull it off as it had done to Unit 00. Unit 01 reared its head, grasping at the outstretched arm of Unit 03 and ripped a large chunk of flesh off the bone. Tossing it aside, Unit 01 followed up with quick jab to the open wound, splitting the bone instantly.  
03 号机伸出双臂向外挥舞，试图抓住 01 号机的左臂，就像之前对 00 号机所做的那样。01 号机猛地抬头，抓住 03 号机伸出的手臂，撕下一大块肉。随后，01 号机将肉块抛开，紧接着对那开放的伤口快速一击，瞬间击碎了骨头。

Unit 03 let go in pain, and retreated backwards a few steps before Unit 01 roared in front of it with its fist cocked backwards. Punching with the full power of an Eva, the shockwave that followed stripped the bark off trees, and shattered the windows of houses within a thousand yard radius.  
03 号机因疼痛松手，后退几步，而 01 号机在它面前咆哮，拳头蓄势待发。以 EVA 的全力一击，随之而来的冲击波剥离了树木的树皮，震碎了方圆千码内房屋的窗户。

Staggering backwards, Unit 03 clutched at the large dent in its chest, just as Unit 01 palmed Unit 03's head in its hand. Smashing it into the ground repeatedly, Unit 01 proceeded to start the dismemberment.  
踉跄后退，03 号机紧抓着胸前的大凹痕，与此同时，01 号机一掌按住 03 号机的头部，将其反复砸向地面，随即开始了肢解。

Finally Unit 01's mouth opened, as it tore into the lower abdominal cavity of Unit 03. Organs were removed and slithered out onto the already blood soaked ground, while bone was smashed cleanly in half as though it had been cleaved by an axe.  
最终，01 号机张开嘴，撕开了 03 号机的下腹部。内脏被扯出，滑落到早已血迹斑斑的地面上，骨头则被干净利落地砸成两截，仿佛被斧头劈开一般。

Throughout the horror fest, Shinji constantly cursed back at his father. Didn't he understand that Asuka was the first person that he had connected with? Why didn't he understand that she was someone special, someone important to him?  
在这场恐怖的折磨中，真嗣不停地咒骂着他的父亲。难道他不明白，明日香是他第一个与之建立联系的人吗？为什么他不明白她是一个特别的人，一个对他来说很重要的人？

As Unit 01 started ripping apart the flesh of Unit 03, Shinji almost gave up hope when he heard a familiar voice resounding in his head.  
当 01 号机开始撕裂 03 号机的血肉时，真嗣几乎要放弃希望，这时他听到一个熟悉的声音在他脑海中回响。

"_What the fuck is this shit? Son of a bitch trying to control me with this fucking copy."_  
“这他妈是什么鬼东西？这个混蛋想用这该死的复制品控制我。”

Shinji had never heard the 'voice' talk in such a scornful tone before.  
真嗣从未听过这个‘声音’用如此轻蔑的语气说话。

"_Bastard's trying to control me, not like it will do any good without you here anyway. I'm going to connect directly with you again. If we achieve a high enough sync rate we should be able gain control again."_  
"混蛋想控制我，没有你在这儿，他再怎么努力也没用。我要再次直接与你连接。如果我们能达到足够高的同步率，应该能重新获得控制权。"

Shinji nodded and prepared to feel the nerves pierce his skin and connect directly with his thoughts. Feeling a hot white poker hit his brain he knew that the connection had been made.  
真嗣点点头，准备感受神经刺穿皮肤，直接与他的思维相连。感觉到一股灼热的白刃刺入大脑，他知道连接已经建立。

"_Haven't done this in a while..."_  
"好久没这么做了..."

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"_Because you learned how to control the Eva by yourself. I was simply guiding you the other times. Now quiet and think about dismantling this pile of shit."_  
"因为你已经学会了自己控制 Eva。之前我只是引导你。现在安静下来，想想怎么拆解这堆烂摊子。"

"I have something else I wanted to-"  
"我还有其他事情想做——"

"_Not now, do you want to fix this or not."_  
"现在不行，你想不想修好它？"

'Right,' thought Shinji. '没错，' 真嗣心想。

Closing his eyes, he thought of Asuka and nobody else. If she wasn't one hundred percent perfectly fine, heads would roll, and not in a figurative sense.  
他闭上眼睛，心中只想着明日香，别无他人。如果她不是百分之百完全无恙，那可就有人要倒霉了，绝非比喻。

He pictured them back in Misato's apartment. No school, no Nerv crap, just the two of them lazing around on the couch together. She'd be watching T.V. as usual, and he'd be listening to his SDAT. Eventually she'd yell at him to make dinner or go somewhere else because he was bothering her. He didn't care to have it anyway else.  
他想象着他们回到美里小姐的公寓。没有学校，没有 NERV 那些破事，只有他们俩一起懒洋洋地躺在沙发上。她会像往常一样看电视，而他则听着他的 SDAT。最终她会大喊让他去做饭或去别的地方，因为他打扰到她了。他并不介意这样的日常。

Inside the Geofront, Gendo was presiding over the task of managing the dummy plug. Ritsuko, who may have been the lead designer of it, was still unknown at the time because of the activation test with Unit 03.  
在 Geofront 内部，Gendo 正主持着管理模拟插入栓的任务。当时，作为其首席设计师的律子仍身份不明，这是因为与 03 号机进行的激活测试。

"Dummy plug is operating at full capacity with a minute and a half of remaining battery life"  
“模拟插入栓正以满负荷运行，电池剩余寿命为一分钟三十秒。”

"Hang on..." “坚持住……”

Fuyutsuko who was standing beside Gendo asked, "What?"  
站在源堂旁边的冬月问道："什么？"

"The plug depth is increasing rapidly...passing over the danger area...one hundred...one hundred and ten. Pilot seems to be willfully entering the containment zone."  
"插入深度正在迅速增加...已超过危险区域...一百...一百一十。驾驶员似乎在故意进入封锁区。"

"Cut the synchronization of the nerve receptors down to-"  
"将神经接收器的同步率降低至-"

"Hold on," said Gendo in his loud voice.  
"等等，" 源渡用他响亮的声音说道。

"But sir, any more of this and the pilot might never be human again."  
"但是先生，再这样下去，驾驶员可能永远无法恢复人性了。

"He can handle it. Continue as planned, release the limiters on the dummy plug."  
"他能应付。按计划继续，解除傀儡系统的限制器。

Back inside Unit 01, Shinji felt the blood slowly flowing from the small piercings in his skin and dissolve into the LCL fluid.  
在初号机内部，真嗣感觉到血液从皮肤上的小孔中缓缓流出，溶解在 LCL 液体中。

"_Okay...I'm going to attempt to break the control over this thing. Get ready, that thing out there is able to regenerate faster then I expected. I don't want to gain control again, only to have us lose next second."_  
“好的……我要尝试打破这东西的控制。准备好，外面那家伙的再生速度比我预想的要快。我不想再次夺回控制权，结果下一秒我们就输了。”

"Ready whenever." “随时待命。”

"_Disengaging...now..."_ "正在解除连接...现在..."

Shinji immediately felt the difference in the LCL fluid. It became much lighter, and less hostile. The blood red glow around the screens slowly faded away, letting Shinji see the landscape once again.  
真嗣立刻感受到了 LCL 液体的变化。它变得轻了许多，也不再那么敌意十足。屏幕周围血红色的光芒缓缓消退，让真嗣再次看到了外面的景象。

"_Shit..."_ "该死..."

"What?" "什么？"

"_That damn thing is trying to come back online."_  
"那该死的东西正试图重新上线。"

"Can't you do anything to stop it?"  
"你就不能做点什么阻止它吗？"

"_Yes, but not for very long."_  
"能，但坚持不了多久。"

"How long!" "多久了？"

"_A minute at most."_ "最多一分钟。"

"Do it. I've got to get Asuka out of that thing before it has a chance to regenerate."  
"动手吧。我得在它有机会再生之前把明日香救出来。"

Moving so that he was standing directly beside the broken Eva's head, he molded his thoughts to that of a shape that would perfectly fit around the entry plug Asuka was in. Now projecting it, he carefully concentrated on that single point and started crisscrossing other points until he had created something like a net. Filling in the small holes, he carefully carved away the white substance that was clinging to the entry plug, and gently lifted it out of the Eva.  
他移动到破损的 Eva 头部旁边，将自己的思维塑造成一个能完美契合插入栓的形状。现在他将其具象化，小心翼翼地集中注意力于那个点，并开始交叉连接其他点，直到编织出一张类似网的东西。填补小孔，他仔细地削去附着在插入栓上的白色物质，并轻轻将其从 Eva 中抬起。

"_You're getting pretty good at creating exactly what you want..."_  
“你越来越擅长创造你想要的东西了...”

"Thanks," mumbled Shinji as he chose a place to set the entry plug down  
“谢谢，”真嗣咕哝着，选择了一个地方放下插入栓

"_Now hurry up and destroy the rest of it."_  
"快点，把剩下的也毁掉。"

Shinji nodded and drew back Unit 01's fist, and smashed against the Evangelions skull. Brain matter exploded and shattered the ground with bits of gray tissue.  
真嗣点头，指挥初号机收回拳头，猛击在使徒的头骨上。脑浆爆裂，灰色的组织碎片四溅，将地面击碎。

"Its over," breathed Shinji.  
"结束了，" 真嗣轻声说道。

---

The aftermath of the battle took a while to mull over. Misato and Ritsuko had been found with no bodily injury. Rei was fine though a little sore, and Unit 00 would need some replacement part.  
战斗后的余波需要一段时间来消化。美里和律子被发现时身体并无大碍。绫波虽然有些酸痛，但并无大碍，而零号机则需要一些替换零件。

Asuka though...Shinji still wasn't allowed to see her since her admittance to Nerv hospital.  
至于明日香...自从她被送进 NERV 医院后，真嗣仍未被允许探望她。

He had been the first to see her, and it was something that would probably forever stick in his mind when he opened managed to get into the entry plug.  
他是第一个见到她的人，这一幕或许将永远烙印在他的记忆中，当他设法进入插入栓时。

He had forcefully ejected himself for Unit 01, and slowly climbed his way down to the base of the foot. When he had arrived at the entry plug, he realized that the handle had the glue like substance caked over it. He tried several times to break through to the handle, but he found that it was just to strong. He eventually decided to try something.  
他强行将自己从初号机中弹射出来，缓缓爬下至脚部基座。当他到达插入栓时，发现把手被一种胶状物质覆盖着。他尝试了几次想要突破到把手，却发现它实在太坚固了。最终，他决定尝试其他方法。

He had become conscious of his own AT-field, it felt like his outer skin was coated in jello. Molding it to his thought, he carefully sliced a sizable hole in the metal of the entry plug. He had expected to step into waist deep LCL fluid, but was surprised when the liquid barely came up to his knees.  
他开始意识到自己的 AT 力场，感觉就像外皮涂了一层果冻。他按照自己的想法小心翼翼地在插入栓的金属上切开了一个大洞。他本以为会踏入齐腰深的 LCL 液体，却惊讶地发现液体仅没过膝盖。

Crawling over to where Asuka was, he found her hand and squeezed it, expecting to feel her reassuring warmth that she was okay back. He did not expect to feel her hand, freezing cold, and coated in her own blood.  
他爬到明日香身边，找到她的手并紧紧握住，期待感受到她安然无恙的温暖回应。但他没想到，她的手冰冷无比，还沾满了她自己的血。

After the medics arrived he got a good look at he face and realized that her she was coated in her own blood, and yet, she didn't have a wound on herself. After that, Shinji had to be detained as he had caused a large fuss, and nearly broke several peoples necks trying to get to Asuka.  
医护人员到达后，他仔细看了她的脸，发现她满脸都是自己的血，然而，她身上却没有一处伤口。之后，真嗣因为引起了大骚动而被拘留，他差点扭断几个人的脖子，只为冲向明日香。

Right now he was back in his favorite room, that made him look like a mental patient.  
此刻他又回到了他最喜欢的房间，那让他看起来像个精神病患者。

Curling up in a ball on his unfavorable bed, he heard a brief knock on the door and Ritsuko poked her head in.  
他蜷缩在不太喜欢的床上，听到门口传来短暂的敲门声，随后律子探头进来。

"I wasn't sure if you had been asleep..."  
"我不确定你是否已经睡着了……"

"Like I could sleep after today...I don't think that I'll ever get that image out of my head."  
"经历了今天的事，我怎么可能睡得着……我想我永远也忘不了那个画面。"

"You should be just happy she's alive, though not readily well."  
"你应该庆幸她还活着，尽管状况并不太好。"

"How is she, and can I see her?"  
"她怎么样了，我能见她吗？"

"She's fine in the sense that she's breathing and alive, and no you can't see her."  
"她还好，至少还活着、在呼吸，但你不能见她。"

"Why is that," asked Shinji, slowly brimming with anger?  
"为什么？" 真嗣问道，怒气逐渐升腾。

"You won't be able to handle it, and I don't want your reaction to send her into a coma. Thats the last thing we need right now."  
"你应付不来的，我不想你的反应让她陷入昏迷。那可是我们现在最不需要的麻烦。"

"What is wrong with her? She seemed fine physically-"  
"她怎么了？她身体看起来没什么问题——"

"Thats what you were briefly able to see, and its lucky the medical team got there so fast, she was slipping."  
"那只是你短暂看到的表象，幸好医疗队来得快，她当时情况正在恶化。"

"Are you going to-" "你打算去——"

"She lost roughly half the blood in her body."  
"她失去了体内大约一半的血液。"

"What! How!" "什么！怎么会！"

"I only have a theory as to that, and its pretty farfetched."  
"我对此只有一个理论，而且相当牵强。"

"I don't care." "我不在乎。"

"Ok then...hows this. The angel that we encountered seemed to be able to contaminate other hosts. My question is, what was that limited to?"  
"那好吧……这样如何。我们遇到的那位天使似乎能够感染其他宿主。我的问题是，这种能力有何限制？"

"I'm not following you." "我没听懂你的意思。"

"During the activation test, Asuka wasn't completely there, and it was apparent. She hasn't been coping well since the-"  
"在激活测试期间，明日香明显心不在焉，她自从那件事之后就一直没能好好应对。"

"Right," said Shinji, cutting her off."  
"对，" 真嗣打断了她的话。"

"We shouldn't have used her. We should have used you like we originally thought of, or chosen somebody from your school."  
"我们不该用她的。我们原本考虑用你，或者从你们学校选一个人。"

"From my...what?" "从我的...什么？"

"Each child in your class has the possibility of being an Eva pilot. Touji was a prime candidate before Asuka was chosen."  
"你们班上的每个孩子都有可能成为 EVA 驾驶员。在选择明日香之前，冬二曾是最佳人选。"

"Why wasn't he chosen?" “为什么没有选他？”

"Something about the belief that children that have siblings don't produce good sync ratios. Anyways, Asuka didn't want to do the test, but because she was filling in for you, she was okay with it enough to accept it. That led to her mentality being damaged during the test. My guess is that she had some encounter with the angel in her mind, and willfully let it take control of her."  
“大概是认为有兄弟姐妹的孩子同步率不会太高。总之，惣流本来不想参加测试，但因为她是替你去的，所以勉强接受了。这导致她在测试中心态受损。我猜她在意识中遭遇了使徒，并故意让它控制了自己。”

"Then she was possessed by the angel? But then what about the Eva? Was it possessing both of them?"  
“那她是被使徒附身了吗？但 EVA 又怎么回事？难道两者都被附身了？”

"You know how you gain wounds and get hurt every time you enter Unit 01, because you have such a high sync rate with it."  
"你知道每次你进入 01 号机时都会受伤，因为你的同步率太高了。"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"What if Asuka experienced that, only opposite."  
"如果明日香经历的是相反的情况呢？"

"I don't understa-" "我不明白——"

"Asuka took the wounds for Unit 03. The angel was possessing her, not the Eva."  
“明日香替三号机承受了那些伤。是使徒在控制她，而非 Eva。”

"But how did all that blood?"  
“但那些血是怎么回事？”

"High speed regeneration most likely. Asuka would take the brunt of the damage from the attack, and the angel would be fine. After the dummy plug was used though, the angel couldn't keep up with regenerating constantly."  
“很可能是高速再生。明日香会承受攻击的主要伤害，而使徒则安然无恙。不过，在使用模拟插入栓后，使徒无法持续再生。”

"But why possess her? What was the point?"  
"但为什么要附身于她？这有什么意义呢？"

"As to that...I have no idea."  
"至于那个...我完全不知道。"

Shinji paused for a second before he said, "You said something about a dummy plug. Was that the thing that took over for me during the battle?"  
真嗣停顿了一下，然后说道：“你提到过一个模拟插入栓。那东西是在战斗中代替我的吗？”

"Yes..." "是的..."

Shinji sat there for a while on the edge of his bed, thinking about what he wanted to do. Of course he wanted to run to Asuka's side, but he had to agree with Ritsuko for once. Seeing her later would have to wait, and besides, he had somebody else he wanted to talk to.  
真嗣坐在床边，思索着自己想做的事情。当然，他想要跑到明日香身边，但这次他不得不赞同律子。见她的事只能稍后再说，而且，他还有其他人想谈谈。

Standing up abruptly, Shinji said, "I have something that I want to help me with."  
真嗣突然站起来，说道：“我有件事想请人帮忙。”

Ritsuko hesitated, unsure whether she should agree, not knowing what it could be. Figuring that it couldn't be anything harming, she said, "If its something within my power...I shall try."  
律子犹豫了一下，不确定是否应该答应，也不知道那会是什么。她想应该不会有什么害处，便说：“如果是我力所能及的事……我会尽力。”

Taking a large gulp of air, he got the words out of his mouth that he had been thinking about for a while these past few weeks. Words that he had always been too afraid to ask because of the shear fear and intimidation that pushed at him when he thought of the man.  
他深吸一口气，终于将这几周来一直萦绕在心头的话说了出来。这些话他一直不敢问，因为每当想到那个男人，巨大的恐惧和威压就会向他袭来。

"Ritsuko...I want to talk to my father..."  
“律子...我想和我父亲谈谈...”

**P.S. Merry Christmas! 附：圣诞快乐！**

### Chapter 15: Confusion

**Yawn...well, here is the new chapter. Wasn't sure how quickly I'd start working on this one, but I went to San Fran on a vacation and found myself working on it in my spare time, and I'd estimate this story has around ten more chapters till its finished, though thats still just an estimate. On another note, I got my mom to watch Episode 1 of Evangelion since I told her that if she wants to read my story, then she has to have some understanding of the terminology and how Shinji and Asuka's relationship develops. She seemed to like it also, which doesn't surprise me really since she enjoyed Elfen Lied, which is gory beyond all belief. Anyway enough jabbering out of me, I'm going to bed.  
哈欠...好吧，新章节来了。我不确定自己会多快开始写这一章，但我去旧金山度假时，在空闲时间就开始动笔了，我估计这个故事还有大约十章就完结了，不过这还只是个估计。另外，我让妈妈看了《新世纪福音战士》的第一集，因为我说如果她想读我的故事，她得对术语和真嗣与明日香的关系发展有所了解。她似乎也很喜欢，这并不让我惊讶，因为她之前也很喜欢《妖精的旋律》，那部剧血腥得超乎想象。好了，不多说了，我要去睡觉了。**

Gendo Ikari sat at his desk, facing the window directly behind him that showed the entirety of the Geofront. Though he didn't want to admit it, the pilot of Eva 01 had affected his plans with this latest bout of courage. He had never imagined that he would have managed to override the dummy plug from inside the Eva. Though what might have amazed him more was that he had managed to destroy the angel while keeping Unit 02's pilot relatively alive.  
碇源堂坐在他的办公桌前，面对着身后直接展示第三新东京市全貌的窗户。虽然他不想承认，但初号机的驾驶员在这场最新的勇气表现中影响了他的计划。他从未想过他能从内部覆盖 EVA 中的模拟插入栓。尽管更让他惊讶的是，他居然能在保持二号机驾驶员相对存活的情况下摧毁使徒。

He had seen the connection between the two long before even they had realized it themselves. And why not? They were both so similar that they were bound to connect in some way, for better or for worse. He had not expected things to turn out as they had, with there lives so entwined that they affected each other so greatly. Had he planned it? Maybe deep down in the recesses of his mind he had hoped for such a scenario, but things had escalated to a point that surpassed his wishes.  
他早在他们自己意识到之前，就已看出了两人之间的联系。这又有什么奇怪的呢？他们如此相似，注定会在某种程度上产生交集，无论是好是坏。他未曾预料到事情会发展到如此地步，他们的生活如此紧密相连，彼此影响深远。他是否曾计划这一切？或许在内心深处，他曾暗自期待过这样的局面，但事态的发展已超出了他的期望。

Admittedly, he had leaked information about the pilot of Unit 02 to her father, in which he took the assumed role of a revived father reuniting with a daughter. Things could not have gone better as the pilot of 01 consoled her and was a comforting item in which she could lean on. What did he care if a CEO in a large company was incapacitated because of his actions? Though he had not counted upon 01's pilots actions. He had gone beyond what could be considered as...normal, and with good reason, as he had angel blood flowing through his veins.  
无可否认，他向她父亲泄露了关于 02 机驾驶员的信息，扮演了一个复活父亲与女儿重逢的角色。事情进展得不能再顺利了，01 机的驾驶员安慰着她，成为她可以依靠的慰藉。一个大公司的 CEO 因他的行为而陷入困境，他又何曾在意？尽管他未曾料到 01 机驾驶员的行动会超出常理，而且有充分的理由，毕竟他体内流淌着天使之血。

Seele would never guess. While they had fruitlessly searched for the remains of something long since lost, he had carefully molded the pilot of Unit 01 since day one, since Yui had died.  
Seele 永远猜不到。在他们徒劳地寻找早已消失无踪的遗迹时，他从第一天起，自 Yui 去世后，就精心塑造了初号机的驾驶员。

At the thought of her, a shadow passed over Gendo's face for no more than an instance. He had thought that he had gotten rid of such emotions, but humans were such weak creatures. They suffered from such diseases that would be deemed substandard to the average mammal. Everything would change though at the coming of Instrumentality, and he would spearhead it all. He held all the pieces after all. Unit 01, its pilot, the Spear of Longinus, and Lilith. What could possibly stop him?  
想到她，Gendo 的脸上掠过一丝阴影，不过转瞬即逝。他本以为自己已经摆脱了这些情感，但人类就是如此脆弱的生物。他们承受着连普通哺乳动物都不屑一顾的疾病。然而，随着人类补完计划的来临，一切都将改变，而他将引领这一切。毕竟，他掌握着所有关键：初号机、其驾驶员、朗基努斯之枪，还有莉莉丝。还有什么能阻止他呢？

...Shinji could... ...真嗣或许能...

"Yes...he could," Gendo muttered.  
“是的……他能，”源度喃喃道。

He had long since referred to him as nothing more than an object, and it hurt to acknowledge him as a human being. If he had been more like her...but what's done is done.  
他早已将他视为一个物体，而非人类，这种认知令人心痛。如果他能更像她一些……但事已至此，无可挽回。

His growth was exceptional, more than that really, it was extraordinary. Even Ritsuko was surprised at how much he had changed, how much he had adapted to his abnormality. And yet, he had never been at such a point in his life where he feared a different outcome.  
他的成长异常出色，甚至可以说是非凡的。就连律子也惊讶于他的变化之大，以及他对异常情况的适应能力。然而，他从未像现在这样，对另一种可能的结果感到恐惧。

Shinji was strong, no getting by that, and he had begun to realize it, even take shape in his mind of what he was capable of. Gendo didn't like this freethinking. He was supposed to be the one in control, that was the whole point of assigning the pilot of 02 to 03 for the activation test.  
真嗣确实强大，这一点毋庸置疑，他已经开始意识到自己的能力，甚至在心中形成了自己能做什么的轮廓。源堂不喜欢这种自由思考。他本应是掌控一切的人，这就是为什么将 02 号机驾驶员分配给 03 号机进行激活测试的全部意义所在。

He had to control Shinji, and what better way then holding the pilot of 02 over his head, for Gendo knew that Shinji could never refuse a demand if her life was in danger. But still...how had it happened?  
他必须控制真嗣，而最好的方法莫过于用 02 号机驾驶员的生命来威胁他，因为源堂知道，只要她的生命受到威胁，真嗣绝不会拒绝任何要求。但即便如此...这一切又是如何发生的呢？

Why had the dummy plug not registered properly when first inserted in Unit 01 during the first attempt at combating the angel? Did Yui reject him? It didn't seem possible, but there was still a probability of it happening.  
为什么在第一次尝试对抗使徒时，插入到 01 号机中的模拟插入栓没有正确注册？是唯拒绝了他吗？这似乎不可能，但仍存在这种可能性。

So then he had had no choice but to have Shinji pilot the Eva while the dummy plug was still inserted. It seemed that the dummy plug was able to function properly as long as Shinji was inside the plug. Certainly it seemed that way. But during the fight against the angel, Shinji had arrested control away from him and forced the dummy plug to cease its function. How had he done it? It almost seemed impossible that he would have been able to accomplish it without some sort of help. Then did Yui...or something else.  
于是，他别无选择，只能让真嗣在插入栓仍处于模拟模式时驾驶 EVA。似乎只要真嗣在插入栓内，模拟模式就能正常运作。确实，看起来是这样。但在与使徒的战斗中，真嗣夺取了控制权，迫使模拟模式停止运作。他是怎么做到的？这几乎不可能，除非他得到了某种帮助。那么是 Yui...还是其他什么东西呢？

Well, he supposed that the outcome was still within management. The pilot of 02 was supposed to loose her life during this battle, but she seemed to have pulled through, at least at the moment. Whether it was Shinji's timely arrival, or her own willpower which seemed to be extraordinary in its own right...well, she would be out of commission for a while, and as long as she still survived, she still held a purpose. He supposed he'd let it stay like that, for now.  
嗯，他认为结果仍在掌控之中。02 号驾驶员本应在这次战斗中丧生，但她似乎挺了过来，至少目前如此。无论是真嗣的及时赶到，还是她自身异常强大的意志力...总之，她将暂时无法行动，但只要她还活着，就有其存在的意义。他想，暂时就这样吧。

Swiveling around to face his desk, he was about to examine the damages documented by Misato of the two Eva's when he heard a knock on the door and a voice which he loathed every time he heard it.  
他转过身来面对办公桌，正准备查看美里记录的两台 EVA 的损坏情况，这时他听到了敲门声和那个每次听到都让他厌恶的声音。

"Commander...I have the pilot of Unit 01 with me...he-"  
"指挥官...我带着 01 机体的驾驶员...他-"

"Doctor Akagi, I don't have time for such trivial things as baby sitting-"  
"赤木博士，我没时间做这种看孩子的琐事-"

"Shinji says he's ready to dismantle half the base...and take Unit 01 with him..."  
"真嗣说他准备拆掉基地的一半...并带走 01 机体..."

Gendo sat silent for a few seconds. The very idea of a child taking control of Nerv like that was utterly ridiculous, though not improbable. An important person in his life was just hospitalized on the verge death with a possibility of lasting affects. His emotions would be running high and he would act without thought. Maybe it wouldn't hurt, he supposed. He could outline a few things while he was at it.  
源渡沉默了几秒钟。一个孩子那样掌控 NERV 的想法虽然荒谬，但并非不可能。他生命中的一个重要人物刚刚因濒临死亡而被送进医院，可能会有长期影响。他的情绪必然高涨，会不经思考就行动。或许这不会有什么坏处，他想。他可以在过程中提出一些要点。

"Very well, let him in, and be sure that we are not disturbed during this time."  
“很好，让他进来，并确保我们在这段时间内不受打扰。”

"Yes Commander." “是，指挥官。”

Gendo watched as the brass handles on the double door in front of him swung forward, revealing a ashen faced Ritsuko, with Shinji, who looked like he had no problems with what he had threatened to do.  
源堂注视着面前双开门上的黄铜把手向前摆动，露出了面色苍白的律子，以及看起来对自己威胁要做的事毫无悔意的真嗣。

"Leave us Doctor Akagi." “让医生离开，赤木博士。”

Ritsuko simply nodded her head and turned and walked out of the room. It was apparent that she wished that she was anywhere else.  
律子只是点了点头，转身走出了房间。显然，她希望自己此刻能在任何别的地方。

Shinji stood unmoving directly in front of the door. His face was impassive, but a small fire could be seen in his eyes.  
真嗣一动不动地站在门前。他的脸上毫无表情，但眼中却闪烁着一丝火焰。

"Father," Shinji managed to grumble out.  
“父亲，”真嗣勉强咕哝了一声。

Gendo gave no recognition to Shinji's words. He simply gazed at him for a few seconds before he nodded towards a position directly in front of his desk.  
碇源堂对真嗣的话置若罔闻。他只是静静地注视了他几秒钟，然后向办公桌前的位置点了点头。

Taking the hint, Shinji sneered slightly, before he walked forward, and stood in place where Gendo had nodded towards.  
心领神会，真嗣微微嗤笑一声，随即向前走去，站在了源渡点头示意的位置上。

Gendo laid both his elbows on the edge of his desk, wrapped his hands together, and rested his chin on the back of his hands. His usual stance.  
源渡将双肘撑在桌边，双手交握，下巴搁在手背上，这是他一贯的姿势。

Shinji's eyes darted side to side, searching for any sign of movement that might indicate another presence, and though he didn't detect anybody, he was positive that security cameras were watching him.  
真嗣的目光左右扫视，寻找任何可能表明有其他人存在的动静，尽管他没有察觉到任何人，但他确信监控摄像头正注视着他。

Taking several small breaths, he looked at the man before him and said with as much control over his voice as he could muster, "Why did you do that?"  
"他深吸了几口气，尽力控制着自己的声音，看着眼前的男人问道：“你为什么要那么做？””

Gendo looked blankly back at Shinji for several seconds as though he didn't quite understand his question.  
碇源堂面无表情地盯着真嗣看了几秒钟，仿佛不太明白他的问题。

"Did you hear me! I sai-"  
“你听到了吗！我刚说——”

"For the betterment of human kind. It was necessary."  
"为了人类的进步。这是必要的。"

"You're telling me that it was necessary to put Asuka's life at risk!"  
"你是说，让明日香的生命处于危险之中是必要的！"

"Every pilot must shoulder the risk of danger. It is no different for you, or the pilot of Unit 02."  
"每位驾驶员都必须承担危险的风险。对你或二号机驾驶员来说，并无不同。"

"Do you have any idea what kind of state she was in!" Said Shinji, his voice growing louder with each word.  
"你知道她当时是什么状态吗！" 真嗣说道，他的声音随着每个字而变得更大。

"I do not care about such trivial matters. As long as the pilot is able to achieve a successful sync rating, then nothing else is necessary."  
"我对这些琐事不感兴趣。只要驾驶员能够达到成功的同步率，那么其他一切都不重要。"

"She's a living person damn it! She was almost raped! How can you not feel sympathy for her! How can you not care!"  
"她是个活生生的人啊，该死！她差点被强奸了！你怎么能不同情她！你怎么能不在乎！"

"Sympathy does humans no such good. It is simply another emotion that we shall do away with."  
"同情对人类并无益处。它不过是另一种我们应摒弃的情感。"

"But it is what makes us, us!"  
"但正是它定义了我们！"

"Irrelevant. I did not let you enter this office to listen to your complaints. If you continue this I shall have you lea-"  
"无关紧要。我让你进办公室不是来听你抱怨的。如果你继续这样，我就要让你离开了-"

"I'm never piloting Eva again!"  
"我再也不驾驶 Eva 了！"

Gendo seemed to do a double take at that, and his eyes finally settled on Shinji.  
听到这话，源堂似乎愣了一下，目光终于落在了真嗣身上。

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"I said I'm not piloting Unit 01 anymore. I'm done. You disgust me."  
"我说了，我不会再驾驶 01 号机了。我已经受够了。你让我感到恶心。"

"What will you do then? Forsake everything here? Start over? You are running away again."  
"那你打算怎么办？抛弃这里的一切？重新开始？你又在逃避了。"

"I don't care. It doesn't matter. I'm done."  
"我不在乎。无所谓了。我受够了。"

"Not even for the pilot of Unit 02."  
"就连二号机的驾驶员也不在乎了吗？"

"...I didn't say that. I'm taking her with me."  
"...我没那么说。我要带她走。"

"She is property of Nerv and the Japanese Self Defense Forc-"  
"她是 NERV 和日本自卫队的财产-"

"SHE IS NOT AN OBJECT! SHE IS A HUMAN BEING, SHE HAS EMOTIONS. HOW CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT!"  
"她不是物品！她是人，有感情。你们怎么就不明白呢！"

"She is the Second Child, Pilot of Evangelion Unit 02."  
"她是二号适格者，EVA 二号机的驾驶员。"

"SHE'S A PERSON!" "她是一个人！"

"A human, with the role to defend Earth against the invading angels. She has sworn her life to defeat them, or die at the hands of them."  
"一个肩负着保卫地球对抗入侵使徒使命的人类。她誓言要击败它们，或者在它们的攻击下牺牲。"

"THEN HER ENTIRE EXISTENCE IS FOR NOT!"  
"那她的一切岂不是白费了！"

"Is it really? Would she have been better of staying in Germany with her father?"  
"真的吗？她留在德国和父亲在一起会不会更好？"

"No of course not-" "当然不会——"

"Then what would you suggest."  
"那么你有什么建议呢。"

"I don't know...but this is just...too cruel."  
"我不知道...但这实在是...太残忍了。"

"Humans are cruel. Every day thousands die at the hands of others, and why? Its because fundamentality, humans can not understand each other."  
"人类是残忍的。每天都有成千上万的人死于他人之手，为什么？从根本上说，人类无法理解彼此。"

"But I understand her!" “但我理解她！”

"That is simply two people. Try understanding ten billion people. Tell me that is possible."  
“那只是两个人。试试理解十亿人。告诉我那可能。”

"Every human isn't ment to meet each other. There just isn't enough time."  
“并非每个地球人都注定要相遇。只是时间不够。”

"But with Instrumentality it is possible. Every human can understand each other. No hateful emotions-"  
"但借助‘道具化’，这是可能的。每个人都能理解彼此。没有仇恨的情绪——"

"But nothing else either, hate differentiates us too."  
"但也没有其他情感了，仇恨至少让我们有所区别。"

"Which also leads to wars."  
"这也导致了战争。"

"But we learn from wars!"  
"但我们能从战争中学习！"

"And then we repeat the same mistakes years later. We are flawed, and only through Instrumentality can we become perfect."  
"然后几年后我们又重蹈覆辙。我们有缺陷，只有通过工具化才能变得完美。"

"You don't understand..."  
"你不明白……"

"It is you who doesn't understand. You have secluded yourself your entire life, and suddenly you start explaining to me the workings of the human mind. I have studied us as a species for seventeen years, during which I learned that we were created flawed."  
"正是你不懂。你一生都自我封闭，突然间却开始向我解释人心的运作。我研究我们这个物种已有十七年，期间我了解到，我们是被创造出来就有缺陷的。"

"Humans can't be perfect, it isn't in our nature."  
"人类不可能完美，这不是我们的本性。"

"I will make it our nature..."  
"我会让它成为我们的本性……"

"I see there is no point in continuing this. I still stand firm though in my resignation."  
"看来继续下去已无意义。但我仍坚持我的辞职立场。"

"You will be required to submit your ID card to security, and pack your bags, you will not be allowed to enter within one hundred kilometers of Tokyo-3."  
"你需要将身份证交给安保部门，并收拾好行李，你将不被允许进入东京-3 方圆一百公里内。"

"I don't care, I stopped caring long ago."  
"我不在乎，很久以前就不在乎了。"

"Then leave, this conversation is over."  
“那就离开吧，这场对话结束了。”

Shinji ignored him and turned to leave, but suddenly stopped before his hand reached the door. Turning around he looked at Gendo and said, "I talked with mom."  
真嗣无视了他，转身准备离开，但手还未触及门时突然停住了。他转过身，看着源渡说道：“我和妈妈谈过了。”

Gendo who had been looking at the papers on his desk paused and looked up, "Is that so?"  
源渡原本正看着桌上的文件，听到这话停了下来，抬头看向真嗣，“是吗？”

"Yeah, she seemed to be doing fine."  
“是啊，她看起来状态不错。”

What seemed to be a ghost of a smile passed across Gendo's lips, "I see."  
仿佛一丝幽灵般的微笑掠过源渡的唇边，“我明白了。”

Shinji waited to see if he would say anything else, before he turned the handle of the door, and stepped back into the light.  
真嗣等待着看他是否还会说些什么，随后他转动门把手，重新踏入光明之中。

Gendo meanwhile leaned back in his chair, took off his glasses and thought, 'He still has a ways to go...'  
与此同时，源堂靠在椅背上，摘下眼镜，心想：‘他还有很长的路要走...’

---

Shinji slowly trudged along the hallways of Nerv. He had never felt so dejected in his life. He had intended to talk to his father as though they were equals, not as though there was a giant wall separating the two of them. His father had steered the question away from what Shinji wanted, that was his plan all along. Waste his time on pointless discussion while steering away from what Shinji really wanted. He hadn't had a change to talk about the dummy plugs, he briefly mentioned his mom in passing. But what he really wanted to talk about was himself, and that had never seemed more harder than what it had been in those few minutes in his office.  
真嗣缓缓地走在 NERV 的走廊上，他从未感到如此沮丧。他本打算以平等的身份与父亲交谈，而不是像有一堵巨大的墙隔在两人之间。父亲巧妙地避开了真嗣真正想谈的话题，这显然是他的计划。浪费时间在无意义的讨论上，同时避开真嗣真正关心的问题。他没能有机会谈论模拟插入栓，只是顺便提到了母亲。但他真正想谈的是自己，这在办公室的那几分钟里显得比以往任何时候都更加困难。

Who was Shinji really? A boy that had been forsaken by his father? A boy who had finally found something like a parent? A boy who had finally found a close friend, somebody important to him? A boy who had maybe found his place in the world?  
真嗣究竟是谁？一个被父亲抛弃的男孩？一个终于找到了类似父母的人的男孩？一个终于找到了亲密朋友，一个对他来说重要的人的男孩？一个也许找到了自己在世界上的位置的男孩？

...Bullshit. ...胡说八道。

He was abnormal, different, a freak, unnatural, a human guinea pig, a throw away object with no relevance. Or is that how he viewed himself? How did other people view him? Some of them might view him as those things, but others would certainly view him different. His real self, so to speak.  
他是异常的，与众不同的，一个怪胎，不自然的，人类实验小白鼠，一个无关紧要的废弃物。还是说，这就是他看待自己的方式？别人又是如何看待他的呢？有些人可能会把他看作那些东西，但其他人肯定会以不同的眼光看待他。他的真实自我，可以这么说。

And so why did he exist? Was it simply to fight the angels? Is that why he had been brought into this world? That existence was just too depressing. Every human has a reason that they were brought into this world, he just had to find his.  
那么，他为何存在？仅仅是为了对抗天使吗？这就是他被带到这个世界的原因吗？那样的存在太过悲哀。每个人来到这个世界都有其原因，他只需要找到自己的。

And so why did he pilot Evangelion when he truly hated it. Was it praise from his father? To protect the people that were dear to him? A specific someone? How could he still not know after all this time? What had he been doing all this time? His life had never amounted to much so why did he do the things he did. For recognition like Asuka? Because he was told to like Rei? No! He wanted to, but he had no definable reason for it. Maybe it was everything, and maybe it was none of them? Maybe it had something to do with his parents, or his childhood? Maybe it was-  
所以他为何要在明明厌恶的情况下驾驶 EVA 呢？是为了父亲的赞许吗？为了保护他珍视的人们？某个特定的人？经历了这么多时间，他怎么还是不明白？他这些年都在做什么？他的生活从未有过多少意义，那他为何要做这些事？是为了像明日香那样的认可吗？还是因为被要求像对绫波那样？不！他是自愿的，但他没有明确的理由。也许这一切都是原因，也许都不是？或许与他的父母或童年有关？或许——

Something smashed into his shoulders and he was knocked sideways against a wall. Wincing at the pain that hit his shoulder he glanced up just in time to see a nurse with pure panic etched on the features of her face. It looked like she was about to have a heart attack, and Shinji could only guess he was the source.  
有什么东西猛地撞上了他的肩膀，他被撞得侧身撞在墙上。他因肩膀的疼痛而皱眉，抬头时正好看到一位护士脸上刻着纯粹的恐慌。她看起来像是要心脏病发作了，而真嗣只能猜测自己就是原因。

"Oh my God, I'm so sorry...I just..."  
“哦，天哪，真对不起……我只是……”

Shinji shook his head slowly and said, "Its fine...I wasn't looking where I was going anyway. ...Why are you in such a hurry though?"  
真嗣缓缓地摇了摇头，说道：“没事的……反正我也没看路。……不过，你这么急着去哪儿？”

"I got a call from Doctor Akagi. The patient in room 301 seems to have woken up and has exhibited violent behavior."  
“我接到赤木博士的电话。301 号病房的病人似乎醒了，并且表现出暴力行为。”

The room number rang violently in Shinji's ears until he could hear it echoing around is brain.  
301 号房间的数字在真嗣耳中剧烈回响，直到他感觉这声音在脑海中回荡。

Grasping the nurses wrist none to gently he said, "Where is that room number?"  
他毫不温柔地抓住护士的手腕，问道：“那个房间号在哪里？”

"I'm sorry I can't give out-"  
“对不起，我不能透露——”

Shinji applied more pressure to his grasp until he could feel the strain of her muscles.  
真嗣加大了手上的力度，直到他能感觉到她肌肉的紧绷。

Whimpering in pain, the nurse let out a small yelp that was concealed behind a cough. "I-I-I'll show you...just...let go."  
痛苦中发出呜咽，护士在咳嗽声中掩饰了一声小小的尖叫。“我……我会展示给你看……只是……放手。”

Shinji immediately released his grasp on her wrist, and was unsurprised to see a large red mark where his hand had been moments before.  
真嗣立刻松开了她的手腕，看到他刚才握住的地方留下了一块鲜红的印记，对此他并不感到意外。

Nodding towards her, he said, "Get on with it..."  
他朝她点点头，说道：“继续吧……”

He didn't know when he'd have an opportunity like this again.  
他不知道何时还能再有这样的机会。

---

Those shrieks and yells were unmistakably Asuka's thought Shinji as he stood in front of the door. The nurse had gone in moments before during which Shinji was able to see a group of people dressed in white crowded around her table. Shinji had even caught a brief glimpse of her fiery red hair before the door closed in front of him. It was taking all his efforts to not just barge in there and tare everyones head off. Though he figured Asuka had at least bitten a few of them so he thought he should wait. They were only trying to help after all.  
那些尖叫和喊声无疑是明日香的，真嗣站在门前心想。护士刚刚进去，期间真嗣看到一群身穿白大褂的人围在她的桌旁。他甚至瞥见了她火红的头发，随后门就在他面前关上了。他竭尽全力克制自己不要冲进去，把每个人的头都扯下来。不过他想，明日香至少已经咬了他们几个人，所以他决定还是等等。毕竟，他们只是在试图帮忙。

After what seemed like hours he was finally able to enter the room.  
似乎过了几个小时，他终于得以进入房间。

He had expected wires of all sorts connected to her body, and tubes that were for certain utilities, though it seemed that there was none of those, or very few at least.  
他本以为会有各种电线连接着她的身体，以及用于特定功能的管子，但似乎这些都没有，或者至少非常少。

Asuka was sitting up in her bed with a pillow propped behind her head. She seemed to be wide awake enough to recognize him, but he could see the droop in her eyes. He knew that sleep was sometimes difficult to get here, though she was certain to have some type of drug in her body. He knew that she had to receive blood transfusions every hour or so.  
明日香正坐在床上，头靠着一个枕头。她看起来足够清醒，能够认出他，但他能看出她眼皮有些沉重。他知道在这里有时很难入睡，尽管她体内肯定有某种药物。他知道她必须每隔一小时左右接受一次输血。

Walking towards the end of her bed, he sat down next to her feet and said, "How you doing?"  
他走向床尾，坐在她的脚边，问道：“你还好吗？”

"How would you feel if you lost a fourth of the blood in your body? Well, at least there was no scaring."  
"如果你失去了体内四分之一的血液，你会感觉如何？嗯，至少没有留下疤痕。"

'At least she was able to joke about something so serious,' thought Shinji.  
'至少她能对如此严重的事情开玩笑，' 真嗣心想。

"Terrible I'd imagined," mumbled Shinji.  
"我想一定很糟糕，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"As if you needed to reply to that."  
"好像你非得回复那个似的。"

"What happened earlier? I saw that a bunch of doctors and nurses were crowded around your bed."  
"刚才发生了什么？我看到一大群医生和护士围在你的床边。"

"I had a seizure," she replied in an offhanded sort of way.  
"我癫痫发作了，"她漫不经心地回答道。"

"A...what!" "A...什么！"

"I've been having them on and off, its really not that big of a deal."  
"我时不时会有这种感觉，真的没什么大不了的。"

"Yes it is!" "不，这很重要！"

"Shinji, are you going to start freaking out, or am I going to have to call a nurse in to remove you? I don't want to deal with any stress right now."  
"真嗣，你是要开始发疯，还是我得叫个护士来把你弄走？我现在不想处理任何压力。"

"Can't you understand that I've been worried sick. You weren't conscious when I brought you out of that entry plug..."  
"你难道不明白我有多担心吗。我把你从驾驶舱里救出来时，你还没醒..."

Asuka's shoulders seemed to sink as she said, "I know...I heard about how you almost killed just to get to me."  
明日香说着，肩膀似乎沉了下去，"我知道...我听说了你为了救我差点丧命的事。"

"...I didn't know if you would live."  
"...我不知道你是否能活下来。"

"I'm fine, so you can stop threatening people."  
"我没事，所以你可以停止威胁人了。"

Shinji grinned sheepishly at her words, "You heard about that?"  
听到她的话，真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，"你听说了那件事？"

"The doctors were fretting about what would happen to the hospital facilities if you suddenly went on a rampage. Can't say I'd be very impressed if you did that for my benefit. You'd do more damage then good anyway."  
"医生们担心如果你突然暴走，医院设施会怎么样。如果你为了我这么做，我可不会觉得有多好。那样只会弊大于利。"

"Sorry it got spread around, it was more to try to scare my father."  
"抱歉这事传开了，我主要是想吓吓我爸。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"...I talked to him, or, more of he tried to persuade me."  
"...我和他谈了，或者说，是他试图说服我。"

"About what?" "关于什么？"

"Never mind...its not important."  
"算了……不重要。"

"Hmmm," muttered Asuka. "嗯，" 明日香喃喃道。

They lapsed into silence for a while, during which Asuka grabbed a German magazine that she had been reading before Shinji had walked in. Shinji meanwhile was content with simply watching her. After several minutes of this though, Asuka threw her magazine to the side and said, "If you've got something to say, say it!"  
他们陷入了一阵沉默，期间 Asuka 拿起一本之前 Shinji 进来时她正在看的德语杂志。而 Shinji 则满足于只是静静地看着她。然而几分钟后，Asuka 把杂志扔到一边，说道：“如果你有什么要说的，就说出来！”

Shinji hesitated for a second before saying, "What would you say if I told you I was quitting being an Eva pilot."  
Shinji 犹豫了一会儿，然后说：“如果我告诉你我要退出 Eva 驾驶员的身份，你会怎么说？”

"I'd say you were an idiot and a moron but thats nothing new."  
“我会说你是傻瓜和白痴，但这也没什么新鲜的。”

"I'm serious." "我是认真的。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because I-" "因为我不——"

Wait, why did he want to quit? Was it because of his fathers disregard of Asuka? Was it because of the usage of the dummy plug? Was he just tired of people relying on him? But then, wasn't he just running away again?  
等等，他为什么要辞职？是因为他父亲对明日香的不重视吗？还是因为使用了模拟插入栓？或者他只是厌倦了人们依赖他？但那样的话，他岂不是又在逃避吗？

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

"Well thats stupid." "那真是愚蠢。"

"But what do you think?"  
"但你怎么想？"

"Its your decesi-" "这是你的决定——"

"What would you say if I wanted you to...quit with me?"  
"如果我想让你……和我一起退出，你会怎么说？"

Asuka could have fallen out of her hospital bed if it had been a little smaller,  
如果病床再小一点，明日香可能就直接摔下去了，

"Are you serious you idiot," said Asuka while tears started rolling down her cheeks. "You what? Want me to quit piloting the Eva's with you? Are you stupid?"  
"你是认真的吗，你这个白痴，" 明日香说着，泪水开始顺着她的脸颊滚落。"你说什么？要我退出和你一起驾驶 EVA？你疯了吗？"

"Why won't you believe me!"  
"为什么你就是不相信我！"

"Where would we go?" "我们能去哪儿？"

"...I was thinking maybe back to where you used to live, you know, Germany."  
"...我在想或许回到你以前住的地方，你知道的，德国。"

"What part of we could never get involved with Nerv don't you understand? This is my life! Piloting Eva is my life and what I live for, it is part of what defines me as a person."  
"你到底不明白我们绝不能与 Nerv 扯上关系的哪一点？这是我的人生！驾驶 Eva 是我的人生，是我为之而活的东西，它是我作为人的一部分定义。"

"Don't you want to be happy?"  
"难道你不想快乐吗？"

"I am happy!" "我很高兴！"

"I don't believe you!" "我不相信你！"

"Believe what you want! What do you want though Shinji? You always do what other people do. You never do what you believe, you always follow others. If you want me to tell you to stop this, I wont. Its your decision, but I wont follow you. This is my place!"  
"随你怎么想！但你到底想要什么，真嗣？你总是做别人做的事。你从不做自己相信的事，总是跟随他人。如果你希望我叫你停止，我不会。这是你的决定，但我不会跟随你。这是我的立场！"

"Even after this! Even after getting nearly killed because you were nothing more that a throwaway object."  
"即便是在这之后！即便你差点丧命，只因为你不过是个可以随意丢弃的工具。"

Asuka seemed taken aback, and it showed on her face. "They chose me to pilot it instead of you."  
明日香显得有些吃惊，她的表情显露无遗。“他们选择了我而不是你来驾驶它。”

"Because I couldn't pilot it!"  
“因为我无法驾驶它！”

"So they value me as a pilot!"  
"原来他们看重我作为飞行员的价值！"

"You don't understand how my father thinks Asuka. He was using you. If you had died...I think my mind would have broken, I would have turned into a mindless robot."  
"你不懂我父亲是怎么想的，明日香。他在利用你。如果你死了...我想我会崩溃的，变成一个没有思想的机器人。"

"So like the first." "所以像第一个那样。"

"No not like Ayanami. Different, I would have been a human dummy plug.  
"不，不像绫波。不一样，我会是一个人类模拟插件。"

"So you say that your father attempted to have me killed so that he could control you."  
"所以你说你父亲试图杀了我，以便他能控制你。"

"Yes!" "是的！"

"Bullshit! I can't believe that."  
"胡说八道！我无法相信。"

"Why can't you believe that you're the first person that I...connected with."  
"为什么你不能相信我是第一个与你...产生共鸣的人。"

"What is that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"You've said it yourself before Asuka, we are alike. As much as you want to ignore that, the fact is that we both had traumatic childhoods, both our mothers are dead, we've never had or considered the need for friends, and-"  
"你自己也说过，明日香，我们很相似。尽管你想要忽视这一点，但事实是我们都有过创伤的童年，我们的母亲都去世了，我们从未有过或考虑过需要朋友，而且-"

"All right I get it already. But don't expect the same from me, I am my own person.  
"好了，我明白了。但别指望我会和你一样，我是独立的个体。"

"...Why can't you understand-"  
"...为什么你就是不明白-"

"If you thought that you were going to persuade me to leave, you're wrong. I don't care whether you stay or not!"  
"如果你以为你能说服我离开，那你就错了。我不在乎你留不留下！"

Shinji was silent for a few seconds as he continued to gaze back at Asuka. Finally, he slowly slid off the edge of the bed and made his way to the door. Turning around, he glanced briefly over his shoulder at Asuka who had picked up her discarded magazine. Even if they didn't see eye to eye, he still felt that there would always be understanding between them.  
真嗣沉默了几秒，继续凝视着明日香。最终，他缓缓从床边滑下，走向门口。转身时，他短暂地瞥了一眼明日香，她已经捡起了丢在一旁的杂志。尽管他们意见不合，他仍觉得他们之间总会有理解存在。

Giving her a brief smile, he slid the door open, and walked out into the open corridor.  
他向她微微一笑，然后拉开门，走到了开阔的走廊上。

Time seemed to freeze inside the room as soon as Shinji left, and Asuka had not moved an inch since she had picked up her magazine. In truth, she had been rereading the same sentence over and over ever since Shinji had gotten off the edge of her bed, and when he had reached the door, her eyes were straining to look over the magazine while trying to appear that she was still reading.  
真嗣一离开房间，时间仿佛就凝固了，明日香自从拿起杂志后就没有动过一下。实际上，自从真嗣离开她床边的那一刻起，她就在一遍又一遍地重读同一句话，而当他走到门口时，她的眼睛努力透过杂志边缘偷看，同时还要装作仍在阅读的样子。

After several minutes, she slowly let her hands holding the magazine fall to her lap, where the magazine slid off the sleek sheets and fell to the floor. Slowly, she lifted her right hand until her cheek was resting in it.  
几分钟后，她慢慢松开拿着杂志的手，任由它滑落到光滑的床单上，最终掉在地上。她缓缓抬起右手，直到脸颊靠在手掌上。

"Huh?" “啊？”

She drew her hand away from her cheek, surprised that it felt wet. Was she bleeding?  
她从脸颊上抽回手，惊讶地发现手上湿漉漉的。她在流血吗？

"Why am I crying?" “我为什么在哭？”

Sparkling tears glistened on her cheek as they slowly slid down, and rested on her chin. Why would she be crying? She had no reason to.  
晶莹的泪珠在她脸颊上闪烁，缓缓滑落，停留在下巴上。她为何会哭泣？她并没有理由这么做。

"Ah...I see," she mumbled.  
“啊……我明白了，”她喃喃道。

No matter what she said or did, her feelings would always betray her. Why had she said those things to Shinji? She had certainly hurt him. She hadn't meant to, she just couldn't admit that he was right, because then she would have to realize that she was wrong.  
无论她说什么或做什么，她的感情总会出卖她。她为什么要对真嗣说那些话？她确实伤害了他。她并非有意，只是无法承认他是对的，因为那样她就得意识到自己是错的。

She couldn't forsake Eva, no matter hard she tried, or no matter how much she relied on Shinji. It was part of who she was, her body was molded to fit inside her Eva. And yet, she was jealous of Shinji, so much that it hurt to think about him. She both loathed and loved the sight of him. He gave her hope when she couldn't find any, yet she hated him, because he was what she could not be.  
她无法放弃 Eva，无论她多么努力尝试，无论她多么依赖真嗣。这是她的一部分，她的身体已适应了驾驶 Eva。然而，她嫉妒真嗣，嫉妒到一想起来就心痛。她既憎恨又爱慕他的身影。他在她找不到希望时给予了她希望，但她又恨他，因为他代表了那个她无法成为的自己。

Why couldn't she just be honest with him? Was she simply just too prideful? She had wanted to yell at him to take her away from this miserable life, to rid her of the torment of piloting Eva. Her sanctuary had been defiled by the angel, but her mind and her body acted differently. She had been trained so vigorously at the German branch of Nerv that it had become something of a reflex, like a habit. How was she supposed to break something like that?  
为什么她不能对他坦诚相待？是她太过骄傲了吗？她本想对他大喊，带她离开这悲惨的生活，摆脱驾驶 Eva 的折磨。她的避难所被天使亵渎了，但她的思想和身体却做出了不同的反应。她在德国 Nerv 分部接受了如此严格的训练，以至于这成了一种本能，就像一种习惯。她该如何打破这样的束缚呢？

She didn't want Shinji to have to suffer like she had, so she had shunned him. But he was so stupid that he was sure to return...right?  
她不想让真嗣像她一样受苦，所以她疏远了他。但他那么傻，肯定会回来的...对吧？

Maybe not... 也许不会...

What Shinji had said about them being alike, Asuka could never refute that. But because they were able to understand each other, that means that they were able to hurt each other more deeply then the average human relationship. But who was Shinji to Asuka anyway?  
关于他们相似的说法，明日香无法反驳真嗣的话。但正因为能够相互理解，这意味着他们能比普通的人际关系更深地伤害对方。但真嗣对明日香来说究竟算什么呢？

"I don't know," she mumbled as her hands ran over her tear streaked face. "I didn't want this to happen..."  
“我不知道，”她喃喃自语，双手抚过泪痕斑斑的脸庞。“我本不希望事情变成这样……”

---

Shinji was unsure what to do. Should he really leave? Was his father right? Was he simply just running away? But who would care if he did? Asuka had...reacted differently to what Shinji had thought she would have done. He had at least thought she would have told him that she thought that him leaving was completely stupid and that he had to stay and cook for her. He had never expected her to leave with him, but to blatantly tell him that she didn't care whether he stayed or not, that it was completely his decision and that he shouldn't act on what other people say and do. Why couldn't she admit that they needed each other? Was it so hard to admit that fact?  
真嗣不确定该怎么做。他真的应该离开吗？他的父亲是对的吗？他只是在逃避吗？但谁会在乎他是否离开呢？明日香……对真嗣所想的事情反应出乎意料。他至少以为她会告诉他，认为他离开是完全愚蠢的，他必须留下来为她做饭。他从未料到她会和他一起离开，但直截了当地告诉他，她不在乎他是留下还是离开，这完全是他自己的决定，他不应该受别人言行影响。为什么她不能承认他们需要彼此？承认这个事实有那么难吗？

Maybe it was for her.  
或许这是为了她。

Shinji had to remind himself what she had been physically bred to do, and that was pilot Eva. He had never needed training, it had simply come naturally, which he figured had something to do with his exhibition of angel powers. She had certainly gone through rigorous training in Germany, so much that she despised the place. He could understand why she was so adamant on not returning. He couldn't blame her.  
真嗣不得不提醒自己，她被培育出来的身体是为了什么，那就是驾驶 EVA。他从未接受过训练，一切似乎自然而然就掌握了，他猜这可能与他展现出的使徒能力有关。她在德国经历了极其严苛的训练，以至于她憎恨那个地方。他完全理解她为何如此坚决不愿回去。他无法责怪她。

The fact was that she had nowhere else to go in the world, she had been trained for nothing else. What if the angel were finally defeated, what then? Were the Evangelion's and there pilots necessary in a peaceful world devoid of angels? What kind of job would she have in that scenario? Shinji honestly didn't want to think about that, because it felt too cruel.  
事实是，她在世界上无处可去，除了驾驶 EVA，她没有接受过其他训练。如果使徒最终被击败，那又如何？在没有了使徒的和平世界里，EVA 及其驾驶员还有必要存在吗？在那种情况下，她能找到什么样的工作？真嗣真心不想去思考这些，因为这感觉太过残酷。

Why couldn't she completely trust him, no matter what the problem was? She didn't have to fend for herself. They had shared enough that it was simply common sense.  
为什么无论遇到什么问题，她都不能完全信任他呢？她不必独自支撑。他们已经共同经历了那么多，这不过是常识罢了。

Was the shelter and power of the Evangelion the only thing that kept her from collapsing? But after this last battle, how did she feel? She was already in a terrible state because of the attempted rape, and then she had to go and test an Evangelion that she was wholly unfamiliar with. How was one supposed to feel about that?  
是 EVA 的庇护和力量让她免于崩溃吗？但在这场最后的战斗之后，她感觉如何？她已经因为那次未遂的强奸而处于糟糕的状态，然后又不得不去测试一个她完全不熟悉的 EVA。对此，一个人应该有什么样的感受呢？

But what was he supposed to do? Was she being honest when she had said that she didn't care wether he stayed or not? Or was that simply just her pride getting in the way again?  
但他该怎么办呢？她说她不在乎他是否留下时，是真心的吗？还是那只是她的骄傲再次作祟？

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

Shinji froze in mid step and looked around. He had not realized how much he had wandered away from the hospital ward and was surprised to noticed that he was in a completely unfamiliar part of Nerv that he had never entered before.  
真嗣在迈步中僵住了，环顾四周。他没意识到自己已经走得离医院病房那么远，惊讶地发现他来到了一个完全陌生的 NERV 区域，这个地方他以前从未进入过。

Looking around for the voice that called his name, he saw somebody peering out of a glass window to his right. It looked like...  
他四处寻找那个呼唤他名字的声音，看到有人从他右边的一扇玻璃窗向外窥视。看起来像是……

"Kaji...right," Shinji muttered?  
“加持先生……对吧，”真嗣喃喃自语？

What came back was slightly muffled as they were talking through a piece of glass. "Yeah, and I'm surprised to see you over in the investigation department. Hardly anybody every comes here, you least of all."  
透过玻璃传来的声音略显沉闷。“是啊，我也很惊讶会在调查部门见到你。这里几乎没人来，更别提你了。”

"...I was sorta thinking and lost track of time."  
“...我刚才在思考，不知不觉就忘了时间。”

Kaji frowned at him for a moment before he stood and walked over to the door. Opening it he said, "Come on in. You seem to not have anything better to do."  
加治皱眉看了他一会儿，然后起身走向门口。打开门后说道：“进来吧。看来你也没什么更好的事情做。”

Shinji's shoulders slumped slightly as he muttered an almost inaudible, "K'ay."  
真嗣的肩膀微微下垂，低声咕哝了一句几乎听不见的，"好的。"

As Shinji walked into Kaji's office the first thing he understood was that him and Misato had similar habits, in that both seemed to be extremely unorganized. Papers were strewn across a small desk that housed a computer who's keyboard was hidden under a stack of papers. A bulletin board next to the desk on the right showed a detailed map of the world. Shinji noted that it showed the world as it was before Second Impact.  
当真嗣走进加持的办公室时，他首先意识到的是，他和美里有着相似的习惯，那就是两人似乎都非常不整洁。文件散落在一台电脑的小桌子上，键盘被一堆文件掩盖。桌子右侧的布告板上贴着一张世界地图，详细展示了第二次冲击前的世界。真嗣注意到，这张地图显示的是第二次冲击前的世界。

Kaji seemed to notice that Shinji took some interest in the map and said, "Its difficult to find pre Second Impact maps anymore. Almost all of them have been thrown out or redrawn."  
加持似乎注意到真嗣对这张地图有些兴趣，说道："现在很难找到第二次冲击前的地图了。几乎所有的都被扔掉或重绘了。"

"Is that what Antarctica used to look like before Second Impact?"  
"那就是第二次冲击前的南极样子吗？"

"Yeah, it used to be a solid piece of ice, now most of the ice has evaporated though. Do you know much about Second Impact?"  
"是的，以前它是一整块冰，但现在大部分冰都蒸发了。你对第二次冲击了解得多吗？"

"...Just what the teacher taught us at school, which I learned later was wrong."  
"...只是学校老师教的那点东西，后来才知道是错的。"

"Well its not something that the public is supposed to know after all."  
"好吧，毕竟这不是公众应该知道的事情。"

"...So what happened?" "……那么，发生了什么？"

Kaji paused for a minute, before he sat down in the chair in front of his desk and crossed his arms. "Do you know much about Misato's childhood?"  
加持停顿了一下，然后坐在办公桌前的椅子上，交叉双臂。“你对美里小时候了解多少？”

Shinji shook his head. "No, she never talks about herself."  
真嗣摇了摇头。“不，她从不谈论自己。”

"...She never did." “……她从未提起过。”

"What does Misato have to do with Second Impact?"  
“美里和第二次冲击有什么关系？”

"Do you know about the South Pole Expedition team?"  
"你知道南极考察队吗？"

"...No, what is it?" "……不知道，那是什么？"

"A team of scientists that initiated Second Impact. Misato's father was in charge of the expedition."  
"一支科学家团队，引发了第二次冲击。美里她父亲就是那次考察队的负责人。"

"What! They initiated-" "什么！他们启动了-"

"You know about Adam, correct?"  
"你知道亚当的事，对吧？"

"The First Angel, yeah." "第一使徒，是的。"

"Adam appeared in the South Pole during the expedition team. A contact experiment using Adam as the host ensued during which they lost control of the experiment. That is what is known as Second Impact. Misato was only a little kid during this and she witnessed it. She's the only survivor of the team sent down there. Her father died before her eyes, he put her in a capsule and ejected it out to sea. That white cross she wears around her neck all the time, is a memento from her father. The reason she joined Nerv was because she felt that as her fathers daughter, it was her duty to continue on in his legacy, and so she fights the angels in the best way she can. ...As you said, she never likes to talk about herself, though she has a good reason. In fact you seem to be the only person that she's warmed up to in recent years."  
"亚当在南极考察队期间现身。他们以亚当为宿主进行了一次接触实验，结果实验失控，这就是所谓的第二次冲击。那时美里还只是个孩子，她亲眼目睹了这一切。她是被派往那里的团队中唯一的幸存者。她的父亲在她眼前牺牲，将她放入胶囊并弹射入海。她一直戴在脖子上的白色十字架，是她父亲的遗物。她加入 NERV 的原因是，作为父亲的女儿，她觉得自己有责任继承他的遗志，因此她尽其所能地与使徒战斗。...正如你所说，她不喜欢谈论自己，但她有充分的理由。事实上，你似乎是近年来唯一一个让她敞开心扉的人。"

"...What about you and Ritsuko though?"  
"...那你和律子呢？"

"The two of us fell out a long time ago, as for Ritsuko, well, its a professional relationship now days. Enough about us adults though, how do you feel?"  
"我们俩很久以前就闹翻了，至于律子，现在只是职业关系。不过，别再谈我们这些成年人了，你感觉如何？"

Shinji paused for a minute before he said, "What do you mean?"  
真嗣顿了一下，然后问道：“你这是什么意思？”

"You have been under house arrest for over a week now, and Asuka has now been bed ridden, what do you plan to do?"  
“你已经被软禁一个多星期了，而明日香现在卧床不起，你打算怎么办？”

"What do I plan-" “我打算——”

"I heard that you attempted to talk with the commander, and I used attempted because I heard that nothing good came out of it. And so do you really plan on leaving Nerv?"  
"我听说你试图与指挥官交谈，我用‘试图’是因为听说结果并不理想。那么，你真的打算离开 NERV 吗？"

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

"Did you consider how Misato would feel? She would certainly be hurt because of your decision."  
"你考虑过美里会怎么想吗？她肯定会因为你的决定而感到受伤。"

"I talked with Asuka..." "我和明日香谈过了..."

"And what did she say?"  
"她怎么说？"

"...She...didn't care." "...她...不在乎。"

"So what will you do?"  
“那你打算怎么做？”

"...I don't know..." “……我不知道……”

Kaji paused for a moment before he leaned back in his chair. "You know Shinji...you are a lot like myself when I was a kid. I was indecisive, I followed what others did, I didn't think for myself. I couldn't think without somebody else telling me what to do, and just like you, I tried to run away from my responsibilities. Shinji, you may not have realized it, but you have been thrust into the position of adult hood far sooner then most humans, and not just you, Asuka too. You have responsibilities that would make most adults shake in their shoes. You have aged too quickly, and us adults of the old generation must blame ourselves for that. You have become a man Shinji, and so you must make decisions like a man should."  
加治顿了顿，然后靠回椅背上。“你知道吗，真嗣……你小时候和我挺像的。我优柔寡断，总是跟着别人做，不会为自己考虑。没有别人告诉我该怎么做，我就无法思考，就像你一样，我也试图逃避责任。真嗣，你可能没意识到，但你被推到了一个比大多数人更早成年的位置，不只是你，明日香也是。你们的责任重到会让大多数成年人胆战心惊。你们成长得太快了，我们这些老一代的成年人必须为此自责。你已经成为一个男人了，真嗣，所以你必须像一个男人那样做决定。”

"I'm still a kid." "我还是个孩子。"

"Physically yes, but as I said, you have done things that no adult could ever do. You have a burden that no adult could ever carry."  
"从生理上讲是的，但正如我所说，你做了许多成年人无法做到的事情。你承担了一个成年人无法承受的重担。"

"...Are you referring to my-"  
"...你指的是我的——"

"No, nor do I care about what changes you undergo. I still see the same Shinji that I met in Misato's apartment."  
"不，我不在乎你经历了什么变化。我依然看到的是在美里公寓里遇到的那个真嗣。"

"But I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I feel like I'm nothing more than a pawn that gets moved around whenever it suits a person's needs. Why do I pilot Eva?"  
"但我不知道我该做什么。我感觉自己不过是一个棋子，每当有人需要时就随意摆布。我为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Kaji paused for a second before he sighed and shook his head. "I can't answer that Shinji, only you can."  
加持顿了一下，然后叹了口气，摇摇头。"我无法回答你，真嗣，只有你自己能找到答案。"

Shinji suddenly found himself intensely interested in a spot on the wall where the paint seamed to be chipped.  
真嗣突然发现自己对墙上一处油漆剥落的地方产生了浓厚的兴趣。

"If you want my advice though," said Kaji after a few seconds, "I wouldn't leave, it would be irresponsible at this point. A man should finish what he started."  
“不过，如果你想听我的建议，”几秒钟后，加持说道，“我不会离开，在这个节骨眼上离开是不负责任的。一个男人应该完成他开始的事情。”

"But I didn't start this, you grownups did."  
“但我并没有开始这一切，是你们这些成年人开始的。”

"For which we shall never be forgiven, most likely. In our folly, we attempted to usurp the power of God and claim it as our own using science. Now we have to deal with the world as it is. Don't make the same mistake that past generations have made Shinji."  
"我们很可能永远无法被宽恕。在我们的愚昧中，我们试图用科学篡夺上帝的力量，将其据为己有。现在我们必须面对现实的世界。不要重蹈前人的覆辙，真嗣。"

Shinji wasn't sure whether Kaji was with or against him. His advice didn't seem all that helpful to him.  
真嗣不确定加持是支持他还是反对他。他的建议对他来说似乎并不那么有用。

"And with regards to Asuka," said Kaji continuing, "give her some time. In certain aspects, she bears a strong resemblance to a young woman that I used to know a long time ago."  
"至于明日香，"加持继续说道，"给她一些时间。在某些方面，她与我很久以前认识的一位年轻女子非常相似。"

"...I assume you mean Misato."  
"...我想你指的是美里吧。"

"I didn't say that," muttered Kaji.  
"我没那么说，" 加持低声嘟囔道。

Shinji couldn't help it, he chuckled lightly.  
真嗣忍不住轻声笑了出来。

---

"I'm surprised to see that you're not in there with her, considering you've already disobeyed orders and frightened a nurse half to death," said Misato as she walked down the hallway, stopping when she saw Shinji sitting on a chair opposite the door he was starring at.  
"我真惊讶你没在里面陪她，考虑到你已经违抗了命令还差点把护士吓得半死，"美里一边沿着走廊走，一边说道，直到她看到真嗣坐在一扇门对面的椅子上盯着门看。

Turning towards her, Shinji shrugged and said, "Being near is fine for now."  
真嗣转向她，耸了耸肩说："现在待在附近就好。"

"Did you two have another fight?" Asked Misato as she sat down next to him.  
“你们俩又吵架了吗？”美里坐到他旁边问道。

"...No, not like our normals fights, I told her that I planned on quitting Nerv and I asked her to follow me."  
"...不，不是我们平常的打斗，我告诉她我打算离开 Nerv，并邀请她跟我一起走。"

"And she of course refused you."  
"她当然拒绝了你。"

"How did you-" "你怎么知道的-"

"I've known Asuka far longer than you have Shinji, since she was first chosen as the Second Child, and the training that she underwent to accomplish that. She would be throwing five years of her life away if she followed you."  
"我认识明日香比你久得多，从她被选为第二适格者开始，以及她为了达到那个目标所经历的训练。如果她跟你走，那她就是在浪费五年的生命。"

"I suppose." "我想也是。"

"...So? Do you still plan on leaving?"  
"...所以呢？你还是打算离开吗？"

"I still don't know. What is the meaning behind my life if all I'm good for is piloting Eva?"  
"我还是不明白。如果我唯一擅长的就是驾驶 Eva，那我的人生意义何在？"

"Everybody is grateful for what you do Shinji, even the commander."  
"大家都感激你所做的一切，真嗣，即使是指挥官。"

"My father? He doesn't give a damn..."  
"我父亲？他根本不在乎..."

"He just has difficulty showing his emotions."  
"他只是不擅长表达情感。"

"...If he even has any," muttered Shinji.  
"……如果他真有的话，" 真嗣低声嘀咕道。"

The two passed into silence until Shinji blurted something out without meaning.  
两人陷入沉默，直到真嗣无意中脱口而出。

"Misato, what kind of man was your father?"  
"美里，你父亲是个什么样的人？"

The question seemed to catch Misato off guard for a minute because she turned towards him and asked him with a raised eyebrow, "What made you ask that?"  
这个问题似乎让美里措手不及，她转向他，扬起眉毛问道：“你为什么突然问这个？”

"I don't know...my conversation with my father I guess. Its the first I've had since I left home years ago. I had asked Asuka about her family before...but I feel like the answer I got wasn't what I was looking for."  
"我不知道...可能是我和父亲的对话吧。这是我多年来离开家后的第一次。我之前也问过明日香关于她家庭的事...但我觉得我得到的答案并不是我想要的。"

Misato continued looking at him for a minute before she sank back in to her chair. Crossing her legs, she said, "My father...was like yours in some ways. He was always so absorbed in his research that he never had time for me or my mother. I supposed thats why she divorced him eventually."  
美里继续盯着他看了一会儿，然后才坐回椅子上。她交叉双腿，说道：“我父亲……在某些方面和你父亲很像。他总是沉浸在他的研究中，从没有时间陪我和我母亲。我想这就是为什么她最终和他离婚了。”

"Your parents are divorced?"  
“你父母离婚了？”

Misato smiled wanly and said, "I supposed they are, though my father is no longer living."  
美里苦笑了一下，说：“我想他们是离婚了，尽管我父亲已经不在人世了。”

"I'm sorry." "我很抱歉。"

"Its okay, he died doing what he enjoyed."  
"没关系，他是在做自己喜欢的事情时去世的。"

"Did you hate him?" "你恨他吗？"

A long pause ensued, during which Shinji thought that Misato might not have heard his question and was about to open his mouth when she replied, "Yes, I suppose I did. I hated him for the same reasons that you hate your father. I felt that he had abandoned myself and my mother for his research. Though he loved me nonetheless and I found that out during the last few moments of his life. I hate myself for not realizing it sooner. And so I repent, by doing the only thing I see that I can do, by fighting the-"  
一阵漫长的沉默之后，真嗣以为美里可能没听到他的问题，正要开口时，她回答道：“是的，我想我是这样。我恨他的原因和你恨你父亲的原因一样。我觉得他为了研究抛弃了我和我母亲。尽管他依然爱我，我在他生命的最后时刻发现了这一点。我恨自己没有早点意识到。所以我通过做我认为唯一能做的事来忏悔，那就是对抗——”

"Sorry Misato...Kaji already told me some of this."  
“对不起，美里……加持已经告诉我一些了。”

"Wha-" "什-"

"He told me about Second Impact and the South Pole Expedition team."  
“他告诉我关于第二次冲击和南极考察队的事。”

Misato narrowed her eyes and said, "That stupid self conceited bastar-"  
美里眯起眼睛，说道：“那个自以为是的蠢货——”

"Sorry, and I sorta asked, so its my fault as much as his."  
“抱歉，我也有点问了，所以我的错不比他少。”

Misato grimaced and said, "How much did he tell you?"  
美里面露难色，问道：“他跟你说了多少？”

"About the true nature of Second Impact, which also led into your childhood."  
"关于第二次冲击的真正本质，这也牵涉到了你的童年。"

Misato seemed to be relieved about something, because she wiped the sleeve of her shirt across her brow. "I'll have to have a word with that idiot later. So you know that my dad helped start Second Impact."  
美里似乎因为某事松了口气，她用衬衫袖子擦了擦额头。“我晚点得跟那个笨蛋谈谈。所以你知道我父亲参与了第二次冲击的启动。”

"I wouldn't say it like that-"  
"我不会那样说的——"

"The commander was also part of the research team, but he had left a few days early on urgent business. He'd probably be dead if not for that."  
"指挥官也是研究团队的一员，但他因紧急事务提前几天离开了。如果不是那样，他可能已经遇难了。"

"My dad was on the research team?"  
"我爸爸在研究团队里？"

"Yeah, your mother also."  
"是的，你妈妈也是。"

"...I didn't know." "...我不知道。"

"It isn't in the history books. Officially a meteorite struck earth and created Second Impact, but most governments around the world know the true story."  
"历史书上没有记载。官方说法是陨石撞击地球引发了第二次冲击，但世界上大多数政府都知道真相。"

"Why bother hiding it?" "为什么要隐瞒呢？"

"To control the public. If people were to know, mass panic would ensue. Humanity cannot recognize another intelligent being on the planet other than itself."  
“控制公众。如果人们知道真相，将会引发大规模恐慌。人类无法接受地球上存在其他智慧生命。”

"And so you created the Evangelion and chose kids to pilot it."  
“于是你们创造了 EVA，并选择了孩子们来驾驶它。”

Misato hesitated for a second but instead said, "Yes, in essence."  
“Misato 犹豫了一瞬，但还是回答说：“是的，本质上如此。”

"Then its your people's fault that Asuka can't let got of the Evangelion."  
"那是因为你们的人让明日香无法放下《福音战士》。"

"She chose what she would become-"  
"她选择了自己将成为的样子——"

"Because there was no other option available for her!"  
"因为对她来说没有其他选择！"

"Shinji, if you are quitting Nerv in protest of what the commander did, you wont get much sympathy. It was the only other option since the Fourth Child has yet to be found. Rei is only compatible with Unit 00, and you could not pilot."  
"真嗣，如果你因为指挥官的行为而退出 NERV，不会得到太多同情。这是唯一的选择，因为第四适格者尚未找到。零只能与 00 号机兼容，而你无法驾驶。"

"My father made the decision to hurt me and control me!"  
"我父亲决定伤害我并控制我！"

"I don't like it either, but what do you expect me to do about it!"  
"我也不喜欢这样，但你希望我怎么办呢！"

"You're a grownup, you're supposed to be mine and Asuka's guardian, so why don't you take responsibility instead of always shoving it on me!"  
"你是个成年人，应该是我和明日香的保护者，为什么总是把责任推给我，而不是自己承担起来！"

This stung Misato greatly, and she seemed to now be leaning away from Shinji.  
这话深深刺痛了美里，她似乎开始远离真嗣。

"Shinji...Asuka decided this by herself. She knew the possible danger, but she decided to-"  
"真嗣...这是明日香自己的决定。她清楚可能的危险，但她还是决定要..."

"Yet you didn't stop her, as a proper parent would have," Shinji retorted angrily.  
"然而，作为一个称职的父母，你本应阻止她，" 真嗣愤怒地反驳道。

This stung Misato even more, and she finally stood up and turned away from Shinji.  
这话让美里更加难受，她终于站起身来，转身背对真嗣。

"Remember Shinji, if you leave, it will do more harm then good."  
"记住，真嗣，如果你离开，那只会造成更多的伤害而非好处。"

"Thats not for you to decide," he mumbled.  
“这不是你该决定的，”他咕哝道。

Misato sighed and said, "You've had to grow up too quickly, and yet you haven't matured."  
美里叹了口气说：“你不得不太快长大，然而你并未成熟。”

Shinji then turned angrily toward her, only to see that she had started walking away.  
真嗣随即愤怒地转向她，却发现她已经开始走开了。

"Remember Shinji," she called as she continued walking, "Asuka won't be the only one sad if you leave." Turning around, Shinji could see that the corners of her eyes were glistening with tears.  
"记住，真嗣，" 她边走边喊，"如果你离开，不只是明日香会难过。" 转过身，真嗣看到她眼角闪烁着泪光。

"I'd be sad too," she mumbled, before walking deeper into the depths of Nerv.  
"我也会难过的，" 她低声嘟囔，然后继续走向 NERV 的深处。

Shinji continued starring down the empty corridor where Misato had disappeared into for a long time before he turned his head to continue starring at the door that Asuka was behind. He didn't want to talk with her, not now, not after his discussion with Misato.  
真嗣继续盯着米萨托消失的空荡走廊许久，才转过头继续盯着明日香所在的那扇门。他不想和她说话，不是现在，不是在和米萨托谈过之后。

Had he gone too far? Yes, he probably had. Misato had looked after him for the longest time now. She had been the closest thing to a parent that he had experienced, and he had just accused her of being a terrible parent. But she wasn't, she didn't have a clue about who a parent really was. Is that what he was trying to find? Was he trying to find the ideal family?  
他是否走得太远了？是的，他可能确实如此。美里已经照顾他很长时间了。她一直是最接近他父母的人，而他刚刚却指责她是个糟糕的父母。但她并非如此，她对真正的父母是什么样子一无所知。这就是他在寻找的吗？他在寻找理想的家人吗？

"No, that wasn't it," he mumbled.  
“不，不是那样的，”他喃喃自语。

Then was he trying to find the love that his life had always been lacking. Had he tried to supplement Misato as a mother?  
那么，他是在寻找生活中一直缺乏的爱吗？他是否试图将美里作为母亲来弥补？

"...Damn it!" "...该死！"

Shinji kicked the chair that Misato had been sitting on to the side suddenly, his anger getting the better of him. Passing a hand over his eyes, he rubbed them, trying to get a hold of his emotions. What he really needed was to leave this place, but his security card had been taken from him so he couldn't do just that. He could force the gate open if he wanted, but he felt that was a bit excessive. So then how was he supposed...  
真嗣突然一脚将美里坐过的椅子踢到一旁，怒火中烧。他用手揉了揉眼睛，试图平复情绪。他真正需要的是离开这个地方，但他的安全卡已被没收，无法随意离开。如果他想，可以强行打开大门，但他觉得那样太过火了。那么，他该如何是好...

"...Asuka..." "...明日香..."

If he had her card he should be able to get through, the security cameras would set off an alarm though as soon as they saw him leaving. He was willing to take that chance though.  
如果他有她的卡，应该能通过，但安全摄像头一旦捕捉到他离开就会触发警报。不过，他愿意冒这个险。

Standing up, he walked to her door and pressed his ear lightly against the cold wood. He didn't hear anything and hoped that she wasn't sleeping. It wouldn't feel right to take it while she was sleeping, and he knew she'd give him hell for taking it without her permission. But, she might give him hell anyway.  
他站起身，走到她的门前，轻轻将耳朵贴在冰冷的木门上。他什么也没听到，希望她没有在睡觉。趁她睡觉时拿走卡片感觉不对，他知道她会因为他未经允许就拿走卡片而大发雷霆。但无论如何，她可能都会发火。

Grasping the doorknob with his right hand, he turned it quietly and slowly opened the door.  
他用右手握住门把手，悄无声息地转动，慢慢地打开了门。

"About time baka. I was about to call a nurse to yank your ass in here."  
"终于来了，笨蛋。我差点就要叫护士把你拽进来了。"

Shinji was surprised to hear her scornful voice as though she was waiting for him, but even more surprised that, even though her voice was hard, she seemed to be smiling slightly.  
听到她那带着嘲讽的声音，仿佛一直在等他，这让真嗣感到惊讶，但更让他惊讶的是，尽管她的声音严厉，却似乎带着一丝微笑。

"You were...waiting?" "你...在等我？"

"How could I not be with the racket you were making out there?"  
“你在外面闹得那么凶，我怎么可能听不见？”

Shinji grinned sheepishly, "So you heard everything with Misato?"  
真嗣尴尬地笑了笑，“所以你和美里的一切都听到了？”

Asuka crossed her arms and said, "Who couldn't?"  
明日香交叉双臂说道，“谁会听不见呢？”

Shinji was somewhat embarrassed and unsure how he should proceed. He was waiting for Asuka to start yelling at him for some of the things that he had said out there.  
真嗣感到有些尴尬，不确定该如何继续。他在等待明日香开始对他大吼大叫，因为他在外面说的那些话。

"So? I assume you weren't arguing over nothing out there. What have you decided?"  
“所以呢？我想你们在外面不会无缘无故争吵。你们决定好了吗？”

Shinji looked up into Asuka's face and said, "I think I know, but I still need time to think to be sure. I was hoping I could borrow your security card since I can't get leave without one."  
真嗣抬头看着明日香的脸，说道：“我想我知道了，但我还需要时间思考以确保。我希望我能借用你的安全卡，因为我没有它就无法请假。”

"...Do you plan on leaving?"  
"...你打算离开吗？"

"I've been here for over a week, I'd like to get some fresh air and think for a bit."  
"我已经在这里待了一个多星期了，我想出去透透气，思考一下。"

Asuka frowned, "I suppose. Just don't use it for anything perverted."  
明日香皱了皱眉，"我想是的。只是别用它做任何变态的事。"

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

Asuka narrowed her eyes and whispered something that Shinji scoffed at. The security cards that they were given were also used to make purchases. It was like a debit card.  
明日香眯起眼睛，低声说了些什么，让真嗣嗤之以鼻。他们得到的安全卡也被用来购物。就像一张借记卡。

"You should have more faith in me," mumbled Shinji after a few seconds.  
“你应该对我更有信心，”几秒钟后，真嗣咕哝道。

"All boys are the same once you get past everything else."  
“一旦你抛开其他所有，所有男孩都是一样的。”

"Yeah, yeah...so, are you gonna give it to me?"  
“是是...那么，你会给我吗？”

Asuka hesitated for a second but said, "Yeah...I suppose."  
明日香犹豫了一会儿，但还是说：“嗯...我想是的。”

Turning to her right, she opened a drawer next to her bed and drew out a chain with her card attached to it.  
她转向右边，打开床头柜的抽屉，取出一条挂着她卡片的小链子。

"I'll trust you to not lose it, and if you do I expect full compensation."  
"我会相信你不会弄丢它，如果丢了，我要求全额赔偿。"

"Yes, I know," replied Shinji again.  
"是的，我知道。" 真嗣再次回答道。"

"Good, then get going, I'm tired after having to hear yours and Misato's shouting match."  
"好，那就快去吧，听你和美里吵架，我都累了。"

"Right," mumbled Shinji. "嗯，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Turning towards the door, he got maybe a step in before something grabbed a hold of his wrist. Spinning around, he saw Asuka looking at him forlornly with her bottom teeth biting down on her lower lip.  
他转向门口，刚迈出一步，手腕就被什么东西抓住了。他转过身，看到明日香带着悲伤的眼神看着他，下唇被下齿轻轻咬住。

"If you leave, I won't forgive you," she whispered.  
"如果你离开，我不会原谅你，" 她低声说。

Shinji froze for a second and looked back at her. He wanted to stay...but no, this felt too important to ignore. Simply nodding, he slid his wrist out of Asuka's grasp, and walked out the door.  
真嗣愣了一秒，回头看向她。他想留下来...但不行，这件事感觉太重要了，不能忽视。他只是点了点头，从明日香的手中抽出手腕，走出了门。

The hand that had briefly held Shinji's wrist hung limply at Asuka's side before she brought it up to her face and pressed the back of it lightly against her left cheek.  
那只曾短暂握住真嗣手腕的手无力地垂在明日香身侧，随后她将手举到脸前，轻轻地将手背贴在左颊上。

"Baka," she mumbled, before she rolled over onto her stomach, buried her face in her pillow and tossed the sheets over her head.  
“笨蛋，”她咕哝着，然后翻身趴下，把脸埋在枕头里，把床单拉过头盖住自己。

### Chapter 16: Horrors
第十六章：恐怖

**Sorry about the wait for this. It was originally supposed to come out on Valentines Day, but I get sick and basically wasn't in the mood to do much typing till a week ago, which in hindsight is properly good, since this is a very unvalentines day chapter. Anyways to make up for that I've got something special today. I'm posting two chapters today...why you ask. Because I just turned twenty today. Yeah its my birthday, party crackers for all. Anyway its late so I'm gonna post this and the other in a bit and go to sleep. Can't wait till...later I guess since it is tomorrow. Gonna go to the Oliver Garden (italian restaurant for those of you that don't know, not sure if its in another parts of the US besides Oregon)  
抱歉让大家久等了。原本计划在情人节发布的，但我生病了，基本上直到一周前都没心情打字，现在看来这倒是件好事，因为这一章非常不符合情人节的氛围。为了弥补这一点，今天我准备了一些特别的内容。今天我会发布两章...你问为什么？因为今天我二十岁了。没错，是我的生日，大家一起来庆祝吧。不管怎样，现在已经很晚了，我打算一会儿就发布这两章然后去睡觉。迫不及待想等到...明天再说吧，毕竟已经是今天了。打算去奥利弗花园（一家意大利餐厅，不知道除了俄勒冈州外美国其他地方有没有）。**

---

Shinji was moving fast, in fact, faster then he had probably ever moved in his life. Chances are, if anybody saw him running like this through the corridors of Nerv, he'd be pulled aside instantly. He had managed to avoid most of the security cameras, at least so far. He knew that every gate leading in and out of Nerv had at least three security cameras, giving a complete three hundred and sixty degree view. As long as he could make it there and leave, he should be fine.  
真嗣跑得飞快，实际上，可能比他一生中任何时候都要快。如果有人看到他在 NERV 的走廊里这样狂奔，很可能会立刻被拦下。他设法避开了大部分的监控摄像头，至少到目前为止是这样。他知道，每个进出 NERV 的门至少有三台监控摄像头，提供全方位的三百六十度视角。只要他能赶到那里并离开，应该就没事了。

He still didn't know what he would do though when he left, and thats what was nagging at him. Where exactly should he go? He could walk some of the trails that he used to walk before he met Asuka and Misato, but for some reason, he didn't want to remember those painful times of loneliness. He just needed to leave, leave and think, for thats what Asuka had risked her security card for.  
然而，他仍然不知道离开后该做什么，这才是让他心烦意乱的原因。他到底该去哪里？他可以走一些以前和明日香、美里相遇之前常走的小径，但不知为何，他不想回忆那些孤独的痛苦时光。他只是需要离开，离开并思考，这就是明日香冒着风险用她的安全卡让他离开的原因。

He hoped she wouldn't get in too much trouble, Misato would probably glaze over the small misdemeanor. Shinji knew that letting other Nerv employee's know your security code on the back of your card was subject to confinement for up to three days. But surely it wouldn't count as much. Besides, Asuka could just lie and tell them he took it while she was sleeping. They'd believe it well enough with the current state of affairs.  
他希望她不会惹上太多麻烦，美里大概会对此小过失视而不见。真嗣知道，让其他 NERV 员工知道你卡背面的安全密码可能会被关押长达三天。但这次应该不会算得太严重。况且，明日香完全可以撒谎说他是趁她睡觉时偷看的。以目前的情况来看，他们很可能会相信。

Pausing at the corner of a four way intersection of hallways, Shinji looked around a corner for a brief instance. After catching his breath, and being sure that nobody had seen him, person or camera, he took off in another full sprint.  
在四向走廊的拐角处停下，真嗣迅速瞥了一眼角落。喘了口气，确认无论是人还是摄像头都没发现他后，他又全力冲刺起来。

The gate he was headed for was the closest from the Nerv hospital, in fact, it had been built especially for the sake of bringing injured people straight from downtown Tokyo-3, which was where he was headed.  
他前往的那扇门离 NERV 医院最近，实际上，它就是为了方便将伤员直接从市中心的第三新东京市运送过来而特别建造的。

Finally reaching the elevator that would take him up to the gate, he peaked around the corner briefly, only to jerk his head back to its starting place.  
终于走到通往登机口的电梯前，他迅速探头看了一眼拐角处，随即又猛地将头缩回原位。

"Shit," he mumbled. He had forgotten that there was a camera placed precariously above the elevator.  
“该死，”他低声咒骂。他忘了电梯上方有个摄像头。

Looking around the corner again, he weighed his chances of running straight towards the elevator and being spotted. He supposed he could, and risk security spotting him and forcing a lock down on gate five, which he was just under, or he could...  
再次探头观察，他权衡着直接冲向电梯并被发现的概率。他想，他可以冒险一试，可能会被安保人员发现并导致五号登机口紧急封锁，而他就在附近；或者他可以选择……

'Practice makes perfect,' he thought.  
“熟能生巧，”他心想。

Pressing himself flat against the corner of the wall, he then griped the corner of the wall with his right hand in preparation. In truth, he had no idea whether this would work or not. Whenever he had used his AT-field before, the object of his thought had always been within reaching distance. The camera had to be a good ten meters away though.  
他紧贴着墙角，右手牢牢抓住墙角准备着。实际上，他并不确定这招是否有效。以往使用 AT 力场时，目标总是近在咫尺。但那台摄像机却远在十米之外。

Glancing around the corner, he saw the camera swiveling left and right as it covered the corridors on either side of it, not just the one in front which Shinji was on. Reacting quickly as it moved towards the left, temporarily loosing sight of the middle hallway, Shinji swung his right arm up in a straight arc directed at the camera. At the same time, he thought repeatedly in his head, 'Slice it, Slice it, Slice it!'  
"他瞥了一眼墙角，看到摄像机左右转动，覆盖着两侧的走廊，不仅仅是他所在的那一侧。当摄像机转向左侧，暂时失去了对中间走廊的视线时，真嗣迅速挥起右臂，划出一道直线，直指摄像机。与此同时，他在脑海中反复默念：“切断它，切断它，切断它！”

Shinji felt it before he heard the shattering of the camera and its subsequent fall to the floor. Something which could only be described as what felt like another layer of skin that molded perfectly with his body, shot outwards before changing into a straight line in mid air. The camera lens was split directly in half along with the supports that mounted it to the wall.  
在听到相机破碎和随之坠地的声音之前，真嗣就已经感受到了。一种仿佛是与身体完美贴合的另一层皮肤的东西，突然向外射出，在半空中变成了一条直线。相机镜头连同固定在墙上的支架一起，被直接劈成了两半。

Shinji opened his eyes, just as the camera hit the floor, and shattered into a few more pieces. It may be the pinnacle of surveillance equipment, but its still as fragile as glass.  
就在相机落地并碎成更多碎片的那一刻，真嗣睁开了眼睛。尽管这是监控设备的巅峰之作，但它依然像玻璃一样脆弱。

Trying not to revel in this sudden new surprise at what he was capable of doing, Shinji quickly hurried down the rest of the corridor, punched in the numbers that would take him to the surface, and stepped into the elevator.  
真嗣努力不让自己沉浸在这突如其来的新能力带来的惊喜中，他迅速穿过剩下的走廊，输入了通往地面的数字，然后走进了电梯。

...Meanwhile in a security room not to far from the elevator Shinji had just entered...  
...与此同时，在离电梯不远的安保室内，真嗣刚刚进入...

"Strange..." mumbled the guard. "Camera twenty-two suddenly went silent."  
"奇怪..." 保安喃喃自语，"二十二号摄像头突然没信号了。"

"What happened?" Replied the other.  
"发生什么事了？" 另一人回应道。"

"I don't know but...wait...somebody is in the elevator leading to gate number five."  
"我不知道，但是...等等...有人进了通往五号门的电梯。"

"Unauthorized?" "未经授权？"

"Seems to be that way."  
"看起来是这样。"

"Better call it up then."  
“那就赶紧打个电话吧。”

---

Misato had certainly lived through better days then the ones she was currently experiencing. She couldn't believe that she had her first fight with Shinji. Sure they had argued a few times, but she had never seen such loathing in his eyes as he berated her about being a bad parent. Did he honestly expect her to be happy with the current situation? Of course she hated it, but she had tried her best!  
美里确实经历过比现在更好的日子。她无法相信自己竟然和真嗣发生了第一次争吵。当然，他们有过几次争执，但她从未见过他眼中如此的憎恶，当他斥责她是个糟糕的父母时。他真的期望她对当前的状况感到满意吗？她当然讨厌这一切，但她已经尽力了！

Turning away from the stack of papers that sat on her desk, she swiveled around in her chair, placed her elbows on her knees, and rested her chin in her hands.  
她转过身，从桌上的那堆文件中抽离视线，旋转椅子，将手肘撑在膝盖上，双手托着下巴。

By having Shinji and Asuka living with her, was she trying to act out the position of being a parent? What was a guardian then? Some form of authority at its most basics most likely. Shinji and Asuka were just too young to live by themselves, no matter how much either desired it.  
通过让真嗣和明日香与她同住，她是否在试图扮演父母的角色？那么监护人又是什么呢？最基本的，可能是一种权威形式。无论真嗣和明日香多么渴望独立，他们毕竟还太年轻，无法独自生活。

She had never seriously thought of having kids before, it had always seemed something from another world. Certainly she had wondered what it would be like as any young adult woman does, but that was when she had been in college, and still clueless about the workings of the world. And yet, there had been times with Kaji when she had thought what raising a family would have been like with him. But neither of them could have handled that sort of responsibility. Now she was wondering if she could even handle two teenagers.  
她从未认真考虑过要孩子，这似乎总是另一个世界的事情。当然，像所有年轻女性一样，她也曾好奇过那会是什么感觉，但那是在大学时期，她对世界的运作仍一无所知。然而，与加持在一起的某些时刻，她曾幻想过与他共同抚养家庭的情景。但两人都无法承担那样的责任。现在，她不禁怀疑自己是否能应付两个青少年。

She felt ashamed of saying it, but when she had learned about the probability of Shinji having angel powers, she felt scared of him. She now realized how wrong that had been, and how it had affected Shinji. Shinji and Asuka had there ups and downs, no use denying it. But she had always been there and supported him. But when she became afraid of what he might be, she shunned him. Because of that, he seemed to resent her, and blamed her because of what happened to Asuka.  
她为自己说出这样的话感到羞愧，但当她得知真嗣可能拥有天使之力时，她对他感到恐惧。现在她意识到那有多么错误，以及它对真嗣的影响。真嗣和明日香有过起起落落，否认这一点毫无意义。但她一直都在那里支持着他。然而，当她开始害怕他可能成为的样子时，她疏远了他。正因为如此，他似乎怨恨她，并因明日香发生的事情而责怪她。

"But it wasn't my fault," she whispered with her face now resting in her hands. "I took every precaution available, I tried to have the commander change pilots or choose the fourth. I tried!"  
“但那不是我的错，”她将脸埋在双手中低声说道，“我采取了所有可用的预防措施，我试图让指挥官更换驾驶员或选择第四位。我尽力了！”

Misato suddenly jumped in her chair, startled as the phone on her desk rang amongst the many papers and documents. Turning towards her desk, she shifted some of the papers out of the way, only to stare at the number on the phone. If she remembered correctly six, seven, one, was the area code for a guard post stationed just before the gate leading to downtown Tokyo-3.  
美里突然从椅子上跳了起来，被桌上的电话铃声吓了一跳，电话周围堆满了文件和纸张。她转向桌子，挪开一些文件，只是盯着电话上的号码。如果她没记错的话，六、七、一是位于通往第三新东京市市中心大门前的一个警卫哨所的区号。

Picking it up hesitantly, she said, "This is Major Misato..."  
她犹豫地拿起它，说道：“这是美里少校……”

"Major, we have a security breach over here at gate five, one of our security cameras was taken out, and the suspect is traveling up the elevator."  
“少校，我们在五号门这里发生了安全漏洞，其中一个监控摄像头被破坏了，嫌疑人正乘坐电梯上行。”

"Initiated the automatic shutdown of the elevator."  
“已启动电梯自动关闭程序。”

"We can't, the person must be a Nerv employee because he overrode the emergency shutdown access code."  
"我们做不到，那个人必须是 NERV 的员工，因为他重写了紧急关机访问码。"

"Force a lockdown on gate five."  
"强制封锁五号门。"

"We wont make it in time."  
"我们来不及了。"

"Damn it! Did the camera get a shot of the intruder before it was taken out?"  
"该死！摄像头在被破坏前拍到了入侵者的照片吗？"

"No, all we were able to see was a single frame in the video where it showed a flash of orange light before the camera was destroyed."  
"没有，我们只能看到视频中的一帧，显示了一道橙色闪光，随后摄像头就被摧毁了。"

"What!" “什么！”

"Is something wrong Major?"  
"有什么问题吗，少校？"

Misato bit her tongue for a second before she said, "Put me through to the hospital, ward number eleven, and let me know when the suspect passes through the gate. At most we'll be able to know who it is with their security card."  
美里咬了咬舌头，片刻后说道：“接通医院十一号病房，并在我知道嫌疑人通过大门时通知我。我们最多能通过他们的安全卡知道是谁。”

"Very well Major." “遵命，少校。”

Misato heard the click as the guard disconnected and the beeping, as she was connected to the hospital ward. She had a feeling who was leaving via gate number five, but wanted to be sure. The gate was after all closest to the hospital."  
美里听到警卫挂断的咔嗒声和接通医院病房的嘟嘟声。她有种预感是谁从五号门离开，但想确认一下。毕竟，那扇门离医院最近。

Finally a female voice came on the phone and said, "Nerv hospital, ward number eleven, how may I help you."  
终于，电话那头传来一个女性的声音，说道：“这里是 NERV 医院，十一号病房，有什么可以帮您的？”

"This is Major Misato. Put me through to room 301, and make it quick!"  
“我是美里少校。给我接 301 号房间，快点！”

"At once, Major." “马上办，少校。”

After several seconds, Misato heard a click and Asuka's voice as she answered the phone.  
几秒钟后，Misato 听到了一声咔嗒声，接着是 Asuka 接电话的声音。

"Yes, what is it," Asuka grumbled slightly?  
“是的，什么事，”Asuka 略带不悦地咕哝道？

"Asuka, its Misato." “Asuka，是我，Misato。”

"Is something wrong?" "有什么不对劲吗？"

"Is Shinji with you?" "真嗣和你在一起吗？"

"No, he's not. Should he be?"  
"没有，他不在。他应该在吗？"

"I think he might have left and just thought you might know whether he had left or not?"  
"我觉得他可能已经离开了，只是想你可能知道他是否真的走了？"

"Wouldn't you find that out faster then I would considering I'm stuck here," said Asuka with a slight hint of amusement in her voice.  
"考虑到我被困在这里，你不是应该比我更快知道吗？" 明日香带着一丝戏谑的语气说道。

"Asuka! Did Shinji tell you he was leaving!"  
"明日香！真嗣有没有告诉你他要离开！"

There was a slight pause before Asuka replied, "Whatever he decides to do if he leaves is entirely up to him."  
在回答之前，明日香稍稍停顿了一下，“无论他离开后决定做什么，都完全取决于他自己。”

"Damn it Asuka! Did you give him your pass card, because if you did I-"  
“该死的明日香！你是不是把你的通行卡给他了，如果是的话我——”

"Court martial me? Not likely since I'm an Eva pilot."  
“要军事法庭审判我吗？不太可能，毕竟我是 Eva 驾驶员。”

"Asuka do you realize what you've done?"  
"明日香，你知道你做了什么吗？"

"...Its not like he's going to do anything that would put Nerv in a bad position."  
"……他又不会做出什么让 NERV 陷入不利境地的事。"

"But he may never come back! Surely you realize that!"  
"但他可能永远都不会回来了！你肯定明白这一点吧！"

"No, he will come back."  
"不，他会回来的。"

"How can you be so sure-"  
"你怎么能这么肯定——"

"Because I believe him," replied Asuka with such a strong voice that Misato had to pause several seconds before replying, "How can you be sure though?"  
"因为我相信他，" 明日香用如此坚定的声音回答，使得美里不得不停顿了几秒钟才回应，"可你怎么能确定呢？"

Misato thought she caught a slight laugh in Asuka's reply as she said, "Because he knows that I'd find him no matter where he went on this planet and give him hell for breaking his promise to me."  
美里觉得她在明日香的回答中捕捉到了一丝轻笑，她说：“因为他知道，无论他在这个星球上的哪个角落，我都会找到他，并因为他违背了对我的承诺而让他吃尽苦头。”

Misato was silent for almost a thirty-seconds before Asuka said quietly, "He'll be back. Maybe not tomorrow...or the day after, but he will be, because he knows I'm waiting for him."  
美里沉默了近三十秒，然后明日香轻声说道：“他会回来的。也许不是明天……或者后天，但他会的，因为他知道我在等他。”

"...Asuka..." "...明日香..."

"Sorry Misato but I'm still tired, so if we're done, I'd like to get back to sleep."  
“抱歉，美里，但我还是很累，所以如果我们谈完了，我想回去睡觉。”

"Asuka you realize that if Shinji doesn't return...then you really _could_ face the possibility of a court martial."  
"明日香，你意识到如果真嗣不回来...那么你真的可能面临军事法庭的审判。"

"Good, then I'd have all the time in the world to find that idiot."  
"好啊，那样我就有全世界的时间去找那个白痴了。"

Asuka hung up without another word, leaving Misato with nothing but the ringing of Asuka's last words in her ears.  
明日香没再说一句话就挂断了电话，留下美里耳边回荡着她最后的话语声。

Hanging the phone up, she saw the light flashing on and off her answering machine and pressed it. Predictably, it had been the guard that had talked to her earlier and he described the portrait of the person leaving Nerv. Though he was puzzled as the security card rang up something different then what the cameras had shown. After a minute of his lengthly description, Misato pressed the hang up button and leaned back in her chair.  
挂断电话后，她注意到答录机上的指示灯在闪烁，便按下了播放键。不出所料，是之前与她通话的警卫，他描述了离开 NERV 的人的肖像。尽管他感到困惑，因为安全卡显示的信息与摄像头捕捉到的画面不符。在他的冗长描述后，美里按下了挂断键，靠回椅背上。

She felt like she had failed not only Asuka, but now Shinji also as a guardian.  
她觉得自己不仅在监护阿斯卡方面失败了，现在连真嗣也未能尽到监护人的责任。

---

Even the stale air of Tokyo-3 never smelled so sweet as it did now that Shinji finally made it out into the open air. Stretching his legs to the point where he could feel his underused muscles cramping up, he threw his arms behind his head and gazed up into the blue sky of Tokyo-3. It had been...what, over a week since he saw blue skies? No, longer than that, since it had been raining those past few days before he had been taken to Nerv.  
即使是东京-3 那陈腐的空气，此刻也从未如此甜美，因为真嗣终于走出了封闭的空间，呼吸到了新鲜空气。他伸展双腿，直到感到久未使用的肌肉开始抽搐，然后将双臂枕在脑后，仰望东京-3 的蓝天。已经……多久没见过蓝天了？不，比那更久，因为在被带到 NERV 之前的那几天一直在下雨。

'Now...what to do," he wondered?  
'现在...该做什么呢，'他思索着？

Starting off in a walk that was unsure of its final destination, he let his feet take him wherever they wanted to go while his mind wandered.  
他开始漫无目的地走着，任由双脚带他去任何它们想去的地方，而思绪则四处游荡。

First then...why did he pilot?  
首先...他为什么要驾驶呢？

'Because I'm told to,' said a voice in his head.  
‘因为这是命令，’他脑海中有个声音说道。

'No...thats not right.' ‘不……这样不对。’

'But people expect you to, because you have talent.'  
‘但人们期望你这么做，因为你有天赋。’

'So they push there own responsibilities and desires onto me.'  
'所以他们把自己的责任和欲望都推给我。'

'Why do you loath contact between other humans?'  
'你为什么厌恶与其他人的接触？'

'Because nobody loves me. They only care about themselves.'  
'因为没有人爱我。他们只关心自己。'

'So you pilot to acquire the love that was missing in your life?'  
'所以你驾驶飞船去寻找生活中缺失的爱？'

'No! Thats not it!' '不！不是那样的！'

'What do you wish for? What does your heart desire?'  
'你渴望什么？你的心究竟向往什么？'

'I don't know.' '我不知道。'

'Why don't you know?' '你为什么不知道？'

'I don't know! I don't know what love feels like because I've never been loved!'  
'我不知道！我不知道爱是什么感觉，因为我从未被爱过！'

'What about Misato? Asuka? Rei? What do you feel for them?'  
'那美里呢？明日香？丽？你对她们有什么感觉？'

'They...I don't know.' '她们...我不知道。'

'You don't want to know...because you're afraid of being hurt.'  
'你不想知道...因为你害怕受到伤害。'

'Stop it!' '别这样！'

These last words Shinji blurted out into the open air. Looking wildly around for a minute, he realized he had come a good ways from gate five. Glancing towards his left and right, he tried to place where he was with the map of Tokyo-3 that resided in his head. Whatever his grades looked like, he always seemed to memorize things easier then most people.  
这最后几句话，真嗣脱口而出，飘散在空气中。他疯狂地环顾四周片刻，意识到自己已经从五号门走出了很远。他左右张望，试图根据脑海中东京-3 的地图确定自己的位置。不管成绩如何，他总是比大多数人更容易记住事情。

There was a shop on his left that looked as though it had come right out of the 1800's, while on his right there seemed to be a small cafe of some sort. Hesitating briefly, his grumbling stomach won over his common logic, and he crossed the street, and walked in.  
他左边有一家店铺，看起来像是直接从 19 世纪搬来的，而右边则似乎是一家小咖啡馆。犹豫片刻后，他咕咕作响的肚子战胜了理智，于是他穿过街道，走了进去。

It seemed even smaller then what he had seen outside. Upon walking into the small shop, the first thing he saw was the wooden counter that ran along in half a circle. Seated behind it was a woman, a little older than him that had dark brown hair streaked with a darkened red. She was reading a book of sorts and Shinji understood that to mean that this place rarely got any customers.  
走进这家小店，它似乎比从外面看还要小。首先映入眼帘的是一个半圆形延伸的木制柜台。坐在柜台后面的是一位女士，比他稍长几岁，深棕色的头发中夹杂着暗红色。她正在阅读一本书，这让真嗣明白这个地方很少有顾客光临。

Seated next to the windows directly to the left and right of him were several small wooden tables with one or two chairs around them. A few of them even had a small glass vase with flowers in them, attempting to improve the look of the place. Several hanging fans with light fixtures spun above him and blew cool air into his face, as if he had needed it. The walls were mostly bare and devoid of pictures or paintings except for a rather dull looking picture of a cup of coffee that was placed behind the wooden counter. Shinji couldn't understand how this place was still in business.  
直接坐在他左右两侧的窗户旁，有几张小木桌，每张桌子周围有一两把椅子。其中几张桌子上甚至放着一个小玻璃花瓶，里面插着花，试图改善这个地方的外观。几盏带有灯饰的吊扇在他头顶旋转，吹来凉风拂面，仿佛他真的需要这股凉意。墙壁大多光秃秃的，没有图片或画作，除了柜台后面挂着的一幅相当乏味的咖啡杯画。真嗣无法理解这家店是如何维持生意的。

Walking up to the counter, he got a closer look at the girls face and realized that she wasn't all that bad looking. He suddenly felt a chill down his spine though and seemed to think that he had just angered somebody greatly. It was a ridiculous thought, and besides, its not like he was tied down or anything.  
走到柜台前，他更清楚地看到了女孩的脸，意识到她其实并不难看。然而，他突然感到一阵寒意顺着脊梁骨而下，似乎觉得自己刚刚大大地惹恼了某人。这想法很荒谬，而且，他又没有被束缚住什么的。

Seeing that she had a customer, the girl put down her book, and walked up to the register.  
看到有顾客来，女孩放下手中的书，走到收银台前。

"What can I get you?"  
“您要点什么？”

Shinji was rather taken aback at the tone of her voice as it was quite clear that she didn't enjoy being interrupted in the middle of reading. Whats more though, the tone and inflection reminded him strongly of somebody else.  
真嗣对她的语气感到相当意外，显然她不喜欢在阅读中途被打断。更甚的是，这种语调和抑扬顿挫让他强烈地想起了某个人。

"Well?" She asked again, this time with a raised eyebrow.  
“嗯？”她再次问道，这次挑起了眉毛。

"Sorry," Shinji mumbled. Glancing at the menu, he didn't feel as though his stomach had any preference today and just went with two deli sandwiches and a small cola.  
“对不起，”真嗣咕哝着。瞥了一眼菜单，他觉得今天胃里没什么特别偏好，于是随便点了两个熟食三明治和一小杯可乐。

The girl was unsociable as she rang up Shinji's order, and retreated to the back of the cafe to get his food. Shinji was honestly wondering how fresh a sandwich could be if it was kept in the back of a cafe.  
女孩在为真嗣结账时显得很不合群，随后退到咖啡馆后部去取他的食物。真嗣真心怀疑，如果三明治放在咖啡馆后部，它还能有多新鲜。

Returning to the front of the cafe, the girl placed the wrapped sandwich and turned to fill Shinji's cup of cola. After filling it to the brim, she turned to Shinji and said in a crass voice, "Five seventy-five."  
回到咖啡馆前台，女孩将包装好的三明治放下，转身去给真嗣的可乐杯加满。倒至杯口后，她转向真嗣，用粗鲁的语气说：“五美元七十五美分。”

Shinji had completely forgotten about paying for his meal and winced again, as another cold streak ran down his spine. Hesitating, unsure of how he should proceed, he heard a small voice in his head say, 'Go ahead and use the card, its not like this is wrong or anything.'  
真嗣完全忘记了付账的事，再次打了个寒颤，又一股寒意顺着脊梁骨而下。犹豫不决，不知该如何是好，他听到脑海中有个细小的声音说：“用卡吧，这又没什么不对的。”

'But I feel bad, using Asuka's card for food,' he replied back.  
'但我用明日香的卡买食物，感觉不太好，' 他回复道。

'What will you do then, starve?'  
'那你打算怎么办，饿肚子吗？'

Thankfully, Shinji's reply was unnecessary as the girl at the counter said, "Are you paying or what!"  
幸运的是，真嗣的回复变得多余，因为柜台的女孩催促道：“你到底付不付钱！”

Pulling Shinji out of his reprieve, he glanced at her and saw contempt on her face. He had a sudden surge of annoyance that he had not felt in some time course through him.  
将真嗣从短暂的解脱中拉回现实，他瞥了她一眼，看到她脸上的轻蔑。一股久违的恼怒突然涌上心头。

'Cool it,' he reminded himself. 'Flying off the handle now would only make matters worse.'  
“冷静点，”他提醒自己，“现在发脾气只会让事情更糟。”

So, calming himself down, he muttered, "Right, sorry," and fished Asuka's security card out of his pocket.  
于是，他努力平复心情，低声说道：“好吧，抱歉。”然后从口袋里掏出了明日香的安全卡。

Either the girl didn't bother to check the picture or name on the card when she swiped it through the slot, or she simply didn't care, because it only left Shinji's hand for three seconds.  
要么是那女孩懒得检查卡片上的图片或名字就刷过了插槽，要么她根本不在乎，因为卡片只在真嗣手里停留了三秒钟。

Depositing the card in his pocket, he turned with his food in hand and without another glance, started walking towards the door, though something held him back. Turning suddenly to his right, and not quite sure what he was doing, he walked over the table in the farthest corner of the right wall, and sat himself down in a chair facing the window.  
他将卡片塞进口袋，手里端着食物转身离开，没有再多看一眼，径直朝门口走去，但某种东西让他停下了脚步。突然转向右边，不太确定自己在做什么，他走到右墙最远处的桌子旁，坐了下来，面朝窗户。

It took him a few seconds to realize that he was still inside the cafe, and he couldn't understand why his feet had suddenly decided to take a detour. Was his subconscious telling him to stay here? That was certainly stupid.  
他花了好几秒钟才意识到自己还在咖啡馆里，不明白为什么双脚突然决定绕个弯。难道是他的潜意识在告诉他留在这里？这想法确实很蠢。

'Fuck it,' he thought. '去他妈的，' 他心想。

Unwrapping his sandwich, he glanced up briefly at the counter, only to see that the girl had sat back down on her stool with her book back in her hand. It seemed she wasn't pleased with Shinji's sudden decision, as her eyebrows seemed to have come together. Well, Shinji wasn't happy with it either, but it appeared that he had stopped here for a reason maybe.  
他解开三明治的包装，抬头匆匆瞥了一眼柜台，只见那女孩又坐回到她的凳子上，手里拿着书。看来她对真嗣突然的决定不太满意，因为她的眉毛似乎皱在了一起。好吧，真嗣自己也不高兴，但似乎他停在这里是有原因的。

Tearing a bight out of the sandwich, he started chewing it methodically, as he churned over what he thought he should do.  
他撕下一块三明治，开始有条不紊地咀嚼，同时思索着自己应该怎么做。

Admittedly, though he really _didn't_ want to admit it, he didn't think he could leave Nerv, or at least, he would destroy himself in the process of leaving. The truth was, that he had become used to being around everyone, to enjoy the presence of people around him. He had even become accustomed to piloting Eva, if that sounded logical at.  
不可否认，尽管他真的不想承认，他认为自己无法离开 NERV，或者至少，在离开的过程中他会自我毁灭。事实是，他已经习惯了周围的人，享受着他们的陪伴。他甚至习惯了驾驶 EVA，如果这听起来合乎逻辑的话。

Then of course there was Asuka; he wasn't sure if her existence was a blessing, or a plague upon him. Maybe deep down, he knew he'd never be able to leave, but because of her? Well, he supposed it was likely, but he...just didn't know what he felt. It was sorta just nothing, he supposed. It didn't feel like anything was there, like there never had been. Or maybe...it wasn't something that he could feel, not like a physical form, but neither as something spiritual. Maybe it was because she was missing, like a part of him was gone...or something.  
当然还有明日香；他不确定她的存在是福还是祸。也许在内心深处，他知道自己永远无法离开，但因为她的缘故？嗯，他猜这很有可能，但他...就是不知道自己的感受。他觉得好像什么都没有，他猜。感觉就像那里从未有过什么。或者也许...这不是他能感受到的东西，不是像实体那样的感觉，也不是精神上的东西。也许是因为她不在，就像他的一部分消失了...或者别的什么。

'So damn confusing,' he thought as he put his sandwich down and took a swig of his cola.  
“真是他妈的让人困惑，”他想，放下三明治，喝了一口可乐。

And then there was of course the nagging question of who he was. What was his significance in the Human Instrumentality Project, for he was certainly a key factor? Was his father banking on the fact that he wouldn't leave, or had he already out lived his usefulness? Why did he exhibit angel powers? Why was he able to generate an AT-field? Why was he so different?  
当然，还有一个挥之不去的问题：他是谁？他在人类补完计划中扮演着什么角色，因为他显然是一个关键因素？他的父亲是否寄希望于他不会离开，还是他已经失去了利用价值？为什么他会展现出天使般的力量？为什么他能生成 AT 力场？为什么他如此与众不同？

His father, it always came back to that. What exactly did he know? What was he trying to keep Shinji in the dark about? Who else knew what he might be? Ritsuko? Fuyutsuki? ...Rei, maybe?  
他的父亲，问题总是回到这一点上。他究竟知道些什么？他想对真嗣隐瞒什么？还有谁知道他可能的身份？律子？冬月？...也许还有绫波？

A sudden cough made him jump as he had quite forgotten that he was not alone in the store. Looking up at the counter, he saw that the girl at it was pinching the space in between her eyebrows absently. Shinji could only guess that she was irritated at his presence. Well, he couldn't really blame her.  
突然的一声咳嗽让他吓了一跳，他完全忘记了店里并非只有他一个人。抬头望向柜台，他看到那女孩正无意识地揉着眉间。真嗣只能猜测她是对他的存在感到不悦。嗯，他确实不能怪她。

As Shinji looked away, he was about the take another bight out of his sandwich when he caught glimpse of the book she was reading, and before he could stop himself he was blurting out, "Isn't that _The Catcher in the Rye?"_  
"当真嗣移开视线，正准备再咬一口三明治时，他瞥见了她正在读的那本书，还没来得及阻止自己，就脱口而出：“那不是《麦田里的守望者》吗？””

A long moment of silence passed inside the shop as Shinji slightly rebuked his sudden question. It was rather rude he thought. Though he was surprised as she replied back moments later with a stiff, "Yeah, it is."  
"在店里，长时间的沉默笼罩着，真嗣对自己突如其来的问题感到些许懊悔。他认为这相当无礼。然而，令他惊讶的是，片刻后她僵硬地回答：“是的，就是那本。””

Shinji, unsure of how he was supposed to reply, took a quick sip of his drink and was about to raise the sandwich to his mouth when he heard a question, which sounded as though it didn't care if it was answered or not.  
真嗣不确定该如何回应，迅速喝了一口饮料，正要将三明治举到嘴边时，听到了一个问题，听起来似乎并不在乎是否得到回答。

"Why, have you read it?"  
"怎么，你读过吗？"

Shinji looked up from his meal and turned towards the counter and was rather surprised to see that she was looking at him.  
真嗣从餐盘中抬起头，转向柜台，颇为惊讶地发现她在看着他。

"Sorta...I'm reading it right now, though I haven't been able to read any for almost a week now."  
"算是吧...我现在正在读，不过已经差不多一个星期没读过了。"

"Hmmm, is it a school thing?"  
"嗯，是学校的事吗？"

"No, I'm reading it on my own time."  
"不，我是在自己的时间里读的。"

She looked at him evenly for a second before replying, "...I see."  
她平静地看了他一秒钟，然后回答道：“……我明白了。”

Shinji watched her for a few seconds before turning back towards his sandwich. It wasn't exactly conversational, but he had a better impression of her at least.  
真嗣盯着她看了几秒钟，然后转回身继续吃他的三明治。虽然这不算什么对话，但至少他对她的印象好了一些。

Finishing his first sandwich, he was about ready to start on his second, when the front door of the cafe when flying open, bounced off the opposite wall, only to be kicked as it swung back into place. Shinji watched, with his second sandwich half way to his mouth, as three burly men marched into the cafe and planted themselves in front of the wooden cabin. Something about the way they were shifting their weight back and forth made Shinji feel a certain ominous presence, as though each of them had something bulky and concealed in their jackets.  
吃完第一个三明治后，他正准备开始吃第二个，这时咖啡馆的前门突然被猛地推开，撞到对面的墙上，又被一脚踢回原位。真嗣看着手中的第二个三明治刚送到嘴边，三个魁梧的男人大步走进咖啡馆，站在木屋前。他们来回挪动的样子让真嗣感到一种不祥的气息，仿佛每个人外套下都藏着什么沉重的东西。

Whoever the girl was, she seemed to recognize the three, because she immediately put her book down and hurried around the side of the counter before ending up in front of the men. Shinji seemed to be completely forgotten during this exchange, and suddenly realized he was holding his breath.  
不管那女孩是谁，她似乎认出了这三个人，因为她立刻放下书，匆匆绕过柜台，最后站在了那些人面前。真嗣在这场交流中似乎完全被遗忘了，他突然意识到自己一直屏住呼吸。

The tallest of the three stepped forward as the girl skidded to a half in front of them. Shinji saw him smile, and counted several golden teeth.  
三人中个子最高的那个向前迈了一步，女孩在他们面前滑停了下来。真嗣看到他笑了，数了数有几颗金牙。

"Becca my darling, how goes business today?"  
“贝卡，亲爱的，今天生意如何？”

"I'm sorry Eein, I have not had many customers toda-"  
“对不起，艾因，今天顾客不多——”

"Bah! Again ya useless tramp! What good are ya if ya can't run a simple business!"  
"哼！又是你这个没用的废物！连个简单的生意都经营不好，你有什么用！"

"Please...this place is in such of an out of the way area that people don't want to come."  
"拜托...这个地方太偏僻了，人们都不愿意来。"

"Maybe we out to change the menu a little boss."  
"也许我们应该稍微调整一下菜单，老板。"

Eein turned towards his friend and said, "Like what Gonzo?"  
伊恩转向他的朋友说：“像什么，冈佐？”

"How about, 'Blowjobs five dollars a pop, and titfucks for an extra fifty cents.'"  
“比如，‘口交五美元一次，乳交再加五十分。’”

"You never cease to amaze me Gonzo," replied Eein, as he roared with laughter. "I like it! And she has to keep sucking till she blows their load. Should we give the option of take home photographs so the sleazy perverts can all have something to wank off to when there lonely?"  
“冈佐，你总是让我刮目相看，”伊恩大笑着回答，“我喜欢这个主意！而且她得一直吸到他们射出来。我们是不是应该提供外带照片的选项，这样那些猥琐的变态们孤独时也有东西可以自慰？”

"Boom goes the dynamite," cackled Gonzo as he made a jerking gesture with his right hand.  
"砰的一声，炸药爆炸了，" Gonzo 咯咯笑着，用右手做了一个抽动的动作。

Eein chuckled lightly as he turned towards Rebecca. "So what do ya think? Could you bring in more money that way?"  
Eein 轻声笑了笑，转向 Rebecca。"你觉得怎么样？你能那样赚更多的钱吗？"

Rebecca tried to hide the sadness that welled up in her eyes. "I...don't know, Eein."  
Rebecca 试图掩饰眼中涌起的悲伤。"我...不知道，Eein。"

"Course you don't ya little tramp. You'll do what you're told and not complain about it. So, ya had to have at least one customer today, where's the money?"  
“当然你不会，你这个小荡妇。你得照吩咐做事，别抱怨。所以，你今天至少得有一个客人，钱呢？”

"But-" "但——"

"I take a profit of the money and leave the rest for you're shitless mother. That was the deal...so where is it!"  
“我只拿走我那份钱，剩下的留给你们那无用的母亲。那是协议……所以钱在哪儿！”

Rebecca hung her head as she turned to walk back around the corner, while Eein followed her. Opening the register, Rebecca stood to the side as Eein examined the contents.  
丽贝卡低下头，转身走回拐角处，而艾因紧随其后。丽贝卡打开收银机，站在一旁，让艾因检查里面的内容。

"This it," he exclaimed as he looked at the measly ten dollars and twenty-five cents that sat in the register.  
"就是这些了，" 他看着收银机里那可怜的十美元二十五美分，大声说道。

"I-I did have a customer pay with a card-"  
"我——我确实有一个顾客用信用卡支付了——"

"Dumb fuck! What did I tell you about that hmmmm! We only except cash!"  
"蠢货！我跟你说过多少次了，嗯！我们只收现金！"

"I'm sorry, I forgot..." "对不起，我忘了..."

"You seem to forget a lot...tch whatever."  
"你似乎经常忘记...啧，算了。"

Swiping the money out of the register, he thumbed through it briefly before chucking the twenty-five cents back into the register.  
他从收银机里抽出钱，粗略地翻了翻，然后又将那二十五美分扔回收银机。

"Theres your salary for the day, do what ever the fuck you want with it, even if its for that dying sack of shit of a mother."  
"这是你今天的薪水，随便你怎么花，哪怕是为了你那快死的、烂泥一样的母亲。"

"Thank you-" "谢谢你——"

"You better get down on your fucking knees and kiss my ass. Without me, your mother would be in the fucking ground six feet under."  
"你最好跪下来亲我的屁股。没有我，你妈早就埋在地下六英尺了。"

"I know." "我知道。"

"I really don't think you do," replied Eein with a snarl, as his hand suddenly shot outward and grabbed Rebecca's right breast. Rebecca winced in pain as the large fingers and long finger nails started to dig into the soft flesh.  
"我真的不认为你知道，" Eein 咆哮着回答，他的手突然向外一伸，抓住了 Rebecca 的右胸。Rebecca 因那粗大的手指和长长的指甲开始刺入柔软的肉体而痛苦地皱起了眉头。

"You picked a bad day to irk me, girl. I got pretty pissed earlier and broke some sluts chin for not knowing where her place was; down on all fours howling like a dog. I've got plenty of tension built up right now and would love to release some of it into your pussy. Maybe you'd like to take her place for a bit. I'm sure I could get you squealing like a pig in a matter of seconds."  
"你挑了个惹恼我的糟糕日子，女孩。我之前已经很生气了，因为一个婊子不知道自己的位置，我打碎了她的下巴；她像狗一样趴在地上嚎叫。我现在积攒了很多紧张情绪，很想把它释放到你的阴道里。也许你想暂时取代她的位置。我肯定能让你在几秒钟内像猪一样尖叫。"

Gesturing towards his crew on the other side of the counter, they started walking around so they would soon join there boss in the screw fest. However, as Eein reached for the neckline of Rebecca's shirt, a loud 'clunk' echoed around the small cafe as Shinji slammed what remained of his drink down on the table, sloshing most of the rest of his drink over the side of his cup.  
他向柜台另一边的船员们示意，他们开始绕行，很快就要加入他们的老板，参与这场混乱。然而，当 Eein 伸手去拉 Rebecca 的衬衫领口时，一声响亮的'咔嗒'声在小咖啡馆里回荡，Shinji 将剩下的饮料猛地砸在桌子上，大部分饮料溅出了杯子。

Shinji caught movement immediately as Gonzo and the other thug reached into their coat pockets, but froze their hands when they saw it was just a kid. Looking wildly around at there boss, Eein glanced at Shinji, before nodding towards his two thugs. One dead middle schooler wasn't going to hurt the world a bit.  
Shinji 立刻注意到 Gonzo 和其他暴徒把手伸进外套口袋的动作，但当他们发现只是个孩子时，手就僵住了。他们狂乱地看向老板 Eein，Eein 瞥了一眼 Shinji，然后向他的两个暴徒点头示意。一个死掉的中学生不会对这个世界造成任何伤害。

As Gonzo and the other started pulling out there concealed weapons, the pressure in the room changed dramatically. During the exchange of words, Shinji had watched everything carefully. He didn't want to get himself involved unless he saw absolutely no other option. He didn't want a repeat of the rapist, and this would have been three dead men. He had calmly assessed his options, and decided if worst came to worse, he could threaten them to a certain degree. However, when he heard what Eein was going to do to the girl called Rebecca, Shinji had come very close to lashing out in anger and lopping Eein's head off.  
当 Gonzo 和其他人开始掏出隐藏的武器时，房间内的气氛骤然紧张起来。在言语交锋中，Shinji 仔细观察着一切。除非别无选择，否则他不想卷入其中。他不想重蹈覆辙，那将是三条人命的代价。他冷静地评估了自己的选择，决定在最坏的情况下，他可以适度地威胁他们。然而，当听到 Eein 打算对名叫 Rebecca 的女孩做什么时，Shinji 几乎按捺不住愤怒，差点就要砍下 Eein 的头颅。

Now though, he felt like he was in complete control of the situation. They way he presented his posture, showed that he was utterly lax, and yet the thugs could feel a killing intent coming from him so strong that it was almost constricting their throats. It was like a large weight was suddenly being pressed down on top of them, so much that there backs were threatening to bend. Shinji could almost hear the frantic beating of the three hearts as they waited for him to make a move. The air was suddenly stifling as though Shinji's anger was coursing through the air, and throughout it all, he looked almost serene, and that was the worst part. They got the impression that if he so much as moved his right hand, they would all die.  
然而此刻，他感觉自己完全掌控了局面。他的姿态展现出一种绝对的放松，但那些暴徒却能感受到从他身上散发出的强烈杀意，几乎让他们窒息。仿佛有一股巨大的压力突然压在他们身上，以至于他们的背都快要弯曲了。真嗣几乎能听到那三颗心脏因等待他行动而狂跳的声音。空气突然变得压抑，仿佛真嗣的愤怒在空气中流淌，而在这整个过程中，他看起来却几乎平静，这反而是最糟糕的部分。他们有种感觉，如果他只是动了动右手，他们都会丧命。

The other thug suddenly took a hesitant step back as he felt Shinji's eyes boar into him. Gonzo looked wildly around at his boss and was surprised that his boss was looking intently at Shinji, as though deciding whether or not he could kill the kid before he killed him.  
另一个暴徒突然犹豫地后退了一步，因为他感觉到真嗣的目光如利箭般射向他。Gonzo 疯狂地环顾四周，看向他的老板，惊讶地发现老板正专注地盯着真嗣，似乎在决定是否能在真嗣杀他之前先杀掉这个孩子。

The two glared each other down, while Shinji was getting anxious and was tempted to scare them with his AT-field, when Eein pulled back.  
两人互相瞪视，而真嗣越来越焦虑，甚至想用 AT 力场吓唬他们，这时 Eein 退缩了。

"Sorry that ya had to see that kid," he mumbled, doing a little mock bow in front of Shinji. It was almost as though he was mocking him.  
"抱歉让你这小子看到了，"他咕哝着，在真嗣面前做了个小小的假鞠躬。这几乎像是在嘲弄他。

"Come on guys, we got other stops to make."  
"好了，伙计们，我们还有其他地方要去。"

Without another word, the three thugs exited the shop and passed down the street.  
没再多说一句话，三个流氓离开了商店，沿着街道走去。

Shinji waited until he was certain that they had left the entire block, before he quickly stood up, walked over to the counter and swung his legs over the wooden surface.  
碇真嗣等到确信他们已经离开了整个街区，才迅速站起身，走到柜台前，双腿一跨，越过了木质表面。

Rebecca was sitting on the floor with her legs drawn up to her chest. She seemed to be crying silently, and Shinji was vaguely reminded of a similar experience with Asuka.  
丽贝卡坐在地上，双腿蜷缩至胸前。她似乎在无声地哭泣，这让真嗣隐约想起了与明日香类似的经历。

Kneeling down next to her, he muttered, "You okay?"  
他跪在她旁边，低声问道：“你还好吗？”

"No...I'm...Not," she managed to say through sobs.  
"不...我...不是，"她哽咽着勉强说道。

'Right,' thought Shinji, 'that was a given.'  
'没错，' 真嗣心想，'这是理所当然的。'

"Can I get you anything," he mumbled?  
"我能为你拿些什么吗，"他含糊地问道？

"The...white cloth, next to the coffee machine."  
“那...白色布巾，在咖啡机旁边。”

Standing up, Shinji spotted it immediately as it was the only white thing in the cafe and handed it to her.  
站起身来，真嗣立刻发现了它，因为它是咖啡店里唯一白色的东西，并把它递给了她。

Dabbing at the edges of her eyes with it, she looked up at Shinji. Her eyes were extremely puffy and red.  
她用布巾轻按眼角，抬头看向真嗣。她的眼睛异常红肿。

"I'm sorry you had to see that."  
"我很抱歉你不得不看到那一幕。"

"Its okay..." "没关系..."

She shook her head and said, "No, it really isn't. You're just a kid...and yet..."  
她摇了摇头说：“不，真的不是。你只是个孩子...然而...”

A twinge of annoyance hit Shinji at the word kid. Sure from someone her ages perspective he was a kid, but if she knew what he had done...well...  
听到“孩子”这个词，真嗣心中涌起一丝不悦。确实，从她的年龄来看，他是个孩子，但如果她知道他所做的一切...嗯...

"...And yet you stood up for me," she finished.  
“...而你却为我挺身而出，”她补充道。

Shinji's previous thought was banished at her words, and he was slightly abashed.  
听到她的话，真嗣之前的想法被抛到了九霄云外，他感到有些尴尬。

"I don't really think-" "我真的不觉得——"

"No, its because you were there that they didn't do anything."  
"不，正是因为你在那里，他们才没做什么。"

'Glad to help,' thought Shinji slightly disgruntled.  
“乐意效劳，”真嗣略带不满地想道。

"I'm Rebecca by the way...you?"  
"我叫丽贝卡，你呢？"

"Shinji." "真嗣。"

"Thank you, Shinji..." "谢谢你，真嗣..."

Shinji simply nodded and stood up. Walking over to the coffee machine, he examined it for a minute before deciding that he would rather have tea instead. Looking for a pot and tea leaves, Rebecca realize what he was doing and pointed out where everything was.  
真嗣只是点了点头，站起身来。他走到咖啡机前，仔细打量了一会儿，然后决定还是喝茶更好。他四处寻找茶壶和茶叶，丽贝卡意识到他在做什么，便指出了所有东西的位置。

After setting everything together, the two of them waited for the water to boil.  
一切准备就绪后，两人等待着水烧开。

"Why do you put up with it," Shinji suddenly asked her?  
“你为什么要忍受这些？”真嗣突然问她。

Rebecca was silent for a minute before she replied, "My mother has a rare disease that affects her mental capacity. She has the body of an adult, yet in essence she is a kid. She was born like that, but in recent years its become a lot worse. My father left us last year because he couldn't stand her anymore."  
丽贝卡沉默了一会儿才回答道：“我母亲患有一种罕见的疾病，影响她的心智能力。她拥有成年人的身体，本质上却像个孩子。她生来如此，但近年来情况变得更糟了。我父亲去年离开了我们，因为他再也忍受不了她了。”

"I'm sorry," Shinji muttered.  
“我很抱歉。”真嗣低声说道。

"Don't be...its not like you're to blame."  
“别这样……又不是你的错。”

"But why this? Why this if you hate it so much."  
"但为什么是这个？如果你这么讨厌它，为什么还要这样？"

"...Eein...is rude, disgusting, selfish, an arrogant bastard, and all around sleaze ball. But he is very rich, his father is the president of a petroleum company which deals with the United States. Because of his fathers reputation, he is able to get certain things done that other people wouldn't. He became fond of me a few years ago...when I was still developing, and heard about my mothers dilemma. He told me that if I worked for him, he'd provide the medical insurance to keep her alive and well. And so, I've become something of a slave I guess."  
"...Eein...他粗鲁、恶心、自私、傲慢无礼，是个彻头彻尾的混蛋。但他非常有钱，他父亲是一家与美国有业务往来的石油公司总裁。因为父亲的声望，他能办到别人办不到的事情。几年前，他开始对我感兴趣...那时我还在成长，也听说了我母亲的困境。他告诉我，如果我为他工作，他会提供医疗保险让她活下去并保持健康。于是，我想我成了某种意义上的奴隶。"

"Thats-" "这真是-"

"Cruel? Disgusting? Inhuman? I don't care, my mothers alive."  
"残忍？恶心？不人道？我不在乎，我妈妈还活着。"

"But what about you're life? What do you want to do with yourself? You cant live like this forever; what happens when he throws you away?"  
"但你的生活呢？你想怎么过？你不能永远这样生活下去；他抛弃你的时候怎么办？"

"I'll worry about it when the time comes," she mumbled, though she didn't seem very hopeful.  
"到时候我再担心，"她喃喃道，尽管她看起来并不抱太大希望。"

Shinji was silent for a second, and was thankfully give a reason to stand up as the water came to a boil. Placing the tea leaves in the pot, he waited till they dissolved, and poured two cups of herbal tea into two mugs.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，幸好水开了，他有了站起来的理由。他将茶叶放入茶壶，等待它们溶解，然后将两杯草本茶倒入两个杯子中。

"Thanks," Rebecca said as Shinji passed the cup to her.  
“谢谢，”丽贝卡接过杯子时说道。

Sipping it quietly, Rebecca suddenly turned to Shinji and said, "I was wondering, but didn't bother asking. Do you go to school, or?"  
丽贝卡静静地啜饮着，突然转向真嗣问道：“我一直在想，但没好意思问。你是上学，还是？”

"...Normally yes, but I haven't gone for a week because of...certain circumstances."  
"...通常是的，但因为...某些情况，我已经一周没去了。"

"Would these circumstances have anything to do with the fact that you're in one of the most inhospitable parts of Tokyo-3?"  
"这些情况和你身处东京-3 最不宜居的地区有关系吗？"

"I was just sorta...walking and thinking and lost track of time.  
"我只是...边走边想，不知不觉就忘了时间。"

"This is probably the worst place to get lost in," she mumbled as she took another sip of tea.  
"这大概是迷路最糟糕的地方了，"她喃喃自语，又啜了一口茶。

"I can take care of myself."  
"我能照顾好自己。"

"I assume you can, considering what happened earlier."  
"我猜你行，毕竟之前发生的事儿。"

"Earlier?" "更早之前？"

"With Eein and the others...they almost seemed frightened of you."  
"和 Eein 他们一起...他们看起来几乎害怕你。"

"Can't imagine why," said Shinji while looking the other way.  
"难以想象为什么，" 真嗣说着，目光转向别处。

Rebecca looked at him shrewdly before saying, "Who are you exactly?"  
丽贝卡精明地看了他一眼，然后问道：“你到底是谁？”

Before Shinji was able to stop himself he replied, "I honestly don't know."  
在真嗣能阻止自己之前，他回答说：“我真的不知道。”

"Whats that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"I...don't know why I exist, or what I'm supposed to do."  
"我...不知道我为什么存在，或者我应该做什么。"

"And this has something to do with those circumstances?"  
"这和那些情况有关吗？"

Shinji hesitated for a second before he nodded his head.  
真嗣犹豫了一会儿，然后点了点头。

Rebecca continued looking at him before she threw her arms behind her, and placed her hands palms down on the cold wooden surface of the floor.  
丽贝卡继续盯着他，随后将双臂向后一甩，手掌朝下放在冰冷的木地板上。

"Is it something that you can talk about?" She suddenly asked.  
“这件事你能谈吗？”她突然问道。

Shinji glanced at her out of the corner of his eye. Whatever she had seemed before Shinji started talking to her...well, she certainly wasn't stupid, not to mention rather attractive.  
真嗣用眼角瞥了她一眼。无论她之前给真嗣的印象如何……好吧，她显然不笨，更不用说还相当迷人。

Hesitating for a second, he finally replied, "I suppose its really not something...that the general public is supposed to be aware of."  
犹豫了一下，他最终回答道：“我想这确实不是……公众应该知道的事情。”

"Then I wouldn't bother you about it."  
“那我就不打扰你了。”

"No, I didn't mean to be rude. I just..." Shinji trailed off as he wasn't sure what he was getting at.  
“不，我不是有意无礼。我只是……” 真嗣话没说完，因为他也不确定自己到底想表达什么。

Rebecca continued looking at him, slightly curious, though not wanting pry, about what he was involved with.  
丽贝卡继续注视着他，略感好奇，尽管不想打探，但对他所涉及的事情产生了兴趣。

"You can tell me this much...does it have anything to do with a girl?"  
“你可以告诉我这一点……这和某个女孩有关吗？”

Shinji almost dropped his cup of tea, which was all the reply she needed.  
真嗣差点把手中的茶杯摔落，这个反应已经给了她足够的答案。

"So it does have something to do with a girl," replied Rebecca with a raised eyebrow.  
“所以这确实和某个女孩有关，”丽贝卡扬起眉毛回答道。

Turning towards her, Shinji stammered back, "No, not really...I-I mean, theres a girl involved...but she's not like...a center...problem, or anything."  
转向她，真嗣结结巴巴地反驳道：“不，不是真的……我的意思是，有个女孩牵扯其中……但她不像……中心……问题，或者别的什么。”

Rebecca suddenly smiled at Shinji's hopeless attempt at refuting how he had acted. The change in her appearance was dramatic, as her smile seemed to throw her entire face into a new light.  
丽贝卡突然对真嗣无力反驳自己行为的方式笑了。她的变化很戏剧性，笑容似乎让她的整张脸都焕发出新的光彩。

"So then whats the problem?"  
"那问题出在哪儿呢？"

"I...guess I'm just afraid."  
"我...我想我只是害怕。"

"Of what?" "怕什么？"

"Of being alone...of being unwanted."  
"孤独...不被需要的感觉。"

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"Because...well, its hard since I just met you, to explain everything, but my childhood wasn't exactly endearing. I moved around a lot, lived with a lot of people. My father was making me do this, he abandoned me when I was young...like around four or something. I hated human contact, still find it difficult to associate with other people for that matter. But now I've become afraid of being useless, because I don't want my life to go back to what it was. I found a purpose in my life, but I don't know why I do what I do. I feel like I'm...living out other peoples dreams and wishes. Where are my desires? What reason do I have to live if all I'm doing is living for other people? I've been confined at a certain...place for a while, and managed to escape just a little while ago."  
"因为...嗯，毕竟我们刚认识，解释一切有点困难，但我的童年并不怎么令人怀念。我经常搬家，和很多人住在一起。我父亲让我做这些，他在我很小的时候就抛弃了我...大概四岁左右。我讨厌人际接触，至今仍觉得和别人打交道很困难。但现在我开始害怕变得无用，因为我不想回到过去的生活。我在生活中找到了目标，但我不知道自己为什么要这么做。我感觉自己...像是在实现别人的梦想和愿望。我的欲望在哪里？如果我只是在为别人而活，那我还有什么理由活下去？我曾被关在一个地方一段时间，不久前才设法逃出来。"

"Is the person on the card the one that helped you escape?"  
"卡片上的人是帮你逃脱的那位吗？"

"So you saw that?" replied Shinji trying not to sound sheepish.  
"所以你看到了？" 真嗣回答，尽量不显得尴尬。

"Yeah, I just didn't really care at the time."  
"是啊，我当时真的不太在意。"

"The only way I could escape was if I had that card. I had to go through some security check points, and without it...well."  
"我唯一能逃脱的方法就是用那张卡。我得通过一些安检点，没有它的话...嗯。"

"And its also a debit card?"  
"而且它也是借记卡？"

"...Yeah..." "……嗯……"

"Sounds to me like you got yourself into some pretty bad shit."  
"听起来你似乎惹上了些大麻烦。"

'If you only new the half of it,' thought Shinji.  
“如果你只了解其中的一半，”真嗣心想。

"So, what are you going to do now? Go back?"  
“那么，你现在打算怎么办？回去吗？”

"I knew from the minute I left that I'd have to come back, at least eventually, because I couldn't just abandon everybody after everything we've been through."  
“我从离开的那一刻起就知道，我终究得回来，至少是迟早的事，因为我不能就这样在我们经历了那么多之后抛弃大家。”

"And yet you still don't know what to do?"  
"然而你还是不知道该怎么做？"

"...Right..." "...没错..."

Rebecca sat up suddenly and reached for something in her jean pocket. Pulling out a lighter and a pack of cigarettes, she put a cigarette in her mouth and was about to light it when she caught the sideways glance from Shinji.  
丽贝卡突然坐起身，伸手去掏牛仔裤口袋里的东西。她掏出一个打火机和一包香烟，将一支烟叼在嘴里，正要点燃时，注意到了真嗣斜眼的一瞥。

"Sorry," she replied after realizing that his expression was one of annoyance. "Its a bad habit, and I know it is."  
"对不起，"她意识到他的表情带着恼怒后回答道，"这是个坏习惯，我知道。"

"Its fine, I know somebody that smokes at least two packs a day."  
"没关系，我认识一个人，每天至少抽两包烟。"

"Now thats murder," replied Rebecca with a slight chuckle.  
"那可真是要命，"丽贝卡轻声笑道。"

Silence passed between them again until Rebecca said, "And I thought that my life had problems."  
沉默再次在他们之间蔓延，直到丽贝卡说道：“我还以为我的生活已经够麻烦了。”

"Huh?" “啊？”

"Look...Shinji. I don't mean to know much about life and what not, but I can tell that you have stuff going on in your life that no fourteen year should have to bear."  
“听着……真嗣。我并不想过多了解生活之类的事，但我能看出你生活中有些事情是一个十四岁的孩子不该承受的。”

"I'm fifteen..." “我十五岁了……”

"Big difference. Anyway...I believe that each person was put on this planet for a reason, and while I haven't figured out my reason, I still believe that. As for you...when all else fails, follow what your heart says."  
"天壤之别。不过...我相信每个人来到这个世界上都有其原因，虽然我还没找到自己的原因，但我依然坚信这一点。至于你...当一切方法都行不通时，就听从你的心声吧。"

"My heart?" "我的心？"

"Yeah, its usually more correct then the brain at least. And for...well, whatever you do, maybe its okay to not have a legitimate reason. Its what you feel at the time thats important after all. Are you protecting somebody?"  
"是的，至少它通常比大脑更正确。而且...无论你做什么，或许没有正当理由也没关系。毕竟，重要的是你当时的感受。你在保护某个人吗？"

'If you knew that I was protecting you and all the citizens of Tokyo-3 what would you say?' wondered Shinji.  
'如果你知道我是在保护你和所有第三新东京市的市民，你会怎么想？' 真嗣思索着。

"Yeah, I'm protecting people."  
“是啊，我在保护人们。”

"Then isn't it enough to know that you prevented there deaths from happening?"  
“那么，知道你阻止了他们的死亡，这还不够吗？”

"But its not like that...its different...but I can't explain it without telling you everything."  
"但事情不是那样的...这是不同的...但如果我不告诉你一切，就无法解释清楚。"

"Then why not just tell me? You certainly seem like you need someone to talk to."  
"那为什么不直接告诉我呢？你看起来确实需要有人倾诉。"

Should he? Should he really tell a total stranger that he's barely known for twenty minutes the inner working of Nerv? He could almost hear Misato's voice as it yelled at him in his head.  
他应该吗？他真的应该告诉一个只认识了二十分钟的完全陌生的人关于 NERV 的内部运作吗？他几乎能听到美里在他脑海中对他大喊的声音。

"I really shoul-" "我真的应-"

Shinji was suddenly cut off as something that sounded like twenty fire truck sirens exploded into the open air. Sending him down onto all fours, he covered his ears up and tried to cut out the sudden wailing. Next to him, it seemed that Rebecca was doing likewise, though she seemed to understand what it was.  
真嗣话音未落，一阵如同二十辆消防车警笛齐鸣的巨响突然在空气中炸开。他被震得四肢着地，双手捂住耳朵，试图隔绝这突如其来的哀嚎。在他身旁，丽贝卡似乎也在做着同样的事情，但她似乎明白这是什么。

As the wailing subsided, and the ringing in Shinji's ears dissipated, Shinji saw Rebecca hurry to her feet and starting cursing suddenly.  
随着哀嚎声减弱，真嗣耳中的轰鸣逐渐消散，他看到丽贝卡急忙站起身来，突然开始咒骂起来。

"God damn it! Why the fuck is the damn siren directly above this fucking shop."  
"该死！这该死的警报器怎么就正好在这家破店上面。"

"What was tha-" Shinji started asking, though she cut him off.  
""这是怎么——"" 真嗣刚开口，就被她打断了。

"Its the evacuation siren. Surely you've experienced this before? God knows they've been opening up the shelters enough recently."  
"这是疏散警报。你肯定之前经历过吧？天知道他们最近开了多少次避难所。"

"Shelters...what?" "避难所...什么？"

"Come on! We've gotta move to the nearest one."  
"快点！我们得去最近的那个。"

"But I..." "但我..."

'Angel attack,' his mind suddenly whispered to him.  
“天使来袭，”他的脑海中突然响起这个声音。

It had to be, there was no other explanation, and without him, they were short one extra pilot.  
一定是这样，没有其他解释了，而且没有他，他们就少了一个额外的驾驶员。

'Then what should I do?' he asked himself. 'Ignore it? Continue on and act as though everything was perfectly fine. Abandoned everybody that he had come to know?'  
“那我该怎么办？”他自问。“无视它？继续前进，装作一切正常。抛弃所有他认识的人？”

Shinji, who had just stepped outside the small shop and onto the pavement suddenly stop dead in his tracks and jerked Rebecca's hand, which had been holding onto his wrist.  
刚刚从小店出来踏上人行道的真嗣突然停住了脚步，猛地拽了一下正抓着他手腕的丽贝卡的手。

"Shinji wha-" “真嗣，怎——”

Rebecca gasped as she felt Shinji's arm suddenly go slack in her grasp, and next second his legs gave out from under him, as he fell forwards into her chest.  
丽贝卡倒吸一口凉气，感觉到真嗣的手臂在她手中突然松软下来，紧接着他的双腿一软，向前倒在了她的胸前。

"Shin-" "真-

Shinji's eyes flew open as he let out a blood curdling scream. Like a tree struck by lightning, his head suddenly felt as though it had been cloven in two and was on fire. Grabbing the spot where the temples where located on either side of his head, he staggered backwards out of Rebecca's chest, and slammed the back of his head into the brick wall of the cafe. A small stream of blood started flowing behind his head now, and some be seen congealing in his eyebrows.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，发出一声撕心裂肺的尖叫。仿佛被雷击中的树一般，他的头突然感到像是被劈成了两半，并且着了火。他双手紧抓着头部两侧的太阳穴位置，踉跄地从丽贝卡的胸前退了出来，后脑勺重重地撞在了咖啡馆的砖墙上。一股细小的血流开始从他脑后流出，有些血迹凝结在他的眉毛上。

Why now? Why did it have to happen now of all times? But really, he should have expected that. They always came when something he was doing affected the lives of somebody greatly.  
为什么是现在？为什么偏偏是这个时候发生？但实际上，他早该预料到的。每当他做的事情对某人的生活产生重大影响时，这些事情总会找上门来。

A vision struck Shinji so greatly that he had blacked out momentarily, his eyes glazing over. In that short time span of him being unconscious, it felt as though he had seen enough horrible things to right a book on them, when really, in reality, it had lasted no longer then a second.  
一个强烈的幻象击中了真嗣，让他短暂地失去了意识，双眼变得呆滞。在那短暂的失去意识的时间里，他感觉自己仿佛看到了足够写一本书的可怕事物，而实际上，这一切只持续了不到一秒钟。

Tokyo-3 as he had known it, was no more. A giant crater instead stood where Tokyo-3 had once stood, a crater that no meteorite could have caused. Some buildings from the remains of Tokyo-3 lay scattered around the land scape, as though a small infant had picked them up, only to discard them later as it found a new toy. The Sea of Tokyo had filled the vast majority of the large crater, except that it no longer supported any form of marine wildlife; the sea had turned a blood red.  
他所熟知的东京-3 已不复存在。取而代之的是一个巨大的陨石坑，绝非陨石撞击所能形成。东京-3 的残骸中，有些建筑散落在地貌各处，仿佛一个幼童将它们拾起，又在新玩具的诱惑下随意丢弃。东京湾的海水填满了大部分巨坑，只是这片海域已不再孕育任何海洋生物；海水变成了血红色。

Shinji then felt himself being pulled violently backwards as he witnessed the cause of everything. It had been an angel that descended on them, the likes of which they had never fought before. The AT-field was impossible to penetrate.  
随后，真嗣感到自己被猛地向后拽去，他目睹了一切灾难的源头。那是一个天使降临在他们面前，是他们从未遭遇过的强大存在。其 AT 力场坚不可摧。

Shinji watched as Misato gave the order for the deployment of all the Eva's, though in truth it was only one. The dummy plug was inserted into units 01 and 02, though to no avail. Shinji couldn't understand why unit 02 hadn't responded to the signal though. Eventually Commander Ikari gave the order for Rei's deployment with Asuka backing her up, though it seemed that Misato had to refute that. Even though she was speaking against the Commander, her voice seemed unusually strong, as though she had finally come to terms with something. She told the Commander that under no circumstances was Asuka able to pilot. Even Ritsuko backed up her statement with a brief summary of Asuka's mental health and it clearly stated that any contact with an Evangelion would surely send her into a coma. Eventually Rei was forced to deploy by herself and stall while they searched for Shinji. That had been particularly hard to watch, as the Shinji from this vision had long since died off, figuratively speaking of course.  
真嗣注视着美里下达所有 Eva 出击的命令，尽管实际上只有一台。模拟插入栓被插入 01 和 02 号机，却毫无效果。真嗣不解为何 02 号机未响应信号。最终，碇司令命令丽出击，由明日香支援，但美里似乎不得不反驳这一决定。尽管她在反对司令，语气却异常坚定，仿佛终于接受了某事。她告诉司令，无论如何明日香都无法驾驶 Eva。甚至连律子也简述了明日香的心理状况来支持她的说法，明确指出任何与 Eva 的接触都必将使她陷入昏迷。最终，丽被迫独自出击拖延时间，同时他们寻找真嗣。这一幕尤为难以目睹，因为从这个视角来看，真嗣早已在精神上消逝，当然，这只是比喻。

Rei deployed, and attempted to destroy the angels AT-field, but it had all but proved immune to all attacks. Eventually, she was forced to detonated an N2 bomb point blank in the angels face, but that had proved to do more harm than good, as much of the armor plating of 00 was melted off in the ensuing explosion.  
零号机展开了攻击，试图摧毁使徒的 AT 力场，但几乎所有攻击都对其无效。最终，她被迫在使徒的脸上引爆了一枚 N2 炸弹，但这反而造成了更大的伤害，因为爆炸中零号机的装甲板大部分都被熔化了。

The angel completely ignored Rei and Unit 00 after this and proceeded to destroy most of the armor plating layers that separated Tokyo-3 from the Geofront. Doing this last part exceptionally well, it slowly descended into the narrow hole that it had opened up in the Geofront. Breaking into Central Dogma was now all but too easy, as the minor defenses that Nerv had implemented had never been strong enough to combat an angel. In a last ditch effort to destroy the angel, Commander Ikari had given the JSDF authorization to drop several N2 bombs inside the Geofront. The N2 bombs barely even fazed the angel, since the AT-field completely protected it from any outside harm.  
使徒完全无视了零和零号机，继续摧毁了大部分分隔东京-3 与地底都市的装甲层。它做得非常出色，缓缓降入自己在地底都市打开的狭窄洞口。突破中央教条现在变得异常容易，因为 NERV 部署的那些防御措施从未强大到足以对抗使徒。在最后的努力中，碇司令授权自卫队在地底都市内投下几枚 N2 炸弹。然而，N2 炸弹几乎对使徒毫无影响，因为 AT 力场完全保护了它免受任何外部伤害。

What was probably the hardest part of Shinji however was when he witnessed what happened to Asuka. Misato had given authorization to move Asuka out of the medical facilities and move her into one of the underground bunkers that littered the landscape of the Geofront. If only she had realized the gravity of her decision.  
然而，对真嗣来说最艰难的部分，莫过于他目睹了明日香所遭遇的一切。美里批准将明日香从医疗设施中转移出来，安置到地表下遍布的地下掩体之一。如果她当时能意识到这一决定的严重性就好了。

This had been different then Shinji's previous dreams about Asuka, in the sense that this was more gruesome, if that was even physically possible. The hardest part, was that Asuka had been awake and conscious throughout it all, able to feel the pain as her body was ripped apart, and Shinji was able to feel the pain that she had felt.  
这与真嗣之前关于明日香的梦境截然不同，这一次更加惨烈，如果这从物理上讲还有可能的话。最痛苦的是，明日香在整个过程中都是清醒的，能感受到身体被撕裂的痛楚，而真嗣也感同身受地体会到了她的痛苦。

The underground bunker that she had been moved to, was little more than a small room surround by metal, and in hind site, the metal box that she was incased in produced the hurt and tragedy.  
她被转移到的地下掩体，不过是一个被金属包围的小房间，事后看来，这个金属囚笼加剧了她的痛苦与悲剧。

When the angel descended, it continued firing off its AT-field, ripping apart the ground beneath it as though it were splitting the Red Sea, except this gouge in the Earth stayed like that. The pieces of earth that had been ripped apart were flung through the air like a rag dog, tearing trees and small buildings that housed some residents of the Geofront. Part of the earth that the angel had ripped apart, housed the bunker that Asuka was being kept in.  
当使徒降临之时，它持续释放着 AT 力场，撕裂着脚下的地面，仿佛在分隔红海，只不过这道地球上的裂痕就此永久留存。被撕裂的土块如同破布狗一般被抛向空中，摧毁了树木和一些居民居住的小型建筑。使徒撕裂的地面部分，正是关押着明日香的地堡所在。

The bunker was completely sheared in two, leaving a gaping hole in the roof. Twisted pieces of metal lay scattered across the floor, and one piece in particular piqued his attention.  
地堡被完全切成了两半，屋顶留下了一个巨大的缺口。扭曲的金属碎片散落一地，其中一块特别引起了他的注意。

Asuka's right arm had been penetrated straight through by the chunk of metal, splintering the bone in the process. Blood boiled to the surface and leaked over the side of the arm and started dripping onto the floor. Asuka let out a loud moan of despair as the pain suddenly hit her like a ton of bricks. Attempting to amend the pain, she grasped the end of the metal stake with her left, clenched her teeth, and pulled as hard as her frail body would allow her. She only succeeded in causing herself more pain.  
明日香的右臂被金属块直接贯穿，过程中骨头也碎裂了。血液沸腾着涌向表面，沿着手臂一侧流淌，滴落到地板上。明日香发出一声绝望的呻吟，疼痛突然如同一吨重的砖块般袭来。她试图缓解疼痛，用左手抓住金属桩的末端，紧咬牙关，用她虚弱的身体所能承受的最大力量拉扯。结果只是让自己更加痛苦。

Her vision started to grow foggy from the blood loss, and finally she stood up and attempted to wrench the door open that would grant her freedom. However, it wouldn't budge. Behind the door, the opposite wall and the roof above had caved in and crumbled, creating an affective barrier against her freedom.  
她的视线因失血开始变得模糊，最终她站起身来，试图用力拉开那扇能赋予她自由的门。然而，门却纹丝不动。门后，对面的墙壁和屋顶已经坍塌崩裂，形成了一道有效的屏障，阻挡了她的自由之路。

Staggering backwards, she turned around and pressed her back against the cold metal door and said in a quite voice that seemed devoid of life, "Is anyone...there? Someone...please! Help!"  
她踉跄后退，转过身来，将背紧贴在冰冷的金属门上，用一种似乎毫无生气的平静声音说道：“有人吗...那里？有人...请帮帮我！”

Shinji felt completely helpless as he watched Asuka scratch her finger nails against the metal door. The sounds that echoed off the metal walls sounded like a banshee's screech.  
看着明日香用指甲刮擦金属门的情景，真嗣感到彻底的无助。那声音在金属墙壁间回荡，听起来就像女妖的尖叫。

Eventually, Asuka slid down the metal door and rested at the bottom of it with her left hand wrapped around the twisted piece of metal that was perturbing out of her arm. Giving an almighty wrench, she attempted to pull it out again, but this time managed to split the palm of her hand open, created a new stream of blood. Soon the floor beneath was covered in bright red fluid, as her body's life force was slowly drained away.  
最终，明日香顺着金属门滑下，坐在底部，左臂上扭曲的金属片刺穿皮肤，她用左手紧紧抓住它。她使出全力试图再次拔出，却意外地撕裂了手掌，鲜血如新涌的溪流般流淌。很快，地板被鲜红的液体覆盖，她的生命力正逐渐流失。

Shinji attempted to turn away from the horrific scene, by he found that his body was simply refusing to obey him, almost as though a supernatural force was rooting him to the stop, forcing him to watch the outcome of a possible decision of his.  
真嗣试图转过身去，避开这恐怖的场景，但他发现自己的身体根本不听使唤，仿佛有一股超自然的力量将他牢牢固定在原地，迫使他目睹自己可能选择的结果。

With an almighty explosion, Shinji saw a brief flash of orange that he was barely able to pick up as the angel ripped apart the earth again, this time sending up a large cloud of dust into the air. Gazing at the angel momentarily, he saw that what was considered its head had two sunken, gleaming red eyes, peering out of the skull. Next second, another explosion of brilliant orange light flashed outward from the angel, though this time Shinji could have sworn he saw it shoot out of its eyes, as though it was some sort of laser.  
随着一声震耳欲聋的爆炸，真嗣瞥见了一抹橙光，那是天使再次撕裂大地时他勉强捕捉到的景象，这一次扬起了一大片尘土。他短暂地凝视着天使，发现被视为其头部的位置有两只深陷的、闪着红光的眼睛，从颅骨中窥视着外界。紧接着，又一道耀眼的橙色光芒从天使身上爆发出来，但这次真嗣敢肯定，那光芒仿佛是从它的眼睛中射出的，就像某种激光一样。

Tearing his gaze away from the angel, he looked back to the spot where Asuka had been, only to be surprised that she had vacated her spot, and was slowly plodding towards the new gaping hole in the wall that the angel had created with the second explosion. Asuka seemed to be on the verge of collapsing, as her body's functions started to break down, and it was all she could do to force herself to keep moving. At this point, Shinji had attempted to reach out in his mind to her, determined that because it was her, and because of him possessing angel powers, that he would be able to call out to her. No such thing happened of course, since in all aspects, the Shinji thats decision had led to this scenario, was no longer even present. He had simply dropped out of reality. He had forsaken Asuka because of his own fears, and in doing so, had tossed away the relationship they once had.  
他强迫自己从天使身上移开视线，回头望向明日香所在的地方，却惊讶地发现她已经离开了原位，正缓缓向天使用第二次爆炸制造的新墙洞走去。明日香似乎快要支撑不住了，身体机能开始崩溃，她所能做的只是强迫自己继续前行。此时，真嗣试图在心中向她伸出援手，坚信因为她是明日香，也因为自己拥有天使之力，他能够呼唤她。当然，这一切并未发生，因为导致这一局面的真嗣已经不复存在，他彻底脱离了现实。他因自己的恐惧而抛弃了明日香，也因此断送了他们曾经的关系。

As Asuka continued crawling towards her objective, Shinji saw it a split second before it happened, and in what was possibly a last attempt to communicate with her, reached his hand out towards her.  
当明日香继续向目标爬行时，真嗣在事情发生前一瞬间看到了，可能是最后一次试图与她沟通，他向她伸出了手。

A metal beam directly above where Asuka was crawling suddenly snapped in two, as the bolts holding it in place could no longer contain the strain. The beam pierced her back and sheared through the flesh as it ripped apart her internal organs, before exiting through the other side, forcing her ribs to pop out through her white skin. The beam struck the concrete flooring with a loud 'clang,' as it chipped away some of the flooring, scattering pebbles everywhere. Blood gushed out of her open wound and flowed down the metal beam and onto the floor in a puddle. Likewise, blood surged up her throat before she vomited, pushing stomach bile mixed with blood out of her mouth, which slid down her chin and would eventually cake onto her face.  
一根金属横梁正好悬在明日香爬行的地方，突然断裂成两截，固定它的螺栓再也无法承受压力。横梁刺穿她的背部，撕裂了内脏，然后从另一侧穿出，迫使她的肋骨刺破白皙的皮肤。横梁重重地砸在混凝土地板上，发出响亮的‘哐当’声，砸碎了一些地板，石子四散飞溅。鲜血从她敞开的伤口中涌出，顺着金属横梁流下，在地板上形成一滩血泊。同样，血液涌上她的喉咙，她随即呕吐，将混合着血液的胃液从口中喷出，顺着下巴滑落，最终凝结在她的脸上。

The only thing that could be thankfully said, was that she felt very little pain, as the beam had ripped apart the right ventricle of her heart and the aorta, killing her within seconds.  
唯一值得庆幸的是，她几乎感觉不到疼痛，因为横梁已经撕裂了她心脏的右心室和主动脉，使她在几秒钟内丧命。

Without having a second to think about what had happened any clear than what he was currently watching, Shinji suddenly felt his entire body being jerked backwards as though an invisible hook grabbed the back of his shirt.  
还没来得及清晰地思考刚刚发生的一切，真嗣突然感到整个身体被猛地向后拽，仿佛有一只无形钩子抓住了他衬衫的后背。

Darkness engulfed him and it felt as though he was being propelled down a dark tunnel with no end in sight. With the sleeve of his shirt flapping in the wind and his eyes starting to water from the shear speed he was falling at, Shinji suddenly felt himself hit the surface of something, and next second noticed that his body suddenly felt much heavier as the clothes he was wearing became soaked as they absorbed the large body of blood red water that he had fallen in.  
黑暗吞噬了他，感觉就像是被推进了一条没有尽头的黑暗隧道。随着衬衫袖子在风中飘动，眼睛因极速下坠而开始流泪，真嗣突然感到自己撞上了某个表面，下一秒就注意到身体突然变得沉重，身上的衣服因吸收了大量的血红色水体而湿透。

Attempting to claw his way to the surface where sweet fresh air awaited him, he suddenly noticed another presence with him in the watery depths. Turning towards this new presence, he suddenly found himself facing a mirror in all this blackness. Though instead of his own reflection looking back at him, he saw-  
他试图挣扎着游向水面，那里有清新的空气在等待着他，却突然察觉到水中还有另一个存在。转向这个新出现的存在，他在这一片漆黑中突然发现自己面对着一面镜子。然而，映照回来的并非他自己的倒影，而是——

"Disgusting isn't it, what one small choice can do," replied the pseudo Asuka.  
“真是令人作呕，不是吗？一个小小的选择能带来什么后果，”假扮的明日香回答道。

"Stop it!" Shinji yelled "住手！" 真嗣大喊

"Why should I? You don't seem to get it. You don't seem to get the fact what your decisions can lead to. Think of it this way, you are standing on a path, and this path can lead to multiple directions. Within these multiple directions are other directions, and thousands like it. From the very moment you stepped into her world, you have slowly been leading down a path of destruction. You cannot turn away from what awaits you."  
"我为什么要住手？你似乎不明白。你不明白你的决定可能导致的后果。这么想吧，你站在一条岔路上，这条路可以通向多个方向。在这些多个方向中，还有其他方向，以及成千上万个类似的方向。从你踏入她的世界的那一刻起，你就慢慢走上了一条毁灭之路。你无法逃避即将到来的命运。"

"This isn't it!" "这不是终点！"

"No, it may not be, but something like it is a possibility in the all too distant future. How many angels are left including this one...three...four?"  
"不，或许不会，但在遥不可及的未来，类似的情况是有可能发生的。包括这位在内，还剩下多少天使...三个...四个？"

"I'm human, as human I make wrong decisions."  
"我是人，正因如此，我会做出错误的决定。"

"But you don't change, and you never will! You keep thinking the same pathetic things. 'Don't hurt me. Don't abandon me. Make me exist. Hold me! Love me!' Such petty human things disgust me so much that I almost wish that you had died long before it ever came to this. But things have, so deal with your problems and stopped winning and complaining to other people about your problems. What does it take for you to realize it? Do I have to rip apart the flesh of somebody near to you? Should I take the form of a human dear to you and rip apart your heart from within?"  
"但你从未改变，也永远不会改变！你总是想着那些可悲的事情。‘别伤害我。别抛弃我。让我存在。抱紧我！爱我！’这些卑微的人类情感让我如此厌恶，以至于我几乎希望你早在这一切发生之前就死去。但既然事情已经发生了，就处理好你的问题，停止抱怨并向他人诉苦。你到底要怎样才能明白？难道我非得撕裂某个亲近之人的血肉吗？我是否应该化作你珍视的人类模样，从内部撕碎你的心？"

The mirror in front of him suddenly changed and Shinji's own reflection was suddenly looked back at him, except this Shinji was different. This Shinji had blood red eyes, and a killing intent that forced people to scatter at his very presence. Behind him lay a torrent of fire and death. Before him lay a skinny boy no more then fifteen who was seeing his other self. His angel self.  
他面前的镜子突然发生了变化，真嗣自己的倒影突然回望着他，只不过这个真嗣有所不同。这个真嗣有着血红色的眼睛，以及一种令人望而生畏的杀意。他身后是一片火海与死亡。在他面前，站着一个瘦弱的男孩，不超过十五岁，正凝视着自己的另一个自我。他的天使自我。

"I'm...an angel?" “我……是天使吗？”

"No," replied the entity that stood in front of him. "You are not, but you have angel blood flowing through you, as well as your DNA structure which consists of extra chromosomes."  
“不，”站在他面前的存在回答道，“你不是，但你体内流淌着天使之血，你的 DNA 结构也包含了额外的染色体。”

"How did this happen?" "这是怎么发生的？"

"I can't say, for you are not ready to know. Do not make the same mistake that I made."  
"我不能说，因为你还未准备好知道。不要重蹈我的覆辙。"

"...What mistake?" "...什么错误？"

"I followed a different path then the one you followed...it led to this ending."  
"我选择了与你不同的道路……它导致了这样的结局。"

Shinji suddenly found himself witnessing the aftermath of the battle with the angel Zeruel. Death and devastation lay everywhere, bodies where flung left and right, large buildings where toppled, dried blood lay caked on the roads and streets.  
真嗣突然发现自己目睹了与天使 Zeruel 战斗后的惨状。死亡与毁灭无处不在，尸体四处散落，巨大的建筑物被推倒，干涸的血迹凝固在道路和街道上。

"What...happened?" "发生了……什么？"

"I abandoned my human half and completely absorbed the angel part of me. Every human became my enemy...I purged the entire planet of all humans using Evangelion Unit 01 and my powers. Soon the angels will refurbish the Earth and start another rebuilding..."  
"我舍弃了人性，完全融入了天使的部分。所有人类都成了我的敌人……我利用 EVA 初号机和我的力量，将地球上的人类全部清除。不久，天使们将重塑地球，开始新一轮的重建……"

"Another rebuilding?" "新一轮的重建？"

"It is a cycle that has gone on for billions of years. The angels are nothing more then energy beings, and they constantly expel energy in order to create life, life force if you will. At least the majority of them do. The flesh that you see is simply to give them a definable shape.  
"这是一个已经持续了数十亿年的循环。天使不过是能量体，他们不断释放能量以创造生命，或者说生命力。至少大多数天使是这样。你所看到的肉体，只是为了给他们一个可辨识的形态。"

"Adam and Lilith are special. They alone created humans. Adam hallowed your bodies and created the limbs and bodily functions that you take for granted. Lilith created your souls, and in doing so, who you are as a person. The other angels create life as they see fit. Some are in charge of plants, while others are in charge of animals. Even the very air that you breath was created by us. The Earth had been polluted by humans, or the Lilim if you prefer. They were an experiment, nothing more, but Adam and Lilith saw that they were flawed. They became greedy of what they saw around them and wanted more. They built large factories which expelled great amounts of carbon monoxide and other poisons. The rivers, the lakes, the oceans, look everywhere and you will see the decay of things."  
亚当和莉莉丝是特别的。他们独自创造了人类。亚当赋予了你们身体，创造了你们视为理所当然的四肢和生理功能。莉莉丝创造了你们的灵魂，也因此塑造了你们作为人的本质。其他天使按照他们的意愿创造生命。有些负责植物，有些负责动物。甚至你们呼吸的空气也是我们创造的。地球曾被人类，或者说莉莉姆污染。他们只是一个实验，仅此而已，但亚当和莉莉丝看到了他们的缺陷。他们变得贪婪，渴望更多。他们建造了大型工厂，排放大量一氧化碳和其他有毒物质。河流、湖泊、海洋，四处看看，你会看到事物的腐朽。

Shinji was speechless as his other self continued its rant.  
真嗣无言以对，他的另一个自我继续发泄着不满。

"I abandoned my human self, and became the non-existent nineteenth angel, which never should have been. I killed everyone and everything and have ushered in a new beginning, but I am still you. No matter how much I despise who I am or who you are as a person, I am still Shinji Ikari, and that wont change. Do not do what I did. You are not ready for the truth of who you are. It will drive you crazy, insane, and you'll kill everyone you hold dear. Even as I killed them I did not feel anything, and yet my eyes still cried. I pulled apart there bodies with the greatest ease and not once did I feel as though what I was doing was wrong. I think I might have even laughed at one point while I killed everyone."  
"我抛弃了人类的自我，化身为本不应存在的第十九使徒。我屠戮了所有人事物，迎来了一个新的开始，但我依然是你。无论我多么憎恶自己或你作为人的本质，我依旧是碇真嗣，这一点不会改变。不要重蹈我的覆辙。你还未准备好面对真实的自我。那真相会让你疯狂，让你崩溃，你会杀害所有珍视的人。即便我杀了他们，内心却毫无波澜，然而我的双眼仍在流泪。我轻易地撕裂他们的身体，从未感到自己所做的是错误的。甚至在那一刻，我或许还笑了出来。"

"You are not me," Shinji suddenly said.  
"你不是我，" 真嗣突然说道。"

"Yes I am! I am the you that diverged on a different path. I am the you that tore Misato's head off with my own hands! I am the you that killed his own father and then bathed in his blood. I am the you that gouged Rei's eyes off and disemboweled her. I am the you that cut Asuka's arms and legs off and proceeded to rape her-"  
"是的，我就是你！我是那个走上不同道路的你。我是那个亲手扯下美里头颅的你！我是那个弑父并沐浴其血的你。我是那个挖出绫波双眼并将其开膛破肚的你。我是那个砍断明日香四肢并强暴她的你——"

Shinji suddenly punched the mirror in front of him with all his might. His fist went straight through it as though it had never been there, and from Shinji's perspective it hadn't. It had simply disappeared as though it had been a mirage underwater.  
真嗣突然用尽全力向面前的镜子挥拳。他的拳头径直穿透了镜子，仿佛它从未存在过，从真嗣的角度看，它确实不存在。它就像水下的海市蜃楼一样，简单地消失了。

"I am not you," Shinji repeated. "I will never be you. You may look and sound like me, but you aren't. I would sooner kill myself then do that to my friends."  
"我不是你，"真嗣重复道，"我永远不会成为你。你可能看起来和听起来都像我，但你不是我。我宁愿自杀，也不会那样对待我的朋友。"

"Maybe you aren't so weak after all."  
"也许你并没有那么软弱。"

Shinji spun around under the water and turned to face the pseudo Asuka.  
真嗣在水下旋转了一圈，转身面对那个伪装的明日香。

"Did you do that?" “是你做的吗？”

"No...I didn't. That was the subconscious part of your mind trying to draw out your angel self. Quite frankly I thought you would have relented and become the nineteenth angel. As I said, you are stronger than I thought."  
“不……我没有。那是你潜意识中试图唤醒你天使自我的一部分。坦白说，我以为你会屈服并成为第十九使徒。正如我所说，你比我想象的要坚强。”

"Is what he said true...about the choices he made."  
"他说的那些关于选择的话...是真的吗？"

"Yes, it is very true. For you, as a human, decisions are everything. What you decide to do when you wake up in the morning may be crucial to what you will do later in the day. The same concept applies here."  
"是的，非常真实。作为人类，决定一切。你早上醒来时做出的决定可能对你当天晚些时候要做的事情至关重要。这个概念在这里同样适用。"

Shinji looked at the thing that resembled Asuka exactly and finally said, "I know I've asked this roughly a hundred times by now...but who are you?"  
真嗣看着那个与明日香一模一样的东西，终于说道：“我知道这个问题我已经问了大概一百遍了...但你是谁？”

The pseudo Asuka sighed and said, "You wont know till the end, if you make it there."  
伪明日香叹了口气，说道：“不到最后，你不会知道结果，如果你能走到那一步的话。”

"And what is at the end of everything?"  
“那么，一切的尽头是什么呢？”

The pseudo Asuka smiled slightly and said, "The Tree Of Life."  
伪明日香微微一笑，说道：“生命之树。”

"And what exactly is that?"  
"那究竟是什么？"

"You'll know eventually."  
"你迟早会知道的。"

"Big help...but thanks anyway."  
"真是个大帮助……不过还是谢谢了。"

"The pseudo Asuka seemed rather taken aback and to Shinji, it seemed as though the human it was impersonating let through some very real Asuka like emotions for a moment before she said, "Why the thanks?"  
"伪装的明日香似乎相当吃惊，对真嗣来说，那仿冒者仿佛在那一刻流露出了真正的明日香般的情感，随后她问道：“为什么要谢我？”

"You helped me...sort a few things out, though in a rather disgusting way."  
"你帮我...理清了一些事情，虽然方式相当令人作呕。"

"Fear works best on you humans, and particularly when it governs that girl that your mind wanders over."  
"恐惧对你们人类最为有效，尤其是当它掌控着那个你心中所思的女孩时。"

"I wont be able to sleep thanks to this for a week."  
"因为这事儿，我一周都别想睡个好觉了。"

"Like you were getting much to begin with locked up in the white room anyway."  
"反正你被关在白房间里也没怎么睡过。"

"...Then this is it?" "...那么，这就是结局了吗？"

"...Yes it is, and it will be, for I shall not interfere with this anymore. Though I have one last thing I must ask."  
"...是的，确实如此，而且将会如此，因为我不会再干预这一切。不过，我还有最后一件事必须问。"

"Whats that?" "什么事？"

"Do you understand what your power is, for that is essential for everything that comes after this."  
"你明白你的力量是什么吗？这是接下来一切的关键。"

Shinji stood gazing at the pseudo Asuka for a minute before saying, "If the angels are energy beings, and are able to create and manipulate things, there is one thing that they can't manipulate that humans can..."  
真嗣站在那里凝视着假明日香，过了一会儿才说道：“如果使徒是能量生命体，能够创造和操纵事物，那么有一样东西是他们无法操纵的，而人类却可以……”

"And that is?" “那是什么？”

"Time," said Shinji simply.  
“时间，”真嗣简单地回答道。

The pseudo Asuka continued looking at him for a minute before saying, "Well its close enough for now. You'll learn more about it in time since you've theoretically awakened with the existence of your AT-field. For all intended purposes I suppose you are correct. Humans can control there own time by their decisions. Since you are both human and angel you can govern yours and other peoples time. But only humans, and those close or dear to you."  
伪明日香继续盯着他看了一会儿，然后说道：“好吧，现在这样已经足够接近了。随着你理论上因 AT 力场的存在而觉醒，你会逐渐了解更多。就目前的目的而言，我想你是对的。人类可以通过自己的决定来控制时间。既然你既是人类又是天使，你就能掌控你和他人的时间。但仅限于人类，以及那些与你亲近或重要的人。”

"I got it...I think." “我明白了...大概。”

"I really wonder about that," sighed the pseudo Asuka. "Anyway, time is getting short and you should get back soon."  
“我真的对此感到疑惑，”伪明日香叹了口气，“无论如何，时间不多了，你该尽快回去了。”

"So this is goodbye I guess."  
"看来这就是告别了。"

"Until the rebirth of the Tree of Life and the awakening of Tabris...yes...it is."  
"直到生命之树重生，塔布里斯觉醒...是的...就是这样。"

Shinji nodded and turned his back away from the pseudo Asuka, though he heard her suddenly say something behind him.  
真嗣点点头，背对着假明日香，尽管他听到她在身后突然说了些什么。

"Aren't you going to ask me something?"  
"你不想问我些什么吗？"

"Like what?" "比如什么？"

"'...Who am I?'" "'...我是谁？'"

Shinji paused for a second before he smiled and said, "I'm Shinji Ikari, and thats all I care about."  
真嗣停顿了一下，然后微笑着说：“我是碇真嗣，这就足够了。”

Shinji turned and suddenly the darkness disappeared to be replaced with a blinding whiteness that lit the entire space up. As Shinji disappeared into the whiteness, the pseudo Asuka stood still in his conscious mind before it sighed and said, "Maybe he really has changed, and if he has," here her eyes flash a brief scarlet as she whispered, "Maybe he can usher in the rebirth."  
真嗣转身，突然间黑暗消失，取而代之的是一片耀眼的白色，照亮了整个空间。当真嗣消失在白光中时，伪明日香在他的意识中静止不动，然后叹了口气说：“也许他真的改变了，如果他真的改变了，”她的眼中闪过一抹猩红，低声说道，“也许他能引领重生。”

Without another word she vanished into a thin wisp of nothingness.  
她没有再说一句话，化作一缕虚无消失了。

---

Shinji's eyes flew open as though he had received a sharp electric shock, and quite possibly he had, since Rebecca had slapped him none to gently across the face. Upon seeing that his eyes had finally opened, Rebecca opened her mouth in apology, but Shinji quickly cut her off. He had to move fast.  
真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，仿佛受到了强烈的电击，很可能确实如此，因为丽贝卡毫不客气地扇了他一巴掌。看到他的眼睛终于睁开，丽贝卡张嘴想要道歉，但真嗣迅速打断了她。他必须迅速行动。

"Rebecca how long was I out!"  
"丽贝卡，我昏迷了多久！"

"I-I don't know, maybe thirty seconds at most."  
"我，我不知道，最多可能只有三十秒。"

"Where is the nearest shelter?"  
"最近的避难所在哪里？"

"A few blocks that way," she replied as she gestured with her hand. "But what are you-"  
"那边几个街区，" 她边说边用手比划。"但你这是要做什么？"

"I can't explain now, I promise I will later. Just go there and stay there."  
"我现在解释不了，我保证之后会告诉你。你先去那里待着。"

"What are you-" "你在干什么——"

"Listen," said Shinji as he grabbed her shoulder in a gesture which was both hurriedly and gentle. "I can't say much about what happened just now, probably never will. But you have to trust me on this, I'm going to go somewhere, do something to help you and everyone. When I'm done I'll come back and see you...and I'll bring a friend if possible."  
"听着，" 真嗣说着，急切而温柔地抓住她的肩膀。"刚才发生的事我不能多说，可能永远都不会说。但这件事上你必须相信我，我要去某个地方，做些事情来帮你和大家。等我完成了，我会回来见你……如果可能的话，我会带个朋友一起来。"

"That girl that you like?"  
"你喜欢的那个女孩？"

Before Shinji even bothered thinking about what she said, he replied, "Yes, I'll bring Asuka."  
在真嗣还没来得及思考她的话之前，他就回答道：“是的，我会带明日香来。”

"So her names Asu-" "所以她叫明日-"

Shinji quickly cut her off again by saying, "Not now...Go, just Go!"  
真嗣迅速再次打断她，说道：“现在不行……走吧，快走！”

Rebecca looked down at his face, which wasn't all that far from hers really and said, "Its a promise."  
丽贝卡低头看着他的脸，其实离她的并不远，说道：“这是承诺。”

Bringing him into a one armed hug, she let her hair fall over onto his face and past his shoulders.  
她用一只手臂搂住他，让头发垂落在他脸上，越过他的肩膀。

"You stay safe Shinji, you're a good kid."  
"你要保重，真嗣，你是个好孩子。"

"I'm not a kid." "我不是孩子了。"

"No...I don't suppose you are."  
"不……我想你确实不是了。"

Straightening up, Rebecca nodded and said, "I'll make you and this Asuka something special, instead of just grabbing something out of the refrigerator next time."  
挺直身子，丽贝卡点头说道：“下次我会为你和这个明日香做点特别的，而不是随便从冰箱里拿点东西。”

Shinji nodded and smiled slightly, before he turned around and started sprinting in the opposite direction.  
真嗣点点头，微微一笑，然后转身开始朝相反方向跑去。

Rebecca watched his retreating back for a second before she too proceeded on her way.  
丽贝卡注视着他的背影片刻，随后也继续前行。

Meanwhile, Zeruel touched down in Tokyo-3 and started the destruction that awaited the city.  
与此同时，零尔降落在东京-3，开始了对这座城市的毁灭。

**Very different then what I've done before as you probably see...  
这与我之前所做的截然不同，你大概能看出来...**

### Chapter 17: Tragic Reunions  
第 17 章：悲剧重逢

**Part two of my Birthday bash thingy (don't ask!) Anyway refer to chapter before this for important stuff and blah blah blah OH! Right. I'm gonna be working on another amv soon (wow its been almost a year since my last one) and its gonna be SnS (Shakugan no Shana) and if you think about asking whether its YujiXShana or YujiXYoshida I will personally hunt you down and do...well unpleasant things no doubt. Anyway this was finished literally ten minutes ago so its still rough. Later I'll update a version with corrections.  
我的生日庆典系列之二（别问！）总之，请参考上一章的重要内容和诸如此类的东西。哦对了！我很快会开始制作另一个 AMV（天哪，距离上一个已经快一年了），这次是关于《灼眼的夏娜》（SnS）的，如果你在想问是悠二 X 夏娜还是悠二 X 吉田，我会亲自找上门，然后……嗯，毫无疑问是不愉快的事情。总之，这个是十分钟前刚完成的，所以还很粗糙。稍后我会更新一个修正版。**

Shinji found himself leaning against a lamppost clutching a stitch at his side. He had not realized how far he had actually wandered since he had left Nerv and only now, saw that he was hopelessly lost. Whats more, Rebecca had been quite right in saying that this was one part of Tokyo-3 that you would not want to wander in. Shinji had already had several encounters with what he expected were gangs. One group of guys got the idea that he was some rich bureaucrats son, and attempted to kidnap him. Shinji only managed to get away by convincing them he wasn't, and that if they didn't hurry, all the shelters would be full. Shinji got the impression that they were all high school dropouts, seeing as how they weren't very bright.  
真嗣发现自己正倚靠在一根路灯柱上，紧抓着侧腹的疼痛。他并未意识到自从离开 NERV 后，自己究竟走了多远，直到此刻，他才意识到自己已彻底迷失了方向。更糟糕的是，丽贝卡说得没错，这是东京-3 中你不愿随意闯入的区域。真嗣已经遭遇了几次他认为可能是帮派的团伙。其中一伙人误以为他是某个富有的官僚子弟，企图绑架他。真嗣仅凭说服他们自己并非如此，并警告他们若不快点，所有避难所都将满员，才得以逃脱。真嗣觉得他们都是高中辍学生，毕竟他们看起来并不聪明。

He had no idea how much time had passed since he had left Rebecca at the cafe, only that since then, the angel had descended on a different part of Tokyo-3 and was started to wreak havoc.  
他不知道自离开咖啡馆与丽贝卡分别后过去了多久，只知道从那时起，天使降临在东京-3 的另一区域，开始肆虐破坏。

Breathing heavily while leaning against the lamp post, with one hand clutched against the stitch in his side, the other one he ran along the back of his head. He had forgotten that just before he had his latest vision, he seemed to have accidentally bashed his head on the brick exterior of the cafe. Now blood was caked into his hair and he could feel a sizable lump where he had hit his head.  
他倚着路灯柱大口喘气，一手紧按着侧腹的疼痛，另一手则抚过脑后。他忘了就在最近一次预知梦之前，自己似乎不小心撞到了咖啡馆的砖墙上。现在，血迹凝结在发间，他能感觉到撞击处鼓起了一个不小的肿块。

'Well,' he thought suddenly, 'if this is the only injury I get today, I suppose I'll be considered lucky.'  
“好吧，”他突然想道，“如果今天我只受这点伤，那我大概算是幸运的了。”

Removing his hand from the back of his head, he pushed himself off the lamppost, and prepared to run as fast as his body was willing to move the rest of the way to gate three of Nerv.  
他把手从脑后移开，撑着路灯柱站直身子，准备尽可能快地跑完剩下的路，直奔 NERV 的三号门。

Misato wasn't sure what she should do.  
美里不确定自己该做什么。

It had been hours since Shinji had left the facilities and it was almost like the angel had been specifically waiting for him to leave so it could attack. With one pilot gone, and the other out of commission, there weren't many options that she could choose from. Least likely of them, to ask the JSDF for help. That would bring shame to Nerv, and herself. Rei was able, but Unit 00 arm had not been repaired since the angel Bardiel attacked. Attacking with it right now would be nothing short of suicide. She had sent out a search team when she received confirmation of pattern blue, but that had not been long ago. Shinji could be miles away by now.  
真嗣离开设施已经好几个小时了，仿佛那个天使专门等着他离开才发动攻击。一名驾驶员已经离开，另一名又无法行动，她能选择的方案寥寥无几。最不可能的，就是向自卫队求助。那会给 NERV 和她自己带来耻辱。绫波可以出击，但零号机的手臂自巴迪尔天使袭击后还未修复。现在用它攻击无异于自杀。她收到蓝色模式的确认后便派出了搜索队，但那并不久远。真嗣现在可能已经远在数英里之外了。

Suddenly her phone rang. 突然，她的电话响了。

Looking at it rather hesitantly, rather afraid that it might be the commander, she finally picked it up and was surprised to find Asuka's voice on the other end of the line.  
她犹豫地看着电话，相当担心可能是指挥官打来的，最终还是拿起了电话，惊讶地发现是明日香的声音。

"Misato, what the hell is going on? Is it an angel attack?"  
“美里，到底怎么回事？是使徒袭击吗？”

"...Yes it is, and could you not keep this line busy-"  
“……是的，而且你能别占着线吗——”

"Misato?" said Asuka quietly as she cut her off.  
"美里？" 明日香轻声打断她。

"What?" "什么？"

"Send me out there, I can help."  
"让我出去，我能帮忙。"

"No, absolutely not!" replied Misato with such force that Asuka moved here ear away from the end of the receiver.  
"不行，绝对不行！" 美里回答得如此坚决，以至于明日香将耳朵从听筒旁移开。

"Asuka, you are in no condition to pilot, not after what happened at Matsushiro. We don't even know what your mental state will be like if you enter Unit 0-"  
"明日香，你现在不适合驾驶，尤其是在松代事件之后。我们甚至不知道你进入零号机后精神状态会如何。"

"I'm Fine! More importantly you need me to stall until Shinji returns."  
"我没事！更重要的是，你需要我拖延时间直到真嗣回来。"

"Asuka I-" "明日香一号-"

"He will return!" "他会回来的！"

"It isn't a matter of wether he will or not, I still can't let you leave the ward."  
"这不是他会不会的问题，我还是不能让你离开病房。"

"Then I'll deal with it myself!" shouted Asuka as she hung up the phone.  
"那我就自己解决！" 明日香挂断电话时喊道。

Misato was stunned as she heard the click as Asuka hung up the phone. She could not believe how reckless Asuka was being.  
听到明日香挂断电话的咔嗒声，美里愣住了。她无法相信明日香竟然如此鲁莽。

Quickly switching to a different line, she dialed the number that would take her to the nurse on Asuka's ward. As the nurse answered it she was about to give the standard greeting when Misato cut her off.  
她迅速切换到另一条线路，拨打了通往明日香病房护士的号码。护士接起电话，正要给出标准问候时，美里打断了她。

"Quickly, go to the room where the pilot of Unit 02 is located, she may be trying to leave. Restrain and sedate her if you have to."  
“快，去 02 号机驾驶员所在的房间，她可能正试图离开。如有必要，限制并给她注射镇静剂。”

After several minutes of worrying the nurse got back on the phone and said that they had gotten to her just as she was leaving the room. She had tried to escape them, but they had managed to sedate her properly. Currently she was resting peacefully in the hospital room.  
几分钟后，护士忧心忡忡地再次拿起电话，说她们正好在她离开房间时赶到。明日香试图逃脱，但她们成功地给她注射了适量的镇静剂。目前她正在病房里安静地休息。

"What was all this about?" asked the nurse after several seconds of silence from Misato. "First that friend of hers leaves and takes her security card. Now she's all the sudden trying to leave the ward and go back to piloting when she's in no condition. Major Misato...I'm sorry if I'm overstepping my bounds but I have to say-"  
"这都是怎么回事？" 护士在沉默了几秒钟后问道。"先是她的朋友离开并带走了她的安全卡。现在她突然想离开病房，回到驾驶舱，而她的身体状况根本不允许。美里少校...如果我逾越了界限，我很抱歉，但我必须说——"

"I know nurse...just...keep an eye on her, and let me know when she wakes up. Keep an eye on her at all times. She can...be rather stubborn at times."  
"我知道，护士...只是...密切关注她，她醒来时通知我。随时都要留意她。她有时...相当固执。"

"So I've seen," the nurse mumbled before a click signaled her hanging the phone up.  
"我见识过了，" 护士低声嘟囔，随后电话挂断的咔嗒声响起。

As Misato hung her own phone up, she paused as she thought of a possible idea that Asuka had given her. Quickly punching in the numbers on her phone, she was directed to the science department, and Ritsuko's office.  
当美里挂断自己的电话时，她停顿了一下，想起了明日香给她提的一个可能的点子。她迅速按下电话号码，被转接到了科学部门，以及律子的办公室。

"Hello, this is Ritsu-" “你好，我是律子——”

"Ritsuko, is it possible to outfit Unit 02 with the dummy plug?"  
“律子，有可能给零二号机装上模拟插入栓吗？”

"Theoretically it is, but with what happened with Unit 01 I can't be one hundred percent sure that it will-"  
"理论上是的，但鉴于 01 号机发生的事情，我无法百分百确定它会——"

"Just do it, we don't have many options."  
"就这么做吧，我们没有太多选择。"

"Have you asked the commander?"  
"你问过指挥官了吗？"

Misato hesitated and admitted, "No, I haven't."  
美里犹豫了一下，承认道：“没有，我没有。”

"Don't you think-" “你不觉得——”

"No I don't! We don't have any options left, and if I get canned for this at least I know I tried to alleviate the problem."  
“不，我不觉得！我们已经没有其他选择了，就算我因此被炒鱿鱼，至少我知道我尝试过解决问题。”

A pause over the phone line until finally, "Okay Misato, I'll do this, but as I said I can't guarantee that it will work."  
电话那头一阵沉默，最终，“好吧，美里，我会试试，但就像我说的，我不敢保证这会有用。”

"Just try, I'm out of options..."  
“尽力就好，我已经无计可施了……”

"Right," replied Ritsuko as she hung up the phone.  
“好的，”律子回答着挂断了电话。

Misato leaned back in her chair and was seriously considering throwing the phone across the room. What should she do if the dummy plug doesn't work? Should she really consider sending Rei out? What about Asuka?  
美里靠在椅背上，认真考虑着是否要把电话扔出房间。如果傀儡系统失效了怎么办？她真的要考虑派绫波出去吗？那明日香呢？

"God Damn it!" she yelled into the open air.  
“该死！”她对着空旷的空气大喊。

Slamming her fists down on her desk the only thing she succeeded in was splitting the palm of her hand open and leaving a red welt on her other hand. Why now of all times did an angel have to appear, and one as powerful as this. They had received reports that its AT-field was able to destroy an entire city block and leave a gaping crater too boot. What if something like that attempted to invade the Geofront. Could the layers of reinforced steel hold up against something like that? Misato really didn't think so.  
她猛地用拳头砸向桌子，结果只是把手掌划破了，另一只手上留下了一道红印。为什么偏偏在这个时候出现使徒，而且还是这么强大的一个。他们收到报告说它的 AT 力场能够摧毁整个街区，并留下一个大坑。如果这样的东西试图入侵地表层，那些加固的钢层能抵挡得住吗？美里真的不这么认为。

As Misato thought of these things the phone rang once again on her desk. She was tempted to smash the thing against the wall next to her, but instead picked up the phone and said in as strong a voice she could muster, "Yes what is it?"  
当美里思考着这些事情时，桌上的电话再次响起。她很想将那东西砸向旁边的墙壁，但最终还是拿起电话，尽可能用坚定的声音说道：“什么事？”

"The angel had just passed the third defensive line that we've implemented. Conventional weapons aren't doing a thing."  
“使徒刚刚通过了我们的第三道防线。常规武器根本不起作用。”

'No shit,' thought Misato. 'Its only to slow it down, but that doesn't even seem to be working.'  
“废话，”美里心想，“本意只是为了延缓它的速度，但似乎连这都做不到。”

"Abandon the fourth and five lines then, I don't want anybody else dying if we can't even slow the damn thing down."  
"放弃第四和第五行吧，如果我们连减缓那东西的速度都做不到，我不希望再有人丧命了。"

Once again her phone line went dead with a click, but this time it took her several seconds to replace the receiver as she continued to hold it against her ear.  
电话线再次咔嗒一声断了，但这次她花了好几秒钟才放下听筒，依旧将它贴在耳边。

"Whats this..." "这是什么..."

Water droplets were started to fall on the skirt she was wearing as though she had just stepped out of the shower.  
水滴开始落在她所穿的裙子上，仿佛她刚从淋浴间出来。

'Ah I see,' she thought as she realized it was her own tears. The incompetence of her actions and the hurt that she had put Shinji, Asuka, and everyone else suddenly welled up in her until they came spilling forth. Whats more...she finally realized something. She didn't care whether Shinji was angel, human, or something in between. She just wanted him to be here and thought of this is what its like to be a mother coursed through her. Without realizing it, she had been attempting to play the part of a mother to both Shinji and Asuka, both of which had barely known there mothers; in Shinji's case almost non-existent. And yet she had hardly been there for them when they truly needed it. It had been one thing after another which she had taken care of, but it was themselves that were forced to support each other. Maybe that was why Asuka and Shinji were both able to trust each other so deeply. But she hadn't trusted Shinji, no matter how much she wanted to deny that fact.  
“啊，我明白了，”她意识到那是自己的泪水。她对行动的无能和对真嗣、明日香以及所有人造成的伤害突然涌上心头，直到泪水倾泻而出。更重要的是……她终于明白了一件事。她不在乎真嗣是天使、人类，还是介于两者之间。她只希望他在这里，并意识到这就像成为母亲的感觉贯穿了她。不知不觉中，她一直在试图扮演真嗣和明日香的母亲角色，他们俩几乎都不知道自己的母亲；在真嗣的情况下几乎不存在。然而，当他们真正需要时，她几乎没有在他们身边。一件又一件事她都处理了，但他们被迫互相支持。也许这就是为什么明日香和真嗣能够如此深地信任对方。但她没有信任真嗣，无论她多么想否认这个事实。

"We need Shinji," she finally said. "We need him because he can make a difference, we need him because he is truly strong, we need him because-" here she paused and after a slight hitch in her breath said, "I need because he's like family to me..."  
"我们需要真嗣，"她终于说道。"我们需要他，因为他能带来改变，我们需要他，因为他真的强大，我们需要他，因为——" 她顿了顿，深吸一口气后继续说，"我需要他，因为他就像我的家人一样..."

After reconciling her own feelings for him, she put her head on her desk and cried until her eyes turned red, unaware of just how close Shinji was.  
在理清自己对他的感情后，她将头靠在桌上，哭到眼睛通红，却未察觉真嗣离她有多近。

---

Whether because of his heightened perception as being partially angel, or because his unconscious mind simply catalogued a good portion of everything he has seen, he was able to recognize specific landmarks and slowly make his way back to gate three of Nerv, but it had taken a long time; an hour most likely.  
或许是得益于他作为半天使的敏锐感知，又或许是他潜意识里早已将所见之物一一记录，他能够辨认出特定的地标，并慢慢找回了通往 NERV 第三入口的路，但这花费了很长时间；大概有一个小时。

The stitch that he had had in his side before felt now as though somebody had drilled a wooden stake through his kidney.  
之前他侧腹的那阵刺痛，现在感觉像是有人在他肾脏里钉了一根木桩。

Leaning against a building, just across the street from where gate three was, he got the iron taste of blood in his mouth, the kind you get if you suddenly exert your body too much. Swallowing loudly, while trying to rid himself of that iron taste, he looked across the street at gate 3 and suddenly wondered how he was supposed to get in.  
他靠在一栋建筑上，就在三号门对面，嘴里尝到了血的铁锈味，那种突然过度用力身体时会有的感觉。他大声吞咽着，试图摆脱那股铁味，同时望向街对面的三号门，突然疑惑自己该怎么进去。

Tokyo-3 had been locked down sometime ago, meaning that many things electronic had been shut down, including the automatic steel doors of Nerv that normally only required a card. There was a manual override that he could attempt to access, but unfortunately it required more than one person to use, and he could open the steel door by himself...so then-  
第三新东京市早已进入封锁状态，这意味着许多电子设备都已关闭，包括通常只需刷卡就能开启的 NERV 自动钢门。有一个手动重置装置他可以尝试，但不幸的是，这需要不止一个人来操作，而他一个人是无法打开钢门的...那么接下来——

He suddenly looked down at his right hand and realized how dumb he was. Clenching it suddenly into a fist he smiled and thought, "I can open it with my AT-field."  
他突然低头看向自己的右手，意识到自己有多傻。他猛地握紧拳头，微笑着想：“我可以用 AT 力场打开它。”

Suddenly, as though he had been injected with some sort of drug all feelings of tiredness left him. Straightening up, he quickly walked over to the gate, completely ignoring both security cameras in the process, and planted both feet firmly in front of the door.  
突然间，仿佛被注射了某种药物，所有的疲惫感都消失了。他挺直身子，快步走向大门，完全无视了过程中的监控摄像头，稳稳地将双脚立在门前。

'I want it to open,' he thought, 'but I don't want to completely destroy it.'  
“我希望它打开，”他想，“但我不想彻底毁了它。”

Eventually settling on how he wanted to go about 'opening' the door he generated a simple, flat, AT-field that was just large enough to admit him through. Finding a point in the steel door which he thought suitable, he pressed the AT-field against it, and applied pressure to it. Eventually the steel door started to give, as Shinji could feel it being forced outwards, into the small tunnel that would bring him to the elevator of gate three. Adding a little more strength to it, he felt the small section where his AT-field was position implode on itself as the metal crumpled like a piece of paper and was forcefully sent flying into the small tunnel. The edges of the steel door that had come in contact with the edge of the AT-field looked as though the had been cleaning cut with a pair of scissors.  
最终，他决定如何'打开'这扇门，生成了一个简单、平坦的 AT 力场，刚好足够他通过。在钢门上找到一个他认为合适的位置，他将 AT 力场压上去，并施加压力。最终，钢门开始屈服，真嗣能感觉到它被强行向外推，进入通往三号门电梯的小隧道。再加大一点力量，他感觉到 AT 力场所在的小部分区域自行坍塌，金属像纸片一样被压皱，并被猛地抛入小隧道。与 AT 力场边缘接触的钢门边缘看起来就像被剪刀干净利落地剪开一样。

With no time to admire the cleanliness of his work he quickly rushed to the elevator and started hammering the down button in frustration. That short minute of waiting almost felt like an eternity.  
没有时间欣赏他的工作成果，他迅速冲向电梯，开始愤怒地猛按下行按钮。那短暂的等待几乎感觉像是一个永恒。

"What do you mean it didn't work?" asked an angry Misato. She had finally gotten control of her emotions only to find out that Unit 02 rejected the dummy plug.  
“你什么意思，它没起作用？”愤怒的美里问道。她终于控制住了自己的情绪，却发现 2 号机拒绝了模拟插入栓。

"I told you that I was afraid of this happening," replied Ritsuko with a slight edge in her voice. "We got all the way to phase three when Unit 02 realized it wasn't Asuka piloting it. At first we thought it was going to allow it, but something happened with the dummy plug. An anomaly suddenly appeared inside the entry plug and the dummy plug attempted to terminate it. Whatever it was, it crushed the dummy plug. We are just now managing to extract it from the Unit."  
"我告诉过你，我担心这种情况会发生，" 赤木律子回答道，语气中带着一丝尖锐。"我们一直进行到第三阶段，这时 02 号机意识到驾驶它的不是明日香。起初我们以为它会接受，但随后出现了问题，模拟插入栓试图终止异常。无论那是什么，它压碎了模拟插入栓。我们现在才设法将其从机体中取出。"

"Damn it! I want a better explanation than that!"  
"该死！我需要一个比这更详细的解释！"

"I don't know what happened. The readings went off the scale, the temperature of the LCL fluid went well over the boiling point, and the synchronization was forcefully cut by the Eva. I suppose its a good thing we did this before we tried having Asuka pilot it again, but it almost seemed as though something was controlling it."  
"我不知道发生了什么。读数超出了范围，LCL 液体的温度远超沸点，同步率也被 EVA 强行切断。幸好我们在让明日香再次驾驶之前做了这个测试，但几乎像是有什么东西在控制它。"

Misato let these words sink before she said, "Could this have anything to do with Asuka's-"  
美里让这些话沉淀片刻，才开口道：“这会不会和明日香有什么关系——”

"No, it wasn't her. It was very brief, but we managed to get a reading of pattern blue inhabiting the Eva before we lost it."  
“不，不是她。虽然很短暂，但我们确实在失去信号前检测到了蓝色模式存在于 Eva 中。”

Misato sucked in a large gust of air at Ritsuko's words. "Are you saying that Unit 02 is infected by an angel?"  
听到律子的话，美里猛地吸了一大口气。“你是说 02 号机被使徒感染了？”

"I can't be sure, but until we run more tests we can't let Asuka, or anybody for that matter step inside the entry plug."  
"我不敢肯定，但在我们进行更多测试之前，我们不能让明日香，或者任何人进入插入栓。"

"Ritsuko...could this have something to do with the angel we fought the other day?"  
"律子...这会不会和我们前几天战斗的那个使徒有关？"

"I don't see how. If that angel did in fact briefly possess Asuka, I don't see how it could have moved from Unit 03 with her in it, to Unit 02 without us knowing; plus she hasn't even had any contact with Unit 02 since the accident with Unit 03. No...this was probably a different angel."  
"我看不出有什么关联。如果那个使徒确实短暂地附身了明日香，我不明白它怎么可能从 03 号机转移到 02 号机，而我们却毫不知情；况且她在 03 号机事故后根本没有接触过 02 号机。不...这可能是另一个使徒。"

There was a rather pregnant pause before Misato said, "Two? Are we dealing with two angels?"  
一阵颇为意味深长的沉默之后，美里开口道：“两个？我们是在对付两个使徒吗？”

"I don't know. I've had restraints placed on Unit 02 and am monitoring the nerve impulses, looking for anything that should show a sign of activation."  
“我不清楚。我已经给二号机上了限制装置，并正在监测神经脉冲，寻找任何可能显示激活迹象的信号。”

Misato sighed; just one more thing to add onto her troubles today.  
美里叹了口气；今天又多了一件烦心事。

"Keep me updated on this Ritsuko...and while I'm at it I'm classing Unit 02 as the tenth angel until I know more about this. If at any time you feel that it is being truly possessed by an angel, I give you the authority to destroy it."  
「随时向我汇报情况，律子……还有，在我了解更多之前，我将把二号机列为第十使徒。如果任何时候你觉得它真的被使徒附身了，我授权你摧毁它。」

Ritsuko was rather surprised at the sureness in Misato's voice at her own decision but agreed with her anyway.  
律子对美里声音中的坚定感到有些惊讶，但还是同意了她的决定。

With that taken care of Misato hurriedly dialed another number and was put through to a Nerv outpost close to where the angel was.  
处理完这些后，美里急忙拨打了另一个号码，接通了离使徒所在地不远的 NERV 前哨站。

"Whats the status of the angel?"  
“天使的状况如何？”

"It just passed the fifth defensive line and is now proceeding...over the mountains it looks like. Its heading towards the Geofront."  
“它刚刚通过了第五道防线，现在正继续前进……看起来是越过山脉。它正朝地底都市前进。”

"Whats the status of our defensive forces."  
“我们的防御部队情况怎样？”

"Poor, if we don't bring in the JSDF we wont be able to formulate a proper defense line."  
"糟糕，如果我们不请来自卫队，就无法建立有效的防线。"

'Shit,' thought Misato as she bit down on a nail.  
'该死，' 美里咬着指甲心想。

"Time left until the angel reaches the Geofront?"  
"天使到达地底都市还有多少时间？"

"Time estimated at...ten minutes or so."  
"估计时间...大约十分钟左右。"

"Tch...I suppose I don't have any other-"  
"啧...我想我别无选择-"

Misato suddenly saw a blinking red light flashing on and off on her phone as somebody else was trying to get through the line. Turning back to the task at hand she said into the phone, "If no other options are available I'm going to get the JSDF to drop a bomb on the angel. Evacuate to a safe distance and await further orders there."  
美里突然看到手机上有一个红色闪烁的指示灯在闪烁，似乎有人正在试图接通电话。她转回手头的工作，对着电话说：“如果没有其他选择，我会让自卫队投下一枚炸弹来对付使徒。撤离到安全距离，并在那里等待进一步的指令。”

"Yes major!" "是，少校！"

With that, the soldier hung up and Misato was able to switch lines.  
说完，士兵挂断了电话，美里得以切换线路。

"What is it?" "什么事？"

"Err Major...we just got an unauthorized entry over here, which makes no sense as the steel doors shouldn't be operating, and the manual override is impossible for-"  
"呃，少校……我们这里检测到一次未经授权的进入，这说不通，因为钢门不应该在运作，手动重置也不可能——"

"What is this? I don't have time for-"  
"这是什么？我没时间搞这个——"

"The security cameras were able to pick up a feed, but its unclear with lots of static."  
"监控摄像头捕捉到了画面，但由于大量静电干扰，不太清晰。"

"Where is this?" "这是哪儿？"

"Gate three, we actually think that-"  
三号门，我们真的认为——

Misato suddenly dropped the phone in surprise. Was it?  
美里突然惊慌失措地丢掉了电话。难道是？

Hurriedly picking it back up, she scrambled to place the receiver next to her ear and finally managed to say, "What is it! Is it Shinji!"  
她急忙捡起电话，慌乱地将听筒贴近耳朵，终于勉强说道：“怎么了！是小真嗣吗！”

"We think so Major. We have a picture of the pilot of Unit 01 here, and the camera seems to show an accurate image of him, though it is kinda hard to tell at first glance. Also the camera picked up that same flash of orange that we had seen earlier and-"  
"我们认为是的，少校。我们这里有 01 号机驾驶员的照片，摄像头似乎捕捉到了他的准确形象，虽然乍一看有点难以辨认。此外，摄像头还捕捉到了之前我们见过的那种橙色闪光，而且——"

The guard suddenly got nothing but a dial tone, as Misato had thrown the phone down and ran out of her office.  
警卫突然只听到电话忙音，因为美里已经扔下电话，跑出了她的办公室。

---

Shinji almost felt that sending the elevator into a free fall would have saved him a lot of time when the elevator suddenly stopped and opened for him.  
真嗣几乎觉得让电梯自由落体会省下他很多时间，这时电梯突然停下并为他打开了门。

He stepped out hesitantly, positive that the cameras above had picked up his profile and what he had done. He had almost expected armed guards to be waiting for him with their guns drawn and laser sights trained on him. He was rather shocked that not a soul had been waiting for his return, but then again, he figured that they were all probably too busy.  
他犹豫着走了出来，确信头顶的摄像头已经捕捉到了他的身影和他所做的一切。他几乎以为会有武装警卫等着他，枪已上膛，激光瞄准器对准了他。他相当惊讶竟然没有一个人在等他回来，但转念一想，他猜他们可能都太忙了。

Stepping out of the elevator, he looked around and saw that the camera he had destroyed earlier hadn't been replaced and had not even been moved out of the way. It was still laying there on the ground, crumpled and broken in a dejected way. Shinji still couldn't believe how powerful his AT-field was, and that he was able to project it over a distance.  
走出电梯，他环顾四周，发现之前他破坏的摄像头还没有被更换，甚至没有被移开。它依旧躺在地上，皱巴巴、支离破碎，一副颓然的样子。真嗣仍然不敢相信自己的 AT 力场有多强大，以及他能够将其投射到一定距离之外。

Passing the broken camera, he entered the four-way intersection of hallways and was just looking to his left in the direction that Asuka was when he heard running feet coming towards him. Tensing up quickly, he flexed his right hand, ready to project and AT-field in front of him to act as a shield if he had to when he was able to ascertain that the person running towards him was wearing shoes where the heel was raised off the ground, making it almost certain that it was a woman. Relaxing slightly, he continued looking down the middle hallway until he finally saw Misato come out of the darkness.  
递过破损的相机，他走进了四通八达的走廊交汇处，正朝左方望去，那是明日香所在的方向，突然听到急促的脚步声向他逼近。他迅速绷紧身体，右手蓄力，准备随时在前方展开 AT 力场作为盾牌，这时他辨认出跑来的人穿着后跟抬起的鞋子，几乎可以确定是个女人。稍稍放松警惕，他继续沿着中间的走廊望去，终于在黑暗中看到了美里现身。

It seemed that she had ran most of the way there, considering she had beads of sweat dripping down he face.  
看来她是一路狂奔至此，因为她的脸上挂满了汗珠。

Shinji was rather surprised to see her, and unsure of what he should say in regards to her presence.  
真嗣见到她颇为惊讶，对于该如何回应她的出现感到不知所措。

"Hey," he finally said which sounded stupid even in his own mind.  
"嘿，"他终于开口，连自己都觉得这话蠢极了。

"Hey," replied Misato, thinking the exact same thing as Shinji.  
"嘿，"美里回应道，心里想的和真嗣一模一样。

Shinji felt as though he was unable to look at Misato and instead settled on looking down at his feet. Suddenly a loud shock wave vibrated the entirety of the Geofront, though it didn't seem to phase either Shinji or Misato.  
真嗣感觉自己无法直视美里，于是低头盯着自己的脚。突然，一声巨响震撼了整个 Geofront，但似乎并未影响到真嗣和美里。

Finally Shinji got up the courage to say what he had been meaning to say when he saw Misato again.  
最终，真嗣鼓起勇气，准备在再次见到美里时说出他一直想说的话。

"I'm sorry...for leaving."  
“对不起……我离开了。”

Misato looked at him hesitantly before she said, "I'm sorry too Shinji, because I didn't believe in you...and yet Asuka did."  
美里犹豫地看着他，然后说：“我也对不起你，真嗣，因为我没有相信你……而明日香却相信了。”

"Eh?"

"Asuka held onto the fact that you would return...truthfully I thought that you had really gone. I...feel so ashamed of that thought...I-"  
"明日香一直抱着你会回来的信念...说实话，我以为你真的离开了。我...为那个想法感到如此羞愧...我-"

"Misato..." "美里..."

Wiping her face which was slowly started generate salty tears, she asked, "So, did you come to an understand?"  
她擦去脸上渐渐涌出的咸涩泪水，问道：“那么，你们达成理解了吗？”

Shinji nodded and said, "Yeah...I'm Shinji Ikari, and nothing else. As for why I pilot Eva...I honestly don't know still. But I feel that as long as everybody is alive and safe, it doesn't really matter."  
真嗣点点头，说道：“嗯……我是碇真嗣，仅此而已。至于为什么驾驶 EVA……我到现在也真的不知道。但我觉得只要大家都活着，都安全，那就无所谓了。”

"Shin-" "真-

"Is Asuka okay!" he asked suddenly.  
“明日香还好吗！”他突然问道。

"Wha-" "什-"

"Is she safe? Is she still in her hospital room? She hasn't been moved somewhere else has she?"  
“她安全吗？还在医院病房里吗？她没被转移到别的地方吧？”

"Shinji she's perfectly fine. A little restless I suppose but fine."  
"真嗣，她完全没事。可能有点不安分，但还好。"

Immense relief seemed to wash over Shinji face as another shockwave rocked the Geofront and this time some of the lights in the hallways flickered and went out.  
巨大的宽慰似乎涌上了真嗣的脸庞，与此同时，又一波冲击波震撼了地底都市，这次走廊里的部分灯光闪烁了几下便熄灭了。

Realizing that they both had been staying idle for too long, and that they would have more time to talk later, they started heading in different directions, when Shinji turned and said, "Hey, Misato?"  
意识到两人已经闲待太久，而且之后还有时间交谈，他们开始朝不同方向走去，这时真嗣转过身说：“嘿，美里？”

Misato turned towards him with a rather exasperated expression on her face, she asked, "What?"  
美里转向他，脸上带着相当恼怒的表情，问道：“什么？”

"Give this to Asuka, I'd like to give it back myself...but." Shinji looked rather forlorn here, almost as though he didn't know whether he would see her again.  
“把这个交给明日香，我想亲自还给她...但是。”真嗣看起来相当沮丧，几乎像是不知道自己是否还能再见到她。

Putting the card down on the cold marmoleum floor, he placed a finger on it and flicked it outwards, sending it spiraling in Misato's direction.  
他将卡片放在冰冷的大理石地板上，用手指按住并向外一弹，让它旋转着朝美里的方向飞去。

As it came towards Misato, she quickly bent down and placed her cut palm down on it so it wouldn't soar past her. However as she stood back up to ask Shinji what he planned on doing, she saw that he was already gone.  
当它向美里靠近时，她迅速弯腰，将割伤的手掌按在上面，以免它从她身边飞过。然而，当她站起身来想问真嗣打算做什么时，却发现他已经不见了。

---

He didn't know what was going to await him during this battle, so at best, he didn't want to have any regrets, but it looked like he might already be having one.  
他不知道这场战斗中会遇到什么，所以最好是不留遗憾，但看起来他可能已经有一个了。

He was torn between his decision of not visiting Asuka first before he left to pilot Unit 01, but something in the back of his mind told him it was best to not see her. If he did...well, he might of had second thoughts about his decision.  
他在离开驾驶初号机之前是否先去看望明日香的决策之间犹豫不决，但内心深处有个声音告诉他最好不要见她。如果他见了...嗯，他可能会对自己的决定产生疑虑。

He had noticed it before, but never gave any thought towards it and only now noticed what he had felt when he got emotional over the angel Sahaquiel dead body. It was something of a sixth sense he supposed, because somehow or another, he was related to all the angels; he just didn't know how. What he must have felt before was something like an emotional outburst, where the angel part of him was showing remorse at its brothers death and how it had instrumented that death. Now though, his sixth sense was going completely haywire at this angel Zeruel. If he had to describe it, monster would be the most accurate description. Its AT-field seemed to be immensely powerful with almost no weakness in sight.  
他之前就注意到了这一点，但从未深思过，直到此刻才意识到自己在天使萨哈基尔的尸体前情绪激动的原因。这或许是一种第六感，因为他与所有天使都有着某种联系，只是他自己并不清楚具体是如何。之前他感受到的，应该是一种情感爆发，他体内的天使部分为兄弟的死亡及其导致的悲剧感到悲痛。而现在，面对天使杰鲁尔，他的第六感完全失控了。如果要形容的话，最贴切的词就是“怪物”。它的 AT 力场似乎异常强大，几乎看不到任何弱点。

It was because of this that he didn't want to see Asuka. He didn't want to feel regret of seeing her and getting her hopes up, just to find out that he had died by the angel. But at the same time he was feeling regret in his heart for _not_ seeing her. These conflicting emotions had coursed through him as he had waited in the elevator, but now he felt that his decision of having Misato return it to he seemed like the right one.  
正因为如此，他不想见到明日香。他不想因为见到她而感到后悔，不想让她抱有希望，结果却发现他已被天使夺去生命。但与此同时，他心中也充满了未见她的悔恨。这些矛盾的情感在他等待电梯时涌动，但现在他觉得让美里将它归还给他的决定似乎是正确的。

As he turned a corner in the white hallways he suddenly came to a halting stop as a large portion of the ceiling had caved in. Apparently the angel had already penetrated the steel layers separating the Geofront from Tokyo-3 and was already starting to rip apart the landscape.  
当他转过白色走廊的拐角时，突然停了下来，因为一大块天花板已经坍塌。显然，天使已经穿透了将第三新东京市与地底都市隔开的钢铁层，并开始撕裂这片土地。

As Shinji prepared to push the debris out of his way with his AT-field, he noticed that somebody that looked like a soldier had been crushed by the ceiling and was leaking blood out from many part of his body. Recognizing the signs of death all to well, Shinji shook his head and crushed the fallen tiles and sheetrock out of his way so that he could move on.  
当真嗣准备用 AT 力场推开障碍物时，他注意到一个看似士兵的人被天花板压碎，从身体的许多部位流出血液。对死亡的迹象再熟悉不过，真嗣摇了摇头，将掉落的瓷砖和石膏板碾碎，以便继续前进。

Obeying what could very well have been Shinji's last wish, Misato entered Asuka's hospital room to return her security card. Asuka was still heavily sedated though and even though her eyes were open, they didn't show that she even recognized Misato.  
遵从这很可能是真嗣最后的愿望，美里进入了明日香的病房，归还她的安全卡。明日香仍被深度镇静，尽管她的眼睛睁着，但并未显示出她认出美里的迹象。

"Hey Asuka," said Misato as she set the card down on the table next to the bed. Sitting down in the chair which was last sat in by Shinji, she crossed he legs and said, "Shinji's back by the way, just returned a short time ago. He seems to be doing well."  
"嘿，明日香，" 美里说着将卡片放在床边的桌子上。她坐在真嗣上次坐过的椅子上，翘起腿说道，"对了，真嗣回来了，刚回来不久。他看起来状态不错。"

It felt extremely awkward talking by herself in this room which seemed to house only one living person.  
独自在这个似乎只住了一个活人的房间里说话，感觉非常尴尬。

"He's going to go fight the angel with Unit 01 now...just thought you should know..."  
"他现在要去驾驶初号机对抗使徒了...我觉得你应该知道..."

Misato continued looking at the motionless Asuka who's eyes were devoid of there usual blue color and instead were a murky grey. Finally standing up, Misato walked to the door and said, "I'm sure Shinji will come back so...you don't have to worry about him."  
美里继续注视着一动不动的明日香，她的眼睛失去了往常的蓝色，取而代之的是浑浊的灰色。最终站起身来，美里走向门口说道：“我相信真嗣会回来的，所以...你不必为他担心。”

As Misato turned toward the door though, she heard a quiet voice behind her whisper-  
然而，当美里转身向门口走去时，她听到身后传来一个微弱的声音低语——

"Shin...ji?" “真...嗣？”

Misato spun around and was surprised to see Asuka looking at her with a blank expression on her face.  
美里转过身来，惊讶地看到明日香面无表情地看着她。

"Asuka are you okay-" “明日香，你还好吗——”

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Asuka he's-" “明日香，他——”

"Where's Shinji?" she suddenly blurted out. Her eyes were still slightly glazed over, but they had a certain sheen nonetheless.  
"真嗣在哪儿？" 她突然脱口而出。她的眼睛仍然微微有些呆滞，但依然闪烁着某种光芒。

"Asuka he's back and fine, but he's going to be battling the angel, so-"  
"明日香，他回来了，没事，但他要和使徒战斗，所以——"

"Then I'm going too," said Asuka as she suddenly swung her legs over the side of her bed and tried to stand up. Instead she tilted to her left and was in danger of falling over as Misato caught her.  
"那我也要去，" 明日香说着，突然将双腿从床边甩下，试图站起来。结果她向左倾斜，差点摔倒，幸好美里及时扶住了她。

"See Asuka, you're in shape to pilot. You're heavily drugged and can barely stand up. How do you expect to pilot if you can't even do this simple thing."  
"看，明日香，你现在的状态能驾驶 EVA。你被大量药物影响，几乎站都站不稳。如果连这么简单的事都做不到，你又怎么能驾驶 EVA 呢？"

"I don't care I'll mange somehow!"  
"我不在乎，我总会想办法的！"

"Asuka listen to me-" "明日香，听我说——"

"I don't want to be useless!" she suddenly shouted. "I want to help him! Let me help him! I don't want to be extra baggage. I want to pilot! I WANT TO HAVE A PURPOSE!"  
"我不想成为无用之人！" 她突然大喊。"我想帮助他！让我帮助他！我不想成为多余的负担。我想驾驶！我想要有存在的意义！"

It was all Misato could do to refrain from slapping her. Instead she settled on grabbing her shoulders and pushing her roughly back down on the bed.  
Misato 只能尽力克制自己不去扇她。相反，她选择了抓住她的肩膀，粗暴地将她推回到床上。

"Asuka Listen To Me!" she annunciated with each word.  
"明日香，听我说！" 她每个字都清晰地发音。

Asuka continued shaking her head and struggling against Misato's grasp and it was only until Misato grabbed both of Asuka's cheek with one of her hands and pressed them together that she got her to stop.  
明日香继续摇头挣扎，直到美里用一只手抓住她的双颊并紧紧按住，她才停止了动作。

"Asuka...Shinji is fine! You should know that better than anybody. You were the only person that believed in him when nobody else would; I myself didn't until just recently."  
“明日香……真嗣没事的！你应该比任何人都清楚。你是唯一一个在他无人相信时还相信他的人；就连我自己也是最近才真正相信他。”

"I know that but-" “我知道，但是——”

"But what? Is the need to prove you exist stronger than your trust in Shinji?"  
"但什么？证明你存在的需要比你对真嗣的信任更重要吗？"

"I-"

"Asuka...what do you think of Shinji?"  
"明日香...你怎么看真嗣？"

"I-"

"Do you love him?" "你爱他吗？"

"I don't know damn it! I don't know how I feel about that idiot. I-"  
"我他妈的不知道！我不知道我对那个白痴的感觉。我-"

"Asuka...Shinji is fighting, he may be fighting for everybody, but I think deep down he's fighting for you, because he hates to see you pilot the Evangelions. It hurts him to see your entire existence wrapped up in that thing."  
"明日香...真嗣在战斗，他可能是在为所有人战斗，但我认为他内心深处是在为你而战，因为他讨厌看到你驾驶 EVA。看到你的整个存在都被那东西束缚，他感到心痛。"

"It was my decision-" "这是我的决定-"

"But did you have a choice?"  
"但你有选择吗？"

"Of course I did, I could have done anything I wanted."  
"当然有，我可以做任何我想做的事。"

"Do you honestly believe that?"  
"你真的相信这些吗？"

"I-"

"Do you?" "你真的知道吗？"

"...no, I don't." "……不，我没有。"

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"Stop this, I'm feel like I'm being cross examined!"  
"别这样，我感觉像在接受审讯！"

"I think you need it Asuka, you need to come to terms with your superiority complex, because its not only hurting you, its hurting Shinji also. He can never understand what you're honestly thinking, and yet he still trusts you."  
"我认为你需要这样，明日香，你需要正视你的优越情结，因为它不仅在伤害你自己，也在伤害真嗣。他永远无法理解你真实的想法，但他依然信任你。"

"Thats his problem, not mine."  
"那是他的问题，不是我的。"

"Are you truly that selfish Asuka, because I don't think you are? I think that deep down, you're still that little girl who I met on my brief visit to Germany, who didn't want anything but the affection of her parents. They are gone now, and so you latched onto the only person who you felt gave you that same feeling."  
"你真的那么自私吗，明日香？我不这么认为。我觉得你内心深处，还是那个我在德国短暂访问时遇到的，只渴望父母关爱的小女孩。他们现在不在了，所以你紧紧抓住了唯一让你感受到那种感觉的人。"

"Misato...stop it." Asuka was starting to shake and shiver.  
"美里...别说了。" 明日香开始颤抖起来。"

Misato paused for a second before she said, "I suppose I should, I've said enough anyway."  
美里停顿了一下，然后说："我想我应该停下了，反正我也说得够多了。"

As Misato turned to truly leave, she said, "Realize Asuka that this isn't entirely your problem, its also Shinji's. He constantly questions himself and his own existence as to why he exists. Furthermore I'm to blame also, because I neglected my duties as a guardian and left you two to fend for yourselves when there was obviously a problem."  
当美里真正要离开时，她说道：“认识到这一点，明日香，这不完全是你的问题，也是真嗣的。他不断质疑自己和他存在的理由。此外，我也有责任，因为我忽视了作为监护人的职责，在明显有问题的情况下让你们两个自生自灭。”

"Misa-" “美里——”

"Get some rest Asuka...you look like you need it."  
“去休息一下吧，明日香……你看起来很需要。”

"...Hmmm, I suppose you're right."  
"...嗯，我想你是对的。"

As Misato left, she turned the lights off to Asuka's room, and quietly closed the door.  
美里离开时，她关掉了明日香房间的灯，并轻轻地关上了门。

Asuka meanwhile was laying flat on her bed with her eyes open and her hands clasped over her chest. Closing her eyes briefly, she turned to her left so that her back was now facing the door. Opening her eyes again, she bit down on her lips in a pained expression as she thought of what Misato had said.  
与此同时，明日香平躺在床上，眼睛睁着，双手交叠在胸前。她短暂地闭上眼睛，转向左侧，使自己的背部现在面向门。再次睁开眼睛，她咬紧嘴唇，露出痛苦的表情，回想着美里所说的话。

Rolling back to her previous position, she passed into a fitful sleep filled with memories of Shinji and herself.  
她翻回原来的位置，陷入了一段充满与真嗣回忆的浅眠之中。

---

Shinji had to admire the personal of Nerv, even if they had been completely afraid of him until just recently. When he reached the chamber where the Eva's were kept, he found that Unit 01 had already had its entry plug prepared, and was waiting for him to enter it.  
真嗣不得不佩服 NERV 的工作人员，尽管他们直到最近还对他完全心存畏惧。当他到达存放 EVA 的舱室时，发现 01 号机已经准备好了插入栓，正等待着他进入。

Thanking the personal in his heart, he climbed the ladder and dropped down into the entry plug, where it was inserted just below the head of Unit 01.  
他在心中向工作人员表示感谢，爬上梯子，落入插入栓内，插入栓正好位于 01 号机的头部下方。

Settling himself in the entry plug, he inhaled deeply and felt the warmth of the LCL fluid flow through his lungs. He hadn't felt this good in a while honestly.  
他坐进插入栓，深吸一口气，感受着 LCL 液体温暖地流过肺部。老实说，他已经很久没有感觉这么好了。

Just then Ritsuko's voice came over the intercom.  
就在这时，赤木律子的声音通过通讯器传来。

"Shinji...can you here me?"  
“真嗣...你能听到我吗？”

"Perfectly fine," he replied.  
"完全没问题," 他回答道。

"How do you-" "你怎么——"

"Can we save the discrepancy's? I'd be more than happy to let you pick apart my thoughts later but don't I have something more important I have to do?"  
"我们能不能先放下这些分歧？我很乐意稍后让你剖析我的想法，但我现在不是有更重要的事情要做吗？"

Ritsuko pause for a second before she said, "You're right...but before anything else I wanted to say I'm sorry."  
赤木律子顿了一下，然后说道：“你说得对……但在那之前，我想先说声对不起。”

"Its fine," said Shinji without much emotion in his voice. "And? Where is the angel? I assume its already penetrated into the Geofront."  
“没关系，”真嗣语气平淡地说，“然后呢？使徒在哪里？我猜它已经侵入了地底都市。”

"Yes it has. It isn't doing much though besides ripping apart the landscape. We had initially thought that it would descend into Central Dogma, but that doesn't seem to be its intentions."  
“是的，它已经进来了。不过除了破坏地形之外，它并没有什么大动作。我们最初以为它会下降到中央教条区，但看来那并非它的意图。”

"Then what _is_ its intentions?"  
"那么它的意图是什么？"

"The destruction of you and Unit 01 I have believe."  
"我认为是毁灭你和初号机。"

"...Great." "...太好了。"

"Take elevator shaft two. I'll divert the direction so you'll end somewhere close to the angel."  
"走电梯井二号。我会改变方向，让你落到离天使不远的地方。"

"Where is it?" "它在哪儿？"

"Sector three." "三区。"

"Isn't that where the power plant that supplies power to the entirety of Nerv?"  
"那不就是给整个 Nerv 供电的发电厂吗？"

"Well yes...but we have back up reserves if anything should happen."  
"嗯，是的...但如果发生什么情况，我们还有备用储备。"

"...Okay...I'm going." "...好吧...我走了。"

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"...Hmmm?" "...嗯？"

"Don't die..." "别死..."

'Now she tells me,' he thought as he had Unit 01 stand up and forcefully remove the binders holding it in place, though he was still touched by her remark.  
'现在她才告诉我，' 他想，当零一单位站起来并强行移除固定它的束缚器时，尽管如此，她的这句话还是触动了他。

---

As he stepped onto elevator shaft three, he had a moments thought of how his life would have turned out if he had never encountered Asuka or the Eva's, when an all to familiar jerk rocketed his body upwards, as he was sent flying into the Geofront.  
当他踏入三号电梯井时，脑海中闪过一念，若是从未遇见明日香或 EVA，他的人生将会如何。然而，一股熟悉的猛力将他身体向上抛射，他被瞬间送入了地底都市。

Almost as though the angel had been waiting for him, the second that the very ground the angel had been destroying opened up and Unit 01 flew into the open air, it spun around and with an orange flash of light, shot what seemed to be something similar to AT-field, out of its eyes.  
仿佛天使一直在等待着他，就在天使破坏的大地裂开，初号机飞入开阔空气中的那一刻，它旋转身体，伴随着橙色闪光，从眼中射出了类似 AT 力场的某种东西。

Knowing that the combined efforts of his and Unit 01's AT-field wouldn't be nearly strong enough to repel the beam of raw energy, Shinji quickly had Unit 01 pivot in mid air, twisting its entire body around, as the beam went soaring past its right shoulder. Even if he was barely clipped by something like that, Shinji was afraid it might take an entire arm off.  
深知自己与初号机联合的 AT 力场不足以抵挡这股纯粹能量的光束，真嗣迅速让初号机在空中旋转，整个机体扭转，光束擦着右肩呼啸而过。即便只是轻微擦过，真嗣也担心这可能会夺去整条手臂。

Landing on the ground with a loud crash, Unit 01 crouched towards the ground with the toes of its armor plate feet pointed up in the air, poised to dodge if quickly needed.  
以一声巨响着陆后，01 号机蹲伏在地，装甲板脚趾朝天翘起，随时准备闪避。

Shinji weighed his chances on the best option to choose from. He was obviously inferior to the angel before and even with the might of Unit 01, he didn't feel as though he could break through its AT-field.  
真嗣权衡着最佳选择的可能性。他显然不如眼前的天使强大，即便有 01 号机的力量，他也不觉得自己能突破其 AT 力场。

The angel named Zeruel made a sudden movement and caught Shinji of guard as what could only be described as arms that looked more like long strips of cloth suddenly shot outwards toward Unit 01. The first one soared over Unit 01's head, missing it completely, but the other passed Unit 01's defenses and stabbed into the armor plating between the collarbone and shoulder.  
名为 Zeruel 的天使突然一动，让真嗣措手不及，只见那看似长条布料的手臂猛地向 01 号机射出。第一条掠过 01 号机头顶，完全落空，但另一条穿过了 01 号机的防线，刺入了锁骨与肩部之间的装甲板。

Shinji felt a momentary pain hit the right side of his body in reaction to the damage to Unit 01, but at least he was able to recognize the opening. Making Unit 01 grab the cloth like substance with its left hand, he forced its right hand up, and easily brought it down as he projected an AT-field, trying to severe the body part from the angel. Instead, what greeted him was an AT-field so strong that the resounding clash between the two sources of raw energy released a shockwave so strong, that the right hand of Unit 01 was suddenly flayed, as though it had been sent through a meat grinder. Of course this affected Shinji also.  
真嗣感到右侧身体因零号机受损而传来一阵剧痛，但至少他意识到了这个破绽。他操控零号机用左手抓住那块布状物质，同时强迫右手向上抬起，并轻松下压，试图通过展开 AT 力场来切断使徒的肢体。然而，迎接他的是一个强大到极致的 AT 力场，两者原始能量的剧烈碰撞释放出强大的冲击波，零号机的右手瞬间被撕裂，仿佛被送进了绞肉机。当然，这也影响到了真嗣本人。

As the shockwave ceased, the back lash of the two AT-field clashing sent Unit 01 flying backwards, with Shinji screaming in pain.  
当冲击波平息后，两个 AT 力场碰撞的反作用力将零号机向后抛飞，真嗣痛苦地尖叫着。

Inside the entry plug, Shinji right hand looked as though it had suffered a similar fate, though not as severe. At the last second, Shinji managed to send his own AT-field out, negating some of the damage as he wrapped it around Unit 01's destroyed hand. Even so though, Shinji's right hand was a bloody mess. His thumb and index finger were both backwards in odd directions and it looked like each separate piece of bone in those fingers had been bent in a different directions. Half an inch of his pinky finger had been completely shaved off, and now it looked like he had dipped it in a bucket of red paint.  
在插入栓内，真嗣的右手看起来也遭受了类似的命运，尽管程度较轻。在最后一刻，真嗣设法释放了自己的 AT 力场，围绕着零号机被摧毁的手将其包裹起来，从而减轻了一些伤害。即便如此，真嗣的右手依然血肉模糊。他的拇指和食指都以奇怪的方向向后弯曲，看起来每根手指的骨头都被不同方向地扭曲了。他的小指有一半完全被削掉，现在看起来就像他把它浸在了一桶红漆里。

Unit 01 upended dirt and trees as it went flying backwards, before finally skidding to a halt at the edge of the small lake that rested in the Geofront.  
零号机翻滚着泥土和树木向后飞去，最终在小湖边停了下来，这个小湖位于地底都市的边缘。

As Shinji shook his head to rid himself of the pain, he felt something in the back of his mind telling him to move. Using Unit 01's back as a brace, he kicked its legs up, pushing the entire body up as he went. He did this just in time as those white arm liked things came soaring toward him. Ducking under the first one, he side stepped to the right, as he managed to dodge both of them.  
当真嗣摇摇头试图摆脱疼痛时，他感觉到脑海深处有个声音告诉他要移动。他利用零号机的背部作为支撑，踢起双腿，推动整个身体向上。就在那些白色手臂状的东西向他飞来时，他及时地做了这个动作。他低头躲过了第一个，然后向右闪避，成功地躲过了两个。

Running along the shore of the lake Shinji continued dodging the arms of the angel while he desperately tried to think of a plan, but no such wisdom would come to him. Would the Eva rifles work, or did they need heavier weapons than that? Furthermore, could any conventional type weapons even damage the angel?  
沿着湖岸奔跑，真嗣继续躲避着天使的手臂，同时拼命试图想出一个计划，但智慧并未降临。EVA 步枪会有效吗，还是他们需要比这更重的武器？此外，任何常规武器能对天使造成伤害吗？

Forgetting about the situation he was in, he misplaced his footing, and Unit 01 sunk slightly into the soft sand along the shore of the river. If any indication of the angels not being intelligent beings existed before, well, they were all just proven wrong. The angel, taking advantage of Shinji's sudden predicament turned towards him, and with another flash of orange, fired off its beam like AT-field.  
他忘记了所处的情境，失足踏错，初号机稍微陷入了河岸的柔软沙地中。如果之前有任何迹象表明天使不是智能生物，那么现在都被证明是错误的。天使趁真嗣突然陷入困境之际转向他，伴随着橙光一闪，发射出其光束般的 AT 力场。

Realizing that dodging the full brunt of the damage would be near impossible, Shinji shifted Unit 01's body so that its damaged arm would take the majority of the damage. He didn't even think what would happen to himself.  
意识到躲避全部伤害几乎是不可能的，真嗣调整了初号机的身体，让受损的手臂承受大部分伤害。他甚至没考虑自己会怎样。

As the raw beam of energy neared him, he concentrated both his and Unit 01 AT-field around the upper shoulder of its right arm. He was prepared to sacrifice one arm if he absolutely had to, but some part of his mind realized what would happened to his own body, and decide that everything below the elbow was expendable.  
当那股原始能量束逼近时，他集中了自己和初号机的 AT 力场于右臂上肩部位。他已做好牺牲一条手臂的准备，但内心某处意识到这将对自身造成何种影响，于是决定手腕以下的部分皆可舍弃。

The AT-field of the angel completely ripped through the armor and flesh of Unit 01, all but disintegrated it on impact. Thankfully, the combined efforts of Shinji and Unit 01 were able to protect the upper part of the shoulder. White bone now stuck out where the right arm of Unit 01 used to be and gray pinkish flesh could be seen hanging down around the bone.  
使徒的 AT 力场彻底撕裂了初号机的装甲与血肉，几乎在撞击瞬间将其化为乌有。幸运的是，真嗣与初号机的合力保护了肩部以上。如今，初号机右臂处白骨森然，灰粉色的肌肉组织垂挂其旁。

Amazingly enough, Shinji hadn't felt a thing during it all. His right arm was simply gone. Quite possibly though, the moment that his arm was completely destroyed, his body went into cardiac arrest. His minutes of consciousness were already starting to tick away. Willing himself to not look over at the stub that was sure to be what remained of his arm, he through caution to the winds and charged towards the angel.  
令人惊异的是，整个过程中真嗣竟毫无痛感，他的右臂就这样消失了。或许在手臂被完全摧毁的那一刻，他的心脏便已停止跳动。意识的时间正一分一秒流逝。他强迫自己不去看那残肢断臂，抛开一切顾虑，向使徒冲去。

More of the cloth like arms soared towards him, but Shinji dodged them quite easily. As he reached towards the angel, he drew Unit 01 left arm back, and threw it forward, generating both his and Unit 01's AT-field in the process in the hope that the combined effort would be enough to force his way through the angels defensive. He had not expected this to happen though.  
更多的布状手臂向他袭来，但真嗣轻松地躲开了。当他向使徒伸出手时，他将初号机的左臂向后拉，然后猛地向前一挥，同时生成了自己和初号机的 AT 力场，希望这种合力能够突破使徒的防御。但他没想到会发生这种情况。

Suddenly the angels AT-field expanded into several layered AT-fields, all reinforcing each other. Unit 01's fist crashed down on top of the AT-fields, creating a gong like noise as it collided with it. The first two layers were immediately shattered, but Unit 01's fist was stopped against the third layer. As Unit 01's fist was halted against the combined AT-fields, the angels whitish arms suddenly lashed outwards, stabbing into what would have been consider the right lung of Unit 01, and this time Shinji was affected.  
突然间，使徒的 AT 力场扩展成多层叠加的力场，相互增强。初号机的拳头猛击在这些力场上，碰撞时发出类似锣声的巨响。前两层力场立刻被击碎，但初号机的拳头被第三层力场挡住了。当初号机的拳头被这些合力场阻挡时，使徒的白色手臂突然向外刺出，刺入了初号机右肺的位置，这一次真嗣受到了影响。

Blood immediately spilled from his mouth as his right lung all but caved in upon himself, spilling forth bloody watery fluid into his chest cavity. At this point his vision was starting to get blurry, when Unit 01 suddenly ceased functioning.  
鲜血立刻从他的口中涌出，右肺几乎完全塌陷，胸腔内充满了血水。此时他的视线开始变得模糊，初号机突然停止了运作。

Completely confused at what had happened, Shinji thought that that last attack had done something to affect his control over the Eva when he realized that his five minutes were up.  
完全搞不清楚发生了什么，真嗣以为刚才的攻击影响了他对 Eva 的控制，直到他意识到自己的五分钟时间已经到了。

"Damn it! No, that can't be!" he swore.  
“该死！不，不可能！”他咒骂道。

Grabbing the controls of Unit 01, he willfully shook them back and forth as he repeated over and over. "Move damn it, move damn it, move damn it." Of course nothing happened.  
他抓住 01 号机体的控制器，任性地来回摇晃，一遍遍重复着：“动啊，该死的，动啊，该死的，动啊。”当然，什么也没发生。

As Shinji continued to wrestle with Unit 01, the angel floated motionless, a few inches out the ground for a few seconds. It almost seemed to be contemplating its next move.  
当真嗣继续与初号机搏斗时，使徒悬浮在空中，离地面仅几英寸，静止了几秒钟。它似乎在思考下一步的行动。

Drawing its arms back suddenly, the angel folded them into what looked like two large cylinders, before it shot them forward, smashing it against the chest cavity of Unit 01. The impact sent the motionless Unit 01 reeling backwards and made more blood spill forth out of Shinji's mouth.  
使徒突然将双臂向后一缩，折叠成两个巨大的圆柱体，随即猛地向前射出，重重地撞击在初号机的胸腔上。这一击让原本静止不动的初号机向后踉跄，更多的鲜血从真嗣的口中涌出。

The angel then floated over to the humanoid, now lying on the ground and proceeded to repeatedly pound against the chest cavity of Unit 01, as though it was looking for something. Eventually it seemed to realize that it had to take apart the armor plating on front and changed it arms to the thin pieces of cloth again. Stabbing them forward, the left arm pierced what would be consider the stomach of Unit 01 and forced its arms underneath the armor plating, while the right arm did likewise on the armor plating that would have been protecting the heart. All at once the arms lifted up, and with an almighty wrench, pulled off the armor plating around the chest cavity.  
接着，使徒飘向倒在地上的初号机，开始反复猛击其胸腔，仿佛在寻找什么。最终，它似乎意识到必须拆开前方的装甲板，于是又将双臂变回细布条状。左臂刺入初号机腹部，迫使其手臂伸入装甲板下方，右臂则在保护心脏的装甲板上如法炮制。双臂同时发力，伴随着巨大的扭力，将胸腔周围的装甲板一举撕下。

Laying underneath all that armor was what could very well be considered its heart. A large spherical red orb was dead center in its chest and it looked liked the flesh around it had adapted to its presence. Large veins and smalls flabs of skin were intertwining and crisscrossing as they went over the core of Unit 01.  
在那层层装甲之下，隐藏着可以被视为其心脏的东西。一个巨大的红色球体正中央位于其胸口，周围的肉体似乎已经适应了它的存在。粗大的血管和小块的皮肤交织在一起，纵横交错地覆盖在 01 号机体的核心上。

It was at this time that Misato entered the command center.  
就在这时，美里进入了指挥中心。

"Whats the situation Ritsuko?" she asked the moment she entered the command center. "Whats Shinji doing? Is he all right?"  
“情况怎么样，律子？”她一进入指挥中心就问道，“真嗣在做什么？他没事吧？”

"Pilot life signs dropping," came the voice of one of the computer personal, "pulse dropping, loss of blood reaching critical levels, respiratory systems malfunctioning."  
"驾驶员生命迹象下降，" 一位电脑操作员的声音传来，"脉搏减弱，失血达到危险水平，呼吸系统功能失常。"

"Send an electric discharge through his body if you have to by using the Eva's nervous system."  
"如果必要的话，通过 Eva 的神经系统向他的身体发送电击。"

"...I'm sorry Doctor Akagi, we can't do that since the Eva has shut down."  
"...很抱歉，赤木博士，我们无法这样做，因为 Eva 已经关闭了。"

"Well do something!" shouted Misato as she let her presence be known.  
“快做点什么！”美里大声喊道，让她的存在感显露无遗。

"Misato...when did you-" asked Ritsuko, but she was quickly cut off by Misato.  
“美里……你什么时候——” 律子问道，但很快被美里打断了。

"What is going on! What happened with Shinji!"  
“到底发生了什么！真嗣怎么了！”

"Misato...Shinji is in critical condition...he has several broken ribs, a destroyed lung, and his...right arm...is gone."  
"美里...真嗣情况危急...他有多根肋骨断裂，肺部严重受损，而且他的...右臂...没了。"

"Gone what do you mean-"  
"没了？你是什么意思-"

"You know how strong Shinji and Unit 01's sync ratio is...the angel destroyed Unit 01's right arm, and in doing so, also destroyed Shinji's right arm. Shinji's heart has already gone into cardiac arrest...he only has minutes to live."  
"你知道真嗣和初号机的同步率有多高...使徒摧毁了初号机的右臂，也因此摧毁了真嗣的右臂。真嗣的心脏已经停止跳动...他只剩下几分钟的生命了。"

"Then get him out of there! Get him-"  
"那就把他弄出来！快把他——"

"Misato...the commander just ordered a N-2 bomb dropped onto the angels location. Its not expected to destroy the angel...only slow it down."  
"美里...指挥官刚刚下令向使徒的位置投放 N-2 炸弹。预计不会摧毁使徒...只是为了减缓它的行动。"

"What about Shinji?" "那真嗣怎么办？"

"...The bomb will most likely kill him if he isn't dead already. Without the life support systems he wont be able to survive the impact."  
"...如果他还没死的话，炸弹很可能会杀了他。没有了生命维持系统，他无法承受撞击。"

"And what about Unit 01?" asked Misato, cold fury flickering through her eyes.  
"那零号机呢？" 美里问道，眼中闪过一丝冰冷的怒火。"

"Its expected to survive, though it'll be heavily damaged."  
"预计它能存活下来，尽管会严重受损。"

"AND I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST SIT BACK AND LET THIS HAPPEN?" yelled Misato, her anger finally getting the better of her.  
"难道我就该坐视不管，任由这一切发生吗？" 美里大喊道，她的愤怒终于压倒了一切。

"What else can we do!" Ritsuko yelled back at her. It was then that Misato realized how hard this was for Ritsuko also.  
"我们还能做什么！" 律子朝她吼了回去。这时，美里才意识到这对律子来说也同样艰难。

"...I...don't know," said Misato as the full weight of everything crashed into her. And honestly...what could they do?  
"...我...不知道，" 美里说着，所有事情的沉重压力一下子涌上心头。老实说...他们又能做些什么呢？

It was dark, but not complete darkness. It was like the kind that you get when you close your eyes, and yet you're still able to see a faint outline of the room as it was before you closed your eyes.  
四周昏暗，却非全然的黑暗。那种感觉就像你闭上眼睛时，仍能隐约看到房间在你闭眼前的大致轮廓。

Shinji tentatively opened his eyes, but his vision was little better with his eyes opened. His eyes had almost completely fogged over and turned a light gray color. Small droplets of blood were dripping down the side of his face, as they leaked out of his mouth.  
真嗣试探性地睁开眼睛，但视野并未因睁眼而有所改善。他的双眼几乎完全蒙上了一层薄雾，变成了浅灰色。小滴的血液从他脸颊一侧滴落，它们是从他嘴里渗出的。

'Oh right,' he suddenly thought, 'I was fighting that angel and...I think I'm dying.'  
"“哦，对了，”他突然想到，“我在和那个使徒战斗，而且……我想我快要死了。”

Oddly enough, that thought didn't scare him in the slightest. Maybe it had something to do with the fact he never cared whether he lived or not, since his life was all but worthless. A part of him even welcomed death; anything to do away with this empty feeling.  
说来也怪，这个念头丝毫没有让他感到害怕。或许是因为他从未在意过自己是否活着，毕竟他的生命几乎毫无价值。他甚至有一部分渴望死亡；任何能摆脱这种空虚感的事情。

As he closed his eyes again he thought, 'Oh right...my promise to Asuka. Heh, guess I won't be able keep it...'  
当他再次闭上眼睛时，他想道：'哦对了...我对明日香的承诺。呵，看来我是无法遵守了...'

The majority of Shinji's mind started to drift then, but a part of him felt as though he was forgetting something.  
真嗣的大部分意识开始飘散，但有一部分感觉自己似乎忘记了什么。

'But no...this doesn't feel right for some reason.'  
'但不知为何...这样感觉不对劲。'

'Why bother worrying? Give up like you always do.'  
'何必担心呢？像往常一样放弃不就好了。'

'Thats not who I am anymore.'  
'那已不再是我的模样。'

'Sure you are, you're giving up right now aren't you?'  
'当然相信你，你现在不正是在放弃吗？'

'No I'll live.' '不，我会活下去的。'

'How do you propose you do that when your body's completely failing you?'  
'你的身体已经完全崩溃了，你打算怎么做到这一点？'

'I'll find a way.' '我会找到办法的。'

'How though?' '可怎么找呢？'

'I don't know.' '我不知道。'

'See, you don't know, so why don't you give up already?'  
'看吧，你不知道，所以为什么不干脆放弃呢？'

'But I need to help the others, they need me.'  
'但我需要帮助其他人，他们需要我。'

'Why? They shunned you and kicked you to the curb. Why should we bother saving them?'  
'为什么？他们排斥你，把你踢到一边。我们为什么要费心救他们？'

'Because they're important to me.'  
'因为对我来说他们很重要。'

'How important? Important enough to wager your life?'  
'有多重要？重要到可以赌上你的性命吗？'

'...Yes, they're my friends and family. I don't want to lose what I've finally found.'  
'……是的，他们是我的朋友和家人。我不想失去我终于找到的东西。'

'And what have you found?'  
'那你找到了什么？'

'...Love...' '...爱...'

An electrical surge suddenly hit Shinji as his heart was just about to reach its final beat. His eyes flew open and they were as red as the setting sun. The controls in front of him disappeared along with the seat in the entry plug, and he suddenly found himself in a never ending sea of LCL fluid. The blood stopped flowing from his mouth as the hole where his right lung once was, now had a layer of skin stretched over it. Breathing was still rather difficult, and his breaths came in long drawn out gasps, but they were still his breaths.  
一道电流突然击中了真嗣，就在他的心脏即将完成最后一次跳动之际。他的双眼猛地睁开，红得如同落日余晖。面前的控制台连同插入栓内的座椅一同消失，他发现自己置身于一片无边无际的 LCL 液体之中。从他口中流出的血液停止了，原本右肺所在之处现在覆盖了一层皮肤。呼吸依旧困难，他的呼吸变得漫长而费力，但那依然是他的呼吸。

Eva reactivated. EVA 重新启动了。

Meanwhile Misato and Ritsuko could not believe there eyes as they saw Unit 01 slowly climb to its feet.  
与此同时，美里和律子简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，他们看到初号机缓缓地站了起来。

"I don't believe this," said one of the female operatives in the command center. The pilots sync rate is over four hundred percent, while the plug depth is well past the danger zone and climbing past the two hundred mark.  
“我简直不敢相信，”指挥中心的一名女操作员说道，“驾驶员的同步率超过了四百个百分点，而插入栓的深度已经远远超过了危险区域，并且还在向两百的标记攀升。”

"Has Unit 01 reactivated itself?"  
“初号机自己重新启动了吗？”

"Yes it has...and it seems that Unit 01 jump started the pilots heart with its own nerves. Furthermore a large influx of dopamine is being constantly produced by the pilots brain."  
“是的，已经……而且似乎是 01 号机用自己的神经激活了驾驶员的心脏。此外，驾驶员的大脑正在持续产生大量多巴胺。”

As Ritsuko turned back to the monitor she exclaimed, "Has Yui finally awakened...or is it because of Shinji?"  
当律子转回监视器时，她惊呼道：“是唯终于苏醒了……还是因为真嗣？”

Misato was none the wiser.  
美里对此一无所知。

As Shinji floated there in the LCL fluid, he was able to feel the slight changes in movement of the angel. He even though he recognized something similar to a thought process, but now wasn't the time for that. He didn't know how long he would be able to maintain this...he _had_ lost a lot of blood.  
在 LCL 液中漂浮的碇真嗣，能感受到使徒微小的动作变化。他甚至觉得他察觉到了某种类似思考的过程，但此刻并非深究之时。他不知道自己还能坚持多久...他已经失血过多。

Making Unit 01 walk forward, the bracers holding the mouth closed suddenly snapped off, and Unit 01 let out a ferocious roar as it charged towards the angel, as though it had a will of itself. The angel quickly deployed it arms, shooting them out towards Unit 01, though Unit 01 was easily able to dodge around them as it made its way to the angel.  
使徒 01 迈步前行，固定其嘴部的护臂突然断裂，使徒 01 发出一声凶猛的咆哮，仿佛拥有自己的意志般冲向使徒。使徒迅速伸出双臂，向使徒 01 射击，但使徒 01 轻松地躲闪着，向使徒逼近。

Suddenly pulling its left fist back, it shot forward towards the angel and the two AT-fields clashed against each other. The ground beneath the two was pulled up into the air and flung across the Geofront as the two AT-fields came into contact. Large waves started to form in the lake, as the shear wind power generated between the two was equal to a category five hurricane.  
突然间，它将左拳向后一拉，猛地向前击向使徒，两者的 AT 力场相互碰撞。两者脚下的地面被掀起，随着 AT 力场的接触，被抛向 Geofront 各处。湖中开始形成巨大的波浪，两者之间产生的风力强度堪比五级飓风。

Finally, the angel broke off its AT-field, and fired its arms towards Unit 01. This time, instead of dodging them, Unit 01 calming placed its left palm out wards, and generated an AT-field that completely sliced the arms into, spilling blood across the ground. If the angel had a voice, it would have surely been screaming.  
最终，天使解除了它的 AT 力场，将双臂射向初号机。这一次，初号机没有躲避，而是平静地伸出左掌，生成一个 AT 力场，将双臂完全切断，鲜血洒满地面。如果天使有声音，它肯定会尖叫不已。

Bending down, Unit 01 grabbed a piece of the flesh that it had ripped off and held it up to what remained of its right arm. What happened next could only be considered as high speed regeneration. The bit of flesh that remained on the right arm of Unit 01 suddenly stretched downwards and latched itself onto the large piece of flesh. A large bulge suddenly appeared in the piece of flesh where an elbow would be, and then the piece of flesh expanded as the cells sped up the growth. Fingers popped outwards until what could only be described as a human hand remained.  
初号机弯下腰，抓起自己撕下的肉块，举到残存的右臂旁。接下来发生的事情只能被视为高速再生。初号机右臂上残留的肉块突然向下延伸，附着在较大的肉块上。肉块上本该是肘部的地方突然鼓起一个大包，随后肉块随着细胞加速生长而膨胀。手指向外伸出，直到只剩下一只人类的手。

It seemed that this worked both ways.  
看来这是双向的。

Shinji stared in amazement at his regrown right arm, which until moments ago had been nothing but a bloody stub. Turning it around, he inspected all aspects of it. Everything seemed the same, he wasn't even able to tell whether he had lost his arm or not.  
真嗣惊愕地盯着自己重新长出的右臂，就在片刻之前，它还只是一截血淋淋的残肢。他转动着手臂，仔细检查每一个细节。一切都似乎与原来无异，他甚至无法判断自己是否真的失去过手臂。

Without giving Shinji any more time to examine his regrown arm, Unit 01 charged forward again, its right arm extended this time, and brought it spiraling down through the air. Almost as though it sliced through the air, a sickle AT-field suddenly shot towards the angel. The angel attempted to put up its AT-fields, but it was late as the AT-field sliced its chest cavity open, revealing its own core.  
不给真嗣更多时间检查他新生的手臂，初号机再次冲锋向前，这次伸出的是右臂，它在空中旋转着猛扑而下。仿佛划破空气一般，一道镰刀状的 AT 力场突然射向使徒。使徒试图展开自己的 AT 力场，但为时已晚，AT 力场切开了它的胸腔，露出了内部的核心。

Attempting to quickly remedy the problem, the angel fired off its beam like AT-field. Unit 01 placed both palms outwards and generated a dome liked AT-field around itself, send the beam curving off into a nearby hillside, which next second turned into a cloud of dust.  
试图迅速解决问题，使徒发射出类似光束的 AT 力场。初号机双掌向外，生成一个穹顶状的 AT 力场环绕自身，将光束偏转向附近的山坡，下一秒那里便化作一片尘埃。

Before the angel was able to follow up on its attack, Unit 01 took the initiative and charged towards it. Kicking outwards, its right foot connected with the core of the angel, and Unit 01 forced it spiraling backwards. Pinning the angel to the ground, it repeatedly hammered away at the core before it realized that what it was doing was pointless. With eyes narrowed to slits, it brought its right fist back, smashed it against what was considered to be the skull of the angel. Brain matter exploded out the back of the head as the ground was sprayed with blood.  
在天使能够继续攻击之前，初号机主动出击，向其冲去。右脚向外踢出，正中天使的核心，初号机迫使其螺旋后退。将天使按在地上，它反复锤击核心，直到意识到这一切都是徒劳。双眼眯成一条缝，它将右拳收回，猛击天使被视为头骨的部位。脑浆从后脑喷涌而出，鲜血溅洒在地面上。

Unit 01 then proceeded to rip apart the rest of the angel as it searched for a certain device, but Shinji couldn't remember the rest of this...as his blood loss finally caught up with him.  
随后，初号机开始撕裂天使的其余部分，同时寻找某个特定装置，但真嗣已经记不清接下来的事情了……因为失血过多，他终于支撑不住了。

"Do you really think this is smart?" asked Ritsuko  
“你真的认为这样做明智吗？”律子问道

"I'm there guardian...and I trust them."  
"我是他们的监护人...而且我相信他们。"

"Yes but...they're still teenagers. What if it ends up like you and Kaji?"  
"是的，但是...他们毕竟还是青少年。万一结果像你和加持那样怎么办？"

"I'm hope to God they have more common sense they we did," replied Misato. "I've already said I trust the both of them."  
"我祈祷他们比我们更有常识，"美里回答道。"我已经说过我相信他们两个。"

"Emotions run high in these types of situations..."  
"在这种情境下，情绪总是高涨……"

"While true those two aren't like that."  
"虽然那两人确实不是那样。"

"Doesn't mean they wont in the future."  
"但这并不意味着他们未来不会。"

Misato was silent for a second before she said, "No it doesn't...but this is now. Asuka and Shinji wont make that mistake. Or are you worried about the possibility of Shinji being able to pass on the gene?"  
美里沉默了一会儿，然后说道：“不，不是那样……但这是现在。明日香和真嗣不会再犯那个错误。还是说，你担心真嗣有可能传递这个基因？”

"Yes theres that also, I suppose. But-"  
“是的，我想也有这个因素。但是——”

"You weren't thinking about that," said Misato, finishing Ritsuko's sentence for her.  
“你并不是在考虑那个，”美里替律子完成了句子。

"No...I wasn't." "不...我没有。"

"Then what were you thinking?" asked Misato with a raised eyebrow.  
"那你当时在想什么？" 美里挑了挑眉毛问道。

"Never mind, its unimportant. I suppose we the most we can do is give them some peace and quiet."  
"算了，这不重要。我想我们能做的最多就是给他们一些安宁。"

"What do you think about Shinji's...arm?"  
"你觉得真嗣的...手臂怎么样？"

"I can't say whether it was because of his connection with Unit 01, or if he has an ability such as that. Maybe he does, and his connection with Unit 01 simply sped up the process, I don't know. I'll be looking for cell tissue though in case his right lung starts to regrow. Until then, he'll be on a respirator unit for a while I suppose."  
"我无法确定这是因为他与初号机的联系，还是他本身就有这种能力。也许他确实有，而与初号机的联系只是加速了这个过程，我不清楚。不过，我会留意细胞组织，以防他的右肺开始再生。在那之前，我想他得依靠呼吸机一段时间了。"

"Ritsuko, I have to say I-"  
"律子，我不得不说我-"

"Don't worry about it Misato, its fine, and I know you're sorry."  
"别担心，美里，没事的，我知道你很抱歉。"

Misato stood motionless in the hallway for a second as Ritsuko continued walking on. Turning around, she looked behind herself and could just barely see the room where Shinji was being kept in and where Asuka were currently staying.  
美里在走廊里一动不动地站了一会儿，而律子继续往前走。她转过身，回头望去，只能隐约看到真嗣被安置的房间，以及目前阿斯卡也在那里。

---

There really wasn't much to say she supposed, and in hind sight, it was rather pointless even being here, since Shinji was completely out of it. Even so, Asuka felt like it was partially her duty to be here by his side. He had promised that he would come back and here he was, battered and bruised but still alive. She supposed she couldn't be any more grateful.  
她想，确实没什么可说的，事后看来，甚至来这里都显得有些多余，因为真嗣完全失去了意识。即便如此，阿斯卡觉得她有部分责任要陪在他身边。他曾承诺会回来，而现在他遍体鳞伤，但依然活着。她想，自己无法再感激更多了。

Resting her elbows on her knees, she sat in one of those chairs that has the plastic back that constantly bothers your back. If she had known things were going to be like this, she would have asked for a more comfortable chair. For some reason that thought made her smile slightly, and she had to suppress a giggle. Seriously what was wrong with her? Well now that was a rather stupid question.  
她将肘部支在膝盖上，坐在一把椅子上，那椅子的塑料靠背总是让人感到不适。如果早知道情况会是这样，她本该要求一把更舒适的椅子。不知为何，这个念头让她微微一笑，甚至差点笑出声来。她不禁自问，自己到底是怎么了？这真是个相当愚蠢的问题。

Shinji was here after all, and currently she felt as though she was floating on a cloud.  
毕竟，真嗣就在这里，而此刻她感觉自己仿佛飘在云端。

Letting out a low sigh she glanced at his sleeping face and thought, 'I guess he's all right when he sleeps. If he just doesn't talk I suppose I could live with him.' Again she seemed to lapse into a fit of giggles  
她轻轻叹了口气，瞥了一眼他熟睡的脸庞，心想：'他睡着时看起来还不错。只要他不开口，我想我还能忍受他。' 她似乎又陷入了一阵轻笑之中。

'His face is even somewhat...'  
"'他的脸甚至还有些...'”

Asuka made a sudden frown as though something nasty had just slithered down her throat.  
明日香突然皱起眉头，仿佛有什么讨厌的东西刚刚滑过她的喉咙。

'God...why am I acting like a stupid lovestruck girl? Idiot...why does he always make me feel this way?'  
'天啊...为什么我表现得像个愚蠢的恋爱中的女孩？白痴...为什么他总是让我有这种感觉？'

Tilting her head slightly to the left, so she could get a better look at his face she thought, 'I'm going to give him hell when he wakes up.'  
她微微向左偏头，以便更清楚地看到他的脸，心想：‘等他醒来，我可要好好教训他一顿。’

Smiling again, she reposition herself in the uncomfortable chair and attempted to go to sleep.  
她再次微笑，重新调整自己在那张不舒服的椅子上的姿势，试图入睡。

'Easier said the done...I guess,' she thought.  
‘说起来容易做起来难...我猜，’她想。

Straightening back up she looked down at Shinji laying in the bed and thought, 'I wonder what...no...definitely not. Impossible. How could I even...'  
她挺直身子，低头看着躺在床上的真嗣，心想：‘我在想什么...不...绝对不可能。怎么可能...’

A light tinge of pink suddenly appeared on Asuka's cheeks as she thought what the difference between sleeping in a chair and a bed felt like.  
想到睡在椅子和床上的区别，明日香的脸颊突然泛起一抹淡淡的红晕。

Eyebrow twitching slightly from irritation, she decided to blame the whole thing on Shinji. (who wasn't even conscious)  
因烦躁而微微抽动的眉毛，她决定把这一切都归咎于真嗣。（尽管他甚至没有意识）

'God this is so infuriating. Why can't I just...'  
'天哪，这太让人恼火了。为什么我就是不能...'

Looking back down at the bed, her eyes shifted from the bed to Shinji before finally settling on the corner of the bed farthest from Shinji.  
她再次低头看向床铺，目光从床移到真嗣身上，最后停留在离真嗣最远的床角。

'Am I really going to?'  
'我真的要这么做吗？'

'Why not?' said a small voice in her mind.  
'为什么不呢？'她脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'Its disgusting...thats why.'  
'这太恶心了……这就是原因。'

'Yeah you're right,' replied the voice as though that settled the matter.  
'是啊，你说得对，'那个声音回答，仿佛这件事就这样解决了。

'Right thats that then,' thought Asuka before she curled up in a ball and attempted to go to sleep.  
'好了，就这样吧，' 明日香想着，然后蜷缩成一团，试图入睡。

"Fuyutsuki?" "冬月？"

"Yes Gendo?" "什么事，碇？"

"It is time to reveal the Lance of Longinus. Have Rei take care of it. I want no word of this to anybody besides us. Now that Unit 01 has awakened and devoured the S-2 engine it is time we proceed to the next step."  
"是时候揭示朗基努斯之枪了。让零来处理它。除了我们，我不想让任何人知道这件事。现在初号机已经觉醒并吞噬了 S-2 引擎，是时候进行下一步了。"

"What about Seele." "那 Seele 那边怎么办？"

"I'll keep the old geezers occupied for now. And while your at it, I want you to have Doctor Akagi get a sample of the pilot of Unit 01's DNA."  
"我会暂时拖住那些老家伙。同时，我要你让赤木博士获取初号机驾驶员的 DNA 样本。"

"Very well...Gendo..." "很好...源堂..."

As Fuyusuki left Gendo's office, Gendo turned to the window behind his desk and said, "Wait for me, Yui."  
当冬月离开源堂的办公室时，源堂转向他办公桌后的窗户，说道：“等我，唯。”

---

Its a good thing that no security cameras were installed in the room that Shinji was occupying, because then they would have noticed as somebody crawled into his bed in the dead of night.  
幸好真嗣所在的房间没有安装监控摄像头，否则他们就会注意到在深夜有人悄悄爬上了他的床。

### Chapter 18: Small Steps  
第 18 章：小步前行  

**...So I don't have internet where I live right now, so updates might come a little less often, just a heads up. Anyway while writing this chapter (which I absolutely love and hope you do to) I realized that it has been over a year since I started this story (actually it was last month but I forgot) I've no idea where the time went but I'd just like to give a big thanks to everybody that has ever reviewed or read this story, whether you've stuck with it since the beginning, or are just jumping on it. Thanks a bunch!  
...所以我现在住的地方没有网络，更新可能会稍微少一些，先打个招呼。话说回来，在写这一章（我非常喜欢，希望你们也喜欢）的时候，我意识到从我开始写这个故事已经过去一年多了（实际上是上个月，但我忘了）。时间都去哪儿了？我只想对所有曾经评论或阅读过这个故事的人表示衷心的感谢，无论是从一开始就陪伴着它，还是刚刚加入。非常感谢！**

---

Shinji's felt as though his whole body had pins and needles drilled through it when he woke up the day after his battle with the angel.  
当真嗣在对抗使徒的战斗后醒来时，他感觉整个身体仿佛被针扎了一样。

He was in a room that was devoid of a window, and therefore pitch black without the lights on. As he tentatively opened his eyes, he winced slightly at the pain that hit him, though he wasn't really surprised as he recalled yesterdays events. He supposed that he was lucky to be alive.  
他身处一个没有窗户的房间，因此不开灯就是漆黑一片。当他小心翼翼地睁开眼睛时，微微皱眉，因为疼痛袭来，但他并不感到意外，毕竟他记得昨天发生的事情。他想，能活着已经算是幸运了。

Laying with his hands resting at his side, he shifted to his right slightly and paused momentarily as he felt the left side of his body brush up against something. His mind suddenly ceased all other functions as he tried to determine who or what was laying next to him. He sincerely hoped that his mind was playing tricks on him, but had to come to terms with the situation when he heard the soft breathing of somebody sleeping next to him.  
他双手放在身侧躺着，微微向右挪动了一下，感觉到左侧身体触碰到了什么东西，便暂时停了下来。他的思绪突然间停止了其他所有功能，试图确定躺在他旁边的是谁或是什么。他真诚地希望这只是自己的幻觉，但当他听到身旁某人轻柔的呼吸声时，不得不接受这个现实。

Shinji's body suddenly became as ridged as a statue at this sudden realization. Turning his head slightly to his left, he was able to discern the small lump of a person next to him, even in the dark.  
意识到这一点，真嗣的身体突然变得像雕像一样僵硬。他微微向左转头，即使在黑暗中也能辨认出身旁那个小隆起的人形。

'...'

His mind drew a complete blank now. He supposed he could get up and search for the light in the dark, but quite possibly he would end up tripping over something and waking the person up. Even so though, he didn't feel comfortable laying there anymore, so with great care, he swung his legs over the side of his bed and immediately had to hold in a string of swear words as his feet hit a plastic chair and knocked it over.  
此刻他的脑海一片空白。他想自己可以起身在黑暗中寻找灯光，但很可能会绊倒什么东西，把那人吵醒。尽管如此，他也不再觉得躺在那里舒服了，于是小心翼翼地，他将双腿移到床边，脚一落地就踩到了一把塑料椅子，椅子倒下时他不得不忍住一连串的咒骂。

'Why the hell would there be something like this here?' he wondered.  
“这里怎么会有这种东西？”他疑惑不解。

Carefully placing one foot down on the hard marmoleum floor, he determined that the chair had been knocked a good distance, and brought his other foot down on the cold floor. Pushing himself off the bed, he winced as he drew in a sharp intake of breath, which felt very painful for some reason.  
他小心翼翼地将一只脚踏在坚硬的大理石地板上，确定椅子被撞出了相当远的距离，然后将另一只脚也放在冰冷的地板上。他推开床，倒抽一口冷气，不知为何这感觉异常疼痛。

'Thats right, I should have only one lung,' he reminded himself.  
“对了，我应该只剩一个肺了，”他提醒自己。

Slowly shuffling towards what he figured was the door, he thought that his best bet was to find somebody that could help him with his...problem, as he thought of it. Though as he reached the door and grasped the door knob to turn it, he realized that it had been locked. Swearing quietly, he searched for the latch that would grant him freedom, when he heard soft mumbling behind him.  
他缓缓地向他认为的门口挪去，心想最好能找到个人帮他解决他的...问题，他这么想着。然而当他走到门前握住门把手准备转动时，却发现门已经被锁上了。他轻声咒骂着，寻找着能让他获得自由的门闩，这时他听到了身后轻微的咕哝声。

Spinning around, he squinted towards the shape that was now tossing and turning in the bed that he had recently vacated. Unsure of how he should proceed, he stood motionless in front of the door watching as the nameless person tossed and turned. Something about the simple motion seemed to jog a memory in Shinji's mind, but he couldn't completely pull it to the forefront.  
他猛地转过身，眯起眼睛看向那个在他刚离开的床上翻来覆去的身影。不确定该如何是好，他一动不动地站在门前，注视着那个无名之人辗转反侧。这个简单的动作似乎触动了真嗣的记忆，但他无法完全将其拉到意识的前沿。

Hesitating slightly, he finally started tiptoeing back to the edge of his bed as his curiosity got the better of him. Who _exactly_ was in the bed that he had been in moments before. Realization hit him none to gently as he reached out a hand to prod against what he assumed was the persons back, only to freeze inches away as he heard a very distinguishable word, coupled with a faint flowery smell. The word uttered was his name of course.  
他稍稍犹豫了一下，最终还是被好奇心驱使，踮起脚尖走回床边。究竟是谁躺在他刚刚离开的床上？当他伸出手去触碰他认为是那人背部的位置时，突然停住了，因为他听到了一个非常明显的词，伴随着淡淡的香味。当然，那个词正是他的名字。

A bead of sweat suddenly formed on Shinji's forehead and cascaded down the side of his face before dripping off his chin and onto the bed spread.  
一滴汗水突然在真嗣的额头上形成，顺着他的脸颊滑落，最后从下巴滴落到床单上。

"Asu...ka?" His voice was so quiet that if a breeze had flown through the room, you would have thought he hadn't spoken a word. Be that as it may, he did say Asuka's name, for she was the person that had been laying next to him.  
“明日...香？”他的声音如此轻柔，仿佛一阵微风就能将其吹散，让人怀疑他是否真的说了话。尽管如此，他的确叫了明日香的名字，因为她正是躺在他身旁的那个人。

Utterly dumbfounded by something so stupefying, Shinji's hand dropped from where it was in mid air and landed with a loud 'thud' on the bed sheets. Shinji's first question, incredulous as it may be was, 'Okay what happened? And was I awake?'  
面对如此令人目瞪口呆的情况，真嗣悬在空中的手无力地垂下，重重地落在床单上，发出一声“砰”的响声。他难以置信的第一个问题是：“好吧，发生了什么？我当时醒着吗？”

Well, no, he wasn't awake, at least, he didn't think he was. He couldn't remember a time that he had awoken before this, though it didn't rule out the possibility that he had, and if so, what had happened between them to...instigate something such as this.  
嗯，不，他并没有醒着，至少，他不认为自己醒着。他不记得有哪次醒来是在这之前的，尽管这并不排除他曾经醒来的可能性，如果有的话，是什么事情让他们之间发生了...这样的事情。

'Think,' he told himself, 'if there was ever a time for some serious critical thinking, now was the time,' Nothing came to light of course.  
“思考，”他对自己说，“如果有什么时候需要认真地进行批判性思考，那就是现在了，”当然，什么也没想出来。

Now becoming more accustomed to the darkness, Shinji was able to pick out the few features of Asuka's face that he could see, and any misconception that it wasn't her, was completely blown away.  
现在对黑暗更加适应了，真嗣能够辨认出他能看到的几处明日香脸上的特征，任何关于她不是明日香的误解都彻底消失了。

Shinji wasn't sure if she had laid down like that originally, or had shifted towards the position eventually, but her face was pointed towards him. He supposed it was a miracle that he hadn't turned that way while he was sleeping. The thought of there first kiss as something as comical as this wasn't too endearing.  
真嗣不确定她最初是否就是那样躺着的，还是后来逐渐变成了那个姿势，但她的脸正对着他。他觉得，自己睡觉时没有转向那边真是个奇迹。将他们的初吻想象成如此滑稽的场景，并不太令人感到温馨。

It seemed that she had managed to bury herself quite comfortably in the covers as her head was just poking out of the flap of cloth that covered the majority of her head. She seemed to be curled up in a tight ball, and what Shinji had thought was her back, seemed to be her legs, drawn close together at the knees, so as to keep warm. Her eyes were peacefully closed, with her eyes lashes twitching every so slightly as she breathed deeply. To top it all off, her mouth was slightly open, revealing a small glimmer of her white teeth.  
她似乎已经设法在被子中找到了一个相当舒适的姿势，头只是从覆盖大部分头部的布料中露出来。她似乎蜷缩成一个紧实的球，而真嗣原以为那是她的背，实际上却是她的双腿，膝盖紧贴在一起以保暖。她的眼睛平静地闭着，眼睫毛微微颤动，随着深呼吸而动。最上面，她的嘴微微张开，露出一丝洁白的牙齿。

As Shinji took all this in, (albeit attempting not to stare too much) Asuka shifted slightly in her sleep again, flipping onto her back now, and pulling the covers down to just below her chin. It looked as though she was a neatly wrapped Christmas present, excluding the bow.  
当真嗣观察这一切时（尽管尽量不盯着看太久），明日香在睡梦中再次轻轻动了动，翻了个身仰躺着，将被子拉到下巴以下。她看起来就像一个包装整齐的圣诞礼物，除了没有蝴蝶结。

Shinji's eye twitched slightly at what he could only describe as a cuteness hardly found in Asuka. Her normal abrasive behavior had completely evaporated and the annoyed look she almost always wore while she looked at Shinji was gone. Though he had to remind himself that this was because she was asleep. He found it unpleasantly painful to be tested in such a way as this. How was it that he could pilot a giant, twenty foot robot, fight monsters that were bent on destroying humanity, and save the word, yet he got flustered over a silly experience with a fifteen year old girl?  
看到阿斯卡身上难得一见的可爱模样，真嗣的眼角微微抽动。她平日里的尖锐行为已完全消失，那几乎总是对着真嗣的恼怒表情也不见了。尽管他不得不提醒自己，这是因为她睡着了。这种考验让他感到异常痛苦。他如何能驾驶一架高达二十英尺的巨型机器人，与那些一心毁灭人类的怪物战斗，拯救世界，却在一个十五岁女孩的幼稚经历面前手足无措呢？

'This is really pathetic,' he thought.  
“这真是太可悲了，”他心想。

Bitting his lip slightly, he carefully sat down on the edge of the bed, careful to ignore the peaceful look on Asuka's face.  
他轻轻咬住下唇，小心翼翼地坐在床边，尽量不去看阿斯卡那安详的面容。

He figured he had two options available to him. One: he goes back to sleep and forget this ever happened, and two: wake Asuka up and take a gamble on the events that happen afterwards. Maybe it was because he was trying to change himself, because option one simply felt as though he was running away again, so he decided to stick with option two. A part of him had to admit that, even though waking her up might be a painful experience, he still wanted to hear her voice.  
他盘算着自己有两个选择。一是回去睡觉，当这一切都没发生过；二是叫醒明日香，赌一把接下来会发生什么。或许是因为他正试图改变自己，因为第一个选项让他感觉像是在逃避，所以他决定选择第二个。他不得不承认，尽管叫醒她可能会是一场痛苦的体验，但他仍然渴望听到她的声音。

And so, ever so carefully, he gently grasped Asuka's shoulder that was closest to him, and shook it. After several seconds of her not even flinching, he felt that maybe he should shake her a little harder, when her right arm came out of nowhere. Shinji who had been seconds away from letting out a loud shriek, let his breath subside, as he saw that she had merely moved her right hand, and position it over the top of his, which was still holding onto her shoulder.  
于是，他小心翼翼地，轻轻握住了离他最近的明日香的肩膀，摇了摇。她几秒钟内毫无反应，他觉得也许应该再用力一点，这时她的右手突然伸了出来。真嗣差点尖叫出声，但随即松了口气，因为她只是动了动右手，并把它放在了他仍握着她肩膀的手上。

'Why am I doing this,' he suddenly wondered before he finally called her name, first softly, but much firmer each repeated time. Eventually she relented.  
“我为什么要这么做，”他突然疑惑起来，但还是叫了她的名字，起初很轻，但每次重复都更加坚定。最终，她醒了过来。

First it was her eyelashes that flickered as her mind seemed to register the noise of his voice. Then the corners of her eyes twitched as they felt the darkness of the room creeping in. Finally after several more seconds of coaxing her, Asuka's right hand finally went to her eyes and started rubbing them absentmindedly.  
起初，是她的睫毛微微颤动，仿佛她的意识开始察觉到他声音的嘈杂。接着，眼角也随之抽动，感受到房间的黑暗逐渐逼近。终于，在经过几秒钟的哄劝后，明日香右手终于伸向眼睛，心不在焉地揉搓起来。

"Asuka...can you hear me?" Shinji asked slowly.  
“明日香……你能听到我说话吗？”真嗣缓缓问道。

Her simple response was, "Uhhhhhh..." He seemed to guess that meant yes, though he didn't think she realized exactly who she was talking to yet.  
她的简单回应是，“呃……”他似乎猜想那意味着肯定，尽管他认为她可能还没意识到自己在和谁说话。

After waiting a few more seconds, Asuka's right hand finally left her eyes, which slowly opened to reveal the darkness. Moving her head upwards slightly, she looked around briefly before flopping back down onto a pillow, which they had thankfully not been sharing.  
又等了几秒钟，明日香的右手终于从眼前移开，眼睛缓缓睁开，映入眼帘的是一片黑暗。她微微抬头，环顾四周后，又无力地倒回枕头上，还好他们没有共用一个枕头。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji again.  
“明日香？”真嗣再次问道。

He saw her tilt her head towards him in the darkness and heard her say a few undefinable words.  
他在黑暗中看到她将头转向他，并听到她含糊不清地说了几个字。

"Whozhat?" "谁在那儿？"

Guessing what she meant, Shinji let out a low chuckle and said, "...Shinji...of course.  
猜到她的意思，真嗣轻声笑了笑，说道：“……真嗣……当然。”

"Shinji?" she asked back as if she had never heard the word.  
"真嗣？" 她反问道，仿佛从未听过这个名字。

As her eyes started adjusting to the darkness and the drowsiness seemed to leave her, realization seemed to dawn on her and Shinji thought he saw her eyebrows sore into her bangs, while her mouth started opening in a loud gasp, before he managed to quickly say, "Don't scream, it will only make this worse.  
"当她的眼睛开始适应黑暗，困意似乎消散时，她似乎意识到了什么，真嗣觉得他看到她的眉毛紧蹙进刘海里，嘴巴正要张大呼气，他赶紧抢先说道：“别尖叫，那只会让情况更糟。”

Still not understanding what was actually happening, Asuka was under the delusion that they were both back at Misato's apartment and he had snuck into her room while she was asleep.  
仍然不明白究竟发生了什么，明日香误以为他们回到了美里小姐的公寓，而他趁她熟睡时偷偷溜进了她的房间。

"What. In. The. Hell. Are. You. Doing?" she annunciated with each word.  
“你。到。底。在。干。什。么？”她每个字都咬得清清楚楚。

Shinji stared back at her in amazement and whispered, "I should ask you the same thing. Isn't this Nerv?"  
真嗣惊讶地回望着她，低声说道：“我也想问你同样的问题。这里不是 NERV 吗？”

Hissing back at him, Asuka said, "What? This isn't Nerv, its...wait..."  
明日香对他嘶声回应道：“什么？这里不是 NERV，这是……等等……”

As the events of the previous day came flying back to Asuka, her entire face lit up like a Christmas light and Shinji was afraid that she was going to explode.  
当昨日的事件如潮水般涌回明日香的记忆中，她的整张脸亮得像圣诞彩灯一样，真嗣担心她会爆炸。

"Asuka calm dow-" "Asuka 冷静下来-"

"Calm down!" she hissed back, "How can I be calm when I...We...what are you doing here anyway? This is my-"  
"冷静点！"她低声回道，"我怎么可能冷静下来，当我...我们...你到底在这里做什么？这是我的-"

"_This_ is where I'm supposed to be...as for you," here Shinji's face turned slightly red as he finished, "well...you were next to me while I slept I guess."  
"这是我应该在的地方...至于你，"说到这里，Shinji 的脸微微泛红，他接着说，"嗯...我想我睡觉的时候你就在我旁边。"

Asuka opened her mouth and closed it furiously. "Thats impossible, yes I was sitting next to your bed for a while, but then I got tired and..."  
明日香张开嘴，又愤怒地闭上。“那不可能，没错，我是在你床边坐了一会儿，但后来我累了就……”

And what? She could vaguely remember the conversation she had had with herself over sleeping in the same bed as Shinji's, but she had won. She had told herself it was disgusting, so why in God's name was she waking up to find herself so close to him that she could almost smell his breath-  
然后呢？她隐约记得自己关于是否和真嗣同床共枕的那番自我辩论，但她赢了。她告诉自己那很恶心，那么为何上帝啊，她醒来时发现自己离他如此之近，几乎能闻到他的呼吸——

At this point, Shinji wouldn't have been surprised if smoke started gushing out of Asuka's ears. Shinji could almost feeling the heat coming off Asuka as she blushed furiously.  
此时此刻，如果明日香的耳朵开始冒烟，真嗣也不会感到惊讶。他几乎能感受到明日香因脸红而散发出的热气。

"This is somehow your fault," she managed to say in between breaths.  
"这怎么就成了你的错呢？" 她喘着气勉强说道。

"How is you sleeping next to me my fault?"  
"你躺在我旁边睡觉怎么就成了我的错？"

"I don't kno-" "我不知-"

Shinji just managed to plant the palm of his hand over her mouth as she was close to yelling her words through the room. Shinji didn't want to think what people would say if they caught them in an embarrassing situation as this.  
真嗣及时将手掌捂在她的嘴上，她差点就对着房间大喊出声。真嗣不敢想象如果人们看到他们陷入这种尴尬境地会怎么议论。

After several seconds of being glared at by Asuka, Shinji realized that he still had his hand covering her mouth and quickly took it back.  
在被明日香瞪了几秒钟后，真嗣意识到自己还用手捂着她的嘴，赶紧把手缩了回来。

"Sorry," he mumbled, "but I don't think its a good idea for people to...see us like this. Wrong misconception."  
“对不起，”他咕哝道，“但我觉得让别人……看到我们这样不太好。误会就大了。”

Asuka glared at him for a while before letting an indignant, "Hmph," escape her lips, before she rolled over and faced the side that wasn't facing Shinji, and more importantly, causing her to feel as though she had a strong head cold.  
明日香瞪了他一会儿，然后不满地哼了一声，转过身去，背对着真嗣，更重要的是，这让她感觉自己像是得了重感冒。

After several seconds of silence, Asuka surprisingly broke it.  
沉默了几秒钟后，明日香出人意料地打破了沉默。

"So...how do you feel?" “那么……你感觉怎么样？”

Surprised that she had asked so soon, Shinji turned toward her and said, "Better, I suppose. I wont know for certain until Ritsuko gives me a thorough medical examine though."  
惊讶于她这么快就问了，真嗣转向她，说道：“应该好些了吧。不过要等律子给我做一次彻底的体检才能确定。”

"Hmmm? You scared everyone half to death you know. I've never seen Misato in such a state of hysteria when the managed to drag you out of the entry plug. Even Ritsuko was showing remorse. Everyone had thought you had lost to much blood, but it seemed as though your body absorbed some of the LCL fluid as something of a placeholder, while your red blood cells replenished themselves."  
“嗯？你可把大家都吓得半死，知道吗？我从没见过美里那么歇斯底里的样子，当他们把你从插入栓里拖出来时。连律子都显得很懊悔。大家都以为你失血过多，但似乎你的身体吸收了一些 LCL 液体作为临时的替代，同时你的红细胞在自我补充。”

"I...what?" “我……什么？”

"I don't know," mumbled Asuka quietly, "its just what I heard..."  
"我不知道，" 明日香小声嘟囔着，"我只是听说的……"

Shinji suddenly felt very violated at the thought of LCL fluid flowing through his veins.  
一想到 LCL 溶液在血管中流动，真嗣突然感到一种被侵犯的感觉。

"What about you," he suddenly asked, "how did you...deal with what had happened?"  
"那你呢，" 他突然问道，"你是怎么……处理发生的事情的？"

Asuka was silent for a minute before she titled her head in his direction slightly. Sighing deeply, she rolled onto her back and started talking towards the ceiling.  
明日香沉默了一会儿，然后微微侧头朝向他。她深深叹了口气，翻过身来仰躺着，开始对着天花板说话。

"I was out for the majority of everything that happened. I awoke right when they were recovering Unit 01 and I remember thinking, 'where is Shinji?' I felt well enough to walk so I grabbed a shirt and some sweats and made my way to the Evangelion's chamber. When I saw that they had managed to recover you I...well I'm not really sure how to say it. I felt relief I suppose, even thought I didn't know whether you were truly alive or dead, though I guess a part of me knew that you were."  
“在那场事件中，我大部分时间都处于昏迷状态。当我醒来时，他们正在回收初号机，我记得我当时在想，‘真嗣在哪里？’我感觉身体还行，就抓了件衬衫和运动裤，朝 EVA 的机库走去。当我看到他们成功将你救出时，我……嗯，我不知道该怎么表达。我想我感到了一种解脱，尽管我不确定你是生是死，但我想我内心深处知道你还活着。”

"Whys that?" Shinji asked softly.  
“为什么这么说？”真嗣轻声问道。

"I don't know...maybe because of what you said yesterday to me, about coming back."  
"我不知道...可能是因为你昨天对我说的话，关于回来的事。"

Shinji flushed slightly as he recalled his own words.  
真嗣想起自己的话，脸上微微泛红。

"And its a good thing that you did keep your promise-," replied Asuka, her tone suddenly growing cold.  
"你遵守了承诺是件好事-," 明日香回答道，语气突然变得冷淡。

Shinji face changed from a light shade of maroon to pale white so fast you'd have thought he had been kicked in the groin.  
真嗣的脸色从淡淡的绯红迅速转为苍白，快得让人以为他被踢中了下体。

"-because I would have beaten you to a living pulp and dragged your ass half way around town making you buy stuff for me if I so much as thought you had left."  
"-因为如果我稍微觉得你离开了，我就会把你揍得半死不活，然后拖着你的屁股在镇上转悠，逼你给我买东西。"

"...But I'm here," said Shinji, trying to remedy the problem.  
"...但我在这里，" 真嗣试图解决问题。

Asuka contained her silence as she continued to look up at the ceiling.  
明日香保持着沉默，继续抬头望着天花板。

"I suppose you are," she said after a few moments passed. Suddenly inhaling sharply, she filled her lungs up to the brim with fresh oxygen and released it as words came spiraling out of her mouth.  
“我想你是吧，”她几分钟后说道。突然深吸一口气，将新鲜的氧气充满肺部，然后随着话语喷涌而出。

"_And..._I suppose that I'm glad you are here."  
“而且……我想我很高兴你在这里。”

Shinji's mouth opened slightly in surprise at her words, but it was more the fact that she was smiling when she had said it that shocked Shinji.  
听到她的话，真嗣的嘴微微张开，感到惊讶，但更让他震惊的是，她说这话时竟然在微笑。

"Now then," muttered Asuka as she turned towards Shinji with a slight smirk on her face.  
“那么现在，”明日香转头对着真嗣低声说道，脸上带着一丝得意的微笑。

Shinji felt as though a large wave was about to crash into him and was about to take a step back when Asuka said, "Out."  
真嗣感觉仿佛一股巨浪即将向他袭来，正要后退一步时，明日香说了一句：“出去。”

"...Hu-" "...呼-"

"Out," she repeated. "出去，" 她重复道。

"Asuka wha-" "明日香，什——"

"Out, or if not sleep on the floor."  
"出去，或者不出去就睡地板。"

Finally understanding what Asuka was getting at, Shinji raised an eyebrow and said, "What? You don't want me slee-"  
终于明白了明日香的意思，真嗣挑了挑眉毛说：“什么？你不想让我睡——”

Asuka's hand came soaring out of nowhere and grabbed one of Shinji's ears, tugging on it painfully. Putting most of his self control into not yelling, Shinji desperately whispered back, "Ow, Asuka that hurts."  
明日香的手不知从哪儿猛地伸出来，一把抓住了真嗣的耳朵，用力拉扯，疼得他直咧嘴。真嗣强忍着不喊出声，急忙低声回道：“哎哟，明日香，疼啊。”

"Don't even think of something like that," she snarled back. "Its completely and utterly disgust-"  
“想都别想那种事，”她恶狠狠地回敬道，“那简直是完全彻底的恶心——”

"You're the one that crawled in here in the first place, and in case you forgot this isn't the first ti-"  
"你才是最先爬进这里的那个人，而且如果你忘了这不是第一次——"

If Asuka had been embarrassed before, it was nothing to how she looked now. Her entire face lit up like an overripe cherry. Her eyes grew as wide as a child's does when it sees a large stack of presents under the Christmas tree. Her entire body seemed to draw backwards in surprise at what Shinji said, and if Shinji wasn't mistaken, he thought he saw that her eyes had started to water.  
如果说之前明日香还只是感到尴尬，那么现在她的表情简直无法用言语形容。她的整张脸红得像一颗熟透的樱桃。她的眼睛瞪得像孩子看到圣诞树下一大堆礼物时那样大。她的整个身体似乎因为惊讶而向后缩，如果真嗣没看错的话，他觉得她的眼睛已经开始泛泪了。

Realizing that he might have said too much, Shinji opened his mouth and reached out towards her to apologize, when she slapped his hand away saying, "Forget it."  
意识到自己可能说得太过分了，真嗣张开嘴，伸出手想要道歉，却被她一巴掌拍开，说道：“算了。”

Asuka then turned away from him and crawled towards the very edge of the bed, where she was likely to fall off.  
随后，明日香转过身去，爬向床的边缘，那里她很可能会掉下去。

Surprised at this sudden turn of events, Shinji sat on the edge of the bed for a minute, wondering what he should do when Asuka said with a slight hint of malice in her voice, "I can't sleep with you sitting on the edge of the bed, so either stay or don't. Just do something damn it."  
对这突如其来的转变感到惊讶，真嗣坐在床边，思考着该怎么办，这时明日香带着一丝恶意说道：“我没法和你坐在床边的人一起睡，要么留下，要么离开。快点决定吧。”

Taken aback at what she had said, Shinji hesitated for a fraction of a second before carefully swinging his legs up onto the bed, careful not to brush against hers in the process. Folding the covers back, he slid his legs under them, during which he was almost positive that Asuka's heart rate had skyrocketed through her chest at his actions.  
听到她的话，真嗣愣了一下，然后小心翼翼地把腿抬上床，过程中尽量避免碰到她的腿。他掀开被子，把腿伸进去，期间几乎可以肯定明日香的心跳因为他的动作而急剧加速。

'Well this isn't awkward,' Shinji thought sarcastically. 'Just two confused teenagers sleeping in the same bed with the lights off and God knows what time it is in the morning. Nope...every things fine.'  
“好吧，这并不尴尬。” 真嗣讽刺地想。“只是两个困惑的青少年在熄灯后睡在同一张床上，天知道现在早上几点了。不...一切都很好。”

'Like hell it is,' said a voice in his mind, but he ignored it.  
“才怪。” 他脑海中有个声音说道，但他选择无视。

Next to him, Asuka was sweating profusely. Why the hell had she said the things she had said? What in the hell had she been thinking at the time? And furthermore, why did she feel like she didn't care deep down. So Shinji had been right about her crawling into bed with him before, but that had been very different. First they weren't even using the same sheets or pillows, she had seen to that herself. Then he had become uncomfortable and left and she had fallen asleep in his room. What would happen now though? Would he eventually become uncomfortable and vacate to the floor? And why the fuck did she feel as though she didn't want that?  
在他旁边，明日香大汗淋漓。她到底为什么会说出那些话？当时她到底在想什么？而且更深层次地，为什么她觉得她并不在乎。虽然真嗣之前确实猜对了她爬上他的床，但那次情况完全不同。首先他们甚至没有使用相同的床单或枕头，她亲自确保了这一点。然后他感到不舒服就离开了，而她在他的房间里睡着了。现在会发生什么呢？他会最终感到不舒服然后睡到地板上吗？为什么她觉得她并不希望那样？

Just as she was about to turn towards him and ask him if he had considered sleeping on the floor at all, Shinji instead caught her off guard with his own question.  
正当她准备转向他，问他是否考虑过睡地板时，真嗣却出其不意地先发制人，提出了自己的问题。

"Hey Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

"What," she snapped back, not meaning to, but in her surprise she did anyway.  
“什么，”她不假思索地回呛，虽然并非本意，但在惊讶中还是脱口而出了。

"I know that you don't like this any better than I do, but don't fall off the edge of the bed just because of this..."  
"我知道你和我一样不喜欢这样，但别因为这个就从床边掉下去..."

Asuka realized what he meant, as both her legs were practically dangly over the side of the bed, while both her arms were almost able to touch the wall on her side of the bed.  
明日香意识到他的意思，她的双腿几乎悬在床边，而双臂几乎能触碰到她那侧的墙壁。

"Thats," she started, but Shinji cut her off.  
"那个，"她刚开口，但真嗣打断了她。

"I'm just saying...we should...share the space."  
"我只是说...我们应该...共享这个空间。"

"Perv-" "变态-"

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"Fine, don't complain to me if I push you off your side of the bed though.  
"好吧，如果你被我挤下床去，可别怪我。"

Shinji felt her body shift suddenly, and was starting to regret his words when he felt a soft 'plunk' land very close to his back. Next second, her silky hair brushed up against his back, but she seemed to noticed it, and tucked it behind her head. If Shinji were to turn towards her now, his noes would be a mere centimeter away from her back.  
真嗣感觉到她的身体突然移动，正开始后悔自己的话时，他感到一个柔软的'扑通'声落在离他背部非常近的地方。下一秒，她的丝滑头发拂过他的背部，但她似乎注意到了，便将其拢到脑后。如果真嗣现在转身面对她，他的鼻子离她的背部只有一厘米的距离。

Feeling the awkwardness of there close proximity, neither was really sure if a conversation was even start-able at this point.  
感受到如此近距离的尴尬，两人都不确定此时是否还能开始对话。

Asuka suddenly drew in a sharp breath, and let it out all at once as she sneezed. Shinji, without even a seconds thought replied, "Bless you..."  
明日香突然深吸一口气，然后一下子打了个喷嚏。真嗣毫不犹豫地回应道："保佑你..."

"...Thanks," replied Asuka.  
"...谢谢," 明日香回答道。

There nervousness suddenly evaporated with this simple action, and if somebody had entered while they had been sleeping, they would have sworn that they had fallen asleep while facing each other.  
这个简单的动作突然让他们的紧张感消失了，如果有人在他们睡觉时进来，肯定会发誓他们是在面对面睡着的情况下入睡的。

The next morning was rather hectic when Shinji woke up. He had momentarily forgotten about the incident with Asuka last night, and thought nothing of it as he rolled onto his other side. Of course he was inches away from kissing her. It took Shinji several minutes to remember everything that had happened...well, what he supposed was earlier in the morning, since he assumed that it was morning by now. When he did though, he felt as though his head was about to explode.  
第二天早上，真嗣醒来时相当忙碌。他一时忘记了昨晚和明日香发生的事情，翻了个身也没在意。当然，他差点就亲到了她。真嗣花了好几分钟才想起昨晚发生的一切...嗯，他猜应该是早上发生的事，因为他现在认为是早上。当他想起来时，他感觉自己的头都要炸了。

'How the hell had it come to this,' he wondered.  
“这他妈是怎么回事，”他暗自思忖。

Maybe it was an unspoken thing between them, something that really didn't need to be said. Maybe they had already excepted how close they were to each other, and just took this as another thing that drew them closer. Certainly they felt awkward about it, as any other couple of fifteen year olds would, but it was more the fact that they didn't want to accept how they felt about each other. Neither of them had a clear understanding of what love was, but both of them had felt the feeling of it in there lives.  
或许这是他们之间心照不宣的事，无需言明。也许他们早已接受了彼此间的亲密，将其视为拉近关系的又一因素。当然，他们对此感到尴尬，就像任何一对十五岁的情侣一样，但更多的是他们不愿承认彼此间的感情。他们俩都不清楚什么是爱，但都曾在生活中感受到过那种感觉。

And so it was that Shinji felt this as he watched Asuka slowly open her eyes.  
于是，当真嗣看着明日香缓缓睁开眼睛时，他感受到了这一切。

It was still dark in the room, but not nearly as dark as it had been early in the morning. As Asuka slowly opened her eyes, the first thing that her eyes latched onto was Shinji, since he practically took up her entire field of vision.  
房间里依然昏暗，但远不及清晨时分那般漆黑。当明日香缓缓睁开双眼，映入眼帘的第一件事物便是真嗣，因为他几乎占据了她的整个视野。

Asuka's lips parted slightly as she saw Shinji and she momentarily, (just as Shinji) forgot what had happened earlier in the night. Realizing that his lips were a mere inches away from her own, she scooted to the very edge of the bed, and almost fell out of it.  
看到真嗣时，明日香的嘴唇微微张开，她短暂地（就像真嗣一样）忘记了昨晚发生的事情。意识到他的嘴唇距离自己的仅几英寸之遥，她迅速挪到床边，差点摔下床去。

"What the fuck are you doing you pervert-"  
“你这个变态在干什么——”

Shinji quickly cut her off by saying, "Sorry, I woke up like this...  
真嗣迅速打断她，说道：“抱歉，我醒来就这样了……”

Asuka gaped like a fish out of water briefly before she glared at Shinji and said, "You didn't do anything-"  
明日香短暂地像离水的鱼一样张口结舌，随即瞪着真嗣说：“你什么都没做——”

"No, of course not-" “不，当然没有——”

"because if you did I'd have to break that plastic chair over your head."  
"因为如果你真的这么做了，我就得把那塑料椅子砸你头上。"

Shinji recoiled at the threat in her voice, and shrank back to the far side of his own bed. And here he had thought that after the end of last night, things would have improved greatly for them. Asuka though, seemed to have barely changed in the slightest.  
听到她声音中的威胁，真嗣吓得退到了自己床的另一边。他本以为经历了昨晚的结束，他们之间的关系会有很大改善。但明日香似乎一点都没变。

"How'd you sleep?" asked Shinji the moment he felt that it was okay for him to venture into that territory.  
"你睡得怎么样？" 真嗣一觉得可以进入那个领域就问道。

"Terrible," she replied, "My back aches, my neck is sore, I have a pounding headache, and my eyes are suffering from having to look at you so much lately."  
"糟糕透了，"她回答，"我的背疼，脖子酸，头痛欲裂，而且最近老得看着你，眼睛都受罪了。"

'So in other words,' though Shinji, 'no difference what so ever.'  
'换句话说，' 绫波心想，'根本没什么区别。'

"This hospital bed sucks," she finished. "I don't know how I managed to sleep on this uncomfortable bed this entire time.  
"这医院的床真差劲，"她最后说道，"我真不知道自己是怎么在这张不舒服的床上熬过这么长时间的。"

'Probably because you were drugged up half the time,' thought Shinji as he got off the bed, being sure to not give Asuka anything else to gripe about.  
'大概是因为你有一半时间都在药物作用下吧，' 真嗣一边想一边从床上下来，确保不给明日香任何其他抱怨的理由。

With the darkness not quite complete as it had been last night, Asuka had got a bit more of an eyeful of Shinji then she had ever intended...or cared for.  
由于黑暗并未像昨晚那样完全笼罩，明日香比她原本打算的——或者说她愿意的——多看了真嗣一眼...或者更多。

As Shinji stood up, both him and Asuka realized that he had a hospital gown on, the kind that has the revealing flap in the back. As he pushed himself off the bed, the resounded force sent the flap soaring upwards, revealing his naked back and a little more in the process.  
当真嗣站起来时，他和明日香都意识到他穿着一件医院病号服，那种背后有开衩的款式。当他用力离开床时，反作用力使得开衩猛地向上翻起，露出了他赤裸的背部以及更多。

Shinji didn't realize immediately what he was wearing, though Asuka certainly did. Her face turned bright red and she felt as though her eyes were about to burn out of her socket. If steam could have erupted out of her ears, they would have.  
真嗣并没有立刻意识到自己穿了什么，但明日香却一眼看穿了。她的脸涨得通红，感觉眼睛都快从眼眶里烧出来了。如果蒸汽能从她的耳朵里喷出来，那一定会喷涌而出。

Stammering heavily, as though she had a speech impairment, she replied, "Shi-Shi-Shin-Shinji..."  
她结结巴巴地回答，仿佛有语言障碍一般，"真-真-真-真嗣..."

"What?" he replied as he turned his head towards her, shifting the flap so that it briefly revealed his hips, and a little more than Asuka cared to comment on.  
“什么？”他转头向她问道，移动了下遮布，短暂地露出了他的臀部，以及一些明日香不愿多言的部分。

Yelling much louder than she intended, Asuka cried back, "You disgusting pervert! You're naked underneath that!"  
阿斯卡大声喊道，声音比她预想的还要响亮：“你这个恶心的变态！你下面什么都没穿！”

"I am?" asked Shinji as he turned his head to try to look behind him. He thought it had felt oddly drafty back there.  
“是吗？”真嗣转过头试图看向身后，他觉得那里感觉异常通风。

"Yes you are," yelled Asuka back, with her eyes firmly closed now. "So get out of here and change before I-"  
“是的，你就是！”阿斯卡闭着眼睛大声回应，“所以快离开这里换衣服，不然我——”

Asuka cut herself off mid sentence when she realized what she had been about to say. Shinji raised an eyebrow in her direction wondering what she could possibly thinking. Shrugging his shoulders then, he walked to the door and realized that the latch to open it was much lower than he would ever have guessed last night. Turning his head around, he glanced at Asuka who's head was turned away from him, but he was almost certain that she could see him in her peripheral vision.  
明日香话说到一半突然打住，意识到自己差点说了什么。真嗣向她挑了挑眉，好奇她到底在想什么。他耸耸肩，走向门口，发现开门闩的位置比他昨晚猜测的要低得多。他转过头，瞥了一眼明日香，她的头转向另一边，但他几乎可以肯定她能用余光看到他。

"What?" she finally snapped at him.  
“什么？”她终于不耐烦地对他吼道。

"Nothing," replied Shinji shaking his head. He didn't think it best to ask why she had locked the door.  
“没什么，”真嗣摇摇头回答。他认为最好不要问她为什么锁门。

Turning back towards the door, he slipped his finger under the latch and lifted up on it. Grabbing the door handle he opened it inward, and almost walked head first into Misato who had her hand poised in midair, about to knock on it.  
转身面向门口，他将手指滑到门闩下轻轻抬起。抓住门把手，他向内推开门，差点一头撞上正举手准备敲门的美里。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Misato?" "美里？"

"Moron," Shinji thought he heard Asuka whisper behind him.  
“笨蛋，”真嗣觉得他听到背后的明日香低声嘀咕。

After picking themselves off the floor, Misato gazed back at Shinji and suddenly threw her arms over his shoulders and brought him into a motherly hug.  
从地上爬起来后，美里回头看着真嗣，突然张开双臂搂住他的肩膀，给了他一个充满母爱的拥抱。

"Shinji you're okay. How do you feel? Does anything hurt? How is your-"  
"真嗣，你没事吧？感觉怎么样？有没有哪里疼？你——"

"I feel fine Misato...really."  
"我感觉很好，美里...真的。"

"But you..." "但是你..."

"He's completely fine," said Asuka suddenly speaking up from where she was still tangled in the beds blankets.  
"他完全没事，" 明日香突然从她仍裹在床单里的位置开口说道。

Misato, just noticing that she was also in the room, parted her mouth slightly in surprise while her eyes narrowed slightly.  
美里这才注意到她也在房间里，微微张开嘴表示惊讶，同时眼睛略微眯起。

"Asuka...what are you doing here, and-"  
"明日香...你在这里做什么，而且-"

"Nothing that should worry you," replied Asuka, signaling to Misato that she wasn't keen on the subject.  
“没什么好担心的，”明日香回答道，向美里示意她不想深入这个话题。

"...Right," replied Misato after a moments pause, though she would expect a better explanation later.  
“……好吧，”美里顿了一下后回答，尽管她期待稍后能得到更详细的解释。

Turning towards Shinji, she said, "Shinji I know this is rather sudden but we need to run some tests on you-"  
她转向真嗣，说道：“真嗣，我知道这有点突然，但我们需要对你进行一些测试——”

"That is no longer necessary," said a voice behind Misato.  
“那已经没有必要了。”一个声音在美里身后响起。

Turning around, Misato saw that Ritsuko was standing behind her with a clipboard under her arm and a cup of coffee in the other. Whats more she had a large smile on her face.  
美里转过身，看到律子站在她身后，腋下夹着一块写字板，另一只手端着一杯咖啡。更让她惊讶的是，律子脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。

"Shinji's lung has regrown itself somehow. Whether its because of some lingering affect from Unit 01 unique ability to regenerate, or Shinji's own physiological make up, I don't know. But the scar tissue that formed over his missing lung originally, seems to have molded in a full working lung."  
“真嗣的肺不知怎么地自行再生了。无论是由于初号机独特再生能力的残留影响，还是真嗣自身生理结构的缘故，我不清楚。但他原本缺失的肺部形成的瘢痕组织，似乎已经重塑成一个功能完备的肺。”

"How is that possible?" asked Misato. "I thought that certain cells have certain functions that they only regulate."  
"这怎么可能？" 美里问道。"我以为某些细胞只有特定的功能，只能调节特定的事项。"

"Normally yes, but it isn't to far a stretch to assume that Shinji's cells may function differently than the average human though. Don't forget that each cell in his body has a very small strand of angel DNA."  
"通常来说是的，但考虑到真嗣的细胞可能与普通人类的功能不同，这并不算太牵强。别忘了，他体内的每个细胞都含有极少量的使徒 DNA。"

"Can we finish this so I can go back to bed?" said Asuka interrupting the biology lesson, clearly displeased about how things were going.  
"我们能结束这个话题，让我回去睡觉吗？" 明日香打断了生物课，显然对事情的发展感到不悦。"

Ritsuko noticed then, just as Misato had done a little while ago that Asuka was in the room Shinji had slept in. Turning towards Misato, she raised and eyebrow at Misato who's nostrils seemed to be flaring.  
那时，丽津子注意到了，就像不久前美里所做的那样，明日香在真嗣曾经睡过的房间里。她转向美里，挑了挑眉毛，而美里的鼻孔似乎在扩张。

"Then if there isn't any tests I need to take, I need to find some clothes...and something to eat."  
“那么，如果没有我需要参加的测试，我需要找些衣服……还有吃点东西。”

"Thats the other thing I had meant to tell you," said Misato, "you've been given the day off...you and Asuka."  
“那是我本来想告诉你的另一件事，”美里说，“你今天放假……你和明日香。”

"Wha-" "什-"

"I know that recent events have been rather...trying on the both of you. So today I put in a request for leave time for both of you. No school, no synchronization tests, no on standby in case an angel attacks, just take the day off."  
"我知道最近的事情对你们俩来说都相当...考验。所以今天我为你们俩申请了休假时间。不用上学，不用同步测试，也不用随时待命以防使徒袭击，就好好休息一天吧。"

Shinji's mouth opened slightly but he quickly closed it.  
真嗣的嘴微微张开，但很快又闭上了。

"I still need clothes though-"  
"但我还需要衣服——"

"Taken care of," said Misato as she suddenly tossed several pieces of clothing that had been slung over her shoulder.  
"处理好了，" 美里说着，突然将几件搭在肩上的衣服扔了出去。

"As for food...well frankly Nerv provisions have been cut short recently with the angel attacks. I'd recommend that you both find something in Tokyo-3 somewhere."  
"至于食物……坦白说，由于天使的袭击，NERV 的补给最近已经减少了。我建议你们俩在东京-3 的某个地方找点吃的。"

"Both?" asked Asuka speaking up again.  
"俩？" 明日香再次开口问道。

"Yes...both," replied Misato, peering around Shinji to get a better look at Asuka. "Since neither of you will be needed, its best if you just go out and have a good time...together."  
“是的……两个都来，”美里回答道，透过真嗣的肩膀仔细打量着明日香。“既然你们俩都不需要做什么，最好还是一起出去好好玩一玩。”

The look on Asuka's face was rather skeptical until she finally said, "Well, I suppose I can always have Shinji carry the bags after I go shopping."  
明日香脸上的表情颇为怀疑，直到她最后说道：“好吧，我想我可以随时让真嗣在我购物后提包。”

'Wonderful,' thought Shinji.  
“太好了，”真嗣心想。

"Great," said Misato. "Asuka your clothes are in _your_ room, so if you could go change, Shinji can change right here."  
“好极了，”美里说，“明日香，你的衣服在你房间里，你去换吧，真嗣可以在这里换。”

Asuka didn't like the way that Misato had emphasized your, when referring to where she was supposed to sleep.  
明日香不喜欢美里在提到她该睡在哪里时强调“你的”那种方式。

Sighing slightly, Asuka said, "Fine, I'll get up."  
明日香轻轻叹了口气，说：“好吧，我起床。”

It was then that Misato felt something she should have been aware of, but she was a bit late as Asuka slithered out from under the covers, and Shinji's face turned the color of a tomato.  
就在那时，Misato 感受到了本该察觉到的东西，但为时已晚，因为 Asuka 从被窝里滑了出来，而 Shinji 的脸涨得通红，像颗番茄一样。

You had to honestly assume that some force had possessed Asuka's body and mind last night when she had gotten in bed with Shinji, for no amount of alcohol, hormone malfunction, or teenage romance, could have forced Asuka into bed with Shinji...unless it was completely intentional on her part. As Asuka slid out of the covers, it was revealed what she was wearing. She had a short, loose, light blue tang top on that fell just above her waist so that if she threw her arms in the air, it would reveal the smooth skin of her stomach. As she tumbled out of the blankets, Shinji saw that the right strap holding the tang top on her shoulders had fallen down, and was now dangling in a free fall just above her elbow. If the right side of the tang top had fallen just a little more, Shinji would have gotten a glimpse of her right breast. Below was much worse, and it was here that Shinji's eyes had inadvertently darted when her, 'nakedness' was revealed before him. Her underwear consisted of white and blue stripped, cotton panties, with interlacing laces that held the underwear together at her hips. Quite frankly, it looked more like swimwear than anything else.  
你不得不诚实地认为，昨晚明日香与真嗣同床共枕时，她的身心一定被某种力量所占据，因为无论多少酒精、激素失调或青春期的浪漫情怀，都无法迫使明日香与真嗣同床共枕……除非这是她完全有意为之。当明日香从被窝中滑出时，她所穿的衣物显露了出来。她身着一件宽松的浅蓝色短款唐装上衣，衣摆刚好垂至腰际，若她举起双臂，便会露出平滑的腹部肌肤。在她从被子里滚出时，真嗣注意到她肩上的右肩带已经滑落，此刻正自由垂落于她的肘部上方。如果唐装上衣的右侧再下滑一点，真嗣就能瞥见她的右胸。而下半身则更为糟糕，当她的“赤裸”展现在真嗣眼前时，他的目光不由自主地被吸引到了那里。她的内裤是蓝白条纹的棉质款式，腰部以交织的蕾丝固定。坦白说，这看起来更像是泳装而非其他。

Shinji's mind drew a complete blank. Since when had Asuka started wearing stuff such as thi-  
真嗣的脑海一片空白。从什么时候起，明日香开始穿这种东西——

His train of thought was interrupted however as a plastic chair came hurtling towards him. Asuka, seeing the look on Shinji's face at her lack of proper etiquette, picked up the chair and thought nothing except wiping that look of his face.  
然而，他的思绪被一把飞来的塑料椅子打断了。明日香看到真嗣因为她缺乏礼仪而露出的表情，便抓起椅子，心中只有一个念头，那就是抹去他脸上的那种表情。

Shinji could very well have blocked it, or sliced it in half with a simple thought with his AT-field, but maybe it was because it was Asuka who was trying to hurt him that he didn't even think of protecting himself. Instead, he moved to his left slightly, as the chair went soaring past his right ear. Thankfully, both Ritsuko and Misato had seen what he was doing and managed to get out of the way in time.  
真嗣本可以轻易挡下椅子，或者用他的 AT 力场一念之间将其劈成两半，但或许是因为试图伤害他的是明日香，他甚至没有想到要保护自己。相反，他微微向左移动，椅子从他的右耳旁呼啸而过。幸运的是，律子和美里都看到了他的举动，及时躲开了。

Asuka however was not about to relent and with her face the color of maroon, she started grabbing every object within her reach that had even the slightest chance of hurting him, and flung it at him.  
然而，明日香并没有打算就此罢休，她的脸涨得通红，开始抓起手边任何有可能伤到他的东西，一股脑儿地朝他扔去。

"Asu...ka...calm...down," said Shinji, each word said as he dodged flying objects.  
"明...日...香...冷...静...点，" 真嗣一边躲避飞来的物品，一边断断续续地说道。

"YOU UNBELIEVABLE HORNY BASTARD," she shrieked back at him. "WHAT DID YOU EXPECT YOU FUCKING MORON? THAT I'D SLEEP IN JEANS?"  
"你这个无可救药的色狼混蛋，" 她尖声回敬道，"你他妈的蠢货，你以为我会穿着牛仔裤睡觉吗？"

"Asuka calm down already," said Shinji, trying not to laugh and failing miserably.  
“Asuka，冷静点啦，”Shinji 说着，努力不笑出声却惨败。

"WHY THE HELL ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU HORNY PERVERT?" she yelled back at him as she picked up the lamp side table and threw it at him.  
“你他妈笑什么笑，你这个色情狂！”她朝他吼回去，顺手抓起床头柜上的台灯扔向他。

Dodging it easily, Shinji said back while laughing, "Sorry...its just that it was funny and cute of you I suppose."  
轻松躲开后，Shinji 边笑边回道：“抱歉……只是觉得你那样挺有趣也挺可爱的。”

The air was suddenly devoid of objects bent on breaking Shinji's neck.  
空气中突然没有了那些意图折断真嗣脖子的物体。

"What!" Asuka managed to say in between breaths. "Did you just call me cute!"  
“什么！” 明日香喘着气说，“你刚才说我可爱！”

"Anything wrong with that?"  
“有什么问题吗？”

"Yeah there is, I don't want to hear something as disgusting as that, especially from you!"  
“是啊，我可不想听这么恶心的事，尤其是从你嘴里说出来！”

Shinji simply rolled his eyes and said, "Whatever you say. I'll go find a bathroom to change and you can just change here then."  
真嗣只是翻了个白眼，说道：“随你怎么说。我去洗手间换衣服，你就在这儿换吧。”

Walking past Misato and Ritsuko who where both gaping like fish out of water, Shinji rolled his clothes up into a small bundle and walked down the corridor, looking for a bathroom.  
真嗣从目瞪口呆的美里和律子身边走过，把衣服卷成一个小包，沿着走廊寻找洗手间。

Asuka blinked, realizing that he was gone as silent fury radiated off of her.  
明日香眨了眨眼，意识到他已经离开，而她身上散发出的无声怒火愈发强烈。

"I'll just go get your clothes then," said Misato, trying to sound casual.  
“那我去帮你拿衣服吧，”美里说道，试图显得随意些。

"Whatever," replied Asuka.  
“随便，”明日香回答道。

When Misato and Ritsuko both left, Asuka bolted upward and closed the door before anybody would be able to peer in and see her like this. Turning around, she sat back down on the bed and put a pillow in her lap where she buried her head in.  
当美里和律子都离开后，明日香猛地坐起身来，关上门以防任何人窥见她此刻的模样。她转过身，重新坐回床上，将一个枕头放在膝间，把头埋了进去。

'Out of the few days I had chosen to wear that particular piece of underwear, why was today the one day that Shinji had had to see them,' she thought.  
她心想：'在我选择穿那件特定内衣的几天里，为什么偏偏是今天，真嗣看到了它们？'

Punching the side of the pillow to mold it into a better shape, she let out a low sigh and said quietly, "He thought I was cute though? Don't give me that kind of crap. Stupid...idiot...embarrassing me like that."  
她用力捶打枕头的侧面，使其形状更合适，然后低声叹息道："他觉得我可爱？别给我这种鬼话。笨蛋……白痴……害我这么尴尬。"

Even so, why was her heart beating like crazy, and why did she feel so warm inside?  
即便如此，为什么她的心跳得如此疯狂，为什么她感到内心如此温暖？

"Disgusting," she mumbled again before Misato came in with clothes and thankfully, a different pair of underwear. Asuka had a feeling she wouldn't be able to wear these without remembering this painful experience ever again.  
"恶心，"她又咕哝了一声，随后美里带着衣服进来了，谢天谢地，还有另一条内裤。明日香有种感觉，她再也无法穿着这些衣物而不再次想起这段痛苦的经历了。

---

"So where exactly are we going?" asked Asuka, clearly still grumpy about earlier events.  
"那我们到底要去哪儿？"明日香问道，显然对之前的事情仍感到不悦。

"A place," said Shinji simply.  
"一个地方。" 真嗣简单地回答道。

"And what place is that?" Asuka snapped back at him.  
"那是什么地方？" 明日香立刻反问他。

"I found it while walking around Tokyo-3 yesterday."  
"昨天我在第三新东京市闲逛时发现的。"

"And what? You just decided to take me to it?"  
"然后呢？你就这么决定带我去那儿了？"

"Well...something like that I suppose, though theres somebody I want you to meet also."  
"嗯...差不多吧，不过我还想让你见一个人。"

Asuka let out a low 'Hmph' and continued walking down the side walk, leaving Shinji trailing behind her.  
明日香发出一声低沉的'哼'，继续沿着人行道走下去，留下真嗣在她身后跟着。

Shinji let out a low sigh and had to wonder why Asuka's personality couldn't be like the weather right now. Looking up into the blue sky, he had to squint his eyes as the brightness of the sun seared his eyes. Well, he supposed that he was lucky that she had agreed to come along, considering what had happened earlier. He didn't think Asuka would ever forgive him, and Misato would certainly never let him forget about it.  
真嗣发出一声低沉的叹息，不禁疑惑为什么明日香的个性不能像现在的天气一样。他抬头望向蓝天，不得不眯起眼睛，因为阳光的亮度灼烧着他的双眼。嗯，他觉得能让她同意一起来已经很幸运了，考虑到之前发生的事情。他没想到明日香会原谅他，而美里肯定永远不会让他忘记这件事。

As usual, the clothes that Misato had given him was his usual dark black pants and white button up shirt. Shinji wasn't sure why, but he just didn't feel comfortable in anything else. Asuka on the other hand...  
一如既往，美里给他的衣服是他常穿的深黑色裤子和白色纽扣衬衫。真嗣不确定为什么，但他就是觉得穿其他衣服不自在。而明日香则不同……

Shinji glanced at her back as she continued walking briskly in front of him, which was strange considering she had absolutely no idea where they were going. Asuka was in a dark blue pair of jeans that...well, highlight her features particularly accurately, in Shinji's opinion. He supposed that Misato had purposefully chosen the pair. Surprisingly though, Asuka was not wearing her normal red shirt, in fact, she wasn't wearing anything red. (that Shinji could see at least) Misato instead, had given her a light blue t-shirt with the Nerv emblem on the back of it. Shinji was surprised by this...strange piece of clothing and it was clear to him that Asuka was not enjoying it in the least.  
真嗣瞥了一眼她的背影，她继续在他前面快步走着，考虑到她完全不知道他们要去哪里，这显得有些奇怪。明日香穿着一条深蓝色的牛仔裤……好吧，真嗣认为这特别准确地突显了她的特征。他猜想这是美里特意挑选的。不过令人惊讶的是，明日香没有穿她平常的红色衬衫，实际上，她没有穿任何红色的衣服（至少真嗣能看到的部分没有）。美里给了她一件浅蓝色的 T 恤，背后印有 NERV 的标志。真嗣对这件奇怪的衣服感到惊讶……显然，明日香一点也不喜欢它。

Suddenly being pulled away from his thoughts, he almost walked straight into Asuka who had stopped at an intersection.  
突然从思绪中被拉回现实，他差点直接撞上了在十字路口停下的明日香。

"Well, which way?" she attempted to ask politely, but instead came off rather snobbish.  
“那么，走哪边？”她试图礼貌地问，但听起来却相当傲慢。

"Oh...sorry," replied Shinji as he walked past her, getting a faint whiff of the usual flowery smell that seemed to radiate off her. If he had to stand next to her for too long, he was afraid he might pass out.  
"哦...对不起，" 真嗣回答着，从她身边走过，闻到了她身上那股熟悉的淡淡花香。如果他站得太近，他担心自己可能会晕倒。

"Its this way," said Shinji, recognizing a sign that was advertising for some new diet supplement.  
"这边走，" 真嗣说道，他认出了一个广告牌，正在宣传某种新的减肥补充品。

Turning the corner, Shinji walked in front with Asuka just trailing behind him. Due to there close proximity, (and the fact that Tokyo-3's sidewalks are rather narrow) their arms kept on bumping into each other to the point that Asuka got so fed up with it that she linked her left arm around Shinji's right arm.  
转过拐角，真嗣走在前面，明日香紧随其后。由于他们靠得很近（而且第三新东京市的人行道相当狭窄），他们的手臂不停地互相碰撞，以至于明日香对此感到非常厌烦，于是她用左手挽住了真嗣的右手臂。

"What are you doing?" asked Shinji the moment he noticed that she had not shunned away from the skin contact.  
"你在做什么？" 真嗣注意到她并没有避开皮肤接触，立刻问道。

"Forget about it and just keep walking," replied Asuka with a faint blush on her cheeks. "Or would you prefer I just drag you instead?"  
"别在意，继续走吧，" 明日香脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，回答道，"还是说，你更希望我直接拖着你走？"

"No, I wouldn't prefer that," said Shinji in a quiet voice.  
"不，我不希望那样，" 真嗣轻声说道。

"Good, then forget about it," said Asuka.  
“好，那就忘掉它吧。”明日香说道。

Shinji was slightly bemused at her decision; to any casual onlooker, they looked like a couple.  
对于她的决定，真嗣感到有些困惑；在外人看来，他们就像一对情侣。

---

Maybe half an hour later, Shinji finally stood where he had the day before: directly across the street from where he had met Rebecca yesterday. As they had sunk deeper and deeper into the slums of Tokyo-3, Asuka had started to get mildly curious about where Shinji was taking her.  
大约半小时后，真嗣终于站在了昨天他所在的位置：就在昨天遇到丽贝卡的街对面。随着他们越来越深入东京-3 的贫民区，明日香开始对真嗣带她去的地方产生了些许好奇。

"Thats it?" she asked while looking across the street at the small cafe.  
"就这样？" 她一边问，一边隔街望向那家小咖啡馆。

"Yep, thats it," replied Shinji.  
"是的，就这样，" 真嗣回答道。

"Looks like a dump." "看起来像个破地方。"

Shinji turned to look at her with a hurt look on his face, as though he had been insulted personally. Seeing the look on his face, Asuka hurriedly said, "Well it does...I mean...its not the sort of place I'd ever consider eating at. Besides," here she looked around at the abandoned buildings that littered most of the street, "I can't imagine they get much business."  
真嗣转头看向她，脸上带着受伤的表情，仿佛受到了个人侮辱。看到他的表情，明日香急忙说道：“好吧，它确实……我的意思是……这不是我会考虑用餐的地方。而且，”她环顾四周，街道上满是废弃的建筑物，“我无法想象他们能有多少生意。”

"C'mon," said Shinji slightly annoyed at her response.  
“拜托，”真嗣略带不悦地回应道。

Cupping his hand in her own, he started making his way across the street with her in tow.  
他用手掌托住她的手，带着她一起穿过街道。

He wasn't sure what he should expect as he opened the door to the cafe, though it looked as though nothing had changed. Everything was in the same place, including that terrible painting of the coffee cup behind the counter.  
当他推开咖啡馆的门时，他不确定自己该期待什么，尽管看起来一切如常。所有东西都还在原位，包括柜台后面那幅糟糕透顶的咖啡杯画。

As Shinji walked up to the counter, he was starting to wonder if Rebecca had not come in today, when she came out of the back room with a book in her hand. She looked much the same as yesterday, except that today she had her long, dark hair, tied back in a ponytail.  
当真嗣走向柜台时，他开始怀疑丽贝卡今天是否没来上班，这时她从后面的房间走出来，手里拿着一本书。她看起来和昨天差不多，只是今天她把那头乌黑的长发扎成了马尾。

No doubt because she had heard the chiming of the bell ringing above the door, she had come out of the back room, expecting to see Eein and his thugs wanting their cut of the day. What she didn't expect was to see Shinji standing precisely where he had been yesterday, when she had still thought he was a spoiled rotten child who had gotten into a fight with his parents.  
毫无疑问，因为她听到了门上铃铛的响声，她从后面的房间出来，以为会看到艾因和他的打手们来索要今天的分成。她没想到会看到真嗣站在昨天他站的地方，那时她还以为他是个被宠坏的孩子，和父母发生了争执。

She stood there for a second, rather stunned that he would appear before her so soon when his face broke into a smile, and ignoring the person a step behind him, she threw herself over the counter and brought him into a bone crunching hug.  
她站在那里愣了一会儿，没想到他会这么快出现在她面前，当他的脸绽放出笑容时，她无视了他身后的人，越过柜台，给了他一个紧紧的拥抱。

"Shinji!" she yelled both happy and surprised at his sudden appearance.  
“真嗣！”她又惊又喜地大喊，对他的突然出现感到意外。

Behind them, the corners of Asuka's eyes twitched slightly.  
在他们身后，明日香的眼角微微抽动了一下。

'What, first name basis already?' she thought suddenly feeling angry. Slowly her eyes trailed over the person who's name she did not know, comparing herself to her in the process. She didn't like what she saw. How old was this chick precisely, because she was a good four or five years older than Asuka herself. And then their was her...chest (Asuka refused to think of the other word) and the fact that it was pressed firmly against Shinji. The mere thought of this made Asuka feel like destroying every breakable object in sight. Looking down at her own features, she suddenly felt outclassed.  
‘什么，已经直呼其名了？’她突然感到一阵愤怒。慢慢地，她的目光扫过那个她连名字都不知道的人，同时暗自与对方比较。她不喜欢自己看到的。这个女人到底多大了，因为她明显比明日香大上四五岁。而且还有她的……胸部（明日香拒绝用其他词来称呼），以及它紧贴着真嗣的事实。光是想到这一点，明日香就有种想要摧毁眼前所有易碎物品的冲动。低头看着自己的身材，她突然觉得自己相形见绌。

Shinji may have sensed the cold fury that was slowly starting to emit off the angry girl behind him, because he quickly untangled himself from Rebecca's surprisingly strong grip and stood back from her.  
真嗣可能察觉到了身后那个愤怒女孩逐渐散发出的冷酷怒气，因为他迅速从丽贝卡出人意料的强力拥抱中挣脱出来，并退后了几步。

"I told you that I'd come by again," replied Shinji.  
“我说过我会再来的，”真嗣回答道。

"I know but...I didn't think it would be this soon. I hadn't really expected you till like...next week, or something."  
"我知道，但是...没想到会这么快。我原本以为你至少要到...下周，或者更晚些才来。"

"Are you going to introduce me or not?" asked Asuka feeling left out and extremely grumpy.  
""你到底要不要介绍我？"" 明日香感到被冷落，心情极度不爽地问道。

Rebecca, just noticing Asuka said, "You must be the girl I had heard about...Asuka right?"  
丽贝卡这才注意到明日香，说道：""你一定就是我听说过的那个女孩...明日香，对吧？""

Asuka raised an eyebrow and turned towards Shinji with her hands folded in front of her chest and said indignantly, "How is it that she knows about me but I have absolutely no idea who she is, and furthermore, what have you been saying about me?"  
明日香挑了挑眉，双手交叉在胸前转向真嗣，不满地说道：“她怎么知道我的事，而我却对她一无所知，还有，你到底都说了我些什么？”

"I had intended to keep it a surprise," mumbled Shinji almost inaudible.  
“我本想保持神秘的，”真嗣几乎听不清地咕哝道。

"Big surprise that you failed," said Asuka sarcastically.  
“你失败了，真是大惊喜啊，”明日香讽刺地说。

As Rebecca looked from Shinji to Asuka her impression was grossly different than what she had expected when Shinji had briefly mentioned Asuka last time.  
当丽贝卡从真嗣看到明日香时，她的印象与上次真嗣简短提到明日香时所预期的截然不同。

"I'm sorry, but you caught me by surprise, so I'm not really sure what I'll be able to make-"  
“对不起，但你让我有些措手不及，所以我也不确定能做出什么来——”

"Don't worry about it," said Shinji hurriedly, "two Cola's will be fine for now."  
“别担心，”真嗣急忙说道，“两杯可乐现在就挺好。”

Beaming at him, Rebecca hurriedly retreated in the back room for glasses that she normally kept on hand for people she personally knew, leaving Shinji and Asuka to find a seat. Needless to say, the tension in the air was so strong you would have difficulties cutting it with a knife.  
对着他灿烂一笑，丽贝卡急忙退到后屋去拿她通常为熟人准备的杯子，留下真嗣和明日香找座位。不用说，空气中的紧张气氛浓烈到仿佛用刀都难以割开。

Finding a seat by the window, Shinji and Asuka sat down across from each other, with Shinji lounging back in his chair, while Asuka crossed her legs and planted her chin in the palm of her hands in clear irritation.  
找到靠窗的座位，真嗣和明日香面对面坐下，真嗣懒洋洋地靠在椅背上，而明日香则翘起腿，手掌托着下巴，明显带着不悦。

After several seconds of this, Shinji finally spoke up.  
这样过了几秒钟后，真嗣终于开口了。

"Is something wrong?" "有什么不对劲吗？"

"Not at all," replied Asuka, making it quite clear that something was definitely wrong.  
"一点也不，" 明日香回答道，显然表明有什么事情不对劲。

"But you seem...angry at something. Is it still because of earlier...I mean, I meant what I said, about you being cu-"  
"但你看起来...对某件事很生气。还是因为早些时候的事吗...我是说，我说的那些话是真心的，关于你很可——"

"It has nothing to do with that," said Asuka tensely, still remembering the unfortunate events of earlier."  
"那与此无关，" 明日香紧张地说，仍然记得早些时候的不幸事件。

"Then what is it-" "那它是什么-"

"Figure it out yourself," she snapped back at him.  
"自己想吧，" 她厉声回敬他。

Shinji winced at the tone in her voice and gaped back at her, confused at her sudden coldness towards him. Closing his mouth, he suddenly felt irritated in turn, and turned his head towards the window, determined not to look at her face...which he'd been sneaking glances at most of the way since they left Nerv.  
真嗣被她的语气吓了一跳，困惑地回望着她，不解她为何突然对他如此冷淡。他闭上嘴，突然也感到一阵烦躁，于是转头望向窗外，决心不再看她的脸...自从离开 NERV 后，他大部分时间都在偷偷瞥她。

As Rebecca came out of the back room, she immediately could tell that something had happened between the two, considering that she didn't hear any talking. She had assumed that they were at least very good friends, if not dating, but she was rather surprised at the coldness they were showing towards each other.  
当丽贝卡从后面的房间走出来时，她立刻感觉到两人之间发生了什么，考虑到她没有听到任何交谈。她本以为他们至少是非常好的朋友，如果不是在交往的话，但她对彼此间展现出的冷漠感到相当惊讶。

Walking up to the table they were seated at, Shinji put both glasses down on the table and asked, "Is anything wrong?"  
走到他们坐的桌子旁，真嗣将两个杯子放在桌上，问道：“有什么不对劲吗？”

"Not at all," replied Shinji and Asuka at the same time.  
“一点也没有，”真嗣和明日香异口同声地回答。

Rather taken aback, Rebecca was forced to bight down on her tongue to express her opinion at how stupid they were being. If she had had somebody special in her life, as both Shinji and Asuka did...well, she'd like to hope her life would have turned out differently.  
Rebecca 感到相当意外，不得不咬住舌头，以免表达出对他们愚蠢行为的看法。如果她生命中也有一个特别的人，就像真嗣和明日香那样...嗯，她希望自己的生活会有所不同。

Grabbing a chair from a nearby table, she spun it around and planted it on the ground, so that she sat next to both Shinji and Asuka. Sitting down on it with the back of the chair in the opposite direction, she spread her hands across the cool plastic, and rested her chin in her hands.  
她从附近的一张桌子上抓起一把椅子，转了一圈，然后把它放在地上，这样她就可以坐在真嗣和明日香旁边。她坐在椅子上，椅背朝相反方向，双手摊开在冰凉的塑料上，下巴靠在手上。

After several seconds of silence from both of the stubborn teenagers, Rebecca threw caution to the winds and dived into conversation with Shinji.  
在两个固执的青少年沉默了几秒钟后，Rebecca 不顾一切地开始与真嗣交谈。

"Are you going to tell me what you were doing yesterday? I've heard plenty of rumors by now...but I'd prefer to hear it from your own mouth."  
"你打算告诉我昨天你在做什么吗？我现在已经听到了不少传言...但我更愿意听你亲口说。"

It took Shinji a second or so to remember what she was talking about, during which Asuka shifted her gaze away from the window and stared at Rebecca out of the corner of her eye. Why was she loathing this chick more and more by the second?  
真嗣花了大约一秒钟的时间才想起她在说什么，在这期间，明日香将目光从窗外移开，用眼角瞥着丽贝卡。为什么她越来越讨厌这个女孩了？

"Oh that...right," said Shinji, finally remembering his promise to her yesterday.  
"哦，那个...对了，"真嗣终于想起了昨天对她的承诺。"

"So are you going to...you did promise."  
“所以你打算……你确实答应过。”

A vein pulsated in Asuka's forehead. 'So he promised _her_ something too?' she thought spitefully.  
明日香额头上的青筋跳动着。‘所以他答应了她什么？’她恶意地想。

Shinji hesitated for a second before saying, "What exactly have you heard?"  
真嗣犹豫了一会儿，才问道：“你到底听说了些什么？”

"A lot really, though I've no idea how much is true. From what I've gathered, you are involved with some organization called Nerv, which has some surface dealings, but what its really done has always been kept hidden in the shadows. You hear a lot of strange stuff in this part of town. Anyways, it seems that something has been attacking Tokyo-3 and thats why the shelters have been opening so often recently. I heard that many times, people had tried to get footage of these things...but every time they did the JSDF would silence them and destroy the footage. I'm guessing that you, in some way, have helped to defeat these things."  
"确实很多，虽然我不确定哪些是真的。据我所知，你似乎与一个名为 Nerv 的组织有关，该组织表面上有一些交易，但其真正所为始终隐藏在暗处。在这个街区，你会听到很多奇怪的事情。不管怎样，似乎有什么东西一直在攻击东京-3，这就是为什么避难所最近频繁开放的原因。我听说很多人试图拍摄这些东西的画面...但每次他们这么做，自卫队就会封锁消息并销毁录像。我猜你以某种方式帮助击败了这些东西。"

Shinji was rather surprised at how close she was to the point, she just didn't know the finer details. It reaffirmed what he had thought before of her having strong critical thinking skills.  
对于她接近真相的程度，真嗣感到相当惊讶，她只是不知道更详细的细节。这再次证实了他之前对她拥有强大批判性思维能力的看法。

"And I'm guessing that you fit into this somehow Asuka," Rebecca said, turning towards her, "because you're an employee of Nerv also."  
"我猜你也与此有关，明日香，" 丽贝卡转向她说，"因为你也是 Nerv 的员工。"

Asuka narrowed her eyes and asked, "How do you figure that?"  
明日香眯起眼睛问道：“你怎么得出这个结论的？”

"Because Shinji used some card with your picture on it to buy a sandwich here before, so I'm guessing that you also work with Nerv."  
“因为真嗣之前用了一张印有你照片的卡片在这里买过三明治，所以我猜你也和 NERV 有关。”

Asuka blinked several times to show her surprise at Rebecca's deductive reasoning. Though she had not heard anything about Shinji buying with her security card that she had lent him. Turning towards him she mouthed, 'What is this about you buying stuff before?'  
明日香眨了几次眼，对丽贝卡的推理能力表示惊讶。虽然她从未听说过真嗣用她借给他的安全卡买东西的事。她转向他，无声地问：‘你之前买东西是怎么回事？’

Shinji shrugged as though it didn't matter right now and turned back to Rebecca. Asuka was extremely annoyed at his obvious disinterest in herself and turned back to facing the window, determined to block out the conversation next to her.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，仿佛现在这并不重要，然后转身面向丽贝卡。明日香对他明显的漠不关心感到极度恼火，转而面对窗户，决心屏蔽掉旁边的那场对话。

"Well...I know I had said I would tell you everything later...but really its not something the general public should know about," said Shinji meekly.  
“嗯……我知道我之前说过稍后会告诉你一切……但真的，这不是公众应该知道的事情。”真嗣怯生生地说。

"Can I really be considered part of the general public considering I've met both of you, and I know that you had something to do with what happened yesterday?" said Rebecca stubbornly.  
“考虑到我已经见过你们两个，并且我知道你们与昨天发生的事情有关，我还能被视为普通公众吗？”丽贝卡固执地说。

"A little help Asuka?" said Shinji, turning towards her.  
"能帮我一下吗，明日香？" 真嗣转向她说道。

"...Oh? So now you want to talk to me?"  
"...哦？现在你想跟我说话了？"

"...Whats up with you today? Ever since we got here you've been rather-"  
"...你今天怎么了？自从我们到这里以来，你就一直有点——"

"I don't care whether she knows what we do or not, but leave me out of it," replied Asuka sourly.  
"我不在乎她是否知道我们做的事，但别把我扯进去，" 明日香酸溜溜地回答。

Shinji waited a second longer, hoping that Asuka would change her mind. When she didn't, Shinji let out a low sigh and said to Rebecca, "Fine, I'll tell you."  
真嗣又等了一会儿，希望明日香能改变主意。见她没有，真嗣轻叹一声，对丽贝卡说："好吧，我告诉你。"

"Good," said Rebecca. "很好，" 丽贝卡说。

Standing up, she spun the chair around again, this time so that her back could rest against the back of the chair. If she was going to hear what Shinji was going to say, she may as well be comfortable.  
她站起身，再次旋转椅子，这次让椅背靠在自己的背上。如果她要听真嗣要说的话，不妨让自己舒服些。

Folding her arms in front of her chest, she crossed her legs in a way that Shinji was reminded briefly of Asuka. Pushing the thought to the side before it could take a firm hold in his mind, he opened his mouth and said, "I suppose that I should first tell you what the Evangelions are."  
她双臂交叉在胸前，双腿交叠，让真嗣短暂地想起了明日香。他赶在那个念头扎根之前将其推开，张口说道：“我想我应该先告诉你什么是 EVA。”

Rebecca blinked and asked, "Evangel...what?"  
丽贝卡眨了眨眼，问道：“EVA...什么？”

"I don't really know myself," said Shinji, "but they are giant robot-no...thats not quite right I suppose. They have flesh and blood so its closer to call them a cyborg I guess."  
"我其实不太了解自己，" 真嗣说道，"但它们不是巨型机器人...这么说不太准确。它们有血有肉，所以更接近于称呼它们为赛博格吧。"

"So they are humanoid?" "那么它们是人形的？"

"...I suppose its the closest you could call them. Anyways...we pilot these things called Evangelions."  
"...我想这是最接近的称呼了。总之...我们驾驶这些被称为 EVA 的东西。"

"We?"

"Me, Asuka, and another named Ayanami Rei."  
"我，明日香，还有另一个叫绫波零。"

"Why though?" "为什么呢？"

"...Well, there are these...things called angels...why we call them that I'm not really sure. They attack here because of Lil-some reason." Shinji caught himself before he had let slip about Lilith. Even Asuka didn't know about the fact that an angel was buried beneath Nerv, and Shinji didn't think it wise for her to know.  
"...嗯，有这些...东西叫做使徒...我们为什么这么称呼它们，我也不太确定。它们攻击这里是因为某种原因...关于莉莉丝的事，我差点说漏嘴了。即使明日香也不知道使徒埋在 NERV 下面的事实，我觉得她还是不知道为好。"

Changing the subject, he said, "You know what Second Impact is of course."  
他转移话题，说道：“你知道第二次冲击是什么，当然。”

"Yeah, thats when a meteor hit the South Pole and turned much of the ocean red, killing off marine life."  
“嗯，那是一颗陨石撞击南极，导致大量海水变红，海洋生物大量死亡的事件。”

"Its not true," said Shinji bluntly.  
“那不是真的，”真嗣直截了当地说。

"What! What do you mean not true!"  
"什么！你说的不是真的吧！"

"Thats just something that world governments have fed to the general population. In truth, Second Impact initiated because of a science experiment that involved contact with an angel. The experiment...went wrong and the angel went on a rampage, destroying the scientists there and laboratories. What the angels are trying to do now is something similar. They want to start Third Impact, and recreate a new Earth without any harm from human beings, or at least, thats what I've been told."  
"那只是世界各国政府向大众灌输的说法。实际上，第二次冲击是因为一项涉及与天使接触的科学实验引发的。实验...出了差错，天使暴走，摧毁了那里的科学家和实验室。现在天使们想要做的，是类似的事情。他们想要启动第三次冲击，重建一个没有人类伤害的新地球，至少我是这么被告知的。"

"So then you...defeat these angels with the...Eva thingy's?"  
"那么你...是用...Eva 机体来击败这些天使的吗？"

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

"But why you...why Asuka?"  
"但为什么是你...为什么是明日香？"

"...It has something to do with children born after Second Impact...brain waves I think."  
"...这与第二次冲击后出生的孩子有关...我想是脑波。"

"So then I couldn't help could I," mumbled Rebecca, more to herself than to Shinji.  
"这么说我就帮不上忙了，对吧，" 丽贝卡喃喃自语，与其说是对真嗣说，不如说是自言自语。"

"Why? Were you born before Second Impact?"  
"为什么？你是在第二次冲击前出生的吗？"

"Yeah, just four months before it happened."  
"是啊，就在那之前四个月。"

"You should be thankful that you don't have to. Piloting them is a rather...gruesome experience."  
"你应该庆幸你不必经历。驾驶它们是一种相当...残酷的体验。"

"You sound bitter..." "你听起来很苦涩……"

"...I suppose I am. Our lives are changed because of the Evangelions so much that normal living is not possible...even if this all ends. We are always having to do tests with our Evangelions."  
"……我想我是的。因为 EVA，我们的生活发生了太多改变，以至于正常生活变得不可能……即使这一切结束。我们总是不得不与我们的 EVA 进行测试。"

"Do you have your own?"  
"你有你自己的吗？"

"Yeah, we each have our own that is uniquely for us. None of the others can pilot mine, and I can't piloting any of the others."  
“是的，我们每个人都有属于自己的，独一无二的。其他人无法驾驶我的，我也无法驾驶其他的。”

"...Then what happened yesterday, when you seemed to faint?"  
“……那昨天是怎么回事，你好像昏倒了？”

Asuka perked up slightly at her question and turned her head a fraction of an inch towards Shinji.  
听到她的问题，明日香微微振作了一些，将头转向真嗣，偏了不到一英寸。

Caught off guard momentarily, Shinji hesitating before saying, "That was...something different...not really important."  
一时措手不及，真嗣犹豫了一下才说："那是个...与众不同的经历...其实不太重要。"

Attempting to change the subject, Shinji instead asked, "But what about you?"  
试图转移话题，真嗣反而问道："那你呢？"

"What about me?" “我怎么了？”

"Have you seen Eein at all since yesterday?"  
"你昨天之后见过 Eein 吗？"

"No of course not. I had momentarily thought it was him when you two came in so I was rather hesitant to come out of the back. I'm not sure what he'll do considering what you did yesterday."  
"当然没有。当你们俩进来时，我一时以为是他，所以相当犹豫要不要从后面出来。考虑到你昨天做的事，我不确定他会怎么做。"

"And what exactly did Shinji do yesterday," asked Asuka suddenly speaking up, still staring blankly at the window.  
"那么，Shinji 昨天到底做了什么？" Asuka 突然开口问道，仍然茫然地盯着窗户。

Rebecca and Shinji both looked at each other here. Shinji shrugged his shoulders, meaning that if Rebecca wanted to she could tell Asuka what had happened. She would ask him later about it anyway, if she didn't get an answer now.  
丽贝卡和真嗣在这里互相看了一眼。真嗣耸了耸肩，意思是如果丽贝卡愿意，她可以告诉明日香发生了什么。反正如果她现在得不到答案，稍后也会问他。

"Well," Rebecca started, "Shinji came in looking sorta lost and ordered a Cola and two sandwich's. I wasn't having a very good day so I was rather...pissed at him I suppose without really meaning to. I remember he asked me what I was reading and we talked shortly then...just small talk. Then Eein and Gonzo came in and-"  
"嗯，"丽贝卡开始说道，"真嗣进来时看起来有点迷茫，点了一杯可乐和两份三明治。我那天过得不太好，所以可能有点...对他生气了，虽然并不是故意的。我记得他问我正在读什么书，我们简短地聊了几句...只是闲聊。然后伊恩和冈佐进来了..."

"And who are these two?" asked Asuka.  
"这两位是谁？"明日香问道。

"...You could call them something of my bosses I guess, though not in the normal sense. Eein considers me his property."  
"...你可以称他们为我的某种上司吧，虽然不是通常意义上的那种。Eein 认为我是他的财产。"

"So what...you're like his bitch or something?"  
"那...你就像是他的跟班之类的？"

"Asuka!" retorted Shinji angrily.  
""Asuka！"" 真嗣生气地反驳道。

"No its fine, she technically is right," said Rebecca. "My mom has a condition and I basically work for Eein to help pay off the debt I owe him. He comes in usually once a day and collects any money that I earned that day."  
"不，没事，她实际上说得没错，" 丽贝卡说道。"我妈妈有病，我基本上是为 Eein 工作，帮他偿还我欠他的债务。他通常每天来一次，收取我当天赚的钱。"

"That sucks," said Asuka, idly twirling a lock of her hair between her fingers.  
"那真糟糕，" 明日香说着，无聊地用手指卷着一缕头发。"

"Yes it does, but I love my mom too much to give up on her. Anyways, Eein and Gonzo come in and like usual ask me whether I got any money, because they only care about cash. Shinji of course used your card and Eein got mad and started threatening me like he does sometimes. He wasn't in a very good mood that day either and, well, wanted me to pleasure him."  
"确实如此，但我太爱我妈妈了，无法放弃她。总之，Eein 和 Gonzo 进来，像往常一样问我有没有钱，因为他们只关心现金。真嗣当然用了你的卡，Eein 就生气了，开始像平时那样威胁我。那天他的心情本来就不好，嗯，还想让我取悦他。"

"Like what...sex?" "像什么...性吗？"

"Err, not quite, he never went that far, but he'd always want me to do...other stuff for him, though it usually never came to it."  
"呃，不完全是，他从未做到那一步，但他总是想让我为他做...其他的事情，虽然通常都没发生。"

Asuka couldn't help but shiver at the way Rebecca had said usually. She was reminded briefly of her own experience with a sex offender.  
听到丽贝卡说“通常”这个词的方式，明日香不禁打了个寒颤。她短暂地想起了自己与性侵犯的经历。

"At this point Shinji got...mad I guess."  
“这时候，真嗣变得……我想是生气了吧。”

'And with good reason,' thought Asuka.  
“而且是有充分理由的，”明日香心想。

"But he...I don't really know how to explain it...he threatened them I think."  
“但他……我真的不知道该怎么解释……我觉得他威胁了他们。”

Asuka's eyebrows soared into her bangs. "What? He threatened them?"  
明日香的眉毛高高扬起，几乎碰到了刘海。“什么？他威胁他们了？”

"I think...they backed off, but I remember that the air felt...hostile. It wasn't directed at me, but I still remember how Eein's henchmen looked...they were scared, really scared, as though Shinji could have killed them if he had wanted to."  
“我觉得……他们退缩了，但我记得那种气氛……充满了敌意。虽然不是针对我，但我仍然记得伊恩的手下们看起来……他们很害怕，真的很害怕，仿佛真嗣如果想的话，就能杀了他们。”

Throughout this story, Shinji was calmly looking out the window, as though he didn't care how it ended.  
在整个故事中，真嗣平静地望着窗外，仿佛他并不在乎结局如何。

"But they left and Shinji seemed to relax...I felt terrible at that point, because he had to see something like that, and because I think they _would_ have done something if he wasn't there."  
但他们离开后，真嗣似乎放松了...我当时感到很难过，因为他不得不目睹那样的事情，而且我觉得如果他不在场，他们可能会做出些什么。

Asuka's mouth was slightly agape as Rebecca finished telling her story. Closing it with a snap, she fiercely turned towards Shinji and snarled, "What did you do!"  
当丽贝卡讲完她的故事时，明日香的嘴巴微微张开。她猛地合上嘴，转向真嗣，厉声喝道：“你做了什么！”

It took Shinji a few seconds to shift his gaze away from the window, but when he did, he looked into Asuka's clear blue eyes.  
真嗣花了好几秒才将目光从窗外移开，但当他这么做时，他看向了明日香清澈的蓝眼睛。

Repeating herself again, Asuka said, "What did you do!"  
又一次重复自己的话，明日香喊道：“你做了什么！”

"Nothing," replied Shinji calmly.  
“什么也没做，”真嗣平静地回答。

"Shinji if you...if you-"  
“真嗣，如果你……如果你——”

"I didn't...not again...I don't want to."  
"我并没有...不要再...我不想那样。"

Relief seemed to wash over Asuka's face and if Rebecca hadn't been there she probably would have hugged him. She was afraid that he might have used his AT-field, even with the way Rebecca had described everything. She couldn't stand it if he was taken away again for more experiments. She'd probably go insane.  
解脱的神情似乎在明日香的脸上一闪而过，如果不是丽贝卡在场，她大概已经拥抱了他。她担心他可能会使用他的 AT 力场，尽管丽贝卡已经描述了一切。如果他再次被带走进行更多实验，她无法忍受。她可能会发疯。

Propping her head up with the palm of her hand, she suddenly became thirsty, and gulped a large amount of the Cola down.  
她用手掌托着头，突然感到口渴，大口喝下了可乐。

Shinji who had remained tensed while telling Asuka he had no intention of using his AT-field on another human again, suddenly relaxed and grabbed his own glass of Cola, intending on draining it.  
在告诉明日香他无意再对另一个人类使用 AT 力场后，一直紧绷着的真嗣突然放松下来，抓起自己的那杯可乐，打算一口气喝干。

As Rebecca looked from both Shinji to Asuka and back again, she finally asked what she had been wondering for a while now.  
当丽贝卡来回看着真嗣和明日香时，她终于问出了自己已经疑惑了一段时间的问题。

"Um...I've been wondering about this but...but are you guys like...dating?"  
“呃……我一直想问这个，但是……你们是不是在……约会？”

Cola spewed forth from Shinji's nostrils at her question, spewing snot and sugar water across the table. Likewise, across the table, something similar had happened to Asuka. She had swallowed a large gulp of Cola as Rebecca had asked her question, sending some of the Cola down her Trachea instead of her Esophagus, causing her to cough violently.  
可乐从真嗣的鼻孔中喷涌而出，带着鼻涕和糖水溅满了桌面。同样，对面的明日香也遭遇了类似的情况。她在丽贝卡提问时猛灌了一大口可乐，结果部分可乐误入了气管而非食道，导致她剧烈地咳嗽起来。

Seeing that she had obviously asked the wrong question, Rebecca quickly said, "Sorry, I just thought that you were, since you seemed to get along so well."  
意识到自己显然问错了问题，丽贝卡迅速道歉：“对不起，我只是觉得你们既然相处得这么好……”

"What? With this idiot?" said Asuka in between coughing.  
“什么？和这个白痴？”明日香在咳嗽间歇说道。

"Sorry," repeated Rebecca, "but it seemed like you could have been...so I asked."  
"对不起，" 丽贝卡重复道，"但看起来你本可以……所以我就问了。"

"Not a chance...never in a million years," said Asuka stubbornly.  
"绝不可能……一百万年也不会，" 明日香固执地说。"

"I don't think I could have survived this long if we were dating," said Shinji, wincing at the feel of his nose.  
"我想如果我们真的在交往，我可能撑不了这么久，" 真嗣说着，皱眉感受着鼻子的疼痛。"

A nerve twitched in Asuka and she was suddenly grabbing Shinji across the table and yelled, "You don't think you'd be alive if we were dating!"  
明日香神经一跳，突然隔着桌子抓住了真嗣，大喊道：“你以为如果我们交往的话，你还能活着吗！”

"If this right here is any indication...no, probably not."  
“如果现在这种情况能说明什么的话……不，大概不能。”

Asuka's eyebrow twitched slightly, but she let go of Shinji shirt and sat back down.  
明日香的眉毛微微一挑，但她松开了真嗣的衬衫，重新坐了下来。

"Hmph, your probably right, we can't even get along properly anyway."  
"哼，你大概是对的，我们反正也相处不好。"

Rebecca looked from Shinji to Asuka, wondering how both of them could be so stupid when there was obviously a connection between them.  
丽贝卡从真嗣看到明日香，纳闷他们俩怎么能在明显有联系的情况下还这么愚蠢。

"I still need to go shopping," said Asuka suddenly.  
"我还需要去买东西，"明日香突然说道。"

"What do you mean still? I thought you decided you didn't want to-"  
"你说的'还是'是什么意思？我以为你决定不想要——"

"I changed my mind, I've got a few things that I need to get. Besides, its not as though I need you with me or anything. So you can stay here and keep chatting for all I care."  
"我改变主意了，我有些东西需要买。再说了，我并不需要你陪我一起去。所以你可以留在这里继续聊天，我无所谓。"

"...Then you know how to get back without me?"  
"...那你应该知道怎么回来，不需要我带路吧？"

"Of course," said Asuka stubbornly.  
“当然，”明日香固执地说。

"Okay then...I guess I'll hang out for a while longer with Rebecca. Do you want to meet somewhere or-"  
“那好吧……我想我会再和丽贝卡待一会儿。你想在哪儿见面还是——”

Shinji cut himself off when he saw the hurt expression on Asuka's face. Seriously...what had he done to anger her in such a way?  
看到明日香脸上的受伤表情，真嗣话说到一半就停住了。说真的……他到底做了什么让她这么生气？

"Asuka wha-" "明日香，什——"

"Forget it," she snapped back at him.  
"别提了，"她厉声回敬他。

Standing up promptly, she spun around, her hair whipping across her face, and walked out of the cafe without another word.  
她迅速站起身，猛地转过头，头发甩过脸颊，一言不发地走出了咖啡馆。

Shinji meanwhile, was left sitting in his seat, wondering how the hell everything had turned so shitty in the last few minutes.  
与此同时，真嗣坐在座位上，纳闷着怎么在过去的几分钟里一切都变得如此糟糕。

"What exactly just happened?" he asked to no one in particular.  
“刚才到底发生了什么？”他自言自语道。

Rebecca was silent as she stood up and grabbed what remained of Shinji and Asuka's glasses. Walking around the side of the counter, she dropped them into the dishwasher built into the wooden surface next to the sink.  
丽贝卡默默地站起身，拿起新志和明日香破碎的眼镜。她绕过柜台，将它们丢进了水槽旁嵌入式木质台面的洗碗机里。

Turning around, she saw that Shinji had budged an inch since Asuka left, nor gave any sign that he intended to go after. It was this, more than anything else, that made her voice her opinion.  
转过身来，她发现新志自从明日香离开后一动未动，也没有任何迹象表明他会追上去。正是这一点，比其他任何事情都更让她忍不住发表了意见。

"You really should go after her."  
“你真的应该去追她。”

Turning towards her, Shinji asked, "Why? She obviously doesn't care whether I'm there or not."  
转向她，真嗣问道：“为什么？她显然不在乎我是否在那里。”

Rebecca let out an audible sigh and walked back around the counter. Sitting back down in the chair she had recently vacated, she said to Shinji, "I know that you've never been good with other people Shinji, but can't you see that what she said isn't what she really wanted."  
丽贝卡发出一声明显的叹息，绕回柜台。重新坐回她刚刚离开的椅子，她对真嗣说：“我知道你一直不擅长与人相处，真嗣，但你难道看不出她说的并不是她真正想要的吗。”

"I hardly ever know whats true when it comes out of her mouth. I don't even know why she's been so angry ever since I got here-"  
"我几乎从来不知道她嘴里说出来的哪些是真的。我甚至不知道为什么她自从我来了之后就一直这么生气-"

"For God's sake Shinji, she was jealous!"  
"看在上帝的份上，真嗣，她是嫉妒了！"

It took her words a few seconds to sink into Shinji's mind, but when they did-  
她的这些话花了好几秒钟才渗入真嗣的脑海，但当它们真的渗入时-

"You've gotta be kidding me," said Shinji, trying his best not to laugh. "Asuka...jealous? Why?"  
"你一定是在开玩笑吧，" 真嗣尽力不让自己笑出声来。"明日香...嫉妒？为什么？"

"Why? Because of me obviously!"  
"为什么？当然是因为我啦！"

"You? But still why?" "你？但究竟是为什么呢？"

"Shinji what do you think me?"  
"真嗣，你觉得我怎么样？"

"What do I think of you?"  
"你觉得我怎么样？"

"Do you like me?" "你喜欢我吗？"

"...Well yeah..." "...嗯，是啊..."

"Then do you love me?"  
"那你爱我吗？"

Shinji didn't even have to think of that.  
真嗣甚至不需要思考这个问题。

"No, I don't." "不，我没有。"

"How did Asuka view our relationship?"  
"明日香是怎么看待我们的关系的？"

"...How am I supposed to know?"  
"...我怎么会知道？"

"Exactly, you can't know. She may have thought that you loved me or something. I can't imagine that she's had to contend with other females before anyway. She saw me as a...nuisance, in case you didn't realize it, nor did she like how easy it was for us to talk to each other, as though we'd known each other for a long time."  
"确实，你无法知道。她可能以为你爱我之类的。我无法想象她以前还得应付其他女性。她把我视为一个...麻烦，如果你没意识到的话，她也不喜欢我们之间交流如此轻松，仿佛我们已经认识很久了。"

"Still thats-" "尽管如此，那还是——"

"_Thats_ how girls think. She saw me as an obstacle, and the fact that I'm more mature and older didn't help her view of me. Shinji, let me ask you a question...how many girls do you know?"  
"女孩子就是这么想的。她把我看作障碍，而我更成熟、年纪更大这一事实也没有改善她对我的看法。真嗣，让我问你一个问题...你认识多少女孩？"

Shinji was rather taken aback at the question but was about to count off on his fingers when she changed the question.  
真嗣对这个问题的反应相当惊讶，正准备用手指计算时，她却改变了问题。

"That are your age." “和你同龄的。”

"Um...there's Asuka of course...Ayanami...and Hikari I suppose, though I don't know the later very well."  
“嗯……当然有明日香……绫波……还有大概是光吧，虽然我不太了解她。”

"So Asuka has never had anybody to serious contend with from the sounds of things."  
"听起来，绫波从未遇到过真正能与之较量的对手。"

"I'm still confused...Asuka doesn't really...I mean...jealous? Thats not really her."  
"我还是有点糊涂...绫波她不怎么...我是说...嫉妒？那不太像她。"

"Its not surprising for her age...jealousy is fairly common."  
"对她这个年纪来说，这并不奇怪...嫉妒其实挺常见的。"

"But why...wouldn't she have to...like me...or-"  
"但为什么...她不需要...喜欢我...或者-"

"Can't you see that she does!"  
"你难道看不出来她确实喜欢你吗！"

"She has an odd way of showing it," retorted Shinji.  
"她表达感情的方式很奇怪，" 真嗣反驳道。

"But she does still." "但她确实还在。"

"I think you're making things more complicated than they are."  
"我觉得你把事情搞得比实际更复杂。"

"And your stubbornly dumbing them down to your level of social expertise."  
"而你则固执地将它们简化到你那点社交水平。"

That one hurt, and Shinji could feel it.  
那一击真的很痛，真嗣能感觉到。

"Sorry," said Rebecca hurriedly, "but it bothers me how stubborn both of you were. I feel that...if maybe I had somebody in my life that I could have trusted and cared for...well maybe things would have turned out a bit different." She said this while gesturing around at her current environment.  
“对不起，”丽贝卡急忙说道，“但你们俩的固执让我很困扰。我觉得……如果我生命中有一个可以信任和关心的人……也许事情会有所不同。”她一边说一边环顾四周，示意她现在的环境。

"Look," she continued, "I can see that not only you, but she too has stuff buried deep that she doesn't want to talk about. Maybe you've heard some of it, maybe not, I don't want to know. Point is, is that you both have something to lean on when you're hurt or troubled. Accept it...for there may come a time when it is no longer there, and you will start to long for it."  
“听着，”她继续说，“我看得出，不仅是你，她也有深深埋藏、不愿提及的事情。也许你听说过一些，也许没有，我不想知道。关键是，当你们受伤或烦恼时，你们都有可以依靠的东西。接受它……因为总有一天它可能不再存在，而你会开始渴望它。”

Shinji was silent for a while as he churned everything over in his head.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，脑海中翻来覆去地思考着一切。

"So? What are you going to do?" asked Rebecca as she placed her hands on her hips.  
“所以呢？你打算怎么办？”丽贝卡双手叉腰问道。

Wordlessly Shinji stood up and muttered a brief thanks before hurrying out the door.  
真嗣一言不发地站起身，低声道了句谢，便匆匆离开了房间。

Rebecca stood still for a moment or so, and watched as Shinji started running in the direction where he hoped Asuka would be.  
丽贝卡静静地站了一会儿，看着真嗣开始朝着他希望找到明日香的方向跑去。

"If they don't end of together, I swear I'll make them both sit through counseling, even if I have to do it myself."  
“如果他们最后没在一起，我发誓我会让他们俩都接受心理辅导，哪怕得我自己动手。”

---

Shinji didn't have to go very far until he saw Asuka leaning against a brick building with glass window panes.  
真嗣没走多远就看到了明日香靠在一栋有玻璃窗格的砖墙建筑上。

Skidding to a halt, he bent over with his hands placed on his knees and started breathing laboriously.  
猛地刹住脚步，他双手撑着膝盖，开始吃力地喘息。

"So you came back," said Asuka as though he was a disobedient dog who had just returned to its master.  
“所以你回来了，”明日香说道，仿佛他是一只刚回到主人身边的顽皮狗。

"Yeah...I...Did..." “是啊...我...回来了...”

"And why is that?" Asuka asked with a snarl, "didn't I say that I didn't care whether you were with me or no-"  
"那又是为什么？" 明日香咆哮着问道，"我不是说过我不在乎你是否和我在一起吗——"

"But I want to be with you!" Shinji shouted out into the open air.  
"但我想要和你在一起！" 真嗣对着空旷的空气大声喊道。

Asuka literally turned into a frozen statue at his words and if Shinji had known, a pleasant shiver started at the top of her spine, and made its way down her back.  
明日香听到他的话后，整个人仿佛变成了一个冰雕，如果真嗣知道的话，她脊椎顶端开始涌起一阵愉悦的颤栗，并沿着背部蔓延开来。

"What did you say?" she managed to whisper.  
"你说什么？" 她勉强低声问道。

"I-I don't know...it just doesn't feel...right, if we aren't together. So I want to be with you."  
"我...我不知道...只是如果我们不在一起，感觉就不对劲。所以我想和你在一起。"

"And what about Rebecca huh? Do you want to be with her also?"  
"那丽贝卡呢？你也想和她在一起吗？"

"Asuka its not like that with her...it never was."  
"明日香，她不是那样的...从来都不是。"

"Then what is it hmmm?"  
"那又是什么呢，嗯？"

"She's like...she's like an older sister to me."  
"她就像...她就像我的姐姐一样。"

Asuka blinked back at him, surprised at his choice of words.  
明日香眨眼回望他，对他的措辞感到惊讶。

"She's like a sister to you?"  
“她对你来说就像个姐姐？”

"Yeah, somebody who's older than me, who knows more than I do and somebody I can ask for help or advice when...something I don't know is bothering me."  
“是啊，一个比我年长、懂得比我多的人，当我遇到不懂的事情困扰时，可以向她寻求帮助或建议。”

"I don't believe you!" "我不相信你！"

"Asuka...are you jealous."  
"明日香...你是在嫉妒吗。"

"Jealous...me? As if!" "嫉妒...我？怎么可能！"

'Then why did you feel so angry whenever Shinji and that girl were talking to each other,' asked a voice in her mind.  
'那你为什么每次真嗣和那个女孩说话时都那么生气呢，'她脑海中有个声音问道。

'Shut Up!' she shouted back.  
“闭嘴！”她回喊道。

"Then what was wrong back there? Why did you leave so suddenly?"  
“那刚才怎么了？你为什么突然离开？”

"I didn't like it there. The Cola was watered down and the atmosphere sucked."  
“我不喜欢那里。可乐兑了水，气氛也很糟糕。”

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"What damn it!" "该死的！"

"Why are you being like this!"  
"你为什么这样！"

"I'm not being like anything!"  
"我没有怎样！"

"Yes you are, you're angry at something which has no basis."  
"是的，你生气了，尽管这毫无根据。"

"I'm not mad!" "我没生气！"

'Yes you are,' replied the voice in her mind.  
'你就是生气了，'她脑海中的声音回答道。

'No I'm not!' '不，我没有！'

'You didn't like how easily they got along. You didn't like that they had been able to talk so easily with each other, while you and Shinji are still rocky to this day.'  
'你不喜欢他们相处得如此融洽。你不喜欢他们能如此轻松地交谈，而你和真嗣至今关系仍不稳定。'

'Shut the fuck up!' '闭嘴！'

'You were annoyed!' '你感到烦躁！'

'Shut up!' '闭嘴！'

'You hated it!' '你讨厌它！'

'Shut up!' '闭嘴！'

'You were jealous.' '你嫉妒了。'

"IS IT SO WRONG FOR ME TO HATE IT!" Asuka yelled into the open air, completely catching Shinji of guard.  
"我讨厌它有错吗！" 明日香对着空旷的空气大喊，完全出乎真嗣的意料。

"IS IT WRONG FOR ME TO FEEL ANNOYED! IS IT WRONG FOR ME TO FEEL JEALOUS!"  
"我感到烦躁有错吗！我感到嫉妒有错吗！"

"Asuka," said Shinji attempted to stop her screaming, but was brutally cut off by the next sentence.  
"明日香," 真嗣试图阻止她的尖叫，却被下一句话无情打断。

"YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT CARES ABOUT ME! NOBODY ELSE DOES! MY FATHER, MY STEPMOTHER THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ME! I HATE THE FEELING OF LONELINESS. I DON'T WANT TO EVER FEEL IT EVER AGAIN. I DON'T WANT YOU TAKEN FROM ME!"  
"你是唯一关心我的人！其他人都不在乎！我的父亲，我的继母，他们根本不在乎我！我讨厌孤独的感觉。我不想再经历那种感觉了。我不想你离开我！"

"Asuka, I'm not going anywhere," Shinji attempted at a normal volume conversation.  
"明日香，我不会离开的，" 真嗣尝试以正常的音量交谈。

"LIAR! DO YOU KNOW HOW WORRIED I WAS WHEN YOU HAD BEEN CONFINED AT NERV! EACH DAY WAS A STRUGGLE! EACH DAY I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO CONTINUE WITHOUT YOU THERE! EACH DAY WAS...Each Day Was...each day was..."  
"骗子！你知道我在你被关在 NERV 时有多担心吗！每一天都是挣扎！每一天我都得强迫自己继续下去，没有你在身边！每一天都是……每一天都是……每一天都是……"

Asuka's words slowly sank into a dull whisper.  
明日香的话渐渐沉入低沉的喃喃自语。

"Asuka, I told you, it was never like that with Rebecca, and I'm not leaving yo-."  
"明日香，我告诉过你，我和丽贝卡之间从不是那样，我不会离开你的——"

"Why! Why is it like this!"  
“为什么！为什么会这样！”

"Asuka wha-" "明日香，什——"

She suddenly crashed into him with her full body weighed, sending him reeling backwards onto the hard cement sidewalk.  
她突然全身重量撞向他，让他踉跄后退，跌倒在坚硬的水泥人行道上。

"Asuka what are you-" “明日香，你在干什么——”

Her fist pounded against his chest.  
她的拳头重重地捶打在他的胸口。

"I hate this feeling," she whispered.  
"我讨厌这种感觉，"她低声说道。

"Asu-"

'I HATE THIS FEELING!" she yelled as she pounded her fist against his chest again, angry tears streaming down her face and splashing onto Shinji's shirt.  
'我讨厌这种感觉！"她大喊着，再次用拳头捶打他的胸膛，愤怒的泪水顺着脸颊流下，溅在真嗣的衬衫上。

"I hate it, I hate it, I hate it...but I cant get rid of it damn it! Why? Why do you always make me feel so-"  
"我讨厌它，我讨厌它，我讨厌它……但我就是摆脱不了，该死！为什么？为什么你总是让我感觉如此——"

Shinji's index finger pressed against Asuka's warm lips, affectively silencing her rant.  
真嗣的食指轻按在明日香温热的唇上，有效地让她停止了抱怨。

"Asuka...stop please, you're crushing me."  
"明日香...请停下来，你快把我压垮了。"

"I don't care about that right now," she retorted through half closed lips. "I don't care about angels, Evangelions, or if the whole fucking world explodes right now. Right now...all I care about is you and me."  
"我现在不在乎那些，"她半闭着嘴反驳道，"我不在乎天使、福音战士，也不在乎整个世界现在是否爆炸。现在...我只在乎你和我。"

"Then can you please get off me already?"  
"那你能请从我身上下来吗？"

"No...not until you promise me something."  
"不……除非你答应我一件事。"

"What?" "什么？"

"...That you'll never look at anybody else..."  
"……答应我你永远不会再看别人……"

"Asuka thats rather hard to-"  
"明日香，这有点难——"

"Of the opposite sex! Do I really need to spell it out for you!"  
"异性！我真得给你说清楚吗！"

"Even so...oh...I get it."  
"即便如此...哦...我明白了。"

"You're mine and mine alone...nobody else's."  
"你是我的，只属于我一个人...不属于任何人。"

"Then does that go for me also?"  
"那么，这也适用于我吗？"

"What? Of course not...I'm still free after all."  
"什么？当然不...毕竟我还是自由的。"

"Fine, great, can you get off me now? I think I bruised my spine."  
"好了，很好，你现在能从我身上下来吗？我觉得我的脊椎都青了。"

"Shinji!" “真嗣！”

"What!" “什么！”

It was then that Shinji realized just how serious Asuka was about this as he looked back into her sky blue eyes. He wasn't sure when it had all happened, but he supposed that it had been coming on for a while. They were both just to stupid to accept it earlier.  
就在那时，真嗣才意识到明日香对此有多认真，当他回望她湛蓝的双眼时。他不确定这一切是什么时候发生的，但他猜想这已经酝酿了一段时间。他们俩都太愚蠢，没能早点接受这一点。

"Promise me you wont leave...ever...I can bear everything else...but I can't bear losing you again. Not to another person, not to laboratory experiments, not to death."  
"答应我你不会离开……永远……我什么都能忍受……但我无法忍受再次失去你。不是因为另一个人，不是因为实验室实验，也不是因为死亡。"

"My spine..." "我的脊椎..."

"Shinji...please. I know I've asked much from you...but this, this one thing..."  
"真嗣...请。我知道我向你索求太多...但这件事，就这一件..."

At that point, the pain in Shinji's back suddenly disappeared, leaving a warmth he had never felt. Propping himself up on his arms, he looked Asuka in the eye and said, "I promise never to leave you, nor look at any other woman...is that good enough?"  
就在那时，真嗣背上的疼痛突然消失了，取而代之的是一种从未有过的温暖。他用手臂撑起身体，直视着明日香的双眼说道：“我发誓永远不会离开你，也不会再看其他女人...这样够了吗？”

"It'll do," said Asuka thoughtfully. "Though you didn't word it very well...it sounded like some wedding vow."  
"这样就可以了，" 明日香若有所思地说，"虽然你表达得不太好...听起来像婚礼誓词似的。"

"It felt like one," said Shinji blushing slightly.  
"感觉确实像，" 真嗣微微脸红地说。"

"You better keep your word...if not I'll-."  
"你最好说到做到...否则我可要..."

"Kill me, yes I know."  
"杀了我吧，我知道的。"

"Correct...now I suppose I should get off you...my legs are starting to hurt anyway."  
"对……现在我该从你身上下来了……我的腿也开始疼了。"

"Ah...wait a minute Asuka."  
"啊……等一下，明日香。"

"What?" "什么？"

Asuka blinked and Shinji had moved so fast that she was now looking partially down his shirt and the other part was looking at his chin.  
明日香眨了眨眼，真嗣动作快得让她现在一半目光落在他衬衫上，另一半则盯着他的下巴。

"Huh?" she thought as she felt Shinji's warm breath against her forehead, parting her bangs slightly.  
“啊？”她心想，感觉到真嗣温暖的呼吸拂过她的额头，轻轻拨开了她的刘海。

"Shi-Shin-Shinji...what are you-"  
“真-真-真嗣……你在干-”

Asuka's optical nerves shut down completely as Shinji's lips made contact with her forehead, and her entire body suddenly shut down shortly after that. Every nerve in her suddenly felt the huge electrical shock surge through her body as her brain registered the fact that Shinji's lips were touching her skin. If smoke could come out of ears from a fried brain, they would have here.  
当真嗣的唇触碰到明日香的前额时，她的视觉神经彻底关闭，紧接着全身机能也突然停止。每一根神经都感受到了巨大的电击般冲击，她的脑海中清晰地意识到真嗣的唇正贴在自己的肌肤上。如果大脑被烧焦时耳朵会冒烟，那么此刻她的耳朵应该已经冒烟了。

Shinji softly pressed his lips against her forehead, and parted them slightly, inhaling the flowery scent that he was so accustomed to...though this time it was overpowering, and he felt his mind slipping. Trying to ignore the burning sensation in his stomach, he felt that he could no longer sit up as such, and let his body go falling back to the earth. Well, he thought that he had surprised Asuka mightily well at least, and sure enough when he looked up at her, still straddling his waist, she looked like an overripe strawberry. He couldn't imagine he looked much better though; his face felt incredibly flushed.  
真嗣轻轻地将唇压在她的额头上，微微张开，吸入那熟悉的花香……尽管这次格外浓烈，他感到自己的意识在逐渐模糊。努力忽视胃部灼烧的感觉，他发现自己再也无法保持坐姿，于是任由身体向后倒下。好吧，他想至少自己给明日香带来了极大的惊喜，果然，当他抬头看她时，她仍跨坐在他的腰间，看起来就像一颗熟透的草莓。不过他想象自己的样子也好不到哪儿去；他的脸颊异常通红。

"So..." said Shinji trying to sound as though nothing had just happened, "you can get off me now."  
“那么……”真嗣试图表现得好像什么都没发生过一样，“你现在可以下来了。”

Silence was greeted at his words.  
他的话迎来了一片沉默。

"Asuka...are you going to get off or-"  
“明日香……你到底下不下车或者——”

"Shinji, y-you j-just...k-k-kiss-"  
“真嗣，你、你刚、刚……亲、亲——”

"...Yeah, I did. So can you please get off-"  
"...嗯，我做了。所以你能请下来吗-"

The shock of what Shinji had done seemed to be too much for Asuka to handle, and she leaned like a drunk to her left and slid off of Shinji's waist.  
真嗣所做之事带来的震惊似乎对明日香来说太过沉重，她像醉酒般向左倾斜，从真嗣的腰间滑落。

"Oi Asuka! Are you okay?"  
"喂，明日香！你还好吗？"

"Of course not you idiot," she managed to mumble back. "You just...for no reason...bothers...me..."  
"当然不是你这个白痴，"她勉强咕哝着回答，"你只是...无缘无故...惹恼...我..."

"Well, I don't know about the no reason part but-"  
"嗯，我不确定是否真的无缘无故，但是-"

"Forget it," mumbled Asuka, sitting upright with her legs crossed blushing furiously. "It was just because of the moment...so I'll forgive you for it."  
"算了，"明日香咕哝着，双腿交叉坐直，脸红得厉害，"只是因为那个时刻...所以我会原谅你的。"

'Are you sure you didn't enjoy it?' thought Shinji silently to himself.  
“你确定你不喜欢吗？”真嗣默默地想。

"So are you still planning on going shopping?" asked Shinji.  
“那么，你还是打算去购物吗？”真嗣问道。

"...No, I don't think I ever intended to...I just...wanted to spend some time with you today...just the two of us, since we hardly get this chance now days."  
“……不，我想我从没打算去……我只是……今天想和你一起度过一些时间……就我们两个人，因为现在我们很少有这样的机会了。”

"...Then where should we go?" said Shinji standing up and holding out his hand to Asuka.  
“……那我们该去哪儿？” 真嗣站起身来，向明日香伸出手。

"No clue, some food first I suppose," replied Asuka, accepting Shinji's gesture and placing her hand in his.  
“不知道，先找点吃的吧，我想。” 明日香回答道，接受了真嗣的邀请，将手放在他的手中。

Shinji effortlessly lifted Asuka to her feet; she was really quite light.  
真嗣轻松地将明日香扶起；她真的很轻。

"Hmm...I think I have a place in mind," said Shinji.  
"嗯...我想我有个地方在脑海里，" 真嗣说道。

Asuka narrowed her eyes slightly in suspicion, "It better be good, for making up what happened earlier."  
明日香微微眯起眼睛，带着一丝怀疑，"那地方最好不错，为了弥补之前发生的事。"

"You're saying you don't like Rebecca?"  
"你是说你不喜欢丽贝卡？"

"No I like her, but I don't like the fact that you two seemed so close."  
"不，我喜欢她，但我讨厌你们俩看起来那么亲密。"

"So you were jealous?" "所以你嫉妒了？"

Asuka muttered something unintelligible, which Shinji to mean she didn't want to talk about what she had said recently.  
明日香咕哝了一句听不清的话，这让真嗣觉得她不想再谈最近她说过的事情。

"So where is this place?"  
"那这个地方在哪儿？"

"Where I used to live before I met Misato. Its a ways away, but it is good...italian food."  
"在我遇见美里之前住的地方。虽然有点远，但那里的意大利菜很不错。"

"Like I'll believe the Japanese even know how to make italian...but whatever, lead the way I suppose."  
"我倒要看看日本人能做出什么样的意大利菜……不过算了，带路吧。"

"Hmmm, okay then." "嗯，好吧。"

Strangely enough, since Shinji had lifted Asuka to her feet, their hands had not parted.  
说来也怪，自从真嗣将明日香扶起后，他们的手就一直未曾分开。

Gendo stood in his dark office, flexing his right hand and examining the way the new skin had flaked over the old. The dead skin cells were already starting to flake off, and he didn't know how long he'd be able to maintain his new right hand; the decay had already started to set in. After all, his body wasn't fit to contain an angels DNA. However...soon he would be reunited with the one he loved. But things were becoming more complicated. Seele was bound to interfere soon, as they have started to look into Shinji's back history, and then unconfirmed rumors of the fourth child being selected had reached his ears. The Eva series was nearing its completion, while Unit 01 had finally consumed the S2 engine...and yet something seemed amiss. Things had not gone completely the way his design of fifteen years had predicted. Almost as though some outside interference was changing the way things were meant to be.  
碇源堂站在他昏暗的办公室里，活动着右手，审视着新长出的皮肤如何覆盖旧皮。死皮细胞已经开始脱落，他不知道自己还能保持这只新手多久；腐烂已经开始。毕竟，他的身体并不适合容纳天使的 DNA。然而……很快他就能与所爱之人重聚。但事情正变得复杂。Seele 肯定会很快介入，因为他们已经开始调查真嗣的背景，而关于第四适格者被选中的未经证实的传言也传到了他的耳中。EVA 系列即将完成，而零号机终于吞噬了 S2 引擎……然而，总感觉有些不对劲。事情并没有完全按照他十五年前的设计发展。仿佛有某种外部干扰正在改变事物应有的轨迹。

'Lilith and Adam?' he thought silently. 'The harbingers of death and rebirth...'  
"“莉莉丝和亚当？”他默默思索，“死亡与重生的先兆……”

### Chapter 19: Continuation  
第十九章：延续  

**Longest chapter so far...phew. After that last one I was in such a great mood that I wrote this one a lot faster than I intended. On another note...THANKS FOR THE 100+ REVIEWS. Seriously though, I never thought this story would ever become this popular. Thanks a bunch to everybody who's given me support over the years. I'm hopefully finishing this by summer (I'm literally praying for it) because I'm so excited about the sequel, but of course I can't start that until this is finished. On a side note in response to Edopt90: As I was working on that last chapter phrases from Re-Take were coming to me, and I remember deleting some stuff because it felt _too_ similar to Re-take. Be that as it may I believe I do get some of my inspiration from Re-Take, having the entire series sitting in a folder on my desktop. Its a fabulous story and any fan of AsukaXShinji should check it out.  
迄今为止最长的一章...呼。上一章结束后我心情大好，写这一章的速度比预期的快多了。另外...感谢超过 100 条的评论。说真的，我从没想过这个故事会变得这么受欢迎。感谢多年来所有给予我支持的人。我希望能在这个夏天完成它（我真的是在祈祷），因为我对续集非常兴奋，但当然，我得先完成这部作品才能开始续集。顺便回应一下 Edopt90：在写上一章时，《Re-Take》的某些句子浮现在我脑海中，我记得删除了一些内容，因为它们感觉太像《Re-Take》了。尽管如此，我相信我从《Re-Take》中获得了一些灵感，毕竟整个系列就放在我电脑桌面的一个文件夹里。这是一部精彩的故事，任何喜欢明日香和真嗣的读者都应该看看。**

**Okay I'm done...start reading.  
好了，我写完了...开始阅读吧。**

"I can't believe I'm saying this, but this place isn't so bad," said Asuka as she stabbed another piece of chicken with her fork.  
"真不敢相信我居然这么说，但这地方其实还不错，" 明日香一边说，一边用叉子又叉起一块鸡肉。

...That was rather an understatement  
...这话倒是相当低调了

Her and Shinji were sitting outside the Italian restaurant that Shinji had mentioned earlier. At first Asuka was rather reluctant about eating there, never caring much for Italian food. Though after they entered, and the aroma of rich garlicky food entered her nostrils, she quickly changed her mind.  
她和真嗣正坐在真嗣之前提到的那家意大利餐厅外。起初明日香对在那里吃饭相当不情愿，她向来不太喜欢意大利菜。但当他们走进去，浓郁的蒜香食物气息扑鼻而来时，她很快改变了主意。

The weather reflected there moods towards each other, which was significantly better than it had been in recent months. As such, they had decided that eating outside would be a nice change.  
天气映照着他们彼此间的心情，比起近几个月来有了显著的改善。因此，他们决定在外面用餐会是一个不错的改变。

There was a small tile patio behind the restaurant in the shape of a small rectangle. Around the outer edges of the patio, a large hedge had been raised off the ground, supported by a brick layer all around the edges, with soil to hold the hedges in place. Small pockets of flowers lined the hedge rows around where Shinji and Asuka sat.  
餐厅后面有一个小矩形瓷砖露台。露台的外围，一圈高大的灌木被砖层支撑着，四周填满了土壤以固定灌木。灌木丛间点缀着一簇簇小花，环绕着真嗣和明日香所坐的地方。

The table they were sitting at was made out of pine, while the chairs with the wooden backs were likewise made out of pine. Shielding them from the harmful rays of the sun was a large umbrella that completely covered the circular table, creating a sort of cocoon like environment that only Asuka and Shinji were present under. The tablecloth that adorned there table was simple cotton, with pictures of grapes placed sporadically around each other with increments of seven inches between them.  
他们所坐的桌子是用松木制成的，带有木质靠背的椅子也同样由松木制成。一把大伞遮挡住了圆桌，为他们挡住了有害的阳光，营造出一种只有真嗣和明日香存在的茧状环境。桌布是简单的棉布，上面零星点缀着葡萄图案，每七个英寸就有一个间隔。

Not knowing specifically what to order, Asuka had left the decision up to Shinji and had been afraid that she would be regretting it. Her worries were unsubstantial, as the chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was quite good. Shinji had order some sort of spaghetti and meatballs, with ground up basil cloves sprinkled around the spaghetti sauce. She had an idea that no matter what he would have ordered for her, she would have enjoyed it.  
不知道具体该点什么，明日香把决定权交给了真嗣，心里却担心自己会后悔。但她的担忧是多余的，因为那道鸡肉意大利宽面阿尔弗雷多非常美味。真嗣点了一份意面配肉丸，还在番茄酱里撒了些碎罗勒叶。她觉得无论他为她点什么，她都会喜欢。

"German food isn't the only thing in the world you know. Honestly, I don't see how you haven't gotten tired of all that fatty food yet," replied Shinji to Asuka's earlier comment.  
“德国菜可不是世界上唯一的东西，你知道的。说真的，我真不明白你怎么还没吃腻那些油腻的食物，”真嗣回应着明日香之前的评论。

Considering that they were on relatively good speaking terms, Asuka decided not to rebuke him for the fatty remark.  
考虑到他们现在的关系还算融洽，明日香决定不因那句“油腻”的话而反驳他。

"Then do you hate Japanese food or something? You never seem to really stick with one thing."  
"那么你是讨厌日本料理还是怎么的？你似乎从来不能真正坚持吃一样东西。"

"No, I've just tried many different types of foods and sorta built my own taste. Also, because of how much I used to move around, I ended up eating out a lot since I never had much of an opportunity to cook."  
"不，我只是尝试过很多不同类型的食物，逐渐形成了自己的口味。而且，因为我以前经常搬家，所以经常在外面吃，因为很少有机会自己做饭。"

"So you consider it lucky that Misato is such a bad cook?" asked Asuka, inserting one of many jabs about Misato's cooking.  
""所以你觉得幸运的是美里厨艺那么糟糕？"" 明日香问道，插入了关于美里厨艺的众多调侃之一。

"Well, I won't deny that it wouldn't be such a bad change to have someone else do the cooking for once." Shinji said this with a subtle hint directed at Asuka.  
"嗯，我不会否认偶尔有人替我做饭也不是什么坏事。" 真嗣这番话中隐约指向了明日香。

"...What you want me to cook more often or something?" asked Asuka getting the meaning behind his words.  
"...你是想让我多做几次饭吗？" 明日香领会了他话中的含义，问道。

"...I can't deny I'd enjoy it...and not just breakfast."  
"...我不能否认我会很享受...不仅仅是早餐。"

Asuka thought about this for a moment with her arm propped up on the table and her chin resting in the palm of her hand.  
明日香一边用手臂撑着桌子，一边用下巴抵在手掌上，沉思了一会儿。

"I'll think about it," she said eventually. "I suppose it wouldn't hurt to remind myself a few things now and then. And I can also show you how to make a proper German dish."  
“我会考虑的，”她最终说道，“我想偶尔提醒自己一些事情也无妨。而且我还可以教你做一道正宗的德国菜。”

'Wonderful,' thought Shinji silently, meaning both good and bad.  
“太好了，”真嗣默默地想，这既好又坏。

"But as for then and now," said Asuka turning back to her plate, "why haven't you ever cooked something like this?"  
"但说到过去和现在，" 明日香转回她的盘子，"你为什么从没做过这样的菜？"

"...I figured you'd never eat it."  
"...我以为你绝不会吃的。"

"Well before this I might not have...but I can't imagine your cooking is better than this."  
"在这之前我可能不会...但我无法想象你的厨艺能比这更好。"

"...Thanks" "...谢谢"

"Anytime," replied Asuka heartily.  
"随时乐意，" 明日香热情地回答。

"So then what happens after this?"  
"那接下来会发生什么？"

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"I mean...what should we do?"  
"我的意思是...我们该怎么办？"

Asuka paused here for a moment, but her mind went back to something she had said before, and she figured that since they had left Nerv, she had silently been thinking of this.  
明日香在这里停顿了一下，但她的思绪回到了之前说过的话，她意识到自从他们离开 NERV 后，她一直在默默地思考这个问题。

"I'm gonna take you up on that offer you made."  
"我要接受你之前提出的那个提议。"

"What offer?" "什么提议？"

"The one where I make you take me around Tokyo-3 and buy anything I want."  
"就是我让你带我在第三新东京市逛逛，买我想要的东西。"

"...I'm fairly certain I never agreed to something like that...at least conscious. And I think that was something you just decided on the spot."  
"……我很确定我没同意过这种事……至少在清醒状态下。而且我觉得那是你临时起意决定的。"

"Either way," Asuka paused and looked across the table into Shinji's eyes, "Consider it compensation for worrying me to death...and...about earlier." This last part was referring to her emotional outburst, which she still seemed somewhat embarrassed about. Some of the things she had said...well, they were things that she had kept bottled up for a while.  
“无论如何，” 明日香停顿了一下，目光越过桌子直视着真嗣的眼睛，“就当是补偿你让我担心得要命……还有……关于之前的事。” 这最后一部分指的是她情绪爆发的那一刻，她似乎仍然有些尴尬。她说的那些话……嗯，都是她憋了很久的话。

"So then its like a...date?"  
“那这算是个……约会吗？”

Normally Asuka would have thrown herself across the table and strangled Shinji for even using that word in a sentence when it involved them, though she was in an unusually good mood right and simply said, "If thats what you want to call it, then sure its a date."  
通常情况下，明日香会扑过桌子去掐死真嗣，就因为他敢在涉及他们的话题中使用那个词，不过她现在心情异常好，只是简单地说：“如果你非要这么叫的话，那就算是约会吧。”

The fact that she had accepted it as something like a date completely threw Shinji a right hook, stunning him momentarily.  
她竟然将这视为一种类似约会的活动，这突如其来的一击让真嗣彻底懵了，一时之间不知所措。

"Okay then," he said, trying to grasp control of the situation, while throughout it all Asuka was watching him silently with strange expression on her face. It was almost expecting.  
“好吧，”他试图掌控局面，而整个过程中，明日香静静地注视着他，脸上带着一种近乎期待的奇怪表情。

"Then...what exactly did you have in mind for this..." Shinji still couldn't bring himself to think of it as a date.  
“那么……你究竟是怎么看待这次……”真嗣还是无法说服自己将其视为一次约会。

"No clue," said Asuka idly. In truth, she just wanted to spend time with him, and frankly didn't give a damn where and what they did, as long as they were together.  
"不知道，" 明日香随意地说道。实际上，她只是想和他共度时光，坦白说，只要他们在一起，她并不在乎去哪里或做什么。

"...Well there is the aquarium I suppose. I've heard its got some pre-Second Impact animals from Antarctica there."  
"...嗯，我想水族馆也可以。听说那里有一些来自南极的第二次冲击前的动物。"

"Where is it?" "它在哪儿？"

"From here...a few miles I think. We can get a cab I guess or-"  
"从这里...我想有几英里。我们可以打车，或者——"

"No, we walk," said Asuka, interjecting her own thoughts into the conversation.  
"不，我们走路，" 明日香插话，将自己的想法带入对话中。

"You sure? It might take us some time so-"  
"你确定吗？可能要花我们一些时间，所以——"

"We walk," replied Asuka stubbornly, slight irritation showing on her face.  
“我们走着去，”明日香固执地回答，脸上显露出些许恼怒。

"...Okay then...if thats what you want. But don't expect me to carry you if your feet start hurting."  
“……好吧……既然你这么想。但别指望我会背你，如果你的脚开始疼的话。”

Asuka let out an indignant, "Hmph," and looked down at her sure to be cold food now, her appetite slipping.  
明日香不满地哼了一声，“哼”，低头看着她那肯定已经凉了的饭菜，食欲逐渐消退。

Dear God didn't he get it? Or did she have to write it down on a piece of paper for him?  
天哪，他难道不明白吗？还是她得把这事儿写下来给他看？

'How did I end up stuck with someone like him?' thought Asuka moodily.  
‘我怎么就摊上他这么个人呢？’明日香心情郁闷地想。

"Hurry up and finish then," she said, clearly becoming annoyed. "Its already past noon and I'd rather not be back at Nerv around midnight."  
“快点儿弄完，”她说，显然已经不耐烦了，“已经过了中午了，我可不想半夜才回到 NERV。”

Ignoring the prospect of mousse chocolate cake for desert, they paid for their food and started walking in the direction of the museum.  
无视了甜点中慕斯巧克力蛋糕的诱惑，他们付了餐费，开始朝着博物馆的方向走去。

They walked side by side, and to any normal passerby, looked like two teenagers simply enjoying the rare chance to see even a glimpse of the sun. To the two of them however, what they were doing was far from what they considered normal. Neither could help but steal glances at the other if they thought one was looking the other way, though when there eyes met, they became briefly flustered and tried to pass it off as random occurrence. If this had happened once or twice instead of ten times, the random occurrence explanation would have made sense.  
他们并肩而行，在外人看来，就像是两个青少年难得有机会享受阳光的照耀。然而对他们两人来说，这远非他们所认为的正常。两人都不由自主地偷瞄对方，以为对方没有注意到，但当视线交汇时，他们又会短暂地慌乱，试图将其解释为偶然事件。如果这种情况只发生了一两次而不是十次，那么偶然事件的解释或许还说得通。

After what felt like at least a mile, they were both starting to sweat openly, with the hot sun beating down on the backs of their necks. The temperature had to be pushing ninety at least, and Shinji momentarily felt that rain water would have felt extremely good when Asuka pointed out an ice cream parlor across the street.  
走了至少一英里后，两人都开始明显出汗，烈日炙烤着他们的后颈。气温至少有九十度，真嗣一时觉得雨水会非常舒适，这时明日香指着街对面的冰淇淋店。

"We really shouldn't," said Shinji quickly. "I don't know how much longer it'll take us to get to the aquarium, nor whether it will take time to get in."  
"我们真的不该这么做，" 真嗣迅速说道。"我不知道我们到水族馆还要多久，也不知道进去会不会花时间。"

"But it'll be cooler in there," said Asuka as she grabbed Shinji's hand and started tugging him across the street. "And I feel disgusting with all this sweat."  
"但里面会凉快些，" 明日香说着抓住真嗣的手，开始拉着他穿过街道。"而且我浑身是汗，感觉糟透了。"

'It was your decision to walk,' thought Shinji silently, though Asuka gave him a look as though she had read his mind.  
'是你决定要走路的，' 真嗣默默地想，尽管明日香给了他一个眼神，仿佛读懂了他的心思。

"C'mon...it beats standing out here and arguing about it in the baking hot sun."  
"来吧...总比站在这里在炙热的太阳下争论要好。"

'She does have a point,' a voice in Shinji's mind replied.  
'她说的有道理，'一个声音在真嗣的脑海中回应道。

"Alright," said Shinji relenting to Asuka's request.  
"好吧，"真嗣在明日香的要求下让步了。

Inside the ice cream parlor was much cooler as Asuka had predicted and it looked as though they weren't the only ones with the same idea; a large group of people were clustered around the small shop, taking up so much space that Asuka and Shinji had to practically fight there way to get to the front counter.  
正如明日香所预料的那样，冰淇淋店内的确凉快许多，而且看来他们并非唯一有此想法的人；一大群人聚集在这家小店周围，占据了太多空间，以至于明日香和真嗣几乎要奋力挤过人群才能到达前台。

"One strawberry vanilla for me...single scoop...and...Shinji what do you want," asked Asuka as she turned her head towards him, a slight smile threatening to part her lips. Shinji had to suppress the tingling feel in his stomach then, as her actions were so unlike her that they made his head hurt.  
“我要一份草莓香草混合的……单球……还有……真嗣，你想要什么？”明日香转头问他，嘴角微微上扬，似乎要露出笑容。那一刻，真嗣不得不压抑住胃里那阵酥麻的感觉，因为她的举动与平时大相径庭，让他感到一阵头疼。

"Err...one vanilla for me, and single scoop as well."  
“呃……我要一份香草的，也是单球。”

"Coming right up," replied the cashier who looked as though he was about Rebecca's age.  
"马上就来，" 收银员回答道，看起来大约和丽贝卡同龄。

Fighting there way back through the crowd, with their hands linked this time, they made there way to a small table at the back of the shop and sat down.  
他们这次手牵手，奋力穿过人群，来到了店里后方的一张小桌子旁坐下。

"We really shouldn't just sit here and eat these like this," said Shinji before he started licking his ice cream.  
"我们真的不应该就这样坐在这里吃，" 真嗣说着，开始舔他的冰淇淋。

"What? And let it melt outside? Not a chance," replied Asuka who had already started on her ice cream.  
“什么？让它在外面融化？没门，”明日香回答道，她已经开始吃她的冰淇淋了。

For a second, Shinji couldn't help but gaze at her, unable to look away from the cute face she made as she ate her ice cream. To Shinji, it was like a blessing from the gods. To think that he'd be happily sitting here with Asuka, acting as though they were normal, and eating ice cream. He half expected the front door of the shop to explode outward and a scattering of bullets to come pounding through the windows. It felt too serene.  
有那么一瞬间，真嗣忍不住盯着她看，无法从她吃冰淇淋时可爱的表情中移开视线。对真嗣来说，这就像是神的恩赐。没想到他能和明日香坐在这里，表现得像普通人一样，吃着冰淇淋。他半期待着店门会突然爆炸，子弹从窗户穿透进来。这种宁静感太过分了。

"Whats up?" asked Asuka when Shinji still hadn't started his ice cream and she was already half way done with hers.  
“怎么了？”明日香问道，当真嗣还没开始吃他的冰淇淋时，她已经吃了一半了。

"Just noticing how weird it is to be out here...with other people I suppose. Its almost like we're...normal."  
"刚刚注意到在外面...和别人在一起有多奇怪。感觉我们几乎像是...正常的。"

"Really? I've never had that impression before."  
"真的吗？我以前从未有过这种感觉。"

"Just seeing all these people around...I guess we are just a small part of the world when you think about it."  
"只是看到周围这么多人...想想看，我们只是世界的一小部分。"

"Well of course, there's something like ten billion people on the planet."  
"当然，地球上有大约一百亿人口。"

"No I know...just that what we've been doing with Nerv...I wonder how much it affects other peoples lives, not just inside Tokyo-3...but outside of Japan."  
"我知道……只是我们一直在 NERV 做的事情……我想知道这对其他人的生活有多大影响，不仅仅是东京-3 内部……还有日本以外的地方。"

"Why worry about it?" asked Asuka almost bored. "We have a job that only we can do, while other people have a job that only they can do also. Its pointless worrying about what tomorrow might bring."  
"为什么要担心呢？" 明日香几乎有些无聊地问。"我们有只有我们能做的工作，而其他人也有只有他们能做的工作。担心明天会带来什么是没有意义的。"

"No...I suppose that you're righ-Isn't that Touji and Hikari over there?"  
“不……我想你是对的——那不是东治和光吗？”

Its a good thing that the shop was so crowded and so many voices were echoing off the walls, because Asuka spun in her chair so quickly that the sound of the legs screeching against the floor sounded like fifty nails on a chalkboard.  
幸好店里人声鼎沸，回音四起，因为明日香转椅子转得太快，椅腿摩擦地板的声音听起来就像五十根指甲在黑板上刮过一样刺耳。

Shinji didn't have nearly the same reaction as she did, and found it rather comical that she was so intrigued by this so suddenly. Even so, he couldn't help but wonder what those two unlikely people were doing sitting across a table from each other. Then again, him and Asuka were doing the same thing so he supposed it wasn't his place to speculate.  
真嗣的反应远没有明日香那么大，他觉得她突然对这件事如此感兴趣颇为滑稽。即便如此，他还是忍不住好奇那两个看似不搭调的人坐在同一张桌子对面在做什么。不过话说回来，他和明日香也在做同样的事，所以他觉得这不是他该揣测的。

"Its about damn time," whispered Asuka to herself more than ever, though of course Shinji had no trouble picking it up.  
“真是该死的时间到了。”明日香自言自语地低声说道，尽管当然，真嗣毫不费力地听到了。

"Whats about damn time?" “什么该死的时间到了？”

Looking back at him, Asuka didn't see the harm in telling him...so she did.  
回头看着他，明日香觉得告诉他也没什么坏处……于是她说了。

"Hikari has liked that idiot for a while...why I can't possibly imagine, but it looks as though they've finally gotten together."  
"光喜欢那个傻瓜已经有一段时间了...我实在无法想象为什么，但看起来他们终于在一起了。"

"Touji and Hikari? I don't know...doesn't seem like a very likely pairing."  
"东治和光？我不确定...这看起来不太像是一个很般配的组合。"

'And yet here you and I are, talking with each other,' thought Asuka.  
“然而你我就在这里，彼此交谈着，”明日香心想。

"Hikari's been slowly making advances on him, making his lunch and what not. I guess she finally called him out today."  
“光一直在慢慢向他示好，给他做午饭什么的。我想她今天终于约他出去了。”

Shinji paused for a minute before saying, "So...how long exactly was I gone from school?"  
真嗣停顿了一会儿，然后问道：“那么……我到底缺课多久了？”

Asuka did her best not to laugh but ended up failing miserably.  
明日香尽力忍住不笑，但最终还是失败了。

"So are you going to walk over there or not?" asked Shinji.  
"所以你打算走过去还是不走？" 真嗣问道。

"What are you stupid? Of course not. I don't even want them to know that we're here." Little did Shinji know, her words held a double meaning.  
"你傻吗？当然不。我甚至不想让他们知道我们在这里。" 真嗣不知道，她的话其实别有深意。

"Then lets leave...I was never one for ice cream anyway."  
"那我们走吧……反正我从来就不喜欢吃冰淇淋。"

---

Back outside, the sun had not relented it scorching hot mercy on the residents of Tokyo-3 and Shinji and Asuka were now subjugated to those same harmful rays.  
回到户外，太阳并未减轻其对东京-3 居民的炙热怜悯，真嗣和明日香如今也遭受着同样有害的阳光照射。

"I know I was sick of all the rain we'd been having, but this burning hotness is just ridiculous," complained Asuka as she fanned her face with her hand. Shinji on the other hand simply smiled and decided not to comment. The sun gleaming off Asuka's bright red hair was about as blinding as directly looking at the sun.  
"我知道我之前对连绵不断的雨感到厌烦，但这灼热感简直荒谬，"明日香一边用手扇风一边抱怨道。而真嗣则只是微笑着，决定不发表评论。阳光照在明日香鲜亮的红发上，其耀眼程度几乎与直视太阳无异。

"How much longer is it?"  
"还有多久啊？"

"I've no idea...just know where its located is all."  
"我完全没概念...只知道它在哪里。"

"How can you know where it is if you've never been there?"  
"如果你从没去过那里，怎么知道它在哪？"

"I've passed it many times before."  
"我之前经过那里很多次了。"

"When you used to walk a lot?"  
"当你以前经常走路的时候？"

"Yeah...and I remember that I had wanted to visit it at least once...with my father actually." Shinji even surprised himself by saying this and his face darkened slightly at the thought of his father.  
"是啊...我记得我曾想至少去那里一次...实际上是和我父亲一起。" 真嗣说出这话时连自己都感到惊讶，一想到父亲，他的脸色微微暗淡下来。

Asuka couldn't help but notice the change in his face and asked, "You really hate him, don't you?"  
明日香忍不住注意到他脸色的变化，问道："你真的很恨他，对吧？"

"...Yeah, I do...for everything."  
"...是啊，我会的...为了所有事。"

"...I suppose it must be hard...knowing that he's so close but so far away."  
"...我想那一定很难...知道他近在咫尺却又遥不可及。"

"...Not really. I got used to his absence so much after my mother died that sometimes I completely forgot about him."  
"...倒也不算。自从母亲去世后，我习惯了他的缺席，以至于有时候我完全忘记了他。"

"Wish I could have done that," mumbled Asuka quietly in reference to her own father.  
"真希望我也能那样做," 明日香低声咕哝着，指的是她自己的父亲。

Shinji's face, if possible, darkened even further at the mention of Asuka's father and his teeth clenched together tightly. He supposed that even after Asuka had left her father for college, there was still that shadow of him constantly there in the back round of her life. Though he supposed he had permanently put a stop to that.  
提到明日香的父亲，真嗣的脸色似乎更加阴沉了，他的牙齿紧紧咬在一起。他猜想，即使明日香为了上大学离开了父亲，她生活中仍然有他的影子挥之不去。尽管他认为自己已经彻底结束了这一切。

"Lets not talk about that right now," Shinji whispered.  
"现在先别谈这个了," 真嗣低声说道。

Asuka, in response to his whispered response, decided to remain silent and drop the topic altogether. Fathers weren't something that either of them had ever had.  
对于他轻声的回应，明日香决定保持沉默，不再提及这个话题。父亲，是他们两人都未曾拥有过的存在。

They walked in silence for the majority of the rest of the time, glancing at each other every so often in hopes that the other would start up a conversation. Ironically enough, during this time of silence, they felt that they were becoming closer to each other...in a physical sense. There hands kept on bumping against each other as though both their bodies were telling them to take action of some kind. Of course neither were really able to accept that innate feeling that they were sharing.  
在接下来的大部分时间里，他们默默地走着，时不时地瞥向对方，希望对方能开启对话。讽刺的是，在这段沉默中，他们感觉彼此在物理上更加接近了...他们的手不断碰撞，仿佛双方的身体都在催促他们采取某种行动。当然，他们都无法真正接受那种共享的本能感觉。

After what felt like hours, and gallons of sweat shed, they finally found themselves standing in front of the cool shade of the entrance to the aquarium. There was a small line at the front of the entrance with a ticket booth on either side of the entrance so the line would move quicker. The entire buildings was rather large, while a small cloth like canopy streaked with green and white stripes jetted out from the front entrance, under which Shinji and Asuka were standing. The outside walls were painted a dark blue while posters of marine animals were plastered all along the walls like at a movie theatre. Shinji found the whole presentation rather stupid, as though there was some Broadway show going on in there.  
经过仿佛数小时和大量汗水的洗礼，他们终于站在了水族馆入口处的凉爽阴影下。入口前有一小队人，两侧各有一个售票亭，以便队伍能更快移动。整个建筑相当宏大，一道绿白条纹相间、形似布篷的遮阳棚从入口处延伸出来，下面站着真嗣和明日香。外墙漆成深蓝色，而墙壁上贴满了海洋动物的海报，宛如电影院一般。真嗣觉得整个布置相当愚蠢，仿佛里面正在上演一场百老汇秀。

As Shinji thought this last bit, Asuka turned to him and asked, "Err, this is the right place...right?"  
正当真嗣这么想着，明日香转向他问道：“呃，这里是对的地方吧...对吧？”

"I think so," replied Shinji looking around as though expecting to see a sign that said, 'yes this is an aquarium.'  
“我想是的，”真嗣环顾四周，仿佛期待能看到一个写着“没错，这里是水族馆”的标志。

"Well lets go then," said Asuka.  
"那我们走吧，" 明日香说道。

The line quickly shortened, and in all most no time at all, Shinji and Asuka found themselves at the ticket booth.  
队伍迅速缩短，几乎转眼间，真嗣和明日香就来到了售票亭前。

"Just the two of you?" asked the ticket handler when they walked up to the booth.  
"就你们两位吗？" 他们走近售票亭时，售票员问道。

"Yeah," said Shinji. "Ten dollars right?"  
“嗯，”真嗣说，“十美元对吧？”

"Five for kids and teenagers yeah...unless wait, are you guys a couple?"  
“儿童和青少年的票价是五美元……除非等等，你们是情侣吗？”

Before Asuka had even a chance to retort angrily, Shinji interjected in front of her.  
在明日香还没来得及愤怒反驳之前，真嗣抢先在她面前开口了。

"...Why?" "...为什么？"

"Discount," the guy responded in a gruff voice as though this was common sense. "Normally its ten dollars, but if you two are a couple I can knock off two dollars."  
"情侣折扣，" 那人用粗鲁的嗓音回答，仿佛这是常识。"通常是十美元，但如果你们俩是情侣，我可以减掉两美元。"

"Whys that?" asked Shinji, hesitating slightly as he could tell that the girl standing beside him was starting to fume angrily.  
"为什么这样？" 真嗣问道，他略显迟疑，因为他能感觉到站在他旁边的女孩开始愤怒地冒火了。"

"Its the special of the day. Sometimes its a discount for old people, sometimes for married grownups with their kids, today its for teenage couples."  
“这是今天的特价。有时候是给老年人的折扣，有时候是给已婚有孩子的成年人，今天则是给青少年情侣的。”

"We're not-" Asuka said hurriedly, though Shinji cut her off.  
“我们不是——” 明日香急忙说道，但真嗣打断了她。

"Yeah we are." “是啊，我们是。”

"Eight dollars then." “那就八美元吧。”

Shinji nodded and wordlessly handed over his Nerv card, during which the ticket handler glanced at it and snorted slightly, not understand how the kid how gotten a debit card such as this.  
真嗣点点头，默默地递出他的 NERV 卡，售票员瞥了一眼，轻蔑地哼了一声，不明白这孩子是如何得到这样一张借记卡的。

Tearing apart two tickets, he handed them to Shinji who in turn passed one wordlessly to Asuka.  
撕开两张票，他把票递给真嗣，真嗣则默默地将其中一张递给了明日香。

"Just continue on through and make your way towards the right...there'll be arrows pointing you in the direction you should take for full exhibit. If you want brochures there are some before the first exhibit, and theres a gift shop at the end of the-"  
“继续往前走，向右转……会有箭头指示你前往完整展览的方向。如果需要宣传册，在第一个展览前有一些，展览的尽头还有一个礼品店——”

Asuka had long ago dragged Shinji wordlessly towards the entrance, leaving the ticket handler rambling on in a business like tone.  
早在之前，明日香就一言不发地拽着真嗣朝入口走去，留下售票员用一种公事公办的语气喋喋不休。

After getting far enough in the aquarium, in which a faint blue color could start to be seen dancing off the walls, Asuka pushed Shinji against a black concrete wall so hard that Shinji thought he had thrown his back out.  
进入水族馆足够深处后，墙壁上开始隐约泛起淡淡的蓝色光芒，明日香猛地将真嗣推到一面黑色混凝土墙上，力度之大让真嗣以为自己的背都要断了。

Snarling at him hatefully, Asuka said, "What exactly was that all about!"  
阿斯克怒气冲冲地瞪着他，说道：“你到底在搞什么鬼！”

"What?" said Shinji innocently, knowing full well what she meant and knowing that he would have had to deal with this when he had said what he said at the ticket booth.  
“什么？”真嗣无辜地回答，心里清楚她指的是什么，也知道自己在售票处说那番话时，迟早要面对这个问题。

"You know damn fucking well what I mean! Us being a couple? The hell is this shi-"  
“你他妈的明明知道我在说什么！我们成一对了？这他妈的是什么鬼——”

"This is a date...which you yourself even said, and besides it doesn't matter whether we are or not because we only got a discoun-"  
"这是一次约会...你自己也这么说过，而且我们是不是并不重要，因为我们只得到了一个折扣-"

"We are not, and who cares about the stupid discount! Nerv pays off our cards every month anyway!"  
"我们不是，谁在乎那个愚蠢的折扣！NERV 每个月都会还清我们的卡！"

"Give it a break Asuka, that guy obviously thought we were a couple anyway so-"  
"别再说了，明日香，那家伙显然以为我们是情侣，所以-"

Asuka's face got so close to Shinji that he was afraid at first that she was going to head but him.  
明日香的脸凑得离真嗣如此之近，以至于他起初还以为她要撞他。

"We are not a couple, nor will we ever be one!"  
“我们不是一对，也永远不会是一对！”

Shinji was silent for a moment. Did he himself think they were a couple? Well maybe the constantly arguing part, though admittedly, they had shared some rather heartfelt moments with each other.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿。他自己是否认为他们是一对呢？或许在不断争吵这方面是的，尽管不可否认，他们确实共享了一些相当真挚的时刻。

"Okay then I get it," said Shinji hurriedly. "But you didn't have to get so upset about it."  
“好吧，我明白了，”真嗣急忙说道，“但你没必要为此这么生气。”

"I'm not upset," said Asuka indignantly. "Its just stupid," here her voice started to get quieter and quieter as she continued saying, "to think that you and me...being a couple...and-"  
“我没生气，”明日香愤愤不平地说，“只是觉得这很蠢，”她的声音越来越小，继续说道，“想到你和我……成为一对……还有——”

She suddenly had a mental image of herself and Shinji stepping out of a Nerv owned vehicle on there way to dinner. Shinji would get out first wearing a tuxedo and turn to her and hold out his hand for her. She would take it and slowly step out of the car and the light would fall on her. Her fiery hair would be tied back and twisted into a tight bun at the top of her head. Her lips would be rosy red and possibly preparing for the evening. The dress she would be wearing would be blood red with laces at the hem of the dress and her hands would be adorned with white gloves. Shinji would hold out his arm and she would take it and together they would walk up the red carpeted stairs into the lobby of some fancy restaurant with a gold chandelier and-  
她突然在脑海中浮现出自己和真嗣从一辆 NERV 所属的车上下来去吃饭的场景。真嗣会先下车，穿着燕尾服，转身向她伸出手。她会握住他的手，缓缓走出车子，灯光照在她身上。她那火红的头发会被束在脑后，紧紧盘成一个发髻。她的嘴唇会是玫瑰红色，或许正为这个夜晚做准备。她穿的裙子会是血红色的，裙摆处有蕾丝装饰，手上戴着白色手套。真嗣会伸出胳膊，她会挽住，两人一起走上铺着红地毯的楼梯，进入某个装饰着金色吊灯的豪华餐厅大堂——

If this was what alcohol was like, than Asuka would have been considered way over the limit as her entire face lit up like the color of the dress she had been imagining. Shinji didn't even seem to notice her lapse in reality as he had already started walking ahead of her.  
如果这就是酒精的感觉，那么明日香的脸红得就像她想象中的那条裙子的颜色一样，她肯定已经超出了酒精限制。真嗣似乎完全没有注意到她现实中的失态，因为他已经开始走在她前面了。

Asuka placed both her hands on her face in an embarrassed gesture that together with the rapid blush that was spreading across her cheeks, would have been too much for Shinji's mind to handle. Simply put...it was beyond cute.  
明日香双手捂住脸，羞涩的动作加上迅速蔓延到脸颊的红晕，对真嗣的思维来说实在是太过分了。简单来说...这实在是太可爱了。

'M-me a-and Sh-Sh-Shi-Shinji?' she stammered in her confused mind. 'Impossible, we can barely even get along properly to be considered friends.'  
'我...我和...真...真嗣？'她困惑地结巴着，'不可能，我们连正常相处都做不到，更别提成为朋友了。'

'But you care about him,' said another voice in her head.  
“但你关心他，”她脑海中另一个声音说道。

'Of course I do...but not like that. Never like that...'  
“我当然关心……但不是那种方式。绝不是那种方式……”

The voice in her head didn't bothering responding back, as though it knew how pointless the conversation would end up.  
她脑海中的声音没有再回应，仿佛知道这场对话最终会变得毫无意义。

Trying to look as though she wasn't momentarily distraught by her daydream, she started walking faster to catch up to Shinji, who had just plucked a brochure off the wall they were mounted on.  
试图表现得好像并未因白日梦而一时心烦意乱，她加快了脚步追赶真嗣，后者刚刚从他们所贴的墙上取下了一份宣传册。

"So what does this place have exactly," she asked in a tone that she felt was relatively passive.  
“那么这个地方到底有什么呢，”她用一种自认为相对平和的语气问道。

Shinji glanced at her briefly before flipping through the brochure.  
真嗣短暂地瞥了她一眼，然后开始翻阅宣传册。

"A lot really." "真的很多。"

"...So?" "……所以呢？"

"...You'll see." "……你会明白的。"

"Moron," Asuka said annoyingly.  
"傻瓜," 明日香恼怒地说道。

Shinji simply smirked and led the way towards the exhibits.  
真嗣只是微微一笑，领着路向展览区走去。

---

Arrows pointed them further into the museum, during which the faint blue color started to get more profound until they were standing at the top of some stairs that led down into a wide expanse of a room. Along the right hand side of the wall were large tanks filled with water filled with an assortment of rightly colored fish. As Shinji and Asuka started descending the stairs, they looked above them and saw that another aquatic tank was embedded right into the ceiling above them and housed more colorful fish.  
箭头指引他们深入博物馆，期间淡淡的蓝色逐渐变得深邃，直到他们站在通往一个宽阔房间的楼梯顶端。沿着右侧墙壁排列着装满水的大型水箱，里面游弋着各式各样色彩斑斓的鱼。当真嗣和明日香开始下楼梯时，他们抬头望去，发现头顶的天花板上嵌入了一个水族箱，里面同样栖息着五彩缤纷的鱼。

Asuka opened her mouth with surprise at the sheer largeness of this one room. If she was correct in her reckoning, most of the apartment complex they lived in with Misato would have fit quite snugly into this one room.  
看到这个房间的巨大，明日香惊讶得张大了嘴巴。如果她没算错的话，他们和美里住的那整个公寓楼都能很紧凑地塞进这个房间里。

As Asuka was visibly showing her surprise, Shinji said, "This first room is filled with nothing but fish from the Great Barrier Reef...or whats left of it I suppose. Apparently after Second Impact, many coral reefs died off because of the vast change in ocean temperatures."  
看到明日香明显流露出惊讶，真嗣说道：“这第一个房间里全是来自大堡礁的鱼……或者说，剩下的那些。显然，第二次冲击后，许多珊瑚礁因为海洋温度的巨大变化而死亡。”

Turning towards him, Asuka asked with a raised eyebrow, "How do you know that?"  
明日香转向他，挑起眉毛问道：“你怎么知道的？”

"This thing," said Shinji waving the brochure in front of her face.  
"这东西，" 真嗣挥舞着手中的宣传册在她面前。

As Shinji waved it in front of her face, Asuka made a quick swipe for it with her right hand, but came up empty as Shinji was too fast for her.  
当真嗣在她面前挥动宣传册时，明日香迅速用右手去抢，但因为真嗣太快而扑了个空。

Visibly angry at his childish ways, she turned away from him, her brightly colored hair flowing behind her, and stalked off to the far tank on the right side of the room.  
明显对他的幼稚行为感到愤怒，她转身背对他，她那鲜艳的头发在身后飘扬，大步走向房间右侧最远的那个水槽。

Shinji wasn't sure why, but he suddenly felt like laughing. He had to agree with her though, because he was also being absurdly childish. But he felt that he was acting partly because of how she had reacted earlier with the whole couple thing. I mean...maybe it was because she had refused to even think about it, because quite frankly, he wasn't _able_ to think of anything else.  
真嗣不确定为什么，但他突然有种想笑的冲动。不过他不得不承认，自己确实表现得相当幼稚。但他觉得自己的行为部分是因为她之前对整个情侣话题的反应。我是说...也许是因为她拒绝考虑这件事，因为坦白说，他无法再想其他任何事情。

Sighing heavily, Shinji started plodding along the right hand side of the wall, examining the tanks as he went, but always making sure that he kept Asuka in his peripheral vision.  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，开始沿着墙的右侧缓慢前行，一边检查着坦克，一边始终确保阿斯卡在他的视线范围内。

They were distant from each other for a while after this, both a little embarrassed at how they had acted.  
这件事之后，他们之间有一段时间保持着距离，两人都对自己刚才的行为感到有些尴尬。

After the room with the brightly colored fish and the dancing blue lights, the next room couldn't have been more different. When they each walked into the next room, it was first apparent that they weren't walking on the blue carpeting from the previous room, but some sort of reinforced glass. Underneath them, were two baby dolphins that were probably about a fourth the size of an Evangelion's arm. Shinji had to wonder though...how enjoyable it was to have thousands of people starring at you every day while you swam around in something little more than a prison.  
在那个五彩斑斓的鱼群与跳跃的蓝色灯光的房间之后，下一个房间截然不同。当他们各自走进下一个房间时，首先明显感觉到的是，他们脚下的不再是前一个房间的蓝色地毯，而是某种强化玻璃。在他们脚下，是两只大约只有福音战士手臂四分之一大小的海豚宝宝。真嗣不禁思索，每天被成千上万双眼睛盯着，在这样一个狭小的空间里游来游去，究竟有多愉快呢？

Even though both him and Asuka didn't speak to each other about this, they both glanced at each other as the confirming what they each thought. What exactly was the entertainment value in this? It was downright cruel is what they thought.  
尽管他和明日香都没有对此进行交谈，但他们都互相瞥了一眼，确认了彼此的想法。这究竟有什么娱乐价值呢？他们认为，这简直是残忍至极。

They didn't stay very long in the dolphin room, and briefly passed through the next room which housed a single great white shark. They didn't like the idea of thousands of razor sharp teeth mere feet away from them.  
他们在海豚房间停留的时间并不长，很快就匆匆穿过下一个房间，那里只住着一条大白鲨。他们不喜欢那种成千上万锋利牙齿近在咫尺的感觉。

The next room...well wasn't really a room. After the great white shark exhibit, the tour continued through to the next exhibit which happened to be outside. The sun was still high in the sky, but after being in the dark with no light but that eerie blue glow, ninety-six degrees felt pleasant.  
下一个展区……其实算不上真正的房间。在白鲨展馆之后，游览继续延伸至下一个展馆，碰巧是在户外。阳光依旧高悬，但在黑暗中仅有的那抹诡异蓝光之后，九十六度的气温竟显得宜人。

The outside exhibit was much larger as you would expect. As you left the shark exhibit, you would step into the sun, while the carpet had all but disappeared, being replaced with white concrete, porous with many holes. Following the concrete path, you'd walk around in a half circle while a black railing on the right hand side would prevent you from falling over the side and into the freezing water. In the middle of this pool of water was a large structure, designed to look as though it was a large block of ice, though it was the same concrete that you'd been walking on. Situated around this structure, and shooting in and out of the water were of course penguins.  
户外展区比预想的要大得多。离开鲨鱼展馆，你会踏入阳光下，而地毯几乎消失不见，取而代之的是布满孔洞的白色混凝土。沿着混凝土小径，你会绕着半圆行走，右手边的黑色栏杆防止你跌落进冰冷的水中。在这片水域中央，矗立着一个巨大的结构，设计得仿佛一大块冰，尽管它和你脚下的混凝土是同一种材质。围绕着这个结构，穿梭于水面之上的，自然是企鹅们。

As Shinji walked up to the railing his first impression was one of surprise. He knew about Pen-Pen of course, but he didn't think that he'd see other penguins.  
当真嗣走到栏杆前，他的第一印象是惊讶。他当然知道 Pen-Pen，但他没想到会看到其他企鹅。

As Shinji continued watching, a penguin shot out of the water in front of him and did something like a somersault in front of him. Shinji couldn't help smiling as he thought about Pen-Pen's reaction to this.  
当真嗣继续观看时，一只企鹅突然从他面前的水中跃出，在他面前翻了个跟头。真嗣不禁微笑起来，想着 Pen-Pen 对此会有何反应。

Glancing to his left, he saw that a wall of people, some of them couples, separated himself from Asuka. A frown passed over his face as he wondered how much longer this silence was going to continue between them. He wanted to talk to her of course, and he had to assume that she felt the same, but it was almost like he couldn't muster the nerve. Its like a boy that has a crush on a girl and stumbles over his words every time he tries to talk to her. Was that how it was?  
他向左瞥了一眼，看到一堵人墙，其中有些是情侣，将他与明日香隔开。他皱起眉头，想知道这种沉默还要持续多久。当然，他想和她说话，他不得不假设她也有同样的感觉，但几乎就像他鼓不起勇气一样。就像一个暗恋女孩的男孩，每次试图和她说话时都会结巴。情况是这样吗？

Shinji didn't really think so. He'd like to think that his and Asuka's relationship wasn't a simple crush, as childish as the thought of it seemed to him. But he still liked her, couldn't get the image of her face out of his head for that matter. And then there was of course what he had done earlier.  
真嗣并不这么认为。他宁愿相信他和明日香的关系不仅仅是简单的迷恋，尽管这个想法在他看来显得很幼稚。但他仍然喜欢她，无法将她的面容从脑海中抹去。当然，还有他之前所做的事情。

What had he thought when he had kissed her forehead? ...Nothing really, it had just seemed so normal, almost right in some way. Then did he have feelings for her...or had he had feelings for her long before this, and they were only now starting to surface? A nagging suspicion in the back of Shinji's own head told him this last part was true. But then should anything change? But he didn't _want_ anything to change. Things were perfectly fine the way they were.  
当他吻她的额头时，他心里想了些什么？……其实什么也没想，那动作似乎再自然不过，甚至有几分恰当。那么，他对她有感情吗……或者早在此时之前，他就已经对她有了感情，只是现在才开始浮现？在真嗣的内心深处，有个声音不断提醒他，最后这一点是真的。但这样一来，事情是否应该有所改变？可他并不希望有任何改变。一切现状都完美无缺。

'Are they really?' he thought. 'How much longer are you both going to keep deluding yourselves? Until what you had is long lost, and you start to regret the decisions you made? Enjoy the time you have together, for it may be just like the sun overhead...a fleeting moment in the wide expanse of the sky...'  
“真的如此吗？”他暗自思忖，“你们还要自欺欺人到何时？直到曾经拥有的一切消逝无踪，才开始后悔当初的决定吗？珍惜你们共度的时光吧，因为那或许就像头顶的太阳……在广阔天空中转瞬即逝的一刻……”

This last part sounded a lot like something Rebecca would have said, as though she was standing right next to him and telling him this. But she wasn't, and as much as he admired her, he couldn't turn to her for this.  
这番话听起来很像丽贝卡会说的话，仿佛她就站在他身边，对他娓娓道来。但她并不在，尽管他敬佩她，却无法在这件事上求助于她。

Almost at this very thought, the sun finally clouded over, as though foreboding times to come...  
几乎就在这个念头闪过的瞬间，太阳终于被云层遮蔽，仿佛预示着即将到来的不祥时光……

---

Though it never did rain, it became overcast quickly, and soon it felt that all the happiness was sucked out of the world in the instance that the sun left.  
虽然雨始终没有下，但天空很快变得阴沉，不久便感觉太阳消失的那一刻，世界上的所有快乐都被抽走了。

After leaving the penguin exhibit, there was a short break that people could take at some picnic bench's where you could eat food that you had brought, or order food at the nearby shop. Having eaten just under an hour ago, Shinji and Asuka saw no reason to even consider sitting down, but through there glances towards each other, they knew that they had something to resolve.  
离开企鹅展区后，人们可以在一些野餐桌旁稍作休息，那里可以吃自带的食物，或者在附近的商店点餐。由于一小时前刚吃过饭，真嗣和明日香觉得没有理由坐下来，但通过彼此的眼神交流，他们知道有些事情需要解决。

Choosing a spot aways away from everyone else, they plopped down on a picnic bench and sat across from each other, while cherry blossoms fell around them from a nearby tree. If not for the topic of discussion, it would have been fairly romantic.  
他们选择了一个远离人群的地方，一屁股坐在野餐桌旁，面对面坐着，周围是附近一棵樱花树上飘落的樱花。如果不是因为讨论的话题，这场景本可以相当浪漫。

Asuka started first, wordlessly putting her chin in the palm of her hand and resting her arm on the bench as though saying, 'Well? What do you want to say?'  
明日香率先开口，无言地将下巴搁在手掌上，手臂搭在长椅上，仿佛在说：‘那么？你想说什么？’

Shinji who had been looking at a point just over her shoulder hesitated momentarily, but seemed to hold himself together as he said, "I don't want things to be like this...this silence; its too painful."  
一直盯着她肩膀上方某处的真嗣犹豫了一下，但似乎还是稳住了自己，说道：“我不想这样……这种沉默；太痛苦了。”

Asuka let out a low, 'Hmph,' in response, though Shinji was at least glad she had listened.  
明日香低声哼了一声作为回应，尽管至少真嗣很高兴她听了进去。

Continuing, he said, "Look, I'm sorry for what I did earlier...it was stupid and childish."  
他继续说道，"听着，我为我之前做的事道歉...那很愚蠢也很幼稚。"

"Idiot," Asuka harshly said back.  
“笨蛋，”明日香严厉地回敬道。

Shinji winced at this but didn't retort back, she was technically right.  
真嗣对此皱了皱眉，但没有反驳，她的确说得没错。

After waiting a few seconds Shinji said, "...I don't want to lose what we have Asuka..."  
等了几秒钟后，真嗣说道：“……我不想失去我们之间的东西，明日香……”

It was this last part that made Asuka finally look at him, and when she did she felt that she had suddenly swallowed ten butterflies and they were now fluttering around in her stomach. Shinji was sincere, truly sincere about how he felt and that he didn't want to lose the bond that they had developed. Well that was exactly how Asuka felt as well. But even so...just the look on Shinji's face of remorse made Asuka want to throw herself at him and tell him she forgave him. Unfortunately being out in public as they were, her normal abrasive behavior kicked in and she instead said-  
正是这最后一点，让明日香终于看向他，而当她这么做时，她感觉自己仿佛突然吞下了十只蝴蝶，它们现在正在她的胃里扑腾。真嗣是真诚的，他真心实意地表达了自己的感受，以及他不想失去他们之间建立的纽带。好吧，明日香也是这么想的。但即便如此……仅仅是真嗣脸上那悔恨的表情，就让明日香想要扑向他，告诉他她原谅了他。不幸的是，他们身处公共场合，她平时的尖锐行为又占了上风，于是她反而说道——

"Fine, I'll forgive you."  
“好吧，我原谅你了。”

Shinji's face relaxed immensely and he was about to saying something else when Asuka cut in.  
真嗣的脸色顿时放松了许多，正要再说些什么，却被明日香打断了。

"But...you're gonna have to make up for it by buying me something at the gift shop."  
“但是……你得在礼品店给我买点东西作为补偿。”

"No problem," said Shinji hurriedly. Honestly, he didn't care if Asuka wanted him to buy the whole store, anything to just gain back her trust.  
"没问题，" 真嗣急忙说道。老实说，他并不在乎明日香是否要他把整个店都买下来，只要能重新赢得她的信任，什么都行。

"So whats next then?" asked Asuka in a friendly tone, as though there past argument had all been a hallucination.  
"那接下来呢？" 明日香友好地问道，仿佛他们之前的争吵都只是幻觉。

"Umm...after the penguin exhibit I think there's a polar bear one...and then some fish from other parts of the world. I think theres some video at the end also, where it talks about Second Impact and how its affected each animal at the aquarium."  
"嗯...看完企鹅展区后，我想接下来是北极熊展区...然后是来自世界各地的鱼类。最后还有一段视频，讲述第二次冲击以及它如何影响水族馆里的每一种动物。"

"We can skip that. It'll be the same bull shit that governments have been feeding the general public anyway."  
"我们可以跳过那个。反正政府也一直在用那些陈词滥调糊弄大众。"

"...I suppose." "...我想也是。"

Asuka was somewhat surprise at the reluctance in his voice and asked, "Why, did you want to watch it?"  
明日香对他的犹豫感到有些惊讶，问道：“怎么，你想看吗？”

"Not really...but." The thought of sitting with you in a dark room isn't so bad, though he'd never come right out and say that.  
"并不完全是...不过。和你一起坐在黑暗的房间里，这想法倒也不坏，尽管他绝不会直截了当地说出来。

"Well if you don't have a reason then theres no point to watch it," said Asuka as she stood up.  
"既然你没有理由，那看它就没有意义了，" 明日香说着站起身来。

"Right," replied Shinji distractedly.  
"嗯，" 真嗣心不在焉地回答道。

Standing up also, he looked across at her for a moment, before Asuka turned away from him with a slight smile on her face, and started walking back towards the path they had left.  
他也站起身来，目光越过她片刻，随后明日香微微一笑，转身离开，开始走回他们离开的那条小径。

As Shinji watched her leave, his head was suddenly assaulted by a brief vision of her walking into a blinding white light with her back turned towards him, but he brushed it off. It wasn't like one of his normal visions anyway, just something his mind thought of on the spur of the moment, and he realized at that moment how much she really meant to him.  
当真嗣看着她离去时，脑海中突然闪现出她背对着他走进一片刺目白光的短暂幻象，但他很快将其抛诸脑后。这毕竟不像他平常的那些预感，只是心血来潮时脑海中浮现的画面，然而那一刻他意识到她对他意味着多么重要。

'We'll stay together,' he thought. 'We'll stay together until the world ends...and even after.'  
“我们会在一起，”他心想，“我们会一直在一起，直到世界终结……甚至在那之后。”

Shinji hurried after her then, without a second thought to what he had thought momentarily ago, not knowing how right his thought was.  
真嗣急忙跟在她后面，没有再考虑片刻之前他那一闪而过的念头，不知道那个念头是多么正确。

Above them, the sun came out from behind the clouds, but the clouds lingered thereafter.  
在他们上方，太阳从云层后露出了脸，但云朵依旧徘徊不去。

---

The exhibit for the polar bears was much like the one that housed the penguins, though much larger, and a viewing room was placed under the water for when the polar bears dove in. Unfortunately for Shinji and Asuka, the polar bears weren't nearly as active as the penguins, and slept soundly on the hard concrete structure in the middle of the water. Shinji supposed even concrete felt fine for sleeping on...if you had a mane of fur as a pillow.  
北极熊的展区与企鹅的展区颇为相似，只是规模更大，水下还设有一个观景室，供游客观赏北极熊潜水时的情景。遗憾的是，对于真嗣和明日香来说，北极熊远不如企鹅活跃，它们在水中硬邦邦的水泥结构上酣睡。真嗣想，即便是水泥，如果你有一圈厚厚的毛皮当枕头，睡起来也会很舒服吧。

The next was the same as the first, though without the brightly colored fish. They were largely a dull grey color with a few light shades of pink mixed in, though Shinji thought he saw one with a pointed nose.  
接下来的一幕与最初相似，只是没有了色彩斑斓的鱼。它们大多呈现单调的灰色，夹杂着几抹淡淡的粉色，尽管如此，真嗣觉得自己看到了一只尖鼻子的。

As they left this last room, they both briefly glanced at the door leading into the makeshift theatre where the video was presented.  
当他们离开这最后一间房时，两人都短暂地瞥了一眼通向临时剧场的那扇门，那里正播放着视频。

"Wanna take a guess at how many Americans are in there?" asked Asuka.  
“想猜猜里面有多少美国人吗？”明日香问道。

"After all this walking...I'd guess that theres fifty Americans, six Europeans, and a lone Chinese man."  
毕竟走了这么久...我猜这里有五十个美国人，六个欧洲人，还有一个孤独的中国人。

Asuka had to stifle her laughter as a family with two kids went by them, glancing at Shinji and Asuka as they passed.  
当一个带着两个孩子的家庭从他们身边经过，瞥了瞥真嗣和明日香时，明日香不得不强忍住笑意。

"So then...gift shop?" asked Shinji after the family went by.  
“那么...礼品店？”真嗣在那家人走过后问道。

Looking towards him, Asuka nodded and said, "Yeah, because you're gonna buy me something, and it better not be a cheap keychain or some shit."  
望向他，明日香点头说道：“嗯，因为你得给我买东西，而且最好别是什么廉价钥匙扣之类的垃圾。”

"I'll keep it in mind," thought Shinji, who had briefly thought of that very thing.  
“我会记住的，”真嗣心想，他刚才确实短暂地考虑过那个主意。

Turning towards there left instead of the right, which was where the theatre was, they followed a hallway with many signs and pictures of marine wildlife taken apparently by well known photographers. As they reached the exit sign, Shinji thought he heard Asuka mutter a barely audible, "Finally." He understood what she meant and couldn't really blame her, it certainly hadn't been the best time they'd ever had.  
他们转向左边而不是右边，因为剧院在右边，他们沿着一条走廊走去，走廊上挂满了由知名摄影师拍摄的海洋生物照片和指示牌。当他们走到出口标志时，真嗣觉得他听到明日香低声咕哝了一句“终于”。他理解她的意思，确实，这绝不是他们经历过的最愉快的时光。

As they entered the gift shop it was clear just how right Shinji's assumption that most people had stopped at the theatre first and he was glad he had listened to Asuka. Just them two and another teenage couple were standing inside the small gift shop. Shinji couldn't imagine what it would have been like with fifty plus people in there.  
当他们走进礼品店时，事实证明真嗣的猜测完全正确——大多数人都是先到剧院，这让他庆幸自己听了明日香的话。小小的礼品店里，只有他们俩和另一对青少年情侣。真嗣难以想象如果五十多个人挤在里面会是什么情景。

Turning to Asuka, he asked, "Do you want to choose something, or should I?"  
他转向明日香，问道：“你想挑点什么，还是我来？”

Asuka tried to act as though this was a difficult decision, even though she had long ago decided.  
明日香故作艰难地思考，尽管她早已心中有数。

"You decide...surprise me, and make it good. I don't want something cheap as compensation."  
"你决定吧...给我个惊喜，要好的。我不想要什么廉价的补偿。"

"Look around a bit, and then wait outside...I'll be out shortly."  
"四处看看，然后在外面等我...我很快就会出来。"

Asuka raised an eyebrow in surprise. "You sound as though he already have something in mind..."  
明日香惊讶地挑了挑眉。"你听起来好像已经有什么主意了..."

"Not really," said Shinji lamely, making it all to obvious that he did. In fact, the moment they entered the shop, his eyes had been drawn to a specific thing.  
“不太算吧，”真嗣无力地回答，显然他确实有想法。事实上，他们一进店，他的目光就被某样东西吸引住了。

"Okay then," said Asuka slowly. Next second she looked wildly around, looking at all the things Shinji might have decided to get her.  
“那好吧，”明日香缓缓说道。下一秒她便四处张望，寻找着真嗣可能为她挑选的礼物。

After looking over a necklace that was set with bright blue stones that supposedly reflected the suns rays, she gave up and went outside to wait patiently.  
在仔细打量了一条镶嵌着据说能反射阳光的亮蓝色宝石的项链后，她放弃了，走到外面耐心等待。

After making sure that she really had left, Shinji walked over to the counter where the cashier stood and asked, "How much for those?" He said this while pointing at two exact objects that were sitting on a cushion inside a glass case behind the counter.  
确认她真的离开后，真嗣走向收银台，那里站着一位收银员，他问道：“这些多少钱？”说话间，他指向柜台后玻璃柜内垫子上摆放的两件完全相同的物品。

"Ah one of our more popular items with young couples. Imported all the way from France, woo your beloved with these lovely golden-"  
“啊，这是我们年轻情侣中颇受欢迎的商品。从法国远道而来，用这些可爱的金色——”

"Can I just know the price?" repeated Shinji.  
“我只想知道价格。”真嗣重复道。

"-and lets not forget about the blue eyes, embedded with a precious stone found only off the coasts of Hawaii-"  
"-而且别忘了那双蓝眼睛，镶嵌着一颗仅在夏威夷海岸外才能找到的珍贵宝石-"

"The price," Shinji said, putting a little more force than he had intended in his voice.  
"价格，" 真嗣说道，不自觉地加重了语气。"

"Ah yes the price," said the cashier who seemed to not have noticed Shinji the first few times. "This can be yours for a very reasonable price of twenty US dollars."  
"啊，是的，价格，" 收银员似乎前几次都没注意到真嗣。"这个你可以以非常合理的二十美元价格拥有。"

"I'm Japanese in case you didn't realize," said Shinji, becoming increasingly annoyed.  
"我是日本人，如果你还没意识到的话，" 真嗣说道，越来越恼火。

"Of course you are...now are you buying or-"  
"当然你是...现在你是要买还是——"

"Yes I'm buying." Shinji refrained from adding on, 'damn it,' at the end of his sentence.  
"是的，我要买。" 真嗣忍住了在句子末尾加上，'该死的，'。

"Splendid! Now, is this for a special someone of yours, because if it is I can wrap it up nice and neat for a healthy price of-"  
"太棒了！这是给特别的人准备的吗？如果是的话，我可以把它包装得既美观又整洁，只要一个合理的价格——"

'Did this guy live in England for a few years?' wondered Shinji.  
'这家伙在英国住过几年吗？' 真嗣心想。

"Yes, wrap it up and...whatever," said Shinji, cutting across the mans rant.  
"是的，包起来吧，随便什么，" 真嗣打断了那人的唠叨。

"Al-righty then I'll have it all wrapped up in a minute and you can be on your-"  
"好了，马上就全部打包好，你就可以离开了-"

"Thank God," mumbled Shinji.  
"谢天谢地，" 真嗣喃喃自语道。

---

Asuka was disgusted by herself, or rather at the way she was feeling right now as she leaned against a tree just outside the gift shop exit. Unfortunately she couldn't see or hear Shinji from where she stood and wouldn't be surprised if even he couldn't have known what was going on in the shop if in her position.  
明日香对自己感到厌恶，更确切地说，是她此刻倚靠在礼品店出口外一棵树上的感觉让她作呕。不幸的是，她无法看到或听到真嗣，如果换作是她站在店里，她也不会惊讶于他是否能知道店里发生了什么。

Really why had she asked him to buy her a gift, it was a stupid decision on her part. Or did she just want something to remember the time spent with him today? She was acting as though this was a date for them, and even though she had said, 'Sure why not,' she hadn't actually meant it. She had just been humoring Shinji. Now though, it did feel like a real date to her.  
真的，她为什么要让他给她买礼物呢？这完全是她自己的愚蠢决定。还是说她只是想留下今天和他共度时光的纪念？她表现得好像这是他们的一场约会，尽管她说过“当然可以”，但实际上她并没有那个意思。她只是在迁就真嗣。但现在，这确实让她感觉像是一场真正的约会。

How was she supposed to react when he came back with some gift? Should she act happy? Excited? Or should she be passive until she discovers what it was he bought her. Surely if wasn't that necklace she had looked at. She knew she said to not buy her some cheap junk, but she hoped Shinji hadn't bought her some eighty dollar necklace. She would feel bad about something like that.  
当他带着礼物回来时，她应该如何反应呢？她应该表现得开心吗？兴奋吗？还是应该保持被动，直到发现他买了什么给她。当然，不会是她看过的那条项链吧。她知道她说过不要买些廉价的东西给她，但她希望真嗣没有买一条八十美元的项链。她会因为那样的事情感到内疚。

As she thought this, she suddenly saw him walking towards her out of the blue.  
正当她这么想着，突然间，她看到他毫无预兆地向她走来。

'How the hell does he do that,' she wondered as she watched him draw closer.  
“他到底是怎么做到的？”她一边想，一边看着他越走越近。

"Took you long enough," she said as he got nearer, falling back on her usual behavior.  
“你可算来了，”她在他走近时说道，恢复了平时的举止。

"Sorry, the cashier was rather talkative."  
“抱歉，收银员挺能聊的。”

"Whatever...so, what did you get me?" she said trying to not act too excited.  
“随便啦...那你给我买了什么？”她尽量不让自己显得太兴奋。

In response, Shinji brought a hand that had been resting in his pocket out, and held out a small package in the palm of his hand. It was a case, simple enough, the kind you'd keep a ring in when not wearing it. However, it was still surprising enough for Asuka to have to stifle a gasp with her hand.  
作为回应，真嗣从口袋里抽出一只手，掌心托着一个精致的小盒子。那是一个简简单单的首饰盒，平时用来存放戒指的那种。尽管如此，它还是让明日香惊讶得不得不用手捂住差点脱口而出的惊呼。

"I saw it when we first walked in and thought...well open first I guess."  
“我们刚进来时我就看到了，想着...嗯，还是先打开看看吧。”

Throwing off the facade she normally wore, Asuka took it wordlessly and glanced at it for a moment before saying to Shinji, "Look, if you spent to much on this go in and give it back. I didn't really mean when I told you I wanted something expensive. Anything will be find, so just-"  
抛开平日里的伪装，明日香默默接过礼物，瞥了一眼后对真嗣说：“听着，如果你在这上面花了太多钱，就进去退掉吧。我之前说想要贵重的东西，并不是那个意思。其实什么都行，只要……”

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"What!" she snapped back without meaning to.  
“什么！”她不自觉地厉声回道。

"Open it..." “打开它……”

"But-" "但——"

"Forget about the price and open it."  
"别管价格了，打开它。"

Asuka frowned at him and bit her lip silently.  
明日香皱着眉头看着他，默默地咬了咬嘴唇。

"Oh fine. If you insist."  
"好吧。既然你坚持。"

And so she opened it.  
于是她打开了它。

Her face didn't really change at all for the first few seconds, but slowly a look of surprised astonishment showed on her face.  
起初她的表情几乎没有变化，但渐渐地，脸上露出了惊讶至极的神情。

"Shinji...this-" “真嗣...这——”

"As I said...I saw it when we first went in, but wasn't sure if you'd be able to wear them or not."  
"正如我所说...我们第一次进去时我就看到了，但不确定你是否能戴它们。"

"...No, I can," she whispered quietly.  
"...不，我可以，"她轻声细语地回答。"

Slowly reaching into the case, she drew out two golden earrings, both in the shape of dolphins with eyes that gleamed blue like the ocean. Holding both of them in the palm of her hand she blinked several times as she felt tears starting to well at the corners of her eyes.  
她缓缓地把手伸进盒子里，取出两只金色的耳环，形状都是海豚，眼睛闪烁着如海洋般的蓝色光芒。她将它们握在掌心，眨了几次眼，感觉到眼角开始涌出泪水。

"Shinji...I mean...its great but..."  
"真嗣...我是说...这很好，但是..."

"If you don't like it I can take them back and get them returned, and then-"  
"如果你不喜欢，我可以拿回去退掉，然后-"

"No its not that...but it is, I mean...you shouldn't have gotten me this."  
"不，不是那样的...但也确实是，我是说...你不该给我买这个的。"

"Why not? You said that you can wear them so I'm guessing your ears are pierced."  
"为什么不呢？你说过你可以戴它们，所以我猜你的耳朵是打过耳洞的。"

"No, thats fine. I got those done a long time ago. Its just...do I really deserve something like this?"  
"不，那没问题。我很久以前就打过耳洞了。只是...我真的配得上这样的东西吗？"

"What?" "什么？"

"I don't like it," she whispered. "I'm always mean to you and yet you put up with me all the time and here you just bought me...one of the best gifts I've ever gotten."  
"我不喜欢这样，"她低声说。"我总是对你刻薄，而你却一直忍受着我，现在你还给我买了...这是我收到过的最好的礼物之一。"

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"I'm serious. Why should you do this for me?"  
"我是认真的。你为什么要为我这么做？"

"Because I value our relationship."  
"因为我珍视我们的关系。"

Asuka opened her mouth and closed it wordlessly. Looking back at Shinji, her face gleaming in the sun from the tears no longer held back she said, "Thank you..."  
明日香张开嘴，又默默地合上了。她回头看着真嗣，泪水不再抑制，阳光下她的脸庞闪耀着光芒，她说道，"谢谢你..."

Shinji opened his mouth to say, 'Your welcome,' when Asuka took several steps forward and practically fell into Shinji's chest. There height was never more profound as it was in this moment, and if Asuka didn't know any better, she would have guessed that Shinji had grown several more inches since last time they had been this intimate with each other. Her head came to just below his neck line so that if she were to look up, his lips would be a second away from hers. There bodies were perfectly alined as they stood like that, with her head resting against his chest, silent tears still streaming down her face while her hands she kept pressed against the soft fabric of the shirt he was wearing. Shinji on the other hand still stood surprised at her sudden forwardness. Slowly though, the situation seemed to dawn on him, and both hands rose from his side and wrapped around Asuka's back, pulling her closer to him. Asuka didn't even relent to this new closeness, and the hands that she had pressed against the cloth of his shirt, suddenly grabbed the shirt and entwined themselves in the cloth, as though finding comfort in the fact that all that separated her skin from his was a thin layer of cloth. Shinji then looked down at the girl who only knew how to express herself through her actions and buried his face in her hair, enjoying her unique smell as it filled his nostrils, and the feel of her silky hair as it passed over his lips. Asuka let out a small sigh into the fabric of his shirt as her eyes started drying, pressing herself further against Shinji trying to get the feeling of how happy she was across to him. All in all, they felt as though they were floating on cloud nine.  
真嗣张口想说“不客气”，就在这时，明日香向前迈了几步，几乎是扑进了真嗣的怀里。这一刻，他们的身高差显得尤为明显，如果明日香没有记错，她会以为真嗣自上次如此亲密以来又长高了几英寸。她的头刚好抵在他的颈线下方，只要她抬头，他的唇就离她的仅一秒之遥。他们的身体完美地贴合在一起，她的头靠在他的胸前，无声的泪水依旧顺着脸颊流淌，而她的双手紧贴着他衬衫柔软的布料。真嗣则仍因她的突然举动而愣在原地。不过渐渐地，他似乎明白了状况，双手从身侧抬起，环抱住明日香的后背，将她更紧地拥入怀中。 明日香对此新的亲近丝毫没有退缩，她原本按在他衬衫布料上的双手，突然抓住衬衫并缠绕在布料中，仿佛在寻找安慰，因为隔在她皮肤和他之间的只是一层薄薄的布料。真嗣随后低头看着这个只能通过行动表达自己的女孩，将脸埋进她的发丝中，享受着她独特的香气充盈鼻腔，以及她丝滑的发丝掠过唇边的感觉。明日香对着他的衬衫面料发出一声轻微的叹息，她的眼睛开始干涸，她更紧地贴向真嗣，试图将她的快乐感受传递给他。总的来说，他们感觉自己仿佛飘在九霄云外。

"You're welcome," Shinji finally managed to whisper, his face still buried in Asuka's hair. Asuka mumbled something inaudible as she shifted her head against Shinji's chest, finding a more comfortable spot to lean against.  
“不客气。”真嗣终于低声说道，他的脸仍埋在明日香的发间。明日香咕哝着什么听不清的话，她将头靠在真嗣的胸前，寻找一个更舒适的倚靠点。

Its probably a good thing that there was a hard concrete walkway next to them, because if given the chance, and a bed, they probably would have fallen down like that, there bodies still entwined. Be that as it may, something possibly better happened to interrupt them.  
幸好他们旁边有一条坚硬的水泥走道，因为如果有机会，再加上一张床，他们很可能会那样倒下，身体依旧缠绵。尽管如此，可能有什么更好的事情打断了他们。

"Err Asuka...Shinji. What are you guys doing?"  
“呃……明日香……真嗣。你们在干什么？”

Neither of them really recognized the voice at first, still too absorbed in the moment to give a damn about anything else when another voice spoke up.  
起初他们都没有认出那个声音，仍然沉浸在那一刻，对其他事情毫不在意，这时另一个声音响起。

"I told you something like this would happen." This last voice almost sounded as though it was holding back a laugh.  
"我就说这种事迟早会发生。" 这最后一句话几乎听起来像是在忍住笑。

"You can't really blame them," said another, male this time. "They haven't had anytime by themselves recently.  
"你不能真的怪他们，" 另一个声音说道，这次是个男声。"他们最近都没时间独处。

It was this last voice which got both Shinji and Asuka to turn around, though it was oddly funny. Both of them simply turned there heads, still not letting go of the other and almost fell over at the sight of the three people who were standing there in shorts watching them.  
正是这最后一句话让真嗣和明日香转过身来，虽然这情景颇为滑稽。两人只是转过头，依然没有放开对方，看到站在那里穿着短裤的三个人时，差点摔倒。

"Well, I suppose I can't say I'm honestly surprised since I was expecting something like this," said Misato who had sun glasses on her head.  
“嗯，我想我不能说我真的很惊讶，因为我预料到会有这样的事情，”戴着太阳镜的美里说道。

"But to think we'd meet them at a place like this," said Ritsuko this time, chuckling a little bit.  
“但没想到我们会在这样的地方遇到他们，”这次是律子说道，轻声笑了一下。

"Ah to be young again," replied Kaji. "Reminds me of our college days Misato."  
“啊，真想再年轻一次，”加持回答道，“让我想起了我们大学时代的美里。”

Misato openly threw him a dirty look and turned back to the two teenagers, still gripping each other and not really registering what was happening.  
美里毫不掩饰地给了他一个白眼，然后转回那两个紧紧相拥的少年少女，他们似乎还没完全意识到发生了什么。

"Well you're young and it happens to everyone so I suppose I can-"  
“好吧，你们还年轻，这种事谁都会遇到，我想我可以——”

Misato was cut short however when Asuka's hands that had seconds ago been holding onto Shinji's shirt in a way that suggested deep affection, suddenly jerked backwards and slammed into Shinji chest, knocking the wind out of him and sending him spiraling backwards.  
然而，美里的话还没说完，刚才还紧紧抓着真嗣衬衫、显得深情款款的明日香的手，突然猛地向后一拉，重重地击打在真嗣的胸口，让他一口气没喘上来，整个人向后倒去。

"Wha-Wha-Wha-What are you doing you pervert?" she stammered nervously as the warmth between them disappeared in an instance. Asuka was completely unaware that she still held the earrings in her hand, nor that the corners of her eyes were starting to water again.  
“你、你、你、你在干什么，变态？”她紧张地结巴着，两人之间的温暖瞬间消失。明日香完全没有意识到自己手里还握着耳环，也没有注意到眼角又开始泛起泪光。

In response, Shinji glanced behind himself at the trio who had interrupted them and frowned, as though it was entirely there faults.  
对此，真嗣回头瞥了一眼打断他们的三人，皱起眉头，仿佛这一切都是他们的错。

Meanwhile, Misato and the other two were starting to feign ignorance over Asuka's delayed reaction to being seen like that with Shinji.  
与此同时，美里和其他两人开始装作对明日香被看到和真嗣那样亲密的迟钝反应一无所知。

"So, what are you doing here?" asked Shinji, clearly grumpy about present conditions. Behind him, Asuka looked as though she'd like nothing more than to sink into the ground.  
"那么，你在这里做什么？" 真嗣问道，显然对当前的情况感到不悦。在他身后，明日香看起来恨不得能钻进地里。

"Some research on how marine animals have adapted to a harsher environment," replied Ritsuko.  
"关于海洋生物如何适应更恶劣环境的调查研究，" 律子回答道。

"Sounds fascinating," said Shinji, sarcasm only too obvious.  
"听起来真有趣，" 真嗣说道，讽刺之意再明显不过。

"Were you two on a date?" Misato finally managed to blurt out, causing both Kaji and Ritsuko to look at her rather surprised. Shinji was about to shrug as though it was whatever she thought, when Asuka hurriedly spoke up.  
"你们俩是在约会吗？" 美里终于忍不住脱口而出，让加治和律子都颇为惊讶地看着她。真嗣正要耸耸肩，仿佛她怎么想都无所谓，这时明日香急忙开口。

"Absolutely not! No way! I just dragged him around as compensation for...for annoying me, about some things."  
"绝对不是！不可能！我只是拉着他到处走，作为...因为某些事情惹我生气的补偿。"

"Then whats that in your hand?" asked Misato suspiciously.  
“那你的手里是什么？”美里怀疑地问道。

"What this?" Asuka responded, looking at the earrings, "Just some cheap souvenir that I made Shinji buy for me."  
“这个吗？”明日香回答，看着耳环，“只是我让真嗣买给我的便宜纪念品。”

Shinji openly flinched at that, but only Asuka seemed to notice, whereas Misato didn't look as though she believed her in the slightest.  
真嗣听到这话明显退缩了一下，但只有明日香注意到了，而美里看起来一点儿也不相信她的话。

"A huh...well just don't stay out too late, and don't forget that you're returning to Nerv and not my apartment."  
"啊哈...好吧，别太晚回来，别忘了你是回 NERV 而不是我的公寓。"

"Right," said Shinji, trying to keep the anger in his voice in check. Misato seemed to notice though and tried giving him a weak smile which turned into a grimace.  
"好的，" 真嗣说道，努力控制着声音中的怒气。美里似乎察觉到了，试图给他一个虚弱的微笑，却变成了苦笑。

"See you two back at Nerv then..."  
"那我们 NERV 见..."

"Yeah see ya," responded Shinji.  
“嗯，再见。”真嗣回应道。

As Misato and Ritsuko passed Shinji, Kaji paused for a moment, clapped him on the shoulder and whispered in his ear, "Trust when I say I know the feeling of being interrupted like this. Don't let it bother you too much though."  
当美里和律子经过真嗣时，加持停顿了一下，拍了拍他的肩膀并在他耳边低语：“相信我，我知道这种被打断的感觉。不过别让它太困扰你。”

He didn't even bother responding, shrugging Kaji's hand off his shoulder and digging his hands deep into his pockets.  
他甚至懒得回应，耸了耸肩甩开加持的手，将双手深深插进口袋里。

Kaji frowned at the adolescent in front of him, hoping that he wouldn't make the same mistake he did when he was a teenager, before he nodded his head slightly, and walked towards a door that Misato and Ritsuko had disappeared through marked with, 'authorized personal only,' plastered above the door frame.  
加治皱眉看着眼前的少年，希望他不会重蹈自己青春期的覆辙，随后微微点头，走向了美里和律子消失的那扇门，门框上贴着醒目的标语：‘仅限授权人员’。

After Kaji left, nothing remained but a frosty like atmosphere in which both Shinji and Asuka were absorbed in their own thoughts. Eventually though, Shinji started walking towards a sign that read exit and would take him out on the streets of Tokyo-3, his hands still deep in his pockets and his pointed towards the ground.  
加治离开后，只剩下一片冰冷的氛围，真嗣和明日香各自沉浸在自己的思绪中。最终，真嗣开始走向标有出口的指示牌，那将带他来到第三新东京市的街头，双手依旧深插在口袋里，头低垂着。

Seeing what he was doing, Asuka took several steps towards him when she paused and waited until he was a good distance ahead of her before she started walking. After the way she had reacted, she could understand if Shinji didn't want to talk with her, and respected his wishes...even if they were painful.  
看到他的举动，明日香朝他迈了几步，随即停下，等他走远一些后才开始跟随。考虑到她之前的反应，她能理解如果真嗣不想和她说话，并尊重他的意愿……即便这让她感到痛苦。

As Shinji stepped onto the streets of Tokyo-3, he looked both ways, trying to decide which way would most likely burn the rest of the day away. He felt empty right now, more empty than he had felt in a long time. It wasn't so much being interrupted that bothered him, but how reluctant Asuka had been to be seen with him like that by other people, and specifically, people she knew. Then there was what she had said about the earrings he had gotten her. He was angry when he didn't want to be, but he was, and it bothered him that he was angry at her. Right now he didn't want to talk, even though he could sense the fall of her foot steps behind him. He was afraid that he'd fly off the handle and hurt her...in an emotional way. He'd sooner cut his own arm off with his AT-field than cause her physical harm. Maybe later they could talk...but not right now.  
当真嗣踏上第三新东京市的街道时，他左右张望，试图决定哪条路能最有可能消磨掉剩下的这一天。此刻他感到空虚，比很久以来任何时候都要空虚。让他烦恼的并非被打断，而是明日香在与他一起时，对被其他人——特别是她认识的人——看到的抗拒态度。还有她对他送给她的耳环所说的话。他本不想生气，却还是生气了，这让他对自己生她的气感到烦恼。此刻他不想说话，尽管他能感觉到她跟在身后的脚步声。他害怕自己会失控，以情感的方式伤害她……他宁愿用 AT 力场切断自己的手臂，也不愿对她造成身体上的伤害。也许晚些时候他们可以谈谈……但不是现在。

As Shinji turned a corner, he glanced around, trying to pick out where he was located in Tokyo-3. He had been almost everywhere in the city in his relatively short time in Tokyo-3, and could recognize where he was almost immediately, but right now he just let his feet take him where ever they pleased.  
当真嗣转过一个拐角时，他环顾四周，试图辨认自己在第三新东京市的位置。在他相对短暂的停留期间，他几乎走遍了这座城市的每个角落，几乎能立刻认出自己的位置，但此刻他只是任由双脚带他去任何它们想去的地方。

And so it was that they returned to there first encounter.  
于是，他们回到了初次相遇的地方。

---

Though relatively different from how it had been before, it was technically still the same as Shinji gazed out across the beach from where he had first seen Asuka those many months ago. The sun wouldn't set for another five hours at best, but Shinji felt as though waiting wouldn't be such a bad idea.  
虽然与之前相比有了些许不同，但从技术上讲，一切依旧如故。真嗣凝视着海滩，那里是他几个月前第一次见到明日香的地方。太阳至少还要五个小时才会落山，但真嗣觉得等待并不是什么坏事。

Following along the edge of the hill, he reached the cement staircase and started climbing down to the sandy beach below. Small pieces of driftwood littered the beach along with smoothly shaped stones, but other than that little else was on the beach. Shinji was glad that people had refrained from littering on it. It was something of a special spot for him, both for the first time he saw Asuka, and also for the time they fought there first angel together.  
他沿着山坡边缘前行，来到了水泥楼梯前，开始向下走向下面的沙滩。沙滩上散落着小块的浮木和形状圆润的石头，除此之外别无他物。真嗣很高兴人们没有在这里乱扔垃圾。这个地方对他来说意义非凡，既是第一次见到明日香的地方，也是他们共同对抗第一个使徒的战场。

Looking out towards the ocean, he watched as wave upon wave crashed towards the shore before slowly dissipating to almost nothing. In some ways, it reminded him of his own life.  
他望向大海，看着一波又一波的浪花拍击着岸边，随后缓缓消散，几乎归于无形。在某种程度上，这让他想起了自己的生活。

Suddenly a strong sea breeze hit him, sending his hair whipping around his face as the smell of salt filled his nostrils. Above him, the sun was still burning a hole through the ozone layer, sending waves of heat onto the back of his neck, but the sea breeze felt nice and cool at least.  
突然，一阵强劲的海风袭来，吹得他的头发在脸颊上乱舞，鼻间充满了海盐的气息。头顶上，太阳依旧在臭氧层上烧出一个洞，一波波热浪打在他的后颈，但至少海风带来了凉爽。

Having a sudden inclination to feel the soft crunch of sand under his toes, and the touch of the cold water as it hit his skin, he untied his shoes and pulled off his socks, throwing them in a heap. Rolling up his pant legs, he slowly walked out into the surf.  
突然间，他想要感受沙子在脚趾间的柔软触感，以及冷水触碰肌肤的凉意，于是他解开鞋带，脱下袜子，扔成一堆。卷起裤腿，他缓缓走向海浪。

He felt oddly relaxed as he continued walking through the water, almost serene, as the water splashed around his pants, slowly soaking them and his shirt as the spray from the waves flew around him. Suddenly having an urge to completely soak his body, he turned around and let himself fall slowly backwards, just as a large wave came crashing into him, propelling him forward several feet. With his entire body soaked, his head broke the surface of the water and he let himself float there for a few seconds before he placed his feet down on firm ground.  
他继续在水里走着，感到一种奇异的放松，几乎可以说是宁静，水花溅在他的裤子上，慢慢地浸湿了裤子和衬衫，海浪的飞沫环绕着他。突然间，他有一种想要全身湿透的冲动，于是他转过身，让自己缓缓向后倒下，正好一个大浪打来，将他向前推了几英尺。全身湿透后，他的头破水而出，他让自己在那里漂浮了几秒钟，然后才把脚放在坚实的地面上。

With his body now facing the other way, he could see a figure standing exactly where he stood those many months ago. Her fiery hair flew behind her as the sea breeze splashed over her face, making her already over saturated eyes produce more tears. Unfortunately, she wasn't wearing the sun dress that he had first seen her in, but even so...  
现在他的身体转向了另一边，他可以看到一个身影站在他几个月前站过的地方。她的火红头发在海风中飘扬，海风拂过她的脸庞，让她的眼睛已经过度湿润，泪水不断涌出。遗憾的是，她没有穿他第一次见到她时的那条太阳裙，但即便如此……

She stood there for a few minutes, as though unsure whether Shinji was ready to talk yet. But as Shinji continued to gaze at her, she took that as an unspoken that, 'Yes...it was fine...'  
她在那里站了几分钟，似乎不确定真嗣是否准备好谈话。但当真嗣继续凝视着她时，她将其视为一种无声的信号，'是的……可以了……'

Turning towards the cement stairway, she jumped the stairs two at a time before landing with a thud on the soft sand and started running towards him, but slowed as she neared him before stopping all together at the edge of the water.  
她转身面向水泥楼梯，两级并作一级跳了下去，落地时在柔软的沙滩上发出一声闷响，随即朝他跑去，但随着距离的拉近，她的步伐逐渐放缓，最终在海水边缘停了下来。

Shinji meanwhile sat in the water several feet away from her, ignoring his water logged pants and the feel of the water as it splashed against his back. Smiling slightly at the expression that now showed on her face as though she wasn't really keen to get wet, he threw her a look that said, 'C'mon, its not that cold really.'  
与此同时，真嗣坐在离她几英尺远的水中，无视浸透的裤子和水花拍打在背上的感觉。他微微一笑，看着她脸上显露出的表情，仿佛并不太愿意弄湿自己，然后向她投去一个眼神，似乎在说：‘来吧，真的没那么冷。’

Asuka frowned at his expression but eventually knelt down and slipped the sandals off her feet that she had been wearing and kicked them next to Shinji's discarded shoes. Rolling up her own pant legs, she started wading out to where Shinji waited for her.  
明日香对他的表情皱了皱眉，但最终还是跪下来脱掉了脚上的凉鞋，将它们踢到真嗣丢弃的鞋子旁边。她卷起自己的裤腿，开始涉水走向等待着她的真嗣。

As she slowly got closer, Shinji finally broke the long silence, "Took you long enough."  
"当她缓缓靠近时，真嗣终于打破了长时间的沉默，“你来得可真久。””

Asuka was silent as she couldn't walking towards him, being careful to avoid any small rocks or shellfish.  
"明日香沉默不语，小心翼翼地向他走去，避免踩到任何小石子或贝壳。”

"What happened? Why'd you wait so long to come down here?"  
"“发生了什么？为什么你等了这么久才下来？””

"I didn't want to intrude," mumbled Asuka in a very sincere, and un-Asuka like way as she neared him.  
"我不想打扰你，" 明日香用一种非常真诚、且不像她平时的方式低声说道，同时向他靠近。

Shinji frowned at this depressing response and with a sudden thought, leaned forward and grabbed Asuka's arm, pulling her towards him.  
真嗣对这个令人沮丧的回答皱起了眉头，突然间灵机一动，向前倾身抓住了明日香的手臂，将她拉向自己。

"Shinji what are yo-WAAHH!"  
"真嗣，你在干什么——哇啊！"

Shinji accidentally pulled a little too hard, sending her cascading into him, pushing him backwards in the process so that she fell on top of him. Shinji's head hit the soft sand and soon he felt it cake on the back of his head. Well he'd just take a shower later.  
真嗣不小心用力过猛，让她顺势扑倒在他身上，同时将他向后推倒，结果她压在了他身上。真嗣的头撞上了柔软的沙子，很快他就感觉到沙子粘在了他的后脑勺上。好吧，他晚点再洗个澡就行了。

Water flowed around his hair, turning it wavy while Asuka's pants unrolled themselves and got soaked everywhere below the knee.  
水流环绕着他的头发，使其变得波浪起伏，而明日香的长裤自动卷起，膝盖以下的部分全都被浸湿了。

"Shinji you idiot," said Asuka, as she pushed herself off of him. "Why'd you go and do something like that?"  
“真嗣你这个笨蛋，”明日香一边说着，一边从他身上撑起身子。“你为什么要做那样的事？”

"Because you didn't seem to want to get wet."  
"因为你看起来不想被淋湿。"

"Of course not! We do still have to walk back to Nerv and-"  
"当然不想！我们还得走回 NERV 总部，而且-"

"We can let them dry out in the sun."  
"我们可以让它们在太阳下晒干。"

"I don't want to walk around Tokyo-3 looking as though I jumped into a swimming pool fully clothe-"  
"我不想在第三新东京市里走动，看起来像是穿着衣服跳进了游泳池一样——"

At that moment, Shinji chose to sending his right hand soaring upward through the water, splashing water across the left side of Asuka's face, cutting her off instantly.  
就在这时，真嗣决定将他的右手猛地向上划过水面，溅起的水花洒在了明日香脸的左侧，立刻打断了她的话。

As the water slowly dripped from Asuka's wet bangs, Shinji could see a vein pulsating in her temple and knew that he was in for it.  
随着水珠从明日香湿漉漉的刘海缓缓滴落，真嗣能看到她太阳穴上跳动的青筋，知道这下麻烦了。

"Moron," seethed Asuka as she pushed Shinji down into the water, creating an imprint of his body in the wet sand. Shinji retaliated by splashing water across the rest of her pants with both his hands, creating an anchor of some kind to weigh her down. Not much is left to be said besides the fact that for the next ten minutes they engaged in a very heated water fight.  
"傻瓜," 明日香一边说着，一边将真嗣推入水中，在湿沙上留下他的身体印记。真嗣用双手向她剩下的裤子上泼水作为回击，仿佛在给她制造某种锚，使她无法动弹。除了接下来十分钟他们进行了一场激烈的水仗之外，没什么好说的了。

As the splashing of water died down though, and both became visibly exhausted, they let themselves fall down to earth and lay in the surf for several minutes before Asuka finally spoke up.  
随着水花声渐渐平息，两人都明显疲惫不堪，他们让自己倒在地上，躺在海浪中休息了几分钟，最终明日香开口了。

"I'm really sorry for earlier," she whispered.  
"之前的事，我真的很抱歉," 她低声说道。

Shinji had been waiting for this sometime or another and simply said, "You were surprised is all, I expected that."  
真嗣已经预料到这一刻迟早会来，于是只是淡淡地说：“你只是感到惊讶而已，我早有预料。”

"No, it was rude for me to call you a pervert after what we...well shared together. And what I said about the earrings, I'm sor-"  
“不，我称你为变态确实失礼了，毕竟我们……嗯，共同经历了那么多。还有关于耳环的事，我很抱歉——”

"You're starting to sound like me you know."  
“你开始变得像我了，你知道吗。”

Asuka rolled over on her side so she could see him better and said fervently, "I'm serious. I don't like acting all abrasive when I'm around you, I wish I could just be myself."  
明日香侧过身来，以便更清楚地看到他，热切地说道：“我是认真的。我不喜欢在你身边表现得那么刻薄，我希望我能做回真正的自己。”

"But you are being yourself Asuka...moodiness and all."  
“但明日香，你现在就是你自己啊……包括你的情绪化。”

Silence greeted his words and Shinji was momentarily waiting for a backlash when Asuka smoothed it over by saying, "I suppose you're right."  
他的话音落下，四周一片寂静，真嗣一时等待着她的反驳，但明日香却缓和了气氛，说道：“我想你是对的。”

Shinji nodded silently up at the sky in response.  
真嗣默默地点头，仰望着天空作为回应。

"But it was embarrassing to meet Misato, Ritsuko, and Kaji there."  
“但在那里见到美里、律子和加持，真的很尴尬。”

"Really? I think I might have been more angry at them then you actually."  
“真的吗？我觉得我当时可能比你还生气呢。”

"For what?" “为了什么？”

Shinji shrugged. "Interrupting I suppose."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“打断了吧，我想。”

Asuka raised an eyebrow and said, "Why? Did you expect anything else to happen?"  
明日香挑起眉毛说道：“为什么？你难道还期待发生别的什么吗？”

"Well..." "嗯..."

"Forget it," replied Asuka, wishing she hadn't asked. After a moments pause, she add, "Though I did have fun overall...it has been a while since we could relax."  
"算了，" 明日香回答道，后悔自己问了这个问题。片刻之后，她补充说，"不过总的来说挺开心的...我们已经很久没有放松过了。"

"...So it was a successful date then?" asked Shinji hesitantly.  
"...那这次约会算是成功了？" 真嗣犹豫地问道。"

Asuka paused for a moment before she said, "Yeah...you could say that I suppose."  
明日香顿了一下，然后说：“嗯……可以这么说吧，我想。”

They continued laying like that in the water for several minutes, there previous discussion forgotten.  
他们继续那样躺在水里，之前的讨论已被遗忘。

"Hey Asuka?" asked Shinji suddenly.  
“嘿，明日香？”真嗣突然问道。

"Hmmm, what?" she replied with her eyes closed.  
"嗯，什么？" 她闭着眼睛回答道。

"I never told you that I had met you before we actually saw each other at school did I..."  
"我从未告诉过你，在我们真正在学校见面之前我就已经遇到过你了，对吧..."

Asuka repositioned herself so fast that Shinji felt the water ripples from her movement hit his arm. She was now sitting up with her mouth slightly open and a surprised look on her face. Shinji noticed then that part of the Nerv shirt she was wearing was pulled down over one shoulder, while large splotches of the shirt were virtually see through. Not to mention the A10 nerve clips she normally wore were lost sometime during the water fight and her hair now hung in two large bunches over each shoulder.  
明日香迅速调整了自己的位置，快到让真嗣感觉到她动作引起的水波冲击到他的手臂。她现在坐了起来，嘴巴微微张开，脸上带着惊讶的表情。真嗣这时注意到，她穿着的 NERV 衬衫有一边肩膀被拉了下来，而衬衫上的大片区域几乎变得透明。更不用说她平时戴的 A10 神经夹在水仗中不知何时丢失了，现在她的头发分成两大束垂在每边肩膀上。

"What did you say?" she asked completely stunned.  
"你说什么？" 她完全愣住了。

"Well...we didn't really meet, but I saw you, though you didn't see me."  
"嗯...我们并没有真正见面，但我看到了你，尽管你没看到我。"

"When? Where?" "什么时候？在哪里？"

"Err...right here actually."  
"呃...实际上就在这里。"

It took Shinji's words a few seconds to register before a puzzled expression passed over her face.  
真嗣的话过了几秒钟才传达到她的意识中，随后她的脸上掠过一丝困惑的表情。

"What are you talking about?"  
“你在说什么？”

"It was...the day before I met Misato and you were here looking out across the sea. The sun was setting and I remember you were wearing that summer dress of yours."  
"那是在我遇见美里小姐的前一天，你站在这里眺望大海。太阳正在落山，我记得你当时穿着那件夏日的连衣裙。"

Asuka paused as she tried to remember what he was talking about.  
明日香停顿了一下，试图回忆他在说什么。

"I think I remember something like that...but what were you doing out?"  
“我想我记得类似的事情……但你当时在外面做什么？”

"Walking and thinking. I always did a lot of that then."  
“散步和思考。那时候我经常这么做。”

"And you saw me? And I was looking out across the ocean?"  
"你看到我了？我那时正眺望着大海？"

"Yeah...and I remember thinking that I should have talked to you then, but I was supposed to be leaving the next day. But of course I met Misato and I remembered you and how I should have talked to you. Then of course you show up at school and...well the rest is obvious."  
"是的...我还记得当时想着应该和你聊聊，但我第二天就要离开了。不过当然，我遇到了美里，想起了你，以及我应该和你聊聊。然后你当然出现在学校里...嗯，剩下的就很明显了。"

Asuka continued looking at him for several seconds before she said, "Why didn't you ever tell me that before?"  
绫波继续盯着他看了几秒钟，然后问道：“你为什么之前从没告诉过我这些？”

"Didn't remember it until just now...everything else just sorta eclipsed it."  
"直到刚才才记起来...其他一切都把它遮住了。"

Asuka continued to look back at him utterly dumbfounded by the fact that she could have met him before the Evangelions and everything else.  
明日香继续回头看着他，完全无法理解自己怎么可能在遇到福音战士和其他一切之前就见过他。

"Actually I've always wanted to know what you were thinking that time when you were looking at the ocean," said Shinji, pulling Asuka way from her train of thought.  
"其实我一直想知道，你当时看着大海时在想什么，" 真嗣说着，把明日香从思绪中拉了回来。"

"Thats," she started, but didn't really want to finish.  
"那个，" 她开口了，却并不想说完。

"What?" he asked after she didn't respond after a few seconds.  
"什么？" 他问道，因为她几秒钟后仍未回应。

"Its stupid..." "这很蠢……"

"I doubt that." "我对此表示怀疑。"

"No, it really is." "不，真的是这样。"

"I don't care, and its not like I'd laugh or anything."  
"我不在乎，而且我也不会笑什么的。"

"If you do I'll kill you."  
"如果你敢笑，我就杀了你。"

'How many times have I heard that,' thought Shinji.  
“这话我听了多少遍了，”真嗣心想。

"Yes, I know...now tell me."  
“是的，我知道……现在告诉我吧。”

"Fine...I was talking to my mother."  
“好吧……我刚才在跟我妈妈说话。”

It was Shinji's turn to look surprised and he had to do a double take at that. Looking at her, he could see that a steady tinge of pink was starting to creep into her cheeks.  
轮到真嗣露出惊讶的表情，他不得不再次确认。看着她，他注意到她脸颊上渐渐泛起了一抹稳定的粉红色。

"Go on...laugh." “继续...笑吧。”

"I'm not...but Asuka isn't your mother...dea-"  
“我没有...但明日香不是你妈妈...死-”

"Yes, she's dead. I know she's dead. But I don't know...maybe it was because I'd finally moved to Tokyo-3 after all the training to become an Eva pilot...I just felt like talking...and I just sorta thought of her then. I never knew her very well...being too young to remember much but I sorta conjured up a mental image of what she looked like. I think a part of me just wanted to be praised for what I had accomplished."  
"是的，她已经去世了。我知道她去世了。但我不明白...也许是因为我终于在经历了成为 Eva 驾驶员的所有训练后搬到了第三新东京市...我只是觉得想说话...然后我就突然想起了她。我其实对她了解不多...因为年纪太小，记不清太多事情，但我脑海中隐约浮现出她的样子。我想，我的一部分只是想得到一些对我所取得的成就的赞扬。"

Silence ensued between them at Asuka's finally words, and Shinji wasn't really sure how he should respond. In truth, Shinji had never thought of speaking to his mother...well he supposed he had inside Unit 01, but in the sense Asuka was talking about. Maybe it was because he'd never had anything substantial that he could talk about, before he met Asuka, Misato, and started piloting Unit 01.  
在听到明日香最后的话语后，两人陷入了沉默，真嗣并不确定该如何回应。实际上，真嗣从未想过与他的母亲交谈...嗯，他觉得在初号机里有过，但不是明日香所说的那种方式。也许是因为在他遇到明日香、美里并开始驾驶初号机之前，他从未有过什么实质性的事情可以谈论。

"You must think I was acting childish," mumbled Asuka, interrupting Shinji's thought.  
"你一定觉得我当时很幼稚，"明日香打断了真嗣的思绪，低声说道。"

Turning towards her, his hair dripping wet from the surf he said, "No, I don't. If I had something to talk about with my mother I'd probably do the same. And don't call it childish...its perfectly reasonably to want to talk to your mother, and besides," here Shinji looked up into the blue sky and said, "we're still children after all...so its okay to want the love of a parent."  
转向她，他的头发因海浪而湿漉漉的，他说：“不，我没有。如果我有事要和妈妈谈，我大概也会这么做。别说是孩子气……想和妈妈说话完全合情合理，而且，”说到这里，真嗣抬头望向蓝天，“我们毕竟还是孩子……所以渴望父母的关爱是没问题的。”

Asuka scoffed lightly at his comment, but understood what he meant. They were still kids and had a kids outlook on life, even if they were forced to shoulder an adults responsibility at a young age.  
明日香对他的话轻蔑地笑了笑，但理解他的意思。他们还是孩子，有着孩子的生活观，尽管在年幼时就不得不承担成人的责任。

"Thanks," Asuka whispered.  
“谢谢，”明日香低声说道。

"...For what?" he replied.  
"...为了什么？" 他回答道。

Asuka laughed lightly and said, "For everything I suppose...I'm glad that I met you."  
明日香轻声笑了笑，说道："我想是为了所有的一切吧...我很高兴遇见了你。"

Asuka smiled here and it was like the sun suddenly came down from the sky and greeted Shinji's face. He had to openly turn away from her.  
明日香在这里微笑了，仿佛太阳突然从天空降临，照亮了真嗣的脸庞。他不得不转过身去，避开她的目光。

Looking up in the sky he briefly reflected on everything that had happened to him. Did he consider himself happy? Well, he supposed that this was the happiest he had ever been in his life, even with the prospect of fighting another angel soon. But he supposed that he had to be thankful for piloting Unit 01, because in someway, it had changed him as a person, and he felt that this person was different that his old self.  
他抬头望向天空，短暂地回顾了自己经历的一切。他觉得自己幸福吗？嗯，他想这是他一生中最快乐的时光，尽管不久后可能又要与另一个天使战斗。但他认为，他必须感谢驾驶初号机，因为在某种程度上，它改变了他这个人，他感到现在的自己与过去的自己不同了。

"We should probably head back to Nerv," he said suddenly, still looking at the sky.  
“我们或许应该回 NERV 了，”他突然说道，目光依旧停留在天空。

"What happened to laying out in the sun waiting for our clothes to dry?" asked Asuka.  
“躺在阳光下等衣服干的事怎么办？”明日香问道。

"Do you want to stay out here and steadily get colder? Or would you prefer to hurry back to Nerv and take a shower?"  
"你是想在这里慢慢变冷呢？还是宁愿赶紧回 NERV 洗个澡？"

Briefly looking at herself, Asuka understood what he meant. In simple terms, she looked worse than when she usually woke up.  
简短地看了看自己，明日香明白他的意思。简单来说，她看起来比平时刚醒来时还要糟糕。

"I guess you're right...even though you were the one that suggested staying out in the first place."  
"我想你是对的...尽管最初提议留在外面的人是你。"

Placing his hands behind himself, Shinji pushed himself up in a sitting position and then reached a hand out to Asuka.  
将双手置于身后，真嗣用力撑起身体坐直，随后向明日香伸出手。

"C'mon, lets go before we start shivering."  
“快点，我们走吧，免得开始发抖。”

Asuka looked at him blankly for a view seconds with his hand outstretched towards her, before she said very quietly, "One last thing Shinji..."  
明日香茫然地看了他几秒钟，他的手伸向她，然后她非常轻声地说道：“真嗣，最后一件事……”

Shinji was rather taken aback at this and drew his hand back to his side.  
真嗣对此颇为惊讶，将手缩回到身侧。

"Whats up Asu-" but thats as far as he got before she reached out with her right hand and pushed roughly against his chest, sending him back into the water.  
“怎么了，明日香——”但他话还没说完，她已经伸出右手，粗鲁地推在他的胸口，将他推回了水中。

Shinji at first thought this was retaliation for earlier when he had splashed water across her face during there water fight, when he noticed the sun being blocked out through his half closed eyes. As he opened his eyes, he saw that Asuka was kneeling beside him on his left, biting down on her salty lips.  
起初，真嗣以为这是对他之前在水中打闹时朝她脸上泼水的报复，但当他半闭着眼睛注意到阳光被遮挡时，他睁开了眼睛，看到明日香正跪在他左边，咬着她咸咸的嘴唇。

Shinji blinked several times, under the impression that this was some strange illusion that his adolescent mind had conjured up in the span of four-seconds, when he noticed a weight pressed against his chest. Realizing this wasn't an illusion, he looked up into Asuka's face, which had drawn exceedingly close to his own, while both of her hands were resting on his soaked shirt.  
真嗣眨了几次眼，以为这是他青春期头脑在四秒钟内构想出的某种奇怪幻觉，这时他注意到胸口有一股压力。意识到这不是幻觉，他抬头看向明日香的脸上，她的脸已经离他非常近，而她的双手正放在他湿透的衬衫上。

"Asu...ka...what are you-"  
"明日香...你在做什..."

"Returning a favor," she said through half closed lips.  
"回报恩情，"她半闭着嘴唇说道。

'Oh God,' was all Shinji was able to think as Asuka drew closer.  
"哦，天哪，"这是绫波唯一能想到的，当明日香逐渐靠近时。

Like a tire rupturing on a freeway, Shinji's brain all but imploded on itself as Asuka's lips came into contact with his skin. His body, already starting to shiver from the lukewarm water, suddenly heated up and boiled over to the point where people would think he had a fever. Shinji suddenly felt small droplets of water hit his face and momentarily thought that Asuka was crying, when he looked up and saw that water from the surf still on her face was steadily dripping from her chin and falling around the corners of his lips. Moving his lips slightly, the droplets which had built at the corner of his lips fell between them, spilling across the inside of his mouth. Salty...but pleasant nonetheless. Her hair, drenched with there past water fight and laying in the surf, hung limply around his face, creating a sort of curtain, shielding them in case other people saw them. He could smell the salt of the ocean mixed in with the normal flowery smell that seemed to radiated off her hair. It was enough to make his head spin. Her lips...well those were currently pressed against his forehead, as his had down earlier that the morning. He felt the softness of them against his forehead, there own moistness mixed in with the ocean water, the feel as she parted them slightly as he himself had done. What he wouldn't give to let this last a little longer...  
宛如高速公路上爆胎一般，当明日香的唇触碰到他的肌肤时，真嗣的大脑几乎要自爆了。他的身体本已因微温的水而开始颤抖，此刻却骤然升温沸腾，以至于旁人会以为他发烧了。真嗣突然感到几滴水珠打在脸上，一时以为明日香在哭泣，抬头却发现她脸上残留的海水正从下巴缓缓滴落，溅在他唇边。他微微动了动嘴唇，积聚在唇角的水珠便滑入其间，洒满口腔内部。咸涩……却也别有一番滋味。她的发丝，因先前的水仗而湿透，此刻散落在海浪中，软软地环绕在他脸庞，仿佛一道帘幕，遮挡着以防他人窥见。他能嗅到海盐的气息混杂着她发间散发的寻常花香。这足以令他头晕目眩。她的唇……此刻正紧贴在他的额头上，正如他今早所做的那样。 他感受到它们轻柔地贴在他的额头上，与海水混合的湿润，以及当她轻轻分开它们时，那种感觉与他自己的动作如出一辙。他多么希望这一刻能再延长一些...

And then it was gone.  
然后，一切就消失了。

Asuka lips along with her hands, left his body all at once, creating the impression that they had never been there. Still kneeling next to him, she wasn't really looking at him, more like a point directly past his shoulder. She thought she had surprised him, and that was part of it, but she wanted to see his response to what she had just done. Honestly, she couldn't believe what she had done herself...and yet it had felt oddly pleasant.  
明日香的嘴唇连同她的双手，一下子离开了他的身体，仿佛它们从未存在过。她仍然跪在他旁边，并没有真正看着他，更像是在注视着他肩膀后的某个点。她以为自己吓到了他，这确实是其中一部分，但她更想看到他对她刚刚所做之事的反应。老实说，她自己也不敢相信她做了那样的事...然而，那种感觉却出奇地愉悦。

Shinji continued laying there, his face completely passive as though nothing had happened. Suddenly though, he moved so fast that Asuka blinked and he was sitting up, a hand pressed against the spot where she had kissed him.  
真嗣继续躺在那里，脸上毫无表情，仿佛什么都没发生过。然而突然间，他动作快得让明日香眨了眨眼，他已经坐了起来，一只手按在她吻过的地方。

A moment of awkward silence passed between them before Shinji asked, "How come you did that?" It wasn't accusatory, just curious.  
一阵尴尬的沉默在他们之间蔓延，随后真嗣问道：“你为什么要那样做？”语气并非责备，只是好奇。

As Shinji watched out of the corner of his eyes, he was rather surprised that Asuka wasn't blushing. It was almost as though there places had switched since earlier. She had simply done it because she felt like, and she didn't feel embarrassed about it in the least.  
真嗣用眼角余光观察着，惊讶地发现明日香并没有脸红。这几乎像是他们的角色互换了，她只是因为想做就做了，丝毫没有感到尴尬。

"Not sure," she finally said. "Part of it was payback for earlier I suppose. Another part of me...just felt like it though."  
"不太确定，"她最终说道，"一部分可能是为了之前的回报吧。另一部分的我……只是觉得想这么做。"

Shinji nodded his head briefly at that, understanding what she was getting at. He had virtually felt the same thing when he had kissed her forehead earlier. As she had said, he had just felt like it...  
真嗣对此微微点头，理解她的意思。之前他亲吻她的额头时，几乎也有同样的感觉。正如她所说，他只是觉得想这么做……

"We should probably get going," said Shinji again, thinking of steering the conversation away from something they weren't quite sure of yet. They had taken a few steps...but things could wait.  
"我们或许该动身了，"真嗣再次说道，想着转移话题，避免讨论他们尚未完全明白的事情。他们已经走了几步……但事情可以稍后再说。"

Shinji made to stand up, but Asuka grabbed his hand and said, "Hold on...one last thing."  
真嗣正要站起来，但明日香抓住他的手说：“等等……还有最后一件事。”

"Can't it wait till later...or were you planning to ki-"  
“不能等到以后再说吗……还是你打算现在就……”

"As if," she said getting annoyed, "I just wanted to ask you something that I thought would be...well, something that would be appropriate for right now."  
“想得美，”她有些恼火地说，“我只是想问你一件事，我觉得现在问……嗯，挺合适的。”

Shinji looked at her evenly and even though he didn't know what she was gonna ask, he kinda understood what she meant. They both realized things then, things that didn't need to be spoken about where they were going, and what they would be doing in the near future.  
真嗣平静地看着她，尽管他不知道她要问什么，但他大致明白她的意思。那时，他们俩都意识到了一些事情，那些无需言说的事情，关于他们将去往何方，以及在不久的将来会做些什么。

"So...whats up?" “那么……怎么了？”

In response, Asuka steadily applied more force on Shinji's hand and he took that to mean she wanted him to sit next to her. Sitting down next to her again, he felt water trickling around his feet but ignored it and turned to her wordlessly. Looking back at him, Asuka hesitantly for a second before she took a deep breath and said...  
作为回应，明日香稳稳地加大了握住真嗣手的力度，他理解为她想让他坐在她旁边。再次坐到她身边，他感觉到水流环绕着他的脚，但他没有理会，默默地转向她。明日香回望着他，犹豫了一秒钟，然后深吸一口气，说道……

"Have you ever kissed somebody?"  
"你曾经吻过某人吗？"

Asuka caught Shinji so off guard that he almost fell over.  
明日香的问题让真嗣措手不及，他差点摔倒。

"What! What do you mean have I ever kissed somebody...when I've-"  
"什么！你什么意思，我有没有吻过某人...我明明-"

"Not like that," Asuka said hurriedly, shaking her head, making her hair even more unruly then it already was.  
"不是那样，" 明日香急忙说，摇着头，让她的头发比平时更加凌乱。

"I mean _actually_ kissed somebody."  
"我是说真的亲吻过某人。"

Shinji opened his mouth when he was still confused, but suddenly understood what she was getting at and let it hang open.  
真嗣张开嘴，仍然困惑不解，但突然明白了她的意思，于是让嘴巴保持张开。

"Oh...that," he said after finally closing his mouth with a snap. Swallowing loudly he finished, "No I haven't..."  
"哦...那个," 他终于啪的一声合上了嘴，大声咽了口口水，接着说，"不，我没有..."

"I see," said Asuka as though finally coming to some conclusion.  
"我明白了," 明日香说道，仿佛终于得出了某个结论。

"You?" "你？"

"Nope...never really thought about it much..."  
"没有...从来没怎么认真想过..."

"And exactly why did you want to know that?" asked Shinji a little smugly.  
"你到底为什么想知道这个？" 真嗣略带得意地问道。

Asuka blinked openly for a second before she grimaced and said, "Not telling you anything."  
明日香愣了一会儿，然后皱着眉说："不告诉你。"

'Figures,' thought Shinji.  
'真是意料之中，' 真嗣心想。

"So whats next," he asked, poking fun at her sudden inclination to get all affectionate, "Wanna know what my-"  
"那接下来呢，" 他打趣道，调侃她突然变得亲昵的倾向，"想知道我的什么——"

Asuka elbowed him none to gently in the side and said, "Say anything else and I'll hit you idiot."  
明日香不轻不重地用胳膊肘撞了他一下，说道："再说一个字，我就揍你，白痴。"

Shinji smiled at that. Things had somewhat shifted to what they were normally used to. Though what they felt for each other still lingered.  
真嗣对此微微一笑。事情已经有些回归到他们平常习惯的状态了。尽管他们之间的感情依旧萦绕不去。

"Fine then," said Asuka standing up and trying to ignore how water logged she felt. "Lets get back to Nerv...you're were right, I do need a shower."  
“好吧，”明日香站起来，试图忽略自己浑身湿透的感觉，“我们回 NERV 吧……你说得对，我确实需要洗个澡。”

"Should we take the tram or call a cab?"  
“我们是坐电车还是叫辆出租车？”

"How far is the tram?"  
“电车还有多远？”

"A few blocks that way," said Shinji pointing to his right.  
“再过几个街区就到了。”真嗣指着他的右边说。

Asuka thought for a moment before she said, "On second thought, lets walk. It'll dry us out some and I don't really want to be gawked at by other people right now."  
明日香想了一会儿，然后说：“再想想，我们还是走路吧。这样能让我们稍微干爽些，而且我现在也不想被别人盯着看。”

Shinji understood what she meant and briefly looked at her chest where a white bra could be seen underneath the faded shirt.  
真嗣明白她的意思，短暂地瞥了一眼她胸前，褪色的衬衫下隐约可见白色的胸罩。

"C'mon on then lets go," Shinji said for what he hoped was the last time.  
“那就快点走吧，”真嗣说道，他希望这是最后一次。

Not having anything else to add, Asuka nodded wordlessly at Shinji and together they walked away from there first encounter.  
没有什么要补充的了，明日香默默地点头回应真嗣，两人一起离开了他们的初次相遇之地。

"I don't even want to know what you two were doing or where you went...but for Gods sake refrain from embarrassing Nerv already," said Misato harshly.  
"我甚至不想知道你们俩在做什么或者去了哪里...但看在上帝的份上，别再让 Nerv 丢脸了，" 美里严厉地说道。

Her, Shinji, and Asuka were standing inside her office. As it turned out, Shinji and Asuka had ended up taking the tram when they realized how long it would take to return to Nerv with their water logged clothes. In the end, many people had gotten an eyeful of Asuka's semi nakedness and Shinji had threatened to bight off a few many teenagers heads in response. Asuka however was oddly touched by Shinji's protectiveness over her, even if it did annoy her at the same time.  
她和真嗣、明日香站在她的办公室里。原来，真嗣和明日香发现湿透的衣服让他们返回 Nerv 的时间变得异常漫长，于是决定乘坐电车。结果，许多人看到了明日香半裸的样子，而真嗣则威胁要咬掉几个青少年的头作为回应。然而，明日香对真嗣保护她的行为感到意外的感动，尽管这同时也让她感到恼火。

Misato faced planted on her desk after her rebuke over their behavior.  
美里在训斥了他们的行为后，脸朝下趴在了桌子上。

Shinji, unable to hold back the subject any longer finally said, "If you must know we went swimming."  
真嗣，终于忍不住这个话题，最终说道：“如果你非要知道的话，我们去游泳了。”

"Swimming?" asked Misato as she raised her head off a stack of papers that were resting on her desk.  
“游泳？”美里抬起头，从堆放在桌上的文件中抬起头来问道。

"Yeah, down on the beach."  
“是啊，在海边。”

"And you didn't think to take your clothes off first?"  
"你没想到先脱掉衣服吗？"

Shinji raised an eyebrow at Misato and glanced briefly at Asuka who was determinedly not looking at either of them. Realizing the problems that would have been involved with her suggestion, Misato mumbled, "Oh right...didn't think about that."  
真嗣对美里扬了扬眉毛，短暂地瞥了一眼坚决不看着他们俩的明日香。意识到她建议中涉及的问题，美里咕哝道：“哦对……没想到这一点。”

"Its fine," said Asuka, surprising both Shinji and Misato. "Are we done, because I do need to take a shower?  
"没事，"明日香说，这让真嗣和美里都感到意外。"我们说完了吗，因为我确实需要洗个澡？"

Leaning back in her chair, Misato sighed and said, "Yes alright, go take a shower. Shinji?"  
靠在椅背上，美里叹了口气说道：“好吧，去洗个澡吧。真嗣？”

"...Yeah I need one also."  
“……嗯，我也需要洗一个。”

"Fine, Asuka you know where they are right?"  
“好的，明日香，你知道它们在哪儿吧？”

"Yeah, I'll show him." "是啊，我会让他见识到的。"

"Great, because I've got a lot of stuff to finish before tomorrow. And Asuka."  
"太好了，因为我明天之前还有很多事情要完成。还有明日香。"

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"There is a synchronization test scheduled for you tomorrow...I know its rather sudden but-"  
"明天安排了你的同步测试……我知道这有点突然，但是——"

"I'll be fine," said Asuka without any hitch in her voice.  
"我会没事的," 明日香语气平稳地说道。

Misato looked at her for a view more seconds, looking for any sort of fear or resentment in her voice. Not noticing any such thing she said, "Okay get going...the smell is starting to get to me."  
美里又盯着她看了几秒钟，试图从她的声音中捕捉到任何恐惧或怨恨。没有发现任何异常，她说道："好吧，快走吧...这味道开始让我受不了了。"

Shinji and Asuka nodded and left silently together through Misato's office door.  
真嗣和明日香点头示意，一起默默地离开了美里的办公室。

Out in the hallway, they walked silently together for a while until they reached the fork where there respective showering areas were.  
在走廊上，他们默默地走了一会儿，直到到达各自淋浴区的分岔口。

"Its through that door," said Asuka pointing towards the mens showers, obviously weary of the days events and looking forward to crawling into bed. As she turned towards the woman's bathroom however, Shinji grabbed ahold of her hand and asked quietly, "About what Misato said back there...are you really okay with the synchronization tests, because if not I can go back and-"  
“那是男淋浴间，”明日香指着门说道，显然对今天的事情感到疲惫，期待着爬上床。然而，当她转向女浴室时，真嗣抓住了她的手，轻声问道：“关于美里之前说的同步测试……你真的没问题吗？如果不行，我可以回去——”

"No...I'll be fine," Asuka whispered.  
“不……我会没事的，”明日香低声说道。

Shinji hesitated, not sure how far he wanted to go with this. Asuka however sensed his uneasiness and said, "I'm fine...really. Today made me...think about a lot of things that I had never wanted to think of, or acknowledge for that matter."  
真嗣犹豫了，不确定自己想在这件事上走多远。然而，明日香察觉到了他的不安，说道：“我没事……真的。今天让我……想起了很多我从未想过，或者说从未承认过的事情。”

"So then you're okay with this?"  
“那么，你对此没问题吗？”

"Its fine," she repeated.  
“没事的，”她重复道。

"If you...need anything...you know I'm here."  
"如果你...需要什么...你知道我在这里。"

Asuka turned towards Shinji and said, "You just being here is why I'm still able to continue."  
明日香转向真嗣，说道：“正是因为你在这里，我才能继续坚持下去。”

Without another word, she pulled her hand away from Shinji's grasp and walked into her own shower rooms.  
她没有再说一句话，从真嗣的掌握中抽出手，走进了自己的淋浴间。

Shinji stood there in the corridor for a few minutes before he himself walked into the mens shower room.  
真嗣在走廊里站了几分钟，然后才走进男更衣室。

Pulling off the his wet clothes, he tossed them in a heap next to the shower, and walked in. Turning on the water, he let out a low sigh and relished the feel as the hot water fell around his body.  
他脱下湿衣服，扔在淋浴间旁边的一堆，然后走了进去。打开水龙头，他低声叹息，享受着热水洒落在身上的感觉。

Unsure how long he stayed in there, when he eventually got out his fingers and toes were completely pruned. Wrapping a towel around his waist, he walked up the mirror and examined himself briefly. His own reflection blinked blankly back at him.  
不确定自己在里面待了多久，当他最终出来时，手指和脚趾都泡得皱巴巴的。他用毛巾围住腰部，走到镜子前，短暂地审视了自己一番。镜中的自己茫然地眨了眨眼。

'Whats changed?' he thought.  
“什么变了？”他心想。

In response, a brief flash of scarlet flickered in his eyes, unnerving him slightly but still reminding him that he had angel blood flowing through his veins, and no matter how much he wished it, his future was different than Asuka's...  
对此，他眼中闪过一抹猩红，虽令他略感不安，却也提醒着他体内流淌着天使之血，无论他多么希望，他的未来与明日香的不同……

Whiteness filled this world, with nothing but the sky and the white sand. Yet a different type of whiteness filled this world, a whiteness that would have been consider nothing but a large mass of energy. Currently, three masses of this white energy were gathered around the only object on the planet that casted a shadow. A large tree, devoid of any fruit stood in the middle of the infinite mass of sand, on what would have been considered the equator of the planet. The tree was a light grayish color, with many branches that forked off in many directions. This tree, according to the knowledge of the white masses, had been here for as far back as they could remember. But nothing had been born from the branches of the tree for many years. Hopefully that was about to change soon though.  
这个世界充斥着白色，除了天空和白沙别无他物。然而，另一种白色填满了这个世界，一种会被视为巨大能量团块的白色。目前，三团这种白色能量聚集在星球上唯一投下阴影的物体周围。一棵没有果实的大树矗立在无垠的沙海中央，位于被认为是行星赤道的位置。这棵树呈浅灰色，枝桠四散，据白色能量团体的知识，它存在的时间远超他们的记忆。但多年来，树枝上未曾诞生过任何生命。希望这一现状即将改变。

All three white masses sat on the branches of the tree, and to normal people, they would have considered the tree to be extremely brittle, and the branches to snap easily. The white masses seemed to not care about this though, or knew that no amount of weighed could ever cripple this tree.  
三团白色物体各自栖息在树枝上，对普通人而言，这棵树似乎极其脆弱，枝条极易折断。然而，这些白色物体似乎并不在意这一点，或者它们深知无论多么沉重的负担都无法压垮这棵树。

The white masses each had there own place on the tree, each governed a branch, and the one above them governed another branch until the last branches at the top opened up to the wide sky above them. However these last two branches were devoid of anything, for those white masses had long ago usurped there place here and chosen to remain on Earth until a human worthy enough to rebuild the tree could be found.  
每个白色物体在树上都有自己的位置，各自掌管着一根树枝，而它们上方的白色物体则掌管着另一根树枝，直到顶端的最后几根树枝向广阔的天空敞开。然而，这两根顶端的树枝却是空无一物，因为那些白色物体早已篡夺了它们的位置，并选择留在地球上，直到找到一个足够优秀的人类来重建这棵树。

The white mass at the top of the branches governed to him was looking up at the sky, as though pondering about the future of things to come. Below him, his brother and sister were talking about things to come. Unfortunately for him though, he saw the end of there lives, yet was expressly forbidden from deterring them from the chosen path. He was the last part of the objective, the last obstacle for the human chosen to overcome, the last thorn in the side for all of humanity for that matter.  
位于树枝顶端的白色物体仰望着天空，仿佛在沉思即将到来的未来。在他下方，他的兄弟姐妹正在讨论未来的事情。不幸的是，他预见到了他们生命的终结，但却被明确禁止阻止他们走上既定的道路。他是最后的客观存在，是人类选定要克服的最后一个障碍，也是整个人类面临的最后一根刺。

As he continued looking up at the sky, he placed a formless hand over the branch and thought, 'Soon the Tree of Life shall be restored and all of humanity will revert to the substance from which they were born from.'  
他继续仰望天空，将无形的手放在树枝上，心中暗想：‘生命之树即将恢复，全人类都将回归他们诞生的本源。’

As almost a parting thought, Tabris said out loud, "Ikari Shinji...I wish to meet you again..."  
几乎像是临别时的念头，Tabris 大声说道：“碇真嗣...我希望能再次见到你...”

**Final thing I wanted to add...you could probably just call this chapter Small Steps Part2, but I hate it when authors do that as if they aren't creative enough to think of a different chapter name. Just a pet peeve of mine I guess  
最后我想补充一点...你或许可以直接称这一章为‘小步前行 第二部分’，但我讨厌作者这样做，好像他们没有足够的创造力想出一个不同的章节名称。这大概只是我个人的一个小小的不满吧。**

### Chapter 20: Contact  

**Don't have much to say except spend time with your moms today...after you finish reading this of course.  
没什么要说的，除了今天多陪陪你的妈妈们……当然，是在读完这个之后。**

---

Shinji raised an eyebrow at what Misato had said.  
真嗣对美里的话挑了挑眉。

It was the next day and just several hours away from Asuka's synchronization test.  
第二天，距离明日香同步测试仅剩几个小时。

"What do you mean I can't be there during Asuka's synchronization test?" asked Shinji.  
“你说的我不能在明日香的同步测试时在场是什么意思？”真嗣问道。

Misato let out a sigh and said, "Shinji you must know why I can't allow you to be near Asuka while she does this."  
美里叹了口气，说道：“真嗣，你必须明白为什么我不能让你在明日香做这件事的时候靠近她。”

"No I don't understand!" said Shinji, his voice starting to bristle with anger. "Why shouldn't I be in there! She'd feel better if she knew I was close to her!"  
“不，我不明白！”真嗣的声音开始带着怒气，“为什么我不能在里面！如果她知道我在她身边，她会感觉好些的！”

"Thats exactly why I can't let you be there. We don't...know if she's able to pilot, and you being there will certainly cause her synchronization to fluctuated randomly. While she's confident in her ability to pilot, and I myself am confident that she's ready, we wont know for certain until she steps inside Unit 02." Here she paused and frowned at Shinji until she finished with, "And you two seem to have...gotten closer this past day. I'd prefer to not have to restrain you incase something _does_ happen with the test..."  
“这正是我不能让你在那里的原因。我们……不知道她是否还能驾驶，而你在那里肯定会引起她同步率的随机波动。虽然她对自己驾驶的能力有信心，我自己也相信她已经准备好了，但我们只有在她进入二号机后才能确定。”她停顿了一下，皱着眉头对真嗣说，“而且你们俩似乎……在过去的这一天里变得更亲近了。我宁愿不必要地约束你，以防测试中真的发生什么……”

"As if you could restrain me," mumbled Shinji.  
"好像你能约束我似的," 真嗣咕哝道。

Misato frowned at him, knowing that he had said something negative but not quite able to hear what it was.  
美里皱眉看着他，知道他说了些消极的话，但没太听清楚具体内容。

"I'm adamant about this...don't make me have to confine you to-"  
"我对此很坚决...别逼我不得不把你关起来-"

"Fine I get it," snarled Shinji.  
“好吧，我明白了，”真嗣咆哮道。

Without another word, he stormed out of Misato's office, leaving Misato briefly wishing that Shinji and Asuka had never met.  
他一言不发，怒气冲冲地离开了美里办公室，留下美里短暂地希望真嗣和明日香从未相遇。

---

Shinji's fist collided against the sheet-rocked wall the second he slammed the door closed with his foot, punching a hole straight through the wall and connecting with the hard metal beyond it. Adrenaline surging through his body, Shinji yanked his fist out of the hole, sending bits of white sheet rock and flecks of blood from his split knuckles flying through the air. Breathing heavily, adrenaline still flowing through him, he looked down at his torn hand as blood continued flowing from the split skin, and started dripping onto the ground.  
真嗣用脚猛地关上门的瞬间，拳头砸向了石膏板墙，直接穿透墙壁，撞上了后面的坚硬金属。肾上腺素在他体内涌动，真嗣从洞中抽出拳头，白色的石膏碎片和他破裂的指关节上的血滴飞溅到空中。他喘着粗气，肾上腺素仍在体内流动，低头看着自己受伤的手，血从裂开的皮肤中不断流出，滴落到地上。

"Damn it," he swore openly into the empty bedroom that was currently designated to him.  
“该死，”他对着目前指定给他的空荡卧室公开咒骂道。

Sitting down on the edge of the bed that him and Asuka had recently shared, he continued staring at his bleeding hand, making no apparent effort to stem the flow of blood.  
他坐在最近与明日香共用的床边，继续凝视着流血的手，显然没有努力止血。

"What am I doing?" he wondered.  
“我在做什么？”他疑惑着。

Asuka was going to pilot again, and his mind couldn't fully grasp that concept. He hated it when she stepped into her Evangelion, not only because it completely changed her, but largely because he wasn't able to be there and comfort her. She completely sectioned herself off from the rest of the world when she was incased in the entry-plug.  
明日香又要去驾驶了，他的心却无法完全接受这个概念。他讨厌她踏入她的 EVA，不仅因为她完全变了个人，更主要的是他无法在那里安慰她。当她被封闭在插入栓中时，她完全将自己与外界隔绝开来。

Then he had to wonder about her own Evangelion, Unit 02. If he was correct in his assumption, that a human soul resided in the Evangelions, and that the souls were somehow connected to person who pilots it...then who's soul was in Unit 02. As much as Shinji knew about Asuka, he couldn't think of anybody in her life who would have been considered applicable.  
然后他不得不思考她自己的 EVA，二号机。如果他的假设正确，即 EVA 中寄宿着人类的灵魂，而这些灵魂与驾驶者之间有着某种联系……那么二号机中又是谁的灵魂呢？尽管真嗣对明日香了解颇多，但他想不出她生命中有谁会被认为是合适的。

'Maybe she wont be able to pilot though,' he thought suddenly. 'If she can't, then how will she react? She felt confident about it, but I don't think she was telling me the entire truth. Certainly she has to feel some anxiety over this. Then what should I do if she can't pilot? Comfort her for starters I suppose...but then what, living here will be too painful for either of us. So then should we run away? Start a new life?'  
'也许她无法驾驶呢，'他突然想到。'如果她不能，她会怎么反应？她对此很有信心，但我觉得她并没有告诉我全部真相。她肯定对此感到焦虑。那么如果她不能驾驶，我该怎么办？首先安慰她……但之后呢，住在这里对我们俩都太痛苦了。那么我们应该逃跑吗？开始新的生活？'

The immediate thought of that put Shinji off. He hated it here, felt as though he was a pawn under his father, but he also had something that he and only he could do. That gave him a purpose in life which he had never had. No, he didn't think he'd be able to leave. Even so...if she isn't able to pilot.  
这个念头立刻让真嗣感到不适。他讨厌这里，感觉自己像是父亲手下的棋子，但他也有只有他能做到的事情。这给了他从未有过的生命意义。不，他不认为自己能离开。即便如此...如果她无法驾驶。

The adrenaline started to wear off from his cold fury earlier and his hand was starting to throb like crazy now. Bitting down on his lips, he stood up and walked to the bathroom down the hall to his right. Entering the bathroom, he turned on the faucet to one of the sinks, and submerged his hand in lukewarm water. It stung slightly, but he supposed this was better than letting it get infected.  
之前冰冷的愤怒带来的肾上腺素开始消退，他的手现在开始疯狂地抽痛。他咬紧嘴唇，站起来走向右边走廊尽头的浴室。进入浴室后，他打开其中一个水龙头的开关，将手浸入微温的水中。虽然有点刺痛，但他认为这总比让它感染要好。

Even as he thought this, he saw the blood dripping from his hand into the sink suddenly stop, and next second, start to reverse itself as it traveled back into the open wound. Shinji's eyes widened as the blood continued flowing back into the wound, before the folds of skin that had been torn apart and left dangling across his knuckles, suddenly moved as though an invisible hand was guiding them, and placed themselves over the wound. Billions of cells worked in conjunction with each other to connect the flayed pieces of skin, until Shinji was able to look down at his hand and only see white scars where the wound had been.  
正当他这么想着，他看到从他手中滴落到水槽里的血突然停止了，下一秒，血开始逆流，重新回到那敞开的伤口中。真嗣的眼睛睁大了，随着血液继续回流到伤口，那些被撕裂并悬垂在他指节上的皮肤，仿佛被一只无形的手引导着，突然移动并覆盖在伤口上。数十亿细胞协同工作，连接起被剥离的皮肤碎片，直到真嗣低头看向自己的手，只看到伤口处留下的白色疤痕。

Trying not to panic to much, Shinji looked at his own reflection in the mirror and was unsurprised to see that his eyes had turned a blood red. Looking back down at his hand, he turned it over and examined the other side, wondering if the wound hadn't been transferred somewhere else.  
尽量不让自己过于惊慌，真嗣看着镜子中自己的倒影，并不意外地发现他的眼睛变成了血红色。他再次低头看向自己的手，翻转过来检查另一面，想知道伤口是否转移到了别处。

"So looks like I can heal myself somewhat now," Shinji mumbled as his blood red eyes slowly changed back into the brown color that he was normally used to looking at.  
“看来我现在能自我愈合一些了，”真嗣喃喃自语，他那血红色的眼睛慢慢变回了平时习惯的棕色。

'Probably best to not let anybody know about this...including Asuka,' he thought.  
“最好还是别让任何人知道这件事……包括明日香，”他心想。

Turning off the sink faucet, he continued looking at himself in the mirror for a few more seconds before he slowly plodded out of the mens bathroom.  
他关掉水龙头，又在镜子前多看了自己几秒钟，然后才缓缓地走出男洗手间。

At first he thought about simply going back to his room and sleeping, but he found that his feet had a mind of there own.  
起初他想着直接回房间睡觉，但他发现自己的双脚似乎有自己的想法。

After walking down many hallways, during which he thought of little else but Asuka, Shinji found that he was standing in the elevator that would take him down to Unit 01 chamber.  
在走过许多走廊的过程中，他满脑子都是明日香，不知不觉间发现自己已经站在了通往初号机格纳库的电梯前。

He had never done something like this before, having trying to avoid anything to do with Unit 01 unless it was related to battling the angels. Part of it was because deep down, he still resented Unit 01 and everything that it represented, both his fathers part in the creation of the Evangelions, and because of Asuka's long involvement with them.  
他从未做过这样的事，总是尽量避免与初号机有关的一切，除非是与对抗使徒相关。部分原因是他内心深处仍然怨恨初号机及其所代表的一切，包括他父亲在制造 EVA 中的角色，以及明日香与它们长期的关系。

As the doors opened, Shinji glimpsed around briefly, taking in the environment. The first thing he noticed, was that a metal walkway going outward from the doors was floating on what appeared to be LCL fluid. In fact, half the chamber was filled with LCL fluid.  
当电梯门打开时，真嗣迅速环顾四周，观察着环境。他首先注意到的是，从门口延伸出去的金属走道似乎悬浮在 LCL 液体上。实际上，半个格纳库都充满了 LCL 液体。

As Shinji stepped out of the elevator and onto the walkway, he immediately saw Unit 01 in his peripheral vision. As he continued walking, he kept his eyes focused on Unit 01, and if somebody was standing in front of him, he probably would have run into them.  
当真嗣走出电梯踏上走道时，他立刻在视野边缘瞥见了零号机。他继续前行，目光始终锁定在零号机上，如果此时有人站在他面前，他大概会一头撞上去。

Now as he stood in front of Unit 01, he walked slowly forward and placed his hands on the railing that prevented him from falling into the sea of LCL fluid. As he stood there, he felt that he knew why he wanted to be here. The fact that his mother was so close comforted him ways that he realized Asuka couldn't. As he continued looking up at Unit 01, he briefly thought where he would be if his mother had still be alive. He supposed that he never would have met Asuka, which irked him somewhat, but even so...the prospect of a mother in his life still tugged at his heart.  
此刻站在零号机前，他缓缓向前走去，双手搭在栏杆上，以防自己跌入那片 LCL 溶液的海洋。伫立在那儿，他感到自己为何渴望来到这里的原因已了然于心。母亲如此接近，以一种他意识到明日香无法给予的方式安慰着他。他继续仰望着零号机，脑海中闪过一丝念头：如果母亲还活着，他会身处何方？他猜想自己永远不会遇见明日香，这让他有些烦躁，但即便如此……生活中有母亲的影子仍牵动着他的心弦。

Shinji must have been in a daze for a while, because he didn't hear when the elevator doors on the opposite side of the walkway opened with a snap.  
真嗣一定恍惚了好一阵子，因为他没听到对面走道上的电梯门咔嚓一声打开。

After a few seconds though, as the sounds of footsteps started to register in his head, he spun his head around, cricking it in the process, and was surprised to see Rei walking towards him.  
然而几秒钟后，随着脚步声开始在他脑海中响起，他猛地转过头，过程中扭到了脖子，惊讶地看到丽正朝他走来。

'Ayanami?' he thought. “绫波？”他心想。

As Rei continued walking towards him, Shinji let his hands off the railing and turned towards her. At first he thought she was going to walk by him, but was openly surprised when she turned towards Unit 01 and gazed at it just as he had done moments before.  
当丽继续向他走来时，真嗣松开了扶手，转向她。起初他以为她会从他身边走过，但当她转向初号机并像他之前那样凝视时，他感到非常惊讶。

After a few minutes of silence, during which Shinji continued looking at her and Rei continued looking at Unit 01, Shinji was about to start a conversation which would have surely dissolved into thin air when Rei surprisingly asked him something.  
在几分钟的沉默之后，期间真嗣一直看着她，丽则继续注视着初号机，真嗣正要开始一段注定会无疾而终的对话，这时丽出乎意料地向他提出了一个问题。

"I'm surprised that you are here Ikari-kun..."  
“我很惊讶你在这里，真嗣君……”

If Rei was surprised to see Shinji here looking at Unit 01, it was nowhere to how Shinji felt about hearing Rei speak first.  
如果说丽对在这里看到真嗣注视着初号机感到惊讶，那么真嗣对丽先开口说话的感受则远不止于此。

Shinji had always been...well not afraid, but...Rei had always seemed strange to him. First he knew about her relation with his father, which he couldn't understand. Though admittedly he had never really thought of trying to know why she cared for him so. Second...well he honestly never got to know her very well, being so absorbed in living with Asuka and his own problems. But he was also...curious about her, because she felt different to him than anybody else who he had ever met, as though she was like _him_ in some way.  
真嗣一直觉得...好吧，不是害怕，但...丽对他来说总是显得很奇怪。首先，他知道她和父亲的关系，这让他无法理解。虽然坦白说他从未真正想过要去了解她为何如此关心他。其次...好吧，他确实从未真正了解过她，因为他太专注于和明日香一起生活以及自己的问题。但他也对丽感到好奇，因为她给他的感觉与其他任何他遇到过的人都不同，仿佛她在某种程度上和他很相似。

Coming out of his sudden thoughts, he turned to her with a blank expression on his face and said, "What I'm...doing here..."  
从突如其来的思绪中回过神来，他转向她，脸上带着茫然的表情说道：“我在这里...做什么...”

Rei continued looking back at him with the usual expression on her face.  
丽继续用她一贯的表情看着他。

Feeling slightly embarrassed by his response to her question, Shinji turned away from her quickly. How was it that it was harder to talk to her then it was to Asuka?  
被她的问题弄得有些尴尬，真嗣迅速转过身去。为什么跟她说话比跟明日香说话还难呢？

'Well thats simple,' he replied to his own question. 'You can easily talk to Asuka because you've been around her so much. Ayanami...not so much.'  
“嗯，这很简单，”他自问自答道，“你能轻松地跟明日香交谈，是因为你跟她相处了很久。绫波……就没那么多了。”

Continuing to look away from her, Shinji glanced briefly at Unit 01 out of the corner of his eye and wondered what Asuka would have said if she could have seen him all flustered.  
继续避开她的目光，真嗣用眼角瞥了一眼零号机，心里想着如果明日香能看到他这副慌张的样子会说些什么。

'Probably would have become jealous and hit me,' he thought as a smile started to spread over his face.  
'大概会嫉妒然后打我吧，'他想着，脸上开始浮现出微笑。

Feeling slightly better, he turned back to Rei and said, "I've never been here before, trying to forget about Unit 01 as much as possible when I wasn't inside of it. I suppose I...well Asuka's of course taking her synchronization test right now, and Misato didn't want me there, so I just sorta...ended up here."  
感觉稍微好些了，他转身对丽说："我以前从未来过这里，不在初号机里的时候，我尽量不去想它。我想我...嗯，明日香当然正在做同步测试，而美里不想让我在场，所以我只是...就来到了这里。"

Rei was silent as Shinji finished.  
丽在真嗣说完后沉默不语。

"How come you're here though Ayanami?" asked Shinji suddenly.  
“你怎么会在这里呢，绫波？”真嗣突然问道。

Rei seemed to pause for a moment before she said, "I sometimes come here by myself," she said quietly.  
绫波似乎顿了一下，然后轻声说道：“我有时会自己来这里。”

Shinji was rather surprised at her response and raised an eyebrow.  
真嗣对她的回答颇为惊讶，挑了挑眉毛。

"How come? Isn't it kinda...lonely?"  
"怎么会呢？不是有点...孤单吗？"

"...Lonely? No...not really. Unit 01 is here after all," she said while gesturing towards the giant head of the Eva that was perturbing out of the LCL fluid.  
"...孤单？不...倒也不至于。毕竟零号机在这里，" 她一边说一边指向从 LCL 液体中不安地探出头来的巨大 Eva 头部。

"Unit 01?" asked Shinji surprised that she would say such a thing. Did she know what the Eva's contained? And speaking of which...what soul was inside her Eva, Unit 00?  
"零号机？" 真嗣惊讶于她会这么说。她知道 Eva 里有什么吗？说到这个...她的 Eva，零号机里又是什么灵魂呢？

"Yes," said Rei emotionlessly as she continued looking at Unit 01.  
"是的，" 丽面无表情地继续注视着 01 号机。

Shinji follow her gaze, and looked into the eyes of his Eva, wondering if his mom could see him.  
真嗣顺着她的目光望去，凝视着自己 EVA 的眼睛，不知道母亲是否能看到他。

"Hey umm Ayanami...?" "那个，绫波...？"

"Yes Ikari-kun?" “有什么事吗，碇君？”

"...You can call me Shinji you know...everybody else does."  
“……你可以叫我真嗣的，你知道的……大家都这么叫我。”

Shinji tore his eyes way from Unit 01 and directed them at Rei, who he was surprised to see was also looking back at him.  
真嗣将目光从初号机上移开，转向了绫波，令他惊讶的是，绫波也在看着他。

"Err...Ayana-" "呃...绫奈-"

"Shin...ji...kun." "真...嗣...君。"

"You can drop the 'kun' you know," Shinji said quickly. "We know each other and...well as I said, everybody calls me just Shinji so...  
"你可以不用加‘君’的，" 真嗣迅速说道。"我们彼此认识，而且...就像我说的，大家都直接叫我真嗣...

Rei nodded slightly to indicated that she understood. Turning back to Unit 01, she said, "You wanted to ask me something?"  
丽微微点头表示她明白了。转回初号机前，她说：“你想问我什么？”

Shinji started, momentarily forgetting what he had originally wanted to ask her before they got sidetracked with the way she addressed him.  
真嗣一惊，一时忘了他原本想问她什么，之前被她对他的称呼带偏了话题。

"How do you...get along so well with my father?" he finally managed to say.  
“你是怎么……和我父亲相处得这么好的？”他终于说出口。

"Your father?" "你的父亲？"

"Yeah," said Shinji as he nodded.  
"是的，" 真嗣点头说道。

Rei seemed to think about that for a moment before she said, "I don't understand what you mean by that. The commander is...kind to me, and so I am also kind to him."  
绫波似乎思考了一会儿，然后说："我不明白你这么说的意思。指挥官对我很好，所以我对他也很好。"

"But I mean...I've seen you talking to him, more adamantly then you normally do."  
"但我的意思是...我见过你和他交谈，比你平时更加坚决。"

Rei was silent for a moment as she pondered what Shinji meant, and after giving her a few seconds Shinji continued.  
零沉默了一会儿，思考着真嗣的意思，给她几秒钟后，真嗣继续说道。

"Myself, I've never cared for him. He abandoned me when I was a kid, went to work with Nerv I suppose now that I think about everything. Part of me always wished that I had his love...or at least his respect. I suppose you could say that I'm...envious of you, because he seems to care for you more than he does me, his own son."  
"我自己，从来没在乎过他。他小时候就抛弃了我，我想现在一切都想通了，他去和 Nerv 工作了。我总有一部分希望得到他的爱...或者至少是他的尊重。我想你可以说我...嫉妒你，因为他似乎更关心你，而不是我，他自己的儿子。"

"I don't think thats true," said Rei quietly.  
"我不认为那是真的，"丽轻声说道。

Shinji glanced back at her and said, "I don't know what to think about him anymore, nor do I think I really care."  
真嗣回头看了看她，说道："我对他已经没有想法了，我也不觉得我真的在乎。"

"Do you mean that?" "你是这个意思吗？"

"Why shouldn't I? He's been absent in my life for so long, even if he were to make amends for everything he's ever done...I still couldn't forgive him."  
"我为什么不应该？他缺席我的生活太久了，即使他想要弥补他所做的一切...我仍然无法原谅他。"

"Because you hate him?" "因为你恨他？"

"Correct..." "没错..."

"But you don't know how he feels about you."  
"但你不了解他对你的感觉。"

"Does it really matter? Its enough that I don't want any part of him in my life."  
"这真的重要吗？只要我生活中不想有他的任何一部分就够了。"

"Then why do you pilot Eva?"  
"那你为什么要驾驶 EVA？"

Shinji's head swiveled so quickly to look at her that he suffered whiplash as though Misato had just slammed on the brakes of her car. Rubbing the back of his neck, he looked back at Rei only to see that her eyes were fixed unblinkingly on his own.  
真嗣的头猛地转向她，仿佛美里刚刚猛踩了刹车，让他感到颈部一阵剧痛。他揉着后颈，再次看向丽，只见她的目光坚定不移地直视着他。

"Why I pilot...I have my own reasons, as I'm sure you do also," he said trying to avoid the question.  
“我为什么驾驶……我有自己的理由，我相信你也有，”他试图回避这个问题。

Rei continued looking at him unblinkingly for a few more seconds before she turned her eyes back to Unit 01 and said, "A person without a purpose isn't a person."  
丽又目不转睛地看了他几秒钟，然后才将目光转回初号机，说道：“一个没有目标的人，不算是一个人。”

Shinji blinked several times, trying to decipher what she meant by that. After several seconds of failed attempts, Shinji instead asked, "Then why do you pilot?"  
真嗣眨了几次眼，试图理解她那句话的含义。几秒钟的尝试失败后，真嗣转而问道：“那你为什么要驾驶 EVA？”

"Me? ...I pilot to discover who I am..."  
“我？……我驾驶 EVA 是为了寻找我是谁……”

"Who you are? Aren't you Ayanami Rei? Is there anybody else you could be? I mean...well...I know who you are at least."  
“你是谁？你不就是绫波零吗？还能是谁呢？我是说……嗯……至少我知道你是谁。”

Rei looked back at him, and if Shinji was correct in his assumption, her face seemed to show genuine surprise.  
丽回头看着他，如果真嗣的猜测没错，她的脸上似乎流露出真正的惊讶。

"Who am I to you?"  
“我是你的谁？”

"Well...one of the few friends of mine first and foremost, then I suppose that we're both Eva pilots...and we are...somewhat alike."  
“嗯……首先是我为数不多的朋友之一，然后我想我们都是 Eva 驾驶员……而且我们……有些相似。”

"Alike?" "相似吗？"

"I mean..." Shinji trailed off, unsure exactly what he had planned on saying. The honest fact was, that on some level that he could never reach with Asuka, him and Rei were alike in certain ways.  
"我是说..." 真嗣话说到一半就停住了，不确定自己原本打算说什么。事实上，在某些方面，他和绫波有着一种他永远无法与明日香达到的相似之处。

"Never mind," said Shinji, quickly forgetting what they were talking about.  
"算了，" 真嗣说道，迅速忘记了他们刚才在谈论什么。

Rei nodded slightly and continued looking at Unit 01 for a few more seconds before she said, "The fourth child is supposed to be found."  
丽微微点头，又继续凝视着零号机几秒钟后说道：“应该找到第四适格者了。”

Shinji whipped his head around for what felt like the umpteenth time and was about to ask her what she meant by that, but she was already walking past him to the opposite end of the walkway.  
真嗣又一次猛地转过头，这感觉像是第无数次了，他正要问她那话是什么意思，但她已经从他身边走过，向走道的另一端走去。

"Ayanami...what did you mean about the fourth child being found!" he yelled at her retreating back.  
“绫波……你说的第四适格者被找到是什么意思！”他对着她远去的背影喊道。

He may as well have shouted at the sky, for all the answer he got.  
他或许可以对着天空大喊，反正他得到的回应也不过如此。

---

Eventually the hours passed, during which Shinji curled into a ball and fell asleep in front of Unit 01 dreaming about his mother materializing out of Unit 01, Rei's eyes suddenly glowing a bright blood red as she told him his father was dead, Asuka being trapped inside Unit 02 forever, and something that he wasn't able to remember to clearly. For some reason it maybe him think of the fourth child. All to soon though, he felt himself being roughly awakened by hands that were nonetheless smooth, but could cause he great pain at the same time.  
时间最终流逝，其间真嗣蜷缩成一团，在零号机前睡着了，梦见他的母亲从零号机中显现，绫波的眼睛突然闪烁着鲜红的血光，告诉他父亲已经去世，明日香永远被困在二号机内，还有些他记不太清楚的东西。不知为何，这让他想起了第四适格者。然而不久，他便被一双虽然光滑却能带来剧痛的手粗暴地唤醒。

"So this is where you've been the entire time," grumbled Asuka the second one of Shinji's eyes twitched open.  
“原来你一直在这里，”明日香咕哝着，就在真嗣的一只眼睛微微颤动睁开时。

"Test go smoothly then?" asked Shinji, trying to keep the worry in his voice to a minimum.  
"测试进行得顺利吗？" 真嗣问道，尽量将声音中的担忧降到最低。

"Without any problems," she said in such a way that seemed to adhere back to her old self.  
"没有任何问题，" 她这样说道，语气似乎又回到了过去的自己。

A feeble smile flickered across Shinji's features during which he said, "Glad that you're fine."  
真嗣的脸上闪过一丝微弱的微笑，期间他说道："很高兴你没事。"

"Like anything would have happened," she countered. "I'm the best there is. ...So? What were you doing around this pile of scrap metal?" she asked while pointing at Unit 01.  
"能有什么事发生呢," 她反驳道。"我是最棒的。...所以？你在这堆废铁旁边做什么？" 她指着初号机问道。

Shrugging, Shinji said, "Not sure, Misato said that I wasn't allowed to be there for your synchronization test, so I kinda...ended up wandering here."  
耸了耸肩，真嗣说："不太确定，美里说我不允许在你同步测试时待在那里，所以我...就逛到这里了。"

"Yeah I heard that she was afraid that you would affect my concentration somehow. How utterly ridiculous. As if something like that could have broken my concentration." Asuka said this last part a lot less smugly then she had said the sentence before, and they were both briefly reminded of the previous day and everything that had happened between them.  
"是啊，我听说她担心你会以某种方式影响我的专注力。真是荒谬。好像这种事能打破我的专注似的。" 阿斯卡说最后这句话时，语气远没有之前那句那么自负，两人都不禁想起了前一天以及他们之间发生的一切。

"So," said Asuka trying to pull not only herself, but Shinji away from yesterday's events, "Misato wanted me to find you and take you back to her office."  
"那么，" 明日香试图将自己和真嗣从昨天的事件中拉出来，"美里让我找到你，带你回她的办公室。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Not sure, she told me that she had something to tell both of us, and that it was quickest to do it together."  
"不确定，她告诉我她有事要告诉我们俩，而且一起说最快。"

Shinji hesitated for a second before saying, "You don't think she's gonna like...give us a talk or anything...like about-"  
真嗣犹豫了一会儿才说："你不觉得她会...给我们上一课什么的...比如关于-"

"As if I want to hear a woman in her late twenties talking about that kind of stuff," said Asuka with disgust on her face. "And besides...why would you even think she'd want to talk to us about that?"  
"好像我想听一个快三十岁的女人谈论那种东西似的，" 明日香一脸厌恶地说道。"而且...你为什么会认为她会想跟我们谈这个？"

"No reason," said Shinji hurriedly.  
"没理由，" 真嗣急忙说道。"

Asuka looked at him mildly for a few seconds before she sighed and said, "Pervert," hitting him on the head with her fist.  
明日香温和地看了他几秒钟，然后叹了口气说："变态，" 用拳头敲了一下他的头。

---

"School?" asked Shinji with a confused look on his face.  
"学校？" 真嗣脸上带着困惑的表情问道。

"Did you not think that you'd have to continuing going or something?" replied Misato with a surprised look on her face. Asuka, meanwhile, who was standing next to Shinji looked as though she had just swallowed antifreeze. They were again back in Misato's office, having just heard that they were supposed to return to school...today.  
"难道你没想过你得继续上学什么的吗？" 美里带着惊讶的表情回答。与此同时，站在真嗣旁边的明日香看起来像是刚吞了防冻液一样。他们再次回到了美里的办公室，刚刚得知他们应该今天返回学校。

"No, not really," said Shinji in all honesty. "I didn't think that I'd be allowed to go back...not that I ever really wanted to."  
"不，真的没想过，" 真嗣坦诚地说，"我以为我不会被允许回去...并不是说我真的想去。"

"You're still children and as such your education is still important."  
"你们仍然是孩子，因此教育依然重要。"

"I've already been through college," argued Asuka, "and the Japanese school system sucks anyway."  
"我已经上过大学了，""明日香反驳道，""而且日本的学校系统本来就很糟糕。"

"Yes, but you are still woefully inadequate when it comes to recognizing modern kanji. Typical Japanese students know upward of two thousand different kanji characters by graduation. In fact, Shinji knows more characters than you."  
"是的，但你在识别现代汉字方面仍然严重不足。典型的日本学生在毕业时能认识超过两千个不同的汉字。实际上，真嗣认识的汉字比你多。"

"So, he is Japanese. If he didn't know more kanji than me, I'd consider him retarded."  
"这么说，他是日本人。如果他认识的汉字还没我多，那我真要怀疑他是不是智力有问题了。"

"Thanks," whispered Shinji feeling slightly annoyed at her insult. "But isn't school closing soon? Would there be much of a point in going right now?  
"谢谢，" 真嗣低声说道，对她的话感到有些不快。"不过学校不是快关门了吗？现在去还有意义吗？

In response, Misato held up two bags that she had apparently prepared ahead of time.  
作为回应，美里举起了两个显然是事先准备好的袋子。

"I'm your guardian, so if you think about skipping I assure you that I will hear of it. And it wont be just you two either, Rei is returning today also."  
"我是你的监护人，所以如果你考虑逃课，我向你保证我会知道的。而且不只是你们两个，丽今天也会回来。"

"The pet?" asked Asuka with a raised eyebrow. "I thought she was too important for school."  
"宠物？" 明日香挑起眉毛问道。"我以为她对学校来说太重要了。"

Misato chose to ignore her comment and continued.  
美里选择忽略她的话，继续说道。

"While it is almost noon, I thought that it would be good to go anyway since you need to get in the habit of learning again."  
"虽然快到中午了，但我想还是去吧，毕竟你需要重新养成学习的习惯。"

"This is stupid," said Asuka with no attempt at hiding her displeasure.  
"这太蠢了，" 明日香毫不掩饰她的不悦说道。

Again, Misato ignored her comment.  
米萨托再次无视了她的评论。

"On another note...well this is more for Shinji, but you've been cleared for returning to our apartment for the time being."  
“另外……这主要是针对真嗣的，但目前你已被批准返回我们的公寓。”

Shinji felt Asuka stir next to him and had to hold back the urge to turn and grin at her. Instead, he settled on looking mildly puzzled while he asked, "Why the sudden change in...the way I'm viewed?"  
真嗣感觉到身边的明日香动了动，他强忍住转头对她咧嘴一笑的冲动。相反，他装作略显困惑地问道：“为什么突然改变了……对我的看法？”

Misato paused for a moment, wondering if he was angry or not before she said, "For now, its been determined that you're able to return to the apartment...and school. Though I must express you to never use your...AT-field, around other humans."  
美里顿了一下，不确定他是否生气，然后说道：“目前，已经决定你可以返回公寓……以及学校。不过我必须强调，你绝不能在其他人周围使用你的……AT 力场。”

Shinji frowned at her saying, "I have enough common sense to know that already. And its not as though I'm blatantly using it."  
真嗣对她的话皱了皱眉，说：“我有足够的常识，早就知道这一点。而且我并没有明目张胆地使用它。”

"I know but...it is a rather delicate situation. To be honest, Nerv operatives will be maintaining a constant watch on you in case something ever happens."  
“我知道，但是……这是一个相当微妙的局面。老实说，Nerv 的特工将会持续监视你，以防万一发生什么事情。”

"Which it wont," mumbled Shinji under his breath, clearly annoyed at the sudden intrusion into his life...not to mention his time with Asuka.  
"“不会发生的，”真嗣低声咕哝着，显然对生活中突然的侵扰感到恼火……更不用说他和明日香的时间了。”

After that, Shinji wordlessly grabbed one of the bags out of Misato's hands and left the room, leaving Asuka and Misato looking at each other.  
之后，真嗣默默地从美里手中接过一个袋子，离开了房间，留下明日香和美里面面相觑。

Sighing lightly, Asuka said, "Sorry about that. I'll berate him later for this."  
明日香轻轻叹了口气，说道：“抱歉，我稍后会训他一顿的。”

"Don't bother," said Misato as she sat down in her chair and leaned back. "I don't really blame him for feeling annoyed about all this. If I had people watching me every second of my life I'd probably go insane. Honestly, I'm impressed at how well he's handled everything...though I should attribute some of that to yourself. Great job on the test today by the way. Your sync ratio was well above normal values...its better than when you first arrived here actually."  
“别费心了，”美里说着坐回椅子上，向后靠去，“我并不真的怪他感到烦躁。如果我每时每刻都有人盯着，我大概也会疯掉。老实说，我对他能处理好这一切感到惊讶……虽然这其中也有你的一份功劳。顺便说一句，你今天的测试表现很出色。同步率远超正常值……实际上比你刚来这里时还要好。”

Asuka tried to not looked too pleased with herself, but her cheeks did turn slightly pink at what Misato had said about her and Shinji.  
明日香尽量不让自己显得太得意，但听到美里提到她和真嗣时，她的脸颊还是微微泛起了粉红。

"Well I suppose that you should be leaving also," said Misato as she handed Asuka her bag. "Rei will be waiting for you guys at gate four. I'll be back at the apartment between five and six or so, and I'll want an accurate account of what you did at school today."  
“嗯，我想你也该走了，”美里说着把明日香的包递给她，“丽会在四号门等你们。我大概五点到六点之间回公寓，到时候我要知道你们今天在学校都干了些什么。”

"M'kay," nodded Asuka as she took the bag out of Misato's hands and started walking towards.  
“好的，”明日香点点头，从美里手中接过包，开始向门口走去。

"And Asuka," said Misato calling after her.  
"还有明日香，" 美里在她身后喊道。

"Huh?" asked Asuka as she turned around, her flaming red hair spilling over her shoulders.  
"啊？" 明日香转过身来，她那火红的头发披散在肩上。

"Look after Shinji when you can...he's rather hard headed sometimes. But I feel as though you're the only one that he'll listen to."  
"在可能的时候照顾一下真嗣吧...他有时候相当固执。但我觉得只有你才能让他听进去。"

"Will do," said Asuka, anxious not to let Shinji spend more than a few seconds alone with Rei.  
"好的，" 明日香说道，急切地不想让真嗣和绫单独相处超过几秒钟。

---

"So you finally get to leave that stuffy place after being there for so long," said Asuka with a slight smirk on her face.  
"你终于可以离开那个闷闷的地方了，在那里待了那么久，" 明日香脸上带着一丝得意的微笑说道。

"I suppose," replied Shinji, "though being followed around doesn't feel like very much like freedom." As he said this, he had to hold back the urge to look all around him, trying to find anybody that he thought in the least bit suspicious.  
"我想也是，" 真嗣回答，"虽然被人跟着并不怎么像自由的感觉。" 他说这话时，不得不抑制住四处张望、试图找出任何他认为可疑的人的冲动。

Shinji, Asuka, and Rei were walking together down the sidewalks on there way to school. Shinji walked in the middle with Asuka on his right and Rei on his left. Asuka didn't even seem to acknowledge the fact that Rei was with them, trying to always keep Shinji looking at her. Unfortunately for her however, Shinji purposely kept trying to draw Rei into conversation with little success. The most she said was like six words, which he supposed was a considerable amount considering who he was trying to talk to.  
真嗣、明日香和丽一起走在去学校的路上，沿着人行道前行。真嗣走在中间，明日香在他右边，丽在他左边。明日香似乎完全不承认丽的存在，总是试图让真嗣只看着她。然而，真嗣却故意试图把丽拉进对话中，但收效甚微。丽最多只说了六个字，真嗣觉得这已经相当多了，考虑到他试图与之交谈的对象是谁。

"That means you can cook again," said Asuka, in what she hoped wasn't too excited a tone.  
“那意味着你又可以做饭了，”明日香说，她希望自己的语气不要太兴奋。

"What? Nerv food not quite up to your standards?" he asked, completely seeing through her vague statement.  
“什么？NERV 的食物不符合你的标准吗？”他问道，完全看穿了她含糊其辞的陈述。

"Well its not that its bad or anything...you're just a better cook is all," said Asuka, mumbling the last part of the sentence.  
"嗯，并不是说它不好或者怎样...只是你做饭更拿手罢了，" 明日香咕哝着说出了句子的最后部分。

Shinji laughed lightly at that. "Well I can't deny that I'd like something that didn't come in a tray that looked as though I was in the military...which I suppose is kinda ironic. But I suppose its fine...anything you want specifically?"  
真嗣对此轻声笑了笑。"好吧，我不能否认我希望有些不是从那种看起来像我在军队里的托盘里出来的东西...这有点讽刺，不过我想还可以...你有什么特别想要的吗？"

"Nope," she said. "Whatever you decide on is fine."  
"没有，" 她说。"你决定什么都行。"

"I suppose that I should grab a few things after school then. I can't imagine Misato has much in the way of ingredients after me being gone for almost two weeks."  
"我想放学后我应该去买点东西。我不在的这两周，Misato 家里的食材估计也没剩多少了。"

Asuka hesitated for a second before she said, "I'll come with you."  
Asuka 犹豫了一下，然后说："我和你一起去。"

Shinji thought about that for a moment. As much as he'd enjoy spending time with Asuka when nobody was around to interfere, he kinda wanted to do the shopping himself. That and he had something else on his mind.  
Shinji 想了一会儿。虽然他很享受和 Asuka 独处的时光，但他其实更想自己去购物。而且，他心里还有别的事情。

"No...I think I'll go by myself this time."  
"不...这次我想自己去。"

"Oh...okay," said Asuka quietly, not entirely happy with his decision.  
"哦...好吧，" 明日香轻声说道，对他的决定并不完全满意。

Shinji heard the downheartedness in her voice but tried to ignore it.  
真嗣听出了她声音中的失落，但还是试图忽视它。

"C'mon," said Shinji. "If we don't hurry we'll miss class altogether."  
"快点，" 真嗣说。"如果我们不快点，就会完全错过上课了。"

---

School was much the same as Shinji had remembered it...stupid and tedious. The only thing that he was grateful for was that he only had to sit through an hour before the final bell rang. Kensuke and Touji were both glad to see that Shinji was back and seemed to be intact. They seemed to have been under the impression that with the last angel attack, he had lost several limbs. Though of course as they saw him it was obvious they were poorly informed. Even Asuka seemed to have hit it off quickly with Hikari and they were both chatting animatedly through class, though Shinji couldn't help notice the quick glances from Asuka directed at himself. It even seemed that they might be going somewhere after school for a bit. Shinji didn't mind that at all, because considering what he was going to do...well...she'd bight his head off for sure.  
学校和真嗣记忆中的差不多...愚蠢又乏味。他唯一感激的是只需要熬过一个小时，放学铃声就会响起。剑介和东治都很高兴看到真嗣回来了，而且似乎完好无损。他们似乎以为在上次使徒袭击中，真嗣失去了几条肢体。当然，当他们看到他时，显然他们的消息不准确。甚至连明日香似乎也很快和光子打成一片，她们在课堂上热烈地聊着，尽管真嗣注意到明日香不时快速地瞥向他。甚至放学后她们可能还会一起去某个地方。真嗣对此并不介意，因为考虑到他接下来要做的事...嗯...她肯定会大发雷霆的。

After school, Shinji parted with Asuka quickly and shrugged Kensuke and Touji off who had planned on going to the arcade. As if he had time for something like that. Besides, his chief concern right now was Rei.  
放学后，真嗣迅速与明日香分开，甩掉了原本计划去游戏厅的剑介和东治。他哪有时间做那种事。况且，他现在最关心的是丽。

He wasn't sure if it had something to do with what she had said about the fourth child, or because after there brief conversation earlier, he felt drawn to her in some way. Either way, he felt as though he needed to have a long talk with her. So after standing outside the school gates for what felt like an extra hour, he finally heard footsteps behind him and turned to see her walking towards him.  
他不确定这是否与她提到的第四个孩子有关，还是因为在他们之前的简短对话后，他感到某种方式被她吸引。无论如何，他觉得需要与她进行一次长谈。所以在学校大门外站了感觉额外的一小时后，他终于听到身后传来的脚步声，转身看到她正朝他走来。

"I had thought that you might have left," said Shinji naturally as though she was a good friend that he often hung out with.  
“我以为你可能已经离开了，”真嗣自然地说道，仿佛她是他经常一起玩的好朋友。

Shinji waited for a reply from her but didn't get it until she was walking past him.  
真嗣等待她的回复，但直到她走过他身边时才得到回应。

"I was asked to stay behind to clean the classroom," she said quite unnaturally  
"我被要求留下来打扫教室，"她很不自然地说

"If I'd known that I would have helped. You should have asked me."  
"如果我知道的话，我会帮忙的。你应该叫上我。"

Rei was silent as though she hadn't heard him.  
丽沉默着，仿佛没听到他的话。

"Were is the pilot of Unit 02?" she asked instead.  
"二号机的驾驶员在哪里？" 她问道。

Shinji raised an eyebrow at her, surprised that somebody could address a person they worked with in such a formal way.  
真嗣对她扬起眉毛，惊讶于有人能以如此正式的方式称呼他们的同事。

"Who Asuka? She went with Hikari, the class rep."  
"你是说明日香吗？她和班长光一起走了。"

"Why are you not with her?"  
“你为什么没和她在一起？”

"I-" Shinji hesitated. "Well I had some other things that I needed to take care of. I need to get some food for dinner tonight...and I thought I'd talk to you about some...things..."  
“我——” 真嗣犹豫了一下。“嗯，我有些其他事情需要处理。我得为今晚的晚餐准备些食物……而且我想和你谈谈一些……事情……”

"You wanted to talk?" “你想谈谈？”

"Yeah...like what you said about the fourth child."  
"是啊...就像你提到的那第四个孩子。"

"The fourth child?" asked Rei  
"第四个孩子？" 丽问道

"You said that that might have been found."  
"你说过那可能已经被找到了。"

Rei paused for a moment before she said, "Captain Katsuragi may know more."  
丽停顿了一下，然后说道：“葛城队长可能知道更多。”

"Who chooses us?" “是谁选择了我们？”

"Us?"

"People like us...children pilots I mean. I had heard before that Touji had been a candidate at one point, but nothing ever came of it."  
“像我们这样的人...我是说，儿童驾驶员。我之前听说过，曾经有一段时间，真嗣也是候选人之一，但后来什么也没发生。”

Rei continued walking down the sidewalk in silence, ignoring his question if that was even possible with her.  
丽继续默默地沿着人行道走，无视他的问题，如果这真的可能的话。

Feeling slightly annoyed Shinji instead said, "What is my father planning?"  
感到有些恼火的真嗣反而问道：“我父亲在计划什么？”

Rei paused again, but this time Shinji thought he sensed a slight change in her. Almost as though something was seeping through the cracks of armor that she had erected against her emotions.  
丽再次停下脚步，但这一次，真嗣觉得他察觉到了她身上微妙的变化。仿佛有什么东西正从她情感盔甲的裂缝中渗透出来。

Turning around she said, "Your father? The commander?"  
她转过身来说道：“你的父亲？那位指挥官？”

"I know he's planning something with me...why else would he let me roam freely like this. Though of course he does have people nearby to watch."  
“我知道他正和我计划着什么……否则他怎么会让我如此自由地游荡。当然，他确实在附近安排了人手监视。”

"I do not understand," she said truthfully.  
“我不明白，”她如实说道。

"You don't understand? How could you not, you're always around him?" said Shinji letting his anger towards his father get the better of him. "Why else would he bother running all those tests on me? He doesn't care about me, all he cares about are his stupid projects."  
“你不明白吗？你怎么可能不明白，你总是和他在一起？”真嗣说道，任由对父亲的愤怒占了上风。“不然他为什么要费心给我做那些测试？他根本不在乎我，他只关心他那些愚蠢的项目。”

Rei blinked once as though she was showing surprise and walked slowly towards Shinji who had stopped walking.  
绫波眨了一下眼，仿佛在表现惊讶，然后慢慢地走向真嗣，后者已经停下了脚步。

As Rei got closer, almost as close as he and Asuka had been recently, he noticed that her eyes boor a strange resemblance to his own when he was influenced by his angel self.  
当绫波走近，几乎和他与明日香最近那样近时，他注意到她的眼睛与他受天使自我影响时有着奇怪的相似之处。

'She has the same red eyes I sometimes do,' he thought. 'Almost as though she's-'  
“她的红眼睛和我有时的一样，”他心想，“简直就像她——”

Rei drew her hand back and whipped it forward with a sudden rush of wind, striking Shinji across his left cheek, leaving the skin raw. It was a matter of Rei doing something so completely out of character that Shinji's head didn't spring backwards after she hit him, but instead leaned to the right and stayed there for a second. Shinji's eyes then slowly traveled away from the sidewalk and focused on Rei instead, and if Shinji didn't know any better, he would guess that Rei was shocked by her own actions.  
丽收回手，猛地向前一挥，带起一阵疾风，重重地打在真嗣的左脸上，皮肤顿时红肿。丽做出如此出乎意料的举动，真嗣的头并没有在她击中后向后弹，而是偏向右侧，停留了一会儿。随后，真嗣的目光缓缓从人行道上移开，聚焦在丽身上，如果真嗣不了解情况，他会猜测丽对自己刚才的行为感到震惊。

Clearing his throat loudly, Shinji said, "Um...Ayanami?"  
真嗣大声清了清喉咙，说道：“呃……绫波？”

At first she didn't reply, still confused at how she had reacted. But slowly, she looked at the palm of her hand which had struck Shinji and said quietly, "Your father isn't like that."  
起初她没有回答，仍困惑于自己的反应。但渐渐地，她看着曾扇了真嗣一巴掌的手掌，轻声说道：“你父亲不是那样的。”

Without another word, she bowed before Shinji, turned around, and walked away at a brisk pace. As Shinji saw her leaving, he quickly stretched out his hand in gesture for her to stay, but he would have had better lucky shouting. Slowly his hand dropped down to his side while he quietly rebuked his rash actions.  
她没有再说一句话，向真嗣鞠了一躬，转身快步离开。真嗣见她离去，急忙伸出手示意她留下，但这样做还不如大声呼喊来得有效。慢慢地，他的手垂落到身侧，心中暗自责备自己的鲁莽行为。

'Damn it...well this sucks,' he thought.  
“该死……真是糟透了，”他心想。

Burying his hands in his pockets, he continued standing on the sidewalk for a few minutes, until he finally turned around and decided that he may as well get the groceries for dinner tonight. Though as he started walking in the direction of the nearest supermarket, he paused and looked outward towards the waterfront of downtown Tokyo-3. In the distance, the damage that the angel had managed to inflict could still be seen. The shipyards that littered the Bay of Tokyo-3 were crumbled and the concrete slabs had been tossed to and fro by the angel. Even smaller office building had been completely ripped apart by the angel AT-field and left floating in the water. Shinji couldn't help but be surprised that people hadn't caught onto Nerv's true agenda before this. But he guessed it just proved that people didn't like their daily lives to be interrupted.  
他将双手插进口袋，继续在人行道上站了几分钟，最终转过身来，决定还是去买今晚的晚餐食材。尽管他开始朝着最近的超市方向走去，却突然停下脚步，望向东京-3 市区的海滨。远处，天使造成的破坏依然清晰可见。东京-3 湾的船坞一片狼藉，混凝土板被天使抛来抛去。甚至连较小的办公楼也被天使的 AT 力场彻底撕裂，漂浮在水中。真嗣不禁惊讶于人们之前竟未察觉 NERV 的真实意图。但他猜想，这或许证明了人们不喜欢日常生活被打扰。

'Why do I feel as though I should walk down there?' he wondered. He'd never had any urge to see something like this before. It was the type of thing that Kensuke would enjoy.  
“为什么我觉得应该走下去看看？”他暗自思忖。他从未有过这样的冲动。这种事情，通常是剑介会喜欢的。

"Well whatever," he said into the open air. "I suppose Asuka and Hikari will hang on for a while so I guess I have time to kill."  
“管他呢，”他对着空旷的空气说道，“我想明日香和光会等一会儿，所以我还有时间消磨。”

---

He had rarely been down to the waterfront where the ships docked and supplies were sent to other parts of Japan. He'd never really had a reason until now.  
他很少来到船只停靠的水边，那里是向日本其他地区输送物资的地方。直到现在，他才真正有了理由。

As he turned the corner around a small office building, he could see the devastation that lay just ahead of him. Much of Tokyo-3 rested on sedimentary rock, meaning that the ground was rather unstable in certain parts. The waterfront in particular had been created by moving dirt from many of the mountains that littered the landscape of Tokyo-3. Something of a makeshift offshoot of the mainland had been created specifically to transport goods and maintain the growing need of supplies as more and more people moved to Tokyo-3. Needless to say, the instant the angel attacked this part of Tokyo-3, the entire infrastructure crumbled. While much of Tokyo-3 rested on moving metallic plates which could retract inside the Geofront if need be, the waterfront had not had this security measure installed.  
当他绕过一座小办公楼转过拐角时，眼前的景象让他目瞪口呆。东京-3 的大部分地区都建立在沉积岩上，这意味着某些地方的地基相当不稳定。特别是水边地区，是由从东京-3 众多山脉中移来的泥土堆积而成。这片临时延伸出的陆地，专门用于运输货物并维持日益增长的人口对物资的需求。不用说，天使一攻击东京-3 的这一部分，整个基础设施就瞬间崩塌了。虽然东京-3 的许多地方都建立在可移动的金属板上，必要时可以缩回地下前线，但水边地区并未安装这种安全措施。

Standing several blocks away from the waterfront, Shinji could just see towering pieces of metal which he guessed were once part of large warehouses. Continuing to walk downward, he saw several cars pass by him, but didn't take any notice of him. Along the waterfront, a strip of pavement ran along the waterfront, making a half circle around the entire city before disappearing through a tunnel and into the mountains where it likely joined up with Tokyo-2.  
站在离水边几个街区远的地方，真嗣勉强能看到一些高耸的金属构件，他猜测这些曾是大型仓库的一部分。继续向下走去，几辆车从他身边驶过，却并未注意到他。沿着水边，一条人行道蜿蜒伸展，绕过整个城市半圈后，穿过一条隧道消失在山中，很可能与东京-2 区相连。

As Shinji reached this road, he crossed and looked over the embankment down into the ruin of the waterfront. Twisted pieces of metal stuck out of the water on what the docks used to rest on. Much of the bay was congealed with loose pieces of wood that were splintered on both ends. Several craters littered the embankment that Shinji was standing on, and he took several hasty steps back in fear of the dirt giving way. Outwards a ways into the bay, a large barge lay tipped on its side while a large hole in the aft end of it leaked oil and took on water. All that was left of the large warehouses were the foundations, as the concrete had flown through the air and sunk to the bottom of the bay. Overall, it wasn't a very happy reminder of what could have been.  
当真嗣走到这条路上时，他跨过去，俯视着河岸下的废墟。扭曲的金属碎片从原本码头所在的水中伸出。海湾的大部分被松散的木片凝结，两端都裂开了。真嗣所站的河岸上有几个弹坑，他急忙后退几步，生怕泥土塌陷。向海湾外延伸一些，一艘大型驳船侧翻着，船尾有一个大洞，漏油并进水。那些大型仓库只剩下地基，混凝土已经飞散并沉入海湾底部。总的来说，这不是一个令人愉快的回忆，提醒着可能发生的事情。

Walking closer now, Shinji peered over the edge and thought he saw a way to get down without sinking into any of the pits. And so, ducking under the yellow security tape that he completely ignored, he slowly made his way down the embankment.  
真嗣走近了一些，俯视着边缘，心想他找到了一条不至于陷入任何坑洞的路。于是，他完全无视了那条黄色的安全胶带，慢慢地走下河岸。

Reaching the bottom quicker than he intended, he hit the hard ground and ran forward, the speed that he had gain going down the hill still present, before he slowed to a jog and finally into a walk.  
他比预期更快地到达底部，重重地摔在地上，随即向前奔跑，下坡时获得的速度依然存在，直到他逐渐减速，改为慢跑，最终变成步行。

He supposed that what he saw intrigued him in someways. The sheer devastation that the angels (and himself) inflicted on the landscape hardly ever crossed his mind. And here, he hadn't even been involved with the battle yet.  
他想，他所见之景在某种程度上确实引起了他的兴趣。天使（和他自己）对这片土地造成的彻底破坏，他很少会去思考。而在这里，他甚至还未参与战斗。

Walking forward a little more, he grabbed a small piece of what he guessed at one time had been a slab of concrete, and threw it with all his might through the air until it eventually dropped and splashed into the water.  
他又向前走了几步，捡起一小块他猜测曾经是混凝土板的东西，用尽全力将其抛向空中，直到它最终落下，溅入水中。

"I wouldn't do that...you'll disturb the fish," said a voice to his left.  
"我不会那么做...你会吓到鱼的，"一个声音从他的左边传来。

Shinji jumped so badly that for a second his feet left his shoes. Spinning around to his left, he saw what he had missed before. A twisted piece of metal was standing erect out of the water. It twisted straight upwards for a while until it curved inward, creating a C like shape. Sitting with his back again this C shape was a boy of around Shinji's age. His hair was white, tinged with very small strands of grey. His clothes were much the same as Shinji's: boring white with matching black pants. But his eyes, thats what first put Shinji on guard. His eyes were the same as Rei's, the same as his sometimes. But for all Shinji's sudden skepticism, he was still curious. He was certain he had not sensed anybody else's presence except his own until just now. It was almost as though this boy suddenly appeared out of thin air.  
真嗣吓得跳了起来，有那么一瞬间他的脚离开了鞋子。他转身向左看去，看到了之前忽略的东西。一块扭曲的金属直立在水面上，向上延伸了一段时间后向内弯曲，形成了一个 C 形。一个和他年纪相仿的男孩背靠着这个 C 形坐着。他的头发是白色的，夹杂着几缕灰丝。他的衣服和真嗣的差不多：单调的白色上衣配黑色裤子。但他的眼睛，这才是让真嗣首先警觉的原因。他的眼睛和绫波零的一样，有时也和自己的一样。尽管真嗣突然产生了怀疑，但他仍然感到好奇。他确信直到刚才为止，除了自己之外他没有感觉到任何其他人的存在。这个男孩几乎就像是凭空出现的。

"Why?" asked Shinji. "为什么？"真嗣问道。

"Because they're living on this planet just as you and I are."  
“因为他们和我们一样，都生活在这个星球上。”

Shinji was silent for a second after this vague explanation until he finally asked, "Who...are you?"  
在听了这个模糊的解释后，真嗣沉默了一会儿，最终问道：“你……是谁？”

The boy turned to him and with a small smile said, "Me? I am Kaoru, Nagisa Kaoru."  
男孩转向他，带着一丝微笑说：“我？我是渚薰，渚薰。”

Shinji frowned at the name. It was Japanese, but the boy didn't look the least bit Japanese.  
真嗣对这个名字皱了皱眉。这是日本名字，但那男孩看起来一点也不像日本人。

"...What are you doing here?" Shinji asked.  
"...你在这里做什么？" 真嗣问道。

"The same thing you're doing I suppose," he replied, still smiling away. "Enjoying the time you have to yourself."  
"我想和你做的一样，" 他回答道，依旧笑容满面。"享受你自己的时光。"

Shinji was rather surprised at that. Was that why he had taken this unexpected detour? To have some time by himself?  
真嗣对此颇为惊讶。难道他选择这条意外的绕道，就是为了能有片刻独处的时间吗？

"How do you know that?" asked Shinji.  
“你怎么知道的？”真嗣问道。

"I can't think of any other reason a person would be here."  
“我想不出还有其他理由一个人会来这里。”

"...But you're here?" "...但你在这里？"

"Yes I am. Just as you are here. Just as the fish are here. Just as everything will be here when the Lilim are gone."  
"是的，我在这里。正如你在这里，正如鱼在这里。正如一切都会在这里，当莉莉姆消失之后。"

The word seemed to jog a memory in his mind, a very pale memory for some reason, as though he was seeing it through very foggy glasses.  
这个词似乎触动了他记忆中的某个角落，不知为何，那记忆非常模糊，仿佛他是透过一层浓雾在看它。

"Lilim?" "莉莉姆？"

Kaoru was silent for a minute in response to Shinji's question, while Shinji started thinking, 'This is kid is kinda weird...'  
面对真嗣的问题，薰沉默了一会儿，而真嗣则在想，‘这孩子有点奇怪...’

"Humans if you prefer then. Humans will be gone long before anything else disappears."  
"如果你愿意，说是人类也行。人类会比其他任何东西都更早消失。"

"...But you're a humans yourself."  
"...但你也是人类啊。"

"True...very true," mumbled Kaoru more to himself than anything.  
"确实...非常确实，" 薰低声自语，与其说是在对别人说，不如说是在自言自语。"

Standing up suddenly, he jumped down from the metal beam he had been resting on, turned towards Shinji and said, "Everything passes by sooner or later...Ikari Shinji-kun."  
他突然站起身，从休息的金属梁上跳下，转向真嗣说道："一切终将过去，迟早而已...碇真嗣君。"

Shinji's eyes widened at that, but suddenly he felt like he had known this person for a long time.  
听到这话，真嗣的眼睛睁大了，但突然间他感觉自己好像已经认识这个人很久了。

"How do you know me?"  
“你怎么认识我？”

Kaoru laughed lightly at that. "You don't set much store by you...do you Ikari-kun?"  
薰对此轻声笑了笑。“你不太看重自己……是吧，碇君？”

Shinji narrowed his eyes slightly and said, "Its Shinji, and where have you heard of me?"  
真嗣微微眯起眼睛，说道：“我是真嗣，你从哪儿听说过我？”

"Where else but Nerv," said Kaoru as he smiled. "I'm the fourth child after all."  
“除了 NERV 还能是哪儿，”薰微笑着说，“毕竟我是第四适格者。”

Shinji had to do a double take at that.  
真嗣听到这话不得不愣了一下。

"...What did you say?" "...你说什么？"

"I am the fourth child. I am a pilot like you."  
"我是第四个孩子。我和你一样，是一名飞行员。"

Walking towards him, Kaoru stuck out his hand and said, "I look forward to working with you Shinji-kun."  
走向他，薰伸出手说：“我很期待与你合作，真嗣君。”

Shinji continued looking at him for a few seconds longer, before he unclenched his right hand and placed it in Kaoru's right hand.  
真嗣又盯着他看了几秒钟，然后松开右手，放在薰的右手上。

"Likewise," mumbled Shinji, never taking his eyes off of Kaoru's blood red eyes.  
“一样。”真嗣咕哝着，目光始终未离开薰血红色的眼睛。

---

"What happened?" asked Asuka the minute Shinji walked over the threshold of Misato's apartment. "You took forever to get back home."  
“发生什么事了？”真嗣一踏进美里公寓的门槛，明日香就问道，“你花了这么久才回家。”

"Sorry," mumbled Shinji. "I got...sidetracked."  
"对不起，" 真嗣咕哝道。"我……走神了。"

"Misato was wondering where you went...well, both of us were I suppose."  
"美里在想你去哪儿了……嗯，我想我们俩都在想。"

"Sorry," mumbled Shinji again.  
"对不起，" 真嗣再次咕哝道。"

It was well after five o'clock and already passed dark when Shinji finally made his way back to the apartment. After his strange conversation with Kaoru, he had a lot on his mind and ended up wandering the streets of Tokyo-3 for several hours. But no matter what Kaoru had said, Shinji kept on returning to the eyes that were so much like Rei's...so much like his own.  
时针早已过了五点，夜色也已深沉，真嗣终于回到了公寓。与薰那场奇异的对话后，他的思绪纷乱，不知不觉在第三新东京市的街头徘徊了数小时。但无论薰说了什么，真嗣总是不由自主地回想起那双酷似丽、又似他自己的眼睛。

Walking into the kitchen, Shinji saw that Misato was already sitting there in a tank top and shorts and was drinking a beer.  
走进厨房，真嗣看到美里已经穿着背心和短裤坐在那里，手里还拿着一罐啤酒。

"What happened to dinner?" asked Misato with a raised eyebrow.  
“晚饭呢？”美里挑着眉问道。

Shrugging Shinji said, "I lost track of time."  
耸了耸肩，真嗣说：“我没注意时间。”

Sighing Misato said, "Well its a good thing that me and Asuka ate already."  
叹了口气，美里说：“还好我和明日香已经吃过了。”

Turning around to face Asuka, Shinji asked, "You ate already?"  
转身面对明日香，真嗣问道：“你已经吃过了？”

"Well...me a Hikari went out shopping and she was kinda hungry after a while, so we both got something to eat." After a few seconds in which Asuka saw the look that Shinji was giving her she said, "What? Its not like I was bound by what I said earlier."  
"嗯...我和光出去购物，过了一会儿她有点饿了，所以我们俩就一起吃了点东西。" 几秒钟后，看到真嗣投来的目光，明日香补充道，"怎么了？我又没被之前说的话束缚住。"

"Well no but...what about you then Misato?"  
"好吧，没有但是...那你呢，美里？"

"I ended up eating with Ritsuko and...Kaji while at Nerv."  
"我在 NERV 和律子还有...加持一起吃了饭。"

"Well at least I don't have to worry about running down to the convenience store and getting anything," mumbled Shinji as he sank into one of the kitchen chairs across from Misato.  
"至少我不必担心跑到便利店去买什么东西了，" 真嗣咕哝着，一屁股坐在厨房对面的一把椅子上，面对着美里。

Walking around to the other of the kitchen table, Asuka sank likewise into a chair and asked, "So where'd you go."  
绕到厨房桌子的另一边，明日香同样坐进一把椅子，问道："那么，你去哪儿了？"

"I...actually went down to the waterfront..."  
"我……实际上是去了海滨……"

Misato who had been halfway to taking a sip of her beer suddenly lowered it from her lips and asked, "Why'd you go there?"  
美里刚要喝一口啤酒，突然停下，将杯子从唇边移开，问道：“你为什么要去那里？”

"Not sure...just wanted to think about some things I guess."  
“不太确定……只是想思考一些事情吧。”

"Well its not safe down there...didn't you see the yellow security tape."  
“那里不安全……你没看到那些黄色的警戒胶带吗？”

"Yes, and I can handle myself."  
"是的，我能照顾好自己。"

"Thats what I'm afraid of," sighed Misato as she took a large gulp of beer.  
"这正是我所担心的，" 美里叹了口气，猛灌了一大口啤酒。

"So we have to go to school again tomorrow?" asked Asuka without much hope.  
"所以我们明天还得去上学？" 明日香带着不多的希望问道。

"Yes, and while we're on the subject, Shinji you still haven't told me about your day at school."  
"是的，而且既然我们谈到了这个话题，真嗣你还没告诉我你在学校的一天呢。"

"Won't it just be the same as Asuka's..."  
"不会和明日香的一样吗……"

"Not necessarily." "不一定。"

"Just tell her about it already!" said Asuka becoming annoyed as she stood up and vacated to the living room.  
“你就直接告诉她不就得了！”明日香不耐烦地说着，站起身走向客厅。

Shinji waited until Asuka was out of ear shot and until he could hear the T.V. blaring before he said, "Misato I have something else that I wanted to tell you."  
真嗣等到明日香的脚步声远去，直到能听到电视的轰鸣声时，才开口说道：“美里小姐，我还有件事想告诉你。”

"Without Asuka here?" “没有明日香在场？”

"Preferably...yes." "最好是...是的。"

"...So what is it?" "...那是什么？"

"Have you...heard anything about the fourth child?"  
"你...听说过第四个孩子的事吗？"

Misato blinked several times before she drained her beer and slammed it down on the kitchen table. Thankfully, Asuka didn't think anything of it since Misato normally did that after drinking a beer.  
美里眨了几次眼，然后喝干啤酒，砰的一声放在厨房桌上。幸好，明日香并未在意，因为美里通常喝完啤酒后都会这么做。

"...Why do you want to know?" she asked hesitantly.  
“……你为什么想知道？”她犹豫地问道。

"Because I...well I met him," said Shinji throwing caution to the winds.  
“因为我……嗯，我见过他，”真嗣豁出去地说道。

"...And? How did he seem to you?"  
"...然后呢？他给你的感觉如何？"

"I don't know...he's different then the rest of us...even Ayanami."  
"我不知道...他和我们其他人不一样...甚至和绫波也不同。"

Misato then sighed, standing up and taking her beer with her. Tossing it in the recycling bin next to the kitchen she walked over to the sink and turned to faucet on full force. Turning back around, she said to Shinji while leaning against the counter, "I don't know much about him...but be wary of him."  
美里随后叹了口气，站起身来拿着她的啤酒。她把它扔进了厨房旁边的回收箱，然后走到水槽边，将水龙头开到最大。转过身来，她靠在台面上对真嗣说："我对他了解不多...但你要小心他。"

"...Do you know something about him that I don't?"  
"...关于他，你是不是知道些什么我不知道的？"

Misato paused for a minute before she said, "Do you know about Seele?"  
美里顿了一下，然后说：""你知道 Seele 吗？""

"Vaguely," replied Shinji.  
""略有所闻，"" 真嗣回答道。

"The fourth child comes directly from them...they chose him. All records of a life he may have had have all been erased. He is certainly different then Asuka...but..."  
"第四个孩子直接来自他们...他们选择了他。他可能拥有的一切生活记录都已被抹去。他确实与明日香不同...但..."

"...Is he like me then?" asked Shinji, clearly voicing what Misato had been thinking.  
"...那他像我吗？" 真嗣问道，显然说出了美里心中的疑问。"

Misato shook her head in response. "I don't know for sure. I've heard that his sync ratio is abnormally high like your own, but as for any...exhibition of angel powers I'm not sure. Ritsuko is supposed to run tests on him tomorrow, but I don't think she'll find anything suspicious. The fact that he is directly backed by Seele is what makes me suspicious."  
美里摇头回应。"我不确定。我听说他的同步率异常高，就像你一样，但对于他是否展现出使徒的力量，我不敢肯定。明日是理应对他进行测试，但我认为她不会发现什么可疑之处。正是他直接受到 Seele 的支持，才让我感到可疑。"

"So be careful in other words."  
"换句话说，要小心点。"

"Correct..." "没错..."

"And could you not mention any of this to Asuka?"  
"还有，你能不把这些告诉明日香吗？"

"...Why?" "...为什么？"

"I don't...want her involved in this anymore than she already is."  
"我不想让她再卷入这件事了，她已经够深陷其中了。"

"Shinji she's-" "真嗣，她——"

"I know! She's an Evangelion pilot like me...but even so, certain things she'd be better off not knowing."  
"我知道！她和我们一样是 EVA 驾驶员……但即便如此，有些事情她还是不知道为好。"

"Shinji...I mean...you two are so deeply involved with not only each, but Nerv also, that I can't see the reason in not telling her this. She's gonna find out about it eventually."  
"真嗣...我是说...你们俩不仅彼此关系深厚，还与 NERV 紧密相连，我觉得没有理由不告诉她这件事。她迟早会发现的。"

"I know but..." "我知道但是..."

"Then if you want some personal advice...don't keep secrets from each other."  
"那么，如果你想听点私人建议...不要向对方隐瞒秘密。"

"Is that why you and Kaji split?" asked Shinji.  
"那就是你和加持分手的原因吗？" 真嗣问道。

"...No. If our problems were as simple as that...well this isn't about me and him anyway. Trust comes in many different forms, and keeping secrets is one of those things that can destroy a relationship."  
"...不。如果我们的问题那么简单就好了...不过这毕竟不是我和他的事。信任有多种形式，而保守秘密是其中一种能摧毁关系的东西。"

Shinji was silent for a moment while he contemplated Misato's words.  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，思考着美里的话。

"And you'd better tell her before tonight ends," said Misato as she walked by Shinji, heading towards her own room. "Because chances are that they'll meet tomorrow."  
“你最好在今晚结束前告诉她，”美里走过真嗣身边，朝自己的房间走去，“因为很可能他们明天就会见面。”

As Misato closed the door to her room, Shinji stood up and turned off the faucet that Misato had left running. Turning around, he glanced at the opening to the living room where he could see the glow of the T.V. and hear the blaring of German coming out of it.  
美里关上房门时，真嗣站起身来，关掉了美里忘记关的水龙头。他转过身，瞥了一眼通往客厅的入口，那里电视机的光芒闪烁，还能听到德语的喧闹声。

'Maybe later,' he thought, as he walked towards the bathroom, intent on taking a shower.  
“也许晚点再说吧，”他想着，走向浴室，打算洗个澡。

---

His 'maybe later' thought turned into 'several hours later' as it was well after eleven by the time Shinji got around to telling Asuka about what had happened between himself and Kaoru.  
他的'可能稍后'想法变成了'几个小时后'，因为直到十一点多，真嗣才抽出时间告诉明日香自己和薰之间发生的事情。

After his shower, Shinji felt so relaxed that he had completely forgotten how hungry he was and went straight to his room and eventually fell asleep listening to his SDAT. When he awoke though, the first thing he checked was his alarm clock. Suddenly he scrambled out of the covers that covered his body, and sat bolt upright reaching blinding for the light switch.  
洗完澡后，真嗣感到如此放松，以至于完全忘记了饥饿，直接回到房间，最终听着他的 SDAT 睡着了。然而醒来时，他首先检查的是闹钟。突然，他从覆盖身体的被子里跳出来，直挺挺地坐着，伸手去摸灯的开关。

'Damn it...I overslept,' he thought as he opened the sliding door quietly, so as not to wake anybody that might be sleeping. Peering out, the first thing he noticed was that the T.V. was still on, and yet all the other lights in the apartment were turned off.  
'该死...我睡过头了，'他想着，轻轻地拉开滑动门，以免吵醒任何可能还在睡觉的人。探头出去，他首先注意到的是电视还开着，而公寓里的其他灯都关了。

Tiptoeing out of his room he reached the entrance into the living room and looked in. A late night Japanese game show seemed to be on and a contestant had just won some prize money it seemed, though this was only the second thing that Shinji recognized. On the couch against the left wall was a small figure that was curled into a ball and clearly sleeping. Trying to suppress the laughter that was threatening to explode out of him, Shinji crept a little closer.  
他踮着脚走出房间，来到客厅入口处，向内望去。深夜的日本游戏节目似乎正在播放，一名参赛者刚刚赢得了一些奖金，尽管这是真嗣认出的第二件事。在靠左墙的沙发上，有一个蜷缩成一团的小小身影，显然正在熟睡。真嗣试图压抑住即将爆发的笑声，悄悄地靠近了一些。

Asuka had fallen asleep watching T.V. which didn't surprise Shinji that much since it had happened before. Looking down at her peaceful sleeping face, he couldn't help but smile at how serene she looked. But as he continued watching her sleeping face, he noticed that she wasn't wearing the warmest of clothes.  
明日香看着电视睡着了，这并不让真嗣感到太惊讶，因为之前也发生过。他低头看着她平静的睡脸，忍不住微笑，她看起来多么宁静。但当他继续注视她的睡脸时，他注意到她穿的衣服并不太暖和。

'I should get some blankets for her,' he thought before he quietly walked out of the room and opened the small closet that was next to the bathroom.  
‘我应该给她拿些毯子，’他想道，然后悄悄走出房间，打开了浴室旁边的小壁橱。

Fishing one of the larger blankets out of the closet, he walked back into the living room and covered her with it, tucking the corners under the couch cushion. Standing there for a few seconds longer he thought, 'I suppose I can tell her tomorrow anyway...before we go to school.'  
他从衣柜里抽出一条较大的毯子，走回客厅，轻轻地给她盖上，将毯子的角塞进沙发垫下。又站了几秒钟，他心想，‘我想明天再告诉她也行...在我们去学校之前。’

Turning around, he intended to go back into his own room and flop down on his futon when he felt light pressure against the sleeve of the shirt he was wearing. Looking down at the hem of his shirt, he saw that a hand was holding onto it. Trailing up the arm to the face, he saw that Asuka was looking groggily back at him.  
他转过身，打算回自己的房间，倒在榻榻米上，却感到袖子上有轻微的压力。低头一看，发现自己的衣角被一只手抓住了。顺着胳膊往上看，他发现明日香正迷迷糊糊地回望着他。

"What are you doing?" she managed to spit out while her eyes remained half closed.  
“你在干什么？”她勉强挤出一句话，眼睛仍然半闭着。

"Sorry...I thought you were asleep."  
"对不起...我以为你睡着了。"

"Well I _was_ until somebody decided to make a racket and cover me with a giant blanket."  
"本来是睡着的，直到某人决定制造噪音还用大毯子把我盖住。"

"I figured you were cold..."  
"我以为你冷..."

"Forget it," said Asuka as she sat up. "I'm awake now and I assume that you didn't just come out here in the middle of the night to watch me sleep."  
"算了吧，" 明日香坐起身说，"我现在醒了，我猜你不会大半夜跑出来就为了看我睡觉。"

"You're the one that decided to fall asleep while watching T.V."  
"是你自己决定看电视时睡着的。"

"I only fell asleep because I was waiting for you!"  
"我睡着是因为在等你！"

It took Asuka's words a few seconds to sink in before Shinji asked, "What?"  
碇真嗣过了几秒才反应过来明日香的话，问道："什么？"

"Are you deaf? I said I was waiting here for you...why didn't come in here after you took your shower?"  
"你是聋了吗？我说我在等你...你洗完澡后为什么不进来？"

"I...I don't know really. I guess I felt tired."  
"我...我真的不知道。我想我可能是累了。"

Asuka had to refrain from snorting.  
明日香不得不忍住不发出嗤笑。

"So...why were you waiting for me?" Shinji asked in attempted conversation.  
“那么……你为什么在等我？”真嗣尝试着开启对话问道。

"...Because we hardly talked to each other today. First it was the test, then we had to walk to school together with the pet, and afterwards we both did our own things after school."  
“……因为今天我们几乎没怎么说话。先是测试，然后我们不得不和宠物一起步行去学校，放学后我们又各自忙自己的事情。”

"Err...am I understanding that you missed spending time with me together."  
"呃...我是不是理解错了，你是因为错过了和我一起度过的时光而感到遗憾。"

"Is that a problem?" asked Asuka with a trace of anger in her voice.  
"这有什么问题吗？" 明日香的声音中带着一丝怒气问道。

"Not at all," replied Shinji hurriedly. "Its just...the old you never would have said something like this."  
"一点问题也没有，" 真嗣急忙回答。"只是...过去的你绝不会说出这样的话。"

"Whats that supposed to mean!" she asked getting sincerely angry this time.  
“那是什么意思！”她这次真的生气了。

"Just that you're more opening towards me than you ever used to be."  
“只是说你对我比以前更开放了。”

Silence ensued between them at Shinji's last words.  
在真嗣的最后一句话后，他们之间陷入了沉默。

"I suppose I am more open than I used to be," said Asuka as her anger subsided. "Though I think the blame has to be laid on you." Turning towards Shinji, she said, "Annoying as it has been sometimes having to deal with you every day...I'm different because of you...and its made me a better person."  
"我想我现在比以前更开放了，"明日香怒气消退后说道，"不过我觉得这得怪你。"她转向真嗣，说，"虽然有时候每天都要应付你真的很烦人...但因为你，我变了...这让我变得更好了。"

"Thanks...I think." "谢谢...我想。"

"...Moron," sighed Asuka as she hit him lightly in the shoulder.  
"...笨蛋，"明日香叹了口气，轻轻地在他肩膀上打了一下。

"I do have something to say to you actually, instead of just staring at your sleeping face."  
"其实我确实有话要对你说，而不是只盯着你的睡脸。"

Asuka narrowed her eyes and said, "Watch it. I may be less abrasive, but I don't want to hear crap like that."  
明日香眯起眼睛说道：“小心点。我可能没那么刻薄，但不想听到那种废话。”

Shinji rolled his eyes slightly before he continued.  
真嗣微微翻了个白眼，然后继续说道。

"Anyways...well I want you to promise me that you'll keep in mind what I'm about to say."  
“总之……我希望你记住我接下来要说的话。”

Asuka frowned at him for a second before she said, "Is this really necessary?"  
明日香皱着眉头看了他一会儿，然后问道：“这真的有必要吗？”

"I wouldn't have woken you up if I had thought this was important..."  
“如果我觉得这不重要，就不会叫醒你了……”

"So tell me what it is already?"  
“那就快告诉我是什么事吧？”

"Asuka...you have promise me first."  
"明日香...你先答应我。"

"Okay fine! I promise to keep in mind whatever you're about to tell me," said Asuka with about as much enthusiasm as pulling teeth.  
"好吧，好吧！我答应会记住你即将告诉我的事情，" 明日香说道，语气之勉强堪比拔牙。

Shinji looked at her for a while longer, determining whether she was serious over what she had promised.  
真嗣又盯着她看了一会儿，判断她对自己所承诺的事情是否认真。

"Well...I wasn't entirely honest earlier...about being down at the waterfront."  
"嗯...我之前没有完全说实话...关于我在码头上。"

"So what? You were doing something else then?"  
"那又怎样？那你当时在做别的事情吗？"

"Well no...I mean...I was down at the waterfront, but I met somebody there."  
"呃，不是...我是说...我确实在码头上，但我遇到了一个人。"

Asuka paused for a second before she asked with a frown on he face, "You weren't with the pet were you."  
明日香顿了一下，皱着眉头问道，“你没和那宠物在一起吧。”

"No, of course not," said Shinji hurriedly. Though he'd no sooner tell Asuka that he talked with Rei after school then ask his father for an increase in his wages.  
“不，当然没有，”真嗣急忙说道。虽然他宁愿告诉明日香放学后和丽聊过天，也不愿向父亲要求加薪。

"I met...well I met the fourth child."  
“我遇到了……呃，我遇到了第四适格者。”

"...The fourth...what?" "...第四个...什么？"

"Kaoru...Nagisa Kaoru is his name..and he's like us. A pilot I mean."  
"薰...渚薰是他的名字..他跟我们一样。我是说，他也是一名驾驶员。"

"Why are you telling me this exactly? This is something that I would have found out for myself eventually you know."  
"你为什么要告诉我这个？这种事情我迟早会自己发现的，你知道的。"

"He's...I don't know how to describe him really. He's not like you...but he may be like me."  
"他……我真的不知道该怎么形容他。他不像你……但他可能像我。"

Asuka hesitated for a second before she asked, "What do you mean, 'he may be like me?'"  
明日香犹豫了一下，然后问道：“你说的‘他可能像我’是什么意思？”

"He may be able to use an AT-field. I don't know for certain, but Misato seemed to think he was strange."  
"他可能能够使用 AT 力场。我不确定，但美里似乎觉得他很奇怪。"

"You told her about this before me?" asked Asuka slightly accusingly.  
"你先告诉她了，却没告诉我？" 明日香略带责备地问道。

"I wanted to know what she thought..."  
"我想知道她的想法……"

"And so what you made me promise..."  
"所以你让我承诺的……"

"That you'll watch out for him...just...be careful when around him. I don't...trust him."  
"你会照顾他的...只是...在他身边时要小心。我不...信任他。"

"Why though? Why go to all this trouble to just tell me this? You could have done it anytime really."  
"为什么呢？为什么要费这么大劲只为了告诉我这个？你本可以随时告诉我的。"

"I just...I didn't want to keep this from you," said Shinji not entirely truthfully. "And I don't want anything to happen to you because I wasn't honest."  
"我只是...我不想对你隐瞒这件事，" 真嗣不完全诚实地回答。"我不想因为我的不诚实而让你受到任何伤害。"

"Shinji, how many times do I have to tell you, I can take care of myself."  
"真嗣，我得告诉你多少次，我自己能照顾好自己。"

"Yes, I know Asuka...but, the thought of anything happening to you..."  
"是的，我知道，明日香...但是，一想到你可能会出什么事..."

Shinji petered off at the end of his sentence, but he didn't really need to say anything. Asuka understood what he was getting at.  
真嗣的话说到一半就停了，但其实他不需要再说什么。明日香明白他的意思。

"I'll be fine," she said as she placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. "Nothing is going to happen to me."  
"我会没事的，"她一边说，一边将一只手安慰地放在他的肩上。"我不会有事的。"

Shinji nodded, but at the same time felt an unexplainable uneasiness that he could ignore. Placing a hand of his own over Asuka's which was resting on his shoulders, he squeezed her hand gently in understanding.  
真嗣点点头，但同时感到一种无法解释的不安，他可以忽略。他将手放在放在他肩膀上的明日香的手上，轻轻地握住她的手以示理解。

"C'mon...we should probably get to bed," said Asuka the second Shinji's hand left hers.  
"来吧...我们可能该去睡觉了，"真嗣的手一离开，明日香就说道。

"Right," said Shinji, recognizing the subtle hint that Asuka was getting at.  
“好吧，”真嗣说道，他察觉到了明日香话中的微妙暗示。

Getting up off the couch, Shinji and Asuka walked towards there respectable rooms where they both parted with a brief, 'Night.'  
从沙发上起身，真嗣和明日香走向各自的房间，临别时简短地互道了一声‘晚安’。

Inside his own room, Shinji flopped down on his futon and briefly wished that Asuka was sleeping next to him.  
在自己的房间里，真嗣扑倒在榻榻米上，短暂地希望明日香能睡在他身边。

Kaoru sat on top of the tallest building in Tokyo-3 with his legs outstretched and hanging over the side.  
薰坐在东京-3 最高的建筑物顶端，双腿伸直，悬在边缘外。

"So thats Gendo's son...Ikari Shinji huh?" he said to no one in particular. Though someone did answer.  
“那就是源堂的儿子……碇真嗣吗？”他自言自语道。尽管确实有人回应了他。

"Correct," said a deep male voice.  
“没错，”一个低沉的男声说道。

Suddenly from all around him, twelve large black pillars appeared each with the words SEELE and a number written underneath.  
突然间，他四周出现了十二根巨大的黑色柱子，每根柱子上都写着 SEELE 和一个数字。

As the black pillars fully materialized around him, Kaoru thought, 'All things must pass Shinji-kun...including your own existence.  
当黑色柱子完全在他周围显现时，薰想道，'所有事物都会逝去，真嗣君...包括你自己的存在。

### Chapter 21: Severed Memories  
第 21 章：断线的记忆  

**Don't have much to say about this one really. Just read it and tell me what you think.  
关于这个，真的没什么好说的。读一读，然后告诉我你的想法。**

---

"I don't care what you say," replied Touji gruffly at Hikari's suggestion. "Cooking is not something a guy should know. Thats a woman's job."  
"我才不在乎你怎么说，" 东治粗鲁地回应光子的建议，"做饭不是男人该懂的事。那是女人的工作。

"Fine then! I hope you starve when you start living on your own," retorted Hikari angrily.  
"那好吧！希望你开始独立生活时饿肚子，" 光子生气地反驳道。

Shinji, Asuka, and Kensuke simply sighed at the two's usual bickering. In fact, they were something of the new Shinji and Asuka pair.  
真嗣、明日香和健介对这两人的日常斗嘴只是叹了口气。事实上，他们有点像是新的真嗣和明日香组合。

The six of them: Shinji, Asuka, Kensuke, Touji, Hikari, and even Rei, were sitting together on top the roof of the school. After much asking from both Touji and Kensuke, Shinji had relented and made a large boxed bento that had something that everybody liked, including Rei, who Shinji had learned was not fond of meat. It had now been several days since Asuka and Shinji returned to there somewhat daily lives, and they were just starting to get used to being back at school.  
他们六个人：真嗣、明日香、健介、薰、光，甚至还有丽，一起坐在学校屋顶上。在薰和健介的多次请求下，真嗣终于妥协，做了一个大盒便当，里面有每个人都喜欢的东西，包括真嗣了解到不喜欢吃肉的丽。自从明日香和真嗣回到他们有些日常的生活以来，已经过去好几天了，他们刚刚开始适应回到学校的生活。

"Touji wont be living on his own anytime soon," said Kensuke. "Most likely he'll live with his parents years after he finishes middle school."  
“薰近期不会独自生活，”健介说，“很可能他中学毕业后还会和父母住在一起。”

Seconds later, Kensuke was forced to run around the rooftop, as Touji chased after him.  
几秒钟后， Kensuke 被迫在屋顶上四处逃窜，因为 Touji 紧追不舍。

"I have to say Asuka," said Hikari as she grabbed another piece of Takoyaki, "living with Shinji must not be that bad if you get to eat food like this everyday."  
“我得说 Asuka，” Hikari 抓起另一块章鱼烧时说道，“和 Shinji 住在一起肯定不会太糟，如果每天都能吃到这样的食物。”

"Its really not that great," said Asuka, hiding her true feelings.  
“其实没那么好，” Asuka 说着，隐藏了自己的真实感受。

"How did you learn to cook like this Shinji?" asked Hikari.  
“你是怎么学会做这么好吃的饭的，真嗣？” 光问道。

Shrugging he said, "I've had a lot of experience. Ah...Ayanami, more miso soup?"  
他耸耸肩说：“我有很多经验。啊……绫波，再来点味噌汤吗？”

As Shinji leaned towards Rei with the canister of soup in his hand, Asuka couldn't help but frown at the two. Since there return to school, Shinji had been increasingly interacting with Rei more than he ever used to, and quite frankly, it was starting to annoy her. She didn't mind so much if they walked to school together, since her and Shinji usually just talked to each other anyway. But when he asked her if she wanted to have lunch on the roof with the rest of them...well, she showed her displeasure about it.  
当真嗣拿着汤罐向绫波倾斜时，明日香忍不住对两人皱起了眉头。自从他们回到学校后，真嗣与绫波的互动比以往任何时候都多，坦白说，这开始让她感到恼火。她并不介意他们一起走到学校，因为她通常只和真嗣交谈。但当他问她是否想和他们一起在屋顶上吃午饭时……好吧，她表达了自己的不满。

"...Thank you," replied Rei seemingly unsure of herself, still getting used to being included in the group. Since she had slapped Shinji, he had not broached the subject of his father at all towards her. Meanwhile, she was still confused over how she had reacted.  
"...谢谢你," 丽回答道，语气中带着几分不确定，仍在适应被团体接纳的感觉。自从她打了真嗣后，他再也没有向她提起过他的父亲。与此同时，她对自己当时的反应仍感到困惑。

"Did you hear that we were supposed to get a new transfer students today?" asked Kensuke, sitting down now that Touji had worn himself out.  
"你听说了吗，我们今天应该会有新转学生来？" 真希问，现在东治已经筋疲力尽，他坐了下来。

"Isn't a little late in the day? Schools already half over," said Asuka.  
"这都快放学了，不是有点晚吗？学校已经过半了，" 明日香说。

"Well, thats just what I heard," replied Kensuke quickly, not wanting to upset Asuka in any way, seeing as though she wasn't in the best of moods.  
"“呃，那只是我听说的，”真嗣迅速回答，不想以任何方式惹恼明日香，毕竟她现在的情绪不太好。”

Huffing slightly, Asuka mumbled, "Whats the point of getting a new student this late in the year."  
明日香微微哼了一声，嘀咕道：“都这个时候了，还转来一个新学生，有什么意义呢。”

Not quite surprising that he managed to hear her, seeing as how he was right next to her, Shinji said, "I wonder if its a boy or girl?"  
考虑到他就在她旁边，能听到她的话并不奇怪，真嗣说：“不知道是男生还是女生？”

Before Asuka was able to retort angrily at his remark, Touji managed to beat him to it.  
在明日香能愤怒地反驳他的话之前，真嗣抢先了一步。

"I hope its a girl. All the girls in our class are either psychotic, a mother hen, or have horns growing out of their head."  
“我希望是个女孩。我们班上的女生要么是疯子，要么是母鸡，要么头上长角。”

Shinji was able to hold back a snicker, but he wasn't able to do anything for Touji, for both Asuka and Hikari punched him in the gut. Asuka however continued glaring at Shinji, wondering what his opinion on the whole thing was, and constantly flitting her eyes between Shinji and Rei.  
真嗣忍住了笑意，但他无法阻止真嗣，因为明日香和光同时给了他一拳。然而，明日香继续瞪着真嗣，想知道他对这一切的看法，并不时在真嗣和丽之间来回扫视。

"Well, thanks for the lunch anyway Shinji," said Hikari as she stood up, dragging an unconscious Touji with her as she went. Kensuke followed shortly after then, giving Shinji a little mock bow and whispered in his ear his regards over having to deal with Asuka the rest of the day. Shinji simply grimaced back at him, only too aware of scathing look that Asuka was throwing in his direction.  
"好吧，无论如何还是谢谢你的午餐，真嗣。" 光子站起来说道，拖着昏迷的东治和她一起离开。健介紧随其后，向真嗣微微鞠了一躬，低声在他耳边表达了对接下来要应付明日香的同情。真嗣只是苦笑着回应他，非常清楚明日香正向他投来尖锐的目光。

"Well there gone finally," said Asuka as Kensuke closed the door leading back towards the classrooms. "Remind me to kick you if you ever decide to make a lunch everybody can share again."  
"他们终于走了，" 明日香在健介关上通往教室的门后说道。"提醒我一下，如果你再决定做一顿大家都能分享的午餐，我可要踢你了。"

"I thought it was best to just get it out of the way, since Touji and Kensuke weren't gonna let me live peacefully unless they tried my cooking."  
"我觉得最好还是直接解决这件事，毕竟东治和健介不尝尝我的厨艺是不会让我安宁的。"

"Well, don't do it again," said Asuka as she stood up.  
"好了，别再这么做了，"明日香站起身来说道。

"What?" asked Shinji slightly smug, "want to keep my not so great food to yourself?"  
"什么？"真嗣略带得意地问，"想独吞我这不太出色的食物吗？"

Trying to keep her blush at a minimum, Asuka managed to say, "What was I supposed to say? That it was to die for. Its good, but not that good."  
明日香尽量不让自己的脸红得太明显，勉强说道："我该说什么呢？说它美味到令人欲罢不能。确实不错，但也没那么夸张。"

"Yeah, yeah," said Shinji as he stood up. "We should probably start heading back to class. Ayanami ready?"  
“是啊，是啊，”真嗣站起身来说道，“我们大概该回教室了。绫波准备好了吗？”

Asuka's features immediately scrunched up the second Shinji addressed the fact that Rei was still there with them. She had been trying her utmost to ignore her.  
当真嗣提到绫波还在他们身边时，明日香的表情立刻皱了起来。她一直在尽力忽视她。

Shaking her head slowly, Rei said, "I think I'll stay out a while longer."  
绫波缓缓摇头，说道：“我想我还要在外面待一会儿。”

"You sure?" asked Shinji, his prior hesitancy over talking to her mostly gone.  
"你确定吗？" 真嗣问道，之前与她交谈的犹豫大多已消失。

Rei simply nodded her head.  
绫波只是点了点头。

"Well..okay. See you in class then."  
"那好吧……那我们课堂上见。"

Gathering the boxed lunch and chopsticks they had used, he placed them all in a bag he had brought and hoisted it over his shoulder.  
他将用过的便当盒和筷子收集起来，放入带来的袋子中，然后将其扛在肩上。

"Ready?" asked Asuka as she held the door open, revealing the staircase behind.  
“准备好了吗？”明日香一边问，一边推开门，露出后面的楼梯。

Sighing slightly, Shinji said, "...Whenever."  
微微叹了口气，真嗣说：“……随时都行。”

---

After school, Shinji and Asuka ended up walking home alone. Recently, Shinji had convinced Rei to walk home with them, since her apartment was on the way towards there's. But today she had stayed back because of cleaning duties. Normally, Shinji and Asuka were able to talk about almost anything, but Asuka's mood had steadily deteriorated as the day continued, until she lashed out at him with a quick remark, stingy him significantly. Now they walked home as if they looked like an old married couple, conversation having been exhausted long ago during the springtime of their marriage.  
放学后，真嗣和明日香独自走回家。最近，真嗣说服了丽和他们一起走，因为她的公寓也在回家的路上。但今天她因为打扫任务留在了学校。通常，真嗣和明日香几乎什么都能聊，但明日香的情绪随着时间的推移逐渐恶化，直到她突然对他冷言相向，让他感到刺痛。现在他们走回家，就像一对老夫老妻，早已在婚姻的春天耗尽了话题。

But Shinji had more on his mind, and oddly enough it had to do with the transfer student thing. Asuka needn't worry about whether Shinji thought it was a boy or girl, because he thought it could only be one person...Nagisa Kaoru.  
但真嗣心里有别的事，奇怪的是，这和转学生有关。明日香不必担心真嗣认为转学生是男孩还是女孩，因为他认为只可能是一个人……渚薰。

Since that day Shinji had met him, both him, Asuka, and Rei had had two synchronization tests, neither of which they heard anything about the fourth child. Above it all, he had a nagging suspicion (based on what Misato had said) that his father was silently worrying about Kaoru. If he came straight from Seele, and if his assumptions about Seele were correct, Kaoru had been sent as something of an agent to check up on his father and himself. No doubt word of Shinji's...odd prowess would have reached the ears of Seele...whoever they were exactly.  
自从那天真嗣遇见他以来，他和明日香、绫波已经进行了两次同步测试，但都没有听到任何关于第四适格者的消息。最重要的是，他有一种挥之不去的疑虑（基于美里所说的话），他的父亲正在默默地担心着薰。如果薰直接来自 Seele，并且如果他对 Seele 的假设是正确的，那么薰可能是被派来作为某种特工，来检查他的父亲和他自己。毫无疑问，真嗣那...奇特的能力的消息肯定已经传到了 Seele 的耳中...无论他们究竟是谁。

"Hey...Shinji?" asked Asuka suddenly, pulling Shinji out of his train of thought.  
“嘿...真嗣？”明日香突然问道，打断了真嗣的思绪。

Shinji ignored her for a minute, but found that it was virtually impossible when she was walking directly beside him, her eyes focused on his face.  
真嗣一开始没理她，但当她直接走在他的旁边，眼睛紧盯着他的脸时，他发现这几乎是不可能忽视的。

"Hmmm?" he decided to reply, not quite ready to say anything.  
"嗯？" 他决定回应，但还没准备好说什么。

"Why...why...why are you talking to the pet so much!" she managed to yell, voicing what had been troubling her these past few days.  
"为什么...为什么...你为什么要和宠物说这么多话！" 她终于喊了出来，说出了这几天一直困扰她的事情。

It was a matter of Asuka asking him something so strange that Shinji didn't immediately start laughing.  
这是明日香问了他一个如此奇怪的问题，以至于真嗣没有立即笑出声来。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"I mean...you've been talking to her more, including her in stuff we do together, and today; why did you ask her to have lunch with us!"  
"我的意思是...你最近跟她聊得更多了，还让她参与我们一起做的事情，今天；你为什么邀请她跟我们一起吃午饭！"

"Why not? She's like us. She's a fellow pilot."  
"为什么不呢？她跟我们一样。她也是个飞行员。"

"No, she's not like us," said Asuka, shaking her head splendidly. "She's different than us!"  
"不，她跟我们不一样，" 明日香摇着头说，"她跟我们不一样！"

"Then I'm different than you!" yelled Shinji, his anger suddenly flaring up.  
“那我和你不一样！”真嗣大喊道，怒火突然爆发。

"Shinji wha-" “真嗣，怎——”

Turning away from her, Shinji said, "You wouldn't understand what its like to be shunned, to be ignored by everybody. You've always craved attention, and you got it. She's the same as I was...all alone. I can't help it if I want to be her friend, because we both know the pain of loneliness."  
真嗣转过身去，对她说：“你不会明白被排斥、被所有人忽视是什么感觉。你一直渴望关注，也得到了。她和曾经的我一样……孤独一人。如果我想和她做朋友，那是因为我们都深知孤独的痛苦。”

"Shin-" "真-

"What!" “什么！”

"Don't...don't do that to me."  
“别……别这样对我。”

"Do what?" "做什么？"

"Saying I craved attention!" she spat out. "That I don't understand what you felt! I know plenty well what it feels like to be isolated!"  
"说我渴望关注！"" 她愤愤地说道，""说我不懂你的感受！我非常清楚被孤立是什么感觉！"

"Asuka I didn't-" "明日香，我不是那个意思——"

"Forget it," she said as she stalked past him. "I don't want to talk to you anymore."  
"算了吧，"她从他身边快步走过，"我不想再和你说话了。"

"Asuka wait!" "明日香，等等！"

"No I won't," she said as she started to break into a run. But Shinji wasn't going to let her go.  
"不，我不会停下，"她说着开始跑起来。但真嗣不打算让她就这样离开。"

"Asuka!" he said as he grabbed a hold of her wrist.  
"明日香！" 他喊道，同时抓住了她的手腕。

"What!" she snapped at him as she turned to face him. "Let go of me you moron before I kick you in the-"  
"干什么！" 她厉声回应，转身面对他。"放开我，你这个白痴，不然我踢你到——"

"Asuka listen for just a sec-"  
"明日香，听我说一会儿就好——"

"No I wont ass-hole!" "不，我不会的，混蛋！"

"Asuka, Ayanami's like me, she's-"  
"明日香，绫波和我一样，她是——"

"You already told me that you moron!"  
"你已经告诉我了，你这个白痴！"

"No...I mean-" "不...我是说-"

Asuka yanked her hand out of Shinji's grasp and took several steps away from him. Rubbing her wrist slightly she glanced back at Shinji who was staring down at the sidewalk and thought, 'God...when did he get so strong?'  
明日香猛地从真嗣手中抽出手，向后退了几步。她轻轻揉着手腕，瞥了一眼低头盯着人行道的真嗣，心想，'天啊...他什么时候变得这么强了？'

"So what _did_ you mean then?" asked Asuka, her voice filled with spite.  
"那你到底是什么意思？" 明日香问道，语气中充满了怨恨。

Shinji looked away from the sidewalk and back at Asuka with a glum look on his face. Running a hand through his hair, he looked as though he was preparing himself for something. Asuka was so shocked at the sudden change in his demeanor that she was about say she was sorry, when Shinji brought his right hand up and seemed to place it over an invisible wall to the right of him. Asuka's mouth opened with a gasp as a brief flash of orange light lit up the sidewalk they were standing on. As her vision returned to her though, she saw that an orange like triangle seemed to be frozen in midair directly where Shinji's hand was placed palm outwards.  
真嗣从人行道上移开视线，回头看向明日香，脸上带着忧郁的表情。他用手梳理着头发，看起来像是在准备着什么。明日香对真嗣突然改变的态度感到震惊，正想说声对不起，这时真嗣举起右手，似乎放在他右侧的一堵无形墙壁上。明日香倒吸一口凉气，一道短暂的橙色光芒照亮了他们站立的人行道。然而，当她的视线恢复时，她看到一个橙色的三角形似乎悬浮在空中，就在真嗣手掌平放的位置。

"Shin-" "真-

"I don't know for certain," he replied quietly, cutting her off, "but I think she can create an AT-field also. Me, Ayanami, and Kaoru. We're all linked in someway...I just don't know how."  
“我不确定，”他轻声回答，打断了她，“但我认为她也能创造 AT 力场。我、绫波和薰，我们之间有某种联系……我只是不知道具体是什么。”

As Shinji turned towards her, Asuka couldn't help but feel a little afraid as his blood red eyes stared back at her.  
当真嗣转向她时，明日香不禁感到有些害怕，因为他的血红色眼睛回望着她。

"This is only your second time seeing me like this," Shinji said, "so I can understand if you're afraid. Last time you saw me like this I killed someone."  
"这仅仅是第二次你看到我这个样子，" 真嗣说道，"所以如果你感到害怕，我能理解。上次你看到我这样时，我杀了人。"

"Shinji...you shouldn't," she attempted.  
"真嗣...你不应该这样，" 她试图劝说。"

"If Nerv agents are watching right now...I don't care. Its progressed though...the eyes only used to change sometimes, and they only ever flashed a brief scarlet. After the previous angel battle though, I think my angel half started to gain more control. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, only to find that my eyes have changed colors."  
"如果 NERV 的特工现在正在监视...我不在乎。但情况确实在发展...眼睛过去只是偶尔会变，而且只会短暂地闪现猩红色。但在上一次与使徒的战斗后，我觉得我的使徒部分开始获得更多控制权。有时我半夜醒来，发现我的眼睛已经改变了颜色。"

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Do you...feel different."  
"你...感觉有什么不同吗？"

Shinji took a few seconds to reply before he said, "A little I suppose. My body temperature seems to be warmer when I'm like this. And my senses are certainly heightened, but I think the same and feel the same."  
真嗣顿了几秒才回答道：“我想是有一点吧。变成这样时，我的体温似乎会升高。而且我的感官确实变得更加敏锐，但我还是我，想法和感觉都没变。”

"Can I...I mean..." "我能...我是说..."

"What?" asked Shinji rather skeptical, but Asuka was already taking several tenuous steps towards him, still feelings unsure of herself. Though as she got directly in front of him, her head tilted up to see him, and Shinji had to look away.  
"什么？" 真嗣带着几分怀疑问道，但明日香已经小心翼翼地向他迈出了几步，内心仍感到不确定。尽管当她直接站在他面前，抬头望向他时，真嗣不得不移开了视线。

"I should dissipate the AT-filed," he said hurriedly, "My eyes should revert to their normal color shortly after."  
"我应该解除 AT 力场，" 他急忙说道，"我的眼睛应该很快就会恢复正常的颜色。"

"One-second," said Asuka as she slowly reached a hand up and placed it against Shinji's cheek, making him flinch.  
"等一下，" 明日香说着，缓缓地伸出手，放在真嗣的脸颊上，让他不由得一颤。

"Asuka...what are you-" But she completely ignored him, continuing to stroke his cheek with her hand.  
"明日香...你在干什么-" 但她完全无视了他，继续用手抚摸他的脸颊。

"I shouldn't have shown you this," he finally said. "I told myself that I wouldn't let you be anymore involved with Nerv and everything else than you already are."  
"我不该给你看这个，" 他终于说道。"我告诉过自己，不会再让你卷入 Nerv 和所有其他事情中，超过你已经参与的程度。"

"A bit late for that," replied Asuka softly. "In fact, I think it was a bit late the moment a met you."  
"现在说这个有点晚了，" 明日香轻声回答。"事实上，我觉得从遇见你的那一刻起，就已经晚了。"

"Well...maybe," said Shinji slightly sheepish. "We should stop this though...who knows when someone will come around the corner," he said while gesturing behind them at the corner they had rounded earlier.  
"嗯...也许吧，" 真嗣略带尴尬地说，"不过我们还是应该停下来...谁知道什么时候会有人从拐角那边过来，" 他一边说一边指着他们之前转过的那个角落。

"Right," said Asuka, taking a step away from him.  
"对，" 明日香说着，向后退了一步。

Shinji then lowered his right hand and dissipated the AT-field, and shortly after, his eyes turned back to the normal brown.  
随后，真嗣放下了右手，解除了 AT 力场，不久后，他的眼睛也恢复了正常的棕色。

"Why do you care for her all the sudden?" asked Asuka suddenly.  
"为什么你突然关心起她来了？" 明日香突然问道。

"Who?" "谁？"

"The pet...Rei, I mean." "那个宠物...我是说绫。"

Shinji was rather surprised that she had called Rei by her name. He had never heard her call Rei anything other than 'the pet.'  
真嗣颇为惊讶她竟然直呼了绫波的名字。他从未听过她用其他称呼叫绫波，除了‘那只宠物’。

"Because...she's alone like I was, and I don't want anybody else to have to feel that."  
“因为……她像我以前那样孤独，我不想再有人感受到那种感觉。”

"Did you ever think how I felt about that? That you're suddenly talking to her...I mean...how I feel about you...and-"  
“你有没有想过我对此的感受？你突然和她说话……我是说……我对你的感觉……还有——”

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "Its not like that, and it never will be Asuka. You know how I feel about you as well..."  
"摇了摇头，真嗣说道：“不是那样的，而且永远不会是，明日香。你也知道我对你的感觉……””

They had rarely talked about their feelings for each other, and suddenly because of Asuka's jealousy it came bubbling to the surface.  
他们很少谈及彼此的感情，但突然间因为明日香的嫉妒，这些情感一下子涌了出来。

"This isn't something we should talk about...especially right here," said Shinji finally  
“这不是我们应该谈论的事情……尤其是现在这里，”真嗣终于说道

Asuka continued gazing at him for a moment, looking rather forlorn until she said, "We should probably get back to the apartment."  
明日香继续凝视了他一会儿，显得有些落寞，直到她说：“我们或许应该回公寓了。”

"Yeah...probably," replied Shinji, suddenly feeling like taking a stroll around Tokyo-3 with Asuka. Though as they started taking a few steps forward, Asuka's cell phone rang. Fishing it out of one of her pockets, she flipped it open, listened to the person on the other end for a few seconds and closed it with a snap.  
“嗯……大概吧，”真嗣回答道，突然有种想和明日香在第三新东京市散步的冲动。然而，当他们开始向前走了几步时，明日香的手机响了。她从口袋里掏出手机，翻开盖子，听了对方几秒钟的话，然后啪的一声合上了手机。

"Whats up?" asked Shinji, knowing to well what the response would be.  
“怎么了？”真嗣问道，心里清楚对方的回答会是什么。

Frowning down at her cell phone, Asuka said, "That was Misato. It seems the next angel has been detected just outside the earths atmosphere."  
皱着眉头盯着手机，明日香说道：“那是美里。似乎下一个使徒已经在地球大气层外被探测到了。”

"...What?" "...什么？"

"I know...I don't see how we destroy it if its all the way up there."  
“我知道……我不明白如果我们离它那么远，怎么才能摧毁它。”

"Well...lets not keep her waiting at least."  
“好吧……至少我们别让她等太久。”

"...Yeah..." "……嗯……"

---

"Any idea on how we're supposed to destroy that thing yet?" asked Shinji.  
“我们到底该怎么摧毁那东西，有什么想法吗？”真嗣问道。

Him and Asuka were already dressed down in there plug suits, and waiting on standby for the go ahead to attack the angel. So far though, no such order had come. The original plan was to attack the angel with the positron rifle used against Ramiel, but that plan was scraped, since somebody had to open a hole in the angels AT-field first.  
他和明日香已经穿上了插入栓服，随时待命准备攻击使徒。但到目前为止，还没有下达这样的命令。最初的计划是使用对付雷米尔时的阳电子炮攻击使徒，但这个计划被放弃了，因为首先需要有人打开使徒的 AT 力场。

"No, we haven't," said Fuyutsuki, who was surprisingly in charge of the operation this time. Misato stood behind him, looking rather annoyed that her position had been briefly usurped.  
“没有，我们还没想出来，”这次出人意料地由冬月负责指挥。美里站在他身后，看起来对她的职位暂时被取代感到相当不悦。

"We should have visual in a minute or so; the satellite should be making a pass soon."  
"我们大概一分钟左右就能看到图像了；卫星应该很快就会经过这里。"

'Just as long as it doesn't destroy the satellite first,' thought Misato.  
'只要它别先把卫星毁了就行，' 美里心想。

"What about Ayanami?" asked Shinji as he looked around the command center. "Shouldn't she be here?"  
"绫波呢？" 真嗣环顾指挥中心问道。"她不应该在这里吗？"

"Rei arrived earlier," said Misato, but she wouldn't add where she was or what she was doing.  
“丽来得更早，”美里说，但她没有透露自己在哪里或做了什么。

Asuka clicked her tongue loudly, clearly annoyed that Shinji had even brought up her name, when the subject of their earlier argument on been largely based on her.  
明日香大声咂舌，显然对真嗣提到她的名字感到恼火，尽管他们早先争论的主题很大程度上是围绕她的。

"Visual confirmation coming on in...three..two..one. Pattern blue confirmed, no changes in energy read out...AT-field still up."  
“视觉确认即将开始……三……二……一。蓝色模式确认，能量读数无变化……AT 力场依然存在。”

Shinji and Asuka turned towards the large screen to there left and looked at the giant object floating seamlessly in space. The entire body of the angel was purely white, while several forks that looked similar to tree branches jutted outward of the main body.  
真嗣和明日香转向左侧的大屏幕，注视着那个在太空中无瑕漂浮的巨大物体。天使的整个身体纯白无瑕，几根形似树枝的分叉从主体向外伸展。

"Everything is the same as it was when it first appeared, and we're not sure what its objective seems to be. But in the mean time we want you two to wait for orders to deploy. Rei should be with you shortly."  
“一切与它初次出现时相同，我们尚不确定其目的为何。但目前我们希望你们两人待命，等待部署指令。绫波应该很快就会与你们会合。”

"Fine then, lets go Shinji," Asuka said as she linked her arm around his and started dragging him towards the elevator where it would take them to the Eva chambers.  
“好吧，那我们走吧，真嗣，”明日香说着，挽住他的手臂，拉着他向电梯走去，电梯将带他们前往 EVA 驾驶舱。

"Hold on," said Fuyutsuki quickly. "Unit 01 is to remain in the chamber unless different orders come down from the commander."  
"等等，" 冬月迅速说道，"除非指挥官有其他命令，否则 01 号机必须留在舱室内。"

Spinning around and taking Asuka with him, Shinji retorted angrily, "What! Why am I not deploying!"  
转身带着明日香一起，真嗣愤怒地反驳道："什么！为什么我不去出击！"

"Because after the last angel battle Unit 01 absorbed the S2 engine and we don't know what adverse effects it may have on the unit or you."  
"因为在与上一个使徒的战斗中，01 号机吸收了 S2 引擎，我们还不清楚这会对机体或你产生什么不良影响。"

"Bullshit! I'm not letting Asuka and Ayanami fighting the angel alone. Get my father on a separate line and I'll-"  
"胡说八道！我不会让明日香和绫波独自对抗使徒的。给我父亲单独接通一条线，我会——"

"Its your father, the commander, who expressly told me that under no circumstances were you allowed to participate in this battle. We have no idea what this new angel is capable of, and after that last we aren't taking any chances."  
"是你父亲，指挥官，明确告诉我，在任何情况下你都不允许参与这场战斗。我们对这个新使徒的能力一无所知，经过上次的事件，我们不会冒任何风险。"

"So Asuka and Ayanami are just throw away lab rats!" Shinji roared. "And that you send me in after the angel is done with them!"  
"所以明日香和绫波只是可以随意抛弃的实验小白鼠！"" 真嗣咆哮道，""而你们打算等使徒对付完她们之后再派我上！"

"You have to realize the position you're in Shinji-kun. You're unique and have the most raw potential as an Evangelion pilot...and I'm not talking synchronization tests."  
"你得明白你现在的处境，真嗣君。你是独一无二的，拥有作为 EVA 驾驶员最原始的潜力...我说的可不是同步测试。"

"I don't care about that! What I care about is you using Asu-"  
"我不在乎那些！我在乎的是你利用明日香——"

"Don't make me confine you," said Fuyutsuki with a sigh. "I don't want to resort to something like that."  
"别逼我限制你，" 副司令叹息道，"我不想走到那一步。"

"Why? Because then you'll be just like my father?"  
“为什么？因为那样你就会变得和我父亲一样？”

Fuyutsuki continued staring at him until Shinji turned away and said, "Do what you want, and I'll do what I want. But remember that I wont hesitate to rip apart this facility if I think Asuka is in trouble. And that goes for Ayanami also," he added as an afterthought.  
冬月继续盯着他，直到真嗣转过头去，说道：“你想做什么就做什么，我会做我想做的。但记住，如果我认为明日香有麻烦，我会毫不犹豫地摧毁这个设施。还有，绫波也一样，”他补充道，作为事后考虑。

Without another word, he walked towards the elevator, slammed the down button, and disappeared.  
没有再说一句话，他走向电梯，猛按下楼按钮，然后消失了。

Misato and Asuka continued looking at the elevator where he vanished while Fuyutsuki returned to the monitor and said without looking at Asuka, "Unit 00 will provide long range back up for Unit 02 if necessary. This is simply surveillance of the angel to see if it reacts to the Evangelions at all."  
美里和明日香继续盯着他消失的电梯，而冬月则回到监视器前，没有看向明日香，说道：“如果需要，零号机会为二号机提供远程支援。这只是对使徒的监视，看看它是否会对 EVA 有所反应。”

"And what happens if it does?" asked Misato quietly.  
“那如果它有反应呢？”美里轻声问道。

"Then we'll think of something," replied Fuyutsuki. Though in truth, a plan had already been decided upon, even if he didn't agree with it...  
“那我们再想办法，”冬月回答道。尽管事实上，一个计划已经决定，即使他并不赞同……

---

Eventually Units 00 and 02 were given the order to deploy while Shinji was left behind inside Unit 01, the freeze still in effect. When Asuka had come down the elevator, she had attempted to talk to Shinji, but he wouldn't listen. He brushed her off saying that he didn't want to talk with her right now. Asuka, however, felt as though an invisible wall had come between them.  
最终，零号机和二号机接到了出击命令，而真嗣则被留在了一号机内，冻结状态依旧。当明日香乘电梯下来时，她试图与真嗣交谈，但他不予理睬。他推开她说现在不想和她说话。然而，明日香感觉他们之间仿佛竖起了一堵无形的墙。

Now though she had to attempt to clear her mind of everything related to Shinji, which was proving difficult, since he had recently been occupying most of her thoughts.  
现在，她必须努力清除与真嗣有关的一切思绪，这相当困难，因为他最近占据了她的绝大部分心思。

'Damn it,' she thought, slightly annoyed as she made Unit 02 crouch behind a nearby building, looking up at the small ball of light that was the angel. 'When the hell did I get so sappy?' she wondered.  
“该死，”她想着，略感烦躁地让二号机蹲在一栋建筑后面，抬头望着那团微小的光球——天使。“我什么时候变得这么多愁善感了？”她纳闷道。

She didn't have time to reflect on her feelings though as Fuyutsuki ordered her to move closer to the target.  
然而，她没有时间去反思自己的感受，因为冬月命令她向目标靠近。

Asuka then moved Unit 02 out from behind the building that she was currently crouched behind and started counting down the range to the target. After she reached five, she paused and ducked behind another building, wiping some sweat off her brow in the process.  
随后，明日香操控二号机从她目前藏身的建筑物后移动出来，开始倒数与目标的距离。到达五米时，她停下并躲到另一栋建筑后，顺便擦了擦额头的汗水。

'Damn...I'm gonna need a shower after this,' she thought silently.  
“该死……这之后我得洗个澡，”她默默地想。

"No change in the target," she said. "...Pe-I mean Rei, how does it look from back there?"  
"目标没有变化，"她说道。"...碇-我是说丽，从后面看起来怎么样？"

"No change in the target," she said repeating Asuka's words.  
"目标没有变化，"她重复着明日香的话。

Asuka frowned slightly at Rei's mimicry of her words and looked back at the target.  
明日香对丽的模仿微微皱眉，回头看向目标。

'Just a little more,' she thought.  
"'就差一点了,' 她心想。

Rei meanwhile was many meters behind Asuka, providing cover with the positron rifle. While it was nowhere near powerful enough to destroy the angel while it stayed in space, the theory was that the angel would have to bring down its AT-field in order to attack. Therefore, Rei was providing substantial cover fire in case anything happened.  
"与此同时，绫波丽落后于明日香许多米，用阳电子步枪提供掩护。虽然这把枪的威力远不足以在使徒停留在太空时将其摧毁，但理论上是使徒为了攻击必须降低 AT 力场。因此，绫波丽在必要时提供大量掩护火力。

Taking a deep breath, Asuka said, "Heading towards final point, energy readouts still nominal, no change in the target."  
深吸一口气，明日香说道："前往最终点，能量读数仍正常，目标无变化。"

"Proceed then," said Fuyutsuki.  
"那就继续吧，" 副司令福音津说道。

Keeping low to the ground, Unit 02 ran the rest of the distance before it stood directly underneath the angel.  
二号机贴地而行，迅速穿越剩余的距离，最终直接站在了使徒的正下方。

"Target point reached," said Asuka letting out a low sigh. "No changes...it doesn't even seem to know I'm here."  
"到达目标点，" 明日香轻叹一声，"没有任何变化...它甚至似乎没有察觉到我的存在。"

"Dr. Akagi?" asked Fuyutsuki back in the command center.  
"赤木博士？" 在指挥中心，冬月问道。

"Unknown why the angel isn't attacking," replied Ritsuko. "Perhaps it has something to do with Unit 01 and Shinji not being here. If you remember, the previous angel seemed to react when it saw Unit 01 and Shinji."  
"不清楚为何使徒没有发动攻击，" 律子回答，"或许这与零号机和真嗣不在这里有关。你记得吗，之前的使徒似乎在看到零号机和真嗣时有所反应。"

"Even so, we can't send Unit 01 out. Its too much of a risk."  
"即便如此，我们也不能派出零号机。风险太大了。"

"Then I suggest we have Units 00 and 02 retreat for the time being...unless you have any other ideas."  
"那么我建议我们先让 00 和 02 号机暂时撤退...除非你有其他想法。"

"For the time being, I don't. Unit 02 will retreat to the eleventh defensive line while Unit 00 will provide cover if necessary."  
"目前我没有什么其他计划。02 号机将撤退到第十一道防线，而 00 号机将在必要时提供掩护。"

'Tch,' thought Asuka as she heard the orders. 'What the hell was even the point of this operation?' Though as she made Unit 02 turn around, the angel struck.  
“啧，”明日香听到命令时心想，“这次行动到底有什么意义？”尽管她操控 02 号机转身时，使徒发动了攻击。

"Sudden spike in energy readout."  
"能量读数突然飙升。"

"What?" asked Fuyutsuki. "什么？" 冬月问道。"

A multicolored beam suddenly shot from the white branches surrounding the angel and shrouded Unit 02.  
一道五彩斑斓的光束突然从天使周围的白色枝条中射出，笼罩了二号机。

"What is this!" asked Fuyutsuki quickly.  
"这是什么！" 冬月迅速问道。

"The computer can't read the energy pattern, but it bears certain similarities to an angels AT-field. It seems as though the AT-field has been reversed, creating an inverse wavelength."  
"计算机无法识别这种能量模式，但它与天使的 AT 力场有某些相似之处。似乎 AT 力场被反转了，产生了反向波长。"

"Fluctuation in the pilots mental graph, synchronization down twenty percent, heart beat irregular."  
"驾驶员精神图谱波动，同步率下降百分之二十，心率不规则。"

Ritsuko then looked at Asuka's brain waves and said, "Is the angel trying to examine the human mind?"  
律子随后观察了明日香的脑波，说道：“天使是在试图窥探人类的心灵吗？”

"Asuka get out of there!" yelled Misato suddenly, bypassing Fuyutsuki's orders.  
“明日香，快离开那里！”美里突然大喊，无视了冬月的命令。

"No! I can still fight!"  
“不！我还能战斗！”

"This is an order retrea-"  
"这是撤退命令——"

Before she could finish however, Fuyutsuki cut her off and gave orders to Rei.  
然而，她还没说完，冬月就打断了她，并向绫波下达了指令。

"Unit 00 prepare to fire positron rifle upon target. Correct for distance...minus eight degrees."  
"零号机准备发射阳电子步枪，目标锁定，距离修正……减八度。"

"Understood," she said as she quickly adjusted her aim and pulled the trigger.  
“明白，”她迅速调整瞄准，扣动了扳机。

Almost like a bolt of blue lightning, the positron rifle discharged and fired at the angels, piercing the stratosphere of the planet. The beam rocketed toward the angel, flying straight through the seemingly transparent colored beam. Though as the beam reached the angel, it was met by an invisible wall, and suddenly it split, ricochetting to the left and right of the angel.  
宛如一道蓝色闪电，阳电子步枪发射，向天使们射去，穿透了行星的平流层。光束直奔天使，径直穿过看似透明的彩色光束。然而，当光束触及天使时，却遭遇了一堵无形之墙，随即分裂，向天使左右两侧弹射开来。

"The angels AT-field is still up. There's not enough energy to break through it."  
“天使的 AT 力场依然存在。能量不足，无法突破。”

'Damn,' thought Fuyutsuki silently.  
“该死，”冬月默默地想。

"Heart beat of the pilot of 02 is still raising."  
“02 号驾驶员的心跳仍在上升。”

"Transfer all available power to life-support systems," said Ritsuko hurriedly.  
“将所有可用电力转移到生命维持系统，”律子急忙说道。

"And have Rei get Asuka out of there!" yelled Misato, ignoring the fact that she wasn't in charge of this operation.  
"让丽把明日香带出来！" 美里大喊道，全然不顾自己并非此次行动的指挥官。

"No!" Asuka suddenly screamed back. "I don't want her rescuing me! Anything but her! I'd rather die than have her protecting me!"  
"不！" 明日香突然尖叫着回应。"我不要她救我！除了她谁都行！我宁愿死也不要她保护我！"

"Asuk-" "明日香-"

"DON'T LOOK AT ME!" she suddenly screeched. "DON'T LOOK INSIDE MY MIND!"  
"别看我！" 她突然尖叫起来。"别窥探我的内心！"

"Mental contamination setting in."  
"精神污染正在加剧。"

"Forcefully eject the entry plug, get her out of there," yelled Misato.  
"强行弹出插入栓，把她弄出来，" 美里喊道。"

"Unit 02 doesn't recognize the signature. The pilot has locked it from the inside."  
"初号机无法识别该信号。驾驶员从内部将其锁定了。"

"Heart beat continuing to rise. Vice Commander," said Ritsuko suddenly. "If this continues, the increase in the pilots blood pressure will kill her."  
"心跳持续上升，副司令，"" 赤木律子突然说道，""如果这种情况持续下去，驾驶员的血压升高会危及她的生命。"

"I know but-" "我知道，但是——"

"Kozo," said a voice suddenly behind everybody.  
"高雄," 一个声音突然在众人身后响起。

As everybody turned around, they saw that Gendo Ikari, the commander, had come to overlook the operation.  
当大家转过身来，他们看到源堂·碇，指挥官，已经前来视察行动。

"Have Rei retrieve the Lance of Longinus."  
"让绫波取出朗基努斯之枪。"

Fuyutsuki blinked once to show his surprise and asked oblivious to everybody else in the room, "Isn't it to early to use it?"  
冬月眨了一下眼表示惊讶，无视房间里的其他人问道：“现在就用它，是不是太早了？”

"The only way to defeat an enemy from outside our atmosphere is to use the Lance of Longinus. Have Rei descend to Central Dogma and retrieve it."  
“要击败外层空间的敌人，唯一的方法就是使用朗基努斯之枪。让绫波前往中央教条区取回它。”

This was what Fuyutsuki had feared ever since he heard the angel was outside the atmosphere. The Lance of Longinus, that which Saint Longinus pierced the side of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, was capable of piercing an angels AT-field.  
自从得知天使位于外层空间以来，冬月就一直担心这一点。朗基努斯之枪，即圣朗基努斯用来刺穿拿撒勒人耶稣、上帝之子侧身的那把枪，能够穿透天使的 AT 力场。

"Very well...and what about Unit 02?"  
"很好……那二号机呢？"

Gendo stood still for a second before he beckoned for Fuyutsuki to follow him towards the chair that he normally sat in while overseeing any of the battles.  
碇源堂静立片刻，随后示意冬月耕造跟随他走向那把他在监督任何战斗时通常坐的椅子。

"Unit 02 still has its uses to us."  
"二号机对我们仍有其用处。"

"And what about the pilot."  
"那飞行员呢？"

"Have Dr. Akagi prepare a replacement if need be."  
"如果需要的话，让赤木博士准备一个替代者。"

"Very well," said Fuyutsuki standing to his rightful height. Turning towards the monitor, he said, "Give all priority to retrieving the Lance of Longinus. When the angel is destroyed, start the decontamination of Unit 02 and its pilot."  
"很好，"" 副司令富津崎站起身，恢复了他应有的威严。转向监控屏幕，他说道，""优先任务是回收朗基努斯之枪。当使徒被消灭后，立即开始对二号机及其驾驶员进行净化处理。"

"Uh...sir, I have the pilot of Unit 01 on line three."  
“呃...先生，我在三号线接通了 01 号机驾驶员。”

Fuyutsuki let out a sigh, he knew that this conversation would have to happen eventually, but he didn't like it anymore so. However, it looked as though he had a way out since Gendo said, "I'll receive the communication. Switch the audio control over to me."  
冬月叹了口气，他知道这场对话迟早要进行，但他已经不再喜欢这样了。然而，看起来他有个脱身之计，因为碇源堂说：“我来接听通讯。把音频控制转给我。”

Nodding her head, the operative differed all audio over to Gendo.  
操作员点了点头，将所有音频转接给了碇源堂。

"This is the commander..."  
"这位是指挥官……"

Shinji who had not realized what was going on until just recently was rather surprised to hear his supposed father talking to him. Though as Asuka's scream replayed in his head, he said with as much strength as he could muster, "I'm deploying with Unit 01 and helping her."  
直到最近才意识到发生了什么的真嗣，听到他所谓的父亲对他说话感到相当惊讶。尽管明日香的尖叫声在他脑海中回响，他还是尽可能坚定地说：“我将驾驶初号机出击，帮助她。”

"And how do you suppose you'll do that? The angel cannot be destroyed in any way you understand."  
"你打算怎么做？以你所理解的方式，天使是无法被摧毁的。"

"Even so...Asuka is-" "即便如此...明日香她——"

"We cannot risk the chance of putting Unit 01 in danger."  
"我们不能冒险让零一号机陷入危险。"

"So you're just going abandon her!"  
"所以你就打算抛弃她！"

"I did not say that. Rei is retrieving the Lance of Longinus as we speak, but until then we can't do anything for her."  
"我没有那么说。丽正在取朗基努斯之枪，但在此之前我们无法为她做任何事。"

"Thats just how you feel! I'll go there if I have to with my own two legs!" yelled Shinji.  
"那只是你的感觉！如果必须的话，我会亲自用我的两条腿去那里！" 真嗣喊道。"

"In which case I shall have you confined to quarters."  
"那样的话，我会将你禁足。"

"I'll just break out!" "我这就冲出去！"

"Sever all communication with the pilot of Unit 01 and forcefully eject the entry plug from Unit 01."  
"切断与 01 机驾驶员的所有通讯，并强行弹出 01 机的插入栓。"

"You fucking bast-" "你这个混蛋——"

Shinji last words were cut off however as the communication was severed.  
然而，真嗣的最后一句话被切断了，因为通讯中断了。

"Status of Unit 00?" asked Gendo  
“零号机的状态？”碇源堂问道

"Passing levels fifteen through twenty now. Continuing descent."  
“当前通过十五至二十级。继续下降。”

"Prep elevator shaft number nine for the return of Unit 00."  
"准备第九号电梯井，迎接零号机回归。"

"Yes sir." "是，长官。"

---

"Who are you?" "你是谁？"

"I'm you." "我就是你。"

"No your not!" "不，你不是！"

"I'm the you that you sealed away."  
"我是你封印的那个你。"

"No thats not me!" "不，那不是我！"

"Then who are you?" "那你又是谁？"

"Wha-" "什-"

"If I'm not you...then who are you?"  
"如果我不是你...那么你是谁？"

Asuka's mind had been violated. Everything she had ever experienced, good and bad, had been laid bare for the angel to see. It felt as though she was in an open room, completely naked, while hundreds upon thousands of people stared at her, examining every aspect of her being.  
明日香的心灵受到了侵犯。她所经历的一切，无论是好是坏，都被天使一览无余。她感觉自己仿佛置身于一个空旷的房间，赤裸裸地暴露在成千上万人的目光下，他们审视着她的每一个方面。

"No! Thats not who I am! I'm different!"  
"不！那不是我！我是不同的！"

"Why do you believe you're different?"  
"你为何相信自己与众不同？"

"Because I have to! I can't be them!"  
"因为我必须如此！我不能成为他们！"

"Who is them?" "他们是谁？"

"Everybody! I hate them!"  
"大家！我讨厌他们！"

"Why do you hate them?"  
"你为什么讨厌他们？"

"Because they don't acknowledge me!"  
"因为他们不承认我！"

Suddenly she saw flashes of her hateful childhood. Her father coming home drunk, and whipping her with his belt. All alone at middle school, because people thought she was a freak with her shabby clothes and strange colored her. At college, where she shinned above everybody else, but was shunned because of that same shine.  
突然间，她脑海中闪现出那些令人憎恶的童年片段。父亲醉醺醺地回家，用皮带抽打她。中学时孤零零一人，因为同学们认为她是个穿着破旧、头发颜色怪异的怪胎。到了大学，她才华横溢，光芒四射，却也因此遭到排斥。

"I don't need them! I'm fine being alone!"  
“我不需要他们！我一个人挺好的！”

"Liar..." “骗子……”

She stood by herself in a pitch blackness, with nobody around like she wanted it. But somebody else was there with her. Suddenly a spotlight shinned down from above and bathed her in light. While another spotlight did the same to the Asuka standing next to her.  
她独自站在漆黑一片中，周围空无一人，正如她所愿。但有另一个人与她同在。突然，一束聚光灯从上方照射下来，将她笼罩在光芒之中。与此同时，另一束聚光灯也同样照亮了站在她身边的明日香。

"What is this?" she asked.  
“这是什么？”她问道。

"This is you, with everything you've ever thought out in the open."  
“这就是你，把你所有曾经思考过的一切都摊开在阳光下。”

"No! Don't look at me like that."  
"不！别那样看我。"

"Then how do you want me to look at you?"  
"那你想让我怎么看你？"

Another Asuka suddenly appeared before her, one that was grossly different than how she herself looked. This Asuka's hair was incredibly short, like how Rei kept hers. But it was how she acted that was different. The personality was too upbeat, similar to how Hikari acted sometimes.  
另一个明日香突然出现在她面前，与她自己截然不同。这个明日香的头发非常短，就像绫波留的那样。但她的行为举止更为不同。她的性格过于开朗，有时像光那样。

"I'm Asuka Soryu." "我是惣流·明日香。"

"No, thats not me!" Asuka yelled, shattering the different personality.  
"不，那不是我！" 明日香大喊，打破了不同的人格。

"Then is this you?" "那么，这才是你吗？"

The Asuka that appeared before her now had much longer hair that reached to the waist. However her demeanor was much different. She was wearing white high heels with a blue skirt and matching white blouse. In her hand she held a cigarette.  
出现在她面前的这个明日香，头发比以往更长，直达腰际。然而她的举止却大相径庭。她穿着白色高跟鞋，搭配蓝色短裙和相衬的白色衬衫。手中还夹着一支香烟。

"No! Thats not me either!"  
“不！那也不是我！”

"How are you different then the others? Aren't you just like them?"  
“那你和她们有什么不同？你不也和她们一样吗？”

"No! I can't be just like them! I refuse."  
"不！我不能变得像他们一样！我拒绝。"

Suddenly Asuka was assault with a flood of memories so strong that it made her choke momentarily. She watched as she got off a Nerv plane and took her first step in Tokyo-3. Meeting Misato and shortly after, finding out that she would be living with the stupidest guy on the planet. Her normal interactions with Shinji, day in and day out. There experiences together, both as pilots and confused teenagers. The rape, and subsequent reveal of his abnormal self. The date and everything that had transpired that day.  
突然间，阿斯卡被一股强烈的记忆洪流冲击，让她一时哽咽。她看着自己走下 NERV 的飞机，在第三新东京市迈出第一步。遇见美里，不久后发现她将和这个星球上最蠢的家伙同住。她与真嗣的日常互动，日复一日。作为驾驶员和困惑的青少年，他们共同经历的一切。强奸，以及随后他异常自我的揭露。那次约会以及那天发生的所有事情。

"This is you. These are the memories that make up the person who is Asuka Soryu."  
"这就是你。这些记忆构成了阿斯卡·索尤这个人的全部。"

Everything with Shinji, everything she had ever thought of him. Every word she had ever called him. Every feel of his skin, every touch of his hair, every beat of her heart when around him, and every unique emotion she had always felt while with him-  
关于真嗣的一切，她曾经对他所有的想法。她曾经对他说的每一个词。每一次触碰他的肌肤，每一次抚摸他的头发，每一次在他身边时心跳的每一拍，以及每一次与他在一起时所感受到的独特情感——

'Ah...this is me, and everything with Shinji is also me. ...I just wish I would have told him how I felt sooner...'  
'啊...这就是我，与真嗣有关的一切也是我。...我只希望我能早点告诉他我的感受...'

-Suddenly broke and shattered around her.  
——突然间在她周围破碎了。

---

"Change in pilots mental graph...there's...nothing?"  
"驾驶员精神图谱的变化...这里...什么都没有？"

"What?" asked Ritsuko as she spun around in the direction of the operative.  
""什么？"" 律子问道，随即转向操作员的方向。

"Pulse suddenly dropped, and heart rate suddenly slowed to normal."  
"脉搏突然下降，心率骤然恢复正常。"

"What happened? Did the angel stop?"  
"发生了什么？天使停止了吗？"

"No pattern blue is still...wait...pattern blue detected...inside the entry plug of Unit 02."  
"没有，蓝色模式仍然在……等等……检测到蓝色模式……在二号机的插入栓内。"

"Where did it originate?"  
"它起源于哪里？"

"Thats the problem...it originated inside Unit 02."  
“问题就在这里……它起源于二号机内部。”

"What?" "什么？"

"Pilot life signs continuing to drop, life support systems forcefully stopping."  
“驾驶员生命迹象持续下降，生命维持系统被迫停止。”

"Damn it! How soon will Rei reach the surface!"  
“该死！绫波还要多久才能到达地面！”

"She just retrieved the lance and is now proceeding up elevator shaft number nine."  
"她刚刚取回长矛，现在正向九号电梯井前进。"

"Isolate that signal inside the entry plug of Unit 02. We have to keep her alive!"  
"将那个信号隔离在二号机插入栓内。我们必须保证她活着！"

"Computers have not found the signal...wait...it suddenly disappeared?"  
"电脑尚未找到信号……等等……它突然消失了？"

"Wha-" "什-"

"Pilot heart rate plummeting! Brain waves ceasing...reaching a comatose like state."  
"驾驶员心率骤降！脑电波停止...进入类似昏迷状态。"

"Revert power to nerve impulses two hundred and eleven through two hundred forty-four. Keep her heart beating damn it!"  
"将能量恢复至神经冲动第二百一十一至第二百四十四。保持她的心跳，该死！"

Misato watched helpless as everything seemed to be falling apart. Even Ritsuko was starting to lose it. If Asuka died...then she would be partially responsible. And what about Shinji?  
美里无助地看着一切似乎都在崩溃。就连律子也开始失去冷静。如果明日香死了...那么她将负有部分责任。还有真嗣呢？

"Shock seems to have no effect."  
"冲击似乎没有效果。"

"Then increase the nerve impulses damn it!" yelled Ritsuko.  
"那就增加神经脉冲，该死的！" 律子喊道。"

"Pilot mental graph still showing nothing. Possibility of mental contamination high."  
"驾驶员心理图谱仍无反应。精神污染的可能性很高。"

"Increase the LCL fluid to the limit," said Gendo suddenly speaking up.  
“将 LCL 液量增加到极限，”碇司令突然开口说道。

Surprised that he would suggest such a thing, Ritsuko turned towards him and asked, "But wont that-"  
对于他会提出这样的建议感到惊讶，律子转向他问道：“但那样不会——”

"If the LCL fluid is increased to the limit, the connection between the pilot and Unit 02 should cease. After such we can take control of Unit 02 and eject the entry plug that the pilot locked from the inside."  
“如果将 LCL 液量增加到极限，驾驶员与二号机之间的连接应该会中断。之后我们就可以控制二号机，并弹出驾驶员从内部锁死的插入栓。”

"But the resounding pressure on her weakened heart could kill her."  
“但那股对脆弱心脏的沉重压迫可能会要了她的命。”

"Bring the concentration of LCL fluid up to 16.7%, it wont be enough to kill a human being, but it should be enough to knock the pilot out. And raise areas thirteen through twenty of the down Tokyo-3 area. Rei will need some room for the lance to have a desired effect."  
“将 LCL 液体的浓度提升至 16.7%，这不足以杀死一个人，但足以让驾驶员昏迷。同时提升东京-3 地区下方的十三至二十区。绫波需要足够的空间让长枪发挥预期效果。”

Ritsuko scrutinized him for a moment, but realized that time was of the essence.  
律子仔细打量了他一会儿，但意识到时间紧迫。

"Do as he says," she replied to the operational room.  
“照他说的做，”她对操作室回复道。

Unit 00 opened up into the wide expanse of the sky, and for a moment Rei continued looking at the sun before her immediate task drew her away. With the Lance of Longinus in hand, Unit 00 leaned backwards a little, before it took several running steps along the raised pavement, and threw the lance.  
零号机展开双翼，面对广阔的天空，雷伊一时凝视着太阳，直到任务的紧迫感将她拉回现实。手持朗基努斯之枪，零号机微微后仰，随即沿着高耸的路面疾跑几步，猛地将长枪投掷出去。

The Lance of Longinus was duly named as the spear that could pierce heaven and earth, as the heavens parted in its path. Clouds looked as though they ran away from the lance, as it soared upward through the sky, creating a massive hole in the sky that stretched for thousands of miles without a cloud in sight.  
朗基努斯之枪名副其实，能贯穿天地，它所经之处，天空仿佛被撕裂。云层如同逃避般从长枪两侧散开，它直冲云霄，在天空中划出一道绵延数千英里、不见一丝云彩的巨大裂痕。

As it passed out of the atmosphere of the planet, it flew towards the angel waiting patiently in space. The lance struck the angels AT-field, pausing momentarily, as the tip of the lance pierced through the angels AT-field and ripped through the rest of it. What came next could only be described as the angel seeming to be sucked up by a massive black hole. The lance seemed to fly right through the angel, but as it hit the angel, a small vortex appeared where the lance had struck. Not even a second later, the vortex encompassed the entire angel until a reverse effect started, where the main body of the angel started to getting sucked into the vortex, while the forking branches slowly were drawn in also. In the span of two seconds, the entire angel had disappeared, leaving little to suggest its existence, except for the shattered mind of Asuka that remained.  
当它穿过行星的大气层，向着太空中耐心等待的天使飞去。长枪击中了天使的 AT 力场，短暂停顿后，枪尖穿透了天使的 AT 力场并撕裂了其余部分。接下来的一幕只能形容为天使仿佛被一个巨大的黑洞吞噬。长枪看似径直穿过了天使，但当它击中天使时，长枪所触之处出现了一个小漩涡。不到一秒钟，漩涡便吞没了整个天使，随后发生了逆转效应，天使的主体开始被吸入漩涡，分叉的枝条也缓缓被牵引进去。短短两秒内，整个天使消失无踪，除了留下破碎心灵的明日香，几乎没有任何存在的痕迹。

"Pattern blue has disappeared."  
“蓝色模式已经消失。”

"What about the Lance of Longinus?" asked Fuyutsuki.  
“那朗基努斯之枪呢？” 冬月问道。

"Unknown." "未知。"

"There is currently no known way of retrieving something with that amount of mass," said Gendo suddenly. "And something of that nature should not be in the hands of humans in the first place," he finished.  
"目前尚无已知方法能够回收如此大量质量的物体，" 源堂突然说道。"而且，那种性质的东西本就不该落入人类手中，" 他补充道。

Nodding his head slowly, understanding the inner meaning of his words, Fuyutsuki said, "Give all priority to the retrieval of Unit 02 and its pilot. Dr. Akagi, you're in charge of this. Isolate the pilot if need be and...prep a medical team of what they might expect. Mental contamination, cellular contamination, irregular brain patterns..."  
缓缓点头，理解了他话中的深意，冬月说道："将所有优先权赋予二号机及其驾驶员的回收工作。赤木博士，此事由你负责。必要时隔离驾驶员，并...准备一支医疗团队应对可能的情况。精神污染、细胞污染、异常脑波..."

"And what are you going to do?" asked Misato, anger slowly seeping off her in the way the operation was handled.  
"那你打算怎么办？" 美里问道，愤怒在她处理这次行动的方式中逐渐消散。

"...The pilot of Unit 01 may have to be confined because of circumstances. I suppose that I'll have to-"  
"...由于情况特殊，01 号机驾驶员可能需要被隔离。我想我得——"

"No, I'll do it," said Misato. "I know him better then you do."  
"不，我来处理，" 美里说，"我比你们更了解他。"

Fuyutsuki eyed her for a moment before he sighed and admittedly said, "I suppose that you are correct about this."  
冬月盯着她看了一会儿，然后叹了口气，不得不承认道：“我想你在这点上是正确的。”

Misato bit back her retort and looked towards Ritsuko, signaling that she wanted a full report of Asuka's condition later. Without so much as a glance at commander Ikari, she proceeded to the elevator, and went to the lower levels of Nerv, anticipating what would be her worst talk with Shinji yet.  
美里忍住了反驳的话，转向律子，示意她稍后要详细报告明日香的情况。她没有多看碇司令一眼，径直走向电梯，前往 NERV 的低层，预感到这将是对真嗣最艰难的一次谈话。

---

After the entry plug of Unit 01 had been forcefully ejected, Shinji couldn't remember anything until moments ago when he woke up in a room that seemed to be little better than a cell. The room was virtual pitch black, except for a door at the far end of the room where a small window was placed towards the top of the door. A small glow of light could be seen out in what he guessed as some sort of corridor. He suspected that they had tranquilized him with something, knocking him out momentarily so he wouldn't be able to resist. But now, blinking the feeling of nauseous and dizziness away, he stood up and walked to the door, and looked out through the small window. What he saw didn't really surprise him. Two armed guards seemed to standing on either sides of the door, guards which he supposed wouldn't hesitate to shot if they felt like it.  
在初号机的插入栓被强行弹出后，真嗣直到刚才醒来之前，什么都不记得了。他发现自己身处一个房间，比起牢房好不了多少。房间内几乎漆黑一片，只有远端的一扇门上方有一个小窗。透过小窗，可以看到外面走廊微弱的灯光。他猜测他们可能给他注射了什么镇静剂，让他暂时失去意识，无法反抗。但现在，他眨了眨眼，驱散了恶心和眩晕感，站起身走向门边，透过小窗向外望去。他所看到的并不令他意外。两名武装警卫似乎分别站在门的两侧，他猜想如果他们觉得有必要，会毫不犹豫地开枪。

Turning around, he let his entire body weight press against the door with his back, and slowly slid down onto the cold, hard, concrete floor. Drawing his knees up to his chest, he rested his head on them and started wondering what his first step should be.  
他转过身，用背部抵住门，缓缓滑坐在冰冷坚硬的水泥地上。他蜷缩起双腿，将头靠在膝盖上，开始思考第一步该怎么做。

His first thought was to break out and find Asuka, but a small part of his mind felt that wouldn't be the smartest. He wanted to see Asuka, to know that she was all right, to simply embrace her tightly and run a hand of his through her hair. But he knew that he couldn't...not now.  
他的第一个念头是冲出去找到明日香，但内心深处有一小部分觉得这并非明智之举。他渴望见到明日香，确认她安然无恙，只想紧紧拥抱她，用他的手轻抚她的秀发。但他明白，现在不行。

Before, when they had argued, Shinji had no idea what was to come. Now he would give anything to take back the hurtful words he had used against her. And then when she tried to talk with him later, inside the Eva's chamber, he had shrugged her off, saying that they would talk later.  
以前，当他们争吵时，真嗣并不知道接下来会发生什么。如今，他愿意付出一切来收回那些曾对她说过的伤人话语。而当她后来试图在 EVA 的机舱内与他交谈时，他却推脱说稍后再谈。

He was ashamed of his himself, on how he had reacted. He had shown Asuka something that she should never have seen again, but he was trying to make her understand why he suddenly associated with Rei who he had rarely talked with before. He didn't blame her for her jealousy, it was rather expected at some form or another. God knows he'd feel the same thing if he saw her talking with some other guy that he'd never met before.  
他为自己当时的反应感到羞愧。他向明日香展示了本不该再让她看到的一面，而他正试图让她理解为何自己突然与之前很少交流的丽亲近起来。他不怪她嫉妒，这在某种程度上是可以预料的。天知道如果他看到她和某个从未谋面的男人交谈，他也会有同样的感受。

"Even so though," he said speaking to the small room. "If I could at least know how she was...it'd ease my mind a little."  
"即便如此，" 他对着狭小的房间说道，"如果我能至少知道她怎么样了...这会让我稍微安心些。"

Almost as though in response to his wish, the metal door opened with a creak, and in walked Misato.  
仿佛回应他的愿望一般，金属门吱呀一声打开了，美里走了进来。

"I'm sorry about the way you were treated," she said upon entering, not letting Shinji open his mouth. "I'm moving you to a different room."  
"对于你受到的待遇，我感到很抱歉，" 她一进门就说道，没让真嗣有机会开口，"我要把你转移到另一个房间。"

"What about the guards?" asked Shinji.  
“那卫兵呢？”真嗣问道。

"I know I can't do much to ease your pain, but I can do this much at least."  
“我知道我无法减轻你的痛苦，但至少我可以做到这一点。”

Holding out her hand, Shinji took it unhesitatingly, and they walked out of the room, which seemed to be vacant of the guards now.  
她伸出手，真嗣毫不犹豫地握住，两人走出了房间，此刻房间里似乎已经没有了卫兵的踪影。

"What did you-" "你刚才说什么-"

"Forget about it." "别提了。"

"...Okay then...where are we going?"  
"...好吧...那我们去哪儿？"

"I'm not sure about that myself. I can't think straight right now. All I know is that I'm extremely displeased on how this entire ordeal was handled."  
"我自己也不太确定。我现在脑子一片混乱。我只知道我对整个事件的处理方式极为不满。"

"...Ordeal?" "...事件？"

"The operation! It was as though they had planned to use the Lance of Longinus since the very beginning."  
"行动！就好像他们从一开始就计划使用朗基努斯之枪一样。"

"And what is the Lance of Longinus exactly?"  
"那么，朗基努斯之枪究竟是什么？"

"Its supposedly a holy relic that was used in the crucifixion of Christ. Though its also able to penetrate an angels AT-field."  
"据说是在耶稣受难时使用的圣物。不过，它还能穿透天使的 AT 力场。"

"Something that even I can't defend against," mumbled Shinji. "Great."  
"连我都无法防御的东西，"" 真嗣喃喃自语，""真是太好了。"

"Well its floating in space now, so at least it can't be used again."  
“好吧，它现在漂浮在太空中，所以至少不能再被使用了。”

"Misato...I know that you're probably trying to avoid this...but how is Asuka?"  
“美里...我知道你可能在试图回避这个问题...但明日香怎么样了？”

His blunt question suddenly made Misato freeze in mid-step. Turning slowly towards him, she said, "That is essentially why I'm here. I've been...designated as the person to tell you."  
他直截了当的问题突然让美里在半空中停住了脚步。她缓缓转向他，说道：“这正是我来这里的原因。我被...指定为告诉你这件事的人。”

"Tell me what?" said Shinji, his eyes instantly narrowing.  
"告诉我什么？" 真嗣说道，眼睛立刻眯了起来。

Misato hesitated for a second but said, "Asuka's condition is...unknown right now. The decontamination procedures may take several hours before a report is even sent in about her physical condition. As for her mental condition...well its almost certain that there was a high level mental contamination."  
美里犹豫了一会儿，但还是说道："明日香的状况目前...未知。去污程序可能需要几个小时才能提交关于她身体状况的报告。至于她的精神状况...嗯，几乎可以肯定存在高级别的精神污染。"

"Meaning what...exactly!" Shinji's voice growing louder even when he didn't mean it to.  
"具体是什么意思...！" 真嗣的声音不自觉地变大了。

"Shinji...the angel seemed to be analyzing her mind. Her mental graph starting going sporadic, as though she was being forced to see many different things at once and process them all. Its unknown what state of mind she may be in because of this."  
"真嗣...天使似乎在分析她的内心。她的精神图谱开始变得杂乱无章，仿佛被迫同时看到并处理许多不同的事物。由于这种情况，她可能处于何种心理状态尚不得而知。"

"So what! It'll just pass right?"  
"那又怎样！不就是一会儿的事吗？"

"Shinji...her mind may be broken. She'd be in a comatose like state where her body functions properly, but her mind doesn't respond. She'd no longer be able to recognize people, she wouldn't be able to learn, essentially...the person known as Asuka would cease to exist. She wouldn't have any memories."  
"真嗣...她的心智可能已经崩溃。她会陷入一种类似昏迷的状态，身体机能正常，但心智不再响应。她将无法再认出人，无法学习，本质上...名为明日香的人将不复存在。她将失去所有记忆。"

Shinji stared blankly back at her for several minutes, her words unable to click with what his mind was screaming. Asuka not recognizing him? Bullshit! Not after everything they'd been through.  
真嗣茫然地盯着她看了好几分钟，她的言语无法与脑海中尖叫的现实对接。明日香不认识他？胡说八道！经历了那么多之后怎么可能？

Shaking his head determinedly, Shinji said, "I don't believe you. You're saying something like that without any knowledge of whats actually happening."  
真嗣坚决地摇了摇头，说道：“我不相信你。你这么说没有任何实际发生的事情作为依据。”

"Shinji...we don't even know if she's alive. Her heart...stopped, before contact with Unit 02 was lost."  
“真嗣……我们甚至不知道她是否还活着。她的心脏……在失去与二号机的联系之前就停止了。”

This last sentence penetrated Shinji so badly it felt as though a thousand needles had torn into his heart. Asuka...dead? No, thats not possible. First and foremost...she's Asuka. She's the unrivaled Evangelion pilot who can accomplish anything. She's somebody who would fight till the last second.  
这最后一句话对真嗣的冲击如此之大，仿佛有千针刺入他的心脏。明日香...死了？不，这不可能。首先...她是明日香。她是无所不能的福音战士驾驶员，能完成任何任务。她是那种会战斗到最后一秒的人。

"I can't believe that," said Shinji instantly.  
"我无法相信，" 真嗣立刻说道。

"Shinji liste-" "真嗣，听我说-"

"No! You listen!" he shouted. "Asuka is not dead! There is no fucking way that she could be dead! Sh-She's somebody who can't die! And we...haven't"  
"不！你听我说！" 他喊道。"明日香没有死！她绝不可能就这样死了！她是个不会死的人！而我们...还没有...

"Shinji...this isn't any easier for me. I had to stand aside while somebody else did my job. How do you think I feel? Hearing Asuka's screams yet unable to do anything to help her."  
"真嗣...这对我来说也不容易。我不得不站在一旁，让别人做我的工作。你以为我听到明日香的尖叫却无能为力，心里是什么感受？"

"You could have-" "你本可以...

"I could have! Shinji? Could you have done anything yourself?"  
"我本可以！真嗣？你自己能做些什么吗？"

Her words hurt, because they were the truth. No, he couldn't have done anything to help her, and that was the most painful of it all. To realize just how helpless he was in this situation, even when he promised her he would always be by her side, in turn helping each other when they stumbled.  
她的话刺痛了他，因为那是事实。不，他无法做任何事来帮助她，这才是最痛苦的。意识到自己在这种情况下是多么无助，尽管他曾向她承诺，无论何时都会在她身边，互相扶持，共同面对困境。

"And I think I understand more than you yourself realize Shinji."  
"我想我比你更了解你自己，真嗣。"

"What do you understand! You're a grownup! How could you possibly-"  
"你懂什么！你是个成年人！你怎么可能理解——"

"Because I know what the hurt of separation feels like! When me and," her words choked a little here, but she continued. "When me and Kaji split, do you know how painful that was? I thought that we were always going to be together, but that was just the naivety of my adolescent mind fooling me. Shinji, how does your hurt feel like right?"  
"因为我懂得分离的痛苦是什么感觉！当我，"她的声音在这里哽咽了一下，但她继续说道。"当我和加持分手时，你知道那有多痛苦吗？我以为我们会永远在一起，但那只是我青春期天真的想法在欺骗我。真嗣，你现在感觉到的痛苦是什么样的？"

"Like it was cleaved in two with a blunt ax. But what does-"  
"就像被一把钝斧劈成了两半。但那又有什么——"

"Shinji, you love Asuka..."  
"真嗣，你喜欢明日香……"

...Nothing else but these words could have silenced him. Turning away from her briefly, he didn't even seem to have the capacity to blush at her remark...no, it was a mark of how correct she was that he didn't blush. Because he had long figured this to be true, even if a small part of his mind denied it.  
"……除了这些话，没有什么能让他沉默。他短暂地避开她的目光，甚至似乎没有能力因她的评论而脸红……不，他没有脸红，这标志着她的话是多么正确。因为他早已意识到这一点，即使他内心的一小部分否认了这一点。"

"You do...don't you? And she does too."  
"你确实……不是吗？她也一样。"

Shinji was still silent, completely passive now as if they were talking about the weather.  
真嗣依旧沉默，此刻完全被动，仿佛他们只是在谈论天气。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"...What," he finally said.  
"...什么，"他终于开口道。

"What do you want to do?"  
"你想做什么？"

"I want to run to her. To hold her. To take her away from this damn place!" he said his voice growing louder with each sentence. "I want to tell her that everything will be all right! That I'll always be by her side! I want to run my hands through her amazing hair! I even want her to call me an idiot, just so that I can hear her voice! But...I can't...not now," he finished, his voice growing quiet.  
"我想跑向她，拥抱她，带她离开这个该死的地方！" 他的声音随着每句话变得更加响亮。"我想告诉她一切都会好起来的！我会一直在她身边！我想抚摸她那令人惊叹的头发！我甚至希望她叫我傻瓜，只为了能听到她的声音！但是...我不能...现在不行，" 他结束时，声音变得低沉。

"...Why is that?" "...为什么呢？"

"Because she's too dear to me...too important."  
"因为她对我来说太珍贵了...太重要了。"

"I don't-" "我不——"

"Because I'm afraid if I see her...we will hurt each other. She's not dead...that I know of...I don't know why, but I think I would have felt it. But...I don't think she knows me anymore."  
"因为如果我见到她...我们可能会互相伤害。她没有死...据我所知...我不知道为什么，但我觉得我会感觉得到。但是...我觉得她已经不认识我了。"

"How can you?" "你怎么能确定？"

"Know that? I don't rightly know. Call it intuition. You said the angel seemed to be analyzing Asuka's mind...I think it was searching for memories of me, just as the previous angel seemed to be waiting for me. There gone though...those memories, and they may never come back. I think...that they probably wont."  
"知道吗？我不太确定。就说是直觉吧。你提到天使似乎在分析明日香的心智……我觉得它可能在寻找关于我的记忆，就像之前那个天使似乎在等我一样。但那些记忆已经消失了……它们可能永远不会回来。我想……它们大概是不会回来了。"

"But Shinji..." "但是真嗣……"

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Just as you told me before...that I can't possibly know that. Even so...you can't either."  
"就像你之前告诉我的那样……我不可能知道。即便如此……你也不可能知道。"

"Thats where you are wrong, Misato. I have a corporeal AT-field that has an actual shape. Ever since the previous angel battle...I've become more attuned to peoples AT-fields so much that I can feel them. An AT-field is in essence, what a makes a person themselves. The second the pieces of Asuka memories broke, I felt the subtle difference in her own AT-field. But I didn't want to admit it...even after what you told me. She changed after she met me, she's admitted it herself. But now that the memories we built together are gone, its as though the different her never existed."  
"你错了，美里。我有一个实体化的 AT 力场，它有着具体的形状。自从上一次与使徒的战斗之后……我对人们的 AT 力场变得更加敏感，以至于我能感受到它们。AT 力场本质上是一个人自我存在的体现。当明日香的记忆碎片破碎的那一刻，我感受到了她 AT 力场中微妙的变化。但我不想承认这一点……即使在你告诉我之后。她在我遇见她之后确实改变了，她自己也承认了。但现在我们一起建立的记忆消失了，就好像那个不同的她从未存在过一样。"

"..."

"It hurts...and I understand you trying to console me...but you can't understand the hurt...its too deep, and especially after recent events."  
"这很痛苦……我理解你试图安慰我……但你无法理解这种痛苦……它太深了，尤其是在最近的事件之后。"

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"It may take her time to recover...certain parts of her mind have been fragmented."  
"她可能需要时间来恢复……她大脑的某些部分已经支离破碎。"

"...What?" "...什么？"

"I can't tell rightfully what those parts are though, since they don't include me."  
"我无法确切知道那些部分是什么，因为它们不包括我。"

"Then let me ask you this Shinji?"  
"那么，让我问你，真嗣？"

"What do you plan to do?"  
"你打算怎么做？"

"I'm...going to remain here at Nerv, while when Asuka recovers she'll be living with you again."  
"我...会继续留在 NERV，而当明日香康复后，她将再次与你同住。"

"But what about everybody at school? Wont they know...that somethings wrong when you and Asuka aren't talking at school."  
"但学校里的其他人怎么办？他们不会知道...当你和明日香在学校不说话时，有什么不对劲吗？"

"Thats a complicated matter. If Asuka and I never met, then I'd never end up talking to Touji, Kensuke, Hikari, or anybody else. I'd still be the misunderstood transfer student. It'd be unnoticed if I suddenly dropped out of school,"  
"这是个复杂的问题。如果我和明日香从未相遇，那么我也不会与东治、健介、光或者其他人交谈。我仍会是那个被误解的转学生。如果我突然退学，也不会引起注意，"

"Shinji, you just started going back though."  
"真嗣，你才刚开始回去呢。"

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "Its better this way. If I start associating with Asuka too much, the memories may resurface and this time really destroy her mind."  
摇了摇头，真嗣说：“这样更好。如果我开始过多地与明日香接触，那些记忆可能会重新浮现，这次真的会摧毁她的心智。”

"But Evangelion tests...and everything associated with work. Everybody here at Nerv already knows you and Asuka, and how were."  
“但福音战士的测试……以及与工作相关的一切。NERV 这里的每个人都已经知道你和明日香，以及你们曾经的样子。”

"And I can't change that. I got to know everybody through my own means, not through Asuka like the kids at school."  
"但我无法改变这一点。我是通过自己的方式了解每个人的，而不是像学校里的孩子们那样通过明日香。"

"Shinji this is too cruel."  
"真嗣，这太残酷了。"

"...I suppose it is." "……我想是的。"

"If you just talk to her..."  
"如果你只是和她谈谈..."

"...I can't...if I did I wouldn't be lead this fake life."  
"...我不能...如果我这么做了，我就不会过这种虚假的生活。"

Fake life. The fact was that he would be leading a fake life, one completely devoid of Asuka.  
虚假的生活。事实是，他将过一种完全虚假的生活，一种完全没有明日香的生活。

"I'd like to ask one thing of you though. If I'm correct...she shouldn't wake until tomorrow. I'd like...to say goodbye I suppose."  
"不过，我有一件事想拜托你。如果我没猜错的话...她应该要到明天才会醒来。我想...大概是想道个别吧。"

"Shin-" "真-

"I'm very serious about this Misato, although every cell in my body is screaming against my decision."  
"我对此非常认真，美里，尽管我身体的每一个细胞都在反对我的决定。"

"Shinji...what I want to know is...why?"  
"真嗣...我想知道的是...为什么？"

"Why are you doing all this for Asuka?"  
"你为什么要为明日香做这一切？"

"Well, you said it yourself...I love her."  
"嗯，你自己也说了...我爱她。"

Misato was rather taken aback by this simple answer.  
美里对这个简单的回答感到相当意外。

"Though if you want another explanation...I do have one. Someone once told me about the concept of time...and more importantly humanities ability to control their own time. I've never told anybody this except Ritsuko in very small bits, and always away from actual truth. First I have angel DNA in me, why I have no idea. Probably an experiment by my father or something. But I sometimes have...visions of people, like possibilities of their future. Asuka's father...the rape, all I had foresight because of these visions, and the rape in particular, I was able to prevent because of these visions. I've seen...more than my share of gruesome things because of these visions, all with their own possibilities. But they've helped prevent things...that I can't deny. All these things have one thing in common...based on what actions I take after seeing these visions, I can control a persons time...and not just people...the world also."  
“不过，如果你想听另一个解释……我确实有一个。曾经有人告诉我关于时间的概念……更重要的是人类控制自己时间的能力。除了在极小的片段中告诉过律子外，我从未向任何人透露过这一点，而且总是避开真相。首先，我体内有天使的 DNA，我也不知道为什么。可能是我父亲的一个实验什么的。但我有时会……看到人们的幻象，就像是他们未来的可能性。明日香的父亲……那次强奸，我之所以有预见，是因为这些幻象，尤其是那次强奸，我能够阻止是因为这些幻象。我见过……因为这些幻象，我看到了许多可怕的事情，每一件都有其可能性。但它们帮助我阻止了一些事情……这是不可否认的。所有这些事情都有一个共同点……基于我在看到这些幻象后采取的行动，我可以控制一个人的时间……不仅仅是人……还有世界。”

Misato mouth was slightly gaping during his explanation.  
在他说话的过程中，美里微微张开了嘴。

"I still don't rightfully understand it myself, and the futures of people keeping changing based on the simple actions they perform in there daily lives, so it is sometimes difficult to discern what the correct path, so to speak, to choose is. This last week...I've been thinking about Asuka more than normally, which is saying something. And I started thinking...would she have been better off if she had never met me? Well, I certainly hated the thought, but after thinking about it, many of the things that happened to her were indirectly related to me. I didn't have any foreknowledge of this happening though...but I feel as though this is a better outcome then what was waiting for her."  
"我自己也还没完全理解，而且人们的未来会根据他们在日常生活中的简单行为不断变化，所以有时很难辨别所谓的正确道路该选择哪一条。过去这一周...我比平时更多地想起了明日香，这已经说明了一些问题。我开始思考...如果她从未遇见过我，她会不会过得更好？虽然我讨厌这个想法，但仔细想想，她经历的许多事情都间接与我有关。虽然我之前并不知情...但我觉得这比她原本要面对的结果要好。"

"And what was that?" asked Misato, her voice trembling slightly.  
"那是什么？" 美里问道，她的声音微微颤抖。

"Death," said Shinji simply. "As long as I know that she's alive, I feel as though I can continue."  
"死亡，" 真嗣简单地回答。"只要我知道她还活着，我就觉得我可以继续前进。"

"But what about her? Did you ever think how she felt about this. You could have prevented this couldn't you?"  
"但关于她呢？你有没有想过她对此的感受。你本可以阻止这一切的，不是吗？"

"No, I couldn't...I really couldn't. I may have been able to help her regain her memories by using the part of my AT-field that houses my memories of her. But its too dangerous with her weakened mind. As I said, it might truly destroy her. No, for her, this is the safest option."  
"不，我做不到...我真的做不到。我或许能利用我 AT 力场中储存的关于她的记忆来帮助她恢复记忆。但这对她虚弱的头脑来说太危险了。正如我所说，这可能会真正摧毁她。不，对她来说，这是最安全的选择。"

"Shin-" "真-

"I'm sorry Misato...I don't think I can continue. I've said more or less everything that I needed to."  
"对不起，美里...我想我无法继续下去了。我该说的都已经说了。"

"But-" "但——"

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "Without me in her life...its safer."  
摇了摇头，真嗣说道：“没有我在她的生活中……这样更安全。”

"But-" she tried again, however Shinji was already walking past her.  
“但是——”她试图再次开口，然而真嗣已经从她身边走过。

"As I said, I'd like a final goodbye I can say...so if you could find out where she'll be kept...I'd much appreciate it."  
“正如我所说，我希望有一个我能说出的最后的告别……所以如果你能查出她将被安置在哪里……我将非常感激。”

Without another word, Shinji walked past Misato, leaving her rooted to the floor. However as soon as Shinji rounded the corner, Misato sunk to her knees, and placed the palm of her mouth over her hands.  
没有再多说一句话，真嗣从美里身边走过，留下她呆立在原地。然而，真嗣一转过拐角，美里便跪倒在地，双手捂住了嘴。

'I didn't know,' she thought. 'I didn't know the half of what he had gone through. And he kept it all bottled up inside him this whole time.'  
“我不知道，”她心想，“我不知道他经历了那么多。而他一直把这些都藏在心里。”

"Shinji," she mumbled as she continued sitting on the floor with her knees under her. "Is this really the right decision though?"  
“真嗣，”她喃喃自语，继续坐在地板上，双膝紧贴。“这真的是正确的决定吗？”

---

If this was the wrong decision, then Shinji may as well be damned for life.  
如果这是个错误的决定，那么真嗣或许一生都该被诅咒。

But he didn't care, as long as she was fine.  
但他不在乎，只要她安然无恙。

It was dark in the hospital room, but not so dark that he couldn't see the outline of her body laying in the bed. Her body was covered in strange devices, monitoring almost every known function of the human body. He'd have to thank Ritsuko sometime for the thoughtfulness she put into this.  
医院病房里很暗，但还没有暗到他看不清她躺在床上的轮廓。她的身体被各种奇怪的设备覆盖，几乎监测着人体已知的每一个功能。他得找个时间感谢律子，她在这件事上考虑得如此周到。

As Shinji walked towards Asuka's bed, he couldn't help but have second thoughts about this. He didn't want to leave, more than anything he just wanted to sit there and hold her hand while he waited for her to wake, but he knew that wouldn't be right. If she saw somebody totally unfamiliar to her stroking her hand, she'd certainly lose control.  
当真嗣走向明日香的床边时，他不禁心生犹豫。他不想离开，比任何时候都只想坐在那里，握着她的手，等待她醒来，但他知道那样做不合适。如果她看到一个完全陌生的人抚摸她的手，她肯定会失控的。

"'I know I can't do much to ease your pain, but I can do this much at least' huh?"  
“‘我知道我无法减轻你的痛苦，但至少我可以做到这一点’，嗯？”

At this thought, Shinji moved closer to her bed and looked down at the beautiful face of Asuka Soryu. She looked incredibly peaceful, laying there without a trace of pain on her face.  
想到这里，真嗣靠近了她的床，低头看着明日香·索伦美丽的脸庞。她看起来非常平静，躺在那里，脸上没有一丝痛苦的痕迹。

'Lets keep it that way,' he thought.  
“我们就保持这样吧，”他心想。

Sighing lightly, he looked down at her face for a few more seconds before saying, "Odd way to say goodbye to each. I always thought it be something along the lines of you kicking me out of a house sometime in the future...ahhh that was stupid. Ignore that..."  
他轻轻叹了口气，又低头凝视了她几秒钟，然后说道：“奇怪的告别方式。我总以为会是将来某天你把我从房子里赶出去之类的……啊，那真是蠢透了。别在意……”

He suddenly felt oddly stupid talking to her unconscious body.  
他突然觉得自己对着她无知觉的身体说话，显得异常愚蠢。

"What I guess I want to say is, even if you don't remember the times we had together. I'll always remember them. Your face, your smile, your laugh, that annoyed expression you got every time you looked at me. I'll remember them. If theres one thing I'll always regret, is that we didn't realize are feelings for each other sooner. Just being stubborn I suppose. "Anyways...I'd like to stay longer...but I think if I do, I'll never leave. However...if theres one thing I'd like, whether in a dream or not, is if you would remember this."  
"我想说的是，即使你不记得我们一起度过的时光，我也会永远记得。你的脸庞，你的微笑，你的笑声，每次你看向我时的那种恼怒表情。我都会记得。如果有一件事我永远会后悔，那就是我们没有早点意识到彼此的感情。大概只是因为固执吧。"总之...我想多待一会儿...但我觉得如果我这么做，可能就再也离不开了。然而...如果有一件事我希望的，无论是在梦中还是现实，就是希望你能记住这一点。"

Without another word, he kissed her.  
他一言不发，吻了她。

And afterwards, passed out of the room as if he were a breeze.  
随后，他像一阵风一样离开了房间。

---

And so we head into the final chapters.  
于是我们迈向了最后的篇章。

### Chapter 22: Rebuild

**Calm before the storm you could say for this chapter, though it was a lot of fun writing it. I'm hoping to get three chapters out a month so as to speed it to the end of summer. (But lets see how June goes now…)  
可以说是暴风雨前的宁静吧，这一章写得非常有趣。我希望能每月发布三章，以便在夏天结束前完成。（不过现在先看看六月的情况吧…）**

---

Asuka opened her eyes groggily into a room which was completely unrecognizable to her.  
明日香昏昏沉沉地睁开眼睛，发现自己身处一个完全陌生的房间。

'What am I doing here?' she wondered as she turned her head to and fro, looking every which way. As she tried raising her right arm though, she felt a sharp pain at the joint connecting her forearm and upper arm. Looking down at it, she thought she saw something that looked similar to a needle. Feeling rather claustrophobic, she pushed herself upwards, wincing at the creak in her joints, until her back was propped against the pillow she had been resting on.  
‘我在这里做什么？’她疑惑地左右转动头部，四处张望。当她试图抬起右臂时，却感到前臂与上臂连接处传来一阵剧痛。低头一看，她觉得自己看到了类似针头的东西。感到相当幽闭恐惧的她，忍着关节的嘎吱声，用力坐起身来，直到背部靠在了她之前躺着的枕头上。

The room she was, was like nothing she had ever seen before. The walls and ceiling were white with only a single lamp hanging from the ceiling, creating the only light in the room. All around her, an odd assortments of bags filled with some clear liquid and another which looked like blood, hung on plastic cords. Computers lined the wall along the far side of the room, directly across from her, and Asuka could see several windows open filled with strange formulas and numbers.  
她所在的房间，是她前所未见的景象。墙壁和天花板都是白色的，只有一盏吊灯从天花板垂下，是房间里唯一的光源。四周悬挂着各种奇怪的袋子，装着透明液体和看似血液的物质，挂在塑料绳上。房间远端的墙边排列着电脑，正对着她，屏幕上开着几个窗口，里面满是奇怪的公式和数字。

"Where in the hell am I?" she wondered openly this time, her frustration starting to become apparent.  
“我到底在哪儿？”这次她忍不住大声问道，显露出越来越明显的烦躁。

"In a hospital room at Nerv's research facilities," said a voice to her right.  
“在 NERV 研究设施的医院病房里，”她右边传来一个声音。

Asuka turned her head towards the sound of the voice, cricking it in the process, and stared back at the woman standing in the doorway. Very briefly however, a shadow of confusion seemed to pass over her face before she asked, "Ritsu...ko?"  
"明日香循声转头，过程中脖子发出咔嗒声，她盯着站在门口的女人。然而，仅一瞬间，她脸上掠过一丝困惑，随后问道：“理津子？””

"Glad to see that you still remember me," she replied as she entered the room and sat down on a chair next to Asuka's bed.  
“很高兴你还记得我，”她边回答边走进房间，坐在明日香床边的椅子上。

After a moments pause she asked, "How do you feel?"  
"片刻停顿后，她问道：“你感觉如何？””

Asuka took a second to reply as she looked down at her hands clasped together in her lap before she said, "I don't...really know. Everything feels...hazy. Why am I here? What happened?"  
明日香顿了顿才回答，她低头看着自己交叠在膝上的双手，然后说道：“我不……真的不知道。一切都感觉……模糊不清。我为什么在这里？发生了什么？”

"All in due time. First I need to ask you some quick questions. You obviously know my name already, so then do you remember your own name."  
“一切都会在适当的时候揭晓。首先我需要问你几个快速问题。你显然已经知道我的名字了，那么你记得自己的名字吗？”

"Asuka Langley Soryu," she replied without hesitating.  
“惣流·明日香·兰格雷。”她毫不犹豫地回答道。

"Good. Now can you tell me what month and day of the week it is?"  
"很好。现在你能告诉我今天是几月几号，星期几吗？"

"...Err...no, I can't remember it for some reason."  
"...呃...不，我不知为何记不起来了。"

"Thats okay. If you knew what day it was I would have been astounded. Now...I told you are in a research facility in Nerv. Do you know what Nerv is?"  
"没关系。如果你知道今天是哪天，我反而会感到惊讶。现在...我告诉过你，你现在身处 NERV 的研究设施中。你知道 NERV 是什么吗？"

Almost as though she was reading out of a textbook, Asuka replied, "Nerv, as it is known by the general public: is a union of companies tasked with the remodeling and reshaping of the entirety of Japan, and the slow shift of the capital city to Tokyo-3. This however is just a pretense for what it really does. Nerv is in fact tasked with the defense of humanity against an invasion of beings known as angels, using giant humanoids known as Evangelions."  
仿佛在照本宣科一般，明日香回答道：“Nerv，正如公众所知：是一个由公司组成的联盟，负责日本全境的改造与重塑，以及首都缓慢向第三新东京市的迁移。然而，这仅仅是其真实任务的幌子。Nerv 实际上负责抵御被称为使徒的入侵者，使用名为 EVA 的巨型人形兵器来保卫人类。”

"Almost word for word of what you wrote down for your section three test," replied Ritsuko while beaming.  
“几乎和你为第三部分测试写下的内容一模一样，”赤木律子微笑着回答。

"Of course, as if I could forget something so fundamental as that."  
“当然，我怎么可能忘记如此基础的东西。”

"Then what is your function at Ner-"  
“那么你在 NER-”

However before she could finish, Asuka said with a slight smirk, "I am the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit 02, while my sync ratio has an average of 88%. I'm German, though one-fourth Japanese on my mothers side. I was born on December 4, 2001, and am fifteen years old. Anything else you'd like to know?"  
然而，在她还没说完之前，Asuka 带着一丝得意的微笑说道：“我是 EVA 二号机的指定驾驶员，同步率平均为 88%。我是德国人，虽然母亲那边有四分之一的日本血统。我出生于 2001 年 12 月 4 日，今年十五岁。还有什么想知道的吗？”

Ritsuko slightly frowned at Asuka's attitude but accepted it for what it was.  
Ritsuko 对 Asuka 的态度微微皱眉，但还是接受了她的这种性格。

"It seems like you remember everything."  
"看来你记得所有事情。"

"Great. So then why am I here?"  
"很好。那我为什么在这里？"

Ritsuko continued looking at her for a moment, before she stood up and walked over to the computers on the opposite side of the room. After looking at many numbers on the screen with regards to Asuka's brain waves, she fished a cigarette out of her pocket, lit it, and said without looking at Asuka, "Do you remember anything about battling the angels."  
律子继续盯着她看了一会儿，然后站起来走到房间另一边的电脑前。在查看了屏幕上关于明日香脑电波的许多数据后，她从口袋里掏出一支烟，点燃，没有看明日香，说道：""你还记得与使徒战斗的任何事情吗？"

Asuka paused and seemed to search her mind.  
明日香停顿了一下，似乎在脑海中搜寻着什么。

"I do," she finally said. "But certain parts are...just blank. I defeated them all by myself though it seems like."  
“我记得，”她终于说道，“但有些部分……就是一片空白。不过，我好像是独自一人打败了它们。”

'As I figured,' thought Ritsuko. 'Every battle with the angels that she had with him has been replaced with herself fighting alone, thus creating the illusion of herself beating them all alone.'  
“正如我所料，”律子心想，“她与他共同对抗使徒的每一场战斗，都被替换成了她独自一人的战斗，从而营造出她独自击败所有使徒的假象。”

"Good. The blankness is to be expected however with certain events. But it seems that no lasting mental contamination has effected you."  
"很好。空白是某些事件后的预期反应。但看来你的心智并未受到持久污染。"

"Mental...contamination?"  
"心智...污染？"

"Yes...you're mind was invaded by an angel and analyzed several days ago."  
"是的...几天前，你的心灵被一位天使入侵并分析了。"

"Several days...ago?" "几天前……？"

"Yes...three to be exact. We were afraid that you're mind might have been broken, however it seems that you recovered miraculously well. We've been monitoring your life signs ever since then and its just now that you've awoken."  
"是的……确切地说是三天。我们担心你的心智可能已经崩溃，不过看来你奇迹般地恢复了。从那时起我们就一直在监测你的生命体征，直到现在你才苏醒。"

"By the angel invaded my mind...what do you mean?"  
"天使侵入了我的心灵……你这是什么意思？"

"They angel used an energy pattern with a similar signature to that of an AT-field, but as though it were in reverse. It seemed to pick apart your memories and mind, so having some stuff thats rather blank isn't too unsurprising."  
"那个天使使用了一种能量模式，与 AT 力场的特征相似，但似乎是反向的。它似乎在拆解你的记忆和心灵，所以有些部分空白并不太令人意外。"

Asuka was rather stunned after realizing that her mind had been sullied and opened her mouth slightly.  
意识到自己的心灵被玷污并被打开后，明日香相当震惊，微微张开了嘴。

"I know this is rather a lot to take in Asuka, but I can guarantee you that nothing has changed."  
"我知道这对你来说很难接受，明日香，但我可以向你保证，一切都没有改变。"

"...What happened to the angel?"  
"...天使怎么了？"

"It was destroyed...by Rei."  
"被摧毁了...被丽。"

"The pet! Did she also rescue me!" asked Asuka, her anger only too apparent.  
"那只宠物！她也救了我吗？" 明日香问道，她的愤怒显而易见。

"Well yes. But Asuka, if she hadn't destroyed the angel when she did, the damage you incurred may have become permanent."  
"嗯，是的。但明日香，如果不是她及时摧毁了使徒，你所受的伤害可能会变成永久性的。"

"I don't care! Its too humiliating being saved by her or anyone!"  
"我不在乎！被她或任何人救了，实在太丢脸了！"

Ritsuko had forgotten just how much Asuka had changed in these past months.  
律子忘记了这几个月里明日香变化有多大。

"I can understand your need to prove yourself, but you're alive, and you should be grateful for that."  
"我能理解你证明自己的需要，但你活着，应该为此感到庆幸。"

"I don't care," Asuka said, turning her head away from Ritsuko. "I'm not gonna grovel in front of somebody who has no human emotions."  
"我不在乎，" 明日香说着，把头转向一边，不再看律子。"我不会在没有人情味的人面前卑躬屈膝。"

"Well at least you seem to be yourself," said Ritsuko, ending the conversation instantly.  
"至少你看起来还是你自己，" 律子说完，立刻结束了对话。"

"Great, so when can I get out of here?"  
"太好了，那我什么时候能离开这里？"

"Soon most likely. I have to run a few more tests to be positive that there's no contamination before you move back in with Misato."  
"很快，大概吧。我得再做几个测试，确保没有污染，你才能搬回去和美里一起住。"

"Oh...thats right," Asuka said with a rather surprised look on her face. "I'm living with her."  
"哦...对了，" 明日香脸上带着相当惊讶的表情说，"我和她住在一起。"

"Yes you are, and she's been asking me every day about updates on your condition."  
"是的，你确实是，她每天都问我关于你病情的最新情况。"

"So she was worried huh?" wondered Asuka, feeling sorta touched.  
"看来她很担心呢？" 明日香想着，感到有些感动。"

"Yes, she...blamed herself partially because of your condition."  
"是的，她...因为你的病情，她部分地责怪自己。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because she relies on you so much."  
"因为她太依赖你了。"

Asuka's pride, already swollen to begin with, seemed to swell to the size of a small elephant.  
原本就高傲的明日香，此刻的骄傲仿佛膨胀到了小象那么大。

"Well," she said with an arrogant look on her face, "everybody _does_ rely on me."  
"好吧，"" 她脸上带着傲慢的表情说，""大家都依赖我。"

"Yes, well...I'll be back later to check your reflexes and any physical changes that may have happened to your body, though its not expected that I'll find anything. You should be discharged later today."  
"是的，好吧...我稍后会回来检查你的反射和身体可能发生的任何变化，不过预计不会发现什么。今天晚些时候你应该就能出院了。"

"Okay...um what time is it?"  
"好的...呃，现在几点了？"

Looking at her watch, Ritsuko said, "Just before noon. You should be in your own room before five."  
看了看手表，律子说：“刚过中午。你应该能在五点前回到自己的房间。”

"Great, because this bed isn't anything like my own."  
"太好了，因为这张床和我自己的完全不一样。"

"Yes...well, I should get going."  
"是的……嗯，我该走了。"

Before Asuka was able to ask her any more questions, Ritsuko left, closing the door behind her, and turned towards her left where she knew somebody would be waiting for her.  
在明日香能问出更多问题之前，律子离开了，关上门，转身向左走去，她知道那里有人正在等她。

"How is she?" asked Misato while she continued looking across the hallway, her back resting against the white sheet-rocked wall.  
"她怎么样了？" 美里一边问，一边继续望着走廊对面，背靠在白色的石膏墙上。

"Fine, in the normal sense of the word. No mental contamination and it seems that her memory seems to be mostly intact."  
"就正常意义来说，还好。没有精神污染，而且她的记忆似乎大部分都完好无损。"

"Mostly?" "大部分？"

"Everything relating to him has been replaced with the illusion of things she did alone, including the angel battles they participated in."  
所有与他相关的一切都被替换成了她独自完成的幻象，包括他们参与的天使战斗。

"I thought as much...what about-"  
我也是这么想的...那关于——

"There is no lasting impression of that incident. The body...may remember it, but the mind wont. From what I understood, if she had never gone to that grocery store, it would not have happened. Since in her mind, she never went to the grocery store, it never happened."  
那次事件没有留下持久的印象。身体...或许记得，但心智不会。据我所知，如果她从未去过那家杂货店，这一切就不会发生。因为在她心里，她从未去过那家杂货店，所以那件事从未发生过。

"Thats a relief I suppose," said Misato thinking that at least something good had come out of this.  
“那倒是让人松了口气，我想，”美里说道，心想至少这件事还算是个好消息。

"And what about her father?"  
“那她父亲呢？”

"I am not sure what happens with that. Of course, he's disabled so its rather irrelevant whether it effects him or not. His damaged brain does not remember how he ended up in that state in the first place, so its unknown if he did remember, whether those memories would have been erased or not. But as for Asuka, my guess is she does not know about her father, nor do I think she would really care.  
“我不确定那会怎么样。当然，他残疾了，所以是否影响到他并不重要。他受损的大脑已经不记得自己是怎么变成那样的，所以即使他记得，也不知道那些记忆是否会被抹去。至于明日香，我猜她不知道她父亲的事，我也不认为她会真的在意。”

Misato hesitated for a second before she asked, "Does he know that Asuka is awake yet?"  
美里犹豫了一会儿才问道：“他还不知道明日香已经醒了吗？”

"No...I thought I would let you break the news to him, though last I heard he was in Unit 02's chamber.  
“不……我想让你来告诉他这个消息，不过我上次听说他在二号机的驾驶舱里。”

"...Again?" “……又去了？”

"Yes...and we still aren't sure about the pattern blue that was detected inside Unit 02, however we know that the pattern blue detected before while we were doing the test of Unit-03 is the same as was detected three days ago."  
"是的...我们仍然不确定在二号机内部检测到的蓝色图案，但我们知道，之前在测试三号机时检测到的蓝色图案与三天前检测到的是相同的。"

"So it had nothing to do with the psychic attack against Asuka by the angel."  
"所以这与天使对明日香进行的精神攻击无关。"

"No...it didn't, which makes me worried about some sort of outside interference. But its best if we don't talk about that...I'm sure you realized about the tightening of security."  
"不...无关，这让我担心某种外部干扰。但最好我们不要谈论这个...我相信你已经注意到了安全措施的加强。"

"I have, and hope that I'm not feeling paranoid or anything."  
"我确实有这种感觉，希望自己不是在疑神疑鬼。"

"You'd have a right to be. You already heard about the fourth?"  
"你有理由这么想。你已经听说第四个的事了吗？"

"Yes...they met not to long ago."  
"是的...他们不久前刚见过面。"

Ritsuko bit down on her lip slightly before saying, "His first synchronization test is supposed to be today."  
律子轻咬了一下嘴唇，然后说道：“他的第一次同步测试应该是今天。”

"How? He doesn't even have an Evangelion thats his."  
“怎么可能？他甚至没有属于自己的 EVA。”

"Thats...supposed to not matter. He seems to be able to freely synchronize himself with almost any Eva."  
“那……应该不是问题。他似乎能够自由地与几乎任何 EVA 同步。”

"Any?" "有吗？"

"Unit 01 will most likely refuse the synchronization, since only one person has ever been able to pilot it effectively. Most likely Unit 02 will be chosen as the replacement since we're still unsure whether Asuka will be able to pilot again, or if any mental trauma makes her unable to pilot."  
"零一号机很可能会拒绝同步，因为迄今为止只有一个人能有效驾驶它。最有可能选择二号机作为替代，因为我们还不确定明日香是否能再次驾驶，或者任何心理创伤是否使她无法驾驶。"

"But what about the pattern-"  
"但模式怎么办——"

"The commander knows where the fourth comes from, as I'm sure you do too. He knows that the fourths an agent sent to spy on him, and the loss of the Lance of Longinus is a blow that they were unable to foresee."  
"指挥官知道第四使徒的来历，我相信你也清楚。他知道第四使徒是派来监视他的间谍，朗基努斯之枪的丢失是他们未能预见的打击。"

"Seele," whispered Misato, more to herself than at Ritsuko.  
"Seele，" 美里低声自语，与其说是对律子说，不如说是自言自语。"

"Anyway...you can go in and see her if you want, just watch what you say if we intend on continuing this ruse."  
"总之...如果你想进去看她，可以，只是如果我们打算继续这场骗局，说话要小心。"

"I don't...think I can yet."  
"我还不...觉得我能做到。"

"Still holding regrets?" "还在抱有遗憾吗？"

"No but...I feel that this could have been done differently."  
"不是遗憾，但...我觉得这件事本可以有不同的处理方式。"

Sighing lightly, Ritsuko passed Misato before whispering in her ear, "Just remember that we're not the ones hurt most deeply by this. And he wouldn't want you feeling sorry over something that isn't your fault."  
轻轻叹了口气，律子从美里身边走过，在她耳边低语道：“别忘了，我们并不是受伤害最深的人。而且他不会希望你为不是你的错的事情感到内疚。”

Smiling briefly at Misato, Ritsuko passed her, fishing another cigarette out of her pockets and lighting it quickly, before she rounded a corner and passed out of sight.  
律子对美里微微一笑，然后从她身边走过，迅速从口袋里掏出另一支烟点燃，转过拐角后便消失在视线之外。

Misato stood still for a moment, debating who she should talk to first. Asuka was her immediate choice, but she felt he deserved to know she was awake.  
美里静静地站了一会儿，思索着应该先和谁谈谈。明日香是她首先想到的人选，但她觉得他有权知道她已经醒了。

"Right...I suppose I should find Shinji then," she said openly, not caring whether anybody heard her or not.  
“好吧……我想我该去找真嗣了。”她坦然地说道，并不在意是否有人听到。

However, behind her a door closed with nothing but a snap.  
然而，在她身后，一扇门砰然关闭，只留下一声脆响。

---

Asuka stood with her back to the door she had just closed. After Ritsuko had left, she had grabbed the wires and cords that were connected to her body, and ignoring the sharp pain, had pulled them off herself. Everything still felt like a dream, but she found that her balance at least was still in tact, and she was able to plod slowly towards the door where she could hear Ritsuko and Misato talking behind it. A lot of things that they said didn't really register with her brain. She heard something about the fourth child, her father, something to do with her own Evangelion, and Misato had mentioned somebody by the name of Shinji just now, who she had never heard of in her life.  
明日香背对着她刚关上的门站立着。在律子离开后，她抓起连接在自己身上的电线和导线，不顾剧痛，硬生生地将它们扯了下来。一切仍像是一场梦，但她发现至少自己的平衡感还在，于是她能够缓慢地拖着步子走向那扇门，门后传来律子和美里交谈的声音。她们说的许多事情她的脑子并没有真正理解。她听到了关于第四适格者、她的父亲、与她自己的 EVA 有关的事，还有美里刚才提到的叫真嗣的人，她这辈子从未听说过。

"...Shinji," she mumbled to the empty room, running a hand through her hair as she said.  
"...真嗣," 她对着空荡荡的房间喃喃自语，一边说着一边用手梳理着头发。

"Hmph...sounds like an idiot."  
"哼...听起来像个白痴。"

---

While Misato went to Unit 02's chamber to look for Shinji, the boy in question had already long left the Nerv facilities and ended up walking around Tokyo-3, in fact, he found that he was doing this more and more lately.  
当美里前往 02 号机库寻找真嗣时，这个男孩其实早已离开了 NERV 设施，不知不觉中在第三新东京市闲逛起来，事实上，他最近发现自己越来越频繁地这样做。

The past three days for Shinji, well, he simply was surprised he had made it this long without going insane. Each day was a simple fight to not rush to Asuka's bed side. He found though, that these walks that he had now started to take cleared his mind exceptionally well, and he was reminded of why he used to walk so much. It was to get away from everything. But didn't that also mean he was running away from his problems? Also, these past few days he had noticed something which he had already been afraid of ever since he had promised himself he would never try to redevelop the relationship him and Asuka had. But it wasn't any easier to admit that his feelings were-  
过去的这三天对真嗣来说，他简直惊讶自己居然能撑这么久没疯掉。每一天都是一场简单的斗争，不让自己冲到明日香的床边。然而，他发现现在开始散步能极好地清理思绪，也让他记起了自己曾经为何走那么多路。是为了逃避一切。但这不也意味着他在逃避自己的问题吗？此外，这几天他注意到了一些事情，自从他发誓再也不会尝试重建与明日香的关系以来，他一直害怕这些事情。但承认自己的感情并没有变得更容易——

"Shinji-kun, I'm surprised to see you here."  
“真嗣君，在这里见到你真让我惊讶。”

Shinji spun around so quickly that for a second his hands seemed to be blurred as he brought them up to generate an AT-field, briefly thinking of decapitating the person who interrupted his thoughts, when he saw that it was Kaoru.  
真嗣迅速转身，以至于一瞬间他的手似乎模糊了，他举起手来生成 AT 力场，脑中闪过要斩断打断他思绪的人的念头，但当他看到那是薰时，动作停了下来。

Freezing his hands in mid swing, he glared back at Kaoru before snarling, "What'd you want? I'm not in the mood to talk right now!"  
在挥手的半途中僵住了双手，他回头怒视着薰，咆哮道：“你想干嘛？我现在没心情聊天！”

"Talk? No, I'm just surprised that you're not at Nerv."  
“聊天？不，我只是惊讶你居然不在 NERV。”

"Whats there for me?" grumbled Shinji.  
“我在那里有什么事可做？”真嗣咕哝着。

"True...well I suppose that I'll see you later Shinji-kun."  
"真的...嗯，我想我稍后会见到你，真嗣君。"

As Kaoru walked past him, Shinji noticed that he seemed to be heading towards the Nerv elevator he had just come up.  
当薰走过他身边时，真嗣注意到他似乎正朝着他刚刚上来的 NERV 电梯走去。

"Are you...going to Nerv?" asked Shinji hesitantly.  
"你...要去 NERV 吗？" 真嗣犹豫地问道。

Turning around, Kaoru said with a smile, "Yes, I am. I have a synchronization test in an hour."  
转过身来，薰微笑着说：“是的，我有一个同步测试，一小时后进行。”

Still hesitating, unsure how much he cared to know, Shinji eventually asked, "How? There isn't an Eva that would respond to you."  
仍然犹豫不决，不确定自己有多想知道，真嗣最终问道：“怎么可能？没有一部 Eva 会回应你。”

Shrugging slightly, with a smile still seemingly plastered on his face, Kaoru said, "No, there shouldn't be. However they still want to run some tests."  
微微耸肩，笑容依旧挂在脸上，薰说：“确实不应该有。但他们还是想做一些测试。”

"Why bother?" said Shinji still feeling like shit.  
“何必呢？”真嗣说道，依旧感觉糟透了。

"My synchronization rating is abnormally high like your own, they probably want to...find out why."  
“我的同步率异常地高，就像你一样，他们大概是想……找出原因。”

At his words, Shinji narrowed his eyes slightly. Since his first encounter with Kaoru, he had never really liked him. He always wore that smile on his face, but the eyes were different: cold and mocking. Then there was his suspicion about him having an AT-field such as his own, and now he learns that he has a strangely high synchronization also.  
听到这话，真嗣微微眯起了眼睛。自从第一次遇到薰以来，他从未真正喜欢过他。他总是面带微笑，但眼神却不同：冷漠且嘲讽。再加上对他拥有与自己相似的 AT 力场的怀疑，现在又得知他的同步率也异常地高。

"I doubt they'll learn anything they didn't already from testing me," Shinji eventually said.  
"我怀疑他们从测试我中学不到什么新东西，" 真嗣最终说道。

"Maybe, maybe not. I'm not you, so things will not be the same. Where were you going though, if you don't mind me asking?"  
"或许会，或许不会。我不是你，所以情况不会完全相同。不过，如果你不介意我问的话，你原本打算去哪儿？"

Sighing heavily, Shinji said, "I don't rightly know myself."  
真嗣重重地叹了口气，说："我自己也不太清楚。"

"Well, if you decide on returning before my test, you can see everything with your own eyes."  
“好吧，如果你在我考试前回来，你就能亲眼看到一切。”

Smiling again, as though he was inviting Shinji to go with him, Kaoru continued walking down the sidewalk, hands thrown behind his head, leaving Shinji standing there, confused about his last words.  
他又笑了笑，仿佛在邀请真嗣和他一起去，薰继续沿着人行道走，双手枕在脑后，留下真嗣站在那里，对他的最后一句话感到困惑。

'He knows something about me,' thought Shinji as he watched Kaoru's retreating back. 'And he supposedly came from Seele, so he's watching both me and my father.'  
“他对我有所了解，”真嗣看着薰远去的背影想道，“而且他据说是从 Seele 来的，所以他既在观察我，也在观察我父亲。”

Shinji continued standing still for a minute until Kaoru had rounded the corner at the end of the block.  
真嗣继续静静地站了一分钟，直到薰绕过街区尽头的拐角。

'Well, at least I think I know where to go now,' thought Shinji as he turned his head towards the most inhospitable part of Tokyo-3.  
'嗯，至少我想我知道现在该去哪儿了，'真嗣想着，将头转向了第三新东京市最不友好的区域。

He was going to see the one person who he felt could give him some good heartfelt advice.  
他打算去找那个他认为能给他一些真诚建议的人。

After walking for almost an hour, during which he reminded himself that Kaoru's synchronization test would be commencing, he gazed at the sign above the shop that read, '_Cafe.'_ Nothing seemed to have changed since his last visit (which sorely reminded him of Asuka) of which he was rather thankful for. He wasn't sure how much change he could take in a week. Though as he placed a hand on the door nob, several things happened. First: he felt a vibration in his pocket meaning that the cell phone he had borrowed from Misato was going off. Second: he could see several large silhouettes inside the small cafe, all crowded around the counter. Instantly forgetting about the cell phone in his pocket, he threw the door open with such force that for a second, he thought he had forced the glass panes out. What greeted him was not an endearing sight.  
走了将近一个小时，期间他不断提醒自己，Kaoru 的同步测试即将开始，他抬头看向那家写着“咖啡馆”的招牌。一切似乎都与他上次来访时（这让他痛苦地想起了 Asuka）无异，对此他颇为感激。他不确定一周内还能承受多少变化。然而，当他把手放在门把手上时，几件事情同时发生了。首先：他感觉到口袋里的震动，这意味着他从 Misato 那里借来的手机响了。其次：他看到咖啡馆内几个高大的身影挤在柜台周围。他立刻忘记了口袋里的手机，猛地推开门，有那么一瞬间，他以为自己把玻璃窗都震碎了。迎接他的并非温馨的景象。

The two he had met before, Eein and Gonzo, were both leaning across the counter and seemed to be grappling with somebody, while two other thugs seemed to be jeering and laughing at the sight before them. It took Shinji all but half a second to move.  
他之前见过的两个人，Eein 和 Gonzo，正趴在柜台上，似乎在与某人扭打，而另外两个恶棍则在旁边嘲笑起哄。Shinji 几乎只用了半秒钟就冲了过去。

The two thugs were just turning around as the ringing sound of the bell from the door met their ears, only to be face to face with a very angry Shinji; he had cleared the distance between the door and the counter in two fluid steps. As the two thugs seemed to realize this kid wasn't somebody that they had to pull their blows on, they both reeled backwards to strike him in the face, but were quickly met with two palms smashing into their chins. Shinji, who may have been considered tall by Asuka (who was actually rather short), was still shorter than these two. However, pushing his feet upwards, he managed to thrust a palm against both of the thugs lower jaw. Adding way more force that he had intended, Shinji felt sooner than he heard, the crunching and grinding of the upper and lower jaw bones as they collided. Trying to ignore the sick feeling in his stomach, and the way a cold shivered traveled down his spine he let the two drop on either side of him, both of them completely unconscious.  
两个恶棍刚转过身，门口的铃声便传入耳中，迎面撞上怒气冲冲的 Shinji；他以流畅的步伐迅速从门口冲到柜台前。两人似乎意识到这小子不是他们可以手下留情的对象，便都后退一步，准备挥拳打向他的脸，却立刻被两记掌击狠狠砸在颚部。尽管 Shinji 在 Asuka（其实相当矮小）看来或许算得上高，但仍比这两个人矮。然而，他双脚发力，成功地用掌心猛击两人的下颚。施加了超出预期的力量，Shinji 先于听到，便感受到了上下颚骨碰撞时的碎裂与摩擦声。他努力忽视胃里的恶心感和脊背上窜过的寒意，任由两人倒在他两侧，完全失去了意识。

The noise though didn't go unnoticed from either Eein or Gonzo and soon they were both staring surprised at the teenager in front of him, pure hatred seeming to flow out of the pores of his body.  
然而，这动静并未逃过 Eein 和 Gonzo 的注意，很快他们便惊讶地盯着眼前的少年，仿佛他全身的毛孔都散发着纯粹的恨意。

"Oh yes...I remember," said Eein finally as he recognized Shinji. "You're that kid that interrupted me before, when I was getting my cut of sales. Well, I suppose you weren't entirely bluffing with the way you looked at me last time." He looked grimly down at the two fallen thugs next to Shinji and sneered at there unconscious form.  
"哦，是的...我记得，" Eein 终于认出了真嗣，"你就是那个之前打断我拿销售分成的小子。看来你上次看我的眼神并非完全虚张声势。" 他阴沉地看着真嗣身边倒下的两个打手，对他们的昏迷状态嗤之以鼻。

"Tch, its so hard to come by decent body guards. Though it looks as those two dropped quicker than I had thought." Looking back at Shinji, he said, "You're an interesting kid. How about working for me-"  
"啧，找到靠谱的保镖真是难。不过看来那两个家伙倒下的速度比我想象的还要快。" 他转头看向真嗣，"你是个有趣的小子。不如为我工作——"

"I'd no sooner work for you than wipe my ass with your shitty money."  
"我宁愿用你的臭钱擦屁股，也不愿为你工作。"

"Hmph, you don't know what you're missing. Whatever...if you won't listen then, I can just have you killed."  
"哼，你不知道自己错过了什么。算了……如果你不听，那我就只好让你消失。"

Gesturing to Gonzo, who had stood silent throughout the confrontation, he finally moved and seemed to draw something out from under the baggy sweatshirt he was wearing. At first, Shinji thought it was a knife, something like a switchblade, but next second as it came into better view, he realized that this wouldn't end well.  
他向一直沉默不语的 Gonzo 示意，后者终于动了，似乎从宽松的运动衫下抽出了什么。起初，真嗣以为那是一把刀，像是弹簧刀之类的东西，但下一秒当它更清晰地映入眼帘时，他意识到这不会有什么好结果。

"Its amazing how many of these are floating around on the black market," said Eein as he eyed the Glock in Gonzo's hand. "It comes standard issue with most police uniforms and I've heard that there was a sudden stockpile increase on the black market. Their a dime a dozen now."  
"这些在黑市上泛滥成灾，真是令人惊叹，" Eein 看着 Gonzo 手中的格洛克手枪说道，"它通常随大多数警服一起发放，我听说黑市上突然出现了大量库存。现在它们简直不值钱。"

Shinji held his gaze at the gun in Gonzo's hand, ready to make a sudden move if need be. However, what Eein then ordered Gonzo to do next threw Shinji for a loop.  
真嗣紧盯着刚左手中的枪，准备在必要时迅速行动。然而，伊恩随后命令刚左做的事情却让真嗣大吃一惊。

Reaching behind the counter, Gonzo seemed to grab something and struggle with it for a second before pulling it roughly onto the counter.  
刚左伸手到柜台后面，似乎抓住了什么东西，挣扎了一会儿才粗暴地将其拉到柜台上。

"Lets see whether you adjust that attitude of yours after this," sneered Eein as he ordered Gonzo to point the gun at the woman's head.  
“看看这次之后你还能不能保持那种态度，”伊恩冷笑着命令刚左把枪对准女人的头。

It took all of Shinji's control to not decapitate Gonzo right there as he saw what kind of condition Rebecca was in. Her lower lip was split, creating a small trickle of blood that dripped down her chin. Her right eye was slightly closed as though it was painful to keep it completely open. Her dark hair, which normally had a certain sheen, hung limply around her face and behind her while Shinji thought he saw more streaks of crimson then there should be. The amazing thing was, there wasn't a single streak of a dried tear on her face. She had not cried throughout it all, and even now a defiant look was still on her face as she gazed back at Shinji.  
看到丽贝卡的状况，真嗣几乎用尽所有自制力才没有当场斩杀贡佐。她的下唇裂开，渗出一丝血迹，沿着下巴滴落。右眼微微闭合，仿佛完全睁开会带来疼痛。她那平日里光泽动人的深色秀发，此刻却无力地垂在脸庞和背后，真嗣觉得那血迹的条纹似乎比应有的更多。令人惊讶的是，她的脸上没有一丝泪痕。她自始至终没有流泪，即便此刻，她依然带着倔强的表情回望着真嗣。

As Shinji took all this in, his mouth eventually opened slightly into something of shock, but then he closed it with a snap and turned towards Eein who was leaning against the counter and smirking.  
真嗣将这一切尽收眼底，他的嘴角最终微微张开，显露出震惊之色，但随即又猛地闭上，转向倚在柜台边、面带讥笑的艾因。

"She got a bit too snappy and I thought I should correct her," laughed Eein. Apparently he thought that Shinji was powerless with a gun pointed at somebody he cared for.  
“她有点太冲了，我觉得应该纠正一下。”艾因笑着说。显然，他认为真嗣在枪口对准他在乎的人时是无能为力的。

Speaking very clearly, annunciating with each word, Shinji said, "Let her go...or even I don't know what you'll look like after I'm done with you."  
申吉一字一顿，清晰地说道：“放开她……否则，连我自己都不知道你在我手下会变成什么样子。”

"Ha! I'll admit, you're a strange boy," said Eein. "But nobody is above the power of a gun. You're still flesh and blood."  
“哈！我承认，你是个奇怪的男孩，”伊恩说道，“但没人能超越枪的力量。你终究只是血肉之躯。”

'Well he is right there,' thought Shinji.  
“他的确说得没错，”申吉心想。

"So I'll give you two options, back up and leave...or die," finished Eein. "I don't care either way honestly, and the world would probably be better off without people like you."  
"所以，我给你两个选择，退后离开...或者死，" Eein 结束了他的话。"老实说，我无所谓，世界可能没有你们这样的人会更好。"

Shinji stood still with his hands hanging loosely at his side. He wondered how quickly Gonzo could turned the gun at him and pull the trigger.  
真嗣静静地站着，双手松松地垂在身侧。他不知道 Gonzo 能多快把枪转向他并扣动扳机。

'Probably not as fast as I could generate an AT-field...but its best not testing it.' He still never wanted to use his AT-field on another human being if he could help. But this was pushing him, and his angel self was starting to gain dominance over his mind.  
'可能没有我生成 AT 力场快...但最好不要测试。' 他仍然不想在能避免的情况下对另一个人类使用 AT 力场。但这种情况逼迫着他，他的天使自我开始逐渐占据他的心智。

"What did she say to you?" asked Shinji hesitantly, trying to delay the inevitable decision.  
"她对你说了什么？" 真嗣犹豫地问道，试图拖延不可避免的决定。

Eein paused for a second, as though trying to decide whether it was worth his time to answer the question.  
伊恩顿了一下，仿佛在考虑是否值得花时间回答这个问题。

"She asked why I took eighty percent of the profits even if it was only considered change to me. As if I needed to remind her that she was my property whether or not I took her earnings from her."  
"她问我为什么拿走百分之八十的利润，即使对我来说那只是零钱。好像我需要提醒她，无论我是否拿走她的收入，她都是我的财产。"

"But her mother," said Shinji still trying to delay.  
"但她的母亲，" 真嗣仍在试图拖延。

"I don't give two shits about her useless mother. She's nothing but a useless piece of flesh that will die off eventually. I've actually been considering turning this into a whore house with Becca here as the main attraction."  
"我对她那无用的母亲毫不关心。她不过是一块终将腐烂的肉。我甚至考虑过把这里变成妓院，让贝卡成为主要的卖点。"

If Shinji had been holding something, it would have snapped cleaning in two at Eein's words.  
如果真嗣手里拿着什么东西，在伊恩的话语下，它肯定会应声而断。

"I mean lets face it, there just aren't enough good fucks in this part of Tokyo-3. Now if I could get some of those overseas whores, that'd be good business. I heard that German red heads fuck like dogs."  
"我的意思是，面对现实吧，在东京-3 的这一带，好货色实在不多。如果能弄到些海外的妓女，那生意就不错了。我听说德国的红发女郎干起来像发情的狗一样。"

...Shinji's angel half at his point, completely took over.  
...在这个时刻，真嗣的天使半身完全占据了主导。

He stood still for a moment before he slowly fixed his eyes directly on Eein's and said in a whisper, "...Take that back."  
他静立片刻，然后缓缓将目光直射向 Eein，低声说道："...收回那句话。"

"Hmmm? Whats the matter? Do you have a thing for German red heads or something? Or could it be that you know somebody that fits that description?"  
"嗯？怎么了？你是对德国红发女郎有兴趣吗？还是说你认识某个符合这个描述的人？"

Shinji retorted in a voice completely unlike his own. It was forceful, almost as though it where a command, "Take that back."  
真嗣反驳道，声音完全不像他自己的。那是强有力的，几乎像是一个命令，“收回那句话。”

"And if I don't?" asked Eein mocking him.  
"如果我不呢？" 绫波反问他，嘲弄的语气。

Shinji's eyes, in reply, flashed a deep crimson.  
真嗣的眼睛回应着，闪烁着深红色。

Eein and Gonzo both saw this and for a moment seemed unsure of themselves, but in the end assumed it was a trick of the light.  
伊恩和贡佐都看到了这一幕，一时间似乎有些不知所措，但最终还是认为这只是光线造成的错觉。

"Fine then have it your way. Gonzo!"  
“好吧，那就随你的便。贡佐！”

For somebody so big and heavy, Gonzo was able to move his meaty arm quite quickly. Swinging the Glock around so that it pointed at Shinji, he pulled the hammer back and aim it at his chest.  
尽管身材高大且沉重，Gonzo 却能迅速移动他那粗壮的手臂。他将 Glock 手枪挥向 Shinji，使其指向他的胸膛，然后拉回击锤准备射击。

"Cya kid," laughed Eein just as Gonzo pulled the trigger.  
“再见了，小子，”Eein 大笑着，就在 Gonzo 扣动扳机的那一刻。

The Glock exploded, firing a three round burst directly at Shinji. The first bullet past directly over his right shoulder. The second bullet however found its mark, and buried itself into the shoulder that the first bullet had missed. His entire body was pushed backwards as the bullet hit him, jerking his body to the right. A crimson puff of mist seemed to explode outward from behind his shoulder, creating a one inch hole. The third bullet...never got very far past to chamber of the Glock.  
Glock 手枪发出轰鸣，射出一连串三发子弹直奔 Shinji。第一颗子弹恰好从他的右肩上方飞过。然而第二颗子弹找到了目标，深深嵌入了第一颗子弹未触及的肩膀。子弹击中他时，他的整个身体被向后推，猛地向右一晃。一团血红色的雾气似乎从他肩后炸开，形成了一个一英寸的洞。第三颗子弹……却未能从枪膛中射出多远。

With Shinji's angel self fully in control right now, he saw things differently. The first bullet he knew would pass directly over his right shoulder while the second bullet would hit his shoulder. The third bullet however would have ripped apart his right lung before burying itself in his spinal cord. No matter how abnormal Shinji was, he was still made of flesh and blood, as Eein had pointed out. He was able to regenerate the wound in the shoulder, but if the bullet exploded as it hit the spinal cord, he may as well be considered KIA. As such, he let himself be wounded before slicing the third bullet in two with his AT-field just as it left the Glock's chamber.  
现在，随着真嗣的天使自我完全掌控，他的视角变得不同。他知道第一颗子弹会直接从他的右肩上方飞过，而第二颗子弹则会击中他的肩膀。然而，第三颗子弹将会撕裂他的右肺，然后嵌入他的脊髓。无论真嗣多么异常，他仍然是血肉之躯，正如 Eein 所指出的。他能够再生肩部的伤口，但如果子弹在击中脊髓时爆炸，他几乎可以被视为阵亡。因此，他让自己受伤，然后在第三颗子弹刚离开 Glock 枪膛时用 AT 力场将其切成两半。

Eein and Gonzo both saw the second bullet hit him, but their vision was obscured briefly as a flash of orange lit up the room. This was of course the moment the third bullet was split.  
Eein 和 Gonzo 都看到第二颗子弹击中了他，但他们的视线被一瞬间的橙色闪光照亮所遮挡。当然，这就是第三颗子弹被分割的时刻。

"What happened?" asked Eein after a second when he saw that Shinji was still standing, completely ignoring the bullet wound in his shoulder. "Why isn't he dead? I though that thing was three round burst?"  
“发生了什么？”Eein 在看到真嗣仍然站立，完全无视肩上的枪伤后，过了一会儿问道，“他为什么没死？我以为那是三连发？”

"I don't know boss. I fired three bullets and that third one should have hit him."  
"我不知道，老大。我开了三枪，第三枪应该打中他了。"

"Well fire again you fucking retard!" yelled Eein.  
"那就再开枪，你这个该死的白痴！" Eein 吼道。"

As Gonzo aimed the gun again, there was another flash of orange light and this time, the gun seemed to be cloven from Gonzo's hand where it fell to the floor and shattered into several pieces.  
当 Gonzo 再次瞄准枪时，又一道橙色光芒闪过，这次，枪似乎被从 Gonzo 手中劈开，掉在地上摔成了几块。

"What the fuck!" "搞什么鬼！"

Eein asked this as he looked back at Shinji, who's eyes had become blood red.  
Eein 问道，同时回头看向 Shinji，后者的眼睛已经变得血红。

"I told you to take it back," said Shinji in that same cold emotionless voice as he took a step closer towards the two.  
"我说过让你收回那句话，" Shinji 用同样冰冷无情的声音说道，同时向两人迈进一步。

"Stop him damn it!" roared Eein at Gonzo.  
“阻止他，该死的！”伊恩对着刚佐咆哮道。

Hesitating slightly, as though trying to decide who was more dangerous: his boss or the kid in front of him, he eventually reached under his sweatshirt, and this time did extract a switchblade from underneath it. Charging straight at Shinji, who had not moved since he took that previous, he brought the knife up and swished it down, intending to stab it into Shinji's already wounded shoulder. However, he screamed in pain as the force he put behind the stab collided against Shinji's AT-field. It felt as though he had tried to stab a solid wall of concrete, sending vibrations up the fingers that were grasping the blade. Taking several steps back, he looked down at the blade which was bent in an odd direction, while his fingers were likewise in strange directions. Looking back horridly at Shinji, he mouthed like a fish out of water before the AT-field crashed against him, knocking the wind out and spewing blood out of his mouth as he went skidding across the floor.  
他犹豫了一下，似乎在试图决定谁更危险：是他的老板还是面前的孩子。最终，他伸手到运动衫下，这次确实掏出了一把弹簧刀。他径直冲向自始至终未曾动弹的 Shinji，举起刀猛地挥下，意图刺入 Shinji 已受伤的肩膀。然而，他痛苦地尖叫起来，因为他用力刺出的刀碰到了 Shinji 的 AT 力场。感觉就像他试图刺向一堵坚固的混凝土墙，震得握刀的手指发麻。他后退了几步，低头看着那把弯曲得奇怪的刀，手指也扭曲得不成样子。他惊恐地回头看向 Shinji，像离水的鱼一样张嘴，随后 AT 力场猛地撞击在他身上，让他喘不过气来，嘴里喷出血来，滑过地板。

Eein looked agape at Shinji as Gonzo came sliding to rest at his feet, and for the first time in his life, he looked scared.  
伊恩目瞪口呆地看着 Shinji，刚佐滑到他脚边，这是他一生中第一次，他看起来害怕了。

"Yo-You...who are yo-you?"  
"你...你是谁？"

Shinji was silent as he took another step forward, his eyes still blood red and the orange triangular like AT-field in front of him for all to see.  
真嗣沉默地又向前迈了一步，他的眼睛依旧血红，面前那橙色的三角形 AT 力场清晰可见。

"Stay back damn it! I-I have friends high up that wo-won't let you get away wi-with this."  
"别过来，该死的！我...我上面有朋友不会让你逃脱的。"

"Take it back," Shinji mumbled, all signs of his previous self gone.  
"收回那句话，" 真嗣喃喃道，他先前的自我已荡然无存。

"Okay...okay I take back what I said! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I won't ever bother Rebecca again! Just please don't kill me!"  
"好吧...好吧，我收回我说的话！对不起！对不起。我再也不会打扰丽贝卡了！请不要杀我！"

Shinji continued taking steps forward until he was standing directly in front of this disgusting human being. If he was still in his right mind, this would have looked oddly familiar.  
真嗣继续向前迈步，直到他直接站在了这个令人作呕的人面前。如果他还神志清醒，这一幕看起来会异常熟悉。

"You want me to forgive you?" he asked still not showing any emotions. "You sure? I think that the world would be better off without people like you actually," said Shinji, mimicking what Eein had said moments ago.  
"你想让我原谅你吗？" 他问道，依旧面无表情。"你确定吗？我觉得这个世界没有像你这样的人会更好，" 真嗣模仿着艾因刚才说的话。

"I'm sorry! I'm Sorry!" he shrieked.  
"对不起！对不起！" 他尖叫道。

Shinji's gaze, which had seemed completely expressionless softened slightly as he watched this pitiful excuse of a human groveling in front of him.  
真嗣那原本看似毫无表情的目光，在看到这个可怜的人在他面前卑躬屈膝时，稍微柔和了一些。

'This isn't right,' a corner of his mind said to him, 'I promised not only myself, but Asuka that I would never use my AT-field against another human being...and yet look at me right now.'  
“这不对劲，”他脑海的一角对他说，“我不仅对自己，也对明日香承诺过，绝不会用我的 AT 力场对付另一个人类……可现在看看我自己在做什么。”

'Who cares,' said another voice in his mind, 'he deserves it. Paint the walls and floor of this place red in his blood.'  
“谁在乎呢，”他心中另一个声音说，“他活该。让这个地方的墙壁和地板都染上他的血。”

'No...I won't,' thought Shinji a little more forcefully.  
“不……我不会这么做，”真嗣更加坚定地想。

'Do it! He would have killed you! Every human being is scum! Every human deserves to be ground into the dirt from which they came out of! The Tree of Life shall regrow and Earth shall be rebuilt!'  
'动手吧！他会杀了你的！每个人类都是渣滓！每个人都该被碾回他们出生的尘土中去！生命之树将会重生，地球也将重建！'

'Enough!' thought Shinji silencing the other voice.  
'够了！' 真嗣心中默念，压制住了另一个声音。

Almost as though he had just opened his eyes after sleeping for the past few minutes, Shinji regained control over his self. He looked around at the three bodies lying unconscious on the floor and then at Eein who was leaning against the wooden counter.  
仿佛刚刚从几分钟的沉睡中睁开眼，真嗣重新掌控了自己。他环顾四周，看着躺在地上的三具不省人事的身体，然后转向倚靠在木制柜台上的 Eein。

"I won't forgive you and you _don't_ deserve to live...in fact I think you know that. But I can't kill you. You're pitiful and a lousy excuse of a human. Go crawl back to your father, and don't let me hear of you hanging around here anymore. Consider yourself lucky...a few more seconds and I would have killed you. Now get out of here!"  
"我不会原谅你，你也不配活着……事实上，我想你也明白这一点。但我不能杀你。你可怜兮兮的，根本不配做人。滚回你父亲那里去，别再让我听到你在这附近晃荡。算你走运……再过几秒，我就会杀了你。现在滚出去！"

Without needing anything further to persuade him, Eein pushed himself off the floor and scrambled to the door, slipping on the floor that was largely red from Shinji's own blood, before he opened the door and closed it with a bang.  
无需更多劝说，Eein 从地板上挣扎起身，踉跄着向门口跑去，地板上大片红色来自 Shinji 的鲜血让他滑了一下，随后他猛地打开门，砰的一声关上。

As he left, the built of tension still remaining in Shinji seemed to evaporate out of him. Looking down at the three unconscious bodies around him, he decided that at most he should get them out of the cafe. Using both his AT-field, and his own strength, he managed to haul the three of them into a pile around the side of the cafe where an alley ran in between the two roads. Walking back into the shop, he wasn't entirely surprised to see that Rebecca was still in the place Gonzo had left her. She seemed too shocked to speak right now.  
他离开后，Shinji 体内残留的紧张感似乎也随之消散。低头看着身边三个昏迷不醒的人，他决定最多就是把他们移出咖啡馆。他利用 AT 力场和自己的力量，设法将三人拖到咖啡馆旁的小巷里堆在一起。走回店内，看到 Rebecca 仍被留在 Gonzo 离开她的地方，他并不感到意外。她似乎震惊得说不出话来。

Stepping over the broken glass from the door frame that was created by the first bullet, Shinji walked around the side of the counter and was about to put an arm on Rebecca's shoulder when she seemed to collapse from shock. Reaching out for her shoulders, he managed to keep her upright and slowly she seemed to regain control of her feet. Looking around quickly, he found a wash cloth used to clean tables and ran some water over it from the sink before passing it to her.  
跨过被第一颗子弹击碎的门框玻璃碎片，真嗣绕到柜台侧面，正要伸手搭在丽贝卡的肩上，她却似乎因震惊而瘫软下来。他迅速伸出双手扶住她的肩膀，稳住了她，慢慢地，她似乎重新控制住了自己的双腿。他迅速环顾四周，找到一块用来清洁桌子的抹布，从水槽里沾了些水，递给了她。

"Here," he mumbled dejectedly, unsure how much longer he'd even be here before she started shrieking about what a freak he was.  
“给，”他沮丧地咕哝着，不确定自己还能在这里待多久，她会不会开始尖叫，说他是个怪胎。

However, she did no such thing.  
然而，她并没有那样做。

"Thank you," she said quietly as she took the wet cloth from him, running it over her face slowly. "But really this should be for you," she said as she turned towards him.  
"谢谢你，" 她轻声说道，从他手中接过湿布，缓缓地在脸上擦拭。"但这本该是给你的，" 她转向他说道。

Looking back at her, he asked without much hope in his heart, "Why?"  
他回头看着她，心中并无太多希望地问道："为什么？"

"That wound of yours...you should really go to the hospital. You were shot."  
"你那伤口……你真的应该去医院。你中枪了。"

"Its nothing," said Shinji hurriedly.  
“没什么，”真嗣急忙说道。

"Nothing! You're still losing blood! You're-"  
“没什么！你还在流血！你——”

She froze mid sentence though as she saw the strangest thing she'd ever see. Almost as though she was watching a movie in reverse, the blood flowing from the inch wide hole in Shinji's shoulder suddenly stopped. Next second her eyes widened, as the flesh around the wound started to swirl inward as if billions of cells were reconnecting the tissue at high speed. Eventually, the wound on Shinji's shoulder was completely sealed up, leaving it slightly raw as though he had just received an Indian burn somehow. That entire right side of his body, including his cloths, was still drenched in blood though.  
但她话说到一半突然僵住了，因为她看到了她这辈子见过的最奇怪的事情。仿佛在看一部倒放的电影，真嗣肩膀上那道一英寸宽的伤口流出的血突然停止了。下一秒，她的眼睛瞪大了，伤口周围的肉开始向内旋转，仿佛数十亿细胞以极快的速度重新连接组织。最终，真嗣肩膀上的伤口完全愈合了，只留下微微发红的痕迹，仿佛他不知怎么地刚被烫伤过。然而，他整个右半身，包括衣服，仍然浸满了血。

Shinji knew this would happen sooner or later, and he had rather wanted it to happen without Rebecca having to witness it, for certainly now, she thought he was freak.  
真嗣知道这迟早会发生，他更希望这不要让丽贝卡看到，因为现在她肯定觉得自己是个怪物。

"Shinji...you left some things out when you visited last time...didn't you?"  
"真嗣……你上次来访时隐瞒了一些事情，对吧？"

Shinji who had not expected this answer at all, took several seconds to turn to her. It was then that he saw his own reflection in the coffee pot just behind Rebecca, not realizing just how bad he looked. His eyes were of course still blood red, while he had blood splattered over most of his clothes and small streaks of it on his face  
真嗣完全没料到这个回答，愣了几秒钟才转向她。这时他才从丽贝卡身后咖啡壶的倒影中看到自己的模样，没意识到自己看起来有多糟糕。他的眼睛依旧是血红色的，衣服上溅满了血迹，脸上也有些许血痕。

"Thats...not the answer I expected to get," said Shinji in all honesty, still not really looking at her.  
“那……不是我预料中的答案，”真嗣坦诚地说，目光依旧没有真正落在她身上。

"Whats that supposed to mean?" asked Rebecca.  
“那是什么意思？”丽贝卡问道。

"Just that...you see what I am now."  
“只是……你现在看到了我的真实面貌。”

"What you are? Well I don't rightfully know that still. You're different than me certainly, in more ways than one. But does that matter...you've helped me twice now."  
"你到底是什么？老实说，我至今仍不清楚。你显然与我不同，各方面都是。但这重要吗...你已经帮了我两次。"

"Yeah but...weren't you afraid?" This was what he had been most worried.  
""是啊，但是...你不害怕吗？"" 这是他最担心的问题。

"Of course I was. Seeing you like that...it was like I was looking at a different person. What was that orange triangle thing that I saw?"  
"当然害怕。看到你那样...感觉就像面对一个完全不同的人。那个我看到的橙色三角形是什么？"

"That...its called an AT-field...and thats all I can tell you. You already know too much as it is."  
"那...它被称为 AT 力场...我能告诉你的就这么多。你已经知道得太多了。"

"Shinji...what happened to you? You seemed perfectly fine last time I saw you-"  
"真嗣...你发生了什么事？上次见你时你看起来完全没事——"

"Last time? Well things have happened since then I guess. But this...its been going on for a while, just...that its been getting stronger recently."  
"上次？嗯，自那以后发生了一些事情。但这个...已经持续一段时间了，只是...最近它变得更强烈了。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "I don't even know. There are a lot of theories as to why I have this...power. But I still don't know myself. And I hate it!"  
摇了摇头，真嗣说道：“我甚至不知道。关于我为什么拥有这种……力量，有很多理论。但我自己仍然不清楚。而且我讨厌它！”

"Well I can understand that but...I mean...you just helped me get rid of Eein for what looks like that last time. So it can't be all that-"  
“嗯，我能理解，但是……我的意思是……你刚刚帮我摆脱了艾因，看起来是最后一次了。所以它不可能那么糟糕——”

"Rebecca...I killed somebody with this power before." It was only then did Shinji finally look her in the eye, as though trying to get across how serious this was.  
“丽贝卡……我曾用这种力量杀过人。”直到这时，真嗣才终于直视她的眼睛，仿佛试图传达这件事的严重性。

"...Oh...what...happened?"  
"...哦...发生了...什么？"

"...Its...too painful. Even now I hate to think about it. Basically I lost control, because it was the first time I had gone into that state where I didn't think of anything except killing the person in front of me...because they harmed somebody dear to me. Usually its my anger that sets it off. The person was even more loathsome than Eein...but even so...I killed him with my own two hands."  
"...太痛苦了。即使现在我也不愿去回想。基本上是我失控了，因为那是第一次我进入那种状态，除了杀死眼前的人什么都不想...因为他们伤害了我珍视的人。通常是我的愤怒引发了这一切。那个人甚至比 Eein 更令人厌恶...但即便如此...我亲手杀了他。"

"Shinji...I-I'm sorry." "真嗣...我-我很抱歉。"

"Don't apologize. I've been dealing with this for a while now...and I promised that I wouldn't kill anybody with my AT-field ever again...it was only because of that promise that I didn't kill Eein."  
"别道歉。我已经处理这事儿有一阵子了……我承诺过再也不会用我的 AT 力场伤害任何人……正是因为这个承诺，我才没有对 Eein 下杀手。"

"So then...what Asuka asked you before...was she referring to this...AT-field of yours?"  
"那么……之前 Asuka 问你的事情……她指的是你的这个……AT 力场吗？"

"When we were here last time? Yeah, she was afraid that I had used it against Eein and Gon...wait...you remember Asuka?"  
"上次我们在这里的时候？是的，她担心我对 Eein 和 Gon 使用了它……等等……你记得 Asuka？"

Rebecca blinked back at him, thinking that she had misheard the question.  
丽贝卡眨眼回望着他，心想自己是不是听错了问题。

"Why wouldn't I remember her?" asked Rebecca skeptically. "I'd be hard pressed to forget the annoyed looks she was sending me."  
“我怎么会不记得她？”丽贝卡怀疑地问道，“我很难忘记她那时对我投来的恼怒眼神。”

"...I know. But wait, no! How are you able to remember her?"  
“……我知道。但等等，不！你怎么能记得她？”

"What do you mean? ...Did something happen between you?"  
"你这是什么意思？...你们之间发生了什么吗？"

Shinji opened his mouth as though he was going to say, 'no,' but instead closed it and turned away from her. Eventually he started very quietly.  
真嗣张开嘴，似乎要说‘没有’，但随即又闭上了，转过身去。最终，他非常轻声地开口了。

"It happened a few days ago...another angel showed up and Asuka...her mind was damaged, her memories of me to be precise. She no longer remembers who I am."  
"那是几天前的事了...又一个使徒出现了，而明日香...她的心智受到了损伤，确切地说，是我的记忆。她不再记得我是谁了。"

Even though he had promised himself that he wouldn't cry over this, speaking it out loud for the first time made him seize up for a second.  
尽管他曾向自己保证过不会为此流泪，但第一次大声说出来时，他还是愣了一会儿。

"Shinji...I...Oh my God...isn't there a way to...fix them...or...for her to regain them."  
“真嗣...我...哦天哪...难道没有方法...修复它们...或者...让她恢复吗。”

"There is but...its too dangerous, and if it fails her mind would be broken permanently."  
“有是有...但...太危险了，如果失败，她的心智将永久受损。”

"Shinji...are you-" "真嗣...你还好吗？"

"I'm fine," he said a little too forcefully. Though seeing that hurt look on her face he sighed and said, "I'm dealing with it okay. But every things...just been happening so quickly. First the fourth shows up, and then Asuka just...disappears from my life."  
"我没事，" 他有些过于用力地说道。尽管看到她脸上受伤的表情，他叹了口气，说："我能应付得来。但一切...都发生得太快了。先是第四适格者出现，然后明日香就...从我的生活中消失了。"

"The fourth?" "第四适格者？"

"...Never mind. But anyway, why are you able to remember Asuka, but a bunch of kids at my school aren't able to remember me?"  
"...没关系。但话说回来，为什么你能记得明日香，而我学校的一群孩子却记不得我呢？"

"Why don't they remember you?"  
"他们为什么记不得你？"

"Because I met them through Asu-"  
"因为我通过明日香认识他们的——"

'Wait,' he suddenly thought, cutting himself off mid sentence. 'I met Touji, Kensuke, and Hikari through Asuka essentially. If Asuka had never been there, I never would have gotten to know them, because I had never talked to them before. But then what about Rebecca? I introduced Rebecca to Asuka and vice versa...so then...what? Because my memories of Asuka still exist...Rebecca still remembers her?  
"“等等，”他突然想到，打断了自己的话。“我是通过明日香才认识东治、真希波和光。如果明日香从未出现，我也不会认识他们，因为我之前从未和他们交谈过。但丽贝卡呢？是我把丽贝卡介绍给明日香，反之亦然……那么……这意味着什么？因为我的记忆中仍有明日香的存在……丽贝卡还记得她吗？”

"Rebecca...how well do you remember Asuka?"  
"“丽贝卡……你还记得明日香多少？”

"...I don't under-" "“……我不明白-”

"Clearly, how clearly do you remember her. Features, personality, anythi-"  
"显然，你对她记得有多清楚？外貌、性格，任何事——"

"Yes, I remember her very clearly, even though it was the first time I'd met her."  
"是的，我记得她非常清楚，尽管那是我们第一次见面。"

"So you could pick her out in a crowd based solely on how she looks."  
"所以你仅凭她的外貌就能在人群中认出她。"

"Easily...and she doesn't look Japanese at all in the first place."  
"很容易...而且她一开始看起来就完全不像日本人。"

"True," mumbled Shinji. "确实，" 真嗣咕哝道。"

"Why do you seem so anxious though?"  
"不过，你为什么显得这么焦虑呢？"

"What? Oh nothing...never mind," said Shinji not entirely truthful.  
"什么？哦，没什么...别在意，" 真嗣说得不完全诚实。

"Shinji...have you seen her at all yet...or talked with her?"  
"真嗣...你有没有见过她...或者和她说过话？"

"No...and I don't intend to unless its part of working as an Eva pilot."  
"没有...而且我也不打算这么做，除非是作为 Eva 驾驶员的工作需要。"

"What? Why? You could rebuild the relationship you had before."  
"什么？为什么？你可以重建你们之前的关系。"

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "It doesn't work like that. If I were to try and rebuild my relationship with Asuka, and she remembered everything in the process, it'd be possible that her mind would break...permanently."  
摇了摇头，真嗣说：“事情不是那样的。如果我试图重建与明日香的关系，而她在过程中记起了一切，她的心智可能会永久崩溃。”

"But doing this! Doing absolutely nothing about this and acting as though its fine! Isn't that even worse!"  
"但这样做！对这一切完全不采取任何措施，还装作没事一样！这不是更糟糕吗！"

"I don't care...if she's alive and fine then I can live with simply the memories that I have."  
"我不在乎...如果她还活着并且安好，那么我拥有的这些记忆就足够让我活下去了。"

"But they're simply memories, and not a reality!"  
"但那些只是记忆，并非现实！"

"But I can still remember...and thats enough for me."  
"但我依然能记得...这就足够了。"

"You don't believe that do you?"  
"你不会真的相信吧？"

It took Shinji a few moments to reply, but when he did, she only caught every other word, "I can't afford to _not_ believe that. Because if I don't...I'll end up hurting her."  
真嗣过了好一会儿才回答，但当他说话时，她只听清了隔一个字的内容，“我不能不相信。因为如果我不信……我会伤害到她。”

"But you haven't even tried!"  
"但你甚至还没尝试过！"

Shrugging, Shinji mumbled, "No, I haven't...but even if I did it wouldn't make a difference."  
耸了耸肩，真嗣咕哝道：“不，我没有……但即使我做了，也不会有什么改变。”

Turning away from her, he walked around the side of the counter and started walking towards the door when she shouted, "You're just running away from it all! Can't you see that!"  
他转身背对她，绕过柜台一侧，开始向门口走去，这时她大喊道：“你只是在逃避这一切！难道你看不出来吗！”

Shinji seemed to pause for a second and flinch at her words, so like that of his father and for a moment Rebecca thought that he would yell at her, when instead he turned his head towards her and said, "I'm running away for her sake...so its fine. And I probably won't see you again after this, unless its in the sea of LCL fluid. If you'll take my advice, you'll move out of Tokyo-3 and find somebody that cares for you. Goodbye Rebecca.  
"真嗣似乎顿了一下，听到她的话时微微一颤，那语气与他父亲如出一辙。有那么一刻，丽贝卡以为他会朝她大吼，但他却转过头来，对她说：“我逃跑是为了她……所以没关系。而且，我可能再也不会见到你了，除非是在 LCL 之海中。如果你愿意听我的建议，就离开第三新东京市，去找一个真正关心你的人。再见，丽贝卡。”

Shinji turned and grabbed the door nob, ignoring the pane of glass that still hung in the frame, and walked out in the open sun, leaving Rebecca still standing behind the counter.  
真嗣转身抓住门把手，无视那块仍挂在窗框上的玻璃，走进了开阔的阳光下，留下丽贝卡依旧站在柜台后。

"'Find somebody that cares for you,'" she mouthed. "As if anybody could care for me as you did."  
“‘找到一个关心你的人。’”她无声地说道。“仿佛有人能像你那样关心我。”

Finally, a single tear streamed down her face.  
终于，一滴泪珠顺着她的脸颊滑落。

---

Shinji flipped open the cell phone, when he remembered that somebody had tried to call him before he had entered the cafe and everything else had been blown apart. Two missed calls and a voicemail were waiting for him, both of them from a phone line that he guessed was a Nerv number. Navigating to his voicemail, he pressed the select button and held the phone up to his ear as he listened to the voicemail.  
真嗣打开手机，这时他想起在他进入咖啡馆并发生爆炸之前，有人试图给他打电话。有两个未接来电和一个语音留言在等着他，都是来自一个他猜测是 NERV 的号码。他导航到语音信箱，按下选择键，将手机举到耳边，听着留言。

After a moments pause of nothing but silence as though the speaker was unsure whether what they were doing was wise or not, a female voice came on the phone.  
片刻的沉默后，仿佛说话者不确定自己这样做是否明智，一个女性的声音从电话中传来。

"Hey Shinji...its Misato. I guess you left a while ago, because I went to Unit 02's chamber earlier but you had already left. I'd heard that you met the fourth, Nagisa Kaoru I should say, earlier and learned that he would be taking his synchronization test today. He seemed to wish you had been there to watch."  
“嘿，真嗣……是我，美里。我想你已经离开一段时间了，因为我之前去了 02 号机的机舱，但你已经走了。我听说你之前遇到了第四适格者，应该说是渚薰，并且得知他今天会进行同步测试。他似乎希望你能在那里观看。”

Removing the phone from his ear, Shinji looked down at it while Misato kept talking away about stuff he didn't really care about.  
从耳边移开手机，真嗣低头看着它，而美里还在滔滔不绝地说着他并不真正关心的事情。

"Call me when you actually have something to say," murmured Shinji as he made to close the phone.  
“有话要说的时候再打给我，”真嗣低声说着，准备合上手机。

"Asuka woke up...Shinji."  
“明日香醒了……真嗣。”

Shinji paused as he was half way through closing the phone, and did a double take. He didn't hear anything for a long time though and thought that Misato had hung up before he heard several quite words.  
真嗣在合上手机的途中突然停了下来，又仔细看了看。虽然他很久都没听到任何声音，以为美里已经挂断了，但随后听到了几个低沉的字眼。

"Just thought you should know."  
“只是觉得你应该知道。”

A quick click followed shortly after ending the voicemail. The operator started asking the usual questions of saving the voicemail or replaying while Shinji continued looking down at the phone, replaying Misato's last words in his own head. Eventually he closed the phone and put it back in his pocket.  
语音信箱结束后不久，传来了一声快速的点击声。接线员开始询问是否保存或重放语音信箱，而真嗣继续低头看着手机，在脑海中反复回放美里最后的话。最终，他合上手机，放回了口袋。

"Thanks Misato," he whispered, before he continued walking down the sidewalk, and back to his cold hard bed waiting for him at Nerv.  
"谢谢美里。" 他低声说道，继续沿着人行道走去，回到 NERV 里那张冰冷坚硬的床上，正等着他。

---

"Dear God its good to be back," jeered Asuka as she threw open the door to Misato's apartment and seemed to parade in.  
"天哪，回来真好，" 明日香嘲讽地说着，猛地推开美里公寓的门，仿佛在炫耀般走了进去。

"Glad you seem so excited," laughed Misato as she walked in behind Asuka, carrying the nights meal with her. She now wondered how she was going to live without Shinji's cooking, but rebuked herself for how selfish she was being.  
"很高兴你看起来这么兴奋，" 美里笑着跟在明日香后面走进来，手里提着晚餐。她现在开始思考没有真嗣的烹饪她该如何生活，但又责备自己太过自私。

"After being stuck in that room for three days, even if I can't remember any of it, it just feels good to be back here. Hey can I take a shower first? Ritsuko wouldn't let me for some reason."  
"在那房间里被困了三天后，即使我一点儿也记不起来，能回到这里感觉真好。嘿，我能先洗个澡吗？丽素不知为何不让我洗。"

"Go ahead," said Misato as she took of her shoes, "you remember where it is right?"  
"去吧，"" 美里边脱鞋边说，""你知道在哪儿对吧？"

"Of course," replied Asuka, looking at Misato rather shrewdly.  
"当然，"" 明日香回答道，目光锐利地看着美里。"

Half an hour later, Asuka walked into the kitchen, drying off her hair with a red towel, effectively matching her fiery hair. She had thrown on a loose, bright yellow tang top and low cut pair of shorts giving every inclination that she didn't care how she looked once she was inside the apartment. Misato was at the table, wearing something similar, and drinking a can of beer, having already finished her dinner.  
半小时后，明日香走进厨房，用一条红色毛巾擦干头发，与她火红的头发相得益彰。她随意地套上了一件明黄色的唐装上衣和一条低腰短裤，明显表示一旦进入公寓，她就不在乎自己的外表了。美里坐在桌旁，穿着类似的休闲装，正喝着一罐啤酒，晚餐已经吃完了。

"Phew...now I feel more like myself," sighed Asuka as she sat down in a chair across from Misato. Looking at the fast food that Misato had just gone through, she scrunched up her face in disgust.  
“呼……现在我感觉更像自己了。”明日香叹了口气，坐在美里对面的椅子上。看着美里刚吃完的快餐，她厌恶地皱起了脸。

"I had forgotten that you can't cook anything," said Asuka.  
“我忘了你什么都不会做，”明日香说。

"Don't remind me," replied Misato as she took another sip of beer, "And its not as bad as it could have been."  
"别提醒我，" 美里回答着又喝了一口啤酒，"而且也没糟糕到无法忍受的地步。"

"...What is it exactly?" "...这到底是什么？"

"No clue...yours is sitting in the microwave waiting for you to reheat it."  
"不知道...你的那份在微波炉里，等着你加热呢。"

"Thanks," scoffed Asuka not really meaning it.  
“谢谢，”明日香嗤之以鼻，并非真心实意。

Misato frowned at her, forgetting how much of a change had happened to her when Shinji entered her life.  
美里皱眉看着她，忘记了自从真嗣进入她的生活后，她发生了多大的变化。

Standing up, Asuka walked over to the microwave and punched in some numbers, warming it up quickly, all the time muttering how this was little better than Nerv's food.  
明日香站起身，走到微波炉前，迅速输入几个数字加热，一边嘀咕着这比 NERV 的食物好不了多少。

'If you don't like it, why don't you cook,' thought Misato. 'Its not like you can't.'  
“如果你不喜欢，为什么不自己动手做呢，”Misato 心想，“又不是不会。”

As Asuka sat down back at the table, Misato finally decided to ask, "How do you feel?"  
当 Asuka 回到桌前坐下时，Misato 终于决定问她：“你感觉怎么样？”

Asuka, who was just about to take her first bite of the lackluster meal, paused and looked up at Misato. Looking back down at her food, she pushed it away from her, suddenly feeling her appetite slip away. Shifting rather uncomfortably now from one side of the chair to the other, she finally said, "I don't...really know. Its a lot to take in all at once...and I don't quite understand the whole memory thing...I mean," she swallowed. "Why did the angel search my memories in the first place...it had to be looking for something, right?"  
Asuka 正要吃第一口这乏味的饭菜，停了下来，抬头看着 Misato。她低头看着食物，把它推开，突然间食欲全无。她不安地在椅子上左右挪动，最后说道：“我不……真的不知道。这一切来得太突然……而且我还不完全明白记忆的事情……我是说，”她咽了咽口水。“那个使徒为什么要搜索我的记忆……它肯定是在找什么东西，对吧？”

"Thats what we guessed," said Misato, "but we don't haven any idea what it was looking for," she finished. However, this was a downright lie. Ritsuko had very expressly told her that the angel was searching for anything relating to Shinji, and Asuka seemed to be the person that knew him the best. Or did, at least.  
“我们也是这么猜的，”美里说，“但我们完全不知道它在找什么。”她最后说道。然而，这完全是一句谎话。律子非常明确地告诉过她，天使在寻找与真嗣有关的任何东西，而明日香似乎是最了解他的人。至少曾经是。

"And things are still...entire blanks. Its like...I can remember myself doing things...and some of it makes sense...but other times its like as though somebody was missing. I asked Ritsuko about these lapses in my memory, but she didn't really say anything. I feel like...there is too much gone, like something was cut out."  
“而且事情仍然是……完全空白。就好像……我能记得自己做过的事情……有些部分说得通……但其他时候就像少了个人似的。我问过律子关于我记忆中的这些空白，但她什么都没说。我感觉……好像缺失了太多，就像有什么被切掉了。”

Misato looked back at her for a moment, surprised at Asuka's deductive reasoning. Well, she had always been exceptionally smart, so this was somewhat expected.  
美里回头看了她一会儿，对明日香的推理能力感到惊讶。嗯，她一直都非常聪明，所以这也在意料之中。

"I can't explain it any better than Ritsuko can...probably worse for that matter. Memory of course is stored in the brain, and even with all our technological advances in the twenty-first century, we still don't fully understand how the brain works. Maybe everything will just come back to you," said Misato.  
"我无法比律子解释得更好...可能还更糟。记忆当然存储在大脑中，尽管我们在二十一世纪取得了所有科技进步，我们仍然不完全理解大脑是如何工作的。也许一切都会自然而然地回到你的记忆中，"美里说道。

"Yeah...maybe," said Asuka rather glumly, not at all in the mood to eat now.  
"是啊...也许吧，"明日香相当沮丧地说，现在一点胃口都没有了。

"Well you're alive and well, and you survived a traumatizing experience, so we can be thankful for that. I was worried about you Asuka."  
"好吧，你还活着，而且安然无恙，你经历了一场创伤性的经历却幸存了下来，所以我们应该为此感到庆幸。我真的很担心你，明日香。"

"...Thanks...I know I don't say that often, but when Ritsuko told me..."  
"...谢谢...我知道我不常说这个，但当律子告诉我..."

"I understand, and you should probably get some rest. Ritsuko wants to do another physical examination on you tomorrow and she doesn't want you moving around too much today."  
"我明白，你或许应该休息一下。律子明天想再给你做一次体检，她不希望你今天活动太多。"

"Mmm...okay. I'm still a little groggy I guess."  
"嗯...好的。我想我还是有点迷糊。"

Standing up and completely ignoring the food that was still sitting on the kitchen table she turned towards her room and started walking towards it.  
她站起身来，完全无视了厨房桌上还摆着的饭菜，转身朝自己的房间走去。

'Why do I feel like Misato wasn't entirely truthful about my memories?' thought Asuka. 'I can understand the brain thing, having taken a class on the study and functions of the brain, but...I don't know, I just feel like she left something out. Eh, whatever, I'm sure I'm just over thinking thi-'  
'为什么我觉得美里对我记忆的解释并不完全真实呢？'明日香心想。'我能理解大脑的事情，毕竟我上过关于大脑研究和功能的课程，但是...我就是觉得她隐瞒了什么。唉，算了，我肯定只是想太多了——'

Asuka had thrown open the door to her room only to find it completely empty. After a moments pause, Asuka opened her mouth and...  
明日香猛地推开自己房间的门，却发现里面空空如也。她愣了一会儿，然后张开了嘴……

"THE FUCK! WHERE IS ALL MY STUFF!  
"搞什么鬼！我的东西都去哪儿了！

From the kitchen could be heard the sound of Misato spilling her beer and a string of cuss words at Asuka's sudden outburst which surprised her.  
厨房里传来美里打翻啤酒和一连串咒骂的声音，明日香突然的爆发让她吓了一跳。

"Asuka what are you-" “明日香，你在干什么——”

"WHY IS THERE NOTHING IN HERE! WAS I EXPECTED TO DIE OR-"  
"为什么这里什么都没有！难道我应该死掉还是——"

"Asuka thats the spare room, you're room is next to that one!" yelled Misato.  
“明日香，那是备用房间，你的房间在隔壁！”美里大声喊道。

It took Misato's words a few seconds to sink in until Asuka opened her mouth in a comical, 'O.' Turning back to the empty room, she looked it over and realized that it was slightly smaller than her own room.  
美里的话过了几秒钟才渗入明日香的意识，她张开嘴，做出一个滑稽的‘O’形。转身回到空荡荡的房间，她环视四周，意识到这个房间比她自己的要稍微小一些。

'How did I mistake this for my own room, and why did I go here in the first place?'  
“我怎么会把这个房间误认为是我的，而且一开始为什么会来这里？”

Sticking her head back into the hallways, she shouted towards Misato, "Has this room always been empty!"  
她把头探回走廊，朝着美里喊道：“这房间一直空着吗？”

"Of course...why?" “当然……为什么这么问？”

"No...I was just thinking, why I never used it to store my stuff that couldn't fit in my first room. Is it alright if I use it for that?"  
“不……我只是想，为什么我以前没用它来存放那些放不进第一个房间的东西。我可以用来放那些东西吗？”

Shrugging, Misato said, "Go ahead, nobody else is going to use it."  
米萨托耸耸肩，说：“去吧，反正也没人会用它。”

"Good, because I don't like half my things sitting in the Nerv storage."  
“太好了，因为我可不喜欢我的东西一半都放在 NERV 的仓库里。”

As Asuka walked back into the empty room, she didn't see the forlorn look that seemed to pass over Misato's face.  
当明日香走回空荡荡的房间时，她没有注意到米萨托脸上掠过的那抹忧郁神情。

'Yeah, this should be enough room to store everything else I own, since it is only boxes,' thought Asuka back inside the room as she took another look around. 'But why...I don't ever remember being in here before, yet Misato said its been empty this entire time.'  
“嗯，这里应该足够存放我其他所有的东西了，毕竟只有一些箱子，”明日香回到房间里再次环顾四周时心想，“但为什么……我从不记得以前来过这里，可美里却说它一直空着。”

Suddenly, and at this very thought, her mind was hit by such a severe headache that at first she thought something had ruptured inside her brain.  
突然，就在这个念头闪过时，她的脑袋受到了如此剧烈的头痛冲击，以至于她起初以为自己的大脑里有什么东西破裂了。

'No...I've been in here before...but...I can't remember. Why can't I remember? I feel as though I should...'  
“不……我以前来过这里……但是……我想不起来。为什么我想不起来？我感觉我应该记得……”

"Asuka? You okay in there?"  
"明日香？你在里面还好吗？"

"Fine," Asuka heard herself reply, but in truth she wasn't sure if she was fine. This room bothered her for some reason, and she didn't like how she felt standing there.  
"还好，" 明日香听到自己回答，但实际上她不确定自己是否真的还好。这个房间不知为何让她感到不安，她不喜欢站在那里的感觉。

'Maybe I wont keep my stuff in here,' she thought as she turned around and left Shinji's room.  
“也许我不该把东西放在这里，”她想着，转身离开了真嗣的房间。

After closing the door to the empty room, she looked across the hallway at Misato and saw that she was watching her intently. Frowning slightly, she brushed off her miss givings and turned towards her own room. However, she paused as she remembered something.  
关上空房间的门后，她隔着走廊望向美里，发现她正专注地盯着自己。她微微皱眉，拂去心中的疑虑，转身朝自己的房间走去。然而，她突然停下，想起了什么。

"Misato...has the third child arrived yet?"  
“美里……第三个孩子到了吗？”

Asuka could have asked anything relating to Shinji, but in Misato's eyes, she couldn't have asked something so hurtful. It showed just how far apart Shinji and Asuka were.  
明日香本可以问任何与真嗣相关的问题，但在美里看来，她问不出如此伤人的话。这恰恰显示了真嗣和明日香之间有多么疏远。

Trying to keep the trembling and hesitancy in her voice to a bear minimum, Misato said, "Yes...both him and the fourth arrived while you were unconscious."  
试图将声音中的颤抖和犹豫降到最低，美里说：“是的...他和第四适格者在你昏迷期间到达了。”

"Both of them...at the same time?"  
“他们两个...同时？”

"It was rather...unexpected. The fourth actually started at your school a few days ago."  
“这相当...出乎意料。第四适格者实际上几天前就开始在你的学校就读了。”

"...What about the third?"  
"...那第三个呢？"

"He's...staying at Nerv for certain reason."  
"他...因为某些原因留在 NERV。"

"Hmph...sounds like another pet to me. So what are their names?"  
"哼...听起来像又是一个宠物。那么他们叫什么名字？"

Misato blinked several times in response to Asuka's question.  
美里对明日香的问题眨了几次眼。

"What? I'm sorry I didn't quite catch that."  
“什么？抱歉，我没太听清楚。”

"Their names, what are their names," repeated Asuka, looking a little annoyed now.  
“他们的名字，他们的名字是什么，”明日香重复道，现在看起来有点不耐烦了。

Misato paused for a second, trying to determine how much damage she would do if she said Shinji's name, when she decided on-  
美里顿了一下，试图判断如果她提到真嗣的名字会造成多少伤害，然后她决定——

"You'll see them tomorrow no doubt. You can ask them yourself."  
“你明天无疑会见到他们的。你可以亲自问他们。”

Asuka looked at her evenly for a second, before she nodded and said, "Okay...well I suppose I'll go to sleep. Thanks for letting me use the extra room again."  
明日香平静地看了她一秒钟，然后点点头说：“好吧……我想我会去睡觉。谢谢你再次让我使用备用房间。”

"No problem," mumbled Misato as she looked down at the table, anticipating for when Asuka went into her own room, and sure enough, the moment Asuka's door closed, Misato brought her head down on the wooden table and banged it lightly against it.  
“没问题，”美里咕哝着，低头看着桌子，期待着明日香进她自己的房间，果然，明日香一关门，美里就把头靠在木桌上，轻轻地敲了敲。

'Damn it,' she thought silently with her head still pressed against the table. 'I knew that living with her would be challenging...but...I hate lying to her like this.'  
“该死，”她头还贴着桌子，默默地想，“我知道和她一起住会有挑战……但是……我讨厌这样对她撒谎。”

Bringing her head off the table, she drained what remained of her beer and leaned back in the chair she was sitting in.  
她把头从桌上抬起，喝光剩下的啤酒，然后靠在她坐的椅子上。

'What was it that Ritsuko said?' she wondered. 'The body may remember it, but the mind wont? Is it possible that...no, I'm probably over thinking this. But I do need another beer now...'  
“理津子说了什么来着？”她思索着，“身体或许记得，但心却不会？难道说……不，我可能想太多了。不过我现在确实需要再来一瓶啤酒……”

---

Asuka had her back pressed against her door, listening for any sounds coming from the kitchen. She did hear some light thumping sounds, and then it seemed that Misato left her chair and grabbed something out of the fridge.  
明日香背靠着门，聆听着厨房传来的任何声响。她确实听到了一些轻微的撞击声，随后似乎美里离开了椅子，从冰箱里拿了什么东西。

'Probably another beer,' thought Asuka. 'But what was up with her? She was so...evasive about the third and fourth child. Why though? Unless it has something to do with my memory loss. But no, thats impossible. They were just found two days ago so theres no way they'd have anything to do with...whatever happened to me.'  
“估计又是啤酒吧，”明日香心想，“但她到底怎么了？她对第三和第四适格者的事情那么……闪烁其词。为什么呢？除非这与我的记忆丧失有关。但不可能，他们两天前才被找到，所以不可能与……发生在我身上的事有关。”

'But the third child was supposed to be found around the time you arrived in Tokyo-3,' said a small voice in her head.  
“但第三个孩子应该在你到达第三新东京市时就被找到的，”她脑海中有个细小的声音说道。

'Well, yes but, it could have always taken them longer to find him then initially intended,' she replied.  
“嗯，是的，不过，他们可能原本就打算花更长时间来找到他，”她回答道。

As to that, the voice in her head didn't have anything to reply.  
对此，她脑海中的声音无言以对。

'Well whatever, I'm sure I'm just being paranoid anyway.'  
'哎，管它呢，反正我觉得自己只是有点多疑罢了。'

Walking over to her futon, she flopped down on it and buried her hair, still slightly damp from her earlier shower, into her pillow. Nothing felt as good as returning home to your own bed.  
她走到自己的蒲团旁，扑通一声坐下，将刚洗完澡还有些湿润的头发埋进枕头里。没有什么比回到家躺在自己的床上更舒服的了。

'Much better,' she sighed into the pillow, relishing how soft it was against her cheek. Even if she didn't want to admit it, Misato's apartment had fast become a place where she considered home, more so than any other place before then for that matter. However, as memories of the Nerv facilities in Germany, and her own days downtrodden under her father hit her, she rolled to her right and thought, 'Those days are behind me, and I'm an Eva pilot now...the best for that matter. I shouldn't be worried about those things.' But no matter what, they would still hang over her head.  
'好多了，'她叹息着把脸埋在枕头里，享受着枕头柔软的触感。尽管她不愿承认，美里小姐的公寓已经迅速成为她心中的家，比以往任何地方都更让她有归属感。然而，当德国 NERV 设施的记忆和她父亲统治下的阴暗日子涌上心头时，她向右翻了个身，心想：'那些日子已经过去了，我现在是 EVA 驾驶员了……而且是最优秀的。我不该为那些事担心。'但无论如何，那些阴影仍会笼罩在她心头。

Suddenly yawning widely, she mumbled, "Maybe I should get some sleep, I guess I've still not fully recuperated since I woke up only a few hours ago."  
突然打了个大大的哈欠，她咕哝道：“也许我该去睡一会儿，我想自从我醒来才几个小时，还没完全恢复过来。”

Pushing her head into a more comfortable position against the pillow, she closed her eyes slowly as her last vision was that of the nightstand next to her bed with the lamp on it and-  
她把头挪到一个更舒服的位置，靠在枕头上，慢慢地闭上了眼睛，她最后看到的景象是床头柜上的台灯，以及——

'What was that?' she thought as her eyes flew back open and fixed themselves on an object resting on the nightstand next to her bed within reaching distance of her arm. It was almost as though it had been placed there on purpose, so that it was easily reachable.  
“那是什么？”她心想，眼睛猛地睁开，目光锁定在床头柜上，一个物体正躺在她伸手可及的地方。仿佛是故意放在那里，以便她能轻易拿到。

As she reached for the small square box, she thought, 'Did I have something like this? I can't remember ever seeing it before.'  
当她伸手去拿那个小巧的方形盒子时，心里想着，‘我有过这样的东西吗？我记不清以前见过它。’

Rolling over onto her back, she held the small box covered with purple velvet above her.  
她翻身仰躺，将那个紫色天鹅绒包裹的小盒子举在上方。

'Is this...mine? But its...'  
‘这是...我的吗？但它...’

She trailed off here and decided to just open it.  
她说到这里顿了顿，决定直接打开它。

Bringing it closer to eye level, she snapped open the small box and pulled the hinge back all the way.  
她将盒子举到眼前，啪地一声打开小盒子，将铰链完全拉开。

"Wha..." “什...”

Starring back at her, were the two golden dolphins earrings with the ocean colored eyes that Shinji had gotten for her at the souvenir shop.  
回望着她的，是那对金色海豚耳环，拥有海洋般色彩的眼睛，这是真嗣在纪念品店为她挑选的。

"What...this is..." “这...这是...”

Reaching into the box, she slowly drew the earrings out and setting the box besides her, held them in the palm of her hands.  
她伸手进盒子里，缓缓取出耳环，将盒子放在一旁，双手捧着它们。

"This...is mine? But where...did I get them?"  
“这些...是我的？但我...从哪儿得到的？”

As she continued looking at them though, two things happened. First: a wide range of emotions hit her. Feelings that she had never expected to know suddenly coursed through her. Longing, sadness, happiness; things that she had never felt before, and it was...pleasant?  
然而，当她继续凝视它们时，发生了两件事。首先：一股强烈的情感涌上心头。那些她从未预料会体验到的情感突然涌动，渴望、悲伤、快乐；这些她从未感受过的情绪，竟然...令人愉悦？

Second, however, a splitting headache, far worse than the one a little while ago seared her forehead and she had to bite down on her tongue so that she didn't scream. Though, just as suddenly as it appeared, it disappeared.  
然而，第二件事是，一阵剧烈的头痛袭来，远比不久前的那次更甚，灼烧着她的额头，她不得不咬紧舌头以免尖叫出声。不过，就像它突然出现一样，它又突然消失了。

'Why? Why do I feel this...over these...but I don't even know...'  
'为什么？为什么我对这些...会有这种...但我甚至都不了解...'

As she continued looking at them however, she felt something streak down the side of her face.  
然而，当她继续凝视着它们时，她感到有什么东西顺着脸颊滑落。

"..."

Pressing the hand not holding the earrings to the side of her face, she drew it back only to see something sparkly shining on her hands.  
她用没有拿着耳环的那只手轻触脸颊，收回时只见手上闪烁着晶莹的光芒。

"Am I...crying?" "我...在哭吗？"

She was. Pearly white tears streaked down Asuka's face of which she had no control over, and the problem was, she didn't know where they originated from. Now, stronger than before, a feeling of longing swept over her so powerful that for a second she felt like the world had ended.  
她的确在哭。珍珠般的泪水不受控制地沿着明日香的脸颊滑落，而问题在于，她不知道这些泪水的源头。此刻，比之前更为强烈的渴望感席卷而来，如此强烈以至于有那么一瞬间，她感觉世界仿佛已经终结。

'What is this?' she wondered, with tears still streaking down her face, before pausing at her chin and falling onto her chest. 'Why am I crying? I don't even know where these came from. But...I feel sad. Why? I don't understand. I-'  
'这是怎么回事？'她思索着，泪水依旧顺着脸颊流至下巴，然后滴落在胸前。'我为什么要哭？我甚至不知道这些泪水从何而来。但是...我感到悲伤。为什么？我不明白。我-'

But they meant a lot to her, that much she couldn't ignore. She couldn't throw them away, even if she tried. They felt almost like-  
但这些对她意义重大，她无法忽视这一点。即使她试图丢弃，也无法做到。它们几乎就像是——

'A memory?' she thought. 'Is this...something that has to do with my lost memories?'  
'一段记忆？' 她心想。'这是否...与我的失忆有关？'

As she thought this, almost unbidden, came into her mind an ocean with a large beach in front and a setting sun behind everything. No matter who Asuka was right then, these simple objects clasped in her hand held such a special memory that blankness of mind, or time couldn't destroy it. Because the body remembered.  
当她这么想时，脑海中不由自主地浮现出一幅画面：面前是一片广阔的沙滩，背后是夕阳西下。无论当时的明日香是谁，手中紧握的这些简单物品承载着如此特别的记忆，心灵的空白或时间的流逝都无法摧毁它。因为身体记得。

Closing both her hands around the earring now, she pressed her clasped hands against her chest and thought, 'I don't know why...or even how...but these simple earrings mean more to me than anything else. And yet...they make me incredibly sad. Its weird...I hate feeling sad to the point I forced myself not to cry or feel remorse over anything. But this is different...its like a lost something precious to me that can't ever be replaced.'  
她双手合拢，紧紧握住那只耳环，贴在胸前，心中暗想：‘我不知道为什么……甚至不知道怎么……但这对简单的耳环对我来说比任何东西都重要。然而……它们却让我感到无比悲伤。这很奇怪……我讨厌悲伤到极点的感觉，以至于我强迫自己不去哭泣或感到悔恨。但这次不同……就像失去了某种珍贵的东西，永远无法替代。’

Closing her eyes, she tried to conjure up a mental image of how she would have gotten them. A dear friend maybe? An heirloom from her deceased mother? Well, that last part was rather unlikely. But...what about a boy?  
她闭上眼睛，试图在脑海中勾勒出自己可能如何得到它们的情景。是一位亲密的朋友吗？还是已故母亲留下的传家宝？嗯，最后一种可能性相当小。但是……如果是某个男孩呢？

'Unlikely,' she thought rather haughtily. 'I've don't even know many boys, and all the ones I do are morons.'  
‘不太可能，’她有些傲慢地想。‘我甚至不认识多少男孩，而且我认识的那些都是笨蛋。’

Looking down at the earrings for a moments longer, she grabbed the case beside her which she found them, and carefully placed them back inside. Placing the case back on her nightstand, she arranged it so that it was with reaching distance as it had been before.  
她又低头看了一会儿耳环，随后拿起找到它们的盒子，小心翼翼地放回原处。将盒子重新放回床头柜上，她调整了位置，确保伸手可及，就像之前那样。

'I don't know what significance it played...before, but I feel as though that hasn't changed at all.'  
'我不知道它之前有什么重要意义...但现在，我感觉一切都没有改变。'

Closing her eyes, she dropped into a peaceful sleep as weariness overcame her such as she had never felt.  
她闭上眼睛，疲惫如潮水般袭来，她从未如此疲惫，很快便沉沉睡去。

---

If only Shinji's sleep could have been that peaceful.  
要是真嗣的睡眠能如此安宁就好了。

He woke up well into the night, having slept earlier after returning from seeing Rebecca, and he now saw that resting those extra few hours had been a mistake. Though with his eyes fully awake, he felt like going to Unit 01's chamber for some reason.  
他在深夜醒来，之前从见完丽贝卡回来后小睡了一会儿，现在他意识到多休息那几个小时是个错误。尽管眼睛已经完全清醒，不知为何他感到想去初号机的机库。

Remembering the familiar path that he had taken the first time, he entered the elevator, and slowly descended into the heart of Nerv. Though as the elevator door opened he intended to step out onto the walkway, but drew back suddenly as he saw to figures already standing in front of Unit 01. Peaking around the corner he saw two of the unlikeliest conversational partners talking to each other, and whats more, it seemed that they appeared to be arguing.  
他记得第一次走过的熟悉路径，走进电梯，缓缓下降到 NERV 的核心区域。当电梯门打开时，他本打算踏上走道，却突然退了回来，因为他看到初号机前已经站着两个人影。从角落窥视，他发现两个最不可能成为对话伙伴的人正在交谈，而且似乎还在争吵。

"Ayanami and...Kaoru?" he mumbled.  
"绫波和...薰？" 他喃喃自语。

They were standing on the walkway facing each other and seemed to be talking as if they knew each other, but Shinji wasn't mistaken in the tone of their voices. Rei, who very rarely showed emotion but had slowly improved was clearly showing an emotion that Shinji had never expected to see. She almost looked...angry? No, that wasn't quite right. It was more like she disapproved. Kaoru on the other hand was still smiling as if everything was perfectly fine, but it was his eyes that gave him away. They were cold and hard as he stared back at Rei.  
他们站在通道上面对面，似乎在交谈，仿佛彼此相识，但真嗣没有听错他们声音中的语气。绫波，一个极少表露情感但逐渐有所改善的人，此刻明显流露出一种真嗣从未预料到的情绪。她几乎看起来...生气了？不，那不完全对。更像是她不赞同。而薰这边，尽管依然微笑着，仿佛一切都很正常，但他的眼睛却出卖了他。他的目光冰冷而坚硬，凝视着绫波。

'I feel like I shouldn't be watching this...but I also feel as though it has something to do with me. Why else would they be in Unit 01's chamber?'  
'我觉得我不应该看这一幕...但我也觉得这似乎与我有关。否则他们为何会在初号机的驾驶舱里？'

Watching for a few minutes longer, Shinji was tempted to step out and interrupt them when the two of them seemed to reach a conclusion to their discussion and Kaoru gave one last smile before he walked away. Shinji was glad that he had not decided to walk to the elevator that he was standing in.  
再观察了几分钟后，真嗣差点忍不住走出去打断他们，但当两人似乎结束了讨论，薰最后微笑着离开时，真嗣庆幸自己没有决定走进那个他正站着的电梯。

Thinking about the best course of action, Shinji found that he couldn't ignore Rei standing there any longer and walked out on the walkway. Though as he reached her back which turned was towards him, she said, "What are you doing here." It wasn't accusatory or curious. Simply a statement.  
思考着最佳行动方案，真嗣发现他不能再忽视站在那里的丽，于是走上了走道。尽管当他走到背对着他的她的身后时，她说：“你在这里做什么。”这不是责问或好奇，只是一个简单的陈述。

As Shinji walked past her, he looked up at the face of Unit 01 and said while shrugging, "Couldn't sleep...and I could ask you the same thing. What are you doing here?"  
当真嗣从她身边走过时，他抬头看着 01 号机，耸耸肩说：“睡不着……我也可以问你同样的问题。你在这里做什么？”

"I was ordered here." "我是被命令来这里的。"

"By who?" "被谁？"

"The commander." "指挥官。"

"My father? Why?" "我父亲？为什么？"

"I'm on standby incase the next angel decides to attack suddenly."  
"我待命以防下一个使徒突然袭击。"

Shinji sighed and said, "I had heard that Nerv was tightening security, but I didn't think that we'd have to remain on standby into the night also."  
真嗣叹了口气说：“我听说 NERV 正在加强安保，但没想到我们还得夜间待命。”

"I do not mind." "我并不介意。"

Shinji turned his gaze away from Unit 01 and instead looked at Rei out of the corner of his eye. He wanted to ask what she was talking about with Kaoru, but figured she wouldn't answer.  
真嗣将目光从初号机上移开，转而用眼角余光看向丽。他想问她和薰在谈些什么，但又觉得她不会回答。

"You go," he said instead. "I'll stay here on standby since I can't sleep."  
"你去吧，"他改口道，"我留在这里待命，反正我也睡不着。"

Rei looked at him rather questionably for a second before she asked, "Are you sure?"  
丽看着他，眼神中带着一丝疑问，片刻后问道：“你确定吗？”

"Don't worry about it...I need to think about somethings anyway."  
“别担心……我正好需要思考一些事情。”

Rei looked at him for a moment before she said, "Okay...let me know if you desire to switch later in the night."  
丽看了他一会儿，然后说：“好吧……如果晚上你想换班，告诉我。”

"Okay," mumbled Shinji not really listening to her.  
“好吧，”真嗣咕哝着，其实并没有在听她说话。

Rei then turned and walked towards the elevator which Shinji came down and ascended back into the uppermost levels of Nerv, leaving Shinji to his own thoughts about what tomorrow might bring.  
随后，绫波转身走向电梯，那是真嗣下来的地方，她升回了 NERV 的最上层，留下真嗣独自思考明天可能带来的事情。

---

The elevator doors opened for Kaoru and he stepped out.  
电梯门为薰打开，他走了出来。

As he walked down the long dark hallways of Nerv, he replayed the conversation he had just had with Ayanami Rei.  
当他穿过 Nerv 那漫长而昏暗的走廊时，他反复回想着刚刚与绫波零的对话。

'Or at least as she calls herself,' thought Kaoru.  
“或者至少是她自称的身份，”薰心想。

They had recognized each other for what they were immediately upon seeing each other. It was during his synchronization test that they had seen each other. He, as he climbed out of the entry plug of Unit 02, having achieved a virtually perfect synchronization, though admittedly he could have gone higher. And her, as she watched from the control room.  
他们一见面就立刻认出了彼此的真实身份。那是在他的同步测试中，他们第一次相遇。他，从二号机插入栓中爬出，取得了近乎完美的同步率，尽管他承认本可以更高。而她，则从控制室里注视着他。

"Ayanami Rei as the embodiment of Lilith, and Nagisa Kaoru, myself, as the embodiment of Adam. ...Then where does Ikari Shinji fit into all of this?"  
"绫波零作为莉莉丝的化身，而我，渚薰，作为亚当的化身。...那么碇真嗣在这其中又扮演什么角色呢？"

However something else was troubling Kaoru, something that having the soul of Adam resting inside of him could only detect.  
然而，薰心中还有其他困扰，那是只有体内承载着亚当灵魂的他才能察觉到的事情。

"Where is the soul of Lilith?" he whispered.  
"莉莉丝的灵魂在哪里？" 他低声自语。

He did not know this, and it troubled him. Ayanami Rei did not have the soul of Lilith residing in her, which didn't make sense. Unless the persona of Ayanami Rei had developed a soul of its own, but the foundation of her existence was still that of Lilith. As the embodiment of Adam, the only thing that could trouble him was this. But he still had time to think of this, for something else would be coming soon.  
他并不知晓这一点，这让他感到困扰。绫波零体内并没有莉莉丝的灵魂，这说不通。除非绫波零的人格已经自行孕育出了灵魂，但她的存在基础仍旧是莉莉丝。作为亚当的化身，唯一能困扰他的便是此事。但他仍有时间思考，因为不久将有其他事情发生。

Looking up to the ceiling of the hallway he was in, his red eyes seemed to pierce through it and look off into the far distance.  
他抬头望向所在走廊的天花板，那双红眸仿佛穿透了它，望向遥远的彼方。

"Looks like my brothers time is almost here."  
“看来我兄弟的时刻即将到来。”

### Chapter 23: Meeting

**Well...it hasn't even been a week since the last chapter was posted, so at this rate it should be finished by...mid July or so. Many things are going to be coming out in the next two chapters, and one major thing will be revealed. So stay tuned!.  
嗯...距离上一章发布还不到一周，照这个速度，应该能在...七月中旬左右完结。接下来的两章会有许多事情揭晓，其中一项重大秘密也将被揭示。敬请期待！**

---

Shinji could almost feel the impeding danger before it happened, which is why he was ready before the alarms were even sounded.  
真嗣几乎在危险发生前就能感觉到它的逼近，这就是为什么在警报响起之前他就已经做好了准备。

He had ended spending the entire night in Unit 01's chamber, rotating between sleeping and thinking, though admittedly, he spent more time just sitting there and staring at Unit 01 without any clear thought in his mind. However, almost as though he had been waiting for it, the second that the alarms started, he was already moving and changing into his plug suit. Though he wasn't the only one.  
他最终在零号机格纳库度过了一整夜，轮流睡觉和思考，尽管坦白说，他更多时间只是坐在那里，盯着零号机发呆，脑海中没有任何清晰的思绪。然而，几乎就像是在等待这一刻，警报一响，他就已经开始行动并换上了插入栓服。虽然他并不是唯一一个。

As Shinji pressed the button on the right wrist of the plug suit that tightly pressed it to the rest of his body and clipped the A10's to his head, Kaoru walked in to the changing room as though this was a drill they ran every day.  
当真嗣按下插入栓服右腕上的按钮，使其紧贴身体其他部分，并将 A10 神经连接器夹在头上时，薰就像这是他们每天进行的演练一样走进了更衣室。

Shinji and his eyes met for a minute, during which Shinji didn't give an inclination that he wished to talk, though Kaoru didn't seem as though he shared the same desire.  
真嗣和他的目光交汇了一会儿，期间真嗣没有表现出任何想要交谈的迹象，尽管薰似乎并不抱有同样的愿望。

"Shinji-kun. You sure got here earlier."  
"真嗣君，你确实来得早啊。"

"As did you," replied Shinji, knowing that ignoring someone like him would never work.  
"你也一样，"真嗣回答道，他知道像他这样的人是无法被忽视的。

"Me? I was walking around the Geofront, examining the lake and the trees when the alarms sounded."  
“我？我当时正在地底峡谷里闲逛，观察着湖泊和树木，突然警报就响了。”

"Err...I don't mean to be rude, but do you honestly expect to sortie today?"  
“呃……我不是有意冒犯，但你真的指望今天出击吗？”

Laughing lightly, Kaoru said as he dawned his own plug suit (which like Shinji's was colored blue on the bottom half, but on the upper half was a dark shade of gray), "I don't know if I will, but if I do I'll be sure to help. I may not have as much experience as you and Ayanami Rei does, but I hope that I can learn. At most I'll be put on standby."  
轻笑一声，薰一边穿上自己的插入栓服（和真嗣的一样，下半部分是蓝色，但上半部分是深灰色），一边说道：“我不知道会不会出击，但如果需要的话，我会尽力帮忙。虽然我没有你和绫波零那么多的经验，但我希望能学到一些。最多也就是待命吧。”

Shinji ignored the fact that he had neglected in mentioning Asuka's name. The fact that he would be piloting Unit 02 was already bad enough.  
真嗣忽略了未提及明日香名字的事实。光是他将驾驶二号机这件事就已经够糟糕了。

Continuing to look at him for a brief second longer, he thought of asking him how his synchronization test went, but decided better of it.  
又多看了他一秒钟，他本想问他的同步测试进行得如何，但还是决定不问为妙。

"Do we know anything about this angel?" asked Shinji as he made to leave the locker room.  
“我们对这个使徒有什么了解吗？”真嗣问道，同时准备离开更衣室。

Shaking his head, Kaoru said, "No, it just descended through the atmosphere minutes ago and seems to be simply hovering in place. It looks just like a halo."  
摇了摇头，薰说道：“不，它几分钟前才穿过大气层，现在似乎只是悬停在原地。看起来就像一个光环。”

'Rather fitting in a way,' thought Shinji.  
“某种程度上倒也挺合适的，”真嗣心想。

"Well I'm going, cya out there if you make it," said Shinji as he left through the sliding door.  
“那我先走了，如果你赶得上的话外面见，”真嗣说着，从滑动门离开了。

He missed the smile that Kaoru sent in his direction.  
他错过了薰朝他投来的微笑。

Asuka would have dearly liked to have slept longer, still feeling slightly weary about the previous day, but Misato had other plans. Almost at the crack of dawn, just as Shinji was dawning his plug suit, she walked into Asuka's room and quickly roused her.  
明日香本想再多睡一会儿，毕竟对前一天仍感到些许疲惫，但美里却另有打算。几乎在黎明破晓时分，正当真嗣穿上插入栓服时，她走进了明日香的房间，迅速将她唤醒。

"...Misato? What time is it?"  
“……美里？现在几点了？”

"I've no idea but we need to leave for Nerv right now. Just throw on some clothes."  
"我不知道，但我们现在得去 Nerv。随便穿点衣服就行了。"

"But what about a shower? And I look terrible," replied Asuka as she looked in the mirror across her room that rested on her dresser.  
"但是洗澡怎么办？我还这么难看，" 明日香一边回答，一边看着房间里梳妆台上方的镜子。"

"No time," said Misato, clearly desperate to leave. "An anxgel just descended on Tokyo-3 and I have to go in, and I can't have you staying here alone without annoying watching you."  
"没时间了，" 美里说，显然急于离开。"一个使徒刚刚降临在东京-3，我必须进去，我不能让你一个人呆在这里没人看着。"

"I don't need a baby sitter," mumbled Asuka feeling slightly disgruntled.  
"我不需要保姆," 明日香咕哝着，感到有些不悦。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

"Fine I get it," she said as she tossed the covers off herself, and slowly walked over to her dresser.  
"好吧，我明白了," 她说着掀开被子，慢慢走向自己的梳妆台。

"I'll give you seven minutes," said Misato as she turned around and closed the door to Asuka room.  
"我给你七分钟," 美里说着转过身，关上了明日香的房门。

'I see you had plenty of time to fix yourself up,' thought Asuka feeling annoyed as Misato left her room, already having taken a shower earlier.  
'看来你有足够的时间打扮自己，'明日香心里想着，感到有些恼火，因为美里已经洗完澡离开了她的房间。

Opening several drawers to her dresser, she went through a lot of the different clothes she had worn, wondering why she hadn't bothered buying anything new while here in Tokyo-3. Finally deciding on something incredibly simple, she threw the clothes she had fallen asleep in into a corner and undid the clasp on each of the shoulder straps that held her bra against her chest. Pausing here though, she looked at her semi naked self in the mirror and then turned around to look at the nightstand next to her bed where the case holding the earrings still rested. Shaking her head though after thinking about it, she turned back to the mirror and said to her reflection, "No, I shouldn't wear them. Its something too dear to me."  
她打开梳妆台的几个抽屉，翻找着曾经穿过的各种衣服，不明白为什么在东京-3 期间没有买些新衣服。最终选定了一件极其简单的衣服，她将昨晚睡觉时穿的衣物扔到角落，解开了固定胸罩的每一条肩带。但在这里她停了下来，看着镜中半裸的自己，然后转身看向床头柜，那里还放着装有耳环的盒子。经过一番思考后，她摇了摇头，转回镜子前对着自己的倒影说：“不，我不应该戴它们。它们对我来说太珍贵了。”

"Asuka? Are you done yet?" came Misato's voice just outside her door  
“明日香？你好了吗？”门外传来了美里的声音。

"Almost," said Asuka untruthfully.  
"差不多吧，" 明日香不诚实地回答道。

After several more minutes though, which Misato spent most of her time tapping her foot on the floor, Asuka finally opened the door to her room. As before, she had decided on something simple, this being a pair of dark blue jeans that was cut off just above the knees, and a bright red shirt, one of her favorites. And as usual, she had the A10 nerve clips holding her hair up. Though as Misato saw these, she hoped that Asuka didn't expect to pilot, even though she did wear them everywhere she went.  
又过了几分钟，期间美里大部分时间都在用脚敲打着地板，明日香终于打开了她的房门。和之前一样，她选择了一件简单的衣服，一条深蓝色的牛仔短裤，以及一件她最喜欢的鲜红色衬衫。一如既往地，她用 A10 神经夹固定住头发。尽管美里看到这些夹子时，她希望明日香不要指望驾驶 EVA，尽管她走到哪儿都戴着它们。

"Hurry, we need to go. I was supposed to be there half an hour ago."  
"快点，我们得走了。我应该半小时前就到那儿的。"

'Like thats my fault,' thought Asuka.  
“好像那是我的错似的，”明日香心想。

"Well with your driving we'll be sure to make it in record time," said Asuka smugly.  
“好吧，有你开车，我们肯定会以创纪录的时间到达，”明日香得意地说。

---

The elevator doors opened for Shinji and he walked out into the command center. Both Rei and Ritsuko were there, but he didn't see any sign of Misato, but then he did a double take as he saw that somebody else was there.  
电梯门为真嗣打开，他走出进入指挥中心。丽和律子都在那里，但他没看到美里，不过他定睛一看，发现还有其他人。

"Father?" he mumbled. "父亲？" 他含糊地问道。

Gendo Ikari was sitting in his usually chair with Kozo Fuyutsuki on his right side. Apparently he was overseeing this operation as well as the last. Shinji narrowed his eyes as he remembered the complete screwup that was the previous operation and hoped that there wouldn't be a repeat. Now trying to ignore the presence of his father, he walked over to Ritsuko and Rei, saying a brief hello to Rei before he asked Ritsuko, "How come Misato's not here yet?"  
碇源堂坐在他通常的椅子上，旁边是副司令官葛城美里。显然，他也在监督这次行动，就像上次一样。真嗣眯起眼睛，回想起上次那场彻底搞砸的行动，希望这次不要再重蹈覆辙。他试图忽略父亲的在场，走向赤木律子和绫波零，简短地向绫波打了个招呼，然后问赤木："美里怎么还没来？"

"She slept in late, or at leasts thats her excuse. Though I imagine she had a rough time last night."  
"她睡过头了，至少这是她的借口。不过我想她昨晚过得不太顺利。"

Shinji then looked at Ritsuko rather skeptically and asked, "...Why?"  
真嗣然后怀疑地看着律子，问道：“……为什么？”

"...You heard that Asuka is awake and all?"  
“……你听说明日香醒了，对吧？”

"Yeah, and that she's living with Misato again. I already had all my stuff taken out of there and moved to storage two days ago, so there shouldn't be any-"  
“嗯，而且她又和美里住在一起了。我两天前已经把所有东西搬出来存好了，所以应该没什么——”

"How do you rate Asuka's level of intelligence?"  
"你觉得明日香智力水平如何？"

Shinji had to hold back a mocking laugh here.  
真嗣在这里不得不忍住嘲讽的笑声。

"She went to college...so what do you think?"  
"她上过大学...你觉得呢？"

Ignoring Shinji's remark, Ritsuko instead said, "Then how do you think Misato dealt with the bombardment of questions that Asuka was sure to ask her?"  
无视真嗣的评论，律子转而说道：“那么你认为美里是如何应对明日香肯定会向她提出的连珠炮似的问题的呢？”

As realization seemed to dawn on Shinji, he hung his head slightly and said, "Oh...I see what you mean. Though I don't think she would say anything too...damaging."  
真嗣似乎恍然大悟，他微微低下头说：“哦……我明白你的意思了。不过我觉得她不会说出什么太……有损形象的话。”

'To Asuka or to you,' thought Ritsuko silently.  
“对明日香还是对你，”律子默默地想。

"Thats not all though. Asuka had another physical examination that I had scheduled, but it doesn't look as though that will happen because of this," said Ritsuko, gesturing to the floating halo like angel on the screens. "And Misato wont let her stay at the apartment alone, so Asuka will be coming in...and soon most likely."  
“但这还不是全部。明日香还有我安排的另一项体检，但看来因为这件事无法进行了，”律子说着，指向屏幕上悬浮着的光环般的天使。“而且美里不会让她独自留在公寓，所以明日香会来这里……很可能很快就会到。”

It took Shinji a long time to reply or even move after what she had said. A million things were running through his mind then. How should he react when he first see's her again? Should he ignore her? Act as though it was there first time meeting? Maybe he should adopt her own attitude, and be abrasive and rude, that way she'd hate him from the go.  
听了她的话后，真嗣花了很长时间才做出回应或有所动作。当时他的脑海中闪过无数念头。再次见到她时他应该如何反应？应该无视她吗？表现得像是初次见面？也许他应该采取她那种态度，变得尖锐无礼，这样她一开始就会讨厌他。

"Shinji...are you okay?" asked Ritsuko, pulling Shinji out of his train of thought.  
“真嗣……你还好吗？”律子问道，将真嗣从思绪中拉回。

"What? Yeah...fine. Thanks for telling me this."  
“什么？嗯……好吧。谢谢你告诉我这些。”

Ritsuko looked at him passively for a second before she said, "Do you want to stay or-"  
律子平静地看了他一秒钟，然后说：“你想留下来还是——”

"I can't keep ignoring this," said Shinji not showing much emotion now. "And sooner or later I will have to talk with her."  
“我不能再这样忽视下去了，”真嗣现在没有表现出太多情绪，“迟早我得和她谈谈。”

"Well yes, seeing as how you work together. But are you okay mentally? These past few days I've noticed that you've become increasingly erratic...and yesterday you came back soaked in-"  
"嗯，既然你们一起工作。但你心理上还好吗？这几天我注意到你变得越来越不稳定……昨天你回来时浑身湿透了……"

"What I do outside of Nerv is none of your business," said Shinji harshly.  
"我在 NERV 之外做什么不关你的事，" 真嗣严厉地说。"

"Shinji, I understand that this is hard, putting on this face and-"  
"真嗣，我明白这很难，戴上这副面具和……"

"What would you understand?" he replied, rebuking her angrily. "You understand even less then Misato does, because you can't even understand how I felt!"  
"你能理解什么？" 他愤怒地反驳她，"你连美里都不如，因为你甚至无法理解我当时的心情！"

That shut Ritsuko up instantly, but his last sentence suddenly confused her. Why had he used the past tense of 'felt?' Unless his feelings had-  
这话让律子立刻哑口无言，但他最后一句突然让她困惑起来。为什么他用的是'感到'的过去式？除非他的感情已经——

Suddenly, the clearing of a throat was heard from above them and Ritsuko turned to see the commander looking at the angel on the screen, but she could almost swear that behind his glasses, his eyes were looking down on them.  
突然，上方传来一声清嗓子的声音，律子转头看到指挥官正盯着屏幕上的使徒，但她几乎可以肯定，透过他的眼镜，他的目光正俯视着他们。

'Best to end this I suppose,' thought Ritsuko.  
“最好结束这一切，我想。”律子心想。

"The pressing problem though," she said now, forgetting there argument, "is how to deal with this angel. Its AT-field has not subsided since it assumed its current position, nor do we have any idea what its capable of. The possibility of it being able to change its form is very high."  
“但迫在眉睫的问题是，”她现在说道，忘记了之前的争论，“如何对付这个使徒。它的 AT 力场自占据当前位置后就没有减弱过，我们也不知道它有什么能力。它能够改变形态的可能性非常高。”

"Send Unit 00 out and Unit 02 out as backup," said Gendo from up high.  
“派出零号机，二号机作为支援。”源堂从高处下令道。

Shinji, rather reluctant, turned to his father and asked, "Why not Unit 01?"  
真嗣颇为不情愿地转向父亲，问道：“为什么不使用 01 号机？”

"I have not removed the freeze that has been placed upon Unit 01," replied Gendo, looking down at Shinji. "Unit 00 will disrupt the angels AT-field while Unit 02 will destroy it with the rifle. Is that acceptable?" said Gendo, looking towards somebody leaning against the wall directly to the left of the elevator doors. Shinji was rather surprised that he was asking for affirmation from somebody other then himself.  
“我并未解除施加在 01 号机上的冻结状态，”源渡低头看着真嗣回答，“00 号机将扰乱使徒的 AT 力场，而 02 号机则用步枪摧毁它。这样可以吗？”源渡说着，看向电梯门左侧靠墙的某个人。真嗣颇为惊讶，父亲竟在向除他之外的人寻求确认。

Now Shinji turned in the direction his father was speaking of, and saw that sometime during his and Ritsuko's conversation, Kaoru had entered the command center.  
这时，真嗣顺着父亲目光的方向转去，发现就在他和律子交谈期间，薰已经进入了指挥中心。

"More than enough," said Kaoru smiling. "If I'm given ample time and if Unit 00 can hold off the angel long enough."  
"绰绰有余，" 薰微笑着说。"如果给我足够的时间，而且零号机能拖住使徒足够久的话。"

"You're...sortieing Kaoru?"  
"你要...出击，薰？"

"Well of course he is," said Ritsuko. "He scored nearly as high as you've done, and during his first synchronization test."  
"当然是他了，" 律子说。"他的同步测试成绩几乎和你一样高，而且是在第一次测试中。"

Shinji looked shocked at this sudden revelation. He had always known that Kaoru was different in some way, and that he would most likely have a high sync ratio...but one to rival his own?  
真嗣对这个突如其来的事实感到震惊。他一直知道薰在某些方面与众不同，而且很可能拥有很高的同步率……但能与自己匹敌？

"What...you said before," mumbled Shinji, in reference to there talk in the locker room.  
“你……之前说的，”真嗣含糊地提到了他们在更衣室的谈话。

"I was being modest, since I knew you wouldn't be able to leave."  
“我那时是谦虚了，因为我知道你不会离开。”

Here his smile stretched so wide that it almost looked as though he had dislocated his jaw to achieve it. But his eyes still seemed cold, at least to Shinji. But even so, everybody else, excluding Rei, seemed to think it was creepy.  
他的笑容拉得如此之宽，几乎让人以为他为了达到这个效果而脱臼了下巴。但他的眼神依然显得冰冷，至少对真嗣来说是如此。即便如此，除了绫波之外的其他人似乎都觉得这很诡异。

"Units 00 and 02 will proceed up shaft three and eight, surrounding the enemy effectively. Operation time will be set to ten minutes, to start as soon as Major Katsuragi arrives." Here he turned to Rei and said, "I'll be counting on you."  
“零号机和二号机将通过三号和八号通道前进，有效包围敌人。行动时间设定为十分钟，待葛城少校一到即刻开始。”他转向绫波说道，“就拜托你了。”

Shinji couldn't help but feel a little jealous as he saw the look of care pass over his fathers face, something that he would never see in one hundred years. But he was even more surprised as Rei's mouth seemed to draw up in a smile.  
真嗣不禁感到一丝嫉妒，因为他看到父亲脸上流露出的关怀之色，这是他一百年也看不到的。但更让他惊讶的是，绫波的嘴角似乎勾勒出一丝微笑。

"What about me?" asked Shinji, not caring whether he got an answer or not.  
"我呢？" 真嗣问道，并不在乎是否得到回答。

"Standby in Unit 01 until the operation is over," said Gendo without looking at him.  
"在 01 号机中待命，直到行动结束，" 源渡头也不抬地说道。

'How about I get in Unit 01 and tear of your fucking-'  
'我何不进入 01 号机，撕烂你那该死的——'

But he had to calm himself down, getting any more angry than he already was, and his angel self might just come boiling to the surface. Then he'd be in solitary confinement for the rest of the day.  
但他必须让自己冷静下来，不能再让怒火升级，否则他的天使自我可能会突然爆发。那样的话，他今天剩下的时间就得在单独监禁中度过了。

"Fine," said Shinji, not bothering to hold back the sneer that escaped his lips.  
“好吧，”真嗣说道，懒得掩饰从唇边溜出的讥讽。

Walking away from everybody, he though that at most he'd be able to mull everything over inside of Unit 01, since it seemed that was the only place he could escape everything now. Though as he walked to the elevator, they opened of there own accord and two people stepped out.  
他离开众人，心想最多只能在初号机里沉思一番，因为现在似乎只有那里是他能逃避一切的地方。然而，当他走向电梯时，电梯门自行打开，两个人走了出来。

No matter what Shinji had said to Ritsuko, he had hoped that he would be able to put off this meeting for at least another day, but found he had no other choice, as Misato stepped out of the elevator with Asuka in tow, who was looking extremely stunning with the dark blue pair of jeans and red short sleeve shirt she was wearing. Shinji couldn't but feel slightly glad to at least see her and know that at most, she still looked the same, but it was underneath all that that worried him.  
无论碇真嗣对赤木律子说了什么，他都希望至少能将这次会面再推迟一天，却发现别无选择，因为美里带着明日香从电梯里走了出来，明日香穿着深蓝色牛仔裤和红色短袖衬衫，显得格外迷人。真嗣不禁感到一丝欣慰，至少看到她，知道她外表依旧，但真正让他担忧的是她的内心。

He had rehearsed this conversation many times before, with varying people present at the time, but now felt that it was impossible to truly prepare himself for this, so deciding to blow caution to the winds, he said, "Oh, hey Misato. Glad to see you made it. Ritsuko said that you would be late."  
他之前多次排练过这场对话，有时身边还有其他人，但现在他觉得无论如何都无法真正准备好，于是决定抛开顾虑，说道：“哦，嘿，美里。很高兴你赶到了。赤木博士说你会迟到。”

"...Yeah," mumbled Misato, just as clearly shocked about being suddenly thrust between the reunion of Shinji and Asuka, one of which had know idea that the boy standing before her was the boy that she had once had feelings for and had given her the earrings.  
“……是啊，”美里含糊地应道，同样明显地对突然被卷入真嗣和明日香的团聚感到震惊，其中一人完全不知道站在她面前的男孩就是她曾经动过心并送给她耳环的那个男孩。

Asuka however looked around Misato to glance at Shinji, who she of course didn't know the name of. But her first impression was, 'Another dork, just like the two stooges back at school. He'll soon be fawning over everything I do, just as all the others.'  
然而，明日香绕过美里瞥了一眼真嗣，当然，她并不知道他的名字。但她的第一印象是：‘又一个呆子，就像学校里的那两个傻瓜一样。他很快就会对我所做的一切趋之若鹜，就像其他人一样。’

Shinji was trying to ignore Asuka as much as possible, but found it difficult with her looking him over, since to her, it was her first time seeing him. He found this increasingly difficult as he hadn't seen her face since he had left her hospital room those many nights ago, and knew that if he pushed his resolve too far, he'd possibly break down and start crying.  
真嗣尽可能地忽视明日香，但发现她打量他的目光让他难以忽视，因为对她来说，这是第一次见到他。自从许多夜晚前离开她的病房后，他就没有再见过她的脸，他知道如果他的决心过于动摇，他可能会崩溃并开始哭泣。

"You heading down to Unit 01?" asked Misato.  
“你要去初号机那边吗？”美里问道。

"Yeah, but I probably wont be sortieing," said Shinji, praying to God that she wouldn't mention anything about the freeze, or how high his sync ratio was. That was sure to get Asuka angry, and curious about him.  
“是啊，但我可能不会出击，”真嗣说道，暗自祈祷她不要提到冻结的事，或是他的同步率有多高。那肯定会惹恼明日香，还会让她对他产生好奇。

"Kaoru and Ayanami will be fighting this time." Shinji purposefully left out the part about Unit 02 being piloted by Kaoru. Call him a coward or whatever, but he was not going to be the one that broke the news to Asuka that her Eva was being piloted by somebody else.  
“这次是薰和绫波会去战斗。”真嗣故意没有提到 02 号机是由薰驾驶的。不管别人怎么说他胆小，他可不想成为那个告诉明日香她的 Eva 被别人驾驶的人。

"Well, be careful if the commander does send you out," said Misato, only too eager to end the conversation. "You are a promising pilot, and we wouldn't want to lose you."  
“嗯，如果指挥官真的派你出去，要小心，”美里说道，巴不得快点结束对话。“你是个有前途的驾驶员，我们可不想失去你。”

Shinji was rather surprised at how cool Misato had played that, and had to assume she had spent last night working on what he himself had tried to do.  
真嗣对美里处理那件事的冷静感到相当惊讶，不得不猜想她昨晚可能一直在研究他自己试图做的事情。

"Will do Misato...and thanks."  
“会做的，美里……谢谢。”

Shinji now started walking towards the elevator, where he of course would have to pass by Asuka, though Misato turned towards him and said quite clearly, speaking in the voice she normally wore for battles instead of the fake one she had been using.  
真嗣开始向电梯走去，当然他必须经过明日香，但美里转向他，用平时战斗时的声音清晰地说道，而不是她一直在用的那种假声。

"Shinji...be careful..." “真嗣...小心点...”

Shinji seemed to pause as his own name was mentioned and thought briefly about how he should reply, when he released his tension that had skyrocketed the second he saw Asuka and said, "Right...thanks Misato." He meant it in more ways than one.  
听到自己的名字，真嗣似乎顿了一下，思索片刻后该如何回应，当他看到明日香时，紧张感瞬间飙升，随即放松下来，说道：“好的...谢谢美里。”他的感谢蕴含了不止一层意思。

Turning towards the elevator, he also reluctantly turned towards Asuka, and in the brief second he looked at her face, he saw several things. First: she had a slight frown plastered on her beautiful face, something that did not suit her, at least as far as Shinji thought. It was then that he thought, 'She's already heard my name before?' But it wasn't that surprising that she would have heard him mentioned sometime yesterday. Second, however, something else happened, though it was more readable in her eyes, and only Shinji could have picked it up. It seemed like something had...pained her. He thought he saw her briefly wince as though some sort of pain had hit her that lasted less than a second. But what on earth could that have been?  
转向电梯的同时，他也无奈地转向明日香，就在他看向她的那一瞬间，他注意到了几件事。首先：她美丽的脸上带着一丝皱眉，这在真嗣看来并不适合她。这时他心想，‘她之前已经听过我的名字了吗？’不过她昨天听到他名字提及也不足为奇。然而，第二点，还有其他事情发生，虽然更多是从她的眼神中读出的，只有真嗣能察觉到。似乎有什么东西...让她感到痛苦。他觉得她短暂地皱了一下眉，仿佛某种疼痛只持续了不到一秒。但这究竟会是什么呢？

All this happened in almost less than a second, before Shinji passed Asuka without even a single word directed at her, which struck Asuka as very odd, seeing as how every boy she had ever met had been stricken dumb at the sight of her. Yet here was a boy that didn't even pass a glance at her.  
这一切几乎在不到一秒的时间内发生，真嗣从明日香身边经过，甚至没有对她说过一句话，这让明日香感到非常奇怪，因为她所遇到的每个男孩见到她都会目瞪口呆。然而，这个男孩甚至没有瞥她一眼。

'And why did I suddenly have a splitting headache?' thought Asuka.  
“为什么我突然头痛欲裂？”明日香心想。

After Asuka heard the sound of the elevator leaving the commander center, she hurried to Misato's side who had already walked over to Ritsuko and was talking to her hurriedly, asking for any updates or information acquired from the angel.  
在明日香听到电梯离开指挥中心的声音后，她急忙走到美里身边，美里已经走到律子旁边，正急切地询问从使徒那里获得的任何更新或信息。

"Misato...who was that?" "美里...刚才那个人是谁？"

"Who was what?" replied Misato, not really paying attention as she read over several papers detailing the angels AT-field.  
""什么谁啊？"" 美里回答道，她并没有真正注意，因为她正在阅读几份详细描述使徒 AT 力场的文件。

"That boy that you talked to...Shinji...or whatever the hell his name was."  
"你刚才交谈的那个男孩...真嗣...还是他妈的什么名字。"

"Him? He's the third child," said Misato, still not looking up from her papers. "He's Shinji Ikari and the pilot of Evangelion Unit 01."  
"他？他是第三个孩子，" 美里说，目光依旧没有离开文件。"他是碇真嗣，EVA 初号机的驾驶员。"

"Ikari...so he's related to-"  
"碇...那他和-"

"Yes the commander...he's his son actually."  
"是的，司令...实际上他是他的儿子。"

"Hmph, explains how he got to become a pilot," said an annoyed Asuka.  
"哼，难怪他能成为飞行员，"明日香不悦地说道。

Asuka then turned and looked behind her where she had thought the pet and the other boy had stood, only to see that they had also left.  
明日香随即转身，看向她以为宠物和另一个男孩站立的地方，却发现他们也已经离开了。

"So the other one...he's the fourth?"  
"这么说，另一个是第四个？"

"Yes, his name is Nagisa Kaoru, and he's your classmate."  
"是的，他叫渚薰，是你同学。"

"I see," said Asuka. "Well I should probably get ready myself."  
"明白了，"明日香说。"那我也该准备一下了。"

This time, Misato did turn toward her and said, "We can't have you pilot yet."  
这次，美里确实转向了她，说道："我们还不能让你驾驶。"

"What? Why not? I feel fine."  
"什么？为什么不？我感觉很好。"

"I'm sure you do, but we wont know for sure until we run synchronization tests with you and Unit 02."  
"我确信你感觉良好，但我们必须通过你和二号机之间的同步测试才能确定。"

"I know myself better than anyone. And besides, they need me out there. The new idiots wont even know how to fire their rifles properly."  
"我比任何人都了解自己。而且，他们需要我在外面。那些新手甚至不知道如何正确开枪。"

"If they need help, Rei can give them some pointers," said Misato all the while thinking how both Kaoru and Shinji had higher sync ratios than Asuka.  
"如果他们需要帮助，丽可以给他们一些指导，" 美里一边说，一边想着甲午和真嗣的同步率都比明日香高。

"Tch, the pet? All she knows how to do is follow orders."  
"哼，那宠物？她只知道服从命令。"

"Asuka, if you're finished I need you to find a seat and sit down. I can't be talking to you while I talk with the pilots."  
"明日香，如果你说完了，我需要你找个座位坐下。我不能一边和你说话一边和驾驶员们交谈。"

"Who cares about them," said Asuka stubbornly as she found a seat as Misato had suggested.  
“谁在乎他们，”明日香固执地说着，按照美里建议的那样找了个座位坐下。

After being certain that Asuka was sitting, Misato turned back to the screens and said to Rei and Kaoru, "The angel still hasn't made a move, but the moment you leave the Geofront, be prepared for interception. As planned, Unit 00 will open a hole in the angels AT-field, while Unit 02 provides cover fire and eventually destroys the angel."  
确认明日香坐好后，美里转向屏幕，对绫波和薰说道：“使徒仍未有动作，但一旦你们离开地表，就要准备好迎击。按照计划，零号机会在使徒的 AT 力场中打开一个缺口，而二号机则提供掩护火力，最终摧毁使徒。”

Asuka's head whipped around the second she heard Unit 02 mentioned.  
明日香一听到二号机被提及，头立刻转向了那边。

"Okay, you have your orders. Unit 00, Unit 02, operation commen-Asuka what are you doing!"  
"好了，你们接到命令了。零号机，二号机，行动开始——明日香，你在干什么！"

Asuka had pushed her aside and looked up at the screen showing the Eva's standing side by side on the catapult, ready to be sent up. To the right of Unit 00 stood-  
明日香将她推开，抬头看向屏幕，屏幕上显示着 EVA 们并排站在弹射器上，准备出击。在零号机的右侧站着——

"WHY THE FUCK IS MY EVA OUT THERE! AND WHO THE FUCK IS PILOTING IT!"  
"我的 EVA 为什么会在外面！还有谁他妈的在驾驶它！"

Misato, shaking herself off from being pushed fairly roughly by Asuka, hurriedly said, "Asuka, this is only a temporary thing and-"  
美里被明日香相当粗鲁地推开后，急忙说道，“明日香，这只是暂时的，而且——”

"I DON'T CARE IF ITS EVEN FOR A SECOND! NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED TO PILOT THAT EXCEPT MYSELF! GET WHOEVER THE HELL IS IN THERE OUT!"  
“我不管这是不是一秒钟的事！除了我自己，谁也不准驾驶那东西！把里面的人给我赶出来！”

"Asuka we need Unit 02 and seeing as how you can't pilot yet-"  
"“明日香，我们需要二号机，而你目前还不能驾驶——”

"CAN'T PILOT YET! WHO SAID THAT! I KNOW MY BODY PERFECTLY WELL AND I SAY THAT I CAN PILOT!"  
"还不能驾驶！谁说的！我对自己的身体了如指掌，我说我能驾驶！"

"And I'm saying that its out of the question!" said Misato, speaking extremely sternly and only too aware that Shinji was probably listening to this conversation right now.  
"我说这绝对不行！" 美里极其严厉地说道，她非常清楚真嗣很可能正在听这场对话。

Asuka seemed to open her mouth in another angry retort, when she instead said, "Fuck you!" And ran towards the elevator, hammering the button until the lift arrived.  
明日香似乎又要张口反驳，却突然骂了句："去你的！" 然后朝电梯跑去，猛按按钮直到电梯到来。

Misato frowned at her, guessing what she had said. But really, it was stupid of her to get so angry over this. But then again, piloting Unit 02 was how she proved that everything she's done before now, wasn't in vain.  
美里皱眉看着她，猜到了她的话。但说真的，为这事如此生气真是愚蠢。不过话说回来，驾驶二号机是她证明自己之前所做的一切并非徒劳的方式。

"Let her go," said Ritsuko while looking at numbers that were flying over the computers. "We have enough problems to deal with," she said as Unit 00 and Unit 02 were sent rocketing up the gates.  
“让她走吧，”律子一边看着电脑上飞快滚动的数据一边说，“我们已经有足够多的问题要处理了。”随着零号机和二号机被发射升空，她补充道。

"...I know," sighed Misato feeling slightly sad.  
“……我知道，”美里叹了口气，感到一丝悲伤。

Turning around, she just had time to see the elevator doors close, sending Asuka back into the heart of Nerv.  
她转过身，刚好看到电梯门关闭，将明日香送回了 NERV 的深处。

Unit 00 came flying out of the ground on a near hill side to the north of Tokyo-3 while Unit 02 did likewise, though slightly to the east of Unit 00's position. As Rei had Unit 00 stand up to its full height, she got her first good look at the angel still hovering in the air. It looked exactly like a giant white halo floating in the air, except it looked similar to a DNA strand with they way the two different strand wrapped around each other.  
零号机从东京-3 北部一座小山坡的地面上飞跃而出，二号机也同样如此，尽管位置略微偏东。当绫波驾驶零号机站起身来，她首次得以清晰地观察到那仍在空中悬浮的天使。它看起来就像一个巨大的白色光环悬浮在空中，只不过那两条不同的螺旋缠绕在一起，酷似 DNA 双螺旋结构。

"Rei," came Misato's voice over the intercom, "The angels AT-field is still up, so wait a moment while Kaoru draws its fire to himself before you move in."  
“绫波，”美里通过通讯器传来声音，“天使的 AT 力场依然存在，所以先等一会儿，让薰吸引它的火力，然后再行动。”

"No," said Rei quickly. "Its coming."  
"不，" 丽迅速说道，"它来了。"

Almost at her very words, the halo like DNA strand suddenly broke on one end, looked towards Unit 00 and then the entire thing suddenly rocketed towards it. Now it was a solid white object in the shape of a giant earthworm, but it seemed much more flexible, able to twist this way and that as it soared towards Unit 00.  
几乎在她话音刚落之际，那条形似光环的 DNA 链突然在一端断裂，转向零号机，随后整个物体猛地向其疾射而去。现在它变成了一个巨大的白色蚯蚓状物体，但似乎更具灵活性，能够自如地扭曲翻转，朝着零号机飞驰而去。

"Rei deploy your AT-field!" yelled Misato.  
"丽，展开你的 AT 力场！" 美里大喊道。

Rei didn't need telling twice as she immediately generated Unit 00's AT-field at full power, but the angel amazingly soared right through, striking where the core of Unit 00. The AT-field that Rei had generated seemed completely useless, as the angel seemed to erode it almost instantly. Suddenly several shots of a rifle seemed to come from far away, striking the angel in its mid section. But it didn't seem to phase it all; the blows sunk right into the angel as though it had absorbed it.  
绫波不需要再次被告知，她立即以全功率生成了零号机的 AT 力场，但那使徒竟然惊人地直接穿透而过，击中了零号机的核心。绫波生成的 AT 力场似乎完全无用，因为使徒几乎瞬间就将其侵蚀。突然间，几发来自远处的步枪射击击中了使徒的中段，但这似乎对它毫无影响；攻击如同被吸收一般，直接沉入了使徒体内。

"Status of Unit 00!" yelled Misato.  
“零号机状态如何！”美里喊道。

"AT-field seems to have been eroded almost on immediate contact with the angel."  
“AT 力场在与使徒接触的瞬间几乎就被侵蚀了。”

"What about the rifle shots? Why didn't they damage it?"  
"那些步枪射击呢？为什么没有造成伤害？"

"Unknown. The angels AT-field wasn't even up and it seemed to absorb the impact of the bullet. Though it may have completely eroded the bullet before contact was achieved," said Ritsuko as she examined the constant readout that the computers were supplying.  
"不清楚。使徒的 AT 力场甚至没有启动，它似乎吸收了子弹的冲击力。尽管在接触之前，子弹可能已经被完全侵蚀了，" 律子一边检查着计算机不断提供的读数，一边说道。

"Kaoru, get down there and help Rei," said into the intercom.  
"薰，下去帮真嗣，" 他对着对讲机说道。

"I'm on it," said Kaoru, and for once he sounded serious.  
"我这就去办，" 薰说道，这次他的语气异常严肃。

"Update on Unit 00." "零号机最新情况。"

"Holding off the angel as best as possible."  
"尽全力牵制天使。"

Though the angel had struck its core, Rei had managed to grab what could be assumed as the head of the angel, and was not holding it at arms length. Though this was apparently the wrong move. Suddenly, the angel seemed to pass directly through the outstretched palm of Unit 00 as though it had turned invisible. Next, from the fingers to the wrist, every single nerve between those two points suddenly bulged forward as though the blood circulation had been cut off. The angel continued forcing its way through the flesh of Unit 00 as though it was fusing itself with the Eva  
尽管天使击中了核心，丽还是设法抓住了天使的头部，并将其保持在臂长之外。然而，这显然是错误的举动。突然间，天使似乎直接穿过了零号机的伸出的手掌，仿佛它变得隐形了。接着，从手指到手腕，这两点之间的每一条神经突然鼓起，仿佛血液循环被切断了。天使继续强行穿过零号机的肉体，仿佛它正在与 Eva 融合。

"Whats going on!" yelled Misato, worrying that by the end of the day she would be hoarse.  
“这是怎么回事！”美里大喊，担心到一天结束时她的嗓子会哑掉。

"The angel seems to be fusing with the bioparts of Unit 00. Pilot life signs are dropping and synchronization has been cut by seven percent. The pilot seems to be...experiencing something similar to the pilot of Unit 01."  
“天使似乎正在与零号机的生物部件融合。驾驶员的生命迹象正在下降，同步率下降了百分之七。驾驶员似乎正在...经历类似于初号机驾驶员的情况。”

"How? Rei's sync ratio isn't anywhere near as high as Shinji's."  
"怎么可能？零的同步率远不及真嗣那么高。"

"No," said Ritsuko in reply to Misato's question. "It seems to be an innate ability of the angel, its fusing with the Eva and taking control of all functions. Though the pilot seems to be experiencing the same as the Eva.  
"不，" 律子回答美里的问题说，"这似乎是使徒的一种固有能力，它与 EVA 融合并接管了所有功能。尽管驾驶员似乎也在经历与 EVA 相同的情况。

She was right. Inside the entry plug of Unit 00, Rei was wincing in pain as every nerve in her right arm was popping out of the plug suit she wore.  
她说得没错。在零号机的插入栓内，零正因右臂上每一根神经从插入栓服中凸出而痛苦地皱眉。

"Rei? Whats wrong? Rei!" "丽？怎么了？丽！"

"Communication has been forcefully cut from the entry plug. Contamination is continuing to spread along the right vertebrae. Ten percent of bioparts have been completely fused."  
"与插入栓的通讯被强行切断。污染正沿着右侧脊椎持续扩散。百分之十的生物部件已完全融合。"

"Bring the concentration of the LCL fluid to the minimum," said Gendo Ikari suddenly. "And eject the entry plug."  
"将 LCL 液体的浓度调至最低，""碇源堂突然说道，""并弹出插入栓。"

"LCL fluid able to lower, but the entry plug is refusing the signal. Umbilical cord detached, four minutes and fifty-eight seconds remaining of power."  
"LCL 液体能够降低，但插入栓拒绝接收信号。脐带电缆已断开，电源剩余四分五十八秒。"

"Kaoru hurry!" said Misato.  
"薰，快点！" 美里喊道。"

Unit 02 soared into the open sky suddenly, blocking out the sun briefly as it landed near the angel. Almost at the very feel of this sudden strange pressure, the angel seemed to change its attention to Unit 02. Next though, even the computers of Nerv couldn't have predicted what happened. The angel seemed to split itself into two separate halves.  
初号机突然冲上开阔的天空，短暂地遮住了太阳，降落在使徒附近。几乎就在感受到这种突如其来的奇怪压力的同时，使徒似乎将注意力转向了初号机。然而接下来，即使是 NERV 的计算机也无法预测会发生什么。使徒似乎分裂成了两个独立的部分。

Before, when it had looked like a giant halo floating in mid air, it had two strands woven together as though it looked like a DNA strand. Now, with a good portion of it already buried in Unit 00, the end of the angel suddenly split in two, before extracting one of the halves out of Unit 00. It didn't even seem like it was made of flesh, more like a mass of raw energy. Now turning its new head towards Unit 02, it flew to it in a straight line, preparing to crush this strange pressure.  
之前，它看起来像一个悬浮在半空中的巨大光环，两条线交织在一起，仿佛是 DNA 链的模样。如今，大部分已经埋入零号机体内，天使的末端突然一分为二，随后从中抽出一半脱离了零号机。它看起来并不像是血肉之躯，更像是一团原始能量。现在，它将新形成的头部转向二号机，直线飞去，准备粉碎这股奇异的压力。

'Bit ironic that I'd be fighting you brother,' though Kaoru briefly, 'but then again this is what was delegated to me.'  
“有点讽刺，我居然要和你战斗，兄弟，”Kaoru 心中掠过这一念头，“但这也是我被赋予的使命。”

Quickly sidestepping the angel, he grabbed the prog knife in the shoulder of Unit 02 and brought it down into the angel. Though the knife did stab directly into the angel, it didn't seem to leave any visible wound, and next second, the knife slowly disintegrated before Kaoru's eyes.  
他迅速避开天使，抓住二号机肩上的程序刀，将其刺入天使体内。尽管刀确实直接刺入了天使，却似乎没有留下任何可见的伤口，下一秒，刀在 Kaoru 眼前缓缓分解。

'Well nobody said this would be easy I suppose,' he thought somewhat snidely.  
'好吧，没人说过这会容易，我想，'他有些刻薄地想道。

Jumping backwards, he skidding across the earth, creating large tracks in the earth that looked like a hundred foot bulldozers had rolled over the spot.  
他向后一跃，滑过地面，留下深深的痕迹，仿佛百尺长的推土机刚刚碾过这里。

'I suppose I can't use both the Eva's AT-field and my own, since that would give everything away instantly.'  
'我想我不能同时使用 EVA 的 AT 力场和自己的，那样会立刻暴露一切。'

Dodging the angel which almost seemed like a whitish blur now, he said over the intercom at Misato, "I can't get any closer at this rate with another of these things."  
他躲避着那几乎变成一片白色模糊的天使，通过内部通讯对美里说：“照这样下去，我没法再靠近另一个了。”

Misato bit her lip in frustration, unable to decide on a course of action. They had two of these things to contend with, while all the time Unit 00's situation deteriorated slowly.  
美里咬着嘴唇，感到无比沮丧，无法决定下一步行动。他们要对付两个这样的东西，而与此同时，零号机的状况却在慢慢恶化。

"If I may make a bold suggestion, have Shinji-kun launch in Unit 01. With both of us, one can distract while the other helps Unit 00."  
“如果我可以大胆建议的话，让真嗣君启动初号机。我们两人一起，一个可以分散注意力，另一个则去帮助零号机。”

"Yes but...I don't have the authority to..." Misato then looked above her where Gendo Ikari sat with his hands clasped together as though thinking. Kozo however, who stood beside him, bent down and whispered something in his ears. Listening intently, Gendo mumbled something back which nobody was able to hear, but it seemed he had at least come to a decision.  
"可是...我没有这个权限..." 美里抬头望向坐在上方，双手合十仿佛在沉思的碇源堂。然而，站在他身边的葛城则弯下腰，在他耳边低语了几句。碇源堂专注地听着，随后低声回应了些什么，虽然无人能听见，但似乎他至少做出了一个决定。

"Very well, I give permission now to release the freeze placed over Unit 01."  
"很好，我现在允许解除对初号机的冻结。"

"Shinji did you-" "真嗣，你有没有..."

"Got it," said Shinji who admittedly had been listening anxiously the entire time.  
"明白了，" 真嗣说道，不可否认他一直紧张地听着。

"Then proceed to elevator shaft three," said Misato hurriedly. "Unit 01 will hold off the remnant of the angel while Unit 02 assists Unit 00 in the extraction of the angel. Time until Unit 00 goes silent?"  
"那就前往三号电梯井，" 美里急忙说道。"零号机将牵制天使的残余部分，而二号机协助零号机进行天使的回收。零号机静默时间还有多久？"

"Three minutes." "三分钟。"

Misato bit her lip furiously. Three minutes until all activity in Unit 00 stopped functioning.  
美里狠狠地咬着嘴唇。距离零号机所有活动停止运作还有三分钟。

"Shinji don't forget about the AT-field. The angel can erode them"  
“真嗣，别忘了 AT 力场。使徒能侵蚀它们。”

'Like I didn't already know that,' thought Shinji as he was sent flying up towards the battlefield.  
“好像我不知道似的，”真嗣想着，被抛向战场。

Asuka sat in a corner of Nerv all by herself. Almost all personal not directly associated with assisting during the battles had been evacuated to shelters as safety procedures required, meaning that since she had left the command center she hadn't seen a single soul, and she was now feeling extremely lonely. But how could Misato have done that, letting another person pilot her Eva? It was down right unacceptable. What had they thought? That she was too damaged mentally to be able to pilot ever again?  
明日香独自坐在 NERV 的一个角落里。几乎所有不直接参与战斗辅助的人员都已按照安全程序撤离到避难所，这意味着自从她离开指挥中心后，她连一个人影都没见到，现在感到极度孤独。但美里怎么能那样做，让另一个人驾驶她的 EVA 呢？这简直无法接受。他们是怎么想的？难道认为她精神受损严重，再也无法驾驶了吗？

'Its the fourth child...whatever the hell his name is; the other one already has his own,' thought Asuka savagely. 'I swear I'm going to drown him in a pool of his blood after this. And _he's_ my classmate. God!'  
'这是第四适格者……管他叫什么名字；另一个已经有自己的 EVA 了，'明日香恶狠狠地想。'我发誓，这次之后我要把他淹没在自己的血泊中。而且他还是我的同班同学。天哪！'

Even so, she felt a little remorseful in the way she had been rude to Misato. Misato after all let her stay at her apartment, and she was really the only person Asuka knew when she came from Germany, having met Misato several times before then.  
尽管如此，她对自己对美里的粗鲁态度感到有些内疚。毕竟，美里让她住在她的公寓里，而且当她从德国来时，美里是她唯一认识的人，之前她们已经见过几次面了。

'Maybe I should apologize.'  
'也许我该道歉。'

But in truth, she hated this waiting without knowing what was going on. For all she knew, the angel could be disassembling her lovely Unit 02 because of the retarded piloting inside of it right now.  
但实际上，她讨厌这种不知情的等待。她所知道的是，天使可能因为里面那个愚蠢的驾驶员正在拆解她可爱的零二号机。

'Right, I can apologize later, after the battle is over. Right now though, I just want to know whats going on.'  
'对，我可以稍后再道歉，等战斗结束后。但现在，我只想知道发生了什么。'

Standing up, she felt her legs stiffen slightly as she had been sitting in that position for a while. Suddenly though, she felt a vibration go through the floor and wondered briefly, 'Was that another Eva?'  
她站起身，感到双腿因久坐而略显僵硬。然而，突然间地板传来一阵震动，她不禁短暂地疑惑，'那是另一台 Eva 吗？'

---

Shinji flew out into the open sky and for a brief moment he reveled in the fact that he was under the bright blue sky, piloting Unit 01 again when reality came quickly back to him. He saw that Kaoru in Unit 02 had retreated a ways away from the separate half of the angel until Shinji had arrived. Though the angel didn't hesitated to take notice of this newcomer.  
真嗣飞向开阔的天空，有那么一瞬他沉浸在能在明亮的蓝天之下再次驾驶初号机的事实中，但现实很快又回到了他眼前。他看到二号机中的薰已经退到了天使的另一部分远处，直到真嗣的到来。尽管天使并未犹豫，立刻注意到了这位新来者。

The separate half suddenly darted towards Unit 01, intending to fuse together with Unit 01, when Shinji had Unit 01 place its right arm outward, intent on generating an AT-field.  
天使的另一部分突然向初号机冲去，意图与之融合，这时真嗣操控初号机伸出右臂，意图生成 AT 力场。

At that moment, as Misato realized what Shinji was about to do, several things happened. First, Misato yelled, "Shinji don't! The angel is able to completely erode the AT-field. If it comes in contact with Unit 01's bioparts it will fuse with you." Second, Asuka chose to return to the command center at that very moment, just to hear Misato's final words before Shinji generated Unit 01's AT-field.  
就在那一刻，当美里意识到真嗣即将做什么时，几件事情同时发生了。首先，美里大喊：“真嗣，不要！天使能够完全侵蚀 AT 力场。如果它接触到初号机的生物部件，你会与之融合。”其次，就在那一刻，明日香选择返回指挥中心，正好听到美里在真嗣生成初号机 AT 力场前的最后一句话。

But the angel was stopped dead the second it struck the AT-field.  
但天使一触及 AT 力场就瞬间停滞了。

Misato, completely dumbfounded by this, turned to Ritsuko and asked, "What happened? Why didn't the angel erode it?"  
美里对此完全目瞪口呆，转向律子问道：“发生了什么？为什么天使没有侵蚀它？”

"You've forgotten that Unit 01 and its pilot is able to generate the strongest AT-field that we have every witnessed thus far. And also...he reinforced Unit 01's AT-field with his own at the last second. It was the correct decision on his part. The erosion is still taking place, but at a much slower pace. As Unit 01's AT-field erodes, he's able to reinforce the damaged parts with his own, significantly smaller AT-field."  
"你忘了零一单元及其驾驶员能够生成我们所见过的最强大的 AT 力场。而且...他在最后一刻用自己的 AT 力场加强了零一单元的 AT 力场。这是他正确的决定。侵蚀仍在进行，但速度大大减缓。随着零一单元的 AT 力场被侵蚀，他能够用自己的较小 AT 力场来加固受损部分。"

"And he somehow came up with this in the span of five minutes or so?"  
"他居然在短短五分钟内就想出了这个办法？"

"It would appear so," said Ritsuko. "But I don't know how long he'll be able to keep this up. His sync ratio is lower than its been in recent memory. Barely holding at ninety-one percent, at equal level with Kaoru's."  
"看来是这样，"赤木律子说。"但我不确定他能坚持多久。他的同步率比最近记忆中的都要低。勉强维持在百分之九十一，与薰的水平相当。"

'Considering everything thats happened,' thought Misato, 'its a wonder that its not lower.'  
“考虑到发生的一切，”美里心想，“这已经算是高的了。”

"Shinji, how long can you hold the angel off?" asked Misato.  
“真嗣，你能拖住使徒多久？”美里问道。

Shinji's face suddenly appeared on one of the many screens in the command center and several people who had not become accustomed to his abnormal self, gasped as they saw his eyes had turned a blood red.  
真嗣的面孔突然出现在指挥中心众多屏幕中的一个上，几个还没习惯他异常状态的人看到他眼睛变成了血红色，不禁倒吸一口凉气。

"I don't know," said Shinji truthfully, "All the wind was knocked out of me when the angel hit both AT-fields and the erosion is happening quicker than I had expected. Kaoru, can you get to Ayanami now?"  
"我不知道，" 真嗣如实说道，"天使击中两个 AT 力场时，我所有的力气都被打散了，而且侵蚀速度比预期的要快。薰，你现在能去绫波那里吗？"

"Leave it to me," said Kaoru as his face appeared briefly on the screen before disappearing.  
"交给我吧，" 薰说着，他的脸在屏幕上短暂出现，随即消失。

"Time till Unit 00 seizes movement?"  
"零号机失去行动能力还有多久？"

"Two minutes and counting."  
"两分钟倒计时。"

"Shinji...can you?" "真嗣...你能吗？"

"I can hold it off, but I don't know what'll happen after Kaoru rescues Ayanami and I let the AT-fields down. Where the hell is the core in this thing even?"  
"我可以暂时抵挡，但不知道在救出绫波后我解除 AT 力场会发生什么。这东西的核心到底在哪儿？"

"We're working on it," said Misato as she looked over at Ritsuko who was still examining the computers of Nerv.  
"我们正在处理，" 美里说着，目光转向了还在检查 NERV 电脑的律子。

"Right, then I'll-" But Shinji froze as he saw who else was in the command center, and he hadn't entirely banked on her seeing everything. Certainly some of it, but he had figured she'd get furious and stomp off once she learned her Unit 02 was piloted by Kaoru. Asuka instead was staring back at him, entirely focused on his face and the way his blood red eyes were gleaming in the LCL fluid. Misato seemed to notice something wrong also, because she spun around and saw that Asuka was looking up at Shinji, with a confused look on her face. Evidently, she could tell that something had changed with him.  
"好的，那我就——" 但真嗣突然僵住了，因为他看到了指挥中心里还有其他人，他并没有完全预料到她会看到一切。当然有些事情她看到了，但他以为她一旦得知 02 号机是由薰驾驶的，就会愤怒地跺脚离开。然而，明日香却盯着他，完全专注于他的脸庞和他那在 LCL 溶液中闪烁的鲜红眼睛。美里似乎也察觉到了什么不对劲，因为她转过身来，看到明日香正抬头看着真嗣，脸上带着困惑的表情。显然，她能感觉到他身上发生了某种变化。

"Asuka," Misato started, but fell short as she saw that Asuka had taken a step forward towards the screen, her eyes still on Shinji. Though as her lips parted slightly it seemed like she was going to ask him a question, when Shinji severed the connection.  
"明日香，" 美里开口说道，但话还没说完就停住了，因为她看到明日香向前迈了一步，眼睛仍然盯着真嗣。尽管她的嘴唇微微张开，似乎要问他一个问题，但真嗣却切断了连接。

Staying still inside Unit 01 he thought briefly 'I'd rather she had never seen that,' before he turned back to his own situation.  
他静静地待在初号机里，心中掠过一丝念头：‘我宁愿她从未见过那一幕，’随后便转回自己的处境。

Back in the command center, everything had come to a frozen halt as they all waited for the hammer to fall; even Gendo and Kozo were silent.  
回到指挥中心，一切仿佛凝固，众人都在等待那不可避免的一刻；就连源堂和今日子也沉默不语。

Very slowly, Asuka asked, "Misato...what was that?"  
阿斯卡缓缓地问道：“美里……那是什么？”

Misato stood as still and silent as a stone statue, but found that she couldn't keep this from Asuka, because certainly she would find out about it eventually, either from some obscure person, or Misato's own mouth.  
美里如石像般静立无声，但她知道无法长久瞒住明日香，毕竟她迟早会从某个不知名的人或美里自己口中得知这一切。

"That is Shinji Ikari...as his other self...his angel self. We don't know how, or why, but he has angel blooding flowing through him and his own DNA has several small strands of what appears to be an angels DNA. You may have wondered why, when you arrived in Tokyo-3 that the third was supposed to be found around the same time. Truth is...he was, but then we learned of this, and had to run numerous experiments on him. Considering everything that we've put him through, its a wonder he still cooperates. As for his sync ratio...well its holding at ninety one percent, but we've seen him go above four hundred before."  
那是碇真嗣...作为他的另一个自我...他的天使形态。我们不知道原因，但他体内流淌着天使之血，他的 DNA 中掺杂着几小段看似天使的 DNA。你可能好奇，为什么你到达第三新东京市时，第三使徒也差不多同时出现。事实是...确实如此，但我们随后发现了这一点，不得不对他进行大量实验。考虑到我们所让他经历的一切，他仍能合作真是奇迹。至于他的同步率...目前稳定在百分之九十一，但我们曾见过他超过四百的情况。

Asuka had noway of knowing that a large chunk of this was entirely false, and that Misato had made up a part of it on the spot.  
明日香无从知晓这其中大部分是彻头彻尾的谎言，而美里当场编造了一部分。

Frowning now at Misato, Asuka asked, "Why didn't I know about this before?"  
皱着眉头看向美里，明日香问道：“为什么我之前不知道这件事？”

"Because...he's rather sensitive about the whole thing," said Misato, making something up again. "He hates the whole thing, but he also understands that he can help by exhibiting his angel powers."  
“因为……他对这件事相当敏感，”美里再次编了个理由，“他讨厌这一切，但也明白通过展示他的天使之力，他能够提供帮助。”

"So...he can create an AT-field?"  
“那么……他能创造 AT 力场吗？”

"...Yes...and Asuka." "...是的...还有明日香。"

"...What?" "...什么？"

"Don't ask him about it."  
"别问他这件事。"

Asuka continued looking at Misato for a second before she turned her head and said sincerely, "I wont..."  
明日香继续盯着美里看了一会儿，然后转过头，真诚地说：“我不会...”

Misato was rather taken aback at how Asuka had handled this. She had been quite positive that Asuka would view him as a freak, furthering the gap between them, but it seemed as though she had shown compassion, if that was even possible for Asuka as she was now.  
美里对明日香处理这件事的方式感到相当意外。她原本相当确定明日香会把他视为怪胎，从而加深他们之间的隔阂，但似乎明日香展现出了同情，尽管这对现在的明日香来说几乎是不可能的。

'Maybe she can understand,' thought Misato before she turned her head back to the battle. 'Since she herself was considered different by her past classmates and shunned because of it.'  
'也许她能理解，'美里想着，然后将头转回战场，'毕竟她自己也曾被过去的同学视为异类，并因此遭到排斥。'

Meanwhile Asuka was now watching the green and purple Unit 01 as it continued holding off the angels attacks. She had certainly been surprised about the whole thing, especially his sync ratio, which she wasn't entirely thrilled at. But she also felt that a part of her thought he was different from the moment she saw him. He had looked liked any boy she had ever met before, and if they had passed on the street she wouldn't have taken a second glance at him. But he didn't even spare her a single glance, almost as though she was part of the wall. And she had been...what? Hurt by it? That somebody hadn't accepted how beautiful she was, when she herself knew it.  
与此同时，明日香正注视着那台绿紫色的初号机继续抵挡使徒的攻击。她确实对整件事感到惊讶，尤其是他的同步率，这让她并不完全高兴。但她同时也觉得，从她第一次见到他时，就感觉他与众不同。他看起来就像她以前见过的任何一个男孩，如果他们在街上擦肩而过，她不会多看他一眼。但他甚至没有看她一眼，仿佛她是墙的一部分。而她曾经...什么？因为这感到受伤吗？当她自己知道自己的美丽时，却有人没有接受。

'And what was that before?' she wondered. 'He seemed surprised to see me here?'  
“那之前是什么情况？”她疑惑道，“他见到我在这里似乎很惊讶？”

---

As Shinji continued holding off the angel, Kaoru in Unit 02 charged towards Unit 00 which still had the angel perturbing out of the palm of its hand. Most of Unit 00's nerves had by now been fully fused with the angel and large portions of Unit 00's body were oddly disfigured.  
当真嗣继续牵制着天使时，驾驶二号机的薰向仍被天使从手掌中干扰的零号机冲去。零号机的大部分神经此时已与天使完全融合，其身体多处出现了异常的变形。

As Kaoru neared Unit 00 he realized that it would be almost impossible to rescue Rei while keeping Unit 00 in tact. Furthermore, if the angel reached the core of Unit 00, then it could either force the self destruct, or take full control of the Unit.  
随着薰接近零号机，他意识到要在保持零号机完好无损的情况下救出丽几乎是不可能的。此外，如果天使触及零号机的核心，那么它可能会迫使机体自毁，或是完全控制零号机。

'Who would have guessed brother would have been so difficult to deal with. And he's usually rather shy,' thought Kaoru as he prepared to sever the right arm of Unit 00 with Unit 02's AT-field. If he was able to use his own AT-field, the battle would be over in seconds. Be that as it may, as he was about to bring the arm of Unit 02 down, the angel suddenly seemed to twist around and look at him, as though it new what he was. At this last instant, Kaoru hesitated ever so slightly, giving the angel time to move.  
'谁能想到哥哥会如此难以对付。他平时可是相当害羞的。' 当真嗣准备用零号机的 AT 力场切断二号机的右臂时，他这样想着。如果他能使用自己的 AT 力场，战斗几秒钟就能结束。尽管如此，就在他即将挥下二号机的手臂时，那使徒突然仿佛扭转身子看向他，似乎知道他的身份。在这最后一刻，真嗣犹豫了那么一瞬，给了使徒移动的时间。

The end of the angel that was still perturbing out of Unit 00 suddenly elongated and shot forward, constantly expanding its reach until it reached Unit 02. Kaoru, realizing his brief feelings of remorse over his brother that he had felt moments ago, swore slightly and barely managed to miss the angel as it shot just under Unit 02's left arm. However Unit 02 didn't seem to be its target as it continued elongating, soaring towards Unit 01. As Shinji saw this happening, he had just enough time to register what was going to happen as the angel suddenly seemed to swallow the smaller split off version of itself, and crashed against the AT-field. Almost immediately, Shinji felt Unit 01's AT-field erode and he suddenly dashed backwards as he felt his own AT-field being eroded. He didn't want to think what would happen if he lost his own AT-field.  
从零号机中仍不安分伸出的使徒之尾突然拉长，猛地向前射出，不断扩大其触及范围，直至抵达二号机。察觉到自己片刻前对兄长产生的悔意，薰轻声咒骂，险险避开了使徒，那尾巴恰好从二号机左臂下方掠过。然而，二号机似乎并非其目标，尾巴继续延伸，直扑向初号机。当真嗣目睹这一幕时，他仅来得及意识到即将发生的事——使徒突然吞噬了分裂出的较小部分，猛烈撞击 AT 力场。几乎同时，真嗣感到初号机的 AT 力场开始瓦解，他急忙后退，感受到自身 AT 力场也在被侵蚀。他不敢想象，若失去自己的 AT 力场会发生什么。

The angel continued soaring after him, twisting every direction that Shinji tried.  
使徒继续紧追不舍，无论真嗣尝试何种方向，它都能灵活转向。

"Misato!" he yelled suddenly, ignoring Asuka's presence. "How much time does Ayanami have!"  
“美里！”他突然喊道，忽略了明日香的存在。“绫波还有多少时间！”

"Just under a minute, but the life support systems have failed earlier then expected and over eighty percent of Unit 00 has been fused with the angel."  
“仅剩不到一分钟，但生命维持系统比预期更早失效，零号机已有超过百分之八十与使徒融合。”

"Damn it!" Shinji swore. "Kaoru, get Ayanami out of there if you have to rip off the entry plug."  
“该死！”真嗣咒骂道，“薰，如果必要的话，把绫波从插入栓里拽出来！”

"On it said," said Kaoru, as he dashed forward towards Unit 00. Though just as he stretched out Unit 02's arm, part of the angel branched off of the main body, and the previous split off piece of the angel that Shinji had been battling flew towards Kaoru, still connected to the main body.  
“正在行动。”薰回应道，随即向零号机冲去。然而就在他伸出二号机的手臂时，使徒的一部分从主体分离，之前被真嗣战斗的那块使徒碎片仍与主体相连，朝薰飞来。

"Tch." "啧。"

Kaoru had Unit 02 stretch out both its arms and generate an AT-field then, barely managing to hold back the branched off part of the angel.  
薰让二号机伸出双臂，生成 AT 力场，勉强挡住了天使的分支部分。

"I can't get any closer than this!" yelled Kaoru.  
"我无法再靠近了！" 薰大喊道。

Shinji swore again as he had Unit 01 duck under the angels attack. Following up with this, he ran in a parallel line directly to the left of the angels body. The angel them seemed to almost reel itself in, as the main body suddenly retracted so that it could catch Shinji and Unit 01 before he reached Rei and Unit 00.  
真嗣再次咒骂着，让初号机低头躲过了使徒的攻击。紧接着，他沿着与使徒身体平行的方向，径直向左疾跑。使徒似乎意识到了什么，主体突然收缩，试图在真嗣和初号机接近绫波和零号机之前截住他们。

"Forty-five seconds," said Misato's anxious voice.  
“四十五秒，”美里焦急的声音传来。

"Damn it," yelled Shinji again as he stretched out Unit 01's right arm to Unit 00, but suddenly his entire body was jerked backward.  
“该死，”真嗣再次大喊，他试图将初号机的右臂伸向零号机，但突然间整个机体被猛地向后拽去。

"What the he-AHHHHHHHH" “搞什么鬼——啊啊啊啊啊啊！”

Suddenly Shinji screamed as though his insides were set on fire. The angel had managed to grab ahold of Unit 01's torso, and just like it had done with Unit 00, it seemed to pass directly through the armor and flesh of Unit 01, starting to fuse with it.  
突然间，真嗣尖叫起来，仿佛内脏被点燃了一般。使徒成功抓住了初号机的躯干，就像对待零号机那样，它似乎直接穿透了初号机的装甲和肉体，开始与之融合。

It started from his middle and seared through his lower body, just as it had happened with Rei. His nerves suddenly bulged outward from his body, clearly visible through the fabric of the plug suit, though in his case, it was much worse then the pain Rei had felt. His sync ratio, though considerably lower than it has been, was still high enough to cause him much pain, as he felt the pain of Unit 01. Any moment he felt as though all the blood vessels in his legs would rupture.  
这种痛苦从他的腹部开始，向下蔓延至下半身，正如之前发生在绫波身上的那样。他的神经突然从体内凸出，透过插入栓服清晰可见，尽管在他这里，痛苦远比绫波所感受到的要剧烈得多。尽管同步率已大幅下降，但仍保持在足够高的水平，使他感受到了初号机的痛苦。他感觉随时都可能双腿的血管爆裂。

"Mi-sa-to!" he managed to say.  
"美-佐-斗！" 他勉强说道。

"Forcefully cut the synchronization down to fifty percent!" yelled Misato. "And lower the concentration of the LCL fluid."  
"强行将同步率降低到百分之五十！" 美里大声命令道，"并减少 LCL 液体的浓度。"

"Unable to...Unit 01 is not responding to any of our commands."  
"无法...初号机对我们的任何指令都没有反应。"

"Thirty seconds until auxiliary power of Unit 00 stops."  
“三十秒后零号机的辅助电源将停止。”

'Now more then ever is the time we could have used the Lance of Longinus,' thought Misato as she glanced up at the commander. 'And we haven't even injured it.' Now looking over at Asuka, who was standing to her right and slightly behind her, she saw that Asuka was still looking up at the screen and frowning slightly.  
“现在比任何时候都更需要朗基努斯之枪，”美里瞥了一眼指挥官，心想，“我们甚至还没能伤到它。”她转头看向站在她右侧稍后的明日香，发现明日香仍在抬头盯着屏幕，眉头微皱。

'No doubt thinking that she would have been better off out there then Kaoru. And I have to agree with her...its almost as though he wasn't honestly trying. But damn it...what are we going to do.'  
“毫无疑问，她在想自己要是代替真嗣出去会更好。我也得承认……他几乎像是不在认真尝试。但该死……我们该怎么办？”

Shinji was thinking this very thing inside Unit 01. He couldn't create an AT-field using Unit 01, and he wasn't sure what would happen if his own AT-field was eroded, for certainly it still kept him who he was. And all the while Unit 01 was being slowly taken over by the angel.  
真嗣在初号机内部正思考着这个问题。他无法使用初号机创造 AT 力场，也不确定如果自己的 AT 力场被侵蚀会发生什么，毕竟它依然维系着他的自我。与此同时，初号机正逐渐被使徒所控制。

"Damn it...what do I do-"  
“该死...我该怎么办-”

Almost in reply, he heard a voice speaking to him.  
几乎像是回应一般，他听到了一个声音在对他说话。

"Shinji..." "真嗣..."

"Mother...no...Ayanami?" "母亲...不...绫波？"

"Yes...right now we are connected through the angel."  
"是的...现在我们通过使徒相连。"

"Ayanami, how much time do you have left?"  
"绫波，你还能坚持多久？"

"...It doesn't matter." "...这无关紧要。"

"What! Yes it does! If we work together we can get out of this-"  
"什么！不，这很重要！如果我们齐心协力，我们就能摆脱这个困境——"

"Shinji...I'm going to reverse Unit 01 AT-field, and hold the angel inside. That should give you enough time to escape."  
"真嗣...我要反转初号机的 AT 力场，困住使徒。这样应该能给你足够的时间逃脱。"

"But if you do that-"  
"但如果你这么做——"

"I'll destroy Unit 00, thus destroying the angel in the process."  
"我会摧毁零号机，这样也就同时消灭了使徒。"

"Ayanami don't! Just wait right there and I'll-"  
"绫波，不要！就在那里等着，我马上——"

Shinji could almost picture Rei shaking her head as she said, "There isn't another way."  
真嗣几乎能想象出绫波在说，“没有其他办法了。”时摇头的样子。

"Yes there is!" yelled Shinji as he pounded the controls of Unit 01. "There has to be! Not again! I don't want to lose anyone else!"  
“有的！”真嗣对着零一机的控制台大喊，用力敲打着，“一定有！不能再这样了！我不想再失去任何人了！”

If Shinji could have seen Rei smile at his words, maybe it would have comforted him slightly.  
如果真嗣能看到绫波听到他的话时微笑的样子，也许会稍微感到些许安慰。

"I'm glad I got to know you better...Shinji," said Rei before the connection was severed.  
"我很高兴能更了解你...真嗣，" 绫波在连接中断前说道。

"AYANA-"

Shinji however gasped as it felt as though somebody had just pulled a hand out of his stomach. Still gasping for breath, Shinji looked up then and saw that the angel was slowly being pulled back towards Unit 00.  
然而，真嗣却倒抽了一口气，感觉像是有人从他肚子里抽出了一只手。他仍然喘着气，抬头一看，发现天使正慢慢地被拉回零号机。

"Whats happening," asked Misato inside the command center.  
“发生了什么？”美里在指挥中心内问道。

"Unknown at this moment. A reverse polarity effect seems to be happening to Unit 00's AT-field. Rei seems to be containing the angel inside Unit 00," said Ritsuko.  
“目前尚不清楚。零号机的 AT 力场似乎出现了反极性效应。丽似乎正在零号机内控制着使徒，”律子回答道。

"But the amount of stress that that'll put on her-"  
"“但那会对她造成多大的压力——”

Misato however cut herself off as she saw what happened to Unit 00. As the last residue of the angel seemed to disappear inside Unit 00 it suddenly twisted into a grotesque shape. The stomach suddenly surged forward as though it was carrying a child and the core of Unit 00 suddenly seemed to exploded outward, as the body of Unit 00 and the angel mingled. Grey tissue erupted out of the core of the Eva and continued expanding upward into the air, until it formed a giant sphere.  
然而，当美里看到零号机的遭遇时，她的话戛然而止。随着天使的最后残余似乎消失在零号机内，它突然扭曲成一个怪异的形状。腹部突然向前鼓起，仿佛怀有身孕，零号机的核心似乎向外爆炸，零号机的身体与天使融合。灰色组织从 EVA 的核心喷发出来，不断向上扩张，直至形成一个巨大的球体。

"Core reaching critical levels, unable to contain the angel any longer. AT-field has reached its limit."  
核心达到临界水平，无法再容纳天使。AT 力场已达到极限。

Suddenly, the core of Unit 00 seemed to implode upon itself as it slowly sank bank down into the chest of Unit 00.  
突然间，零号机的核心似乎向内坍缩，缓缓沉回零号机的胸腔。

"Shinji, Kaoru, get out of there!" yelled Misato just as Unit 00 exploded, engulfing everything within a twenty mile radius. A large fireball erupted into the sky, during which a brief glimpse of Rei, as tall Unit 00, could be seen going up into the sky.  
"真嗣，薰，快离开那里！" 美里大喊，就在这时，零号机爆炸了，吞噬了方圆二十英里内的一切。一个巨大的火球冲天而起，其间短暂地瞥见了丽，作为高大的零号机，正向天空升去。

Every all but disintegrated except for Unit 01 and 02, who's pilots had just barely gotten away in time. Pieces of Unit 00 lay now scattered in the large crater that it had left, covering part of Tokyo-3. Shinji had turned away during the explosion, and now realized that for some time, he had been crying.  
所有的一切几乎都被摧毁，除了零一号机和零二号机，它们的驾驶员刚刚及时逃脱。零号机的碎片现在散布在它留下的巨大弹坑中，覆盖了部分第三新东京市。真嗣在爆炸时转过身去，现在意识到，他已经哭了很久。

"Damn it!" he yelled as he wiped the tears on the sleeve of his plug suit. "I couldn't do anything! I couldn't even help her!"  
"该死！" 他一边用插入栓服的袖子擦去泪水，一边喊道。"我什么也做不了！我甚至帮不了她！"

Inside the command center, the vibration from the explosion could be felt all the way in the Geofront, as the screen in front of them had turned completely white as the explosion had happened.  
在指挥中心内，爆炸的震动一直传到了地底都市，面前的屏幕因爆炸而变得一片雪白。

Misato continued standing, rooted to the spot where she had given her last order, where finally with a trembling voice she said, "Get a team down there...to inspect everything...and retrieve Rei."  
美里继续站在原地，那是她下达最后一道命令的地方，终于，她颤抖着声音说：“派一支队伍下去……检查一切……并找回绫波。”

"She couldn't have survived that," said Ritsuko with her hands in her pockets.  
“她不可能在那场爆炸中幸存，”律子双手插兜说道。

Misato rounded on her and would have thoroughly liked to have slapped her for the remark she had made.  
美里转过身来，真想狠狠地给她一巴掌，就因为她那句话。

Meanwhile, Gendo Ikari sat upon his high seat in the command center. Now leaning towards Fuyutsuki, he said, "Erase all records relating to Rei. We can't have Seele learning about this."  
与此同时，碇源堂坐在指挥中心的高位上。他现在向冬月靠过去，说道：“删除所有与绫波相关的记录。我们不能让 Seele 知道这件事。”

Fuyutsuki frowned at him and whispered back, "You can't honestly expect them to ignore this."  
冬月皱着眉头，低声回道：“你不能真的指望他们对此视而不见。”

Gendo was silent, brooding over his own thoughts. Looking down at this right hand though, which was concealed by a white glove, he felt a strange sense of foreboding."  
源堂沉默不语，沉浸在自己的思绪中。然而，当他低头看向那只被白色手套遮掩的右手时，一种莫名的不祥预感油然而生。

"Shinji...Kaoru," Misato now said, still trying to keep her voice at a normal volume. "...Return...you can both go on leave until we need you further."  
“真嗣...薰，”美里此刻说道，努力让自己的声音保持正常音量。“...归队...你们可以先休假，直到我们再次需要你们。”

Shinji, who was still crying silent tears, mumbled his thanks and turned in Unit 01 back to towards the nearest elevator shaft where a team would be waiting to retrieve him. But alongside him went Kaoru, who seemed to be absorbed in his own thoughts. Shinji then thought about all the times he had spent with Rei, which admittedly, were too few.  
真嗣仍在默默流泪，低声道谢后转身回到初号机，朝最近的电梯井走去，那里有一队人正等着接应他。但与他同行的还有薰，后者似乎沉浸在自己的思绪中。真嗣随后回想起与绫波共度的时光，尽管屈指可数。

'Ayanami...' he mumbled dejectedly inside Unit 01 as his eyes slowly changed back to their normal brown color.  
“绫波...”他在初号机内沮丧地喃喃自语，眼睛缓缓变回正常的棕色。

He then thought back to the last moments before...well, it was still to near to his heart and he didn't even fully understand what had happened. But he was certain he had seen a giant figure of Rei in the sky for almost an instant, almost transparent it seemed.  
他随后回想起在那之前...嗯，那段记忆仍太贴近他的心，他甚至不完全明白发生了什么。但他确信自己曾短暂地看到天空中一个巨大的绫波身影，几乎透明。

'And then,' he thought as his eyes turned towards Unit 02 and Kaoru.  
“然后，”他想着，目光转向二号机和薰。

Shinji had thrown up both his, and Unit 01's AT-fields at the last moment before Unit 00 had self destructed, so he hadn't taken the brunt of the damage. But also..from Unit 02 he had felt-  
在零号机自爆前的最后一刻，真嗣同时释放了他自己和初号机的 AT 力场，因此他没有承受大部分的伤害。但同时...从二号机那里，他感受到了——

'I felt his AT-field,' thought Shinji. 'It was only there for a moment, but it was stifling, and cold.' And the thing that worried him, was it had been immensely strong to the point of suffocation.  
'我感受到了他的 AT 力场，'真嗣心想。'虽然只存在了一瞬间，但它令人窒息，冰冷。'而让他担忧的是，那股力量强大到几乎让人无法呼吸。

'Kaoru...what exactly are you,? he wondered  
'薰...你究竟是什么？'他疑惑着

---

Hours after the battle, and still Asuka hadn't seen him. She wasn't sure why she was looking for him even, and it bothered her greatly. She had wandered the halls after asking where the pilot of Unit 01 was (having already forgotten his name). But Misato had been evasive again, as though she didn't want to say anything. But also because everybody was still feeling the loss of Rei.  
战斗结束数小时后，阿斯卡仍然没有见到他。她甚至不确定自己为何要找他，这让她非常困扰。她在询问初号机驾驶员的下落（已经忘记了他的名字）后，在走廊里徘徊。但美里再次含糊其辞，仿佛不想透露任何信息。同时，每个人都还在为丽逝去而感到悲伤。

'Why is everybody so sad?' thought Asuka as she turned a corner, only to find this hallway also empty. She half expected to find out that they had had a service for her.  
“为什么大家都这么难过？”阿斯卡转过一个拐角，却发现这条走廊同样空无一人。她半是期待地想知道，他们是否为她举行了一场葬礼。

'Its not like she was that great of a pilot in the first place, its just that she followed orders without caring what they were. Well whatever, I never liked her much anyway,' thought Asuka.  
“她本来就不是什么了不起的驾驶员，只是她从不关心命令的内容，盲目服从罢了。算了，反正我从来就不太喜欢她，”阿斯卡心想。

But now she turned her mind to other matters.  
但现在，她将思绪转向了其他事情。

'Why in the hell am I looking for that idiot,' thought Asuka furiously, as she had come to call Shinji, forgetting what his name was.  
'我到底为什么要找那个白痴，'明日香愤怒地想着，她已经习惯称呼真嗣为“那个白痴”，甚至忘了他的真名。

'I remember what Misato said...and I don't intend to ask him about _that_. But...Ahhhh, why am I being bothered over this. Its stupid! I just met him also...well met isn't right since we haven't talked. Ah thats why...as a fellow pilot I should introduce myself,' thought Asuka stubbornly.  
'我记得美里说过的话……但我并不打算问他那件事。可是……啊啊啊，为什么我要为这种事烦恼。真是蠢透了！我才刚遇到他……嗯，说遇到也不太对，因为我们还没真正交谈过。啊，这就是原因……作为同一架机体的驾驶员，我应该自我介绍一下，'明日香固执地想着。

'I'll admit that he did good for a rookie, but I could have done it so much better. Right, maybe I'll even give him some tips. I'm feeling a little generous right now,' she thought with a slight smile. 'But where the hell did he disappear to? Is there someplace that he go's when he's by himself, or maybe he went to his room. Didn't Misato say something about him staying here instead of living in Tokyo-3 somewhere?'  
“我得承认，作为一个新手，他做得不错，但我本可以做得更好。或许，我甚至可以给他一些建议。我现在感觉有点慷慨。”她微微一笑，心想，“但他到底跑哪儿去了？他一个人时会去什么地方吗，还是回房间了？美里不是说过他住在这里，而不是住在第三新东京市的某个地方吗？”

As Asuka thought this, she paused momentarily in mid step and put two and two together, eventually reaching the point of talking to him while enclosed in his room.  
想到这里，明日香脚步一顿，将这些线索串联起来，最终决定去找他，并在他的房间里与他交谈。

"NoNoNoNoNo! Definitely not what I was thinking,' she thought while shaking her head furiously. 'This is simply professional, what I'm doing. I've after all had the most experience dealing with these angels, and this was simply his first battle, so I'm sure that he'd be thankful for some advice.'  
“不不不不不！绝对不是我想的那样，”她猛烈地摇头，心想，“这只是出于职业考虑，我这么做。毕竟我在对付使徒方面经验最丰富，而他只是第一次战斗，我相信他会感激我的建议。”

Suddenly laughing like a maniac, she rounded another corner and smacked heads with none other than the person she was looking for. They both didn't seem to notice each other though, as both fell down to the floor in a heap across from each other.  
她突然像疯子一样大笑起来，转过另一个拐角，竟然一头撞上了她正在寻找的那个人。然而，两人似乎都没有注意到对方，双双跌倒在地板上，面对面地堆在一起。

"Jeez, watch where you're going," said Asuka as she rubbed her forehead.  
"天哪，看路啊，" 明日香揉着额头说道。

"I could say the same thing to you," replied Shinji, surprisingly not recognizing Asuka from the sound of her voice.  
"我也可以这么对你说，" 真嗣回答道，出乎意料地没有从声音中认出是明日香。

"Well sorry for-oh there you are idiot."  
"真是抱歉啊——哦，你这个笨蛋。"

Shinji's head jerked upward at the sound of 'idiot' which he hadn't heard spoken with that type of inflection in a while. Looking up, he saw that the person he had knocked heads with was Asuka, and that she was slowly getting to her feet. Several emotions seemed to pass over Shinji's face, but try as he might, he wasn't able to keep them under control. Soon his face had turned paper white.  
听到久违的'笨蛋'这个词，带着那种语调，真嗣的头猛地抬了起来。抬头一看，他发现和自己撞到头的人是明日香，而她正慢慢站起身来。真嗣的脸上掠过几种情绪，但无论他怎么努力，都无法控制住。很快，他的脸变得苍白如纸。

Asuka looking down at him, frowned and said, "What? Was the battle a bit much for you? Well be thankful, because I, Asuka Langely Soryu have graciously decide to give you some tips."  
明日香低头看着他，皱起眉头说："怎么？战斗对你来说太过了吗？好吧，要感恩，因为我，惣流·明日香·兰格雷，大发慈悲决定给你一些建议。"

Holding out her hand now, Asuka waited for him to take it so she could pull him to his feet.  
伸出手来，明日香等待着他握住，好将他拉起来。

"Like I need help from you," said Shinji spitefully, as he slapped her hand away from him and stood up of his own accord. Asuka, extremely taken aback at his personality which she hadn't expected, was having trouble finding her voice. Nobody had ever said anything like that to her.  
“好像我需要你的帮助似的，”真嗣带着怨气说道，他拍开了她的手，自己站了起来。明日香对他的性格感到非常意外，一时语塞。从来没有人对她说过这样的话。

"And could you move," said Shinji, "In case you haven't realized, we aren't the only ones in the hallway."  
“还有，你能挪一下吗，”真嗣说，“如果你还没意识到的话，我们不是走廊里唯一的人。”

It was then Asuka noticed Ritsuko, who was standing to the left of Shinji and had a frown on her face.  
就在那时，明日香注意到了站在真嗣左侧的律子，她正皱着眉头。

"Wha-Whats your problem! Here I try to talk to you as a fellow pilot and you-"  
“什-什么问题啊！我试着以一个同僚驾驶员的身份和你说话，你却——”

"Like I care about that," said Shinji as he turned his head away from her, keeping his emotions in check now.  
“我才不在乎那个，”真嗣说着把头转向一边，努力控制住自己的情绪。

"Idiot. God, I don't even know why I tried. It was apparent from the moment I saw you that you were a complete moron."  
"白痴。天啊，我甚至不知道自己为何尝试。从我见到你的那一刻起，就很明显你是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。"

Shinji snorted, giving all pretenses that he didn't care what she called him.  
真嗣哼了一声，装作完全不在乎她怎么称呼他。

"Well don't let me keep you, Mr. High and Mighty," scoffed Asuka. "If you ever get into trouble, I'll just be sure to laugh and then you can remember that you brought it upon yourself."  
"好吧，别让我耽误您了，高高在上的先生，"明日香嘲讽道，"如果你遇到麻烦，我一定会笑出声，然后你可以记住，这都是你自找的。"

"I'll try to remember that," Shinji replied, pushing past Asuka now, all the while trying to ignore the fragrance that was emitting of her strawberry colored hair.  
"我会尽量记住的，" 真嗣回答道，推开明日香，同时努力忽略她草莓色头发散发出的香气。

Turning towards his retreating back, Asuka was determined to get the last word in.  
转向他离去的背影，明日香决心要最后说上一句。

"Oi, don't just ignore me like that!"  
"喂，别就这样无视我！"

"I'll ignore you anyway I want," replied Shinji, feeling actual anger. God, couldn't Asuka get the hint?  
"我想怎么无视你就怎么无视你，" 真嗣回答道，感到真正的愤怒。天啊，明日香难道就不能领会到吗？

Not used to being ignored this much by somebody, Asuka yelled back, "Baka, Jerk, Moron, I hope you go to hell."  
不习惯被某人如此忽视，明日香大声回敬道："笨蛋，混蛋，白痴，我希望你下地狱。"

"Theres a good chance of that," said Shinji now, and meaning it. He was even shocked that it had come out of his mouth, but he continued anyway.  
"那很有可能，" 真嗣现在说道，并且是认真的。他甚至对自己说出口的话感到震惊，但还是继续说了下去。

"Unlike you, I've killed another human being."  
“不像你，我杀过人。”

Asuka blinked several times in surprise to this statement, but she nonetheless retorted fiery, "What the hell would you know about me! You don't know a God damn thing about me! So don't go spouting that kind of shit!"  
听到这话，明日香惊讶地眨了好几下眼，随即火冒三丈地反驳道：“你他妈的懂我什么！你对我一无所知！别在那儿胡说八道！”

Shinji stood in the hallway for a second, with his back turned to her, until he finally turned his head towards her and said, "No, I don't know about you, nor do I care. We are fellow Evangelion pilots, but I don't even see us as comrades. You're sync ratings can't even come close to matching mine."  
真嗣在走廊里背对着她站了一会儿，最终扭过头对她说：“不，我不了解你，也不在乎。我们虽同为 EVA 驾驶员，但我甚至不认为我们是战友。你的同步率根本无法与我匹敌。”

Asuka had had quite enough of this brats insensitive talk, and so she strode up to him and drew her hand back, intending to smack him, when he caught it just before she struck him. For a moment, she was surprised at how strong he was, but her surprise gave way to anger.  
明日香已经受够了这小鬼的无礼之言，于是她大步走向他，挥手准备扇他一巴掌，却在击中前被他一把抓住。一时间，她惊讶于他的力量，但随即怒火取代了惊讶。

"Let me go," snarled Asuka directly into Shinji's face.  
“放开我，”明日香对着真嗣的脸咆哮道。

Shinji stared back into Asuka's blue eyes, all the while glaring at her, but he felt something stir within him.  
真嗣回瞪着明日香蓝色的眼睛，始终怒视着她，但内心却有什么东西被触动了。

'What am I doing?' he thought suddenly.  
'我这是在干什么？' 他突然想到。

Turning his head away from her, he dropped his gaze to the floor and let the hand that he had become so familiar with, drop out of his grasp. Asuka was rather surprised as she could almost feel the fight evaporate out. Certainly his strength seemed to have left him. Looking back at him now, she was almost curious about what he was thinking about. Taking several steps back now, she continued looking at him with a quizzical expression on her face, when suddenly Shinji turned away from him.  
他转过头避开她，目光垂向地板，那只他已熟悉无比的手，也从他的掌握中滑落。明日香颇为惊讶，她几乎能感觉到他的斗志在消散。显然，他的力量似乎已经离他而去。现在再看向他，她几乎好奇他在想些什么。她后退了几步，脸上带着疑惑的表情继续看着他，突然间，真嗣转过身去。

'Tch, fucking jer-' '切，该死的混蛋——'

"Sorry," Shinji mumbled with his back turned to her and his hands deep in his pockets. "But its not smart to directly associate with me, as I'm sure you saw today."  
"对不起，" 真嗣咕哝着，背对着她，双手深深插在口袋里。"但直接和我扯上关系并不明智，我相信你今天已经看到了。"

"Whatever," Asuka said with her arms folded in front of her chest now, looking at him with her peripheral vision. "And I don't care about that shit I saw earlier either."  
"随你怎么说，" 明日香双臂交叉在胸前，用眼角余光看着他。"我也不在乎之前看到的那些破事。"

Shinji couldn't tell Asuka how much that meant to him.  
真嗣无法告诉明日香，这番话对他意味着多少。

"Ritsuko," he suddenly said, "we should get going if you plan to show me what you promised."  
"律子," 他突然说道, "如果你打算带我看你承诺的东西,我们该动身了。"

"Agreed," said Ritsuko as she hurried past Asuka who had momentarily forgotten about her presence.  
"同意," 律子说着,匆匆从明日香身边走过,后者一时忘了她的存在。"

Shinji now walked ahead of Ritsuko slightly, as if he was the one leading and she was the one following. Asuka continued watching his retreating back for a few seconds before she took two steps forward, and planted her feet loudly on the ground. Hands on her hips, her hair seemed to crackle with electricity as she yelled down the hallway, "Whats your name idiot!"  
真嗣现在稍微走在律子前面,仿佛他是领头的,而她是跟随者。明日香继续盯着他远去的背影几秒钟,然后向前迈了两步,重重地跺了跺脚。双手叉腰,她的头发似乎带着电光,她对着走廊大喊:"你叫什么名字,白痴!"

Shinji step hitched then as he paused with his foot not firmly planted on the ground. Turning back towards her, he smirked and said, "What? You haven't remembered it yet?"  
真嗣的脚步一顿，脚还未稳稳落地便停了下来。他转头向她，嘴角勾起一抹笑意，说道：“怎么？你还没想起来吗？”

Asuka's eyebrows twitched slightly as she said, "Moron. If you don't tell me I'm going to come over there and hit you for sure this time. And if you touch me again I'll kick you in the balls. Besides, I've already told you my name..."  
明日香的眉头微微一挑，说道：“笨蛋。你要是不告诉我，我这次真的会过去揍你。还有，你要是再碰我，我就踢你下体。再说了，我已经告诉过你我的名字了……”

Shinji seemed to think about this for a moment before he shrugged and said, "Its Shinji, Shinji Ikari."  
真嗣似乎思索了一会儿，然后耸耸肩说：“我是真嗣，碇真嗣。”

"Oh right, now I remember Misato saying that. Shinji...huh? Okay then, I'll give you permission to call me Asuka, while I'll call you Baka Shinji."  
"哦对了，我想起美里说过那件事。真嗣...嗯？好吧，我允许你叫我明日香，而我则叫你笨蛋真嗣。"

Shinji couldn't help but scoff at the name she had given him, identical to the one she had used before they had become close.  
真嗣忍不住对这个名字嗤之以鼻，这和她之前在他们关系亲近之前用的那个名字一模一样。

"...Okay," said Shinji trying to put on an air of somebody not caring, but he couldn't suppress the smile that had formed at the corners of his mouth. Turning back away from Asuka, Shinji and Ritsuko disappeared around the corner, unable to see the expression that passed over Asuka's face as they rounded the corner.  
"...好吧，"真嗣试图装出一副无所谓的样子，但他无法抑制嘴角形成的微笑。转身离开明日香，真嗣和律子消失在拐角处，无法看到他们转过拐角时明日香脸上的表情。

'God, what the hell was that all about? And why did I asked for his name? Normally I would have kicked him without even saying anything. Maybe I'm getting too soft. ...Shinji...' She whispered this last.  
'天啊，那到底是怎么回事？我为什么要问他名字？通常我可能连话都不说就直接踢他了。也许我变得太软弱了。...真嗣...' 她低声念出这个名字。

Standing silent in the hallway for a few seconds longer, she turned around, her brightly colored hair swinging behind her and thought, 'I suppose I should fine Misato and head home.'  
在走廊里又静静站了几秒钟后，她转过身，鲜艳的头发在她身后摆动，心想，'我想我应该去找美里然后回家。'

---

"You handled that rather...interestingly," said Ritsuko as they stood in the elevator descending deep into Central Dogma.  
“你处理得相当...有意思，”律子在他们站在电梯里，深入中央教条区时说道。

"I wasn't sure how it came across. I wanted to be rude, and make her hate me, but I almost feel as though the opposite happened," said Shinji glumly. 'Why did she have to show up then of all times?' he wondered.  
"我不确定这会给人什么感觉。我想表现得粗鲁，让她讨厌我，但我几乎觉得事情反而朝着相反的方向发展了，" 真嗣沮丧地说。'为什么她非得在那个时候出现呢？' 他疑惑着。

"Anyways, you wanted to show me something."  
"总之，你想给我看什么东西。"

"Yes, I believe that you deserve to know this, just as you deserve to know about Lilith."  
"是的，我认为你应该知道这个，就像你应该知道莉莉丝一样。"

"...Does Misato know?" "...美里知道吗？"

"She knows about this secret even less then she does about Lilith."  
"她对这秘密的了解甚至比对莉莉丝的还要少。"

"So...what is it?" asked Shinji.  
"那么...这是什么？" 真嗣问道。

Ritsuko stood silent as though she was pondering something, until she finally said, "Artificial Human Evolution."  
律子沉默地站着，仿佛在思考着什么，直到她终于说道：“人造人类进化。”

### Chapter 24: Revelations

**Just gonna say now, that Shinji and Asuka's relationship gets a lot worse before it gets better, as is starting to show in this chapter. I know that after them getting so close, and understanding each other, there's the giant, "well this sucks," feeling that everyones gonna get as this story starts to come to a close. This has been my intention since starting this story, that Shinji and Asuka would finally start to accept the feelings they have for each other...and then in a moments notice lose it.  
先说清楚，真嗣和明日香的关系在好转之前会变得更糟，正如本章开始所展现的那样。我知道，在他们如此亲密并相互理解之后，随着故事接近尾声，大家都会有一种巨大的‘这真糟糕’的感觉。从我开始写这个故事起，我的意图就是让真嗣和明日香最终开始接受彼此的感情……然后在某个瞬间又失去这一切。**

---

Shinji and Ritsuko continued descending into Central Dogma, having left Asuka in the upper branches of Nerv. Shinji had his hands dug into his pockets, and for some reason, felt rather awkward right now. The last time him and Ritsuko had really talked, besides the conversation that led them here, Shinji had been rather harsh with her, and he felt a little ashamed of himself looking back on it. But he was right; nobody could understand how he had felt, as he feels now when he looks at Asuka and the confusion that-  
真嗣和律子继续深入中央教条区，将明日香留在了 NERV 的上层分支。真嗣双手插在口袋里，不知为何，此刻他感到相当尴尬。上次他和律子真正交谈时，除了引导他们来到这里的对话外，真嗣对她相当严厉，现在回想起来，他感到有些自责。但他是对的；没有人能理解他的感受，就像现在他看着明日香和她的困惑时所感受到的那样——

"Shinji, you told me earlier that you had wanted to know more about Rei...correct?"  
"真嗣，你之前告诉我你想更多地了解绫波...对吗？"

"Wha...Oh...yeah," said Shinji distractedly as he pulled his mind away from other matters. "I do...or did I suppose, since that is no longer possible, and I feel like I'll forever regret it."  
"什...哦...是的，"真嗣心不在焉地说着，将思绪从其他事情上拉回来。"我的确想...或者说曾经想，既然那已不再可能，我觉得我会永远为此后悔。"

Ritsuko was silent in response to his statement.  
律子对他的话沉默以对。

"So I have to assume that this is something relating to that, but as for what it is...I have no idea," said Shinji as he finished.  
“所以我得假设这与那件事有关，但具体是什么……我毫无头绪，”真嗣说完。

Ritsuko paused for a second before she said, "This is something which I believe you need to see, as I believed you needed to see Lilith, and if I am going against your fathers wishes...then so be it."  
律子停顿了一下，然后说：“我认为你需要看到这个，就像我认为你需要看到莉莉丝一样，如果我违背了你父亲的意愿……那就这样吧。”

Shinji was rather taken aback at how bitter her voice sounded, and he noticed that she hadn't used the title 'commander,' but instead just said, 'your father.'  
真嗣对她的声音听起来如此苦涩感到相当惊讶，他注意到她没有使用‘指挥官’这个头衔，而是直接说‘你的父亲’。

"...You said before about Artificial Human Evolution...what is that?"  
“……你之前提到过人工人类进化……那是什么？”

"Just as it sounds: the creation of a human being based on artificial means inside of a closed evolutionary environment."  
“正如其名：在封闭的进化环境中，通过人工手段创造人类。”

"...Is that even possible?" asked Shinji with surprise.  
“...这真的可能吗？”真嗣惊讶地问道。

"On a theoretical base it is, since the compounds that make up every human being are easily acquirable and accessible in most lab scenarios. The soul is the problem. A soul has no substance, science cannot be applied to it, but they are regarded as a necessary material in defining a human. That was the problem...but we found a way around that. Shinji, have you heard of Gehirn?"  
“从理论基础上来说是可以的，因为构成每个人的化合物在大多数实验室环境中都容易获得和获取。灵魂才是问题所在。灵魂没有实体，科学无法应用于它，但它们被认为是定义人类所必需的材料。这就是问题所在...但我们找到了解决办法。真嗣，你听说过 Gehirn 吗？”

Shinji paused here and searched his brain. Admittedly, he had been involved with so many things relating to his fathers work that things were starting to become jumbled in his mind.  
真嗣在这里停顿了一下，努力回忆。诚然，他参与了太多与父亲工作相关的事情，以至于他的记忆开始变得混乱。

"No...I haven't," he eventually said.  
"不...我没有，"他最终说道。

"Thats not surprising," replied Ritsuko. "Gehirn...you see, is something like the forefather of Nerv. Your mother and father, Asuka's mother, and my own mother were all personal that worked within Gehirn."  
"这并不奇怪，"赤木律子回答道。"Gehirn...你知道，就像是 Nerv 的前身。你的母亲和父亲，惣流的母亲，还有我自己的母亲，都曾在 Gehirn 工作。"

"...I didn't know that your mother worked with Nerv." said Shinji in surprise.  
"...我不知道你的母亲也在 Nerv 工作。"真嗣惊讶地说道。

"Yes," said Ritsuko in a voice that made it clear that she wasn't keen on the subject. "Gehirn was originally involved with the creation of the first Evangelion until it was transformed into Nerv. During that time, another project was being conducted on the study of human evolution, and even more so, to create an artificial human, and have them evolve as a normal human."  
"是的，" 律子用一种表明她对此话题并不热衷的语气说道，"在 NERV 成立之前，GEHIRN 最初参与了第一台 EVA 的创造。在那段时间里，还进行着另一项关于人类进化的研究项目，甚至更进一步，旨在创造一个仿生人，并让他们像正常人一样进化。"

Suddenly the elevator came to a jolting halt and Ritsuko stepped out first, followed by a rather slow Shinji. But this place...it looked familiar to him.  
突然，电梯猛地停了下来，律子率先走出，紧随其后的是行动相当迟缓的真嗣。但这个地方...对他来说似曾相识。

"This is...the Evangelion graveyard?" he asked as he looked across the wide chamber where giant pits opened up in the floor, revealing the decayed remnants of failed Eva Units.  
"这里是...EVA 坟场？" 他环顾着这个宽阔的房间，地面上巨大的坑洞揭示了那些失败的 EVA 机体腐朽的残骸，他问道。

"Right. Gehirn was the first that attempted to create the first true Evangelion. These are of course the failed attempts at them," she said while gesturing at the giant pits around them.  
"对。Gehirn 是最早尝试制造第一台真正 EVA 的机构。当然，这些是他们失败的尝试，"她一边说一边指着周围的巨大坑洞。

"So how come we're back down here then?" asked Shinji.  
"那我们为什么又回到这里了？" 真嗣问道。

"The place I am taking you to is on the same floor."  
"我要带你去的地方在同一层。"

Ritsuko suddenly turned towards her right and started walking along a narrow walkway that hugged the right side of the wall. As Shinji stepped onto the walkway himself, he couldn't help but shudder as he looked at all the failed attempts at the Eva's around him. It was truly an example of the selfishness of humanity.  
律子突然转向右边，开始沿着紧贴墙壁的狭窄通道行走。当真嗣踏上这条通道时，他不禁打了个寒颤，环顾四周那些失败的 EVA 尝试。这无疑是人类自私的典型例证。

As they continued walking on the right side of the graveyard, Shinji noticed a little further ahead of them what seemed to be a side passage forking off to the right. Assuming that this is where they were going, his assumption was confirmed as Ritsuko turned into the dark passage, disappearing from his sight momentarily. Picking up his pace a little until he was directly in front of where she had disappeared, he looked down a long corridor with fluorescent lights that pocketed the ceiling, but seemed to be failing. Taking a few hesitant steps then, he slowly walked into the corridor.  
他们继续沿着墓地右侧前行，真嗣注意到前方不远处似乎有一条向右分叉的侧道。他猜测他们要去的地方就是那里，这个猜测很快得到了证实，因为律子转身进入了那条昏暗的通道，暂时从他的视线中消失。他加快了脚步，直到站在她消失的地方，望向一条长长的走廊，天花板上点缀着荧光灯，但似乎已经失效。他犹豫了几步，然后缓缓走进了走廊。

After some time had passed however, the corridor became almost completely black, and all Shinji could see was the occasionally wisp of Ritsuko's lab coat in front of him, as though egging him on. Now though, as he looked far ahead of him, he could see a blinding light at the end of the passage.  
然而，随着时间的推移，走廊变得几乎完全黑暗，真嗣只能偶尔看到前面丽子博士的白大褂飘动，仿佛在催促他前进。但现在，当他远远望向前方时，他能看到通道尽头有一束刺眼的光芒。

"What is this exactly...Ritsuko?"  
“这究竟是什么……丽子？”

Silence greeted his words for a second before Ritsuko said, "The birthplace of Ayanami Rei.  
"他的话音落下后，沉默了一会儿，丽子才说道：“这是绫波零的诞生之地。”

Shinji stumbled over his own feet at her words.  
听到她的话，真嗣被自己的脚绊了一下。

"The birthplace of...what, excuse me!"  
“诞生地……什么，请原谅我的冒昧！”

"You'll understand in a minute," said Ritsuko as she stepped into the blinding light and disappeared for a moment.  
“你马上就会明白了，”律子说着，走进了刺眼的光芒中，消失了一会儿。

Frowning slightly, Shinji hurriedly jogged towards the end of the passageway and entered the blinding light himself.  
微微皱眉，真嗣急忙小跑向通道尽头，自己也踏入了那片刺眼的光芒中。

He entered a large room, with overhead lights that looked as though they belonged in the ER of a hospital. The walls were a dull grey color, while what appeared to be strange formulas and algorithms littered the floor and walls. Though on the far side of the room opposite of where he stood, he saw coherent writing on the walls.  
他进入了一个宽敞的房间，头顶的灯光看起来像是医院急诊室里的那种。墙壁是暗淡的灰色，而地面上和墙壁上散落着看似奇怪的公式和算法。尽管在他所站位置的对面远处，他看到了墙上有连贯的文字。

'Artificial Evolutionary Laboratory,' he mouthed. 'But this room...it looks like-'  
"“人工进化实验室，”他喃喃自语，“但这房间……看起来像是——”

"As you have no doubt guessed by now," said Ritsuko, "this is an accurate replica of Rei's room...or I should say, that the apartment she lives in is a replica of this room. This is where she was born."  
"正如你现在无疑已经猜到的那样，" 律子说道，"这是丽房间的一个精确复制品...或者我应该说，她居住的公寓是这个房间的复制品。这里就是她的诞生之地。"

Shinji then looked towards the cold hard bed against the far left wall and the table that sat next to it, filled with an assortment of pill and medicine bottles. Just like in her own apartment, the bed here looked as though it had never been slept it.  
真嗣随后看向左面远处的冰冷硬床和旁边摆放着各种药瓶的桌子。就像在她自己的公寓一样，这里的床看起来似乎从未有人睡过。

"This...what is this? You say this is where Ayanami was born...but I don't-"  
"这...这是什么？你说这里是绫波出生的地方...但我无法理解-"

"You don't understand yet?"  
"你还不明白吗？"

"I don't get what there _is_ to understand. You've shown me a room here that looks as though it belongs in some horror film, and you say that Rei was born here. Why? Why not a real hospital? Who are her parents anyway? I never really thought to ask...and now..."  
"我不明白有什么需要理解的。你带我看了这个房间，看起来像是恐怖电影里的场景，然后你说丽是在这里出生的。为什么？为什么不选择一个真正的医院？她的父母到底是谁？我以前从未真正想过要问...现在..."

"You don't understand yet...even though I've shown you these things?" asked Ritsuko.  
""你还不明白吗...即使我给你看了这些？"" 律子问道。

Shinji hesitated with the question that had been bothering him for a long time now.  
真嗣对那个困扰他许久的问题犹豫不决。

"Who is...Ayanami?" he finally asked.  
"谁是...绫波？" 他终于问道。

"She is...the byproduct of a scientific endeavor to reproduce a human being."  
"她是...一项旨在复制人类生命的科学实验的副产品。"

"But I don't quite understand what you mean by that."  
"但我不是很明白你这话的意思。"

"No, you don't? Maybe not, but there is something else that I want to show you, and things that still need to be explained to you."  
"不，你不明白？或许吧，但我还有些东西想给你看，有些事情还需要向你解释。"

"What if...I don't want to know."  
"如果...我不想知道呢。"

"That is your decision Shinji. We can leave now and forget that we ever had this conversation, or were ever here for that matter. But you are now rooted so far in with Nerv that this is something that should not be kept from you...no matter your age."  
“那是你的决定，真嗣。我们现在可以离开，忘记这场对话，甚至忘记我们来过这里。但你现在已经与 NERV 深深地纠缠在一起，有些事情不应该对你隐瞒……无论你的年龄如何。”

"But why can't you just tell me?"  
“但为什么你不能直接告诉我呢？”

"Because it wont be enough. You have to see this to understand everything. I've already shown you Lilith, and that is still a part of this, and you yourself are wrapped up in all this. You can take it or leave it, and you may be better off without knowing this long kept secret, but whatever you decide to do with this information is up to you."  
“因为那不够。你必须亲眼看到才能理解一切。我已经让你见过莉莉丝，那仍然是这件事的一部分，而你自己也卷入了这一切。你可以接受或拒绝，不知道这个长久以来的秘密也许对你更好，但如何处理这些信息取决于你。”

Shinji continued looking at Ritsuko for a while before he looked around the emotionless room again.  
真嗣继续盯着律子看了一会儿，然后再次环顾这个毫无情感的房间。

"...I'll see everything..." he said while looking down at his own feet.  
“……我会看清楚一切……”他一边说着，一边低头看着自己的脚。

Nodding her head slightly, Ritsuko then turned to a side door that Shinji had not noticed before. Standing in front of it, Ritsuko reached into her lab coat pocket and brought out her Nerv authorization card and swiped it through the scanner that was placed next to the door. After that, she punched in the four code combo releasing the lock on the door so that it slid open to admit her.  
律子微微点头，然后转向一扇真嗣之前未曾注意到的侧门。站在门前，律子伸手从她的实验服口袋里拿出 NERV 授权卡，在门旁的扫描器上刷了一下。随后，她输入四位密码组合，解锁了门锁，门便滑动打开，让她进入。

"This has the highest level of clearance just as Lilith's chamber does. Only myself, your father, and the vice commander are allowed in here," Ritsuko said.  
“这里和莉莉丝的房间一样，拥有最高级别的通行权限。只有我、你父亲和副指挥官才能进入，”律子说道。

Shinji could only imagine the backlash that Ritsuko would receive if the afore mentioned learned of this.  
真嗣只能想象如果前面提到的人知道了这件事，律子会遭到怎样的反弹。

Following her lead, he stepped into another room that from the outset, felt much more open and airy than the previous room did, but what was it...he felt something eerie in this new room. All around him was darkness, even worse than the corridor before. However he found that there seemed to be some sort of walkway that was rather large and had a railing on each side, so as to that, he was rather comforted. From all around him though, he could smell a very ironlike smell. Almost as though he was surrounded by LCL fluid.  
跟着她，他走进了另一个房间，从一开始就感觉比之前的房间更加开阔和通风，但不知为何...他在这个新房间里感到一种诡异的气氛。四周一片漆黑，甚至比之前的走廊还要糟糕。然而他发现似乎有一条相当宽敞的走道，两边都有栏杆，这让他感到些许安慰。不过，他周围弥漫着一种铁锈般的气味，几乎像是被 LCL 液体包围着。

"While the previous room is where Rei was born...this is where she has spent much of her life. The apartment is simply something as a pretense, so that nobody will suspect anything happening below the surface."  
“虽然前一个房间是丽出生的地方……但这里才是她大部分时间所待的地方。公寓不过是个幌子，以免有人怀疑表面之下发生的事情。”

Suddenly from in front of Shinji, a bright orange light glowed outwards, revealing something in the middle of the room. As Shinji saw that Ritsuko had moved towards this object, he himself did likewise.  
突然，在真嗣面前，一束明亮的橙色光芒向外扩散，显露出房间中央的某个物体。看到律子已经向这个物体走去，真嗣也跟着走了过去。

In the middle of the room was a glass cylinder, big enough to fit a human and filled with an orange like liquid. The floor of this room seemed to be made out of some black marble like material. As Shinji stood in front of the glass cylinder which looked like something only found in science labs, he looked above him and had to contain his surprise as above him, many crisscrossing tubes intersected before they finally connected with the glass cylinder resting on the floor.  
房间中央有一个玻璃圆柱体，足够容纳一个人，里面充满了橙色的液体。这个房间的地板似乎是由某种黑色大理石般的材料制成的。当真嗣站在看起来只会在科学实验室里找到的玻璃圆柱体前时，他抬头一看，不得不抑制住自己的惊讶，因为在他上方，许多交叉的管道在最终连接到地面上放置的玻璃圆柱体之前相互交错。

"Is that...LCL fluid?" he asked.  
"那是...LCL 液体吗？" 他问道。

"Yes...the LCL fluid that nurtures Rei."  
"是的...滋养丽的那种 LCL 液体。"

"Nurtures...then you mean Ayanami...used to be inside that thing?"  
"滋养...那么你是说绫波...曾经在那东西里面？"

"Yes," she said after a short pause. "...Shinji, I told you before that the components that make up a human body are easily accessible for scientists like myself. However, it is something known only within Nerv and a rare select few such as myself, your father and deceased mother, that humans were created from the combined efforts of Adam and Lilith. Yet, it is said that humans are the failure of the black moon...Lilith. For humans were formed from LCL fluid, because every material, every compound, every definable substance can be broken down into LCL fluid, whether it be a single molecule of it."  
"是的，"她短暂停顿后说道。"...真嗣，我之前告诉过你，构成人体的成分对我这样的科学家来说很容易获取。然而，只有 Nerv 内部以及像我、你父亲和已故母亲这样的极少数人知道，人类是由亚当和莉莉丝共同努力创造出来的。但据说人类是黑月...莉莉丝的失败品。因为人类是由 LCL 液体形成的，因为每一种物质，每一种化合物，每一种可定义的物质都可以分解成 LCL 液体，无论是其中的一个分子。"

"I know that already," said Shinji, "but I don't remember where I heard it. But what does this have to do with Ayanami. If all humans are formed from LCL fluid, that she's no different then anybody else."  
"这一点我已经知道了，"真嗣说，"但我记不清是在哪里听到的。但这和绫波有什么关系呢？如果所有人类都是由 LCL 液体形成的，那她和别人没什么不同。"

"But she is. The first humans were created by Adam and Lilith, but afterwards we created our own offspring. Rei was not 'born' in the usual sense of the word. She was created in a laboratory, that which we saw in the previous room."  
"但她确实不同。最初的人类是由亚当和莉莉丝创造的，但之后我们创造了我们自己的后代。绫波并不是以通常意义上的'出生'方式来到这个世界。她是在实验室里被创造出来的，就像我们在之前的房间里看到的那样。"

Silence greeted as Ritsuko ended her sentence, however, she wasn't done yet.  
随着律子的话音落下，四周陷入一片寂静，但她的话还未结束。

"Rei was created from Lilith, using the LCL fluid that leaked from Lilith's abdomen. Your father was in charge of all this, and though Gehirn had been transformed into Nerv, shortly after your mothers death, and directly after my own mothers death, he continued working on it in secret. Artificial Human Evolution...the outcome was Rei, created by humans, even though she is closer to an angel, for she has her own AT-field such as yourself. In a way, she is the embodiment of Lilith."  
「绫波是由莉莉丝创造的，利用从莉莉丝腹部泄漏的 LCL 液体。你的父亲负责这一切，尽管 GEHIRN 已经转变为 NERV，在你母亲去世后不久，以及我母亲去世后不久，他继续秘密地进行这项工作。人造人类进化……结果就是绫波，由人类创造，尽管她更接近天使，因为她拥有自己的 AT 力场，就像你一样。在某种程度上，她是莉莉丝的化身。」

"Ayanami is...like me? Part angel?" whispered Shinji.  
「绫波……像我一样？部分是天使？」真嗣低声问道。

"She is closer to an angel than you are. You are a human, though with angel attributes. She was created from Lilith."  
"她比你更接近天使。你虽有人类的特质，却也带有天使的属性。她是莉莉丝所创造的。"

Shinji stared at the glass cylinder filled with LCL fluid in the middle of the room trying to imagine Rei floating seamlessly in the middle of it.  
真嗣盯着房间中央装满 LCL 液体的玻璃圆柱，试图想象丽在其中无痕地漂浮着。

"I'm surprised that you took this so well," said Ritsuko after a few seconds.  
"我没想到你能这么平静地接受这一切，" 赤木律子几秒钟后说道。

Frowning slightly, Shinji said while still staring back at the glass filled with LCL fluid, "I had known she was different, but I didn't know how much. But...I knew that she was like me in a way."  
微微皱眉，真嗣一边继续盯着那杯装满 LCL 液体的玻璃杯，一边说道，“我知道她与众不同，但我不知道她有多么不同。不过...我知道在某种程度上，她和我是一样的。”

"Do you hate her for that?"  
“那你恨她吗？”

"No, of course not," said Shinji shaking his head. "But my father...he used her, even though she believed in him."  
“不，当然不，”真嗣摇着头说，“但我父亲...他利用了她，尽管她相信他。”

"Your father used Rei to replace your mother," said Ritsuko a tad bit bitterly.  
“你父亲利用丽来替代你母亲，”律子带着一丝苦涩说道。

Shinji heard the tone in her voice and was rather surprised at it. Turning towards Ritsuko, he said, "Do you hate Ayanami?"  
真嗣听出了她语气中的情绪，对此颇感惊讶。他转向律子，问道：“你讨厌绫波吗？”

"Do I hate her...yes, I suppose that may be the case. I told you earlier that my mother worked for Gehirn before her death, which afterwards became Nerv. The computers here were designed by her, the Magi they are known as, and I say them, because there are three of them. Melchior, Balthasar, and Casper, each of them were developed based off of certain traits that my mother possessed. They are really the driving point behind Nerv, and if not for them, we would have lost against the angels long ago. However...my mother loved your father, even though he gave no love for her in return, having it all devoted to your mother, and then to Rei."  
“我讨厌她吗……是的，我想可能是这样。我之前告诉过你，我母亲在去世前为 Gehirn 工作，之后 Gehirn 变成了 Nerv。这里的计算机是她设计的，也就是人们所称的 Magi 系统，我说‘它们’，因为一共有三台。梅尔基奥尔、巴尔塔萨和卡斯帕，每一台都是基于我母亲的一些特质开发的。它们才是 Nerv 背后的驱动力，如果没有它们，我们早就输给使徒了。然而……我母亲爱着你的父亲，尽管他从未回报过她的爱，他的爱全都给了你母亲，然后是绫波。”

"...So you hate Ayanami because of that?"  
"...所以你因为那件事讨厌绫波吗？"

"No...I hate her for a different reason," whispered Ritsuko.  
"不...我讨厌她另有原因，" 律子低声说道。"

Suddenly, from an inside pocket of her lab coat, she pressed a button on an LCD type pad. From the outside walls, which had looked black this entire time, orange light exploded outward, lighting the rest of the room up. All along the walls, wrapping around the entire room until it stopped at the walkway, were the same glass cylinders with LCL fluid in them. However in the cylinders were-  
突然，她从实验服的内袋里按下了一个 LCD 型键盘上的按钮。一直看起来是黑色的外墙，橙色的光芒猛然向外爆发，照亮了整个房间。沿着墙壁，环绕整个房间直到停止在走道上，都是装有 LCL 液体的相同玻璃圆柱。然而在圆柱中的是——

"Ayanami..." gasped Shinji as he took a step back, finally startled.  
“绫波...” 真嗣倒吸一口气，不由自主地后退了一步，终于被惊到了。

"Correct," said Ritsuko. “没错，” 律子说道。

Floating inside of the many glass cylinders were identical replicas of Ayanami Rei completely naked. However, something was off about them. Their heads moved from side to side without any perceivable form of thought, while their arms and legs did likewise.  
在众多玻璃圆筒内漂浮着的，是与绫波零一模一样的裸体复制人。然而，有些地方不对劲。她们的头部无意识地左右摇摆，手臂和腿也做着同样的动作。

"This is the core of the dummy plug system, which you have witnessed first hand while battling Unit 03. This is the dummy plug manufacturing facilities."  
"这是模拟插入栓系统的核心，你在与三号机战斗时亲眼见证过。这里是模拟插入栓制造设施。"

"Then...Ayanami is..." "那么...绫波是..."

"The prototype of the dummy plug you could say. But the Rei you know is the second to be created. The first died along with my mother."  
"可以说是模拟插入栓的原型。但你认识的绫波是第二个被创造出来的。第一个与我母亲一同逝去了。"

"But why...why did my father do this? You said it was to replace my mother but-"  
"但为什么...为什么我父亲要这么做？你说是为了取代我母亲，但是-"

"Shinji, your father created Rei as replacement for your mother, but in truth, she is a clone of your mother created artificially."  
"真嗣，你父亲创造丽是为了取代你母亲，但实际上，她是通过人工手段制造的你母亲的克隆体。"

This was all to much for Shinji to take in, but as he took another step back, the Rei's floating in the LCL fluid along the walls turned there heads towards him and seemed to looked straight through him.  
这一切对真嗣来说太过沉重，但当他再次后退一步时，漂浮在 LCL 液体中的丽们转过头来，似乎直接看穿了他。

"My mother...no...that can't be..."  
“我母亲...不...这不可能...”

"It is...your father couldn't bear the death of your mother and created a clone of her, a clone which was created from Lilith, and in turn developed into the dummy plug. The Rei's you see along the wall have no soul, they simply act as programmed. Such is the way the dummy plug works, and truthfully, it is less cruel then having children pilot. But the Rei that you knew did have a soul...the soul of Lilith, the second angel. It is impossible to create a soul, so the only thing we could do was contain it inside a human form. That is who Rei is...and yet I was a fool just like my mother, because I sought your fathers love just as she did, and got nothing but spite and hatred."  
“是的...你父亲无法承受你母亲的去世，于是制造了她的克隆体，这个克隆体源自莉莉丝，进而发展成了傀儡系统。你看到的那些墙上的绫波们没有灵魂，她们只是按照程序行动。这就是傀儡系统的工作原理，说实话，这比让孩子去驾驶要仁慈些。但你认识的那个绫波确实有灵魂...莉莉丝，第二使徒的灵魂。创造灵魂是不可能的，所以我们唯一能做的就是将它封装在人形中。这就是绫波...而我，就像我母亲一样愚蠢，因为我像她一样追求你父亲的爱，却只得到了怨恨和憎恶。”

Shinji opened his eyes wide at that. Out of everything that he had heard today, this was the most ridiculous thing.  
听到这些，真嗣瞪大了眼睛。今天他所听到的所有事情中，这是最荒谬的。

"Shinji," said Ritsuko suddenly turning towards him with her right hand in a pocket of her lab coat. "You told me earlier that I couldn't understand how you felt; that I didn't know what love felt like. That is not true, because I loved your father. But he didn't care for me, and only looked at Rei, the clone of your mother. And so I hated her, and was even glad when I knew that she had died. But that doesn't matter, because she can come back, in fact has probably already come back. Your father was here earlier, preparing another...the third now. Though she will have no memories of the one before her."  
"真嗣，" 律子突然转向他，右手插在白大褂的口袋里说道，"你之前告诉我，我不懂你的感受；我不知道爱是什么感觉。这不是真的，因为我爱过你的父亲。但他不在乎我，只看着你的母亲，丽，那个克隆体。所以我恨她，甚至在她死去的消息传来时感到高兴。但这都不重要了，因为她可以回来，事实上可能已经回来了。你父亲之前在这里，准备另一个...现在是第三个了。尽管她不会有前一个的记忆。"

"Ritsuko...what are you-"  
"律子...你在说什么-"

"Rei is back, probably being prepared right now," said Ritsuko bitterly. "And I've helped with the development of the dummy plugs myself, since my mother also had a part to play. But I don't care anymore! I hate the mere sight of that being, ever since she was only five years old! So I don't care, even if I'm labeled a traitor and killed, I'll erase the existence of such an unnatural thing!"  
"丽回来了，可能现在正在准备中，" 律子苦涩地说，"我自己也参与了傀儡系统的开发，因为我母亲也有份。但我再也不在乎了！自从她五岁起，我就讨厌看到那个存在！所以我不介意，即使被贴上叛徒的标签并被杀掉，我也要抹去那种不自然的东西的存在！"

From her inside pocket, she pressed another button on the LCD screen, and all around them, the LCL fluid suddenly turned a bright red.  
她从内侧口袋中按下 LCD 屏幕上的另一个按钮，顿时，环绕着他们的 LCL 液体突然变成了鲜红色。

"What are you-" yelled Shinji as he looked around, but next second froze as he saw the bodies in the LCL fluid suddenly break apart.  
“你在做什么——” 真嗣大喊着环顾四周，但下一秒就僵住了，因为他看到 LCL 液体中的尸体突然破裂开来。

Flesh seemed to fall directly off the bones, while limbs and torsos were separated from the main parts of the body. Internal organs suddenly floated out from inside the body, creating an even darker color than before. Eventually though, the flesh and tissue dissolved into the LCL fluid, as though it had never existed. All around Shinji, now stood empty containers of nothing but LCL fluid.  
肉体似乎直接从骨头上脱落，四肢和躯干与身体的主要部分分离。内脏突然从体内浮出，形成了比之前更深的颜色。最终，肉和组织溶解在 LCL 液体中，仿佛它们从未存在过。现在，真嗣周围只剩下装满 LCL 液体的空容器。

"You...you..." stammered Shinji as he tried to come to terms with what Ritsuko had just done.  
"你...你..." 真嗣结结巴巴地说，试图接受赤木律子刚刚所做的事情。

"The bodies were of course created from LCL fluid," said Ritsuko with a slight laugh, "so its only natural that they would return to the stuff they were created out of."  
"那些身体当然是由 LCL 液体创造的，" 赤木律子带着一丝笑意说道，"所以它们自然会回归到创造它们的物质中去。"

"But they were still Ayanami Rei!" yelled Shinji as he felt the anger burn inside him.  
"但她们仍然是绫波丽啊！" 真嗣大喊道，感到内心的愤怒在燃烧。

"But can she be considered a human? Certainly what I just destroyed cannot be considered human. They were lifeless dolls."  
"但她能被视为人类吗？我刚刚摧毁的那些，绝对不能算是人类。它们只是没有生命的玩偶。"

"But they were still her!"  
"但那依然是她！"

Shaking her head, Ritsuko said, "You don't understand, you're too young."  
律子摇摇头说：“你不明白，你还太年轻。”

"Misato wouldn't have agreed with this!"  
"美里肯定不会同意这个的！"

"No, she wouldn't have, which is why I made sure she did not suspect anything. But I wanted you to see this before I destroyed it, because I felt that you could at least understand, since she was like you. But maybe I was mistaken. Humans should not tamper with such things."  
"没错，她不会同意，所以我确保她没有察觉任何异常。但我希望在销毁它之前让你看到，因为我感觉你至少能理解，毕竟她和你很像。但或许我错了。人类不应该插手这些事情。"

"Is that why you wanted to show me this? Because of who I am! Because of what I am!"  
"这就是你想要给我看这个的原因吗？因为我是谁！因为我是什么！"

"Shinji, do you know why humans wanted to create the Evangelions?" asked Ritsuko suddenly.  
"真嗣，你知道人类为什么要创造 EVA 吗？" 律子突然问道。

"Of course! It was to combat the angel-"  
"当然！是为了对抗使徒——"

"No, that was not it," said Ritsuko. "Humans encountered the angel Adam, and even though the contact experiment failed, they still wanted its power, because they saw it as something equivalent to God. So they created the Evangelions to contend with that power, but in truth it is just a child's imitation. Humans must always have a higher power that they can believe in; it gives them hope for a better future. The Evangelions, and in particular Unit 01 is the closest thing to that desire. Unit 01 is both angel and human: human for the soul inside of it, and angel for the S2 engine that it swallowed. And then what of its pilot? You could say that you are the perfection that was impossible to achieve with Rei, because you have a human soul, yet you are also part angel. Human Instrumentality...you are the closest being able to achieve that."  
"不，并非如此，" 律子说，"人类遇到了使徒亚当，尽管接触实验失败了，他们仍然渴望其力量，因为他们视其为等同于神的存在。因此，他们创造了 EVA 来抗衡那种力量，但实际上那只是孩童般的模仿。人类总需要一个更高的力量来信仰；这给予他们对更美好未来的希望。EVA，尤其是初号机，是最接近这种愿望的存在。初号机既是天使也是人类：作为其内部灵魂的人类，以及吞噬了 S2 引擎的天使。那么，它的驾驶员呢？可以说，你是无法通过丽实现的完美，因为你拥有人类的灵魂，同时又部分是天使。人类补完计划...你是最接近实现这一点的存在。

"And why is that!" yelled Shinji suddenly. "Thats what I want to know! I don't care about all your theories! I want to know who I am!"  
"那又是为什么！" 真嗣突然大喊道。"这就是我想知道的！我不在乎你们所有的理论！我想知道我是谁！"

Ritsuko looked at him rather mournfully for a second before she said, "As to that...I don't know. In truth, I have looked into as much as I could for hope of telling you, but almost all traces of your past have been erased, which isn't terribly unusual, since both yours, Rei's, and the fourths have been erased."  
律子悲伤地看了他一眼，然后说："关于这一点...我不知道。说实话，我已经尽可能地调查了，希望能告诉你，但几乎所有关于你过去的痕迹都被抹去了，这并不特别奇怪，因为你的、绫波的，还有第四适格者的过去都被抹去了。"

"But not Asuka's!" "但不是明日香的！"

"No, though it is kept under strict security because she is an Evangelion pilot."  
"不，尽管它被严格保密，因为她是一名 EVA 驾驶员。"

Shinji looked at her shrewdly for a minute before he said, "Why did you bother showing me this?"  
真嗣精明地看了她一会儿，然后问道：“你为什么要费心给我看这个？”

"Because deep down, I wanted you to kill me. I thought that you're anger would take over."  
"因为内心深处，我希望你杀了我。我以为你的愤怒会占据上风。"

Shinji was startled at the expression Ritsuko showed on her face. It was that of somebody who has no hope left.  
真嗣被律子脸上的表情吓了一跳。那是一个毫无希望的人的表情。

"I already promised I wouldn't kill another human being," said Shinji.  
“我已经承诺过不会再杀任何人了，”真嗣说。

"Do you think you can keep that promise for long?"  
“你认为你能长久地遵守那个承诺吗？”

"Of course! I-" "当然！我-"

"Shinji...I know that ever since the battle with the angel Zeruel, you have been exhibiting angel powers more often. That blood soaked shirt you came back with, you had been shot in your shoulder, but didn't show any trace of a wound, not even a scar."  
"真嗣...我知道自从与天使 Zeruel 的战斗后，你展现天使力量的次数越来越频繁。你带回来的那件血迹斑斑的衬衫，你的肩膀中弹了，但身上却没有留下任何伤口，甚至连疤痕都没有。"

"Thats-" tried Shinji. ""那是-" 真嗣试图解释道。

"And with Asuka no longer in your life, it seems that you've been changing even faster."  
"随着明日香不再出现在你的生活中，你似乎变化得更快了。"

Her words seemed to strike a nerve in Shinji, because next second he was directly in front of her, with his eyes flashing scarlet and yelling, "Don't talk as if you know me! For all your scientific knowledge you don't know the first part about human emotions! You say you loved my father, yet you don't know the first part about love! Don't psycho analyze me as if you-"  
她的话似乎触动了真嗣的神经，因为下一秒他就直接站在她面前，眼睛闪烁着猩红，咆哮道：“别装作你了解我！尽管你科学知识丰富，但对人类情感一无所知！你说你爱我父亲，却连爱的基本都不懂！别像你那样对我进行心理分析——”

"Shinji...you said you 'felt' before, meaning the past tense," said Ritsuko curtly. "What has happened in these past days since Asuka lost her memories of you? Did you also-"  
"真嗣...你说过你'曾经感受过'，指的是过去时态，" 赤木律子简短地说道。"自从明日香失去对你的记忆后，这些天发生了什么？你也——"

"Don't say anything!" yelled Shinji, spittle flying from his mouth. "I don't want to talk about it!"  
"别说了！" 真嗣大喊道，唾沫横飞。"我不想谈论这个！"

Ritsuko frowned at Shinji before saying, "No, you're right, I won't understand how you feel...or felt whichever you prefer, because I'm not you. But even so-"  
律子皱着眉头看着真嗣，然后说："不，你说得对，我不会理解你的感受……或者你更愿意说过去的感受，因为我不是你。但即便如此——"

"Stop it Ritsuko," replied Shinji while looking the other way.  
"别说了，律子，" 真嗣回答道，同时把目光移向别处。

"The fact that the love you once felt for Asuka is disappearing, doesn't that mean anything to you?"  
"你曾经对明日香的感情正在消失，这对你来说意味着什么吗？"

Shinji felt shell shocked at her words. He had realized it himself, but that didn't mean he had to accept it for what it was.  
听到她的话，真嗣感到震惊。他自己也意识到了这一点，但这并不意味着他必须接受这就是事实。

"I don't know what you're talking-" but Shinji voice broke before he could finish his sentence. Though Ritsuko seemed to understand what he was saying.  
"我不明白你在说什么——" 但真嗣的声音在他能说完句子之前就中断了。尽管律子似乎理解了他想说的话。

"No, you do, because you understand it better than I could. What I want to know is...why? You're memories should still be intact, if what I heard from Misato is correct. So then why are you feelings disappearing?"  
"不，你来，因为你比我更能理解它。我想知道的是...为什么？你的记忆应该还是完整的，如果我从美里那里听到的没错。那么为什么你的感情在消失？"

"I don't-" started Shinji, but no, that wasn't right. He did know, because as Ritsuko had said, he was himself. He had just never wanted to accept it, because in a way, it was even worse than not having the memories. Having the memories only made it more painful to bear, because he had to look at her every day and know that, while he could remember everything, he didn't feel anything from those times. They were just like an empty basin of water.  
"我不——" 真嗣开口道，但不对，他确实知道。正如律子所说，他就是他自己。他只是从未想接受这一点，因为在某种程度上，这比没有记忆更糟糕。拥有记忆只会让它更难以承受，因为他每天都要看着她，知道尽管他能记住一切，却对那些时光没有任何感觉。它们就像一个空荡荡的水盆。

"Its..." he tried again. "Its difficult to describe. At first, I didn't think anything of it, but eventually it felt like I was trying to keep water in my cupped hands, while it constantly fell between my fingers. You said before, that after the battle with the angel Zeruel, that my angel self was starting to become more dominant over my human self. I had noticed it before, and especially after I realized that I can regenerate damaged tissue. But Asuka was like...something to hold that part of myself back, a dam I suppose. When I was with her, I was happy. Even now, its only something that I can barely recall, but I know that I was happiest when I was with her, and I forgot my own questions about who I was, and what I was."  
“它……”他再次尝试描述。“很难形容。起初，我并未在意，但渐渐地，感觉就像我试图用双手捧住水，而水却不断从指间漏走。你之前说过，在与天使 Zeruel 的战斗后，我的天使自我开始逐渐压倒人类自我。我之前就注意到了，尤其是在我发现我能再生受损组织之后。但明日香就像是……某种能阻止我那部分自我的存在，可以说是一座大坝。当我和她在一起时，我很快乐。即便现在，那段记忆已模糊不清，但我清楚记得，和她在一起时，我最为快乐，甚至忘却了关于我是谁、我是什么的疑问。”

"But stuff leaked through nonetheless, and during that day that...it happened, I had shown her my AT-field again without thinking about it. I don't even know what I was thinking. I constantly tried to steer her clear of everything related to Nerv, or the Evangelions, but that would mean distancing myself from her. I found I couldn't do that...because she meant too much to me. I guess it was...our love that kept my angel self at bay, and I say 'our' because I know she felt the same, even if she never told me. Now though...everything is just starting to disappear, as my human half starts to diminish. I keep thinking that one of these days, I'll wake up to find that my eyes just permanently stay red."  
"但那些东西还是渗透了进来，在那一天...事情发生时，我不假思索地再次向她展示了我的 AT 力场。我甚至不知道自己在想什么。我一直在努力让她远离与 NERV 或 EVA 有关的一切，但这意味着要疏远她。我发现我做不到...因为她对我来说太重要了。我想，是我们的爱让我天使的一面得以抑制，我说‘我们’是因为我知道她也有同样的感觉，即使她从未告诉我。但现在...一切都在开始消失，随着我的人类部分逐渐消退。我一直在想，总有一天，我会醒来发现我的眼睛永远保持红色。"

After Shinji finally finished his last sentence, both him and Ritsuko stared at the cylinder in the middle of the room for a minute.  
在真嗣终于说完最后一句话后，他和律子盯着房间中央的圆柱体看了一分钟。

"You said that Ayanami is back?" asked Shinji, not wanting to have to say anymore about his diminishing feelings.  
"你说过绫波回来了吗？" 真嗣问道，不想再谈论自己逐渐消退的感情。

"Back? I suppose that would be the best way to describe it, even though she really never left," said Ritsuko. "What do you plan to do though? Are you going to confront her?"  
"回来？我想这确实是最好的描述，尽管她实际上从未真正离开，" 律子说道。"不过，你打算怎么做呢？你要去面对她吗？"

"I...don't know," said Shinji. "If what you said is true, and that she doesn't remember who I am, than isn't it all together pointless?"  
"我...不知道，" 真嗣说。"如果正如你所说，她不记得我是谁，那么这一切不就毫无意义了吗？"

"I told you that you could do whatever you wanted with the information I had to show you today. You can talk to her, or tell your father about this even."  
"我告诉过你，你可以用我今天展示给你的信息做任何你想做的事。你可以和她谈谈，或者甚至告诉你的父亲这件事。"

"Wont that...harm you though?" asked Shinji.  
"那样做...不会伤害到你吗？" 真嗣问道。

"Most likely yes. I'll be thrown in confinement until the Human Instrumentality is completed."  
"很有可能。我会被关押起来，直到人类补完计划完成。"

"I wouldn't do that, nor would I have killed you, even if you have begged."  
"我不会那么做，也不会杀了你，即使你恳求我。"

Ritsuko looked at Shinji rather curiously then, and seemed to smile slightly.  
律子那时颇为好奇地看着真嗣，似乎微微一笑。

"You may say that you're human half is being conquered by the angel half, but I think that at your core, you won't change, if you can still show compassion after what I've done here."  
“你或许会说你的人性正被天使那一半所征服，但我认为，在你内心深处，如果你在我所做的一切之后仍能表现出同情，那么你不会改变。”

"I don't like it, but nor will I tell anybody about it. I think that you trusted me enough to show me this, so that at least, I will respect."  
“我不喜欢这样，但我也不会告诉任何人。我想你是足够信任我，才向我展示这一切，所以至少，我会尊重这一点。”

"Shinji, you understand what your father is trying to do correct? About the Human Instrumentality project?"  
"真嗣，你明白你父亲试图做的事情吧？关于人类补完计划？"

"Sorta...I understand that he wants to be rejoined with my mother, and for that he'll turn all of humanity into LCL fluid because of that."  
"算是吧...我知道他想与母亲重聚，为此他会将全人类转化为 LCL 液体。"

"That is a part of it, but he also wants humans to understand each other, as difficult as that is for you to believe."  
"这只是其中一部分，但他也希望人类能相互理解，尽管这对你来说难以置信。"

"He should have started by trying to understand me... And I don't think that having everyone's AT-field dissolve is the right thing. The AT-field is what makes people unique."  
"他本应先试着理解我...我不认为让所有人的 AT 力场消失是正确的事情。AT 力场正是让人独一无二的东西。"

"He loves you...in his own way, I think."  
"我想他是以自己的方式爱着你。"

Shinji wasn't sure how he should respond to her statement, so he just kept his silence.  
真嗣不确定该如何回应她的话，所以他只是保持沉默。

"Seele has a goal also though, and that is to become the gods of the new world, and fashion everything as they see fit. The fourth child is somebody who will most likely further their goals."  
"Seele 也有自己的目标，那就是成为新世界的神，按照他们的意愿塑造一切。第四个孩子很可能会进一步推进他们的目标。"

"Ritsuko...who do you think Kaoru is?"  
"律子...你觉得薰是谁？"

"Who he is...I'd imagine you have a better guess at that then I do."  
"他究竟是谁...我想你对此的猜测应该比我更准确。"

"I don't...he's like me and Ayanami, he has an AT-field, more powerful than my own."  
"我不...他像我和绫波一样，拥有 AT 力场，比我自己的还要强大。"

Ritsuko's eyes widened at that.  
听到这话，律子的眼睛睁大了。

"Then he is possibly the last angel," she said.  
"那么他可能是最后一个使徒，"她说道。"

"I thought as much," mumbled Shinji. "But I don't know if I can beat him."  
"果然如此，" 真嗣咕哝道。"但我不确定能否打败他。"

Clapping him slightly on the shoulder, Ritsuko said, "Remember that everybody is standing behind you, even if you can't see them. We may have doubted you before, but we believe in you now."  
轻轻拍了拍他的肩膀，律子说："记住，即使你看不见，大家都在你身后支持你。我们或许曾怀疑过你，但现在我们相信你。"

"Thanks...Ritsuko," said Shinji, meaning it greatly.  
"谢谢...律子，" 真嗣真诚地说道。"

"I have something else that I need to tell you, and I don't understand it completely, but its something that your father asked me a while ago."  
"我还有件事得告诉你，虽然我并未完全理解，但这是你父亲之前嘱托我的。"

"Why, what is it?" "为什么？是什么事？"

"During your week long stay at Nerv, before you and Asuka had your brief vacation time, your father asked me to get a sample of your DNA. I extracted it easily and gave it to him, but I'm not sure what happened after that. That strand of your DNA was of course implanted with an angels, but I have no idea what he plans to do with it."  
"在你和明日香短暂休假前，你在 NERV 停留的那一周，你父亲让我采集你的 DNA 样本。我轻松地提取了并交给了他，但之后发生了什么我就不清楚了。你的那段 DNA 当然是被植入了一个使徒，但我完全不知道他打算用它做什么。"

Shinji pondered this for a moment, but no matter what he thought, he couldn't think of what his father would use his DNA for.  
真嗣对此沉思了一会儿，但无论他怎么想，都想不出父亲会用他的 DNA 做什么。

"We should probably head back to the surface," said Ritsuko suddenly. "We've been down here for almost an hour now."  
“我们或许应该回到地面了，”律子突然说道，“我们在这里已经待了快一个小时了。”

"I suppose," said Shinji as he took another look at the empty glass cases filled with LCL fluid.  
“我想也是，”真嗣说着，又看了一眼那些装满 LCL 液体的空玻璃柜。

Turning around, him and Ritsuko walked back across the walkway and into the room where Rei was born in. Taking another look around, he realized just how similar it was to her room at her apartment. This, more than anything solidified what Ritsuko had told him. But oddly enough, the thing about his mother didn't disturb him as much. It was more the fact that his father had done this, which angered him even more. Rei was her own self, even if she was a copy based off of another human being. It hadn't been her decision after all. And then there was the soul of Lilith, which Rei supposedly kept. Well, that could explain somewhat of her lack of emotions he supposed. But why...it was almost as though he felt that wasn't quite the case.  
转身后，他和律子沿着走道走回那个丽出生所在的房间。再次环顾四周，他意识到这里与她在公寓的房间有多么相似。这一点，比任何事物都更坚定了律子告诉他的事实。但奇怪的是，关于他母亲的事情并没有让他感到那么困扰。反而是他父亲所做的这一切，让他更加愤怒。丽是她自己，即便她是基于另一个人的复制体。毕竟，这并非她的选择。而且，还有丽所拥有的莉莉丝的灵魂。嗯，这或许能解释她情感缺失的部分原因。但为什么...他几乎觉得事实并非如此。

"Lilith," he mumbled, feeling the word slide of his tongue.  
“莉莉丝。”他喃喃自语，感觉这个词从舌尖滑过。

"Hmmm? Did you say something Shinji?" asked Ritsuko.  
“嗯？真嗣，你说了什么吗？”律子问道。

"No, never mind," said Shinji hurriedly, before following her back down the long corridor and out into the Evangelion graveyard. However, as he stood before the elevator that would take him up into the higher levels of Nerv, he looked across the graveyard and in the direction where he knew Lilith rested.  
“不，没什么，”真嗣急忙说道，随后跟着她沿着长长的走廊回到 EVA 坟场。然而，当他站在电梯前，准备前往 NERV 的高层时，他环视着这片坟场，目光投向了他知道莉莉丝所在的方向。

Almost as he looked directly across the many pocketed pits, he thought he heard a voice calling to him, as though beckoning him to come.  
就在他直视着那些布满坑洞的区域时，他几乎觉得听到了一个声音在呼唤他，仿佛在召唤他过去。

'No...I must be hallucinating,' thought Shinji. For a moment, he thought he recognized the sound of the voice, but that wasn't possible.  
“不……我一定是幻听了，”真嗣心想。有那么一瞬，他觉得自己认出了那个声音，但这不可能。

Shaking off his worry, he walked into the elevator alongside Ritsuko, and waited in silence as the elevator shook and rattled, bringing them back into the heart of Nerv.  
甩开忧虑，他与律子一同走进电梯，沉默地等待着电梯摇晃颠簸，将他们带回 NERV 的核心区域。

---

Misato was having difficulties already with Asuka...and they had just arrived home. First Asuka started a rant about Shinji, (or as she called him 'that idiot') complaining how rude he was and the like. Second, she had asked Misato why she seemed to be on such good terms with Shinji, and why it sounded as though they had known each other for a while. Misato had to unfortunately relent and tell another lie to Asuka, making up stories about how she visited Shinji sometimes while the science department was running tests on him. So at least in part, this accounted for times she hadn't been home, which according to Asuka's memory, were quite often. Asuka then continued on, asking about her own Eva, Unit 02, wondering when she'd be able to pilot again and when the next synchronization test would be. Misato, hadn't known herself, leaving most of the decision making up to Ritsuko, and just nodded her head a bunch. Currently though, Asuka seemed to be back on the subject of Shinji.  
美里与明日香之间已经出现了问题……而他们才刚到家。首先，明日香开始对真嗣（或者她口中的‘那个白痴’）发牢骚，抱怨他多么无礼等等。其次，她问美里为什么似乎与真嗣关系很好，听起来好像他们认识很久了。美里无奈之下只好向明日香撒谎，编造了一些故事，说她在科学部门对真嗣进行测试时有时会去探望他。这样一来，至少解释了她不在家的那些时间，根据明日香的记忆，这种情况相当频繁。接着，明日香继续追问她自己的 EVA，二号机，想知道何时能再次驾驶，以及下一次同步测试的时间。美里自己也不清楚，大部分决策都交给律子，只能频频点头。不过目前，明日香似乎又回到了真嗣的话题上。

"And that idiot, after I kindly asked if he needed any pointers, he completely brushed me off, saying that I wasn't even close to his sync rating."  
"那个白痴，我好心问他需不需要指点，他却完全不理会，说我连他的同步率都比不上。"

"Well thats just the way he is," said Misato idly, hardly even paying attention to the conversation anymore, being already into her fifth beer.  
"他就是那样的人，" 美里漫不经心地说，几乎不再关注对话，已经喝到第五杯啤酒了。"

"Why is that?" asked Asuka.  
"为什么会这样？" 明日香问道。"

"Why's what?" “什么为什么？”

"What I just said! Why is that moron like that?"  
“我刚说的！那蠢货为什么那样？”

Misato seemed to drink a larger gulp of the beer than she had intended, and started choking on it. Asuka meanwhile, narrowed her eyes slightly, clearing wondering about this abrupt shift in her attitude.  
美里似乎比预想中多喝了一大口啤酒，开始呛咳起来。与此同时，明日香微微眯起眼睛，对这突如其来的态度转变感到疑惑。

Getting herself under control though, Misato said after a few seconds of thought, "I suppose part of it is because of his father."  
尽管如此，经过几秒钟的思考，美里控制住了自己，说道：“我想一部分原因是因为他的父亲。”

"The commander? It seemed like they didn't really get along very well."  
“指挥官？他们看起来相处得并不融洽。”

"Thats putting it mildly," said Misato. "Shinji hates his father."  
“这么说还算客气了，”美里说，“真嗣恨他的父亲。”

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because he abandoned him when he was only a kid," said Misato, getting rather carried away.  
"因为他那时还只是个孩子就抛弃了他，" 美里说道，情绪有些激动。

"He did?" asked Asuka rather surprised, not expecting this sort of reply.  
"他真的这么做了？" 明日香颇为惊讶地问道，没想到会听到这样的回答。

"Yeah, sorta the same as your own father," said Misato, any clear sign of a thought process already slipping. However, this seemed to shut Asuka's mouth almost instantly. Misato noticed this though, and looked at Asuka who was trembling ever so slightly now. Putting down her can of beer, she said, "Sorry...I shouldn't have said that."  
"是啊，有点像你自己的父亲那样，" 美里说道，明显的思考迹象已经消失。然而，这似乎让明日香立刻闭上了嘴。美里注意到了这一点，看着明日香现在微微颤抖的样子。她放下手中的啤酒罐，说道："对不起...我不该说这些的。"

"Its fine," said Asuka standing up so abruptly that the kitchen chair she was sitting in fell over.  
"没事的，" 明日香猛地站起来，以至于她坐的厨房椅子都翻倒了。

"Asuka wait I-" "明日香等等我——"

However, Asuka had already retreated to her room and closed the door with a snap.  
然而，明日香已经退回她的房间，砰地一声关上了门。

'Damn it,' thought Misato as she put the can of beer down on the table. Covering her head with her hands, she thought, 'I can't do this by myself. And dinner is rather...' She didn't even know what to do as far as that went. It seemed that Asuka's pickiness when it came to food had not subsided in the least.  
“该死，”美里想着，把啤酒罐放在桌上。她双手抱头，心想，“我一个人应付不来。而且晚餐也相当……”她甚至不知道该如何着手。似乎明日香对食物的挑剔丝毫未减。

'What am I going to do?' she wondered.  
“我该怎么办？”她暗自思索。

Asuka was wondering that very same thing in her room which she had vacated to. Misato's words had stung her greatly, because she didn't want to have to think about...that person. And yet she recalled Misato mentioning...that person before, when she had been listening at the door at the Nerv hospital ward. Well, maybe she'd ask her about it later. But what Misato had said about that idiot and his father had surprised her, because she had immediately thought about her own situation with...somebody who she wished she'd never have to meet again. So in a way, they were alike, as odd as that sounded to her. But they were so different at the same time, excluding the whole angel thing, which she found she didn't give two shits about.  
明日香在她腾出的房间里也在思考同样的问题。美里的话深深刺痛了她，因为她不想去想……那个人。然而她记得美里之前提到过……那个人，就在她偷听 NERV 医院病房时。或许晚点她会问美里。但美里关于那个白痴和他父亲的话让她惊讶，因为她立刻想到了自己和……某个她希望永远不必再见的人的情况。所以在某种程度上，她们很相似，尽管这听起来很奇怪。但同时她们又如此不同，除了天使那件事，她发现自己对此毫不在意。

"Ahhhh, why am I thinking about this so much," she mumbled, as she pressed her face closer to the pillow. "Its not like I care about that idiot either way."  
“啊，我为什么要想这么多，”她喃喃自语，将脸更紧地埋进枕头里。“反正我也不在乎那个笨蛋。”

'Then why did you seek him out in the first place?' asked a small voice in her head.  
“那你一开始为什么要找他？”她脑海中一个小小的声音问道。

'Purely professional,' was her harsh reply. 'Thats it!'  
“纯粹是职业上的，”她严厉地回答。“就是这样！”

'Then what of the headaches?'  
'那头痛的问题呢？'

'Big deal! People get headaches all the time.'  
'多大点事儿！人们时不时都会头疼。'

'But as often as this?'  
'但像这样频繁吗？'

'Shut up! I don't want to hear any of this.'  
'闭嘴！我不想听这些。'

Pushing herself off her pillow, she walked quickly to her door and threw it opened, only to have it bounce back and almost smack against her right shoulder.  
她从枕头上撑起身，快步走向房门，猛地拉开，却见门反弹回来，差点撞到她的右肩。

"Misato I'm taking a shower!" she barked. However, Misato seemed not to realize that she was yelling at her, since she was talking on the phone.  
“美里，我要洗澡了！”她厉声说道。然而，美里似乎并未意识到她在对她吼，因为她正在打电话。

'Probably to Ritsuko or whoever that guys name was that she dated in college,' thought Asuka. The only reason that Asuka bothered telling her this, was because Misato had walked into the bathroom several times while Asuka had been taking a shower. This, was a memory that was very clear to her.  
'大概是理津子，或者是她在大学里交往的那个家伙的名字吧，'明日香心想。她之所以会告诉美里这些，只是因为美里几次在她洗澡时闯进浴室。这一幕，对她来说记忆犹新。

'Just as long as she doesn't bother me,' thought Asuka, as she walked into the bathroom, closing the sliding door as she went.  
'只要她不打扰我就好，'明日香一边想着，一边走进浴室，随手拉上了滑动门。

"I suppose that I've gotten used to bedrooms without locks on them, but bathrooms without them? Is there no sense of privacy among Japanese people?" she mumbled as she closed the door, wishing certainly not for the last that a lock could be installed on the door.  
“我想我已经习惯了没有锁的卧室，但浴室也没有锁？日本人对隐私就这么不在乎吗？”她一边关门一边喃喃自语，真心希望这不是最后一次，能在门上装个锁。

Walking across the marmoleum floor, she pulled off the clothes she had been wearing and tossed them all in a pile, knowing that she'd have to wash them later.  
她走过油地毡地板，脱下身上穿的衣服，将它们全部扔成一堆，心里清楚稍后还得洗这些衣物。

Stepping into the shower, she closed the door made of glass and turned the shower head on, before stepping out of the spray of water, letting it heat up a little before she allowed it to cleanse her body. Pressing her back against the cold green tile of the shower, she drew her right leg up, tilting her knee down slightly while her toes pressed against the plastic bottom of the shower; her left leg, she put most of her body weight down on.  
她走进淋浴间，关上玻璃门，打开花洒，然后走出水流，让水温稍微升高一些，才让水流清洗她的身体。她将背部紧贴在冰冷的绿色瓷砖上，右腿抬起，膝盖微微下倾，脚趾抵住淋浴间的塑料底部；左腿则承担了大部分体重。

Feeling the mist of water hit her body, she tilted her head up to look at the shower head, and without really looking at it thought, 'So he doesn't get along with his father either, huh?'  
感受到水雾打在身上，她抬头望向花洒，心中不经意地想，‘看来他和他父亲的关系也不好，是吧？’

Now frowning slightly, she reached her hand out to test the temperature of the water. Deeming it warm enough, she submerged her hair in it, enjoying the feel of the water as it flowed through her hair and traveled down her back. Opening her eyes now, which she had closed when she stepped into the water, she muttered, "I shouldn't worry about it. We're fellow pilots and nothing else..."  
她微微皱眉，伸手试了试水温。觉得足够暖和后，她将头发浸入水中，享受着水流穿过发丝、顺着背脊滑落的感觉。此刻睁开双眼，那是她步入水中时闭上的，她喃喃自语：“我不该担心这个。我们只是同僚飞行员，仅此而已……”

After half an hour later, and with the hot water tank depleted, Asuka finally stepped out of the shower, and reached for a towel hanging on the wall next to the shower. Wrapping one towel around her body, and running another through her hair, she walked to the sliding door of the bathroom, and slid it open.  
半小时后，热水耗尽，明日香终于走出淋浴间，伸手取下挂在墙上的浴巾。她用一条浴巾裹住身体，另一条擦拭着头发，走向浴室的滑动门，轻轻将其拉开。

"Hey Misato's whats for dinner?" she asked without looking at the kitchen.  
“嘿，美里，晚餐吃什么？”她头也不回地问厨房。

Misato, who was still sitting at the table and now had a stack of empty beer cans in front of her, mumbled something unintelligible and pointed towards the kitchen.  
美里还坐在桌前，面前堆了一摞空啤酒罐，嘴里咕哝着什么含糊不清的话，手指向厨房。

As Asuka then turned towards the kitchen, she just noticed the aromas smell of something coming from the kitchen.  
当明日香转向厨房时，她刚刚注意到一股香气从厨房飘来。

'What is that?' she wondered as she craned her neck further to peer into the kitchen, but only too quickly all the color left her face, leaving it pasty white, and then moments later, turned the color of maroon.  
‘那是什么？’她一边伸长脖子往厨房里看，一边想，但很快她的脸色就变得苍白无血，紧接着又变成了深红色。

"Hey Misato, where did the egg beater go?" asked Shinji as he turned towards the corpse that was occupying the table. Unfortunately for him, that also meant that he turned towards Asuka, who of course had just stepped out of the shower...in nothing but a towel.  
“美里小姐，打蛋器放哪儿了？”真嗣边问边转向桌上那具尸体。不幸的是，这也意味着他转向了刚洗完澡的明日香……只裹着一条浴巾。

One-second lasted an eternity as the two of them stared back at each other. Shinji, who of course had expected this sooner or later, was still not prepared for it in anyway. Asuka was standing in the opening of the bathroom, her hair still dripping wet from her shower. Misato meanwhile, sat at the kitchen table, completely oblivious to the surprise of the two teenagers seeing each other in such strange circumstances.  
那一秒仿佛永恒，两人对视着。真嗣当然知道迟早会有这么一幕，但无论如何都没准备好。明日香站在浴室门口，头发还滴着水。美里 meanwhile，坐在餐桌旁，完全没注意到两个青少年在这种奇怪的情况下相遇的惊讶。

Shinji, not particularly happy about the current situation, opened his mouth to make a crude remark about Asuka's attire, desiring to increase the distance between them. However, he got no further than opening his mouth when Asuka shrieked at him...  
真嗣对当前的情况并不满意，张嘴想对明日香的着装说些粗鲁的话，希望能拉开彼此的距离。然而，他还没来得及开口，明日香就尖叫起来……

"AHHHHH! BAKA! ECCHI! HENTAI! THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE!"  
"啊啊啊！笨蛋！色情！变态！你他妈在这里干什么！"

Her shriek seemed to wake Misato up though, because she suddenly jolted upwards, sloshing the rest of her beer across the kitchen table.  
她的尖叫似乎唤醒了美里，因为她突然猛地坐起来，将剩下的啤酒洒满了厨房桌子。

"Wasrong?" she slurred heavily.  
""怎么了？"" 她含糊不清地说道。

Asuka in response, pointed at Shinji with a wavering finger and shouted, "WHY THE HELL IS HE IN THE HOUSE!"  
明日香随即用颤抖的手指指向真嗣，大声喊道：“他到底为什么会在家里！”

"Who's he?" asked Misato, still completely out of it.  
“他是谁？”美里问道，依旧完全摸不着头脑。

Sighing slightly, Shinji shifted his gaze away from Asuka and turned to Misato.  
真嗣轻轻叹了口气，将目光从明日香身上移开，转向美里。

"She means me Misato." "她指的是我，Misato。"

"Wha? Oh...right...I called you over didn't I?"  
"啊？哦...对...我确实叫你过来的，对吧？"

Shinji glared at Misato, wishing that she would hurry up and pass out before she said something detrimental.  
真嗣瞪着美里，希望她能快点醉倒，以免说出什么有害的话来。

"Yes...you did," said Shinji his voice laced with annoyance. 'And I wish I hadn't listened to you,' he thought silently in his head.  
"是的...你确实做了，" 真嗣说道，语气中带着恼怒。'我真希望我没听你的，' 他在心里默默地想。

"Ah...thats right. I wanted you to cook...so whats the problem?"  
"啊...没错。我是想让你做饭...那有什么问题？"

"WHATS THE PROBLEM!" yelled Asuka. "NO WAY AM I LETTING THIS GUY STAY IN THE HOUSE!"  
"有什么问题！" 明日香大喊。"我绝不允许这家伙留在家里！"

"Well if she doesn't want me here, than I suppose I can just leave," said Shinji making it quite clear that he was loathing just standing there.  
“好吧，如果她不希望我在这里，那我想我可以离开，”真嗣说道，显然他很讨厌只是站在那里。

Walking away from the stove which was still on and cooking eggs, he passed by Misato who frowned at his reluctance to stay. Downing the rest of her beer, she said now with some control over her voice, "Shinji...stay, at least for a little while since you're here. Even if you don't want to cook."  
他从仍在加热并煎着鸡蛋的炉子旁走开，经过美里身边，她皱眉看着他不愿留下的样子。喝完剩下的啤酒，她现在能控制自己的声音了，说道：“真嗣……留下来，至少待一会儿，既然你已经在这里了。即使你不想做饭。”

Shinji stopped just as he was about to pass Asuka and turned around to look at Misato who was wearing a very passive look on her face. Glancing slightly to his right, he saw that Asuka was mere seconds away from decking him in the face. Turning back towards Misato, he said while grumbling slightly, "Fine...I'll cook. But afterwards I'm leaving...and this better not happen again Misato."  
真嗣刚要经过明日香时停了下来，转身看向美里，她脸上带着非常被动的表情。他微微向右瞥了一眼，看到明日香几乎就要一拳打在他脸上。转回美里，他略带抱怨地说：“好吧……我会做饭。但之后我要离开……美里，这最好别再发生了。”

"You have my word," muttered Misato, now going back into the coma that she had woken up from. Asuka however, was not about to let this happen, and retorted angrily, "Misato, are you so drunk that you're gonna let this idiot cook here!"  
"你放心，" 美里咕哝着，又陷入了她刚醒来的昏迷状态。但明日香可不打算让这事发生，她愤怒地反驳道，"美里，你醉得连这个白痴都要在这里做饭了吗！"

"Like I want to in the first place," muttered Shinji, his own anger starting to bubble up.  
"我本来就不想做，" 真嗣嘀咕着，自己的怒气也开始涌上来。

"As if anything you cook could ever satisfy me," retorted Asuka.  
"好像你做的饭能让我满意似的，" 明日香反驳道。

"Fine then, don't eat it," said Shinji. "Its a waist of ingredients anyway feeding your vulgar mouth."  
"那好吧，不吃就算了，" 真嗣说道。"反正喂你这张粗俗的嘴也是浪费食材。"

"My vulgar...What!" "我粗俗...什么！"

Asuka quickly strode over to Shinji with the towel still tightly wrapped around her body, and grabbed him by the scruff of the neck.  
明日香迅速裹着毛巾走到真嗣面前，一把抓住他的后颈。

"My vulgar mouth! You're the one that acted like an ass-hole after I tried being nice."  
"我这粗俗的嘴！你才是，我试着对你好，你却表现得像个混蛋。"

"Do I look like I care?" asked Shinji with a raised eyebrow.  
"我看起来像是在乎吗？" 真嗣挑起眉毛问道。

Asuka seemed to shake with anger and suddenly drew her hand back.  
明日香似乎气得发抖，突然将手抽了回去。

"You fucking ass-" "你这个混蛋——"

"I don't care if you two continue like this into the night," said Misato, speaking up from where she sat at the table. "But do it after I at least have some food."  
"我不在乎你们俩是不是要这样吵到深夜，" 坐在桌边的美里说道，"但至少等我吃点东西再说。"

Shinji sneered slightly in response to Misato's comment, and took a step away from Asuka.  
对于美里的话，真嗣轻蔑地笑了笑，然后从明日香身边退开一步。

"Eat it or don't; I couldn't care less either way."  
吃不吃随你；我根本不在乎。

Turning back towards the stove, he grumbled as he turned the dials of the all too familiar stove. Asuka continued staring at his back though, still shaking with rage over the person that confused her so greatly right now. It only made it worse that he had gotten a glimpse of her without any sort of guard up.  
他转回炉子前，一边咕哝着一边转动着那个再熟悉不过的炉子的旋钮。明日香继续盯着他的背影，仍然因那个让她如此困惑的人而愤怒得发抖。更糟糕的是，他看到了毫无防备的她。

Snarling at his back now, she turned around and stomped down the hallway to her door, before throwing it open and kicking it close with a loud 'bang.' Shinji, on the other hand, seemed to release a long held breath the minute her rage couldn't be felt vibrating behind him.  
她对着他的背影咆哮一声，转身沿着走廊走向自己的房门，猛地推开门，又用力一脚把门踢得“砰”的一声关上。而真嗣，似乎在她怒气无法再震颤他背后的那一刻，长长地舒了一口气。

"You handled that interestingly," mumbled Misato with her head resting on the table.  
"你处理得挺有意思的，" 美里咕哝着，头靠在桌子上。

Shinji was silent as he turned and looked down the hallway towards the door Asuka had disappeared through, and his own room, now used as storage.  
真嗣沉默地转身，目光沿着走廊望向阿斯卡消失的那扇门，以及他自己的房间，如今已被用作储藏室。

"And you don't agree with how I'm handling this?" whispered Shinji, careful to be quiet incase Asuka was trying to listen to any conversation him and Misato may have.  
"你不同意我处理这件事的方式吗？" 真嗣低声说道，小心翼翼地保持安静，以防明日香在偷听他和美里可能进行的对话。

"No, I don't," said Misato after a moments pause, "but of course you already knew that."  
"不，我不懂，"美里顿了一下说，"但你当然早就知道了。"

"And yet you asked me to come here immediately, making me worry that something was wrong. Though of course I learned that all you wanted was for me to cook," said Shinji somewhat bitterly.  
"然而你却让我立刻过来，让我担心出了什么事。结果当然只是想让我做饭，"真嗣有些苦涩地说。"

Shrugging, Misato reached for another beer and said, "As I said before, you're here, so you may as well make the best of it."  
美里耸耸肩，伸手去拿另一罐啤酒，说道："就像我之前说的，你既然来了，就尽量好好享受吧。"

'Or the worst,' thought Shinji as he turned back to the stove.  
'或者是最糟糕的，' 真嗣想着，转身回到炉子旁。

Even though he hadn't cooked a meal for himself in almost a week, he still found that his cooking skills had not deteriorated in the least. Knowing that Asuka wouldn't eat anything other than German food, Shinji had a major problem, because he didn't have any ingredients that he could make German food with. In the end, he settled on something simple: that being white rice with fried eggs mixed with soy sauce. Luckily for him, these simple few things even Misato seemed to carry. The majority of her grocery supplies seemed to have dwindled down to instant meals, bags of chips, and many pop cans. Even so though, he thought that it had turned out well enough.  
尽管他几乎一周没有为自己做饭了，但他仍然发现自己的烹饪技巧丝毫没有退步。知道明日香除了德国菜之外什么都不吃，真嗣面临着一个大问题，因为他没有任何可以用来做德国菜的食材。最终，他决定做些简单的：白米饭配上酱油炒蛋。幸运的是，这些简单的食材甚至连美里似乎都有储备。她的大部分食品储备似乎已经减少到了速食餐、薯片和许多汽水罐。尽管如此，他还是觉得这顿饭做得相当不错。

Placing two plates on the kitchen counter, Shinji walked over to Misato and nudged her gently, as she had fallen asleep at the table waiting for him to finish.  
将两盘菜放在厨房台面上，真嗣走到美里身边，轻轻地推了推她，因为她已经在桌边等着他做完饭时睡着了。

"Hey, Misato. Its finished..." he said.  
"嘿，美里。已经完成了……" 他说道。

Misato stirred slightly and mumbled, "Huh...whats finished?"  
美里微微动了动，含糊地问："嗯……什么完成了？"

"The dinner that you called me over to make," retorted Shinji, trying to keep the annoyance in his voice to a bear minimum.  
"你叫我来做的那顿晚饭，" 真嗣反驳道，尽量把声音里的不悦降到最低。

"Oh right...what did you make?" asked Misato.  
“哦对了……你做了什么？”美里问道。

"Well, you don't have much in the way of ingredients, so its fairly simple. I've no idea what...Asuka will think of it though, since its not German food."  
“嗯，你的食材不多，所以挺简单的。我不知道……明日香会怎么想，毕竟这不是德国菜。”

Misato snorted. She had eaten German food more often in the past few months than any other nationalities food. It was the last thing she wanted to eat right now.  
美里哼了一声。过去几个月里，她吃的德国菜比其他任何国家的菜都多。现在她最不想吃的就是德国菜了。

"What? Did you want German food?" asked Shinji in response to Misato's snort.  
"什么？你想吃德国菜吗？" 真嗣回应美里的一声嗤笑。

"...I'm just surprised you made something that _wasn't_ German food," sighed Misato.  
"……我只是惊讶你居然做了不是德国菜的东西，" 美里叹息道。

Shinji frowned slightly, but remained silent. True, he normally wouldn't have made anything else, but he himself had gotten so used to German food that he found himself wishing he knew a restaurant in Tokyo-3 that he could go to.  
真嗣微微皱眉，但保持沉默。确实，他通常不会做其他菜，但他自己已经习惯了德国菜，以至于他发现自己希望知道东京-3 有没有一家餐厅可以去。

"What is it anyway?" asked Misato as she leaned around Shinji and looked at the kitchen counters where two plates rested on them.  
"这到底是什么？" 美里一边问，一边侧身绕过真嗣，看向厨房台面上摆放着的两只盘子。

"Fried rice with fried egg and some soy sauce mixed in. I could have added some more seasonings, but I couldn't seem to find any."  
"炒饭加煎蛋，再淋了点酱油。我本可以再加些调料的，但似乎找不到。"

Misato hesitated briefly, before she whispered, "I threw them all out after you left. I never figured you'd be cooking here again."  
美里犹豫了一下，低声说道："你走后我把它们全扔了。我没想到你还会再在这里做饭。"

"Neither did I," said Shinji, his displeasure over this entire thing only too apparent.  
"我也没有，" 真嗣说道，他对整件事的不满之情溢于言表。

"Well, whatever it matters...thanks."  
"嗯，不管怎样...谢谢。"

"...Don't worry about it..."  
"...别担心..."

"But you only made two plates. Unless you were serious about not making any for Asuka."  
"但你只做了两盘。除非你是认真的，不打算给明日香做。"

"...If she wants it, she can have it. I made it incase she changes her mind. But I'm not really hungry."  
"……如果她想要，她可以吃。我做这个是怕她改变主意。但我现在不太饿。"

Misato watched him out of the corner of her eye before she mumbled almost inaudibly, "You can act the way you are, and make it seemed like you don't care...but you do still care about Asuka, Shinji."  
美里用眼角余光观察着他，然后几乎听不清地嘟囔道，“你可以装作不在乎的样子，让人觉得你无所谓……但你还是关心明日香的，真嗣。”

Shinji chose not to reply to her statement, his conversation with Ritsuko still too near to his heart.  
真嗣没有回应她的话，与律子之间的对话仍在他心头萦绕。

"You should probably eat it, since it gets cold quickly," said Shinji instead as he turned away.  
“你最好趁热吃掉，”真嗣转过身去，改口说道，“因为它冷得很快。”

"Are you...leaving now?" asked Misato.  
“你……现在要走了吗？”美里问道。

"Yeah. I did what you wanted me to, so I have no reason to stay here any longer."  
“是的。我已经按照你的要求做了，所以我没有理由再留在这里。”

"But Shin-" “但是真-”

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "It isn't right for me to be here, and I shouldn't have even come here in the first place."  
真嗣摇了摇头，说道：“我在这里不合适，我一开始就不该来这里。”

Misato bit down on her lips, trying to think of a reason to keep Shinji here longer. In truth, she hoped that by having Shinji here, Asuka might warm up to him, if just a little, and remember some of her lost memories. Though after seeing the brief shouting match between them just a little while ago, she wasn't too reassured.  
美里咬了咬嘴唇，试图想出一个理由让真嗣在这里多待一会儿。实际上，她希望真嗣在这里能让明日香对他稍微亲近一些，也许还能唤起她一些失去的记忆。不过，看到他们不久前短暂的争吵，她并没有感到太放心。

"I know but...how are things fairing at Nerv?" asked Misato.  
“我知道，但是……NERV 的情况怎么样？”美里问道。

"Well enough," said Shinji evasively. Under no circumstances did he plan on telling Misato about his conversation with Ritsuko and everything he now knew about Rei.  
“还算顺利，”真嗣含糊其辞地说。无论如何，他都不打算告诉美里他和律子之间的对话以及他现在所知道的一切关于绫波的事情。

"I need to get going," said Shinji suddenly as though it closed the subject.  
"我得走了，" 真嗣突然说道，仿佛这样就结束了话题。

"O...kay..." mumbled Misato as Shinji started walking towards the apartment's front door. Pausing momentarily at the door though, he looked behind him and in the direction of the door that Asuka was sure to be behind. Very briefly, his face scrunched up as though some internal struggle raged through him. But next moment it seemed to pass, and he slipped his shoes on, before passing through the door and out into the darkened sky.  
"哦...好吧..." 美里咕哝着，看着真嗣走向公寓的前门。在门口稍作停顿，他回头望向阿斯娜肯定在的那扇门。他的脸微微皱起，仿佛内心正经历着一场挣扎。但下一刻，这表情似乎消失了，他穿上鞋子，穿过门，走进了昏暗的天空。

Misato continued standing in the hallway for a few seconds after Shinji left, wishing that things could go back to how they used to, when Shinji still lived there, and admittedly, when Shinji and Asuka's feelings for each other hadn't blossomed. But things were as they were, and she'd have to cope with the current situation.  
真嗣离开后，美里继续在走廊里站了几秒钟，希望事情能回到过去，那时真嗣还住在那里，而且坦白说，那时真嗣和阿斯娜对彼此的感情还没有萌芽。但现实就是如此，她必须面对当前的局面。

Turning back to the kitchen table, she looked at her hardly touched meal and was feeling her appetite slipping, when she heard Asuka's door come flying open.  
她转回厨房的桌子，看着几乎未动的饭菜，感觉食欲在消退，这时她听到明日香的房门猛地被打开了。

"Did that ass-hole leave?"  
“那个混蛋走了吗？”

"Yes," said Misato without much emotion in her voice, though Asuka didn't seem to pick it up.  
“是的，”美里语气平淡地说，尽管明日香似乎没有察觉到。

"Well good! Just knowing that he was here was pissing me off," grumbled Asuka as she made her way over to the kitchen table. She seemed to have taken the time to put clothes on now, and was wearing a light blue tank top with matching panties.  
“好极了！光是知道他在这里就让我火大，”明日香嘟囔着走向厨房餐桌。她似乎抽空穿上了衣服，现在穿着一件浅蓝色吊带背心和同色内裤。

Sitting down at the table across from Misato, she looked at the fried rice in front of Misato and glared at it briefly. Placing the palm of her hand against the side of her head she placed her elbows on the table and tilted her head to the right as she asked, "So what is this crap?" She was of course referring to the fried rice that Shinji had made.  
坐在米萨托对面的桌前，她看着米萨托面前的炒饭，短暂地瞪了一眼。她将手掌贴在头侧，手肘撑在桌上，向右歪着头问道：“这是什么鬼东西？”她当然是指真嗣做的炒饭。

"Hmmm? Oh, Shinji made fried rice," mumbled Misato almost inaudibly.  
“嗯？哦，真嗣做了炒饭，”米萨托几乎听不清地咕哝道。

"So how come you're not eating it?" asked Asuka with a slight smirk, thinking that it was so disgusting that she didn't dare touch it.  
"那你为什么不吃呢？" 明日香带着一丝戏谑问道，心想这东西太恶心了，她都不敢碰。

"Not hungry anymore," said Misato. Suddenly standing up, she wobbled slightly from all the alcohol in her system and started walking to the bathroom.  
"现在不饿了，" 美里说道。突然站起来，她因体内的酒精而微微摇晃，开始走向浴室。

"What are you-" but Asuka cut herself off when she saw Misato quicken her pace, and next second crash through the bathroom door.  
"你要干什么——" 但明日香话还没说完，就看到美里加快了脚步，下一秒便撞开了浴室的门。

'Oh...that,' thought Asuka as she heard retching noises coming from the bathroom.  
"'哦...那个，' 明日香听到从浴室传来的呕吐声时心想。

Not bothering to hide her disgust from Misato's demeanor, she turned her grimace to the bowl of fried rice that Misato had left on the table. Several different emotions passed over her face as she continued staring at the plate of food. In truth, her stomach was grumbling so loudly that she was surprised the people next door couldn't here it. Even so though...the thought of eating anything that that idiot had made gave her a desire to puke.  
她毫不掩饰对美里举止的厌恶，将皱眉转向美里留在桌上的炒饭。她盯着那盘食物，脸上掠过几种不同的情绪。实际上，她的肚子咕咕叫得如此响亮，她惊讶隔壁的人居然听不到。即便如此...想到要吃那个白痴做的东西，她就有种想吐的冲动。

Walking around to the other side of the kitchen counter, she opened the fridge, only to discover that it was almost empty except for a few beer cans and a gallon of milk which was almost gone.  
她绕到厨房柜台的另一边，打开冰箱，却发现里面几乎空空如也，除了几罐啤酒和几乎见底的一加仑牛奶。

'Damn it,' she thought. 'I guess there really isn't anything in the entire fucking apartment.' She didn't even bother checking the cupboards, knowing that she'd have even less chance of finding something in there.  
“该死，”她心想，“看来这破公寓里真他妈什么都没有。”她连橱柜都懒得检查，知道在那里找到东西的几率更小。

Turning away from the refrigerator, the first thing her eyes set on was the second bowl that Shinji had made.  
她从冰箱前转过身，第一眼看到的就是真嗣做的第二碗饭。

"Not a chance," she said as though the bowl of fried rice was trying to get her to eat it.  
“想都别想，”她对着那碗炒饭说，仿佛它在试图让她吃掉它。

Hearing the sound of the toilet flushing then, Asuka turned as Misato came plodding out of the bathroom, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.  
听到马桶冲水的声音，那时，明日香转过身，看到美里拖着沉重的步伐从浴室出来，用手背擦着嘴。

"I think I overdid it a bit," mumbled Misato.  
“我觉得我有点过头了，”美里咕哝道。

"A bit? Its disgusting watching a grown women puke like that," said Asuka in disgust.  
“有点？看着一个成年女性那样呕吐真是恶心，”明日香厌恶地说。

Misato stared at her for a few seconds before she asked, "Are you going to eat?"  
美里盯着她看了几秒钟，然后问道：“你打算吃吗？”

"No, not something that that idiot made. Besides half the reason you're probably puking is because of that slop."  
“不，才不吃那个白痴做的东西。再说了，你吐得这么厉害，一半原因可能就是因为那堆烂糊。”

Shaking her head, Misato said, "You should eat something, and he's actually a really good cook. Plus he came over because I asked him, so the least you can do is try it."  
美里摇摇头说：“你还是吃点东西吧，他其实厨艺真的很不错。而且他过来是因为我叫他来的，所以你至少应该试试。”

"Whatever!" snarled Asuka.  
"随你怎么说！"明日香咆哮道。

Misato sighed then, giving into Asuka's attitude.  
美里叹了口气，最终还是屈服于明日香的态度。

"Do what you please then. I'm going to bed earlier. God I think I can feel the headache starting already," said Misato as she slowly made her way to her own room.  
"那你就自便吧。我要早点睡了。天哪，我感觉头痛已经开始发作了，"美里一边说，一边缓缓走向自己的房间。

Asuka continued standing in the kitchen for a moments longer before she walked towards the living room, determined to forget about Shinji's cooking. Flopping down on the couch, she turned the T.V. on and started flipping through channel, though she wasn't really paying attention to what she saw. Rolling over on to her stomach, she buried her face into one of the couch pillows, trying to ignore the rumbling of her stomach, while in the back round some Japanese game show was blaring out of the T.V.  
明日香又在厨房站了一会儿，然后才走向客厅，决心忘记真嗣的烹饪。她扑通一声倒在沙发上，打开电视开始翻频道，尽管她并没有真正注意屏幕上的内容。她翻身趴下，将脸埋进沙发枕头里，试图忽视肚子的咕噜声，而背景中，某个日本游戏节目的喧闹声正从电视里传出。

'...why the hell do I keep thinking of him?' she wondered.  
'...我他妈为什么总是想着他？'她疑惑着。

It was more surprise than anything that had made her react that way, when she saw that Shinji was standing in the kitchen; that and the fact that she had just stepped out of the shower. His stupid face just kept entering her mind every time she let it wander though. But why was she thinking of him? He was annoying, an idiot, insensitive, and an ass-hole.  
让她那样反应的，更多的是惊讶而非其他，当她看到真嗣站在厨房时；再加上她刚洗完澡出来。每当她放任思绪游荡时，他那张愚蠢的脸就会不断闯入她的脑海。但为什么她会想着他呢？他既讨厌，又是个白痴，不体贴，还是个混蛋。

"Damn it," she mumbled as she turned her head to the left, now staring at the white wall across the room. "What the hell is wrong with me?"  
"该死，"她喃喃自语，将头转向左边，现在盯着房间对面那堵白墙。"我到底是怎么了？"

Almost in response to her barely audible question, her stomach gave a tremendous rumble, sending a light blush across her face. Though her embarrassment gave way to anger, as she thought about the food sitting on the counter, just several feet away from where she lay.  
几乎像是回应她那几乎听不见的问题，她的肚子发出了一阵巨大的咕噜声，让她的脸颊泛起淡淡的红晕。尽管她的尴尬被愤怒所取代，因为她想到了放在几英尺外的柜台上的食物。

"Oh...fuck it!" she yelled.  
"哦...去他的！"她大喊道。"

Pushing herself off the couch, she ran her hands through her hair to try to straighten out the loose ends, before she walked into the kitchen. Of course she froze as she saw the full bowl of fried rice just sitting on the counter, as though mocking her.  
她从沙发上起身，双手穿过发丝试图理顺那些松散的发梢，然后走进厨房。当然，当她看到那碗满满的炒饭就那样摆在台面上，仿佛在嘲弄她时，她愣住了。

Narrowing her eyes slightly she first walked over to the kitchen table and grabbed the semi eaten bowl that Misato had barely touched, and placed it in the fridge.  
她微微眯起眼睛，首先走向餐桌，拿起美里几乎没怎么动过的那半碗饭，将其放入冰箱。

'I suppose Misato will finish it later tonight,' she thought.  
“我想美里今晚晚些时候会把它吃完吧，”她心想。

Now walking over to the kitchen counter she paused for a second as she looked down at the bowl of fried rice that Shinji had made for her. Hesitating for no more than an instance, her raging hunger won over her despise of eating something made by that idiot, so she picked it up and placed it in the microwave to warm it up.  
她现在走到厨房台面前，目光落在真嗣为她做的那碗炒饭上，停顿了一秒。尽管对那个白痴做的东西心存厌恶，但饥饿感瞬间占了上风，她还是拿起碗，放进了微波炉加热。

Tapping her index finger against her bare leg, her willful pride slowly started to take over, and she was an instance from ripping the microwave door open, and throwing the entire bowl, food and all, off the front landing of the apartment complex, when the light inside the microwave went out, and the bowl stopped rotating.  
她用食指轻敲着裸露的大腿，任性的自尊心逐渐占据上风，就在她几乎要猛地拉开微波炉门，把整碗饭连同食物一起扔出公寓楼前时，微波炉内的灯光熄灭了，碗也停止了旋转。

Staring at the microwave for a second, she slowly stretched her hand out, and opened the door to it. She was assaulted by such an intense aroma that she almost fell over in surprise.  
她盯着微波炉愣了一会儿，缓缓伸出手，打开了门。一股浓烈香气扑面而来，她几乎被这突如其来的香味惊得站不稳。

'What the hell was that?' she wondered. 'It actually smelled...'  
'这到底是什么鬼？' 她疑惑着。'它居然闻起来...'

Her face suddenly twisted upward as the thought crossed her mind, but she quickly banished it.  
她的脸突然因这个念头而扭曲，但很快她就将其抛诸脑后。

"Yeah right. As if that was possible," she said as she grabbed the bowl out of the microwave, and walked over to the kitchen table.  
“是啊，没错。好像那有可能似的，” 她说着从微波炉里拿出碗，走向厨房的桌子。

Sitting down with the bowl in hand, the aroma still wafting off it, she stared at the bowl for a second with a spoon in hand.  
她坐下来，手里捧着碗，香气依旧缭绕，她拿着勺子盯着碗看了一会儿。

'Am I seriously that hungry that I'll even eat something such as this?'  
“我真的饿到连这种东西都能吃下去吗？”

Unfortunately, the answer came almost immediately as her stomach gave another loud rumble.  
不幸的是，答案几乎立刻就来了，她的肚子又发出了一阵响亮的咕噜声。

'This is simply because I'm starving,' she thought while shaking her head. 'No other implications besides those.'  
“这只是因为我饿极了，”她摇着头想，“除此之外，别无他意。”

But was that true? She honestly didn't know. Maybe she just wanted to try something made by his hands.  
但这是真的吗？她真的不确定。或许她只是想尝尝他亲手做的东西。

'If it tastes horrible, I'll immediately throw it out,' she thought lastly as she took a small bite of the fried rice.  
“如果味道很糟糕，我会立刻把它倒掉，”她最后想着，咬了一小口炒饭。

Almost immediately, as the rice touched her tongue, her taste buds seemed to explode inside her mouth. It was impossible to describe the flavor accurately. It was incredibly simple, but just the way it had been assembled had made all the difference. Asuka knew how to cook well enough by most peoples standards, having to learn how to at a very early stage of her life, but she had never expected to taste something Japanese that she liked. This though...it was amazing simply put. The soy sauce was just enough to soak the rice adequately, while it also made up for the lack of salt that wasn't it in the house. The eggs were cooked perfectly; not too brown, nor to runny. The only thing that could have made this better, was some pork and a few vegetables. But even so-  
几乎就在米饭触碰到她舌尖的那一刻，她的味蕾仿佛在口中爆炸开来。那种味道难以用言语准确描述。它极其简单，但正是这种组合方式，产生了天壤之别。按照大多数人的标准，明日香已经算得上烹饪高手，她从小就不得不学会这项技能，但她从未想过会喜欢上日本料理。然而这份料理……简单来说，令人惊叹。酱油的量恰到好处，充分浸润了米饭，同时也弥补了家中缺少的盐分。鸡蛋煮得恰到好处；既不过焦，也不太稀。唯一能使其更完美的，或许是加点猪肉和几样蔬菜。但即便如此——

"Why is this so good?" asked a startled Asuka as she let the spoon in her hand fall from her grasp and land with a 'clank' on the wooden floor. "Something...so simple...but its perfect." Asuka didn't even think she could have done this well, but oddly enough, it didn't make her anger as it should have.  
“为什么这么好吃？”明日香惊讶地问道，手中的勺子从指间滑落，落在木地板上发出‘哐啷’一声。“如此……简单……却完美无缺。”明日香甚至不认为自己能做到这样，但奇怪的是，这并没有像本该发生的那样激起她的愤怒。

"Damn it...why? Why...that idiot...I-"  
“该死……为什么？为什么……那个白痴……我——”

Again with the strange emotions. She felt suddenly warm inside, and it wasn't just because of the steaming hot bowl in front of her. No...it was something else.  
又是这种奇怪的情绪。她突然感到内心一阵温暖，不仅仅是因为面前这碗热气腾腾的汤。不...是别的东西。

"I hate this feeling! But I can't...I don't understand it...why!"  
“我讨厌这种感觉！但我无法...我不明白...为什么！”

Burying her face in both her hands, she tried to stem the flow of pearly clear tears that starting at the corners of her eyes.  
她双手捂住脸，试图止住从眼角开始涌出的晶莹泪珠。

"I'm crying...over something so stupid...but I can't...stop. And its almost like-"  
"我在为这么愚蠢的事情哭泣...但我停不下来。这感觉几乎就像——"

Asuka froze instantly as that shocking thought crossed her mind. Drawing her hands away from her face, she didn't even seemed to notice that her eyes were still leaking tears. Now looking down at the bowl in front of her, she bent down while still looking at the bowl, and grabbed the spoon she had dropped earlier. Her hair a disheveled mess from earlier when she had been on the couch, and her eyes still crying silently, she threw all these things out the window as she took another bite. But she was positive this time...  
这个惊人的念头闪过脑海时，明日香立刻僵住了。她将双手从脸上移开，似乎没有注意到自己的眼睛仍在流泪。她低头看着面前的碗，弯下腰，捡起了之前掉落的勺子。她的头发因为之前躺在沙发上而凌乱不堪，眼睛依旧无声地流泪，她把这些都抛诸脑后，又吃了一口。但这次她确信...

"This taste...its unique...but, I've had it before."  
"这个味道...独特...但我以前尝过。"

This statement shocked Asuka, and for a moment it seemed that her tears stopped suddenly as though they were even shocked by this. How could she have tasted this before? Its completely impossible. That...idiot, she'd only met him today, so its impossible that she could have tasted it before then. Unless she had had it before at some place in Tokyo-3. But no, she would have remembered something like that, and besides, she hadn't even been out that much.  
这句话让明日香震惊了，一时间她的泪水似乎也突然停止了，仿佛连它们都被这震惊所感染。她怎么可能之前尝过这个？这完全不可能。那个...笨蛋，她今天才第一次见到他，所以之前不可能尝过。除非她在第三新东京市的某个地方尝过。但不对，她会记得这样的事情，而且她也没怎么出去过。

"Then why-" “那为什么——”

But something stopped her.  
但某种东西阻止了她。

What if this was another memory? But then...wouldn't that idiot have something to do with her memories? But she had just met him today! It didn't make any sense!  
如果这只是另一个记忆呢？但那样的话...那个白痴难道与她的记忆有关？可她今天才刚遇到他！这根本说不通！

"Damn it...its all so confusing," said Asuka as she laid her head on the table next to the bowl. "But that idio-Shinji...he's so rude... But this...I hate to admit it, but it is good," she said while looking at the bowl of fried rice.  
“该死...这一切都太混乱了，”明日香把头靠在碗旁边的桌上说道，“但那个笨蛋——真嗣...他太粗鲁了...不过这个...我不得不承认，确实不错，”她看着那碗炒饭说道。

But she couldn't ignore this; it was something that she knew and recognized, but she couldn't remember anything about it. She knew enough about food, to know that it is very difficult to replicate the same taste of something twice over. So she had to assume that she had tried this before, or something incredibly similar to it, and most likely, it had been made by the same person.  
但她无法忽视这一点；这是她知道并认得的东西，却记不起任何关于它的细节。她对食物了解得足够多，知道要两次做出同样的味道是非常困难的。因此她不得不假设自己以前尝试过这个，或者极其相似的东西，而且很可能，它是由同一个人制作的。

"I hate it, but I'm gonna have to ask that idio-" she groaned as she corrected herself, "...Shinji, about this...if only to learn more about my lost memories, since both Misato and Ritsuko don't want to say anything."  
"我讨厌这样，但我不得不向那个白痴——" 她呻吟着纠正自己，"...真嗣，询问这件事...只是为了了解更多关于我失去的记忆，因为美里和律子都不愿意透露任何信息。"

She didn't know why, but at that thought, a small smile passed over her face.  
她不知道为什么，但想到这一点，她的脸上掠过一丝微笑。

"Well...I'll worry about that tomorrow I suppose."  
"嗯...我想明天再担心这个问题吧。"

Sitting upright again, she turned her attention back to the fried rice, and quickly devoured it, for a while forgetting how hungry she had been. Standing up, she placed the bowl in the sink, deciding to let Misato deal with the dishes since it had been her idea to ask Shinji to cook in the first place.  
她再次坐直身子，将注意力转回到炒饭上，迅速将其一扫而空，一时间竟忘了自己有多饿。站起身，她将碗放入水槽，决定让美里处理这些餐具，毕竟最初就是她的主意让真嗣做饭的。

After entering her room, she laid down on her futon, and turned off her bedside lamp looking at the small box resting on the nightstand.  
进入房间后，她躺在自己的被褥上，关掉了床头灯，目光停留在床头柜上那个小盒子上。

'Maybe I shouldn't ask though...' she thought in the end. 'It may be a complete happenstance.'  
"“或许我不该问……”她最终这样想，“这可能只是个巧合。”

But she honestly didn't think that.  
但她真的不这么认为。

Rolling over onto her stomach, she buried her face in her soft pillow and quickly fell into peaceful dreams. Peaceful, because oddly enough, Shinji was in them.  
翻身趴在床上，她把脸埋进柔软的枕头里，很快便沉入了宁静的梦境。宁静，因为奇怪的是，真嗣也在梦中。

---

The sun had set, yet Shinji still hadn't returned to Nerv. Simply put...he was lonely. No matter what he had told Misato, he missed living with her and Asuka. He missed making breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. But he knew that he couldn't live there, not anymore. He was all alone now, Misato had left him, Ritsuko had now sunken so low that Shinji wasn't sure if he'd be able to look at her again, he was unsure how he should act around Rei, and of course Asuka didn't know him anymore. But it was better this way he supposed. If he distanced himself from the people he cared for, then they wouldn't get hurt.  
太阳已经落山，但真嗣仍未回到 NERV。简单来说...他感到孤独。无论他对美里说了什么，他怀念与她和明日香同住的日子。他怀念每天做早饭、午饭和晚饭。但他知道，他不能再住在那里了，再也不能了。现在他孤身一人，美里离开了他，律子已经堕落到了真嗣不确定是否还能再面对她的地步，他不知道该如何与绫波相处，当然，明日香也不再认识他了。但他想，这样也好。如果他远离他在乎的人，那么他们就不会受到伤害。

Looking up at the dark sky, the stars were almost impossible to see because of the many city lights of Tokyo-3. Placing his hands behind his head, Shinji thought, 'If I end of surviving...well, whatever happens in the end, I think I'd like to live in the country somewhere, so I can see the stars and constellations.'  
抬头仰望漆黑的天空，东京-3 的都市灯光几乎让星星无法看见。他将双手枕在脑后，心中暗想，‘如果我能活下来……无论最终会发生什么，我想我会愿意在某个乡村生活，这样我就能看到星星和星座了。’

But of course he would be alone even then.  
但即便如此，他仍将是孤独一人。

Turning his gaze away from the stars, he looked in the direction of Nerv and said, "The last angel...huh?"  
他移开望向星空的目光，转向 Nerv 的方向，喃喃自语：“最后的使徒……吗？”

He knew that he had to confront Kaoru eventually, and very soon, but the idea of killing him still irked him. No matter what Kaoru was, Shinji still thought of him as a human, just as he thought Rei as a human.  
他知道终究得面对薰，而且很快，但想到要杀他，心里还是不舒服。无论薰是什么，真嗣仍把他看作人，就像他看待绫波一样。

"I guess I should get back to Nerv though, before anybody starts getting suspicious."  
“我想我还是得回 NERV，免得有人起疑。”

Shoving his hands in his pockets, Shinji started walking into the heart of Tokyo-3 and eventually passed into the Geofront.  
真嗣把手揣进口袋，开始走向第三新东京市的核心地带，最终进入了地底都市。

---

Kaoru sat up on the shore of the man made lake inside the Geofront.  
薰坐在地底都市人工湖的岸边。

The artificial lights that normally lit the Geofront at night were currently dimmed, attempting to conserve power. Costs had been cut, and the backing that Seele had been giving Nerv had slowly been taken away.  
通常在夜晚照亮地底都市的人工灯光此刻调暗了，试图节约电力。经费被削减，Seele 对 NERV 的支持也逐渐撤回。

Propping himself up with his hands placed behind his back, Kaoru looked across the lake and said, "I guess I should start moving."  
他双手撑在身后，抬头望向湖面，说道：“我想我该开始行动了。”

Standing up, he looked towards the giant pyramid like structure in the middle of the Geofront. Somewhere, deep beneath the bowels of Central Dogma rested the body of Lilith.  
他站起身，望向地底都市中央那座巨大的金字塔状结构。在中央教条深处的某个地方，莉莉丝的躯体静静地躺着。

Now though, he moved his gaze to the East where he could feel a resonating AT-field slowly descending into the Geofront.  
然而此刻，他将目光转向东方，在那里他能感受到一个共鸣的 AT 力场正缓缓降入地底都市。

Smiling slightly, Kaoru said, "I'll be waiting for you...Shinji-kun..."  
微微一笑，薰说道：“我会等着你的……真嗣君……”

### Chapter 25: Creation
创世  

**So this chapter and the next was supposed to be as one, but in the long run I realized that it would been way to big. So this is probably the shortest chapter that you'll see before this story ends  
原本这一章和下一章应该合为一篇，但后来我意识到那样篇幅会过于庞大。所以这可能是你在故事结束前见到的最短的一章了。**

---

In the far East of the Geofront, an elevator door opened and a boy stepped out.  
在 Geofront 的极东之地，一扇电梯门缓缓打开，一个男孩走了出来。

In front of him, another boy stood blocking his way.  
在他面前，另一个男孩站着挡住了他的去路。

Shinji stood still inside the elevator for an undetermined amount of time. He had not expected seeing Kaoru this soon. However, before the elevator doors were able to close, Shinji took several steps out onto the paved path inside the Geofront.  
真嗣在电梯里一动不动地站了不知多久。他没想到这么快就能见到薰。然而，在电梯门还没来得及关闭之前，真嗣就迈出了几步，踏上了地底都市中的铺砌小径。

While the Geofront was man made, to anybody from a western country, it would have seemed natural. The Geofront was designed like an octagon, in that it had eight corners and at each corner, an elevator taking you to the surface could be found. Each of these had a single path from there respected elevators, that eventually converged at Central Dogma.  
虽然地底都市是人造的，但对任何一个来自西方国家的人来说，它看起来都很自然。地底都市设计成八角形，有八个角，每个角都有一个通往地面的电梯。每部电梯都有一条单独的路径，最终汇聚在中央教条区。

In the center of the Geofront was the man made lake, though not everybody knew that the entire thing was really just a sunken in steel bowl. Along the shore line was of course sand, but if you dug down several feet you would hit a steel plate. The steel plate wrapped all around the shore line, though if you were to wade out into the water, before long you would meet a large drop off. At the bottom of the lake was a ventilation system which constantly filtered the water. At many times, the ecologists of Nerv tried to breed fish inside this soulless steel bowl, but they found that the fish could not properly adapt to the environment.  
在 Geofront 的中心，是人造湖，尽管并非所有人都知道整个湖泊实际上只是一个沉入地下的钢制大碗。湖岸线上当然铺满了沙子，但如果你向下挖掘几英尺，就会碰到一块钢板。这块钢板环绕着整个湖岸线，而如果你涉水进入湖中，不久便会遇到一个巨大的落差。湖底设有一个通风系统，不断过滤着湖水。Nerv 的生态学家们多次尝试在这无灵魂的钢制大碗中养殖鱼类，但他们发现鱼类无法适应这个环境。

The Geofront and Central Dogma were of course built upon the Black Moon, Lilith's resting place, so in order to conceal this dark kept secret, Tokyo-3 had to be essentially built on top of it. Every piece of dirt inside the Geofront had been brought from an outside source during the building of Tokyo-3, while the trees, plants, and grass had been grown from another outside source.  
Geofront 和中央教条区当然建在黑月之上，即莉莉丝的安息之地，因此为了隐藏这个黑暗的秘密，东京-3 必须实质上建在其上方。在东京-3 的建设过程中，Geofront 内的每一块泥土都是从外部运来的，而树木、植物和草坪则是在另一个外部来源中培育的。

Essentially, everything inside the Geofront had been grown by nature, but the landscape had been shaped by the humans.  
本质上，Geofront 内的一切都是自然生长的，但景观是由人类塑造的。

The paved path that Shinji was walking down, was currently blocked by Kaoru, but it didn't seem like he wanted to fight. His hands were held up next to his shoulder, giving an impression that he was surrendering, and even though he was smiling, it didn't seem like his usual cynical one. Shinji wasn't going to take any chances though.  
新治正在走的那条铺砌小路，此刻被薰挡住了去路，但看起来他并不想打架。他的双手举在肩旁，给人一种投降的印象，尽管他在微笑，但这似乎不是他平时那种嘲讽的笑。不过，新治并不打算冒险。

Pausing several feet away from him, though still adequately able to attack or defend himself if need be, Shinji opened his mouth and asked, "How come you're out here so late?"  
在新治停下脚步，虽然仍能保持足够的距离以便在必要时攻击或自卫，他张开嘴问道：“你怎么这么晚还在外面？”

Kaoru's hands dropped from the air as he replied, "You should already know that Shinji-kun..."  
薰的手从空中放下，回答道：“你应该已经知道了吧，新治君...”

Shinji narrowed his eyes slightly as he murmured, "You were waiting for me..."  
真嗣微微眯起眼睛，低声说道：“你一直在等我……”

"Of course Shinji-kun," replied Kaoru as he spread his arms wide as though expecting a hug. "Though I just want to talk with you."  
“当然啦，真嗣君，”薰回答道，他张开双臂，仿佛期待着一个拥抱。“不过我只是想和你聊聊。”

"Talk? Isn't it too late for that?" retorted Shinji. "I already...I mean-"  
“聊聊？现在说这个不是太晚了吗？”真嗣反驳道。“我已经……我是说——”

"Yes, you know that I am the final angel," said Kaoru was though he was talking about the weather. "And that we shall eventually have to fight, but I simply want to talk right now."  
"是的，你知道我是最后的使徒，"薰说道，仿佛在谈论天气一般。"我们最终必将一战，但我现在只想谈谈。"

Shinji hesitated slightly. He didn't trust Kaoru, nor did he think he ever could. But he honestly didn't want to fight him, because in a way, he saw himself in him.  
真嗣稍稍犹豫了一下。他不信任薰，也觉得永远无法信任他。但他真的不想与他战斗，因为在某种程度上，他在薰身上看到了自己的影子。

Sighing, Shinji folded his arms and asked, "Why do you want to talk?"  
叹了口气，真嗣交叉双臂问道："你为什么想谈谈？"

"Why not? It seems that you have been avoiding me ever since we first met, so I never got to know you very well."  
"为什么不呢？自从我们第一次见面以来，你似乎一直在回避我，所以我一直没能很好地了解你。"

'I wonder why,' thought Shinji sarcastically.  
'我真想知道为什么，'真嗣讽刺地想。

"And aren't you curious about myself, since you and I are alike," finished Kaoru.  
"既然你我如此相似，难道你就不想了解我吗？" 薰最后说道。

Shinji whipped his head around and starred at Kaoru. He knew that they were similar, and that Kaoru possibly knew something about him. But he wasn't sure if he wanted to know about himself anymore.  
真嗣猛地转过头，盯着薰。他知道他们之间有相似之处，薰可能知道一些关于他的事情。但他不确定自己是否还想了解自己。

"What...do you mean?" said Shinji slowly.  
“你……是什么意思？”真嗣缓缓问道。

Smiling slightly, Kaoru looked over to Central Dogma and said, "You know about Lilith...and now about the first child..."  
薰微微一笑，望向中央教条区，说道：“你知道莉莉丝……还有初号机的事……”

Shinji looked back at him, shocked that he knew about how he had found out about Rei.  
真嗣回头看着他，震惊于他竟然知道自己是如何发现绫波的。

"I've known about Lilith for a while now...as for Ayanami..." Shinji trailed off here, still unsure whether he should confront Rei or not.  
"关于莉莉丝，我已经知道一段时间了...至于绫波..." 真嗣在这里停顿了一下，仍然不确定是否应该面对绫波。

"But you know, since Dr. Akagi showed you earlier."  
"但你知道，自从赤木博士之前给你展示过。"

"How do you know that?" asked a startled Shinji.  
“你怎么知道的？”真嗣惊讶地问道。

Shaking his head, Kaoru said, "It is enough that you know. Then what about me? Yes, I am the final angel, though that it only part of it. You could say, that the first child, Ayanami Rei to you, is the embodiment of Lilith on this planet, as I am the embodiment of Adam, the first angel."  
薰摇了摇头，说道：“你只需知道这一点就够了。那么我呢？没错，我是最后的使徒，但这只是其中一部分。可以说，对你而言的第一个孩子，绫波零，是这个星球上莉莉丝的化身，而我则是亚当，第一个使徒的化身。”

Shinji blinked several times, unable to believe what he had just heard.  
真嗣眨了几次眼，无法相信刚刚听到的话。

"Though that does not mean I am Adam. Each of my brothers and sisters is unique in there own way, as I am also. My angelic name is Tabris, created from Adam as the other angels were, but my soul is that of Adam's. You could say that this is a chance meeting of sorts."  
"尽管这并不意味着我就是亚当。我的每一位兄弟姐妹都有其独特之处，正如我一样。我的天使之名是塔布里斯，与其他天使一样由亚当所创，但我的灵魂属于亚当。你可以称之为某种形式的偶遇。"

"Then...you and Ayanami are alike?"  
"那么...你和绫波零是相似的？"

"Correct, just as you and I are alike."  
"没错，正如你我相似一样。"

"I'm nothing like you," said Shinji suddenly feeling bitter.  
"我和你完全不同，" 真嗣突然感到一阵苦涩。

"Oh? How so? You are able to create a powerful AT-field, you can regenerate damaged tissue, and your eyes turn blood red if your angel self takes over. For all intended purposes, you may as well be labeled an angel yourself."  
"哦？怎么说？你能创造强大的 AT 力场，能再生受损组织，当你的天使自我接管时，眼睛还会变成血红色。从各方面来看，你几乎可以被视为一个天使了。"

"I'm still human!" "我仍然是人类！"

"But far how long?" asked Kaoru with a slight smirk.  
"但究竟要多久？" 薰带着一丝戏谑问道。

Shinji froze momentarily when he heard what Kaoru said, and next moment bit down hard on his bottom lip, drawing blood. He didn't know, and was always in fear of one day waking up and finding out that he had killed half of Nerv's personal.  
听到薰的话，真嗣瞬间僵住了，下一刻他用力咬住下唇，咬出了血。他不知道，也一直害怕有一天醒来，发现自己已经杀死了 NERV 一半的人员。

"I can stay myself," Shinji said stubbornly.  
"我能控制自己，" 真嗣固执地说。

"Maybe you can, maybe not," said Kaoru in a bored voice. "While Seele told me to kill both you and Gendo Ikari, I have found that it is more satisfying to watch and wait, because even after all this time, it is still hard to discern what you are, even with Adam's soul resting in me. Though I begin to understand it better."  
"或许你能，或许不能，" 薰以一种无聊的语气说道。"虽然 Seele 命令我杀死你和碇源堂，但我发现观察和等待更令人满足，因为即使过了这么久，我还是很难分辨你到底是什么，即便亚当的灵魂在我体内。不过我开始更明白了。"

Whiteness suddenly flashed in Shinji's mind then, as though the words Kaoru just said were similar to something he had heard before.  
突然间，白色在真嗣的脑海中闪过，仿佛薰刚刚说的话与他之前听过的某些话相似。

"Ritsuko said that you were sent from Seele...is that true?"  
"律子说你是 Seele 派来的...这是真的吗？"

"Yes, but I have not kept strictly to the plan for Seele's version of Instrumentality. Seele desires to become the gods of the new earth. But there is a separate plan that Seele does not know about, that which us angels adhere to...and the Tree of Life."  
"是的，但我并未严格遵循 Seele 版的人类补完计划。Seele 渴望成为新地球的神。但有一个 Seele 不知道的独立计划，那是我们天使所遵循的……以及生命之树。"

"...I've heard that used before...the Tree of Life. What is it?"  
"……我以前听过这个词……生命之树。它是什么？"

Kaoru was silent for a minute, as though pondering something deep inside him. Seeming to come to a conclusion though, he smiled widely and said, "I suppose that it wouldn't hurt to tell you the story of Adam, Lilith, and the Tree of Life, for it involves yourself closely, all of humanity for that matter, and how you came to become drawn up in all this."  
薰沉默了一会儿，仿佛在深思着什么。随后，他似乎得出了结论，微笑着说：“我想告诉你亚当、莉莉丝和生命之树的故事也无妨，因为它与你、乃至全人类都紧密相关，以及你是如何被卷入这一切的。”

Taking a deep breath, Kaoru started.  
深吸一口气，薰开始了。

"First and foremost, you have to understand human religion. Humans always want to believe that they originated from somewhere, they want to be able to believe in a higher existence then their own that watches over them. So, they created gods, an abstract entity that only exists in the believers mind. But humans were not created out of nothingness, nor did it take billions of years for single celled organisms to eventually develop into humans."  
首先，你必须理解人类的宗教。人类总是希望相信他们来自某个地方，他们想要相信有一个比他们自身更高的存在在守护着他们。因此，他们创造了神，一个只存在于信徒心中的抽象实体。但人类并非凭空而来，也不是单细胞生物经过数十亿年演化最终成为人类。

"I already know that," said Shinji hurriedly. "Adam and Lilith created the first humans."  
“我已经知道这些了，”真嗣急忙说道，“亚当和莉莉丝创造了第一批人类。”

"While true on that simplistic level, that intertwining story that revolves around Adam, Lilith, and all of humanity is much bigger than that."  
"虽然在那个简单的层面上是正确的，但围绕亚当、莉莉丝和全人类交织的故事远比那更为宏大。"

"Adam and Lilith did not create the universe, nor do they know how it was created. Either it has always existed in infinite time, or it was created by an even higher being than themselves. Maybe it was created by one of your gods...maybe the Christian God. Adam and Lilith don't know, so I don't know. Us angels are able to share each others thoughts and knowledge if we so desire. But Adam and Lilith existed in this wide expanse of space, and after an untold amount of time, it came into their minds that they desired a place to settle down and live."  
"亚当和莉莉丝并没有创造宇宙，他们也不知道宇宙是如何诞生的。或许它一直存在于无限的时间中，或者是由比他们更高级的存在所创造。也许是你们信仰的神之一...或许是基督教的上帝。亚当和莉莉丝并不知晓，所以我也不清楚。我们天使能够共享彼此的思想和知识，如果我们愿意的话。但亚当和莉莉丝存在于这广阔无垠的太空中，经过无数岁月，他们心中萌生了想要安定下来生活的愿望。"

Sighing slightly, Kaoru stuck his hands in his pockets and said, "The White Moon and Black Moon, that which corresponds to Adam and Lilith. In the beginning, they were something of a separate plane, sectioned off from the rest of space. Adam and Lilith used them as a means of rest, hibernation I suppose. What you have to understand, is that how you humans view us angels, is not how we truly are. When we descend to earth, we give ourselves form, a body I suppose, for we our nothing more than energy beings, formless masses of energy that would seem like white static to humans. Adam and Lilith were no different, and existed without a body throughout there travels in the universe. The Moons though were a means of travel from one solar system to another, for even Adam and Lilith would become weary of moving through space without any means. However, they kept in contact with each through their thoughts, and even feelings for each other."  
轻叹一声，薰将双手插进口袋，说道：“白月与黑月，对应着亚当与莉莉丝。起初，它们是独立于其他空间的一个层面，被隔离开来。亚当和莉莉丝将它们作为休息之地，我想可以说是休眠。你必须明白，你们人类看待我们天使的方式，并非我们真正的模样。当我们降临地球时，我们赋予自己形体，或许可以说是躯体，因为我们不过是能量体，无形无状，对人类而言就像白色静电。亚当和莉莉丝也不例外，他们在宇宙中的旅行中没有实体。然而，月亮是他们从一个太阳系穿梭到另一个太阳系的工具，因为即便是亚当和莉莉丝，在无任何辅助的情况下穿越太空也会感到疲惫。不过，他们通过思想保持联系，甚至彼此间的情感交流。”

Here Kaoru paused though and a strange expression, almost one of confusion seemed to pass over his face.  
说到这里，薰停顿了一下，脸上掠过一丝奇怪的表情，近乎困惑。

"I don't know the entire details behind there travels, because I am the last of the angels brought about by the White Moon, but they eventually came to a small planet, which of course you humans know as earth."  
"我不知道他们旅行的全部细节，因为我是由白月带来的最后一位天使，但他们最终到达了一个小星球，当然，你们人类称之为地球。"

Shinji was surprised at the tone of Kaoru's voice. It was much deeper and more methodical than his usual carefree voice.  
真嗣对薰的声音感到惊讶。它比他平时无忧无虑的声音要深沉和有条理得多。

"The Moons collided against earth, and while the Black Moon of Lilith crashed in what would later become Japan, the White Moon has never been found. Some personal from Nerv claim that the White Moon was found during the contact experiment with Adam in Antarctica, but it is unsubstantiated, and my knowledge does not support this hypothesis. It is likely that Adam moved it far away after the Lilim were created, fearing that they would learn its secrets.  
"月亮撞击了地球，而莉莉丝的黑月坠落在后来成为日本的地方，白月却从未被找到。Nerv 的一些人员声称，在南极与亚当接触实验期间发现了白月，但这未经证实，我的知识也不支持这一假设。很可能是亚当在莉莉姆被创造后将其移至远方，担心他们会发现其秘密。"

Earth was young then, and is still young according to Adam and Lilith, but they were patient, and slowly, it seemed that the same force that gave birth to the universe created life on earth. Trees grew, plants grew, and Adam and Lilith grew along with them, for they had never seen such things on any other planet they had ever visited. And as there knowledge of living planets grew, so did their love for each other. Adam and Lilith loved each other, as a husband and wife do, but it was different than that, because they had been with each since as far back as they could remember. But they each had a different love that was unique to them. Adam gave the love not of Lilith to the stars and the sky, the feel of water and smell of the air. But Lilith gave her love not of Adam to all the plants she encountered, and delighted in naming them."  
那时地球还很年轻，按照亚当和莉莉丝的说法，它现在依然年轻，但他们耐心等待，慢慢地，似乎是孕育宇宙的那股力量也在地球上创造了生命。树木生长，植物生长，亚当和莉莉丝也与它们一同成长，因为他们从未在其他任何星球上见过这样的景象。随着他们对生命行星的了解增长，他们对彼此的爱也日益加深。亚当和莉莉丝相爱，如同夫妻一般，但这又有所不同，因为他们自记忆所及之始就一直相伴。然而，他们各自还有一种独特于对方的爱。亚当将对莉莉丝的爱赋予了星星和天空，水的触感与空气的气息。而莉莉丝则将对亚当的爱倾注于她所遇到的每一种植物，并乐于为它们命名。

Sadness seemed to pass over Kaoru's face briefly, as thought he was remembering a particularly painful memory.  
悲伤似乎短暂地掠过了薰的脸庞，仿佛他在回忆一段特别痛苦的记忆。

"As time passed though, they became estranged from each other, and no longer sought each other out and wandered the valleys in which the things of which they loved existed. But as it chanced, Adam wandered more than Lilith did, because he was able to view the stars from every place he pleased, desiring to see the stars in different locations. And he met Lilith among the trees and plants in a long forgotten location, and he was dumbfounded, for he had forgotten about her, which he had once loved, and desiring a body that would seem fair to himself, he created something akin to the bodily shape of a human, and caught her in the woods."  
然而，随着时间的流逝，他们彼此疏远，不再相互寻找，也不再漫步于那些他们所爱之物存在的山谷。但巧合的是，亚当比莉莉丝更常游荡，因为他可以从任何他喜欢的地方观赏星星，渴望在不同的地方看到星星。他在一个久被遗忘的地方，在树木和植物之间遇到了莉莉丝，他惊呆了，因为他已经忘记了曾经爱过的她，渴望一个看起来对自己公平的身体，他创造了一个类似于人类体型的东西，并在树林中抓住了她。

Shaking his head slowly, Kaoru said, "The long story of Adam and Lilith continues on for a while after this meeting, during which there is not much to say, besides the fact that Lilith desired a body similar to Adam and created one. The image of woman was born out of this. It is one of the reasons myself, and Ayanami Rei are as we are. We alone out of the angels appear in a human body, because we house the souls of Adam and Lilith respectively. However, the soul of Lilith..." Kaoru seemed to trail off, and didn't finished his sentence.  
薰缓缓摇头，说道：“亚当和莉莉丝的故事在这次相遇后还会持续一段时间，期间并没有太多可说的，除了莉莉丝渴望拥有一个与亚当相似的身体并创造了一个。女性的形象由此诞生。这也是为什么我和绫波零会如此的原因之一。我们天使中只有我们两个以人类的身体出现，因为我们分别承载着亚当和莉莉丝的灵魂。然而，莉莉丝的灵魂……”薰似乎话音未落，没有继续说下去。

"Now though, we enter a new phase in the interaction between Adam and Lilith, that being the Tree of Life, and the coming of the Lilim.  
如今，我们进入亚当与莉莉丝互动的新阶段，即生命之树，以及莉莉姆的到来。

After a time, Adam pondered the possibility of creating another being similar to himself, though with less power. He came to Lilith with this, and they collaborated with each other, both desiring children of sorts. That is how us beings known as angels were born, for though Adam and Lilith are counted among the angels, they are merely the forerunners. They are entirely different beings that are on a different level than us angels. But Lilith was not happy with this, having little to do with the creation of the angels. She kept her silence though, and feigned happiness.  
一段时间后，亚当思索着创造一个与他相似但力量较弱的存在的想法。他向莉莉丝提出了这个想法，他们共同合作，都渴望拥有某种孩子。这就是我们被称为天使的存在的诞生，尽管亚当和莉莉丝也被算作天使，但他们只是先驱者。他们是与我们天使完全不同的存在，处于不同的层次。但莉莉丝对这一创造并不满意，与天使的诞生关系不大。尽管如此，她保持沉默，假装快乐。

After five millenniums though, she grew tired of the angelic beings akin to Adam more so than she was, and wandered far on the planet earth, no longer desiring to be with Adam. She went as a young woman, still loving the shape that she had molded for herself. But Adam had gone back to being a formless shape of energy, because the angels could not assume a human form as Adam and Lilith could. So his love grew for them, while all the while, Lilith slowly disappeared from his mind. But after a time she returned, and told him what she desired, and Adam took pity on her. Though she hated the pity he gave her, her desire for children of her own outgrew the scorn she now showed towards him, and eventually they worked together."  
然而，五千年后，她对那些比她更像亚当的天使感到厌倦，于是远离地球，不再渴望与亚当相伴。她以年轻女子的形态游走，依然钟爱自己塑造的身形。但亚当已回归无形能量的形态，因为天使无法像亚当和莉莉丝那样化为人形。因此，他对天使的爱意渐增，而莉莉丝则逐渐从他心中淡去。但一段时间后，她回来了，向亚当诉说了她的愿望，亚当对她心生怜悯。尽管她憎恨他的怜悯，但渴望拥有自己孩子的愿望超越了她对亚当的轻蔑，最终他们携手合作。

Sighing heavily, Kaoru said in a heavy tone, "Never was a graver mistake made in all the confines of the universe than the creation of the Lilim, for while Adam had created the angels, he had given them a certain level of power. But the Lilim where unique, because even though they lacked power, they were still able to seize it, and change there destiny's according to what they desired.  
"叹息一声，薰沉重地说道：“在整个宇宙的范围内，从未有过比创造莉莉姆更严重的错误，因为尽管亚当创造了天使，并赋予了他们一定的力量。但莉莉姆是独特的，尽管他们缺乏力量，却仍能夺取并改变自己的命运，按照他们的愿望行事。”

And so, Adam tore off a piece of his own body and molded it into a shape of his choice, and so man was formed. But Lilith tore upon her chest cavity, and from the fluid that leaked out, she created the soul of the man, and give him a self...the AT-field. Lilith wanted more though, and begged Adam to make a being in likeness to herself, and Adam tore off another piece of himself and formed it into woman. Lilith then gave woman a soul, and an AT-field to define her. Thus, the Lilim were created.  
于是，亚当撕下自己身体的一块，塑造成他选择的形状，人类便由此诞生。但莉莉丝撕开了自己的胸腔，从流出的液体中创造了人的灵魂，并赋予他自我意识——即 AT 力场。莉莉丝还想要更多，她恳求亚当创造一个与她相似的生物，亚当便再次撕下自己身体的一部分，塑造成女人。莉莉丝随后赋予女人灵魂和定义她的 AT 力场。就这样，莉莉姆诞生了。

Now Adam saw the change in Lilith's demeanor, and was displeased by it, sensing the greed and hatred she now had for him, and in response, he created the Tree of Life."  
亚当察觉到莉莉丝态度的变化，对此感到不悦，他感受到了她对他的贪婪与憎恨。作为回应，他创造了生命之树。

"And what is the Tree of Life exactly?" asked Shinji, trying to wrap his head around this convoluted story.  
“生命之树究竟是什么？”真嗣问道，试图理解这个错综复杂的故事。

"The Tree of Life...is essentially that which governs everything. The changing of the seasons, the rotation of the earth, the continued growth of all living things, but more so, it is the life force of earth. Adam created the Tree of Life so that earth would continue growing without needed assistance from himself, for after the many millenniums that passed, he grew tired of earth. But he still loved it nonetheless. But the Tree of Life had a secondary purpose, for in Lilith's thoughts which they still shared, he saw an unbidden desire blossom in her, and was afraid by it.  
生命之树……本质上掌管着一切。季节的更迭，地球的自转，所有生物的不断成长，但更重要的是，它是地球的生命力。亚当创造了生命之树，以便地球能在不需要他帮助的情况下继续生长，因为在经历了无数个千年之后，他厌倦了地球。但他仍然深爱着它。然而，生命之树还有一个次要目的，因为在他们仍共享的思想中，他看到了莉莉丝心中萌生的一种不由自主的欲望，这让他感到害怕。

Now the Lilim grew and slowly populated the earth, having the power to create there own offspring, but in one thing did Adam expressly forbid Lilith to do, and that was to expose her knowledge to them. Lilith however, disobeyed him, loathing the way he was able to mingle with his own children, the angels, while she was forbade to. And so Lilith taught the Lilim much of her knowledge. They learned the names of the planets, living plants and the stars, and soon grew to be able to wield primitive tools. But in no worse thing did she do than envelop them within the Black Moon of Lilith."  
如今，莉莉姆族逐渐繁衍并遍布地球，拥有创造自己后代的能力，但亚当明确禁止莉莉丝做一件事，那就是向他们透露她的知识。然而，莉莉丝违抗了他，憎恨他能够与自己的孩子们——天使们——混在一起，而她却被禁止这样做。于是，莉莉丝向莉莉姆传授了许多她的知识。他们学会了行星、活植物和星星的名字，并很快能够使用原始工具。但她所做的最糟糕的事情，是将他们包裹在莉莉丝的黑月之中。

Here, Kaoru paused for a minute and said something else, "You of course know the story in the Christian Bible how Eve was enticed by the serpent to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and thus discovered right from wrong. This is the truth behind that story.  
"在这里，薰停顿了一下，又说道：“你当然知道基督教《圣经》中的故事，夏娃如何被蛇引诱，吃了知善恶树上的果子，从而明白了是非对错。这就是那个故事背后的真相。”

The humans that followed Lilith into the Black Moon learned much about far away planets, mystical arts, and the like, but they also gained something unique that the angels did not possess, and that was the understanding of good and evil. The angels do not understand good and evil. Something either is, or it isn't. That is the way we define things. But Adam and Lilith understood the concept of good and evil, and Lilith immediately knew that what she had done was evil, but Adam also recognized this, reading Lilith's thoughts even though they were on separate sides of the planet.  
"跟随莉莉丝进入黑月的人类学到了许多关于遥远星球、神秘艺术等知识，但他们还获得了一种天使所不具备的独特理解，那就是善恶的认知。天使们并不理解善恶。事物要么存在，要么不存在。这是我们定义事物的方式。但亚当和莉莉丝理解善恶的概念，莉莉丝立刻意识到她所做的是恶，而亚当也认识到了这一点，尽管他们相隔半个星球，却能读懂莉莉丝的思想。”

Adam confronted Lilith about her decision to let humans learn the secrets of the Black Moon and at the same time removed the White Moon from the planet, fearing that humans would seek for it. Adam then told Lilith about the Tree of Life, prophesying that after many years of continued growth from the Lilim, they would eventually bring about the destruction of the Tree of Life, meaning the planet earth. Lilith rebuked him however, saying that she did not care about his own agendas, and only wished to be with her own children. Adam said that Lilith was a fool, and that every living thing was wrapped up within the Tree of Life."  
亚当质问莉莉丝关于她让人类学习黑月秘密的决定，同时将白月从星球上移除，担心人类会寻找它。亚当随后向莉莉丝讲述了生命之树，预言经过多年莉莉姆的持续成长，他们最终会导致生命之树的毁灭，即地球的毁灭。然而，莉莉丝反驳他，说她不在乎他的个人议程，只希望与自己的孩子在一起。亚当说莉莉丝是个傻瓜，并说每一种生物都包裹在生命之树中。

Sighing heavily, Kaoru said, "The Tree of Life, the sustenance of earth, and that which us angels adhere to, for Adam gave us a purpose after the designs of Lilith were full wrought, and told us that after a time, we were to protect the Tree of Life, even if it meant the destruction of the Lilim.  
叹了口气，薰说：“生命之树，地球的滋养，我们天使所依附的，因为亚当在莉莉丝的设计完成后给了我们一个目的，并告诉我们，在某个时刻，我们要保护生命之树，即使这意味着莉莉姆的毁灭。”

Each branch of the Tree of Life governs something on earth, except for the Lilim which the Tree of Life is unable to interfere with, but the Lilim can interfere with it. As each branch of the Tree of Life governs something, so does each angel govern a branch of the Tree of Life. Each angel is set higher than the next on the branches, and each increasing branch upon which the angel rests on, he can read the thought of the angels below him, but not above him, if there is such a thing. Myself as being the last angel, I knew before hand what would transpire and while the death of my brothers and sisters saddens me, I still accept it. But I do not know what happens after this, only Adam and possibly Lilith know.  
生命之树的每一分支都掌管着地球上的一物，除了利利姆，生命之树无法干涉它们，但利利姆却能干涉生命之树。正如生命之树的每一分支掌管着某物，每位天使也掌管着生命之树的一个分支。天使们在分支上的位置逐级升高，每上升一个分支，天使便能读取下方天使的思想，却无法读取上方天使的思想，如果有的话。作为最后一位天使，我事先知晓将要发生的一切，尽管兄弟姐妹的逝去令我悲伤，我依然接受。但我不知晓此后会发生什么，只有亚当和可能的莉莉丝知晓。

As you have now guessed, the time has come which Adam had prophesied long ago, that the Tree of Life would die out as humans consumed the life force of the earth, and that the angels would be sent to destroy them for the greed that they inherited from Lilith."  
正如你现在所猜测的，亚当很久以前预言的时刻已经到来，生命之树将随着人类消耗地球的生命力而消亡，天使们将被派遣去毁灭他们，因为他们继承了莉莉丝的贪婪。

"But that was several thousand years ago!" complained Shinji.  
“但那是几千年前的事了！”真嗣抱怨道。

"Yes," replied Kaoru, "and humans have not learned of their mistakes from the past. At first, us angels took pity on you, not desiring to destroy you, since we all originated from one being. But as time wore on, we learned of the cruelty that you showed to other living things and beings like yourselves. And we grew to hate you, being so wrapped up in the Tree of Life."  
"是的，" 薰回答道，"而人类并未从过去的错误中吸取教训。起初，我们天使对你们心生怜悯，不愿毁灭你们，因为我们皆源自同一存在。但随着时间的推移，我们见识了你们对其他生灵及同类所展现的残忍。我们开始憎恨你们，深陷于生命之树的束缚中。"

"So you hate me yourself!" yelled Shinji.  
"所以你恨我！" 真嗣大喊道。"

"I did not say that, nor will I ever say that," replied Kaoru. "You are different, because you are like myself. And you are unique as a human even with the angel half of you."  
"我并未如此说，也永远不会这样说，" 薰回答道，"你与众不同，因为你与我相似。即便拥有天使的一半，你在人类中也是独一无二的。"

"So what! I don't want to be unique!"  
"那又怎样！我不想与众不同！"

"But you are, and you have to realize your importance in all this. But I am not done yet with my story."  
"但你就是，你必须意识到自己在这一切中的重要性。不过，我的故事还没讲完呢。"

"Now Lilith pondered everything that Adam had said and grew displeased by it, seeing the eventual destruction of her children. But her desire she still saw as a possibility."  
"现在，莉莉丝思索着亚当所说的一切，对孩子们最终的毁灭感到不满。但她仍将欲望视为一种可能。"

"And what was that!" spat out Shinji.  
"那是什么东西！" 真嗣吐了一口唾沫说道。

Smiling slightly, Kaoru said, "I don't know, because it was never revealed to us by Adam. Only he knew what she wished for. But I have a guess, and that was that she wished to recreate the earth in a way she saw fit for humans."  
微微一笑，薰说道："我不知道，因为亚当从未向我们透露过。只有他知道她许了什么愿。但我有个猜测，那就是她希望以她认为适合人类的方式重建地球。"

"How though? The earth existed before Adam and Lilith I thought?"  
"但怎么可能呢？地球不是在亚当和莉莉丝之前就存在了吗？"

"It did, and while I said recreate, I meant it in a way which removes the angels, Adam, and now also the Tree of Life from the equation. She would set herself as the heart of earth, creating and destroying things as she pleases."  
"确实如此，虽然我说的是重新创造，但我的意思是将天使、亚当以及现在的生命之树都排除在外。她将自己设定为地球的核心，随心所欲地创造和毁灭事物。"

Shinji frowned slightly, not thinking that this was a particularly bad idea.  
真嗣微微皱眉，并不认为这是一个特别糟糕的主意。

"As it stand though, it seems that her plan is coming to fruition, since I am now the last angel."  
"尽管如此，看起来她的计划正在实现，因为现在我是最后一个天使了。"

"You guys attacked us first though," mumbled Shinji almost inaudibly.  
"但明明是你们先攻击我们的，" 真嗣几乎听不清地咕哝道。

"Yes, but it was to insure that we had a future, to insure that we would continue surviving, and if the Tree of Life dies, than so do you and all other humans. The Tree has long since been bereft of fruit and is now decaying rapidly. It will only be a matter of time before the planet starts dying."  
"是的，但这是为了确保我们有一个未来，为了确保我们能继续生存下去，如果生命之树死去，那么你们和其他所有人类也会随之消亡。生命之树早已不再结果，现在正迅速腐烂。不久之后，星球也将开始死亡。"

"But killing us just because we made a mistake-"  
"但仅仅因为我们犯了一个错误就杀掉我们——"

"Which you continue to make," said Kaoru harshly.  
"你还在继续制造这些，" 薰严厉地说道。

Shinji bit down on his lips, unsure how he should take all this. If Kaoru was telling the truth about everything he said...then how exactly was Shinji supposed to react to all this.  
真嗣咬紧了嘴唇，不确定该如何应对这一切。如果薰所说的都是真的...那么真嗣究竟应该如何反应这一切呢。

"You haven't told me how I fit into all this," said Shinji suddenly.  
"你还没告诉我我在这其中扮演什么角色，" 真嗣突然说道。

Kaoru, who had been looking down at his own feet looked up and smiled while saying, "Well as for that, you hold a special place in both ours, and Lilith's plans."  
一直低头看着自己脚的薰抬起头，微笑着说：“关于那一点，你在我们的计划和莉莉丝的计划中都占有特殊的位置。”

"Why is that?" “为什么？”

"You are both simultaneously angel and human, meaning you can either rebuild the Tree of Life as an angel, or cast it down as a human. You could even chose your own path completely irrelevant to the others, but you can decide that when the time comes. And besides, it seems we will have guests soon."  
“你们既是天使又是人类，这意味着你们可以作为天使重建生命之树，也可以作为人类将其推翻。你们甚至可以选择一条完全与其他人无关的道路，但可以在时机到来时再做决定。而且，看来我们很快就会有客人了。”

As he said this, Kaoru seemed to disappear and reappear directly in front of Shinji. Stretching his index finger out, he pressed it against Shinji's forehead. The moment Kaoru's finger pressed against his forehead, a bright light seemed to enter Shinji's mind. All at once, a surge of memories hit him. A blue sky, white sand, a formless shape talking to him, everything from his previous encounter with the angel known as Tabris rushed back to him.  
说着这些话，薰似乎消失了，又直接出现在真嗣面前。他伸出食指，按在真嗣的额头上。薰的手指触碰到他额头的那一刻，一道明亮的光似乎进入了真嗣的脑海。突然间，一股记忆涌入他的意识。蓝天，白沙，一个无形的存在在与他交谈，之前与被称为塔布里斯的使徒相遇的一切记忆都涌回他的心头。

"You...you," said Shinji meekly. "Before...the test with Unit 01...and I met you."  
"你...你，" 真嗣怯生生地说道。"之前...零一机测试的时候...还有我遇见你的时候。"

"Correct," said Kaoru as he took several steps back. "That was me back then, the true me I suppose."  
"没错，" 薰一边说一边后退了几步。"那时的我，我想是真正的我吧。"

"That was...you told me that was earth."  
"那时...你告诉我那就是地球。"

"I did. It is the same earth as this, but it is altogether different, because of the choices you made. It was one of the many alternative choices you could make. One that is similar to letting the Tree of Life die, but also different at the same time."  
"我确实看到了。那里的地球与这里相同，却又截然不同，因为你们做出了不同的选择。那是你们众多可能选择中的一个。类似于让生命之树枯萎，但又有所不同。"

"But then...was that reality?"  
"那么...那真的是现实吗？"

"Yes and no. It is the reality of the Shinji Ikari that chose that possibility, but you no longer have that possibility."  
"既是也不是。那是选择了那种可能性的碇真嗣的现实，但你已经不再拥有那种可能了。"

"But how...did I get...there in the first place, and why were you there?"  
"但我是怎么...一开始就到那里的，还有你为什么会在那里？"

Kaoru paused for a minute in confusion, as though he didn't really know.  
薰困惑地停顿了一下，仿佛他并不真正知道。

"I'm not sure why I was there, but I believe it was to find your wandering mind. As for you being there...it was likely the influence of Lilith."  
"我不确定我为什么在那里，但我认为是为了找到你游离的心神。至于你出现在那里...很可能是莉莉丝的影响。"

"...Influence of...Lilith. What do you-"  
"...莉莉丝的影响。你这是什么意思-"

Something whizzed through the tree around them and-  
有什么东西嗖地一声穿过他们周围的树丛，然后-

-Next moment, something orange flashed in front of him.  
-下一刻，一抹橙色在他眼前闪过。

"What the-" "什么鬼-"

"Looks like they finally set up," murmured Kaoru as he tilted his head towards the North.  
"看来他们终于布置好了，" 薰一边低语，一边将头偏向北方。"

Shinji turned his head along with Kaoru, and next second caught what he had missed the first time.  
真嗣随着薰转头，下一秒就发现了第一次没注意到的东西。

From far away, Shinji was just barely able to see the glimmer of something like a scope before it exploded. The muzzle of the gun erupted as the armor piercing bullet came ripping through the air, aimed at Kaoru. Kaoru without hesitating, deployed his AT-field, and the velocity of the bullet was cut to zero as it came into contact with Kaoru's AT-field. The bullet immediately stopped, and fell to the ground without incident.  
从远处，真嗣勉强能看到一个类似瞄准镜的微光在爆炸前一闪而过。枪口喷发，穿甲弹撕裂空气，直指薰。薰毫不犹豫地展开了他的 AT 力场，子弹在接触到薰的 AT 力场时速度骤降至零。子弹立刻停止，毫无波澜地坠落地面。

"I guess this is Gendo Ikari's message to the men of Seele," sighed Kaoru as he looked in the direction of the sniper. It was then that Shinji noticed Kaoru's feet seemed to have left the ground, and that he was hovering several inches above the paved path.  
“我想这是碇源堂给 Seele 那些人的信息，”薰叹息着望向狙击手的方向。就在这时，真嗣注意到薰的双脚似乎离开了地面，他正悬浮在铺砌的小径上方几英寸处。

"Kaoru...what are you-" Shinji asked.  
“薰...你在做什么——”真嗣问道。

Kaoru had raised his right arm high above his head, and turned his entire body towards the position where the sniper was concealed. Without hesitating, he swung his arm down.  
薰将他的右臂高高举过头顶，全身转向狙击手藏匿的位置。毫不犹豫地，他挥臂而下。

Shinji had known that his AT-field was powerful, but he never would have guessed something like this.  
真嗣知道自己的 AT 力场很强大，但他从未料想到会有这样的事情。

His AT-field streaked like a thing piece of wire almost touching the ground through the air, flying towards its target. The edge of blades of grass where severed off, while trees were decapitated at there base. It looked as though the place had just been deforested in a matter of seconds. And yet...  
他的 AT 力场如同一条细线般几乎贴着地面疾驰而去，直奔目标。草叶的边缘被切断，树木则在根部被斩首。仿佛这片区域在几秒钟内就被迅速砍伐一空。然而...

Shinji could hear the brief yell before it was brutally cut off as Kaoru's AT-field spliced the snipers body apart, cutting into the bridge of his noes, and continuing down until he looked like a hot dog. He had been laying down while sniping.  
真嗣能听到那短暂的喊叫声，随即被残忍地截断，因为薰的 AT 力场将狙击手的身体撕裂，切入他的鼻梁，并继续向下，直到他看起来像一根热狗。他当时正趴着进行狙击。

"...Kaoru...you," said Shinji, taking a few seconds to get his voice back.  
“……薰……你，”真嗣说道，花了好几秒才找回自己的声音。

"Hmmm? I did nothing but defend myself. You would have done the same thing Shinji-kun."  
“嗯？我不过是自卫罢了。真嗣君，你也会这么做的。”

"No I wouldn't! Taking a persons life without a seconds thought. Its-"  
"不，我不会！未经片刻思考就夺取一个人的生命。这——"

"But he was prepared to take mine, and while he had been acting on orders, it was still ultimately his decision to fire."  
"但他准备夺走我的生命，尽管他是奉命行事，但最终开枪还是他的决定。"

"Kaoru!" yelled Shinji. ""薰！"" 真嗣喊道。

Kaoru smiled lightly as he started rising further in the air, his gaze now shifting towards Central Dogma.  
薰轻轻一笑，随着他继续向空中升起，目光转向了中央教条区。

"I'll await you in Lilith's chamber. There is one last thing that I haven't told you, but as for that, I am not sure myself."  
“我会在莉莉丝的房间等你。还有一件事我没告诉你，但至于那件事，我自己也不确定。”

Kaoru then turned, and glided through the air as he made his way towards Central Dogma.  
随后，薰转身，在空中滑翔着朝中央教条区飞去。

Shinji meanwhile stood stock still with his eyes wide open as everything Kaoru had said coursed through his mind. Simply put, he didn't know what to do. Kaoru...was not a bad person, that was what Shinji thought, and so he didn't want to fight him. But if all of humanity was to be destroyed...then...  
与此同时，真嗣站在原地一动不动，双眼圆睁，脑海中回响着薰所说的一切。简单来说，他不知道该怎么办。薰……并不是个坏人，这是真嗣的想法，所以他不想与他战斗。但如果全人类都要被毁灭……那么……

Shinji shook his head, unfortunately knowing what he'd most likely have to do at the end of it all. Starring in the direction of the giant pyramid shaped building inside the Geofront, Shinji mumbled, "Adam and Lilith...and I fit somewhere in between."  
真嗣摇了摇头，无奈地知道最终他可能不得不做出什么决定。他凝视着地底都市中那座巨大的金字塔形建筑，低声自语：“亚当和莉莉丝……而我介于两者之间。”

Making a decision, he started sprinting towards Central Dogma.  
下定决心后，他开始向中央教条区疾奔而去。

"What did you say!" yelled Misato as she sat bolt upright in her makeshift bed.  
“你说什么！”美里猛地从临时床上坐直身子，大声喊道。

She had no idea how late it was, only that she had gone to bed heavily drunk, and at Ritsuko's words, she felt wide awake now.  
她并不知道现在几点，只知道自己是醉醺醺地入睡的，但在听到律子的话后，她现在感到异常清醒。

"'Nagisa Kaoru has been classified as the last angel, and has been ordered to be killed on sight' is what the commander Ikari said a little while ago. Just thought I should let you know," said Ritsuko over the phone.  
“碇司令刚才说，‘渚薰已被归类为最后使徒，一经发现立即处决’。我只是觉得应该告诉你一声。”律子在电话那头说道。

"So it is true," mumbled Misato. "Anyway, I'll be down there in a few minutes."  
"原来是真的，" 美里喃喃自语。"总之，我几分钟内就下去。"

"Hang on Misato, thats not all. It was sometime ago, but Kaoru was seen talking to Shinji over at the eastern most gate. We sent a sniper to take Kaoru out, but we haven't heard from him so its assumed that he..." Ritsuko trailed off here, though Misato understood the meaning behind the brief silence.  
"等等，美里，不止这些。是之前的事了，但有人看到薰在东门那边和真嗣说话。我们派了一个狙击手去解决薰，但我们一直没收到他的消息，所以……" 律子说到这里停了下来，尽管美里明白这短暂的沉默背后的含义。"

"What did Kaoru talk to Shinji about?" asked Misato as she started looking for clothes that were acceptable.  
"薰和真嗣说了些什么？" 美里边问边开始寻找合适的衣服。"

"I've no idea, but it seems that Kaoru is heading to Central Dogma now."  
"我不知道，但看起来薰现在正前往中央教条区。"

"I'll be there in ten minutes," said Misato as she hung up the phone.  
"我十分钟内到，" 美里说完挂断了电话。"

Walking to her door, she slid it open, only to come face to face with Asuka.  
她走向自己的房门，滑开门，却迎面碰上了明日香。

Misato opened her mouth in surprise, but Asuka cut her off quickly by saying, "Whats wrong? Has another angel appeared?"  
美里惊讶地张开了嘴，但明日香迅速打断她，问道：“怎么了？又有使徒出现了吗？”

Misato closed her mouth, and accidentally bit down on her tongue. She hadn't thought about having a confrontation with Asuka right now.  
美里闭上了嘴，不小心咬到了舌头。她没想到现在就要和明日香对峙。

"Oh...um, no. I just...forgot to do something, and Ritsuko just reminded me about it," said Misato, not believable in the least.  
“哦...嗯，没有。我只是...忘了做某件事，然后律子刚刚提醒了我，”美里说，一点都不可信。

"Hmmm...really?" asked Asuka with a raised eyebrow, not believing her for a minute.  
"嗯...真的吗？" 明日香挑起眉毛问道，完全不相信她的话。

"Ah, yeah, so I should really get-"  
"啊，是的，所以我真的该走了-"

"Does that idiot have anything to do with why your going in?" asked Asuka in one breath.  
"那个白痴跟你去有什么关系吗？" 明日香一口气问道。

The sudden jerk of Misato's head was really all the answer that Asuka needed, however, Misato tried to feign her ignorance as she said, "Huh? Idiot? What are you talking about?"  
美里突然的点头动作，对明日香来说已经是足够的回答了，然而，美里还是试图装傻，说道：“啊？傻瓜？你在说什么呢？”

Asuka crossed her arms in front of her chest and said with a slight sneer, "Who else but...that idiot that was here earlier." Apparently, she had gone back to refusing to use Shinji's name.  
明日香交叉双臂在胸前，带着一丝嘲讽地说：“除了……刚才在这里的那个傻瓜，还能有谁。”显然，她又回到了拒绝称呼真嗣名字的状态。

"Oh...him," muttered Misato as her shoulders seemed to sag. She couldn't possibly brush of Asuka's question now with a simple lie.  
“哦……他啊，”美里喃喃自语，肩膀似乎垂了下来。她现在不可能再用一个简单的谎言来搪塞明日香的问题了。

Asuka then started tapping her index finger against her right arm, waiting for Misato to say something truthful, all the while becoming more annoyed as the seconds ticked by.  
明日香随后开始用食指轻敲右臂，等待美里说出一些真话，随着时间的流逝，她变得越来越不耐烦。

"He...most likely has something to do with this," said Misato only halfway telling the truth. "As you already guessed...an angel has appeared, the final one actually. Its Kaoru...the fourth child, he's an angel. A sniper was sent to kill him...but we haven't heard back from him...so most likely he's dead. But the last transmission we received from him, was saying that the third, and fourth children were talking to each other. It seems the fourth, now classified as the final angel, is descending on Central Dogma. Its likely that...Shinji will pursue him."  
"他……很可能与此事有关，"美里只说了一半的实话。"正如你已经猜到的那样……一个天使出现了，实际上是最后一个。他是薰……第四适格者，他是一个天使。派了一名狙击手去杀他……但我们没有收到他的回音……所以很可能他已经死了。但我们收到的最后一条信息，是说他看到第三和第四适格者在交谈。看来第四适格者，现在被归类为最后的使徒，正在向中央教条区降落。很可能……真嗣会去追他。"

"In which case I can help out."  
"那样的话，我可以帮忙。"

"Wha...Asuka?" "什...Asuka？"

"I'll launch in Unit 02...we don't have the first anymore..."  
"我将驾驶二号机出击...我们没有初号机了..."

Misato bit her tongue to hold her silence, but she had heard a strange rumor that Rei had somehow survived the explosion of Unit 00, if that was at all possible. However-  
Misato 咬紧牙关保持沉默，但她听到了一个奇怪的传闻，说 Rei 不知怎么地在零号机的爆炸中幸存了下来，如果那真的可能的话。然而——

"I can't let you pilot yet Asuka."  
"我还不能让你驾驶，明日香。"

"That again!" said Asuka suddenly firing up. "How many times do I have to tell you Misato. I. Am. Fine!"  
"又是这个！" 明日香突然激动起来，"我得跟你说多少遍，美里。我。没。事！"

"That remains to be seen," said Misato, "we still haven't been able to have any tests done on your synchronization with Unit 02."  
"这还有待观察，" 美里说，"我们还没能对你的同步率与二号机进行任何测试。"

"Then this can serve as a test, and actual combat," replied Asuka stubbornly.  
“那这可以当作一次测试，实战测试，”明日香固执地回答。

"Absolutely not!" yelled Misato as she planted her foot firmly down on the hardwood floor.  
“绝对不行！”美里大喊着，坚定地将脚踩在硬木地板上。

Asuka seemed rather taken aback at Misato's sudden assertiveness, but stood her ground nonetheless.  
明日香对美里突如其来的强硬态度显得有些惊讶，但仍然坚持自己的立场。

"I'm piloting!" "我在驾驶！"

"No you are no-" "不，你不是——"

However, a loud ringing could be heard from behind Misato. Turning back into her room, she grabbed the phone off the ground next to her futon and listened intently to the person on the other line. Asuka meanwhile, had propped her back against the door frame of Misato's room, and was frowning intently as Misato continued talking away into the phone.  
然而，一阵响亮的铃声从美里身后传来。她转身回到房间，从榻榻米旁的地板上抓起电话，专注地听着对方的话。与此同时，明日香则背靠在美里房间的门框上，皱着眉头，看着美里继续对着电话滔滔不绝。

After a few minutes, Misato slowly put the cordless phone back on the receiver and looked down at it for a few seconds. She seemed worried.  
几分钟后，美里缓缓将无绳电话放回听筒，低头凝视了几秒。她显得忧心忡忡。

"Whats up?" asked Asuka from the doorway suddenly.  
“怎么了？”明日香突然从门口问道。

Misato turned towards her and said, "Ritsuko just called back. They found the sniper...but the description..." Misato shook her head, as she recalled what Ritsuko had told her on how he had likely died.  
美里转向她，说道：“律子刚刚回电了。他们找到了狙击手……但描述……”美里摇了摇头，回想起律子告诉她的关于他可能的死法。

"Is that it?" asked Asuka.  
"就这些吗？" 明日香问道。

"No, Kaor...the angel it seems has entered Central Dogma."  
"不，薰...看来天使已经进入了中央教条。"

Asuka continued starring at Misato for a few seconds before the question that had been nagging at the back of her mind ever since Misato picked up the phone sprung forward.  
明日香继续盯着美里看了几秒钟，然后那个自从美里接起电话就一直萦绕在她脑海中的问题突然冒了出来。

"Did anyone...I mean...about that idiot..."  
“有人……我是说……关于那个笨蛋……”

Misato was rather surprised at the tone in Asuka's voice.  
美里对明日香声音中的语气感到相当惊讶。

'Did I just hear that right? Did she sound worried?' she wondered.  
“我刚刚听对了吗？她听起来是不是在担心？”她暗自思忖。

"No, nobody has seen Shinji since last at the East gate."  
“不，自从上次在东门之后，就没人见过真嗣了。”

"I see," mumbled Asuka dejectedly.  
“这样啊，”明日香沮丧地喃喃道。

Misato blinked openly at Asuka for a few seconds before she sighed and said, "Hurry and change. I'll take you to Nerv along with me, since something seems to be bothering you."  
美里愣愣地盯着明日香看了几秒钟，然后叹了口气说：“快去换衣服。我带你一起去 NERV，既然你似乎有什么心事。”

"Huh? What gave you that idea?"  
"嗯？你怎么会有这种想法？"

"No...never mind then," mumbled Misato as she turned away from Asuka. "Just change into something quickly."  
"不...算了，" 美里嘟囔着，转身离开明日香。"快去换件衣服吧。"

"Okay," said Asuka as she turned away from Misato, her fiery hair swinging behind her.  
"好的，" 明日香说着，转身离开美里，她那火红的头发在身后摇曳。

As Misato watched her leave, she briefly thought, 'I hope I don't regret this...'  
看着她离开，美里短暂地想道，‘希望我不会后悔这个决定...’

---

The entirety of Central Dogma filled Shinji's vision as he looked up at it. He knew that Kaoru had entered it earlier, had felt his AT-field ripping apart one of the many entrances leading in. Shinji didn't know why though, but he didn't want anybody to see him. He had already hidden from several Nerv operatives as he made his way along the paved path from the East gate to Central Dogma. But he supposed that the second he entered Central Dogma, his position would be pegged.  
当真嗣抬头望向中央教条区时，整个区域尽收眼底。他知道薰之前已经进去了，感觉到他的 AT 力场撕裂了通往其中的众多入口之一。真嗣虽然不知道原因，但他不想被任何人看见。他在从东门到中央教条区的石板路上已经避开了几名 NERV 的操作员。但他猜想，一旦他进入中央教条区，他的位置就会被锁定。

Checking around carefully, he ran towards the concealed exit that was used for emergency access only. Normally, it was something only the workers that maintained the Geofront used, but Shinji thought they could make an exception to him. However, as he pushed against the bar that would open the door, he swore lightly.  
仔细环顾四周后，他跑向那个仅供紧急使用的隐蔽出口。通常情况下，这是只有维护地底都市的工作人员才会使用的地方，但真嗣认为他们可以为他破例一次。然而，当他推压那根会打开门的横杆时，他轻声咒骂了一句。

"Damn it...locked." 该死...锁上了。

Shinji bit down on his lip and thought about his options. He could go to one of the main entrances of course and get spotted immediately. Or he could...  
真嗣咬了咬嘴唇，思考着他的选择。他当然可以去其中一个主入口，但那样立刻就会被发现。或者他可以...

Looking down at his right hand that hung at his side, he clenched it suddenly and thought, "They'll find out eventually anyway."  
低头看着垂在身旁的右手，他突然握紧了拳头，心想，"反正他们迟早会发现的。"

Thrusting his right hand forward while still clenched in a fist, he produced a cone like AT-field that smashed against the emergency door, forcing it inward, until the hinges holding it in place could no longer support the odd direction that door was being forced into. With a loud snap, and the sound of two large pieces of metal coming in contact with each other, Shinji pushed the door inward, until it looked like nothing but a crumpled piece of paper.  
他紧握右拳向前一推，生成一个锥形 AT 力场，猛烈撞击紧急门，迫使其向内凹陷，直到固定门的铰链再也无法承受这股怪异的推力。随着一声巨响和两块大金属的碰撞声，真嗣将门推入，直到它看起来就像一张皱巴巴的纸。

Ignoring what he had done, he ran past the crumbled door, and flew down the corridor until he reached a flight of stairs used for emergency purposes. Jumping them two at a time, he passed five flights of stairs before he reached a landing where a door with a push bar stood. Not dropping his pace for even an instance, he ran against the door, forcing it open. Though admittedly, he didn't think it would have swung open so suddenly.  
他无视自己的所作所为，跑过那扇被压扁的门，沿着走廊疾驰，直到抵达一处用于紧急疏散的楼梯。他两步并作一步跳上楼梯，连续跨越五段楼梯后，来到一个设有推杆门的平台。他丝毫未减缓速度，径直冲向门，强行将其撞开。虽然他确实没想到门会突然这么轻易地打开。

Shinji seemed to fly out from this door and into a long corridor lined with many doors and rooms that had safety glass along the walls. It seemed he had crashed directly into the science department.  
真嗣仿佛从这扇门中飞出，进入了一条长长的走廊，两侧排列着许多带有安全玻璃的门和房间。看来他直接闯入了科学部门。

'At least I know where I am,' thought Shinji suddenly as he picked himself off from the floor. But behind him he heard an audible scream.  
“至少我知道我在哪儿，”真嗣突然想到，他挣扎着从地板上爬起来。但就在他身后，他听到了一声清晰的尖叫。

Spinning around, he saw a woman in a white lab coat running in the opposite direction, and papers spilling from her arms.  
他迅速转身，看到一个身穿白色实验服的女人正朝相反方向跑去，手中的文件散落一地。

Frowning quizzically, Shinji walked over to one of the rooms with the safety glass along one of its walls, and examined his reflection.  
真嗣皱着眉头，好奇地走向一间带有安全玻璃墙的房间，仔细打量着自己的倒影。

"Ah, she must have thought I was Kaoru," mumbled Shinji as he looked back at his own reflection. His eyes must have changed blood red when he used his AT-field. But even so, he would have figured most people at Nerv, especially in the science department, knew now about his...condition.  
"“啊，她肯定以为我是薰了，”真嗣喃喃自语，回头看着自己的倒影。使用 AT 力场时，他的眼睛必定变成了血红色。但即便如此，他本以为 NERV 的大多数人，尤其是科学部门的人，现在应该都知道他的……状况了。”

Shaking his head, he thought, 'From here, the Evangelion chambers or still several floors down, so I should probably try to find an eleva-'  
"他摇了摇头，心想，‘从这里开始，还要下好几层才能到 EVA 格纳库，所以我应该去找个电梯——’”

Something rocked the very depths of Nerv suddenly, and Shinji for a moment felt he was going to lose his balance. But without a doubt, it had to be-  
突然间，NERV 的最深处受到了冲击，真嗣一时感觉自己快要失去平衡。但毫无疑问，这一定是——

"Kaoru," muttered Shinji softly. He had felt his AT-field then, and it was more powerful than anything he had felt before. He wasn't sure if he could beat him...  
“薰，”真嗣轻声念道。他刚刚感受到了他的 AT 力场，那力量比他之前所感受到的任何一次都要强大。他不确定自己是否能战胜他……

Scrunching up his face, he ignored the worrying feeling in his chest and sprinted down the hallway, where he remembered there should be an elevator. As he continued sprinting though, he said without caring whether someone heard him or not, "I hope to God Misato doesn't come here."  
他皱起眉头，无视胸中的不安感，沿着走廊疾跑，记得那里应该有一部电梯。尽管他继续奔跑，却毫不在意是否有人听到，自言自语道：“希望 Misato 不要来这里。”

Unfortunately, that only made him even more worried, as the prospect of somebody else coming also entered his mind.  
不幸的是，这反而让他更加担忧，因为想到可能还有其他人来。

Kaoru had forced his way into the Evangelions chamber, and was currently standing in front of Unit 02 on the walkway. Smiling up at it, he said, "Shall we pave a path of destruction, Unit 02?"  
Kaoru 强行闯入了 EVA 的机库，此刻正站在 Unit 02 前的通道上。他微笑着抬头望向它，说道：“我们一起去开辟一条毁灭之路，Unit 02？”

Rising up in the air he hovered just in front of Unit 02's eyes and seemed to beckon to it. Unit 02's eyes suddenly opened as it shuddered against the bracers holding it in place. The walkway that Kaoru had been standing on split in half, as Unit 02 floating seamlessly upward, just as Kaoru had done earlier.  
他升至空中，悬浮在 Unit 02 的眼前，仿佛在向它招手。Unit 02 的眼睛突然睁开，机身在固定它的支架上颤抖。Kaoru 所站的通道随即裂成两半，Unit 02 如同之前的 Kaoru 一样，无缝地向上浮起。

Smiling slightly, Kaoru looked down at the wide bottom of the Evangelions chamber where he could force his way into Terminal Dogma. Swinging his right arm down in an arc, the metal flooring was split in two, opening up a wide chasm so that Unit 02 could fit through.  
Kaoru 微微一笑，低头看向 EVA 机库宽阔的底部，那里是他进入终端教条的必经之路。他挥下右臂划出一道弧线，金属地板应声裂开，形成一个宽阔的深渊，足以让 Unit 02 通过。

Slowly descending now, with Unit 02 directly behind him, Kaoru started lowering himself into Terminal Dogma. However, out from the depths where the light of the sun could not pierce, a voice that was harsh one second, and yet pleasant the next seemed to vibrate around him.  
缓缓下降着，身后紧跟着 02 号机，薰开始进入终端教条区。然而，从阳光无法穿透的深渊中，一个时而刺耳、时而悦耳的声音似乎在他周围回荡。

Laughing lightly as the soul of Adam engulfed him and filled him with the knowledge of this voice, he said, "I suppose Lilith is expecting me."  
当亚当的灵魂吞没他，赋予他这声音的知识时，他轻笑道：“我想莉莉丝在等我。”

---

Ayanami Rei stood alone in the chamber of Lilith.  
绫波零独自站在莉莉丝的房间里。

No...not alone. 不...并非独自一人。

For the soul of Lilith was present also.  
因为莉莉丝的灵魂也在场。

### Chapter 26: Adam's Spawn  
第 26 章：亚当的子嗣  

**Longest chapter to date...and boy is it a doozy. God that sounded lame. But really it is...  
迄今为止最长的一章……而且绝对精彩。天哪，听起来真俗气。但确实如此……**

---

Asuka gripped the handle on the passenger side door as Misato came swinging around the corner at fifty-five miles an hour while the sign seconds before had clearly said thirty. Now though, this being the fourth time they had hit a corner this fast, Asuka's heart rate didn't skyrocket like it had done the first time. Even so though, this speed was a little much.  
明日香紧握着副驾驶座车门上的把手，看着美里以每小时五十五英里的速度急转弯，而几秒钟前路标明明显示限速三十。不过，这已经是他们第四次以这种速度过弯了，明日香的心跳不再像第一次那样飙升。即便如此，这样的速度还是有点过头。

"Uhhh...Misato," said Asuka after making sure that no more turns were coming for a while. "I know that your driving sucks, but isn't this...a little too fast..."  
"呃...美里，" 明日香在确认一段时间内不会再有转弯后说道，"我知道你开车技术不怎么样，但这也...太快了吧..."

Misato continued staring out of the windshield while gripping the steering wheel tightly. Asuka frowned slightly at the expression on Misato's face. Simply put, she couldn't ever remember seeing her this worried.  
美里继续紧盯着挡风玻璃，双手紧紧握住方向盘。明日香微微皱眉，看着美里的表情。简单来说，她从未见过她如此忧心忡忡。

Finally opening her mouth, Misato said, "Sorry. I know that I'm driving faster than normal, but..."  
美里终于开口说道："对不起。我知道我开得比平时快，但是..."

"But what?" asked Asuka. "但是什么？" 明日香问道。

"I'm worried about Shinji," Misato said simply. "And I'm worried about...what happens after this."  
"我担心真嗣，" 美里简单地说道。"还有我担心...这一切结束后会发生什么。"

"Why?" “为什么？”

"This is the final angel...but what happens to us after all the angels are defeated."  
"这是最后的使徒...但所有使徒都被击败后，我们又会怎样。"

"Go back to our normal lives I suppose," said Asuka with a shrug.  
"我想是回到我们正常的生活吧，" 明日香耸了耸肩说。

Misato held her tongue. Did Asuka honestly expect a normal life after all this? Even with the angels defeated, experiments would still be conducted, tests with the Evangelions would still continue. Most likely, Asuka would go back to Germany and continue living there, while Unit 02 would go with her. Shinji though... Misato wasn't sure what would happen to him. Then there was Seele, and she couldn't help but feel that they had a large part to play in the end of all this, since they were the ones that sent them the final angel apparently.  
美里忍住了话。明日香真的以为这一切之后还能有正常的生活吗？即使天使被击败了，实验仍将继续，对 EVA 的测试也会继续进行。很可能，明日香会回到德国继续在那里生活，而二号机也会随她一同回去。至于真嗣... 美里不确定他会怎么样。还有 Seele，她不禁觉得他们在这一切的结局中扮演了重要角色，毕竟据说是他们送来了最后的使徒。

"How come you're worried about that idiot?"  
"你怎么会担心那个笨蛋？"

"Who? Shinji?" "谁？真嗣？"

Asuka bit her lip, but nodded anyway, resigning to the fact that Misato had addressed him by his name.  
明日香咬了咬嘴唇，但还是点了点头，接受了美里已经叫出他名字的事实。

Misato paused for a second before saying, "I can't help but feel, that whatever happens after the final angel is defeat, Shinji is going to change. But I don't...think it will be a good change."  
美里停顿了一下，然后说道："我忍不住觉得，无论在最终使徒被击败后会发生什么，真嗣都会有所改变。但我不...认为这会是一个好的变化。"

"...You always sound like you know him well."  
"...你总是听起来好像很了解他。"

Misato glanced out of the corner of her eye to see Asuka watching her keenly while slumped against the side of the passenger door.  
美里用眼角余光瞥了一眼，看到明日香正靠在副驾驶门边，目光锐利地盯着她。

"I suppose that I do know him well," mumbled Misato.  
""我想我确实很了解他，""美里咕哝道。

'In fact, I probably know him best...besides yourself,' Misato said in her mind as an afterthought.  
'事实上，我可能比你自己更了解他，'美里在心中暗自补充道。

No matter what Shinji said or denied that it was impossible to replicate what him and Asuka once had, Misato held onto the hope that they would one day be able to rekindle the feelings they had for each other.  
无论真嗣如何否认或声称他们曾经拥有的感情无法重现，美里始终抱着一线希望，期待他们有一天能重新点燃彼此间的情感。

"You're gonna pass the turn if you don't slow down," said Asuka after a few minutes pause as she rested her head against the cool glass of the passenger side window.  
“如果你不减速，就要错过转弯了，”几分钟后，明日香将头靠在乘客侧的冰凉车窗上，打破了沉默说道。

Misato's response, was to swing the car in a half circle, making Asuka briefly wish that she hadn't come along as she gripped the door handle so hard that it was in danger of snapping off.  
美里回应的方式是猛地将车打了个半圈，这让明日香短暂地希望自己没跟着来，她紧握车门把手，力度之大仿佛随时都会将其捏断。

It seemed that he had been expected, since Unit 01's entry plug was ready to be inserted into the Eva. Shinji could only assume that he had been seen on cameras earlier as he had ran through the hallways of the science department searching for an elevator. He was grateful though that everything had been prepared for him.  
看来他早已被预料到会出现，因为初号机的插入栓已准备好插入。真嗣只能推测，他在科学部门走廊里奔跑寻找电梯时已被摄像头捕捉到。不过，他很感激一切都已经为他准备妥当。

Noticing the plug suit that hung on the railing in front of Unit 01, he quickly dawned it without any worry of someone watching him, and looked up into the face of Unit 01. He didn't know when it had happened, but he supposed that Unit 01 was something of his partner in combat. Though he himself had a certain power like that of an angels, he felt that he could always rely on Unit 01 if he got into a pinch. Part of that was probably the knowledge that every time he stepped into the entry plug, he knew that his mother was right next to him.  
注意到挂在初号机前栏杆上的插入栓服，他迅速穿上，毫不担心有人窥视，抬头望向初号机的面孔。他不知道何时开始，但他觉得初号机在战斗中就像是他的伙伴。尽管他自己拥有类似天使的力量，但他觉得在紧要关头总能依靠初号机。部分原因可能是他每次进入插入栓时，都知道母亲就在他身边。

Climbing up the long the ladder, he lowered himself into the entry plug and instantly synchronized with Unit 01. Quite frankly, he hadn't felt this calm in a while. His worry about Asuka, Rei, what Kaoru had told him, and everything about his own mysterious powers were thrown out the window as he inhaled the LCL fluid.  
他沿着长梯攀爬，缓缓进入插入栓，随即与初号机瞬间同步。坦白说，他已经很久没有感到如此平静了。对明日香、绫波的担忧，薰告诉他的事情，以及自己那些神秘力量的种种，都在他吸入 LCL 液体的那一刻被抛诸脑后。

Opening up a communication channel for the command center, he was surprised to see vice commander Fuyutsuki on the line.  
他打开与指挥中心的通讯频道，惊讶地看到副指挥官冬月出现在屏幕上。

"Fuyutsuki? ...What are you-"  
“冬月？……你这是——”

"Major Misato is on her way," he replied curtly. "Until then, I will be in charge of this operation. The angel has started its descent into Terminal Dogma along with Unit 02. It is passing the eleventh gate right now-"  
"真嗣少校正在赶来，"他简短地回答。"在此之前，我将负责这次行动。使徒已经与二号机一起下降到最终教条区。它现在正通过第十一号大门——"

"Unit 02?" stammered Shinji in surprise at Fuyutsuki's statement. But he bit his lip in worry over Misato coming. In truth, he really didn't want her here when he-  
"二号机？" 听到冬月的话，真嗣惊讶地结巴起来。但他咬着嘴唇，担心着美里会来。实际上，他真的不希望她在这里，当他——

"Unit 02 has been classified as an enemy with the control that the angel has over it. Thus you have been ordered to destroy it"  
"二号机已被归类为敌人，由于使徒对其的控制。因此，你被命令摧毁它。"

"But...another Evangelion...and its Asuka's," mumbled Shinji.  
"但...又是一台 EVA...而且是明日香的," 真嗣咕哝道。

Fuyutsuki was silent for a minute until he said, "Be that as it may, the commander has said to treat Unit 02 as an enemy. And we can't know whether or not the angel has joined with Unit 02, contaminating it completely."  
冬月沉默了一会儿，然后说："尽管如此，司令已经下令将二号机视为敌人。我们无法确定天使是否已经与二号机结合，完全污染了它。"

"Then have Ritsuko do a full diagnostic on its sys-"  
"那就让律子对它的系统进行全面诊断-"

"Dr. Akagi has..." Fuyutsuki hesitated here for a second, as though determining whether Shinji should know about this or not.  
"赤木博士她……" 冬月在这里犹豫了一下，似乎在考虑是否应该让真嗣知道这件事。

Only one thing passed through Shinji's mind though at what Fuyutsuki has said.  
然而，真嗣脑海中只闪过一个念头，关于冬月所说的话。

'Did they found out about Ritsuko showing me the truth of Ayanami and the dummy plug system?'  
‘他们是不是发现了律子让我知道绫波和傀儡系统的真相？’

"Well...it doesn't really matter," finished Fuyutsuki with a frown.  
“嗯...其实无所谓了，”冬月皱着眉头说道。

'No, it really didn't matter,' thought Shinji. As long as he did what he was supposed to do, nothing else mattered.  
“不，真的无所谓，”真嗣心想。只要他做好自己该做的事，其他什么都不重要。

As Shinji turned to sever the link between the two, Fuyutsuki halted him.  
当真嗣转身准备切断两者之间的联系时，冬月阻止了他。

"Hang on Shinji..." "等等，真嗣……"

"What? I should be-" "什么？我应该……"

"I know...just, don't push yourself. We all care about you...Gendo included."  
"我知道……只是，别太勉强自己。我们都关心你……包括源堂。"

"He doesn't give a da-"  
"他根本不在乎——"

"No he does...or at least...a part of him does."  
"不，他在乎……或者说，至少……他的一部分在乎。"

"Whats that supposed to mean?"  
"那是什么意思？"

Shaking his head, Fuyutsuki said, "Never mind, I shouldn't have said anything." After a few moments of staring at each other over the screen, Fuyutsuki sighed and said, "I don't think I ever told you, but your mother used to be a student of mine."  
摇了摇头，冬月说：“算了，我不该提的。”两人隔着屏幕对视片刻后，冬月叹了口气，说道：“我想我从未告诉过你，但你母亲曾是我的学生。”

Shinji blinked several times at this sudden surprise and opened his mouth wide before saying, "My mom...what? Student?"  
真嗣对这个突如其来的消息眨了几次眼，张大嘴巴后才说：“我妈妈……什么？学生？”

"I used to be a teacher at the university she attended; I taught Gendo also. Your mother was an extraordinarily bright and gifted student, so it pained me when I learned that she had died in the contact experiment with Unit 01. But as her son, I see that you inherited her kindness."  
“我曾在她就读的大学任教；我也教过源渡。你母亲是个极其聪明且有天赋的学生，所以当我得知她在与初号机的接触实验中去世时，我感到非常痛心。但作为她的儿子，我看到你继承了她的善良。”

Shinji turned his head away from Fuyutsuki feeling oddly embarrassed by this compliment.  
真嗣把头从冬月那里转开，对这个赞扬感到莫名尴尬。

"Have Misato contact me when she arrives," said Shinji as he manually removed the safety locks binding Unit 01 in place.  
“美里到了就让她联系我，”真嗣一边说，一边手动解除束缚初号机的安全锁。

"Will do, and Shinji..." “明白，还有真嗣……”

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Trust in your own judgement."  
“相信你自己的判断。”

Shinji's face was passive for a few minutes before he smiled slightly and said, "Thanks," before the connection was gone.  
真嗣的脸色平静了几分钟，然后微微一笑，说道：“谢谢。”随后连接就断开了。

However, his smile fell moments after Fuyutsuki's face disappeared. A heavy sigh escaped his half closed lips then as he readied himself for what he was about to do.  
然而，在冬月副司令的脸消失后不久，他的笑容也随之消失。他半闭着嘴唇，沉重地叹了口气，然后准备迎接即将到来的事情。

Making Unit 01 walk forward, he proceeded to the only elevator that would take him into Terminal Dogma.  
让零号机向前走去，他继续前往唯一能通往最终教条区的电梯。

---

Tires screeched against asphalt as Misato's car skidded into a parking spot in one of the many parking garages of Nerv that littered the entirety of Tokyo-3. Before the car had even come to a complete stop, Misato yanked the key out of the ignition and threw her car door open.  
米莎托的车在东京-3 众多 NERV 停车场中的一个里急刹车，轮胎与柏油路面摩擦发出刺耳的声音。车子还没完全停稳，米莎托就猛地拔出钥匙，推开车门。

Asuka, who's nails had been in threat of being torn off at this last harebrained turn, let go of the passenger sides door handle and seemed to twitch slightly. A bead of sweat dripped down the side of her face as she let out a sigh of relief.  
明日香，她的指甲差点在这最后疯狂的转弯中被扯掉，松开了乘客侧的车门把手，似乎微微抽搐了一下。一滴汗珠从她的脸颊滑落，她松了一口气，叹息了一声。

'Dear God...I thought I was going to die,' she thought as she opened the passenger side door and stepped out of the car.  
'天哪...我以为我要死了，' 她想着，一边打开副驾驶座的门，从车里走了出来。

Standing to her full height, she looked around at Misato who had already started walking over to an elevator that would start there trip to Nerv. Asuka had never been to Nerv this way before, as it wasn't something Evangelion pilots usually took. It for more...well, less important people in her opinion. So she was rather surprised that Misato would take such a way.  
她站直了身子，环顾四周，看到美里已经朝着一部电梯走去，那将是她们前往 NERV 的起点。明日香从未以这种方式去过 NERV，因为这通常不是使徒驾驶员会选择的路线。在她看来，这是为那些更...嗯，不那么重要的人准备的。所以她对美里会选择这种方式感到相当惊讶。

Trotting over to Misato, who had already swiped her Nerv security card through the slot next to the elevator and was now waiting impatiently for the door to open, Asuka asked her the question she had just bee pondering.  
明日香小跑着来到美里身边，美里已经将她的 NERV 安全卡刷过电梯旁的插槽，正不耐烦地等待着电梯门的打开。明日香问出了她刚刚一直在思考的问题。

"Hey Misato...how come we're taking this way to Nerv? Couldn't we have just taken one of the gates like we normally do?"  
“嘿，美里...我们为什么要走这条路去 NERV？不能像平时那样走其中一个大门吗？”

Misato seemed not to hear her though, as she was biting her nails absentmindedly and tapping her foot in impatience.  
但美里似乎没听见，她心不在焉地咬着指甲，不耐烦地用脚敲打着地面。

Asuka felt a trace of irritation at this, and if it had been any one else, she probably would have kicked them in the back of the leg. Certainly if it had been that idio-  
明日香对此感到一丝恼火，如果是别人，她可能早就踢了对方的腿后跟。当然，如果是那个白痴——

'No, don't think about that,' thought Asuka as she shook her head frantically. But at this gesture, Misato seemed to realize Asuka was standing behind and turned asking-  
“不，别想那件事了，”明日香疯狂地摇头想着。但这个动作似乎让美里意识到明日香站在身后，转身问道——

"Huh? Sorry, did you say something Asuka?"  
“嗯？抱歉，你刚才说什么了吗，明日香？”

"Why are we taking the lowly employee route to Nerv?"  
“我们为什么要走这条低级员工通道去 NERV？”

"Oh...good question actually," said Misato as she scratched her head in a confused gesture.  
"哦...这问题问得好，" 美里挠着头，一脸困惑地说道。

"You serious? You don't know why you went this way?"  
"你是认真的吗？你不知道为什么要走这条路？"

"No...well, I was thinking about other things while driv-Oh...the elevators here."  
"不...嗯，我开车时在想别的事情——哦...这里的电梯。"

Ending the conversation, Misato hurriedly stepped into the elevator while Asuka, with a frown on her face, did likewise. Punching in the very bottom number on the keypad next to the elevator door, the elevator took them under the streets of Tokyo-3. Even though Asuka had never seen this part of Nerv, she still understood that there was a tram of some-sorts that ran underneath Tokyo-3 that was strictly for Nerv's use.  
结束对话后，美里匆忙踏入电梯，而明日香则皱着眉头紧随其后。她按下电梯门旁键盘上的最底层数字，电梯便载着她们深入东京-3 的地下。尽管明日香从未见过 NERV 的这一部分，但她仍明白这里有一条专供 NERV 使用的地铁线路，穿梭于东京-3 的地下。

As the elevator doors opened, it seemed that what Asuka had heard was true.  
当电梯门打开时，似乎明日香所听闻的情况得到了证实。

It looked more like a subway than anything really. Two trams sat on a metal rail, and Asuka guessed that one went towards Nerv for when people were going to work, and the other was for when people went home. Though she figured that these weren't the only two.  
这里看起来更像是一个地铁站而非其他。两条金属轨道上停着两辆电车，明日香猜测一辆是供上班时前往 NERV 的，另一辆则是下班时使用的。尽管她认为这并非仅有的两条线路。

The open area they were in wasn't all that large, compared to what most of Japan's subway systems looked like. A low hung ceiling rested above there heads, while between the elevator they had just stepped out of, and the tram several steps away from them, there really wasn't much room in between. But then again, this wasn't the only parking garage that was used for Nerv, so rush hour shouldn't be too much of a problem. At least nobody else seemed to be heading towards Nerv like they were, though Asuka was sure this had something to do with it being the end of the work day.  
他们所在的这片开阔区域并不算大，与日本大多数地铁系统相比显得狭小。低垂的天花板悬在他们头顶，从刚走出的电梯到几步之外的电车之间，空间实在有限。不过话说回来，这并非 NERV 使用的唯一停车场，所以高峰时段应该不会太拥挤。至少目前看来，似乎没有其他人像他们一样赶往 NERV，尽管明日香确信这与下班时间有关。

The tram that they were hurrying towards was overly white with bright red trim along the very top of it. It was relatively small, looking as though somebody had cut a bus in half and called it good. Three windows were placed inches apart along the left and right sides of the tram, while a large window in the front and back could also be looked out of. The one thing that Asuka missed was the driver, but thinking about it, everything was automated now days.  
他们匆忙赶往的那辆电车通体雪白，顶部饰以鲜红的条纹。它相对较小，看上去像是有人把一辆公交车一分为二，便就此作罢。电车左右两侧每隔几英寸就设有窗户，前后也各有一扇大窗可供向外望。明日香唯一怀念的是司机，但转念一想，如今一切都已自动化了。

"Oi Asuka! Hurry it up," came Misato's voice, who was standing in the doorway of the tram and waiting for her.  
“喂，明日香！快点儿，”美里站在电车门口喊道，正等着她。

"Wha? Oh sorry." "啊？哦，对不起。"

Hurrying along, her bright red hair swinging behind her, she entered the tram just as the doors closed. She supposed that after somebody entered it, it gave a few seconds to see if anybody else entered before the doors closed.  
她急匆匆地走着，亮红色的头发在身后摆动，就在车门关闭的那一刻，她进入了电车。她猜想，当有人进入后，电车会给予几秒钟的时间看看是否还有其他人进入，然后车门才会关闭。

Sitting down on one of the seats, she leaned her head back and asked, "Are we under the Geofront."  
她坐在一个座位上，将头靠在椅背上，问道：“我们现在是在地底都市吗？”

"Right now no. We're still a few levels above it, but it does start to slope down and go under the Geofront directly to Central Dogma."  
"现在还不行。我们还在它上面几层，但它确实开始向下倾斜，直接穿过地表前端通往中央教条。"

"Hmmm...I see," mumbled Asuka, though she was honestly thinking that if she had to do this every single day, she'd die of boredom.  
"嗯……我明白了，"明日香喃喃自语，尽管她心里其实想着如果每天都得做这件事，她会无聊死的。"

Several minutes later, Asuka could definitely feel the downward angle that the tram was going at, and then the tunnel they were in disappeared along side them.  
几分钟后，明日香明显感觉到电车正在向下行驶，随后他们所在的隧道也消失了。

Asuka knew that the Geofront was large, and that there were people who specifically maintained the environment of it, but she had never guessed that it was so vast underneath.  
明日香知道第三新东京市地下空间非常庞大，并且有专人负责维护其环境，但她从未料到地下竟然如此广阔。

It couldn't be called a room, more like an area.  
这不能称之为房间，更像是一个区域。

The tram now rolled along the metal tracks several hundred feet in the air, and Asuka looked out one of the side windows to peer down. Admittedly, there wasn't much to see. Just darkness really. She guessed now they were directly underneath the Geofront, and looking up out of the window, she saw the metal ceiling above them. Frowning slightly, she saw many tubes crisscrossing under each other, and wondered if this didn't have something to do with the man made lake.  
电车此刻正沿着数百英尺高空的金属轨道行驶，明日香透过一扇侧窗向下望去。坦白说，并没有太多可看的，只有一片黑暗。她猜测现在他们正位于第三新东京市地下的正下方，抬头望向窗外，她看到了头顶的金属天花板。微微皱眉，她注意到许多管道纵横交错，不禁猜测这些是否与人工湖有关。

"We're almost there," said Misato suddenly, pulling Asuka away from her thoughts.  
“我们快到了。”美里突然说道，将明日香从思绪中拉回。

"Okay." “好的。”

Turning away from the window, she rested her elbows on her knees and placed her chin in the palms of her hands as she waited for the tram to stop.  
她从窗边转过身，双肘撑在膝盖上，手掌托着下巴，等待电车停下。

---

Shinji didn't think this was an elevator. No certainly not!  
真嗣不认为这是个电梯。绝对不是！

In reality, it was just a giant metal shaft that descended into the lower reaches of Nerv and more importantly, Terminal Dogma. Shinji guessed that it had been built especially for the use of the Evangelions.  
实际上，它只是一个巨大的金属竖井，通向 NERV 的深处，更重要的是，通往最终教条区。真嗣猜测这是专门为使用 EVA 而建造的。

As he gripped the controls of Unit 01, he thought about what he was going to do.  
当他紧握初号机的控制器时，他想到了自己将要做什么。

Kill Kaoru. 杀死薰。

He didn't see any other options than that simple fact. Yes he believed what Kaoru had said, yes he understood that humans were stubborn, selfish, and possibly evil at times. But exterminating the whole race just so that the Tree of Life, or whatever bullshit it was could stay alive? Fuck that! He wouldn't, and couldn't allow it. Maybe he was just like all the other humans: selfish. But he didn't want to lose anybody else dear to him.  
除此之外，他没有看到其他选择。是的，他相信薰所说的话，是的，他理解人类固执、自私，有时甚至可能是邪恶的。但为了所谓的生命之树——管它是什么鬼东西——而灭绝整个人类种族？去他妈的！他不会，也不能允许这种事发生。也许他和所有其他人类一样自私。但他不想再失去任何一个他珍爱的人。

And then there was the angel part of him screaming to not kill Kaoru. It told him to sympathize with the angels, and to listen earnestly to what they had to say. Shinji was afraid of this small voice in the back of his head, because as he was now, he might just listen to it.  
然后，他内心天使的那部分在尖叫，不要杀薰。它告诉他要同情天使们，并认真聆听他们要说的话。真嗣害怕这个脑海深处的小声音，因为以他现在的状态，他可能会听从它。

His eyes had not changed back yet, and he was worried that his angel self might completely control him soon. And even if he killed Kaoru...then what? Seele surely wouldn't back down with the death of there agent. It seemed that Kaoru was going against what they desired right now, so Shinji supposed he would be killed by them anyway. But he didn't like it. He found himself wishing that him and Kaoru could have been friends, but because of who Kaoru was, and who Shinji was, it just never seemed possible.  
他的眼睛还未变回原样，他担心自己的天使形态可能很快就会完全控制他。即便他杀了薰……然后呢？Seele 肯定不会因为他们的特工之死而罢手。看来薰现在正违背他们的意愿，所以真嗣猜想自己无论如何都会被他们干掉。但他不喜欢这样。他发现自己希望他和薰能成为朋友，但因为薰的身份，以及他自己的身份，这似乎永远不可能。

"Is it completely pointless then?" asked Shinji to nobody in particular. "I've already lost Asuka, then I lost Ayanami. Who is next? Misato? Ritsuko seems to have been confined somewhere."  
“那么，这一切完全没意义吗？”真嗣自言自语道，“我已经失去了明日香，然后又失去了绫波。下一个是谁？美里？律子似乎已经被关押在某处。”

Shinji felt like all his hope was being swept away by some powerful force, but it was simply his own feelings of helplessness that were doing this. No matter what kind of power he had acquired, he was still Shinji Ikari, a fifteen year old boy that had been trust forward into a position he didn't want.  
真嗣感觉所有的希望都被某种强大的力量卷走，但这不过是自己的无助感在作祟。无论他获得了何种力量，他依然是碇真嗣，一个十五岁的少年，被推到了一个他并不想要的境地。

'I hate it all,' he thought. 'Everybody that pushed me into this. Father, Fuyutsuki, Ritsuko, Misato, Ayanami, Asuka...Asuka...'  
“我恨这一切，”他心想，“所有把我推到这一步的人。父亲、冬月、律子、美里、绫波、明日香……明日香……”

He mumbled her name last, her of which he had connected, and then lost. What existed was now gone, and for fear of what might happen, he would never pursue that again.  
他最后喃喃念出她的名字，那个他曾与之相连，又失去的人。曾经存在的一切如今已消失，出于对可能发生之事的恐惧，他再也不会去追求了。

But most of all, he supposed he hated himself. Who he was, with this disgusting feeling of being neither human or angel.  
但归根结底，他想他最恨的是自己。那个既非人类也非天使，带着这令人作呕感觉的自己。

"Its there fault," he muttered, "I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for them. I hate them..."  
“都是他们的错，”他喃喃自语，“如果不是他们，我根本不会在这里。我恨他们……”

Though that wasn't true. Only Shinji Ikari could decide what Shinji Ikari wanted to do. What decisions led him to this point was something only Shinji Ikari had decided upon. Could he still be influenced by the people around him? Certainly! But ultimately, it was still his decision on what to do.  
尽管那并不完全正确。只有碇真嗣能决定碇真嗣想做什么。是什么决定让他走到了这一步，只有碇真嗣自己才能决定。他还能被周围的人影响吗？当然可以！但最终，他还是要自己决定该怎么做。

He blamed them anyway though, because it was easier than accepting the fact that this reality was something he brought about. Did he loath it? Maybe, but he didn't know what the other possibilities were. Were there just a billions different realities with a Shinji Ikari making decisions and changing everything based on these decisions? Maybe, but this was the reality of this Shinji Ikari, and not another. He had to except what it was. Even if everybody else threw him away, even if everybody else ignored him, even if everybody else shunned and kicked him, he would still-  
尽管如此，他还是把责任推给了他们，因为接受这个现实是他自己造成的，比承认这一点要容易得多。他讨厌这个现实吗？也许吧，但他不知道其他的可能性是什么。是否存在数十亿个不同的现实，每个现实都有一个碇真嗣在做决定，并根据这些决定改变一切？也许吧，但这是这个碇真嗣的现实，而不是另一个。他必须接受它是什么。即使其他人都抛弃了他，即使其他人都忽视了他，即使其他人都排斥和踢打他，他仍然会——

"So it doesn't matter," said Shinji uncaringly as he regained control of himself, throwing away these thoughts. "I'm myself, myself as Shinji Ikari. Whatever people think about me...doesn't matter, because I know who I am. Even if everybody forgets me, I won't forget myself...so it doesn't matter."  
"所以这无关紧要，" 真嗣无所谓地说道，他重新控制住自己，抛开了这些念头。"我就是我，作为碇真嗣的我。无论别人怎么看待我……都无关紧要，因为我清楚自己是谁。即使所有人都忘记了我，我也不会忘记自己……所以这无关紧要。"

Smiling slightly at this thought, he shook his head trying to rid himself of his weakness. But human weakness doesn't disappear, rather, people learn to cope with it. Since that is something unique to humans.  
想到这里，他微微一笑，摇了摇头试图摆脱自己的软弱。但人类的弱点并不会消失，相反，人们学会了与之共处。因为这是人类独有的特质。

"The possibility to adapt, change, and understand themselves and others around them," said Shinji.  
"适应、改变和理解自己及周围人的可能性，" 真嗣说道。

He had to reassure himself, for if he didn't, he would surely lose his humanity. Even with this angel half of him, he would stay human. He would learnt to cope with it, even if he has seclude himself off from the rest of the world for ten or twenty years, he would control it.  
他不得不安慰自己，因为如果不这样做，他肯定会失去人性。即使他拥有天使的一半，他仍会保持人性。他会学会应对，即使他必须与世隔绝十年或二十年，他也会控制住自己。

"So I'll believe that everybody can change, just as I believe that I myself can change."  
“所以我愿意相信每个人都能改变，正如我相信我自己也能改变一样。”

Shaking off these worries, he plunged forward into the depths of Terminal Dogma.  
抛开这些忧虑，他毅然深入到终端教义的核心。

---

Kaoru looked up almost as though he could hear these words spoken by Shinji.  
薰抬起头，几乎像是能听到真嗣说出这些话一样。

Smiling, he turned towards Unit 02 and nodded slightly. Unit 02 suddenly stopped descending in and seemed to hover there, as though waiting for something.  
他微笑着转向二号机，微微点头。二号机突然停止了下降，似乎悬浮在那里，仿佛在等待什么。

Kaoru meanwhile, turned his back on Unit 02 who he had ordered to wait for Unit 01 and continued into Terminal Dogma. He could feel it now, before it had been brief, but certainly now-  
与此同时，薰背对着他命令等待初号机的二号机，继续向中央教条区走去。他现在能感觉到了，之前只是短暂的，但现在确实——

"Looks like Lilith is getting impatient."  
“看来莉莉丝开始不耐烦了。”

---

Asuka and Misato stepped out of the tram and hurried across the platform to the other side where Misato pounded the button on the elevator to take them to the upper floors.  
明日香和美里走出电车，快步穿过站台，来到对面，美里按下电梯按钮，准备带她们前往上层。

'Jeez,' thought Asuka as she looked at her reflection of the elevator door, 'I really look terrible.'  
“天哪，”明日香看着电梯门上映出的自己，心想，“我真的看起来很糟糕。”

Since Misato had told her to just throw something on before they had left her apartment, she didn't have time to do anything with her hair. Simply put, it looked like a mop after somebody was done cleaning up spilled juice that was bright red.  
由于美里告诉她在离开公寓前随便套件衣服就行，她没时间打理头发。简单来说，那样子就像有人清理完洒出来的鲜红色果汁后留下的拖把。

The door opened then though, so Asuka didn't get any more time to examine her reflection.  
然而，门这时打开了，所以明日香没有更多时间审视自己的倒影。

They both hurried into the elevator, and Misato hammered on one the button that would take them to the upper floors. Asuka didn't really pay attention to what button she had pressed, as she was leaning against the back wall of the elevator and looking up at the brightly lit ceiling.  
她们俩匆忙进入电梯，美里猛按下通往高层的按钮。明日香并没有注意她按的是哪个按钮，因为她正靠在电梯后墙上，抬头望着明亮的顶灯。

'Why did I come along again?' she wondered.  
"'我为什么又跟来了呢？' 她暗自思忖。

Letting out a low sigh, she tried flattening her hair so that it wouldn't stick up as bad, but without a mirror in front of her, she had no idea how her efforts had faired.  
"她轻轻叹了口气，试图压平头发，以免翘得太厉害，但没有镜子在面前，她完全不知道自己的努力效果如何。

As the door opened, Asuka expected to step out into the command center, but was surprised to see that she was standing in a long hallway with many doors along both walls. The flooring was tiled which made her realize.  
"当门打开时，明日香本以为会走进指挥中心，却惊讶地发现自己站在一条长长的走廊里，两侧墙壁上排列着许多门。地面的瓷砖让她恍然大悟。

"Why are we on this floor? Isn't this part of the Medical District?"  
"我们为什么在这一层？这不是医疗区的一部分吗？"

"It is, but I have something to take care of here first," said Misato while shifting her eyes slightly. Asuka however, didn't notice this.  
"是的，但我在这里有些事情要先处理，" Misato 说着，眼神微微一转。然而，Asuka 并没有注意到这一点。

"C'mon, its this way," said Misato encouragingly.  
"来吧，这边走，" Misato 鼓励地说道。

Asuka, not knowing what else to do, shrugged her shoulders and followed Misato without complaint.  
明日香不知所措，只好耸耸肩，毫无怨言地跟着美里。

After several minutes of walking along the right side of the hallway, Misato paused in front of a door that was slightly open. Asuka looked at the side of the door where names of the patients usually were, but didn't see one.  
沿着走廊右侧走了几分钟后，美里在一扇微微敞开的门前停下。明日香看向通常标有病人名字的门侧，却没有看到任何名字。

"Misato...whats this about?"  
“美里……这是怎么回事？”

"Don't worry, this will only take a second," said Misato as she grabbed Asuka's wrist in a vice like grip.  
"别担心，这只需要一秒钟，" 美里说着，用铁钳般的力道抓住了明日香的手腕。

"Misato what are you!" "美里，你这是干什么！"

Misato dragged Asuka into the room quickly and spun her around, making her fall on the bed against the far right wall of the room.  
美里迅速将明日香拖进房间，转身一甩，让她跌倒在房间最右侧的床上。

"Misato!" "美里！"

"Sorry Asuka," said Misato glumly. "But I can't have you in the command center this time...so I need you to stay here until-"  
"对不起，明日香。" 美里沮丧地说，"但这次我不能让你进入指挥中心...所以你需要留在这里直到-"

"No! Absolutely not! Why the hell do you think I even came here-"  
"不行！绝对不行！你以为我为什么要来这里-"

'No...wait...why did I-' '不...等等...我为什么——'

"I'm sorry Asuka. While I did allow you to come here contrary to what I said before, I can't allow you to be in the command center this time."  
"对不起，明日香。虽然我之前说的话相反，但还是让你来了这里，但这次我不能让你进入指挥中心。"

"And why is that!" Asuka yelled back at her.  
"那又是为什么！" 明日香对她吼道。

Misato bit her lip in frustration as she stood in the door way, blocking Asuka. In truth, it was because she was unsure how Shinji would react if he saw Asuka at a time like this. She didn't want anything to happen to him because he was shaken about seeing her. Maybe after...he was all done, but not now.  
美里咬着嘴唇，站在门口挡住明日香，心中其实是因为不确定真嗣在这种情况下见到明日香会有什么反应。她不想因为真嗣见到她而受到动摇，从而发生什么意外。也许等他……一切都结束了，但现在不行。

"I just can't!" yelled Misato back at Asuka, startling her so much that she started moving a few seconds to late, during which Misato had already ran out of the room and closed the door, locking it from the outside.  
“我就是做不到！”美里对着明日香大喊，吓得她迟了几秒才反应过来，而这时美里已经跑出房间，从外面关上门并锁上了。

Misato leaned against the door catching her breath as she felt Asuka smiting the door with her fist, screaming at Misato to let her out.  
美里靠在门上喘着气，感觉到明日香用拳头捶打着门，尖叫着让美里放她出去。

'I did the right thing...right?' thought Misato.  
“我做的是对的...对吧？”美里心想。

Even now, she wasn't sure, but she couldn't change her mind now.  
即便此刻，她仍不确定，但已无法改变主意。

Pushing herself off the door, she ran back down the hallway where the elevator was, preparing herself for whatever Shinji was dealing with.  
她从门边起身，跑回电梯所在的走廊，准备面对真嗣所经历的一切。

Asuka meanwhile, had given up trying to break down the door and her string of cuss words aimed at Misato had long abated. Kneeling in front of the door, her fists were still pressed against the cold surface of the door, but she gave no sign of hitting it again.  
与此同时，明日香已经放弃了破门的尝试，对美里连珠炮似的咒骂也早已停止。她跪在门前，双拳依旧紧贴着冰冷的门面，却没有再次击打的迹象。

"Why...why does everyone keep lying to me?" mumbled Asuka.  
“为什么……为什么每个人都一直对我撒谎？”明日香喃喃自语。

Pearly white tears starting falling from her eyes, and fell off her long eyelashes as she closed her eyes in depression.  
晶莹的泪珠开始从她的眼中滑落，当她沮丧地闭上眼睛时，泪水顺着她长长的睫毛滴落。

"Everyone...everyone keeps lying to me...not letting me know whats going on and..."  
“每个人...每个人都在对我撒谎...不让我知道发生了什么...”

She slowly unclenched her fists and let her hands slide down the smooth surface of the door. Sliding backwards, she pressed her back against the metal bars of the bed holding the mattress in place, and drew her knees up to her face. Folding her arms across her knees, she buried her face in them and quietly wept.  
她缓缓松开紧握的拳头，双手顺着门的光滑表面滑下。她向后退去，背靠在固定床垫的金属床栏上，将膝盖蜷缩至脸前。双臂环抱膝盖，她将脸埋入其中，静静地啜泣。

---

Shinji continued descending into Terminal Dogma with Unit 01.  
真嗣继续与初号机一同深入终端教条区。

In front of him was Unit 02.  
在他面前的是 02 号机。

'Damn it,' he thought. 'I don't want to damage Asuka's unit...but I don't think I have a choice.'  
“该死，”他心想，“我不想损坏明日香的机体……但我觉得我没有选择。”

Making Unit 01 reach behind itself towards the shoulders holsters in its back, he withdrew the prog knife.  
让 01 号机伸手到背后，从背部的肩部枪套中抽出进度刀。

In front of him, Unit 02 mimicked his movements precisely.  
在他面前，二号机准确地模仿着他的每一个动作。

'Tch, didn't think this would be very easy.'  
“啧，没想到会这么棘手。”

Continuing to draw closer to Unit 02 as he continued soaring downward into Central Dogma, he made Unit 01 draw its right arm close to its body with the prog knife in its hand, ready to lash out in a moments notice.  
他继续向二号机靠近，同时高速下坠进入中央教条区，让初号机将握有进度刀的右臂紧贴身体，随时准备出击。

Again mimicking his movements exactly, Unit 02 drew its prog knife close to its body with its right arm.  
又一次精确模仿他的动作，二号机将右臂上的程序刀贴近机身。

'Why is it mimicking everything I do?' thought Shinji. 'And where is Kaoru? Shouldn't he be here?'  
“为什么它要模仿我的一切动作？”真嗣心想，“而且薰在哪里？他不应该在这里吗？”

Before he had any more time to think about this though, Unit 01 and 02 clashed.  
然而，还没等他再多想，零一和零二机便猛烈相撞。

The right arm of Unit 02 shot outward from the side of its chest suddenly and darted towards Unit 01, the prog knifes point aimed at Unit 01's chest cavity. Reacting instinctively, Shinji made Unit 01 turn its prog knife on its side, and brought it up in a defensive position in front of its chest. The two prog knifes collided amidst a shower of sparks. Unit 02's prog knife stabbed into Unit 01 prog knife, and Shinji could almost feel the sparks skipping off Unit 01's hand. Gripping the prog knife with the left hand of Unit 01 now, he threw both arms up into the air, sending Unit 02's prog knife spinning out of its grasp, and created an opening in Unit 02's defensives. Letting go of the prog knife in its right hand he continued holding onto it in his left hand and quickly drew Unit 01's fist backwards, and thrust it towards Unit 02's chest. Millimeters away from it though, Unit 02 generated an AT-field.  
零二号的右臂突然从胸侧伸出，直奔零一号，推进刀尖瞄准了零一号的胸腔。本能反应下，真嗣操控零一号将推进刀侧转，举至胸前防御。两把推进刀在火花四溅中相撞。零二号的推进刀刺入零一号的推进刀，真嗣几乎能感觉到火花从零一号的手上跳跃。他用零一号的左手紧握推进刀，双臂猛地向上挥起，使零二号的推进刀脱手飞出，打开了零二号的防御缺口。他松开右手的推进刀，继续用左手握住，迅速将零一号的拳头后拉，猛地向零二号的胸口击去。但在毫厘之间，零二号生成了 AT 力场。

"AT-field?" mumbled Shinji, "but I didn't think the Eva's were able to create an AT-field without a pilot. Unless it doesn't need to because of Kaoru being an angel..."  
“AT 力场？”真嗣喃喃自语，“但我没想到 EVA 能在没有驾驶员的情况下生成 AT 力场。除非是因为薰是天使，它不需要……”

Now letting go of the prog knife in Unit 01's left hand, he tossed it away to the side and let it fall at its own pace into Terminal Dogma. Generating Unit 01's AT-field, he slammed it against Unit 02's, destroying it instantly.  
现在松开了初号机左手中的程序刀，他将其抛向一旁，任由它自行坠入终端教条区。生成初号机的 AT 力场，他猛地将其撞击在二号机的力场上，瞬间将其摧毁。

'I suppose its to be expected that Unit 02 wont have as strong an AT-field as Unit 01,' thought Shinji before he made Unit 01 pull back its left fist and swung it forward.  
“我想二号机的 AT 力场没有初号机那么强也是正常的，”真嗣心想，随后让初号机收回左拳，猛地向前挥出。

Unit 01's fist struck against the left side of Unit 02's jaw, snapping the cheekbone and spraying blood and gore out of Unit 02's mouth. Shinji felt a slight searing in his own hand in response to the force used by Unit 01 to strike Unit 02.  
初号机的拳头击中了二号机左颚的侧面，折断了颧骨，鲜血和碎肉从二号机的口中喷溅而出。真嗣感到自己的手因初号机击打二号机的力量而微微灼痛。

Still in a free fall, Unit 01 grabbed the shoulder holsters of Unit 02 and pushed it downwards, using it as something as a cushion for when the impact with the ground happened. Still seeming to function though, Unit 02 brought both its arms up rather shakily, and gripped Unit 01's throat with the remaining strength left in its body. Feeling the his own throat being constricted because of his synchronization with Unit 01, he oxygen to his brain started being cut off. Knowing he only had a few seconds before he lost consciousness, he briefly thought, 'Sorry about this Asuka...'  
仍在自由落体中的 01 号机抓住了 02 号机的肩部枪套，将其向下推，试图在撞击地面时将其作为缓冲。尽管看似仍在运作，02 号机颤抖着举起双臂，用仅存的力量紧紧扼住 01 号机的喉咙。由于与 01 号机的同步，他感到自己的喉咙被勒紧，大脑的氧气供应开始被切断。意识到自己几秒钟后就会失去意识，他短暂地想道：“抱歉了，明日香……”

With Unit 01's hands still holding the shoulder holsters of Unit 02, like paper being torn down the middle, Unit 02's flesh was rent. The left hand of Unit 01 pulled the left shoulder holster outward as though trying to bend it, while the right hand did likewise on the other holster. Both holsters were pulled outward until the arms weren't able to contain the strain anymore. From the joint connecting the arm to the main body, a small tear opened in which blood gushed forth. Seconds later, both the right and left arm of Unit 02 popped off like a dolls. Blood and gore leaked out of the open wound while large chunks of flesh fell off the discarded arm as they were thrown to the side. Bone stuck out of both sides Unit 02 where the arms had been as small bits of yellow marrow leaked forth. Shinji had to look away at this sight, horrified at what he had done with his own hands. Unit 02's grip on Unit 01 throat slackened as it seemed to fall backwards, relinquishing its grip on Unit 01's throat, enabling the oxygen to flow to Shinji's brain again.  
零一的手依旧紧握着零二肩上的枪套，仿佛撕裂纸张般，零二的血肉被撕开。零一的左手将左肩枪套向外拉扯，试图将其弯曲，右手亦对另一侧枪套如法炮制。两个枪套被拉扯至极限，双臂再也无法承受这股张力。从连接手臂与躯干的关节处，一道小裂口绽开，鲜血喷涌而出。片刻后，零二的左右臂如同玩偶般弹飞出去。血肉模糊的伤口中，大块肉块随之甩落，骨头从零二两侧裸露出来，黄色骨髓渗出。真嗣不得不移开视线，对自己亲手造成的惨状感到恐惧。零二对零一喉咙的钳制逐渐松懈，似乎向后倒去，放开了对零一喉咙的束缚，让氧气再次流向真嗣的大脑。

Watching the eyes of Unit 02 lose their green hue was oddly foreboding, as it made him think of how Asuka would react to this. Certainly it would take a while to have Unit 02 repaired.  
看着 02 号机眼中失去绿色光泽，不知为何让他预感不妙，这让他不禁思考明日香对此会有何反应。当然，修复 02 号机还需要一段时间。

'No, I shouldn't worry about that. Besides, its better that she never pilots again.'  
'不，我不该为此担心。再说，她不再驾驶反而更好。'

Ignoring Unit 02 who continued falling beside him, he was just thinking about how he should confront Kaoru when he felt something beside him.  
他无视了继续在他身旁坠落的 02 号机，只是在思考该如何面对薰时，突然感觉到身边有什么动静。

"What the hel-" was all he got out of his mouth before Unit 02's AT-field crashed into Unit 01.  
“这他妈——”他刚开口，就被零二号的 AT 力场猛地撞上了零一号。

Shinji coughed up blood as he felt as though a cinderblock had just been thrown at his chest. At most he hoped nothing had ruptured inside of him, but it felt as though a few of his ribs had been broken.  
真嗣咳出血来，感觉像是胸口被扔了一块水泥砖。他只希望内脏没有破裂，但感觉几根肋骨可能已经断了。

Looking at the reactivated Unit 02 who's eyes were radiating a bright green again, Shinji couldn't help but feel slightly afraid. Unit 02 was...different, it simply felt different then a few minutes ago. But it didn't feel like it had anything to do with Kaoru.  
看着重新启动的零二号，它的眼睛再次放射出明亮的绿色光芒，真嗣不禁感到一丝恐惧。零二号……不一样了，和几分钟前的感觉截然不同。但这似乎与薰无关。

Blood continued gushing out of the sides of Unit 02, but it didn't seem to care as its AT-field continued pressing against Unit 01.  
血液继续从二号机的两侧喷涌而出，但它似乎毫不在意，其 AT 力场继续向初号机施压。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji, 'why is Unit 02 acting like this? Its like...it suddenly went berserk.'  
'该死，' 真嗣心想，'为什么二号机会这样行动？就好像...它突然发狂了一样。'

Coughing up another fresh pint of blood, Shinji hastily wiped a trickle of it that slowly started cascading down his face. Grabbing the controls of Unit 01, he quickly generated an AT-field, and slowly managed to push Unit 02's AT-field.  
真嗣又咳出一口新鲜的血，急忙擦去缓缓从脸上流下的一缕血迹。他抓住初号机的控制器，迅速生成 AT 力场，并慢慢将二号机的 AT 力场推了回去。

'How is it that the AT-field is stronger than before?' wondered Shinji.  
'为什么 AT 力场比之前更强了？' 真嗣疑惑道。

He didn't want to damage Unit 02 anymore, but he didn't see any other way of stopping it. Now raising Unit 01's right hand, he clasped it into a fist, and swung it at the gaping hole in Unit 02's right side. Like a cannon being fired, the air from the force of Unit 01's fist forced itself out the other side of Unit 02, spraying blood and tissue everywhere.  
他不想再对二号机造成更多伤害，但似乎没有其他办法阻止它。现在，他举起初号机的右手，握成拳头，朝着二号机右侧的裂口猛击过去。如同炮弹发射一般，初号机拳头的力量将空气从二号机的另一侧挤出，四处喷溅着血液和组织碎片。

Even that didn't seem to stop the rampaging Unit 02.  
即便如此，狂暴的二号机似乎仍未停下。

Its head swiveled left and right without its muscles seeming to work properly, making it wobble from side to side. It seemed that most of its tendons and nerve endings had been severed.  
它的头部左右转动，肌肉却似乎无法正常工作，导致它左右摇晃。看起来它的大部分肌腱和神经末梢都已被切断。

"Stop it already!" shouted Shinji surprising even himself at this sudden outburst of emotions. "You can't even function properly...and I don't want to-"  
“别再这样了！”真嗣大喊道，连他自己都惊讶于这突如其来的情绪爆发。“你连正常运作都做不到……我也不想——”

Unit 02's AT-field shot outward again, but this time it was so weak that Shinji was able to brush it aside with nothing but a quick wave of Unit 01's right hand.  
初号机的 AT 力场再次向外扩散，但这次弱到真嗣只需用二号机右手轻轻一挥就能将其拨开。

"I don't even know what you're trying to do! Kaoru's not controlling you anymore, and Asuka may not even be able to pilot again! So why are you going to such lengths to try and stop me!"  
"我甚至不知道你到底想干什么！绫波已经不再控制你了，而明日香可能再也无法驾驶了！那你为什么还要如此大费周章地试图阻止我！"

The only answer he got was Unit 02 feebly trying to create another AT-field.  
他得到的唯一回应是二号机无力地试图再次展开 AT 力场。

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "Fine then..."  
真嗣摇了摇头，说道：“好吧，那就算了……”

Raising Unit 01's right arm, he turned his gaze away as he brought it down moments later, intending to slice Unit 02's head clean off, making sure that it ceased functioning. The AT-field generated, and soared towards Unit 02, intending to lop of its head at the neck. But-  
他举起 01 号机的右臂，目光移开，片刻后猛地挥下，意图干净利落地斩断 02 号机的头颅，确保其停止运作。AT 力场随即生成，向 02 号机疾驰而去，意在切断其颈部。但——

"Don't!" “住手！”

Unit 01 instantly stopped when it heard that voice, because it was Shinji that had stopped it. He froze, and felt a cold sweat emanate throughout his whole body at the sound of that voice. Adrenaline surged through his body...but no, how could he hear that voice of all times.  
01 号机听到那个声音后立刻停了下来，因为那是真嗣的声音。他僵住了，听到那个声音时全身冷汗直冒。肾上腺素涌遍全身……但怎么可能，偏偏在这个时候听到那个声音。

"Asu...ka?" he whispered towards Unit 02, for he was sure that was where the voice came from.  
"明日香？" 他对着二号机低语，因为他确信声音是从那里传来的。

Unit 02 had stopped moving however, and even though its eyes still seared with that green light, its entire body seemed to be frozen.  
然而，二号机已经停止了移动，尽管它的眼睛依旧闪烁着那绿色的光芒，但整个机体似乎都被冻结了。

"Asuka?" Shinji repeated, a little more force in his voice this time.  
"明日香？" 真嗣再次呼唤，这次他的声音中多了几分坚定。

Silence still greeted his words, but he thought he realized something then.  
他的话语依旧没有得到回应，但他觉得自己似乎明白了些什么。

"Ahh...I get it...you hate me, don't you?" asked Shinji.  
“啊……我明白了……你讨厌我，对吧？”真嗣问道。

Shinji thought he understood a little. The Evangelions after all had human souls in them, and Unit 02 was no different. Somebody important to Asuka had to be residing inside Unit 02, at least he assumed. If that was true, he could understand how the remaining feelings of this person may hate him.  
真嗣觉得自己理解了一些。毕竟，EVA 里寄宿着人类的灵魂，二号机也不例外。他猜想，对明日香来说重要的人一定在二号机里。如果这是真的，他就能理解这个人残留的情感为何会讨厌他了。

"For everything I did to her...I'm sorry, and I know that I can't take anything back...but-"  
"对于我为她所做的一切...我很抱歉，我知道我无法挽回任何事...但是-"

"Don't apologize..." "不要道歉..."

Shinji's eyes open so wide that they looked as though they might pop out. The voice again, which was almost exactly like Asuka's. But it wasn't...and this time he thought he saw something else. Maybe it was because of him being part angel, or having something to do with his strong synchronization with Unit 01. Or maybe it simply had to do with the relationship him and Asuka had had. But he saw somebody inside Unit 02...no, that wasn't quite right. It was more like he could feel it, even if it was just a brief glimpse.  
真嗣的眼睛睁得如此之大，仿佛要弹出来一般。那个声音再次响起，几乎和明日香的一模一样。但并不是她...这一次，他觉得自己看到了别的东西。也许是因为他有一半天使的血统，或者与他与 01 号机强大的同步率有关。又或许，这仅仅与他和明日香之间的关系有关。但他看到了 02 号机内部...不，这并不完全正确。更像是他能感觉到它，尽管只是一瞥。

It was a woman, in her late twenties by the look it. She had short red hair that reached just above her shoulders, while her eyes were a deep blue.  
那是一位女性，看上去二十七八岁的样子。她留着齐肩的短发，红得耀眼，而她的眼睛则是深邃的蓝色。

She looked like Asuka in certain aspects and sounded almost exactly alike, but Shinji could also see how they were unlike. But they were still related, because this woman was-  
她在某些方面与明日香颇为相似，声音也几乎一模一样，但碇真嗣也能看出她们的不同之处。不过，她们之间仍有血缘关系，因为这位女性是——

'You're...Asuka's mother...' mouthed Shinji, his voice apparently gone from his surprise.  
'你是...明日香的妈妈...' 碇真嗣喃喃道，声音因惊讶而显得微弱。

He didn't get an answer of yes or no though, but it seemed that Unit 02 wasn't able to remain hovering any longer. Its eyes finally lost their green glow, and slowly, Unit 02 started falling backwards, gathering speed as it continued falling.  
他没有得到肯定或否定的回答，但似乎二号机已经无法继续悬浮了。它的眼睛最终失去了绿色的光芒，慢慢地，二号机开始向后坠落，随着下落速度不断加快。

'Shit,' thought Shinji. 'I can't...'  
'该死，' 真嗣心想。'我不能...'

Wincing slightly as pain coursed through him because of his broken ribs, he forced Unit 01 down towards the falling Unit 02. Throwing Unit 01's right arm forward, he tried grabbing onto on of the legs of Unit 02.  
由于断裂的肋骨带来的疼痛，他微微皱眉，强迫初号机向正在坠落的二号机俯冲下去。他伸出初号机的右臂，试图抓住二号机的一条腿。

'After what I did,' he thought, 'and after knowing how important this is to Asuka...I can't just let this happen.'  
‘经历了我所做的一切，’他心想，‘以及知道这对明日香有多重要……我不能就这样袖手旁观。’

Stretching Unit 01's arm further then it was intended to be stretched, Shinji could feel the strain it put on his own arm as his joints were screaming in pain. With one final lunge, Shinji managed to grab Unit 02's left leg with the right hand of Unit 01. Pulling the bloody and dismembered body towards Unit 01, he wrapped both of Unit 01's arms around its midsection.  
将初号机的手臂拉伸到超出设计极限，真嗣能感受到自己的手臂因压力而疼痛，关节在痛苦中尖叫。最后奋力一跃，真嗣用初号机的右手抓住了零号机左腿。他将那血肉模糊、肢体残缺的身体拉向初号机，用双臂紧紧环抱住其腰部。

Letting out a deep breath, Shinji relaxed his body as Unit 01 continued holding onto Unit 02.  
深吸一口气，真嗣放松了身体，初号机继续紧紧抱住零号机。

'Why is it...that it almost feels like I'm embracing Asuka?'  
'为什么...这感觉几乎像是我在拥抱明日香？'

He didn't know what it was, but he felt something. Maybe it was a small piece of his lingering feelings towards her, almost completely eclipsed by his angel half. Maybe it was remorse over what he had just done. Maybe it was simply that he was feeling lonely, and in a way, Unit 02 was a piece of Asuka's heart.  
他不知道这是什么感觉，但他确实感受到了。或许是他对她残留的一丝情感，几乎被他的天使部分完全掩盖。或许是他对刚刚所做之事的悔恨。或许只是因为他感到孤独，而某种程度上，二号机是明日香心灵的一部分。

"I don't even know anymore," he mumbled, as he continued descending into Terminal Dogma.  
“我甚至都不明白了，”他喃喃自语，继续向最终教条区深处走去。

---

Kaoru all but ignored the slot where a pass card was supposed to be swiped, and tore the door of its hinges with his AT-field, tossing it to the side. Hovering inches off the ground, he made his way into Lilith's chamber.  
小薰几乎无视了本应刷通行卡的插槽，用他的 AT 力场将门从铰链上撕下，扔到一旁。他悬浮在离地面几英寸的地方，进入了莉莉丝的房间。

Before him rested a giant figure nailed to a cross as the Son of God had been. It was purely white except for a purple mask that it wore with an upside down triangle on it. However, the mask had a large crack in it travel from the top all the way down, splitting the triangle in half. The track seemed to be a simple of defiance.  
在他面前，一个巨大的身影被钉在十字架上，就像上帝之子曾经那样。它全身纯白，除了戴着一副紫色的面具，上面有一个倒三角形。然而，面具上有一道从上到下的大裂缝，将三角形一分为二。这条裂缝似乎是一种反抗的象征。

As Kaoru continued hovering forward, looking up at the giant angel that was Lilith a wide smile spread across his face.  
随着小薰继续向前悬浮，抬头望着那巨大的天使——莉莉丝，他的脸上绽放出一个灿烂的笑容。

"We finally meet Lilith."  
"我们终于见到莉莉丝了。"

Surprisingly, a voice answered him.  
出乎意料地，一个声音回应了他。

"Tabris...or should I call you Adam?"  
"塔布里斯...或者我该称你为亚当？"

The voice that was pleasant one-second, changed to hostile the next as it mentioned the hated name of Adam. The voice didn't come from any particular place, it simply existed.  
那声音前一秒还悦耳动听，下一秒提到亚当这个令人憎恶的名字时，就变得充满敌意。这声音并非来自某个特定的地方，它就那样存在着。

"Call me Tabris," said Kaoru, "since I am not Adam, but simply house the soul of Adam."  
"叫我塔布里斯吧，"薰说道，"因为我并非亚当，只是承载着亚当的灵魂。"

"Well you sure are arrogant like he was," scoffed the soul of Lilith. "So? Are you going to follow those geezers, or do you have a mind of your own?"  
"哼，你确实和他一样自大，"莉莉丝的灵魂嘲讽道，"那么？你是打算追随那些老家伙，还是自己有主见？"

Kaoru continued smiling, but for a second it seemed to wane slightly.  
薰继续微笑着，但有那么一瞬间，笑容似乎稍稍减弱了些。

"I've decided what I want to do on my own, and besides they don't factor into what the angels wanted."  
“我已经决定了自己想做的事情，而且除此之外，他们并不符合天使们的要求。”

"Still stubbornly following your father I see," said Lilith.  
“看来你还是固执地追随你父亲啊，”莉莉丝说道。

"The same could be said of you."  
"你也可以这么说。"

"I do everything for the Lilim. It is my own decision. Now...why are you here?"  
"我为莉莉姆做一切。这是我自己的决定。现在...你为什么在这里？"

Kaoru raised an eyebrow in surprise at that.  
薰对此扬起眉毛，感到惊讶。

"Shouldn't Shinji be told everything now?"  
"现在不应该把一切都告诉真嗣吗？"

If Lilith had eyes that could be narrowed, she would have narrowed them.  
如果莉莉丝有能眯起来的眼睛，她早就眯起来了。

"That is not up for you to decide Tabris. You're purpose is almost done, for good or bad, I do not know. If you kill Shinji, then I will kill you. He still has a purpose."  
"这不是你来决定的，塔布里斯。你的使命即将完成，无论是好是坏，我不得而知。如果你杀了真嗣，那么我就会杀了你。他还有他的使命。"

"Is that why you manipulated him in everything he did?"  
"这就是为什么你在他做的每件事上都操纵他吗？"

"I simply gave him hints on what choices to make, or showed him things that may change his path."  
"我只是给他一些选择上的提示，或者展示一些可能改变他道路的事物。"

"Involving yourself with humans was one of the things Adam expressly forbade you to do."  
"插手人类事务，是亚当明确禁止你做的事情之一。"

"So I was supposed to just watch them die out, and if I didn't watch Shinji, then who would have? Not Adam certainly."  
“所以我本该眼睁睁看着他们灭绝，如果我不看护真嗣，那还有谁会呢？肯定不是亚当。”

What Kaoru had guessed seemed to be true. Narrowing his eyes slightly, he asked, "Who is Shinji? He has an angels powers, but has no connection with us."  
薰的猜测似乎是正确的。他微微眯起眼睛，问道：“真嗣是谁？他拥有天使的力量，但与我们毫无关联。”

Lilith was silent for a while before she mouth a few silent words that were only heard by Kaoru.  
莉莉丝沉默了一会儿，然后无声地说了几个字，只有薰听到了。

At her words, Kaoru lowered his head and whispered, "So it is as I thought."  
听了她的话，薰低下头，轻声说道：“果然如我所料。”

"You were in turmoil over having to kill him were you not? It is because you house the soul of Adam."  
“你当时内心很矛盾，不是吗？因为你体内寄宿着亚当的灵魂。”

"What of your container, were is she?"  
“你的容器呢，她在哪里？”

"Ayanami Rei? She left a while ago."  
"绫波零？她一会儿前就离开了。"

"How is it that you are able to move freely without a body? The second container...I didn't feel anything from her, so I had assumed."  
"你是如何在没有身体的情况下自由行动的？第二个容器...我并未从她身上感受到任何东西，所以才这么认为。"

"The second was unique. It gained some self recognition to the point that I could not inhabit it for long."  
"第二个容器很特殊。它获得了一定程度的自我认知，以至于我无法长时间占据它。"

"Is it because of the contact with Shinji?"  
"是因为与真嗣接触的缘故吗？"

"It may be, but it seemed that the DNA it received during the cloning process had a strong sense of self awareness."  
"可能如此，但似乎在克隆过程中接收到的 DNA 具有强烈的自我意识。"

"Then this one is-" "那么这个是——"

"It is new, so the process may be slower. As for why I can move freely without a container, it is because my body is close. I cannot move out of the Tokyo-3 area though."  
"这是新型的，所以过程可能会慢一些。至于为什么我能自由移动而不需要容器，那是因为我的身体接近。不过，我无法离开东京-3 区域。"

Kaoru was silent and wasn't smiling anymore. Sticking his hands in his pockets, he looked up at the body of Lilith and asked, "Will you wait for him?"  
薰沉默了，不再微笑。他将双手插进口袋，抬头望着莉莉丝的躯体问道：“你会等他吗？”

"No, our meeting wont happen till everything ends. I was waiting for you."  
"不，我们的相遇要等到一切结束之后。我是在等你。"

"Then what if I tell him everything. His connection with Adam, that you've been controlling him since his angel powers awoke."  
"那如果我告诉他一切呢。他与亚当的联系，你从他的天使之力觉醒起就一直控制着他。"

"I won't hesitate to kill you right now. You may be the final angel, but don't forget that I am a being above you, and as I said I still can use Shinji. He is important till the end of everything."  
"我会毫不犹豫地现在就杀了你。你或许是最后的天使，但别忘了，我是一个凌驾于你之上的存在，正如我所说，我仍然可以利用真嗣。他直到一切的尽头都是重要的。"

"Then let me ask you this...do you really intend to destroy the Tree of Life and rebuild the earth as yourself at the heart of it."  
"那么让我问你这个问题...你真的打算摧毁生命之树，并以自己为中心重建地球吗？"

Lilith was silent for a minute before she said with something akin to a laugh, "Would it change anything if I told you yes or no?"  
莉莉丝沉默了一会儿，然后带着几分似笑非笑的语气说：“如果我告诉你‘是’或‘不是’，会有什么改变吗？”

Kaoru supposed that it didn't really matter, it wasn't after all something that he would get to decide upon.  
薰认为这其实并不重要，毕竟这不是他能决定的事情。

"So then this is it?" he asked.  
“那么，就这样了吗？”他问道。

"Unless you kill Shinji and we meet again...but I don't think that will happen, and I think you know that yourself. You are an angel gifted with a strong foresight because of Adam's soul, so you should already know how this will end."  
"除非你杀了真嗣，我们再次相见...但我认为那不会发生，你自己也清楚这一点。你是因亚当的灵魂而拥有强大预见力的天使，所以你应该已经知道这一切的结局。"

Kaoru was silent as Lilith said this, but he did already know how it would end up. He had known since he had been born into this world.  
薰在莉莉丝说这些时保持沉默，但他确实已经知道结局会如何。自从他降生到这个世界以来，他就知道了。

"Then we have nothing else to say to each other," said Kaoru, a trace of anger in his voice.  
"那么我们之间没什么好说的了，"薰说道，声音中带着一丝怒意。

"No, we do not," replied Lilith.  
“不，我们没有，”莉莉丝回答道。

Almost as though somebody had opened a window in Lilith's chamber, something like an evil spirit felt as though it just vanished. The power of Lilith couldn't be felt anymore; only the body remained.  
仿佛有人打开了莉莉丝房间的窗户，某种邪恶的气息似乎刚刚消散。莉莉丝的力量已无法感知；只剩下她的躯体。

Kaoru meanwhile continued looking up at the body of Lilith, prolonging the short time he had spent on this planet.  
与此同时，薰继续仰望着莉莉丝的遗体，延长了他在地球上短暂停留的时间。

Suddenly, he felt the life go out of Unit 02 and the control he had over it disappear. Looking up towards Central Dogma, he could tell that Shinji was getting closer. Shaking his head, he looked back at the body of Lilith and mumbled, "I can see my own death...so is that a blessing, or a curse? Well...I suppose it could be both. I wonder what Shinji's death will look like, or will he even be able to see it?"  
突然间，他感觉到二号机的生命力消逝，自己对它的控制也随之消失。抬头望向中央教条区，他能感觉到真嗣正越来越近。他摇了摇头，目光回到莉莉丝的躯体上，喃喃自语：“我能预见自己的死亡……这是福还是祸？或许……两者皆是。不知道真嗣的死亡会是什么样子，他是否也能预见呢？”

Smiling slightly, he shrugged his shoulders and thought, 'Not much to do now except wait.'  
他微微一笑，耸了耸肩，心想：‘现在除了等待，也没什么可做的了。’

Planting his feet firmly on the ground Kaoru remarked on how weird it always felt using his legs, as he had never needed something so rudimentary to move around before, but that was just how the Lilim were created he supposed.  
卡罗尔稳稳地站在地上，评论着用双腿行走的感觉总是那么奇怪，他以前从未需要如此基础的方式来移动，但这就是莉莉姆的创造方式，他想。

Sitting down in front of the body of Lilith, he placed his hands behind him and said, "I'm waiting for you Shinji, so hurry up."  
他坐在莉莉丝的尸体前，双手撑在身后，说道：“我在等你，真嗣，快点过来。”

---

'The Black Moon of Lilith...huh?' thought Shinji as he reached the very depths of Terminal Dogma.  
“莉莉丝的黑月……吗？”真嗣一边想着，一边抵达了终端教条的最深处。

Shinji didn't know how, but as he reached the end of the long shaft where he had fought Unit 02, a large black hole opened up and seemed to have transported him. He had know idea if this was because he was inside an Evangelion, but he guessed that he was in the heart of the Black Moon. All around him was LCL fluid that seemed the stretched on for an eternity.  
真嗣不知道这是怎么发生的，但当他走到与二号机战斗过的长通道尽头时，一个巨大的黑洞突然出现，仿佛将他传送走了。他不清楚这是否因为他身处 EVA 之中，但他猜测自己已经来到了黑月的核心。四周全是 LCL 液体，似乎无边无际。

'I must be close now,' he thought.  
“我一定很接近了，”他心想。

He was still holding firmly onto Unit 02, as though his and its life was connected somehow, but now, he had to bid farewell to it, and Asuka's mother. He hoped that it would be recovered in due time...but as for now.  
他仍然紧紧抓着二号机，仿佛他与它的生命以某种方式相连，但现在，他不得不与它，以及明日香的母亲告别。他希望它能在适当的时候被找回……但就目前而言。

Gently laying it down in the LCL fluid, Shinji watched the red fluid wash around Unit 02's opens wounds for a minute until he turned and looked off in the distance. He could feel Kaoru's AT-field luring him onward...but the AT-field he had felt from earlier seemed to have disappeared. Well, whatever it was, it didn't seem like he'd have to deal with it right now.  
轻轻地将二号机放置在 LCL 溶液中，真嗣注视着红色液体在二号机的开放伤口周围流动了一分钟，直到他转身望向远方。他能感受到薰的 AT 力场在引诱他前进……但之前感受到的 AT 力场似乎已经消失了。好吧，无论那是什么，看起来他现在不必处理它。

Taking a few steps forward then, he suddenly heard static over the intercom and a very grabbled version of Misato's voice starting talking to him.  
他向前走了几步，突然间，对讲机里传来一阵静电噪音，接着是 Misato 断断续续的声音开始与他对话。

"Shinji...can...you...hear...me."  
“真嗣...你能...听到...我吗...”

"Misato? Yeah I can, but there's a lot of static."  
“Misato？嗯，我能听到，但是有很多杂音。”

"It seems...that the angels...AT-field...is interfering...somehow. But what is...happening down there?"  
"看来...天使的...AT 力场...不知怎地...在干扰...但下面...到底发生了什么？"

"Kaoru seemed to be controlling Unit 02 somehow."  
"Kaoru 似乎在某种程度上控制了二号机。"

"Are you...still pursuing him?"  
"你...还在追捕他吗？"

"Yeah...I am," replied Shinji rather glumly.  
“嗯...是的，”真嗣有些沮丧地回答道。

Misato, seeming to pick up the reluctance in his voice said, "Don't think about it...and just do what you think is right."  
美里似乎察觉到了他声音中的不情愿，说道：“别多想...就做你认为对的事。”

"I know...but..." mumbled Shinji.  
“我知道...但是...”真嗣咕哝着。

"What happened...to Unit 02?" asked Misato.  
"二号机...发生了什么？" 美里问道。

"Its..." said Shinji as he turned to see it laying in the LCL fluid. Sighing slightly he said, "Its not in the best shape."  
"它..." 真嗣说着转头看向躺在 LCL 溶液中的二号机。他轻叹一声，"它现在的状态不太好。"

"Well...we can pick it up...later. And Shinji?"  
"嗯...我们稍后再处理它...还有，真嗣？"

"Huh?" "啊？"

"Do you know...why the angel is...in Terminal Dogma, because I heard...what happened to Ritsuko."  
"你知道...为什么天使会在...中央教条区吗，因为我听说...发生了什么关于律子的事。"

"Was she confined?" asked Shinji.  
"她被关押了吗？" 真嗣问道。"

"Yes she was, so I assume...that it has something to do you. What exactly is...in Terminal Dogma that an angel...is searching for."  
"是的，所以我想...这和你有关。究竟是什么...在中央教条区，让天使...在寻找。"

"I'm sorry Misato, but I can't answer that right now. Ritsuko may tell you if you ask but-"  
"对不起，美里，我现在无法回答这个问题。如果你问理津子，她可能会告诉你，但是——"

"It would be impossible...right now. They have her locked up in a...holding cell for the time being. Thats why I needed to ask...you."  
"现在是不可能的...他们暂时把她关在一个...拘留室里。这就是为什么我需要问...你。"

Shaking his head, Shinji said, "As I said Misato, I can't answer that right now. Maybe later, but in truth, I don't know what may happen to me after this. So I can't make any promises."  
真嗣摇了摇头，说道：“正如我说的，美里，我现在无法回答这个问题。也许以后可以，但说实话，我不知道这之后我会怎样。所以我不能做出任何承诺。”

Silence over the voice intercom for a minute before Misato said, "Okay...I understand. Please be...careful."  
在通讯器中沉默了一分钟后，美里说道：“好吧……我明白了。请务必……小心。”

"Thank you Misato..." “谢谢你，美里……”

With that, Shinji cut the communication channel between them and continued walking forward towards Kaoru.  
说完，真嗣切断了与美里的通讯，继续向前走向薰。

Misato meanwhile slammed both palms of her hands onto one of the keyboards that littered the command center of Central Dogma. Beside her, Fuyutsuki watched in anticipation of what she may do next. Gendo had given him order that if Major Katsuragi were to start an investigation, then she was to be detained immediately, and while Fuyutsuki did not like the order, he did not have any choice but to follow it if need be.  
与此同时，美里将双手手掌猛地拍在中央教条指挥中心散布的键盘之一上。在她身旁，冬月观察着，期待她下一步的行动。碇源堂给了他命令，如果葛城美里少校开始调查，那么她必须立即被拘留。虽然冬月不喜欢这个命令，但如果必要，他没有选择，只能服从。

"We should just let Shinji see this through Major," said Fuyutsuki in a calm voice.  
“少校，我们应该让真嗣自己去面对这一切。”冬月平静地说道。

Misato threw him a dirty look before turning back to the monitor screen. She had no idea that Terminal Dogma reached that far under the Geofront. According to the computers, Shinji was well below the final levels, so where was he exactly. She knew Ritsuko had showed him something, something that apparently the commander was not too pleased with, but what was it?  
美里瞪了他一眼，然后转回监视屏幕。她完全不知道终端教条在地下都市的深处延伸到如此之远。根据电脑显示，真嗣已经深入到最底层以下，那么他究竟在哪里？她知道律子向他展示了某些东西，显然指挥官对此并不高兴，但那究竟是什么呢？

"Yes...I suppose there isn't anything else for us to do but wait," said Misato standing up straight.  
“是的……我想我们除了等待，别无他法，”美里站直了身子说道。

---

Shinji broke through the wall that he knew Kaoru was behind and waiting for him. LCL fluid poured out of the large gap from Lilith's chamber as Unit 01 walked in.  
真嗣突破了他知道薰在等待他的那堵墙。随着初号机走进莉莉丝的房间，LCL 液体从莉莉丝房间的大裂缝中涌出。

Though it was only Shinji's second time seeing the body of Lilith, he showed the least amount of interest towards this strange being, and instead, directed his full attention towards the person sitting in front of it.  
虽然这是真嗣第二次见到莉莉丝的身体，但他对这奇怪生物表现出最少的兴趣，而是将全部注意力转向坐在它面前的人。

"I see you made it Shinji-kun," said Kaoru with a wide smile across his face. Shinji however, chose to remain silent.  
"看来你来了，真嗣君，" 薰的脸上绽开了一个大大的笑容。然而，真嗣却选择保持沉默。

Standing up, Kaoru spread his arms outward as though he was preparing to hug somebody and said, "Don't be silent like that Shinji-kun."  
薰站起身来，张开双臂，仿佛准备拥抱某人，并说道："别这样沉默，真嗣君。"

"I don't think I have anything else to say to you," said Shinji.  
"我觉得我没什么别的话要对你说了，" 真嗣说道。

"Then will you kill me?"  
"那么你会杀了我吗？"

"I," Shinji hesitated, "I don't know."  
"我，" 真嗣犹豫了一下，"我不知道。"

Kaoru watched before a minute until he sighed and said, "The Lilim really are indecisive."  
薰观察了一会儿，直到他叹了口气说道："人类果然是优柔寡断。"

"Then is it so easy to kill someone for you!" yelled Shinji.  
"那么对你来说，杀一个人就这么容易吗！" 真嗣喊道。

"Of course," replied Kaoru, "it is as simple as moving my right arm."  
"当然，" 薰回答，"就像动动我的右臂一样简单。"

"That is not me." "那不是我。"

"Then you will not kill me?"  
"那么你不会杀我吗？"

"I don't know damn it!"  
"我不知道，该死！"

"Would it make any difference if I told you I wanted to die?"  
"如果我告诉你我想死，这会有什么不同吗？"

"Wha...Kaoru!" "什...Kaoru！"

"Would it make you feel better if you knew you were fulfilling my wish."  
"如果知道你在实现我的愿望，会不会让你感觉好些？"

"But its still killing." "但那仍然是杀戮。"

"But its not indiscriminate. It is something that I want you to do."  
"但并非随意而为。这是我想要你去做的事情。"

"You're not serious." "你不是认真的吧。"

"And if I am?" "如果我是呢？"

"Then I feel sorry for you," said Shinji.  
“那我为你感到遗憾，”真嗣说。

"Haha! Well said Shinji-kun. It seems that no matter what, your angel half will ultimately be kept in check by your purer human self."  
“哈哈！说得好，真嗣君。看来无论怎样，你的天使那一半最终都会被你更纯洁的人类自我所约束。”

"...What do you mean?" “……你是什么意思？”

"I mean precisely this. Even if your angel half completely takes you over, at heart, you will still remain a human. Given the circumstances, it is rather surprising that you are able to remain so after everything that has happened to you. You have a strong recognition of who you are. I don't think I have to worry about you anymore."  
"我的意思正是如此。即便你的天使部分完全占据了你，内心深处，你依然会保持人性。考虑到你所经历的一切，能保持到现在实在令人惊讶。你对自己的认知非常坚定。我想我不再需要为你担心了。"

"Meaning?" asked Shinji. "什么意思？" 真嗣问道。"

"Both Adam and Lilith want to use you, each of them have there own reasons of course. Myself...hmmm, you could almost say that I am following neither now. I simply want to see what choices you make."  
"亚当和莉莉丝都想利用你，他们各有各的理由。至于我...嗯，可以说我现在两边都不站。我只是想看看你会做出什么选择。"

"Why do you seem so interested in me?"  
"你为什么对我这么感兴趣？"

"Why? Maybe its because of the human body that I've become accustomed to. Maybe its because I lived with humans and got to know them better. Maybe its simply because of you. I don't really know to tell you the truth."  
"为什么？也许是因为我已经习惯了人类的身体。也许是因为我和人类一起生活，更了解他们。也许只是因为你。说实话，我也不太清楚。"

"I kinda understand why Lilith wants to use me...but why Adam? I mean...I'm human after all and-"  
"我有点明白为什么莉莉丝想利用我了...但为什么是亚当？我是说...毕竟我还是人类，而且-"

"Only part human," interrupted Kaoru. "Don't forget that you have angel DNA in you, and that is why he wants you, because you are at the same time angel and human."  
“只有部分是人，”薰打断道，“别忘了你体内有天使的 DNA，这就是他想要你的原因，因为你同时是天使和人类。”

"But why, and how did I even become this way?"  
“但为什么，我又是怎么变成这样的？”

Kaoru was silent, debating whether he should tell Shinji about his connection with Adam.  
薰沉默了，他在考虑是否应该告诉真嗣他与亚当的联系。

"I still don't know the answer to that," lied Kaoru.  
"我还是不知道那个问题的答案，" 薰撒谎道。

"Then why did you come here," asked Shinji.  
"那你为什么来这里，" 真嗣问道。

"To see Lilith of course," said Kaoru as he pointed behind himself  
"当然是来看莉莉丝的，" 薰说着指向自己身后

Shinji looked at the giant body of Lilith that Kaoru was pointing at and frowned.  
真嗣看着卡尔指向的莉莉丝那巨大的身躯，皱起了眉头。

"So what...you were just talking to it...and was it talking back?"  
“所以……你刚才只是在跟它说话……它也在回应你吗？”

"In a manner of speaking...yes," replied Kaoru with a slight smile.  
“可以这么说……是的，”卡尔微微一笑回答道。

Silence engulfed the chamber of Lilith for a minute before Shinji asked-  
沉默笼罩了莉莉丝的房间一分钟，随后真嗣问道——

"What will Seele do about this?"  
“Seele 会对此采取什么行动？”

Shrugging, Kaoru said, "Kill me first most likely, then attack this place. They still wants to become the gods of this world."  
耸了耸肩，薰说道：“多半会先杀了我，然后再攻击这个地方。他们仍然想成为这个世界的神。”

"And what of my father?"  
"那我父亲呢？"

"Gendo Ikari? Well, he wants to be reunited with his loved one."  
"碇源堂？嗯，他想与心爱的人重聚。"

"My mother?" "我母亲？"

"I did not say that, but essentially...yes."  
"我没那么说，但基本上...是的。"

Shinji hesitated for a second before he asked, "So then..."  
真嗣犹豫了一会儿，然后问道："那么..."

"I will die soon, either by your hand or not."  
"我很快就会死去，无论是死于你手还是其他。"

"But you still want to live."  
"但你仍然想活下去。"

"Everything being wants to live and is afraid of death, it is no different for me. Shinji-kun, I am an angel, something which is the enemy of all humanity; your enemy."  
"万物皆欲生存，惧怕死亡，我也不例外。真嗣君，我是天使，是全人类的敌人；你的敌人。"

"Then...you were serious before?"  
"那么...你之前是认真的吗？"

"If given the choice, I would prefer to die by your hand."  
"如果可以选择，我宁愿死在你的手中。"

"I won't kill you Kaoru!"  
"我不会杀你的，薰！"

Kaoru smiled then, but it wained as though he was in pain. Sighing, he said, "Then I'll just have to kill you instead Shinji-kun."  
薰那时笑了，但笑容很快消退，仿佛他正忍受着痛苦。叹了口气，他说道：“那么，我只好先杀了你，真嗣君。”

Half a second later, Kaoru AT-field erupted, slicing into Unit 01's chest cavity.  
半秒之后，薰的 AT 力场爆发，切入零号机的胸腔。

At the same time, a large slash appeared on Shinji's own chest, spilling blood into the entry plug and mixing with the LCL fluid.  
与此同时，真嗣自己的胸口也出现了一道巨大的伤口，鲜血涌入插入栓，与 LCL 液体混合在一起。

Lowering his right hand which he had raised upwards as he generated his own AT-field, Kaoru said, "Fighting you while your inside that Evangelion Unit is rather unfair though, so I think its better if we did this while facing each other. And besides, its time the Lilim learned how to live without the Evangelions."  
薰放下原本向上举起以生成自己 AT 力场的右手，说道：“在你驾驶着 EVA 的情况下与我战斗，实在有些不公平。我想，我们还是面对面较量更好。而且，人类也该学会在没有 EVA 的情况下生存了。”

At his very words, Unit 01 shuddered violently, and next second, the entry plug shot out behind Unit 01's head at the base of the neck. Teetering in place for a minute, Unit 01 fell backwards as it didn't have a pilot controlling it anymore, and with a loud splash, fell into the gallons of LCL fluid that floated around Lilith's chamber. The entry plug landed in the LCL fluid likewise, and within moments, washed upon the island thanks to the waves created by Unit 01's fall. Kaoru smiled widely as he walked towards the entry plug, but stopped as he felt Shinji's own AT-field ripping through the metal of the entry plug.  
听到他的话，初号机剧烈颤抖起来，下一秒，驾驶舱从初号机后颈底部弹射而出。初号机摇摇欲坠片刻后向后倒去，因为没有驾驶员操控，它重重地跌入漂浮在莉莉丝神殿中的大量 LCL 液体中。驾驶舱同样落入 LCL 液体，不久便随着初号机坠落引起的波浪冲到了小岛上。薰微笑着走向驾驶舱，却突然停下，因为他感觉到真嗣的 AT 力场正撕裂着驾驶舱的金属外壳。

A square chunk of metal popped off the entry plug, sending it flying across the small island and out stepped Shinji. From chest high, almost all the way to his feet, a large patch of red seemed to have been painted onto his plug suit. Of course this was his own blood, but it didn't seem that it was flowing anymore. Wincing slightly as he took a few steps away from Unit 01's entry plug, he looked up at Kaoru who stood before him.  
一块方形金属从驾驶舱上弹出，飞过小岛，随后真嗣走了出来。从胸口到脚踝，几乎整个下半身都被鲜红覆盖，仿佛涂上了一层红色颜料。当然，这是他自己的血，但似乎已经不再流动。他微微皱眉，从初号机的驾驶舱旁走了几步，抬头看向站在面前的薰。

Smiling slightly, Kaoru said, "It seems that you regenerated rather quickly, quicker than I had expected actually."  
薰微微一笑，说道：“看来你恢复得相当快，比我想象的还要快。”

Shinji winced slightly at Kaoru's words. It seemed that flesh wounds healed quickly, but his broken ribs that he had suffered earlier were still paining him.  
听到薰的话，真嗣微微皱眉。看来皮肉伤愈合得很快，但他之前受的肋骨骨折仍然让他感到疼痛。

"Kaoru...you..." wheezed Shinji.  
“薰...你...”真嗣喘息着说。

"Yes Shinji-kun?" asked Kaoru as he smiled back, simultaneously raising his right arm.  
“什么事，真嗣君？”薰微笑着回应，同时举起了他的右臂。

Shinji blinked several times, not believing what he was seeing. Opening his mouth in another attempt to persuade Kaoru to stop what he was doing, Shinji was cut off as Kaoru's arm came crashing down through the air. Shinji dove to his left just in time as Kaoru's AT-field ripped apart the stone flooring, spewing it up and into the air so that rubble rained down around Shinji. Effortlessly generating his own AT-field, Shinji split the larger pieces of debris, while blocking the small pieces.  
真嗣眨了几次眼，不敢相信自己所见。他张开嘴试图再次说服薰停止行动，却被薰挥下的手臂打断。真嗣及时向左一跃，薰的 AT 力场撕裂了石质地面，碎石四溅，如雨般落下。真嗣毫不费力地生成自己的 AT 力场，将较大的碎片劈开，同时阻挡了小碎片。

"Not bad Shinji-kun," said Kaoru as he continued smiling at him.  
“不错嘛，真嗣君。”薰继续微笑着对他说。

"Kaoru...why are you doing this!"  
“薰……你为什么要这么做！”

"I think the time for discussion is over with Shinji-kun, and besides, you said it yourself. 'I don't think I have anything else to say to you.'"  
“我想和真嗣讨论的时间已经结束了，而且，你自己也说过。‘我觉得我没什么别的话要对你说了。’”

Dashing forward, Kaoru swung his right arm in front of him, generating his AT-field and formed it into a large square. Still utterly confused at what was happening when a few moments ago it seemed as everything would be glossed over, Shinji continued sitting on the floor, watching the raw mass of energy soaring towards him.  
快步向前，薰挥动右臂，生成 AT 力场并将其塑造成一个巨大的正方形。仍然对刚刚发生的一切感到困惑，原本似乎一切都会被掩盖过去，真嗣继续坐在地板上，看着那股原始能量向他飞来。

'Did I really think that everything would turn out okay though?' he wondered. 'Was it ever possible for me and Kaoru to be anything other then enemies? I don't know...but I feel that at another place, and another time...we probably could have been frien-'  
“我真的以为一切都会好起来吗？”他疑惑着。“我和薰真的有可能不是敌人吗？我不知道……但我觉得在另一个地方，另一个时间……我们或许能成为朋友——”

Shinji's right fist ground against the stone flooring, splintering the knuckles and making blood flow out of the split skin.  
真嗣的右拳重重地砸在石地板上，指关节碎裂，鲜血从裂开的皮肤中流出。

"God Damn it Kaoru!" “该死的薰！”

Standing up promptly, he ignored his aching ribs and the new throb in his right hand, and quickly generated his own AT-field and formed it into the same square like shape as Kaoru's. Throwing it at Kaoru's AT-field, the two collided against each other with a sound like a cannon being fired directly into someones ear.  
他迅速站起身，不顾疼痛的肋骨和右手的新痛，迅速生成自己的 AT 力场，并将其塑造成与薰相同的方形。他将它投向薰的 AT 力场，两者相撞，发出如同炮弹直击耳膜般的巨响。

The air pressure exploded as the two AT-fields met, creating such a powerful gust of wind that Shinji thought that he was going to be blown backwards. The ripples that had finally subsided because of Unit 01's fall lit up again, as the LCL fluid crashed against the concrete walls of Lilith's chamber. Seismic waves shook the very foundations of Terminal Dogma, traveling up as far as the Geofront as well as parts of Tokyo-3. Inside the command center of Nerv, glasses, plant vases, and other assortment of breakable objects were in threat of falling over. Misato herself had to clutch onto a chair for support.  
两股 AT 力场相撞，气压瞬间爆炸，形成一股强劲的气流，让真嗣以为自己会被吹得倒退。由于初号机坠落而终于平息的涟漪再次亮起，LCL 液体猛烈地撞击着莉莉丝房间的混凝土墙。地震波撼动了终端教义的根基，一直传到地表前线乃至东京-3 的部分地区。在 NERV 的指挥中心内，玻璃杯、花瓶和其他易碎物品都面临着倾倒的危险。美里本人也不得不抓住椅子以保持平衡。

"What the hell is going on down there!" she shouted.  
“下面到底发生了什么鬼事！”她喊道。

For an answer, you would have had to have been there to believe it, for no telling of a story could have left quite the impact as watching these two people clash.  
要回答这个问题，你必须亲眼所见才能相信，因为任何叙述都无法像亲眼目睹这两人的冲突那样留下深刻印象。

Kaoru's AT-field was the stronger, and Shinji knew that, but he didn't care anymore. He simply wanted to punched Kaoru with everything he had, not caring about what the state of his own body looked at the end of it all.  
薰的 AT 力场更为强大，真嗣心知肚明，但他已不再在乎。他只想倾尽全力揍薰一顿，全然不顾自己最终会落得何种狼狈模样。

Orange sparks surged around the center of where the two AT-fields had met, as though two steel beams were being ground together. Shinji gritted his teeth so hard that he wore out the enamel on them as he tried pushing Kaoru's AT-field back at him...but to no avail.  
橙色的火花在两人的 AT 力场交汇处迸发，仿佛两根钢梁在相互碾磨。真嗣咬紧牙关，以至于牙釉质都磨损了，他试图将薰的 AT 力场推回去……但徒劳无功。

Moments later however, Kaoru's AT-field completely disappeared. Shinji, caught of balance unknowingly dissipated his own AT-field, leaving him to look across the strange battlefield at Kaoru who was standing there with his hands in his pockets.  
然而片刻之后，薰的 AT 力场完全消失了。真嗣在不知不觉中失去了平衡，也消散了自己的 AT 力场，他茫然地望向这片奇异的战场，只见薰双手插兜站在那里。

"Kaoru...lets just stop this! Why does one of us have to kill each other!" yelled Shinji.  
“薰……我们还是停手吧！为什么我们之中非要互相残杀不可！”真嗣大喊道。

Kaoru wasn't smiling anymore, and if anything, he seemed to be radiating a killing intent that Shinji had never felt before.  
薰不再微笑，相反，他似乎散发出一种真嗣从未感受过的杀意。

"I thought I told you Shinji-kun using your own words, that I have no intention of talking anymore."  
“我记得我告诉过你，真嗣君，用你自己的话来说，我无意再谈下去了。”

A cone like AT-field appeared in front of Kaoru similar to that of a drill. Pointing it directly at Shinji it charged at him as though Kaoru had thrown it like a javelin.  
一个形似钻头的 AT 力场出现在薰面前，宛如被他当作标枪投掷一般，直指真嗣冲去。

Shinji, seeing this clear act of hostility, and coupled with the killing intent he had felt from Kaoru moments before, lost all hope of ever stopping this battle.  
真嗣目睹这明显的敌意行为，加之之前从薰身上感受到的杀意，彻底失去了阻止这场战斗的希望。

'I guess he never intended it to be any other way,' thought Shinji as he generated an exact replica of Kaoru's AT-field.  
'我想他从一开始就没打算有别的结局，'真嗣想着，生成了一个与薰的 AT 力场完全相同的复制品。

Waiting a brief moment in hopes that Kaoru would stay his attack, Shinji shook his head then in resignation to what it was. Throwing his own AT-field at Kaoru's AT-field, he waited for the half second it would take for them to reach each other, and the ensuing explosion and attempt to block Kaoru's AT-field. In truth, he felt like the entire thing was hopeless. He could tell how much more powerful Kaoru was compared to him, but he had always known that.  
在短暂的等待中，希望薰能停止攻击，真嗣无奈地摇了摇头。他将自己的 AT 力场投向薰的 AT 力场，等待着那半秒钟，直到两者相撞，随之而来的爆炸和试图阻挡薰的 AT 力场。事实上，他觉得这一切都毫无希望。他能感觉到薰比他强大得多，但他一直都知道这一点。

Nothing of the sort happened.  
什么都没有发生。

Shinji blinked once, just as he saw Kaoru's cone like AT-field completely shattering as his own AT-field collided against. Standing motionless at what had just happened, he missed the brief instance were he could have corrected his AT-field.  
真嗣眨了一下眼，就在他看到薰的锥形 AT 力场完全破碎，与自己的 AT 力场相撞的那一刻。站在那里一动不动，他错过了可以修正自己 AT 力场的短暂瞬间。

Half a second later, Shinji blinked again, as his AT-field pierced Kaoru's chest cavity, exploding his innards out the back of his body in a red haze.  
半秒后，真嗣再次眨眼，他的 AT 力场穿透了薰的胸腔，将他的内脏炸裂，血雾从背后喷涌而出。

Two blinks from Shinji's eyes, and all this happened. Still standing motionless, he watched as Kaoru's body started falling backwards as bloody liquid fell out of the gaping hole that was almost five inches wide in diameter.  
真嗣眨了两下眼，这一切便发生了。他依旧一动不动地站着，看着薰的身体开始向后倒下，血水从近五英寸宽的巨大伤口中流出。

Taking one step forward, then two, then three and four, he was soon sprinting towards Kaoru's falling body.  
他向前迈出一步，接着是两步、三步、四步，很快便朝着薰倒下的身体疾奔而去。

"KAORU!" Shinji screamed with everything he had as Kaoru's body hit the stone cold floor.  
“薰！” 真嗣用尽全力嘶喊着，薰的身体重重地摔在冰冷的石地板上。

Skidding to a halt next to the battered body of Nagisa Kaoru, Shinji kneeled next to him in a pool of blood.  
真嗣急停在那遍体鳞伤的薰的身旁，跪在血泊中。

"Kaoru...why did you...what the hell did you!" shouted Shinji.  
“薰……你为什么……你到底做了什么！” 真嗣喊道。

Coughing up blood, Kaoru's normal smile couldn't help but resurface as he looked back at Shinji, "I knew that I couldn't physically kill you because of who I am...because of the soul of Adam that I house, so I had to make you think I was serious about killing you."  
咳血之际，看着真嗣，薰的嘴角不禁浮现出往常的微笑，“我知道，因为我的身份……因为我体内亚当的灵魂，我无法真正地杀死你。所以我必须让你以为我是认真的。”

"But why die anyway!" “但为什么要选择死亡呢！”

"Because it is better to die like this. Better to die by your hand then Seele's, or Lilith's."  
“因为这样死去更好。比起被 Seele 或莉莉丝所杀，死在你的手中更好。”

Shinji had no idea where Lilith fit in, but he didn't care at the moment.  
真嗣并不清楚莉莉丝的位置，但此刻他并不在意。

"Can't you just regenerate?" asked Shinji, "I'm able to...so shouldn't you be also."  
“你不能再生了吗？”真嗣问道，“我能做到……所以你也不应该可以吗。”

"You actually hit my core Shinji-kun," said Kaoru as he pointed towards a spot on his body. Shinji looked down at the gaping hole in Kaoru's chest and saw that he was pointed at where his heart was supposed to be. What lay there now looked like a pummeled piece of meet you would see at a grocery store. Shinji couldn't help but feel sick at this thought, as bile threatened to surge up his throat.  
“你真的击中了我的核心，真嗣君，”薰说着指向自己身体的一个部位。真嗣低头看着薰胸口的大洞，发现他指的是心脏所在的位置。那里现在看起来就像你在杂货店看到的被捣烂的肉块。真嗣不禁感到恶心，胃酸似乎要涌上喉咙。

"My core is my heart," said Kaoru. "Rather ironic that no matter how powerful humans get, they can still die so easily."  
"我的核心就是我的心，" 薰说。"颇具讽刺意味的是，无论人类变得多么强大，他们依然可以如此轻易地死去。"

"Isn't there anything I can-"  
"难道我什么都做不了吗-"

"I don't want you to even try. Its better this way as I said."  
"我不想让你尝试。正如我所说，这样更好。"

"But why? Why did you dissipate your AT-field at the last second!"  
"但为什么？为什么你在最后一刻散去了 AT 力场！"

"Shinji...you are gifted with visions are you not."  
"真嗣...你不是有预见能力吗。"

Shinji didn't see what this had to do with his question, but he nodded anyway.  
真嗣不明白这与他的问题有何关联，但还是点了点头。

"Like you, I also can see things...my own death for instance I saw. This...is something that have known for a long time, that I would die like this."  
"和你一样，我也能预见事物...比如我自己的死亡。这个...是我早已知晓的，我会这样死去。"

"And you didn't try to change it!"  
"而你却没有试图改变它！"

"I saw no reason that I should try."  
"我看不出有什么理由要去尝试。"

"You say that you don't follow Lilith and Adam, but in truth, you can't escape from them can you!" yelled Shinji.  
"你说你不追随莉莉丝和亚当，但实际上，你无法摆脱他们，对吧！" 真嗣喊道。

"No, I suppose it is the truth," replied Kaoru. "I am an angel, born from Adam, and no matter what, I have to follow his will, but because I house the soul of Adam, I have more freedom then the other angels. I am more free to think, but in the end I am still an angel. The reason I was able to see my own death is because of the soul of Adam...I was also able to see the deaths of my many sisters and brothers, but was not allowed to interfere with any of them."  
"不，我想这是事实，" 薰回答道。"我是一个天使，诞生自亚当，无论怎样，我都必须遵从他的意志，但由于我体内寄宿着亚当的灵魂，我比其他天使拥有更多的自由。我可以更自由地思考，但最终我仍然是一个天使。我能预见自己的死亡，是因为亚当的灵魂...我也能预见我众多兄弟姐妹的死亡，但不允许干涉其中任何一人的命运。"

"I don't understand you..."  
"我不明白你..."

"You are human...so you would not. Humans are grossly different from angels. They follow no one, not even Lilith, there creator. They shape their own futures with their hands, something the angels are incapable of doing. In a way, I think I felt envious of that. But such is the destiny of Adam and Lilith's children.  
"你是人类...所以你不会懂。人类与天使截然不同。他们不追随任何人，甚至不追随他们的创造者莉莉丝。他们用自己的双手塑造未来，这是天使无法做到的。某种程度上，我想我对此感到羡慕。但这就是亚当和莉莉丝后代的命运。

Kaoru paused here as he coughed up more blood.  
薰在这里停顿了一下，又咳出了更多的血。

"Shinji-kun...I have said it before many times, but you and I are alike. Even back when I first met you as your subconscious I felt that we were alike, but I found out that it is only a feeling that the soul of Adam gives me. In truth, you and I are nothing alike. More so, I should say that you and Adam are alike."  
"真嗣君...我曾多次说过，但你我相似。即使在我最初以你的潜意识身份遇见你时，我就感觉到我们相似，但我发现那只是亚当灵魂给我的感觉。事实上，你我并不相似。更确切地说，你和亚当相似。

Shinji blinked several times at the his strange statement.  
真嗣对他的奇怪言论眨了几次眼。

"Me and Adam alike? How? Isn't he a being that far surpasses us mere humans," said Shinji.  
“我和亚当一样？怎么可能？他不是远超我们这些凡人的存在吗？”真嗣说道。

"Yes but-" “是的，但是——”

Kaoru suddenly winced in pain as his right arm seemed to disintegrate on the spot. Shinji's eyes widened as he saw this, but Kaoru brushed it off as nothing saying, "This body is starting to decompose. Nobody called Nagisa Kaoru ever existed in the first place, so its only fitting that I should die in this way."  
突然间，真嗣的右臂仿佛当场解体，疼痛让他皱起了眉头。看到这一幕，渚薰的眼睛瞪大了，但真嗣却轻描淡写地说：“这具身体开始分解了。毕竟，从未有人记得过渚薰的存在，这样死去也不过是理所当然。”

Looking up at the body of Lilith towering over him, he frowned briefly as he thought, 'Can you see me now Lilith? Are you pleased with the way things turned out? The last of the angels is dying, so Seele only needs to be dealt with and then-'  
抬头望着高耸的莉莉丝之躯，他短暂地皱了皱眉，心中暗想：‘莉莉丝，你现在能看到我吗？你对这一切的结果满意吗？最后一位使徒即将消亡，接下来只需解决 Seele……’

Kaoru's left arm suddenly disappeared, as the particles of LCL fluid that created his body evaporated into the air.  
真嗣的左臂突然消失，构成他身体的 LCL 液体粒子蒸发到了空气中。

"Ahhh...this really sucks," he said, "dying does suck after all."  
"啊...这真是糟透了," 他说，"毕竟，死掉确实很糟糕。"

Blinking several times, he half expected tears to start to well up at the corners of his eyes, but of course no such thing happened.  
他眨了几次眼，半期待着泪水会在眼角涌出，但当然，这种事并没有发生。

"Kaoru...I," started Shinji.  
"薰...我，" 真嗣开口道。

"Don't apologize," sighed Kaoru, as both his legs started to disappear  
"别道歉了，" 薰叹息道，他的双腿开始逐渐消失。

Silence engulfed the two of them as time passed, though all the while, Kaoru continued disappearing.  
随着时间的流逝，寂静笼罩着两人，尽管如此，薰的身体仍在持续消失。

"Hey Shinji," said Kaoru after a few minutes had passed. All that was left was his neck and head now.  
"嘿，真嗣，" 几分钟后，薰说道。现在只剩下他的脖子和头部了。

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"Be careful about Lilith."  
"对莉莉丝要小心。"

"...Why?" "...为什么？"

"She is dangerous, and even I cannot fully understand what she means to accomplish."  
"她很危险，就连我也无法完全理解她的目的。"

"Is this Adam...or Kaoru?"  
"这是亚当...还是薰？"

"A little of both I suppose. I can understand some of it, but the soul of Adam shuts other parts out. Bit annoying really."  
"我想是两者都有吧。我能理解其中一部分，但亚当的灵魂把其他部分封闭了。真是有点烦人。"

"You know...you're starting to sound like a human."  
"你知道吗...你开始听起来像个人类了。"

"I am? ...Well, I guess thats what death will do to you."  
"我是吗？...嗯，我想这就是死亡会带给你的变化吧。"

Slowly his neck started to disappear.  
渐渐地，他的脖子开始消失了。

"Kaoru...you never finished what you said before about me and Adam being alike."  
“薰……你之前说我和亚当相似的话还没说完呢。”

"I didn't? No, I suppose I didn't," replied Kaoru. "It was something that I shouldn't have said in the first place.  
"“是吗？不，我想我是没说完，”薰回答道，“那原本就是我不该说出口的话。”

His neck disappeared. 他的脖子消失了。

"So...are you going to finish what you were saying earlier?"  
“那么...你打算继续说你之前没说完的话吗？”

"I suppose. You and Adam...huh? Even I still have a hard time believing it to be honest."  
“我想是的。你和亚当...嗯？说实话，即使是我也很难相信。”

"...What?" "...什么？"

His chin started to disappear.  
他的下巴开始消失。

"That you and Adam are connected in a way that seems almost impossible. A kind of connection that only a husband and wife could fully understand."  
“你和亚当之间的联系，似乎几乎是不可能的。一种只有夫妻才能完全理解的联系。”

"Husband...and wife?" “夫妻？”

"Your mother-" "你妈妈——"

His bottom lip started to disappear, making it increasingly difficult for him talk. Soon his entire mouth would be gone and he wouldn't be able to speak.  
他的下唇开始消失，这让他越来越难以说话。很快，他的整个嘴巴都会不见，他将无法再开口。

"My mother what!" shouted Shinji. "What about my mom!"  
"我妈妈怎么了！" 真嗣大喊。"我妈妈怎么了！"

The speed at which Kaoru was disappearing at suddenly seemed to increase, either due to it being the last part of his body that remained, or because of what he was telling Shinji. But Kaoru felt a slight shift in Adam's soul then, almost as though it didn't want Kaoru to speak those words.  
随着最后一部分身体的消失，或者是因为他告诉真嗣的事情，薰消失的速度突然加快了。但薰感觉到亚当的灵魂有了一丝微妙的变动，仿佛它不想让薰说出那些话。

"In truth...Adam is your-"  
“实际上……亚当是你的——”

Kaoru mumbled those incomprehensible words to Shinji, lost only to the ears of Shinji.  
薰对真嗣低语着那些只有真嗣能听懂的难以理解的话语。

Moments later, the fourth child, known as Nagisa Kaoru vanished from the world. But not before he whispered, "Cya Shinji-kun," to a boy long ago lost in his own thought.  
片刻之后，第四个孩子，被称为渚薰的，从这个世界上消失了。但在他消失之前，他对一个早已迷失在自己思绪中的男孩低语：“再见了，真嗣君。”

Shinji remained motionless long after the last angel disappeared, but eventually he did move...and when he did-  
在最后一个使徒消失后，真嗣久久地一动不动，但最终他还是动了……而当他动时——

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" “啊————————————！”

Shinji's AT-field erupted around him.  
真嗣的 AT 力场在他周围爆发。

---

Misato stood in front of the door she had locked Asuka in those many hours ago, which in truth felt like years ago.  
美里站在那扇门前，那扇她许多小时前将明日香锁在里面的门，实际上感觉像是多年前的事了。

She was hesitant on how she should proceed. She felt ashamed for what she had done to Asuka, and had even been tempted to have somebody else let her out, but knew that it had to be her. She had betrayed Asuka's trust, and she was probably the only person that Asuka would trust right now. Asuka didn't like other people to know what she was thinking, didn't want other people penetrating her armor, because underneath it all she was simply a confused and scared fifteen year old girl. Misato understood all this, so she had to correct what she had done, and right now, if Asuka were to ask her anything, she was afraid she might just tell.  
她犹豫着该如何进行。她为自己对明日香所做的事感到羞愧，甚至一度想让别人去放她出来，但知道必须由她自己来。她背叛了明日香的信任，而此刻明日香可能只信任她一个人。明日香不喜欢别人知道她的想法，不希望别人看穿她的伪装，因为在这一切之下，她只是一个困惑而害怕的十五岁少女。美里理解这一切，所以她必须纠正自己的错误，而且现在，如果明日香问她什么，她担心自己可能会如实回答。

Unlocking the door with a 'click' she grasped the door knob and turned it, throwing open the door and revealing the person inside the room.  
她用‘咔嚓’一声解锁了门，抓住门把手一转，猛地推开门，露出了房间里的人。

Asuka was laying on the hospital bed with her back propped against the wall and a pillow behind her back. Both her legs were drawn up to her chest, while her arms were wrapped around her legs. As she titled her head upwards away from her arms which her head had previously been buried in, Misato couldn't help but notice the lines on her face which suggested she had recently been crying. Misato felt even more ashamed for what she had done.  
明日香背靠着墙躺在病床上，背后垫着一个枕头。她的双腿蜷缩至胸前，双臂环绕着腿。当她将头从原本埋在的双臂中抬起时，美里不禁注意到她脸上的泪痕，显然她刚刚哭过。美里为自己所做的事感到更加羞愧。

Walking over to the bed, she sat down on the far corner of it and said, "Asuka...I'm sorry for what I did...and-"  
她走到床边，坐在床的远角，说道：“明日香...我为我所做的事道歉...而且-”

"I don't care," said Asuka bluntly and without emotion.  
"我不在乎," 明日香直截了当地说，毫无感情。

"You don't?" "你不在乎？"

"You obviously had something that you had to attend to and I couldn't be there for some reason."  
"你显然有事必须处理，而我有某种原因不能在场。"

Misato blinked a few times, surprised at how easy going Asuka was about the whole thing.  
美里眨了几次眼，对明日香对此事如此随和感到惊讶。

"Asuka...are you sure-" "明日香...你确定-"

"Yes, I'm perfectly fine," repeated Asuka now getting off the bed and throwing her arms above her head, stretching her stiff body. Turning around towards Misato, she said, "So are we done now?"  
"是的，我完全没问题，"明日香重复道，现在从床上下来，双臂高举过头，伸展她僵硬的身体。转身面向美里，她说："那我们现在结束了吗？"

Misato hesitated for a second, but didn't see any reason she should keep this from Asuka.  
美里犹豫了一瞬，但没觉得有什么理由该对明日香隐瞒。

"Not quite yet. I sent an evac team down into Terminal Dogma to retrieve Shinji, but it seems that the commander wanted a team supervised by himself sent down. I'm just waiting to find out...how Shinji is."  
“还没呢。我派了一支疏散小队进入最终教条区去接真嗣，但指挥官似乎想亲自监督一支队伍下去。我正在等消息……看看真嗣怎么样了。”

"What happened?" asked Asuka. "Earlier there was like...an earthquake or something."  
“发生了什么？”明日香问道，“之前好像……地震了还是怎么的。”

"I don't know for certain, but most likely what we felt was the clash of two very strong AT-fields."  
"我不确定，但很可能是我们感受到的两个非常强大的 AT 力场之间的冲突。"

"So...he's okay then?" asked Asuka after a few seconds pause.  
"那么...他没事吧？" 几秒钟后，明日香问道。

Misato guessed that she meant Shinji and nodded her head saying, "I don't know if he is perfectly fine, but I would like to hope so."  
美里猜测她指的是真嗣，点头说道："我不知道他是否完全没事，但我希望如此。"

"...I see," mumbled Asuka as she turned her head away from Misato and looked out the door that Misato hadn't bothered to close.  
“...我明白了，”明日香咕哝着，将头转向一边，不再看美里，目光投向美里未曾关上的门。

After a moments pause, Misato asked, "Would you like to see him...if possible, I mean?"  
片刻停顿后，美里问道：“你想见他吗...如果可能的话，我是说？”

Misato had expected Asuka to fly off the handle and start shouting obscenities, but Asuka's reaction was not something she had expected.  
美里本以为明日香会暴跳如雷，破口大骂，但明日香的反应却出乎她的意料。

Shifting her weight from one foot to the other, Asuka titled her head from side the side as she thought about the prospect of seeing that idiot.  
阿斯卡左右挪动着重心，头也跟着左右摇摆，思考着见到那个白痴的可能性。

"I don't...know," she finally said. "Maybe...why? Are you going to talk to him?"  
“我不……知道，”她终于开口，“也许……怎么了？你要去跟他谈吗？”

"I plan on it, yeah," replied Misato. "If you want to come..." Misato trailed off then. Was what she was proposing really a smart idea?  
“我打算这么做，是的，”美里回答，“如果你想来……”美里随后顿住了。她提议的这件事真的明智吗？

"Okay...I'll see the idiot..." mumbled Asuka as she looked down at her feet. My the hell was her heart beating as though she had just ran a mile?  
“好吧……我去见那个白痴……”明日香咕哝着，低头看着自己的脚。她的心跳得像刚跑完一英里似的，真是见鬼了。

"Great, we should get going then. The team should be returning with him shortly so we can just-"  
“太好了，那我们该出发了。队员们应该很快就会带他回来，这样我们就可以——”

Misato's cell phone rang.  
美里手机响了。

Looking at it rather apprehensively she pulled it off its clip where it hung on her pants. Looking at the number briefly, she flipped it open and said, "This is Major Katsuragi."  
她有些不安地看着它，从裤子上取下了夹子。瞥了一眼号码后，她翻开手机说道：“我是葛城美里少校。”

Asuka watched Misato listen to the person on the other line tell her several things, while all the while, Misato's face slowly became paler until it was the color of paper.  
明日香看着美里听着电话那头的人说了几件事，而美里的脸色逐渐变得苍白，直到如同纸张一般。

"What was that about," asked Asuka the second Misato had closed her cell phone.  
“那是什么事？”美里刚合上手机，明日香就问道。

Misato turned towards her, biting down on her lower lip in the process.  
美里转向她，过程中咬住了下唇。

"That was the vice-commander," she eventually said after a moments pause.  
“那是副司令，”她片刻后终于说道。

Asuka waited for Misato to tell her what the phone call was about, but when she didn't, Asuka took matters into her own hands.  
明日香等待美里告诉她电话的内容，但当她没有开口时，明日香决定自己采取行动。

"So what was the call about? Is something wrong?"  
"那通电话是关于什么的？出什么事了吗？"

Misato hesitated for a second before she said, "I don't know...but the team that was sent to retrieve Shinji hasn't been heard from and we can't contact them. The vice commander thinks that the angel might have killed them."  
美里犹豫了一下，然后说：“我不知道……但是派去接真嗣的小队失联了，我们联系不上他们。副司令认为可能是天使杀了他们。”

"The angel? But that would mean that-"  
"天使？但那岂不是意味着……"

"That Shinji may have lost...but I don't think so...I think Shinji may have...done something to them."  
"虽然真嗣可能输了...但我不这么认为...我觉得真嗣可能...对他们做了什么。"

"Like what?" asked Asuka.  
"比如什么？" 明日香问道。"

Misato simply continued staring at Asuka, but Asuka took that to mean-  
美里只是继续盯着明日香，但明日香从中理解为——

"He wouldn't...have killed them, would he?"  
"他不会...杀了他们吧？"

Shaking her head, Misato said, "I don't know. If he did...its because he learned something while in Terminal Dogma that drove him to killing. I don't believe that he could truly kill a human though."  
美里摇摇头说：“我不知道。如果他真的这么做了...那一定是因为他在最终教条区发现了什么，这让他走上了杀戮之路。但我并不认为他真的会去杀害人类。”

"He told me he had before," mumbled Asuka.  
“他告诉我他以前就这么做过，”明日香喃喃道。

Misato didn't know about the brief conversation Asuka and Shinji when they had first talked again after Asuka had lost her memories, so she was rather surprised that Asuka had known about that time.  
美里并不知道明日香和真嗣在明日香失忆后第一次交谈时的简短对话，所以她对明日香知道那段时间的情况感到相当惊讶。

"...He told you about that?"  
“……他跟你提过那件事？”

"It was more like he briefly mentioned it, but I didn't press him about it," said Asuka.  
“他只是顺带提了一下，但我没有追问，”明日香说道。

"Its something that he deeply regrets," muttered Misato.  
“这是他深感后悔的事，”美里喃喃道。

"So now what?" asked Asuka.  
“那现在怎么办？”明日香问道。

"I'm going back to the command center and you're coming with me. From there, we have the best chance of finding Shinji on any one of the security cameras in Nerv."  
“我要回指挥中心，你也跟我一起来。从那里，我们最有机会在 NERV 的任何一个监控摄像头中找到真嗣。”

"Okay," said Asuka as she nodded and followed Misato out the door.  
“好的，”明日香点头应道，跟着美里走出了门。

However, in truth, what Asuka had said earlier about being fine was a lie. She did care, and was still hurt by what Misato had said and done. Everybody continued lying to her, and even now, she wasn't sure if what Misato had said was entirely truthful. From what she had gleaned at Misato's surprised expression when she had told Misato about Shinji briefly mentioning he had killed someone, she could tell that Misato knew what circumstances had led up to him killing whoever it was. But Asuka didn't tell Misato about any of this, because she didn't want to be lied to again, so she kept these bottled up feelings inside of her. And yet-  
然而，实际上，明日香之前说自己没事的话完全是谎言。她确实在意，美里所说所做仍让她心痛。每个人都继续对她撒谎，甚至现在，她也不确定美里的话是否完全真实。从美里听到她提及真嗣曾短暂提到自己杀过人时露出的惊讶表情，她能看出美里知道导致真嗣杀人的具体情况。但明日香没有向美里透露这些，因为她不想再次被欺骗，所以她将这些压抑的情感深藏心底。然而——

'Why is it, that whenever _he_ lies to me, it hurts worst of all?' thought Asuka.  
“为什么每次他对我撒谎，都比任何时候更让我心痛？”明日香暗自思忖。

She didn't know...but she intended to find out.  
她不知道...但她打算弄清楚。

---

A door opened and Shinji stepped in.  
门开了，真嗣走了进来。

The door in question led into the commanders office...Gendo Ikari's.  
那扇门通向指挥官的办公室...碇源堂的。

Gendo stood behind his desk and looked out of the window directly behind his desk. The entirety of the Geofront was revealed before him.  
源堂站在办公桌后，透过窗户直视前方。整个 Geofront 的全貌展现在他眼前。

As Shinji started walking forward, his footsteps echoed off the walls. It seemed that they were the only two people in the office.  
当真嗣开始向前走时，他的脚步声在墙壁间回响。似乎办公室里只有他们两个人。

"Is that you Shinji?" asked Gendo when Shinji's foot steps came to a halt.  
“是你吗，真嗣？”当真嗣的脚步声停下时，源堂问道。

"Yeah, it is," whispered Shinji.  
"是啊，确实如此。" 真嗣低声说道。

Gendo turned around to see Shinji standing in front of his desk with his hands at his side.  
源渡转过身来，看到真嗣站在他的办公桌前，双手垂在身侧。

"Why have you come here?"  
"你为什么来这里？"

"You should already know that...father..." mumbled Shinji.  
"你应该已经知道了...父亲..." 真嗣咕哝道。

Gendo gazed at him for a moment before he asked, "What did the angel tell you?"  
碇源堂凝视了他片刻，然后问道：“天使告诉了你什么？”

"Enough to know that you've been lying to me all this time!" yelled Shinji, slamming his fist on the wooden desk, denting it. His eyes still glowed blood red.  
“足够让我知道你一直在对我撒谎！”真嗣吼道，一拳砸在木桌上，砸出了凹痕。他的眼睛依然闪烁着血红色的光芒。

Gendo who hadn't even flinched looked Shinji in the eye and asked, "What does it really change?"  
从未动摇的源堂直视着真嗣的眼睛，问道：“这究竟能改变什么？”

"It changes everything damn it!" shouted Shinji. "And you knew about it the entire fucking time!"  
“它改变了一切，该死的！”真嗣吼道，“而你他妈的一直都知道！”

"If you want to blame somebody, blame your mother."  
“如果你想怪罪谁，就怪你母亲吧。”

"Don't you dare drag her name into this you bastard! She was...she was..."  
"你敢把她牵扯进来，你这个混蛋！她曾经...她曾经..."

Shinji just didn't know anymore. Why did his mother do such a thing?  
真嗣只是不知道了。为什么他的母亲会做出这样的事？

"Are you going to cooperate with me? Or do I have to confine you for the time being?"  
"你是要和我合作吗？还是我暂时得把你关起来？"

"As if you could confine me if you tried. I already dealt with the people you sent to capture me. I assume that you expected something like this ahead of time so you had people ready when-"  
“仿佛你真能困住我似的。你派来抓我的人，我已经解决了。我猜你事先预料到了这种情况，所以才安排了人手准备——”

Shinji sensed movement behind him and turned as two armed guards with submachine guns stepped into the office with there guns pointed towards him. Without even so much as a passing glance at them, he swung his right arm down, slicing the barrels off both guns. Simultaneously the guards pulled the trigger, but the bullets exploded as they reached the sliced of gun barrel, shattering the guns instantly. The guards stood there in surprise at the boy across the room from them who's blood red eyes seemed to pierce through them.  
真嗣察觉到身后有动静，转身只见两名持冲锋枪的警卫步入办公室，枪口直指着他。他毫不犹豫地挥下右臂，将两支枪的枪管齐齐切断。警卫们同时扣动扳机，但子弹在触及被切断的枪管时爆炸，瞬间将枪支粉碎。警卫们惊愕地站在原地，望着房间对面那个少年，他血红色的眼睛仿佛能穿透他们。

As Shinji looked back at Gendo though, it seemed that he was legitimately surprised at the current situation.  
然而，当真嗣回头看向源堂时，似乎他真的对当前的局势感到意外。

"So your angel self has fully awakened it seems, but you still retain your human mind."  
"看来你的天使自我已经完全觉醒了，但你仍然保留着人类的意识。"

"I think I can thank Kaoru for that," said Shinji.  
"我想我得感谢薰，" 真嗣说道。"

"I see," said Gendo as he placed his hands together.  
"我明白了，" 源堂说着，将双手合十。"

Shinji watched as he slowly removed the glove on his right hand. As Shinji saw the disfigured hand that was underneath the glove, his face showed nothing but disgust.  
真嗣看着他缓缓摘下右手的手套。当真嗣看到手套下那只畸形的手时，他的脸上除了厌恶别无他物。

As Gendo flexed his right hand, Shinji asked, "Is that the effect of having my DNA transplanted into you?"  
当源渡活动他的右手时，真嗣问道：“那是将我的 DNA 移植到你身上的效果吗？”

Gendo smiled slightly as he replied, "Dr. Akagi didn't leave anything out did she. So am I assuming she also told you about Rei and the dummy plugs."  
源渡微微一笑，回答道：“赤木博士没有遗漏任何细节，对吧。那么我猜她也告诉你关于绫波和傀儡系统的事了。”

Shinji's scowl was all the answer he needed.  
真嗣的皱眉已经给了他所需的全部答案。

"Then that saves me the trouble of questioning her at least."  
“那至少省了我审问她的麻烦。”

"What I don't understand is why though...why my DNA?" asked Shinji.  
“我不明白的是为什么……为什么要用我的 DNA？”真嗣问道。

"I'm surprised you haven't been able to figure that one out yourself...after all, how else was I supposed to get Adam's DNA...your true father."  
"我真惊讶你自己还没能想明白这一点...毕竟，我还能怎么得到亚当的 DNA...你真正的父亲。"

At these words, Shinji lost control of himself and the willpower it was taking him to not strike the man in front of him. Charging forward, he brought back his right hand intending to hit Gendo, but instead, his fist collided against something that felt like a solid wall.  
听到这些话，真嗣失去了自我控制，他努力克制自己不去攻击面前这个男人。他冲上前去，举起右手想要打在源堂身上，但他的拳头却撞上了一堵坚实的墙。

'What the hell?' he thought.  
'这他妈是什么鬼？' 他心想。

A flicker of orange. 一抹橙色闪过。

"I was rather surprised when I could do this also," said Gendo as he brandished his right arm, as though showing off his newly created AT-field.  
"我能够做到这一点，也颇感意外，" 碇源堂说着，挥舞着他的右臂，仿佛在炫耀他新创造的 AT 力场。

"You can...create a visible AT-field?"  
"你能...创造一个可见的 AT 力场？"

"Yes, but it isn't on par with yours. My body is constantly rejected that DNA of yours that I injected myself with. Eventually, this body will be destroyed because of the strain that is being put on it, but by then, it wont really matter."  
"是的，但我的身体无法与你相比。我注射的你的 DNA 一直在被排斥。最终，这个身体会因为承受的压力而崩溃，但到那时，一切都不重要了。"

"You bastar-" "你这个混蛋-"

Gendo's AT-field smashed against the top of Shinji's head knocking him out immediately.  
碇源堂的 AT 力场猛击在真嗣的头顶，立即将他击晕。

"Put him in a holding cell," said Gendo gesturing towards the two guards as he turned away from the unconscious Shinji laying on the floor. "And give it maximum security. I don't want him breaking out."  
"把他关进拘留室，" 源渡一边说，一边向两名警卫示意，同时转身离开躺在地板上不省人事的真嗣。"并且要最高级别的安保。我不希望他逃出来。"

The guard hesitated for a second, knowing that what he had witnessed here today was not something to be spoken openly...and yet...  
警卫犹豫了一秒钟，他知道今天在这里目睹的一切不是可以公开谈论的事情...然而...

"Understood sir," the guard said as he hoisted Shinji onto his shoulders. He couldn't understand half of what had been said, but he knew that this kid was in deep shit.  
"明白，长官，" 警卫说着将真嗣扛到肩上。他虽然不太明白刚才所说的一半内容，但他知道这孩子陷入了大麻烦。

As the guards passed out of the room, Gendo put the white glove back on his hand as cold sweat passed down his face. He wouldn't be able to use his AT-field many more times, since it eroded his body all the more quickly. But even so...  
当卫兵们离开房间时，碇源堂重新戴上白色手套，冷汗顺着他的脸颊滑落。他不能再多次使用 AT 力场了，因为它加速侵蚀着他的身体。但即便如此...

'Only Seele has the power to stop me, and even now it is becoming to late. I hold all the cards,' thought Gendo.  
'只有 Seele 能阻止我，而现在，时机已逐渐变得太晚。我掌握着所有的牌，'碇源堂心想。

Not once did he take into account what Lilith had planned.  
他从未考虑过莉莉丝的计划。

"What did you say!" shouted Misato into the receiver of her phone.  
“你说什么！” 美里对着电话的听筒大喊道。

"I'm sorry it took me so long to report it," said the guard who had taken Shinji away from Gendo's office hours ago.  
“很抱歉这么久才汇报，” 那位几小时前将真嗣从源堂办公室带走的警卫说道。

"What do you mean he broke into the commanders office!" shouted Misato again. Beside her, Asuka was stock-still with her eyes wide, not believing what she was hearing.  
“你说他闯进了指挥官的办公室！” 美里再次大喊。在她身旁，明日香瞪大了眼睛，一动不动，不敢相信自己所听到的。

"Just what I said. The commander gave us orders to wait outside his office and if we saw the third child enter, then we were to wait five minutes before entering it ourselves."  
“正如我所说，指挥官命令我们在他办公室外等候，如果我们看到第三个孩子进入，那么我们就要等五分钟后才进去。”

"I don't care about that part. What they talked about! Repeat what they talked about damn it!"  
“我不在乎那部分。他们谈论了什么！重复他们谈论的内容，该死的！”

"Well, I didn't understand a lot of it. There was talk about the AT-field thing, which I sorta understood, but then the commander seemed to create one, and everything just became confusing afterwar-"  
“嗯，我很多都没听懂。他们提到了 AT 力场，这部分我有点理解，但随后指挥官似乎创造了一个，之后的一切就变得混乱了——”

"Tell me again! What did the commander say about Adam!"  
“再说一遍！指挥官对亚当说了什么！”

The guard paused here for a minute before he replied, "Something about Adam being the third child's father, which didn't make much sense to me but-"  
卫兵在这里停顿了一会儿，然后回答道：“指挥官提到亚当是第三个孩子的父亲，这对我来说没什么意义，但是——”

Misato ended the call here, gaining the knowledge that she had needed. Biting on her finger nails, she ran over what she had just heard. 'The commander has an AT-field? Shinji is Adam's son? It doesn't make any God damn sense!'  
美里在这里结束了通话，获得了她需要的信息。她咬着指甲，反复思考刚刚听到的话。‘指挥官有 AT 力场？真嗣是亚当的儿子？这他妈的一点道理都没有！’

"Umm...Misato, is anything wrong?" asked Asuka hesitantly.  
“嗯……美里，有什么不对劲吗？”明日香犹豫地问道。

Misato had momentarily forgotten about Asuka. Turning towards her, she realized how much danger she was suddenly in. If the commander somehow found out that she knew this information a cell with her name on it would be prepared. And then there was the matter of Asuka. Should she tell Asuka about it? It didn't seem like a good idea but what choice did she have. Both Shinji and Ritsuko were confined and she couldn't trust Fuyutsuki because of his connection with the commander. But if she was in trouble, then Asuka would certainly be also. The commander couldn't have failed to notice the bond that Shinji and Asuka had shared, and even though Asuka couldn't remember those times, and Shinji didn't feel anything for her anymore, he could still use Asuka as leverage.  
美里一时忘记了明日香的存在。转向她，她意识到自己突然陷入了多大的危险。如果指挥官发现她知道这些信息，一间写有她名字的牢房就会准备好。然后还有明日香的问题。她应该告诉明日香吗？这似乎不是个好主意，但她还有什么选择。真嗣和律子都被关押了，她不能信任副司令，因为他与指挥官有联系。但如果她陷入麻烦，那么明日香肯定也会。指挥官不可能没有注意到真嗣和明日香之间的羁绊，尽管明日香不记得那些时光，真嗣也不再对她有任何感觉，他仍可能利用明日香作为筹码。

Biting down on her lips, she grabbed Asuka's hand and dragged her towards the elevators so they could get away from the exquisite ears of the other personnel in the command center.  
咬紧嘴唇，她抓住明日香的手，拖着她走向电梯，以便远离指挥中心其他人员的敏锐耳朵。

"Misato...what are you?" asked Asuka.  
“美里...你到底是什么？”明日香问道。

"Keep quiet...I'll tell you in a minute once the others can't here us."  
“别出声...等其他人听不到我们说话时，我会告诉你的。”

Dragging Asuka into the elevator with her, she punched the button that would take them to the tram station so they could make there way back to where the car was parked. Misato wasn't taking any chances about being held up here. She had failed Shinji and Asuka too many times before, but she wasn't about to let that continue.  
美里拽着明日香进了电梯，按下了通往电车站的按钮，以便他们能返回停车的地方。美里不想再有任何耽搁。她之前已经让真嗣和明日香失望太多次了，但她绝不允许这种情况继续下去。

As the elevator doors closed, Asuka shook off Misato's grip and backed away from her.  
电梯门关闭时，明日香挣脱了美里抓住她的手，向后退去。

"Misato whats going damn it! That phone call earlier and-"  
"美里，到底怎么回事啊！之前的电话还有——"

"Hang on Asuka," replied Misato.  
"等等，明日香，"美里回答道。

Sweeping the elevator with her eyes, she didn't see any cameras, but could only hope that there weren't any listening devices.  
她用目光扫视着电梯内部，没有发现任何摄像头，只能暗自祈祷没有窃听器。

"Okay...Asuka, what I'm about to tell you can not leave this elevator, nor can we talk about it ever again.  
“好吧……明日香，我要告诉你的事情绝不能离开这个电梯，我们也不能再提起它。”

"Misato, I've never seen you like this before. What happ-"  
“美里，我从没见过你这样。发生了什么——”

"Asuka, your word!" "明日香，听你的！"

Asuka opened her mouth in anger, but closed it when she saw the serious look on Misato's face. Seriously...what could make Misato change this much in such a short time...unless it had something to do with that idio-  
明日香愤怒地张开嘴，但看到美里严肃的表情时又闭上了。说真的...是什么能让美里在这么短的时间内改变这么多...除非这与那个白痴有关——

"Fine, I won't say a word."  
"好吧，我一个字也不说。"

"Thank you," said Misato.  
“谢谢你，”美里说道。

Not even two minutes later, Asuka felt as though all the air had been sucked out of the elevator, as Misato told Asuka what she had heard from the guard.  
不到两分钟，明日香就觉得电梯里的空气仿佛被抽空了一样，因为美里告诉了她从警卫那里听到的消息。

---

Shinji opened his eyes groggily in his cell, and for a moment forgot where he was. But as the confrontation with somebody who he had for fifteen years thought was his father came crashing back to him, he sighed and rolled over onto his side.  
真嗣在他的牢房里昏昏沉沉地睁开眼睛，有那么一会儿忘记了身在何处。但当与那个他十五年来一直认为是自己父亲的人对峙的情景再次涌上心头时，他叹了口气，翻身侧躺。

The room he was in was completely black and didn't seem to even have a toilet in it. His hands were cuffed behind his back, but did they really think that would stop him. Breaking the cuffs easily with his AT-field, he stood up and walked over to what he guessed was a door.  
他所在的房间一片漆黑，似乎连个厕所都没有。双手被反铐在背后，但他们真以为这能阻止他吗？他轻易地用 AT 力场挣脱了手铐，站起身来，走向他猜测是门的地方。

Now that he was fully awakened as an angel, he could feel everybody's AT-field no matter how small.  
如今他已完全觉醒为天使，能感受到每个人的 AT 力场，无论多么微弱。

"Seems as though they posted guards outside my door," whispered Shinji as he sensed two people with automatic weapons stationed just on either side of the door. He could easily break out and escape, but what would be the point really. And right now, he knew that it wasn't just himself, but also Asuka and Misato that were in trouble, so right now, he elected to do nothing.  
“看来他们在门外布置了守卫。”真嗣低声说道，他感觉到门口两侧各有一名手持自动武器的人。他本可以轻易逃脱，但这样做又有什么意义呢。而且他知道，现在不仅仅是他自己，还有明日香和美里都陷入了困境，因此他决定暂时按兵不动。

'That bastard still needs me, otherwise he wouldn't have kept me alive,' thought Shinji. He from now on would refer to Gendo as 'that bastard.'  
“那个混蛋还需要我，否则他不会留我活命。”真嗣心想。从今往后，他将把碇源堂称为“那个混蛋”。

Sitting back down on the cold floor, he rolled over onto his side and thought briefly how he had felt when Kaoru had told him that his father was not Gendo Ikari, but rather Adam. He was shocked of course, so that was probably why he wasn't able to control himself very well. The team sent to retrieve him didn't seem to have any life threatening injuries at least, but Shinji still hated himself for what he had done.  
他重新坐回冰冷的地板上，侧身躺下，短暂地回忆起当薰告诉他，他的父亲不是碇源堂，而是亚当时的感受。他当然震惊了，这或许就是他当时无法很好控制自己的原因。前去接他的小队至少没有受到致命伤，但真嗣仍然为自己所做的一切感到自责。

He wasn't sure how he felt, and even felt more confused about his mother. Had she known about Adam? Almost certainly, she was involved with the original contact experiment after all. But for some reason, deep down, he had almost expected something like this. It certainly explained everything about him. And he thought how he would have reacted earlier, if he had known about this. He would have reacted differently, and probably been consumed by hatred, leading him down a different path with different choices.  
他不确定自己的感受，甚至对母亲更加困惑。她是否知道亚当的存在？几乎可以肯定，毕竟她参与了最初的接触实验。但不知为何，内心深处，他几乎预料到了这样的事情。这无疑解释了他的一切。他思考着，如果早些知道这些，他会如何反应。他会有不同的反应，可能会被仇恨吞噬，走上一条充满不同选择的道路。

'I am the child of a human and a...well, whatever Adam is I suppose. What does that make me? I'm neither human...nor really an angel.'  
'我是人类和...嗯，不管亚当是什么，我猜我是他们的孩子。那我算什么？我既不是人类...也不完全是天使。'

'Does it matter?' asked a voice in his head that sounded oddly like Asuka. 'You are who are...Shinji Ikari, nobody else.'  
'这重要吗？'他脑海中响起一个声音，听起来出奇地像明日香。'你就是你自己...碇真嗣，没有别人。'

"You're right," voiced Shinji openly into the empty room.  
“你说得对，”真嗣对着空荡荡的房间坦然说道。

Placing his hands behind his head, he closed his eyes and thought, 'I may as well try to sleep for a while. God knows that they'll be running more tests on me then normal now.'  
他将双手枕在脑后，闭上眼睛想道：‘我还是试着睡一会儿吧。天知道他们现在会对我进行比平时更多的测试。’

Rolling over onto his other side, Shinji quickly fell into a deep sleep that he had not felt since he had left Misato's apartment.  
真嗣翻身转向另一侧，很快便陷入了自离开美里公寓以来未曾有过的深沉睡眠。

---

SOOOOOO...DID ANYBODY SEE THAT COMING?  
所以……有人预料到会发生这种事吗？

### Chapter 27: Calm

**I've been busy so this took longer then I intended. Anyways, after everything that came out in the last few chapters, I got back to the basics of ShinjiXAsuka, though its not very...endearing.  
我最近很忙，所以这章比预期花的时间长。总之，在经历了前几章的种种风波后，我回归了真嗣和明日香的基本故事线，虽然这并不怎么……令人心动。**

---

Asuka didn't know what to think anymore.  
明日香已经不知道该怎么想了。

Back in Misato's apartment, she lay on her bed with one arm draped over her forehead. The moment they had gotten home, Misato had immediately drunken five cans of beers, and promptly passed out on the kitchen floor. Asuka didn't even want to think what the kitchen would smell like in the morning when she woke up, that is, if she would ever fall asleep.  
回到美里小姐的公寓，她躺在床上，一只手臂搭在额头上。一回到家，美里立刻灌下了五罐啤酒，随即在厨房地板上昏睡过去。明日香甚至不愿去想明天早上醒来时厨房会是什么味道，如果她能睡着的话。

It was currently half past midnight, and with no sign of sleep coming to her any time soon, Asuka sat up on the edge of the bed, and grabbed a small case on her bedside table. Opening it slowly, she looked at the two earrings set inside the soft velvet. She wasn't sure why, but she was afraid that they would disappear one day if she didn't constantly look at them. Maybe that was a desire to know where she had gotten them from though. Closing the lid, she let out a soft sigh through half closed lips, set the case back on the table, and flopped back down on her futon. Rolling over onto her stomach, she punched her pillow in anger.  
现在已是午夜半点，由于丝毫没有睡意，明日香坐在床边，从床头柜上拿起一个小盒子。她缓缓打开它，凝视着里面柔软天鹅绒上摆放的两只耳环。她不确定为什么，但她害怕有一天它们会消失，如果不经常看着它们的话。也许那是一种想要知道它们从何而来的渴望。合上盖子，她半闭着嘴唇轻轻叹了口气，将盒子放回桌上，然后又倒回被褥中。翻身趴下，她愤怒地捶打枕头。

She kept thinking about everything Misato had told her in the elevator, which really hadn't been much. Misato had told her what she had heard on the phone, about the commander having an AT-field and Shinji's father not being the commander, but in actuality Adam. Then Misato had said something along the lines of-  
她一直在回想电梯里美里告诉她的那些话，其实并不多。美里告诉她从电话里听到的，关于指挥官拥有 AT 力场以及真嗣的父亲并非指挥官，而是亚当。然后美里说了类似这样的话——

"Asuka, when we get out of the elevator, I want you to stick close to me and don't talk to anybody, even you recognize them."  
“明日香，当我们走出电梯时，我希望你紧跟着我，不要和任何人说话，即使你认识他们。”

Asuka had asked, "Why?" but Misato only said.  
明日香问：“为什么？”但美里只是说。

"Its better if we get back to my apartment for the time being."  
“暂时回我公寓比较好。”

Asuka had looked at Misato's face then, and saw something she never expected to see before.  
那一刻，明日香看着美里，看到了她从未预料到的表情。

Fear.

Misato was fearful about what would happen if it was found out that she knew about these things. Asuka knew that now after thinking about it for some hours. So now she was in the same boat, having to worry about being called in for questioning. Asuka honestly thought that Misato was overreacting a great deal. Sure, she was rather startled when she heard everything, but she didn't think that they would be sent to prison or something just for knowing those things.  
美里害怕如果被发现她知道这些事情会发生什么。经过几个小时的思考，明日香现在明白了。所以她现在处境相同，不得不担心被传唤问话。明日香真心觉得美里反应过度了。当然，当她听到一切时确实很震惊，但她不认为仅仅因为知道这些事情就会被送进监狱。

And yet, she couldn't fall asleep.  
然而，她就是无法入睡。

'I'm not worried in the slightest, so why the hell can't I fall asleep?' she wondered.  
'我一点也不担心，可为什么我就是睡不着呢？'她纳闷着。

'You're not worried about _yourself_,' whispered a small voice in her head, 'but thats not to say you aren't worried about _somebody_.'  
'你不是担心自己，'一个微小的声音在她脑海中低语，'但这并不意味着你不担心某个人。'

'Thats stupid,' replied at once Asuka, 'why the hell would I be worried about that idiot?'  
'那太蠢了，' 明日香立刻反驳道，'我为什么要担心那个白痴？'

'...I never said anything about him.'  
'……我从没提过他。'

Even though it was technically herself that she was talking to, her face still managed to turn a faint shade of pink.  
尽管实际上是在和自己对话，她的脸颊还是不由自主地泛起了一抹淡淡的粉红色。

'Ridiculous...thats-' '荒谬...这简直是-'

'Precisely true,' said the voice.  
'完全正确，'那个声音说道。

Asuka immediately sat bolt upright, banishing the annoying voice in the process. Shaking her head, her hair whipped around her face, making it more messy then it already was.  
明日香立刻笔直地坐了起来，顺便赶走了那个烦人的声音。她摇了摇头，头发在她脸上甩来甩去，比之前更加凌乱了。

"Damn it," she groaned as she stood up and walked towards her door. "I need some air."  
"该死，"她咕哝着站起身，朝门口走去。"我需要透透气。"

Sliding the door open, she glanced towards the kitchen. The only thing she could see of Misato was her feet; the rest of her body was concealed by the kitchen counters.  
她拉开房门，瞥向厨房。唯一能看到的是美里塔的脚；她的身体被厨房的柜台遮挡住了。

Failing to conceal the looked of disgust that passed over her face at Misato demeanor, she turned away from this sight and walked towards the front door. Unfortunately, this apartment didn't have a balcony or veranda of any sorts, so if somebody wanted air, they had to go out the front door and stand on the cement walkway in front of the apartment. At least it had a metal railing that you could lean against though.  
她没能掩饰住脸上掠过的厌恶表情，对美里塔的举止感到反感，于是转身离开这景象，走向前门。不幸的是，这个公寓没有阳台或任何形式的露台，所以如果有人想要呼吸新鲜空气，他们必须走出前门，站在公寓前的人行道上。至少那里有一道金属栏杆可以靠一靠。

Misato's apartment was five levels above the ground floor, so when Asuka went outside and leaned over the railing, it was a good five stories down to the bottom.  
美里小姐的公寓位于地面五层之上，所以当明日香走出去并倚靠在栏杆上时，下面足有五层楼的高度。

Throwing her arms over the railing, she pressed her full weight against it, putting her faith in it that it wouldn't break, and breathed in a lungful of air. Letting it out in one deep breath, she looked up at the night sky.  
她将双臂搭在栏杆上，全身重量都压了上去，全然信任栏杆不会断裂，深深吸了一口气。然后缓缓呼出，抬头仰望夜空。

'Don't know what I expected,' she thought as she looked up at the black sky. The stars of course were impossible to see because of the bright lights of Tokyo-3.  
“不知道我在期待什么，”她望着漆黑的天空心想。当然，东京-3 的明亮灯光使得星星完全看不见。

Turning around now, she pressed her back against the railing, placing both arms on either sides of the railing and titled her head upward. If she leaned back too far, she would fall head over heels and go crashing to the bottom, but that wasn't something she was really thinking.  
她转过身来，背靠在栏杆上，双臂分别搭在栏杆两侧，头微微仰起。如果她向后仰得太远，就会一头栽下去，摔到底部，但这并不是她此刻真正在考虑的事情。

"How in the hell can I be worried about that idiot right now?" she asked audibly. "He's most likely in some cell right now anyway like Misato said, so its not like I can even do anything about it. But even so-AHHHHH," she yelled in frustration.  
“我他妈的现在怎么还在担心那个白痴？”她大声自问，“他现在多半像美里说的那样，被关在某个牢房里，我根本无能为力。但即便如此——啊啊啊，”她懊恼地大喊。

'Stop thinking about him...right think of something else...umm...breakfast tomorrow. Right! I'm going to have Misato take me out some place tomorrow for penance.'  
“别再想他了……现在想想别的……嗯……明天的早餐。对了！我要让美里明天带我去某个地方作为补偿。”

But thinking about food only made her remember the fried rice that he had made, and if anything, this only brought her thoughts back to him stronger then before.  
但一想到食物，她脑海中便浮现出他做的那盘炒饭，而这样一来，她的思绪反而比之前更加强烈地回到了他身上。

'I can still remember the taste,' she thought miserably, 'and why does my hear beat like crazy every time I think of him?'  
'我依然记得那个味道，'她痛苦地想，'为什么每次想到他，我的心都跳得如此疯狂？'

"Arghhhh!" she yelled up towards the sky. "This is so annoying, I just want to see him so I can punch his stupid face in and then forget about him. Idiot!"  
“啊啊啊！”她对着天空大喊，“这太烦人了，我只想见他一面，狠狠揍他那张蠢脸，然后彻底忘掉他。笨蛋！”

As though this settled the matter, Asuka pushed off against the metal railing and stepped towards the front door of the apartment. Turning around one final time to look up at the sky, she thought she glimpsed the North Star, brightest of all stars in the night sky. Smiling slightly, she thought, 'In a way, its just like me...all alone with nobody around.'  
仿佛这样就解决了问题，明日香推开金属栏杆，走向公寓的前门。她最后一次转身抬头望向天空，觉得自己瞥见了北极星，那是夜空中最亮的星。她微微一笑，心想：‘在某种程度上，它就像我一样...独自一人，周围空无一人。’

But that wasn't true, because even if they couldn't be seen, billions of star littered the sky. Asuka however at this time truly felt the loneliness of her life, because it was true that she had nobody around her. Even Misato would eventually fade out of her life as time passed.  
但这并不完全正确，因为即使看不见，天空中仍有数十亿颗星星点缀。然而，此刻的明日香真切地感受到了生活的孤独，因为她的确身边空无一人。即使是美里，随着时间的流逝，也终将从她的生活中淡出。

"I don't need anyone," she whispered. "I fight only for myself, and live only for myself. I don't need anyone..."  
“我不需要任何人，”她低声自语，“我只为自己而战，只为自己而活。我不需要任何人...”

But wasn't she just lying to herself, just as everybody else was lying to her?  
但她不也是在自欺欺人吗，正如其他人都在欺骗她一样？

Ignoring this question, she walked towards the front door and silently opened it. Even though it was unlikely, she didn't want to risk waking Misato up. She was sure to berate her about leaving the apartment so late at night.  
她无视这个问题，走向前门，默默地打开了它。尽管可能性不大，但她不想冒险吵醒美里。她肯定会因为深夜离开公寓而训斥她。

Walking into her own bedroom, she closed the door deafly behind herself, and threw herself down onto her futon. Rolling over onto her back, she pressed the back of her right hand against her forehead and let out a low sigh. Opening eyes that had been closed the minute she hit her futon, she didn't like the coldness that seeped through the loose tank top she was wearing and penetrated her skin. Her bed felt alien to her, like somebody else completely foreign to her slept in it each day.  
走进自己的卧室，她无声地关上门，猛地扑倒在她的蒲团上。翻身仰躺，她用右手背抵住额头，发出一声低沉的叹息。闭上的眼睛在她碰到蒲团的那一刻就睁开了，她不喜欢透过宽松背心渗透进皮肤的冰冷感。她的床对她来说很陌生，就像每天都有一个完全陌生的人睡在上面。

'Maybe thats why I'm having difficulty sleeping, because I don't know myself anymore,' she thought.  
'也许这就是我难以入睡的原因，因为我不再了解自己了，'她心想。

Rolling over onto her side, she grabbed the small object on her bedside table, and clasping it in both hands, she held it against her chest.  
她翻身侧躺，伸手从床头柜上抓起那个小物件，双手紧握，将其贴在胸前。

Like this, she eventually fell into a troubled sleep, where everything was black, but she kept running through the blackness as though she was searching for something.  
就这样，她最终陷入了不安的睡眠，四周一片漆黑，但她不停地在黑暗中奔跑，仿佛在寻找着什么。

When Shinji woke up early that morning, it took him a while to realize he was even awake, as the darkness inside his cell was little different with his eyes open than closed.  
那天清晨，真嗣早早醒来，好一会儿才意识到自己已经醒了，因为牢房内的黑暗在他睁眼与闭眼时几乎无甚差别。

Rolling over onto his side, he accidentally brushed against the cuffs that he had broken last night with his AT-field. At the feel of the cold metal against his skin, the memory of yesterdays events came rushing back to him.  
他翻身侧躺，不小心碰到了昨晚用 AT 力场破坏的镣铐。冷冰冰的金属触感让他皮肤一紧，昨日种种瞬间涌上心头。

Shinji wasn't honestly sure how he felt about o the whole thing. Yes he was still stunned and shocked by everything that had happened, but it was more like, he just didn't care who he really was anymore. So what if the person he thought was his father all his life turned out to be an impostor, an impostor moreover after nothing more than his DNA. So what if it turned out that he was the byproduct of a human and a being equivalent to a god. So what if he was all alone now. It didn't faze him; he would continue to push forward.  
真嗣并不确切知道自己对此作何感想。没错，他仍对所发生的一切感到震惊和愕然，但更多的是，他已不在乎自己究竟是谁。就算那个他一直视为父亲的人原来是个冒牌货，而且仅仅是为了他的 DNA；就算他发现自己是一个人与神级存在的产物；就算现在他孤身一人。这些都未能动摇他，他会继续前行。

Standing up, he walked to the small crack in the walls were the door was and the only light the penetrated the darkness of his cell. Using his fully awakened angel powers, he could still feel the guards that were stationed next to his cell. If he had to describe their AT-fields, it would be something like a beating heart. But it went further than that.  
他站起身，走向那扇门所在的小墙缝，那是唯一一束穿透他牢房黑暗的光。借助完全觉醒的天使之力，他仍能感知到驻守在他牢房旁的守卫。如果要形容他们的 AT 力场，那就像一颗跳动的心脏。但这远不止于此。

Maybe it had something to do with his visions, which he somewhat understood better because of what Kaoru had said. He could see what they would do before they did it. The nerve pulses that were sent to the brain that made them live out their daily lives. But he could change all that if he pleased. It seemed that he had grown not only to shape the people that he knew's futures, but now also those that he didn't knew. If he chose to do one thing right then and there, like breaking down the cell door, their lives would be forfeit. They would not die by his hand, but by someone else's hand, by letting him escape. But they weren't the only ones that would be affected, and Shinji knew this, so thats why he decided to do nothing. Even as he thought of saying something through the thick metal doors that he was incased in, he saw the change of the guards life as though it was a pop-out picture book that folded out before him.  
或许这与他的预知有关，多亏了薰的话，他对这些预知有了更深的理解。他能在事情发生前看到它们。那些传递到大脑的神经脉冲，让他们的日常生活得以展开。但如果他愿意，他可以改变这一切。似乎他不仅能够塑造他所认识的人的未来，现在连那些他不认识的人的未来也能影响。如果他当时选择做一件事，比如打破牢门，他们的生命就会因此终结。他们不会死于他手，而是因他的逃脱而死于他人之手。但受影响的不仅仅是他们，真嗣明白这一点，所以他没有采取任何行动。即便他想着通过厚重的金属门说些什么，他也能像翻开一本立体图画书一样，预见到守卫生命的变迁。

It would be better if he didn't interact with another human being for the remainder of his life.  
如果他余生不再与任何人接触，或许会更好。

Even as he thought this, he felt another AT-field nearing him, and a few seconds later, heard the hinges of his cell door creaking as it was opened.  
尽管他这么想，他还是感觉到另一个 AT 力场正在接近，几秒钟后，他听到了牢门铰链的吱嘎声，门被打开了。

Light pierced Shinji's eyes as the door opened, and for a moment, Shinji felt as though the sun had descended from the skies and blinded him. However, as his eyes became used to the light, he recognized the silhouette of Fuyutsuki standing in front of him. This only angered him, as it reminded him of that bastard.  
光线穿透了真嗣的眼睛，门一打开，有那么一刻，真嗣感觉太阳仿佛从天而降，让他目眩。然而，当他的眼睛适应了光线后，他认出了站在他面前的冬月副司令的轮廓。这让他更加愤怒，因为它提醒了他那个混蛋。

Fuyutsuki stood in the opened doorway for a minute, looking at the boy in front of him. He had known about Shinji's true nature for as long as Gendo had, and had been at the hospital as Yui gave birth to Shinji. Though he held no blame in the matter, he still felt remorseful for keeping it from Shinji for so long. The boy in many ways reminded him of Yui.  
冬月站在敞开的门口，凝视着面前的少年。他和源堂一样，很早就知道真嗣的真实身份，也在医院见证了唯生下真嗣的时刻。尽管他在这件事上并无过错，但他仍然为对真嗣隐瞒了这么久而感到内疚。这个少年在很多方面让他想起了唯。

"I am glad to see that you didn't try anything rash Shinji," said Fuyutsuki in an attempt to start conversation.  
“我很高兴你没有做出什么冲动的事，真嗣。”冬月试图开始对话。

Shinji remained completely silent, staring back at him with those blood red eyes, the dark brown forever gone out of them.  
真嗣完全沉默着，用那双血红色的眼睛回望着他，深棕色永远从其中消失了。

"I'm sure that you are hungry by now...and thirsty. If you'll follow me, we can take care of some of the more essential things."  
"我肯定你现在饿了...也渴了。如果你跟我来，我们可以解决一些更基本的需求。"

"And then what?" asked Shinji with as little emotion as was humanly possible.  
"然后呢？" 真嗣尽可能毫无感情地问道。

Fuyutsuki seemed puzzled at his question, asking, "What do you mean?"  
冬月对他的问题似乎感到困惑，问道：“你是什么意思？”

"I'm not being kept alive because I'm useful anymore am I? That bastard already has Adams DNA..._my_ DNA, so why don't you just kill me."  
“我已经不再是因为有用才被留活口了，对吧？那个混蛋已经有了亚当的 DNA...我的 DNA，那为什么不直接杀了我。”

Fuyutsuki was taken aback at the unwavering of his voice.  
冬月对他的声音中坚定不移的态度感到震惊。

"Do you desire death Shinji?"  
"你渴望死亡吗，真嗣？"

"No, but I do desire an end to everything, and if death can grant that to me, than I will accept it."  
"不，但我渴望一切的终结，如果死亡能赋予我这个，那么我会接受它。"

Fuyutsuki stared at him, but no matter how he tried to pick apart the expression on Shinji's face, he couldn't know if what he was saying was true. Shinji had become so different that Fuyutsuki would never have guessed that he had known the boy since birth. But somehow he had still managed to maintain his human mind, which by itself was astounding.  
冬月盯着他，但无论他如何试图剖析真嗣脸上的表情，都无法判断他所说的是否真实。真嗣变得如此不同，以至于冬月无法相信自己从他出生起就认识他。但不知何故，他仍然设法保持了人类的思维，这本身就令人惊叹。

Sighing slightly, Fuyutsuki said, "As to your question, killing you would be nothing short of murder. As for whether you serve a purpose or not to Nerv, Seele will likely interfere with us very soon."  
微微叹息，冬月说道：“关于你的问题，杀你无异于谋杀。至于你是否对 NERV 有用，Seele 很快就会插手干涉我们。”

Shinji sneered, knowing that it was not really Nerv, but that bastard who decided whether he was usable or not. Seele however...  
真嗣冷笑，他知道决定自己是否有用的并非 NERV，而是那个混蛋。至于 Seele……

"What does Seele plan on doing?"  
“Seele 打算做什么？”

"Initiating Third Impact with the Eva series implanted with the S2 engines."  
"启动搭载 S2 引擎的 Eva 系列，引发第三次冲击。"

"Is that all?" asked Shinji as he raised an eyebrow.  
"就这样？" 真嗣挑了挑眉问道。"

Fuyutsuki frowned slightly but said, "It is speculated that they will try to capture you and forcefully use the DNA you were born with to help initiate Third Impact. Most likely, they will go after the other Eva pilots also, as the Evangelions can only hinder their plans now."  
冬月微微皱眉，说道："据推测，他们可能会试图抓捕你，并强行利用你出生时所携带的 DNA 来协助引发第三次冲击。很可能，他们也会对其他 Eva 驾驶员下手，因为现在 Eva 只能阻碍他们的计划。"

"Do they know about me?"  
"他们知道我的存在吗？"

"Yes. Gendo was able to keep them in the dark for a while, erasing all of the original copies of your birth records and replacing himself as the father in the forged documents. But they were able to track down the doctors who supervised the birth, and unfortunately there were a lot of them."  
"是的。源渡曾设法让他们蒙在鼓里一段时间，抹除了所有原始的出生记录副本，并在伪造的文件中将自己替换为父亲。但他们还是找到了负责接生的医生们，不幸的是，这样的人还不少。"

Shinji wanted to ask what kind of pain his mother went through to give birth to him, and whether Fuyutsuki knew about how Adam had even come to impregnate his mother. But the thought put him off slightly, knowing that he wouldn't like the answer, and besides, now wasn't the time.  
真嗣想问他的母亲为了生下他经历了怎样的痛苦，以及冬月是否知道亚当是如何使他母亲怀孕的。但这个念头让他有些退缩，因为他知道不会喜欢那个答案，而且，现在也不是时候。

"The other Eva pilots? Asuka and Rei, what are you going to do with them?"  
“其他 EVA 驾驶员呢？明日香和绫波，你们打算怎么处理她们？”

"Unit 00 is destroyed, and Unit 02 is badly damaged, but emergency repairs have started on it since last night. Rei will be kept in a secure location incase the Geofront and Nerv is infiltrated. With luck though, Unit 02 will be repaired enough to help defend the Geofront."  
“零号机被毁，二号机严重受损，但从昨晚开始已经进行了紧急维修。绫波将被安置在安全地点，以防地底都市和 NERV 被渗透。不过，幸运的话，二号机将修复到足以协助保卫地底都市的程度。”

Shinji felt a small surge of anger deep within a closed off section of his mind as he retorted, "So you're going to use Asuka as a toy again, using her when you need her and then throwing her away."  
真嗣内心深处封闭的一角涌起一股怒火，他反驳道：“所以你又要利用明日香当工具了，需要她时就利用，不需要时就抛弃。”

Fuyutsuki was ashamed of Shinji's statement and it clearly showed on his face. But it was something the commander had ordered.  
冬月对真嗣的言论感到羞愧，这一点明显地表现在他的脸上。但这是司令下达的命令。

"She is an invaluable pilot to Nerv, and would help much with the defense of the Geofront. If Unit 02 is not restored however, she will be kept at a secure bunker deep under Central Dogma with Rei."  
她是 NERV 不可或缺的驾驶员，对地底都市的防御大有帮助。但如果二号机未能修复，她将与绫波一起被安置在中央教条深处的安全掩体内。

Shinji couldn't help but laugh inwardly. Asuka would relish the idea of being closed in a room with Ayanami.  
真嗣忍不住在心里暗笑。明日香肯定会乐于接受与绫波共处一室的提议。

"What of myself then?" “那我自己呢？”

Fuyutsuki shrugged as he said, "That depends on your on decision."  
“那取决于你自己的决定。” 冬月耸了耸肩说道。

Shinji paused for a moment, mulling over everything Fuyutsuki had told him in his mind. He knew Seele was still a problem, and that sooner or later, everyone inside Nerv would have to make a stand against them. They wanted to be the gods of a newly created world, created by them, and ruled by them. The freedom of choice would be gone, something that Kaoru had admired about humans. But still...that bastard was another problem...and Lilith...  
真嗣停顿了一下，在脑海中反复思考着冬月告诉他的所有事情。他知道 Seele 仍然是个问题，迟早，Nerv 内部的每个人都将不得不与他们对抗。他们想要成为新创造世界的神，由他们创造，由他们统治。选择的自由将会消失，这是薰所钦佩的人类的特质。但即便如此...那个混蛋又是另一个问题...还有莉莉丝...

"Any idea on when they may take action?" asked Shinji suddenly.  
“你知道他们什么时候会采取行动吗？”真嗣突然问道。

"I don't know," replied Fuyutsuki, "but the defense budget has slowly been cut, and the news of their agent dying should have reached them by now. We expect two days, maybe three at most."  
“我不清楚，”冬月回答，“但国防预算一直在慢慢削减，他们的特工死亡的消息应该已经传到他们那里了。我们预计最多两到三天。”

"What can we do in that amount of time?" mumbled Shinji.  
“这么短的时间内我们能做什么？”真嗣喃喃自语。

"Not much admittedly. With the angels now defeated, the Japanese government see's no reason they should continue backing us, but most likely its simply Seele interfering with the decisions of the higher ups in the government. Dogma has sufficient means of defending itself incase of attack, but the defense will not likely keep other humans out for long. Ironic that even though the angels are defeated, man once again becomes its own enemy."  
"老实说，不多。既然天使已被击败，日本政府认为没有理由继续支持我们，但很可能是 Seele 在干预政府高层的决策。Dogma 有足够的手段防御攻击，但防御不太可能长时间阻挡其他人类。讽刺的是，尽管天使已被击败，人类再次成为自己的敌人。"

Shinji snorted at that, knowing how true it was.  
对此，真嗣嗤之以鼻，深知其真实性。

"And so, what do you plan on doing?"  
"那么，你打算怎么做？"

"Its not like I really have a choice," said Shinji.  
"“我又不是真的有选择，”真嗣说。”

"You could leave Nerv if you really desired it. The angels are defeated, and you have no reason to fight other humans, nor do you wish it. You are not bound here anymore."  
“如果你真的渴望离开 NERV，你可以这么做。使徒已经被击败，你没有理由再与其他人类战斗，也不希望如此。你不再被束缚在这里了。”

"But I am bound by the people here," said Shinji.  
"“但我被这里的人所束缚，”真嗣说。”

As to that, Fuyutsuki didn't have any reply to throw at Shinji.  
对于这一点，冬月并没有什么可以反驳真嗣的话。

Staring at his feet for a moment, Shinji shook his head briefly as though seeing the outcome of something in the future. Sighing slightly, he raised his head as he said, "I'm not promising anything, not to you, not to that bastard, but I do owe it to the personal that work here."  
真嗣盯着地面片刻，轻轻摇头，仿佛预见了未来的某种结果。他微微叹息，抬起头说道：“我不会向你们承诺任何事，无论是对你，还是对那个混蛋，但我确实欠这里的员工们一个交代。”

Even as he accepted this, he saw a brief vision of the destruction of Nerv, and the death of many people. He saw Misato dead, Ritsuko dead, Kaji dead, and so on and so forth. Everybody he had known, everybody he had shared a bond with in some way or another, he saw possible deaths of them. And Asuka...  
尽管他接受了这一点，却短暂地预见了 NERV 的毁灭和许多人的死亡。他看到美里死了，律子死了，加持死了，等等等等。每一个他认识的人，每一个与他有过某种联系的人，他都看到了他们可能的死亡。而明日香……

Shaking off this last vision, he looked up to see Fuyutsuki frowning at him. His obvious lapse in silence seemed to not have gone unnoticed.  
甩开这最后一幕，他抬头看到冬月正皱眉看着他。他明显的沉默疏忽似乎并未被忽视。

"Are you okay Shinji?" he asked.  
“你还好吗，真嗣？”他问道。

"Fine," replied Shinji knowing that a dark shadow most have passed over his face briefly as he saw everything.  
“还好，”真嗣回答，知道自己脸上一定短暂掠过了一丝阴霾，因为他看到了一切。

"Now if you don't mind, I'll take up that offer from earlier."  
"现在如果你不介意，我就接受之前的那份提议了。"

Fuyutsuki couldn't help but smile.  
冬月忍不住微笑起来。

"I'll have it all arranged, and there is somebody who wants to see you also."  
"我会安排妥当，而且还有个人想见你。"

Shinji narrowed his blood red eyes in response to this statement.  
真嗣听到这话，血红色的眼睛微微眯起。

"Who would care to see me?"  
“谁会愿意来看我呢？”

"You should be able to figure that out," replied Fuyutsuki as he left Shinji's cell, motioning to the guards on either side of the wall to relax.  
“你应该能猜到的，”冬月回答道，离开真嗣的牢房时，示意两边墙上的守卫放松警惕。

Shinji followed Fuyutsuki at a few paces behind him, thinking about what he had said. He guessed who the person was, but that didn't mean he had to like it.  
真嗣跟在副司令冬月身后，保持几步的距离，心中反复思索着他刚才的话。他猜到了那个人是谁，但这并不意味着他必须接受。

---

Maybe persons would have been a better phrase.  
或许用‘人’这个词会更恰当。

Shinji couldn't help but glare at the two people seated at the table in front of him.  
真嗣忍不住瞪向坐在他面前桌子旁的两个人。

They weren't in the cafeteria of Nerv, since his presence there would make most people nervous. No, they were in a separate room used mainly for conferences. In the middle of the room was an oval table with six chairs placed around it. Currently only two of the chairs were occupied, but Shinji was damn well determined to not make it three, even with the generous amount of food laid on the table.  
他们并没有在 Nerv 的食堂，因为他的出现会让大多数人感到紧张。不，他们在一个主要用于会议的独立房间里。房间中央是一张椭圆形桌子，周围摆放着六把椅子。目前只有两把椅子被占用，但真嗣坚决不打算让它变成三把，尽管桌子上摆满了丰盛的食物。

'Isn't this a bit desperate?' he thought as he looked at the food. He guessed they were going to try and keep him here by starving him next. Honestly, he had rather hoped that when his angel half took over, the need to eat would no longer be necessary, but that didn't seem to be the case.  
“这不是有点绝望吗？”他看着食物心想。他猜他们接下来会试图通过饿着他来留住他。说实话，他本以为当他的天使半身接管后，进食的需求就不再必要了，但似乎并非如此。

Standing with his hands at this sides, he addressed the two seated at the table.  
他双手垂在身侧，对坐在桌前的两人说道。

"Exactly why are you two here?"  
"你们俩到底为什么在这里？"

"I thought you would have been glad to see us Shinji," replied the woman with purple hair.  
""我还以为你会很高兴见到我们，真嗣。"" 紫发女子回答道。

"If thats what you thought, you're sorely mistaken," replied Shinji gruffly.  
""如果你这么想，那就大错特错了。"" 真嗣粗声粗气地回答。

"Shinji-" tried Misato. "真嗣——" 美里试图开口。

But the girl next to her cut her off.  
但旁边的女孩打断了她。

"Ah just leave the idiot alone Misato," said the girl with fiery hair acidly, "he obviously doesn't care whether we're here or not."  
"啊，就让那个白痴自己待着吧，美里，" 红发女孩尖刻地说，"他显然不在乎我们是否在这里。"

"You're right, I don't," said Shinji exasperatingly as he rounded on Asuka.  
"你说得对，我不懂，" 真嗣恼火地说道，转身面对明日香。

Asuka glared at him hatefully, staring back into his sunken eyes. After a few moments though, she had to turn her head away.  
明日香恨恨地瞪着他，直视他那凹陷的双眼。但过了一会儿，她不得不转过头去。

"God damn it, why the hell did I agree to come along," groaned Asuka as she crossed her legs in irritation.  
"该死，我他妈为什么要同意一起来，" 明日香烦躁地交叉双腿，抱怨道。

Misato held her tongue, though all the while thinking, 'Weren't you just wanting to see him yesterday?'  
美里忍住了话头，心里却想着：‘你昨天不是还急着想见他吗？’

Looking back at Shinji, she said, "How do you feel? Are you hurt or-"  
回头看向真嗣，她问道：“你感觉怎么样？有没有受伤或者——”

"I'm perfectly fine," said Shinji with clenched teeth.  
"“我完全没事。”真嗣咬着牙说。

"You're lying. Nobody would be the same after what you've been through."  
"你在撒谎。经历了那些事，没人会一成不变。"

"And what exactly have I been through!" retorted Shinji.  
"我究竟经历了什么！" 真嗣反驳道。"

Misato simply stared back at him before she said quietly, "I heard about everything...Adam...and the commander."  
美里只是静静地盯着他，然后轻声说道："我听说了所有的事……亚当……还有司令。"

Shinji's eyes widened as Misato uttered this simple sentence. Shinij had never guessed that Misato would have learned about that.  
真嗣的眼睛因美里这句简单的话而睁大了。真嗣从未料到美里会知道那件事。

"Where...did you hear that?" asked Shinji after a few seconds pause. All the fight and arrogance seemed to have evaporated out of him.  
“你……从哪儿听来的？”真嗣在几秒钟的停顿后问道。所有的斗志和傲气似乎都从他身上消失了。

"From the guard that carried your unconscious body away. He told me only what he heard, but I understood enough to piece it together."  
“从那个把你昏迷的身体抬走的守卫那里。他只告诉了我他听到的，但我已经足够拼凑出真相了。”

"So then you know...about me and Adam then," whispered Shinji.  
“那么，你知道了……我和亚当的事。” 真嗣低声说道。

Misato was silent, and really, words weren't needed anymore. Asuka meanwhile had uncrossed her legs and rested one arm on the table, placing her chin in the palm of her hand. Out of the corner of her eye, she watched Shinji slowly seem to dissolve on the spot.  
美里沉默不语，实际上，已经不需要更多言语了。与此同时，明日香松开了交叉的双腿，一只手臂搁在桌上，将下巴靠在掌心。她用眼角余光观察着真嗣，只见他似乎当场就要崩溃。

'God damn it! This idiot infuriates me,' she thought spitefully.  
“该死的！这个白痴真让我火大，”她心怀怨恨地想。

After a few seconds of waiting for Shinji to do something, Misato finally raised her chin and asked, "Shin-"  
在等待了几秒钟，看真嗣是否会有所行动后，美里最终抬起下巴问道：“真-”

But Shinji took a few hasty steps forward and threw himself down on one of the plastic chairs placed around the table and grabbed every plate within reach of his arms and started devouring the food. He didn't realize how hungry his was until just then. Across the table from him, Misato let out a sigh of relief, while Asuka had to hold back the snide comment she longed to throw at his face.  
但真嗣急忙向前走了几步，扑通一声坐到桌子周围的一张塑料椅子上，伸手抓起触手可及的所有盘子，开始狼吞虎咽地吃起食物来。直到那时，他才意识到自己有多饿。坐在他对面的美里松了一口气，而明日香则不得不忍住想要对他冷嘲热讽的冲动。

Pausing for a minute from gorging himself, Shinji swallowed loudly and asked Misato, "I don't think its smart if you shout about it though, you weren't meant to know about this."  
真嗣从狼吞虎咽中停顿了一下，大声咽下食物后问美里：“我觉得你大声嚷嚷不太明智，你本不该知道这些的。”

"I know," said Misato as she leaned back in her chair. "Yesterday, when I learned about it, I was afraid of what would happen if it was discovered that I knew. I left with Asuka hurriedly and didn't intend to come back for a week or so."  
"我知道，" 美里靠在椅背上说道，"昨天得知这件事时，我害怕如果被人发现我知道内情会发生什么。我急忙和明日香一起离开，没打算一周左右回来。"

"That would never have worked," replied Shinji.  
"那样根本行不通，" 真嗣回答道。"

"No, I suppose it wouldn't. But I didn't want to take a chance nonetheless."  
"是啊，我想也是。但我还是不想冒险。"

"So what did you plan to do with this information?" asked Shinji in between bites of scrambled eggs. Across the table from him, Asuka's stomach started rumbling. Breakfast wasn't very adequate that morning, but then again, it never really was.  
"那你打算用这些信息做什么？" 真嗣一边吃着炒蛋一边问道。坐在他对面的明日香肚子开始咕咕叫。那天早上的早餐并不丰盛，但话说回来，早餐从来都不怎么丰盛。

"I don't really know," said Misato after she thought about it. "There was no way I could talk about it, and lets face it, nobody would believe me."  
"我也不太清楚，" 美里想了想后说，"我没办法谈论这件事，而且说真的，没人会相信我。"

"So then why did you come back?"  
"那你为什么还要回来？"

"Seele," replied Misato simply.  
"Seele," 美里简单地回答道。

Shinji paused as he was about to take a drink of orange juice, and lowered his glass.  
真嗣在即将喝一口橙汁时停顿了一下，放下了杯子。

"Fuyutsuki told me they would start moving soon, with there agent gone and everything."  
"冬月告诉我他们很快就会开始行动，随着他们的特工消失，一切都将启动。"

"Yes, but they would have done something anyway. This just gives them an excuse."  
"是的，但他们无论如何都会做些什么。这只是给了他们一个借口。"

"True," said Shinji as he drained his glass.  
"确实，" 真嗣说着，喝干了杯中的酒。"

Misato watched him eat for a minute before she asked a question that had been nagging at her.  
美里看着他吃了一会儿，然后问出了一个一直困扰着她的问题。

"How...different is it?" "有多...不同呢？"

"Different? What?" asked Shinji as he chewed his food.  
"不同？什么不同？" 真嗣边嚼着食物边问。

"You're eyes for starters," said Misato as she pointed at Shinji's face. "And even your hair is a little lighter in color."  
"首先是你眼睛的颜色，" 美里指着真嗣的脸说，"还有你的头发颜色也稍微浅了一些。"

"It is?" asked Shinji as he looked around as though expecting to find a mirror. Knowing a mirror was anywhere close to him though, he sighed and said, "I'm still myself, that will never change. But I-" Shinji looked from Misato and then to Asuka who was staring at the food in front of Shinji.  
"是吗？" 真嗣环顾四周，仿佛期待找到一面镜子。尽管知道附近并没有镜子，他叹了口气说，"我还是我，这一点永远不会改变。但我——" 真嗣从美里看向明日香，她正盯着真嗣面前的食物。

"I can feel your AT-fields," finished Shinji.  
"我能感受到你们的 AT 力场，" 真嗣补充道。

"You can?" asked Misato while blinking her eyes.  
"你能感受到？" 美里眨着眼睛问道。

Shinji nodded and said, "I could feel them before, just not as strongly. While every human has an AT-field, they're not as distinct as the angels were. If I had to describe it, it feels like a beating heart."  
真嗣点点头说：“我之前能感觉到它们，只是没这么强烈。虽然每个人都有 AT 力场，但它们不像使徒那样明显。如果要形容的话，感觉就像一颗跳动的心脏。”

"But you feel no different?"  
“但你感觉没什么不同吗？”

"No I do, but I'm able to control it."  
“不，我感觉到了，但我能控制它。”

Misato understood then that Shinji wished to end the conversation. It wasn't something that he was keen on talking about. Turning to her right, she almost laughed as she could have sworn she saw a small dribble of drool sliding out of the corner of Asuka's mouth.  
美里这时明白了，真嗣是想结束对话。这不是他愿意谈论的话题。她转向右边，差点笑出声来，因为她确信自己看到明日香嘴角有一丝口水滑落。

"Asuka, if you're hungry, you can eat you know."  
“明日香，如果你饿了，你可以吃东西的。”

"Huh? What? No, I'm not hungry..."  
“啊？什么？不，我不饿……”

"Then how come you're staring at the food?" asked Misato.  
“那你怎么还盯着食物看？”美里问道。

"Not hungry!" shouted Asuka as her stomach made a sound similar to that of a lion roaring.  
“不饿！”明日香喊道，与此同时她的肚子发出了一声类似狮吼的声音。

Misato did laugh this time as Asuka's stomach gave a loud grumble; even Shinji was smiling slightly.  
这次美里真的笑了，明日香的肚子发出了一声响亮的咕噜声；就连真嗣也微微露出了笑容。

Feeling slightly embarrassed at her involuntary actions, Asuka felt her cheeks heat of slightly. Looking over at Shinji, she mistook his smile for a smirk and yelled, "Damn it...fine!"  
因自己无意识的行为感到些许尴尬，明日香觉得脸颊微微发热。她瞥向真嗣，误将他的微笑当作嘲笑，便喊道：“该死……好吧！”

Leaning over the table, she grabbed the plate directly in front of Shinji, and lifted it over to her side.  
她俯身越过桌子，直接抓起真嗣面前的那盘食物，将其挪到自己这边。

'See, you were hungry,' thought Misato silently as Asuka grabbed a knife and fork to the right of her.  
“看吧，你果然饿了。”美里默默想着，明日香随即拿起她右侧的刀叉。

Feeling content, Shinji placed both arms on the table and rested his chin in them.  
感到满足，真嗣将双臂放在桌上，下巴靠在手臂上。

"How long are you staying here for?" he asked Misato.  
“你打算在这里待多久？”他问美里。

"I don't know. If possible, I would like to see Ritsuko...unless you're willing to tell me what I wanted to know now that the battles ov-"  
“我不清楚。如果可能的话，我想见见律子……除非你现在就愿意告诉我那些战斗的——”

"Not a chance," said Shinji quickly.  
“绝不可能，”真嗣迅速回答道。

"So I figured," Misato said with a sigh. "I want to see the state of Unit 02 also though, so thats what we're going to do after-"  
“我就猜到了，”美里叹了口气说，“不过我也想看看 02 号机的状况，所以我们接下来就去做这个——”

Beside her, the sound of a fork and knife clattering onto a plate could be heard.  
在她旁边，可以听到叉子和刀子掉落在盘子上的声音。

Asuka turned to Misato and almost knocked Misato over with her shout.  
明日香转向美里，她的喊声几乎把美里撞倒。

"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO MY UNIT 02!"  
“我的 02 号机到底怎么了！”

'Oh shit,' thought Misato. She had forgotten to tell Asuka about the damages inflicted on Unit 02. Across the table, Shinji felt briefly ashamed, since it was his doing that had rendered the Eva Unit into a pile of scrap metal.  
“该死，”美里心想。她忘了告诉明日香 02 号机受损的事。桌子对面，真嗣感到一阵短暂的羞愧，因为正是他的行为让 Eva 变成了一堆废铁。

"Asuka hold on, calm down," said Misato in a desperate attempt to keep Asuka from breaking anything.  
"明日香，坚持住，冷静下来，" 美里绝望地试图阻止明日香摔碎任何东西。"

Asuka didn't bother listening though, and grabbed the nearest thing within her reach, which happen to be a glass, and flung it at Shinji's face.  
但明日香根本没在听，她抓起手边最近的东西，恰好是一个玻璃杯，猛地朝真嗣的脸扔去。

"THIS IS YOUR FAULT SOMEHOW YOU BASTARD!"  
"这全是你的错，你这个混蛋！"

Without blinking an eye, an eruption of orange appeared in front of Shinji shattering the glass as it neared his face. The broken pieces of glass turned to fine dust as they came into contact with Shinji's AT-field. His AT-field blocked the large pieces so that they wouldn't cut him, passing over both his shoulders. Shinji never broke his gaze as he continued staring at Asuka, his blood red eyes unblinking as they bored into her own ocean blue ones.  
毫不眨眼间，一团橙色在前方爆发，碎裂的玻璃在接近真嗣的脸庞时化为细尘。玻璃碎片在接触到真嗣的 AT 力场时化为粉末，他的 AT 力场阻挡了较大的碎片，使其不会割伤他，从他的双肩上掠过。真嗣始终没有移开目光，继续凝视着明日香，他那血红色的眼睛一眨不眨，深深地凝视着她那湛蓝如海的双眸。

Eventually though, Asuka had to break the contact with Shinji, but it wasn't the normal feeling that she felt when she looked at him. It was-  
然而，最终明日香不得不与真嗣的目光断开，但这并不是她平时看他时的那种感觉。这是——

She suddenly felt scared of him.  
她突然感到害怕他。

She had never felt scared of anything in her life, but this boy who was her own age gave off such a feeling that her legs felt like they might collapse under her.  
她一生中从未对任何事物感到害怕，但这个与她同龄的男孩却让她感到一种莫名的恐惧，仿佛双腿随时可能支撑不住。

Misato sat still, her eyes shifting back and forth between the two teens, waiting for one of them to make a move. Even she was shocked by Shinji's reaction. It seemed second nature to him now to use his AT-field, like it was as normal as walking.  
美里静静地坐着，目光在两个少年之间来回移动，等待着其中一人采取行动。就连她也被真嗣的反应震惊了。现在，使用 AT 力场对他来说似乎就像走路一样自然，成了他的第二天性。

Shinji stood up then so suddenly that the plastic chair tipped backwards, falling over so that its legs pointed towards the ceiling. Looking over at Asuka, he could see that she was determinedly not looking at him. Her bottom teeth were biting down on her lower lip in frustration but also-  
真嗣突然站了起来，塑料椅子向后翻倒，四条腿朝天。他看向明日香，发现她正坚决地不与他对视。她的下齿紧咬着下唇，既是出于沮丧，也——

'Its better like this,' thought Shinji. 'If she fears me, then its only easier.'  
'这样更好，' 真嗣心想。'如果她害怕我，那只会更简单。'

Turning around, Shinji stuck his hands in his pockets and opened the door to leave. Pausing for a second though, he looked out of the corner of his eyes. Asuka had not moved yet, and with her fists clenched, she seemed to be trying to muster up the courage to say something...or even do something.  
转过身，真嗣将双手插进口袋，打开了离开的门。不过，他停顿了一下，用眼角的余光瞥了一眼。明日香还没有动，她紧握着拳头，似乎在努力鼓起勇气说些什么……甚至做些什么。

Shinji thought it was oddly funny to see Asuka in a situation where she was afraid. But he knew that if she acted on her thoughts, and tried to hit him, he wasn't sure what would happen. Likely something that he regret for the rest of his life.  
看到明日香处于害怕的境地，真嗣觉得这有点滑稽。但他知道，如果她按照自己的想法行动，试图打他，他不确定会发生什么。很可能是他会后悔一辈子的事情。

Feeling himself calm down, he uttered a few words which he hoped would make things a little better.  
感觉到自己平静下来，他低声说了几句，希望能让情况稍微好转些。

"I'm truly sorry for what happened to Unit 02," said Shinji as he stood in the open doorway.  
“我对二号机发生的事感到非常抱歉，”真嗣站在敞开的门口说道。

"Do you think you can just say sorry and everything will be better!" Asuka screamed after him.  
“你以为说声对不起，一切就会变好吗！”明日香在他身后尖叫道。

Shinji shook his head for a second before he said, "Saying sorry is the first step towards forgiveness...but I don't really expect that from you."  
真嗣摇了摇头，片刻后说道：“说对不起是迈向原谅的第一步……但我并不真的指望你会这么做。”

"You're right! I won't ever forgive you!"  
“你说得对！我永远不会原谅你！”

But Asuka may as well have screamed that out of the window of fifty story building, because Shinji had already disappeared through the doorway.  
但明日香的话就像是从五十层楼高的窗户里喊出去一样，因为真嗣已经消失在门口了。

Asuka stared at the doorway for a while, before she slammed her right fist on the wooden table, upending a plate near her fist and spilling food onto the floor.  
明日香盯着门口好一会儿，然后猛地用右拳砸在木桌上，震翻了拳头附近的一个盘子，食物洒落一地。

'God damn it,' she thought. 'I should have just hit him...'  
'该死，'她心想。'我真该揍他一顿...'

---

"Its not too bad," said Misato as they stood in Unit 02's chamber.  
“也没那么糟，”美里站在二号机的驾驶舱里说道。

Asuka threw her a dirty look before she turned her attention back to her Unit 02.  
明日香朝她投去一个厌恶的眼神，随后又将注意力转回到她的零二号机上。

Both arms where missing, the head was smashed in, and according to the engineer, the chest cavity was filled with blood. How could this be considered as 'not too bad?'  
双臂缺失，头部被砸扁，而且据工程师所说，胸腔内充满了血液。这怎么能算是‘不算太糟’呢？

Turning towards Misato, Asuka groaned, "Are you kidding? It could take weeks to return it to what it looked before."  
明日香转向美里，抱怨道：“你在开玩笑吧？要让它恢复到之前的样子可能得花上几周时间。”

Misato sighed inwardly, thinking that Asuka only cared about the appearance.  
美里暗自叹息，心想明日香只在乎外表。

"And you heard what the engineer said," continued Asuka, "at most, they may able to repair an arm only."  
“而且你听工程师说的，”明日香继续道，“最多，他们可能只能修复一条手臂。”

"Well its better then what I had expected," said Misato.  
“好吧，这总比我想象的要好，”美里说。

Asuka was silent as she continued staring back at Unit 02.  
明日香沉默着，继续凝视着二号机。

"I am going to kill him," she mumbled.  
“我要杀了他，”她低声嘀咕。

Misato turned toward her and said very bluntly, "Don't get in his way."  
美里转向她，直截了当地说：“别挡他的路。”

"And why is that?" asked Asuka snappishly  
"为什么这么说？" 明日香不耐烦地问道

Did Misato really need to spell it out for her?  
真希波真的需要向她解释清楚吗？

"You should know, after seeing what he did early. And the expression on your face..." she finished, letting her voice die out.  
"你应该知道，早些时候他做了什么。还有你脸上的表情……" 她结束道，声音渐渐消失。

"He just caught me off guard is all," replied Asuka stubbornly.  
"他只是让我措手不及罢了，" 明日香固执地回答。

Continuing to stare back into the blank eyes of Unit 02 she couldn't help but feel like her pride had taken a sudden spiral downwards. Unit 02 was, and had been for the longest time, her life. It had been defeated though, and she felt like a piece of her heart had been broken. If she wasn't able to pilot Unit 02, then what reason did she have to exist?  
继续凝视着 02 号机空洞的双眼，她不禁感到自己的骄傲突然间急转直下。02 号机，长久以来一直是她的生命。尽管它已被击败，她却觉得自己的心碎了一块。如果她不能再驾驶 02 号机，那么她存在的理由又是什么？

"Asuka?" asked Misato, who had been worried about how Asuka would take this shocking sight, "You okay?"  
"明日香？" 美里问道，她一直担心明日香会如何接受这令人震惊的景象，"你还好吗？"

"Fine," mumbled Asuka as she continued staring back at the dismembered Unit 02. "Perfectly fine."  
“好啦，”明日香咕哝着，继续盯着被肢解的零二号机，“好得很。”

Misato knew she was lying.  
美里知道她在撒谎。

---

Shinji was mad at Misato for bringing Asuka along, but not nearly as mad as he was with himself.  
真嗣对美里带明日香来感到生气，但远不及他对自己的愤怒。

After storming the halls of Nerv without any clear objective in mind, during which he scared several personal so bad that he thought they may need therapy, he eventually wandered outside Central Dogma and into the Geofront. Walking aimlessly to the man made lake, he threw himself down on the ground and spread his arms and legs outward. Looking across the lake, Shinji could descry the elevator that he had taken down into the Geofront when he met Kaoru. It felt like an eternity ago that that happened.  
在毫无明确目标地冲进 Nerv 的走廊后，他吓坏了好几个人，以至于他觉得他们可能需要心理治疗，最终他漫无目的地走出了中央教条区，来到了地底都市。他无目的地走向人工湖，猛地扑倒在地，张开双臂和双腿。望着湖对面，真嗣能辨认出他初次遇见薰时乘坐的那部电梯。那感觉仿佛是上辈子的事了。

Raising his right hand into the air, he turned it over several times as though expecting it to look similar to that bastards hand with dead pieces of skin falling off it. Of course, no such thing happened.  
他举起右手在空中翻转了几下，仿佛期待着它看起来会像那混蛋的手一样，死皮脱落。当然，这种事并没有发生。

'If its true that I possess the DNA of Adam, because he is my real father, then I suppose my body wouldn't degrade, and I've used my own AT-field way to many times as it is.'  
'如果我拥有亚当的 DNA 是真的，因为他是我的亲生父亲，那么我想我的身体不会退化，而且我已经用过太多次自己的 AT 力场了。'

That was something he wondered about. Were there negative effects happening to his body because of his AT-field? He had numerous tests done on both his body and while he was piloting Unit 01, but nothing had ever been wrong, that he knew at least. Now though, with his angel genes completely dominant instead of recessive, he wondered if anything had changed inside him?  
这让他颇为疑惑。他的 AT 力场是否对他的身体产生了负面影响？他接受了无数次身体和驾驶初号机时的测试，但至少在他所知范围内，一切正常。然而现在，随着他的天使基因完全占据主导而非隐性，他不禁怀疑自己体内是否发生了什么变化？

Then there was the matter of his regeneration. He had heard that every cell in a humans body has a limited amount of times it can reproduce itself, or divide as it is better known as. So every time he got heavily injured and his damaged tissue repaired itself, it was logical to assume that his life expectancy was reduced every time his cells divided.  
再者就是他的再生能力。他听说过，人体内每个细胞的自我复制或分裂次数是有限的。因此，每次他受到重伤，受损组织自我修复时，逻辑上可以推断，每次细胞分裂都在缩短他的预期寿命。

He even remembered what Ritsuko said about the possibility to pass on the gene, but that was the last thing he was thinking about right now.  
他甚至记得赤木律子提到过遗传这种基因的可能性，但这却是他此刻最不愿考虑的事情。

No! Right now, and annoyingly enough, he couldn't get a certain red haired girl out of his fucking head.  
不！现在，烦人的是，他脑子里就是挥之不去那个红发女孩的身影。

He thought that it would have been easy enough forgetting about everything that they had been through, but the memories that he had of their time spent together was now just tormenting him. Before, he had cherished the memories, since that was really all he had with his feelings completely gone. Now though, and he suspected it had something to do with his angel self, every time he saw Asuka or even thought of her, he wanted to break everything in sight. The barrier that had kept his angel self at bay was gone, and all that remained were memories turned bitter. He even found himself wishing they could all be erased, so he could blissfuly go through the rest of his probably short life without them.  
他原以为忘记他们经历的一切会很容易，但如今，那些共同度过的时光记忆却成了折磨他的源头。以前，他珍惜这些记忆，因为那是他仅剩的情感寄托。可现在，他怀疑这与他的天使自我有关，每次看到明日香或只是想到她，他就想毁掉眼前的一切。阻挡他天使自我的屏障消失了，剩下的只有苦涩的回忆。他甚至发现自己希望这些记忆能被抹去，这样他就能愉快地度过余生，尽管可能并不长久。

He had somewhat expected to see her today, and had even prepared himself mentally before walking into the conference room, but the simple sight of her made him wanted to generate his AT-field and slice the entire table in half.  
他多少预料到今天会见到她，甚至在走进会议室前就做好了心理准备，但仅仅看到她的身影，他就想发动 AT 力场，把整张桌子劈成两半。

He was angry at himself for lashing out in anger when she had thrown the glass at him. He had created his AT-field without a second thought, like someone else was controlling his body within those few seconds of time. But he also wished that what he had done would distance herself from him. He knew that Asuka was incredibly stubborn though, and would be determined to put Shinji in his rightful place, namely with him on the ground and her foot pressed down over his face.  
他对自己在愤怒中爆发，当她向他扔玻璃杯时反击感到愤怒。他毫不犹豫地创造了 AT 力场，仿佛在那几秒钟内，有别人在操控他的身体。但他也希望自己的行为能让她远离自己。他知道明日香极其固执，决心要让真嗣回到他应有的位置，即被她踩在脚下，她的脚压在他的脸上。

Above all else though, he was afraid that the bitter memories that he now held would surface themselves physically, and he would strike her, who he had said before he would never hit, even if it meant he killed himself. He wasn't sure though anymore. His angel self fueled itself on anger and hatred, and unfortunately for him, he had plenty of that. The angels were created to protect the Tree of Life and kill off all humanity of if it came to that...but technically he wasn't an angel. Adam was a being similar to that of a god, he had only created the angels. But in a sense, he had created Shinji also...so then, maybe he was an angel?  
但最重要的是，他害怕自己现在怀有的痛苦记忆会以物理形式浮现，他会打她，那个他曾说过永远不会打的人，即使这意味着他可能会因此丧命。但他现在不确定了。他的天使自我是由愤怒和仇恨驱动的，不幸的是，他有很多这样的情绪。天使被创造出来是为了保护生命之树并消灭所有人类，如果情况如此的话……但从技术上讲，他不是天使。亚当是一个类似于神的存在，他只创造了天使。但在某种意义上，他也创造了真嗣……那么，也许他真的是个天使？

'Damn it,' yelled Shinji inwardly, 'everything's just too confusing now. I don't even know whats right and whats not!'  
“该死，”真嗣内心咆哮着，“现在一切都太混乱了。我甚至不知道什么是对的，什么是错的！”

Feeling anger suddenly surge through him and everything that had happened, not just in the past twenty-four hours, but over the course of his involvement with Nerv, he swung his right arm down bitterly in front of him.  
一股愤怒突然涌上心头，不仅仅是因为过去二十四小时发生的事情，还有他自加入 NERV 以来经历的一切，他痛苦地向前挥下右臂。

His AT-field shot outward, parting the lake as Moses had parted the Red Sea. Water shot upwards to the left and right of Shinji's AT-field, revealing the metal surface underneath all the water. The gap was so wide, that four men could walk abreast with relative ease.  
他的 AT 力场向外爆发，如同摩西分开红海一般将湖水分开。水花在真嗣的 AT 力场左右两侧冲天而起，露出了下方金属的表面。裂口如此之宽，四个男人并肩行走也相当轻松。

Shinji was relatively shocked, as he knew that his AT-field before was nowhere near powerful enough to create a miracle such as this. Now though, even miracles like this were possible.  
真嗣感到相当震惊，因为他知道之前自己的 AT 力场远没有强大到能创造这样的奇迹。但现在，即便是这样的奇迹也变得可能了。

All at once, the water that had been raised up to twenty feet alongside Shinji's AT-field crashed back downwards into the large gap that Shinji had created. The water filled back up quickly, creating large waves that crashed amongst one other. Eventually though, the water returned to its normal calm demeanor.  
突然间，随着真嗣的 AT 力场升起的水柱高达二十英尺，轰然坠回真嗣所创造的巨大缺口中。水迅速填满缺口，激起巨浪相互撞击。最终，水面恢复了往常的平静。

After the waves subsided, Shinji looked down at his right hand, surprised at how powerful his AT-field had become. If what he did was any indication, he probably wouldn't have much problem slicing a building cleanly in half. Not that he'd ever consider that of course.  
波涛平息后，真嗣低头看着自己的右手，惊讶于自己 AT 力场的强大。如果他刚才的表现能说明什么，那么他很可能毫不费力就能将一座建筑干净利落地切成两半。当然，他绝不会考虑这么做。

'By all rights, this level of power shouldn't even exist,' he thought. At the same time though, he was not only rejecting the Evangelions, but himself also.  
“按理说，这种程度的力量根本不应该存在。”他心想。然而与此同时，他不仅在拒绝 EVA，也在拒绝自己。

'Strangely enough though,' he thought, 'if I had never met Asuka, I wonder if any of this would have ever been possible? I'd still be the son of Adam, but would anything have ever come out of it if I had never met Asuka?' But when he thought about it more deeply, he realized that he had met Asuka through a chain of events. Leaving his old roommates place, moving in with Misato, hell, even moving to Tokyo-3 started everything in a sense.  
“说来也怪，”他思索着，“如果我从未遇见明日香，这一切是否还会发生？我依然是亚当之子，但如果从未遇见明日香，这一切还会发生吗？”但当他更深入地思考时，他意识到遇见明日香是通过一系列事件的连锁反应。离开旧室友的地方，搬去和美里住，甚至搬到第三新东京市，从某种意义上说，这一切都由此开始。

'Its our choices that change our futures,' thought Shinji, 'that I understand well enough. But its not just our choices, but the people around us who's choices can also change our futures. I suppose I'm the most clear example of that.'  
“是我们的选择改变了我们的未来，”真嗣想，“这一点我理解得很清楚。但不仅仅是我们的选择，还有我们周围人的选择也能改变我们的未来。我想我是最明显的例子。”

Everybody has the possibility to change anybody else, but Shinji is unique in that he can see the outcome of a choice. He can intervene and save somebody, or he can standby and watch them die, and so, he can shape peoples futures. And if he ever came into a position of power...  
每个人都有可能改变他人，但碇真嗣的独特之处在于他能看到一个选择的结果。他可以介入并拯救某人，或者袖手旁观，看着他们死去，从而塑造人们的未来。如果他有一天掌握了权力……

'Thats not something I should be thinking about,' he thought.  
“这不是我应该考虑的事情，”他心想。

What he wondered though, is how his visions related to Adam. Kaoru told him that he had something similar, and he mentioned seeing his own death as something of the sort. Shinji however could not see himself by himself, only in the futures of the people around him, and the reality of that was starting to fade away. It was almost as though he simply didn't exist. Adam had something to do with his visions, as did the fact that he's also a human. He knew humans could shape their own futures, but it was because of Adam that he was somehow able to see the possibility, and or outcome of that future.  
然而，他疑惑的是，他的预见与亚当有何关联。薰告诉他，自己也有类似的能力，甚至提到过预见自己的死亡。但碇真嗣无法独自看到自己，只能在他人的未来中看到自己，而这种现实感正逐渐消退。他几乎感觉自己仿佛不存在。亚当与他的预见有关，同样，他作为人类的身份也与此有关。他知道人类可以塑造自己的未来，但正是因为亚当，他才能以某种方式看到这种可能性，以及未来的结果。

'When did I become an intellectual?' thought Shinji, laughing inwardly at himself.  
"'我什么时候变成知识分子了？' 真嗣暗自笑道，自嘲地想着。

Standing up, he ignored the sand that clung to his pants and looked back towards the giant pyramid in the middle of the Geofront that was Central Dogma.  
他站起身来，无视粘在裤子上的沙粒，回头望向位于地底都市中央的那座巨大金字塔——中央教条区。

"Seele will take action soon," said Shinji as he gazed at Central Dogma. It looked so strong from here, but he knew that it couldn't hold out long against a siege. It had never been built with the idea of other humans attacking it.  
“Seele 很快就会采取行动了，”真嗣凝视着中央教条区说道。从这里看去，它显得如此坚固，但他清楚，面对围攻，它支撑不了多久。它从未被设计成能抵御人类攻击的样子。

A storm was coming, but he didn't know what it would bring.  
一场风暴即将来临，但他不知道它会带来什么。

Asuka picked idly at the food in front of her.  
明日香无聊地拨弄着面前的食物。

She was in the one of the many cafeteria's of Nerv, though admittedly, she wasn't sure what she was doing there. She had eaten hardly two hours ago, but Misato said that she had something to do, and that it wouldn't take long. Asuka didn't know how long ago she had said that, but she knew that it was taking way longer than it was expected.  
她身处 NERV 众多食堂中的一间，虽然坦白说，她也不确定自己在那里做什么。两小时前她几乎没吃什么东西，但美里说她有事要办，不会花太长时间。明日香不知道美里说这话已经过去多久了，但她知道这比预期的时间要长得多。

She felt useless, like a throwaway toy that once it outlived its usefulness, it was replaced by the new and improved version. In this case, she felt that _he_ was her replacement.  
她感到自己毫无用处，就像一个被抛弃的玩具，一旦失去了利用价值，就会被更新更好的版本所取代。在这个情况下，她觉得他就是她的替代品。

She felt like her life held no meaning right now. Being an Eva pilot was the only thing that proved that she existed, that she had a purpose; it was the only thing that proved the first ten years of her life weren't wasted. Everything that had happened to her with her father and her college days in Germany rushed back to her as bitter memories filled her head. She had been able to find sanctuary in being an Eva pilot, but _he_ had taken all that away from her.  
她觉得现在的生活毫无意义。成为一名 Eva 驾驶员是她证明自己存在的唯一方式，是她证明自己前十年的生活并非虚度的唯一途径。与父亲和在德国的大学时光相关的痛苦记忆涌上心头。成为 Eva 驾驶员曾是她的避难所，但他却夺走了这一切。

She blamed it all on _him._ If _he_ had never shown up,then she would still be the number one pilot. And earlier, what had happened when she had thrown the glass at his stupid face... She had never really thought of him as dangerous, even when she had heard that he had killed somebody before. But, when he had generated his AT-field to destroy the glass she threw at him without any hint of hesitation, she realized how different he really was. Was she really afraid of him? Asuka thought about this for a moment and didn't really know. He was just so...different compared to when she had first met him.  
她把一切都归咎于他。如果他从未出现，那么她仍将是头号驾驶员。还有之前，当她把玻璃杯扔向他那张愚蠢的脸时发生了什么...她从未真正认为他危险，即使她听说他以前杀过人。但是，当他毫不犹豫地生成 AT 力场摧毁她扔向他的玻璃杯时，她意识到他真的与众不同。她真的害怕他吗？明日香思考了一会儿，并不真正知道。与他初次见面时相比，他只是...太不一样了。

Dropping her fork onto the tray of food, she pushed it away with a disgusted look on her face. She wasn't even sure what she was doing here, after all, she had eaten earlier. But it was more like, the food from Nerv just tasted terrible now. She supposed that it was because of that stupid fried rice, though this thought only infuriated her even more.  
她把叉子丢在食物托盘上，一脸厌恶地推开。她甚至不确定自己在这里做什么，毕竟，她之前已经吃过了。但更像是，NERV 的食物现在尝起来太糟糕了。她猜想这可能是因为那盘愚蠢的炒饭，然而这个念头只让她更加愤怒。

Standing up suddenly, she knocked her elbow against the edge of the table and winced slightly as a sharp pain coursed through her for a brief instance. Looking out of the corner of her eye though, she caught a brief flash of something coming from the double doored entrance to the cafeteria. When she completely turned her head in that direction though, she didn't see anything or anyone.  
她猛地站起来，手肘撞到了桌边，一阵短暂的剧痛让她微微皱眉。然而，用眼角余光一瞥，她瞥见食堂双开门处有什么东西一闪而过。当她完全转向那个方向时，却什么也没看到，空无一人。

Hesitating slightly, she made up her mind though in the next second, and forced her feet to move. Walking rather fast, with her hair swinging behind her and her hands clenched into fists, she stormed through the cafeteria. Heads turned as they thought they saw a red headed demon storm past them, as though the apocalypse had come.  
她稍稍犹豫了一下，但下一秒就下定了决心，强迫自己迈开脚步。她快步走过食堂，头发在身后摆动，双手紧握成拳，气势汹汹。人们纷纷回头，以为看到了一个红发恶魔从身边疾驰而过，仿佛末日降临。

Coming to a halt outside the cafeteria doors, she turned to her left and looked down the white hallway just to see someone walk around the corner at the far end of the hallway. Feeling a smile stretch across her face, she started walking at a brisk pace to the corner she had seen the person disappear around.  
在食堂门口停下脚步，她转向左边，沿着白色的走廊望去，只见远处走廊尽头有人拐过弯去。她脸上绽开笑容，快步走向那人消失的拐角。

Peering around the corner, she caught the back of the persons head and couldn't help but smile.  
她探头望向拐角处，瞥见了那人的后脑勺，忍不住微微一笑。

'That bastard...' she thought.  
‘那个混蛋……’她心想。

Walking at an even pace, she evenly matched her foot falls with his and silently followed him.  
她步伐均匀地走着，脚步声与他同步，悄无声息地跟在他身后。

Shinji of course, on the other hand, already knew that she was following, and he laughed silently at that thought. It was amazing how arrogant Asuka could be at times.  
当然，真嗣早已察觉到她在跟踪，对此他暗自窃笑。有时候，明日香的自大真是令人惊叹。

'How did I ever like someone as crude, abrasive, and unloving as her?' The mere thought of what he used to think of her made him want to puke. The question however was: 'how long do I play this stupid game?'  
‘我怎么会喜欢上像她这样粗鲁、刻薄又不懂得爱的人呢？’光是想到自己曾经对她的看法，他就感到恶心。然而问题在于：‘我还要玩这个愚蠢的游戏多久？’

Shinji was amused by it. He knew that Asuka was behind him because he could feel her AT-field; the subsequent movements as she shifted from one foot to the other as she matched her pace with his. What he was curious though, was whether if he stopped, if she would do the same thing.  
真嗣对此感到有趣。他知道明日香就在他身后，因为他能感受到她的 AT 力场；她随着他的步伐，从一只脚换到另一只脚的细微动作。不过，他好奇的是，如果他停下来，她是否也会同样停下。

'May as well find out,' thought Shinji silently.  
“不妨一探究竟，”真嗣默默地想。

All at once, his footfalls came to a sudden stop and no more than twenty feet behind him, he knew that Asuka had come to a similar stop.  
突然间，他的脚步戛然而止，他知道，在他身后不到二十英尺的地方，明日香也停了下来。

'I never knew she could be this childish,' thought Shinji. 'Now...should I continue walking...or not?'  
“我从不知道她能这么孩子气，”真嗣心想。“现在……我该继续走……还是不走呢？”

He knew that Asuka wanted to say something to him, and he rather regret his actions from a few moments ago, but unfortunately, he couldn't help himself when he had seen her alone in the cafeteria, so he had paused for a moment and watched her. He understood that she was feeling lonely and without a purpose because of Unit 02 being so badly damaged, but she looked completely pathetic sitting there and playing with her food. Maybe a part of Shinji laughed at that, amused that she could be hurt over something so stupid. But it wasn't stupid to her.  
他知道明日香想对他说些什么，他对自己几分钟前的行为感到些许后悔，但不幸的是，当他看到她独自一人在食堂时，他无法控制自己，于是停下脚步，注视着她。他明白，由于二号机严重受损，她感到孤独且无所适从，但她坐在那里玩弄食物的样子实在可怜。或许真嗣内心的一部分对此感到好笑，觉得她会因为这么愚蠢的事情受伤很可笑。但对明日香来说，这并不愚蠢。

'Of course not,' replied the most human part of his mind. 'Being an Eva pilot was everything to her. Everything until-'  
'当然不，'他内心最人性化的一部分回答道，'成为 EVA 驾驶员曾是她的全部。直到——'

"I showed up in her life," Shinji whispered quietly. At the same time, the human voice inside him disappeared and he thought he felt Asuka shift uncomfortably behind him.  
“我出现在她的生活中，”真嗣轻声自语。与此同时，他内心的人声消失了，他感觉到身后的明日香不安地动了动。

"Why are you following me?" he finally asked, addressing the person behind him.  
“你为什么跟着我？”他终于问道，对着身后的人。

Shinji didn't need to turn around or have an AT-field to know that Asuka sneered at him.  
真嗣不需要转身或展开 AT 力场就知道明日香在对他嗤之以鼻。

"And who was the one that watched me while I was in the cafeteria?" said Asuka, trying to keep her voice at a normal volume...for now.  
“是谁在食堂里盯着我看的？”明日香说道，试图保持正常的音量……目前如此。

"I have no idea what you are talking about," lied Shinji as he turned to look over his shoulder. "Most likely you are imagining things."  
"我完全不知道你在说什么，" 真嗣撒谎道，同时转过头去看向身后。"很可能你是在胡思乱想。"

Asuka flinched openly at that and unclenched and then re-clenched her fists as though she longed she punch his stupid face in.  
听到这话，明日香明显地退缩了一下，然后松开又紧握拳头，仿佛渴望一拳打在他那愚蠢的脸上。

"Ha, idiot!" laughed Asuka as she crossed her arms over her chest. "You are the one thats imagining things. The commander has an AT-field? You're the son of an angel? Don't give me that bullshit."  
"哈，白痴！" 明日香笑着交叉双臂抱在胸前。"你才是那个在胡思乱想的人。指挥官有 AT 力场？你是天使的儿子？别跟我扯这些鬼话。"

Asuka wasn't sure whether she believed it or not, but she really didn't care much either way. Shinji however seemed too, because he turned all the way around and faced her.  
明日香不确定自己是否相信，但她真的对此并不太在意。然而，真嗣似乎很在意，因为他完全转过身来面对着她。

"So what you're saying is you don't believe me?" asked Shinji in a completely normal tone of voice.  
“所以你的意思是，你不相信我？”真嗣用一种完全正常的语气问道。

"Essentially...yes." “基本上……是的。”

"I see..." mumbled Shinji, as he slowly took his right hand out of his pocket and let it dangle limply at his side. Asuka meanwhile followed his hand with her eyes as he lowered it to his side.  
"我明白了..." 真嗣喃喃自语，缓缓地将右手从口袋里抽出，无力地垂在身侧。与此同时，明日香则目不转睛地盯着他的手，看着它慢慢垂下。

"Even after earlier...you don't believe me? Even though Misato believes me? Even if what I told you before to not associated with me still applies...more than ever for that matter."  
"即使是在之前的事情之后...你还是不相信我吗？即使美里相信我？即使我之前告诉过你不要和我扯上关系的话依然有效...甚至比以前更甚。"

"So what! For starters we are both Eva pilots."  
"那又怎样！首先，我们都是 EVA 驾驶员。"

"I don't think that applies to you anymore," replied Shinji coldly.  
"我认为那已经不再适用于你了，" 真嗣冷冷地回答道。

Asuka clenched her teeth at that, but her eyes still trailed to his right hand.  
听到这话，明日香咬紧了牙关，但她的目光仍不由自主地飘向他的右手。

"You're the one that appeared before me in the first place! You're the one that destroyed my Unit 02. You're the one that ruined everything! If it wasn't for you...I wouldn't be like this!" Asuka screamed at him.  
"是你先出现在我面前的！是你毁了我的二号机。是你毁了一切！如果不是因为你...我不会变成这样！" 明日香对他尖叫道。

Shinji looked back at her cooly and said, "Do I look like I care about your problems? In case you didn't realize, I have my own problems!"  
真嗣冷冷地回头看着她，说道：“我看起来像是关心你的问题吗？你没意识到吗，我自己也有一堆问题！”

Asuka took a step backwards from him then. Couldn't he understand what she was feeling right now?  
明日香从他身边退后一步。难道他就不明白她此刻的感受吗？

"You don't...but you-" “你不……但你——”

"I what?" asked Shinji snappishly.  
"我什么？" 真嗣不耐烦地问道。

Asuka bit down on her lower lip. A far corner of her mind still thought that he had something to do with her forgotten memories, but because of his personality, she wasn't able to bring the subject up. She didn't even fully understand the feeling herself, but she felt even lower than when she had been sitting alone in the cafeteria.  
明日香咬了咬下唇。她内心深处仍认为他与她遗忘的记忆有关，但由于他的性格，她无法提起这个话题。她甚至不完全理解自己的感受，但她觉得自己比独自坐在自助餐厅时还要低落。

Shinji however thought that he may have gone a step to far. What he had said wasn't necessarily true.  
然而，真嗣认为他可能做得有些过火了。他所说的话未必是真的。

Turning away from her, he sighed and said, "I told you I was sorry about Unit 02..."  
他转身背对她，叹了口气说：“我告诉过你，我对 02 号机的事很抱歉……”

"But its not like you cared one way or another," retorted Asuka with an empty voice.  
“但你根本不在乎，不是吗？”明日香用空洞的声音反驳道。

Again, this wasn't true, but there was no way Shinji was about to brooch the subject of Asuka's mother. That would lead to a number of awkward questions.  
这再次并非事实，但真嗣绝不会贸然提及明日香的母亲。那会引发一系列尴尬的问题。

"I can understand the connection between an Eva and its pilot. I did not want to damage it at all, but truth be, Unit 02 was rather...overbearing. Stubborn you could say."  
"我能理解 Eva 与其驾驶员之间的联系。我根本不想损坏它，但说实话，二号机相当...强势。可以说是固执。"

'Like yourself,' finished Shinji in his own mind.  
'就像你自己一样。' 真嗣在心里默默地补充道。

Asuka was silent for a moment before she asked, "I thought that the angel...Kaoru was controlling my Unit 02? Why would it be so...difficult..."  
明日香沉默了一会儿，然后问道："我以为那个天使...薰在控制我的二号机？为什么会这么...困难..."

"True," said Shinji while shrugging, "but Kaoru only had control over it a certain amount of time...afterwards Unit 02 started...acting on its own." Pausing for a minute, he turned back to her and looked her in the eye saying, "I think that Unit 02 was...protecting you in some way."  
“真的，” 真嗣耸耸肩说，“但 Kaoru 只能控制它一段时间……之后 02 号机就开始……自行行动了。”他停顿了一下，转头看着她，目光坚定地说，“我觉得 02 号机是在……以某种方式保护你。”

Asuka blinked several times back at him before she asked, "How could my Unit 02 be trying to protect me when I wasn't even in it?"  
明日香眨了几次眼，然后问道：“我不在里面的时候，我的 02 号机怎么可能试图保护我呢？”

"No clue," replied Shinji. "Why don't you ask it that?" he finished sarcastically with a slight sneer. This brought Asuka quickly back to the fact that she wanted to punch his stupid face into jelly.  
“不知道，” 真嗣回答。“你为什么不问问它呢？”他略带嘲讽地补充道，嘴角微微上扬。这让明日香迅速回想起她想把他的蠢脸打成肉酱的冲动。

"Tch, idiot!" she replied feeling annoyed as she turned her head the other way. Though as she peeked out of one of her eyes she saw that he had already walked ten feet away from her.  
"哼，白痴！" 她不悦地回应，将头转向另一边。然而，当她从一只眼睛偷偷望出去时，发现他已经走出了十英尺远。

"Ahhh...where are you going!" she yelled fervently.  
"啊啊啊...你要去哪儿！" 她急切地喊道。

"No clue, but where ever it is, I don't want you following me to it."  
"不知道，但无论去哪儿，我都不希望你跟着我。"

"As if I would moron!"  
"我才不会那么傻！"

Shinji however didn't seem to have anything further to say to her, and continued walking down the hallway. Asuka however was determinedly trying not to watch him, and failing miserably. Eventually uncrossing her arms, she stared after him for a few moments before she took one small step forward as Shinji yelled behind him.  
然而，真嗣似乎对她没什么更多的话要说，继续沿着走廊走下去。明日香则坚决地试图不去看他，却失败得一塌糊涂。最终她放下了交叉的双臂，盯着他的背影看了几秒钟，然后向前迈了一小步，与此同时，真嗣在前面大喊。

"I thought I told you not to me follow me!"  
"我记得我告诉过你别跟着我！"

"I'm perfectly inclined to walk anywhere I damn well please!" replied Asuka hotly.  
"我完全乐意走到我他妈想去的地方！" 明日香激烈地回应道。

Shinji turned around and glared at her, hoping that his gaze could break the arrogance and stubbornness inside of her. Asuka glared back with about as much intensity. Reluctantly, Shinji was the first to break his glare.  
真嗣转过身来，瞪着她，希望他的目光能击碎她内心的傲慢与固执。明日香同样以强烈的目光回瞪。不情愿地，真嗣首先移开了视线。

"Fine, do whatever you want."  
"好吧，随你便。"

"Okay then, do you know anything about my lost memories?"  
“那么，你知道关于我失去的记忆的任何事情吗？”

The words were out of Asuka's mouth before she even managed to wrap them around her tongue. Realizing what she just said, she quickly covered her mouth with her hand and repeated over and over in her mind, 'What the fuck did I just do?'  
话还没在嘴里绕清楚，就已经从明日香嘴里蹦了出来。意识到自己刚刚说了什么，她迅速用手捂住嘴，在心里一遍遍地问自己，‘我他妈刚才做了什么？’

Even so though, she waited with bated breath for Shinji's reply.  
尽管如此，她还是屏息以待，等待着真嗣的回答。

Shinji meanwhile felt a very unpleasant chill travel up is spine at her words. He knew Asuka was sharp, but this...he never expected something like this. First and foremost: how could she remember anything in the first place, and second: could she remember anything specifically?  
与此同时，真嗣听到她的话后感到一股极其不快的寒意沿着脊背上升。他知道明日香很敏锐，但这次……他从未预料到这样的事情。首先：她怎么可能记得任何事情，其次：她能记得具体什么内容呢？

Feigning ignorance, he said, "I've no idea what you're talking abou-"  
他假装无知地说：“我不知道你在说什么——”

"Don't lie like Misato and the others," said Asuka, cutting him off. "I'm sick of being lied to..."  
“别像美里和其他人那样撒谎，”明日香打断了他，“我受够了被欺骗……”

"I've really no idea what you're talking abou-"  
"我真的不知道你在说什么-"

Next second, an angry demon was in Shinji's face, and yelling at him. Asuka had taken several quick strides towards him and without thinking, started shouting at him.  
下一秒，一个愤怒的恶魔出现在真嗣面前，对他大吼大叫。明日香快步走向他，不假思索地开始对他大喊。

"You have no idea what you're talking about! Really! Because every single fucking person besides me seems to know whats going on! What the fuck happened while I was hospitalized? Did the First grow a personality? Did my bastard of a father show up? Did Misato get wasted and end up in an orgy! I want to know why everyone is keeping something from me! And you! I want to know what you have to do with it all!"  
"你根本不知道你在说什么！真的！因为除了我之外，每个人似乎都知道发生了什么！我住院期间到底发生了什么？初号机长出个性了吗？我那混蛋父亲出现了吗？美里喝醉了然后参加了一场狂欢吗！我想知道为什么每个人都在对我隐瞒什么！还有你！我想知道你和这一切有什么关系！"

"What the hell do I have to do with your fucked up mind!" shouted Shinji with equal volume back at her face.  
“我他妈的跟你那该死的脑子有什么关系！” 真嗣同样大声地朝她吼回去。

Asuka, already reaching a breaking point emotionally, grabbed Shinji by the scruff of his shirt and threw him against the sheet-rocked wall, and continued yelling at him, bits of spittle flying out of her mouth and landing on his face.  
情绪已经濒临崩溃的明日香，一把抓住真嗣的衣领，将他甩向石膏板墙，继续对他大喊大叫，唾沫星子飞溅，落在他的脸上。

"I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WITH MY MEMORIES DAMN IT! BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR STUPID FUCKING FACE! AND THERE WAS THAT FRIED RICE YOU MADE...AND...AND THAT FUCKING CASE THAT I CAN'T EVEN GO TO SLEEP WITHOUT HOLDING!"  
“我他妈的不知道你跟我的记忆有什么关系！但就是关于你那愚蠢至极的脸！还有你做的那盘炒饭……还有……还有那个该死的箱子，没有它我根本睡不着！”

If there was ever a moment for Shinji to have an aneurism...it was then. How the hell could he have forgotten about something so memorable as that particular item? He should have thrown it away like everything that had been in his room. Thankfully though, the blankness of his brain didn't seem to show on his face.  
如果真有哪个时刻能让真嗣突发脑溢血的话...那就是现在了。他怎么可能忘记那样一件令人难忘的东西？他本该像房间里其他所有东西一样把它扔掉的。不过幸运的是，他大脑的空白似乎并没有显露在脸上。

Looking back at her passively for a minute, he said, "As much as I enjoy listening to the drabber of a fifteen year old, I really don't care about that stuff."  
他平静地看了她一会儿，说道：“虽然我很享受听一个十五岁少女的唠叨，但我真的不在乎那些东西。”

Asuka couldn't take anymore, and let get of his shirt, before swinging her right fist forward and striking him across the bridge of his noes.  
明日香再也忍受不了了，她松开他的衬衫，挥出右拳，狠狠地打在他的鼻梁上。

Whether she intended to apply that much force, it certainly reached the desired effect. The bridge of Shinji's nose bent in an odd angle as Asuka's fist made contact with it. Blood spurted out of both his nostrils, while Asuka felt the sensation of bone breaking. Since Shinji was backed up against a wall, his head smashed backwards into the hard wall, though leaving a sizable dent where is head had hit it. A blood lump appeared just at the back of his head.  
无论她是否打算施加如此大的力量，效果确实达到了预期。当明日香的拳头击中真嗣的鼻梁时，他的鼻梁以一种奇怪的角度弯曲了。鲜血从他的两个鼻孔中喷涌而出，而明日香则感受到了骨头断裂的感觉。由于真嗣被逼到了墙边，他的头猛地向后撞在坚硬的墙上，尽管在他头部撞击的地方留下了一个相当大的凹痕。他的后脑勺上立刻出现了一个血肿。

Momentarily stunned at what she had done, Asuka regained control of herself, and drew back to hit him again, when Shinji grabbed her fist as it swung forward.  
短暂地被自己的行为震惊，明日香恢复了控制，正要再次挥拳打他时，真嗣抓住了她向前挥动的拳头。

"LET GO OF ME YOU BASTARD," Asuka shrieked at him.  
“放开我，你这个混蛋，”明日香对他尖叫道。

Shinji simply stared back at her as blood dripped down his face, pausing at the corners of his lips before staining his white shirt.  
真嗣只是回望着她，鲜血顺着脸颊滴落，在唇角稍作停留后染红了他的白衬衫。

"I SAID LET GO OF ME YOU BASTARD," Asuka repeated herself.  
“我说了放开我，你这个混蛋，”明日香再次重复道。

Shinji did just that. 真嗣就这么做了。

But he also push her forward slightly so that Asuka fell backwards a few steps.  
但他也轻轻推了她一下，使得明日香向后退了几步。

"WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU-"  
“你在干什么你——”

Shinji's right hand came slicing downwards through the air, tearing the wind apart and effectively cutting Asuka off mid sentence. His AT-field came mere centimeters from slicing off Asuka's right arm. His AT-field slice in the wall, destroying the sheet-rock and sending white ponder into the air. Thankfully enough, there was no office or other room on the other side of the room, but Shinji had purposefully controlled it so it didn't travel far. A large crack travelled up the wall where Shinji's AT-field had hit and along the ceiling before large chunks of the wall fell in the hallway where the were standing. Electric circuits fell from the ceiling where they had been placed and now hung into the hallway as though they were fines.  
真嗣的右手猛地向下划过空气，撕裂了风声，有效地打断了明日香的话。他的 AT 力场距离切断明日香的右臂仅差几厘米。他的 AT 力场在墙上划过，破坏了石膏板，扬起一片白色粉尘。幸运的是，墙的另一边没有办公室或其他房间，但真嗣有意控制了力道，使其没有飞得太远。一道巨大的裂缝沿着真嗣的 AT 力场击中的地方向上延伸至天花板，随后大块的墙体坍塌在他们站立的走廊上。原本安装在天花板上的电路现在像细丝一样悬挂在走廊中。

Shinji continued his silence, with his right arm halfway at his side. He simply continued staring at Asuka, waiting for her reaction.  
真嗣继续保持沉默，右臂半垂在身侧。他只是继续盯着明日香，等待她的反应。

Asuka's entire body seemed to have seized up. A cold sweat developed all over her body, instantly lowering her body temperature and sending a cold shiver down her spine. Her bottom lip trembled with fright while her eyes remained as wide as dinner place. The last bit of her words before he had used his AT-field seemed to have been caught in her throat, but she wasn't able to say them...not now, not ever. Lastly, her eyes trailed on a lock of bright red hair that seemed to be floating through the air as if a breeze had entered the hallway. Shinji had sliced off a lock of her hair as he had shoved her backwards.  
明日香整个人似乎都僵住了。冷汗遍布全身，瞬间降低了体温，让她脊背发凉。她的下唇因恐惧而颤抖，眼睛瞪得像餐盘一样大。在他使用 AT 力场之前，她最后的话似乎卡在了喉咙里，但她无法说出来……现在不行，永远都不行。最后，她的目光落在了一缕似乎随风飘扬的鲜红发丝上。真嗣在将她推开时，削下了一缕她的头发。

"Now do you see what I mean," said Shinji in a low voice. Asuka looked back into his blood red eyes and saw cold contempt. She unconsciously took a step back.  
“现在你明白我的意思了吧，”真嗣低声说道。明日香回望他那血红色的眼睛，看到了冰冷的蔑视。她不由自主地后退了一步。

Continuing, Shinji said, "I don't care about what you're problems, I don't care about your stupid memories, and I certainly don't care to listen to the sniveling sorrows of somebody unfit to even pilot Eva."  
真嗣继续说道：“我不在乎你的问题，不在乎你那些愚蠢的记忆，更不想听一个连驾驶 EVA 都不配的人的哀怨。”

Shinji smiled slightly at his own words. He had hit the nail on the head in a sense.  
真嗣对他的话微微一笑。在某种意义上，他确实说到了点子上。

Shinji's words froze the already frost bitten Asuka's heart.  
真嗣的话让本已心寒的明日香更加冰冷。

"Furthermore, I could have instantly killed you, but I believed that scaring you would be a better solution. I don't like the sight of blood and probably you don't either. This is a proper trade. Don't associate with me anymore. I have my own things to worry about as it is."  
“再者，我本可以立刻杀了你，但我相信吓唬你才是更好的办法。我不喜欢看到血，可能你也不喜欢。这是公平的交易。别再和我扯上关系了。我自己的事情已经够烦的了。”

As Shinji turned away from her, Asuka caught a glimpse of Shinji's face, and saw that his noes had snapped itself back into its rightful place. Her legs started to loose there strength. How could he have done such a thing?  
当真嗣转身离开她时，明日香瞥见了真嗣的脸，发现他的鼻子已经自行恢复到了正确的位置。她的双腿开始失去力量。他怎么能做出这样的事？

As Shinji continued walking away, he turned one last time and said, "I never thought the high and mighty Asuka would ever look so pitiful."  
当真嗣继续走开时，他最后回头一次说：“我从没想过高高在上的明日香会有这么可怜的样子。”

Asuka's head jerked at his comment. The way he said her name so casually...she felt a cold rage building up inside of her. Willing her legs to stay upright for a little while longer, she shouted back at him while trying to keep the sob in her voice at a minimum and the tears from spilling forth from her eyes.  
明日香听到他的话，头猛地一震。他如此随意地叫她的名字...她感到一股冰冷的怒火在内心升起。她努力让双腿保持直立，尽量抑制住声音中的哽咽，不让泪水从眼中涌出，对着他大喊。

"I...hate you...bastard!" I thought because you were different...that you could maybe at least understand. But you're...not even a human anymore. So how could you ever understand... I hate you..."  
"我...恨你...混蛋！" 我以为你与众不同...或许至少能理解我。但你...已经不再是人类了。你又怎能理解...我恨你..."

Shinji paused for a second, forcing himself to not looked back at her. Every fiber in his body was screaming at him right now, but he would rather destroy his own mind then have to look at Asuka right now.  
真嗣停顿了一下，强迫自己不要回头看她。此刻他身体的每一根神经都在尖叫，但他宁愿摧毁自己的心智，也不愿现在面对明日香。

Whispering quietly, so that she wouldn't hear him, he said, "Good...because if we ever were to reach an understanding between each other...again...I believe that both of us will die. At least this way...you'll survive."  
他轻声细语，确保她听不见，说道："这样...也好...因为如果我们再次试图相互理解...我想我们俩都会死去。至少这样...你能活下去。"

Shinji continued walking forward, as everything inside of him threaten to spill forth. He knew he had done more damage then he had meant to, but he didn't care anymore. It was better this way; better for her to hate him and curse him then to try to become closer. If he was perfectly honest with himself, he wanted nothing more to embrace her right now, even if it meant that he would be on his knees with severe pain in his groin, but the possibility of that had disappeared. He couldn't see himself in Asuka's future anymore.  
真嗣继续向前走，内心的一切似乎都要爆发出来。他知道自己造成的伤害比原本打算的更多，但他已经不在乎了。这样更好；她恨他、诅咒他，总比试图更亲近要好。如果他对自己完全诚实，他现在最想做的就是拥抱她，即使这意味着他会痛苦地跪在地上，但那种可能性已经消失了。他再也看不到自己在明日香的未来里了。

'And it hurts,' he thought before he disappeared out of her sight.  
“而且这很痛，”他想，然后消失在她的视线之外。

Asuka's finally collapsed under her own weight as Shinji rounded the corner and sank to the ground. Placing her head over her knees she wept silently in the hallway. She had thought he knew something, even hoped on it, but the reality was that he didn't care about her one way or another. Even if he did know something, he would never tell it to her. Asuka wept not so much because she would never remember her past life, but because Shinji had ignored her cry out for help; him who should understand her the best.  
当真嗣转过拐角并瘫坐在地上时，明日香终于支撑不住自己的重量，倒下了。她把头埋在膝盖上，在走廊里无声地哭泣。她曾以为他知道些什么，甚至对此抱有希望，但现实是他对她毫不在意。即使他真的知道什么，也绝不会告诉她。明日香哭泣并非因为她永远无法记起前世，而是因为真嗣忽视了她的求救；那个本应最理解她的人。

She hated him, but she wished that she could have known him. Now though, it seemed like nothing more than a disappearing dream.  
她恨他，却又希望自己能了解他。如今看来，这一切不过是一场即将消逝的梦。

What she didn't understand thought was what he had said at the end. The majority of it she didn't catch, and she sorta thought he never wished her to here it; that was why he said it so quietly.  
她不明白的是他最后说的话。大部分内容她没听清，她觉得他并不希望她听到；所以他说得那么轻。

"Why did he say, 'at least this way you will survive?'"  
“他为什么要说，‘至少这样你能活下去’？”

Asuka had heard that last of Shinji's whispered words.  
明日香听到了真嗣最后那句低语。

Continuing to stare at her keens while her tear stained face started to dry up, she pondered his mumbled words, but she couldn't figure out what it had meant.  
她继续盯着她的刀刃，泪痕未干的脸庞开始干燥，她思索着他的含糊话语，却无法理解其含义。

"Stupid idiot," she mumbled, "Why the hell did you say something like that."  
“笨蛋，”她喃喃自语，“你到底为什么要那样说。”

Looking towards the corner where he had disappeared around, she was tempted to follow after him, but something held her back. Was she honestly scared of him? Maybe scared yes, but she never thought that he would have actually killed her. He said he hated the sight of blood, so it was reasonable to assume that he would not have killed her.  
她望向他消失的角落，心中涌起跟随的冲动，但某种力量阻止了她。她真的害怕他吗？或许是有一点，但她从未想过他会真的杀了她。他说过他讨厌看到血，所以可以合理推测他不会杀她。

"So then why did he do what he did? Why did he try to make me avoid him?" she wondered out loud.  
“那么，他为什么要那样做？为什么试图让我避开他？”她大声自问。

But only one thing came to mind, and that was that he knew something about her memories.  
但脑海中只浮现一个念头，那就是他知道一些关于她记忆的事情。

"Stupid bastard," she swore.  
"愚蠢的混蛋，" 她咒骂道。

Forcing herself to stand up, she wiped the remaining tears off her face with the back of her left hand.  
她强迫自己站起来，用左手背擦去脸上残留的泪水。

"I don't care how long it takes," she said, "I swear I'll beat my memories out of you even if I have to break a two by four over your head."  
"我不在乎要花多长时间，" 她说，"我发誓我会把你从我的记忆中打出来，哪怕我得用两根四英寸的木板敲你的头。"

Taking one last look down the hallway at the corner where he had disappeared around she sighed and said, "Stubborn as," before walking the opposite way.  
她最后瞥了一眼他消失的转角，叹了口气，喃喃道：“固执得像……”，然后朝相反的方向走去。

Asuka didn't really realize, but she was being just as selfish and self-centered as Shinji was.  
明日香并没有意识到，她其实和真嗣一样自私和以自我为中心。

---

Twelve people sat around a large oaken table. Each of them was an old man in his late eighties.  
十二个人围坐在一张大橡木桌旁。他们每个人都是年近九旬的老人。

The oldest of the twelve spoke first.  
十二人中最年长的先开了口。

"The last angel Tabris has been defeated by the child of Adam. The appointed time is upon us."  
“最后的使徒 Tabris 已被亚当之子击败。指定之时已至。”

"But what about Gendo and his plans?" said the man next to him.  
“那 Gendo 和他的计划怎么办？”他身旁的男人问道。

"Let the fool think what he will," said a man on the opposite side of the table. "The Eva series is completed, and the JSDF only need to be bought."  
"让那傻瓜怎么想就怎么想吧，"桌子对面的一位男士说道，"EVA 系列已经完成，自卫队只需被收买即可。"

"But what of the child of Adam? Surely he will not listen to us."  
"但亚当之子呢？他肯定不会听我们的。"

"He will not have a choice in the matter. His destiny was appointed at birth. The Spawn of Adam will pave the way for the future that we the chosen people of Seele have decreed. There will be no mistakes in the matter."  
"在这件事上，他没有选择的余地。他的命运从出生起就已注定。亚当之子将为我们选定的 Seele 一族铺平未来的道路。此事绝不会有差错。"

"What of Lilith then," one the men asked after a short pause.  
“那么莉莉丝呢，”一人短暂停顿后问道。

The oldest of the them smiled slightly as he said, "Lilith will always do what is best for the humans, for us. She will not hinder are plans."  
他们中最年长者微微一笑，说道：“莉莉丝总是会为人类，为我们，做最好的选择。她不会阻碍我们的计划。”

Some of the other men were rather skeptical at this, but didn't voice there opinion. The Dead Sea Scrolls held by the number one were an absolute.  
其他一些人对此颇为怀疑，但没有表达自己的意见。那卷由一号持有的死海古卷是绝对的。

"In three days time we assault the stronghold Tokyo-3 and destroy the Geofront."  
"三天后，我们将进攻第三新东京市，摧毁地底都市。"

"What of the surrounding civilians and personal of Nerv though?" as one of the men at the corner of the table.  
"那周边的平民和 NERV 的员工怎么办？" 桌角的一名男子问道。"

Seeming to shrug slightly, the oldest of them said, "Leave none alive."  
似乎微微耸了耸肩，其中最年长的一位说："一个不留。"

### Chapter 28: Goodbyes

**Well finally got this one done. It took a lot longer than i expected because I had a hard drive failure...meaning I lost the original draft of this and had to start from scratch...along with the other 60GB of stuff I had. So things are moving slow right now. I gotta redownload all my Evangelion stuff, and trust me, its a lot.  
终于完成了这一章。比预期的花费了更长时间，因为我遭遇了硬盘故障...这意味着我失去了这一章的原始草稿，不得不从头开始...还有其他 60GB 的资料。所以现在进度很慢。我得重新下载所有《新世纪福音战士》的资料，相信我，这可不少。**

**Not sure if I'll manage to get another chapter posted before college starts, but lets see...  
不确定在大学开学前能否再发布一章，但让我们拭目以待...**

The third day since the last angel Tabris died.  
自天使塔布里斯逝去的第三天。

The third day since Shinji discovered he was the child of the being known as Adam.  
自真嗣发现自己是被称为亚当的存在之子的第三天。

The third day since the conference of Seele, in which the number one gave the order that no man, woman, or child would be left alive in Tokyo-3.  
自 Seele 会议的第三天，在那次会议上，一号下达了命令，东京-3 内不留任何男女老幼的活口。

The third day, the ending of the old age, and the beginning of a new….  
第三天，旧时代的终结，新时代的开始……

---

"Damn it, I almost wished that they would hurry up and attack," mumbled Shinji as he threw the stone from his hand into the lake.  
“该死，我几乎希望他们快点进攻，”真嗣喃喃自语，将手中的石头扔进湖中。

Since those three days prior, Shinji had spent little time around anyone else, which suited him just fine. He had briefly talked to Fuyutsuki about where he would be when Seele attacked, but Fuyutsuki had told him they'd discuss it at a different time. Instead, he had given Shinji a cell phone which would automatically have a text sent to it if they needed him at the command center. During there discussion, he had been rather tempted to ask about that bastard, but figured he wouldn't get an answer either way. He had talked to Misato though, but that wasn't really worth mentioning.  
自从三天前开始，真嗣几乎没有和其他人相处，这对他来说正合适。他曾短暂地与冬月谈论过 Seele 攻击时他会在哪里，但冬月告诉他会在不同的时间讨论。相反，他给了真嗣一部手机，如果需要他在指挥中心，就会自动发送短信给他。在讨论期间，他很想问那个混蛋的事，但觉得无论怎样都不会得到答案。他倒是和美里谈过，但那不值一提。

Bending down, he chose another smooth stone among the many littering the shores of the man made lake inside the Geofront and picked it up. Turning it several times in his hands, he smirked slightly as he threw it outward like a Frisbee, making it skip several times across the water before it finally sunk.  
他弯下腰，在 Geofront 内人工湖岸边散落的众多平滑石子中挑选了一颗，拾了起来。在手中翻转了几下，他微微一笑，将石子像飞盘一样抛出，让它在水面上跳跃了几次后才最终沉没。

"All this waiting is making me impatient," he said, finishing his earlier thought.  
“这样等待让我有些不耐烦了，”他说着，结束了之前的思绪。

Picking up another stone, he threw it with his left hand, while simultaneously slicing his right arm through the air. His AT-field shot outwards, cleanly slicing the stone in half so it that it dropped into the water with a plunk. Feeling somewhat satisfied, he threw his arms behind his head and turned around to walk back up the embankment he had slid down to get to the shore. As he did this though, he descried the elevator far off in the distance where he had talked with Kaoru those few days ago. It all seemed like a distant memory now.  
他又捡起一块石头，用左手抛出，同时右手在空中划过。他的 AT 力场随之向外扩散，干净利落地将石子一分为二，使其落入水中发出扑通声。感到些许满意，他将双臂枕在脑后，转身走回他滑下的堤岸。然而，就在这时，他远远地看到了几天前与薰交谈过的电梯，这一切现在似乎都成了遥远的记忆。

Reaching the top of the embankment he turned and looked at the giant pyramid like structure in the middle of the Geofront. The headquarters of Nerv seemed so impenetrable and formidable, but Shinji knew otherwise. They could not live long against a siege, which he wouldn't be surprised if that actually happened. After all, it had never been created with the intention of fighting other humans.  
他爬上堤坝顶端，转身望向位于地底都市中央的巨大金字塔状结构。NERV 总部看似坚不可摧、威严凛然，但真嗣知道事实并非如此。他们无法在长期围困中生存，如果这真的发生，他也不会感到惊讶。毕竟，它从未被设计用来对抗其他人类。

Walking down the paved walkway that circled around the Geofront, he kicked randomly and several stones he had seen of his earlier walks. He had spent most of his time walking around the Geofront, but he was strictly forbidden from entering Tokyo-3 for obvious reasons. It had come to the point now, that when he walked; he was able to recognize cracks in the asphalt that he had seen at earlier times.  
他沿着环绕地底都市的铺砌小径走下去，随意踢了几颗之前散步时注意到的石头。他大部分时间都在地底都市周围散步，但出于显而易见的原因，他被严格禁止进入第三新东京市。如今，当他行走时，他能认出以前见过的柏油路面上的裂缝。

It was almost as though he was thinking these things, so as to not let his mind stray to other matters. But unfortunately they seemed to be.  
这几乎就像是他故意在思考这些事情，以免思绪飘向其他问题。但不幸的是，这些思绪似乎总是不请自来。

He hadn't talked to Asuka once since he had essentially rejected her those three days ago. Though they saw each other often enough in the hallways, Asuka acted as though Shinji was part of the wall, which Shinji was perfectly fine with. Misato was supervising much of the defense that would be in place to stop Seele, so Asuka was stuck at Nerv almost as frequently as Shinji was. But if Asuka ignored him, then he would reply the exact same.  
自从三天前他实质上拒绝了明日香之后，他一次也没和她说过话。尽管他们在走廊里经常碰面，明日香却表现得好像真嗣是墙壁的一部分，对此真嗣完全没意见。美里负责监督大部分防御措施，以阻止 Seele，因此明日香几乎和真嗣一样频繁地被困在 Nerv。但如果明日香无视他，那么他也会以同样的方式回应。

Shinji couldn't forget what he had said to Asuka, nor could he forget the desperation that she had shown on her face, as though he was the last person that she had expected…believed. It hurt Shinji to do what he did, but it was better this way. He hated Asuka, so that he could protect her. He didn't want to see her hurt anymore. What he had not expected though, was for Asuka to ask him about her memories.  
真嗣无法忘记他对明日香说的话，也无法忘记她脸上流露出的绝望，仿佛他是她最没预料到……相信的人。真嗣这样做很痛苦，但这样更好。他恨明日香，这样他才能保护她。他不想再看到她受伤了。然而，他没料到的是，明日香会向他询问她的记忆。

He had always known that Asuka was exceptionally bright, even if she didn't show it often, and that he was comparatively dumb, but what she said threw him for a loop. He had never in his craziest dreams thought that she would ask such a thing. But she had, and for a brief instance, he had wondered whether some portion of her memories remained intact. What she said about the earrings he had given her though…he had honestly completely forgotten about those. When he had thrown all his stuff out when he ceased to live in Misato's apartment, he should have thrown those out along with the rest of his things. But it wasn't just that, small things seemed to trigger memories about the times they spent together.  
他一直知道明日香异常聪明，即便她不常显露，而相比之下自己则显得愚钝，但她的话还是让他大吃一惊。他做梦也想不到她会提出这样的要求。然而她确实提了，有那么一瞬间，他怀疑她是否还保留着部分记忆。至于她提到的他送给她的耳环……他真的完全忘记了。当他不再住在美里公寓，把所有东西都扔掉时，他本该把那些耳环也一起丢掉的。但不仅仅是耳环，似乎许多小事都能勾起他们共度时光的回忆。

Shinji also supposed though that it wasn't just his fault that Asuka seemed in such a bad mood. The report on her Unit 02 had come back, and it hadn't been pretty. Though the right arm had been repaired, it was only possible because they neglected the other damaged areas of Unit 02. Because of that, it was impossible to consider it battle ready…no matter how much Asuka screamed and yelled at the technicians in both German and Japanese. Instead, both Asuka and Rei would be kept at a secure underground bunker deep inside Terminal Dogma.  
真嗣也认为，并非只是他的错导致了明日香情绪如此糟糕。关于她的二号机的报告已经出来了，结果并不乐观。尽管右臂得到了修复，但这只是因为他们忽视了二号机其他受损区域的结果。因此，无法将其视为具备战斗能力……无论明日香如何用德语和日语对技术人员大喊大叫。相反，明日香和绫波将被安置在终端教条深处的一个安全地下掩体中。

The Evangelion pilots would be targeted first; everyone knew this, which was why Misato had decided on a possible escape plan. During the creation of the Geofront, many tunnels had been delved underneath the mountains surrounding Tokyo-3. With these tunnels a group of guards had been given the task of escorting Asuka and Rei to The United States. It seemed to be the only safe passage for now, since it seemed likely that other nations would partake in the attack.  
福音战士驾驶员将是首要目标；这一点众所周知，这也是为何美里决定制定一个可能的逃生计划。在创建 Geofront 时，东京-3 周围的山脉下挖掘了许多隧道。利用这些隧道，一组警卫被赋予了护送明日香和绫波前往美国的任务。目前看来，这是唯一的安​​全通道，因为其他国家参与攻击的可能性很大。

Shinji though, on the other hand, had no intentions of running away.  
然而，真嗣却无意逃跑。

"It's not my place to do such a thing," muttered Shinji  
"这不是我该做的事，" 真嗣咕哝着

As he said this, he felt a vibration in his pocket. Reaching into it, he pulled out the cell phone and read the text message displayed across the screen. Frowning slightly, he looked towards the large pyramid and thought, 'A chance to surrender?'  
就在他说这话时，他感觉到口袋里一阵震动。伸手进去，他掏出手机，阅读屏幕上显示的短信。微微皱眉，他望向那座巨大的金字塔，心想：'投降的机会？'

---

"Correct," answered Misato as Shinji asked his question.  
"没错，" 美里回答了真嗣的问题。

Shinji looked back at Misato with a surprised look on his face before he folded his arms and asked, "What exactly is this bullshit?"  
真嗣回头看着美里，脸上满是惊讶，随后他双臂交叉，问道：“这到底是什么鬼东西？”

"To be honest, we rather expected this," said Fuyutsuki as he turned away from the monitor displaying the entirety of Tokyo-3.  
“老实说，我们对此早有预料，”冬月说着，转身离开了显示整个第三新东京市的监视器。

Shinji had come to the commander center as he had been instructed to, but he didn't expect this. Looking around at the many faces inside the command center, he saw that most of the faces looked hopeful, as though they expected Fuyutsuki to accept the terms of surrender, whatever they may be. Shinji didn't think they had an inkling about how ruthless Seele was.  
真嗣按照指示来到了指挥中心，但他没想到会是这样。环顾指挥中心内的众多面孔，他发现大多数人都面带希望，仿佛他们期待着冬月接受投降条件，无论这些条件是什么。真嗣不认为他们了解 Seele 有多么冷酷无情。

"What do you mean you expected this?" asked Shinji  
“你这话是什么意思，你预料到了这个？” 真嗣问道

Fuyutsuki paused for a minute before he said, "Earlier today, the government of Japan issued a statement saying that the city known as Tokyo-3 was no longer part of their nation, and that it should be viewed hostilely, and that the Evangelions were a threat to mankind."  
冬月顿了一下，然后说道：“今天早些时候，日本政府发表声明称，那个被称为第三新东京市的地方已不再属于他们的国家，并应被视为敌对，同时指出 EVA 是对人类构成威胁的存在。”

Shinji blinked several times; this statement seemed like such a contradictions compared to three days ago.  
真嗣眨了几次眼；这个声明与他三天前的认知相比，显得如此矛盾。

"But they completely supported us three days ago," he said, speaking his thoughts.  
“但他们三天前还完全支持我们，”他说出了自己的想法。

"It just goes to show how much influence Seele has on the nation of Japan. But that's not all," said Misato. "We were right in assuming that other nations would partake in the attack, since each member of Seele is a well known person within their nation, some even within the cabinets of foreign nations. Many nations have given their support to Japan, including armed troops. The United Nations themselves sympathizes with the government of Japan, and fully supports them."  
“这足以显示 Seele 对日本国家的影响力有多大。但这还不是全部，”美里说，“我们正确地假设了其他国家也会参与攻击，因为 Seele 的每个成员在其国家内都是知名人士，有些甚至在其他国家内阁中。许多国家已经向日本提供了支持，包括武装部队。联合国本身也同情日本政府，并全力支持他们。”

"But the bad news doesn't stop there," continued Fuyutsuki. "The United States is no longer an option to send Asuka and Rei to."  
“但坏消息还不止这些，”继续说道副校长。“美国已不再是一个可以送明日香和绫波去的选择。”

It was then that Shinji realized that both Asuka and Rei were present in the command center. He was rather surprised that he had missed their faces earlier. Asuka was ignoring him as usual, but Rei was looking straight at him. Shinji tried to smile, but found that he couldn't force it no matter how hard he tried, but Rei didn't seem like she cared. Shinji then remembered what Ritsuko had told him before, and knew that Rei didn't even remember who he was anymore.  
就在那时，真嗣意识到明日香和丽都出现在指挥中心。他颇为惊讶自己之前竟然没注意到她们的脸。明日香一如既往地无视他，但丽却直直地看着他。真嗣试图微笑，却发现无论如何也挤不出来，但丽似乎并不在意。真嗣随即想起之前律子告诉他的话，知道丽已经不记得他是谁了。

Turning back to Fuyutsuki, he asked, "What happened with America?"  
他转头问冬月：“美国那边发生了什么？”

"We don't know what changed their minds so suddenly, but they have decided to back the efforts of many countries financially. The only plus is that they wont be sending armed troops."  
“我们不清楚他们为何突然改变主意，但他们决定在财政上支持许多国家的努力。唯一的好处是他们不会派遣武装部队。”

Shinji couldn't help but laugh inwardly at that.  
真嗣忍不住在心里暗笑。

"So now what?" he asked finally after Misato and Fuyutsuki were done talking. "Don't tell me that you plan to accept this surrender?"  
"那现在怎么办？" 在美里和冬月结束谈话后，他终于问道，"别告诉我你们打算接受这份投降？"

"Don't be absurd," scoffed Fuyutsuki in nothing like his usual manner. "They wouldn't give us a chance even if we did surrender. We have already given our answer, but they gave us an hour to rethink it."  
"别荒谬了，" 冬月嗤之以鼻，完全不像他平时的样子，"就算我们投降，他们也不会给我们机会。我们已经给出了答复，但他们给了我们一个小时重新考虑。"

As Fuyutsuki said this, Shinji looked around at the faces that had been full of hope minutes ago. They seemed depressed and dejected now.  
正如冬月所说，真嗣环顾四周，看着几分钟前还充满希望的面孔。现在他们似乎沮丧而失望。

"What about the mayor of Tokyo-3?" asked Shinji. "Didn't he comment on this whole thing?"  
“那东京-3 的市长呢？”真嗣问道，“他对此事没有发表评论吗？”

"It seems like the mayor has been in the pockets of Seele for a while now," said Misato. "He moved to Tokyo-2 yesterday."  
“看来市长已经被 Seele 控制很久了，”美里说，“他昨天搬到东京-2 去了。”

"Great…just great," muttered Shinji as he ran a hand through his hair. "And…so? Where exactly should I be?"  
"太好了……真是太好了，" 真嗣一边喃喃自语，一边用手梳理着头发。"那么……我应该在哪里呢？"

"…What do you mean Shinji?" asked Misato.  
"……你是什么意思，真嗣？" 美里问道。"

"For the defense! Won't they hit hardest at Gate 1?"  
"为了防御！他们不会在最靠近的 1 号门发起最猛烈的攻击吗？"

"Well, that is what we expect but-"  
"嗯，这是我们预期的，但是——"

"Great, then I'll go there now."  
"太好了，那我现在就去。"

As Shinji turned to leave though, Misato shouted after him.  
然而，当真嗣转身要离开时，美里在他身后喊道。

"Hold on Shinji! I have something else I want you to do first!"  
“等等，真嗣！我还有件事要你先做！”

Pausing for a minute in mid step, Shinji asked without turning around, "What is it?"  
真嗣在迈步中途停顿了一下，没有转身问道：“什么事？”

Misato hesitated for a second. She knew how against this Shinji would be, but she couldn't turn to anyone else.  
美里犹豫了一秒。她知道真嗣会多么反对这件事，但她别无选择。

"Shinji…I need you to escort both Rei and Asuka to the elevator that will take them into Terminal Dogma."  
"真嗣…我需要你护送绫波和明日香到电梯那里，它会带她们进入最终教条区。"

Shinji heard her words, but they didn't really register with him.  
真嗣听到了她的话，但这些话并没有真正在他心中留下印象。

"What did you say Misato?"  
"你说什么，美里？"

"…You heard exactly what I said Shinji," she replied simply without a hitch in her voice.  
"“…你确实听到了我说的话，真嗣，”她简单地回答，声音没有一丝犹豫。”

"I did…and so? Why me exactly?"  
“我听到了…那又怎样？为什么偏偏是我？”

"Because I can't entrust this to anyone other than you Shinji."  
“因为我不能把这件事托付给除了你之外的任何人，真嗣。”

Shinji finally turned and looked at Misato, before settling his eyes on Rei…and then Asuka. Finally resigning himself to what Misato had asked, he said, "Fine…whatever."  
真嗣终于转过身，看向美里，然后将目光落在丽身上……接着是明日香。最终，他接受了美里所要求的，说道：“好吧……随便。”

Turning around, he didn't even bother to check to see if Rei and Asuka were following him. Misato however, motioned to both Asuka and Rei to follow Shinji. Rei followed obediently, but Asuka threw Misato a dirty look as she remembered their conversation from earlier.  
他转身离开，甚至懒得确认丽和明日香是否跟在后面。然而，美里示意明日香和丽跟上真嗣。丽顺从地跟了上去，但明日香回想起早先的对话，向美里投去了一个不满的眼神。

Rei entered the elevator first, with Asuka shortly behind her. Asuka then backed herself up against the furthest wall away from Shinji and crossed her arms so tightly it looked as though they'd be stuck that way. She didn't see the need for precautions like this, and thought Misato was being too paranoid.  
丽率先走进电梯，明日香紧随其后。接着，明日香背靠在离真嗣最远的墙上，双臂交叉得紧紧的，仿佛就这样定格了。她觉得没必要采取这种预防措施，认为美里过于多虑了。

As Shinji pushed the down button on the elevator, he looked straight ahead to Misato who was watching him. He knew that she had heard about what had happened between him and Asuka, so he wasn't pleased about having to do something like this. But since she had asked him, he supposed he had to. And he didn't think she would ask if she didn't have a very good reason.  
当真嗣按下电梯的下行按钮时，他直视着正在观察他的美里。他知道她已经听说了他和明日香之间发生的事情，所以他并不乐意做这样的事。但既然她请求了他，他猜想自己不得不这么做。而且他认为，如果不是有非常充分的理由，她也不会提出这样的要求。

As the doors closed in front of him, he watched as Misato's face disappeared in front of him.  
随着电梯门在他面前关闭，他看着美里的脸消失在眼前。

With the doors closed, and the noise from the command center silenced, the silence in the elevator started. It was rather difficult to decide who was giving off the stronger feeling of loathing: Shinji or Asuka? But the tension in the air was stifling.  
电梯门关闭后，指挥中心的噪音也随之消失，电梯内的寂静开始了。很难判断谁散发出的厌恶感更强烈：是真嗣还是明日香？但空气中的紧张感令人窒息。

When the elevator doors finally opened, Asuka darted forward. She didn't want to spend anymore time with this bastard than what she absolutely had to, so she intended to make a beeline straight for the elevator to take her down into Terminal Dogma. But surprisingly Shinji stuck out his arm to stop her.  
当电梯门终于打开时，明日香猛地冲了出去。她不想在这个混蛋身边多待一秒，所以打算直奔电梯，带她下到最终教条区。但出乎意料的是，真嗣伸出手臂拦住了她。

Turning towards him, Asuka snarled as she talked to him against her will, "What the hell do you think you're doing?"  
明日香转过身，不情愿地对他咆哮道：“你到底想干什么？”

"Misato had a reason that she wanted me with you two," said Shinji, his voice laced with annoyance towards Asuka, "but I don't know why. So I don't intend to let you barge ahead of me."  
“美里小姐有她的理由让我和你们俩一起，”真嗣说道，他的声音中带着对明日香的不满，“但我不知道为什么。所以我不会让你冲到我前面去。”

"Do I look like I care?" asked Asuka angrily.  
"我看起来像是在乎吗？" 明日香生气地问道。

"No, you don't. Nor do I honestly care what happens to you, but it's not just you, its Ayanami that's here also. So I'm only going to say this once…stay right behind me…both of you. You first," he said pointing at Asuka, unwilling to speak her name. "And then you Ayanami. And Ayanami-  
"不，你不在乎。老实说，我也不关心你的遭遇，但不仅仅是你在，绫波也在。所以我只说一次……就紧跟在我后面……你们两个。你先来，" 他指着明日香说道，不愿提及她的名字。"然后是你，绫波。还有绫波——

Since she was being addressed, Ayanami turned her head slowly to Shinji and looked at him.  
既然被点名了，绫波缓缓转过头看向真嗣。

"If you feel like someone is behind us, let me know immediately. If you hear something like a click…don't hesitate to deploy your AT-field."  
"如果你觉得有人在我们后面，立刻告诉我。如果听到类似点击的声音……不要犹豫，立即展开你的 AT 力场。"

At Shinji's words, Asuka wheeled around to stare at Rei. She had always known that Rei was different, but an AT-field? Even Rei seemed somewhat surprised at Shinji's statement, because her eyes widened slightly, but she simply nodded her head instead of saying anything.  
听到真嗣的话，明日香转身盯着绫波。她一直知道绫波与众不同，但 AT 力场？就连绫波似乎也对真嗣的话感到有些惊讶，因为她的眼睛微微睁大了些，但她只是点了点头，没有说什么。

"Good. Glad we got that out of the way," said Shinji as he turned away from both of them and peered out of the elevator. After being sure that he didn't see anybody, or feel someone approaching through his AT-field, he walked swiftly out of the elevator and turned to walk down the hallway.  
"很好。很高兴我们把这事说清楚了，""真嗣说着，转身离开她们，朝电梯外望去。确认没有看到任何人，也没有通过 AT 力场感觉到有人接近后，他迅速走出电梯，转身沿着走廊走去。

He could feel Asuka and Rei walking behind him, but he could almost feel the anger emitting off of Asuka. He was rather surprised she hadn't bitten his head off. But maybe the events from before were still weighing heavily on her mind.  
他能感觉到明日香和绫波在他身后走着，但他几乎能感受到明日香散发出的愤怒。他相当惊讶她没有冲他发火。但或许之前发生的事情仍在她心中沉重地压着。

'I wonder what everyone will do after this is all over?' Shinji suddenly thought.  
“我在想，这一切结束后大家会做什么呢？”真嗣突然想到。

As he thought this, he stopped in the middle of the hallway, meaning that Asuka almost crashed into.  
当他这么想着时，他在走廊中间停了下来，这意味着明日香差点撞上了他。

"Why the fuck did you just stop moron!" she yelled at his back.  
"你他妈怎么突然停下来了，白痴！" 她对着他的背影吼道。

Looking over his shoulder at the angry Asuka and passive Rei, he said, "Sorry…I was just thinking what everyone would do after this is all over. Well, at least is if everyone is alive after this I suppose."  
他回头看了一眼愤怒的明日香和冷漠的绫波，说道："抱歉……我只是在想，这一切结束后大家会做什么。嗯，至少如果大家都还活着的话。"

"What kind of a question is that?" retorted Asuka. "I'm not dying!"  
"这是什么问题？" 明日香反驳道。"我不会死的！"

Shinji watched her for a few seconds, during which Asuka realized that he was staring at her, and quickly turned her head away from him.  
真嗣盯着她看了几秒钟，期间明日香意识到他在盯着她，便迅速把头转向别处。

'What an idiot,' she thought while staring at the blank wall next to her.  
'真是个傻瓜，'她一边盯着旁边的空白墙壁一边想。

"What about you then Ikari-kun?" asked Rei surprisingly speaking up.  
“那你自己呢，碇君？”丽意外地开口问道。

If Asuka was surprised at the way Rei addressed Shinji, it was nothing compared to what Shinji felt.  
如果明日香对绫波称呼真嗣的方式感到惊讶，那真嗣的感受则更为强烈。

"I honestly don't expect to make it through this," said Shinji without bothering to pause.  
"老实说，我不指望能挺过这一关，" 真嗣没有停顿地说道。

"What? So you expect to die?" asked Asuka with a slight laugh.  
"什么？所以你觉得自己会死？" 明日香带着一丝笑意问道。

"I do actually," replied Shinji without any sign of hesitation. The smile on Asuka's face however dropped when she saw how serious Shinji was about dying.  
“我真的会，”真嗣回答得毫不犹豫。然而，当明日香看到真嗣对死亡的认真态度时，她脸上的笑容消失了。

'What do I care though,' she thought. 'It's not like it matters to me one way or another.'  
“我何必在乎呢，”她心想，“反正对我来说都无所谓。”

Though as Shinji started walking forward again, it was Rei who stopped him this time.  
尽管真嗣再次开始前行，这次却是丽拦住了他。

"I do not think you should be thinking about dying Ikari-kun," she said  
"碇君，我不认为你应该考虑死亡的事情，" 她说到

Shinji stopped in mid step as Rei said this, but didn't turn around. Asuka however who stood between them was turning from one to the other with a suspicious look on her face.  
听到这话，真嗣停下了脚步，但没有转身。然而，站在他们之间的明日香则来回看着两人，脸上带着怀疑的表情。

'Since when were they able to talk to each other in such a fashion?' she wondered.  
'他们什么时候能这样交谈了？' 她心中疑惑。

"Never mind," said Shinji eventually, "just forget I said anything."  
“没关系，”真嗣最终说道，“就当我什么都没说。”

An indignant 'humph' escaped Asuka's lips as Shinji said this. Muttering slightly, she said, "Then why the hell did you bother stopping us for in the first place? Idiot!"  
听到这话，明日香不满地哼了一声。她小声嘀咕道：“那你一开始干嘛要阻止我们？白痴！”

Many more minutes passed, during which they came closer to the elevator which would take Asuka and Rei down into Terminal Dogma.  
又过了好几分钟，他们离电梯越来越近，那电梯将把明日香和丽带入终端教条区。

"We should just continue on ahead," said Asuka, interrupting the silence from the last few minutes. "It's not like we have far to go anyway."  
"我们应该继续前进，" 明日香打破了过去几分钟的沉默，"反正我们也没多远的路要走了。"

"Misato wanted me to escort you two, so that's exactly what I'm doing," Shinji replied.  
"美里让我护送你们两个，所以我正在这么做，" 真嗣回答道。"

"What part of 'I can't stand another minute with you' do you not under-WAHH!"  
"你到底是怎么理解不了'我一分钟也受不了你了'这句话的——哇啊！"

Shinji suddenly grabbed Asuka's right wrist and dragged her to the far right of the hallway. Many doors lined the hallway on either side, though Shinji had no idea what was concealed behind them. Thankfully though, the wall jutted out slightly so that three people could lean against the door and remain concealed from anybody walking down the hallway.  
真嗣突然抓住明日香的右手腕，将她拖到走廊的最右侧。走廊两侧排列着许多门，尽管真嗣并不知道门后隐藏着什么。幸运的是，墙壁稍微凸出，使得三个人可以靠在门上，从而不被经过走廊的人发现。

As Shinji pushed Asuka against one of the corners of the door he looked beside him to see Rei there. It seemed that she had seen his brief gesture before he had grabbed Asuka.  
当真嗣将明日香推到门角时，他转头看到丽也在旁边。似乎在他抓住明日香之前，丽已经注意到了他短暂的示意。

Spitting hair out of her mouth, Asuka scowled at Shinji as she raised the volume in her voice.  
明日香吐出口中的头发，皱着眉头瞪着真嗣，提高了嗓门。

"What the fuck are you do-"  
"你他妈在搞什么-"

But Shinji cut her off with a sharp hiss that escaped between his teeth.  
但真嗣用牙齿间发出的尖锐嘶声打断了她。

"Shut up for a minute," Shinji said quietly.  
"安静一会儿，"真嗣平静地说。

"What the fuck are you going on abou-"  
"你到底在胡说八道些什么-"

But then Asuka heard footsteps coming from down the hallway. Thinking of peering around the corner silently, Shinji stopped her though as he tightened his grip on her wrist. He hadn't bothered to let go yet. Asuka glared back at him, but remained silent. Shinji meanwhile inhaled deeply before he looked carefully around the corner.  
但随后，明日香听到了走廊另一头传来的脚步声。她本想悄悄探头看看，但真嗣紧握她手腕的动作阻止了她。他还没松手。明日香瞪了他一眼，却保持沉默。与此同时，真嗣深吸一口气，小心翼翼地探头观察拐角处的情况。

Far down the hallway were two security guards with submachine guns. They were walking towards Shinji and the other two.  
走廊尽头，两名手持冲锋枪的保安正朝真嗣和其他两人走来。

"There are two security guards walking towards us," said Shinji the second he leaned up against the door again.  
“有两个保安正朝我们走来，”真嗣一靠回门上就说道。

"So? Then they can help us," said Asuka.  
“那又怎样？他们可以帮我们，”明日香说。

Shinji was silent though. He didn't know why, but he was feeling paranoid all the sudden. Earlier, just before he grabbed Asuka's wrist, he had had a brief flash of a vision. It wasn't something he'd care to see happen. And Misato's words were weighing heavily on his mind.  
但真嗣沉默了。他不知道为什么，突然间感到非常多疑。之前，就在他抓住明日香手腕之前，他短暂地闪现了一个预感。那不是他想看到的事情。而且美里的话也沉重地压在他的心头。

Asuka, however, thought otherwise.  
然而，明日香却有不同的想法。

Breaking free of Shinji's grip on her, she darted out into the open hallway and stood in front of the two guards. If they were surprised to see her, Shinji felt equally surprised at how stupid a thing Asuka had just done.  
她挣脱了真嗣抓着她的手，冲进空旷的走廊，站在两名守卫面前。如果他们见到她感到惊讶，真嗣也同样惊讶于明日香刚刚所做的愚蠢行为。

"Dear God am I glad to see somebody helpful," started Asuka. "I'm the pilot of Evangelion Unit 02 and with me is the First. We were ordered to head towards the elevator that would take us to Terminal Dogma. However, our escort is rather retarded, so I was hoping that you could lend your assistance."  
“感谢上帝，终于见到个能帮忙的了，”明日香开口道，“我是 EVA 二号机的驾驶员，这位是初号机的驾驶员。我们接到命令前往电梯，直达最终教条区。不过我们的向导相当迟钝，所以希望你们能提供帮助。”

It was amazing how formal Asuka could be while talking to an adult.  
令人惊叹的是，明日香在与成年人交谈时能有多么正式。

The soldiers looked at each then and nodded their heads as though coming to an agreement on something. Asuka, however, took that as them willing to help her.  
士兵们互相看了一眼，然后点头，仿佛就某事达成了共识。然而，明日香却认为他们愿意帮助她。

"Thanks a lot. You have no idea how much help this-"  
“非常感谢。你不知道这对我帮助有多大——”

Both of the guards simultaneously raised their guns and pointed them at both her eyes, so that the crossfire would explode out different sides of her skull.  
两名守卫同时举起枪，对准她的双眼，意图让交叉火力从她头颅的不同侧面爆裂开来。

Asuka had just enough time to realize her mistake before she closed her eyes and waited for the inevitable. Hearing the sound of the discharged bullets leaving the barrel of the guns, she opened her mouth to scream, but when she opened her mouth, it was not her voice that resonated through the hallway, but the voice of a male in his early thirties.  
在闭上眼睛等待不可避免的命运之前，明日香刚刚来得及意识到自己的错误。听到子弹从枪管中射出的声音，她张开嘴尖叫，但当她张开嘴时，回荡在走廊中的并非她的声音，而是一个三十岁左右男性的声音。

As Asuka slowly opened her eyes, she saw a strange scene in front of her. Shinji was standing directly in front of her, being so close that she could have reached out and placed both her hands on his back. Rei was standing slightly to the right and in front of him; both of them had their AT-fields deployed, while the guards were on the ground with bloody stumps for their right hands.  
当明日香缓缓睁开眼睛时，她眼前出现了一幕奇异的景象。真嗣就站在她正前方，近到她几乎可以伸手触及他的背部。绫波则站在他稍右前方；两人都展开了 AT 力场，而守卫们则倒在地上，右手变成了血淋淋的断肢。

Shinji winced as blood trickled down his right shoulder and left arm, staining his white shirt. He had almost been too slow. As the guards fired their weapons, Shinji moved directly in front of Asuka while deploying his AT-field. Shinji had managed to split the bullets in half, but the velocity from the front part of the bullets still managed to lodge themselves in his upper shoulder, and lower arm.  
血液顺着真嗣的右肩和左臂流淌，染红了白色的衬衫，他几乎反应得太迟。当守卫们开火时，真嗣迅速移动到明日香前方并展开了他的 AT 力场。他成功地将子弹一分为二，但前半部分子弹的冲击力仍使它们嵌入了他的上肩和前臂。

Rei had actually been the one that had disarmed the soldiers. As she saw what Shinji was doing, she reacted also. Moving in front of Shinji, seconds after he deployed his AT-field, she deployed hers. She had sliced the right hands off both the guards, making them drop their guns and rendering themselves useless.  
实际上是绫波解除了士兵们的武装。看到真嗣的行动后，她也迅速反应。在真嗣展开 AT 力场几秒后，她移动到他前面并展开了自己的力场。她切断了两个守卫的右手，使他们丢掉了枪支，变得毫无用处。

Shinji now walked away from Asuka who was still standing shell shocked where moments ago, she had almost been shot. Standing beside Rei, Shinji looked down at both of the guards. One of them seemed to have already passed out from the blood loss, but the other still seemed to be conscious. Shinji quickly remedied that by smashing the heel of his shoe on the face of the guard, sending him quickly into unconscious. Shinji now understood why Misato had wanted him with these two. Rei could take care of herself, but Asuka was a different matter.  
真嗣现在离开了仍然站在原地、惊魂未定的明日香，就在片刻之前，她差点被枪击中。真嗣站在绫波身边，低头看着两名守卫。其中一人似乎因失血过多已经昏迷，但另一人似乎还清醒着。真嗣迅速解决了这个问题，用鞋跟猛击守卫的脸部，让他迅速陷入昏迷。真嗣现在明白了美里为什么希望他和这两个人在一起。绫波可以自保，但明日香的情况就不同了。

"It seems that the enemy has already infiltrated," said Rei, surprisingly speaking before Shinji.  
“看来敌人已经渗透进来了，”绫波说道，出乎意料地抢在真嗣之前开口。

"Yeah, and they've placed spies on the inside that carry guns. I just hope that not many more of them have been bought."  
“是啊，他们还在内部安插了持枪的间谍。我只希望被收买的人不多。”

It was strange how easily money and a promise could change the allegiance of someone.  
真是奇怪，金钱和一个承诺就能如此轻易地改变一个人的忠诚。

Turning around to face Asuka, Shinji couldn't hurt but feel a little sorry for her. However, it had entirely been her fault.  
转过身面对明日香，真嗣不禁对她感到一丝歉意。然而，这完全是她的错。

Walking up to her, he waited till her face was not pointed to the ground. Eventually, she raised her head up to look at him.  
他走上前去，等到她的脸不再朝向地面。最终，她抬起头来看着他。

"Are you hurt?" was the first thing that came out of Shinji's mouth. But it didn't sound worried or sincere.  
"你受伤了吗？" 这是真嗣脱口而出的第一句话。但听起来并不担心，也不真诚。

"No…I'm not," said Asuka after realizing that she was not  
"不…我没有，" 明日香意识到自己并未受伤后说道

"That was very stupid…what you did. Didn't I say earlier not to barge ahead of me? If I had been one second late, you would have died."  
"你那样做真是太蠢了…我之前不是说过不要抢在我前面吗？如果我晚了一秒，你就已经死了。"

"I know…" said Asuka as her face dropped back to facing the ground. "Sorry," she eventually mumbled.  
"我知道……" 明日香说着，脸又垂向地面。"对不起，" 她最终喃喃道。

Though Asuka didn't see it, relief seemed to wash over Shinji's face. Choosing that it would be better not to say anything, Shinji turned away from her and started walking towards there destination when he heard Asuka mumble words that were barely audible.  
虽然明日香没有看到，但解脱的表情似乎掠过了真嗣的脸庞。他选择最好还是不要说什么，于是转身离开她，开始向目的地走去，这时他听到明日香喃喃自语，声音几乎听不清。

"Thank you…" "谢谢你……"

Shinji ignored her, knowing that it was better not to reply. Asuka however wasn't done talking.  
真嗣没有理会她，心里明白最好还是不要回应。然而，明日香的话还没说完。

"Misato told me something like this would happen…"  
“美里小姐告诉我可能会发生这种事……”

Shinji, against his will, turned around to face her and asked, "What did she say?"  
真嗣违心地转过身面对她，问道：“她说什么了？”

"That Seele may have placed spies within our own ranks to find out what we were planning and the passages of Nerv."  
"Seele 可能在我们的队伍中安插了间谍，以探知我们的计划和 Nerv 的通道。"

"You should have told me this earlier, we would have been more careful."  
"你应该早点告诉我，我们会更加小心。"

"I know," mumbled Asuka. "我知道，" 明日香咕哝道。"

"Forget it…it's in the past. Anyways…let's go already," said Shinji.  
“算了吧…那都是过去的事了。总之…我们走吧，”真嗣说道。

Rei nodded and started walking in step with Shinji, leaving Asuka to watch both of their retreating backs. She didn't know why, but she felt oddly resentful towards Rei. Maybe it was because she and Shinji were similar; that Rei was able to walk beside Shinji because she understood him.  
绫波点点头，开始与真嗣并肩而行，留下明日香看着他们两人的背影。她不知道为什么，但总觉得对绫波有种莫名的怨恨。或许是因为她和真嗣相似；绫波能走在真嗣身边，是因为她理解他。

'What kind of bullshit thinking is that?' wondered Asuka.  
“这是什么狗屁想法？”明日香心想。

Hurrying up so that she was directly behind Shinji and Rei, she said, "I thought we were supposed to go in line?"  
她急忙走到真嗣和绫波身后，说道：“我以为我们应该排队进去？”

"You're right," replied Shinji without thinking about it for a minute. Nodding towards Rei, she paused to let Asuka in front of her, and resumed her position in the back.  
“你说得对，”真嗣不假思索地回答。他向绫波点头示意，让她停下让明日香走到前面，然后自己重新回到队伍的最后。

"Much better," said Asuka as though she was mocking Rei. Shinji frowned inwardly at her superior attitude, but next second winced as he felt several sharp splinters of pain hit his body.  
“好多了，”明日香带着嘲讽的语气说道，仿佛在嘲笑绫波。真嗣内心对她的优越态度皱了皱眉，但下一秒却因身体感受到几处剧痛而抽搐了一下。

"Oi, move forward idiot! Can't you see I'm ready?"  
"喂，往前走啊，白痴！没看到我准备好了吗？"

But still Shinji didn't move as the bullets were forced out of his body as new flesh caked over the wounds. The ends of the bullets fell to the floor with a clatter, making Asuka jump slightly.  
然而，真嗣依旧没有动弹，子弹从他体内被逼出，新生的肉覆盖了伤口。子弹头叮当作响地落在地板上，让明日香微微一跳。

"What was-" but then she looked down at the floor and saw the bullets. Though she couldn't see the front of Shinji's face, she saw that he had been in pain moments before.  
"这是怎么——"但她随即低头看向地板，发现了那些子弹。尽管看不到真嗣正面的表情，她能看出他刚才经历了痛苦。

'Idiot,' she thought. 'If he was hurt, he should have just said something…we could have waited.'  
'白痴,' 她心想. '如果他受伤了, 他应该直接说出来...我们可以等一等的.'

Without saying anything about his wounds, Shinji continued walking towards the elevator with Asuka and Rei behind him. Though nobody talked, there was an air of understanding between the three of them.  
尽管伤口未曾提及, 真嗣继续朝着电梯走去, 身后跟着明日香和绫波. 虽然没人说话, 但他们之间弥漫着一种默契的氛围.

As they neared the elevator, Shinji became increasingly anxious. Several times he had them pause and hide somewhere as he felt the AT-fields of people near them, but nothing like before happened again.  
当他们接近电梯时, 真嗣变得越来越焦虑. 有好几次他让他们停下来并躲在某处, 因为他感觉到附近人们的 AT 力场, 但之后再也没有发生类似之前的事情.

Finally reaching the elevator, Shinji paused for a minute to be sure that nobody was around before he pressed on the down button that would take Asuka and Rei down into Terminal Dogma. When the elevator arrived, he nodded towards both Asuka and Rei while mumbling, "Get it."  
终于到达电梯前，真嗣停顿了一下，确保周围无人后，才按下了通往终端教条区的下行按钮。电梯到达时，他向明日香和绫波点头示意，同时含糊地说道：“进去吧。”

Rei followed obediently, but Asuka for some reason stayed back. Shinji was rather surprised by this, considering she had been desperate to get away from him earlier. After waiting for a few minutes though, he said, "Get in already. Weren't you just wanting to get away from me a while ago?"  
绫波顺从地跟了进去，但明日香不知为何却留在了原地。考虑到她之前急切地想要离开他，真嗣对此颇感意外。不过，等了几分钟后，他说道：“快进来吧。你刚才不是还急着要离开我吗？”

Asuka frowned at him and said, "Why should I really? I'm an Evangelion pilot like yourself. I can help!"  
明日香皱着眉对他说：“我为什么要听你的？我也是一名 EVA 驾驶员，我也能帮忙！”

"First and foremost," started Shinji, "your Evangelion is out of commission, and you are nothing like me. I am able to help in different ways because I am not entirely human."  
"首先，" 真嗣开口道，"你的 EVA 已经无法运作，而你和我截然不同。我能够以不同的方式提供帮助，因为我并非完全的人类。"

"I can still help other ways!" shouted Asuka. "I learned how to fire a gun and had hand to hand combat training at the Nerv headquarters in Germany."  
"我还有其他方式可以帮忙！" 明日香喊道。"我在德国的 NERV 总部学会了开枪，还接受了近身格斗训练。"

"Can you kill somebody up close with a gun? Can you choke away the life of another human being?"  
"你能用枪近距离杀死一个人吗？你能亲手掐灭另一个人的生命吗？"

Asuka opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out. She was rather startled at Shinji's question, but it was all the hesitation he needed. Grabbing her again by her right wrist, he dragged her in front of the elevator before pushing her roughly through the door where Rei surprisingly caught her by the shoulders.  
明日香张开嘴想要说话，却什么也没说出来。她对真嗣的问题感到相当惊讶，但这正是他所需要的犹豫。他再次抓住她的右手腕，将她拖到电梯前，粗鲁地推她进门，而令人意外的是，绫波在门口稳稳地扶住了她的肩膀。

"What are you-" Asuka shouted at both Shinji and Rei.  
“你们到底在——” 明日香对着真嗣和绫波大喊。

"You'll be too much of a nuisance if you stay here and try to help. Its better if you go down into Terminal Dogma," said Shinji.  
“如果你留在这里试图帮忙，会是个大麻烦。你还是下到最终教条区比较好，”真嗣说道。

"You bastard! Just because I'm not you-"  
"你这个混蛋！就因为我不是你——"

"You should be glad you're not me," retorted Shinji angrily. "As I said, you can't be of any help. So just say down there until somebody either calls you up, or until…"  
"你应该庆幸你不是我，" 真嗣生气地反驳道。"就像我说的，你帮不上任何忙。所以就乖乖待在那儿，直到有人叫你上来，或者直到……"

Shinji didn't want to think of that possibility, but it wasn't as though he could rule it out.  
真嗣不想去想那种可能性，但也不是说他可以完全排除这种可能。

"Forget it," he said hurriedly.  
“算了吧，”他急忙说道。

Though as he stepped back so that Rei could push the button that would close the doors and send them on their way, Asuka suddenly drew her fist backwards and shouted with every intention of hitting Shinji, "Just because I'm not special like you doesn't mean I can't help you…you…YOU IDIOT!"  
尽管当他后退一步，让丽按下按钮关闭车门并启动列车时，明日香突然将拳头向后一拉，大声喊道，满心想要揍真嗣：“就因为我不如你那么特别，并不意味着我不能帮你……你……你这个白痴！”

Swinging her fist forward, Shinji easily caught it without batting an eyelash and twisted it upwards, making Asuka's eyebrows twitch with pain.  
明日香挥拳向前，真嗣毫不费力地接住了她的拳头，连眼都没眨一下，并将其扭向上方，痛得明日香眉头一皱。

"I don't have time to deal with this," mumbled Shinji.  
"我没时间处理这个，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Leaning down next to Asuka's ear, he inhaled her scent which he had been so accustomed to smelling early mornings in Misato's apartment just after she took a shower.  
他俯身靠近明日香的耳边，深吸了一口她那熟悉的气息，那是他在美里公寓清晨她刚洗完澡后常闻到的味道。

"If you tried to do what I'm going to do, you wouldn't last a second moron." Though he said moron, his voice held no malice or spite in it.  
"如果你尝试做我即将做的事，你连一秒钟都撑不住，傻瓜。" 虽然他说了傻瓜，但语气中并没有恶意或怨恨。

"Furthermore…I couldn't be looking over my shoulder every second to be sure you were okay."  
"再说了…我不能每时每刻都回头确认你没事。"

"You wouldn't have to, I'd-"  
"你不必这样，我会-"

"Enough!" said Shinji silencing her quickly.  
"够了！" 真嗣迅速打断了她。

Placing both his hands on her shoulders he pushed her back into the elevator. But it was different than the other times he had pushed or shoved her. It was both caring and gentle, something Asuka had never felt before from him. And something else…it was almost…pleasant?  
他将双手放在她的肩膀上，轻轻地将她推回电梯。但这次与以往他推搡她的情形不同。这次既体贴又温柔，是绫波从未从他那里感受到的。还有些别的……几乎……令人愉快？

Feeling as though she was walking on air, Asuka fell back a few steps before she caught her balance and looked up into Shinji's face. He was smiling.  
绫波感觉自己仿佛在空中漫步，后退了几步才稳住身形，抬头望向真嗣的脸。他在微笑。

"See Ya….Ayanami…Asuka…" “再见……绫波……绫波……”

Asuka's eyes widened as he spoke her name. She was certain that he had never used it before, and without knowing it herself, her feet started to carry her forward, as though they longed to be on that side with him, even if it put her in danger. But before she could get to him, the elevator doors closed in front of her, cutting off the boys smiling face in front of her.  
听到他叫她的名字，明日香瞪大了眼睛。她确信他以前从未这样叫过她，不知不觉中，她的脚步开始向前移动，仿佛渴望与他同在一边，即使这会让她陷入危险。但还没等她走到他身边，电梯门就在她面前关闭了，切断了男孩在她面前的笑脸。

Wheeling around to one side of the elevator, Asuka saw that Rei was standing next to the elevator and had her forefinger pressed down on the down button.  
明日香转身走到电梯的一侧，看到丽站在电梯旁边，用食指按着下行按钮。

"Bring the elevator back up this instance!" Asuka shouted angrily at her.  
“把电梯再升上来！”明日香生气地对她喊道。

"I am unable to do that," replied Rei.  
"我无法做到那一点，"丽回答道。

"Why the fuck not?" "为什么他妈的不行？"

Rei was silent for a minute before she said, "Because Ikari-kun has made his decision."  
丽沉默了一会儿，然后说："因为碇君已经做出了他的决定。"

"What the fuck is that supposed to mean!" yelled Asuka. "You know what, I don't care. I'll bring the elevator back up there myself and drag his sorry ass down here with us."  
"这他妈是什么意思！" 明日香吼道。"你知道吗，我不在乎。我会自己把电梯弄回来，把他那该死的屁股拖下来跟我们一起。"

As Asuka reached for the control panel though, Rei stopped her by grabbing the same wrist that that boys hand had held onto moments before.  
正当明日香伸手去够控制面板时，绫波零抓住了她的手腕，正是那个男孩片刻前握住的那只手。

"LET GO OF ME DAMN IT!" Asuka roared back at Rei  
"放开我，该死的！" 明日香对着绫波零咆哮道

"I can't do that," replied Rei simply, not even raising her voice at all.  
"我做不到," 丽简单地回答，声音甚至没有提高半分。

"WHY THE FUCK NOT?" "为什么他妈的不行？"

"Because Ikari-kun has made his decision."  
"因为碇君已经做出了他的决定。"

"Who the fuck are you to decide what his decision is. How could you….but I…"  
"你他妈凭什么决定他的选择。你怎么能……但我……"

It was then that Asuka finally understood something. What Shinji had been talking about earlier…about dying…and what the First had said.  
就在那时，明日香终于明白了些什么。真嗣之前谈论的关于死亡的事……还有初号机所说的那些。

"Don't tell me…that idiot…plans on dying?"  
"别告诉我……那个白痴……打算去死？"

Asuka stared back at Rei, waiting for her to give some sort of answer, but when she didn't, Asuka grabbed her by the front of her school uniform and shouted at her-  
明日香瞪着丽，等待她给出某种回答，但她没有回应，明日香便抓住她的校服前襟，冲她大喊——

"ANSWER ME DAMN IT!" “回答我，该死的！”

Just as she said this, the elevator doors opened, revealing many soldiers with assault rifles watching the confrontation in front of them. Asuka however seemed to notice that they had a group of people watching them now, because she let go of Rei's collar and took several steps back before turning around, making her hair whip across her face.  
就在她说这话时，电梯门打开了，露出许多手持突击步枪的士兵，他们正注视着面前的对峙。然而明日香似乎注意到了他们现在被一群人围观，于是她松开了丽的衣领，后退几步，转过身去，让头发甩过脸庞。

As she walked towards the soldiers, they created a path for her, as though Asuka had just created an invisible wall between her and the soldiers.  
当她走向士兵们时，他们为她让出一条路，仿佛明日香在她和士兵之间创造了一堵无形的墙。

Continuing to walk down the corridor, she eventually saw an orderly waiting for her and nodded slightly towards him. He understood, and pointed in the direction of the bunker she and Rei would be residing in until further notice.  
继续沿着走廊前行，她最终看到一名勤务兵在等她，并向他微微点头。他心领神会，指向她和绫波将暂时居住的掩体方向。

However, as Asuka neared the door at the end of the hall that was slightly ajar and leaking white light into the darkened hallway, she only thought one thing.  
然而，当明日香走近走廊尽头那扇半开、透出白光洒入昏暗走廊的门时，她心中只有一个念头。

'I won't ever forgive you if you die Shinji.'  
'如果你死了，我永远不会原谅你，真嗣。'

Though she didn't know it, she had spoken similar words before, but she couldn't remember them.  
虽然她并不知道，她曾说过类似的话，但她记不起来了。

---

"Was there any trouble?" asked Misato.  
“有什么麻烦吗？”美里问道。

"There was, as you thought," replied Shinji.  
"正如你所想，" 真嗣回答道。

He was back in the command center and just telling Misato about the run in with the two 'guards.'  
他回到了指挥中心，正向美里讲述与那两名'警卫'的遭遇。

"And? What happened? Was anybody hurt?"  
"然后呢？发生了什么？有人受伤吗？"

"Meaning Ayanami and Asuka? No, neither of them were hurt, but there are two guards who will have to learn to eat with their left hands most likely.  
“绫波和明日香的意思？不，她们都没受伤，但有两名警卫恐怕得学会用左手吃饭了。”

Misato smiled slightly at Shinji's joke, but continued on in a business like tone. This was after all not a time to be making jokes.  
美里对真嗣的笑话微微一笑，但随即恢复了公事公办的语气。毕竟，现在不是开玩笑的时候。

"Good, I'm glad to hear that, because I have another job for you to do."  
“很好，很高兴听到这个消息，因为我还有另一项任务要交给你。”

Turning away from Shinji, she crossed her arms and bit her lip as she looked at the monitor.  
她转身背对真嗣，双臂交叉，咬着下唇盯着监视器。

"I was right in guessing that they had placed spies on the inside a while ago," said Misato, "but I hope that my next hunch is right also…"  
“我猜对了，他们早就在内部安插了间谍，”美里说道，“但我希望我的下一个直觉也是对的……”

"…Meaning?" asked Shinji after Misato didn't continue talking for a few seconds.  
“……什么意思？”真嗣在美里沉默了几秒后问道。

"We never expected them to give us the full hour to rethink the surrender, and this attempted attack as you were escorting Asuka and Rei is understandable now. I'm guessing they planned to catch us off guard, though I can't understand how they expected that to work."  
"我们从未预料到他们会给我们整整一个小时来重新考虑投降，而你们护送明日香和绫波时遭遇的这次攻击，现在看来是可以理解的。我猜他们是想趁我们不备，不过我不明白他们指望这能有什么效果。"

"What does this have to do with me exactly?" asked Shinji.  
"这跟我具体有什么关系？" 真嗣问道。"

Misato turned back around and addressed him as she said, "You said before that Gate 1 would most likely be the first to be attacked, and while this is true, I am more worried about Gates 5 and 6."  
美里转过身来，对他说："你之前提到过，一号门很可能会首先遭到攻击，虽然这是事实，但我更担心的是五号门和六号门。"

"Is it because of the Evangelions?"  
"是因为那些福音战士吗？"

"Precisely! Gates 5 and 6 are closer to the Evangelions, with Gate 5 being the less defendable of the two. Shinji, I want you to go alone, and man the defenses of Gate 5. This is something that only you can do. I give you full authority to act as you see fit. If there is ever a time when you feel like you are being overwhelmed, I want you to retreat to the Evangelions chamber and board Unit 01. Though there is one thing I have to ask you to do. When you board Unit 01, you will need to destroy Unit 02, otherwise if another nation may capture it will be-"  
"正是如此！5 号门和 6 号门离福音战士更近，其中 5 号门防御较为薄弱。真嗣，我要你独自前往，守卫 5 号门的防线。这是只有你能完成的任务。我授予你全权，按你的判断行事。如果感到力不从心，就撤退到福音战士的机库，登上 01 号机。但有一件事我必须要求你，当你登上 01 号机时，必须摧毁 02 号机，否则如果被其他国家捕获，将会——"

"What!" asked Shinji cutting her off angrily. "You want me to destroy Unit 02, after I did my best to protect it."  
"什么！" 真嗣愤怒地打断她，"你要我摧毁 02 号机，我可是竭尽全力保护它的。"

"Shinji, other nations may try to capture Unit 02. We can't let that happen."  
"真嗣，其他国家可能会试图捕获 02 号机。我们不能让这种事情发生。"

"So! What about the other combat models like Unit 03? I thought that they were developing other Units in other nations?"  
"那么！其他战斗机型怎么办，比如 03 号机？我以为其他国家也在研发其他 EVA 机体？"

"While that is what I had assumed," replied Misato, whose voice had risen slightly, "it seems that at some point in the productions of the other Eva Units, all personal and resources were moved over to work on the mass produced Eva Units. Unit 01 and Unit 02 are the last remaining models since the Prototype and Unit 03 were destroyed."  
"虽然我之前也是这么认为的，"" 美里回答道，声音略微提高了一些，""但似乎在其他 EVA 机体的生产过程中，所有人员和资源都被转移去研发量产型 EVA 了。01 号机和 02 号机是目前仅存的型号，因为原型机和 03 号机已经被摧毁。"

"I don't care," said Shinji refuting both of Misato's statements. "I can't destroy Unit 02."  
"我不在乎，" 真嗣反驳了美里的话，"我不能摧毁二号机。"

"Why?" asked Misato. "Or are you suggesting that Asuka pilot it again?"  
"为什么？" 美里问，"还是说你建议让明日香再次驾驶它？"

"I never said that!" yelled Shinji lashing out at her, but Misato held her ground.  
"我从没那么说过！" 真嗣对她大喊，但美里坚定地站在原地。"

"Weren't you the one who didn't want her involved with the Evangelions anymore?"  
"你不是那个不想让她再和 EVA 扯上关系的人吗？"

"I was…but…" "我曾是……但……"

Taking a rather deep breath, Shinji said-  
深吸了一口气，真嗣说道——

"Misato I…while I was fighting Unit 02 when Kaoru was controlling it, Unit 02 broke free of his control over it and…something happened. Asuka…Asuka's mother is residing in Unit 02…it's the same thing as my mother…"  
"美里，我……在与由薰控制的两号机战斗时，两号机摆脱了他的控制，然后……发生了一些事。明日香……明日香的母亲就在两号机里……和我母亲的情况一样……"

Misato blinked several times to hold her surprise instead of shouting out. She had met Asuka's mother several times during her trips to the Nerv branch of Germany, and even at one point wondered abou the connection between Unit 02, Asuka, and her mother, but had always thought her suspicions had been groundless.  
美里眨了几次眼，强压下惊讶没有喊出来。她曾在访问德国 NERV 分部时多次见过明日香的母亲，甚至一度怀疑过二号机、明日香和她母亲之间的联系，但始终认为自己的猜疑毫无根据。

"Did you…talk to her?" Misato finally asked.  
"你……和她交谈了吗？" 美里终于问道。

Shinji had to think back to that instance when he had thought he'd heard her speak. Everything had happened so fast, that even now, it seemed like a blur.  
真嗣不得不回想起那个瞬间，他曾以为自己听到了她的声音。一切发生得太快，以至于现在，那一切仍像是一片模糊。

"I didn't really talk to her," said Shinji after a moments pause. "It was more like…I just understood what she was trying to tell me."  
"我并没有真正和她交谈，"真嗣在片刻停顿后说道，"更像是……我只是明白了她试图告诉我的事情。"

"What was that?" "那是什么？"

"Well…after Unit 02 broke free of Kaoru's control, or he let go of it, I don't really know, it seemed…angry at me, or I should say Asuka's mother was angry at me, for what I did to Asuka."  
"嗯…在 02 号机摆脱了薰的控制，或者说他放开了控制之后，我不太清楚，它似乎…对我很生气，或者应该说明日香的妈妈对我很生气，因为我对明日香所做的事。"

Misato nodded her head to show that she understood.  
美里点点头，表示她理解了。

"I realized then how important this was to Asuka, and how important Asuka was to her mother. I couldn't bring myself to destroy it…and I still can't do it. I don't know if this is a favor to Asuka from me, my last, but I still can't destroy it. It's like…a part of her…"  
"那时我意识到这对明日香有多重要，以及明日香对她母亲有多重要。我无法让自己摧毁它…而且我现在仍然做不到。我不知道这是否是我对明日香的最后一次帮助，但我仍然无法摧毁它。它就像是…她的一部分…"

Misato understood well enough Shinji's feelings on the matter, but she still thought that it would be better to destroy Unit 02, as cold hearted as that sounded. Unit 02 held no value to Nerv, but it held great value to other nations. It was probably the reason that so many nations took part in the attack on Nerv: they all wanted to capture an Evangelion and strengthen there nation with it. But if Shinji was going to stand in her way…after all, only another Eva could destroy Unit 02 at this point.  
美里非常理解真嗣对此事的感受，但她仍然认为摧毁二号机是更好的选择，尽管这听起来冷酷无情。二号机对 NERV 毫无价值，但对其他国家却意义重大。很可能正是这个原因，许多国家参与了对 NERV 的攻击：他们都想要捕获一台 EVA，以此来增强自己国家的实力。但如果真嗣执意要阻拦……毕竟，此时此刻只有另一台 EVA 才能摧毁二号机。

"Fine then," said Misato after resigning to Shinji's request. "You can do what you see fit with Unit 02."  
“好吧，”美里在无奈接受真嗣的请求后说道，“你可以按照自己的想法处理二号机。”

"Thank you Misato," said Shinji before he turned around and started walking towards the elevator that he had just been in.  
“谢谢你，美里。”真嗣说完，转身向刚刚乘坐过的电梯走去。

"Shinji…wait just a minute," said Misato to Shinji's retreating back.  
"真嗣…等一下，" 美里对着真嗣离去的背影说道。

"Yes?" asked Shinji as he looked over his shoulder.  
"什么事？" 真嗣回头问道。

"I'm sorry that…I ask all this of you, but I can't-"  
"我很抱歉…让你承担这一切，但我不能-"

"Don't worry about it Misato," replied Shinji as he continued walking away from her. "Just consider this as me paying off my debt from living in your apartment for those six months"  
"别担心，美里，" 真嗣回答道，继续远离她。"就当这是我偿还在你公寓住了六个月的债吧"

And with that, he disappeared through the door of the elevator, leaving Misato standing there in the command center.  
说完，他消失在电梯门后，留下美里独自站在指挥中心。

Misato however issued a silent prayer then, having never prayed before in her life. She wished that her, Asuka, and Shinji could go back to the days before all this, when they blissfully spent there days living together in her apartment.  
然而，美里在那一刻默默地祈祷，尽管她一生中从未祈祷过。她希望自己、明日香和真嗣能回到这一切发生之前的日子，那时他们幸福地一起生活在她的公寓里。

Her prayer was never founded however…  
然而，她的祈祷从未得到回应……

---

Shinji stood in front of a giant metal door with the word Gate 5 in red letters spewed across it. This was where the enemy was expected to attack first if they were headed towards the Evangelion Units. Shinji would fight all alone here, as he preferred it. Nobody would be injured in case he went out of control.  
真嗣站在一扇巨大的金属门前，门上用红色字母写着‘5 号门’。如果敌人是冲着 EVA 机体来的，这里预计会是他们首先攻击的地方。真嗣将独自在这里战斗，这是他更喜欢的。万一他失控，也不会有人受伤。

Walking away from the gate though, he walked some ways to the far right side of the wall and propped himself up against it. If he had to be honest with himself, he was rather looking forward to fighting against armed soldiers whose only purpose was taking his life. He even rather wished that they would drive a tank through the gate. At least then his AT-field would have something to do other then blocking bullets.  
尽管离开了大门，他还是走到了墙的右侧远处，靠在墙上。如果他对自己诚实的话，他其实很期待与那些唯一目的就是夺取他生命的武装士兵战斗。他甚至希望他们能开着坦克冲进来。至少那样他的 AT 力场除了挡子弹外还有别的事情可做。

He held no qualms about injuring the enemy if it prolonged his own life and weakened them. It was simply easier to refer to them as the enemy now, or the opposition. If he started thinking about them as other human beings, his resolve may waver.  
他毫不犹豫地伤害敌人，只要这能延长自己的生命并削弱对方。现在称呼他们为敌人或对手更为简单。如果他开始将他们视为其他人类，他的决心可能会动摇。

He wondered about many things as he leaned against the wall and waited for the attack, how he would die, what would happen to everyone if Seele won, and what that bastard would do.  
他靠在墙上等待攻击时，思绪万千，思考着自己会如何死去，如果 Seele 获胜，每个人会面临什么，以及那个混蛋会做什么。

He didn't think about him that much admittedly. He knew that he had his own version of Third Impact that differed from Seele's, but he couldn't really know what his actual intentions were. He figured it had something to do with the DNA he had stolen from him though.  
不可否认，他并没有过多地思考他。他知道他有自己的第三次冲击计划，与 Seele 的不同，但他无法真正了解他的真实意图。他猜测这可能与他从他那里盗取的 DNA 有关。

As he thought of that bastard though, his thoughts turned towards his mother. Even since he had come to know that his mother was right beside him every time he stepped into the entry plug of Unit 01, he had found it easier to pilot, even enjoyable sometimes. But he now wondered whether his mother had known what she was putting her son through when she…well…it was best not to think about the specifics. But Shinji did remember how she had never referred to Gendo as 'your father' when they had briefly talked. She had only referred to him as 'Gendo' making it seem that they held no special attachment except for being in the same college class. So Shinji often wondered why that bastard was so determined to see his mother again.  
然而，每当他想到那个混蛋时，他的思绪就会转向他的母亲。自从他得知母亲每次他进入初号机插入栓时都在他身边，他发现自己更容易驾驶，有时甚至感到愉快。但他现在想知道，母亲是否知道她让儿子经历了什么，当她……嗯……最好不要细想具体细节。但真嗣确实记得，在他们短暂的交谈中，她从未称碇源堂为“你的父亲”，她只称他为“碇”，似乎除了同班同学之外，他们之间没有任何特殊关系。所以真嗣常常想知道，为什么那个混蛋如此坚决地想要再次见到他的母亲。

Though as his mind wandered farther, they eventually settled on a certain someone. He didn't want to think about her right, because if he knew, then he would start to lose concentrating. He wasn't sure even how, but she still managed to get under his skin and make him drop his guard.  
尽管他的思绪飘得更远，最终还是落在了某个人身上。他不想现在就想到她，因为如果他知道，他就会开始失去专注力。他甚至不确定她是如何做到的，但她仍然能钻进他的心里，让他放下戒备。

'And what had earlier been all about?' wondered Shinji as he continued thinking about Asuka.  
“之前到底是怎么回事？”真嗣继续想着明日香，心中疑惑。

She was obviously angry that she wasn't able to help out in anyway, but her actions had seemed different then what he had expected. Maybe he had been too nice to her? Maybe he had talked too much with her? All Shinji knew was that those last few moments spent with Asuka standing in front of the elevator, were incredibly hard for him.  
她显然因为无法以任何方式帮忙而生气，但她的行为与他预期的有所不同。或许他对她太好了？或许他跟她聊得太多了？真嗣只知道，与明日香站在电梯前的那最后几分钟，对他来说异常艰难。

He had meant what he said when he said she would be a nuisance if she came with him, but he was surprised at how persistent she had been. And those last few moments as she seemed to waver, and her feet seemed to start carrying her towards him…he was just glad that Rei had activated the elevator before she had made it to him. It was likely that she would have followed him all the way back to the command center, and would be leaning against this wall with him as they waited for the enemy to attack.  
他说她如果跟着他会是个麻烦，这话是真心的，但他惊讶于她的坚持。而她似乎犹豫不决，脚步开始向他移动的那最后几秒……他很庆幸绫波在她走到他面前之前启动了电梯。她很可能会一路跟着他回到指挥中心，然后和他一起靠在这堵墙上等待敌人进攻。

But above all else, he couldn't help but remember that brief feeling that had welled up inside him, as though a sliver of the former Shinji Ikari had broken through.  
但最重要的是，他无法忘记那种短暂涌上心头的感觉，仿佛曾经的碇真嗣的一丝痕迹破茧而出。

'After all….I suppose that I still lo-'  
'毕竟……我想我还是爱——'

Everything froze as Shinji stopped his chain of thought. He suddenly noticed several AT-fields moving to him on the other side of the gate.  
一切都在真嗣停止思绪的那一刻凝固了。他突然注意到几道 AT 力场正从大门另一侧向他移动。

'About time too,' he thought, 'I was starting to get all sentimental about my former self.'  
'终于来了，'他心想，'我差点就对自己的过去感伤起来了。'

Pushing himself off the wall, he walked over to the Gate and stood forty feet away from it with his hands in his pockets.  
他从墙边站起身，走向那扇门，在离它四十英尺远的地方停下，双手插在口袋里。

As the AT-fields converged around the gate, Shinji felt that they were placing something directly in the middle of it and wiring something together.  
当 AT 力场在门周围汇聚时，真嗣感觉到它们正在门中央放置某物，并将某些东西连接起来。

'Must be C-4,' thought Shinji as he took his right hand out of his pocket and let it hang at his side.  
‘应该是 C-4 吧，’真嗣想着，将右手从口袋里抽出，垂在身侧。

As the soldiers moved backwards, Shinji smiled slightly just as the explosion went off, pushing the metal inward and spraying metal and shrapnel inside the hallway. If anybody had been standing directly in front of it, they would have been decapitated. Shinji, who had been a good forty feet away still caught some of the debris, but everything that hit his AT-field immediately disintegrated.  
士兵们后退之际，真嗣微微一笑，就在爆炸发生的那一刻，金属被推向内，碎片和弹片喷洒在走廊内。如果有人正好站在正前方，恐怕早已身首异处。尽管真嗣距离爆炸点足有四十英尺远，仍有一些碎片击中了他，但凡是碰到他 AT 力场的碎片立刻化为乌有。

Next second though, a serious of clicks sounded and the soldiers high powered rifles went off, creating a hail of bullets that peppered the inside of the hallway. The C-4 had mainly been used as a means of disorienting the enemy, while the bullets would be used to finish them off. Of course, neither of them really had an impact on Shinji.  
紧接着，一阵咔嚓声响起，士兵们的高功率步枪开火，子弹如雨点般洒向走廊内部。C-4 炸药主要用于迷惑敌人，而子弹则用来完成最后的击杀。当然，这些对真嗣都没有造成实质性的影响。

With the breaking in finished, the first soldiers started to walk towards the large gap that had been made in the middle of the gate. Unhesitatingly, Shinji swung his right arm projecting his AT-field and cutting the gate off at the very top where the hinges normally opened it. The gate fell straight down, instantly cutting off the heads of several soldiers who were the unlucky few to be the first to enter Nerv. The others wouldn't be so quick die to the same way.  
随着破门而入的完成，第一批士兵开始向大门中央被破开的大缺口走去。毫不犹豫地，真嗣挥动右臂，展开 AT 力场，将大门从通常由铰链开启的顶部切断。大门直直坠落，瞬间斩断了几个不幸成为首批进入 NERV 的士兵的头颅。其他人则不会那么快以同样的方式丧命。

The gate now fell backwards towards the soldiers, creating something like a plank so the soldiers could walk up it and enter Nerv. Though seeing this suddenly gave Shinji an idea. Bending down, he grabbed a twist piece of metal that had been part of the door and threw it several into the air before he caught it again. Suddenly, his arm shot outwards as he flung the metal piece towards the soldiers. It struck the one in front, startling him so much that he accidentally discharged a round from his rifle which struck a buddy close to him. Shinji could even hear the hollers and screams of pain from this distance. It seemed that he had thrown the enemy into disarray, making him wonder if these were really soldiers, and not just regular policemen.  
大门此刻向后倒向士兵们，形成了一块类似木板的东西，让士兵们可以走上它进入 Nerv。然而，这一幕突然给了真嗣一个主意。他弯下腰，抓住了一块曾是门一部分的扭曲金属，将其抛向空中数次后又接住。突然，他的手臂猛地向外一甩，将金属片掷向士兵们。它击中了最前面的那个，吓得他不小心从步枪中射出了一发子弹，击中了身边的同伴。真嗣甚至能听到从这个距离传来的痛苦嚎叫和尖叫声。看来他成功地让敌人陷入了混乱，这让他怀疑这些真的是士兵，而不是普通的警察。

'I don't think its really going to be this easy though,' thought Shinji as what seemed like the leader of the group started to get his men under control.  
“不过，我不认为事情会这么简单，”真嗣心想，因为看似是领队的人开始控制住他的手下。

The soldiers seemed even more cautious now. Going in single file with four in front, the crouched down as low as they could go, and started slowly making there way up the makeshift plank.  
士兵们现在似乎更加谨慎了。他们排成单列，四人一排，尽可能低地蹲下，开始缓慢地沿着临时木板向上移动。

'Now what,' thought Shinji as he looked around as though expecting somebody to be standing there and handing him a machine gun. But of course, all he had was his AT-field to rely on.  
“现在该怎么办，”真嗣想着，环顾四周，仿佛期待有人站在那里递给他一把机关枪。但当然，他唯一能依靠的只有他的 AT 力场。

The first four soldiers reached the top of the plank, and fired a three round burst from each of their guns. Shinji reflexively deployed his AT-field, easily blocking the bullets that neared him. There was still some dust and smoke in the air from when the Gate 5 door and crashed down, but the soldiers could now see a definable enemy, and it looked like only one person.  
前四名士兵到达木板顶端，各自从枪中射出三发连击。真嗣本能地展开了他的 AT 力场，轻松挡住了逼近的子弹。门 5 号坠落时扬起的尘土和烟雾仍弥漫在空气中，但士兵们现在能看到一个明确的敌人，而且看起来只有一个人。

The four soldiers that reached the top fanned out as the ones behind them made their way up and over the plank before rolling down and looking for a suitable place for cover. Soon, Shinji was taking fire from every place but behind of him.  
到达顶端的四名士兵分散开来，后面的士兵则越过木板，滚落下来寻找合适的掩护地点。很快，真嗣从四面八方都受到了攻击，唯独背后没有。

'Shit,' he thought as he saw the situation unfolding in front of him. 'I can't let myself get boxed in.'  
“该死，”他心想，眼看着眼前的局势逐渐恶化。“我不能让自己陷入困境。”

Taking several steps back, he took the risk of not blocking any bullets for a brief instance, and brought his right arm searing downward through the air. His AT-field shot outwards, slicing a path directly on either sides of the fighting soldiers, instantly dissipating the smoke and dust that had been circulating in the air moments before. The rain of bullets stopped almost as quickly as it had started, as the soldiers witnessed the bright flash of orange in front of them. Shinji was revealed to them then, and he didn't look like a scared boy at all; he was more like a terrifying god who had descended from the heavens in order to punish the wicked. Many of the soldiers looked to the other next to them, unsure of what to do. They had heard reports that the enemy used strange and evil weapons that held enormous power to defeat there enemies, but they had never believed any of it. Now though…  
他后退几步，冒险在短暂的一瞬间不阻挡任何子弹，将右臂猛地向下划过空气。他的 AT 力场向外爆发，直接在战斗士兵的两侧劈开一条道路，瞬间驱散了之前弥漫在空中的烟尘。子弹雨几乎和开始时一样迅速地停止了，士兵们目睹了眼前的橙色闪光。随后，真嗣显现在他们面前，他看起来根本不像一个受惊的男孩；他更像是一个从天而降、为了惩罚邪恶而降临的可怕神明。许多士兵转向身边的同伴，不知所措。他们听说过敌人使用奇怪而邪恶的武器，拥有巨大的力量来击败敌人，但他们从未相信过这些。现在……

The commanding officer though of the company of soldiers didn't believe in mythical powers of any kind, and knew that it had to be a trick of some kind. Yelling at his men closest to him, he told them not to be afraid of the little boy in front of them. They had orders to kill everyone they met after all.  
指挥官虽然不相信任何神话力量，但他知道这一定是某种伎俩。他对着身边最近的士兵大喊，告诉他们不要害怕眼前的小男孩。毕竟，他们的命令是遇到任何人都要杀掉。

Shinji however heard what he had said also, and mercilessly dealt out his punishment. With a speed surpassing normal humans, his right armed turned into a blur in that brief instance, as he brought it down to attack the office. His AT-field seemed to jump from himself to the officer, so that to the soldiers watching, it looked almost like he had thrown a grenade or something. Shinji's AT-field sliced into the left wrist of the officer who had his left hand placed underneath the barrel of the gun as he held the trigger guard with his right hand. The barrel of the gun was sliced clean off along with his left hand, creating a shower of blood as he yelled with his maimed arm over his left. Squeezing off a few rounds as he tried to aim his gun at Shinji, almost all of them missed him except for one, which only managed to graze his cheek. Shinji still wasn't fazed by almost having his head taken off.  
然而，真嗣也听到了他的话，并毫不留情地施以惩罚。他以超越常人的速度，右臂在那瞬间化作模糊的残影，猛地挥下攻击军官。他的 AT 力场似乎从自身跃至军官身上，使得旁观的士兵们几乎以为他投掷了一枚手榴弹之类的东西。真嗣的 AT 力场切入军官的左手腕，当时他的左手正置于枪管下方，右手则握着扳机护圈。枪管连同他的左手被干净利落地切断，鲜血四溅，军官惨叫着，受伤的左臂横在身前。他试图瞄准真嗣开枪，几发子弹射出，几乎全部落空，仅有一发擦过真嗣的脸颊。即便差点被爆头，真嗣依旧不为所动。

Lashing outward with his AT-field again, he sliced into the upper bicep of the man's right arm this time, cutting apart the muscle so that it dangled halfway off the bone. The officer screamed in pain as he lost the feeling in his entire right arm, dropping the gun as it became too heavy for him. Blood continued pouring out of both wounds before his eyes turned upwards as the whites shown, and he passed out.  
再次向外猛烈释放 AT 力场，这次他切入了男子右臂的上臂二头肌，将肌肉撕裂至半悬于骨上。军官因剧痛尖叫，整个右臂失去知觉，手枪因过于沉重而脱手。鲜血不断从两处伤口涌出，直到他的双眼翻白，失去了意识。

All the soldiers that had seen this still had there guns pointed towards Shinji, but as Shinji looked towards each of them, they slowly started lowering their guns. As word spread from soldier to soldier that the commanding officer had been taken down in a matter of seconds by some unknown power, all the fight went out of them. Eventually, Shinji had all of them rounded up in front of them. Their guns he had taken, and just to show them a glimpse of what he was capable of, smashed them all in seconds as he crushed them with his AT-field. He told them that if they moved so much an inch, or gave any sign of fighting back, they could join the officer who seemed to have died from the blood loss. Shinji wasn't exactly pleased by the death, but if it had only taken one death to reign in the others; he supposed it was a good trade off.  
所有目睹这一幕的士兵仍然将枪口对准了真嗣，但当真嗣看向他们每一个人时，他们慢慢地开始放下枪。随着消息在士兵之间传播，指挥官在几秒钟内被某种未知力量击倒，他们的斗志逐渐消失。最终，真嗣将他们全部聚集在面前。他们的枪已被他夺走，为了向他们展示自己的能力，他用 AT 力场在几秒钟内将所有枪支粉碎。他告诉他们，如果他们移动哪怕一英寸，或者表现出任何反抗的迹象，他们可能会加入那位因失血过多而死的军官。真嗣对死亡并不完全满意，但如果只需一次死亡就能控制其他人，他认为这是一个不错的权衡。

"Now then," Shinji said as he addressed the soldiers in front of him. All of them were sitting on the ground a good ways in front of him. Shinji told them that they didn't need to bother with putting their hands behind their heads, as even if they did try to strike him, their fist would vanish before it could even reach Shinji's face.  
“那么，”真嗣对眼前的士兵们说道。他们都坐在离他相当远的地面上。真嗣告诉他们，不必费心将双手放在脑后，因为即使他们试图攻击他，拳头也会在触及真嗣的脸之前消失。

"I want to know which nation you are all from…"  
"我想知道你们都是哪个国家的…"

This wasn't a question, it was a demand, so Shinji hoped they understood.  
这不是一个问题，而是一个命令，所以真嗣希望他们能理解。

"Ger-Germany Sir," spoke one of the soldiers nearest to him.  
"德国长官，" 离他最近的一名士兵说道。

"Is that right?" asked Shinji as he looked towards the soldier. "Is everyone here from Germany?"  
"真的吗？" 真嗣转向士兵问道，"这里所有人都是来自德国吗？"

"Yes Sir…" "是的，长官……"

Shinji smiled slightly at being addressed as sir. He could get used to that.  
真嗣因被称呼为长官而微微一笑。他觉得这感觉不错，可以习惯。

"I see," mumbled Shinji more to himself than to the others.  
"我明白了，" 真嗣喃喃自语，与其说是对其他人说，不如说是自言自语。

He had somewhat guessed that the first nation to try to attack the Evangelion Units would be Germany. Germany, after all, was where Unit 02 had been manufactured and produced, so it was understandable if Germany would want their Eva Unit back. It wasn't to far a stretch to guess that they were the ones most knowledgeable about where the other Units were kept either.  
他或多或少猜到第一个试图攻击福音战士单位的会是德国。毕竟，德国是零二号机的制造和生产地，如果德国想要回他们的 EVA 单位，这是可以理解的。猜测他们对其他单位存放地的了解程度也并非牵强。

"What about the Nerv facility in Germany? What happened to it?"  
"德国的 NERV 设施呢？那里发生了什么？"

"It was stormed yesterday, but the combatants gave up without a struggle."  
"昨天还风起云涌，但交战双方却未战先退。"

"So then why go to the trouble of killing just us?"  
"那为何偏偏要费心杀我们呢？"

"I-I don't know sir. I've just a soldier after all. I-I just follow orders."  
"我、我不知道，长官。我毕竟只是个士兵，我、我只听命行事。"

Shinji could sympathize with that, because he had sort of been a soldier himself. Just blinding following the orders of someone he thought was once his father.  
真嗣对此感同身受，因为他自己也差不多算是个士兵。只是盲目地服从那个他认为曾经是自己父亲的人的命令。

"Fine, I don't have anything else to ask you."  
“好吧，我没什么要问你的了。”

As Shinji turned away from them, almost all the soldiers flinched as though they expected to die at that instance. But Shinji had no intention of doing anything of the sort. Instead, he went back to the wall he had been leaning against earlier, and folded his arms as his head dropped to his chest.  
当真嗣转身离开他们时，几乎所有士兵都畏缩了一下，仿佛他们预计会在那一刻死去。但真嗣并没有打算做任何类似的事情。相反，他回到之前靠着的墙边，双臂交叉，头垂向胸前。

The soldiers seemed to realize then that he didn't have any plans for them, and they all stood up rather confused at what they were supposed to do now. But Shinji gave them an idea nonetheless.  
士兵们似乎这时才意识到他并没有任何计划安排给他们，他们全都站起身来，颇为困惑不知现在该做什么。但碇真嗣还是给了他们一个主意。

"Why are you still sticking around here you idiots? Most people are unlike me, and won't hesitate to kill if it means prolonging their life. I don't like killing, but that doesn't mean I'm going to stand aside and let you hurt the people who are important to me. Surely most, if not all of you have a family, or somebody important to you in your lives. Don't be so eager to throw your life away just because some told you to."  
“你们这些傻瓜为什么还在这儿徘徊？大多数人不像我，为了延长生命，他们会毫不犹豫地杀人。我不喜欢杀戮，但这并不意味着我会袖手旁观，让你们伤害对我重要的人。你们当中肯定大多数人，即使不是全部，都有家人，或者生活中有重要的人。不要因为有人告诉你们这样做，就急着放弃自己的生命。”

"Then…you have somebody important to you also sir?" asked one of them, not only surprising the others but Shinji as well.  
“那么……您也有重要的人吗，先生？”其中一人问道，不仅让其他人惊讶，也让碇真嗣感到意外。

"Yes and no," he replied after a pause. "I have people who are important to me, but the difference is that I'm likely not going to see them again."  
"是也不是，" 他顿了顿回答道，"我有对我来说重要的人，但不同的是，我可能再也见不到他们了。"

"…Why is that sir?" asked the soldier, now feeling rather nervous about having a conversation with somebody who could kill them all in an instance if he felt like it.  
"……为什么这么说，先生？" 士兵问道，此刻他感到与一个随时可能因心情而将他们全部消灭的人交谈颇为紧张。

"Because the mark of death has already been placed on me," said Shinji cold heartedly. It was a matter of how easily Shinji spoke this, that made the soldiers take a few steps away from him. They all knew the risks about being in a firefight of any kind, but this fifteen year old boy had already accepted the fact that he would die soon, and didn't seem that all put off about it.  
"因为死亡的印记已经刻在我身上了，" 真嗣冷酷地说道。正是他如此轻易地说出这一点，让士兵们不由自主地后退了几步。他们都知道参与任何形式的交火都有风险，但这个十五岁的少年已经接受了即将死亡的事实，并且对此似乎并不十分在意。

"Now if you're done asking stupid questions, you'd better clear out, before I have a change of heart."  
“现在如果你问完了那些愚蠢的问题，最好趁我还没改变主意赶紧滚。”

All it took was this simple sentence to have the soldiers scrambling amongst each other as they tried to be the first one out, as if the last one out would die. But Shinji laughed silently at how quickly they had thrown away their pledge to their country.  
仅仅这一句话，就让士兵们争先恐后地挤在一起，试图第一个离开，仿佛最后一个出去就会丧命。但真嗣在心里暗笑，他们如此迅速地抛弃了对国家的誓言。

'A human is still a human after all,' thought Shinji. 'Strip away his pride and his power and he reverts back to his meek self.'  
"“人终究是人，”真嗣心想，“剥去他的骄傲和力量，他就会变回那个懦弱的自己。”

Even so though, the conversation he had had with them was rather refreshing, that is, being able to talk to other humans that he didn't know.  
即便如此，他与他们的对话还是相当令人耳目一新，也就是说，能够与自己不认识的人类交谈。

"I hope the next batch of armed forces is going to be similar," mumbled Shinji. "At this rate, I may be able to get away with only a few casualties, though I suppose that's only wishful thinking."  
“希望下一批武装力量能差不多，”真嗣喃喃自语，“照这样下去，我或许能避免太多伤亡，不过这恐怕也只是奢望罢了。”

The first group of soldiers they had sent in had been from Germany, meaning that they may be somewhat sympathetic with Nerv's cause. The next though wouldn't be like that.  
他们派出的第一批士兵来自德国，这意味着他们可能对 Nerv 的事业抱有一定同情。但接下来的就不会这样了。

"Looks like I've got a long road ahead of me," sighed Shinji as he picked up a small piece of metal, and threw it over the fallen down gate where it fell out into the open sunlight.  
“看来我还有很长的路要走，”真嗣叹了口气，捡起一小块金属，扔过倒塌的门，它随即落入外面的阳光中。

### Chapter 29: Destruction

**Well, I'm still around, even though schools started now; I'm down in California, Burbank to be exact. So updates are going be slower now, but still coming. So this is getting close to be done at least, and hopefully by Christmas it _will_ be done.  
好吧，尽管学校已经开学，我依然在这里；准确地说，我在加利福尼亚州的伯班克。所以更新会变慢，但仍会持续。这样一来，故事接近尾声了，希望能在圣诞节前完成。**

---

Shinji didn't know how many waves of enemy soldiers he had been through, only that he had lost track at about seven.  
真嗣不知道自己经历了多少波敌军士兵，只知道大约在第七波时，他已经记不清了。

As he had predicted, the soldiers after the German group were less sympathetic towards Nerv; some even seemed to take pleasure in what they had been assigned to do, but Shinji quickly corrected that mentality.  
正如他所预料的，紧随德国小组的士兵们对 Nerv 的同情心较少；有些人甚至似乎对他们被指派的任务感到愉悦，但真嗣很快纠正了这种心态。

The total number of casualties had reached double digit numbers, and that was all Shinji knew. At one point, he had been forced to dismember each soldier in this one company that attacked him, killing many of them from blood loss. That fight alone had probably netted over ten deaths. He wasn't proud of what he had to do, however, he didn't regret the decision either. It was either him or them after all.  
伤亡总数已达到两位数，这是真嗣所知的全部。有一次，他被迫肢解了攻击他的一个连队的每个士兵，许多人因失血过多而死。那场战斗可能造成了十人以上的死亡。他并不为自己不得不做的事情感到自豪，然而，他也不后悔这个决定。毕竟，不是他死就是他们亡。

Since his first battle with the German soldiers, Gate 5 had turned into something similar to the remnants of a bomb shelter during World War II. The actually gate had been completely blown apart during one of the attacks, and Shinji still wasn't sure how it had happened. The metal floor which had once been shiny, now had two inches of dust coating the top of it, while rock and metal lay above the two inches. Bullet holes were numerous along the walls and ceiling, with the casings spent by the soldiers littered the floor in front of the gaping hole that admitted them. The entire air was choked with dust and smoke, making it increasingly harder to breathe for both Shinji, and the soldiers, but they at least could use oxygen masks if necessary.  
自从与德国士兵的首次交锋以来，五号门便沦为了类似二战时期炸弹避难所的废墟。实际上，大门在一次袭击中被彻底炸毁，真嗣至今仍不确定那是如何发生的。曾经光亮的金属地板，如今覆盖着两英寸厚的尘埃，其上散落着岩石与金属碎片。墙壁和天花板上密布着弹孔，士兵们用过的弹壳散落在入口处的大洞前。空气中弥漫着尘埃和烟雾，使得真嗣和士兵们的呼吸愈发困难，但至少在必要时他们可以使用氧气面罩。

Shinji himself was starting to grow weary. He had not been hit at all yet, but he had several grazes, and even more near fatal hits. Even if he was hit though, he would always just regenerate the damaged tissue, but it was more a problem with losing his concentration after he was hit. He could handle two, maybe three bullets, but if he turned into something like the wall behind him, he didn't think any amount of time could regenerate the destroyed tissue.  
真嗣自己也渐渐感到疲惫。他至今未被击中，但身上有多处擦伤，还有更多差点致命的攻击。即便被击中，他也能再生受损的组织，但被打中后失去集中力才是更大的问题。他可以应付两三发子弹，但如果变成身后那堵墙那样，他不确定任何时间能再生被摧毁的组织。

He had just finished fighting another wave of enemy soldiers, these men being extremely determined it seemed to break through past him. He guessed that the word was that he was starting to get tired, which was unfortunately becoming true.  
他刚刚结束又一波敌兵的战斗，这些人似乎极其坚决要突破他。他猜想消息已经传开，他开始感到疲倦，不幸的是这正逐渐成为事实。

Leaning against a tattered wall, he wiped some of the sweat off his brow before sinking down to the ground, stretching his legs out before him.  
他靠在一堵破败的墙上，擦去额头上的汗水，然后坐到地上，伸直双腿。

He really didn't know how many more of these he could handle; each one was becoming more and more difficult, and the soldiers seemed to be figuring out ways of combating him. He was only a fifteen year old kid after all, and going up against people that could hit an apple at two hundred yards away.  
他真的不知道还能应付多少次这样的情况；每一次都变得越来越困难，而士兵们似乎也在不断找出对付他的方法。毕竟他只是个十五岁的孩子，要面对那些能在两百码外击中苹果的人。

'I knew it wouldn't be easy, but this is starting to wear me down,' he thought while picking up several stones and throwing them towards the gaping hole that used to be Gate 5.  
'我知道这不会容易，但这开始让我感到疲惫，'他一边想着，一边捡起几块石头，朝曾经是 5 号门的大洞扔去。

He sat in this spot every time he defeated another wave of enemies, and always wondered how the other parts of Nerv were doing. Gates 5 and 6 weren't far apart, and if he suddenly had enemies shooting behind and in front of him, he wouldn't last long. He had no way of contacting Misato or the others in the command center, but she had trusted him to do what he saw fit, so it was unlikely she would contact him.  
每次击败另一波敌人后，他都会坐在这个地方，总是好奇 NERV 的其他部分情况如何。5 号门和 6 号门相距不远，如果突然间前后都有敌人射击，他撑不了多久。他无法联系美里或指挥中心的其他人，但她信任他，让他自行判断，所以她不太可能联系他。

During these times though, he found that his mind didn't really drift towards Asuka, as much as it surprised himself. Maybe it was because he knew that she was in such a closed off area; that he had no chance of seeing her again and that it was altogether pointless to think of her. This brought some peace to his mind though, because it let him focus on what he had to do.  
然而在这些时刻，他发现自己的思绪并没有过多地飘向明日香，尽管这让他自己都感到惊讶。或许是因为他知道她身处一个封闭的区域；他再也没有机会见到她，而且想念她也是徒劳无功的。尽管如此，这却给他的心灵带来了一丝平静，因为它让他能够专注于自己必须做的事情。

Picking up another stone, he was about to throw it towards the gaping hole when he paused suddenly. Was he imagining it, or was the ground shaking slightly?  
他捡起另一块石头，正准备朝那个敞开的洞口扔去，却突然停了下来。是他想象出来的吗，还是地面真的在微微震动？

Sitting up now, he placed a hand against the ground and waited for a few seconds. He was almost certain this time. He could feel the slight shifting of the powdery dust that coated the top of the metal flooring. As he looked to his left and right now, he saw that the small pieces of rock and metal seemed to be vibrating slightly.  
他现在坐起身来，将手放在地面上，等待了几秒钟。这次他几乎可以肯定了。他能感觉到覆盖在金属地板表面的粉尘微微移动。当他向左右看去时，他发现那些小石块和金属碎片似乎在轻微振动。

'What is that?' thought Shinji.  
'那是什么？' 真嗣心想。

He didn't feel anybody approaching him, which made him wonder if something hadn't happened somewhere else in Nerv. But why would the floor be vibrating, unless something happened underneath Nerv? But that was a dumb thought, they shouldn't have been able to penetrate into Terminal Dogma this quickly. It hadn't even been an hour since the initial attack.  
他并未感觉到有人接近，这让他怀疑 NERV 的某个地方是否发生了什么。但地板为何会震动，除非是 NERV 下方发生了什么？但这想法太愚蠢了，他们不应该这么快就能渗透到最终教条区。距离最初的攻击甚至还没过去一小时。

'Then what the hell is it?' he thought again.  
'那它到底是什么鬼东西？' 他又想了一遍。

But all at once, it stopped, as suddenly as it had started.  
但突然间，它停止了，就像开始时那样突如其来。

Shinji waited a few more seconds for the vibrating to start back up, but when it didn't, he stood up and kicked a rock to relieve some of the tension built up in him. For a brief instance, he had thought it had been an Evangelion.  
真嗣又等了几秒钟，期待震动再次开始，但当它没有发生时，他站起身来踢了一块石头，以缓解体内积聚的紧张感。有那么一瞬间，他以为那是架 EVA。

"Stupid," he mumbled as he shook his head.  
“真蠢，”他喃喃自语，摇了摇头。

Brushing the dust that had landed on his pants off, he walked over to the large hole in the wall and looked out.  
他拍去裤子上的灰尘，走向墙上的大洞，向外望去。

Tokyo-3 looked like a ghost town now, and Shinji wouldn't have been surprised to see a tumble weed go by like in those old westerns. The city had been evacuated, but that didn't seem to stop Seele. Many of the large skyscrapers had gaping holes in them from missile strikes, and some of them were on fire. Shinji didn't see the point of destroying the city if the inhabitants had left, but if it distracted them for a bit, he supposed he was thankful.  
东京-3 现在看起来像座鬼城，真治甚至觉得会像那些老西部片里一样，有风滚草滚过。城市已经疏散，但这似乎并未阻止 Seele 的行动。许多摩天大楼因导弹袭击而留下巨大的窟窿，有些还在燃烧。真治不明白既然居民已撤离，为何还要摧毁城市，但如果这能分散他们的注意力，他觉得还是值得感激的。

Turning away from the ruin of Tokyo-3, he started walking back inside the remains of Gate 5's terminal when he felt a large number of AT-fields approaching him again. They seemed to be moving fast, making him guess that they wouldn't be on foot this time.  
他转身离开东京-3 的废墟，正要走回第 5 闸口终端的残骸时，感觉到大量 AT 力场正向他逼近。它们移动迅速，让他猜测这次对方不会是徒步而来。

'The holes too small though, they can't fit a vehicle in here though,' thought Shinji with a frown on his face.  
"'这些洞口太小了，车辆根本进不来，' 真嗣皱着眉头想道。

But then he felt and saw something else. What he felt was the vibrations again, except that this time, he saw what was making them, and he had to hold back a sudden laugh that threatened to surge of his throat. Really, that half-hearted wish was really just a joke, but he was rather thrilled that they were taking him so seriously.  
"但随后他感觉到了别的东西，也看到了。他感受到的是震动，只是这次，他看到了震动的源头，不得不强忍住差点从喉咙里爆发出来的笑声。说真的，那个半心半意的愿望其实只是个玩笑，但他相当兴奋他们竟然如此认真对待。

Standing in front of Gate 5, he looked down the road where several large trucks filled with heavily armed men drove toward him, all grim faced and not joking. Behind them, however, was what had made him almost laugh.  
站在 5 号门前，他沿着道路望去，几辆载满全副武装士兵的大型卡车正朝他驶来，个个面色凝重，毫无玩笑之意。然而，在他们身后，却是让他几乎笑出声的东西。

As the convoy of soldiers neared Shinji, he saw the thing behind them take aim at the entrance to Nerv. He rather doubted that they had even spotted him yet, thinking to bury him with the first shot if possible. There conceitedness would be their undoing.  
当士兵的车队接近真嗣时，他看到他们身后的东西瞄准了 NERV 的入口。他相当怀疑他们是否已经发现了他，心想如果能用第一枪将他埋葬就再好不过了。他们的自负将成为他们的致命伤。

Shinji saw the flash, and very briefly the smoke as it discharged from the barrel before he swung his right arm downward, projecting his AT-field in front of him and shielding him from the blast. The tank shell struck his AT-field dead on, exploding behind and to the left and right. The buildings on either side got hit by shrapnel as the shell exploded, shattering windows and ripping apart several cloth awnings. The blast radius exploded outward by ten feet, with Shinji being in the center. Asphalt was thrown up into the air as the explosion left a hole in the pavement. Hot smoke was blown right into Shinji's face, searing his skin and blinding him momentarily. Knowing what would come next, he braced himself as he felt the AT-fields of the soldiers approaching him preparing to fire.  
真嗣看到了闪光，以及枪管发射时短暂冒出的烟雾，他随即向右挥动手臂，在他面前展开 AT 力场，挡住了爆炸。坦克炮弹正中他的 AT 力场，在他身后及左右两侧爆炸。两侧的建筑被弹片击中，窗户粉碎，几块布制遮阳篷被撕裂。爆炸半径向外扩展了十英尺，真嗣位于中心。沥青被抛向空中，爆炸在路面上留下了一个坑洞。热烟直接吹向真嗣的脸，灼伤了他的皮肤，使他暂时失明。知道接下来会发生什么，他做好了准备，感觉到接近他的士兵们的 AT 力场正在准备开火。

Small arms fire erupted from both the trucks that neared him, but of course the bullets vaporized the second they hit Shinji's AT-field. With the smoke from the tank shell starting to clear from a sea breeze coming from the Sea of Japan, Shinji could clearly see what he was up against. The tank that had fired at him was starting to move closer now, and seemed to be preparing for another shot. Knowing that he didn't have long, Shinji quickly ran out from the smoke and charged at the two oncoming trucks. His intention was to make it so the tank wouldn't fire at friendly targets, but either the gunner of the tank was not of the same nationality as the people in the trucks, or he simply didn't care.  
两辆逼近的卡车同时喷出小型武器的火舌，但当然，子弹一触及真嗣的 AT 力场便瞬间汽化。随着来自日本海的微风开始驱散坦克炮弹的硝烟，真嗣清晰地看到了他所面对的局势。向他开火的那辆坦克正开始移动得更近，似乎准备再次射击。意识到时间紧迫，真嗣迅速从烟雾中冲出，直奔迎面而来的两辆卡车。他的意图是让坦克无法瞄准友军目标，但要么是坦克的炮手与卡车里的人国籍不同，要么他根本不在乎。

The barrel of the tank recoiled as another round exploded out of it, firing straight at Shinji and one of the trucks. Swearing within his own mind, Shinji did something which he had wanted to try, but never had the time for it. He didn't know what the AT-field was made out of, only that it seemed to be a mass of raw energy that could not be measurable. What it did seem though, was that it had a certain density to it, because of the mass of energy. Using his AT-field as something like a spring board, he managed to jump over the hood and windshield of the truck, before hitting the top of it and rolling painful across the top before he hit the hard pavement. Rolling over, he put everything he had into his AT-field before the shell struck it.  
坦克的炮管在又一发炮弹轰然射出时后坐，直奔真嗣和其中一辆卡车。真嗣在心中咒骂，做了一件他一直想尝试却从未有机会的事。他不知道 AT 力场由什么构成，只知道它似乎是一种无法衡量的原始能量。不过，它确实表现出一定的密度，这归因于能量的质量。他利用自己的 AT 力场作为跳板，成功跃过卡车的引擎盖和挡风玻璃，然后在车顶上痛苦地翻滚，最终重重地摔在坚硬的路面上。翻滚起身，他将所有力量注入 AT 力场，就在炮弹击中之前。

His AT-field expanded so that it reached both the right and left sides of the roads before the shell struck it. The explosion happened, inches away from Shinji's face this time, instantly giving him third degree burns from the burning hot smoke that hit his face. Another crater was created in the middle of the road, flinging asphalt in all directions.  
他的 AT 力场扩张开来，触及道路的两侧，就在炮弹击中之前。爆炸发生，这次距离真嗣的脸仅几英寸，瞬间让他面部遭受三度烧伤，灼热的烟雾直扑而来。道路中央又炸出一个弹坑，沥青碎片四处飞溅。

Wincing painfully as his burns started healing, Shinji heard the squeal of tires as the trucks he had evaded turned around to chase after him again.  
伤口在愈合中痛苦地抽搐，真嗣听到轮胎摩擦地面的尖锐声响，那些他刚刚避开的卡车正调头再次追来。

'You think they'd be more grateful after I just saved their asses,' thought Shinji angrily.  
‘我刚救了他们一命，他们应该更感激些才对。’真嗣愤怒地想。

Forcing himself to stand up, he started running at the tank, getting closer all the while. The gunner seemed to realize that he wouldn't be able to ready another shell, because he opened up with the machine gun that was placed alongside the main gun. Easily destroying the bullets, Shinji continued racing towards the tank while all the while he heard the screech of tires behind him. It was the one situation he didn't want to find himself in. If they started firing behind him, then he would have to create a dome like AT-field to protect himself with. But then they could attack him on all sides and whittle him down. He couldn't let that happened.  
他强迫自己站起来，向着坦克冲去，距离越来越近。炮手似乎意识到无法及时装填下一发炮弹，于是启动了主炮旁的机枪开始扫射。真嗣轻松击毁子弹，继续向坦克疾驰，同时身后轮胎的尖叫声不绝于耳。这是他最不想陷入的局面。如果他们在背后开火，他就必须创造一个类似 AT 力场的护盾来保护自己。但那样一来，他们可以从四面八方攻击他，逐渐削弱他的防御。他绝不能让这种情况发生。

Now close enough to the tank, he brought his right arm down, slicing off the barrel of the main gun with his AT-field, which sliced it like butter. Running along the side of the tank now, he was able to ignore the machine gun which couldn't hit him now. Swinging his arm again, he sliced apart the treads of the tank so that it couldn't move. He didn't want to kill the people that were inside, but he didn't want them able to attack him either. Using his AT-field in a similar way as he had used it to jump over the truck, he jumped on top of the tank and slammed his AT-field against the hatch of the tank, making the metal crumple like paper. The soldiers were trapped in there now.  
现在距离坦克足够近，他挥下右臂，用 AT 力场如切黄油般切断了主炮的炮管。沿着坦克侧面疾跑，他无视了那无法击中他的机枪。再次挥动手臂，他切断了坦克的履带，使其无法移动。他不想杀死里面的人，但也不希望他们能攻击他。以类似跳过卡车时使用 AT 力场的方式，他跃上坦克顶部，用 AT 力场猛击坦克舱盖，使其金属像纸一样皱缩。士兵们现在被困在里面了。

Sliding down the front of it, he paused briefly as a rain of bullets hit his AT-field from the trucks which were almost to him, before turning to the machine gun left. It was so small that it melded right into the metal plating of the tank. Shinji felt rather sorry for what he was going to do, and hoped that whoever was inside wouldn't be too badly injured, because next second, he sliced apart the metal plating that housed the gun clean apart, creating a large hole that somebody may be able to squeeze through. Hearing a brief shriek of pain, Shinji knew that somebody had likely just lost a hand, but he didn't have time to dwell on the subject.  
他从坦克前部滑下，短暂停顿了一下，因为一阵子弹雨从几乎逼近他的卡车射向他的 AT 力场，然后转向留下的机枪。它太小了，完美地融入了坦克的金属装甲中。真嗣对自己即将要做的事情感到有些抱歉，并希望里面的人不会受太重的伤，因为下一秒，他将容纳机枪的金属装甲干净利落地切开，创造出一个可能有人能挤过的大洞。听到一声短暂的痛苦尖叫，真嗣知道可能有人刚刚失去了手，但他没有时间深思这个问题。

Behind him, the trucks had reached him, and were pounding the tank with bullets. Jumping back on top the tank, Shinji blocked more bullets before he slid down the other side and crouched down briefly behind the tank to catch his breath. He had never noticed it much before now, but he supposed that his physical attributes had been enhanced significantly because of his awakening as an angel. He certainly never could or _would_ do any of the crazy things he just did if he was a normal human, even with being the pilot of an Evangelion.  
在他身后，卡车已经到达，正用子弹猛烈攻击坦克。真嗣跳回坦克顶部，挡住更多子弹，然后滑到另一侧，短暂蹲在坦克后面喘口气。他以前从未特别注意到，但他猜想，由于他作为天使的觉醒，他的身体属性已经显著增强。他当然不可能也不会做任何他刚才做的疯狂事情，即使他是 EVA 的驾驶员。

Knowing that the soldiers would most likely be exiting the truck right about now, he looked around one side of the tank and had to pull his head back as several rounds ricocheted off the side of the metal plating.  
知道士兵们很可能现在正从卡车里出来，他朝坦克的一侧望去，随即不得不迅速缩回头，因为几发子弹从金属装甲侧面反弹开来。

'Damn it,' he thought briefly, before dashing along the other side, simultaneously creating his AT-field. He startled the soldier in front which seemed to be the company officer. Shattering the gun of the officer, he proceeded to slice off both his fore and index fingers before continuing on.  
‘该死，’他短暂地想了一下，然后沿着另一侧疾跑，同时展开了他的 AT 力场。他吓到了前面的士兵，似乎是连队军官。他击碎了军官的枪，接着切掉了他的拇指和食指，然后继续前进。

Hearing the shrill cry of their leader, every soldier converged on that one side of the tank. The soldiers crawled over the broken down tank and pointed their guns down the other side, only to find their office down on his knees with blood dripping out of his destroyed fingers. White bone was sticking out of the stubs, and the ends were laying on the ground in an increasing pool of blood.  
听到他们首领的尖叫声，所有士兵都聚集到了坦克的那一侧。士兵们爬过破损的坦克，将枪口指向另一侧，却只看到他们的军官跪在地上，血从被毁的手指中滴落。白色的骨头从残肢中突出，断端散落在逐渐扩大的血泊中。

"Find that bastard!" he shrieked at the men surrounding him.  
"找到那个混蛋！" 他对围在身边的士兵尖叫道。

Suddenly from behind them, the sound of nails on a chalk board was heard as one of the trunks was split cleanly in two with a flash of orange. In between the large gap created from the severed truck, only half of Shinji's face could be seen. To the soldiers who witnessed this scene, he looked like a demon.  
突然，从他们身后传来指甲划过黑板般的刺耳声响，一个箱子被橙光一闪干净利落地劈成两半。在从被切开的箱子间的大缝隙中，只能看到真嗣半张脸。对目睹这一幕的士兵们来说，他看起来像一个恶魔。

"Throw down your guns and I'll spare you," Shinji spoke in a voice he hoped sounded menacing, because he was reaching the end of his stamina.  
"放下你们的枪，我就饶你们一命，" 真嗣用一种他希望听起来很凶狠的声音说道，因为他已经快到极限了。

"Don't listen to him!" screamed the officer while cradling his bloody hands. "He's almost gotta be close to-"  
"别听他的！" 军官抱着血淋淋的双手尖叫道，"他差不多快要……"

But his words were cut off as the second truck was sliced apart. Shinji was also reaching the end of his patience.  
但他的话被第二辆卡车被切开的轰鸣声打断了。真嗣的耐心也快到极限了。

"I could kill you all in a mere instance if I want, but I'm giving you a chance to surrender. I destroyed that tank you brought along with you, even though it seemed like the gunner didn't care whether you lived or died. You say that I'm close to getting tired? Does this look like the work of somebody who's getting tired? I could go on doing all day!"  
"如果我想，我可以在瞬间杀死你们所有人，但我给你们一个投降的机会。我毁掉了你们带来的那辆坦克，尽管炮手似乎并不在乎你们的生死。你说我快累了吗？这看起来像是快要累的人做的事吗？我可以一整天都这样继续下去！"

Shinji hoped this was believable, because in truth, he was lying between his teeth. It was getting difficult just standing up. The shell shock from the tank's shell seemed to have hit him, making it difficult from him to see straight or walk straight.  
真嗣希望这听起来可信，因为事实上，他正在满口谎言。仅仅是站着就已经很困难了。坦克炮弹的冲击似乎击中了他，使他难以看清前方或直线行走。

"Don't believe him," said the officer, but with much less certainty this time.  
“别信他，”军官说道，但这次语气中少了许多确定性。

Shinji laughed at that. 真嗣对此笑了笑。

"Do you know how many stubborn officers I've put down today because they thought I was getting weary? I don't think you want to make that same mistake...do you?"  
"你知道我今天因为那些固执的军官以为我疲惫不堪而制服了多少人吗？我想你不会想犯同样的错误...对吧？"

Shinji seemed to have gotten his point across, because next second, the officer told his men to throw down their guns. Shinji walked around the other side of the destroyed trucks then, and crushed the guns that they had thrown down with his AT-field. Then he told them that if they wanted, they could try and rescue the men trapped in the truck, but it seemed that he had been right about two different groups belonging to different nationalities. They had simply met and forged a brief alliance to try and kill him. If they had actually coordinated there attack, it might have worked.  
似乎真嗣已经把他的意思传达清楚了，因为下一秒，那名军官就命令他的手下放下枪。真嗣绕到被毁卡车的另一侧，用他的 AT 力场碾碎了他们丢下的枪。然后他告诉他们，如果愿意，他们可以尝试救援被困在卡车里的人，但他之前关于两支不同国籍的队伍只是短暂结盟试图杀死他的猜测似乎是正确的。如果他们真的协调了攻击，或许就能成功。

After making sure that every last one of them didn't have any other weapons on them, Shinji ordered them to walk in the opposite direction and to not turn back until they found friendly allies. Himself, he started walking in the opposite direction also, back to the remains of Gate 5. He was exhausted. He had said he'd rather wish that they'd drive a tank through the gate, but he never thought they'd actually try it.  
在确保他们每个人都没有其他武器后，真嗣命令他们朝相反方向走，直到找到友军为止，不要再回头。他自己也朝相反方向走去，返回第五门的废墟。他筋疲力尽。他曾说过宁愿他们开着坦克冲进大门，但从没想过他们真的会尝试。

Walking back under the Gate 5 terminal which resembled a bombed out shelter, he leaned against the wall for a minute so that he could regain his equilibrium. He didn't know why it had taken the shell shock so long to settle in. Maybe it was because of the adrenaline that was likely pumping through his body, but he didn't know.  
走在宛如被炸毁避难所的 5 号门终端下，他靠在墙上休息了一会儿，以便恢复平衡。他不知道为什么冲击感过了这么久才袭来。也许是因为体内可能正在涌动的肾上腺素，但他也不确定。

"I suppose I have to say farewell to this place now," mumbled Shinji. He knew that if he continued, the last fight here would likely be his last. He needed to regain his energy, and more importantly, find out what was happening elsewhere.  
“我想我现在得告别这个地方了，”真嗣喃喃自语。他知道如果继续留在这里，最后一战很可能会成为他的绝唱。他需要恢复体力，更重要的是，弄清楚其他地方正在发生什么。

Pushing himself off the wall, he walked a little ways into Nerv before turning around and swinging his arm once. His AT-field sliced into the wall on either side of the entrance to the Gate 5 terminal, taking away the support beams which had been holding it in place. The ceiling started crumbling away as the weight couldn't be held anymore, eventually sending large pieces of rock and rubble cascading down until the entrance into Nerv via Gate 5 was blocked.  
他推开墙壁，走进 NERV 内部，然后转身挥动手臂一次。他的 AT 力场切入 5 号门终端入口两侧的墙壁，切断了支撑梁，这些梁原本固定着它。天花板开始崩塌，重量再也无法承受，最终大块的岩石和碎石倾泻而下，直到通过 5 号门进入 NERV 的入口被完全封堵。

"Now they really will have to drive a tank through there if they want to break through," laughed Shinji as he turned away and hurried to the Evangelions chamber.  
“如果他们真想突破，现在恐怕得开辆坦克穿过去了，”真嗣笑着转身，急忙赶往 EVA 的机库。

---

Asuka couldn't remember a time when she had been more bored...well, maybe a few times during her college days. Sometimes she had fallen asleep during the more boring classes, the Japanese ones for instance, and right now, she wished that she could fall asleep.  
明日香记不清自己何时曾如此无聊过……嗯，或许大学时代有过几次。有时候她会在更无聊的课上睡着，比如日语课，而此刻，她真希望自己能睡着。

The bunker that her and Rei in was nothing more than a giant square room, lit with florescent lights that hung from the ceiling. The walls were white, like almost everywhere else in Nerv, but it was a matter of how empty the room was. Misato's apartment was starting to look very lively right now.  
她和绫波所在的掩体不过是一个巨大的方形房间，天花板上悬挂着荧光灯照明。墙壁是白色的，几乎和 NERV 其他地方一样，但房间的空旷程度却让人印象深刻。现在，美里小姐的公寓开始显得格外有生气了。

A wooden table sat in the middle of the room, with several wooden back chairs placed around it. The wood was cheap, something that you'd see in a rundown coffee shop in the lower districts of towns. The only door in and out of the room was the one that Asuka and Rei had entered through. The door was made out of a thick metal platting, similar to that of what the plating protecting the Geofront was made out of; in fact, the entire outer casing of the room was likely coated in that material.  
房间中央摆着一张木桌，周围环绕着几把木背椅子。木材廉价，像是城镇下区破旧咖啡馆里常见的那种。房间唯一的出入口是明日香和丽进入的那扇门。门由厚重的金属板制成，类似于保护地底都市的装甲板；事实上，整个房间的外壳很可能都涂有这种材料。

Asuka herself had not chosen to sit at the table though, choosing instead a blank piece of wall on the other side of the room. The reason for this decision was because of the person sitting at the table. Rei hadn't said a word since she had spoken in the elevator, and Asuka preferred it that way. If she so much as opened her mouth, as unlikely as that sounded, Asuka would most likely hit her.  
然而，明日香本人并未选择坐在桌旁，而是选了房间另一侧的一块空白墙壁。她这样决定的原因是因为坐在桌旁的那个人。丽自电梯里说话后便一言不发，明日香更倾向于保持这种状态。如果她真的开口，尽管听起来不太可能，明日香很可能会揍她。

She hated this; this waiting without knowing what was going on. It had at least been an hour since she had-  
她讨厌这样；这种不知情下的等待。至少已经过去一个小时了，自从她——

A frown passed of her face as she thought of that boy, that stupid boy who refused her help. What did he hope to accomplish by himself? What _could_ he even accomplish by himself? Asuka didn't know what he had in mind, or whether he planned on dying or not. But she wasn't about to forgive him if he did die, and took whatever he knew about her to the grave. She couldn't accept that, knowing that he knew something about her memories, something, that for some reason, he and everyone else didn't seem to want to tell her. She even briefly wondered if the stupid First had been in on the secret.  
她眉头紧锁，思索着那个男孩，那个愚蠢的男孩，拒绝她的帮助。他究竟想独自完成什么？他又能独自完成什么呢？明日香不知道他心里在想什么，也不知道他是否打算赴死。但如果他真的死了，带着关于她的秘密入土，她是绝不会原谅他的。她无法接受这一点，知道他掌握着关于她记忆的某些事情，某些似乎出于某种原因，他和所有人都似乎不愿告诉她的秘密。她甚至短暂地怀疑过，那个愚蠢的一号是否也参与了这个秘密。

Looking over at Rei for a brief moment, she saw that the girl in question was reading a book that she seemed to have brought along with her.  
她瞥了一眼绫波，看到那个女孩正在读一本书，似乎是她随身带来的。

'Well aren't we prepared,' thought Asuka bitterly as she watched Rei turn a page of the book she was reading. Watching this socially inept person though only brought a sour taste to her mouth, because she turned her head away the next second, determined not to look at her.  
‘看来我们准备得很充分啊，’明日香苦涩地想着，看着绫波翻过一页书。看着这个社交无能的人，只让她感到一阵苦涩，因为她下一秒就转过头去，决心不再看她。

Titling her head backwards, she stared up at the ceiling and into one of the bright florescent lights. She wanted to know what the situation was above the surface, but knew that the guards stationed outside the bunker wouldn't tell her even if she begged...not that she had any intention of doing that though.  
她将头向后仰去，凝视着天花板和其中一盏明亮的荧光灯。她想知道地面上的情况，但知道驻守在避难所外的守卫们即使她哀求也不会告诉她……尽管她并没有打算这么做。

'What has come over me?' thought Asuka as the light above her flickered slightly. 'Since when have I cared about other people? Its almost like...I don't want to lose the people around me. Is that why I'm worrying about whats happening up there so much?'  
'我这是怎么了？'明日香想着，头顶的灯光微微闪烁。'我什么时候开始关心别人了？这几乎就像……我不想失去身边的人。这就是为什么我如此担心上面发生的事情吗？'

This bugged Asuka. She had been right before; she couldn't recognize herself anymore. But what had made her change then? Or maybe it had always been there deep inside her, the longing to finally find people that cared about her, and that she in turn could care about.  
这让明日香感到困扰。她之前是对的；她已经认不出自己了。但究竟是什么让她发生了改变？或者也许这种渴望一直深藏在她内心深处，渴望找到关心她的人，而她也能够去关心他们。

'But even if everyone survives all this, I'll have to move back to Germany. I'll see Misato I suppose...but some of the others...'  
“但即便所有人都挺过了这一切，我也得搬回德国。我想，我会见到美里...但其他人...”

Her mind for some reason drifted to a certain boy when she thought this, but she shook her head to clear her mind of his face.  
不知为何，当她想到这些时，脑海中浮现出某个少年的身影，但她摇了摇头，试图将他的面容从心中抹去。

'No...thats not just it,' she thought. 'But he is...'  
“不...不仅仅是这样，”她心想，“但他确实是...”

She didn't really know what he was to her...not yet at least, but she intended to find out when this was all over.  
她其实并不真正了解他对她意味着什么……至少现在还不清楚，但她打算等这一切结束后弄明白。

'Even if I have to slap his dead body back to life,' thought Asuka grimly as she folded her arms across her knees and placed her head in them, slowly drifting into sleep.  
“哪怕我得扇他的尸体让他复活，”明日香冷冷地想着，双臂环抱膝盖，将头埋进其中，渐渐陷入沉睡。

Shinji didn't run into anyone on his way to the Evangelions chamber, but he hadn't assumed he would; all non militaristic personal had taken shelter somewhere.  
真嗣前往 EVA 机库的路上没有遇到任何人，但他也没指望会遇到；所有非军事人员都已躲到某个安全的地方去了。

As he ran into the Evangelions chamber, and it opened up before him, he paused for a minute to catch his breath, his hands placed on his knees as he bent over. Looking up into the face of Unit 01, he couldn't help but feel that this was likely the last time that he would be entering it. They had been through a lot together after all.  
当他冲进 EVA 的机库，大门在他面前缓缓开启，他停下脚步，双手撑着膝盖，弯腰喘息。抬头望向零一机的面庞，他不禁感到这可能是他最后一次踏入这里了。毕竟，他们共同经历了太多。

Smiling slightly, Shinji rushed towards Unit 01, ignoring the plug suit that had been readied for him. He wouldn't need it. But as he was about to climb the long ladder that would place him in the entry plug of Unit 01, he stopped again and looked to his left. Evangelion Unit 02 stood there, its body still mangled and destroyed. Shinji had honestly forgotten about it; forgotten that Misato had wanted him to destroy it, but that he had refused her. When it came to it though, he didn't really know what he was gonna do to it, if he didn't destroy it. He could hardly carry it over Unit 01's back and fight at the same time.  
微微一笑，真嗣向零一机疾奔而去，无视了为他准备好的插入栓服。他不需要它。但就在他即将攀上通往零一机插入栓的长梯时，他又停了下来，转向左边。二号机矗立在那里，机身依旧残破不堪。真嗣确实忘记了它；忘记了美里曾要他摧毁它，而他拒绝了。然而，他并不清楚如果不摧毁它，自己究竟能对它做什么。他总不能一边扛着二号机在零一机背上，一边战斗吧。

'I'll block off the entrance before I leave,' thought Shinji, 'that way nobody will be able to enter.'  
“离开前我会封住入口，”真嗣心想，“这样就没人能进来了。”

It wasn't the best plan in the world, but he couldn't think of anything better.  
这并非世界上最完美的计划，但他也想不出更好的了。

Stepping into Unit 01's entry plug, the automatic hydraulic system pushed the entry plug into the back of Unit 01's head, and Shinji felt his synchronization with the Eva commence.  
踏入 01 号机的插入栓，自动液压系统将插入栓推入 01 号机头部，真嗣感觉到与 Eva 的同步开始了。

'_Well look at you boy, all grown up and all.'_  
'瞧瞧你这小子，真是长大了啊。'

Though seemingly impossible, Shinji choked on the LCL fluid floating around him when he heard a voice he hadn't heard in forever.  
尽管看似不可能，当听到一个久违的声音时，真嗣还是被周围的 LCL 液体呛到了。

"You! What are you doing back!"  
“你！怎么又回来了！”

'_Now thats not a very nice way of greeting the person who's helped you out so many times.'_  
“这么欢迎曾经帮过你那么多回的人，可不太礼貌哦。”

"Sorry...I just didn't expect it."  
"对不起...我只是没想到。"

'_I suppose that congratulations are in order though, for maintaining your sanity through all of this. Not many people could have accepted the fact that their the child of something like Adam, and still act as though they are human.'_  
'我想祝贺你还是必要的，毕竟在这整个过程中你保持了理智。很少有人能接受自己是亚当这样的存在的后代，还能表现得像个人类。'

"You knew about that!" shouted Shinji inside the Eva.  
"你知道这件事！" 真嗣在 Eva 里大喊道。

The voice laughed at him as it said, '_Of course I know about it, I've known about that since you were born those fifteen years ago. I was just waiting for you to learn the truth.'_  
那声音笑着对他说：'我当然知道这件事，自从你十五年前出生起我就知道了。我只是等着你自己发现真相。'

"Why didn't you ever tell me!"  
“你为什么不早点告诉我！”

'_Oh I gave hints about it as often enough as I deemed it necessary, but I was never going to come right out and tell you about it; it would have destroyed your mind. Now though, after you've experience many more things, and learned about your own powers, it was time I appeared before you again.'_  
‘哦，我给了足够的暗示，只要我认为有必要，但我从未打算直接告诉你；那会毁了你的心智。现在，在你经历了更多事情，了解了你自己的力量之后，是我再次出现在你面前的时候了。’

Shinji's anger turned to confusion.  
真嗣的愤怒转为了困惑。

"But you've never appeared before me, at least, not in a physical form..."  
“但你从未在我面前现身过，至少，不是以实体的形式……”

It almost seemed that his words had silenced the voice, but then-  
他的话似乎让那声音沉默了，但随后——

'_Not quite true as a whole, though thats not to say we've ever truly met...'_  
'并非完全真实，尽管这并不意味着我们真正相遇过...'

Shinji was even more confused by this statement.  
这句话让真嗣更加困惑了。

"Which one is it then?" he asked.  
“那么到底是哪一个呢？”他问道。

'_Not telling anything,'_ laughed the voice before it turned serious. '_Are you sure you've made the right decision though?'_  
“什么都没透露，”那个声音笑着，随后变得严肃起来。“不过，你确定自己做出了正确的决定吗？”

"What do you mean?" asked Shinji after a long pause.  
“你什么意思？”真嗣在长时间的停顿后问道。

'_Your power, your visions,'_ said the voice growing impatient. '_Are you sure you chose the right path?'_  
“你的力量，你的预见，”那个声音变得不耐烦了。“你确定自己选择了正确的道路吗？”

"Its a little late to second guess my decisions," mumbled Shinji.  
"现在才来质疑我的决定，有点晚了，" 真嗣咕哝道。

'_But at this rate you'll die.'_  
'但照这样下去你会死的。'

"You act like your worried about me."  
"你表现得好像在担心我似的。"

'_I have my reasons,'_ retorted the voice slightly cross.  
“我有我的理由。”那个声音略带恼怒地反驳道。

"I've already prepared for the fact that I'd die," said Shinji eventually. "I don't believe that I've chosen wrong, and even if I did, I wouldn't have it any different way. Everything leading up to this was fun. Every moment spent with Touji, Kensuke, Hikari, Ritsuko, Misato, Rebecca, Ayanami, and Asuka...I don't regret a moment that I've spent with them. The times we laughed, the sad times, all the times we argued; it hurts, but they're all engraved in my memory. So no, I don't regret the path that I've chosen. The only thing I regret is that I didn't get to spend more time with a lot of them." His mind specifically drifted towards Ayanami, who he had only gotten to know in these past few weeks, before they parted.  
“我已经做好了赴死的准备，”真嗣最终说道，“我不认为我选择错了，即便真的错了，我也不希望有任何改变。一路走来到现在，一切都很有趣。与铃原、肯斯克、光、律子、美里、丽贝卡、绫波和明日香共度的每一刻……我毫不后悔。那些欢笑的时刻，悲伤的时刻，所有争吵的时刻；虽然痛苦，但都深深烙印在我的记忆中。所以，我不后悔自己选择的道路。唯一遗憾的是，没能与他们中的许多人共度更多时光。”他的思绪特别飘向了绫波，他们仅在过去的几周里才真正相识，随后便分道扬镳。

The voice was silent however, as though it was pondering everything that Shinji said, but Shinji still had something else to say.  
然而，那个声音沉默了，仿佛在思考真嗣所说的一切，但真嗣还有话要说。

"So? Was that good enough for you, or should I continue?"  
"那么？这样你满意了吗，还是我应该继续？"

'_No, its fine,'_ said the voice. '_I just had to be sure you weren't second guessing yourself.'_  
'不，这样就好，'那个声音说道。'我只是得确认你没有在自我怀疑。'

"Before we continue?" asked Shinji, guessing more than what the voice was letting on.  
"在我们继续之前？" 真嗣问道，猜测着声音背后更多的含义。

'_Correct,'_ mumbled the voice, seemingly deep within its own thoughts.  
“正确，”那声音咕哝着，似乎沉浸在自己的思绪中。

"Then lets get this over with," sighed Shinji as Unit 01 activated and Shinji's eyes turned scarlet.  
“那就快点结束吧，”真嗣叹息道，随着初号机的启动，他的眼睛变成了猩红色。

---

Science fiction is just that: fiction, its not real, which is why it is improbable that a being like Shinji, and Evangelion Unit 01 could exist in the physical word. But they do, and to the soldiers that witnessed the final activation of Unit 01 and Shinji's subsequent destruction of everything that he could touch, they all felt that they had stepped into a science fiction novel. A demon seemed to have been born at that moment when Unit 01 burst forth from Nerv.  
科幻小说就是如此：虚构的，并非真实，因此像真嗣和福音战士初号机这样的存在在现实世界中是不太可能的。但他们确实存在，对于那些目睹了初号机最终激活以及真嗣随后摧毁一切他能触及之物的士兵们来说，他们都感觉自己仿佛踏入了一本科幻小说。那一刻，当初号机从 NERV 爆发出来时，似乎诞生了一个恶魔。

A large section of the pyramid like structure was sheared completely off by the giant AT-field that Unit 01 generated as it forced its way out and into the Geofront. Winds reaching speeds of eighty miles an hour were generated; entire sections of earth were torn up and tossed into the air; trees were ripped out of the soil, their roots left dandling in the wind as they were tossed across the Geofront. The steps of Unit 01 created vibrations that reached deep down into the earths crust, making it so the soldiers in the vicinity had difficulty standing upright.  
金字塔状结构的一大块被 01 号机生成的巨大 AT 力场完全切断，强行突破进入地表空间。风速达到每小时八十英里的狂风随之产生；大片土地被掀起并抛向空中；树木被连根拔起，根系在风中摇曳，被甩过整个地表空间。01 号机踏步产生的震动深入地壳，使得附近的士兵难以直立。

Looking across the battlefield, Shinji squinted as he looked for targets. A large number of helicopters were already headed towards him from the looks of it.  
环视战场，真嗣眯起眼睛寻找目标。看起来已经有大量直升机正朝他飞来。

'As if those could do anything even if I stood here and let them attack me,' he thought smugly. Though just as he was about to destroy them all with a single of swipe of Unit 01's AT-field, a familiar voice came on the radio.  
“就算我站在这里让他们攻击，那些东西也做不了什么。”他自得地想。然而，正当他准备用 01 号机的一记 AT 力场横扫摧毁所有直升机时，一个熟悉的声音通过无线电传来。

"Shinji, are you okay!" came Misato's worried voice.  
"真嗣，你还好吗！" 美里担忧的声音传来。

"Fine," replied Shinji, "How are things holding up at the other gates?"  
"还好，" 真嗣回答，"其他入口的情况怎么样？"

"Badly, all of them have been overrun, and the enemy has pushed further into Nerv. You did a good job of holding them off at Gate 5 though. I picked up a radio frequency saying that you destroyed a tank. Is that true?"  
"很糟糕，所有入口都已被攻破，敌人已经深入 NERV 内部。不过你在 5 号入口的表现很出色，我收到无线电频道的消息说你摧毁了一辆坦克。这是真的吗？"

"More or less," said Shinji, still watching the helicopters as they neared him.  
"差不多吧，" 真嗣说道，目光依旧紧随着逐渐靠近他的直升机。

"I'm very proud of you," said Misato after a short pause.  
"我为你感到非常骄傲，" 美里在短暂的停顿后说道。

"How much longer do you think you can hold them inside the facilities?"  
"你认为还能在设施内困住他们多久？"

"I'm not sure. In all honesty, there were more nations involved then we had initially thought. Its proving rather difficult to figure out how much we're up against."  
"我不确定。老实说，涉及的国家比我们最初预想的要多。要弄清楚我们面对的敌人有多少，相当困难。"

"How many have died so far?"  
"到目前为止，有多少人牺牲了？"

"Of our own? Not many surprisingly; none of the shelters have been hit yet."  
"我们自己人？出乎意料地不多；目前还没有任何避难所受到攻击。"

"Thats good," said Shinji, thinking briefly of Asuka and Rei.  
“那很好，”真嗣说道，脑海中短暂地闪过明日香和绫波的身影。

"Shinji...about Unit 02-"  
“真嗣……关于二号机——”

"I sealed off both entrances," said Shinji cutting her off. "They won't be able to get to it without several tons of plastic explosives."  
“我已经封锁了两个入口，”真嗣打断她的话，“没有几吨塑料炸药，他们是不可能接近它的。”

"I know but...thats not really a permanent means to the problem, and the ventilations ducts above are still accessible."  
"我知道，但是……这并不是解决问题的长久之计，而且上面的通风管道仍然可以进入。"

"It'll be fine," said Shinji.  
"没事的，" 真嗣说道。"

"But Shin-" "但是真-

"Sorry Misato, but I have to go."  
"对不起，美里，我必须得走了。"

"Wai-" but Shinji disconnected the connection.  
"等——" 但真嗣已经切断了通讯。"

"Right then," mumbled Shinji as Unit 01 started running towards the helicopters. Shinji even almost felt sorry for them as he brought Unit 01's right fist smashing down on top of one of them, instantly crushing the pilot into red mist. Missiles were fired from the helicopters, but Shinji didn't bother blocking them; conventional weapons had no effect against the Evangelions.  
"好吧，" 真嗣喃喃自语，初号机开始向直升机奔去。当真嗣用初号机的右拳猛击其中一架直升机，瞬间将飞行员砸成一片血雾时，他甚至几乎感到一丝歉意。直升机发射了导弹，但真嗣懒得去阻挡；常规武器对使徒无效。"

'Who's next?' thought Shinji, as Unit 01 charged forward, ripping apart the landscape as it bowled through the Geofront at sub-supersonic speeds. Generating Unit 01's AT-field, he wiped it around, slicing many of the helicopters surrounding him completely in half. He could feel the AT-fields of the enemies surrounding him slowly starting to diminish.  
“下一个是谁？” 真嗣心想，随着 01 号机向前冲锋，以亚音速的速度横扫第三新东京市的地表，撕裂着周围的一切。他生成 01 号机的 AT 力场，将其挥舞开来，将环绕四周的许多直升机齐齐斩成两截。他能感觉到周围敌人的 AT 力场正逐渐减弱。

'Is this all that they can throw at me?' wondered Shinji. He was almost worried that this would end rather quickly.  
“他们就这点能耐吗？” 真嗣暗自思索。他几乎担心这场战斗会很快结束。

Just as he thought this, an explosion happened from the far side of the Geofront as the missile batteries started launching artillery size missiles. Smiling slightly, Shinji brought Unit 01's hand behind its back and brought out the progressive knife hidden behind its left shoulder. Running directly at the missiles, Unit 01 suddenly jumped into the air to greet the missiles. Bringing the progressive knife down directly were the tip of the missile was, the progressive knife sheared the missile in half, sending raining debris down onto the terrain below.  
就在他这么想的时候，第三新东京市的远端发生了爆炸，导弹发射器开始发射炮弹大小的导弹。真嗣微微一笑，让 01 号机将手伸向背后，取出了隐藏在左肩后的高振动粒子刀。直奔导弹而去，01 号机突然跃入空中迎接导弹。将高振动粒子刀直接劈向导弹的尖端，刀刃将导弹一分为二，碎片如雨般洒落在下方的地面上。

'Next,' thought Shinji as he turned towards another of the missiles, but next second changed plans as he was assaulted by a vivid vision of the entire Geofront being engulfed in a large explosion.  
“下一个，” 真嗣想着，转向另一枚导弹，但下一秒他改变了计划，因为他被一个生动的景象袭击：整个 Geofront 被一场巨大的爆炸吞没。

Testing the limits of his and Unit 01's AT-field was not smart at this time, but he didn't have any other choice as the warhead reached him. Creating half a dome with Unit 01's AT-field, and the other half with his own, Shinji encased the warhead in the two AT-fields, just as the explosion went off.  
在此时测试他和初号机的 AT 力场极限并不明智，但他别无选择，因为弹头已经接近。真嗣用初号机的 AT 力场形成半个穹顶，用他自己的 AT 力场形成另一半，将弹头包裹在两个 AT 力场中，就在爆炸发生的那一刻。

Shinji felt as though his entire body was threatening to be ripped apart as the nuclear explosion threatened to spill out of the two AT-fields. The explosion was not as strong as it could have been though, due to the fact that the two AT-fields had absorbed most of the raw energy. As Shinji forced the two AT-fields to slowly shrink, encasing the explosion even more, the AT-fields slowly dissipated the explosion. It looked as though a miniature sun had descended into the Geofront, only to be destroyed by a larger sun.  
真嗣感觉自己的整个身体仿佛要被撕裂，因为核爆炸威胁要从两个 AT 力场中溢出。尽管由于两个 AT 力场吸收了大部分原始能量，爆炸并没有那么强烈。随着真嗣迫使两个 AT 力场缓慢收缩，进一步封装爆炸，AT 力场逐渐消散了爆炸。看起来就像一颗微型太阳降临到 Geofront，却被一个更大的太阳摧毁。

Sweating heavily from the strain it took to incase the explosion, Shinji finally dropped both AT-fields as the explosion was lost.  
由于包裹爆炸所承受的巨大压力，真嗣汗流浃背，最终在爆炸被遏制后放下了两层 AT 力场。

'Shit,' he thought, 'I can't believe those bastards actually tried setting off a nuclear explosion inside the Geofront.' The thing was, if it had been an N2 bomb, which was significantly greater than a regular nuclear warhead, he probably wouldn't have been able to stop the explosion. Be that as it may, he felt weak now, and had no idea if the radiation from the explosion would affect him at all.  
“该死，”他心想，“真不敢相信那些混蛋居然试图在 Geofront 内部引爆核弹。”问题是，如果是 N2 炸弹，其威力远超普通核弹头，他可能就无法阻止爆炸了。尽管如此，他现在感到虚弱，也不知道爆炸产生的辐射是否会影响到他。

It seemed that the explosion had also garbled radio frequencies, because he heard Misato's voice come through the intercom, but he couldn't understand a word that she was saying, only that she sounded worried. Muting the intercom though, he was just turned back to the battle when the remaining missiles struck Unit 01. Thought it did no damage to Unit 01 physically, internally, Shinji was feeling worse. Thankfully though, the remaining missiles hadn't held a warhead.  
似乎爆炸还干扰了无线电频率，因为他听到美里通过对讲机传来的声音，但一个字也听不懂，只觉得她听起来很担心。尽管他关闭了对讲机，但当剩余的导弹击中 01 号机时，他再次投入战斗。虽然导弹对 01 号机没有造成物理损伤，但真嗣感觉更糟了。幸运的是，剩余的导弹并未携带弹头。

'I have to destroy those missile batteries,' he thought.  
“我必须摧毁那些导弹电池，”他心想。

Forcing his body back under control, he briefly glanced down at his right arm. The tips of his fingers had turned slightly black from the radiation, and he couldn't move them.  
他强迫自己的身体重新受控，短暂地低头看了一眼右臂。指尖因辐射而微微发黑，无法动弹。

'I'm still human after all,' he thought as he looked at his hand. It may take some time, but he hoped that the radiation would eventually be filtered out of his system because of his angel DNA.  
“毕竟我还是人类，”他看着自己的手心想。虽然可能需要一些时间，但他希望由于天使 DNA 的存在，辐射最终能从体内被过滤掉。

But it wasn't bad, and he could still fight.  
但情况并不糟糕，他还能继续战斗。

Not waiting for the batteries to fire another round of missiles at him, Unit 01 jumped high into the air, and soared above the batteries, its shadow just above them. Like a bullet ripping through the air, Unit 01 crashed down on top of one of the batteries, instantly destroying it and the soldiers that surrounded it. The large strip of pavement that it had been resting upon was split in half, a deep crack running down the landscape of the Geofront. Swiveling around, he turned towards the other missile battery, which was slowly rotating to face him. Quickly deploying Unit 01's AT-field, it sliced directly into the missiles armed on the battery, sending off numerous explosions. Around twenty humans that were in the vicinity were instantly vaporized as the missiles exploded. A large crater was left in the ground where the explosion had happened; grass turned instantly brown as the heat wave exploded outward, looking as though it had been baking under the sun for several months. Several trees had their leaves burned off and turned to black soot that fell to the ground.  
不等电池再次发射导弹，初号机一跃而起，凌空飞越电池群，其阴影掠过它们上方。如同子弹划破空气，初号机猛然坠落在一座电池上，瞬间将其及周围的士兵摧毁。原本承载电池的宽阔路面被一分为二，一道深邃的裂缝贯穿了地下的景观。转身面对另一座缓慢转向的导弹电池，初号机迅速展开 AT 力场，直接切入电池上的导弹，引发连串爆炸。附近约二十名人类在爆炸中瞬间化为乌有。爆炸处留下一个巨大的弹坑；草地因热浪冲击而瞬间枯黄，仿佛在烈日下曝晒数月。几棵树的叶子被烧成黑灰，纷纷飘落。

Out from the dark cloud of smoke that had been issued walked Unit 01, completely unscathed from the ensuing explosion.  
从那团喷涌而出的浓烟中，初号机步履稳健地走出，丝毫未受随后爆炸的影响。

'Thats done at least,' thought Shinji as he looked around from his position in the Geofront. The missile batteries had been placed upon one of the higher ledges so that it would have a high vantage point. From here, Shinji could see everything that was happening in the Geofront, though admittedly, there wasn't much here in the realm of things that were left for him to destroy. It seemed that the large concentration of power was still above the surface, in Tokyo-3.  
'至少这一步完成了，'真嗣从地底都市的位置环顾四周，心想。导弹电池被安置在较高的岩架上，以获得良好的视野。站在这里，真嗣能一览无余地看到地底都市发生的一切，尽管坦白说，这里已经没有什么值得他摧毁的东西了。似乎大部分能量仍集中在上方的地表，即第三新东京市。

'But they had to have gotten down here somehow...'  
'但他们总得通过某种方式来到这里...'

Shinji knew of a sky elevator somewhere in the Geofront that was used for aircraft, so he figured thats how the helicopters had gotten in, and the batteries had gotten in by the normal road routes. Maybe he could use that to reach the surface easier.  
真嗣知道在 Geofront 某处有一座用于飞机的天空电梯，他猜想直升机就是通过那里进来的，而电池则是通过常规道路运输进来的。或许他可以利用那个电梯更容易地到达地面。

'Its worth a try,' thought Shinji. 'And the more time a stay battling in here, the longer I put the entire Geofront in danger.' He had already done a good amount of damaged to it as it was.  
“值得一试，”真嗣心想，“而且我在这里战斗得越久，整个 Geofront 就越危险。”他已经在不知不觉中对它造成了相当大的破坏。

---

Misato had seen the nuclear explosion that Shinji had been able to contain from the monitors in the command center, and she had instantly tried to contact him, fearing that the radiation may have adverse affects on him. But the radio frequencies had been scrambled, and even when she had tried contact him, he had muted her. She then felt relief though as she saw that he seemed to still be fine with Unit 01 moving as it was. But now though, after he had destroyed those batteries, Unit 01 was just standing there. She tried making contact with Shinji again, but it was still muted.  
美里从指挥中心的监视器上看到了真嗣成功控制住的核爆炸，她立刻试图联系他，担心辐射可能对他产生不良影响。但无线电频率被干扰了，即使她尝试联系他，他也静音了她的通讯。然而，当她看到他似乎仍然安然无恙，初号机也正常移动时，她松了一口气。但现在，在他摧毁那些电池后，初号机只是站在那里。她再次尝试联系真嗣，但通讯依旧被静音。

'Damn it,' she thought angrily at how helpless she was in a situation like this.  
“该死，”她愤怒地想着，在这种情境下自己是多么无助。

"Whats the status of the interior of Nerv?" she asked to the surrounding personal still stationed at the computers.  
“NERV 内部情况如何？”她向周围仍坚守在电脑前的个人询问道。

"Blocks one through one hundred sixty-three have been completely overrun. Shelters four, five, and six have also been hit. Estimated number of casualties have triple digit numbers."  
“1 至 163 号区块已全面沦陷。4、5、6 号避难所也遭到袭击。预计伤亡人数达三位数。”

"What about Terminal Dogma?" asked Fuyutsuki who was acting as temporary commander, since Gendo was nowhere to be found. "Have any of the elevator shafts been penetrated?"  
"终端教条区的情况如何？" 代理指挥官冬月问道，因为碇源堂不知所踪。"电梯井有没有被突破？"

"Strong defense has been placed around number three where the First and Second children are being protected. The other elevators are unknown at this time."  
"三号区域周围已加强防御，第一和第二适格者正在那里受到保护。其他电梯目前情况不明。"

"Flood the blocks that have already been taken over by the enemy with the bakelite. It should slow down their advance a little," said Fuyutsuki.  
"用泡沫塑料淹没已被敌人占领的区块。这应该能稍微延缓他们的推进速度。" 冬月说道。"

Misato bit her lip in frustration; the bakelite had always been used as a last resort sort of solution.  
美里咬着嘴唇，显得有些沮丧；这种胶木材料通常只在万不得已时才会使用。

"Fuyutsuki..." started Misato tentatively. "I think...I'm going to go see what the status is with the other elevators."  
美里试探性地开口：“副司令……我想……我去看看其他电梯的情况。”

Fuyutsuki turned around and said quite bluntly, "That would be suicide Major-"  
冬月转过身来，直截了当地说：“那无异于自杀，少校——”

"Lets quit with the discrepancies and just call each other by our names." Fuyutsuki frowned, but obeyed her anyway.  
“我们别再纠结这些差异了，直接用名字称呼彼此吧。”冬月皱了皱眉，但还是照做了。

"Fine then, Katsuragi, what do you hope to accomplish by learning the status of the other elevators?"  
“好吧，葛城，你希望通过了解其他电梯的状态来达成什么目的？”

"I don't know, but I can't just stand here and do nothing!" she shouted. Everybody in the command center was now listening to their conversation.  
“我不知道，但我不能就这样站在这里什么都不做！”她喊道。指挥中心里的每个人都开始关注他们的对话。

"You do not need to shout Katsuragi, I can hear you plainly enough, and since this is a very stressful time it would be best if you-"  
"你不需要大喊大叫，Katsuragi，我听得很清楚，而且现在压力很大，你最好……"

"Shinji's out there fighting to protect everybody, even after everyone thought he was a freak! And he's fighting all by himself!"  
"真嗣在外面为了保护大家而战斗，即使大家都曾认为他是个怪物！而且他是独自一人在战斗！"

"And what do you suppose you going to the other elevators and getting yourself killed would accomplish?" asked Fuyutsuki, getting surprisingly angry. "Do you think Shinji would appreciate the fact that you died while trying to help him?"  
"你以为你去其他电梯然后让自己送命能有什么用？" Fuyutsuki 问道，出乎意料地生气。"你认为真嗣会感激你为了帮他而死吗？"

"But we aren't doing anything-"  
"但我们什么都没做-"

"We are doing everything that we as humans can do," retorted Fuyutsuki. "We are a world apart from Shinji now, and the only thing we can do at this moment is rely on him."  
"我们正在尽人类所能做的一切，" 福木反驳道。"我们现在与真嗣已是天壤之别，此刻我们唯一能做的就是依靠他。"

Misato glared at Fuyutsuki for a second before she turned around and walked towards the elevator.  
美里瞪了福木一眼，然后转身走向电梯。

Calling after her, Fuyutsuki said, "I wont stop you Katsuragi, but at most you should go to elevator three and assist with the movement of Asuka and Rei if necessary."  
呼唤着她的背影，冬月说道：“我不会阻止你，葛城，但最多你该去三号电梯，必要时协助明日香和绫波的移动。”

Misato looked over at her shoulder, but saw that Fuyutsuki had already turned around and was staring, waiting for Unit 01 it to start moving again.  
美里回头望去，却发现冬月已经转身，正凝视着，等待初号机再次启动。

"After all," he said continuing after a brief pause, "you know those kids better than anyone else."  
“毕竟，”他顿了顿继续说道，“你对那些孩子比任何人都了解。”

"I know," replied Misato.  
"我知道，" 美里回答道。

Chuckling slightly, Fuyutsuki said, "That stubbornness is just like your father. You know, it wasn't just your life that he saved that day; he saved many of his fellow scientists at risk to his own life."  
微微一笑，冬月说："那份固执和你父亲一模一样。你知道吗，那天他不仅救了你，还冒着生命危险救了许多他的同事科学家。"

"I know," said Misato again, "and I'm quite proud of him for it."  
"我知道，" 美里再次说道，"为此我非常自豪。"

Without glancing at anyone else in the command center, she walked over to the elevator and was about to press the down button on the elevator when the doors swung open. Thinking that it might have been the enemy, she unholstered the gun at her hip and brought it up, only to have a hand grasp the top of it and point it at the ground.  
她没有看指挥中心的任何人一眼，径直走向电梯，正要按下下行按钮时，电梯门突然打开了。她以为是敌人，便迅速从腰间拔出手枪举起，却被一只手抓住枪口，将其指向地面。

"That was rather rude Major," came the jokingly comment of Kaji.  
“少校，这样做可不太礼貌啊，”加持半开玩笑地说道。

Misato didn't even bother replying as she stepped into the elevator alongside him, though when he didn't step out, she asked rather testily, "Aren't you going to get out?"  
美里连回答都懒得回答，和他一起走进电梯，但当他没有下电梯时，她有些不耐烦地问：“你不打算出去吗？”

"No, actually, I was looking for you; it seems that luck still hasn't failed me yet."  
"不，实际上，我一直在找你；看来运气还没抛弃我。"

"Lets hope it holds up for the rest of the day," said Misato as she holstered her gun. "And? So? What did you want to see me for?"  
"希望它今天都能保持，" 美里一边收起枪一边说。"然后呢？所以？你找我有什么事？"

"Just to be sure you were okay," said Kaji while shrugging.  
"只是确认你没事，" 加持耸耸肩说。"

Misato made a disgusting look with her face, but wasn't letting on how she really felt. Beside her, Kaji fished a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it.  
美里脸上露出厌恶的表情，却没有透露出她真正的感受。在她旁边，加持从口袋里掏出一支烟，点燃了它。

"Those things will be the death of you," said Misato as the elevator started descending.  
“那些东西会要了你的命的，”电梯开始下降时，美里说道。

"I don't think I'll have to wait for the cancer to take me," said Kaji as he took a puff on the cigarette.  
“我觉得我不必等到癌症来夺走我的生命，”加持吸了一口烟，说道。

Eyeing it rather evenly, Misato finally snapped at him, "Oh, give me one of those!"  
米萨托相当平静地盯着它，最终对他厉声说道：“哦，给我一支！”

Kaji raised and eyebrow but pulled another out of his pocket and lit it for her. With both of the puffing in the small elevator, the air quickly became choked with smoke.  
加持挑了挑眉，从口袋里又掏出一支并为她点燃。两人在小电梯里吞云吐雾，空气很快变得烟雾缭绕。

"I don't think I've smoked since college," said Misato, breaking the silence, "but my nerves are just..."  
“我想我自从大学后就再也没抽过烟了，”米萨托打破了沉默，“但我的神经就是……”

"You worried about Shinji?"  
"你在担心真嗣吗？"

"Of course! How could I not be. He's fighting with everything he's got, but I don't even know what I'm supposed to do right now. I'm a wreck! I kept thinking that soldiers were going to burst through the wall of the command center any second while I was there. Thinking about what Asuka's going through right now, with her mind a mess, not knowing whats going through the commander mind, and the whole idea that I might not-"  
"当然！我怎么能不担心。他正全力以赴地战斗，而我甚至不知道现在该做什么。我心乱如麻！我在指挥中心时，一直想着士兵们随时可能破墙而入。想到明日香现在心乱如麻，不知道指挥官在想什么，还有那种我可能无法……"

Kaji silently removed the cigarette from her mouth, and pressed his forefinger against her lips.  
加持默默地从她嘴里取下香烟，用食指轻按在她的唇上。

"Not. Another. Word. ...Alright?"  
"别。再。说话。……好吗？"

Misato nodded silently through her closed lips.  
美里通过紧闭的双唇默默地点头。

"Good then," said Kaji as he removed his finger from her lips, and placed the cigarette back between her lips. Though Misato hated to admit it, the feel of the cigarette between her lips had rather lost its luster, now that she had felt Kaji's warm finger touching her soft flesh.  
"那就好，" 加持说着，将手指从她的唇上移开，把香烟重新放回她的唇间。虽然美里不愿承认，但在感受过加持温暖的手指触碰她柔软的肌肤后，香烟夹在唇间的感觉已不再那么诱人。

"Hey Kaji?" "嘿，加治？"

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"Do you think I made a mistake...having Asuka and Shinji live together?"  
"你觉得我是不是做错了...让明日香和真嗣住在一起？"

Kaji was silent for a minute, before he took the cigarette out of his mouth and said very seriously, "I don't think it would have made a difference. They would have still found each other."  
加治沉默了一会儿，然后从嘴里拿出香烟，非常认真地说：“我不认为这会有什么不同。他们终究会找到彼此的。”

"...You think so?" "...你这么认为吗？"

"I do," said Kaji, looking down at this own cigarette as though it suddenly tasted bad. Dropping it to the floor of the elevator, he stamped it out with his shoe; beside him, Misato did likewise.  
"是的，" 加治说着，低头看着自己的香烟，仿佛它突然变得难以下咽。他将烟蒂丢在电梯地板上，用鞋踩灭；在他身旁，美里也做了同样的动作。

As the doors opened, and they were about to step out into the open hallway, Misato grabbed the back of Kaji shirt and slowly asked, "Can you...do me a favor?"  
当电梯门打开，他们正要踏入空旷的走廊时，美里抓住了加治衬衫的后摆，缓缓问道："你能...帮我个忙吗？"

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

"Stay by my side...till-"  
"留在我身边...直到——"

"I would have even if you didn't ask," replied Kaji with a slight smile.  
"即使你没要求，我也会这么做。" 加持微微一笑回答道。

Misato broke into her own smile, though it would be a long time before she ever smiled again.  
美里露出了笑容，尽管她知道要再次微笑还需要很长时间。

Shinji had found the sky elevator which would take him to the surface, but the only problem was how he was supposed to get that high. He had no idea either whether Unit 01 would even fit through the hole.  
真嗣找到了通往地面的天空电梯，但唯一的问题是他该如何到达那么高的地方。他也不确定零号机是否能通过那个洞口。

'But I don't have any other choices.'  
'但我没有其他选择了。'

Bending Unit 01's legs, he made it crouch so far down that its chin was in danger of touching the ground when he jumped. The ground shook as though a miniature earthquake had been set off; large pieces of dirt were thrown up into the air. Unit 01 tore through the sky as it soared upward; Shinji had actually misjudged how high Unit 01 could jump, because he was quickly at the sky elevator. Quickly generating Unit 01's AT-field, he cut off the metal door that sealed the elevator from the Geofront. Slamming Unit 01's hands into the metal siding, he was able to get an adequate foothold. Many feet above him, he could just see a crack of daylight.  
他弯曲零号机的双腿，使其蹲下到几乎下巴快要触地的程度，然后跳跃。地面震动如同引发了微型地震，大块泥土被抛向空中。零号机撕裂天空般向上飞跃；真嗣实际上低估了零号机的跳跃高度，因为他很快就到达了天空电梯。他迅速生成零号机的 AT 力场，切断了封住电梯通往地下的金属门。将零号机的双手猛击进金属侧壁，他获得了足够的立足点。在他上方很远的地方，他只能看到一线日光。

'Almost there,' he thought.  
“快到了。”他心想。

That was when it happened.  
就在那时，事情发生了。

As he started climbing, he heard the unmistakable sounds of a large airplane flying overhead; the sound of its engines funneling down into the narrow cylinder he was in. It seemed to have stopped directly over the Geofront.  
当他开始攀爬时，他听到了一架大型飞机从头顶飞过的清晰声响；引擎的轰鸣声在他所在的狭窄空间内回荡。飞机似乎就悬停在 Geofront 的正上方。

'Shit,' thought Shinji as it dawned on him then what they were likely doing, but it was too late.  
“该死，”真嗣那时才意识到他们可能在做的事情，但为时已晚。

The N2 bomb was dropped at a height of seventy-thousand feet above the city of Tokyo-3, falling at a rate of five thousand feet a second. Shinji had enough time to generate both AT-fields just before the bomb struck the crust of the earth.  
N2 炸弹在东京市上方七万英尺的高空被投下，以每秒五千英尺的速度坠落。真嗣在炸弹撞击地壳之前及时生成了两个 AT 力场。

It looked like something directly out of the Cold War; the city, already laid waste thanks to the explosion of Unit 00, was almost completely leveled. The N2 bomb struct the metal plating separating the Geofront from Tokyo-3, melting it almost instantly and ripping through the seventy some gates of reinforced steel. A giant explosion erupted into the sky; the plume cloud was so large that it blocked out the sun outward of ten miles from the epicenter. A large gaping hole had been made in the Geofront. Small pieces of twisted metal were falling from the sky, still burning as they fell to the ground. It felt as though the entire earth was shaking.  
这景象仿佛直接从冷战时期穿越而来；城市在零号机爆炸的破坏下已经满目疮痍，而 N2 炸弹的冲击几乎将其完全夷为平地。炸弹击穿了将地底都市与东京隔开的金属板，几乎瞬间将其熔化，并撕裂了七十多道加固钢门。巨大的爆炸冲天而起，烟云如此庞大以至于在离震中十英里外遮蔽了阳光。地底都市被炸出了一个巨大的缺口。扭曲的小块金属碎片仍在燃烧，从天而降。整个地球似乎都在颤抖。

In this attack on the Geofront, many nationalities lost soldiers that had been placed above the surface. The attack had come directly from Seele, organized through their Japanese contacts, so that only the Japanese knew about the impeding strike. But Seele didn't care at this point, because they were close to their objective.  
在这场对 Geofront 的袭击中，许多国家的士兵在地面之上失去了生命。这次攻击直接来自 Seele，通过他们在日本的联系人组织，因此只有日本人知晓即将到来的打击。但 Seele 此时并不在意，因为他们已接近目标。

Unit 01 had taken the explosion head on, and though it was able to minimize some of the damage, thanks to both Shinji's and its AT-fields, it still suffered considerable damaged. Most of the metal plating had been completely melted off; the top part of the Evangelion looked almost naked, while the bottom half still retained most of the metal plating. Blood poured out of both arms of the Evangelion as it had taken the strain of maintaing the AT-field.  
初号机正面承受了爆炸，尽管得益于真嗣和其 AT 力场的保护，减少了部分损伤，但仍遭受了相当程度的破坏。大部分金属装甲已完全熔化；EVA 的上半部分几乎赤裸，而下半部分仍保留着大部分金属装甲。EVA 的双臂不断流出鲜血，因为它承受了维持 AT 力场的巨大压力。

Shinji was little better off; large sections of his skin had been completely peeled off, revealing the red muscles underneath. Blood poured forth from his arms, and around certain parts of his face. His fingernails had been torn off, while the ends of his finger seemed to have been completely eroded away, leaving white bone sticking out. But the pain didn't bother Shinji; he was too used to it by now.  
真嗣的状况也好不到哪儿去；他身上大片皮肤被完全剥离，露出下面的红色肌肉。鲜血从他的双臂和面部某些部位涌出。他的指甲被撕裂，指尖似乎已被完全侵蚀，露出白色的骨头。但疼痛对真嗣来说已不算什么；他早已习惯了。

'Those bastards,' he thought bitterly, as a trickle of blood bubbled at the corner of his mouth before bursting and started flowing down the side of his face. His normally white shirt was already dyed in blood.  
“那些混蛋。”他痛苦地想着，一丝血从嘴角冒出，随即破裂，顺着脸颊流下。他平日洁白的衬衫早已染上了血迹。

The sky elevator that Unit 01 had been in was likewise destroyed, so that Unit 01 was falling back down into the Geofront. But at least now Shinji didn't have to worry about finding a way to the surface.  
零号机所在的天梯同样被摧毁，使得零号机坠回地底都市。但至少现在真嗣不必担心如何回到地面了。

Unit 01 crashed back to the bottom of the Geofront, its feet crashing into the soil and splitting the ground, creating a large chasm. But Shinji had only eyes for the earth above him. Squinting through the darkened sky to the world above, he had Unit 01 crouch down again before it leapt upwards.  
零号机重重地坠回地底都市底部，双脚踏入土壤，地面裂开，形成一道巨大的裂缝。但真嗣眼中只有头顶的地面。透过昏暗的天空望向地表，他让零号机再次蹲下，随即一跃而起。

The pressure was unbelievable as Shinji was thrown backwards into the pilot seat, as the change in G's threatened to tear his body apart. Shinji's blood started to mix with the LCL fluid inside the entry plug, almost turning the fluid red. His eyes continued to glow red, and his bodies cells were already starting to repair the damage.  
压力之大令人难以置信，真嗣被猛地甩向驾驶座，G 力变化仿佛要将他的身体撕裂。真嗣的血液开始与插入栓内的 LCL 液体混合，几乎将液体染成红色。他的眼睛继续闪烁着红光，身体细胞已经开始修复损伤。

Unit 01 rocketed upward before it passed outside the Geofront, and up into the skies of Tokyo-3. As Shinji floated airborne in Unit 01 for a few seconds, he was able to see the damage done by the N2 bomb; everything was barren and brown. The tops of skyscrapers littered the ground; twisted pieces of cars lay scattered across the landscape; the asphalt of the road ways had turned liquid hot, so that the tar bubbled upward. Shinji saw all this and more, because he then saw a large group of ships far off in the distance in the Sea of Japan. Boiling hatred the likes of which he had never known erupted within him as Unit 01 tumbled back towards the ground.  
初号机如火箭般冲天而起，穿过地表，直上东京三区的天空。真嗣在初号机中悬浮了几秒，得以目睹 N2 炸弹造成的破坏；一切都是荒凉的棕色。摩天大楼的顶端散落一地；扭曲的汽车残骸遍布四周；道路的沥青已化为滚烫的液体，沥青向上冒着泡。真嗣看到了这一切，甚至更多，因为他随后看到远处日本海上有一大群舰船。一股他从未体验过的沸腾仇恨在他心中爆发，初号机随之翻滚着坠向地面。

'Those bastards,' he thought again. His eyes boiled blood red, the LCL fluid inside the entry plug seemed to boil along with Shinji's hatred, and Unit 01 reacted to that. The hinges clamping its mouth closed broke loose as it released an ear splitting roar, shattering the glass that had not been destroyed when the bomb had hit. The roar of Unit 01 was heard as far away as Tokyo-2. The waves in the Sea of Japan increased with intensity as though listening to Unit 01. The men on the ships heard the roar and were filled with a fear and a sudden wish to be back at home.  
“那些混蛋，”他再次暗想。他的双眼血红如沸，插入栓内的 LCL 液体似乎随着真嗣的仇恨一同沸腾，初号机对此做出了反应。紧闭的嘴部铰链断裂，发出震耳欲聋的咆哮，将炸弹击中时尚未破碎的玻璃尽数震碎。初号机的吼声远至东京-2 都能听见。日本海上波涛汹涌，仿佛在回应初号机。船上的士兵们听到这吼声，心中充满了恐惧，突然渴望回到家中。

Unit 01 turned towards the enemy, its eyes narrowing as it did so; its thoughts that of Shinji's, and only one thing resonated in its mind: destroy everything.  
初号机转向敌人，双眼随之眯起；它的思维与真嗣同步，唯有一念在脑海中回响：毁灭一切。

Unit 01 broke the sound barrier as it rushed towards the ships, creating a sonic boom which kicked up dust and debris. It was moving so fast, that it looked like a blur. As it reached the edge of the shore, it suddenly jumped, flying over the fishing boats which had been left abandoned to the sea. Flying over the wide expanse of the sea, it came crashing down on one of the aircraft carriers out in the water. Without even changes positions, Unit 01 generated its AT-field behind itself, slicing the control tower of the aircraft carrier off so that it fell into the water.  
初号机突破音障，疾驰向舰队，激起的音爆扬起尘土和碎片。其速度之快，宛如一道模糊的影子。抵达海岸边缘时，它骤然一跃，飞越那些被遗弃在海上的渔船。掠过广阔的海面，它猛地坠落在水面上的一艘航空母舰上。未曾变换姿态，初号机在其后方生成 AT 力场，将航母的控制塔斩断，使其坠入水中。

Jumping again, it soared above the aircraft carrier, and this time sliced it cleanly in half with its AT-field, before directing its attention to another ship. But just as Shinji was about to destroy the next battle ship, he paused in mid air as he heard the large plane that he had heard earlier above him. Landing on the battleship that he had been about to destroy, he looked up into the sky and could just make out the stealth bomber high up in the sky. It was too high for him to reach by jumping, and out of reach with his AT-field, but oh what he would have given to be able to destroy it.  
再次跃起，它凌空飞越航空母舰，这次用 AT 力场将其干净利落地一分为二，随后转向另一艘舰船。但就在真嗣准备摧毁下一艘战舰时，他在半空中顿住了，因为他听到了之前在上空听到的那架大型飞机的声音。他落在即将摧毁的战舰上，抬头望向天空，勉强能辨认出高空中的隐形轰炸机。那高度远非他跳跃所能及，AT 力场也鞭长莫及，但他多么希望能将其摧毁。

'Bastard,' thought Shinji, as he turned away from the bomber, but something caught his eye, because he turned back to face it. Twelve white specs seemed to be floating down on the air, and each was getting bigger and bigger by the second. Shinji grimaced slightly as he figured what they were. Turning back to the battleship, he pushed off against it, propelling himself back to the land, while in turn, easily capsizing it. He could see little dots in the water which he assumed to be the sailors from the battleship. Hopefully they could stay afloat long enough to get help, but that wasn't Shinji's jurisdiction.  
“混蛋，”真嗣心想，转身离开轰炸机，但有什么东西吸引了他的注意，因为他又转回身面对它。十二个白色小点似乎正随风飘落，且每秒都在变得越来越大。真嗣微微皱眉，猜到了它们是什么。他转身面向战舰，用力一推，借力返回陆地，同时轻易地将其掀翻。他能看到水中的小点，猜想是战舰上的水兵。希望他们能漂浮足够长时间等待救援，但这不在真嗣的职责范围内。

Landing back on dry land, Shinji looked above him and saw that the twelve white objects were now circling above him, as though they were birds of prey, and they sorta were; Shinji saw that they had wings like that of a bird on their backs. Each of them landed around him, forming a circle.  
回到干燥的陆地上，真嗣抬头望去，看到那十二个白色物体正盘旋在他上方，仿佛是捕食的猛禽，某种程度上确实如此；真嗣注意到它们背上有着类似鸟类的翅膀。它们一个个降落在他周围，形成了一个圆圈。

"So this is the Eva series" mumbled Shinji as he looked out at the enemy in front of him. He thought they looked strangely reptilian.  
“这就是《EVA》系列吗”，真嗣喃喃自语，望着面前的敌人。他觉得它们看起来异常像爬行动物。

Wiping some blood off his cheek, he thought grimly, 'This wont be easy.'  
他一边擦去脸颊上的血迹，一边阴沉地想，‘这不会容易。’

The N2 bomb is what woke Asuka from her fitful sleep.  
是 N2 炸弹将惴惴不安的明日香从睡梦中惊醒。

The force of the explosion reached all the way into Terminal Dogma, sending vibrations through the metal wall, which was what Asuka was leaning against; the vibrations startled her awake. She jumped upward as she felt an unpleasant feeling travel up her spine. Looking wildly around, the only thing that she could see was Rei still sitting in her chair and reading her book, but Asuka's desperation won over her hatred for Rei, because she asked, "What the hell was that just now?"  
爆炸的冲击波一直传到了终端教条区，金属墙壁随之震动，明日香正是靠在这墙上；震动让她惊醒。她感到一阵不祥之感沿着脊椎升起，猛地跳了起来。慌乱地环顾四周，她唯一能看到的是绫波仍坐在椅子上读着书，但明日香的绝望战胜了对绫波的厌恶，她问道，“刚才那是什么鬼东西？”

"An N2 bomb most likely," said Rei without taking her eyes off the book.  
"一个 N2 炸弹，极有可能。" 丽说着，目光依旧没有离开书本。

Asuka's eyes widened at that. "Are you serious?"  
听到这话，明日香的眼睛瞪大了。"你是认真的吗？"

"Why would I lie?" "我为什么要撒谎？"

Asuka hated this for some reason, because she narrowed her eyes in annoyance and turned away from Rei. Its not that she wished she was back asleep, when her dreams were so painful, but the waking world wasn't much better either.  
不知为何，明日香对此感到厌恶，她眯起眼睛表示不满，并转过身去不再看绫波。并非她希望回到那些痛苦的梦境中，但清醒的世界也并没有好到哪里去。

'And at least this socially challenged moron isn't in them,' thought Asuka with a sidelong glanced at Rei. Asuka didn't know how long she had been asleep, but she didn't think it had been long, an hour at most likely.  
'至少这个社交障碍的笨蛋不在梦里，'明日香斜眼瞥了绫波一眼，心想。她不清楚自己睡了多久，但觉得应该不久，最多也就一个小时。

'What the hell is going on up there?' she wondered.  
"'上面到底发生了什么鬼事？'她暗自思忖。

Next second, the roar of Unit 01 could be heard from above in Tokyo-3. Asuka jumped immensely as she heard the cry of fury from Unit 01, but she thought she heard another voice in the mix...his voice...  
下一秒，东京-3 上空传来了初号机的咆哮声。听到初号机愤怒的嘶吼，明日香吓了一大跳，但她觉得其中似乎还夹杂着另一个声音……他的声音……

'He's angry for what they did,' she thought. At the table across from her, even Rei seemed to have paused and was looking up at the ceiling, listening to the roar of Shinji and Unit 01.  
'他因为他们的所作所为而愤怒，'她心想。坐在她对面的桌上，甚至连绫波零也似乎停顿了一下，抬头望向天花板，聆听着真嗣和初号机的咆哮。

Just then, the metal door opened and a man walked in. Asuka tensed up almost instantly, and with good reason; Gendo Ikari had just walked into the room.  
就在这时，金属门打开了，一个男人走了进来。明日香几乎立刻就紧张起来，这并非没有道理；碇源堂刚刚走进了房间。

"It is time Rei," he said simply.  
"是时候了，丽，" 他简单地说道。

Rei looked at him for a second before she stood up without a word and walked over to him. Neither of them gave the slightest sign that they noticed Asuka standing in a corner of the room, but she was, and she saw the entire thing pass by in a few seconds. Now that she actually looked closer, as Gendo started walking away, she saw that blood was dripping off his right arm, and what seemed to be large pieces of dead skin cells were flaking off his arm and falling to the floor.  
丽看了他一眼，随即一言不发地站起身，走向他。两人都没有表现出注意到明日香站在房间角落的样子，但她确实在那里，目睹了这一切在几秒钟内发生。当碇源堂开始走开时，她仔细一看，发现他的右臂正在滴血，而且似乎有大块的死皮细胞从手臂上剥落，掉在地上。

'What the hell?' she thought.  
'这到底是怎么回事？' 她心想。

As they disappeared into the darkness outside, Asuka took a few hesitant steps towards the door, before she broke into a fast walk and stopped in the opening of the door. She looked out into the darkened hallway, but didn't see any sign of the soldiers which had been positioned there earlier. The lights that had hung along the tops of the walls were also out.  
当他们消失在外面的黑暗中时，明日香犹豫地向门口走了几步，随即加快步伐，停在门口。她向外望向昏暗的走廊，但并未看到之前守在那里的士兵的任何踪迹。挂在墙顶的灯也熄灭了。

Everything was dark, but Asuka thought that she could find her way to the elevator shaft without too much difficulty. Taking several steps into the dark, she briefly looked around for Rei and Gendo, before disregarding them and breaking into a full out run. Turning around a corner, she stopped dead and had to hold back the loud gasp that threatened to spill forth from her mouth. A soldiers was lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood, apparently dead. He had a large gash right down his chest, slicing into his sternum. Asuka sucked in her breath so as not to smell the stench of blood, and edged around him, careful to not slip in the blood.  
一切都是黑暗的，但明日香认为自己可以不太困难地找到电梯井。她走进黑暗中几步，短暂地环顾四周寻找绫波和碇，随后不顾他们，全力奔跑起来。转过一个拐角，她猛地停下，不得不抑制住即将从口中爆发的惊呼。一名士兵躺在地上，身下是一滩自己的血，显然已经死亡。他的胸口有一道深深的伤口，直切到胸骨。明日香深吸一口气，以免闻到血腥味，小心翼翼地绕过他，生怕在血泊中滑倒。

Breaking into another run, she quickly reached the elevator, and placed both hands on her knees and bent over, catching her breath. She didn't even know why she was doing this, only that if she didn't get an answer, she wouldn't be able to live with herself, or anyone else for that matter.  
再次奔跑起来，她迅速到达电梯前，双手撑着膝盖弯下腰，喘着粗气。她甚至不知道自己为何这么做，只知道如果得不到答案，她将无法面对自己，也无法面对任何人。

'Stop that!' she shouted into her mind.  
'别这样！'她在心中大喊。

But she didn't care anymore. That idiot was fighting by himself, and that cry had held more than just anger, she had heard pain mixed into the middle of it.  
但她已经不在乎了。那个傻瓜独自一人在战斗，那声呼喊中不仅有愤怒，她还听出了夹杂其中的痛苦。

'He never asks for help,' she thought, 'and he never relies on anybody else. Is he that alone? Like me? How is it that we are so similar, yet we can't understand each other.'  
“他从不求助，”她心想，“也不依赖任何人。他如此孤独吗？像我一样？为何我们如此相似，却无法理解彼此？”

I want to understand you! I want to help you when you stumble. I want to laugh with you when you're happy! I want to stay by your side!  
我想理解你！当你跌倒时，我想帮助你。当你快乐时，我想与你一同欢笑！我想留在你身边！

I don't care anymore! Even if I am hurt! Even if I have to drag myself to be with you, I don't care! So please...don't ignore me; don't shun me, don't hurt me, accept me for who I am!  
我不在乎了！即使我会受伤！即使我必须拖着身子与你在一起，我也不在乎！所以请……不要忽视我；不要回避我，不要伤害我，接受真实的我！

Asuka straightened up, her mind set on what she was going to do.  
明日香挺直了身子，心中已定下她即将要做的事。

"You stupid idiot," she mumbled, "don't do this alone...not without me."  
“你这个蠢货，”她喃喃自语，“别一个人去……没有我，不行。”

Running into the elevator, she hammered on the up button, and waited for it to take her up to Central Dogma.  
冲进电梯，她猛按上楼按钮，等待着电梯将她带到中央教条区。

Far above her, Shinji started his battle with the Eva series...  
在高高的上方，真嗣开始了与 EVA 系列的战斗...

### Chapter 30: Cornered 
第三十章：困兽之斗  

**Happy Halloween Everyone! Okay so, originally this was supposed to be a double post (like last years) but I ran out of time. But expect the next chapter out in a week or so, and consider this my treat to every one of my fans on Halloween. Don't eat till you puke!  
祝大家万圣节快乐！好吧，原本这应该是双更的（就像去年那样），但我时间不够了。不过预计下一章大约一周后会发布，就当是我给每位粉丝的万圣节礼物吧。别吃到吐哦！**

---

Unit 01 stood motionless in Tokyo-3, watching the Eva Series, waiting for them to make a move. If Shinji was honest with himself, he was rather anxious about the fight that he would be having with. If he attacked headlong at the closest one to him, then all of them would probably attack him at once. Even so though, it wasn't as though he could stay motionless forever.  
初号机在第三新东京市静止不动，注视着 EVA 系列机体，等待它们采取行动。如果真嗣对自己诚实的话，他会承认自己对即将到来的战斗感到相当焦虑。如果他直接攻击离他最近的那台，那么所有机体很可能会同时向他发起攻击。即便如此，他也不能永远保持静止不动。

'The Eva Series all have the S2 engine built into them, like Unit 01,' thought Shinji. 'So they can theoretically go indefinitely. And of course they were created with Kaoru's DNA...so it'll be like fighting twelve of him at once I suppose...'  
'EVA 系列机体都内置了 S2 引擎，比如初号机，' 真嗣心想。'所以理论上它们可以无限期运行。当然，它们是用薰的 DNA 创造的……所以大概就像同时对抗十二个他一样……'

Biting down on his lips, a small trickle of blood dribbled down, pausing at his chin and then fell into his lap.  
他咬紧嘴唇，一丝血迹缓缓流下，停在下巴处，然后滴落在他的腿上。

'Here we go,' thought Shinji.  
'开始了，' 真嗣心想。

Unit 01 charged at the closest Eva Unit to it, sending out a shockwave that blew the cars on the block in several directions. Glass in the nearby offices buildings shattered, raining down on the pavement below.  
初号机向最近的 EVA 单位发起冲锋，释放出的冲击波将街区上的汽车吹得四处飞散。附近办公楼的玻璃纷纷破碎，如雨般洒落在下方的路面上。

Unit 01 drew back its fist quickly, and plowed it directly into the jaw of the first Eva Unit. Immediately the jaw shattered, spraying blood in several direction. The Eva Unit was sent flying backwards before crashing into an office building, The steel beams crumpled as the body of the Eva made contact with it. Red gore was poking out of the Eva Units mouth.  
初号机迅速收回拳头，猛地一拳直击第一个 EVA 单位的下颚。瞬间，下颚粉碎，血液四溅。EVA 单位被击飞后退，撞入一栋办公楼，钢梁在 EVA 机体接触的瞬间扭曲变形。EVA 单位的口中渗出鲜红的血肉。

Seeing there ally incapacitated the other Eva Units started moving. Shinji spun around with Unit 01 and brought Unit 01's arms up just in time as what looked like a giant metal spear came crashing down on Unit 01's arms. Shinji immediately felt his own arms break as the bones in Unit 01 broke. Fighting back the scream that threatened to erupt from his mouth, Shinji had Unit 01 draw its leg back before kicking the Eva Unit square in the chest. The Eva Unit skidded backwards several feet before it came to a rest. Shinji now saw that each of the Eva Units had one of those strange looking spears and that it seemed to have been concealed behind the wings of the Eva Units.  
看到同伴被制服，其他 EVA 机体开始行动。真嗣操控初号机迅速转身，及时举起双臂，挡住了如同巨型金属长矛般砸下的攻击。真嗣立刻感受到自己手臂的断裂，初号机的骨骼也随之破碎。他强忍着即将爆发的尖叫，操控初号机后退一步，随即猛踢向那台 EVA 机体的胸口。那台 EVA 机体向后滑行数尺才停下。真嗣此时发现，每台 EVA 机体都持有一把形状奇特的长矛，似乎之前隐藏在机翼之后。

'Lets try this then,' thought Shinji.  
'那就试试这个吧，'真嗣心想。

Quickly moving forward and breaking the sound barrier, Unit 01 crashed against the Eva Unit which had attacked it moments before. Not letting it have any chance of retaliating, Unit 01 quickly generated its AT-field and sliced horizontally into the soft flesh of the Eva Unit just below the rib cage. It wasn't a clean cut, since the AT-field hadn't sliced all the way through, but it had its desired affect. Blood spilled out out of the Eva Unit along with what looked like large organs.  
初号机迅速前进，突破音障，猛烈撞击刚刚攻击它的那台 EVA 机体。不给对方任何反击的机会，初号机迅速生成 AT 力场，横向切入 EVA 机体肋骨下方的柔软部位。虽然切割并不干净，AT 力场并未完全穿透，但达到了预期效果。血液与看似巨大的内脏从 EVA 机体中涌出。

Jumping backwards, Shinji quickly deduced what he had seen.  
向后跳跃的同时，真嗣迅速推断出了他所看到的情况。

'They seem to be abnormally slower than Unit 01, and while they can function without a pilot, they don't seem to have much of a thought process.'  
“它们似乎比初号机异常地慢，而且虽然它们可以在没有驾驶员的情况下运作，但似乎并没有多少思考过程。”

Turning to his left, he saw that the remaining Eva Units seemed to waiting for him to move, though if Shinji didn't know any better, it almost seemed as though they were slightly wary of him now.  
转向左边，他发现剩下的 EVA 机体似乎在等待他行动，尽管如果真嗣不了解情况的话，它们现在看起来几乎对他有些微妙的警惕。

'I suppose that after what I did to their allies though, it's to be expected.'  
'我想，在我对他们盟友所做的一切之后，这也在意料之中。'

Smirking slightly, Shinji moved forward to the next one, thinking that it wouldn't be much trouble when he saw a brief blur from one of the Eva Units close to him. Next second he had to generate Unit 01's AT-fields as a flash of orange erupted from the Eva Unit.  
微微冷笑了一下，真嗣向前移动到下一个目标，心想这不会太麻烦，却突然看到附近一台 EVA 单位闪过一瞬模糊。下一秒，他不得不生成 01 号机的 AT 力场，因为那台 EVA 单位爆发出一道橙色的闪光。

'They can even create AT-fields?' thought Shinji. He hadn't counted on that.  
'他们甚至能创造 AT 力场？' 真嗣心想。他没料到这一点。

Sensing movement behind him, he quickly pushed back the Eva's AT-field, breaking it in the process and spun around. Another Eva Unit was towering over him and was just swinging down the metal spear. Shinji was forced to make Unit 01 roll out of the way as it dodged the spear.  
感觉到身后的动静，他迅速推开 Eva 的 AT 力场，将其破坏的同时转身。另一台 Eva 正俯视着他，金属长矛正挥舞而下。真嗣不得不让 01 号机翻滚躲避，避开了长矛的攻击。

'Shit!' “该死！”

The Eva Unit spun with him as he rolled, swinging the metal spear all the while. As it swung it again though, Unit 01 managed to grab that spear with its hands. Quickly generating Unit 01's AT-field, Shinji managed to slice off the arms of the Eva Unit, making a fountain of blood and bone marrow shoot out of the stub of an arm. The severed arms fell to the ground with a loud 'thud' creating a small indent in the ground. The Eva didn't seem to be done though, as its strange looking head suddenly lashed outward at Unit 01's outstretched arm, and bit down on it. Shinji did scream then, as it felt like teeth the size of a semi-truck were biting down on his broken arm which had just started to heal. A large chunk was taken out of Shinji's right arm, leaving nothing holding the flesh together except for a few small tendons. Though heavily dazed from the pain, Shinji still managed to have Unit 01 bring its left arm up and drive it directly into the side of the Eva Units head.  
Eva 机体随着他的翻滚一同旋转，同时挥舞着金属长矛。然而，当它再次挥动时，初号机设法用双手抓住了那根长矛。迅速生成初号机的 AT 力场，真嗣成功切断了 Eva 机体的双臂，使得血液和骨髓如喷泉般从断臂处喷涌而出。断臂重重地落在地上，发出一声巨响，并在地面砸出一个小坑。但那 Eva 似乎并未就此罢休，它那奇异的头颅突然向初号机伸出的手臂猛扑过去，狠狠咬住。真嗣随即发出惨叫，感觉仿佛是被半挂车大小的牙齿咬在了刚刚开始愈合的断臂上。一大块肉从真嗣的右臂上被撕下，仅剩下几根细小的肌腱维系着残存的皮肉。尽管因剧痛而意识模糊，真嗣仍指挥初号机抬起左臂，猛地刺入 Eva 机体的头部侧面。

Blood and gore exploded out the other side of the Eva Unit's head, spraying the building next to it with brain matter. Both the eyeballs popped out, leaving eye sockets dark except for the red blood that was steadily flowing out. The teeth that had been clamped onto the arm of Unit 01 snapped off, still embedded into the arm of Unit 01.  
鲜血与脑浆从 EVA 头部另一侧炸裂开来，溅射到旁边的建筑物上。两只眼球弹出，留下空洞的眼窝，只有不断流出的鲜血染红了周围。原本紧咬着零一号机手臂的牙齿断裂，仍嵌在零一号机的手臂中。

Knowing that he didn't have long before another one attacked him, Unit 01 grabbed the teeth that were sunken into it arms with its left arm, and pulled them out. A small trickle of blood flowed out of the open wound. It didn't seem like it had effected Unit 01 much...only Shinji.  
意识到另一只使徒很快会再次攻击他，零一号机用左臂抓住嵌入其手臂的牙齿，将其拔出。一道细小的血流从伤口中流出。这似乎并未对零一号机造成太大影响...只是对真嗣而言。

Looking down at the state of his own arm, Shinji thought, 'I've only managed to destroy three of these things, and already I'm being backed into a corner.'  
看着自己手臂的惨状，真嗣心想，'我只摧毁了三只使徒，就已经被逼到绝境了。'

Forcing Unit 01 to straighten up, Shinji dove forward as he sensed movement behind him. The building that Unit 01 had been leaning against had been split in two by one of the metal spears, which had sliced the building horizontally.  
迫使 01 号机挺直身躯，真嗣在感觉到身后动静时向前猛扑。01 号机原本倚靠的建筑被一根金属长矛横向劈成两半。

Crashing into another building, Unit 01 spun around and just barely managed to duck as the spear came close to impaling its right shoulder. With the Eva Unit in view now though, Unit quickly brought back its left fist and sunk into the Eva Units stomach, making it reel backwards slightly. Gaining enough leverage now, Unit 01 right leg shot out suddenly, catching the Eva Unit in the stomach again, this time sending it into the remaining ruins of the building that it had recently destroyed.  
01 号机撞入另一栋建筑，迅速转身，险险躲过长矛刺向右肩的攻击。随即，01 号机左拳回击，深深打入使徒的腹部，使其略微后仰。趁势而起，01 号机右腿猛然踢出，再次击中使徒腹部，将其击飞至刚刚摧毁的建筑废墟中。

His arm still bleeding profusely, and his vision starting to grow foggy, Shinji quickly generated Unit 01's AT-field and brought it down mercilessly on top of the Eva Units head. It instantly crushed, splattering blood along the remaining concrete walls of the building behind it.  
手臂依旧血流如注，视线开始模糊，真嗣迅速生成 01 号机的 AT 力场，无情地压向使徒头部。瞬间将其压碎，血花四溅，洒落在背后的建筑残垣上。

Moving away from the destroyed skull of the Eva Unit, Unit 01 went in the opposite direction, away from the other Eva Units. Shinji knew that he had to give his almost destroyed arm time to recover, and continuing the fight wasn't going to help.  
从被摧毁的 Eva 初号机头颅旁移开，初号机朝着相反的方向疾驰而去，远离其他 Eva 机体。真嗣明白他必须给几乎被毁的手臂一些恢复的时间，继续战斗只会适得其反。

Putting on a huge burst of speed, Unit 01 broke the sound barrier once again as it tore through the streets of Tokyo-3, destroying the exterior of the few remaining buildings. His arm had slowly started healing, but it was still going to be a while before he would be able to move properly again.  
初号机猛然加速，再次突破音障，撕裂了东京-3 街道上仅存的几座建筑的外墙。他的手臂已开始缓慢愈合，但要想完全恢复行动能力还需一段时间。

Backing up against a nearby building, Shinji paused but didn't sense any of the enemies AT-fields around him. Breathing a sigh of relief, he looked down at the state of his ragged arm. The sinews had started to reform and rejoin the damaged tissue, but his arm still looked as though a large dog had almost bitten it off.  
真嗣退至附近的一栋建筑旁，停下脚步，却未感知到周围有敌人的 AT 力场。他松了一口气，低头看着自己残破的手臂。肌腱开始重新连接受损组织，但手臂看上去仍像是被一只大狗几乎咬断一般。

The density of the LCL fluid seemed to change particularly around his arm, as though it was speeding up the process of the regeneration, which Shinji reminded himself, it probably was; he vaguely remembered what Asuka had told him before.  
LCL 液体的密度似乎在他手臂周围发生了特别的变化，仿佛加速了再生过程，这让真嗣提醒自己，这很可能就是事实；他隐约记得明日香之前告诉过他什么。

Frowning slightly at the thought of her, he shook his head briefly and gripped the controls of Unit 01 tighter, straining his arm more than he should, but the pain helped him forget.  
一想到她，他微微皱眉，短暂地摇了摇头，更紧地握住了初号机的操纵杆，手臂的用力超出了应有的程度，但疼痛让他暂时忘却了烦恼。

"Another few minutes and everything should be back to normal," whispered Shinji in the orange darkness of Unit 01's entry plug.  
“再过几分钟，一切应该就会恢复正常。”真嗣在初号机插入栓的橙色昏暗中低声说道。

Asuka wasn't sure how long she had spent pacing back and forth inside the elevator as she waited for it to take her into Central Dogma, but she was almost certain she had worn a permanent track in the floor.  
明日香不确定自己在电梯里来回踱步等了多久，才等到它把她带到中央教条区，但她几乎可以肯定地板上已经磨出了永久的痕迹。

As she reached the top of the elevator though, she heard what sounded like shouts and sporadic gunfire. Tensing up slightly, she briefly had second thoughts about her actions, but pushed them quickly away. It was too late to turn back now, too late along time ago for that matter.  
然而，当她到达电梯顶部时，她听到了像是喊叫声和零星的枪声。她稍微紧张起来，短暂地对自己的行动产生了疑虑，但很快就把这些念头抛开了。现在回头已经太晚了，很久以前就已经太晚了。

As the elevator doors opened though, Asuka got her first glimpse of the horrors in which human beings could inflict on each other.  
然而，当电梯门打开时，明日香第一次目睹了人类能彼此施加的恐怖景象。

A female soldier directly in front of her, who seemed to have been running backwards with a gun in her hand, was shot cleanly in the back. The bullet surged through her spinal cord, splintering the bone and shearing out the other side of her breastplate. She immediately toppled to the ground, blood pooling around her until she looked like a rag doll that had been dipped in ketchup.  
一名女兵正对着她，似乎是倒退着持枪奔跑时，被一枪干净利落地击中背部。子弹穿透了她的脊髓，粉碎了骨头，从胸甲的另一侧破出。她立刻倒地，鲜血在她周围汇聚，直到她看起来像一个被浸在番茄酱里的布娃娃。

Asuka stood there for several seconds, unable to think as her mind replayed the image of the woman in front of her dying a sudden death. It had happened so suddenly. Who was she? Did she have a husband? Kids? What was her life like? Asuka would never know, but it was her first time seeing the killing of a human by another human, and it was somehow more grotesque than the Angels which they had been fighting before now.  
明日香站在那里几秒钟，无法思考，脑海中反复回放着眼前这位女子突然死亡的画面。这一切发生得太突然了。她是谁？她有丈夫吗？有孩子吗？她的生活是怎样的？明日香永远不会知道，但这是她第一次亲眼目睹人类被另一个人类杀害，这比他们之前对抗的使徒还要更加令人作呕。

Stepping back into the elevator, she pushed herself against the far wall and sank down to her knees. What would happen if she herself went out there? Would she meet the same fate as the body in front of her? She really didn't want to find out.  
她退回到电梯里，将自己靠在远端的墙上，跪坐下来。如果她自己出去会怎样？她会遭遇和眼前那具尸体一样的命运吗？她真的不想知道。

But then she heard several voices from the direction the woman had been running away from, and she recognized one of them.  
但随后她听到从女人逃跑的方向传来了几个声音，其中有一个她认出来了。

"Misato?" she mumbled under her breath.  
“美里？”她低声自语。

Getting up from her kneeling position, she slowly walked over to the elevator door and peered around the door to the far side of the corridor. Misato was hurrying towards the elevator with Kaji and several other people which Asuka guessed to be Nerv security guards. Feeling rather hesitant after seeing humans kill each other, Asuka cringed slightly as she saw the drawn gun that Misato had in her hand. But she had known Misato since she had decided to join Nerv, and knew that she would never hurt her.  
她从跪着的姿势站起身，缓缓走向电梯门，探头望向走廊的另一侧。美里正与加持以及几位阿斯卡猜测是 NERV 保安的人匆忙赶向电梯。看到人类互相残杀的场景后，阿斯卡感到犹豫不决，当她注意到美里手中的枪时，不禁微微退缩。但她自加入 NERV 以来就认识美里，深知她绝不会伤害自己。

Stepping out in the white corridor, she was careful to not look at the body behind her and hurriedly walked forward. Misato seemed to have seen Asuka, because she shouted instructions at the security guards with her who seemed to assume position along the corridor as though they were guarding something. Misato then holstered her pistol and ran forward towards Asuka who was standing still just outside the elevator doors; Kaji was a few steps behind her.  
踏出白色走廊，她小心翼翼地没有回头看身后的尸体，急匆匆地向前走去。美里似乎看到了明日香，因为她对着身边似乎在走廊上就位警戒的安全人员大声下达指令。随后，美里收起手枪，快步跑向站在电梯门外的明日香；加持紧随其后几步之遥。

Asuka, who had expected scorn from Misato, was therefore rather surprised when Misato drew her into a comforting hug when she reached her.  
明日香本以为会遭到美里的嘲讽，因此当美里跑到她身边时，给了她一个安慰的拥抱，这让她颇为惊讶。

"Asuka," mumbled Misato, "what are doing up here? You should still be in Terminal Dogma with Rei."  
“明日香，”美里咕哝道，“你在这里做什么？你应该还在中央教条区跟绫波在一起。”

"Rei left with the commander," muttered Asuka as she looked over Misato's shoulder to Kaji who was watch them silently, but keeping the corridor in his peripheral vision all the while.  
"丽跟着司令走了，" 明日香嘟囔着，从美里肩头望向一直默默注视着他们的加持，同时始终用余光留意着走廊。

"What?" asked Misato startled. "What do you mean Rei left with the commander?"  
"什么？" 美里吃惊地问，"你说丽跟着司令走了是什么意思？

"Just that," replied Asuka, "the commander came to get Rei for something, and the both of them disappeared afterwards. I left the room, but didn't see any of the guards that had been posted."  
"就是那样，" 明日香回答，"司令来找丽，不知为了什么事，然后他们俩就消失了。我离开了房间，但没看到任何原本应该在那儿的警卫。

Misato narrowed her eyes, briefly wondering where the commander and Rei had gone, but it had really got out of her area of expertise. She'd just have to hope for the best.  
美里眯起眼睛，短暂地疑惑司令和丽去了哪里，但这确实超出了她的专业范畴。她只能寄希望于最好的结果。

"But then...why are you up here? I mean...I can understand you wondering whats going on above, but-"  
“但那么...你为什么在这里？我是说...我能理解你好奇上面发生了什么，但是——”

"Misato, I want you to help me get to the Evangelions chamber," said Asuka cutting Misato off curtly.  
“美里，我要你帮我到达 EVA 的机舱，”明日香干脆地打断了美里的话。

"What? Asuka, why would you want to go there?"  
"什么？明日香，你为什么要去那里？"

"I'm going to help out Shinji," replied Asuka, "he can't do this on his own."  
"我要去帮真嗣，"明日香回答道，"他一个人做不了这件事。"

"Asuka...you're Evangelion can't even fight, nor have you even piloted it since your...accident with the angel."  
"明日香...你的 EVA 甚至不能战斗，自从你和使徒的那次...事故后，你也没再驾驶过它。"

"But Shinji is fighting out there all by himself!"  
"但真嗣他一个人在外面战斗啊！"

"Asuka you-" "明日香，你——"

"I what Misato?" asked Asuka rather snappishly. "Is there something you want to say."  
"我怎么了，美里？"" 明日香有些不耐烦地问道，""你有什么想说的吗？"

"Yes there is actually; there is no way I can't let you enter Unit 02."  
"是的，确实有；我绝不能让你进入 02 号单元。"

"You're not my mother!" "你又不是我妈！"

"No, but I am your guardian."  
"不，但我是你的监护人。"

"Don't you even care what happens to Shinji?"  
"难道你一点也不在乎真嗣会发生什么吗？"

"Of course I do! But having you out there and fighting is the worse thing that could possibly happen. If Shinji knew that you were-"  
"我当然在乎！但让你出去战斗是可能发生的最糟糕的事情。如果真嗣知道你——"

But Misato cut herself off before she finished that particular sentence. But it seemed that Asuka was still determined to get past her.  
但美里在说完这句话之前就自己打断了。不过，看来明日香仍然决心要突破她的阻拦。

"I don't care whether you're my guardian or not. I'm fifteen years old; I can look after myself."  
"我不在乎你是不是我的监护人。我已经十五岁了；我能照顾好自己。"

"Asuka-" "明日香——"

"I don't know what happened between me and Shinji, but I can't stand by and do nothing while everyone else is putting their lives in danger."  
"我不知道我和真嗣之间发生了什么，但我不能眼睁睁看着大家都在冒生命危险而什么都不做。"

Misato stared at her for a moment before she turned to Kaji and asked him, "Aren't you going to say anything?"  
美里盯着她看了一会儿，然后转向加持，问道：“你就不打算说点什么吗？”

Without bothering to look over his shoulder, Kaji replied, "She has her mind set on what she wants to do. Whether it's the right thing to do though remains to be seen. But whatever you decide Misato, you should decided it quick. We can't stay in one place for too long."  
加持没有回头，随口答道：“她已经打定主意要做什么了。至于这是否正确，还有待观察。但无论你决定什么，美里，你得快点决定。我们不能在一个地方停留太久。”

"I know, but-" “我知道，但是——”

"Misato, take me there!" yelled Asuka.  
"美里，带我去那里！" 明日香大喊道。

Misato bit down on her lip painfully. Asuka wanted to help at any cost, even if it harmed her in some way. If Shinji was here, he would have definitely forbade her, though how she wasn't sure.  
美里痛苦地咬紧了嘴唇。明日香不惜一切代价想要帮忙，即使这会以某种方式伤害到她自己。如果真嗣在这里，他肯定会坚决禁止她这么做，尽管她不确定他会怎么做。

"I can't, none of the elevators are working. Before Shinji left, he destroyed all the elevators."  
"我不能，所有的电梯都不能用了。在真嗣离开之前，他破坏了所有的电梯。"

"Why did he do that?"  
“他为什么那么做？”

Misato thought it wrong to tell her that he did it to prevent her from doing exactly what she was trying to do.  
美里觉得告诉她，他那么做是为了防止她去做她正试图做的事情，这并不妥当。

"Because I told him too," she said after a moments pause.  
“因为我也这么告诉他了，”她顿了一下后说道。

"What about the ventilation ducts?" asked Asuka quickly.  
"通风管道怎么样？" 明日香迅速问道。

'Damn it,' thought Misato.  
'该死，' 美里心想。

"Well, it is possible, but going to such lengths just to-"  
"嗯，这是可能的，但为了这么点事就大费周章——"

"Don't say that," mumbled Asuka, "don't act as if it doesn't matter, because it does. You understand that too Misato, but you don't want to acknowledge it. I said before...that I don't know what happened between me and Shinji, and I don't rightfully know if I care anymore to know about my broken memory. But I do care to know about him."  
"别这么说，"明日香咕哝着，"别表现得好像无所谓，因为事实并非如此。你也明白这一点，美里，但你不想承认。我之前说过……我不清楚我和真嗣之间发生了什么，我也不确定我是否还想知道那些破碎的记忆。但我确实想知道关于他的事。"

"Misato," mumbled Kaji, interjecting his own voice into the conversation as though telling them to hurry.  
"美里，"加持低声插话，仿佛在催促他们快点。"

"I know," snapped Misato.  
"我知道，"美里厉声回应。"

Glancing at Asuka again, Misato briefly thought about the many changes that Asuka had gone through, all thanks to Shinji when she really thought about it. But likely, everything buried deep within Asuka always wanted to spring forth, and Shinji was match that did that. Misato supposed that Asuka had really grown up, no, they had grown up. They didn't need her anymore.  
再次瞥了一眼明日香，美里短暂地思考了明日香经历的诸多变化，这一切都归功于真嗣，当她深入思考时。但很可能，深藏在明日香内心的一切总是渴望迸发出来，而真嗣就是点燃这一切的火花。美里认为明日香真的长大了，不，是他们长大了。他们不再需要她了。

"...Are you sure about this?" asked Misato one final time.  
“……你确定要这么做吗？”美里最后一次问道。

"As sure as I know that I'm an Evangelion Pilot," replied Asuka, breaking into somewhat of a smile.  
“就像我确信自己是一名 EVA 驾驶员一样确定，”明日香回答道，脸上露出了些许微笑。

Sighing heavily, Misato relented.  
米萨托重重地叹了口气，终于让步了。

"Okay, if this is what you really want."  
“好吧，如果这真的是你想要的。”

"It is," said Asuka. “是的，”明日香说。

Misato gazed at Asuka for a minute before she said, "You've grown up you know...both you and Shinji...together, and I got to watch everything as it unfolded...so I suppose I should be grateful that I got to witness your changes."  
美里凝视着明日香，片刻后说道：“你长大了，你知道吗……你和真嗣……一起，而我见证了这一切的展开……所以我想我应该感激能目睹你们的成长。”

Asuka's eyes widened slightly at Misato's words as she asked, "Misato...what do you mean by together?"  
明日香听到美里的话，眼睛微微睁大，问道：“美里……你说的‘一起’是什么意思？”

Misato smiled slightly as she said, "Nothing, forget I said anything."  
美里微微一笑，说道：“没什么，忘了我说的吧。”

Asuka frowned slightly, but knew she was going to get any further with this conversation, that and Kaji was pointedly getting anxious about being there. They had been stationary for at least ten minutes.  
明日香微微皱眉，但她知道再继续这场对话也无济于事，何况加持明显越来越焦躁，不想待在这里。他们已经静止不动至少十分钟了。

"We need to move," said Kaji to Misato, while simultaneously motioning to the other security guards.  
“我们需要行动，”加持对美里说，同时向其他保安人员示意。

"Right," said Misato. Turning towards the security guards standing there, she told them all, "This here is Asuka Langley Soryu, though you probably know her better as the pilot of Unit 02."  
“好的，”美里说。她转向站在那里的保安人员，告诉他们：“这位是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，不过你们可能更熟悉她作为二号机驾驶员的身份。”

At the mention of her name, and the fact that she's the pilot of an Evangelion, Asuka seemed to shrink, as though she was slightly embarrassed.  
一提到她的名字，以及她是 EVA 驾驶员的事实，明日香似乎有些退缩，仿佛略感尴尬。

"I don't need to tell you how important she is to Nerv, and the world as a whole. Protect her with your life!"  
“我不需要告诉你她对 NERV 以及整个世界有多重要。用你的生命保护她！”

Asuka was rather shocked at how ferocious Misato sounded when she said this, but was rather touched when the security guards gathered around nodded their heads as though they accepted what their life meant right now.  
明日香对美里说这话时的凶猛语气感到相当震惊，但当保安们围拢过来点头时，她又被深深触动了，仿佛他们接受了此刻生命的意义。

"Good," said Misato. "I'm glad we're level with each other. We need to reach the ventilation ducts so that Asuka can make her way into the Evangelions chamber."  
“很好，”美里说，“我很高兴我们能达成一致。我们需要到达通风管道，这样明日香才能进入 EVA 的驾驶舱。”

"The ducts are a few floors above where we are," said Kaji. "We wont be able to use any of the elevators, so we'll have to use an emergency stairway. There should be one a few corridors down."  
“管道在我们所在楼层的几层之上，”加持说，“我们不能使用任何电梯，所以必须使用紧急楼梯。应该在几条走廊之外有一处。”

"Lead the way then," said Misato.  
“那就带路吧，”美里说。

Kaji passed Misato and Asuka then and walked in front of them with the security guards trailing behind everybody, checking over their shoulders occasionally.  
加治越过了美里和明日香，然后走在他们前面，保安人员紧随其后，偶尔回头检查。

As the continued on there way, all the while getting closer to the Evangelions chamber, Asuka thought.  
随着他们继续前行，越来越接近 EVA 的机库，明日香心想。

"Wait for me Shinji!" “等等我，真嗣！”

"That should be good," muttered Shinji inside the entry plug of Unit 01 as he clenched the fist of his right hand. His right arm had repaired itself, leaving the arm exactly as Shinji remembered it, though admittedly, the regeneration process seemed to have sped up once again, though that may have had something to do with the LCL fluid. He didn't think that anybody besides himself could survive more than a few seconds inside the entry plug of Unit 01.  
“应该差不多了。”真嗣在初号机的插入栓内喃喃自语，紧握着右手的拳头。他的右臂已经自我修复，与真嗣记忆中的完全一致，尽管不可否认，再生过程似乎再次加速了，这或许与 LCL 液体有关。他认为除了自己，没有人能在初号机的插入栓内存活超过几秒钟。

The LCL had reached such a density that Shinji could almost feel it constricting and slowing his movement. The orange color had almost completely been replaced by a bright red that was the color of his blood. Shinji was completely linked with Unit 01. He could feel the nerve pulses of Unit 01 through his own body. Unit 01's heart was his, its brain was his, and its anger was his.  
LCL 的密度已经高到让真嗣几乎能感觉到它在限制和减缓他的动作。橙色几乎完全被他血液的鲜红色所取代。真嗣与初号机完全融为一体。他能感受到初号机的神经脉冲通过自己的身体。初号机的心脏是他的，大脑是他的，愤怒也是他的。

He was furious that Seele could do such a thing, those monsters, the Eva Series. He was furious that other nations had so willingly joined in the slaughter of an entire city, purposely seeking out humanoid targets to eradicate. He was furious that the Japanese government had stood aside, even after everything that Nerv had done to protect them, protect the world.  
他对 Seele 能做出这样的事感到愤怒，那些怪物，Eva 系列。他对其他国家如此轻易地参与屠杀整个城市感到愤怒，故意寻找类人目标进行消灭。他对日本政府在 Nerv 为保护他们、保护世界所做的一切之后仍然袖手旁观感到愤怒。

"Its inexcusable," muttered Shinji.  
“这是不可原谅的，”真嗣低声说道。

Making Unit 01 stand up to its full height, Shinji made it move away from the building that it had been crouching behind.  
让零号机站到全高，真嗣让它从一直蹲伏的建筑后面移动开。

'Where are they?' he thought.  
“他们去哪儿了？”他心想。

He had been rather surprised when they hadn't pursued him, surprised that he hadn't even gotten a brief glimpse of an AT-field.  
当他们没有追击他时，他感到相当惊讶，惊讶于他甚至没有瞥见一个 AT 力场。

'Are they waiting for me back there?' he wondered.  
“他们是不是在后面等着我？”他疑惑道。

Taking several tentative steps forward, Shinji paused for a minute, listening and feeling for any sign of movement. Nothing whatsoever came from in front, behind, or to his sides.  
小心翼翼地向前迈了几步，真嗣停顿片刻，倾听并感知四周是否有任何动静。无论是前方、后方还是两侧，都没有任何动静传来。

But something did come from above.  
但上方确实传来了动静。

All at once, Shinji felt the AT-fields of the remaining Eva Units and looked up into the sky. The had taken flight again, and were diving towards him, each of them caring one of those oddly shaped spears. Dodging backwards, just as one of the spears almost impaled Unit 01's right foot, he crashed into a building directly behind him, leveling it to the ground.  
突然间，真嗣感受到了剩余 EVA 机体的 AT 力场，抬头望向天空。它们再次起飞，俯冲向他，每台机体都携带着那种形状奇特的长矛。他急忙向后闪避，就在一支长矛几乎要刺中初号机右脚的瞬间，他撞上了身后的一栋建筑，将其夷为平地。

"Damn it! Move!" “该死！快动！”

Responding to his command, Unit 01 pressed off against the ground with its feet, shooting itself backwards several feet just as another spear threatened to impale its chest. Using its back as a spring, it forced itself upward, just in time as an Eva Unit soared right at it, a spear clutched in its hand. Barely managing to dodge the blow which had been seconds away from piercing the shoulder, Unit 01 grabbed the spear with its left hand, securing the Eva Unit in front of itself, and brought its right fist around, striking it in the side of the head. Like a balloon popping, the head of the Eva Unit exploded, showering Unit 01 in blood and gore.  
听到他的命令，01 号机用脚猛地推地，向后弹射出几英尺，就在另一支长矛即将刺穿其胸膛之际。利用背部作为弹簧，它强行向上跃起，正好躲过迎面飞来的另一台 EVA，对方手中紧握着长矛。勉强躲开了原本几秒内就会刺穿肩膀的一击，01 号机用左手抓住长矛，将那台 EVA 固定在面前，随即挥动右拳，击中其头部侧面。如同气球爆裂一般，那台 EVA 的头颅炸开，血肉四溅，洒满了 01 号机全身。

Shaking off the dead body, Unit 01 turned to the remaining Eva Units. Only seven remained.  
甩开那具尸体，01 号机转向剩下的 EVA 单位。仅剩七台。

"...Damn it Kaoru," he muttered. "If you had actually tried to kill me, would things have ended up like this?"  
"...该死的薰," 他低声咒骂。"如果你真的想杀我，事情会变成这样吗？"

Throwing away his thoughts, he dashed at the closest Eva Unit, generating his AT-field as he went, but moments later was forced to jump upwards as two of the Eva Units flew towards him, skidding across the ground and kicking up dust. As the Eva Units reached the spot where he had jumped, they flew in a vertical line straight upward towards him. It was almost like a World War II dogfight.  
抛开思绪，他向最近的 Eva 机体冲去，同时生成 AT 力场，但片刻后被迫向上跳跃，因为两台 Eva 机体向他飞来，滑过地面扬起尘土。当 Eva 机体到达他跳起的位置时，它们垂直向上飞向他，简直像二战时期的空战。

Twisting around in mid-air so that Unit 01 was now facing towards the oncoming Eva Units, they met in midair. The two Eva Units thrust both of the spears forward, one of them clipping Unit 01 in the side, but not drawing blood. Inside the entry plug Shinji felt as though an airbag had just been discharged directly into his side, likely creating a bruise, but compared to earlier, it was nothing.  
在空中扭转，使 01 号机面对来袭的 Eva 机体，它们在空中相遇。两台 Eva 机体同时向前刺出长矛，其中一支擦过 01 号机的侧面，但没有造成出血。在插入栓内，真嗣感觉像是被一个安全气囊直接撞到侧身，可能会造成瘀伤，但与之前相比，这根本不算什么。

Grabbing both of the spears, Unit 01 twisted them around, breaking them out of the grips of the Eva Units. Attempting to throw them at Eva Units, they both skillfully dodged as they flew to each side, their wings flapping backwards and forwards like a birds. Closing in on Unit 01's side they both generated their AT-fields, attempting to crush Unit 01 with the ensuing weight. Knowing that he didn't have time to decide what to do, Shinji quickly generated both his and Unit 01's AT-field.  
紧握两支长矛，初号机将其扭转，挣脱了其他 EVA 机体的束缚。试图将长矛投向其他 EVA 机体，它们却灵巧地躲闪，向两侧飞去，翅膀如鸟儿般前后扇动。它们迅速逼近初号机，同时展开了各自的 AT 力场，试图用随之而来的重压碾碎初号机。意识到没有时间犹豫，真嗣迅速展开了自己和初号机的 AT 力场。

The four AT-fields crashed against each other, sending out a bright flash of orange light that was seen from as far away as South Korea. Sparks flew as the separate AT-fields clashed against each other, raining down on the other Eva Units below. Before Shinji had even generated his AT-field, he had assumed that it would be nowhere near as powerful as the Eva Series. He right in assuming.  
四重 AT 力场相互碰撞，发出耀眼的橙色光芒，远在韩国都能看见。火花四溅，各自的 AT 力场相互冲击，如雨点般洒落在下方的其他 EVA 机体上。在展开自己的 AT 力场之前，真嗣就预料到其威力远不及 EVA 系列机体。他的猜测完全正确。

They were of course created from the DNA of Tabris, the seventeenth angel, so the strength of their AT-field was already great. Shinji on the other hand, had thought his own AT-field might have been stronger inside the entry plug of Unit 01, but it didn't feel any more powerful that it had been recently. Already feeling the strain in his body, and the slow cracking of his own AT-field, his attention turned to Unit 01.  
它们当然是由第十七使徒塔布里斯（Tabris）的 DNA 创造的，因此它们的 AT 力场原本就很强大。另一方面，真嗣曾以为自己在零一号机（Unit 01）的插入栓内，自己的 AT 力场可能会更强，但实际上并没有感觉到比最近更强大。身体已经感受到压力，自己的 AT 力场也开始缓慢破裂，他的注意力转向了零一号机。

Unit 01 was having no difficulties maintaining its own AT-field, and even seemed to be pushing the Eva Units AT-field back. Cracks started to develop in the enemies AT-field, just as Shinji's own started to deteriorate. He could start to feel the contamination from the Eva Unit starting at his finger tips. Forcing Unit 01 to push forward, the enemies AT-field shattered, forcing it to flying backwards for a second.  
零一号机在维持自己的 AT 力场方面毫无困难，甚至似乎在将 EVA 机体的 AT 力场推回去。敌人的 AT 力场开始出现裂痕，正如真嗣自己的 AT 力场开始恶化一样。他开始感觉到从 EVA 机体传来的污染从指尖开始蔓延。迫使零一号机向前推进，敌人的 AT 力场破碎，使其向后飞退了一瞬间。

Quickly turning to the other, he quickly overlapped his own AT-field with Unit 01's just as his own was about to break. Shattering the others AT-field, it also retreated backwards for a second, but Unit 01 started rocketing backwards towards the earth.  
他迅速转向另一台机体，就在自己的 AT 力场即将破裂之际，迅速与零一号机的 AT 力场重叠。击碎对方的 AT 力场后，它也向后退了一瞬间，但零一号机开始向地球急速后退。

With Unit 01 in free fall now, the other Eva Units which had remained on earth gathered where they projected Unit 01 would land. Seeing this, Shinji quickly generated his own AT-field, projecting it at a spot behind the Eva Units. His AT-field sliced into the many layers of dust, creating something only seen during the Dust Bowl in America. The dust flew in the air in all directions, making it look like a miniature tornado.  
随着 01 号机自由落体，其他留在地球的 EVA 机体聚集在预计 01 号机降落的地方。见此情景，真嗣迅速生成自己的 AT 力场，将其投射到 EVA 机体后方的一处。他的 AT 力场切入层层尘埃，制造出仅在美国沙尘暴时期才可见的景象。尘埃向四面八方飞散，形成了一个微型龙卷风。

Unit 01 landed in the middle of the dust storm, and instantly froze, knowing that the slightest bit of movement could set off the Eva Units. From what Shinji had seen, they didn't have the ability to sense an AT-field like he did, so as long as he didn't move, and avoid the proximity of an nearby AT-fields, he should be-  
01 号机降落在沙尘暴中心，立刻冻结不动，深知任何微小的动作都可能触发 EVA 机体的反应。根据真嗣所见，它们并不具备像他那样感知 AT 力场的能力，所以只要他不移动，并避开附近 AT 力场的范围，他应该能够——

All at once, the dust that had been circling overhead was blown away, as the Eva Units that had been above him used their wings to blow the dust away.  
突然间，头顶盘旋的尘埃被吹散，那些原本在他上方的 EVA 机体利用它们的翅膀将尘埃吹走。

"Damn it!" "该死！"

Twisting around, Shinji saw that one of the Units had thrown one of the spears at him. Shifting Unit 01's legs to his right, he swerved out of the way as the spear went soaring past the side of Unit 01's head. Quickly projecting Unit 01's AT-field, he sent it upwards towards the Eva Units which were still in the air, managing to slice into one of the wings. Losing the aerodynamic wing, the Eva Unit lopsided in mid air as it went crashing back to the ground, its back pointed towards the ground.  
转身一看，真嗣发现其中一台 EVA 向他投掷了一支长矛。他迅速将初号机的腿部向右移动，避开飞驰而过的长矛，矛尖擦过初号机头部的一侧。他迅速展开初号机的 AT 力场，将其向上方的 EVA 机体发射，成功切入其中一台的机翼。失去空气动力翼的 EVA 机体在空中失去平衡，背部朝下坠回地面。

Knowing that he couldn't miss this chance, Shinji made Unit 01 run forward so that he could destroy the falling Eva Unit. Dodging another spear that was thrown at him, Shinji generated his own AT-field as another one flew at him, skimming the ground ever so slightly. Though his AT-field didn't have the power that Unit 01's did, he managed to stop the Eva Unit for a few seconds, before Unit 01 ground its left fist into the Eva Unit's chest.  
真嗣深知不能错过这个机会，指挥初号机向前冲刺，准备摧毁那台坠落的 EVA 机体。他躲过另一支投来的长矛，同时生成自己的 AT 力场，迎击另一支贴地飞来的长矛。尽管他的 AT 力场不及初号机强大，但他成功地让那台 EVA 机体停滞了几秒，随后初号机用左拳猛击其胸膛。

Slamming Unit 01's feet into the ground, it skidded forward several feet until it was directly beneath the falling Eva Unit. Unit 01 threw both its arm up into the air, the ends of its fingers pointed upwards, ready to catch the Eva Unit. The Eva Unit tried turning around in the air at the last minute, but the mangled wing prevent it from flipping over properly.  
猛地将零一号机的双脚踏入地面，它向前滑行了数尺，直至正好位于坠落的 EVA 单位正下方。零一号机双臂高举向天，指尖朝上，准备接住 EVA 单位。EVA 单位试图在最后一刻在空中转身，但扭曲的机翼阻止了它正确翻转。

Like the sound of rubber being slapped against skin, Unit 01's fingers pierced directly through the back of the Eva Unit, its fingers entwining around the spinal cord of the enemy. Raising its arms even further up into the air, Unit 01 projected its AT-field between the spot where its fingers had sunk in.  
如同橡胶拍打在皮肤上的声音，零一号机的手指直接刺穿了 EVA 单位的后背，指尖缠绕在敌人的脊椎上。零一号机将双臂更进一步举向空中，在其手指插入的位置之间投射出 AT 力场。

The flesh of the enemy was torn asunder, splitting in between the gap that separated Unit 01's fingers. The body was ripped open, spilling organs and blood over the head of Unit 01, bathing it in a dark reddish color, making it look almost like Unit 02. Unit 01 pulled its fingers out of the Eva Unit, making the severed body fall on either side of itself.  
敌人的血肉被撕裂，沿着零一号机手指间的缝隙裂开。身体被撕开，内脏和血液喷涌而出，洒在零一号机的头部，使其沐浴在暗红色中，看起来几乎像是零二号机。零一号机抽出手指，使被切断的身体分别落在两侧。

"Five more," mumbled Shinji as he looked at the remaining Eva Units.  
“再五个。”真嗣咕哝着，目光扫过剩下的 Eva 机体。

The seven of them reached the top of the stairway and were met with a grizzly scene. What looked like a bloodied handprint was plastered on the other side of the doors window. It was smeared towards the bottom, making it apparent that the person had slid to the floor likely after dying.  
他们七人爬上楼梯顶端，眼前是一幕令人毛骨悚然的景象。门上的窗户上似乎印着一个血手印，血迹向下拖曳，显然那人是在死后滑落到地板上的。

Kaji nodded to Misato once before walking up the remaining stairs and crouched down next to the door. From his position he could see Misato watching him worriedly and Asuka behind her who looked positively frightened. Taking a deep breath, and grasping the drawn pistol tightly in his hands, he poked his head upwards and looked through the window briefly.  
加持向美里点头示意后，继续走上剩余的楼梯，蹲在门旁。从他的位置可以看到美里担忧地注视着他，而她身后的明日香则明显惊恐万分。加持深吸一口气，紧握着手中的手枪，小心翼翼地探头透过窗户快速扫视了一眼。

Looking past the bloodied handprint, a body was slumped against the opposite wall, an employee of Nerv. The face was completely disfigured, looking as though it had met a baseball bat. Beside him lay a standard issue 9mm pistol that all personal of Nerv that stayed behind during the assault were given. Blood was smeared all around the spot where the body lay, and Kaji suspected that the bloodied handprint had been this persons. Kaji couldn't imagine the suffering that this person had gone through, just because of the selfish actions of several individuals.  
透过血迹斑斑的手印，可以看到一个人瘫倒在对面墙上，是 NERV 的员工。他的脸完全变形，仿佛遭遇了棒球棍的重击。他身旁躺着一把标配的 9 毫米手枪，这是所有在袭击期间留守的 NERV 人员所配备的。尸体周围血迹斑斑，Kaji 猜测那血手印可能就是此人的。Kaji 难以想象这个人经历了怎样的痛苦，仅仅因为几个人的自私行为。

Turning back to Misato, he nodded his head once and waved them over to him. They walked slowly up the stairs, being careful not to let their feet catch on the metal steps. As Misato reached the stairs, with Asuka and the security behind her, she asked him, "Whats it like out there?"  
他转回身对 Misato 点了点头，示意他们过来。他们小心翼翼地走上楼梯，生怕脚被金属台阶绊住。当 Misato 带着 Asuka 和保安人员到达楼梯时，她问他：“外面情况怎么样？”

"I'm not sure since I cant see very far out that window. There way be nothing out there...but there may also be the enemy."  
“我不太确定，因为从那扇窗户看不了多远。外面可能什么都没有...但也可能有敌人。”

Misato bit down on her lip and then looked behind her at the security personal gathered there. Nodding once, they understood what she was talking about.  
美里咬了咬嘴唇，然后回头看向聚集在那里的安保人员。她点了点头，他们立刻明白了她的意思。

Couching low to the ground, the four walked towards before one in front motioned to the others surrounding him. Giving several signs that Asuka didn't understand, the one in front eventually grasped the door knob of the emergency door, and trust it open, walking out into the hallway.  
四人匍匐前进，为首的一人向周围的人打了个手势。尽管明日香看不懂这些信号，但为首的那人最终还是握住了紧急出口的门把手，推开门，走进了走廊。

All too suddenly, an eruption of gunfire sounded from either end of the hallway. The leader of the team went down almost instantly, a bullet ripping through his trachea and out the other side, creating geyser of blood. Seeing there partner fall to the floor, the others opened fire on one side of the hallway, using the door that swung outwards as a guard from the other side of the hallway. Though lightly armed with 9mm pistols, the security guards of Nerv had been trained well. They could hit an egg from fifty yards out, so a human head from only ten yards was nothing.  
突然间，走廊两端爆发出枪声。队伍的领头人几乎立刻倒下，一颗子弹贯穿了他的气管，从另一侧喷涌出鲜血。看到同伴倒地，其他人立即向走廊一侧开火，利用向外摆动的门作为另一侧的掩护。尽管只配备了 9 毫米手枪，NERV 的安保人员训练有素。他们能在五十码外击中一个鸡蛋，因此从十码外击中一个人头简直是小菜一碟。

The three soldiers on the other side of the hallway were met by a furious rain of bullets. One of them instantly dropped dead after the security guard had fallen, his head exploding like a watermelon. The other took a bullet in his leg and shuffled off to the side, radioing his fellow soldiers on the other side of the hallway. He was apparently the leader of the group, because he told them to move in on the door and take out the security guard.  
走廊另一侧的三名士兵遭遇了猛烈的弹雨。其中一名在保安倒下后瞬间毙命，头部如同西瓜般爆裂。另一名士兵腿部中弹，蹒跚着退到一旁，用无线电联络走廊另一端的战友。显然他是这群人的领导者，因为他命令他们向门口推进，消灭那名保安。

The four soldiers on the other side of the hallway started moving forward, inching slowly towards the door with their guns drawn. The in front waved to the others, and the three behind him took out three grenades, intending to lob them over the door. That was when they were met by a few grenades, courtesy of Kaji. He had given them to the security guards, so that when a lapse in the fire happened, they were able to lob them over the door. The soldiers immediately seeing, started scampering backwards, but they were too late.  
走廊另一侧的四名士兵开始向前移动，缓缓逼近门口，枪已上膛。为首的士兵向其他人挥手示意，他身后的三人随即掏出三枚手榴弹，准备投掷过门。就在这时，他们遭遇了几枚手榴弹的回击，这是加持提供给保安的，以便在火力间隙时能投掷过门。士兵们立刻意识到危险，开始仓皇后退，但为时已晚。

The grenade exploded, instantly disfiguring the soldiers and burning most of their skin charcoal. They looked as though they had acquired leprosy.  
手榴弹爆炸，士兵们瞬间面目全非，大部分皮肤被烧成焦炭。他们看起来仿佛患上了麻风病。

With the soldiers on the one side of the hallway killed, the security team pressed harder against the right side. The leader, having lost more than half the strength of his small company, was forced to retreat, leaving Misato and the others a clear field.  
随着走廊一侧的士兵被歼灭，安保团队更加紧逼右侧。队长损失了超过半数的小队力量，被迫撤退，为美里和其他人留下了开阔的战场。

The security team inched out further into the hallway, making sure that there weren't any secondaries, when the motioned for the other to follow them.  
安保团队小心翼翼地深入走廊，确保没有次要威胁，然后示意其他人跟上。

"Good work," mumbled Misato as she passed the security guards. "I'm glad that their are still some people that are loyal to Nerv." Looking down at the body of the fallen leader, Misato briefly saluted him, along with the other security guards and Kaji. Asuka didn't really understand the purpose of doing this, but she bowed her head nonetheless. Normally it wouldn't have been something she would have considered, but this person had just given his life to help her. He deserved this much at least.  
“干得好，”美里低声说道，经过安保人员时。“我很高兴还有些人忠于 NERV。”她低头看着倒下的队长，与安保人员和加持一起短暂地向他敬礼。明日香并不完全理解这样做的原因，但她还是低头致意。通常她不会考虑这种事，但这个人刚刚为了帮助她而献出了生命。他至少应得这份敬意。

"All right...lets go," said Kaji after a few moments of silence. The others nodded and started down the right side of the hallway, passing the burned bodies of the soldiers.  
“好吧……我们走，”沉默片刻后，加持说道。其他人点头，沿着走廊右侧前行，经过那些士兵的烧焦尸体。

Suddenly, the sound of bullets was heard all around them as the soldiers from earlier returned with reinforcements. The leader in charge was now furious that his earlier efforts had been thwarted by a mere group security guards. Even the kid who was with them wouldn't be shown mercy.  
突然，四周响起了子弹的呼啸声，先前的士兵带着增援回来了。指挥官此刻怒不可遏，因为他的先前努力竟被一群保安轻易挫败。就连那个和他们在一起的孩子也不会得到宽恕。

As the rain of bullets hit them again, one of the security guards immediately went down, catching a bullet in his upper thigh. Whipping around, the remaining two security guards started firing at the enemy, but the were grievously outnumbered. Knowing that they didn't have any other options, one of the security guards yelled to Misato over the sound of flying metal and said, "Let us deal with these guys. You continue on with Kaji and get the pilot of Unit 02 to the ventilation ducts.  
"当子弹如雨点般再次袭来，一名保安立刻倒下，大腿上中了一枪。剩下的两名保安迅速转身，开始向敌人射击，但他们明显寡不敌众。意识到别无选择，其中一名保安在金属飞溅的声响中向美里喊道：“我们来对付这些人。你继续和加持一起，把二号机驾驶员带到通风管道去。”

Misato opened her mouth as though she didn't think very much of this plan, but Kaji put a hand on her shoulder and shook his head, indicting that they understood what they were getting themselves into when they stayed behind.  
美里张开嘴，似乎对这个计划并不十分看好，但加持把手放在她肩上，摇了摇头，示意他们明白留下来意味着什么。

Nodding once, Misato quickly saluted them before turning to Asuka, grabbing her upper arm in a vice like grip and steering towards the direction of the ducts; Kaji was right behind them.  
美里点了点头，迅速向他们敬了个礼，然后转向明日香，用铁钳般的手抓住她的上臂，朝通风管道方向拉去；加持紧随其后。

After many more minutes of running, during which they had to briefly pause as Asuka was complaining about a stitch in her side, they finally made it to the ventilation ducts. It was just big enough to admit Asuka, but Misato and Kaji had no chance of squeezing through the small hole in the side of the metal plating. But then again, they never intended to follow her any farther than here.  
又跑了好几分钟，期间他们不得不短暂停下，因为明日香抱怨侧腹疼痛，他们终于到达了通风管道。管道刚好够明日香通过，但美里和加持根本无法挤过金属板侧面的小洞。不过话说回来，他们从未打算跟她走得更远。

"Is this it?" asked Asuka after she saw the inside of it. Her voice held disgust, as it looked like the ducts hadn't been cleaned out in a while.  
"这就是全部了吗？" 明日香看到内部后问道。她的声音中带着厌恶，看起来这些管道已经很久没有清理过了。

"Not having seconds thoughts, are you?" asked Misato with a slight smile.  
"没有后悔吧？" 美里微微一笑问道。

"No...but," mumbled Asuka as she got on her hands and knees to look inside the duct. "I imagined it being a little more...cleaner."  
"没有……但是，" 明日香一边跪下用手和膝盖爬进管道，一边嘟囔着，"我原本以为会更……干净一些。"

"Can't be picky about it, and its a bit late to turn back."  
"不能挑剔了，现在回头也太晚了。"

"I know," sighed Asuka, as she stood up and looked at Misato and Kaji.  
"我知道，"明日香叹了口气，站起身来看着美里和加持。"

"You are coming with me...aren't you?"  
"你会跟我一起去的……对吧？"

Misato and Kaji simply smiled back at her. Somewhere deep down, Asuka had expected this, but it didn't make it any easier to accept.  
美里和加持只是对她回以微笑。在内心深处，明日香早已预料到这一点，但这并没有让接受变得更容易。

"So you're not...huh..." “所以你们不是……嗯……”

"I'm sorry Asuka, but we can't even fit through the duct," said Kaji.  
“对不起，明日香，但我们根本钻不进通风管道，”加持说道。

"Then we'll just find another way and-"  
"那我们就另寻他法，然后——"

"Asuka, you've already made up your mind on this. I also made up my mind to trust you, so don't worry what happens to us."  
"明日香，你已经下定决心了。我也决定相信你，所以不用担心我们的事。"

"But-" "但——"

"No more. Get going. You said before that Shinji needs help, and I think he does, but from you, and I also think you know that."  
"别再说了。快去吧。你之前说过真嗣需要帮助，我也认为他确实需要，但得由你来帮，而且我想你也明白这一点。"

Asuka shrugged, not quite knowing yet one way or another.  
明日香耸了耸肩，还不太确定是哪一种情况。

"But what are you two going to do?" she asked hesitantly, unsure of whether she wanted to know the answer or not.  
“但你们俩打算怎么办？”她犹豫地问道，不确定自己是否真的想知道答案。

"We'll manage somehow," said Misato with something that looked like a forced smile.  
“我们总会想办法的，”美里带着一种看似勉强的微笑说道。

"After all this, we'll meet up again and go out for dinner, how does that sound?" asked Kaji.  
"毕竟经历了这么多，我们再聚一聚出去吃个饭，听起来怎么样？" 加持问道。

Asuka thought about this for a moment, before smiling slightly, the features of her face changing significantly.  
明日香想了一会儿，然后微微一笑，脸上的表情明显变化了。

"Yeah, that does sound nice," she said  
"嗯，听起来确实不错，" 她说

"Alright then, its a promise," said Misato. "Now hurry up. Shinji started fighting the massed produced Eva Units a while ago."  
"好吧，那就一言为定，" 美里说道。"现在快点。真嗣已经开始与量产型 EVA 单位战斗了。"

"I know," mumbled Asuka as she turned away from Kaji and Misato, but just as she was about to enter the duct, she turned and told Misato, "I'm glad that I was able to live with you for this short time. It was...almost like having a mother again..."  
"我知道，" 明日香低声嘟囔着，转身离开加持和美里，但就在她即将进入管道时，她转过身对美里说，"我很高兴能在这短暂的时间里与你一起生活。这感觉...几乎像是再次拥有了母亲..."

Misato couldn't let on how deeply Asuka's words affected her, because if she did, she might hold Asuka back.  
美里不能表现出明日香的话对她影响有多深，因为如果她表现出来，可能会拖住明日香。

"Thank you Asuka...now hurry! Go!"  
"谢谢你，明日香...现在快点！走吧！"

Asuka nodded once before ducking down in the ventilation ducts and crawling slowly through it. Slowly, the shape of her form was lost to Misato and Kaji as she crawled into the depths of Nerv.  
明日香点了点头，随即弯腰钻进通风管道，缓慢地爬行其中。渐渐地，她的身影在美里和加持的视线中消失，深入了 NERV 的深处。

"I suppose we should cover this up," said Kaji first to speak since Asuka left.  
"我想我们应该把这里掩盖起来，" 加持是明日香离开后第一个开口说话的人。

"...Right," said Misato meekly. She had now not only lost Shinji, but Asuka too. She was no longer in control of their lives, if she ever had been. They had grown up together in her apartment, and she had been able to witness the changes in them sprout. It had happened all so fast, that she wished that it had never happened, that they would have stayed young and oblivious forever. But everyone must grow up at one point in their lives, and it was no different for her.  
"...好吧，" 美里怯生生地说道。她现在不仅失去了真嗣，连明日香也失去了。她不再能掌控他们的生活，如果她曾经有过这种能力的话。他们一起在她公寓里长大，她见证了他们成长的点点滴滴。这一切发生得太快，她希望这一切从未发生过，希望他们永远年轻、懵懂无知。但每个人总有一天必须长大，这对她来说也不例外。

"I wonder what will happen to those two," mumbled Misato after her and Kaji fixed the metal plating that they had taken off back on the duct. It blended in so well with the wall, only somebody that knew the layout of Nerv would be able to find it.  
"我在想那两个孩子会怎么样，" 美里在她和加持将拆下的金属板重新固定在管道上后喃喃自语。它与墙壁融为一体，只有熟悉 NERV 布局的人才能找到它。

"No clue," mumbled Kaji as he started lighting a cigarette but looked at it distastefully suddenly and threw it to the floor. "What ever their futures are though, I don't think that we'll have a part in it."  
"不知道，" 加持咕哝着，开始点燃一支烟，但突然厌恶地看着它，把它扔到了地上。"无论他们的未来如何，我想我们都不会在其中扮演角色。"

"Its not very likely," sighed Misato.  
"可能性不大," 美里叹息道。

"Should we get on with it then?" asked Kaji.  
"那我们继续吧？" 加持问道。

"I suppose," replied Misato.  
"我想是的," 美里回答。

Together, the two of them turn towards the way they had come from, certain that the soldiers would eventually reach there position. It was too much to hope that they wouldn't discover the ventilation duct and try to find a way to break through it. Therefore, they had to hold off the enemy long enough for Asuka to escape with Unit 02.  
两人一起转身面向他们来时的路，确信士兵们最终会到达他们的位置。指望他们不会发现通风管道并试图找到突破口，这希望太过渺茫。因此，他们必须拖住敌人足够长的时间，让明日香带着二号机逃脱。

"I didn't think things would be like this...this end," mumbled Misato dejectedly.  
“我没想到事情会变成这样...这样的结局，”美里沮丧地喃喃自语。

"Its not so bad," said Kaji, "we're together...aren't we?"  
“也没那么糟，”加持说，“我们在一起...不是吗？”

Misato turned to him and looked him in the eyes before smiling slightly and entwining her fingers in his.  
美里转向他，直视他的眼睛，微微一笑，手指轻轻缠绕在他的指间。

"Yeah, I suppose that is something."  
“是啊，我想那确实很重要。”

Passing out of depth of knowledge, the two waited for there eventual ending.  
在知识的深渊边缘徘徊，两人等待着最终的结局。

All around Asuka was darkness, but that wasn't all. There was a certain sense of claustrophobia, being captured, your wings and freedom broken. It reminder her of her repulsive years spent under her father's roof. But the thoughts of Misato and Kaji's sacrifice, and her own determination kept her will strong, until eventually she could see a small light at the end of what felt like a long tunnel.  
四周一片漆黑，但这并非全部。一种幽闭恐惧感油然而生，仿佛被囚禁，翅膀和自由都被折断。这让她想起了在父亲屋檐下度过的那些令人厌恶的岁月。但想到美里和加持的牺牲，以及自己的决心，她的意志依旧坚定，直到最终她能看见隧道尽头的一丝微光。

As she reached the light, she realized that there was some sort of grate at the end of the duct. Kicking out with both her feet, she managed to pop the grate off until the light was shinning fully into the mouth of the duct. Poking her head out of the duct, she could see the entirety of the Evangelion chamber, or what was left of it. Both sides of the chamber where the elevators had been were completely buried with twisted pieces of metal. The barriers that had held Unit 01 in place were twisted and flung all over the place like the playthings of a toddler. Her eyes though went to her own Eva Unit, first and foremost.  
当她接近那束光时，她意识到通风口尽头有一个格栅。她用双脚猛踢，终于将格栅踢开，直到光线完全照进通风口。她探出头，可以看到整个 EVA 机库的全貌，或者说它残存的部分。两侧原本是电梯的地方完全被扭曲的金属碎片掩埋。固定初号机的屏障扭曲变形，四处散落，如同被顽童玩耍的玩具。然而，她的目光首先落在了自己的 EVA 机体上。

It was of course still in its damaged state that had happened when Shinji had fought it, but she had been rather hopeful that it would have somehow repaired itself, much like Unit 02. But it seemed that her Unit didn't have any such special powers.  
当然，它仍处于与真嗣战斗时受损的状态，但她曾相当乐观地认为它会像二号机那样自行修复。然而，似乎她的零号机并没有这种特殊能力。

Lowering herself down onto the metal ladder that was used as an emergency access, she slowly starting climbing down until she landed on the central walkway. Much of it had been destroyed when Unit 01 had left, so Asuka had to be careful she didn't fall off the rickety rail. Moving carefully along the right side of it, she eventually came to a bit of a problem. The gangway that her Unit 02 was positioned on was impossible to get to, because the intersection of the two walkways had been destroyed. Asuka wondered if Shinji hadn't purposefully done that when he left.  
她缓缓地从作为紧急出口的金属梯子下降，直到踏上中央通道。大部分区域在初号机离开时已被摧毁，因此明日香必须小心，以免从摇摇欲坠的栏杆上跌落。她谨慎地沿着右侧前行，最终遇到了一个难题。她的二号机所在的通道无法到达，因为两条通道的交汇处已被破坏。明日香怀疑这是否是真嗣离开时故意为之。

'He's still not stopping me though,' she thought  
“但他依然无法阻止我，”她心想

Grabbing ahold of the metal railing, she hoisted her right foot onto the top of the railing and then swung her left leg up also, being sure to hold onto the railing with her hands all the while. It looked as though she was about to do a high dive into a pool, and was just bending her knees to get ready. Though in reality, what she was doing wasn't very smart.  
她紧紧抓住金属栏杆，将右脚抬到栏杆顶部，随后左腿也跟着翻越，双手始终紧握栏杆。看起来她正准备做一个高台跳水，膝盖微微弯曲，准备起跳。但实际上，她的行为并不明智。

Bracing herself for the jump, she gave a brief silent prayer before she leapt. Though not seeming to care what others thought, Asuka was fairly athletic, so it was probably this single thing that saved her. During her brief time at the middle school she attended here in Tokyo-3, she was always top in her P.E. class.  
在跳跃前，她默默祈祷了一瞬，尽管似乎并不在意他人的看法。阿斯卡相当擅长运动，这或许是她得以幸免的唯一原因。在东京-3 就读的中学期间，她在体育课上总是名列前茅。

She jumped a good five feet out into the unknown without a running start or anything, just complete stationary jump. She didn't look down, which was probably for the best, because then she may have not made it.  
她从原地跳出约五英尺，没有助跑，纯粹是静止跳跃。她没有向下看，这或许是最好的选择，因为一旦低头，她可能就无法完成这一跳。

Both her hands fastened onto the railing on the opposite side, clinging to it for dear life until she managed to hoist herself up, and swing her legs over the other side. Sliding down to the ground, she let out a sigh of relief over what she had done.  
她双手紧紧抓住对面的栏杆，拼尽全力抓牢，直到设法将自己拉起，双腿跨过另一侧。滑落到地面，她对自己所做的一切松了一口气。

'I must be crazy...doing something like this,' she thought.  
'我一定是疯了...做这种事，'她心想。

Tilting her head upward, she looked up into the face of Unit 02.  
她抬头仰望，目光落在二号机上。

"Hey...its been a while..." she said to it as though expecting it to respond. It didn't of course.  
“嘿...好久不见...”她对它说道，仿佛期待着它的回应。当然，它并没有。

Standing up, she turned to it and said, "I'm going to be relying on you again...so I need you to work for me..."  
她站起身，转向它说道：“我将再次依赖你...所以我需要你为我工作...”

'Dear God, am I actually talking to my Eva Unit?' She thought she was becoming insane.  
‘天哪，我居然在和我的 Eva 机体说话？’她觉得自己快要疯了。

Walking over to the side of it, she briefly thought about searching for a plug suit, any for that matter, but disregarded it in the end. She didn't have time for that, and she should be able to pilot it without one anyway.  
她走到一旁，短暂地考虑过寻找一件插入栓服，任何一件都行，但最终还是放弃了。她没有时间做这些，而且无论如何，她应该能够不穿插入栓服就驾驶它。

Climbing the ladder that led to the entry plug, she paused for a moment outside the entry plug. If she was honest with herself, she was not looking forward to entering Unit 02. She had gotten used to not piloting and could hardly remember even doing it now. But she made a promise to herself and Misato that she would see this through.  
她爬上通往驾驶舱的梯子，在驾驶舱外停顿了一下。如果她对自己诚实，她并不期待进入二号机。她已经习惯了不驾驶，现在几乎记不起曾经驾驶的感觉了。但她对自己和美里承诺过，她会坚持到底。

So, taking a deep breath, Asuka entered the entry plug for what would be the last time in her life.  
于是，深吸一口气，明日香走进了驾驶舱，这将是她一生中的最后一次。

Nothing felt as it once had, of which she could barely remember. She was cold, dark, and all alone; there was nothing in there that would comfort her. Unit 02 had completely shut itself off to her because it didn't recognize her. She was different than the Asuka of the past, the one that had needed the sanctuary of Unit 02.  
一切都已不复从前，她几乎记不清曾经的模样。她感到寒冷、黑暗，孤身一人；那里没有任何东西能给予她慰藉。二号机彻底对她关闭了心扉，因为它没有认出她。她与过去的明日香不同，那个曾经需要二号机庇护的明日香。

"Please work," she mumbled inside the entry plug of Unit 02. "Even if you just walk a little...It'll be fine. Please, I need this. I've finally found something of worth in my life, and I don't want to lose it. At least, I think I've found it. Just this last time...please help me..."  
“请动起来，”她在二号机的插入栓内喃喃自语，“哪怕只是走一小步...都会没事的。求你了，我需要这个。我终于在生命中找到了有价值的东西，我不想失去它。至少，我想我找到了。就这一次...请帮帮我...”

Unit 02 continued its silence, not relenting as the fifteen year old girl pleaded for help.  
二号机依旧沉默，不为十五岁少女的恳求所动。

"I don't know what happened before, I can't remember it, and something happened to you when I wasn't around. I'm sorry for all that. I'm sorry for the way I treated you, but I've learned the importance of having friends, and I even enjoy spending time with them. I don't want to go back to what I was! I don't want that kind sadness to envelope me like it used!"  
"我不知道之前发生了什么，我记不起来了，而且我不在的时候你发生了一些事。我为这一切感到抱歉。我为我对待你的方式道歉，但我已经明白了拥有朋友的重要性，甚至享受与他们共度的时光。我不想回到过去的样子！我不希望那种悲伤再次笼罩我！"

Unit 02 continued its silence, its soul closed off to Asuka.  
02 号机继续保持沉默，它的灵魂对明日香封闭了。

"I don't care about anything else. I don't care if I discover the missing pieces of my memories. I don't care if I learn the significance of those I earrings that comfort me so. Just right now, I want to help the person that is fighting all alone, like me. I don't know how, but I want to help him. I don't want him to die! He's-"  
"我不在乎其他任何事。我不在乎是否能找回我记忆中缺失的片段。我不在乎是否能了解那些让我感到安慰的 I 耳环的意义。现在，我只想要帮助那个像我一样独自战斗的人。我不知道该怎么做，但我想帮助他。我不希望他死去！他——"

Asuka suddenly felt a chill travel down her spine as the inside of the entry plug flashed white for a brief instance. When Asuka opened her eyes that she had closed when the flash of white happened, she was looking down at a much younger version of herself. She had to be only about four. But slowly, Asuka's eyes traveled to the woman was crouching low above her four year old self. She was patting her on the head while wearing a smile on her face. She had long flowing hair that was similar to her own, and it reached just above her waist. Her eyes were the same color of blue, and when she stood up, Asuka noticed that there features were somewhat similar.  
明日香突然感到一阵寒意沿着脊背蔓延，插入栓内部瞬间闪过一片白光。当明日香睁开因白光而闭上的眼睛时，她正俯视着年幼的自己。那时的她大约只有四岁。但渐渐地，明日香的目光移向了蹲在四岁自己上方的那位女子。她正微笑着，轻拍着小明日香的头。她的长发如瀑布般流淌，与明日香自己的发丝相似，长度刚好垂至腰间。她的眼睛同样是湛蓝色，当她站起身时，明日香注意到她们的面容有几分相似。

"Mother?" she whispered. “妈妈？”她轻声唤道。

The woman smiled back at Asuka before saying, "Yes, Asuka...I'm glad to see you, even if its for a short while."  
女子对明日香回以微笑，说道：“是的，明日香……很高兴见到你，即使只是短暂的时光。”

"What are you doing here...I mean-" Asuka started frantically, but her mother held up a hand to silence her. Asuka couldn't remember her mother very well, but she did remember the hand, and the stern expression that followed. But her mother was still smiling.  
"你在这里做什么...我是说——" 明日香慌乱地开口，但她母亲举起一只手示意她安静。明日香对母亲的记忆并不深刻，但她记得那只手，以及随之而来的严肃表情。不过，母亲依然面带微笑。

"Its fine Asuka. You don't need to get so tense."  
"没事的，明日香。你不必这么紧张。"

"But what are you-" "但你这是——"

"As for what I'm doing here, you should be able to figure that out already."  
"至于我为什么会在这里，你应该已经能猜到了。"

Asuka gaped openly for a few seconds before she asked, "Are you...the soul of my Unit 02?"  
绫波愣了几秒后问道：“你是……02 号机的灵魂吗？”

"Correct. After Yui's accident, I was asked to run a similar experiment, though I told them I wouldn't, I didn't want to leave you behind with only your father incase something happened to me."  
"没错。在唯发生事故后，他们让我进行类似的实验，虽然我告诉他们我不会做，但我也不想留下你和你父亲独自面对万一我出事的情况。"

"But you still did. Were you forced!"  
"但你还是做了。你是被迫的吗！"

"No, I wasn't. In the end, it was my own decision that did it, and I suppose a little of Yui also."  
"不，我没有。最终，是我自己的决定，我想还有一点是受 Yui 的影响。"

"Yui? You mean Shinji's mother?"  
"Yui？你是说真嗣的母亲吗？"

"I'm glad you know about her, and him of course. I assume you know about his connection with the angels."  
"我很高兴你知道她，当然还有他。我猜你知道他和天使们的联系。"

Asuka paused for a minute before she said, "I do...but, you're making it sound as though you know him."  
明日香顿了一下，然后说："我确实知道...但是，你这么说好像你很了解他。"

"I do, I met him several times when me and his mother were working together, but I met him recently also."  
"我确实了解，我和他母亲一起工作时见过他几次，最近也见过他。"

"What? When?" “什么？什么时候？”

"When he fought me while I was under the influence of the seventeenth angel. I broke out of Tabris's control though, and fought him with my own will. I wanted to see what kind of man he was growing into because you see, Yui told me when Shinji was only two years old about his real father. I was one of the very few who knew her secret."  
“在他与我对抗的时候，那时我正受到第十七使徒的影响。但我挣脱了塔布里斯（Tabris）的控制，凭借自己的意志与他战斗。我想看看他成长为了怎样的男人，因为你知道，Yui 在他只有两岁时就告诉了我关于他亲生父亲的事。我是极少数知道她秘密的人之一。”

"But...why were you curious about him?"  
“但是……你为什么对他感到好奇呢？”

Asuka's mother watched her for a few seconds before she said, "Because I wanted to know what you saw in him."  
明日香的母亲注视了她几秒钟，然后说道：“因为我想知道你看中了他哪一点。”

Asuka spluttered a little at that.  
明日香对此有点语塞。

"What I saw in hi...what are you talking about!"  
我看中了他哪...你在说什么啊！

Asuka's mother frowned for a few seconds before she said, "I forgot, you don't remember everything yet, not clearly enough at least."  
明日香的母亲皱眉了几秒钟，然后说：“我忘了，你还没完全记起来，至少记得不够清楚。”

"What do you mean what I saw in him? That idiot is self centered, cynical, rude, and an all around ass!"  
“你说的我看到他是什么意思？那个白痴以自我为中心，愤世嫉俗，粗鲁无礼，整个一混蛋！”

Asuka's mother shook her head at that.  
明日香的母亲对此摇了摇头。

"Shinji is very different than that, though admittedly his angel half has changed a good portion of who he was, but he is essentially still the same person."  
"尽管不可否认他的天使半身改变了他许多，但真嗣实际上仍然是同一个人，与那截然不同。"

"Mother, I don't-" "妈妈，我不——"

"Who is Shinji to you Asuka? Why do you care what happens to him when you've never cared about anyone else so strongly, and trust me, I know. Through the eyes of Unit 02, I've watched you as you've grown, and I'm mostly pleased with what I saw. But you were too closed off from everyone else, you hated people."  
"对于你来说，真嗣是谁，明日香？为什么你如此关心他的遭遇，你从未对其他人如此上心，相信我，我了解。通过二号机的眼睛，我见证了你的成长，我大多感到欣慰。但你太过封闭自己，对他人充满恨意。"

"But thats because-" "但那是因为-"

"Because nobody loved you," mumbled Asuka's mother, "and I blame myself for that, because I wasn't around for you...and your father..."  
"因为没有人爱你，" 明日香的母亲喃喃道，"我为此责怪自己，因为我没有在你身边...还有你父亲..."

She paused there, unsure how she should continue. Asuka still had no idea about how Shinji had completely crippled her father when he had arrived at Misato's apartment to take her away.  
她说到这里停了下来，不知道该如何继续。明日香仍然不知道真嗣是如何在他来到美里公寓带走她时，彻底击垮了她父亲的。

"But now you've met people who genuinely care for you," she said, glossing over the brief mention of her father. "And I'm glad of that, but at the same time sad, because you no longer need the comfort of Unit 02. The feeling you had before, the warmth, was my warmth. The warmth of a mother. But as your thoughts and feelings drifted and grew stronger, the warmth diminished as a new warmth sprung forth and started to blossom."  
"但如今你遇到了真正关心你的人，"她轻描淡写地略过了父亲短暂的提及。"我为此感到高兴，同时又有些悲伤，因为你不再需要 02 号机的慰藉。你之前感受到的温暖，是我的温暖，一个母亲的温暖。但随着你的思绪和情感飘散并愈发强烈，那份温暖逐渐消退，新的温暖开始萌发并绽放。"

"I'm not abandoning you!"  
"我没有要抛弃你！"

"No, you're not, but you're moving on, and I'm proud of you Asuka. You've grown into a beautiful woman who can handle herself. I can hardly think of what you will look like in five years, but I imagine it will be something like a younger version of myself."  
"不，你没有，但你正在向前走，我为你感到骄傲，明日香。你已经成长为一个能够独当一面的美丽女性。我几乎无法想象五年后的你会是什么样子，但我猜想，那大概会像年轻时的我吧。"

"...That wouldn't be so bad," said Asuka. She had always wondered what she would look like older, and this was as clear an example as any.  
"...那不会太糟，" 明日香说。她一直好奇自己长大后会是什么样子，而现在这个例子再清楚不过了。

Asuka stared at her four year old self who was now curled up in a ball and sleeping at mothers feet when she thought of something.  
明日香盯着她四岁时的自己，那个小身影现在蜷缩成一团，在母亲脚边睡着了，这时她想到了什么。

"You said you fought Shinji before...you must have talked with him."  
"你说过你之前和真嗣打过架...你一定和他谈过话。"

"I did, and at first he mistook me for you...and older version if you will. I was actually rather...rough with him, testing what he was capable of. After he found out it was me though, he couldn't bring himself to destroy Unit 02, knowing how much it meant to you. Even earlier, when Misato told him to destroy me, he refused, saying that it was something he could never do."  
"我确实这么做了，起初他误以为我是你……一个更年长的版本。我其实对他相当……粗暴，测试他的能力极限。但当他发现是我后，他无法下决心摧毁二号机，因为他知道这对你意味着什么。甚至在更早的时候，当美里命令他摧毁我时，他拒绝了，说那是他永远做不到的事。"

"...Why...why does he care about me so much?"  
"……为什么……他为什么这么在乎我？"

Asuka's mother looked at her evenly for a few seconds before she said, "Thats something you'll have to ask him yourself, but whether he decides to reply is entirely up to him. He still has a say in this after all."  
明日香的母亲平静地看了她几秒钟，然后说：“这问题你得亲自问他，但他的回答与否完全取决于他自己。毕竟，他仍有发言权。”

"But how am I even supposed to help him with Unit 02 in this state?"  
"但就我现在这样，怎么可能帮得了 02 号机呢？"

"Leave that to me, a hundred percent sync ratio will be easy now that you've learned I'm here, and Unit 02 isn't as crippled as one might think. It is after all the combat model."  
"交给我吧，既然你已经知道我在，百分百同步率现在对你来说轻而易举，而且 02 号机并没有看上去那么不堪。毕竟，它可是战斗机型。"

"Mom?" "妈妈？"

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"After this...after everything...will I see you again?"  
“在这之后……经历了这一切……我还能再见到你吗？”

Asuka's mother stood their for a minute before shaking her head and said, "I don't know. Probably not, but only Lilith at this point would know. Yui and I are tied to the Evangelions now, and even if we had a body to return to, I don't think are souls would."  
绫波的母亲在那里站了一会儿，然后摇摇头说：“我不知道。可能不会了，但只有莉莉丝现在才知道。我和唯现在与 EVA 绑定在一起了，即使我们有身体可以回去，我想我们的灵魂也不会。”

"So this is...goodbye?" "所以这就是...告别吗？"

Asuka's mother smiled at that.  
明日香的母亲听到这话笑了。

"Of course not silly. Just remember, that whenever you're lonely, or sad, and the person you care for is not beside you, remember that I'm always here."  
"当然不是，傻孩子。只要记住，无论何时你感到孤独或悲伤，而你关心的人不在你身边，记住我永远在这里。"

At the word here, Asuka's mother placed her right hand over Asuka's heart before embracing her strongly, her hands wrapping around Asuka's back.  
听到“这里”这个词，明日香的母亲将右手放在明日香的心口，然后紧紧地拥抱着她，双手环绕在明日香的背上。

"I'm gonna miss you Asuka," she said.  
“我会想你的，明日香，”她说。

"I'm gonna miss you too mother," replied Asuka.  
“我也会想你的，妈妈，”明日香回答道。

Slowly the whiteness started to disappear, but not before Asuka saw her four year old self grasping the hand over her mother and waving eagerly at her own retreating self.  
慢慢地，白色开始消失，但在消失之前，明日香看到了四岁时的自己紧握着母亲的手，急切地向正在远去的自己挥手。

'Me as a kid huh?' thought Asuka suddenly as she watched them fade into the distance. 'I've never thought about it much, but when I'm older, will I want children of my own?'  
'小时候的我啊？'明日香突然想到，看着她们消失在远方。'我从未多想过，但当我长大后，我会想要自己的孩子吗？'

But before that thought could take hold in her mind, she was returned to reality.  
但这个念头还没在她心中扎根，她就被拉回了现实。

Asuka opened her eyes in the entry plug of Unit 02 except that it wasn't dark anymore, it was positively bright. Blinking several times, she looked around remembering bits and pieces of the conversation she had had with her mother, but she couldn't remember all of it. But she felt amazing, like she could do anything right.  
明日香在二号机的插入栓中睁开了眼睛，不再是漆黑一片，而是异常明亮。她眨了几次眼，环顾四周，回想起与母亲交谈的片段，但无法记起全部。然而她感觉棒极了，仿佛无所不能。

'My mother is right beside me...always,' she thought.  
“妈妈一直在我身边……永远。”她心想。

Looking ahead, towards the elevator shaft made for the Evangelion Units, she knew that she had to get Unit 02 out of here somehow, and that the elevators were the best bet. Almost at her very thought, Unit 02 responded to her commands and used its working arm to forcefully break the binders holding it in place. Though heavily damaged, and bits of bone and gore poking out of many places of the Eva Unit, Asuka still moved forward in it.  
她望向前方，那是专为福音战士设计的电梯井，她知道必须设法让二号机离开这里，而电梯是最佳选择。几乎在她刚想到这一点时，二号机便响应了她的指令，用尚能运作的手臂强行挣脱了束缚。尽管机体严重受损，多处露出骨头和血肉，明日香依然操控着它向前移动。

'Who is Shinji to me?' Asuka mouthed the words that her mother had asked her not long ago.  
'真嗣对我来说是谁？' 不久前，她的母亲问过她这个问题，而明日香此刻正无声地重复着这些话。

'Who is he to me?' she wondered  
'他对我来说是谁？' 她心中疑惑着

Shinji let out a sigh to clear his mind as he stood in the middle of the circle the five remaining Eva Units had created around him. Only five more, and it seemed like an eternity until they would all be defeated.  
真嗣站在五台剩余的 EVA 机体围成的圆圈中央，长叹一声以清空思绪。只剩下五台了，但感觉距离它们全部被击败似乎还有无尽的时光。

Crouching low to the ground, Unit 01 suddenly kicked off against it, splintering the ground that its feet had been placed on. Charging towards the nearest Eva Unit, Unit 01 let out an earsplitting roar just before it sunk its fist into the Eva Units chest. Next second, blood and gore exploded out the back of the Eva Unit as Unit 01's AT-field ripped open a hole in its chest.  
匍匐在地，01 号机突然发力，将其脚下的地面震裂。它向最近的 EVA 单位冲去，在拳头击中 EVA 单位胸膛前发出震耳欲聋的咆哮。紧接着，鲜血与内脏从 EVA 单位背部喷涌而出，01 号机的 AT 力场在其胸口撕开了一个大洞。

Quickly turning to the other Eva Units, Unit 01 was forced to dodge out of the way, as one of them thrust a spear towards him. Shifting around the one that had tried to stab him, Unit 01 quickly projected its AT-field as the fists of another came to smashed Unit 01's head open. The clash of flesh against AT-field sent out a discharge of energy, creating a small explosion in the vicinity which kicked of dust and debris.  
01 号机迅速转向其他 EVA 单位，被迫闪避，因为其中一台正持矛刺向他。它绕过试图刺伤它的那台，迅速展开 AT 力场，另一台的拳头正要砸开 01 号机的头部。肉体与 AT 力场的碰撞释放出能量，引发了一场小规模的爆炸，扬起了周围的尘土和碎片。

Skidding backwards from the explosion, just as Unit 01 looked up, it was forced to project its AT-field again as one of Eva Units thrust the spear towards him. But at the last second, Shinji made Unit 01 drop the AT-field and instead grabbed the spear with its hands. It was a wise choice on his part, as next second, the shape of the spear changed shape, into something he had seen before. But it was different, a blackish color instead of the red one he could remember.  
从爆炸中倒滑而出，正当初号机抬头之际，另一台 EVA 的矛尖逼近，迫使它再次展开 AT 力场。但在最后一刻，真嗣指挥初号机撤去力场，转而用双手抓住了长矛。这一决策颇为明智，因为下一秒，矛的形态发生了变化，变成了他曾见过的样子。不过有所不同，这次是深黑色而非记忆中的红色。

"The Lance of Longinus? But how is it here and not still in space?" he wondered. But all the same, he could feel the power that radiated from it now, whether it was the same or different one as before. He knew that if he were pierced by that, no amount of time would fix his battered body.  
“朗基努斯之枪？但它怎么会在这里，而不是仍在太空中？”他疑惑着。但无论是否同一支，此刻他都能感受到其散发出的强大力量。他深知，若被此矛贯穿，无论多少时间也无法修复他那伤痕累累的身体。

Dodging several thrust of the spear, he shifted around the side of the Eva Unit and struck it where the kidney should have been. Almost immediately, the Eva Unit became limp and its grasp on the lance was slackened. Taking this chance, Shinji made Unit 01 drive its fist into the side of the Eva Unit's head, blowing its brains out the other side of its head in the process.  
闪避了数次矛击后，他绕到 EVA 侧面，猛击其肾脏位置。几乎立刻，那台 EVA 便瘫软下来，对长矛的握持也松懈了。趁此机会，真嗣令初号机挥拳重击 EVA 头部，将其脑浆从另一侧轰出。

Seeing another one of their brothers being killed at Unit 01's hands, the remaining Eva Units became furious. Each of their spears turned into an individual Lance of Longinus, and they all soared into the air above Unit 01.  
目睹又一位兄弟在初号机手中丧命，剩余的 EVA 机体怒不可遏。每一柄长矛都化作独立的朗基努斯之枪，它们齐齐冲向初号机上方的天空。

"Shit..." mumbled Shinji just as the three Eva Units threw the three lances at him.  
“该死……”真嗣低声咒骂，就在这时，三台 EVA 机体向他投掷了三柄长枪。

Flipping backwards with Unit 01, Shinji dodged the three lances, but as he looked up, he saw that the three Eva Units were almost on top of him. Kicking outward, he managed to push one of them backwards, but as he saw a blur of movement, he was forced to roll out of the way as one of their AT-fields sliced into the ground where he had just been.  
真嗣操控初号机向后翻腾，避开了三柄长枪，但抬头一看，三台 EVA 机体已近在咫尺。他向外踢出一脚，勉强将其中一台推开，然而眼角余光瞥见一抹模糊的移动，他不得不迅速翻滚，避开了一道刚刚所在位置被 AT 力场切开的地面。

Flipping back up, Unit 01 caught one of their heads just as it was about to bite into its armor again. Twisting it viscously, Shinji felt the bones snap in the Eva Units neck and let it fall flat to the ground.  
翻转回身，初号机在其中一个头颅即将再次咬上装甲的瞬间将其捕获。残忍地扭转，真嗣感受到 EVA 颈部骨骼的断裂，任其瘫软倒地。

The remaining two grabbed the spears which had been sunk into the ground and charged at Unit 01, attempting to stab him multiple times. Managing to dodge all of them, Shinji made Unit 01 bend its back almost all the way to the ground as a spear just passed above his head. Acting quickly, Shinji made Unit 01 thrust its right hand forward and project its AT-field directly through the Eva Units abdomen. A fountain of blood exploded out the back of the Eva Unit as it collapsed on top of Unit 01, pinning him to the ground.  
剩下的两个抓起插在地上的长矛，向初号机冲来，试图多次刺击。真嗣巧妙地躲开了所有攻击，让初号机几乎完全弯腰至地面，一柄长矛恰好从头顶掠过。反应迅速，真嗣指挥初号机向前伸出右手，将 AT 力场直接贯穿 EVA 的腹部。鲜血如喷泉般从 EVA 背部喷涌而出，它倒在了初号机上，将其压在地上。

'Damn,' thought Shinji. 'This thing is crushing me.' It felt like he was being crushed by thousands of pillows and blankets.  
'该死，'真嗣心想，'这东西压得我喘不过气。'感觉就像被成千上万的枕头和毯子压住一样。

Though just as he was pushing the dead Eva Unit off him, he felt the presence of the last one above him. It had the Lance of Longinus in its hand. Seeing the look in the Eva's eyes, Shinji knew he had half a second to prevent a fatale blow as the Eva Unit stabbed downward with the Lance of Longinus. The blow which had been intended for the heart, was shifted slightly by Unit 01's arm, so that instead it pierced the bone just bellow the shoulder of the right arm.  
正当他奋力推开压在身上的 Eva 残骸时，他感觉到头顶上最后一台 Eva 的存在。它手中握着朗基努斯之枪。从 Eva 的眼神中，真嗣明白自己只有半秒钟的时间来阻止致命一击，因为那台 Eva 正持枪向下刺来。原本瞄准心脏的一击，被初号机的手臂稍稍偏移，结果枪尖刺穿了右肩下方的一块骨头。

Pain exploded where the blow had pierced Unit 01's arm and was transferred to Shinji. The lance had pierced straight through Unit 01's arm, meaning that the same thing had happened to Shinji's arm; his right arm was a bloody mess. The hole was so large that you could see right through it and out the other side. The bone had completely been sheared through, completely splintering it and making yellow bone marrow flow out. Shinji had never felt so much agony it his life. But the Eva Unit wasn't done with him yet.  
疼痛在初号机手臂被刺穿的地方爆发，并传递给了真嗣。长枪直接贯穿了初号机的手臂，这意味着真嗣的右臂也遭受了同样的命运；他的右臂血肉模糊。伤口之大，甚至能直接看到对面的景象。骨头被完全切断，碎裂成片，黄色的骨髓随之流出。真嗣一生中从未感受过如此剧烈的痛苦。但那台 Eva 还没有放过他。

Yanking the spear roughly out of Unit 01's arm it brought the spear backwards again was just about ready to thrust it forward. Shinji saw the things tongue perturb out of its mouth as though it was smiling over what it was doing. Throwing its head back into the air, it let out a strange screech before plunging the lance downwards towards Unit 01's and Shinji's heart. Though Shinji attempted to block the attack again, he knew that the attempt would be futile and that this time he would really die. He even welcomed it in a way, he would finally free at least.  
猛地从 01 号机手臂中抽出长矛，它再次将矛向后拉，准备向前刺去。真嗣看到那东西的舌头从嘴里伸出来，仿佛在对自己所做的事情微笑。它将头仰向空中，发出一声奇怪的尖叫，然后向 01 号机和真嗣的心脏猛刺下去。尽管真嗣试图再次阻挡攻击，但他知道这次尝试将是徒劳的，这次他真的会死。在某种程度上，他甚至欢迎死亡，他终于可以解脱了。

But no such thing happened.  
但这样的事情并没有发生。

A flash over orange from somewhere behind suddenly erupted into the vicinity of the Eva Unit which had been about to pierce him. As the brightness vanished though, Shinji saw that the arm which had been surging towards him was completely gone, it had disintegrated. Just as he was about to move though, the Eva Unit dove towards him with its mouth, intending to bite at the jugular and attempting to silence him for good. That was when the second flash of orange erupted, incasing the head of the Eva Unit until the skull exploded, showering Unit 01 its bits of bone and brain matter.  
从某个后方突然爆发出一道橙色的闪光，照亮了原本即将刺穿他的 EVA 机体。然而，当亮度消失时，真嗣看到那只原本向他冲来的手臂已经完全消失，它已经解体了。正当他准备移动时，EVA 机体向他扑来，张嘴试图咬住他的颈动脉，企图永远让他闭嘴。就在这时，第二道橙色闪光爆发，包裹住 EVA 机体的头部，直到头骨爆炸，将骨头和脑浆碎片洒在 01 号机上。

Blinking stupidly for several seconds, Shinji finally got a hold of himself and pushed the dead body of the Eva Unit that had been pinning him to the ground to the side and made Unit 01 stand up, all the way conscious of the gaping wound in his right arm. As he turned around to see what had saved him though, he heard a garbled voice suddenly come over the intercom.  
傻愣了几秒钟后，真嗣终于回过神来，将压在他身上的 Eva 零号机尸体推到一边，让初号机站了起来，始终留意着右臂上那道骇人的伤口。当他转身想看看是谁救了他时，突然听到通讯器里传来一个含糊不清的声音。

"What the hell do you think you're doing idiot!"  
“你到底在搞什么鬼，白痴！”

Though Shinji only caught about half of what was spoken, he instantly knew who it was. Spinning around fully now, he saw that Unit 02 was standing there with its battered body and its arm outstretched towards him.  
虽然真嗣只听清了大概一半的内容，但他立刻就知道了声音的主人是谁。完全转过身来，他看到二号机就站在那里，伤痕累累的身体，手臂向他伸展开来。

"Asu...ka..." Shinji mumbled quietly inside the entry plug of Unit 01.  
"Asu...ka..." 真嗣在初号机的插入栓内小声咕哝着。

Asuka let an indignant 'humph' escape her lips, but she was still smiling ever so slightly.  
明日香不满地哼了一声，但嘴角仍微微上扬着。

"I think a word of thanks would be appreciated, since I did just save your butt-"  
"我觉得一声感谢会让人感到欣慰，毕竟我刚刚才救了你的屁股——"

"You fool! Get out of here now! This is no place for somebody who doesn't even have a functioning Evangelion and hasn't even piloted one in almost a month."  
"你这个蠢货！现在就滚出去！这里不是给那些连能用的 EVA 都没有，而且近一个月都没驾驶过 EVA 的人待的地方。"

"Big deal," scoffed Asuka as she made Unit 02 slowly walk forward towards Unit 01.  
""有什么了不起的，"" 明日香嗤之以鼻，让零二号机缓缓走向零一号机。

"Why are you being so stupid!"  
"你为什么这么愚蠢！"

"Me? I'm being stupid! Look at yourself moron. Who's the one thats taken everything upon themselves without asking for help?"  
"我？我才是那个蠢货！看看你自己，笨蛋。谁是那个把所有事情都揽在自己身上却不寻求帮助的人？"

"I don't need help, and certainly not from yo-"  
"我不需要帮助，尤其不需要来自你——"

"Did you ever think about what everyone else would think if you died! What about Misato? What about me!"  
"你有没有想过如果你死了，其他人会怎么想！美里怎么办？我怎么办！"

"Stop it..." "别这样..."

"No I won't, Shinji. I don't care what you say or do, nor will I listen to you. I'm staying here because of my own will, because I want to. I want to stay here and help you!"  
"不，我不会的，真嗣。我不在乎你说什么或做什么，也不会听你的。我留在这里是因为我自己的意愿，因为我想要留下来。我想留在这里帮助你！"

"Stop it Asuka, you're-" "别这样，明日香，你——"

"I spoke with my mother," Asuka blurted out, cutting off Shinji instantly. "She told me that you two talked."  
"我和我妈妈谈过了，" 明日香脱口而出，立刻打断了真嗣。"她告诉我你们俩谈过了。"

Shinji was silent as he heard her words, but his hands tensed up slightly.  
听到她的话，真嗣沉默不语，但他的手微微紧绷。

"What did she tell you?"  
"她跟你说了什么？"

"Does it matter?" "有关系吗？"

"...I don't know," said Shinji slowly. "How do you feel about it?"  
"...我不知道，" 真嗣缓缓地说。"你对这件事怎么看？"

Asuka hesitated for a second before she said, "I-I don't know. I lot of it I don't understand, still don't understand even after talking with her. But you...and me...something, I don't know-"  
明日香犹豫了一会儿才说，"我-我不知道。很多事情我还是不明白，即使和她谈过之后。但你...和我...有些事情，我不知道-"

"You're just imagining it," said Shinji.  
"你只是想象出来的，" 真嗣说。

"Am I?" asked Asuka. "I don't think so, and I don't think you believe what you yourself are saying anymore than I do."  
"是吗？" 明日香问。"我不这么认为，而且我觉得你自己也不再相信自己说的话，就像我不相信一样。

"This isn't the place for you."  
"这里不适合你。"

"And it is for you?"  
"这是给你的吗？"

"I am different than you."  
"我和你不一样。"

"No you're not!" shouted Asuka, catching Shinji off guard. "How can you not realize it! You and I are the same. I don't care about all the shit about you being part angel or whatever. Its the other stuff that I care about."  
"不，你不是！" 明日香大喊道，让真嗣措手不及。"你怎么能意识不到！你和我是一样的。我才不在乎你是什么半天使之类的鬼话。我在乎的是其他的事情。"

"Don't you understand though!" retorted Shinji just as angrily. "Just by being near me you could die at any minute."  
"你难道还不明白吗！" 真嗣同样愤怒地反驳道。"仅仅是因为靠近我，你随时都可能死去。"

"Do you think I don't know that? Do you really think I would even be here without having considered all of that. I know thats its dangerous for me to be here, and I know that I could die if I'm close to you. But I'm past all that, because I couldn't live with myself if I had abandoned you. Just now, if not for me, you would have died. What then? What would have happened to Nerv with that thing still alive?"  
"你以为我不知道这些吗？你真的认为我会不考虑这一切就来到这里吗？我知道待在这里对我来说很危险，我知道如果靠近你我可能会死。但我已经超越了这些顾虑，因为我无法忍受自己抛弃你的那种生活。就在刚才，如果不是我，你已经死了。那会怎样？如果那东西还活着，NERV 会变成什么样？"

"Thats-" started Shinji. "那是——" 真嗣开口道。

"I'm not budging! Not for you, not for Misato, not for my mother. I'm staying by your side whether you want me to or not."  
"我不会让步的！无论是对你，对美里，还是对我母亲。不管你愿不愿意，我都会留在你身边。"

"...Asuka..." "...明日香..."

"Something happened between us, what I don't know, though I can certainly guess. I'm different than how I used to be, whether thats because of you, or something else, I don't know. What I do know is that I'm glad that I was able to meet you, even in this day and age, I'm glad that we could be friends."  
"我们之间发生了一些事，虽然我不清楚具体是什么，但我能猜到。我和以前不一样了，无论是你的原因，还是其他什么，我不知道。我只知道，我很高兴能在这样的时代遇见你，我很高兴我们能成为朋友。"

Unit 02 stopped a few feet away from Unit 01 waiting for any sign of movement from the Evangelion Unit. Everything Asuka had told him was floating around in Shinji's mind, and he didn't like it. He never would have thought that she would manage to enter the Evangelion chamber and secure her Eva Unit. Misato must have had something to do with that. But here she was, stubborn as always and refusing to leave him. He hated it, hated the fact that he was tied down because of such a reason. He couldn't refuse her, but he couldn't agree with her either.  
02 号机在距离 01 号机几英尺的地方停下，等待着福音战士的任何动静。明日香告诉他的所有事情都在真嗣的脑海中盘旋，他对此感到不快。他从未想过她能设法进入福音战士的驾驶舱并控制她的 EVA。这背后肯定有美里的一份功劳。但她就在这里，一如既往地固执，拒绝离开他。他讨厌这样，讨厌因为这样的原因被束缚。他无法拒绝她，但也无法赞同她。

"Do what you want then, just don't get in my way," he finally said.  
“那就随你便吧，只要别妨碍我就行，”他最终说道。

"I was planning to anyway," said Asuka as Unit 02 walked past Unit 01, solidifying the fact that they were in this together. Though as Unit 02 continued walking forward Asuka turned and asked Shinji-  
“我本来就是这么打算的，”明日香说着，02 号机从 01 号机旁走过，确认了他们将共同面对这一切。尽管 02 号机继续前行，明日香转头问真嗣——

"What am I to you?"  
"我对你来说是什么？"

Shinji immediately knew the answer, because it had been on his mind for a long time now.  
真嗣立刻知道答案，因为这问题在他心中已萦绕许久。

"A distant memory," was his reply.  
"一段遥远的记忆，" 他回答道。

"I see," mumbled Asuka as she turned away from Unit 01 and Shinji, not wanting him to see the slight smile which parted her lips.  
"我明白了，" 明日香咕哝着，转身离开初号机和真嗣，不想让他看到自己唇边微微的笑意。

Deep beneath the foundations of Nerv, at the very core of Terminal Dogma where the being Lilith resided, a man and a young girl stood looking up at this giant life like figure.  
在 NERV 地基之下，终端教条区的核心，莉莉丝所在之处，一个男人和一个年轻女孩站在那里，仰望着这个巨大的生命体。

"It is time, Rei," said Gendo Ikari as he looked up into the face of Lilith.  
"是时候了，绫波，" 碇源堂说道，他抬头凝视着莉莉丝的面容。

Rei simply nodded her head in acknowledgement, but above all of them the being known as Lilith watched in silent patience as everything continued to unfold.  
丽只是点头表示知晓，但在他们所有人之上，被称为莉莉丝的存在正默默地耐心观察着一切的展开。

Simultaneously, far above Terminal Dogma, in the ruins of Tokyo-3, the Mass Produced Eva Units slowly started regenerating...  
与此同时，在终端教义区遥远的上方，第三新东京市的废墟中，量产型 EVA 单位开始缓慢地再生……

### Chapter 31: Happenings 

**Alright...sorry about the wait on this everyone. I had so much stuff going on in November that I hardly had time to think. But schools over now (and a bunch of other side projects) so now I'm free to work on Spawn of Adam...and my other story. Yeah, I'm doing a Christmas special again. More info on that at bottom of page. I'm gonna try to get a chapter of this out a week before school starts again...so hopefully that will come true. (I can only pray) Have fun reading this!  
好吧……很抱歉让大家久等了。十一月我忙得不可开交，几乎没时间思考。但现在学校放假了（还有一堆其他项目也结束了），我可以自由地投入到《亚当的后裔》……以及我的另一部作品中了。没错，我又在筹备圣诞特别篇了。更多信息请见页面底部。我会尽量在开学前每周更新一章……希望这能实现。（我只能祈祷）祝阅读愉快！**

Within an hour of the initial attack by the countries backed by Seele, Tokyo-3 had turned into a ghost town. The entire city was coated in dust and debris from the destruction and the rampaging Eva Units. Buildings lay knocked on their sides with thousands of papers flying through the air and glass covering every inch of ground. The city looked like something right out of the apocalypse. But two people still stood up in this wasteland and waited for the new dawn to break.  
在 Seele 支持的国家发起的首次攻击后不到一小时，东京-3 已变成了一座鬼城。整个城市被尘埃和破坏产生的碎片覆盖，狂暴的 Eva 机体横行无忌。建筑物被撞得东倒西歪，成千上万的纸张在空中飞舞，玻璃碎片铺满了每一寸地面。这座城市宛如末日降临的景象。但在这片废墟中，仍有两人屹立不倒，等待着新黎明的到来。

After Asuka passed by Shinji in Unit 02, he thought long and hard about what to do next. He had never dreamed that Asuka would have followed him this far, and he had to admire her slightly for that amount of determination she had shown him. Certainly she had never been more sure of something in her entire life before this. But Shinji still didn't like that she was here, because he was starting to get bad vibes.  
在明日香驾驶着二号机从真嗣身边经过后，他长时间地深思熟虑接下来该做什么。他从未想过明日香会一路跟随他到此，为此他不得不对她展现出的那份决心表示些许敬佩。当然，她在此之前从未如此确信过某件事。但真嗣仍然不喜欢她在这里，因为他开始感到一些不祥的预感。

The Eva Units had been destroyed, that much he was sure of, but something else still didn't feel right, and for a while he thought about Lilith. She was somewhere out there, moving events so that it fell in line with her plans, and he didn't like it. No doubt she knew about him and Asuka, and would no doubt use that to her advantage if she had to.  
EVA 机体已被摧毁，这一点他确信无疑，但总有些事情感觉不对劲，他一度想到了莉莉丝。她就在某个地方，推动事件按照她的计划发展，这让他感到不安。毫无疑问，她知道他和明日香的事，如果需要，她肯定会利用这一点来为自己谋利。

He also thought about Gendo and Rei, wondering what they were doing, and even Misato. He thought about asking Asuka about it, but was unsure if she would even tell him, and whether he would like the answer. So he preferred to keep his mouth shut, but what did he have left to do? He could hardly travel to every nation looking for Seele, even though it was likely a few of there members may very well be right here in Japan, overseeing their attack against Nerv. He could continue fighting the nations, but what relevance did that really have? No, there was something else he had to do, but he just couldn't figure it out.  
他还想到了源堂和绫波，想知道他们在做什么，甚至还有美里。他想问问明日香，但又拿不准她是否会告诉他，以及他是否愿意听到答案。所以他宁愿保持沉默，但他还能做什么呢？他总不能走遍每个国家去寻找 Seele，尽管那里的一些成员很可能就在日本，监督着对 NERV 的攻击。他可以继续与各国战斗，但这真的有意义吗？不，他还有别的事情要做，只是他一时想不出来。

"Oi...Shinji? Shinji? ...Idiot! Wake up!"  
“喂...真嗣？真嗣？...笨蛋！醒醒！”

"What!" snapped Shinji instantly as Asuka pulled him out of his own thoughts.  
“什么！”真嗣立刻回过神来，明日香将他从自己的思绪中拉了出来。

"Jeez, you don't have to be rude," retorted Asuka.  
"天哪，你没必要这么粗鲁，" 明日香反驳道。

"And don't you go jabbing me in the side with your Eva Unit!"  
"还有，别用你的 Eva 机体戳我！"

Asuka had been poking Unit 01 in its side where the rib cage was with the remaining arm of Unit 02. Of course, because of Shinji's strong connection with Unit 01, he was able to feel every bump, and it was thoroughly annoying him.  
明日香一直在用二号机的剩余手臂戳零号机侧面的肋骨位置。当然，由于真嗣与零号机有着强烈的联系，他能感受到每一次触碰，这让他非常恼火。

"Why are you so pissed?"  
"你为什么这么生气？"

"Haven't I told you! Whatever happens to Unit 01 happens to me, so I just felt your Unit 02 poking me, and it felt like a bee sting."  
"我不是告诉过你吗！零号机发生的一切也会发生在我身上，所以我刚刚感觉到你的二号机在戳我，感觉就像被蜜蜂蜇了一下。"

"Well sorry," grumbled Asuka as she turned away from him, and then she noticed the large hole in Unit 01's upper arm. "What about that? I thought that you were able to regenerate, so why isn't that healing?"  
"好吧，抱歉，"" 明日香咕哝着转过身去，然后她注意到了零号机上臂的大洞。""那又是怎么回事？我以为你能再生，为什么那个伤口没有愈合？"

"Forget about that," said Shinji as he ignored the pain that coursed through his arm at his own words. "What did you want?"  
"别提那个了，" 真嗣说道，他无视了自己话语中手臂传来的疼痛。"你想要什么？"

"What are we supposed to be doing?"  
"我们该做什么？"

"If I knew, do you think I'd be just standing here?" Shinji snapped back at her.  
"如果我知道，你以为我会站在这里什么都不做吗？" 真嗣不耐烦地回敬她。"

Asuka then mumbled something about Shinji having a stick up his ass before she said, "The Eva Units are already destroyed, so what is there left? We can hardly attack Seele."  
明日香随后咕哝着说真嗣屁股上插了根棍子，然后她说：“Eva 机体已经被毁了，还有什么剩下的？我们根本没法攻击 Seele。”

"I know that already," said Shinji annoyed. "But...I don't know...something doesn't feel right."  
“我早就知道了，”真嗣不耐烦地说，“但是……我不知道……就是感觉哪里不对劲。”

Asuka watched him for a moment before she said, "Maybe you're just imagining things," scoffed Asuka lightly.  
明日香看了他一会儿，然后说：“也许你只是想多了，”明日香轻蔑地笑了笑。

Shinji grimaced at her remark but didn't say anything. Maybe she was right...  
真嗣对她的话皱了皱眉，但没有说什么。也许她是对的……

No, something else was wrong, but-  
不，有别的问题，但是——

Shinji whipped around suddenly as he felt a surge of energy rushing towards them. Turning back around he shouted, "Asuka get out of here, something is-"  
真嗣突然感觉到一股能量向他们袭来，猛地转过身去，回头大喊：“明日香，快离开这里，有什么东西——”

Out from the dust and smoke emerged the first Eva Unit that Shinji had defeated. The jaw which had been completely shattered was repaired as though nothing had happened.  
从尘埃和烟雾中，第一个被真嗣击败的 Eva 机体出现了。那曾经完全粉碎的下颚，如今修复如初，仿佛什么都没发生过。

With a Lance of Longinus in hand, the Eva Unit rushed at Unit 01, thrusting outward. Ignoring the shouts from Asuka, Shinji made Unit 01 step in front of the Eva Unit, blocking it from attacking Unit 02. Ducking under the attack so that it soared above Unit 01, Shinji struck outward with the fists of Unit 01, catching the Eva Unit in the chest. As the Eva Unit went reeling backwards, Shinji grabbed the Lance of Longinus, and wrenched it out of its grip.  
手持朗基努斯之枪的 Eva 机体疾冲向 01 号机，猛力刺出。无视明日香的呼喊，真嗣操控 01 号机挡在 Eva 机体前，阻止其攻击 02 号机。真嗣低头避开攻击，让攻击从 01 号机上方掠过，随即用 01 号机的拳头击中 Eva 机体的胸膛。Eva 机体踉跄后退时，真嗣抓住朗基努斯之枪，将其从 Eva 机体的掌握中夺走。

"Hold onto this," Shinji shouted at Asuka as he spun around and threw her the pseudo Lance of Longinus. Asuka mumbled something after he shouted at her, but he wasn't paying attention.  
“拿着这个，”真嗣向明日香喊道，同时转身将伪朗基努斯之枪抛给她。明日香在他喊话后嘟囔了些什么，但他并未留意。

Turning back around, he saw that not only the first Eva Unit, but several of the others had arrived to continue the battle. It was as though he had never fought them in the first place.  
转过身来，他发现不仅第一台 EVA 机体，还有其他几台也已抵达，继续这场战斗。仿佛他从未与它们交战过一样。

"What the fuck!" shouted Asuka. "I thought you defeated them!"  
“搞什么鬼！”明日香大喊，“我以为你已经打败它们了！”

Shinji was silent as he continued staring at there resurrected bodies. He should have seen this coming though. They had the DNA of Kaoru in them, were able to create AT-fields, and now apparently were able to regenerate damaged tissue.  
真嗣沉默地继续凝视着它们复活的躯体。他本该预料到这一点的。它们体内有薰的 DNA，能够生成 AT 力场，现在看来还能再生受损组织。

"I did," yelled Shinji back at her, finally answering her question. "But they are able to regenerate like myself!"  
"我说了，" 真嗣朝她吼回去，终于回答了她的提问。"但他们能像我一样再生！"

"Then how the fuck are we supposed to defeat them!"  
"那他妈的我们该怎么打败他们！"

'How about you charge at them and act as a decoy,' thought Shinji bitterly, before he turned to the Eva Units slowly gathering around them. If he didn't do something soon, they would be surrounded.  
'不如你去冲向他们，充当诱饵吧，' 真嗣苦涩地想，随后转向缓缓聚集在他们周围的 EVA 机体。如果他再不采取行动，他们就会被包围。

Looking around desperately as though looking for a way out, he suddenly spotted the last Eva Unit that had been defeated, the one that Asuka had sliced in half with Unit 02's AT-field. The sinews and nerves were starting to rejoin the two halves of the bodies and were slowly forming new tendons to connect the muscles.  
他绝望地环顾四周，仿佛在寻找出路，突然间瞥见了最后一台被击败的 Eva 机体，那是被明日香用 02 号机 AT 力场劈成两半的那台。神经和肌腱开始重新连接两半的身体，并缓慢地形成新的肌腱来连接肌肉。

'If I could destroy that one a little more, it would make the regeneration slower, but it would still regenerate eventually...'  
“如果我能再破坏那台一点，它的再生会变慢，但最终还是会再生……”

As he finished his thoughts, two Eva Units which had been hiding behind the curtain of dust suddenly charged out in front of him. Cursing slightly, he brought Unit 01's right hand down and generated Unit 01's AT-field, cutting the legs of both Eva Units off in one fluid motion. But it was only a temporary fix to the problem.  
他刚想完这些，两台隐藏在尘埃幕后的 Eva 机体突然冲到他面前。他轻声咒骂，随即用 01 号机的右手生成 AT 力场，一气呵成地将两台 Eva 机体的腿切断。但这只是暂时解决问题的方法。

"Shinji, to your left!" came Asuka's screech from somewhere behind him.  
“真嗣，向左！”明日香从他身后某处尖叫道。

Not even hesitating to think about her command, Shinji made Unit 01 swing around to its left just in time as the AT-field of the Eva Unit erupted in front of him. Quickly projecting Unit 01's AT-field, the two clashed against each other, sparks ricocheting off each other and falling to the ground. Just as Shinji was thinking about generating his own AT-field, a prog knife came flying from Unit 02's direction and stabbed into the back of the Eva Unit, paralyzing it momentarily. Taking this chance, Shinji forcefully ripped open the Eva's AT-field with Unit 01's, and struck the Eva Unit in the side of its head with Unit 01's fist. The side of the head caved in on itself, creating a large indent. As the Eva Unit toppled backwards, Shinji whipped his head around briefly to see Asuka in Unit 02 giving him an okay sign. He was almost certain that she was smirking inside her entry plug and hated himself for being saved by her again.  
真嗣毫不犹豫地执行她的命令，使初号机及时向左转身，就在他面前，EVA 的 AT 力场爆发了。他迅速展开初号机的 AT 力场，两者相撞，火花四溅，落在地上。正当真嗣考虑生成自己的 AT 力场时，一把 prog 刀从二号机的方向飞来，刺入了 EVA 的后背，使其暂时瘫痪。抓住这个机会，真嗣用初号机的 AT 力场强行撕开了 EVA 的力场，并用初号机的拳头击中了 EVA 头部的侧面。头部凹陷，形成了一个大坑。EVA 向后倒下时，真嗣短暂地回头看了一眼，只见二号机中的明日香向他比了个 OK 的手势。他几乎可以肯定她在插入栓里在得意地笑，而他再次被她救了，这让他感到苦涩。

'Damn it,' he thought bitterly.  
“该死，”他苦涩地想。

Wrenching the prog knife out of the Eva Unit's back, he stared down at it for a second before he brought the heel of Unit 01 down on its skull, instantly shattering it and created something that looked like cherry jello.  
他从 Eva 机体的背部猛地拔出那把程序刀，盯着它片刻后，用 01 号机体的脚跟重重踩在它的头骨上，瞬间将其粉碎，形成了一团酷似樱桃果冻的东西。

'That should buy us some time.' Shinji cringed slightly at his own words, as us referred to both him and Asuka.  
'这样应该能为我们争取一些时间。' 真嗣对自己说的话略感不适，因为“我们”指的是他和明日香。

Turning back to the other Eva Units, he stared them down for a few seconds before he mumbled slightly to Asuka.  
他转回身面对其他 Eva 机体，凝视了它们几秒钟，然后略带含糊地对明日香低语。

"I'm going to do something, and I want you to stay directly behind me."  
"我要做一件事，你得直接站在我后面。"

"Why?" asked Asuka with her eyebrows slightly raised.  
"为什么？" 明日香微微挑眉问道。

"Do you need a reason every time I tell you to do something!"  
"难道我每次让你做什么事都需要理由吗！"

"Ass," grumbled Asuka inside Unit 02's entry plug. But she was smiling slightly.  
"该死，"明日香在二号机的插入栓内咕哝着，但嘴角微微上扬。

"Right then," mumbled Shinji.  
"那么，"真嗣喃喃自语。

Taking a few steps forward in Unit 01, he suddenly broke the sound barrier as Unit 01 rushed forward. It was so fast that Asuka blinked, and then Unit 01 was suddenly in front of the Eva Units.  
初号机向前迈了几步，突然间打破了音障，以惊人的速度冲向前方。快到让明日香眨了眨眼，初号机就已经出现在其他 EVA 机体面前。

"Idiot, tell me what you're gonna before you do it! How the hell am I supposed to keep up with your stupid speed!"  
"白痴，做之前告诉我你要干嘛！我怎么可能跟得上你那愚蠢的速度！"

"Figure it out!" laughed Shinji slightly as he drove Unit 01's fist into the jaw of the nearest Eva Unit, generating the AT-field of Unit 01 simultaneously so that the entire top part of the Eva's head popped off like a cork.  
""自己猜去吧！"" 真嗣轻笑着，同时操控初号机一拳击中最近的一台 EVA 的下巴，并瞬间展开初号机的 AT 力场，使得那台 EVA 的整个头部像瓶塞一样被弹飞。

"Jeez," grumbled Asuka as she ran forward with Unit 02 also. Suddenly from her left an Eva Unit emerged out of the dust that Unit 01 had kicked up when it had rushed forward. Dodging the thrust of another Lance of Longinus without too much difficulty, Asuka twirled the lance that Unit 02 had grasped in its own hand and stabbed it into the chest of the Eva Unit. Next second, she made her Unit 02 generate its AT-field, forcing the lance in further and out the other side, creating a gaping hole in the Eva's chest cavity.  
""真是的，"" 明日香咕哝着，与二号机一同向前冲去。突然，从左侧尘土飞扬中，一台 EVA 从初号机之前疾冲时扬起的尘土中现身。明日香轻松躲过另一支朗基努斯之枪的突刺，随即操控二号机旋转手中紧握的长枪，猛地刺入那台 EVA 的胸膛。紧接着，她令二号机生成 AT 力场，将长枪进一步推入并穿透对方身体，在 EVA 的胸腔内留下一个巨大的窟窿。

"See, I can take care of myself," said Asuka haughtily as Unit 02 straightened up. Though as she looked to her right, she saw that Shinji was fighting three Eva Units at once.  
"看，我能照顾好自己，" 明日香傲慢地说道，02 号机挺直了身躯。然而，当她向右看去时，她发现真嗣正在同时与三台 EVA 单位战斗。

'Show off,' she thought slightly as she picked the Lance of Longinus off the ground and rushed forward to help him.  
'显摆，' 她心里略带不满地想着，同时从地上捡起朗基努斯之枪，冲上前去帮助他。

Feeling Asuka nearing him, Shinji quickly shouted, "Don't come any closer!"  
感觉到明日香接近，真嗣迅速喊道："别再靠近了！"

And he was right to stop her.  
他的阻止是正确的。

The three Eva Units all at once discharged their AT-fields directly at Unit 01. The ground was ripped asunder as Shinji generated both his and Unit 01's AT-field, clashing against the other three. Asuka stopped in her tracks as she saw this, amazed that just a thing could actually happen. As she watched though, she started to become worried about Shinji; it was apparent that he was having difficulty holding off the three Eva Units. Though even as she took a hesitant step forward to help he shouted at her-  
三台 EVA 机体同时向 01 号机释放了 AT 力场。地面被撕裂，真嗣同时生成了自己和 01 号机的 AT 力场，与另外三台 EVA 对抗。明日香停下脚步，惊讶于这种事情竟然真的发生了。然而，她看着看着，开始为真嗣担心起来；显然，他正艰难地抵挡着三台 EVA 的攻击。尽管她犹豫着向前迈了一步想要帮忙，他却对她大喊——

"DONT FUCKING MOVE!" “别他妈动！”

Just as Shinji shouted this, he twisted Unit 01 around with a quick side step and broke through one of the Eva Unit's AT-fields, sinking Unit 01's fist into the Eva Unit's stomach. As it reeled backwards, Unit 01 ducked down quickly and swung its leg around, catching the other two Eva Units so that they fell down. With the AT-fields down, Shinji made Unit 01 bring back its fist and drive it into the head of one of the downed Eva Units. The skull crushed, splattering the ground with bone, gore, and brain matter.  
就在真嗣大喊的同时，他迅速侧步扭转初号机，突破了一台 EVA 的 AT 力场，将初号机的拳头深深插入那台 EVA 的腹部。对方踉跄后退之际，初号机迅速蹲下并甩腿横扫，将另外两台 EVA 一并绊倒。随着 AT 力场被破，真嗣指挥初号机收回拳头，猛击其中一台倒地 EVA 的头部。头骨碎裂，骨头、血肉和脑浆四溅。

Turning to the other downed Eva Unit, Shinji suddenly felt a sharp pain in his leg as the Eva Unit had grabbed ahold of Unit 01's left leg, and bitten into it. A large chunk of Shinji's own leg was ripped apart, leaving the bone sticking out a a strange angle. Screaming venomously, Shinji grabbed the head of the Eva Unit and yanked its head upwards, before punching a hole straight through its chest. Throwing away the body, Shinji winced slightly at the gaping hole in his leg before he turned towards the other Eva Unit just in time, as he was forced to dodge as a Lance of Longinus was lunged towards him.  
转向另一台倒地的 EVA，真嗣突然感到腿部一阵剧痛，原来那台 EVA 抓住了初号机的左腿并狠狠咬了下去。真嗣自己的腿被撕下一大块肉，骨头以一种怪异的角度突出。他痛苦地尖叫着，抓住那台 EVA 的头猛地向上拽，然后一拳直穿其胸膛。扔掉尸体后，真嗣因腿上的巨大伤口微微皱眉，随即转身面对另一台 EVA，恰好躲过了一支朝他刺来的朗基努斯之枪。

'If I get hit by that again, I don't know if I'll be able to continue,' thought Shinji.  
“如果再被那东西击中一次，我不知道自己还能不能坚持下去。” 真嗣心想。

As the Eva Unit thrust the lance again towards him, Unit 01 grabbed it with both arms, making pain sear through Shinji's shoulder. Attempting to twist it out of the Eva Units grasp, Shinji was about to pull it out of its grasp, when its AT-field suddenly erupted in front of him. Catching Shinji by surprise, he was forced to let go of the Lance of Longinus and dive backwards as the AT-field rushed after him. Skidding against the broken up ground, Shinji suddenly generated Unit 01's AT-field and crashed it against the Eva Units. Sparks flew and fell to the ground as the two raw energies crashed against each other. Dust flew into the air while large chunks of earth were thrown into the air before being turned to dust by the ensuing energy.  
当 Eva 机体再次将长枪刺向他时，01 号机用双臂抓住了它，剧痛穿透了真嗣的肩膀。他试图扭动长枪，从 Eva 机体的掌握中夺走它，就在这时，对方的 AT 力场突然在他面前爆发。真嗣猝不及防，被迫松开朗基努斯之枪，向后翻滚，而 AT 力场紧追不舍。他在破碎的地面上滑行，突然间，01 号机生成了自己的 AT 力场，猛烈撞击 Eva 机体。两股原始能量相撞，火花四溅，尘埃飞扬，大地碎块被抛向空中，随后被随之而来的能量化为尘埃。

'Damn it, its just one more...but-' Not only was Shinji's wounded shoulder paining him, but his leg seemed to be taking longer to heal. It was possible that a splinter from the Lance of Longinus that had pierced him had a fragmented piece still lodged in the shoulder of Unit 01.  
“该死，就差一个了……但是——” 不仅真嗣受伤的肩膀疼痛难忍，他的腿似乎愈合得更慢了。可能是朗基努斯之枪刺穿他时，有一块碎片仍卡在 01 号机的肩膀里。

As Shinji was about to break the AT-field of the Eva Unit though, he felt another presence nearing him, and next second, instantly knew who it was.  
正当真嗣即将打破 EVA 初号机的 AT 力场时，他感觉到另一个存在正接近自己，下一秒，他立刻知道那是谁。

"Don't-" “别——”

But he was cut off as the Lance of Longinus that he had thrown Asuka earlier pierced straight through the neck of the Eva Unit, creating a fountain of blood that spewed outward and covered Unit 01. The Eva Unit dropped almost instantly, its AT-field dissipating and the lance it had had in its hand dropping from its grasp. As it fell to the ground, Shinji saw Unit 02 standing directly behind it with the lance still extended. The two looked at each other for a few seconds amidst the body of Eva Units before Asuka said-  
但他话音未落，之前他投向明日香的朗基努斯之枪已径直贯穿了 EVA 初号机的颈部，喷涌而出的鲜血如泉涌般向外喷洒，覆盖了初号机。EVA 初号机几乎立刻倒下，其 AT 力场消散，手中的长枪也从手中滑落。当它倒在地上时，真嗣看到 EVA 二号机正站在它身后，长枪依然伸出。两人在 EVA 初号机的残骸中对视了几秒钟，随后明日香说道——

"What, don't I deserve a thank you?" asked Asuka.  
"怎么，我不配得到一句谢谢吗？" 明日香问道。

Shinji snorted slightly and turned away from her, ignoring the glare that he knew she was giving him.  
真嗣轻哼一声，转过身去，无视了他知道明日香正投向他的怒视。

"Fine, be that way," grumbled Asuka as she turned away from him and started walking away before pausing slightly and turning back around.  
"好吧，随你便，" 明日香咕哝着，转身走开，走了几步后稍稍停顿，又转了回来。

"Is your leg okay?" "你的腿还好吗？"

Shinji didn't bother turning around, but he did eventually say, "Its fine, it'll heal on its own."  
真嗣没有费心转身，但他最终还是说："没事，它会自己愈合的。"

"Then what about your shoulder?" asked Asuka with her eyebrows slightly raised.  
"那你的肩膀呢？" 明日香微微挑起眉毛问道。

Shinji finally turned around and stared at her for a few moments before he said, "Thats a little...different. I was pierced by a Lance of Longinus earlier...even I can't regenerate from a wound from that supposed holy relic."  
真嗣终于转过身来，盯着她看了好一会儿才说道：“这有点……不同。我之前被朗基努斯之枪刺中过……即便是我，也无法从那种所谓的圣遗物造成的伤口中再生。”

"I see," mumbled Asuka as she looked down.  
“我明白了，”明日香低声咕哝着，目光垂下。

Shinji continued looking at her for a few seconds before he sighed and said, "Don't worry about me and get out of here. These things are likely going to continue regenerating, so I'll just have to keep killing them."  
真嗣继续注视了她几秒钟，然后叹了口气说：“别担心我，快离开这里。这些东西很可能会继续再生，所以我只能不停地消灭它们。”

"Haven't I already told you that I'm staying with you," she said.  
"我不是已经告诉过你我会和你在一起吗？" 她问道。

"I think you've made yourself pretty clear about that," replied Shinji, "but it doesn't mean that I have to agree with you."  
"关于这一点，你已经表达得很清楚了，" 真嗣回答，"但这并不意味着我必须同意你。"

"I've saved your ass several times now, so at most you should be grateful."  
"我已经救了你几次了，所以你最多应该感激我。"

"Like that'll ever happen," laughed Shinji as he turned away from her, and starting walking towards a nearby Eva Unit which he assumed would be regenerating soon. Though with him walked Asuka.  
"“像那种事怎么可能发生，”真嗣笑着转身离开她，开始向附近一台他推测即将再生的 EVA 走去。虽然与他同行的还有明日香。”

"What are these things exactly?" she asked after they looked down at the mangled body of the Eva Unit for a moment.  
"“这些东西到底是什么？”她在他們低头看了一会儿那台被毁坏的 EVA 后问道。”

Shinji paused for a moment before he decided it wouldn't hurt to tell her though he decided to start off snide.  
"真嗣停顿了一下，然后觉得告诉她也没什么坏处，尽管他决定先以一种嘲讽的口吻开始。”

"What? Misato never told you?"  
"什么？美里从来没告诉过你？"

"Well...she did I think..."  
"嗯...我想她是说过的..."

"Idiot," mumbled Shinji. "笨蛋，" 真嗣咕哝道。

Asuka then took a swipe at Unit 01 with Unit 02 but missed horribly.  
随后，明日香操控二号机向初号机猛扑过去，却狼狈地扑了个空。

"Are you going to tell me or what!"  
“你到底说不说！”

"If you stop annoying me I will," laughed Shinji, but quickly clammed up. 'Damn it,' he thought, 'I can't let myself get dragged into her pace...'  
"“你要是不再烦我，我就告诉你，”真嗣笑着说，但很快又闭上了嘴。‘该死，’他心想，‘我不能让自己被她的节奏牵着走...’”

"Fine..." Shinji paused here for a minute as though gathering his thoughts, though in actuality wishing he could get away from her.  
"好吧..." 真嗣在这里停顿了一分钟，仿佛在整理思绪，但实际上他希望自己能远离她。

"The Eva Units, or the Mass Produced Eva Units were created by Seele to replace the Prototype, Test Type, and the Combat Type."  
"Eva 机体，或者说量产型 Eva 机体，是由 Seele 创造的，用来取代原型机、测试型和战斗型。"

"So mine, yours, and the pets in other words," said Asuka.  
"也就是说，我的、你的，还有其他那些宠物，" 明日香说道。

"...Right," said Shinji testily, making it apparent he didn't want her interrupting her.  
"...好吧，" 真嗣不耐烦地说道，显然不希望她打断。

"The Eva Units were created from the DNA of Kaoru Nagisa, or Tabris, the final angel. They all have the S2 engines that allow them to run for an indefinite amount of time, are able to regenerate, and can generate an AT-field rivaling that of the Combat Type. They don't seem to have much intelligence but seem to grow angry with the death of their comrades. Other than that I really don't know much about them. I figured Misato would know more, but she never told me much about them."  
"Eva 机体是由渚薰，即最后的使徒塔布里斯，的 DNA 创造的。它们都拥有 S2 引擎，可以无限期运行，能够自我修复，并且能生成与战斗型相媲美的 AT 力场。它们似乎智力不高，但在同伴死亡时会变得愤怒。除此之外，我对它们了解不多。我以为美里会知道更多，但她从未告诉我太多关于它们的信息。"

Asuka was silent for a minute as she soaked all this in but she eventually asked, "I can't imagine that being all to them."  
明日香沉默了一会儿，消化着这些信息，但最终问道："我无法想象这就是它们的全部。"

"Nor can I admittedly," said Shinji. "I can't see Seele creating them just to replace the other Eva Units. Even the later Combat Types were cancelled to produce the Mass Produced Units."  
"我也无法否认这一点，" 真嗣说道。"我看不出 Seele 创造它们只是为了取代其他 EVA 单位。即使是后来的战斗型号也被取消，转而生产量产型单位。"

"Hey Shinji?" "嘿，真嗣？"

"...What?" "...什么？"

"What about the Lance of Longinus? I thought there was only one of them?"  
"那朗基努斯之枪呢？我记得应该只有一把吧？"

"So did I. The real one should still be floating in space."  
"我也这么认为。真正的应该还在太空中漂浮着。"

"What? When the hell did that happen?"  
"什么？这到底是什么时候发生的？"

Shinji was silent at Asuka's question, thinking about the many possible answers and coverups until he finally said, "Ayanami saved you with the lance when the twelfth angel attacked you."  
面对明日香的问题，真嗣沉默了，思考着多种可能的答案和掩饰，最终说道：“第十二使徒袭击你时，绫波用长枪救了你。”

"How do you know that?" asked quickly, almost accusingly at Shinji.  
"你怎么知道的？" 真嗣迅速问道，语气中几乎带着责备。

"I only heard about it," shrugged Shinji.  
"我只是听说的，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。

Asuka watched him for a moment before she said, "I remember something about that...but everything is still hazy..."  
明日香盯着他看了一会儿，然后说："我记得一些关于那件事的...但一切都还很模糊..."

Shinji didn't bother commenting on that and instead turned his attention back to the Eva Unit which had started regenerating. Quickly generating Unit 01's AT-field, he slashed into the reforming tissue of the Eva Unit, splattering the reformed muscles and tendons across the ground.  
真嗣懒得对此发表评论，而是将注意力转回到已经开始再生的 Eva 机体上。他迅速生成初号机的 AT 力场，挥刀斩入正在重组的组织，将新生的肌肉和肌腱碎片溅洒一地。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

"Now what?" he snapped back at her, getting irritated.  
“又怎么了？”他没好气地回道，感到一阵烦躁。

Asuka ignored the tone of his voice though and asked, "These...well, Lances of Longinus that the Eva Series have, they function like the original-"  
明日香没有理会他的语气，而是问道：“这些……嗯，EVA 系列拥有的朗基努斯之枪，它们的功能和原版一样吗？”

"Seems to be that way," Shinji grumbled as he briefly glanced at his mangled arm.  
“似乎是这样，”真嗣咕哝着，短暂地瞥了一眼自己被撕裂的手臂。

"-and they seem to be able to destroy AT-fields and they prevented yourself from regenerating. So shouldn't that also be the same for the Eva Series?"  
“——而且它们似乎能够摧毁 AT 力场，阻止你再生。那么，EVA 系列的情况不也应该一样吗？”

It took her words a few seconds to register with him, but when they did-  
她的话过了几秒才在他脑海中回响起来，但一旦反应过来——

"Are you saying that we should stab each of the Lances of Longinus into the Eva Units?"  
“你是说我们应该把朗基努斯之枪分别刺入 Eva 机体中？”

"Its worth a shot," said Asuka as she shrugged her shoulders. "And I can't think of anything that has a better chance of doing something. Its not like we can just keep killing them only to have them regenerate."  
“值得一试，”明日香耸了耸肩说道，“我想不出还有什么比这更有可能奏效的办法了。总不能一直杀它们，然后看着它们再生吧。”

Shinji hated to admit it, but she was right, and she did have a point. If they were anything like himself, then that should work. Though speaking of which, didn't Asuka already kill two Eva Units with the lance?  
真嗣讨厌承认这一点，但她是对的，她的确有道理。如果他们和他一样，那么这应该行得通。不过话说回来，明日香不是已经用长矛摧毁了两台 Eva 机体吗？

Looking over at the bodies of the crippled Eva Units, Shinji quickly picked out the ones that Asuka had stabbed. Walking over to them, he looked down at the corpses and saw what the lance had done. It was similar to what he had expected he supposed, since the same thing had virtually happened to him. The entire body of the Eva Unit was perfectly fine, except for the large hole in its chest where the lance had penetrated. The wound was still bleeding profusely, and though the Eva Unit moved ever so slightly, it was apparent that it wouldn't be attacking them anymore. Looking over at the other Eva Unit that Asuka had killed by piercing it through its neck, he saw virtually the same thing happening, though he figured the neck was more painful then the chest wound.  
真嗣扫视着那些残破的 Eva 机体，迅速辨认出被明日香刺中的那几台。他走近它们，低头看着这些尸体，看到了长矛造成的伤害。这和他预想的差不多，毕竟同样的事情几乎发生在他自己身上。Eva 机体的整个身体都完好无损，除了胸口被长矛穿透的大洞。伤口仍在大量出血，尽管 Eva 机体微微动了一下，但显然它不会再攻击他们了。真嗣转头看向明日香通过刺穿颈部杀死的那台 Eva 机体，他看到几乎同样的情况发生，尽管他猜想颈部受伤比胸口更痛苦。

"Give me the lance," said Shinji after he was done looking at the bodies.  
“把长矛给我，”真嗣看完尸体后说道。

"Why?" replied Asuka. "为什么？" 明日香反问道。

"...You were right," Shinji said as he started walking towards her. "The lance does affect them, or at least paralyze them would be more accurate."  
"...你说得对，" 真嗣边说边向她走去。"那长矛确实对他们有影响，或者更准确地说，是让他们瘫痪了。"

"...So what are you going to do?" asked Asuka as she passed the lance to Unit 01.  
"...那你打算怎么办？" 明日香问道，同时将长矛递给了初号机。

"Remove each of their heads with this thing," mumbled Shinji as he grasped the lance she had thrown him and pierced it directly into the skull of a nearby Eva Units head. Wrenching the lance upward, he ripped off the top part of its skull, splattering bone and brain matter across the ground. Asuka turned away though as he did this; she had seen enough death recently and was thoroughly sick of it.  
"用这东西砍下它们的头，" 真嗣咕哝着，握住她扔给他的长枪，直接刺入附近一具 EVA 机体的头颅。他用力将长枪向上扭动，撕开了头盖骨的上半部分，骨头和脑浆四溅在地。明日香在他这么做时转过身去；她最近见够了死亡，已经彻底厌倦了。

"You don't have to watch if you don't want to," said Shinji as he flicked the Lance of Longinus, removing some brain matter from the end of it. He had noticed her slight discomfort at what he had done.  
"如果你不想看，可以不用看，" 真嗣说着，甩了甩朗基努斯之枪，甩掉了枪尖上的脑浆。他注意到了她对他刚才行为的些许不适。

"I don't plan on it...but its just that, there's so much death here."  
"我并不打算看……只是，这里死亡太多了。"

"Didn't I tell you not to follow me," said Shinji as he turned away from her. Asuka bit back the remark she wanted to shout at him; she was still feeling sick about what she had seen.  
"我不是告诉过你不要跟着我吗？" 真嗣说着转身背对她。明日香忍住了想要对他大喊的冲动；她仍然对所见之事感到恶心。

"I'm not just talking about here though, Nerv, Dogma, Tokyo-3, why did all of this happen?"  
"我不仅仅是在说这里，NERV、DOGMA、第三新东京市，这一切为什么会发生？"

Still walking, Shinji said, "Not sure, Seele had likely planned to attack Tokyo-3 long before this, and after...Kaoru died, it was only a matter of time. Though I suppose that they wanted to kill me also, for what I am."  
真嗣继续走着，说道："不确定，Seele 可能早就计划攻击第三新东京市了，而在...薰死后，这只是时间问题。不过我想他们也想杀了我，因为我是什么。"

"Is that why you're fighting by yourself? Because you think this is all your fault?"  
"这就是你独自战斗的原因吗？因为你认为这都是你的错？"

"Maybe I do, maybe I don't," replied Shinji evasively, "doesn't really make a difference why they're here in the end does it?"  
"也许吧，也许不是，" 真嗣含糊其辞地回答，"最终他们在这里的原因真的重要吗？"

Asuka frowned at him for a second, wishing she could get a better understanding of him, but she had to admit that it didn't matter in the end. They attacked here for only one reason, and that was to kill everyone.  
绫波皱眉看着他，希望自己能更好地理解他，但她不得不承认，最终这并不重要。他们攻击这里只有一个原因，那就是要杀死所有人。

"No, I suppose it doesn't...but Misato...and Kaji...Ritsuko...everyone-"  
"不，我想不是...但美里...还有加持...律子...所有人——"

"It's no use dwelling on them. If they are alive, they are alive. If there not, then there not."  
"沉湎于过去毫无意义。如果他们还活着，那就活着。如果不在了，那就不在了。"

"Don't you care about them-"  
"你难道不关心他们吗——"

"Course I do, but what I'm doing right now is something that only I can do. I can recognize that. If I wasn't here...a lot more people would be dead right now," said Shinji remorsefully.  
“当然，但眼下我所做的事，只有我能做到。我明白这一点。如果我不在这里……会有更多人丧命。” 真嗣懊悔地说道。

Asuka stared at him for a few seconds, watching him peer over an Eva's body before plunging the lance into its head and then wrenching it out moments later.  
明日香盯着他看了几秒钟，看着他俯视着一架 EVA 的躯体，然后将长矛刺入其头部，片刻后又猛地拔出。

"Are Misato and Kaji alive?" she eventually asked in almost a whisper, but Shinji caught her words.  
“美里和加持还活着吗？”她最终几乎是用耳语问道，但真嗣听到了她的话。

For a moment, he didn't say anything, and continued the maiming of the Eva Units, but after killing another one, he paused and said-  
有那么一会儿，他什么也没说，继续破坏着 Eva 机体，但在又摧毁一台后，他停顿了一下，说道——

"I don't think so...at least, their AT-fields have disappeared."  
“我不这么认为……至少，它们的 AT 力场已经消失了。”

"You think so?" asked Asuka incredulously, amazed that he could evade such a question. "What do you mean you think so?"  
“你这么认为？”明日香难以置信地问道，惊讶于他竟能回避这样的问题。“你什么意思，你这么认为？”

"Just that," replied Shinji simply. "I haven't seen their bodies, nor have I gotten anything like a vision of them in a while, and even if I did, I wouldn't trust it right now. But I can't feel their AT-fields, which likely means that they have died..."  
"就那样，" 真嗣简单地回答，"我没见过他们的身体，也没有得到任何关于他们的预感，即使有，我现在也不会相信。但我感觉不到他们的 AT 力场，这很可能意味着他们已经死了..."

"But you said you think so," Asuka replied crossly.  
"但你说过你认为是这样，" 明日香不悦地回应。

Shinji finally plunged the lance into the last of the Eva Units and stood up with Unit 01 to its full height. The sun reflected off the purple metallic bindings that protected Unit 01, bathing the blood splattered ground in an almost blue hue.  
真嗣终于将长矛刺入最后一台 EVA 机体，与 01 号机一同站起身来。阳光反射在保护 01 号机的紫色金属绑带上，将血迹斑斑的地面映照成近乎蓝色的色调。

"I've finally stopped the Eva Units, but something else is bothering me..." mumbled Shinji.  
“我终于让 Eva 机体停了下来，但还有别的事情困扰着我……” 真嗣喃喃自语。

"We stopped them," Asuka reminded him, "though what does this have to do with Misato and Kaji?"  
“我们阻止了它们，” 明日香提醒他，“但这跟美里和加持有什么关系？”

Shinji was silent as he looked up into the sky, expecting to see a hawk or something. His mind was clouded over. The Eva Units were defeated, so what did Seele have left to throw at him? He almost expected something to strike him at any moment, but nothing did. Still looking around, he looked down towards where Terminal Dogma was, and wondered what Gendo, and more importantly Lilith was doing.  
真嗣沉默地抬头望向天空，期待能看到一只鹰或其他什么。他的思绪被阴云笼罩。Eva 机体已经被击败，Seele 还有什么手段能用来对付他？他几乎预感到随时会有什么东西袭击他，但什么也没有发生。他环顾四周，目光落向终端教条所在之处，心中疑惑着碇司令，更重要的是莉莉丝在做什么。

"Are you nervous Shinji?" asked Asuka after a few moments of silence between them.  
"你紧张吗，真嗣？" 在两人间片刻的沉默后，明日香问道。

"What?" asked Shinji, making it apparent that he had not heard her.  
"什么？" 真嗣问道，显然他刚才没听到她的话。

"Are you nervous?" she repeated, "you keep looking up at the sky and down at the ground."  
"你紧张吗？" 她重复道，"你一直在抬头看天，又低头看地。"

"No...not nervous, more like...anxious," he replied.  
"不...不是紧张，更像是...焦虑，" 他回答道。

Asuka frowned at him. He was normally so sure of himself, at least the times she had seen him, so this uncertain side to him was a little unnerving.  
明日香皱眉看着他。他通常对自己很有信心，至少在她见过的那些时候，所以这种不确定的一面让她有点不安。

"Whatever it is, I'm sure its all in your mind," said Asuka, making fun of him again.  
"不管是什么，我相信都是你多虑了，" 明日香再次取笑他道。

Shinji ignored her as though she wasn't even there, which Asuka didn't care for.  
真嗣对她视若无睹，仿佛她根本不存在，这让明日香很不爽。

"Hey! Did you hear me idiot!"  
“嘿！你这个白痴听到我说话了吗！”

"Can't you even give me two seconds of quiet?" asked Shinji rudely, as he turned towards her.  
“你就不能给我两秒钟的安静吗？”真嗣粗鲁地问道，同时转向她。

"What! So you can get all moody and glassy eyed?"  
"什么！所以你可以变得情绪化，眼神迷离？"

Shinji groaned audibly as she continued berating him.  
她继续责骂他，真嗣明显地发出了呻吟声。

He wasn't sure why he was anxious, though he unwilling though that nervous might be a better word. Whatever it was though, several thousand feet below him in Terminal Dogma, he wasn't liking the feel of it.  
他不确定自己为何感到焦虑，虽然他不愿意承认，但紧张这个词或许更贴切。无论如何，尽管他在几千英尺之上的终端教条，他并不喜欢这种感觉。

"What are you doing Lilith?"  
"莉莉丝，你在做什么？"

---

The eyes of Gendo Ikari traveled up the enormous body that was Lilith as he took in every detail, of its being, or was it her? He had never really determined this. What he was determined of though, was that he was about to be reunited with the person he had loved. Looking down at his disfigured right hand, he saw more dead tissue fall to the ground. If he didn't hurry, he'd likely be dead in an hour. Turning towards the person beside him, who was also looking up at the body that was Lilith, he looked at the figure known as Ayanami Rei.  
碇源堂的目光沿着莉莉丝庞大的身躯缓缓上移，他仔细观察着每一个细节，这是它的存在，还是她？他从未真正确定过。但他确定的是，他即将与自己所爱的人重逢。低头看着自己畸形残破的右手，他看到更多坏死的组织掉落在地。如果他不抓紧时间，很可能在一个小时内就会死去。转向身旁的人，那人也正仰望着莉莉丝的身躯，他看着被称为绫波零的少女。

"It is time, Rei," he mumbled.  
""是时候了，零。""他低声说道。

Ayanami Rei turned towards him ever so slightly, breaking her gaze away from Lilith, as though it pained her. Without voicing her displeasure, or opinion, she slow walked towards him and offered herself to him. Though as Gendo reached towards her, preparing for the joining of Adam and Lilith's DNA, a voice inside the chamber spoke out to him.  
绫波零微微转向他，从莉莉丝身上移开视线，仿佛这样做令她痛苦。她没有表达不满或意见，只是缓缓走向他，将自己献给他。然而，当碇源堂伸手准备进行亚当与莉莉丝 DNA 的结合时，一个声音在室内响起。

"So you're really going to go through with this Commander Ikari."  
“看来你真的要这么做，碇司令。”

Gendo spun around quickly, unholstering a gun in his jacket pocket as he went, expecting to see Ritsuko there, but met nothing but empty air.  
碇源堂迅速转身，从夹克口袋里掏出手枪，以为会看到赤木律子，却只遇到了空荡荡的空气。

"Up here!" came the voice again.  
“在这里！”声音再次传来。

Looking upwards, Gendo opened his mouth in surprise as he saw that a person was sitting on the shoulder of Lilith, and for a minute he confused that person with Rei. But she was standing beside him...or was the person beside him now up their.  
向上望去，源渡惊讶地张开了嘴，因为他看到一个人正坐在莉莉丝的肩上，有那么一会儿，他误以为那个人是绫波。但她正站在他旁边……或者现在站在那上面的是他旁边的人。

"Would you prefer it if I called you Gendo?" came Yui's voice.  
“你更喜欢我叫你源渡吗？”唯的声音传来。

Gendo stared up into the face of the person that he had always loved...Yui.  
源堂抬头凝视着那个他始终深爱的人...唯。

"Yui...what are you-" “唯...你这是在做什么-”

"Jeez, you've really made a mess of things," sighed Yui as she crossed her legs. "Not only did you steel Adam's DNA from Shinji, but you really intend on creating Third Impact just to see me again."  
“哎呀，你真是把事情搞得一团糟，”唯叹了口气，交叉着双腿说道，“你不仅从真嗣那里盗取了亚当的 DNA，还真的打算制造第三次冲击，只为再见我一面。”

"But you're right here...now...the soul of Unit 01-"  
"但你就近在咫尺...现在...初号机的灵魂-"

"Shinji will be fine without me with him," said Yui. "He's grown to be able to take care of himself, and those around him. It even seems that he's found someone he loves. Even though you two aren't even father and son, it seems that you two share similarities anyway. Maybe he picked up on certain things just by watching. As I recall, you'd always loved me since our high school days, we even dated a few times."  
"没有我在身边，真嗣也会好好的，" 由里说。"他已经成长到能够照顾自己，以及身边的人了。甚至看起来，他已经找到了心爱的人。尽管你们并非亲生父子，你们俩似乎还是有着相似之处。也许他是通过观察学到了一些东西。我记得，从高中时代起，你就一直爱着我，我们甚至还约会过几次。"

"Me and him are nothing alike," said Gendo abrasively.  
"我和他完全不像，" 源堂粗鲁地说道。"

"You always did look at it from a biological perspective," sighed Yui. "Maybe that's why you were never able to get along with him. But you did take care of him, and I suppose I should be grateful for that."  
"你总是从生物学的角度来看待问题，" 唯叹息道，"或许这就是你和他始终无法相处的原因。但你确实照顾了他，我想我应该为此感激你。"

"I only did so so I could get the DNA from him."  
"我这么做只是为了从他那里获取 DNA。"

"Liar," said Yui simply, "face it, you loved him in your own way, maybe because you found him as a link to me, though it seems you've found an adequate replacement for that as well."  
"骗子，" 唯简单地说，"面对现实吧，你以自己的方式爱着他，也许是因为你把他当作连接我的纽带，尽管现在看来你似乎也找到了足够的替代品。"

Yui said this as she nodded to Rei, who had not moved, or even gave indication she had heard Yui.  
优衣边说边向丽点头，而丽却一动不动，甚至没有任何迹象表明她听到了优衣的话。

"No Yui, you were always in my heart. Why do you think I went to such lengths to see again. Even now-"  
“不，优衣，你一直在我心里。你以为我为什么要费尽心思再次见到你。即便是现在——”

"But what about Shinji? What does he want? What does everyone else want? Why do you always think of yourself? Why are you always so selfish?"  
“那真嗣呢？他想要什么？其他人又想要什么？为什么你总是只考虑自己？为什么你总是这么自私？”

Yui suddenly jumped from the place she was sitting on Lilith's shoulders and flew down to the ground, landing easily and gracefully on the hard cement floor.  
优突然从她坐在莉莉丝肩膀上的位置跳了下来，轻盈地飞向地面，轻松优雅地落在坚硬的水泥地上。

"My selfishness may be overlooked by the fact that I love you," said Gendo convincingly.  
“我的自私可能会被我对你爱的这一事实所原谅，”碇源堂说服力十足地说道。

"Hmmm, that may be true," said Yui, "but don't forget Gendo that the current generation will never outlive the future, nor is the future determined by us adults, but by the future generation. You and Seele don't differentiate in this, and they still set incredible stock by the Dead Sea Scrolls, even though they were written by man."  
“嗯，这可能是真的，”优说，“但别忘了，碇源堂，现在的这一代人永远不会超越未来，未来也不是由我们成年人决定的，而是由未来的那一代人决定的。你和 Seele 在这点上没有区别，他们仍然对死海古卷寄予极高的信任，尽管它们是由人写成的。”

"I never said anything like that, it was only my wish to see you-"  
"我从未说过那样的话，我只是希望能见到你——"

"And you got to see me did you not? Is it really necessary for you to create Third Impact just for the sake of seeing me? Everyone will be as one, yet at the same time I will not be myself, and nor will you be yourself."  
"而你确实见到了我，不是吗？难道真的有必要为了见我而引发第三次冲击吗？所有人将合而为一，但与此同时，我将不再是我自己，你也不再是你自己。"

"But I didn't see anyway of seeing you otherwise-"  
"但除此之外，我找不到其他见到你的方法——"

"Did you ever consider death?" asked Yui.  
"你曾考虑过死亡吗？" 优问道。

Gendo was surprised by this question, for it was something he had never considered, and never would.  
源堂对这个问题的出现感到惊讶，因为他从未考虑过，也永远不会考虑。

"Of course not Yui, you were the person who taught me life always has meaning."  
"当然没有，优，是你教会了我生命总有其意义。"

"Then why are you so determined to turn all of humanity to soup just to see me again?"  
"那为什么你非要将全人类都变成汤，只为再见我一面？"

"Because I lov-" "因为我爱——"

"You loved me, I know that already. I've heard you telling me that at least three times in the last three minutes," she snapped at him.  
""你爱我，我知道这一点。过去三分钟里你至少跟我说了三次了，"" 她厉声对他说。

Gendo cringed back slightly at her words. Her voice had suddenly turned harsh.  
听到她的话，源堂微微退缩了一下。她的声音突然变得严厉。

"You always followed after me, even after I was already married, even after I had Shinji. During the creation of the Evangelions you still followed me around."  
“你总是跟在我后面，即使在我已经结婚之后，即使在我有了真嗣之后。在制造 EVA 期间，你依然在我周围徘徊。”

"But we were keeping up the facade that we were married. That you were my wife."  
“但我们一直在维持着我们结婚的假象。你是我的妻子。”

"And didn't you ever realize that you repulsed me!" Yui replied scornfully.  
"你难道从未意识到你让我感到厌恶吗！" 优愤怒地回答道。

Gendo felt like his entire world had shattered at her words. What had he been doing all his life then if what he thought true was not. The last fifteen years of his life had been wasted then. This, Nerv, Shinji, everything had been wasted away.  
听到她的话，源堂感觉自己的整个世界都崩塌了。如果他所坚信的一切都不是真的，那么他这一生都在做什么？过去十五年的生活都白白浪费了。这一切，NERV，真嗣，所有的一切都付诸东流了。

"Nothing...nothing whatsoever..."  
"什么都没有...什么都没有..."

"Never," replied Yui, "I never felt a thing for you, it was all in your imagination. The delusions of a lonely old man. That was probably why you cared for Shinji, because you always wanted a son of your own-"  
“从未，”优回答道，“我对你从未有过任何感觉，一切不过是你的臆想。一个孤独老人的妄想。或许这就是你关心真嗣的原因，因为你一直想要一个自己的孩子——”

Gendo broke at this point and rushed towards Yui, swinging his right arm downward and generating his own AT-field as he went. His AT-field crashed into Yui, instantly destroying her on the spot. A fountain of blood leapt on high where the upper part of her torso had been, spewing blood and gore across the room. Breathing heavily, Gendo looked down at his loved one with his eyes watering, making his glasses blurry and hard to see. He had blood drenched down the front of his normally neatly kept shirt and pants. But how could she have done it? How could she have rejected his feelings so brutally. How could she have-  
听到这里，源堂崩溃了，他冲向优，右臂猛地向下挥动，同时生成了自己的 AT 力场。他的 AT 力场撞击到优，瞬间将她当场摧毁。她的上半身原本所在之处，血柱喷涌而出，血肉横飞洒满了房间。源堂喘着粗气，泪水模糊了双眼，使得眼镜变得模糊不清。他平日里整洁的衬衫和裤子前襟已被鲜血浸透。但她怎能如此？她怎能如此残忍地拒绝他的感情。她怎能——

"You shouldn't have done that honey," came a sickening blood choked voice from his right. Gendo turned just to see Yui standing inches away from his face, half her face a bloody pulp and her eyes and ears bleeding like candle wax. Gendo just had time to open his mouth in half a scream when an AT-field cleanly sliced his rotted arm off, sending it skidding across the floor as black rotted blood shot out of the stump of an arm.  
"你不该那么做的，亲爱的，" 一个令人作呕的、血块堵塞的声音从他的右边传来。源堂转身，只见唯站在离他仅几英寸远的地方，半边脸血肉模糊，眼睛和耳朵像蜡烛一样流着血。源堂刚来得及张嘴发出半声尖叫，一个 AT 力场就干净利落地切掉了他那腐烂的手臂，让它在地板上滑行，黑色的腐血从断臂处喷涌而出。

Gendo screamed in agony as he cradled his destroyed arm. A black mucus like substance was slowly trickling out of his bloody arm, while the arm itself had turned an ashen black.  
源堂痛苦地尖叫着，抱着他那被毁的手臂。一种黑色的粘液状物质正慢慢地从他血淋淋的手臂中流出，而手臂本身已经变成了灰黑色。

"You should feel much better now that your human body doesn't have this eating into it, though I suppose thats little consolation to you."  
"现在你的肉体不再被这个侵蚀，你应该感觉好多了，尽管我想这对你是微不足道的安慰。"

Gendo looked up and saw that the person who was Yui was clutching the blackened arm that she had sliced off. The destroyed side of her face was slowly reforming itself, along with the bottom half, which floated below the torso, creating new tendons and nerves which formed together.  
源度抬头一看，发现那个自称是唯的人正紧抓着她切下的焦黑手臂。她被毁坏的那半边脸正缓慢地自我修复，下半身也悬浮在躯干下方，生成新的肌腱和神经，逐渐组合起来。

"You...you..." muttered Gendo as black blood frothed up and spilled out his mouth.  
“你……你……”源度喃喃自语，黑色的血液从他口中涌出，泡沫四溅。

"Yes?" spoke Yui as a purple mask materialized on her face. Next second, she pulled it off to reveal blankness: a face with nothing on it.  
“是吗？”唯说道，脸上随即浮现出一个紫色的面具。下一秒，她将其摘下，露出一张空无一物的脸。

"Lilith," mumbled Gendo. "莉莉丝，" 碇源堂咕哝道。

"Took you long enough," laughed Lilith. "And I thought you couldn't be nearly that stupid to believe that Yui was back in the present world. I mean, sure her soul is trapped in Unit 01, but for it to materialize here of all places. You'd have to be fuckin insane! Though I guess that fits with you."  
"你可算来了，" 莉莉丝笑道。"我还以为你不会蠢到相信唯会回到现世呢。我是说，她的灵魂确实被困在初号机里，但在这里显形？你得疯成什么样才会这么想！不过，这也挺符合你的风格。"

"You...everything..." "你...一切..."

"Sometimes I wonder if I made you too stupid when I created you humans. The black moon should have wizened you up a little, but then again I guess its best you don't get too smart."  
"有时候我会想，是不是我在创造你们人类时把你们造得太蠢了。那黑月本该让你们聪明些，但转念一想，你们最好还是别太聪明。"

Taking the arm and breaking it off at the hand, Lilith looked at it for a moment before she held it up to her stomach and her stomach seemed to open up for it, eating it as though it were a mouth.  
莉莉丝抓住那只手臂，将其从手腕处折断，她端详了一会儿，然后将断手举到自己的腹部，腹部仿佛张开了口，将断手吞噬，如同一张嘴在进食。

"Ah, finally I got the DNA of Adam. Sorry you had to go through all that trouble just to hand it over to myself."  
"啊，终于得到了亚当的 DNA。抱歉让你费了这么多周折，结果还是得交给我自己。"

Turning to Rei, she gestured towards her and said, "You'll of course be coming with me, since you are part of me after all. I'm sorry that I left you all alone like that, but you have been rather convenient when I haven't been around."  
转向丽，她向她示意并说道：“你当然会跟我来，毕竟你终究是我的一部分。很抱歉那样把你独自留下，但当我不在时，你确实相当方便。”

Rei finally seemed to acknowledge Lilith's presence and looked at her for a second before Lilith answered her unanswered question.  
丽终于似乎注意到了莉莉丝的存在，看了她一眼，随后莉莉丝回答了她未说出口的问题。

"We go to Shinji now of course...and her. Yes...I think this is best, and from the feel of things, the Eva Series has been defeated. Hmmm, and of course the Tree of Life awaits us." Turning back to Gendo, she said, "Well, I'm really sorry about deceiving you like that, but you know, a good portion of that was real after all, though I'm sure you know that already. You never know though, you may get lucky and see Yui in the next life, though that of course all depends on Shinji."  
“我们当然现在去找真嗣……还有她。是的……我认为这是最好的，而且从感觉来看，EVA 系列已经被击败了。嗯，当然，生命之树在等着我们。”她转回对源堂说，“好吧，真的很抱歉那样欺骗你，但你知道，那其中很大一部分毕竟是真实的，尽管我确信你已经知道了。不过，你永远不知道，你可能会在来世幸运地见到唯，当然，这一切都取决于真嗣。”

Lilith then floated upward with Rei, and stood before the giant body that was herself.  
莉莉丝随后与丽一同飘升，站在了那巨大的、属于她自己的躯体前。

"Time to start moving I suppose. Those two should be ready for me..."  
“看来是时候开始行动了。那两个人应该已经准备好迎接我了……”

---

Asuka continued looking over at Shinji as he resumed his staring up at the sky. She wondered what was making him so anxious, though she herself thought it more like nervousness. She had a million things that she wanted to ask him, but was either to unsure of herself, or that he would flat out refuse her if she asked something a bit...questionable.  
明日香继续注视着真嗣，他重新抬头望向天空。她想知道是什么让他如此焦虑，尽管她自己认为那更像是紧张。她有无数问题想问他，但要么是因为自己不够自信，要么是担心如果问了些稍微……敏感的问题，他会直接拒绝回答。

"Hey...Shinji?" "嘿...真嗣？"

Whether he ignored her or just didn't hear her, Asuka didn't know, but she continued anyway.  
他究竟是忽视了她，还是根本没听见，明日香不得而知，但她还是继续说了下去。

"How well...do you know me exactly?"  
“你到底……有多了解我？”

"Huh?" Shinji finally asked, though he continued looking up at the sky.  
“啊？” 真嗣终于问道，尽管他依旧仰望着天空。

"Do you know me?" "你认识我吗？"

Shinji paused for a moment before he asked, "What do you mean?"  
真嗣顿了一下，然后问道：“你是什么意思？”

"How well do you know me? Misato said something before, about her watching us grow up together."  
"你对我了解多少？美里之前说过一些话，关于她看着我们一起长大的。"

Shinji was silent, unsure of how he should reply. Asuka was acting the complete opposite of what he had expected from her. When he had threatened her with his AT-field, he had been certain that she would not follow him, was certain that she wouldn't be in his life anymore. But she became curious again, and Shinji was starting to wonder if part of that was because of how he had acted when he had said goodbye to her. He was positive that that was the last time he was seeing her when he left her and Rei at the elevator, but now seeing her in front of him, and guessing what she had gone through to obtain Unit 02 again... He wasn't sure about anything anymore.  
真嗣沉默了，不确定该如何回应。明日香的行为与他预期的完全相反。当他用 AT 力场威胁她时，他确信她不会跟随他，确信她不会再出现在他的生活中。但她再次变得好奇，真嗣开始怀疑这其中有部分原因是因为他向她告别时的行为。当他离开她和绫波在电梯旁时，他确信那是最后一次见到她，但现在看到她站在面前，猜测她为了再次获得二号机所经历的一切...他现在对任何事情都不确定了。

"Why do you think I know you?" he said eventually. "We only meet a few-"  
“你为什么觉得我了解你？”他最终说道，“我们只见过几次——”

"Like I said," replied Asuka testily. "Misato told me that she was glad she could see us grow up together."  
“就像我说的，”明日香不耐烦地回答，“美里告诉我，她很高兴能看到我们一起长大。”

Shrugging, Shinji said, "She was lying."  
耸了耸肩，真嗣说：“她在撒谎。”

"No she wasn't...not the way she said it. It was one of the only things I know to be true."  
“不，她没有……她说的方式。那是我所知的为数不多真实的事情之一。”

"Why is that?" “为什么这么说？”

"Because of the way you denied it."  
"正是因为你否认的方式。"

Shinji blinked, not expecting her to say something like that.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，没想到她会说出这样的话。

"...Shinji," said Asuka after a moment of silence. "What were we to each other? Why do I feel so...confused every time I talk to you? Why is it that I'm able to be so open with you, even though I barely know you?"  
"...真嗣，"明日香在片刻沉默后说道。"我们彼此算是什么呢？为什么每次和你说话我都感到如此...困惑？为什么我能对你如此坦诚，尽管我对你几乎一无所知？"

"No idea," said Shinji with no emotion.  
“不知道，”真嗣毫无表情地说。

Asuka looked at him in Unit 02 before she sighed and said, "Fine, be that way."  
明日香在二号机里看着他，叹了口气说：“好吧，随你便。”

Shinji turned away from her quickly then, not wanting to have to see her. He was having difficulties keeping his emotions in check, especially the angel half of him. He had always known that Asuka had a strong will, but he had never guessed she'd be able to retain a part of her emotions towards him.  
真嗣迅速转过身去，不想看到她。他正努力控制自己的情绪，尤其是他天使那一半的情绪。他一直知道明日香意志坚强，但他从未料到她能保留一部分对他的情感。

"...Shinji," came Asuka's voice suddenly very close to him. Hearing this, Shinji quickly turned back around and saw that Unit 02 was directly in front of him.  
"...真嗣," 明日香的声音突然在他耳边响起。听到这，真嗣迅速转过身来，发现零二号机正直接站在他面前。

"What are you-" Shinji started quickly, but cut himself off as the entry plug of Unit 02 suddenly shot out of the neck of Unit 02. Watching silently, as though he couldn't believe what he was seeing, Shinji saw Asuka climb out of the entry plug and slid down its smooth surface. Standing up, Asuka looked towards Unit 01 and opened her mouth before shouting-  
"你这是要-" 真嗣急忙开口，但话未说完，零二号机的插入栓突然从颈部弹射出来。默默地看着，仿佛不敢相信自己的眼睛，真嗣看到明日香从插入栓中爬出，顺着光滑的表面滑下。站稳后，明日香望向零一号机，张开嘴大喊——

"IDIOT!" "笨蛋！"

Shinji was so surprised by her sudden shout that he almost toppled over inside Unit 01. How could she be so stubborn as to pull something like this?  
真嗣被她突如其来的喊声吓了一跳，差点在初号机里摔倒。她怎么能如此固执，做出这种事来？

"What the hell do you think you're doing?" shouted Shinji with almost equal volume. "Get back inside Unit 02 and-"  
“你到底在搞什么鬼？”真嗣几乎同样大声地喊道，“快回到二号机里去，然后——”

"I won't," replied Asuka as she crossed her arms. "Not until you tell me what happened between us!"  
“我不，”明日香交叉双臂回答，“除非你告诉我我们之间发生了什么！”

"Nothing happened you moron!" yelled Shinji.  
“什么都没发生，你个白痴！”真嗣吼道。

Asuka stood her ground though and put her hands on her hips.  
但明日香依然站在原地，双手叉腰。

"Shinji, I'm not stupid. I know everybody's been lying to me since the moment I woke up from whatever the hell happened to me. Maybe my mind was invaded by an angel, maybe it wasn't and something else happened. I don't know, nor do I fucking care how I lost my memory anymore. What I can't stand is that you keep on ignoring whatever it is we had. Maybe you want to forget it for your own reasons, and I can understand that with what you've been through. But I'm telling you this right now: I understand you! We are alike Shinji, and thats why I think I'm drawn to you, ass-hole as you may be. I fucking hate it, and can't stand seeing your stupid face every damn day as though no matter where I go I see you. But the other part of me wants to know you, really know you. I don't care what you say, or how you act around me, because I know that you were doing it to shun me. Maybe you thought it was best that we didn't see each other, because of whatever happened between us, whatever happened to me that caused that section of my memory to be erased. But everything that I remember, there are large blanks, and not just of the Eva battles. At school, at Misato's apartment, here at Nerv, it's almost as though somebody was cut out of my life. I don't like not knowing what that was, because I believe that those were the happiest moments of my life, those memories which I no longer have. So please tell me, I want to know what we were, what we had. Even if its something that I wont like...I don't care. I want you to tell me Shinji..."  
"真嗣，我并不傻。自从我醒来，知道所有人都一直在对我撒谎。也许我的意识被天使入侵了，也许没有，而是发生了别的事情。我不知道，也不再他妈的在乎我是如何失去记忆的。我无法忍受的是，你一直在忽视我们曾经拥有的东西。也许你有自己的理由想要忘记，考虑到你所经历的一切，我能理解。但我现在要告诉你：我理解你！我们很相似，真嗣，这就是为什么我觉得被你吸引，尽管你是个混蛋。我他妈的讨厌这样，每天看到你那张蠢脸，无论我走到哪里都能见到你，这让我无法忍受。但另一部分的我想要了解你，真正了解你。我不在乎你怎么说，或者在我面前怎么表现，因为我知道你那样做是为了避开我。也许你认为我们不见面是最好的，因为无论我们之间发生了什么，无论是什么导致了我那部分记忆被抹去。但我记得的一切，都有巨大的空白，不仅仅是关于 EVA 的战斗。" 在学校，在美里小姐的公寓，在这里的 NERV，仿佛有人从我的生活中被剪除。我不喜欢不知道那是什么感觉，因为我认为那些是我一生中最快乐的时刻，那些我不再拥有的记忆。所以请告诉我，我想知道我们曾经是什么，我们拥有过什么。即使那是我不会喜欢的东西……我也不在乎。我想让你告诉我，真嗣……"

Asuka took a deep breath as she finished this and then exhaled, releasing all her pent up thoughts and emotions in the process. Feeling tired slightly, she rested her hands on her knees for a minute as she allowed herself to catch her breath, and then looked up at Unit 01 and Shinji, who hadn't moved an inch.  
明日香深吸一口气，说完这些后缓缓呼出，将所有积压的思想和情感一并释放。感到些许疲惫，她将双手放在膝盖上休息了一会儿，让自己喘口气，然后抬头看向初号机和真嗣，他依然一动不动。

"Your answer..." she whispered softly.  
"你的回答..." 她轻声细语。

Shinji watched her from the cockpit of Unit 01, his mind a blur. Everything he had ever done with Asuka, every word he had spoken to her, every caress of her skin, or touch of her hair whirled around his mind until he became dizzy of it. It made him sick that he could be brought to his knees with such words. He hated himself for letting her words affect him so, but still, a small part of him also wanted it to happen. The possible hope that maybe things could go back to what they were.  
真嗣从 01 号机的驾驶舱里注视着她，思绪一片混乱。他与明日香所做的一切，他对她说的每一句话，每一次轻抚她的肌肤，或是触碰她的发丝，都在他的脑海中旋转，直到他感到眩晕。他厌恶自己竟会因这些话语而屈服。他痛恨自己让她的言语如此影响自己，但内心深处，仍有一小部分渴望这一切发生。那一线可能，或许事情能回到从前。

'But thats all a lie,' he told himself. 'You're just imagining what you want to happen and not worrying about the actuality of it. Its impossible! I made my mind up a long time ago!'  
'但这都是谎言，'他对自己说。'你只是在幻想你希望发生的事，而不去考虑现实。这是不可能的！我很久以前就下定决心了！'

'But she wants to try nonetheless, even though she knows the risks of it. And would she be here if she didn't care for you? Here at the center of everything.'  
“但她仍然想尝试，尽管她知道其中的风险。如果她不关心你，她还会在这里吗？在这个一切的中心。”

'But we don't know if we can survive it, I don't know if I can!'  
“但我们不知道我们能否挺过去，我不知道我是否能做到！”

'Isn't that the point of it? You don't know if will work, but you don't know if it wont work either.'  
“这不就是它的意义所在吗？你不知道它是否会成功，但你也同样不知道它是否会失败。”

'I can't deal with the uncertainty.'  
'我无法面对这种不确定性。'

'You have to if you want to reconcile everything. Your feelings for each other will certainly-"  
'如果你想和解一切，就必须面对。你们之间的感情肯定会——'

'What feelings! Its just a shadow of something that used to exist!'  
'什么感情！那只是曾经存在过的一丝影子罢了！'

'...But it did use to exist, and there is value in that. Why don't you just admit that you feel for her?'  
“……但它曾经存在过，这本身就有其价值。你为何不承认你对她的感觉呢？”

'I don't feel anything for that bitch! I never did!'  
“我对那个婊子没有任何感觉！从来都没有！”

'Then what was the kiss about?'  
“那那个吻又是怎么回事？”

Shinji's eyes flew open at that as the very vivid memory came rushing back to him. The darkness of the room, the outline of her body resting comfortably on the hospital bed, the warmth of her lips as he kissed her-  
听到这话，真嗣的眼睛猛地睁开，那段极为生动的记忆如潮水般涌回他的脑海。房间的昏暗，她安详地躺在病床上的轮廓，以及他亲吻她时唇间的温暖——

"Its a lie," mumbled Shinji inside Unit 01.  
“这是谎言，”真嗣在初号机内喃喃自语。

'Whats a lie and what isn't?'  
“什么是谎言，什么又不是？”

"I don't know..." “我不知道...”

'Why are you doing this to yourself?'  
‘你为什么要这样折磨自己？’

"I don't know..." “我不知道...”

'Why wont you try?' '为什么你不试试呢？'

"I don't know..." "我不知道……"

'Are you scared?' '你害怕吗？'

"...Maybe..." "...也许..."

'What are you scared of?'  
“你在害怕什么？”

"...Knowing that she's not okay. Knowing that I did something to harm her. I can't...let that happen... I can't-"  
"...知道她不好。知道我做了伤害她的事。我不能...让那发生...我不能-"

Shinji? 真嗣？

"No...I don't want to let that happen to her. I don't-  
不……我不想让她经历那种事。我不想——

Shinji? 真嗣？

"Because of her I...I was able to continue...without her I-  
"因为她，我...我才能够继续...没有她，我——"

Shinji! 真嗣！

"Don't bother me, I don't know, I don't know!"  
"别烦我，我不知道，我不知道！"

"SHINJI!" "真嗣！"

"WHAT!" he shouted with everything he could muster. Realizing that he had been stationary for several minutes, he looked around wildly before his eyes settled on Asuka.  
"什么！" 他用尽全力大喊。意识到自己已经静止了几分钟，他疯狂地环顾四周，直到目光落在明日香身上。

"Asu...ka," he mumbled. Blinking several times, he noticed something pearly white floating in the entry plug before disappearing because of the high concentration of LCL fluid.  
"明日...香，" 他喃喃自语。眨了几次眼，他注意到插入口栓内有一片珍珠白的物体漂浮，随后因 LCL 液的高浓度而消失。

"My...tears?" he wondered.  
"我的...眼泪？" 他疑惑道。

"Shinji! Answer me!" Asuka suddenly shouted at him. "What am I to you! What are we together!"  
"真嗣！回答我！" 明日香突然对他大喊。"我对你来说是什么！我们在一起又算什么！"

"You...Me...We..." Shinji repeated.  
"你...我...我们..." 真嗣重复道。

Ah...so thats it... 啊...原来如此...

I think I know...the answer  
我想我知道...答案

Shinji smiled slightly at his realization, something that he had been running away from the entire time.  
真嗣微微一笑，意识到自己一直在逃避的东西。

Asuka continued watching Unit 01 waiting for a response from Shinji. Though when it didn't seem he was gonna reply again, she started opening her mouth, but as she did, the entry plug from Unit 01 was ejected out. Asuka eyes widened just as Shinji's had done as he stepped out of the entry plug. Instead of sliding down it as Asuka had done though, he materialized his AT-field and seemed to be jumping from ledge to ledge in midair as he made his way down to Unit 01's shoulder.  
明日香继续注视着初号机，等待真嗣的回应。然而，当他似乎不打算再次回答时，她开始张嘴，但就在这时，初号机的插入栓被弹射出来。明日香的眼睛瞪大了，就像真嗣之前那样，他从插入栓中走出。与明日香滑下来的方式不同，他利用 AT 力场，在空中仿佛跳跃般从一处跃到另一处，最终降落在初号机的肩膀上。

"Shinji..." Asuka whispered slightly as Shinji feet final touched down on Unit 01's shoulder. He didn't move from that spot.  
"真嗣..." 明日香轻声低语，当真嗣的双脚终于稳稳落在初号机的肩膀上时。他没有从那个位置移动。

"Asuka!" Shinji suddenly shouted at her, catching her slightly off balance with his shout. Catching herself before she slid down its back-  
"明日香！" 真嗣突然向她大喊，他的喊声让她有些措手不及。她稳住自己，才没有从它的背上滑落——

"You idiot!" she shouted back at him. "You almost made me fall-"  
"你这个笨蛋！" 她朝他回喊道。"你差点让我摔下去——"

"We were friends!" "我们是朋友！"

"...Huh?" "...啊？"

Shinji stared back at her with such determination that Asuka felt her cheeks turn pink slightly.  
真嗣坚定地回望着她，这让明日香感到自己的脸颊微微泛红。

"F-Friends? Don't be an idiot, we hate each other. We-"  
"朋友？别犯傻了，我们互相讨厌。我们——"

"Thats not it though!" Shinji shouted back at her, silencing her almost instantly. "Asuka you...you were somebody who was irreplaceable in my life. Someone special...and I think you felt the same towards me."  
"不是那样的！" 真嗣朝她喊回去，几乎立刻让她安静下来。"明日香，你……你是我生命中无可替代的人。一个特别的存在……我想你对我也有同样的感觉。"

"Huh? Did you hit your head climbing out of that entry plug?"  
"哈？你从插入栓里爬出来时是不是撞到头了？"

Shinji laughed silently. "You're exactly as you used to be, always thinking up stuff like that on the spot. The truth is, we both lived at Misato's apartment during our time at Nerv. We went to school together, ate meals together, watched T.V. together, and fought the angels together. Everything we did was together...because we formed a bond."  
真嗣无声地笑了。“你还是老样子，总是能即兴想出这些点子。事实上，我们在 NERV 期间都住在美里小姐的公寓里。我们一起上学，一起吃饭，一起看电视，一起对抗使徒。我们所做的一切都是在一起的……因为我们之间形成了一种纽带。”

"...Now I really think something is wrong with you," said Asuka as she held her face in her hands, though she was smiling slightly.  
“……现在我真的觉得你有点问题，”明日香双手捧着脸说，尽管她的嘴角微微上扬。

"Nothing is wrong with me...at least now," said Shinji. "I was just denying everything...I didn't want to admit it, because then I'd have to realize how wrong I was."  
“我没什么问题……至少现在没有，”真嗣说。“我只是否认了一切……我不想承认，因为那样我就得意识到自己错得有多离谱。”

"What were you wrong about?"  
“你错在哪里了？”

Shinji was silent for a minute before finally take a breath and saying, "I suppose it would be the bond I talked about earlier. I took it for granted...and things ended up as they did."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，终于深吸一口气，说道：“我想，应该是我之前提到的那个羁绊吧。我把它视为理所当然...结果事情就变成了这样。”

Asuka frowned slightly as she looked at him.  
明日香微微皱眉，看着他。

"So...we were friends..."  
"所以...我们是朋友..."

"We argued a lot, and made fun of each other, but we were definitely friends. Looking out for each other when the other was down, helping the other in their time of need. Honestly, if it wasn't for you being there with me, I would have lost control of my angel powers a long time ago."  
"我们经常争吵，互相取笑，但我们绝对是朋友。在对方低落时互相照顾，在对方需要时伸出援手。老实说，如果不是有你在身边，我早就无法控制我的天使力量了。"

"But why don't I remember any of this? I mean...I remember some I suppose, flashes and such. But-"  
"但为什么我一点都记不起来？我是说...我好像记得一些片段。但是-"

"The angels," said Shinji simply. "From what I remember Ritsuko telling me, the angel that invaded your mind searched for memories of me. It was too much of a strain though and everything that was related to me was destroyed so that the rest of your mind would remain intact."  
"那些使徒，" 真嗣简单地说道。"根据我记得的律子告诉我的，侵入你心灵的那个使徒在寻找关于我的记忆。但那压力太大了，所有与我相关的记忆都被摧毁，以确保你其余的心灵完好无损。

"And you didn't think to help me regain them? You said that we helped each other when the other was troubled."  
"而你没想到要帮我恢复它们吗？你说过我们在对方困扰时互相帮助。

"I didn't want to risk the chance of harming you further. The way I saw it, everything that you had ever been through was a direct link with me. If you no longer had anything to do with me, then you would be fine. Though you became interested in me of your own free will, which I didn't expect. It goes back to the bond that we formed."  
"我不想冒险进一步伤害你。在我看来，你所经历的一切都与我直接相关。如果你不再与我有关联，那么你会没事的。尽管你出于自己的意愿对我产生了兴趣，这是我未曾预料到的。这又回到了我们形成的纽带。

"I don't understand..." "我不明白..."

"What don't you understand."  
"你不明白什么？"

Asuka looked at him for a few seconds, bit down on her lips before she said, "Alright, so we were friends. But I still don't understand why you tried to stay away from me to the point of threatening me."  
绫波看了他几秒钟，咬了咬嘴唇，然后说：“好吧，我们是朋友。但我还是不明白，你为什么要试图远离我，甚至威胁我。”

"Asuka...I've seen you die too many times, and I don't care to live out any of those scenarios."  
“明日香...我目睹你死去太多次了，我不想再经历那些场景。”

"Wh-What are you talking about?"  
“什、什么意思？”

Shinji was silent for a minute until he looked up towards the cloudy sky and said, "As best as I can tell, there is only one plane on which this planet rests, only one dimension where I exist and where you exist. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't know. I can see visions of possible futures, and based on that information I can change the outcomes of the futures by altering my actions and the actions of others around me. I've seen you die in many different scenarios, all of which I was able to prevent. But there was always that thought of 'what if' in the back of my mind. 'What if I made a mistake? What if she dies?' That thought gnawed at me until the day your memories of me disappeared and you became unfit to pilot Unit 02. I decided that I would walk away from you then, and not involve myself with you."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后抬头望向阴云密布的天空，说道：“据我所知，这个星球只有一个层面，只有一个维度，我存在，你也存在。也许我错了，但我不确定。我能看到可能的未来景象，基于这些信息，我可以通过改变自己的行为和周围人的行为来改变未来的结果。我见过你在许多不同的情境中死去，所有这些我都能阻止。但我的脑海里总有一个‘如果’的念头。‘如果我犯了错怎么办？如果她死了怎么办？’这个念头一直困扰着我，直到你失去了关于我的记忆，不再适合驾驶二号机。那时我决定离开你，不再与你牵扯。”

"But that didn't work," finished Asuka quietly.  
"但那并没有奏效，" 明日香轻声说道。

"No, that didn't," said Shinji as he looked back at her. "You searched me out and tried talking to me. I don't know if that was your superiority complex, or simple curiosity. The worst mistake I probably made though was going to Misato's apartment after swearing to never step foot in there again. I thought I could deal with seeing you again, seeing you in an environment I was so used to. The empty room at her apartment, used to be my room. But I was wrong, and everything went down hill from there, especially today. I destroyed the elevators in the Evangelion chamber, thinking you'd never make it there, but you found a way in. Not to mention you're still able to pilot Unit 02, though I suppose that has something to do with your mom."  
"是的，那没有奏效，" 真嗣回望着她说。"你找到我并试图与我交谈。我不知道那是你的优越情结，还是单纯的求知欲。我可能犯的最糟糕的错误是，在发誓再也不踏入那里之后，又去了美里小姐的公寓。我以为我可以再次面对你，在你我如此熟悉的环境中。她公寓里那个空房间，曾经是我的房间。但我错了，从那以后一切都急转直下，尤其是今天。我毁掉了 EVA 格纳库的电梯，以为你永远到不了那里，但你找到了进去的方法。更不用说你仍然能够驾驶 02 号机，尽管我想这和你妈妈有关。"

Asuka crossed her arms and looked at him while frowning slightly. "There are still a lot of things that I don't understand, and your logic makes so sense. So what if you saw me dying thousands or even hundreds of thousands of times. They weren't real!"  
明日香交叉双臂，微微皱眉看着他。"还有很多事情我不明白，你的逻辑毫无道理。就算你看到我死了成千上万次，那些都不是真的！"

"How would you like it if you saw someone you cared for dying repeatedly and all you could do was stand there and watch."  
"如果你看到你在乎的人一遍遍地死去，而你只能站在那里看着，你会怎么想？"

"I-Idiot, don't say it like that. Someone you care for...makes it sound like..."  
"我——白痴，别这么说。你关心的人……听起来像……"

Asuka's face was scrunched up slightly in embarrassment now at Shinji's words.  
听到真嗣的话，明日香的脸微微皱起，显得有些尴尬。

"Now let me ask you something," said Shinji. "How much do you remember."  
"现在让我问你一个问题，" 真嗣说道。"你还记得多少？"

"I told you, just flashes of things, but whenever I'm around you...hmmm...I don't know how to say it. But the earrings...and the fried rice you made, those I think are the things that stand out vividly for me."  
"我告诉过你，只是一些片段，但每当我靠近你...嗯...我不知道该怎么表达。但那些耳环...还有你做的炒饭，我觉得这些是我记得特别清楚的事情。"

"Objects then," sighed Shinji.  
"那么，是物品了，" 真嗣叹息道。"

"And certain emotions I feel occasionally," Asuka replied. "...Hey Shinji?" Asuka said after a few moments.  
"偶尔我也会感受到某些情绪，" 明日香回答道。"...嘿，真嗣？" 几秒钟后，明日香说道。

"What?" "什么？"

"How much do you remember?"  
"你还记得多少？"

"More than you do, but its hazy. A lot I forgot after my battle with Kaoru, because my angel powers woke all the way. If I try, I can remember things though..."  
"比你记得的多，但很模糊。很多事情在我与薰战斗后都忘记了，因为我的使徒力量完全觉醒了。但如果我努力回想，还是能记起一些事情的..."

"What about after all this?"  
"这一切之后呢？"

"...After this?" "...之后呢？"

"I want you to tell me more...about when we lived in Misato's apartment, and I also want to hear it from Misato herself."  
"我想让你多告诉我一些...关于我们在美里公寓生活时的事，我也想听美里亲自讲述。"

"Yeah...that will be okay," said Shinji, not voicing the problems with that promise.  
"嗯...那样也好，" 真嗣说道，并未提及那个承诺中的问题。

"One last thing Shinji." "还有最后一件事，真嗣。"

"Huh?" "啊？"

"...You know...never mind, I don't think I want to know that..."  
"...你知道的...算了，我想我还是不想知道那件事..."

"Hmmm? Okay then," mumbled Shinji.  
“嗯？好吧，”真嗣咕哝道。

'Its fine like this,' he told himself. 'If its just like this, then its fine...'  
“这样就好，”他对自己说。“如果只是这样，那就没问题...”

'But you lied,' said a small voice in his head.  
“但你撒谎了，”他脑海中有个小小的声音说道。

'Friends...just friends...'  
'朋友...只是朋友...'

"Asuka, its best if we get back in our Eva Units..."  
"明日香，我们最好回到 Eva 机体里..."

"Huh? Oh...you're probably right."  
"嗯？哦...你可能是对的。"

Smiling ever so slightly, Asuka turned away from Shinji, her strawberry colored hair flowing behind her and started climbing back up Unit 02 to the entry plug. Shinji meanwhile watched her ascend the entire way until he was positive that she was inside her entry plug.  
阿斯克轻轻一笑，转身离开真嗣，她那草莓色的长发随风飘扬，开始攀爬回零二号机插入栓。与此同时，真嗣一直注视着她，直到确信她已进入插入栓。

'This is enough,' he thought.  
“这样就够了，”他心想。

Turning towards Unit 01, he looked up into its face and let out a low sigh. Knowing what likely came next, he used his AT-field to jump through the air back to his entry plug. Though he stopped in mid air as he felt something. Looking down towards the ground, his gazed pierced through the earth and down into the bowels of Terminal Dogma where he felt a strong AT-field drawing quickly towards them.  
他转向零一号机，抬头凝视着它的面容，发出一声低叹。预感到接下来可能发生的事情，他利用 AT 力场跃入空中，返回自己的插入栓。然而，他在半空中停了下来，因为他感受到了某种异样。低头望向地面，他的目光穿透大地，直达终端教条的深处，在那里他感觉到一股强大的 AT 力场正迅速向他们逼近。

'Lilith? No...Ayanami?' '莉莉丝？不...绫波？'

Knowing that he didn't have time, he hurried back into Unit 01's entry plug and through himself at the controls.  
明知时间紧迫，他急忙返回初号机的插入栓，猛地扑向控制台。

"Asuka!" he yelled quickly at her.  
“明日香！”他迅速朝她喊道。

"Huh? What do you want now? Or is there something else you want to say-"  
"嗯？你现在又想要什么？还是说你还有什么别的话想说-"

"No! We've got a problem! Lilith is coming. Get out of here fast!"  
"不！我们有麻烦了！莉莉丝来了。快离开这里！"

"Idiot, didn't I say that I'm staying with you-"  
"笨蛋，我不是说过我要和你一起留下来吗-"

"That doesn't matter right now! What matters is that you get out of here now-"  
“现在那不重要！重要的是你现在就得离开这里——”

...Too late... ……太迟了……

A white shape emerged out of the ground aways away from where Unit 02 stood. It seemed to pass directly through the earth as though it was transparent. Limbs sprung forth from the ground as the massive body of Lilith continued upwards into the sky. As Shinji continued watching though, he noticed that the mask it had worm before was gone, and that now a face similar to that of Ayanami Rei adorned it. The eyes were a blood red just as Shinji's, but he could feel a malice which he had never felt before.  
一个白色身影从远离二号机站立处的地方破土而出。它似乎直接穿透了地面，仿佛是透明的。四肢从地面伸出，莉莉丝庞大的身躯继续向天空伸展。然而，真嗣注意到，它之前戴的面具已经不见了，取而代之的是一张与绫波零相似的面孔。眼睛同样是真嗣那样的血红色，但他能感受到一种前所未有的恶意。

'We have to move,' he thought. Turning towards Asuka, he was about to tell her this, but saw that her mind was preoccupied on something else. The Eva Series, which they seemed to have defeated were rising up again and pulling the many Lances of Longinus out of their bodies.  
“我们必须行动，”他心想。转向明日香，正要告诉她这一点，却发现她的心思似乎在别处。那些看似已被他们击败的 EVA 系列，正再次升起，并从体内拔出众多朗基努斯之枪。

'No...way,' thought Shinji. 'Even now, they still aren't defeated?'  
“不可能……”真嗣心想，“即便现在，它们还未被击败吗？”

Turning his gaze back to Lilith, he saw that white wings were sprouting from her back. As he continued watching in horror, he thought briefly of Gendo, and what had happened to him, but brushed it aside. He didn't have to worry about that bastard anymore. But where was Ayanami?  
他将目光转回莉莉丝，看到她背后长出了白色的翅膀。在惊恐中继续观察时，他短暂地想起了碇源堂，以及他遭遇了什么，但随即抛开这些念头。他再也不必担心那个混蛋了。但绫波在哪里呢？

For answer, he had to look at the spot between Lilith's breasts. The body of Ayanami Rei seemed to have joined with that of Lilith's. One body, one mind.  
为了寻找答案，他不得不注视着莉莉丝胸口之间的位置。绫波丽的身体似乎与莉莉丝的融为一体。一个身体，一个意识。

"Ayanami..." Shinji whispered, not believing what he was seeing. But no, he had to focus on somebody else. Asuka was in danger.  
“绫波……” 真嗣低声呢喃，不敢相信眼前所见。但不行，他必须关注其他人。明日香正处于危险之中。

"Asuka!" he shouted as he turned towards her. Though again, she didn't respond. Thinking quickly, he didn't see any alternative and quickly rushed to Unit 02 side. Not knowing whether this would work or not, he projected his AT-field and encased it around the entry plug of Unit 02. Yelling with everything he had he shouted hoarsely at her-  
“明日香！”他转身大喊。然而，她依旧没有回应。他迅速思考，别无选择，立刻冲向二号机的位置。不知此举是否有效，他展开了自己的 AT 力场，将其包裹在二号机的插入栓周围。他用尽全力嘶吼着——

"ASUKA!" “明日香！”

His feelings seemed to have gotten through to her, because the glassy eyed expression she had had disappeared as she heard his voice. Looking around quickly, she jumped suddenly as she seemed to notice the strange presence that was enveloping her.  
他的情感似乎传达到了她，因为她那原本呆滞的眼神在他声音的触碰下消失了。她迅速环顾四周，突然跳了起来，仿佛察觉到了正包围着她的那种奇异存在。

"Shinji wha-" “真嗣，什——”

"Don't worry about it," he yelled back at her, hoping she hadn't felt the emotion that had filled him up as he used his AT-field.  
“别担心，”他朝她大喊，希望她没有感受到当他使用 AT 力场时充斥在他心中的情感。

"But-" "但——"

"No time! Just get out of here now!"  
"没时间了！现在就离开这里！"

"But you-" "但你——"

"I'll be fine! Just move it! If anything happens to you..." Shinji left his sentence dangling not willing to voice those words, and admittedly, he was still stubbornly lying to himself.  
"我会没事的！快走吧！如果你们出了什么事..." 真嗣没有把话说完，不愿吐露那些字眼，而且坦白说，他仍在固执地欺骗自己。

Asuka was silent for a second before she finally nodded her head and said, "Alright, if it means that much to you...but if you need any help-"  
明日香沉默了一会儿，最终点点头说："好吧，如果这对你是那么重要...但如果你需要任何帮助——"

"I'll be fine," Shinji curtly cut across her.  
"我会没事的，" 真嗣生硬地打断了她。

Asuka gazed at him for a few seconds longer before she nodded her head and said, "I know...just a little longer then..."  
明日香又凝视了他几秒钟，然后点点头说：“我知道……再一会儿就好……”

"Yes," replied Shinji, not quiet understanding what she was getting at.  
“是的，”真嗣回答，不太明白她指的是什么。

"Be safe," said Asuka. As she said this, an almost uncontrollable desire to grab ahold of Shinji and wrap him in her warmth seemed to envelop her, but she pushed it to the back of her mind. If there was an after...well...  
“要小心，”明日香说。在说这话时，一种几乎无法控制的冲动想要抓住真嗣，将他包裹在自己的温暖中，但她将这种感觉推到了心底。如果有来世……嗯……

Without another word, Asuka turned away with Unit 02 and past Unit 01, running in the opposite direction. Though unbeknownst to Shinji, Asuka was silently crying...  
没有再多说一句话，明日香转身带着二号机从初号机旁跑向相反的方向。尽管真嗣并不知情，明日香正默默地哭泣着...

Shinji didn't turn around as Asuka left; only his eyes were fixed on Lilith and the Eva Units, being sure that they wouldn't pursue Asuka. Though when he was certain that she was far enough away, he finally spoke.  
明日香离开时，真嗣没有回头；他的目光始终固定在莉莉丝和 EVA 机体上，确保它们不会追击明日香。直到确信她已经足够远离，他才终于开口。

"Lilith...what do you want with me? And furthermore, I'm telling you only once to let Ayanami go,"  
“莉莉丝...你想要我做什么？而且，我只说一次，放了绫波。”

Lilith was silent for a while, silently glaring down at Shinji until she finally spoke, though it was with Ayanami's voice.  
莉莉丝沉默了一会儿，默默地瞪着真嗣，直到她终于开口，尽管是用绫波的声音。

"What I want with you? Well thats nothing new really. I'm mainly curious about you from an angelic point of view. Though strictly speaking, I'm something of an aunt to you. Rather interesting...isn't it?"  
“我对你有什么企图？其实也没什么新鲜的。我主要是从天使的角度对你感到好奇。虽然严格来说，我算是你的姑姑。相当有趣……不是吗？”

"Let Ayanami go right now!"  
“立刻放了绫波！”

"Why? Its not like she belongs here anyway. She was part of me to begin with."  
“为什么？反正她也不属于这里。她原本就是我的一部分。”

"She is her own person, and you don't have that liberty to take it away from her."  
“她是独立的个体，你没有权利剥夺她的自由。”

"Certainly I do. She was born from me after all. All I'm doing is taking back what was once mine."  
“当然我有。她毕竟是从我这里诞生的。我所做的不过是取回曾经属于我的东西。”

Shinji shook his head and mumbled, "But she isn't just you, she's a separate person."  
真嗣摇了摇头，咕哝道：“但她不只是你，她是一个独立的人。”

"Does she have a soul," asked Lilith almost sounding bored. Shinji was silently however, as he didn't have an answer to that.  
“她有灵魂吗？”莉莉丝几乎听起来有些厌倦地问道。真嗣沉默不语，因为他对此没有答案。

"Exactly," continued Lilith. "The person known as Ayanami Rei never had a soul, only my own soul which I lent her. You can't call that a person. But what is a person except for a bunch of LCL fluid. Tabris told you about the creation correct?"  
“正是如此，”莉莉丝继续说道，“被称为绫波零的那个人从未拥有过灵魂，只有我借给她的我的灵魂。你不能称之为一个人。但除了 LCL 液体，一个人又是什么呢？塔布里斯告诉过你关于创造的事情，对吧？”

"...He did," mumbled Shinji.  
"...他确实做了，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"Then you already know how humans came to exist, so I can save that blather. But nevertheless, we still need to talk."  
"那么你已经知道人类是如何存在的了，我就不必赘述那些废话。但尽管如此，我们还是需要谈谈。"

"I have nothing to say to you."  
"我没什么可跟你说的。"

"Oh? You don't want to here about your birth? How you came to be and your mother and Adam's relationship. Or what about your visions? How about everything you've seen and heard including that special girl of yours."  
"哦？你不想听听关于你出生的故事吗？你是如何来到这个世界，以及你母亲和亚当的关系。还是说你的那些预见？你看到和听到的所有事情，包括你那位特别的女孩。"

"Leave Asuka out of this," Shinji growled back at Lilith.  
"别把明日香扯进来，" 真嗣对莉莉丝咆哮道。

"Oh...testy. So you do care for her after all?"  
"哦……脾气不小。看来你确实在乎她呢？"

"I said to leave her out of this," shouted Shinji. At his words, his AT-field shout outwards slightly, cracking the ground where Unit 01 stood. But he had to control his anger. If he let his angel half take over, nobody would be able to bring him back.  
"我说了让她别掺和进来，" 真嗣吼道。话音刚落，他的 AT 力场微微向外扩张，震裂了初号机脚下的地面。但他必须控制住自己的怒火。如果让他的天使半身掌控一切，就没人能把他拉回来了。

"Fine then," said Shinji, "you want to talk about my birth, fine, I'm listening."  
"好吧，" 真嗣说，"你想谈我的出生，行，我听着。"

"Oh? Don't tell me you aren't interested to know about how those two people met. I thought you would care after all this time."  
"哦？别告诉我你对那两个人是怎么相遇的不感兴趣。我以为经历了这么多，你会关心这些的。"

Shinji was silent, because he was unwilling to admit to her that she was right. Since he had learned that he was the child of Adam, he had wondered how his mom and Adam had met, but hadn't asked her the last time they had talked. But hearing it from Lilith was...  
真嗣沉默了，因为他不愿向她承认她说得对。自从得知自己是亚当的孩子后，他就一直在想母亲和亚当是如何相遇的，但上次谈话时并没有问她。但听莉莉丝说出来是……

"You also wanted to talk to me about my visions...correct?"  
“你也想和我谈谈我的预见……对吗？”

"More or less," said Lilith with a slight smirk. "So then am I to understand that you agree to this?"  
“或多或少吧，”莉莉丝微微一笑，“那么，我可以理解为你同意这件事了吗？”

Shinji thought about it again for a few seconds, but his curiousness won over his wariness and he nodded his head.  
真嗣又思考了几秒钟，但好奇心战胜了谨慎，他点了点头。

"Splendid," laughed Lilith. "Then in that case, why don't we get started. But, if you don't mind, I think I'm going to change into something a little more comfortable, to set the mood if you please."  
“太好了，”莉莉丝笑道，“那么，我们就开始吧。不过，如果你不介意的话，我想换件更舒适的衣物，来营造一下氛围，如果你愿意的话。”

Shinji was rather taken aback at this statement, not understanding it in the least.  
真嗣对这番话颇为惊讶，完全无法理解。

"What? I don't understand-"  
"什么？我不明白——"

But then he froze as he saw the facial features of Lilith change. The face that was Ayanami Rei was disappearing and was being replaced by a new face. The hair lengthened, the nose grew slightly longer, the cheekbones were more pronounced, the breasts even grew ever so slightly larger. But it was the change of the color of the eyes from blood red to ocean blue which made Shinji truly realize who he was starring at, and it was the eeriest thing he had ever witnessed.  
但随后他僵住了，因为他看到莉莉丝的面部特征发生了变化。那张原本是绫波零的脸正在消失，取而代之的是一张新面孔。头发变长了，鼻子略微变长，颧骨更加突出，胸部甚至略微变大。但真正让真嗣意识到他在注视着谁的是眼睛颜色的变化，从血红色变成了海洋般的蓝色，这是他所见过的最诡异的事情。

Smiling sinisterly, Lilith spoke back with a voice so similar to that of the real person, that Shinji was unsure what was fiction and what was real now.  
莉莉丝邪恶地笑着，用一种与真人如此相似的声音回话，以至于真嗣现在分不清什么是虚构，什么是现实。

"Long time no see. Baaaaka Shinji," said the Pseudo Asuka.  
“好久不见了，笨蛋真嗣。”伪明日香说道。

**So my new story called Christmas Together is obviously a Christmas special and is set five years after Third Impact is avoided, and no its not like Sorrowful Winter much more...fluffy I guess, and its been a while since I did a fluff so I figured I'd have fun with it. Also, I'm writing Shinji and Asuka in a setting which I've always wanted to try but haven't gotten around to it until now, but seeing as its Christmas, I figured its the perfect time. Anyways if you wanna check it out, head over to my profile, it should be up soon...  
所以我的新故事《一起过圣诞》显然是一部圣诞特辑，设定在第三次冲击被避免的五年后，而且它不像《悲伤的冬天》那样沉重，更多的是……温馨吧，毕竟我有一段时间没写过温馨的故事了，所以我想借此机会好好享受一下。另外，我正在写真嗣和明日香的故事，这个设定我一直想尝试但直到现在才有机会，既然是圣诞节，我觉得这是完美的时机。总之，如果你想看看的话，可以去我的个人主页，应该很快就会上线……**

### Chapter 32: Death

**Well...uhh..yeah...this chapter is kinda...well you know. And I stayed up all night working on this, so pardon if the grammar is a little bad.  
嗯...呃..是的...这一章有点...你知道的。我整晚都在写这个，所以如果语法有点糟糕，请见谅。**

---

"You...you-" mumbled Shinji as realization seemed to dawn on him. "You...every time and it was...you?"  
"你...你-" 真嗣喃喃自语，似乎恍然大悟。"你...每次都是...你？"

"What amazes me is that you never realized it," smiled the Lilith Asuka. "I even hinted at it many times. Hell, you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for me."  
"让我惊讶的是，你从未意识到这一点，"莉莉丝·明日香微笑道，"我甚至多次暗示过。见鬼，如果不是因为我，你甚至不会在这里。"

"But...even at the beginning-"  
"但……即使在最初——"

"Every time," smiled Lilith. "From the beginning, I was moving you like a piece on a chess board, shaping you into something I could use. And you have proved useful, what with that DNA and all, not to mention dispatching those annoying angels."  
"每一次，"莉莉丝微笑道，"从一开始，我就把你当作棋盘上的一枚棋子，塑造你成为我能利用的人。而你确实证明了自己的用处，凭借那 DNA 和所有，更不用说打发那些讨厌的天使了。"

"You used me!" shouted Shinji.  
“你利用了我！”真嗣喊道。

"True, but I only ever pointed you in the direction best suited for my goals, with a few minor errors. All in all, it was still your own decisions that shaped everything to this point. And I must say, your interaction with that little girl was loads better than what I had expected. If you had actually tried to repair her memory, well...things may have been a little different."  
“没错，但我只是引导你走向最适合我目标的方向，有些小错误。总的来说，还是你自己的决定塑造了这一切。而且我得说，你和那个小女孩的互动比我预想的要好得多。如果你真的试图修复她的记忆，那么……情况可能会有所不同。”

Shinji clenched Unit 01's fist and swung it at Lilith, but was met with such a strong AT-field, that the hand instantly snapped at the wrist when it hit the AT-field. Shinji screamed in pain as the wound was transferred to himself, breaking his wrist instantly.  
真嗣紧握初号机的拳头，向莉莉丝挥去，但遭遇了如此强大的 AT 力场，拳头一碰到 AT 力场，手腕就立刻断裂。真嗣痛苦地尖叫，伤口转移到了他自己身上，手腕瞬间骨折。

"I wouldn't do that," laughed Lilith as she looked down at Shinji. "My AT-field can't be penetrated by you, even if you do possess Adam's DNA."  
"我不会那么做的，"莉莉丝笑着低头看着真嗣。"我的 AT 力场你无法穿透，即便你拥有亚当的 DNA。"

"How are you able to maintain a complete form. Before...it was just your body."  
"你是如何保持完整形态的？之前...只是你的身体。"

"Idiot...my body was only half of it. My soul of course resided in Ayanami Rei, though I was able to freely move, which is why I appeared before you when I deemed it necessary. The Geofront and Tokyo-3 were built upon the Black Egg, and everything within its sphere I can influence. I am able to move freely, so long as it is within the boundaries of Tokyo-3."  
"傻瓜...我的身体只是其中一半。我的灵魂当然寄居在绫波零体内，尽管我能自由移动，这也是为什么我会在我认为必要的时候出现在你面前。第三新东京市和地底都市都是建在黑色巨卵之上，其影响范围内的万物我都能操控。只要在第三新东京市的范围内，我就能自由行动。"

Shinji snarled back at Lilith, but was suddenly hit from the side by one of the Eva Units, knocking the wind out of him. Quickly turning around, he just managed to dodge as another Lance of Longinus soared towards him. Sidestepping it, he swung around the Eva Units right side and brought the undamaged fist of Unit 01 up, attempting to crash it against the Eva Units jaw. His fist collided against an AT-field though, and judging by the instant shattering of the hand, Lilith had defended the Eva Unit.  
真嗣对着莉莉丝咆哮回去，但突然被一台 EVA 机体从侧面击中，让他喘不过气来。他迅速转身，勉强躲过另一支朗基努斯之枪。侧身避开，他绕到 EVA 机体的右侧，举起未受损的 01 号机拳头，试图猛击 EVA 机体的下巴。然而，他的拳头撞上了 AT 力场，从手部瞬间碎裂的情况来看，莉莉丝保护了 EVA 机体。

Pain seared into Shinji's left hand now as that wrist broke also. Both hands now had bones poking out at strange angles, the skin stretching over the bone.  
疼痛如火般灼烧着真嗣的左手腕，那里的骨头也断裂了。现在双手的骨头都以奇怪的角度突出，皮肤紧绷在骨头上。

"Damn it," Shinji swore. “该死，”真嗣咒骂道。

"Now that I have your full attention, lets get things underway...but first, we should get a few things out of the way that I'm sure you're dying to know."  
"既然我已经吸引了你们的全部注意力，让我们开始吧...但首先，我们应该解决一些你们肯定迫切想知道的事情。"

Lilith grinned widely and raised her arms up into the air. One by one, the twelve Eva Units rose into the air and made a circle like a crown above Lilith head and continued spinning around until they each came to a rest all at once.  
莉莉丝咧嘴大笑，双臂高举向空中。一个接一个，十二个 EVA 单元升空，在莉莉丝头顶上方形成一个圆圈，宛如一顶王冠，它们继续旋转，直到同时静止下来。

"The Eva Units," said Lilith, "I should be thankful that the old men did something to further my plans, though unknowingly. By having the DNA of Tabris, they each were able to grow a functioning S2 engine, and generate an AT-field. Instrumentality shall be achieved, but by my own designs, and the Tree of Life shall be thrown down and replaced by something befitting of my elegance. But I'm getting ahead of myself."  
"这些 EVA 单元，"莉莉丝说道，"我应该感谢那些老人们无意中推进了我的计划。通过拥有塔布里斯的 DNA，它们各自都能够生长出一个功能性的 S2 引擎，并生成 AT 力场。人类补完计划将会实现，但按照我自己的设计，生命之树将被推倒，取而代之的是更适合我优雅气质的东西。不过，我有点扯远了。"

Looking down at Shinji, Lilith raised her arms and said, "Everything of course began with myself and Adam, and everything will likely end with us. But humans and angels were thrown into the cycle of hatred between ourselves; you of course heard the gist of this from Tabris, who knew too much for his own good. But never did any of us think that Adam would bring life into this world by another means...meaning you of course."  
低头看着真嗣，莉莉丝抬起双臂说道：“一切当然始于我和亚当，而一切也很可能将随我们终结。但人类和天使却被卷入了我们之间的仇恨循环；你当然从塔布里斯那里听到了大概，他知道得太多，对自己并无益处。但我们从未想过亚当会以另一种方式将生命带入这个世界……当然，指的是你。”

Lilith smiled widely as Shinji had nothing to do but look up at his impending doom and listen to this.  
莉莉丝微笑着，真嗣除了抬头看着即将到来的厄运并聆听这一切外，别无他法。

Continuing, Lilith said, "After the humans were created, Adam did hide the White Moon. Scientists didn't find the White Moon in Antarctica as many speculate though, but of course they did find Adam. Second Impact...ahh how I remember it well. The contact experiment with Adam that was supposed to help birth new life, namely the Evangelions. That of course all went to shit quickly," laughed Lilith. "Adam went on a rampage, destroying much of this worlds ice caps, raising the sea levels so that almost every coastal city is now underwater. But this isn't anything new to you I'm sure...except for this one tiny new bit. The reason why Adam was at Antarctica in the first place, he was looking for your mother."  
莉莉丝继续说道，“在人类被创造之后，亚当隐藏了白月。尽管许多人猜测科学家在南极洲找到了白月，但实际上他们找到的是亚当。第二次冲击……啊，我至今记忆犹新。那本应是与亚当接触的实验，旨在孕育新的生命，即福音战士。当然，这一切很快就搞砸了，”莉莉丝笑道。“亚当发起狂来，摧毁了世界大部分的冰盖，海平面上升，几乎所有沿海城市都沉入了水下。不过，这对你们来说肯定不是什么新鲜事……除了这个小小的最新消息。亚当之所以在南极洲，是因为他在寻找你的母亲。”

Shinji blinked, unable to believe what he heard. Second Impact happened because Adam was searching for his mother? It just didn't make sense.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，无法相信自己听到的话。第二次冲击是因为亚当在寻找他的母亲？这根本说不通。

"But of course, this is still long ahead of were I should have started. Lets see...it would have been right before the turn of the century that your mom and Adam met. Now you have to understand, that there are large parts that I still don't know, and only Adam himself, or that hideous shape of your mother," Lilith gestured towards Unit 01, "would know anything about this." What I do know is, is that after a predetermined amount of time, Adam cloaked himself in the shape of a human, and walked among them for many years, watching as the century's came and went. Why he did this after expressing his loathing for your kind, I don't know. Maybe it was to come to an understanding about the beings he had helped create, or maybe he was just bitter, who knows. But eventually, Adam met your mother at a convention. At this point, the name he was using was Robert Klaus, a German scientist who had excellent credentials. Of course, him and your mother hit things off right away, much to the displeasure of Gendo, who was always overshadowed by not only your moms work, but now also by this new guy.  
当然，这还远在我本应开始的地方之前。让我们想想……那应该是世纪之交前夕，你妈妈和亚当相遇的时候。现在你必须明白，有很多部分我至今仍不清楚，只有亚当本人，或者你母亲那丑陋的形态，"莉莉丝指向初号机，"才知道这一切。我所知道的是，经过一段预设的时间后，亚当化身为人类形态，混迹于他们之中多年，见证了世纪的更迭。他为何在表达对你们种族的厌恶后这样做，我不清楚。也许是为了理解他所协助创造的生命，又或许他只是心怀怨恨，谁知道呢。但最终，亚当在一次会议上与你母亲相遇。那时他使用的名字是罗伯特·克劳斯，一位拥有卓越资历的德国科学家。当然，他和你的母亲一见如故，这让碇源堂颇为不快，他不仅一直被你母亲的工作所掩盖，现在又多了这个新对手。

They quickly started seeing each other from what I heard and saw, but there was never any word about marriage between them. Then of course something rather unexpected happened, and Yui, your mother found out that she was pregnant. I would have loved to see Adam's face when he heard the news...oh sorry...Robert.  
据我所知所见，他们很快就开始交往，但从未听说他们有结婚的打算。然后，当然发生了一些相当出乎意料的事情，你的母亲优，发现自己怀孕了。我真想看看亚当听到这个消息时的表情...哦，抱歉...是罗伯特。

They kept the news quiet for a few months though until Yui started to show, then they had to come out and announce it, though to a very small amount of people. Dr. Akagi, Dr. Soryu, and of course Gendo knew about it. Whether Fuyutsuki found out about it, I was never sure. Gendo or your mother may have told him.  
他们将这个消息保密了几个月，直到优开始显怀，才不得不公开宣布，不过只告诉了极少数人。赤木博士、苍龙博士，当然还有碇源堂知道这件事。至于冬月是否得知，我从未确定。可能是碇源堂或你的母亲告诉了他。

Now this is where things got complicated, because I've never known whether Adam had planned this or not, or if it just happened and he accepted it for what it was. But I believe that after experiencing thousands of years with humans, he was finally ready to settle down...maybe. The problem of course was the unborn child...you. You would have a portion of Adam himself in you, his DNA. I'm sure the thought of killing your unborn self crossed Adam's mind quite a few times, but he was truly in love with your mother. So he eventually tried to accept the role of a father, was even rather looking forward to it I suspect. But as the production of the Evangelions was reaching a turning point, and word of the backing organization known as Seele was starting to spread, he started voicing his opinions on the project.  
现在事情变得复杂了，因为我从未确定亚当是否计划了这一切，或者它只是偶然发生，而他接受了现实。但我认为，经历了与人类数千年的共处后，他终于准备好安定下来……或许吧。当然，问题在于那个未出生的孩子——你。你将拥有亚当的一部分，他的 DNA。我敢肯定，亚当多次考虑过杀死未出生的你，但他真的爱上了你的母亲。因此，他最终试图接受父亲的角色，甚至我猜他对此还颇为期待。但随着 EVA 的生产进入转折点，以及背后组织 Seele 的消息开始流传，他开始对项目发表意见。

It was of course something he had been brought into, because of the relationship him and your mother had, but he always knew that if worst came to worst, he would destroy the Evangelions before they got to the production phase. Thankfully that never happened, but he did try to sway them away from it. Your mother and the other scientists wouldn't hear it though, and were adamant that the Evangelions would spark the next stage in human evolution. He didn't have much of a choice then, and revealed who he truly was, though to your mother first.  
这当然是他因与你母亲的关系而被卷入的事情，但他始终明白，如果最坏的情况发生，他会在 EVA 进入生产阶段之前将其摧毁。幸运的是，这一幕从未上演，不过他的确试图劝阻他们。然而，你母亲和其他科学家对此充耳不闻，坚持认为 EVA 将引发人类进化的下一阶段。那时他别无选择，只能向你母亲首先揭示自己的真实身份。

She was, of course, immensely shocked and didn't believe him at first. But when he gave her a brief monologue of his long life, and in particular showed her his AT-field, which had only been a theory at the time, she had no choice but to believe him. She went to the others and spoke about it though, which he had wished at a time, but not so soon; Gendo and Dr. Akagi were very verbal about his presence at the facility. They treated him something of a spy, which he may have been. He was always spying on me, trying to learn what I was up to. He once caught a glimpse of my body at the lowest levels here at Nerv, but I never let that happen again.  
她自然是大为震惊，起初并不相信他。但当他简述了自己漫长的一生，并特别展示了当时仅停留在理论阶段的 AT 力场时，她不得不信。她随后向其他人透露了此事，虽然他曾希望她这么做，但不是那么快；碇源堂和赤木律子博士对他的出现反应激烈，视他为间谍，或许他确实如此。他一直在监视我，试图了解我的动向。他曾在 NERV 最底层瞥见我的真身，但我再未让此事发生。

After the reveal of who he truly was though, he knew that he wouldn't be able to stay with humans for much longer. So he had to make a choice about not only Yui, but their unborn child which they had yet to name. This was probably three months before Second Impact now. Well, after trying to persuade Yui away from the Evangelion project again, he gave up when she refused. He even tried telling her about me, which if she had believed, would have proven detrimental to my plans. The Evangelions were created with the help of the technology I let humans glimpse in the Black Moon, but Unit 01 in particular was born from part of my physical body.  
然而，在真相大白之后，他深知自己无法再长久地与人类共处。因此，他不得不做出抉择，不仅关乎 Yui，还有他们尚未命名的未出世的孩子。这大概是在第二次冲击发生前的三个月。在再次试图劝说 Yui 远离 EVA 项目无果后，他放弃了。他甚至尝试向我透露我的存在，如果她相信了，那将对我的计划极为不利。EVA 是在我让人类窥见的黑月科技帮助下制造的，尤其是初号机，它源自于我身体的一部分。

Right before Adam left though, Yui came to him and told him she had an ideal name for their child. Adam of course had never given it serious thought in the first place, and was already starting to forget about Yui at this point when she told him about your name. 'Shinji,' she told him. 'It means believe.' When Adam heard this, I don't think he understood the meaning behind the words, or the significance it may have. There was always that thought it the back of his mind about what you may have become, for certainly, you would have discovered your powers sooner or later.  
就在亚当离开之前，Yui 来找他，告诉他为他们的孩子想到了一个理想的名字。亚当当然从未认真考虑过这个问题，而且此时已经开始忘记 Yui，当她告诉他你的名字时。'真嗣，'她告诉他。'意思是相信。'当亚当听到这个名字时，我想他并不理解这些词背后的含义，或者它可能具有的重要性。他心中总有一个念头，关于你可能会成为什么，因为毫无疑问，你迟早会发现自己的力量。

When Adam finally did leave though, your mother was distraught over the whole thing. She had an unborn child, no father for the child, and to top it off, her fellow researchers were starting to gossip about her. News had traveled fast about her child and people were speculating about who the father might be, and many people pointed to Robert Klaus, because of his sudden disappearance. But somebody surprisingly stepped forward and claimed himself as the father of the child, meaning Gendo of course.  
当亚当最终离开时，你的母亲对整个事情感到极度沮丧。她有一个未出生的孩子，没有孩子的父亲，更糟糕的是，她的同事们开始议论她。关于她孩子的消息传得很快，人们都在猜测父亲可能是谁，许多人指向罗伯特·克劳斯，因为他的突然失踪。但出人意料的是，有人站出来声称自己是孩子的父亲，当然是指碇源堂。

He told Yui about a way to cover up the whole affair, by claiming that he was the father the entire time. At first, she did not want to listen to him, but eventually gave in. Maybe there was some lingering affection towards him from there college days, but I'm not so sure. I think she may have just been looking for a way out.  
他向唯提出一个掩盖整个事件的方法，声称自己一直都是孩子的父亲。起初，她并不想听他的，但最终还是妥协了。或许她对大学时期的他仍存有一丝眷恋，但我并不确定。我觉得她可能只是在寻找一个解脱的途径。

The only person that seemed very sympathetic towards her though was Dr. Soryu...who was of course expecting a daughter of her own very soon. She told Yui not to worry about the whole thing, and that at the success of the Evangelion project, everyone would forget about this little mishap. She was surprisingly right...  
唯一对她表现出极大同情的人是惣流博士……当然，她自己也即将迎来一个女儿。她告诉唯不必担心这件事，等到 EVA 计划成功，所有人都会忘记这个小插曲。她出奇地正确……

Now during the three months before Second Impact, I'm not so sure what happened to Adam. From what I had gathered, Robert Klaus's existence was wiped from the planet, and only those that knew him as Adam remembered him, so a very select few. I'm guessing though, that he reunited with his children, the angels, and told him that the approaching time was upon them.  
在第二次冲击前的三个月里，我不太确定亚当发生了什么。据我所知，罗伯特·克劳斯的存在的痕迹被从地球上抹去，只有那些知道他是亚当的人还记得他，这样的人非常少。我猜想，他可能与他的孩子们，即天使们重聚，并告诉他们即将到来的时刻。

Now this next part is just mere guess work, for I'm not sure what he was thinking a few days before Second Impact, but I believe that you were constantly on his mind. 'What would happen to him if he misused his powers? What if Seele got a hold of him? What if Lilith started manipulating him?' He was always wondering these things I believe during the last few days before Second Impact. I think that, the thought of still killing you may even have entered his mind, but I don't think it held sway there very long.  
接下来这部分纯属猜测，因为我并不确定他在第二次冲击前几天究竟在想什么，但我相信你一直萦绕在他心头。‘如果他滥用能力会怎样？如果 Seele 控制了他怎么办？如果莉莉丝开始操纵他呢？’我相信在第二次冲击前的最后几天，他一直在思考这些问题。我想，甚至可能有过杀掉你的念头，但我认为这个想法并未持续太久。

Now we come to the day of Second Impact, and how this event started a chain reaction leading to this moment in time. From what I was able to gather, Adam thought that your mother would be part of the team that was sent to investigate Antarctica, because they thought they found the White Moon of Adam, though what Adam had planned when he finally met your mother again, I don't know. I suspect that even he didn't know. But of course, your mother never was there, as she had gone into labor several hours before, and only Gendo was there briefly, until he heard the news about Yui. As to what actually happened on Antarctica...things are still sketchy.  
现在我们谈到了第二次冲击当天，以及这一事件如何引发连锁反应，导致此刻的时间节点。据我所知，亚当以为你的母亲会是派去南极调查的团队成员之一，因为他们认为找到了亚当的白月，尽管亚当再次见到你母亲时究竟有何计划，我不得而知。我怀疑他甚至自己也不清楚。但当然，你母亲并未出现在那里，因为她早在几小时前就进入了分娩状态，只有碇源堂短暂在场，直到他听到关于唯的消息。至于南极究竟发生了什么……情况依旧模糊不清。

The team of scientists found Adam encapsulated in ice, and there started to unthaw him. I have heard many different reports of how Second Impact was actually initiated, some of which included the fusing of mine and Adam's DNA, but they woke Adam up, and I believe his hatred for humans erupted then. He was always very in control of his thoughts and emotions, but I think the loss of Yui and you may have sent him over the edge. I wish I could have seen him in his agony," Lilith added bitterly.  
科学家团队在冰中发现了被封存的亚当，并开始解冻他。关于第二次冲击是如何真正引发的，我听过许多不同的报告，其中一些包括了我和亚当的 DNA 融合，但他们唤醒了亚当，我相信他对人类的仇恨就是在那时爆发的。他一直非常能控制自己的思想和情绪，但我想失去唯和你可能让他失去了理智。我真希望能看到他在痛苦中的样子。"莉莉丝苦涩地补充道。

"Adam awoke and destroyed everything he could, and his AT-field was said to split the oceans with one wave of his arm. The only person of course to survive his onslaught was Misato Katsuragi, thanks to her father of course. The aftermath of course you know of. Much of the worlds oceans turned red and the marine wildlife died. Odd that for someone who claimed he cared about the planet, Adam was very readily capable of damaging it."  
亚当醒来后摧毁了他能摧毁的一切，据说他的 AT 力场一挥手就能将海洋分开。当然，唯一幸免于他攻击的人是葛城美里，这多亏了她的父亲。当然，第二次冲击的后果你也知道。世界上的许多海洋变成了红色，海洋生物大量死亡。奇怪的是，尽管亚当声称他关心这个星球，他却非常轻易地就能破坏它。

Sighing lightly, Lilith looked up into the sky and mumbled, "Where Adam is right now though, I'm not sure. I expected him to show himself because of you, and everything that I've put you through. But he hasn't shown. Maybe he doesn't care what happens to you anymore."  
轻轻叹了口气，莉莉丝抬头望向天空，喃喃自语道：“不过，亚当现在在哪里，我不确定。我以为他会因为你，以及我让你经历的一切而现身。但他没有出现。也许他不再关心你的遭遇了。”

As Shinji looked up at Lilith though, he noticed something about her features, something that he hadn't seen yet before. She seemed worried.  
当真嗣抬头望向莉莉丝时，他注意到了她面容上的某些细节，那是他之前未曾见过的。她似乎显得忧心忡忡。

"But anyways," continued Lilith, "that ends the story of your mother and father I suppose, and how you came to be in this world. What comes after I'm sure you know of better than I would, since it is your childhood. Never seeing your mother, hardly seeing your father. I think that a part of your mother didn't want to see you, because it reminded her of Adam. But the plan that Gendo had devised worked out, and he became your supposed biological father.  
“但无论如何，”莉莉丝继续说道，“我想这便是你母亲和父亲的故事，以及你是如何来到这个世界的。之后的事情，你肯定比我更清楚，毕竟那是你的童年。从未见过你的母亲，几乎见不到你的父亲。我觉得你母亲的一部分并不想见你，因为这会让她想起亚当。但碇源堂的计划成功了，他成了你名义上的生物学父亲。

Your mother of course volunteered to be the subject during the activation of Unit 01, and thus became its soul. Maybe she knew that you would eventually become the pilot of it. Sometimes I even suspected that Adam's words about me held more sway that I had initially thought, because your mother became increasingly curious about my body buried under the Geofront.  
当然，你的母亲自愿成为初号机激活时的实验对象，从而成为了它的灵魂。也许她预知到你最终会成为它的驾驶员。有时我甚至怀疑亚当关于我的话比我想象的更有分量，因为你母亲对埋藏在 Geofront 下的我的身体越来越好奇。

After this, you slowly grew up to what you are today, closely watched by Gendo, and myself of course. Seele also started digging into the relationship between Gendo and Yui, and I believe that Dr. Akagi...that is Ritsuko, told them about her suspicions. I have no idea what she heard from her mother, but I'm sure it made her suspicious. Her mother was of course in love with Gendo as she is...or was? I'm not sure if she is still alive after all, but her mother also hated Yui because Gendo loved her so.  
自那以后，你逐渐成长为今天的模样，一直被碇源堂密切关注，当然还有我。Seele 也开始挖掘碇源堂和唯之间的关系，我相信赤木博士——也就是律子，向他们透露了她的疑虑。我不清楚她从母亲那里听到了什么，但我确信那让她产生了怀疑。她的母亲当然爱着碇源堂，就像她现在……或者曾经？我不确定她是否还活着，但她的母亲也憎恨唯，因为碇源堂深爱着她。

Lilith paused here for a second, wondering if Shinji had any questions, but his jaw was clenched tightly, unwilling to believe half of what he heard, though knowing deep in his heart that it was true.  
莉莉丝在这里停顿了一下，想知道真嗣是否有任何问题，但他的下巴紧绷，不愿相信所听到的半数内容，尽管内心深处知道那是真的。

"I can understand if much of what I said makes no sense to you whatsoever," said Lilith. "But I think its best you understand why you're here."  
“如果我说的很多事情对你来说毫无意义，我能理解，”莉莉丝说，“但我认为你最好明白你为何在这里。”

"...And you still haven't answered that," said Shinji suddenly speaking up. "Why did you choose me?"  
"...而你仍然没有回答这个问题，" 真嗣突然开口说道。"你为什么选择我？"

"I'm surprised I even have to answer that," laughed Lilith. "Its of course your unique power that was gifted to you by Adam. Each angel of course was given a certain amount of power based on their government of the Tree of Life. Tabris, as being the strongest, was given the strongest power of sight, but it was only with relevance to his death, meaning that he could see everything until he died. Afterwards, he was none the wiser."  
"我甚至惊讶于我必须回答这个问题，" 莉莉丝笑着说。"当然是因为亚当赋予你的独特力量。每个天使根据他们对生命之树的统治程度被赋予了一定量的力量。塔布里斯作为最强的天使，被赋予了最强的预见力，但这仅限于他死亡之前，意味着他能看到一切直到他死去。之后，他就一无所知了。"

"Then what of my visions? You're the one that explained them in part to me, but before you said that I wasn't quite right in my assumption that I was able to govern time, and in particular, a persons time."  
"那么我的那些幻象呢？是你部分向我解释了它们，但之前你说我并不完全正确地认为我能掌控时间，特别是某个人的时间。"

"I did, and I still say that, because that is only a part of your power. You hold Adam's DNA within you, something that only you as a human who was born because of him can control. Gendo tried this and discovered that he only received a very weak AT-field.  
"我确实这么说过，而且我仍然坚持，因为那只是你力量的一部分。你体内拥有亚当的 DNA，这是只有你这样因他而生的人类才能控制的。碇源堂也曾尝试过，但他只得到了一个非常微弱的 AT 力场。"

Adam is a unique being such as myself, and we both have unique powers, some of which we share, but Adam's was always...different. He was able to shape things, and even in his human form people. He had a certain knack for changing the lives of people, and in certain cases, shaping human history itself."  
亚当是一个像我一样的独特存在，我们都拥有独特的力量，其中一些我们共享，但亚当的总是...与众不同。他能够塑造事物，甚至在人类形态下也能影响人们。他有一种改变人们生活的天赋，在某些情况下，甚至能塑造人类历史本身。

"So what does that mean to me?"  
"那对我来说意味着什么？"

Lilith sighed, clearly annoyed that he was not getting it.  
莉莉丝叹了口气，显然对他不开窍感到恼火。

"Alright...you're visions show the possible futures within a person. What they are capable of, what they are not capable of, how they may die, and many other things. But based on what you yourself are doing at the time, the visions change. If you don't interact with someone, they may prosper simply by not knowing you, or, they may die. You can see this of course, and then can chose what you what to do based on that information.  
“好吧……你的幻象展示了一个人可能的未来。他们的能力，他们的无能，他们可能的死亡方式，以及许多其他事情。但根据你当时自己的行为，幻象会发生变化。如果你不与某人互动，他们可能会因为不认识你而繁荣，或者，他们可能会死去。你当然能看到这些，然后可以根据这些信息选择你想做的事情。”

This you already know, but its more so then that. Did you ever think of the other people involved with this person's life that you are affecting? Take for instance the president of some foreign country. Say he has a daughter...you fuck this daughter, and run away with her because she gets pregnant. The families entire reputation is ruined because of this action of you thrusting your dick inside of her. A coup d'état ensues and the entire country is thrust into civil war. Bordering countries are eventually brought into the countries war because of friendly fire and eventually we have started World War III. Now lets take it one step further...say that the larger countries get involved, and it sparks off a nuclear conflict. We have a nuclear holocaust, a never ending winter, and seventy percent of the human dies because of the fallout, all because you couldn't keeping your pants on."  
这些你已经知道，但不仅如此。你有没有想过，这个人的生活中还有其他被你影响的人？比如某个外国国家的总统。假设他有个女儿……你和她上床，然后因为她怀孕而带着她逃跑。这个家庭的整个声誉因你插入她的行为而毁于一旦。一场政变随之而来，整个国家陷入内战。邻国最终因友军误伤而被卷入战争，最终我们引发了第三次世界大战。现在让我们再进一步……假设大国介入，引发了一场核冲突。我们面临核灾难，无尽的寒冬，以及因辐射而死亡的百分之七十的人类，这一切都因为你无法控制自己的下半身。

Lilith finished this long monologue and was staring down at Shinji. She was no longer smiling.  
莉莉丝结束了这段冗长的独白，低头凝视着真嗣。她不再微笑。

"This may be just an example, but things like this can happen, take World War I. An Archduke is assassinated by someone from a foreign country. Tensions mount and eventually the world is thrust into war. You have to think of the whole picture when you make decisions.  
这或许只是一个例子，但类似的事情确实可能发生，比如第一次世界大战。一位大公被来自外国的某人暗杀，紧张局势随之升级，最终将世界卷入战争。在做出决策时，你必须考虑全局。

Your power, is not so much the control of time, but the control of people. If you haven't noticed yet, you have a certain...air about you which people seem to latch onto. They want to know you, because they know that you're somebody who will help them. Its almost like a charismatic thing. If you ever rose to the power of a dictator, then the world would have to bow down before you. You would see everything, know everything, and people would be afraid of you.  
你的力量，并非主要在于控制时间，而是控制人心。如果你还没注意到，你身上有一种...气质，让人们不由自主地靠近。他们想了解你，因为他们知道你会帮助他们。这几乎是一种魅力。如果你有朝一日成为独裁者，那么世界将不得不向你低头。你将洞察一切，知晓一切，人们会对你心生畏惧。

Adam has the ability to see everyone all at once in the world, which is odd because he despised humans. The very thought of being able to see into the minds of the tens of billions of humans on this planet must have tormented him. You yourself have this, to a certain extent. You haven't gained it yet though, and this is in part because you hate people. Adam loved the angels and hated the humans, but they were still partly created by him, so he begrudgingly accepted that they were part of his creation.  
亚当拥有同时看到世界上每个人的能力，这很奇怪，因为他鄙视人类。一想到能够窥视地球上数千亿人类的内心，这念头必定让他痛苦不堪。你自己也一定程度上拥有这种能力。尽管你尚未获得它，部分原因在于你厌恶人类。亚当爱天使而恨人类，但他们毕竟部分由他所创造，因此他勉强接受他们是自己创造的一部分。

That is the other side of the coin, and I'm sure you may have realized it yourself. Love is a strong governing factor in these visions, which is why you are more attuned to that girl. People you have met, care for, or hold strong affection for are always easier to see then people you see on the street. You have glimpsed brief flashes of things, but you never took much notice to it. But imagine standing on a side walk with twenty other people, and being assaulted by visions from everyone of them. It could be as simple as what they'll have for dinner, or an item they've been thinking of buying. But you also know that there are other things, such as murder, stealing, and rape. You may encounter this during one of these experiences, and you can decide whether to confront this person, kill him or not. But it will always affect a third party."  
那是硬币的另一面，我相信你自己也可能意识到了。爱是这些幻象中的强大支配因素，这就是为什么你对那个女孩更加敏感。你遇到过、关心过或深爱的人总是比你在街上看到的人更容易看到。你曾瞥见过一些短暂的闪现，但你从未过多关注。但想象一下，站在人行道上，周围有二十个人，被他们每个人的幻象所冲击。可能简单到他们晚餐吃什么，或者他们一直在考虑购买的物品。但你也知道还有其他事情，比如谋杀、偷窃和强奸。你可能会在这些经历中遇到这种情况，你可以决定是否面对这个人，是否杀了他。但这总会影响到第三方。

Lilith was silent now as she waited for Shinji's reaction to the whole thing.  
莉莉丝现在沉默了，她等待着真嗣对这一切的反应。

"...So its...control?" “……所以这是……控制？”

"Mainly," said Lilith. "People with a strong connection to you may influence you in return, but you normally stay who you are, while changing the people around you. In fact, that girl is probably the only person that could influence you to do anything, whether it benefits you or not."  
“主要是，”莉莉丝说，“与你有着强烈联系的人可能会反过来影响你，但你通常还是保持自我，同时改变周围的人。事实上，那个女孩可能是唯一能影响你做任何事的人，无论这件事对你是否有利。”

Shinji was silent for a minute until he said, "You still haven't said what you needed me for."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后说：“你还没说你需要我做什么。”

"You still don't know?" mumbled Lilith. "Well...to put it bluntly, you will be the spark of my version of Instrumentality. As an imperfect being, born from that of a human and the unique being known as Adam, you will be a mold so that I can reshape the world as I see fit."  
“你还是不知道吗？”莉莉丝咕哝道，“好吧……直截了当地说，你将成为我版本的人类补完计划的引子。作为一个不完美的存在，由人类和被称为亚当的独特存在所生，你将成为一个模具，让我能按照自己的意愿重塑世界。”

"So I'm just a tool?" said Shinji bitterly.  
“所以我只是个工具吗？”真嗣苦涩地说道。

"If you want to look at it that way...sure. You're a to-"  
“如果你非要这么看……没错。你是个工……”

Shinji suddenly lashed out upwards towards Lilith with Unit 01's AT-field, the wrists finally regenerating. Lilith blocked however while barely bating an eyelash. But as she looked back down at the place where Shinji had been, she saw that he was not there.  
真嗣突然操控初号机用 AT 力场向上攻击莉莉丝，手腕终于再生完毕。莉莉丝虽然挡住了攻击，却几乎没眨眼。但当她低头再看真嗣所在的地方时，却发现他已经不在那里了。

"So its a game of cat and mouse?" smiled Lilith.  
"这么说这是一场猫捉老鼠的游戏？"莉莉丝微笑着说。

Shinji meanwhile, was hiding behind a broken building and catching her breath. What he had done was extremely risky, but he had been waiting for the right moment. He didn't care what Lilith told him, as long as it kept her busy while he waited for his arm to repair itself, but it had taken longer than he had expected. But thats not to say he didn't gather any useful information from her. What she said about his mother and Adam...well, he didn't want to think about it, but a lot of what she said made sense. And his visions...well that was all a convoluted mess now. He didn't know what was true and what wasn't anymore.  
与此同时，真嗣躲在一座破败的建筑后面，喘着气。他所做的一切极其冒险，但他一直在等待合适的时机。无论莉莉丝告诉他什么，只要能让她分心，让他有时间等待手臂自我修复，他都不在乎，但这比他预期的要长。但这并不意味着他没有从她那里得到任何有用的信息。她关于他母亲和亚当的话...好吧，他不想去想，但她说的很多话都很有道理。至于他的幻觉...现在完全是一团乱麻。他不知道什么是真的，什么不是。

"But I still need to find a way to stop her," mumbled Shinji as he looked down at his feet. Trouble was, he didn't know how he was supposed to do that. Could he let himself be captured and then trick Lilith when she tried to institute Instrumentality? Shinji didn't think that would work...Lilith wasn't stupid.  
"但我仍然需要找到阻止她的方法，"真嗣低头看着自己的脚喃喃自语。问题是，他不知道该怎么做。他能否让自己被捕，然后在莉莉丝试图实施人类补完计划时欺骗她？真嗣认为那不会奏效...莉莉丝并不愚蠢。

"What the fuck am I suppose to do," mumbled Shinji.  
“我他妈该怎么办，”真嗣咕哝道。

But before he had a chance to think, he dove forwards as a Lance of Longinus pierced through the building he had been crouching behind. Looking around the corner of the building, was of course one of the Eva Units.  
但还没等他来得及思考，他就向前一跃，一根朗基努斯之枪穿透了他之前蹲伏的建筑。他绕到建筑的拐角处，果然看到了一台 EVA 机体。

'Not these again,' thought Shinji.  
“又是这些家伙，”真嗣心想。

Diving backwards, Shinji dodged the Eva Unit as it thrust the lance towards him. Slicing Unit 01's arm upwards, Shinji cut into the soft tissue of the Eva Units chest cavity. It immediately broke open, spilling blood and organs on the ground.  
向后一跃，真嗣躲开了 EVA 初号机刺来的长矛。他挥刀向上斩去，切入了 EVA 初号机的胸腔软组织。胸腔立刻破裂，鲜血和内脏洒落一地。

Pausing briefly, Shinji then felt a strong AT-field to his right, and jumped backwards just as Lilith's arm came crash down at the spot he had been seconds before. The ground split where her arm had been, but next second, Shinji saw her other arm came swinging down and knew what was coming. An AT-field erupted forth from Lilith, splitting the ground and making it look as though a knife had cut it.  
真嗣短暂停顿，随即感受到右侧一股强大的 AT 力场，他迅速后跳，就在他刚刚所在的位置，莉莉丝的手臂轰然落下。地面在她手臂落下的地方裂开，但下一秒，真嗣看到她的另一只手臂挥舞而下，预感到了即将发生的事情。莉莉丝的 AT 力场爆发，地面被撕裂，仿佛被利刃切割一般。

Skidding backwards, Shinji felt movement behind him and turned around to see three Eva Units waiting for him, each holding a Lance of Longinus. Forcing Unit 01 to jump high into the air, Shinji soared over the Eva Units and landed directly behind them. Swinging Unit 01's legs out, he caught them off guard and kick there feet out from under them. Take control of this situation, Unit 01 brought both its arms up, and brought its fists crashing down into the skulls of two of the Eva Units. The skulls yielded almost instantly, creating a crater in the middle of the head. Turning towards the other Unit, which had just started getting up, Unit 01 brought its arm down horizontally, creating a diagonal slash across its chest. As the Eva Unit toppled backwards though, Shinji saw Lilith rushing towards him, and with a quick flash of orange new that she had sent her AT-field after him.  
滑行后退中，真嗣感觉到身后有动静，转身一看，三台 EVA 正等待着他，每台都手持朗基努斯之枪。真嗣操控初号机高高跃起，越过 EVA 群，稳稳落在它们身后。他迅速踢出初号机的双腿，出其不意地击倒它们。掌控局势的初号机双臂上扬，猛击其中两台 EVA 的头颅，头骨瞬间凹陷，形成一个中央的坑洞。转向另一台刚站起的 EVA，初号机横向挥臂，在其胸前划出一道斜线。然而，当这台 EVA 向后倒下时，真嗣瞥见莉莉丝正向他冲来，一抹橙光闪过，他知道她的 AT 力场已经袭来。

Diving out of the way, Unit 01 rolled as Lilith went rushing past him. For such a large body, she was quite quick. Standing up, Shinji looked over at Lilith, and saw that she was walking towards him. Her face still adorned with Asuka's features.  
闪避跳开，初号机翻滚着躲过了莉莉丝的冲撞。尽管身躯庞大，她的速度却异常迅捷。站起身来，真嗣望向莉莉丝，见她正向他走来，脸上依旧保留着明日香的特征。

"There isn't any use running away Shinji," whispered Lilith. "It'll only be a matter of time before I catch you...and don't even try thinking of a plan, because it wont work."  
"逃跑是没有用的，真嗣，" 莉莉丝低声说道。"我迟早会抓到你的...而且别费心思去想什么计划了，因为那不会奏效。"

Shinji snarled back at her, and projecting Unit 01's AT-field towards her, which she calmly brushed aside with a wave of her hand.  
真嗣对她咆哮着，试图用初号机的 AT 力场攻击她，但她只是轻轻一挥手就将其化解了。

"When are you going to learn that the Evangelions can possibly hope to match us. They were created because of me after."  
"你什么时候才能明白，使徒们根本不可能与我们匹敌。他们是因为我而诞生的。"

Throwing her own AT-field at him, Shinji skillfully dodged, but was suddenly met with sharp pain in his right leg. Looking down at it, he saw a large gash in that was steadily pouring out blood. Looking at Unit 01's own leg, he saw what happened. The Eva Unit that he had slashed earlier with his AT-field had grabbed a nearby lance and plunged it into Unit 01's leg. Though it seemed rather shallow, it still wouldn't heal..  
她将自己的 AT 力场投向他，真嗣灵巧地躲闪，却突然感到右腿一阵剧痛。低头一看，只见一道深深的伤口正不断涌出鲜血。他看向初号机的腿部，明白了发生了什么。之前被他用 AT 力场砍伤的 EVA 机体，抓起附近的长矛，猛地刺入了初号机的腿中。虽然看似不深，但伤口却无法愈合。

Now with a permanently wounded arm, and leg, Shinji was starting to become weary from the battle, and Lilith was keen to capitalize on this.  
如今手臂和腿部都受了永久性伤害，真嗣开始因战斗而感到疲惫，而莉莉丝则敏锐地抓住了这个机会。

"Why are you being so stubborn about this Shinji? You of all people should realize how wonderful Instrumentality will be. Nobody to shun you, nobody to hurt you, everything will be remade, and you have the power to decide how that will happen, with a few pointers from me," grinned Lilith.  
“为什么你这么固执呢，真嗣？你最应该明白补完计划是多么美妙。没有人会排斥你，没有人会伤害你，一切都将被重塑，而你有能力决定这一切如何发生，只需我稍加指点，”莉莉丝笑着说。

Shinji grimaced back at her, unable to speak of the pain that was searing through his right leg.  
真嗣对她苦笑了一下，无法说出右腿上灼烧般的疼痛。

"Still being stubborn I suppose, guess that redhead rubbed off on you a little. Well we can fix that."  
“还是那么固执，我想那个红发女孩多少影响了你一点。不过我们可以解决这个问题。”

Next second, several Eva Units appeared from the sides of Unit 01 and rushed at him. As Shinji saw this, he tried standing up, but the pain in his leg was hurting him too much. All at once, the Eva Units jump on top of him, bitting into the neck of Unit 01. Blood instantly poured forth from several spots in Shinji's own neck. It appeared that his carotid artery had been bitten. Inside Unit 01, the LCL fluid turned such a dark red that painted looked as though it had been spilled in there. Shinji was floating in a sea of his own blood. His vision was beginning to grow hazy now, but he could still hear Lilith's voice.  
下一秒，几台 EVA 从初号机两侧出现，向他冲来。真嗣看到这一幕，试图站起来，但腿上的疼痛让他难以忍受。突然间，EVA 们扑到他身上，咬住了初号机的脖子。鲜血立刻从真嗣自己的脖子上几个地方涌出。看来他的颈动脉被咬破了。在初号机内部，LCL 液体变得如此深红，仿佛里面泼满了鲜血。真嗣漂浮在自己的血海中。他的视线开始变得模糊，但他仍能听到莉莉丝的声音。

"I think that was a bit much maybe, don't want you to die after all. Well, I got time I guess. Maybe I'll go play with that redhead a bit."  
"我觉得那可能有点过头了，毕竟不想让你死掉。嗯，我还有时间，或许该去找那个红发家伙玩玩。"

At Lilith's words, the pressure in Unit 01 changed. The density of the LCL fluid increased, mixing with Shinji's blood that held trace amounts of Adam's DNA. Though the blood continued pouring forth from Shinji's next, the LCL fluid kept him awake and alive.  
听到莉莉丝的话，初号机内的压力发生了变化。LCL 液体的密度增加，混入了真嗣血液中微量的亚当 DNA。尽管血液继续从真嗣的伤口涌出，LCL 液体却让他保持清醒和生命力。

The bindings on Unit 01 suddenly broke off and fell to the ground, revealing the grey tissue underneath. Unit 01 then let out a roar, that almost drove the Eva Units to there knees. Even Lilith was rather surprised at this sudden chance.  
初号机上的束缚突然断裂，掉落在地，露出了下面的灰色组织。初号机随即发出一声咆哮，几乎让其他 EVA 机体屈膝。就连莉莉丝也对这突如其来的变化感到相当惊讶。

'Did his angel side finally take over? Or is it simply because of that girl?'  
“是他的天使一面终于占据了上风？还是仅仅因为那个女孩？”

Unit 01 then kicked off against the ground, cracking it in place. Rushing towards Lilith, Unit 01 brought its fist back and thrust it against Lilith. Smirking slightly Lilith project her AT-field by throwing her palm outwards, but next second, she her grin faltered. The sheer hate and loathing radiating from Shinji was stifling that Lilith momentarily forgot that Shinji was merely a human. She hadn't felt hate this strong since she had last met Adam.  
初号机随即猛蹬地面，将其踏裂。它冲向莉莉丝，收回拳头，猛击过去。莉莉丝微微一笑，伸出掌心展开 AT 力场，但下一秒，她的笑容僵住了。真嗣散发出的纯粹仇恨与厌恶如此强烈，让莉莉丝一时忘记了真嗣只是个人类。自上次遇见亚当以来，她未曾感受过如此强烈的恨意。

"Bastard," swore Lilith as she pushed Unit 01 backwards. But as Shinji went reeling backwards, he charged at Lilith again, all sign of intelligence gone. He was nothing more than an animal now.  
“混蛋，”莉莉丝咒骂着将初号机推开。但当真嗣踉跄后退时，他又再次冲向莉莉丝，理智荡然无存。此刻的他，不过是一头野兽。

"Does that girl really mean so much to you that you would bring yourself down to this level?" shouted Lilith as she fended off Unit 01.  
“那个女孩对你真的那么重要，以至于你要自降身份到这种地步？”莉莉丝一边抵挡着 01 号机一边喊道。

Shinji couldn't hear anything though, only the pounding of blood in his ear drums as he repeatedly repeated to Unit 01...kill. A rage seemed to have overcome himself, such that he had never felt before. Not even when he was pounding that rapist into a bloody pulp had he felt so much anger. Lilith was the enemy of all things living, and she deserved to be destroyed. Her soul ripped from the Black Moon which it resided in. Her body torn asunder by Unit 01's teeth and left to rot out in the scorching sun.  
但真嗣什么也听不见，只有耳膜中血液的轰鸣声，他不断向 01 号机重复着...杀。一种前所未有的愤怒似乎控制了他。甚至在他将那个强奸犯打得血肉模糊时，他也没有感到如此强烈的愤怒。莉莉丝是所有生灵的敌人，她理应被毁灭。她的灵魂从她所居住的黑月中被撕裂。她的身体被 01 号机的利齿撕碎，任由其在烈日下腐烂。

'Everything is her fault,' thought Shinji hatefully.  
“一切都是她的错，”真嗣恨恨地想。

Suddenly stopping his continued onslaught, Shinji dove backwards and stood in front of Lilith for a minute before he extended Unit 01's left arm palm outwards.  
突然停止了连续的攻击，真嗣向后一跃，站在莉莉丝前片刻，然后伸出了初号机左手的掌心向外。

"How many times do I have to tell you, that an Evangelions AT-field will not work on me."  
“我得告诉你多少次，使徒的 AT 力场对我不起作用。”

"Then how about an AT-field akin to your own," said Shinji in voice completely different from his own.  
“那么，类似于你自己的 AT 力场如何？”真嗣用一种完全不同于他自己的声音说道。

Lilith blinked at these words, thinking that she had misheard, but she had not. Shinji's own AT-field erupted suddenly, splitting the earth just as Lilith's had done. Moving faster than the speed of sound, Lilith quickly protected herself by creating a sphere around herself by using her AT-field. Shinji's crashed into hers, destroying much of the ground around Lilith. Dust and debris flew in all direction, as the explosion happened, shaking the earth as it happened. Earthquakes and tsunamis exploded across all of the earth as the two clashed against each other.  
莉莉丝听到这些话时眨了眨眼，以为自己听错了，但她并没有。真嗣自己的 AT 力场突然爆发，像莉莉丝之前那样撕裂了大地。莉莉丝以超音速移动，迅速用她的 AT 力场创造出一个球体保护自己。真嗣的力场撞击到她的，摧毁了莉莉丝周围的大片地面。尘埃和碎片四处飞散，爆炸发生时，大地为之震动。地震和海啸在全球范围内爆发，两者之间的冲突愈演愈烈。

"Adam...you bastard," swore Lilith. "Even at the end of everything, you still try to interfere."  
亚当……你这个混蛋，"莉莉丝咒骂道，"即便在一切的尽头，你仍试图干涉。

Shinji was panting heavily however, and even with the help from Adam's DNA, he was still barely able to hold his own against Lilith.  
然而，真嗣喘息得厉害，即便有亚当 DNA 的帮助，他仍然勉强才能与莉莉丝抗衡。

"What? Is that all you really got?" Came a voice inside Unit 01.  
"什么？你就这点本事吗？" 初号机内传来一个声音。

Shinji thought that he was going insane, but then remembered the voice.  
真嗣以为自己疯了，但随即想起了那个声音。

"Are you going to help me or not?" asked Shinji, "though I'm sure what you could actually do to help."  
"你到底帮不帮我？" 真嗣问道，"虽然我不确定你能有什么实际的帮助。"

The voice was silent for a minute until it muttered, "Lilith..." But from the sound of the voice, it knew about Lilith, and Shinji picked up on this.  
那声音沉默了一会儿，然后低声说道：“莉莉丝……”但从声音的语调中，它显然知道莉莉丝，这让真嗣察觉到了这一点。

"You know about Lilith?" “你知道莉莉丝？”

"We've met," murmured the voice.  
“我们见过，”那声音轻声说道。

"So then do you have any ideas on how we're supposed to beat her?"  
"那么，你有什么想法我们该怎么打败她吗？"

"We? Didn't know it had come to that, though I don't know what I can do admittedly. My influence doesn't help you nearly as much as it used to."  
"我们？没想到已经到了这一步，不过说实话，我不知道我能帮上什么忙。我的影响力已经不像以前那样对你有帮助了。"

"Why?" “为什么？”

"Because the awakening of your angel self gave you everything that I was already capable of giving you."  
"因为你的天使自我觉醒后，你已经拥有了原本我所能给予你的一切。"

Shinji was silent as he heard this statement, unwilling to believe what this possibly meant.  
听到这句话，真嗣沉默了，不愿相信这可能意味着什么。

"You'll do fine I'm sure, and if not...well, that girl...Asuka was her name? I'm sure she'll help you out."  
“我相信你会做得很好的，如果不行的话……那个女孩，叫明日香对吧？我相信她会帮你的。”

Shinji opened his mouth to say something but realized it didn't matter either way...and he wasn't sure if he wanted to know the answer anyway.  
真嗣张嘴想说些什么，但随即意识到这无关紧要……而且他也不确定自己是否真的想知道答案。

"So I'm on my own then?"  
"这么说，我就得一个人了？"

"You're never truly on your own Shinji...you have someone that cares for you, and that you care for in return. That is something Lilith doesn't have, nor will ever have."  
"你永远不会真正孤单的，真嗣...你有关心你的人，也有你关心的人。这是莉莉丝所没有的，也永远不会有的。"

"I guess a thanks is in order," said Shinji. "You helped me when I didn't know what to do..."  
"我想是该说声谢谢，" 真嗣说道。"在我不知道该怎么办的时候，你帮了我..."

"Don't be stupid, it was always possible to begin with. It just took time was all."  
"别犯傻了，这从一开始就是可能的。只是需要时间罢了。"

"Then I guess I wont be talking to you again..."  
"那我想我不会再和你说话了……"

"Nope, not very likely." "没错，不太可能了。"

"Can you answer one thing though?"  
"不过你能回答一件事吗？"

"...I'll try..." "...我试试..."

"Are you real? Or has this all been in my mind...your voice?"  
"你是真实的吗？还是这一切都只是我的想象...你的声音？"

"No clue. It may be your mind, this Eva Unit, or even your mothers soul that is speaking to you. Does it really matter?"  
"毫无头绪。可能是你的意识、这台 EVA 机体，甚至是你的母亲的灵魂在对你说话。真的重要吗？"

"No, not really..." "不，确实不重要……"

"Good...well I'm leaving. And Lilith..." but the voice trailed off, unsure what its supposed to say about that particular matter.  
""好……那我走了。还有莉莉丝……"" 但声音渐渐消失，不确定该如何提及那个特定的问题。

"Bye," mumbled Shinji, into the empty entry plug of Unit 01. Almost instantly, his mind went back to normal, no longer the hatred he had for Lilith moments before lingered. But something else was there, and he yearned for it.  
“再见。”真嗣喃喃道，对着初号机空荡荡的插入栓。几乎立刻，他的思绪恢复了正常，之前对莉莉丝的憎恨已不复存在。但有些东西留了下来，他渴望着它。

"Asuka...where are you?" he mumbled.  
“明日香……你在哪儿？”他低声自语。

He knew he had told her to run away, but he still had a nagging suspicion in the back of his head that she hadn't quite listened to him. Most likely, she was far enough away to not get caught in the battle, but still able to see him.  
他知道自己让她逃走，但内心深处仍有一丝不安，怀疑她并未完全听从他的话。很可能，她已经远离到不会被战斗波及，但仍能看见他。

As he brought up the intercom though, he didn't see a signal be broadcasted from Unit 02. Everything was blank.  
然而，当他打开对讲机时，却没有看到从二号机发出的信号。一切都是空白的。

'Then there's always,' thought Shinji. If what he had done earlier to get her attention had worked before, then what about trying it on a much larger scale.  
“那么总有办法，”真嗣心想。如果他之前为了引起她注意所做的事情曾经奏效，那么这次何不尝试更大规模的行动。

'Its worth a try,' he thought. But he had other things to worry about at the moment, as Lilith came rushing towards him. Backing off, Shinji winced as pain seared through his right leg. No longer under the stimulating effects of Adam's DNA, the pain was back, and the weariness. If he didn't find Asuka soon, he'd be in trouble.  
“值得一试，”他想着。但此刻他还有其他事情要担心，因为莉莉丝正向他冲来。真嗣后退着，右腿的剧痛让他皱眉。不再受亚当 DNA 的刺激影响，疼痛和疲惫感再次袭来。如果他不能尽快找到明日香，麻烦就大了。

'Odd how I end up relying on her in the end,' smiled Shinji.  
“奇怪的是，最终我还是依赖她，”真嗣微笑道。

Regaining his balance, he rushed in the opposite direction of Lilith where there were plenty of buildings to take cover behind. If he could just buy a minutes time, then he would be able to find Asuka.  
他重新站稳，朝着莉莉丝相反的方向冲去，那里有许多建筑物可以掩护。只要他能争取到一分钟的时间，就能找到明日香。

Zigzagging through residential districts, Shinji suddenly remembered an Nerv emergency access point used when the Eva Units needed be moved. He just hoped that it hadn't been destroyed.  
穿梭于住宅区之间，真嗣突然想起了一个 NERV 的紧急通道，那是当 EVA 单位需要移动时使用的。他只希望那个通道没有被摧毁。

Finding it quicker than he had expected, it was still intact with a few minor pieces of rubble covering. Moving it easily with Unit 01, Shinji quickly slashed the hatch open with Unit 01's AT-field, and dove down into it, gripping onto the metal side so that he wouldn't slide down the long elevator shaft.  
发现这比他预期的要快，它仍然完好无损，只有几块小碎石覆盖。借助初号机的力量轻松移开，真嗣迅速用初号机的 AT 力场劈开舱门，紧握金属边缘，以免沿着长长的电梯井滑落。

Gathering his thoughts, he thought of Asuka and only Asuka, projecting his feelings towards her in his thoughts and sent his AT-field out in the open sky. Lilith instantly picked him up though, and knowing what he was trying to do, smiled slightly and thought-  
他集中思绪，只想着明日香，将他对她的感情投射在思绪中，并向广阔的天空释放出自己的 AT 力场。莉莉丝立刻察觉到了他，知道他试图做什么，微微一笑，心想——

'This should prove interesting.'  
'这应该会很有趣。'

For the moment, she would wait.  
此刻，她只能等待。

---

As Shinji had predicted Asuka hadn't listened to him, but done exactly what he figured. She was on a bluff overlooking Tokyo-3 and was able to see the entirety of the battle. When Shinji had been stabbed by the second Lance of Longinus, she had been particularly fearful, and almost rushed down to the battlefield to help him. But she knew that she would only be interfering. Something had happened to him afterwards. For a while, it seemed that he was on par with Lilith, and she had wondered if his angel self had finally taken over, as horrible as that sounded to her. Now though, Shinji was nowhere to be seen. He had dashed into the destroyed city of Tokyo-3 and she hadn't been able to see him. She was even starting to contemplate of moving positions...or even going down there to search for him.  
正如真嗣所预料，明日香并未听从他的话，而是完全按照他的猜测行事。她站在一处悬崖上，俯瞰着第三新东京市，能将整个战场尽收眼底。当真嗣被第二支朗基努斯之枪刺中时，她尤为恐惧，几乎要冲下战场去帮助他。但她明白，那样只会添乱。之后，真嗣身上发生了某种变化。有一段时间，他似乎与莉莉丝不相上下，她不禁怀疑他的天使自我是否终于占据了主导，尽管这想法让她感到可怕。然而现在，真嗣已不见踪影。他冲进了被毁的第三新东京市，而她无法看到他。她甚至开始考虑换个位置……或者干脆下去寻找他。

"Shinji...where did you go?" she mumbled into the empty entry plug of Unit 02. It was lonely by herself, even though she knew her mom was right beside her. But she still wished that he was there also.  
“真嗣……你去了哪里？”她对着 02 号机插入栓内的空旷喃喃自语。独自一人，即便知道母亲就在身边，她仍希望他也在那里。

Though just as she was thinking of moving from her spot, she felt something very strong rush past her, almost as though it was a gust of wind. But it didn't come from outside, it had happened to herself, it was like a feeling. But then it returned, and it wasn't a gust of wind this time...it was warm.  
尽管她正想着离开原地，却感到一股异常强烈的气息掠过她，仿佛一阵疾风。但这并非来自外界，而是源自她自身，一种难以言喻的感觉。然而，它再次袭来，这次不再是风...而是温暖。

"Asuka!" “明日香！”

Asuka was suddenly assaulted by strong feeling that was certainly not her own, because it pertained to herself, but she also recognized the feeling for what it was. And she also recognized the voice...but she couldn't believe it.  
明日香突然被一种强烈的情感所侵袭，这显然不是她自己的感受，因为它与她自身有关，但她却能辨识出这种情感。同时，她也认出了那个声音...但她不敢相信。

"Sh-Shinji?" she spoked out loud inside the entry plug. She wasn't sure if it was just her imagination or not, be she was sure she had heard his voice.  
“真-真嗣？”她在插入栓内大声说道。她不确定这是否只是她的想象，但她确信自己听到了他的声音。

"Yeah, its me Asuka," replied Shinji.  
"是啊，是我，明日香。" 真嗣回答道。

"Shinji," stammered Asuka, not caring how she was able to communicate only glad that she could hear his voice. "Where are you right now? Whats happening? Where did you go?"  
"真嗣，" 明日香结巴着说，不在乎她是怎么能交流的，只庆幸能听到他的声音。"你现在在哪里？发生了什么？你去哪儿了？"

"Then I'm right in assuming you've been watching the entire time?"  
"那么我猜对了，你一直在看着这一切？"

"...I-" "...我-"

"Don't worry about it, it makes it easier. Asuka, I don't have much time, but I need your help...I think."  
"别担心，这样更简单。明日香，我没多少时间了，但我需要你的帮助...我觉得。"

"You think?" asked Asuka accusingly.  
"你觉得？" 明日香带着责备的语气问道。

"Asuka...I don't have time to say everything I would like to, but know this that I feel better with you by my side. So-"  
"明日香...我没时间说所有我想说的，但请知道，有你在身边，我感觉好多了。所以——"

"It took you this long to say that huh?" said Asuka with a sigh. "Idiot!"  
"你花了这么久才说这话啊？" 明日香叹了口气说，"笨蛋！"

Shinji smiled slightly, which was conveyed to Asuka, in whose turn smiled back also.  
真嗣微微一笑，这让明日香也感受到了，她随即回以微笑。

"Is there anything I can do?" asked Asuka.  
"有什么我能做的吗？" 明日香问道。

"Just you being by my side is enough," said Shinji, feeling oddly serene. "Do you remember where the old access point is?"  
"只要你在身边就足够了，" 真嗣感到莫名宁静地说，"你还记得旧的接入点在哪里吗？"

"Yeah..." "嗯..."

"Meet me there, I'll try to shake of Lilith in the mean time. Avoid the Eva Units...I don't want you fighting them."  
"在那儿见，我会尽量甩开莉莉丝。避开 Eva 机体……我不想你和他们战斗。"

Asuka knew enough not retort back. Shinji was simply looking out for her, which she appreciated.  
明日香知道不必回嘴。真嗣只是在关心她，这让她心存感激。

"Then I'll see you there," mumbled Asuka. "And Shinji...be careful."  
"那我们那儿见，""明日香咕哝道，""还有，真嗣……小心点。"

"I know...you too...and I'll be waiting."  
"我知道...你也是...我会等着你。"

"Yeah," mumbled Asuka as the warmth suddenly left her, along with Shinji's voice. Making Unit 02 stand up from its kneeling position, she mumbled softly, "Lets go...Mama."  
"嗯，"阿斯卡喃喃道，随着真嗣的声音和温暖突然消失。她让零二号机从跪姿站起，轻声嘀咕，"走吧...妈妈。"

Unit 02's eyes lit up in response to Asuka's request, and started walking forward towards the battle below.  
零二号机的眼睛因阿斯卡的请求而亮起，开始向下方战场走去。

---

As Asuka's warmth also left Shinji, he looked up into the sky of Tokyo-3 from where he was hidden. He didn't know what Asuka's presence would bring, but he knew that just by her being near him, he would be better.  
随着明日香带来的温暖也从真嗣身边消散，他抬头望向隐藏处的东京-3 的天空。他不知道明日香的陪伴会带来什么，但他知道，只要有她在身边，他就会变得更好。

Swinging out into the open sunlight, he was met by a grizzly scene. Lilith was standing just outside of the shaft he was hiding in and waiting for him to appear.  
他摇摆着进入开阔的阳光下，却目睹了一幕令人毛骨悚然的景象。莉莉丝正站在他藏身的竖井外，等待着他现身。

"I see you," laughed Lilith as she swung her arm down, generating her AT-field and slicing into the metal shaft. Shinji dodged out of the way and projected both his AT-field and Unit 01's. Lilith easily parried both of them, now that Shinji's AT-field was no longer backed by Adam's power.  
“我看到你了，”莉莉丝大笑着挥动手臂，生成了她的 AT 力场并切入金属竖井。真嗣闪避开来，同时展开了自己的 AT 力场和初号机的力场。莉莉丝轻松地挡开了这两者，如今真嗣的 AT 力场已不再有亚当的力量支持。

"Not a chance Shinji," laughed Lilith. "You don't have any hope of defeating me, so just accept it!"  
“没门，真嗣，”莉莉丝笑道，“你毫无胜算，还是认命吧！”

Shinji grimaced at Lilith as he started running the opposite way, jumping over buildings and power lines as he went. But as Lilith followed she ripped apart the landscape of Tokyo-3.  
真嗣对着莉莉丝皱了皱眉，转身开始狂奔，跳过一栋栋建筑和电线杆。然而，莉莉丝紧随其后，将第三新东京市的地貌撕扯得支离破碎。

After a time though, Shinji thought that he had ran far enough and turned around to face Lilith. Swinging down Unit 01's right arm, he projected its AT-field and threw it at Lilith who blocked it as though it was a fly. Next second though, Shinji's own AT-field came rushing at Lilith, being masked by the first.  
一段时间后，真嗣觉得自己已经跑得够远了，便转身面对莉莉丝。他挥动零号机的右臂，展开其 AT 力场并朝莉莉丝掷去，后者如同驱赶苍蝇般将其挡开。然而下一秒，真嗣自己的 AT 力场也向莉莉丝冲去，被前一个力场所掩护。

"Tch," mumbled Lilith as she blocked Shinji's own AT-field. But next second, dust was scattered in every direction as Shinji had attacked the ground and kicked up mountains of dust, created a smoke screen. When the dust finally cleared though, Unit 01 and Shinji were nowhere to be seen.  
"啧，" 莉莉丝咕哝着，挡住了真嗣的 AT 力场。但下一秒，尘埃四散，真嗣攻击地面，扬起了如山的尘土，制造了一片烟幕。然而当尘埃最终散去时，初号机和真嗣已不见踪影。

"A diversion?" wondered Lilith, "and he even seems to hiding his AT-field. I have to give him props on that. So I guess that he's meeting up with that girl."  
"声东击西？" 莉莉丝思索着，"他甚至似乎在隐藏自己的 AT 力场。这一点我得给他点赞。看来他是去和那个女孩会合了。"

Smiling slightly, she changed her face back to that of Ayanami Rei, and started searching for Shinji and Asuka.  
她微微一笑，变回了绫波零的面容，开始寻找真嗣和明日香。

Meanwhile, Shinji was tearing through the city towards the point where he and Asuka had decided to meet at. He had to be careful that he wouldn't run into the Eva Units though, so it was a little slow going.  
与此同时，真嗣正疾速穿越城市，朝着他与明日香约定的会合地点赶去。他必须小心，以免撞上 EVA 机体，因此行进速度稍显缓慢。

Eventually though, he reached the point where they had agreed upon, and waited. But as time started to pass, he was starting to get worried. Where exactly was Asuka? He thought about calling out to her again with his AT-field, but didn't want to risk it. If Lilith felt it...  
最终，他抵达了他们约定的地点，开始等待。但随着时间的流逝，他逐渐感到担忧。明日香究竟在哪里？他考虑再次用 AT 力场呼唤她，但又担心这样做会有风险。如果莉莉丝感应到了...

"Asuka...where are you?" he mumbled.  
“明日香...你在哪儿？”他喃喃自语。

"Right behind you," said Asuka as she jumped down into the abandoned access point, and it was abandoned for a reason. Many of the walls had rust on them and the elevator looked ready to fall off its hinges, but it was a good place to hide.  
"就在你后面，" 明日香说着跳进了那个废弃的接入点，这个地方被废弃是有原因的。许多墙壁上都生满了锈迹，电梯看起来随时都可能从铰链上掉下来，但这里是个藏身的好地方。

"You made it," sighed Shinji with relief.  
"你来了，" 真嗣松了口气叹道。

"Sorry...I got held up because of the Eva Units."  
"抱歉……我被 EVA 机体耽搁了。"

"But you didn't fight them?"  
"但你没有和他们战斗？"

"No, they were just looking around for us."  
"没有，他们只是在找我们。"

"Good," said Shinji. "那就好，" 真嗣说。

For a moment they looked at each other, just taking each other in, when Asuka eventually broke the silence.  
有那么一会儿，他们彼此对视，只是互相打量着，直到明日香最终打破了沉默。

"Do you actually have any idea how you're supposed to destroy Lilith?"  
“你真的知道该怎么摧毁莉莉丝吗？”

"No, and I was hoping you would. You came up with the idea to destroyed the Eva Units after all."  
“不知道，我正希望你能告诉我。毕竟，是你提出要摧毁 EVA 机体的。”

"Which didn't work," she reminded him.  
"那并没有奏效，" 她提醒他。

"It would have," said Shinji, "it should have. But Lilith..."  
"本该奏效的，" 真嗣说，"理应如此。但莉莉丝……"

"...What about Rei?" asked Asuka, "Is she still trapped inside Lilith."  
"……那绫波呢？" 明日香问，"她还困在莉莉丝体内吗？"

"Yeah...she is," mumbled Shinji, realizing just how hopeless the situation was.  
"是啊...她是，" 真嗣咕哝着，意识到情况是多么无望。

"...Shinji...what about earlier?"  
"...真嗣...那之前呢？"

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"You seemed to be able to fight Lilith earlier. What happened?"  
"你之前似乎能与莉莉丝战斗。发生了什么？"

Shinji was silent for a moment before he said, "I don't like it...the feeling I get when I decide to use my angel powers. I dislike Lilith greatly, for everything that she's done...but that feeling I felt before. That wasn't me."  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，然后说道：“我不喜欢……当我决定使用我的天使力量时的那种感觉。我非常讨厌莉莉丝，因为她所做的一切……但之前的那种感觉，那不是我。”

"But if its able to defeat Lilith-"  
“但如果它能打败莉莉丝——”

"I can't control it though," hissed Shinji. "Why do you think I never wanted you to get near me? If I ever went out of control, and something happened to you-"  
“可我控制不了它，”真嗣低声说道，“你以为我为什么一直不想让你靠近我？如果我失控了，而你发生了什么事——”

Shinji let his sentence drop, knowing that even now, it was a touchy subject within his mind. But Asuka continued.  
真嗣让自己的话戛然而止，他知道即便现在，这个话题在他心中仍是个敏感点。但明日香继续说道。

"Shinji...you said that you want me near you...what if I'm able to pull you out of that state if worse comes to worse?"  
“真嗣……你说你想让我在你身边……如果情况恶化，我能把你从那种状态中拉出来吗？”

Shinji thought of this for a second, and had to admit it had merit. After all, it was solely because of Asuka that he was able to maintain his sanity during his confinement at Nerv.  
真嗣对此思考了一会儿，不得不承认这有其道理。毕竟，正是因为明日香，他才能在 NERV 的监禁期间保持理智。

"Maybe," Shinji finally said. "But its too risky, and if something-"  
“也许吧，”真嗣终于说道，“但这太冒险了，万一出了什么事——”

"Nothing is going to happen to me!" replied Asuka roughly. "You wouldn't let that happen to me..."  
“我才不会有事！”明日香粗鲁地反驳，“你不会让我出事的……”

Shinji didn't want to tell her he wasn't sure about that. If he really went out of control...  
真嗣不想告诉她，他对此并不确定。如果他真的失控了……

"I don't know if I can still do it though. Before...Lilith had said something about...you...and that sorta set it off. But during the fight, it was like I was being controlled by another person."  
"我不知道我还能不能做到。之前...莉莉丝说了些关于...你...的事情，那似乎触发了什么。但在战斗中，我感觉自己像是被另一个人控制了。"

Shinji didn't mention his conversation with the voice.  
真嗣没有提及他与那个声音的对话。

"But you can still try," said Asuka. "And I'll be here with you. So-"  
"但你可以试试看，" 明日香说。"我会在这里陪着你。所以-"

"Alright," said Shinji cutting her off. "But at any sign of me...acting differently than I normally would...stop me."  
"好吧，" 真嗣打断了她。"但只要我一有...任何不同于平常的举动...就阻止我。"

"And how do I go about doing that?" asked Asuka politely.  
"那我该怎么做呢？" 明日香礼貌地问道。"

Wild half formed thoughts swarmed through Shinji's mind then, but he threw them away.  
那时，真嗣脑海中涌动着各种不成形的狂野念头，但他把这些念头都抛开了。

"You're voice," he said, "you're voice will do it. If I hear your voice...I should be fine."  
"你的声音，"他说，"你的声音会起作用的。如果我听到你的声音...我应该就会没事。"

"...Okay Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she stepped back. Inside the entry plug of Unit 02 however, she heard the voice of her mother speaking to her.  
"...好吧，真嗣，"明日香喃喃自语着后退了几步。然而，在二号机的插入栓内，她听到了母亲的声音在对她说话。

"Is this wise Asuka?" "这样做明智吗，明日香？"

"I trust Shinji," said Asuka simply. "And I know...he would never do anything to harm me."  
"我相信真嗣，" 明日香简单地说道。"而且我知道...他绝不会做任何伤害我的事。"

Asuka's mom was silent, unsure of what she should say to her daughter.  
明日香的妈妈沉默了，不确定该对女儿说什么。

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"Just be careful." "只是要小心。"

"I will Mama...please look after me for a while longer."  
"我会做到的，妈妈...请再照顾我一段时间。"

"I will," she replied as her voice faded back inside Unit 02.  
"我会的，"她回答道，声音在 2 号机内部渐渐消失。"

Sighing slightly, Asuka asked, "Are you ready Shinji?"  
轻轻叹了口气，明日香问道："准备好了吗，真嗣？"

"Yeah," he replied, feeling somewhat nervous.  
“嗯，”他回答道，感到有些紧张。

Breathing deeply, Shinji jumped into the sunlight out of the access point and immediately projected his AT-field in a wide dome, telling Lilith where he was. Beside him, Unit 02 suddenly sprang through the opening and stood just behind him.  
深吸一口气，真嗣从接入点跳入阳光中，立即展开宽阔的 AT 力场，向莉莉丝指示自己的位置。在他身旁，二号机突然穿过开口，站在他身后。

As Lilith saw the two, she instantly narrowed her eyes. This would be fun...  
当莉莉丝看到这两者时，她立刻眯起了眼睛。这将会很有趣……

This was...difficult for Shinji, as he had never willingly tried to slip into his angel self. It had always been anger that had set him off, but with Asuka by his side, he hoped he wouldn't let his anger overcome himself. The anger that he bore was because of the angel half in him, Adam's DNA, but even stronger than that was the anger held for Lilith, and tapped that enormous power. But he also kept the image of Asuka in his mind. Her laying on the couch back when they were living together, eating potato chips and watching T.V. Eating breakfast together, walking to school together, little things like this he kept in his mind as protection against his anger.  
这对真嗣来说...很困难，因为他从未自愿尝试过进入自己的天使形态。一直以来，都是愤怒驱使他失控，但有明日香在身边，他希望自己不会被愤怒所征服。他所承受的愤怒源于他体内的天使半身，亚当的 DNA，但比这更强烈的是对莉莉丝的愤怒，以及那股巨大的力量。但他也始终在心中保留着明日香的影像。他们同居时她躺在沙发上，吃着薯片看电视。一起吃早餐，一起上学，这些小事他都铭记在心，作为抵御愤怒的保护。

Slowly, his eyes started to turn a darker red. The LCL fluid in Unit 01 intensified and came to a boil, and Unit 01 responded by roaring louder then ever. Eventually, blood finally started to seep from his eyes, and that same feeling of being controlled by someone else seemed to envelope him. But he was in control this time, and was able to differentiate between friend and foe.  
渐渐地，他的眼睛开始变成更深的红色。初号机内的 LCL 液体加剧沸腾，初号机也随之发出前所未有的咆哮。最终，鲜血开始从他的眼中渗出，那种被他人操控的感觉再次笼罩了他。但这次他保持了控制，能够区分敌友。

"Shinji...do you feel okay?" asked Asuka.  
“真嗣...你感觉还好吗？”明日香问道。

Shinji let out a low sigh, and nodded, not wanting to say anything to her. When he was like this, he was more accustomed to feeling things through his AT-field. In particular, Asuka who he was so attuned to already, was thrown into clearer light. He felt her AT-field, ever shift of her body, every thought that crossed her mind, every memory that she had had. He even caught glimpses of the fragments, which had been there all along. If only he hadn't been so stupid, then things might have-  
真嗣发出一声低沉的叹息，点了点头，不想对她说什么。当他这样的时候，他更习惯通过他的 AT 力场去感受事物。特别是已经与他如此契合的明日香，她的形象变得更加清晰。他能感受到她的 AT 力场，她身体的每一次移动，她脑海中闪过的每一个念头，她拥有的每一个记忆。他甚至捕捉到了那些一直存在的碎片。如果他不是那么愚蠢，也许事情就会——

"Shinji!" shouted Asuka suddenly.  
“真嗣！”明日香突然喊道。

Shinji looked up and saw that Lilith was rushing towards them, her arm outstretched. Removing the dome that he had projected around them, Shinji charged at Lilith at the same breakneck speed. Letting out a loud roar, Unit 01 seemed to act without Shinji having to tell it to. Thrusting its arm forward, it projected its AT-field as a large wall to block Lilith from approaching. Lilith's own AT-field however crashed against Unit 01's, shattering it instantly. But as Lilith neared him, Shinji projected his own AT-field as a wall this time. Lilith saw this, and quickly generated her own AT-field, intending on crashing hers against his. As Shinji saw this however, he shouted within his mind at Asuka-  
真嗣抬头一看，发现莉莉丝正朝他们冲来，手臂伸展开来。他撤去了自己投射在他们周围的护罩，以同样惊人的速度向莉莉丝冲去。随着一声大吼，初号机似乎在没有真嗣指令的情况下自行行动了。它向前伸出一只手臂，用 AT 力场形成一道巨大的墙壁，阻挡莉莉丝的接近。然而，莉莉丝自身的 AT 力场撞击在初号机的力场上，瞬间将其击碎。但当莉莉丝靠近他时，真嗣这次用自己的 AT 力场形成了一堵墙。莉莉丝见状，迅速生成自己的 AT 力场，意图与他的力场相撞。然而，就在这时，真嗣在心中向明日香大喊——

"Get behind me!" “躲到我后面去！”

Not needing to ask why, Unit 02 took shelter behind Unit 01 just as the two AT-field collided.  
无需询问原因，二号机迅速躲到了初号机的背后，就在两股 AT 力场碰撞的瞬间。

The impact was like that of an N2 bomb going off. From the center of the impact and upwards, explosions happened which threatened to rip apart the very fabric of the atmosphere. The earth shook violently as a seismic shockwave was sent out from the epicenter of the two beings. Earthquakes were felt as far away as England. The clouds that had been high in the sky were suddenly blown away as the air itself seemed to crackle with energy from the two AT-fields.  
冲击如同引爆了一枚 N2 炸弹。从冲击中心向上，爆炸接连发生，仿佛要撕裂大气层的结构。大地剧烈震动，从两位巨人的中心向四周传播出地震波。远在英国都能感受到地震。原本高悬天空的云层被瞬间吹散，空气似乎因两股 AT 力场的能量而噼啪作响。

They were dead even, something that Lilith hadn't counted on, but as she smiled widely, Shinji saw why. Several Eva Units were rushing at him on either side, each with a Lance of Longinus in each hand. They planned on impaling him.  
他们势均力敌，这是莉莉丝未曾预料到的，但当她露出宽慰的笑容时，真嗣明白了原因。数台 EVA 单位正从两侧向他冲来，每只手都握着一根朗基努斯之枪。他们打算将他刺穿。

Thinking fast though, Shinji quickly generated Unit 01's AT-field and split it, sending it to either side of him where both of the Eva Units were cut off at their knees. Seeing this, Lilith frowned slightly, but continued on applying pressure to Shinji's AT-field. If she got it to break, it would be over. But Shinji next sent Unit 01's AT-field at Lilith, making her also split her AT-field and fend off the other side as Shinji continued sending Unit 01's AT-field at her. Now with Lilith on the defense, Shinji started applying more pressure to his own AT-field, trying to make Lilith's break.  
尽管情况紧急，但真嗣迅速生成了初号机的 AT 力场并将其分裂，分别推向两侧，切断了那两台 EVA 机体的膝盖。看到这一幕，莉莉丝微微皱眉，但继续对真嗣的 AT 力场施加压力。如果她能将其打破，战斗就会结束。然而，真嗣接下来将初号机的 AT 力场对准莉莉丝，迫使她也分裂自己的 AT 力场进行防御，同时真嗣持续向她发送初号机的 AT 力场。现在莉莉丝转为防守，真嗣开始加大对自身 AT 力场的压力，试图使莉莉丝的力场破裂。

"Stubborn human," snarled Lilith as she was starting to be pushed back. "Don't you know when to give up?"  
“顽固的人类，”莉莉丝咆哮着，开始被推后。“你难道不知道何时该放弃吗？”

"Thats something that's unique about us," laughed Shinji in return. "We always hold onto hope."  
“这就是我们与众不同的地方，”真嗣笑着回应。“我们总是怀抱希望。”

"Hope? Don't make me laugh," said Lilith. "Hope always fails!"  
"希望？别逗我笑了，"莉莉丝说，"希望总是落空！"

Just as soon as Shinji thought he was actually winning, he felt his AT-field start to crack. Lilith had steadily been applying pressure to one specific spot, whittling it down slowly. Knowing that he didn't have much time till it broke, Shinji shouted to Asuka-  
正当真嗣以为自己真的要赢了的时候，他感觉到自己的 AT 力场开始出现裂痕。莉莉丝一直在对准一个特定的点施加压力，缓慢地削弱它。知道自己的 AT 力场撑不了多久就会破裂，真嗣向明日香大喊——

"Get back, its gonna break soon!"  
"快退后，它马上就要破了！"

"Shinji I won't-" "真嗣，我不会——"

"Get back!" shouted Shinji. Quickly moving Unit 01's AT-field, he threw it against Unit 02, pushing it backwards. But that was all Lilith needed to break through. Without Unit 01 preoccupying her, she put all her strength into that one spot in Shinji's AT-field, instantly shattering it and the whole thing along with it.  
"退后！" 真嗣大喊道。他迅速调动初号机的 AT 力场，将其掷向二号机，迫使其后退。但这正是莉莉丝所需要的突破口。没有了初号机的牵制，她将全部力量集中于真嗣 AT 力场的一点，瞬间将其粉碎，连带整个力场一同崩溃。

"Damn it!" thought Shinji as he dove backwards, but he knew he wouldn't make it in time. Holding up Unit 01's arms, he felt Lilith's AT-field sink directly into the bindings that covered Unit 01's hands slicing clear through the hands.  
"该死！" 真嗣心中暗骂，同时向后猛跃，但他知道来不及了。他举起初号机的双臂，感受到莉莉丝的 AT 力场直接穿透了覆盖在初号机手上的束缚，将双手彻底切断。

Shinji screamed in agony as the pain was transferred to him. Looking down at this hands, he saw nothing there but a bloody stump. Bone stuck out of the arm as blood continued flowing out. As Shinji continued looking down at this hands though, he slowly felt the pain disappearing. The wound was already sealing itself up, and what looked like a new hand was already starting to grow.  
真嗣痛苦地尖叫起来，疼痛转移到了他身上。他低头看着自己的双手，只见那里只剩下一个血淋淋的残肢。骨头从手臂中突出，血液不断流出。然而，当真嗣继续低头看着自己的双手时，他渐渐感到疼痛消失了。伤口已经开始自行愈合，看起来一只新手已经开始生长。

"Damn it Adam!" swore Lilith as she threw her AT-field at Unit 01 again.  
“该死的亚当！”莉莉丝咒骂着，再次向 01 号机投掷了自己的 AT 力场。

Dodging around it, Shinji generated his own AT-field and finally managed to cut into the tissue of Lilith, slicing into one of her arms. But instead of blood flowing out, LCL fluid trickled out of the wound.  
真嗣灵活地躲避着，生成了自己的 AT 力场，终于成功切入莉莉丝的组织，切断了她的一条手臂。但流出的不是血液，而是 LCL 液体。

"Fuck You!" shouted Lilith as she swiped at Unit 01 again. But Shinji continued his attack. Generating his AT-field in quick bursts, Shinji managed to damage Lilith in many different spots until the ground was starting to be pooled in LCL fluid.  
“去你的！”莉莉丝咆哮着再次向初号机挥去。但真嗣继续他的攻击。他迅速生成 AT 力场，成功在多个部位对莉莉丝造成伤害，直到地面开始积聚 LCL 液体。

Stepping backwards, as tough to examine his work, Shinji smiled at what he saw. Lilith was obviously weakening.  
真嗣后退几步，仿佛在审视自己的成果，他对自己所见露出微笑。显然，莉莉丝正在衰弱。

'I can do this,' he thought.  
“我能做到，”他心想。

Running forward again, Shinji generated both his and Unit 01's AT-field. Lilith generated her own, but the damage that Shinji had already inflicted upon her was starting to show. The wounds continued opening as she continued moving her body. The face of Ayanami had even disappeared and been replaced by white nothingness.  
再次向前冲刺，真嗣激发了他和初号机的 AT 力场。莉莉丝也生成了自己的力场，但真嗣之前对她造成的伤害开始显现。随着她身体的移动，伤口不断裂开。绫波的脸甚至已经消失，取而代之的是一片空白。

"You won't defeat me," mumbled Lilith. "You're a puny human, while I am the creator of you."  
“你无法击败我，”莉莉丝喃喃自语，“你只是个渺小的人类，而我，是你们的创造者。”

"But you're forgetting Lilith," said Shinji, "Adam created me also."  
“但你忘了，莉莉丝，”真嗣说道，“亚当也创造了我也。”

Projecting his AT-field again, Shinji sliced into the soft tissue of Lilith's neck, creating a large wound which LCL fluid poured out of.  
再次展开他的 AT 力场，真嗣切入莉莉丝颈部的柔软组织，制造出一个巨大的伤口，LCL 液体从中喷涌而出。

"You fucking bitch!" screamed Lilith as the wound opened wider and her head slid of the shoulders.  
“你这个该死的婊子！”莉莉丝尖叫着，伤口扩大，她的头颅从肩膀上滑落。

The body of Lilith collapsed to the ground with a loud thud, LCL fluid still pouring out of the many wounds on the body. Shinji stood triumphant above the body in Unit 01, looking down at the dead body of Lilith. He had done it, he had defeated Lilith.  
莉莉丝的躯体轰然倒地，发出一声巨响，LCL 液体仍从身上的多处伤口中涌出。真嗣站在初号机中，居高临下地俯视着莉莉丝的尸体，他做到了，他击败了莉莉丝。

But where was Ayanami? Shinji didn't feel her AT-field...  
但绫波在哪里？真嗣没有感觉到她的 AT 力场...

...Something was wrong...  
……有些不对劲……

From behind him, he heard movement and spun around, but it was only Asuka.  
他身后传来动静，他转身一看，但那只是明日香。

"You did it Shinji," gasped Asuka. "You actually defeated Lilith."  
“你做到了，真嗣，”明日香喘着气说，“你真的打败了莉莉丝。”

"Don't act so surprised," sighed Shinji as he started returning to his former self.  
"别表现得这么惊讶，" 真嗣叹了口气，开始恢复原来的自己。

Asuka smiled at him, wishing that she could hug him. But two Evangelions hugging would look kinda awkward, and feel awkward for Shinji especially.  
明日香对他微笑，希望自己能拥抱他。但两台 EVA 拥抱看起来有点奇怪，尤其是对真嗣来说感觉会很尴尬。

"What about Rei though?" asked Asuka, suddenly realizing that she didn't see Ayanami anywhere.  
"那丽呢？" 明日香突然意识到她没看到绫波丽在哪里。

"I'm not sure," said Shinji as he looked back down at the body of Lilith. He couldn't of killed her...but he didn't feel anything from the dead body.  
"我不确定，" 真嗣说着，再次低头看向莉莉丝的尸体。他不可能是杀了她...但他从那具尸体上感觉不到任何东西。

...Something was wrong...  
……有些不对劲……

"Hey Asuka?" said Shinji as he turned back towards Unit 02.  
"嘿，明日香？" 真嗣说着，转身面向二号机。

Red... 红色...

Blood Red 血红

Shinji froze...unable to speak, his entire world crashing down upon him. Asuka...Asuka...  
真嗣僵住了...无法言语，他的整个世界轰然崩塌。明日香...明日香...

Behind Unit 02, stood one of the Eva Units, except that it had the face of Lilith. In its hand was a Lance of Longinus, and it was currently pierced through-  
在二号机后方，站着一台 EVA，只不过它的脸是莉莉丝的。它手中握着朗基努斯之枪，而此刻正刺穿——

"ASUKA!" shouted Shinji as blood spewed out out of the open wound in Unit 02's chest cavity.  
“明日香！”真嗣大喊，鲜血从二号机胸腔的伤口中喷涌而出。

Wrenching the lance out of Unit 02, Lilith flicked it lightly to shake off some of the blood. The Eva Units body was slowly forming into Lilith's body. But Shinji only had eyes for Unit 02. Throwing his AT-field forward, he wrapped the entry plug in his AT-field and projected himself into it. He could see everything, feel everything, and smell everything associated with the inside of the entry plug.  
莉莉丝猛地拔出长矛，轻轻一甩，甩掉了一些血迹。EVA 机体的形态正逐渐变成莉莉丝的身躯。但真嗣眼中只有二号机。他向前投射出 AT 力场，将插入栓包裹在自己的 AT 力场中，并投影进去。他能看见一切，感受一切，闻到一切与插入栓内部相关的事物。

Asuka was laying there, blood dribbling out of her mouth, her hands pressed over her stomach as blood continued pouring out. Shinji's presence filled the entry plug, taking in everything that he saw. No...it was impossible...improbable that something like this could. Not after they...  
明日香躺在那里，血从嘴角滴落，双手按在腹部，鲜血不断涌出。真嗣的存在充满了插入栓，吸收着他所看到的一切。不……这不可能……不可能发生这样的事。不是在他们……

"Asuka! Asuka!" shouted Shinji.  
“明日香！明日香！”真嗣大声呼喊着。

Grabbing her hand, Shinji held it against his face.  
真嗣抓住她的手，将其贴在自己的脸颊上。

There was warmth...slightly.  
那里有温度……一丝丝。

And slowly, Asuka opened her eyes.  
慢慢地，明日香睁开了眼睛。

"Ahh...Shin-" but before she could finish her words, she coughed and more bloody trickled out of her mouth.  
“啊...真-" 但她还没说完，就咳嗽起来，更多的血从她嘴里流了出来。

"Don't say anything!" shouted Shinji. "Give me a minute and I'll-"  
“别说话！”真嗣喊道，“给我一分钟，我会-”

"Shin...ji...don't bother. You can't do anything...to help."  
"真...嗣...别费心了。你什么...也帮不了。"

"Don't say that Asuka. DON'T SAY THAT!"  
"别这么说，明日香。别这么说！"

"You don't have to shout...idiot..."  
"你不必大喊大叫...笨蛋..."

Even now...she still... 即便此刻...她依旧...

Shinji started crying, crying softly as he held onto Asuka's hand. Everything, everything was ending. The world, the universe, everything was fucking ending, and Shinji didn't care. Asuka was...Asuka was the only...  
真嗣开始哭泣，他轻轻握着明日香的手，低声啜泣。一切，所有的一切都在终结。世界，宇宙，一切都在他妈的终结，而真嗣并不在乎。明日香是...明日香是唯一的...

You can't die...not yet. I haven't even said-  
你不能死...还不能。我甚至还没说——

Shinji suddenly felt as though a hook had been yanked behind his navel and felt himself being pulled backwards out of the entry plug of Unit 02. The last thing he saw was Asuka's face before everything blackened.  
真嗣突然感到肚脐后方仿佛被钩子猛地一拉，随即发现自己被拽出了 2 号机的插入栓。他最后看到的景象是明日香的脸庞，随后眼前一片漆黑。

He opened his eyes inside the entry plug of Unit 01 and knew instantly what had happened.  
他在初号机的插入栓内睁开眼睛，立刻明白了发生了什么。

"So sorry I had to end that suddenly, but I can't stand tearful goodbyes," smiled Lilith as she yanked the Lance of Longinus out of the back of Unit 02's head.  
“很抱歉突然结束这一切，但我实在受不了泪眼汪汪的告别。”莉莉丝微笑着，从 2 号机头部拔出了朗基努斯之枪。

Asuka had been killed instantly...  
明日香当场被杀...

Shinji sat inside Unit 01...  
真嗣坐在 01 号机内部...

Asuka was dead...Asuka was dead.  
明日香死了...明日香死了。

Its a joke...it has to be...right? Please tell me its a joke?  
这是个玩笑...一定是的...对吧？请告诉我这是个玩笑？

I saw her... 我看到她了...

It wasn't real. 那不是真的。

Asuka is dead...Asuka is dead  
明日香已经死了...明日香已经死了

Don't say it! 别这么说！

Asuka died...Asuka died 明日香去世了...明日香去世了

asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka asuka

"ASUKAAAAAAAAAA!" "明日香啊啊啊啊啊！"

Wings of light exploded out the back of Unit 01, wings that were colored like a blood red setting sun. Inside the entry plug of Unit 01...  
零一号机的背部爆发出光芒之翼，那翼色如血红的夕阳。在零一号机的插入栓内...

Ikari Shinji sat alone ad-mist the darkness that was enveloping the sky.  
碇真嗣独自坐在黑暗中，这片黑暗正逐渐笼罩着天空。

Unit 01 slowly started rising into the air, its eyes blood red. All the binders sealing its true power broke and fell off.  
初号机缓缓升空，双眼血红。所有封印其真正力量的拘束器逐一断裂脱落。

Below, Lilith smiled as Unit 01 continued rising into the sky. Around her, the Eva Units sprouted their wings and rose up into the sky to follow Unit 01, a Lance of Longinus clutched in each of their hands.  
下方，莉莉丝微笑着，看着初号机继续升空。在她周围，其他 EVA 机体展开翅膀，手持朗基努斯之枪，追随初号机飞向天空。

As they continued rising further into the air, Lilith raised her arms up into the air and split the sky apart, so that the final piece could return to its proper place.  
随着他们继续向高空升去，莉莉丝举起双臂，将天空撕裂，以便最后一块碎片能回归其应有的位置。

Laughing slightly as she waited for the true Lance of Longinus, she said-  
她轻笑着等待真正的朗基努斯之枪，说道——

"So begins Third Impact..."  
“第三冲击，就此开始……”

### Chapter 33: Falsity  

**Merry Christmas everyone! Here's my present to all my great readers!  
祝大家圣诞快乐！这是我送给所有伟大读者们的礼物！**

The clouds darkened high above the city of Tokyo-3, and around the world, similar things were happening; the entire world was being plunged into darkness. However Gendo Ikari did not seem to care about these things, even as he sat deep underground within the confines of Terminal Dogma.  
东京-3 市上空的云层变得愈发阴暗，世界各地也正发生着类似的情况；整个世界正逐渐陷入黑暗之中。然而，碇源堂似乎并不关心这些，即便他正深坐在地下终端教条区的深处。

Lilith had fooled him, and fooled everyone, but specifically him. He should have known himself incapable of being rejoined with Yui, for even if he was, what would he have done? And so, he laid himself to rest in Terminal Dogma, waiting for the last breathes of his life to leave him. It was even rather peaceful he thought as he lay there, for whatever happened afterwards, he knew he would never be apart of. Even if the world was recreated, and Third Impact achieved, his spirit would not reach it.  
莉莉丝愚弄了他，也愚弄了所有人，尤其是他。他本该知道自己无法与唯重聚，因为即便可能，他又会做什么呢？于是，他躺在了终端教条区，等待着生命的最后一息离去。他躺在那里，甚至觉得颇为平静，因为无论之后发生什么，他知道自己将不再参与其中。即便世界被重塑，第三次冲击达成，他的灵魂也不会触及。

"I really screwed up...Yui..." he mumbled as he looked up at the black ceiling. But he would never hear Yui's voice again.  
“我真的搞砸了……唯……”他喃喃自语，抬头望着黑色的天花板。但他再也不会听到唯的声音了。

"I should rather say so commander," came a voice from behind him. Recognizing the voice almost instantly, he mumbled, "So you've come to see me die, have you Dr. Akagi?"  
“我应该这么说，指挥官，”一个声音从他身后传来。他几乎立刻认出了这个声音，喃喃道：“所以你是来看我死的，是吗，赤木博士？”

"The least you could do is call me Ritsuko," she mumbled as she stepped out of the darkness and into light, looking at down at the dying commander of Nerv. "And it seems that I'm too late...Lilith has all ready been reborn."  
"至少你可以叫我律子，"她喃喃自语，从黑暗中走出，步入光明，低头看着奄奄一息的 NERV 指挥官。"看来我还是来晚了...莉莉丝已经重生。"

"It wouldn't have mattered, even with the assistance I gave her," said Gendo. "She would have found a way to Shinji."  
"即便有我的帮助，也无济于事，"碇源堂说道。"她总会找到接近真嗣的方法。"

As Ritsuko walked over to him, she fished a cigarette out of her pocket and lit it. Puffing on it briefly, she sighed and said, "You don't smoke, do you commander?"  
律子走向他，从口袋里掏出一支烟点燃。吸了一口后，她叹息道："指挥官，你不抽烟的，对吧？"

"No, I never took it up."  
“不，我从没尝试过。”

"Then you should take this time to enjoy one."  
“那这次你应该好好享受一下。”

Pulling another out of her pocket, her last one, she lit it before bending down and inserting it into the commanders mouth. Letting him inhale for a moment, she then removed it out of his mouth, and let him exhale deeply.  
她从口袋里又掏出一支，这是她最后一支了，点燃后弯下腰塞进指挥官的嘴里。让他吸了一会儿，她便将烟从他口中取出，让他深吸一口气再缓缓吐出。

"Why are you doing this?" asked Gendo.  
“你为什么要这么做？”源堂问道。

"Because there isn't anything we can do," said Ritsuko. "Everything is all up to Shinji now. What he decides, what he doesn't decide...everything will be as he wishes and desires. And Lilith will use that to her advantage. Shinji may very well be the creator of a new world, but Lilith will have a hand in it nonetheless."  
“因为除此之外我们别无选择，”律子说，“现在一切都取决于真嗣。他的决定，他的犹豫……一切都将如他所愿。而莉莉丝会利用这一点。真嗣或许会成为新世界的创造者，但莉莉丝也绝不会袖手旁观。”

"So you think you'll have a place in it?"  
“所以你认为自己能在其中占有一席之地？”

"I don't know," said Ritsuko. "But it won't matter whether I have a place or not, because I don't necessarily have to be there. As long as Shinji wishes it, he can create someone that looks like me, sounds like me, and has the same personality as me. But it still won't be me. So then what about you?"  
"我不知道，" 律子说，"但有没有我的位置并不重要，因为我未必非得在那里。只要真嗣希望，他可以创造一个看起来像我、听起来像我、性格也和我一样的人。但那终究不是我。那么你呢？"

Gendo was silent for a minute until he said, "My existence stops here, Shinji will be sure of that."  
碇沉默了一会儿，然后说："我的存在到此为止，真嗣会确信这一点。"

"Probably," said Ritsuko as she threw her cigarette to the ground and crushed it with her heel. "But Shinji can't deny that you took care of him when the likely thing would have been to put him in an orphanage."  
"大概吧，" 律子说着将烟蒂扔到地上，用鞋跟碾灭。"但真嗣无法否认，在很可能将他送进孤儿院的情况下，你照顾了他。"

"I took him in for my own agenda," said Gendo.  
"我收养他是出于自己的目的，" 碇源堂说道。

"Maybe, but deep down you cared for him, because of the piece of him that meant Yui once existed."  
"或许吧，但内心深处你关心他，因为他的那一部分意味着绫波曾经存在过。"

Gendo was silent, neither refuting her, nor agreeing with her.  
碇源堂沉默不语，既没有反驳她，也没有同意她的说法。

"But it doesn't matter...does it?" said Ritsuko. "Everything will be judged by Shinji, and my existence may disappear as well, since I angered him more than once on certain occasions."  
"但那又有什么关系呢...不是吗？" 律子说道，"一切都将由真嗣来评判，我的存在也许会随之消失，毕竟我在某些场合不止一次惹恼了他。"

Gendo was still silent, as though reflecting on his past actions, until he finally said-  
碇源堂依旧沉默，仿佛在反思过去的所作所为，直到他终于开口——

"Shinji holds the DNA of Adam within him, meaning that he is already a being surpassing the knowledge of humans and angels alike, because he is a hybrid. In essence, he is almost like the gods of old that used to be worshipped in ancient times."  
"真嗣体内拥有亚当的 DNA，这意味着他已经成为一个超越人类与天使知识的存在，因为他是一个混血儿。本质上，他几乎就像是古代被崇拜的那些古老神祇。"

"And you think he'll use his power to change the world? Will Lilith even allow him to change it to how he desires?"  
"你认为他会用他的力量去改变世界吗？莉莉丝会允许他按照自己的意愿改变它吗？"

"Lilith doesn't care what Shinji does, as long as she gets what she wants."  
"莉莉丝不在乎真嗣做什么，只要她得到她想要的。"

"And what is that?" "那她想要的是什么呢？"

"...I don't even think Lilith knows..." mumbled Gendo, almost quietly to himself.  
"...我甚至觉得莉莉丝自己都不清楚..." 源堂喃喃自语，声音几乎低到只有他自己能听见。

Ritsuko looked down at him, as she heard those mumbled words. Lilith and Adam, and Shinji and Asuka...  
听到这些低语，律子低头看着他。莉莉丝和亚当，以及真嗣和明日香...

"If that boy cares enough about that girl, then Lilith shouldn't be able to fully control him. As for Adam, he is simply a spectator, though I believe he wants whatever Shinji wants."  
"如果那个男孩对那个女孩足够关心，那么莉莉丝应该无法完全控制他。至于亚当，他只是一个旁观者，尽管我相信他想要的是真嗣所希望的。"

"And what happens if she dies?" asked Ritsuko. "What happens to Shinji then?"  
“那如果她死了呢？”律子问道，“真嗣会怎么样？”

Gendo was silent for a long while, until he finally mumbled, "If that girl dies...he won't care about reality. Reality will be whatever he desires it to be."  
碇源堂沉默了许久，最终喃喃道：“如果那女孩死了……他将不再关心现实。现实将变成他所期望的样子。”

Ritsuko stared down at Gendo, who was slowly starting to fade away, and would likely be dead before Third Impact was even over. If in a situation like that, where reality is whatever Shinji desires it to be...then what would it be like?  
律子低头看着碇源堂，他正慢慢消失，很可能在第三次冲击结束前就会死去。如果在这种情境下，现实变成了真嗣所期望的样子……那会是什么样呢？

"It would be pleasant for him," said Gendo, as though he was reading her thoughts. "But he wouldn't care about anybody else. We would all be floating in the sea of LCL fluid, while he escapes into his false reality."  
"对他来说会是愉快的，" 源渡说道，仿佛在读她的心思。"但他不会关心其他人。我们都会漂浮在 LCL 溶液中，而他逃入他的虚假现实。"

Ritsuko frowned and looked up at the ceiling of Terminal Dogma. If that were to come true, and reality would become dysfunctional...what would happen to the world as it stands?  
律子皱起眉头，抬头望向终端教条的天花板。如果那成为现实，世界变得功能失调...现存的世界会怎样？

"Only Lilith would know that question," said Gendo as his life continued to slip away.  
"只有莉莉丝知道那个问题的答案，" 源渡说道，他的生命继续流逝。"

---

Lilith watched as Unit 01 rose high into the air along with the Mass Produced Eva Units. The wings of light shown clearly against the blackened sky as Unit 01 continued rising into the air.  
莉莉丝注视着 01 号机与量产型 EVA 单位一同高高升入空中。在漆黑的天幕下，01 号机那光芒之翼清晰可见，它继续向空中攀升。

'So it comes to this?' thought Lilith.  
“最终还是走到了这一步吗？”莉莉丝心想。

Raising her arms up, she clove the sky in to, splitting the clouds and the heavens as she called for the Lance of Longinus, and deep with the confines of space, it answered her. Like the needle of a compass, it pointed directly towards her, being called back to earth where it once dwelt. It ripped apart the fabric of space as it plummeted towards earth, shaking the sky and creating a maelstrom of thunder and lightning.  
她举起双臂，劈开天际，云层与苍穹在她呼唤朗基努斯之枪的瞬间裂开。深藏于宇宙深处的那把枪回应了她。如同罗盘的指针，它直指她的方向，被召唤回曾栖息的地球。它撕裂了空间的结构，如流星般坠向地球，撼动天空，引发了一场雷电交加的旋涡。

As it charged down through the sky and into the ruins of Tokyo-3, Lilith caught it with her hand and held it next to her like a flag pole. Smiling slightly, she slowly rose above the destruction of Tokyo-3, the Lance of Longinus in her hand. Beneath, the bloodied mess of Unit 02 remained.  
当它从天空中疾驰而下，冲入东京-3 的废墟时，莉莉丝用手接住了它，像举着旗杆一样将它紧贴在身旁。她微微一笑，缓缓升起，手中的朗基努斯之枪在东京-3 的毁灭中显得格外醒目。下方，二号机的残骸血迹斑斑，依旧躺在那里。

The Eva Units above her formed a circle around Unit 01, each of them holding a Lance of Longinus in its hand. Lilith continued rising into the air until she became level with Unit 01, herself inside the circle of Eva Units.  
在她上方的 EVA 机体们围成一圈，围绕着零号机，每台机体手中都握着一支朗基努斯之枪。莉莉丝继续升空，直到与零号机齐平，自己也被 EVA 机群围在中央。

"Can you hear me Shinji?" asked Lilith. She had changed her features so that she looked like Asuka again, tormenting him only further. But no word came from Unit 01, only silence. Lilith didn't care though, and continued on as if she hadn't asked.  
“你能听到我说话吗，真嗣？”莉莉丝问道。她改变了外貌，再次变成了明日香的样子，进一步折磨着他。但零号机内毫无回应，只有沉默。莉莉丝并不在意，继续说着，仿佛她未曾问过。

Motioning to the other Eva Units, she directed them to attack Unit 01. Four of the Eva Units rushed Unit 01, the Lances of Longinus clutched tightly in their hands. They pierced the lances into both of Unit 01's hands and feet. Blood poured forth from Unit 01, and inside the entry plug of Unit 01, the same was likely happening. But he still did not speak.  
她示意其他 EVA 机体攻击初号机。四台 EVA 手持朗基努斯之枪冲向初号机，将长枪深深刺入初号机的双手和双脚。鲜血从初号机中涌出，而初号机插入栓内，恐怕也在发生同样的事情。但他依旧沉默不语。

The other Eva Units pierced their lances into points around the wings of light that surrounded Unit 01, sealing Unit 01's AT-field.  
其他 EVA 机体将长枪刺入环绕初号机的光翼周围，封锁了初号机的 AT 力场。

Smiling at the Eva Units, Lilith hovered over to Unit 01 until she was directly in front of it. Taking the true Lance of Longinus in her grasp, she plunged it directly through the core of Unit 01.  
莉莉丝对着 EVA 机体微笑，悬浮至初号机前，直到正对它。她握住真正的朗基努斯之枪，直刺入初号机的核心。

Unit 01 shuddered violently then, and Shinji finally answered with a resounding scream. A large quantity of blood was pouring out directly where his heart was supposed to be...but he wasn't dying. Everything was slipping away though it felt. Everything was growing foggy...but he could still hear Lilith's voice.  
初号机剧烈颤抖着，真嗣终于以一声响亮的尖叫回应。大量鲜血正从他心脏所在的位置涌出……但他并未死去。尽管一切都在逐渐消逝，感觉变得模糊……他仍能听到莉莉丝的声音。

"Third Impact...ahh how I've waited for this day. Everything shall be as it should have, and nothing will be as it has. All with the help of you Shinji."  
“第三次冲击……啊，我等这一天等了多久。一切都将回归正轨，一切都将不再如故。这一切，多亏了你，真嗣。”

The Eva Units that were hovering around suddenly jerked, as their heads suddenly split open, revealing the head of Lilith underneath. Their stomachs opened up to reveal their cores inside.  
周围悬浮的 EVA 机体突然猛地一震，它们的头部突然裂开，露出下方莉莉丝的头颅。它们的腹部也打开，露出内部的核心。

"Lets begin," said Lilith.  
“我们开始吧，”莉莉丝说道。

The bodies of the Eva Units suddenly exploded, from the core outwards, but instead of spilling blood, the white substance that Lilith seemed to be made of was floating in twelve different parts of the sky. Lilith opened her arms then, and accepted the Eva Units to her. Combining herself with the final angel, and the S2 engines, she generated her AT-field.  
EVA 初号机的身体突然从核心向外爆炸，但喷涌而出的并非鲜血，而是莉莉丝似乎由之构成的白色物质，它们飘散在天空的十二个不同部分。莉莉丝随即张开双臂，接纳了这些 EVA 机体。她与最后的使徒以及 S2 引擎融合，生成了自己的 AT 力场。

Shinji opened his eyes wearily, and as he looked out into the dark sky, he saw a horrible sight in front of him. The Lilith Asuka, with eyes that bled blood, was reaching for him. Shinji screamed, screamed until it felt like his chest would rip apart, but it didn't do him any good. The Lance of Longinus prevented not only himself, but Unit 01 from doing anything. He shouted at Unit 01 to move, for his mother to move, for the voice to move. But the only thing he heard back was his own voice as it bounced around the entry plug.  
真嗣疲惫地睁开眼睛，当他望向黑暗的天空时，眼前出现了一幕可怕的景象。血泪盈眶的莉莉丝·明日香正向他伸出手。真嗣尖叫起来，尖叫到仿佛胸膛都要撕裂，但这毫无用处。朗基努斯之枪不仅束缚了他自己，也阻止了初号机采取任何行动。他呼喊着让初号机移动，呼唤母亲移动，呼唤那声音移动。然而，回荡在插入栓内的只有他自己的声音。

"Now then," smiled Lilith as she reached for Shinji. "Let us become one..."  
"那么，"莉莉丝微笑着向真嗣伸出手。"让我们合为一体吧……"

Shinji screamed again, but felt darkness engulf him as Lilith took hold of him. But did he really care? After all, what did he have to live for anymore...if Asuka was.  
真嗣再次尖叫，但当莉莉丝抓住他时，黑暗吞没了他。但他真的在乎吗？毕竟，如果明日香已经……他还有什么可活下去的理由呢？

'Thats it,' he heard a soothing voice all around him. 'Give into the hopelessness that is.'  
'就是这样，'他听到四周传来一个安抚的声音。'沉溺于这无望之中吧。'

Maybe it was right...whatever it was. It would be pleasant just to give up. To close his eyes and not care about anything, anyone. Nothing would matter...  
或许那是正确的……无论它是什么。放弃一切会是多么愉快。闭上眼睛，不再关心任何事、任何人。一切都不再重要……

'You want to forget everything. All the pain that everyone put you through. That you've put others through. So forget about them. Forget about everything.'  
'你想忘记一切。所有加诸你身的痛苦，以及你带给别人的痛苦。所以忘掉他们吧。忘掉所有的一切。'

Shinji did just that.  
真嗣就这么做了。

---

Or so he thought. 他原以为如此。

But then...what was this? When last he remembered, everything had been dark...but this was unusually bright...and...warm? Like blood? No, a different warmth. Like a human's warmth...like that of a warmth shared between two humans.  
但随后...这是什么？他最后记得一切都是黑暗的...但现在异常明亮...而且...温暖？像血？不，是另一种温暖。像人类的温暖...就像两个人之间共享的那种温暖。

So then where was he?  
那么他究竟在哪儿？

Shinji opened his eyes. 真嗣睁开了眼睛。

He looked around. 他环顾四周。

And then he remembered...  
然后他想起来了...

"Oh, right, Touji and Kensuke were over last night...and...ah I think I drank too much. Was Misato there?" He couldn't even quite remember. But that at least explained why he was so disoriented.  
“哦，对了，昨天晚上东治和真希波来过……还有……啊，我好像喝多了。美里也在吗？”他甚至记不太清楚了。但这至少解释了他为何如此晕头转向。

But then still...what was this warmth...and why was his vision so blurry?  
但即便如此……这种温暖感又是怎么回事……为什么他的视线如此模糊？

What felt to be bed sheets, glided across his hand as he reached around in the brightness. He could distinguish shapes, but not very well. Had he gone blind? Since when had his eyes been this bad?  
当他伸手在明亮中摸索时，感觉像是床单的东西滑过他的手。他能分辨出形状，但不太清晰。难道他失明了？他的视力何时变得这么差了？

'Oh...wait!' he remembered.  
'哦...等等！' 他想起来了。

Almost in a trance, he turned towards a table next to him, and grabbed his glasses where he had left them last night. He must have really been tired to momentarily forget about them.  
他几乎像是在恍惚中，转向身边的一张桌子，抓起了昨晚放在那里的眼镜。他一定是真的累了，才会暂时忘记它们。

Now that he was wearing his glasses, the room came into focus. It was odd though, it felt like this was first time seeing the room, but that was probably a hangover telling him that. Directly in front of him, a large window, with what looked like an oceanic view was clearly visible within his sight. To the left of the window, was a large white dresser that matched perfectly with the white wall behind it. Against a far corner of the room, was a mirror, large enough for Shinji to see his entire reflection in. Feeling slightly curious, he pushed himself off what he now knew to be a bed, and walked over to a mirror.  
现在戴上了眼镜，房间变得清晰起来。尽管如此，感觉像是第一次看到这个房间，但这大概只是宿醉在作祟。正前方是一扇大窗户，窗外似乎是一片海洋景色，清晰地映入眼帘。窗户左侧是一个与白色墙壁完美搭配的大白梳妆台。房间远处的角落里，有一面足够让真嗣看到全身的大镜子。带着些许好奇，他从现在知道是一张床上起身，走向镜子。

His twenty-two year old self looked back at him. His hair was slightly longer and stuck up at the back exactly as his fathers had. He smiled at this as he recognized features shared between himself and his parents. And speaking of which, he hadn't seen his parents in a while, maybe he should call them later.  
他二十二岁的自己回望着他。头发稍长，后脑勺翘起的模样和他父亲如出一辙。他对此微笑，认出了自己与父母间的共同特征。说到父母，他有一阵子没见到他们了，或许晚些时候应该给他们打个电话。

His face was obviously slightly older, which made he confused, as he didn't remember looking this old, though for some reason, he thought there was a reason for that maybe. But the eyes were the same, the same brown eyes shared between himself and his mother. Though from the looks of things, he needed glasses just like his father. Without them, he could barely see.  
他的脸显然略显成熟，这让他感到困惑，因为他不记得自己看起来这么老，尽管不知为何，他觉得可能有原因。但眼睛是一样的，那双与他母亲相同的棕色眼睛。从外表看，他需要像父亲那样的眼镜。没有眼镜，他几乎看不清东西。

Turning back around, he looked at the rest of the room. On the opposite side of the wall, another window was built into the side of the house giving a clear view of what looked to be a city off into the distance. Shinji looked around much of the rest of the room, looking at the light fixture on the ceiling, the white oak paneled door. The bedside table where he had retrieved his glasses which also had a book he had steadily been going through. The wooden frame of the bed, and the soft white cotton fabric that covered the bed. The person sleeping on the opposite side of the bed-  
他转过身来，环顾房间的其他部分。在墙的另一侧，房子的一边嵌着另一扇窗户，透过它可以看到远处似乎是一座城市的清晰景象。真嗣仔细打量了房间的其他地方，目光停留在天花板上的灯具、白色的橡木镶板门上。床头柜上放着他取回的眼镜，还有一本他一直在读的书。床的木质框架，以及覆盖在床上柔软的白色棉布。在床的另一边睡着一个人——

Shinji did a double take.  
真嗣愣了一下，又仔细看了看。

...There had been a person sleeping next to him...in the bed that he had been sleeping in...  
...在他睡的那张床上，竟然有个人睡在他旁边...

Shinji gaped open mouth at this, during which the person wrapped in blankets started shifting their weight. Shinji could see the outline of the person's back as they turned away from him. He couldn't the face or head though; they seemed to have buried themselves deep under the covers.  
真嗣目瞪口呆地看着这一幕，与此同时，裹在毯子里的人开始挪动身体。真嗣能看到那人转身时背部的轮廓。但他看不到脸或头部；他们似乎把自己深深地埋在了被子里。

'What do I do?' thought Shinji. He was starting to wonder if he even lived here, and if him, Touji, and Kensuke hadn't accidentally broke into someone else's house during the night. But that was impossible, he remembered everything in this room, except for this person. Was it some girl he had met during the night?  
'我该怎么办？' 真嗣心想。他开始怀疑自己是否真的住在这里，以及他和东治、健介是否在夜间不小心闯入了别人的家。但这不可能，他记得这个房间里的一切，除了这个人。难道是他在夜间遇到的某个女孩？

Flinching and sweating he slowly walked over to the edge of the bed and peered over towards the form of the person, though thats when the person turned towards him. Barely visible, poking out of the blankets was a forehead that gleamed like a pearl. Shinji stared at this for a while, gulping slowly, feeling extremely nervous over the situation.  
他畏缩着，满头大汗，慢慢地走到床边，朝那个人的身影望去，就在这时，那人转向了他。隐约可见，从毯子里露出的额头像珍珠一样闪闪发光。真嗣盯着看了好一会儿，慢慢地咽了咽口水，感到极度紧张。

A groan came from inside the blankets though, and the person shifted again, this time revealing more of the face. Her entire face came into frame then. The curve of her nose; the pronounced cheek bones; the perfectly shaped mouth; the light blue shade of her eyes; the glisten of her teeth as her mouth slowly opened and closed. And the hair...the silky strawberry hair that he loved to stroke late into the night when they were somewhere between sleeping and dreaming. Without a doubt, it was certainly-  
尽管如此，毯子下传来了一声呻吟，那人再次挪动，这次露出了更多的脸。她的整张脸随即映入眼帘。鼻梁的曲线；突出的颧骨；完美形状的嘴唇；淡蓝色的眼眸；随着她慢慢张合嘴巴而闪耀的牙齿。还有那头发...那柔顺的草莓色秀发，他喜欢在深夜时分轻抚，那时他们正介于睡梦与清醒之间。毫无疑问，这确实是——

"Asuka," mumbled Shinji as though he had never spoken the word in his life.  
“明日香，”真嗣咕哝着，仿佛他从未说过这个名字。

At Shinji's words, she seemed to stir slightly. Opening her eyes slowly, she looked back into the face that she woke up to every morning and mumbled a very sleepy-  
听到真嗣的话，她似乎微微动了动。缓缓睁开眼睛，她望向每天清晨醒来面对的那张脸，迷迷糊糊地咕哝了一声——

"Ah...Shinji? What time is it?"  
“啊...真嗣？现在几点了？”

She did this as she rubbed her eyes with her small fists. Shinji however gaped back at her, unsure whether what he was seeing was true, or something that-  
她一边用小拳头揉着眼睛，一边这样问道。然而，真嗣却目瞪口呆地看着她，不确定自己所见是真实的，还是某种——

No, he couldn't remember...  
不，他记不清了...

But it was Asuka! It was certainly Asuka!  
但那是明日香！确实是明日香！

And Shinji embraced her as he had never done before, wrapping both his arms around her slim back and pulling her against his chest, burying his face in her lovely smelling hair.  
真嗣以前从未如此拥抱过她，双臂紧紧环抱着她纤细的背部，将她拉向自己的胸膛，脸埋进她散发着迷人香气的一头秀发中。

"Eh? Shinji?" Asuka complained as she felt confused over these affections this early in the morning.  
“诶？真嗣？” 明日香抱怨道，她对一大早就这样突如其来的亲昵感到困惑。

"Asuka," mumbled Shinji again. "Asuka..."  
"明日香," 真嗣再次喃喃道。"明日香..."

"What? Are you still a little drunk from last night? I know we both drank too much then normal, but cutting loose sometimes is a good thing."  
"怎么？你昨晚还没醒酒吧？我知道我们都喝得比平时多，但偶尔放松一下也是好的。"

Shinji simply hugged her tighter, enjoying the warmth being shared between their two bodies. This is what he loved. This is what he desired.  
真嗣只是更紧地抱住她，享受着两人身体间传递的温暖。这就是他所爱的。这就是他所渴望的。

This is what he missed.  
这就是他所错过的。

Missed? Why would he- 错过？他为什么会——

"Umm...Shinji? As much as I'm enjoying this...can you let go?" asked Asuka quietly.  
“嗯……真嗣？虽然我很享受……你能放手吗？”明日香轻声问道。

Shinji pulled back slightly and looked into Asuka's eyes, seeing them wavering slightly. What was it about those eyes that made him so...  
真嗣微微后退，凝视着明日香的眼睛，发现它们微微颤动。那双眼睛究竟有什么魔力，让他如此...

"Oh...sorry," mumbled Shinji as he let go.  
“哦...对不起，”真嗣咕哝着松开了手。

"Whats up with you?" asked Asuka. "You're not normally this clingy in the morning, did you have a bad dream or something?"  
“你怎么了？”明日香问道，“你早上通常不会这么黏人，是做了什么噩梦吗？”

"A bad dream?" wondered Shinji. "No, I don't remember anything like that-"  
"做噩梦了吗？" 真嗣疑惑地问。"不，我不记得有那样的梦-"

'...Forget...' '...忘掉...'

"Thats good then," smiled Asuka as she sat up and rested her back against the bed frame.  
"那就好，" 明日香微笑着坐起身，背靠在床架上。

Shinji smiled also, but it felt somewhat forced.  
真嗣也笑了，但感觉有些勉强。

"Soooo," said Asuka again, "what time is it?"  
“那么，”明日香又问道，“现在几点了？”

"Not sure," said Shinji, "I haven't been up for long."  
“不太确定，”真嗣回答，“我起床没多久。”

"Hmmm...well, in any case I guess I should start breakfast."  
"嗯...好吧，无论如何我想我该开始做早餐了。"

"...Huh?" Shinji blinked.  
"...啊？" 真嗣眨了眨眼。"

"Breakfast," repeated Asuka as she slid off the leg, and walked on the balls of her feet to their dresser. "What do you want?" she asked as she started looking for something temporary to toss on. She was only in her underwear, which Shinji was just realizing. The light from the sun as it reflected of her beautiful skin was almost too much for him to bear. He just wanted to wrap his arms around her and-  
"早餐，" 明日香重复道，她从床边滑下，踮着脚尖走向他们的梳妆台。"你想吃什么？" 她一边问一边开始寻找可以暂时披上的衣物。她只穿着内衣，真嗣这才意识到。阳光照在她美丽的肌肤上反射出的光芒几乎让他无法承受。他只想张开双臂抱住她——

"Waffles okay?" asked Asuka as she threw a shirt over her head and started putting on a pair of shorts.  
"华夫饼可以吗？" 明日香一边问着，一边将一件衬衫套在头上，开始穿上短裤。

"What?" said Shinji completely distracted by Asuka's beauty.  
"什么？" 真嗣完全被明日香的美貌分了心。

"Waffles silly," laughed Asuka as she walked past him. "They're your favorite right?"  
"华夫饼，傻瓜，" 明日香笑着从他身边走过。"你最喜欢的，对吧？"

"Huh?" asked Shinji, but next second, such an unbelievable hunger to have waffles made by Asuka engulfed him to the point he thought his mouth might start watering.  
"啊？" 真嗣问道，但下一秒，一种难以置信的渴望——想要吃到明日香亲手做的华夫饼——吞噬了他，以至于他觉得自己可能要流口水了。

"Oh...yeah," said Shinji, realizing just how hungry he was. "Thanks Asuka."  
"哦...对啊，" 真嗣意识到自己有多饿，"谢谢你，明日香。"

"Don't mention it," smiled Asuka, "I love cooking for you Shinji!"  
"别客气，" 明日香微笑着说，"我喜欢为你做饭，真嗣！"

Shinji felt this statement odd for some reason, but let it slide. As Asuka walked passed him though, she pecked him briefly on the cheek with her lips.  
不知为何，真嗣觉得这话有些奇怪，但还是没说什么。然而，当明日香从他身边走过时，她迅速地在他的脸颊上轻轻吻了一下。

"And it was great seeing Touji and Kensuke yesterday, I haven't seen them in ages, though it was too bad Hikari couldn't come."  
“昨天见到阿薰和健介真是太好了，我好久没见到他们了，不过很遗憾，美里没能来。”

"Oh...yeah," mumbled Shinji. "It was fun."  
“哦……是啊，”真嗣含糊地应道，“挺开心的。”

"Jeez, whats up with you this morning?" pouted Asuka. "First you embrace me lovingly, and then you act like you forgot things."  
"哎呀，你今天早上怎么了？" 明日香噘嘴道，"先是深情拥抱我，然后又像忘了什么事似的。"

"Sorry," said Shinji, "I guess I'm just a bit hungover."  
"对不起，" 真嗣说，"我想我只是有点宿醉。"

"Hmmm...and here I was hoping to spend some time with you after breakfast before your parents got here," mumbled Asuka quietly.  
"嗯……我还想着早餐后能和你待一会儿，你父母来之前呢，" 明日香小声嘀咕道。"

"My parents are coming?" asked Shinji incredulously.  
"我父母要来？" 真嗣难以置信地问道。

"Of course, you called them a few days ago and told them we wanted to see them. After all, we haven't seen them since our wedding, though they both weird shifts over at Nerv so its to be expected."  
"当然，你几天前给他们打了电话，告诉他们我们想见他们。毕竟，自从我们结婚后就没见过他们了，虽然他们在 NERV 的工作时间都很奇怪，这也是可以理解的。"

'Marriage?' thought Shinji as he looked blankly at Asuka.  
'结婚？' 真嗣茫然地看着明日香心想。

Him and Asuka were...married?  
他和明日香...结婚了？

"Well, I'll get stared on breakfast then," beamed Asuka as she left their bedroom, leaving Shinji to stand there in confusion.  
“好吧，那我开始做早餐了。”明日香笑着离开了卧室，留下真嗣站在那里一脸困惑。

As he looked around at the bedroom, he noticed pictures that he hadn't noticed before. Walking over to one, he picked it up at random and stared at it. Him and Asuka, both around the ages of ten from the look of things were sitting at a park bench together and eating ice cream. They were both turned to each other and smiling. Turning the picture around, Shinji saw that words were scribbled on the back.  
当他环顾卧室时，注意到了一些之前未曾留意的照片。他随意拿起一张，凝视着。照片中的他和明日香，看起来大约十岁左右，正坐在公园长椅上一起吃冰淇淋。两人都转向对方，面带微笑。真嗣翻过照片，发现背面写着字。

_Asuka and Shinji, Zoo Trip, 2010  
明日香和真嗣，动物园之旅，2010 年_

Looking around, Shinji saw that similar pictures of him and Asuka littered the bedroom upon the walls and dresser. Many of them were of them as kids, though a few were of them older. When they were in high school, college, and what finally looked like their wedding day. Shinji could see himself very clearly kissing Asuka in the photo. She looked beautiful in her white gown, her long hair flowing freely behind her.  
环顾四周，真嗣发现墙上和梳妆台上散落着许多他和明日香的照片。其中许多是他们儿时的照片，但也有一些是他们长大后的。高中时，大学时，最后一张看起来像是他们婚礼当天的照片。真嗣可以清楚地看到自己在照片中亲吻明日香。她穿着白色婚纱，美丽动人，长发自由地飘扬在身后。

Shinji smiled then, remembering the feel of Asuka's lips as he kissed her. Of course, they had kissed many times before that, but during there wedding, it had been something special.  
真嗣微笑着，回忆起亲吻明日香时她嘴唇的感觉。当然，他们之前已经接吻过很多次，但在婚礼上，那是一种特别的感受。

That was a year ago, but really, when Shinji thought about it him and Asuka had known each other there wholes lives. There parents worked at Nerv together, so it was inevitable that they would meet eventually. They had been childhood friends for as long as Shinji could remember. But they had eventually grown to love each other. When this happened though, Shinji couldn't remember.  
那是一年前的事了，但说真的，当真嗣思考时，他和明日香其实从小就认识。他们的父母都在 NERV 工作，所以他们迟早会相遇。真嗣记得他们一直是儿时玩伴。但最终，他们相爱了。至于这一切是如何发生的，真嗣却记不清了。

'How could I have forgotten something like this?' wondered Shinji.  
“我怎么会忘记这样的事呢？”真嗣疑惑着。

He didn't know, and it bugged him slightly. But, his parents were coming later that day, so it was best not to worry about it.  
他不知道，这让他有点困扰。但，他的父母那天晚些时候会来，所以最好不要为此担心。

Shrugging, Shinji left the bedroom and walked down the stairs to the kitchen below where the aroma of waffles filled his nostrils.  
耸了耸肩，真嗣离开了卧室，走下楼梯来到厨房，那里华夫饼的香气充满了他的鼻腔。

As morning ticked away, and afternoon slowly set in, Shinji and Asuka started preparing for Shinji's parents to arrive. They hadn't seen each other in a year, so tensions were rather high. It wasn't as if Shinji's parents had been upset with Asuka as a wife, it was just that they thought they should have waited longer. But when the time came, both Shinji's father and mother agreed that Asuka was the best choice for a wife. Shinji and Asuka had known each forever after all.  
随着早晨的时光一点点流逝，午后渐渐来临，真嗣和明日香开始为真嗣的父母到来做准备。他们已经一年没见面了，所以气氛相当紧张。并不是真嗣的父母对明日香作为妻子有什么不满，只是他们认为应该再等一段时间。但当那一刻到来时，真嗣的父母都一致认为明日香是最佳的妻子人选。毕竟，真嗣和明日香从小就认识。

Since it had been some time since Shinji had seen his parents though, he wanted them to have the best impression of him as best possible, and Asuka of course. It was amazing though at how lax they had become around each other. This would of course have to improve upon when Shinji's parents came to visit. The nice thing about Asuka, compared to what most people seemed to think about her, she was unusually tidy. In fact, much of those two hours spent before Shinji's parents arrived, Asuka spent cleaning the entire house, except for the bedroom. Shinji had told her that he didn't want his parents entering it, and that if they tried, he would stop them. It was there own special place.  
虽然已经有一段时间没见到父母了，但真嗣希望他们能对他和明日香留下最好的印象。令人惊讶的是，他们彼此之间的放松程度。当然，当真嗣的父母来访时，这一点必须改进。与大多数人似乎对她的看法相比，明日香有一个优点，她异常整洁。事实上，在真嗣父母到来前的两个小时里，明日香花了大部分时间打扫整个房子，除了卧室。真嗣告诉她，他不希望父母进入卧室，如果他们试图进去，他会阻止他们。那是他们自己的特别地方。

When two o' clock arrived though, Shinji heard the door bell ring. Knowing that Asuka was till getting ready, Shinji went ahead and decided to open the door, and there his parents stood, Yui and-  
当两点钟到来时，真嗣听到了门铃声。知道明日香还在准备中，真嗣决定先去开门，站在那里的是他的母亲——

Shinji paused...his father wasn't there, but his mother was. And this was the first thing he was about to ask, when his mother answered it for him.  
真嗣停顿了一下...他的父亲不在，但他的母亲在。这是他正要问的第一件事，但他的母亲已经为他回答了。

"Your father couldn't make it Shinji, he got stuck at the lab."  
“真嗣，你爸爸来不了了，他在实验室被耽搁了。”

She smiled though, showing that she was glad to see him at least.  
不过她笑了笑，表明至少见到他她还是很高兴的。

Stepping over the threshold of his house, Shinji brought his mom into a comforting hug, and brought her into his home.  
真嗣跨进家门，给了妈妈一个安慰的拥抱，将她迎进家中。

"Asuka is just upstairs," said Shinji. "She should be down in a minute."  
"明日香就在楼上，" 真嗣说道，"她应该一会儿就下来了。"

"I'm glad to see that you two are doing so well, and it looks like you've even peaked up a bit."  
"很高兴看到你们俩相处得这么好，看起来你们甚至还有所进步。"

"Well...Asuka is a wonderful cook so-" smirked Shinji.  
"嗯...明日香是个很棒的厨师，所以——" 真嗣微笑着说。"

"Don't you know when to stop with the flattery," came a voice from the open door of the kitchen. Shinji turned towards the sound of the voice and saw Asuka standing there. She had separated her hair and tied it into two twin tails. She had put on an old favorite of hers; the yellow summer dress that she had worn a lot when she was younger.  
"你还没完没了地拍马屁了，"厨房门口传来一个声音。真嗣转向声音的方向，看到明日香站在那里。她把头发分开了，扎成了两个双马尾。她穿上了一件旧爱；那件黄色夏装，是她小时候常穿的。

"Asuka, its been a while," smiled Yui. "You look good."  
"明日香，好久不见，"绫波微笑着说。"你看起来不错。"

"Thank you," replied Asuka. "Was Gendo not about to make it?"  
"谢谢，"明日香回答。"源堂不来吗？"

"No," said Yui sadly, "he had to work. But tell me, how is life with Shinji? He isn't a nuisance is he?"  
"不，" 绫悲伤地说，"他得工作。但告诉我，真嗣和你一起生活得怎么样？他没有给你添麻烦吧？"

"No, not at all," said Asuka hurriedly.  
"没有，一点也没有，" 明日香急忙回答。

"Thats a relief, I'm glad that Shinji didn't stay a kid forever."  
"那我就放心了，我很高兴真嗣没有一直是个孩子。"

"Mom," complained Shinji.  
"妈妈，" 真嗣抱怨道。

"Just kidding, just kidding," laughed Yui. "Though on a more serious note...when am I gonna get a grand child."  
"开个玩笑，开个玩笑，" 由依笑着说，"不过说正经的……我什么时候才能抱上孙子呢。"

"...WHAT!" shouted Shinji and Asuka at the same time.  
"……什么！" 真嗣和明日香同时喊道。

"Oh? Is it too early to ask about that?" said Yui feeling somewhat embarrassed. Though it was nowhere near as to how Asuka and Shinji felt.  
"哦？现在问这个是不是太早了？" 绫感到有些尴尬。不过，这远不及明日香和真嗣的感受那么强烈。

"Children...mom we've only lived here a year," mumbled Shinji, his face completely red.  
"孩子们...妈妈，我们才搬来这里一年，" 真嗣喃喃道，脸红得彻底。

"Kids? We-We haven't even, I mean...thought about it what I, I mean no. Not like that. Eh?" stuttered Asuka uncontrollably.  
"孩子？我们-我们甚至还没，我的意思是...考虑过这个，我，我是说没有。不是那样的。呃？" 明日香不由自主地结巴起来。

"Ah...sorry, sorry," said Yui trying to repair the situation. "But you know, you and Asuka have known each other for a long time."  
"啊...抱歉，抱歉，" 绫试图修复局面。"不过你知道，你和明日香已经认识很久了。"

"But mom...that and this are two completely different things," said Shinji.  
"但是妈妈...那和这个是完全不同的两件事，" 真嗣说。"

"Hmmm...well I suppose. But you know Misato and Kaji are already on there second-"  
"嗯...好吧，我想也是。不过你知道，美里和加持已经是第二次..."

"Mom!" "妈妈！"

"...Okay." "...好吧。"

After that, they enjoyed talking together, catching up with each other since the past year. Yui told Shinji about the ongoings of the lab and told Asuka what her mom has been doing also. Apparently, Nerv was working on something that was supposed to better the human race, or at least thats what Shinji and Asuka got out of the conversation they had with Yui.  
之后，他们愉快地聊了起来，互相分享过去一年的近况。Yui 向真嗣讲述了实验室的最新动态，并向明日香介绍了她母亲的近况。据悉，NERV 正在研发一项旨在改善人类的项目，至少这是真嗣和明日香从与 Yui 的对话中理解到的信息。

Though as the afternoon wore on, and set into evening, the sun started to go down across the ocean.  
尽管随着下午渐渐过去，夜幕降临，太阳也开始在海面上缓缓下沉。

"Well...I should get home," said Yui eventually. "Gendo will be getting home from the lab soon."  
"嗯...我该回家了，" 最终由 Yui 说道，"真嗣很快就会从实验室回来了。"

"Alright see you mom," said Shinji as he stood up to walk her to the door.  
"好的，再见妈妈，" 真嗣说着站起身来，陪她走到门口。

"I'll drag your father along next time," promised Yui, as she stood just outside the door.  
"下次我会拉上你父亲一起来的，" 优站在门外承诺道。

"I'll look forward to it," smiled Shinji.  
"那我就期待着了，" 真嗣微笑着说。

"Then...next time." "那么...下次见。"

"Right, next time," replied Shinji as he waved goodbye, before gently closing the door. Though the minute the closed, he turned to Asuka and said, "Sorry about that."  
“好的，下次见。” 真嗣挥手告别，然后轻轻关上门。然而门一关上，他就转向明日香说：“抱歉，刚才那事。”

Asuka blinked. "About what?"  
明日香眨了眨眼。“关于什么？”

Feeling slightly embarrassed, Shinji mumbled, "You know...what she said about grandchildren...about us having kids."  
感到有些尴尬，真嗣咕哝道：“你知道的……她提到孙子的事……关于我们生孩子的事。”

"Oh...that," mumbled Asuka.  
"哦...那个，" 明日香含糊地咕哝道。

They both stood in silence for a while. Shinji wasn't sure what he should say, as he didn't know to say. It was something they hadn't even discussed yet, so his mother bringing it up all the sudden was sorta...  
他们俩沉默地站了一会儿。真嗣不确定该说什么，因为他不知道该说什么。这是他们甚至还没讨论过的事情，所以母亲突然提起这件事有点...

"Hey...Shinji?" "嘿...真嗣？"

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"Lets go for a walk down on the beach."  
"我们去海边散步吧。"

"...What about dinner?" "...那晚餐怎么办？"

"That can wait, and the sun is just setting so its really gorgeous out. Plus, we haven't walked on it in a while."  
"那可以等等，太阳刚落山，外面的景色真的很美。而且，我们有一阵子没在上面散步了。"

Shinji looked at her for a second, before agreeing with her. It had been a while since they had done something like that.  
真嗣看了她一会儿，然后同意了她的提议。他们已经很久没有像这样一起做点什么了。

"Alright," said Shinji eventually. Walking over to her, he took a hold of her hand and walked out the back door of their house where they proceeded down the beach together.  
"好吧，"真嗣最终说道。他走到她身边，握住她的手，一起走出了房子的后门，沿着海滩漫步。

The house itself was really only temporary lodgings, though it really felt like a never ending honeymoon. It was an old Nerv employee get away house that, thanks to Shinji and Asuka's parents, they were able to get it for them. Tokyo-3 was a forty-five minute drive away, but Asuka and Shinji enjoyed living in the country side. When they finally found a place to live themselves, they wanted to find something similar to what they had now. And Shinji had to admit, it would be difficult finding anything better then what they had.  
这栋房子实际上只是暂时的居所，尽管它让人感觉像是一场永无止境的蜜月。这是一座旧的 NERV 员工度假屋，多亏了真嗣和明日香的父母，他们才能得到它。从这里到东京-3 需要四十五分钟的车程，但真嗣和明日香喜欢住在乡下。当他们最终找到自己的住处时，他们希望找到一个类似现在这样的地方。而真嗣不得不承认，要找到比他们现在更好的地方将会很困难。

The real bonus to the house though was that it had beach property that was exclusive to Nerv employees. Shinji and Asuka hadn't seen a single person at the beach since they had been there. It was there own little private beach, and they spent many sunsets walking the beach together or playing in the surf as they used to do as kids. But those days seemed to be slowly slipping away from them as they became older. So they wanted to enjoy these times as best they could.  
但这栋房子真正的额外好处是，它拥有专属于 NERV 员工的私人海滩。自从他们来到这里后，真嗣和明日香在海滩上从未见过其他人。这是他们自己的小私人海滩，他们一起度过了许多日落时分，漫步在海滩上或像小时候一样在海浪中嬉戏。但随着年龄的增长，那些日子似乎正慢慢从他们身边溜走。所以他们想尽可能地享受这些时光。

As they stepped down off the steps that led down to the beach, Asuka took off the shoes she was wearing and undid the braids that held her twins tails together, making her strawberry colored hair flow in the ocean breeze. Shinji took his shoes off also, enjoying the crunch of the sand between his toes.  
当他们走下通往海滩的台阶时，明日香脱掉了脚上的鞋子，解开了绑住她双马尾的辫子，让她的草莓色头发随海风飘扬。真嗣也脱下了鞋子，享受着沙子在脚趾间嘎吱作响的感觉。

They walked hand in hand as they crossed the sand dunes of the beach, walking just barely far enough away from the surf so that they caught the spray from it. Shinji wondered why Asuka had wanted to come out here so suddenly, as it usually only happened when she wanted to tell him something.  
他们手牵手穿过沙滩上的沙丘，走得离海浪足够远，刚好能感受到海浪的飞溅。真嗣想知道明日香为什么突然想来这里，通常只有在她想告诉他什么事情的时候才会这样。

And sure enough, Asuka suddenly let go of his and and walked towards the crashing waves, walking against the tide. She crinkled her toes, pressing them into the wet sand as she stood there, rocking backwards and forwards on the balls of her feet. Her hair blended perfectly with the setting sun in front of her, turning it a golden color.  
果然，明日香突然松开了他的手，走向汹涌的波浪，逆着潮水前行。她皱起脚趾，将它们压进湿润的沙子里，站在那里，脚尖前后摇摆。她的头发与前方落日的余晖完美融合，变成了金色。

"Hey Shinji..." "嘿，真嗣..."

"Hmmm?" "嗯？"

"I've been thinking recently...about a lot of things. About how happy I am with you, and its still hard for me to believe that we ended up together. We've been friends through our entire lives, and then we suddenly started dating, and got married, and then here we are."  
"我最近一直在想...很多事情。关于我有多幸福，和你在一起，这对我来说仍然难以置信。我们从小就是朋友，然后我们突然开始约会，结婚，然后我们就这样在一起了。"

Asuka turned towards him then, her head now blocking the sun.  
明日香这时转向他，她的头挡住了阳光。

"Everything seemed to have happened so fast, its hard to take everything in. But I want you to know that I love you...will always love you."  
“一切发生得太快，很难完全理解。但我想让你知道，我爱你……会永远爱你。”

Shinji blinked, not having a clue where she was going with this.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，完全不知道她要说什么。

"Though its been on my mind for a while, what your mom said earlier...well...kids..."  
"虽然这事在我心里盘旋了一阵子，但你妈妈之前说的...呃...孩子..."

Shinji blinked again... 真嗣又眨了眨眼...

"Kids?" asked a bewildered Shinji.  
"孩子？" 真嗣困惑地问道。

"Don't you think we should...discuss it? I mean...it came out of nowhere, and I never thought about it when I myself was young. But I'm in my twenties now, and what your mom said about Misato..."  
"你不觉得我们应该...讨论一下吗？我是说...这突然就冒出来了，我自己年轻时从未想过。但现在我二十多岁了，你妈妈提到美里的话..."

"Asuka...are you saying?"  
"明日香...你是说？"

"Well, what about it? Should we have kids?" asked Asuka.  
"那么，这事儿怎么说？我们应该要孩子吗？" 明日香问道。"

"...I don't know," said Shinji truthfully. "I've never thought about it much either...I mean...should we wait a little longer? Like...until we've settled down and I'm working."  
"...我不知道，" 真嗣如实说道。"我也从未多想过...我是说...我们应该再等等吗？比如...等到我们安定下来，我开始工作。"

"You're going to work and Nerv eventually right?"  
"你最终会去 NERV 工作，对吧？"

"Yeah, thats what I'm going to do most likely."  
"是的，很可能我会这么做。"

"Most likely? Shinji, I need a definite answer from you. This has to be something we agree upon, and I want our parents approval before we go through with this."  
"最有可能？真嗣，我需要你给我一个明确的答复。这件事我们必须达成一致，而且我希望在我们实施之前得到双方父母的同意。"

"Well, my mom seems ready whenever," smirked Shinji.  
"嗯，我妈妈似乎随时都准备好了，""真嗣微微一笑。

"I'm serious about this Shinji," mumbled Asuka. "I-I'm still unsure of myself, but also I'm...I'm scared and nervous. Raising a family, I've given never consideration to any of these things...but when I'm with you I-"  
"我是认真的，真嗣，""明日香低声说。""我-我对自己仍然不确定，但同时我也...我害怕和紧张。养家糊口，我从未考虑过这些事情...但和你在一起时，我-"

"Asuka," mumbled Shinji. "明日香，" 真嗣喃喃道。

Taking several steps out into the surf, Shinji stood in front of Asuka and wrapped her arms around her.  
真嗣踏出几步走进海浪中，站在明日香面前，将她拥入怀中。

"I don't know about this either...its confusing at this point what we want to do. But I'm happy when I'm with you, we've always been happy together. So...if having a kid would make us even happier, I think we should. Though...it'll be tough. I've never changed a diaper...have you?"  
"我也不太确定这件事……现在我们想要做什么已经变得很混乱了。但和你在一起时我很快乐，我们一直都很快乐。所以……如果有个孩子能让我们更幸福，我想我们应该这么做。不过……会很辛苦。我从来没换过尿布……你呢？"

"Once, when I was with Misato. It was rough."  
"有一次，我和美里在一起。那段时间很艰难。"

Asuka smiled slightly at that, while Shinji grinned back, holding her close against him.  
听到这话，明日香微微一笑，而真嗣则咧嘴回笑，紧紧地将她拥入怀中。

"Hey Shinji," said Asuka.  
"嘿，真嗣，" 明日香说道。

"Huh?" "啊？"

"I love you..." "我爱你..."

Shinji was rather taken aback at this, but responded anyway.  
真嗣对此颇为惊讶，但还是回应了。

"Asuka...I too, I- "Asuka...我也，我——

...I what? ...我什么？

Well, love of course. 当然是爱了。

"Shinji?" asked Asuka as she looked up at him.  
"真嗣？" 明日香抬头看着他问道。

'What was that?' wondered Shinji feeling bemused.  
'那是什么？' 真嗣感到困惑，心中纳闷。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Oh...sorry..." "哦...对不起..."

"Jeez, you're supposed to say you love me back," pouted Asuka.  
"哎呀，你应该回答你也爱我嘛，" 明日香嘟着嘴说道。

"Sorry..." “对不起……”

"You still apologize too much," laughed Asuka as she pressed her head against his chest.  
"你还是道歉太多了，" 明日香笑着把头靠在他的胸口。

"Hey...Shinji...kiss me..."  
"嘿...真嗣...吻我..."

Shinji did a double take at that, and looked down at Asuka.  
真嗣对此愣了一下，然后低头看向明日香。

"Why so suddenly?" “为什么这么突然？”

"Do I need a reason to receive a kiss from my husband?" asked Asuka while blushing slightly. It was all Shinji could do to not ravish her right there on the spot, but something held him back. What was it though.  
“我需要理由才能接受丈夫的吻吗？”明日香微微脸红地问道。真嗣差点就在当场把她拥入怀中，但某种东西阻止了他。那是什么呢？

"No, you don't," mumbled Shinji.  
"不，你不会的，" 真嗣咕哝道。

"Then kiss me," beamed Asuka as she looked up into his face, leaning close to. He didn't realize just how much taller he was than Asuka. But as there faces neared, her caught a sweet scent coming from her hair. Her cheeks were rosy red from the cold wind, while her lips were pink and he knew from experience, quite soft.  
"那就吻我吧，" 明日香笑着抬头看向他，身体靠近。他没有意识到自己比明日香高多少。但当他们的脸越来越近时，他闻到了她头发上散发出的甜美香气。她的脸颊因寒风而泛着玫瑰红，而她的唇瓣粉嫩，他凭经验知道，非常柔软。

Experience? What experience?  
经验？什么经验？

The wedding for instance.  
比如那场婚礼。

...What else though. ……除此之外呢。

That was just it...Shinji couldn't remember kissing her any other time.  
问题就在这里……真嗣记不起还在其他时候吻过她。

"Shinji?" asked Asuka as she breathed directly next to his cheek, tickling his skin softly. "Is something wrong?"  
"真嗣？" 明日香在他脸颊旁轻声问道，温暖的气息轻轻拂过他的皮肤，带来一丝痒意。"怎么了？有什么不对劲吗？"

"No..." mumbled Shinji. "Nothing is-"  
"没..." 真嗣含糊地咕哝着。"没什么-"

But it was. 但确实有事。

"-wrong." "-错了。"

"Then kiss me silly," laughed Asuka.  
"那就吻我到傻吧，"明日香笑着说。"

Something about this. Something about Asuka. About his mother...  
关于这个。关于明日香。关于他的母亲……

"What is it?" mumbled Shinji  
"这是什么？" 真嗣咕哝道

"...What?" asked Asuka, feeling confused now. She stopped leaning into Shinji and stepped back from him now, looking somewhat worried.  
"...什么？" 明日香感到困惑地问道。她停止了倚靠在真嗣身上，后退一步，看起来有些担忧。

"Whats wrong Shinji?" "怎么了，真嗣？"

Shinji looked around then; at the ocean; at the beach; at the sun; the trees; their house.  
真嗣环顾四周；望向海洋；沙滩；太阳；树木；还有他们的家。

...Something was wrong...  
……有些不对劲……

Everything was wrong. 一切都错了。

But Asuka was here...so did it really matter?  
但明日香在这里...这真的重要吗？

And he loved Asuka...he really did.  
他爱明日香...他真的爱她。

But-

'This isn't Asuka,' Shinji thought suddenly. 'Asuka isn't this kind and caring; Asuka isn't this beautiful; Asuka would never cook breakfast for me without me begging her first; Asuka wouldn't tell me she loves me; Asuka would never try to kiss me.'  
'这不是明日香，'真嗣突然想到。'明日香不会这么善良体贴；明日香不会这么美丽；明日香绝不会在我没央求她之前就为我做早餐；明日香不会对我说她爱我；明日香绝不会试图吻我。'

Then what is this? 那这是什么？

"Shinji?" asked the Asuka standing in front of him.  
“真嗣？”站在他面前的明日香问道。

What is this place? 这是什么地方？

"Shinji? Whats going on? Whats wrong! Shinji!"  
"真嗣？怎么了？出什么事了！真嗣！"

Shinji shuddered...remembering something...from long ago? No, recently...but it was painful, thats why he couldn't remember it. But he had to! It was important. It was important to him, because it related to her. But did he want to know? After all, this life wasn't so bad. Even if this Asuka is different, it isn't so bad. Everybody is nice to him, everything is simple. Nothing ever happens in this mundane life.  
真嗣颤抖着...想起了什么...很久以前的事？不，是最近...但那很痛苦，所以他记不清了。但他必须想起来！这很重要。对他来说很重要，因为它与她有关。但他想知道吗？毕竟，现在的生活并不糟糕。即使这个明日香不同，也没那么糟糕。每个人都对他很好，一切都很简单。这种平凡的生活中什么都不会发生。

But this isn't reality. 但这不是现实。

And this isn't my Asuka.  
这也不是我的明日香。

"Where is Asuka?" wondered Shinji out loud.  
“明日香在哪里？”真嗣大声自问。

"Wh-What are you talking about Shinji?" asked the Asuka in front of him.  
“什、你在说什么啊，真嗣？”他面前的明日香问道。

Shinji looked down at the Asuka in front of him, and was amazed that he could have been fooled by such a thing. It was too perfect, and thats what the problem had been.  
真嗣低头看着面前的明日香，惊讶于自己竟会被这样的事情所迷惑。它太完美了，而这正是问题的所在。

"I'm sorry," said Shinji, "but this isn't, not what I wanted. This reality, where I only matter. Everybody else is somewhere out there, but I didn't care."  
"对不起，"真嗣说，"但这不是，不是我想要的。这个现实，我唯一重要。其他人都不知道在哪里，但我不在乎。"

"Sh-Shinji...what are you-"  
"真-真嗣...你在干什-"

"Sorry," replied Shinji, "but I'm not being fooled by this anymore."  
"对不起，" 真嗣回答道，"但我不会再被这种事愚弄了。"

Turning around, he looked at a space directly into the side of cliff upon which there house had been built, and suddenly, an empty space appeared cut into the side of the cliff. It was black, with very little light, except for a dim glow.  
他转过身，看向悬崖侧面原本是他们房屋所在的位置，突然间，悬崖上出现了一个被切割出的空洞。里面一片漆黑，光线极其微弱，只有一丝昏暗的光芒。

Shinji walked over to this space and looked down into its depth. He couldn't see anything, but he guessed what was likely down there.  
真嗣走向这个空洞，低头望向深处。他什么也看不见，但他猜测下面可能有什么。

"What are you doing?" Asuka suddenly shouted behind him.  
"你在干什么？" 明日香突然在他身后大喊。

Shinji turned around and saw that she was crying. This was likely a final attempt to try and keep him there, but he wasn't buying it. After all...Asuka was-  
真嗣转过身来，看到她在哭泣。这可能是一次最后的尝试，试图让他留下来，但他并不买账。毕竟...明日香是——

"I'm sorry," mumbled Shinji. "I really am...but I don't belong here, and neither do you really. This place...this false reality...I think I understand it, and I'm ashamed of it. I was weak...Ironically, I did exactly what Lilith told me not to forget, and that was the lives of others affected by my decisions. I can't hear them though...and I need to fix that."  
"对不起，" 真嗣咕哝着。"我真的...很抱歉...但我并不属于这里，你也不真正属于这里。这个地方...这个虚假的现实...我想我理解了，我为此感到羞愧。我曾软弱...讽刺的是，我恰恰做了莉莉丝告诉我不该忘记的事，那就是我的决定影响了他人的生活。我听不到他们的声音...我需要去修正这一点。"

"I don't understand," whispered Asuka.  
"我不明白，"明日香低声说道。

"No...you wouldn't, since you are something that I desired...out of my selfishness, because I wanted to run away from it all. But not anymore..."  
"不……你不会明白的，因为你是我出于自私而渴望的……因为我想要逃避这一切。但不再这样了……"

Sighing, Shinji looked towards the black hole for a brief instance before making up his mind. Within that space, Lilith was waiting.  
叹了口气，真嗣朝黑洞望了一眼，随即下定决心。在那片空间里，莉莉丝正在等待。

Without a seconds thought, Shinji into the unknown.  
没有丝毫犹豫，真嗣踏入了未知。

And-

---

His eyes opened. 他的眼睛睁开了。

He was flat on his back, on what felt to be a sand like substance, but it was pale white. Pushing himself up, he looked around at his surroundings, but only several things were in his vision. The first, was that of a large decrepit tree with almost all its branches withered and rotted away. Around the tree was the ground, blackened with what appeared to be fire. The tree was on an island that was wrapped around by a small creak. But the creak seemed to have dried up long ago, leaving nothing left but the bones of the fish. However sitting in the middle of this island was Lilith.  
他平躺在地，感觉像是沙子，却是苍白的。他撑起身，环顾四周，视线中只有寥寥数物。首先映入眼帘的是一棵巨大的枯树，几乎所有枝条都已枯萎腐烂。树周围的土地被烧得焦黑。这棵树位于一个小岛中央，被一条小溪环绕。但溪水早已干涸，只剩下鱼骨。然而，在这座小岛中央，坐着莉莉丝。

Shinji stared at her for a few seconds, marveling at the change in her. She no longer looked like Asuka or Rei, but something closer to a shrine maiden. Lilith had a long flowing kimono that was pure white, along with white hair that reached to her waist.  
真嗣盯着她看了几秒钟，惊叹于她的变化。她不再像明日香或绫波，而是更像一位神社的巫女。莉莉丝穿着一件纯白色的长流袖和服，白发垂至腰间。

"I see you have awakened, Shinji," came Lilith's voice from very close to him. But the strange thing was, he cold still see here on the island.  
“看来你已经觉醒了，真嗣。”莉莉丝的声音从离他非常近的地方传来。但奇怪的是，他仍然能看到她在岛上。

"Yeah...I have," muttered Shinji as he stood up and looked at her.  
“嗯……是的。”真嗣咕哝着站起身来，看着她。

Lilith finally turned towards Shinji, and then he understood that she wasn't communicating with him verbally but that she was using her AT-field to resonate with his so that they could talk.  
莉莉丝终于转向真嗣，这时他才明白，她并非用言语与他交流，而是利用她的 AT 力场与他的共鸣，以便他们能够对话。

"I must say that I am impressed that you were able to escape that false reality, and without using your angel powers."  
“我得说，你能逃出那个虚假的现实，而且没有动用你的天使之力，这让我印象深刻。”

"I created it," Shinji mumbled. "It was mine to control."  
“那是我创造的，”真嗣低声说，“它由我来掌控。”

"True, very true. It was what you desired, and so, your desire was granted because of Third Impact."  
"确实，非常确实。那是你所渴望的，因此，你的愿望因第三次冲击而得以实现。"

"So then...its over?" "那么...一切都结束了？"

"The Tree of Life is withering away...so yes...it is."  
"生命之树正在枯萎...是的...结束了。"

Shinji stared at Lilith for a minute before he spoke, "Why did you do all this?"  
真嗣盯着莉莉丝看了一会儿，才开口问道：“你为什么要做这一切？”

Lilith blinked, momentarily surprised. "What are you talking about?" she asked oddly polite.  
莉莉丝眨了眨眼，一时有些惊讶。“你在说什么？”她奇怪地礼貌问道。

"Why did you lead me all this way, only to have me reject that false reality for one that is more painful than anything I could ever bare."  
“你为什么要引导我走这么远，只为让我拒绝那个虚假的现实，去接受一个比我能承受的任何痛苦都要更痛苦的真实。”

"But it was those memories of that girl that makes you desire the truth. As you realized, that Asuka is not the Asuka that you know. That Asuka was simply how you wished, or desired to see Asuka as, just as everybody else in that world was as you desired. A living mother, a father that, though he works, cares about you. Whatever you desired, the reality created. During your time there, new memories were constantly being created based on questions you asked. But it was your own defense against what the truth of it was. And that was that it was all false to begin with.  
但正是关于那个女孩的记忆，让你渴望真相。正如你所意识到的，那个明日香已非你所熟知的明日香。那个明日香只是你希望或渴望看到的模样，就像那个世界中的其他人一样，都是你心中所愿的投影。一个活着的母亲，一个虽然工作却关心你的父亲。无论你渴望什么，现实都会随之创造。在那里度过的时光中，新的记忆不断基于你提出的问题而生。但这只是你对抗真相本身的防御机制。而真相就是，这一切从一开始就是虚假的。

Lilith looked at the Tree of Life then and said, "This is the alternate dimensions sealed within the earth called the Garden of Eden. This is the plane in which the angels used to live, but you destroyed them, and now the branches are rotted and dead. The trunk will soon die, and then-"  
莉莉丝望着生命之树，然后说道：“这是被封印在大地之内的诸多次元，名为伊甸园。这是天使们曾经居住的层面，但你毁灭了他们，如今枝条已腐朽枯死。树干也将很快死去，然后——”

"And then what?" asked Shinji.  
“然后会怎样？”真嗣问道。

Lilith was silent for a while until she finally said.  
莉莉丝沉默了一会儿，最终说道。

"Everything will revert to LCL fluid...most likely, planet earth will cease to exist."  
“一切都将回归 LCL 之海……很可能，地球将不复存在。”

"And that is what you want?"  
“这就是你想要的吗？”

"I want to recreate the earth as I see fit, but the Tree of Life must be destroyed before that can happen."  
"我想要按照我的意愿重建地球，但在那之前，生命之树必须被摧毁。"

"And that is what you want?"  
"这就是你想要的吗？"

"It is," said Lilith as she stared at the dying tree.  
"是的，"莉莉丝说着，凝视着那棵濒死的树。

...

"Is that the truth?" asked Shinji.  
"那是真的吗？" 真嗣问道。

Lilith rounded on him. 莉莉丝转过身来面对他。

"What do you mean is that the truth! Why wouldn't it be!"  
"你什么意思，那是真的吗！为什么不是真的！"

Shinji shrugged and said, "Adam...or maybe I should say my father...he is angry with you, but he still pities you, maybe that is his way. But I think its true that you're lonely, and that you've been alone for too long. Your hatred of Adam and the angels brewed until you decided to destroy everything that you once loved.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，说道：“亚当……或许我该称他为我的父亲……他对你感到愤怒，但依然怜悯你，也许这就是他的方式。但我认为你确实孤独，而且已经孤独太久了。你对亚当和天使们的憎恨酝酿到你决定摧毁所有曾经珍爱的一切。”

"What would you know about that Shinji!" Lilith shouted at him.  
“你懂什么，真嗣！”莉莉丝朝他吼道。

"Being lonely? I know that better than anyone," mumbled Shinji.  
“孤独？我比任何人都清楚那种感觉，”真嗣喃喃自语。

"I tell you! I will destroy the Tree of Life and in its place set myself as the center piece of earth and recreate it as I see fit. All life will stem from me!"  
"我告诉你！我将摧毁生命之树，并在其位置上将自己作为地球的中心，按照我的意愿重新创造它。所有生命都将源自于我！"

"But you'll still be lonely," said Shinji.  
"但你仍然会感到孤独，" 真嗣说道。

"Shut up!" shouted Lilith as she sent her AT-field at him. But Shinji skillfully dodged.  
"闭嘴！" 莉莉丝大喊着向真嗣发出她的 AT 力场。但真嗣巧妙地躲开了。

Breathing heavily, Lilith said, "I should have just killed you back then, during Third Impact, but I was curious about you Shinji, curious what decision you would choose, and I was surprised to see that you chose this reality over the other."  
喘着粗气，莉莉丝说道：“我本该在第三次冲击时就杀了你，但那时我对你的选择感到好奇，真嗣，我想知道你会做出什么决定。看到你选择了这个现实而非另一个，我感到惊讶。”

"Don't be so surprised Lilith," said Shinji. "You killed Asuka...and I can't forgive you of that...but I do pity you, and not because of Adam, but because of myself. I pity you because I know that feeling of loneliness...but Asuka saved me from all that...and she also saved me again."  
“别那么惊讶，莉莉丝，”真嗣说，“你杀了明日香……我无法原谅你这一点……但我确实同情你，不是因为亚当，而是因为我自己。我同情你，因为我了解那种孤独的感觉……但明日香把我从那一切中拯救了出来……她又一次救了我。”

"What are you talking about?"  
“你在说什么？”

"Her voice...her voice brought me back from that reality."  
"她的声音...她的声音将我从那个现实中拉了回来。"

"Thats impossible," spat Lilith, "she's dead!"  
"那不可能，"莉莉丝啐道，"她已经死了！"

"Physically...yes. But within that sea of LCL fluid, Asuka is there somewhere. She has the strongest will out of anyone I have ever seen, and knows clearly who she is. She found herself in there, and called me back. I'm sure of it."  
"从生理上来说...是的。但在那 LCL 液体的海洋中，明日香一定还在某处。她拥有我所见过的最坚强的意志，并且清楚地知道自己是谁。她在那里找到了自己，并呼唤我回来。我确信这一点。"

"Shut Up!" shouted Lilith again as she sent her AT-field at Shinji, but this time, Shinji blocked it easily.  
“闭嘴！”莉莉丝再次大喊，向真嗣发出她的 AT 力场，但这次，真嗣轻松地挡住了它。

"Lilith...I want to talk to Ayanami..."  
“莉莉丝……我想和绫波谈谈……”

"...What?" "...什么？"

"I want to talk to Ayanami," repeated Shinji clearly. "So if you could-"  
“我想和绫波谈谈，”真嗣清晰地重复道，“所以如果你能——”

Lilith lashed out at him again, but Shinji ignored this, dodging the AT-field again.  
莉莉丝再次向他发起攻击，但真嗣对此置之不理，又一次躲开了 AT 力场。

"Why do you want to talk that useless, soulless-"  
“你为何要谈论那些无用、无魂的——”

"Because Ayanami will tell me," whispered Shinji. "Tell me what you don't want-"  
“因为绫波会告诉我，”真嗣低声说道，“告诉我你所不愿——”

Lilith suddenly disappeared from the island and appeared directly in front of Shinji, throwing he fist against him. Dodging around to the side, Shinji carelessly projecting his AT-field as Lilith swung around again, striking her fist against his AT-field. But Lilith seemed strangely underpowered here.  
莉莉丝突然从岛上消失，直接出现在真嗣面前，一拳向他挥去。真嗣侧身躲避，不经意间展开了 AT 力场，当莉莉丝再次转身挥拳时，她的拳头击中了他的 AT 力场。但在这里，莉莉丝似乎出奇地力不从心。

"You're forgetting Lilith," said Shinji. "That this is where the angel half of me would be the strongest. Though still human, I was born from Adam. "  
“你忘了莉莉丝，”真嗣说，“这里是我作为使徒那一半力量最强的地方。尽管我还是人类，但我是由亚当所生。”

"SHUT UP!" “闭嘴！”

Lilith's AT-field exploded outward around her, ripping apart the ground as it charged towards him. Frowning slightly, Shinji mumbled, "She isn't going to listen...is she..."  
莉莉丝的 AT 力场向外爆发，撕裂地面，向他冲去。微微皱眉，真嗣喃喃自语，“她不会听的……是吧……”

Resigning himself to what it was, he brought his right fist back and prepared to generate his AT-field for what he hoped was the last time.  
他无奈地接受了这个现实，将右拳收回，准备生成 AT 力场，希望这是最后一次。

**I've had this chapter in my mind for a while and in particular the false reality section. The big thing I had to keep in mine was, to not let the romance get too deep. Under no circumstances was a going to have Shinji say that he loved this fake Asuka, nor was he going to kiss her. I mean, this hasn't even happened in the true reality. (Sorta)  
这个章节在我脑海中酝酿已久，尤其是关于虚假现实的那个部分。我必须牢记的一点是，不能让感情戏过深。无论如何，我都不会让真嗣对假明日香说出“我爱你”，也不会让他们接吻。毕竟，这在真正的现实中都未曾发生过。（算是吧）**

**Anyway, enough rambling. Back to Christmas dinner.  
总之，闲话少说。回到圣诞晚餐上。**

### Chapter 34: Truth

**And Update...alright its been a while. Sorry about that everyone, but we are nearing the end.

---

Lilith's AT-field roared towards Shinji, cutting apart the rotted ground as it neared him. Reacting quickly, Shinji drew back his right arm, and projected his own AT-field in a dome around him. The two AT-fields collided, created a shockwave that shook the very foundations of the dimension they resided in. The two beings squared off against each other, waiting for the other to strike. Lilith's white kimono flowed behind her, but her features had changed. Her face was now twisted upward evilly and her eyes glowed blood red.  
莉莉丝的 AT 力场向真嗣咆哮而去，将腐朽的大地撕裂，逼近他。真嗣迅速反应，收回右臂，在自己周围投射出一个穹顶状的 AT 力场。两股 AT 力场相撞，产生了一股震撼这个维度根基的冲击波。两个存在对峙着，等待对方先出手。莉莉丝的白色和服在她身后飘动，但她的面容已经改变。她的脸现在邪恶地扭曲向上，眼睛闪烁着血红色的光芒。

Shinji stared at her for a second, his right arm careless at his side. He didn't want to have to fight her if he couldn't help it. But-  
真嗣盯着她看了一会儿，右臂随意地垂在身侧。如果不是迫不得已，他不想与她战斗。但是——

Lilith suddenly projected her AT-field forward, cutting Shinji's thoughts off.  
莉莉丝突然向前投射她的 AT 力场，打断了真嗣的思绪。

"What the hell do you know about me!" shouted Lilith as she continued attacking Shinji. "Who are you to know what I feel!"  
“你对我到底了解什么！”莉莉丝咆哮着，继续攻击真嗣。“你凭什么知道我的感受！”

Shinji was silent as he blocked Lilith's AT-field time and time again.  
真嗣沉默地一次次挡下莉莉丝的 AT 力场。

Lilith stopped however, and took several steps back, breathing heavily. Something seemed to be paining her.  
然而，莉莉丝停了下来，后退了几步，呼吸急促。似乎有什么在折磨着她。

"You creation of Adam! What the fuck could you possibly know about me!"  
"你这个亚当的造物！你他妈能懂我什么！"

"It has nothing to do with Adam!" Shinji shouted back at her.  
""这跟亚当无关！"" 真嗣朝她吼回去。

Projecting his AT-field in a wide arc, he swung it down towards Lilith. Lilith projected her AT-field over herself, and as the two AT-fields clashed, an explosion of bright white light ricochet around the battlefield, blinding the two momentarily. Shinji felt his eyes sting from the burst of light, but stood motionless, letting his other senses kick in, searching for Lilith; he was sure that she would take this opportunity to attack.  
"他将自己的 AT 力场呈扇形展开，向莉莉丝挥去。莉莉丝也在自己上方展开了 AT 力场，两股力场相撞，战场上一瞬间爆发出耀眼的白光，将两人暂时致盲。真嗣感到眼睛因强光而刺痛，但他依然纹丝不动，让其他感官接管，搜寻莉莉丝的踪迹；他确信她会趁此机会发动攻击。

Sure enough, he sensed a presence to his left and turned towards that way, just in time to see Lilith's white kimono lashing out at him. Shinji dove backwards as her AT-field soared towards him. Swinging his arm forward, Shinji projected his AT-field around himself, blocking Lilith's AT-field.  
果然，他感觉到左侧有动静，转身望去，正好看到莉莉丝的白色和服向他袭来。真嗣向后一跃，她的 AT 力场随之向他扑来。真嗣挥臂前推，将自己的 AT 力场展开，挡住了莉莉丝的 AT 力场。

"Damn you!" screeched Lilith from his right.  
“该死的！”莉莉丝从他右侧尖叫道。

Shinji turned again but wasn't quick enough this time. Lilith caught him off guard, but instead of attacking him with her AT-field like he thought she would, she punched him cleanly in the face, sending him reeling backwards and to the ground. Shinji had not expected this tactic from her. Moving fast though, Shinji rolled to his left just as her AT-field stabbed into the ground. Pushing himself upward, Shinji grabbed one of Lilith's arms and threw her over his shoulder. However, Lilith majestically corrected herself in midair, and landed easily on the ground.  
真嗣再次转身，但这次不够快。莉莉丝趁他不备，却没有像他预想的那样用 AT 力场攻击，而是干净利落地一拳打在他脸上，让他向后倒地。真嗣没想到她会用这种战术。尽管如此，真嗣迅速向左一滚，正好躲过她 AT 力场的突刺。他用力起身，抓住莉莉丝的一只手臂，将她甩过肩头。然而，莉莉丝在空中优雅地调整身姿，轻松落地。

Lilith stared at Shinji hatefully, hating him for everything that he was. But she also envied him in a way.  
莉莉丝憎恨地盯着真嗣，恨他的一切。但某种程度上，她也嫉妒他。

"Why do you exist?" asked Lilith suddenly.  
“你为什么存在？”莉莉丝突然问道。

Shinji stared back at her for a few seconds before he sigh and said, "Haven't I been asked that enough lately?"  
真嗣回视了她几秒钟，然后叹了口气说：“最近这个问题我还没被问够吗？”

"I don't care! Why do you exist? How is it that someone such as yourself, with Adam as your father can exist! You who have been shunned all your life and beaten down by people greater than you! How is it that you can still exist!"  
"我不在乎！你为何存在？像你这样，父亲是亚当的人，怎么可能存在！你一生被排斥，被比你强大的人打压！你怎么还能存在！"

Shinji was silent, his eyes glazed over as he thought about this. Yes, many times he had almost given up, but he had always continued pushing forward. Was it because of Asuka? That may very well be apart of it, but something more he thought. The human spirit itself was something that refused to give up, even in its most hopeless moments. Maybe that was the human side of him that refused to give up, while his angel half wanted him to give in and except all the pain and torment.  
真嗣沉默了，他的眼神空洞，思考着这个问题。是的，他多次几乎放弃，但他总是继续前进。是因为明日香吗？这可能是其中一部分原因，但他认为还有更多。人类的精神本身是一种拒绝放弃的东西，即使在最绝望的时刻。也许这就是他的人性部分，拒绝放弃，而他的天使部分则希望他屈服并接受所有的痛苦和折磨。

"I exist because I can," Shinji eventually said. "A future where I existed was something that I had never thought of after I discovered my angel half. I always assumed I would die somewhere along the line, and sometimes even searched death out. Part of that was my disassociation with Asuka, but part of that was just my own hopelessness over the situation. Why should I live? I am something which is an abomination, something that has no right to live. But that itself is my own selfishness. What about the others around me? How will they be affected by my death? Would my father and mother truly be pleased if I wanted to die?"  
"我存在，因为我能，" 真嗣最终说道。"一个我存在的未来，自从我发现自己的天使半身以来，我从未想过。我一直以为自己会在某个时刻死去，有时甚至主动寻求死亡。部分原因是与明日香的疏离，但部分原因是我对现状的绝望。我为何要活？我是令人憎恶的存在，没有生存的权利。但这本身就是我的自私。我周围的人呢？我的死亡会如何影响他们？如果我想要死去，我的父母真的会高兴吗？"

"But your father was a being beyond human comprehension, and your mother was a lost woman!"  
"但你的父亲是超越人类理解的存在，你的母亲则是一个迷失的女人！"

"They are may parents, and so they still care about me. I've talked to my mother a few times, and she still cares about me. As for my father...I'm sure he feels the same."  
"他们是我的父母，所以他们仍然关心我。我和母亲谈过几次，她依然关心我。至于我的父亲...我相信他也是同样的感觉。"

"Lilith, I don't want to die. I don't want anyone to die. I want to live my life with the person I love while my friends and family are around me. This world that you are creating, you claim it is for us Lilim, but in reality it is your own selfish wish. You only care about yourself now, whereas you used to care about things that could grow by there own devices."  
"莉莉丝，我不想死。我不希望任何人死去。我希望和我爱的人一起生活，周围有我的朋友和家人。你创造的这个世界，你声称是为了我们莉莉姆，但实际上这只是你自私的愿望。你现在只关心自己，而以前你关心的是那些能够自行成长的事物。"

"So what if I wish that! I deserve that after this centuries of-"  
"就算我希望那样又如何！经历了这么多世纪，我应该得到这个——"

"Don't go throwing everything else away for that!" shouted Shinji. "I should know what loneliness feels like, and I hate myself for getting caught up in that world that I created. Even if the world you create is repopulated by humans, nobody will be the same. Asuka won't be the Asuka I know. Misato won't be the same, and Rei won't be the same. Every human is unique in there own way, and can never be recreated. I don't want something like that...I've already experience it once before. Asuka in particular...her crudeness, her kindness...nothing could replace who she is."  
"不要为了那个抛弃一切！" 真嗣喊道。"我应该知道孤独的滋味，我讨厌自己被那个我创造的世界所困。即使你创造的世界重新住满了人类，也不会有人是一样的。明日香不会是我认识的明日香。美里不会一样，丽也不会一样。每个人都是独一无二的，永远无法被复制。我不想要那样的东西……我已经经历过一次了。尤其是明日香……她的粗鲁，她的善良……没有什么能取代她是谁。"

"Why should I care about one human out of billions?"  
"为什么我要在乎这数十亿人中的一个？"

"I do though," said Shinji with a slight smile. "Asuka is very important to me...more so than I care to admit."  
"但我确实在乎，" 真嗣微微一笑说，"明日香对我非常重要...比我愿意承认的还要重要。"

"You can't bring her back though, so why even try?"  
"但你无法让她回来，那为什么还要尝试呢？"

"I can though," said Shinji. "Third Impact happened because of the combination of Lilith and Adam; myself and yourself. I have a hand in this, but I shut out the truth by enclosing myself in that false reality. I was the catalyst that brought this all about, so I should also be able to reject Third Impact."  
"我确实可以做到，" 真嗣说道。"第三次冲击是因为莉莉丝和亚当的结合；我和你。我在这其中扮演了角色，但我通过封闭在那虚假的现实中掩盖了真相。我是引发这一切的催化剂，所以我应该也能拒绝第三次冲击。"

"I won't let you!" "我不会让你得逞的！"

"It is odd Lilith, how even at the end of everything, you had to rely on me, the offspring of Adam to bring you here."  
"真是奇怪啊，莉莉丝，即便在一切的尽头，你还是不得不依赖我，亚当的后代，带你来到这里。"

Lilith's rage suddenly erupted, and wings of light exploded out her back. The white kimono she had once worn was shredded to pieces. Her face no longer showed any human characteristics, and it was once again the facelessness of Lilith.  
莉莉丝的怒火突然爆发，光之翼从她背后炸裂而出。她曾穿过的白色和服被撕成了碎片。她的面容不再显露任何人类的特征，再次变回了无面之姿的莉莉丝。

She attacked Shinji in a blinded rage, her AT-field erupting in great torrent so that it split the ground. Great chasms opened up in the earth as her rage erupted forth. Shinji finally appreciated the difference in power between himself and Lilith.  
她在狂怒中向真嗣发起攻击，AT 力场如洪流般爆发，将地面撕裂。大地裂开巨大的裂缝，她的怒火喷涌而出。真嗣终于意识到了自己与莉莉丝之间的力量差距。

Lilith's AT-field broke off into several forms and rushed at Shinji. Dodging the first attack, Shinji was forced to block the second with his own AT-field, though the second one pierced into his left thigh, bringing him momentarily to the ground. Blood poured from the open wound, but very quickly, the wound started to close up as it regenerated. Shinji was still surprised at how far his regenerative powers had come.  
莉莉丝的 AT 力场分裂成数个形态，向真嗣冲去。真嗣躲过了第一次攻击，却不得不用自己的 AT 力场阻挡第二次，尽管第二次攻击刺穿了他的左大腿，使他暂时倒地。鲜血从开放的伤口中涌出，但很快，伤口开始愈合再生。真嗣仍对自身再生能力的进步感到惊讶。

Lilith yelled in fury as she sent wave after wave of her AT-field at Shinji, though Shinji didn't seem fazed by this in the least; he dodged or blocked each of them easily.  
莉莉丝愤怒地大喊，向真嗣一波接一波地释放她的 AT 力场，但真嗣似乎对此毫不在意；他轻松地躲闪或挡下了每一波攻击。

"Why are you smiling?" shouted Lilith as she continued attacking him.  
“你为什么在笑？”莉莉丝一边继续攻击一边喊道。

"Your stubbornness is actually reminding me about Asuka," smiled Shinji.  
“你的固执让我想起了明日香，”真嗣微笑着说。

"Don't compare me to that bitch!" roared Lilith as she swung both her arms down. Her AT-field turned into a spear similar to that of the Lance of Longinus and charged at Shinji. Shinji projected his own AT-field around him, and met the spear head on the. The two collided with each other, creating a blinding explosion. Shinji could feel the ground tremble beneath him as if it was in fear of the two beings fighting. The landscape was starting to look like a war had taken place.  
"别拿我和那个婊子比！" 莉莉丝咆哮着，双臂猛地挥下。她的 AT 力场化作一柄类似朗基努斯之枪的长矛，直冲向真嗣。真嗣在自己周围展开了 AT 力场，迎头撞上了长矛。两者相撞，爆发出刺眼的光芒。真嗣能感觉到脚下的地面在颤抖，仿佛在恐惧这两位战斗的存在。四周的景象开始变得如同经历过一场战争。

Standing up straight, Shinji looked through the cloud of dust to where Lilith stood, but realized too late that she had moved. Feeling a presence above him, Shinji looked up into the black sky devoid of stars and saw Lilith several feet above him, her AT-field rushing towards him. Shinji brought both his arms up, generating a dome around himself, blocking the AT-field.  
真嗣挺直身子，透过尘埃望向莉莉丝站立的地方，但意识到为时已晚，她已经移动了。感觉到头顶有动静，真嗣抬头望向那片没有星星的漆黑夜空，只见莉莉丝悬在几英尺高的空中，她的 AT 力场正朝他袭来。真嗣双臂一抬，在自己周围生成一个穹顶，挡住了 AT 力场。

Lilith landed on the ground, and rushed at Shinji again, attacking him from all sides, her AT-field attacking every inch of Shinji's. Shinji could feel his AT-field starting to break down, and dissipated it, jumping backwards as he did. Lilith charged after him, throwing out her AT-field towards.  
莉莉丝落地后，再次冲向真嗣，从四面八方攻击他，她的 AT 力场无孔不入地攻击着真嗣的每一寸。真嗣感觉到自己的 AT 力场开始崩溃，便将其散去，同时向后跳跃。莉莉丝紧追不舍，向着他释放出 AT 力场。

'This has gone on long enough,' thought Shinji.  
“这已经持续太久了，”真嗣心想。

Stopping suddenly in his tracks, Shinji turned towards the oncoming Lilith and swung his right arm down. Shinji AT-field exploded from within him, and rushed towards Lilith's own. Lilith's eyes widened as she saw this, and froze, stunned at this sudden turn of events. From her perspective, it seemed to her that Adam had come to thwart her plans. But as her vision changed, she saw Shinji only standing there, a calm look on his face.  
真嗣突然停下脚步，转向迎面而来的莉莉丝，猛地挥下右臂。真嗣的 AT 力场从他体内爆发，冲向莉莉丝的 AT 力场。莉莉丝的眼睛瞪大了，她被这突如其来的变故惊呆了。从她的视角看，似乎是亚当来阻挠她的计划。但当她的视野变化时，她只看到真嗣站在那里，脸上带着平静的表情。

"You bastard!" screamed Lilith as the two AT-fields collided.  
“你这混蛋！”莉莉丝尖叫着，两股 AT 力场碰撞在一起。

Almost instantly, Lilith felt herself get pushed back several inches; her AT-field was losing, losing to a weak human. Lilith's fury redoubled, and she attacked back with everything she had, pushing herself to the very limits. Why was she having such trouble over one boy? As she looked up though, and saw Shinji still standing there with his arm extended, she felt something waver inside of her. Was it Rei?  
几乎瞬间，莉莉丝感到自己被推后了几英寸；她的 AT 力场正在失守，输给了一个弱小的人类。莉莉丝的怒火倍增，她用尽全力反击，逼迫自己达到极限。为何她会因为一个男孩而如此困扰？然而，当她抬头望去，看到真嗣仍然站在那里，手臂伸向前方，她内心某处感到了动摇。是绫波吗？

Shinji easily shattered Lilith's AT-field then, and stood motionlessly, staring at Lilith.  
真嗣轻易地粉碎了莉莉丝的 AT 力场，然后静静地站立，凝视着莉莉丝。

"Why," mumbled Lilith. "Why are you impeding me?"  
“为什么，”莉莉丝喃喃自语，“你为什么要阻挠我？”

"I'm not losing Asuka," mumbled Shinji.  
"我不会失去明日香的，" 真嗣喃喃道。

"Its Adam, isn't it! He's telling you to stop me!"  
"是亚当，对吧！他在告诉你阻止我！"

"Adam isn't telling me anything anymore," said Shinji with a sigh. "He's decided not to interfere anymore, for better or for worse."  
"亚当不再告诉我任何事了，" 真嗣叹息道，"他决定不再干涉，无论是好是坏。"

"Then that girl? Only for that girl you would go this far?"  
"那么那个女孩呢？仅仅为了那个女孩，你就愿意做到这一步吗？"

"Not simply for her...but for everyone as well. They deserve it. Many people had nothing to even do with Nerv, or the angels; so what about them? Is it fair to take there life away? That isn't what I believe."  
"不仅仅是为了她……也是为了所有人。他们值得。许多人甚至与 NERV 或使徒无关；那么他们呢？夺走他们的生命公平吗？那不是我所相信的。"

"You don't even know what awaits you! So how can you be so optimistic."  
"你甚至不知道前方有什么在等着你！你怎么能如此乐观。"

"I have to be, because I don't know myself to where I'll go after this is all over. What the state of earth is, or whether everyone will even be able to return."  
"我必须这样，因为我不知道这一切结束后我会去往何方。地球的状态如何，或者大家是否还能回来。"

Lilith grimaced at him, but didn't move. Something within her seemed to battling itself.  
莉莉丝对他皱了皱眉，但没有动。她内心似乎在自我斗争。

"What will you do Lilith?" asked Shinji.  
"你会怎么做，莉莉丝？" 真嗣问道。

"What can I possibly do?" shouted Lilith. "You take away everything from me and expect me to just be okay with that?"  
"我能做什么呢？" 莉莉丝喊道。"你夺走了我的一切，还期望我能坦然接受？"

"What did I take away from you that you had?" asked Shinji. "You never had anything in the first place; you gave all that up a long time ago."  
"我夺走了你什么？" 真嗣问道。"你本来就一无所有；很久以前你就已经放弃了所有。"

"I created you humans, and gave you the knowledge to live, so I can take back what is mine then!"  
"我创造了你们人类，赋予了你们生存的知识，所以我可以收回属于我的东西！"

"You won't do that," said Shinji as he started walking towards Lilith. "Or I should say Ayanami won't allow that."  
"你不会那么做的，" 真嗣说着开始向莉莉丝走去。"或者我应该说，绫波不会允许那样。"

"What are you-" "你这是要干什么-"

"I know Lilith, that Ayanami is simply a body created from you to heal Gendo of his hurt over losing my mother, but she managed to develop her own self. It must be difficult having to warring minds argue. Ayanami was always quiet, but very resolute in her decision. She wont budge an inch, and in order to be complete, you need her."  
"我了解莉莉丝，那个绫波只是由你创造出来治愈我父亲因失去我母亲而受伤的身体，但她成功地发展出了自己的自我。两个争斗的意识在体内争论，一定很困难。绫波总是沉默寡言，但她在决定上非常坚定。她不会退让半步，而为了完整，你需要她。"

"I don't need her, or anything else!"  
"我不需要她，或者其他任何东西！"

"But she is still a part of you, and without that, you are incomplete. Lilith, let me talk to Ayanami. I don't want to force her out if possible, but I will if you force me."  
"但她仍然是你的部分，没有她，你就不完整。莉莉丝，让我和绫波谈谈。我不想在可能的情况下强迫她离开，但如果你逼我，我会这么做。"

"I'd like to see you try."  
"我倒想看看你试试。"

"Lilith, you should know very well by now that I am capable of that. You on the other hand poured yourself into so many things that you have lost much of your power. The Evangelions, Ayanami, Third Impact, it has taken its toll on you. You are not as powerful as you used to be, and I would not have much difficulty extracting Ayanami from within you."  
"莉莉丝，你现在应该很清楚我有这个能力。而你，投身于太多事物，已经失去了许多力量。EVA，绫波，第三次冲击，这些都让你付出了代价。你不再像以前那样强大，要从你体内提取绫波对我来说不会太难。"

"Why do you even want to talk with her?"  
"你为什么还想和她说话？"

"To confirm things which you will not tell me."  
"为了确认一些你不会告诉我的事情。"

Lilith was silent for several seconds until she said, "Why did I ever interact with you."  
莉莉丝沉默了几秒钟，然后说道：“我当初为什么要和你打交道。”

"It was your own decision, and now you have to live by it. But...I think I learned things from you that I would never have learned on my own...and for that I have to thank you. You killed Asuka, and for that I can never forgive you, nor do I have any remorse for you. But Ayanami is still with you, so I can't bring myself to kill you."  
“这是你自己的决定，现在你必须承担后果。但是……我想我从你身上学到了一些我独自一人永远学不到的东西……为此我必须感谢你。你杀了明日香，对此我永远无法原谅你，也对你没有任何悔意。但绫波还在你身边，所以我无法狠心杀你。”

"Hmph, do what you please then," said Lilith. "But by no means am I done with you Shinji."  
“哼，随你便吧，”莉莉丝说，“但别以为我会就此罢休，真嗣。”

"Bring Ayanami out then."  
"那就带绫波出来吧。"

"...Fine." "……好吧。"

Lilith's face suddenly changed; her hair grew slightly, and her face changed to that of Rei, but she still had the same eyes.  
莉莉丝的脸色突然一变；她的头发微微长长，面容变成了绫波的样子，但眼神依旧未变。

"Ikari-kun," whispered Rei.  
"碇君，" 绫波低声说道。

"Sorry about calling you like this," mumbled Shinji as he scratched the back of his head.  
"抱歉这么突然叫你出来，" 真嗣挠着后脑勺咕哝道。

"...No, its okay," said Rei as she shook her head. "You had something you wanted to ask me?"  
"...不，没关系，" 绫波摇了摇头说。"你有什么想问我的吗？"

"Yes, and I suppose I should get it over with before Lilith returns. Ayanami...where is Asuka...and everyone?"  
"是的，我想我应该在莉莉丝回来之前解决这件事。绫波...明日香...还有大家在哪里？"

"...Do you want to see?" asked Rei after a moments pause.  
"...你想看看吗？" 绫波停顿片刻后问道。

"I do," nodded Shinji. "我想，" 真嗣点头道。

"I have to tell you this first though Shinji, even if Third Impact is avoided as you wish it...not everyone may comeback."  
"不过，真嗣，我得先告诉你，即便如你所愿避免了第三次冲击...并非所有人都能回来。"

"I know, I was prepared for that."  
"我知道，我早有准备。"

"Ultimately, it will be everyones decision whether they chose the false reality that was offered to them, or the world as it is."  
"最终，选择虚幻的现实还是真实的世界，将由每个人自己决定。"

"So then...I wasn't the only one who accepted the false reality?"  
"那么...我不是唯一一个接受了那个虚假现实的人？"

"No, you weren't. You were the first one to accept it, and afterwards, people started accepting it as well, though you were the only person to wake up from it. Some however, didn't chose the false reality, and so became as everyone else...LCL fluid. Though there are those of course that died before Third Impact."  
"不，你不是。你是第一个接受它的，之后人们也开始接受它，尽管你是唯一一个从中醒来的。但有些人没有选择那个虚假的现实，于是变成了和其他人一样的...LCL 液体。当然，也有一些人在第三次冲击之前就死了。"

"What happens to them?" asked Shinji.  
"他们会有什么下场？" 真嗣问道。"

"I am not sure. Lilith may know, but won't say."  
"我不确定。莉莉丝可能知道，但不会说。"

"What about Asuka though? Is she-"  
"那明日香呢？她还好吗？"

"She is fine, though trapped with everyone else within the Black Egg of Lilith that didn't chose the false reality."  
"她还好，只是和其他人一样被困在莉莉丝的黑卵中，没有选择虚假的现实。"

"The Black Egg buried under Tokyo-3?"  
"埋在东京-3 地下的黑色巨蛋？"

"Correct, the earth now is-"  
"没错，现在地球是——"

Shinji felt his feet suddenly leave solid ground, and felt his body moving at speeds unfathomable by the human mind. All to suddenly though, he felt himself crash into something, or was that just what he felt?  
真嗣突然感到双脚离开了坚实的大地，身体以人类难以理解的速度移动。但突然间，他感觉自己撞上了什么东西，还是那只是他的感觉？

Shinji looked around him and felt a familiar setting; he was back inside the entry plug of Unit 01.  
真嗣环顾四周，感到一种熟悉的氛围；他又回到了初号机的插入栓内。

"...What is this?" wondered Shinji.  
“……这是什么？”真嗣疑惑道。

"Where your body is," said Rei.  
“你的身体所在之处，”绫波说。

Shinji turned to his left and saw that Rei was kneeling beside him in the entry plug of Unit 01. She was wearing her own entry plug suit now.  
真嗣转向左侧，看到丽正跪在初号机的插入栓旁。她现在穿着自己的插入栓服。

"Your mind had traveled to the false reality while your body remained here. Since Lilith still needed the DNA of Adam to initiated Third Impact, she sectioned off your body from your mind and let it wander free, much as she did during that activation test of yours. Though when you escaped from the false reality, your mind traveled to the Garden of Eden where Lilith was."  
你的意识曾游离至那个虚假的现实，而身体却留在此处。由于莉莉丝仍需亚当的 DNA 来启动第三次冲击，她将你的身体与意识分离，任其自由游荡，正如她在你那次激活测试中所做的那样。然而当你逃离虚假现实时，你的意识来到了莉莉丝所在的伊甸园。

Shinji looked out from the entry plug of Unit 01, to the earth below. The entire earth had turned a dark red color as though the entire planet had died, and Shinji viewed all this from space. Unit 01 had been impaled with the Lance of Longinus and had fused with Lilith. A swirling vortex formed around the earth, everything seeming to meet in the center of where Lilith's arms where. A black sphere was floating there unsupported as humanity continued to turn into LCL fluid.  
真嗣从初号机的插入栓向外望去，俯瞰着下方的地球。整个地球已变成暗红色，仿佛整个星球已死，而真嗣正从太空中目睹这一切。初号机被朗基努斯之枪贯穿，与莉莉丝融合。一个旋转的漩涡围绕地球形成，万物似乎都在莉莉丝手臂所在的中点汇聚。一个黑色的球体悬浮在那里，不受支撑，而人类继续转化为 LCL 液体。

Shinji looked to his left and right and saw the true body of Lilith floating there. Wings had grown out of her back and the face seemed to have also changed back to Rei. The twelve Mass Produced Eva Units floated like a crown above her head, each of them impaled by one of fake Lances of Longinus.  
真嗣左右环顾，看到了漂浮在那里的莉莉丝的真身。她的背后长出了翅膀，面容似乎也变回了绫波。十二台量产型 EVA 机体像王冠一样悬浮在她的头顶，每台都被一支伪朗基努斯之枪贯穿。

"...Asuka is...there?" said Shinji as he pointed to the black sphere in Lilith's hands.  
“……明日香在那里吗？”真嗣指着莉莉丝手中的黑色球体问道。

"Yes, that is likely where she is, but you can't get there yet."  
“是的，她很可能就在那里，但你现在还无法到达。”

"...I know," mumbled Shinji painfully. He wanted nothing more than to be with Asuka again, but in order to do that, he had other things to deal with.  
"...我知道，" 真嗣痛苦地咕哝着。他最渴望的就是再次与明日香在一起，但为了实现这个愿望，他还有其他事情要处理。

"Ayanami...is it my fault that things have come to this? I destroyed the angels before, and now the Tree of Life is almost dead."  
"绫波...这一切都是我的错吗？我之前消灭了使徒，现在生命之树也几乎枯萎了。"

"The angels did there duty to serve the tree and destroy humanity if it came to that, you did what you had to to protect the people you cared for. You are not in the wrong."  
"使徒们尽职守护着生命之树，必要时也会毁灭人类，而你为了保护你在乎的人，做了你必须做的事。你没有错。"

"But what can I do to fix all this?"  
"但我要怎么做才能解决这一切呢？"

Rei was silent for several seconds before she said, "You want to reject Third Impact, but in order to do that properly, you must either kill Lilith, or convince her otherwise."  
绫波沉默了几秒钟后说道：“你想阻止第三次冲击，但为了正确地做到这一点，你必须要么杀死莉莉丝，要么说服她改变主意。”

"I won't kill her, because that would kill you as well."  
“我不会杀她，因为那也会杀了你。”

"Ikari-kun...you should know very well what will happen to me either way at the end of this."  
"碇君...你应该很清楚，无论怎样，最终我都会面临同样的结局。"

"I can't accept that!" "我无法接受这一点！"

"Then you can become like everyone else; the exact same."  
"那么你可以变得和大家一样；完全相同。"

Shinji was silent, thinking about his course of action. He didn't want to kill Lilith, but he couldn't give up on Asuka and everyone else.  
真嗣沉默了，思考着他的行动方针。他不想杀死莉莉丝，但他也不能放弃明日香和大家。

"Ayanami?" “绫波？”

"Yes?" “是？”

"Lilith has been lonely for a long time now...correct?"  
“莉莉丝已经孤独很久了……对吧？”

"...Yes..." "...是的..."

"Why is she doing what she is doing?"  
"她为什么要这么做？"

"...You should have already guessed Ikari-kun."  
"...你应该已经猜到了，碇君。"

'So I was right,' thought Shinji sadly. In the end, Lilith just wanted to be recognized again, even if it came to this.  
“所以我猜对了，”真嗣悲伤地想。最终，莉莉丝只是想再次被认可，即便走到了这一步。

"Adam won't budge though," said Shinji. "He's leaving me to decide what happens next."  
“亚当不会让步的，”真嗣说。“他让我来决定接下来会发生什么。”

"Is that so?" asked Rei.  
“是吗？”绫波问道。

"Yeah...I think he has already...moved on. Humans can do what they please, and since his angels have also died, he has no reason to stay here any longer. But Lilith is-"  
"是啊...我想他已经...继续前进了。人类可以随心所欲，而且既然他的天使们也都死了，他没有理由再留在这里了。但莉莉丝她——"

"Still holding on," mumbled Rei.  
"还在坚持，"丽低声说道。

"Yeah," sighed Shinji. "嗯，"真嗣叹了口气。

Looking down at the black sphere, Shinji tried to find Asuka within it, but everybody's AT-fields had blended together that it was near impossible to find one individual out of millions.  
低头看着那颗黑色球体，真嗣试图在其中找到明日香，但每个人的 AT 力场已经融合在一起，要从数百万中找出一个人几乎是不可能的。

'But she's there,' thought Shinji, 'and she's waiting impatiently for me as well.' This thought made him smile slightly.  
‘但她就在那里，’真嗣心想，‘而且她也在不耐烦地等着我。’这个念头让他微微一笑。

Turning back to Rei, he said, "I think I've seen enough. I'm ready to go back to the Garden of Eden."  
他转回对绫波说：“我想我已经看够了。我准备好回到伊甸园了。”

"When we return, Lilith will take control again," said Rei. "Is that what you want."  
"当我们回来时，莉莉丝会再次掌控一切，"丽说。"这就是你想要的吗？"

"Its fine," nodded Shinji. "My quarrel is with her, not you after all. And Ayanami..."  
"没关系，"真嗣点头道。"我的争执是与她，而非你。还有，绫波..."

"Yes?" “是？”

"Thank you...and this is, likely goodbye, isn't it?"  
"谢谢你...这很可能就是永别了，对吧？"

Rei stared back at Shinji for several seconds until she nodded once.  
丽盯着真嗣看了几秒钟，然后轻轻点了下头。

"Ayanami...I..." “绫波...我...”

But Rei shushed him by placing a finger of hers over his lips.  
但丽用手指轻轻按在他的唇上，示意他安静。

"Don't worry about me, I'll be okay, and Asuka is waiting for you."  
"别担心我，我会没事的，明日香还在等你呢。"

Shinji blinked, momentarily surprised.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，一时有些惊讶。

"Since when have you called her Asuka?"  
"你什么时候开始叫她明日香了？"

But Rei just waved at him, before tapping him lightly on the head. Once again, Shinji felt his body moving at speeds unfathomable...though it wasn't really his body he supposed.  
但丽只是向他挥了挥手，然后轻轻地敲了敲他的头。又一次，真嗣感觉到自己的身体以难以想象的速度移动...虽然这并不是他真正的身体。

Shinji felt his feet hit the ground and was momentarily disoriented. Looking around though, he felt his equilibrium mellow out, and saw Lilith standing there, no longer Rei. She watched him silently, but Shinji could feel the killing intent radiating from her. She wasn't about to stop yet.  
真嗣感觉到自己的脚触到了地面，一时间感到有些晕眩。但环顾四周后，他的平衡感逐渐恢复，看到了站在那里的莉莉丝，不再是丽。她静静地注视着他，但真嗣能感受到从她身上散发出的杀意。她还没有打算停下来。

"Lilith, wait a second." “莉莉丝，等一下。”

"Why should I? You had your talk as I allowed you."  
"我为什么要这么做？我已经让你说了你想说的，不是吗？"

"I don't want to fight you anymore. I'm tired of all this."  
"我不想再和你打了。我已经厌倦这一切了。"

"So then just die all ready!" shouted Lilith as she rushed towards Shinji. But Shinji his ground with moving an inch until he shouted-  
"那就快点去死吧！" 莉莉丝喊着冲向真嗣。但真嗣纹丝不动，直到他大喊——

"Adam has moved on!" “亚当已经放下了！”

Lilith froze in her tracks, her eyes wavering. Adam had moved on? What the hell was that supposed to mean?  
莉莉丝停下脚步，眼神动摇。亚当放下了？这到底是什么意思？

"What do you mean he has moved on?"  
“你说他放下了是什么意思？”

"He no longer cares about earth," said Shinji. "And the Lilim he has decided to let be."  
"他不再关心地球了，" 真嗣说。"至于那些莉莉姆，他决定任其自生自灭。"

Lilith narrowed her eyes into slits; she was confused about this sudden change.  
莉莉丝眯起了眼睛；她对这突如其来的变化感到困惑。

"So what are you saying? That since Adam is no longer here, I am supposed to just pack up and leave? Fuck that! Earth is mine then if he no longer cares about it, and I will claim it as such."  
"你这是什么意思？既然亚当不在这里了，我就该收拾东西走人？去他妈的！既然他不再关心地球，那它就是我的了，我会将其据为己有。"

"Lilith, isn't this enough already? Everything...everything was all for the sake of being recognized again, even it was by hatred. You didn't care what it took, as long as Adam looked at you again."  
"莉莉丝，这还不够吗？一切...一切都是为了再次被认可，哪怕是出于恨意。你不在乎手段，只要亚当再次注视你。"

"Shut Up!" yelled Lilith as she cut the air with her AT-field. She easily dodged this and stared back at her, pitying what she had become.  
"闭嘴！" 莉莉丝用她的 AT 力场划破空气吼道。她轻松躲开，回望着她，对她如今的模样感到怜悯。

"Lilith...I had always wondered why you had such an interest in me, and part of me understands that because you needed me to initiate your version of Third Impact, but it was also out of curiosity. I was born from a human and Adam, something which is itself strange. But you were jealous because it was my mother that Adam loved. I don't know if you had watched me since before we first met, but I knew that you were curious about the powers I may possess. But why were you so curious? Was it because you saw Adam within me, or that you wished to make Adam suffer through me? I have no idea really."  
"莉莉丝...我一直好奇你为何对我如此感兴趣，部分原因我理解，因为你需要我启动你的第三次冲击版本，但也出于好奇。我是人类与亚当的产物，这本身就很奇特。但你嫉妒，因为亚当爱的是我的母亲。我不知道你是否从我们初次见面之前就开始观察我，但我知道你对我的力量感到好奇。但你为何如此好奇？是因为你在我身上看到了亚当的影子，还是你想通过我来让亚当受苦？我真的不知道。"

"Thats bullshit!" "这简直是胡说八道！"

"Is it? I don't know," shrugged Shinji. "But Adam is gone, and whether he accomplished what he wanted, I have no idea. He had his own plans for me, but he seemed to have dropped them somewhere along the way. He has moved on, and I have no idea as to where. So then why Lilith? Why would you remain here when the person you love is-"  
"是吗？我不确定，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"但亚当已经消失了，至于他是否达成了他的目的，我一无所知。他原本对我有自己的计划，但似乎在某个时刻放弃了。他已经继续前行，而我完全不知道他去了哪里。那么为什么是莉莉丝？当你所爱的人已经——"

"SHUT UP!" roared Lilith as she clutched her head in agony. Everything that this body was saying, everything...  
"闭嘴！" 莉莉丝咆哮着，痛苦地抱住头。这个身体所说的一切，一切...

"Lilith," whispered Shinji, "lets stop this. I don't think you ever wanted to destroy earth, you only wanted recognition from Adam. But instead, at least I think, he used me to get through to you, and once he saw your state, he gave up. Maybe he thought there was something still left within you that he could care about...but now, after all his children have gone, he as left."  
"莉莉丝，" 真嗣低声说道，"我们停下来吧。我觉得你从未真正想要毁灭地球，你只是渴望得到亚当的认可。但相反，至少我认为，他是通过我来与你沟通，当他看到你的状态后，他放弃了。也许他认为你内心深处还有他可以关心的地方……但现在，在他所有的孩子们都离去后，他也离开了。"

"I don't care, I don't care," mumbled Lilith as she shook her head. "Everything can just burn away."  
"我不在乎，我不在乎，" 莉莉丝喃喃自语，摇着头。"一切都可以就这样烧毁。"

"Would you do that to this planet which you cared about so much?"  
"你会对这颗你曾经如此珍爱的星球做出这样的事吗？"

Lilith didn't answer, as tears started to come from her eyes. Her face was no longer featureless, and she had reverted to that of a shrine maiden.  
莉莉丝没有回答，泪水开始从她的眼中涌出。她的脸不再是无特征的，而是变回了神社巫女的样子。

"The feeling of being alone for all those years...it must have been hard," said Shinji. "I know what loneliness is like, but never could I imagine feeling that for centuries. I'm lucky for what I've found, and I don't intend to let it go."  
“那些年独自一人的感觉...一定很艰难吧，”真嗣说道。“我知道孤独的滋味，但我无法想象那种感觉持续了几个世纪。我很幸运找到了我所拥有的，而且我不打算放手。”

Lilith looked up at Shinji then, her face contorted with confusion, sadness, and anger. Everything that Shinji had said, she was having trouble denying it, since-  
莉莉丝抬头看着真嗣，她的脸上交织着困惑、悲伤和愤怒。真嗣所说的一切，她难以否认，因为——

"What do you want to do Shinji?" asked Lilith suddenly.  
"你想做什么，真嗣？" 莉莉丝突然问道。

"Myself? Well...I suppose I would like to hold Asuka in my arms right now and never let go of her again. Afterwards...probably see Misato and Ritsuko, Touji, Kensuke, and Hikari. Ayanami though..." Shinji trailed of here, unwilling thinking about Rei.  
"我自己？嗯...我想我现在想紧紧抱住明日香，再也不放开她。之后...可能会去见美里、律子、东治、健介和光。至于绫波...真嗣在这里停了下来，不愿再想绫波。

"But I want to do many things," he continued. "So many that I wouldn't know where to start. But with all of them, I want to experience with Asuka. Its strange, because even though we know each other so well, we still don't really. We haven't shared much with each other yet. Birthdays, Christmas; so many things I want to do with her."  
"但我有很多想做的事，" 他继续说道。"多到我不知道从何开始。但无论做什么，我都想和明日香一起体验。很奇怪，因为尽管我们彼此了解，却仍未真正了解。我们还没有分享过很多东西。生日、圣诞节；有太多的事情我想和她一起做。

"Do realize what you are saying though?" asked Lilith. "Third Impact has been initiated and everything has reverted to the soup of life. Asuka's consciousness is-"  
"你真的明白你在说什么吗？" 莉莉丝问道。"第三次冲击已经启动，一切都回归到了生命之汤的状态。明日香的意识是——"

"She's there though, waiting for me," smiled Shinji slightly. "And I'm sure she'll beat me half to death after this."  
"但她还在那里，等着我，" 真嗣微微一笑。"我相信她之后会把我打个半死。"

Lilith frowned at Shinji, before letting out a low sigh and standing up to her full height. "I'm beginning to understand why I tested you as I did, though I think I always understood."  
莉莉丝皱眉看着真嗣，随后轻轻叹了口气，站起身来。"我开始明白为什么我会那样考验你，尽管我想我一直以来都明白。"

"What?" "什么？"

"The connection between yourself and that girl...it reminded me of myself and Adam in the days of our youth. The mistakes that we made...that I made, I wanted to see how the two of you would fair. It was surprising though, that humans could love each other such as you two do."  
"你和那个女孩之间的联系...让我想起了我和亚当年轻时的日子。我们犯下的错误...我犯下的错误，我想看看你们俩会如何应对。不过，令人惊讶的是，人类竟然能像你们俩那样相爱。"

"It is not like that for all humans though," said Shinji.  
"但并非所有人类都是那样，" 真嗣说道。"

"I know. In your entirety, you're a despicable race which deserves to be destroyed, though for that I must take blame for. Showing the Lilim the Black Egg was a mistake on my part, and Adam has never forgiven me for it."  
"我知道。从整体来看，你们是一个可鄙的种族，理应被毁灭，尽管对此我也必须承担责任。向莉莉姆展示黑色巨卵是我犯下的错误，而亚当从未原谅我这一点。"

"Maybe he will though," shrugged Shinji.  
“也许他会吧，”真嗣耸了耸肩。

"No, he will never forget it," said Lilith as she looked up at the sky. She was silent for a few seconds as she looked up at the black sky, until she looked back at Shinji and asked-  
“不，他永远不会忘记，”莉莉丝抬头望着天空说道。她沉默了几秒钟，凝视着漆黑的天空，直到她转头看向真嗣，问道——

"Adam, your father, I had wondered it before, because I have felt his presence more than once, but was he with you today?"  
“亚当，你的父亲，我之前就曾疑惑过，因为我多次感受到他的存在，但今天他和你在一起吗？”

"...I believe so," shrugged Shinji. "He never gave reasons as to why he did what he did, but he also helped me along the way until I could handle things my own. In a way, he was acting as a parent should, though whether that was his intention, I don't know. I talked to him before Third Impact though, and understood that he was leaving."  
"...我相信是的，" 真嗣耸了耸肩。"他从没解释过为什么做那些事，但他也一直在帮助我，直到我能自己处理问题。从某种程度上说，他像一个父母应该做的那样，尽管我不知道这是否是他的本意。不过，在第三次冲击之前我跟他谈过，我知道他要离开了。"

"I thought so," smirked Lilith. "He was always interfering with my plans though." Lilith seemed to brighten slightly at this thought.  
"我也这么想，" 莉莉丝微微一笑。"但他总是干涉我的计划。" 想到这里，莉莉丝似乎稍微振奋了一些。

"Lilith..." asked Shinji.  
"莉莉丝..." 真嗣问道。

"Yes?" “是？”

"What will you do now?"  
"你现在打算怎么办？"

"What will I do?" blinked Lilith. "I haven't thought about that much honestly. Do I chase after him...or not? I can't decide. You are right though...I love the earth very much, but honestly don't have control over the growth of living things anymore. The Tree of Life is that which governs the earth, and if it dies-"  
"我该怎么办？"" 莉莉丝眨了眨眼。""老实说，我还没怎么想过。我是该追上去...还是不追？我无法决定。不过你说得对...我非常爱这片大地，但说实话，我已经无法控制生物的生长了。生命之树才是地球的统治者，如果它死了——"

"But isn't that my fault for killing the angels?" asked Shinji.  
""但那不是因为我杀了天使吗？"" 真嗣问道。

"Not true. The angels governed certain aspects of nature correlating to the branches of the tree. True, when the angel was killed, the branch it governed withered, but the tree still had a chance to regrow. The ultimate fault must lie with humans, because they have steadily polluted the earth."  
"并非如此。天使们掌管着与生命之树分支相关的自然界某些方面。确实，当天使被杀时，其所掌管的分支会枯萎，但生命之树仍有重生的机会。最终的过错必须归咎于人类，因为他们一直在持续污染地球。"

"But it can regrow?" "但它能重生吗？"

"Yes, but only if given the time, and it may take several years."  
"是的，但前提是给予足够的时间，这可能需要数年。"

Shinji looked at Lilith, wishing that he could believe what she said to be true, but-  
真嗣看着莉莉丝，希望自己能相信她所说的话是真的，但是——

"What will the earth...be like until then?"  
“在那之前，地球会变成什么样？”

"A ruin," answered Lilith simply. "Mankind has been brought to its knees by Third Impact, so the infrastructure may take time to rebuild. Animals and plants will be the same as usual, but will start to take dominion if the Lilim do not claim there place again."  
“一片废墟，”莉莉丝简单地回答，“人类因第三次冲击而屈服，基础设施的重建可能需要时间。动植物将一如既往，但如果莉利姆不重新夺回他们的位置，它们将开始主宰一切。”

"Can't you do anything about that?"  
"你就不能做点什么吗？"

"No, I can not. I don't have the power anymore. Though frankly, this is a good lesson for the Lilim."  
"不，我做不到。我已经没有那种力量了。不过坦白说，这对莉莉姆来说是个很好的教训。"

"I suppose," sighed Shinji. "But...I want to ask you something else...Asuka is-"  
"我想也是，""真嗣叹了口气。""但是...我想问你另一件事...明日香她-"

"LCL fluid along with everyone else," answered Lilith.  
"和 LCL 液体以及其他所有人一样，" 莉莉丝回答道。

"So then...is it not possible for me to find her?"  
"那么...我是否无法找到她？"

Lilith paused for a second before she said, "It is...possible, but unlikely. If your AT-field were able to find her, then the possibility exists. But I have to warn you Shinji."  
莉莉丝停顿了一下，然后说："有可能，但可能性不大。如果你的 AT 力场能够找到她，那么这种可能性是存在的。但我必须警告你，真嗣。"

"...What?" "...什么？"

"Asuka has likely regained her memories while floating in the LCL fluid, so if you meet her...I can't know what her reaction to seeing you would be."  
"明日香在 LCL 溶液中漂浮时很可能已经恢复了记忆，所以如果你遇到她...我无法预知她见到你会是什么反应。"

"How is that she would regain them?"  
"她怎么会恢复记忆呢？"

"Her memories of you were destroyed, but not lost. She remembered things, meaning that fragments remained. When everyone became LCL fluid, her memories likely reformed from the scattered pieces. It is possible even, that she has sectioned herself off from everyone else."  
"她关于你的记忆被摧毁了，但并未消失。她记得一些事情，意味着碎片仍然存在。当所有人都化为 LCL 液体时，她的记忆很可能从这些散落的片段中重新组合。甚至有可能，她已经将自己与其他人隔离开来。"

"Do you think I should find her."  
"你觉得我应该去找她吗？"

"I won't say anything," whispered Lilith. "Myself and Adam have already interfered enough in your life and the person you love. The damage that has been done may be...irrevocable."  
"我不会说什么，"莉莉丝低声说道，"我和亚当已经在你的生活和你所爱的人身上干预得够多了。造成的伤害可能是……无法挽回的。"

"What do you mean?" "你这是什么意思？"

"Asuka may hate you, because she will remember everything you did from the moment she lost her memories, and everything before she lost them. She will hate you for what you did to her."  
"明日香可能会恨你，因为她会记得失去记忆后你对她所做的一切，以及失忆前的一切。她会因为你对她所做的事而恨你。"

"What choice did I have then?"  
"那我还有什么选择呢？"

"It is in the past, so it no longer has any meaning. You can only look back and reflect on your mistakes. Maybe, with time, she will be able to forgive you."  
"那已是过去，不再具有任何意义。你只能回首反思自己的错误。或许，随着时间的流逝，她会原谅你。"

"What if she doesn't though?"  
"但如果她不原谅呢？"

"You will have to live with the knowledge of what you did," said Lilith mournfully.  
"你将不得不背负你所做之事的认知，"莉莉丝哀伤地说道。"

"...And there is nothing you could do?"  
"...你什么都做不了吗？"

Lilith was silent as she watched Shinji, but she eventually whispered, "There is something I can do, and I suppose you deserve it after everything I've put you through, but I can't do it without her consent as well."  
莉莉丝默默地看着真嗣，但最终低声说道：“我确实有办法，考虑到我让你经历的一切，你理应得到这个机会，但我不能在没有她同意的情况下这么做。”

"What is it?" “怎么了？”

"I won't say anything, not until you have found her. In the meantime though, I will halt Third Impact so that you have a chance to find her. But remember, it is extremely unlikely that you can find her."  
“我不会说任何话，直到你找到她。在此期间，我会阻止第三次冲击，让你有机会找到她。但记住，你找到她的可能性极其渺茫。”

"...I'm not worried about finding her, I'm worried about how she'll react after she sees me," mumbled Shinji.  
"...我并不担心找不到她，我担心的是她见到我之后的反应，" 真嗣喃喃自语道。

"Suit yourself," said Lilith. She watched as Shinji stood where he was and tried to search for his body high up within the earth atmosphere.  
"随你吧，" 莉莉丝说道。她看着真嗣站在原地，试图在高高的地球大气层中寻找自己的身体。

'You are a strange boy Shinji,' thought Lilith. 'I still can't understand you, even after watching you for several years, but I did get to see you grow unlike someone else, so I suppose it hasn't been all bad. But for what awaits you when you finally find the girl you love...I hope you are prepared.'  
'你真是个奇怪的男孩，真嗣，' 莉莉丝心想。'即使观察了你这么多年，我还是无法理解你，但我确实看到了你的成长，不像某些人，所以我想这也不全是坏事。但当你最终找到你爱的女孩时，等待你的会是什么呢...我希望你已经做好了准备。'

'He will be,' came a new voice from inside Lilith. 'I have faith that those two can become one again.'  
'他会回来的，'从莉莉丝内部传来一个新的声音，'我相信那两个人能够再次合二为一。'

'We'll see,' thought Lilith in reply to Rei's statement.  
'我们拭目以待，'莉莉丝在心中回应丽的话。

In front of her, Shinji's mind suddenly vanished, returning to its body high above in the atmosphere.  
在她面前，真嗣的意识突然消失，回到了高空中他的身体里。

---

Shinji opened his eyes in the entry plug of Unit 01 and looked down at the earth. True to her word, Lilith had halted Third Impact so that Shinji could find Asuka. Admittedly, he was finding it hard to believe half of what Lilith said, and he still loathed her for killing Asuka, but if she was truly remorseful about everything she had done, he could live with that.  
真嗣在初号机的插入栓内睁开眼睛，俯视着地球。正如她所承诺的，莉莉丝停止了第三次冲击，以便真嗣能找到明日香。不可否认，他很难相信莉莉丝说的一半内容，而且他仍然憎恨她杀死了明日香，但如果她真的对所做的一切感到悔恨，他可以接受这一点。

The black sphere in front of him...Asuka was somewhere within there, and he intended to find her.  
他面前的黑色球体……明日香就在那里面的某个地方，而他打算找到她。

Sending out his AT-field with his very self projected within it, he put all his thoughts into finding Asuka. He conjured up memories from times almost forgotten. Asuka cooking breakfast in the morning, eating lunch with her at school, there questionable date, every memory that he cherished of her, he thought as his mind plunged into the black sphere.  
他将自己的 AT 力场与自我意识一同投射出去，全心全意地寻找明日香。他唤起了几乎被遗忘的记忆。明日香早晨做早餐的样子，在学校与她共进午餐，那次问题重重的约会，每一个他珍视的关于她的记忆，他都一一回想，随着思绪深入黑色球体。

Darkness enveloped him almost instantly, but he felt the presence of people around him. Suddenly, the darkness lifted, and Shinji found himself floating in nothing but orange LCL fluid. Voices echoed all around him as he heard the people who had been turned in LCL fluid. Everybody's voice had blended into one however, so that it sounded like one coherent voice.  
黑暗几乎瞬间将他吞没，但他感觉到周围有人存在。突然间，黑暗消散，真嗣发现自己悬浮在一片橙色的 LCL 液体中。声音从四面八方传来，他听到了那些被转化为 LCL 液体的人们。然而，所有人的声音都融合在一起，听起来就像是一个连贯的声音。

'Asuka,' thought Shinji as he heard voices echoing all around him. He was saddened by the many people trapped within the sphere, but he couldn't do anything to help them right now.  
‘明日香，’真嗣听到周围回荡的声音时想道。他因被困在这个球体中的众多人而感到悲伤，但此刻他无能为力去帮助他们。

Shinji moved further within the sea of voices, continuing to search for Asuka, his thoughts constantly on her.  
真嗣继续在声音的海洋中深入，不断寻找着明日香，心中始终牵挂着她。

### Chapter 35: Finality
**Two years to the day I posted Spawn of Adam here on Fanfic. Its been an amazing run everybody, but here we go. This is the last chapter! Sorta. Epilogue after this but that doesn't count.** **Thank you to all the support I've received from everyone through these long two years. Its hard for me to believe that this is finally ending. This has been a huge part of my life over these past two years, and I'd like to thank everyone that has read this. Arigato Gozaimasu Minna-san!**  
两年前，我在 Fanfic 上发布了《亚当的后代》。大家的表现都很棒，但我们开始了。这是最后一章了！有点。在此之后有结语，但这不算数。感谢这漫长的两年里大家对我的支持。我很难相信这一切终于结束了。在过去的两年里，这是我生活中很重要的一部分，我要感谢所有读过这篇文章的人。 Arigato Gozaimasu Minna桑！

Lilith sat with her back against the Tree of Life, staring forward across the empty plane, her thoughts residing on Shinji and where his actions would take him. Whether she herself had orchestrated things so that it would reach this conclusion, she didn't know. She had affected both there lives to a certain extent, but ultimately, they had always seemed to have been drawn together ever since they had first met those many months ago. Even if Shinji wasn't an angel, that the Evangelions had never existed, that herself and Adam had never warred with each other, Lilith knew that Shinji and Asuka would still have connected as they did. She had to admit...she was jealous in a way; the two of them had something that she had never had. Well, that wasn't quite true she supposed...  
莉莉丝背靠着生命之树坐着，凝视着前方空荡荡的位面，她的思绪集中在真嗣身上，以及他的行动将带他走向何方。到底是不是她自己精心策划的，才会导致这样的结果，她不知道。她在一定程度上影响了两人的生活，但最终，自从几个月前第一次见面以来，他们似乎总是被吸引在一起。即使真嗣不是天使，即使新世纪福音战士从未存在过，即使她自己和亚当从未交战过，莉莉丝也知道真嗣和明日香仍然会像他们一样联系在一起。她不得不承认……她在某种程度上是嫉妒的；她嫉妒了。他们两个拥有了她从未拥有过的东西。嗯，她认为这并不完全正确……

Lilith titled her head upwards, looking at the dark sky devoid of any stars. She wondered how Shinji would fair inside the Black Egg. It was very easy to get lost within the sea of people, all of which were the same. But Shinji loved Asuka enough, and that alone would be enough to find her. After that though...  
莉莉丝抬起头，望着没有星星的漆黑天空。她想知道真嗣在黑蛋里会怎样。人海里很容易迷失方向，所有人都一样。但真嗣足够爱明日香，仅此一点就足以找到她。但在那之后...

"Hey...Rei?" mumbled Lilith as she continued looking upward.  
「喂……雷？」莉莉丝一边低声说道，一边继续向上看。

From within her, Rei replied.  
丽从内心深处回答道。

"Are you still having doubts about those two?"  
“你对那两个人还有疑问吗？”

"Even if Asuka does agree to returning, the damage has already been done, both inside and out. Even though I promised Shinji that I would help, the only thing I can help with is-"  
「即使明日香同意回来，内里外外的伤害都已经造成了。虽然我答应真嗣会帮忙，但我唯一能帮忙的就是——」

"They will be able to shoulder that hardship, even if it does torment them for years to come. I have faith in them. Shinji and Asuka are entwined together as you thought so much so that one can't live without the other."  
“他们将能够承受这种困难，即使这会在未来的岁月里折磨他们。我对他们有信心。真嗣和明日香是纠缠在一起的，因为你想得太多了，以至于一个人不能没有另一个人生活。”

"Do you have any idea why that is? You were able to observe them better than I was after all."  
“你知道这是为什么吗？你毕竟比我能更好地观察它们。”

"I can only say that they are connected in a way rarely seen by humans in this day and age. They are very much incomplete, but together, they are more whole. They make up for each others faults and problems, and are able to understand each other because they share similarities. Love doesn't describe there bond so much as the need to be close to each other. Even if they had just stayed friends, they would have still desired that warmth of being near."  
“我只能说，它们以当今时代人类很少见的方式联系在一起。它们非常不完整，但组合在一起，它们就更完整了。它们弥补了彼此的缺点和问题，并且能够彼此理解，因为他们有相似之处。爱并不更多地描述了彼此之间的联系，即使他们只是朋友，他们仍然渴望接近的温暖。”

"Was there ever a possibility of them breaking apart?"  
“他们有分手的可能吗？”

"Even now that possibility still exists, but Shinji should be able to negate that. His actions have driven them this far after all."  
「虽然现在这种可能性仍然存在，但真嗣应该能够否定这种可能性。毕竟是他的行为让他们走到了这一步。」

Lilith was silent now, as Rei finished speaking, but something still lingered on her mind.  
雷说完，莉莉丝沉默了，但她的脑海里仍然残留着一些东西。

"Rei, I consider you as much a part of my mind as I do myself...so what will happen to Shinji after him and Asuka return."  
“丽，我认为你就像我自己一样是我思想的一部分……那么他和明日香回来后真嗣会发生什么。”

"Meaning?" “意义？”

"After I...help them I mean..."  
“在我……帮助他们之后，我的意思是……”

Rei did not reply for a long while here, and seemed to be deep in thought over something which had troubled her for a long while. Eventually though, she voiced her thoughts on the matter.  
丽在这里良久没有回复，似乎正在思考一件困扰她许久的事情。但最终，她还是表达了自己对此事的看法。

"I understand what you are getting at, and that will not change, so the possibility would exist."  
“我明白你的意思，这一点不会改变，所以这种可能性是存在的。”

"I see," sighed Lilith glumly. If possible, she didn't want something like that to happen, as it could send everything into turmoil once again, but that wouldn't be her decision after all. That would be something Shinji and Asuka would have to deal with when the time came, if it ever did of course.  
“我明白了，”莉莉丝闷闷不乐地叹了口气。如果可以的话，她不希望这样的事情发生，因为这会让一切再次陷入混乱，但这毕竟不是她的决定。这将是真嗣和明日香到时候必须处理的事情，当然，如果确实如此的话。

Shinji had never given much thought as to how many people lived on the earth, but having several billions people talking to you all at once put it into perspective. It was like having a constant ache in your ear, unable to get ride of it. Everybody recognize Shinji for who he was, an entity that was unique for everyone else, somebody that could help him. Some even ridiculed him, yelling at him, screaming for him to help them. But Shinji couldn't do anything for them. Visions and such flashed by him, but everything was so blurred and meshed together that he couldn't tell any one person apart from anyone else.  
真嗣从来没有过多考虑过地球上有多少人，但有数十亿人同时与你交谈，你就可以正确地看待这个问题了。就好像你的耳朵经常疼痛，无法缓解。每个人都认识真嗣，他是一个对其他人而言独一无二的个体，一个可以帮助他的人。有些人甚至嘲笑他，对他大喊大叫，尖叫着要他帮助他们。但真嗣却无法为他们做任何事。幻象之类的东西在他眼前一闪而过，但一切都是那么模糊、交织在一起，让他分不清谁是谁。

He continued moving forward through the sea of LCL fluid, floating helplessly as he let it carry him forward. He kept thinking of Asuka, hoping that his thoughts would carry him to wherever she was, but he his mind kept on being assaulted by everyone else's thoughts. He saw mothers, fathers, children, grandfathers and grandmothers. He saw people of all kinds of nationalities, religions, and races. Personalities meshed together like a melting pot, making Shinji's head feeling like splitting. But he had to move forward, because Asuka was somewhere within here.  
他继续在拼箱液的海洋中前行，无助地漂浮着，让它带着他前进。他一直想着明日香，希望他的思绪能把他带到她所在的任何地方，但他的思绪不断受到其他人的思绪的攻击。他看到了母亲、父亲、孩子、祖父和祖母。他见过各种国籍、宗教和种族的人。不同的性格就像一个大熔炉一样交织在一起，让真嗣的头仿佛要裂开了。但他必须继续前进，因为明日香就在这里面的某个地方。

What would he say when he saw her? "I'm sorry for not telling you I loved you sooner? Sorry that I caused all this? Sorry that I caused all your pain and suffering?" That wouldn't cut it. Shinji wanted to say these things though, even if Asuka still hated him. He wanted to be truthful and heartfelt for once, instead of always running away from everything. He had been running away from everything all his life, never truly standing and facing it. But now, he just wanted to be with Asuka, even if she rejected him, even if she loathed him. He just wanted to say those three simple words to her.  
当他看到她时，他会说什么？ “对不起，我没有早点告诉你我爱你？对不起，我造成了这一切？对不起，我造成了你所有的痛苦和磨难？”那不会削减它。尽管明日香仍然讨厌他，但真嗣还是想说这些。他想要一次真诚和真心，而不是总是逃避一切。他一生都在逃避一切，从未真正站起来、面对它。但现在，他只想和明日香在一起，哪怕她拒绝他，哪怕她厌恶他。他只想对她说这简单的三个字。

This thought is what kept Shinji sane as he continued through the sea of LCL fluid.  
这个想法让真嗣在拼箱液体的海洋中继续前行时保持理智。

'Who am I?' '我是谁？'

'You are you and no one else.'  
“你就是你，没有别人。”

'What makes up the fact that I am me?'  
“什么构成了我就是我这个事实？”

'What do you mean?' '你是什么意思？'

'How do I know that I am me and not someone else?'  
“我怎么知道我就是我，而不是别人？”

'Why do you think you are someone else?'  
“你为什么认为你是别人？”

'I don't think that but...things don't feel right...'  
“我不这么认为，但是……事情感觉不太对劲……”

'What doesn't feel right?'  
“什么感觉不对劲？”

'I don't feel right.' “我感觉不对劲。”

'Does it hurt?' “痛吗？”

'It does...it hurts a lot. This pain...I-I've felt it before, and...I don't like it.'  
‘确实……很疼。这种疼痛……我、我以前感受过，而且……我不喜欢它。

'So you think something is...missing?'  
“那么你认为有什么东西……丢失了？”

'I do...but I don't know what...'  
“我愿意……但我不知道什么……”

'What exactly hurts?' “到底是什么痛？”

'...My heart...a constant pain in my heart, like a fist is clenching ahold of it.'  
“……我的心……我的心持续疼痛，就像一只拳头紧握着一样。”

'Maybe you lost something?'  
“也许你丢了什么东西？”

'I...lost something? But what?'  
‘我……丢了什么东西？但什么？

'That is for you to figure out, not me.'  
“这是你要弄清楚的，而不是我。”

Asuka opened her eyes into whiteness.  
明日香睁开眼睛，眼前一片惨白。

She was floating...no laying within a vast empty space of whiteness that seemed to stretch onward forever. She sat up, and looked around, searching for any distinguishing figure, but everything was still white.  
她漂浮着……不是躺在一片巨大的白色空间里，那片空间似乎永远向前延伸。她坐起身来，环顾四周，寻找任何明显的人影，但一切仍然是白色的。

"Where am I?" she wondered.  
“我在哪里？”她想知道。

Her voice, instead of echoing, seemed to be swallowed by the whiteness.  
她的声音不但没有回响，反而像是被白色吞噬了。

Standing up, she firstly noticed that she was naked, but this didn't seem to bother her for some reason. She ran her hands along her body, remembering the feel of it. Things were starting to come back to her. She placed a hand between her breasts, shuddering as she recalled the feel of the Lance of Longinus as it impaled her. She then ran her hand behind her head, running it through her hair. She also remembered the instantaneous death that had killed her. The pain, the horror, the feel of slipping away, and-  
站起来，她首先注意到自己赤身裸体，但不知为何，她似乎并没有对此感到困扰。她用手抚摸着自己的身体，回忆着那种感觉。她的心开始回过神来。她将一只手放在胸前，回想起朗基努斯之枪刺穿她的感觉，她不寒而栗。然后她把手放在脑后，梳理头发。她还记得杀死她的瞬间死亡。痛苦、恐惧、溜走的感觉，还有——

"Shinji," whispered Asuka.  
“真嗣，”明日香低声说道。

As she spoke his name, her heart seared with pain, bringing her to her knees. Her eyes opened wide as she remembered that last feel of his touch before she had been killed. The warmth that had passed between them, it felt so familiar.  
当她说出他的名字时，她的心一阵剧痛，让她跪倒在地。当她想起她被杀之前他最后一次触摸的感觉时，她睁大了眼睛。他们之间传递的温暖，感觉是那么熟悉。

Once again, Asuka's heart seared at this thought.  
想到这里，明日香的心再次变得灼热起来。

'What is wrong with me?' wondered Asuka.  
'我是怎么了？'明日香想知道。

Asuka stood up again, and started walking aimlessly in one direction, still looking for any noticeable landmark, but she seemed to be the only person within this space.  
明日香再次站起来，漫无目的地朝一个方向走去，仍在寻找任何明显的地标，但这个空间里似乎只有她一个人。

'Lonely again...huh?' thought Asuka sadly as she paused and looked around her. But hadn't that been how everything always was? She had never had friends in high school or college, and her father had always abused her. She had only ever had her Eva, but now that was even gone. And now with Shinji gone she was-  
“又孤独了……嗯？”明日香停下来环顾四周，悲伤地想。但一切不都是这样吗？她在高中或大学期间从未有过朋友，她的父亲总是虐待她。她曾经只有她的伊娃，但现在它甚至消失了。现在真嗣走了，她——

Asuka's heart ached with pain, but this time, her head felt like it had been cloven asunder as it brought her to the ground. She sank down, clutch both her hand and where her heart was. Everything about Shinji was-  
明日香的心一阵剧痛，但这一次，她的头就像被劈成两半一样，把她摔倒在地。她坐了下来，紧紧抓住自己的手和心脏所在的地方。关于真嗣的一切都是——

'If it hurts, then just don't think about it.'  
“如果很痛，那就别想了。”

'But I can't stop thinking about him,' replied Asuka as she felt pain hit her. 'After all, Shinji is someone that I-'  
“但我无法停止想他，”明日香回答道，她感到疼痛袭来。 “毕竟，真嗣是我——”

Asuka opened her eyes and looked around wildly. For a split second, she had thought she saw...no, she did see something. A bubble, completely round was floating effortlessly in the vast whiteness. Asuka stared at it for a long, while not believing what she was seeing. But as Asuka continued watching, several bubbles continued appearing, one right after the other in front of her until the entire place was filled with these strange bubbles.  
明日香睁开眼睛，疯狂地环顾四周。有那么一瞬间，她以为自己看到了……不，她确实看到了一些东西。一个浑圆的气泡，在浩瀚的白色之中，毫不费力地漂浮着。明日香盯着它看了很久，不敢相信自己所看到的。但随着明日香继续观察，几个气泡不断出现，一个接一个地出现在她的面前，直到整个地方都充满了这些奇怪的气泡。

Asuka stood up slowly, staring at the bubbles around her. As one neared her, she moved away from it, though as it passed her, she noticed something inside of it. Looking closer, she saw images flashing inside it.  
明日香缓缓站起身来，盯着周围的气泡。当其中一个靠近她时，她就远离它，但当它经过她时，她注意到里面有什么东西。仔细一看，她发现里面有影像在闪烁。

'Thats...me? And Misato? And...Shin...ji?"  
'这就是我？还有美里呢？还有……真……？”

Asuka gazed at the bubble, inside which showed herself, Misato, and Shinji, all gathered around the kitchen table of Misato apartment and eating breakfast. Both Shinji and Asuka were in there school uniforms, and Misato seemed to be about ready to leave for Nerv. Asuka watched as she yelled something at Shinji, who promptly stood up and grabbed something from the fridge. The her inside the bubble then said something else, making Shinji retort back as well. Very quickly, the two started arguing with each other across the kitchen table, while Misato seemed to be completely oblivious to this, making it apparent that it happened all to frequently.  
明日香凝视着气泡，里面出现了她自己、美里和真嗣，他们都围在美里公寓的厨房桌子旁吃着早餐。真嗣和明日香都穿着校服，美里似乎正准备出发去涅夫。明日香看着她对真嗣大喊大叫，真嗣立刻站起来，从冰箱里抓起一样东西。泡泡里的她又说了些什么，真嗣也反驳道。很快，两人就隔着餐桌争吵起来，而美里似乎完全没有注意到这一点，显然这一切都发生得很频繁。

"Is this...my memory?" mumbled Asuka as she reached towards the bubble. As her fingers touched it, it immediately popped, clear fluid like tear drops falling from it.  
“这……是我的记忆吗？”明日香一边向泡泡伸出手，一边咕哝道。当她的手指触碰到它的时候，它立刻爆开，透明的液体如泪珠般从里面流了下来。

Asuka felt something then, almost like a jolt of some sorts, like something had just struck her. A shiver ran down her back, and she had to wrap her arms around her body to prevent herself from shivering.  
明日香感觉到了什么，几乎像​​是某种震动，就像有什么东西刚刚击中了她。她的后背一阵颤抖，她不得不用双臂抱住自己的身体，才不至于发抖。

But she remembered now...that day. So Shinji had lived with her at Misato's apartment.  
但她现在想起来了……那天。所以真嗣和她一起住在美里的公寓里。

"Then all of these...all of these are my memories?"  
“那这一切……都是我的记忆？”

Asuka looked at all of them, and saw that all of them had one thing in common: they all had Shinji in them.  
明日香看着他们所有人，发现他们都有一个共同点：他们都有真嗣。

"These are...the memories I lost?"  
“这些就是……我失去的记忆？”

Asuka watched as her memories floated by her, each with Shinji in them. She saw her and Shinji at school, in the apartment, and even fighting angels.  
明日香看着她的记忆从她身边飘过，每一个记忆里都有真嗣。她在学校、在公寓、甚至在战斗天使中都看到了她和真嗣。

Asuka then noticed a particular memory, showing her and Shinji sitting side by side and listening to something that looked like a tape recorder. She reached her hands towards this one, and touched it briefly with her index finger. It immediately popped, and she was assaulted again by a strange jolt, but the memories that flowed from this were startling, and Asuka surprisingly found herself laughing.  
明日香随后注意到了一段特殊的记忆，显示她和真嗣并排坐着，听着类似录音机的东西。她把手伸向这个，用食指轻轻触碰了一下。它立即弹出，她再次受到一种奇怪的震动的袭击，但由此产生的记忆令人震惊，明日香惊讶地发现自己笑了。

She was remembering when her and Shinji had to be completely synchronized with each other to defeat the fifth angel. The torment of having to do everything together, that damn machine, the stupid clothes they had to wear for the entire thing...and of course, sleeping in the same room. But it made Asuka smile slightly, as she knew that things were much easier then than now.  
她记得她和真嗣必须完全同步才能击败第五天使。必须一起做所有事情的折磨，那台该死的机器，他们必须穿着愚蠢的衣服来完成整个事情……当然，还有睡在同一个房间。但这让明日香微微一笑，因为她知道那时候的事情比现在容易多了。

But-

"What is this?" mumbled Asuka in shock.  
“这是什么？”明日香震惊地嘟哝道。

She had just remembered when her father had come looking for her.  
她这才想起来，父亲来找她的时候。

This time, Asuka's heart hurt in a different way, bringing up memories she had long sealed within herself. She felt nauseous, sick with pain as she saw herself stand there in shock, saw as Shinji stood there defending her, pure hatred etched into his face. Another memory, another memory must have existed before this.  
这一次，明日香的心以不同的方式疼痛，唤起了她封印已久的记忆。当她看到自己震惊地站在那里，看到真嗣站在那里保护她时，她感到恶心，疼痛难忍，脸上刻满了纯粹的仇恨。另一种记忆，另一种记忆在此之前一定已经存在了。

Fighting off the sense of worry that plagued her now, Asuka searched for a memory which could tie the two together. She found one that caught her attention almost instantly. In the memory, she saw herself pressing her face against Shinji's shoulder, tears running down her face. Shinji had his hands wrapped around her waist as he comforted her. Whatever it was...Asuka was nervous about the memory, but her desire to know what happened won her over.  
明日香奋力摆脱现在困扰她的忧虑，寻找能够将两人联系在一起的记忆。她几乎立刻就发现了一个引起她注意的东西。记忆中，她看见自己把脸贴在真嗣的肩膀上，泪水顺着脸颊流下来。真嗣双手环住她的腰，安抚着她。不管是什么……明日香对这段记忆感到紧张，但她想知道发生了什么的渴望赢得了她的支持。

She touched it, and felt a fresh flood of memories hit her.  
她摸了摸它，感觉一股新鲜的记忆涌向她。

Herself and Shinji were talking about themselves openly, seemingly for the first time. Asuka told Shinji all about growing up with her father, and the torment that she had undergone until she left for college. Asuka felt the weakness hit her as she remembered how she had felt when she had broken down and cried into Shinji's shoulder. Her knees wobbled slightly, and she had to prevent herself from falling.  
她自己和真嗣似乎是第一次公开谈论自己。明日香向真嗣讲述了她和父亲一起长大的一切，以及她在上大学之前所经历的折磨。当明日香想起自己崩溃并靠在真嗣肩头哭泣时的感受时，她感到全身无力。她的膝盖微微颤抖，她必须防止自己跌倒。

"So...Shinji already knew about my father before they met," gasped Asuka as she pressed a hand against her chest.  
“所以……真嗣在他们见面之前就已经知道我父亲了，”明日香喘着气说道，她一只手按在胸前。

But what happened then? Asuka thought back to when her father had answered the door. She had been scared, because her father wanted to talk to her, but Shinji wasn't going to allow it. But then what? Everything else afterwards was one giant blank. And how was this possible? She didn't remember ever meeting her father, nor had Misato or anyone else even bothered to mention that he had showed up.  
但后来发生了什么？明日香回想起父亲开门的时候。她很害怕，因为她的父亲想和她说话，但真嗣不允许。但然后呢？之后的一切都是一片巨大的空白。这怎么可能呢？她不记得曾经见过她的父亲，美里或其他人甚至懒得提及他曾出现过。

Something must have happened...  
一定是发生了什么事情……

Asuka turned back to her memories, searching for something she didn't want to find, but she had to know. She had to know what had happened with her and Shinji.  
明日香回到记忆中，寻找着一些她不想找到，但又必须知道的东西。她必须知道她和真嗣之间发生了什么。

She looked around again, looking for anything that might speak to her. What would it be though? Asuka saw many memories, most seemingly just day to day things involving Shinji. Some intrigued her though, but it didn't seem to be one she was looking for, but she marked it all the same, wanting to come back to it later.  
她再次环顾四周，寻找任何可能对她说话的东西。那会是什么？明日香看到了很多记忆，大部分似乎只是与真嗣有关的日常事务。虽然有些东西引起了她的兴趣，但这似乎不是她要找的东西，但她还是做了标记，想稍后再回来看。

One jumped out at her though. She saw herself walking up the steps of Misato's apartment, rain lashing against her shoulders. She was wearing a sleeveless shirt with jeans cut off at the knees and a pair of sandals, something that suitable for the rain. Asuka watched as she walked to Misato's door and knocked on it. Several seconds later, the door was flung open, and Shinji stood there.  
不过，有一个人向她跳了过来。她看见自己走上美里公寓的台阶，雨水拍打着她的肩膀。她穿着一件无袖衬衫，搭配膝盖处剪裁的牛仔裤，脚上是一双适合下雨天穿的凉鞋。明日香看着她走到美里的门前，敲响了门。几秒后，门被推开，真嗣站在那里。

Asuka didn't have to look any further to know this was the memory she was looking for.  
明日香不用再看就知道这就是她要找的记忆。

She reached out with timid fingers, and touched it.  
她胆怯地伸出手指，触碰了它。

She was immediately hit by a sense of cold, as though she herself had just been splashed with ice cold water. The rest of the memory came to her. She remembered how Shinji had held her as she broke down completely, repeatedly saying his name more desperately than before. The next part made her blush a little though. She saw as Shinji fought her out of her soggy wet clothes, but let out a sigh as she remembered taking things into her own hands. If Shinji had continued, Asuka would have died of embarrassment.  
她顿时感觉浑身冰凉，就好像自己被泼了一盆冰水。剩下的记忆又浮现在她的脑海里。她记得当她彻底崩溃时，真嗣抱着她，比以前更加绝望地一遍又一遍地喊着他的名字。接下来的部分却让她脸红了一些。她看到真嗣把她从湿漉漉的衣服中挣脱出来，但当她想起自己把事情掌握在自己手中时，她叹了口气。如果真嗣继续下去的话，明日香就会羞愧而死。

Afterwards, the explanation came, which Asuka admittedly didn't care about. Everything was fitting together so perfectly, but it still felt like she was remembering it all from a third perspective. It was hard to believe that this all had transpired.  
随后有解释，明日香承认对此并不在意。一切都那么完美地结合在一起，但她仍然感觉这一切都是从第三个角度来回忆的。很难相信这一切都发生了。

But what happened next. 但接下来发生了什么。

Everything was a blur suddenly.  
一切突然变得模糊起来。

Asuka saw as her father returned with Misato in tow. How he had said he wanted to talk to her, how she had stood up for herself. And then-  
明日香看到父亲带着美里回来了。他如何说他想和她谈谈，她如何为自己辩护。进而-

Asuka heard those words that her father had spoken, and before anything else, she saw Shinji crashing his fist against her fathers jaw. Asuka remembered hearing the sound of the bone snapping, the impact as Shinji's fist collided against the side of her fathers temple. The bright red color as blood spewed forth from his mouth. Asuka felt herself almost unable to deal with it, but a part of her also remembered the feeling from that time.  
明日香听到了父亲所说的话，然后首先看到真嗣用拳头猛击父亲的下巴。明日香记得听到骨头折断的声音，以及真嗣的拳头撞击到她父亲太阳穴侧面时的冲击力。鲜红的血液，从他的口中喷涌而出。明日香觉得自己几乎无法应对，但她的一部分也想起了当时的感觉。

It was one of relief, and she hated herself for feeling that now. She knew everything that her father had done to her, but he was still her father.  
这是一种解脱，她恨自己现在有这种感觉。她知道父亲对她所做的一切，但他仍然是她的父亲。

'Is it right to feel like this?' she wondered as she saw Misato attempt to reprimand Shinji, only to have him brush it off.  
“这样的感觉对吗？”当她看到美里试图斥责真嗣时，她感到很奇怪，但他却置若罔闻。

Surely it was understandable? But she couldn't help wonder where her father was at that moment.  
这当然是可以理解的吗？但她不禁想知道父亲此时在哪里。

Afterwards, Asuka remembered herself going into Shinji's room to seek comfort, though it had been awkward, and she remembered not being able to say what was truly on her mind then. She was saddened by this, sad that so many opportunities had come, but she had let them slip through her grasp.  
之后，明日香记得自己走进真嗣的房间寻求安慰，尽管这很尴尬，而且她记得当时无法说出自己真正的想法。她为此感到悲伤，悲伤的是这么多的机会来了，但她却让它们从她的手中溜走了。

She now took a deep breath, and opened and closed her eyes. As much as her memories intrigued her, they took a lot out of her. Remembering what she felt at the time was particularly exhausting.  
她现在深吸了一口气，睁开又闭上眼睛。尽管她的记忆让她着迷，但它们却让她失去了很多。回想起当时的感受，她特别心累。

Looking at her memories though, she noticed the ones from earlier that she had marked. Flashes of her and Shinji doing things filled the memory, and Asuka walked over to it, staring at it. She watched as her and Shinji went to an italian restaurant, ate ice cream, and walked around an exhibit of pre-Second Impact oceanic animals.  
不过，翻看她的记忆，她注意到了之前她标记过的那些。记忆中充满了她和真嗣做事的画面，明日香走过去，盯着它看。她看着她和真嗣去了一家意大利餐厅，吃了冰淇淋，并在第二次撞击前的海洋动物展览中散步。

'Is this...a date?' wondered Asuka as she continued looking at the memory. She slowly stretched her hand out to it, and grasped it.  
“这是……约会吗？”明日香一边思考着，一边继续看着记忆。她缓缓伸出手，握住了它。

Her mind was instantly filled with memories from that day. She saw as her and Shinji walked around the ocean exhibit, albeit not talking to each other for a while, though after a time, they seemed to make up. Then they entered a gift shop, and Asuka seem to realize something then, seconds before it happened. She was waiting outside when Shinji came out, and Asuka watched as he gave her the dolphin earrings that she treasured. Asuka felt tears well up at the corner of her eyes as she felt herself overcome with happiness, remembering the feelings that coursed through her at that moment in time. She watched as her and Shinji embraced each other; watched as she pressed her face against his shirt, and Shinji buried his face in her fiery hair.  
她的脑海里顿时充满了那天的回忆。她看到她和真嗣绕着海洋展览走来走去，虽然有一段时间没有互相交谈，但过了一段时间，他们似乎又和好了。然后他们进入了一家礼品店，明日香似乎在事情发生前几秒钟意识到了什么。当真嗣出来时，她正在外面等着，明日香看着他把她珍藏的海豚耳环交给了她。明日香回忆起那一刻的感受，眼角涌出泪水，幸福感溢于言表。她看着自己和真嗣拥抱在一起。看着她把脸贴在他的衬衫上，真嗣把脸埋进她火热的头发里。

And then Misato, Ritsuko, and Kaji showed up. Even now, Asuka knew that she shouldn't have done that. She had been embarrassed when they had seen herself and Shinji, and had immediately turned defensive.  
然后美里、律子和梶就出现了。即使现在，明日香也知道自己不应该这么做。当他们看到自己和真嗣时，她感到很尴尬，并立即变得防御起来。

She watched as they slowly made there way towards the beach, and the eventual water fight that ensued between them. Asuka remembered as they lay beside each other, talking aimlessly about meeting each other. Feelings were shared during that moment, even if they weren't spoken aloud. Afterwards though, when Asuka remembered what she had done, she blushed crimson. She remembered the feel as her lips came into contact with Shinji's forehead, and even though it was intended to be friendly, something was concealed in it.  
她看着他们慢慢地走向海滩，最后他们之间发生了水战。明日香记得他们躺在一起，漫无目的地谈论着见面的事。在那一刻，即使没有大声说出，人们也表达了自己的感受。但事后，明日香想起自己的所作所为，不禁脸红了。她记得自己的嘴唇接触真嗣额头时的感觉，虽然是出于友好，但其中却隐藏着某种东西。

She stood there, surrounded by her memories and she thought about what she had seen and felt so far. What Shinji had said before...when she had been alive, about them being friends...they had certainly been more than just friends. They had loved each other, even if it had never been spoken, and even now, they seemed to still love each other. So then why had Shinji lied again even at the end of everything? Was he still trying to protect her, or was he just trying to protect himself?  
她站在那里，周围都是她的回忆，她回想着迄今为止所见所感。真嗣之前说过……当她还活着的时候，他们是朋友……他们肯定不仅仅是朋友。他们曾经彼此相爱，即使从未说过，即使是现在，他们似乎仍然相爱。那么为什么真嗣在一切结束后又再次撒谎呢？他到底是想保护她，还是只是想保护自己？

Asuka shook her head as she thought back to that day and everything that had transpired. Everything that had happened was a clear example of who they were to each other. Even after she lost her memories, and Shinji denied everything that had happened, they still loved each other. So wasn't that enough? Shouldn't they just accept it? If you love someone, shouldn't you just express that love to the person you feel for?  
明日香摇了摇头，回想起那天以及所发生的一切。所发生的一切都清楚地表明了他们对彼此的看法。即使在她失去记忆、真嗣否认所发生的一切之后，他们仍然彼此相爱。那么这还不够吗？难道他们不应该接受吗？如果你爱一个人，你不应该向你所爱的人表达你的爱吗？

But they were also both fifteen, and had never known love of any form, so it was all so confusing.  
但他们也都十五岁了，从来不知道任何形式的爱情，所以这一切都是那么令人困惑。

Asuka looked back at her memories, now looking for one in particular. She wanted to find the one that had ended everything, the last memory before she had lost them. If she could trust what Ritsuko had said before, it had been an angel that had destroyed her memories of Shinji. So if she found something that looked like that-  
明日香回顾自己的记忆，现在正在寻找一个特别的记忆。她想要找到那个结束一切的人，找到她失去一切之前的最后一段记忆。如果她能相信律子之前所说的话，那么摧毁她关于真嗣的记忆的就是天使。所以如果她发现了类似的东西——

'Maybe this is it,' thought Asuka as she turned towards her right and saw one memory in particular. It didn't show Shinji, only herself enclosed in a white area, similar to the one she was in. She had her hands covering her head and was screaming something.  
“也许就是这样，”明日香想道，她转向右侧，看到了一个特别的记忆。它没有显示真嗣，只有她自己被包围在一个白色区域中，类似于她所在的区域。她双手捂着头，正在尖叫着什么。

Asuka neared this one, and looked at it closer. This was likely it...but remembering something like this, was that necessarily the best thing to do? Asuka continued staring at it, trying to understand the words she was saying. Something like this maybe...  
明日香靠近这个，仔细观察。大概就是这样……但是记住这样的事情，就一定是最好的事情吗？明日香继续盯着它，试图理解她所说的话。类似这样的事情也许...

But she reached forward anyway, and touched it.  
但她还是向前伸出手，触摸了它。

Pain exploded inside of Asuka's head. She screamed out, remembering the feel as her mind was violated, everything laid forth for the angel to see. Everything that she had ever happened during her childhood, she remembered, many things that she had done with Shinji, she saw and felt. And then-  
明日香的脑袋里一阵剧痛。她尖叫起来，回想起她的心灵被侵犯的感觉，一切都摆在天使面前。童年时发生的一切，她都记得，她和真嗣一起做过的许多事情，她都亲眼所见，感受到。进而-

Asuka's eyes turned white as the pain became unbearable. She felt hands touch her, running all along her body, grasping her painfully. She bit down on her tongue, preventing herself from screaming out. She saw a face, a horrible face which made her cringe, made her lose herself completely.  
疼痛变得难以忍受，明日香的眼睛变成了白色。她感觉到有双手抚摸着她，沿着她的身体，痛苦地抓着她。她咬住舌头，不让自己尖叫出来。她看到了一张脸，一张可怕的脸，让她感到畏缩，让她完全失去了自我。

And then it stopped. 然后它就停了。

Asuka fell to the ground, her body covered in sweat as she shivered uncontrollably. Everything...she had relived everything in a seconds notice, even things she didn't fully understand. She felt strange, disgusted, weak, violated. Her head hurt, her body hurt, her heart heart. Things were foggy, her recovered memories of Shinji blurred around the edges.  
明日香倒在地上，浑身都是汗，无法控制地颤抖着。一切……她在一瞬间就重温了一切，甚至是她不完全理解的事情。她感到奇怪、厌恶、软弱、被侵犯。她的头很痛，她的身体很痛，她的心也很痛。事情变得扑朔迷离，她恢复的有关真嗣的记忆也变得模糊起来。

'No...I don't want this...this pain,' thought Asuka.  
“不……我不想这样……这种痛苦，”明日香想。

'This is the price that comes with remembering everything again. You remember the good, and the bad.'  
“这就是再次记住一切的代价。”你会记住好的和坏的。

'No...no...' wined Asuka.  
“不……不……”明日香喝道。

From in front of her, came a memory unlike the others, a memory with no images, only black. Asuka saw this memory, and immediately knew that this was a bad memory, something that she never wanted to see. She stood up slowly, bracing herself as she did so. No matter what, she didn't want to know what-  
从她的面前，传来了一段与其他人不同的记忆，一段没有图像，只有黑色的记忆。明日香看到这段记忆，立刻就知道这是一段不好的记忆，是她永远不想看到的。她慢慢地站了起来，同时也做好了准备。无论如何，她不想知道什么——

The memory suddenly surged forward, enclosing Asuka's entire body in darkness. She was immediately thrown back to that time, that point in when she had been at her weakness. She saw the face, felt the breath of him, the feel as he touched her body. She wanted to scream out for help, but nobody was nearby, nobody to help her. He hit her repeatedly, tore at her body, mocked her. She wasn't going to make it...he was getting closer. The pain hit her; her heart cried out for help, her mind was growing hazy.  
记忆猛然向前涌动，将明日香的全身笼罩在黑暗之中。她立刻就被抛回到了那个时候，那个她最软弱的时候。她看到了他的脸，感觉到了他的呼吸，感觉到了他触碰她身体的感觉。她想大声呼救，但附近没有人，也没有人帮助她。他不断地打她，撕扯她的身体，嘲笑她。她不会成功的……他越来越近了。疼痛向她袭来；她的心在呼喊救命，她的思绪越来越模糊。

Bright light suddenly broke through the darkness, and Asuka saw Shinji standing there, an odd glow seeming to radiate off of him. His eyes glowed bright red as he marched towards the rapist. It happened in an orange flash of light. The body was torn asunder. Bone was crushed, limbs were shredded, fluid sprayed across the ground, and the head was turned into a ground meat.  
明亮的光芒突然冲破了黑暗，明日香看到真嗣站在那里，身上似乎散发着奇怪的光芒。当他走向强奸犯时，他的眼睛发出鲜红的光芒。事情发生在一道橙色的闪光中。身体被撕裂了。骨头被压碎，四肢被撕碎，液体喷洒在地上，头颅也变成了肉末。

Asuka shivered uncontrollably, her mind still hazy. This was...this was...  
明日香无法控制地颤抖着，她的大脑仍然一片混沌。这是……这是……

Something which should have stayed buried.  
一些本应被埋葬的东西。

The attempted rape, Shinji's ascension, the two things wove a web within Asuka's mind, preventing her to think of anything else. She could remember the feel of the hands, smell the blood, hear the crushing of the skull.  
强奸未遂，真嗣的升天，这两件事在明日香的脑海中编织了一张网，让她无法思考其他事情。她记得手的感觉、血的味道、头骨破碎的声音。

She felt like puking. 她感觉想吐。

How could she have forgotten something like this? But it was best that she had forgotten it...and now that she had.  
她怎么会忘记这样的事情？但最好她已经忘记了……现在她已经忘记了。

The feel...the feel of helplessness...even now it still.  
那种感觉……那种无助的感觉……至今依然如此。

"Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she sat there, staring at the white ground.  
“真嗣，”明日香坐在那里，盯着白色的地面，咕哝道。

It was overpowering her, that feel. Unable to do anything, never able to do a thing. Her father, the angel, the rapist. It all felt too real. She didn't know how to-  
那种感觉压倒了她。什么都做不了，什么都做不了。她的父亲，天使，强奸犯。这一切都感觉太真实了。她不知道如何——

Asuka suddenly felt her eyes lose focus. No! Not now! If you pass out now-  
明日香突然感觉自己的目光失去了焦点。不！现在不要！如果你现在昏倒了-

Asuka forced herself to fight the pain. She could beat it, she had before.  
明日香强迫自己对抗疼痛。她可以战胜它，她以前就做到了。

But that was because Shinji was with her, and now without him-  
但那是因为真嗣和她在一起，而现在他不在了——

Asuka tilted to her right, and fell to the ground, tears streaming from her eyes. Even if she could remember Shinji, having him by her side wasn't the same. If only she could feel him, know that he was still somewhere out there. But she didn't even know where was.  
明日香向右倾斜，倒在地上，泪水从眼中流淌出来。即使她记得真嗣，有他在她身边也不一样。如果她能感觉到他，知道他还在外面的某个地方就好了。但她根本不知道这是哪里。

Everything was too overpowering. Her memories held cherished thoughts, but they also held bitter ones, sad ones, ones that were too painful to think about. She wanted everything to just slip away. If this was how things would be, then she would rather not have remembered any of this.  
一切都太过势不可挡。她的记忆里有珍贵的想法，但也有苦涩的、悲伤的、痛苦不堪的想法。她希望一切就这么溜走。如果事情真的是这样，那她宁愿不记得这一切。

'It hurts,' mumbled Asuka. 'It hurts a lot.'  
“很痛。”明日香咕哝道。 '非常疼。'

And without anybody there to comfort her, Asuka slowly started to slip away...  
没有人安慰她，明日香慢慢地开始溜走……

---

Shinji was starting to get desperate. He had no idea how long it had been since he had entered the black sphere, but he still hadn't managed to find Asuka. What was he doing wrong? Why wasn't he able to find her. Was it impossible as Lilith had hinted at? But he was trying with everything he had damn it! If he wasn't able to find Asuka...  
真嗣开始绝望了。他不知道自己进入黑色球体已经有多久了，但他仍然没有找到明日香。他做错了什么？为什么他找不到她。难道真像莉莉丝暗示的那样不可能吗？但他正在竭尽全力地尝试！如果他找不到明日香的话……

'No, don't think like that,' Shinji told himself. 'Everything will be fine!'  
“不，不要这样想，”真嗣告诉自己。 '一切都会好起来的！'

But there was a small voice in the back of his mind that asked, 'What if?'  
但他内心深处有一个小小的声音问：“如果呢？”

Shinji didn't want to answer what if.  
真嗣不想回答“如果”的话。

The LCL fluid still seemed to have a mind of its own, and just carried him wherever it pleased. Even though Shinji had his mind on Asuka, it still didn't seem to be enough.  
拼箱液体似乎仍然有自己的意志，可以带着他去任何它想去的地方。尽管真嗣把心思放在明日香身上，但似乎还不够。

So then what did he have to do?  
那么他必须做什么呢？

Shinji had managed to tune most of the voices out by then, so that wasn't the problem here. It was like the LCL fluid didn't want him to go to where Asuka was.  
那时真嗣已经成功地消除了大部分声音，所以这不是这里的问题。就好像拼箱液不想让他去明日香所在的地方一样。

'Fuck that,' thought Shinji bitterly as he paused in the midst of the LCL fluid. He looked all around him, looking for anything that might help him. Asuka was somewhere within here right now, and Shinji new that she needed him. Some of her memories were best left untouched if at all possible, if she did remember them...  
“操，”真嗣在拼箱液体中间停了下来，痛苦地想。他环顾四周，寻找任何对他有帮助的东西。明日香现在就在这儿的某个地方，真嗣得知她需要他。如果可能的话，她的一些记忆最好不要被触及，如果她确实记得的话……

'Damn it,' thought Shinji.  
“该死，”真嗣想。

Now stationary, Shinji put all his thoughts into Asuka, and projected his AT-field outward, searching for her. The AT-field was an embodiment of who he is as a person, and with his feelings of Asuka projected into it, he should hopefully be able to find her.  
真嗣一动不动，将全部心思集中在明日香身上，向外投射AT力场，寻找她。 AT场是他这个人的体现，加上他对明日香的感情投射到其中，他应该有希望能够找到她。

But after many times of searching, Shinji didn't seem to be able to find Asuka. It was almost like she wasn't even there.  
但经过多次寻找，真嗣似乎都没有找到明日香。就好像她根本不存在一样。

'Is that possible though?' wondered Shinji. 'Could she be somewhere else?'  
“那可能吗？”真嗣想知道。 “她会不会在别的地方？”

But if she wasn't here, then where would she be?  
但如果她不在这里，那么她会在哪里？

'No, she had to be here, Lilith was sure of that much. But the problem is where. She likely sectioned herself off from everyone else, because of her grasp on herself, so that would mean-'  
“不，她必须在这里，莉莉丝确信这一点。但问题是在哪里。她很可能因为对自己的掌控而将自己与其他人隔离开来，所以这意味着——”

"Is there another part of this place?" mumbled Shinji. He didn't really see how there could be, unless Asuka had somehow created it herself.  
“这个地方还有别的地方吗？”真嗣咕哝道。他真的不明白怎么会有这种东西，除非明日香自己创造了它。

Shinji looked around him, but only saw LCL fluid that went on forever. But even so, the voices had diminished so that he didn't hear them as clearly anymore. It was like he had reached a different part of the sphere almost.  
真嗣环顾四周，却只看到了一直持续不断的拼箱液体。但即便如此，声音还是变小了，他听得不太清楚了。就好像他几乎到达了球体的另一个部分。

'More than anything else, I want to find Asuka right. To find her...and tell her anything. If those feelings aren't strong enough...'  
“最重要的是，我想找到明日香的正确身份。找到她……并告诉她任何事情。如果这些感觉还不够强烈的话……”

Once again, Shinji projected his AT-field outward, this time in a different direction.  
真嗣再一次向外投射他的AT力场，这次是在不同的方向。

'Asuka...Asuka...where are you right now? Are you lonely? What are you doing right now? What are you thinking? I want to see you...'  
“明日香……明日香……你现在在哪里？你孤单吗？你现在在做什么？你在想什么？我要见你...'

Shinji felt something strike his heart then, heard something almost echo inside of him. What was it? Something that was conjured up, something from a long time ago. A memory? Yes, a memory! A certain feel? A certain warmth? Between two people? The feel of embracing, the feel of kissing, the feel of love?  
真嗣感到有什么东西击中了他的心，几乎听到了他内心深处的回声。它以前如何？一些被召唤出来的东西，一些很久以前的东西。记忆？是的，一段回忆！某种感觉？某种温暖？两个人之间？拥抱的感觉，亲吻的感觉，爱的感觉？

Shinji's eyes darted towards a certain spot within the LCL fluid. Maybe it was simply the angel half of him speaking up, or it was something more human reacting to it, but this spot felt...unnatural almost.  
真嗣的目光飞向拼箱液体中的某个地方。也许这只是他一半的天使在说话，或者是一些更人性的反应，但这个地方感觉……几乎不自然。

Shinji paused in front of it, and ran a hand over the air. Nothing happened, but Shinji felt as though his hand had passed through something. Moving forward, and walked through what could only be described as a curtain of water. LCL fluid filled this entire space also, but in the center of it, floating unsupportably was-  
真嗣在它面前停了下来，伸出一只手在空中抚摸。什么都没发生，但真嗣感觉自己的手好像穿过了什么东西。继续往前走，走过了只能用水幕来形容的地方。拼箱液体也充满了整个空间，但在它的中央，却难以支撑地漂浮着——

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

Shinji moved forward, guided by his thoughts until he reached Asuka. He stretched out his hand, and caressed her face gently. She was unusually cold.  
真嗣在思绪的引导下向前移动，直到到达明日香面前。他伸出手，轻轻抚上她的脸。她异常冷漠。

"...Asuka," repeated Shinji. It felt like an eternity since he had seen her. But something was wrong. Her eyes were closed, and she wasn't moving.  
“……明日香，”真嗣重复道。自从见到她以来，他感觉就像过了一个世纪。但出了点问题。她的眼睛紧闭着，一动不动。

Without a second thought, Shinji projected his AT-field over her, and immediately noticed a change within her. Some of her memories had returned, some of which he had wished hadn't. He winced horribly and felt a low throb in his heart as he remembered his anger and rage over a certain event.  
真嗣不假思索地将AT力场投射到她身上，并立即注意到她体内的变化。她的一些记忆已经恢复，其中一些他希望没有。当他想起自己对某件事的愤怒和愤怒时，他猛地皱起眉头，心里一阵低沉的抽动。

But if she had remembered memories like that...  
但如果她还记得那样的记忆的话……

'You may not like the outcome.'  
“你可能不喜欢这个结果。”

Lilith's words echoed inside his head.  
莉莉丝的话在他脑海中回响。

If he didn't like the outcome, then he would just change it. Wasn't that what he had been doing for the longest time now after all?  
如果他不喜欢这个结果，那么他就会改变它。这不正是他已经做了很长时间的事了吗？

Shinji closed his eyes, and blended his AT-field with Asuka's. If any two people had tried this, it likely would not have worked. But since these two individuals were able to understand and love each other, it was able to work.  
真嗣闭上眼睛，将自己的AT力场与明日香的融合起来。如果任何两个人尝试过这一点，很可能都不会成功。但由于这两个人能够相互理解和相爱，所以它能够发挥作用。

Shinji slowly felt his mind start to fade as he entered into Asuka's thoughts. He only hoped that this decision was the right one.  
当真嗣进入明日香的思绪时，他慢慢地感觉到自己的思绪开始模糊。他只希望这个决定是正确的。

---

Shinji opened his eyes, taking several seconds to adjust to the light; everything was a whiteness that went on forever. Shinji stood up and looked down at his body, noticing that he was naked, but not caring that much.  
真嗣睁开了眼睛，花了几秒钟才适应了光线。一切都是一片白色，永远持续下去。真嗣站起来，低头看着自己的身体，发现他赤身裸体，但并没有太在意。

As he looked around he didn't see any defining features. He didn't even see Asuka in this emptiness. But she had to be here somewhere.  
当他环顾四周时，他没有看到任何明显的特征。在这片空虚中，他甚至没有看到明日香。但她必须在这儿的某个地方。

Shinji started moving forward, turning every which way as he went, searching for some sign of Asuka. Once or twice, he tried sending out his AT-field, but he supposed that was impractical right now.  
真嗣开始向前走，边走边转，寻找明日香的踪迹。有一两次，他尝试发出他的 AT 场，但他认为现在这是不切实际的。

'Just how big is this place exactly?' wondered Shinji.  
“这个地方到底有多大？”真嗣想知道。

As Shinji thought this, he saw something which made him rub his eyes, thinking he was tired. A bubble was floating along in the air, a bubble which was flashes images of himself. Shinji stared at this for a long while, watching it as it passed him. Shinji then turned towards the direction of where it had came from, and saw many other bubbles like it.  
正当真嗣这么想的时候，他看到了一些东西，让他揉了揉眼睛，以为自己累了。空气中漂浮着一个气泡，一个气泡中闪烁着他自己的影像。真嗣盯着它看了很久，看着它从他身边经过。真嗣转头看向它来的方向，看到了许多类似的气泡。

'Are these Asuka's memories?' thought Shinji.  
“这些是明日香的记忆吗？”真嗣想。

As Shinji rushed in the direction the memories came from, he noticed all of them had something to do with him, ones that Asuka should certainly have forgotten, yet here they were. Some of them Shinji had even forgotten himself, so he was surprised to see them. He had forgotten how different things were before he had gotten his angel powers. If things could only have stayed the same...  
当真嗣冲向记忆来源的方向时，他发现所有这些记忆都与他有关，明日香当然应该忘记的，但它们却在这里。其中一些真嗣甚至忘记了自己，所以他看到他们感到很惊讶。他已经忘记了在获得天使力量之前事情有多么不同。如果事情能保持不变就好了……

Shinji finally reached where the memories had congregated, and ran towards them, careful to dodge them as he went, afraid of popping them. As he neared the center, he saw a shape on the floor, completely different than that of the memories. The fiery hair of Asuka stood out particularly bright in the expanse of whiteness.  
真嗣终于到达了记忆聚集的地方，向他们跑去，边走边小心地躲开它们，生怕撞到它们。当他接近中心的时候，他看到地板上有一个与记忆中完全不同的形状。明日香火红的头发在一片白色中显得格外耀眼。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Asuka gave no sign that she heard him, but her head did turn slightly to its left, looking towards him.  
明日香没有表现出听到他说话的迹象，但她的头确实稍微向左转，看向他。

Shinji threw himself to the ground beside her, grabbing her shoulders and pulling her towards himself, cradling her in his arms, giving no sign that he cared that she also was naked. Even now she was unusually cold. Her skin was pale white, and her lips had a light purple tinge to them. But it was her eyes that scared Shinji. They were hazy, as though not really seeing anything.  
真嗣倒在她身旁的地上，抓住她的肩膀，将她拉向自己，将她搂在怀里，丝毫没有表现出他在意她也赤身裸体。即使现在，她也异常冷漠。她的皮肤白皙，嘴唇带着浅紫色。但真正让真嗣害怕的是她的眼睛。他们目光朦胧，仿佛什么也没看见。

"Asuka...c'mon Asuka...wake up..."  
“明日香……来吧，明日香……醒醒……”

Shinji stared down at her face. Her eyes were fixated on him, but Shinji knew that she wasn't really seeing him.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸。她的眼睛盯着他，但真嗣知道她并不是真的在看他。

"C'mon...this is a joke...right? Asuka!"  
“得了吧……这是个玩笑……对吗？明日香！”

Shinji yelled her name again, pressing his body against hers, trying to convey the feeling of warmth. He buried his face in her hair, running his hand along her bare back, trying to bring her back.  
真嗣再次喊着她的名字，将自己的身体压在她的身上，试图传达温暖的感觉。他把脸埋进她的头发里，用手抚摸着她光秃秃的后背，试图把她拉回来。

"Something...anything...Asuka please." Shinji started crying, his tears falling upon her face.  
“有事……有事……明日香拜托了。”真嗣开始哭泣，泪水落在她的脸上。

He never even got to tell her-  
他甚至都没来得及告诉她——

...shin... ...胫...

Shinji opened his tear strained eyes and looked down at her  
真嗣睁开泪眼，低头看着她

...shin...ji... ……申……吉……

Asuka opened and closed her mouth, her voice barely more than a whisper.  
明日香张开嘴又闭上，她的声音几乎只是耳语。

"Asuka!" “飞鸟！”

"Shin...ji? “新……吉？

"Asuka are you-" “明日香你是——”

"Shinji...listen..." mumbled Asuka.  
“真嗣……听着……”明日香咕哝道。

"Asuka don't say anything else, I-"  
“明日香别再说什么了，我——”

"I remembered everything...everything painful, everything wonderful..."  
“我记得一切……一切痛苦的事情，一切美好的事情……”

Shinji was silent as he held her, looking down at her face. She was speaking in a very low voice, her eyes still clouded over.  
真嗣沉默地抱着她，低头看着她的脸。她说话的声音很低，眼神依然阴沉。

"And Shinji...there was a lot of pain involved, but I'm still glad that I chose to remember you..."  
“而真嗣……虽然经历了很多痛苦，但我仍然很高兴我选择记住你……”

"Asuka..." “明日香……”

Asuka smiled, and cupped Shinji's face with one of her hands. "Idiot...don't cry like that."  
明日香微笑着，用一只手捧起真嗣的脸。 “笨蛋……别哭了。”

"But...you..." started Shinji.  
“但是……你……”真嗣开口道。

But Asuka placed her index finger against his lips, silencing him.  
但明日香将食指放在他的嘴唇上，让他闭嘴。

"Don't say anything, because this is difficult for me," said Asuka with a low sigh. I've just remembered countless things, many of which I'd rather not remember. So don't say anything right now...I'm still not feeling very well...but having you here is..."  
“别说什么，因为这对我来说很难。”明日香低声叹了口气说道。我刚刚想起了无数的事情，其中​​很多我宁愿不记得。所以现在什么都别说……我还是感觉不太舒服……但是有你在这里是……”

Asuka turned her face, pressing it against Shinji's chest.  
明日香转过脸，将脸贴在真嗣的胸口上。

"...better," she mumbled quietly.  
“……好多了。”她低声咕哝道。

Shinji stared down at Asuka's face pressed against his chest. Her body was slightly warmer now, and her eyes seemed to be regaining their normal clear blue color.  
真嗣低头看着明日香贴在自己胸口的脸。她的身体现在稍微暖和了，她的眼睛似乎也恢复了正常的清澈蓝色。

"Hmmm...okay," said Shinji as he rested his chin upon her head.  
“嗯……好吧，”真嗣把下巴靠在她的头上说道。

They stayed like that for an unforetold amount of time, and Shinji had nodded off several times while watching Asuka. After a long while though, Shinji felt himself being roused awake by something soft. As he slowly opened his eyes, his vision was completely taken up by Asuka who was sitting in front of him and lightly tapping his cheek.  
他们就这样呆了很长一段时间，真嗣看着明日香，好几次打瞌睡。过了好一会儿，真嗣感觉自己被某种柔软的东西惊醒了。当他缓缓睁开眼睛时，他的视线完全被坐在他面前轻轻拍着他脸颊的明日香占据。

"Shinji? You awake?" “真嗣？你醒了？”

"...Yeah...sorry..." “……是啊……抱歉……”

"No...don't be. You came to get me. Any longer and I probably would have faded completely."  
“不……别这样。你是来抓我的。再拖下去我可能就彻底消失了。”

"What happened to you? What were you like that? I thought that you had-"  
“你怎么了？你当时是什么样子？我以为你——”

"I remembered...certain things. They affected me heavily, probably always will. I almost shut myself out, simply because it was easier to do that have to remember the pain. Without you there Shinji, I wasn't able to continue. Any later and I would have-"  
“我记得……某些事情。它们对我影响很大，可能永远都会。我几乎把自己拒之门外，只是因为记住痛苦更容易做到。没有你在，真嗣，我无法继续下去再晚一点，我就会——”

"Don't say that, I don't want to think about that," said Shinji as he shook his head.  
“别这么说，我不想考虑这个。”真嗣摇摇头说道。

"Thank you," said Asuka wearily.  
“谢谢你。”明日香疲倦地说。

"Are you okay?" asked Shinji.  
“你还好吗？”真嗣问道。

"Yes..and no," said Asuka. "Everything hurts, but I am at the same time happy that I could see you, which makes me have to ask, where are we exactly?"  
“是的……也不是，”明日香说。 “一切都很痛苦，但我同时很高兴能见到你，这让我不得不问，我们到底在哪里？”

"In the Black Egg of Lilith I suppose," said Shinji.  
“我想是在莉莉丝的黑蛋里。”真嗣说道。

"So then, this is Third Impact? Are we in the middle of Instrumentality?"  
“那么，这是第三次冲击吗？我们正处于工具性之中吗？”

"We were, but I talked to Lilith, and we reached an understanding. Its really thanks to Lilith and Rei that I was able to find you."  
“是的，但是我和莉莉丝谈过，我们达成了谅解。真的多亏了莉莉丝和丽，我才能够找到你们。”

Asuka was silent however, her face expressionless.  
然而明日香却沉默不语，面无表情。

"Are you angry at her, for killing you?" asked Shinji eventually.  
“你因为她杀了你而生她的气吗？”真嗣最终问道。

"I am, but I can still feel the pain of dying..."  
“是啊，但我还是能感受到死亡的痛苦……”

"Don't worry, it will pass," Shinji assured her.  
“别担心，一切都会过去的。”真嗣向她保证。

"...I...hope so," sighed Asuka.  
“……我……希望如此，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji looked down at her face, surprised at how worn it seemed. Even though Asuka was only fifteen, she seemed to have aged exponentially during her time in here.  
真嗣低头看着她的脸，惊讶地发现她的脸是如此憔悴。尽管明日香只有十五岁，但在这里的这段时间里，她似乎苍老了很多。

"How are you feeling?" Shinji asked her.  
“你感觉怎么样？”真嗣问她。

"Better I suppose, though still very tired. My mind is a whirl of things, and I'm having trouble keeping track of the different memories. Its like, a different me existed in the memories from before; I'm having trouble coming to terms with that. And yourself also...you were also very different."  
“我想好多了，虽然还是很累。我的脑子里乱七八糟，我很难记住不同的记忆。就像，记忆中存在着一个与以前不同的我；我很难恢复过来。”就这一点而言，你自己也很不同。”

"I know..." mumbled Shinji.  
“我知道……”真嗣咕哝道。

"Why did you do it Shinji? Why didn't you just tell me flat out that we had loved each other? Even at the end, you still lied to me about us, saying that we were only friends."  
“你为什么要这么做，真嗣？你为什么不直接告诉我我们彼此相爱？甚至到了最后，你仍然对我们撒谎，说我们只是朋友。”

Shinji had hoped that she wouldn't bring this up, but he didn't have any way of evading the question.  
真嗣本来希望她不要提起这件事，但他却没有办法回避这个问题。

"I told you before about my visions and how I was able to see possibilities of the future involved with the people around me. You were always at the forefront of my mind, and I tried denying that by rejecting what I felt. I sealed off my own emotions after you lost your memories, but that didn't work of course. I still remembered things, even if they were very vague. I knew what had happened once, and knew that it could happen again. I couldn't let anything happen to you however, and promised myself that I would do everything in my power to prevent you from entering an Evangelion again. But you proved too stubborn, and surprised me again and again."  
“我之前告诉过你我的愿景，以及我如何能够看到与周围的人有关的未来的可能性。你总是在我的脑海中，我试图通过拒绝我的感受来否认这一点。我封锁了你失去记忆后我自己的情绪，但这当然不起作用，即使它们非常模糊，我知道曾经发生过什么，并且知道它可能会再次发生。不管你发生什么事情，我都向自己保证，我会尽一切努力阻止你再次进入新世纪福音战士，但事实证明你太固执了，一次又一次让我感到惊讶。”

Asuka stared back at him, her face mere inches away from his. Looking down at his chest, she rest her head against it and spoke softly.  
明日香回望着他，她的脸距离他的脸只有几英寸。低头看着他的胸口，她把头靠在他的胸口上，轻声说道。

"The feeling had always been there as you said, but it always hurt...just seeing you hurt sometimes. And those earrings...that day confuses me, but I still understand what had happened, and yet, everything was snatched away afterwards."  
“就像你说的，这种感觉一直都在，但总是很痛……只是有时看到你受伤。还有那些耳环……那天让我很困惑，但我仍然明白发生了什么，然而，一切都被夺走了。”然后。”

"It was," Shinji nodded. “是的。”真嗣点点头。

Asuka was silent now, her face still pressed against Shinji's chest, not carrying that hers and his bodies were so entwined with each other.  
明日香现在沉默了，她的脸仍然贴在真嗣的胸口上，没有意识到她和他的身体如此纠缠在一起。

"What...will we do now?" asked Asuka.  
“我们……现在做什么？”明日香问道。

"Lilith promised me something," said Shinji after a few seconds. "I don't know what it is, but if it can get rid of your pain..."  
“莉莉丝答应了我一件事。”几秒钟后真嗣说道。 “我不知道那是什么，但如果它能解除你的痛苦的话……”

"That would be nice," sighed Asuka.  
“那就太好了，”明日香叹息道。

Shinji smiled slightly, and wrapped his arms around her back, running his hands along it, pausing at the groves and tracing a line. Asuka shivered slightly at his touch, but let him continue on as he pleased. She didn't care that they were both naked right now, she only cared about this feeling that was running through her right now. But she was afraid that if Shinji let go, the pain of her memories would overtake her again.  
真嗣微微一笑，用双臂搂住她的背，用手抚过她的背，在树林处停下来，画出一条线。明日香在他的触碰下微微颤抖，但还是让他继续说下去。她不在乎他们现在都赤身裸体，她只在乎此刻流淌在她身上的这种感觉。但她害怕，如果真嗣放手，记忆中的痛苦会再次降临到她身上。

"Hey Shinji..." “喂，慎二……”

"Hmmm?" “嗯？”

"Do you still love me?"  
“你还爱我吗？”

Her question caught him off guard, and he paused with the stroking of her back. Did he still love Asuka? He always told himself that he did, but sometimes he didn't rightfully understand what love was, or if this was how it was supposed to feel.  
她的问题让他措手不及，他停了下来，抚摸着她的背。他还爱明日香吗？他总是告诉自己他做到了，但有时他并没有正确理解爱是什么，或者这是否应该是这样的感觉。

"I do," said Shinji slowly. "Though I don't understand it myself..."  
“我愿意。”真嗣缓缓说道。 “虽然我自己也不太明白……”

Asuka looked up at Shinji, a frown on her face.  
明日香抬头看着真嗣，脸上皱起了眉头。

"Do you really have to understand it?" wondered Asuka.  
“你真的必须明白吗？”明日香想知道。

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Letting out a low sigh, Asuka's breath tickled Shinji's chest, making him squirm. Asuka smiled slightly at this and said, "Love isn't something easily understood in the first place, something which I've realized recently. But if being around somebody makes you happy, shouldn't that be enough?"  
明日香低低地叹了口气，呼吸喷在真嗣的胸口，让他浑身蠕动。明日香闻言微微一笑，说道：“爱情本来就不是一件容易理解的事情，我最近才意识到这一点。但如果有人在身边能让你快乐，那不就足够了吗？”

Shinji looked at Asuka's face, feelings and emotions running through him which he had forgotten. Asuka was...had always been, somebody important to him, somebody that could never be replaced. If this was love...then-  
真嗣看着明日香的脸，他已经忘记了他的感受和情绪。明日香是……一直都是，一个对他来说很重要的人，一个永远无法取代的人。如果这就是爱……那么——

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka's back, and pulled her towards him, resting his forehead against hers as he did so. Asuka smiled slightly as she closed her eyes, enjoying the feel of closeness that radiated from herself and Shinji.  
真嗣用双臂搂住明日香的背，将她拉向自己，同时将额头抵在她的额头上。明日香微微一笑，闭上眼睛，享受着自己和真嗣散发出的亲密感。

"Hey Shinji...would it be selfish of me to do something?" asked Asuka quietly.  
“嘿，真嗣……我这样做会不会很自私？”明日香轻声问道。

Shinji opened his eyes and looked at her. Her eyes were open as well as she stared back at him; they were incredibly clear.  
真嗣睁开眼睛，看着她。她的眼睛睁着，也盯着他。他们非常清楚。

Shinji shook his head softly.  
慎二轻轻摇了摇头。

"Okay," mumbled Asuka as she leaned into him, pressing her breasts against his chest as she kissed him. Though momentarily caught off guard, Shinji let his own emotions take hold, and kissed Asuka back, projecting his love of her through the kiss.  
“好吧，”明日香低声说道，她靠向他，将乳房贴在他的胸前，亲吻他。尽管一时措手不及，真嗣还是控制住了自己的情绪，回吻了明日香，通过这个吻表达了他对她的爱。

They broke apart shortly, and stared back at each other. It had been painful, but they had been able to overcome that pain.  
很快他们就分开了，互相对视着。这很痛苦，但他们能够克服这种痛苦。

"Hey Shinji," mumbled Asuka as she cupped his face in her hands.  
“嘿真嗣，”明日香用手捧着他的脸，咕哝道。

"Yeah..." nodded Shinji. “嗯……”慎二点头。

Asuka leaned forward, and kissed him again, her lips overlapping with his, her warmth meshing with his. Shinji placed his arms behind her bare back, running his hands along it. Asuka shivered at his touch again, but continued kissing him. She wanted this, even if they forgot it. She wanted to feel Shinji like this at least once. The future was uncertain, so she wanted to enjoy this moment without worry about what was to come.  
明日香倾身向前，再次吻了他，她的嘴唇与他的嘴唇重叠，她的温暖与他的交融。真嗣将双臂放在她赤裸的背后，抚摸着她的背。明日香因他的触碰再次颤抖，但仍继续亲吻他。她想要这个，即使他们忘记了。她想至少有一次真嗣这样的感觉。未来是不确定的，所以她想享受这一刻，而不用担心即将发生的事情。

Asuka broke the kiss off first, and looked away from Shinji. Her cheeks were slightly pink, but looking out of the corner of her eye, she saw that Shinji's as well were pink. She chuckled a little at that.  
明日香率先结束了这个吻，并把目光从真嗣身上移开。她的脸颊微微泛着粉红色，但她用眼角的余光看到真嗣的脸颊也是粉红色的。说到这里她轻笑了一声。

'We are only fifteen years old after all,' thought Asuka. Hopefully though, there would be many more moments like this to come.  
“我们毕竟才十五岁，”明日香想。但希望以后还会有更多这样的时刻。

"...Asuka...uhh..." stuttered Shinji  
“……明日香……呃……”真嗣结结巴巴地说

"Hmmm?" asked Asuka with a raised eyebrow, regaining some of her flare.  
“嗯？”明日香扬起眉毛问道，她的怒火又恢复了一些。

"Sorry...just surprised is all."  
“抱歉……只是惊讶而已。”

"I told you it was selfish," said Asuka as she stood up and threw her arms above her head, stretching her body. Now that they weren't so close, Shinji wasn't able to look at her. Partly because Asuka was still naked, but partly because he was still embarrassed over what had happened.  
“我告诉过你这是自私的，”明日香站起来，将双臂举过头顶，伸展身体。现在距离不再那么近，真嗣无法看她。部分是因为明日香仍然赤身裸体，但部分是因为他仍然对所发生的事情感到尴尬。

"Is this still inside the Black Egg though?" asked Asuka as she looked around.  
“这还在黑蛋里面吗？”明日香环顾四周问道。

"Yes...but this is inside your mind," said Shinji as she sat up, his eyes still looking at the ground.  
“是的……但这是在你的脑海里，”真嗣坐起身说道，他的眼睛仍然看着地面。

"How are you here exactly then?"  
“那你怎么在这里？”

"AT-field," said Shinji simply.  
“AT-field，”真嗣简单地说。

"Then how exactly are we supposed to get out?"  
“那我们到底该怎么出去呢？”

"That would be your doing I'm guessing," said Shinji.  
“我猜那是你干的，”真嗣说。

Asuka looked over at him, and frowned, annoyed that he wasn't looking at her. All right, yes this was highly embarrassing, and yes they were both naked, but hadn't they both basically said they still loved each other?  
明日香看着他，皱起眉头，因为他没有看她而生气。好吧，是的，这非常尴尬，是的，他们都赤身裸体，但他们不是基本上都说他们仍然爱着对方吗？

"Well...I'll try," said Asuka.  
“嗯……我会尽力的，”明日香说道。

Asuka closed her eyes then and searched for her body within the sea of LCL fluid. It was difficult at first, but Asuka knowing who she was, found her body relatively quickly. That and the fact it was sectioned off from everybody else.  
明日香闭上眼睛，在拼箱液的海洋中寻找着自己的身体。一开始很难，但明日香知道她是谁，很快就找到了她的身体。事实是它与其他人隔离开来。

"Did you find it?" asked Shinji. He felt the plane they were in suddenly lose some of its foundation.  
“你找到了吗？”真嗣问道。他感觉他们所在的位面突然失去了一些根基。

"Yeah, I did," said Asuka as she walked over to him and held a hand out. Shinji wordlessly took it, still trying not to look directly at her.  
“是的，我做到了，”明日香走到他身边并伸出一只手说道。真嗣一言不发地接过它，仍然试图不直视她。

"See above then," said Asuka with a small smile.  
“那就看上面吧。”明日香微笑着说道。

"Yeah..." mumbled Shinji.  
“是啊……”真嗣咕哝道。

The white walls around them shattered, and darkness engulfed the two of them. At first, Shinji was surprised by this, but saw Asuka unaffected by it, and assumed everything was okay.  
周围的白色墙壁破碎，黑暗吞没了两人。起初，真嗣对此感到惊讶，但看到明日香没有受到影响，并认为一切都很好。

Shinji opened his eyes within the sea of orange LCL fluid and looked quickly down at the girl next to him. After several seconds, Asuka opened her eyes slowly, blinking as she looked up at Shinji.  
真嗣在橙色的拼箱液体海洋中睁开了眼睛，迅速低头看着身旁的女孩。几秒钟后，明日香缓缓睁开眼睛，眨着眼睛抬头看着真嗣。

"Is this it?" asked Asuka as she sat up.  
“是这个吗？”明日香坐起来问道。

"It is..." said Shinji. “这是……”真嗣说道。

"I'm starting to wish I stayed in there."  
“我开始希望我能呆在那里。”

Shinji didn't appreciate the joke. Asuka however looked down at her body, and quickly covered it; she was still naked. Darting her gaze towards Shinji, she looked at him annoyingly, since he still had clothes on.  
真嗣不喜欢这个玩笑。明日香却低头看了看自己的身体，赶紧捂住了自己的身体。她仍然赤身裸体。她的目光投向真嗣，恼怒地看着他，因为他还穿着衣服。

"How come I'm naked and you're not?"  
“为什么我是裸体的，而你却不是？”

"Probably because I came from the outside," said Shinji. "And you seemed fine before."  
“可能是因为我是从外面来的吧。”真嗣说道。 “而且你之前看起来还不错。”

'Because you were naked also,' thought Asuka wordlessly.  
“因为你也赤身裸体。”明日香无言地想。

"Well...whatever. Lets get out of there. I want to see Lilith-"  
“好吧……无论如何。我们离开那里吧。我想见莉莉丝——”

Pain hit Asuka's heart as her memories caught up with her. Flashes of everything seared her mind so that she was forced to clutch her head in agony.  
当她的记忆追上她时，明日香的心感到疼痛。眼前的一切一幕幕闪过，让她的心灼痛不已，她不得不痛苦地抱住头。

"Asuka!" shouted Shinji. “飞鸟！”真嗣喊道。

Rushing to her side, he gripped her shoulders and held her against his chest. She was shaking uncontrollably.  
他冲到她身边，抓住她的肩膀，将她按在自己的胸前。她无法控制地颤抖着。

"Shinji...it hurts," Asuka groaned as tears started leaking from her eyes.  
“真嗣……好痛。”明日香呻吟着，泪水从她的眼中流淌出来。

'Damn it,' thought Shinji. Asuka's mind still wasn't able to cope with the new memories. Everything contradicted everything else so that she didn't know what was right anymore. And the rape...Shinji knew this is what tormented Asuka the most. Having to remember the feeling of it must have been too terrible.  
“该死，”真嗣想。明日香的大脑仍然无法应对新的记忆。一切都互相矛盾，让她不知道什么才是正确的。还有强奸……真嗣知道这才是最让明日香痛苦的事情。必须记住那种感觉一定太可怕了。

'But Lilith should be able to help,' Shinji told himself.  
“但是莉莉丝应该能够帮忙，”真嗣告诉自己。

"C'mon on Asuka. I'll guide you out."  
“来吧明日香。我带你出去。”

Asuka sniffed slightly and pressed her head against Shinji's chest, uncaring now that she was naked.  
明日香轻轻吸了吸鼻子，把头靠在真嗣的胸口上，毫不在意她赤身裸体。

Shinji continued moving forward through the stream of LCL fluid, carrying Asuka in his arms as he went, holding onto her dearly. Asuka was silent, but she was still shaking in Shinji's arms. Shinji didn't know what he was supposed to say to her, or how to even comfort her right now. He could try to alter her memories with his AT-field he supposed, but nothing good would likely come of that.  
真嗣继续在拼箱液流中前进，边走边抱着明日香，紧紧地抱住她。明日香沉默了，但她在真嗣的怀里仍然颤抖着。真嗣现在不知道自己该对她说什么，甚至不知道该如何安慰她。他认为他可以尝试用他的 AT 场改变她的记忆，但这样做不太可能有什么好处。

No, it was only Lilith that he could rely on right now.  
不，现在他能依靠的只有莉莉丝。

---

After what felt like hours, Shinji finally broke free of the Black Egg. The last stretch had surprised him however, as nobody tried to impede them. He suspected that Lilith might have had something to do with this.  
过了好几个小时，真嗣终于挣脱了黑蛋。然而最后一段让他感到惊讶，因为没有人试图阻止他们。他怀疑这件事可能与莉莉丝有关。

His body was of course still resting inside Unit 01, providing the equation to Third Impact, so this was where he was transported to after he broke free of the Egg. He felt his mind slowly float down into his body, but only one thing was missing.  
当然，他的身体仍在01号单元内，为第三次冲击提供了方程式，所以这就是他挣脱蛋后被传送到的地方。他感觉自己的神识慢慢飘落到体内，却唯独少了一样东西。

"Asuka?" asked Shinji. “明日香？”真嗣问道。

She had returned there with him. But he had been sure that she had been with him when he-  
她和他一起回到了那里。但他确信她一直在他身边，当他——

"I have her here with me Shinji," came Lilith's voice from around him.  
“我让她和我在一起，真嗣，”莉莉丝的声音从他身边传来。

"Lilith, if you do anything to harm Asuka, I swear."  
“莉莉丝，如果你做了任何伤害明日香的事，我发誓。”

"Relax, I wont harm her in any way. I just want to talk with you for now, about what happens now. I've put her mind at rest momentarily so she doesn't have to deal with the pain however."  
“放心，我不会以任何方式伤害她。我现在只想和你谈谈，谈谈现在发生的事情。我已经让她暂时安息了，这样她就不用承受痛苦了。”

"Fine, I'm coming over," said Shinji.  
“好吧，我这就过去。”真嗣说道。

Leaving his mind, he traveled to the Garden of Eden, and felt his feet slam down on the white soil there. He was standing in front of the Tree of Life. He stared at it for several seconds, looking at its withered state before he turned towards the two people beside it. Asuka was laying on the ground, breathing deeply as she rested. Shinji almost wished that things could stay like that forever, that Asuka wouldn't have to feel anymore pain. But such a thing was impossible.  
他抛开思绪，来到了伊甸园，感觉自己的脚踩在了那里的白色泥土上。他站在生命之树前。他盯着它看了几秒，看着它枯萎的样子，这才转向旁边的两人。明日香躺在地上，深呼吸着休息。真嗣几乎希望事情能永远这样下去，明日香再也不用感到痛苦了。但这样的事是不可能的。

Turning towards the person beside her, he looked at Lilith for a few seconds. She was looking down at Asuka with a curious expression on her face, something which reminded Shinji of Rei momentarily.  
他转头看向身边的人，看了莉莉丝几秒。她低头看着明日香，脸上带着好奇的表情，这让真嗣瞬间想起了丽。

"You found her," said Lilith simply.  
“你找到了她，”莉莉丝简单地说。

"There was never a moment when I didn't think I would," said Shinji.  
“我从来没有想过我会这么做，”真嗣说。

Lilith turned towards him and said, "But you were also a bit late. She remember things that her already weakened mind was not able to take, and without you there, she faded away. Though she is sleeping peacefully now, if she were to wake up, that pain would still be there."  
莉莉丝转头看向他，道：“不过你也来晚了一些，她已经记不清了，她本就虚弱的心智无法承受，没有你在，她就渐渐消失了。虽然她现在睡得很安稳，但如果她醒醒吧，疼痛依然存在。”

"But you said there was something you could do."  
“但你说过你可以做点什么。”

"I did, but I must first ask you Shinji about the circumstances of which you will be thrown in. I told you already that the world will be as it is for several years until the planet starts to regrow. If humans leave things untouched for a time, it will speed up the process. Not every human will return of course, some desiring the false reality, and they can become enamored in it for all I care. That is there decision. But humans will return nonetheless."  
“是的，但我必须先问你，真嗣，你将被扔进什么样的环境。我已经告诉过你，世界将在数年之内保持原样，直到地球开始重新生长。如果人类不去碰触一切，当然，并不是每个人都会回归，有些人渴望虚假的现实，他们可能会迷恋它，但这就是我所关心的决定，但人类仍然会回归。”

"As for you and Asuka...it seems impossible to separate you. Whether you have your memories in tact or not, you two still sot each other out. I don't believe it is a thing that can be prevented, but I can alleviate your pain to some degree, as I am partially to blame because of that pain."  
“至于你和明日香……似乎不可能分开。无论你们的记忆是否完整，你们两个人还是在互相较量。我不认为这是可以阻止的事情，但我可以在某种程度上减轻你的痛苦，因为我对这种痛苦负有部分责任。”

"Shinji, as you know, Adam created the bodies of you humans, and I created your AT-field, everything that incorporates a person. There personality, thoughts, and memories, they all make up who a person is. The angels each had a power, and Adam and myself being the forerunners had powers of creation. I created things more abstract, while Adam created things more physical. The AT-fields are an example of this. They are impossible to see or feel by normal humans, but they exist nonetheless."  
“真嗣，如你所知，亚当创造了你们人类的身体，而我创造了你们的 AT 场，以及包含一个人的一切。有个性、思想和记忆，它们都构成了一个人。每个天使都有亚当和我自己是先驱者，我创造了更抽象的事物，而亚当创造了更物理的事物，AT 场就是一个例子，它们是普通人无法看到或感觉到的。尽管如此，它们仍然存在。”

"Shinji...though you and Asuka love each other, you both unknowingly hurt each other and were hurt by the things around you, and this is no more apparent then with what Asuka is dealing with right now. If she had never met you, would she ever have experience those things? The same for you; if you had never met Asuka, would you ever have discovered your angel powers and the fact that you are Adam's son? All these things hurt you however, even if they are the truth, for the truth usually hurts."  
“真嗣……虽然你和明日香彼此相爱，但你们都在不知不觉中互相伤害，并被周围的事物所伤害，而这一点在明日香现在所面对的情况下就更不明显了。如果她从未见过你的话，她会经历这些事情吗？如果你从未见过明日香，你会发现你的天使力量和你是亚当的儿子这一事实，即使它们是亚当的儿子？真相，因为真相通常会带来伤害。”

"I'm sorry for everything that I've done, and as I said, I am partially to blame. I showed you how to control your powers, I nudged you along the way, hoping that things would fall into place as they did. But still, you rejected me, you rejected Instrumentality, you rejected the false reality, all for the girl that you love, even though you were uncertain about that love. That girl replied in turn, loving you as you loved her. But the pain of everything will still exist, even with that love there."  
“我对我所做的一切感到抱歉，正如我所说，我也有部分责任。我向你展示了如何控制你的力量，我一路上推动着你，希望事情能像他们所做的那样顺利进行。但你仍然拒绝了我，你拒绝了工具性，你拒绝了虚假的现实，这一切都是为了你所爱的女孩，尽管你不确定那个女孩反过来爱你，就像你爱她一样。即使有那样的爱，一切的痛苦仍然存在。”

"I've decided that I'll help you and Asuka in this regard however, and erase all your memories of each other."  
“不过，我决定在这方面帮助你们和明日香，并抹去你们关于彼此的所有记忆。”

Shinji was silent, thinking that he had heard wrong. Erase there memories of each other? Something like that was...but he cherished those memories he had of Asuka. He didn't want to lose them!  
真嗣沉默了，以为自己听错了。抹去彼此的记忆？类似的事情是……但他很珍惜与明日香有关的那些回忆。他不想失去他们！

"Lilith...that is-" 「莉莉丝……那是——」

"Something which you can't agree with?" asked Lilith.  
“有什么事情你不能同意吗？”莉莉丝问道。

"Of course! I just got Asuka back, and now you say that we should just forget about each other completely? Bullshit!"  
“当然！我刚把明日香带回来，你却说我们应该彻底忘记对方？胡扯！”

"Shinji, think about it this way. Those memories will forever be ingrained in your mind. You are strong, and that is largely thanks to your angel prowess, but Asuka is still human, and having memories from two completely separate moments in her life will torment her until she wont know which one is truly her."  
“真嗣，这样想吧。那些记忆将永远在你的脑海中根深蒂固。你很坚强，这很大程度上要归功于你的天使力量，但明日香仍然是人类，她拥有生命中两个完全不同时刻的记忆会折磨她，直到她分不清哪个才是真正的她。”

"But-" “但-”

"This is all I can do Shinji. It is the only way to take care of Asuka's pain. And you yourself are in pain, even if you don't want to admit it. You locked many things away inside you, but if those were to spill forth suddenly, your rage and anger may break people dear to you. Do you want that?"  
“这就是真嗣所能做的一切。这是解决明日香痛苦的唯一方法。而你自己也很痛苦，即使你不想承认。你把很多东西锁在心里，但如果那些东西如果突然爆发，你的愤怒和愤怒可能会伤害你所爱的人，你愿意吗？”

"No, but-" “不是，但-”

Lilith shook her head and looked down at Asuka.  
莉莉丝摇摇头，低头看着明日香。

"I spoke to her briefly before you arrived here, and told her about my offer. She, like you was hesitant, but I think she believed as I do that even if your memories of each other no longer exist, the love for each other will still remain. Memories may disappear and fade, but the body remembers a person important to it. You and Asuka connected on a level few humans are able to, and even though you are both at such a young age, you were both able to recognize each for who they were. Many humans, and even couples are unable to do this, and don't understand what the other is really thinking. But you and Asuka aren't like that."  
“在你到达这里之前，我和她简短地交谈过，告诉她我的提议。她和你一样犹豫不决，但我想她和我一样相信，即使你们彼此的记忆不再存在，对彼此的爱仍然存在。”记忆可能会消失和褪色，但身体会记住一个对它来说很重要的人，而你和明日香的联系程度是人类无法企及的，尽管你们都那么年轻，但你们都能够做到。许多人类，甚至情侣都做不到这一点，也不明白对方的真实想法，但你和明日香不是这样的。”

"So then...she agreed to it?"  
“那么……她就同意了？”

"Only if you do," replied Lilith. "Ultimately, it has to be both your decisions."  
“只要你愿意，”莉莉丝回答道。 “最终，这必须是你们两个的决定。”

Shinji's eyes moved towards Asuka momentarily gazing at her longingly.  
真嗣的目光移向明日香，一时充满渴望地注视着她。

"Lilith...if I agree to this...what about the other humans. What will happen to them?"  
“莉莉丝……如果我同意了……其他人类呢？他们会怎么样？”

Lilith paused for a brief second and thought about this.  
莉莉丝停顿了一下，思考了这个问题。

"For a time, I shall keep them within the Black Egg until I deem the time ready for the Lilim's rebirth. During that time, you and Asuka will be able to live alone, free from any turmoil. I can give you several years to grow with each other."  
“我会把他们暂时留在黑蛋里，直到我认为莉莉姆重生的时机已经成熟。在那段时间里，你和明日香将能够单独生活，不受任何动乱。我可以给你几年的时间。互相成长。”

"And what of my angel powers? Can you do anything about those?"  
“那我的天使力量呢？你能做点什么吗？”

Lilith's face fell slightly, as she remembered the conversation she had had with Rei.  
想起和雷的对话，莉莉丝的脸色微微沉了下来。

"Unfortunately Shinji, I can't do anything about that, nor could Adam even. You born from Adam and human, and were given the powers of an angel. I don't have any say in the matter. You are you are and will forever be. Even if you memories are gone, that part of you still remains."  
“不幸的是，真嗣，我对此无能为力，甚至亚当也无能为力。你是亚当和人类所生，并被赋予了天使的力量。我在这件事上没有任何发言权。你是你是，即使你的记忆消失了，那部分的你仍然存在。”

"...I see," said Shinji. “……我明白了，”真嗣说道。

Lilith watched Shinji, wondering if she should voice her opinion on the subject, but her and Rei had already talked about that. It wasn't there place to interfere.  
莉莉丝看着真嗣，想知道她是否应该就这个话题发表自己的看法，但她和丽已经谈过了。没有地方可以干涉。

"Then you agree to this?" asked Lilith.  
“那你同意这个吗？”莉莉丝问道。

Shinji once again looked over Asuka; he nodded his head slowly.  
真嗣再次看向明日香。他缓缓地点点头。

"Okay," said Lilith. “好吧，”莉莉丝说。

Standing up, she walked over to Shinji and placed a hand of hers on his head.  
她站起来，走到真嗣身边，将一只手放在他的头上。

"One last thing Lilith...what will you do after this? What will you and Ayanami do?"  
「莉莉丝最后一件事……之后你会做什么？你和绫波会做什么？」

"...I thought about your words, and have decided to search for Adam. He's out there somewhere, and seeing you and Asuka reminded me of times I'd all but forgotten. I'll hold onto the hope that we can become one again. But for the time being, I'll watch over the earth until the Lilim return. Afterwards...well, I'll worry about that when the time comes."  
“......我考虑了你的话，并决定寻找亚当。他就在外面的某个地方，看到你和明日香让我想起了我几乎忘记的那些时光。我会坚持希望我们能够成为但暂时，我会守护地球直到莉莉姆回来……好吧，到时候我会担心的。”

Lilith smiled slightly at Shinji, who couldn't help but smile back.  
莉莉丝对真嗣微微一笑，真嗣也忍不住笑了笑。

"Its been enjoyable seeing you grow into the person you are today," said Lilith. "I wish you and Asuka all the best."  
“看到你成长为今天的样子，我很高兴，”莉莉丝说。 “祝你和明日香一切顺利。”

Lilith then lightly tapped Shinji on the forehead, and whiteness immediately engulfed his mind.  
莉莉丝轻轻拍了拍真嗣的额头，真嗣的脑海立刻一片惨白。

---

At first, Shinji thought that he was inside Asuka's mind again, but as he noticed, things were slightly different. Though everything was white, there was a distinct outline of a wooden bench in the middle of the plane.  
起初，真嗣以为自己又进入了明日香的脑海，但当他注意到时，情况略有不同。虽然一切都是白色的，但飞机的正中央却有着清晰的木凳轮廓。

As Shinji started walking towards it, he felt a light tap on the back of his shoulder and jumped immensely. Spinning around, he saw Asuka standing there, a wide grin on her face. She was wearing her plug suit, and looking down at himself, Shinji noticed that he was wearing his as well.  
当真嗣开始朝它走去时，他感到肩膀后面被轻轻拍了一下，然后跳了起来。转过身来，他看到明日香站在那里，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。她穿着她的紧身衣，低头看着自己，真嗣发现他也穿着他的。

"Jump easily, don't you?" laughed Asuka as she teased him.  
“跳起来很轻松，不是吗？”明日香嘲笑他时笑道。

"What was that for?" “那是干什么用的？”

"Just felt like it," said Asuka as she walked past him. Sitting down on the bench, she patted the spot beside her, indicating that she wanted him to sit next to her. Shinji did so, glancing sideways at her as she did so. Asuka threw her hands behind the bench and stretched her feet out.  
“只是感觉就像这样，”明日香从他身边走过时说道。坐在长凳上，她拍了拍身边的位置，示意他坐到自己身边。真嗣这样做了，同时侧眼看了她一眼。明日香把手放到长凳后面，伸出双脚。

"Ah, it feels good to be wearing a plug suit again."  
“啊，又穿上插头套装了，感觉真好。”

"Says you," mumbled Shinji.  
“你说。”真嗣咕哝道。

"You never did enjoy using the Evangelions."  
“你从来都不喜欢使用新世纪福音战士。”

"And you did?" “你做到了？”

"Well, it was always someplace I could go...and Mama was there of course," said Asuka. "Though of course, meeting you messed that up completely."  
“嗯，总有一个我可以去的地方……当然，妈妈也在那儿，”明日香说。 “当然，遇见你让事情完全搞砸了。”

"Do you regret that?" “你后悔吗？”

"Not at all," said Asuka as she turned and looked at Shinji. "Meeting you was the best thing that has ever happened to me."  
“一点也不。”明日香转身看着真嗣说道。 “遇见你是我这辈子发生过的最好的事情。”

Shinji stared back at her, amazed that she had said such words.  
真嗣回头看着她，很惊讶她会说出这样的话。

"I mean, who else is always going to cook my meals," laughed Asuka.  
“我的意思是，还有谁会一直给我做饭呢？”明日香笑着说。

Shinji sighed; he should have known better than to expected anything else.  
真嗣叹了口气；他应该比预期更清楚地知道其他事情。

But all too suddenly, Asuka's head tilted sideways onto Shinji's shoulder.  
但突然间，明日香的头侧向真嗣的肩膀。

"Asuka?" “明日香？”

"...Will you hold me Shinji?" Asuka whispered through half closed lips.  
「……你能抱抱我吗？」明日香半闭着嘴唇低声说道。

Shinji did so, wrapping an arm around Asuka's shoulder and pulling her close to himself. He then rest his chin on the top of her head and nuzzled it against her silky hair.  
真嗣这样做了，用一只手臂搂住明日香的肩膀，将她拉近自己。然后他将下巴抵在她的头顶上，用鼻子蹭着她柔滑的头发。

"Shinji...I'm scared about the future. Did we make the right decision?"  
“真嗣……我对未来感到害怕。我们做出了正确的决定吗？”

Shinji looked down at Asuka, and saw her eyes wide with fear. He didn't want such an emotion to ever pass through her once again. So-  
真嗣低头看着明日香，看到她的眼睛里充满了恐惧。他不想让这样的情绪再次在她身上流过。所以-

"The pain will be gone," said Shinji as he brushed his lips against her hair.  
“疼痛会消失的，”真嗣一边说，一边用嘴唇拂过她的头发。

"But will we be...will we be able to love each other again?"  
“但是我们……我们还能再次相爱吗？”

Shinji drew his head away from her. Resting his hand on her chin, he tilted her chin upwards so that she was looking at him.  
真嗣把头从她身上移开。他把手放在她的下巴上，抬起她的下巴，让她看着他。

"For us, such a thing is always possible."  
“对我们来说，这样的事情总是有可能的。”

Shinji then leaned down and kissed Asuka sweetly. Even if he forgot, it didn't matter. He wanted this to be the last thing they remembered together.  
真嗣俯下身子，甜蜜地吻住了明日香。就算他忘记了，也没关系。他希望这是他们一起记得的最后一件事。

As Shinji and Asuka broke apart, a bright light from somewhere in the far distance shot outward. Shinji noticed the space they were in start to disappear, almost like when he had left Asuka's mind. But it was fading away, almost like a millions feathers floating in the wind.  
当真嗣和明日香分开时，一道明亮的光芒从远处的某处射出。真嗣注意到他们所在的空间开始消失，就像他离开明日香的脑海一样。但它正在消失，几乎就像数百万根羽毛在风中飘扬。

Shinji wrapped his arms around Asuka then, hugging her tightly. If things were gonna disappear like this, he wanted them to be-  
真嗣伸手搂住明日香，紧紧地拥抱着她。如果事情就这样消失，他希望它们——

"Huh?" “嗯？”

Shinji sat alone on the bench, his arms wrapped around empty space.  
真嗣独自坐在长凳上，双臂环抱着空地。

'What was I?' he wondered.  
“我是什么？”他想知道。

Then the whiteness engulfed him as it had engulfed Asuka.  
然后白色吞没了他，就像吞没了明日香一样。

Lilith sat alone under the Tree of Life. Both Shinji and Asuka lay side by side in an almost comatose like state.  
莉莉丝独自坐在生命之树下。真嗣和明日香并肩躺着，几乎处于昏迷状态。

'Well, things can now progress as they wish,' thought Lilith as she let out a low sigh. Placing a hand over both Shinji's and Asuka's body, she moved them from the Garden of Eden, to the ruins of Tokyo-3 below.  
“好吧，现在事情可以如他们所愿地发展了。”莉莉丝低声叹了一口气。她将一只手放在真嗣和明日香的身上，将他们从伊甸园移至下方的第三东京废墟。

'Now comes the difficult part,' sighed Lilith. Without Shinji's body, Third Impact would crumble away. Even though the Black Egg would remain in tact, she now had to focus all her power into putting humanity to sleep.  
“现在困难的部分来了，”莉莉丝叹了口气。没有真嗣的身体，第三次冲击就会崩溃。尽管黑蛋完好无损，但她现在必须集中所有力量让人类陷入沉睡。

'I suppose I've got my work cut out for me,' thought Lilith. Turning back to the Tree of Life, she stared at it one final time. But she noticed something then.  
“我想我的工作已经完成了，”莉莉丝想。她转回生命之树，最后一次凝视它。但随后她注意到了一些事情。

"Hmph, Adam and Eve huh?"  
“哼，亚当和夏娃啊？”

Two sprouts had appeared on the Tree of Life's withered branches.  
生命之树枯萎的枝条上，已经长出了两根新芽。

'Well, its in there hands now,' thought Lilith.  
“好吧，现在它就在那儿了，”莉莉丝想。

Afterwards, she disappeared from that place, never again to return in any shape or form.  
之后，她就从那个地方消失了，再也没有以任何形式出现过。
