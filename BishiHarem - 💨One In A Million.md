They all seemed the same to her - that is, until he came along. Asuka POV SA  
对她来说，他们似乎都一样——直到他的出现。明日香视角 SA

She could admit it readily; she was quite choosy when it came to dealing with members of the opposite sex. She was well aware of their unworthiness; they weren't _nearly_ up to _her_ needed expectations, not even _close_ to being good enough for her. So was there really a reason in searching? No, she'd long since been tired of the sport. Let the boys drool over her beauty, her intelligence, her remarkable personality! She was fine, just fine.  
她可以坦然承认；在处理异性关系上，她确实相当挑剔。她深知他们的不足；他们远未达到她所需的期望，甚至远远不够格与她相配。那么，寻找真爱真的有必要吗？不，她早已厌倦了这场游戏。就让那些男孩为她倾倒于她的美貌、智慧和非凡个性吧！她很好，真的很好。

She knew all their types: the jocks, the nerds, etc; some with the fascinating ability to turn on the charm the second she walked into the room, others severely lacking this particular talent. She knew what they were all like, and she was bored with them, severely bored. They didn't appeal to her in any way.  
她熟知他们的各种类型：运动员、书呆子等等；有些人拥有一种迷人的能力，她一走进房间就能立刻施展魅力，而另一些人则严重缺乏这种天赋。她知道他们都是什么样的，而且她对他们感到极度厌倦。他们对她没有任何吸引力。

This had led her to make a decision: to never let herself be drawn to a boy that way. It was sign of weakness, and she was far from weak. She was her own symbol of strength, independence.  
这让她做出了一个决定：永远不要让自己那样被一个男孩吸引。那是软弱的表现，而她绝非软弱。她是自己力量的象征，独立的标志。

She didn't need anybody except herself.  
她除了自己，不需要任何人。

So why was it now that she was feeling this way?  
那么为什么她现在会有这种感觉呢？

Attractive? In a way, not flamboyantly striking, just cute, not the type to strut about, parading his looks. Charming? Hardly; rather quiet and shy, reclusive around others. Intelligent? Yes, but with grades plummeting from sheer apathy.  
有吸引力吗？某种程度上，不是那种张扬的引人注目，只是可爱，不是那种四处炫耀自己外表的类型。迷人吗？几乎不；他相当安静害羞，在别人周围很内向。聪明吗？是的，但成绩因为纯粹的冷漠而直线下降。

But he had something none of the others did.  
但他拥有其他所有人都没有的东西。

He could make music that would make you fall to your knees.  
他能创作出让人们跪拜的音乐。

And she hasn't been able to stand since.  
而她自那以后就再也没能站起来。

I know you write ebry once ina blue moon, so being able to read a new piece coming from you is a delectable as being able to taste something that takes great care in being made; you choose your words so wisely I can only stand in awe and read them as slowly as possible to make them last that much longer.  
我知道你一个月才写一篇小说，所以能读到你的新作就像品尝精心制作的美味佳肴一样令人垂涎欲滴；你的用词如此睿智，我只能肃然起敬，并尽可能地慢慢读下去，让它们更持久。

I enjoed this piece inmensely, and don't be surpirsed if it sparks another bout of crappy fics from yours truly.  
我非常喜欢这篇文章，如果它又引发了我的蹩脚小说，请不要感到惊讶。
  
Keep it up kiddo. ;)
继续努力吧，孩子。）

这是一篇非常不错的短篇小说。在时间不多的情况下，读起来很......愉快。7/10. 赞誉

[Caladchbolg](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1161439/Caladchbolg): Fluffier than cotton candy and twice as delicious. O The gaping maw of the SxA fanclub demands more.
比棉花糖还松软，比棉花糖还美味。O SxA 粉丝团张开的大嘴需要更多。

[Incognito girl](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/675427/Incognito-girl): _i love those last lines! now that's classy_ you should really turn this into a series
_我喜欢最后那几句！太有品位了_ 你真应该把它写成一个系列

[theWanderingANBU](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1075568/theWanderingANBU): You have a brilliant way of describing characters really well and the words you use keep the reader intact into reading it. I liked it as a short story, it was great read and I like it. You should definitely do a S/A pairing story that's longer, like 10 chapters or maybe less, whatever you decide. You have a talent and I think I need to put this in a favorites.
你描写人物的方式非常出色，你使用的词语也让读者读得津津有味。我喜欢这篇短篇小说，读起来很棒，我喜欢它。你绝对应该写一个更长的 S/A 配对故事，比如 10 章或者更短，随便你怎么决定。你很有才华，我想我需要把这篇文章放在收藏夹里。

[e4tmyl33t](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1402418/e4tmyl33t): Great. Very good capturing of Asuka's personality, but injecting the emotion she hides so well but truly feels for Shinji.As stated earlier, the SxA fans want more!
太棒了。很好地捕捉到了明日香的个性，同时注入了她隐藏得很好但对真嗣的真挚情感！
