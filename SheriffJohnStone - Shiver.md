> “…研究人员记录到异常的天气现象。他们指出，尽管持续高温，第二次冲击的余波可能会引发突如其来的寒潮…”

葛城少校家的公寓里，电视声不绝于耳，大家都为新的一天做着准备。真嗣忙着做早餐，美里懒洋洋地抓来啤酒，明日香则在一旁等着开饭。

新闻节目的播报引起了红发女孩的注意，她不屑地向当地居民宣告：“日本也能会出现寒冷？说到好像这里真会有冷天气一样。”

大口吞下啤酒后，美里小姐接上了她的话头：“德国那边的气候是挺冷的。”

"哪怕德国如此，那这里也是在地球的另一端！自从我来到这个破城市后，压根就记不得寒冷是怎样的一种体验。"

“谁又能说不是呢，不过你事实上才刚来没多久。”

真嗣在厨房准备着早餐，明日香转过头去盯着他看，于是男孩就听到了又一个挑衅的声音：“那真嗣你怎么看？我们这儿也会变冷吗？”

"我也不太确定，也许会吧？谁又知道使徒是怎样的存在呢？说不定其中一位就能带来雪花。" 这个回答显然没能让提问者感到满意，实际上这样的情景太常见了。

明日香翻了个白眼，不耐烦地耸耸肩说：“你那些话根本毫无意义！我连期待着能有一阵舒爽的凉风拂面都不指望，我知道我肯定没错！”
___

That evening, it started to snow and continued through the night.  
那天傍晚，开始下雪了，并且持续了一整夜。

When Asuka woke up the next morning, she immediately noticed the difference in how light came in through her window. She got up and looked out. Sure enough, Tokyo-3 was blanketed in snow.  
第二天早上，明日香醒来时立刻注意到透过窗户的光线有所不同。她起身向窗外望去。果然，第三新东京市被雪覆盖了。

She moved out into the kitchen, where Shinji and Misato were already awake. The news was playing, and breakfast was sizzling on the stove. "What, not gonna wake me up?"  
她走进厨房，发现真嗣和美里已经醒了。电视正在播放新闻，早餐在炉子上滋滋作响。“怎么，不打算叫醒我吗？”

"I was just about to," said Misato. She was unusually awake at this hour.  
"我正准备这么做呢，" 碇真嗣说。她在这个时间点异常清醒。

Asuka put her hands on her hips. "What the hell is-"  
明日香双手叉腰。"这到底是什么鬼——"

"Shhh!" Misato interrupted, pointing at the TV. Shinji put the food on simmer and poked his head out of the kitchen.  
"嘘！" 碇真嗣打断她，指着电视。真嗣把食物调成小火，从厨房探出头来。

_"As Tokyo-3 citizens continue to wake up today, they will observe that it snowed overnight. People that are driving are encouraged to leave early, and all are encouraged to dress warmly. Meteorologists predict that this snow will continue for the rest of the week."  
"随着第三新东京市的居民今天陆续醒来，他们会发现昨晚下了一场雪。驾车出行的人们被鼓励提早出发，所有人都被建议穿得暖和些。气象学家预测，这场雪将持续到本周末。"_

"What!?" Asuka shouted. "Rest of the week!? I don't have anything warm to wear!"  
"什么！？"明日香大声喊道，"持续到周末！？我根本没有暖和的衣服穿！"

Misato went into her room, coming back out with a thicker coat than the half-jacket she usually wore. "Well, bundle up." Asuka clenched her fists and rushed into the bathroom.  
美里走进自己的房间，拿出一件比平时穿的半身夹克更厚实的外套。"嗯，多穿点。"明日香紧握双拳，冲进了浴室。

When she was done, food was on the table. She sat down and started eating, and Shinji joined her a moment later, a thick coat of his own in hand. Misato sat adjacent, biting into a piece of toast.  
她忙完后，桌上已经摆好了食物。她坐下来开始用餐，不久后，真嗣也加入了她，手里拿着一件厚厚的外套。美里坐在旁边，咬了一口吐司。

Asuka pointed at the coat. "Where the hell did you get that?"  
明日香指着那件外套问道：“你从哪儿弄来的这玩意儿？”

"Oh, my teacher got it for me a few years ago for my birthday."  
“哦，几年前我生日时，我的老师送给我的。”

She said nothing, and sat down to eat, casting glances at Shinji. He was oblivious to this, and when Asuka was looking away, Misato nudged him, motioning to the jacket, then to her. He gave her an uncertain look, which she responded to with a stern eye.  
她什么也没说，坐下来吃饭，不时瞥向真嗣。他对这些目光浑然不觉，当明日香转头时，美里轻轻推了推他，示意他的夹克，然后又指了指她。他给了她一个不确定的眼神，她则以严厉的目光回应。

Shinji sighed. "Asuka?" he spoke up.  
真嗣叹了口气。“明日香？”他开口道。

"What?" "什么？"

"Do you want my jacket?" he said, averting his gaze.  
“你要我的夹克吗？”他说着，目光避开了她。

There was a long pause, but she ground out a quick "Yes."  
沉默良久，但她还是迅速挤出了一个“是”。

---

Shinji and Asuka embarked on their walk to school. He remained in his uniform, but she bundled up in his coat. It was very warm: A long trench coat, lined with wool on the inside. It smelled fairly new but had a faint trace of Shinji.  
真嗣和明日香踏上了去学校的路。他依旧穿着校服，而她则裹着他的外套。那是一件非常暖和的长款风衣，内衬是羊毛。虽然外套闻起来还很新，但隐约带着一丝真嗣的气息。

She spared a sidelong glance at him. He was shivering. It made her look away for a moment. Not like she made him give the coat. He offered.  
她侧目瞥了他一眼，他正在发抖。这让她不由得移开视线片刻。又不是她让他脱下外套的，是他自己主动的。

Instead of facing that, Asuka decided to make conversation. "Sure is cold, huh?"  
"为了避免面对那种尴尬，明日香决定开启话题：“确实挺冷的，对吧？””

Shinji looked at her, his breath causing a little cloud in front of him. "Oh, uh, yeah. Crazy how we were in that volcano just recently."  
真嗣看着她，呼吸在前方形成一小团雾气。“哦，呃，是啊。真疯狂，我们不久前还在那座火山里。”

Asuka offered a smile at the remark. A few weeks ago, he jumped into a volcano to stop her from falling in. It intrigued her how he was capable of bold moves, only choosing not to do them. He had also let her wear his jacket.  
明日香听到这话露出了微笑。几周前，他曾跳进火山以阻止她坠入其中。她对他敢于冒险却选择不做的行为感到好奇。他还让她穿上了他的夹克。

She was brought out of her musings by the chattering of teeth. She looked sidelong at Shinji, whose shivering had worsened. "Do you want this back?"  
她被一阵牙齿打颤的声音从沉思中拉回现实。她斜眼看了看真嗣，他的颤抖愈发严重。“你想把这要回去吗？”

"No, I'm fine," he said, his words shaken by his body.  
"不，我没事，" 他说道，声音因身体的颤抖而显得不稳。

---

Class was full of everyone complaining about the cold. Seemingly, Shinji was one of few people that was actually prepared for such an unusual happening. Asuka noticed a few jealous glances in her direction over the warm coat. She didn't mind, even if it was Shinji's. The school's heating system was unnecessary, so it was non-functional. Asuka kept the coat on the whole day.  
课堂上充斥着大家对寒冷的抱怨声。似乎，真嗣是为数不多真正为这种异常情况做好准备的人之一。明日香注意到有几道羡慕的目光投向她身上的暖和外套。她并不介意，即便那是真嗣的。学校的供暖系统本就多余，因此也处于失效状态。明日香一整天都穿着那件外套。

Needless to say, they were happy to head back to the apartment, where it was a little warmer.  
不用说，他们很高兴返回公寓，那里稍微暖和一些。

As Asuka walked, she could not help but notice Shinji's shivering. It was worse than the morning: his teeth were chattering louder, and he was looking pale.  
当明日香行走时，她不禁注意到真嗣的颤抖。情况比早上更糟：他的牙齿咯咯作响，声音更大，脸色也显得苍白。

"Are you alright?" she asked, telling herself it was out of obligation.  
"你还好吗？"她问道，告诉自己这只是出于义务。

"Y-y-yeah, I'm fine. We're almost home, right?"  
"嗯，我没事。我们快到家了，对吧？"

She sighed. "Whatever. You better not get sick on me!"  
她叹了口气。“随便吧。你可别给我生病了！”

---

When they got into the apartment, Asuka gave Shinji the regular order of making dinner, then stormed to her room. She threw herself onto her bed, and the thickness of the jacket made her realize she was still wearing it.  
进入公寓后，明日香照常命令真嗣去做晚饭，随后怒气冲冲地回到自己房间。她一头栽倒在床上，厚实的外套让她意识到自己还穿着它。

She took off Shinji's jacket and held it out in front of her. It was a nice jacket, she admitted to herself. She hung it on one of her bedposts and decided to watch TV until dinner. As she left the room, she took one last look at the jacket.  
她脱下真嗣的外套，将其展开在面前。她不得不承认，这是一件不错的外套。她将其挂在床柱上，决定看会儿电视直到晚餐时间。离开房间时，她又最后看了一眼那件外套。

---

Asuka sat adjacent to Shinji as the two ate a silent dinner. Misato had called and said not to wait, as she was at NERV helping the city deal with the snow.  
明日香坐在真嗣旁边，两人默默地吃着晚餐。美里打来电话说不用等她，因为她正在 NERV 帮助城市处理积雪问题。

She spared a look at Shinji, noticing he was still pale. "Hey," she said after swallowing a bite of food. "You okay?"  
她瞥了一眼真嗣，注意到他脸色依旧苍白。“嘿，”她咽下一口食物后说道，“你还好吗？”

Shinji glanced up from his meal. He looked tired. "Yeah, I'm okay. Just a little cold."  
真嗣从餐食中抬起头，看起来很疲惫。“嗯，我没事。只是有点冷。”

That made Asuka raise an eyebrow. "Cold!? It's pretty warm in here. You aren't coming down with something, are you?"  
"这让明日香挑了挑眉。“冷？这里挺暖和的啊。你不是感冒了吧？”

He put up his hands. "N-n-no, I'm okay."  
他举起双手。“不，我没事。”

As they finished up their meal, Asuka could not help but notice something: Shinji was shivering again, even while he was talking.  
当他们吃完饭时，明日香不禁注意到一件事：即使是在说话，真嗣又开始颤抖了。

When she went to bed that night, she spared one more thought about it.  
那天晚上她上床睡觉时，又多想了一下这件事。

---

Asuka woke up the next morning and entered an empty kitchen. The growl of her stomach goaded her to storm to Shinji's room.  
明日香第二天早上醒来，走进空无一人的厨房。她肚子里的咕噜声催促着她冲向真嗣的房间。

She flung the door open. "Alright, where's breakfast!?"  
她猛地推开门。“好了，早餐在哪儿！？”

Shinji laid on his futon, tightly curling into the sheets. He let out a low groan.  
真嗣躺在他的蒲团上，紧紧地蜷缩在被单里，发出了一声低沉的呻吟。

It piqued her curiosity. "Idiot-Shinji?"  
这激起了她的好奇心。“傻瓜真嗣？”

"Oh, Asuka," he said, rolling over to face her. "What's going on?"  
“哦，明日香，”他翻身面对她，“怎么了？”

"Well, I was expecting to find you making breakfast, but instead, you're in here."  
"哎呀，我以为你会去做早餐，结果你在这里。"

It made Shinji raise his eyebrows. "Oh, darn. Must've-" He cut himself off to cough. It was a full-on coughing fit, and Asuka didn't like the sound of it.  
这让真嗣挑了挑眉。“哦，糟糕。一定是——”他突然中断，开始咳嗽。一阵剧烈的咳嗽，明日香听着很不舒服。

Before she could say anything, Misato sauntered into the hall, joining her at the doorway. "What's going on?" she asked innocently.  
她还没来得及开口，葛城美里便悠闲地走进大厅，在门口与她汇合。“发生什么事了？”她一脸无辜地问道。

Shinji cleared his throat. "Morning, Misato," he said in a rough voice.  
真嗣清了清嗓子。“早上好，美里，”他用沙哑的声音说道。

Misato gave him a look. "You don't sound very good," she said before entering the room, kneeling at Shinji's side, and putting a hand on his forehead. "Oh no, you're burning up, too. I'll get the thermometer." She stood. "If your temperature's too high, we'll take you to NERV to see a doctor." While this happened, Asuka slowly moved into Shinji's room, sitting against the wall and watching him tremble in his sheets.  
美里看了他一眼，“你听起来不太好，”她说着走进房间，跪在真嗣身边，用手摸了摸他的额头，“哦不，你也在发烧。我去拿体温计。”她站起身，“如果体温太高，我们就带你去 NERV 看医生。”与此同时，明日香缓缓走进真嗣的房间，靠墙坐下，注视着他在被单中颤抖。

A moment later, Shinji was handed an electric thermometer, and it clamped under his armpit. When it beeped, Misato checked it. "40 degrees."  
片刻后，真嗣被递给了一个电子体温计，将其夹在腋下。当体温计发出哔哔声时，美里检查了它。“40 度。”

"What's that mean?" 那是什么意思？

"That means you have a nasty fever," she said. "Get dressed. We're going to the doctor."  
“那就意味着你发高烧了，”她说，“快穿好衣服，我们去看医生。”

Asuka decided to tag along.  
明日香决定一起去。

---

The NERV infirmary was quiet. It was a Wednesday morning, and half of the staff was either late or absent due to snow. Ritsuko found them an available doctor to do a check-up on Shinji. The girls sat on chairs against the wall, while Shinji waited on the patient's chair.  
NERV 医务室静悄悄的。那是一个周三的早晨，半数员工因雪迟到或缺席。律子为他们找到了一位可用的医生来为真嗣做检查。女孩们坐在靠墙的椅子上，而真嗣则坐在病人椅上等待。

A lady walked in with a clipboard. "Good morning. My name is doctor Kitakami. You're Shinji, right?"  
一位女士拿着写字板走了进来。"早上好，我是北神医生。你是真嗣，对吧？"

"Yes ma'am." 是的，女士。

"Hi, Shinji. Can you tell me what symptoms you've been having?"  
你好，真嗣。你能告诉我你最近有哪些症状吗？

"Well, a cough, and I've been really cold. Then this morning I woke up with a fever."  
嗯，我咳嗽了，而且感觉特别冷。然后今天早上醒来时，我发现自己在发烧。

Dr. Kitakami grabbed a stethoscope, and asked Shinji to take his shirt off. he was embarrassed to do it in front of Misato and Asuka, opting to look away. She put the stethoscope to his exposed chest and made him breathe in and out while she checked in various spots.  
北神医生抓起听诊器，让真嗣脱掉衬衫。在美里和明日香面前，他感到尴尬，选择转过头去。她将听诊器贴在他裸露的胸膛上，让他深呼吸，同时检查不同部位。

"Hmm," said Kitakami. "Something doesn't sound quite right."  
"嗯，" 北上说道，"感觉有点不对劲。"

"What do you mean?" asked Shinji. He was shivering again.  
"你什么意思？" 真嗣问道，他又开始颤抖了。

She wrote something down on her clipboard. "I think you should get an x-ray. Your breathing doesn't sound as clear as it should."  
她在写字板上记了些什么。“我认为你应该去拍个 X 光。你的呼吸听起来不如应有的清晰。”

He nodded slowly. "Okay." What was the worst that could happen?  
他缓缓地点了点头。“好吧。”最坏的情况又能怎样呢？

---

After a long, cold x-ray, Shinji sat in the check-up room again. Kitakami held up a pair of graphs, pointing at the particles on the scans of his chest. "Pneumonia."  
经过漫长而寒冷的 X 光检查后，真嗣再次坐在了检查室里。北上举起一对图表，指着他的胸部扫描图上的粒子。“肺炎。”

His eyes filled with panic. "What?"  
他的眼中充满了恐慌。“什么？”

"Bacterial pneumonia. Thankfully, you caught it early. I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotics. Take them as directed on the label, and make sure to rest," said Kitakami.  
“细菌性肺炎。幸好你发现得早。我会给你开一些抗生素。请按照标签上的指示服用，并确保好好休息。” 北上说道。

Shinji groaned. "Ugh. Must be because of the cold."  
真嗣呻吟了一声。“呃，肯定是因为太冷了。”

"Well, not quite. While it's not the best conditions out, you can't get pneumonia from being cold. Only from breathing it in. I'm going to put you on Amoxicillin. Just rest, drink warm fluids, and stay out of this cold." She handed the prescription form to Misato and sent the three on their way.  
嗯，也不尽然。虽然外面条件不是最好，但受凉并不会导致肺炎，只有吸入才会。我会给你开阿莫西林。好好休息，喝点温热的液体，别再受这寒气了。她将处方单递给美里，然后送三人离开。

The diagnosis was eyebrow-raising for Asuka, but upon hearing that it wasn't from the cold, she felt a little better. She pushed down her guilt, and looked at Shinji as they walked; He was draped in one of Misato's jackets, as well as a hoodie. He was frail, compared to the boy who fought at her side in sorties.  
对于明日香来说，这个诊断结果令人震惊，但得知并非感冒所致，她稍感宽慰。她压抑住内心的愧疚，边走边看向真嗣；他披着一件美里的大衣，还套着一件连帽衫。与那个曾与她并肩作战的男孩相比，他显得如此虚弱。

Misato got the prescription. On the way to the car, she turned to her wards. "Sorry, kids. I gotta stay and work. Angel aftermath and all that. I can drive you home, but I'll see you later."  
美里拿到了处方。在前往汽车的路上，她转向她的监护对象们说：“抱歉，孩子们，我得留下来工作，处理天使事件的善后事宜。我可以开车送你们回家，但稍后再见。”

"What!? You're making _me_ take care of this goof!?" said Asuka.  
"什么！？你要我照顾这个傻瓜！？" 阿苏卡说道。

"Hey, I'll call the school and let them know you're exempt."  
嘿，我会给学校打电话，告诉他们你免除了。

Asuka grumbled a little but accepted. "...Fine."  
明日香嘟囔了几句，但还是接受了。"...好吧。

---

As soon as the kids got into the apartment, Shinji slipped his shoes off, placed the pills on the kitchen counter, and trudged to his room, clutching Misato's jacket as he held it tightly around himself.  
孩子们一进公寓，真嗣就脱掉鞋子，把药片放在厨房台面上，然后拖着沉重的步伐走向自己的房间，紧紧裹着美里的大衣。

Asuka watched him and moved to the living room when he was out of sight. She plopped herself down on a beanbag chair and tried to relax.  
明日香注视着他，待他身影消失后便走向客厅。她一屁股坐在豆袋椅上，试图放松自己。

The TV droned on about the snow, but Asuka's mind wandered to her resting roommate. A part of her insisted she had a responsibility. Technically, she did, by order of Misato, but there wasn't anything she could do while Shinji slept the day away, right?  
电视里还在喋喋不休地报道着雪情，但明日香的思绪却飘向了正在休息的室友。她内心的一部分坚持认为她有责任。从技术上讲，根据美里大人的命令，她确实有责任，但在真嗣睡上一整天的时候，她又能做些什么呢？

She answered her own question by getting up and moving to the hallway.  
她通过起身走向走廊来回答了自己的问题。

---

Shinji's door was open a crack. Asuka peeked in and saw him lying in a mess of blankets. He appeared to be trying to fall asleep with little success.  
真嗣的房门微微敞开。明日香探头望去，只见他躺在凌乱的被褥中，似乎正努力尝试入睡，却收效甚微。

She opened the door and leaned in. "Idiot-Shinji?" she whispered.  
她推开门，探身进去。“笨蛋真嗣？”她轻声唤道。

She saw him open his eyes. "Oh, hey, Asuka."  
她看到他睁开了眼睛。“哦，嘿，明日香。”

"You okay in here?" "你在这里还好吗？"

"Um..." he hesitated. "I think I forgot to take the antibiotic."  
“呃……”他犹豫了一下，“我想我忘记吃抗生素了。”

That made her scowl. "You dumbass!"  
这让她皱起了眉头。“你个蠢货！”

"Sorry." “对不起。”

"You better be! God, what would you do without me!?" she said, storming to the kitchen.  
你最好是的！天啊，没有我你怎么办！？" 她说着，怒气冲冲地走向厨房。

While she was out of the doorway, Shinji smiled a little. "...I dunno."  
当她走出门口时，真嗣微微一笑。“...我不知道。”

Asuka returned immediately after with a pill and a glass of water. "Sit up."  
明日香很快就带着药丸和一杯水回来了。"坐起来。"

Shinji complied, trying his best to ease the dizziness that came on as he sat up. He accepted the pill, placing it on his tongue before taking the water cup with both hands to wash it down. He handed the cup back to Asuka. "Ugh, thank you."  
真嗣顺从地照做，尽力缓解坐起时袭来的眩晕感。他接过药片，放在舌头上，然后双手捧起水杯将其冲下。随后，他将杯子递还给明日香，"呃，谢谢你。"

"Don't mention it," she said. Shinji laid back down, and Asuka lingered at the door for a little, but something made her hesitate. After a moment, she bit the bullet. "Anything I can, uh, do for you?"  
"不用谢，" 她说道。真嗣重新躺下，而明日香在门口逗留了一会儿，但某种东西让她犹豫不决。片刻后，她鼓起勇气问道："有什么我能，呃，帮你的吗？"

"Maybe later..." Shinji mumbled. He offered a clumsy smile. "Thanks again."  
"可能晚些时候吧……" 真嗣喃喃自语，露出了一个笨拙的微笑。"再次感谢。"

Asuka couldn't resist a small smile as she exited the room.  
明日香走出房间时，忍不住露出一丝微笑。

---

A couple of hours of studying and TV later, Asuka was brought to focus by the growl of her stomach. She reasoned that if she was hungry, so was Shinji.  
几小时的学习和电视时间过后，明日香被自己肚子的咕噜声拉回了注意力。她想，如果自己饿了，那么真嗣肯定也饿了。

She got up and went to his room to ask, as per her job. Purely obligation. She slid the door open. "Hey, Shinji?"  
她起身前往他的房间询问，这是她的职责所在。纯粹出于义务。她轻轻推开门，“嘿，真嗣？”

He stirred. "Oh, hey Asuka." She got a good look at him; He was coated in blankets, with just his head and arms sticking out of the tangle of covers. There was a sheen of sweat on his forehead, and his hair was a mess. He looked like a mess.  
他动了动。“哦，嘿，明日香。”她这才看清他；他全身裹着毯子，只有头和手臂从那堆凌乱的被褥中伸出。额头上有一层薄汗，头发乱糟糟的。看起来一团糟。

The question about dinner died on Asuka's lips "Are you okay?"  
关于晚餐的询问在明日香嘴边戛然而止：“你还好吗？”

Shinji forced a smile "Yeah, I'm fine," he said, which was an obvious lie.  
真嗣勉强挤出一个笑容，“嗯，我没事，”他说道，这显然是句谎言。

Such a display made Asuka shake her head. She crossed the threshold into his room and sat down next to his bed. She loomed over his lying form, getting a close look at him. Despite sleeping for a few hours, he still looked exhausted, and he was still sweating.  
这样的情景让明日香摇了摇头。她跨过门槛走进他的房间，坐在他的床边。她俯身靠近他躺着的身体，仔细端详着他。尽管已经睡了几个小时，他看起来依旧疲惫不堪，额头上还挂着汗珠。

In his delirium, Shinji let slip what was on his mind. "You smell nice, Asuka," he said, a look of pure bliss on his face. "I like it."  
在神志不清的状态下，真嗣无意中吐露了心声。“你闻起来很香，明日香，”他脸上洋溢着纯粹的幸福说道，“我喜欢这个味道。”

The comment caught Asuka off-guard. Her heart jumped, and she stumbled back. "I... I'm gonna go start dinner. We're having soup!"  
那句话让明日香措手不及，她的心猛地一跳，不由自主地后退了几步。“我……我去准备晚饭。今晚我们吃汤！”

Shinji watched her leave his room, the light from the hallway flooding his sight.  
真嗣目送她离开自己的房间，走廊的灯光涌入他的视野。

---

Asuka hurried to the kitchen. She laid out the ingredients and began to prep some tomato soup. When she was little, someone had taught her this recipe, and she recalled always enjoying making it. Why not spread that enjoyment to Shinji?  
明日香急忙走进厨房，摆好食材开始准备番茄汤。小时候有人教过她这个食谱，她一直很喜欢做这道汤。何不将这份乐趣分享给真嗣呢？

She got to work: Plenty of tomatoes, plenty of onions, a little bit of butter and some extra seasoning, and it came together rather quickly. Either that, or she was having fun making soup for Shinji. She shrugged it off and carefully ladled some soup into two bowls.  
她开始动手：大量的番茄，大量的洋葱，少许黄油和一些额外的调味料，很快就煮好了。要么是这样，要么是她做汤给真嗣吃感到乐趣。她耸了耸肩，小心翼翼地将汤舀进两个碗里。

Asuka set the bowls adjacent. She walked over to Shinji's room, where he was sitting on his bed.  
明日香将碗摆放在旁边。她走到真嗣的房间，只见他正坐在床上。

"Dinner." 晚餐。

"'Kay." “好的。”

---

Asuka watched Shinji out of the corner of her eye. He was still shivering a little, but it was a little more subdued as he slurped the soup.  
明日香用眼角余光观察着真嗣。他仍在微微颤抖，但随着他喝汤的动作，颤抖有所缓和。

"How is it?" she asked, masking her curiosity.  
"怎么样？"她问道，掩饰着她的好奇心。

He looked at her, a mouthful of soup. "Mm." He swallowed. "It's good. Thank you," he said, a weak smile on his face.  
他看着她，嘴里含着一口汤。“嗯。”他咽了下去。“很好吃，谢谢你，”他脸上露出一丝虚弱的微笑。

"Really?" “真的吗？”

"Yeah! The tomatoes stand out nicely, and there's a hint of onion. It's great!"  
耶！番茄很突出，还有一丝洋葱的味道。太棒了！

"I'm glad you like my food," she said proudly.  
"我很高兴你喜欢我的食物，" 她自豪地说。

"Oh, I'd eat anything you make," he said, before suddenly closing his mouth. He wiped some sweat with the back of his hand.  
"哦，你做的我都吃，"他说完，突然闭上了嘴。他用手背擦了擦汗。

The rest of the meal was relatively quiet, with hints of small talk, but it bore none of the tension that bubbled up from time to time. She even noticed that he was looking at her, much like how he was before.  
整顿饭下来相对安静，偶有闲聊，但不再有之前不时涌现的紧张气氛。她甚至注意到，他正像以前那样注视着她。

Shinji leaned back when he was done. "Ah, that was great. Thank you, Asuka."  
真嗣完成后向后一靠，说道：“啊，太棒了。谢谢你，明日香。”

"Don't get used to it," she said. "Just rest, okay? Isn't that what Misato said?"  
"别习惯了，"她说，"就休息一下，好吗？这不是 Misato 说的吗？"

"Right, right. Goodnight."  
好的，好的。晚安。

"Night, Third." 夜，第三。

Shinji stood and trudged to the bathroom. Asuka began on dishes. She thought about the snow. The apartment had no heaters, so she felt the chill at that moment. It made Asuka recall the warmth of eating the soup with Shinji. Delirious or not, he wasn't so bad to be around.  
真嗣起身拖着沉重的步伐走向浴室。明日香开始洗碗，她想起了外面的雪。公寓里没有暖气，那一刻她感到了寒意。这让明日香回忆起与真嗣一起喝汤时的温暖。无论他是否神志不清，和他在一起并不算太糟。

The way he looked at her was different, too. It was different from the pervy ogle she was accustomed to. It was a subtler look of admiration, one she had not seen before. It made her question if he always looked at her like that.  
他看她的方式也变了。不同于她习以为常的猥琐窥视，这是一种更为微妙的赞赏目光，她以前从未见过。这让她不禁怀疑，他是否一直这样看着她。

Shinji exited the bathroom. "Goodnight," he said again.  
真嗣走出浴室，再次说道：“晚安。”

"Night." 夜。

While Asuka dried off the dishes, she kept his glance in her mind.  
当明日香擦干盘子时，她心中一直留着他的目光。

---

The next few days were much of the same: Between miscellaneous activities around the apartment, Asuka would ask Shinji if he needed anything, then squeeze a straight answer out of him.  
接下来的几天大致相同：在公寓周围的各种杂务间隙，明日香会询问真嗣是否需要什么，然后从他那里挤出一个直截了当的回答。

"Shinji, are you good?" she asked.  
"真嗣，你还好吗？" 她问道。

"Yeah, I'm fine right now," he would say, followed by a coughing fit.  
"嗯，我现在没事，"他会说，紧接着就是一阵咳嗽。

"...Tea?" "...茶？"

"I can get it myself."  
我自己能拿到。

"No, you can't." "不，你不能。"

"Yes I-" More coughing. "Can!"  
"是的，我——"" 又是一阵咳嗽。 ""可以！"

"Listen up, you idiot. Misato put it in my hands to help you out. If you get up and do everything yourself, what am I for?"  
听着，你这笨蛋。是美里让我来帮你的。如果你站起来什么都自己干，那我还有什么用？

"Are you sure?" “你确定吗？”

"Yes! You're sick! You're supposed to be resting. Don't think you're a burden just because you have to ask for my help. I'm not at school, am I?"  
对！你生病了！你应该休息。别以为你需要我的帮助就成了负担。我又不在学校，不是吗？

"No."

"That's right! So why wouldn't I help you?"  
没错！那我为什么不帮你呢？

"Sorry." “对不起。”

"Oh, save it. I'll be right back."  
哦，省省吧。我马上回来。

Multiple similar instances happened over the few days that followed. All was well.  
接下来的几天里，类似的情况屡次发生。一切安好。

Near the end of the week, Asuka lay in bed, letting herself wake up a little before checking on Shinji. He was starting to turn a corner, which was nice. He had some of his energy back.  
周末将近时，明日香躺在床上，让自己稍稍醒来后再去查看真嗣的情况。他开始有所好转，这让人感到欣慰。他的精力也恢复了一些。

Asuka heard the front door open and close. That was probably Misato leaving for work. She decided it would be a good time to get up. She rubbed her eyes and got out of her room to go see how Shinji was doing.  
明日香听到前门打开又关上，那应该是美里去上班了。她觉得这是个起床的好时机。她揉了揉眼睛，走出房间去看看真嗣怎么样了。

"Hey, Mister 'I'm fine', how's it-" she said as she opened a door to an empty bedroom. She turned her head "Shinji?" she called out to the apartment. Asuka picked up the pace, checking the other rooms.  
“嘿，先生‘我没事’，怎么样了——”她边说边打开一扇门，里面是间空卧室。她转过头来，“真嗣？”她向公寓里喊道。明日香加快了脚步，检查着其他房间。

When she saw Shinji's jacket was missing, it dawned on her: He had left the apartment. "God dammit!" she said as she threw on some shoes and rushed out, calling the elevator as fast as she could. The ride to the ground floor felt like forever.  
当她发现真嗣的外套不见了，她恍然大悟：他已经离开了公寓。“该死！”她一边咒骂，一边匆忙穿上鞋子，冲出去，尽可能快地呼叫电梯。到达一楼的那段路程仿佛永无止境。

---

Asuka ran out into the snow. Her breath was visible and her socks were getting wet. She reached the sidewalk and looked each way.  
明日香跑进了雪地，她的呼吸清晰可见，袜子也渐渐湿透。她来到人行道上，左右张望。

In the distance, she saw a small figure walking slowly. Without another thought, she started running as fast as she could through the snow, coldness be damned.  
远处，她看到一个小小的身影缓缓走来。顾不得多想，她开始在雪地中全力奔跑，寒冷全然不顾。

She ran ahead of the figure, taking a few steps to come to a halt. She turned and faced them, and sure enough, it was Shinji. He looked pale and had bags under his eyes. "Wha- Oh, uh, hi Asuka," he said.  
她跑在那个身影前面，几步之后停了下来。她转身面对他们，果不其然，是真嗣。他面色苍白，眼袋明显。“什——哦，呃，嗨，明日香。”他说道。

Asuka clenched her fists. "What the hell are you doing!?"  
明日香紧握双拳。“你到底在搞什么鬼！？”

"We were out of tea."  
我们的茶喝完了。

"Okay? Why didn't you just ask me to get more?"  
"好的？你为什么不直接让我多拿一些呢？"

Shinji broke eye contact for a moment. "You were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you up."  
真嗣短暂地避开了眼神接触。“你在睡觉。我不想吵醒你。”

Asuka took a few steps closer to him. She started jabbing at his chest with her finger. "You're supposed to be resting, and, for God's sake, not going out in the freezing cold! Do you want to get better!?"  
明日香向他走近了几步，开始用手指戳他的胸口。“你应该在休息，看在上帝的份上，不是在这种冰天雪地里出门！你想不想好起来了！？”

"Yes." "是。"

"Then..." she hesitated. Looking in his face, he had that 'kicked puppy' look some of the girls from school had talked about. It made yelling at him a little bit tougher, but then she remembered why she was mad. "Then stay in the damn apartment!" Before Shinji could react, she stormed past him, grabbing him tightly by the wrist and dragging him back.  
"那么..." 她犹豫了一下。看着他的脸，他露出了那种学校里有些女生谈论过的'被踢的小狗'的表情。这让朝他大吼变得有些困难，但她随即想起了自己为何生气。"那就给我待在公寓里！" 没等真嗣反应过来，她怒气冲冲地从他身边走过，紧紧抓住他的手腕，拽着他往回走。

---

Asuka finally let go of Shinji's wrist when they were in the apartment. She pulled him into the kitchen, where he leaned on a chair. She paced the floor in front of him, before snapping to look at him. "Just what the hell were you thinking!?"  
当他们回到公寓后，明日香终于放开了真嗣的手腕。她把他拉进厨房，他靠在一张椅子上。她在他的面前来回踱步，然后突然停下，怒视着他。"你到底在想什么！？"

He looked down. "I don't know, I just... I just didn't want to make you get out of bed for my tea."  
他低头说道：“我不知道，我只是...只是不想让你为了我的茶从床上起来。”

"Look at me. You were gonna go out in the freezing cold? Don't you remember what the doctor said!?"  
看着我。你打算在这么冷的天出去？你忘了医生怎么说的了吗！？

"I know, I know, 'Stay out of the cold.' I'm sorry."  
我知道，我知道，“别待在冷风里。”对不起。

Asuka clenched her fist again. She took a breath. She unclenched and put a hand on his now-cold forehead. "I'm gonna go get your damned tea. Gimme the jacket."  
明日香再次握紧拳头，深吸一口气，然后松开手，将一只手放在他已冰冷的额头上。“我去给你拿那该死的茶。把夹克给我。”

"Uh, okay." Once in his hands, Asuka snatched the jacket and slipped it over her shoulders.  
"呃，好吧。" 一旦落入他手中，明日香便一把夺过夹克，迅速披在肩上。

She almost exited, but turned back to him. "Wanna do something for me? Lie down and bundle up, for the love of God!"  
她差点离开，却又转身面向他：“能帮我个忙吗？看在上帝的份上，躺下把自己裹起来！”

"Yes ma'am." 是的，女士。

"I guess I'll get stuff for dinner too. Please don't force me to make fish."  
我想我也得准备晚餐的食材了。请别逼我做鱼。

"How about ramen?" "拉面怎么样？"

"...Sure." Asuka made a quick list of things to buy and rushed out to the store. She bundled herself up in Shinji's jacket and didn't take it off until she returned.  
"……好吧。" 明日香迅速列了个购物清单，急匆匆地赶往商店。她裹上真嗣的外套，直到回来才脱下。

---

Asuka walked back towards the apartment, two grocery bags in hand. One bag held enough tea for months, while the other had the night's ingredients.  
明日香提着两个购物袋走回公寓。一个袋子里装着足够喝上数月的茶叶，而另一个袋子里则是当晚所需的食材。

Shinji's jacket clung to her. It was thick and comfortable and retained a little of its Shinji-essence. Above all, it was warm. It kept her from succumbing to shivers as she finally arrived back at the apartment building.  
真嗣的外套紧紧裹着她。它厚实而舒适，还保留着一丝真嗣的气息。最重要的是，它很温暖。正是这份温暖，让她在终于回到公寓楼时，不至于因寒意而颤抖。

The elevator ascended the and she picked up the pace to get into the apartment. "I'm home!" she said. No answer. She swore to herself that she'd kill that idiot if he wandered off again. "Hey, Shinji?" She put the bags down and poked her head into the living room.  
电梯缓缓上升，她加快脚步走进公寓。“我回来了！”她喊道。无人应答。她暗自发誓，如果那个白痴再乱跑，她一定要杀了他。“嘿，真嗣？”她放下袋子，探头望向客厅。

Shinji laid on a beanbag chair, wrapped in a blanket. He was asleep. Asuka decided not to pester him for the moment and returned to the kitchen. She found an electric kettle in the cupboard, filled it with water and plugged it in. She picked out a tea bag and put it aside. While the water boiled, she put away the other groceries for the time being.  
真嗣躺在豆袋椅上，裹着毯子睡着了。明日香决定暂时不去打扰他，转身回到厨房。她在橱柜里找到一个电热水壶，装满水后插上电源。她挑选了一个茶包放在一旁。等待水烧开的同时，她暂时将其他杂货收拾好。

The kettle beeped. She found the mug Shinji had been using and plopped the teabag in. She filled it with steaming hot water and finished up organizing the groceries. She picked up the tea, hovering a hand underneath it as she carried it to the living room.  
水壶发出哔哔声。她找到了真嗣一直在用的杯子，放入茶包，注入滚烫的热水，随后整理好杂货。她端起茶杯，一手托底，小心翼翼地将其端到客厅。

Asuka came upon the sleeping form of Shinji and nudged him with her foot. "I have tea."  
明日香发现真嗣正在熟睡，便用脚轻轻碰了碰他。“我泡了茶。”

"Mmngh, Asuka?" "嗯唔，明日香？"

"Yes, hello." 是的，你好。

"Oh, you have tea." He sat up, putting his hands out to accept it. "Thank you." he let out a concerning cough, before taking a big sip, letting the fluid blaze down his throat. He smiled at Asuka.  
“哦，你有茶。”他坐起身，伸出手来接过茶杯。“谢谢。”他发出一声令人担忧的咳嗽，随后大口喝下，任由液体灼烧着喉咙。他对着明日香微笑。

It was that look again. Asuka found herself reciprocating the smile, just a little.  
又是那种眼神。明日香发现自己不由自主地回以微笑，尽管只是浅浅的一抹。

---

When Shinji insisted on cooking dinner, he was shot down vehemently by Asuka but managed to compromise, and she allowed him to direct her from a chair. He sat, wrapped in a blanket with a cup of tea, while she added ingredients and stirred.  
当真嗣坚持要准备晚餐时，遭到了明日香激烈的反对，但最终他还是设法达成了妥协，她允许他坐在椅子上指导她。他裹着毯子，手里端着一杯茶，而她则负责添加食材和搅拌。

When it was ready, she set the table and placed the bowls down.  
准备就绪后，她摆好餐桌，将碗一一放置。

"Thank you," he said. "谢谢你，"他说。

"Thank me?" Asuka gave Shinji a look. "I hardly did anything, I just followed what you did."  
"谢我？"明日香看了真嗣一眼，"我也没做什么，只是跟着你做的而已。"

He huffed. "But you still had to do things, so thank you."  
他哼了一声。“但你还是得做事，所以谢谢你。”

"Fine. Thank you too, then."  
好的，那也谢谢你了。

The two ate, and Shinji offered some commentary. "Mm! Good choice on the pork broth! Really brings out the flavour!"  
两人用餐时，真嗣发表了一些评论：“嗯！选猪肉汤底真是明智，确实能带出风味！”

Asuka grinned. "Oh? Tell me more."  
明日香咧嘴一笑：“哦？多告诉我一些。”

"...And the garlic, you added just enough that it accents the noodles well!"  
"...而那蒜末，你加得恰到好处，完美地衬托了面条的风味！"

"Thank you, mister food critic," she said.  
"谢谢您，美食评论家先生，" 她说道。

"Oh. Uh, sorry." Shinji's eyes fell to his food.  
"哦。呃，对不起。" 真嗣的目光落到了他的食物上。

"Don't be. I'm glad it's good too."  
别这样。我也高兴这很好。

Before she knew it, the noodles were all gone.  
不知不觉间，面条已经吃完了。

Shinji finished at about the same time. He looked up from his meal, which had become a few stray noodles at the bottom of an empty broth bowl. "Asuka?"  
真嗣也差不多同时吃完。他抬头看向自己的餐盘，那里只剩下几根散落的拉面在空荡荡的汤碗底部。“明日香？”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"I just," his voice sounded thick. "I just wanted to thank you for all the help these last few days. I'm sorry I got sick, I didn't mean to. But, uh, you're great. Honestly."  
“我，”他的声音听起来有些沙哑，“我只是想感谢你这几天给予的所有帮助。对不起，我生病了，我不是故意的。但是，呃，你真的很棒。真的。”

Asuka chuckled. "You don't need to thank me, but you're welcome."  
明日香轻笑道：“你不用谢我，不过不客气。”

"And," Shinji continued. She heard him take a shaky breath. "I realized I... You're really cool. I like spending time with you." His face was red. The last week, as well as the battle in the volcano, made her realize that being around Shinji was not only fun but also comforting. Her heart skipped a beat at the realization.  
“而且，”真嗣继续说道。她听到他颤抖地吸了一口气。“我意识到我……你真的很酷。我喜欢和你在一起的时光。”他的脸红了。过去的一周，以及在火山中的战斗，让她意识到和真嗣在一起不仅有趣，还让人感到安慰。意识到这一点，她的心跳漏了一拍。

"I do too. You may not be as smart as me, which, high bar." That prompted a chuckle. "-But you're alright, Third." Asuka smiled. She brushed her thumb against his hand. "These last few days have been pretty fun," she said, looking off to the side.  
我也这么觉得。你可能没我聪明，那可是高标准哦。"这话引得他轻笑一声。"——不过你挺好的，三郎。"明日香微笑着，用拇指轻抚他的手。"最近这几天挺有趣的，"她侧目说道。

"Maybe we could spend time like this when I'm not sick?"  
或许在我没生病的时候，我们也能这样共度时光？

Asuka reached over and flicked his nose, "Just as long as you don't pull a stunt like the one you pulled today. Must I always be saving your ass?"  
明日香伸手弹了一下他的鼻子，说：“只要你别再像今天这样耍花招就行。我非得总是来救你不可吗？”

"I wouldn't mind," Shinji blurted out. The two of them sat in silence for a moment, looking at each other. Shinji fidgeted with his hands, Asuka shifted in her seat.  
"“我倒是不介意，”真嗣脱口而出。两人沉默地坐了一会儿，互相看着对方。真嗣摆弄着双手，明日香在座位上动了动。”

"Well," she said to break the silence. "I'm gonna do the dishes."  
"嗯，" 她开口打破沉默，"我去洗碗。"

He stood. "I'll help!" 他站起身来，"我也来帮忙！"

"No, you won't. Go sit."  
不，你不会的。去坐下。

Shinji tried to protest, but Asuka made him agree to clear the table and nothing more. He went back to the living room, leaving a free beanbag chair for her.  
真嗣试图抗议，但明日香让他同意只是清理桌子，别无其他。他回到客厅，给她留下了一个空着的豆袋椅。

When Asuka was done, she threw herself down next to Shinji. A game show played on TV.  
当明日香忙完后，她一头倒在真嗣旁边。电视上正播放着一档游戏节目。

"What'cha watching?" “你在看什么呢？”

He looked at her. "Nothing really. This was just on."  
他看着她。“没什么，只是碰巧发生了。”

"Well, it's too cold for anything else. How about a movie? I know they have channels for that."  
嗯，天气太冷，不适合做别的。看场电影怎么样？我知道有专门的频道可以看。

"Sure. I don't know movies, so you can find something."  
当然可以。我对电影不太了解，你来挑一部吧。

"Gladly." She scooted a little closer to him. She pointed the remote at the TV and hit 'next' until she found a channel playing movie about a fierce girl who was raised by wolves.  
"乐意之至。" 她向他挪近了些，拿起遥控器对着电视按下“下一个”，直到找到一个正在播放关于一个被狼养大的凶猛女孩的电影频道。

"She's cool," said Shinji at one point. "I like how tough she is."  
"她很酷，" 真嗣在某一刻说道，"我喜欢她那种坚韧。"

Asuka kept a content smile.  
明日香保持着满足的微笑。

---

When the movie ended, Asuka looked over to Shinji. He was bundled up in blankets, but he wasn't shivering nearly as much.  
电影结束时，明日香看向真嗣。他裹着毯子，但几乎不再发抖了。

"Hey," she said. "You alright? And don't lie," she added.  
“嘿，”她说，“你还好吗？别撒谎，”她补充道。

"Actually, yeah. I feel okay. Just-" He yawned. "Just tired."  
其实，是的。我感觉还好。只是——" 他打了个哈欠，"只是有点累。"

Asuka stood, "Well, let's get to bed, shall we?" she said, offering a hand. Shinji took it and stood. "You can get ready first."  
明日香站起身，“好了，我们去睡觉吧，怎么样？”她说着，伸出手。真嗣握住她的手，也站了起来。“你先去准备吧。”

"Thanks. I won't be long," he said. He shed his blanket and headed to the bathroom.  
"谢谢，我很快就好。" 他说着，放下毯子，朝浴室走去。

Asuka sat at the table and watched the door. Despite herself, she couldn't help but think about Shinji, and how he was smiling at her. His words at dinner popped into her head as well. It was nice.  
明日香坐在桌边，目光紧盯着门。尽管她不愿承认，但脑海中还是不由自主地浮现出真嗣的笑容，以及他对自己微笑的情景。晚餐时他的话语也突然在心头响起，那感觉真好。

Shinji re-emerged rather quickly. She shook her thoughts and stood. "Thanks for not keeping me waiting."  
真嗣很快就重新出现了。她摇了摇头，站起身来。“谢谢你没有让我久等。”

"Oh, no problem," said Shinji. She walked past him and went into the bathroom.  
“哦，没问题，”真嗣说道。她从他身边走过，进了浴室。

As she brushed her teeth and washed her face, she looked up at herself in the mirror. Her eyes wandered to the door behind her. Being in the apartment with Shinji turned out to not be as bad as she expected. Again, she smiled.  
她刷牙洗脸时，抬头望向镜中的自己。目光不由自主地飘向身后的门。与真嗣同住一个公寓，结果并没有想象中那么糟糕。她再次露出了微笑。

When she was done, she went back into the kitchen to see him waiting at the table for her. "You didn't have to wait."  
她忙完后，回到厨房，发现他正坐在桌边等她。"你不用等我的。"

He smiled at her. "I don't mind."  
他朝她微笑道：“我不介意。”

"You won't get better if you're not resting. Come on. Up you go," she said, poking at him.  
"你不好好休息是不会好转的。来吧，起来。" 她说着，轻轻地戳了戳他。

"Alright, alright." Shinji threw the blanket over his shoulder. He walked next to Asuka towards their rooms.  
"好吧，好吧。" 真嗣将毯子搭在肩上，与明日香一同走向他们的房间。

"Hey Asuka?" he asked. "嘿，明日香？" 他问道。

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"How come you were so worried about me walking out of the apartment?"  
你怎么会那么担心我走出公寓呢？

She shook her head. "Isn't it obvious? You're sick, and I want you to get better."  
她摇了摇头。“这不明显吗？你生病了，我希望你好起来。”

"Sorry again for worrying you," he said.  
“再次为让你担心而道歉，”他说道。

"At least you were okay. You're supposed to be getting better, aren't you?"  
至少你没事。你应该在好转，对吧？

"You're right." 你说得对。

"Idiot," Asuka said, elbowing him lightly on his side. "You're lucky to have me."  
"傻瓜，"明日香说着，轻轻用胳膊肘顶了顶他的侧腹，"有我你真是走运。"

She heard a light chuckle "I am."  
她听到一声轻笑：“是我。”

When they reached their rooms, She turned to him. "Goodnight, sick-boy. See you tomorrow."  
当他们到达房间时，她转向他：“晚安，病小子。明天见。”

"Goodnight." They looked at each other for a moment, sharing the ambience of the evening. Each of them noticed how close together they were.  
"晚安。" 他们相视片刻，共享着夜晚的氛围。彼此都注意到他们靠得如此之近。

Shinji swallowed down his nerves and inched a little closer. In surprise, Asuka did the same. She decided to throw caution to the wind and go for it. After feeling so close to him over the past few days, why not? She could feel the heat coming off of his face, which served as a reminder.  
真嗣咽下紧张，小心翼翼地靠近了一些。惊讶之下，明日香也做出了同样的举动。她决定不顾一切，放手一搏。经过这几天与他如此亲近，为何不呢？她能感受到他脸上的热度，这成了一个提醒。

Asuka grabbed the sides of his head and brought it downward, kissing him on the forehead. "I don't want to get sick. Sorry."  
明日香抓住他的头两侧，将其向下拉，亲吻了他的额头。“我不想生病。对不起。”

Shinji fumbled with his words for a moment before speaking. "I, uh, Asuka?"  
真嗣结巴了一会儿才开口：“我，呃，明日香？”

"Yeah?" “嗯？”

"Thank you." His arms wrapped around her, resting on her upper back. His hands felt warm.  
"谢谢你。" 他的双臂环绕着她，轻轻搭在她的后背上。他的手感觉温暖。

Asuka stroked his temple with her thumb. "Goodnight, Shinji." She leaned forward and bumped his forehead, before backing away and retreating to her room.  
明日香用拇指轻抚着他的太阳穴，“晚安，真嗣。”她倾身向前，轻触他的额头，随后退开，回到自己的房间。

Shinji remained stunned for a moment. What transpired felt like a dream. He could barely register it as he moved to his futon. He laid down and stared at the ceiling. As he replayed the event in his mind, he couldn't help the grin on his face.  
真嗣愣了一会儿，发生的一切仿佛梦境。他几乎无法相信，便走向自己的蒲团。躺下后，他凝视着天花板。脑海中回放着那件事，他忍不住露出了笑容。

He couldn't wait to see Asuka in the morning.  
他迫不及待想在早晨见到明日香。

---

Asuka closed her door and rushed to her bed. She couldn't fathom what possessed her to do what she did. Nevertheless, it filled her with excitement.  
明日香关上门，急忙跑到床边。她无法理解是什么驱使她做出那样的举动，但这份冲动却让她兴奋不已。

She smiled at the thought of seeing Shinji the next morning.  
想到第二天早上能见到真嗣，她不禁微笑起来。
