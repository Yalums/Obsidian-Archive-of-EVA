Ayanami Rei had a secret.  
绫波零有一个秘密。  
  
Of that much, Sohryu Asuka Langley was sure. She watched every day as the blue-haired girl waited for everyone else to leave class before slipping out and heading for some unknown location. She knew that no one else was aware of the secret - how could they be? Ayanami had been so careful to portray herself as the quiet, unshakable PERFECT little girl.  
对此，惣流·明日香·兰格雷确信无疑。她每天都会观察那个蓝发女孩，等待其他人离开教室后，悄悄溜出去前往某个未知地点。她知道没有人察觉到这个秘密——他们怎么可能知道呢？绫波一直小心翼翼地将自己塑造成那个安静、坚定、完美无瑕的小女孩。  
  
But she had made one mistake: she had looked around.  
但她犯了一个错误：她环顾了四周。  
  
Not the greatest of betrayals, all things considered, but when Asuka had been forced to stay late at school one day, and had noticed the other pilot take a surreptitious look around the then-empty classroom before silently taking her leave, Asuka had known she had something to hide. And she intended to find out what.  
考虑到所有情况，这并不是最严重的背叛，但当明日香某天被迫在学校待到很晚，注意到另一位驾驶员在空无一人的教室里偷偷环顾四周，然后悄然离开时，明日香便知道她有什么要隐藏的东西。而她打算揭开这个秘密。  
  
She did not confront the other girl, though - oh no! That little doll would only give her an impassive stare and whisper that she did not know what the other girl was talking about. No, Asuka waited. She waited for two weeks, staying later and later at school under the guise of 'being interested in the drama club's activities' so as not to arouse suspicion.  
她并没有直接面对那个女孩——哦不！那个小洋娃娃只会给她一个冷漠的眼神，低声说她不知道对方在说什么。不，明日香在等待。她等了两个星期，借口“对戏剧社的活动感兴趣”而越来越晚离开学校，以免引起怀疑。  
  
On a scale of 1 to 10, she was only successful at about an 8. Her roommate, and fellow pilot, Ikari Shinji had asked her one day if everything was ok. She had managed to maintain her calm, informing the boy quite levelly that, though he was CURRENTLY rated higher than she for sync-ratios, she most assuredly did not need his pity or condescension.  
如果成功度从 1 到 10 来衡量，她大约只做到了 8 分。她的室友，也是她的同僚驾驶员，碇真嗣有一天问她一切是否还好。她设法保持冷静，相当平静地告诉那个男孩，尽管他目前同步率评级比她高，但她绝对不需要他的怜悯或居高临下的态度。  
  
When the brown-haired boy had stammered that he wasn't trying to be either pitying or condescending, she had brushed past him and headed for the auditorium, as if wasting any further time on idle prattle with the boy would be counterproductive to her timetable.  
当那个棕色头发的男孩结结巴巴地说他并没有试图怜悯或居高临下时，她从他身边擦过，朝礼堂走去，仿佛再浪费时间与那个男孩闲聊会对她的时间表产生反效果。  
  
She had not been bothered by Shinji any further, and apparently their guardian, Katsuragi Misato, had not even noticed her staying later than usual, since she never said one word about it - and that was just fine by Asuka. The fewer people noticed, the fewer people could inadvertently tip the First Child off.  
她再也没有被真嗣打扰过，而他们的监护人葛城美里似乎也完全没有注意到她比平时晚归，因为她对此只字未提——这对明日香来说再好不过了。注意到的人越少，就越少有人会无意中向第一适格者透露风声。  
  
It was a Friday when she decided that she had waited long enough.  
某个周五，她决定已经等得够久了。  
  
She came out of the auditorium as loudly as she could, joking with the idiots who thought she was actually interested in the stupid little production they were putting on and carrying her books under one arm, ensuring that no one would think she was there for any other reason.  
她尽可能大声地走出礼堂，与那些愚蠢到以为她真的对那场无聊的小演出感兴趣的白痴们开着玩笑，一只胳膊夹着书，确保没有人会认为她出现在那里有其他原因。  
  
She spied Ayanami making her way unconcernedly towards the exit, and she immediately stopped talking to the drama losers. Ignoring their looks of shock, she shoved her books into one of the boy's arms, mumbling that she had something she had to take care of, and took off down the hallway.  
她注意到绫波毫不在意地朝出口走去，立刻停止了与那些戏剧社失败者的交谈。无视他们震惊的表情，她将书塞进其中一个男孩的怀里，咕哝着说她有事要处理，然后沿着走廊飞奔而去。  
  
It was almost the end of the entire affair right then and there.  
那时，整件事几乎就要在那儿画上句号了。  
  
As she approached the corner, she came skidding to a halt, recalling how careful Ayanami had been up to that point. Slowly, she pressed herself back up against the row of lockers on the wall and peeked around the corner, making sure to stay in the shadow cast by the setting sun.  
当她接近拐角时，突然停了下来，回想起绫波之前是多么小心。她慢慢地将自己贴回墙边的储物柜，从角落里偷偷望去，确保自己藏在落日投下的阴影中。  
  
Her efforts at stealth were well rewarded.  
她的潜行努力得到了丰厚的回报。  
  
Standing with her hand on the door, looking back into the school, Ayanami appeared as nothing so much as a criminal on the verge of committing her crime. Her body was tenser than Asuka had ever seen, and her ruby-red eyes scanned the hallway where Asuka was standing with great care, obviously trying to pick up any sign of a follower. Her lips, Asuka noted, were pulled down ever so slightly, as if she was too nervous to remain straight faced and frowning outright would be too much of a giveaway.  
手扶着门，回头望向学校，绫波零此刻看起来就像一个即将犯下罪行的罪犯。她的身体比明日香见过的任何时候都要紧绷，那双红宝石般的眼睛仔细地扫视着明日香所在的走廊，显然是在试图察觉任何跟踪的迹象。明日香注意到，她的嘴唇微微下垂，仿佛紧张得无法保持面无表情，而直接皱眉又太过显眼。  
  
Asuka held her breath. 明日香屏住了呼吸。  
  
After thirty seconds, Ayanami blinked, seeming to decide that no one was following her, and let out a barely audible sigh. Her face once more became the impassive mask the redhead pursuing her was used to, and she stepped out the door without another look.  
三十秒后，绫波眨了眨眼，似乎确定没人跟踪她，然后发出一声几乎听不见的叹息。她的脸再次变成了红发追逐者所熟悉的那副无动于衷的面具，她一步跨出门外，没有再回头看一眼。  
  
Asuka smiled to herself, waiting to the count of 10 before stepping out of the shadows and resuming her chase. The girl was careful, Asuka would give her that, but she was almost TOO careful. She was looking for a casual passerby, an idle, unconcerned wanderer that might discover her secret by accident. She never suspected that a combat-trained, determined college graduate was on her trail.  
明日香暗自微笑，数到十后才从阴影中走出，继续她的追逐。这个女孩很谨慎，明日香得承认这一点，但她几乎过于谨慎了。她在寻找一个普通的过路人，一个闲散、不关心的流浪者，可能会无意中发现她的秘密。她从未怀疑过一个受过战斗训练、决心坚定的大学毕业生正在跟踪她。  
  
And Asuka intended to keep it that way.  
而明日香打算保持这样。  
  
Out on the street, Ayanami was already two blocks ahead of Asuka, moving with an even stride through the thronging masses of late-afternoon commuters, never once looking behind her to see if she was being followed. Asuka smiled as she started walking, knowing that her quarry would now lead her to her secret. She had become complacent, unaware - careless. And for that, she would pay the price.  
在街上，绫波已经领先明日香两个街区，她步伐均匀地穿过傍晚下班高峰的人群，从未回头看是否有人跟随。明日香微笑着开始行走，知道她的目标现在会带她去揭开秘密。她变得自满，未察觉——粗心大意。为此，她将付出代价。  
  
For over six miles, the redhead pursued the blue-haired girl, ducking behind poles, mailboxes, or even other pedestrians any time it looked like her target was looking her way. Six miles. And for every step, Asuka's curiosity grew. Not a foot towards NERV headquarters, not an inch towards her rundown little apartment, the First Child walked straight for the edge of town.  
红发女孩追逐着蓝发女孩，超过六英里，每当目标似乎要回头时，她就躲在电线杆、邮箱甚至其他行人后面。六英里。每走一步，明日香的好奇心都在增长。没有一步朝 NERV 总部去，没有一寸朝她破旧的小公寓去，第一适格者径直走向城镇的边缘。  
  
Truly, Asuka decided, this most be a big secret - a HUGE secret!  
确实，明日香断定，这一定是个大秘密——一个巨大的秘密！  
  
She smiled as she imagined the look of dismay on the other girl's face when she confronted her.  
她微笑着想象着另一个女孩面对她时的沮丧表情。  
  
As they neared a large park on the outskirts of town, Ayanami's gait took on an uncharacteristic bounce that gave the Second Child pause. Was the blue-haired Wondergirl going to see a boy, perhaps?? As unlikely as it seemed, the pieces clicked together quite nicely. The furtive glances, the constant double-checking for followers, the - wait! Could it be?  
当他们接近镇郊的一个大公园时，绫波的步伐带上了不寻常的轻快，这让第二适格者不禁停顿。难道这位蓝发奇迹女孩要去见一个男孩？尽管看似不太可能，但这些线索却意外地吻合。那些偷偷摸摸的眼神，不断回头确认是否有人跟踪，等等！难道真的是这样？  
  
Asuka's eyes widened as the First Child entered the park. Could it be Shinji that she was going to meet? It was insane, but oh so plausible! Why else would he take note when she began staying late at school? He was worried she would find out, that's why! But Shinji? It almost seemed too farfetched.  
当第一适格者走进公园时，明日香瞪大了眼睛。难道她要去见的是真嗣？这太疯狂了，但又如此合理！不然他为什么会在她开始在学校待到很晚时特别留意？他担心她会发现，这就是原因！但真嗣？这似乎太过牵强了。  
  
Shaking her head to clear it, Asuka hurried into the park after Ayanami, oddly thrilled at the idea of finding the other two Children locked in a passionate embrace. How perfect would that be? To be able to put BOTH of them in their place! She knew they talked about her when she wasn't around, she wasn't stupid. It would even be worth being ranked second on the sync-tests to be able to shut both Ikari and Wondergirl up with a small, knowing smile.  
摇摇头清醒一下，明日香急忙跟着绫波进入公园，对找到另外两个孩子陷入激情拥抱的想法感到莫名兴奋。那该有多完美？能够同时让他们俩闭嘴！她知道他们背地里议论她，她并不傻。哪怕在同步测试中排名第二也值得，只要能用一个会心的小微笑让他们俩都闭嘴。  
  
The park was quiet. Of course, what better place for a secret rendezvous? Isolated from the rest of the world, away from prying eyes - the perfect place for Ayanami and Ikari to meet!  
公园里很安静。当然，还有什么比这里更适合秘密幽会的地方呢？远离世界其他角落，避开窥探的目光——正是绫波和真嗣约会的完美场所！  
  
Or maybe Ayanami and Suzuhara? Or Aida? Asuka shook her head harder as the possibilities doubled and tripled. She couldn't explain why, but the idea of it being Touji or Kensuke seemed better somehow.  
或许是绫波和铃原？或者是相田？明日香更加用力地摇了摇头，随着可能性的倍增，她无法解释为什么，但觉得如果是铃原或相田似乎更好一些。  
  
She did not pause to think on why, however, as she spotted Ayanami coming to a halt by the side of a small, meandering stream. She ducked down into the underbrush as the blue-haired girl suddenly took a sharp look around, her eyes narrowing slightly as she surveyed the terrain.  
她没有停下来思考为什么，因为当她看到绫波停下来，站在一条蜿蜒的小溪旁时。她迅速蹲下，躲进了灌木丛中，只见蓝发女孩突然警惕地环顾四周，眼神微微眯起，仔细打量着周围的环境。  
  
Asuka tried to make herself as small as possible, willing her body to remain absolutely motionless until the First Child finally looked away once more, her eyes seeming to rest on the stream at her feet.  
明日香尽量让自己变得越小越好，她努力控制身体保持绝对静止，直到第一适格者再次移开视线，目光似乎停留在她脚下的溪流上。  
  
Now, the redhead thought, pleased with her stealth, now we'll see who your secret boyfriend is!  
现在，红发女孩心想，对自己的隐秘行动感到满意，现在我们就能揭晓你的秘密男友是谁了！  
  
After five minutes of waiting, Asuka began to grow antsy. Maybe the First had been stood up? While it would be fitting to have that little doll know the embarrassment of waiting forever for a date that would never show up, it was vexing. Asuka wanted to know WHO, dammit! She wanted to see with her own eyes who would be stupid enough to go out with the frost queen.  
等待了五分钟后，明日香开始感到焦躁。也许第一适格者被放了鸽子？虽然让那个小玩偶体验一下永远等待一个永远不会出现的约会的尴尬是挺合适的，但这让人很恼火。明日香想知道是谁，该死的！她想亲眼看看，谁会蠢到和冰霜女王约会。  
  
Her confusion grew as Ayanami took another quick look around, then sat down on the shore of the stream and began carefully removing her shoes.  
她的困惑加深了，因为绫波零又迅速环顾四周，然后在溪岸边坐下，开始小心翼翼地脱掉鞋子。  
  
Rising slowly to her feet to get a better look, the redhead frowned. What WAS the pale girl doing? She had taken her shoes off, setting them to the side with utmost care, and was methodically taking her socks off.  
红发女孩慢慢站起身来，想看得更清楚些，她皱起了眉头。那个苍白的女孩在做什么？她已经脱掉了鞋子，极其小心地将它们放在一旁，并且正在有条不紊地脱掉袜子。  
  
When the blue-haired girl was barefoot, she craned her head around once more, her eyes studying the underbrush all around as if searching for a spy. Asuka froze as red eyes passed over her hiding place, never once slowing as they completed their circuit.  
当蓝发女孩赤脚时，她再次扭头环顾四周，眼睛仔细打量着周围的灌木丛，仿佛在寻找一个间谍。明日香僵住了，红眼睛掠过她的藏身之处，始终没有放慢速度，完成了它们的巡视。  
  
Apparently satisfied that she was alone, Ayanami closed her eyes - and slipped her feet into the stream.  
显然，绫波确认了自己是独自一人后，闭上了眼睛——并将脚滑入了溪流中。  
  
Asuka blinked as the First Child let out a soft, content sigh. What was this? Some kind of signal that the coast was clear and her boyfriend could approach her? No, nothing like that. She was still alone two minutes later. What, then? What was she doing? Another two minutes of silent observation passed before the truth dawned in Asuka's mind.  
明日香眨了眨眼，看到第一适格者发出一声轻柔、满足的叹息。这是什么？某种表示安全无虞，男友可以接近她的信号吗？不，并非如此。两分钟后，她仍然独自一人。那么，她在做什么呢？又过了两分钟的静默观察，真相才在明日香心中明朗起来。  
  
This WAS her secret. 这曾是她的秘密。  
  
Asuka's hand covered her mouth as the truth of it hit home, almost causing her to gasp as feelings of shame and pity - so very foreign to her - filled her. There sat the First Child, dangling her feet in a clear, babbling brook. Nothing so unusual to the average person, but to Asuka... to Asuka it was clear as crystal.  
当真相击中内心，明日香的手捂住了嘴，几乎让她倒吸一口气，羞愧和怜悯之情——对她来说如此陌生——充满了她。那里坐着第一适格者，悬着脚在清澈潺潺的小溪中。对普通人来说没什么不寻常的，但对明日香来说...对明日香来说，这清晰如水晶。  
  
The secret, Rei's secret - was nothing more than the simple pleasure or dipping her feet in a stream.  
秘密，丽的小秘密——不过是把脚浸入溪流中的简单乐趣。  
  
But to Asuka, who had listened to Shinji tell her about how Ayanami felt that her only purpose in life was Eva, it was bigger than the prospect of a boyfriend. The First Child was a doll - nothing more! She only lived to follow orders and fight in her Evangelion. And yet, there she sat, almost smiling as the cool water washed lazily over her feet. There she sat, relishing the feeling of being alone and at peace.  
但对明日香来说，听完真嗣讲述绫波觉得自己活着的唯一目的就是 Eva 的故事后，这比拥有一个男朋友的想法更为重大。第一适格者不过是个玩偶——仅此而已！她只是为了服从命令和驾驶她的 Eva 而活。然而，她就坐在那里，几乎微笑着，任由清凉的水缓缓冲刷着她的双脚。她就坐在那里，享受着独自一人的宁静。  
  
There she sat, blatantly enjoying life.  
她就坐在那里，公然享受着生活。  
  
How like an intruder the Second Child felt. She had been so determined to find out WHAT Rei's secret was that she failed to even consider WHY she had a secret at all. Another thought fell on her, dropping from the ether of her thoughts like a ton of bricks.  
第二适格者感觉自己就像个闯入者。她一直那么坚决地想要弄清楚绫波的秘密究竟是什么，却从未考虑过她为什么会有秘密。另一个念头突然降临在她心头，如同一块巨石从她思绪的虚空中坠落。  
  
She was stealing. 她在偷窃。  
  
There was no other way to describe it. She was taking something from Rei, just by being there. This was possibly the only thing that Rei EVER had that she could call her own, and Asuka was simply taking it - watching her from the shadows like a thief and KNOWING that Rei was more than just a puppet.  
没有其他词能形容这一点。她只是在那里，就从丽那里拿走了某些东西。这可能是丽唯一能称之为自己的东西，而明日香就这样轻易地夺走——像个小偷一样躲在暗处观察她，并且知道丽不仅仅是个傀儡。  
  
It was a harsh reality to be faced with.  
这是一个残酷的现实，不得不面对。  
  
Better to just leave, she decided, flushing faintly with shame. Yes, better to slip away and pretend she never saw this - let the other girl keep this for herself.  
还是离开为妙，她暗自决定，脸上泛起一丝羞愧的红晕。没错，最好悄悄溜走，假装从未目睹这一切——让另一个女孩独自保留这份秘密。  
  
Asuka took a careful step back.  
明日香小心翼翼地后退了一步。  
  
Rei's head came up in a flash as a branch behind her snapped.  
听到身后树枝断裂的声音，绫波丽迅速抬起头来。  
  
Blue and red met in the still calm of the late afternoon, and there was a secret no more.  
蓝色与红色在傍晚的静谧中相遇，秘密已不再隐藏。  
  
Asuka stayed still as Rei's eyes met hers, the red orbs wide with surprise, uncertainty, and a fear so palpable that the redhead almost cried. 'Please,' the blue-haired girl's eyes screamed, 'oh please God don't let this be happening!'  
明日香静止不动，当绫波的目光与她的相遇时，那双红色眼眸因惊讶、不确定和一种几乎让红发女孩哭泣的恐惧而睁大。'请，'蓝发女孩的眼睛在呐喊，'哦，上帝请不要让这一切发生！'  
  
The Second Child swallowed as Ayanami's expression went blank once more, and she was shaken as the look in her eyes went from fear to despair. The redhead flinched as Ayanami turned back to the stream, closing her eyes once more and slowly, deliberately pulling her feet back onto the shore.  
第二适格者咽了咽口水，当绫波的表情再次变得空白时，她被那眼神从恐惧到绝望的变化所震撼。红发女孩因绫波转回溪流，再次闭上眼睛，缓慢而刻意地将双脚收回岸边而畏缩。  
  
Rei waited silently for the other girl to run off and tell her secret. What else could be the outcome? The Second hated her - had hated her since the first time they had met. What better way to hurt her than to reveal what she did when no one was looking?  
丽等待着，静静地，期待另一个女孩跑开并泄露她的秘密。还能有什么别的结局呢？第二名讨厌她——自从他们第一次见面以来就一直讨厌她。还有什么比揭露她在无人注视时所做的事情更能伤害她的呢？  
  
She'd never felt so helpless - or so unhappy. Soon this pleasure would be taken from her, and she would be back to her empty life. She knew she didn't really DESERVE something like this - why would she? Her life was Eva, Eva was her life, what purpose did coming here day after day to feel the gentle caress of water flowing over her unadorned feet serve?  
她从未感到如此无助——或如此不快乐。很快这种快乐就会被夺走，她将回到空虚的生活中。她知道自己并不真正配得上这样的东西——为什么她会配得上呢？她的生活就是 Eva，Eva 就是她的生活，每天来到这里感受清水轻轻拂过她赤裸的双脚，这又有什么意义呢？  
  
None. 没有。  
  
But still, she mused as she waited for the other girl to take flight, it had felt so nice.  
但她依旧沉思着，等待着另一个女孩起飞，那种感觉真是美妙。  
  
The stillness of the glade was broken once more as Asuka slowly made her way to the other girl's side. In silence, she sat down and began removing her shoes.  
当明日香缓缓走向另一个女孩身边时，林间空地的宁静再次被打破。她默默地坐下，开始脱掉鞋子。  
  
Rei blinked, then stared as the Second Child sat on the grass next to her, removing her shoes and socks, and slipped her feet into the stream.  
绫波愣了一下，然后看着第二适格者坐在她旁边的草地上，脱掉鞋袜，将脚滑入溪流中。  
  
She looked at Asuka uncertainly as the girl leaned back, bracing herself on her hands, and looked up at the darkening sky. When the redhead made no move to leave, or speak, Rei tentatively slid her feet back into the water. They stayed that way for over ten minutes, simply watching the water tumble past and listening to the cicadas chirping.  
她不确定地看着明日香，那女孩向后靠去，双手撑地，抬头望向渐渐暗下来的天空。当红发女孩没有离开或说话的迹象时，绫波小心翼翼地将脚滑回水中。她们就这样停留了十多分钟，只是静静地看着水流翻滚，听着蝉鸣声。  
  
Finally, Rei reclaimed her feet, drying them as best she could on the grass and slowly putting her socks and shoes back on. Then she stood, looking out at the stream as the other girl remained motionless. Asuka nodded as the blue-haired girl glanced questioningly down at her, answering the silent question in her eyes, and though neither of them ever spoke a word, there was understanding.  
最终，绫波收回双脚，尽可能地在草地上擦干，然后慢慢地穿上袜子和鞋子。她站起身来，望向溪流，而另一名女孩依旧一动不动。明日香点头回应绫波投来的询问目光，尽管她们未发一言，却心领神会。  
  
Before she could stop herself, Rei reached out and touched Asuka's shoulder, giving it a quick squeeze before turning and heading off towards the gate to the park, never once looking back.  
在绫波能阻止自己之前，她伸出手触碰了明日香的肩膀，快速地捏了一下，然后转身朝公园的大门走去，一次也没有回头。  
  
As she was left alone, Asuka let out a deep sigh. Rei's secret was safe with her, yes, it definitely was. She would not be the one to take something so precious from the other girl - no matter what she thought of her. She turned her head slightly, considering the shoulder Rei had touched, and smiled.  
独自一人时，明日香深深地叹了口气。丽的小秘密在她这里很安全，是的，绝对安全。她不会从那个女孩那里夺走如此珍贵的东西——无论她对她有什么看法。她微微转头，思索着丽曾触碰过的肩膀，微笑了。  
  
'Thank you,' the touch had whispered louder than the loudest scream,  
“谢谢你，”那个触碰比最响亮的尖叫还要响亮地低语，  
  
'Thank you...' “谢谢你...”

Notes - this story was written for Ryoma's WAFF fiction contest. And though it didn't do as well as I had hoped, I think it was a good story. WAFF doesn't always have to be romantic.

[emeraldiris](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/258138/emeraldiris): Sooo cute! I luv this fic. It's almost portrays the meaning of a true friend. I luved it! Great job.  
太可爱了！我爱这篇文。它几乎描绘了真正友谊的意义。我超喜欢！干得漂亮。

Usiel: Self-contained, precise, fashioned with obvious care and consistently supportive of its theme. I really enjoyed "Rei's Secret"; thanks also for your reminder that romance isn't the sole source of warmth and fuzz.  
自成一体，精确细致，显然经过精心雕琢，始终紧扣主题。我非常喜欢《丽的小秘密》；同时感谢你提醒我，浪漫并非温暖与柔情的唯一来源。

[TrentNight](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/258790/TrentNight): a nice little story but it is not a WAFF at all so i do not see how it could have entered a WAFF contest... unless i'm missing the whole point of the story here...  
一个温馨的小故事，但它根本不是什么温馨甜蜜（WAFF）风格的作品，所以我看不出它怎么可能进入一个温馨甜蜜（WAFF）比赛...除非我完全误解了这篇故事的主旨...

[MisatoKaji](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/272196/MisatoKaji): Trent - maybe you ARE missing the point. WAFF stands for Warm And Fuzzy Fealing, and this story was tailored to generate that. WAFF does not always mean 'cute kissing scenes.'  
特伦特——或许你真的没抓住重点。WAFF 代表的是温馨和模糊的感觉，这篇故事正是为了营造这种氛围而创作的。WAFF 并不总是意味着‘可爱的亲吻场景’。
