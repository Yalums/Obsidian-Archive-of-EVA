A week ago (Dec 3rd, 2017) on Sufficient Velocity, this conversation took place:  
一周前（2017 年 12 月 3 日）在 Sufficient Velocity 上，发生了这样一段对话：

.

Alan Kelson: I've always wanted a story where it turned that it would've been better to have never loved than to have loved and lost.  
艾伦·凯尔森：我一直想要一个故事，讲述如果从未爱过比爱过又失去要好得多。

.

Akrasiel23: I can think of an Eva fic that could fulfill that: In his first sortie, Shinji's mind briefly connected to that of his mother's, learning all related to the Eva project and her plans to fight SEELE, having drawn the spots from seeing Rei later, the boy eventually deduced his father's plan as well. It's then, feeling the weight of the sins of his parents, that Shinji Ikari makes a choice, to right the wrongs they have done, and might do, to the world, to prevent SEELE's plans from coming into fruition and to ensure that no one else would have to die in the war to come, and for that, he must avoid that which made his father falter and fall into evil.  
Akrasiel23：我能想到一个《EVA》同人作品可以满足这一点：在首次出击时，真嗣的意识短暂地与母亲的相连，了解了与 EVA 计划及她对抗 SEELE 的计划相关的所有事情。在看到绫波后，他逐渐推断出父亲的计划。就在那时，感受到父母罪孽的重压，真嗣做出了选择，要纠正他们所做及可能对世界造成的错误，阻止 SEELE 的计划实现，并确保在即将到来的战争中没有人再牺牲。为此，他必须避免那些使父亲动摇并堕入邪恶的原因。

He must be alone, never to love nor to receive love, only then, without the ties that blinded his father, can he be able to succeed where he failed and save this broken yet beautiful world.  
他必须孤独，永不爱也不被爱，只有这样，没有那些蒙蔽他父亲的羁绊，他才能在他失败的地方取得成功，拯救这个破碎却美丽的世界。

Man, I think the very concept of the story would make Stryp angry, it's like anti-WAFF.  
天哪，我觉得这个故事的概念本身就会让 Stryp 生气，简直就是反 WAFF（温馨、安慰、美食、家庭）的。

.

Panther2G: While I still prefer WAFF, of course, I can see how this concept could still be done to make a very poignant, bittersweet fic about the sacrifices needed for a greater victory... or a very dark one, especially if it backfires, and things go worse than canon due to Shinji sealing himself off... just like his father. In trying to be unlike him, Shinji becomes identical. He'd end up like Ritsuko when she realized she'd turned into her mother.  
Panther2G：虽然我仍然偏爱 WAFF，当然，我也能理解这个概念如何被用来创作一部非常深刻、苦乐参半的同人作品，讲述为了更大的胜利所需的牺牲……或者是一部非常黑暗的作品，特别是如果事情适得其反，情况比原作更糟，因为真嗣封闭了自己……就像他父亲一样。在试图不像他父亲的过程中，真嗣变得一模一样。他最终会像律子意识到自己变成了母亲那样。

Hm... assuming the more positive one, there's even space for a post-war fic where Shinji finally lets himself relax, now that they've won, and start trying to make it up to all the people he _wanted_ to care about but could not. Asuka and the others could be steep mountains to climb in that quest, since Asuka in particular might have been deeply hurt by the way Shinji more actively shut her down than in canon. But the world has been saved, and there's now all the time in their lives to apologize.  
嗯……假设是更积极的情况，甚至还有空间写一篇战后同人，讲述真嗣终于在胜利后放松自己，开始尝试弥补所有他想关心却无法关心的人。对于这个任务，明日香和其他人可能是难以攀登的高山，尤其是明日香，她可能因为真嗣比原作中更积极地拒绝她而深受伤害。但世界已经被拯救，现在他们有整个生命的时间去道歉。

.

That gave me an idea, and combined with a desire to do a fic for Asuka's birthday on Decmber 4th, led to this.  
这给了我一个灵感，再加上 12 月 4 日想为明日香庆生的愿望，便有了这篇作品。

---

I thought I knew everything. I was also 14. So this means I really knew just enough to be #1) an insufferable jerk, #2) a tormented, overwrought _emo_ jerk, and #3) and hurtful idiot.  
我曾以为自己无所不知。那时我也才 14 岁。所以这意味着我实际上只是足够成为一个#1) 令人难以忍受的混蛋，#2) 一个被折磨得过度敏感的忧郁混蛋，以及#3) 一个伤人的白痴。

And a jerk. Of course.  
当然，还是一个混蛋。

In my defense, I was _trying_ to save the world.  
在我辩护一下，我当时正试图拯救世界。

Everyone knows the public story, of course. The parts that were released after the ICJ Tribunal on Third Impact, the UN Trials, the separate national investigations, etc. I, Shinji Ikari, son of Supreme Commander of NERV Gendo Ikari, was summoned to Tokyo-3 on short notice to pilot Evangelion Unit-01 against what would eventually be admitted was the _Third_ Angel, Sachiel. And somehow I won a spectacular victory.  
当然，大家都知道公开的版本。那些在第三次冲击国际法院仲裁庭、联合国审判、各国独立调查等之后公布的部分。我，碇真嗣，NERV 最高指挥官碇源堂之子，被紧急召至第三新东京市，驾驶 EVA 初号机对抗最终被承认是第三使徒的萨基尔。不知怎么地，我取得了惊人的胜利。

What the public official version mostly leaves out was that was mostly my mother doing the smashing and winning. Sure, I turned out to have an annoying amount of talent for a job I mostly hated, but that first battle was 90% mother. I mostly just held on and tried not to throw up.  
官方公开版本大多遗漏的是，那场胜利主要归功于我的母亲。没错，我发现自己对这份我大多时候都讨厌的工作有着令人恼火的才华，但那第一场战斗，90%是母亲的功劳。我大部分时间只是紧紧抓住，努力不让自己吐出来。

It wasn't just the physical side, being thrown around in a wildly charging Evangelion. It was the other side, the part that I haven't really told anyone outside the Tribunals about until now. When mother and I were deeply synched like that, the bond between us wide open in the Eva, I could hear her, communicate with her.  
不仅仅是身体上的，被一台疯狂冲锋的 EVA 抛来抛去。还有另一面，那部分我至今未曾向审判庭之外的任何人透露过。当母亲和我如此深度同步时，在 EVA 中我们之间的联系完全敞开，我能听到她，与她交流。

And she told me everything. SEELE, their plans, Second Impact, Instrumentality, everything.  
她告诉我一切。SEELE，他们的计划，第二次冲击，人类补完计划，所有的一切。

I have to admit, I more or less freaked the Hell out. It wasn't just shock from the end of the battle that made me pass out at the end, and wake up later in the hospital. It was learning my whole family was insane and bent on ending the world and humanity as I knew it in the name of trying to be gods.  
我得承认，我或多或少吓得魂飞魄散。战斗结束时的昏厥并不仅仅是因为震惊，醒来后发现自己躺在医院里。而是得知我的整个家族都疯了，一心想要以试图成为神的名义终结我所知道的世界和人类。

Hell of a thing to drop on a 14 year old boy who hadn't precisely had a great childhood to begin with.  
这对一个原本童年就不太美好的 14 岁男孩来说，简直是地狱般的打击。

So... I kind of went a little nuts. In retrospect, and a pile of therapy, it's easy to say 'Holy shit, that was not healthy and a miracle it didn't leave everyone dead or insane!', but again, I was 14, traumatized, and had a shitty upbringing. So in the face of learning all this, and accepting mother's charge that I had to stop this, I... shut down, sort of.  
所以...我有点失控了。现在回想起来，再加上一堆心理治疗，很容易说‘我靠，那真是不健康，没让所有人都死掉或疯掉简直是奇迹！’，但再次强调，我当时 14 岁，受到创伤，成长环境也很糟糕。所以在面对这一切，接受母亲的嘱托我必须阻止这一切时，我...有点崩溃了。

I wanted to tell everyone, someone, some adult. Misato, or someone. Not me, not 14 year old Shinji Ikari, who was by no measure fit to save the world from a conspiracy that would make the Elders of Zion look like a bad parody. But mother warned me that SEELE would not hesitate a bit to kill anyone who showed signs of knowing too much, so I couldn't.  
我想告诉所有人，某个成年人。美里，或者其他人。不是我，不是 14 岁的碇真嗣，他根本不适合去拯救世界，面对一个比锡安长老会纪要还离谱的阴谋。但母亲警告我，SEELE 绝不会犹豫去杀掉任何表现出知道太多迹象的人，所以我不能说。

So I shut out everything that wasn't... mission critical. Mother and I figured out pretty fast that father had... not taken her loss well, and was on his own plan. So, in order not to end up like him, I shut out the idea of getting attached. To anyone. I would be the rock and the island that humanity needed to save the world. I could have a breakdown later.  
所以我屏蔽了所有非任务必需的东西。母亲和我很快就发现父亲...没能很好地接受她的离去，而是按自己的计划行事。因此，为了避免变得像他一样，我摒弃了与人建立情感联系的想法。对任何人都是如此。我将成为人类拯救世界所需的磐石和孤岛。我可以稍后再崩溃。

And I did. Oh God, did I.  
而我确实崩溃了。哦，天哪，我真的崩溃了。

And so did Asuka, Touji, Misato...  
明日香、冬二、美里...他们也一样。

I am truly sorry, all of you. You know exactly how much, since despite my efforts, SEELE and my father still managed to trigger Instrumentality after... after Kaworu. And so you all got to see inside me, and see my intentions, just as I saw inside you. But you all took that knowledge, and stood with me as we faced down my father, and shut Instrumentality down before it went too far, and we saved the world anyhow.  
我真的很抱歉，你们所有人。你们清楚这有多严重，尽管我尽了全力，SEELE 和我父亲还是在...在渚薰之后，依然启动了人类补完计划。于是你们都看到了我的内心，了解我的意图，正如我窥见了你们的心。但你们接受了这些，与我并肩站在一起，面对我的父亲，阻止了人类补完计划，使其没有走得太远，我们终究拯救了世界。

I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough alone.  
对不起，我一个人还不够强大。

I'm sorry to Asuka most of all. Seeing into her heart, seeing how she'd been trying to reach out to me in her way, and how deeply I hurt her by shutting her out cold in my quest to be... unattached... I have yet to forgive myself for that. Even saving the world was almost too much, when it cut her like that.  
我最对不起的是明日香。窥见她的内心，看到她以自己的方式试图接近我，以及我在追求...无牵无挂...的过程中，冷漠地将她拒之门外，给她带来的深深伤害，我至今未能原谅自己。即使拯救了世界，当这一切如利刃般刺伤她时，也几乎让我难以承受。

I have every right to do that with my own heart, my own soul. But I never asked permission for hers. It was not mine to spend like that, and I don't know if I ever _can_ forgive myself for how I hurt her. I knew some of it at the time, too. Hard to miss the muffled weeping coming from her room some nights. I wouldn't let myself... do anything. But what carried me through was the promise I kept making to myself was that once we had beaten SEELE, I'd make up for it, even if it took the rest of my life.  
我完全有权用自己的心、自己的灵魂去做那件事。但我从未征求过她的同意。那不是我可以随意挥霍的，我不知道自己是否能原谅自己给她带来的伤害。当时我也意识到了一些。那些夜晚，她的房间里传来的压抑哭泣声很难忽视。我没有让自己……做任何事。但支撑我走下去的是我不断对自己许下的承诺，一旦我们打败了 SEELE，我会弥补这一切，哪怕需要余生。

Some nights that promise was all that let me sleep.  
有些夜晚，这个承诺是我唯一能让我入睡的东西。

So there we were, SEELE smashed, every member of the conspiracy that we managed to capture before they could cheat the hangman in jail forever, the disruption of Instrumentality settled, everything right with the world. Great, right? They gave us therapists, stipends, and public congratulations, and then stuffed Asuka, Misato, and myself right back in that apartment, to be left alone by the reformed UN, the Japanese Government, and the media. At our own request, yes.  
于是，SEELE 被击溃，所有在我们抓获之前未能逃脱的阴谋成员都被永久监禁，人类补完计划的干扰得以平息，世界一切安好。很棒，对吧？他们给了我们治疗师、津贴和公开的祝贺，然后把明日香、美里和我塞回了那个公寓，让我们远离改革后的联合国、日本政府和媒体。这是我们自己的要求，是的。

And no, I have no idea how Tokyo-3 was put back as it was, empty Geofront and all. Blame it on Rei Ayanami.  
而且不，我完全不知道东京-3 是如何恢复原样的，包括空无一物的地底都市。这得怪绫波零。

You might have thought 'Oh, great! We're still living together, all bills taken care of, perfect opportunity to make things up to Asuka and Misato!' Rei too, if she'd ever come back from Instrumentality.  
你可能会想：‘哦，太好了！我们还能住在一起，所有账单都解决了，正是弥补对明日香和美里亏欠的完美机会！’如果绫波从人类补完计划中回来的话，她也会这么想。

You'd have been wrong.  
你可就错了。

Turns out, while Asuka got a good look inside my heart during all that, and saw _why_ I'd shut her out, she also saw that I was far more aware of her attraction and flirting with me than I let on at the time, _and_ my own awareness that I was hurting her by rejection. Which she... took badly.  
事实证明，在那段时间里，虽然明日香深入了解了我的心，看到了我为何将她拒之门外，但她同时也发现，我其实远比当时表现出来的更清楚她对我的吸引和挑逗，以及我意识到自己的拒绝在伤害她。而她……对此反应很糟糕。

Things on that front came to a head December 4th, 2016. Yes, her 15th birthday. Yes, it was my fault. Of course. I had made up a pretty, authentic-calligraphy-and-all letter apologizing to her and promising to never again hurt her, to always be there when she wanted or needed me. I'd explained everything to her already, over the months we'd all been living together, but it felt proper to have it all written down and in a nice formal form to give her as a present.  
这方面的事情在 2016 年 12 月 4 日达到了顶点。没错，那是她的 15 岁生日。是的，这都是我的错。当然。我写了一封漂亮的、用真正书法书写的信向她道歉，并承诺再也不会伤害她，无论何时她需要或想要我，我都会在那里。我已经向她解释了所有事情，在我们共同生活的这几个月里，但我觉得把这些都写下来，并以正式的形式作为礼物送给她，才是恰当的。

I'm not a _complete_ idiot. It was hardly the only present I'd gotten her. Plus the full course meal I'd spent the day cooking up.  
我并不是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。这几乎不是我送给她的唯一礼物。还有我花了一整天时间准备的全套大餐。

Ok, fine, I _was_ a complete idiot. Yes, I was doing all this out of pathetic hope that I wouldn't somehow permanently drive away the gorgeous, vibrant, and utterly fascinating girl I'd fallen for.  
好吧，没错，我是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。是的，我做这一切都是出于可悲的希望，希望不会以某种方式永远赶走那个美丽、充满活力且极其迷人的女孩，我已对她倾心。

Yes, I loved her. Yes, through the war itself and my stupid promise to put saving the world above everything else. That promise was a lot easier to make before I met her. It was hard enough when I met Rei. I sort of loved her too. But I was 14 and afraid and desperate about SEELE and my father's plans, so it was easier to shut all that out and tell myself it was necessary to save the world.  
是的，我爱她。是的，即便在战争期间，以及我那愚蠢的承诺，要把拯救世界置于一切之上。在遇见她之前，这个承诺容易得多。遇见丽时已经够难了。我也有些爱她。但我当时 14 岁，害怕，对 SEELE 和我父亲的计划感到绝望，所以更容易把这些都抛诸脑后，告诉自己为了拯救世界这是必要的。

I did mention I was an idiot.  
我确实说过我是个傻瓜。

I mentioned my promise to make things up after the war, and this felt like a way to both apologize and assure her I meant everything I'd told her over the months since Instrumentality. But of course, I hadn't really let myself face thinking about her pain over events, or the timing. So when I handed Asuka that envelope with my letter at the end of her birthday dinner, I probably should have expected what happened. Asuka read the letter, her face going blank, and then gave me a look that I'm surprised didn't burn the shirt off my chest and the skin off my face. It felt like it was Ramiel all over again.  
我提到了战后弥补一切的承诺，这感觉像是一种既能道歉又能向她保证我自使徒事件以来的几个月里所说的一切都是真心的方式。但当然，我并没有真正让自己面对她因这些事件所受的痛苦，或是时间安排的问题。所以当我把装有我信件的信封在她的生日晚餐结束时递给明日香时，我可能应该预料到会发生什么。明日香读了信，脸上变得毫无表情，然后给了我一个眼神，我惊讶于它竟然没有烧掉我的衬衫和脸上的皮肤。感觉就像又是雷米尔一样。

"You... you _fucking_ _**ass**_!" she screamed.  
“你……你这个混蛋！”她尖叫道。

I blinked. I had no idea.  
我眨了眨眼。我完全不知道。

"You.. you give me this, this... _NOW?!_ You give me this _NOW?!_ Where were you when I was being violated by the 15th?! Where were you when I was alone in this apartment a year ago today?! Where were you when I was lying in that bathtub waiting to DIE?! NOW? Now because it's convenient to you?!" she roared. "Fuck off and _DIE_!"  
"你...你现在给我这个，这个...现在？！你现在给我这个？！当我被第 15 个侵犯时你在哪里？！一年前的今天，我独自在这间公寓时你在哪里？！我在浴缸里躺着等死时你在哪里？！现在？现在只是因为对你方便吗？！"她咆哮道。"滚开去死吧！"

"Asuka, I-"

The wadded up letter hit me in the face. By the time I blinked my eyes open again, she was around the corner and down the hall. I heard her bedroom door slam shut.  
那团皱巴巴的信打在我脸上。等我再次眨眼睁开时，她已经转过拐角，消失在走廊尽头。我听到她的卧室门砰地一声关上了。

We didn't talk for a week.  
我们整整一周没有说话。

And that's the story of how I ruined Asuka Langley Soryu's 14th _and_ 15th birthdays.  
这就是我如何毁掉了惣流·明日香·兰格雷的 14 岁和 15 岁生日。

Author's Note: For background, in this AU neither Rei nor Kaworu returned from Instrumentality, and Shinji shut out everyone pretty hard all the way up to Instrumentality, deeply hurting Asuka and Misato.  
作者注：背景设定中，在这个 AU 里，绫波零和渚薰都没有从人类补完计划中回归，而真嗣一直封闭自己，直到人类补完计划，深深伤害了明日香和美里。

---

Things improved over the next year. They kind of had to, since screaming at me and throwing things was kind of a low bar.  
接下来的那一年，情况有所改善。他们不得不如此，毕竟对我大喊大叫和扔东西已经算是低谷了。

In hindsight, the fact that we were still living together probably should have been a hint. But as I mentioned, I'm an idiot. I lived in a perpetual state of low-grade dread that Asuka would just one day up and move out to her own place, a threat she made not infrequently. In retrospect, I should have given more weight to my own desperate mental self-reassurance that Asuka did view us as family of a sort, and family that she liked a lot more than her father and step-mother, so why would she leave?  
事后想来，我们仍住在一起的事实或许本应是个暗示。但如我所说，我是个傻瓜。我总是处于一种低度的恐惧状态，担心明日香有一天会突然搬出去住，她经常这么威胁。回想起来，我本应更加重视自己内心绝望的自我安慰，即明日香确实将我们视为某种家庭，一个她比亲生父亲和继母更喜欢得多的家庭，那么她为什么要离开呢？

We'd seen each other's hearts. The idea of Asuka leaving terrified me like nothing else. I should have known the same was true for her.  
我们曾窥见过彼此的心灵。明日香离开的想法让我感到前所未有的恐惧。我本该知道，她也是同样的感觉。

It was bad enough to lose Misato.  
失去美里已经够糟糕了。

We should have seen it coming, and I suppose on some level we did. Kaji's resurrection may have been some final gift from Rei, but Misato never questioned it. She and Kaji didn't take long to resume where they'd left off, and it was only a few months after Asuka's 15th birthday that Misato told us she was moving out, to a place with more room for the family she and Kaji intended to start on.  
我们本该预见到这一切，我想在某种程度上我们也确实预见到了。加持的复活或许是绫波最后的馈赠，但美里从未对此产生过疑问。她和加持很快便重燃旧情，而就在明日香 15 岁生日后的几个月，美里告诉我们她要搬出去，去一个有更多空间的地方，为她和加持打算组建的家庭腾出空间。

She was moving herself out so as to disrupt things for us as little as possible, she said. And she'd be close by. Close-ish. Still within Tokyo-3, anyway. Most of the time. Kaji and she were both still in high demand as two of the few people the reformed UN trusted to ferret out any SEELE leftovers, and they traveled a lot. We'd have her phone number, call anytime.  
她说，她搬出去是为了尽可能减少对我们生活的影响。而且她会离我们很近，近得差不多。无论如何，还是在第三新东京市内。大部分时间如此。加持和她作为联合国改组后少数几个值得信赖的人，依然备受追捧，负责追查任何可能残留的 Seele 成员，因此他们经常出差。我们会保留她的电话号码，随时可以联系她。

Ok, yes, it was her running away too. I said we got therapy, not that it fully helped. We were all messes, especially after Instrumentality. The rest of the world got off lightly, forgetting most of it. Asuka, Misato, and I were all right there at the eye of the storm, and got all of it. It's easy to look back now and say 'Misato was a barely-functional alcoholic with toxic coping tactics'. She was still one of the only people in my life who had _ever_ tried to care for me. So I give her a pass.  
好吧，是的，她也逃跑了。我说我们接受了治疗，并不是说它完全有效。我们都是一团糟，尤其是在人类补完计划之后。世界其他地方的人轻松脱身，大多忘记了这一切。明日香、美里和我，我们都处在风暴的中心，承受了所有的痛苦。现在回望过去，说‘美里是个几乎无法正常生活的酗酒者，有着有毒的应对策略’很容易。但她仍然是生活中唯一试图关心我的人之一。所以我原谅了她。

And to be fair, it was partly resentment from both Asuka and I that colored our initial reactions. For me, too much like being dumped at the train station by my father. For Asuka, too much like a validation of her fears that everyone would abandon the 'real her'. We snapped at each other for days. Asuka took over Misato's former room, so I finally got my old one back.  
公平地说，我和明日香最初的反应也部分源于我们的怨恨。对我来说，这太像被父亲丢在火车站的感觉。对明日香来说，这太像是对她恐惧的验证——每个人都会抛弃‘真实的她’。我们为此争吵了几天。明日香占据了美里以前的房间，所以我终于又回到了我的旧房间。

It would be easy to describe us as two broken teenagers too afraid to leave even the meager comfort we had in our little shelter. It would be wrong. We had no real close neighbors. There was still hardly anyone in our building. Misato made sure to screen the Hell out of anyone trying to move in, and kept the cultists, celebrity-chasers, and other nuts away. It was isolation, sure, a little. But it was more privacy than that, and that's what Asuka and I both wanted. We were both still very afraid of other people, really.  
要形容我们为两个破碎的青少年，害怕离开我们那小小避难所中仅有的微薄安慰，这很容易。但这并不准确。我们并没有真正的近邻。大楼里依然人迹罕至。美里对任何试图搬进来的人都进行了彻底的筛选，将那些邪教徒、追星族和其他疯子拒之门外。的确，这是一种隔离，有一点。但更多的是隐私，而这正是我和明日香所渴望的。我们俩都非常害怕其他人，真的。

But per the directive/urging of our therapists, we did venture out of our comfort zone. Shopping. School. A few low-key public events. A few media interviews a year. I nearly cheered when I saw Asuka do her first solo TV interview in 2017. She said she hated it. Because I wasn't there.  
但根据我们的治疗师的指示/催促，我们确实走出了舒适区。购物、上学、参加一些低调的公共活动，每年进行几次媒体采访。当我看到明日香在 2017 年首次独自接受电视采访时，我几乎要欢呼了。她说她讨厌那样。因为我不在场。

Because we did all the rest together. All of it. Even our half-assed attempts at dating.  
因为我们一起做了所有其他的事情。所有的一切。甚至包括我们那半吊子的约会尝试。

Yes, we tried that too. Not each other. Other people. I took Asuka's 'fuck off and die' as a pretty clear instruction to back off, and did. We went to some mixers, tried some blind dates arranged by Hikari and such, things like that. Asuka went on more than I did. She always was better about being able to fake a public persona than I was. But even I had a few. Even some that were more than single dates.  
是的，我们也尝试过那样。不是彼此。是其他人。我把明日香那句‘滚开去死’理解为相当明确的退避指令，于是照做了。我们参加了一些联谊会，尝试了光子安排的相亲之类的活动，诸如此类。明日香比我参加的更多。她在公众面前伪装自己这方面一直比我强。但即便如此，我也经历了几次。甚至有些不止是一次约会。

I'm still glad Asuka was my first kiss. None of the others came close.  
我仍然很高兴明日香是我的初吻。其他人都无法与之相比。

But anyway, she and I still did most things together. It was... less scary. Call it residual guilt from Instrumentality, fear everyone else in the world would see us as to blame, or whatever. She'd give me annoyed looks and sharp comments a lot, but she always demanded I be there.  
但无论如何，她和我仍然一起做了大部分事情。那样...没那么可怕。或许是残留的对人类补完计划的愧疚，害怕世界上其他人会把我们视为罪魁祸首，或者别的什么原因。她经常给我恼怒的眼神和尖锐的评论，但她总是要求我在她身边。

I never let myself _believe_ it was her accepting my promise.  
我从未让自己相信那是她接受了我的承诺。

Her 16th birthday was more social than the last. It wasn't just Misato, I, and her this time. We'd invited friends we'd made over the year, our friends from school, even the pair Asuka still referred to as 'the Stooges'. We even invited some of Asuka's 'ex-boyfriends', or at least the ones who'd rated more than one date with her. She didn't have anyone serious.  
她的 16 岁生日比上次更热闹。这次不只是我和 Misato 还有她。我们邀请了这一年里结识的朋友，学校的同学，甚至包括 Asuka 仍称之为'傻瓜二人组'的那对。我们还邀请了 Asuka 的一些'前男友'，或者至少是那些和她约会过不止一次的人。她并没有真正意义上的男朋友。

She seemed happy. 她看起来很开心。

Then everyone else went home and it was just us again.  
然后其他人各自回家，又只剩下我们俩了。

"Thank you, Shinji." "谢谢你，真嗣。"

"You're welcome, Asuka. Happy birthday." I'd done the full-course meal again, even better. I assumed she was thanking me for that.  
"不客气，明日香。生日快乐。" 我又准备了一顿丰盛的晚餐，甚至比上次更好。我想她是在感谢我这一点。

"I still hate you, you know?"  
"我还是讨厌你，你知道吗？"

I blinked again. "I'm... sorry? Is this... I mean... I'm sorry about last year. I shouldn't hav-"  
我又眨了眨眼。“我……对不起？这是……我是说……我对去年发生的事感到抱歉。我不该……”

"Shut up." She paced back and forth in the living room, picking at the remaining detritus of the party. "You... you are such an idiot. I hate that. You don't get it, do you? I hate you because... this whole year. And yes, your 'promise'. And all the stuff before that. You. I hate you for..." she waved her hands. "All of it. For being... god_dammit_, Shinji! Why weren't you like this before?! _During_ the war, when I needed you?"  
"闭嘴。" 她在客厅里来回踱步，拨弄着派对剩下的残骸。"你……你真是个白痴。我讨厌这样。你不懂，对吧？我讨厌你是因为……这一整年。还有，你的‘承诺’。以及之前发生的所有事情。你。我讨厌你……”她挥舞着手。“所有的一切。因为你……该死的，真嗣！为什么你以前不是这样？！在战争期间，当我需要你的时候？”

"I'm sor-"

"_Don't_ say it." She stopped pacing, staring at me. "You... you've spent this whole year doing what you said. Supporting me. Backing me up. Doing what I want, when I want, as I need. Even when I'm pretty sure you wanted to do something else, or just hide away and do nothing. Why?"  
"别这么说。" 她停下踱步，盯着我。"你……这一整年都在做你说过的事。支持我。支持我。按照我想要的，在我需要的时候做我想做的事。即使我确信你想做别的事，或者只是躲起来什么都不做。为什么？"

"Because I promise-" "因为我承诺过-"

She locked eyes with me. "No. Stop. Don't give me that. I saw your head, Shinji. I know when you're bullshitting. Try again."  
她直视我的眼睛。"不。停下。别用那套糊弄我。我了解你，真嗣。我知道你什么时候在胡扯。再试一次。"

"Because I..." I swallowed and looked away.  
"因为...我..." 我咽了咽口水，移开了视线。

"Say it. I want to hear it out loud."  
"说出来。我想亲耳听到。"

"It's... hard."

"I saw it in Instrumentality! _That's_ why I hate you, Shinji. I saw it, you've said it, it was _in your fucking letter,_ and yet, for the last twelve months, you haven't said it once. Not when I was spending every Friday night out with some guy who wasn't you, not when it was us having dinner alone for the 200th time, not... not once. You said you felt it back then. I _know_ what you felt every time this year. I saw it in your eyes every time I left on a date, every time we said goodnight. You've been a perfect goddamn gentleman, a fucking Nice Guy... I want to know why you haven't said it _even once_ this year.. I _get_ you, Shinji, more than anyone in the world. And I don't get _this_. So explain!" She was breathing hard. I think she was about to... no. She wasn't going to cry. She didn't do that.  
"我在《使徒化》中看到了！这就是我恨你的原因，真嗣。我看到了，你说过，就在你那该死的信里，然而过去十二个月里，你一次都没说过。不是在我每周五晚上和不是你的某个男人出去时，不是在我们单独吃第 200 次晚餐时，不是...一次都没有。你当时说你感受到了。我知道你这一年每次的感受。每次我约会离开时，每次我们互道晚安时，我都在你眼中看到了。你一直是个完美的绅士，一个该死的‘好人’...我想知道为什么你这一年一次都没说过...我理解你，真嗣，比世界上任何人都理解。我不理解这一点。所以解释吧！" 她呼吸急促。我想她快要...不。她不会哭的。她不会那样做。

"Because I don't deserve to. I know how much I hurt you with my brilliant 'no attachments' plan, and you were pretty clear when I gave you the letter last year you... I did all this because I'm keeping my promise, like I said I would. No matter... I don't get a reward. I sold myself to save the world, and I got it, and that's it. I promised to make it up to you, even if it took my life, and I will," I said slowly.  
"因为我配不上。我知道我那绝妙的‘无牵无挂’计划让你受了多大的伤害，去年我给你那封信时，你已经说得很清楚了……我这么做是因为我在遵守我的承诺，就像我说的那样。无论……我不该得到奖赏。我出卖了自己来拯救世界，我做到了，就这样。我承诺过要补偿你，哪怕要付出我的生命，我也一定会做到，"我缓缓地说道。

"GOTT! You are a fucking idiot!" she growled in frustration. "A self-sacrificing _moron_! If you'd been willing to say it _before_, I wouldn't hate you now for _not_ saying it! That's what I hate about you, Shinji! Knowing why you did it, how you felt, how you feel _now_, and you still won't _fucking say it_!" She walked right up to me and grabbed my shirt. "So _SAY IT!_ Why are you doing all this?!"  
"天哪！你真是个彻头彻尾的傻瓜！"她恼怒地咆哮着。"一个自我牺牲的笨蛋！如果你之前愿意说出来，我现在就不会因为你没说而恨你！这就是我讨厌你的地方，真嗣！知道你为什么这么做，你当时的感受，你现在的心情，而你还是他妈的不肯说出来！"她径直走到我面前，抓住我的衬衫。"所以，说出来！你为什么要做这一切？！"

I pinched my eyes shut. "Because I love you and promised I'd never abandon you! There, are you happy no-"  
我闭上眼睛，捏了捏眼角。"因为我爱你，并且承诺过永远不会抛弃你！这样，你满意了吗？"

She slammed her lips to mine.  
她猛地将唇贴上了我的。

I have no idea how long we stood there. I didn't care about anything else. Twenty, thirty minutes? I have no idea, really.  
我不知道我们在那儿站了多久。我不在乎其他任何事。二十分钟，三十分钟？我真的没概念。

Eventually, she broke the kiss. She let go of my shirt, and I fell backwards onto my ass. I smacked my head on the floor, seeing stars.  
最终，她结束了这个吻。她松开了我的衬衫，我向后跌坐在地上。后脑勺撞到地板，眼前直冒金星。

"Such an idiot," she muttered. She turned away and walked into her room, closing the door behind her. But she looked back before she did. And I saw it. It was small, but 100% there.  
“真是个傻瓜。”她低声抱怨着。她转身走进自己的房间，关上了门。但在关门之前，她回头看了一眼。我看到了，虽然微小，但确确实实存在。

I laid there for a while. Brain not found, please reboot. After a long while, I got up, finished cleaning, and went to my room.  
我在那里躺了一会儿。大脑未响应，请重启。过了很久，我起身，打扫完毕，然后回到自己的房间。

And that's how Asuka's 16th birthday ended with me laid out flat on the floor, my head hurting, and Asuka going to bed with a faint smile on her face.  
就这样，明日香 16 岁的生日以我躺在地板上，头痛欲裂，而明日香带着一丝微笑入睡而告终。

Best one yet. 迄今为止最好的一次。

Things got... awkward in 2018.  
2018 年，事情变得...尴尬起来。

I may be an idiot, but Asuka's speech and kiss made it clear...-ish, that she _wanted_ me to... say it. And yes, I had put it rather prominently in my letter. Eventually I more or less understood that Asuka was angry about me locking her out when she (thanks to Instrumentality) had plenty of proof I was as interested in her as she was in me back then, but I buried it. Even for the cause of saving the world.  
我可能是个傻瓜，但明日香的话语和吻清楚地表明...或多或少，她希望我...说出来。是的，我在信中确实写得很明显。最终，我或多或少明白了明日香生气的原因，是因为我在她（得益于人类补完计划）有充分证据证明我当时对她同样感兴趣时，却将她拒之门外，但我选择了埋藏这份情感。即便这是为了拯救世界的缘故。

I tried to tell myself it had been worth it, that it had worked, hadn't it? Asuka's contention was that it would have been better to swing the opposite way, since _she_ was firmly convinced she'd have been better off in the fight knowing I was...um... looking at her, so to speak. She more or less said that in the course of many debates we had on the topic over the next year. It took her a while to say it so bluntly, though.  
我试图告诉自己这一切都是值得的，它奏效了，不是吗？明日香的观点则是，如果她能确信我在...呃...关注她，这么说吧，她在战斗中会表现得更好。在接下来的一年里，我们在多次辩论中或多或少地提到了这一点。不过，她花了些时间才如此直白地说出来。

Yes, even after that kiss, we were both... well, we didn't exactly jump into each other's arms. In fact, for the next several weeks, we were just awkward as Hell around each other. Asuka had made it very clear the ball was in my court, but I had absolutely no idea what to do.  
是的，即便在那次亲吻之后，我们俩...嗯，我们并没有立刻拥抱在一起。事实上，接下来的几周里，我们在彼此面前都尴尬得要命。明日香明确表示球在我这边，但我完全不知道该怎么办。

Don't get me wrong: I _wanted_ to sweep her into my arms, shower kisses and tender whispers all over her, and carry her off to our bed for night after night of gentle-yet-passionate lovemaking.  
别误会：我渴望将她拥入怀中，亲吻她，轻声细语地倾诉爱意，然后带她回到我们的床上，夜复一夜地享受温柔而充满激情的欢爱。

Problem: I am Shinji Ikari, titanic idiot, and she was Asuka Langley Soryu, top-level-expert in self-sabotage and mixed messages. This was going to be like skiing uphill even in the best of circumstances.  
问题在于：我是碇真嗣，一个超级大傻瓜，而她是惣流·明日香·兰格雷，自我破坏和含糊其辞的高手。即便在最好的情况下，这也会像逆坡滑雪一样艰难。

Also, I am about as far from 'smooth Casanova' as humanly possible. If I _tried_ to sweep her into my arms for a kiss, I'd probably trip, knock us both down, and manage to break her nose and my arm on the landing. And then we'd somehow catch fire.  
而且，我离‘风流才子’的形象差了十万八千里。如果我试图将她揽入怀中亲吻，很可能会绊倒，把我们俩都摔倒，还可能摔断她的鼻子和我的胳膊。然后我们不知怎么就会着火。

...double also: I am Shinji Ikari, son of two utterly insane people who were part of a plot to end the world that came within a hair's breadth of succeeding. You cannot _imagine_ the amount of guilt I piled on myself. Yes, my half-assed plan to dedicate myself to nothing but the defeat of SEELE and my father had succeeded, but I almost fucked it all up, and I'm _completely certain_ I could and should have done better. I could have saved more lives, I could have stopped SEELE before they got that far, I could have... I could have...  
……再说一遍：我是碇真嗣，两个彻底疯狂的人的儿子，他们参与了一个差点成功的毁灭世界的阴谋。你无法想象我给自己加了多少罪恶感。是的，我那半吊子的计划——全心全意致力于击败 SEELE 和我父亲——成功了，但我差点搞砸了一切，我完全确信我本可以而且应该做得更好。我本可以拯救更多生命，我本可以在 SEELE 达到那个地步之前阻止他们，我本可以……我本可以……

I could have saved Kaworu.  
我本可以救渚薰。

I know, it's stupid. He was an Angel, the Call would never have left him, and he told me himself that he _had_ to die to end the threat he represented just by existing.  
我知道，这很愚蠢。他是个使徒，召唤绝不会放过他，而且他自己也告诉我，他必须死，仅仅是他存在的威胁就必须被终结。

I don't care. I should have been better. I should have found a way.  
我不在乎。我本应该做得更好。我本应该找到办法。

I shouldn't have had to kill the one person who made me feel _valued_ at that point in my life.  
我本不该被迫去杀那个在当时生活中唯一让我感到被珍视的人。

I shouldn't... he deserved to live. I was the tainted child of madmen out to kill billions. He was cursed by his own birth with what he was. He had no choice, and without choice there cannot be any sin.  
我不应该...他本该活下去。我是个疯子所生的污秽之子，一心要屠杀亿万生灵。他因自己的出身而受诅咒，别无选择，而没有选择就没有罪恶。

Bottom line: The girl I loved had demanded I say it out loud and kissed me, we lived together, and she'd demonstrated she wanted more from me... and the more she did, the less I felt I deserved _any_ of it.  
底线是：我爱的女孩要求我大声说出那句话，并吻了我，我们同居了，她用行动表明她想要更多... 而她越是这样，我越觉得自己不配拥有这一切。

I know it's stupid. It's easy to say that. I said it to _myself_ enough times. But convincing my heart of it was not that simple. I blamed myself for Instrumentality, Kaworu, all the dead on the way... I wasn't lying at all to Asuka when I said I didn't deserve any reward. I wasn't trying for some Nice Guy thing where I'd love her from afar but expect it to count as some kind of credit towards winning her. I loved her without expecting anything back because I was afraid... no, I was _convinced_ I did not deserve her. She deserved better than me.  
我知道这很愚蠢。说起来容易。我自己也对自己说过无数次。但要说服我的心却没那么简单。我为人类补完计划、渚薰，以及一路上的所有死者自责...我对明日香说我不配得到任何回报时，没有半点虚假。我并非在追求某种‘好人’形象，暗中爱她却期待这能算作赢得她的某种积分。我爱她，不期待任何回报，因为我害怕...不，我确信我不配拥有她。她值得比我更好的人。

But oh gods I wanted her.  
但天啊，我渴望她。

So the combination of my wanting her, my wanting to support whatever _she_ wanted, and my monumental guilt complex made for a 'fun' spring of 2018.  
因此，我渴望她、想要支持她的任何愿望，以及我那巨大的罪恶感综合体，共同构成了 2018 年春天‘有趣’的组合。

I didn't know it at the time, and she didn't tell me for years, but Asuka had salvaged my letter from the year before and kept it. She'd read it at times when she felt low. She kept it well hidden: I never found it in years of cleaning our apartment, or even suspected it existed until she mentioned what I'd written in it that time.  
那时我并不知情，多年后她才告诉我，原来明日香从一年前就保留了我的信，并一直珍藏着。在她情绪低落时，会拿出来读一读。她把信藏得很好：我打扫了多年公寓，却从未发现它的踪迹，甚至直到她提及那次我信中所写的内容，我才意识到它的存在。

Again, I should should should have thought about it, about how one of the things that so powerfully attracted me to her was how similar we were in many ways, and how logically, if I was feeling depressed at the idea of any kind of 'reward' for fucking up so badly, or positively terrified at the idea of someone loving me back, she probably was too. But I am blind as Hell in the field, and as I'm sure too many people with depression already know, depression and guilt themselves can suck all power out of even 'knowing' some things.  
再次，我本该想到的，想到我们之间如此强烈的吸引力，很大程度上是因为我们在许多方面如此相似，而逻辑上，如果我对因犯下如此大错而获得某种‘奖励’的想法感到沮丧，或者对有人会爱我回来的念头感到极度恐惧，那么她很可能也有同样的感受。但我在情感领域里盲目如地狱，而且我相信许多抑郁症患者已经知道，抑郁和内疚本身就能将‘知道’某些事情的力量完全抽干。

So we... muddled about. We kept going on 'double dates' and such with others, trying to... I don't know, find someone who could satisfy all the insecurities and needs we had without risking anything we already had. It didn't work too well. Every single date or mixer just underlined it harder: we both wanted _each other_, but were terrified and convinced we didn't merit it.  
于是我们...就这样混日子。我们继续和别人一起‘双约会’之类的，试图...我不知道，找到一个能满足我们所有不安全感与需求的人，同时不破坏我们已经拥有的东西。效果并不太好。每一次约会或联谊都更加凸显了这一点：我们彼此都想要对方，但又害怕且确信自己不配拥有。

What saved us was... well, us. Asuka being Asuka, and me hanging on to one of my few admirable traits. I was a man of my word, and I had made Asuka a promise. Not even Instrumentality or my own fucking issues were going to stop me from keeping my word. And Asuka wasn't going to let me forget it.  
拯救我们的是...嗯，是我们自己。明日香还是那个明日香，而我则坚持着我为数不多的可敬品质之一。我是个守信的人，我曾向明日香许下承诺。即使是人类补完计划或我自己的问题，也无法阻止我履行诺言。而明日香也不会让我忘记这一点。

It's easy now, to look back and realize every time Asuka poked me and reminded me about my promise, and how much an idiot I was for not saying something before Third Impact, she was really asking me to reassure _her_ that I meant it and it was still true. And I did, every time, happily. _That_ was something that got around my guilt.  
现在回想起来很容易，意识到每次明日香戳我并提醒我关于我的承诺，以及我有多傻，没有在第三次冲击前说些什么，她其实是在要求我向她保证我是认真的，承诺依然有效。而我每次都做到了，心甘情愿。这让我得以摆脱内疚。

It's strange, to think now how long it took for us to... work out our 'language'. Despite being so drawn to each other, similar backgrounds, and living together for over two years at that point, we only just then started to work out that 'you idiot' and 'I promised' were how we said something else entirely. Not that we even realized it ourselves until long after. We were both still hiding behind the surface of the words at that point.  
现在回想起来，真奇怪，我们花了多长时间才...弄清楚我们的‘语言’。尽管彼此吸引，背景相似，并且那时已经同居了两年多，我们直到那时才开始明白‘你这个白痴’和‘我答应了’其实是表达完全不同的意思。并非我们自己很久以后才意识到这一点。那时，我们都还躲在字面意思的背后。

It was enough. By June of 2018, Asuka had relentlessly, in her own way, chipped away at enough of my guilt that I was... not as bad. That is to say, she relentlessly _badgered_ me about looking or feeling guilty whenever she noticed, and made me admit I had tried more than anyone under more adverse circumstances than anyone could expect a 14 year old to face, and accepted huge amounts of pain on myself in the name of saving everyone. That I was a good person who did deserve some recognition for it.  
这就够了。到了 2018 年 6 月，尽管方式独特，但明日香毫不留情地消除了我大部分的罪恶感，让我...没那么糟糕了。也就是说，她总是不留情面地提醒我注意自己的内疚感，让我承认自己在比任何人都更不利的条件下，尝试得比任何人都多，承受了巨大的痛苦，为了拯救大家。她让我明白，我是一个值得为此得到认可的好人。

She was Asuka. She was implacable, unstoppable. Even when the subject was 'make Shinji feel better'. Which is just what I needed. Her unstoppable force met the immovable object of my guilt and shoved.  
她是明日香。她坚定不移，势不可挡。即使话题是‘让真嗣感觉好些’。这正是我所需要的。她那不可阻挡的力量遇到了我罪恶感的不可动摇之物，并推动了它。

So when June of 2018 came, and it was my birthday, and Asuka asked what _I_ wanted, she didn't let me get away with a mumbled 'nothing', or 'just some sheet music'. She knew me. Better than anyone. She pushed and poked and made me admit what I _did_ want.  
所以到了 2018 年 6 月，我生日那天，当明日香问我想要什么时，她没让我用含糊的‘没什么’或‘只要一些乐谱’蒙混过关。她了解我。比任何人都了解。她不断追问、试探，逼我承认我真正想要的东西。

A date with her.  
和她约会。

Not another 'double date' where we just sort of had two other people along and we were nominally dating them, not each other. (One of those got so bad it ended with the other pair leaving as a couple, and thanking _us_ for helping them get together.) Not another 'we're just going shopping together', or 'we're just going to this interview together at the same time'. An actual, no-pretending, 'I am asking you specifically out on a yes-that-kind date'.  
不是那种‘双重约会’，名义上我们各自和别人约会，而不是彼此。（其中一次糟糕到另一对情侣离开时成了真正的恋人，还感谢我们帮他们走到了一起。）也不是那种‘我们只是一起去购物’，或者‘我们只是同时去参加同一个面试’。一个真正的不带任何伪装，‘我特地邀请你参加那种约会’的约会。

I was less terrified facing Sachiel.  
面对萨基尔时，我还没这么害怕。

To be fair, Sachiel probably _was_ less scary than Asuka.  
公平地说，萨基尔可能比明日香要少些可怕。

She said yes. 她答应了。

Poets and sages have spent thousands of years trying to describe the sensation of 'falling in love'. They missed the obvious. That's what it feels like.  
诗人与智者花费了千年时光试图描绘‘坠入爱河’的感觉。他们忽略了显而易见的事实。就是这种感觉。

Falling.

Like free-fall. Except it never ends. I thought I loved her before then. I knew nothing. Being loved _back_ is... no drug, no liquor, nothing else is as intoxicating.  
如同自由落体。只不过永无止境。我曾以为在那之前就爱着她。我一无所知。被爱回是……没有任何药物、酒精，或其他任何东西能如此令人陶醉。

And this was just _dating_ her.  
而这仅仅是与她约会。

I know, it sounds silly. We were already living together. We were already seeing each other more than some married couples. Hell, we'd technically already _died_ together facing the Mass Production Evas. I sometimes wondered if there was some god out there getting a good laugh out of the way we seemed to be living our lives backwards, dying together, then falling in love, and _then_ dating.  
我知道，这听起来很傻。我们早已同居。我们见面的次数甚至超过了一些已婚夫妇。见鬼，我们在面对量产型 EVA 时已经技术上一起死过一次了。我有时会想，是不是有什么神明在天上看着我们这种倒着过日子的方式，笑得合不拢嘴——先是一起死去，然后坠入爱河，最后才开始约会。

But once we were 'officially' dating... as a... couple... I can't even describe it. I'll try anyway.  
但一旦我们‘正式’开始约会……作为……一对……我甚至无法形容那种感觉。尽管如此，我还是试试看吧。

Have you ever held your breath for 17 years, and then tasted air? Have you ever realized 'I have _two_ legs! I can walk!', and then stood up? Have you ever suddenly had someone who you _trusted_, who _listened_ to you?  
你是否曾经屏息 17 年，然后第一次呼吸到空气？你是否曾意识到‘我有两条腿！我能走路！’，然后站起来？你是否曾突然拥有一个你信任、愿意倾听你的人？

It's like that. 就是这样。

That's what saved us, what let us get through the guilt, the depression, the fear. I promised I'd never abandon her, my whole life. And she knew I meant it. And that gave her enough to grab me back, and hold on. To give an example...  
正是这救了我们，让我们能挺过愧疚、抑郁和恐惧。我承诺过一生一世不会离开她。她知道我是认真的。这给了她足够的勇气抓住我，紧紧不放。举个例子……

A few months later, we were just... sitting on the couch, talking (We were a long way from doing anything more than some kissing.) and we started talking about the guilt. Both of us. I... mentioned Kaworu. Asuka had missed that whole part, due to being catatonic, and I did not like to talk about it, so it was something she'd never heard the true, full story on, the one I never told _anyone_. Not Misato, not my therapist, no one.  
几个月后，我们只是……坐在沙发上聊天（那时我们还没发展到接吻之外的事），然后我们开始谈起愧疚感。两人都有。我……提到了薰。明日香因为当时处于紧张性精神症状态，错过了那一段，而我也不喜欢谈论它，所以她从未听过完整真实的版本，那个我从未对任何人讲过的故事。无论是美里，还是我的心理治疗师，没人听过。

The part where I was nearly catatonic myself after... after. The part where I spent hours washing and washing and washing my hands, trying to get the blood off, until I all but scrubbed my own skin off and they were bloody again in a different way. The part where I spent night after night screaming into a pillow, because I didn't deserve to make anyone else listen to my pain. The part where I deserved to suffer for killing him and hurting Asuka and failing everyone and-  
那段我几乎陷入木僵的时光……在那之后。那段我花了无数个小时不停地洗手，试图洗掉血迹，直到几乎搓掉自己的皮，双手再次以另一种方式流血。那段我夜复一夜对着枕头尖叫的时光，因为我没资格让任何人聆听我的痛苦。那段我应为杀了他、伤害了明日香、辜负了所有人而受苦的时光——

I mentioned we had breakdowns, yes?  
我提过我们崩溃了，对吧？

This was a 'good' one. As in, high-grade, best quality, falling-completely-100%-apart. I was an incoherent, screaming, crying mess for hours.  
这是一个‘好’的崩溃。就像，高级别的，顶级质量，完全、彻底、100%地崩溃。我连续几个小时语无伦次、尖叫、哭泣。

She never let go of me.  
她从未放开过我。

That night was the first night we went to bed together. No, not like that. We just... held each other. And in tiny, barely-there whispers after midnight Asuka had her own breakdown. Talking about her mother, her father, how she never in her whole life felt needed, wanted, or loved in her own right, not as a Pilot, until she came to Tokyo-3 and met us. Met me. About how my 'no attachments' mask wasn't nearly as good as I thought, and she could tell what I felt, and how much it hurt when I turned away from her. About how her mother's sacrifice in force-ejecting her and self-destructing Unit-02 had saved the day and both of us, but cost Asuka the only person she knew loved her back right then. About how finding out in Instrumentality that I had cared about her, but buried it had been the final stab in the heart and made her hate me for it for a long time. About how that had helped make her a mess for months after our 'victory'.  
那晚是我们第一次同床共枕。不，不是那种方式。我们只是……互相拥抱着。在午夜之后，微弱得几乎听不见的低语中，明日香崩溃了。她谈到了她的母亲、父亲，以及她一生中从未感到被需要、被渴望或被爱，不是作为驾驶员，而是直到她来到第三新东京市遇见了我们。遇见了我。关于我的‘不建立羁绊’的面具并没有我想象的那么完美，她能看穿我的感受，以及当我避开她时那种痛苦。关于她母亲强行弹射她并自毁二号机是如何拯救了那天和我们两人，但也让她失去了当时唯一知道爱她的人。关于在人类补完计划中得知我关心她却深藏不露，这成了刺入她心脏的最后一刀，让她因此恨了我很久。关于这如何让她在那场‘胜利’后的几个月里变得一团糟。

And about how the way I kept my promise even after she literally threw it back in my face finally convinced her it was real, and that it was safe for her to... let go like this as long as I was there with her.  
还有关于我如何在她实际上将承诺抛回我脸上后依然坚守诺言，最终让她相信那是真实的，并且只要我在她身边，她就可以放心地……这样放手。

And she did. She crumbled as hard as I did, not eight hours after I had. It was probably not the safest idea for us both to go to pieces like that in the same day, but... it was us. It was just for us, for each other. We could not have let ourselves be ourselves and relax our guards like that for anyone else. It only worked because we were who we were for each other.  
她确实如此。她崩溃得和我一样彻底，仅仅在我之后不到八小时。或许我们俩在同一天都这样崩溃并不是最安全的想法，但是...这就是我们。这只是为了我们彼此。我们不能对其他人那样做自己，放松警惕。只有因为我们是为彼此而存在的，这才能奏效。

When the sun rose the next morning, we were still holding each other, and the world was ok.  
当第二天早晨太阳升起时，我们依然紧紧相拥，世界一切安好。

After that, the fall was easier. The autumn, I mean.  
在那之后，秋天变得容易度过。我是说，秋天。

We started sleeping together nightly, in what had once been Misato's old room. Asuka insisted on a European-style bed, though. She insisted futons were dumb. I didn't care.  
我们开始每晚一起睡在曾经是美里旧房间的地方。但明日香坚持要一张欧式床，她认为榻榻米很傻。我倒无所谓。

She also insisted that I hold her and say it out loud every night. I did care about that, eagerly.  
她还坚持要我每晚抱着她并大声说出来。这一点我很乐意去做。

I noticed, but did not _mind_ that she never said it back. Just 'you idiot'. Tone says a lot. And I was finally starting to speak our 'language'.  
我注意到，但并不介意她从未回应过。只是‘你这个傻瓜’。语气能说明很多。而我终于开始学会说我们的‘语言’了。

So that December 4th, on her 17th birthday, all I had to say when I gave her something else, something new was 'I promised'.  
于是，在她的十七岁生日，12 月 4 日那天，当我递给她一件新东西时，我只需说：‘我承诺过。’

The ring fit perfectly.  
戒指恰好合适。

She said yes. 她答应了。

And then she said 'you idiot' out loud. Except this time she finally said what I'd heard behind the words for months.  
然后她大声说了句‘你这个白痴’。只不过这次，她终于说出了我几个月来一直听到的藏在话后的心声。

And that's the story of how I made Asuka Langley Soryu's 17th birthday a good one: I made her cry.  
这就是我如何让惣流·明日香·兰格雷的 17 岁生日变得美好的故事：我让她哭了。

---

Everyone at the party applauded. Hikari nearly exploded. Misato gave us a bottle of 'fertility sake'. Asuka nearly made _her_ drink it.  
派对上的每个人都鼓掌了。光几乎要气炸了。美里给了我们一瓶‘多子清酒’。明日香差点逼她喝下去。

New Year's was nice. As was January. And... well, you get the idea.  
新年挺好的。一月也不错。而且……嗯，你懂的。

I managed to coast to February before panic set in. _OhholyshitIamengagedtobemarriedandIhavenoideawhatI'mdoing  
我勉强撑到了二月才陷入恐慌。_哦天哪我要结婚了而我完全不知道自己在干什么  
_  
Fortunately, Asuka was _also_ panicking, so we more or less balanced each other out. Yes, I know that sounds stupid. Shut up.  
幸运的是，明日香也在慌，所以我们或多或少互相平衡了一下。是的，我知道这听起来很蠢。闭嘴。

Yes, I know that sounds more like her than Shinji the Doormat. Benefits of being with her.  
是的，我知道这听起来更像她而不是懦弱的真嗣。和她在一起的好处。

Finally I set a date to figure out a plan, and after a long cuddle session with her helped, sat down to figure things out.  
最终我定下了一个日期来制定计划，和她长时间的拥抱后，我坐下来开始理清思路。

...Ok, _we_ sat down and she pointed out I was the baka, she was the genius, so I should hold her beer and watch this while _she_ figured things out. (Metaphorically speaking. Misato's example kind of ensured that neither of us were really drinkers.)  
...好吧，我们坐下来，她指出我是笨蛋，她是天才，所以我应该拿着她的啤酒（比喻说法。美里姐的例子让我们俩都不怎么喝酒。）看着她搞定一切。

First hurdle couples in our situation usually faced was financial security and a place to live. We had that already taken care of. In fact, with the stipends the reformed UN and Japanese government had handed us, we could have lived the rest of our lives in not-inconsiderable comfort without ever working again. Seeing as we had effectively no financial worries and a place to ourselves already, that was easy. Next came the harder bit: We were both well below Japan's age of majority so in theory we weren't _allowed_ to get married until... 2021.  
我们这种情况的情侣通常面临的首个难题是财务保障和居住地。这些我们已经解决了。事实上，有了联合国和日本政府改革后给予我们的津贴，我们完全可以不工作，舒适地度过余生。既然我们没有财务上的担忧，也有自己的住处，这倒不难。接下来才是更棘手的部分：我们都未达到日本的法定成年年龄，所以在理论上，我们直到 2021 年才能结婚。

As Asuka said: "Fuck that."  
正如明日香所说：“去他的。”

Option one: Go to the US or Germany, where Asuka had citizenship, and the age of majority was lower. Problem: The US still required parental permission until Asuka was 18, and Germany required talking to Asuka's father anyway.  
选项一：去美国或德国，明日香拥有这些国家的公民身份，且法定成年年龄较低。问题在于：美国仍要求明日香年满 18 岁前需父母同意，而德国则无论如何都需要与明日香的父亲沟通。

To which Asuka said: "Fuck that _twice_."  
对此，明日香回应道：“去他的，两次都不干。”

Fortunately, we had another option besides waiting a year or having to talk to the second-worst father in the world. (Even Asuka admitted no one came close to my father.)  
幸运的是，除了等待一年或不得不与世界上第二糟糕的父亲交谈之外，我们还有另一个选择。（就连明日香也承认，没人能比得上我父亲。）

"Mister Ikari, this is very irregular. Neither of you are even 18, let alone 20, and-"  
“碇先生，这非常不合常规。你们俩甚至都不到 18 岁，更别提 20 岁了，而且——”

"Should I be calling the Prime Minister's office? Or the Imperial Majordomo? I have both of their numbers. I'm sure they'd love to hear all about the trouble 'The Boy and Girl Who Saved The World' are having with the Prefectural Registry Office."  
"我应该给首相办公室打电话吗？还是找皇室总管？我手头有他们两位的号码。我相信他们一定很乐意听听‘拯救世界的男孩和女孩’在县登记处遇到的麻烦。"

"M-mister Ikari! There's no need to-"  
"碇先生！没必要——"

"Then you can get the paperwork done promptly. We have a date chosen, and we do not want delays."  
"那么你就能迅速完成文书工作。我们已经选定了日期，不希望有任何延误。"

I was the one making this phone call, since Asuka was busy running a camera aimed at me, and trying her hardest not to scream with laughter. Apparently when I get angry and have to deal with annoying people on the phone, I turn into a disconcertingly close imitation of my father's old 'icy growl and scary face'. On one hand, I hate even being that much like him. On the other hand, the reason Asuka was running the camera is she finds my 'Gendo Ikari impersonation' to be _hysterical_.  
这次打电话的人是我，因为明日香正忙着用相机对准我，并竭尽全力不让自己笑出声来。显然，当我生气并不得不应付电话里那些讨厌的人时，我会变成一个令人不安的、与我父亲过去的‘冰冷咆哮和可怕面孔’极为相似的模仿者。一方面，我甚至讨厌自己有那么像他。另一方面，明日香之所以操作相机，是因为她觉得我的‘碇源堂模仿秀’极其滑稽。

And I like making her laugh more than anything.  
而我最喜欢的就是逗她笑。

So yeah, I browbeat the Prefectural Registry Office with our special legal status and effective blank check from the government. So far, all we'd asked from them was to be left in peace. Now I tossed them the slightly more thorny bit of 'we're 17 and want to get married before we're 18.' They folded.  
没错，我利用我们的特殊法律地位和政府提供的有效空白支票，对县登记处施加了压力。到目前为止，我们只要求他们让我们安静地待着。现在，我抛给他们一个稍微棘手的问题：‘我们 17 岁，想在 18 岁之前结婚。’他们屈服了。

Well, before _she_ was 18. Asuka picked the date, and I couldn't find any reason to gainsay her choice. It would be shortly after my 18th birthday in June. She picked August 25th.  
嗯，在她 18 岁之前。日期是明日香选的，我找不到任何理由反驳她的选择。那将是在我 6 月 18 岁生日之后的不久。她选了 8 月 25 日。

The day we met.  
我们相遇的那天。

I admitted it was fitting and poetic, to get married four years to the day we met aboard the _Over The Rainbow_. She smugly replied that of course it was, she was German and therefore eminently cultured and perfect. I pointed at her not-at-all-hidden pile of extremely smutty yaoi 'romance' manga she had under her bed. She hit me with a pillow and called me an idiot. I pulled her shirt up over her head and tickled her stomach, she blindly dragged my shorts down to around my ankles to make me trip, I fell on top of her...  
我承认这既合适又富有诗意，在我们相遇于彩虹之上号四周年的那天结婚。她得意地回答说当然如此，她是德国人，因此极具文化和完美。我指着她床下那堆毫不掩饰的极其色情的耽美‘浪漫’漫画。她用枕头打我，并称我为白痴。我拉起她的衬衫蒙住她的头，挠她的肚子，她则盲目地将我的短裤拉到脚踝处，让我绊倒，我跌倒在她身上……

Our arguments were a lot more fun that year.  
那年的争吵变得有趣多了。

Misato was mildly surprised when we told her we were getting married after only nine months of being engaged, but was happy for us. Asuka's poker face held. Mine almost did, but Misato wasn't dumb. She noticed me sweating.  
当我们告诉美里只订婚九个月就决定结婚时，她有些惊讶，但为我们感到高兴。明日香保持着扑克脸。我差点也做到了，但美里并不傻。她注意到我在冒汗。

She looked at me suspiciously. "What aren't you telling me, Shinji?"  
她怀疑地看着我。"你还有什么没告诉我，真嗣？"

I sweated more.

Asuka rolled her eyes. "I should have known you couldn't withstand the terrible power of being mildly questioned for thirty seconds, baka Shinji."  
明日香翻了个白眼。“我早该知道你连三十秒的轻微质疑都承受不住，笨蛋真嗣。”

Misato turned her inquisitorial look on her. "Got something to confess, Asuka?"  
美里用审视的目光看着她。“有什么要坦白的吗，明日香？”

"Yeah, I'm faster than you."

"Huh?"

"We figure August is both poetically appropriate, and I won't be showing yet," Asuka said smugly, flipping her hair.  
“我们觉得八月既富有诗意，我又还没显怀，”明日香得意地说，甩了甩头发。

"What are yo-...holy shit." Misato froze.

"I mean, come on, you and Kaji have been married a whole year and then some now, and you're still-YEEK!"  
"我是说，拜托，你和加持已经结婚一年多了，可你还是——哎呀！"

Misato picked Asuka up and swung her around. "You little... AHAAHAHAH! You two! How?"  
美里把明日香抱起来转了一圈。 "你这个小...啊哈哈哈！你们俩！怎么回事？"

"Well, when a man and a woman love each other very mu-" Asuka sarcastically began.  
"嗯，当一个男人和一个女人非常相爱——"" 明日香讽刺地开始说道。

Misato put her down on my lap. "Oh, knock it off!"  
美里把她放在我腿上。“哦，别这样！”

"Come on, Misato. How do you think we did it? Same way everyone else does. And once I got baka Shinji into bed, I hardly let him out. He had _years_ of making up to do." Asuka's smug smile could have put an entire destruction of cats to shame.  
“来吧，美里。你以为我们是怎么做到的？和其他人一样。一旦我把笨蛋真嗣弄上床，我就几乎不让他下床了。他得花好几年时间来弥补。”明日香得意的笑容足以让一群猫的毁灭都相形见绌。

Yes, destruction. That's the collective noun for a group of cats. No, I'm not kidding. Go look it up. English is weird.  
是的，毁灭。这是猫群的集体名词。不，我不是在开玩笑。去查查吧。英语很奇怪。

Yes, I know English now. Asuka made me learn. And Deutsch, aber natürlich. You didn't think we spent _all_ of our time laying around stress-testing our bedframe, did you?  
是的，我现在懂英语了。明日香让我学的。还有德语，当然。你不会以为我们所有时间都在床上躺着测试床架的承重吧，对吧？

Misato eventually settled for being only slightly envious that Asuka and I had managed to catch after less than six months of...trying. Ahem. We didn't _exactly_ plan it, so much as just be really sloppy about protection in the first few months of actually 'sleeping together'. We were kind of enjoying ourselves too much to care, and while we initially panicked _badly_ when Asuka realized she was late, we were 4 months into being engaged, and mostly got over it fairly quickly.  
美里最终只是略感羡慕，因为明日香和我不到六个月就成功了……尝试。咳咳。我们并没有特别计划，只是在最初几个月真正‘睡在一起’时，对保护措施相当马虎。我们当时玩得太开心，根本不在乎，而当初日香意识到自己迟了时，我们虽然一开始非常慌张，但那时我们已经订婚四个月了，大部分时间很快就平静下来。

Ok, yeah, there's a lot of qualifiers there, I admit.  
好吧，是的，我承认那里有很多限定条件。

It really did test us, how far we'd come and the limits of what we'd achieved in therapy. Asuka had spent most of her life since menarche being _aggressively_ not interested in being a mother. Not after the childhood she'd had, and what happened to her mother. The ugly stress on their relationship Asuka's father and step-mother went through during their many years of trying to have a child of their own didn't help either, since Asuka had an unwilling ringside seat for that until she basically left home entirely for Pilot training.  
这确实考验了我们，看看我们在治疗中走了多远，以及我们达到了怎样的极限。自初潮以来，明日香大部分时间都强烈地不想成为母亲。不仅仅是因为她的童年经历，还有她母亲遭遇的不幸。明日香的父亲和继母在多年尝试生育自己孩子的过程中所经历的丑陋压力，也没有起到任何帮助作用，因为明日香不情愿地旁观了这一切，直到她基本上离家去接受飞行员训练。

We had a few bad nights. On the good side, she rapidly got over blaming me for the situation. We'd progressed that much. On the other hand, that meant she had a nasty relapse of terror at the idea of herself being good enough to be a mother, and of being only 17, and so on. At least I could...well, all I really could do was hold her and constantly reassure her (and myself!) that we were not our parents, and we were damn sure not going to be like them or treat our... our kid like that.  
我们有几个糟糕的夜晚。好在，她很快就不再怪罪我这个情况了。我们的关系已经进步到了这一步。另一方面，这意味着她对成为一个足够好的母亲的想法感到恐惧，而且她还只有 17 岁，等等。至少我能做的...好吧，我真正能做的就是抱着她，不断地安慰她（也安慰我自己！），我们不是我们的父母，我们绝不会像他们那样，也不会那样对待我们的...我们的孩子。

We carried on. Focusing on getting things ready was oddly a help, since panicking for the wedding kept us from panicking over anything after that. We could panic about that after the wedding was done.  
我们继续前行。专注于准备事宜出奇地有帮助，因为为婚礼而焦虑让我们无暇顾及之后的事情。那些焦虑可以等到婚礼结束后再去面对。

August came too fast and too slow. So did the 25th.  
八月来得太快又太慢。25 号也是如此。

I wish that day could have lasted forever.  
我多么希望那一天能永远持续下去。

It was like a dream. Word had leaked out, somehow, and the Imperial Household Agency had called _us_, offering the Palace as a venue. They mostly wanted to associate the Imperial Family with whatever glory there was playing host to the wedding of 'The Boy and Girl Who Saved The World', but Asuka was only too happy to accept the spotlight for us, and as she'd well learned by that point, I would refuse her nothing if it made her happy.  
那感觉就像一场梦。消息不知怎么走漏了，宫内厅联系了我们，提出将皇宫作为婚礼场地。他们主要是想让皇室与这场被誉为‘拯救世界的男孩和女孩’的婚礼沾上光，但明日香对此乐此不疲，愿意为我们接受这份瞩目，而正如她那时已经深谙其道，只要能让她开心，我什么都不会拒绝。

She glowed. I managed not to faint. She truly did look like a princess.  
她光彩照人。我努力没有晕倒。她真的像一位公主。

By October she was obvious. By November, enormous. And as December drew close, varying between tremulous and murderous. I kept her calm with footrubs. Lots of them.  
到了十月，她的身孕已经很明显了。到了十一月，更是大得惊人。而随着十二月的临近，她的情绪时而颤抖时而暴躁。我通过给她按摩脚来让她平静下来。很多次。

And because our lives are apparently never done with cosmic irony, she went into labor the day before her 18th birthday.  
而因为我们的生活中显然永远不乏宇宙级的讽刺，她在 18 岁生日的前一天开始分娩。

For 18 hours.

"I... am... going... to... KILL... YOU... SHINJI..."  
"我...要...杀了...你...真嗣..."

"Just breathe, Asuka." "深呼吸，明日香。"

"Come... into... range... I... want... to... strangle... youOOOOOW OW OW OW OW AAAARRRG!" Her eyes rolled up in her head and she passed out with the last push. She came around a little later, feeling emptied.  
"来...进入...范围...我...想...掐...你——哎哟哟哟哟哟哟！" 她的眼睛翻了上去，随着最后一次用力，她昏了过去。稍后她苏醒过来，感觉身体被掏空。

"Are we done? I... is it a boy or a girl?" she asked weakly. We'd declined an ultrasound determination ahead of time. We'd prepared male and female names either way. Ryouji or Kyoko was fine with me.  
"我们结束了吗？我...是男孩还是女孩？" 她虚弱地问道。我们事先拒绝了超声波性别鉴定。无论男女，我们都准备了相应的名字。龙司或京子，对我来说都无所谓。

Asuka's eyes were barely open. I hesitated. "Um..." I gulped. "A boy..."  
明日香的眼睛几乎睁不开。我犹豫了一下。"呃..." 我咽了口唾沫。"是个男孩..."

Asuka smiled. "So, Ryouji it is-"  
明日香微笑道：“那么，就是凌二了——”

"Both of them." “两个都是。”

"...what?"

I handed her Ryouji, carefully swaddled. "Here's Ryouji... and his little brother by 15 minutes, Kaworu." I held him up, nestled in my arms.  
我将裹得严严实实的凌二递给她。“这是凌二……还有他早出生 15 分钟的弟弟，薰。”我抱着他，轻轻地托在怀里。

"Kaworu?" Asuka blinked her eyes open a bit more. "Twins? I..." She took in my hesitant, almost fearful look. "I suppose that's a nice name."  
"「薰？」明日香微微睁大了眼睛。「双胞胎？我……」她注意到了我犹豫不决、几乎带着恐惧的表情。「我想，那是个好名字。」

I almost wilted in relief. "I'm sorry, they... they asked me, and you were still out, and I... just... it was the first thing I could think of, and-"  
我几乎因解脱而瘫软下来。「对不起，他们……他们问我，而你还在昏迷，我……只是……这是我第一时间能想到的，而且——」

She very wearily raised her arm not occupied by baby and waved at me. "It's fine, baka. He... I know what he meant to you. It's... a good name."  
她非常疲惫地举起未被婴儿占据的那只手向我挥了挥。「没事的，笨蛋。他……我知道他对你意味着什么。这是个……好名字。」

"...it's four in the morning, Asuka. Happy birthday. You and... our sons."  
"...现在是凌晨四点，明日香。生日快乐。你和...我们的儿子们。"

She chuckled weakly. "That'll keep them from forgetting their mom's birthday." She looked down at the perfect, tiny blue eyes vaguely looking up at her general direction. "Welcome to the world we saved, kids. Your mom and dad are even more scared than you are, but we're still kicking. Welcome to the party. Happy birthday to us all."  
她虚弱地轻笑了一声。“这样他们就不会忘记妈妈的生日了。”她低头看着那双完美无瑕、微微仰望她方向的蓝色小眼睛。“欢迎来到我们拯救的世界，孩子们。你们的妈妈和爸爸比你们还要害怕，但我们依然在坚持。欢迎来到这个派对。祝我们所有人，生日快乐。”

And that's how for her 18th birthday, Asuka Langley Soryu gave us both presents, and I was the one to cry this time.  
就这样，在她 18 岁生日那天，惣流·明日香·兰格雷给了我们两人礼物，而这次哭的人是我。
