Shinji and Asuka return to Tokyo-3 after eight years. Yup, that's it. Some language. One shot.  
真嗣和明日香在八年后回到东京-3。

Asuka had determined it was going to burn.  
明日香已经断定，一切终将化为灰烬。

I learned this at a pit stop in Hazu, when I popped the trunk to find two gas cans guarding my Fall of Goat Island CD.  
我在濑户市的一个加油站学到了这一点，当时我打开后备箱，发现两罐汽油守护着我的《山羊岛陷落》CD。

We would visit Hikari. Spur of the moment. I would drive and Asuka would pack; we shook on it in her bare Nagoya loft lording over Higashiyama Park. Between slurps of shark fin ramen, Asuka insisted on the deal. The compromise. As the signs for Tokyo-3 grow frequent, ward-specific, I tell myself I insisted on it, too.  
我们会去光市。一时兴起。我来开车，明日香负责打包；我们在她名古屋的简陋阁楼里握手成交，俯瞰着东山公园。在吸食鱼翅拉面的间隙，明日香坚持要达成协议。妥协。随着东京-3 区的标志越来越频繁、具体，我告诉自己我也坚持了这一点。

Arrows and numbers and kanji all funnel Asuka and I into Ohno Mountain Tunnel as she dials down the volume on track 3: _One Flew Over_ or something or other. It's the best song, meaning it's the most urgent one, meaning Asuka hates it. I become satisfied with letting the muffled bass line beat on my chest.  
箭头、数字和汉字将我和明日香引向大野山隧道，她调低了第三轨的音量：《飞越疯人院》之类的。这是最好的歌，意味着它最紧迫，意味着明日香讨厌它。我满足于让那低沉的贝斯线在胸口跳动。

"Just what did you think I'm going to fill them with?" she asks.  
"你以为我会用什么填满它们？" 她问道。

"I didn't even know they were back there."  
"我甚至不知道它们在那里。"

"Poo on you. Maybe you should be more suspicious when I ask you to do things for me," says Asuka. She sucks her teeth_, tsk, tsk, tsk_.  
"你真糟糕。也许当我让你为我做事时，你应该更警觉些，" 明日香说。她咂了咂嘴，啧啧啧。

"So you're saying I shouldn't trust you?"  
"所以你是说我不能相信你？"

"Yeah, exactly." She gives me a small shove on my shoulder. "Okay, bad joke. I'm just saying that premium outlets go up on prime real estate like that all the time. If you can't get away from the city you still have to get away from the city."  
"对，没错。" 她轻轻推了一下我的肩膀。"好吧，玩笑开得不好。我只是说，高档购物中心经常建在那样黄金地段。即使你离不开城市，你也得设法离开城市。"

"Yeah." “嗯。”

"They razed Wondergirl's place months ago, did you know that? It's time I did my part." If Asuka was waiting for me to nod or shrug it off, I disappoint her. She leans forward, far enough to be irradiated by the day glow dashboard. The position makes it easier for her to pierce the corner of my eye with a neon green smile. "Come on. Our old place, it's a blight. It's an affront to revisionist history. And we were the only ones living in it, anyway. It was just a matter of time before someone knocked it over."  
"他们几个月前就把 Wondergirl 的地方拆了，你知道吗？现在该轮到我尽一份力了。" 如果明日香在等我点头或一笑置之，那她要失望了。她向前倾身，足够让日光灯照亮仪表盘辐射到她。这个姿势让她更容易用那抹荧光绿的笑容刺穿我眼角的余光。"来吧。我们以前住的地方，已经成了眼中钉。对修正主义历史来说是一种冒犯。而且我们本来就是那里唯一的住户，反正。迟早会有人把它推倒的。"

"Then maybe you should just let them take it down," I say. "They're professionals."  
"那或许你该让他们拆掉它，"我说，"他们是专业人士。"

"Exactly." "正是如此。"

I glance sideways at the blur of white tile and dashed lights peeling off to reveal Tokyo-3 – the new one, the city on Mandelbrot Lake – molten night life surging between its skyscrapers. The view should warm me, melt me, but my ghost in the window keeps cold; or steadfast, I like steadfast better. Because I've been driving for six straight hours, with Asuka prowling the passenger seat. I am determined to share her with Hikari tonight.  
我侧目瞥向窗外，白色瓷砖与断续灯光的模糊掠影，逐渐揭开东京-3 的面纱——新生的城市，坐落于曼德尔布罗特湖畔——熔岩般的夜生活在其摩天大楼间涌动。这景象本应温暖我，融化我，但窗中我的倒影依旧冰冷；或者说坚定，我更喜欢坚定这个词。因为我已经连续驾驶了六个小时，而明日香在副驾驶座上如野兽般躁动。今晚，我决心要让她与光见面。

Between chest thumps of tempo Asuka stops looking at me – she stops grinning. I don't think she can do either while charging her voice with that kryptonite compassion: "You look so worried, Shinji. Don't be. You're pretty much the most retardant thing ever."  
随着节奏的胸膛敲击，明日香不再看我——她不再咧嘴笑。我想她在用那种氪石般的同情心充电时，无法做到这两件事：“你看起来很担心，真嗣。别担心。你几乎是世界上最不傻的人了。”

It's a joke, most likely. Some English pun at my expense. I tell myself it has something to do with me missing our exit.  
这很可能是个笑话，大概是拿我开涮的英文双关语。我告诉自己，这和我错过了我们的出口有关。

Hikari Horaki has that disease, the one where some strain of proficiency seeps from her pores; that presses her curtains and shampoos her carpet; that sweetens her tea and tarts her pies; that cuffs and coddles baby sisters – the one where you hardly notice the wiping of tears or bandaging of cuts or salving of burns because the pie is so unbelievably good.  
洞木光患有那种病，某种从她毛孔中渗出的卓越才能；它熨烫她的窗帘，洗护她的地毯；它使她的茶变甜，让她的派变酸；它约束并宠爱着年幼的妹妹——那种你几乎注意不到擦泪、包扎伤口或治疗烧伤的病，因为那派实在太好吃了。

"It's an easy recipe." Hikari's propping up her smile with a fist as she sits with me and Asuka, her embroidered sleeves falling to her elbow. She's dropped the pigtails, but kept the freckles, which brings out the wholesomeness in her chocolate eyes. "It's yours if you want it."  
"这是个简单的食谱。" 光用拳头撑着她的微笑，和我们一起坐着，她的刺绣袖子垂到肘部。她放下了双马尾，但保留了雀斑，这让她的巧克力色眼睛更显纯真。"如果你想要，它就是你的。"

I'm going to say sure. I'm going to ask Asuka for her slice, which she hasn't so much as wounded. I lick raspberry cobbler from the roof of my mouth, swallow, and almost ask Hikari about Touji Suzahara.  
我会说当然。我会向明日香要她的那份，她几乎还没动过。我舔去嘴里的覆盆子馅饼，吞下，差点问起光关于铃原东治的事。

"Of course he wants it. Big wad of good it'll do him, though. You can't fix _blah_." Thanks, Asuka.  
"他当然想要。不过，这对他没什么好处。你没法修复无聊。" 谢谢，明日香。

"I don't see why it just has to be for him. Why don't you try? Why don't…" Hikari's eyes go wide and she gasps – she's choking on an awkward piece of demented fantasy. "Why don't you two do it together?"  
"我不明白为什么非得是他。你为什么不试试？你为什么不……" 光的眼眸瞪大，她倒吸一口气——被一段尴尬的疯狂幻想噎住了。"你们俩为什么不一起做呢？"

Asuka stops shepherding the pie slice on her plate. The eyebrow she raises at Hikari is bent and queer.  
明日香停止了在她盘子里摆弄派的动作。她对光扬起的眉毛显得扭曲而古怪。

"It's a vote," Hikari answers. "You get to vote for how Shinji cooks for you, like Nozomi does with me. The hardest part is letting someone else help, and you don't have that problem with Shinji."  
"这是投票，" 光回答道。"你可以投票决定真嗣怎么为你做饭，就像望美对我做的那样。最难的部分是让别人帮忙，而你对真嗣没有这个问题。"

"I _don't_ have that problem with Shinji." Asuka holds me with a wink and a curly-q smirk.  
"我对真嗣没有这个问题。" 明日香眨眼间带着一丝俏皮的微笑看着我。

"I sauté the chicken and onions and the carrots," Hikari continues, "and she takes charge of the spices. I can't make it any other way, now; I try to, but Nozomi won't let me. We do it on Tuesdays – you should've come on Tuesday!"  
"我炒鸡肉和洋葱，还有胡萝卜，" 光继续说，"她负责调料。我现在不能用其他方式做了；我试过，但渚不让我。我们周二做这个——你周二应该来的！"

"I give lectures on Tuesday," says Asuka.  
"我周二有讲座，" 明日香说。

"Yeah," I say, "I'm _blah_ on Tuesday." The sound Hikari makes while getting up is an eighth-hearted chuckle; and that's all I'm looking for, pity applause for the effort. I don't know what it means when Asuka deep throats the raspberry gore off my fork.  
“嗯，”我说，“周二我有点无精打采。”光起身时发出的声音是那种半心半意的轻笑；而这正是我所寻求的，对努力的同情掌声。我不知道当明日香吞下我叉子上的覆盆子血块时意味着什么。

The rolodex Hikari brings back to the table is a sad thing, overstuffed. She runs a finger over its index cards –which are compressed by love, maybe explosive tension – searching for the name or number or recipe she can remove without making the thing go off. "Oh, just write it down for him, you big fat showoff," says Asuka.

"That's big fat improviser." Hikari gives her head a slow shake. "I don't actually remember the original recipe, which is the problem. The kids all like so many different things. They just, they end up filling everything."  
“那是大胖子即兴表演者。”光缓缓摇头，“问题是我其实不记得原版食谱了。孩子们喜欢的东西各不相同。他们只是，最终把一切都填满了。”

"The kids or the things?" I ask.  
"孩子还是东西？" 我问道。

"I wish you could stay another day," Hikari answers. I could be imagining her cheeks growing a bit rosy, sure, but then the kinks in her breath start to smooth out. "You could come down to the daycare. They practically know you already because I tell all of them about you…I said that already, didn't I?"  
"真希望你能多留一天，" 光回答。我或许是在想象她的脸颊微微泛红，但随即她呼吸中的不顺畅开始平复。"你可以去幼儿园看看。他们几乎已经认识你了，因为我总是跟他们提起你……我是不是已经说过了？"

"Yes," says Asuka. "是的，" 明日香说道。

"Asuka, they adore you. I showed them your picture, you remember, um, your strawberry-print yukata? Eiji – Hiroko, from 3A, that's her boy – I caught him hiding it in his lunch bag. The girls always talk about how you wore your hair back then. They just love you. I tell them about all of us. Not that I ever did anything as exciting."  
"明日香，他们非常喜欢你。我给他们看了你的照片，记得吗，那个印有草莓图案的浴衣？英二——3A 的广子，那是她的儿子——我看到他把照片藏在午餐袋里。女孩们总是谈论你那时候的发型。他们就是喜欢你。我告诉他们我们所有人的故事。虽然我从未做过什么令人兴奋的事。"

"I wouldn't have called it exciting," says Asuka.  
"我不会称之为令人兴奋的，"明日香说。"

"Well, you know what I…" Hikari's voice creaks along like old midnight floorboards. "Of course not." It takes a second for Hikari to discover the black knot buried in the pinewood grain of the table. She smiles at it before getting up again, pushing her sleeves back up her forearms, and squeezing the sponge from the back of the sink.  
"嗯，你知道我……"光的声音像老旧的午夜地板一样吱吱作响。"当然不是。"光花了片刻时间才发现桌子上松木纹理中隐藏的黑色结节。她对着它微笑，然后再次起身，将袖子推回前臂，从水槽后面挤出海绵。"

If she wants my help with the dishes, she'll ask.  
如果她需要我帮忙洗碗，她会开口的。

Nozomi Horaki has that disease, the one where some strain of deficiency seeps from her pores; that splashes her curtains and smears her carpet; that spills her tea and drops her pies; that miffs and mollifies older sisters – the one where you hardly notice the molding of clay or painting of canvases or sculpting of torsos because the pie is so unbelievably mashed into the carpet.  
Nozomi Horaki 患上了那种病，一种缺陷从她毛孔中渗出；它溅湿了她的窗帘，弄脏了她的地毯；它打翻了她的茶，弄掉了她的派；它惹恼了姐姐，又安抚了她们——那种让你几乎注意不到黏土的塑造、画布的绘制或躯体的雕刻，因为派不可思议地被压进了地毯。

Tonight, I get to stay in her room. It is a swelter of crippled easels, dirty bras, and crumpled acrylic paint tubes. But with Asuka sharing Hikari's bed tonight, it does make possible the least awkward of our potential sleeping arrangements; Asuka totally nailed an impression of herself earlier, announcing how if she and I shared a room, I'd just end up awake all night, undressing her with my eyes. Then she announced she was taking a shower.  
今晚，我可以留在她的房间。这里闷热不堪，到处是残破的画架、脏内衣和皱巴巴的丙烯颜料管。但既然 Asuka 今晚和 Hikari 同床，这确实让我们的潜在睡眠安排变得不那么尴尬；Asuka 之前完全模仿了自己，宣布说如果她和我在一个房间，我肯定会整夜不睡，用眼神剥光她。然后她宣布要去洗澡。

The consequence of looking for space to drop my bag is that I have to take inventory of Nozomi's room. I keep trying to separate things – futon, pillow, drawer, floor, ceiling – when really, it's a jungle. An environment this lush isn't meant to be parsed and catalogued. When I hear knocking, I tell myself I'm happy with just knowing where the door is. Happier with watching Hikari open, slog through, and close it; if she doesn't mind the uncinched button on the V-neck of her pajama top, then neither do I.  
寻找放包的空间的后果是我不得不清点望月的房间。我一直在试图区分物品——被褥、枕头、抽屉、地板、天花板——但实际上，这里是一片丛林。如此茂盛的环境并不适合解析和分类。当我听到敲门声时，我告诉自己，只要知道门在哪里就满足了。更乐意看着光里打开门，费力穿过，然后关上门；如果她不介意睡衣 V 领上未扣紧的扣子，那我也不介意。

When she looks at me, I make sure I'm studying a spot on the ceiling, the one where a color wheel exploded. "It's a Murakami," I say, looking back down.  
当她看着我时，我确保自己在研究天花板上的一个点，那个色彩轮爆炸的地方。“这是村上隆的作品，”我回望下来时说道。

"It's a disaster. She's been a cyclone since her exhibition." The flapping motion she makes as she slaps her thighs flashes the floral trunks beneath her shirt. "You're so good to put up with this."  
“这简直是灾难。自从她的展览以来，她就像龙卷风一样。”她拍打大腿的动作让她衬衫下的花哨短裤一闪而过。“你能忍受这些真是太好了。”

I give a good shrug, laying to rest the hope she'd invite me to sleep in the living room. "I have lots of practice – thank Misato."  
我无所谓地耸耸肩，打消了她可能会邀请我在客厅过夜的希望。“我有很多练习——多亏了美里。”

"Maybe later. But let's do this, now, she can't stay in the shower forever." Hikari plops down on a slope of cargo pants and wrinkled tees, sinking so far into it I fear she's being swallowed by its designer maw. She pats the spot next to her instead of covering up the little bit of her that's going a long way.  
“也许晚点吧。但现在，我们得行动了，她总不能一直在浴室里不出来。”光坐在一堆皱巴巴的牛仔裤和 T 恤上，陷得那么深，我担心她会被这个设计师的深渊吞没。她拍了拍旁边的位置，而不是遮住那一点点露出的部分，效果却出奇地好。

"You didn't ask me about Touji," she says.  
“你没问我关于真治的事，”她说。

My lips taste like cinnamon mouthwash. "It's not really my place."  
我的唇间弥漫着肉桂味漱口水的味道。“这不太合适吧。”

"Of course it's your place…" I'm not as stunned to find myself sitting next to Hikari as I am by the weight of the two paper scraps she places in my hand: it is indeed a very easy recipe; and though I don't recognize the phone number that goes with it, I've obliterated this street in a hundred-hundred simulations. "You're sure you can't stay another day? Forget about the space – Nozomi loves driving Kodama crazy."  
“当然合适……”坐在光旁边，我并没有太惊讶，反倒是她放在我手里的两张纸条让我感到沉重：这确实是一个非常简单的食谱；尽管我不认识上面的电话号码，但我已经在无数次模拟中摧毁过这条街道。“你确定不能再多留一天吗？别管空间的事了——希喜欢把儿玉逼疯。”

"I'm sorry. Asuka really does have to teach class on Tuesday."  
“对不起。明日香周二确实有课要教。”

"It's a bit random." Hikari plucks a lint specimen from the culture on her sleeve. "You two coming all this way on a Sunday just to see me…I'm a little flattered."  
"有点突然呢。" 光从袖子上的培养物中挑出一粒绒毛样本。"你们俩周日特意跑这么远来看我……我有点受宠若惊。"

"Asuka was itching to make time for you. I don't know. This is the best she can do until a sabbatical, and who knows when that'll be."  
"明日香一直想抽时间见你。我也不清楚。这是她目前能做的最好的安排，直到她休假，谁知道那会是什么时候。"

"You made time for me, too," she says.  
"你也为我腾出了时间，" 她说。"

"I came because Asuka came. I didn't really think about it." I don't think I should have said that. I watch the glow on Hikari's face flicker, and know I shouldn't have. "I don't mind being here if you don't mind."  
"我来是因为明日香来了。我并没有多想。" 我不该这么说的。我看着光脸上的光芒闪烁，知道我不该说。"如果你不介意，我也不介意待在这里。"

"Nagoya isn't exactly down the street."  
"名古屋可不就在街对面。"

"It's for our jobs." "这是为了我们的工作。"

"You can do better than that," Hikari says, chuckling. "Elaborate for me, Shinji? You make it sound like partnering. I love partnering. I eat it up! Is it a conference? The Nagoya Economic Geography and Graphic Design Conference in Tokyo-3?"  
"你还能做得更好，" 光笑着说，"详细点说，真嗣？你这听起来像是在合作。我喜欢合作。我对此乐此不疲！是会议吗？东京-3 的名古屋经济地理与图形设计会议？"

"Acoustic Design." "声学设计。"

"They don't teach lying at the Nagoya School of Acoustic Design, do they?"  
"名古屋声学设计学院可没教人撒谎，对吧？"

"Hikari-" "光-"-

"Or fair exchange of information?"  
"还是公平交换信息？"

"It's for our old jobs." The glow's gone. Now Hikari's just staring at me. Right above my line of sight, at my mind, before she drags her eyes down to my own. "I didn't want to say anything – I don't want to get you into trouble. It's not paper work. It's not a mission, either. It's the end, I hope it is, and that's all that really matters."  
"这是为了我们以前的工作。" 光芒消失了。现在光只是盯着我。就在我的视线之上，直视我的心灵，然后她才将目光移到我的眼睛上。"我不想说任何话——我不想让你陷入麻烦。这不是文书工作。也不是任务。我希望这是终点，这才是真正重要的。"

Hikari swallows. It at least goes down in her smooth enough that she doesn't change her face anymore. She's a good citizen of Old Tokyo-3. She's Code 707 – we're talking one of its class representatives. She's one of us. She will never pay for anything I ever tell her with more than a frown.  
光吞咽了一下。至少这液体在她喉咙里滑得足够顺畅，她没有再改变表情。她是旧东京-3 的模范公民。她是代码 707——我们说的是它的班级代表之一。她是我们的同伴。她永远不会因为我说的话而付出超过皱眉的代价。

"Tell Ayanami I said hi," she says.  
“告诉绫波我向她问好，”她说。

"I can do that." “我可以做到。”

"Tell her she looks great without all those damn bandages. I know she does."  
"告诉她，没有那些该死的绷带，她看起来棒极了。我知道她会的。"

"I'm sure she does." "我确信她会的。"

"Tell her about Pen-Pen. She liked him, I could tell. Remember her at your little dirty synch session? With Asuka?"  
"跟她聊聊 Pen-Pen 吧。我能看出来她喜欢他。记得你们那次小小的、脏兮兮的同步训练吗？和明日香一起？"

Oh, jeez. "Yeah..." 哦，天哪。“嗯……”

"Tell her we buried him in National Park, inside his fridge, with his steering wheel." I blink, wanting to scratch between my brain and ears. Hikari's the one shaking her head. "The spare wheel he had with him when we adopted him? Always rolled it around with his, uh, little flipper? No? Well, trust me, it was precious."  
“告诉她我们把他埋在国家公园里，就在他的冰箱里，连同他的方向盘。”我眨眼，想挠挠脑袋。光是摇头。“那个备用方向盘，是我们收养他时他带着的？总是用他的，呃，小鳍状肢推着它？不记得了？好吧，相信我，那东西对他很重要。”

"I believe you," I say. Then I remember. "It was Misato's…"  
“我相信你，”我说。然后我想起来了。“那是美里……”

"He had, you know, his collar, his ice box. He had her wheel, but that was it. The first few days after we took him in, we were going to give him right back. All that penguin sick…" Hikari shakes her head, "wasn't natural..."  
"你知道，他有他的衣领，他的冰箱。他有她的轮子，但也就这些了。我们刚把他带回来的头几天，本打算立刻把他送回去。那些企鹅病……" 光摇摇头，"真不正常……"

"Pen-Pen wasn't natural. You should've seen Misato's heating bill."  
"Pen-Pen 不正常。你真该看看美里家的暖气费。"

"You should have seen our dad's heating bill," says Hikari.  
"你该看看我们爸家的暖气费，" 光说。"

"But you kept him and that's what counts." Now I'm thinking about how to get her to stop cocking her head at me. "I'm not saying you didn't have it difficult, but you didn't live in our apartment. You didn't have to see Asuka or Misato there, or, or _talk_ to them. Not like I was any better. We were three different flavors and it, it's just…there wasn't anything…" Nozomi painted a dog on the far opposite wall. I blow at his wet spaghetti torso. "There wasn't anything good left in that place."  
"但你留下了他，这才是关键。" 现在我在想怎么让她别再歪着头看我了。"我不是说你没经历过困难，但你没住过我们的公寓。你没见过明日香或美里在那里，也没跟她们交谈过。我也没好到哪儿去。我们三个就像三种不同的味道，而那地方，就是……没什么……" 望美在对面墙上画了一只狗。我对着他湿漉漉的意大利面身体吹气。"那地方已经没什么好的了。"

"And Asuka feels the same way?" she asks.  
"明日香也是这么想的吗？" 她问道。

"That's something you'd have to ask her."  
"这你得亲自问她。"

"But I did, Shinji. And guess what?" Hikari nods at me, clutching at wrinkled trousers snaking out from under her. "She knows a lot about 'Post-Second Impact Spatial Analysis in the Chūbu Region as related to Tobler's Law'."  
"但我确实做了，真嗣。你猜怎么着？" 光点头示意我，紧抓着从她身下蜿蜒出来的皱巴巴的裤子。"她对‘中部地区后第二次冲击空间分析与托布勒定律的关系’了解颇多。"

"She's only…" I start, but she nods slower, compressing the space between us, stretching it. If I let her gum up my words, she's never going to let me build my nest and sleep. "Look, it's hard for her to come back here. But I think once she's finished what she has to do, she'll be back to see you. She'll visit and it'll be for more than just one day."  
"她只是……" 我开口，但她缓缓点头，压缩了我们之间的距离，又将其拉长。如果我让她堵住我的话，她永远不会让我筑巢安睡。"听着，她很难回到这里。但我想一旦她完成了她必须做的事，她会回来看你的。她会来拜访，而且不仅仅是为了某一天。"

"Is that so?" she asks.  
"是吗？" 她问道。"

"I promise," I say. "我保证，" 我说。

"Let's not go crazy." "别太疯狂了。"

"Alright." "好吧。"

_Alright_. Hikari likes this word enough to mouth it before pushing up off the couch-thing. She catches up to the Hikari Horaki who is horrified by the state of her little sister's room. "I swear, I don't even know how a person gets to have so much stuff."  
好吧。光对这个词情有独钟，甚至先念叨了一遍才从沙发上起身。她追上了被妹妹房间的杂乱吓到的光原佐藤。“我发誓，我真不知道一个人怎么能积攒这么多东西。”

"Stuff is a good thing," I say. She stops her trudge through the art muck so she can look back at me. "No, really. You should only start to worry if you walk in one day and there's nothing in here at all."  
“东西多是好事，”我说。她停下在艺术杂乱中的跋涉，回头看我。“真的。你该担心的只是某天走进来，发现这里空无一物。”

She tries on another oversized smile; what Hikari needs, really, is a mirror. "Let me know when you're back in Nagoya, Shinji."  
她又试了一个过大的微笑；光真正需要的，其实是一面镜子。“真嗣，回名古屋时告诉我一声。”

"Sure." "当然。"

"Goodnight," she tells me. "Let me know."  
"晚安，" 她对我说。"告诉我一声。"

The piñata in Nozomi's room is filled with salsa.  
望月房间里的皮纳塔里装满了莎莎酱。

By 10:30 the next morning, Asuka and I are crossing into downtown on the Yumoto Super Bridge, which is bowed over Mandelbrot Lake. We'd have left Hikari's sooner had I not made such a good case for showering, eating breakfast, and getting dressed. Necessities like those always erode cavities in hard schedules – spaces Hikari and I filled with goodbye.  
到了第二天上午 10:30，我和明日香正穿过湯本超级大桥进入市中心，这座桥横跨在曼德尔布罗特湖上，呈弧形弯曲。要不是我极力主张先洗个澡、吃早餐并换好衣服，我们本可以更早离开光的家。像这些必需品总会侵蚀紧凑日程中的空隙——那些空隙原本被光和我用来道别。

"Hope you didn't forget anything," says Asuka. "It's not like we'll have a chance to go back." In the corner of my eye, she leans forward to loop a small black band around the stem of her ponytail, S.O.P. for Sohryu Getting Shit Done; it just got that much harder to get a word in edgewise.  
“希望你没落下什么东西，”明日香说道，“我们可没机会再回去了。”我眼角余光瞥见她向前倾身，用一根黑色小发圈绕过马尾的根部，这是惣流·认真办事的标准操作；这样一来，想要插话就更难了。

I try to, anyway. "Just how long are you planning on being down here?" I ask.  
尽管如此，我还是尝试着问：“你打算在这里待多久？”

"Longer than it takes to check off my shopping list; not a lot of items with long lead times. Also, we're not committing arson in the cover of broad daylight…" She knifes upright, spring loaded, and studies me. "Oh, please, please tell me you didn't think that was what we were going to do…"  
"比检查我的购物清单还要长；清单上没有太多需要长时间等待的物品。而且，我们不会在光天化日之下纵火……" 她像弹簧一样直起身，盯着我看。"哦，拜托，请告诉我你没以为我们要做那种事……"

I feel my chin dimple as I switch lanes. That gets Asuka to shrug and crane her neck back out. She can see the tops of the skyscrapers, all growing tall and fat on our shrinking distance from them. And I still think of them that way: _Growing_. Ha ha. Some things never change. Or they change so much I marvel at them against my will. "Try to enjoy yourself, Shinji. It looks to be a jungle in there."  
我换车道时感觉到下巴的酒窝。这让明日香耸了耸肩，再次伸长脖子向外看。她能看到摩天大楼的顶端，随着我们与它们距离的缩短，它们显得越来越高耸、越来越庞大。而我仍然这样看待它们：在生长。哈哈。有些事情永远不会改变。或者它们变化如此之大，以至于我不得不惊叹于它们。"试着享受一下，真嗣。那里看起来像是个丛林。"

"I don't think I can kill half a day here," I say.  
"我觉得我没法在这里消磨半天时间，" 我说。

"Not my problem." "不是我的问题。"

"I'm sure there's lots to do, it's that I don't live here anymore and I don't know where to do it."  
"我确信有很多事情要做，只是我已经不住在这里了，不知道该从哪里开始。"

"Well, what do you expect me to do about it?"  
"那你希望我怎么做呢？"

"I don't know. Nothing…" I drum the steering wheel, darting my eyes to the empty CD player in the dash. Run flat tires drone against the asphalt deck. The buzzing shimmies through the wishbone suspension; it vibrates between my toes. "I just think we could've stayed at Hikari's, that's all."  
"我不知道。什么都没有……" 我敲打着方向盘，目光迅速扫过仪表盘上空荡荡的 CD 播放器。防爆轮胎在柏油路面上发出沉闷的嗡嗡声。这种嗡嗡声通过叉骨悬挂系统传递，震颤着我的脚趾。"我只是觉得我们本可以留在光那里，仅此而已。"

"Look," says Asuka. I look at her, nearly killing us both. She explains over the gaggle of car horns, "It's Monday. People work on Monday. They drink their cinnamon dolce lattes on Monday – from their thermoses. They put on their wingtips and their Chelsea boots and their promote-me-pumps on Monday. They drive and take the train and fart on the bus on Monday. They drop off their pee-pants toddlers at daycare on Monday. So Hikari works on Monday."  
"听着，" 明日香说道。我转头看她，差点让我们俩都丧命。她在一片汽车喇叭声中解释道，"今天是星期一。人们星期一要工作。他们星期一喝着肉桂多尔咖啡——从他们的保温瓶里。他们星期一穿上翼尖鞋、切尔西靴和晋升我泵鞋。他们星期一开车、坐火车、在公交车上放屁。他们星期一把穿着尿布的幼儿送到日托所。所以光星期一要工作。"

"And I think it'd be fun to visit her there."  
"而且我觉得去她那里拜访会很有趣。"

"Whatever," says Asuka. “随便啦。”明日香说。

"What? She offered." “什么？她主动提出的。”

"Of course she offered." Asuka throws one leg over the other, bouncing a calf across her knee. "Hikari wouldn't be Hikari if she didn't. She can't help herself. It's sad."  
“她当然会主动提出。”明日香将一条腿搭在另一条上，小腿在膝盖上弹跳着。“如果光不这么做，那她就不是光了。她控制不住自己。真可悲。”

"I don't feel sad for her," I say.  
"我对她并不感到难过，"我说。

"I didn't say you have to," says Asuka.  
"我没说你必须这样，"明日香说。

"Do you have to?" "你一定要这样吗？"

"…Okay." Asuka uncrosses her legs, and claps: she's ending a prayer; she's crushing a fly. "You want me to say she seems content? You want me to say she has it good? Fine. She does and she does. It's Sesame Street awesome, you little muppet. Of course I'm happy for Hikari. Why the hell wouldn't I be? I mean...shit, she's only the best friend I ever had in this huge den of suck. I just didn't think she needed to be entertaining us while little Eiji is throwing down on a macaroni and glue burrito. I just didn't think I needed to carve 'Hikari Is My Friend' into my forehead for you to believe it's true. God forbid that after living in Japan for nine years, I've learned to appreciate what's _not_ being said."  
"“……好吧。” 明日香松开交叠的双腿，拍了拍手：她结束了一场祈祷；她碾碎了一只苍蝇。“你想让我说她看起来很满足？你想让我说她过得很好？行。她确实如此，她确实过得很好。这简直是芝麻街般的精彩，你这个小布偶。我当然为光高兴。我他妈为什么不高兴？我是说……该死，她可是我在这烂透了的狗窝里唯一最好的朋友。我只是没想到她需要在我们面前表演，而小英二却在享用他的通心粉和胶水卷饼。我只是没想到我得在你面前把‘光是我的朋友’刻在额头上，你才会相信这是真的。天哪，千万别让我在日本生活了九年后，才学会欣赏那些未说出口的话。”

I prepare to enjoy myself.  
我准备好好享受一番。

A sign informs us we're five-hundred meters out from city side when Asuka starts to breathe again. She uses her last bit of rocket fuel to whip the air conditioning dial to ON. Cool breath from the dash washes over us as Asuka snaps a glossy leaf of one of her glamour mags. At a hundred meters out, she gasps. "Hey, they have a Paul Stuart here," she says.  
一个标志告诉我们距离市区还有五百米时，明日香开始重新呼吸。她用最后一点火箭燃料般的力量将空调旋钮扭到开启位置。仪表盘吹来的凉风拂过我们，明日香迅速翻过她那本时尚杂志的一页。距离市区一百米时，她倒吸一口气。“嘿，这里有家保罗·斯图亚特，”她说。

---

We parked in a garage that spiraled up like the empty skin of an apple. I didn't ask Asuka where she was going, and she didn't tell me, but she did say that at seven, we'd hook back up at the Tōgendai Music Pavilion on Pier 3. Good deal. Great. After we split up I walked into the first convenience store I saw, plucked a ramen soda from a display cooler, and asked the counter clerk how to find the Tōgendai Music Pavilion on Pier 3. Then I asked her how to find Pier 3.  
我们把车停在一个螺旋上升的停车场，它像一只苹果的空壳。我没问明日香她要去哪儿，她也没告诉我，但她说了，七点钟我们在第三码头的高恩台音乐亭碰头。挺好的。太棒了。分开后，我走进了第一家便利店，从展示柜里拿了一瓶拉面汽水，问收银员怎么去第三码头的高恩台音乐亭。然后我又问她怎么去第三码头。

The pier is a broad, brick-laid finger pointing across the water to the control lock. A tour guide took measured backwards steps behind me while explaining that the lock was engineered to mediate the flow of water between the natural lake and Mandelbrot, the flooded crater the city sits on. I waited for his flock to pass before turning my back on the pier, tethering my memory to it as I hiked down the concrete canyon shading Boulevard One.  
码头宽阔，铺着砖石，像一根手指指向水面上方的控制闸。一位导游在我身后倒退着走，一边解释说这个闸门是为了调节自然湖泊和曼德尔布罗特湖（城市所在的淹没火山口）之间的水流而设计的。我等他的团队过去后，才转身离开码头，沿着遮荫大道一旁的混凝土峡谷走下去，将我的记忆系在那里。

A corner music shop found me four blocks from Ginza-3. An unmanned string quartet loitered on a display podium inside, waiting for someone to give them sound. I ended up playing Gigue from Suite Number Five after letting it slip to the owner I had learned the cello; it's now half past six, and I've finally convinced myself the other patrons weren't clapping because I eventually stopped.  
在银座三丁目以北四个街区的地方，一家角落里的音乐店吸引了我。店内展示台上，一支无人演奏的四重奏弦乐团闲逛着，等待有人赋予它们声音。我最终弹奏了《第五组曲》中的吉格舞曲，因为向店主透露了我曾学过大提琴；现在已是六点半，我终于说服自己，其他顾客并非因为我最终停下来而鼓掌。

Later, lunchtime salary men and kids in colors herded me underground, into a tube train that tunneled over to Ashi Plaza. I was pressed against a high school girl who had worked her hair into a purple carnation. Flickering bees lavished the petals with drunken orbits, programmed into them by the holographic projectors in her permed stamens. A tongue of light flicked out at a bee and reeled it in to the toothless, translucent mouth of a lizard, coded to perch on a boy's shoulder. What I wanted to know was how the builders of the tube system got around the titanium bulkheads layered over the Geofront.  
后来，午餐时间的上班族和穿着各色校服的孩子们将我挤进了地下，进入了一列驶向 Ashi 广场的地铁。我紧贴着一位将头发梳成紫色康乃馨样式的高中女生。闪烁的蜜蜂在花瓣上醉醺醺地盘旋，这是由她烫发中的全息投影仪编程而成的。一道光舌伸出，将一只蜜蜂卷入一只无牙的透明蜥蜴口中，这只蜥蜴被编码为栖息在一个男孩的肩上。我想知道的是，地铁系统的建设者是如何绕过地表上覆盖的钛合金防爆墙的。

I bled lunch out at an okonomiyaki joint, grinding egg and kimchi cud as I looked down on Ashi Plaza from a mezzanine. Asuka might have been at the plaza; specialty stores and boutiques with Italian names encroached on the edges of the square, but I couldn't see her staying after depleting her cash reserves. The fountain at the center of the plaza wasn't her thing; it served no other purpose than to spout discrete missiles of chlorinated water at screaming children and their exhausted mothers. I watched them, knowing Asuka would have commented on how impractical a firing sequence that would be for a SAM turret. And I agreed. And I left.  
我在一家大阪烧店把午饭吐了出来，一边咀嚼着鸡蛋和泡菜的残渣，一边从夹层俯瞰阿什广场。明日香可能就在广场上；那些带有意大利名字的特色商店和精品店侵占了广场的边缘，但我看不出她会在现金耗尽后还逗留于此。广场中央的喷泉并非她的菜；它除了向尖叫的孩子们和疲惫的母亲喷射氯化水柱外，别无他用。我看着他们，心想明日香肯定会评论说这种喷射序列对防空炮塔来说是多么不切实际。我同意她的看法。然后我离开了。

I got my answer about the titanium bulkheads a few hours later: water jets, escorted on wide-load rigs into a construction site on Boulevard Three. The jet planted stout, telescoping legs beneath the armor plating exposed in the foundation walls before extending an elongated head over the bulkhead. It was a giant electric cake mixer until an operator hit a switch and the thing sang ribbons of metal off the whole, which after an hour was anything but.  
几个小时后，我对钛合金防爆墙的疑问得到了解答：水刀，在宽载卡车的护送下进入三号大道的一个建筑工地。水刀在暴露于地基墙的装甲板下植入坚固的伸缩腿，然后延伸出一个细长的头部覆盖在防爆墙上。它就像一个巨大的电动蛋糕搅拌器，直到操作员按下开关，这东西才开始唱起金属丝带之歌，一小时后，它已面目全非。

I wondered which of the twenty-two layers they were cutting, and how tall the building would be for the footprint the workers had dug. If they had to dig any deeper. I wondered if the workers knew that if the building was tall enough and wide enough, they'd dig themselves to the start of the world. They probably weren't paid to dig that far.  
我好奇他们正在切割的是二十二层中的哪一层，以及这座建筑会因为工人们挖掘的地基而有多高。如果他们需要挖得更深的话。我想知道工人们是否知道，如果建筑足够高、足够宽，他们就会挖到世界起点。他们大概不会被付钱挖那么远。

I watched the buildings on the walk back to Pier 3; their faces, glimmering mirrors reflecting yellows and oranges at their zeniths; their pillars, rooted in the bedrock like industrial oaks; every last one a teacher's pet, raising antennae and signs higher and straighter than the last, brimming with answers to questions I've been too afraid to ask.  
在走回三号码头的路上，我看着那些建筑；它们的立面，闪烁的镜面反射着顶端的黄色和橙色；它们的柱子，像工业橡树一样扎根在基岩上；每一个都是老师的宠儿，竖起天线和标志，比上一个更高更直，充满了我不敢问的问题的答案。

Since I'd left Tōgendai in the morning, it had absorbed a load of tourists and off-the-clock citizens, soaking in hibachi smoke or the Creole North music scene. I sat on a toadstool of a mooring pillar for about two seconds before a jazz quartet veered into their set further down the pier. I tried ignoring it, I did, but a bend in the song's pitch looped under me, began carrying me off to the temporary stage the band plucked and strummed and blared from.  
自从早上离开东仙台以来，那里已经吸收了一大批游客和下班的市民，沉浸在日式烧烤烟雾或克里奥尔北音乐场景中。我在一个像蘑菇一样的系泊柱上坐了大约两秒钟，然后一个爵士四重奏在码头更远的地方开始了他们的演奏。我试图忽视它，我真的尝试了，但歌曲的音调弯曲让我脚下生风，开始把我带到乐队弹拨、弹奏和吹奏的临时舞台上。

Then, way across the water, I spied the control lock bracing the edge of Mandelbrot Lake. I noticed its interlaced hands of steel, meditating in the rim of blasted rock, holding back new ruin with quiet ease. I sat back down, and smiled.  
然后，远远地跨过水面，我瞥见了控制锁紧贴着曼德尔布罗特湖的边缘。我注意到它那交织的钢铁之手，在炸裂的岩石边缘冥想，以平静的从容阻挡着新的毁灭。我坐回原处，微笑了。

My walk was over. 我的散步结束了。

---

There's a crumple of paper as Asuka sideswipes me with one or eight of her bags. "So the biggest, dumbest stooge got hitched, eh? Some Setsuko chick."  
一张纸被揉皱的声音，明日香用她的一个或几个袋子侧面撞了我一下。“所以，最大的笨蛋傻瓜结婚了，嗯？那个叫雪子的小妞。”

"I guess so," I say, scooting back onto the mooring pillar. The concert's over. The crowd crumbles into chattering cliques that drift past me and Asuka.  
"我想是的，" 我边说边挪回到系船柱上。音乐会结束了。人群散成叽叽喳喳的小团体，从我和明日香身边飘然而过。

"You 'guess'? You and Hikari had more than enough time to talk behind my back while I was getting washed up last night."  
"你'猜'？昨晚我洗漱的时候，你和光已经足够时间在我背后聊个够了。"

"What's that mean?" She tilts her chin down at me, eyebrows aloft. "Asuka, we just shot the breeze."  
"那是什么意思？" 她下巴微倾，眉头一挑。"明日香，我们只是闲聊了几句。"

"Fine, don't talk about it," she huffs. "I really don't care."  
“好吧，不谈这个了，”她气呼呼地说，“我真的不在乎。”

"I haven't put that much thought to it, that's all. It is what it is."  
“我还没怎么细想，就这样。事情就是它本来的样子。”

Asuka frowns. Her cheeks puff up to pouting, then deflate. She's too content to nurture the argument. Or too hungry. She's okay with the first food tent we come to further down the pier. Dinner is a fried pork cutlet sweating grease on a paper plate. She finishes eating and sucks down half of her ginger ale before she finally takes issue with something. "I would've told you about the free shuttle coming back this way if I knew you were going to get this sweaty," she tells me. "Look at you."  
明日香皱起眉头。她的脸颊鼓起来又瘪下去，显得有些生气，但很快又因为满足或饥饿而消气了。她对我们在码头上遇到的第一个小吃摊感到满意。晚餐是一块炸猪排，油腻腻地躺在纸盘上。她吃完后，喝了一大半的姜汁汽水，终于对某件事提出了异议。“如果我知道你会弄得这么汗流浃背，我就会告诉你有免费班车回来的，”她对我说，“看看你。”

"I'll dry off." But she doesn't wait, plucking some napkins from a back pocket and wiping my face.  
"我会擦干的。" 但她不等我，从后口袋抽出几张餐巾纸，开始擦拭我的脸。

"Stop squirming…" From a drawstring bag she conjures a camera – a high end, silver slip that stares at me with its huge unblinking eye. She scoots closer to me, holding the shutter at arm's length. I mutter. No matter how much I iron my face out, I'll still come out looking like a drunken llama, I just know it. Click.  
"别乱动……" 她从束口袋里变出一只相机——高端银色机身，用它那巨大的、不眨眼的镜头盯着我。她挪近我，伸直手臂按下快门。我咕哝着。无论我怎么努力摆正表情，拍出来的肯定还是一副醉醺醺的羊驼样，我心里有数。咔嚓。

"It's not even that humid," I say.  
"天气也没那么潮湿，" 我说。

"I know – it's kind of a skin thing." Asuka's thumbing a tab on the camera's backside. Her fingers, her hands, the arms tensioned into her sleeveless top; dry to the surgically-repaired bone. "I didn't feel like waiting."  
"我知道——这有点像是皮肤问题。" 明日香正用拇指按着相机背面的一个标签。她的手指，她的手，手臂紧绷在她无袖上衣里；干燥到手术修复的骨头。"我不想等。"

"What's the rush?" I ask. "I thought we could walk down to Pier 2. The tour guide, he was saying there's an exhibit there. About all the new buildings, the bridges, everything." Asuka shrugs one shoulder like she has a nerve condition. "Well, what about the machines they used to dredge ground zero when they started rebuilding?"  
"急什么呢？" 我问。"我以为我们可以走到二号码头。导游说那里有个展览。关于所有新建筑，桥梁，一切。" 明日香耸了耸一个肩膀，好像她有神经疾病。"那么，他们开始重建时用来挖掘零地的那些机器呢？"

"What about them?" "那些机器怎么了？"

I tell her what the guide said: that back then all the excavators in the region had been dedicated to the Old Tokyo Reclamation Project. The project didn't get very far off the ground, but it wasn't like anyone knew that at the time. The Tokyo-3 planning board ended up having to improvise. Somehow or another, they came into about a dozen huge impellers, like for a ridiculously large submarine. The engineers in charge of the dredging had the impellers modified as suction excavators – giant silt vacuums.  
我告诉她导游的话：那时候，这一带所有的挖掘机都投入到了旧东京复垦项目中。这个项目并没有取得多大进展，但当时没人知道这一点。东京-3 规划委员会最终不得不临时变通。不知怎么的，他们得到了大约一打巨大的螺旋桨，就像是为一个荒谬巨大的潜艇准备的。负责疏浚的工程师将这些螺旋桨改装成了吸力挖掘机——巨大的淤泥吸尘器。

"You don't say," she musters around her last sip of soda.  
"你不说我也知道，"她喝完最后一口汽水，勉强说道。

"No…" The camera goes down to her lap. Her eyes come up. "I think that's all the guide knows. Check out a picture of one of those impellers. Remember the diving suit they stuffed Unit-02 in? The propulsion rig for the suit? That's what those impellers were for. Asuka, they retrofitted your D-Type equipment to dredge the crater. To make this place."  
"不……"镜头转向她的膝盖。她的目光抬起。"我想这就是导游所知道的一切了。看看那些螺旋桨的照片。还记得他们把二号机塞进去的那套潜水服吗？潜水服的推进装置？那些螺旋桨就是为那个设计的。明日香，他们将你的 D 型设备改装来挖掘这个弹坑。为了建造这个地方。

"How…" She flicks her wrist. The cup topples end over into the nearest receptacle, "industrious."  
“怎…”她手腕一抖，杯子翻滚着落入最近的容器，“么这么勤快。”

I open my mouth. She nods at the red brick walkway. The camera rises. It chirps and whirs beneath her magic fingers. She pauses to adjust her ponytail. She nods at the red brick walkway. I close my mouth.  
我张开嘴。她朝红砖小径点点头。摄像机在她魔术般的手指下升起。它发出啁啾和嗡鸣声。她停下来调整马尾辫。她再次朝红砖小径点点头。我闭上了嘴。

For the first time, I notice the water craft sprinkled on the lake: water taxis, tour cruisers, yachts or paddle boats. They're all rice grains from this distance, too far away for me to hear them churn or chug, or to hear them grunt from the buildup of lactic acid in their thighs. What I hear are the waves chomping on the slate pier walls below us, warning me and Asuka further inland. To the garage. To the car. The sound must be louder to Asuka, because she takes heed. And I follow.  
第一次，我注意到湖面上点缀着各种水上交通工具：水上出租车、观光游轮、游艇或脚踏船。从这里看去，它们都像是远处的米粒，太远了，我听不见它们的轰鸣或突突声，也听不见他们因大腿乳酸堆积而发出的喘息。我能听到的是波浪啃噬着我们下方石板码头的墙壁，警告我和明日香向内陆更深处前进。去车库。去车上。这声音对明日香来说一定更响，因为她注意到了。而我紧随其后。

---

We stop for gas. 我们停下来加油。

---

My problem isn't that it's midnight, or that Asuka and I are on the wrong side of the tracks. In Tokyo-3, there is no wrong side of the tracks. The city's houses, its schools, train stations and shopping malls – even if you're talking places that were around to have survived the explosion of Unit-00 – are about twenty years young or less.  
我的问题不在于现在是午夜，也不在于我和明日香身处错误的街区。在第三新东京市，没有所谓的错误街区。这座城市的房屋、学校、火车站和购物中心——即使你提到的是那些在零号机爆炸中幸存下来的地方——都不过二十年的历史。

Think of a bee hive. Just do that. Its workers, its soldiers. Think of the straight line it draws between function and design. Scale it up. Make it metal. Give it missiles. The oldest parts of the city, like where our old apartment slumps? They're function with rainbow decals slapped onto their smooth edges – those arcades, those laundromats, those empty backyards with receding grasslines. One day, Old Town-3 will forget its honeycomb chassis.  
想象一个蜂巢。就这么想象。它的工蜂，它的战士。思考它如何在功能与设计之间划出一条直线。将其放大。变成金属。装上导弹。城市中最古老的部分，比如我们旧公寓所在的地方？它们是功能性的，只是在光滑的边缘贴上了彩虹贴纸——那些拱廊，那些自助洗衣店，那些草坪逐渐后退的空旷后院。总有一天，旧城区会忘记它的蜂窝结构。

My problem is that I know what these old neighborhood modules supported. My problem is that I am Old Town-3. My problem is that I'm pulling up to the side of my old compartment with my old comrade, and my other comrades are not here and they never will be.  
我的问题是，我知道这些老街区模块所支撑的一切。我的问题是，我是老镇-3。我的问题是，我正与我的老战友一起驶向我旧居的一侧，而我的其他战友们不在这里，他们永远不会再回来了。

---

I'll tell Asuka all her bags are missing from the trunk as soon as she puts down the bolt cutters. She doesn't need the cutters, anyway; the fence between us and the apartment complex has a hole in it. Asuka stuffs the shears into her backpack and crouches beneath the dead, chain link skin curled back on itself. I scuttle through after her, lugging my gas can with a hunchback gait. We're taking a side entrance, through an emergency exit door clinging to its top hinge. The distance from the fence to the side is shorter than the distance to the front, but we still have a good sixty meters. I can't help looking back.  
我会告诉明日香她的所有行李都不见了，只要她放下那把断线钳。反正她也不需要那把钳子；我们和公寓楼之间的栅栏上有个洞。明日香把剪线钳塞进背包，蹲下穿过那片死气沉沉、被铁丝网卷曲覆盖的区域。我驼着背，拖着油桶跟在她后面。我们正通过一扇仅靠上铰链挂着的紧急出口门，走侧门进入。从栅栏到侧门的距离比到正门短，但我们仍有六十多米的距离。我不禁回头望去。

Now I'm glad we rented a black car; I know it's there only by the sliver of night light tracing its roof. There's no moon out tonight. All the light poles here hang their dark heads at being taken off the grid. But every little bit of stealth helps, on the off chance someone stumbles by. There were never any clubs or convenience stores near the apartment to draw people, soused, rowdy, what have you. And if there had been any establishments, Misato couldn't have supported them all on her own. She couldn't have…Nah.  
现在我庆幸我们租了一辆黑色轿车；我只能通过一丝夜光勾勒出的车顶轮廓来辨认它。今晚没有月亮。这里的所有路灯都垂头丧气，因为被断电了。但每一点隐秘都有帮助，以防万一有人偶然经过。公寓附近从未有过任何俱乐部或便利店吸引人群，无论是醉酒的、喧闹的，还是其他什么。即便有这些场所，美里也无法独自支撑。她无法……算了吧。

Sure, Misato claimed her share of watering holes – dives in sister neighborhoods – but more often she brought the bar back home; the only time she'd nurse a Yebisu would be when draped over her veranda to look down at the city, as I'm looking now from the complex courtyard. I never found the courage to ask Misato what she thought as she stared and drank, or what she felt. Tokyo-3 was a different animal back then – not even an animal, not with all those oiled, grinding parts. But I hope she felt warmer up here than I do–  
当然，美里也有她常去的酒吧——邻近社区的那些小酒馆——但更多时候她会把酒吧带回家；唯一一次她会慢慢品尝惠比寿啤酒，是在她倚靠在阳台上俯瞰城市的时候，就像我现在从综合庭院里眺望一样。我从未鼓起勇气问美里，当她凝视着喝酒时在想什么，或是感受到什么。那时的东京-3 是个截然不同的存在——甚至算不上一个生物，而是由那些润滑良好、相互咬合的部件构成。但我希望她在这里感觉比我现在更温暖——

"Hey." “嘿。”

Some bony part of Asuka catches my shoulder. "Watch where you're going," she hisses. "If you spill that gas on me…" She doesn't bother finishing. I don't want her to. Her ponytail swishes into the blackness of the stairwell. I think she snaps her fingers until the concrete risers turn in on themselves and upward in a wandering spotlight. Asuka turns her little piece of sun flare right into my eye. "Where's your torch, man?"  
某个尖锐的部位从明日香那里戳到了我的肩膀。“看路啊，”她低声呵斥，“要是把那汽油泼到我身上……”她没说完，我也不想让她说完。她的马尾辫甩进了楼梯间的黑暗中。我想她是在打响指，直到混凝土台阶在游移的聚光灯下扭曲并向上延伸。明日香将她那束阳光般的闪光直接照进了我的眼睛。“你的手电筒呢，伙计？”

Asuka's halfway up the second flight by the time I snap on my own flashlight. I slosh up after her, ticking off floors when I can't make out the numbered signs at each landing. I'm skirting by the exit doors not already resting on the ground, or missing. Shining my light beyond the door frames, I see into the inner apartment ring, where the empty wait to be filled. "It seems like a waste, you know? All these people moving back here, and they're tearing this place down," I say.  
当我打开自己的手电筒时，明日香已经爬到了第二段楼梯的一半。我踉跄地跟在她后面，尽力辨认着每一层楼的编号标志。我绕过那些没有倒在地上或缺失的出口门。用手电筒照向门框之外，我窥视着内部公寓环，那里空荡荡地等待着被填满。“你知道吗？这看起来像是一种浪费，所有这些人搬回来，他们却在拆毁这个地方，”我说。

"By here, you mean, what, the city?" I only hear her echo down to me, and her low-cut boots turning in the grit. But she knows I'm nodding. "Why would you stay in a place where you have nowhere to buy food or have fun? Think a sec, Shinji, there's nothing around here to keep anyone rooted."  
“你说的这里，是指什么，城市吗？”我只听到她的回声传到我这里，还有她低帮靴在沙砾中转动的声音。但她知道我在点头。“在一个无处买食物或娱乐的地方，你为什么要留下？想一想，真嗣，这里没有任何东西能让人扎根。”

"It wouldn't stay like that forever," I answer.  
"它不会永远这样下去的，" 我回答道。

"But who the hell would want to wait?"  
"但谁他妈愿意等呢？"

"It's just…a waste…" Asuka doesn't respond this time. She's satisfied with being a floor above me, taking two steps at a time, wheeling further up with each scratch in the dust.  
"这只不过是……一种浪费……" 明日香这次没有回应。她满足于在我上方一层楼，每次都跨两级台阶，随着每道尘土中的划痕越走越远。

I lurch out onto the twelfth floor atrium, spotlighting the door at the end of the hall; Asuka's already crouched by **M. KATSURAGI**, hefting a small science experiment from her bag. I think it's supposed to be a magnetic reader, or whatever's needed to actually break into an apartment with an electric front door. Then I think something else as I set the gas can down. "Wait a minute… if there's no power running to the building, how are you going to open the door?"  
我踉跄着走到十二楼的门厅，聚光灯照亮了走廊尽头的那扇门；明日香已经蹲在 M.葛城旁边，从包里拿出一个小型科学实验装置。我想那应该是个磁性读取器，或者是用来破解电子前门的任何所需设备。然后我放下汽油罐，突然想到一个问题。“等等……如果大楼没有电力供应，你怎么打开门？”

"Think life safety," she says. "The doors have to have emergency batteries, in case the juice goes out." She stops playing with the device to swat me in my shin. "Quit standing over me."  
“想想生命安全，”她说，“门必须有应急电池，以防断电。”她停下手中的操作，拍了一下我的小腿。“别站在我上面。”

"You really think the batteries still work after eight years?"  
“你真的认为电池在八年之后还能工作吗？”

"Have to, completely deenergized doors fail open."Asuka stands up, over her upturned torch. Her shadow moves across the ceiling like a thunderhead. "There's always manual, Shinji. Just like old times. Didn't think I'd find out about all those push-ups you've been doing, did you?"  
"必须得，完全断电的门会自动打开。"明日香站起身，越过她翻倒的火把。她的影子在天花板上移动，宛如一片雷雨云。"总有手动的方法，真嗣。就像过去一样。没想到我会发现你一直在做的那些俯卧撑，对吧？"

"But there's no crank shaft for this door."  
"但这扇门没有曲柄轴。"

"Then I guess you can go back to the car and wait for me," she says.  
"那我想你可以回车里等我了，"她说道。"

"I guess I could." "我想我可以。"

I don't think I said that in a way that would catch her attention. But her breath snags. All the ticks and twitches that mark Asuka, she stops them. "And then you can call your boy. I know Hikari gave you his number, too."  
我不认为我那样说会吸引她的注意。但她的呼吸一滞。所有标志着明日香的小动作，她都停了下来。“然后你可以给你的男孩打电话。我知道光也给了你他的号码。”

"Asuka, she was doing do me a fav –"  
“明日香，她是在帮我个忙——”

I start backing up to the door when I can smell the mint gum on her breath.  
我一边后退向门口，一边能闻到她呼吸中的薄荷味口香糖。

"Or just go back to her place," she breathes. "Why don't you open _her_ door? She's been off work for hours, now, hasn't she? You can do each other favors. You can shoot the breeze. For all you know you're one washed bowl or steamed curtain away from getting more of her pie."  
“或者直接回她家，”她轻声说，“你为什么不打开她的门呢？她已经下班好几个小时了，不是吗？你们可以互相帮忙。可以闲聊几句。天知道你离再吃到她的派只差一个洗过的碗或一条蒸过的窗帘。”

My tongue fumbles the words that would make Asuka small and silly. Until I recover them, I'm reeling. It doesn't help that the door swooshes open and I topple back over the threshold, cutting myself on the rusting jamb. I turn my flashlight on my left palm; it makes so much sense that the grime and blood comingle just above the nexus of pain.  
我的舌头笨拙地吐不出能让明日香显得渺小和愚蠢的词句。直到我找回它们，我仍感到晕眩。更糟糕的是，门呼地一声开了，我踉跄着退过门槛，被生锈的门框划伤。我打开手电照向左手掌；污垢与血迹在痛感交汇处混杂，这一切显得如此合理。

"What did you do?" Asuka asks.  
"你做了什么？" 明日香问道。

"What did _you_ do?" "你做了什么？"

Now that we've cleared that up, Asuka steps through, the puppy eyes she makes at her strip reader saying it all: weeks of reading, web surfing, coding, and blackmailing, wasted.  
既然我们已经澄清了这一点，明日香走了进来，她对着她的条码阅读器做出的狗狗眼表情说明了一切：几周的阅读、上网、编码和敲诈勒索，都白费了。

Then she smiles. 然后她微笑了。

We gather our things from outside, setting them on the bare dining room floor. Asuka's stuffed an epic in her backpack: gloves, goggles, a fire-retardant blanket, petroleum jelly, wool socks, scissors, two cans of Diet Pepsi. Good Lord, _Pepsi_. The parade doesn't end until the bag regurgitates a larger lamp, which she sits on the floor, lens side up. Asuka switches on the lamp, and we start.  
我们从外面收拾好东西，放在空荡荡的餐厅地板上。明日香在背包里塞了一本史诗级装备：手套、护目镜、防火毯、凡士林、羊毛袜、剪刀、两罐无糖百事可乐。天哪，百事可乐。直到背包吐出一个更大的灯，这场展示才算结束，她把灯放在地板上，镜头朝上。明日香打开灯，我们开始了。

She starts, hauling a gas can off to Misato's room. I stay at the kitchen's edge, peering across the threshold into the living room, seeing all the way to the sliding glass door of the veranda without so much as a cockroach to cast shadows in between. Whoever's sitting in Misato's chairs, or farting on her pillows, or setting food on her coffee table, or watching her T.V., I hope they're enjoying themselves. I hope they choke.  
她开始行动，拎着一桶汽油走向美里小姐的房间。我留在厨房边缘，透过门槛望向客厅，一直能看到阳台的滑动玻璃门，中间连一只蟑螂投下阴影都没有。无论是谁坐在美里小姐的椅子上，或是对着她的枕头放屁，还是在她的咖啡桌上放食物，或是看她的电视，我希望他们玩得开心。我希望他们噎住。

My nails have been stoking the dull ache in my palm, and the pain flares brilliantly. That can't be good: I'm wearing a tee, white except for the hex patterns running up to the armpits; I might leave bloody fingerprints on outside walls and handrails; I could get petrol in my wound should I ever get it in me to douse the kitchen counter. None of this is good.  
我的指甲一直在摩挲手掌中隐隐的痛感，疼痛猛然剧烈起来。这可不妙：我穿着一件 T 恤，除了腋下向上延伸的六角形图案外，其余部分都是白色的；我可能会在外墙和扶手上留下血指纹；万一我有胆量往厨房台面上泼汽油，伤口可能会沾上汽油。这些都不妙。

I need to wash my hands. Dumbfounded, the washroom faucet sputters hard water into my palms. I dry my hands on napkins as a cold heat diffuses out from my spine. The chill smolders on the roof of my mouth by the time I'm back at the living room. Asuka's there, shaking the last drops from the first can onto the center of the floor – I won't have to yell. "Water's still on."  
我需要洗手。卫生间的水龙头喷出硬水，我愣愣地看着水流进手掌。我用纸巾擦干手，一股冷热交织的感觉从脊椎扩散开来。回到客厅时，寒意已在口腔上颚闷烧。明日香在那里，将第一罐的最后几滴液体摇到地板中央——我无需大喊。“水还在流。”

"Super," she says, her back turned on me. "I gotta get this shit off of my boots. It'll take some doing to set this off without blowing myself up."  
“太好了，”她背对着我说，“我得把这玩意儿从靴子上弄掉。要引爆这东西而不把自己炸飞，可得费点功夫。”

"Why is it still on? If there's no power…"  
“为什么它还在运转？如果没有电的话……”

"The pumps are far enough away to still be on the grid?" The empty can falls off her fingers, hits the carpet like a footfall in a swamp marsh. "Busted valve seat? The rise and disturbing prevalence of public works negligence in a country of historically supreme work ethic? Take your pick."  
“水泵离得够远，还能接上电网？”空罐子从她指间滑落，砸在毯子上，像沼泽地里的一声脚步。“阀座坏了？在一个以历史最高工作道德著称的国家，公共工程疏忽的上升和普遍令人不安？随便你选。”

Asuka ambles over to scoop up the other gas can and scoff at me; it's so her to confuse acquiescence with fear.  
明日香慢悠悠地走过去捡起另一个汽油罐，对我嗤之以鼻；她总是把顺从误认为是恐惧。

"Jesus, we're not going to get caught. The building never had sprinklers in the first place and the fire alarm panel is disconnected." I duck my head into the living room to see Asuka trundle down the hall, and the vapor drift almost sends me the rest of the way down. A step and a half from my room, she raps her knuckles on the naked drywall. "I'm not even sure if these walls are fire-rated. It's a small miracle they even let us stay in this death trap."  
"天哪，我们不会被抓到的。这栋楼本来就没有喷淋系统，火警控制面板也被断开了。" 我探头望向客厅，看到明日香沿着走廊蹒跚走来，那股蒸汽差点让我整个人都飘起来。离我的房间还有一步半的距离，她用指关节敲了敲裸露的石膏板。"我甚至不确定这些墙是否防火。能让我们住在这死亡陷阱里简直是奇迹。"

"How come you know all this crap?" I ask between gulps of saliva, reminding myself I didn't just siphon five liters of gasoline. I'm doing that a lot.  
"你怎么知道这些乱七八糟的东西？" 我一边吞咽着唾液一边问道，提醒自己并没有刚刚抽取五升汽油。我最近经常这么做。"

"How does the sparrow know to land on the third blue roof? You have your crap-gathering networks," says Asuka, "and I have mine." I'd beg to differ – I keep connections as well as a pair of scissors in a string factory – but she's already facing my shoji, sliding it open. Peering in. Sliding it closed. "Now, let's see what you're made of, Shinji."  
"麻雀为何知道落在第三个蓝色屋顶上？你有你的情报网，" 明日香说，"我也有我的。" 我本想反驳——我的关系网不亚于在绳索工厂里的一把剪刀——但她已经面对着我的屏风，将其拉开。探头进去。又将其合上。"现在，让我们看看你到底是什么材料，真嗣。"

I blink. Asuka's built herself sturdy – arms crossed, feet planted in the stain guard carpet. The gas can sits obediently beneath the shapely wickets of his master. Her half-smile cures in the anemic light; now she can stare hard at me without blinking back. She's not blinking. "Asuka, I don't...I just want this to be over…"  
我眨了眨眼。明日香把自己打造得坚实——双臂交叉，双脚稳稳地站在防污地毯上。汽油桶温顺地躺在她那优雅的胯下。她的半笑在苍白的光线下显得有些僵硬；现在她可以直勾勾地盯着我，不再眨眼。她没有眨眼。“明日香，我不……我只是希望这一切结束……”

"I just want you to do your part," she tells me.  
“我只是希望你尽你的本分，”她对我说。

I can't look at her. I'm hard pressed to look at anything in here. No table leg to tether myself to, no SDAT to drown myself in sound with, no chair to sit in to play the cello I don't have. Not enough to keep my eyes from floating out to where Tokyo-3 grows tall, digs deep, runs hot. The very tops of the city peek over the veranda and wink at me in the dark with a dozen ruby eyes. I appreciate that this place will be far hotter than anything down on the lake if I stick around – just not as much as Asuka might. "I'll make sure you get to your lecture on time tomorrow."  
我无法直视她。在这里，我很难看向任何东西。没有桌腿可以让我依靠，没有 SDAT 来用声音淹没自己，没有椅子可以坐下来演奏我没有的大提琴。不足以让我的视线不飘向东京-3 那高耸、深挖、炽热的地方。城市的最高点在阳台外窥视，在黑暗中用十几只红宝石般的眼睛向我眨眼。我明白，如果我留在这里，这个地方会比湖边任何地方都热得多——只是不如明日香可能感受到的那么多。“我会确保你明天准时去上课。”

I walk back out through the kitchen, knowing she'll slump me like a sack of wet rice before I reach the foyer. But she doesn't. I suppose she's saving up for the ride back to Nagoya, when I and her tongue are localized. She'll at least opt for a place where the air won't slick her throat. So for now, Asuka holds back the flood. And I get to stagger out the front door with my fealty unquestioned. Thank God for small miracles.  
我穿过厨房走回去，知道她会在我到达门厅前像对付一袋湿米一样把我撂倒。但她没有。我想她是在为回名古屋的路上攒劲，那时我和她的舌头都得集中精力。她至少会选择一个空气不会让她喉咙发滑的地方。所以现在，明日香忍住了洪流。而我得以带着未受质疑的忠诚蹒跚走出前门。感谢上帝赐予的小小奇迹。

Very small. 非常小。

---

I put the car in drive and glide away from the building. Our old place is nested on a top floor, where the verandas slope back from the street, but I can see that one corner up high glows, a morsel of sun trapped inside it. I don't think Asuka looks; she's uniquely qualified at staring at her lap and kneading out all the lumps in her backpack.  
我挂上档，驾车离开了那栋楼。我们的旧居位于顶层，阳台从街道向后倾斜，但我能看到高处的一角在发光，一缕阳光被困在其中。我不认为明日香在看；她特别擅长盯着膝盖，同时揉平背包里的所有疙瘩。

"Your bags are gone." "你的行李不见了。"

"Old intel," she says. She moves again, clutching something she pulled out of her pack and spooling it around her hand. "No telling how they would've burned, anyway."  
"过时的情报，""她说道。她再次移动，紧握着从背包里掏出的某样东西，缠绕在手上。""反正也不知道它们会怎么烧掉。"

"Like bags full of expensive clothes, if I had to guess."  
"就像装满昂贵衣服的袋子，如果我得猜的话。"

"You don't have to guess." After I make a left turn, her fingers pry mine off the wheel, waltz on my left palm, and give the cut a cool, liquid bee sting that dulls the ache. She wipes the alcohol from my hand with her thumb. "You don't have to do anything."  
"你不必猜测。" 在我左转之后，她的手指掰开我握着方向盘的手，在我的左手掌上轻舞，给伤口带来一阵清凉的液体蜂蜇般的刺痛，缓解了疼痛。她用拇指擦去我手上的酒精。"你什么都不必做。"

A straight shot for a few blocks. The neighborhood evolves up ahead, with street lamps spouting dunce caps of light onto either side of the road. I can look at Asuka, now. I do, but her eyes are watching her hands fold a wad of gauze over the wound. "You couldn't have expected me to help you," I say. She's three silent laps around my hand. "What should I have done? What were you waiting for me to do?"  
几个街区直行。前方社区逐渐变化，路灯在道路两侧投下愚人帽般的光晕。现在我可以看向明日香了。我确实看了，但她的眼睛正盯着她将一团纱布折叠覆盖在伤口上的手。"你不可能指望我帮你，"我说。她在我手上默默缠了三圈。"我应该怎么做？你在等我做什么？"

"God, Shinji, that's up to me? If it makes you feel any better, I saved your room for last and ran out of fuel before I got back to it."  
"天啊，真嗣，这取决于我吗？如果这能让你感觉好些，我最后才收拾你的房间，但在回去之前燃料就用完了。"

"Not really." "不是真的。"

"I said, 'if'." Asuka squeezes; my knuckles huddle up like marbles. "Relax. It's over now, just like you wanted. Put in that CD you like, and relax, okay? It was just a place."  
"我说的是‘如果’。" 明日香紧握着；我的指关节像弹珠一样蜷缩起来。"放松。现在一切都结束了，就像你希望的那样。放上你喜欢的 CD，放松一下，好吗？那只是一个地方。"

"If it was just a place, then why the hell did you have to burn it down? Why did you burn down our home?"  
"如果那只是一个地方，那你为什么要把它烧掉？为什么要烧掉我们的家？"

The binding constricts and settles. She's finished. "It wasn't my home."  
束缚收紧并安定下来。她完成了。“那不是我的家。”

The tires scream. Asuka shouts. The backpack leaps from her lap and mauls the dashboard. Dread lurches into my forebrain, shatters, splashes inside my skull. Our haunches rise and are slammed back into our seats. The universe levels off, so I know it's me that Asuka's gaping at.  
轮胎尖叫。明日香大喊。背包从她膝上跳起，猛击仪表盘。恐惧涌入我的前额，破碎，溅洒在我的头颅内。我们的臀部抬起，又被重重摔回座椅。宇宙恢复平衡，所以我明白明日香正瞪着我。

My foot comes off the brake.  
我的脚离开了刹车。

Trickling, down through my chest, pooling in my lungs – a simmering cauldron. I churn out a shaky breath and look at the bandage around my hand. Asuka wrapped it in enough gauze so that the blood won't show through.  
涓涓细流，从胸口缓缓流下，汇聚在肺部——一锅沸腾的汤。我呼出一口颤抖的气息，看着缠在手上的绷带。明日香用足够的纱布包扎，以免血迹透出来。

"What the fuck are you smoking?" There's a core of mirth to her words. Asuka doesn't look mad either, but her lopsided grin threatens to slough off, a sticker with faulty backing. She could have a gun pressed to her back for all I know. Asuka should have rifled through the pictures she took today, studied the smile she saddled next to my llama-face on Pier 3. I wait until she's having trouble tent-poling the façade, right before her flush cheeks fall…  
“你他妈在抽什么风？”她的话语中带着一丝戏谑。明日香看起来并不生气，但她那歪斜的笑容似乎随时会脱落，就像一张背胶失效的贴纸。天知道她背后是不是有枪顶着。明日香本该翻看今天拍的照片，研究她在码头 3 号与我那张羊驼脸并排的笑容。我等着她撑不住那伪装，就在她脸颊泛红即将崩溃之前……

Longer than that. Asuka's lips crawl in like crackling strips of bacon. "Shinji…she –"  
比那更久。明日香的嘴唇蠕动着，像脆皮培根条。“真嗣……她——”

Then I grab her bag out from between her legs and spill out the driver-side door.  
然后我从她两腿间抓起她的包，从驾驶座一侧的门里倒了出来。

I jangle back up the street where I made that left, already needing a blow. The dark isn't the only thing slowing me down – my shorts have so much inertia I think about taking them off. Can't. My house keys are in the pockets, cohabitating with Misato's cross and my wallet and my phone…  
我叮叮当当地沿着那条我左转的街道往回走，已经需要喘口气了。黑暗并不是唯一让我放慢脚步的东西——我的短裤有太多惯性，我甚至考虑脱掉它们。不行。我的家门钥匙在口袋里，和美里子的十字架、我的钱包和手机同居一室……

I chop my feet to dig the Sanyo out past my keys and a cluster of napkins. The scrap paper comes out next; though I don't recognize the phone number that goes with it, I've obliterated the street on the paper in a hundred-hundred simulations. The street should be very close by. I dial, hit full stride, and barrel right, watching our old place flounce back into view. It ogles the downtown skyline with one orange eye.  
我跺着脚，把三洋手机从钥匙和一团餐巾纸中挖出来。接下来是那张废纸；虽然我不认识上面的电话号码，但我已经在脑海中模拟过这条街道无数次。那条街道应该就在附近。我拨号，全力冲刺，然后向右猛冲，看着我们曾经的住处再次映入眼帘。它用一只橙色的眼睛凝视着市中心的摩天大楼。

---

I wobble onto the twelfth floor, and all I can think about is lack of oxygen. In my lungs. In our old place. Soon I'll catch my breath and walk down the hall. I'll watch **M. KATSURAGI** slide into the wall, hear that inner space inhale the fresh outside air. I'll be kindling in a bloom of carnivorous heat.  
我摇摇晃晃地走上第十二层，满脑子都是缺氧的感觉。在我的肺里。在我们旧居的地方。很快我就会喘过气来，走过走廊。我会看着 M. 葛城小姐融入墙壁，听到那内部空间吸入新鲜的外界空气。我将成为一束在食肉性热浪中绽放的引火物。

I'm flung back to my first sortie with Rei, when I was slouched and vacuum-sealed in that embarrassing second skin. When the Fifth Angel drilled into the city while waiting to touch me again. When we were going to die, as I so told her. I swallowed it, as I do all facts I'm given – stared at the old gum on the rubber floor mats – and waited for the fact to demonstrate itself. I walk up to **M. KATSURAGI** with that preserved, easy acceptance.  
我被甩回到与绫波的第一次出击，那时我蜷缩着，尴尬地裹在那层令人难堪的第二层皮肤里。当第五使徒钻入城市，等待再次触碰我时。当我们即将死去，正如我告诉她的那样。我吞下了这个事实，就像我接受所有被给予的事实一样——盯着橡胶地板垫上的旧口香糖——等待事实自我展现。我带着那种保存完好的轻松接受态度走向 M. 葛城小姐。

The door sighs open. Hot feelers from the scorching body inside steal over me. I'm not alive – just the recipient of what has been given to me up to this moment.  
门轻轻地叹息着打开。来自内部炽热躯体的灼热触感悄然袭来。我并未活着——只是到此刻为止所被赋予的一切的接收者。

I'm given the smoky foyer, the run of the blackened kitchen. But a nation of flames revels in the living room, its banners billowing up the walls.  
我被留在了烟雾缭绕的门厅，自由穿梭于漆黑的厨房。然而，客厅里却是一片火焰的国度，旗帜在墙上翻腾飘扬。

I'm given the washroom and its furo. I'm given Asuka's fire-retardant blanket, which I soak in the furo along with a ribbon of tee-shirt I sheared off. My ragged, sopping mask. The blanket I fit snug about my shoulders and head, then double up like the skin folds on a bloodhound. I dare to keep the blanket loose at my feet; Misato wore a kimono once, when Pen-Pen belly-flopped into her bound legs like a Honda ramming a resplendent light pole. Then everything became Misato toppling over, flapping flightless wings, and Asuka, Asuka laughing her ass off…  
我得到了浴室和它的浴缸。我得到了明日香那件防火毯，我在浴缸里把它和一条从 T 恤上剪下的布条一起浸湿。还有我那破烂不堪、湿漉漉的面罩。我把毯子紧紧裹在肩上和头上，然后像猎犬的皮肤褶皱一样叠起来。我敢让毯子在我脚边松散；有一次，美里穿着和服，当企鹅潘-潘像本田撞向华丽的灯柱一样扑进她绑着的双腿时，一切都变成了美里摔倒，扑腾着无力的翅膀，而明日香，明日香笑得前仰后合……

Loose at my feet. I fly.  
脚边松散。我飞翔。

My eyes are closed and hooded over. Fire brushes me like the kindled hands of groupies – everywhere is roaring celebrity. I measure my steps to my bedroom against the year I was late for school or my cell phone rang on my bed or I ran stark naked from the furo to my room because Misato forgot to wash the towels again. I break to the right here, always, always _here_…  
我的双眼紧闭，眼皮沉重。火焰如狂热粉丝的双手般轻拂着我——四周尽是喧嚣的名人氛围。我按照当年迟到上学、手机在床上响起或因美里再次忘记洗毛巾而赤裸裸从浴室冲回房间的步伐，测量着走向卧室的每一步。在这里，我总是，总是向右转……

I throw my weight over my hip, cartwheeling. I'm not surprised when the corridor does not give at first – I'm not alive, after all, but the mere sum of my orders, a gourd for the selfishness of others. I am the most retardant thing ever. I think of it this way, and think only of this, because otherwise I'll think of her smile and it'll burn with me…  
我侧身一跃，翻了个筋斗。当走廊起初没有反应时，我并不惊讶——毕竟，我并非活物，只是命令的集合体，一个装满他人自私的葫芦。我是最迟钝的存在。我这样想着，只这样想着，否则我会想起她的微笑，那将如火焰般灼烧我……

Then my bedroom door caves to my shoulder like a balsa wood sternum. The door falls inward, clapping the tatami mat before tumbling me off. I account for each of my arms and legs as I draw them in. The pain in my collar, the hot soot eddies starting to swirl on the roof of my room, they keep me low.  
随后，我的卧室门如轻木胸骨般被我的肩膀撞开。门向内倒下，拍打着榻榻米，又将我绊倒。我收回四肢，一一清点。颈部的疼痛，房间屋顶上开始旋转的热灰，它们让我保持低姿态。

Asuka told me the truth, at least as far as her not getting around to my room. For this very short moment, flames tease the front wall closest to the common corridor, saturating the air inside the empty room with heat. Nothing squatting or hanging or standing in here to burn, anyway. The inferno outside the room throws a rippling dawn on the vacant walls. In the watery corner of my eye, a low mound bends the firelight as if crouching before a projector. I look straight at the shape to gauge its distance and iron spikes drive themselves into my shoulder; there's no dial, no circuit to attenuate the pain.  
明日香告诉了我真相，至少是她没来过我房间的部分。就在这短暂的瞬间，火焰轻触着离公共走廊最近的墙面，将空房间内的空气炙烤得滚烫。反正这里也没有什么可燃之物，无论是蹲着的、挂着的还是立着的。房间外的火海在空荡的墙上映出波光粼粼的晨曦。在我眼角的余光中，一个低矮的土堆弯曲了火光，仿佛正蹲在投影仪前。我直视着那形状，试图估量它的距离，铁钉般的剧痛却猛地刺入我的肩膀；没有刻度盘，没有电路来减弱这痛楚。

I'm alive again. Must be those, younger, fresher facts. Truer facts, invocations of protection Rei whispered to me as I sagged over old gum on a locker mat.  
我又活了过来。一定是那些更年轻、更新鲜的事实。更真实的事实，绫波零在我瘫倒在储物柜垫上的旧口香糖上时，对我低语的守护咒语。

Listen to me – crammed with holdovers from my entry plug days. Take the video overlay we summoned with our thoughts. Like those, I superimpose Nozomi's ridiculous biomass over the hot void. I can see how her tweed overalls would ignite; how her pasta-dog murals would blister, pucker and pop. How tubes of acrylic paint would burst like Kozo Fuyutski's aorta. All of it. It would take forever to burn.  
听我说——塞满了我在插入栓时代留下的残留物。看看我们用思维召唤出的视频叠加层。就像那样，我将野野濑的荒谬生物量叠加在这炽热的虚空之上。我能想象她的格子呢工装裤如何点燃；她的意面狗壁画如何起泡、皱缩并爆裂。那些丙烯颜料管如何像富士树子的心脏一样爆开。所有的一切。要烧尽它们需要无尽的时间。

_Ikari…? 碇…？_

I cough out a piston's worth of combusted air and toggle the overlay back off, utterly undressing the room.  
我咳出一股燃烧的空气，再次关闭了覆盖层，彻底剥离了房间的伪装。

So it's my fault Rei is sitting in the corner, naked.  
所以，真嗣赤裸着坐在角落是我的错。

---

We crouch behind a dumpster.  
我们蹲在一个垃圾箱后面。

Rei looks depleted. It might just be my shirt on her, caked with body salt and pit sweat…and smoke-inundated, _and_ carved up to make my face cloth. Or it's the blanket riding her shoulders, a charcoal cape and cowl. But then I raise the flashlight to her face, which hovers in place of the moon. Grey lunar seas fill the basins below her eyes. Someone's plastered her hair to her scalp and teased a thousand reflections out of it, like blue broken glass. Ever since we sat down, she's been investigating a weed that's wriggled up through a crack in the sidewalk.  
丽看起来疲惫不堪。或许是她身上那件沾满体盐和腋汗、烟熏火燎且被裁剪成面巾的我的衬衫所致……也可能是披在她肩上的那条毯子，像一件炭黑色的斗篷和风帽。但当我将手电筒举向她的脸庞，那张脸悬浮在月亮的位置上。灰色的月海填满了她眼下的凹陷。有人将她的头发粘贴在头皮上，从中挑出一千个反射的光点，如同破碎的蓝色玻璃。自从我们坐下后，她就一直在观察一株从人行道裂缝中钻出的野草。

Rei looks dazzling. I wonder if she'll say 'thank you' if I tell her that. I wonder if she'll say anything at all.  
丽看起来光彩夺目。我在想，如果我告诉她这一点，她会不会说声‘谢谢’。我在想，她会不会说些什么。

"We can get something to eat once we're out of here. The MOS Burger out here sells veggie patties." I dig through the backpack, remembering the Pepsi Asuka pouched there. "Thirsty?"  
“等我们出去后可以吃点东西。外面的 MOS Burger 有卖素食汉堡。”我翻找着背包，想起了里面装着的百事明日香饮料。“口渴吗？”

Rei blinks. She breathes, I think. I click the flashlight off. Midnight closes in on her face – seals it with silence. She could be a 30-gallon garbage bag. She could be dead. I drape my arm around her to feel her body heat through the synthetic wool of the blanket. I feel the scratch of the fabric on my naked ribs. I feel bone, too. Not surprising – it seems I always end up putting my hands where they don't belong on Rei. She was lighter than a dream when I hauled her out of the room. She was always a thin slice of cake, too…but had mom been this light, this skinny when she was, what, twenty-three? If I hold Rei any tighter, I'll break something inside her.  
绫波眨了眨眼。她似乎在呼吸。我关掉了手电筒。午夜笼罩在她的脸上——用寂静封印。她可能像一个 30 加仑的垃圾袋。她可能已经死了。我用胳膊环绕着她，通过合成羊毛毯感受她的体温。我能感觉到布料在我裸露的肋骨上摩擦。我也能感觉到骨头。这并不意外——似乎我总是把手放在绫波不该放的地方。当我把她从房间里拖出来时，她轻得像一个梦。她一直像一片薄薄的蛋糕……但妈妈在她二十三岁的时候，也是这么轻，这么瘦吗？如果我再抱紧绫波一点，我可能会弄坏她身体里的什么东西。

I hope she lost something in the fire.  
我希望她在火灾中失去了些什么。

Our old apartment faces the front of the building. From where I'm sitting, on the side of the complex, I can't see the blaze, can't even tell it's there. Like hell it isn't there. It's rollicking.  
我们旧公寓正对着大楼的前方。我坐在这边，从综合楼的侧面看去，看不到火光，甚至察觉不到它的存在。该死的，它明明就在那儿，熊熊燃烧着。

I start quenching its place in my mind. Can't help it. It's nearly one o' clock. Today will be tomorrow if I nod off. And I don't know enough about this Rei to be sure she'll still be by my side when I wake up. I'm not ready to find out yet, and Rei might not be ready, eith –  
我开始在脑海中扑灭它的位置。忍不住这么做。快到一点钟了。如果我打盹，今天就会变成明天。而且我对这个丽不太了解，无法确定醒来时她是否还会在我身边。我还没准备好去发现这一点，而丽可能也没准备好，要么——

I hear sirens. A whole hell of a lot of sirens exploding up the hillside. I think about the jazz quartet earlier today, but now spiked with gamma radiation, feral and huge and green. Their instruments blast jet-engine homicidal glee. Their rage set punches through my eardrums...  
我听到警笛声。一大堆警笛声在山坡上炸开。我想起了今天早些时候的爵士四重奏，但现在它们被伽马辐射强化，变得狂野、巨大且绿色。他们的乐器发出喷气发动机般的杀戮快感。他们的愤怒冲击穿透了我的耳膜……

I can hear tomorrow. I hear them asking Rei how'd she get to living so goddamn far off the grid. I hear them puzzling it out behind two-way glass and over coffee mugs stamping brown hoops on affidavits. Humming Earth, Wind & Fire as they run her ungodly metrics. Promising her they'll take good care of her, good _good_ care, just you see, kiddo. I hear the hollow clap of their mitts on her coat hanger collar. I hear nothing from Rei.  
我能听见明天。我听见他们问丽如何能住在那么偏远的地方。我听见他们在双向镜后和咖啡杯旁苦思冥想，咖啡渍在宣誓书上留下棕色印记。他们哼着《地球、风与火》的曲子，运行着她那不可思议的指标。向她承诺会好好照顾她，非常非常周到的照顾，你等着瞧吧，孩子。我听见他们空洞的掌声拍在她衣架般的领口上。我从丽那里听不到任何声音。

I stand. I swoon. The fire's melted everything in my head; the ore makes me top-heavy. I can't hear the sirens until my head slops back: they're closer. They're freight trains screwing beneath the stars.  
我站起身。我感到晕眩。火焰已将我脑海中的一切融化；矿石让我头重脚轻。直到我的头向后仰，我才听到警笛声：它们更近了。它们像是星辰下的货运列车在交缠。

I click the flashlight back on, showcasing the mute druid next to me. "Come on, we can't wait anymore…_Rei.._."  
我再次打开手电筒，照亮了身旁沉默的德鲁伊。“快点，我们不能再等了……丽……”

I'd only have to drag Rei far enough so that we're not seen by the first responders. I'd feel better about our chances if she carried herself. She's not crippled – yes, I pulled her up from my bedroom floor, but I saw her naked legs lock straight at her knees. I watched her take a smooth step back.  
我只需要把丽拖到足够远的地方，确保我们不会被第一批救援人员发现。如果她能自己走，我会对我们的机会更有信心。她并没有残废——是的，我从卧室地板上把她拉了起来，但我看到她的裸腿在膝盖处笔直锁紧。我看着她平稳地后退了一步。

"Rei, you have to give me something here…"  
“丽，你得在这里帮我一把……”

I'm bent over, grabbing a fistful of fuzzy cloth and sinew, when headlights slam the dumpster's shadow against the apartment façade. The radio chatter will come next. Oh, yes, with the fire trucks purring in place on the street, the clinking of buckled belts and harnesses, primary colors wheeling in a lunatic centrifuge. But it's too damn quiet here. The fire engines are still farting chaos a few blocks down.  
我弯着腰，抓着一把毛茸茸的布料和筋肉，这时车灯猛地将垃圾箱的影子投射在公寓外墙上。接下来会是无线电的嘈杂声。哦，没错，随着消防车在街上低沉地轰鸣，皮带和马具的叮当声，主色调在疯狂的离心机中旋转。但这里实在太安静了。消防车还在几个街区外制造混乱。

I step out past the dumpster's edge. Rei moves with me. The gentle, felt tension she puts on my wrist keeps me from tilting too far into the high beams. Between dual coronas someone stands, their silhouette tall and charred black.  
我跨出垃圾箱的边缘。丽跟着我移动。她轻轻地拉住我的手腕，防止我过度倾斜进高光束中。在双重光环之间，有个人站立着，他们的轮廓高大且被熏黑。

"Where the fuck have you been?" Touji's voice. His true voice, a guttural boom now that puberty has stopped choking up on his vocal cords. The sound barrels down from a high place as Rei and I scurry through the hole in the fence. "I don't get so much as one fucking messenger pigeon from you for eight fucking years, and then from outta the middle of the goddamn blue my phone is bitch fitting all over my table and it's your _holy shit is that Ayanami_?"  
“你他妈到底去哪儿了？”这是冬二的声音。他真正的声音，青春期不再卡住他的声带，变得低沉有力。这声音从高处压下来，我和丽急忙穿过篱笆上的洞。“我八年没收到你一只该死的信鸽，然后突然间，我的手机就在桌上疯狂震动，我他妈的听到‘天哪，那是绫波吗？’”

"Drive," I say, packing Rei and myself into the back of his coupe. Thicker than twins in the womb, we are. My shoulder complains as I reach back out to shut the door. Touji's about to complain louder – he scowls back at us from the driver's seat. Then he gives Rei the once over. The crossness drains from his face like low tide. "Touji!"  
“开车，”我说着，把丽和我自己塞进他的轿跑后座。我们挤得像子宫里的双胞胎。我伸手去关门时，肩膀抱怨着。冬二正要更大声地抱怨——他从驾驶座上皱着眉回头看我们。然后他仔细打量了丽一番。脸上的怒气像退潮一样消失了。“冬二！”

"Shit…" he says, cuffing the stick shift with his palm. The car shimmies, smoothing out as we curl around to the front of the building. Past everything going on in the front of the building. I don't have to watch the fire. Touji's face is dry and gaping and orange enough for the both of us. His eyes snag mine in the rearview mirror. "Are you for real?"  
"该死…" 他用掌心扣住换挡杆。车子颤动了一下，当我们绕到建筑物前时平稳下来。经过建筑物前的一切混乱。我不必看那场火。东治的脸干巴巴地张着，橙色的火光足够代表我们俩。他的眼睛在后视镜里抓住了我的视线。"你是认真的吗？"

"I think you should take the scenic route," I say. Rei slumps back as the car shoots away from the spectacle. A pothole leans her onto my shoulder. She stays there. Careful not to elbow her in the throat, I twist around to peek through the rear window. Down at the side of the building, a red and blue pulse quickens, brightens...  
"我觉得你应该走风景路线，" 我说。丽随着车子从那场混乱中疾驰而去而向后瘫倒。一个坑洼让她靠在了我的肩上。她就这样待着。小心不碰到她的喉咙，我扭过身去透过后窗窥视。在建筑物侧面，红蓝闪烁的光加速、变亮...

We turn down a side street. The neighborhood evolves up ahead, with street lamps spouting dunce caps of light onto either side of the road. The street is empty.  
我们拐进一条小街。前方的街区逐渐变化，路灯在道路两侧投下愚人帽般的灯光。街道空无一人。

"You know I gotta be at the Tea Bone at six o' clock, don't you? Six shitting o' clock, Shinji. Do you understand? Do you not work for a living?"  
"你知道我得在六点钟赶到茶骨，对吧？六点，该死的六点，真嗣。你明白吗？你难道不用工作吗？"

I take in air to speak and I taste what Rei's hair smells like. It's the generic shampoo I found in those suitcases that passed for Geofront barracks; prepackaged industrial cloy. "Acoustic Designer."  
我深吸一口气准备说话，却尝到了丽头发的味道。那是我在那些被当作地底前线基地的行李箱里找到的普通洗发水；预包装的工业甜腻。“声学设计师”。

"Even Aida's Soldier-of-Fortune ass calls me once a …" Touji trails off. The cup in the center console disappears in his paw as he chugs its contents. He takes the back of his hand to his mouth and flips the cup into the leg space for the front passenger seat, a styrofoam mass grave.  
"就连相田那个雇佣兵也会每隔一段时间给我打一次电话……" 冬二话音渐弱。他手中的杯子在他手中一饮而尽，随后用袖口抹了抹嘴，将空杯子扔进了副驾驶座下的空间，那里成了一个泡沫塑料的坟场。

"But it's like this:" Our reflected eyes lock again, "tea can't just make itself. Like acoustics can't…design themselves – don't say they can, dick. Tea can't make itself and Setsuko, love her to death, Setsuko couldn't make tea between S and U." He shakes his head. "She brews the numbers, I boil the water – _in the morning_. I need sleep, Ikari. I think we all do."  
"但问题是这样："我们的目光再次在镜中相遇，"茶不会自己泡好。就像声学不会……自己设计一样——别说不行，混蛋。茶不会自己泡好，而干瘦的 Setsuko，尽管我非常爱她，Setsuko 也没法在 S 和 U 之间泡茶。"他摇摇头。"她煮数字，我烧水——在早上。我需要睡眠，碇。我想我们都一样。"

He's right, but that's not why I'm snickering. This rugby fullback, this basketball star, this really, really big and tall person, in a shop apron, tying a magenta bow around his waist: it's just tasty, old-fashioned bait. I pull Rei close enough for her to feel the watery laughter vibrate in my chest. The laughter resonates – I can't stop it from migrating up my throat. But it leaves my mouth as a hiccup. The water's reached my eyes and is well on its way to spilling out.  
他说得没错，但这不是我偷笑的原因。这位橄榄球后卫，这位篮球明星，这位真的、真的高大魁梧的人，穿着店里的围裙，腰间系着紫红色的蝴蝶结：这简直是诱人的老派饵料。我拉近丽，让她感受到我胸腔中水波般的笑声在震动。笑声回荡——我无法阻止它从喉咙上移。但它离开我的嘴时变成了一个嗝。泪水已经涌上我的眼眶，正准备溢出。

Touji says, "I'm just a little amped, man…" Then he drops us down on a busier, larger street, where Toyotas flash us their red flanks as they hum past. He watches the road.  
冬二说："我只是有点兴奋，伙计……"然后他把我们带到了一条更繁忙、更宽阔的街道上，丰田车闪着红色的侧身从我们身边嗡嗡驶过。他注视着路面。

Over Rei's dipped crown, through the cracked port window, the skyline chases us. Not for long, though; Touji's place is nearby; new and cheap, to entice young skilled labor to a city jonesing for it. People like Touji and Hikari.  
越过丽低垂的头顶，透过裂开的舷窗，城市的天际线追逐着我们。不过不会太久；东治的住处就在附近；新且廉价，旨在吸引渴望年轻技术劳动力的城市。像东治和光这样的人。

End of Blanking Bridges 《空白桥梁的终结》

A/N: Credit goes to the EvaGeeks episode wiki for the Mandelbrot Lake reference, _and_ for the floor plan of Misato's apartment. They were both very helpful. Not much else to say on this front. Thank you for reading. Hope I didn't eat too many sacred cows.  
作者注：感谢 EvaGeeks 剧集维基提供的曼德尔布罗特湖参考和美里公寓的平面图，两者都非常有帮助。在这方面没有太多要说的了。感谢阅读。希望我没有吃掉太多神圣的牛。

Random A/N: And speaking of burned mammals: I once received a comment for one of my stories from a fire fighter. I thought of him as I was writing that inferno scene. Sir, if you're reading this: Shinji should be really, really dead, shouldn't he? He should be five different smoky flavors of crisp, shouldn't he? Got a minute? Search for the floor plan on the Eva Geeks wiki, under "Misato's Apartment". How long would it take him to run from the kitchen to his room and back, shrouded in a flame-proof blanket?  
随笔：说到被烧的哺乳动物：我曾收到一位消防员对我某篇故事的评论。写那场火灾场景时，我想起了他。先生，如果您在看这个：真嗣应该真的、真的死了，对吧？他应该成了五种不同烟熏口味的脆片，对吧？有空吗？在 Eva Geeks 维基上找找“美里公寓”的平面图。裹着防火毯的他从厨房跑到房间再回来需要多长时间？

Ah, well. Shinji did, after all, open a super-heated hatch to save one girl, and jump into a volcano to save another. Boy stays in the kitchen, is all.  
啊，好吧。毕竟，真嗣曾为了救一个女孩打开过高温舱门，还跳进火山救过另一个。男孩就该待在厨房里，仅此而已。

People, it's the year 2023, alright? A scientist did it.  
各位，现在是 2023 年，好吗？是科学家干的。

Thank you for reading and your criticism. Ja.  
感谢阅读及您的批评。Ja。

What do you mean it's not college basketball season…? :-(  
你说现在不是大学篮球赛季是什么意思…？:-(

### Comment
[Violet Shadows](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1244304/Violet-Shadows): Sometimes ambiguity helps a piece and sometimes it hurts it. Given the relationships involved I think this was the former.  
有时候，模糊性对作品有益，有时候则有害。考虑到涉及的关系，我认为这是前者。

[iamjustanotherguy](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1408759/iamjustanotherguy): I'm with most people on this one. I loved it and it had me then Rei was there...I'm really simple...do you got an idiots guide or anything cause...wait...were the clothes for Rei? I may have to re-read this...five or six times...oh well this was wonderful and...has confused me...but enjoyable nonetheless. Later  
我和大多数人的看法一致。我非常喜欢，尤其是丽出现的时候...我真的很简单...你有没有傻瓜指南之类的，因为...等等...那些衣服是给丽的吗？我可能得重读这个...五到六遍...不过这真是太棒了，虽然让我有点困惑...但依然很享受。再见

[Fresh C](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/798429/Fresh-C):
The prose here is involved and quite fun to read. This is the type of crazy imagery and odd references that I've always loved about your style. And I felt that I understood almost all of it too, right up until the part where Shinji gets out of the car. Then I felt like I missed something.  
这里的散文复杂且非常有趣。这种疯狂的意象和奇特的引用一直是我喜爱你风格的原因。而且我觉得我几乎都理解了，直到碇真嗣下车那部分，我才感觉自己漏掉了什么。  
  
*spoilers*  *剧透*  
  
At first I thought Shinji was rushing back in because he just realized that Misato was dead and he couldn't accept it. I thought that maybe that was why Asuka was burning down the apartment. That she was trying to get him to move on with his life. I thought that because of the line "Shinji she-". I figured he cut her off because he didn't want to know what came next. And really everything in the fire might have supported that...  
起初，我以为真嗣急忙返回是因为他刚刚意识到美里已经去世，而他无法接受这个事实。我想，也许这就是为什么明日香要烧毁公寓的原因。她可能是想让他继续生活下去。我这么想是因为那句‘真嗣，她——’。我猜他打断她是因为他不想知道接下来会发生什么。而且，火中的所有一切可能都支持了这一点……  
  
Then he found Rei... and I realized I was completely lost.  
然后他找到了丽……我意识到我完全迷失了。  
  
Now either there's some big hint that Rei's in the apartment that I missed (a possibility). Or it was meant to be a random surprise. You did allude to the fact that there was a squatter in there so it's not completely out of the blue. But even so, two questions are left: "Why would Asuka knowingly kill Rei?" (this question is not that bad of one, and could be left unanswered because really there are many reasons she might have from the series and just knowing Asuka's character) and the second question "How did Shinji know that there was someone in the apartment at all?" (this question is the important one, because it's gnawing at my brain trying to figure out your thought process)  
现在，要么是有一个我错过的关于丽在公寓里的大提示（有可能）。要么这本意就是一个随机的惊喜。你确实暗示过那里有个非法居住者，所以这并不完全出乎意料。但即便如此，还有两个问题：‘为什么明日香会明知故犯地杀死丽？’（这个问题不算太糟糕，可以不回答，因为从系列中和她的人物性格来看，她可能有多种原因）和第二个问题‘真嗣是怎么知道公寓里有人？’（这个问题很重要，因为它让我绞尽脑汁试图弄清楚你的思路）  
  
Anyways, it was definitely an interesting read aside from the confusion it's caused me. The prose was again, top notch and I enjoyed seeing the eva characters "all grown up" and shown in detail. I particularly liked daycare teacher Hikari. I look forward to finding out exactly what it was that I missed here...  
总之，除了让我感到困惑之外，这绝对是一篇引人入胜的读物。文笔一如既往地出色，我很喜欢看到《EVA》角色们“长大成人”并被详细描绘的样子。我特别喜欢幼儿园老师光。我期待着弄清楚我在这里究竟错过了什么...

[NemesisZero](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/94665/NemesisZero): A fine piece of work. The prose straddles the line between complex and confusing, but it's usually quite palatable.Rei was a surprise, though I really should have picked up that earlier hint. Very sloppy of me.I'm not sure what to think of Asuka's role in this, however. She gets no closure, never gets a chance to actually explain herself. She's just a fact of the story, a part of it's landscape.
一件精妙的作品。文笔介于复杂与混乱之间，但通常颇为可读。丽是个意外，尽管我本应早些察觉那个暗示。真是我的疏忽。至于明日香在这故事中的角色，我则不太确定。她没有得到任何了结，从未有机会真正解释自己。她只是故事的一个事实，是其风景的一部分。

Name:
Uh, I'm a bit lost on this one too. I mean, it's not unusual for your stories not to be all that much for the simple mainstream, and that's far from being a bad thing.  
呃，这个我也有些困惑。我是说，你的故事不太迎合主流口味并不罕见，这绝非坏事。  
  
And though I had some question marks popping up here and there (especially concerning their/Asuka's motivation), I at least think I got the gist of this - until the end. Asuka doesn't see the apartment as her home, so Shinji decides to run back, into the burning house? Huh? And, whoa, Rei's there? WTF? Oh, and what about Asuka anyway? Did she just decided to drive back by herself?  
虽然我有些地方不太明白（尤其是关于他们/明日香的动力），但至少我觉得我大致理解了——直到结尾。明日香不把公寓视为家，所以真嗣决定跑回那燃烧的房子？哈？然后，哇，丽在那里？什么鬼？哦，还有明日香呢？她就这么决定自己开车回去吗？  
  
I mean, did Asuka plan to kill Rei all along for some reason and Shinji realized it *somehow* by her saying that she doesn't regard it as her home? Did it hurt him so much that Asuka didn't share his view of the apartment that he wants to kill himself along with it, and Rei being there is just a ridiculously huge coincidence?  
我是说，阿斯卡是不是从一开始就出于某种原因计划杀死丽，而真嗣通过她说不把这里当作家的话*某种方式*意识到了这一点？阿斯卡不认同他对公寓的看法，这让他如此痛苦，以至于他想和公寓一起自杀，而丽在那里只是一个荒谬的巨大巧合吗？  
  
Or was it always supposed to be just a huge mass of randomness to make us readers leaving scratching their heads? Mission accomplished in that case, at least for this reader here.  
还是说，这本就是一大堆随机事件，让我们读者看得一头雾水？至少对这位读者来说，任务算是完成了。
