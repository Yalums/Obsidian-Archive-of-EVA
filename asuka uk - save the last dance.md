Save The Last Dance 最后一支舞  
  
**************************************************************************************  
Shinji Ikari found himself starring out of the window, lost in thought, wondering why she never paid any attention to him. Why does she push him away just when he's starting to get close to her. He found himself being brought back to reality by a sharp thud at the back of his head, by a pencil. Followed by yht voice of it's owner.  
碇真嗣发现自己正凝视着窗外，陷入沉思，想知道为什么她从不关注他。为什么她总是在他开始接近她时推开他。他被身后一声尖锐的撞击声——一支铅笔——拉回了现实，紧接着是铅笔主人的声音。  
"It's lunchtime Shinji, are you listening to me? Did you remember to make my lunch?" Barked the female voice.  
“午饭时间了，真嗣，你在听我说话吗？你记得给我做午饭了吗？”女声厉声问道。  
"Oh Asuka , yes here's your lunch" which he then handed over to the flustered red head. She took it from him, then sat down next to Hikari. the two girls voices filled Shinji's head as they carried on with their conversation. *She didn't even say thank you*  
"“哦，明日香，你的午餐在这里。”他将午餐递给了慌张的红发女孩。她从他手中接过，然后坐在了光旁边。两个女孩的声音充斥着真嗣的脑海，她们继续着对话。*她甚至没说谢谢*”  
"Hey shinji, I see Asuka has got you trained well" Toji said as he approached his friend with a smirk on his face.  
"“嘿，真嗣，看来明日香把你训练得不错啊。” 阿薰说着，带着一丝戏谑走向他的朋友。”  
"Boy I wish Asuka would train me instead" Sighed Kensuke as he sat down next to Shinji.  
"“天哪，我真希望明日香能来训练我。” 健介叹了口气，坐在了真嗣旁边。”  
"You're welcome to it, but i'm telling you that girl has high standers. Then again I don't mind making the lunches. She enjoys them that's the main thing" With that he glanced in Asuka's direction, to see her smiling seamingly enjoying her lunch that he spent time making for her.  
“你可以随意，但我得告诉你，那女孩标准很高。不过，我倒不介意做午餐。她喜欢就好，这才是关键。” 说着，他瞥向明日香的方向，看到她似乎正享受着他花时间为她准备的午餐，脸上挂着微笑。  
"Shinji, you're sounding like your falling love with a certain red haired devil" Toji eyed his friend.  
“真嗣，你听起来像是对某个红发魔女坠入爱河了。” 冬二打量着他的朋友。  
"I....I..I never said that" Shinji protested even though deep down in his heart he knew that it was true. *Oh why did I fall in love with her* Toji seeing his friend in some distress decided it waas a good idea not to tease him further, therefore thought better and changed the subject.  
“我……我……我从没说过那样的话。” 真嗣辩解道，尽管他内心深处知道这是真的。*哦，我为什么会爱上她* 冬二看到朋友有些困扰，决定不再继续逗他，于是明智地换了话题。  
"you know the end of school year dance is this friday. Have you asked anyone yet?" Toji asked "I'm sure Rei will go with you"  
“你知道这周五是学年末舞会吧。你已经邀请谁了吗？” 冬二问道，“我相信丽会和你一起去的。”  
"To be honest I Don't think it's Rei's kind of scene. I haven't decieded who to ask yet. You should take Hikari, Toji, both me and Asuka agree that she fancies you so your garenteed tha she'll say yes" toji seamed shocked at this, but recovered quickly.  
“老实说，我觉得这不是丽的风格。我还没决定邀请谁。你应该带光去，冬二，我和明日香都认为她对你有意思，所以你肯定她会答应的。” 冬二对此显得很震惊，但很快恢复了过来。  
"Errrm....s..sso you and Asuka agreed on something. It must be love" Shinji smiled *I hope your right, Toji, I might just ask her to the dance*  
“呃……你和明日香居然达成了共识。这一定是爱吧。” 真嗣微笑着，*希望你是对的，冬二，我可能会邀请她去舞会。*  
  
**************************************************************************************  
He and Asuka walked back home in silence at first. But then the silence was broken.  
他和明日香起初默默地走回家。但随后，沉默被打破了。  
"Boring, that teacher just goes on about the second impact. The world just never seams to move on"  
“真无聊，那老师一直在讲第二次冲击。世界似乎永远停滞不前。”  
*Is she talking to me or just out load*  
*她是在跟我说话，还是只是在自言自语？*  
"Errrr, Asuka can I ask you some thing"  
“呃，明日香，我能问你点事儿吗？”  
"Sure, what is it Shinji?"  
“当然可以，什么事，真嗣？”  
"Are you going to the dance with anyone?"  
“你要和谁一起去参加舞会吗？”  
"Unforunately not. They must be scared of my radient beauty. Or afraid of the fact that my position as an Eva-pilot, makes me so far above them, that they dare not ask"  
“不幸的是，并非如此。他们一定是被我那耀眼的美貌吓到了。或者是因为我作为 EVA 驾驶员的地位，使他们觉得我高不可攀，以至于不敢开口。”  
"Oh, T.Then would y...y...you"  
“哦，T，那么你...你...你会...”  
"What is it ,just spit it out" Shinji took a deep breath and summed up all the courage he could muster.  
“有什么事，直接说出来吧。”真嗣深吸一口气，鼓起所有勇气说道。  
"Will You Go To The Dance With Me" Asuka stopped in her tracks, stunned that Shinji of all men. Had just asked her to the dance. She was flattered she wanted her to say yes, but her pride stopped her.  
“你能和我一起去参加舞会吗？” 明日香停下脚步，震惊于居然是真嗣这个家伙。他刚刚邀请她去舞会。她感到受宠若惊，想要答应，但她的骄傲阻止了她。  
"Why would you think I would go to the dance with a wimp like you Third Chil" and with that she ran as fast as she could home leaving Shinji standing thier in the street. With tears forming in his eyes.  
“你凭什么认为我会和一个像你这样的窝囊废去舞会，第三适格者？” 说完，她飞快地跑回家，留下真嗣站在街上，泪水在眼眶中打转。  
  
**************************************************************************************  
By the time Shinji got back to the apppartment it was late. He decieded to walk home slowly giving him time to gather himself together, and for Asuka to calm down.  
当真嗣回到公寓时，天色已晚。他决定慢慢走回家，给自己时间整理情绪，也让明日香冷静下来。  
"I'm home" he said weakly knowing Misato was working late, and considering what happened between him and Asuka, she wasn't going to reply.  
“我回来了。”他虚弱地说道，知道美里工作到很晚，而且考虑到他和明日香之间发生的事，她也不会回应。  
"Shinji may I have a Word please, I'm in the kitchen" He made his way through the hallway to find Asuka sitting at the kitchen table in her yellow sundress. Her eyes seamed reddened. Possible she's been crying  
“真嗣，我能和你谈谈吗？我在厨房。”他穿过走廊，发现明日香穿着她的黄色太阳裙坐在厨房桌旁。她的眼睛似乎红红的，可能哭过。  
Shinji throught. *She's going to yell at me again* He sat down opposite her.  
真嗣心想。*她又要对我大吼大叫了* 他坐在她对面。  
"Yes Asuka, what is it?"  
“是的，明日香，什么事？”  
"Shinji I will go to the dance with you" Shinji sat there in stunned silence, wondering if he heard correctly. "We will go together, to show everyone just what us Eva-pilots can do" It dawned on Shinji that this was the catch, and the reason why she was going with him. "We will put everyone to shame, pride is at stake here Shinji, and thanks for asking me" With that she stood up looking down to young man, *Did she just thank me*She turned walked to the couch and put on the TV. Shinji just made his way to his room, put down his school bag. Laided down on his bed and starred at a famillier ceiling. If you looked close enough a smile could be seen. *Asuka is going to the dance with me. I don't care if there is a reason for her to do, So even if she wants to crush everyone. So to speak, the most popular and beautiful girl in school was going with me. Shyinji Ikari*  
“真嗣，我会和你一起去参加舞会。”真嗣坐在那里，震惊得说不出话来，怀疑自己是否听错了。“我们会一起去，向所有人展示我们 EVA 驾驶员能做到什么。”真嗣恍然大悟，这就是她愿意和他一起去的原因。“我们要让所有人相形见绌，荣誉在此一举，真嗣，谢谢你邀请我。”说完，她站起身来俯视着年轻人，*她刚刚是感谢我了吗*她转身走到沙发前打开了电视。真嗣默默地回到自己的房间，放下书包，躺在床上凝视着熟悉的屋顶。如果你仔细看，会发现他嘴角有一丝微笑。*明日香要和我一起去舞会了。我不在乎她有什么理由，即使她是想碾压所有人。换句话说，学校里最受欢迎和最漂亮的女孩要和我一起去。真嗣·碇*  
  
**************************************************************************************  
Asuka walked into the classroom of class 2-A. Hikari, her friend and also the class rep called her over. She seamed excited about something.  
明日香走进了 2-A 班的教室。她的朋友，同时也是班长的光，叫她过去。她看起来对某件事很兴奋。  
"Hikari whats gotten into you this morning?, it's to early for energy like this"  
“光，你今早怎么了？这么早就有这么大的精神劲儿。”  
"Suzahara is taking me to the dance tomorrow night" Asuka looked at ther friend as if she was someone who had lost all their marbles.  
“铃原明天晚上要带我去舞会。”明日香看着她的朋友，仿佛她是个失去了所有理智的人。  
"You're telling that Toji, one of the stooges has asked you to the dance and you said YES"  
“你是说，那个跟班之一的东治邀请你去舞会，你还答应了？”  
"Come on Asuka, Suzahara ain't that bad he just needs a woman like me to pull hime line" Hikari giggled. Asuka just smiled back in return. Seeing that her friend was happy.  
"来吧，明日香，铃原也没那么糟糕，他只是需要像我这样的女人来拉他一把。" 光笑着说。明日香只是微笑着回应，看到她的朋友很开心。  
"Are you going with anyone Asuka?" She thought carefully for a moment thinking how she was going to word, what she was about to say.  
"你和谁一起去呢，明日香？" 她仔细思考了一会儿，想着该如何措辞，表达她即将说的话。  
"Well I took pity when Shinji asked me. So I guess I'm going with him, us Eva-pilots have to stick together" She looked at Hikari hopping that she brought the lie that she just gave, for going with Shinji.  
"嗯，当真嗣邀请我时，我心软了。所以我想我是和他一起去，我们这些 EVA 驾驶员得团结一致。" 她看着光，希望她能相信自己刚编的和真嗣一起去的理由。  
"That's great, I'm sure you'll have a great time. Do you want to go shopping after school for are dresses, Asuka?" Shopping one of Asuka's faviourte past times, other than being an Eva-pilot and defeating the Angels.  
“太好了，我相信你会玩得很开心的。放学后要不要和明日香一起去买礼服？”购物是明日香除了担任 EVA 驾驶员和击败使徒之外最喜欢的消遣。  
"Sure, we must get the guys' shashes that the colour must match our dresses, we must look the part" Both girls let out a giggl that was short lived.  
“当然，我们得确保男生的领带颜色和我们的礼服相配，我们必须看起来像那么回事。”两位女孩发出了一阵短暂的笑声。  
"ASUKA YOUR GOING WITH ASUKA" Toji shouted across the classroom, Asuka turned on her heels and prepared for a different kind of battle.  
“明日香你要和明日香一起去！” 真嗣在教室里大喊，明日香转过身来，准备迎接一场不同类型的战斗。  
"What about it Toji. you don't see me complaining that Hikari is going with YOU, though believe me I would like to give you a piece of my mind on this matter" Toji turned to face the red head, the rest of the class went silent and waited to see what would happen. As battles of wits between these two was always worth watching.  
"“那又怎样，冬二？你没见我抱怨光和你一起去，虽然我真想好好跟你理论一番。”冬二转向红发女孩，全班顿时鸦雀无声，等着看接下来会发生什么。毕竟，这两人的智斗总是值得一看的。”  
"You must of bewitched him, you devil, you put a spell on him didn't you" She went to answer him with her quick reply but Shinji beat her to it.  
"“你一定是施了魔法，你这魔鬼，你对他下了咒，对吧？”她正要迅速回击，但真嗣抢先了一步。”  
"Asuka didn't put a spell on me Toji, just accept that we're going to the dance together. You didn't hear Hikari complain did you. So there is no need for you to" Asuka, Toji not to mention the rest of the class wondered where Shinji had just got the guts to defend her in the way he did. Toji put it down to Asuka giving him some of her fire, her hell fire, thats what had made him this way. Asuka walked over to Shinji and smiled an evil smile at Toji as she did. When she reached shinji she spoke to him in a civil tone really for her.  
"“明日香没有对我施咒，冬二，接受我们一起去舞会的事实吧。你没听光抱怨，对吧？所以你也没必要。”明日香、冬二，还有全班同学都好奇真嗣哪来的勇气这样为她辩护。冬二认为这是明日香给了他一些她的火焰，她的地狱之火，才让他变成这样。明日香走到真嗣身边，对冬二露出一个邪恶的微笑。当她走到真嗣身边时，她用一种对她来说相当文明的语气对他说话。”  
"I'm going shopping tonight with Hikari for dresses. So can you tell Misato when you get home, I'll try not to be to late. Oh and i'll buy your shash for your suit to match me, you do have a suit don't you?" Shinji nodded a reply.  
“我今晚要和光去买裙子。所以你回家后能告诉美里吗，我会尽量不晚的。哦，对了，我会给你买领带来搭配我的衣服，你有西装的，对吧？” 真嗣点头回应。  
"Enjoy your shopping trip" She to just nodded then returned to her seat setting up her laptop before, waiting for the class to begin and another lecture on the second impact.  
“享受你的购物之旅。” 她只是点头，然后回到座位上打开笔记本电脑，等待课程开始，准备听关于第二次冲击的另一场讲座。  
  
**************************************************************************************  
"I'm home" the young boy said as he removed his shoes.  
“我回来了。” 少年边说边脱下鞋子。  
"How was your day?" An older female voice replied. Sounds like it's comming from the living room shinji thought, following the voice. Sure enough there was Misato sitting on the couch, beer in hand, relaxing after her shift at NERV.  
“今天过得怎么样？”一个年长的女性声音回应道。听起来像是从客厅传来的，真嗣心想，跟着声音走去。果然，Misato 正坐在沙发上，手里拿着啤酒，在 NERV 的轮班后放松着。  
"Where's Asuka?" “Asuka 呢？”  
"She's gone shopping with Hikari for the dance tomorrow night. She asked me to tell you that she'd try not ot be late home."  
“她和 Hikari 一起去为明晚的舞会购物了。她让我告诉你她会尽量不晚回家的。”  
"Oh I surpose she needs a new dress" Misato replied as Shinji headed to his room. He put on his SDAT player. Shinji must have blanked out for hours, because the next thing he knew was that he could just make out three voices comming from the living room. So he went to investigate. He peered round the door way, Hikari was showing Misato her dress.  
"“哦，我想她需要一件新裙子。”美里回答道，而真嗣则朝自己的房间走去。他戴上 SDAT 播放器。真嗣一定是恍惚了几个小时，因为接下来他只知道能隐约听到客厅里传来三个人的声音。于是他决定去查看一番。他探头望向门口，发现光正在向美里展示她的裙子。”  
"That's a beautiful dress, yours is great to Asuka, you both be bell of the ball" Misato caught something move out of the cornar of her eye.  
"“那件裙子真漂亮，你的也很棒，明日香，你们俩都会是舞会的焦点。”美里注意到眼角有什么东西动了一下。”  
"Shinji, are you spying on us" the young man turned a shade of crimson nd stepped into the room.  
"“真嗣，你在偷看我们吗？”年轻人顿时满脸通红，走进了房间。”  
"I was wondering what colour my shash was Asuka? thats all" Misato looked at the young woman infront of her. As Asuka rumaged through her bags untill she found what she was looking for, she pulled out a length of deep red silken matterial.  
"“我在想我的缎带是什么颜色的，明日香？就这个。”美里看着面前的年轻女子。明日香在包里翻找了一会儿，终于找到了她要找的东西，抽出了一条深红色的丝绸缎带。”  
"Are you two going to the dance together?" Misato asked as Asuka handed it to him.  
"“你们俩打算一起去跳舞吗？”美里问道，明日香将缎带递给了他。”  
"Is there something wrong with that Misato?" Equuired Shinji worried that his guardien and commanding officer was going to say yes.  
"“这有什么问题吗，美里？”真嗣担心地问，生怕他的监护人和指挥官会说是。”  
"No nothing wrong, just a bit of a surprise thats all" Asuka seized the oppitunity to end the conversation.  
“不，没什么问题，只是有点意外罢了。” 明日香抓住机会结束了对话。  
"Hikari, your getting ready round here tomorrow night. I'm sure Shinji can get ready round Toji's, plus he could give Toji his shash aswell"  
“光，你明晚在这边准备。我相信真嗣可以在东治那边准备好，顺便他还可以把他的东西也给东治。”  
"How come I have to get ready round Toji's?"  
“为什么我得在东治那边准备？”  
"Because your not allowed to see the dress or your date untill she is ready" Asuka told him , as Hikari handed Shinji, Toji's royal blue shash.  
"因为你在她准备好之前不能看她的裙子或约会对象" 明日香告诉他，同时光递给真嗣，东治的皇家蓝领带。  
  
**************************************************************************************  
All the talk at school the next day was about the dance that night Shinji spent most of the day, wondering what Asuka's dress was like.He knew it had to be deep red. But what style. In the end he didn't care Asuka would look good in anything.  
第二天学校里大家都在谈论那晚的舞会，真嗣一整天大部分时间都在想明日香的裙子会是什么样子。他知道一定是深红色的。但会是什么款式呢。最后他不在乎了，明日香穿什么都好看。  
"Hey Shinji are you ready to go the girls won't like it if we're not ready on time, had Asuka told you the plan?"  
"嘿，真嗣，你准备好出发了吗？如果我们不准时，女孩们会不高兴的，明日香告诉你计划了吗？"  
"Yeah we to meet them at Misato's appartment at 7.30pm, oh before I forget. Here's the shash Hikari want you to wear"  
“是的，我们约好了晚上 7 点 30 分在美里小姐的公寓见面，哦，对了，差点忘了。这是光希要你戴的徽章。”  
"Thanks" With that they both headed towards Toji's, both boys wondering what that night had instore for them. *Please no Angel to attack tonight*  
“谢谢。”说完，他们俩一起朝东治家走去，两个男孩都在想今晚会有什么等着他们。*希望今晚不要有使徒来袭*  
  
**************************************************************************************  
"Arrrh why won't my hair go right. ~I want it to cascade, not stick out" Came the voice of a frustrated Asuka.  
“啊，为什么我的头发就是弄不好。~我希望它像瀑布一样垂落，而不是翘起来。”传来明日香沮丧的声音。  
"Let me try" Hikari offered  
“让我试试。”光提议道  
"Oh it's no good I'll have to leave as usual. Dammit I just wanted it different tonight, the boys will be here soon anyway" At hearing the distress in the voice of the girl. Who she started to consider as her daughter.  
“哦，不行，我还是得像往常一样离开。该死，今晚我只是想有所不同，反正男孩们很快就要来了。”听到女孩声音中的焦虑，她开始将她视为自己的女儿。  
"Whats the matter Asuka?"  
“怎么了，明日香？”  
"She can't get her hair to go right"  
“她就是弄不好头发。”  
"It's just sticking out"  
“头发就是翘着。”  
"Lets have one more try" Misato took the hair sticks off the dressing table, and as if by magic placed it in the young womans red hair and acheived the look she wanted. BING BONG. "Just in the nick of time aswell" Misato grinned at the two girls befroe leaving to let the boys in. "Well don't you two look smart in yout suits, I think you bopys are in for a treat tonight" Teased Misato, "Are you ready"  
“再试一次吧。”美里从梳妆台上取下发簪，仿佛施了魔法般将其插进年轻女子的红发中，终于达到了她想要的效果。叮咚。“也正好赶上了时间。”美里对着两个女孩咧嘴一笑，然后离开去让男孩们进来。“你们俩穿上西装真精神，今晚你们这些小伙子可有福了。”美里打趣道，“准备好了吗？”  
"Comming" Replied Hikari.  
"马上就来" 光回答道。  
"I'll be one minute" Asuka spoke as Hikari walked in wearing a royal blue japanesse style dress, but it wasn't to long or to short. She held in her hand matching shoes.  
"我马上就好" 明日香说道，此时光走了进来，身穿一件皇家蓝的日式风格连衣裙，长度既不太长也不太短。她手里拿着与之相配的鞋子。  
"What do you think?" She asked as she twirled around.  
"你觉得怎么样？" 她一边旋转一边问道。  
"You look good" Shinji said *If Hikari look like that then, what does Asuka look like* Toji just stood there in stunned silence before answering.  
"你看起来不错" 真嗣说道，*如果光是那样的话，那明日香看起来会是什么样呢* 阿薰只是站在那里，震惊得哑口无言，半天才回答。  
"WOW"  "哇哦"  
"Asuka you must be done by now" Misato called.  
"明日香，你肯定已经弄好了" 美里喊道。  
"I'm here" She steped into the room Shinji's heart skipped a beat. She stood ther in a sparkling deep red short evening dress. Her hair worn up but without her interface clips. but with hai sticks that cascade down her half bare back. With matching high heelded shoes in her hand.  
“我来了。”她踏进房间，真嗣的心跳漏了一拍。她站在那里，身着闪亮的深红色短款晚礼服。头发盘起，没有戴接口夹，而是插着几根发簪，顺着她半裸的背部垂下。手里还拿着一双相配的高跟鞋。  
"Well say something" Her temper was begin to match her dress.  
“倒是说点什么啊。”她的脾气开始和她的裙子一样火红。  
"Y...Y..You look fantastic" Stammered a shocked Shinji. Grateful at the comment and wanted to show her appreciation. But her pride blocked the way again.  
“你……你看起来棒极了。”真嗣结结巴巴地说，对她的赞美感到欣慰，想要表达自己的欣赏之情。但她的骄傲又一次挡在了前面。  
"Well it was inevitable"  
“唉，这是迟早的事。”  
"Well if you want a lift before I head to work we better leave now"  
“如果你想要搭车，我上班前我们最好现在就走。”  
  
**************************************************************************************  
As Misato sreached into the car park of their school. Music could be hearded comming from the gymnasium. Quiet a few people where outside waiting for friends. But they all turned at the sound of Misato's car pulling up. First to step out was Hikari and Toji, followed by Shinji. Shinji turned holding out his hand to help Asuka out of the car. He knew that she wouldn't take it. *I don't need help* that's what she'd say. To his surprise she gently took it. her tough was soft and gentle to him. And as she stepped out light seemed to dance on her dress. Something silver caught his eye. It was the necklace he brought her for christmas, muttering from people around them could be heard.  
当美里驶入学校的停车场时，可以听到体育馆里传来的音乐声。外面有不少人在等朋友。但当美里的车停下时，所有人都转过头来。首先下车的是光和真嗣，接着是真嗣。真嗣转身，伸出手帮助明日香下车。他知道她不会接受。*我不需要帮助* 她会这么说。令他惊讶的是，她轻轻地握住了他的手。她的手柔软而温柔。当她下车时，光线似乎在她裙子上跳跃。他注意到某样银色的东西。那是他圣诞节送给她的项链，周围人们的低语声隐约可闻。  
"Well it's show time"Asuka as willing as ever said. Hikari took Toji arm and headed inside.  
“好了，演出时间到。”明日香一如既往地兴致勃勃说道。光拉着阿薰的手，朝里面走去。  
"Have a good time you two" Misato called before heading off towards NERV and the shift she was going to late for. Asuka grabbed Shinji by the arm and started to lead him inthe direction Hikari and Toji went. As the girls took their coats to the clockroom. Toji and Shinji went and got the drinks. Asuka grabbed all three of them by the arm.  
“你们俩好好玩。”美里喊了一声，便匆匆赶往 NERV，她又要迟到了。明日香抓住真嗣的手臂，带着他朝光和阿薰的方向走去。女孩们把外套拿到寄存处，阿薰和真嗣则去拿饮料。明日香一把抓住他们三个的手臂。  
"It's a party come on lets dance" Excitment and delight could be heard in her voice, as she took to the dance floor. they dance the night away for hours, enjoying the atmosphere and for at least one night both pilots, could put the dread of an Angel attack behing them and be children for that night. Eventually it came to the slow dances. Hikari wrapped her arms round Toji. Asuka walked away from the dance floor. Shinji followed her, he knew this was his moment he had to make the first move.  
“这是派对，快来跳舞吧！”她的声音中充满了兴奋和喜悦，随即踏上了舞池。他们跳了几个小时的舞，享受着氛围，至少在这一晚，两位驾驶员可以将对使徒袭击的恐惧抛诸脑后，像个孩子一样度过这个夜晚。最终，慢舞环节到来。光环抱住阿薰。明日香离开了舞池。真嗣跟在她后面，他知道这是他的机会，他必须迈出第一步。  
"Asuka may I have this dance?"  
"明日香，我可以请你跳这支舞吗？"  
"Why would I want to dance with you" *Come on Asuka just say it, Shinji i'd love to, stupid pride. He'll probably run away now*  
"我为什么要和你跳舞？" *拜托，明日香，直接说吧，真嗣，我很愿意，愚蠢的自尊心。他现在大概要逃走了*  
"I would like to have the last dance with you Asuka"  
"明日香，我想和你跳最后一支舞"  
"No" “不”  
"Wasn't it you who said the world needs to move on. Well it's people that change the world. Asuka whatever it is that has happened let it go. Talk to me I know you can get through this I know that it's hurting you, I will help you. I will always be there, because Asuka I love you" Asuka searched his eyes, he used her words against her, he held out his hand. Hoping she'd take it. * He told me he loved me, Come on Asuka if Shinji can do it then surly you can to* She stood up and looked deep into his eyes, Taking his hand they both took to the dance floor. She wrapped her arms around his neck, Shinji placed his hands on her waist. They gazed into each others eyes. they disappeared into the music. Asuka drew herself closer and resting her head on his chest. The music washed over them no-one else seemed to be around them.  
“不是你说过世界需要前进吗。改变世界的正是人啊。明日香，无论发生了什么，都让它过去吧。跟我谈谈，我知道你能挺过去的，我知道这让你很痛苦，我会帮你。我会一直在你身边，因为明日香，我爱你。”明日香凝视着他的眼睛，他用她的话反驳她，伸出手，希望她能握住。*他告诉我他爱我，来吧明日香，如果真嗣能做到，那你肯定也可以*她站起身，深深地注视着他的眼睛，握住他的手，两人一起走向舞池。她环抱住他的脖子，真嗣将手放在她的腰间。他们凝视着彼此的眼睛，沉浸在音乐中。明日香更靠近了些，将头靠在他的胸前。音乐包围着他们，仿佛周围再无他人。  
"I love you too Shinji" A single tear rolled down her check.  
“我也爱你，真嗣。”一滴泪珠滑过她的脸颊。

Authors note: This is my first fic and I thought a simple but sweet story line was the best option, plus I wrote this while in a two hour Physical chemistry lecture. So I thought that it wasn't a bad attempt. Let me know what you think. Hopefully the next story will be out soon. And it will be better here's hoping  
作者的话：这是我第一篇同人文，我觉得一个简单但温馨的故事线是最好的选择，而且我是在两小时的物理化学课上写的。所以我觉得这尝试还不算坏。请告诉我你的想法。希望下一篇故事很快就能出来。希望会更好，期待着。

Danny: Great story. It was sweet but short. Keep up the good work, and next time do it longer. And also, check for errors, k  
精彩的故事。虽然简短但很甜蜜。继续保持优秀的工作，下次写得更长些。还有，记得检查错误，好吗？

[Black Robed One](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/147928/Black-Robed-One): This was indeed INCREADIBLY sweet and cute story, and I liked it very much! It is one of the few stories, where Shinji grows something, which resemble backbone, without going too much OOC (out of character). You also managed to keep Asuka in character INCREADIBLY well, and I liked that too.  In other words... I LOVED THIS STORY!    
这确实是一个非常甜蜜可爱的故事，我非常喜欢！这是少数几个能让真嗣展现出类似骨气，而又不过于 OOC（脱离角色）的故事之一。你也成功地将明日香保持得非常符合角色，这一点我也很喜欢。换言之...我超爱这篇故事！

[Renegade4](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/318871/Renegade4): Pretty nice, good work. You need to work on some grammar and spelling issues, though. Definitely sort this out for your next fic, as it really makes a huge difference in both the credibility of the fic and how it is received. It's not all that original, either, but I guess that doesn't have to be the point for WAFF, does it? All in all, a decent first fic.  
相当不错，干得好。不过你还需要注意一些语法和拼写问题。务必在下篇作品中解决这些问题，因为它们对作品的可信度和接受度影响极大。此外，内容也并非特别原创，但我想对于温馨轻松文（WAFF）来说，原创性或许并非首要考量，对吧？总的来说，这是一篇不错的处女作。
