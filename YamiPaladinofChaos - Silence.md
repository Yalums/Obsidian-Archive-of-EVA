The cruelty of silence.  
沉默的残酷。

Disclaimer- Nope, I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion, which belongs to Studio Gainax (and probably a bunch of other people).  
免责声明——不，我并不拥有《新世纪福音战士》，它属于 Studio Gainax（以及可能还有其他许多人）。

Odd little thing... grew out of that last sentence Shinji spoke. Ah well. Complaints and threats should go in a review.  
这小东西挺奇怪的...源于真嗣说的最后一句话。唉，有什么不满和威胁请在评论里说吧。

---

Silence. 沉默。

Of all the things he hated about this new world, he hated the silence the most.  
在这个新世界里，他最讨厌的东西中，他最恨的就是这份寂静。

There was a time when he did not mind being alone, even cherished it...  
曾经有一段时间，他并不介意独处，甚至珍视这种时光……

But not this silence. 但不是这种寂静。

This was not the silence of solitude.  
这不是孤独的寂静。

This was the silence of a dead world.  
这是死寂世界的沉默。

Asuka is a little bit away, sleeping for now. He doesn't mind... but the silence... the silence is crushing.  
明日香此刻稍远一些，暂时在沉睡。他并不介意...但那寂静...那寂静令人窒息。

Like the sand in his fingers, faces slip in and out of his mind's eye. Touji, Kensuke, Misato, Hikari, Ritsuko, Ibuki, Aoba, Shigeru, Kaworu, Rei, Father...  
如同指间的沙粒，面孔在他脑海中时隐时现。冬二、真嗣、美里、光、律子、伊吹、青叶、四郎、薰、丽、父亲...

Each of them, gone. 他们每一个人，都已离去。

And he again was the survivor, once more, he stood amidst desolation and death, alive.  
而他再次成为了幸存者，又一次，他站在废墟与死亡之中，活着。

He was dirty... he was a liar, a coward, a weakling... he was a sinner.  
他肮脏... 他是个骗子，懦夫，弱者... 他是个罪人。

On his hands were the deaths of so many.  
他的双手沾满了无数人的死亡。

Rei was forced to sacrifice herself because he was useless.  
丽被迫牺牲自己，因为他无能。

He couldn't save Asuka from the Fifteenth Angel, couldn't protect her from it's violation of the mind.  
他无法从第十五使徒手中救出明日香，无法保护她免受其精神侵犯。

Kaworu forced him to become a murderer, when he, an Angel, was so much better, so pure...  
渚薰逼他成为凶手，而他，身为使徒，却如此优越，如此纯洁...

Misato... who sacrificed herself to give him a chance to save Asuka, and he couldn't even do that right.  
美里...她牺牲了自己，给了他拯救明日香的机会，而他甚至没能正确地做到这一点。

All on him. 全在他身上。

What was that his mother said?  
他母亲那时说了什么？

That happiness can be found anywhere, and anyplace can be heaven?  
幸福无处不在，任何地方都可以是天堂吗？

Anyplace could be Hell as well, he mused darkly, staring at the Eva Series blankly.  
任何地方也可能成为地狱，他阴郁地思索着，茫然地盯着 Eva 系列。

_The Great Third Child... one of the so called defenders of humanity...  
伟大的第三适格者……所谓的守护人类者之一……_

A bitter laugh escaped his lips. He was no defender... he was the reason for the Apocalypse. Because of his weakness, humanity had been forcibly united.  
他苦笑一声。他不是守护者...他是末日的起因。因为他的软弱，人类被迫团结起来。

It was even certain if people would ever return to the Earth.  
甚至不确定人们是否还会回到地球。

Why would they? In Instrumentality, there was no AT field, no wall of hearts...  
他们为何要回来？在人类补完计划中，没有 AT 力场，没有心之壁...

Everyone was one. 每个人都融为一体。

This was his punishment, he knew.  
他知道，这是对他的惩罚。

To be exiled from the rest of humanity... to live in a world of pain and misery and ultimately, death.  
被流放出人类社会……生活在痛苦与悲惨的世界中，最终走向死亡。

In short... to be human.  
简而言之...成为人类。

But why was Asuka here?  
但为什么明日香会在这里？

She had suffered enough... he had wanted to send her back to Instrumentality via death, but something in that touch stopped him, stayed his hands...  
她已经承受了太多...他本想通过死亡将她送回人类补完计划，但那一刻的触碰阻止了他，让他的手停了下来...

Why did she return? 她为何归来？

Was it Eva that protected her, shielded her from being snatched up in the rapture?  
是伊娃保护了她，让她免于被天启所夺？

If it was, then the Evangelion was truly a curse.  
若真是如此，那么福音战士便真是一场诅咒。

Misato's cross dangled on his hand, brushing his chest. Somehow, despite all the insanity of Instrumentality, he had held on to it.  
Misato 的十字架挂在他手上，轻触着他的胸膛。不知怎的，尽管经历了人类补完计划的疯狂，他还是保留着它。

An eternal symbol of what he had lost, what he had failed to protect.  
一个永恒的象征，代表着他所失去的，他所未能保护的。

Inexplicable and irrational anger flared within him, and he almost tossed the silver cross away. Why did he need a tangible reminder?  
一股难以言喻且不合理的愤怒在他心中燃起，他几乎要将那银十字扔掉。为何他需要一个有形的提醒？

The memories in his heart were torture enough.  
他心中的记忆已是足够的折磨。

But he held on to it...  
但他坚持着...

After all, Misato asked him to hold on to it... until she returned.  
毕竟，美里让他坚持住...直到她回来。

Was that why he held it?  
这就是他保留它的原因吗？

For some false hope that the woman who had become a pseudo-older sister to him would return?  
是为了那虚假的希望，期待那位已成为他伪姐姐的女人会回来吗？

Or maybe... 又或许...

Maybe it was a reminder that someday, other's might return to this Hell, this Earth.  
或许这是在提醒他，终有一天，其他人也会重返这片地狱，这个地球。

_As long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth exist... everything will be alright.  
只要太阳、月亮和地球存在……一切都会好起来的。_

Wasn't that what his mother had said?  
这不正是他母亲所说的吗？

Perhaps he had to place his faith in his mother... one last time.  
或许他不得不最后一次相信他的母亲。

A hand was placed on his shoulder, and he turned slowly, glancing at Asuka. Wordlessly, the redhead planted herself on the sand next to him.  
一只手搭在了他的肩膀上，他缓缓转过身，目光落在明日香身上。红发的少女默默地在他旁边的沙滩上坐下。

For a while, neither spoke, simply sitting there...  
一时间，两人都没有说话，只是静静地坐在那里……

In silence. 在沉默中。

Then, at last, Asuka spoke.  
然后，终于，明日香开口了。

"It's quiet..." the words were soft and seemingly insignificant, but held so much resonance.  
“这里很安静……” 这些话轻柔且看似无关紧要，却蕴含着深深的共鸣。

"Yeah." “嗯。”

Silence. 沉默。

The silence of two people.  
两个人的沉默。

Not of death. 并非死亡。

But just... silence. 只是...寂静。

"Well, we'd best get moving Third Child. I'm sick of this view." The Second Child said loudly, a trace of the old Asuka Langley Sohryu returning as she stood. As she began walking off, she turned her head back, glancing at him.  
“好吧，我们最好动身了，三号机驾驶员。这景色我真是看腻了。”二号机驾驶员大声说道，一丝旧日的惣流·明日香·兰格雷的影子在她起身时闪现。她开始走开，又回头瞥了他一眼。

"Are you coming?" “你来吗？”

Should he? 他该来吗？

Did he deserve this? 他配得上这个吗？

"I'll be right there, Asuka." He replied, before glancing back at the LCL sea.  
"我马上就到，明日香。" 他回答道，随后又瞥了一眼 LCL 之海。

All those lost... they were right there, and yet, they were worlds away.  
所有那些逝去的……他们就在那里，却又仿佛远在天边。

Everyone he knew and failed...  
他认识的每一个人，以及辜负的那些……

So many regrets, so many mistakes...  
太多遗憾，太多错误……

"Could we start again... please?"  
“我们能否重新开始……请？”

The LCL waves remained silent as they crashed against the beach.  
LCL 的波浪依旧无声地拍打着沙滩。

And even as he turned away, Shinji Ikari wept.  
即便在他转身离去之际，碇真嗣泪流满面。

故事很有趣，但我不得不承认结局......让我有点困惑。我认为从你的描述来看，是真嗣说了那些最后的话，尽管事实上我并不完全确定。尽管有这个小困惑，我还是很喜欢第一部分，你的描述一如既往地生动，给人一种明确的世界感。

[Linkin-Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/578289/Linkin-Phoenix): This was great, I can't actually remember the last thing Shinji said in EoE I do remember what Asuka said.Another great fic, you have an impressive writing style and I really enjoy your Eva fics.Later,Phoenix
这篇小说很棒，我已经不记得真嗣在《EoE》中说的最后一句话了，但我记得明日香说了什么。又是一篇很棒的小说，你的写作风格令人印象深刻，我非常喜欢你的伊娃小说。
