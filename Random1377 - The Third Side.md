### Side 1 Chemistry
The balding man tilted his chair back and laced his hands behind his head.  "So tell me, Mister Ikari," he said casually, "why should I make _you_ my dishwasher?"  
秃顶的男人将椅子向后倾斜，双手交叉放在脑后。“那么告诉我，碇先生，”他随意地说道，“我为什么要让你成为我的洗碗工呢？”

Shinji Ikari shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  "I'm, umm, a real hard worker," he said hesitantly, "and I'm… I'm good at washing dishes."  
碇真嗣在座位上不安地挪动着。“我，呃，是个非常勤奋的人，”他犹豫地说，“而且我……我擅长洗碗。”

"Washing dishes isn't rocket science, Mister Ikari," the man said blandly, "and my dog works pretty hard too."  As the boy flushed and dropped his eyes, Kenji Arima sighed.  "This is your first interview, isn't it?" he asked, leaning forward once more and rubbing the bridge of his nose in a pained fashion as the boy nodded, "I'll tell you what."  
"洗碗又不是造火箭，碇君，" 那人平淡地说，"我的狗也挺卖力的。" 少年脸红低头，天城贤治叹了口气。"这是你的第一次面试，对吧？" 他问，再次前倾，痛苦地揉着鼻梁，少年点头时，他说："我告诉你。"

"Yes?" Shinji said hopefully, raising his head.  
"是的？" 真嗣满怀希望地抬起头。

"You seem like a nice kid," Kenji said amicably, "and you sounded sincere when you said you work hard.  Sincere is good – I like that."  He smiled. "So I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.  You start tomorrow, three to eight, and if you do a good job in the next week, I'll give you more hours and make you permanent. How does that sound?"  
"你看起来是个好孩子，" 天城友好地说，"而且你说你工作努力时听起来很真诚。真诚很好——我喜欢这样。" 他笑了。"所以我给你一个证明自己的机会。你明天开始，三点到八点，如果你下周表现好，我会给你更多时间并让你成为正式员工。听起来怎么样？"

"Thank you," the brown-haired boy said quickly, "that would be great!"  
“谢谢你，”棕发男孩迅速说道，“那就太好了！”

The restaurant manager chuckled.  "Easy, kid… you'll hurt yourself."  Rising to his feet, he offered his hand.  "See you tomorrow."  
餐厅经理轻声笑道。“别急，孩子……你会伤到自己的。”他站起身来，伸出手。“明天见。”

Shinji shook the man's hand enthusiastically, promising to do his best, and headed out the door, still thanking him.  On the street, he allowed himself a relieved sigh, turning to look back at the Golden Temple.  "Work," he said happily.  
真嗣热情地握了握那人的手，承诺会尽力而为，然后走出门去，依然不停地向他道谢。在街上，他松了一口气，转身回望金阁寺。“工作了，”他开心地说。

Practically glowing, he stepped off the curb and onto the street, sticking his hands into his pockets and heading towards Sadamoto Memorial Hospital, Tokyo-2's best care-giving facility.  Upon arriving, he presented his identification and made his way to the third floor, shaking his head as he entered room 302.  
他几乎是在发光，从人行道踏上街道，双手插进口袋，朝着东京-2 最好的护理机构——佐多摩纪念医院走去。到达后，他出示了身份证件，直奔三楼，进入 302 房间时摇了摇头。

"Hey," he said softly, "Sorry I'm-"  
“嘿，”他轻声说道，“抱歉，我——”

"Late," the room's occupant, Asuka Langley Souryu, cut him off.  "I knew you would be… you're never on time for anything, Third Child."  
“迟到了，”房间里的住客，惣流·明日香·兰格雷打断了他。“我就知道你会……你从来都不准时，第三适格者。”

Shinji blushed.  "Sorry," he reiterated, "I had something I had to do."  
真嗣脸红了。  “对不起，”他再次说道，“我有件事必须去做。”

"More important than me?" the redhead teased, grinning as the boy stammered another apology, "Was it a date?"  
“比我更重要吗？”红发女孩打趣道，笑着看男孩结结巴巴地又道了一次歉，“是去约会吗？”

"N-no!" Shinji exclaimed, "I was just…" he sighed, "I got a part-time job."  
“不——不是！”真嗣大声否认，“我只是……”他叹了口气，“我找了份兼职工作。”

"Why?" Asuka inquired, now confused, "Because all that money the government gave us isn't enough for you?"  
"为什么？" 明日香问道，现在感到困惑，"难道政府给我们的那些钱还不够你用吗？"

The brown-haired boy shook his head.  "No, I just," he bit his bottom lip, sitting in the chair by her bedside, "I needed to have something to do."  
棕发男孩摇了摇头。 "不，我只是，" 他咬了咬下唇，坐在她床边的椅子上，"我需要找点事情做。"

"Got bored playing with yourself?"  
"自己玩腻了？"

Shinji flushed brightly.  "Umm, Hikari said she'd come by tomorrow."  
真嗣的脸一下子红了。“嗯，光说她明天会过来。”

"Fine," the redhead sighed, quickly losing interest in teasing the boy, as he wasn't rising to the bait… so to speak.  "So what's your job?  And won't Touji-wouji miss his little roommate?"  
“好吧，”红发女孩叹了口气，迅速失去了捉弄男孩的兴趣，因为他并没有上钩……这么说吧。“那你的工作是什么？而且，东治不会想念他的小室友吗？”

"I'm going to wash dishes at a restaurant," the former Third Child responded, studying the backs of his hands carefully, "and Touji… he's fine with some time by himself – I think I'm starting to get on his nerves."  
“我会在一家餐厅洗盘子，”前第三适格者回答道，仔细地看着自己的手背，“至于东治……他觉得一个人待会儿挺好的——我想我开始让他有点烦了。”

"I know you got on mine when we lived together, so I'm sure he's going crazy – and he doesn't have…" she trailed off, her diatribe coming to a halt as she whispered, "Misato."  
"我知道我们同居时你上了我的车，所以我敢肯定他快疯了——而且他没有……"她话音渐弱，低声说道："美里。"

There was a long, awkward silence, broken when Shinji rose slowly to his feet.  "I'll still visit every day," he said slowly, fiddling with the rail of her hospital bed, "and I talked to the doctors – they said-"  
一阵漫长而尴尬的沉默后，真嗣缓缓站起身来。"我仍然会每天来看你，"他一边说，一边摆弄着她的病床栏杆，"我和医生谈过了——他们说——"

"Another month or so," the redhead interjected quietly, plucking absently at the front of her hospital gown. "I know."  
"大概再有一个月吧，"红发女孩轻声插话，心不在焉地摆弄着病号服的前襟。"我知道。"

"Yeah, well… feel better."  
“嗯，好吧……感觉好点了。”

Asuka nodded as the boy leaned forward and carefully kissed her forehead.  "I'll try, Shinji," she said softly, closing her eye.  
男孩俯身向前，小心翼翼地吻了她的额头，明日香点头回应。“我会努力的，真嗣，”她轻声说道，闭上了眼睛。

Since 'the return,' as they liked to call it, Shinji and Asuka had developed a rather odd relationship.  Too much had passed between them to ever say they were just friends, and yet, not enough had been said for them to claim that they were more.  Each knew that the other cared, yet neither was willing to probe and find out how deep the feelings went.  Essentially, they had returned to the situation they had been in before the Instrumentality Project, though there were two very important differences – Asuka had admitted that she cared for Shinji, and Shinji had reciprocated.  
自从‘归来’之后，正如他们喜欢称呼的那样，真嗣和明日香发展出了一种相当奇特的关系。太多的过往横亘在他们之间，以至于无法简单地说他们是朋友，然而，又没有足够的坦白让他们宣称彼此更进一步。两人都知道对方关心自己，但谁也不愿意探究这份感情有多深。本质上，他们回到了参与人类补完计划之前的状态，尽管有两个非常重要的不同之处——明日香承认了她对真嗣的关心，而真嗣也给予了回应。

The problem was that admitting that you cared for someone is only a first step, and neither of them knew how to take the next.  
问题在于，承认你在乎某人只是第一步，而他们俩都不知道如何迈出下一步。

Shinji smiled, patting her uninjured arm gently before bidding her farewell and slipping out the door.  As soon as he had gone, Asuka opened her eye, staring at the ceiling with a soft smile as she thought of his next visit.  No matter how tough she looked on the outside, she was still a little girl – a little girl who had lost much of what defined her in one awful stroke.  She had been half blinded, crippled, deformed, nearly killed, and had her purpose – her EVA – stripped from her… all in three minutes and forty-three seconds.  
真嗣微笑着，轻轻拍了拍她未受伤的手臂，然后向她告别，悄悄地离开了房间。他一走，明日香就睁开了眼睛，带着温柔的微笑凝视着天花板，想着他下次来访。无论她外表看起来多么坚强，她仍然是个小女孩——一个在一次可怕的打击中失去了许多自我定义的小女孩。她在三分钟四十三秒内几乎失明、瘫痪、变形、濒临死亡，并且失去了她的使命——她的 EVA——被剥夺了……考虑到这一切，她还能微笑真是令人惊讶。

Taking all of this into consideration, it's a wonder she was able to smile at all.  
考虑到这一切，她还能微笑真是令人惊讶。

**

Shinji spent the rest of the evening and much of the next morning and afternoon… worrying.  He knew he could do a good job (well, thought he could, anyway) but he was edgy about being that close to people he did not know.  _That's why I went for this job, he thought, pulling on a clean pair of jeans and a plain, blue tee shirt, _Misato told me once I should try to be more outgoing.  Well, if I'm washing dishes and constantly bumping into the cooks and the waiters, I won't really have a choice.__  
真嗣在当晚剩下的时间和第二天的大部分时间里...都在担忧。他知道自己能做好这份工作（嗯，至少他是这么认为的），但他对于接近那些不熟悉的人感到紧张。这就是我选择这份工作的原因，他想，穿上一条干净的牛仔裤和一件简单的蓝色 T 恤，美里曾告诉我应该尝试更外向一些。好吧，如果我洗碗时不断撞到厨师和服务员，我真的别无选择。

_

The logic behind the decision did not make him any more enthusiastic about the idea, though, as he was still going to be surrounded by strangers.  Slipping on his shoes, he decided that it would be like his first day of school – only he would be getting paid for it.  The thought of school made him pause, his hand on the doorknob, and glance at his currently napping roommate.  
尽管这个决定背后的逻辑并没有让他对这个想法更感兴趣，因为他仍然会被陌生人包围。穿上鞋子，他决定这会像他第一天上学一样——只是他会因此得到报酬。想到学校，他的手放在门把手上停了下来，瞥了一眼正在打盹的室友。

_Next year,_ he thought, _next year we'll all start high-school together._  
明年，他想，明年我们都会一起开始上高中。

Most of their friends were already attending Tokyo-2 high, but Shinji had chosen to skip freshmen year and enter as a sophomore with Asuka and Touji, after they had recovered.  The UN made sure that there would be no problems in that regard, and had even offered all three remaining Children honorary degrees.  
他们大多数朋友都已就读于东京-2 高中，但真嗣选择了跳过一年级，与康复后的明日香和冬二一同作为二年级生入学。联合国确保了这方面不会出现问题，甚至向三位幸存的孩子们提供了荣誉学位。

Asuka had refused on the grounds that she already had a degree from the Institute of Berlin, and was only interested in the social aspects of school – and furthermore, she might drop out after junior year to pursue a career, as after that she would have a firm enough grasp of Kanji and Japanese customs to make it in the private sector.    
明日香拒绝了，理由是她已拥有柏林学院的学位，只对学校的社交方面感兴趣——而且，她可能在高中三年级后退学追求职业生涯，因为届时她将牢固掌握汉字和日本习俗，足以在私营部门立足。

Touji had almost accepted.  Then his friend Kensuke Aida pointed out that this would mean he would spend the next three years friendless (because HE wouldn't visit) and dateless – because he would make sure that Touji's current love interest found out about the 'Creamed Corn' incident.  Touji quickly agreed that maybe school wasn't so bad after all.  
冬二差点接受了。然后他的朋友相田剑介指出，这意味着他将在接下来的三年里没有朋友（因为他不会去拜访），也没有约会——因为他会确保冬二目前的恋爱对象得知‘奶油玉米’事件。冬二迅速同意，或许学校也没那么糟糕。

As for Shinji, he simply wanted to make it on his own, without having anything handed to him or receiving any special favors for being a former pilot – especially for being a former pilot.  
至于真嗣，他只是想靠自己立足，不想因为曾是驾驶员而得到任何特殊待遇或优待——尤其是作为前驾驶员。

"See ya later," he mumbled, shaking his head as the former Fourth Child rolled over on the couch, reaching out blindly for the television remote.  
“回头见。”他咕哝着，摇了摇头，只见前第四适格者翻身躺在沙发上，伸手盲目地摸索着电视遥控器。

Stepping out of the building, Shinji quickly walked the two blocks to the train station, barely catching the 2:06.  He had deliberately chosen a restaurant on the far side of town, thinking: if you're going to get out of the house, why not get _out of the house_?  The rail system being what it was, he reached his destination in a little under forty-two minutes, smiling as he walked in twelve minutes early.  
走出大楼，真嗣快步穿过两个街区来到火车站，刚好赶上 2 点 06 分的列车。他特意选择了一家位于城市另一端的餐厅，心想：既然要出门，何不彻底离开家呢？得益于现有的铁路系统，他在不到四十二分钟的时间内到达了目的地，微笑着提前十二分钟走进餐厅。

_Now then 那么现在_

Looking around the spacious dining room, he spied a young girl in the restaurant's uniform, diligently wiping down one of the tables.  He raised his hand.  "Umm, excuse me."  
环顾宽敞的餐厅，他注意到一个穿着餐厅制服的年轻女孩，正认真地擦拭着一张桌子。他举起手，"呃，打扰一下。"

"Can I help you, sir?" the girl asked cheerfully, setting the rag to the side and approaching him.  
“先生，有什么可以帮您的吗？”女孩愉快地问道，将抹布放在一旁，向他走来。

"I'm… supposed to start today," the former Third Child said hesitantly.  
“我……应该从今天开始，”前第三适格者犹豫地说道。

"You must be Shinji," the girl said, smiling kindly as she untied her apron and set it on the back of the closest booth, "I'm Sachiko, Sachiko Nataka.  Come on."  She turned away, gesturing for him to follow.  
“你一定是真嗣吧，”女孩微笑着亲切地说，解下围裙并将其搭在最近的座位背上，“我是娜塔佳·幸子。来吧。”她转身示意他跟上。

The brown-haired boy started walking, looking her over as she headed towards the back of the restaurant.  He guessed (correctly) that she was seventeen.  Her glasses framed light hazel eyes, and her shoulder-length black hair was tied back with a simple, green ribbon.  His first impression was that she wasn't a knockout, but she was attractive, and more importantly, she was polite and warm, two qualities that Shinji found incredibly appealing.  
棕色头发的男孩开始走动，随着她向餐厅后方走去，他打量着她。他猜测（猜对了）她十七岁。她的眼镜框住了浅褐色的眼睛，肩上的黑色短发用一条简单的绿色丝带扎着。他的第一印象是她并非惊艳型，但她很有魅力，更重要的是，她礼貌而热情，这两种品质让真嗣觉得非常吸引人。

"Where are you from?" Sachiko asked as she pushed the kitchen door open, "You don't sound like you're from around here."  
"你来自哪里？" 幸子推开厨房门问道，"你听起来不像是本地人。"

"I used to live in Tokyo-3," Shinji replied, looking around in wonder as the quiet of the dining area gave way to the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, "before…" he flushed slightly, "before."  
"我以前住在东京-3，" 真嗣回答，好奇地环顾四周，餐厅的宁静被厨房的喧嚣所取代，"在那之前…" 他微微脸红，"在那之前。"

"Ahh," the dark-haired girl said, nodding slowly, "I'm sorry."  
"啊，" 黑发女孩缓缓点头，"我很抱歉。"

"It's not your fault," the boy answered with a shrug, "at least I got out."  
"这不是你的错，"男孩耸耸肩回答，"至少我逃出来了。"

"And if you hadn't," Sachiko pointed out, "we wouldn't be having this conversation."  
"如果你没逃出来，"幸子指出，"我们就不会有这场对话了。"

Shinji blinked, thinking that this was an odd statement.  Before he could comment on it, another girl approached them.  "Careful," she said with a grin, "Sachiko's got some strange ideas.  Hi," she stuck out her hand, "I'm Mizuki, nice to meet you."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，觉得这话很奇怪。他还没来得及评论，另一个女孩就向他们走来了。"小心点，"她笑着说，"幸子有些奇怪的想法。嗨，"她伸出手，"我是瑞希，很高兴见到你。"

As Shinji shook the other girl's offered hand, Sachiko stuck out her tongue.  "Mizuki thinks just because she's two whole years older that she has the wisdom of the ages," she said sarcastically, "but what she can't explain is why her infinite wisdom slipped and got her married so young – and just finished getting her a divorce."  
当真嗣摇晃着另一位女孩伸出的手时，幸子吐了吐舌头。“瑞希觉得就因为她比我们大两岁，就拥有了古老的智慧，”她讽刺地说，“但她解释不了的是，为什么她的无限智慧会让她这么年轻就结婚——而且刚刚还离了婚。”

"I'm sure he didn't want to know that," Mizuki said darkly, "I swear – you should learn what the word 'tact' means."  
“我肯定他不想知道这些，”瑞希阴沉地说，“我发誓——你应该学会‘机智’这个词的意思。”

"Oh, I know what it means," the dark-haired girl said happily, "I just don't feel the need to use it with you, Takiama."  
“哦，我知道它是什么意思，”黑发女孩开心地说，“我只是觉得没必要对你用，泷山。”

"Thanks," Mizuki said dryly.  
"谢谢," 水月干巴巴地说道。

Shinji stared at her curiously, trying to determine what color her hair was, but since it was covered by a large, red bandana, he could not quite tell.  He did notice that her eyes were a vibrant green, though.  
真嗣好奇地盯着她，试图判断她的头发是什么颜色，但由于被一条大红色头巾遮住了，他无法确定。不过，他确实注意到她的眼睛是鲜绿色的。

Sachiko noticed him staring and tapped his arm discretely, waiting until he looked at her to shake her head slightly.  "Come on," she said lightly as he looked confused, "over here.  Later, Mitzu."  
幸子注意到他在盯着看，便轻轻地拍了拍他的手臂，等他看向她时微微摇头。"过来，"她轻声说道，看着他一脸困惑，"这边。待会儿见，Mitzu。"

"See ya," the other girl replied, "and don't hog the newbie all day!"  
"再见," 另一个女孩回答道, "别霸占新人一整天哦！"

Shinji blushed as he was led to the back of the kitchen.  "Sorry," he murmured once they were out of earshot, "I didn't mean to stare."  
被带到厨房后部的真嗣脸红了。  "对不起," 他们听不见后他小声说道, "我不是故意盯着看的。"

"It's ok," Sachiko said soothingly, "she's just kinda sensitive about it.  She thinks people are always looking at her – and if they don't know her, they are… it's only natural – people are curious, you know?"  She shrugged, "But you're gonna be working here, and it'll be awkward if you-"  
"没关系," 幸子安慰地说, "她只是对此有点敏感。 她觉得人们总是在看她——如果他们不认识她，确实会这样……这是很自然的——人们都有好奇心，你知道吗？" 她耸了耸肩，"但你以后要在这里工作，如果你一直这样，会显得很尴尬——"

"This is my new help?"  
"这就是我的新帮手？"

Shinji turned to find a middle-aged man with blonde hair looking him up and down. "H-hello," he stammered, unnerved by the man's deep blue eyes. Like Asuka's, he thought suddenly.  
真嗣转过身，发现一个金发的中年男子正上下打量着他。“你、你好，”他结巴道，被那人深蓝色的眼睛盯得有些不安。他突然想到，这眼神和明日香的很像。

"Alexander Davies," the man said, offering his hand, "I'm the head cook here.  You're Shinji, right?"  
"亚历山大·戴维斯，"那人伸出手说，"我是这里的厨师长。你是真嗣，对吧？"

"Yes sir," the former Third Child answered, wincing slightly as the man firmly gripped his hand, "Nice to meet you, Mister Davies."  
“是的，先生，”前第三子回答道，当那人紧紧握住他的手时，他微微皱眉，“很高兴见到你，戴维斯先生。”

Alexander grinned.  "Good," he said, his tone indicating satisfaction, "you already know how to address me."  
亚历山大咧嘴一笑。“很好，”他说，语气中透露出满意，“你已经知道怎么称呼我了。”

Sachiko snorted.  "Alex's American – so he's got a pretty high opinion of himself," she muttered, amused, "and he likes to talk tough, but he's really a big softy."  As the man frowned, Sachiko added, "Remind me later and I'll tell you about the time we all went to see-"  
幸子哼了一声。“亚历克斯是美国人——所以他对自己评价很高，”她低声笑着说，“而且他喜欢说大话，但实际上他是个大软心肠。”看到那人皱眉，幸子补充道，“提醒我待会儿告诉你我们去看的那次……”

"SO!" Alexander interrupted, grabbing Shinji's arm and yanking him away from the girl, "You'll probably want to get started."  He glared at Sachiko, who was laughing with delight.  "You, I'll talk to later!"  
"好了！" 亚历山大打断道，抓住真嗣的手臂将他从女孩身边拉开，"你大概想开始了吧。" 他瞪着笑得开心的幸子，"你，我待会儿再跟你谈！"

"Don't let him fool you, Shinji," the girl said with wink, "but do try to do what he says… he's been in the business a long time, and he knows everything."  She grinned, "Plus he's part-owner of this place, and the one who decides if you stay."  
"别被他骗了，真嗣，" 女孩眨眼说道，"不过还是尽量照他说的做……他在这个行业很久了，什么都懂。" 她咧嘴一笑，"而且他还是这里的部分老板，决定你是否能留下的人。"

Shinji swallowed, taking another look at the man.  "Umm, what should I do first… Mister Davies…?"  
真嗣咽了咽口水，又看了看那个男人。"嗯，我应该先做什么……戴维斯先生……？"

Alexander grinned triumphantly at Sachiko, but she only laughed harder.  "First things first…"  
亚历山大得意地对幸子咧嘴一笑，但她笑得更欢了。“先说重要的……”

As he was shown where everything was, Shinji nodded, making sure to memorize the locations of all the essentials.  Cleanser, towels, drying rack, hot and cold tap – he wanted to make sure that he did this right, not because very much was riding on it, but because he was tired of making mistakes.  
当被告知所有物品的位置时，真嗣点头，确保记住所有必需品的位置。清洁剂、毛巾、晾衣架、冷热水龙头——他想确保自己做得对，不是因为这件事有多重要，而是因为他厌倦了犯错。

Sachiko watched for several minutes, then headed back towards her station, wondering idly if the boy would make it past the first week.  He seemed smart enough, but washing was a lot harder than people thought.  His hands would be in a constant state of either prune-like sogginess or cracked dryness from the water washing away the essential oils that his skin produced.  Plus the fact that he would be on his feet almost the entire time, with only one ten-minute break.  
幸子观察了几分钟，然后朝自己的岗位走去，漫不经心地想着这个男孩能否撑过第一周。他看起来挺聪明，但洗衣服比人们想象的要难得多。他的手会一直处于皱巴巴的湿漉或因水分洗掉皮肤产生的必需油脂而干裂的状态。再加上他几乎要一直站着，只有一次十分钟的休息时间。

"Good luck, Shinji," she muttered, tying her apron back on, "I think… you might just need it."  
"祝你好运，真嗣，"她喃喃自语，重新系上围裙，"我觉得……你可能真的需要它。"

**

Three weeks.  That's how long it took Shinji to grow comfortable in his job.  The first week was spent in getting familiarized with his workstation and where everything went, and (much to his great pleasure) becoming a permanent employee. The other two were spent growing slowly more familiar with his coworkers.  Sachiko, he found, had a boyfriend of a year and a half named Domiyoji Miyazawa, and was very much in love with him.  He learned that Alexander was married and had two children, and was both a loving father… and a demanding taskmaster.  And he discovered that Mitzuki had been married for six months before filing for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.  
三周。这就是真嗣适应新工作所花的时间。第一周用来熟悉工作台和各种物品的位置，以及（令他非常高兴的是）成为一名正式员工。接下来的两周，他逐渐与同事们熟悉起来。他发现幸子有一个交往了一年半的男友，名叫道明寺宫泽，她深爱着他。他了解到亚历山大已婚并有两个孩子，既是一位慈爱的父亲……也是一位苛刻的监工。他还发现光月结婚六个月后便申请离婚，理由是不可调和的分歧。

The other waiters and waitresses rarely talked to Shinji, so he did not have a chance to form an opinion of them.  They were always polite, but distant.  He suspected (and rightly so, in some cases) that they considered him an inferior form of life.  
其他的服务员很少与真嗣交谈，所以他也没有机会对他们形成看法。他们总是礼貌但疏远。他怀疑（在某些情况下确实如此）他们认为他是一种低等生物。

One evening as he was just finishing up, Sachiko came into the kitchen, walking straight up to him and waiting until he looked up before speaking.  "Shinji?" she asked hesitantly, "can you, umm… walk me home?  Domiyoji had to work late, and Mitzuki's already gone."  
一天傍晚，他刚忙完手头的工作，幸子走进了厨房，径直走到他面前，直到他抬头才开口。“真嗣？”她犹豫地问道，“你能，呃……送我回家吗？道明寺今晚加班，光已经先走了。”

"I'm… not very safe," the brown-haired boy said slowly, blushing as he quickly added, "I mean, I probably wouldn't do much good if something happened."  
“我……不太安全，”棕发男孩缓缓说道，脸红着迅速补充，“我是说，如果真有什么事，我可能帮不上什么忙。”

The waitress smiled faintly.  "I think just having you with me would make me less appealing to any undesirables that might be lurking about," she grinned, "Of course, nothing you can do can protect me against Alexander, because-"  
女服务员微微一笑。“我觉得有你在身边，会让那些不怀好意的人对我没那么感兴趣，”她笑着说，“当然，你做什么都保护不了我免受亚历山大的伤害，因为——”

"I can hear you," the blonde man muttered, poking his face through the double doors leading to the dining area, "this is plastic, not lead!"  
"我能听见你，"金发男子嘟囔着，把脸探进通往餐厅的双开门，"这是塑料，不是铅！"

"I know," Sachiko winked.  
"我知道，"幸子眨了眨眼。

Mumbling something about her being young enough to be his daughter, and snotty enough to be his wife's, the cook ducked back into the other room to finish his conversation with Kenji.  
他咕哝着说她年轻得可以当他女儿，又傲慢得像他老婆，厨师缩回另一间房继续和健二交谈。

"So," the waitress said with a smile, "will you?"  
"那么，" 女服务员微笑着说，"你会吗？"

Shinji wiped his hands on his dishrag and placed it carefully on the sink.  "Ok," he said quietly, "let me just call my roommate, and tell him I'll-"  
真嗣用抹布擦了擦手，小心翼翼地把它放在水槽边。  "好的，" 他轻声说，"让我先给室友打个电话，告诉他我会-"

"You can say Touji," Sachiko laughed, "I know you, Shinji."  
"你可以直接说'Toji'，" 幸子笑着说，"我认识你，真嗣。"

Oddly, her light assurance didn't sit so well with the boy.  I don't think anyone does, he thought, frowning slightly as he called home, maybe Misato did.  
奇怪的是，她轻描淡写的安慰并没有让男孩感到舒心。我想没人能做到吧，他想着，微微皱眉地打电话回家，或许美里小姐可以。

The young woman waited while Shinji informed his friend that he would be a bit late, smiling as he stammered a denial, obviously being teased.  "All set?" she asked, cocking her head to one side and smiling as he hung up.  
年轻女子等待着真嗣告知朋友他会晚点到，微笑着看他结结巴巴地否认，显然是被调侃了。“都好了吗？”她问，歪着头微笑着看他挂断电话。

Since he was, they headed out into the warm night.  The walk was quiet and pleasant, and for its duration, Sachiko asked Shinji all about his life, finding the topic of Asuka greatly interesting.  
既然他准备好了，他们便走进温暖的夜晚。散步安静而愉快，期间幸子询问了真嗣许多关于他生活的事情，对明日香的话题尤为感兴趣。

"I guess I'm kinda clingy," the boy shrugged as they walked, "I just… she's one of the only friends I have left."  
"我想我有点黏人，"男孩耸耸肩，和他们一起走着，"我只是……她是我仅剩的朋友之一了。"

"I think it's cute," Sachiko said, nudging him in the ribs, "the gallant knight, vigilantly watching over his fallen love."  
"我觉得很可爱，"幸子说着，轻轻撞了一下他的肋骨，"那位英勇的骑士，时刻守护着他心爱的姑娘。"

Shinji blushed.  "She's not exactly my love," he said softly, looking down at his feet, "I mean, I like her, but we've… never really been very close.  Emotionally, I mean."  
真嗣脸红了。"她并不是我的爱人，"他轻声说，低头看着自己的脚，"我是说，我喜欢她，但我们……从来没有真正亲近过。我是说，情感上。"

"This is my place," the black-haired girl said suddenly, "thanks, Shinji."  
"这里是我的地盘，"黑发女孩突然说道，"谢谢你，真嗣。"

Shinji nodded, relieved that the subject had been dropped.  He still wasn't quite sure what Asuka was to him.  Things had certainly gotten better between them, and he thought Asuka liked him somewhat, though just how much he did not know.  He also had a sinking suspicion that he loved her – but every time the thought came up, he pushed it aside, unable to deal with the emotions that the idea drew forth.  
真嗣点点头，庆幸这个话题终于结束了。他仍然不太确定明日香对他意味着什么。他们之间的关系确实有所改善，他认为明日香对他有些好感，尽管他并不清楚具体有多少。他还隐约觉得他爱她——但每次这个念头冒出来，他都将其推开，无法面对由此引发的情感。

"Wanna come in for a sec?"  
"想进来坐一会儿吗？"

"Hmm?" Shinji blinked, "Into your house?"  
"嗯？" 真嗣眨了眨眼，"进你家？"

"No," Sachiko replied immediately, jerking a thumb over her shoulder, "into my dumpster – it's cozy back there, and the smell reminds me of work."  She rolled her eyes as the boy gaped at her, "Yes, Shinji… into my house."  When he just stared, she sighed, grabbing his hand.   
"不，" 幸子立刻回答，用拇指指了指身后，"进我的垃圾桶——那里很舒适，而且气味让我想起工作。" 她翻了个白眼，看着男孩目瞪口呆的样子，"是的，真嗣……进我家。" 当他只是呆呆地看着时，她叹了口气，抓住了他的手。

"Come on." "来吧。"

The brown-haired boy let himself be led in, wondering what she wanted from him.  Once inside, he looked around.  "Very nice," he commented, "I like it."  
棕发男孩任由她领着走进去，心中好奇她想要从他这里得到什么。一进门，他环顾四周。“非常不错，”他评论道，“我很喜欢。”

"Thanks," the waitress replied, taking off her sweater, "Domiyoji helped me set it all up, he's really good at stuff like that – very creative.  I think you'd like him."  
“谢谢，”女服务员脱下毛衣，回答道，“道明寺帮我布置的，他在这方面真的很擅长——非常有创意。我想你会喜欢他的。”

Shinji relaxed a bit more as she mentioned her boyfriend.  What were you thinking about? his mind teased, Asuka's right… you ARE a pervert.  
听到她提起她的男朋友，真嗣稍微放松了一些。你在想什么呢？他的内心自嘲道，明日香说得对……你真是个变态。

"Have a seat," Sachiko said, gesturing to the couch, "I'm gonna change real fast."  
“请坐，”幸子说道，示意他坐在沙发上，“我去换件衣服，很快就好。”

"Wait, umm," the boy blushed as the girl paused, turning back to face him with a questioning look on her face, "I should get going… shouldn't I?"  
“等等，呃，”男孩脸红了，女孩停下脚步，转过身来，脸上带着询问的表情，“我是不是该走了…对吧？”

Sachiko blinked.  "Well, if you want to," she said with a shrug, "I just thought maybe you'd like to hang out and talk for a while.  You do know how to talk, right?"  As the boy blushed, she giggled.  "You need to loosen up, Shinji," she said, heading for the door, "you're too tense.  Sit tight, I'll be right back."  
幸子眨了眨眼。“嗯，如果你想走的话，”她耸耸肩说，“我只是觉得也许你想留下来聊一会儿。你会聊天的，对吧？”男孩脸红时，她咯咯笑了起来。“你需要放松点，真嗣，”她说着朝门口走去，“你太紧张了。坐着别动，我马上回来。”

Shinji tried to relax while she was gone, looking around the living room of the small house.  "You live here alone?" he called, unable to stand simply waiting.  
她离开后，真嗣试图放松，环顾着这个小房子的客厅。“你一个人住吗？”他忍不住问道，无法忍受只是干等着。

His eyes lighted on an electronic keyboard as her answer floated to him through the door, "No, I have a roommate, but she works opposite shifts from me, so I hardly ever see her."  A moment later, she opened the door, coming back into the room with two cans of soda.  "We probably just missed her," she said with a shrug, offering him one, "just as well – she'd probably grill you until you wanted to scream.  She's really nice, but very, very nosy."  
他的目光落在了一台电子键盘上，她的回答从门后飘来，“不，我有个室友，但她和我轮班时间相反，所以我几乎见不到她。”片刻后，她打开门，拿着两罐汽水回到房间。“我们可能刚好错过了她，”她耸耸肩，递给他一罐，“这样也好——她可能会把你问到想尖叫。她人很好，但非常非常爱打听。”

"You play?" Shinji asked, taking the can and nodding to the keyboard.  
“你会弹吗？”真嗣接过罐子，向键盘点了点头问道。

"No," Sachiko replied, sitting down on the couch – but taking the cushion furthest from him (to avoid giving the wrong idea), "that's Tsuzuki's.  I play the flute."  She popped the top on her drink and leaned back, further distancing herself from him, "What about you?"  
“不，”幸子回答，坐在沙发上——但选择了离他最远的靠垫（以免引起误会），“那是都筑的。我吹长笛。”她打开饮料，向后靠了靠，进一步远离他，“你呢？”

Shinji boy opened his own drink, looking at her out of the corner of his eyes before answering, "I play the cello, but my roomma-, er Touji hates it, so I don't get much chance to practice.  He's home a lot."  He swallowed, looking away.  She looks different, he thought, fighting the urge to look again.  
真嗣打开自己的饮料，用眼角余光打量着她，然后回答：“我拉大提琴，但我室友，呃，东治讨厌它，所以我很少有机会练习。他经常在家。”他咽了咽口水，移开视线。她看起来不一样了，他想，强忍着再次看她的冲动。

Indeed, in jeans and a loose-fitting tee shirt, Sachiko looked far different from the way he was used to seeing her – especially since she had untied the ever-present green ribbon and let her hair down so it could brush the tops of her shoulders.  She had also taken off her glasses, reminding Shinji that she wasn't blind, just a bit nearsighted.  
确实，穿着牛仔裤和宽松 T 恤的幸子，与他习惯见到的样子大相径庭——尤其是她解开了那条总是系着的绿色发带，让头发披散下来，轻拂着肩头。她还摘掉了眼镜，这让真嗣想起她并非盲人，只是有点近视。

"I always wanted to take a stringed instrument," the girl said, taking another drink and leaning forward to set her can on the small coffee table by the couch, "but I could never… something wrong?"  
"我一直想学一种弦乐器，"女孩说道，又喝了一口，然后向前倾身，将她的罐子放在沙发旁的小咖啡桌上，"但我总是……有什么不对劲吗？"

Shinji was sitting stock still, staring straight ahead.  "N-nothing," he managed, wondering just how red his cheeks were.  
真嗣一动不动地坐着，直直地盯着前方。"没、没什么，"他勉强应道，不知道自己的脸颊有多红。

The nature of man being what it is, Shinji had been unable to resist the temptation to glance towards Sachiko as she leaned forward, and he had found – much to his combined interest and embarrassment – that she had not been wearing a bra.  He shook his head, trying unsuccessfully to rid himself of the almost burning image of her bare breast – the left, his mind insisted on noting.  
人的本性使然，真嗣无法抗拒诱惑，当幸子俯身时，他忍不住瞥了一眼，结果既感兴趣又尴尬地发现她没有穿胸罩。他摇了摇头，试图摆脱那几乎灼烧般的她裸露的左胸的画面，但未能成功。

Small, he thought, glancing at her from the corner of his eyes, she must wear a padded – ahh!! What am I thinking?!  
"小巧，他想，用眼角余光瞥了她一眼，她一定穿了棉袄——啊哈！！我在想什么？！”

"You ok?" Sachiko asked, frowning, "You look kinda pale."  
“你还好吗？”幸子皱着眉问，“你看起来有点苍白。”

"Yeah," Shinji said, "just… it's nothing, I just realized how late it is, I should-"  
“嗯，”真嗣说，“只是……没什么，我只是意识到时间有多晚了，我应该——”

"Oh, don't start that 'I've gotta get going,' crap again," she cut in, blowing out a breath and making her bangs dance, "I'm not gonna bite you, I just wanna talk… get to know you a bit better."  
"哦，别再扯什么'我得走了'的鬼话了，"她打断道，呼出一口气让刘海跳动，"我不会咬你的，我只是想聊聊……更好地了解你一些。"

"Get to know me?" the boy asked, still trying to fend off the images of her soft-looking skin, "How come?"  
"了解我？"男孩问道，仍在试图摆脱她那看起来柔软肌肤的影像，"为什么？"

"Well, I…" the black-haired girl blushed faintly, "Ok, ok – I promised someone up at work that I would find out about you."  She shrugged as his jaw dropped, "I told her I'm not so good at quizzing people, but she made me promise.  Sorry."  
"嗯，我……"黑发女孩微微脸红，"好吧，好吧——我在工作上答应了一个人要打听你的事。"她耸耸肩，看着他的下巴惊得掉下来，"我跟她说我不太擅长盘问别人，但她非要我答应。对不起。"

"It's ok," Shinji said quietly, staring at his untouched drink, "but who-"  
"没事的，" 真嗣轻声说道，盯着他未曾动过的饮料，"但谁-"

"Uh-uh," Sachiko cut him off, grinning, "that I can't tell you."  
"不行，" 幸子打断了他，咧嘴笑道，"这个我不能告诉你。"

Why? he thought immediately, wondering why someone would ask about him.  
为什么？他立刻想到，想知道为什么会有人问起他。

The girl stretched, not noticing the brown-haired boy's sudden tension as the movement caused her chest to press up against her shirt, clearly outlining what he had already seen.  "Mm," she hummed, "now that you know, can I just ask questions outright instead of trying to work them into the conversation?"  
女孩伸了个懒腰，没注意到棕发男孩因她的动作而突然紧张起来，她的胸部紧贴着衬衫，清晰地勾勒出了他已经见过的轮廓。“嗯，”她哼了一声，“既然你已经知道了，那我可以直接问问题，不用再试图把它们塞进对话里了吗？”

Shinji blinked.  "Umm," he finally took a drink of his soda, "sure," he said, setting it down next to hers, "go ahead."  Dummy, he thought, you thought SHE wanted to know, didn't you? You are so stupid – and even if it WAS her that wanted to know, what would you do about it? She's got a boyfriend – and Asuka…  
真嗣眨了眨眼。“呃，”他终于喝了一口汽水，“当然，”他说着，把它放在她的旁边，“问吧。”笨蛋，他想，你以为她想知道，对吧？你真是太蠢了——即使真的是她想知道，你又能怎么办呢？她有男朋友——还有明日香……

His thoughts trailed off as Sachiko went straight to the point.  "You seeing anyone?  I know you have the girl in the hospital, but you said she wasn't your girlfriend and you weren't emotionally close to her."  She grinned, "So are you just fucking her or what?"  
他的思绪随着幸子直截了当的问题而中断。“你有在和谁交往吗？我知道你在医院有个女孩，但你说过她不是你的女朋友，你们感情也不深。”她咧嘴一笑，“所以你只是在和她上床还是怎么的？”

Shinji flushed.  "N-no."  
真嗣脸红了。  "不-不是的。"

"Yeah," the waitress said, nodding, "didn't really think so.  Sorry to say this, Shinji, but I'm guessing you've never done it, am I right?  And you don't have a girlfriend at all, do you?"  
"是啊，"女服务员点点头，"确实没这么想。真嗣，抱歉这么说，但我猜你从来没做过，对吧？而且你根本就没有女朋友，对不对？"

The former Third Child sat silent for a long moment.  Well, he mused, I DID say she could go ahead and ask.  Finally, he sighed.  "No," he murmured, smiling faintly as he remembered a conversation he had had some time back, "I'm not too adept at, umm…"  
前第三适格者沉默了很久。嗯，他想，我确实说过她可以尽管问。最后，他叹了口气。"没有，"他低声说，想起不久前的一次对话，嘴角泛起一丝淡淡的微笑，"我不太擅长，呃……"

"At what?" "什么？"

Shinji's voice was low as he replied,  
真嗣低声回答道，

"Living." "活着。"

Sachiko blinked, entirely confused.  
幸子眨了眨眼，完全摸不着头脑。

"I need to go," the brown-haired boy said quietly, "thanks for the drink."  
"我得走了，" 棕发男孩轻声说道，"谢谢你的饮料。"

The black-haired girl got to her feet, leaning over him and putting her hands on his shoulders. "Wait!" she said quickly, running her tongue over her lips as she considered what to say.  "Don't leave, ok?  I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I just… I don't know how to talk to people sometimes, and I just go for it, you know?  I didn't mean to offend you."  
黑发女孩站起身来，俯身靠近他，双手搭在他的肩上。"等等！"她急忙说道，舌头舔过嘴唇，思考着该说什么。"别走，好吗？如果我让你感到不舒服，我很抱歉，我只是……有时候我不知道怎么和人交流，就直来直去了，你知道吗？我不是有意冒犯你的。"

Shinji forced himself to meet her eyes, trying to keep from looking down as he replied, "No, its ok, I just… I don't know how to talk to people either."  
真嗣强迫自己直视她的眼睛，尽量不让自己低头，回答道：“不，没关系，我只是……我也不太会和人交流。”

Sachiko slowly straightened.  "Will you stay?" she asked softly, "I won't say anything stupid."  She smiled suddenly, "Well… I'll try not to.  But I would like to hear more about you."  
幸子缓缓挺直身子。“你会留下来吗？”她轻声问道，“我不会说蠢话的。”她突然笑了，“嗯……我会尽量不说。但我很想多了解你一些。”

The brown-haired boy stared at his drink for a minute before nodding.  "Yeah," he said, trying to relax, "sorry I freaked out."  
棕色头发的男孩盯着他的饮料看了一会儿，然后点点头。“嗯，”他说，试图放松，“抱歉我刚才反应过度了。”

The waitress sank back down on the couch, sighing thankfully.  "It's me;" she said ruefully, "like Mitzu said the day you started – no tact… no tact at all."  
女服务员感激地叹了口气，又坐回沙发上。“是我；”她自嘲地说，“就像你开始工作那天 Mitzu 说的——毫无机智……一点儿也没有。”

An awkward silence fell.  Abruptly, they both reached for their sodas, their hands finding each other instead.  They looked down, then at one another, their eyes wide and startled at the unexpected contact.  
一阵尴尬的沉默降临。突然间，两人都伸手去拿汽水，手却意外地碰到了一起。他们低头看了看，然后对视一眼，眼中满是惊讶和慌张。

Abruptly, they both laughed.  
突然，他们都笑了起来。

"I… I just thought of this old movie I saw," Sachiko giggled, "same thing happened in it, too!  But then they started kissing – and taking their clothes off!"  She blushed as she laughed, "I think they spilled the soda – while they were having sex on the table!"  
"我…我只是想起了我看过的一部老电影，" 幸子咯咯笑道，"里面也发生了同样的事情！但他们后来开始接吻——还脱掉了衣服！" 她笑着脸红了，"我想他们在桌子上做爱的时候把汽水洒了！"

Shinji's laughter intensified. "I think… I think I saw that one too!" he managed, "Oh… oh, man!  I haven't laughed this hard since Misato tickled me one day!"  
真嗣的笑声更加响亮。"我想…我想我也看过那部电影！" 他勉强说道，"哦…哦，天哪！我自从美里有一天挠我痒痒以来，还没这么笑过呢！"

The black-haired girl's eyes narrowed and a wicked grin spread over her features.  "Ticklish, are you?" she laughed, "Oh you are so in trouble now!!"  
黑发女孩的眼睛眯了起来，脸上露出了一个邪恶的笑容。"怕痒，是吗？" 她笑道，"哦，你现在可有大麻烦了！！"

Shinji's eyes widened as Sachiko suddenly swung one leg over him, pinning him to the couch.  "What are you-hahahahaah!!"  
真嗣的眼睛瞪大了，因为幸子突然跨过他的身体，将他压在沙发上。“你这是要-哈哈哈哈哈！！”

His startled reaction was cut off as the girl dug her fingers into his ribcage, wriggling them unmercifully.  "You fool!!" she shrieked, "You revealed your weakness – and now you're mine! Wahahahahah!!"   
他的惊慌反应被女孩的手指戳进肋骨打断，她无情地扭动着手指。“你这个笨蛋！！”她尖叫道，“你暴露了你的弱点——现在你是我的了！哇哈哈哈哈哈！！”

"Stop! Stop!!" Shinji begged, struggling to fight, but finding himself totally immobilized.  
“停下！停下！！”真嗣恳求道，挣扎着想要反抗，却发现自己的身体完全动弹不得。

As gales of laughter filled the apartment, Sachiko smiled. At work he's always so serious, she thought, but when he laughs, he sounds just like Domiyoji.  Still laughing, she tickled him harder, keeping his arms firmly in place with her knees.  "You belong to me!" she shouted gleefully, "Tell me!  Tell me you're mine!  Tell me I own you, slave!!"  
公寓里笑声如风般回荡，Sachiko 微笑着。在工作中他总是那么严肃，她想，但当他笑起来时，声音就像道明寺一样。她一边笑着，一边更加用力地挠他痒，用膝盖牢牢固定住他的手臂。“你属于我！”她欢快地喊道，“告诉我！告诉我你是我的！告诉我我拥有你，奴隶！！”

"Ok!!" Shinji panted, "You win!  You own me!!"  
“好！！”Shinji 喘着气说，“你赢了！你拥有我！！”

The black-haired girl giggled, letting up for a minute… then ticking him even harder.  As he writhed, she laughed, "Not good enough!!  Prove it to me!!"  
黑发女孩咯咯笑着，停了一会儿……然后更加用力地挠他。他扭动着身体，她笑着说：“还不够好！！向我证明！！”

"ANYTHING!!" he wailed, "I'll do anything!!"  
"任何事！！" 他哀嚎道，"我什么都愿意做！！"

She finally relented, breathing hard and keeping him pinned.  Still snickering, she said, "Ok, you stay here… and I'll go get the frilly pink panties I want you to wear!"  As his eyes widened, she burst into fresh laughter.  
她终于让步了，喘着粗气将他按住。她一边窃笑，一边说："好吧，你留在这儿……我去拿那条我想要你穿的粉色花边内裤！" 他瞪大了眼睛，她则爆发出一阵新的笑声。

"Never!" he cried, suddenly feeling more alive than he had in months.  
"绝不！" 他喊道，突然感到比过去几个月都要充满活力。

"You said anything!!" she protested, "Do I have to… tickle you more?!"  
"你说过任何事的！！" 她抗议道，"我是不是得……再挠你痒痒？！"

"No!!" he begged, trying to break free.  
"不要！！" 他哀求着，试图挣脱。

"You promised!!" she laughed, flexing her fingers menacingly and inching them closer, "You said anything!!"  God, she thought happily, this is so much fun… HE'S so much fun. Who would have thought?  
"你答应过的！！" 她笑着，恶作剧地弯曲着手指，慢慢逼近，"你说过任何事的！！" 天啊，她开心地想，这太好玩了……他太有趣了。谁会想到呢？

It was exactly at that point that everything changed.  
就在那一刻，一切都变了。

As Shinji finally recaptured his breath, Sachiko leaned forward and pressed her lips against his.  It wasn't in any way premeditated… it was more an impulse – just a knee-jerk reaction to the happiness she felt at that very moment.  She loved her boyfriend, truly and deeply, and she would never have consciously done anything to harm him – but seeing Shinji laughing, happy, and carefree, when previously he had been so glum and straight-laced… it simply triggered a reaction inside of her.  
当真嗣终于缓过气来，纱知子向前倾身，将她的唇贴在他的唇上。这并非事先计划好的……更多的是一种冲动——只是她当时感受到的幸福所引发的本能反应。她深爱着她的男朋友，真挚而深沉，她绝不会故意做任何伤害他的事——但看到真嗣笑得如此开心，无忧无虑，而之前他一直那么忧郁和拘谨……这在她内心引发了一种反应。

"Mm…" she hummed, holding the kiss and pushing her body up against his as laughter gave way to a soft, sub-audible gasp.  Slowly, she slid her right hand up and worked it into his hair, wanting suddenly to feel it between her fingers.  Soft, she thought, closing her eyes and tilting her head to the side, so soft.  
“嗯……”她轻哼着，维持着这个吻，将身体紧贴着他，笑声渐渐转为低沉的喘息。她缓缓地用右手向上滑动，插进他的发间，突然想要感受发丝在指间的触感。柔软，她闭上眼睛，侧过头想，如此柔软。

She moaned low in her throat, leaning up slightly to free Shinji's hands, then pressing herself tightly up against him, flicking her tongue across his lips until he parted them and exploring the inside of his mouth with its tip.  Good… Lord… she thought dizzily, struggling to form a coherent thought as an unexpected rush of adrenaline and endorphins flooded her bloodstream.  
她喉咙里发出低沉的呻吟，微微抬起身子，松开了对真嗣双手的束缚，然后紧紧贴向他，用舌尖轻拂他的唇，直到他张开嘴，她便探入其中，细细探索。天哪……她晕乎乎地想着，努力拼凑出一个连贯的念头，因为一股突如其来的肾上腺素和内啡肽涌入她的血液。

Her attempt at reasoning failed completely as Shinji slid his arms around her waist, pulling her closer to him, and all of her higher brain functions seemed to shut down as he tentatively slipped his right hand up under her shirt.  
当真嗣环住她的腰，将她拉近时，她试图理智思考的努力彻底失败了，而当他试探性地将右手滑入她的衬衫下时，她所有的高级脑功能似乎都关闭了。

If you've never been in a situation like this… you cannot understand just what happens.  You can comprehend on a purely scientific level – the baser instincts take over, blood flow is redirected from the brain to other parts of the body (primarily the erogenous zones) and rational thinking becomes harder.  But unless you've experienced it yourself, you cannot truly know what it FEELS like, or how it is nearly impossible to stop once you reach a certain point.  
如果你从未经历过这样的情况……你无法真正理解发生了什么。你可以在纯粹的科学层面上理解——更原始的本能接管了，血液从大脑流向身体的其他部位（主要是性敏感区），理性思考变得困难。但除非你亲身体验过，否则你无法真正知道那感觉如何，或者一旦达到某个点，几乎不可能停下来。

Sachiko's heart rate shot through the roof as the brown-haired boy leaned forward, laying her on the coffee table and urging her to put her legs around him.  
当棕发男孩俯身向前，将她放在咖啡桌上并催促她用双腿环绕他时，幸子的脉搏飙升。

Neither of them noticed that the soda cans had spilled.  
他们俩都没有注意到汽水罐已经洒了出来。

As Shinji pulled the dark-haired girl's shirt off, throwing it carelessly to the side before crushing her lips against his once more… his cell phone rang.  
当真嗣脱下黑发女孩的衬衫，随意地扔到一边，再次将她的嘴唇紧紧压在自己的唇上时……他的手机响了。

Sachiko pushed him back abruptly, breathing hard.  "I… that's your phone," she panted, her cheeks flushed with color.  Before he could reply, she twisted out from under him and rose to her feet, covering her chest.  "You should… get that."  
幸子突然将他推开，呼吸急促。“我……那是你的手机，”她喘着气说，双颊泛起红晕。还没等他回答，她就从他身下扭出身子，站了起来，遮住胸口。“你应该……接一下。”

Shinji fumbled for the device, his face a brilliant shade of crimson.  
真嗣手忙脚乱地摸索着手机，脸红得像熟透的番茄。

Fuck… Sachiko thought, shame replacing lust in the blink of an eye, what am I doing?!  As Shinji finally dug the phone from his pocket, she grabbed her shirt, rushing into the other room.  She leaned up against the door, her body shaking with a mixture of desire, embarrassment, and just a touch of fear.  
该死……幸子心想，欲望瞬间被羞愧取代，我到底在干什么？！当真嗣终于从口袋里掏出手机时，她抓起衬衫，匆匆跑进另一个房间。她靠在门上，身体因欲望、尴尬和一丝恐惧而颤抖。

What if Domiyoji finds out? she thought frantically.  She shook her head, To hell with that! she added mentally, What NOW?  I just nearly FUCKED Shinji!  Hot, confused tears began coursing down her face as she realized it was true.  Another five minutes or so and she was sure they would have been doing it.  How am I going to face him when I go back in there – let alone at work every day?!  
要是道明寺知道了怎么办？她慌乱地想着。她摇了摇头，管他呢！她心里又补充道，现在怎么办？我刚刚差点和真治上床了！当她意识到这是真的时，滚烫而混乱的泪水开始顺着她的脸颊流下。再过五分钟，她确信他们就会真的做了。我回去怎么面对他——更别提每天在工作中了？！

She stayed in the other room for several minutes, trying to collect herself.  Finally, she donned her shirt and opened the door, determined to just talk to him about what had happened and make sure that he understood that it had not been her intention to lead him on.  
她在另一个房间里待了几分钟，试图让自己冷静下来。最后，她穿上衬衫，打开门，决心和他谈谈发生的事情，确保他明白这并非她的本意去引诱他。

The living room was empty.  
客厅空无一人。

"Great," she whispered, slumping back against the wall and sliding down to the floor, "just great."  
"太好了，"她低声自语，无力地靠回墙边，滑坐到地板上，"真是太好了。"

Closing her eyes, she rested her head back against the wall, letting herself fall asleep right there, one word echoing in her mind and following her relentlessly into her dreams,  
她闭上眼睛，将头靠在墙上，任由自己就在那里入睡，一个词在脑海中回响，无情地跟随她进入梦境，

Whore… 妓女……

**

"Shinji here yet?" “真嗣来了吗？”

Alexander looked up from the grill, shaking his head. "Nope," he said, "called in – friend of his got in an accident.  Won't be here tomorrow, either, and since Friday and Saturday are his days off…"  
亚历山大从烤架旁抬起头，摇了摇头。“没有，”他说，“他打电话来说，他朋友出了事故。明天也不会来，而且周五和周六是他休息的日子……”

Sachiko sighed as he trailed off.  "Thanks, Alex," she murmured.  
他话没说完，幸子叹了口气。“谢谢你，亚历克斯。”她低声说道。

"Sure sure," the cook replied, waving a hand, "he did say he should be back on Sunday, though."  He grinned.  "Why? He owe you money or something?"  
“当然当然，”厨师挥了挥手，“他确实说过应该周日回来。”他咧嘴一笑。“怎么了？他欠你钱还是什么？”

Sachiko forced a smile, knowing the man would pick up on it if she just said 'nothing.'  "Yeah," she said as lightly as she could, "we played rock paper scissors for fifty cents a pop.   Punk owes me ten grand."  
幸子强作笑容，知道如果她只说“没什么”，对方会察觉到。“是啊，”她尽可能轻松地说，“我们玩石头剪刀布，一次五十美分。那小子欠我一万块。”

Alexander laughed.  "Well," he said with a wink, "I won't tell him you're looking – I don't wanna scare him off."  
亚历山大笑了。“好吧，”他眨了眨眼，“我不会告诉他你在找他——我不想把他吓跑。”

"Thanks…" "谢谢…"

As she got ready for work, Sachiko sighed.  Four days, she thought, God, I'm such an idiot!  
当她准备去上班时，幸子叹了口气。四天了，她想，天哪，我真是个傻瓜！

"How did it go?" an anxious voice asked her.  
"情况怎么样？"一个焦虑的声音问她。

Great, the black-haired girl thought darkly, when it rains it pours.  "He's single," she murmured, not raising her head, "go for it."  
太好了，黑发女孩暗自思忖，祸不单行。她低声自语，没有抬头，“他单身，”她喃喃道，“去追吧。”

"Thanks Sachi!!" “谢谢你，Sachi！”

Sachiko found herself feeling ill as Mitzuki hugged her from behind.  Sure! she thought bitterly, Hey, when you call to ask if he wants to go out, can you ask him if he had wet dreams too – because I needed to change my panties when I woke up. Can you do that? I really want to know.  She almost laughed out loud, but she knew it would have sounded mad.  
当 Mitzuki 从背后抱住她时，Sachiko 感到一阵不适。当然！她苦涩地想，嘿，你打电话约他出去时，能不能顺便问问他有没有做春梦——因为我醒来时得换内裤。你能问这个吗？我真的很想知道。她差点笑出声来，但她知道那听起来会很疯狂。

"He's cute, isn't he?" Mitzuki giggled, "And so sweet! Yesterday…"  
“他很可爱，不是吗？”光月咯咯笑着，“而且还那么甜！昨天……”

As the other girl gushed about her hopefully-soon-to-be-boyfriend, Sachiko sighed.  She doubted that any of Shinji's friends got hurt – no, she was sure he was avoiding her, and she couldn't blame him. If HE had been the one to start what they had done the night before, she doubted he would EVER come back to work.  
当另一个女孩滔滔不绝地谈论她可能很快就会成为她男朋友的对象时，幸子叹了口气。她怀疑真嗣的朋友中没有人受伤——不，她确信他在躲着她，而她不能怪他。如果昨晚是他们中的他主动的，她怀疑他永远都不会回来工作了。

At least we didn't go all the way, she thought tiredly, sure fucking DREAMT about it, though.  She blushed, feeling that it was bad enough that she had kissed him in the first place, but the dreams she had afterwards had been… vivid.  
至少我们没有做到最后，她疲惫地想，尽管确实梦到了。她脸红了，觉得一开始吻他就够糟糕的了，但之后的梦……却异常生动。

She wondered idly if she had some sort of disorder.  
她漫不经心地想，自己是不是有什么毛病。

"Anyway," Mitzuki was saying, "I hope he says yes," she blushed faintly, "and I hope he isn't, you know, freaked out by…" she trailed off.  
"总之，" 光月正说着，"我希望他会答应，" 她微微脸红，"也希望他不会，你知道的，被吓到……" 她话音渐弱。

"He won't be," Sachiko said gently, looking at the other girl's ever-present bandana, "he's not that kind of guy.  That won't bother him."  
"他不会的，" 幸子温柔地说，目光落在对方一直戴着的头带上，"他不是那种人。这不会困扰他的。"

"You think?" the other girl asked hopefully.  She smiled as Sachiko nodded.  "I hope you're right," she grinned mischievously.  "I feel kinda shameless," she admitted suddenly.  
“你这么认为吗？”另一个女孩满怀希望地问道。她看到幸子点头，便笑了。“希望你是对的，”她调皮地咧嘴一笑。“我有点觉得自己不知羞耻，”她突然坦白道。

"Why?" the black-haired girl asked, confused, "For asking a boy out? That's not-"  
"为什么？" 黑发女孩困惑地问，"就因为约男生出去？这没什么——"

"No, no!" Mitzuki interrupted. "Because of his age, stupid!"  
"不，不！" 光月打断道，"因为他年纪啊，笨蛋！"

Age? Sachiko thought, How old is he, anyway?  Seventeen? Eighteen?  
年纪？幸子心想，他到底多大了？十七？十八？

Mizuki leaned back against her locker, sighing softly.  "I guess four years isn't all that much, but still, I-"  
水木靠在她的储物柜上，轻轻叹了口气。“我想四年也不算太长，但即便如此，我——”

"He's twenty-three?" Sachiko asked, knowing even as the words left her mouth that this was not the case.  He CAN'T be fifteen, she thought dazedly, he just can't!!  
“他二十三岁？”幸子问道，尽管话一出口她就知道并非如此。他不可能只有十五岁，她茫然地想，这绝对不可能！！

"You're so funny!" her friend giggled, "Come on, we're gonna miss our whole shift if we stay here chatting like this."  
“你真有趣！”她的朋友咯咯笑道，“快点，我们再这样聊下去就要错过整个班次了。”

The black-haired girl nodded, her eyes wide and staring.  Fifteen, she thought wonderingly, What the hell happened to you, Shinji?  What happened to make your eyes look so old…?  Sighing, she rose to her feet, tying her apron on.  Sunday, she thought, pushing thoughts of his blue eyes out of her mind, Sunday.  
黑发女孩点点头，眼睛睁得大大的，直勾勾地盯着。十五岁，她惊奇地想，真嗣，你到底经历了什么？是什么让你的眼神变得如此沧桑……？她叹了口气，站起身来，系上围裙。星期天，她想，把关于他蓝色眼睛的念头抛诸脑后，星期天。

**

Asuka frowned slightly, biting her lower lip as she asked, "So… shouldn't you be at work or something?"  
明日香微微皱眉，咬着下唇问道：“那么……你不是应该在工作什么的吗？”

Shinji leaned back in his chair, sighing softly.  "Yeah," he said softly, "but I just didn't feel like going in today.  Too much on my mind, I guess."  
真嗣靠在椅背上，轻轻叹了口气。“是啊，”他轻声说，“但我今天就是不想去上班。大概是心里有太多事吧。”

The redhead studied the boy's face for a long moment, trying to summon up some of her old attitude… but therapy had been hard that day, and she couldn't quite manage it.  Instead, she met his eyes levelly and whispered, "Do you want to talk about it?"  
红发女孩长久地凝视着男孩的脸庞，试图唤起一些往日的锐气……但那天的心理治疗异常艰难，她始终无法完全做到。于是，她平静地迎上他的目光，轻声问道：“你想谈谈这件事吗？”

The former Third Child smiled wanly.  Six months ago, I would have fallen out of my chair hearing you say that, he mused, averting his eyes, now I don't have the energy.  Why do I keep going?  He looked back, but Asuka's eye was focused on her right hand.  "Is it bad today?" he asked gently, choosing to push thoughts of Sachiko aside for the time being.  
前第三适格者苦涩地笑了笑。六个月前，听到你这么说，我可能会从椅子上摔下来，他思忖着，移开了视线，现在我却连那份力气都没有了。我为何还要继续？他回望过去，但明日香的目光却停留在她的右手上。“今天情况很糟吗？”他轻声问道，暂时将关于幸子的念头搁置一旁。

The German girl looked up at him, unsmiling as she replied, "It's bad every day… but yeah, it's worse today than it was last time you were here."  For a very long moment she said nothing, then she cleared her throat and whispered, "On the beach… when I touched you."  
德国女孩抬头看着他，面无表情地回答：“每天都很难熬……但今天比上次你来的时候更糟。”她沉默了许久，然后清了清嗓子，低声说道：“在海滩上……当我触碰到你的时候。”

Shinji tensed, leaning forward.  "Yeah…?"  
真嗣紧张地前倾身体。“嗯……？”

They had not talked about it before, and Shinji sometimes wondered if it had been a dream.  He had been so full of rage, lying on top of her… trying to kill her… crying like a baby when she had touched him.  When they had been found, gently embraced in the soft sand, Asuka had been on the brink of death.  The wounds that the lances had caused her were deep and cruel, and they had both been sure she was going to die.  
他们之前从未谈及此事，有时真嗣甚至怀疑那是否只是一场梦。他当时满腔怒火，压在她身上……试图杀死她……却在她触碰他时像个婴儿般哭泣。当他们被发现时，两人温柔地拥抱着躺在柔软的沙地上，明日香已濒临死亡。那些长矛造成的伤口深且残忍，他们俩都确信她即将死去。

They had not spoken as they lay there, too frightened that breaking the silence would somehow ruin the bond that had formed between them, and too frightened that every breath might be her last.  
他们躺在那里时没有说话，太害怕打破沉默会破坏他们之间形成的纽带，也太害怕每一次呼吸都可能是她的最后一次。

Asuka closed her good eye, taking a deep breath.  "Well, you know that I get out of here on Saturday, and I… want to stay with you… if that's ok," she said, obviously having trouble asking for that favor. "You're the only person left that knows what really happened," her eye opened and she smiled at him weakly, "and you're the only one who puts up with my shit."  
明日香闭上了她那只好眼睛，深吸了一口气。“嗯，你知道我周六就要离开这里了，而我……想和你住在一起……如果可以的话，”她显然在请求这个恩惠时遇到了困难。“你是唯一一个知道真相的人了，”她的眼睛睁开，虚弱地对他笑了笑，“而且你是唯一一个能忍受我那些破事的人。”

Shinji leaned back, crestfallen.  "Of course," he said as levelly as he could.  
真嗣向后靠去，显得有些沮丧。“当然，”他尽可能平静地说道。

He was the only person that knew what happened.  Oddly enough, everyone else seemed to have forgotten – whether deliberately or just because it was too painful to remember – what exactly happened when Instrumentality was executed.  He was more than happy at the promise of her living with him again, but he had been hoping she would tell him why she had touched him that way.  
他是唯一一个知道发生了什么的人。奇怪的是，其他人似乎都忘记了——无论是故意的还是因为回忆起来太过痛苦——执行人类补完计划时究竟发生了什么。他对于她再次与他同住的承诺感到非常高兴，但他一直希望她能告诉他，为什么她会以那种方式触碰他。

It was one of his best memories.  
那是他最美好的记忆之一。

"I'll let you get some rest," Shinji said quietly, getting to his feet, "I'll come back tomorrow and-"  
"我会让你休息一下，" 真嗣轻声说道，站起身来，"我明天再回来，然后-"

"Shinji," Asuka cut him off.  
"真嗣，" 明日香打断了他。

"Hmmm…?" "嗯……？"

She looked at him for a long moment, wanting him to stay for a little longer, but not knowing how to ask without seeming needy.  Finally, she smiled faintly, pushing her concerns aside. "Don't go yet, ok?  Stay and talk to me some more…?"  
她长久地凝视着他，希望他能多留一会儿，却又不知如何开口而不显得过分渴求。最终，她微微一笑，将忧虑抛诸脑后。"别急着走，好吗？留下来再和我聊聊……？"

Again, Shinji was taken with the change in her.  Instrumentality had changed them both – he was not as weak as he used to be, and she was not as prideful – but they were still essentially the same people.  
再次，真嗣被她的变化所触动。人类补完计划改变了他们俩——他不再像以前那样软弱，而她也不再那么傲慢——但他们本质上仍是同一个人。

Change takes time, he thought, returning to his seat, but she seems to be taking less time than me.  He studied the girl's face closely, She always was stronger.  He blushed, looking down at the floor, And I'll bet SHE never would have let something like THAT happen – she would have told the guy to get the hell away from her.  
改变需要时间，他想，回到座位上，但她似乎比我用的时间更少。他仔细端详着女孩的脸，她总是更坚强。他脸红了，低头看着地板，我敢打赌她绝不会让那种事发生——她会叫那家伙滚远点。

The incident with Sachiko was like a dark shadow that he kept looking away from.  He knew it was there – could feel its cold touch on his skin – but he did not dare face it, because he was afraid of what he might see in its dark confines.  Would he find that he was as weak as he had always been?  Unable to stop, even though he knew she was seeing someone?  Would he see that he didn't love Asuka?  Why had he kissed Sachiko back?  
与幸子的事件就像一个他不断回避的黑暗阴影。他知道它就在那里——能感受到它冰冷的触感——但他不敢直视，因为他害怕在黑暗深处会发现什么。他会发现自己一如既往地软弱吗？明知她在和别人交往却无法停止？他会发现他并不爱明日香吗？为什么他要回应幸子的吻？

Too many dark questions – with answers he was not quite sure he wanted to hear.  
太多黑暗的问题——答案他不太确定自己是否想听。

He had pondered telling Asuka about it, but had immediately discarded the idea.  She would definitely hate him if she knew how brazen he was, and any chance that they could ever have would disappear in a nanosecond – she had told him during Instrumentality that she only wanted him if he was hers alone.  
他曾考虑过告诉明日香，但随即打消了这个念头。她要是知道他有多么厚颜无耻，肯定会恨他，他们之间任何可能的机会都会在瞬间化为乌有——她在人类补完计划期间告诉过他，她只希望他是她一个人的。

"So are Hikari and Touji hitched yet?" Asuka asked quietly, glad that he had not run away.  He's changed too; she thought happily, now if we could both just change ENOUGH, I think… she let the thought trail off, unprepared for maybes just then.  
“那光和阿薰结婚了吗？”明日香轻声问道，庆幸他没有逃跑。他变了；她开心地想，现在如果我们都能改变得足够多，我想……她让这个念头渐渐消散，那时还没准备好面对可能性的不确定性。

"Not yet," Shinji answered, glad to have something to talk about, "but I think he'll ask soon – I mean, I hope he'll ask soon. I think it would make them both happy.  At least then they'd have each other."  
“还没有，”真嗣回答，很高兴有话题可聊，“但我觉得他很快就会求婚了——我是说，我希望他很快就会求婚。我觉得那会让他们俩都幸福。至少那样他们就能拥有彼此了。”

"Awww," Asuka said, letting a note of gentle sarcasm creep into her tone to try and lighten the mood, "how sweet."  
"哎呀，" 明日香说道，语气中带着一丝温和的讽刺，试图缓和气氛，"真甜蜜。

Shinji laughed, feeling some of the tension leave him.  "Well," he pointed out with a grin, "Hikari does say he has that 'sensitive side' to him."  
真嗣笑了，感到紧张感有所缓解。 "嗯，" 他带着笑容指出，"光说她确实说过他有那种'敏感的一面'。

Asuka answered his laugh with one of her own.  "I keep telling her that she's making a mistake dating him, but she's stubborn."  Her laughter subsided, and she plucked at her bed sheets, not really knowing what to say next.  
明日香也跟着笑了起来。 "我一直告诉她和他约会是个错误，但她很固执。" 她的笑声渐渐平息，她拨弄着床单，不知道接下来该说什么。

There was an awkward pause, then Shinji sighed. "I'm sure they'll be fine," he said firmly, "and I'm sure Touji will ask soon – he's… stronger than he looks."  
一阵尴尬的沉默后，真嗣叹了口气。“我相信他们会没事的，”他坚定地说，“而且我肯定剑介很快就会问的——他……比看起来要坚强。”

Asuka nodded slowly, deciding to change the subject before her former (and soon to be) roommate went into a swift decline thinking about how lonely his friend was.  "How's the job?"  
明日香缓缓点头，决定换个话题，以免她曾经的（也将是未来的）室友因为担心朋友的孤独而迅速陷入消沉。“工作怎么样？”

Shinji paled slightly, as if she had just asked if it was his secretary that she saw him with at the movies the other night when he said he was working late.  "It's going good," he said uneasily, "the people are really nice, but my hands get all dry and-"  
真嗣的脸色微微发白，仿佛她刚问的是那晚他声称加班时，在电影院看到和他在一起的是不是他的秘书。“工作挺好的，”他不安地说，“同事们都很友善，但我的手会变得很干燥，而且——”

"Shinji…" "真嗣…"

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"Are you… waiting for me?"  
"你…是在等我吗？"

"What do you mean?  I'm waiting for you to get better, is that-"  
"你是什么意思？我在等你好起来，是这个——"

"No, are you waiting for me…?"  
"不，你是说在等我……？"

The brown-haired boy blushed, not expecting her direct question.  "Should I…?" he asked, barely breathing.  
棕发男孩脸红了，没想到她会直接问这个问题。“我应该……？”他几乎屏住呼吸问道。

Asuka looked away, fighting to say what she wanted to say, and not exactly knowing what that was.  "Would you…?"  How long they sat there in silence, she did not know, but it felt like forever.  Finally, Shinji got to his feet, putting his hand carefully on her injured one and smiling uncertainly.  
明日香别过头去，努力想说些什么，却又不太清楚自己究竟想表达什么。“你会……？”他们就这样沉默地坐着，不知过了多久，仿佛永恒一般。终于，真嗣站起身来，小心翼翼地将手放在她受伤的那只手上，带着一丝不确定的微笑。

As he opened his mouth to answer, his cell phone rang.  
正当他张嘴准备回答时，他的手机响了。

"You should get that," the redhead murmured, blushing faintly as he reclaimed his hand, "I'll wait."  
“你应该接一下，”红发女孩轻声说道，脸颊微微泛红，他收回了自己的手，“我等你。”

Shinji nodded, reaching into his pocket for his ringing phone (advances in shielding had ensured that man never had to go without his cell phone while doing something as menial as having surgery).   
真嗣点点头，伸手从口袋里掏出响个不停的手机（屏蔽技术的进步确保了人们在做诸如手术这样的琐事时，也无需与手机分离）。

"Hello?" “喂？”

"Shinji! Hi!" “真嗣！嗨！”

"Mitzuki?" the former Third Child said, confused, "Is something wrong?"  
"Mitzuki?" 前第三适格者困惑地说，"有什么事吗？"

Asuka frowned slightly.  Why is she calling him? she thought, confused, Is there a dish-related emergency they just can't handle?  She grinned as Shinji listened on the phone, I can just see it now, 'Mister Ikari! The sink is plugged!  Only your expertise can save-'  
明日香微微皱眉。她为什么要打电话给他？她困惑地想，难道是处理不了与餐具有关的紧急情况？她一边咧嘴笑着，一边听着真嗣在电话那头说话，我仿佛已经看到了，'一尉！水槽堵住了！只有您的专业才能拯救——'

"You mean like a date…?"  
"你是说像约会那样…？"

The redhead's blood froze in her veins.  
红发少女的血液仿佛在血管中凝固了。

NO!

Shinji hesitated. "I don't…" he glanced at Asuka, "no, I'm not, but… uh huh…" he stared into the former Second Child's blue eye, hoping she would protest this.  Now, he thought desperately, tell me now, Asuka… should I stop?  
真嗣犹豫了一下。“我不……”他瞥了明日香一眼，“不，我没有，但是……呃嗯……”他凝视着前二号机驾驶员的蓝眼睛，希望她能反对这一点。现在，他绝望地想，现在告诉我，明日香……我应该停下来吗？

Asuka looked away, saying nothing.  
明日香移开视线，一言不发。

The brown-haired boy's heart sank.  "Yeah," he heard himself murmur, "I'll talk to you about it Monday, then… bye."  He hung up the phone, putting it back in his pocket, "Asuka, I-"  
棕发少年的心沉了下去。“嗯，”他听到自己低声说，“那我们周一再谈吧……再见。”他挂断电话，放回口袋，“明日香，我——”

"I'm gonna get some sleep," the redhead cut him off, yawning expansively, "see ya."  
“我要去睡一会儿，”红发女孩打断了他，大大地打了个哈欠，“再见。”

"But-" “但是——”

"Goodbye, Shinji." “再见，真嗣。”

As Asuka closed her eye, Shinji bowed his head.  "Bye," he said, his voice thick.  I would, he thought, heading for the door, if you want me to, Asuka, I'll wait… do you want me to? He paused, hoping she would call him back, but the only sound was her deep, even breathing.  
当明日香闭上眼睛时，真嗣低下了头。“再见，”他声音沙哑地说道。我想，他一边走向门口一边想，如果你希望我这么做，明日香，我会等的……你希望我等吗？他停下脚步，希望她会叫他回去，但唯一的声音是她深沉而均匀的呼吸。

Silently, he opened the door and walked out.  
他默默地打开门，走了出去。

Had he waited a moment longer he would have heard her quiet, frustrated tears.  
如果他再多等一会儿，就能听到她那压抑而沮丧的啜泣声。

**

"He said yes!" “他说好！”

Sachiko paused for a moment, then continued wiping the table she was working on.  "That's great, Mitzu," she said softly, "really great."  
幸子顿了顿，继续擦拭着她正在清理的桌子。“那太好了，光子，”她轻声说道，“真的很好。”

"He was so shy!" Miztuki giggled.  
“他真是害羞极了！”Miztuki 咯咯笑道。

Not the other night, the black-haired girl thought wryly, unless shy guys are in the habit of-  
不是那晚，黑发女孩苦涩地想，除非害羞的家伙习惯于——

Her thought broke off as a strong pair of arms slipped around her waist.  "Hey babe…"  
她的思绪被打断了，一双有力的手臂环住了她的腰。“嘿，宝贝……”

She shivered slightly as one of the hands moved up and discretely covered her right breast.  "Domiyoji," she gasped, feeling her body react instantly to his touch, "I told you – not in the restaurant!"  
她微微颤抖，其中一只手向上移动，悄悄地覆盖住她的右胸。“道明寺，”她喘息着，身体立刻对他的触碰产生了反应，“我告诉过你——不要在餐厅里！”

"It's after hours," her boyfriend whispered, "and Mitzuki's not gonna tell, are you?"  
“已经打烊了，”她的男友低声说，“而且美月不会说的，对吧？”

"Nope, my lips are sealed."  
“不会的，我守口如瓶。”

Sachiko looked around, seeing that none of the other workers were in the area.  "Not now, ok…?" she breathed, moving his hand gently down to her stomach.  
幸子环顾四周，发现其他员工都不在附近。“现在不行，好吗…？”她轻声说道，温柔地将他的手移到她的腹部。

"Aww," Domiyoji muttered, disappointed, "it's just a little feel – it's not like we're doing it on one of the tables or something."  
“哎呀，”道明寺嘟囔着，显得有些失望，“只是稍微摸一下而已——又不是要在桌子上做那种事。”

"You'd like to, though, wouldn't you?" Mitzuki chimed in, giggling, "Sex fiend."  
“不过你倒是想吧，不是吗？”美月插话道，咯咯笑着，“色情狂。”

As his girlfriend blushed, trying to finish her work, the young man grinned.  "Nothing wrong with sex, Mitzu… not when you're in love."  
当他的女朋友脸红着试图完成工作时，年轻人咧嘴笑了。“性没什么不对的，Mitzu……当你恋爱时就不是。”

Sachiko froze.  God hates me, she thought darkly, that's what it is – God just hates my guts.  
Sachiko 僵住了。上帝讨厌我，她阴郁地想，就是这样——上帝就是讨厌我。

"Don't you worry about chafing?" Mitzuki asked lightly, "I mean, I assume you know about lubricant, but really, as much as you two-"  
“你不怕摩擦吗？”Mitzuki 轻描淡写地问，“我是说，我知道你知道润滑剂，但真的，你们俩这么频繁……”

"You're just jealous," Domiyoji cut in, "how long has it been since you got any, Mitzu?  Five months? Six?"  
"你只是嫉妒罢了，" 道明寺插话道，"你有多久没碰过男人了，光？五个月？还是六个月？"

Mitzuki grinned.  "Well, that might change soon," she said happily, "I asked that new guy out."  
光笑着说："嗯，这可能很快就会改变，"她开心地说，"我约了那个新来的家伙出去。"

"The kid?" "那个小子？"

Sachiko bristled at her boyfriend's description of Shinji.  Why is it, she thought tiredly, that I'M the only person that didn't know he was that young?  "He's a good guy," she said, tossing the rag to the side, "you'd like him."  
听到男友对真嗣的描述，幸子感到一阵不悦。为什么，她疲惫地想，只有我不知道他那么年轻？“他是个好人，”她说着，把抹布扔到一边，“你会喜欢他的。”

"You guys should go with us!" Mitzuki said suddenly, "We're gonna go see a movie, probably next weekend."  
“你们应该跟我们一起去！”光希突然说道，“我们打算去看电影，可能是下周末。”

"You're on," Domiyoji replied enthusiastically before Sachiko could say a word, "he's always busy or just leaving whenever I drop by, and I wanna see what he's like."  He grinned, letting his hand once again climb up his girlfriend's shirt.  "And if my honey says I'll like him, I definitely want to meet him."  
“就这么定了，”道明寺热情地回应，没等幸子开口，“每次我去找他，他总是忙或者刚走，我想看看他是什么样的人。”他咧嘴一笑，手再次攀上女友的衬衫。“既然我的甜心说我会喜欢他，那我一定要见见他。”

Sachiko sighed softly, letting him touch her.  Go ahead, she thought a touch bitterly, let's never forget you get everything you want.  She blushed, knowing this was an unfair thought.  Their relationship was actually very well balanced, with compromises on both sides, so to say he always got his way was entirely untrue – and she knew it.  But it felt good… it felt good to be able to feel angry with him.  
Sachiko 轻叹一声，任由他触碰。 来吧，她有些苦涩地想，让我们永远不要忘记你总能得到你想要的。 她脸红了，知道这个想法不公平。 他们的关系实际上非常平衡，双方都有妥协，所以说他总是如愿以偿完全不真实——她心里明白。 但感觉很好……能够对他生气，感觉很好。

It certainly beat feeling angry with herself.  
这总比对自己生气要好。

"Do you want to go home?" the dark-haired boy whispered, kissing the back of her neck gently, "I haven't gotten to see you for four days. I've missed you."  
“你想回家吗？”黑发男孩轻声耳语，温柔地吻了吻她的后颈，“我已经四天没见到你了。我想你了。”

Damnit, Sachiko thought, biting her lower, why am I such a loser?!  I came THIS close to cheating on him, and now…  
该死，幸子咬着下唇想，我怎么这么失败？！我差点就背叛了他，现在……

"Yeah, let me finish cleaning up my station."  
“好的，让我先把我的工作台清理干净。”

Domiyoji kissed her earlobe lightly, lowering his hands to her stomach.  "I love you," he murmured, "do you want me to help?  Make it go faster?"  He dropped his voice lower, so that it was for her ears only, "I want you… right… now."  
道明寺轻轻吻了她的耳垂，双手缓缓下滑至她的腹部。“我爱你，”他低语道，“需要我帮忙吗？让事情快点结束？”他压低了声音，只让她一人听见，“我现在就想要你……”

"I can… do it," she breathed, more affected by his words than his touch, "and you can have that anytime you want it."  
"我可以…做到，" 她轻声说道，他的话语比他的触碰更让她动容，"而且你随时想要都可以。"

"Have what?" Mitzuki inquired curiously.  
"要什么？" 光月好奇地问道。"

"It's a secret," the boy grinned, stepping back from Sachiko, "I'm gonna go talk to Alex for a few while you finish up, ok?"  
"这是个秘密，" 男孩笑着后退离开幸子，"我去和亚历克斯聊一会儿，你先忙完，好吗？"

Sachiko nodded, staring off into space as he walked off.  I'm so shameless, she thought, I should tell him what happened, but I'm just going to shut up and go back to my place, or his place, and… and…  
幸子点点头，目光茫然地随着他离去。我真是无耻，她心想，我应该告诉他发生了什么，但我只是打算闭嘴回到我的住处，或者他的住处，然后……然后……

"You ok, Sachiko?" Mitzuki asked, grinning slightly, "Or are you just thinking about getting off… so you can get off?"  
“你还好吗，幸子？”光希笑着问，“还是你在想着怎么离开……以便能解脱？”

Sachiko laughed.  "You're a pervert!" she admonished, "We're not going to run off and have sex!  We're just gonna go home and talk, maybe watch a…" she trailed off as her coworker leaned forward, pulling on an imaginary pair of boots.  "What are you doing?"  
幸子笑了。“你真是个变态！”她责备道，“我们不会跑去发生关系！我们只是回家聊聊，也许看看……”她话音未落，同事便向前倾身，拉扯着一双想象中的靴子。“你在干什么？”

"Getting my hip-waders on," Mitzuki replied dryly, "because suddenly – I'm knee-deep in bullshit!"  
"穿上我的涉水裤，" 光月干巴巴地回答，"因为突然间——我陷入了满是废话的泥潭！"

They stared at each other in silence for a moment, then Sachiko burst out laughing.  "Oh shut up!" she giggled, "You're just mad you're not getting any tonight – now get out of here so I can clean up!"  
她们沉默地对视了一会儿，然后幸子突然爆发出笑声。"哦，闭嘴吧！"她咯咯笑着，"你只是因为今晚没得逞而生气——现在快出去，让我打扫一下！"

"Not tonight," Mitzuki grinned, "but soon."  
"今晚不行，" 光月咧嘴一笑，"但很快。"

The dark-haired girl sobered slightly.  "You don't know that," she said softly, "I don't think he's done very much, Mitzu.  He might not be ready to-"  
黑发女孩稍微清醒了些。  “你不知道，”她轻声说，“我觉得他没做什么，Mitzu。他可能还没准备好——”

"Ooo!" the other girl cut her off, winking, "So I get to be the teacher?"  She smiled as her friend started to protest again, "Calm down, Sachiko," she said, turning to walk off, "I'm not going to just tear his clothes off on our first date." She averted her eyes. "But he's really nice, you know?  And if he wants to…" she trailed off, shrugging awkwardly.  "Know what I mean?"  
“哦哦！”另一个女孩打断她，眨眼道，“那我岂不是成了老师？”她笑着看朋友又要抗议，“冷静点，Sachiko，”她说着转身走开，“我可不会在第一次约会就撕掉他的衣服。”她移开视线。“但他真的很不错，你知道吗？如果他愿意……”她尴尬地耸耸肩，话没说完。“懂我意思吧？”

"Yeah…" “嗯……”

Sachiko watched Mitzuki wander off, wondering why she should even care.  Not like he's MY boyfriend, she thought, I just… I dunno – the way he kissed me.  She shook her head, moving to the next table to be wiped down, I think he's pretty mixed up right now, and after what we did… I don't think her offering herself to him – or even just making it known that she's willing – will be a good thing.  
幸子看着光希走开，不明白自己为何要在意。她心想，又不是我的男朋友，我只是……不知道——他吻我的方式。她摇摇头，走到下一张桌子前擦拭，我觉得他现在很混乱，而我们做了那件事之后……我不认为她主动献身给他——或者只是表明她愿意——会是件好事。

She sighed, finishing her cleaning duties and removing her apron… and trying to remind herself that, really, it was not her business.  
她叹了口气，完成了清洁工作，脱下围裙……并试图提醒自己，真的，这不关她的事。

The walk to the taxi was painfully silent.  Asuka had not spoken much in the past three days, and Shinji had not made much of an effort to start conversations.  He had visited her, as promised, but they had not talked about anything deeper than the weather or their friends.  The only real interesting topic was Kensuke, who (Shinji informed Asuka) was seeing some girl, and apparently doing well, though he had been really busy when Shinji had tried to call him, and he had not wanted to be a bother, so he had not gotten much detail.  
走向出租车的路上异常沉默。明日香在过去的三天里没怎么说话，而真嗣也没有努力去开启话题。他如约来看望她，但他们只聊了些天气或朋友之类的浅层话题。唯一真正有趣的话题是健介，据真嗣告诉明日香，他正在和某个女孩交往，而且似乎进展顺利，尽管真嗣试图打电话给他时他非常忙，真嗣不想打扰他，所以没得到太多细节。

"Give me your hand," Shinji said quietly, opening the taxi door and stepping in front of her, "I'll help you."  
“把手给我，”真嗣轻声说道，打开出租车门并站在她面前，“我来帮你。”

Asuka opened her mouth to snap that she didn't need his help, but she closed it again and reached out with her good hand, frowning slightly as he carefully helped her up out of the wheelchair.  "Thanks," she mumbled, grimacing slightly in pain as she arranged herself in the backseat.  
明日香张嘴想要反驳说她不需要他的帮助，但随即又闭上了嘴，用她那只没受伤的手伸向他，微微皱眉，在他小心翼翼地帮她从轮椅上站起来时。“谢谢，”她咕哝着，坐进后座时因疼痛而微微皱眉。

The brown-haired boy nodded, handing the wheelchair over to the nurse that had walked them out and sliding into the vehicle.  After giving his address to the driver, he leaned back, looking out the window and thinking; Well at least she didn't decide to live on her own.  
棕色头发的男孩点点头，将轮椅交给陪同他们出来的护士，然后滑进车内。向司机报出地址后，他靠回座椅，望向窗外沉思；至少她没决定独自生活。

As if reading his thoughts, the redhead muttered, "This is just temporary, you know – just until the doctor says I can live alone."  
仿佛读懂了他的心思，红发女孩低声咕哝道：“这只是暂时的，你知道的——直到医生说我可以独自生活。”

Shinji continued looking out the window.  "Yeah," he whispered, "I know."  
真嗣继续望向窗外。“嗯，”他轻声回应，“我知道。”

"And I don't need you following me from room to room, either," Asuka added, "I'm not an invalid."  
“我也不需要你跟着我房间到房间的，”明日香补充道，“我不是个病人。”

"Ok."

The former Second Child scowled.  "Are you even listening to me?!?"  
前二号机驾驶员皱起了眉头。“你到底有没有在听我说话？！”

The brown-haired boy turned to face her.  "I am," he assured her quietly.  Seeing her brow drawing further down, he quickly changed the subject.  "I put some of your old things in your room for you," he informed her, smiling as he added, "and Touji said, 'Tell her not to expect me to treat her any different – she's not the only one who's messed up!'"  
棕发男孩转向她，轻声安慰道：“我在听。”见她眉头越发紧锁，他迅速转换了话题。“我把你的旧东西放在你房间里了，”他笑着补充道，“东治说，‘告诉她别指望我有什么不同对待——她不是唯一一个搞砸了的！’”

"He's a stooge," Asuka snorted, "I hope he doesn't expect me to get things from upstairs for him. Fruitcake."  
“他真是个傻瓜，”明日香嗤之以鼻，“希望他别指望我给他从楼上拿东西。疯子。”

Shinji sighed.  "He's got a prosthetic."  
真嗣叹了口气。  "他装了假肢。"

"He'll still try and take advantage – he's a goober!"  
"他还是会试图占便宜——他是个笨蛋！"

Heaving another sigh, the former Third Child looked back out the window, wondering if having two injured, short-tempered ex-pilots in the same house was such a good idea.  
再次叹息，这位前第三适格者回头望向窗外，思索着同一个屋檐下有两个受伤、脾气暴躁的前驾驶员是否是个好主意。

Since the incident with the thirteenth angel and Unit 03, Touji Suzuhara had become a slightly more bitter person.  To his credit, it was only slightly, and only those that knew him well would have been able to spot the difference, as he had always been somewhat caustic and hard to approach.  His girlfriend, Hikari Horaki, had declared her love for him while he was in the hospital, and had stood by him tenaciously, refusing to let him get away from her after it had taken so much to bring them together.  Shinji found their relationship both endearing and incomprehensible.  Half of the time, they acted like love-struck fools, unable to keep their hands off one another (though to his knowledge, they had not slept together as of yet) and the other half, Hikari acted like a love-struck fool, and Touji acted vaguely annoyed.  
自从第十三使徒和零三号机事件后，铃原冬治变得稍微有些苦涩。值得称赞的是，这种变化微乎其微，只有那些了解他的人才能察觉到，因为他一直有些尖刻，难以接近。他的女友，洞木光，在他住院期间向他表白，并坚韧地陪伴在他身边，不让他从她身边溜走，毕竟他们走到一起经历了太多。真嗣觉得他们的关系既令人喜爱又难以理解。一半的时间里，他们表现得像热恋中的傻瓜，无法控制彼此的亲密（尽管据他所知，他们还没有发生关系），而另一半时间里，光表现得像个热恋中的傻瓜，冬治则显得有些不耐烦。

What was most curious to Shinji about the second behavioral pattern was that when Touji was in his 'darker' mood, Hikari seemed to want to hold his hand, kiss him, and whisper to him even more – even smiling when Touji tried to push her away.  
真嗣对第二种行为模式最感到好奇的是，当冬治处于他所谓的‘阴郁’情绪时，光似乎更想握住他的手，亲吻他，甚至在他试图推开她时低声细语，还会微笑。

I'll never understand that, he thought, shaking his head as the taxi turned onto his street, it's like she's DARING him to try and get rid of her.  
我永远也不会明白这一点，他想，当出租车拐进他所在的街道时，他摇了摇头，她就像是在挑衅他，看他敢不敢试图摆脱她。

"What time do you work tomorrow?" Asuka asked softly.  
“你明天几点上班？”明日香轻声问道。

"I don't leave home until one-thirty," Shinji replied, meeting her eyes in the reflection off the glass, "did you want to do something?"  
“我一点半才出门，”真嗣回答，透过玻璃的反射与她的目光相遇，“你想做点什么吗？”

"I wouldn't want to upset your girlfriend," the redhead replied sarcastically.  
"我可不想惹你女朋友生气，"红发女孩讽刺地回答。

"She's not my girlfriend," the brown-haired boy said tiredly, rubbing the bridge of his nose, "when she called me, that was the first time I even knew that she liked me."  
"她不是我女朋友，"棕发男孩疲惫地说，揉着鼻梁，"她打电话给我时，我才知道她喜欢我。"

"Sure, Shinji," Asuka whispered, "sure."  She sighed as the taxi came to a stop, "I was just… oh never mind."  
"当然，真嗣，"明日香低声说，"当然。" 她叹了口气，出租车停了下来，"我只是……哦，算了。"

"No, tell me, please?"  
"不，请告诉我，好吗？"

"I… haven't been to Misato's grave yet," the redhead whispered.  
"我…还没去过美里小姐的墓地，"红发女子低声说道。"

"You gonna talk all day?" the driver asked, slightly amused, "It's ok by me, just let me know so I can turn the meter back on."  
"你们要聊一整天吗？"司机略带笑意地问，"我无所谓，只要告诉我一声，我好重新打开计价器。"

Both Children gave a start, and Shinji shook his head. "N-no sir, thank you."  He opened his door as the man laughed, reaching in his pocket for some bills and handing them over.  "Come on," he said softly, offering Asuka his hand once more.  
两个孩子都吓了一跳，真嗣摇了摇头。“不，先生，谢谢您。”他打开车门，那人笑着，从口袋里掏出一些钞票递给他。“来吧，”他轻声说道，再次向明日香伸出手。

For a long moment, Asuka stayed motionless.  Then she reached out with her right hand, watching Shinji's face closely as her partially metal fingers grasped his.  "What is it like?" she whispered, "am I cold, Shinji?"  
有好一会儿，明日香一动不动。然后她伸出右手，紧紧盯着真嗣的脸，她那半金属的手指握住了他的手。“感觉怎么样？”她低声问道，“我冷吗，真嗣？”

Shinji boy looked down at the appendage, blushing faintly.  The damage to her arm had been extensive, and simply binding the wound had been ineffective, so the doctors had chosen to augment the limb with cybernetics.  Starting at her elbow and running down the back of each finger was a series of segmented carbon-alloy strips, housing a complicated array of the smallest, most sophisticated nanofiber wires that technology could offer, backed up by a series of miniature servomotors implanted under the skin in the elbow, wrist, and shoulder.  Though the assemblies were built in flesh-tones, they were still visible – especially when taking into account the fact that they did not tan or take in makeup.  Eighty percent of her arm was still flesh, but the rest was pure machine.  
真嗣男孩低头看着那只机械臂，脸上微微泛红。她的手臂受损严重，仅靠包扎伤口已无济于事，因此医生们决定用赛博技术来增强这条肢体。从她的肘部开始，沿着每根手指的背面，是一系列分段的碳合金条，内部藏有技术所能提供的最微小、最精密的纳米纤维线，背后还有一系列植入肘部、手腕和肩部皮肤下的微型伺服电机。虽然这些组件采用了肉色设计，但仍然清晰可见——尤其是考虑到它们不会晒黑或吸收化妆品的事实。她手臂的百分之八十仍是血肉之躯，但其余部分则是纯粹的机械。

And there was no way to hide it.  
而且无法隐藏这一点。

"No," Shinji said softly, smiling as he deliberately grasped her hand, "you're not."  
“不，”真嗣轻声说道，微笑着故意握住她的手，“你不是。”

"Yeah you are," a voice behind Shinji spoke up, "maybe not your skin, but you are definitely cold, Devilgirl – and I love the bandage… nice and hospitally."  
"是啊，你确实冷，"一个声音在真嗣身后响起，"也许不是你的皮肤，但你绝对冷，恶魔女孩——我喜欢那绷带……挺有医院范儿的。"

Shinji boy flinched as Asuka unconsciously tightened her grip, levering herself out of the taxi with a slight grunt and resisting the urge to touch the bandage covering her damaged eye.  "Cold like your bed, Stooge?" she shot back, "I talked to Hikari – she said you keep trying to get in her pants."  She made a pouting face, "Poor baby," she said consolingly, "guess your hand will have to do for a while longer."  
真嗣男孩被明日香无意识地抓紧而微微一颤，她轻哼一声，借助他的力量从出租车里出来，强忍着不去触摸覆盖着受伤眼睛的绷带。"冷得像你的床一样吗，跟班？"她回击道，"我和光聊过——她说你一直想泡她。"她做出一副撅嘴的表情，"可怜的宝贝，"她安慰地说，"看来你的手还得再撑一段时间了。"

Touji shrugged, leaning a bit more on his crutch.  "Yeah?" he replied lightly, "Least I can pretend it's a human I'm with.  What about you, Souryu?  When you're lying in bed, fantasizing about me, are you going to pretend I'm a robot so it feels right?"  
冬二耸了耸肩，更倚重于他的拐杖。"是吗？"他轻松地回应，"至少我可以假装和我在一起的是个人。你呢，惣流？当你躺在床上，幻想着我的时候，你会不会假装我是个机器人，这样感觉才对？"

Asuka smiled sweetly.  "Why would I have to pretend?"  She tilted her head to the side, looking thoughtfully at his left leg, "Though I might pretend you can dance…"  
明日香甜甜地笑了。“我为什么要假装呢？”她歪着头，若有所思地看着他的左腿，“不过我可能会假装你会跳舞……”

The former Fourth Child rolled his eyes as he turned away.  "Welcome home," he muttered, heading back into the house.  
前第四适格者翻了个白眼，转身离开。“欢迎回家，”他咕哝着，走回屋内。

The redhead watched him go, grinning broadly at her triumph.  Abruptly, she realized that she was still holding Shinji's hand.  Releasing it, she started up the stairs to the sizable building, her smile becoming softer as Shinji followed her, still blushing.  Opening the door, she whispered,  
红发女孩看着他离去，得意地咧嘴笑。突然，她意识到自己还握着真嗣的手。松开手，她开始走上那座宏伟建筑的楼梯，笑容变得柔和，因为真嗣跟在她后面，脸依旧红着。打开门，她低声说，“

"I'm home…" “我回来了…”

### Side 2 Shattered Illusions/The Power of a Word
Touji looked up as Shinji entered the large kitchen.  "Damn," he mused, "you look like you had a good time last night."
当真嗣走进宽敞的厨房时，阿斯兰抬头看了看。“该死，”他暗自思忖，“你看起来昨晚玩得很开心。”

"Had… weird dreams," Shinji muttered, walking through the kitchen to the living room, "Where's Asuka?" he inquired, his right hand resting on his pants pocket.
"做了些…奇怪的梦，" 真嗣嘟囔着，穿过厨房走向客厅，"明日香呢？" 他问道，右手搭在裤袋上。

"Eh," Touji replied, pushing his empty plate away, "went to physical therapy – you know the drill."  He shrugged, "Gotta tune up the robo-arm every three thousand fist clenches, or something."
"呃，" 冬二回答，把空盘子推开，"去做物理治疗了——你知道的，常规操作。" 他耸耸肩，"每握拳三千次就得调试一下机械臂，诸如此类。"

Shinji sat in one of the chairs in the living room as Touji joined him, reclining on the couch with a sizable belch.
真嗣坐在客厅的一张椅子上，冬二也加入了他，瘫坐在沙发上，打了个响亮的嗝。

"Good, was it?" Shinji asked, shaking his head in distaste.
"好吃吗？" 真嗣皱着眉头，不悦地摇了摇头。

"Leftovers from last night," Touji confirmed, patting his stomach and smiling lazily.  "Sorry… there's none left, you'll have to have cereal or something."
"昨晚的剩菜，" トウジ确认道，懒洋洋地拍了拍肚子，笑着说。"抱歉……已经没了，你只能吃麦片什么的了。"

"I'll grab something at work," the former Third Child sighed, resting his elbows on his knees and cradling his face in his palms.  "Hope it was good at least."
"我工作时再找点吃的吧，" 前第三适格者叹了口气，双肘撑在膝盖上，手掌托着脸颊。"希望至少味道还不错。"

"It ruled," Touji nodded, belching again, "even better with lots of salt and soy sauce."
"确实很棒，" 冬二点头，又打了个嗝，"尤其是加了大量盐和酱油。"

"Salt and soy?" Shinji groaned, his culinary senses shuddering, "That's like saying salt and salt!"
"盐和酱油？" 真嗣呻吟道，他的烹饪感官在颤抖，"那简直就像是在说盐和盐！"

"Yyyyyup!" the other boy smiled expansively.  "So," he said easily, "tell me about the dream."
"嗯嗯嗯！" 另一个男孩笑得十分开怀。"那么，" 他轻松地说，"告诉我那个梦吧。"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"The dream," Touji pressed.  "Don't play stupid! You said you had a weird dream, and I'm all for weird stuff – so spill it!"
“那个梦，” 真嗣追问，“别装傻！你说你做了个奇怪的梦，我可是对奇怪的东西很感兴趣的——快说出来！”

Behind his hands, Shinji frowned.
他双手背后，真嗣皱起了眉头。

The dream.  He could remember half of it in vivid detail, while the rest was cloudy and vague.  He could recall an apartment, and a conversation, and then… soft hair between his fingers, softer lips against his… pleas for more… giving more.  He imagined that he could still remember how it felt.
那个梦。他能清晰地记得其中一半的细节，而另一半则模糊不清。他记得一个公寓，一段对话，然后……指间柔软的发丝，唇上更柔软的触感……恳求更多……给予更多。他想象自己仍能记得那种感觉。

"I dreamed about Rei," he whispered.
"我梦见了丽，"他低声说道。

"Yeah?" Touji replied.  "Right on! She's hot dude."  He grinned.  "Cough up the details!"
"是吗？" 冬二回应道。 "太棒了！她可是个美女啊。" 他咧嘴一笑。 "快说说细节！"

Shinji turned slightly green.  "Why did I bring this up?" he muttered.
真嗣的脸色微微发绿。 "我为什么要提起这个？" 他喃喃自语。

"Because you really wanna tell me," Touji offered.  "Maybe not up here," he tapped his head, winking conspiratorially, "but deep down – you're aching to tell another guy about how you dream-did Ayanami.  It was that kind of dream, right?"
"因为你真的很想告诉我，" 东治提议道。"也许不是在这里，" 他敲了敲自己的头，眨眼间流露出一种默契，"但在内心深处——你渴望向另一个家伙倾诉你梦见了绫波。那是那种梦，对吧？"

Shinji suddenly felt quite ill.
真嗣突然感到非常不适。

"Hey," Touji said quietly, "Go ahead and tell me, man, I won't tell anyone else… k?"
"嘿，" 东治轻声说，"尽管告诉我吧，兄弟，我不会告诉其他人的……好吗？"

Taking a deep breath, Shinji began, his eyes growing distant as he wove the tale.
深吸一口气，真嗣开始讲述，他的眼神逐渐变得遥远，仿佛在编织一个故事。

"Well, I went over to her apartment – which is hard, since it was destroyed and all – but she invited me in, and we sat down to talk.  We talked a little about my father… and she told me how he had raised her – something she never told me when she was alive.  I told her about living with Misato and Asuka, and she leaned forward and put her hand on my knee… and then…"
“嗯，我去了她的公寓——这很难，因为那里已经被毁了——但她邀请我进去，我们坐下来聊天。我们谈了一点关于我父亲的事……她告诉我他是如何抚养她的——这是她生前从未告诉过我的。我向她讲述了和美里、明日香一起生活的经历，她倾身向前，把手放在我的膝盖上……然后……”

"And then?" Touji prompted, leaning forward in his chair in anticipation and only barely resisting the urge to add, 'You jumped her?'
“然后呢？” 冬二催促道，椅子上的他身体前倾，满怀期待，几乎忍不住要问：‘你扑向她了？’

Shinji swallowed, then continued.
真嗣咽了咽口水，然后继续说道。

"At first, nothing happened.  She just kept her hand there, and we kept talking.  Then, she stopped – right in the middle of a sentence – and said, 'Do you want to kiss me?'  Well… it was a dream, I guess, right?  I nodded… and kissed her.  It kinda got strange then, cuz-"
起初，什么都没发生。她就那样把手放在那里，我们继续聊天。然后，她突然停了下来——就在一句话的中间——说：‘你想吻我吗？’嗯……我想，那是个梦，对吧？我点了点头……吻了她。之后就变得有点奇怪了，因为——

"Ayanami just up and kissing you isn't strange?" Touji cut in, raising a hand quickly as the other boy glared at him.  "Sorry, keep going."
绫波突然吻你，这不奇怪吗？" 东治插话道，迅速举起一只手，而另一个男孩瞪了他一眼。"抱歉，继续说。

"Anyway," Shinji went on, "we were kissing… then we were naked on her bed.  I really don't remember taking her clothes off, or mine, but her hair… felt like… silk."  He sighed.  "And… she laid back… ran her hands over my chest… and asked me to claim her.  That's exactly what she said, 'I'm ready, Shinji… take me, please.  Claim me as your own.'"
"总之，" 真嗣继续说道，"我们在接吻…然后就赤裸地躺在她的床上。我真的不记得是怎么脱掉她的衣服，或者我的，但她的头发…感觉就像…丝绸。" 他叹了口气。"然后…她躺下…用手抚摸我的胸膛…并让我占有她。她就是这么说的，'我准备好了，真嗣…请带我走。把我当作你的。'"

"So," Touji murmured, "you did."
"所以，" 冬二低声说，"你做了。"

"Yeah," Shinji swallowed, "I did."
"嗯，" 真嗣咽了口唾沫，"我做了。"

"So?"

Shinji blinked.  "What do you mean, 'So?' – this is Ayanami we're talking about!!"
真嗣眨了眨眼。  “‘所以’是什么意思？——我们说的是绫波啊！！”

"So she's dream proof?" Touji asked skeptically.  He grinned suddenly.  "Hell, I used to dream that Misato was our homeroom teacher."
“所以她是无梦的？” 冬二怀疑地问。突然他咧嘴一笑。“见鬼，我以前还梦到过美里是我们班主任呢。”

Shinji brightened.  "Really?" he asked, leaning forward in his chair.  "I did too, a couple times."
真嗣眼睛一亮。 “真的吗？” 他问，身体前倾坐在椅子上。“我也梦到过几次。”

"Yeah?" Touji asked, his grin becoming wolfish.  "In yours did she have you stay after class for a special… detention?"
"是吗？" 冬二问道，他的笑容变得狡黠。"在你的梦里，她是不是让你课后留下来接受一次特别的……留堂？"

"N-no!" Shinji cried, shivering slightly at the thought of his guardian and his best friend in… detention.
"不——不是！" 真嗣喊道，一想到他的监护人和他最好的朋友在……留堂，他就微微颤抖。

"Look," Touji said with some irritation, pushing past his favorite dream with some reluctance, "you read Freud, right?"
"听着，" 冬二有些不耐烦地说，有些不情愿地从他最喜欢的梦中抽身，"你读过弗洛伊德，对吧？"

"Yeah, some," Shinji nodded, "last semester, with you."
"嗯，上过一些，" 真嗣点头，"上学期，和你一起。"

"Uh huh," the other boy said with a grin, "and remember all that stuff about girls wanting to have dicks and guys all wanting to have sex with their moms?"  He waited for Shinji to nod before leaning forward and whispering, "Well you know what?  Fuck Freud.  He didn't know shit." 
"嗯哼，" 另一个男孩咧嘴笑道，"还记得那些关于女生都想有鸡巴，男生都想和妈妈上床的鬼话吗？" 他等真嗣点头后，探身低语道，"你知道吗？去他妈的弗洛伊德。他啥也不懂。"

"Well," Shinji said defensively, "Rei was kinda my mom… sorta."
"好吧，" 真嗣辩解道，"丽也算是我妈妈……有点儿。"

"Shinji, Shinji, Shinji," Touji lamented, "weren't you paying attention at all?  Since you seem hell-bent on agreeing with a musty, old, dead German guy, let's look at this a little closer, shall we?  Didn't he say, flat out, that if you dream about having sex with someone, it doesn't necessarily mean that you want to have sex with them?"
"真嗣，真嗣，真嗣，" 冬二叹息道，"你到底有没有在听？既然你这么固执地要同意一个早已作古的德国老头的观点，那我们不妨再仔细看看，好吗？他不是明确说过，梦见和某人发生关系，并不一定意味着你想和他们发生关系吗？"

"Well, yeah, but-" "嗯，是的，但是-"

"And," Touji cut him off, "since Ayanami was sorta your mom, as you put it, wouldn't it be natural for you to dream about her?  Maybe?  Once in a while?"
"而且，" 冬二打断了他，"既然你把绫波当作你妈妈，就像你说的那样，梦见她难道不是很自然的事吗？偶尔一次？"

Shinji contemplated this for a moment, staring at the floor with a small frown.  When he replied, his voice was so low that Touji had to ask him to repeat himself.  "I said I miss her," Shinji sighed, leaning back in his chair and looking up to the ceiling.  "I think that there was some kind of mistake… and she should be here instead of-"
真嗣沉思了一会儿，皱着眉头盯着地板。当他回答时，声音低得让冬二不得不请他重复。“我说我想念她，”真嗣叹了口气，靠在椅背上，抬头望向天花板。“我觉得这里有什么误会……她应该在这里，而不是——”

"Oh here we go again!" Touji cut in, exasperated, "Look man – she was 'sorta' your mom, you saw her every day, and she was the first girl you saw naked."  His voice softened, "And you cared for her.  So of course you're going to dream about her from time to time – I think you'd be a freak if you didn't, actually."
“哦，又来了！”冬二不耐烦地打断道，“听着，伙计——她算是你妈妈，你每天都见到她，而且她是你第一个看到的裸体女孩。”他的声音柔和下来，“而且你关心她。所以你当然会时不时梦到她——我觉得如果你不梦到她，那才真是怪胎。”

"When did you get all philosophical?" Shinji inquired suddenly.
“你什么时候变得这么哲学了？”真嗣突然问道。

Touji scratched his nose.  "When you sit around the house all day," he said with a shrug, "you have some time to do some thinking, you know?  And since I can't exactly be the star of the basketball team anymore, I have more time to read and stuff."  He waved a hand as Shinji tried once again to apologize for his injuries.  "Anyway, the point is that sometimes a dream is just a way to remember someone, you know?  Don't let it freak you out."
冬二挠了挠鼻子。“当你整天坐在家里，”他耸耸肩说，“你就有时间思考一些事情，你知道吗？既然我不能再成为篮球队的主力了，我就有更多时间阅读和做其他事情。”他挥了挥手，示意真嗣不要再为他的伤势道歉。“总之，重点是，有时候梦只是一种记住某人的方式，你知道吗？别让它吓到你。”

There was a long moment of silence, then Shinji stood, letting out a deep sigh.  "Thanks, Touji," he said quietly.
沉默良久，真嗣站起身，深深叹了口气。“谢谢你，冬二。”他轻声说道。

"Don't mention it," the other boy said, "I mean it – don't mention it to anyone.  Can't have people knowing that I'm smart and stuff."
“别客气，”另一个男孩说，“我是认真的——别跟任何人提起。不能让人知道我聪明什么的。”

"Did I say you were?" Shinji smiled.
"我有说过你是吗？" 真嗣微笑道。

"Ouch!" Touji replied, laying back on the couch and folding his hands behind his head, "Ikari's fighting dirty.  I'd be shocked, but I think it's all that time you spend around Devil Girl."  He sighed and closed his eyes as Shinji tensed slightly.  "Never mind."
"哎哟！" 冬二回答，仰躺在沙发上，双手枕在脑后，"碇这家伙不按常理出牌。我本该惊讶的，但我想这都是因为你总和魔女待在一起。" 他叹了口气，闭上眼睛，而真嗣微微紧张起来。"别介意。"

"Hey," Shinji asked after a moment, "can I ask you something?"
"嘿，" 真嗣片刻后问道，"我能问你件事吗？"

"Yeah, sure," Touji yawned, "Why not?"
“嗯，当然，” 冬二打了个哈欠，“为什么不呢？”

Shinji hesitated, images from his dream insisting on comparing themselves to memories of Sachiko's apartment.  "It's… kinda personal," he murmured, half hoping that the other boy would tell him not to ask.
真嗣犹豫了，梦中的景象执意要与幸子公寓的记忆相比较。“这……有点私人，”他低声说，半是希望另一个男孩会告诉他不要问。

"Just say it!" the jock shouted, sitting up and glaring at the other boy. "Man, Kensuke was right – you are kind of a whiny little bitch."
“说出来吧！”那个运动员喊道，坐起身来瞪着另一个男孩。“伙计，健介说得对——你真是个爱抱怨的小婊子。”

"When did Kensuke say that?!" Shinji protested, blushing brightly.  They had visited the other boy two days prior, but he did not recall hearing anything like that – nor was Touji alone with him at any time he knew of.
"什么时候健介说过那种话？！" 真嗣抗议道，脸颊通红。他们两天前才去看望过那个男孩，但他不记得听到过类似的话——而且据他所知，东治也没有单独和他在一起过。

"He didn't, you boob!!" Touji roared, "But damned if he wasn't thinking it when we were there!  Now ask your damn question!"
"他没说过，你这个笨蛋！！" 东治吼道，"但我们在那里的时候，他肯定在心里这么想！现在问你的该死的问题吧！"

"Ok," Shinji whispered.  "How far have you gone with Hikari?"
"好吧，" 真嗣低声说，"你和光到底发展到哪一步了？"

Touji's frustration at his friend's lack of gumption was blown away in a heartbeat.  "Ummm… me and… H-Hikari…?" he stammered, totally taken off guard.  When Shinji nodded, he shrugged uncomfortably.  "We've… done a lot, I guess."  He sighed, leaning back and extending his arms on the back of the couch, getting as comfortable as he could.  "I guess I can tell you," he mused.  "You told me your dream, and I live with you and all."  He paused to formulate his thoughts, then spoke, choosing his words very carefully and looking around from time to time as if making sure no one else was listening.
真嗣对朋友缺乏勇气的沮丧在一瞬间烟消云散。“呃……我和……光……？”他结结巴巴地说，完全措手不及。当真嗣点头时，他不安地耸了耸肩。“我们……做了很多，我想。”他叹了口气，向后靠去，双臂伸展搭在沙发背上，尽可能地放松自己。“我想我可以告诉你，”他沉思道，“你告诉了我你的梦，而且我和你住在一起等等。”他停顿了一下，整理思绪，然后开口，字斟句酌，不时环顾四周，仿佛在确认没有其他人在听。

"The last time we went out, I uhhh… I prayed for her – if you know what I mean.  Yeah, don't look so embarrassed – you asked to know this stuff, tough guy.  The week before that, she did it to me," he took a deep breath, smiling broadly.  "That was awesome.  But before that, we hadn't really done too much, I guess.  We'd… you know, used our hands on each other and stuff, but she'd always back off when I tried to take her panties off."
“上次我们出去的时候，我呃……我为她祈祷了——如果你明白我的意思。是的，别那么尴尬——是你要求知道这些的，硬汉。再之前那周，她为我做了同样的事，”他深吸一口气，笑容满面。“那真是太棒了。但在此之前，我们其实没做太多，我想。我们……你知道的，互相用手抚摸对方之类的，但她总是在我试图脱掉她的内裤时退缩。”

"So, ummm," Shinji asked, wondering why he'd begun this conversation, "what changed?"
“那么，呃，”真嗣问道，疑惑自己为何开始这场对话，“是什么改变了？”

"Not really sure," Touji admitted.  "We were just in her car, and she was – god, I can't believe I'm saying this to you – she was using her hand, and then she just smiled and said, 'ready?'"  He looked up at the ceiling, his voice dropping.  "I said, 'for what?' and she just smiled… and leaned down… and opened her mouth… and…" He snapped his fingers, "Just like that."
"不太确定，" 冬二承认道。"我们就在她的车里，她当时——天啊，真不敢相信我居然在跟你说这个——她在用手，然后她笑了笑，问，'准备好了吗？'” 他抬头望向天花板，声音低了下来。“我问，'准备什么？' 她只是微笑……然后俯下身……张开嘴……然后……” 他打了个响指，“就这样。”

"Do you think you guys are gonna, you know… sometime soon?" Shinji inquired, fidgeting with the object in his pocket.
"你觉得你们会，你知道的……很快吗？" 真嗣询问道，不安地摆弄着口袋里的东西。

"No," Touji said calmly.  "Hikari told me, the very first time we really made out, that she wasn't going to have sex until she was married.  Period.  She told me that she had no problem fooling around and stuff, but if she was going to get real she was going to get real with her husband."
"不会，" 冬二平静地说。"光第一次真正亲热时告诉我，她不打算在结婚前发生性行为。就这样。她跟我说她不介意调情什么的，但如果要认真的话，她只会和她的丈夫认真。"

"So are you going to ask her to marry you?"
“所以，你打算向她求婚吗？”

Touji sighed, scrubbing his right hand through his hair.  "Yeah, someday I guess," he replied.  "Or she might ask me, I don't know.  You know how she is, man, she likes to get her way and she's patient.  She'll either wait for me to ask, or just do it herself – but I'm not gonna like, ask her just so we can fuck, I'm not that shallow."
“嗯，我想总有一天会的，”他回答道，“或者她可能会向我求婚，我也不确定。你知道她的性格，伙计，她喜欢按自己的方式来，而且很有耐心。她要么等我开口，要么自己主动——但我不会为了能上床就随便求婚，我没那么肤浅。”

Shinji nodded, thinking that he wasn't so sure Hikari would do either.  He wasn't as close to the pigtailed girl as Asuka, but he thought that there might be a third option Hikari would consider, rather than waiting for a proposal or giving one herself: finding someone else.  It seemed a bit on the unlikely side, Shinji thought, considering how open she was with her affection for Touji, but Shinji had long ago learned never to take anything for granted.
“嗯，我想总有一天会的，”他回答道，“或者她可能会向我求婚，我也不确定。你知道她的性格，伙计，她喜欢按自己的方式来，而且很有耐心。她要么等我开口，要么自己主动——但我不会为了能上床就随便求婚，我没那么肤浅。”

"So is all this about that dream?" Touji asked airily, "Or are you looking for something you can use for your date this Saturday?"
"所以这一切都是关于那个梦吗？" 东治轻松地问道，"还是你在找什么东西，好用在本周六的约会中？"

Shinji flushed.  Asuka knew about the date, of course, as she had been there when he got the call from Mitzuki to ask him.  But he had almost kept the information from Touji, fearing exactly what was happening.
真嗣脸红了。当然，明日香知道这次约会，因为她当时就在场，听到了光月打来的电话邀请他。但他几乎没告诉东治，就是担心会发生现在这样的情况。

"It's just a first date," he protested, trying to forget the fact that the last time he had been alone with a girl, it almost led to passionate, sweat-soaked lovemaking.
"这只是第一次约会，" 他辩解道，试图忘记上次他和一个女孩单独相处时，差点就发展成激情四溢、汗水淋漓的缠绵。

"Yeah," Touji shrugged.  "Maybe you'll get lucky.  I couldn't even get more than a closed-mouthed peck from Hikari until the third date – and it was months before she let me cop a feel."
"是啊，" 冬二耸了耸肩。 "也许你会走运。我直到第三次约会才从光那里得到超过闭嘴亲吻的待遇——而且过了好几个月她才让我摸一下。

Only took me twenty minutes with Sachiko, Shinji thought suddenly, trying to push the image from his mind.
我只用了二十分钟就和幸子搞定了，真嗣突然想到，试图把这画面从脑海中赶走。

"Oh," Touji added, lying on the couch, "and I expect a full report – with details – as soon as you get home.  Understood, soldier?"
"哦，" 冬二补充道，躺在沙发上， "我期待你一回家就给我一份详细的报告——要有细节。明白了吗，士兵？"

"Yes sir," Shinji laughed weakly.  "I'm gonna get to work."
"是的，先生，" 真嗣虚弱地笑了笑。 "我这就去工作。"

"See ya…" "再见…"

"See ya…" "再见…"

Sachiko decided that this particular day… was the worst of her life.  All things considered, she led a relatively peaceful life.  All of her relatives and close friends had survived both the Second and Third Impacts, giving her no reason for grief, and her boyfriend was loving, kind, and exceedingly sweet and gentle.  
幸子认定，这一天……是她一生中最糟糕的日子。总的来说，她的生活相对平静。她的所有亲戚和密友都挺过了第二次和第三次冲击，这让她没有理由感到悲伤，而她的男朋友则是充满爱心、善良，极其温柔体贴。

But that Thursday, she was the tensest she had ever been.  
但那个星期四，她紧张到了极点。

It was time to stop running.  Time to stop letting Shinji avoid her, and time for her to stop avoiding what they had done.  They needed to talk, and they needed to talk right now.  
是时候停止逃避了。是时候不再让真嗣回避她，也是她自己不再回避他们所做的事情。他们需要谈谈，而且现在就需要谈。

It was a slow night, and Mitzuki had already gone for the day, giving Shinji a smile and wave before Alexander shoved her out the door, muttering something about ungrateful people and how they should get going when he let them leave early.  It was approaching closing time when Sachiko finally steeled her nerves enough to approach the young dishwasher.  
那是个冷清的夜晚，Mitzuki 已经下班了，她在亚历山大将她推出门之前，对真嗣笑了笑并挥了挥手，亚历山大嘴里咕哝着不知感恩的人以及他们应该在他允许早退时离开。当接近打烊时分，幸子终于鼓足勇气，走向那位年轻的洗碗工。

"Shinji, can I talk to you a minute?" she asked, waiting as he dried his hands on a towel.  
“真嗣，我能和你谈一会儿吗？”她问道，等待着他用毛巾擦干双手。

"Yeah," the brown-haired boy said awkwardly, tossing the towel to the side, "what's up?"  
“嗯，”棕色头发的男孩尴尬地说，将毛巾扔到一边，“怎么了？”

"In private?" “私下里？”

Shinji stiffened.  He knew that he shouldn't, he really did.  What could happen at work – and moreover, what could happen with him so tense?  When he stopped to think about it, he questioned just why he had been avoiding the waitress.  Certainly what they had done was wrong, but they both knew that, and they had each tried very hard not to touch the other.  
真嗣僵住了。他知道自己不应该这样，真的知道。工作时会发生什么——而且，他这么紧张又能有什么好事呢？当他停下来思考时，他不禁怀疑自己为什么一直在避开那位女服务员。当然，他们所做的是错误的，但他们都明白这一点，并且都尽力避免触碰对方。

He followed in silence as the girl led him toward the back of the restaurant and through the exit, entering the narrow alleyway and waiting until the door closed before turning to regard him.  "I don't know what it is about you," the waitress murmured softly, starting the conversation without any introduction.  "I mean, you're not my type – at all.  I don't want to offend you, Shinji, but to me, you're not that cute."  She shrugged, blushing deeply and averting her eyes.  "There isn't really a good way to say that.  I just want to be honest, and really, I don't find you very attractive."  Unconsciously leaning closer, she added, "But there's something about you – and I don't know what it is – but it makes me want to be close to you."  Feeling her pulse quickening, she looked into his confused, dark blue eyes.  "Does any of this make sense?" she asked softly.  
他默默地跟随着女孩，穿过餐厅的后部，通过出口进入狭窄的巷子，直到门关上后才转身面对他。“我不知道你身上有什么，”女服务员轻声细语，没有开场白就直接开始了对话。“我是说，你不是我喜欢的类型——完全不是。我不想冒犯你，真嗣，但对我来说，你并不那么可爱。”她耸耸肩，脸颊深红，目光避开。“这么说不太好。我只是想诚实，真的，我不觉得你很有吸引力。”她无意识地靠近了一些，补充道：“但你有某种特质——我不知道是什么——但它让我想靠近你。”感到心跳加速，她凝视着他困惑的深蓝色眼睛。“这些有道理吗？”她轻声问道。

Shinji nodded slowly, trying to look away from her, but finding himself unsuccessful.  "Yeah," he replied, finally managing to look down at the concrete between them, "you, ummm… make me forget myself, somehow – it's like, I dunno, chemistry or something."  
真嗣缓缓点头，试图避开她的目光，却发现做不到。“嗯，”他终于回答，目光落在两人之间的混凝土上，“你，呃……让我忘记了自己，不知怎么的——就像，我不知道，化学反应之类的。”

"Yes!" Sachiko said, nodding vigorously, "Chemistry! That's it exactly!  There's just that… something between us that… that…" she trailed off, hopelessly lost for words.  
“是的！”幸子点头如捣蒜，“化学反应！正是如此！我们之间就是有那种……某种东西……那种……”她话音渐弱，无助地找不到合适的词汇。

"I should leave," the boy said, his voice shaking slightly, "I-"  
“我该走了，”男孩说道，声音微微颤抖，“我——”

"I don't want you to," the dark-haired girl interjected, reaching out to touch his face, "I don't want you to go – I want to know what this feeling is," she murmured.  She withdrew her hand… then slowly bought it back up.  "It scares me," she said quietly, trying to sort out what she was feeling, "but Shinji – it makes me feel so alive."  Slowly, she extended her other hand, feeling her face suffuse with color and her heart rate jump.  "I like the way it feels," she breathed, pulling him slowly closer to her, "I want to feel it again… I want more, Shinji…"  
“我不想你走，”黑发女孩打断他，伸手轻触他的脸颊，“我不想你离开——我想知道这种感觉是什么，”她低语。她收回手……然后又缓缓地伸了回来。“它让我害怕，”她轻声说，试图理清自己的感受，“但真嗣——它让我感到如此鲜活。”她慢慢伸出另一只手，感到脸颊泛红，心跳加速。“我喜欢这种感觉，”她轻声细语，缓缓将他拉近，“我想再感受一次……我想要更多，真嗣……”

"We shouldn't," Shinji whispered, his hands unconsciously finding her waist and circling it, "I'm supposed to be going out with Mitzuki this weekend, and-"  
"我们不该这样，" 真嗣低声说道，双手无意识地环住了她的腰，"这周末我本来要和光希出去的，而且——"

Abruptly, Sachiko grasped the front of his shirt, pulling his face to within inches of hers.  He could feel her breath blowing across his cheek, coming in short, shaking increments – rather like a machinegun.  "The way I feel," she managed, her teeth clenched and her eyes narrowed, giving her a sinister, almost angry appearance, "I could take you right here, Shinji – just say fuck it all and do it with you right now!"  Her expression changed almost immediately to one of confusion. "And I don't know why."  Abruptly, she pushed him away, taking a quick step back.  "I'm sorry."  
突然，幸子抓住他衬衫的前襟，将他的脸拉近到离她只有几英寸的地方。他能感觉到她的呼吸吹拂在脸颊上，急促而颤抖，宛如机关枪一般。"我现在的感觉，"她勉强说道，牙齿紧咬，眼神锐利，显得阴沉而近乎愤怒，"我可以就在这里，真嗣——就那么说去他妈的，现在就和你做！"她的表情几乎立刻变成了困惑。"我不知道为什么。"她突然推开他，迅速后退一步。"对不起。"

"It's alright," Shinji assured her, folding his arms and leaning against the wall, trying to stay calm in spite of the shaking in his arms and legs.  "I understand completely.  We just… work, somehow."  
"没关系，" 真嗣安慰她，双臂交叉靠在墙上，尽管手臂和腿都在颤抖，他还是尽力保持冷静。"我完全理解。我们只是……不知怎么地，还能继续工作。"

"Weird, isn't it?" Sachiko mused, shaking her head.  "I've got a boyfriend, you've got… Asuka and Mitzuki to work out."  She smiled weakly.  "At least you've got enough control to know that I'm not who you should be with."  
"真奇怪，不是吗？" 幸子沉思着，摇了摇头。"我有男朋友，你有……明日香和光月需要解决。" 她虚弱地笑了笑。"至少你有足够的自制力，知道我不该是你该在一起的人。"

"I'd like to say I have control," Shinji said sadly, "or that I could make any really important choices in my life."  He swallowed.  "Like this weekend, for example.  I'm not with Asuka, so I shouldn't feel guilty about going out with Mitzuki – but I do."  He sighed, shrugging in defeat.  "I don't think I can choose between someone I've known for so long, but I'm not sure about, and someone that I've just met, but definitely wants to be with me."  
"我想说我能控制自己，" 真嗣悲伤地说，"或者说我能在我生活中做出任何真正重要的选择。" 他咽了咽口水。"比如这个周末。我和明日香不在一起，所以我本不该因为和光月出去而感到内疚——但我确实感到内疚。" 他叹了口气，无奈地耸了耸肩。"我不认为我能在一位我认识很久但不确定的人和一位我刚认识却明确想要和我在一起的人之间做出选择。"

"You'll be able to," Sachiko said quietly, "I know you will, when the time comes."  
"你会做到的，" 幸子轻声说，"我相信你会在时机到来时做到的。"

"I hope," Shinji murmured, taking a step back, "that you're right… and that I can be as strong as you."  
"我希望，" 真嗣低声说道，后退了一步，"你能是对的……而我也能变得像你一样坚强。"

"I'm not strong," the waitress answered hollowly, "I'm just cold.  I can push you away… I can tell you that you mean nothing… I can insult you, tell you you're not attractive to me, and then go back to my boyfriend's house and have sex with him."  She blushed, dropping her eyes, "If that's what you mean by saying I'm strong, then your definition and my definition aren't the same."  
"我不坚强，" 女服务员空洞地回答，"我只是冷漠。我可以推开你……我可以告诉你你对我毫无意义……我可以侮辱你，告诉你我对你没有吸引力，然后回到我男朋友的家里和他发生关系。" 她脸红了，垂下眼睛，"如果你说的坚强是指这个，那么你的定义和我的定义并不一样。"

Neither of them spoke for a minute.  Sachiko fidgeted with the hem of her work skirt, staring at the ground while Shinji ran his fingers over the change in his pocket, feeling their texture and tracing the faces on the fronts.  Finally, Sachiko stepped away from the wall.  "I think I-mmmm…"  
他们沉默了一分钟。幸子摆弄着工作裙的裙边，盯着地面，而真嗣则用手指摩挲着口袋里的零钱，感受它们的质地，并描绘着硬币正面的图案。最后，幸子离开了墙壁。"我想我——嗯……"

She was interrupted as Shinji put his hands on her shoulders, leaning forward and gently kissing her.  "We shouldn't be close anymore," he murmured, releasing her and taking three steps back, "it can only end up causing pain – for you, me, Domiyoji, Mitzuki, Asuka… everyone."  
她的话被真嗣打断，他双手搭在她的肩上，倾身向前，温柔地吻了她。“我们不该再靠近了，”他低语着，松开她，退后三步，“这只会带来痛苦——对你，对我，对道明寺，对美月，对明日香……对所有人。”

Sachiko shook her head slowly, unsmiling.  "No," she whispered, "that's not going to work.  We'll still see each other every day, and there's no way for us to never be alone, or close."  She met his gaze head-on.  "And I don't want it that way.  What needs to happen," she told him, "is that we just need to keep it under control.  If we can't even control this part of our lives, how can we control any other part?"  She smiled softly.  "Besides, I love hearing you laugh.  I'd be sad if I never got to hear it again, or got to be the one that makes it happen.  So how about this, Shinji: we agree, right here and now, that we won't let something like this happen again, ok?"  
幸子缓缓摇头，脸上没有笑容。“不，”她轻声说，“那样行不通。我们每天都会见面，不可能永远不单独相处，不靠近。”她直视他的目光。“而我不想那样。需要发生的是，”她告诉他，“我们只需要控制住局面。如果我们连这一部分生活都无法控制，又怎么能控制其他部分呢？”她温柔地笑了。“而且，我喜欢听你笑。如果再也听不到，或者不能成为让你笑的人，我会很难过的。所以，真嗣，我们就在这里，现在，达成协议，不会再让这种事发生，好吗？”

"I don't think I'm that strong," the boy replied shakily, "I-"  
“我不认为我有那么坚强，”男孩颤抖地回答，“我——”

"You have to be," the waitress cut in, her voice taking on a hard edge, "and I have to be – there's no other way."  Her face softened, and she reached out, almost touching his face before slowly lowering her hand again.  "I think we can be friends," she murmured, staring at the back of her hand with a slight frown, "can't we?  I mean, are we so pathetic that we can't even manage that?  I don't think we are."  
"你得这样，"女服务员插话道，声音变得尖锐，"我也得这样——没有别的办法。"她的表情柔和下来，伸出手，几乎要触碰到他的脸，却又慢慢放下了手。"我想我们可以成为朋友，"她低声说，皱着眉头盯着自己的手背，"不是吗？我的意思是，我们难道如此可悲，连这一点都做不到吗？我不这么认为。"

Shinji studied her face for a moment.  "Guess we'll see," he said finally, "and soon – we're all going out to the movies this weekend, remember?"  
真嗣仔细打量了她一会儿。"我想我们会知道的，"他终于说道，"很快——我们这周末都要去看电影，记得吗？"

For one, horrifyingly erotic moment, Sachiko could imagine yanking Shinji into the bathroom at the theatre and having sex with him up against the door, screaming in pure, animal desire.  Then the moment passed, and she shivered, nodding.  
有那么一瞬间，可怕而又充满诱惑，幸子能想象到在电影院的洗手间里把真嗣拽进去，靠在门上与他发生关系，尖叫着表达纯粹的、动物般的欲望。但这一刻过去了，她颤抖着，点了点头。

Turning away, Shinji let out a shaky breath.  "I'm going back in," he murmured, his own thoughts running in a similar direction to the girl's – only involving the back seat of a car and a slower pace.  "On Saturday…" he trailed off, entirely at a loss for words.  
转过身去，真嗣深吸了一口气，声音有些颤抖。“我要回去了，”他低声说道，思绪与女孩的相似——只是涉及到了汽车后座和更慢的节奏。“在周六……”他话音渐弱，完全不知该如何表达。

Sachiko nodded.  "Yeah," she said, "Saturday."  
幸子点了点头。“嗯，”她说，“周六。”

Silently, Shinji walked away, leaving the girl to ponder their odd situation.  
真嗣默默地走开，留下女孩独自思索他们这奇怪的处境。

**

"So," Asuka whispered, "this is it, huh?  Just a few words on a shitty piece of marble… and she's gone."  
"所以，" 明日香低声说道，"就是这样了，对吧？仅仅几行刻在劣质大理石上的字……她就消失了。"

"There's nothing left," Shinji confirmed hollowly, "even this grave is nothing more than an artifice."  
"什么都没留下，" 真嗣空洞地确认道，"就连这座墓也不过是个人造物。"

He looked down at where Asuka knelt, her augmented hand resting on the carved obelisk that marked the final resting place of their guardian.  He pulled his eyes away from the simple inscription, already knowing it by heart:  
他低头看着明日香跪着的地方，她那经过改造的手放在标志着他们守护者长眠之地的石碑上。他移开视线，不再看那简单的铭文，因为他早已铭记于心：

"Misato Katsuragi.  Beloved guardian, friend, and mother – we will never forget you."  
"葛城美里。亲爱的守护者、朋友和母亲——我们永远不会忘记你。"

"You wrote it, didn't you?" Asuka asked.  
"是你写的，对吧？" 明日香问道。"

Shinji blinked, flushing as he realized that he had spoken the epitaph aloud.  "Yeah," he admitted, "I did."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，意识到自己不自觉地念出了墓志铭，脸颊泛红。“嗯，”他承认道，“是我写的。”

"Stupid," the Second Child whispered, her good eye running from the inscription to the alloy strips on the backs of her fingers, "she wasn't anyone's mother.  Why did you put that there?"  
"笨蛋，" 二号机驾驶员低声抱怨，她那只完好的眼睛从碑文扫到手指背上的合金条，"她又不是谁的妈。你干嘛写那个？"

Shinji cleared his throat.  "She was… kinda like a mother to me – and you, in a-"  
真嗣清了清嗓子。"她对我……有点像母亲——对你也是，在某种程度上——"

"She was nothing like my mother," Asuka cut in flatly.  
"她根本不像我妈妈，" 明日香冷冷地打断道。

Unable to read the girl's tone, Shinji simply nodded.  
无法读懂女孩的语气，真嗣只是点了点头。

"You're always doing things like that," the redhead mumbled, "always making things so deep and meaningful."  She looked up at him, neither smiling nor frowning.  "Do you know how annoying that is?  Why can't things just be what they are, Third Child?  She was your guardian – not your mother."  
“你总是这样，”红发女孩嘟囔着，“总是把事情搞得那么深沉和有意义。”她抬头看着他，既不微笑也不皱眉。“你知道这有多烦人吗？为什么事情不能就是它们本身的样子，第三适格者？她是你的监护人——不是你的母亲。”

"Well," Shinji murmured awkwardly, "we were kinda close."  
“嗯，”真嗣尴尬地低声说，“我们关系挺亲近的。”

"I know." "我知道。"

They fell silent, each lost in memories of the purple-haired woman that had given her life to save Shinji, and by extension – everyone on Earth.  Asuka knew of the kiss Misato had given Shinji before her death, but she could not say that she cared.  Why in the world would she?  If her indecent, controlling guardian wanted to spend her last few minutes of life sucking face with one of her goddamn charges, that was her business.  
他们陷入了沉默，每个人都沉浸在对那位紫发女子的回忆中，她用自己的生命拯救了真嗣，也因此间接拯救了地球上的每一个人。明日香知道美里在临死前给了真嗣一个吻，但她并不在意。她为什么要关心这种事呢？如果她那不检点、控制欲强的监护人想在生命的最后几分钟里和她的一个该死的被监护人亲热，那是她自己的事。

"So," Asuka mused, "tomorrow's your date."  
“所以，”明日香若有所思地说，“明天是你的约会。”

Shinji looked at her closely, but he could not interpret her expression.  "Yeah," he said cautiously.  "We're gonna go see Shadow's Fall."  
真嗣仔细地看着她，却无法解读她的表情。“嗯，”他谨慎地回答，“我们要去看《影之瀑布》。”

"Isn't that a horror movie, Third Child?" the redhead asked skeptically, slowly lowering her hand to her lap.  "I thought you didn't like scary stories."  
"那不是一部恐怖电影吗，三号机？" 红发女孩怀疑地问道，缓缓将手放回膝上。"我以为你不喜欢恐怖故事。"

"Well," Shinji admitted, "they're not my favorite.  Mitzuki picked it out."  
"嗯，" 真嗣承认道，"它们不是我的最爱。 光子选的。"

"Of course," Asuka said coolly, "Lord knows you would never make a choice."  
"当然，" 明日香冷冷地说，"天知道你永远不会做选择。"

"What do you m-"  
"你想说什——"

"Forget it." "算了。"

Shinji stared at his feet.  "Maybe…"  
真嗣盯着他的脚。  "也许……"

"What?" Asuka frowned as he trailed off.  "Maybe what?"  
"什么？" 明日香皱眉，他话没说完。"也许什么？"

"Maybe we could… go see something next week," Shinji murmured awkwardly, "you and me."  
"也许我们下周可以去……看什么东西，" 真嗣尴尬地低声说，"就你和我。"

Asuka's eyes flashed. 明日香的眼睛一亮。

"Should I see if maybe Hikari wants to go out with you the week after that?" she growled.  "A different girl for every week? No!" She rose to her feet, stepping past the agitated-looking boy as her hands clenched at her sides.  "Maybe a different one for every _day_ of the week!  Forget it, Third Child; I'm not going to be your second option.  I'm going home."  
"要不要我看看下下周光愿不愿意跟你出去？" 她咆哮道，"每周换一个女孩？不行！" 她站起身来，从那个看起来焦躁不安的男孩身边走过，双手紧握在身侧。"或许每天换一个！算了吧，第三子；我不会成为你的第二选择。我要回家了。"

Shinji bowed his head as the girl walked quickly from the graveyard.  
真嗣低下头，看着女孩快步离开墓地。

"Why did I say yes?" he whispered miserably.  
"我为什么要答应？" 他痛苦地低语。

Slowly, he knelt by his guardian's grave, running one hand over the epitaph… and the other over the object in his pocket.  
他缓缓跪在守护者的墓前，一只手抚过墓碑上的铭文……另一只手则轻触口袋中的物品。

**

Saturday was chilly, for Tokyo-2.  
周六的东京-2 有些寒意。

Certainly, when held up against other cities, fifty-eight degrees was by no means freezing, but when the average temperature was a constant eighty to ninety, fifty-eight had a way of feeling like forty.  
当然，与其他城市相比，五十八度绝不算冷，但当平均气温恒定在八十到九十度时，五十八度便让人感觉像是四十度了。

Shinji met Mitzuki, Sachiko, and Domiyoji at the theatre, declining the offer to have them pick him up.  He knew that Mitzuki, at least, was curious about where he and his roommates (or rather, her competition) lived, but Shinji had decided when he agreed to go out with them that he did not want Home and Work mixing.  
真嗣在剧院遇到了光希、幸子和大道寺，婉拒了他们来接他的提议。他知道至少光希对他和他的室友们（或者说，她的竞争对手们）的住处感到好奇，但真嗣在答应和他们出去时就决定了，他不想让家和工作混在一起。

It just felt wrong.  
这感觉就是不对。

"Shinji!" Mitzuki called happily, waving as the boy approached the theatre and headed towards the ticket booth.  "Come on!  We already got tickets."  
“真嗣！”光希开心地喊道，挥着手，当男孩走近剧院并朝售票处走去时。“快来！我们已经买好票了。”

Shinji nodded, shivering slightly as he hurried over to the trio awaiting him.  "How much was it?" he asked, reaching for his wallet.  
真嗣点点头，微微颤抖着快步走向等待他的三人。“多少钱？”他问道，伸手去拿钱包。

"Don't be silly!" Mitzuki giggled, grabbing his hand and pulling him into the lobby.  
“别傻了！”光希咯咯笑着，抓住他的手把他拉进大厅。

Shinji tried to protest, but he found himself unable as Domiyoji shook his hand and clapped him on the shoulder.  "Hey Ikari," he said with a grin, "finally managed to get Mitzuki out of her little shell huh?  Nice job!  We were starting to wonder if she was ever going to-"  
真嗣试图抗议，但发现自己无法开口，因为道明寺握住他的手并拍了拍他的肩膀。“嘿，碇，”他咧嘴一笑，“终于让光希走出她的小壳了，是吧？干得不错！我们都开始怀疑她是不是永远不会——”

"Let's get some seats," Mitzuki cut in, grabbing the boy by the arm, "I wanna talk to you about something I like to call – shut the hell up."  She turned to Sachiko.  "You guys grab the drinks, k?"  
"我们去找些座位吧，" 光月插话道，抓住男孩的手臂，"我有件事想跟你谈谈，我称之为——闭嘴。" 她转向幸子。"你们去拿饮料，好吗？"

Sachiko immediately moved away from Shinji, heading for the concession stand without a word.  Shinji caught up a moment later, avoiding the young woman's eyes until she spoke.  
幸子立刻从真嗣身边走开，一言不发地朝小卖部走去。真嗣过了一会儿才追上她，避开年轻女子的目光，直到她开口。

"It's fine, Shinji." "没事的，真嗣。"

Shinji started.  "Ummm… what?"  
真嗣一惊。  "呃…什么？"

"I said it's fine," Sachiko murmured, looking over the candy in the display case.  "We can do this," she looked up and offered him a weak smile.  "Just don't lean over in the middle of the movie and slip me the tongue, and I think we'll be just fine – I know we will."  
"我说没事的，" 幸子低声说道，目光扫过展示柜里的糖果。  "我们可以做到的，" 她抬头给了他一个勉强的微笑。  "只要别在电影中途靠过来偷偷伸舌头，我想我们就会没事的——我知道我们会的。"

Something about the waitress's determined expression convinced Shinji that she, at least, believed what she was saying.  Nodding, he placed his order, buying two drinks and some popcorn, and followed her into the theatre.  
女服务员坚定的表情让真嗣相信，至少她自己对这番话深信不疑。 他点点头，点了两杯饮料和一些爆米花，跟着她进了影院。

**

True to her word, Sachiko barely looked Shinji's way.  She spent the length of the movie talking quietly with Domiyoji and giving him soft, deep kisses.  
正如她所承诺的，幸村几乎没有看真嗣一眼。她整场电影都在小声地和道明寺交谈，并不时给他温柔深情的吻。

Mitzuki, on the other hand, was riveted by the cheap horror onscreen, and screamed at several of the tenser moments, grasping Shinji's arm as if by reflex.  
另一方面，美月则被屏幕上的廉价恐怖片深深吸引，在几个紧张时刻尖叫出声，几乎是本能地抓住了真嗣的手臂。

For the last scene, she kept her hand on his arm.  
在最后一幕时，她一直把手放在他的手臂上。

"This was fun," Domiyoji said amicably as they exited the theatre.  His arm, Shinji noticed, was firmly wrapped around Sachiko's waist. "We should do it again sometime."  
"这很有趣，" 道明寺友好地说着，他们走出了剧院。 他的手臂，真治注意到，紧紧地搂着幸子的腰。 "我们应该找个时间再来一次。"

"Definitely!" Mitzuki agreed, nodding vigorously.  
"当然！" 光希赞同道，用力地点头。

"You guys want a ride?" Sachiko inquired, leaning her head against her boyfriend's shoulder, her eyes lidded and drowsy.  "Or are you gonna walk?"  
"你们要搭车吗？" 幸子问道，将头靠在男友的肩膀上，眼睛半闭，显得有些困倦。 "还是你们要走路？"

Shinji looked confused until Mitzuki said, "We'll just walk… g'night."  As they parted company, she explained, "I only live three blocks from here."  
真嗣看起来有些困惑，直到光希说：“我们走回去吧……晚安。” 当他们分别时，她解释道：“我就住在离这儿三个街区的地方。”

"Ahh," Shinji nodded, falling in step at the girl's side as they started to walk and offering no protest as she took his hand in hers.  He looked back over his shoulder, but Sachiko was not looking his way.  
“啊，”真嗣点头，与女孩并肩开始步行，没有反对她牵起他的手。他回头望去，但幸子并没有看向他。

"I had a good time tonight," Mitzuki told him after they had walked a block.  "I'd like to go out again sometime."  
“今晚我过得很开心，”光希在他们走过一个街区后对他说，“我想改天再一起出去。”

Finding that he had no real reason to say no, Shinji simply nodded.  
发现并没有真正拒绝的理由，真嗣只是点了点头。

They fell into silence until they reached Mitzuki's street.  "I've got a tattoo," she piped up suddenly, smiling as Shinji looked at her.  "Did I ever tell you that?"  
他们陷入沉默，直到抵达光月所在的街道。“我有个纹身，”她突然说道，微笑着看向真嗣。“我告诉过你吗？”

"No," the boy admitted, wondering suddenly if anyone else he knew had one.  
“没有，”男孩承认道，突然好奇是否还有其他人他认识的也有纹身。

"Sachiko's got one, too," Mitzuki grinned as if reading his mind.  "Of course, hers is in a different place."  
"Sachiko 也有一个，" Mitzuki 咧嘴笑道，仿佛看穿了他的心思。"当然，她的在不同的地方。"

A brief flash of memory tickled Shinji's mind.  Bare skin… quickened breath… hands covering places that should never have been uncovered.  He thought, maybe, that he could recall a line of some shape peeking out between a thumb and a forefinger, but he quickly shook his head, trying to clear the memory before it could become too much of a focus.  
一段短暂的记忆轻轻触动了 Shinji 的思绪。裸露的皮肤…急促的呼吸…双手遮掩着本不该暴露的部位。他想，或许能回忆起一条线状的痕迹在拇指和食指间若隐若现，但他很快摇了摇头，试图在记忆变得过于集中之前将其清除。

"Anyway," Mitzuki went on, "wanna see it?"  
"总之，" Mitzuki 继续说道，"想看看吗？"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"Here," Mitzuki sighed, "gimme your hand."  Not waiting for the boy's consent, she grabbed his hand, leading it to edge of her shirt, and under.  
"Here," 光月叹了口气，"把手给我。" 没等男孩同意，她便抓住他的手，引向她的衬衫边缘，然后伸了进去。

"W-what are you doing?" Shinji gasped.  
"你、你在做什么？" 真嗣倒抽一口气。

"There," Mitzuki said with some satisfaction, "feel that?"  
"那里，" 光月带着几分满意说道，"感觉到了吗？"

Shinji frowned, feeling a slightly raised pattern on the girl's skin.  "What is it?" he asked curiously as she moved his fingers over it.  "It feels like a character."  
真嗣皱了皱眉，感觉到女孩皮肤上微微凸起的图案。“这是什么？”他好奇地问道，她引导着他的手指在上面移动。“感觉像是个汉字。”

"You're so smart," the young woman grinned, keeping his hand against her skin, "it's the Chinese character for 'powerful.'  I got it the day after I filed for divorce… as a reminder that no one has power over me – I'm my own person."  She smiled as Shinji slowly drew his hand back.  "Come in for a little while?  I don't want to say goodnight yet, Shinji, ok?"  
“你真聪明，”年轻女子笑着，让他的手继续贴在她的皮肤上，“这是中文的‘强大’二字。我在申请离婚后的第二天纹上的……提醒我自己，没有人能控制我——我是独立的个体。”她微笑着，看着真嗣慢慢抽回手。“进来坐一会儿好吗？我还不想说晚安，真嗣，好吗？”

The boy stole a glance at his watch, finding that it was still rather early.  He frowned slightly as he recalled what happened the last time he had been invited into a girl's apartment.  
男孩偷偷看了一眼手表，发现时间还早。他微微皱眉，回想起上次被邀请进女孩公寓时发生的事情。

Sensing his apprehension, Mitzuki grabbed his hand.  "Come on," she said lightly, pulling him through the door, "I want you to see my place."  
察觉到他的不安，Mitzuki 抓住了他的手。“来吧，”她轻松地说道，拉着他穿过门，“我想让你看看我的地方。”

Shinji swallowed.  Come on, he thought, mentally crossing his fingers, no big deal –  just a quick look around, then I'll go home.  
Shinji 咽了咽口水。来吧，他在心里交叉手指，没什么大不了的——只是快速看看，然后我就回家。

The look around took rather longer than Shinji had anticipated, since Mitzuki's house was substantially larger than Sachiko's apartment.  She also had comments on each room, pointing out details she thought he might find interesting.  A picture in the dining room… a statue in one of the guest bedrooms… the large, four-poster bed that dominated the master bedroom.  
这次参观比 Shinji 预想的要长得多，因为 Mitzuki 的房子比 Sachiko 的公寓要大得多。她对每个房间都有评论，指出她认为他可能会感兴趣的细节。餐厅里的一幅画……一间客房里的雕像……主卧室里那张占据主导地位的四柱床。

Mitzuki smiled as her guest seemed to relax somewhat.  "Want a drink?" she asked as they finally stopped in the living room, "I've got a little bottle of amaretto I've been holding on to… I could-"  
Mitzuki 微笑着，她的客人似乎放松了一些。“想喝点什么吗？”她们终于在客厅停下时，她问道，“我有一小瓶阿玛雷托酒，一直留着呢……我可以——”

"I really shouldn't," Shinji said quickly, blushing as the waitress frowned.  "Sorry, I just don't think I want to start drinking yet."  
“我真的不该喝，”Shinji 迅速说道，脸红着，女服务员皱起了眉头。“抱歉，我只是觉得我还不想开始喝酒。”

"Fair enough," Mitzuki replied, gently pulling him down on the couch next to her, "but you have to sit a while and talk to me, since you won't join me in a drink – it's bad manners to just leave after a tour, you know."  
“那也好，”Mitzuki 回答，温柔地把他拉到身边的沙发上，“但你得坐下来和我聊一会儿，既然你不和我一起喝酒——参观完就走是不礼貌的，你知道的。”

"It is?" Shinji asked skeptically.  
"真的吗？" 真嗣怀疑地问道。

"It is," Mitzuki confirmed with a wink, "and besides – you haven't seen my tattoo."  
"真的，" 光希眨眼确认道，"而且——你还没见过我的纹身呢。"

Shinji blinked as the young woman pulled her shirt halfway up, turning slightly to offer him a better view of her back, and revealing the underside of the lavender bra she was wearing.  "Why… there?" he asked hesitantly, noting that if the tattoo was another inch higher she would have needed to pull her bra up too.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，只见年轻女子将上衣拉起一半，微微侧身以便他更好地看到她的背部，露出了她所穿的薰衣草色胸罩的下缘。"为什么……在那里？" 他犹豫地问道，注意到如果纹身再高出一寸，她可能就需要把胸罩也拉起来了。

"Because it hurt," Mitzuki replied quietly, keeping her shirt up.  "It's right on one of my ribs… and it hurt like hell.  I wanted to make sure I would never forget that it was there – or what it was supposed to mean."  She grinned, leaning a bit closer.  "Wanna touch it again?  I like the way it feels when it gets touched.  The skin is more sensitive there."  
"因为很疼，" 光月轻声回答，依旧将衬衫撩起。"正好在我的肋骨上……疼得要命。我想确保自己永远不会忘记它的存在——以及它所代表的意义。" 她咧嘴一笑，稍稍靠近了些。"想再摸摸看吗？我喜欢被触碰时的感觉。那里的皮肤更敏感。"

"N-no thanks," Shinji stammered, looking away.  
"不，不用了，谢谢，" 真嗣结巴着，移开了视线。

Mitzuki sighed and lowered her shirt, though she tried to stay as close to him as she could.  "Thanks for taking me out," she said softly, putting her hand over his.  "I'd like to go again some time, Shinji, I had a great time."  
光月叹了口气，放下衬衫，尽管她尽量保持与他靠近。"谢谢你带我出来，" 她柔声说道，把手放在他的手上。"真嗣，我希望以后还能一起去，今天我过得很开心。"

"Ummm, alright," Shinji answered uncertainly, getting to his feet.  I should talk to Asuka about this, he thought, blushing, Just to see if she… his thoughts trailed off as Mitzuki smiled, reminding him that he had no real obligation to tell the redhead anything.  
"嗯，好吧，" 真嗣不确定地回答，站起身来。我应该和明日香谈谈这件事，他想着，脸红了，只是想看看她是否……他的思绪随着美月纪的微笑而中断，提醒他并没有真正义务告诉红发女孩任何事情。

"Talk to me," she whispered, keeping his hand.  "Don't leave yet."  
"跟我聊聊，" 她低声说，握住他的手。"别急着走。"

"Ok," Shinji said hesitantly, casting around for a topic of discussion.  "I guess, I was wondering… if I could I ask you something?"  
"好的，" 真嗣犹豫地说，四处寻找话题。"我想，我在想……我能问你点什么吗？"

Mitzuki nodded, smiling softly.  
光月点了点头，温柔地微笑着。

"Can I ask why you wear that?"  
“我能问一下你为什么戴那个吗？”

Mitzuki blushed as he tilted his head forward, indicating the bandana she wore.  "I'll show you," she whispered reluctantly.  
光月脸红着，微微低头示意她戴的头巾。“我会给你看的，”她不情愿地低声说道。

The brown-haired boy watched with avid curiosity as the waitress reached up and slowly pulled the bandana off, revealing a head full of short purple hair, barely long enough to touch the tops of her ears.  Kinda like Misato's, he thought absently, wondering why this was a big deal to her, little bit lighter, though.  
棕发男孩好奇地注视着，只见女服务员伸手缓缓摘下头巾，露出一头短短的紫色头发，长度仅够触及耳尖。有点像美里小姐的，他漫不经心地想着，不明白这对她来说为何如此重要，不过颜色稍浅一些。

The young woman fidgeted nervously for a moment as he studied her, fighting the urge to retie her bandana and run away.  Don't make fun of me, she thought desperately, dropping her eyes, please don't call me a freak…  
年轻女子在他审视的目光下紧张地扭动着，强忍着重新系上头巾逃跑的冲动。别取笑我，她绝望地想着，垂下眼帘，请不要叫我怪胎……

Shinji finally shrugged.  "Umm, ok," he murmured.  
真嗣终于耸了耸肩。“嗯，好吧，”他低声说道。

"It… doesn't bother you?" Mitzuki asked cautiously.  
"这…你不介意吗？" 光月小心翼翼地问道。

The former Third Child blinked in confusion.  "Why would it?" he wondered.  He had lived with a woman with purple hair, and fought beside a girl with blue hair… and for the life of him he could not understand why it was an issue.  
前第三适格者困惑地眨了眨眼。"为什么会介意？" 他想。他曾与一位紫发女性共同生活，并与一位蓝发少女并肩作战…他怎么也想不通这有什么问题。

"It's my natural color," Mitzuki explained awkwardly.  
"这是我的自然发色，" 光月尴尬地解释道。

"Ok," Shinji replied, his tone clearly showing that he was still confused.  
“好吧，”真嗣回答，语气明显透露出他仍然困惑。

"But, but it's unnatural," Mitzuki protested, "no one has purple hair – it's just weird."  
“但是，这很不自然，”光月抗议道，“没有人有紫色的头发——这太奇怪了。”

Shinji frowned slightly, getting the oddest impression that she wanted him to be upset about this.  "If you say so."  
真嗣微微皱眉，有种奇怪的感觉，好像她希望他对此感到不快。“如果你这么说的话。”

"Sit down," Mitzuki said softly.  
“坐下，”光月轻声说道。

Doing what he was told, Shinji retook his seat on the couch, noting absently that it was the same kind Sachiko owned.  
真嗣按照吩咐重新坐回沙发上，不经意间注意到这沙发和幸子家的那款一模一样。

Mitzuki was quiet for a long moment, deciding just how to start.  Ultimately, she concluded that the straightforward approach was best.  "I was born with this hair color," she said quietly.  "Kids in school used to make fun of me for it, but my parents wouldn't let me wear hats or dye it or anything like that – they said I had to be proud of who I am."  She sighed, running a hand through her hair.  "Then my husband… he made me dye it brown.  He said it made him sick to look at it."  
光月沉默良久，思索着如何开口。最终，她认为直截了当的方式最为合适。“我天生就是这种发色，”她轻声说道，“学校里的孩子们常因此取笑我，但我的父母不允许我戴帽子或染发——他们说，我必须为自己感到骄傲。”她叹了口气，用手梳理着头发，“后来，我的丈夫……他让我染成了棕色。他说看到我的发色让他感到恶心。”

"That's horrible," Shinji said honestly, "I don't think it's weird at all!"  
“那太可怕了，”真嗣真诚地说，“我一点也不觉得奇怪！”

The young woman smiled at him.  "You really don't, do you?" she asked wonderingly.  
年轻女子对他微笑。“你真的不觉得奇怪，是吗？”她好奇地问道。

It was odd, she mused, that her ex-husband had been so bothered by it.  She knew now, of course, that the reason he was bothered was that he didn't care about her – as a person – at all.  She was just a tool to him, a pretty little trophy to keep around the house for chores… chores and sex.  
她暗自思忖，前夫对此如此介怀真是奇怪。当然，她现在明白了，他之所以介怀是因为他根本不在乎她——作为一个人的她。她对他来说只是一个工具，一个漂亮的小奖杯，放在家里做家务……家务和性。

"No," Shinji shook his head, "I think it looks pretty."  
“不，” 真嗣摇了摇头，“我觉得它很漂亮。”

Mitzuki smiled, biting her bottom lip for a moment and studying his face closely.  "It's been really hard to deal with," she said slowly, putting her hand over his, "people have made fun of me my whole life – but you don't think I should hide it, do you?"  
光月微笑着，咬了咬下唇，仔细端详着他的脸。“这真的很难面对，”她缓缓地说，把手放在他的手上，“我一生中总有人取笑我——但你并不认为我应该隐藏它，对吗？”

Shinji looked down at her hand, then slowly up into her bright green eyes, shaking his head slowly. "No," he replied after a moment of quiet, feeling the slightest bit nervous as she stared at him, "I think you should be who you are.  You can handle what life throws at you – I think you're really strong."  
真嗣低头看着她的手，然后缓缓抬起头，迎上她明亮的绿色眼睛，慢慢地摇了摇头。“不，”他沉默片刻后回答，感觉到她在凝视他时略微有些紧张，“我认为你应该做你自己。你能应对生活抛给你的一切——我觉得你真的很坚强。”

In the time they had worked together, he had formed a pretty solid opinion of her – and that opinion didn't include images of her sniveling or whining because someone was insulting her hair color, of all things.  It wasn't that he didn't feel bad about her being teased and ridiculed, but he knew that making a big deal over it was unnecessary, as it would embarrass her.  
在他们共事的时间里，他对她形成了一个相当坚定的看法——而这个看法并不包括她因为别人嘲笑她的发色而哭泣或抱怨的画面。这并不是说他不觉得她被取笑和嘲讽很糟糕，而是他知道对此大惊小怪没有必要，因为这会让她难堪。

It would embarrass her… and him, as well – because he would feel the need to comfort her and he didn't think that she wanted that, nor did he think he knew her well enough.  
这会让她难堪……也会让他难堪——因为他会感到需要安慰她，而他既不认为她想要那样，也不认为自己足够了解她。

Mitzuki's thoughts, on the other hand, were running an entirely different direction.  "You know what I like about you?" she asked quietly, smiling as she added, "Well, I like a lot of things about you, but what I like most about you?"  Shinji shook his head.  "You always think before you speak."  She leaned forward suddenly, putting her hands on his face.   
另一方面，Mitzuki 的想法则完全不同。“你知道我喜欢你什么吗？”她轻声问道，微笑着补充道，“嗯，我喜欢你很多地方，但我最喜欢你什么？” 真嗣摇了摇头。“你总是三思而后言。”她突然前倾，双手捧住他的脸。

"Another thing I like is your lips…"  
"另一件我喜欢的事是你的唇……"

Shinji's eyes widened as Mitzuki closed her eyes, kissing him softly on the lips she had just mentioned her affinity for.  
当 Mitzuki 闭上眼睛，轻轻吻上她刚刚提及喜欢的他的唇时，真嗣的眼睛睁大了。

"Mmmm," she hummed, breaking away slowly, "I've thought about doing that for three weeks now, Shinji."  She leaned forward again, barely grazing his lips with hers.  "Do you want to do more…?"  
"嗯……"她缓缓分开，轻声哼道，"三周以来，我一直在想这么做，真嗣。"她再次前倾，轻轻触碰他的唇。"你想做更多吗……？"

Shinji swallowed, feeling short of breath as what had been a rather light discussion of hair color became something entirely unexpected.  "Ummm… more?"  
真嗣咽了咽口水，原本只是轻松讨论发色的对话突然变得出乎意料，让他感到呼吸急促。“嗯……更多？”

Mitzuki nodded, taking his hand and kissing the palm lightly.  "There's no one here," she murmured, breathing softly against his hand, "and… I think you're great, Shinji."  She smiled, placing his hand against her waist.  "So, up or down," she whispered, closing her eyes, "either way is ok."  
光月点了点头，握住他的手，轻轻吻了一下掌心。“这里没有别人，”她低声呢喃，轻柔的气息拂过他的手，“而且……我觉得你很棒，真嗣。”她微笑着，将他的手放在自己的腰间。“那么，向上还是向下，”她闭上眼睛轻声说，“都可以。”

"I…" Shinji kept his hand perfectly still, "I don't think we should," he said quietly.  
“我……”真嗣保持着手一动不动，“我觉得我们不应该，”他轻声说道。

"Why?" the girl asked, opening her eyes and frowning slightly, "you're not seeing anyone, right?" she waited for him to nod.  "So what's the problem?  Am I… not pretty enough for you?"  
"为什么？" 女孩问道，睁开眼睛并微微皱眉，"你又没有在和谁交往，对吧？" 她等待着他点头。"那有什么问题呢？难道我……不够漂亮吗？"

"No!" Shinji said quickly, "It's not that at all! I just…"  I want this to be with Asuka!  
"不！" 真嗣迅速回答，"根本不是那样！我只是……" 我想要和明日香在一起！"

"I'll tell you something," Mitzuki whispered, "my husband was the first person I ever slept with, and I did it because he was so demanding and sure of himself… but he never loved me, Shinji, no matter how hard I tried, I was never good enough for him."  She reached out and gently caressed his face, smiling softly, "But you… you're always nice to me – to everyone – and I think…" she started leaning closer to him, her voice lowering as she went on, "I might… be falling for you, Shinji."  
"我告诉你一件事，" 光希低声说，"我丈夫是我第一个发生关系的人，我这么做是因为他那么强势且自信……但他从未爱过我，真嗣，无论我多么努力，我始终无法让他满意。" 她伸出手，温柔地抚摸他的脸颊，微笑着，"但你……你总是对我和大家都很好——我想……" 她开始向他靠近，声音越来越低，"我可能……在对你动心，真嗣。"

Shinji opened his mouth to reply, but found himself being kissed before he could speak.  There was nothing demanding about the way she kissed him – none of the animalistic drive that had fueled the kiss between him and Sachiko – but it was still warm, and soft, and very human.  He closed his eyes, trying to sort out his feelings.  
真嗣张开嘴想要回答，却发现自己在说话前被吻住了。她的吻中没有任何强求——不像他和 Sachiko 之间的那个吻那样充满兽性的冲动——但依然温暖、柔软，非常人性化。他闭上眼睛，试图理清自己的感受。

In the cemetery, he thought, Asuka made it pretty clear that I meant nothing to her.  He tried to stay focused as Mitzuki put her hands on his chest and gently pushed back, easing him into a reclining position on the couch.  I can't keep pretending she'll ever want to be with me.  
在墓地里，他想，明日香已经很清楚地表明我对她毫无意义。他努力保持专注，当 Mitzuki 把手放在他胸前，温柔地推着他，让他缓缓躺倒在沙发上时。我不能再假装她会愿意和我在一起。

"If you're worried about work," Mitzuki whispered, breaking away and moving down to kiss his neck, "don't be – I'll keep it between us, Shinji, no one will ever know if you don't want them to."  
“如果你担心工作，”Mitzuki 低声说道，离开他的唇，移到他的脖颈处亲吻，“别担心——我会保密，真嗣，如果你不想让别人知道，他们永远不会知道。”

Shinji nodded absently.  I guess I should have known, he thought tiredly, maybe… maybe I just WANTED to be in love with her.  
真嗣心不在焉地点了点头。我想我早该知道，他疲惫地想，也许……也许我只是想爱上她。

Mitzuki moaned softly as she felt the boy's hand slowly moving against her side, resisting the urge to take his hand and guide it where she wanted it to be.  "You're perfect," she breathed, shivering slightly as his fingers once more traced her tattoo.  "God, Shinji… I've been looking for someone like you for so long."  
当她感觉到男孩的手缓缓在她腰侧移动时，光月轻声呻吟，强忍着抓住他的手引导到她想要的地方的冲动。“你太完美了，”她喘息着，微微颤抖，他的手指再次划过她的纹身。“天啊，真嗣……我找像你这样的人找了好久。”

The former Third Child said nothing, still confused about what he truly wanted – in life, and in this situation.  He couldn't contain a small gasp, however, as the young woman placed her hand on the front of his pants, slowly reaching up to grasp the tab of his zipper.  
前第三适格者没有说话，仍然对自己真正想要的东西感到困惑——无论是生活还是这种情况。然而，当年轻女子把手放在他的裤裆前，慢慢向上抓住他的拉链时，他忍不住发出了一声轻微的惊呼。

"We shouldn't… go all the way tonight," Mitzuki whispered huskily, "I don't want you to think I'm a tramp."  She finished unfastening his pants, smiling languidly, "But I do want you to know… that I want you."  
"我们今晚不该……做到最后，" 光月低声沙哑地说，"我不想让你觉得我是个随便的人。" 她缓缓地解开他的裤子，微笑着慵懒地说，"但我确实想让你知道……我想要你。"

Shinji decided suddenly that perhaps this wasn't the best idea, and took a breath to tell the woman that there was no rush… but before he could speak, she leaned down and gently took his breath away.  
真嗣突然觉得这可能不是个好主意，深吸一口气想告诉女人不必急于一时……但在他开口之前，她俯身下来，温柔地夺走了他的呼吸。

Haven't even done this, have you? Mitzuki thought as the boy gasped, I've got so many things to show you, Shinji… just be nice to me, and I'll show you how good it can be.  
你甚至还没做过这种事，对吧？光月心想，当男孩喘息时，我有很多东西要教你，真嗣……只要对我好一点，我会让你知道这有多美好。

She forced herself to slow down, afraid that she might send him over the top too fast.  If she made it last, she reasoned, it would be far more memorable – and she wanted him to remember her.  Yes, she decided, she wanted him to think of her as much as possible, and to want to be with her.  She wanted to be his fantasy – never mind why, for now, but if she could get him to think of her when he thought of pleasure… maybe he would start thinking of her when he thought of companionship, as well.  
她强迫自己放慢节奏，生怕太快让他达到高潮。如果她能让这一刻持续得更久，她想，那将会更加难忘——而她希望他能记住她。是的，她决定，她希望他能尽可能多地想起她，并渴望与她在一起。她想成为他的幻想——暂且不论原因，但如果她能让他想到快乐时也想到她……也许他开始想到伴侣时也会想到她。

It was a complicated, slightly skewed way to look at the world, she would admit to herself later, but she could not help but feel that it was true.  And she could not deny that she loved the sounds she was coaxing from the boy's throat – so passionate and lustful!  When they did have sex, she knew, he would be the kind of man that could not hide his pleasure.  Making love to him would be satisfying and long-lasting, because she would be able to prolong it by slowing the pace when he was getting close.  
她后来会向自己承认，这是一种复杂且稍显扭曲的世界观，但她无法不觉得这是真的。她无法否认她喜欢从男孩喉咙里引出的声音——如此热情和充满欲望！当他们真的发生关系时，她知道，他会是那种无法隐藏自己快乐的男人。与他做爱将会是令人满足且持久的，因为她可以通过在他接近高潮时放慢节奏来延长这一过程。

Control, her ex-husband had taught her, was everything.  
控制，她的前夫曾教导她，是一切的关键。

She eased herself down on the couch, giving him her full attention.  
她轻轻地坐到沙发上，全神贯注地看着他。

"Mit…zuki…" Shinji gasped, his hands grasping the couch as he felt her increase her tempo, "you'd… better stop, or I'm going to…"  
“美…月…” 真嗣喘息着，双手紧抓着沙发，随着她加快节奏，他感到自己快要失控，“你…最好停下来，否则我就要…”

"Mmmm…" the waitress murmured, pulling away from him briefly as he gasped, unable to complete his thought, "I hope so."  
"嗯……" 女服务员轻声呢喃，短暂地从他身边抽离，他喘息着，无法说完他的想法，"我希望如此。"

A few more seconds… and it was all over.  
再过几秒……一切就都结束了。

"Let me get a towel," Mitzuki murmured, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand as she drew back, "we… ummm… kinda made a mess."  She blushed, smiling as she rose and headed towards the bathroom.  
"让我拿条毛巾，" 光月低语道，用手背擦了擦嘴，退开时说，"我们……呃……有点弄得一团糟。" 她脸颊泛红，微笑着起身走向浴室。

As soon as she was out of the room, Shinji closed his eyes, covering his face with his hands... and wondering why he had ever decided to stop Instrumentality.  It was too hard – too hard to figure life out.  He thought he understood when Asuka had touched him, but now he wasn't so sure.  Certainly, what Mitzuki had just done to him was pleasurable, but it had made him feel confused – and just the slightest bit… dirty.  
她一离开房间，真嗣便闭上眼睛，双手掩面……心中疑惑自己当初为何决定停止人类补完计划。生活太过艰难——难以理解。他曾以为在明日香触碰他时已经明白了，但现在他不太确定了。诚然，光月刚才对他所做之事令人愉悦，却也让他感到困惑——甚至隐约有些……肮脏。

Maybe more than just a bit.  
或许不止一点。

"Here," the young woman offered, smiling as she returned with a small hand towel and a dry shirt, "or do you want me to do it for you?"  
“给，”年轻女子微笑着递来一条小手巾和一件干爽的衬衫，“还是你想让我帮你？”

"That's ok," Shinji said quickly, blushing as he took the towel, "I'll just… get cleaned up in the bathroom."  
“没关系，”真嗣迅速说道，脸颊泛红地接过毛巾，“我这就去…洗个澡。”

Mitzuki nodded, waiting to speak until he stood, awkwardly covering himself with the towel.  "I'm sorry," she said softly, keeping her smile, "I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me, Shinji.  I just," she shrugged, "I think you're incredible… and I love being with you."  Reaching out, she ran a hand over his chest, sighing slightly, "Do you understand why I did… what I did?"  
光月点了点头，等他站起来，尴尬地用毛巾遮住自己后才开口。“对不起，”她轻声说道，保持着微笑，“我不想让你对我有误解，真嗣。我只是，”她耸了耸肩，“我觉得你很了不起…而且我喜欢和你在一起。”她伸出手，轻轻抚过他的胸膛，微微叹息，“你能理解我为什么这么做吗？”

Shinji looked at the floor, shaking his head reluctantly.  
真嗣看着地板，不情愿地摇了摇头。

"It's ok," the waitress whispered, "it doesn't really make a lot of sense – but I'll try and explain it."  She put her finger under his chin and gently raised his face, looking into his eyes as she explained, "You're… amazing, to me.  You're so quiet and shy all the time – except when you're with your friends, then when you smile…"  
"没事的，" 女服务员低声说道，"这确实不太好理解——但我尽量解释给你听。" 她用手指托住他的下巴，轻轻抬起他的脸，注视着他的眼睛解释道，"你……对我来说很特别。你总是那么安静害羞——除了和朋友们在一起时，那时你微笑的样子……"

Shinji frowned as she trailed off, trying to make sense of what he was hearing.  I'm still me, he thought as he waited for her to continue, it's not like I'm two different people.  
真嗣皱着眉头，试图理解她的话。我还是我啊，他想，等她继续说下去，我并没有变成两个人。

"When you smile," Mitzuki went on finally, placing her hand flat on his chest and giving him a brief, closed-mouthed kiss, "I can see how happy you could be, and it makes me want to be the one that gets you to smile."  Gently, she embraced him, ignoring his partial nudity.  "And it makes me think, maybe, I could be happy too."  
"当你微笑时，" 光月终于继续说道，将手平放在他的胸前，给了他一个短暂的、闭嘴的吻，"我能看到你有多快乐，这让我想成为让你微笑的那个人。" 她温柔地拥抱了他，无视了他半裸的身体。"这让我觉得，也许，我也能感到快乐。"

Shinji stared over the young woman's shoulder, his eyes finding her bandana.  If only Asuka… he thought, no.  He shook his head, dismissing the thought, that's an illusion.  She's never going to be anything more than a friend – she doesn't WANT to be more than just a friend.  Time…time to let that go…  
真嗣盯着那位年轻女子的肩膀，目光落在了她的头带上。如果只是明日香……他想，不。他摇了摇头，摒弃了这个念头，那只是幻觉。她永远不会成为比朋友更多的存在——她并不想成为仅仅是朋友之外的任何角色。是时候……是时候放下这一切了……

Mitzuki felt her pulse quicken as the brown-haired boy turned his head and kissed her softly.  
光月感到自己的心跳加速，当那位棕色头发的男孩转过头来，温柔地吻了她。

"Can you give me a couple days?" he asked softly, looking into her bright green eyes as they parted, "I've got some stuff I've gotta work out."  He lowered his gaze, imagining that he could actually hear the illusion of a relationship with Asuka shattering in his mind, but still hoping, maybe…  "I don't want to rush into anything."  
“你能给我几天时间吗？”他轻声问道，目光与她明亮的绿色眼睛相遇，两人分开时，“我有些事情需要处理。”他垂下视线，想象着自己与明日香之间虚幻的关系在心中破碎的声音，但仍抱着一线希望，或许……“我不想仓促行事。”

The lavender-haired girl nodded quickly.  "Of course!" she said happily, "I don't want to rush into anything either, I…" she trailed off, blushing fiercely as her hand brushed the towel.  "Well," she said awkwardly, "I don't want to rush into anything, ummm… more."  Abruptly, she stepped back, "I'll let you get cleaned up now," she murmured, suddenly embarrassed by her brazen behavior.  
"紫罗兰色头发的女孩迅速点头。“当然！”她开心地说，“我也不想仓促行事，我……”她话音渐弱，脸颊因手触碰到毛巾而变得通红。“嗯，”她尴尬地说，“我不想仓促行事，呃……更多。”突然，她后退一步，“我现在让你去清洗吧，”她低声说，对自己的大胆行为突然感到尴尬。”

Shinji nodded, trying to keep himself covered as he headed towards the bathroom.  Not like she hasn't seen, he thought as he closed the door, but still.  He sighed as he cleaned himself up, refastening his pants and wrapping the hand towel in another towel before stuffing it into the hamper against the wall.   
"真嗣点头，尽量遮掩着自己走向浴室。虽然她已经见过，他想，但当他关上门时，依然如此。他叹了口气，清洗自己，重新系好裤子，将手巾裹在另一条毛巾里，然后塞进墙边的篮子里。”

When he emerged, Mitzuki smiled at him.  "Ummm… do you want to eat with me?" she asked timidly, balling her dampened shirt anxiously in her hands.  "You can say no, if you want."  
"当他出来时，光希对他微笑。“嗯……你想和我一起吃饭吗？”她怯生生地问，湿漉漉的衬衫在她手中紧张地揉成一团。“如果你不想，可以拒绝。””

He opened his mouth to say no, then closed it and nodded instead.  Might as well, he thought tiredly, no reason not to, right?  
他张嘴想说不要，随即又闭上，点了点头。反正也无所谓，他想疲惫地想，没有理由拒绝，对吧？

"Great!" the young woman beamed, "I'll cook something."  
“太好了！”年轻女子笑逐颜开，“我来做饭。”

Shinji reached out, restraining her by putting a hand on her shoulder.  "Can I help?" he asked quietly, smiling as she blushed and stammered that he was her guest, and shouldn't have to do any work.  "I like cooking."  
真嗣伸出手，轻轻按住她的肩膀阻止她。“我能帮忙吗？”他轻声问道，微笑着看她脸红结巴地说他是客人，不应该做任何事。“我喜欢做饭。”

Mitzuki closed her eyes, nodding slowly.  Could I want him any more? she thought as she turned and opened them, tossing her soiled shirt carelessly through the open bathroom door before leading him into the kitchen, No… no I don't think I could.  
Mitzuki 闭上眼睛，缓缓点头。我还能更想要他吗？她想着，转身睁开眼，将脏了的衬衫随意扔进敞开的浴室门，然后领他走进厨房，不……不，我想我不能再多了。

While they cooked a simple, traditional meal, she kept stealing glances at the boy, hoping that he wouldn't make her wait too long before deciding, because somehow, knowing if he wanted to be with her had somehow become very, very important to her.  
他们在做一顿简单传统的饭菜时，她不断偷瞄那个男孩，希望他不会让她等太久才做决定，因为不知为何，知道他是否想和她在一起变得对她非常重要。

**

"Why don't you call him, Devil?" Touji yawned.  "You've got his cell number."  
“为什么不给他打电话，Devil？”Touji 打了个哈欠。“你有他的手机号码。”

Asuka continued pacing (a pastime she enjoyed partaking of in front of him as often as possible) muttering, "No one asked you, moron.  I'm not going to pry."  
明日香继续在她喜欢的在他面前尽可能频繁地踱步，喃喃自语道：“没人问你，白痴。我才不会打探呢。”

"Uh huh," the boy replied, "but you will make me dizzy, wandering around the living room until the guy you 'hate' shows up.  Yeah, you're not prying, just-"  
“嗯哼，”男孩回答，“但你会在客厅里晃来晃去，直到你‘讨厌’的那个人出现，把我弄晕。是啊，你不是在打探，只是——”

"Will you shut up?"  
“你能闭嘴吗？”

Touji leaned back on the couch, putting his hands behind his head and closing his eyes.  "I'd say you should try decaf," he said, smiling slightly, "but you know what?  I already switched the cans when I heard you were moving in, so I know this is pure you."  
冬二靠在沙发上，双手枕在脑后，闭上了眼睛。“我该说你该试试低咖啡因的，”他微微一笑，“但你知道吗？我听说你要搬进来时，就已经把罐子换了，所以我知道这是纯正的你。”

Asuka finally stopped, plopping down in one of the chairs arranged around the large room.  "You're a real dick," she said levelly, "you know that?  If you're still wondering why Hikari doesn't want to sleep with you, I'll fill you in – it's because you're a pushy, know it all, asshole jerk who's so damn full of himself that he can't even say 'I love you,' when he knows that's probably all it would take to a get a proposal!"  
明日香终于停了下来，一屁股坐在大房间里的一张椅子上。“你真是个混蛋，”她平静地说，“知道吗？如果你还在纳闷为什么光不想和你上床，我来告诉你——就是因为你是个自以为是的混蛋，自大狂，自恋到连‘我爱你’都说不出口，而那可能就是让她答应求婚的全部了！”

Her nostrils flared as she waited for him to reply.  After a long moment, Touji stretched, rolling onto his side and facing the back of the couch.  "Yeah," he said quietly, "but of course – you wouldn't know anything about that, right…?"  
她鼻翼翕动，等待着他的回应。过了好一会儿，冬二伸了个懒腰，侧身转向沙发背。“是啊，”他轻声说，“当然——你对此一无所知，对吧…？”

"Don't pretend that you know me," the redhead whispered dangerously, her augmented hand unconsciously grasping the arm of the chair and leaving deep finger-marks in the wood, "I'm not like you, you loser!  I say what I mean, and I do-"  
"别装作你了解我，"红发女孩危险地低语，她那经过改造的手不自觉地抓住椅子的扶手，在木头上留下了深深的指痕，"我和你不一样，你这个失败者！我说到做到，而且我——"

"Shut up." "闭嘴。"

"What!?" "什么！？"

"You heard me," the former Fourth Child murmured, still facing away from her, "you're so full of shit it makes me sick to be in the same room with you.  You think everyone buys your little 'fuck the world' line?  I've got news for you, Red – that shit may fly with people that don't know you, but I went to school with you, I fought with you, and I live with you… and the only person you're fooling is yourself."  
"你听到了，"曾经的第四适格者低声说道，依然背对着她，"你满嘴胡言乱语，让我和你待在同一个房间都感到恶心。你以为大家都相信你那套‘去他妈的世界’的说辞吗？我有个消息告诉你，红发——那些鬼话或许能骗过不了解你的人，但我跟你上过同一所学校，和你并肩作战过，还和你住在一起……你唯一能骗到的只有你自己。"

Asuka glared at the boy's back.  "You don't know shit, Suzuhara, and you didn't fight with me, you got crushed – like the bug that you are!"  She took a deep breath, knowing her composure was long gone, and hating the feeling.  "I don't need anyone!  Least of all a sniveling, kiss-ass, fucking _loser_ like Shinji!"  
明日香瞪着男孩的背影。"你什么都不知道，铃原，你不是和我并肩作战，你是被碾压了——就像你这只小虫子一样！"她深吸一口气，知道自己早已失去了冷静，痛恨这种感觉。"我不需要任何人！尤其是像真嗣那样卑躬屈膝、讨好卖乖的废物！"

For a moment, Touji said nothing.  Finally, he sat up, turning to face her.  "You know something, Souryu?" he said tiredly, shaking his head, "You and him, just…" he trailed off, his eyes widening.  
"一时间，冬二什么也没说。最后，他坐起身，转向面对她。“你知道吗，剑介？”他疲惫地说，摇着头，“你和他，就是……”他话没说完，眼睛却睁大了。”

"Just what!?" the redhead snapped.  When he didn't answer, she turned to see what he was staring at.  
“就是什么！？”红发女孩厉声问道。见他没有回答，她转头去看他在盯着什么。”

Shinji stood in the doorway, his hand still on the knob and his key still dangling from it.  His other hand was clenched into an irregular fist, clutching whatever he was holding in it to the point that his knuckles were white, and he was chewing his bottom lip absently, staring off into space with a disturbingly blank look on his face.  
“真嗣站在门口，手还放在门把手上，钥匙依然挂在上面。另一只手紧握成一个不规则的拳头，紧抓着他手中所持之物，以至于指节都发白了，他心不在焉地咬着下唇，眼神空洞地凝视着远方，脸上带着令人不安的空白表情。”

Fuck!  Touji and Asuka thought at the exact same time.  They rose to their feet, first Asuka, then Touji, and faced him, neither quite willing to take the first step and speak.  Before they could, Shinji nodded slowly to himself and stepped back out the door.  
操！ 东治和明日香在同一时间想到。 他们站起身来，先是明日香，然后是东治，面对着他，两人都不太愿意迈出第一步开口。 在他们能开口之前，真嗣缓缓地点了点头，退出门外。

As it clicked shut, Touji sat back on the couch, shaking his head.  
随着门咔嗒一声关上，东治又坐回到沙发上，摇着头。

"Don't you dare," Asuka muttered as the boy opened his mouth, "not one fucking word, do you hear me?  If you even so much as start a syllable, I'll fucking crush your other leg."  
“你敢，”明日香低声说道，当男孩张开嘴时，“一个该死的字都别说，你听到了吗？ 如果你敢说出一个音节，我会把你另一条腿也打断。”

Touji shrugged, leaning back on the couch and closing his eyes.  Go after him! he thought, biting his tongue so hard he thought it would bleed, Don't let him walk out like that!  GO GET HIM YOU STUPID WOMAN!  
真嗣耸了耸肩，靠在沙发上闭上了眼睛。追上去啊！他心里想着，咬紧了舌头，痛得几乎要出血，别让他就这样走掉！去追他啊，你这个笨女人！

The redhead took a hesitant step towards the door, her face a study in uncertainty and pain… then abruptly changed directions and headed towards her room.  
红发女孩犹豫地向门口迈了一步，脸上满是不确定和痛苦……然后突然改变了方向，朝自己的房间走去。

As he heard her footsteps retreating deeper into the house, Touji considered chasing Shinji himself, but he knew nothing he could say would make his friend feel better.  It had to come from Asuka, and he seriously doubted the girl would try to make any kind of apology or explanation.  In his mind, only one word described the redhead at that moment, and he whispered it to himself, trying to figure out how he could help mend what she had broken.  
当听到她的脚步声越来越远，深入屋内时，真嗣考虑过自己去追绫波，但他知道无论说什么都无法让朋友感觉好些。这必须来自明日香，而他严重怀疑她会尝试做出任何形式的道歉或解释。在他心中，此刻的红发女孩只有一个词可以形容，他轻声对自己说，试图想出如何帮助修复她所破坏的一切。

"Idiot." "白痴。"

**

A week passed, during which Shinji and Asuka spent much of their time avoiding one another, annoying Touji to no end and raising the tension level in the house to a nearly unbearable point.  
一周过去了，期间真嗣和明日香大部分时间都在互相回避，这让冬二烦不胜烦，家里的紧张气氛几乎到了难以忍受的地步。

Shinji went out with Mitzuki twice more, relaxing considerably as she asked nothing more from him than a simple kiss goodnight… but he could still sense her anxiety.  He knew that she was waiting for a definite reply, and the more he put her off, the worse he felt about it.  
真嗣又和光约会了两次，随着她只要求一个简单的晚安吻，他放松了不少……但他仍能感觉到她的焦虑。他知道她在等待一个明确的答复，而他越是拖延，就越感到内疚。

Touji was no help to him, either, as it seemed that the boy had taken a sudden interest in locking his door and sleeping whenever Shinji happened to be home.  
真嗣发现，阿薰对他也毫无帮助，因为那男孩似乎突然对锁门睡觉产生了兴趣，每当真嗣在家时，他总是如此。

Several times, Shinji found himself standing in front of Asuka's door, his hand raised to knock, but he could never quite bring himself to do it.  The object in his pocket seemed to grow heavier with every passing day, making him wonder if perhaps it was less a simple trinket he could not bring himself to give and more an intangible icon of his feelings.  
有好几次，真嗣发现自己站在明日香的门前，手举起来准备敲门，却始终无法鼓起勇气。口袋里的那个物品似乎随着时间的推移变得越来越沉重，让他不禁怀疑，这究竟是一个他无法送出的简单小饰品，还是他情感的无形象征。

This idea concerned him, for if it was true – what did it mean if he could not give it?  
这个想法让他感到困扰，因为如果这是真的——如果他无法送出它，这意味着什么呢？

It was a Friday night when he was finally forced to make a choice.  
那是一个周五的夜晚，他最终被迫做出了选择。

"That one wasn't so bad," Mitzuki was saying, smiling as she brought Shinji's hand up and kissed it.  "Was it?"  
“那个还不算太糟，”Mitzuki 说道，微笑着将真嗣的手抬起并吻了一下。“是吧？”

Shinji shook his head, looking ahead as Mitzuki's house came into view.  "Definitely not as scary as Shadow's," he conceded.  "But next time, can we see a drama or something?"  
真嗣摇了摇头，目光直视前方，Mitzuki 的家映入眼帘。“绝对没有 Shadow 那么吓人，”他承认道。“不过下次，我们能看个剧什么的吗？”

"Sure," Mitzuki said warmly, leaning her head on his shoulder as they walked.  
“当然，”光月温柔地说道，将头靠在他的肩上，两人一同走着。

Silence stole over them as they neared her building, and as they came to a halt, Shinji murmured, "Well… guess this is goodnight."  
当他们走近她的住处时，四周陷入了沉默，停下脚步时，真嗣低声说道：“嗯……看来今晚就到这里了。”

Mitzuki leaned up, tilting her head expectantly until Shinji leaned forward and kissed her.  As he stepped back, she reached out and grasped his hand.  
光月微微抬起头，期待地歪着脑袋，直到真嗣俯身亲吻了她。他后退一步，她便伸出手握住了他的手。

"Don't go." "别走。"

Shinji blushed.  "Mitzuki, I…"  
真嗣脸红了。  “光希，我……”

The waitress smiled gently as he trailed off, waiting until he met her gaze before whispering, "I think… I figured out what the problem is – with you and me, I mean."  
女服务员温柔地微笑着，等他停下后，直到他迎上她的目光，才轻声说道：“我想……我明白了我们之间的问题所在。”

"What problem?" Shinji asked halfheartedly, not truly wanting to hear.  
"什么问题？" 真嗣半心半意地问道，其实并不真正想听。

Mitzuki laced her right hand with his left.  "You, umm… not wanting to be with me," she said quietly.  
光月用她的右手握住他的左手。 "你，嗯……不想和我在一起，" 她轻声说道。

"Oh?" Shinji replied, forcing his tone to remain noncommittal.  
"哦？" 真嗣回答，努力让自己的语气保持中立。

"Well, I kinda realized that it's one of those 'all or nothing' kinda things," Mitzuki said, nervously shifting from one foot to the other, "ya know what I mean?  Like, maybe you're just thinking about it too much."  
"嗯，我有点意识到这是那种'要么全有要么全无'的事情，" 光希说，紧张地从一只脚换到另一只脚，"你懂我的意思吧？就像，也许你只是想得太多了。"

"I don't follow," Shinji murmured, though in all honesty, he did.  
"我不明白，" 真嗣低声说，尽管说实话，他确实懂。

"What I'm saying," the girl pressed, unwilling to let it go, "is that… maybe you should just stop thinking for a little while – see what happens.  Because if you do that, maybe I can prove that I'm worth it.  Make more sense now?"  
"我要说的是，" 女孩坚持道，不愿就此罢休，"就是……也许你应该暂时停止思考——看看会发生什么。因为如果你这么做，也许我就能证明我是值得的。现在明白了吗？"

Shinji averted his eyes, nodding slowly.  
真嗣移开了视线，缓缓点头。

"So what I was thinking," the girl said hesitantly, "what I was… wondering, is if you wanted to…" she lowered her eyes, flushing as she whispered, "stay the night."  
“我刚才在想，”女孩犹豫地说，“我在……想，你是不是愿意……”她垂下眼帘，脸颊泛红，低声说道，“留下来过夜。”

Shinji's hand clenched in his pocket, the hard edges of the object perpetually kept there digging into his palm.  "If I do," he replied softly, pushing his sadness away as his hand slowly uncurled, "would you let me cook breakfast…?"  
真嗣口袋里的手紧握着，那件一直放在那里的硬物边缘刺痛了他的手掌。“如果我留下，”他轻声回答，努力驱散心中的悲伤，手慢慢松开，“你愿意让我做早餐吗……？”

Mitzuki nodded slowly, sensing that this simple request meant a lot more than she could see.  "Of course."  
Mitzuki 缓缓点头，感觉到这个简单的请求背后隐藏着比她所能看到的更多含义。“当然。”

"And," the brown-haired boy added quietly, "will you take off your bandana?"  
“还有，”棕发男孩轻声补充道，“你会摘下你的头巾吗？”

"As soon as we get insi-"  
“一进到里面就-”

"Now." "现在。"

The waitress froze, totally unprepared for his odd demand.  Is this some kind of test? she thought, licking her lips nervously and looking around the quiet street, It's late, and there aren't that many people around…  
女服务员愣住了，完全没料到他这古怪的要求。这是某种考验吗？她紧张地舔了舔嘴唇，环顾着寂静的街道，心想，天色已晚，周围也没多少人……

Shinji watched as she slowly reached up and removed the cloth from her head, allowing the harsh illumination from the streetlights to shine off her purple hair. "Thank you," he said, smiling softly.  
真嗣看着她缓缓伸手摘下头上的布巾，让街灯的强烈光线照在她紫色的头发上。“谢谢，”他轻声说道，脸上露出温柔的微笑。

"Ummm," Mitzuki hummed, smiling weakly and trying not to look around to see how many people were staring at her, "does that mean you'll stay…?"  
"嗯……" 光希哼了一声，虚弱地笑了笑，尽量不四处张望看有多少人在盯着她，"那是不是意味着你会留下来……？"

The former Third Child squeezed the small item one final time, then brought his hand out of his pocket, reaching out to gently caress her face.  He could feel the young woman's breath escape in a gentle sigh against his palm as he whispered his reply.  
前第三适格者最后一次捏了捏那个小物件，然后从口袋里抽出手，伸出去轻轻抚摸她的脸颊。他能感觉到年轻女子在他掌心下轻轻叹息，仿佛在回应他的低语。

To be concluded… 未完待续……

Author's notes:  what was Shinji's reply?  Oh yeah, right – like I'm gonna tell before the next chapter!  Whatever!!  About Sachiko's sudden lack of interest in Shinji… well, things happen that way sometimes. *shrug* I've had it happen to myself, once or twice – one day you only want that person, the next… you could take them or leave them.  Can't relate?  Can't help ya.  :P  But I hope you're liking the story so far!  
作者的话：  Shinji 的回答是什么？哦，对了——就像我会在下一章之前告诉你一样！随便啦！！关于 Sachiko 突然对 Shinji 失去兴趣的事……嗯，有时候事情就是这样发生的。*耸肩*我自己也经历过一两次——有一天你只想要那个人，第二天……你可以接受他们，也可以离开他们。无法理解？帮不了你。:P 但我希望到目前为止你喜欢这个故事！

Pre-read was done by the Asuka/Shinji fangirl club president – Ryoma!! Thanks, little miss!!  Hehehe  Also lending a hand was Daniel.  Thanks going out to him as well as yon metal god LeperMessiah, who's most valuable input was, "Shit, I'd do Mitzuki!"  Yeah man… me too.  O_o  
预读由 Asuka/Shinji 同人女俱乐部主席——Ryoma 完成！！谢谢，小小姐！！呵呵呵 还有 Daniel 也伸出援手。感谢他以及那位金属之神 LeperMessiah，他最有价值的意见是，“该死，我想对 Mitzuki 下手！”是啊，伙计……我也是。O_o

Also, for some reason I cannot fathom… fanfiction.net seems to be stripping all of my italics. -_-  Every thought SHOULD be italicized, but they're all just plain words *sigh* and I don't know why.  So sorry about that.  
另外，出于某种我无法理解的原因……fanfiction.net 似乎在剥离我所有的斜体。-_- 每个想法本应是斜体的，但它们都只是普通文字*叹气*，我不知道为什么。对此感到抱歉。

### Side 3 The Unstable Triangle Formula

"I'm home." “我回来了。”

Asuka glanced up from the novel she was reading as Shinji came into the kitchen.  "Welcome home," she muttered, "Your stooge friend's around somewhe-"  
真嗣走进厨房时，明日香从正在阅读的小说中抬起头来。“欢迎回家，”她咕哝道，“你的跟班朋友在某个地方——”

Shinji frowned as she cut herself off, staring at him as if he was some type of horribly deformed mutant and she was trying to deicide on the best way to kill him.  "What?  What is it?"  
真嗣皱起眉头，她突然停下话头，盯着他，仿佛他是个严重畸形的变种人，而她在考虑用什么方法杀掉他。“什么？怎么了？”

"What happened to you?" she asked softly, pointing to the young man's neck with a grimace of distaste.  "God, Shinji… what did you let her do to you?!"  
“你这是怎么了？”她轻声问道，指着年轻人的脖子，露出厌恶的表情。“天哪，真嗣……你让她对你做了什么？！”

"Why do you care?" Shinji asked defensively, trying to pull the collar of his shirt up to hide the series of bite marks that lined his throat.  
“你为什么在乎？”真嗣防备地问道，试图拉高衬衫领子，遮住脖子上的一串咬痕。

"I don't," Asuka replied automatically, "I just wish you'd have some fucking self-respect!  Spending all night at that bitch's house, skipping work, coming home in the same clothes you left in, walking around with your neck covered in hickies – you're acting like a slut!"  
"我没有，" 明日香不假思索地回答，"我只是希望你能有点该死的自尊！整晚待在那婊子的家里，翘班，穿着出门时的衣服回家，脖子上满是吻痕到处走——你简直像个荡妇！"

Shinji blinked.  "A what?"  
真嗣眨了眨眼。"什么？"

"You heard me," Asuka muttered, her augmented hand twitching slightly, "slut."  When Shinji made no reply, Asuka sneered.  "I'm giving you too much credit – you wouldn't have the balls to make a decent slut, because sluts go after what they want!"  She clenched her hands into fists as he turned away.  "Look at me, damn you!"  
"你听到了，" 明日香低声说，她的强化手微微抽搐，"荡妇。" 见真嗣没有回应，明日香冷笑道。"我对你期望太高了——你连做个像样的荡妇的胆量都没有，因为荡妇会去追求她们想要的！" 她握紧拳头，当他转身离开时。"看着我，该死的！"

Shinji flinched, keeping his eyes averted as he whispered something too low for Asuka to hear.  
真嗣畏缩了一下，目光避开，低声说了些什么，声音太低，明日香听不见。

"What was that?" she snapped.  
“那是什么？”她厉声问道。

"Why can't you just be nice to me…?" Shinji repeated softly.  "I… I thought we were friends.  We've been friends for so lo-"  
“为什么你不能对我好一点…？”真嗣轻声重复道。“我…我以为我们是朋友。我们已经做了这么久的朋友…”

"We're not friends!" Asuka cut in angrily.  "You're not the person I thought you were, Third Child, you're just a pathetic, weak-willed little boy who's so damn caught up in his own little fuck fantasies that he can't see that other people ne-" she cut herself off, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath.  
"我们不是朋友！" 明日香愤怒地打断道。 "你不是我以为的那个人，第三适格者，你只是一个可悲的、意志薄弱的小男孩，完全沉浸在自己的那些该死的性幻想中，看不到别人——" 她突然停住，闭上眼睛，深吸了一口气。

Shinji said nothing for a moment, finally bringing his eyes up to meet hers.  "And what about you?" he whispered, his voice low and shaking with anger.  "What do you see in the mirror, Asuka?  Are you the person you wanted to be when we were lying on that beach?"  
真嗣沉默了一会儿，终于抬起眼睛与她对视。 "那你呢？" 他低声问道，声音因愤怒而颤抖。 "你在镜子里看到了什么，明日香？ 当我们躺在那片海滩上时，你是你想成为的那个人吗？"

"I don't believe I'm hearing this," Asuka hissed, "how dare you question me, you little shit!"  She reached out, poking him in the chest with her forefinger.  "I came back because I wanted to live.  Not for you, not for EVA, not for anyone else but me – I came back to live, goddamn it!"  
"我不敢相信我会听到这些，" 明日香咬牙切齿地说，"你怎么敢质疑我，你这个小混蛋！" 她伸出手，用食指戳了戳他的胸口。 "我回来是因为我想活下去。不是为了你，不是为了 EVA，也不是为了任何人，而是为了我自己——我回来是为了活下去，该死的！"

Shinji stared at her unblinkingly.  "You didn't answer my question."  
真嗣目不转睛地盯着她。 \"你没回答我的问题。\"

"Fuck your question!" Asuka snapped.  "Why don't you ask yourself, huh?  When it was just you and me, and no one else had come back yet, and you promised me you'd always be there for me… were you already planning to start fucking anything that moved?"  
"去你的问题！" 明日香厉声道。 "你怎么不问问自己，嗯？ 当只有你和我，其他人还没回来，你答应过我会一直陪着我……你是不是已经在计划开始对任何会动的东西下手了？\"

"At least I can let others near me," Shinji retorted, "and it's not like this is what I wanted, you know, I wanted-"  
"至少我能让别人靠近我，" 真嗣反驳道， "而且这又不是我想要的，你知道，我想要的是……\"

Asuka's eyes narrowed as Shinji abruptly stopped talking and turned away once more.  "What?" she whispered coldly.  "What did you want, Shinji?"  When he kept his eyes averted, she pounded her fist on the table, making the salt shaker jump.  "Why can't you fucking look at me?!?  Damn it!  Tell me what you want, Shinji!  How the hell am I supposed to know how- you know what?  Forget it.  Just… just forget it."  She turned her back on him.  "Get out of my sight, Shinji.  You make me sick."  
明日香的眼神变得锐利，因为真嗣突然停止了说话，再次转过身去。“什么？”她冷冷地低声问道。“你想要什么，真嗣？”当他继续避开目光时，她一拳砸在桌子上，让盐瓶都跳了起来。“你他妈的为什么不敢看我？！该死！告诉我你想要什么，真嗣！我他妈怎么可能知道——你知道吗？算了。就……就当没这回事。”她背对着他。“滚出我的视线，真嗣。你让我恶心。”

"Why is it my fault?"  
“为什么是我的错？”

She blinked, turning back to him.  "What was that?" she whispered incredulously.  
她眨了眨眼，转回身面对他。“你说什么？”她难以置信地低声问道。

Shinji's eyes were on the floor, but his brow was drawn down in an unmistakable frown.  "Why is it my fault?" he repeated, a hint of anger in his voice.  "How am I supposed to know what to do if no one tells me?  I'm doing the best I can… but you have to be part of it too – no matter what you say, we're supposed to be friends.  I can't do this alone."  
真嗣的目光落在地板上，但眉头紧锁，显而易见地皱着。“为什么这是我的错？”他重复道，声音中带着一丝愤怒。“如果没人告诉我该怎么做，我怎么可能知道？我已经在尽我所能了……但你也必须参与进来——不管你说什么，我们应该是朋友。我不能独自完成这一切。”

Asuka flushed.  "Why don't you ask your little slut girlfriend for help then?"  
明日香脸红了。“那你为什么不找你的小婊子女朋友帮忙呢？”

Shinji's nostrils flared.  "Just because she treats me nice doesn't mean she's a slut," he whispered flatly, "if you were half as nice as she is, maybe we-"  
真嗣的鼻孔微微张开。“仅仅因为她对我好并不意味着她是个婊子，”他平静地低声说道，“如果你有她一半的好，也许我们——”

The crack of Asuka's augmented hand hitting Shinji's cheek was loud and ringing, nearly sending him to the floor with its force.  
明日香那经过改造的手掌击打在真嗣脸颊上的声音响亮而回荡，几乎要将他击倒在地。

"Don't you ever compare me to her!" Asuka hissed.  "Ever."  
“你永远不要把我跟她相提并论！”明日香低声咆哮。“永远不要。”

Shinji blinked, his eyes watering more from the pain in his chest than the pain in his cheek.  "I wouldn't try," he said as calmly as he could, "I've got nothing to compare her kindness to."  
真嗣眨了眨眼，泪水更多是因为胸口的痛楚而非脸颊的疼痛。“我不会尝试，”他尽可能平静地说，“我没有她的善良可以比较。”

Asuka flinched, but could not think of a suitable reply.  
明日香退缩了，却想不出合适的回答。

Why does it have to be this way? She thought suddenly, We should be friends.  We should be MORE than friends, damn it!  That's what I want!  I Just… I just want to be close to him – and now I can't. She averted her eyes, caught somewhere between rage and despair.  Damn it, Shinji – why couldn't you just wait for like, another week?  I was so close!  …so close.  
为什么非得这样？她突然想到，我们应该成为朋友。我们应该不仅仅是朋友，该死！那才是我想要的！我只是……我只是想靠近他——现在却做不到了。她移开视线，陷入了愤怒与绝望的交织之中。该死的，真嗣——你为什么就不能再等一个星期呢？我差点就成功了！……就差那么一点。

"I'm gonna take a shower," Shinji said unevenly, rubbing his cheek with a look of dazed hurt, "I've gotta work in the morning."  He lowered his voice to a bare whisper.  "At least I know there's someone there that cares about me."  
“我去洗个澡，”真嗣不稳地说道，揉着脸颊，神情恍惚而受伤，“明天早上还得工作。”他压低声音，几乎成了耳语。“至少我知道有人在乎我。”

Asuka clenched her eyes closed and nodded, more to her self than him.  And when she spoke, she was not quite sure who she was talking to.  
明日香紧闭双眼，点了点头，与其说是对他，不如说是对自己。而当她开口时，她不太确定自己在对谁说话。

"Goddamn coward." “该死的懦夫。”

Shinji did not even hesitate at the redhead's whisper, choosing instead to simply walk unsteadily towards his room and barely noticing as he bumped into Touji on the way down the hall.  
真嗣对红发少女的低语毫不犹豫，反而选择摇摇晃晃地走向自己的房间，在走廊上撞到东治时几乎没注意到。

Touji frowned, nodding a greeting as the former Third Child trudged up the stairs.  "Ok," he muttered angrily, "that's it."  
冬二皱起眉头，向前任第三适格者点了点头算是打招呼，对方拖着沉重的步伐走上楼梯。“好吧，”他愤怒地喃喃自语，“就这样了。”

Asuka looked up as the door to the kitchen banged open.  "What do you want?" she growled, trying not to shrink away from the scowling visage of an obviously enraged, physically superior Touji Suzuhara.  "You get away from me!" she warned, raising her fists and bracing herself in case he decided to attack her.  
明日香抬头望向砰然打开的厨房门。“你想要什么？”她咆哮道，试图不让自己在明显愤怒、体格占优的铃原东治那怒目而视的面孔前退缩。“离我远点！”她警告道，举起拳头，准备在他决定攻击时自卫。

He's lost it, she thought grimly, look at that face!  He's out of his mind.  
他失控了，她阴沉地想，看看那张脸！他疯了。

For one, shining instant, Touji considered just walking away.  Don't get it started man, he thought grimly, it won't end good.  Just let it go.  This is between her and Shinji… just let it go.  
有那么一瞬间，光辉闪耀，阿斯兰考虑就这么走开。别让它开始，伙计，他想阴沉地想，这不会有什么好结果。就让它过去吧。这是她和真嗣之间的事……就让它过去吧。

He actually took a step back before catching himself. For weeks he had watched the redhead emotionally crucify his best friend, keeping himself from doing anything that he might later regret through sheer willpower and a grudging respect for all the girl had endured… but looking into her cold, sparkling, unremorseful sky-blue eye, he realized that the time to just let things go had long since passed.  Now it was time to take matters into his own hands.  
他实际上退了一步，然后才回过神来。几周以来，他看着那个红发女孩用情感折磨他最好的朋友，凭借纯粹的意志力和对这个女孩所承受的一切的不情愿的尊重，克制自己不做任何可能后悔的事情……但当他对上她那冷漠、闪烁、毫无悔意的湛蓝眼睛时，他意识到，放手不管的时刻早已过去。现在是他自己动手的时候了。

"Who the fuck do you think you are?!"  
“你他妈以为你是谁？！”

Eight, coldly spoken words… and the storm that had been threatening for almost a month exploded in the kitchen.  
八个冷冰冰的字……厨房里那场酝酿了近一个月的风暴终于爆发了。

"Don't you dare get sanctimonious on me, you fucking gimp!" Asuka snapped, positioning herself on the other side of the table, "Why don't you butt out for once, or do I have to hurt you first?"  
"你敢在我面前装圣人，你这个该死的瘸子！" 明日香厉声喝道，站到了桌子的另一边，"你能不能别插手一次，还是我得先把你打趴下？"

"You keep saying that," Touji said flatly, pushing the kitchen door closed behind him and engaging the lock, "you ever gonna back it up?  Or are you all talk?"  
"你总是这么说，" 冬二平淡地回应，随手关上厨房门并上了锁，"你真的会动手吗？还是只是说说而已？"

"Come over here and find out," Asuka challenged, shoving one of the chairs against the wall to make more room.  
"过来这里，自己看看，" 明日香挑衅道，将一把椅子推到墙边，腾出更多空间。

Touji grinned, cracking his knuckles loudly.  "All you had to do was ask," he said, keeping the same, cruel smile on his lips as he started towards her, "I've been keeping my cool," he muttered, picking the other kitchen chair up and tossing it aside like a bundle of sticks, ignoring the sound it made as it crashed to the floor.  "I kept telling myself, 'She's been through a lot.  She's just mixed up.  She doesn't know what she's saying,' but that's all bullshit – you knew perfectly well how bad he wanted to be yours, and you still treat him like shit every fucking chance you get."  
真嗣咧嘴一笑，大声地活动着手指关节。"你只要开口问就行了，"他保持着那副残忍的笑容向她走去，"我一直很冷静，"他低声说着，拿起另一把厨房椅子，像扔一捆柴火一样扔到一旁，无视它砸到地板上的声音。"我一直告诉自己，'她经历了很多。她只是搞混了。她不知道自己在说什么，'但这些都是屁话——你明明清楚他有多想成为你的，而你每次有机会还是把他当垃圾对待。"

"Stay away from me," Asuka whispered, her knuckles going white as her fingernails dug into her palms, "I won't go easy on you – do you hear me?!"  
"离我远点，" 明日香低声说，她的指关节因用力而发白，指甲深深陷入掌心，"我不会对你手下留情的——你听到了吗？！"

Touji, it seemed, did not seem to mind the prospect of being harmed by the redhead.  Pushing the table aside, he rushed her, shrugging her quickly thrown punches off as if they were no more bothersome than insects and grasping her by the wrist, twisting her arm up behind her back and shoving her face-first into the wall next to the stove.  
似乎，真治并不介意被红发女孩伤害的可能性。他推开桌子，冲向她，轻松地甩开她迅速挥出的拳头，仿佛那些不过是烦人的小虫子，然后抓住她的手腕，将她的手臂扭到背后，把她脸朝下按在炉子旁边的墙上。

A servo in Asuka's arm whined as the boy applied more pressure, forcing it further back until she cried out.  "S-stop!"  
随着男孩加大压力，明日香手臂中的伺服电机发出哀鸣，迫使它进一步向后弯曲，直到她痛呼出声。"停下！"

"Thought you were going to hurt me," Touji whispered, reaching past her and grasping the handle of the biggest butcher knife in the block, "you're full of shit, Souryu."  
“以为你会伤害我，”真治低声说道，从她身边伸出手，抓住刀架上最大的切肉刀的把手，“你满嘴胡言，惣流。”

Asuka fought harder as the boy drew the knife in one fluid move, bringing it up under her chin and pressing it against her throat.  "You're… crazy," she gasped, flinching as the sharp steel pressed against her delicate skin.  
随着男孩流畅地抽出刀，刀尖抵在她的下巴下并紧贴着她的喉咙，明日香挣扎得更厉害了。“你……疯了，”她喘息着，当锋利的刀刃压在她娇嫩的皮肤上时，她不禁缩了一下。

"Better stop struggling," Touji said softly, "I wouldn't want to slip."  He nodded as the girl froze.  "Now you listen to me, you little bitch, Shinji's been moping around here for weeks, pining over your sorry ass, and all you can do is treat him like shit!  And for what?" he hissed, itching to draw the blade across her throat, "Because he's with someone else now?  He's only dating her because you're so fucking coldhearted!  If you had ever given him a chance, you'd be with him right now, you dipshit."  
“最好别再挣扎了，”冬二轻声说，“我不想失手。”他点头示意女孩僵住。“现在你听好了，你这个小婊子，真嗣在这里已经闷闷不乐好几个星期了，对你念念不忘，而你却只会对他恶言相向！为什么？”他低声咆哮，忍不住想在她的喉咙上划一刀，“因为他现在和别人在一起了？他只是因为你的冷酷无情才和别人约会的！如果你曾经给他机会，你现在就会和他在一起了，你这个蠢货。”

"Who'd want to?" Asuka managed, swallowing several times to clear the dryness from her mouth.  "He's just a wea-"  
“谁会想要？”明日香勉强说道，吞咽了几次以缓解喉咙的干燥。“他只不过是个懦——”

"Don't you dare," Touji snarled, pulling the knife away from her throat to keep himself from killing her.  "I'm sick of hearing that shit!  He saved the fucking world – don't you ever say he's weak!"  
"你敢试试看，" 冬二咆哮道，将刀从她喉咙旁拉开，以免自己真的杀了她。"我听腻了那些屁话！他拯救了这个世界——你永远别说他软弱！"

Asuka closed her eye, shifting on her feet and analyzing the balance between them, a grim smile spreading on her features as she found the opening she was looking for.  "You know something, shithead?" she muttered, tilting her body subtly to the side.  
明日香闭上眼睛，调整着站立的姿势，分析着彼此间的平衡，当她找到想要的破绽时，脸上露出了冷酷的微笑。"你知道吗，混蛋？"她低声说道，身体微妙地向一侧倾斜。

"What, bitch?" "什么，婊子？"

Asuka grinned wolfishly. "You just fucked up big."  
明日香狞笑着。“你这下可闯大祸了。”

"Wha-" "什-"

Grunting from the pain it caused, Asuka rolled her shoulder further up, making Touji lose his grip on her wrist.  They scuffled, each trying to gain the upper hand as they knocked into the furniture, sending dishes, silverware, and boxes and cans of food flying in every direction.  All told, the struggle for dominance lasted fifteen seconds, but by the time they were done, the kitchen looked as if a war had erupted in it, throwing it into a state of chaos unlike any seen before.  
明日香因疼痛而闷哼一声，肩膀猛地一抬，让东治失去了对她的手腕的控制。两人扭打在一起，试图占据上风，撞翻了家具，餐具、银器、以及各种食品罐头和盒子四处飞散。总的来说，这场争夺主导权的战斗持续了十五秒，但当他们结束时，厨房看起来就像刚刚经历了一场战争，陷入了一种前所未有的混乱状态。

Silence prevailed for another fifteen seconds, broken only by uneven, but quietly drawn pants as the two teens struggled to regain their breath.  
又是一阵长达十五秒的寂静，只被两个青少年不均匀但低沉的喘息声打破，他们正努力恢复呼吸。

"Give me one good reason not to fucking kill you," Asuka whispered finally, the fingers of her augmented hand digging cruelly into Touji's throat as she pushed him against the wall with just enough force to make him wince.  
"给我一个不杀了你的好理由，" 明日香终于低声说道，她那经过改造的手指残忍地掐进真嗣的喉咙，将他推到墙上，力度刚好让他皱眉。

"I'll give you two," Touji gasped, baring his teeth at her in a wicked smile.  "First, Hikari would fuck you up – trust me: under that cool surface, she's got a short fuse.  And second," his smile grew, "if you squeeze, I push."  
"我给你两个，" 真嗣喘着气，对她露出一个邪恶的笑容。"首先，光会把你揍扁——相信我：在她冷静的外表下，脾气可不太好。其次，" 他的笑容扩大了，"如果你用力，我就刺下去。"

Asuka frowned, glancing down as something sharp nudged her breastbone and finding the tip of the knife situated snuggly between her breasts, braced in both of the young man's hands – ready to plunge into her heart at a moment's notice.  
明日香皱眉，低头看向有什么尖锐的东西抵在了她的胸骨上，发现是一把刀的尖端紧贴在她双乳之间，被年轻人双手稳稳地握着——随时准备刺入她的心脏。

"Stalemate." "僵局。"

Asuka's lips pulled back from her teeth.  "Not quite," she growled, "if I snap your neck, you'll be dead before you hit the floor."  
明日香的嘴唇从牙齿上拉开。  “不见得，”她咆哮道，“如果我扭断你的脖子，你还没落地就已经死了。”

Touji narrowed his eyes, coaxing the knife forward and taking great pleasure in watching the girl's smile falter.  "You wanna find out?"  
冬二眯起眼睛，将刀子向前推，看着女孩的笑容动摇，感到极大的快意。  “你想试试吗？”

Their eyes met, neither willing to look away as each tried to stare the other down.  "Listen to me, stooge," Asuka whispered coldly, "what's between Shinji and me is just that – between Shinji and me.  Don't get in my way again, or next time this happens you won't have time to reach the knives, get it?"  
他们的目光相遇，谁也不愿先移开视线，彼此试图用眼神压倒对方。“听我说，蠢货，”明日香冷冷地低语，“我和真嗣之间的事，只是我们之间的事。别再挡我的路，否则下次你就没时间去拿刀了，明白吗？”

"Same goes for you," Touji whispered dangerously, "the next time you hurt him, you won't have to worry about getting your arm tuned."  
“你也一样，”冬二危险地低声说道，“下次你再伤害他，就不用担心调整手臂了。”

Asuka's body was shaking with rage.  "Fucking asshole," she snarled, "I don't need this shit from you, him, or anyone else."  With one quick move, she released his throat, bringing her hand down on the knife and knocking it from the young man's grasp, ignoring the sound of tearing fabric as the blade rent her shirt apart.  "I'm sick of you," she hissed, taking a step back and clenching her hands into fists at her sides, "I'm sick of you, him, his little fucking slut girlfriend, this house – I'm sick of all this shit!  Fuck all of you!!"  
明日香的身体因愤怒而颤抖。“该死的混蛋，”她咆哮道，“我不需要你、他或任何人的这种烂事。”她迅速一挥手，松开了他的喉咙，用手掌击落了年轻人手中的刀，无视刀刃撕裂衬衫的声音。“我受够了你，”她低声怒吼，后退一步，双手紧握成拳，“我受够了你、他、他那小婊子女友、这房子——我受够了这一切烂事！去你的！！”

Touji shook his head as the former Second Child whirled around and stomped off, tearing the door open and splintering the frame in her urgency to retreat.  "Fuck us?" he muttered to the empty room.  "Hey, fuck you, you little holier than thou bitch!  Shit, I never wanted you here anyway."  
冬二摇了摇头，看着前二号机驾驶员猛地转身，跺着脚离开，急切地拉开房门，连门框都给扯裂了。“操我们？”他对着空荡荡的房间低声咒骂，“嘿，去你的，你这个自以为是的婊子！妈的，反正我从来就没想让你在这儿。”

Gingerly touching his throat, he glanced around the decimated kitchen.  
他小心翼翼地摸了摸自己的喉咙，环顾着被毁得面目全非的厨房。

"Shinji's gonna be pissed," he mused, wondering if the other young man had heard their fight.  
“真嗣会生气的，”他暗自思忖，不知道另一个年轻人是否听到了他们的争吵。

With a heavy sigh, he pushed away from the wall, rubbing absently at his throat as he went in search of a broom.  Sorry Shinji, he thought, shaking his head as be began to clean, but if she leaves… it'd be better for all of us – especially you.  Sometimes you just have to let it go, man.  
他重重地叹了口气，从墙边推开，心不在焉地揉着喉咙，开始寻找扫帚。抱歉了，真嗣，他边打扫边想，摇了摇头，但如果她离开……对我们所有人来说都会更好——尤其是你。有时候，你不得不放手，伙计。

Ignoring the sound of the redhead banging around in her room, Touji went about the task of making it look like nothing had happened, knowing full well that Asuka would be gone by nightfall.  
无视红发女孩在房间里乒乒乓乓的声音，冬二开始着手让一切看起来像什么都没发生过，他心里清楚，明日香会在夜幕降临时离开。

**

Shinji sighed as he dried his hands on the small towel slung over his shoulder.  Almost time to go, he thought tiredly, glancing through the kitchen door at the empty dining room, and Mitzuki wants me to spend the night at her place again.  Man, at this rate I might as well just move in.  
真嗣叹了口气，用搭在肩上的小毛巾擦干双手。差不多该走了，他疲惫地想，透过厨房门望向空荡荡的餐厅，而光希又想让我在她那儿过夜。天啊，照这样下去，我干脆搬过去算了。

He shook his head, glancing up at the clock on the far wall.  "Maybe me moving out wouldn't be such a bad idea," he murmured, looking at his watch to confirm that it was indeed almost closing time, "at least that way Asuka would be rid of me."  
他摇了摇头，瞥了一眼远处墙上的时钟。“也许我搬出去并不是个坏主意，”他喃喃自语，看着手表确认确实快到关门时间了，“至少那样明日香就能摆脱我了。”

It was only through willpower that he kept himself from reaching into his pocket to touch the object therein.  He knew he should do one of two things with it – either get rid of it, or give it to its intended recipient.  If he kept holding onto it, he was afraid it might drive him insane.  
正是凭借意志力，他才克制住自己不去口袋里触摸那件物品。他知道他应该做两件事之一——要么丢掉它，要么把它交给预定的人。如果他一直留着它，他担心它可能会让他发疯。

"Hey, Shinji."  “嘿，真嗣。”

The sound of Alexander's voice brought his attention back to his surroundings.  
亚历山大的声音将他的注意力拉回到了周围的环境中。

"Come over here for a second, I wanna show you something." Shinji did what he was told, waiting as the blonde man sketched something on the piece of paper with the food order from the day before on the other side.  "What do you see?" he asked, pushing the paper across the table to Shinji.  
“过来一下，我想给你看个东西。” 真嗣照做了，等待着金发男子在一张纸上勾勒着什么，这张纸的另一面是前一天的点餐单。“你看到了什么？”他问道，将纸推到真嗣面前的桌子上。

The boy looked down.  "Ummm… it's a triangle," he replied uncertainly.  
男孩低头看去。“嗯……是个三角形，”他不太确定地回答道。

"Very good," the older man said with a grin, "now, tell me: what's wrong with it?"  
"非常好，" 年长者咧嘴笑道，"现在，告诉我：它有什么问题？"

Shinji looked closer, shrugging as he answered, "One of the sides is shorter, I guess."  
真嗣凑近了些，耸耸肩回答道，"我想，有一边比较短。"

"Right again," Alexander nodded, "so here's the next question, my young friend," he met Shinji's eyes, his tone growing serious, "if you tried to stand this up, what would happen?"  
"又答对了，" 亚历山大点头道，"那么，我的年轻朋友，下一个问题，" 他直视着真嗣的眼睛，语气变得严肃，"如果你试着把它立起来，会发生什么？"

Shinji pondered the paper for a minute, wondering what this was really all about.  "Depending on what it was made of," he said slowly, "it would stand for a while, then the weaker side would give out, I guess."  
真嗣对着那张纸沉思了一会儿，不知道这究竟是怎么回事。“取决于它是由什么制成的，”他缓缓地说，“它会支撑一段时间，然后较弱的一边会先撑不住，我想。”

"It would," the cook confirmed, "so… from all of this we can deduce that a triangle with one side that's not as, let's say dedicated, is unstable and dangerous, right?"  When Shinji nodded, the older man lowered his voice, "Are you that side, Shinji?"  
“确实如此，”厨师确认道，“所以……从这一切我们可以推断出一个三角形，如果其中一边不那么，比如说，坚定，那么它就是不稳定的，且危险的，对吗？”当真嗣点头时，年长者压低了声音，“真嗣，你是那一边吗？”

"I… don't understand." “我……不明白。”

Alexander sighed, leaning back in his chair and looking at the boy closely.  "I know something's going on with you and Mitzuki," he said quietly, "she's too goofy and gushy when you're around.  And I know something is going on – or went on – with you and Sachiko, because every time Domiyoji comes in to visit her, she looks to make sure you're not nearby before kissing him, but she's not all happy like Mitzu is."  
亚历山大叹了口气，靠回椅背上，仔细打量着那个男孩。“我知道你和光月之间有些事情，”他轻声说道，“你一在，她就变得特别傻气又热情。而且我知道你和幸子之间也有事——或者有过事——因为每次道宫来探望她时，她都会先确认你不在附近才亲吻他，但她并没有像光月那样开心。”

Shinji blushed, glancing at where the two girls were talking to each other on the far side of the restaurant.  "It's hard to explain," he said awkwardly, looking back to the older man, "but Sachiko's faithful, I can tell you that."  
真嗣脸红了，瞥了一眼餐厅另一边正在交谈的两个女孩。“很难解释，”他尴尬地说，回头看向年长的男人，“但我可以告诉你，幸子是忠诚的。”

"Yeah," the blonde man said, nodding approvingly, "I never pegged her as the cheating kind – and I don't expect you to spill your guts to me, Shinji, you hardly know me… but I do want to give you some advice, ok?"  He waited for the boy to give him an affirmative before taking a deep breath.  "An uneven triangle is a dangerous thing – especially when it's made of people.  Someone always, always ends up getting hurt if the weaker side gives out.  I know all three of you, I work with all three of you, and I'd hate to see any of you end up in pain."  
“是啊，”金发男子点头表示赞同，“我从没觉得她是那种会出轨的人——而且我也不指望你对我吐露心声，真嗣，你几乎不认识我……但我确实想给你一些建议，好吗？”他等待男孩点头同意后深吸了一口气。“不平衡的三角关系是危险的——尤其是当它涉及人的时候。总有一方，总是有一方会受伤，如果较弱的一方退缩的话。我认识你们三个，我和你们三个一起工作，我不希望看到你们中的任何一个受伤。”

He sighed, shaking his head as the boy shifted awkwardly from one foot to the other.  "I'm not saying this is all your fault," he said gently, "I doubt you went out of your way to involve yourself with either of them – you don't seem like the kind to chase after girls, am I right?"  He looked down at the paper as Shinji nodded.  "But how it got started kinda doesn't matter," he said softly, "you know?  It's happening, they're involved, you're involved, and it's going to end badly if you can't find the strength to be one of the stronger sides."  
他叹了口气，摇着头，看着男孩尴尬地从一只脚换到另一只脚。“我不是说这都是你的错，”他温和地说，“我怀疑你并没有特意去招惹她们中的任何一个——你看起来不像是那种追女孩的人，对吧？”他低头看着纸，见真嗣点头。“但事情是怎么开始的已经不重要了，”他轻声说，“你知道吗？事情已经发生了，她们牵扯其中，你也牵扯其中，如果你找不到力量成为较强的一方，这将会以糟糕的方式结束。”

He blinked as a new factor was added to the equation in the form of a slender redhead.  The girl entered the restaurant, by chance (or design, Alexander was never sure) she found Mitzuki and Sachiko… and he could hear Shinji's name mentioned, even from across the room.  
他眨了眨眼，因为一个新因素以纤细的红发女孩的形式加入了这个局面。女孩走进餐厅，偶然（或是设计，亚历山大从未确定）她找到了光希和幸子……而他能听到真嗣的名字被提及，即使隔着整个房间。

"And I think," he said quietly, nodding to where the three girls were talking, "your job just got a whole lot harder."  
“而且我认为，”他轻声说，向那三个女孩交谈的地方点了点头，“你的任务变得困难多了。”

**

Asuka walked into the Golden Temple with a frown.  Decent place, she thought, looking around.  Spying two waitresses talking to one another, she clenched her hand into a determined fist.  "Where can I find Shinji?" she asked, walking up to the duo without bothering to greet them.  
明日香皱着眉头走进了金色神殿。她环顾四周，心想，还不错的地方。看到两名女服务员正在交谈，她紧握拳头，决心满满。“我在哪儿能找到真嗣？”她走上前去问道，连招呼都懒得打。

"Shinji…?" the girl with the bandana echoed, blinking slightly, "Who are you?"  
“真嗣…？”扎着头巾的女孩重复道，微微眨眼，“你是谁？”

The redhead narrowed her eyes, but before she could snap, the dark-haired girl whispered, "Asuka… you're Asuka, aren't you?"  
红发女孩眯起眼睛，正要发作，但黑发女孩低声说道：“明日香…你是明日香，对吧？”

"And I'm guessing, you're Sachiko," Asuka replied, folding her arms over her breasts and assessing the older girl, "am I right?"  She looked closer at the other waitress, "And I suppose you're Mitzuki."  The older girl, she noticed, was bristling visibly, frowning as she looked her up and down.  
"我猜，你是幸子吧，" 明日香回答道，双臂交叉在胸前，打量着年长的女孩，"我说得对吗？" 她更仔细地看着另一位女服务员，"我猜你是光子。" 她注意到，那位年长的女孩明显在生气，皱着眉头上下打量她。

Sachiko wet her lips, looking from one girl to the other. Oh, this is bad, she thought as the two stared at each other, the redhead's single blue eye glittering with disapproval, I should find Shinji before it gets out of control.  Out of control was exactly where the situation was headed, in her opinion.  From experience, she knew that Mitzuki was fiercely possessive of things she deemed hers… and Shinji was, without a doubt, hers.  She also knew from talking to Shinji that Asuka could be very short-tempered and belligerent, and she suspected, from the way she was acting right now, that she was more than a little possessive herself.  
幸子舔了舔嘴唇，从一位女孩看到另一位。哦，这可不妙，她心想，两人互相瞪视，红发女孩那只蓝色的独眼闪烁着不满的光芒，我得在事情失控前找到真嗣。在她看来，情况正朝着失控的方向发展。根据经验，她知道光子对那些她认为是自己的东西占有欲极强……而真嗣无疑就是她的。她还从与真嗣的交谈中得知，明日香脾气急躁且好斗，而且从她现在的行为来看，她怀疑明日香自己也有很强的占有欲。

"What do you want?" Mitzuki asked flatly, not bothering to hide her attitude, "You can't call, or wait until he gets home?  What's so damn important that you have to come down here and throw-"  
"你到底想干什么？" 光子冷冷地问，毫不掩饰自己的态度，"你不能打电话，或者等他回家吗？有什么该死的重要事情，非得亲自跑来这里闹——"

"Watch it," Asuka cut her off coldly, "before you end up saying something that's gonna get you hurt.  Why I'm here is none of your business, just tell me where-"  
"小心点，" 明日香冷冷地打断她，"在你说出什么会让自己受伤的话之前。我来这里不关你的事，只要告诉我——"

"Shinji," Sachiko said suddenly, "your roommate is here to see you."  
"真嗣，" 幸子突然说道，"你的室友来看你了。"

All eyes focussed on Shinji as he approached the trio, an uncertain look on his face.  "Asuka," he said, swallowing uncomfortably at all the attention, "hi."  
所有目光都聚焦在真嗣身上，他走近三人，脸上带着不确定的表情。"明日香，"他说道，对所有人的关注感到不自在，"嗨。"

The redhead shifted her gaze from the waitress to the former Third Child.  "Shinji," she said flatly, "I need to talk to you.  Now."  
红发女孩将目光从女服务员转向了前第三适格者。“真嗣，”她平淡地说，“我有话要跟你说。现在。”

"Ok, I'll just…" he trailed off as her brow came down, "coming."  
“好的，我这就……”他话音未落，见她眉头一皱，“来了。”

"You don't have to go anywhere with her, honey," Mitzuki said calmly, reaching out to take Shinji's arm, "you're still on the clock."  
“你不必跟她去任何地方，亲爱的，”光月平静地说，伸手抓住了真嗣的手臂，“你还在上班呢。”

Sachiko took a careful step back, wondering if she really could see sparks flying between the two or if it was just her imagination.  She stood indecisive, glancing at the three others as an eerie silence stole over them.  I can't side with Asuka, she thought pensively, Mitzuki's my friend… and I work with her.  But I can't side with Mitzuki – she's being totally unreasonable, and Asuka must have a good reason for being here, because from what Shinji's told me, she's not the kind to just up and start trouble for NO reason.  Frowning slightly, she chose her side – the side she should have picked without a second thought.  
幸子小心翼翼地后退一步，心中疑惑自己是否真的看到两人之间火花四溅，还是仅仅是她的想象。她犹豫不决地站着，目光扫过其他三人，一种诡异的沉默笼罩着他们。我不能站在明日香这边，她沉思着，光希是我的朋友……而且我和她共事。但我也不能站在光希这边——她完全不讲理，而明日香来这里肯定有充分的理由，因为从真嗣告诉我的情况来看，她不是那种无缘无故挑起事端的人。她微微皱眉，选择了自己的立场——那个她本应毫不犹豫选择的立场。

"Shinji," the dark-haired girl said quietly, putting a hand on his shoulder, "remember what you told me in the alley?"  She ignored the other two girl's surprised (and suspicious) glances and waited for the boy to reluctantly nod before telling him softly, "Now is that time, Shinji."  
“真嗣，”黑发女孩轻声说道，一只手搭在他的肩上，“还记得你在小巷里对我说的话吗？”她无视了另外两个女孩惊讶（且怀疑）的目光，等待男孩不情愿地点头后，温柔地告诉他：“现在就是那个时候，真嗣。”

"What are you talking about, Sachiko?" Mitzuki asked slowly, eyeing her friend with something akin to open hostility, "Why are you taking my boyfriend into alleys?"  
“你在说什么，幸子？”光希缓缓问道，用近乎公开敌意的眼神盯着她的朋友，“你为什么要把我男朋友带到小巷里去？”

At the word boyfriend, Asuka visibly… clenched.  Her entire body seemed to go ridged, and her eye narrowed to a slit.   
一听到“男朋友”这个词，明日香明显地……紧绷了。她的整个身体似乎都变得僵硬，眼睛眯成了一条缝。

"Shinji," Sachiko murmured, ignoring Mitzuki's query, "honesty, remember?  You said-"  
“真嗣，”幸子轻声说道，忽略了光希的问题，“诚实，记得吗？你说过——”

"I've heard just about enough of this shit!" Mitzuki cut in angrily, "'Honesty,' Sachiko?  Like, this honesty?"  
“我听够了这些废话！”光希愤怒地打断道，“‘诚实’，幸子？就像，这种诚实？”

Sachiko winced as the other girl jabbed her forefinger into her chest.  "Mitzu," she said quickly, licking her lips, "It's not what you-"  
Sachiko 皱了皱眉，因为另一个女孩用食指戳了戳她的胸口。“Mitzu，”她迅速说道，舔了舔嘴唇，“这不是你想的那样——”

"Shut up, you little whore!" Mitzuki snapped, tightening her hold on Shinji's arm.  "You tried to steal him from me, didn't you?  Don't lie to me! I can see it all over your face!  I can't believe you, you bitch!!"  
“闭嘴，你这个小婊子！”Mitzuki 厉声喝道，紧紧抓住 Shinji 的手臂。“你想从我这里抢走他，对吧？别对我撒谎！我全都能从你脸上看出来！真不敢相信你，你这个贱人！！”

"Shinji?" Sachiko said unevenly, trying to focus only on his eyes, "In my apartment… when we kissed," Asuka and Mitzuki both gasped, but Sachiko hurried on.  "I felt something… it was hot, and it was incredible, but it wasn't love, Shinji!  I finally figured out what I see in you – I see your love of others, and I want to be like that, don't you understand?  You have to choose now, Shinji!  Honesty – you said that's what was most important to-"  
“Shinji？”Sachiko 不稳地说道，试图只盯着他的眼睛，“在我公寓里……我们接吻的时候，”Asuka 和 Mitzuki 都倒吸了一口气，但 Sachiko 急忙继续说。“我感受到了一些东西……它是热的，它是难以置信的，但它不是爱，Shinji！我终于明白了我对你的感觉——我看到了你对别人的爱，我也想变得那样，你明白吗？你现在必须做出选择，Shinji！诚实——你说过那是最重要的——”

"I'm leaving," Asuka cut in coldly, "That's all I came here to tell you, Shinji.  I'm leaving tonight."  She nodded as Shinji gaped at her.  "That's right.  I can't stand seeing you with someone else, Shinji – are you happy now?  You've finally gotten me to say I love you, you fucking asshole!"  She turned away.  "Goodbye."  
"我要走了，" 明日香冷冷地打断道，"我来这里就是要告诉你这个，真嗣。我今晚就走。" 她点头看着真嗣目瞪口呆的样子。"没错。我无法忍受看到你和别人在一起，真嗣——你现在满意了吗？你终于让我说出了我爱你，你这个混蛋！" 她转身离开。"再见。"

"Wait!" Shinji called, moving to follow her.  
"等等！" 真嗣喊道，试图追上去。

"What are you doing!?" Mitzuki gasped, holding him firmly as he tried to walk away.  "Let her go, Shinji!  I can make you happy – you don't need her!!"  
"你在干什么！？" 光月惊呼，紧紧抓住他，不让他离开。"让她走吧，真嗣！我能让你幸福——你不需要她！！"

Sachiko flushed as Shinji turned his eyes to her.  "Honesty," she whispered softly, trying not to see the angry glare Mitzuki gave her as she too turned away.  
Sachiko 的脸颊因 Shinji 转向她的目光而泛红。“诚实，”她轻声低语，尽量不去看 Mitzuki 投来的愤怒目光，她也转过身去。

"Mitzuki," Shinji began, "I… need to talk to Asuka, I-"  
“Mitzuki，”Shinji 开口道，“我…需要和 Asuka 谈谈，我-”

"WHY?" Mitzuki shouted frantically.  "Just be mine, Shinji!  That's all you have to do.  I'll make you so happy – just stay mine!  Stay with me."  Her face crumpled as Sachiko shook her head and walked away.  She leaned forward and kissed Shinji gently, closing her eyes as their lips met.  "I never had you," she breathed as they parted, keeping her eyes closed as she pressed her forehead to his and draped her arms over his shoulders, "did I…?"  
“为什么？”Mitzuki 疯狂地喊道。“只要属于我就好，Shinji！这就是你该做的。我会让你非常快乐——只要留在我身边！和我在一起。”她的脸因 Sachiko 摇头走开而扭曲。她倾身轻轻吻了 Shinji，闭上眼睛，当他们的唇相触时。“我从未拥有过你，”他们分开时她轻声说，闭着眼睛将额头贴在他的额头上，双臂搭在他的肩膀上，“对吗…？”

Shinji's silence was the only reply she needed.  
真嗣的沉默是她唯一需要的回答。

"Please leave now, Shinji," she whispered, stepping away from him and letting her arms fall to her sides, "please."  
“请现在离开，真嗣，”她低声说道，从他身边退开，双臂垂在身侧，“求你了。”

"But I-" “但我——”

"Don't say anything.  I don't want to hear you say you're sorry, and I don't want to hear you rationalize anything we've done together." A single tear ran from each still-closed eye as she lowered her voice.  "And I don't want to see your face," she said, her voice breaking, "and I don't want you to touch me and try and make it ok, do you understand?  I just… I want to be alone."  
"别说话。我不想听你说对不起，也不想听你为我们的所作所为找理由。" 她压低声音，每只紧闭的眼睛都流下一滴泪。"我不想看到你的脸，"她的声音哽咽了，"也不想让你碰我，试图让它变得好些，你明白吗？我只是……我想一个人待着。"

Listening to her own, uneven breathing, the waitress could easily make out the sound of the brown-haired boy first shifting from one foot to the other, then slowly walking towards the door.  As it opened, then closed, Mitzuki slowly sank down to the floor, keeping her eyes closed and trying to pretend that she had ever had a place in Shinji Ikari's heart.  
听着自己不均匀的呼吸声，女服务员能清楚地听到那个棕色头发的男孩先是左右脚交替站立，然后慢慢地向门口走去。当门打开又关上时，Mitzuki 缓缓地蹲下身子，闭着眼睛，试图假装自己在碇真嗣的心中曾有过一席之地。

**

Halfway, Asuka thought angrily, stuffing another pair of jeans into a suitcase, halfway done.  Few more essentials, and I'm done – I can come back for the rest.  She shook her head.  "God," she muttered, "I should have fucking known.  Even if I had said it sooner, it wouldn't have been enough."  
半途而废，明日香愤怒地想着，又往行李箱里塞了一条牛仔裤，半途而废。再收拾几样必需品，我就完事了——我可以回来拿剩下的。她摇了摇头。"天啊，"她低声咒骂，"我早该他妈的知道。即使我早点说出口，也不够。"

"A-Asuka?" "A-明日香？"

She looked up briefly as Shinji pushed the door open, resting his hands on his knees as he tried to catch his breath.  "What do you want?" she muttered, "Trying to get a third girl in bed with you?  Well, sorry – I'm not a slut like them… pervert."  
她抬头瞥了一眼，只见真嗣推开门，双手撑在膝盖上试图喘口气。“你想要什么？”她咕哝道，“想再拉一个女孩上床吗？抱歉——我可不像她们那样随便……变态。”

"It's… not like that," Shinji gasped, "Sachiko… I… we just kissed once… she's… got a boyfriend."  
“不是那样的，”真嗣喘着气说，“幸子……我……我们只是亲了一次……她……有男朋友的。”

Asuka laughed mirthlessly.  "Oh that makes everything ok!" she snorted.  "'I'm only cheating on you with one girl, honey, it's no big deal!'"  
明日香冷笑一声。“哦，那一切就没事了！”她嗤之以鼻。“‘亲爱的，我只和一个女孩出轨，没什么大不了的！’”

"Cheating?" Shinji echoed.  
“出轨？”真嗣重复道。

"Why didn't you wait for me?!?" Asuka shouted suddenly, throwing a pair of gym shorts at the startled boy.  "You KNEW damnit!!  You knew I loved you!!"  
“你为什么不等我？！？”明日香突然大喊，将一条运动短裤扔向惊慌失措的男孩。“你明明知道！！你明明知道我爱你！！”

"I didn't," Shinji replied honestly, "I really didn't, Asuka.  I wanted you too, but I-"  
"我没有，" 真嗣诚实地回答，"我真的没有，明日香。我也想要你，但是，我——"

"Just go away," the redhead muttered, "I don't wanna hear your lame excuses anymore."  
"走开吧，" 红发女孩低声嘟囔，"我不想再听你那些蹩脚的借口了。"

Shinji scrubbed his right hand through his hair, watching her pack her things in panicked silence for a moment. If I let her go, he thought frantically, I'll never see her again… I'll never have a chance to be close to her.  
真嗣用右手抓了抓头发，看着她在慌乱的沉默中收拾东西。如果我让她走，他疯狂地想，我将再也见不到她……我再也没有机会靠近她了。

His panic suddenly fell away, replaced by a mixture of determination and anger.  "You're not going to leave," he whispered, "not like this."  
他的恐慌突然消散，取而代之的是决心与愤怒的混合。“你不会就这样离开，”他低语，“不会像这样。”

"What are you-?" “你这是要——？”

Asuka's surprised question was cut off as Shinji grabbed her by the upper arm and spun her around, staring into her eye as he pushed her up against the wall and kissed her.  
明日香惊讶的问话被切断了，因为真嗣抓住她的上臂，将她转过身来，盯着她的眼睛，将她推到墙上并吻了她。

"Hmph??"  "哼？"

The former Second Child's startled yelp only served to harden Shinji's resolve, and rather than releasing her, he held her tighter, pinning her arms to her sides as she struggled and gently sucking her bottom lip into his mouth.  His grip loosened slightly as the fight slowly drained out of her, her movements becoming slower and less urgent even as her breathing grew more rapid.  
前二号机驾驶员的惊叫声反而坚定了真嗣的决心，他没有松手，反而将她抱得更紧，将她的双臂紧紧压在身侧，同时温柔地吸吮着她的下唇。随着她的挣扎逐渐减弱，他的握力也稍稍放松，她的动作变得迟缓，不再那么急切，尽管呼吸变得更加急促。

As he continued to kiss her, Asuka's arms slowly fell to her sides, the urge to fend him off gone like it had never been.  When he finally released her arms, sliding his hands around her slender waist, she took the opportunity… to slap him.  
当他继续亲吻她时，明日香的双臂慢慢垂到身侧，原本想要推开他的冲动仿佛从未存在过。当他最终松开她的手臂，双手滑向她纤细的腰际时，她抓住了机会……给了他一巴掌。

"Don't you ever," she whispered as he broke away, his eyes wide as he touched the angry red hand print on his cheek, "ever try and hold me down again, do you understand?"  As he nodded his understanding, she stared into his face, searching it closely before speaking.  "What do you want, Shinji?" she asked plainly, making no move to push him away, but not encouraging him either, "Tell me now… no more games… no more running away… what…do you… want…?"  
"你敢再这么做，" 她在他挣脱时低声说道，他的眼睛因触摸着脸颊上那愤怒的红印而睁大，"再敢试图压制我，明白吗？" 他点头表示理解，她凝视着他的脸，仔细打量后才开口，"你想要什么，真嗣？" 她直截了当地问，没有推开他，也没有鼓励他，"现在告诉我…不再玩游戏…不再逃避…你…到底…想要…什么？"

Shinji nodded again, all of the uncertainty leaving his features as he replied softly,  
真嗣再次点头，所有的犹豫从他的表情中消失，他轻声回答道，

"I want you." "我想要你。"

"Think it's that easy, do you?" Asuka said softly, holding his gaze, "Just three words, and I fall into your arms, confessing my love for you?  Just… forget this whole little fucked up dating thing and just let myself be yours?"  
“以为那么简单，是吗？”明日香轻声说道，目光紧锁着他，“就三个字，我便投入你的怀抱，向你表白我的爱意？就……忘掉这段乱七八糟的约会，让我完全属于你？”

Shinji stared back at her, his tone entirely level and calm as he whispered,  
真嗣回望着她，语气平静如水，低声说道，

"Yes." "是的。"

The redhead considered his calm demeanor for a moment, trying to decide if there was any humor in his statement whatsoever.  When he made no further comment, she asked, "What would you do with me then, Shinji?  We're all alone."  She lowered her voice, idly running her forefinger across his chest, unsure herself if she was teasing or serious.  "Tell me what you would do if I said what you want me to say."  
红发女孩打量着他平静的神态，试图判断他这句话里是否有任何幽默的成分。见他没有进一步的评论，她问道：“那么，真嗣，你会对我做什么呢？我们孤男寡女。”她压低声音，漫不经心地用食指划过他的胸膛，连她自己也不确定是在挑逗还是认真。“告诉我，如果我说出你想听的话，你会怎么做？”

Shinji nodded slowly.  He had gone over how he would confess his feelings for her, down to the exact wording… but he had not counted on her level reaction – or the way she watched him so closely, seeking any falsehood or dishonesty.  Realizing that all of his planning had been for naught, he decided to fly by instinct and see where it might lead.  
真嗣缓缓点头。他早已反复斟酌过如何向她表白心意，甚至连具体措辞都考虑周详……但他没料到她的反应会如此激烈，也没想到她会如此密切地观察他，寻找任何虚假或不诚实的迹象。意识到所有的计划都已徒劳无功，他决定凭直觉行事，看看会走向何方。

"I would… want to test your theory on thermal expansion," Shinji murmured, amazed that his voice was so level when speaking those bold, almost challenging words.  
“我……想验证一下你对热膨胀的理论，”真嗣低声说道，惊讶于自己的声音在说出这些大胆、几乎带有挑战性的话语时竟能如此平稳。

Asuka's eye widened, and her finger stopped its slow movement across his thin torso.  "And you think I'll let you?" she murmured, leaning back and letting the wall support her, "you think I'd let some pervert like you just… just…"  
明日香的眼睛睁大了，她的手指在他瘦削的身躯上缓慢移动的动作也停了下来。“你以为我会让你这么做吗？”她低声说着，向后靠在墙上支撑身体，“你以为我会让像你这样的变态就这样……就这样……”

She trailed off, shivering slightly as she felt his right hand slowly sliding up her side, pulling her shirt up as it went.  She gasped softly as he gently cupped her breast, never once looking away from her eye.  "Yes," he whispered, slowly exploring the soft skin under his palm, "I think you would let… me."  
她话音渐弱，微微颤抖着，感觉到他的右手缓缓沿着她的侧身滑上，将她的衬衫向上拉起。她轻声喘息，当他温柔地握住她的乳房，目光始终未曾从她的眼睛移开。“是的，”他低语，手掌下柔软的肌肤慢慢探索，“我想你会让我……”

As confident as he sounded, Shinji's heart was beating at least twice its normal speed, and he was using all of his concentration to keep his breathing and voice level.  He knew what he was doing was tantamount to insanity, but he felt it was worth the risk of bodily injury, if only she would understand and acknowledge that he wasn't just toying with her.  
尽管他听起来自信满满，但真嗣的心跳至少是平常的两倍快，他用尽全力保持呼吸和声音的平稳。他知道自己所做之事无异于疯狂，但他觉得哪怕冒着身体受伤的风险也值得，只要她能理解并承认他并非只是在戏弄她。

"And… and if I told you to stop touching me and get out?" Asuka stammered, trying to stay rational as he continued to gently caress her.  
“而……如果我让你停止触摸我并离开呢？”明日香结巴着，努力保持理智，而他继续温柔地抚摸她。

"I'd be sad," the boy whispered, very slowly reaching out and touching her face with his free hand, "but I would stop.  I want to be with you, Asuka… I want all of you."  He smiled, moving his hand down from her breast to one of the seven scars on her body and tracing it gently, "if I can't have you all," he breathed, "then I don't want you."  
"我会很难过，"男孩低声说道，缓缓伸出另一只手，轻触她的脸颊，"但我可以停下来。我想和你在一起，明日香……我想要你的全部。" 他微笑着，手从她的胸部移到她身上七道疤痕中的一道，温柔地描绘着，"如果我不能拥有你的全部，"他轻声说，"那我宁愿不要你。"

The redhead trembled as the boy moved his hand from one scar to the next… and then the next… diligently examining the wounds with his fingertips.  "If I said I want the same thing," she asked, her voice barely audible, "do you think it will change who I am?  Do you think us being together would make the world a magical, shining place?"  She smiled bitterly, suppressing her tears with brutal force.  "Do you think it would bring Misato back?" she asked cruelly, "Or give me back my eye?  Or my arm?"  
红发女孩颤抖着，男孩的手从一个疤痕移到下一个……再下一个……用指尖仔细检查着每一处伤口。"如果我说我也想要同样的东西，"她问道，声音几乎听不见，"你认为这会改变我是谁吗？你认为我们在一起会让世界变得神奇而闪亮吗？" 她苦涩地笑了笑，用极大的力量抑制住泪水。"你认为这能带回美里吗？"她冷酷地问，"还是能还我眼睛？或是我的手臂？"

For a long moment, Shinji said nothing.  Then, just as Asuka was on the brink of pushing him away and telling him to leave, he murmured, "No, I don't."  He slowly leaned forward, giving her ample opportunity to move away, and kissed her softly on the lips.  "I don't want to change who you are," he said gently as he broke away, "and I don't think anything that's been lost will magically come back.  What I do know," he whispered, still touching her scars, "is that…"  
有好一会儿，真嗣什么也没说。然后，就在明日香快要推开他并让他离开的时候，他低声说道：“不，我不愿意。”他缓缓前倾，给了她足够的时间避开，然后轻轻地吻了她的唇。“我不想改变你，”他温柔地说着，离开她的唇，“我也不认为失去的东西会奇迹般地回来。我所知道的是，”他低语着，依旧触摸着她的伤疤，“那就是……”

"Yes?" she prompted as he trailed off, believing wholeheartedly that he was going to say 'I love you.'  
“什么？”她催促道，全心全意地相信他会说出“我爱你”。

Shinji surprised her by instead confessing, "You make me happy.  When we're together, I feel like nothing else in the world matters.  I'd tell you I love you," he said softly, smiling a bit as he dropped his eyes, "but I think, maybe… you already know."  
真嗣却出乎意料地坦白道：“你让我感到快乐。当我们在一起时，我觉得世界上其他什么都不重要。我会告诉你我爱你，”他轻声说着，微微一笑，垂下眼帘，“但我想，也许……你已经知道了。”

So there it is, Asuka thought, completely uncertain, he just said he loves me – no, she corrected herself, he didn't say it, she smiled, and I guess he didn't really have to.  
原来如此，明日香心想，完全不确定，他刚刚说他爱我——不，她纠正自己，他没说出口，她笑了，我想他其实不必说。

She blinked as Shinji carefully ran the ball of his thumb under her eye, wiping the dampness that had been gathering there on his shirt.   
她眨了眨眼，看着真嗣小心翼翼地用拇指球在她眼角下擦拭，将积聚在那里的湿润抹在他的衬衫上。

"You don't have to cry."  
“你不必哭。”

The redhead nodded, blushing faintly at her display of weakness.  Deliberately, she took his hand and held it over the scar on her lower abdomen.  "You know," she said flatly, holding his gaze, "that it might take a long time for me to be able to give you everything that I am, right?"  
红发女孩点了点头，因展示出脆弱而微微脸红。她故意握住他的手，放在自己下腹的伤疤上。“你知道，”她平静地说，目光坚定地看着他，“我可能需要很长时间才能完全向你敞开心扉，对吧？”

"Yeah, I know," the former Third Child replied, slowly outlining the damaged tissue.  
“嗯，我知道，”前第三适格者回答，缓缓地描绘着那处受损的组织。

"You said you wanted all of me," Asuka whispered, slowly extending her right hand and brushing the backs of partially synthetic fingers across his cheek, "but I can't give you that – not all at once.  You'll have to be patient with me, and let me work it all out, and let me just… just…"  
“你说过你想要全部的我，”明日香低声说，慢慢伸出右手，用半合成手指的背面轻抚他的脸颊，“但我无法一下子给你全部。你需要对我有耐心，让我慢慢理清一切，让我……就……”

Shinji simply nodded as she trailed off, taking her hand and keeping it against his face.  
真嗣只是点了点头，当她说话声渐渐消失时，他握住她的手，让它贴在自己的脸上。

Pulling her hand away, Asuka slid her arms over his shoulders, pulling his lips back to hers to kiss him deeply.  "If I give you all of me," she breathed, resting her head on his shoulder, "I'll want the same from you, Shinji.  I want to know – I need to know – that you're all mine."  
明日香抽回手，双臂环上他的肩膀，将他的唇再次拉向自己，深深地吻着他。“如果我把全部都给你，”她轻声说道，头靠在他的肩上，“我也希望从你那里得到同样的回应，真嗣。我想要知道——我需要知道——你是完全属于我的。”

"I'll show you." “我会向你证明。”

So saying, Shinji reached down and gently grasped the bottom of her shirt, pulling it up carefully and watching for any sign of hesitance or disapproval from the girl.  Asuka closed her eye, putting her arms up over her head and allowing him to render her topless.  She kept her eye tightly closed as she felt his fingers once again moving over her skin, avoiding the most sensitive spots, for the time being, and simply familiarizing himself with her body.  
说完这话，真嗣俯身轻轻抓住她衬衫的下摆，小心翼翼地向上拉起，观察着女孩是否有任何犹豫或不悦的迹象。明日香闭上眼睛，将双臂举过头顶，任由他将自己脱至上身赤裸。她紧闭双眼，感受着他的手指再次在她的肌肤上游走，暂时避开最敏感的部位，只是熟悉她的身体。

"Did you go this far with Mitzuki…?" she whispered.  
“你和光月做过这种事吗……？”她低声问道。

She waited in silence for over a minute, frowning slightly as he said nothing.  When she opened her eye to find out why, she found him smiling softly.  "I'm not going to tell you," he said gently, sliding his hands around to caress her back, "because you don't really want to know, one way or the other."  She opened her mouth to protest, but he kissed her before she could, pressing himself up against her and letting his hand move down to cover her rear.  
她静静等待了一分多钟，微微皱眉，因为他一言不发。当她睁开眼睛想弄清楚原因时，却发现他正温柔地微笑着。“我不会告诉你的，”他轻声说着，双手滑到背后轻抚她的背，“因为你其实并不想知道，无论哪种答案。”她正要开口反驳，但他先吻了她，将身体紧贴着她，手顺势滑下覆盖住她的臀部。

When he finally let her speak again, Asuka smiled.  "You're a jerk," she murmured, blushing as she un-tucked his shirt.  
当他终于让她再次开口时，明日香笑了。“你这个混蛋，”她低声说道，脸颊泛红，同时帮他解开衬衫的下摆。

"Maybe," Shinji retorted, slipping a finger into the hem of her pants and slowly sliding it around to the front.  
“也许吧，”真嗣反驳道，将手指滑入她的裤边，缓缓绕到前方。

The redhead found her breathing becoming a touch erratic as the boy slowly unfastened her jeans, drawing the zipper down with delicious slowness.  "Don't hurt me," she whispered suddenly, laying her hand over his as he parted the front of her pants, revealing the top of her red and white striped panties.  "I mean, I know it's going to hurt," she clarified, blushing deeper, "but – don't hurt me, Shinji."  
红发女孩发现自己的呼吸变得有些不稳，男孩慢慢地解开她的牛仔裤，拉链缓缓下滑，那种缓慢让人感到愉悦。“别弄疼我，”她突然轻声说道，把手放在他的手上，随着他分开她裤子的前部，露出了红色和白色条纹的内裤边缘。“我是说，我知道会疼，”她补充道，脸更红了，“但是——真嗣，别弄疼我。”

The former Third Child made no reply, he simply smiled and knelt in front of her, carefully drawing her jeans down.  
曾经的第三适格者没有回答，只是微笑着跪在她面前，小心翼翼地帮她脱下牛仔裤。

As gently as he could, Shinji showed her exactly what she meant to him…  
慎二尽可能温柔地向她展示了自己对她的全部心意……

**

Asuka woke feeling stiff.  She groaned as she felt the hard floor digging into her hipbone.  "Next time," she whispered, blinking in the darkness as she found Shinji's sleeping face inches from hers, "we do it in bed."  
明日香醒来时感到身体僵硬。她呻吟着，感觉到坚硬的地板硌着她的髋骨。“下次，”她低声说道，在黑暗中眨眼寻找着离她仅几英寸远的真嗣的睡脸，“我们在床上做。”

As she was about to lay her head against his chest, she became aware of the sound of a third person's breathing in the room, blinking harder, she looked up to the bed and found Touji looking back at her.  
正当她准备将头靠在他胸前时，她察觉到房间里第三个人的呼吸声，她眨了眨眼，抬头望向床铺，发现东治正回望着她。

"Don't say anything," the former Fourth Child whispered as the redhead opened her mouth, frowning deeply, "you'll wake up loverboy."  
"别说话，"前第四适格者低声说道，红发女孩刚要开口，他便皱起眉头，"你会吵醒你的小情人的。"

"What do you want?" Asuka demanded, ignoring his advice.  "And where's your knife?"  
"你想干什么？"明日香质问道，无视了他的忠告。"还有，你的刀呢？"

Touji raised his hands, the smile he had been wearing giving way to a serious expression.  "What do I want…?" he mused, "Well, I'll tell you, Souryu… what I want is to see my friend happy."  He leaned down, his eyes intense as he studied her face in the near-dark.  "Are you going to make that happen?" he asked softly, "Or are you going to crush him again?"  
冬二举起双手，脸上一直挂着的微笑被严肃的表情所取代。“我想要什么……？”他沉思着，“好吧，我要告诉你，剑介……我想要的是看到我的朋友幸福。”他俯下身，在昏暗中仔细观察她的脸庞。“你会让这一切发生吗？”他轻声问道，“还是会再次伤害他？”

The girl flushed, averting her eye.  "Go fuck yourself, Suzuhara," she whispered, feeling Shinji stir slightly.  
女孩脸红了，移开视线。“去你的，铃原，”她低声说道，感觉到真嗣微微动了动。

The dark haired boy waited until his friend stilled once more before speaking.  "I'm not kidding, Red," he whispered, "you and I know that a simple fuck doesn't mean shit… so tell me: did you fuck him?  Or was it more?"  
黑发男孩等到他的朋友再次静止后才开口。“我不是在开玩笑，小红，”他低声说，“你我都知道，一次简单的性爱毫无意义……所以告诉我：你和他上床了吗？还是更进一步？”

"It's none of your goddamned bus-"  
"这关你他妈的屁事-"

"The hell it isn't!" Touji hissed, his eyes flashing, "I may not be the best guy to have around.  Yeah, I'm lazy… yeah, I have some problems with my girl – but you know something?  I don't lie – not to my friends, and I sure as hell don't lie to the people I love.  Now tell me, do you-"  
"放屁！" 冬二低声咆哮，眼中闪着怒火，"我可能不是个好相处的人。没错，我懒惰……没错，我和女朋友有些问题——但你知道吗？我从不对我朋友撒谎，更不会对我在乎的人撒谎。现在告诉我，你-"

"Shut up," Asuka whispered tiredly, "Ok?  Just… shut up."  She laid her head down on Shinji's chest, closing her eye.  "What do you want to hear, Fourth Child?  Huh?  That I'll always love him?  How the fuck should I know?  No one besides my mother has ever shown me that they care… just her and him."  She lowered her voice, "I think I will… I mean, I think about him all the time, I want to be close to him."  She blushed, "I let him make love to me, but tomorrow?  Next week?  A year from now…?"  
"闭嘴，" 明日香疲惫地轻声说，"好吗？就……闭嘴。" 她把头靠在真嗣的胸口，闭上了眼睛。"你想听什么，第四适格者？嗯？说我永远爱他？我他妈怎么知道？除了我妈，从没人向我展示过他们的关心……只有她和真嗣。" 她压低了声音，"我想我会……我是说，我无时无刻不在想他，我想靠近他。" 她脸红了，"我让他与我做爱，但明天？下周？一年后……？

As she trailed off, Touji sighed.  "What you're looking for," he told her calmly, "it doesn't exist, Asuka.  You want the sure thing – you want to know that he'll always love you and you'll always love him, but you know something?  That's a dream.  You can't spend your whole life wondering if he's going to leave in the morning… or if you're going to wake up one day and realize that it was all in your head – you've got to live for now, and fuck the rest."  
"她话音未落，冬二叹了口气。“你在寻找的东西，”他平静地告诉她，“并不存在，明日香。你想要的是确定无疑的东西——你希望知道他会永远爱你，你也会永远爱他，但你知道吗？那只是一个梦。你不能一辈子都在猜测他早上会不会离开……或者有一天你会醒来，意识到这一切都只是你的幻想——你必须活在当下，其他的都见鬼去吧。”

"You're so full of shit," the redhead whispered, her body shaking as a tear slid down her cheek, "you think you know so damn much with your, 'Oh, love's no big deal to me, I can take it or leave it' bullshit!  You can't even fucking talk to your girlfriend about what you want because you're too busy living your little fucked up here-and-now fantasy, well I got news for you, shithead, Hikari's gonna dump your ass.  You think you can just live for the now?  Try it when you're all alone, fucker!"  
"“你满嘴胡言，”红发女孩低声说道，身体因泪水滑落脸颊而颤抖，“你以为你懂得那么多，什么‘哦，爱情对我来说没什么大不了的，我可以接受也可以放弃’的鬼话！你甚至不能和你女朋友谈论你想要什么，因为你太忙于活在你那该死的、扭曲的当下幻想中，我有消息告诉你，混蛋，光会甩了你。你以为你可以只活在当下？试试当你孤身一人时，混蛋！”

"You know what I think?" Shinji said softly, startling both of the other Children, "I think maybe you should both calm down and think about what you're saying."  As they gaped at him, he continued, keeping his eyes closed as he spoke.  "I'm not the smartest guy around," he said slowly, "but I know that I love Asuka.  I know that all the time I spent trying to rationalize the reasons she wouldn't tell me she loved me first, and wondering if maybe it was all in my mind… I'll never get back."   
"你知道我怎么想吗？" 真嗣轻声说道，吓了另外两个孩子一跳，"我觉得你们俩或许应该冷静下来，想想自己在说什么。" 他们目瞪口呆地看着他，他继续说道，闭着眼睛说话。"我不是最聪明的人，" 他缓缓地说，"但我知道我爱明日香。我知道我花了那么多时间试图合理化她为什么不先告诉我她爱我，以及是否这一切都只是我的想象……那些时间我再也找不回来了。"

He opened his eyes, staring up at the ceiling as he went on.  "Asuka will never be my first," he said regretfully, "I can't get that back either, and I rushed into it with someone else because I was too cowardly to tell her I loved her first… but I'll tell you something – she can sure as hell be my only, from now on.  And I can tell her, honestly, without a doubt, that right now I love her with all my heart and soul."  He sighed.  "I know it sounds corny, but if that's all I've got, it has to be enough.  I can't say it will last forever, but I'll be damned if I give up on it before it even starts."  
他睁开眼睛，盯着天花板继续说。"明日香永远不会是我的初恋，" 他遗憾地说，"我也无法找回那段时光，我因为太懦弱而不敢先告诉她我爱她，就匆匆和别人在一起……但我要告诉你们一件事——她绝对可以从此成为我的唯一。我可以诚实地、毫无疑问地告诉她，此时此刻，我全心全意地爱着她。" 他叹了口气。"我知道这听起来很老套，但如果这就是我所有的，那就必须足够了。我不能保证它会永远持续，但如果我还没开始就放弃，那我真是该死。"

"What the fuck was that?" Touji asked after a moment of silence, "You trying to say we should just shut up and stop fighting about which of us is right?"  
"那他妈是什么意思？" 沉默片刻后，冬二问道，"你是想说我们应该闭嘴，不再争论谁对谁错吗？"

"No," Shinji replied immediately, "I'm saying she shouldn't worry about what's going to happen tomorrow, and you should!  Touji," he said sadly, "I love you like a brother, but if you don't shut the fuck up and tell Hikari that you love her, you're going to end up single… and soon.  She's running out of patience, anyone can see that.  You know you love her, and you know she loves you – so just fucking say it already!!"  
"不，" 真嗣立刻回答，"我是说她不应该担心明天会发生什么，而你应该担心！冬二，"他悲伤地说，"我爱你如兄弟，但如果你不他妈的闭嘴，告诉光你爱她，你很快就会单身……而且很快。她已经快没耐心了，谁都看得出来。你知道你爱她，你也知道她爱你——所以就他妈的说出来吧！！"

The former Second and Fourth Children stared open-mouthed at the normally quiet Third, taking in the deep scowl on his face as he looked from one to the other.  Asuka looked at Touji, who looked back and shrugged slightly.  
前二号和四号适格者目瞪口呆地看着平时沉默寡言的三号，他正皱着眉头从一个人看向另一个人。明日香看着冬二，冬二回望她，微微耸了耸肩。

Abruptly, the two started laughing.  
突然间，两人开始大笑起来。

"What?" Shinji demanded, blushing as his determined look faded away, "What's so funny?"  
“什么？” 真嗣追问道，脸颊泛红，坚定的神情逐渐消失，“有什么好笑的？”

"You," Asuka giggled, hugging him tightly, "you're so serious!"  Her voice lowered and she feigned a frown, "'Tell that girl you love her, son, or she's gonna leave you!'"  
“你，” 明日香咯咯笑着，紧紧抱住他，“你太严肃了！” 她的声音放低，假装皱起眉头，“‘告诉那女孩你爱她，儿子，不然她就要离开你了！’”

Touji howled, holding his sides and doubling over on the bed.  
冬二嚎叫着，双手抱腹，在床上弯下了腰。

"It's not funny," Shinji grumbled.  "It's not funn-"  
“这不好笑，”真嗣咕哝道。“这并不好笑——”

He was cut off as Asuka kissed him gently.  "Shhh," she whispered as they parted, "you're sweet, Shinji."  
他被明日香温柔的吻打断了。“嘘——”他们分开时，她低语道，“你真可爱，真嗣。”

Touji rose from the bed.  "Here," he said, wiping tears of laughter from his eyes and chuckling again.  "You guys get dressed, I gotta go make a call."  
冬二从床上坐起来。“给，”他说着，擦去笑出的眼泪，又轻笑了一声。“你们穿好衣服，我得去打个电话。”

Shinji blinked in confusion as Asuka waited for the Fourth to close to door, then got to her feet, stifling a groan of pain as she stretched.  "Where are we going?" he asked, exasperated.  
真嗣困惑地眨了眨眼，而明日香等到第四适格者关上门后，才站起身来，伸展身体时强忍着疼痛的呻吟。“我们要去哪儿？”他有些不耐烦地问。

"Mmmm," Asuka hummed, smiling, "you're such a dork.  We're going out with Touji and Hikari, dummy."  
“嗯——”明日香哼了一声，笑着说，“你真是个呆子。我们要和冬二还有光一起出去，傻瓜。”

"We are?" "我们是的？"

"We are." "我们是。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

The redhead smiled softly.  "I think you know," she said quietly.  
红发女子温柔地笑了笑。  “我想你知道，”她轻声说道。

"Yeah… I guess I do."  
"是啊……我想是的。"

Shinji got to his feet, heading towards the bathroom.  "Asuka," he said softly, pausing at the door  
真嗣站起身，朝浴室走去。“明日香，”他在门口轻声说道，停下了脚步

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"You're not going to leave… are you?"  
"你不会离开的……对吧？"

For a very long moment, there was only silence behind him.  He thought about all that had happened since the angels had been defeated, from the beach, to Sachiko, to Mitzuki, to last night, it flashed through his mind like a flare in the darkness of a moonless night.  He knew that the redhead was scared – even if she would never admit it – and that the idea of letting anyone close to her was still terrifying to her, even after all they had been through and done together.  
在很长的一段时间里，他身后只有沉默。他回想起自从天使被击败后发生的所有事情，从海滩到幸子，再到光子，再到昨晚，这一切在他脑海中如同一道无月之夜的闪光。他知道红发女孩害怕——即使她永远不会承认——而且即使经历了这么多共同的事情，让她接受任何人靠近的想法依然令她恐惧。

But he also knew that he was happy with her, and that, even though he said he couldn't truly promise her forever… he would: just to see her smile.  
但他也知道，和她在一起他感到幸福，即使他说过无法真正承诺永远……他愿意：只为看到她的微笑。

"No, Shinji," Asuka whispered softly, "I'm not – not unless you tell me too."  
“不，真嗣，”明日香轻声细语，“我不会——除非你告诉我这么做。”

Shinji smiled. "Then I guess," he mused, "you'll have to stay here forever."  
真嗣微笑着。“那么我想，”他沉思道，“你得永远留在这里了。”

"Guess so." “看来是这样。”

He smiled.  "I'll get dressed now," he whispered, opening the bathroom door.  
他笑了笑。“我现在去穿衣服，”他低声说着，打开了浴室的门。

"You do that," Asuka replied softly, smiling as she added, "I'll be here, Shinji."  
"你去做吧，" 明日香轻声回答，微笑着补充道，"我会在这里，真嗣。"

Shinji nodded, knowing that she meant more than just when he got out of the bathroom.  
真嗣点头，知道她的话不仅仅是指他洗完澡出来的时候。

"I know." "我知道。"

Epilogue 尾声

"So I've decided to focus on school," Shinji was saying, "I'm sorry, Mister Davies."  
"所以我决定专注于学业，" 真嗣正在说，"对不起，戴维斯先生。"

"It's alright," Alexander replied, shrugging slightly.  "I understand life's gotta come first."  
"没事的，" 亚历山大回答，微微耸肩。"我明白生活总是优先的。"

"Thanks…" Shinji murmured, taking Asuka's hand in his.  "Tell Mister Arima I said sorry."  As he turned for the door, he added, "And tell… Mitzuki and Sachiko I said bye.  I saw them in the dinning room, but I didn't want to bother them."  
"谢谢…" 真嗣低声说，握住明日香的手。"告诉有马先生我道歉了。" 当他转身向门口走去时，他又补充道，"还有，告诉… 光子和幸子我告别了。我在餐厅看到她们，但不想打扰她们。"

"You're the best damn dishwasher I've ever had," Alexander said with a sigh.  
"你是我用过的最好的洗碗工，" 亚历山大叹息道。"

"I am?" Shinji replied, his voice filled with wonder.  
"我吗？" 真嗣回答，声音中充满了惊奇。

"Actually," the man answered, "no.  But you were pretty good."  They looked at each other for a moment, then broke into laughter.  "Honestly, though," the cook said, sobering slightly and offering the younger man his hand, "it was a pleasure to work with you.  I hope things turn out well for you, Shinji."  
"实际上，" 那人回答，"不。但你表现得相当不错。" 他们彼此对视了一会儿，然后爆发出笑声。"不过说真的，" 厨师稍微严肃了些，向年轻人伸出手，"和你一起工作很愉快。我希望你一切顺利，真嗣。"

The former Third Child smiled, taking the offered hand.  "Thank you, Mister Davies," he said softly, "I hope things turn out well for you, too."  
前第三适格者微笑着，握住了伸出的手。"谢谢你，戴维斯先生，" 他轻声说，"我也希望你一切顺利。"

"You can call me Alex now."  
"你现在可以叫我亚历克斯。"

Shinji's smile grew slightly, and he nodded.  "Alright, Alex."  He reclaimed his hand, taking a deep breath.  "Well," he said awkwardly, "I guess we should get going.  Take care."  
真嗣的微笑微微加深，他点了点头。“好的，亚历克斯。”他收回手，深吸了一口气。“嗯，”他尴尬地说，“我想我们该走了。保重。”

"You too, Shinji," Alexander replied, shifting his smile to Asuka and inclining his head slightly, "and you."  
“你也是，真嗣，”亚历山大回答道，将微笑转向明日香并微微点头，“还有你。”

"Thank you," Asuka answered, returning his nod and turning for the door.  
"谢谢你，" 明日香回答道，回以点头并转身向门口走去。

"Hey Shinji?" “嘿，真嗣？”

As Asuka stepped out of the room, Shinji paused, turning back to face the cook.  "Yeah?"  
当明日香走出房间时，真嗣停顿了一下，转身面向厨师。"嗯？"

"I'm glad you weren't that side."  
"我很高兴你不是在那一边。"

Shinji considered this for a moment before nodding slowly and turning away once more.  "Yeah, me too."  
真嗣思索片刻，缓缓点头，再次转过身去。“嗯，我也是。”

Stepping out of the kitchen, the couple nearly ran into Mitzuki.  "I'm glad I caught you," she murmured awkwardly, "I… wanted to give you this."  
夫妇俩走出厨房，差点撞上光月。“很高兴我赶上了，”她尴尬地低声说，“我……想把这个给你。”

Shinji blushed, avoiding her eyes.  "You don't have to give-"  
真嗣脸红，避开她的目光。“你不必给——”

He broke off as the young woman slowly reached up and pulled the bandana off her head, holding it out to him.  "Will you take this?" she asked quietly, "And think of me sometimes…?"  
他话音未落，年轻女子缓缓伸手，将头上的头巾摘下，递给他。“你能收下这个吗？”她轻声问道，“并偶尔想起我……？”

Shinji swallowed, looking around at the assorted people in the restaurant.  I wish, he thought, looking down at the floor between them, that I could ever be that strong.  
真嗣咽了咽口水，环顾餐厅里形形色色的人。他低头看着两人之间的地面，心想，我多么希望能有那样的坚强。

Mitzuki smiled as Shinji reached out, his fingers grazing hers as he took the small cloth.  "Being with you was… nice," she whispered softly, flushing as she shifted her gaze to Asuka, easily picking out the white cross necklace Shinji always carried around with him.  "I hope you know how lucky you are."  
光月微笑着，看着真嗣伸出手，指尖轻触她的手指，接过那块小布。“与你在一起……很美好，”她柔声低语，脸颊泛红，目光转向明日香，轻易地认出了真嗣总是随身携带的白色十字架项链。“希望你知道自己有多幸运。”

Asuka nodded, looking away from the girl and absently caressing Misato's old pendant, the only remaining memento of her secretly-admired guardian.  "Come on, Shinji," she murmured, slipping her arm through his and starting for the door.  Taking a look back over her shoulder at the girl, she commented, "Her hair looks like Misato's."  
明日香点点头，避开女孩的目光，心不在焉地抚摸着美里旧项链，这是她暗自敬仰的守护者留下的唯一纪念品。“走吧，真嗣，”她低声说道，手臂穿过他的，向门口走去。回头瞥了一眼女孩，她评论道：“她的头发看起来像美里的。”

"Misato's was darker," Shinji said softly, trying to push past the memory of the disappointed look on the girl's face, and the knowledge that he had caused it – on purpose or not.  
“美里的更深一些，”真嗣轻声说，试图摆脱女孩脸上失望的表情和明知自己造成了这一结果的认知——无论有意与否。

"Not when she was younger," the redhead shrugged, "she showed me a picture of herself when she was about twenty – her hair was the same color as that girl's."  
“她年轻时不是这样的，”红发女孩耸耸肩，“她给我看过一张她二十岁左右的照片——她的头发和那女孩的颜色一样。”

The former Third Child froze, turning slowly to look back at the waitress as she took someone's order.  
曾经的第三适格者僵住了，缓缓转头看向那位女服务员，她正在接别人的点单。

"What's up?" Asuka asked, following his line of sight.  
“怎么了？”明日香问道，顺着他的视线望去。

Mitzuki glanced up, smiling and waving briefly before going back to her duties.  
光月抬头瞥了一眼，微笑着短暂挥了挥手，然后继续忙她的工作。

"Nothing," Shinji whispered softly, suddenly recalling the feel of his guardian's lips on his, moments before her death.  "Let's go."  
"没什么，" 真嗣轻声低语，突然回想起她的守护者在临死前那一刻，唇瓣触碰他的感觉。"我们走吧。"

"Do you have a minute before you leave?"  
"你离开前有时间吗？"

The two Children turned to find Sachiko standing in front of them.  Asuka unconsciously tightened her grip on Shinji's arm, glaring at the girl with unabashed anger.  With Mitzuki, she had known who the enemy was… but she had never seen Sachiko coming – nor had she been aware until the argument in the restaurant that there might be more than one opponent.  
两个孩子转身发现幸子站在他们面前。明日香下意识地抓紧了真嗣的手臂，毫不掩饰地怒视着幸子。与光月对峙时，她清楚谁是敌人……但她从未料到幸子的出现——直到在餐厅的那场争执，她才意识到可能不止一个对手。

In short, Mitzuki she disliked for beating her… Sachiko she disliked for being so quietly powerful.  She could sense the energy between the dark-haired girl and Shinji, and she did not like it.  
简而言之，她讨厌 Mitzuki 因为她打败了自己……她讨厌 Sachiko 因为她如此静默却强大。她能感觉到黑发女孩和 Shinji 之间的能量，她不喜欢这种感觉。

The waitress shifted slightly under the redhead's gaze, but kept her eyes on Shinji.  "I just want to say goodbye," she said warily, "we can sit at one of the tables if that would make it easier."  
女服务员在红发女孩的注视下略微挪动了一下，但她的目光始终停留在 Shinji 身上。“我只是想道个别，”她谨慎地说，“我们可以坐在一张桌子旁，这样可能会更方便。”

Shinji nodded, carefully extracting his arm from Asuka's.  "Will you wait here?" he asked gently, kissing the girl on the cheek and waiting for her to slowly nod, never looking away from her perceived rival.  
Shinji 点点头，小心翼翼地从 Asuka 身边抽出自己的手臂。“你能在这里等我吗？”他温柔地问道，亲吻了女孩的脸颊，等待她慢慢点头，目光始终未曾离开她眼中的对手。

Sachiko led him to one of the tables, making sure to stay in full view of the other girl and sitting on the opposite side from the now ex-employee of the restaurant.  As soon as they were situated, she let out a long breath.  "Shinji," she began slowly, staring down at the table, "Domiyoji proposed to me."  
幸子领着他来到一张桌子旁，确保自己始终在另一个女孩的视线范围内，并坐在了现在已是前员工的餐厅员工的对面。他们一坐定，她就长长地舒了一口气。“真嗣，”她缓缓开口，目光低垂着看着桌面，“道明寺向我求婚了。”

"That's great!" the brown-haired boy said enthusiastically, "Now you-"  
“那太好了！”棕发男孩热情地说，“现在你——”

"I had to say no."  
“我不得不拒绝了。”

"What?  Why!?  I don't… I don't understand."  
"什么？为什么！？我不……我不明白。"

The dark-haired girl met his eyes.  "Us," she said plainly, "I couldn't marry him without knowing for sure that I would always be faithful, and as far as we went together – even though we didn't go all the way – I don't know that."  
黑发女孩直视着他的眼睛。“我们，”她平静地说，“我不确定自己能否永远忠诚，所以不能嫁给他。尽管我们没有走到最后一步，但我还是不确定。”

"I'm sorry." "我很抱歉。"

"It's not your fault, Shinji… like I said in the alley; I don't know what exactly it is, whether it's you, or me, or just us – or whatever… I can't commit myself to him until I know for sure that I can be his alone."  
“这不是你的错，真嗣……就像我在小巷里说的；我不知道究竟是什么原因，是你，还是我，或者是我们之间的问题……在我确定能完全属于他之前，我无法向他承诺。”

"I'm still sorry," the boy replied quietly, glancing over at Asuka, who immediately looked away, pretending to take great interest in the décor, "even if it's not my fault, or yours, it's still not fair that you can't be with him."  
"我还是感到抱歉，"男孩轻声回答，目光瞥向明日香，她立刻转过头去，假装对装饰品产生了极大的兴趣，"即使这不是我的错，也不是你的错，你不能和他在一起仍然是不公平的。"

Sachiko shrugged uncomfortably, dropping her eyes to the table and fiddling with the paper napkin in front of her.  "It… might still work out," she said softly, "but I need to know, you know what I mean?  I can't promise to love him and then meet someone like you again, or bump into you at the wrong place in the wrong time and…"  She sighed, "You know what I'm trying to say, right?"  
幸子不自在地耸了耸肩，目光垂向桌面，摆弄着面前的纸巾。"也许……还有可能，"她轻声说，"但我需要知道，你懂我的意思吧？我不能承诺去爱他，然后又遇到像你这样的人，或者在错误的时间错误的地点撞见你……"她叹了口气，"你知道我想说什么，对吧？"

"Yeah," Shinji replied gently, "I do, Sachiko.  I hope you guys can work it out."  
"嗯，"真嗣温和地回应，"我懂，幸子。我希望你们能解决好。"

"Me too." “我也是。”

"I'm going to get going before Asuka gets upset, ok?"  
"我得走了，不然明日香会生气的，好吗？"

Sachiko nodded, rising to her feet with the boy and smiling gently.  "Think she'd mind if I gave you a hug?" she asked quietly.  
幸子点点头，站起身来，微笑着温柔地问：“你觉得她会介意我给你一个拥抱吗？”她轻声问道。

Blushing, Shinji nodded.  
真嗣脸红着点了点头。

The waitress sighed.  "Yeah," she continued, "kinda guessed that.  Well, I guess I'll just settle for this."  She extended her hand, taking Shinji's and shaking it slowly.  "Good luck," she whispered, "stop by and visit us sometimes, ok?"  
女服务员叹了口气。  "是啊，"她继续说道，"有点猜到了。好吧，我想我就接受这个吧。" 她伸出手，握住真嗣的手，缓缓摇了摇。  "祝你好运，"她低声说，"有空常来看看我们，好吗？"

"Yeah," the former Third Child said, averting his eyes, "I will."  
"嗯，"前第三适格者说，目光避开，"我会的。"

They both knew that he wouldn't, but neither wanted to admit it, so they let it go.  
他们俩都知道他不会来，但谁也不想承认，于是就让它过去了。

Sachiko watched as Shinji walked over to Asuka and took her hand, leading her out of the restaurant without once looking back.  Hearing footsteps behind her, she bowed her head, whispering, "I never tried to take him from you, Mitzu, you know that, don't you…?"  
幸子看着真嗣走向明日香，牵起她的手，头也不回地离开了餐厅。听到身后的脚步声，她低下头，轻声呢喃：“我从未试图从你身边夺走他，光，你知道的，对吧…？”

"Yeah," came the quiet reply, "I know you didn't."  There was a soft sigh, "And I don't think either of us ever had a chance – not unless she was out of the way."  
“嗯，”传来一声轻柔的回应，“我知道你没有。”一阵轻叹，“我想我们俩都没机会——除非她不在了。”

"Hmmm," the dark-haired girl hummed, smiling as she turned to face her friend, "you sound like you're going to put a hit out on her."  
“嗯哼，”黑发女孩哼了一声，微笑着转向朋友，“你听起来像是要雇人干掉她。”

Mitzuki grinned, dropping the other girl a wink.  "Come now, I would never stoop to something that messy," her smiled slowly faded as she looked towards the door, "but I do envy her."  
Mitzuki 咧嘴一笑，向另一个女孩眨了眨眼。“来吧，我可不会堕落到那种混乱的地步，”她微笑慢慢消失，目光转向门口，“但我确实羡慕她。”

For the first time in their relationship, Sachiko found herself unable to let the lie go.  "No you don't," she murmured, following the other girl's gaze, "You never loved him, Mitzu, you loved having someone like him."  
在她们的关系中，Sachiko 第一次发现自己无法放过这个谎言。“不，你不羡慕，”她低声说，顺着另一个女孩的目光，“Mitzu，你从未爱过他，你只是喜欢拥有像他这样的人。”

"What's that supposed to mean?"  
“那是什么意思？”

"What kind of food does he like?  What kind of music does he play in that SDAT?  What was the name of his guardian?"  
"他喜欢吃什么？他在那个 SDAT 里播放什么音乐？他的监护人叫什么名字？"

Mitzuki blushed, staring down at the floor.  
光月脸红了，低头盯着地板。

"It's ok," Sachiko said gently, finally laying her finger on what had been bothering her about her attraction to the boy, "we both wanted something from him – you wanted someone who would treat you kindly and tell you that you were a good person."  She sighed, "And I kinda wanted the same thing, I guess, but I wanted it without having to think about it – I just wanted to let my mind go and…" she trailed off as the other girl shook her head.  "What?"  
"没关系，" 幸子温柔地说道，终于明白了她对那个男孩的吸引中让她困扰的是什么，"我们都想从他那里得到些什么——你想要一个会善待你、告诉你是个好人的人。" 她叹了口气，"我想我也差不多，但我不想去思考这些——我只是想让我的思绪自由飘荡，然后……" 她话没说完，因为另一个女孩摇了摇头。"什么？"

"Maybe you're right about me," Mitzuki said quietly, "but I know what you wanted, and it's not that shit you're spouting."  
"也许你对我看法没错，" 光希轻声说，"但我知道你真正想要的，绝不是你说的那些废话。"

"And what might that be, Miss Psychic?"  
"那会是什么呢，心灵感应小姐？"

"You wanted an out." Mitzuki whispered, "You don't love Domiyoji… if you did, you never would have invited Shinji into your house."  
"你想要的是解脱。" 光希低语，"你不爱道明寺… 如果你爱他，绝不会让真治踏进你的家门。"

"That's not true, I-"  
"那不是真的，我-"

"Look me in the eyes… and tell me you'll marry him."  
"看着我的眼睛…告诉我你会嫁给他。"

There was a moment of silence, then Sachiko turned away.  "You don't know anything," she muttered.  
沉默片刻后，幸子转过身去。  “你什么都不知道，”她低声说。

Mitzuki smiled, but it was hollow and flat.  "I'm going to get back to work," she said calmly, turning to head towards the back of the restaurant, "see ya."  
光月笑了，但那笑容空洞而平淡。“我要回去工作了，”她平静地说着，转身向餐厅后方走去，“再见。”

"Hey Mitzu." “嘿，光月。”

"Yeah?" "嗯？"

"I like your hair that way."  
“我喜欢你这样子的发型。”

It was an honest compliment, given sincerely, and accepted without question or doubt… but from that moment on, Mitzuki and Sachiko never quite considered themselves friends.  
这是一句真诚的赞美，发自内心，毫无保留地被接受……但从那一刻起，光月和幸子再也没有真正视彼此为朋友。

"Thanks." "谢谢。"

Quietly, the two returned to work, each wondering if the other had been right, and each knowing that, for better or worse, Shinji Ikari had changed their lives.  
两人默默地回到工作岗位，各自思索对方是否正确，也各自明白，无论是好是坏，碇真嗣已经改变了他们的生活。

As for the Golden Temple, it didn't seem to mind the passing of its latest dishwasher from within its confines.  Much like life, the restaurant simply was.  Not passing judgement… not taking sides… not caring if hearts were broken or love was lost.  It merely existed, waiting patiently for the next employee, or the next customer, or the next owner, never questioning its place.  
至于金阁寺，它似乎并不在意最近一位洗碗工的离去。就像生活本身，这家餐厅只是存在。不作评判……不偏不倚……不在乎心灵是否破碎或爱情是否失落。它只是静静地存在着，耐心等待下一位员工、下一位顾客或下一位主人，从不质疑自己的位置。

And so, the rest of the evening passed slowly, quietly, and uneventfully… though secretly, Mitzuki and Sachiko felt that it passed with just a touch more sadness than the previous night…  
于是，那个晚上就这样缓缓地、静悄悄地、平淡无奇地过去了……尽管在心底，光月和幸子觉得它比前一晚多了那么一丝哀伤……

The End 完结

Author's notes:  on the epilogue, and Sachiko in particular.  Hey, what can I say… not everyone gets a happy-happy ending, you know?  I was going to have Sachiko announcing her engagement, but it felt false to me.  After what happened, it didn't seem realistic to have everyone cheery and upbeat.  Infidelity – even with a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship – hurts, and it's not always easy (or possible) to regain a feeling of wellbeing and trust once it's lost, even if only one person knows something is amiss.   
作者的话：关于尾声，特别是幸子的部分。嘿，我又能说什么呢……不是每个人都能拥有幸福美满的结局，对吧？我原本打算让幸子宣布她的订婚消息，但那样对我来说显得太假了。经历了那些事情之后，让每个人都欢快和乐观似乎不太现实。不忠——即使是男女朋友关系中的——也会带来伤害，一旦失去了幸福感和信任，即使只有一个人察觉到不对劲，也不是总能（或可能）轻易恢复的。

I hope you liked this story… sure as hell took me long enough to write.  I start it as a short little time-waster to help my other stories along, and I had planned on only making it about 10 pages or so, focusing on Shinji's part-time job in post 3I Tokyo-2… but it sorta grew :P  It was started around April 07th, 2002, and completed on September 8th, 2003.  It's approximately 33,840 words long, comprising 84 pages, including all notes and disclaimers… case anyone cares.  ^_~  
希望你喜欢这个故事……确实花了我不少时间来写。我开始把它当作一个短小的消遣，帮助推进其他故事，原本计划只写大约 10 页，主要聚焦于真嗣在第三新东京市的兼职工作……但它有点失控了 :P 这个故事始于 2002 年 4 月 7 日，完成于 2003 年 9 月 8 日。全文约 33,840 字，共 84 页，包括所有注释和声明……如果有谁在意的话。^_~
