真相的冰冷愤怒憎恨

Disclaimer: _You_ know I don't known Evangelion. _I_ know I don't own Evangelion. _Gainax_ sure as hell knows I don't own Evangelion. So there, it's settled, I don't own Evangelion. Now let's more on to bigger things, shall we?  
声明：你知道我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。我知道我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。Gainax 当然也知道我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。所以，就这样，我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。现在让我们继续讨论更重要的事情，好吗？

She was probably the happiest little girl alive at that moment.  
那一刻，她可能是世界上最快乐的小女孩。

"Mama!" She cried. "Mama! They chose me!"  
"妈妈！" 她喊道，"妈妈！他们选中我了！"

She ran, faster and faster. "I'll be an elite pilot! I'll defend Mankind! I'll be the best in the world!"  
她跑得越来越快，心想：'我将成为精英飞行员！我将保卫人类！我将成为世界最佳！'

The door opened… 门开了……

"I have to keep it a secret," she cried. "So I'll only tell you!"  
"我必须保守这个秘密，"她哭着说，"所以只告诉你一个人！"

The door opened… 门开了……

"Everyone is being so nice to me now!" she exclaimed. "I won't have to be so lonely anymore!"  
"现在大家都对我这么好！"她兴奋地说，"我再也不用那么孤单了！"

The door opened… 门开了…

"I'm ok now!" she screamed. "Even without Papa!"  
我现在没事了！"她尖叫道，"即使没有爸爸！

The door opened… 门开了…

"So look!" she was crying at the top of her lungs. "Look at me!"  
"看啊！" 她声嘶力竭地哭喊着，"看看我！"

The door opened… 门开了……

"Mama!" was her last word, before the gruesome sight greeted her eyes. Hanging by her neck was her mother. Dead, gone, killed by the rage of her madness. It was then that Asuka Langly Soryu received her eternal scar, one she would wear with her the rest of her life…  
"妈妈！" 这是她最后的话语，紧接着，那恐怖的景象映入眼帘。她的母亲，被吊在脖子上，已经死去，消失，被她疯狂的怒火所杀。那一刻，惣流·明日香·兰格雷背负上了永恒的伤痕，她将带着这道伤痕度过余生……

"Did you hear me, Asuka?" asked Misato from the operations panel. "Are you alright?"  
"你听到我说话了吗，明日香？" 美里从操作面板那边问道，"你还好吗？"

Asuka opened her eyes. The image had been fresh in her mind since that day. And it had been getting worse. Every time she had spoke to anyone, her mind raced to find the right words to say, so that they would get the message that she didn't want to be touched. Not by anyone. For the last time someone had touched her…the last time she had gotten close to some one…she had left her.  
明日香睁开眼睛。自从那天起，那个画面就一直清晰地留在她的脑海中，而且越来越严重。每当她和任何人交谈时，她的思绪就会飞速寻找合适的词语，以传达她不想被触碰的信息。不想被任何人触碰。因为上一次有人触碰她……上一次她与某人亲近……她离开了她。

"Yeah, Misato," she said. "I'm fine."  
"嗯，美里，" 她说，"我没事。"

Rei observed the uncommonly silent second child they both proceeded to dress. Rei was unsure of how to interpret Asuka's recent behavior. Normally she would talk on about every insignificant thing. But now, she had become so silent, that Rei actually felt the need to press the issue.  
绫波观察着异常沉默的第二个孩子，两人随后开始更衣。绫波不确定该如何解读明日香近来的行为。平日里她总是喋喋不休，谈论每一件微不足道的事情。但现在，她变得如此沉默，以至于绫波真的觉得有必要探究这个问题。

"When there is something troubling you," Rei said. "It is best to let it out sooner rather than later."  
当有事情困扰你时，"绫波说，"最好尽早说出来，而不是拖延。

Asuka turned sharply. "What's that supposed to mean?"  
明日香猛地转过身。"你这话是什么意思？

Rei did not change her pace of dress by a single second. "There is something troubling you, is there not?"  
绫波没有改变她穿衣的速度，哪怕是一秒。“你有什么烦心事，不是吗？”

Asuka glared. "It's none of your business, First Child!"  
明日香瞪了一眼。“这与你无关，第一适格者！”

Rei sighed. "Then, I shall let the matter rest, only to let it grow until it consumes you, Soryu. Be mindful of your feelings, whatever they may be. For I sense a great danger in their continued procedure."  
绫波叹了口气。“那么，我将不再过问此事，任其发展直至吞噬你，惣流。注意你的感受，无论它们是什么。因为我感觉到它们继续发展下去会有极大的危险。”

Asuka shook. "Sh…shut up! You just shut up!"  
明日香颤抖着。“闭…闭嘴！你给我闭嘴！”

Rei opened the door. "Goodbye." With that, she left her in the locker room.  
绫波打开了门。“再见。”说完，她便离开了更衣室。

Asuka sat down on the bench like her body weighed a thousand pounds. She began to cry, weeping in solitude.  
明日香沉重地坐在长凳上，仿佛身体有千斤重。她开始哭泣，独自一人泪流满面。

Wiping her face, stood. "I can't let anyone see me like this. If they do…they'll only see me as a weak child. I…I've got to be better than that."  
擦了擦脸，站起身来。‘我不能让任何人看到我这副模样。如果他们看到了……他们只会把我看作一个软弱的孩子。我……我必须比那更坚强。’

She stood up and finished dressing, and left.  
她站起来穿好衣服，然后离开了。

Shinji silently cooked dinner. Misato slouched in her room. The faint sound of the answering machine droning over and over could be heard to the pricked ear. Asuka sat at the table, staring down at her lap, with her fingers laced together.  
真嗣默默地做着晚饭。美里懒洋洋地躺在她的房间里。细心的耳朵能听到答录机一遍又一遍地播放着微弱的声音。明日香坐在桌旁，低头看着自己的膝盖，手指交缠在一起。

Shinji set plates on the table and served the steaming food. After pouring water for the both of them, he sat down.  
真嗣将盘子摆在桌上，端上了热气腾腾的食物。倒好两人的水后，他坐了下来。

"_Itadakemas_," he muttered, before taking meek little bites of food.  
他低声说了句“我开动了”，然后小心翼翼地小口吃起食物。

He had taken no more than four bites when Asuka simply burst.  
他还没吃超过四口，明日香就突然爆发了。

"Why do you have to be so calm about things!" she yelled.  
"为什么你总能这么冷静！" 她吼道。

Shinji looked up at her. "What?"  
真嗣抬头看着她。"什么？"

"How do you do it, Shinji?" she demanded. "How do you play the meek obedient role at home, but at work, you do so well? How do you do it?"  
"你是怎么做到的，真嗣？" 她质问道，"你怎么能在家扮演温顺听话的角色，而在工作中却表现得如此出色？你是怎么做到的？"

Shinji stammered and looked around the room. "I…I, um…"  
真嗣结结巴巴地环顾房间。“我…我，嗯…”

Asuka glared. "Well?" 明日香瞪眼道：“然后呢？”

Shinji slouched low. "Cause…it's all I have to do. Maybe…if I give up caring about every little thing, than it won't hurt so much."  
真嗣垂头丧气地说：“因为…这是我唯一能做的。或许…如果我不再在乎每一件小事，那么就不会那么痛苦了。”

Asuka tilted her head back. "That makes no sense."  
明日香仰起头。“这说不通。”

Shinji shrugged. "I don't know what else to say."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我不知道还能说什么。”

Asuka sighed and left the table. "Why do I even bother?"  
明日香叹了口气，离开了桌子。“我何必自找麻烦？”

Shinji sat up. "You're leaving? What about your dinner?"  
真嗣坐了起来。“你要走了？那你的晚饭怎么办？”

"I don't want it!" Asuka said, before shutting the door.  
“我不要了！”明日香说完，砰地一声关上了门。

"Unit 02's signals all read normal," said the animatronic voice of the technician staff of NERV.  
“二号机的信号全部显示正常，”NERV 技术人员的机械声音报告道。

"Connection and fusion of EVA's are within normal limit," said another, female this time. "The field of proliferation is within expected limits."  
"EVA 之间的连接与融合处于正常范围内，"另一位女性说道，"增殖领域也在预期范围内。"

Asuka stood before her EVA, in a mock stance of dominance. "You're just my doll, so move like I tell you to, and don't argue."  
明日香站在她的 EVA 前，摆出一副模拟的支配姿态。"你只是我的玩偶，所以按照我说的行动，不要顶嘴。"

The EVA had no immediate response. Maybe it just wanted to think that remark over a bit.  
EVA 没有立即回应。也许它只是想稍微思考一下那句话。

"Why does a weapon need a mind?" Asuka asked. "It just gives you trouble."  
"为什么武器需要有意识？" 明日香问道，"那只会给你添麻烦。"

Again, the EVA was silent.  
又一次，EVA 保持沉默。

"Anyway, you must obey my orders," Asuka said.  
"总之，你必须服从我的命令，" 明日香说。

Again, silence. 又一次，寂静。

Asuka perked her eyes. "This is stupid."  
明日香瞪大了眼睛。“这太蠢了。”

That's when the alarm sounded. "All personnel go to first stage alert. Prepare for aerial assault."  
就在那时，警报响起。“所有人员进入一级警戒状态。准备应对空袭。”

Asuka reared back. "An Angel? They're still coming?"  
明日香往后一仰。“天使？它们还在来？”

xxxxx

"Visual confirmation of the angel," said one of the technicians. The image on the screen went to maximum magnification, revealing a white winged creature in outer space.  
“天使的视觉确认，”一名技术人员说道。屏幕上的图像放大到最大，显示出外太空一个白色带翼的生物。

As Hyuga studied his control panel, he spoke out his role. "It hasn't moved from orbit."  
日向审视着控制面板，报告道：“它没有离开轨道。”

Shigeru did the same. "It's maintaining a constant distance from our position."  
Shigeru 也做了同样的事。“它正与我们保持恒定的距离。”

Misato stood tall, contemplating the situation. "So, does that mean it's looking for a place to land?" she asked. "Or is it going to destroy us from up there?"  
Misato 站得笔直，沉思着局势。“那么，这是否意味着它在寻找着陆点？”她问道。“还是它打算从上面摧毁我们？”

Hyuga turned to her. "We can't attack it easily from this position."  
Hyuga 转向她。“从这个位置我们很难轻易攻击它。”

Misato nodded. "Unless it comes within out range, there's nothing we can do about it. The EVA's can't destroy an enemy that's in orbit."  
碇点点头。“除非它进入我们的射程，否则我们无能为力。EVA 无法摧毁轨道上的敌人。”

Turning to Maya, Misato asked, "What's Rei's situation?"  
转向玛雅，碇问道：“绫波的情况怎么样？”

"She and unit 00 are in good condition," she reported.  
“她和零号机状况良好，”她报告道。

"Understood," Misato said. "Sortie Unit 00. Prepare for extreme long range firing. Unit 02, Asuka, be ready to sortie as her back up"  
"明白，" 碇真嗣说道。"零号机，准备进行超远程射击。二号机，明日香，做好出击准备，作为她的后备支援。

The words hit her like daggers. _Be ready to sortie as her back up_. Like hell she would.  
这些话像匕首一样刺痛了她。做好出击准备，作为她的后备支援。她才不会甘心。

"Back up?" Asuka demanded. "Me? For unit 00?"  
"后备支援？" 明日香质问道。"我？给零号机做后备？"

"That's right," said Misato. "Take the rear guard position."  
"没错，" 碇真嗣说道，"你负责后卫位置。"

"You can't be serious!" Asuka yelled. "EVA unit 02 launch!"  
"你不是认真的吧！" 明日香大喊，"二号机，发射！"

Unit 02 went springing into the city.  
二号机一跃而起，冲进了城市。

"Asuka!" yelled Ritsuko exclaimed.  
"明日香！" 律子惊呼道。

"It's ok," Misato said. "Let her take the point if that's what she wants."  
"没关系，" 美里说，"如果她想带头，就让她去吧。"

Hyuga was taken aghast. "Major Katsuragi?!"  
日向惊呆了。"葛城少校？！"

Ritsuko looked stern. "If she fails this time, she won't be allowed to pilot any more."  
律子表情严肃。“如果这次她失败了，她将不再被允许驾驶任何机体。”

Maya turned around. "You mean this is her last chance?"  
玛雅转过身来。“你的意思是，这是她最后的机会了？”

Ritsuko leaned closer to her. "We'd better start making preparations to replace unit 02's pilot, just in case."  
律子向她靠近了一些。“我们最好开始准备替换 02 号机体的驾驶员，以防万一。”

Maya sighed and turned back to her station. "Yes, ma'am."  
玛雅叹了口气，转身回到她的工作站。“是的，女士。”

Hyuga turned to Misato. "Excuse me, but aren't we going to sortie unit 01?"  
日向转向美里。“打扰一下，我们不是要出动 01 号机吗？”

Misato shook her head. "The commander just let it out of cold freeze. His orders are to keep it hear until we have no other choice."  
美里摇了摇头。“指挥官刚让它解除冷冻。他的命令是将其留在这里，直到我们别无选择。”

Hyuga nodded. "Yes ma'am. But, just in case…?"  
日向点头道：“是的，女士。但是，以防万一……？”

Misato nodded. "Prepare to sortie unit 01. Be ready Shinji. We don't know when we'll need you."  
美里点头说：“准备出动 01 号机。真嗣，做好准备，我们不知道何时会需要你。”

Unit 02 stood in the rain, waiting for her weapon to come up. A rather unnecessary warning alarm sounded, and a NERV positron rifle glided up, nose to the sky.  
02 号机站在雨中，等待着她的武器送达。一个相当多余的警告警报响起，随后，NERV 的正电子步枪缓缓升起，枪口朝天。

Gripping the gun, Asuka kept her stern face. "If I fail this time, they won't let me pilot again. You can't make any mistake this time, Asuka."  
紧握着枪，明日香保持着严肃的面容。“如果这次失败了，他们不会再让我驾驶了。这次，你绝对不能出任何差错，明日香。”

As Asuka targeted, she was getting more and more frustrated.  
随着明日香瞄准目标，她的挫败感越来越强烈。

"Target is still out of range," the computer voice said.  
“目标仍未进入射程，”电脑声音说道。

"Why the hell are you so slow?" Asuka demanded. "Come on down, you lazy angel!"  
"你到底为什么这么慢？" 明日香质问道，"快点下来，你这懒惰的天使！"

Suddenly, her facial expression changed. A brilliant glare of ethereal light struck her suddenly. The light didn't bother her, though. But her mind…her mind…  
突然，她的表情变了。一道耀眼的天光突然照在她身上。光线并未让她感到不适，但她的思绪……她的思绪……

Waning lights flashed underground as NERV sensors lit up to this new weapon.  
随着 NERV 的传感器对这件新武器作出反应，地下的灯光闪烁不定。

"The Angel has a particle beam?" Misato demanded.  
"天使有粒子束？" 碇真嗣质疑道。

Hyuga racked through the sensors. "No. There are no thermal emissions detected."  
日向检索着传感器数据。"不，没有检测到热辐射。"

Maya suddenly found some disturbing information. "We've got abnormal readings in her synch-graph. Mental contamination is on the verge of occurring!"  
伊吹玛雅突然发现了一些令人不安的信息。"她的同步图谱出现了异常读数。精神污染即将发生！"

Ritsuko gasped as the saw what Maya saw. "The Angel is attempting a psychic attack? The Angels don't understand our minds that well!  
"律子倒吸一口凉气，看到了真嗣所见。“使徒在尝试精神攻击？使徒对我们的思维了解得并不深！”

Asuka clenched her eyes in pain. "God…damn!"  
明日香痛苦地紧闭双眼。“该死……”

She let loose two rounds of positron blasts, both of them missing its target by a mile.  
她连续发射了两轮阳电子炮，却都以毫厘之差未能命中目标。

"Positrons dissipating!" a technician said.  
"正电子正在消散！" 一位技术员说道。

"It's not working!" cried Shigeru. "The target is too far out of range!"  
"它不起作用！" 柴格鲁喊道，"目标太远超出范围了！"

Out of desperation, Asuka fired, again and again, until the shots started impacting on the city itself. She fired and fired, until her trigger wouldn't do anything other than click.  
出于绝望，明日香一次又一次地开火，直到子弹开始击中城市本身。她不停地射击，直到扳机除了发出咔哒声外，再无其他反应。

"Unit 02 has run out of ammunition!" cried Shigeru.  
"二号机弹药耗尽了！" 志村喊道。

Leaning over Hyuga's shoulder, Misato glared over. "What's the result of the beam analysis?"  
米莎托俯身在日向的肩上，目光锐利地问道："光束分析的结果是什么？"

Staring at Casper's mainframe, Hyuga answered, "It's an energy oscillation pattern on a visible wavelength! It's similar to an AT field, but we don't know much more!"  
日向盯着卡斯帕的主机，回答说："这是一种可见波长的能量振荡模式！类似于 AT 力场，但我们了解得并不多！"

"How's Asuka?" asked a concerned Ritsuko.  
"明日香怎么样了？" 里津子关切地问道。

"Her situation is critical! The mental contamination is crossing her Ego Borderline!"  
"她的状况很危急！精神污染正在突破她的自我边界！"

Asuka reeled. "NO! Don't come into me!  
明日香感到一阵眩晕。"不！别进来！

Pain

Clutching her head, Asuka was on the verge of being crushed.  
紧抱着头，明日香濒临崩溃的边缘。

Hatred 憎恨

All these emotions were suddenly filling her head  
这些情感突然间充斥了她的脑海

Menstruation 月经

Shame

Double Suicide 双双殉情

Invader 入侵者

Conformable 顺应的

Without meaning or pattern, emotions simply flooded her mind without the slightest bit of mercy.  
没有意义，没有模式，情感只是无情地涌入她的脑海。

"Get out of my mind!" Asuka screamed. "Please! Don't rape my mind!"  
“从我的脑海中滚出去！”明日香尖叫道。“求你了！不要侵犯我的思想！”

"Asuka!" Misato screamed. "That's it! I'm sending Rei up!"  
"明日香！" 美里尖叫道。"就这样！我要派绫波上去！"

"No," said the commander, quite calmly.  
"不，"指挥官平静地说。

"Sir!" Misato shouted. "I insist we do something about this!"  
"长官！" 美里喊道。"我坚持我们必须对此采取行动！"

The commander smiled. "Rei has gone down to get the lance of Longinus. Send unit 01 up with Shinji."  
指挥官微笑着说：“绫波已经下去取朗基努斯之枪了。让零号机带着真嗣上去。”

Misato hesitated for a moment, before hitting the panel. "Shinji, just get her out. Avoid being hit by the beam, but your primary objective is getting her to the escape hatch. Rei will be up in a minute to finish the job."  
美里犹豫了一下，然后按下了控制面板。“真嗣，只要把她救出来就行。避免被光束击中，但你的首要任务是把她带到逃生舱口。绫波马上就会上来完成剩下的任务。”

Unit 01 immediately after launched itself up. As soon as it got out, Shinji bolted as fast as his EVA could.  
零号机随即迅速升空。一出来，真嗣就以他的 EVA 能达到的最快速度冲刺。

"I've got to be quick about this," he said to himself. "Otherwise I might get caught too."  
"我得快点行动，" 他自言自语道，"否则我也可能被抓到。"

Had Shinji been allowed to hear what the people on the command deck heard, he'd be running for an entirely different reason.  
如果真嗣能听到指挥舱里人们的对话，他逃跑的理由将会完全不同。

What met Shinji's eyes, at first, didn't even appear to be unit 02. Its shape was so disoriented from spasming that it was hardly recognizable.  
最初映入真嗣眼帘的，甚至都不像是二号机。由于剧烈的抽搐，它的形状变得如此扭曲，几乎难以辨认。

Shinji stopped for but a second, before running full gallop, diving into Asuka and taking her out of the beam.  
真嗣停顿了仅仅一秒，随即全速奔跑，扑向明日香，将她从光束中救出。

Shinji would have gone for the escape hatch, when he saw unit 00, carrying what looked like a cross between a corkscrew and a spear.  
真嗣本想冲向逃生舱，却看见 0 号机携带着一个看起来像是开瓶器与长矛结合体的武器。

"What…what is that thing?" Shinji asked no one.  
“那…那是什么东西？”真嗣自言自语道。

Rei counted down the seconds before beginning her pace. With three, four, five steps, she launched the lance, splitting the sky, and lancing the angel like tissue paper.  
绫波开始倒数，随后迈开步伐。三步、四步、五步，她投出长枪，划破天际，如穿薄纸般刺穿了使徒。

"Wow," Shinji commented. "What was that thing?"  
“哇，”真嗣惊叹道，“那是什么东西？”

That's when the squirming mass in his arms began to move.  
就在这时，他怀中蠕动的一团开始动了起来。

"Asuka?" he asked. "明日香？" 他问道。

Without even answering, she made it to her EVA's feet. Her stare met with Rei's. Asuka's eyes suddenly crooked downward. "You…"  
她甚至没有回答，就跑到了她的 EVA 脚下。她的目光与绫波相遇。明日香的眼睛突然向下弯曲。"你……"

Before anyone could react, Asuka was hurling herself at Rei.  
在任何人能反应之前，明日香已经向绫波扑去。

Rei did not so much as move, for right before Asuka would have reached her, she disappeared down an escape hatch.  
绫波丝毫未动，就在明日香即将触碰到她之际，她消失在了逃生舱口之下。

Asuka pounded against the hatch. "Come back here, you bitch!"  
明日香猛击舱口，怒吼道：“你这贱人，给我回来！”

The look on Asuka's face was bloodthirsty. Anyone looking at her would instantly assume she was mad. Not angry mad, but insanely mad. Her eyes were bloodthirsty; her face was riddled with sweat.  
明日香脸上的表情凶狠至极，任何人看到她都会立刻认为她疯了。不是普通的愤怒，而是疯狂至极。她的眼神充满杀意，脸上满是汗水。

"Damn you!" she shouted. "Why! Why do you have to shove it in my face like that!?"  
"该死的！"她喊道，"为什么！为什么你非要这样当面羞辱我！？"

"Asuka!" Shinji cried, taking her EVA's hand. "We have to go back. I was sent up here to get you down."  
"明日香！"真嗣喊着，握住了她的 EVA 的手，"我们必须回去。我被派上来就是为了带你下去。"

Shinji was suddenly met with a punch in his EVA's face.  
真嗣的 EVA 突然被一拳击中了脸部。

"And you!" Asuka shouted. "I can't believe you! I hate you!!"  
"而你！" 明日香喊道。"我真不敢相信你！我讨厌你！！"

Shinji rubbed his jaw. "Asuka…why'd you do that? I just saved you."  
真嗣揉了揉下巴。"明日香……你为什么这么做？我刚刚救了你。"

Asuka began to quake. "That's what I CAN'T STAND!"  
明日香开始颤抖。"这正是我无法忍受的！"

She punched him again, in the gut. Unit 01 reeled back, clutching his stomach.  
她再次朝他腹部猛击。初号机踉跄后退，捂着肚子。

"Asuka, stop," he said. "Please, don't do this."  
“明日香，住手，”他说，“求你，别这样。”

Asuka flung herself at him. "Damn you!"  
明日香扑向他，“该死的！”

She punched him in the face, sending his EVA toppling over.  
她一拳打在他的脸上，使他的 EVA 翻倒在地。

By now, the people in the control center were beside themselves with surprise. "Asuka, what are you doing? You're assaulting your own comrade!"  
此时，指挥中心的人们惊愕至极。“明日香，你在做什么？你正在攻击自己的战友！”

When they got no response, the order was given to cut her power source.  
在没有得到回应后，下达了切断她电源的命令。

The plug fell to the ground. Asuka turned back to the plug and said, "Oh, no you don't!"  
插头掉到了地上。明日香转回身对着插头说道：“哦，没门儿！”

She grabbed the plug and stuck in her EVA's back so hard, that it crippled into place.  
她一把抓住插头，用力插入她的 EVA 背部，以至于它牢牢地卡在了那里。

"External power source has been reinstated. The plug is jammed in. We can't cut it."  
外部电源已重新接通。插头卡住了。我们无法切断它。

Misato slammed her fist to the panel. "Damn it, Asuka! Stop acting like a child!"  
碇真嗣紧握着操纵杆，汗水顺着他的额头滑落。他深吸一口气，试图平复内心的紧张。

No response. 周围一片寂静，只有 EVA 机体的运转声在耳边回响。

"Is there any other way to cut her power?" Misato demanded.  
明日香的声音突然在通讯器中响起，带着一丝焦急：“真嗣，你准备好了吗？我们没有太多时间了。”

"Negative," was the response from Hyuga. "The only other way would be to shut down the whole facility."  
"负面，"是日向的回答。"唯一其他的方法就是关闭整个设施。"

Misato glared at the screen. "Dammit…"  
葛城怒视着屏幕。"该死……"

Asuka lunged at unit 01 repeatedly. Shinji was doing the best he could to protect himself. His arms were fastened over his chest to minimize the damage. "Asuka, please stop!"  
明日香不断向 01 号机发起攻击。真嗣尽力保护自己，双臂紧抱胸前以减少伤害。"明日香，请停下来！"

Asuka glared. "Not this time, third child. This time, I get my way."  
明日香瞪了一眼。“这次不行，三号小子。这次得听我的。”

Shinji glared at her, as she punched him again. "Why are you doing this?!"  
真嗣瞪着她，又被她打了一拳。“你为什么要这么做？！”

Asuka exploded, kicking him to the ground. "Why?! You want to know why!? You don't do shit for yourself when we're at home! You're so self depreciating that it makes me want to barf."  
明日香气炸了，一脚把他踹倒在地。“为什么？！你想知道为什么？！我们在家里时你什么都不为自己做！你这么自贬，我都快吐了。”

"So that's why you're mad?" Shinji asked.  
"所以这就是你生气的原因？" 真嗣问道。

"But you know what gets me?" Asuka demanded, picking him up and slamming him against a building. "That despite it all, you still manage to beat me in EVA! How do you do it?! How could you do it to me!?"  
"但你知不知道什么让我最火大？" 明日香质问道，一把将他拎起，狠狠地撞向一栋建筑。"尽管如此，你还是能在 EVA 中打败我！你怎么做到的？！你怎么能这样对我！？"

Shinji shouted back. "You think I'm _trying_ to hurt you? Do you think that anything I do is with your worst interests in mind?"  
真嗣反驳道："你以为我是故意要伤害你吗？你认为我所做的一切都是出于对你最坏的考虑吗？"

Asuka shook herself. "It doesn't matter if you mean it or not. What matters to me is that it happened."  
明日香摇了摇头。“你是不是真心的不重要，对我来说重要的是它发生了。”

Asuka punched him again. When Shinji tried to block her, she broke his EVA's arm.  
明日香再次给了他一拳。当真嗣试图阻挡时，她打断了他的 EVA 的手臂。

"Agh!" Shinji screamed. Clutching his wrist, he glared. "Fine then, I'll stop being a good EVA pilot. Is that what you want?! You want to pretend that you're better than me in everything? The world doesn't work like that!"  
“啊！”真嗣尖叫着，紧握着手腕，怒目而视。“好吧，那我就不再当个好 EVA 驾驶员了。这就是你想要的吗？！你想在所有事情上都表现得比我强吗？世界不是这样的！”

Asuka began to cry. "I…I know that." Stepping back, she shook. Looking back up at him, her EVA's eyes opened. "And THAT'S WHY I CAN'T STAND IT!"  
明日香开始哭泣。“我…我知道。”她后退一步，身体颤抖。抬头看向他，她的 EVA 的眼睛睁开了。“而这就是我无法忍受的原因！”

She delivered a soaring punch that sent Shinji slamming into the far building. The force, the lack of power, and the cringing pain wasn't bad enough, but his EVA, at that moment, shut itself down.  
她发出一记高飞的拳击，将真嗣猛击到远处的建筑物上。力量，无力感，以及令人缩紧的痛苦还不够糟糕，但就在那一刻，他的 EVA 自行关闭了。

Shinji was still able to talk to Asuka. "Asuka, I'm begging you. Stop this…" Shinji stuttered, his body quivering in pain.  
真嗣仍然能够与明日香交谈。“明日香，我求你了。停止这一切…”真嗣结巴着，身体因痛苦而颤抖。

"Too late, third child," Asuka stepped towards him, menacingly. "I'm fed up with your ways. And your word isn't good enough."  
"太晚了，三弟，" 明日香向他逼近，气势汹汹。"我已经受够了你的那一套。你的话已经不顶用了。"

Shinji clutched his eyes. Thoughts went through his head. One of them being the repeated phrase, _I mustn't run away…I mustn't run away…_  
真嗣捂住眼睛。思绪在他脑海中翻涌，其中不断重复的一句话是：我不能逃避…我不能逃避…

But that's when he heard another voice in his head. _If your word isn't good enough, then maybe mine is…_  
但就在这时，他脑海中又响起另一个声音。如果你的话不够分量，那么或许我的可以…

It took a little while for Shinji to process just what went down just then. But then he came to a realization. "_Iie_!!"  
过了一会儿，真嗣才反应过来刚才发生了什么。但随后他恍然大悟，大喊道：“不！！”

Unit 01 came back to life.  
初号机复活了。

xxxxx

"Ma'am! Unit 01 has reactivated!" came the startled voice of Shigeru.  
“女士！初号机重新启动了！”传来盐仓惊愕的声音。

"What?" Misato cried. "On no power? Oh my god…" Patching a communication with unit 02, he screamed. "Asuka, get out of there!"  
"什么？" 美里惊呼道，"没有动力？天哪……" 他迅速与二号机建立通讯，大声喊道："明日香，快离开那里！"

Asuka glared. "Don't mess with me any more, Misato. I've had it with you."  
明日香怒目而视。"别再烦我了，美里。我已经受够了你。"

Misato's face was the epitome of worry. "Asuka, for your own sake, get out of there!"  
美里的脸上写满了担忧。"明日香，为了你自己，快离开那里！

Asuka ignored her and faced unit 01. "So, the brat finally decided to face me."  
明日香无视了她，面对着零号机。“看来，那小鬼终于决定面对我了。”

Unit 01 bent it's legs, its artificial kneecaps extending outward. With all the angelic strength it could muster, it leapt into the air, flipping over forwards, and landed right in front of Asuka.  
零号机弯曲其双腿，人造膝盖向外延伸。它竭尽天使般的力量，一跃而起，向前翻转，稳稳地落在明日香面前。

Before the girl could react, unit 01 was gone.  
女孩还未来得及反应，零号机已消失不见。

"What?!" she screamed, before a huge blow caught her from behind, sending her flying forward. "How'd he get behind me?!"  
"什么?!" 她尖叫道，紧接着一股巨大的冲击从背后袭来，将她向前抛飞。"他怎么跑到我后面去了?!"

Turning to face him, she was met with the image of unit 01 running at a demon like speed towards her.  
她转身面对他，映入眼帘的是 01 号机以恶魔般的速度向她冲来的景象。

Asuka moved to strike it, but he was gone in an instant. Unit 01 had moved aside, and struck her from the side.  
明日香试图攻击，但他瞬间消失了。01 号机已经闪到一旁，从侧面击中了她。

"How does he move like that?!" Asuka demanded.  
"他怎么能那样移动?!" 明日香质问道。

Misato was tense the whole time. However, it was about then that she just simply sat back in her chair.  
整个过程中，美里都很紧张。然而，就在那时，她只是简单地靠回了自己的椅子上。

"Ma'am?" asked Hyuga. "Is there nothing we can do?"  
"女士？" 日向问道，"我们真的无能为力吗？"

"Throughout her entire career," Misato began, "Asuka has never given Shinji any respect at his commendable abilities. I think it's time she understood the full capabilities of his berserker."  
"在她整个职业生涯中，" 碇真嗣开始说道，"明日香从未对真嗣的卓越能力给予过任何尊重。我认为是时候让她了解他狂战士能力的全部实力了。"

Maya, Hyuga and everyone on the bridge simply gasped at Misato. She just calmly sat back, her eyes closed and arms folded.  
伊吹、日向以及桥上的所有人都对碇真嗣的话感到震惊。她只是平静地靠回座位，闭上眼睛，双臂交叉。

Unit 01 struck Asuka hard in the chest. The blow sent Unit 02 flying backward, slamming into another building, and leaving a significant scar to the building.  
初号机猛击明日香的胸口。这一击让二号机向后飞去，重重地撞入另一栋建筑，给建筑留下了明显的伤痕。

Asuka cringed at the impact, and looked up with an insane glare on her face. Her face then showed a distinct amount of fear, as unit 01 simply charged her. Slamming into her, the berserker simply pushed her through the building, and into a second.  
明日香因撞击而畏缩，抬头时脸上带着疯狂的怒视。随后，她的脸上明显流露出恐惧，因为零号机正向她冲来。猛烈撞击后，狂暴的零号机将她推穿建筑，又撞入另一栋。

All the while, Shinji was screaming. "No! Stop! Stoppit! Stoppit!"  
与此同时，真嗣在尖叫：“不！停下！停下来！停下来！”

Unit 01 would not listen to him. It was her job to protect her pilot. And right then, Asuka was a threat to his life. But Shinji still screamed. "Stop, please! Please, don't do this! Don't hurt her! Don't kill her!"  
零号机对他的呼喊置若罔闻。保护驾驶员是她的职责。而那一刻，明日香对真嗣的生命构成了威胁。但真嗣依旧在呼喊：“停下来，求你了！求你，不要这么做！不要伤害她！不要杀了她！”

Asuka tried to fight back. Taking a swing with her fist, her arm met unit 01's grip. Squeezing her unit's arm, 01 broke it easily.  
明日香试图反抗。她挥拳出击，手臂却被初号机牢牢抓住。初号机用力一握，轻易地折断了她的机体手臂。

"Agh!" Asuka screamed. “啊！”明日香尖叫道。

The sound met Shinji's ear. "NOOOO!!"  
这声音传到了真嗣耳中。“不——！！”

Unit 01 grabbed 02's face. In a matter of seconds, it began to crumble in its grasp.  
初号机抓住了二号机的脸。短短几秒内，它就在其掌握中开始崩解。

Asuka clutched her face in pain. "Damn you…"  
明日香痛苦地捂住脸。“可恶……”

Unit 01 drew its progressive knife and slashed at her chest plate. It cut deeper and deeper, until the core of unit 02 was visible.  
初号机拔出高振动粒子刀，向她的胸甲砍去。刀刃越切越深，直至二号机的核心暴露无遗。

Shinji saw the core before his eyes. He felt the EVA pull back to stab her. He screamed.  
真嗣眼前出现了核心。他感觉到 EVA 向后拉扯，准备刺向她。他尖叫起来。

"NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!" “不——！！！！！！”

The knife flew at her, until it suddenly stopped, hovered inches above unit 02's core. Asuka was long since unconscious. Unit 01 stood still for a few moments, and then quietly shut down.  
刀刃向她飞去，却在即将触及二号机核心的瞬间突然停住，悬浮在离核心仅几英寸的地方。明日香早已失去意识。初号机静立片刻，随后悄然关闭了系统。

A few minutes later, teams were sent up to get them back down to the Geo-Front. Unit 01's hatch opened. Misato was the one to look inside to see Shinji. He was curled up in a ball.  
几分钟后，队伍被派上去将他们带回 Geo-Front。Unit 01 的舱门打开了。美里探头进去看真嗣。他蜷缩成一团。

"Hey, Shinji?" Misato called, trying to be cheerful.  
“嘿，真嗣？”美里试图用欢快的语气呼唤。

He didn't answer. Misato looked suspicious and approached the boy. When she got close enough to his face, she heard him.  
他没有回应。美里显得有些怀疑，走近了男孩。当她足够靠近他的脸时，她听到了他的声音。

"What? What are you saying? I can't make it out?" she leaned in closer.  
"什么？你在说什么？我听不清楚。" 她凑得更近了。

"…Don't kill her, don't kill her, don't kill her, don't kill her, don't kill her…"  
"…别杀她，别杀她，别杀她，别杀她，别杀她…"

xxxxx

Things were pretty brutal after that. Asuka was placed in a holding cell for the longest time. It was maybe two weeks later when Misato stepped in.  
之后的情况相当残酷。明日香被关在拘留室里很久，大概两周后，美里才介入。

"What are you doing here?" Asuka demanded.  
"你在这里做什么？" 明日香质问道。

"Don't give me that, Asuka. You know damn well why I'm here," Misato said.  
"别跟我来这套，明日香。你明明知道我为什么来这里，" 美里说。

"If you want me to apologize, than you're wasting your time," Asuka shot back.  
"如果你想让我道歉，那你就是在浪费时间，" 明日香反击道。

"An apology wouldn't hurt, but I'm not the one who you should be apologizing to," Misato said.  
"道歉不会有什么损失，但你应该道歉的对象不是我，" 美里说道。

Asuka glared at her. "You want me to give some sympathy to that wimp?"  
明日香瞪着她。"你想让我同情那个懦夫吗？"

Misato glared back. "'That wimp' nearly killed you, Asuka. I'm not saying he should have, but you have no right to call him that. Not after what's happened."  
美里回瞪过去。"那个'懦夫'差点杀了你，明日香。我不是说他应该这么做，但你在经历了那些事情之后，没有权利这样称呼他。

"Fine," Asuka said. "It doesn't make a difference. I bet he's at home right now, sulking. Besides…" Asuka said, remembering the Angel's invasion. "I've got more important things to be worrying about."  
"好吧，"明日香说，"这没什么区别。我打赌他现在肯定在家生闷气。再说……"明日香想起了使徒的入侵，"我还有更重要的事情要操心。"

_Ouch_, Misato thought. _He really_ is _at home, sulking._ "I'll tell you one thing, though."  
哎呀，美里心想。他真的在家生闷气呢。"不过，我得告诉你一件事。"

Asuka looked up. "Hm?" 明日香抬起头。"嗯？"

"You're not going to be punished," Misato said.  
"你不会受到惩罚的，" 葛城美里说道。

"Huh? Why?" Asuka said, not expecting that.  
"啊？为什么？" 明日香惊讶地说，没想到会这样。

"Shinji wouldn't allow it," Misato put it, simply.  
"真嗣不会允许的，" 葛城美里简单地回答。

"What? Why not?" Asuka asked. "I would think that he'd be the first person to want me in trouble."  
"什么？为什么？" 明日香问道。"我以为他会是第一个希望我陷入麻烦的人。"

"The commander was about to have you kicked out of NERV, send you back to Germany, cut all ties, and possibly ruin your life. But Shinji…he just…wouldn't allow it."  
"指挥官正准备将你赶出 NERV，送你回德国，切断所有联系，甚至可能毁掉你的生活。但真嗣……他就是……不允许这样做。"

Asuka cringed. "I…I can't believe…that little _sweinhund_! I even need his protection to save my career!"  
明日香皱了皱眉。"我……我真不敢相信……那个小混蛋！我甚至需要他的保护来挽救我的职业生涯！"

Misato shouted back at her. "That's because you're acting like a little kid! Do you realize what you did? You assaulted one of your own comrades on the battlefield. In any country, that's grounds for insubordination, and punishable by death! And he forgives you! If there's anything wrong with him, it's his kind heart. Do you think anyone wouldn't turn there back to you after something like that!? Huh?!"  
碇真嗣对着她大声回击。“那是因为你表现得像个小孩子！你意识到你做了什么吗？你在战场上攻击了自己的同伴。在任何国家，这都是不服从命令的行为，可以处以死刑！而他原谅了你！如果他有什么问题，那就是他太善良了。你以为经过那样的事情后，还有人会不对你背过身去吗？！嗯？！”

Asuka cringed. Unexpected to the major, she broke down and started to cry. "Why do I need him? Why am I so incapable that I need someone like him to take pity on me? Why!?"  
明日香缩了一下。出乎少校意料的是，她崩溃了，开始哭泣。“为什么我需要他？为什么我这么无能，需要像他这样的人来怜悯我？为什么！？”

Misato softened up. "He's not taking pity on you, Asuka. He really cares about you. Wouldn't you do the same for him if the same thing was happening to him?"  
碇真嗣语气缓和下来。“他不是在怜悯你，明日香。他是真的在乎你。如果同样的事情发生在他身上，你难道不会为他做同样的事吗？”

Asuka stuttered. "Yeah…no…I don't know what to think!"  
明日香结巴地说：“是…不是…我不知道该怎么想！”

Misato put her hand on Asuka's shoulder. "I heard what you said. About how he could act like such a wimp at home, but still manages to master the Evangelion. Do you know why that is?"  
美里把手放在明日香的肩上。“我听到了你说的。关于他在家可以表现得像个懦夫，但仍然能够驾驭福音战士。你知道为什么吗？”

Asuka shook her head. 明日香摇了摇头。

"It's because he has nothing else to hope for," Misato said. "Everything he's ever turned to has always let him down. But when he heard those words from his father: "Good work." It was like a beckoning to him. Asuka, I think praise is more valuable to him than it is to you. I try to give it as often as I can. But it doesn't amount to anything compared to his father's. And the way he gets it from his father is by being a good EVA pilot. So all he has to turn to is this machine that not even the best scientists understand. And you know something else?"  
"这是因为除了这个，他已别无希望，" 葛城美里说道。"他所依赖的一切总是让他失望。但当他从父亲那里听到那句话：'干得好。' 这对他来说就像是一种召唤。明日香，我认为赞扬对他来说比你想象的更有价值。我尽可能多地给予他赞扬。但与来自他父亲的相比，这些都微不足道。他从父亲那里得到认可的方式就是成为一个优秀的 EVA 驾驶员。所以他只能依赖这台连最优秀的科学家都无法完全理解的机器。你还知道别的吗？"

Asuka shook her head. 明日香摇了摇头。

"When he finally fought back against you…that wasn't _him_ fighting," Misato said.  
"当他最终对你反击时……那并不是他在战斗，" 葛城美里说。

Asuka caught her breath. 明日香屏住了呼吸。

"Why do you think he's so valuable a pilot, Asuka? It's not because of his synch rate or his skill. It's the fact the he can synchronize best with unit 01. And unit 01, when brought to full potential, is the most formidable EVA of them all. Did you ever see the videos from his first fight?"  
你为什么认为他是一个如此有价值的驾驶员，明日香？这并不是因为他的同步率或他的技术。而是因为他能与 01 号机达到最佳同步。而 01 号机，一旦发挥出全部潜力，就是所有 EVA 中最强大的。你看过他第一次战斗的视频吗？

Asuka shook her head. "No…"  
明日香摇了摇头。"没有……

Misato smiled. "Come with me…"  
葛城微笑着。“跟我来…”

Misato took her out of the cell and lead her to a small room with a video screen. She took a tape and slid it into the slot. "Now, watch carefully…"  
葛城带她走出牢房，领她来到一个装有视频屏幕的小房间。她拿出一盘录像带，插入插槽。“现在，仔细看…”

Asuka saw as EVA unit 01 was launched to the city to fight Sachiel, the third Angel. He tried walking and managed a single step. He tried for a second, and fell flat on his face.  
明日香看到 EVA 初号机被发射到城市去对抗第三使徒萨基尔。它试图行走，勉强迈出了一步。它尝试第二次，却脸朝下摔倒了。

That was all he managed to do before the Angel picked him up by the face, broke his arm, and smashed his eye through. After being sent careening into a building, Unit 01 went silent.  
那就是他所能做的全部，随后使徒抓住他的脸，折断了他的手臂，并砸碎了他的眼睛。在被猛烈撞击进一座建筑后，零号机陷入了沉默。

Asuka watched in silence as the EVA came to life again. It flipped over and landed knees first on the angel. It flipped over it again, and reared back to face it. Lunging after it, unit 01 ran into its AT field.  
明日香静静地看着 EVA 再次苏醒。它翻了个身，双膝着地落在使徒身上。再次翻过身来，它挺直身体面对使徒。猛冲过去时，零号机撞上了它的 AT 力场。

That's when unit 01 regenerated its arm. Asuka gasped. "Hey, that's…"  
就在那时，零号机再生了它的手臂。明日香倒吸一口凉气。“嘿，那是……”

The berserker plunged its fingers deep into the AT field, and split it open. Then, it grabbed both the Angel's arms, and broke them simultaneously. Then, delivering a powerful kick, he ripped the arms off entirely.  
狂战士将手指深深插入 AT 力场，将其撕裂。随后，它抓住天使的双臂，同时将其折断。紧接着，猛地一脚踢出，彻底将双臂扯下。

The angel went flying backwards until it hit another building. The EVA galloped after it, and slammed into it hard. So hard, it took the building along for the ride.  
天使向后飞去，直至撞上另一栋建筑。EVA 疾驰追去，猛烈撞击，力度之大，连同建筑一起拖行。

"Seem familiar, Asuka?" asked Misato.  
“看起来眼熟吗，明日香？” 美里问道。

"That's…" she muttered. "那真是……" 她喃喃自语。

Unit 01 began smashing the core, until it decide to rip off a piece of the angel and use it as a tool for chipping the core. Angel's eyes lit, and it wrapped its arms around the EVA. It's core glowing, it blew into a cross-like explosion.  
初号机开始猛击核心，直到它决定撕下天使的一块，用作敲击核心的工具。天使的眼睛亮了起来，它用双臂紧紧抱住 EVA。其核心发出光芒，随后爆炸成十字形的火焰。

Unit was then seen walking slowly out of the ruble, one eye dead, and the others, gleaming as angrily as a demon.  
随后，初号机缓缓从废墟中走出，一只眼睛已死寂，而另一只，则如恶魔般愤怒地闪烁着。

That's when the movie clicked off. "The point I'm trying to make is…" Misato said, "Shinji wasn't controlling any of that. His EVA is the only one that can go into berserker mode. His is the only one that has the potential to run without power, and become a fighting machine that's simply unstoppable. Even to the pilot. Do you know what, Asuka?"  
就在这时，电影突然停止了。\"我想说的是……\" 葛城美里说道，\"真嗣并没有控制任何事情。他的 EVA 是唯一能进入狂战士模式的。他的 EVA 是唯一有可能在无电源状态下运行，并变成一个对驾驶员来说都难以阻挡的战斗机器。你知道吗，明日香？\

Asuka looked up at her.  
明日香抬头看着她。

"When I opened the hatch and saw him, he was begging his EVA not to kill you. _Begging_, Asuka. He was just repeating over the phrase "Don't kill her" over again."  
当我打开舱门看到他时，他正在恳求他的 EVA 不要杀你。他在恳求，明日香。他只是一遍又一遍地重复着‘不要杀她’这句话。

Asuka's eyes flew open. "He was…trying to save me?"  
明日香的眼睛猛地睁开。“他是在……试图救我吗？”

"So you see, Asuka, he's not important because he's better than you. He's important because unit 01 will only accept him. Sometimes it will accept Rei, but recently, tests have shown that it won't any more. Shinji is the only one who can pilot it best, and you know why?"  
所以你看，明日香，他之所以重要，并不是因为他比你强。他重要是因为零号机只接受他。有时候也会接受绫波，但最近测试显示，它不再接受绫波了。真嗣是唯一能最好地驾驶它的人，你知道为什么吗？

Asuka's eyes were shining with an uncomfortable fear. "W…why?"  
明日香的眼中闪烁着不安的恐惧。“为……为什么？”

"You've heard about the accident with unit 01 and Shinji's mother right?" Misato said.  
"你听说过 01 号机和真嗣母亲的事故吧？" 美里说道。

Asuka nodded. 明日香点了点头。

"Well, according to Ritsuko, Yui Ikari wasn't killed in the accident. She became part of unit 01."  
"嗯，根据律子的说法，碇唯并没有在那场事故中丧生。她成为了 01 号机的一部分。"

Asuka gasped. "You mean…?"  
明日香倒吸一口凉气。“你是说……？”

Misato nodded. "Yes. Shinji's mother's soul is in his EVA."  
美里点头道：“是的。真嗣母亲的灵魂就在他的 EVA 里。”

Asuka lowered her head. "So of course he's a good pilot. He's piloting under his mothers care."  
明日香低下头。“难怪他是个好驾驶员。他在母亲的庇护下驾驶。”

Misato shook her head. "It's really as simple as that."  
葛城摇了摇头。“真的就这么简单。”

"So I've been jealous over nothing?" Asuka looked back up at Misato.  
“所以我一直都在无端嫉妒？”明日香抬头看向葛城。

Misato placed her hand on her shoulder. "Asuka…there is nothing more important to Shinji than acceptance from others. Right now, Asuka, he really needs your acceptance."  
葛城将手放在她的肩上。“明日香……对真嗣来说，没有什么比得到他人的认可更重要了。现在，明日香，他真的需要你的认可。”

Asuka looked up. "Huh?" 明日香抬头。“嗯？”

"You need to make a choice here, Asuka," Misato went on. "Shinji saved your life, and he forgives you for everything you've ever done. The question is, are you going to be jealous about it, or are you going to thank him for it?"  
“在这里，你需要做出选择，明日香，”美里继续说道。“真嗣救了你的命，并且原谅了你过去所做的一切。问题是，你是要对此感到嫉妒，还是要为此感谢他？”

Misato left the room. "You're free to go. Please make the right choice."  
美里离开了房间。“你可以走了。请做出正确的选择。”

Asuka sat there for a moment before kneeling and sobbing into her hands.  
明日香在那里坐了一会儿，然后跪下，双手掩面哭泣起来。

xxxxx

Shinji's door opened. Shinji was curled up into a ball. He could make out Asuka's silhouette from her shadow. His face turned into a scowl.  
真嗣的门打开了。真嗣蜷缩成一团。他能从她的影子中辨认出明日香的轮廓。他的脸上露出了不悦的表情。

"Shinji?" came an uncommonly soft voice from Asuka. "Wake up…"  
“真嗣？”明日香的声音异常柔和，“醒醒……”

"I'm not asleep," said Shinji.  
"我没睡着，" 真嗣说道。

"I know…" Asuka said, stepping over to him. She sat down at the foot of his bed. They sat there like that for several minutes before anyone said anything. Just sitting.  
"我知道…" 明日香说着，走到他身边。她坐在床尾。两人就这样静静地坐了几分钟，谁也没有开口。只是坐着。

Asuka sighed. "Well, I-" 明日香叹了口气。 "嗯，我-"

"Asuka?" Shinji interrupted, sitting up suddenly in bed.  
"明日香？" 真嗣突然从床上坐起来打断道。

"What?" she asked. "怎么了？" 她问道。

"Did…anything happen to you?" Shinji asked. "After you got out of the EVA? You didn't…get punished or anything, right?"  
"你…有没有发生什么事？" 真嗣问道，"从 EVA 里出来后，你没有…受到惩罚什么的，对吧？"

Asuka looked sadly at him. "No…"  
明日香悲伤地看着他。“不…”

Shinji sighed. "Good." He lay back down.  
真嗣叹了口气。“好。”他又躺了回去。

Asuka began quivering. "How can you be so sympathetic to me after everything I've done to you?"  
明日香开始颤抖。“我对你做了那么多事，你怎么还能对我这么同情？”

"It's…kind of hard to explain, Asuka," Shinji said. "It's like…being…separated from everyone like this…it makes it so…I don't…really have to feel like this is my life. Like what I'm living is just a big joke, and it's not really what's going on. But…even when I do that…I still feel bad when someone suffers because of me. So I…do whatever I can…to make it better…somehow."  
"这…有点难以解释，明日香，" 真嗣说道，"就像是…与所有人隔离开来…这让我觉得…我并不…真的需要感受这就是我的生活。仿佛我所经历的只是一个大笑话，并非真实发生的事情。但是…即便我这么想…当有人因我而受苦时，我仍然感到难过。所以我…尽我所能…设法让它变得好一些…不知怎么的。"

Asuka sighed. "I guess it's too late to say I'm sorry."  
明日香叹了口气，"我想现在说对不起已经太晚了。"

Shinji shook his head, "It's really ok, Asuka."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"真的没关系，明日香。"

"How can you say it's ok?" she yelled. "It's terrible! Shinji, you're never going to have a life until you learn to accept what's true. Things are bad! That's the way they are!"  
"你怎么能说没事呢？" 她喊道，"太糟糕了！真嗣，除非你学会接受真相，否则你永远不会拥有生活。事情就是很糟糕！这就是现实！"

Shinji shook his head. "I don't blame you for anything."  
真嗣摇了摇头，"我并不怪你。"

Asuka sighed. "You should."  
明日香叹了口气，"你应该怪我。"

Shinji looked back at her.  
真嗣回头看向她。

Asuka stared at him hard. "Do you have any idea what it's like? To have every bad memory from your past simply thrust into your face?"  
明日香狠狠地盯着他。“你知道那是什么感觉吗？过去的每一个糟糕记忆都被硬生生地推到你面前？”

Shinji sighed. "More than you know?"  
真嗣叹了口气。“比你想象的还要多。”

"What?" she responded. "什么？" 她回应道。

Shinji closed his eyes. "If you're really hurt by the bad memories, than that must mean that you've had good memories too."  
真嗣闭上了眼睛。"如果你真的被那些糟糕的回忆所伤，那一定意味着你也有过美好的回忆。"

Asuka gasped. "Come on, Shinji! You can't tell me you've never had one good memories before?"  
明日香倒吸一口凉气。"拜托，真嗣！你不会告诉我你以前从没有过任何美好的回忆吧？"

Shinji sighed. "Ever since my father left me…I've never had a single good memory."  
真嗣叹了口气。“自从我父亲离开我之后……我从未有过任何美好的回忆。”

Asuka leaned towards him. "What if…your father accepted you? Would you feel better then?"  
明日香向他靠近。“如果……你父亲接受了你呢？那样你会感觉好些吗？”

Shinji looked up "Absolutely. But that's never going to happen. You've heard the commander speak before. He treats Rei better than he treats me."  
真嗣抬头说：“当然会。但那永远不会发生。你以前也听过指挥官说话。他对待绫波比对待我好多了。”

Asuka looked shocked. "That's terrible." Looking back at him, she said, "So that's why you lock yourself away? Because you just hate reality?"  
明日香看起来很震惊。“那太糟糕了。”她回头看着他说，“所以这就是你把自己封闭起来的原因吗？因为你只是讨厌现实？”

Shinji shut his eyes. "Yeah, that's just it. That's just what I am, right? Shinji Ikari: The cold angry hatred of the truth."  
真嗣闭上了眼睛。“是的，就是这样。我就是这样的，对吧？碇真嗣：对真相的冷漠愤怒的憎恨。”

Asuka looked sadly at him. "What if…what if _I_ accepted you? Would that make you feel better?"  
明日香悲伤地看着他。“如果……如果我接受你呢？那会让你感觉好些吗？”

Shinji looked back at her. "You…you'd do that?"  
真嗣回头看向她。“你……你会这么做吗？”

Asuka nodded. "Shinji…I've never met anyone like you before. And I've come to know you so well, that…well, I just couldn't imagine my life without you."  
明日香点了点头。“真嗣……我以前从未遇到过像你这样的人。我对你了解得如此之深，以至于……嗯，我简直无法想象没有你的生活。”

That one comment made Shinji blush.  
就是这句话让真嗣脸红了。

Asuka scowled. "Don't get all shy on me now."  
明日香皱了皱眉。“别现在给我害羞起来。”

Shinji lowered his eyes. "Sorry."  
真嗣垂下目光。“对不起。”

Asuka took his face in her hands. "If I do…you have do one thing for me, though."  
明日香双手捧住他的脸。“如果我这么做……你得为我做一件事，不过。”

Shinji looked a little worried. "What?"  
真嗣看起来有些担忧。“什么？”

Asuka smiled. "Stop apologizing all the time. You think that everything's your fault. You blame yourself for everything. Honestly, it needs to stop."  
明日香微笑着说：“别总是道歉。你总觉得什么都是你的错。你把一切都归咎于自己。老实说，这得停下来了。”

Shinji looked at her for a while. Then he smiled too. "And you…do this for me."  
真嗣凝视了她一会儿，然后也笑了。“而你……为我做这些。”

"What?" Asuka inquired. "什么？" 明日香问道。

"Stop pretending that nobody cares about you," Shinji said. "We all care about you, Asuka. We're not all out to get you or something. We're in this together, all right?"  
"别再装作没人关心你了，" 真嗣说，"我们都关心你，明日香。我们并不是都想害你什么的。我们是一起的，明白吗？"

Asuka looked at him and sighed. "Alright."  
明日香看着他，叹了口气。"好吧。"

With that, they both fell into each other's arms, tears of joy falling down their faces. They held each other tightly, until Asuka said, "Shinji?"  
"就这样，他们紧紧相拥，喜悦的泪水顺着脸颊滑落。他们紧紧抱着对方，直到明日香轻声唤道：“真嗣？””

He looked at her. "Yes?"  
"他看向她，回应道：“嗯？””

Asuka smiled quaintly at her. "Th…thank you."  
"明日香对她的他露出了一个微妙的笑容，“谢…谢谢你。””

Shinji smiled back. "Of course."  
真嗣回以微笑。"当然。"

Asuka then kissed him briefly on the lips, before getting up and standing quietly by the door. "Good night, Shinji."  
明日香随后轻轻吻了他的唇，起身静静地站在门口。"晚安，真嗣。"

She left quickly, rather embarrassed about all that.  
她迅速离开，对这一切感到相当尴尬。

Shinji stared at the door where she had left. He then smiled and lay back down in his bed. "Asuka…I think now…I'll have a happy memory to look back on."  
真嗣凝视着她离去的门口，随后微笑着躺回床上。“明日香……我想现在……我有了一个值得回忆的快乐瞬间。”

The End 完

Well, there you have it. Even though I prefer Shinji x Rei fics, I wrote this just to prove I can accept an S/A pairing.  
好了，就是这样。尽管我更喜欢真嗣和零的同人文，但写这篇只是为了证明我也能接受 S/A 配对。

So what do you think of the overall storyline? I was getting rather tired of all those fics where Shinji and Asuka are secretly in love with each other and refuse to admit it. That's SO OLD! The way I made it, they each solve each other's problems.  
那么，你觉得整个故事情节如何？我已经厌倦了那些真嗣和明日香暗自相爱却拒绝承认的同人文。太老套了！我这样安排，他们各自解决了对方的问题。

But then they all die in EoE, so what's the point of it all?  
但后来他们在 EoE 中都死了，那这一切的意义何在？

Heh, heh, heh, just razzing you.  
嘿嘿嘿，只是逗你玩呢。

I'm out. 我撤了。
