**Flashback: Asuka then slowly moved closer to Shinji, closing the gap between them and kissed him on the cheek.  
闪回：那时，明日香缓缓靠近真嗣，缩短了两人之间的距离，在他的脸颊上轻轻一吻。**

"**Asuka you know what."**  “明日香，你知道什么。”

"**What Shinji?"**  “什么事，真嗣？”

"**You really are beautiful."**  
“你真的很美。”

"Well, Shinji what do you like about me?"  
“那么，真嗣，你喜欢我什么地方呢？”

"Ummm...You're kind side…"  
"嗯...你善良的一面…"

"So you think I'm kind, Third Child"  
"这么说你认为我是个好人，三少爷"

"Yes I do…" "是的，我是这么认为的…"

"I'll show you how kind I can be after my performance."  
"我会让你看看我在表演后能有多么温柔。"

Shinji couldn't believe he had finally told Asuka that he liked her and on top of it all he hadn't been rejected. Life was looking up for the younger Ikari. The sudden announcement that it was Asuka's turn pulled him back into reality.  
真嗣简直不敢相信，他终于告诉了明日香他喜欢她，而且最重要的是，他没有被拒绝。对于年轻的碇来说，生活似乎正在好转。突然宣布轮到明日香上台，让他回到了现实。

"Come on, Shinji watch me sing."  
"来吧，真嗣，看我唱歌。"

All Shinji could say was a single "Ok…"  
真嗣只能说出一个“好…”

"Asuka and Hikari you're up next."  
“明日香和美里，接下来是你们。”

"OK!" said the two in unison.  
“好的！”两人齐声说道。

"This is going to be hilarious, seeing Asuka sing," snickered Touji.  
"看明日香唱歌，这一定会很搞笑，" 东治窃笑着说。

"The Devil Girl is going to put the house on fire, literally," added Kensuke.  
"恶魔女孩会把房子点燃的，字面意义上的，" 真希补充道。

"Shut up you guys," shouted Shinji.  
"你们闭嘴，" 真嗣喊道。

Shinji was getting a bit put off at his friends' remarks of his new found girlfriend.  
真嗣对他的朋友们对他新交的女朋友的评论感到有些不快。

Asuka and Hikari stepped up on to the stage. Both walked up to their microphones.  
明日香和光里走上了舞台。两人都走向了各自的麦克风。

"You ready" “准备好了吗”

"Yep…lets do this." "没错…我们开始吧。"

The lights began to fade away and the music started to play.  
灯光开始渐渐淡去，音乐随之响起。

The pulsating sound of the speakers filled the air.  
扬声器中传出的脉动声响充斥着空气。

Then it began… 然后一切开始了…

Applause exploded from the crowd.  
人群中爆发出掌声。

"Gosh, that Devil Girl can sure sing."  
"天哪，那个恶魔女孩唱得真好。"

"I'm stunned, shocked really."  
"我惊呆了，真的震惊了。"

Shinji was surprised by Asuka's performace.  
真嗣对明日香的表现感到惊讶。

The song she had sung seemed to express many of her feelings which Shinji hoped that their new formed relationship could clarify. Applause seemed to carry on for a few minutes before the last clap faded away. Asuka and Hikari Both walked off stage.  
她所唱的歌似乎表达了许多她的情感，真嗣希望他们新建立的关系能够澄清这些。掌声似乎持续了几分钟，直到最后一声掌声消散。明日香和光一同走下了舞台。

Asuka was feeling great, not only had she just finished the perfect performance, but now she had admitted her feelings to Shinji. Time seemed to slow down when she sang the song, she focused on Shinji in he crowd. Drawn to his presence by some mysterious force. She had first thought of Shinji was nothing more than a spineless wimp. But, as she had got to know him better she had started to develop feelings for him which had recently been confirmed with three simple words, "I like you."  
明日香感觉棒极了，不仅刚刚完成了完美的表演，现在她还向真嗣坦白了心意。当她唱歌时，时间似乎放慢了，她的目光聚焦在人群中的真嗣身上。某种神秘的力量将她吸引到他的存在。她最初认为真嗣不过是个没骨气的懦夫。但随着她对他的了解加深，她开始对他产生了感情，最近这感情被三个简单的字眼所确认，“我喜欢你。”

Nothing too serious like "I love you" but just enough for them to start a relationship.  
虽然没有“我爱你”那么严重，但足以让他们开始一段关系。

"What did you think, Shinj?"  
"你觉得怎么样，真嗣？"

"Asuka you were great" "明日香，你表现得真棒"

"You know you really do have a beautiful voice, Asuka"  
"你知道吗，明日香，你的声音真的很美"  
Asuka started to blush slightly from the compliment.  
明日香听到夸奖后，脸上微微泛起了红晕。

"Shinji what did you just say" interjected Touji.  
“真嗣，你刚才说什么了？” 冬二插话道。

"I said nothing Touji…umm nothing at all"  
“我什么都没说，冬二……呃，真的什么都没说。”

"I swear I heard you say she had a beautiful voice."  
"我发誓我听到你说她声音很美。"

"So..what If I did I'm entitled to my own opinions Touji."  
"那又怎样，我有权表达自己的看法，东治。"

"Shinji you actually complimented the Devil Girl, after what shes put you through"  
"真嗣，你居然夸赞了那个魔女，她对你做了那么多过分的事。"

"Have you lost your mind…do I need to take you to a psychologist."  
"你是不是疯了……需要我带你去看心理医生吗。"

"Shut up Touji…just lay off it."  
"闭嘴，冬二……别再说了。"

"Whatever rocks your boat Shinji."  
"随你便，真嗣。"  
"Shin-man I'm always there for you...So if she mauls your face off, just give me a call and I'll sort her out."  
"伸-君，我永远在你身边...所以如果她把你脸抓花了，就给我打电话，我会搞定她的。"

"She'll probably sort you out…" mumbled Kensuke  
"她可能会先把你搞定…" 健介咕哝道

"What did you say Kensuke" shouted Touji.  
"你说什么，健介？" 斗志大声喊道。"

"I said you could probably sort her out with no trouble at all."  
"我说过你大概能轻松搞定她。"

"You would probably need an ambulance and paramedic team  
"你可能需要一辆救护车和急救团队"

But you would survive…" 但你还是会活下来…"

"KENSUKE, I'm gonna ring your neck you stupid nerd…"  
"健介，我要拧断你这个蠢书呆子的脖子……"  
"Is that all the jock with a brain the size of a peanut, can say"  
"这就是那个脑容量只有花生大小的运动员能说的话吗"

"Is Touji gonna go and cry to his girlfriend, the Class Rep."  
"东治是要去找他的女朋友，班长哭诉吗？"

"Kensuke you will wish you never said that after I'm finished with you"  
"健介，等你尝到我的厉害后，你会后悔说那句话的。"

"Damn…those stooges are annoying," said Asuka  
"该死……那些家伙真烦人，"明日香说道

"They can never stop doing stupid things"  
"他们总是不停地做蠢事。"

"So, what did Shinji want to talk to you about after his performance?" asked Hikari  
“那么，真嗣表演结束后想跟你谈什么？” 光问道

"Nothing…much just whose turn it was to make dinner tonight," replied Asuka nervously.  
“没什么…只是今晚轮到谁做饭了，” 明日香紧张地回答。

Asuka thinking: "I hope no one else noticed that…"  
明日香心想：“希望没人注意到那件事…”

"Asuka what did you really think about Shinji's performance?" asked Hikari  
"明日香，你真的觉得真嗣的表现怎么样？" 光问

"I never knew Shinji could sing, that song was incredible."  
"我从不知道真嗣会唱歌，那首歌太不可思议了。"

"I thought it was…okay…nothing special," commented Asuka hesitantly  
"我觉得……还行吧……没什么特别的，" 明日香犹豫地说

"You know he really sang his heart out Asuka."  
"你知道他真的为 Asuka 倾尽全力歌唱了。"  
"I wonder who the song was meant for."  
"我在想这首歌是唱给谁的。"

"Probably for Rei…" "大概是给 Rei 的吧…"

"Rei, no way that lifeless doll…not in a hundred years!" exclaimed Asuka.  
"丽，那个毫无生气的玩偶……一百年都不可能！"明日香惊呼道。

Asuka finally realised that Hikari had caught her out. Sometimes she wished she never spoke things out loud.  
明日香终于意识到光已经抓住了她的把柄。有时候她真希望自己从没把话说出口。

"So, then who else could it be Asuka."  
"那么，还能是谁呢，明日香。"

"There's only one other person I could think of."  
"我想不到还有其他人了。"

"She's standing right in front of me."  
"她就站在我面前。"

"Hikari, how did you know?"  
"光，你怎么知道的？"  
"I saw the way Shinji stared at you throughout his whole song."  
"我注意到真嗣整首歌都在盯着你看。"

"Please, don't tell anyone not even your jock boyfriend, Touji."  
"拜托，别告诉任何人，包括你那位运动员男友，东治。"

"You, two practically are."  
"你们俩，几乎就是了。"

"I guess so…" "我想是的…"

"Well, anyway Asuka what did Shinji say to you. I promise I won't tell anyone."  
"好吧，不管怎样，明日香，真嗣对你说了什么？我保证不会告诉任何人。"

"OK..he said that he likes me.."  
"好吧…他说他喜欢我…"

"And what did you say back."  
"那你回了什么？"

" I said I liked him too."  
"我说我也喜欢他。"

"You, know Asuka you two suit each other perfectly."  
"你知道吗，明日香，你们俩真是天造地设的一对。"

"You make such a cute couple."  
"你们看起来真是一对可爱的情侣。"

"Yeah…whatever Hikari." "是啊……随便吧，光。"

"Geez I wonder how Shinji is doing."  
"天哪，不知道真嗣现在怎么样了。"

"Sometimes those guys can be just a bit overbearing," thought Shinji.  
"有时候那些家伙真是有点过于强势了，" 真嗣心想。

"I hope no body else suspects me of something."  
"希望没人怀疑我什么。"

Shinji was about to get the biggest shock of his life.  
真嗣即将迎来他人生中最大的震惊。

"Pilot Ikari.." "碇司令.."

"Is that you Rei." "是你吗，绫波。"

"Yes.." "是的.."

"Rei what is it?" asked Shinji uncertain.  
"丽，怎么了？" 真嗣不确定地问道。

"I wanted to know about that song"  
"我想知道那首歌的事"

"The song I sang?" "我唱的那首歌？"

"Yes" “是”

"Who was it for?" “这是给谁的？”

"No one in particular" “不是特别给谁的”

"You stared at Asuka for the duration of the whole song"  
"你整首歌的时间里都盯着明日香"

"Why were you looking at her was she in danger"  
"你为什么看她，她有危险吗"

"No…" "不…"

"I just…." "我只是…."

"So, Shinji whats been happening," interrupted Asuka  
"那么，真嗣，最近发生了什么？" 明日香打断道

"Whats Wondergirl doing here."  
"绫波零在这里做什么？"

"Pilot Sohryu I was just wondering why Shinji was staring at you."  
"飞行员惣流一，我只是好奇为什么真嗣一直盯着你。"

"Wow, that was a mouthful Wondergirl."  
"哇，这话可真多，奇迹少女。"

"He must be charmed b my eternal beauty."  
"他一定是被我永恒的美貌迷住了。"  
"Right, Third Child." "好的，三号机。"

Shinji thinking: Why do I always get myself into these type of situations?  
真嗣心想：为什么我总是陷入这种境地？

"Yes…" whispered Shinji. "是的……" 真嗣低声说道。

"So you think I'm beautiful Third Child."  
"所以你认为我是美丽的第三适格者。"

"YES!" exclaimed Shinji. ""是的！"" 真嗣大声说道。

Shinji had without knowing just admitted in front of everyone that he liked Asuka.  
真嗣在不知不觉中，当着所有人的面承认了他喜欢明日香。

"Well, Third Child heres your reward."  
"好吧，三笠，这是你的奖励。"  
Asuka then went in for a kiss, but this time she kissed him on the lips in front of the entire grade.  
明日香接着上前亲吻，但这次她当着全年级的面吻在了他的唇上。

"Did you really have to do that Asuka."  
"你真的非得这么做吗，明日香。"

"Shinji, they were going to find out sooner or later."  
"真嗣，他们迟早会发现的。"

Gasps were heard throughout the auditorium.  
礼堂里响起一片惊呼声。

"Betrayed!" Shouted both Kensuke and Touji.  
"背叛了！" 健介和渡治同时喊道。

"You have broken the sacred band of brothers."  
"你破坏了神圣的兄弟联盟。"

"You are dead to us Shinji," exclaimed Touji.  
"你对我们来说已经死了，真嗣，" 东治喊道。"

"You're one to speak Touji."  
"你还有脸说东治。"

"If anyone broke the sacred band"  
"如果有人打破了神圣的誓言"

"It was you and your girlfriend, the Class Rep."  
"就是你和你女朋友，班长大人。"

"Don't deny it I saw the way you look at her while you eat lunch with her."  
"别否认，我看到你和她一起吃午饭时看她的眼神了。"

"So lovey dovey." "真是恩爱啊。"

"Kensuke! That's another beating!"  
"健介！又是一顿揍！"

"Those two never learn Hey! Shinji"  
"那两人就是学不乖！嘿！真嗣"

"I guess so…" "我想是的…"

"Whats the matter Shinji?" asked Asuka with a grin on her face.  
"怎么了，真嗣？" 明日香带着一脸坏笑问道。

"You really embarrassed me."  
"你真的让我很尴尬。"

"You should lucky to be with me."  
"你应该庆幸能和我在一起。"

"But, that was a bit too extreme."  
"但，那有点太过分了。"

"Shinji learn to relax." "真嗣，学会放松。"

"I was just joking." "我只是在开玩笑。"  
"Don't look at me like that."  
"别那样看着我。"

"I'm really sorry." "我真的很抱歉。"

"Ok I'll forgive you" "好吧，我原谅你了"

"But, please don't do that again."  
"不过，请不要再那样做了。"

"Maybe, I'll try something else Third Child."  
"或许，我会尝试点别的，三号机驾驶员。"

Meanwhile on the other side of the auditorium:  
与此同时，在礼堂的另一侧：

"Why don't you go and ask Rei to dance Kensuke," asked Touji.  
“你怎么不去邀请丽跳舞呢，健介？”问道。

"She would never dance with me."  
“她才不会跟我跳舞呢。”

"HEY! REI YOU WANNA DANCE WITH KENSUKE."  
"嘿！丽，你想和健介跳舞吗？"

"Would you mind Rei," asked Kensuke nervously.  
"你介意吗，丽？" 健介紧张地问道。"

"You don' have to if you don't want to."  
"如果你不想的话，不必勉强。"

"I would like to," replied Rei in a monotone.  
"我也愿意，"丽用单调的语气回答道。

"Rei, you look really beautiful tonight."  
"丽，你今晚看起来真美。  
Rei blushed at the compliment. She had noticed Kensuke a long time ago. But was always discouraged to talk to him.  
听到赞美，丽脸红了。她很久以前就注意到了健介，但总是因为害羞而不敢和他交谈。

"Thank you…" replied Rei "谢谢…" 丽回答道

"No problem." "没事。"

"Theres something I wanted to say to you"  
"有件事我想对你说"

"I…" "我…"

"What…" "什么…"

"I like you Rei" "我喜欢你，丽"

"I…think…I like you as well."  
"我…觉得…我也喜欢你。"

Rei then kissed Kensuke on the cheek.  
丽随后在健介的脸颊上亲了一下。

A blush spread across Kensuke's face.  
健介的脸上泛起了红晕。

"Thank you" was all he could manage to say.  
"谢谢" 是他勉强能说出口的话。

"The winner of the competition is…"  
"比赛获胜者是……"

"It seems to be a tie between Shinji and Asuka's teams."  
"看起来是真嗣队和明日香队之间打成了平手。"

"They both share first place prize."  
"他们俩并列第一名。"  
"That was a turn of events," said Shinji."  
"这真是出乎意料的转折，" 真嗣说道。"

"So, Third Child we seem to be on the same singing level."  
"那么，第三适格者，看来我们在歌唱水平上不相上下。"  
"But, I'm still a better Eva pilot."  
"但，我还是一个更优秀的 EVA 驾驶员。"

"Yes, Asuka you are…" "是的，明日香，你是……"

"But, you know what?" "但是，你知道吗？"

"What? Shinji." “什么？真嗣。”  
"I don't care if you're a better Eva pilot."  
“我才不在乎你是不是比我能干。”

"I'd love you even if you were not an Eva pilot."  
“即使你不是 Eva 驾驶员，我也一样爱你。”
