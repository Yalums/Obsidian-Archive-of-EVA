这段chapter中使用的歌曲是 Disclosure 的《Latch》。

---
Asuka was in the darkness again. A dark filled with pulsing lights, heart pounding music, and the echoing chatter of strangers. They surrounded her, just like in the dreams, and threatened to consume her hole, leaving nothing but a speck behind. She had retreated to a somewhat quiet corner in the bar, and was already feeling the head swaying effects of whatever liquor the bartender served her. 'Something for the pain', she had told him.  
明日香再次陷入了黑暗。这片黑暗中充斥着脉动的灯光、震耳欲聋的音乐，以及陌生人回荡的闲聊声。他们像梦里一样包围着她，威胁着要将她完全吞噬，只留下一丝痕迹。她躲到了酒吧里相对安静的一角，已经感受到了酒保递给她的任何酒精带来的摇晃感。‘来点止痛的’，她曾这样告诉他。

Asuka thought of alcoholism as truly a disgusting behavior, but days into her recovery from the Eva 03 incident, when the pain was becoming too excruciating and the pills were no longer having the effects, she discovered that that transparent liquid was her way out. It was her way out of the nightmares and the nausea, out of the panic attacks and the cold sweats.  
明日香认为酗酒行为实在是令人作呕，但在 Eva 03 事件后的康复期，当痛苦变得难以忍受，药物也不再有效时，她发现那透明液体成了她的出路。它是她逃离噩梦和恶心感、恐慌发作和冷汗的途径。

Not even NERV's best medicine and hospital care could save her from the pathetic limitations of the human body. And that's what she was at that point; she was no longer Captain Asuka Shikinami Langley, but just another body on the verge of...whatever it is that comes before death. Misato, Kaji, Rei, and even stupid Shinji were all there to give her their support, but she consistently rejected their presence in her hospital room. She couldn't even look at Ikari in the eyes; it wasn't worth her effort. If he had taken some action, _any_ action against Unit 03, most likely the dummy plug didn't need to be used. But he decided to do nothing.  
即使是 NERV 最顶尖的药物和医院护理，也无法挽救她免受人类身体那可悲的局限性。那时她已不再是明日香·式波·兰格雷上尉，而只是濒临...死亡前那一阶段的又一具躯体。美里、加持、绫波，甚至愚蠢的真嗣都在那里给予她支持，但她始终拒绝他们在病房中的陪伴。她甚至无法直视碇的眼睛；那不值得她费力。如果他当时采取了某些行动，对抗 03 号机，很可能根本不需要使用模拟插入栓。但他选择了无所作为。

With Misato the issue was somewhat similar. She gets sent off to quarantine after almost being ripped apart and crushed to death, and Misato still encouraged the brat to keep on his idiotic ways, even if it meant the end of the world. What a goddamn stupid woman, Asuka thinks sourly from time to time. Misato always preferred Shinji. He was her real family. Asuka, well, was just an extra in the flow of things. So the German decided to deal with her problems on her own, just like she was trained to do.  
美里的情况也有些类似。她在几乎被撕裂并压碎后被送去隔离，而美里仍然鼓励那小子继续他愚蠢的行为，即便这意味着世界的终结。真是个该死的蠢女人，明日香时不时地酸溜溜地想。美里总是偏爱真嗣。他才是她真正的家人。明日香，好吧，只是事情发展中的一个配角。所以这位德国女孩决定独自处理自己的问题，就像她被训练的那样。

Asuka's head got stone heavy by the time the liquor was nearing the bottom of the glass. She rubbed a temple as she tried to remember why she was here, in this downtown disco, in the first place. She looked over her shoulders, to a corner of the vast room, and spotted the NERV crew: Misato, Kaji, Ritsuko with a Maya close by, Aoba, Hyuga, Rei, Shinji, and the rest of the new recruits were all there, chatting away and looking as if they were having the time of their lives. Nothing stood out; what month was it? December? Most likely. She remembered seeing the word earlier that day on the fridge calendar. So she was at the pre-Christmas party.  
当酒杯快要见底时，明日香的头变得沉重如石。她揉着太阳穴，试图回忆自己为何会在这里，在这个市中心的迪斯科舞厅。她环顾四周，目光落在宽敞房间的一角，发现了 NERV 的成员们：美里、加持、律子身边紧跟着真希波，青叶、日向、绫波、真嗣，以及新招募的其他人，都在那里谈笑风生，仿佛正享受着人生中最美好的时光。一切看起来都很正常；现在是几月？十二月吗？很有可能。她记得那天早些时候在冰箱上的日历上看到了这个词。所以她是在圣诞节前的派对上。

A person joined the group late. Despite the darkness she could assemble the figure's height, pigtails, and red glasses. It was Mari Illustrious Makinami, her new combat partner. Asuka wasn't particularly fond of her; the girl was over-confident, boisterous, and just plain annoying, not what she had in mind for a life or death situation side kick. Oh, and she was British, just to make things more queer.  
有人迟到了才加入这个团体。尽管光线昏暗，她还是能辨认出那人的身高、双马尾和红色眼镜。那是真希波·真理·伊拉丝多莉亚斯，她的新战斗伙伴。明日香并不特别喜欢她；这个女孩过于自信、喧闹，而且非常烦人，完全不是她想象中生死攸关时的搭档。哦，对了，她还是个英国人，这更增添了事情的古怪。

But putting idiosyncrasies aside, she had to recognize that Mari was the only one who _stayed._ The only one who was persistent enough to visit her at the hospital and talk about nonsensical stories or gossip about romances between the staff. Mari was the one who occasionally brought that damn tasteless tea to warm her up. _Hang in there, Princess._  
但抛开这些怪癖不谈，她不得不承认，真里是唯一留下的人。只有她坚持不懈地来医院探望她，谈论些无厘头的故事或是八卦工作人员间的恋情。真里偶尔还会带来那该死的、淡而无味的茶，为她暖身。加油，公主。

Asuka studied her with tired, foggy eyes; the foreigner was expressively talking about something with Sakura Suzuhara, whom in return was laughing and eagerly responding. Little did she know that a jealous Sumire Nagara was onlooking from the background. The whole scenario made her laugh; jealousy wasn't something she completely understood. Asuka returned to her yellow colored drink, unaware that Mari too was quietly looking at her, and frowned at the cold, watery feeling that crept up behind her eyes. She tried to swallow the pathetic emotions down, but there they were, coming out in the smallest tears. Oblivion entered in her mind. Or maybe it was loneliness. She couldn't quite tell, but both notions made her feel beyond sick. She could live by herself. She didn't need anyone. She didn't need friends or attention or fucking endearment or-  
明日香用疲惫、朦胧的眼睛打量着她；那个外国人正兴致勃勃地和铃原樱谈论着什么，铃原樱则笑着热情回应。她不知道，嫉妒的奈良铃奈正在背后注视着这一切。整个场景让她发笑；嫉妒这种情感，她并不完全理解。明日香回到她的黄色饮料旁，没注意到真里也在默默地看着她，皱眉于眼后涌上的冰冷、水润的感觉。她试图咽下这些可悲的情绪，但它们还是化作细小的泪珠流露出来。遗忘侵入了她的脑海。又或许那是孤独。她无法确切分辨，但这两种感觉都让她感到极度不适。她可以独自生活。她不需要任何人。她不需要朋友、关注或该死的温情或——

A crisp, cracking sound startled Asuka from her thoughts. The sharp pain of a glass pierced hand rung out to her like a mad scream, punishing her for letting such sentimentality get in her way. She let out an unperceived grunt as she curled her body and brought the bloody hand to her chest. _Scheiße . Fucking shit._  
一声清脆的破裂声惊醒了绫波的思绪。玻璃刺穿手掌的剧痛如同疯狂的尖叫般传来，惩罚她让这种多愁善感妨碍了自己。她发出一声未被察觉的闷哼，蜷缩起身躯，将流血的手按在胸前。该死。真他妈的糟糕。

Her frustration quickly turned into an inhuman rage she knew too well. Her hidden eye started to glow with the raw anger of an encaged animal. _No, not here._ Asuka cast a deathly grip on her eye patch as it all came tumbling down on her: the dizziness, the pain, the suffocating fury. Her body started to react against her; Asuka felt her neck painfully quiver with an invisible pressure, the muscles fibers in her arms seemed to break like tense cords flexed beyond their limits, her stomach cringed when something hot and viscous flipped inside it. A silent and pleading gasp jerked her shoulders backwards. It was mixing up with the music, the worthless laughter, the pathetic presence of Shinji, and the falling synch ratios in rapid, torturous flashes to the point that Asuka felt like passing out.  
她的沮丧迅速转化为她再熟悉不过的非人愤怒。她隐藏的眼睛开始闪烁着被囚禁动物般的原始怒火。不，不能在这里。绫波紧紧抓住眼罩，一切如山崩地裂般袭来：眩晕、疼痛、令人窒息的狂怒。她的身体开始反抗她；绫波感到脖子在无形压力下痛苦地颤抖，手臂肌肉纤维仿佛紧绷的绳索断裂，胃部因某种热而粘稠的东西翻腾而抽搐。一声无声而恳求的喘息使她的肩膀向后猛地一抖。这一切与音乐、无谓的笑声、真嗣那可悲的存在以及同步率急剧下降的痛苦闪现交织在一起，以至于绫波感到快要昏厥。

She could feel herself falling to the side when a small pressure on her clenched hand startled her from the swirling shock. The salty taste of sweat had pooled on her lips, and her heartbeat hurt such that it was hard to breathe. Asuka turned and found, astonishingly, Mari to be standing beside her with a worried look.  
她能感觉到自己正向一侧倒去，这时紧握的手上传来一丝轻微的压力，将她从旋转的震惊中惊醒。汗水咸涩的味道在她唇边积聚，心跳之痛让她难以呼吸。明日香转头发现，令人惊讶的是，真希波正站在她身边，面露忧色。

"Hey, whats wrong?" The girl asked genuinely, suddenly being drawn to something in the dark. She noticed Asuka's trembling hand and the glistening shards. The broken glass on the bar, the glowing eye, Asuka's shaky exterior, it all rounded up to another one of those mental contamination attacks Ritsuko had warned about. Maris features softened as she reached out to grab her partners hand. "Oh, Asuka."  
“嘿，怎么了？”女孩真诚地问道，突然被黑暗中的某物吸引。她注意到明日香颤抖的手和闪烁的碎片。吧台上的碎玻璃，那只发光的眼睛，明日香摇摇欲坠的外表，这一切都构成了律子警告过的那种精神污染攻击。真希波的神情柔和下来，她伸出手去握住搭档的手。“哦，明日香。”

"Don't touch me!" The German spat out on the verge of growling. The last thing she wanted was pity.  
“别碰我！”德国女孩几乎咆哮着吐出这句话。她最不想要的就是怜悯。

When the British came closer her pierced hand instinctively lashed out with the full intent of hurting the persistent threat, but Mari grabbed Asukas wrist with cold precision, strongly holding onto it despite the Germans struggle. Asuka tried to seize Maris dominating grasp, only to have her remaining free hand held down as well.  
当英国人靠近时，她那被刺穿的手本能地猛然伸出，意图伤害这个持续的威胁，但玛丽以冷静的精确度抓住了明日香的手腕，尽管德国人挣扎，她仍牢牢地握住。明日香试图夺回主导权，却发现自己另一只自由的手也被按住了。

An icy glare from Asuka did nothing to agitate the otherwise serious Mari. When escape was out of the question she cast a downward gaze with a mumbled curse, feeling more tired than she should. She tried to breathe evenly as she felt her eye calming down and the rage subsiding into some hidden part of her.  
明日香冰冷的瞪视对原本严肃的玛丽毫无影响。当逃跑无望时，她低头低声咒骂，感到比应有的更加疲惫。她试图均匀呼吸，感觉到自己的眼睛平静下来，怒气消退到内心深处。

"You done?" “你完了吗？”

When Mari got no answer she gently caressed the back of Asuka's palm and turned it over to reveal the bloody mess of glass.  
当玛丽没有得到回应时，她轻轻抚摸着明日香手背，翻转过来，露出了血肉模糊的玻璃碎片。

"I said leave it. I'll take care of it at the hospital." Asuka said commandingly, swiping the sweat off her brow with shaky fingers.  
“我说了，别管它。到医院我会处理的。”明日香命令道，颤抖的手指抹去额头的汗水。

"Yeah, and let it infest on the way there? You'd be wise to treat it now, Captain." Mari responded with the slightest hint of a tease.  
“是啊，让它在路上感染吗？你现在处理才是明智之举，队长。”玛丽回应道，语气中带着一丝微妙的调侃。

"Tch." "啧。"

Soft fingers lifted Asuka's chin as to level with Maris wide grin, "I'll be gentle", she said before finishing with a wink.  
柔软的手指抬起明日香的下巴，与麻里那灿烂的笑容平视，“我会温柔的”，她眨眼说道。

After cleaning the wound with water and getting somewhat of an approval from a disgruntled Asuka, Mari proceeded to carefully remove the shards of glass. Asuka considered her pain tolerance rather high, but the burning sting was still inevitable; luckily for her the pieces were large and few. A last coat of alcohol and fresh bandages that the British always had with her sealed the unfortunate event. Maris voice had returned to its naturally cheerful state. "All done, Princess. It shouldn't give any problems."  
在用水清洗伤口并得到明日香不悦的同意后，麻里小心翼翼地取出了玻璃碎片。明日香自认为疼痛耐受力相当高，但那灼烧般的刺痛仍不可避免；幸运的是，碎片大而少。最后一层酒精和英国人总是随身携带的新绷带封住了这不幸的事件。麻里的声音恢复了自然的欢快状态。“好了，公主。应该不会再有问题了。”

Asuka's head still felt heavy, but she focused on her fixed hand as it if was some part of her she couldn't recognize, as if it was the first time anyone had done anything for her, particularly because it was. The idea of being subject to someones care and attention scared her, but at the same time made her feel good in ways words couldn't describe. It just felt incredibly nice. A string of senseless words cut her focus. Mari was interrupting her again.  
明日香的头依旧沉重，但她专注于那只固定不动的手，仿佛那是她无法辨认的一部分，仿佛这是第一次有人为她做些什么，尤其是因为这确实是第一次。成为他人关怀和关注的对象让她感到害怕，但同时也以言语难以形容的方式让她感到美好。那种感觉非常舒适。一串无意义的词句打断了她的专注。真希波又在打扰她了。

"What did you say?" “你说什么？”

"I saaaaid, 'You wanna dance with me?' " The British teased with gleaming eyes.  
“我——说——，‘你想和我跳舞吗？’”英国女孩眨着闪亮的眼睛逗弄道。

"I think I'll pass." Asuka replied with a tired puff of air.  
"我想我还是算了。" 明日香带着疲惫的气息回答道。

"Think of it as returning a favor for your hand."  
"就当是还你手的情吧。"

_Damn she's persistent_. Asuka let out a weary sigh and glanced at the huge mass of turning bodies on the dance floor, thinking how horrible it would be to get in that ordeal. But on the other hand she had Mari, who could never receive 'no' for an answer. The sooner she did what Mari asked out of her the sooner she would be out of the way. One look at her partners light blue eyes was enough to receive the widest smile Asuka had ever seen as Mari gently took her by the hand to the center of the room.  
该死，她真执着。明日香疲惫地叹了口气，瞥了一眼舞池中旋转的人群，心想陷入那种混乱该有多糟糕。但另一方面，她有真希波，一个从不接受‘不’作为答案的人。越早完成真希波的要求，她就能越早脱身。只需看一眼她那浅蓝色眼睛的搭档，就足以看到明日香所见过的最灿烂的笑容，真希波温柔地牵起她的手，走向房间中央。

The claustrophobic mess that was the dance floor made Asuka's throat feel as if it was filled with the thickest cement. Mari held her close to avoid the shoving from rude drunks, with little success. After what seemed a grueling minute they reached a somewhat comfortable spot with enough space for Asuka to take a breath.  
舞池里那令人窒息的混乱让明日香感觉喉咙仿佛被最厚的水泥堵住。真里紧紧抱着她，试图避开那些粗鲁醉汉的推搡，但效果甚微。经过似乎漫长的一分钟后，他们终于到达了一个相对舒适的地方，有足够的空间让明日香喘口气。

"Sorry about that. I thought this would be your scene, you know? I've been told that Germans know how to party." Mari blatantly lied with an unrestrained smile.  
“抱歉，我以为你会喜欢这种场合，你知道吗？听说德国人很会派对。”真里带着不加掩饰的笑容，公然撒谎道。

"You're not as funny as you make yourself out to be, you know?" Asuka said between breaths, trying to find some strength as she shakily held onto one of her knees.  
“你没你自己想的那么有趣，你知道吗？”明日香喘着气说，试图找回一些力气，她颤抖地扶着一只膝盖。

On the floor a pair of dark shoes stepper closer into Asukas view, tempting her to look up. She suddenly found herself being drawn into Mari by gentle, yet strong arms that wrapped themselves around her neck and shoulders. The disco lights changed color and turned the room a hellish red. Maris turquoise eyes stood out with a glossy hostility, like a snake who wanted to wrap around her prey just for the contact. Asuka tried to part from their hypnotizing gaze, but her willpower wasn't keen as of tonight. Then they disappeared.  
地板上一双深色的鞋子缓缓步入明日香的视线，引诱她抬头。她突然发现自己被玛丽温柔而有力的双臂环绕，搂住了她的脖颈和肩膀。迪斯科灯光变换颜色，将房间染成一片地狱般的红色。玛丽那双蓝绿色的眼睛在光泽中透出敌意，宛如一条欲缠绕猎物仅为了接触的蛇。明日香试图挣脱那令人着迷的凝视，但今晚她的意志力并不坚定。随后，它们消失了。

"I'm not trying to be." The British whispered hotly in her partners ear. Mari stayed cheek to cheek with Asuka as she began to sway her body to the beat of the music. The song was heavy and fast, but she wanted to enjoy this tender moment with Asuka, even if it meant nothing in the long run.  
“我不是想这样。”英国人在她伴侣的耳边热切地低语。玛丽与明日香脸颊相贴，随着音乐的节拍开始摇摆身体。歌曲沉重而快速，但她想享受与明日香这温柔的一刻，即便长远来看这毫无意义。

Asuka, on the other hand, had never danced at a disco before and was holding onto Mari's sides for dear life. At first she was clumsy, with the alcohol still running in her system, but eventually she gathered enough footing to imitate Mari's changing movements with some form of success, in the way that two bodies touch each other briefly when dancing.  
另一方面，明日香从未在迪斯科舞厅跳过舞，紧紧抓住玛丽的两侧以求保命。起初她笨拙不堪，酒精仍在体内作祟，但最终她找到了足够的立足点，成功模仿玛丽变化多端的舞步，两人在跳舞时身体短暂接触。

Both girls were quiet for a while, seemingly focused on enjoying the others embrace more so than maintaining the same rhythm. Mari spoke first, slow and gently so that every word would get through.  
两位女孩沉默了一会儿，似乎更专注于享受对方的拥抱，而不是保持相同的节奏。玛丽首先开口，缓慢而温柔，确保每个字都能传达。

"Have you gotten used to living alone in the apartment? I've noticed you're eating less." Genuine concern laced Maris words, a rare sight Asuka never saw much of. Then again, it would help to stop avoiding Mari in the first place.  
“你已经习惯一个人住在公寓里了吗？我注意到你吃得少了。”玛丽的话语中夹杂着真切的关心，这是明日香很少见到的。不过，如果她能不再回避玛丽，或许会有所帮助。

"I'm fine. I just...haven't been hungry lately."  
“我没事。只是……最近没什么胃口。”

"I know I'm not that good of a chef, but you can always come over and have dinner with me. I would love your company."  
"我知道我厨艺不怎么样，但你随时可以来我家吃晚饭。我很欢迎你的陪伴。"

A thick uneasiness followed Mari's words, as if they were meant as a cruel and sadistic joke. But Asuka knew her partner enough to recognize the honesty behind the words, and the soft brush of fingers on the nape of her neck confirmed that the intent was just for her. _I would love your company._ Asuka didn't speak again. What was she supposed to say?  
玛丽的话带着一种浓重的不安，仿佛是一场残酷而变态的玩笑。但明日香足够了解她的伴侣，能察觉到话语背后的真诚，以及颈后轻柔的指尖触感，确认这份邀请只属于她。我很欢迎你的陪伴。明日香没有再说话。她该说什么呢？

Mari expected the lack of an answer. But then the grip at her waist tightened and she knew. N_o one has ever opened up to her like this before._ Mari chuckled and pressed her cheek harder against Asukas. They had begun to move harmoniously.  
玛丽预料到了没有回应。但随后腰间的握力收紧，她明白了。从未有人像这样向她敞开心扉。玛丽轻笑一声，将脸颊更紧地贴在明日香的脸上。她们开始和谐地移动。

"You're getting the hang of it, Princess." Mari whispered into Asukas ear again, this time her voice coming out huskier than it normally would. She always got off testing her restless partners patience.  
"你开始上手了，公主。" 玛丽再次低声在明日香耳边说道，这次她的声音比平时更加沙哑。她总是喜欢考验她那不安分的伴侣的耐心。

"Stop doing that." The other ordered with annoyance.  
"别再那样了。" 对方带着恼怒命令道。

"Stop what?" Sarcasm rode along with the brunettes melodic accent.  
"别再什么？" 讽刺伴随着这位棕发女子的悦耳口音而来。

"THAT. Stop talking into my ear. Its weird."  
“那个，别对着我耳朵说话，怪怪的。”

Clearly Asuka meant the opposite in Maris mind, so the latter disregarded the remark and pulled the redhead even closer, continuing the offense. "You would love doing it. Give it a try someday."  
在真希波看来，显然明日香说的是反话，于是她无视了这句评论，反而将红发少女拉得更近，继续进攻。“你会喜欢的，哪天试试看吧。”

Asuka's face flustered. The unexpected pleasure that she got from having her hips pressed against Maris was very troubling. Sure, they were the two most dysfunctional partners in existence and the messed up, shaky connection that comes with that was present, but she didn't have it planned to feel _physically_ attracted to Mari, or girls for that matter. It just happened, as if to enhance her joyous life even further. She couldn't stop herself from secretly observing Maris toned body in the showers, reveling in her rhythmic, often sensual voice, and god, loosing herself in Maris eyes for those rare and sparse seconds. How she would love to _control_ them.  
明日香的脸颊泛起了红晕。被真希波的臀部紧贴所带来的意外快感让她十分困扰。没错，她们是世上最不和谐的一对搭档，那种混乱而摇摆不定的联系确实存在，但她从未打算对真希波或任何女孩产生身体上的吸引。这一切就这么发生了，仿佛是为了让她的快乐生活更加丰富多彩。她无法阻止自己偷偷观察真希波在淋浴间里线条分明的身体，沉醉于她那富有节奏、常常充满感性的声音，还有，天哪，在那稀少而珍贵的几秒钟里迷失在真希波的眼眸中。她多么希望能掌控这一切。

Asuka shut her eyes tight to try and banish the foolish thoughts, though she didn't have much time before Mari spoke again. "Don't worry, I'll lead." A new melodic song started to play; its soothing ambiance and hypnotic beat surrounded them both in a fragile shroud of affection.  
明日香紧紧闭上眼睛，试图驱散那些愚蠢的念头，但没过多久，真希波再次开口。“别担心，我来带路。”一曲新的旋律开始播放；它那抚慰人心的氛围和催眠般的节奏将两人包裹在一份脆弱的温情之中。

_"You lift my heart up  
“你将我的心托起”_  
_when the rest of me is down"  
当我的其余部分沉沦”_

Mari pressed her hands onto the contour of Asuka's hips, gripping just enough to slightly manipulate them. She began to press against her partner with an obvious sensuality that wasn't there before. Asuka in return held onto Mari's neck for balance, embarrassingly trying to keep up with the new beat. Right, left, up, and down. It was all relatively easy; the problem was it felt too good.  
玛丽将双手按在明日香臀部的轮廓上，恰到好处地抓住，轻轻地调整着它们。她开始以一种之前未曾显露的明显性感压向她的伴侣。明日香则抓住玛丽的脖子以保持平衡，尴尬地试图跟上新的节奏。左右上下，一切都相对容易；问题在于感觉太好了。

_Fuck_. She placed her head on Mari's collar to ease her breathing, ignoring the fact that her brow was glistening with sweat again. Mari had her eyes closed, Asuka noticed. The thought of being subject to Mari's devote attention sparked something within her; it was a mix of both love and lust in which she couldn't distinguish one from the other, for she had never felt either one before.  
该死。她将头靠在玛丽的衣领上以缓解呼吸，忽略了额头上再次闪烁的汗水。玛丽闭着眼睛，明日香注意到了。被玛丽全神贯注地关注着的想法在她心中激起了一丝火花；这是一种爱与欲望的混合体，她无法区分其中之一，因为她从未感受过其中任何一种。

_You, you enchant me, even when you're not around  
你，你让我着迷，即使你不在身边_

As the music progressed so did the friction between the two; Asuka warmed Maris neck with raspy pants as the taller of the two openly ground against the Germans body with enough pressure to make the her sigh out of pleasure.  
随着音乐的推进，两人之间的摩擦也愈发激烈；Asuka 用沙哑的喘息温暖着 Maris 的脖颈，而较高的那一位则毫不掩饰地紧贴着德国人的身体，施加的压力足以让她因愉悦而叹息。

"Asuka..." Mari whispered aimlessly into the others hair. She snuck a hand up Asuka's thin back and raised the girl to plant a wet kiss on her neck. Asuka tried to hide the whimper but Mari's lips effortlessly caught the vibrations. Maris head rose and swoon in place with Asukas, as if trying to find the right set of skin at the right angle.  
“Asuka...” Mari 无意识地低语，声音消失在对方的头发中。她悄悄地将手伸向 Asuka 纤细的背部，将女孩抬起，在她的脖子上印下一个湿润的吻。Asuka 试图隐藏那声呜咽，但 Mari 的唇轻易地捕捉到了那些颤动。Maris 的头抬起，与 Asukas 一起陶醉地摇摆，仿佛在寻找那个角度下恰到好处的肌肤。

_If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down  
如果有界限，我会尝试打破它们_

_I'm latching on babe, now I know what I have found  
宝贝，我紧紧抓住了，现在我知道我找到了什么_

Shikinami felt Maris weight against her so strong that her presence was all she could bare to feel. The small details of Maris soft skin, her strong,musky scent, and hungry body formed an assimilating trance. The night, and the people inside the disco and the changing lights and the past pain of the shards in her hand. Everything led to her and encapsulation made each move more intense, every thrust more pleasurable then the one before. Mari's grip kept tightening until everything seemed to be speeding up to something. Asuka slightly frowned at that heavy chill creeping up in her lower feeling continued to rise and accumulate and crash into her until the song suddenly hit its culmination and she was swiftly raised to meet Mari's lips.  
式波感觉到真希波的重量压在她身上，如此强烈以至于她的存在是她唯一能承受的感觉。真希波柔软的皮肤、她那强烈而麝香的气息，以及她饥饿的身体，形成了一种同化的恍惚状态。夜晚、迪斯科里的人们、变幻的灯光，以及她手中碎片的过去痛苦。一切都导向她，封装使每一个动作更加激烈，每一次冲刺都比前一次更愉悦。真希波的握力不断收紧，直到一切似乎都在加速向某个目标。明日香微微皱眉，那种沉重的寒意在她体内蔓延，感觉不断上升、积累并冲击着她，直到歌曲突然达到高潮，她被迅速抬起，迎向真希波的唇。

_I feel we're close enough  
我感觉我们足够亲近了_  
_I want to I lock in your love  
我想将你的爱锁定_

She was so close. Even with shut eyes she could feel the faintest touch of her partners lips.  
她离得如此之近。即便闭上眼睛，她也能感受到伙伴唇间最轻微的触碰。

_I think we're close enough  
我想我们已经足够亲近了_  
_Could I lock in your love baby  
宝贝，我能锁定你的爱吗_

All she had to do was close them around Mari's when, in a cruel twist of fate, the music suddenly ended. The distorted sound of the Djs voice filled the room as both Asuka and Mari softened their grips on each other and slowly opened their eyes. Whatever had achingly built up in her chest was exhaled with a bitter taste.  
她只需在命运残酷的转折中，在音乐突然结束时，紧紧握住麻里的手。DJ 扭曲的声音充斥着房间，明日香和麻里都放松了彼此的握力，缓缓睁开眼睛。她胸中那股令人心痛的情感，带着苦涩的味道被呼出。

Asuka's marine blue orbs showed she still was recovering from the dancing frenzy, whilst Mari's displayed the same, if not something deeper than the obvious frustration, something that seemed dangerous and soul devouring and heartwarming at the same time. Could it be l-? Maris breathing was still quick when she smiled again. "Dont worry Asuka," she started, cradling one of the girls cheek in her palm. It's shaking, Asuka thought. "Next time you'll get the kiss from the Prince. I promise."  
明日香那海蓝色的眼眸显示出她仍在从舞蹈的狂热中恢复，而麻里的眼神同样如此，如果不是更深层次的挫败感，那似乎是一种危险、吞噬灵魂又令人心暖的东西。难道是——？麻里再次微笑时，呼吸依然急促。“别担心，明日香，”她开始说，手掌轻托着女孩的脸颊。它在颤抖，明日香想。“下次你会从王子那里得到吻。我保证。”

Asuka just looked down at Mari's black converse shoes. "Whatever."  
明日香只是低头看着真希的黑匡威鞋。"随便吧。"

"Hey common now, no need to be so gloomy.", Mari said, cocking her head to try and see past the red haired bangs. She was just about to lift Asuka's chin when an interesting sight caught her attention. "Misato?"  
"嘿，别这么阴沉嘛。"真希说着，歪头试图透过红发刘海看过去。她正要抬起明日香的下巴时，一个有趣的景象吸引了她的注意。"美里？"

The twenty-something, purple haired woman walked up to them with the stride of a drunken horse, grinning about some hidden cause with a Kaji not too far behind. "I see _someone_ lost the bet." Mari said to Misato while directing a hidden wink to Kaji. "Yeah, well, I'm not too daun because..." Misato paused, trying to regain her thoughts as she held onto Kajis shirt, "Ah, because Kaji here! thought I couldn't take the whole 7 shots!" She finished, raising only two fingers. "But you _did_ Misato. I'm so proud of you." Asuka frowned at Mari for rewarding the woman's obviously defective behavior. Kaji smiled and secured Misato at his side, already heading out. "Well girls, see you tomorrow. I can't let Misato drive by her own tonight. Remember, lunch at Ritsukos."  
二十多岁的紫发女子迈着醉马般的步伐向她们走来，脸上挂着某种隐秘原因的笑容，身后的加持也不远。"看来有人输了赌局。"真希对美里说，同时向加持偷偷眨眼。"是啊，不过我并不气馁，因为……"美里停顿了一下，试图理清思绪，手抓着加持的衬衫，"啊，因为加持这家伙！以为我喝不下那七杯酒！"她最后举起两根手指说道。"但你确实做到了，美里。我真为你骄傲。"明日香对真希奖励美里明显有问题的行为皱眉。加持微笑着将美里揽在身边，已经准备离开。"好了，姑娘们，明天见。今晚我可不能让美里自己开车。记得，中午在律子那里吃午饭。"

"I'm glad we have NERV's Operation Captain as our guardian, don't you?" Mari said with a hearty laugh. Asuka didn't find it as amusing but she gave a nod anyways. "I guess."  
"有 NERV 的作战部长做我们的守护者，你不觉得幸运吗？" 真希波爽朗地笑道。明日香并不觉得这有多好笑，但还是点了点头。"算是吧。"

The group slowly ended their slurred and overly-joyous conversations, said their goodbyes, and dissipated to their respectable homes. Asuka excused herself with the bartender for the broken cup and buttoned up her military coat with monotone precision. On the way out she saw the white puffs of heavy snowfall cover every road and tree. A figure at the door stood firmly with a pink umbrella. The person lifted it to reveal a wide smile. "Shall we go, Princess?"  
众人渐渐结束了他们含糊不清、过于欢快的对话，互道晚安后各自散去回家。明日香向酒保解释了打破杯子的事，然后以单调的精确动作扣上了军装外套的扣子。出门时，她看到厚重的雪花覆盖了每条道路和树木。门口站着一个打着粉色雨伞的身影，那人抬起伞，露出了灿烂的笑容。"我们走吧，公主？"

"But don't you live on the other side of the district?"  
"但你不是住在区的另一边吗？"

"Of course I do. But I thought I would walk you home anyways, _baka_." For some reason, Asuka didn't mind Maris use of her words. Maybe she was just too tired to care. Maybe.  
“当然会。不过我还是想送你回家，笨蛋。”不知为何，明日香并不介意真希波用她的词。也许她只是太累了，懒得计较。也许吧。

The two of them walked quietly through the park. The small crunches of stepped on snow turned into a hypnotic melody of sorts to Asuka, who had yet to feel some relief from the massive headache. The memories of the dance floor and Mari were still fresh and vivid, tumbling around inside Asuka's head; and yet everything seemed like a dream of pains and off-chance desires. It wasn't like Shikinami to give in to pleasure like that. It was all Makinamis fault.  
两人静静地穿过公园。脚下积雪的细微嘎吱声对明日香来说，变成了一种催眠般的旋律，她仍未从剧烈的头痛中得到一丝缓解。舞池和真希波的记忆依旧鲜活生动，在明日香脑海中翻滚；然而一切似乎都像是一场痛苦与偶然欲望交织的梦境。这样的放纵并不像式波的风格。这一切都是真希波的错。

Asuka almost slipped on a small patch of melted snow and cursed under her breath. Maris elbow bumped into her side. "Hey, hold on to me." The brunette urged eagerly. Asuka's first reaction would've been to fervently deny any notion of help. She was tipsy, not a damn cripple. But the remaining alcohol kicked in and tempted with crazy ideas.  
明日香差点在一片融化的雪地上滑倒，低声咒骂了一句。真希波的胳膊碰到了她的侧身。“嘿，抓住我。”棕发女孩急切地催促道。明日香的第一反应本会坚决拒绝任何帮助的念头。她只是微醺，又不是个该死的残废。但残余的酒精作祟，诱发了疯狂的想法。

Asuka, still looking ahead, wrapped a cautious hand around Maris arm and let it rest there. But her chest was aching for more, for that final piece of contact. Mari felt a head rest on her side and her heart swelled. She cast a tender smile and pulled her partner closer with the pure love one partner has for the other.  
明日香依旧目视前方，小心翼翼地用手臂环住真里的胳膊，让它停留在那里。但她的胸口渴望更多，渴望那最后的接触。真里感觉到一个头靠在了她的身侧，心中涌起一股暖流。她投以温柔的微笑，用纯粹的爱意将她的伴侣拉得更近。

Asuka felt an inexplicable happiness. She couldn't find the word for it, but at that moment she knew she wasn't alone in the darkness.  
明日香感到一种难以言喻的幸福。她找不到合适的词来形容，但在那一刻，她知道自己并不孤单地身处黑暗之中。
