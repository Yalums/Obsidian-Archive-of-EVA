**Germany 德国**

They were only a few days away from Christmas. Yui and her family were on a plane on their way to Germany.  
距离圣诞节只有几天时间了。结衣和她的家人正乘坐飞机前往德国。

The plane had just landed and was taxiing to the gate. At that time, Yui was looking out the window. Several years had passed since her last visit to Germany. At the time, her son was not yet in the world. Now he is three years old. She was happy about the invitation her friend had given her. Kyoko had persuaded her to come with her family.  
飞机刚刚降落，正在滑行至航站楼。那时，结衣正望着窗外。距离她上次访问德国已经过去好几年了。当时，她的儿子还未出生。如今他已经三岁了。她很高兴接受了朋友的邀请。京子说服了她带着家人一同前来。

When the plane stopped, the captain gave the signal that they could prepare to leave. They got dressed, exited the plane and headed for passport control.  
飞机停稳后，机长发出信号，指示他们可以准备下机。他们穿戴整齐，离开飞机，前往护照检查处。

"Welcome to Germany, have a pleasant stay" said the official handing Yui her passports. Yui walked through the gate carrying little Shinji in her arms and waited for her husband.  
“欢迎来到德国，祝您愉快”，官员递给 Yui 她的护照时说道。Yui 抱着小真嗣穿过闸门，等待她的丈夫。

After Gendo passed through the gate, they went to collect their luggage.  
在碇源堂通过闸门后，他们前去提取行李。

"Kyoko said her husband will pick us up. I'll finally get to see their baby girl in person. She's pretty in the pictures," she rubbed the cheek of a sleepy Shinji, "and you want to meet her too, Shinji?" The boy didn't answer, just rubbed his sleepy eyes.  
"Kyoko 说她丈夫会来接我们。我终于能亲眼见到他们的小女儿了。她在照片里很漂亮，"她轻抚着昏昏欲睡的 Shinji 的脸颊，"你也想见见她吧，Shinji？"男孩没有回答，只是揉了揉惺忪的眼睛。

Picking up their luggage, they made their way to the exit of the baggage room. As soon as they got out, they immediately recognized Kyoko's husband.  
他们拿起行李，向行李房的出口走去。一出来，他们立刻认出了 Kyoko 的丈夫。

"Hi guys, we haven't seen each other in a while. And that little handsome guy is Shinji, right?" The young man greeted his friends with a smile on his face.  
"嗨，伙计们，好久不见了。那个帅气的小家伙就是 Shinji 吧？"年轻人面带微笑地向朋友们打招呼。

"Yes, it's been a while since your wedding." Gendo shook the young man's hand.  
“是的，自从你婚礼后已经有一段时间了。”源堂握了握年轻人的手。

"Thanks for picking us up" Yui added.  
“谢谢你来接我们。”唯补充道。

"No problem. Kyoko is preparing food, and prefers that I don't disturb her in the kitchen. Please give me one suitcase and let's go."  
“没问题。绫子正在准备食物，她更喜欢我在厨房里不打扰她。请把一个行李箱给我，我们走吧。”

As they walked out of the airport terminal, a cold wind swept their faces. The air from their mouths turned to steam as they breathed. As Yui looked around, she noticed a small layer of snow on the sidewalk.  
当他们走出机场航站楼时，一阵寒风扑面而来。他们呼出的空气化作蒸汽。优看着四周，注意到人行道上覆盖着一层薄薄的雪。

"We haven't had snow at our place in several years. This will be Shinji's first snow, maybe there will be enough of it to play with" Yui said, looking down at Shinji falling asleep in her arms.  
“我们家已经好几年没下雪了。这将是真嗣第一次见到雪，也许会有足够的雪让他玩耍。”优说道，低头看着在她怀里睡着的真嗣。

"Don't worry about it, there's plenty of snow at our place. You'll see when we get there."  
“别担心，我们那儿雪多得很。等到了你就知道了。”

---

"Please come in." Kyoko's husband opened the door. He had barely entered the house when he heard his daughter running.  
"请进。" 响的丈夫打开了门。他刚进屋就听到了女儿跑来的声音。

"_Papa!_" shouted Asuka and ran to her dad's feet.  
"爸爸！" 明日香喊着，跑向她爸爸的脚边。

"Please say hello to our guests."  
"请向我们的客人问好。"

Little Asuka didn't even realize that her father said it to her in Japanese. She walked over to Shinji, who was standing next to his mom, holding her hand.  
小明日香甚至没有意识到父亲是用日语对她说的。她走到真嗣身边，他正站在他妈妈旁边，握着她的手。

"_Hi, I'm Asuka_" she said in German and held out her hand to the boy.  
“你好，我是明日香。”她用德语说道，并向男孩伸出手。

Shinji didn't understand what she said to him and just looked at her strangely.  
真嗣不明白她对他说了什么，只是奇怪地看着她。

"_He doesn't understand German honey._" Kyoko's husband tried to explain to his daughter which is why the boy didn't answer.  
"他不懂德语，亲爱的。" 京子的丈夫试图向女儿解释为什么那个男孩没有回答。

"_Is he stupid?_" Upon hearing the question, her father laughed.  
"他是不是很笨？" 听到这个问题，她的父亲笑了。

"_Oh, it's not nice to say that. No honey. Mom and I told you that our friends from Japan are coming,_ _r__emember?_" Asuka nodded. "_Speak in Japanese to him, okay?_" She nodded again.  
"哦，那样说可不好。不，亲爱的。妈妈和我告诉过你，我们的日本朋友要来，记得吗？" 明日香点点头。"用日语跟他说话，好吗？" 她又点了点头。

"Hi, I'm Asuka." This time she said it in Japanese.  
"你好，我是明日香。" 这次她用日语说道。

"I'm Shinji." He shook her hand.  
"我是真嗣。" 他握了握她的手。

Yui crouched down beside the girl and looked at her.  
Yui 蹲在女孩旁边，注视着她。

"You're prettier than the pictures your mom sent me."  
"你比妈妈发给我的照片上还要漂亮。"

Asuka blushed slightly at the comment, without saying anything.  
听到这话，明日香微微脸红，没有作声。

"Have our guests already arrived?"  
"我们的客人已经到了吗？"

Kyoko's voice came from the kitchen. She quickly came out of the kitchen and greeted her friends. She squatted beside Shinji and looked at him with a smile. The boy became slightly embarrassed and tried to hide behind his mom's legs.  
响子的声音从厨房传来。她迅速走出厨房，向朋友们打招呼。她蹲在真嗣旁边，微笑着看着他。男孩有些害羞，试图躲到妈妈的腿后。

"What a handsome son you have."  
“你有个这么帅气的儿子。”

Yui took a step to the side, revealing her son.  
优衣向旁边迈了一步，露出了她的儿子。

"Don't be shy, she's my friend. We'll stay here for two weeks."  
"别害羞，她是我朋友。我们会在这里待上两周。"

"Oh, don't worry. Asuka, take Shinji and go have some fun, okay?"  
"哦，别担心。明日香，带真嗣去玩玩吧，好吗？"

The girl nodded and, grabbing the boy's hand, led him into the living room.  
女孩点点头，抓住男孩的手，带他走进了客厅。

Kyoko grabbed Yui's hand and pulled her along.  
Kyoko 抓住 Yui 的手，拉着她一起走。

"And you guys, do whatever you like."  
“你们随意吧。”

After a short while, both ladies were in the kitchen. Yui did most things around the house and didn't want to take advantage of her friend's kindness.  
不久后，两位女士来到了厨房。Yui 在家中大多事情都亲力亲为，不想占朋友的便宜。

"Do you need help?" "需要帮忙吗？"

"No need, thank you. I'm finishing the last thing and it will be all done. How was your trip?"  
"不用了，谢谢。我正在完成最后一件事，马上就好了。你的旅行怎么样？"

"Good. The little one slept most of the way so there were no problems." Yui watched as her friend bustled around the kitchen. "Thank you for the invitation."  
"挺好的。小家伙大部分时间都在睡觉，所以没出什么问题。"" 由依看着她的朋友在厨房里忙碌。""谢谢你的邀请。"

"We should have met a long time ago. I wish Yuko had come, but I understand her. Divorce is not an easy thing to do. I don't understand why they are getting divorced. After all, they were trying to have a baby quite recently."  
"我们本该很久以前就见面的。我希望优子能来，但我理解她。离婚不是件容易的事。我不明白他们为什么要离婚。毕竟，他们最近还在努力要孩子。"

"She went to her parents in Hokkaido to get some peace. I think it will do her good."  
"她去了北海道的父母那里寻求一些平静。我想这对她有好处。"

"I told you to convince her to come." Kyoko noticed how Yui fell silent. It seemed obvious that Yui was troubled by something.  
"我告诉过你要说服她来。" 京子注意到优衣突然沉默了。显然，优衣被某件事困扰着。"

Yui sighed after seeing her friend's gaze.  
看到朋友的目光，优叹了口气。

"I didn't try to convince her because…don't tell her I told you," Kyoko nodded her head in understanding, "She told me why they were getting divorced."  
“我没有试图说服她是因为……别告诉她是我说的，”京子点头表示理解，“她告诉我他们为什么离婚。”

"She didn't tell me, and I didn't want to ask her directly." Kyoko wiped her hands on a cloth. She now turned to her friend and looked at her, waiting.  
"她没告诉我，我也不想直接问她。" 响子用布擦了擦手。她现在转向她的朋友，看着她，等待着。

"In fact, you gave the reason yourself. They were trying to have a baby, and it turned out that Yuko couldn't have children. I didn't want to persuade her to come because we're here with our husbands and children. It would have been awkward."  
"实际上，你自己已经给出了原因。他们正试图要个孩子，结果发现由子不能生育。我不想劝她来，因为我们这里都是和丈夫孩子一起。那会让她很尴尬的。"

"He's an asshole! Poor Yuko, you did the right thing." Kyoko sighed. "So, when will I call her Ayanami again?"  
"他真是个混蛋！可怜的由子，你做得对。" 响子叹了口气。"那么，我什么时候才能再叫她绫波呢？"

"Just after the new year, they are to be divorced."  
新年刚过，他们便要离婚。

"I can't imagine that my husband would leave me for someone else."  
"我无法想象我的丈夫会为了别人离开我。"

They spent a short while in the kitchen talking. The conversation consisted mostly of complaining about Yuko's soon to be ex-husband.  
他们在厨房里短暂地交谈了一会儿。对话主要围绕着抱怨由子即将成为前夫的那个人。

"I would like to go out for a walk with Shinji. The little one has never played in the snow. You know how it is in our country with snow."  
"我想和真嗣出去散个步。小家伙还从没在雪地里玩过呢。你知道我们国家下雪的情况。"

Kyoko looked at her watch. It wasn't particularly late, but the days were very short. On such days, snow was a comfort. The snow made it seem brighter outside. They still had a while before dinner so she could go with them.  
Kyoko 看了看她的手表。时间并不算晚，但白昼非常短暂。在这样的日子里，雪是一种慰藉。雪让外面看起来更明亮。他们还有一段时间才吃晚饭，所以她可以和他们一起去。

"We still have a while until dinner, why don't we all go? Tomorrow we can go with them for a longer time, and maybe we can take the sled then?"  
"我们还有一段时间才吃晚饭，为什么不大家都去呢？明天我们可以和他们一起去更长时间，也许到时候可以带上雪橇？"

"Sounds great." Before they left the kitchen, Yui asked her friend. "What song is playing on the radio? It's not Christmas song, but it's pretty."  
"听起来很棒。"在他们离开厨房之前，Yui 问她的朋友。"收音机里放的是什么歌？不是圣诞歌曲，但很好听。"

"Oh that? It's called _Somewhere Over the Rainbow_"  
“哦，那个啊？它叫《彩虹之上》”

---

It was quite frosty, though there was no wind. The snow seemed interesting to Shinji. It looked a little like the sand at the beach his mom used to take him to, but it creaked when he stepped on it. As he walked forward, he left footprints behind him. After a moment, he stopped and started looking to the side.  
虽然无风，但天气颇为寒冷。雪对真嗣来说显得很有趣。它看起来有点像他妈妈过去常带他去的沙滩上的沙子，但踩上去会发出嘎吱声。他向前走去，身后留下一串脚印。过了一会儿，他停下脚步，开始向旁边张望。

After catching up with Shinji, Asuka saw him staring at a pile of snow scattered by the road. She grabbed his hand and pulled him toward the pile of snow.  
追上真嗣后，明日香看到他正盯着路边一堆被风吹散的雪。她抓住他的手，拉着他朝那堆雪走去。

"It's soft and fluffy!" She pressed the boy's hand against the snow.  
"又软又蓬松！" 她将男孩的手按在雪地上。

Touching the snow with his own hand, he confirmed that she was right. It had a slight stickiness to his glove. He looked down at the girl and saw that she was forming something with both hands.  
他用自己戴着手套的手触摸雪，确认她说的没错。雪在他手套上留下了一点黏性。他低头看向女孩，发现她正用双手塑造着什么。

"It's a snowball." Asuka showed him the result of her work.  
"这是雪球。" 明日香向他展示了自己的作品。

He did the same. He grabbed some snow and made a small snowball. After making the snowball, he didn't know what to do with it next. Asuka came to his aid.  
他也照做了。他抓起一些雪，捏了个小雪球。捏好雪球后，他不知道接下来该拿它怎么办。这时，明日香过来帮忙了。

"Throw it there." “扔到那儿去。”

He did as she wanted, but his snowball didn't fly very far. Her snide face did not please him and he made another ball. This one landed not much further than the first.  
他按照她的要求做了，但他的雪球并没有飞得很远。她那嘲讽的表情让他很不爽，于是他又做了一个雪球。这个雪球落下的地方并不比第一个远多少。

"You can't throw." “你不会扔。”

She took a swing and threw the ball with all her might. This one fell closer than the snowballs thrown by the boy. When she heard her parents' light laughter, she turned red with embarrassment.  
她用力一挥，使出全身力气扔出了雪球。这个雪球比男孩扔的还要近。听到父母轻声的笑声，她羞得脸都红了。

When he saw the look on her face, he wanted to cheer her up somehow. He remembered that his mom had given him some cookies before flying out. He had one left over. It was a cookie stuffed with bean paste. After taking out the package with the cookie, he handed it to Asuka.  
当他看到她脸上的表情时，他想用某种方式让她振作起来。他记得妈妈在起飞前给了他一些饼干。他还剩一个。那是一个夹着豆沙的饼干。他拿出装有饼干的包装，递给了明日香。

"Here." “给。”

Her embarrassment was gone, and in its place was curiosity. She took the cookie from him and immediately tasted it. This taste was something new and unusual. It made her happy and she smiled at the boy.  
她的尴尬消失了，取而代之的是好奇。她从他手中接过饼干，立刻尝了一口。这种味道既新奇又特别。它让她感到开心，她对着男孩笑了。

"Come on kids, see the Christmas decorations and lights." The children turned toward Kyoko and nodded.  
“快来，孩子们，看看圣诞装饰和彩灯。”孩子们转向 Kyoko，点头表示同意。

They went to the market decorated for Christmas. There were various stalls set up in the square with food or Christmas items. The children enjoyed it, especially Shinji. He had never seen such colorful decorations. The smell of cinnamon and other spices was in the air. The adults bought themselves mulled wine and for the children, a warm beverage.  
他们来到了装饰一新的圣诞市场。广场上摆满了各式各样的摊位，有的卖食物，有的卖圣诞用品。孩子们玩得很开心，尤其是 Shinji，他从未见过如此五彩缤纷的装饰。空气中弥漫着肉桂和其他香料的气味。大人们为自己买了热红酒，给孩子们则准备了温暖的饮品。

They toured the various stands, and Asuka tried to explain various things Shinji had asked about. Not everything was familiar to her so her parents sometimes helped her.  
他们逛了各个摊位，Asuka 尝试解释 Shinji 提出的各种问题。并非所有事物她都熟悉，所以有时她的父母也会帮忙解答。

To Shinji, this place looked magical. Those sounds, colors and smells. It was almost overwhelming.  
对真嗣来说，这个地方宛如仙境。那些声音、色彩和气味，几乎让人难以承受。

One stall caught Yui's attention. At this stall, an elderly woman was selling handmade toys. One of them was a doll. The doll had red hair, a red simple dress, and eyes made of blue buttons. To Yui, this doll was similar to Asuka. She brought back a few gifts from Japan, but thought it wouldn't hurt to get one more, so she bought a doll and put it in her purse.  
一个摊位吸引了优的注意。在这个摊位上，一位老妇人正在售卖手工玩具。其中之一是一个娃娃。这个娃娃有着红色的头发，一件简单的红色连衣裙，以及用蓝色纽扣制成的眼睛。对优来说，这个娃娃与明日香颇为相似。她从日本带回了一些礼物，但觉得再多买一个也无妨，于是她买下了这个娃娃并放进了自己的手提包。

Watching the children enjoy themselves made a smile appear on Kyoko's face. Inviting Yui with her family was definitely a good idea. Evening was approaching, so they had to get back for dinner. Before going out for a walk, she took a carrot. She thought they could make a snowman on the way home, which the children would enjoy.  
看着孩子们尽情玩耍，京子脸上露出了微笑。邀请优和她的家人一起来玩绝对是个好主意。傍晚临近，他们得回家吃晚饭了。出门散步前，她拿了一根胡萝卜。她想他们可以在回家的路上堆个雪人，孩子们一定会很开心。

"It's getting late, let's go home for dinner. We can make a snowman on the way."  
“天色不早了，我们回家吃晚饭吧。路上可以堆个雪人。”

"Yay!" The children exclaimed joyfully.  
“耶！”孩子们欢呼雀跃。

Gendo sighed, for he knew full well that it would fall on him to make the snowman. Without waiting for his wife's command, he began to form a small ball. After it was formed, he began to roll it. He called out to his son to help him. The boy tried to help his dad, but it was actually Gendo who pushed the ball because it was already too heavy for the boy.  
源度叹了口气，他深知堆雪人的重任将落在自己肩上。不等妻子吩咐，他便开始制作一个小雪球。成型后，他开始滚动它。他呼唤儿子来帮忙。男孩试图协助父亲，但实际上是源度在推动雪球，因为它对男孩来说已经太重了。

Kyoko's husband was making a second ball with Asuka. Once the ball was large enough, he picked it up and placed it on top of the one Gendo had prepared. As he did so, he set about forming the last ball, which would be the head for the snowman.  
京子的丈夫正和明日香一起制作第二个雪球。当雪球足够大时，他将其抬起并放在源度准备好的那个雪球上。与此同时，他着手制作最后一个雪球，这将是雪人的头部。

At this time, Yui was looking for branches to use as hands for the snowman. When all the balls were on, she handed one branch each to the children.  
此时，Yui 正在寻找树枝作为雪人的手臂。当所有雪球都堆好后，她将一根树枝分别递给了孩子们。

Gendo lifted Shinji so that he could stick the branch into the snowman. Asuka's father did the same.  
源堂将真嗣举起，让他能把树枝插进雪人里。明日香的爸爸也做了同样的事。

At the end, Kyoko went over to the children and gave them a carrot and two stones so they could make a face for the snowman. She picked up first her daughter and then the boy.  
最后，Kyoko 走到孩子们身边，递给他们一根胡萝卜和两块石头，让他们为雪人做一张脸。她先是抱起自己的女儿，然后是那个男孩。

"Stand by the snowman kids, I'll take a picture of you." Kyoko took the camera she had brought with her and took a picture of the children.  
“站在雪人旁边，孩子们，我给你们拍张照。”Kyoko 拿起她带来的相机，给孩子们拍了张照片。

"You two look beautiful together." Yui smiled as she saw the children standing in front of the snowman, holding hands.  
“你们俩站在一起真好看。”Yui 笑着看到孩子们站在雪人前，手牵手。

"Okay, let's go home and try my cooking."  
“好了，我们回家尝尝我的厨艺吧。”

---

When they got home, the children were playing in the living room and Gendo and Mr. Langley were sitting by the fireplace drinking beer.  
当他们回到家时，孩子们正在客厅玩耍，而源堂和兰利先生则坐在壁炉旁喝着啤酒。

Asuka was very happy to have a playmate. She wasn't always able to say what she meant in Japanese, yet it was still pleasant to play with him. As she played, she remembered that she had gingerbread that her dad had given her earlier. She quickly ran to her room and brought back the soft gingerbread. It was a round cookie, a little bigger than her hand.  
明日香非常高兴有个玩伴。她并不总能用日语准确表达自己的意思，但和他一起玩仍然很愉快。玩耍时，她想起了爸爸之前给她的姜饼。她迅速跑回房间，拿来了那块柔软的姜饼。这是一个圆形的饼干，比她的手稍大一些。

"Here." She handed the gingerbread to the boy.  
“给。”她把姜饼递给了男孩。

The smell of gingerbread reminded him of the stalls they had seen. He saw that the girl had only one piece so he tried to break it in half. He succeeded. With satisfaction, he handed half of it to Asuka.  
姜饼的香味让他想起了他们见过的摊位。他注意到女孩只有一块，于是尝试将其掰成两半。他成功了。满意地，他将一半递给了明日香。

She nodded and they ate the sweet together.  
她点点头，他们一起品尝了这份甜食。

"Is it good?" “好吃吗？”

After Shinji nodded, she came up with an idea.  
在真嗣点头后，她想出了一个主意。

"Would you like more?" “你还想要更多吗？”

"Yes"

"I can get some. Will you promise me something?"  
“我可以去拿一些。你能答应我一件事吗？”

"What?" "什么？"

She leaned over the boy and whispered something in his ear.  
她俯身靠近男孩，在他耳边低语了几句。

The boy didn't really know what she meant, but he agreed.  
男孩并不完全明白她的意思，但还是同意了。

At this, Asuka got up and ran to the kitchen.  
听到这话，明日香起身跑向厨房。

---

Yui and Kyoko had a lot to tell each other. They finished making dinner while talking in the kitchen.  
Yui 和 Kyoko 有很多话要互相倾诉。她们一边在厨房里聊天，一边完成了晚餐的制作。

"When does Yuko have her contact experiment?" Kyoko turned to face Yui.  
"优子什么时候进行她的接触实验？" 京子转向面对优。

"We have postponed the experiment. We will have a test both at the same time. You can probably guess the reason."  
我们已推迟了实验。我们将同时进行两项测试。你大概能猜到原因。

Yui made a sad face.  
优依露出了悲伤的表情。

"Is it because of the divorce?"  
“是因为离婚吗？”

Yui merely nodded. Yuko's experiment was supposed to be the first, but because of the divorce, the girl was living under a lot of stress.  
优依只是点了点头。由子的实验本应是第一个，但由于离婚，女孩承受着巨大的压力。

"You were supposed to supervise Yuko's experiment."  
"你本该监督优子的实验。"

"Dr. Akagi is more than capable of overseeing the experiment."  
"赤城博士完全有能力监督这项实验。"

Kyoko sighed. She didn't have a good relationship with Doctor Akagi. For some reason, something about the doctor didn't sit well with her. She thought she was hiding something. It seemed to her that the woman had an ulterior motive.  
京子叹了口气。她和赤城博士的关系并不好。不知为何，这位博士总让她感觉不舒服。她觉得博士隐藏了什么。在她看来，这个女人似乎别有用心。

"Do you have a date yet?"  
“你已经约好人了吗？”

"According to the schedule, we should conduct the experiment at the end of February. We'll do the test together, Yuko in the prototype and me in the test type. I heard that you guys are behind schedule. A week or something around that?"  
"按照计划，我们应该在二月底进行实验。由我来操作原型机，优子操作测试机型。我听说你们进度落后了，大概一周左右？"

"Probably two weeks." A sigh could be heard from Kyoko's side. After a while, she got an idea. "What would you say to a short vacation after experiment?"  
"可能两周吧。" 从京子那边传来一声叹息。过了一会儿，她想到了一个主意。"实验结束后，你觉得来个短途旅行怎么样？"

"Maybe. I can see that Shinji is enjoying the trip here."  
"或许吧。我看真嗣在这里玩得很开心。"

"No, no. I'm talking about a girls' night out. Just the three of us. We'll leave the kids with the husbands. We could use a break. Maybe Ayanami will meet someone?" Kyoko let out a little wink.  
"不，不。我说的是女生之夜。就我们三个。把孩子留给丈夫们。我们该放松一下了。也许绫波会遇到谁呢？" 绫子眨了眨眼。

A smile appeared on Yui's face. After the wedding, she spent time mostly with her husband and son, even at work. Maybe such an outing is not a stupid idea? One thought did not give her peace of mind.  
由依脸上露出了微笑。婚礼后，她大部分时间都和丈夫及儿子在一起，甚至在工作中也是如此。也许这样的外出并不是个坏主意？有一个念头让她无法安心。

"I don't know. My husband can be so...distracted sometimes. What if he leaves my son at the station or something?"  
"我不知道。我丈夫有时会心不在焉。万一他把儿子落在车站什么的怎么办？"

"Aren't you exaggerating too much?" laughed Kyoko, but Yui was somewhat right. Kyoko knew Gendo poorly, but he seemed perpetually thoughtful.  
"你是不是有点夸张过头了？" 笑道京子，但结衣说得也有几分道理。京子对源堂了解甚少，但他似乎总是深思熟虑。

"Maybe you're right. Why don't you propose something? I'll talk to Yuko when I get back."  
"也许你是对的。你为什么不提个建议？我回去后会和由子谈谈。"

"Sure." "当然可以。"

At that moment, Asuka rushed into the kitchen. She ran up to her mother and gave the impression that something was wrong.  
就在那一刻，明日香冲进了厨房。她跑到母亲跟前，给人一种出事了的感觉。

"What's wrong, honey?" “怎么了，宝贝？”

"Nothing Mommy. Can I have some gingerbread? Please!"  
“没事，妈妈。我可以吃些姜饼吗？求你了！”

"We're about to eat dinner, you'll eat the candy later."  
"我们正要吃晚饭，你待会儿再吃糖吧。"

The girl protested. She absolutely wanted to get gingerbread for Shinji.  
女孩抗议道。她绝对想为真嗣买姜饼。

"It's not for me, it's for Shinji!"  
"不是给我，是给真嗣的！"

Seeing how determined her daughter was, she decided to fulfill her request. She opened the cupboard and took out a package of gingerbread, from which she took out two pieces of. Before she gave them to her daughter, however, she wanted to ask what it was about.  
看到女儿如此坚决，她决定满足她的请求。她打开橱柜，取出一包姜饼，从中拿出两片。然而，在递给女儿之前，她想先问问是什么原因。

"It's nice that you want to give Shinji a treat. Is it for that cookie he gave you on the walk?"  
“你想给真嗣一个惊喜，这很好。是因为他散步时给你的那块饼干吗？”

Asuka just shook her head which slightly surprised her mom.  
明日香只是摇了摇头，这让她的妈妈略感惊讶。

"I want to give him gingerbread, it's important!"  
"我想给他姜饼，这很重要！"

Kyoko didn't know what it was about, but she gave her daughter what she asked for.  
京子虽然不知道为什么，但还是按照女儿的要求做了。

Satisfied, Asuka immediately ran out of the kitchen  
心满意足的明日香立刻跑出了厨房

Kyoko turned toward her friend.  
Kyoko 转向她的朋友。

"Do you understand any of this?"  
“你明白这些吗？”

"I have no idea," Yui just shrugged her shoulders, "I'm glad our kids are getting along and having fun."  
“我完全不懂，”Yui 只是耸了耸肩，“很高兴我们的孩子们相处融洽，玩得开心。”

Kyoko smiled and let out a slight giggle. After making sure dinner was ready, Kyoko began to collect the plates.  
Kyoko 微笑着，发出轻微的笑声。确认晚餐准备妥当后，Kyoko 开始收拾盘子。

"Okay, the dinner is ready and we can take it to the dining room."  
“好了，晚餐准备好了，我们可以把它端到餐厅去。”

When the food was on the table, Kyoko was able to call everyone over for dinner.  
当食物摆上桌后，Kyoko 便招呼大家过来用餐。

"Dinner is ready! Please go get the kids."  
晚饭准备好了！请去叫孩子们过来。

At this point, the husbands started heading to the dining room, and Yui went to the living room to get the kids.  
此时，丈夫们开始向餐厅走去，而优衣则前往客厅去接孩子们。

"Dinner's on the table." “晚餐已经摆好了。”

As soon as Asuka heard Yui, she got up and started walking to the dining room.  
听到由美的话，明日香立刻起身，走向餐厅。

Shinji did the same, but was stopped by his mom before he left the room.  
真嗣也准备跟着去，但在离开房间前被妈妈拦住了。

"Hey honey, are you having fun with Asuka?"  
"嘿，宝贝，和明日香玩得开心吗？"

"Yes!" "开心！"

The boy looked very happy to play with the girl. It was a nice change. He didn't have much contact with other kids at home. She squatted down beside the child and wiped the leftover gingerbread chocolate from his mouth.  
男孩看起来和女孩玩耍得很高兴。这真是个美好的变化。他在家里很少有机会和其他孩子接触。她蹲在孩子旁边，擦掉了他嘴角残留的姜饼巧克力。

"Did you enjoy the gingerbread?"  
"你喜欢姜饼吗？"

"Yes!" "喜欢！"

"That's good. Did you ask her for gingerbread?"  
"那就好。你向她要姜饼了吗？"

The boy shook his head.  
男孩摇了摇头。

"She gave me a gingerbread and asked if I wanted more. She said that if I promised her something, she would bring more."  
“她给了我一块姜饼，问我是否还想再要。她说如果我答应她一件事，她会带更多来。”

Yui smiled. She wondered what they were playing and what her son could've promised.  
结衣微笑着。她好奇他们在玩什么，她的儿子又许下了什么承诺。

"Will you tell me what you promised her?"  
“你能告诉我你答应了她什么吗？”

"I don't know." He shrugged his shoulders.  
“我不知道。”他耸了耸肩。

"Sweetie, you shouldn't make promises you don't want to keep. It's not nice. You should apologize to her."  
"亲爱的，你不应该做出你不想遵守的承诺。这不好。你应该向她道歉。"

"But I will keep my promise!" Shinji protested and stomped his foot.  
"但我一定会遵守我的承诺！" 真嗣抗议道，跺了跺脚。

"How are you supposed to keep a promise when you don't even know what you promised?" She sighed, looking at her son with pity. "Come to dinner."  
"你连自己承诺了什么都不知道，怎么可能遵守承诺呢？" 她叹了口气，怜悯地看着她的儿子。"来吃晚饭吧。"

Shinji grew sad. His mother was right when she said he would have trouble keeping his promise. As they walked to the dining room, Shinji pulled his mother by the leg.  
真嗣变得悲伤起来。他母亲说得没错，他确实难以守住自己的承诺。当他们走向餐厅时，真嗣拉着母亲的腿。

"Mommy, what is a fiancé?"  
“妈妈，什么是未婚妻？”

Notes: 注释：

The short story is an entry for the Asushin Discord Winter Contest. I recommend checking out this server. This is the raw version, with no changes after the contest.  
这篇短篇小说是 Asushin Discord 冬季比赛的参赛作品。我推荐大家去这个服务器看看。这是比赛后的原始版本，未经任何修改。

The timeline is shifted a bit in this story. I wanted the children to be at least 3 years old. I wasn't quite sure what I actually wanted to tell in this story. It was supposed to be a loose conversation between friends with children in the background. In their conversation I added the character of Ayanami, their friend. The thought occurred to me that since EVA 01 and 02 have souls (or part of a soul) shouldn't EVA 00 also have one? The name was chosen for a reason. A suggestion that Gendo has some heart left and gave Rei the name of his wife's friend.  
故事中的时间线稍有调整。我希望孩子们至少有 3 岁。我原本不太确定想在这篇故事中表达什么。它本应是一场朋友间的随意对话，孩子们在背景中嬉戏。在他们的对话中，我加入了绫波这个角色，作为他们的朋友。我想到，既然 EVA 01 和 02 拥有灵魂（或灵魂的一部分），那么 EVA 00 是否也应该有一个呢？这个名字是有原因的。暗示着碇源堂心中尚存一丝温情，将妻子的朋友的名字赋予了绫波。

There are also a few references to later events in the story, but I didn't expand on that. This probably makes the story feel a bit cut off. I don't know if I'll fix it in the future or use parts of it in another story.  
文中也提及了一些后续情节，但我并未深入展开。这或许让故事显得有些突兀。我不确定将来是否会修正，或是将其部分内容用于另一篇故事中。
