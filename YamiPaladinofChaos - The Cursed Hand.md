_There they were again. The silver haired, golden eyed boy with dog ears, the kind looking schoolgirl, the boy-fox, and the beautiful woman with sad brown eyes and raven hair...  
他们又出现了。银发金眼的犬耳少年，和善的校园女孩，狐狸男孩，还有那位美丽却带着悲伤棕色眼睛和乌黑长发的女子……_

_Today it was at a clearing in the middle of a thick forest that couldn't possibly exist post Impact, in front of a very old looking temple. He lay, unable to move, in the grass of an enormous crater, where a grave lay at the center.  
今天是在一片密林中的空地上，这片森林在冲击后不可能存在，面前是一座看起来非常古老的寺庙。他躺在巨大弹坑的草丛中，动弹不得，弹坑中央有一座坟墓。_

_There were lights, gathering in front of an old temple, faces of evil and creatures from nightmare within those shining lights.  
灯光聚集在古老的寺庙前，那些闪烁的光芒中，是邪恶的面孔和噩梦中的生物。_

_The dog boy was fighting an old man, chained by oversized beads as he stared down the lights.  
狗男孩正与一位被巨大念珠束缚的老人搏斗，他凝视着灯光。_

_Desperation set in his soul, and he would not let his friends die today.  
绝望侵蚀着他的灵魂，他决不允许朋友们今日丧命。_

_Standing resolutely, he raised his right hand, clutching it, and knowing he would die.  
他坚定地站立，举起右手紧握，明知自己将死。_

"_KAZAANA!"_ "卡赞娜！"

---

Shinji Ikari shot straight up in his bed, panting loudly as he felt cold sweat drip down his back. Shaking, he brought the back of his hand up to his forehead and wiped the sweat off his brow.  
碇真嗣猛地从床上坐起，大口喘息着，感觉冷汗顺着背脊滑落。他颤抖着，将手背举到额前，擦去眉间的汗水。

Unconsciously, he brought his right palm up until it was illuminated by the moonlight, just in front of his face. There was the faintest outline of a circle, a circle of darkness that he had only known once, at the hands of the Twelfth Angel.  
无意识地，他将右手掌举起，直到月光照亮了它，就在他的脸前。掌心隐约可见一个圆圈，一个黑暗的圆圈，他只在第十二使徒那里见过一次。

It burned slightly, and if Shinji closed his eyes, he could even feel the faint whispers of the wind radiating off of it.  
它微微发热，如果真嗣闭上眼睛，他甚至能感受到从它散发出的微风中的轻声细语。

They had been coming in more and more, vivid and realistic fantasies, sometimes intense battles like this, sometimes silly, innocuous images that made no sense.  
这些幻想越来越频繁地出现，生动而逼真，有时是像这样激烈的战斗，有时则是一些荒谬无害的画面，毫无意义。

And at times, rather inappropriate ones, of groping various women, specifically a black haired woman in old, traditional clothing. He could even almost feel the slaps, which held power that rivaled Asuka's.  
有时，甚至是不太合适的幻想，比如对各种女性进行摸索，特别是那位穿着古老传统服饰的黑发女子。他几乎能感觉到那些巴掌，其力道足以与明日香相媲美。

Asuka... that was another problem Shinji had now, since the start of these dreams. His right hand, much to his horror, had become almost magnetically attracted to the redhead's... _behind_.  
明日香...这成了真嗣现在面临的另一个问题，自从这些梦开始以来。他的右手，令他惊恐的是，几乎像被磁铁吸引一样，总是不由自主地伸向那位红发少女的...臀部。

His self control was at wits end and he wasn't quite sure if he could continue suppressing his hand's uncontrollable urge to caress Asuka's... _assets._  
他的自制力已经到了极限，他不太确定自己是否还能继续压抑住手那无法控制的欲望，去抚摸明日香...的曲线。

And if he couldn't, chances were that he would be able to determine who hit harder- the dream girl, or Asuka.  
如果他做不到，那么他可能会知道，究竟是梦中的女孩，还是明日香，打人更狠。

---

Asuka Langley Sohryu frowned as she watched Shinji Ikari bustle about the kitchen, doing his absolute best not to meet either her's or Misato's eyes- in fact, doing his best to maintain at least three feet from either of his female roommates.  
惣流·明日香·兰格雷皱着眉头，看着碇真嗣在厨房里忙碌，竭尽全力避免与她或美里对视——实际上，他尽量与两位女室友保持至少三英尺的距离。

Something was going on with the Third Child, and Asuka was nothing, if not curious (most would say nosy).  
第三适格者肯定有什么事瞒着，而明日香除了好奇（大多数人会说她爱管闲事）之外，别无其他。

As she opened her mouth to begin a scathing investigation, Shinji placed the rice and sausages he made for breakfast on the table, and then, in the blink of an eye, grabbed a handful of rice and a sausage and stuffed it in his mouth.  
正当她张嘴准备开始一番尖锐的盘问时，真嗣把他做的早餐——米饭和香肠——摆上了桌，然后眨眼间抓起一把米饭和一根香肠塞进了嘴里。

Before Misato or Asuka could question this strange behavior, the Third Child waved and managed a muffled "Bye!" as he ran out the door with all speed.  
在美里或明日香能质疑这种奇怪行为之前，第三适格者挥了挥手，勉强挤出一个闷闷的“再见！”便迅速跑出门去。

Misato blinked once, looked at her empty can of beer, and proceeded to grab another from the fridge. Without a word, she snapped it open and gulped it all down with one go.  
美里眨了眨眼，看了看手中空空的啤酒罐，然后从冰箱里又拿了一罐。她一言不发，啪地一声打开，一口气全灌了下去。

Asuka... Asuka was irritated.  
明日香……明日香感到烦躁。

---

"Asuka, what's the matter with you?" Hikari Horaki asked quietly, in the short break between classes. Her doe brown eyes were studying her friend intently, as if to discern the cause of the behavior.  
"明日香，你怎么了？" 在课间短暂的休息时间里，洞木光轻声问道。她那双鹿褐色的大眼睛专注地打量着她的朋友，仿佛要探寻出行为背后的原因。

"Huh?" the Second Child said distractedly, still puzzling over the Third Child's strange behavior. It could, after all, be good blackmail material.  
"啊？" 第二适格者心不在焉地应道，仍在琢磨着第三适格者奇怪的行为。毕竟，这可能是绝佳的敲诈材料。

"You've been staring at Shinji all morning like he's an alien with a giant green head," Hikari teased, stepping in front of her best friend lightly, staring her in the face. "So come on, spill it. What's going on?"  
"你整个早上都在盯着真嗣看，好像他是个长着巨大绿脑袋的外星人，" 洞木打趣道，轻盈地走到她最好的朋友面前，直视着她的脸。"所以快说吧，到底怎么回事？"

Asuka, deciding she could confide in her friend, leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, "That idiot's been acting weird today. It's bugging me."  
明日香决定向好友倾诉，便凑上前去，低声密语道：“那个白痴今天行为怪异，真让人心烦。”

"Aw, you're worried about him." Hikari said in a sickeningly sweet tone, batting her eyes in an exaggerated movement. "Isn't that sweet."  
“哎呀，你在担心他呢。” 光用甜得发腻的语气说道，夸张地眨了眨眼。“真甜蜜啊。”

"I'm not worried!" Asuka snapped defensively, crossing her arms in a huff. A few students stared at her, but most had learned that the temperamental girl was best left to her own devices. "It's just annoying, like he's hiding a secret from me."  
“我才不担心他！” 明日香急忙辩解，气呼呼地抱起双臂。几个学生朝她投来目光，但大多数人早已明白，这个脾气火爆的女孩最好别去招惹。“只是觉得他好像对我隐瞒了什么，真烦人。”

"Just why is it you have to know everything he's doing?" Hikari questioned, smirking a little. She just knew Asuka had to feel _something_ for her fellow pilot.  
"你为什么非得知道他的一举一动呢？" 光问道，嘴角微微上扬。她知道明日香对她的同僚飞行员肯定有某种感觉。

"Cause... he's a fellow pilot, and if he's doing something wrong, then that puts my ass in the fire!" Asuka said quickly, and glared at the Third Child's back, as though he was the cause of her discomfort.  
"因为...他是我的同僚飞行员，如果他做了什么错事，那我的屁股可就要遭殃了！" 明日香迅速回答，并瞪着第三适格者的背影，仿佛他就是她不适的根源。

"Sureee..." Hikari drawled mischievously, but said no more, merely continuing to look at her best friend with a knowing look.  
"当然啦..." 光调皮地拖长声音，但没有再多说，只是继续用一种了然的眼神看着她最好的朋友。

---

"Shinji, what's wrong with you?" Kensuke Aida said, annoyed as he watched the Third Child look utterly exhausted, again.  
"真嗣，你怎么了？" 相田剑介不耐烦地说，看着第三适格者再次显得极度疲惫。

"Seriously man, we're getting worried. You sleeping right, or is the she-devil keeping you up at night?" Touji Suzuhara joked, but the concern in his eyes was obvious.  
"说真的，哥们，我们开始担心了。你睡得好吗，还是那个女魔头让你晚上睡不着？" 铃原东治开玩笑地说，但他眼中的担忧显而易见。

"... dreams." Shinji said tiredly, rubbing his eyes and smacking his lips sleepily.  
"... 梦。" 真嗣疲惫地说，揉着眼睛，睡意朦胧地咂了咂嘴。

At once, Kensuke and Touji looked at each other, nodded, and grinned widely as they clapped the Third Child's shoulders, one on each side.  
当即，真希和东治互相对视一眼，点头后咧嘴大笑，分别拍了拍第三适格者的肩膀。

Shinji winced and his eyes snapped open from the force of their hands coming down on his back unexpectedly.  
真嗣被他们的手突然拍在背上吓了一跳，不由得皱眉，眼睛也猛地睁开了。

"Shinji, my man, welcome to puberty." Touji said proudly, laughing slightly.  
“真嗣，兄弟，欢迎来到青春期。”东治自豪地说道，略带笑意。

"You're well on your way to being a man now!" Kensuke added in, grinning as he pushed his glasses up from his nose.  
"你现在已经是个男子汉了！" 真希波补充道，咧嘴笑着，从鼻梁上推了推眼镜。

"Wha... what are you two talking about?" Shinji began, but his over excitable friends were too deep in their hyperbole now to listen.  
"什...你们俩在说什么呢？" 真嗣开口问道，但他那过于兴奋的朋友们此刻正沉浸在夸张的讨论中，根本没在听。

"So, which girl was it?" Kensuke asked curiously, leaning in, the glare of the sun reflecting off his glasses and shielding his eyes from view.  
"那么，是哪个女孩呢？" 真希波好奇地问，身体前倾，阳光从他的眼镜上反射，遮住了他的眼睛。

"Misato? Or Rei? Hell, the she-devil's alright in the looks, but you'd have to change her personality for her to be anything but a devil, even in a dream." Touji said, making sure to keep his voice low, as to not alert said redhead.  
"美里？还是丽？见鬼，那个女魔头长得倒是不错，但除非改变她的性格，否则在梦里她也不会变成天使。" 冬二说道，确保自己的声音保持低沉，以免引起那位红发女子的注意。

"What?" Shinji said, dumbfounded as he simply blinked and stared blankly.  
"什么？" 真嗣说道，目瞪口呆地只是眨眼和茫然地盯着。

"It's alright Shinji." Kensuke said comfortingly, patting his friend's shoulder supportively. "All guys have dreams like that."  
"没事的，真嗣。" 健介安慰地说道，拍了拍朋友的肩膀以示支持。"所有男生都会有那样的梦。"

"We do?" Shinji said blankly, weakly.  
"我们会的？" 真嗣茫然地说，声音微弱。

"Of course, it's natural to dream about a girl in... _intimate_ ways." Kensuke whispered, looking around warily.  
"当然，梦到女孩在... 亲密的方式是很自然的。" 健介低声说道，警惕地环顾四周。

Shinji, understanding (a bit late) what his best friends were talking to him about, flushed a deep crimson and felt his face begin to burn. "Guys! Not _that_ kind of dream!" he said hurriedly.  
真嗣，理解（有点迟）他的好友们在谈论什么，脸颊变得深红，感觉脸开始发烫。"伙计们！不是那种梦！" 他急忙说道。

"Then what kind of dream do you mean?" Touji questioned, looking rather bored as he crossed his arms behind his head.  
"那你指的是什么样的梦？" 冬二问道，看起来相当无聊，双手交叉枕在脑后。

"I dunno... I become this... guy, and I fight these demons along with a bunch of other people..." Shinji said slowly, shaking his head in confusion. "And afterward, or sometimes before, I keep... groping this one girl, who keeps slapping me."  
"我不知道... 我变成了这个... 家伙，和一群其他人一起对抗这些恶魔..." 真嗣缓缓地说，困惑地摇着头。"然后，或者有时之前，我总是... 对一个女孩动手动脚，她不停地扇我耳光。"

Kensuke and Touji stared at him for awhile, so much so that it began to make Shinji uncomfortable. Finally, Touji spoke.  
剑介和冬二盯着他看了一会儿，以至于真嗣开始感到不自在。最后，冬二开口了。

"I think the stress of being a pilot is getting to you, dude." Touji said, shaking his head in sympathy.  
“我觉得当驾驶员的压力让你有点吃不消了，伙计。” 冬二同情地摇了摇头说。

---

Asuka continued to watch the Third Child, increasingly getting frustrated as she watched him. It was... irritating, because nothing he did gave away anything other than him being a little sleep deprived.  
明日香继续观察着第三适格者，随着时间的推移，她越来越感到沮丧。这真是……令人恼火，因为他所做的一切除了显得有点睡眠不足外，什么也看不出来。

He would yawn, occasionally type something to one of his Stooge friends, or, upon failing that, look at the First Child for endless minutes.  
他会打哈欠，偶尔给他的某个跟班朋友发点什么，或者，如果不行的话，就盯着第一适格者看上没完。

It was that last activity that really started grinding into Asuka's thin patience.  
正是这最后一项活动，真正开始磨蚀着明日香那本就稀薄的耐心。

Honestly, if he was going to stare at a girl, he should stare at one that had a personality above... oh, a _rock._  
老实说，如果他打算盯着女孩看，至少应该选一个性格比……哦，石头强点的。

Her venomous (some would say jealous) glares, however, were doing little to affect the Third Child, and unless she wanted to risk a punishment by throwing something, she would have to wait until lunch to corner and confront her fellow pilot.  
然而，她那充满毒意（有人会说嫉妒）的瞪视，对第三适格者几乎毫无影响，除非她想冒险因扔东西而受罚，否则她只能等到午餐时才能堵住并质问她的同僚驾驶员。

Growling in frustration, Asuka clutched her pencil in a stranglehold, imagining it was the Third Child's neck.  
因沮丧而低声咆哮，明日香紧紧握住手中的铅笔，仿佛那是第三适格者的脖子。

Luckily for the pencil, the lunch bell rang out a few moments before the wooden instrument would have given out and broken.  
幸运的是，午餐铃在木制铅笔即将断裂之前几秒钟响起。

Almost immediately, Asuka pratically leapt up from her chair to confront the Third Child.  
几乎立刻，明日香几乎是从椅子上跳起来，准备面对第三适格者。

Fortunately for Shinji Ikari, his best friend's timely intervention, in the form of dragging the Third Child away to their usual lunch area, and Hikari's own interference by continuing to question Asuka allowed him to escape her wrath for the moment.  
幸好对于碇真嗣来说，他最好的朋友及时介入，以拖着第三适格者离开前往他们常去的午餐地点，以及光自己继续质问明日香的方式，让他暂时逃过了她的怒火。

---

Asuka scowled, and kicked the floor irritably. Not only had she failed to corner Shinji at school, but since it was her turn for clean up duty, she ended having to stay an extra amount of time and wasn't able to use the walk home to confront the Third Child.  
明日香皱眉，不悦地踢了踢地板。她不仅在学校没能堵住真嗣，而且因为轮到她值日打扫，结果不得不多留了一段时间，也没能利用回家的路途去面对第三适格者。

By the time she returned home, Shinji had already made and had his dinner, fed Pen Pen, and proceeded to go directly to sleep.  
等到她回到家时，真嗣已经做好了晚饭并吃完了，喂了企鹅 Pen Pen，然后直接去睡觉了。

Despite her nosy and dominating nature, Asuka did not like the idea of breaking into the Third Child's room. If not just because of the invasion and disregard of privacy it showed (which didn't matter all that much to her), then because of the fact that if she was caught in Shinji's room by Misato, her guardian would have ample blackmail material for weeks.  
尽管她有着爱管闲事且强势的性格，但明日香并不喜欢闯入第三适格者的房间这个主意。如果不是因为这种行为侵犯隐私且无视他人感受（这对她来说并不那么重要），那么就是因为如果被美里抓到她在真嗣的房间里，她的监护人将有足够的把柄来威胁她好几个星期。

Still... she wasn't here yet, and, if Asuka was lucky, Shinji would crack quickly enough.  
不过...她还没来，而且，如果明日香运气好的话，真嗣会很快屈服。

Quickly, quietly, she opened the door and slid it back in within a few seconds, slipping inside noiselessly.  
她迅速而安静地打开门，几秒钟内又将门滑回原位，悄无声息地溜了进去。

There, she found the room submerged in total darkness, the blinds drawn up, and the light snores of the room's occupant proving that Shinji was, in fact, sleeping.  
在那里，她发现房间完全沉浸在黑暗中，百叶窗紧闭，房间主人的轻微鼾声证明真嗣确实在睡觉。

Moving closer, she could barely discern his features as being oddly... happy, even joyous. A look she hadn't ever seen on Shinji's face before. If she was being honest, it was... _cute._  
她走近一些，勉强能辨认出他的面容显得异常...快乐，甚至喜悦。这是她以前从未在真嗣脸上见过的表情。说实话，这...很可爱。

Asuka shook her head and scowled. Now was not the time for hormones to be kicking up, especially around spineless little boys.  
明日香摇了摇头，皱起眉头。现在可不是荷尔蒙作祟的时候，尤其是在那些没骨气的小男孩周围。

As she moved forward, creeping ever closer, she began to hear words, mumbled under the Third Child's breath.  
随着她缓缓前进，越来越接近，她开始听到一些话语，被第三适格者低声咕哝着。

"... said..." "... 说..."

Her breath catching, Asuka grinned maliciously. This would be some _excellent_ blackmail material.  
她的呼吸一滞，明日香恶意地咧嘴一笑。这可是绝佳的勒索素材。

Moving closer and closer, the Second Child started to hear the words clearer.  
越靠越近，二号机开始更清晰地听到那些话语。

"... maybe... love... woman..."  
“……也许……爱……女人……”

_Huh?_ Asuka blinked, dumbfounded, and not a little bit uncomfortable now.  
嗯？明日香眨了眨眼，目瞪口呆，现在还感到有些不自在。

Shinji continued on, obviously oblivious to anything outside his dream.  
真嗣继续前行，显然对外界的一切浑然不觉。

Asuka was practically hovering above Shinji now, too engrossed in eavesdropping to care about anything else.  
明日香此刻几乎悬在真嗣上方，全神贯注于偷听，对其他事情毫不在意。

"... do you still want to marry me?"  
“……你还想娶我吗？”

Suddenly Asuka found herself, much to her horror, blushing hotly as she toyed with the idea of getting the Hell out of there versus the merits of staying.  
突然间，明日香发现自己惊恐地脸红得发烫，她纠结于到底是赶紧逃离这个鬼地方，还是权衡留下的好处。

Before she could decide, Shinji's words made the choice for her.  
在她做出决定之前，真嗣的话替她做了选择。

"I love you..." “我爱你……”

Something inside of Asuka, in that deadened part of her that her parent's divorce had wounded, that her mother's suicide had killed, began to awaken, warming her heart, past the bitterness.  
在明日香内心深处，那个因父母离异而受伤、因母亲自杀而死去的部分，开始苏醒，温暖了她的心，超越了苦涩。

"Sango." “珊瑚。”

Asuka thought she felt her heart wither and die.  
明日香觉得自己仿佛感到心在枯萎、死去。

Blankly, barely conscious of what she was doing, the Second Child stepped outside of the room, and tried to pretend that there weren't tears trying to claw their way out of her eyes.  
茫然地，几乎不知道自己在做什么，二号适格者走出了房间，试图假装没有泪水想要从她的眼中挣脱出来。

---

Shinji awoke feeling quite good, which was a rare occurrence for the morose Third Child. The dream he had wasn't about monsters or fighting or even doing anything perverted. This time, it had been him, talking with the beautiful woman in the dream.  
真嗣醒来时感觉相当不错，这对忧郁的三号适格者来说是个罕见的经历。他做的梦不再是关于怪物、战斗，甚至没有做任何变态的事情。这一次，梦中是他，与那位美丽的女子交谈。

He had been alone with her, talking and whispering, trying to say three simple words, to try and assure the girl that his feelings and his heart were hers.  
他独自与她在一起，交谈和低语，试图说出那三个简单的词，试图向女孩保证他的感情和心都属于她。

With a regretful, wistful sigh, he stood up to prepare breakfast. It was too bad he would never be able to find someone like that, or have the confidence to say such things.  
带着遗憾和怀念的叹息，他起身准备早餐。可惜他永远找不到那样的人，也没有勇气说出那样的话。

He was halfway done with the bacon and eggs when he heard the bathroom door open, and since he was fairly sure that the zombie-like sounds in Misato's room were his guardian's, he assumed it was Asuka.  
当他煎培根和鸡蛋做到一半时，听到浴室门开了，由于他相当确定美里房间里那僵尸般的声音是她的，所以他猜是明日香。

"Good-" Shinji began warmly, but suddenly a crimson blur raced past him and out the door, just as he managed "Morning." The end was rather listless and downcast, and Shinji frowned, wondering if he had done something to upset Asuka.  
“早——”真嗣热情地开口，但突然间，一团红色身影从他身边掠过，冲出门外，他只勉强说完“早上”。结尾显得相当无力且沮丧，真嗣皱起眉头，疑惑自己是否做了什么让明日香不高兴的事。

Figuring he would find out sooner or later (Asuka wasn't one to hide her displeasure), Shinji continued cooking.  
想着迟早会知道（明日香从不掩饰她的不悦），真嗣继续做饭。

The door to Misato's room slid open with a bang as the Major stumbled forward, yawning loudly, her hair an absolute fright as she moved toward the fridge.  
随着一声巨响，美里房间的门滑开了，少校踉跄着走进来，打着哈欠，头发乱得一塌糊涂，她朝冰箱走去。

Knowing that Misato was practically dead to the world before her first morning beer, Shinji waited for his errant guardian to swallow the entirety of her first dose of alcohol for the day, before greeting her.  
知道美里在喝早上的第一罐啤酒前几乎还处于半梦半醒状态，真嗣等他的这位不靠谱的监护人喝完她一天中的第一口酒后，才向她打招呼。

"Morning, Misato." Shinji said, a little bit less cheery, since Asuka had given him the complete cold shoulder package a few moments ago.  
“早上好，美里。”真嗣说道，语气略显低沉，因为几分钟前明日香对他完全不理不睬。

"Mornin, Shinji." Misato slurred, before her sleep dulled senses picked up a missing, familiar screech of annoyance. "Where's Asuka?"  
“早啊，真嗣。”美里含糊地回应，随后她迟钝的感官察觉到少了某个熟悉的恼怒尖叫声。“明日香呢？”

"She left as soon as she got out of the shower." Shinji said, at once concerned but grateful that there was no temptation to act upon the dreams.  
“她一洗完澡就出去了。”真嗣说道，既担忧又庆幸没有受到梦境中的诱惑。

"You two have a fight or somethin?" Misato asked blearily, wiping her eyes and yawning loudly, stretching her arms out.  
"你们俩吵架了还是怎么的？" 美里睡眼惺忪地问道，揉着眼睛，大声打了个哈欠，伸了个懒腰。

"No!" Shinji said defensively, placing the bacon and eggs down on the table.  
"没有！" 真嗣辩解道，把培根和鸡蛋放在桌上。

"Jeez... I was just asking." Misato chuckled, and proceeded to wolf down her breakfast at her usual voracious speed.  
"哎呀... 我只是问问嘛。" 美里笑了笑，继续以她一贯的狼吞虎咽速度吃着早餐。

---

Hikari blinked to make sure she wasn't dreaming. "Asuka? What are you doing at school so early?" she asked, knowing good and well that the redhead loathed this school with "the burning passion of a thousand white hot suns".  
光眨了眨眼，确保自己不是在做梦。“明日香？你怎么这么早就来学校了？”她问道，心里清楚得很，这位红发女孩对这所学校可是“恨之入骨，如同千百个炽热太阳般燃烧的激情”。

Her exact words, actually.  
实际上，这正是她的原话。

Asuka had a dead serious look in her eyes, which, combined with the fact that they were slightly red (though not from tears, no sir!), made her look even more imposing than usual. "Hikari, how many people at our school are named Sango?"  
明日香的眼神异常严肃，再加上她的眼睛微微泛红（当然不是因为流泪，绝不是！），让她看起来比平时更加令人敬畏。“光，我们学校有多少人叫珊瑚？”

Her voice was deadly serious, and those adjectives seemed quite literal.  
她的语气极其严肃，那些形容词似乎相当字面。

"Well... I think there's a Sango in class 2-B, and one that's a senior, but I can't remember which class..." Hikari began, before looking at her friend critically. "Why?"  
"嗯... 我想 2-B 班有一个叫珊瑚的，还有一个是高年级的，但我记不清是哪个班了..." 光开始说道，然后用批判的眼神看着她的朋友。"为什么问这个？"

"...No reason." Asuka said slowly, with a little bit of an edge to it.  
"...没什么。" 明日香缓缓说道，语气中带着一丝尖锐。

Asuka was on the edge of understanding... _something_, Hikari figured out, and decided that, no matter how difficult this might be, she would help her friend find out.  
明日香正处在理解的边缘...某件事，光认为，无论这有多么困难，她都会帮助她的朋友弄清楚。

On the other hand, the Second Child didn't know how she felt, at all. All she knew was that there was this sudden, violent possessive feeling toward the Third, and that she would make sure that Shinji Ikari remained her's with all the tenacity that she possessed.  
另一方面，二号适格者完全不知道自己的感受。她只知道，突然间对三号产生了强烈的占有欲，她会用尽自己所有的执着确保碇真嗣只属于她。

What this meant, Asuka wasn't sure.  
这意味着什么，明日香并不确定。

But she would not lose Shinji to this... _Sango_.  
但她绝不会让真嗣被这个...珊瑚夺走。

Because Asuka Langley Sohryu _never_ loses.  
因为惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不认输。

---

Rei Ayanami turned her attention away from the chirping birds and the rather bright sunlight to cast a single, corner of the eye look at the Third Child.  
绫波零将注意力从鸣叫的鸟儿和相当明亮的阳光上移开，用眼角瞥了一眼第三适格者。

He was acting... strange, and there was a distinct lack of focus and energy from him as of late, most likely due to lack of sleep.  
他的行为...很奇怪，最近明显缺乏专注和活力，多半是因为睡眠不足。

And since she, of her own free will, had decided that she would make his safety her highest priority, as long as it didn't interfere with Commander Ikari's orders of the Instrumentality Project.  
既然她自愿决定将他的安全置于最高优先级，只要这不与碇司令的‘人类补完计划’命令相冲突。

This behavior of his required investigation.  
他的这种行为需要调查。

The Second Child was rather hostile toward her, so Major Katsuragi would have to be the first avenue of information to try.  
二号机驾驶员对她颇为敌视，因此葛城美里少校将是首要的信息来源尝试对象。

---

Shinji frowned as he left the NERV locker rooms, giving off a deep sigh. The tests had run long today, mostly because Asuka and himself were not at their peak performance, earning them a severe tongue lashing from Ritsuko.  
真嗣皱着眉头离开 NERV 更衣室，深深地叹了口气。今天的测试拖得很长，主要是因为他和明日香状态不佳，结果被律子狠狠地训斥了一顿。

The dreams were really starting to bug him, Shinji realized, as he felt the urges of the dream spilling out into his waking hours.  
真嗣意识到，这些梦境真的开始困扰他了，他感觉到梦中的冲动正渗透到清醒时刻。

Still... Asuka was beginning to worry Shinji a little, if not because he (at times) could call her a friend, then because her anger usually meant pain for himself. She had been moody all the way over here, not saying a word to him and looking pointedly away from him.  
尽管如此... 真嗣开始有点担心明日香，如果不是因为他（有时）能称她为朋友，那么就是因为她的愤怒通常意味着自己会受苦。她一路上都情绪不佳，一句话也没对他说，还刻意避开他的目光。

"Penny for your thoughts?"  
“你在想什么呢？”

Shinji smiled a little and turned towards the eternally unshaven and casual speaker, Ryoji Kaji. "Hey Kaji."  
真嗣微微一笑，转向那位永远不修边幅、随性自在的说话者，加持良治。“嘿，加持。”

"You look like you could use a bit of advice there, kid." Kaji said, taking a slow drag of his cigarette, breathing out the smoke away from Shinji. "What's wrong? Those test scores seem awfully low."  
"你看起来需要一点建议，孩子。" 加持说着，缓缓吸了一口烟，将烟雾从真嗣的方向吹开。"怎么了？那些测试成绩似乎很低啊。"

"I'm... I'm just having some weird dreams, that's all." Shinji said quietly, slouching with his hands in his pockets. "Kensuke and Touji thought they were... _those_ kinds of dreams but they're not." He was blushing furiously at even referring to it.  
"我...我只是做了一些奇怪的梦，仅此而已。" 真嗣轻声说道，双手插在口袋里，显得有些颓废。"剑介和东治认为那是...那种梦，但并不是。" 他提到这些时脸红得厉害。"

"Dreams are a window into another world, Shinji." Kaji said mystically, in his usual light, wizened tone as he gestured outward with his cigarette in hand, leaving a trail of wispy smoke. "Maybe the stress of being a pilot is simply spilling into your unconscious hours."  
"梦是通往另一个世界的窗口，真嗣。" 加持神秘地说道，用他一贯轻松而睿智的语气，手中香烟向外一挥，留下一缕缕轻烟。"也许成为驾驶员的压力正渗透到你的潜意识中。"

"That's what Touji said." Shinji nodded, and sighed deeply. "They just... seem so real."  
"那就是冬二说的。" 真嗣点头，深深叹了口气。"它们看起来……太真实了。"

"Dreams, for whatever insight they may grant, are still just dreams, Shinji. Enjoy it, and remember to wake up at the end." Kaji said, finishing his cigarette, dropping it, and grinding it down with his heel. "I'll be seeing you around, kid."  
"梦境，无论能带来什么启示，终究只是梦境，真嗣。享受它，记得在最后醒来。" 加持说完，抽完烟，将烟蒂丢下，用鞋跟碾灭。"我们还会再见面的，孩子。"

---

Trying to keep Kaji's advice in his head and just let the dreams be, Shinji came to school the next morning, once again devoid of Asuka's usual dominating presence on the walk over.  
试图记住加持的建议，让梦境顺其自然，真嗣第二天早上来到学校，又一次在上学路上没有感受到明日香平日里的强势存在。

Last night's dream had been the most intense yet; he had been trapped, deep inside a mountain with the beautiful girl (whom he'd finally had a name- Sango), and they were facing down a horde of demons. She had screamed a name (he couldn't remember it, no matter how many times it was said), and begged him not to fight.  
昨晚的梦异常强烈；他被困在深山之中，与那位美丽的女孩（他终于知道了她的名字——珊瑚）一起，面对着一群妖怪。她尖叫着一个名字（无论重复多少次，他都记不住），恳求他不要战斗。

In desperation, he had confessed that life wouldn't be worth living if he couldn't protect her, and absorbed the demons with the Kazaana, that strange, black hole that lay in his hand.  
在绝望中，他坦白说如果不能保护她，生命将毫无意义，并利用风穴，那个奇怪的黑色洞穴，位于他的手中，吸收了那些妖怪。

That was the most disturbing part of every dream. After the dreams, he could sometimes feel the burning in his palm, like the actual Kazaana was inside, just waiting to burst free and suck demons and everything else into it.  
这是每个梦中最令人不安的部分。梦醒后，他有时能感觉到掌心的灼热，仿佛真正的风穴就在里面，随时准备爆发，将妖怪和一切吸入其中。

Strangely, it was also the hand that the urge to grope was springing up from.  
奇怪的是，这种摸索的冲动正是从这只手开始涌现的。

As he stepped inside of the classroom, he was suddenly and violently grabbed from behind, and pulled away from the classroom, and pushed against the wall.  
当他踏进教室时，突然被人从背后猛地抓住，拉离了教室，推到了墙上。

"Class Rep?" Shinji managed, feeling quite afraid as he stared down Asuka's best friend and the terrible wielder of the Ear Pull of Doom (noticeably and consistently used on one Touji Suzuhara).  
“班长？”真嗣勉强应道，看着明日香的好友、可怕的“揪耳神功”使用者（明显且一贯地用在铃原东治身上），感到相当害怕。

"Shinji, which Sango are you going out with?" Hikari demanded brusquely, placing her hands on her hips and glaring at him with impressive force.  
"真嗣，你和哪个珊瑚出去约会？" 光利索地问道，双手叉腰，用惊人的气势瞪着他。

And of course, Shinji withered underneath the pressure, faster than you could say "out with it". "What do you mean?" he asked shakily, his voice quivering.  
当然，真嗣在压力下迅速退缩，快到你还没来得及说“说出来”。“你什么意思？”他颤抖地问道，声音发颤。

"Don't play dumb with me!" Hikari snapped, crossing her arms over her chest. "I know all about this little relationship you've got!" she jabbed him in the chest with her index finger, and he winced.  
“别跟我装傻！”光厉声说道，双臂交叉在胸前。“我知道你这段小恋情的一切！”她用食指戳了戳他的胸口，他疼得皱眉。

"What are you talking about!" Shinji whined, rubbing his chest with another wince.  
"你在说什么啊！" 真嗣抱怨着，揉着胸口，又是一阵皱眉。

Hikari pressed on, heedless of his words. "Did you ever think about how Asuka might feel? Did you? Did you?" each question was punctuated with another jab to the chest.  
光不理会他的话，继续追问。"你有没有想过明日香会怎么想？你有没有？有没有？" 每一个问题都伴随着胸口的一次戳刺。

"What do you mean? I don't know any Sango-" Shinji froze, the words dying in his throat.  
"你什么意思？我不认识什么珊瑚——" 真嗣突然僵住，话音戛然而止。

Sango. The girl from the dream.  
珊瑚。梦中的女孩。

"Don't lie! Why else would Asuka be so upset!" Hikari said waspishly, frowning imperially down on him.  
"别撒谎！不然明日香怎么会这么生气！" 光子尖刻地说道，威严地皱眉俯视着他。

"Class Rep... Sango's the name of a girl in my dreams. That's all." Shinji said softly, shrugging his shoulders. "I'm not going out with her."  
"班长……珊瑚是我梦中的一个女孩的名字。仅此而已。" 真嗣轻声说道，耸了耸肩。"我没有和她交往。"

Hikari, quite adequately, said, "Oh", and began to turn bright red. "Sorry about that." She said sheepishly.  
光，相当恰当地说了声，“哦”，然后开始脸红。“抱歉。”她有些尴尬地说。

Shinji suddenly realized something that he hadn't noticed before, due to the interrogation.  
真嗣突然意识到一些之前由于审问而未曾注意到的事情。

That being, despite being the scariest girl in the class next to Asuka, as well as the Class Representative, Hikari Horaki was a very cute girl. A very cute girl who was standing less than a foot away from him.  
那就是，尽管是班上仅次于明日香的最可怕的女孩，同时也是班代表，光弘希是位非常可爱的女孩。一位站在离他不到一英尺远的非常可爱的女孩。

And suddenly, his right hand was shaking uncontrollably, and only every ounce of willpower in the Third Child's body was holding his hand back from what would be an utterly disastrous situation.  
突然间，他的右手不受控制地剧烈颤抖，只有第三适格者体内每一分意志力在阻止他的手陷入一场彻底的灾难。

And with Hikari looking very shy and uncertain all of a sudden, his self control was beginning to break very quickly.  
而光子突然显得非常害羞和不确定，他的自制力开始迅速崩溃。

Luckily for Shinji, the bell rang.  
幸运的是，对于真嗣来说，铃声响了。

"Alrightseeyouinclassbye!" Shinji said quickly, hurriedly rushing inside the classroom, holding his right hand at the wrist tightly.  
“好的，课上见，拜拜！” 真嗣快速说道，匆忙冲进教室，右手紧握手腕。

If he hadn't been in such a rush, he might have noticed a certain redhead who had been standing next to the door for the entire conversation...  
如果他没有那么匆忙，他或许会注意到一个红发女孩，她一直在门旁听着整个对话……

---

A few days after the narrowly avoided incident with Hikari, Shinji felt his self control wearing down further, and this was probably going to be the moment where it snapped and left him at the cruel mercy of the Second Child.  
在与光 narrowly 避免的意外发生几天后，真嗣感到自己的自制力越来越薄弱，这可能就是那个时刻，它将崩溃，让他完全屈服于二号适格者的残酷之下。

The dreams were getting more intense, the urge to... _fondle_ was growing beyond Asuka (though still, it reacted strongest around her), to the point where being around Misato (who of course, loved to prance around in skimpy clothes while in the apartment) was the equivalent of dangling above a pit of razor sharp knives.  
梦境愈发强烈，那种想要...抚摸的冲动逐渐超越了明日香（尽管在她周围依然最为强烈），以至于在美里身边（当然，她喜欢在公寓里穿着暴露的衣服四处走动）就像悬在锋利刀刃的深渊之上。

Rei was walking in front of him, and _oh dear sweet merciful Lord, why hadn't he realized how **tight** the plugsuits were!_  
丽走在他前面，哦，亲爱的仁慈的主啊，他怎么就没意识到插入栓服有多紧！

This was torture. This was the vengeance of Heaven.  
这是折磨。这是天谴。

_Lord, I'm terribly sorry for killing those angels...  
主啊，我为杀死那些天使感到非常抱歉..._

His eyes were betraying him, watching every movement of Ayanami's rear as she walked neutrally towards the Evas, every swish and every little change in that wonderful looking appendage.  
他的眼睛背叛了他，紧盯着绫波零走向 EVA 时的每一个动作，她那中性步伐中每一次摆动和那美妙肢体上的细微变化。

Thank God Asuka was behind him, or he'd probably have already lost control...  
感谢上帝，明日香在他身后，否则他可能已经失控了...

Wait... there was something warm and soft and oh so tight and firm beneath his clutching hand...  
等等... 他的紧握之手下，有某种温暖、柔软且异常紧实的东西...

Uh oh. 哎呀。

"Ikari... why is your hand on my buttocks?"  
碇... 为什么你的手放在我的臀部上？

All Hell broke loose. 地狱彻底崩坏了。

---

Naturally, Shinji wasn't conscious for most of said Hell. In fact, he was halfway to fainting when the Second Child delivered a slap of tremendous force that sent him into a wall, with a loud accusation of "PERVERT!"  
当然，真嗣对这场地狱的大部分情况毫无意识。实际上，当他被二号机驾驶员以惊人的力量扇了一巴掌，撞到墙上时，他已经快要晕过去了，伴随着一声响亮的指控：“变态！”

Still, without the Third Child, events proceeded along accordingly.  
尽管如此，没有三号机驾驶员的介入，事件还是按照既定轨迹发展了。

Misato, who had unfortunately been taking a deep swig of her piping hot coffee (no milk and sugar, to rid herself of a hangover) spat it out all over an unfortunate Ritsuko's foot, who had been slack jawed.  
不幸正在大口喝着滚烫咖啡（无奶无糖，为了醒酒）的律子，一口喷在了倒霉的律子脚上，后者正目瞪口呆。

The Head of Project E promptly screeched loudly and swore repeatedly, hopping about in an undignified manner.  
E 计划负责人立刻尖叫起来，不停地咒骂，跳来跳去，毫无风度可言。

Kaji gave a loud bark of amused laughter, and a shake of his head. "Well, I'll be. I never knew he had it in him." For that, he received a particularly forceful elbow to the ribs from Misato.  
加持发出了一阵响亮的欢快笑声，摇了摇头。“好吧，我真是没想到。我从不知道他还有这一手。”为此，他遭到了美里特别用力的一记手肘撞击。

Sub Commander Fuyutsuki simply blinked once, and only all his years and the wish to keep his dignity kept him from falling over.  
副指挥官冬月只是眨了一次眼，多年的历练和保持尊严的愿望才让他没有当场倒下。

Commander Ikari, on the other hand, actually stared blankly, so much so that his glasses fell off of his face. His spineless son actually having the nerve to cop a feel?  
另一方面，碇司令实际上是目瞪口呆，以至于他的眼镜从脸上滑落。他那懦弱的儿子居然有胆量揩油？

He couldn't deny there was the tiniest part of him that was pleased that his son was becoming a man. Of course, that part was soon squashed into pieces when he realized it was _Rei_ who had been felt up.  
他不能否认自己内心有一丝微小的喜悦，因为他的儿子正在成为一个男人。当然，这一丝喜悦很快就被碾碎了，当他意识到被揩油的是绫波时。

Fuyutsuki looked over at the shocked father, and smiled. "Congratulations. Your son is a pervert." He said sardonically, clapping his hand against his the Commander's shoulder.  
冬月瞥了一眼震惊的父亲，微笑道：“恭喜。你儿子是个变态。”他讽刺地说着，拍了拍指挥官的肩膀。

---

The first thing that crossed his mind was _This must be how Misato feels after one of her drinking binges._  
他首先想到的是：这一定就是美里喝醉后的感觉。

The second thing was that he dearly, dearly hoped he had been dreaming, and he was just now waking up from a long, maybe fever induced dream.  
第二件事是他非常、非常希望自己只是在做一个梦，现在刚刚从一场漫长的、也许是发烧引起的梦中醒来。

So Shinji prayed and hoped for a sign of reassurance.  
于是，真嗣祈祷并期待着一个安慰的迹象。

Instead, he got Misato. 结果，他等来了美里。

"Wow Shinji, you know you're supposed to have at least one date before you feel a girl up, you know." Misato said dryly, placing a wet towel on his forehead.  
“哇，真嗣，你知道的，在摸女孩子之前至少要先约会一次吧。”美里干巴巴地说道，将一条湿毛巾放在他的额头上。

"What... what happened?" Shinji asked, his throat dry, as he opened his eyes, finding himself back inside the apartment, in his room.  
"发...发生了什么？" 真嗣问道，喉咙干涩，睁开眼睛发现自己回到了公寓，在自己的房间里。

"Asuka knocked you for a loop, didn't she? Well, its just a bump, nothing serious." Misato said casually, shaking her head as she looked down on the Third Child. "Really Shinji, did you have to grope Rei right before a test?"  
"明日香把你打晕了，是吧？没事，就一个小包，不严重。" 美里随意地说道，摇着头看向第三适格者。"说真的，真嗣，你非得在测试前摸绫波吗？"

"I couldn't help it!" Shinji said, before he could stop himself. "Plugsuits... tight..." he muttered, trailing off with a fierce burn in his cheeks.  
"我控制不住自己！" 真嗣脱口而出。"插入栓服...太紧了..." 他低声嘟囔，脸颊烧得通红。

"Yeah well, you might not want to make a habit of this. Next time, Asuka might just kill you." Misato chuckled, shaking her head as she removed the towel, wringing it out.  
"是啊，不过你最好别养成这种习惯。下次，明日香可能会真的杀了你。" 美里轻笑一声，摇着头把毛巾取下，拧干。

"It's not my fault." Shinji muttered sullenly. "I've been having these weird dreams lately... where I'm this other person, and he's the one who keeps groping people."  
"这不是我的错。" 真嗣闷闷不乐地嘟囔着。"最近我一直在做这些奇怪的梦...梦里我变成了另一个人，而他才是那个不断骚扰别人的人。"

"Right..." Misato drawled, shaking her head. "Listen Shinji, you can't blame your hormones on other people, especially not people in a dream."  
"好吧..." 美里拖长声音，摇了摇头。"听着，真嗣，你不能把荷尔蒙的问题怪到别人头上，尤其是梦里的人。"

"It's not me! It's the man in my dream!" Shinji insisted.  
"不是我！是我梦里的那个人！" 真嗣坚持道。

"Then why is _your_ hand on my ass?" Misato asked playfully, winking at him, motioning towards his hand on her rear.  
"那你为什么把手放在我屁股上？" 美里俏皮地问道，朝他眨了眨眼，示意他放在她臀部的手。

Shinji stared for a moment, and screamed.  
真嗣愣了一会儿，然后尖叫起来。

---

"And he _groped her ass!_" Asuka said vehemently, moving the mob in her hands with violent strokes and a tight, merciless choke hold.  
“然后他摸了她的屁股！”明日香激烈地说道，手中的拖把在她手中猛烈挥动，紧紧地勒住，毫不留情。

"Ikari did?" Hikari blinked, gaping as she actually stopped what she was doing. "He... copped a feel on _Ayanami?"_  
“碇真嗣摸了？”光眨了眨眼，惊讶得连手上的动作都停了下来。“他……摸了绫波？”

Asuka responded with a violent nod and a deep rooted scowl, kicking the wall irritably. "That... that... that _jerk!_ How dare he!" her hands were tightly gripping the wooden handle of the mop, and Hikari was beginning to fear that the school would have to buy another.  
明日香用力点头，眉头紧锁，烦躁地踢了踢墙壁。“那个……那个……那个混蛋！他怎么敢！”她的双手紧紧握住拖把的木柄，光开始担心学校可能又要买一把新的了。

"Well... maybe it was an accident, Asuka." Hikari said soothingly, trying to make sense of the situation. The meek, stuttering Shinji Ikari, a secret pervert? "Maybe his hand slipped, or he needed to balance himself and accidentally-"  
"嗯...也许那是个意外，明日香。" 光安抚地说道，试图理清状况。那个胆小、结巴的碇真嗣，竟然是个隐藏的变态？"可能是他的手滑了，或者他需要平衡自己，不小心就..."

"Accidentally?" Asuka said derisively, snarling and narrowing her eyes with undisguised fury. "He couldn't take his eyes off her ass!"  
"不小心？" 明日香嘲讽地说，咆哮着眯起眼睛，毫不掩饰她的愤怒。"他的眼睛根本离不开她的屁股！"

Deciding to take a different track, Hikari switched her tone. "Well Asuka, at least he didn't do that to you... or would you rather he have groped you?" her tone was sly.  
决定换个策略，光改变了语气。"好吧，明日香，至少他没对你那样...还是说你宁愿他摸了你？" 她的语气狡黠。

"It'd be more understandable if it was me-" Asuka began, before her mind caught up and ground that sentence to a halt. "But I would never let a wimp like that touch my perfect body."  
"如果是我的话，或许还能理解——" 明日香刚开口，思绪随即跟上，硬生生截断了这句话。"但我绝不会让那种弱鸡碰我完美的身体。"

Just play along, Hikari reminded herself, smiling condescendingly at the redhead.  
就顺着演下去吧，光子提醒自己，对红发女孩露出居高临下的微笑。

---

Since he was excused from school after a humiliating amount of begging and pleading with Misato, but didn't feel like simply watching T.V. all day, Shinji decided to do what most people did when they weren't feeling alright.  
由于他在向美里苦苦哀求后获准不上学，但又不想整天只是看电视，真嗣决定做大多数人心情不佳时会做的事。

He took a walk. 他去散步了。

Deciding to avoid anyplace where he might see someone he knew, he walked away from his usual spots, to a different part of Tokyo-3 than he was used to. He walked, and he walked, wandering about, not really seeing anything at all.  
为了避免遇到熟人，他决定远离常去的地方，走到一个他不熟悉的东京-3 的区域。他走着，走着，四处游荡，其实什么也没看进去。

That was, until he accidentally bumped into someone.  
直到他不小心撞上了某个人。

With an embarrassed look on his face, Shinji scratched the back of his neck. "Sorry about that mister..." he said, looking up to meet a pair of brilliant emerald eyes.  
脸上带着尴尬的神情，真嗣挠了挠后颈。“抱歉，先生……”他说着，抬头迎上一双璀璨的翡翠色眼睛。

The man was young, probably younger than Misato, and his hair was a light, coppery brown that was held up by a long ponytail that rivaled Kaji's. He was wearing a casual t-shirt and jeans, and the insignia on the shirt drew Shinji's eyes- that of a fox demon, a kitsune.  
这个男人很年轻，可能比美里还小，他的头发是浅铜棕色，被一条长长的马尾辫束起，与加持不相上下。他穿着休闲的 T 恤和牛仔裤，T 恤上的徽章吸引了真嗣的目光——那是一只狐狸妖怪，即狐妖。

"No problem..." the auburn haired man said, smiling gently, but suddenly paused, and stared at him piercingly. "Miroku?"  
“没事……”红褐色头发的男人微笑着说，但突然停顿，目光锐利地盯着他。“弥勒？”

Shinji felt something familiar about this person, but shook his head. "Sorry, my name's Shinji. Shinji Ikari."  
真嗣觉得这个人有些熟悉，但还是摇了摇头。“抱歉，我叫真嗣，碇真嗣。”

"Oh. My apologies, you look a lot like someone... I knew." The man said, smiling still. "You have the same eyes."  
“哦，抱歉，你长得很像我认识的一个人。”男人依旧微笑着说，“你的眼睛很像他。”

"Uh... thanks." Shinji said awkwardly, unsure of what he was doing. As they spoke, a young woman walked by, looking sharp in a crisp business suit. Before he could stop himself, distracted as he was by the man, his hand was halfway toward her rear-  
“呃……谢谢。”真嗣尴尬地说，不知道自己在做什么。他们交谈时，一位年轻女子穿着笔挺的商务套装走过。还没等他反应过来，他的手已经不由自主地伸向了她的臀部——

The man chuckled, holding onto Shinji's wrist. "I see you also have the same wandering hand." The man's mirth was obvious as he chuckled.  
那男人轻笑一声，紧握住真嗣的手腕。“看来你的手也不安分啊。”男人的笑意显而易见，又是一阵轻笑。

"Oh... I... it's not my fault!" Shinji blurted out, flushed red. "I... I keep having these dreams, and the man in my dreams does those things."  
“哦...我...这不是我的错！”真嗣急忙辩解，脸涨得通红。“我...我总是做这些梦，梦里的男人会做那些事。”

"Really?" there was a note of interest in the man's voice, and beneath that smile was a piercing look. "Do tell."  
“真的吗？”男人的声音中带着一丝兴趣，那笑容之下是锐利的目光。“说来听听。”

Unsure why he felt so comfortable around this stranger, Shinji began to speak. He spoke about the kind, out of place schoolgirl, the strong, brash dog boy, the little fox boy, the cat, the girl named Sango, the demons, and the hole in his right hand, the Kazaana.  
尽管不明白为何在这位陌生人身边感到如此自在，但真嗣开始倾诉。他谈到了那位善良却格格不入的校园女孩，那位强壮而鲁莽的犬族少年，小狐狸男孩，猫妖，名叫珊瑚的女孩，以及那些妖怪，还有他右手掌心的洞，风穴。

As he spoke, he did not notice that the man's face was growing more and more reminiscent.  
他讲述时，并未察觉到那男子脸上愈发流露出的回忆之色。

"Well, I'll be. Miroku, your curse is stronger than I thought..." the man muttered under his breath, but Shinji managed to just catch it.  
“哎呀，真是没想到。弥勒，你的诅咒比我想象的还要严重……”男子低声自语，但真嗣还是勉强听到了。

"What?" the Third Child asked curiously. "What did you say?"  
"什么？" 第三适格者好奇地问，"你说什么了？"

"Oh, nothing." The man said casually, still smiling. "Don't mind your wandering hand, Shinji Ikari. It's simply... a _relic_ of days gone by. But I do have one question. Is there a girl whom your urge to grope is strongest around?"  
"哦，没什么。" 那人随意地说，依旧微笑着，"别在意你那游走的手，碇真嗣。这只是……过去时光的遗迹。不过我确实有一个问题。有没有一个女孩，让你最想摸她的冲动最强烈？"

Shinji was blushing heavily by now, and felt like he wanted to sink into the ground and disappear. "Ye-yes..." he stuttered.  
真嗣此时脸红得厉害，感觉自己想钻进地缝消失。"是-是的……" 他结巴着回答。

The man smiled warmly. "Then that girl must be your special comrade. Shinji, trust the man in your dreams. He may be a bit of a con artist and a pervert, but he's got a good heart. I can see you inherited that from him as well."  
男人温暖地笑了。“那么那个女孩一定是你的特别伙伴。真嗣，相信你梦中的那个人。他可能有点骗子和小色鬼，但他有一颗善良的心。我能看出你也继承了这一点。”

Without a word, he turned away. "Don't wait to speak to that special girl about your feelings. If your dreams teach you nothing else, let them teach you that."  
他一言不发地转身离开。“不要等到和那个特别的女孩谈你的感情。如果梦境没有教你别的，就让它们教你这一点。”

Shinji, dumbstruck, almost let the man walk out of sight before yelling, "Wait! What's your name!"  
真嗣目瞪口呆，几乎让那人走出视线才大喊：“等等！你叫什么名字！”

The man didn't stop walking, but responded, "My name is Shippo." In a voice too low to be heard, he whispered, "Goodbye, my old friend Miroku."  
那人并未停下脚步，只是回应道：“我叫七宝。”他低声细语，几乎听不见，“再见了，我的老朋友弥勒。”

---

Shinji arrived back at the apartment sometime later, feeling more at peace with himself than he had in a while. Accepting these urges seemed natural, a second nature he never knew he had.  
过了一会儿，真嗣回到了公寓，感觉自己比以往任何时候都要平静。接受这些冲动似乎很自然，是他未曾知晓的第二天性。

Misato had managed to break away from work earlier tonight, it appeared, as she was bent over, digging inside the fridge.  
看来美里今晚早些时候设法从工作中脱身了，她正弯着腰，在冰箱里翻找着什么。

His right hand twitched. Inwardly sighing, Shinji let his hand do what it wanted, rather than fighting it.  
他的右手微微抽动。内心叹息一声，真嗣任由手去做它想做的事，而非与之抗争。

It felt a lot better than he thought it would.  
这感觉比他预想的要好得多。

And hearing Misato suddenly shriek was absolutely priceless. "Kaji! Damn it!" the Major snarled, whirling about with her mouth ready to snap a verbal reaming... and snapped it shut.  
而听到美里突然尖叫，绝对是价值连城的瞬间。“加持！该死！”美里少校咆哮着，猛地转身，嘴巴已经准备好狠狠训斥一番……却又突然闭上了嘴。

Shinji gave her a mischievous grin and a wink, casually strutting off toward his room.  
真嗣向她露出了一个调皮的笑容并眨了眨眼，然后随意地走向自己的房间。

Misato stared for a while, and then gave a bark of laughter and downed her beer in one gulp. "Who knew... all that kid needed was a little confidence, and he's just as bad as Kaji."  
美里盯着他看了一会儿，然后爆发出一阵大笑，一口气喝干了啤酒。“谁知道呢……那孩子只需要一点自信，就和加持一样糟糕了。”

---

Shinji arrived at school the next morning, once more without his redheaded roommate, who had mysteriously disappeared once again. Frankly, he was a little disappointed. After all, Asuka was always saying he had no guts, and to grope her would take all the courage Shinji had in him.  
第二天早上，真嗣再次独自一人来到学校，他的红发室友又一次神秘失踪了。老实说，他有点失望。毕竟，明日香总是说他没有胆量，而要摸她，真嗣得拿出所有的勇气来。

Almost immediately, he was beset by his best friends, who swarmed in like sharks smelling blood. "Shinji, you the man!" Touji cheered, clapping the Third Child's back loudly.  
"几乎立刻，他就被最好的朋友们包围了，他们像嗅到血腥味的鲨鱼一样蜂拥而至。“真嗣，你真行！”冬二欢呼着，用力拍打着第三适格者的后背。”

_Funny, they never say this when I kill a giant monster bent on killing us all..._ Shinji thought to himself, feeling unexpected confidence, drawing upon the dreams for this newfound strength.  
"奇怪，我杀死一心要毁灭我们的巨型怪兽时，他们从不说这个... 真嗣暗自思忖，感受到意外的自信，从梦境中汲取了这份新生的力量。”

"Is it true? Did you really feel Ayanami up?" Kensuke questioned eagerly, staring at him with complete and utter admiration.  
"“真的吗？你真的摸了绫波？”剑介急切地问道，眼中满是崇拜之情。”

With only the tiniest hint of embarrassment, Shinji nodded his head once. The burning in his cheeks was strong, but not as bad as he thought it would be.  
带着一丝微妙的尴尬，真嗣轻轻点了点头。他的脸颊烧得通红，但并没有他预想的那么糟糕。

His friends cheered him, until an angry voice cut in through their praise.  
他的朋友们为他欢呼，直到一个愤怒的声音打断了他们的赞扬。

"Shinji Ikari!" “碇真嗣！”

Shinji's first thought was to cower away and try to use his friends as shields- or, upon failing that, simply wither and spill his guts.  
真嗣的第一反应是退缩，试图用他的朋友们作为挡箭牌——或者，如果这招失败，就干脆萎缩并吐露实情。

But he remembered the calm, collected attitude of the man in those dreams, and for some reason, calmed down. "Yes, Class Rep?" he asked smoothly, causing Touji and Kensuke to jerk and stare at him like he was mad.  
但他想起了梦中那个男人冷静沉着的态度，不知为何，他平静了下来。“是的，班长？”他平静地问道，这让东治和健介猛地转头盯着他，好像他疯了一样。

Hikari was forced to give pause by the unexpected response, but pressed on. "Just what is wrong with you! Groping Ayanami... do you understand how badly you hurt Asuka!"  
光被迫因这意外的回应而停顿了一下，但还是继续追问。“你到底怎么了！对绫波动手动脚……你知道你给明日香带来了多大的伤害吗！”

"Yeah right, like the Devil has any feelings..." Touji muttered, and received a not so subtle kick in the shins for his insolence.  
“是啊，就像恶魔会有感情一样...” 冬二低声嘀咕，随即因为他的无礼而遭到了一次不那么隐晦的踢小腿。

"You, be quiet." Hikari shushed with a dangerous tone. "You too." She added, glaring at Kensuke, cowing the spectacled boy into submission.  
“你，闭嘴。” 光用一种危险的语气嘘声道。“还有你。”她补充道，瞪着剑介，让戴眼镜的男孩屈服了。

"Asuka is still upset then, I take it?" Shinji said slowly, enjoying this feeling of calm serenity. If he hadn't spent so much time fighting the dreams, he might have been better off.  
“看来明日香还在生气，对吧？” 真嗣缓缓说道，享受着这份平静的宁静。如果不是他花了那么多时间与梦境抗争，他可能会过得更好。

"Yes, she is. And you had better apologize to her and Rei." Hikari said firmly, glaring at him with all the force she could muster. Somehow, he was reminded of the schoolgirl in his dreams.  
“是的，她是。你最好向她和丽道歉。”光坚定地说道，用尽全力瞪着他。不知为何，这让他想起了梦中的那个女学生。

Shinji barely reacted, nodding his head and giving her a slow, serene smile. "Of course." Inside, his calm was beginning to deteriorate at the mere thought of speaking to either Rei or Asuka.  
真嗣几乎没有反应，只是缓缓地点头，给了她一个平静而安详的微笑。“当然。”一想到要和丽或明日香说话，他内心的平静就开始动摇。

And then, leaving a shocked Kensuke, Touji, and Hikari, the Third Child strode confidently, not slouching, into the classroom.  
然后，留下震惊的 Kensuke、Touji 和 Hikari，第三适格者自信地、不弯腰地走进了教室。

Immediately, he spotted Rei in her usual desk, and Asuka in her own. From the heated glare the redhead threw his direction, Shinji decided to take the road less likely to cause injury.  
他立刻就看到了坐在自己位置上的丽，还有坐在她自己的位置上的明日香。从红发少女投来的炽热目光中，真嗣决定选择一条不太可能引起伤害的路。

_Calm. Be like the man in the dream. Be like him..._ Shinji chanted silently in his head. "Excuse me, Ayanami?" the blue haired girl looked up at him from her usual gazing out of the window.  
冷静。要像梦中的那个人一样。像他那样...真嗣在心里默默念叨。“打扰一下，绫波？”蓝发女孩从她惯常的望向窗外中抬起头来看着他。

"Yes, Ikari?" the First Child asked quietly, not a trace of embarrassment on her face or inflection in her tone.  
“什么事，碇？”第一适格者平静地问道，脸上没有一丝尴尬的表情，语气也没有任何变化。

_Does nothing rattle her?_ Shinji wondered, even as he spoke. "I'd like to apologize... for yesterday. That was wrong of me."  
难道没有什么能让她动摇吗？真嗣边想边说，“我想为昨天的事道歉……我那样做是不对的。”

Rei's tone didn't change, but she looked pointedly away and Shinji could have sworn he saw the lightest amount of blood go to the First Child's cheeks.  
绫波的语气没有变化，但她明显地移开了视线，真嗣几乎可以肯定，他看到一丝血色涌上了第一适格者的脸颊。

"Your apology is unnecessary. You do not have to speak of it again. It was... embarrassing." Rei seemed to have a hard time using that word.  
“你的道歉没有必要。不必再提此事。那件事……令人尴尬。”绫波似乎很难说出这个词。

"Still, I'm sorry." Shinji apologized, bowing his head.  
"不过，我还是道歉。" 真嗣低头道歉。

"Make me sick." Asuka's low growl was audible, and Shinji felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up at attention. Without a word, the redhead gave him a single venomous glare.  
"真让人恶心。" 明日香低沉的咆哮声清晰可闻，真嗣感到后颈的汗毛都竖了起来。红发少女一言不发，只给了他一个充满毒意的瞪视。

"Asuka-" Shinji cursed inwardly as the bell rang.  
"明日香——" 铃声响起，真嗣在心里暗骂。

---

By the time lunch rolled around, Shinji was feeling antsy and nervous, wanting to try and appease the furious Second Child soon, and return everything (mostly everything, anyway) to the status quo.  
到了午餐时间，真嗣感到焦躁不安，急于尽快安抚愤怒的第二适格者，并尽可能恢复（至少大部分）原有的平静状态。

Yet Asuka seemed intent on avoiding him, and, before he could so much as stand up, was already halfway to the door.  
然而，明日香似乎有意避开他，还没等他站起身，就已经快走到门口了。

"Asuka! Wait!" Shinji shouted, by the redhead simply ran faster.  
“明日香！等等！”真嗣喊道，但红发女孩只是跑得更快了。

Cursing, the Third Child pumped his legs harder, racing forward, trying to keep up with her as best he could. She turned the corner and he followed a few seconds later, and they ran, ran and ran until they were at the rooftop and Asuka had finally sunken against the fence, giving him a heated glare.  
咒骂着，第三适格者更加用力地蹬腿，奋力向前，尽可能地跟上她。她转过拐角，他几秒钟后也跟了上去，他们跑啊跑，直到到达屋顶，明日香终于靠在栅栏上，向他投来炽热的瞪视。

"Touch me... and I'll kill you." She hissed, panting hard, sweat rolling down her face.  
“别碰我……否则我杀了你。”她嘶声说道，喘息剧烈，汗水顺着脸颊滑落。

Shinji sighed, but respected her wishes, not wanting to aggravate the Second Child any more than he had to. "Asuka... look, I'm not sure what I've done to make you so angry, but I'm so-"  
真嗣叹了口气，但尊重她的意愿，不想再激怒第二适格者。“明日香……听着，我不确定我做了什么让你这么生气，但我真的——”

"Save your apologies for someone who cares." Asuka growled venomously, ripping out her bento with excessive force.  
"把你的道歉留给在乎的人吧。" 明日香恶狠狠地咆哮着，用力扯出她的便当。

"Look... I..." Shinji sighed, feeling his words useless. "I've been going through some... changes. I've been having these weird dreams, and they started messing me up in the head."  
"听着...我..." 真嗣叹了口气，觉得自己的话毫无用处。"我经历了一些...变化。我一直在做这些奇怪的梦，它们开始让我脑子混乱。

"And I suppose these _dreams_ made you grope the First?" Asuka asked sarcastically, her voice thick with contemptuous disbelief.  
"所以你梦到这些就对初号机动手动脚了？" 明日香嘲讽地问，声音中充满了轻蔑的怀疑。

"Well... yeah." Shinji said, shrugging, trying to regain some of the serenity that his dreams lent him. "I don't expect you to understand... I don't. But... it's just a change I'm going through."  
"嗯... 是的。" 真嗣耸了耸肩，试图找回梦境赋予他的那份宁静。"我不指望你能理解... 我自己也不理解。但... 这只是我正在经历的一种变化。"

"Groping girls?" Asuka questioned sardonically, but the edge was just the tiniest bit softer, less harsh as she spoke. "That's a bit more than a change, I'd say."  
"对女孩动手动脚？" 明日香讽刺地问道，但语气中的尖锐稍稍柔和了一些，不那么刺耳了。"这可不仅仅是变化，我觉得。"

"It's not like I can help it!" Shinji snapped, his patience waning and the serenity of his dream self unreachable. "You think I want to do that? To Ayanami? To Misato? To yo-" he snapped his jaw shut.  
"我又控制不了！" 真嗣厉声说道，耐心渐失，梦境中的宁静已遥不可及。"你以为我想那样做吗？对绫波？对美里？对你——" 他猛地闭上了嘴。"

"To me?" Asuka said, arching an eyebrow as she stared at him critically. "What, one girl not enough for you?"  
"给我？" 明日香挑起眉毛，目光锐利地盯着他。"怎么，一个女孩还不够你满足吗？"

Shinji paused, uncertain, his confidence and his feelings wavering for a moment.  
真嗣停顿了一下，不确定自己的信心和感情在这一刻动摇了。

"_Don't wait..."_ Shippo's voice returned to him. _That's right... don't wait._  
"别等了..." 小狐狸的声音再次在他耳边响起。没错...别等了。

"I just lost control, with Ayanami... it's been hard, you know. Between Misato walking around like she always does, and you..." Shinji trailed off, but Asuka was relentless, seeking _something_.  
"我只是失控了，和绫波在一起...你知道的，这很难。在美里像往常一样走来走去，还有你..." 真嗣话没说完，但明日香不依不饶，追寻着什么。

"And me what? What, Shinji? Do you think I'm some kind of tramp?" Asuka's voice was hard and merciless, pressing forth her advantage with all speed.  
"还有我什么？什么，真嗣？你以为我是那种随便的人吗？" 明日香的声音冷酷无情，迅速施压以巩固她的优势。

"It was you first, alright!" Shinji blurted out, looking away and standing up hurriedly, kicking the ground irritably. "When those dreams started, my hand couldn't stop trying to... to..."  
"是你先开始的，好吧！" 真嗣脱口而出，目光移开，急忙站起身，烦躁地踢着地面。"那些梦开始时，我的手就停不下来想要...想要..."

Asuka growled, her eyes narrowing in annoyance. "So what, you decided that you didn't feel like copping a feel on me? I wasn't good enough for you?" her voice, despite all its angry bluster, had a note of disappointed hurt.  
明日香咆哮着，眼中闪过一丝恼怒。“所以呢，你决定不想对我动手动脚了？我对你来说不够好吗？”尽管她的声音充满了愤怒，却透露出一丝受伤的失望。

"That's not- not what I said..." Shinji muttered, feeling quite lost now, desperately grasping for the aid of his dreams. But somehow, he knew this was something that had to be done on his own.  
“那不是——我不是那个意思……”真嗣喃喃自语，此刻感到十分迷茫，迫切地想要抓住梦境中的帮助。但不知为何，他知道这件事必须靠自己解决。

"Then what? What do you mean?" Asuka stamped her foot impatiently, her nostrils flaring as she snarled irritably. "What the Hell has been bothering you!"  
“那是什么？你到底什么意思？”明日香不耐烦地跺着脚，鼻孔张开，恼怒地咆哮。“你到底在烦恼什么！”

"Iwantedtogropeyouthemost" Shinji blurted out rapidly, and immediately regretted this decision. His feet left the ground and despite his exhaustion from chasing Asuka up here, he began to run-  
"我最想抱住你" 真嗣急忙脱口而出，随即就后悔了这个决定。他的脚离开了地面，尽管追着明日香上楼已经筋疲力尽，他还是开始奔跑——

Only to be grabbed by the collar and pulled backwards, until he sprawled on the ground, groaning slightly in pain.  
结果被抓住了衣领向后拽去，直到他四肢着地，痛苦地微微呻吟。

"What did you do that for, Asuka..." Shinji muttered, feeling a slight ringing, a testament to hitting the ground with his head.  
"你为什么要这么做，明日香..." 真嗣喃喃自语，感觉头部着地后有些轻微的耳鸣。

Instead of responding, the Second Child straddled him, pinning him down with her strong legs, placing her hands on his shoulders to prevent his arms from being used. "What the Hell does that mean?" Asuka demanded dangerously, seemingly unaware of their compromising position.  
"第二适格者没有回答，而是跨坐在他身上，用她有力的双腿将他牢牢固定住，双手按在他的肩膀上，防止他使用双臂。“这他妈是什么意思？”明日香危险地逼问道，似乎没有意识到他们这尴尬的姿势。”

"I don't know!" Shinji said loudly, struggling against his captor.  
"“我不知道！”真嗣大声说道，挣扎着想要摆脱束缚。”

"The Hell you don't!" Asuka snarled, releasing his arms to grab his shirt and pull him close to her, her light blue eyes meeting his darker, metallic blue ones.  
"“你他妈的不知道！”明日香咆哮着，松开他的手臂去抓他的衬衫，将他拉近自己，她浅蓝色的眼睛与他对视，他的眼睛是更深的金属蓝色。”

"It means..." Shinji thought back. The man in the dreams... he would grope most the girl he loved the most. He couldn't stop wanting to touch her, couldn't help himself...  
"这意味着..." 真嗣回想着。梦中的那个男人... 他会抚摸他最爱的女孩。他无法停止想要触碰她，情不自禁...

"It means I really like you."  
"这意味着我真的很喜欢你。"

There it was. 就是这样。

Those words were out there now, and suddenly Shinji felt like a floodgate had opened. "It means I envy you for your strength and your confidence, your beauty, that everyone likes you, and you're just so much better than me-"  
那些话已经说出口了，突然间，真嗣感觉像是打开了泄洪闸。“这意味着我羡慕你的力量和自信，你的美丽，大家都喜欢你，你比我优秀得多——”

Asuka couldn't help herself. She had been complimented before, of course- by adults, by peers, by children. Some of it had been professional, some of it simply sick college boys trying to pick up a teenage genius, some of it jealousy. But this... this was sincere, and it touched Asuka in a way that hundreds of cheesy love letters never had.  
明日香情不自禁。她当然曾被赞美过——来自成年人，来自同龄人，来自孩子们。有些是出于职业需要，有些只是病态的大学生试图追求一位天才少女，有些则是出于嫉妒。但这次……这次是真心的，它以数百封俗气的情书从未有过的方式触动了明日香。

She kissed him, very lightly, bring him up to her with one swift movement.  
她轻轻地吻了他，迅速地将他拉近自己。

It was different from the last time, they both reflected. Now it was impulsive, not a word spoken between them to prepare, and this time, they both felt like breathing wasn't important.  
与上次不同，他们俩都意识到了这一点。这次是冲动的，没有任何言语在他们之间准备，而这一次，他们都感觉呼吸似乎变得不那么重要了。

Finally, Asuka released him, panting slightly with slightly swollen lips. She tried to speak, and shut her mouth.  
终于，明日香放开了他，微微喘息着，嘴唇略显肿胀。她试图说话，却又闭上了嘴。

Shinji smiled, and, despite herself, Asuka smiled back.  
真嗣笑了，尽管如此，明日香也回以微笑。

They stayed there for a few moments, content to simply be there and smile, like that was all that mattered.  
他们在那里停留了片刻，满足于仅仅在那里微笑，仿佛这就是最重要的事情。

Until, of course, Shinji's hand decided now was an opportune time to finally get what it wanted, and proceeded to give Asuka quite a shock.  
直到当然，真嗣的手决定现在是时候最终得到它想要的，并继续给明日香带来了相当大的震惊。

Shinji smiled weakly now, and his chuckle sounded a bit strained.  
真嗣现在虚弱地笑了笑，他的笑声听起来有些勉强。

Asuka's eyebrow twitched, and she raised her shaking fist. "Shinji..." she said slowly, irritably.  
明日香眉头一跳，颤抖的拳头高高举起。“真嗣……”她不耐烦地缓缓说道。

"DIE!" “去死！”

Shinji groaned as he rubbed his head, nursing yet another Asuka-induced bump on the noggin. Well, at least he got to kiss her...  
真嗣揉着脑袋呻吟，又添了一处明日香造成的肿包。好吧，至少他吻到了她……

Asuka stalked off, muttering to herself about perverts and being taken advantage of. However, when she reached the doorway, she couldn't help herself, and giggled slightly, smiling softly.  
明日香气冲冲地走开，嘴里嘀咕着变态和被人占便宜。然而，当她走到门口时，还是忍不住轻轻笑出声，脸上露出了温柔的微笑。

And though he couldn't possibly see it, Shinji smiled back.  
尽管他不可能看到，真嗣也回以微笑。

Despite herself, Asuka couldn't help but feel that something between them had changed for the better.  
尽管她不愿承认，但明日香忍不住觉得他们之间的关系似乎变得更好了。

"Idiot." "白痴。"

Author's Notes 作者笔记

And so ends the most absurdly lengthy one shot I've ever written. Man, this took so long to complete, but it was worth it. How did it start? Well, I suppose I got bored, and noticed some similarities between Shinji and Miroku. Just the eyes and a bit of the hair, really.  
至此，我写过的最冗长的一篇短篇小说也落下了帷幕。天哪，完成它花了这么长时间，但一切都是值得的。它是如何开始的呢？嗯，我想是因为我感到无聊，然后注意到了真治和弥勒之间的一些相似之处。其实也就是眼睛和一些发型的相似罢了。

Then, of course, I followed the plot bunny all the way here.  
然后，当然，我一路跟着剧情兔来到了这里。

This hasn't been pre-read, beta-ed, etc. All in all, I figure I could have given Rei some more scenes, as well as Misato. But, this is a Shinji-centric story, and so it shall stay. The words Shinji mutters while he's asleep are a reference to the episode where Miroku proposes to Sango... episode 132 or so, I think. The opening dream is Episode 28.  
这篇文没有经过预读、校对等步骤。总的来说，我觉得可以给丽和美里多安排一些场景。但这是一部以真嗣为中心的故事，所以它将保持这样。真嗣在睡梦中喃喃自语的内容，是参考了弥勒向珊瑚求婚的那一集...大概是第 132 集吧。开篇的梦境则是第 28 集。

---
### Comment
[gunman](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/544647/gunman): 
Miroku's legacy is intact, and ironically it falls on the most inhibited person in existence.  
弥勒的传承依旧完好，讽刺的是，它落在了这个世界上最拘谨的人身上。  
  
The whole 'I become this... guy, and I fight these demons along with a bunch of other people...” Shinji said slowly, shaking his head in confusion. “And afterward, or sometimes before, I keep... groping this one girl, who keeps slapping me.”  
‘我变成了这个……家伙，然后和一群人一起对抗这些恶魔……’ 真嗣缓缓地说道，困惑地摇着头。‘之后，或者有时之前，我总是……摸这个女孩，她不停地扇我耳光。’  
  
That whole thing kinda reminded me of Shinji, who fights the Angels who look like monsters/demons, and he has groped Rei, though that was totally accidental, and she did slap him, right?  
那整件事让我想起了真嗣，他对抗那些看起来像怪物/恶魔的天使，他曾无意中摸到了绫波，然后她确实扇了他一巴掌，对吧？  
  
Shinji groping Rei AND Misato? DAMN! YOU GO SHINJI!  
真嗣居然在摸索丽和美里？靠！真嗣你真行！  
  
Okay, right when you started describing the man with the ponytail and emerald eyes, I got suspicious, but when you mentioned the insignia of the fox demon, I realized it was Shippo. Being a demon I guess it makes sense that he could be alive after all this time. And it's just a coincidence that he happens to run into the one person who has inherited Miroku's curse.  
好吧，当你开始描述那个扎马尾辫、有着翡翠色眼睛的男人时，我就开始怀疑了，但当你提到狐妖的徽章时，我就知道那是七宝。作为一个妖怪，考虑到他能活这么久也说得通。而且他恰好遇到那个继承了弥勒诅咒的人，这真是巧合。  
  
Misato doesn't seem too affected by this whole thing. Although calling Shinji as bad as Kaji is a little harsh, considering how much she pretty much resents the man at times. And it does make you wonder just how much Kaji actually does grope Misato when he's at NERV.  
美里似乎对这件事并不太在意。虽然把真嗣和加持相提并论有点过分，毕竟她有时对加持相当反感。这也让人好奇加持在 NERV 时到底对美里做了多少次不规矩的事。  
  
And you're right, Shinji never really got comments from anyone when he saved their lives from giant monsters. But grope a couple of girls and suddenly you're a super stud.  
你说得没错，真嗣从巨型怪兽手中救了大家无数次，却从未得到过任何人的感谢。但只要摸了几个女孩，突然间就成了超级情圣。  
  
And of course, Shinji would have apologized to Rei for that whole incident, had he been conscious to do so when Asuka hit him.  
当然，如果真嗣当时清醒的话，他肯定会为那次事件向绫波道歉，可惜他被明日香打晕了。  
  
The final scene between Shinji and Asuka was pretty good. Asuka is upset with Shinji at him groping girls, and not her, but at the same time denies that it's actually true and she wants his touch.  
真嗣和明日香最后的场景相当精彩。明日香对真嗣摸了其他女孩而非自己感到不满，却又否认自己真的想要他的触碰。  
  
Guess that's Asuka for you, a mass of contradictions.  
这就是明日香，一个充满矛盾的集合体。  
  
Still, it was nice to see Shinji confess his feelings, and actually becoming more at ease with his 'curse'. Alot less stress when you don't fight, right?  
尽管如此，看到真嗣坦露心声，并逐渐适应他的‘诅咒’，还是让人感到欣慰。不战斗的时候，压力也少了很多，对吧？  
  
And he likes Asuka, and she does like him, though his wandering hand is going to be a problem at times, but it's still going to be funny to see.  
而且他喜欢明日香，她也确实喜欢他，虽然他那不安分的手有时会是个问题，但看到这一幕还是会觉得有趣。  
  
Anyway, even though I'm not a big Shinji/Asuka fan, the few stories I have read are pretty good. Like this one.  
无论如何，虽然我不是新世纪福音战士中的真嗣和明日香这对 CP 的狂热粉丝，但我读过的几篇故事都相当不错。比如这篇。  
  
That does beg the question, is there going to be a second chapter or have you intended this to be a oneshot?  
这确实引出了一个问题，是否会有第二部《1001 夜》，还是你打算让它成为一篇短篇小说？  
  
Just an idea.  
只是个想法。  
  
Write On! 写作启航！

[Lovemichi](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8781289/Lovemichi): I really enjoyed this fic.  Poor Shinji, now with this curse, he will take more hits from Asuka.  At the end Asuka and Shinji get together.  
我真的很喜欢这篇同人文。可怜的 Shinji，现在有了这个诅咒，他会从 Asuka 那里受到更多打击。最终 Asuka 和 Shinji 走到了一起。

[justbehappydammit](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1527113/justbehappydammit): Damn, I don't even know these other characters, but I can imagine them clear as day. That is a testament to the skill of your writing. Also this is perhaps your funniest story ever.  
该死，我甚至不认识这些其他角色，但我能清晰地想象出他们。这证明了你写作技巧的高超。而且这可能是你迄今为止最有趣的故事。

[fhngdfrydkuti](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1206358/fhngdfrydkuti): Funny... Shippo was grown, and demons age so much more slowly than humans... It was very funny, but a quick little note I made was that Shinji got his "curse" from his mom's side, as Gendo would have realized it... A bit too much overanalyzing the Inuyasha parts, but what can I say, that would be like not trying to analyze the religious symbols in evangelion. But on to the rubrics: It was ooc, points off there, but if was a crossover, points off there as well, however, i restored the points of the ooc-ness. minor grammar and spelling, funny, a little character development, but nothing too big, a sensible plot for a non-one shot, and an AS... as far as I can tell, this all adds together to warrant you a 6/10. Kudos. And to everyone else who is reading this review, I suggest you stop now, already kinda wasting 55 seconds off your life... 56, 57, 58, 59, awesome, 1 whole minute of your life now belongs to me... lol  
有趣的是...七宝已经长大了，而妖怪的衰老速度比人类慢得多...这很有趣，但我快速记下的一点是，真嗣的“诅咒”来自他母亲的家族，因为碇源堂本应意识到这一点...对《犬夜叉》部分的分析有点过度，但我能说什么呢，这就像不去分析《新世纪福音战士》中的宗教符号一样。但回到评分标准：角色行为有些出戏，扣分了，但如果是跨界作品，同样会扣分，不过，我恢复了因角色行为出戏而扣的分数。轻微的语法和拼写错误，有趣，有一些角色发展，但不算太大，对于非短篇故事来说，情节合理，还有一个 AS...就我所见，这些综合起来足以给你一个 6/10 的评分。赞。而对于正在阅读这篇评论的其他人，我建议你们现在就停下来，已经浪费了你们 55 秒的生命...56 秒，57 秒，58 秒，59 秒，太棒了，现在你们的一分钟生命属于我了...哈哈

[Linkin-Phoenix](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/578289/Linkin-Phoenix): 
This was great, I rarely laugh that hard so thanks, I needed a good laugh.  
这真是太棒了，我很少笑得这么开心，谢谢，我正需要这样一场大笑。  
  
Once again a great Eva story, I've never seen Inuyasha but I had little trouble understanding the parts that were dropped in. Although maybe if you'd stretched this out over a couple of chapters it would have been better.  
又一次精彩的 Eva 故事，虽然我从未看过《犬夜叉》，但理解那些穿插的部分并不困难。不过，也许如果你能将这个故事扩展到几个章节，效果会更好。  
  
I can see what you mean by not having it beta read. The one thing I really noticed, was when Asuka was mopping the floor, it came out as mob instead of mop.  
我明白你说的没有经过校对的意思了。我注意到的一个明显错误是，当明日香在拖地时，‘拖把’被误写成了‘暴徒’。  
  
Still this was great, extremely funny, and well written. I was wondering how you'd merge the two one being in Fedual Japan, however this really worked, congratulations.  
尽管如此，这篇作品非常出色，极其幽默，且文笔流畅。我原本好奇你如何将两个背景——一个是封建时期的日本——融合在一起，但结果证明这种结合非常成功，恭喜你。  
  
Later, 再会，

[TsukinoSora](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/970489/TsukinoSora): Oh wow! This is so good! Hehe, at first, when I saw that it was an Evangelion/InuYasha fic, my brain went: "Bwah? Me not understand..." but I read it anyway, and I'm so glad I did! You have such an excellent grasp of character and it's so original to combine these two animes. It's VERy funny, but still sweet at the same time and entertaining. I love ShinjixAsuka and MirokuxSango, and it's very cool to see them together in a fic, (even if only in a dream)! Anyway, this is SO amazing! Thanks for the awesome read! :D  
哦哇！这太棒了！呵呵，一开始，当我看到这是《新世纪福音战士》/《犬夜叉》的同人文时，我的脑子是：“啥？我搞不懂...”但我还是读了，我很庆幸我这么做了！你对角色的把握非常出色，将这两部动漫结合在一起的想法非常新颖。既非常有趣，同时又很甜蜜且引人入胜。我喜欢真嗣和明日香，还有弥勒和珊瑚的组合，看到他们在同人文中（即使只是在梦中）在一起真是太酷了！总之，这真是太神奇了！感谢你带来的精彩阅读！:D
