Someone won't leave Asuka alone. Rei responds. shoujoai!  
新篇章！有人不让明日香安宁。绫波回应。少女爱！

This is another couple I've been dying to write! They're an odd couple, but look so cute together (insert random cute shoujo-ai pic). I'm talking about Asuka and Rei. I read an article about a psychologist who watched the show and diagnosed our pilots. He said Rei needed to get out more and Asuka needed to put more effort into caring about others. Thus, I'm contributing to this shoujo-ai pairing and attempting to deal with the diagnoses.  
这是我渴望撰写的另一对组合！她们虽是奇特的一对，但在一起时看起来如此可爱（插入随机的可爱百合图片）。我指的是明日香和丽。我读过一篇关于一位心理学家观看该剧并诊断我们驾驶员的文章。他说丽需要多出去走走，而明日香则需在关心他人方面多下功夫。因此，我致力于这一百合配对，并尝试应对这些诊断。

Disclaimer: I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion. If I did… First, Shinji wouldn't even act like he had a crush on his mother's DNA. Second, I wouldn't have gone psycho with a great story. Lastly, Asuka and Rei would've been going out by the end.  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》。如果我拥有的话…首先，真嗣不会表现得像对他母亲的 DNA 有迷恋。其次，我不会用一个精彩的故事变得疯狂。最后，明日香和绫波会在结尾时在一起。

Warning: I'm absolutely certain there will be some out of character moments here, but it's hard sometimes… And don't forget. This is shoujo-ai, which means two girls will be in love. (Yea!)  
警告：我绝对确定这里会有一些角色行为不符合原作的时刻，但有时候这很难避免…别忘了。这是少女爱题材，意味着会有两个女孩相爱。（耶！）

Rant over. Story begin, now!  
牢骚发完。故事现在开始！

Speaking "…" 说着“…”  
Thoughts '…' 思绪‘…’

My Protector 我的守护者

---

It was a normal, successful day for Asuka Langley Soryu. She had managed to maintain her dominance of the class, well mostly. There was still Wonder Girl. Although, there was some progress was made. Occasionally, Rei would look over at her during one of her rants. It still didn't seem like she was listening. She was just looking and Asuka almost felt like she was beingadmired.  
对于惣流·明日香·兰格雷来说，这是一个普通而又成功的一天。她成功地保持了自己在班级的优势地位，嗯，基本上是。还有那个奇迹少女。不过，还是有些进展的。偶尔，绫波会在她发飙时看向她。尽管看起来她并没有在听，只是看着，明日香几乎感觉自己被欣赏了。

'Nah. She's weird, but…' Asuka reasoned.  
'不，她很奇怪，但是……' 明日香这样想着。

Her thoughts were interrupted by the voice of the girl in question. "Excuse me, but you're blocking the door." Asuka looked over and noticed the blue-haired girl trying to get past Hiro, the biggest jerk in class. He was the only idiot to try to force her into a date, which failed miserably.  
她的思绪被那个女孩的声音打断。"对不起，但你挡住门了。"明日香转头看到蓝发女孩正试图从班级里最大的混蛋——广那里通过。他是唯一一个试图强迫她约会却惨败的白痴。

"I'll let you out, if you go out with me." He said, with a self-assured smirk.  
"如果你跟我出去，我就放你走。" 他带着自信的微笑说道。

'Not that trick again!' Asuka roar mentally. 'I can see why he'd try to ask her out, she'spretty cute... Mein Gott in Himmel! What am I thinking?' Asuka shook her head. She quickly dodged around Rei and pushed Hiro out of the way.  
'别再用那招了！' 明日香在心里咆哮。'我明白他为什么想约她出去，她确实很可爱...我的天哪！我在想什么？' 明日香摇了摇头。她迅速绕过绫波，推开了弘。

"Like she'd go out with you! C'mon, let's go, Wonder Girl." Asuka grabbed her silent ally's hand and pulled her outside. Her mind was a storm. 'Do I really think she's pretty?' She took a quick look at the girl beside her who happened to be looking directly at her. She turned around quickly. 'Yes, I definitely do.' She blushed and continued walking.  
"她才不会跟你出去呢！快点，我们走，奇迹少女。" 明日香抓住她沉默的同伴的手，把她拉到外面。她的思绪如风暴般翻涌。'我真的觉得她很漂亮吗？' 她迅速瞥了一眼身旁的女孩，对方恰好也在直视她。她迅速转过头。'是的，我确实这么认为。' 她脸红了，继续前行。

"Pilot Soryu…" Rei began.  
"碇司令…" 绫波开始说道。

"Yes, Wonder Girl?" Asuka tensed. 'There's no telling what she'll say…'  
"什么事，奇迹少女？" 明日香紧张起来。'真不知道她会说什么…'

"Why are you walking with me to my apartment?"  
"你为什么要陪我走到我的公寓？"

Asuka thought for a second. "To make sure Hiro doesn't follow you home." 'Good one.' She congratulated herself.  
明日香想了一会儿。“为了确保广不跟着你回家。”‘说得好。’她暗自祝贺自己。

"Will you be meeting me in the morning, then?" Rei asked with more interest than Asuka knew she had.  
“那么，你早上会来见我吗？”绫波问，语气中的兴趣比明日香所知的还要浓厚。

"Uh, I'm not sure…" She kicked herself. 'Way to go, dumkompf.'  
“呃，我不确定……”她暗骂自己。‘真是笨蛋。’

"Oh." Rei looked… disappointed?  
"哦。" 丽看起来……失望了？

Asuka sighed. "What time should I meet you there?" Rei didn't smile, but there was a small glimmer to her eye.  
明日香叹了口气。"我应该几点到那里见你？" 丽没有笑，但她的眼中闪过一丝微光。

"Eight." Rei paused as if uncertain. "By the way, Pilot Soryu, how long were you planning to hold my hand?"  
"八点。" 丽停顿了一下，似乎有些犹豫。"顺便问一下，惣流驾驶员，你打算握着我的手多久？"

Asuka let out a yelp as if burned. 'How long have I been holding her hand? How many people have seen us together?' She tried to come up with something to yell in her defense, but came up empty. Hermind was full ofimages of them walking hand-in-hand down the street, looking every bit the romantic couple. 

"Sorry, Wonder Girl, I didn't realize I was doing it." She slumped in defeat. However, Rei wasn't done with surprising her yet. 

"I didn't mind." Asuka's brain nearly blew a circuit. They were silent the rest of the way to Rei's apartment. They said their goodbyes, which were warmer than usual and the next thingAsuka knew she was walking back to Misato's apartment in a daze. 

'Since when did Wonder Girl have this kind of effect on me?' Then, the ID card incident flashed in her mind.  
“从什么时候起，奇迹少女对我有这么大的影响？”随即，身份证事件在她脑海中闪现。

She had just been trying to deliverRei's new Nerv ID card. She walked into the quiet, seemingly empty apartment. Then, somehow, she fell on top of a wet, naked Rei. It wasn't the first time she'd seen the other pilot undressed (she had been taking cautious peeks in the Nerv dressing rooms), but it was certainly the first physical contact between the two. It had taken her a moment to make herself get up. That moment had haunted her dreams for weeks.  
她只是想送 Rei 的新 Nerv 身份证。她走进那间安静、看似空无一人的公寓。然后，不知怎么的，她跌倒在湿漉漉、赤裸的 Rei 身上。这已经不是她第一次看到另一位驾驶员没穿衣服了（她曾在 Nerv 更衣室里小心翼翼地偷瞄过），但绝对是两人第一次有身体接触。她花了片刻才让自己站起来。那一刻，已经困扰了她好几个星期的梦境。

She blushed. 'What am I going to do abouther tomorrow?"  
她脸红了。“明天我该怎么面对她呢？”

Her inner voice screamed: "Protect her from that jerk until you figure out these feelings!" She nodded to herself and entered her apartment. Shinji gave her a confused look at Asuka's lateness, but said nothing. He'd rather face a huge pile of homework than draw attention to himself.  
她内心的声音尖叫着：“在她弄清楚这些感觉之前，保护她远离那个混蛋！”她对自己点点头，走进了公寓。真嗣对明日香迟到感到困惑，但什么也没说。他宁愿面对一大堆作业，也不愿引起别人的注意。

--

The next morning Asuka snuck out early to walk Rei to school. She knocked on the door and nearly had a heart attack when the door opened immediately. Rei was dressed and ready to go. If her hair wasn't wet and the uniform freshly ironed, Asuka would've thought she slept in it.  
第二天早上，明日香早早溜出去陪绫波去学校。她敲了敲门，门立刻打开时差点吓得心脏病发作。绫波已经穿好衣服准备出发了。如果不是她的头发还湿着，制服也是刚熨好的，明日香会以为她穿着睡衣睡了一夜。

She broke out of her spell. "Ready to go?" Rei nodded and they left. As they walked down the street, Asuka felt the urge to take Rei's hand. She managed to restrain it. To distract herself, she decided to explain an idea she had come up with while trying to go to sleep.  
她从恍惚中回过神来。“准备好了吗？”绫波点点头，她们便出发了。走在街上时，明日香有种想牵绫波手的冲动。她勉强克制住了。为了转移注意力，她决定解释一下自己睡前想到的一个主意。

"Rei, I think I've got an idea to keep Hiro from bothering you. You should tell him you're going out with someone."  
“丽，我想到了一个办法让广不再烦你。你可以告诉他你在和某人约会。”

"Who should I be going out with? Pilot Ikari?" Rei tilted her head cutely.  
“我应该和谁约会呢？碇真嗣吗？”丽歪着头，显得很可爱。

Asuka nearly bowled over. "No! He's a pervert and would take it wrong."  
“明日香差点笑翻了。“不！他是个变态，会理解错的。”

"Then who?" “那么是谁？”

"I don't know. I don't trust any of these immature boys."  
“我不知道。我不信任这些不成熟的男孩。”

"What about the girls?" “那女孩们呢？”

Asuka's heart pounded. 'I should've seen this coming.' "It's wrong, Rei…" Even though she said it, she felt it was a lie.  
明日香的心怦怦直跳。'我早该料到这一点的。' “这样不对，丽……”尽管她这么说，却觉得这像是在撒谎。

"Why? I saw two girls kissing and holding hands. They looked happy." Asuka'simmediately conjured images of her and Rei kissing. She blushed profusely.  
“为什么？我看到两个女孩在接吻和牵手。她们看起来很开心。”明日香立刻想象起自己和丽接吻的画面。她的脸颊顿时红透了。

"I don't know. Just make up someone." She tried not to notice the hurt that most wouldn't have noticed in those ruby eyes.  
“我不知道。随便编个理由吧。”她努力不去注意那双红宝石般的眼睛中，大多数人不会察觉到的受伤神情。

--

As expected, Hiro blocked Rei on her way to lunch, even going as far as to grab her arm. Asuka bristled from her hiding spot.  
不出所料，Hiro 在 Rei 去吃午饭的路上拦住了她，甚至抓住了她的手臂。Asuka 从她的藏身之处皱起了眉头。

"So when are we going out, babe?" he said, with some attempt at intimidation. Rei wasn't affected, but he wasn't enough of a threat for the girl to take action.  
"那我们什么时候出去约会，宝贝？"他试图用威胁的语气说，但 Rei 并未受到影响，他也不足以构成威胁让女孩采取行动。

"I'm all ready going out with someone." Rei said with her usual monotone.  
"我已经和别人有约了。"Rei 用她一贯的单调语气说道。

"Yeah? I bet I'm more of a man than he is! Drop the loser and go out with a real man!"  
“是吗？我敢说我比他更有男人味！甩了那失败者，和真正的男人出去吧！”

"I'm sorry I'm all ready going out with someone." Rei repeated.  
“对不起，我已经和别人有约了。”丽重复道。

Hiro wasn't giving up. "I think you're lying. Otherwise, you wouldn't be alone right now." He put a hand on Rei's shoulder.  
宏并没有放弃。“我觉得你在撒谎。不然的话，你现在不会一个人。”他把手放在丽的肩膀上。

That was it for Asuka. She was in between them in an instant, shoving Hiro backwards. "Leave Wonder Girl alone! She's with me!"  
就这样，明日香瞬间插到他们中间，将广推开。“别欺负神奇女孩！她跟我在一起！”

The boy wasn't buying it. "Her going out with you? Yeah, right! You pick on her all the time."  
那男孩不相信。“她跟你出去？得了吧！你总是欺负她。”

"It was an act to hide my true feelings." It felt likea confession. She looked back at Rei when she felt their hands meet and clasp. The blue-haired girl was almost smiling! Asuka felt her face heat up.  
“那只是为了掩饰我的真实感情。”这话听起来像是一种告白。她回头看向丽，感觉到他们的手相遇并紧握。蓝发女孩几乎在微笑！明日香感到自己的脸热了起来。

"How about some real proof? Kiss." His face was evil. He was sure this was the ultimate revenge. Either way she would look like a fool. Backing down from a challenge or kissing her 'rival.'  
“来点真正的证明如何？亲一个。”他的脸上带着邪恶的笑容。他确信这是终极的复仇。无论哪种情况，她都会显得像个傻瓜。要么在挑战面前退缩，要么亲吻她的‘对手’。

Asuka pulled back to lay him out but was turned around and felt a soft pair of lips descend upon hers. They were clumsy, but gentle. Asuka forgot herself and wrapped her arms around the blue-haired girl.  
明日香本想退后给他一击，却被转过身来，感觉到一对柔软的唇瓣轻轻落在她的唇上。虽然笨拙，却很温柔。明日香忘我地抱住了蓝发的女孩。

Rei returned the embrace, much to the surprise of Hiro. 'I thought they hated each other.' The class began to filter back in from lunch.  
丽也回抱了她，这让广感到惊讶。‘我以为她们互相讨厌。’班级里的同学们开始从午餐时间陆续回到教室。

The teacher was shocked at Asuka's behavior. "Asuka, stop that! You're not an animal!" Asuka tried to comply, but a pale hand pulled her back into the kiss. "Hey, I'm talking to you, too! Rei?"  
老师对明日香的行为感到震惊。“明日香，住手！你又不是动物！”明日香试图听从，但一只苍白的手将她拉回吻中。“嘿，我也在跟你说话呢！丽？”

Shinji fell over completely in his chair. "Maybe Hell's frozen over…" Unbeknownst to him, he would be helping the other twopilots move Rei's things into Asuka's room that evening.  
真嗣完全从椅子上摔了下来。“也许地狱已经结冰了……”他并不知道，当晚他将帮助另外两位驾驶员把丽的物品搬进明日香的房间。

End 结束

Too short? Too silly? I'm just happy to do my part to get Rei and Asuka together! Yes, the ending may have felt a little like 'Poetry In Motion,' but the rest of it was different. As with all my stories, I hope to inspire others to write (or draw) their own work. Don't forget, if you want to use an idea of mine, feel free. Just don't forget to tag my name in the credits!  
太短了？太傻了？我只是很高兴能尽我的一份力让丽和明日香走到一起！是的，结局可能感觉有点像‘动感诗篇’，但其余部分是不同的。和我的所有故事一样，我希望能够激励其他人去写作（或绘画）他们自己的作品。别忘了，如果你想使用我的一个想法，尽管拿去用。只要别忘了在致谢中提到我的名字！

Please, review. I always like to hear from you!  
请留下评论。我总是喜欢听到你们的反馈！

---
Well, there were several requests for more Asuka/Rei goodness on my part, so who am I to argue? Inspiration hits occasionally and this one was relatively easy to follow through with.  
好吧，我这边收到了不少关于更多明日香/丽精彩内容的要求，我怎能拒绝呢？灵感偶尔会降临，这次的故事相对容易展开。

It's like the previous story, except that the "protector" is different. It's a different story under the same idea. Call it a remix, if you will. I hope you like!  
这就像前一个故事，只不过“守护者”不同。这是同一个想法下的不同故事。如果你愿意，可以称之为混音版。希望你会喜欢！

Disclaimer: I don't own Neon Genesis Evangelion! My head couldn't take the extra brain fart! Although the ad for the Angelic Days manga has potential. (Rei and Asuka holding hands and blushing! Yay!)  
免责声明：我不拥有《新世纪福音战士》！我的脑袋可承受不了额外的脑洞！尽管《天使之日的漫画》广告有潜力。（丽和明日香手牵手脸红！耶！）

"I said go away, Kosuke!" A redheaded girl yelled. "You're not good enough for Asuka Langley Sohryu!"  
"我说了走开，高助！" 一个红发女孩喊道。"你配不上惣流·明日香·兰格雷！"

"But we were meant to be together!" The young man pleaded.  
"但我们注定要在一起！" 年轻人恳求道。

"Sorry." Asuka said with dismissal. "Goodbye!"  
"对不起。" 明日香带着不屑说道。"再见！"

Kosuke started pursuit, but was cut off by a door slamming into his face. Out of the room came a blue-haired girl who was quite familiar to Asuka.  
小助开始追赶，却被一扇门猛地撞在脸上。一个蓝发女孩从房间里走出来，明日香对她颇为熟悉。

"Hi, Wonder Girl," she began with a semi-polite greeting. The other girl had just removed an irritating boy from her sight, so some civility was in order.  
"嗨，奇迹少女，" 她半礼貌地打招呼。对方刚摆脱了一个烦人的男孩，所以保持一些礼貌是必要的。

"Hello, pilot Sohryu," was the usual monotone reply.  
“你好，飞行员惣流，”是那惯常的单调回应。

"Thanks… for the help." Asuka said, trying to show some gratitude. She quickly turned and left for home.  
“谢谢……你的帮助。”明日香说道，试图表达一些感激之情。她迅速转身，朝家的方向走去。

It wasn't long before she noticed a second pair of footsteps behind her own. 'If Kosuke's following me home, I'll have Misato shoot him!' She looked behind and saw Rei. 'Why is she following me?'  
没过多久，她就注意到自己身后传来了另一双脚步声。‘如果高雄在跟踪我回家，我就让美里射他！’她回头一看，是绫波。‘她为什么跟着我？’

"Is something wrong?" Asuka asked mildly concerned.  
“有什么不对劲吗？”明日香略带关切地问道。

"Nothing, pilot Sohryu." was the reply.  
“没什么，惣流驾驶员。”对方回答道。

Nothing of note happened on the way home, but Rei faithfully followed her home like a puppy. Asuka felt a surprising feeling of safety having those bright red eyes watching out for her.  
回家的路上并没有发生什么值得一提的事，但丽像小狗一样忠实地跟在她身后。明日香感到一种意外的安全感，有那双明亮的红眼睛在守护着她。

The German girl couldn't come up with an appropriate farewell before Rei took off. She waited long enough to make sure Asuka was inside.  
德国女孩在丽离开前没能想出合适的告别词。她等了足够久，确保明日香已经进屋。

'Is she trying to protect me from Kosuke?' She pondered during her bath. 'It's sweet but I can handle him myself!' She sighed.  
'她是在试图保护我免受高助的伤害吗？'她在洗澡时思索着。'虽然很贴心，但我自己能应付他！'她叹了口气。

That night she dreamt of a blue-haired knight who broke the evil doll who had been chasing her. She smiled in her sleep.  
那一晚，她梦见了一位蓝发骑士，击碎了追逐她的邪恶玩偶。她在睡梦中露出了微笑。

--

The next morning, Asuka and Shinji had a surprise waiting at the door.  
第二天早上，明日香和真嗣在门口遇到了一个惊喜。

Shinji managed to sputter out something first. "Why are you here, Rei?"  
真嗣先是一愣，然后结结巴巴地问道：“你为什么在这里，绫波？”

Rei shyly looked from him to the German girl. "I'm here to walk pilot Sohryu to school."  
绫波害羞地从他看向德国女孩。“我是来陪驾驶员惣流上学。”

Asuka blushed and pulled the blunette out the door towards school.  
明日香脸一红，拉着蓝黑色头发的女孩出了门，朝学校走去。

Shinji just stood there floored. "That's weird."  
真嗣只是站在那里，目瞪口呆。“真奇怪。”

Misato sipped her morning beer. "No, that's cute." She grinned into the can.  
美里啜饮着早上的啤酒。“不，那很可爱。”她对着罐子咧嘴一笑。

--

When they reached school, Asuka couldn't stand it any longer. "Why did you follow me home yesterday and walk me to school today?"  
"当他们到达学校时，明日香再也忍不住了。“你昨天为什么跟着我回家，今天又陪我走到学校？””

Rei took a moment to respond. "Because Kosuke has been showing signs of an obsession with you and is a danger to you."  
"绫波丽顿了一下才回答。“因为高介对你表现出痴迷的迹象，对你构成危险。””

"Is this just because I'm an Eva pilot?" Asuka had a suspicion, one that made her slightly nervous.  
“这仅仅是因为我是 EVA 驾驶员吗？”明日香心中有个猜疑，这让她略感不安。

"No…" Rei said with a blush.  
"不…" 丽脸颊微红地说道。

"Then why?" Asuka felt the need to push for the full truth.  
"那又是为什么？" 明日香觉得有必要追问到底。

"I want to keep you safe…" Rei said, her eyes dropping to the floor.  
"我想保护你…" 丽说着，目光垂向地面。

Asuka was shocked by the intense flutter she felt. "You like me… even after how I've treated you?"  
明日香被那强烈的悸动震惊了。“你喜欢我……即便我那样对待你？”

Rei looked directly into the German's blue eyes. "You make me feel alive. I'm not just another pilot to you. There's no one else who makes me feel so… significant."  
绫波直视着德国少女的蓝眼睛。“你让我感到自己活着。对你来说，我不只是另一个驾驶员。没有其他人能让我感到如此……重要。”

Asuka smiled. She was special to someone. She realized that this was a unique opportunity to change both of their lives. "Does this mean you want to go out with me?"  
明日香微笑了。她对某人来说是特别的。她意识到这是一个改变两人生活的独特机会。“这是否意味着你想和我约会？”

Confused, Rei tilted her head cutely. "What do you mean 'go out'?"  
困惑中，丽可爱地歪了歪头。“你说的‘出去’是什么意思？”

Asuka blushed. "Do you want to be my girlfriend?" She wasn't sure how to explain further.  
明日香脸红了。“你想做我的女朋友吗？”她不确定如何进一步解释。

A look of understanding dawned on the pale face and she nodded. "I would like that, pilot Sohryu." There was the beginning of a small smile.  
苍白的脸上露出了理解的表情，她点了点头。“我很愿意，飞行员惣流。”一丝微笑开始浮现。

Asuka returned a friendly smile and lightly grasped Rei's hand. "First thing, Wonder Girl… I mean Rei… call me Asuka."  
明日香回以友好的微笑，轻轻握住绫波的手。“首先，奇迹少女…我是说绫波…叫我明日香吧。”

"Asuka…" The other girl seemed to be attempting to taste it. Asuka was surprised at how much she liked hearing her say it.  
“明日香…”另一个女孩似乎在尝试品味这个名字。明日香惊讶于自己有多喜欢听她说出这个名字。

The classroom warning tone sounded and they hurried off to class.  
教室的预备铃响起，她们匆匆赶往教室。

--

"Asuka… and Rei!" Shinji said with some confusion.  
“明日香…还有绫波！” 真嗣带着几分困惑说道。

"Hell must have frozen over…" Touji said with a grin that spoke that he was happy about the new relationship.  
“地狱肯定都冻住了…” 冬二咧嘴笑道，显然对这段新关系感到高兴。

Kosuke was truly upset. "You were supposed to go out with me! Why?"  
高须克弥真的很难过。“你本该和我出去的！为什么？”

Asuka, still on cloud nine, replied: "Did I forget to mention that I'm a lesbian?"  
明日香还沉浸在九霄云外的喜悦中，回答道：“我是不是忘了提，我是个女同性恋？”

"You… dyke!" The outraged young man made an attempt to grab Asuka. Suddenly, in a blur of motion he was on the floor with Rei standing over him.  
“你……这个女同！”愤怒的年轻人试图抓住明日香。突然间，他眼前一花，发现自己已经躺在地上，零站在他面前。

"If you come near my girlfriend again, I will be forced to use more force to dissuade your actions." Surprisingly, the monotone made it all the more threatening.  
“如果你再靠近我的女朋友，我将不得不使用更多的力量来阻止你的行为。”出乎意料的是，那平淡的语调反而让这番话更具威胁性。

The end result involved Kosuke transferring to another part of the country. Not to mention, Rei was rewarded for her efforts with a kiss on the cheek. The surrounding boys all received nose bleeds. Asuka was too happy to slap them and call them perverts, since she had gotten Rei to blush again; something so cute to defy words.  
最终结果是，小助转到了国内的另一个地方。更不用说，玲因为她的努力得到了一个脸颊上的吻。周围的男生们都流了鼻血。明日香太高兴了，没去打他们或骂他们是变态，因为她让玲再次脸红了；那种可爱简直无法用言语形容。

End 结束

I hope ya'll liked this.It worked out relatively quick. If you're lucky, I might have another one ready soon.  
希望你们喜欢这个故事。它完成得相对较快。如果幸运的话，我可能很快就会准备好另一个。

Please, read and review. It'll make someone's day. (mine!)  
请阅读并留下评论。这会让某人的一天变得美好。（就是我！）

### Comment
[Teresa Kaiju](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/898515/Teresa-Kaiju): Short, yes. But long enough to be very enjoyable. Using Hiro to push Asuka into "protecting" Rei was a good idea and seemed very reasonable. Incidently I haven't actually seen Evangelion due to reports of it's being depressing. I really don't need that. But I kind of know Asuka and Rei from the fanfic's I have read and I think they fit together very well.
简短，是的。但足够长，非常愉快。用 Hiro 推动明日香“保护”Rei 是个好主意，而且看起来很合理。顺便一说，EVA 很压抑，我实际上还没有看过新世纪福音战士。我真的不需要那个。但我从我读过的同人小说中认识明日香和丽，我认为她们非常适合在一起。

[Tukuyomi](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/521698/Tukuyomi):
While I have to admit that Asuka/Rei is one of those rare pairings that never really occured to me during the series, I really like reading about them, for they would be such a good match if it weren't for Asuka's pride and Rei's inability to speak to anyone normally except Gendo. I don't think it's impossible, though, and this story shows how easy it could work out.  
虽然我不得不承认明日香/玲是我在系列中从未真正想到的罕见配对之一，但我真的很喜欢阅读他们，因为如果不是明日香的骄傲和 Rei 无法正常与任何人交谈，他们会是很好的搭配除了源堂。不过，我不认为这是不可能的，这个故事表明它是多么容易。  
  
I really liked Rei's innocent questions, it's so like her and Asuka really fits the role of her "teacher" in those things.  
我真的很喜欢 Rei 的天真问题，这太像她了，明日香在这些事情上真的很适合她的“老师”角色。  
  
Really enjoyable story, though it's a little short. But I guess entertaining short stories are better than possibly boring long ones  
真的很愉快的故事，虽然有点短。但我想有趣的短篇小说比可能无聊的长篇小说要好  
  
Anyway, nice work, I do hope you'll write more about them some time.  
总之，干得不错，我希望你能在一段时间内写更多关于它们的文章。  
  
And lastly, just a minor thing, but when Asuka called herself "dumkompf" I guess you meant "Dummkopf", but that's not really important, just wanted to point it out  
最后，只是一件小事，但是当明日香称自己为“dumkompf”时，我猜你的意思是“Dummkopf”，但这并不重要，只是想指出一下  
  
Anyway, thx for this cute story!  
无论如何，感谢这个可爱的故事！

[Luchs](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/274055/Luchs):
Ah! Oh my gawd, this is love! I don't think it was that short. I think it got everything you intended out, therefore it's the perfect length, . It's so great to see new A/R fics on this site, see as they ARE such a rarity.  
啊！哦，我的傻瓜，这就是爱！我不认为它那么短。我认为它得到了你想要的一切，因此它是完美的长度，.很高兴在这个网站上看到新的应收账款，因为它们是如此罕见。  
  
Haha, the teacher walking in on them and Rei pulling her back down was great. "You're not an animal!" *giggle*  
哈哈，老师走进来，丽把她拉下来，真是太好了。“你不是动物！”  
  
What psychologist are you talking about? Was it on the internet that you read this, and if so, could you please, please, please send it to me!  
你说的是哪位心理学家？你是在互联网上读到的吗，如果是这样，你能不能，请，请，请把它发给我！  
  
Anyways, this was great. Favoriting it.  
无论如何，这很棒。收藏它。  
  
-Ciao! Luchs -再见！猞猁

Hilarious. The story was a bit short, but that's fine. Quality over quantity. Asuka's confession(if you can call it that) wasn't very well-founded, but I don't care, it was still a confession. - Wish you'd write more on this pairing, so I'm putting you on Author Alert.  
热闹。故事有点短，但没关系。质量胜于数量。明日香的忏悔（如果你可以这么称呼的话）不是很有根据，但我不在乎，这仍然是一个忏悔。- 希望你能写更多关于这个配对的文章，所以我把你放在作者警报上。

Wow, I didn't expect another chapter of this, but the role-reversal was quite nice. I could actually imagine Rei coming to such a conclusion to follow Asuka around as a protector, without saying anything. Her line: "Because Kosuke has been showing signs of an obsession with you and is a danger to you." was really the best. Oh the irony.  
哇，我没想到还会有另一个chapter，但角色反转非常好。我真的可以想象 Rei 得出这样的结论，以保护者的身份跟随明日香，什么也没说。她的台词：“因为浩介一直表现出对你的痴迷，对你是一种危险。哦，具有讽刺意味的是。  
  
Rei not understanding what "to go out" means was absolutely cute, I bet she really would be that clueless.  
Rei 不明白“出去”是什么意思真是太可爱了，我敢打赌她真的会那么无知。  
  
The threat in the end was funny, with Kosuke transferring so far away. Somehow silent types like Rei always strike me as potential "Yuumura Kirika"-types, so I was hardly surprised *g*  
最后的威胁很有趣，Kosuke 转移得很远。不知何故，像 Rei 这样的沉默类型总是让我感到潜在的“Yuumura Kirika”类型，所以我并不感到惊讶 *g*  
  
Anyway, this chapter was a nice change, and because I can't decide which of the two scenarios I like more, I'll say they were equally good _~  
无论如何，这是一个chapter不错的变化，而且因为我无法决定我更喜欢这两种情况中的哪一种，所以我会说它们同样好_~

[Teresa Kaiju](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/898515/Teresa-Kaiju): A delightful story which I was able to enjoy even though I haven't actually seen Evangelion. I have read a lot of fanfics about it though and that helps.  
一个令人愉快的故事，即使我还没有真正看过新世纪福音战士，我也能享受。不过，我读过很多关于它的同人小说，这很有帮助。

[RahXephon](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/847246/RahXephon): Your first chapter is written kind of sloppy. Some words are sticked together. The romance went way too fast, by normal standards. The characters were OOC right from the start, with no character development that logically shows why they have feelings for each other. And your second chapter is even shorter. Sorry, if this is a cheap attempt at bumping your fic on top with an effortless chapter, then it's just junk in my eyes. Other people may like your fic, but I don't.  
你的第一个chapter写得有点草率。有些词是粘在一起的。按照正常标准，这段恋情过得太快了。这些角色从一开始就是OOC，没有角色发展，从逻辑上可以看出他们为什么对彼此有感情。而你的第二个chapter甚至更短。对不起，如果这是一次廉价的尝试，可以毫不chapter费力地将你的小说撞在上面，那么在我眼中它只是垃圾。其他人可能喜欢你的小说，但我不喜欢。

[minako366](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/933451/minako366): OMG! The was teh cutest thing I have ever read. I can't believe it. You made them so cute in this. I loved how rei came to her recue at the end. And that threat...wow...had me shaking. Great job.  
我的天啊！这是我读过的最可爱的东西。我真不敢相信。你让他们变得如此可爱。我喜欢 rei 最后如何回到她的身边。而那个威胁......哇。。。让我浑身发抖。干得好。

[Lucrecia Almasy](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/186005/Lucrecia-Almasy): So sweet of Asuka to stand up for Rei! very nice story. Asuka & Rei forever! When I reviewed first time I hadn't realized there was a second chapter :P. But again! I'm saying it's so cute to see them caring for each other. By the way, I don't think they are too out of character. Bring another chapter up! :D
明日香为丽挺身而出，真是太贴心了！非常棒的故事。永远的明日香和丽！我第一次评论的时候还没意识到还有第二章呢：P。不过还是那句话 我是说看到他们互相关心真是太可爱了。顺便说一句，我觉得他们并没有太出格。再写一章吧！

[Joe Habana](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/581143/Joe-Habana): oi  cute... so... ah you are a genius TToTT... i like your fics TT_TT.. nice job TT_TT  please... do more.. much more TToTT...
可爱。。。所以。。。啊，你是个天才TToTT...我喜欢你的 fics TT_TT..干得好TT_TT  请。。。做更多..更多TToTT...

[unannehmlichkeiten](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1437540/unannehmlichkeiten): Great story, well told. I especially enjoyed the use of German for Asuka's exclamations. Whether you speak German or not, it's a nice touch. What I really enjoyed was the advances Rei made. Kind of out of character, but so good! AsukaxRei forever!  
很棒的故事，讲得很好。我特别喜欢用德语来表达明日香的感叹。不管你说不说德语，这都是一个不错的选择。我真正喜欢的是 Rei 取得的进步。有点不合时宜，但太好了！永远的 AsukaxRei！

[tuxjim](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4200828/tuxjim):
Rather 'cutsie', but still...the 'repeat but reverse the roles' set-up in Part 2 was almost redundant, but you managed to have Rei inject a bit of her "personality" into it.  
相当“可爱”，但仍然......第 2 部分中的“重复但颠倒角色”的设置几乎是多余的，但你设法让 Rei 在其中注入了一些她的“个性”。  
  
My only complaint - it quite probably could have been longer, but both parts were still well-written.  
我唯一的抱怨 - 它很可能更长，但两部分仍然写得很好。  
  
I'm putting YOU, as the author, on ;follow' so I can see what 'new' things you come up with, not just with these characters but others. I tried to leave a comment or two as a PM on your profile, but my WiFik keeps screwing up and refusing to load things completely sometimes.  
我把你，作为作者，穿上;跟着“，这样我就可以看到你想出了什么”新“的东西，不仅仅是这些角色，还有其他角色。我试图在您的个人资料上以 PM 的身份留下一两条评论，但我的 WiFik 总是搞砸并且有时拒绝完全加载内容。  
  
Ja ne for now.  
Ja ne 现在。
