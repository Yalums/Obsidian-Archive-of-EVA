## Act I
### Chapter 1 Ue o Muite **Arukō** 昂首向前走

What Gendo Ikari remembered most about his mother was her hospital room.  
碇源堂记忆中最深刻的是他母亲的病房。

The soapy vanilla scent of the sheets and how very, very cold his legs had been, dangling from the plastic chair nearest her bed. It was the kind one might find in an elementary school, cracked at the backrest and with rust spattered stands. Feet kicking side to side, he would examine the holes in his sneakers while his most prized, and really only possession – a clunky cassette player – sat in his lap.  
床单上那淡淡的香草肥皂味，以及他的双腿从离她床最近的塑料椅子上垂下时，那种非常非常冷的感觉。那椅子可能是小学里常见的，靠背处裂开了，支架上还溅着锈迹。他的脚来回踢动，一边检查着运动鞋上的洞，一边抱着他最珍爱的，也是唯一的财产——一个笨重的随身听。

He'd bought it at a festival for his seventh birthday, when his mother had handed him a five-hundred yen coin and told him to get whatever he wanted. They'd been playing songs from Kyu Sakamoto, making him think of her standing by the radio in the kitchen. How she would shake her head and smile whenever his music came on.  
他在一个节日里买了这个随身听，作为他七岁生日礼物，当时他妈妈递给他一枚五百日元的硬币，让他去买任何他想要的东西。他们播放着坂本九的歌曲，让他想起了她在厨房里站在收音机旁的样子。每当他的音乐响起时，她总会摇摇头，微笑着。

"I'm going to be famous one day, Geny, just you wait. A hot American singer like that Sakamoto fella'."  
“总有一天我会出名的，Geny，等着瞧吧。就像那个坂本九一样的美国热门歌手。”

At home on her nightstand, she used to keep pictures of Judy Garland and Rosemary Clooney, and had once owned a wall-spanning collection of swing era albums. She'd gathered them all throughout her younger years, scrounging together every bit of excess yen, but had to sell them once he was born. He used to think it'd be nice to buy them all back for her one day. She loved to sing and had even learned some English to try and echo those American jazz artists just right.  
在家中她的床头柜上，她曾摆放着朱迪·嘉兰和罗丝玛丽·克鲁尼的照片，还一度拥有一整面墙的摇摆时代专辑收藏。这些都是在她年轻时一点一滴攒钱收集的，但自从他出生后，不得不将它们全部卖掉。他曾想过有一天能把这些都买回来送给她。她喜欢唱歌，甚至为了更好地模仿那些美国爵士艺术家而学习了一些英语。

Gendo never had the chance to hear her cadence, at least not at an age he could remember, due to the illness that so often confined her to a bed. He liked to imagine she sounded like the people on his mixtapes, of which he had a handful, tossed in with the player he'd bought from the vendor. They kept him company whenever she was away or in the hospital. When he closed his eyes and started to drift off in their moldy, water stained home, he imagined it was her lulling him to sleep.  
源渡从未有机会听到她的歌声，至少在他能记住的年纪之前，因为她经常因病卧床。他喜欢想象她的声音就像他混音带里的人一样，他有一些这样的磁带，和从摊贩那里买来的播放器一起扔在一边。每当她不在或住院时，它们陪伴着他。当他闭上眼睛，在他们潮湿发霉、水渍斑斑的家中渐渐入睡时，他想象着是她在哄他入睡。

They had not been making him very sleepy at the time, and he'd been doing his best to tune out his step-father arguing with the doctors out in the hall. That was when he had felt her fingers in his hair, gently calling his attention.  
那时这些音乐并没有让他感到困倦，他正尽力不去听继父在走廊里与医生的争吵。就在那时，他感觉到她的手指在他头发里轻轻地吸引他的注意。

There wasn't any hair left on her head and she was very thin, so much so he could make out every bony contour under her skin. Her eyelids were droopy, but she managed to smile a little for him. Or it looked like she was smiling. He couldn't tell for sure because of the mask over her face.  
她的头上已无一根发丝，瘦削得惊人，以至于他能看到她皮肤下每一处骨头的轮廓。她的眼皮沉重，却尽力对他露出一丝微笑。或者说，看起来像是在微笑。因为有面罩遮住了她的脸，他无法确定。

She beckoned him with shaking arms and he crawled in bed with her, resting his head against her breast and listening to her heart. A frail hand tugged the silicone cover from her chin, dragging it down with every little ounce of strength she could muster. Holding him, she started to sing. Her tortured throat made the words scratchy and at times hard to decipher, but it was still the most beautiful thing he'd ever heard.  
她颤抖着双臂招呼他过去，他便爬上床与她依偎，将头靠在她的胸前，聆听她的心跳。一只虚弱的手拽着她下巴上的硅胶罩，用尽她仅存的力量一点点往下拉。她拥抱着他，开始唱歌。她那饱受折磨的喉咙让歌声变得沙哑，有时难以辨认，但这仍是他听过的最美妙的声音。

"_I look up while I walk... so the tears won't fall... remembering those spring days, but tonight I have you... I look up while I walk, counting the stars with teary eyes... remembering those summer days... but tonight I have you..._"  
“我走路时抬头望天...这样泪水就不会落下...回忆那些春日时光，但今晚我有你...我走路时抬头望天，泪眼婆娑地数着星星...回忆那些夏日时光...但今晚我有你...”

Each word came so slow, shivering from her lips one by one while something wet trickled into his hair. He was not sure when her voice had stopped, or when the whirring of the life support had turned into a deafening whine. She was still warm, even after her heart stopped beating, and he fought the nurses when they tried to pry him free. Up until his stepfather grabbed him and smacked him, eyes furious and cheeks overrun with tears.  
每一个字都吐得如此缓慢，颤抖着从她唇间一字一字地飘出，而某种湿润的东西正滴入他的发间。他不记得她的声音何时停止，也不记得生命维持系统的嗡嗡声何时变成了震耳欲聋的噪音。即使她的心脏停止了跳动，她依然温暖如初，他拼命抵抗着试图将他拉开的护士们。直到他的继父抓住他，狠狠地扇了他一巴掌，眼中怒火中烧，脸颊上满是泪水。

Gendo could not be certain why this vast graveyard, gritty and barren, reminded him of somewhere so sterile and frigid. At the very least he was able to bring flowers this time, while his mother and her very small marker had received none. It had taken all of their savings just to give her a proper funeral. He couldn't be sure if his mother had even cared much for flowers.  
碇源堂无法确定为何这片广阔的墓地，粗糙而荒凉，会让他想起某个如此冰冷而洁净的地方。至少这次他能够带来鲜花，而他的母亲和她那小小的墓碑却未曾得到过任何花束。为了给她一个体面的葬礼，他们几乎耗尽了所有的积蓄。他不确定母亲是否真的喜欢花。

In fact, Yui had never told him what her favorite blossoms were either. If she had ever entertained a preference. So he settled on white chrysanthemums at the suggestion of the priest, who'd seen fit to offer his advice where it was not asked for. Gendo did not have the strength to hold him under much contempt for it.  
事实上，碇唯从未告诉过他她最喜欢的花是什么。如果她有过什么偏好。所以在牧师的建议下，他选择了白色的菊花，那位牧师自作主张地提供了未经请求的建议。碇源堂没有足够的力气去对他抱有太多轻蔑。

Before him was a black slab, decently taller than his mother's tiny marker. But there was no corpse to cremate, no ashes to sift through for bones, starting from the feet and slowly wandering to the head as they were sorted into a small urn. Nor would there be a plaque for her at her family's shrine, which had been destroyed with the entirety of Tokyo. This place was merely a mass grave without corpses, a hollow testament that there was once life here.  
在他面前是一块黑色的石板，比他母亲那小小的墓碑要高得多。但没有尸体可以火化，没有骨灰可以筛拣，从脚开始慢慢向上，直到头部，将它们分类装进一个小小的骨灰盒。也不会有她的牌位放在家族的神龛上，因为整个东京都已被摧毁。这个地方只是一个没有尸体的集体坟墓，一个空洞的证明，这里曾经有过生命。

No, for Yui, there was just a name and a date. He supposed that would suffice. Gendo kneeled to set the flowers down at its base, plastic crinkling as it left his fingers. After a moment of debate, he decided against praying, resting his hands on his thighs instead. He used to pray, long ago for the handful of times he was able to visit his mother. At least there had been a jar full of ashes back then, something tangible and real to hear his thoughts and prayers.  
不，对于 Yui 来说，只有一个名字和一个日期。他认为这已经足够了。Gendo 跪下来将花放在石板底部，塑料在他松手时发出沙沙声。经过片刻的犹豫，他决定不祈祷，而是将手放在大腿上。很久以前，在他能来看望母亲的少数几次中，他曾祈祷过。至少那时还有一罐满满的骨灰，有实实在在的东西可以聆听他的心声和祈祷。

Worship had ceased at home shortly after she passed. They hadn't been able to afford some of the more grand and elaborate shrines he had seen in other homes. Rather, it was a re-purposed cupboard put on a stool by the front door. One of the panels had always hung slightly ajar from a crooked hinge, allowing one to glimpse the small, weathered bodhisattva statuette inside and mother's prayer beads hanging from its neck.  
自从她去世后，家中的供奉很快就停止了。他们负担不起他在其他家庭见过的那些宏伟精致的佛龛。相反，那只是一个被改造成佛龛的橱柜，放在前门旁的一个凳子上。其中一块面板因铰链歪斜而始终微微敞开，让人得以窥见里面那尊历经风霜的小小菩萨雕像，以及挂在它颈间的母亲的念珠。

When they came home from the funeral, he covered it in white paper like grandfather had taught him. To ward away any evil spirits. His step-father smashed it to pieces a week later during another one of his drunken fits.  
葬礼结束后回到家，他按照祖父教他的方法，用白纸将佛龛覆盖起来，以驱赶邪灵。一周后，他的继父在一次醉酒发作中将其砸得粉碎。

In his and Yui's home now, there was no shrine to Buddha or God or Ahura Mazda – or any other deity imagined by man. Their religion was one of fields and particles, collections of neural data and cells that congealed to form people and reality as they knew it.  
在他和由依的家中，既没有供奉佛陀、上帝或阿胡拉·马兹达——也没有任何人类想象中的神祇。他们的信仰是关于田野和粒子，是关于凝聚成他们所知的人和现实的神经数据和细胞集合。

For such a very long time, before the gateway to metaphysics had been opened to him, Gendo had decided that life was just an accidental collision of fields and energies. That, when those two powers ceased to hold together, there was nothing. No afterlife, no rebirth, no great journey to some ethereal plane. It was a sad kind of existence when he dwelled on it, but Yui had never seen it that way. His wife had found the light in everything.  
在通往形而上学的门扉向他敞开之前，任重而道远，源渡曾认定生命不过是场偶然的场域与能量碰撞。当这两种力量不再维系时，便一无所有。没有来世，没有重生，没有通往某个缥缈境界的伟大旅程。当他深思时，这是一种悲哀的存在，但唯从未如此看待。他的妻子在一切事物中找到了光明。

She had, ever so subtly, converted him.  
她以极其微妙的方式改变了他。

Rock and mineral scraped at his back, where Shinji stood, quiet, but looking to him in askance. So steady and thoughtful for a four year old. He'd completely forgotten the boy was even there. Gendo turned away when he realized there was more than a question in his son's eyes – there was fear. And why shouldn't he be afraid?  
岩石和矿物刮擦着他的背部，真嗣站在那里，安静，却带着询问的目光望向他。一个四岁的孩子竟如此沉稳而深思。他完全忘记了男孩的存在。当源渡意识到儿子眼中不仅有疑问，还有恐惧时，他转过身去。他为何不该害怕呢？

Yui had envisioned a future, for herself – and for him. She'd seen something in him that others had given up searching for, and offered him a place in that warm world of hers when no one else cared to offer him anything. In time, he had begun to see it too, in the way she smiled at her round belly and asked him what they would name this new life.  
优衣曾为自己——也为他——构想过一个未来。她在他的身上看到了别人放弃寻找的东西，并在无人愿意给予他任何东西时，向他敞开了她那温暖的世界。渐渐地，他也开始看到了，从她对着圆滚滚的肚子微笑并询问他他们会给这个新生命取什么名字的那一刻起。

There were hands holding firm to the fabric of his pants as they balled into fists. His hands, but not his hands. They did not feel as though they belonged to him, and he eased forward, hunched in front of her grave as his fingers moved to sink into the earth.  
有双手紧紧抓住他的裤料，攥成拳头。是他的手，又不是他的手。它们感觉并不属于他，他向前倾身，在她墓前弓着背，手指移动着陷入泥土中。

_Help me, Yui. 帮帮我，优衣。  
_  
"Please... help me." “请...帮帮我。”

---

The boy was throwing another fit. Over what, Gendo couldn't fathom. Something in the meal? He told the boy to sit and be silent.  
那男孩又在发脾气了。为了什么，源堂无法理解。是饭菜里的什么东西吗？他让男孩坐下并保持安静。

Little Shinji threw his dinner plate to the floor and screamed, "I hate you!"  
小真嗣把他的晚餐盘子扔到地上，尖叫道：“我恨你！”

Gendo's hands met the table as he stood, another threat on the tip of his tongue.  
源堂的手撑在桌面上站起身来，舌尖又是一句威胁。

"You killed her! You killed her!"  
“你杀了她！你杀了她！”

There was a resounding _slap_ and Shinji was half to the floor, cheek splotched red. Gendo's blood went cold in an instant and try as he might in the years to come, he would never forget that face. That look of utter betrayal. He would have rather faced his wife's empty entry plug again than be looked at like that.  
一声响亮的耳光，真嗣半跌在地，脸颊红肿。源堂的血液瞬间冰冷，无论未来多少年，他都无法忘记那张脸，那种彻底背叛的表情。他宁愿再次面对妻子空荡荡的插入栓，也不愿被那样注视。

Reality tumbled over the boy, drawing out tearful wails. "I want my mommy!" Shinji half sobbed and half shrieked, running to his room and slamming the door shut.  
现实如潮水般淹没了男孩，引出阵阵泪泣。“我要妈妈！”真嗣半是抽噎半是尖叫地跑回房间，砰地一声甩上了门。

Gendo's shoulders slumped and for a while he just stared down the hall, listening to the rhythmic _tick tick_ of the wall-mounted clock and the muffled chirping of the cicada bugs outside. The mid-summer heat pooled over him and he looked to the open patio doors with a frown. It was always mid-summer... and it always _would_ be. For as long as they were allowed to endure – which did not seem to be very long at all.  
源渡的肩膀垮了下来，他盯着走廊好一会儿，听着墙上挂钟有节奏的滴答声和外面蝉鸣的低沉鸣叫。仲夏的热气笼罩着他，他皱着眉头看向敞开的露台门。这里永远是仲夏……而且永远都会是。只要他们被允许忍受——似乎并不会太久。

His eyes fell to the white shards and remnants of food scattered across their maroon rug. He bent and started to collect the pieces bit by bit. The nerves in his fingers danced and flesh parted as sharp glass carved into his hand. Gendo cursed, clutching his wrist as if that would do something to ease the searing burn. Red flowed from his fingers and palm, thick globules clinging to his knuckles before falling to soak into the carpet.  
他的目光落在散布在深红色地毯上的白色碎片和食物残渣上。他弯下腰，开始一点一点地捡拾碎片。手指的神经跳动着，皮肤被锋利的玻璃割开。源渡咒骂着，紧握手腕，仿佛这样能减轻灼烧的疼痛。鲜血从他的手指和手掌流出，厚厚的血滴粘在指关节上，然后滴落，浸入地毯。

All at once the apartment seemed darker, heavier. It weighed down on him like a rolling tidal wave, swallowing every ounce of energy he had left. Eventually, Gendo found the will to stand at the sink. Water splashed into the steel basin and mingled with drops of blood, until steam began to rise and he stuck his hand under the scalding water. His skin screamed and he grit his teeth as white-hot pain dove into the pink flesh. He kept it there under the hissing water until he couldn't feel anymore.  
突然间，公寓显得更加昏暗沉重。它像滚滚而来的巨浪，吞噬了他仅存的每一丝精力。最终，源渡找到了站在水槽边的意志。水花溅入不锈钢盆中，与血滴混合，直到蒸汽开始升腾，他将手伸入滚烫的水中。皮肤在尖叫，他咬紧牙关，白热的疼痛钻入粉红的肉体。他把手放在嘶嘶作响的水下，直到再也感觉不到任何东西。

He turned the faucet off, flexing his fingers, buzzing with sensory overload. He found the medical kit in the storage closet off of the kitchen and wrapped it tight in gauze. As he went about cleaning up the dining room mess, carefully this time, he noticed the answering machine near the door winking a tiny red light.  
他关掉水龙头，活动着手指，感觉神经超载。他在厨房旁的储物柜里找到了医药箱，用纱布紧紧包扎。当他小心翼翼地清理餐厅的混乱时，注意到门边的答录机上闪烁着微弱的红色灯光。

Another call from the professor? That would be the most logical answer. The staff, the Committee – being Director of a global research group meant he had little time to himself, especially with that meddlesome old man leaning over his shoulder.  
又是教授的来电吗？这似乎是最合理的解释。员工们，委员会——作为全球研究组织的负责人，他几乎没有自己的时间，尤其是那个爱管闲事的老头总是在他身边。

Deciding to ignore the waiting messages yet again out of spite, Gendo started washing the dishes. His watch read 12:01.  
出于怨气，Gendo 再次决定无视那些等待回复的消息，开始洗碗。他的手表显示时间是 12:01。

The entire day had been spent home, quietly sorting through the "office". Discarding what was not needed, boxing other items and possessions. There were still shelves lined with books, from philosophical to scientific, to just plain fiction. The living room was modest, but well furnished – though at the moment felt bigger than a theater without an audience. In the other room, their bedroom, it was a maze of organized chaos. Everything was probably a bit dusty now. He'd been sleeping on the couch for the past few days.  
一整天都在家里安静地整理着“办公室”。丢弃不需要的东西，将其他物品和财产装箱。书架上依然排列着各种书籍，从哲学到科学，再到纯粹的小说。客厅虽不大，但家具齐全——尽管此刻感觉比没有观众的剧院还要空旷。在另一个房间，他们的卧室，则是一片井然有序的混乱。现在一切可能都蒙上了一层灰尘。过去几天他一直睡在沙发上。

Shinji had been an utter nuisance the entire time. Gendo supposed that was just the nature of children, and the reason he had so vehemently protested having one. Even with the private tutor, the boy was... difficult. It was a burden he'd never wanted – had never believed he was capable of bearing. It was at Yui's insistence that they'd had a child.  
Shinji 整个过程中完全是个麻烦。Gendo 认为这不过是孩子的天性，也是他如此强烈反对要孩子的原因。即便有私人教师，这孩子也...很难搞。这是他从未想要——也从未认为自己能承受的负担。是 Yui 的坚持让他们有了孩子。

She had believed. 她曾深信不疑。

Gendo looked around the living room again to keep his thoughts from drifting, to keep his heart from stinging. Everything reminded him of her. The scent of her citrus body wash permeated every pillow, and the heavy lavender aroma of her perfume soaked itself in the walls and washed through his lungs.  
碇源堂再次环视客厅，以阻止思绪飘散，防止心痛加剧。一切都让他想起她。她柑橘味的沐浴露香气弥漫在每个枕头上，而她浓郁的薰衣草香水味则浸透了墙壁，穿透他的肺腑。

A sparse few photos hung upon simple white plaster: their wedding day – and the night they had brought Shinji home. Upon the mantle piece over the fireplace sat her violin; red wood lighted with warm streaks of gold and cherry, sleek and polished. Though he noticed, with some annoyance, that one of the strings had snapped.  
稀疏的几张照片挂在简单的白色灰泥墙上：他们的婚礼那天——以及他们带真嗣回家的那个夜晚。壁炉架上摆放着她的提琴；红木在温暖的金色和樱桃色条纹下闪耀，光滑而光亮。尽管他有些恼火地注意到，其中一根弦已经断裂。

It was so quiet. 四周静得可怕。

Even the slow, oscillating pattern of the ceiling fan couldn't keep it at bay anymore, turning into yet more empty noise. It broke into the house, pouring over every inch and worming its way into his ears. His hands began to tremble and his heart beat faster and faster as his chest swelled – plugging his throat. Gendo clasped his hands over his ears as it crept over him in shuddering tides. He bent over, eyes squeezed shut while his shoulders shook with soundless sobs.  
就连那缓慢摆动的吊扇也无法再将其驱散，转而化作更多空洞的噪音。它侵入屋内，淹没每一寸空间，钻入他的耳中。他的双手开始颤抖，心跳越来越快，胸口膨胀——堵住了喉咙。源堂双手紧捂耳朵，随着那颤抖的浪潮袭来。他弯下腰，双眼紧闭，肩膀无声地抽搐着。

The ringing silence persisted, but as with his quiet grief, eventually subsided. The world seemed to come back to sound and feeling, though his chest felt no less numb.  
那持续的寂静回响着，但如同他无声的悲痛，最终还是平息了。世界似乎恢复了声音和感觉，尽管他的胸口依旧麻木。

Gendo slid his hands down his face, a half-hearted attempt to clear his watery vision and streaked cheeks. He sniffed and folded his hands, blinking several times as his eyes drifted to the coffee table at his knees, sliding lethargically over the manila folders spread across it. Then they snapped back, a name catching his eye.  
源堂将双手从脸上滑下，半心半意地试图清除模糊的视线和斑驳的面颊。他吸了吸鼻子，双手交叠，眨了几次眼，目光懒洋洋地飘向膝前的咖啡桌，滑过上面散布的牛皮纸文件夹。随即目光猛地收回，一个名字吸引了他的注意。

_Keel.  
_  
He thought he could be strong enough.  
他以为自己足够坚强。

Shinji didn't deserve to be growing up around so much hate and death. But Gendo had helped bring him into this world. Because of him, his mother had been taken away. The accusation snapped a cord in his heart, twisting his veins with virulent malice and disgust. What was he supposed to do – _how_ was he supposed to raise this child alone?  
真嗣不该在这样的仇恨与死亡中成长。但源堂亲手将他带到了这个世界。因为他的缘故，真嗣的母亲被夺走了。这一指控如同一根绷紧的弦在心中断裂，他的血管被剧毒的恶意和厌恶扭曲。他该怎么办——他该如何独自抚养这个孩子？

That night, Gendo Ikari did not sleep, haunted by the hatred in the eyes of the boy down the hall.  
那一夜，碇源堂未能入眠，被走廊那头男孩眼中的恨意所困扰。

---

He hated their living room.  
他讨厌他们的客厅。

There was a new coffee stain on the white couch and it wasn't even from the child, who'd been taught early on to be wary of making such messes. The long low-end table was a glorified dumping ground for anything and everything, miscellaneous piles of half packed moving boxes stacked high on either side of the entertainment system. At some point, he recalled as if grasping for a dream, that this had been a comforting place.  
白色沙发上又多了一块新的咖啡渍，甚至不是孩子造成的，他早已被教导要小心避免这样的混乱。那张长长的低端茶几成了名副其实的杂物堆放地，各种杂七杂八的半打包搬家箱子高高地堆在娱乐系统两侧。不知何时，他依稀记得，这里曾是一个令人安心的地方，仿佛在追寻一个遥远的梦境。

It had endured the One Year War and various marital squabbles. Gendo had been sitting in the armchair there three years ago with Shinji in his lap, watching the television as a news anchor informed Japan that Tokyo had just been attacked. He'd felt the tremors and thought it little more than an earthquake. The pillar of smoke had risen over the hills shortly after and his stomach might as well have been voided.  
它经历了为期一年的大战和各种家庭纷争。三年前，碇源堂曾坐在那张扶手椅上，膝上坐着真嗣，看着电视新闻主播告知日本东京刚刚遭受了攻击。他感受到了震动，以为是普通的地震。不久后，烟柱在山丘上升起，他的胃仿佛被掏空了一般。

The anchor broke the news uneasily. Japan had suffered its third nuclear bombing.  
主播不安地播报了这个消息。日本遭受了第三次核弹轰炸。

He'd learned they were not the only ones and had spent several days glued to the television, ushered out to attend to his worldly responsibilities only at Yui's quiet insistence. Each night he learned of more sprawling cities that had been turned into ashen planes, of the desert capitals in the middle east - now silent glass craters. Not even the United States had made it through unscathed.  
他得知他们并非唯一受难者，连续几天紧盯着电视，只有在唯的轻声催促下才出门履行世俗责任。每晚他都得知更多繁华都市变成了灰烬平原，中东的沙漠首都——如今是寂静的玻璃弹坑。就连美国也未能幸免于难。

Now, Shinji was off with his tutor as usual, while Gendo again neglected his duties and the chores that needed doing around the house. When the boy returned, they would eat in silence and Gendo would dismiss him to his room, as was also becoming ritual. Night by night he came to resent this burden more and more.  
现在，真嗣像往常一样和家教出去了，而源堂再次忽视了他的职责和家中需要做的杂务。当男孩回来时，他们会沉默地吃饭，然后源堂会像往常一样打发他回房间。夜复一夜，他对这个负担越来越感到怨恨。

There was a notion in him, stirring as the fledgling tides of the sea. To reach out and speak. To do any of the things that had once been so easy and mundane. Nothing ever came of these efforts, where he forgot to shave and snubbed the opportunity to shower. Some days he could not even be bothered to eat.  
他心中有一种念头，像初生的海潮一样涌动。想要伸出手去说话。去做那些曾经如此轻松和普通的事情。这些努力从未有结果，他忘记了刮胡子，错过了洗澡的机会。有些日子，他甚至懒得吃饭。

When his body had had enough, when his legs carried him into their bedroom – that awful room that smelled like her, that disappointed him every time he did not find her in bed – he returned to the task at hand with mindless purpose. The task of discarding his old life.  
当他的身体受够了，当他的双腿带他走进他们的卧室——那个可怕的房间，闻起来像她，每次他没在床上找到她都让他失望——他无意识地回到了手头的任务。抛弃旧生活的任务。

While rifling through their things, he came across the old tape player he'd thought lost ages ago. This particular player was one of the newer models, bought for him by Yui for a birthday he'd stopped caring about decades ago.  
在翻找他们的物品时，他意外发现了那台久以为已遗失的旧磁带播放器。这款播放器是较新的型号，是多年前他已不再在乎的生日时，由唯送给他的礼物。

Thankfully, the mixtapes he had never found the heart to get rid of were still compatible with the more compact portable players. For the first time in years he listened to the jaunty tunes of Sakamoto, understanding the words with a new ear. How his mother had changed the lyrics as a final parting gift.  
幸好，那些他一直舍不得丢弃的混音磁带仍与更小巧的便携播放器兼容。多年来他首次聆听了坂本那欢快的曲调，以一种全新的心境理解了歌词。他的母亲是如何改变歌词作为最后的告别礼物。

It did not lift his heart to hear it, yet the old words brought comfort, somehow. He spent his nights here now, in this blasted living room, clutching his SDAT the way a smoker clung reverently to his cigarette pack. But tonight, he was reading. The research files that had landed in a heap on the coffee table were open in a mess of precise medical jargon. Incoherent gibberish to anyone else, but ordered chaos to him.  
听到这些旧词并未让他的心情好转，但不知为何却带来了些许安慰。如今他夜夜在此，在这被诅咒的客厅里，紧握着他的 SDAT，如同烟民虔诚地抓着烟盒。但今晚，他在阅读。散落在咖啡桌上的研究文件摊开成一片混乱，充斥着精确的医学术语。对其他人来说是无意义的胡言乱语，对他而言却是井然有序的混沌。

It was the Eva. 那是 Eva。

Always the Eva. 永远是 Eva。

It was the key to everything.  
它是解开一切的关键。

Three months later, the new year rolled over.  
三个月后，新年悄然来临。

It was February and Japan should have been shaking off the residuals of winter. Instead, the morning air was raw and humid in the pine laden valley of Hakone. The mists hung lower over the bare skeleton of a city and the cries of the cranes reached far across the serene countryside, not yet disturbed by the blaring of construction.  
二月本应是日本摆脱冬季余寒的时候。然而，在装点着松树的箱根山谷中，清晨的空气却异常湿冷。雾气低垂在城市的骨架之上，鹤鸣声悠扬地传遍了宁静的乡村，尚未被建筑工地的喧嚣所打扰。

Gendo waited at the train station, holding Shinji's tiny hand in his. Fuyutsuki stood on the other side of the boy.  
源渡在火车站等待着，紧握着真嗣的小手。冬月则站在男孩的另一侧。

"Don't you think a father is what he needs right now?" the elder asked, bordering contempt.  
"你不觉得他现在需要的是一个父亲吗？" 长者问道，语气中带着一丝轻蔑。

"No," Gendo said, staring off into the fog. "He'll be better off."  
"不，" 源渡说，目光穿透迷雾。"他会过得更好。"

Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted the unconvinced look Fuyutsuki made, but no further protest left his lips. Instead, he said, "Just answer me one thing: why Germany?"  
他眼角的余光瞥见了冬月脸上不以为然的神情，但没有更多的抗议从他口中说出。相反，他说道："只需回答我一个问题：为什么是德国？"

"He must be able to pilot if the need should arise."  
"如果需要的话，他必须能够驾驶。"

The man flinched as if stabbed. "Ikari..."  
那人像被刺了一样退缩。"伊卡里..."

"The Second is no older. We'll gather all of the necessary data while everything is being prepared."  
"第二位也不年长。我们会在一切准备就绪时收集所有必要的数据。"

The man's eyes narrowed, his expression hardening. "It's just an all too convenient excuse, isn't it?"  
男人的眼神变得锐利，表情也变得冷硬。“这不过是个太过方便的借口，不是吗？”

Gendo cast his gaze down at Shinji, who was still rubbing the sleep from his eyes. A narrow rail-car soon squealed into its berth, announcements droning with it. "Grab your things," he said. Little Shinji did as he was told, struggling as he hefted the oversized duffel bag.  
源渡低头看着还在揉眼睛的真嗣。一辆狭窄的轨道车很快尖叫着停靠到位，广播声随之响起。“拿好你的东西，”他说。小真嗣照做了，费力地提起那个过大的行李袋。

"Where we going?" he asked.  
“我们要去哪儿？”他问道。

"You are going away for a while."  
“你要离开一段时间。”

Shinji flinched, eyes wide. "But – I don't wanna'!"  
真嗣畏缩了一下，眼睛睁得大大的。“但是——我不想走！”

The train doors parted, revealing a man in a long-sleeved white button shirt and black khakis, hair shaved close to his head. The boy's tutor.  
列车门打开，一个穿着长袖白衬衫和黑色卡其裤、头发剃得很短的男人出现在眼前。那是男孩的导师。

"Inside," Gendo said in his quietly firm voice, a hand pushing against Shinji's back.  
“进去，”碇源堂用他那平静而坚定的声音说道，一只手推着真嗣的背。

His bag dropped as his fists went to his eyes. "But why?" he whimpered, trying to wipe away gathering tears.  
他的书包掉在了地上，拳头捂住了眼睛。“但是为什么？”他啜泣着，试图擦去涌出的泪水。

Something twisted in him and a gnawing pit formed in Gendo's stomach, his hands trembling. He stuffed them in his pockets, eyes lingering on Shinji only a moment longer. One that stretched on forever, spanning nearly a hundred breaths. In that instance, he felt doubt, fear – anger. A torrent of emotion swept over him, though failed to move his impassive features.  
某种情绪在他心中扭曲，碇源堂的胃里形成了一个啃噬的空洞，双手颤抖。他将手塞进口袋，目光在真嗣身上多停留了一会儿。那一刻仿佛永恒，跨越了近百次呼吸。在那瞬间，他感受到了怀疑、恐惧——还有愤怒。一股情感的洪流席卷了他，尽管未能动摇他那冷漠的表情。

That night he had struck his son threw him away from the station and its hissing air compressors, standing him in their house again to watch as Shinji ran from him screaming, _"I hate you!"  
那晚，他打了儿子，将他从车站及其嘶嘶作响的空气压缩机旁推开，让他再次站在家中，看着真嗣尖叫着逃离他，喊着：“我恨你！”  
_  
Gendo stiffened, hands clenching as he clung to resolution before hesitation could snare him again. There was nothing the boy would gain from him. Not as a father.  
碇源堂僵硬了，双手紧握，他紧抓着决心，以免犹豫再次缠住他。那孩子从他这里得不到任何东西。不是作为一个父亲。

That was something he could never be.  
那是他永远无法成为的角色。

"You mustn't run away, Shinji," he said and fished the old SDAT player from his jacket pocket, taking a knee and putting it in little Shinji's grasp. He stood straight, sliding his hands in his pockets again to keep them from shaking as he turned and began walking down the platform, Fuyutsuki at his side.  
"你不能逃跑，真嗣，"他说着从夹克口袋里掏出旧的 SDAT 播放器，单膝跪下，把它放在小真嗣的手中。他站直身子，再次将双手插进口袋，以抑制颤抖，然后转身开始沿着站台走去，冬月副司令在他身旁。

"Dad!" Shinji cried, small hands fighting tears, "don't leave me dad! Please, I'm sorry – I'm sorry!"  
"爸爸！"真嗣哭喊着，小手擦着泪水，"别离开我，爸爸！求你了，对不起——对不起！"

Gendo kept his head up as he walked.  
碇源堂继续昂首前行。

Shinji held his knees to his chest, staring down at his white shoes. There was a black streak he thought he should wipe away, unable to muster the will to move unless prompted. The train ride had been really long and he had been asleep most of the plane trip – wherever it was he was going with his Teacher. It seemed like he was being taken to the other side of the world.  
真嗣将双膝抱在胸前，盯着脚上的白色鞋子。鞋上有一道黑色的痕迹，他认为应该擦掉，但除非有人提醒，否则他提不起劲去动。火车之旅非常漫长，他在飞机上大部分时间都在睡觉——无论他和老师要去哪里。感觉像是被带到了世界的另一端。

"We're here." “我们到了。”

Shinji looked up and found everything was brighter, sky-touching trees making the sun wink as they passed by. He had to twist in his seat belt, wishing he was grown-up sized.  
真嗣抬头一看，发现一切都变得明亮起来，高耸入云的树木在他们经过时让阳光闪烁。他不得不扭动着安全带，希望自己能长大一些。

In a moment the glowing countryside whisked his discomfort away.  
顷刻间，那闪耀的乡间景色便将他的不适一扫而空。

Beyond the road stretched fields of pale green and autumn gold, rolling up to a house – Shinji's brow furrowed in thought – three stories tall! It was like no house he'd ever seen, made up of rough white stone. With its squat, heavy shapes, it appeared to have been squished between the hands of a giant at some point, squeezing its tiny windows together, the edges of which were rimmed with red bricks. Spires poked up from its steep rain-gray roof, where the fingers of green vines clawed up the walls to touch them.  
道路之外，是一片淡绿与秋金交织的田野，绵延至一座房屋——真嗣眉头紧锁，陷入沉思——那是一座三层楼高的建筑！它与真嗣所见过的任何房屋都截然不同，由粗糙的白色石头砌成。其矮胖厚重的轮廓，仿佛曾被巨人的双手挤压过，将狭小的窗户紧紧挤在一起，窗框边缘镶嵌着红砖。尖塔从陡峭的灰瓦屋顶上探出，绿藤的触须攀爬在墙面上，试图触及它们。

"Where are we?" he asked, face pressed to the glass.  
“我们在哪儿？”他脸贴着玻璃问道。

"I will tell you when you sit properly," Teacher said. Shinji's shoulders sagged, but he did as he was told and the man nodded. "This is the Langley estate. The Colonel is very generously providing us with housing here."  
"等你坐好了我再告诉你，"老师说道。真嗣的肩膀耷拉下来，但还是照做了，男人点头示意。"这里是兰格利庄园。上校非常慷慨地为我们提供了住所。"

Shinji's face scrunched. "Why?"  
真嗣皱起眉头。"为什么？"

"It is what your father wishes," Teacher said and Shinji sank in his seat a little, staring at the car door as weariness pulled at his body. He reached into the pockets of his shorts, one hand finding the music player father had given him.  
"这是你父亲的意愿，"老师说，真嗣在座位上微微下沉，疲惫感让他盯着车门。他伸手摸进口袋，一只手找到了父亲给他的音乐播放器。

The vehicle squealed to a stop.  
车辆尖叫着停了下来。

"Come," Teacher said. “过来，”老师说。

Waiting for them was a tall man with an ugly face; all square and more than a little wrinkly. There must have been something wrong with him, because he didn't look like anyone else Shinji had ever met. Teacher approached and bowed. The man did the same and then they shook hands, speaking... something. Those weren't words! That was just gibberish!  
等待他们的是一个高大且面容丑陋的男人；四方脸庞，皱纹不少。他肯定有什么问题，因为他的长相与真嗣见过的任何人都不同。老师走上前鞠了一躬。那人也回了一礼，然后他们握手，说着...什么。那不是话！那只是胡言乱语！

The man then motioned to Shinji and Teacher nodded, face stretching into a smile as he indulged the boy with a slight bow. Shinji looked to Teacher, who motioned impatiently for him to do the same.  
那人随即示意真嗣，老师点头微笑，微微鞠躬以示对男孩的宠爱。真嗣看向老师，后者不耐烦地示意他也同样行礼。

The man chuckled as he did. "It's nice to meet you, _junger_ Shinji."  
那人笑着回应。"很高兴见到你，年轻的真嗣。"

_Junger_? Shinji wondered, straightening up a little, awaiting explanation as he looked from one to the other. The two continued their conversation, forgetting about him entirely. The taller man made a few gestures, pointing somewhere beyond the big house.  
年轻的？真嗣有些疑惑，稍稍挺直身子，期待着解释，目光在两人之间来回扫视。两人继续他们的对话，完全忘记了他的存在。高个子男人做了几个手势，指向大房子外的某个地方。

"Come along, Shinji," Teacher said, pulling the boy from his gazing. As they walked by, Shinji noticed a little girl in a black dress frowning at him from the open doorway. He stopped to stare at her – that red hair and big blue eyes.  
“快来，真嗣，”老师说道，将男孩从凝视中拉回。他们走过时，真嗣注意到一个穿黑裙的小女孩在敞开的门口皱眉看着他。他停下脚步盯着她——那红发和大大的蓝眼睛。

The girl sniffed and ran out of sight.  
女孩吸了吸鼻子，跑得不见了踪影。

_Red_. He thought, struck dumb on the spot. _Red like fire_. Shinji turned to Teacher, only to find he had been left behind. His short legs struggled to catch up. "Who– who was that girl?"  
红色。他愣在原地，哑口无言。红得像火一样。真嗣转头看向老师，却发现已被落在后面。他那双短腿努力追赶着。“那女孩——她是谁？”

"Never you mind," he said, leading the way through a winding path of archways wrapped with white flowered vines. The looming castle was steadily consumed by the trees and bushes of purple and yellow, which spilled strange stinging scents into his nose. He sniffed and itched, which only made it itch all the more.  
“别担心，”他说着，领着路穿过一条蜿蜒的小径，两旁是缠绕着白色花藤的拱门。那座巍峨的城堡逐渐被紫黄相间的树木和灌木吞没，散发出一种奇怪的刺鼻香气，钻进他的鼻孔。他嗅了嗅，又挠了挠，结果反而更痒了。

There were many pathways and he was thankful that at least Teacher knew where they were going. At the same time, Shinji couldn't help but wonder what lay beyond. Smaller trees reached over the smelly bushes, cooling lily-pad laden ponds with their shade. Slowly the world shifted in shape and color as the trees grew taller and their trunks grew fatter.  
这里有许多小径，幸好老师知道他们要去哪里，这让真嗣感到庆幸。与此同时，他不禁好奇小径的另一头是什么。较小的树木伸展枝叶，覆盖在散发着异味的灌木上，为漂满睡莲的池塘带来荫凉。随着树木越长越高，树干越来越粗，周围的世界也在慢慢变换着形状和色彩。

Shinji glanced back, glad the stone castle was still in sight. But even that became distant as they reached a tiny, albeit more familiar, house like the ones where he lived. It was then that he noticed the sky had begun to darken, dyeing everything shades of yellow and orange as the sun shrank away. The tallest spires of the castle poked over the tall trees, but he couldn't see much beyond the alien bushes and hulking trunks. Keys jangled and something clicked, Teacher calling him inside. Shinji hesitated at the threshold, staring down at that small line between concrete and wood. His feet and knees felt tight, as if someone had glued his shoes to the ground. Eyes traveling up again, he was met with darkness and s shadow he recognized as Teacher.  
真嗣回头望去，庆幸那座石堡仍在视线中。但随着他们来到一栋虽小却更熟悉的房子前，那石堡也变得遥远起来，就像他曾居住过的那些房屋一样。这时他注意到天空开始暗淡下来，太阳渐渐隐去，将万物染成黄橙交错的色调。城堡最高的尖塔穿透高耸的树木，但在异样的灌木丛和粗壮的树干之外，他看不清更多。钥匙叮当作响，伴随着一声轻响，老师叫他进屋。真嗣在门槛处犹豫不决，凝视着混凝土与木地板之间的那条细线。他的脚和膝盖感到紧绷，仿佛有人将他的鞋子粘在了地上。目光再次上移，他面对的是一片黑暗和一个他认得的身影——老师。

"Shinji," Teacher said and a light snapped on, casting his tall caretaker in black, but bathing all else in an orange glow.  
“真嗣，”老师说道，随即灯光一亮，将他高大的看护人映衬成黑色，但周围的一切都被橙色的光芒笼罩。

"Why... can't I..." he started, but couldn't get the words past the brick in his throat.  
“为什么...我不能...”他开口道，但喉咙里的那块砖让他无法继续说下去。

"This is your home now."  
“这里现在是你的家了。”

Shinji swallowed, but the lump didn't pass and he stepped inside. The walls were far too tall, or maybe the rooms were just too empty. His house had lots of stuff. His room had lots of stuff.  
真嗣咽了咽口水，但那团东西并未消失，他踏进了屋内。墙壁显得异常高大，或许是房间太空旷了吧。他的家有很多东西，他的房间也堆满了物品。

Teacher turned to the right, sliding open a door to what must have been his room, a musty smell creeping forth. He set down Shinji's duffel bag and walked past him down the hall. "Go to bed now. Your studies will begin first thing in the morning." then he disappeared to the other end of the house.  
老师转向右边，拉开了一扇门，那一定是他的房间，一股霉味随之飘出。他把真嗣的行李袋放下，然后沿着走廊走过他身边。“现在去睡觉吧。明早第一件事就是开始你的学习。”随后他消失在屋子的另一头。

Shinji wandered into his room, grimacing at the lumpy looking futon. There was a small black table in the left corner and an empty closet to his right.  
真嗣漫不经心地走进自己的房间，皱眉看着那床看起来凹凸不平的被褥。房间左角放着一张小黑桌，右边则是一个空荡荡的衣柜。

Shinji turned back to the hallway and the closed door far beyond it. He reached for the panel, struggling as it got stuck along the floor. With a final push, he managed to slam it closed before falling on his rump. Something thumped along the carpet, the black SDAT player lying behind him. He twisted and picked the thing up, the wires curling between his fingers.  
真嗣回头望向走廊和远处紧闭的门。他伸手去拉门板，却发现它卡在了地板上。最后用力一推，他终于将门砰地一声关上，随即跌坐在地上。地毯上传来一声闷响，黑色的 SDAT 播放器躺在他身后。他扭过身捡起那东西，电线在他指间蜷曲。

The plastic frame creaked as he squeezed it, skin hotter than a sun – and he cast it across the room.  
他用力挤压塑料外壳，发出吱吱声，手上的热度仿佛太阳一般——然后他猛地将它扔向房间的另一头。

He regretted it immediately, scrambling to snatch the player up as it clacked against the wall and bounced over the floor. He turned it upside down and over, making sure there were no cracks or loose wires.  
他立刻后悔了，急忙去抓起播放器，它咔嗒一声撞在墙上，又弹跳着滚过地板。他把播放器翻来覆去检查，确保没有裂缝或松动的电线。

It was still together. It was still whole.  
它依然完好无损。它依然完整无缺。

Shinji pressed it to his chest, unable to keep his lips from shaking or his shoulders from trembling. With one heaving gasp, the tears started tumbling down his cheeks and he cried in an empty room with nothing but his father's SDAT for comfort.  
真嗣将它紧贴在胸前，无法抑制嘴唇的颤抖和肩膀的抖动。随着一声沉重的喘息，泪水开始顺着他的脸颊滚落，他在空荡荡的房间里，只有父亲的 SDAT 陪伴，放声哭泣。

---

A light _taptaptap_ pulled Shinji from his dreams, casting him bleary-eyed into the world. He sat up on the floor, one hand rubbing his eyes while the other still clutched the SDAT player tight. The tapping came again and this time his door slid open to reveal Teacher, clad in a white button long-sleeved shirt and black pants.  
一阵轻柔的咚咚声将真嗣从梦中唤醒，他睡眼惺忪地回到了现实世界。他坐在地板上，一只手揉着眼睛，另一只手仍紧紧抓着 SDAT 播放器。敲击声再次响起，这次他的房门缓缓打开，露出了穿着白色长袖衬衫和黑色裤子的老师。

"Change your clothes and then we will begin your lessons," he said, sliding the door shut.  
“换好衣服，然后我们开始上课，”他说着，将门轻轻关上。

Shinji blinked, searching for his duffel bag. Finding fresh new clothes, he changed and, not really knowing where to put the dirty ones, threw them to a corner of the room. When he left, Teacher was kneeled at a low table piled with books. He motioned for Shinji to sit on the pillow across from him.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，寻找着自己的旅行袋。找到干净的新衣服后，他换了衣服，却不太清楚脏衣服该放哪儿，便随手扔到了房间的一角。当他出来时，老师正跪在堆满书本的矮桌前。他示意真嗣坐在对面的坐垫上。

"Do you know where we are?" he asked.  
"你知道我们在哪儿吗？" 他问道。

Several answers came to mind, but Shinji just shook his head.  
脑海中闪过几个答案，但真嗣只是摇了摇头。

"It is a country called Germany. Since you will be living here for an extended period, you must learn the native language. Thus, in addition to your normal vocabulary and pronunciation lessons, you will start learning German as well," Teacher explained, patting one of the books on the table.  
"这是一个叫做德国的国家。既然你将在这里长期居住，你必须学习当地的语言。因此，除了你的常规词汇和发音课程外，你还将开始学习德语，" 老师解释道，轻拍着桌上的一本书。

"Why do I have to live here?"  
“为什么我必须住在这里？”

"Because it has been deemed necessary. No more questions now."  
“因为这是必要的。现在不要再问问题了。”

Shinji wanted to ask lots of questions, but Teacher waved them away as he was busied with the book full of not-right characters, where he learned how to say 'good morning' in German. But his pronunciation, as Teacher said, required extensive work. He wasn't sure what that meant, but Teacher didn't look pleased with him when he said the weird words.  
真嗣想问很多问题，但老师挥手打发了他，因为他正忙着看一本满是奇怪字符的书，在那里他学会了用德语说“早上好”。但正如老师所说，他的发音需要大量改进。他不太明白那是什么意思，但当他说出那些奇怪的词时，老师看起来对他并不满意。

It seemed to take forever for the sun to crawl up into this other sky, so long he could have sworn another day had passed by while his stomach grumbled. Teacher made soup that tasted like ash and syrup. At least, that's what he imagined ash and syrup would taste like together. It did little for his hunger and afterwards Teacher gave him permission to play outside.  
太阳似乎花了无尽的时间才缓缓爬上这片陌生的天空，久到他几乎以为又过去了一天，而他的肚子还在咕咕作响。老师做的汤尝起来像灰烬和糖浆混合的味道。至少，他想象中灰烬和糖浆混合起来就是这种味道。这并没有缓解他的饥饿，之后老师允许他出去玩。

Shinji stepped out of the front door, where several gray stones sat among a small sea of white rocks. Beyond that there were boulders jutting through the greenery, broken by woodchip pathways that led into bunches of trees with mossy heads of hair. Even further in there were other plants and bugs not unlike the ones at home. He was glad, however, to see the horned beetles were missing.  
真嗣走出前门，几块灰色的石头散布在一片白色的小石海中。再远处，绿意中突起几块巨石，被木屑小径分割，通向一簇簇长满苔藓的树丛。更深处还有其他植物和昆虫，与家乡的颇为相似。不过，他很高兴没有看到那些带角的甲虫。

In the distance, on high and lording over it all, was the stone house that stood like a castle.  
远处，高高在上，俯瞰一切的，是一座宛如城堡的石屋。

His right hand tightened around the SDAT and he marched forward, cautiously, ready to bolt at the first sign of trouble. He ventured down one of the safer looking paths, set wider apart than the others and lined with cobblestones.  
他的右手紧紧握住 SDAT，小心翼翼地向前走去，随时准备在出现麻烦的第一时间逃跑。他选择了一条看起来相对安全的小径，这条路比其他路径更宽，两边铺着鹅卵石。

The plants became stranger and stranger as he went. Narrow things with flat leaves, or stubbier ones with sharp stalks and pointy frills. The flowers were what really took his breath away – so many and in more colors than he even knew existed. Some looked like the water birds with the long legs that bent backwards, while others appeared to be balls of honeycomb. His nose began to itch with the plethora of new smells, becoming red and stuffy again.  
随着他深入，植物变得越来越奇特。有的细长扁叶，有的矮胖且茎秆尖锐、边缘锋利。而那些花朵更是让他惊叹不已——如此之多，颜色之丰富超乎他的想象。有些像长腿反曲的水鸟，而另一些则像是蜂巢球。大量新奇的气味让他的鼻子开始发痒，再次变得红肿堵塞。

The earth started to slope down and the pathway became less defined, giving way to wandering roots. Thin, spindly white trees stretched up higher than he could see into the canopies above, while a sea of orange ferns grew around the base of their trunks. A wind darted through the garden, clacking branches together and making the woods creak.  
地面开始向下倾斜，小径逐渐模糊，取而代之的是四处蔓延的树根。细长苍白的树木高耸入云，树冠在他视线之外，而树干底部则是一片橙色的蕨类海洋。一阵风穿过花园，树枝相互碰撞，森林发出吱嘎声。

The foliage rustled further down the path and Shinji froze – jumping as a snake slithered onto the overgrown trail, its body slick and black. The thing seemed not to notice him as he staggered back, relieved it was heading in the opposite direction further into the valley.  
树叶在小径更深处沙沙作响，真嗣顿时僵住了——一条蛇滑行到杂草丛生的小路上，身体光滑而乌黑。那东西似乎没有注意到他，当他踉跄后退时，庆幸它正朝着相反的方向深入山谷。

The call of his name echoed over the garden and Shinji couldn't run fast enough back to his new house. He had not strayed far, and Teacher was waiting at the door to usher him in.  
他的名字在花园中回荡，真嗣拼命跑回新家。他没有走远，老师正站在门口迎接他进去。

That night Shinji was in his room again, straining his ears for familiar sounds. The legions of cicadas had gone silent while a handful of crickets chirped, barely discernible over the humming of the frogs and their warbling voices. They'd never been this noisy at home.  
那晚，真嗣再次待在自己的房间里，竖起耳朵倾听熟悉的声音。蝉群已经静默，只有几只蟋蟀在鸣叫，几乎被青蛙的呱呱声和颤音淹没。在家时，它们从未如此吵闹。

_Home_. He thought, wondering about his things and his bed and his toys. His favorite had been a black armored Samurai who went to space to fight aliens, but didn't age like other people did. In the show, he fought for so long that his home planet changed to become alien to him, while everyone there forgot about him and the battles he fought.  
家。他想，想着他的东西、他的床和玩具。他最喜欢的是一个黑色装甲的武士，他去太空与外星人战斗，但不像其他人那样变老。在剧中，他战斗了太久，以至于他的家乡星球变得对他来说陌生，而那里的人们都忘记了他和他的战斗。

Shinji had ripped its arms and legs off in a fit. Was it still there, broken up on his bed? He wished he had brought it with him, but he didn't know how to fix it. Was that why he'd been sent away? Because he broke things?  
真嗣在一次发作中扯掉了它的四肢。它还在那里，破碎地躺在他的床上吗？他希望自己能带上它，但他不知道怎么修理。这就是他被送走的原因吗？因为他弄坏了东西？

A feeling like ice water spiraled down his back and he sat down, hugging his knees close. That must have been it. No one would want a boy who broke things. That's why he'd been sent away to this... other place, far away. The thought made his lips quiver, a warm sting touching his cheeks. He wished he knew how to fix himself. Maybe then his father would let him go back home.  
一种冰水般的感觉在他背后盘旋，他坐下来，紧紧抱住膝盖。一定是这样。没有人会想要一个会弄坏东西的男孩。这就是他被送到这个...遥远的地方的原因。这个想法让他的嘴唇颤抖，脸颊上感到一阵温暖的刺痛。他希望自己知道如何修复自己。也许那样他的父亲就会让他回家。

The door to his room slid open and Teacher was there, standing over him. "You mustn't cry, Shinji. You must be a good boy from now on."  
他房间的门滑开了，老师站在那里，俯视着他。“你不可以哭，真嗣。从现在开始，你必须做个好孩子。”

Little Shinji nodded, trying to wipe away his tears.  
小真嗣点点头，努力擦去眼泪。

---

Despite his best attempts, Shinji had barely slept. Everything hurt and he was tired and his eyes burned and he hated this place. But Teacher didn't care. It was time for lessons.  
尽管尽了最大努力，真嗣几乎没睡。全身都疼，他又累，眼睛也烧得难受，他讨厌这个地方。但老师并不在乎。是时候上课了。

The minutes stretched by and the lessons seemed harder. When he started to throw a fit, Teacher whacked his knuckles with a ruler. Shinji felt the sting on his cheek too, from when...  
时间一分一秒地过去，课程似乎变得更加艰难。当他开始发脾气时，老师用尺子敲了他的指关节。真嗣也感觉到脸颊上的刺痛，那是从……

He behaved himself the rest of the day and as the sun started to sink, he was given an hour to himself before they resumed. He stood outside the small house again, the white rocks warm on his bare feet. An endless forest stretched out before him, bustling with birds and bugs. The snake from yesterday came to mind. He'd never seen one before outside of picture books. All he knew was that he didn't like them. This one had not been a very big one – and didn't have the rattle or patterned colors like in Teacher's books, all shimmering black scales as dark as night.  
他那天剩下的时间都表现得很规矩，当太阳开始下沉时，他被允许独自待上一个小时。他再次站在小屋外，白色的石头温暖着他赤裸的双脚。无边的森林在他面前延伸，鸟儿和昆虫在其中忙碌。昨天的那条蛇浮现在脑海中。他从未在图画书之外见过蛇。他所知道的就是他不喜欢它们。这条蛇并不大——也没有老师书中的响尾蛇或彩色斑纹，全身都是夜色般深邃的黑色鳞片。

SDAT secured once more in his pocket, Shinji ventured forth, trying to remember the trail he had taken last afternoon. The walk was longer than before and as he wandered into the valley that had no flowers, he began to think he was lost.  
SDAT 再次安全地放在口袋里，真嗣冒险前行，试图回忆昨天下午走过的那条小径。这次步行比之前更长，当他走进那个没有花朵的山谷时，他开始觉得自己迷路了。

He'd read stories like this, of children lured deep into the forests by spirits, never to be seen again. Here, the calls of the birds faded to echoes, and the fire-gold ferns seemed endless. He froze, straining his ears. The quiet was what told him he was in the right place. The ghostly white trees were like sentinels in the grove, keeping any that might have found shelter within their branches at bay.  
他曾读过这样的故事，孩子们被幽灵引诱深入森林，从此再无人见过。这里，鸟鸣声渐成回响，火金色的蕨类植物似乎无边无际。他僵立不动，竖耳倾听。正是这份寂静告诉他来对了地方。那些苍白的树木如同幽灵般的哨兵，守护着林中可能藏身的每一处枝桠。

He wanted to run, to just curl up and listen to his SDAT and dream the rest of the day away. But running would mean he would have to go back to that tiny house. Running would mean he would have to face Teacher and more lessons. Frowning, Shinji stepped into the grove, cautious – flinching at the crack of a branch or the squealing chitter of a squirrel. A whispering breeze chased the sun-baked air from the glade, shaking life into the still ferns along the forest floor.  
他想要逃跑，只想蜷缩起来听 SDAT，把剩下的日子在梦中度过。但逃跑意味着他必须回到那间狭小的房子。逃跑意味着他必须面对老师和更多的课程。皱着眉头，真嗣踏入林间空地，小心翼翼——对树枝的断裂声或松鼠的尖叫声都畏缩不前。一阵轻风驱散了林间被阳光烘烤的空气，唤醒了森林地面上静止的蕨类植物。

The black snake slithered free and Shinji's heart stuck in his throat, its beat thundering in his ears.  
那条黑蛇滑行而出，真嗣的心卡在了喉咙里，心跳如雷贯耳。

The serpent wiggled into the valley and Shinji almost lost it as he gave chase, careful not to make much noise and scare it off. Could snakes even get scared? It came into view again, a shadow moving between the shrubs and roots. As if sensing him it began to move faster, winding in that unnatural way off the beaten paths of mulch and pebbles.  
那条蛇扭动着钻进山谷，真嗣几乎要失控了，他紧随其后，小心翼翼地不发出太大声响，以免惊跑了它。蛇会害怕吗？它再次出现在视线中，一个影子在灌木和树根间移动。仿佛察觉到了他，它开始加速，以那种不自然的姿态绕开常走的腐叶和碎石小径。

Shinji crashed through a scratchy bushel that snagged his shirt and went tumbling, elbows scuffing as they scraped across stone. He groaned, pushing his now aching body up. He couldn't lose the snake.  
真嗣冲破了一丛刺人的灌木，衣服被勾住，摔倒了，手肘在石头上擦伤，留下痕迹。他呻吟着，推着现在疼痛不已的身体站起来。他不能让那条蛇逃走。

Shinji made it to his knees, searching, frantic – but it was gone. His small fist smacked into the stone.  
真嗣跪在地上，焦急地寻找着——但它已经不见了。他小小的拳头捶打在石头上。

Soon he stood and brushed off, new bruises coloring his knuckles. The flowers here changed to tints and shades of color unlike the bright, exotic hues near his house. Roses, he recalled, noticing the red ones right away. They skirted the edges of a wide stone walkway, stacked in front of one another, neat and ordered. The towering trunks sheltering the rest of the garden were absent, leaving the blue sky open and bare. Dark, pointed trees guarded the edges of the expanse and further back he could see a small dome with pillars, the castle having grown some in the background.  
很快他站起身，拍了拍身上的尘土，新添的瘀伤在他的拳头上显现。这里的花朵色彩变幻，与家附近那些鲜艳奇异的颜色截然不同。他立刻认出了玫瑰，尤其是那些红色的。它们沿着一条宽阔的石板路边缘排列，一排排整齐有序。高大的树干庇护着花园的其他部分，此刻却不见踪影，留下一片开阔而裸露的蓝天。深色的尖顶树木守卫着这片广阔的边缘，再往后，他能看到一个小圆顶和柱子，城堡在背景中似乎又长高了一些。

He meandered along the path, where roses on high bushes were perched atop their stalks. They made a series of rings around fountain bowls sprinkling water into a pond. Like a whisper, a sliver of color at the edge of sight called his eye. He was looking at the roses like before, but there was one flower that wasn't quite right. It had a green stalk and violet shades for its long, hanging frills struggling to grow within the gaps between the roses – which encased it in a cage of thorn-laced vines.  
他沿着小径漫步，高高的玫瑰丛立在枝头，环绕着喷泉的碗状结构，水花洒入池塘。如同耳语般，视野边缘的一抹色彩吸引了他的目光。他像之前一样看着玫瑰，但有一朵花显得不太对劲。它的茎是绿色的，长长的垂边呈现出紫色调，努力在玫瑰之间的缝隙中生长——这些玫瑰如同荆棘缠绕的牢笼，将它困在其中。

Lying next to the strange flower was something brown, white fluff sticking out of its torn chest. It was so stained and dirtied, he might never have noticed it was there if he'd just passed right by. Shinji picked the thing up and realized it was a monkey, or at least it used to be, before getting dirty and ripped up.  
躺在那朵奇异的花旁边的是一个棕色的物体，破损的胸口露出了白色的绒毛。它沾满了污渍和泥土，如果只是匆匆经过，他可能永远不会注意到它的存在。真嗣捡起那东西，发现它是一只猴子，或者至少曾经是，在变得肮脏和破烂之前。

He looked around, trying to find its owner. They must have been worried over it. Looking up towards the castle, he saw a shadow in one of the windows. It was hard to tell since he was so far away, but he could have sworn he saw a brief wisp of flame.  
他环顾四周，试图找到它的主人。他们一定很担心它。抬头望向城堡，他看到其中一个窗户里有一个影子。由于距离太远，很难确定，但他敢发誓他看到了一缕短暂的火焰。

---

It still smelled funny in Germany, thick and pungent, every intake hitting his nostrils with the force of a hurricane. Shinji sniffed, curling a little tighter in his small sanctuary, a squared out depression thick with soft grass. Most of the metal roof and walls had been worn away until sage and red splotches spattered what remained. The light from the sun still had difficulty reaching down through the thick branches high above.  
德国的空气依然闻起来很奇怪，浓烈而刺鼻，每一次呼吸都像飓风一样冲击着他的鼻孔。真嗣嗅了嗅，蜷缩在他小小的避难所里，一个被柔软草丛覆盖的方形凹陷处。大部分金属屋顶和墙壁已经磨损殆尽，只剩下斑驳的绿色和红色痕迹。阳光仍然难以穿透高高的茂密树枝，照射到地面。

It was quieter here and farther from the castle with the girl and the screaming.  
这里更安静，离那座有女孩和尖叫声的城堡也更远。

Teacher said he was not allowed to go to the big house. Probably because he was broken. That was why he was sent to this garden with no one in it. He had been bad and now he was being punished.  
老师说他不能去大房子。可能是因为他坏了。这就是为什么他被送到这个空无一人的花园。他做错了事，现在正在接受惩罚。

Sometimes, though, he would find his way towards it. Where the garden ended and the wood and stone platforms began. Sometimes, when he was there just looking up at the massive building, he heard a girl's voice echoing through what must have been grand halls. Maybe the girl he'd seen before?  
尽管如此，有时他会设法走向那里。在花园尽头，木石平台开始的地方。有时，当他站在那里仰望那座宏伟的建筑时，他会听到一个女孩的声音在可能是宏伟的大厅中回荡。或许是之前见过的那个女孩？

Face quirking, he fished out the SDAT and poked a bud in each ear.  
他嘴角一抽，掏出 SDAT，往每只耳朵里塞了个耳塞。

_Red hair_. 红发。

No one had red hair. She must have been a forest spirit. Only spirits had colored hair. But why did she live in the house? And why did she wear a dress? Ghosts didn't wear dresses... at least not like that. Ghosts were ugly too... and she wasn't ugly at all.  
没人有红发。她一定是森林精灵。只有精灵的头发才有颜色。但为什么她住在房子里？又为什么她穿着裙子？鬼魂不穿裙子……至少不是那样的。鬼魂也很丑……而她一点也不丑。

It didn't really matter all that much. Why would anyone up there care what he was doing down here? Still, he wished he had someone to play with. The only real playmate he had was the snake – and it was no playmate at all. More of an adversary, really. Maybe the reason no one came into the garden was because of the snake. Maybe they were afraid of it.  
其实这并不那么重要。为什么上面的人会在意他在下面做什么呢？尽管如此，他还是希望能有个玩伴。他唯一的真正玩伴是那条蛇——而它根本算不上玩伴，更像是对手。也许没人进入花园的原因就是因为那条蛇。也许他们害怕它。

That _must_ be it. 一定是这样。

As another day passed Shinji formulated what was, for a soon to be five-year-old, a brilliant plan. To begin, he set up a listening post from which to watch the snake. During his hour of recess, he went into the valley with the ghost trees, waiting for the slithering thing to appear. At the same time everyday it would come chasing out of the sunset ferns and travel down the narrow dirt path – up and out of the grove.  
随着又一天的过去，真嗣构思出了一个对于即将满五岁的他来说极为精妙的计划。首先，他设立了一个观察点来监视那条蛇。在课间休息的一个小时里，他走进了长满幽灵树的山谷，等待那滑行的生物出现。每天同一时间，它都会从夕阳蕨丛中窜出，沿着狭窄的土路——向上穿过树丛。

Shinji never chased it. Last time he followed it he'd gotten lost in those stone ruins by the castle. Yet it became more infuriating than anything to simply watch the snake. It was as though it were taunting him, smug in its assurance that he could neither catch it nor keep pace with it.  
真嗣从未追过它。上次他跟着它，结果在那座城堡旁的石废墟里迷了路。然而，眼睁睁看着这条蛇比什么都让人恼火。它仿佛在嘲弄他，自信满满地认为他既抓不住它也跟不上它。

Shinji would show that stupid snake.  
真嗣要给那条蠢蛇点颜色看看。

After perhaps a week, he was ready for the serpent when it wriggled free of the ferns, hiding behind one of the birch trees. Shinji pounced, fingers poised to snare the slithering creature. It moved like lightning, bolting beyond his falling trajectory before his hands even met the dirt. Even as it glided over the ground side to side, it didn't seemed perturbed by the incident in the slightest. Not even so much as an annoyed hiss. That just brought a snarl to Shinji's face.  
大约一周后，当那条蛇从蕨丛中蠕动出来，躲在一棵白桦树后面时，真嗣已经准备好了。他猛扑过去，手指准备抓住那滑溜的生物。它快如闪电，在他双手触地之前就逃出了他的坠落范围。即使它在地上左右滑行，也丝毫没有被刚才的事故所困扰。甚至连一声恼怒的嘶嘶声都没有。这反而让真嗣的脸上露出了怒吼。

The boy scrambled to his feet and ran after its black form. It only moved faster, darting between the plants in clever zig-zags. He chased it to no avail until his lungs stung from heaving breaths and his sides ached and his legs screamed for rest. Foliage smacked his face, branches snagging his clothes.  
男孩急忙站起身，追着那黑色的身影跑去。它移动得更快，灵巧地在植物间曲折穿梭。他追逐无果，直到肺部因急促的呼吸而刺痛，两侧疼痛，双腿也因疲惫而尖叫着要求休息。树叶抽打在他的脸上，树枝钩住了他的衣服。

Shinji's foot thwacked against something hard and he fell flat on his stomach. Pain pulsed through his left knee, arms matted with dirt. He groaned, looking for the cause of his fall, before realizing the SDAT had skittered from his pocket.  
真嗣的脚踢到了什么硬物，整个人扑倒在地。左膝传来一阵剧痛，双臂沾满了泥土。他呻吟着，寻找导致他跌倒的原因，随后意识到 SDAT 从口袋里滑落了。

It sat under the crux of a gnarled root, crumpled and oozing sap. He snatched it up quickly, lest the tree steal it from him. He searched the clearing for the snake – but it was gone, _again_.  
它蜷缩在一根扭曲的树根下，皱巴巴地渗出树液。他迅速捡起它，生怕树会把它夺走。他在空地上寻找那条蛇——但它又一次消失了。

Shinji blinked, craning his neck as he looked about. He hadn't been to this part of the garden yet. Thistles and thorn bushes closed off the clearing, wrapping around the other trees and plants to consume them in their biting embrace. All except the tree in the middle of the clearing, which they gave a wide berth.  
真嗣眨了眨眼，伸长脖子四处张望。他还没来过花园的这一部分。蓟和荆棘丛封闭了这片空地，环绕着其他树木和植物，在它们刺人的拥抱中吞噬它们。除了空地中央的那棵树，它们都避开了。

The thing could have been from another planet for all its strangeness, twisting up as though it were made of huge roots and vines that curled around one another. Not a proper trunk at all. Its stubby branches reached out in jagged arcs, tiny leaves gathered around bunches of small purple-black balls. He blinked, grimacing as he tried to remember the things mother used to pick off the trees for him –  
这东西的奇异程度，简直像是来自另一个星球，扭曲着向上生长，仿佛是由巨大的根和藤蔓缠绕而成。根本没有真正的树干。它那短小的枝条以锯齿状的弧度伸展开来，小小的叶子聚集在一簇簇紫黑色的球状果实周围。他眨了眨眼，皱着眉努力回忆母亲过去常从树上为他摘下的东西——

Apples! 苹果！

These, however, looked nothing like apples.  
然而，这些看起来一点也不像苹果。

Shinji collapsed by the base of the tree, legs too weak to hold him up anymore. His lungs were still starving for air and he obliged as best he could, wondering just how lost he was now. The snake had escaped him too. He'd done his best and even then he couldn't catch it!  
真嗣瘫倒在树根旁，双腿已无力支撑。他的肺部仍在渴望空气，他尽可能地满足，同时疑惑自己究竟迷失到了何种地步。那条蛇也逃脱了。他已竭尽全力，却依然无法捕捉到它！

As his expression twisted, he slapped his hands over his face, sliding them up into his hair and pulling. A frustrated growl clawed through his teeth before he let his hands fall into his lap.  
随着表情扭曲，他双手捂住脸，向上滑入发间并拉扯。一声沮丧的低吼从齿间迸发，随后他让双手垂落在膝上。

"Du weinst viel." "你哭得很厉害。"

Shinji jumped so fast he was sure his heart had popped out of his throat.  
真嗣跳得那么快，他确信自己的心脏已经从喉咙里蹦出来了。

He edged back, wide-eyed gaze fixed upon the yokai-girl standing at the other side of the tree, hands on her hips. Those strange eyes were staring at him and he felt himself shrink.  
他小心翼翼地后退，睁大眼睛盯着站在树另一边的妖怪女孩，双手叉腰。那双奇怪的眼睛正盯着他，他感到自己缩了起来。

"W-what?" he stuttered. "什-什么？" 他结巴道。

The girl's brow scrunched and her lips pouted. When he just stared – wishing his legs weren't frozen – her cheeks reddened and for a moment Shinji thought she might burst.  
女孩的眉头紧皱，嘴唇撅起。当他只是呆呆地盯着——希望自己的腿没有僵住——她的脸颊泛红，有那么一刻，真嗣以为她会哭出来。

"Cry – a lot," she said, pointing at him.  
"哭——很多，" 她指着他，说道。

Shinji wilted, perplexed all the same. He understood the words, but they didn't sound like they were supposed to. "No I don't," he said, rubbing his fists over his eyes, just to be sure there weren't any tears. There were.  
真嗣蔫了，同样感到困惑。他明白这些话，但听起来总觉得不对劲。“不，我不懂。”他说着，用拳头揉了揉眼睛，只为确认没有泪水。确实没有。

The girl didn't seem to understand what he said and he wished he could speak her weird sounds. Why didn't everyone say the same things? Maybe then she would want to play with him. Did she know he was broken?  
女孩似乎没听懂他说的话，他真希望自己能说她的奇怪语言。为什么大家不说同样的话呢？也许那样她就会想和他一起玩了。她知道他坏了吗？

The girl only stared, as if wary. Shinji fidgeted, now wishing she would go away. Instead, the girl stepped over the gnarled roots and shoved him. He fell to his back, anger tightening his veins only to start shivering with cold as the girl stood over him, icy blue eyes glaring.  
女孩只是盯着他，似乎很警惕。真嗣开始局促不安，现在只希望她离开。然而，女孩跨过扭曲的树根，推了他一把。他跌坐在地上，愤怒让血管紧绷，随即却因寒冷而颤抖，女孩站在他上方，冰蓝色的眼睛怒视着他。

"Wer bist du?!" she demanded. Shinji quirked his head and made a questioning sound, which only seemed to make her angrier. The girl leaned over to poke his chest – hard. "Nah-meh?" she asked. It took him a moment because she said it so funny, but then he realized–  
"你是谁？！" 她质问道。真嗣歪了歪头，发出一个疑问的声音，这似乎让她更生气了。女孩俯身用力戳了戳他的胸口。"名字？" 她问道。他愣了一下，因为她发音很有趣，但随后他意识到——

"S-Shinji," he squeaked. "我-我是真嗣，" 他结结巴巴地说。

She stood straight again, a finger touching her chin as she looked up. "Sh-in-ji," she repeated, nodding as she tested the name. Then, without warning, she snatched him by the wrist, drawing out a yelp as she tugged him to his feet. She was strong for a girl. He let himself be pulled along as she weaved a path back into the garden.  
她再次站直，用手指轻触下巴，抬头看着他。"真-嗣"，她重复着，点头尝试着这个名字。然后，毫无预警地，她抓住他的手腕，拉着他站起来，他发出一声惊呼。她作为一个女孩力气很大。他任由她拉着，穿过花园的小径。

When she stopped, he almost sent both of them flailing. Her eyes scanned him up and down, ferocious and alive. Then, still holding his arm, she jabbed a thumb at herself and declared, "Asuka!"  
她一停下，他差点让两人都摔倒。她的目光在他身上上下打量，凶猛而充满生机。随后，依旧抓着他的手臂，她用拇指戳了戳自己，宣布道：“明日香！”

### Chapter 2: Grafted 嫁接
Shinji hadn't seen her for six days.  
真嗣已经六天没见到她了。

At least, he thought it had been six days. He still had trouble telling time and six days seemed like long enough, even if it felt more like sixty-eight and a million. The sun seemed to stay out longer too, just to taunt him. He had asked Teacher about the girl one more time just the other day and as retribution was made to endure lessons past his bedtime. Sometimes he wished he could squish Teacher's head between his fingers. It was stuffy and stifling here and he didn't know anyone. Why had he been sent to this country?  
至少，他觉得是六天。他仍然难以分辨时间，六天似乎已经够长了，即便感觉更像六十八天甚至一百万天。太阳似乎也停留得更久，只是为了嘲弄他。前几天他又向老师问了一次那个女孩的事，结果作为惩罚，被迫熬到深夜才结束课程。有时他真希望自己能用手指把老师的头挤扁。这里闷热而压抑，他谁也不认识。为什么他被送到这个国家来？

_Because you're broken, dummy_. _That's why Asuka doesn't want to play with you anymore_. There really wasn't any other explanation. She probably thought he was simple and stupid, but that was okay. He wouldn't cry. He wouldn't run away. Where would he even run to? If his father didn't want a broken boy, who in the world would?  
因为你是个残缺的笨蛋。这就是为什么明日香不想再和你玩了。真的没有其他解释了。她大概觉得他既简单又愚蠢，但这没关系。他不会哭。他不会逃跑。他还能逃到哪里去呢？如果他的父亲不想要一个残缺的孩子，这世上还有谁会要呢？

The slap of a book drew his eyes up, finding Teacher's stern expression. "I suppose we will break for now, since you are clearly preoccupied."  
书本啪的一声合上，他的目光随之抬起，迎上了老师的严厉表情。“我想我们现在该休息一下，既然你显然心不在焉。”

"Sorry Teacher," he said.  
“对不起，老师，”他说。

Teacher only grunted, standing to make himself tea. He made tea a lot. Shinji wobbled to his feet, glancing from his room and then the door. Even the heavy, choking air brought by the scorching sun held more appeal than his empty room. He struggled to push the front door open, bringing a hand up to shield his eyes as he stepped out.  
老师只是哼了一声，起身去泡茶。他经常泡茶。真嗣摇摇晃晃地站起来，先是看了一眼自己的房间，然后是门口。就连烈日带来的沉重、窒息的空气，也比他空荡荡的房间更有吸引力。他费力地推开前门，举起一只手遮挡阳光，踏出门外。

A rock cracked into his head.  
一块石头砸中了他的头。

"Ow!" his hand flew up to grab the wound, head swinging side to side to find his attacker.  
“哎哟！”他手忙脚乱地捂住伤口，脑袋左右转动寻找袭击者。

"Ich hab dich!" Asuka cheered, grinning.  
“我抓到你了！”明日香欢呼道，咧嘴笑着。

Shinji almost forgot how much that hurt, water gathering at his eyes. He rubbed the spot sullenly, inspecting his hand for blood. There was a little.  
真嗣几乎忘记了那有多痛，泪水在眼眶中打转。他郁闷地揉了揉那个地方，检查手上是否有血。有一点。

"Sei kein Baby!" Asuka snapped, stomping a foot. At his befuddled look, she squeezed her eyes shut before saying, "you're a boy – ja?"  
“别像个小孩子！”明日香厉声说道，跺了跺脚。看到他困惑的表情，她闭上眼睛，然后说：“你是男孩，对吧？”

Shinji thought about picking up a handful of rocks and throwing them at her. But... she was a girl. Boys weren't supposed to hurt girls.  
真嗣想着抓起一把石头朝她扔过去。但……她是女孩。男孩不应该伤害女孩。

"Du kriegst mich nicht!" she sang, turning on her heels into the garden.  
“你抓不到我！”她唱着，转身跑进了花园。

He ran after her, struggling to keep pace as she wove through the garden, disregarding the paths entirely. For a moment, he lost sight of her and panic bolted his heart, until he burst through one of the bushes and tumbled into a clearing. Groaning as he stood up in a cloud of dust, he found Asuka standing in front of the ugly tree they had first met at. Brushing his shirt down, he stumbled closer. A question started to form before the girl dashed forward, scrambling up the tree trunk.  
他追在她后面，努力跟上她穿梭在花园中、完全不顾路径的步伐。有那么一会儿，他看不见她，恐慌让他的心跳加速，直到他冲破一丛灌木，跌进一片空地。他一边呻吟着站起来，一边拍打着身上的尘土，发现明日香正站在他们初次相遇的那棵丑树前。他整理着衬衫，踉跄地走近。一个问题刚要出口，女孩就冲向前，手脚并用爬上了树干。

"Asuka!" he cried, worry and excitement lacing his limbs as she wedged her hands into the knots to pull herself up. She was really close to the– the not-apples.  
“明日香！”他喊道，担忧和兴奋交织在他的四肢中，她正将手插入树结中，用力向上攀爬。她真的离那些——不是苹果的果实——很近了。

"What are those?" he asked.  
“那是什么？”他问道。

She sent him a scowl, eye lids fluttering as though she were trying to figure out what he had said. She reached for the next branch. "Olives dummko–" she missed and slipped, hitting the ground with a loud _thud_ and a puff of dust.  
她瞪了他一眼，眼皮轻颤，仿佛在努力理解他的话。她伸手去抓下一根树枝。“橄榄，傻瓜——”她没抓稳，滑了下来，重重地摔在地上，扬起一片尘土。

Shinji started, only to stop halfway. The branches weren't very high, at least not like most of the other trees. What should he do? She rolled over with a pout that made him think of turning tail to find Teacher, but, if she was hurt...  
真嗣一惊，中途停了下来。树枝并不高，至少不像其他大多数树那样。他该怎么办？她翻了个身，噘嘴的样子让他想转身去找老师，但如果她受伤了……

"Stupid Shinji!" she yelled, rubbing her arm and seemingly on the brink of tears. "Du hättest mich auffangen sollen!"  
"笨蛋真嗣！" 她喊道，揉着胳膊，眼看着就要哭出来。"你应该接住我的！"

He stiffened. "B-but I–" 他僵住了。"但-但是我——"

She let loose a growl. "You're annoying," she said with a frown, opening her hand to reveal a few of the greenish olives in her palm, now a little squished. He eyed them suspiciously as the girl split one in half, digging a black pebble out and tossing it away before eating the mangled skin. It made his mouth water and he inched closer.  
她发出一声低吼。"你真烦人，"她皱着眉说，摊开手掌，露出几颗被压扁的绿色橄榄。他怀疑地盯着它们，只见女孩将其中一颗掰成两半，挖出里面的黑色小石子扔掉，然后吃掉了那被压烂的果肉。这让他不禁咽了咽口水，慢慢靠近了些。

When she noticed, she closed her hand and turned to hide them. "Mine."  
她注意到后，立刻握紧手，转身藏起它们。“我的。”

Shinji grimaced, but by the look on her face, he wouldn't be convincing the girl to share anytime soon. He looked to the tree and the nearby brush, spotting exactly what he needed. He snatched a long stick from the ground and, tongue pinched between his lips, reached up on his tippy toes to swing the branch at the hanging olives. Three more times he repeated the process, jumping on the third strike and causing a whole bundle to fall free. The bottom ones were dirtied, but the ones on the top looked tasty enough and he only had to rub them on his shirt a little.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，但从她的表情来看，要说服她分享似乎不太可能。他环顾四周，目光落在那棵树和附近的灌木丛上，正好找到了他需要的东西。他迅速从地上抓起一根长棍，嘴唇间夹着舌头，踮起脚尖，挥动树枝去打那些悬挂的橄榄。他又重复了三次，第三次跳起来，使得一大串橄榄掉落。底下的几个沾了泥土，但上面的看起来足够美味，他只需在衬衫上稍微擦一擦。

Asuka looked down at her handful of olives and then back to his arguably larger catch.  
明日香低头看了看自己手里的一把橄榄，又看了看他明显更多的收获。

She scooted over to where he crouched, shooting him a threatening glare when he opened his mouth. He picked one that was a deep red, doing like Asuka had done and ripping out the hard black thing inside. Before he could put it in his mouth, Asuka gave him a serious look and leaned close enough for her hair to try and stick to his sweaty face. "Zuerst schmeckts eklig. Also nicht ausspucken," she said.  
她挪到他蹲着的地方，当他张嘴时，她投去一个威胁的眼神。他挑了一个深红色的橄榄，模仿着明日香的做法，把里面硬硬的黑核扯了出来。还没等他把橄榄放进嘴里，明日香严肃地看了他一眼，凑得近到她的头发都试图粘在他汗湿的脸上。“一开始味道很恶心。别吐出来。”她说。

He made a questioning grunt and Asuka poked her cheek, face pinching. "Taste bad – chew."  
他发出一个疑问的咕哝声，明日香戳了戳自己的脸颊，表情扭曲。“味道不好——嚼一嚼。”

It tasted bad? He couldn't imagine why she would be eating them if that was the case. Either way he was far too curious to not do it now. So, he tossed the olive in his mouth and chomped.  
味道不好吗？他想不通如果真是这样，她为什么还要吃它们。无论如何，他现在太好奇了，不可能不尝试。于是，他把橄榄扔进嘴里，咬了一口。

His tongue shrank in on itself. A cheek burning flavor, worse than the black coffee he'd once snuck a sip of, turning rancid and shriveling his mouth to ash. It was so dry he might as well have been eating a fistful of grass! He wanted to spit it out, but a hand clamped over his mouth, planted there by Asuka.  
他的舌头不由自主地缩了回去。一种灼烧脸颊的味道，比他曾偷偷尝过的黑咖啡还要糟糕，变得酸败并让他的口腔干枯如灰。干涩得仿佛在嚼一把草！他想吐出来，但明日香的手紧紧捂住了他的嘴，牢牢地按在那里。

"Chew," she commanded. “嚼，”她命令道。

Face puckering, tears welled at the edges of his eyes – and not because he was sad, for once. A full minute went by as he chewed and the harsh, biting taste started to fade. His mouth felt slick and the throat tingling bitterness still wouldn't leave, yet the olive began to taste well... not quite so bitter. It nearly tasted sweet, like a hint of it as he swallowed, a sour touch disappearing with the remnants of olive. Asuka removed her hand as he did so and he smarted from the lingering aftertaste that hung about his mouth, clinging to the inside of his teeth. Like when his breath smelled really bad in the morning before he brushed.  
他皱起脸，泪水在眼角涌出——这次并非因为悲伤。整整一分钟过去，他咀嚼着，那股刺鼻的味道开始消退。口腔变得湿润，喉咙里残留的苦涩依旧不散，然而那颗橄榄的味道开始变得……没那么苦了。几乎带点甜味，随着吞咽，那股酸涩感也随之消失。明日香在他吞下后松开了手，他仍因口中残留的余味而感到刺痛，那味道黏附在牙齿内侧，就像早晨刷牙前口气难闻时的感觉。

Asuka smirked as he eyed another of the olives, popping one nonchalantly in her mouth.  
明日香轻蔑地笑了笑，目光又盯上了另一颗橄榄，漫不经心地丢进嘴里。

They sat together and ate from the olive tree, fingers and shirts smeared and slick with their oils, mouths stained blue, until it was time for Shinji to return to his lessons.  
他们坐在一起，从橄榄树上摘食，手指和衬衫都沾满了油渍，嘴唇染成了蓝色，直到真嗣该回去上课的时候。

The days proceeded more or less so.  
日子就这样一天天过去。

Sometimes Asuka would come and find him, either waiting at the door to his house or throwing pebbles at his bedroom window in the afternoon. Play usually consisted of king of the hill – and Asuka always won. Victorious, she would claim he should be better at wrestling because he was a boy. He couldn't disagree. Other times they would see who could climb the olive tree the fastest. She always won that too.  
有时明日香会来找他，要么在他家门口等着，要么下午朝他卧室的窗户扔小石子。玩耍通常是玩“山丘之王”——而明日香总是赢。胜利后，她会说他应该更擅长摔跤，因为他是个男孩。他无法反驳。其他时候，他们会比赛谁爬橄榄树最快。她也总是赢。

Eventually, Asuka stopped waiting on him and invited herself into their house whenever she pleased, much to Teacher's displeasure. After a talk with her father – the man he'd met his first day – Asuka came in only when Shinji was allowed to play. Some days she wasn't there at all and others she was only outside for a few minutes. But as the months passed by, he grew used to the exotically haired girl and her mysterious house and the big garden, at times forgetting about his father far away.  
最终，明日香不再等他，而是随心所欲地闯进他们家，这让老师很不高兴。在与她的父亲——他第一天见到的那个男人——谈过之后，明日香只在真嗣被允许玩耍时才进来。有些日子她根本不在，而其他时候她只在门外待几分钟。但随着时间的流逝，他逐渐习惯了这位有着异国情调发色的女孩、她神秘的房子和那个大花园，有时甚至忘记了远在他乡的父亲。

He never saw the black snake again either, wondering if he'd merely been imagining it the whole time.  
他也再没见过那条黑蛇，不知道自己是否从头到尾都只是幻觉。

---

The dirt was cool between his fingers, a soft golden yellow mingling with the stubborn chunks of brown earth that hid it. Skin stained up to his elbows, Shinji continued to dig, using his fingers to shovel the now loose dirt up into a mound that nearly reached his chest. It needed to be bigger.  
泥土在他指间透着凉意，柔软的金黄与顽固的棕色土块交织，隐藏其中。手臂沾满泥土，伸至肘部，真嗣继续挖掘，用手指将松散的泥土堆成一座几乎触及胸口的小丘。它需要更大些。

He gathered yet another armful atop the mound, sand collecting around his filthy knees. The thorn bushes cracked 'round the side of the olive tree and Shinji tensed, waiting for a flash of black scales by the roots. Instead, Asuka stepped out from behind the trunk, wearing a dark blue dress with a big red bow around her stomach. He quirked his face at that, but didn't ask about it. Talking was too hard sometimes since they didn't speak the same.  
他又抱起一捧泥土堆在丘上，沙粒在肮脏的膝盖周围聚集。刺丛在橄榄树旁噼啪作响，真嗣紧张起来，等待着树根旁闪现黑色鳞片的身影。然而，明日香从树干后走出，身着深蓝色连衣裙，腰间系着大大的红色蝴蝶结。他对此挑了挑眉，但没有询问。有时交谈太过困难，因为他们语言不通。

When she saw him, she just stayed by the tree's big roots, making him feel, like always, very small with those staring eyes. He glanced down at himself – yellow shirt marred with grass stains and smudges of dirt, nails and fingers utterly caked with it. His gray shorts with the big pockets he liked fared no better. Asuka, on the other hand, was not at all dirty. Her long hair was neat and brushed and tied back in twin tails.  
当她看到他时，只是站在树根旁，那双凝视的眼睛让他一如既往地感到自己渺小。他低头看了看自己——黄色衬衫上沾满了草渍和泥土污迹，指甲和手指完全被泥土覆盖。他喜欢的灰色短裤，那条有大口袋的短裤，情况也好不到哪儿去。而明日香则一点儿也不脏。她的长发整齐地梳理，扎成双马尾。

"Why you here?" she asked. At least, that's what he assumed she had asked, pronouncing the words in that weird drawn-out way. He shrugged and gestured with splayed hands to his crumbling dirt castle.  
"你为什么在这里？" 她问道。至少，他猜她问的是这个，用那种奇怪的拖长音调发音。他耸了耸肩，摊开双手指向他那摇摇欲坠的泥土城堡。

Asuka bit her lower lip as she stood straight, arms tight to her sides. She looked to the trees and foliage around them, throwing her hands out and spinning. She set her bright blue eyes on him expectantly. He cast his gaze about, mouth making a big O. His focus fell to his half-finished mountain, fingers sinking into the dirt. "I don't know."  
明日香紧咬着下唇，站得笔直，双臂紧贴身体两侧。她环顾四周的树木和植被，双手一挥，转了个圈。她那双明亮的蓝眼睛期待地盯着他。他四处张望，嘴巴张成了一个大 O 形。他的目光落在了他那半成品的山上，手指陷进了泥土里。"我不知道。"

"What you mean?" she asked in muddled Japanese, making him bite back a snicker. Nostrils flaring, her hands squeezed into fists. "Bist du dumm?"  
"你什么意思？" 她用蹩脚的日语问道，让他差点笑出声来。她鼻孔张开，双手紧握成拳。"你是不是傻？"

His mirth vanished. He hadn't learned what most of her words meant and she always talked slower when speaking his. But by her tone it probably wasn't something nice that she'd said.  
他的笑容消失了。他还没弄懂她大部分话的意思，而且她用他的语言说话时总是说得更慢。但从她的语气来看，她说的可能不是什么好话。

"I have to live here. My dad says so," he answered, pushing a hand through the dirt and collapsing the upper half of the mound. The chunks spilled over into the trenches he'd dug, half covering the tiny roots that had been exposed in his excavations. Asuka didn't say anything and Shinji looked at the mess of his work. The idea he'd had when he started was shattered. He couldn't even remember what it was supposed to be anymore. He could try rebuilding it by himself, but the more he stared at it, the more hopeless the task seemed.  
“我必须住在这里。我爸爸这么说的，”他回答道，用手拨弄着泥土，将土堆的上半部分弄塌。土块倾泻进他挖的沟渠里，半掩埋了他在挖掘中暴露出来的细小根系。明日香没有说话，真嗣看着自己弄得一团糟的作品。他开始时的想法已经破碎了。他甚至记不清原本打算做什么了。他可以尝试自己重建，但越是盯着看，这项任务就越显得无望。

Asuka's shoes scuffed across the ground as she fell to her knees on the other side of the mound. Sitting up, she twisted her bow so that it was on her back instead. "Like this," she said, bending and scooping some of the dirt out of the trenches. He watched as her hands padded the dirt ever higher, shifting and swiping at it to make a smooth surface.  
明日香的双脚在地上蹭着，她跪在了土堆的另一边。坐起来后，她扭动身体，把弓背到了背上。“像这样，”她说着，弯腰从沟渠里铲出一些泥土。他看着她的双手将泥土堆得越来越高，不断移动和扫拂，使之形成一个平滑的表面。

He started grabbing handfuls of dirt too and they quietly worked on the mound, staining their clothes and smearing their arms and faces with streaks of black. They made it perfect, all four sides inclining to a sharp point like the pyramids he'd seen in Teacher's books.  
他也开始抓起大把的泥土，两人静静地堆砌着土堆，衣服上沾满了污渍，手臂和脸上都抹上了黑色的痕迹。他们把它堆得完美无缺，四个侧面都向着一个尖锐的顶点倾斜，就像他在老师的书上看到的金字塔一样。

Asuka brushed her hands off on the ends of her dress, rising to a crouch with her knees together, hands resting on them as she appraised their efforts.  
明日香在裙摆上拍了拍手，蹲起身来，双膝并拢，双手搭在膝盖上，审视着他们的成果。

The birds and bugs sounded their calls in the late afternoon, and the sky was fading to a deep blue, streaks of white left behind by whining planes. In the days that followed, one way or another, they would always find themselves in the secret spot by the olive tree, eating fruit that no one else ate and building their own worlds together.  
午后时分，鸟儿和昆虫们鸣叫着，天空渐渐变成深蓝色，飞机的哀鸣留下了白色的尾迹。接下来的日子里，无论怎样，他们总会找到橄榄树下的秘密角落，吃着别人不吃的水果，一起构建自己的世界。

Shinji shivered as another soft, chilling wind swept through the trees and tickled his neck and arms. The sun was still bright and burning, yet the gardens welcomed a low breeze. He threw another rock, this time managing to skip it three times across the water, though it missed the stone statue by a wide arc. Pinching his tongue between his lips, he prepared another rock.  
一阵轻柔而冰冷的微风掠过树梢，拂过真嗣的脖颈和手臂，让他不禁打了个寒颤。阳光依旧灿烂炙热，但花园里却迎来了一阵凉爽的微风。他扔出另一块石头，这次成功地让它在水面上跳跃了三次，尽管偏离了石像一大段距离。他紧抿着舌头，准备再扔一块石头。

There was shouting and the toss went wide – again. Shinji turned to the source, sighting the taller spires of the mansion over the cherry trees. Answered by silence as he searched, he started to slink towards the back patio and did his utmost to be stealthy. It had been made law his first day that he wasn't allowed to leave the garden – yes, Teacher had made that very clear. So as long as he stayed within the border, there was no way he could get in trouble.  
一阵喧闹声传来，投掷再次偏出——又一次。真嗣转向声源，透过樱花树看到了宅邸更高的塔楼。他四处搜寻，回应他的却是寂静无声，于是他开始悄悄地向后面的露台移动，竭尽全力保持隐秘。第一天就被明令禁止离开花园——是的，老师说得非常清楚。因此，只要他留在花园的边界内，就不可能惹上麻烦。

But Asuka hadn't been out to the gardens for several days now, maybe she would be just outside the mansion. He reached the edge of the treeline to see the house in full, just as a familiar girl burst out of an open back door.  
但明日香已经好几天没来花园了，也许她就在宅邸外面。他走到树线的边缘，正好看到一个熟悉的女孩从敞开的后门冲了出来。

"I don't want another stupid doll!" she cried.  
"我不要另一个愚蠢的娃娃！" 她哭喊道。

Someone unseen called after her, stopping Shinji from doing the same. She disappeared into the dizzying array of flowers and tall ferns. He knew that side of the garden – that was where the rose bushes were. Frowning, Shinji entered the comparatively sparse part of the terraced plants, flanked by marble pillars and pointy Cypruses. He walked carefully, keeping a sharp eye out for Asuka. He found her in a wide ring of sandstone bordered by crimson roses, at the center of which was a fountain with a square pool. She had her back to him, staring into the bubbling waters. Inching forward, he approached her as one might approach a lion.  
一个看不见的人在她身后喊了一声，阻止了真嗣跟上去。她消失在令人眼花缭乱的花丛和高大的蕨类植物中。他知道花园的那一边——那里是玫瑰丛所在的地方。真嗣皱着眉头，走进了相对稀疏的梯田植物区，两侧是白色大理石柱和尖尖的柏树。他小心翼翼地走着，时刻警惕着寻找明日香。他在一圈由红玫瑰环绕的砂岩边找到了她，中央是一个方形水池的喷泉。她背对着他，凝视着冒泡的水面。他蹑手蹑脚地靠近，就像接近一头狮子一样。

"A-Asuka?" "A-明日香？"

Her hair whipped as she spun to meet him. "What do _you_ want?"  
她猛地转身，头发随之飘动。"你想干什么？"

He flinched. "I, uh... a-are you... okay?" he asked in a small voice. Her expression fell and she showed him her back, while his eyes met the stones at his feet. The thought of leaving twitched his hands, though he couldn't get his legs to move.  
他退缩了。“我，呃... 你... 还好吗？”他小声问道。她的表情变得沮丧，转身背对着他，而他的目光则落在脚下的石头上。离开的念头让他的手微微颤抖，尽管他的腿却动弹不得。

"Asuka?" He reached out to touch her. As if sensing his closeness, she tensed.  
“明日香？”他伸出手去触碰她。仿佛感受到了他的接近，她紧张起来。

"No!" she screamed, turning and shoving him.  
“不！”她尖叫着，转身推开了他。

Shinji tripped, rosebush thorns ripping down his right arm as he fell. He hissed, struggling to sit up in the dirt as deep red streaks snaked down to his elbow, arm throbbing with fire.  
真嗣绊了一跤，跌倒时玫瑰丛的刺划破了他的右臂。他倒吸一口凉气，挣扎着在泥土中坐起身，深红色的血痕蜿蜒至肘部，手臂如火灼般疼痛。

Asuka's eyes went wide. 明日香瞪大了眼睛。

"Go away!" she shouted, dashing beyond the borders of the garden and leaving Shinji alone, his blood seeping into the earth around a foreign purple flower.  
“走开！”她大喊着，冲出了花园的边界，留下真嗣独自一人，他的血渗入异域紫花周围的土壤中。

###  Chapter 3: Amaranthus 苋菜
Shinji's fifth birthday came and went, and in another few months he would be six. Nothing special. The only reason he'd known the day had come around at all was because Teacher made rice balls with pickled plum filling, muttering a simple "congratulations". The rolls were much sweeter than the olives from the tree and he imagined Asuka might have liked that.  
真嗣的五岁生日来了又去，再过几个月他就满六岁了。没什么特别的。他之所以知道这一天已经到来，唯一的原因是老师做了梅子馅的饭团，嘴里咕哝着简单的“恭喜”。这些饭团比橄榄树上的橄榄甜多了，他想象着明日香可能会喜欢。

For a while, he had wandered the gardens alone, excitement blossoming in him as a flare of red caught his eye, only to wilt as he realized it was just a flower or some other plant. After pushing him into the rosebush, she'd disappeared from the world, making him wonder if he'd imagined her like the black snake.  
有一段时间，他独自在花园里徘徊，兴奋之情在他心中绽放，因为一抹红色吸引了他的目光，但当他意识到那只是一朵花或其他植物时，兴奋便枯萎了。自从她把他推到玫瑰丛中后，她就从这个世界消失了，让他怀疑自己是否像那条黑蛇一样想象了她。

Shinji would look longingly to the mansion he was not allowed near, thinking he might catch a glimpse of her in the windows and hoping she hadn't been sent to some far away place too. Eventually, he stopped exploring the garden and stayed near his small house, with his father's black cased SDAT there to fill his days. Old Japanese pop danced in the trees and pulsed through the clouds, while he contemplated the thin white line that ran down his wrist and to his elbow.  
真嗣会渴望地望向那座他不被允许靠近的宅邸，心想也许能在窗户里瞥见她，并希望她没有被送到某个遥远的地方。最终，他停止了探索花园，留在了自己的小屋附近，那里有父亲的黑匣子 SDAT 陪伴他度过每一天。老式日本流行音乐在树间舞动，穿过云层，而他则凝视着从手腕延伸到肘部的细白线。

On a particularly muggy day, he'd been sitting on the front porch waiting for the time to ebb away when the garden called to him. The sun had been burning the white rocks at his feet and the beech tree leaves shimmered with light. SDAT in hand, he started walking along a familiar path, painted with jagged patchworks of shade, until he came to the gray-green olive tree. He stood in the small clearing around it, sun beating against him and throwing up waves of heat that made him squint. The chirping screams of the cicadas grew louder.  
在一个特别闷热的日子里，他坐在前廊上，等待时间慢慢流逝，这时花园在呼唤他。阳光炙烤着他脚下的白石，山毛榉树的叶子在光中闪烁。手持 SDAT，他沿着一条熟悉的小径走去，这条小径被参差不齐的阴影斑块点缀着，直到他来到那棵灰绿色的橄榄树前。他站在围绕着树的小空地上，阳光猛烈地打在他身上，掀起阵阵热浪，让他眯起了眼睛。蝉鸣的尖叫声越来越响。

That was when he saw her.  
就在那时，他看到了她。

She'd gotten a little taller since last time, leaning against the trunk and looking at the ground. Thinking it must have been some sort of trick of the sun, he pulled the buds from his ears, blinking. When she realized he was there, surprise touched her expression, but was quickly swept away under a sullen mask. He fidgeted and considered leaving, gripping his SDAT tight. Her blue eyes held him in place, until she turned to face him fully and marched forward.  
自从上次见面以来，她似乎长高了一些，靠在树干上，低头看着地面。他以为这一定是阳光造成的某种幻觉，于是从耳朵里取出耳机，眨了眨眼。当她意识到他在那里时，惊讶掠过她的脸庞，但很快就被阴沉的面具掩盖了。他局促不安，考虑着离开，紧紧握住他的 SDAT。她的蓝眼睛让他无法动弹，直到她完全转过身来，大步向前走去。

All he could do was stand there, trembling while his right arm throbbed.  
他只能站在那里，颤抖着，右臂阵阵作痛。

Then, she flicked him in the nose. "Tag – you're it!"  
接着，她在他鼻子上轻弹了一下。“抓到你了——你现在是‘它’了！”

He jumped and the girl ran back to the tree, spinning around to face him with a challenging smirk – as if it hadn't been months since she'd been away. Like they'd been with each other all along. His mouth fell open, closing as determination took hold and set him off after her.  
他一跃而起，女孩跑回树旁，转身面对他，带着挑衅的微笑——仿佛她离开不过几天，而不是几个月。就像他们一直在一起似的。他张开的嘴又合上了，决心驱使他追了上去。

All at once the days weren't so lonely anymore.  
突然间，日子不再那么孤单了。

They climbed, argued over dirt mounds, and inevitably started throwing mud clods at one another. Which was innocent enough unless he got it in her hair. She'd slap him and scratch him, shrieking threats in German he had yet to learn. Then he'd retreat to the pond behind his house to nurse his wounds, where she would eventually find him, guarded but no less angry. She never apologized and he never demanded it of her, and their close proximity would quickly devolve into a scuffle to push one another in the water with the fish. He had succeeded only once, and caught a rock in the face immediately after.  
他们爬上爬下，争论着土堆，最终不可避免地开始互相扔泥块。这本是无伤大雅的，除非他弄脏了她的头发。她会扇他耳光，抓他，用他尚未学会的德语尖叫着威胁。然后他会退到自家房子后面的池塘边疗伤，她最终会找到他，虽然戒备但依旧愤怒。她从不道歉，他也从未要求过，他们的近距离很快就会演变成一场推搡，试图把对方推进水里和鱼儿作伴。他只成功过一次，紧接着就被一块石头砸中了脸。

They didn't fight so much after that, and Asuka insisted putting bandaids on the wound herself, berating him for not dodging.  
从那以后，他们就不怎么打架了，而明日香坚持要亲自给他的伤口贴上创可贴，责备他没有躲闪。

Speaking German gradually became easier. But every time he thought he had a good idea of how to say things, they learned something new that completely changed how he was supposed to say them. Asuka started speaking more and more Japanese during his stay on the Langley estate, which was nice. At least his words were _already_ easy, unlike hers, which made his throat hurt sometimes.  
说德语渐渐变得容易起来。但每当他觉得自己已经掌握了如何表达时，他们又会学到一些新东西，彻底改变他原本应该怎么说。在 Langley 庄园逗留期间，明日香开始说越来越多的日语，这很好。至少他的语言已经很流畅了，不像她的，有时会让他的喉咙感到疼痛。

Ever since he'd found her again, they'd rarely spent a day apart. Well – except today. Perhaps she was locked away in her castle again? Shinji couldn't be sure if that was actually the case, as he never knew what went on behind those big oak doors. Come to think of it, he had never seen much of Herr Langley since arriving either.  
自从他再次找到她以来，他们很少有一天分开过。嗯——除了今天。也许她又把自己关在城堡里了？真嗣不能确定这是否属实，因为他从来不知道那些巨大的橡木门背后发生了什么。话说回来，自从他来到这里，也从未见过 Langley 先生多少次。

Venturing into the rose garden, it was then he realized there was a side to the house he'd neglected to explore. Around the bend, guided by white flowered trellises, were cordoned off boxes packed with dark soil, making neat rows in the shadow of their mansion.  
走进玫瑰园，他这才意识到房子还有一面他未曾探索过。转过弯，在白色花架的引导下，一排排整齐的箱子装满了深色的土壤，在他们的庄园的阴影下形成了一片区域。

Herr Langley was bent over one of these, the sleeves of his white shirt rolled up to the elbows. A skinny sort of man with broad shoulders and a tired posture, graying hair cut short and neat. Asuka was beside him wearing that blue dress again, diamond earrings glittering in the sunlight.  
兰格利先生正弯腰对着其中一台机器，白色衬衫的袖子卷到了肘部。他是个瘦削的男人，肩膀宽阔，姿态疲惫，灰白的头发剪得短而整齐。明日香站在他旁边，又穿上了那件蓝色连衣裙，钻石耳环在阳光下闪闪发光。

For Shinji's part, shorts and a dirty sleeveless shirt were pretty much it.  
至于真嗣，他只穿了条短裤和一件脏兮兮的无袖衬衫。

Langley caught sight of him, a grin attempting to tug at his mouth, but coming out as a displeased grimace. With a nod, he signaled Shinji over and the boy approached, nervously. Asuka was glaring at him. He tried for a smile and was studiously ignored.  
兰格利注意到他，嘴角试图扯出一个笑容，却变成了不悦的皱眉。他点头示意真嗣过去，男孩紧张地走近。明日香正瞪着他。他试图露出微笑，却被刻意忽视了。

"Here, look," Langley said, black smudged fingers carving out narrow lines in the dark earth. He instructed each of them to hold out their hands.  
"看这里，" 兰利说道，沾满黑色污迹的手指在黑土中划出狭窄的线条。他指导每个人都伸出双手。

"We're going to plant some radishes," he said, pouring seeds into their palms. Then they sprinkled them into the hand-carved fissures, soon spreading the dirt back over them and matting it gently. He let Asuka water the dirt and she tossed some at Shinji, smiling impishly when he frowned and sticking her tongue out.  
"我们要种些萝卜，" 他说着，将种子倒入他们的手掌中。然后他们将种子撒入手工挖出的裂缝中，很快又将泥土覆盖回去，轻轻压实。他让明日香给泥土浇水，她朝真嗣扔了一些，当他皱眉时，她调皮地笑了，还吐了吐舌头。

"What are you doing?" Langley demanded, taking it back. "Don't be so careless."  
"你在做什么？" 兰利质问道，把水壶夺了回来。"别这么粗心大意。"

Asuka's expression was snatched away with it and she put her hands behind her back. "Sorry, papa," she mumbled, though he didn't seem to have heard her. Flecks of brown fell as he brushed his hands off on his black pants, motioning them to follow. Shinji stayed a few paces behind, watching as Asuka's body went rigid every moment he strayed too close.  
明日香的表情也随之消失，她将双手背在身后。“对不起，爸爸，”她咕哝着，尽管他似乎没有听到。他拍了拍手上的棕色斑点，示意他们跟上。真嗣落后几步，看着每当他靠得太近时，明日香的身体就会变得僵硬。

All about there were other vegetables and plants he didn't have names for, some with bushy heads or thick vines. Shinji didn't have time to ponder them as Langley brought them back into the rose garden, naming each flower and where it came from instead. _Rosa_, white pink and mulberry shades from North Africa. _Gallicanae_, crimson roses from western Asia and Europe. _Hesperrhodos_, a yellow flower from North America – his favorite.  
周围还有许多他不认识的蔬菜和植物，有的长着浓密的头，有的则是粗壮的藤蔓。真嗣没时间细想这些，因为兰格利带他们回到了玫瑰园，逐一介绍每种花的名字和产地。北非的罗莎，白色、粉色和桑葚色的玫瑰。加利卡纳，来自西亚和欧洲的深红色玫瑰。赫斯佩罗多，来自北美的黄色花朵——他最喜欢的。

Then, just beyond the roses were these bunches of tiny pink buds, some darkening to a soft purple. Asuka gasped when she saw them, gliding her fingers through their many petals. That made Herr Langley chuckle.  
然后，就在玫瑰花丛之外，有一簇簇小小的粉色花蕾，有些逐渐变成柔和的紫色。明日香看到它们时惊呼一声，用手指轻轻滑过它们众多的花瓣。这让兰格利先生轻声笑了起来。

"These are Lilacs," he said, plucking one and fitting it into Asuka's hair by an ear. "They were your mother's favorite."  
"这些是丁香花，" 他说着，摘下一朵插在明日香耳边的头发里。"它们是你母亲最喜欢的。"

Shinji wondered what _his_ mother's favorite flowers had been. Maybe the cherry blossoms back home?  
真嗣想知道他母亲最喜欢的花是什么。也许是家乡的樱花？

_Home_. That place wasn't home anymore. He couldn't even imagine it – what the walls looked like, how it had smelled. All he managed to picture was broken glass and pain. Besides, she wasn't here anymore and there weren't any cherry blossoms in Germany. None that he knew of.  
家。那个地方已经不再是家了。他甚至无法想象它的样子——墙壁是什么样的，气味如何。他所能想到的只有破碎的玻璃和痛苦。而且，她已经不在这里了，德国也没有樱花。至少他不知道有。

He wanted to go home.  
他想回家。

It spoke to him in a whisper then, that accent of reddish purple, flowers hanging from its stalks like moss. He stumbled as he walked to it, falling to his hands and knees. The stones scuffed his shins, but he could see under the rose bushes where a small, lone bundle of flowers struggled for light between them. This was the flower he'd fallen by when Asuka had pushed him, his blood long since absorbed into the soil and washed away by the rains.  
那声音以低语的方式向他诉说，带着紫红色的口音，花朵如苔藓般悬挂在枝头。他踉跄着走向它，双膝跪地。石块刮伤了他的小腿，但他能看到玫瑰丛下，一束孤独的小花在它们之间挣扎着寻找阳光。这正是被明日香推倒时他身边的那朵花，他的血早已被土壤吸收，又被雨水冲刷干净。

Footsteps scratched against the stone as Langley knelt behind him. Asuka peered over Shinji's shoulder, touching the lilac so it stayed in her hair.  
兰利跪在他身后，脚步在石板上摩擦作响。明日香从真嗣的肩头望去，轻触那朵紫丁香，让它留在她的发间。

"Amaranthus," Langley said, brow knitting. "I'm not sure what it's doing in the rose garden..."  
"苋菜，" 兰利皱起眉头说，"我不确定它怎么会在玫瑰园里……"

Asuka touched Shinji to steady herself, trying to catch a whiff of it. "It's pretty," she said, nose scrunching. He tried to smell it too, but found only the honey-sweet scent of the roses.  
明日香扶着真嗣稳住自己，试图闻一闻它的味道。"很漂亮，"她说着，鼻子皱了起来。他也试着闻了闻，但只闻到了玫瑰的蜜甜香气。

Langley nodded. "The color never fades, even when the flower dies. Love-Lies-Bleeding they call it in America." his calloused fingers reached out, letting the fluffy tendrils slide over his fingers. It was slow and gentle, a parting touch as the tip of it slipped free, swaying from his grasp. His face fell, eyes becoming glassy as the light seeped out of them. In a moment, Shinji saw his father kneeling there instead.  
兰利点点头。"这种花的颜色永不褪色，即使花朵凋谢。在美国，人们称之为'断情花'。" 他粗糙的手指伸出去，让柔软的卷须滑过指间。动作缓慢而温柔，仿佛是告别的一触，末梢从他手中滑落，轻轻摇曳。他的脸沉了下来，眼中光芒渐逝。那一刻，真嗣仿佛看到了他的父亲跪在那里。

Langley stood, turning to walk back to the castle without a word. Perplexed, panicked, Asuka struggled to catch up, tugging onto his pants leg.  
兰利站着，一言不发地转身走回城堡。困惑又慌乱的明日香挣扎着追上去，拽住了他的裤腿。

"I want to see more flowers papa," she said, practically demanding.  
“爸爸，我想看更多的花，”她几乎是要求道。

He sighed, tugging free. "No. Not today."  
他叹了口气，挣脱开来。“不行，今天不行。”

Slipping from her grasp, he left them standing by the fountain. Asuka stared long after he disappeared into the house. Shinji hauled himself up, trading glances between the Amaranthus and Asuka. Why did they give such a pretty plant such a sad name?  
他从她手中滑脱，留下他们在喷泉旁伫立。明日香久久凝视着他消失在屋内的身影。真嗣费力地站起身，目光在苋菜和明日香之间来回交换。为何他们会给如此美丽的植物起一个悲伤的名字？

"Your dad's nice," he said.  
“你爸爸人很好，”他说。

"Be quiet," Asuka snipped. "This is your fault anyway."  
“闭嘴，”明日香厉声道，“反正这都是你的错。”

She tugged something from a pigtail and started off. He moved to follow, her name on the tip of his tongue, when something feathery crunched under foot, the lilac from her hair now stamped flat into the stone.  
她从发辫中拽出某物，随即动身离开。他正要跟上，她的名字已到嘴边，脚下却踩到了什么羽毛般的东西，她发间的丁香花此刻已被碾碎在石板上。

---

Shinji didn't know how he found her or what led him there, maybe because it was one of the few places he had come to make his own in the past year, a distant shelter away from Teacher and the castle. The old shed stuck out, sore and rotted at the edge of the garden. On the other side of which were sprawling dandelion fields, disrupted here and there by thin bundles of trees.  
真嗣不知道自己是怎么找到她的，也不清楚是什么引导他来到这里，或许是因为这是过去一年中他少数几个自己找到的避难所之一，远离老师和城堡的遥远庇护所。那间旧棚屋显得格外突兀，边缘破败腐朽。棚屋的另一侧是一片蔓延的蒲公英田，其间零星点缀着几丛稀疏的树木。

A big, golden brown dog, floppy ears and black nose, was attacking Asuka. Why was she laughing? He'd already started running to her as fast as his almost-six-year-old legs could manage, when he realized the dog was only licking her.  
一只硕大的金棕色狗狗，耷拉着耳朵和黑鼻子，正在攻击明日香。她为何在笑？他已经开始拼命向她跑去，尽管他那快满六岁的腿脚已经尽力了，这时他才意识到那只狗只是在舔她。

Asuka rolled onto her belly at the crunch of grass, smiling face swept away at the very sight of him. Was it really that bad, just looking at him? He hadn't meant for her dad to leave. How was it his fault anyway? It was because he'd found that weird flower, wasn't it?  
听到草丛的沙沙声，明日香翻身趴在地上，一见到他，笑容便瞬间消失。难道看他一眼就那么糟糕吗？他并没有想让她的爸爸离开。这又怎么能怪他呢？是因为他找到了那朵奇怪的花，不是吗？

He was always messing things up.  
他总是把事情搞砸。

Asuka sat up, her back to him, and dug her fingers behind the dog's ears, bowing her head to one side so he couldn't lick her face. Cicadas screamed, basking in a heat that swallowed up any cooling breezes there might've been. He should have left, he knew. He didn't have a mom or dad, or a dog and a nice house with a huge colorful garden. That was why Asuka didn't like him. They were different. _He_ was different. Even her dad got sad just being around him. It seemed to be the only thing Shinji was able to do.  
明日香坐起身，背对着他，手指在狗耳朵后面挠着，歪着头不让狗舔到她的脸。蝉鸣声嘶力竭，在吞噬了所有可能的凉风的酷热中沐浴。他本该离开的，他知道。他没有妈妈或爸爸，也没有狗和漂亮的房子以及五彩缤纷的大花园。这就是明日香不喜欢他的原因。他们不一样。他与众不同。甚至她的爸爸只是在他身边就会感到难过。似乎这是真嗣唯一能做的事。

Still, the waves of sunlight radiating across the fields of yellow kept his feet snug in the grass. The weeds snared his legs, pulling him down to their warmth.  
尽管如此，阳光洒满金黄田野的波纹仍让他的双脚在草丛中感到温暖。野草缠绕着他的双腿，将他拉向它们的温暖之中。

"I didn't know you had a dog," he said after a sudden rush of wind.  
"我之前不知道你有条狗，"他在一阵突如其来的风后说道。

"He's not my dog," she said, in place of yelling or scratching. She patted the pup's shoulders. "I call him _Panzer_."  
"他不是我的狗，"她没有大喊或抓挠，而是平静地说道。她轻拍着小狗的肩膀。"我叫他‘坦克’。"

The unfamiliar word rang through one ear and out the other. "What's that mean?"  
那个陌生的词汇从一只耳朵进，另一只耳朵出。“那是什么意思？”

Asuka stuttered, grasping for the word in Japanese. "Tank."  
明日香结巴着，试图用日语找到那个词。“坦克。”

"Tank," he repeated, nodding. It wasn't anything he would have named a dog, though sounded right all the same.  
“坦克，”他重复道，点头。虽然这并不是他会给狗起的名字，但听起来倒也合适。

It was a golden retriever, the neighbor's dog, often coming to visit the garden and the red haired girl that gave him treats and pets – or so she explained. Shinji approached the two, keeping a good foot between him and Tank. He'd never seen a dog this close before, or teeth that could probably rip his arm off.  
那是一只金毛寻回犬，邻居家的狗，常来花园拜访，还有那位红发女孩，她会给它零食和抚摸——她是这么解释的。真嗣走近一人一狗，与坦克保持了一步的距离。他从未如此近距离地看过一只狗，更别提那些可能撕裂他手臂的牙齿了。

"You can pet him," Asuka said, as if he needed her permission. He just–  
“你可以摸摸它，”明日香说道，仿佛他需要她的允许。他只是——

The girl grabbed his hand and shoved it into Tank's fur and Shinji froze – what else could you do when you were about to be torn to pieces? No such punishment came and instead the retriever began coating his entire face in saliva.  
女孩抓住他的手，猛地塞进坦克的毛里，真嗣僵住了——面对即将被撕成碎片的命运，你还能做什么呢？然而，惩罚并未降临，取而代之的是，那只金毛寻回犬开始用口水覆盖他的整张脸。

From then on, if they weren't by the olive tree, they were playing tag with Tank out in the fields. Asuka taught him how to fetch, using a five-year-old boy in place of sticks. No matter how fast Shinji would run, how expertly he'd juke, one way or another Tank would snag him by the shoulder of his shirt and dutifully drag him back to Asuka.  
从那时起，如果他们不在橄榄树旁，就会在田野里和坦克玩捉迷藏。明日香教他如何用捡东西，用一个五岁男孩代替树枝。无论真嗣跑得多快，躲得多巧妙，坦克总能设法抓住他衬衫的肩膀，然后忠实地把他拖回明日香身边。

Herr Langley never came out to check on the radishes again. Sometimes Gepard, the groundskeeper, would amble by and water them, while he and Asuka watched from the fountain near the roses.  
兰格利先生再也没有出来检查过萝卜。有时，园丁格帕德会慢悠悠地走过并给它们浇水，而他与明日香则从玫瑰花旁的喷泉处观看。

Weeks after, Shinji followed her voice through the trees, drawn by the unusual call in the gardens.  
几周后，真嗣循着她的声音穿过树林，被花园中不同寻常的呼唤所吸引。

"Taaank! Taaank!" "坦克！坦克！"

The dog always answered to this special name. Now, he was nowhere to be found and both of them had to wonder if the family living in the pastures beyond the hill had moved. They discovered as much was true later from Herr Langley.  
这条狗总是对这个特别的名字有反应。如今，它却不见踪影，两人不得不猜测，山那边牧场上居住的家庭是否已经搬走了。后来，他们从兰格先生那里得知，情况确实如此。

Asuka hadn't cried and had even asked her father for a dog of her own. Langley promised to do so if she was good.  
明日香没有哭，甚至还向她父亲要了一只自己的狗。兰格答应她，如果她表现好，就会给她一只。

For the next few weeks she towed Shinji out by the old shed and the dandelion fields, where they waited for Tank to appear over the hill. For a while Asuka wasn't quite so angry at him and taught him how to make circlets out of the flowers in the fields, demanding he make one for her each afternoon. She wore them when he finished and left them behind when night came crawling.  
接下来的几周里，她拉着真嗣来到旧棚屋和蒲公英田边，等待坦克从山丘上出现。有一段时间，明日香对他的怒气没那么大了，还教他如何用田里的花朵编花环，要求他每天下午为她编一个。她会在他完成时戴上，夜幕降临时又留下它们。

Her father kept promising and promising. "Soon, Asuka, you have to be patient," he said with a knit brow, shooing her out of the house. Eventually, when it began to settle in that Tank was gone for good, Asuka stopped looking to the hill, nor demanded he make flower circlets for her.  
她的父亲一再承诺。“很快，明日香，你要有耐心，”他皱着眉头说，把她赶出家门。最终，当她意识到坦克已经永远离开时，明日香不再望向山丘，也不再要求他为她编花环。

Herr Langley never did keep his promise.  
朗格先生从未兑现他的承诺。

Shinji's front teeth were missing.  
真嗣的前牙不见了。

He kind of thought he would lose them to Asuka at some point, but these had fallen out on their own. They'd been loose for the past week and he had assumed the problem would sort itself out eventually. It had, in a way. When he presented his fallen teeth to Teacher, on the brink of tears, the man had explained this was only natural.  
他有点觉得总有一天会因为明日香而失去它们，但这次是它们自己掉下来的。过去一周它们一直松动，他以为问题最终会自行解决。某种程度上，确实如此。当他含泪将掉落的牙齿交给老师时，老师解释说这只是自然现象。

Asuka had lost most of her teeth when she was four, before they met, the last one being the gap where her lower center tooth had been. Part of the reason she didn't grin so much now, prompting a stage of near-silent communication between them. Mostly because she kept making fun of him for the way his words whistled without his front teeth. She'd even made a game out of getting him to talk, usually by prodding him with sharp sticks or pretending she was sad just to get him to ask, "what's wrong?"  
明日香在四岁前就掉了大部分牙齿，那时他们还没相遇，最后一颗是她下排中间的牙齿留下的空隙。现在她不怎么咧嘴笑的部分原因，导致他们之间几乎无声的交流阶段。主要是因为她总是取笑他没了前牙说话时发出的口哨声。她甚至以此为乐，经常用尖棍子戳他或假装难过，只为让他问出：“怎么了？”

So he'd given her the cold shoulder one day and she'd kicked sand in his face, furious. Even now he thought he could still taste the grit in his mouth. As he entered the foyer through the back of Asuka's castle, some sort of sitting room, he hoped it didn't make his breath smell. There was also the niggling urge to go home and wash up. He'd been playing under the olive tree – digging for worms to be exact. They liked the soil near the roots, where it was rich and moist. The water from the fountains had washed most of it off by the time he was sent for, by Asuka no less.  
所以有一天他对她冷眼相待，她便愤怒地朝他脸上踢沙子。即便现在，他仍觉得自己能尝到嘴里的沙粒。当他从背后进入明日香的城堡，一个类似客厅的地方时，他希望这不会让他的口气变臭。还有种隐隐的冲动想回家洗个澡。他一直在橄榄树下玩耍——确切地说是在挖虫子。它们喜欢靠近树根的土壤，那里肥沃而湿润。当他被召唤时，喷泉的水已经冲掉了大部分泥土，而且还是明日香亲自来叫的。

"_Oma-ma_ wants to see you," she'd said, in that serious way that always made him a bit frightened of her. The word sounded familiar – _grandma_?  
“妈妈想见你，”她用那种总是让他有点害怕的严肃语气说道。这个词听起来很熟悉——奶奶？

The woman sat by the window, meeting him with a kind smile as she set her tea cup down. For an old person, she didn't have that many wrinkles, and he could tell she _must_ have been really, really old for her hair to be so white and her eyes to be so squinty.  
那位女士坐在窗边，放下茶杯，带着和蔼的微笑迎接他。对于一个老人来说，她皱纹不多，但他可以看出，她一定非常非常老了，因为她的头发如此雪白，眼睛也眯成了一条缝。

"So," she began, folding her hands in her lap. "You are the boy who's been keeping my little Asuka company."  
"那么，"她开口道，双手叠放在膝上。"你就是那个一直陪着我的小明日香的孩子。"

"_Oma_," the girl said it like a warning, having sat herself in the chair to his right and trying to look taller with her back straight. "He's not keeping me company... he's just some boy..." she muttered, throwing him a dismissive glance.  
"妈妈，"女孩用警告的语气说道，她坐在他右边的椅子上，挺直了背试图显得更高。"他不是在陪我……他只是个男孩……"她低声咕哝着，不屑地瞥了他一眼。"

Shinji flinched, trying to keep his chin up as all manners escaped him. He bowed, stopping halfway as he realized people didn't do that in Germany. So he stood stiff at attention and stuck out his hand, hoping she didn't notice how dirty it was.  
真嗣畏缩了一下，努力保持下巴抬起，所有的礼节都从他身上溜走了。他鞠了一躬，中途停下，意识到在德国人们不这么做。于是他僵硬地立正站好，伸出手，希望她没有注意到他的手有多脏。

"I'm Shinji Ikari, um," he paused, trying to remember the right words, "how old are you?"  
"我是碇真嗣，呃，"他停顿了一下，试图想起正确的词句，"你多大了？"

Asuka groaned, dragging a hand down her face. He'd messed up again, hadn't he?  
明日香叹了口气，用手抹了抹脸。他又搞砸了，不是吗？

_Oma's_ dark eyes narrowed as her smile lifted against her high cheek bones. If she noticed how filthy he was, she didn't seem to mind, taking his small fingers in her withered, liver-spotted hand.  
奥玛的深邃眼眸微微眯起，她的笑容在高高的颧骨上扬起。如果她注意到他有多脏，她似乎并不介意，用她那布满老年斑的枯瘦手指握住了他细小的手指。

"You may call me Ilka and I am seventy-nine, _junger_ Shinji," she leaned a little closer to whisper, "though most might consider it impolite to ask a lady how old she is."  
"你可以叫我伊尔卡，我今年七十九岁，年轻的真嗣。"她微微倾身，低声说道，"虽然大多数人可能会认为问女士的年龄是不礼貌的。"

It took him a moment to absorb what she'd said as she patted his hand and released her hold. He took a step back, nodding. "Sorry."  
他花了一会儿时间消化她的话，她拍了拍他的手，松开了握着的手。他后退一步，点头道："抱歉。"

"You can go away now," Asuka said, standing and sidling up next to her grandma's chair.  
"你现在可以走了，"明日香说着，站起身来，侧身靠近她奶奶的椅子。"

Ilka _tsked_. "Don't be rude, child." she said, to which Asuka pouted. Something white jiggled by her ears and Shinji realized she had pearls to match the ones hanging from Ilka's neck. Asuka wasn't clad in the usual dresses either, but instead wore a deep, oak leaf green that seemed just a little too big on her.  
伊尔卡咂了咂嘴。“别这么没礼貌，孩子。”她对明日香说道，后者随即撅起了嘴。一抹白色在她耳边晃动，真嗣这才注意到她戴着与伊尔卡脖子上挂着的相匹配的珍珠耳环。明日香也没有穿平时的裙子，而是换上了一件深橡树叶绿的长裙，看起来略显宽松。

"Shinji," the elder said, putting her back straight, "why don't you run off and wash up? Asuka and I will be along shortly."  
“真嗣，”长辈说道，挺直了背，“你为什么不先去洗漱一下？明日香和我一会儿就过来。”

Shinji did so, free from Asuka's glares and the stuffy smells – it didn't feel right. He didn't belong there. He was just some boy.  
真嗣照做了，摆脱了明日香的瞪视和沉闷的气味——这一切都让他感觉不对劲。他不属于这里。他只是个普通男孩。

The two came by his tiny house in the garden, though avoided going inside. Grandma Ilka spared Teacher little more than a cursory glance and he lent her much the same. A brief frown came to her lips as she took in his simple Japanese-inspired dwelling. It wasn't really much of a house, but more of a shack with extra rooms. Shinji preferred it that way. What would he do in a big house that didn't have lots of people? Wouldn't that be lonely?  
两人来到了他在花园中的小屋旁，却并未进去。伊尔卡奶奶对老师只是匆匆一瞥，而他回以同样的眼神。她看到他那简朴的日式小屋时，嘴角微微皱起，这算不上什么房子，更像是个带额外房间的棚屋。真嗣更喜欢这样。如果一个大房子里没有很多人，他会做什么呢？那不会很孤单吗？

Really, he wasn't any less alone here. He supposed it didn't really matter where someone lived when no one wanted them. It didn't feel good, but he was starting to get used to the idea.  
实际上，他在这里也并不孤单。他觉得，当没有人想要你时，住在哪里并不重要。这感觉并不好，但他开始习惯了这种想法。

Even if she didn't like where he lived out in the Langley's beautiful garden, Grandma Ilka was nothing but kind and patient. She didn't know a lick of Japanese, but didn't scowl at him when he stuttered his German. In her hands she carried what sounded like metal pipes, all wrapped in brown paper. Unfurling it, six copper tubes dangled from a platform of wood and string, echoing with a hollow ring that resonated over the air, as if the notes were floating. Ilka hung them on the back porch nearest his bedroom window.  
尽管伊尔卡奶奶不喜欢他住在兰利美丽的花园里，但她始终和蔼而耐心。她不懂日语，但当他结结巴巴地说德语时，她并没有皱眉。她手里拿着像是金属管的东西，都用棕色纸包裹着。展开后，六根铜管从木头和绳子搭成的平台上垂下，发出空灵的回响，仿佛音符在空中飘荡。伊尔卡将它们挂在他卧室窗边的后门廊上。

When he asked why, she said, "Because it invites good spirits to visit and keep you safe, child."  
当他问为什么时，她说：“因为这样可以邀请好精灵来访，保护你，孩子。”

Later, she sat them by the piano and taught them how to play some of the keys, while Asuka tried to bump him off the seat without Ilka noticing. There was dust on it when they first opened the lid and it had taken a few minutes to clean. Asuka couldn't quite reach all the notes for the lullaby Ilka was teaching them, but neither could he. So she had them play the notes on their respective sides when the song demanded it.  
后来，她让他们坐在钢琴旁，教他们如何弹奏一些键，而 Asuka 试图在不引起 Ilka 注意的情况下把他从座位上挤下去。他们第一次打开琴盖时上面有灰尘，花了好几分钟才清理干净。Asuka 弹奏 Ilka 教的摇篮曲时有些音符够不到，但他也一样。所以当歌曲需要时，她让他们各自弹奏自己那边的音符。

Ilka lived far in the south by Munich, so didn't get a chance to visit often. She was there only for a brief time, gone all too soon. After she left, his friend was, in a cruel sort of way, nicer to him. Shinji was allowed every so often to play the piano, just with her and only the songs she wanted to play. That was fine. There weren't any other songs he knew how to play anyway.  
Ilka 住在遥远的南方，靠近慕尼黑，所以不常有机会来访。她只在那里短暂停留，很快就离开了。她走后，他的朋友以一种残酷的方式对他变得更好了。真嗣偶尔被允许弹钢琴，只是和她一起，只弹她想弹的曲子。这样挺好。反正他也不会弹其他曲子。

However, for the night after Grandma Ilka departed, Shinji stowed his father's SDAT away. The ringing chimes at his window whisked him off to sleep, and he pretended it was his mother outside touching the bells.  
然而，在奶奶伊尔卡离开后的那个夜晚，真嗣将父亲的 SDAT 收了起来。窗外的钟声悠扬，将他带入了梦乡，他假装是母亲在外面轻触着铃铛。

### Chapter 4: The Letter
Seven-year-old Shinji Ikari cried out as he fell hard onto his back, a pair of hands pinning his shoulders to the ground.  
七岁的碇真嗣重重地摔倒在地，背部着地，一双小手紧紧按住他的肩膀。

"I win!" Asuka shouted, grinning as she rolled off him. Rising to sit, he sniffed, something wet sliding down his upper lip. Touching a finger to his nose, he found blood and frowned as he wiped a sleeve across his face, not sure at what point in their wrestling that had happened.  
“我赢了！”明日香大喊着，笑着从他身上滚开。他坐起身，吸了吸鼻子，感觉有什么湿漉漉的东西滑过上唇。用手指碰了碰鼻子，发现流血了，他皱着眉用袖子擦了擦脸，不确定在摔跤的哪个环节发生了这事。

When he stood, Asuka was already by the olive tree, carving a line into the trunk with a sharp rock. There were more marks down its left side than he cared to count, and over them was a big A. Across from it was a comparatively smaller S, which wore exactly 13 marks, and Asuka had definitely made sure those few victories weren't worth it. It was far easier to just lose – much fewer bruises that way.  
当他站起来时，明日香已经在橄榄树旁，用一块尖石头在树干上刻下痕迹。左边的标记比他愿意数的还要多，上面是一个大大的 A。对面是一个相对较小的 S，上面正好有 13 个标记，明日香显然确保了这几场胜利不值得。直接输掉要容易得多——那样留下的瘀伤也少得多。

Asuka glanced back at him and started climbing the olive tree while Shinji ran to catch up. The nooks and notches were worn and smooth from use, and they ascended to the crux in the winding trunk.  
明日香回头瞥了他一眼，开始攀爬橄榄树，而真嗣则跑着追上去。树上的凹槽因长期使用而变得光滑，他们沿着蜿蜒的树干向上攀登至树心。

It was difficult to believe he had spent nearly three years in Germany now. It didn't even feel that long. He was definitely a little taller than he remembered, with a little less fat here and there. Then again, he'd never had much to begin with, always being a bit of a lanky boy. But this year he was actually just a little taller than Asuka, much to her chagrin.  
很难相信他已经在德国度过了近三年。感觉并不算太久。他确实比记忆中高了一些，身上的脂肪也少了些许。不过，他原本就不胖，一直是个瘦削的男孩。但今年他竟然比明日香还要高一点，这让她颇为不爽。

Now, summer winds whispered through the trees, making it sound like the crash of the seashore. Asuka sat on the branch above him, feet bouncing against one another.  
此刻，夏日的微风穿过树林，发出宛如海浪拍岸的声音。明日香坐在他上方的树枝上，双脚轻轻地互相踢打。

"I'm going to tell you a secret," she said, staring into the treetops. "A while ago, they picked me to be an elite pilot and it's really important. But if you tell _anyone_, I'll hurt you."  
"我要告诉你一个秘密，"她凝视着树梢说道，"不久前，他们选我成为精英飞行员，这非常重要。但如果你告诉任何人，我会让你吃苦头。"

The threat went unheard as Shinji's face quirked. "Pilot? Like for airplanes?"  
这威胁对真嗣来说毫无影响，他的脸上露出一丝疑惑。"飞行员？像开飞机的那种？"

"No, dummy!" she snapped, batting him on the head. "I can't tell you, it's secret."  
"不是，傻瓜！"她厉声说道，轻轻拍了下他的头，"我不能告诉你，这是秘密。"

Her name rang out over the garden, a call from an unseen woman beyond the trees near the castle. Asuka's face twisted and she sat straight, lingering in place for a moment.  
她的名字在花园中回荡，是从城堡附近树木之外的一位看不见的女子传来的呼唤。明日香的脸色一变，挺直了身子，在原地停留了一会儿。

She regarded him with a serious expression. "Don't tell anybody," she said, climbing down from the tree and only stumbling a little as she ran off towards her red brick house.  
她严肃地看着他。“别告诉任何人，”她说着，从树上爬下来，跑向她那红砖房子时略微踉跄了一下。

Shinji watched her disappear, rubbing his head. He didn't see what the big deal was. It wasn't like he had anyone else to talk to. What the heck was she a pilot for anyway? What else did people pilot but airplanes? Was she talking about spaceships? The more and more Shinji thought about it, the more it made his head ache.  
真嗣看着她消失，揉了揉头。他不明白这有什么大不了的。反正他也没有其他人可以倾诉。她究竟是为什么成为驾驶员的呢？除了飞机，人们还能驾驶什么呢？她是在说太空船吗？真嗣越想越觉得头疼。

He never really complained or put up a fight when Asuka acted so weird all the time. If he did, she might leave. Even though it had been a year since they'd started playing again, every time she went home he feared it might be the last time he ever saw her, and anxiously awaited her visits day by day.  
他从未真正抱怨过或反抗过，当明日香总是表现得那么古怪时。如果他这么做了，她可能会离开。尽管他们重新开始玩游戏已经一年了，但每次她回家，他都担心那可能是最后一次见到她，于是焦急地一天天等待着她的来访。

As the sun began to set, Shinji knew it was time to return home. He made his way back through the low and humid air, his feet rattling the rocks as he stepped up to the front porch. Closing the door after himself, he set his small shoes off to the side next to Teacher's. The man grimaced as he padded into the living room, but didn't comment on his dirtied arms and grass-stained clothes. Shinji washed, bathed, and changed. As he did, he saw the SDAT player sitting on the edge of his table, cords wrapped around its frame.  
当太阳开始西沉，真嗣知道是时候回家了。他穿过低沉而潮湿的空气，脚步声在踏上前廊时震动了石子。关上门后，他将小鞋子放在老师旁边。男人皱着眉头走进客厅，但没有对真嗣沾满泥土的手臂和草渍的衣服发表评论。真嗣洗了澡，换了衣服。在此期间，他看到 SDAT 播放器放在桌边，线缆缠绕在框架上。

He picked it up, acid spilling into his veins and burning him from the inside. He tossed it to the other side of the room, resolving to sit and do worksheets until bedtime. As equations stretched over the pages and blurred together, he kept glancing back to the SDAT where it lay by his closet.  
他拿起它，酸液涌入血管，从内部灼烧着他。他把它扔到房间的另一边，决定坐下来做作业直到睡觉时间。随着方程式在页面上延伸并模糊成一片，他不断回头看向 SDAT 播放器，它躺在他的衣橱旁。

The time bled out forever, the paper under his pencil blank, all while chimes sang outside. Shinji stood, snatched up the music player and plopped down at his desk – nestling the buds in his ears.  
时间仿佛永远流逝，笔下的纸张空白一片，而外面的钟声却在歌唱。真嗣站起身，抓起音乐播放器，一屁股坐到桌前——将耳机塞入耳中。

---

The morning was crisp, as it always seemed to be in Germany. The stool Shinji used to reach the kitchen counter allowed him to see out the window and into his garden. The mists had dispersed and the waking birds sang their disjointed, but harmonious chorus. The bees had begun their work early, bouncing between the fluffy white edelweiss and sunset-burned fire lilies.  
清晨清新，德国似乎总是如此。真嗣用来够到厨房台面的凳子让他能看到窗外自己的花园。雾气已经散去，醒来的鸟儿唱着不连贯却和谐的合唱。蜜蜂早早开始了工作，在蓬松的白色雪绒花和夕阳般火红的百合花间跳跃。

"Your soup is boiling," Teacher said.  
“你的汤在沸腾，”老师说道。

Shinji looked to him, then to the pot and yelped – turning the heat off and fumbling to add the spring onions he had cut earlier. He slid the pot off the burner, mixing everything with a wooden spoon. Teacher twitched his nose at it and gave him a look that said, 'it will have to do'.  
真嗣看向他，又看向锅子，惊叫一声——迅速关掉火，手忙脚乱地加入之前切好的葱花。他将锅子从炉子上移开，用木勺搅拌着所有食材。老师抽了抽鼻子，给了他一个眼神，仿佛在说：‘勉强凑合吧’。

"Sorry," Shinji said, bowing far too low.  
“对不起，”真嗣说道，鞠躬鞠得太过头了。

Teacher was mute and they prepared the morning meal at the table. Miso soup, steamed rice and an omelet cooked with onions and green peppers. Once everything was laid out, he waited for Teacher to sit before doing so himself. He gave thanks, in Japanese and German, before grabbing the table's sake bottle to fill Teacher's cup. As he did, the man grabbed a white envelope from under the table and slid it across to him. It was blank save for a single red half-leaf in the upper left corner.  
老师沉默不语，他们一起准备早餐。味噌汤、蒸米饭和用洋葱与青椒炒的煎蛋。一切摆好后，他等老师先坐下，自己才坐下。他用日语和德语表示感谢，然后拿起桌上的清酒瓶，为老师的杯子斟满。就在这时，老师从桌下拿出一个白色信封，滑到他面前。信封上除了左上角的一片红色半叶外，别无他物。

His face pinched and he looked up. "What is it?"  
他的脸皱了起来，抬头问道：“什么事？”

"The sake." “清酒。”

"Wuh– ah!" the liquid spilled over the rim of the cup, and he knocked several dishes over trying to clean up the mess.  
“呃——啊！”液体溢出了杯沿，他在试图清理这团糟时还打翻了几个盘子。

Teacher sighed, but waited for him to finish.  
老师叹了口气，但还是等他讲完。

"A letter from your father," he finally said, taking a moment to pinch rice from his bowl. "You may read it once we are done eating."  
“你父亲的一封信，”他终于说道，顺手从碗里捏起几粒米饭。“等我们吃完饭你就可以读了。”

The miso soup was the first thing to go. It was the easiest to down without appearing indecent, with the minor consequence of practically scalding his throat. The rice, however, was more of a challenge. Shinji managed to stuff his mouth full when he thought Teacher might not notice. His portion of the omelet was soon devoured as well, but he succeeded only in finishing before Teacher did, whom he still had to wait on, as etiquette dictated.  
味噌汤是第一个被解决的。它最容易在不失礼的情况下一饮而尽，尽管几乎烫伤喉咙这个小小的代价。然而，米饭则更具挑战性。真嗣趁老师可能没注意到时，设法塞满了嘴巴。他的那份煎蛋卷也很快被消灭，但他只是比老师先吃完，按照礼仪，他仍需等待。

However, despite having never looked up at him once, Teacher nodded. Shinji snatched the envelope from the table and tore it open:  
然而，尽管从未抬头看他一眼，老师点了点头。真嗣从桌上抢过信封，撕开它：

Shinji's brow scrunched, nerves tingling warmly at his neck. He flipped the paper over, searching the back. But it was just this – artificially worded and with his father's name stamped on it.  
真嗣的眉头紧皱，颈部的神经微微发热。他将纸翻过来，寻找背面。但只有这些——人工措辞，并盖着他父亲的印章。

"Active duty? Training?" Shinji asked, the paper crunching in his hand. "What does this mean?"  
“现役？训练？”真嗣问道，手中的纸张被捏得沙沙作响。“这是什么意思？”

Teacher set down his soup bowl. "It means you have a great responsibility now."  
老师放下汤碗。“这意味着你现在肩负着重大的责任。”

"To do... what?" “做……什么？”

"What your father requires of you."  
“你父亲要求你做的事。”

Shinji frowned, looking back down at the paper. He remembered what Asuka had said, something about being a pilot. But what exactly was it his father wanted him to do?  
真嗣皱起眉头，再次低头看向那张纸。他想起了明日香说过的话，关于成为一名驾驶员的事情。但他父亲究竟希望他做什么呢？

"What's... _brain_?" he asked, pointing to the German word.  
"什么是... '大脑'？" 他指着德语单词问道。

Teacher didn't even look as he finished chewing a mouthful of omelet. "It is your father's work and it is for the benefit of all mankind."  
老师甚至没有抬头，一边咀嚼着嘴里的煎蛋一边说道："那是你父亲的工作，它是为了全人类的福祉。"

"My father's work..." Shinji repeated, holding the paper before him proper again. _It isn't fair_. He thought, throat tight and burning. He pursed his lips, resisting the urge to rip the letter up into a hundred tiny pieces. Teacher disliked such useless displays of emotion.  
"我父亲的工作..." 真嗣重复着，再次端正地拿着那张纸。这不公平。他想，喉咙紧绷且灼热。他抿紧嘴唇，强忍着将信撕成无数小碎片的冲动。老师不喜欢这种无谓的情感宣泄。

Rocks clattered outside, followed by fading footfalls. Shinji looked up, a bit of light creeping in down the hall from the open front door.  
石头在外面哗啦作响，随后是渐行渐远的脚步声。真嗣抬头望去，一缕光线从敞开的前门沿着走廊悄悄溜了进来。

---

"Time to go," Teacher said, slipping his shoes on. Shinji did the same and followed him around to the front of the mansion, where a black car was waiting for them.  
“该走了，”老师说着，穿上鞋子。真嗣也照做，跟着他绕到大宅前，一辆黑色轿车正在那里等候他们。

The countryside melted away to sprawling suburbs and cityscape. The buildings were much taller here, glittering blue glass and powerful gray concrete. There were dozens – hundreds of people and cars. Shinji could hardly take it all in. But they only passed around the city and never reached some of the taller skyscrapers, much to his disappointment. The buildings became sparse, until they rolled into an area with huge pipes that puffed black smoke, caged by metal towers with wires and other apparatuses he didn't have names for. The car ground to a halt in front of a building he could only describe as pressed flat, flanked by tall fences with spiraling razor wire at the top.  
乡村逐渐消失，取而代之的是蔓延的郊区和城市景观。这里的建筑高大得多，闪耀着蓝色玻璃和坚实的灰色混凝土。人潮和车流密集，真嗣几乎应接不暇。但他们只是绕城而过，并未抵达那些更高的摩天大楼，令他颇为失望。建筑逐渐稀疏，直到他们驶入一片区域，那里巨大的管道喷出黑色烟雾，被金属塔架和各种他叫不出名字的设备所包围。车子在一座他只能形容为被压扁的建筑前停下，两侧是高耸的围墙，顶端缠绕着螺旋状的锋利铁丝网。

As they got out, Shinji saw a marble tablet that read:  
他们下车时，真嗣看到一块大理石碑上刻着：

_Gehirn 脑研_

_Sum et, scio ut, ergo fui  
存在过，我知道，故我曾存在_

At the door, Teacher input a code and Shinji jumped as the door buzzed, drawn away by hydraulic snaps. He shivered as they entered, a wash of cold air spiraling down his shoulders and making goosebumps spread up his legs. His shoes squeaked as they stepped further in, the only noise in the whole building. There was a long white hallway that led to a window in the wall, two doors on either side of it.  
在门口，老师输入了一个密码，门嗡嗡作响，随着液压装置的咔嗒声打开，真嗣吓了一跳。他们进入后，一股冷气顺着他的肩膀旋转而下，腿上起了鸡皮疙瘩。他的鞋子吱吱作响，这是整栋建筑里唯一的声音。一条长长的白色走廊通向墙上的一个窗户，两侧各有两扇门。

Teacher handed someone on the other end some papers and they talked quietly. Shinji looked around and found a lone painting mounted on the plain beige walls. It was a strange landscape with naked people – and looked nothing like his garden. One of the people even had red hair.  
老师递给另一端的人一些文件，他们低声交谈。真嗣环顾四周，发现一幅孤零零的画挂在朴素的米色墙壁上。这是一幅奇怪的风景画，画着裸体的人——看起来一点也不像他的花园。其中一个人甚至有着红发。

A door creaked and Shinji turned to find a pale man with slicked back black hair, and glasses that made him think of an owl. The man, sparing a smile, looked to Teacher and bowed before offering his hand. His instructor bowed and then they shook. The man in white turned his dark blue-green eyes on Shinji, leaning over slightly as he spoke in German, "Good morning, little Shinji."  
一扇门吱吱作响，真嗣转身看到一个脸色苍白的男人，黑发向后梳得油光水滑，戴着眼镜让他想起了猫头鹰。那人微微一笑，看向老师并鞠了一躬，然后伸出手。他的导师鞠躬后，两人握了手。穿白衣服的男人将他深蓝绿色的眼睛转向真嗣，微微俯身用德语说道：“早上好，小真嗣。”

Shinji's face smarted. Even Asuka's dad called him _junger Herr_ now. _Young_ _Sir_ sounded way cooler than little Shinji. He was always little Shinji.  
真嗣的脸颊火辣辣的。就连明日香的爸爸现在也称呼他为“小先生”了。“年轻先生”听起来比“小真嗣”酷多了。他总是那个“小真嗣”。

The man just smiled and his shoulders shook with a huff. "I am Doctor Adrian Lützow. Follow me, please."  
那人只是微笑着，肩膀因轻笑而颤动。“我是阿德里安·吕措博士。请跟我来。”

Lützow opened the door and led Shinji through a labyrinth of glass panes that reached up to the ceiling, their lower halves covered with metal that warped his reflection. He was too short to see over them, so couldn't tell what was going on inside. After making a dizzying series of twists and turns down halls that felt too long, Lützow opened the door to one of the glass rooms, where a small table sat in the middle. Lützow took a seat one side, adjusting his big white coat. Shinji hesitated as the man looked to him expectantly and he glanced up at Teacher, who nodded towards the table.  
吕措打开门，领着真嗣穿过一个由直达天花板的玻璃隔板构成的迷宫，隔板下半部分覆盖着金属，扭曲了他的倒影。他太矮了，看不到里面的情况，所以在走过感觉过于漫长的走廊，经过一系列令人晕眩的转弯后，吕措打开了一间玻璃房的门，里面中间放着一张小桌子。吕措在一侧坐下，调整了一下他那件宽大的白大褂。真嗣犹豫不决，因为那人期待地看着他，他抬头看向老师，老师点头示意他走向桌子。

Shinji climbed onto chair opposite Lützow, sitting on his knees to be higher up since the table was made for adults. In front of him were four large cubes and one small one. The Doctor had the same on his side.  
真嗣爬上了卢佐对面的一把椅子，跪坐在上面以便更高一些，因为桌子是为成年人设计的。在他面前有四个大立方体和一个小的。医生那边也是同样的配置。

"Do you like to play games, Shinji?"  
“你喜欢玩游戏吗，真嗣？”

He nodded. 他点点头。

"So do I. Would you like to play?"  
"我也一样。你想玩吗？"

Another nod. 又一次点头。

"Okay, Shinji: I'm going to take my little cube and tap on these other cubes. When I'm done, I want you to take your cube there and copy me exactly. Can you do that? If you win our games today, I'll give you a special treat." with that, Lützow took his tiny cube and made Shinji repeat his patterns of tapping. After a little bit, it was hard to remember which ones he had tapped and in which order, but the man didn't say he'd lost – so he must have won when they finally stopped.  
""好的，真嗣：我要用我的小方块敲击这些其他方块。当我完成后，我希望你用你的方块在那里完全模仿我。你能做到吗？如果你今天赢了我们的游戏，我会给你一个特别的奖励。"" 说完，吕措拿起他的小方块，让真嗣重复他的敲击模式。过了一会儿，很难记住哪些方块被敲击过以及顺序，但那人没有说他输了——所以他们最终停下来时，他一定是赢了。

Lützow's pen scratched across his clipboard and the Doctor looked up at him again. "Very good, Shinji. There is one more thing before you go." He bent down nearby and set a piece of paper on the table, as well as a small box of crayons every color of his garden. "I want you to draw yourself."  
吕措的笔在夹板上沙沙作响，医生再次抬头看向他。“很好，真嗣。在你离开之前，还有一件事。”他在附近弯下腰，将一张纸放在桌上，还有一盒五彩缤纷的蜡笔，就像他花园里的各种颜色。“我想让你画出你自己。”

Shinji's brow pinched and his lips pouted in thought as he stared at the blank paper. He glanced at the glass walls, but they were foggy and blurred. So he turned back and said, "I don't know what I look like."  
真嗣的眉头紧锁，嘴唇微微撅起，陷入沉思地盯着那张白纸。他瞥了一眼玻璃墙，但它们雾蒙蒙的，模糊不清。于是他转回身说：“我不知道自己长什么样。”

Lützow smiled. "Just draw what you think you look like."  
吕措微笑道：“就画出你认为的样子吧。”

Shinji frowned, but took one of the crayons and started to draw anyway. He began with the head, of course, marking his way down to the body and glancing at his clothes a few times to check what color they were.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，但还是拿起一支蜡笔开始画画。他当然是从头部开始，一路画到身体，还不时瞥一眼自己的衣服检查颜色。

So focused on his task, he almost didn't notice as Teacher asked, "Why the drawing?"  
他如此专注于任务，几乎没注意到老师问道：“为什么要画画？”

Shinji lifted his head but neither of them were paying any particular attention to him. Lützow looked up from his clipboard and nodded to the paper, so Shinji went back to drawing, the Doctor's quiet voice followed soon after.  
真嗣抬起头，但两人都没有特别注意他。吕措从他的写字板上抬起头，对纸点了点头，于是真嗣继续画画，医生的轻声细语很快随之而来。

"It is to give us a general idea of his current state of mind, based on how he perceives himself. It helps us learn how he thinks and gives us clues as to why. Now keep in mind I can't tell you much without proper clearance, you understand."  
"这是为了让我们大致了解他当前的心理状态，基于他如何看待自己。这有助于我们了解他的想法，并提供线索解释原因。现在请记住，没有适当的许可，我不能告诉你太多，你明白吗？"

Shinji's brow furrowed, thoroughly lost. He heard Teacher grunt. "Of course."  
真嗣的眉头紧皱，完全迷失了方向。他听到老师咕哝了一声。"当然。"

"Good, just know it will allow us to predict potential irregularities in the neural impulse system, and hopefully correct them down the line. As you can see, the small figure and lack of legs denotes instability and insecurity. Thus far he has arms, but the hands are hidden behind his back – difficulty with communication. Also note that the face is lacking in more distinct features with the exception of eyes – he has a very weak sense of identity."  
"很好，要知道这将使我们能够预测神经冲动系统中的潜在异常，并有望在后续纠正它们。正如你所见，这个小巧的身形和缺失的腿部表示不稳定和不安全感。到目前为止他有手臂，但双手隐藏在背后——沟通困难。还要注意，除了眼睛外，面部缺乏明显的特征——他的自我认同感非常薄弱。"

Shinji fell out of the conversation after that. He didn't really get it anyway and Teacher would only scold him if he asked questions. When he was done drawing, Lützow clipped the paper to his board and stood. "Alright, _junger Herr_, we're all done for the day. You did very well and I will see you again tomorrow." he said and held out a lollypop. Shinji snatched it from his hand and tore the wrapper off, deciding that perhaps Doctor Lützow wasn't so bad afterall.  
自那以后，真嗣便不再参与对话。反正他也不太明白，而且如果提问，老师只会责骂他。画完后，吕措将纸夹在画板上站起身来。“好了，年轻的先生，今天的工作结束了。你做得很好，我们明天再见。”他说着递给真嗣一根棒棒糖。真嗣从他手中一把夺过，撕开包装纸，心想或许吕措医生也没那么糟糕。

When they returned to the Langley estate later in the day, it was straight back to lessons. The silver clock on the wall said it was six when Teacher dismissed him early. He wasn't sure why, but wasn't going to stick around to complain.  
当天晚些时候回到兰利庄园时，他们直接回到了课堂。墙上的银色时钟显示六点时，老师提前让他下课了。他不确定原因，但也没打算留下来抱怨。

Outside, there were tinges of light left from the retreating afternoon, although it was dark enough for someone to trip over a rock if they weren't careful.  
外面，夕阳的余晖依稀可见，尽管天色已暗到若不小心就可能被石头绊倒。

"Oww!" a girlish voice wailed.  
“哎哟！”一个少女的声音哀嚎道。

Shinji searched the brush. It could only be– "Asuka?" he asked, poking his head around the other side of a tree, but finding no one around. Disappointed, he turned around and continued through the brush, passing by a stream towards the small little grove that hid the old shed. As the bugs and critters continued to call in the twilight, every now and then a twig would break or leaves would crunch, but he found no one there the moment he spun around. One time he thought he saw a flash of red.  
真嗣在灌木丛中搜寻着。只可能是——“明日香？”他问道，从树的另一侧探出头来，却没发现任何人。失望之余，他转身继续穿过灌木丛，经过一条小溪，向那片隐藏着旧棚屋的小树林走去。随着暮色中虫鸣不断，不时会有树枝折断或树叶沙沙作响，但他每次转身都未见人影。有一次，他以为看到了一抹红色。

The stars were clear in the sky by the time he came to the hollowed out husk. He sat in the grass, losing himself in the feeling of awe and majesty. They were always so bright as they blanketed the sky with their light, especially out here where the city rays couldn't hide them. According to Teacher, one day some of the stars would disappear because years and years away they had already died, it just took longer for their light to reach Earth. The idea made Shinji cold, like when the gray rains kept him inside. At the same time, it filled him with wonder that a star could still burn after it was gone.  
当他来到那座空壳般的棚屋时，天空中的星星已经清晰可见。他坐在草地上，沉浸在敬畏与庄严的感觉中。星星总是如此明亮，它们的光芒覆盖着天空，尤其是在这里，城市的灯光无法掩盖它们。据老师说，有一天一些星星会消失，因为它们在遥远的岁月前就已经死去，只是它们的光芒需要更长时间才能到达地球。这个想法让真嗣感到寒冷，就像灰蒙蒙的雨天让他只能待在室内一样。与此同时，这让他充满了惊奇，一颗星星在消逝后仍能继续闪耀。

"So what if they picked you too."  
"就算他们也选中了你又怎样。"

Asuka stood over the pit and he jumped back against a rotting piece of wood. She hopped down and kicked him in the leg. "That doesn't make you special!"  
明日香站在坑边，他向后一跳，靠在一块腐烂的木头上。她跳下来，踢了他的腿一脚。"那并不代表你有什么特别的！"

"W-what?" "什...什么？"

"Don't be dumb!" Asuka stood over him, hair lit up by the moon. She pressed a hand against his chest to pin him, the look in her eyes making his heart quiver. "I was picked first," she said, pushing hard, "don't _ever_ forget it!"  
"别犯傻了！"明日香站在他上方，月光照亮了她的头发。她用手按住他的胸口，将他固定住，她眼中的神情让他的心跳加速。"我是第一个被选中的，"她用力推着，"永远别忘了这一点！"

She turned and ran off into the night, releasing the stinging pressure on his lungs. He grabbed at the spot her hand had been, legs curling up to his chest. Picked first? Shinji didn't even know what he was doing here. All he understood was that it was important to his father. So if he kept doing whatever it was Teacher and Lützow told him to do, father would come for him.  
她转身消失在夜色中，他感到肺部的刺痛压力得以释放。他抓住她手曾触碰过的地方，双腿蜷缩至胸前。被选中了？真嗣甚至不知道自己在这里做什么。他只知道这对父亲很重要。所以，只要他继续按照老师和吕佐夫的指示去做，父亲就会来接他。

Wouldn't he? 他不会来吗？

---

Dark clouds billowed over the gardens, making the leaves shiver as the winds danced through them. But Shinji knew it wouldn't rain today. Normally it got stuffy and hot before that happened, making the plants shimmer with sparkling water, while the greens and purples and reds glowed vibrantly in the next day's scorching heat.  
乌云在花园上空翻滚，使得树叶在风中颤抖。但真嗣知道今天不会下雨。通常在下雨前会变得闷热，植物在闪耀的水珠中闪烁，而绿色、紫色和红色在次日酷热的阳光下显得格外鲜艳。

The mulch was soggy as Shinji walked down a familiar path, a thick, raw pine smell clogging his nose. He had to go off the marked trail for one that was discreet, but well trodden. There he found the huge olive tree that lorded over its small clearing, the grass and rocks worn at from years of play.  
新治沿着一条熟悉的小径走着，覆盖着腐叶的地面湿漉漉的，一股浓烈的松木原始气息堵塞着他的鼻子。他不得不离开标记清晰的小径，转而寻找一条隐蔽但已被频繁踩踏的路。在那里，他找到了那棵巨大的橄榄树，它主宰着这片小小的空地，草地和岩石因多年的嬉戏而磨损。

Looking up, the fat tree curled upwards with its strange trunk, splitting down the middle as the branches parted and blanketed the clearing with a pleasing umbrella of shade. The tiny dark green leaves glistened, as did the olives that remained on their branches. They had ripened now, changing from a bright green to a purplish black.  
抬头望去，那棵粗壮的树向上蜷曲着它奇特的树干，从中一分为二，枝条分开，像一把宜人的伞一样遮蔽了空地。那些细小的深绿色叶子闪闪发光，挂在枝头的橄榄也是如此。它们现在已经成熟，从鲜绿色变成了紫黑色。

He could actually climb the olive tree pretty well on his own – though Asuka was still much better at it.  
他其实可以自己很好地爬上那棵橄榄树——尽管明日香仍然比他更擅长。

It always seemed so much harder by himself.  
独自一人时，总感觉格外艰难。

The thought made his face pinch, so he started to climb. As he reached the notch in the trunk where the branches split off, he realized all of the olives within reach had been picked already. Tearing away one of the empty bundles of leaves, he resolved to climb higher for his prize.  
这个念头让他的脸颊紧绷，于是他开始攀爬。当他到达树干上分叉处的凹口时，他意识到所有够得着的橄榄都已经被摘走了。他撕下一片空荡荡的叶子束，决心为了奖赏爬得更高。

He must have nearly made it to the top, because the world looked far away when he glanced down. Fear pulled at his heart and he clung to the tree branches tighter. Asuka had fallen out of the tree a lot when they first started playing. But not anymore, she was like the monkeys he read about in his books – ascending easily and effortlessly. Swallowing, Shinji looked back up to the bundle of black olives, just a few more feet beyond his reach.  
他一定快爬到顶了，因为当他低头看时，世界显得很遥远。恐惧揪住了他的心，他更紧地抱住树枝。明日香在他们刚开始玩的时候经常从树上掉下来。但现在不了，她就像他在书里读到的猴子一样——轻松自如地攀爬。咽了口唾沫，真嗣抬头看向那束黑橄榄，只差几英尺就能触及。

Cracking the branch free – it had the most on it – he started his descent. As he neared the bottom, he jumped off, nearly tumbling to the ground face first. That was when he noticed a sliver of red poking out from the other side of the tree.  
他用力折断那根挂果最多的树枝，开始向下爬。接近地面时，他一跃而下，差点脸朝地摔倒。就在这时，他注意到树的另一侧露出一抹红色。

Asuka was standing by the trunk, an air of indecision hovering about her in the way she lingered close to the tree with her hands pressed up against it, watching him.  
明日香站在树干旁，犹豫不决的气息在她身上萦绕，她双手紧贴着树干，目光紧随着他。

He held out the branch to her. Glancing from him to it, she snatched off a handful of olives and started fishing out the cores. So he sat down, plucking out his own while still holding out the branch, which she would pick from every so often until the thing was nearly barren. When she eventually sat down amidst the roots with him, he assumed he must have been forgiven for whatever it was he'd done.  
他将树枝递给她。她瞥了他一眼，又看向树枝，迅速摘下一把橄榄，开始挑出果核。于是他坐下，一边自己摘果核，一边仍举着树枝，她时不时地从上面摘取，直到树枝几乎光秃。当她最终坐在他身边的树根上时，他猜想自己一定已经得到了她的原谅，无论他做了什么。

"I wonder if they picked other kids to pilot," he said, daring a furtive glance to see if he'd provoked a reaction.  
"我在想他们是不是选了其他孩子来驾驶，"他说着，鼓起勇气偷偷瞥了一眼，想看看是否引起了反应。

"Of course they did, dummy," she almost sighed, pulling her eyes away from the castle and sparing him an annoyed squint.  
"当然选了，傻瓜，"她几乎叹了口气，目光从城堡上移开，不耐烦地瞥了他一眼。

"Then why aren't they here?"  
"那他们怎么不在这儿？"

"How should I know?" "我怎么知道？"

He shrugged, sitting up and crossing his legs. "I wonder how many there are?"  
他耸耸肩，坐起身来，盘起双腿。"我在想有多少个呢？"

She tossed one of the olive cores at him. "My papa says you're the Third."  
她将一个橄榄核扔向他。"我爸爸说你是第三个。"

_Purpose: Third Child, Pilot,_ the letter from his father had said. Wait, if he was the Third, why were there only two of them here?  
目的：第三子，驾驶员，他父亲的信中如此写道。等等，如果他是第三子，为什么这里只有两个人？

"Does that mean you're the First?" he asked – then paused, thinking better of it, "who's the Second?"  
“那你是第一子吗？”他问道——随即顿了顿，觉得这样问不太妥当，“第二子是谁？”

Asuka's eyes flashed. "It doesn't matter. Just a stupid number," she grumbled, jaw tight. The girl folded her knees up to her chest, hugging her arms around them as a hard look came over her expression. "I'm going to be the best."  
明日香的眼神一闪。“无所谓了。只是个愚蠢的编号，”她咕哝着，下巴紧绷。女孩将膝盖抱到胸前，双臂环绕着它们，表情变得坚毅。“我要成为最棒的。”

That took Shinji aback, silencing any other thoughts he might have wanted to voice. Yet the air that settled over them was companionable and they sat in the quiet of the garden for a little while longer, sharing in the shade of the tree.  
这让真嗣感到意外，打消了他原本想说的话。然而，空气中弥漫着一种友好的氛围，他们在花园的宁静中又坐了一会儿，共享着树荫下的清凉。

---

It wasn't long before the two resumed their regular routine, albeit with a bossier Asuka. All the while, Shinji's body ached. It was an itch in the back of his brain, as though he'd have to dig into his own skull and scratch at membrane just to subdue it. He didn't sleep very well at night, faceless wraiths spilling ominous shadows over his dreams.  
不久后，两人恢复了日常的作息，只是明日香变得更加专横。与此同时，真嗣的身体一直隐隐作痛。这感觉就像是他必须深入自己的大脑，刮擦那层薄膜才能缓解。他晚上睡得并不好，无脸的幽灵在他的梦中投下不祥的阴影。

It was one of the few reasons he'd journeyed deep into the garden today, to places not even the groundskeeper Gepard traversed anymore. You could tell because it was riddled with the yellow dandelion weeds. They came here not so long ago to play with Tank. Asuka hadn't liked coming back since he left.  
这是他今天深入花园的原因之一，来到了连园丁杰帕德都未曾涉足的地方。你可以看出这一点，因为这里到处都是黄色的蒲公英杂草。不久前他们还带着坦克来这里玩耍。自从坦克离开后，明日香就不太愿意再回到这里。

The clouds drifted overhead, completely free and without worry. Shinji wondered what it would be like to be one of those clouds. What it would be like to just sail in the sky forever with just the birds and mists to keep him company.  
云朵在头顶飘过，完全自由且无忧无虑。真嗣想知道成为其中一朵云会是什么感觉。那种永远在天空中航行，只有鸟儿和薄雾作伴的感觉。

For now, he was sitting in the abandoned shed Asuka had found him in nights ago, watching the sky pass by while cooled under the patchwork shade of the trees. Sunlight doused the leaves of the oaks and maples and birches, making them glow. The music from his SDAT danced in his ears, adding a serene quality to the forest around him. He liked it when he could pretend the world was always this beautiful. He felt it reminded him of something – or someone. He could never really be sure, since it came only as a half-remembered dream, indistinct and shapeless. It was more like a feeling than anything else.  
眼下，他坐在几天前明日香找到他的废弃小屋里，在树荫拼凑的凉爽下看着天空流逝。阳光洒在橡树、枫树和桦树的叶子上，让它们闪闪发光。他 SDAT 播放的音乐在他耳边跳跃，为周围的森林增添了一份宁静。他喜欢假装世界总是如此美丽。他觉得这让他想起了什么——或某个人。他永远无法真正确定，因为它只以半记忆的梦境形式出现，模糊不清且无形。这更像是一种感觉，而非其他任何东西。

"Whatcha' doin'?" red hair cascaded over his sight, a pair of blue eyes demanding his attention.  
“你在做什么？”红发垂落在他眼前，一双蓝眼睛迫切地吸引着他的注意。

Shinji's face twisted and he pulled his earbuds out, pointing past her. "Clouds."  
真嗣的脸扭曲了一下，他拔出耳塞，指着她身后。“云。”

Asuka rolled her eyes. "That's boring!" she whined, grabbing his right arm and yanking him up. Shinji didn't resist. "Come on," she said, marching him out of the valley and up towards the castle.  
明日香翻了个白眼。“真无聊！”她抱怨着，抓住他的右臂，把他拽了起来。真嗣没有反抗。“走吧，”她说着，带着他走出山谷，向城堡走去。

"Why?" "为什么？"

"I wanna' climb the olive tree."  
“我想爬那棵橄榄树。”

"Do it by yourself..." Shinji grumbled and received a stinging flick on the nose. "Ow!" he cried, falling on his rump and shooting her a sour look, one hand rubbing his red nose.  
"自己动手..." 真嗣嘟囔着，结果被狠狠地弹了一下鼻子。"哎哟！" 他叫了一声，跌坐在地上，用怨恨的眼神瞪着她，一只手揉着发红的鼻子。

"What are you being so weird for?" she asked, brow scrunched.  
"你干嘛这么奇怪？" 她皱着眉头问道。

Shinji bit back the mean words on the tip of his tongue. He wasn't weird. He didn't voice the protest, she would only punch him or kick him and he was _not_ getting beat up by a girl today. Instead, he crossed his legs, hands clasping his ankles as he rocked on his butt, eyes fuzzing with green as he stared into the grass. "It's been a whole three years and... he still hasn't come for me. He said I'd only be gone for a while."  
真嗣忍住了即将脱口而出的刻薄话。他并不奇怪。他没有说出抗议，她只会揍他或踢他，他今天可不想被一个女孩打。相反，他交叉双腿，双手抱住脚踝，坐在地上摇晃着，眼神因绿色而变得模糊，盯着草地发呆。"已经整整三年了... 他还是没有来接我。他说我只是暂时离开。"

Shinji knew very well what the letter had said. He'd wasted away hours in his room reading it over and over until he was sick. It said he was supposed to be trained for the next five years, but why couldn't he go back and do that stuff there with him?  
真嗣非常清楚信中写了什么。他在房间里反复阅读，直到感到恶心，浪费了无数个小时。信上说他应该接受接下来五年的训练，但为什么他不能回去和他一起在那里做那些事呢？

Asuka asked him once why he had come here. He'd told her because his dad had sent him away. They didn't really talk much about it again, but she'd been... gentler around him after that, nicer, even. At least, nice in the same sense that a lion only scratched your arm open instead of out right eating you. He wondered, briefly, if all girls were like that.  
明日香曾问他为什么来到这里。他告诉她是因为他爸爸把他送走了。他们没有再深入谈论这件事，但自那以后，她对他变得温柔了些，更好了，甚至可以说是像狮子只抓破你的手臂而不是直接吃掉你那样。他短暂地想，是不是所有的女孩都这样。

Asuka shrugged. "Maybe he doesn't want you."  
明日香耸了耸肩。"也许他并不想要你。"

"That's not true!" “那不是真的！”

"Then why hasn't he come back for you yet?" she sneered, leaning forward.  
“那他为什么还没回来找你？”她冷笑着，身体前倾。

Shinji looked away. "That's– that's because he... he just..." his hands folded tight and he wanted to hit something. But she was right, wasn't she? If he'd learned anything about Asuka, it was how much smarter she was than him, so of course she would know about this stuff too.  
真嗣移开了视线。“那是因为他……他只是……”他的双手紧紧交握，真想揍点什么。但她说的没错，不是吗？如果他学到了关于明日香的一点，那就是她比他聪明得多，所以她当然也知道这些事情。

Shinji's nose twitched and his mouth tugged down. He squeezed his eyes shut – maybe if he pretended hard enough, it would be a dream. Maybe his father really was coming back for him–  
真嗣的鼻子抽动了一下，嘴角也向下拉。他紧闭双眼——也许他假装得够努力，这就会是一场梦。也许他的父亲真的会回来接他——

"What are you crying for?" Asuka snarled. Shinji opened his eyes to find the world a blur, his face streaked and wet. His friend was standing and glaring at him, fists clenched at her sides. "Stop it!" she shouted, shoving him. "Crying is for babies!"  
“你哭什么？”明日香咆哮道。真嗣睁开眼睛，发现世界一片模糊，脸上满是泪痕。他的朋友站在那里，怒视着他，双拳紧握在身侧。“别哭了！”她大喊着，推了他一把。“哭是婴儿才做的事！”

"I'm not a baby!" he wailed. The rosebush came to him again, the scarlet liquid that smelled like metal spilling over his arm and onto his clothes, while she left him there next to that strange flower.  
“我不是婴儿！”他哭喊道。那丛玫瑰再次出现在他眼前，鲜红的液体散发着金属味，溢满他的手臂，浸透了他的衣服，而她却把他留在那朵奇怪的花旁。

"Yes you are," she sighed, though there was still a sneer in her voice. It made his shoulders sag and he waited for her to leave, staring at the weeds by his ankles without really seeing them – feeling like he was falling out of his own body.  
“是的，你就是，”她叹息道，尽管语气中仍带着一丝嘲讽。这让他肩膀下垂，他等待着她离开，目光空洞地盯着脚踝旁的杂草——感觉自己仿佛正从身体中滑落。

"Why do you always listen to that?" Asuka asked, drawing his eyes up, but she wasn't looking at him, glued instead to his SDAT. She was sitting down now too. He didn't remember when she had done so or how long they'd been there. Some of the light in the sky had faded.  
“你为什么总是听那个？”明日香问道，吸引了他的目光，但她并未看向他，而是紧盯着他的 SDAT。她现在也坐下了。他不记得她何时坐下，也不记得他们已经在这里待了多久。天空中的一些光线已经消逝。

Shinji shrugged with a half-grimace, heat burning against his lungs. He considered her expression for a moment, trying to figure out what she could be thinking. She wouldn't meet his eyes though.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，带着半是苦笑的表情，热气灼烧着他的肺部。他仔细观察她的表情，试图猜出她在想什么。但她始终没有与他目光相接。

"My dad gave it to me when he..." Shinji looked to the grass between his legs, a hand snapping some of the blades free. "When he sent me away..."  
"我爸在我...他..." 真嗣目光转向双腿间的草地，一只手猛地扯断了几根草叶。"他把我送走的时候..."

Asuka's lips pursed. "Do you hate 'im?"  
明日香的嘴唇紧抿。"你恨他吗？"

Shinji shrugged again and they were soon consumed by the drone of the cicada bugs, and he almost wanted her to leave. He didn't deserve her company anyway and he couldn't blame her if she left. Maybe one day he'd learn how to be... normal. But... if she did decide to stay... he wouldn't hate her for it, even if she did say mean things.  
真嗣再次耸了耸肩，他们很快就被蝉鸣声淹没，他几乎希望她离开。无论如何，他不配拥有她的陪伴，如果她选择离开，他也不会怪她。也许有一天，他会学会如何变得...正常。但是...如果她真的决定留下...即使她说些刻薄的话，他也不会因此讨厌她。

Asuka stood then. "Shinjiii!" she whined, grabbing his wrists. "Come on, I wanna' climb the olive tree!" she pulled him to his feet, tugging him along insistently. He stumbled, one arm still held in her hand as they trudged through the wild pink soapworts.  
明日香站了起来。“真嗣！”她抱怨着，抓住他的手腕。“快点，我想爬橄榄树！”她把他拉起来，坚持不懈地拽着他。他踉跄了一下，一只手臂仍被她握着，两人穿过野生的粉色肥皂草丛。

Despite himself, for just a moment, a smile poked at his lips.  
尽管他不愿承认，但有那么一瞬间，他的嘴角还是露出了微笑。

我存在，我知晓，故我愿：因为我存在，我知道，所以我愿意。

### Chapter 5: Strength
Shinji was a creature of habit, perhaps akin to the Mongoose – forging through the world by his lonesome, hunting and burrowing. He had his routine and he stuck by it when he could. Asuka, on the other hand, was a wild and uncontrollable storm, thundering and raining where she pleased no matter how much it upset the balance of things.  
真嗣是个习惯的生物，或许类似于猫鼬——独自穿越世界，狩猎和挖掘。他有他的日常，尽可能地坚持着。而明日香则是一场狂野且无法控制的风暴，无论多么扰乱事物的平衡，她都随心所欲地雷鸣和降雨。

Despite that, there was still a pattern: a familiarity in the garden and the olive tree. Slowly, new threads would be introduced to the pattern, but for the most part it remained the same.  
尽管如此，花园与橄榄树间仍有一种熟悉的模式。渐渐地，新的线索会被引入这模式中，但大部分依旧如故。

Today was different. He was entirely beyond any form of routine he'd come to know and couldn't help but be reminded of those short months ago at Gehirn.  
今天不同。他完全超出了他所知的任何常规，不禁想起了几个月前在 Gehirn 的那段短暂时光。

---

Shinji was being taken through what he had come to name the Glass Labyrinth, still not quite tall enough to see what hid behind those shimmering panes. Lützow, the master of this strange realm, was leading the way. By now, Shinji had a good idea of how long it took them to reach the vault the doctor normally tested him in, and the way they took now was tantalizingly fresh. Teacher _had_ mentioned something about new tests. Mutual cooperation?  
真嗣正被带着穿过他称之为玻璃迷宫的地方，尽管他仍不够高，无法看清那些闪烁的玻璃板后隐藏着什么。吕措，这个奇异领域的掌控者，正引领着道路。如今，真嗣已大致知道他们到达医生通常测试他的那个保险库需要多长时间，而他们现在走的路则令人心痒难耐地新鲜。老师提到过一些关于新测试的事情。相互合作？

At last Lützow opened the door to yet another glass vault, revealing a red mane he knew well.  
终于，吕措打开了另一扇玻璃保险库的门，露出了一头他熟悉的红色鬃毛。

"Asuka?" he asked, moving to the open chair beside her. The girl greeted him with little more than a sniff and an upturned nose. Ah. He'd seen this Asuka before, and knew that this was not going to be a pleasant visit to Gehirn. Ignorant of his trepidation, Lützow gave them each a pencil and paper with zigzagging lines.  
“明日香？”他问道，走向她旁边的空椅子。女孩对他的到来仅以一声轻哼和一个翘起的鼻子作为回应。啊，他见过这样的明日香，知道这次访问 GEHIRN 不会是愉快的经历。对他的不安一无所知，吕措给了他们每人一支铅笔和一张画有曲折线条的纸。

"Today, you are each going to solve several mazes. Do not lift your pencil from the paper once you start, backtracking is not allowed and if you run into a dead end, you will have to redo the maze. You have fifteen seconds to complete the first maze."  
今天，你们每人要解决几个迷宫。一旦开始，铅笔不得离开纸面，不允许回溯，如果遇到死胡同，你必须重做迷宫。你有十五秒时间完成第一个迷宫。

Signaling the start with two taps of his pencil on his clipboard, they began. The minutes ticked by and new sleeves of paper appeared in front of them, the mazes getting harder and harder as they went. They were evenly matched for a while, until Shinji's confidence dwindled as Asuka finished the last two before him. She stuck her tongue out and smiled, while he resisted the urge to reach over with his pencil and scribble that stupid grin off her face.  
他用铅笔在夹板上敲了两下示意开始，他们便开始了。时间一分一秒过去，新的纸卷出现在他们面前，迷宫越来越难。他们一度势均力敌，直到真嗣的信心随着明日香在他之前完成最后两个而逐渐减弱。她伸出舌头笑了笑，而他忍住了用铅笔在她脸上乱画的冲动。

As Asuka completed the last one exactly on time, yet again, Shinji howled in frustration – throwing his pencil down and crossing his arms as he sank in his seat. Asuka just snickered and kicked her legs.  
当明日香再次准时完成最后一个迷宫时，真嗣懊恼地大叫——扔下铅笔，交叉双臂，沉坐在座位上。明日香只是窃笑并踢着双腿。

Lützow hummed as his white-blue eyes scanned over them, pencil thumping against his lips. He made several marks on his clipboard, washing the worry from his expression as he fetched two more sleeves of paper. "Alright, I have one last game for you two – sit up now, Shinji. This one, however, will require you to work together to finish."  
吕措轻哼着，他那白蓝色的眼睛扫视着他们，铅笔轻敲着嘴唇。他在写字板上做了几个记号，表情中的忧虑随之消散，随后又取来两卷纸。“好了，我给你们两个最后一个游戏——现在坐直，真嗣。不过这个游戏需要你们合作完成。”

Pushing himself back up, but refusing to sit straight despite the warning look Teacher gave him, Shinji waited for the next test he was sure to lose. Their mazes were taken away and new sheets slipped in front of them, except each one cut the maze down the middle.  
真嗣重新坐起，尽管老师投来警告的目光，他仍拒绝坐直，等待着下一个他确信会输的测试。他们的迷宫图被收走，新的试卷滑到他们面前，只是每张试卷上的迷宫都被从中切开。

Lützow elaborated. "I have given you each one half of a larger maze. There is a starting point on your respective papers. To finish the maze, you will have to cross onto each other's paper. However–" he paused, gaze lingering on Asuka for a moment, "in order to win, both of you must finish within the ten second marker."  
吕措进一步解释道：“我给你们每人一半的大迷宫。你们的试卷上各有一个起点。要完成迷宫，你们必须跨越到对方的试卷上。然而——”他顿了顿，目光在明日香身上停留片刻，“为了获胜，你们俩都必须在十秒标记内完成。”

Shinji and Asuka shared a glance, ire flickering through her eyes. He felt his face tighten and sat a little straighter as they touched their papers together to make the mazes line up. It was huge and he gave up on trying to find a path to Asuka's side as it turned into a blur of lines. He hovered his pencil over the starting point nonetheless, poised to mark the quickest route.  
真嗣和明日香交换了一个眼神，她眼中闪过一丝怒意。他感到自己的脸绷紧了，坐得更直了些，他们将纸张拼接在一起，让迷宫的线条对齐。迷宫巨大无比，他放弃了寻找通往明日香那边的路径，线条变得模糊不清。尽管如此，他还是将铅笔悬停在起点上方，准备标记出最快的路线。

"Begin." “开始。”

No sooner had Shinji started scrawling than Asuka's arm knocked into his, both snapping his led and causing her pencil to lift.  
真嗣刚一动手画线，明日香的手臂就撞了过来，不仅折断了他的铅笔，还让她的铅笔也抬了起来。

"No, stupid!" "不，笨蛋！"

"Miss Soryu," Lützow said in a tone Shinji was all too familiar with. She made a face but didn't call him anymore names, settling for pinching his hand instead.  
"丽苏鲁小姐，" 吕佐夫用一种真嗣再熟悉不过的语气说道。她做了个鬼脸，但没有再骂他，只是改为捏他的手。

"Plan where you're going _first,_" she whispered.  
"先计划好你要去的地方，" 她低声说。

Lützow began the test again and Shinji did what Asuka said, pausing as his eyes tracked the correct path. As he started his pencil's perilous journey, a low hiss next to him that might've been a curse sounded as Asuka ran into a dead end.  
吕措再次开始测试，真嗣按照明日香说的去做，目光随着正确的路径停顿。当他开始铅笔的危险之旅时，旁边传来一声低低的嘶声，可能是明日香的诅咒，因为她遇到了死胡同。

The third time they found the correct path, but bumped one another's arms as they crossed sides. There just wasn't enough room on the maze!  
第三次他们找到了正确的路径，但在交换位置时撞到了彼此的手臂。迷宫上根本没有足够的空间！

Before the fourth try, Asuka gave him a look that promised retribution later if he failed, and he returned as stern a look as a seven-and-a-half year old could hope to muster. When they started, he ticked off the seconds in his head, each of them careful to avoid the other's path – bending their hands at odd angles to get by. They both smacked their pencils on the table as they finished, just a fraction of a second before they would have lost.  
在第四次尝试之前，明日香给了他一个眼神，暗示如果他失败了，稍后会有报复，而他则回以一个七岁半孩子所能尽力摆出的严肃表情。当他们开始时，他在脑海中计算着秒数，两人都小心翼翼地避开对方的路线——以奇怪的角度弯曲手腕通过。他们几乎同时用铅笔敲击桌面完成，仅在输掉比赛前的一刹那。

Lützow made them finish tests together at Gehirn from then on, which Asuka still managed to turn into a competition.  
从那时起，吕佐夫让他们在 Gehirn 一起完成测试，而明日香仍然设法将其变成了一场竞赛。

---

Today, as he had come to expect of the storm that was Asuka, he was yet again being swept off his feet to be carried somewhere new... and not entirely welcome. Teacher said it was time to start socializing him.  
今天，正如他所预料到的明日香这股风暴，他又一次被卷走，带到了一个全新的地方……并非完全受欢迎。老师说现在是时候让他开始社交了。

As now eight-year-old Shinji stood in the foyer of the Langley house, dressed in unfamiliar clothes as he prepared to leave for an unfamiliar place, his nerves danced like angry hornets in his stomach. The vaulted ceilings made the room feel open, its walls adorned with oil paintings and the windows framed by vermillion drapes. The floor was smooth and glossy white marble, giving way to the two sets of narrow stairs along each side of the grand corridor, all polished bronze wood that gave the upper balcony a warm glow in the early morning.  
现在八岁的真嗣站在兰格利家的门厅里，穿着不熟悉的衣服，准备前往一个陌生的地方，他的神经像愤怒的黄蜂一样在胃里翻腾。高耸的天花板让房间显得开阔，墙壁上装饰着油画，窗户被朱红色的窗帘框住。地面是光滑的白色大理石，两侧各有两组狭窄的楼梯通向宏伟走廊，所有楼梯都是抛光的青铜木，让上层阳台在清晨时分散发出温暖的辉光。

It wasn't the first time he'd been in the mansion, since he was welcomed in to play the piano with Ilka whenever she came to visit. On rarer occasions, he was allowed full range of the household with Asuka and her mother would give them homemade sweets, which the girl begrudgingly accepted. Asuka usually took most of his too, but he didn't mind, since she never managed to finish all of them and ended up giving him back what would have been his share anyway.  
这并非他首次踏入这座宅邸，每当伊尔卡来访时，他都会受邀前来与她一同弹奏钢琴。偶尔，他还能在明日香和她母亲的允许下自由穿梭于家中，她们会拿出自制的甜点招待他们，尽管明日香对此心不甘情不愿地接受。通常，明日香会吃掉大部分，但他并不介意，因为她总是吃不完，最后还是把本该属于他的那份还给了他。

For most of his stay on the estate, the Langley's had been shadowy figures residing in their grand castle of a house high on the hill, save for the occasional glimpse through a window, or a mention by one of the extra gardeners Gepard hired on. But last October, Asuka had actually taken him into the house to watch the Thanksgiving parades in Berlin on TV, while her mom cooked in the kitchen. Swollen and salted meats, dripping with oils and juices. After seeing the Harvest Queen crowned, the woman brought them into the nearby village, Bernau, so all of the kids could have a lantern parade together.  
在他逗留庄园的大部分时间里，兰利一家就像是高居山丘上宏伟城堡中的幽灵，除了偶尔透过窗户瞥见，或是从格帕德雇佣的园丁口中提及外，几乎不为人知。但去年十月，明日香真的带他进了屋，一起在电视上观看柏林的感恩节游行，而她妈妈则在厨房忙碌。那些腌制得鼓胀的肉块，油光四溢，汁水淋漓。在目睹了收获女王加冕后，那位女士带他们去了附近的伯尔瑙村，让所有孩子一起参加灯笼游行。

She and Asuka didn't smile, barely talked, and in general seemed to agree that neither wanted the other to be there, but also that there was nothing they could do about it. Apparently, her father was almost always away at one of the military bases in Hamburg. Without him there, Asuka took to disobeying her whenever she got the chance.  
她和明日香没有微笑，几乎不交谈，总的来说似乎都同意对方不希望彼此在场，但也无计可施。显然，她的父亲几乎总是在汉堡的某个军事基地。没有他在家，明日香一有机会就对她阳奉阴违。

That night, she told him she didn't care if he never came back.  
那晚，她告诉他，她不在乎他是否再也不回来。

"Dummy! Your tie is loose!" Asuka pinched her fingers at his collar and yanked said tie, nearly choking him. Then she grabbed his jacket and jerked the loose ends together. Taking a step back to inspect a haggard Shinji as he combed a hand through his short hair, she nodded and grabbed her school bag.  
“笨蛋！你的领带松了！”明日香用手指捏住他的衣领，猛地一拉领带，差点让他窒息。然后她抓住他的夹克，用力将松散的部分拉在一起。退后一步，审视着正用手梳理短发的疲惫的真嗣，她点点头，抓起书包。

"Have a good day you two," a voice called from the second floor. Shinji spun to glance Asuka's mother at the top of the steps, a white shawl thrown over her dark azure turtleneck shirt, hanging just a little below her equally dark pants. Her hazelnut hair was caught up in a loose bun and while her expression seemed kind, her eyes were far away.  
"祝你们俩今天过得愉快，"二楼传来一个声音。真嗣转身瞥见明日香的母亲站在台阶顶端，一件白色披肩搭在她深蓝色的高领衫上，略微垂至同样深色的裤子上。她的榛色头发随意挽成一个松散的发髻，尽管表情看似和蔼，眼神却飘忽不定。

Asuka didn't answer, grabbing his arm to tug him along while sending a baleful glare up the stairs. Shinji followed, exiting the grand white marble foyer and climbing into the black car with Asuka. He sat next to her, putting his navy blue bag on the floor alongside her red and black polka dot one. Her uniform was the same color as his, dark gray jacket with a white undershirt. Where he wore plaid shorts, she had a plaid skirt that went almost below her knees, black socks pulled up high. He didn't know what it was, but somehow she seemed... different. Maybe it was the new, long red ribbons holding her pigtails up.
明日香没有回答，而是抓住他的胳膊把他拽了过来，同时向楼上发出了一个 明日香瞪着他走上楼梯。真嗣紧随其后，走出大理石门厅 大理石门厅，和明日香一起爬上了黑色轿车。他坐在明日香旁边 他把自己的海军蓝包放在地上，和明日香的红黑圆点包放在一起。圆点包。她的制服颜色和他的一样，深灰色外套 白色打底衫。他穿的是格子短裤，而她穿的是格子短裙。
裙摆几乎没过膝盖，黑色袜子挽得很高。他 他不知道是什么原因，但不知怎的，她似乎......与众不同。也许是 也许是因为她的小辫子上新绑了一条长长的红丝带。

"You look pretty," he said.

Asuka nodded, touching the crimson bands. "I know."  
明日香点点头，轻触着那鲜红的绷带。“我知道。”

As they left the Langley estate through a long black gate, Shinji sat straight in the leather seats, fidgeting and wringing his hands in his lap. When he noticed Asuka throwing annoyed glances at him, he stilled – at least for a few minutes. The trip out of the rolling countryside didn't take long, the sunny morning turning a little muggier as they reached the city. The constant heat and rains in Berlin, caused by something Teacher called Second Impact, had become the norm on the Langley Estate. To think that there had ever been anything like fall or winter was baffling and if not for the pictures – he would have thought Teacher was making it up.  
当他们穿过长长的黑色大门离开兰格利庄园时，真嗣笔直地坐在皮椅上，不停地扭动着，双手紧握在膝间。注意到明日香投来不悦的目光，他才稍稍安静下来——至少持续了几分钟。驶出连绵起伏的乡村并不久，阳光明媚的早晨随着他们进入城市而变得有些闷热。柏林因所谓的第二次冲击而持续的高温多雨，在兰格利庄园已成为常态。想到这里曾有过秋天或冬天的景象，真让人难以置信，若非有照片为证——他甚至会以为老师是在编造。

Now he was embarking on a journey to the _Evangelisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster_, a prestigious school in Berlin, or so Teacher said. It looked like the Langley house: all rustic red brick guarded by thin trees and caste iron statues, stained green from enduring the tortures of the weather. The main building looked like a cathedral, its rooftops lined with spires decorated in swirling gilded patterns.  
现在，他正启程前往柏林的埃瓦莱茨高级中学，据老师所说，这是一所颇负盛名的学校。它看起来与兰格利庄园颇为相似：都是由红砖砌成的古朴建筑，四周被稀疏的树木和历经风雨侵蚀而锈迹斑斑的铁像守护着。主楼宛如一座大教堂，屋顶上排列着装饰有螺旋金纹的尖塔。

The car squealed to a halt by the open courtyard on the left of the cathedral and Shinji shambled out after Asuka. For a moment, they just stood there – taking it all in, or at least _he_ was. Asuka had been attending regular school for a couple of years now, but he had never seen so many other kids in one place. Teacher had prepared him for the fact that almost none would look like him, though a part of him had already come to understand that ever since he started learning the world map.  
汽车在教堂左侧的开放庭院旁尖叫般地刹住，真嗣跟在明日香后面蹒跚而出。有那么一会儿，他们只是站在那里——感受这一切，至少他是这样。明日香已经上了几年常规学校，但他从未见过这么多孩子聚集在一个地方。老师曾告诉他，几乎没有人会像他那样，尽管自从他开始学习世界地图以来，他的一部分已经理解了这一点。

The trees in the courtyard were skinny compared to the ones in his garden and all around him were old stone and brick structures. The shining glass and rigid metals of the newer buildings were mixed in with them, making the place feel like some disjointed bridge in time.  
庭院里的树木比他花园里的要瘦弱，四周都是古老的石砖建筑。闪亮的玻璃和坚硬的金属构成的新建筑与之混杂，让这个地方感觉像是时光中脱节的桥梁。

"Hurry _up_, Shinji!" “快点，真嗣！”

He jumped at the call, finding Asuka already way across the courtyard. Running to catch up, he followed her up a small flight of steps and into a long building three stories high. The main hall was filled with a thunder of raucous voices, each seemingly clamoring for his ear. A few people, torn from their animated groups, caught sight of him and had to double take.  
他听到呼唤便跳了起来，发现明日香已经远远穿过了庭院。他跑着追上去，跟着她上了一段小台阶，进了一座三层楼高的长形建筑。大厅里充斥着雷鸣般的嘈杂声，每个人的声音似乎都在争抢着他的注意力。有几个从热闹的群体中被拉出来的人，一看到他便不得不多看两眼。

Staggering as someone bumped into him, Shinji realized he'd lost Asuka.  
被人撞了一下，真嗣踉跄着，意识到自己把明日香跟丢了。

"Watch where you're going, stupid!" A chubby boy snarled, stopping as he snared a good look at Shinji, who gulped, stuttering an apology. The other kid and his friends, who were staring at him now, didn't seem to notice his feeble attempts at communication.  
“看着点路，笨蛋！”一个胖乎乎的男孩咆哮道，停下来仔细打量着真嗣，后者咽了口唾沫，结结巴巴地道歉。那孩子和他的朋友们现在正盯着他看，似乎没注意到他微弱的交流尝试。

"He's got funny eyes," one of them said and all at once there were too many faces with wide eyes.  
"他的眼睛真滑稽，"其中一个说道，随即出现了太多睁大眼睛的面孔。

"Why is his nose shaped so goofy?"  
"他的鼻子怎么长得这么怪？"

"Is he from another planet?"  
"他是不是来自另一个星球？"

Shinji backed up, a pudgy hand pushing him, lockers rattling as he smacked into them. "He isn't an alien, idiot. Just some _schlitzauge_," the boy said, spitting it like a curse. "My dad says they're all born on boats now since their island sank."  
真嗣后退了几步，一只胖手推着他，撞到储物柜上发出响声。“他不是外星人，白痴。只是个近视眼，”那男孩说道，语气中带着轻蔑。“我爸说他们现在都出生在船上，因为他们的岛沉了。”

"Hey!" every head turned to look as the small crowd parted, revealing a furious Asuka Langley Soryu. "Get away from him!"  
“嘿！”所有人都转头看去，人群分开，露出愤怒的惣流·明日香·兰格雷。“离他远点！”

The not-so-skinny boy who had pushed him offered a crooked grin, and took a few steps forward. "Why? What's a dumb girl like you gonna' do?"  
那个推他的不瘦男孩咧嘴一笑，向前走了几步。“为什么？你这样的蠢女孩能做什么？”

He was answered with a shoe to his crotch – squealing like a little pig as he collapsed to his knees, tears falling over his red face. Since he was already leaning forward, Asuka planted a foot on his head and pushed his cheek to the floor.  
他得到了一个鞋尖直击胯部的回应——像小猪一样尖叫着跪倒在地，泪水从他通红的脸上滑落。既然他已经前倾，明日香便一脚踩在他的头上，将他的脸颊压向地板。

"If you ever talk to him again – I'll break your stupid face!"  
“如果你再敢跟他说话——我会打烂你那张蠢脸！”

---

Headmistress Bayern's eyebrow twitched, but her regal and commanding aura didn't falter in the slightest. Shinji looked to the floor again, unable to make himself small enough in the oversized chair across from her oak desk. Her dark grey eyes slid gradually to Asuka, who was slouched back in her seat, arms crossed as an annoyed frown pouted her lips. Bayern's nails clacked loudly upon the worn tabletop.  
拜恩校长眉头微皱，但她那威严且不容置疑的气场丝毫未减。真嗣再次看向地板，无法让自己在对面那张宽大的椅子里显得更小。她的深灰色眼睛缓缓转向明日香，后者正懒散地靠在椅背上，双臂交叉，不满地噘着嘴。拜恩的指甲在磨损的桌面上发出响亮的敲击声。

At last, the drumming was replaced by the ringing of a phone just inches away. She plucked it from the receiver and brought it to an ear, eyes not moving from them for a moment. "Headmistress Bayern speaking," she said, pausing for the other end, her tone changing to something a little conversational. "Yes, Mr Langley... well of course not, but it isn't her first incident here at this establishment and we do not tolerate this sort of behavior... I understand, but... as long as it does not continue to be an issue... very well, you've made your point, but I do have to keep up appearances you know... of course, good day."  
终于，鼓声被几英寸外响起的电话铃声所取代。她从座机上拿起电话，贴近耳边，目光一刻也未曾从他们身上移开。“巴伐利亚校长在听，”她说道，停顿等待对方回应，语气变得稍显随意。“是的，兰利先生……当然不是，但这并非她在这所学校第一次惹事，我们不容忍这种行为……我明白，但是……只要不再成为问题……很好，你已经表明了立场，但我必须维持形象，您知道的……当然，祝您有美好的一天。”

The phone was returned to its berth with a little more force than necessary, though Bayern appeared just as collected as she had before. "I'll leave you with a warning this time, young lady," the woman said, briefly pinning Shinji under those sharp eyes. "Please keep your friend out of trouble from now on."  
电话被放回原位，力度稍大了些，尽管巴伐利亚看起来和之前一样镇定。“这次我给你一个警告，小姑娘，”女人说，锐利的目光短暂地钉在真嗣身上。“请从现在开始让你的朋友远离麻烦。”

"I'm sorry," he said. “对不起。”他说。

The Headmistress only hummed, retrieving a pen to start scrawling marks on papers he was too low to see. "You may go," she said without looking up. They were ushered out of the door by another teacher and led back to class. Asuka was walking a few steps ahead of him and he used her heels to navigate while maintaining his downward gaze.  
女校长只是哼了一声，取出一支笔开始在那些他够不着的文件上潦草地做标记。“你可以走了，”她头也不抬地说道。他们被另一位老师领着出了门，带回了教室。明日香走在他的前面几步，他便盯着她的鞋跟来导航，同时保持着低垂的目光。

"What are you sorry for anyway?" she hissed.  
“你到底在道歉什么？”她低声质问。

"Huh?" he looked up to find her peevish eyes on him.  
“啊？”他抬起头，迎上了她恼怒的目光。

She slowed down a little to let him catch up to her, but only to punch him in the arm. "If someone's attacking you, you can't just stand there!"  
她稍微放慢了脚步，让他能跟上，却只是为了朝他手臂打了一拳。“如果有人攻击你，你不能就那样站着！”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

"Ugh, just be quiet!" she growled, walking several paces ahead of him again. The teacher escorting them cast a glare over his shoulder and they descended into quiet. As they passed what must have been a nurses office, Shinji spotted the gelatinous boy from earlier sitting sullenly outside by the door, several yellow bruises coloring his red cheeks. When he looked up and caught sight of Asuka, the boy moved faster than Shinji would have thought possible for a person his size. His eyes bulged and he pressed himself back against the wall, hands grasping the chair desperately.  
“呃，闭嘴！”她咆哮着，再次快步走到他前面。护送他们的老师回头瞪了一眼，他们便安静了下来。当他们经过一间护士办公室时，真嗣看到之前那个软绵绵的男孩沮丧地坐在门外，红扑扑的脸颊上点缀着几块黄色瘀伤。当他抬头看到明日香时，男孩的动作快得让真嗣难以置信，仿佛他那体型也能如此敏捷。他的眼睛瞪得大大的，紧紧贴着墙壁，双手拼命抓住椅子。

Asuka pinned him with scathing eyes and then stomped a foot towards him. The boy yelped and fell out of his chair, cowering against the nurse's door. Asuka smirked as they continued on.  
明日香用锐利的目光盯着他，然后猛地向他踏出一步。男孩惊叫一声，从椅子上摔了下来，蜷缩在护士的门前。明日香得意地笑了笑，继续前行。

Shinji wasn't so sure he wanted to go to school anymore.  
真嗣不太确定自己是否还想继续上学了。

Just about every morning he and Asuka would get up early and attend the _Grauen Kloster_, and every day Shinji ached for something he vaguely remembered as comforting.  
几乎每个早晨，他和明日香都会早起前往格劳恩修道院，而每一天，真嗣都渴望着一种他依稀记得的安慰感。

Not only were teachings at the _Grauen Kloster_ at the forefront of his priorities, but lessons at the Langley estate continued, albeit with far less frequency. Since he now attended school regularly and had to go see Lützow every other day, time had to be set aside for homework and study. He rarely had an opportunity to sit among the fire lilies or gaze at the stars. Asuka he saw in class, but there was no play to be had there. Except for recess, which was a strained affair.  
格劳恩修道院的教学不仅在他的优先事项中占据首位，而且在兰格利庄园的课程也继续进行，尽管频率大大降低。由于他现在定期上学，并且每隔一天就得去见吕措号，他必须留出时间来完成作业和学习。他很少有机会坐在火百合丛中或仰望星空。在课堂上他能看到明日香，但那里没有玩耍的空间。除了课间休息，那也是一件勉强的事情。

When outside, they were minded by a pair of nuns from the school chapel, Sister Cécile and Sister Maria. The former was the senior of the two and a severe woman, who rarely showed more than an exasperated concern beyond her firm demeanor. They stood by the tall oak nearest the fences, dressed in white veils and their black cloaks, watching the children play.  
在外面时，她们由学校小教堂的一对修女——塞西尔修女和玛丽亚修女照看。前者是两人中的年长者，一位严厉的女性，除了坚定的举止外，很少表现出更多的不耐烦的关心。她们站在靠近围栏的高大橡树旁，身着白色面纱和黑色斗篷，注视着孩子们玩耍。

The girls, who intermingled with the boys while in the _Kloster's_ halls, segregated and formed patches of varying hairstyles and hand clapping games, while the boys spent half of it deciding on soccer teams, leaving them little time to actually play. Though the games usually melted down into a fierce reenactment of the Battle of Halbe, anyway. Until yet another argument broke out over who should have to play the Russians.  
女孩们在修道院的走廊里与男孩们混在一起，分开后形成了各种发型和拍手游戏的群体，而男孩们则花了一半时间决定足球队伍，几乎没有时间真正玩耍。尽管游戏通常还是会演变成激烈的哈尔贝战役重现，直到又一次争论爆发，关于谁应该扮演俄罗斯人。

While all this went on, Asuka read from their textbooks, and bored Shinji to tears. His friend was all smiles and pleasantries in class, but out here, might as well have been carved from ice. He'd tried to play with her a few times, but that had basically driven her back to the classroom after a fit of yelling between them. Since then, Shinji might manage, with great reluctance, to get put on a soccer team, and always with the Bavarian kids. They were taunted by the protestants for having come from Catholic families, but at least none of the others tried to chase them off.  
在这期间，明日香从他们的教科书中阅读，让真嗣感到无比无聊。他的朋友在课堂上总是笑容满面、彬彬有礼，但在这里，她简直就像是用冰雕成的。他曾几次试图和她一起玩耍，但那基本上只会让她在他们的争吵后回到教室。从那以后，真嗣可能勉强会加入一个足球队，而且总是和巴伐利亚的孩子们一起。他们因为来自天主教家庭而受到新教徒的嘲笑，但至少其他人没有试图赶走他们。

One group went out of their way to trip or shoulder check him when they played, while some chanted _Japse, Japse!_ from the sidelines. What Asuka said to him on their first day wouldn't leave his mind, and grew louder with every slur. Turned hot under his skin. So the next recess, he tackled one of the sandy-haired boys back. They scraped and pulled in the dirt like a pair of tangled snakes, forcing Sister Maria to come over and break them up.  
有一群人故意在比赛中绊倒或用肩膀撞他，而有些人则在边线上高喊“日本仔，日本仔！”。明日香在他们第一天对他说的话一直萦绕在他的脑海中，随着每一句侮辱而变得更加响亮。他的皮肤下感到一阵灼热。所以在下一个课间休息时，他回击了一个沙色头发的男孩。他们在泥土中扭打，像两条纠缠的蛇，迫使玛丽亚修女过来把他们分开。

The only boys willing to play with him after that were those from the Czech and Austrian classes, of which there were only a handful. One of the boys, Marcel, and his sister were particularly interested in him, but only spoke Croatian. More out of stubbornness than because they couldn't speak German, and Shinji found the Czech's accented dialect too grating to try and talk much. So he wandered off on his own, occasionally convincing Asuka to poke at ant hills with him.  
自那以后，愿意和他一起玩的男孩只剩下捷克班和奥地利班的几个人。其中有个叫马塞尔的男孩和他妹妹对他特别感兴趣，但只会说克罗地亚语。他们并非不会说德语，只是出于固执，而真嗣觉得捷克口音的德语太过刺耳，不愿多谈。于是他常常独自游荡，偶尔说服明日香和他一起戳蚂蚁窝。

Apparently, he was still doing something wrong since at some point, as a rule, Sister Cécile started sending Shinji over with the girls every recess. They didn't seem to mind him all that much, and even asked him about Japan. There weren't many questions he could answer, much to his frustration. More often than not he was simply made to guard the slide from any boys that strayed over, since the girls sat towards the bottom and the boys thought it was funny to ride down and crash into their circles.  
显然，他还是做错了什么，因为不知从何时起，塞西尔修女开始在每次课间休息时让真嗣和女孩们一起玩。她们似乎并不介意他，甚至还问起日本的事情。他回答不上来多少问题，这让他很沮丧。更多时候，他被安排看守滑梯，防止有男孩闯过来，因为女孩们坐在滑梯底部，而男孩们觉得从滑梯上冲下来撞进她们的圈子很有趣。

Asuka watched him from the benches whenever he was with them, fixated, almost threatening. He tried to call her over a few times, but was ignored with a sweep a hair. So he talked to some of the other girls instead, and that was when Asuka started joining their circles, though rarely laid an eye on him after that.  
每当他与她们在一起时，明日香总是从长椅上注视着他，专注得近乎带有威胁。他几次试图叫她过来，却只换来她一甩头发的漠视。于是他转而与其他女孩交谈，也就是从那时起，明日香开始加入她们的圈子，尽管之后很少再正眼看他。

His friend was more fun outside of school and still came by the garden to see him, inviting herself in as she had always done. Teacher no longer tried to fight it. When away from the others she pondered the habits of rats, complained about how annoying all the boys were, babbled about the other girls at school, and generally made it impossible for him to get anything done. Asuka also made a habit of finishing her homework before him, anyway. He never really cared to try and outpace her in that area.  
他的朋友在校外更有趣，依然会来花园看他，像往常一样自顾自地走进来。老师也不再试图阻止。当她独自一人时，她会沉思老鼠的习惯，抱怨所有男孩有多烦人，喋喋不休地谈论学校里的其他女孩，总之让他无法专心做事。明日香也习惯于在他之前完成作业，无论如何，他从未真正在意过要在那方面超越她。

Day by day the gardens called to him, but seemed more like a passing dream. Teacher said he had big responsibilities and that he had to live up to them for his father. He was some sort of pilot like Asuka now. He still didn't understand why she'd been so mad about it, but the girl hadn't mentioned it again. Spending any time with her often turned into a tirade about how he should be paying more attention in class.  
日复一日，花园似乎在呼唤他，却更像是一场转瞬即逝的梦。老师说他肩负重任，必须为父亲而努力。他现在成了某种飞行员，就像明日香那样。他仍不明白她为何对此如此生气，但那女孩再也没提过。与她相处时，常常会变成一场关于他应该在课堂上更加专注的训斥。

Music immediately became one of his favorite sessions at school, if nothing else than because there was practically no homework to be done – except for today. Eight-year-old Shinji lugged a big black case through the garden to his white and bamboo-tan house. As he staggered through the door, Teacher quirked an eyebrow and lowered the open book in his hand, though his expression remained ever stoic. Panting, Shinji set the case down before facing Teacher, pressing his arms to his sides and bowing. "Uh, Herr Hannover wants me to practice at home..."  
音乐课立刻成为他在学校最喜欢的课程之一，如果不是因为几乎没有作业要做的话——除了今天。八岁的真嗣拖着一个大黑箱子穿过花园，走向他那白绿相间的家。当他踉踉跄跄地进门时，老师扬起了一边的眉毛，放下手中的书，尽管表情依旧严肃。喘着气，真嗣把箱子放下，面对老师，双臂紧贴身体鞠了一躬。“呃，汉诺威先生让我在家练习……”

He wasn't sure why, since students were rarely allowed to take instruments with them and only the older kids at that. Hannover had, at the very least, seemed pleased with his ability to play, but all that had done was make more work for him.  
他不明白为什么，因为通常不允许学生携带乐器，而且仅限于高年级学生。至少，汉诺威对他的演奏能力似乎颇为满意，但这只是给他带来了更多的工作。

The man glanced at the cello case, then back to his charge before deciding on more tea and returning to his book. "So long as it does not interfere with your other studies."  
那人瞥了一眼大提琴盒，然后回头看向他的监护对象，决定再喝点茶，继续看书。“只要不妨碍你的其他学业。”

"Thank you," Shinji said, standing straight and retreating to his room with the cello. Clicking the black case open, he checked the polished wood for blemishes and tested the strings for any signs of stress. The cello wasn't Shinji's first choice to play, but after experimenting in Hannover's class as they'd all been made to do, the man was a little more pleased with his handling of the cello and insisted he make it his own.  
“谢谢，”真嗣说道，站直身子，带着大提琴回到自己的房间。他打开黑色的琴盒，检查光滑的木质是否有瑕疵，并测试琴弦是否有任何应力迹象。大提琴并非真嗣的首选，但在汉诺威的课上尝试过后，老师对他的大提琴演奏稍感满意，并坚持让他将其作为自己的乐器。

Setting the case down on the floor, he dragged a chair out from the corner and readied the instrument. The laminated maple wood glowed under the fading light of afternoon creeping in through his window. Careful not to let it fall, he situated himself upright in the chair and adjusted the cello's endpin for his small stature. Reaching back down to the case, he found the bow. It was made from something called brazilwood, horsehair pinched taut down its length. Shifting a few more times to get comfortable, he set his left fingers up on the neck – not looking forward to the red, numb indents he would have soon after.  
他将琴盒放在地上，从角落拖出一把椅子，准备好了乐器。枫木贴面在透过窗户的渐弱午后阳光下闪耀着光泽。他小心翼翼地不让它掉落，笔直地坐在椅子上，调整了小提琴的尾针以适应自己的身材。再次弯腰到琴盒旁，他找到了琴弓。这弓是用一种叫做巴西木的材料制成，马尾毛紧紧地夹在其长度上。他又调整了几次以获得舒适的位置，将左手手指放在琴颈上——并不期待很快就会出现的那种红肿、麻木的印记。

The strings screeched as he drew the bow across. Huffing through his nose, he adjusted the pegs like Hannover showed him. It took a half-hour, but eventually he was able to start playing the right notes and it wasn't long before his arms grew tired and his shoulder blades ached.  
当他拉动琴弓时，琴弦发出了刺耳的声音。他通过鼻子呼气，像汉诺威教他的那样调整了弦轴。花了半个小时，但最终他能够开始演奏正确的音符，不久他的手臂就感到疲倦，肩胛骨也开始疼痛。

Later, as he and Teacher gathered for dinner, Shinji was pouring the sake when his caretaker granted him prolonged eye contact and bowed his head slightly. "Your playing was acceptable, Shinji."  
后来，当他与老师一起用餐时，真嗣正在倒酒，他的看护人长时间地注视着他，微微点头。“你的演奏还可以，真嗣。”

He blinked, staring wide eyed at his Teacher. The man rarely praised him for anything, let alone something so unimportant as music lessons.  
他眨了眨眼，睁大眼睛盯着他的老师。这位先生很少因为任何事情表扬他，更不用说像音乐课这样无关紧要的事了。

Then Teacher sighed. "The sake, Shinji."  
然后老师叹了口气。"清酒，真嗣。"

He looked down and yelped as the liquid spilled over the table. Shinji stuttered an apology while cleaning up, but Teacher seemed far less perturbed as he did so. Maybe practicing with the cello wasn't such a bad thing after all.  
他低头一看，液体洒在桌子上，不禁惊叫一声。真嗣一边清理一边结结巴巴地道歉，但老师似乎对此并不太在意。或许练习大提琴毕竟不是什么坏事。

The weeks and months passed in a blur. School days were long and full of boring readings about wars and people that wore funny helmets thousands of years ago. If asked, he could name all the places Alexander had fought over, but couldn't have said what made him all that great. So what if he conquered lots of stuff? Plenty of other people had done that too. What was so great about that?  
几周和几个月的时间在模糊中流逝。学校的日子漫长而充满了关于几千年前戴着滑稽头盔的战争和人物的无聊阅读。如果被问到，他可以列举出亚历山大所有战斗过的地方，但说不出他到底有多伟大。就算他征服了很多地方又怎样？还有很多人也做到了。这有什么了不起的？

"That's not the point," Asuka said, having taken him on as something of an idol. "He was remembered for thousands of years!"  
“那不是重点，”明日香说，她把他当作某种偶像。“他被记住了几千年！”

_But he died and everything he built fell apart_. Shinji added, though only in his head.  
但他死了，他所建立的一切都分崩离析了。真嗣在心里补充道。

Just like with Alexander, neither could he reason what made Pyrrhus or Hannibal Barca so celebrated in these long, brain-melting history lessons. With all the homework they were given, he didn't have much time to study for the actual tests anyway. On nights that he _would_ have the time, Asuka just leaned over his shoulder to badger him until he went to bed and Teacher shooed her out the door. Sometimes Asuka sprawled on the floor and whined that she was hungry, doing this day after day until finally demanding that he prepare food for her.  
就像对待亚历山大一样，他无法理解皮洛士或汉尼拔·巴卡在这些漫长且令人脑力衰竭的历史课上为何如此著名。尽管他们有大量的家庭作业，他实际上也没有太多时间来准备真正的考试。在那些他本该有时间的日子里，明日香只是靠在他的肩膀上纠缠他，直到他上床睡觉，而老师则把她赶出门外。有时明日香会摊开四肢躺在地板上，抱怨她饿了，日复一日地这样做，直到最后要求他为她准备食物。

From then on, Shinji took the hint for what it was, and cooked with the limited ingredients that were kept stocked. Teacher prepared dishes that invariably involved fish or something fried. Asuka would wolf everything down while complaining about how weird the Japanese must be. Shinji wouldn't know, and found on most occasions he preferred onion cake or pot roast anyway.

Teacher didn't approve of the girl's blatant disregard for Japanese custom, but there was little he could do considering her father was already allowing them to stay on his estate, and she knew it too. Shinji hadn't realized until recently how important her father was, or rather, he understood lots of people knew him and he had a big house. That and the fact that Asuka had beaten up another boy and gotten off with little more than a warning from the Headmistress.  
老师对女孩公然无视日本习俗的行为并不赞同，但考虑到她的父亲已经允许他们在他的庄园里居住，而且她自己也清楚这一点，老师也无可奈何。真嗣直到最近才意识到她的父亲有多重要，或者说，他知道很多人认识她的父亲，并且他拥有一座大房子。还有就是，明日香打伤了另一个男孩，却只从校长那里得到了一个轻微的警告。

Shinji wasn't sure if any of the teachers there actually liked him, but they at least acknowledged him with a nod and a smile. If he failed to return as much, they always insisted. Their greetings felt condescending, but they treated the other kids that way too. Well, most of them. Asuka was one of the students they always doted on. Shinji couldn't help but be a little jealous of her for it. She lived in a huge garden with a nice dad and a mom that made her sweets and cakes. No one called her names at school or gave her dirty looks and she had lots of friends. She could practically get away with _murder_ if she wanted.  
真嗣不确定那里的老师们是否真的喜欢他，但他们至少会对他点头微笑。如果他没有回应，他们总是坚持要他这样做。他们的问候让人感觉有些居高临下，但他们对其他孩子也是如此。嗯，大多数孩子。明日香是他们总是宠爱的学生之一。真嗣不禁有点嫉妒她。她住在一个巨大的花园里，有一个好爸爸和一个会给她做甜点和蛋糕的妈妈。在学校里没有人叫她名字或给她白眼，她有很多朋友。如果她愿意，她几乎可以逃脱任何惩罚。

He couldn't get away with anything.  
他什么也逃不掉。

Shinji was arriving home in the afternoon, as usual – but what was not usual was Asuka. As he passed down the brick path around her austere house, he saw her standing at the bottom of the steps leading up to the front door, staring at the stained glass and dark amber wood.  
真嗣像往常一样下午回家，但不同寻常的是明日香。当他沿着她家严肃的房子周围的砖砌小路走时，他看到她站在通往前门的台阶底部，凝视着那扇带有彩色玻璃和深琥珀色木头的门。

"Hey, Asuka." “嘿，明日香。”

Her shoulders jumped and she turned, far-off expression falling away in favor of the more alive and agitated one he was used to. "_What_?"  
她的肩膀一抖，转过身来，原本遥远的表情被他熟悉的更加生动和激动的表情所取代。"怎么了？"

He peered past her, trying to figure out what she had found so interesting on the door, asking, "Are you going somewhere?" why else would she be waiting out front?  
他越过她望去，试图弄清楚她对门上的什么东西如此感兴趣，问道："你要去哪儿吗？"不然她为什么会在前门等着？

"Your house, _dummy_ – why'd you get home so late?" Asuka asked, pushing him with one hand as she walked up next to him, just because she could.  
"你家啊，傻瓜——怎么这么晚才回来？" 明日香一边问，一边用一只手推他，她走到他旁边，只是因为她可以这样做。

"I always get here like this," he said, staying balanced with practiced ease.  
"我总是这样到家的，" 他回答，轻松地保持平衡。

Recycled air cooled his brow as they entered his small house. He and Asuka greeted Teacher, who offered little more than a tilt of an eyebrow as they passed. Closing the door to his room, Shinji set his backpack down by his desk and started to make himself comfortable. When he sat down and Asuka didn't leave, a twinge of annoyance struck him. "I have lots of homework to do, you know."  
他们进入他狭小的房子时，循环的空气让他的额头感到凉爽。他和明日香向老师打招呼，老师只是微微抬了抬眉毛作为回应。关上房门，真嗣把书包放在书桌旁，开始让自己放松下来。当他坐下而明日香没有离开时，一丝不悦掠过他的心头。"我知道我有很多作业要做。"

"You always do," she sighed, collapsing on his bed. "How's it take you so long to finish?"  
"你总是这样，"她叹了口气，瘫倒在他的床上。"你怎么总是要这么久才能完成？"

His shoulders tensed. "It just... _does_."  
他的肩膀紧绷起来。"就是……需要时间。"

She only grunted, staring up at the ceiling. Pressure sat over his ribcage when she stayed quiet, the weight of it pressing uncomfortably. All the same he was surprised she was even here. Not because her being in his room was weird – she came in whenever she wanted – but she'd been appearing less and less lately. She looked sullen at school, didn't talk to anyone beyond plastered smiles and expected manners. He'd seen her handful of _real_ smiles, and knew when she was faking.  
她只是咕哝了一声，盯着天花板。她沉默时，他的胸腔感到一种压迫，那种重量让人不适。尽管如此，他对她出现在这里还是感到惊讶。不是因为她进他房间有什么奇怪的——她想进就进——而是她最近出现的次数越来越少了。她在学校看起来闷闷不乐，除了敷衍的微笑和应有的礼貌外，几乎不和任何人说话。他见过她几次真心的笑容，知道她何时在假装。

Shinji turned back to his homework, taking out the SDAT that rarely left his person and poking the buds in his ears. He risked another glance at Asuka, her back facing him.  
真嗣转回去做作业，拿出那台几乎不离身的 SDAT，将耳机塞入耳中。他冒险又瞥了一眼明日香，她背对着他。

It wasn't fair. What made her the "Pride and Joy of Germany" as all of their teachers said? It started as a bit of a joke – look at little Asuka, such a good student, so wonderful of her to be so kind to that delinquent eastern boy. Then she began to blaze through the mock tests – scoring even higher on the actual papers, imbuing their praise with truth. "Look at little Asuka," they would say, "she has such potential. She's sure to do great things one day!"  
这不公平。凭什么她被所有老师称为“德国的骄傲与荣耀”？起初这只是个玩笑——看看小明日香，成绩那么好，对那个东方的坏小子如此友善，真是太棒了。然后她开始在模拟考试中大放异彩——甚至在正式试卷上得分更高，让他们的赞誉变得名副其实。“看看小明日香，”他们会说，“她有这么大的潜力。将来一定能成就一番大事！”

She basked in it too, and for a while it was like he didn't exist. Like he faded away. Sometimes, on the way back to the estate, she'd ask him lots of questions she knew he didn't have the answers to, gloating that knowledge over him. He wanted to shove her and tell her to go away.  
她也沉浸其中，有一段时间，他仿佛不存在了。就像他消失了一样。有时，在回庄园的路上，她会问他许多她明知他答不上来的问题，得意地向他炫耀那些知识。他真想推开她，叫她走开。

The hours dragged by and Shinji barely made a dent in studies. He wished Asuka was awake – and not acting stranger than usual, maybe then she would pester him about his homework and help him solve some of the problems. Well, she never really helped him so much as she forced him to redo the work every time he got an answer wrong, _without_ telling him how to solve it. At the thought, he checked the clock sitting at his desk: a circular black frame with a mouse for the small hand and a cat for the big one.  
时间一分一秒地过去，真嗣的学习进度几乎停滞不前。他希望明日香能醒来——而且不要表现得比平时更奇怪，也许那样她会催促他做作业，并帮他解决一些难题。不过，她其实并没有真正帮助他，每次他答错时，她只是逼他重做，却不告诉他解题方法。想到这里，他看了一眼桌上的时钟：一个圆形的黑色边框，时针是一只老鼠，分针是一只猫。

"It's really dark," he said, twisting to where she was lying in bed, "won't your mom worry?"  
“这里真的很暗，”他转头对躺在床上的她说，“你妈妈不会担心吗？”

The girl didn't even stir, her back rising and falling gently. Should he wake her? Maybe not, she had been especially moody today and the day before. He stood, edging up to his bed where he could see her face a little, free of all the usual expressions she made.  
女孩连动都没动，背部轻轻地起伏着。他该叫醒她吗？也许不必，她今天和昨天都特别情绪化。他站起身，慢慢靠近自己的床，以便能看清她的脸，没有她平时那些表情。

After a few quiet moments, he brushed his teeth and flossed, still finding Asuka fast asleep when he returned. Hesitation plucking at him for another drawn out second, he fished out an extra pillow and blanket from his closet before turning off the light, and resigning himself to sleeping on the floor.  
几分钟后，他静静地刷了牙并用牙线清理，回来时发现明日香依然熟睡。犹豫再次拉扯着他，他又花了些时间，从衣橱里拿出一个额外的枕头和毯子，然后关上灯，无奈地决定睡在地板上。

_The winds were calm and cool, whisking away the sting of the sun from his skin. Someone spoke to him, but he was too busy trying to catch the glow bug. He was so close. It was sitting on a leaf, completely unaware of his presence. His hands reached out, ready to entrap it–  
风轻柔而凉爽，带走了阳光刺痛他皮肤的灼热感。有人对他说话，但他正忙着捕捉萤火虫。他离得很近了。那只萤火虫停在一片叶子上，完全没有意识到他的存在。他的手伸出去，准备捕捉它——_

Something soft yet deliberate pushed into his cheek. The shadowed world of his dreams faded and he felt himself roll over. The thing poked him in the back and he swiped at it with a grumble, bundling up in the sheets and rolling against the wall.  
有什么柔软却又有意地推了他的脸颊一下。梦境中的阴影世界逐渐消退，他感到自己翻了个身。那东西又戳了戳他的背，他咕哝着挥手驱赶，裹紧被子，滚向墙壁。

There was a jab of pain in his left eye and he howled, the world opening in a blur as his head snapped back – cracking into the wall.  
他的左眼突然一阵刺痛，他嚎叫起来，世界在模糊中展开，他的头猛地向后一仰——撞到了墙上。

"OW!" Shinji scrambled up, struggling as he tore out of the tangle of sheets and braced himself in the corner. His vision was spinning and the back of his head – which he grabbed in his hands to make the throbbing stop – stung as if hit with a boulder. At the other end of his bed, closest to the door, Asuka was rolling with laughter.  
“哎哟！”真嗣挣扎着爬起来，从乱糟糟的床单中挣脱出来，蜷缩在角落里。他的视线在旋转，后脑勺——他用手紧紧抓住以减轻疼痛——像被巨石击中一样刺痛。在他的床的另一头，靠近门的地方，明日香正笑得前仰后合。

"It's not funny!" he shouted. This didn't discourage Asuka's mirth in the slightest. Shinji ended up sulking in the corner, rubbing the remnants of sleep from his eyes as her laughter died down to gasps for air and brief giggles.  
“这不好笑！”他喊道。但这丝毫没有减弱明日香的兴致。真嗣最终在角落里闷闷不乐，揉着眼睛里残留的睡意，而她的笑声逐渐减弱为喘息和短暂的咯咯笑。

"Why'd you wake me up, anyway?" he asked. For that matter, when had he gotten into bed? The last thing he remembered was falling asleep on the floor.  
"“你干嘛把我叫醒？”他问道。话说回来，他是什么时候上床的？他最后记得的是自己在地板上睡着了。”

She sat up, crossing her legs. "You sleep too long and it's not rainy out today," she said. Ah, that explained it. If it was sunny out, that meant play in the gardens. Now that he thought of it, today was Sunday – which meant no school. Asuka pushed off his bed, still dressed in her uniform, though the jacket had been discarded and the shirt untucked from her skirt.  
"她盘腿坐起来，“你睡得太久了，而且今天外面没下雨。”她说。啊，这就解释了。如果是晴天，那就意味着可以在花园里玩耍。现在他想到，今天是星期天——这意味着不用上学。明日香从他的床上起身，仍然穿着她的制服，尽管外套已经脱掉，衬衫也从裙子里扯了出来。”

Shinji yawned, glancing down at his white T and blue shorts. He should bathe – Teacher said lapses in hygiene were unacceptable. But Asuka was already on her way out of his room and he didn't want to be left behind. He scrambled out of bed, almost forgetting to close his door.  
"真嗣打了个哈欠，低头看了看自己的白色 T 恤和蓝色短裤。他应该洗澡——老师说过卫生习惯的疏忽是不可接受的。但明日香已经朝他的房间外走去，他不想被落下。他匆忙从床上爬起来，差点忘了关上门。”

Teacher was at his post in the living room by the table. He seemed to disapprove, but that was normal, and didn't say a word as Shinji followed Asuka out the door.  
老师已经在客厅的桌子旁就位。他似乎不太赞同，但这是常态，当真嗣跟着明日香出门时，他一言未发。

It was sweltering the moment they stepped outside, a blast of scorching heat rolling over him and drawing sweat. Heedless, Asuka led the way into the gardens and the shade of the trees. Yet, even under their tall branches, the humidity was staggering, making every breath a labor. Meanwhile, he strategized how he would go about avoiding any wrestling matches with Asuka for the day.  
一踏出室外，酷热便扑面而来，滚滚热浪让他汗流浃背。明日香不顾一切地领路走向花园和树荫下。然而，即便在高大树冠的遮蔽下，湿度依然惊人，每一次呼吸都显得费力。与此同时，他盘算着如何避免今天与明日香发生任何摔跤比赛。

They wound their way to the higher part of the garden where the rose bushes were, stone pathways and marble pillars breaking between them. Under the glare of the sun the white buds became vibrant orbs too blinding to look at, while the reds turned a blazing crimson.  
他们蜿蜒前行至花园地势较高的地方，那里种着玫瑰丛，石板小径和白色大理石柱穿插其间。在阳光的照射下，白色的花苞变成了刺眼的光球，而红色的则变得如火般鲜红。

The single Amaranthus, as Shinji had come to know it, stood proud with its soft purple spires hanging amidst their crucible of thorns. In the middle of the rose garden was the fountain he'd found Asuka at once: an open square pool where the teal water splashed down from huge bowls held high on the wings of robed angels. Asuka sat down on the edge to dip her legs in.  
那株单一的苋菜，正如真嗣所熟知的那样，骄傲地矗立着，柔软的紫色穗子悬挂在它们那布满刺的熔炉之中。在玫瑰园的中央，是他曾找到明日香的那个喷泉：一个开放的方形水池，青绿色的水从披着长袍的天使翅膀上高高托起的大碗中倾泻而下。明日香坐在池边，将双腿浸入水中。

Practically falling down onto his stomach, Shinji dunked his arms in as well, letting his fingers revel in the cool sensation before splashing some over his head. He watched Asuka's legs make circular patterns in the water, his thoughts slipping into the bubbling of the fountain and the humming wails of cicada bugs. He watched her out of the corner of his eye, expression dull as she stared up at her house beyond the trees.  
几乎是跌倒在地的真嗣，也将双臂浸入水中，让手指在清凉的感觉中尽情享受，然后舀起一些水泼在头上。他看着明日香的双腿在水面上划出圆圈，思绪随着喷泉的汩汩声和蝉鸣的嗡嗡声飘散。他斜眼看着她，表情呆滞，目光越过树丛凝视着她家。

"So, we're secret pilots, right?" Shinji asked.  
“所以，我们是秘密驾驶员，对吧？”真嗣问道。

"Uh-huh." "嗯嗯。"

He half-grimaced. "Have they told you what we have to pilot?"  
他半带苦笑地说：“他们告诉你我们要驾驶的是什么了吗？”

"No," she said with a shrug, "my papa says they're still building it."  
“没有，”她耸耸肩回答，“我爸爸说他们还在建造中。”

Shinji made a thoughtful noise, easing onto his back and folding his hands behind his head. The sky was bright and burning, the piercing yet distant cry of a hawk reaching them. Asuka wiggled her toes.  
真嗣发出一声沉思的哼声，缓缓躺下，双手枕在脑后。天空明亮而炽热，一只鹰的尖锐啼鸣虽远犹清晰。明日香动了动脚趾。

"Shinji?" "真嗣？"

"Hm?" he grunted, her tone snagging his attention. He saw her head dip to one side, examining her feet like they were the most new and interesting things in the world.  
"嗯？" 他咕哝了一声，她的语气引起了他的注意。他看到她的头偏向一侧，像是在审视自己的双脚，仿佛它们是世界上最新鲜、最有趣的东西。

"I don't really want to go home today."  
"我今天不太想回家。"

His head quirked. "Why?" 他歪了歪头。"为什么？"

She didn't answer, jerking her head to move hair from her face and sliding some of it behind an ear.  
她没有回答，猛地甩头将头发从脸上拨开，顺手撩到耳后。

"Asuka?" a woman entered the rose garden from another path, yellow and white sundress swaying about her like flowing mists, both a floppy wide-rimmed summer hat and sun glasses shielding her from the bright morning rays. Shinji had met Asuka's mom plenty of times now and she'd been nothing but kind to him, if not a little dismissive. But all adults were like that.  
"明日香？"一位女士从另一条小径步入玫瑰园，身着黄白相间的太阳裙，裙摆如流动的雾气般摇曳，宽边软帽和太阳镜为她遮挡了明媚的晨光。真嗣已经多次见过明日香的妈妈，她对他总是很和善，尽管有时显得有些疏离。但所有成年人都是这样。

"There you are," she sighed, "your father has been worried about you." phone in one hand, she started tapping the screen.  
"你在这儿啊，"她叹了口气，"你爸爸一直在担心你。"她一手拿着手机，开始点击屏幕。

"I don't care," Asuka said.  
"我不在乎，"明日香说。

The woman didn't respond, either not hearing the girl or not listening. After making a few final taps, she held out her free hand and turned half way. "Come now, say goodbye to Shinji."  
女人没有回应，可能是没听见女孩的话，或者根本没在听。她又敲了几下，然后伸出空着的那只手，转过身来一半。"来吧，跟真嗣道个别。"

"Why should I?" Asuka snarled, making Shinji wish he could shrink and disappear. He wanted to tell her this seemed like a bad idea, but his friend sounded on the border of a temper tantrum, and he definitely didn't want to be around for that.  
"我为什么要这么做？"明日香咆哮道，这让真嗣恨不得自己能缩起来消失。他想告诉她这似乎是个馊主意，但他的朋友听起来已经濒临发脾气，他绝对不想待在那里承受。

Her mom touched the top of her sun glasses, lowering them down her nose to reveal a pair of orange-brown eyes that made him feel smaller than an ant. "Because I said so, young lady. Your father will be very upset if I have to tell him you gave me trouble. Is that what you want?"  
她妈妈轻触太阳镜的顶部，将其从鼻梁上拉下，露出一双橙棕色的眼睛，让他感觉自己渺小如蚁。“因为我这么说了，小姑娘。如果你让我为难，你爸爸会很生气的。你希望那样吗？”

Asuka's expression hardened, defeat and resentment passing through her eyes all at once. The girl turned to pull him into a one-armed hug, releasing him just as abruptly before running up to her mom. She started to walk past the woman on their way to the mansion, ignoring the hand she offered.  
明日香的神情变得坚硬，挫败与怨恨同时掠过她的眼眸。女孩转身将他拉入一个单臂拥抱，随即同样突然地放开他，跑向她妈妈。她开始从女人身边走过，朝庄园走去，无视了对方伸出的手。

"Bye, Asuka!" he called, trying to smile when she sent him a fleeting glance back.  
“再见，明日香！”他喊道，努力在她匆匆一瞥时露出微笑。

"This is unacceptable," Teacher said, setting down the paper with his collection of excellent grades. Well, all except the awful red pair of sixes. _Insufficient_.  
“这无法接受，”老师说道，放下那张满是优秀成绩的试卷，唯独那对刺眼的红色六分显得格格不入。“不合格。”

Shinji winced, head dipping further. "I'm sorry."  
真嗣畏缩了一下，头埋得更低。“对不起。”

Teacher's stern expression seemed pronounced somehow, touched with disappointment as he held him under dark eyes for a long minute. They sat opposite one another at the living room table, Shinji's hands balled in his lap.  
老师严肃的表情似乎更加明显，带着失望的神色，他用深邃的目光审视了他良久。他们相对而坐在客厅的桌子旁，真嗣的双手紧握在膝上。

"I had hoped spending more time with the Soryu girl might teach you some discipline towards your studies...but it seems I was mistaken," Teacher went on, and Shinji resisted the urge to say 'I'm sorry' again. "Your afternoon recess will be suspended until your scores improve."  
"我本以为多花些时间和 Soryu 家的女孩相处，或许能让你在学习上有所自律...但看来我错了，"老师继续说道，而真嗣强忍着再次说'对不起'的冲动。"你的下午休息时间将被暂停，直到你的成绩有所提高。"

Shinji's head shot up, mouth opening halfway as a protest fought to leave his lips, only for them close in the same moment. He looked to the floor again. "Yes, Teacher."  
真嗣猛地抬起头，嘴巴半张，抗议的话几乎要脱口而出，却在同一瞬间又闭上了。他再次看向地板。"是的，老师。"

"You may study until bed time," Teacher said, dismissing him.  
"你可以学习到就寝时间，"老师说完，便让他离开了。"

Shinji stomped into his room, where Asuka was lounging on his bed reading some book. His exasperation faded some.  
真嗣气冲冲地走进自己的房间，只见明日香正懒洋洋地躺在他的床上读着一本书。他的恼怒稍稍平息了一些。

"What's that?" he asked, sitting down by his low table.  
“那是什么？”他问道，坐在矮桌旁。

"Just a bunch of made up stories. There's only one that I really like." she closed it and sat up – expression brightening. He'd only gotten home from school half an hour ago and since she was dressed in a T and shorts, she'd probably been home a little longer than he. The perks of getting all ones and twos, instead of an ugly pair of sixes mixed in.  
“只是一些虚构的故事。只有一篇我特别喜欢。”她合上书，坐起身来——表情变得明朗。他刚从学校回来不过半小时，而她穿着 T 恤和短裤，可能比他早到家一些。全是一二分的成绩，而不是混杂着难看的六分，这就是好处。

Asuka sat down at the table with him, using an elbow to prop her cheek up on a fist. "Wanna' play cards or somethin'?"  
明日香和他一起坐在桌旁，用手肘撑着脸颊，握拳托腮。“想玩牌吗？”

For a moment, Shinji considered it. The game they played, _Schnapsen_, was one of the things he could really beat her at. Usually, if he was on a winning streak, they wouldn't stop playing until Asuka managed to beat him at least once. Remembering how long those games tended to last, he took in the stack of books before him and frowned. "Teacher said I can't play until I get better grades. I've been trying really hard, though..."  
有那么一会儿，真嗣考虑了一下。他们玩的斯纳普森牌是他真正能赢她的游戏之一。通常，如果他处于连胜状态，他们就不会停下来，直到明日香至少赢他一次。想起这些游戏往往持续很久，他看着面前的一堆书，皱起了眉头。“老师说我成绩提高之前不能玩。虽然我一直很努力……”

She shrugged. "Maybe you're not studying enough."  
她耸了耸肩。“也许你学得还不够。”

"But I am!" he wailed, crossing his arms on the table and resting his head atop them. "I can't always be as smart as you. It's not fair."  
"可我就是啊！" 他哀叹道，双臂交叉放在桌上，头枕在上面。"我不可能总是像你那么聪明。这不公平。"

Seven-year-old Asuka was unimpressed. "Whining about it won't do anything."  
七岁的明日香对此不以为然。"抱怨是没用的。"

Shinji just sighed. She _would_ say something like that. He was frustrated and tired and he hated all of this stupid work, so of course all she did was belittle him for it. Sometimes he didn't even know why he wanted her around. What was wrong with her anyway?  
真嗣只是叹了口气。她肯定会这么说。他感到沮丧和疲惫，讨厌这些愚蠢的工作，而她却只会因此贬低他。有时候他甚至不知道自己为什么希望她在身边。她到底怎么了？

He turned his head away. "I'm so sick of this... I wanna' go home..."  
他别过头去。“我真是受够了……我想回家……”

"Quit being such a baby," she sneered, flicking his arm.  
“别这么孩子气，”她嘲讽道，轻弹了一下他的手臂。

His brow scrunched. She _knew_ how much that bothered him. "Of course you can say that!" he snapped, "you still have a mom and dad!"  
他皱起眉头。她知道这让他有多恼火。“你当然能这么说！”他厉声道，“你还有爸爸妈妈！”

Asuka was on her feet in an instant, fists tight at her sides. "She's not my mom – she's my step-mom, idiot!" she shouted, seeming to wither in the same moment. "My real mom..." fury gripped her features just as quickly as it had left, anger from those ice blue eyes stinging him cold. "If you wanna' go home so bad, then go!" she cried, running from his room, the rocks outside clattering from her haste to reach the house on the hill.  
明日香立刻站起身来，双拳紧握在身侧。“她不是我妈妈——她是我继母，笨蛋！”她喊道，仿佛在同一瞬间萎缩了。“我真正的妈妈……”愤怒迅速抓住了她的面容，就像它迅速消失一样，那双冰蓝色眼睛中的怒火冷冷地刺痛了他。“如果你这么想回家，那就走吧！”她哭喊着，从他的房间跑出去，外面的石子因她急于奔向山丘上的房子而哗啦作响。

He leaned back against his desk, trying to figure out what had just happened. Step-mom? Where was her real mom? For a second he saw something on Asuka's face he never wanted to see again. Had he just made her cry? No, that was impossible. Asuka never cried. Not when she cut up her legs or fell or if he was too rough when they were wrestling. Not even when Tank had gone away.  
他靠在书桌上，试图弄清楚刚刚发生了什么。继母？她的亲生妈妈在哪里？有那么一瞬间，他在明日香脸上看到了他再也不想看到的东西。难道他刚刚让她哭了？不，那是不可能的。明日香从不哭泣。无论是她割伤了腿，摔倒了，还是他们在摔跤时他太粗鲁。甚至当坦克离开时，她也没有哭。

Shinji let out a growl that turned into a whimper, throwing himself to the floor. When it started to hurt his eyes staring at the light bulb on the ceiling, his view sidled to his bed, finding the book Asuka had been reading. Grimacing, he crawled over and picked it up, pulling on the bookmark tassel. _Prometheus?_ He wondered, looking to where the girl had stormed out.  
真嗣发出一声咆哮，随即变成了呜咽，猛地扑倒在地上。当盯着天花板上的灯泡开始让他的眼睛感到疼痛时，他的视线转向了床，发现了明日香正在读的那本书。他皱着眉头爬过去，拿起书，拉了拉书签的流苏。普罗米修斯？他疑惑地想着，目光投向女孩冲出去的方向。

Maybe he could fix this. It would be a good excuse to find her and apologize. If he kept this up, Asuka would leave him for good. Just the thought of it made his chest swell like a balloon ready to burst. In the meantime, he waited and tried to do something with the pile of books at his desk.  
也许他能解决这个问题。这将是找到她并道歉的一个好借口。如果他继续这样下去，明日香会永远离开他。光是想到这一点，他的胸口就像一个即将爆炸的气球一样膨胀。与此同时，他等待着，试图处理桌子上的一堆书。

---

Later that night, when he was sure Teacher would be asleep, Shinji crept out of his room. He was quiet as a ghost, sliding the front door open and closed without a sound. It wasn't the first time he'd ever snuck out at night, although on both occasions prior it had been in Asuka's company.  
那天深夜，当他确信老师已经睡着时，真嗣悄悄地离开了他的房间。他像幽灵一样安静，悄无声息地打开并关上前门。这不是他第一次在夜间偷偷溜出去，尽管前两次都是和明日香一起。

The crickets chirped while a family of frogs croaked in shrill voices, the moonlight guiding him through the dark forest. He reached the back porch of the mansion and suddenly felt very stupid, since he hadn't actually planned out what he was going to do beyond this point. How was he supposed to sneak inside and give Asuka her book? It was way past even Teacher's bed time and everyone else was likely asleep too. He couldn't imagine sneaking in to wake her up would be well received by Herr Langley. Shinji peered up at the house for a time, remembering which room was Asuka's, up by the top left window.  
蟋蟀在鸣叫，一群青蛙用尖锐的声音呱呱叫着，月光引导他穿过黑暗的森林。他到达了庄园的后门廊，突然觉得自己很愚蠢，因为他并没有实际计划过超过这一点的事情。他怎么才能偷偷进去把书给明日香呢？现在已经过了连老师都睡觉的时间，其他人可能也都睡着了。他无法想象偷偷进去叫醒她会受到兰格先生的欢迎。真嗣抬头看了一会儿房子，回忆起明日香的房间，就在左上角的窗户那里。

Maybe if he could hit it with a pebble or two, she'd wake up, come down and he could give her the book while apologizing at the same time, and then everything would be alright. It was the perfect plan. He crouched, searching the ground for a suitable rock. It had to be a small one, or else he might break the window and then he would _really_ be in trouble.  
也许他要是能用一两颗小石子砸中她，她就会醒过来，下楼来，他就可以一边道歉一边把书给她，然后一切都会好起来的。这是个完美的计划。他蹲下身，在地上寻找合适的石头。得是小一点的，不然可能会打破窗户，那样他就真的麻烦大了。

His fingers roughed up against a pebble and as he seized it, his brow furrowed. What was he doing here? This wasn't going to work. There would be harsh consequences if Teacher ever discovered he had snuck out. Besides... it wasn't like Asuka would want to forgive him. Why should he always have to say he was sorry anyway? Wasn't she the one who said he apologized too much? How was he supposed to know about...  
他的手指触碰到一颗小石子，当他抓住它时，眉头紧皱。他在这里做什么？这行不通的。如果老师发现他偷偷溜出来，会有严重的后果。而且...明菜也不一定会原谅他。为什么他总是得说对不起呢？她不是说过他道歉太多了吗？他怎么知道...

Sighing as he tossed the pebble back to the ground, he froze when he noticed a girl sitting on the steps to the back door, the ethereal light of the moon giving her red hair something of a glow. She had her legs drawn up to her chest, chin resting on her knees.  
叹了口气，他把石子扔回地上，却突然注意到后门台阶上坐着一个女孩，月光洒在她红色的头发上，仿佛散发着微光。她把腿蜷缩到胸前，下巴靠在膝盖上。

Shinji opened his mouth, but the words caught in his throat, so for a while he just stood there, trying to think of what to say. When Asuka didn't yell at him or give him a dirty look, he decided it was safe to walk over and sit down on the steps too. She didn't react and Shinji desperately tried to think of how to fix things now that he was here, gazing up at a night sky streaked with wispy clouds. _The book! That's right..._  
真嗣张开了嘴，但话却卡在了喉咙里，于是他只好站在那里，努力想着该说什么。当明日香没有对他大吼或投来厌恶的目光时，他觉得可以安全地走过去，也坐在台阶上。她没有任何反应，真嗣拼命地思考着现在该如何补救，他抬头望着夜空中飘着缕缕云丝。书！对了……

"You, uh, left this," he said, holding it out to her. Asuka took the book lethargically, not even giving it so much as a glance.  
“你，呃，把这个落下了，”他说着，把书递给她。明日香无精打采地接过书，连看都没看一眼。

"I really miss her," she said, whisper of a voice tugging at his heart. He stared at the ground, listening to the cicadas chirp.  
“我真的好想她，”她轻声说道，那微弱的声音牵动着他的心。他凝视着地面，听着蝉鸣。

"What about your dad?" he asked, waiting for her to shout, but Asuka only folded tighter. He remembered being like that. How could it be the same? He didn't always understand what she said, since she never really talked about that stuff with him. Always asking questions and demanding answers, yet keeping to herself. Maybe her dad wasn't as nice as he used to think. Maybe her dad was like his.  
"你爸爸呢？" 他问道，等待她大喊，但明日香只是更紧地蜷缩起来。他记得自己也曾那样。怎么可能一样呢？他并不总能理解她的话，因为她从未真正和他谈过那些事。总是提问并要求答案，却又自我封闭。也许她爸爸并不像他曾经以为的那么好。也许她爸爸就像他的爸爸一样。

"I... I don't... uh, my mom is... she's..." he stopped, a lump of burning coal rising in his throat. His shoulders sagged and he wanted nothing more than to dash back home and curl up under the sheets with his SDAT. A cool breeze swept through the trees, kissing his warm cheeks and reminding him of the dream with the woman in shadow. Chimes sang further off in the garden.  
"我... 我不... 呃，我妈妈她... 她..." 他停了下来，喉咙里涌上一团灼热的煤块。他的肩膀垂下，只想立刻跑回家，蜷缩在被窝里，抱着他的 SDAT。一阵凉风穿过树林，轻吻着他温热的脸颊，让他想起了那个有阴影中女人的梦。远处花园里，风铃在歌唱。

"A-Asuka?" "A-明日香？"

The girl didn't say anything, the seconds stretching into minutes. It felt like those other dreams he had: floating in a vast and endless ocean, so terribly frightened of the creeping dark.  
女孩没有说话，时间一分一秒地拉长。这感觉就像他其他的梦：漂浮在无边无际的海洋中，对那渐渐逼近的黑暗感到无比恐惧。

He licked his lips. "My... the, the letter my dad sent... I have to, stay for another five years or, or something so..."  
他舔了舔嘴唇。“我...我爸寄来的信...我得，再待五年或者，或者别的什么...”

"Shut up," she snapped, standing and stunning him with the scathing look that passed over her face. As he opened his mouth, she seemed to decide something, kicking him hard in the side. Shinji gasped and grabbed at his stomach, eyes bristling as he watched her storm into the house.  
“闭嘴，”她厉声道，站起身来，脸上掠过的严厉表情让他震惊。他刚要开口，她似乎下定了决心，狠狠地踢了他侧身一脚。真嗣倒吸一口气，捂住肚子，眼中闪着怒火，看着她怒气冲冲地走进屋里。

She didn't look back. 她没有回头。

### Chapter 6: Guardian
Father Luitpold's vestments were different today. The normally pearly galloons that hung over his robes were now a deep shade of sleek, sapphire blue. At their ends was a golden cross, the insides of which were stitched with swirling white patterns.  
今天，Luitpold 神父的祭服与众不同。平时挂在他长袍上的珍珠色金银线饰边，如今变成了深邃光滑的宝石蓝。饰边的末端是一个金色的十字架，十字架内部绣着旋转的白纹图案。

The parents of the congregation had made it for him, since only last week he'd been ordained as a Minister. Shinji couldn't say what any of that meant or why, since the Wednesday worship they held every week at the _Grauen Kloster_ was no different than before. Father Luitpold read from the gospels, like he always did, while the rest of the children sat and listened – nodding sagely whenever he looked up to see he still had their attention. Then they took bits of bread and drank that rotten grape juice that made his head feel fuzzy, before ending worship with a prayer in their seats.  
会众的父母为他制作了这件祭服，因为就在上周，他被任命为牧师。真嗣说不清这意味着什么，也不知道为什么，因为他们在灰暗修道院每周三举行的礼拜与以往并无不同。Luitpold 神父像往常一样诵读福音书，其他孩子们则坐着聆听——每当他抬头确认他们仍在关注时，他们都会深以为然地点头。然后，他们分食小块面包，喝下那种让脑袋发晕的酸涩葡萄汁，最后在座位上祈祷结束礼拜。

As strange as they tasted, Shinji would much rather eat olives from their tree in the garden. He let out a deep breath through his nose, counting each second of silence that ticked by. Hushed voices slithered over the seats from the back of the hall, a few coughs here and there.  
尽管味道奇特，真嗣更愿意吃花园里他们种的橄榄。他深深地从鼻子里呼出一口气，计算着每一秒沉默的流逝。从大厅后方的座位上传来窃窃私语，偶尔夹杂着几声咳嗽。

"Do you believe in God, Asuka?" he whispered, peaking an eye open to see if she had heard him. Father Luitpold said it was important to pray, especially when their minds were troubled. God would always be there to listen. Shinji didn't understand how. Teacher never prayed to God, or to anyone now that he thought of it.  
"你相信上帝吗，明日香？" 他低声问道，微微睁开一只眼睛看她是否听到了。路易波尔德神父说祈祷很重要，尤其是在心烦意乱的时候。上帝总会倾听。真嗣不明白这是怎么回事。老师从不向上帝祈祷，或者说，现在想来，他从不向任何人祈祷。

"I guess so," Asuka said, shrugging. "Do you?"  
"我想是的，" 明日香耸耸肩说，"你呢？"

Shinji glanced at the other kids, absorbed in their worship. "I don't know."  
真嗣瞥了一眼其他沉浸在祈祷中的孩子们。"我不知道。"

Did his father believe in God? That didn't seem right, since Teacher said most people in Japan were Buddhist. Sometimes he thought of sending his prayers there, but he didn't know any of the mantras, and there wasn't a shrine for him to kneel at either.  
他父亲信上帝吗？这似乎不对，因为老师说过日本大多数人都是佛教徒。有时他想向那里祈祷，但他不知道任何经文，也没有神社可以让他跪拜。

Asuka shifted. "Mila always makes me pray before bed at night. It's stupid."  
明日香挪了挪身子。"米拉每晚睡前总让我祈祷。真蠢。"

"What do you pray for?"  
“你祈祷什么呢？”

For a second, she paused. "It doesn't matter. Making wishes is for little kids."  
有那么一瞬间，她停顿了一下。“这无关紧要。许愿是小孩子的把戏。”

Shinji didn't jibe at the fact that she was only eight. There were times to tease Asuka, if only because of how angry she would get, and then there were times to leave well enough alone. As Luitpold called an end to the Wednesday service, they filed out with the others, shouldering their backpacks as they embarked for the day's classes.  
真嗣并没有因为她的年龄只有八岁而嘲笑她。有时候可以逗逗明日香，仅仅是因为她会生气，但也有时候最好还是别惹事。当路易波尔德宣布周三的礼拜结束时，他们和其他人一起鱼贯而出，背上书包开始一天的课程。

He was prepared for a short, but complaint filled trip all the way to their class room, before they would sit down and Asuka would take to jabbing him with her pencil the rest of the day. Instead, she knit her hands behind her back, walking backwards to face him. "What do _you_ pray to God for?"  
他本以为会有一段短暂但充满抱怨的旅程，直到他们走进教室坐下，明日香会用铅笔戳他一整天。然而，她却将双手背在身后，倒着走面对着他。“你向上帝祈求什么？”

"Nothing, really. I just repeat what Luitpold says." he tugged her by the elbow, just before she would have smacked right into a pole.  
“没什么，真的。我只是重复路易波尔德说的话。”他拽着她的胳膊肘，就在她差点撞到柱子之前。

She spun, both freeing from his grip and fixing him with a critical eye. "So you don't pray for anything?"  
她转身，既挣脱了他的手，又用挑剔的眼神盯着他。“那你什么都不祈祷吗？”

"No. What should I pray for?"  
“不。我应该祈祷什么？”

"Idiot, how should I know?" they passed by the inner courtyard, just outside the door where their teacher was waiting for her students to amble in. Asuka's lips perked and she pushed a finger against his forehead. "Maybe you should ask God for a brain!"  
"傻瓜，我怎么知道？"他们经过内院，就在老师等待学生们慢慢进来的门口外。明日香嘴角上扬，用手指戳了戳他的额头。"也许你应该向上帝祈求一个大脑！"

He swiped at her hand. "Shut up."  
他挥手挡开她的手。"闭嘴。"

She twirled away, making her skirt flutter. "Sorry, I don't listen to dumb people."  
她旋转着避开，让裙子飘动起来。"抱歉，我不听傻瓜的话。"

"Fine," Shinji stopped, huffing. "Then I'll pray for him to send you to the moon."  
"好吧，" 真嗣停下，气呼呼地说，"那我就祈祷他把你送到月球去。"

"Fine!" she said, stamping a foot as her spin came to an end, hands on her hips. "Then _I'll_ be the first woman on the moon!"  
"好啊！" 她说着，跺了一下脚，旋转结束时双手叉腰，"那我就成为第一个登上月球的女人！"

For the rest of the day her temperament was moody, until the final hour when he ended up with a led-marked hand – where she even managed to draw a little blood. Then she was better. He knew it wasn't just about his comment to send her far away to the moon. Even though they were on speaking terms again, she never mentioned her real mother, and seemed content to pretend the subject had never been broached.  
那天剩下的时间里，她的情绪一直很阴沉，直到最后一刻，他的手上留下了铅笔痕迹——她甚至设法画出了一点血。之后她才好转。他知道这不仅仅是因为他那句要把她送到月球的话。尽管他们又恢复了交谈，但她再也没有提起过她的亲生母亲，似乎很满足于假装这个话题从未被提起过。

Still, at times he couldn't help but wonder if he'd really been forgiven.  
尽管如此，有时他还是忍不住怀疑自己是否真的被原谅了。

Last year, with the addition of English to the curriculum, Shinji had been paired off with Marcel as his learning partner. If only because no one else wanted to be stuck with him. It was also part of a dogged campaign carried out by their teacher Wilhelm to force the brother and sister to socialize instead of pairing off with each other by default.  
去年，随着课程中加入了英语，真嗣被安排与马塞尔成为学习伙伴。仅仅是因为没人愿意和他搭档。这也是他们的老师威廉为了坚持让这对兄妹与其他人社交，而不是默认彼此为伴所采取的一系列努力的一部分。

Marcel only agreed if his sister Lucija was put with them. Even though it nearly defeated the purpose, Wilhelm begrudgingly accepted the compromise. He handed out worksheets and highlighted all the proper notes in their textbooks, and Shinji found that Marcel had an awful time reading in German, which was why he insisted on having his sister there to do it for him. His grades were fine, though he scored low in just about all of their social categories. His English scores soon became just as abysmal, which in turn affected _Shinji's_ grade.  
马塞尔只同意如果他的妹妹露西娅也加入他们。尽管这几乎违背了初衷，威廉还是勉强接受了这一妥协。他分发了练习册，并在他们的教科书上标出了所有正确的笔记，真嗣发现马塞尔在德语阅读方面非常困难，这就是为什么他坚持要让妹妹在场帮他阅读。尽管他的成绩还不错，但在几乎所有的社交类别中得分都很低。他的英语成绩很快就变得同样糟糕，这反过来又影响了真嗣的成绩。

So he finally asked him why he didn't just speak German so other people could help him, and the boy's shouted reply nearly knocked him off his feet. But he yelled in his native tongue and, red faced, combed a hand through his dark brown hair. Then tried again, quieter.  
所以他终于问他为什么不直接说德语，这样别人也能帮他，男孩的吼叫几乎让他站不稳。但他用母语大声回应，涨红了脸，伸手梳理着深棕色的头发。然后又试了一次，这次声音小了些。

"My parents are just making us go here since we moved," he said in German, expression sour. "This isn't my country. I don't have to speak German if I don't want to."  
“我父母只是因为我们搬家才让我们来这里，”他用德语说，表情不悦。“这不是我的国家。如果我不想，我就不必说德语。”

The impulse to speak failed to reach Shinji's lips, and all he could manage was a blank stare. He hadn't forgotten his first few months in this country. How much he'd hated it before he met Asuka, even if he'd never seen it beyond the garden. He wasn't born here. Almost no one looked like him, and the only reason he'd been sent away was because no one wanted him in his own country. This was his home. At the thought, Marcel's words didn't sit right in his mind anymore. The moment of kinship was swept away by something warm and trembling.  
冲动未能到达真嗣的唇边，他只能茫然地盯着。他没有忘记自己刚到这个国家的那几个月。在遇到明日香之前，他有多么讨厌这里，尽管他从未走出过花园。他不是在这里出生的。几乎没有人长得像他，而他被送走的唯一原因是在自己的国家没人想要他。这里是他的家。想到这里，马塞尔的话在他心中不再合适。那一刻的亲切感被某种温暖而颤抖的东西冲走了。

He was tired of Teacher's dejected sighs and his best friend's snide taunts. He was tired of not being good enough.  
他对老师的沮丧叹息和好友的尖刻嘲讽感到厌倦。他厌倦了自己总是不够好。

Shinji lashed out and hit Marcel in the shoulder, hard. "Then you won't learn anything," he snarled. The regret was immediate. But he was too angry to stop. "And everyone will keep thinking you're stupid and no one will care about you!" it was probably the maddest he gotten at anyone aside from Asuka.  
真嗣猛地出手，重重地打在马塞尔的肩膀上。“那你就什么也学不到，”他咆哮道。后悔立刻涌上心头。但他太生气了，无法停下来。“而且每个人都会继续认为你愚蠢，没人会在乎你！”这可能是他除了明日香之外对任何人发过的最大脾气。

Marcel's eyes widened and he took a step back. After another terse pause, he shouldered his pack and left without a word. When Shinji told Asuka about it later and lamented his grade, she said, "Well, it's your own fault."  
马塞尔的眼睛睁大了，他后退了一步。又是一阵短暂的沉默后，他背起背包，一言不发地离开了。当真嗣后来告诉明日香这件事并哀叹自己的成绩时，她说：“好吧，这是你自找的。”

He fixed her with a nasty glare. "What if I was _your_ partner and left you to do all the work?"  
他用一种恶狠狠的目光盯着她。“如果我是你的搭档，却让你一个人做所有的工作，你会怎么想？”

"You wouldn't," she said, and Shinji realized he wouldn't abandon Marcel either.  
“你不会的，”她说道，而真嗣意识到他自己也不会抛弃马塞尔。

He met the boy at his usual haunt by the west gate to the schoolyard. Lucija glared at him. "Sorry for hitting you," Shinji said. He really meant it too. If he could take it all back, he would. Marcel stood, hands balled. Shinji didn't flinch or try to stop him. It was only fair.  
他在学校西门旁的常去之处见到了那个男孩。卢奇亚瞪着他。“抱歉打了你，”真嗣说道。他是真心的。如果可以重来，他愿意一切回到原点。马塞尔站着，双手紧握。真嗣没有退缩，也没有试图阻止他。这很公平。

"Will you teach me?" Marcel bit out in German, sullen, and grimacing. drawing back his surprise, Shinji agreed. The rest of their partnership was an exercise in patience, and a brooding frustration for both. But they managed a passing 3 by the end of it, and rarely interacted much after that. At least now Marcel was talking with the Austrians, who shared his border and warmed up to him faster than Shinji ever might have.  
"你会教我吗？" 马塞尔用德语咬牙切齿地说道，一脸阴沉且皱着眉头。惊讶之余，真嗣同意了。他们合作剩下的部分成了一场耐心的考验，对双方来说都是一种阴郁的挫败。但最终他们勉强得了个 3 分，之后便很少再有互动。至少现在马塞尔开始和奥地利人交谈了，他们与他共享边界，比真嗣可能做到的要更快接纳他。

The following fall, students were encouraged to participate in a school club or sport, with the subtle hint that it would again be counted towards a social grade. Asuka said he should get on a soccer team, since she watched him play during recess sometimes and said he was pretty good. Probably good enough to get into Wolfsburg one day. Maybe even Dortmund if he really tried.  
接下来的秋天，学生们被鼓励参加学校的俱乐部或运动，隐晦地暗示这会再次计入社交评分。明日香建议他应该加入足球队，因为她有时看他在课间玩耍，并说他踢得相当不错。或许有一天足够好能进入沃尔夫斯堡队。如果他真的努力，甚至可能去多特蒙德。

"Not Bayern München? Marcel said they won the Supercup a few years ago, I think."  
"不是拜仁慕尼黑吗？马塞尔说他们几年前赢了超级杯，我想。"

"Yeah, but now they're all just a bunch of snobs their rich parents bought in. Dortmund could beat them for the cup if they weren't such dirty players."  
“是啊，但现在他们不过是一群被有钱父母买来的势利眼。如果不是踢得那么脏，多特蒙德本可以击败他们赢得奖杯的。”

Shinji disagreed, if only because Asuka was so decidedly against them, and the subject turned into an argument every time soccer came up. In the end, Shinji joined the _Kloster's_ team for his grade level. All he had to do was run around and kick a ball, how hard could that be? Practice left his legs shaky on the return home, and games made him uneasy, especially when he was put in as goalie. It didn't help that the recess bullies from his first year made up a majority of the team, and basically ignored him if he was out on the field with them. Only a few teammates extended the courtesy of passing to him.  
真嗣并不赞同，仅仅是因为明日香坚决反对，而且每次提到足球这个话题都会引发争论。最终，真嗣加入了克洛斯特学校的年级队伍。他所要做的不过是跑动和踢球，这能有多难呢？训练结束后，他的双腿颤抖着回家，比赛则让他感到不安，尤其是当他被安排担任守门员时。更糟糕的是，一年级时的那些校园恶霸占据了球队的大多数，他们在真嗣在场外时基本上无视他。只有少数队友会礼貌性地传球给他。

The coach delegated him to defense positions only, trading his offense spot with a blonde haired girl that always had a smile, but took on an intensity to her when out on the field.  
教练只让他担任防守位置，用他的进攻位置与一个总是面带微笑的金发女孩交换，她在场上时会展现出一种强烈的专注。

---

The whistle screamed and the referee called an end to the game. Shinji's chest heaved, his head throbbing from the baking rays of the sun. Cheers echoed from the sidelines of the field, the rest of his yellow-clad teammates jogging to share in the blonde girl's victory with praise and smiles.  
哨声尖锐地响起，裁判宣布比赛结束。真嗣的胸膛剧烈起伏，烈日炙烤下的头部隐隐作痛。场边传来欢呼声，他身穿黄色队服的队友们小跑过来，与那位金发女孩分享胜利的喜悦，赞许与微笑交织。

Along with the opposing team, he jogged over to his things on the side of the field, knees aching. To his left a woman combed a hand through her chestnut hair, holding out a bottle of water for her son, who gulped half of it down before gasping for air. His father took a knee so they were eye level, a big hand on his shoulder while he talked animatedly. Then he stood, ruffling the boy's hair before the trio made to leave.  
他与对方球队的队员们一起小跑向场边的个人物品，膝盖隐隐作痛。在他左侧，一位女士用手梳理着她的栗色头发，递给儿子一瓶水，男孩猛灌了一半后喘着气。他的父亲单膝跪地，使他们视线齐平，一只大手搭在他的肩上，热情地交谈着。随后他起身，揉了揉男孩的头发，三人便准备离开。

Everywhere Shinji looked he saw much the same for every child, save for the blonde. She lingered by a group of girls, smile never faltering.  
真嗣环顾四周，每个孩子身边几乎都是同样的情景，唯独那位金发女孩例外。她停留在女孩们中间，笑容始终不曾消减。

Gathering up his duffel bag, he quit the field and found the black Lexus that was always waiting to take him back to the Langley estate.  
他收拾好行李袋，离开了训练场，找到了那辆总是等候着载他回兰利庄园的黑色雷克萨斯。

Five years. It had only been three since his father had given him his orders from Gehirn. He still didn't much understand what it was he was supposed to be doing, holding on to the reassurance that someday – he would. Teacher told him it was for the sake of mankind, but all he and Asuka had done was visit Lützow for cognitive puzzles. He didn't see how that was supposed to help him pilot... whatever he was piloting. Besides, if what they were doing was so important, why did it have to be a secret? If everyone knew what a big job he had to do, they might treat him nicer.  
五年了。自从父亲从 Gehirn 给他下达命令以来，才过去了三年。他仍然不太明白自己应该做什么，只是抱着有一天会明白的希望。老师告诉他这是为了人类的福祉，但他和明日香所做的不过是去吕措夫进行认知谜题。他不明白这怎么会有助于他驾驶……无论他在驾驶什么。而且，如果他们所做的事情如此重要，为什么必须保密？如果大家都知道他有一个重要的任务，他们可能会对他更好些。

Arriving at the estate, the walk through the garden to his small house was longer than usual, the white-hot sun stinging at him through the trees. Once inside, he greeted Teacher and went to his room, where he found Asuka sitting on his bed in her uniform. Her tongue was pinched between her lips as she smashed the controller buttons, leaning with the twists and turns of the game.  
到达庄园后，穿过花园到他小屋的路比平时更长，炽热的阳光透过树丛刺痛着他。一进门，他向老师问好，然后走进自己的房间，发现明日香穿着制服坐在他的床上。她紧咬着舌头，用力按着控制器按钮，随着游戏的曲折变化而倾斜身体。

It wasn't _his_ PlayStation, of course. Asuka had brought it over after she'd gotten it for Christmas last year. As Summer breaks went by, the girl had turned his room into a sort of home away from home. During those months, he found himself sharing his bed more often than not. They'd lay back to back, making jokes that traditionally began with "what if..." to see who could get the other to laugh out loud first. Other times they fought for mattress space, because some nights Asuka's feet got cold and she'd shove them up against his to steal warmth.  
当然，这不是他的 PlayStation。去年圣诞节，明日香收到后把它带了过来。随着暑假的流逝，女孩将他的房间变成了一个类似远离家乡的家。在那几个月里，他发现自己多半时间都在分享他的床。他们背对背躺着，用传统上以“如果……会怎样”开头的笑话来逗对方，看谁能先让对方大笑出声。其他时候，他们争夺床垫空间，因为有些夜晚明日香的脚会冷，她会把脚贴在他身上偷取温暖。

When he didn't feel like being kicked in his sleep, he set up a camping sack for himself on the floor. It was comfortable enough, and Asuka usually made a game of poking at him from the height of the bed regardless. Or they sat close and stayed up late playing video games. During Summer vacation, Asuka didn't have to worry about her step-mom coming to fetch her in place of her dad for school or anything. The adults just didn't seem to care one way or another so long as they weren't bothering them or causing trouble.  
当他不想在睡梦中被踢时，他就在地板上铺了个睡袋。虽然还算舒适，但明日香通常会从床上俯身逗弄他，以此为乐。或者他们坐得很近，熬夜玩游戏。暑假期间，明日香不必担心继母代替父亲来接她上学或做其他事情。只要他们不打扰大人或惹麻烦，大人们似乎并不在乎。

Shinji tossed his duffel bag in the corner, disappearing to change, and emerging clad in baggy plaid pajama pants and a gray shirt.  
真嗣把他的旅行袋扔到角落，消失了一会儿去换衣服，再出现时穿着宽松的格子睡裤和一件灰色 T 恤。

"What's this?" he asked. “这是什么？”他问道。

"Ace Fighter Zero," she said, jerking back and leaning to the right as her fighter jet made a hard turn. "Last level."  
“王牌战士零号，”她说着，身体猛地向后一仰，同时向右倾斜，仿佛她的战斗机正在急转弯。“最后一关。”

The screen was alight with green indicators that flared red when missiles streaked by. Her own targeter struggled as she tried to gain locks on the enemy fighters, who seemed to be able to break the path of her tracking missiles all too easily.  
屏幕上闪烁着绿色的指示灯，当导弹划过时变为红色。她自己的瞄准器在试图锁定敌方战斗机时显得力不从心，那些敌机似乎总能轻易摆脱她的追踪导弹。

Shinji settled atop his bed next to her, stomach down. "Hey... do you know what they're going to have us do tomorrow?"  
真嗣趴在床上，靠近她旁边。“嘿...你知道明天他们要我们做什么吗？”

"No. Lützow didn't say what the new training would be."  
“不知道。吕措没说新的训练内容是什么。”

In big red letters the words _Missile Lock_ flashed over the video game HUD.  
巨大的红色字母在电子游戏 HUD 上闪烁着‘导弹锁定’的字样。

"Do you think we'll actually start learning to pilot now?"  
“你觉得我们现在会开始学习驾驶了吗？”

"I don't know– _no!_" Her fighter exploded and she threw the controller, fingers combing through her hair. "You ruined my concentration!"  
“我不知道——不！”她的战斗机爆炸了，她扔掉控制器，手指梳理着头发。“你毁了我的专注！”

"Sorry." "对不起。"

She growled and fell back on the mattress. "No you're not," she sighed, tugging at the red ribbons holding up her hair. Shinji sank his face into the comforter, not even flinching when she whacked his thigh back-handed. It was sloppy and devoid of malice, the beatings themselves acting more like a means of communication. He still didn't understand the language.  
她咆哮一声，倒回床垫上。“不，你不是，”她叹息着，拉扯着固定她头发的红丝带。真嗣把脸埋进被子里，即使她反手拍了他的大腿，他也丝毫没有退缩。那动作既草率又毫无恶意，这些拍打本身更像是一种交流方式。他仍然不懂这种语言。

"Did you win your game today?" she asked.  
“你今天赢了比赛吗？”她问道。

"Yeah. They made me a sweeper like always. The midfielders didn't let the other team have the ball much, though."  
“嗯。他们像往常一样让我当清道夫。不过中场球员没让对方拿到多少球。”

She sat up, feet searching for her shoes on the floor. "Why don't you have the coach put you back on offense?"  
她坐起身，双脚在地上摸索着鞋子。“为什么不让教练把你调回进攻位置？”

He shrugged. "I don't really wanna' be."  
他耸了耸肩。“我其实不太想。”

Asuka rolled her eyes. _This_ language he knew – _typical Shinji_, was the translation. Although he had a feeling even if he asked, the coach would just say no since he'd done nothing to prove he could be more useful in a forward position. So there was no point.  
明日香翻了个白眼。这种语言他懂——典型的真嗣，翻译过来就是这样。尽管他有种感觉，即使他提出要求，教练也只会拒绝，因为他没有做任何事情来证明他在前锋位置上能更有用。所以没有意义。

Wiggling her shoes on, Asuka bounced off his bed and made for the door. "See ya'."  
阿斯兰卡穿上鞋子，从他的床上跳下来，向门口走去。“再见。”

"Night 'Suka," he said mid-yawn, earning himself a glare before she disappeared.  
“晚安，阿斯兰卡，”他打着哈欠说道，换来她消失前的一记白眼。

The TV gave off a high-pitched whine and the PlayStation hummed. Standing, he shut them down, flicked off his light and rolled into bed – realizing Asuka had left behind some of her things as he came face to face with his nightstand.  
电视发出尖锐的嗡鸣声，PlayStation 也嗡嗡作响。他站起身，关闭了它们，关掉灯，滚进被窝——意识到阿斯兰卡留下了一些东西，当他面对床头柜时。

She slept in his room, played games on his bed, and rode to and from school with him. Despite how close she always was, ever since that night on her back patio, at times it felt like she resided in the mansion's upper floor, peering at him from the window while he remained in the garden far below.  
她睡在他的房间，在他的床上玩游戏，和他一起往返学校。尽管她总是那么亲近，但从那个晚上在后院露台之后，有时她感觉自己就像住在豪宅的顶楼，从窗户俯视着他，而他则留在远处的花园里。

---

After enduring language lessons for the better part of the morning, Shinji set up shop at the northwest entrance to the school. He and Asuka usually shared lunch around this time, he just had to wait for her to get out of some advanced tutoring session on the other side of the campus.  
忍受了将近一上午的语言课程后，真嗣在学校西北入口处安顿下来。他和明日香通常在这个时候一起吃午饭，他只需等她从校园另一边的进阶辅导课中出来。

So he people-watched, trying not to seem conspicuous, and spotted a familiar face through the hustle and bustle. Scharnhorst, as Shinji had come to know him, had managed to retain his rotund figure. The boy's eyes found his, giving him pause as he searched for the red haired devil. If the Japanese boy was about, that meant Asuka couldn't be far either. His gaze settled on Shinji again, body fidgeting with palpable nervousness. Seizing his resolve in a tightened pair of fists, he fast-walked down the hall, scurrying down the stairs as he passed Shinji.  
于是他观察着过往的人群，尽量不显得突兀，并在熙熙攘攘中认出了一张熟悉的面孔。沙恩霍斯特，正如真嗣所了解的那样，成功保持了他圆润的身材。那男孩的目光找到了他，让他停顿了一下，同时寻找着红发魔女。如果日本男孩在场，那就意味着明日香也不会离得太远。他的目光再次落在真嗣身上，身体因明显的紧张而扭动。他紧握双拳，坚定了决心，快步走过走廊，匆匆下楼，经过真嗣身边。

Scharnhorst had been his first bully but not his last. After the boy had been thoroughly humiliated by Asuka, most kids in his year seemed to hold an aversion to him as rumors flitted about, catching as easily as wild fire. He was the strange foreign boy. Much easier to dislike than Asuka.  
沙恩霍斯特是他遇到的第一个欺负他的人，但绝不是最后一个。自从那男孩被明日香彻底羞辱后，他同年级的孩子们似乎都对他产生了反感，谣言四起，如同野火般迅速蔓延。他是那个奇怪的外国男孩，比起明日香，更容易让人不喜欢。

Once, a group of them had attempted to gang up on him. Well, they _had_ ganged up on him. He'd come home sporting a yellow and purple bruise under his right eye that perfectly framed the contour of the socket, while black and red splotches from busted blood vessels had colored his stomach. If not for Asuka arriving to pelt them with stones from the garden plots, it probably would've been a lot worse.  
有一次，一群人试图围攻他。是的，他们确实围攻了他。他回家时，右眼下有一块黄紫色的淤青，正好框住了眼窝的轮廓，而腹部则是因破裂的血管形成的黑红色斑点。如果不是明日香及时赶到，用花园里的石头向他们投掷，情况可能会更糟。

Leaning against the open door, movement drew his eyes up to a girl just a little shorter than he, blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail. She went rigid as their eyes met and Shinji looked around, wondering if she was waiting for someone else.  
倚靠在敞开的门边，他的目光被一个动作吸引，看向了一个比他稍矮的女孩，金色的头发扎成马尾。当他们的目光相遇时，她立刻僵住了，真嗣环顾四周，想知道她是否在等其他人。

"Um, hi, Shinji," she said, pulling his attention back. No detached or polite 'good afternoon', and she knew his name. She stood with her feet close, hand gripping her school bag tight and worry sitting on her brow. Something nagged at the back of his mind – something about the way she looked.  
“呃，嗨，真嗣，”她开口，将他的注意力拉了回来。没有客套的‘下午好’，她直接叫了他的名字。她双脚并拢站着，手紧紧抓着书包，眉宇间满是忧虑。某种感觉在他脑海深处挥之不去——关于她的神情。

"Hi," he said, relatively sure he was dreaming as it clicked: this was one of the girls from his soccer team. A thick tension sat over his chest as the silence between them dragged. All the while his reeling brain scrambled – _what was her name again?_  
“嗨，”他回应道，相当确定自己是在做梦，因为突然间他认出了她：这是他足球队的女孩之一。一股沉重的紧张感压在胸口，两人间的沉默愈发漫长。与此同时，他混乱的大脑拼命搜索——她的名字是什么来着？

"Er– Erika, right?" he blurted.  
“呃——是艾丽卡，对吧？”他脱口而出。

"Yeah!" she said, beaming. He smiled politely and was about to claw for more conversation when an arm quite suddenly hooked through his and he was being turned around by an alarmingly cheery Asuka.  
"耶！" 她笑着说，满脸光彩。他礼貌地微笑着，正准备继续攀谈，突然一只手臂紧紧勾住了他的胳膊，他被一个异常兴奋的明日香转过身来。

"There you are! Come on, let's eat!" she said, pulling him along.  
"你在这儿啊！快来，我们去吃饭！" 她说着，拉着他往前走。

"Oh, okay, uh – sorry, bye!" he called, waving and completely missing Erika's crestfallen look.  
"哦，好的，呃——抱歉，再见！" 他喊道，挥着手，完全没有注意到艾丽卡失望的表情。

---

That afternoon, Shinji and Asuka followed Teacher into the Gehirn building. Instead of the Glass Labyrinth, they were led down concrete ramps that made a rigid spiral several floors below. A chilled air shivered through the halls, stemming from a wide corridor lined with huge metal doors. Teacher stopped at one of them, tapping at a keypad nestled into the wall next to it.  
那天下午，真嗣和明日香跟着老师进入了 GEHRIN 大楼。他们没有前往玻璃迷宫，而是被引领着走下几层楼深的混凝土坡道，这些坡道形成了坚硬的螺旋形。寒冷的空气在走廊中颤抖着穿过，这些走廊由巨大的金属门排列而成。老师在其中一扇门前停下，敲击着嵌在墙上的键盘。

The doors hissed open, allowing them passage into a massive warehouse. Bright florescent lights lined the ceiling high above, steel scaffolding and gangways darting inbetween. On the ground was an oval ring, like the one at the _Kloster_ for track, and on the walls to his right were rock-climbing segments and railings with straps and harnesses. Beneath them were slated metal doors that Shinji could only imagine the contents of. Along the left side were narrow tables and what looked like computers, bulbous pod-like things taking up most of the space.  
门嘶嘶作响地打开，让他们进入了一个巨大的仓库。高高的天花板上排列着明亮的荧光灯，钢制脚手架和通道穿梭其间。地面上有一个椭圆形的环，就像克洛斯特的田径场一样，而他右边的墙上则是攀岩段和带有带子和安全带的栏杆。它们下面是带有槽的金属门，真嗣只能想象里面的内容。左侧是一排狭窄的桌子和看起来像电脑的东西，球状的吊舱占据了大部分空间。

So utterly enamored, Shinji nearly bumped into Asuka, jumping as he realized there were other people about. In front of them was Lützow, looking out of place with his wiry physique and white lab coat. Next to him was a woman in a tan camo uniform with a blue beret, which sat atop long, dark hair. Her brown eyes regarded him kindly and he gasped – she was Japanese, like him!  
如此着迷，真嗣差点撞上明日香，当他意识到周围还有其他人时，不禁吓了一跳。在他们面前的是吕措号，他那瘦削的身躯和白色实验服显得格格不入。他旁边是一位身穿棕色迷彩服、头戴蓝色贝雷帽的女性，贝雷帽下是乌黑的长发。她那双棕色的眼睛温和地注视着他，真嗣倒吸一口气——她是日本人，和他一样！

She looked no older than some of the 13th graders he saw at the _Kloster_, at least not compared to the man beside her. His light gray uniform was impeccable, his red beret sporting a blue shield with a golden eagle streaking downward. On his chest were dozens of colored bars, leaving Shinji to wonder just how many battles the man had fought in.  
她看起来不比他在修道院见到的那些十三年级学生大，至少与她身旁的男人相比是这样。他那浅灰色的制服一尘不染，红色贝雷帽上饰有一个蓝色盾牌，上面是一只金色的鹰向下俯冲。他胸前挂着数十条彩色条纹，让真嗣不禁好奇这位男士究竟经历过多少场战斗。

Lützow smiled. "Shinji, Asuka, this is Second Lieutenant Misato Katsuragi and Captain Todd Weissenburg. As of today, they will be your instructors in physical fitness, first aid, basic survival techniques, operation of weapons _and_ maintenance of weapons."  
吕措微笑道：“真嗣，明日香，这位是二等中尉葛城美里和上尉托德·魏森堡。从今天起，他们将成为你们在体能训练、急救、基本生存技能、武器操作及维护方面的教官。”

Weissenburg only grunted, steely eyes unwavering. Miss Katsuragi, however, bent forward with her hands on her knees. "Hello~!"  
魏森堡只是哼了一声，钢铁般的目光坚定不移。然而，葛城小姐却弯下腰，双手撑在膝盖上。“你好~！”

Shinji faltered for a moment, belatedly deciding to greet them both in German before bowing. "It's nice to meet you, Mister Weissenburg, Miss Katsuragi."  
真嗣犹豫了一下，决定迟来地用德语向他们两人打招呼，然后鞠躬。“很高兴见到您，魏森堡先生，葛城小姐。”

The German soldier shook his head. "You will address me as either 'sir' or 'Captain'. Understood?"  
那位德国士兵摇了摇头。“你要称呼我为‘先生’或‘上尉’。明白了吗？”

He gulped. "Yes, sir." 他咽了口唾沫。“是的，先生。”

The Japanese woman flashed him a grin and winked. "You can just call me Misato, 'kay handsome?"  
那位日本女子朝他露齿一笑，眨了眨眼。“你可以直接叫我美里，好吗，帅哥？”

Shinji's face got really hot.  
真嗣的脸变得滚烫。

A touch on his shoulder reminded him Teacher was still there. "Behave yourself. I will see you in two hours." with that, the man departed – as did Lützow.  
肩上的一触提醒他，老师还在。“规矩点。两小时后见。”说完，那人便离开了——吕佐夫也跟着走了。

No sooner had they left than Katsuragi handed them each a bundle of clothes, instructing them to use the locker rooms across the way to change into the new blue shorts and a sleeveless white shirt. When they came out, their new instructors had changed as well – each of them sporting sweat pants and shirt.  
他们刚走，Katsuragi 就递给他们每人一包衣服，指示他们去对面更衣室换上新的蓝色短裤和无袖白衬衫。出来时，他们的几位新教官也换了装——每个人都穿着运动裤和衬衫。

"We'll just go over the easy stuff for now," she said as they closed the distance.  
“我们先从简单的开始，”她边说边缩短了距离。

Weissenburg seemed to be doing his best to ignore her and sat down with his legs crossed, motioning for them to do the same. "Before we teach you anything, you have to know how to condition your body. So we will stretch _first_."  
魏森堡似乎在尽力忽视她，交叉双腿坐下，示意他们也这样做。“在我们教你任何东西之前，你必须学会如何调理身体。所以我们先来拉伸。”

He and Asuka shared a glance.  
他和明日香交换了一个眼神。

Weissenburg led them through over an hour of calisthenics, explaining why each particular bend was important and what muscle it stretched. Shinji already knew a little from his soccer coach, but this was completely different. It made Shinji's whole body scream with fire, tingling with an unreachable itch in his skin, his neck crawling as if there were hordes of ants scuttling down his spine. It was the worst hour of torture in his entire life. Most of their stretching they accomplished on the floor, the other half by standing. Shinji knew Weissenburg must have done that on purpose just to make it hurt more.  
魏森堡带领他们进行了一个多小时的体操训练，解释每一个特定动作的重要性以及它拉伸的肌肉。真嗣从他的足球教练那里已经知道一些，但这完全不同。这让真嗣全身像被火焰灼烧，皮肤刺痛着一种无法触及的痒，脖子像是有成群的蚂蚁沿着脊椎爬行。这是他一生中最糟糕的折磨时刻。大部分拉伸动作他们在地板上完成，另一半则是站立进行。真嗣知道魏森堡一定是故意这么做的，只是为了让疼痛更甚。

It also didn't help that he couldn't stop looking at Miss Misato. Every time she would catch him staring, she would smile and his heart would beat faster.  
更糟糕的是，他无法停止对 Misato 小姐的注视。每次她发现他在盯着她，她都会微笑，而他的心跳则会加速。

At last, the torture ended and they were given water. Weissenburg led them to the tables on the left side of the gym, where they were given crackers to munch on while he unfolded several large sheets of paper, all with mind-boggling arrays of lines. From what he gathered, they were some kind of maps, but the numbers and letters on them didn't make sense, and seemed to have been arranged at random. They were shown how to read it all and how to use it for land navigation with the aid of a compass.  
终于，折磨结束了，他们得到了水。Weissenburg 带领他们到体育馆左侧的桌子旁，在那里他们得到了一些饼干咀嚼，同时他展开了几张大纸，上面布满了令人眼花缭乱的线条。据他所知，这些是某种地图，但上面的数字和字母毫无意义，似乎是随机排列的。他们被教导如何阅读这一切，以及如何借助指南针使用这些地图进行陆地导航。

Mercifully, the lesson ended when Weissenburg stowed everything away. "That's all for now. You will be reporting back here everyday at eighteen-hundred. You're free to leave."  
幸运的是，当 Weissenburg 收拾好一切时，课程结束了。“今天就到这里。你们每天十八点都要回到这里报到。现在你们可以自由离开了。”

Shinji turned to the door leading into the warehouse, Teacher waiting for them by the threshold.  
真嗣转向通往仓库的门，老师在门槛处等着他们。

"See ya' tomorrow," Miss Misato said, hands on her hips as she watched them go. He knew she watched them out because he kept glancing at her over his shoulder, never quite satisfied with the brief look he managed to get each time.  
“明天见，”美里小姐双手叉腰，目送他们离开。他知道她在看着他们，因为他不停地回头看她，每次都未能满足于那短暂的目光。

As they got home, Asuka sighed loudly and threw herself onto his bed. Shinji set his backpack down and began fishing out all of the books and papers he would need for homework. His back and thighs protested as he sat and he tried to massage the agitated muscles, though moving his arms just made his shoulders roll in their joints and sting.  
他们回到家时，明日香大声叹了口气，扑倒在真嗣的床上。真嗣放下书包，开始翻找做作业所需的所有书本和纸张。他坐下时，背部和大腿都在抗议，他试图按摩那些紧张的肌肉，但移动手臂只是让肩膀在关节中滚动并刺痛。

"I don't like her," Asuka said, flipping onto her back and folding her hands behind her head.  
“我不喜欢她，”明日香说着翻了个身，双手枕在脑后。

Shinji twisted 'round. "Who?"  
真嗣转过身来。“谁？”

Her eyes flashed. "Katsuragi! Who else, stupid?"  
她的目光一闪。“葛城！还能有谁，笨蛋？”

Shinji felt himself stiffen, not entirely sure why that made his heart gallop so suddenly. "Why?" he asked, swallowing past a led bolt in his throat, "she seemed nice."  
真嗣感到自己身体一僵，不太明白为何这会让他的心跳突然加速。“为什么？”他问道，咽下喉咙里的一块铅，“她看起来挺好的。”

"You think that about everyone. It's just a trick," Asuka said, eyes boring into the ceiling.  
“你对每个人都这么想。这只是个把戏，”明日香说，眼睛盯着天花板。

The silence that followed was barbed, the frogs outside beginning their chorus of warbling chirps. Shinji went back to his work, confident that Asuka would let the matter be and either play video games or go home. Maybe he could get at least one geometry problem done before he became too distracted with whatever she decided to play.  
随之而来的沉默带着刺，外面的青蛙开始它们的颤音合唱。真嗣回到自己的工作，自信明日香会让这事过去，要么玩游戏要么回家。也许在他被她决定玩的东西分心之前，他至少能解决一道几何题。

"Do you think she's pretty?" Asuka asked.  
"你觉得她漂亮吗？" 明日香问道。

When he looked up, she was resolutely staring at the ceiling. "What?"  
当他抬头时，她正坚定地盯着天花板。"什么？"

Asuka's nose twitched. "Do you think she's pretty?" she asked with more force, sitting up.  
明日香的鼻子动了动。"你觉得她漂亮吗？" 她更加有力地问道，坐了起来。

The air was taut now, a chord ready to snap if it was tweaked just the wrong way. He started to panic, annoyed all the same that she was even asking such a thing. Why did she care, anyway? "Uh, well, ye– no, I mean, um–"  
"空气此刻紧绷如弦，只需稍稍错触便会断裂。他开始恐慌，同时又恼怒她竟会问出这样的问题。她为何要在意？“呃，这个，是——不，我是说，嗯——””

She turned her head with a, "Humph!" and pointed her nose to the air, arms folding over her chest.  
她扭过头，哼了一声，鼻子朝天，双臂交叉抱在胸前。

Shinji blinked. "What are you doing?"  
"真嗣眨了眨眼。“你在做什么？””

She turned her head again. "I don't want to look at your face right now," she said in a regal tone.  
她再次转过头。“我现在不想看你的脸，”她用一种高贵的语气说道。

Another blink, his expression bordering bemused. He picked up his ruler and went back to work, something about her tone irking him. He glanced at the ruler and then to her, unwavering in her dedication to ignoring him. But if she really wanted to ignore him, she would have left already. He smiled a little.  
他又眨了眨眼，表情带着一丝好笑。他拿起尺子，继续工作，她的语气让他有些不悦。他瞥了一眼尺子，又看向她，她坚定地无视他。但如果她真的想无视他，她早就离开了。他微微一笑。

Reaching over, he swiped the ruler at her hair, throwing a lock over her shoulder – turning and hiding the stick. Her head whipped around just as he looked to his book, leaving no evidence that he had in fact just tossed up her hair. Eying him up and down, she reluctantly showed him her back.  
他伸手过去，用尺子挑起她的一缕头发，甩到她的肩上——转身并藏起了尺子。她的头猛地转过来时，他已看向自己的书，没有留下任何他刚刚挑起她头发的证据。她上下打量着他，不情愿地转过身去。

Suppressing a smirk by biting his tongue, he eased the ruler out and swiped her hair again. He was reading his book when she snapped around, an unspoken threat in her eyes. He pretended not to notice and with every ounce of will managed to look bored. He let the time breathe a little, a good thing too since she kept shooting him sharp glances. Minutes passed until finally she let her guard down enough and he eased the ruler free of its hiding place.  
他咬住舌头抑制住笑意，轻轻抽出尺子，再次拂过她的头发。她猛地转过身来，眼中闪烁着无声的威胁。他假装没注意到，竭尽全力装出一副无聊的样子。他让时间稍稍缓和，这倒是件好事，因为她不断向他投来锐利的目光。几分钟过去了，最终她放松了警惕，他趁机将尺子从藏匿处抽出。

As he inched it closer a third time, her shoulders rose – and she pounced, tackling him and causing them both to tumble across the floor as they started to wrestle.  
当他第三次慢慢靠近时，她的肩膀耸起——她猛扑过来，将他扑倒在地，两人开始扭打，滚作一团。

"Today, you're going to learn about hand-to-hand combat," Misato said. They were standing in the center of the running track, its gold and black patterns soft and spongy beneath Shinji's feet, yet firm enough not to give much under his weight.  
“今天，你要学习近身格斗，”美里说道。他们站在跑道中央，金色和黑色的图案柔软而有弹性，踩在真嗣脚下却坚实得不会轻易下陷。

After two weeks of learning to use grid maps and coming to understand the differences in elevation marks, larger and smaller scales, as well as how to measure distances, this sounded like a welcome change to the tedium of those lessons. The only part that concerned him was combat.  
经过两周学习使用网格地图并理解了高程标记、大小比例尺以及如何测量距离的差异后，这听起来像是对那些枯燥课程的一种受欢迎的改变。唯一让他担心的是战斗部分。

"Me an' Shinji wrestle a lot," Asuka said with a certain air of superiority. As if she were in on some secret about fighting that the two adults were not.  
"我和真嗣经常摔跤，" 明日香带着一种优越感说道。仿佛她掌握了一些关于战斗的秘密，而两位成年人却不知道。

"Oh, really?" Misato asked, sporting a smug look, "what about how to hit properly, then?"  
"哦，真的吗？" 美里问道，脸上带着得意的表情，"那关于如何正确打击呢？"

She answered by punching Shinji in the shoulder.  
她回答的方式是给了真治肩膀一拳。

Weissenburg chuckled. "In some ways, yes. But in your hand, there many little bones that can break if you hit them too hard."  
魏森堡轻笑道：“在某种程度上，是的。但在你的手中，有许多小骨头如果击打得太重就会断裂。”

Shinji's head tilted to one side. "How else do you hit someone?"  
真治的头歪向一边。“那还能怎么打人呢？”

And so they were instructed on 'soft' and 'hard' points, where to hit someone to cause the greatest amount of damage, and which part of the body to use. They showed them where to hold their hands, how to throw their arms and legs, drilled them on footwork.  
于是他们被教导了‘软’点和‘硬’点，即击打何处能造成最大伤害，以及应使用身体的哪个部位。他们展示了如何握手、如何挥动手臂和腿，还训练了他们的步法。

Whenever Shinji fumbled, Asuka rubbed his nose in it. Misato would chuckle, but there was endearment in her smile.  
每当真嗣出错时，明日香就会毫不留情地指出来。美里会轻笑，但她的笑容中带着宠溺。

"We'll work on it." She'd say.  
“我们会改进的。”她会说。

Everyday they returned, stretched, and endured yet more lessons on land navigation before practicing hand-to-hand. They learned the first steps of Judo and Jiu-Jitsu, with Misato and Weissenburg teaching them how to make strikes to disorient or hit pressure points, or where to hold their arms to defend against incoming blows. The wrestling portion of their training required very little instruction. Combined with Judo, it became less about submitting and more about how far they could throw one another across the mats, much to Misato's amusement.  
每天他们回来后，伸展身体，忍受更多关于陆地导航的课程，然后练习近身格斗。他们学习了柔道和巴西柔术的基础，由美里和魏森堡教导他们如何进行打击以迷惑或击中穴位，或者如何持臂防御来袭的攻击。他们的摔跤训练部分几乎不需要太多指导。结合柔道，这变得不那么注重降服，而是更多地关注他们能将对方扔出多远，这让美里感到十分有趣。

One day Weissenburg motioned for them to come close as he drew a black knife from the sheath at his belt, letting their fingers test its razor sharp edge so they would understand just how easily it could part flesh. He showed them how to hold the knife in different ways, having them practice angles of attack with their own pair of rubber blades.  
一天，魏森堡示意他们靠近，他从腰间的鞘中抽出一把黑色匕首，让他们用手指测试其锋利的边缘，以便他们理解这把刀能多么轻易地切开肉体。他向他们展示了如何以不同的方式握持匕首，让他们用自己那对橡胶刀练习攻击角度。

"This weapon does not only stab," he said. "It cuts and jabs and slices."  
“这武器不仅仅用于刺，”他说，“它还能切割、戳刺和划伤。”

They learned where to stab and slice when appropriate, committing it all to muscle memory. In combat, reactions needed to be quick and deadly, or so Misato said. They were shown where to cut – told how each wound would hinder their opponent. Puncture the lung: cause internal bleeding, opponent drowns. Sever arteries: cause exsanguination. Stab neck: sever blood vessels or trachea, massive hemorrhaging and rapid blood loss.  
他们学会了在何时何地刺入和切割，将这一切转化为肌肉记忆。在战斗中，反应必须迅速且致命，这是美里所说的。他们被教导如何切割——被告知每个伤口将如何阻碍对手。刺穿肺部：造成内出血，对手窒息。切断动脉：导致失血过多。刺入颈部：切断血管或气管，大量出血和快速失血。

"But it's a small target," Misato said, touching fingers to his upper arm and thigh. "So you're better off aiming for the femoral arteries."  
“但这是一个小目标，”美里说，用手指触碰他的上臂和大腿。“所以你最好瞄准股动脉。”

"You like to slash? Use this," Weissenburg said, introducing them to a weird-shaped weapon called a bolo. It curved forward and had a fatter blade towards the tip. The hint of pride in his expression as Asuka took a liking to it was hard to miss.  
“你喜欢砍杀？用这个，”魏森堡说，向他们介绍一种形状奇特的武器，叫做波洛刀。它的刀刃向前弯曲，刀尖部分更宽。当明日香对它产生兴趣时，他脸上难以掩饰的自豪感显而易见。

As the days went by, they started to use the Filipino fighting stick, while afternoons were spent with wire-mesh masks and Kendo sticks. Both of which left him and Asuka with a myriad of yellow bruises. The following evenings in his room became a bragging session about who had the most welts. Extra points for the purple ones. On Sundays Weissenburg would have them dress in thick, black padded vests, complete with gauntlets and helmets with clear visors. He would give Asuka and Shinji each a black knife with flat edges that, with the press of a button, could deliver a small jolt of electricity on contact. Then he would have them fight.  
随着日子一天天过去，他们开始使用菲律宾战斗棍，而下午则是在铁丝网面罩和剑道棍中度过。这两样都让他们和明日香身上留下了无数的黄色淤青。接下来的晚上，在他的房间里，他们变成了炫耀谁身上的伤痕更多的比赛。紫色的伤痕还能额外加分。到了星期天，魏森堡会让他们穿上厚厚的黑色垫肩背心，配备护臂和带有透明面罩的头盔。他会分别给明日香和真嗣一把黑色、边缘平滑的刀，按下按钮就能在接触时释放一小股电流。然后，他会让他们进行对战。

Asuka was a different person in these competitions.  
在这些比赛中，明日香完全变了一个人。

Their very first fight she'd tackled him to the floor and stabbed him in the chest – twice. She didn't help him up when she stood either, and there was something cold in the way she regarded him. He knew then that this wouldn't be like their wrestling matches by the olive tree. Shinji couldn't pretend to put up a struggle and lose just to get it over with. Besides, Misato was watching and he hated getting beat in front of her.  
他们的第一次对战，她就把他扑倒在地，往他胸口刺了两刀。她站起来时也没有扶他一把，她看他的眼神里有一种冷酷。那时他就知道，这不会像他们在橄榄树下的摔跤比赛那样。真嗣不能假装挣扎一番然后故意输掉，只为了快点结束。况且，美里在旁边看着，他讨厌在她面前被打败。

Usually, Weissenburg wouldn't let them leave until he won at least three matches consecutively. Some days their sessions dragged out until the sun sank below the horizon and their fights looked more like a drunken dance. That was when Shinji discovered he could tire Asuka out. She committed everything to her attacks – so all he had to do was stall, or grapple her to the ground until Weissenburg forced them restart the match. Then, when she was good and exhausted, he could trip her or push her and win with a decisive jab.  
通常，魏森堡不会让他们离开，除非他至少连续赢得三场比赛。有些日子，他们的训练会拖到太阳沉入地平线，他们的战斗看起来更像是一场醉酒的舞蹈。那时，真嗣发现他可以让明日香筋疲力尽。她将一切都投入到她的攻击中——所以他只需要拖延，或者将她摔倒在地，直到魏森堡强迫他们重新开始比赛。然后，当她筋疲力尽时，他可以绊倒她或推她，用一记决定性的刺拳取胜。

That got her real riled up and usually she'd wrestle him into submission as soon as they got home to soothe her wounded pride.  
这让她真的非常生气，通常她一回到家就会把他摔倒在地，以平息她受伤的自尊。

It was at the end of one of these sessions that they were taken to another room adjacent to the warehouse. It was small, claustrophobic, and looked a bit like a hospital. In the middle of the room were long beds, while wires hung from the ceiling and flowed out from the back of tall machines like giant snakes. Several doctors and nurses moved back and forth between these. Lützow was amongst them and offered him a brief smile that was probably meant to be reassuring, but had the opposite effect.  
正是在这些训练结束时，他们被带到了仓库旁边的一个房间。这个房间很小，令人感到幽闭恐惧，看起来有点像医院。房间中央是长床，而电线从天花板上悬挂下来，从高大的机器后面流出，像巨大的蛇一样。几位医生和护士在这些设备之间来回穿梭。吕佐夫也在其中，向他露出了一个可能是为了安慰的短暂微笑，但效果却恰恰相反。

"What's this?" Shinji asked, climbing up as Misato patted the bed.  
“这是什么？” 真嗣问道，一边爬上床，一边看着美里拍打着床铺。

"It's so we can read and record your neural activity," she answered, commandeering a roller chair and sitting on it the wrong way – arms folded over the back-rest. One of the nurses fit a white thing with lots of wires over his head, fastening a strap under his chin. Then, without warning, slid a needle into the crease of his arm. To his right, Asuka suffered the same.  
“这是为了读取和记录你的脑部活动，”她回答道，征用了一把滚轮椅，反着坐了上去——双臂交叉搭在椅背上。一名护士在他头上套了一个带有很多线的白色装置，用下巴下的带子固定好。随后，没等他反应过来，就在他手臂的褶皱处插入了针头。在他右边，明日香也经历了同样的过程。

"Is this another test?" he asked, ripples of anxiety trembling his chest.  
“这是另一个测试吗？”他问道，胸中涌起一阵焦虑的涟漪。

"Sort of," Misato said with a half-shrug, "all you have to do is fall asleep. I'll be right here when you wake up, okay?"  
"算是吧，" 美里半耸肩地说，"你只需要睡着就行了。醒来时我还会在这里，好吗？"

He laid back, not taking his eyes from Misato for a moment. Something cold began to spill into his veins, his whole body icing over from the inside. Everything started to blur and a heavy blanket of fatigue encouraged him to sleep, tugging at his eyelids. Shinji couldn't explain why, but it felt good going to sleep knowing she would be sitting right there the whole time, watching over him. He wondered how long he could stay awake for.  
他躺下，目光一刻也不离开美里。一股寒意开始流入他的血管，整个身体从内部冻结。一切开始变得模糊，沉重的疲惫感像厚重的毯子一样催促他入睡，拉扯着他的眼皮。真嗣无法解释为什么，但知道她会一直在那里守望着他，这种感觉让他安心入睡。他不知道自己能坚持多久不睡。

"Misato?" he asked, her name slurring on his tongue. He blinked hard. "Is it normal to not believe in God?"  
"美里？" 他问道，舌头有些打结。他用力眨眼。"不相信上帝，这正常吗？"

"I guess so," she answered, shrugging. The world blurred, no matter how wide he made his eyes. He tried to focus on the cross he'd caught a glimpse of hanging from her neck, but couldn't quite manage.  
"我想是的，"她回答，耸了耸肩。无论他如何努力睁大眼睛，世界还是变得模糊不清。他试图集中注意力在她脖子上挂着的十字架上，那是他之前瞥见的，但始终无法完全看清。

Each word took a world of effort. "Then what do you... believe in?"  
每个字都耗费了极大的力气。"那么你……相信什么呢？"

Misato only smiled. "Go to sleep."  
美里只是微笑着。"去睡吧。"

As he walked through the halls of the _Grauen Kloster_, flooded with other kids getting out of class with the end of the school day, Shinji thought about the girl Erika. She was pretty, he decided, feeling foolish in the same moment. What could she have wanted to talk to him for? She hadn't tried to approach him ever since then, not even at football practice, where she went out of her way not to make eye contact with him. He told himself it didn't really bother him. Much like the Bavarians, he didn't really fit in at the _Kloster_ anyway, so it didn't matter.  
当他在格劳恩克劳斯特的走廊里穿行，周围是放学后涌出教室的孩子们，真嗣想起了女孩艾丽卡。他觉得她很漂亮，随即又觉得自己傻。她找他有什么事呢？自从那以后，她再也没有试图接近他，甚至在足球训练时，她都特意避开与他对视。他告诉自己这并不真的困扰他。就像巴伐利亚人一样，他在克劳斯特也始终格格不入，所以这并不重要。

A familiar blonde ponytail down the hall brought everything to a screaming halt, including him. The girl was leaning against the frame of the large double doors leading out into the main courtyard. Swallowing, he pretended not to notice her as he walked by.  
走廊上一头熟悉的金发马尾让一切都戛然而止，包括他。女孩靠在大双开门的外框上，通向主庭院。他咽了咽口水，假装没注意到她，从她身边走过。

"Hey, Shinji," her voice stopped him at the threshold and he turned, bracing himself.  
“嘿，真嗣，”她的声音在门槛处叫住了他，他转身，做好了准备。

"Uh, hey Erika," he said, trying to be polite. She smiled a little and he returned the expression hesitantly, heart pounding.  
"呃，嘿，Erika，" 他说道，努力表现得礼貌。她微微一笑，他犹豫地回以微笑，心跳加速。

"Can I... ask you something?"  
"我能...问你点事吗？"

"Uh, sure." he tugged at his uniform collar, which was suddenly too tight.  
"呃，当然可以。" 他拉了拉突然变得太紧的制服领子。

"Is Asuka... uh, is she your...?" Erika trailed off, eyes expectant while a shade of red crept over her cheeks. It took a second that felt like a full hour of dead silence for his brain to start working.  
"明日香...呃，她是你的...？" 艾丽卡话音渐弱，眼中满是期待，脸颊上泛起一抹红晕。他愣了一会儿，那沉默仿佛持续了一个小时，大脑才重新开始运转。

"Oh..." he said, gulping past the lump in his throat, hands waving while he hoped his face wasn't as fiery as it felt. "No, no! That'd be really weird. We're just friends since I, uh... live next to her house."  
"哦...”他咽了咽口水，喉咙里的硬块让他难以发声，双手挥舞着，希望自己的脸没有感觉中那么火辣。“不，不！那太奇怪了。我们只是朋友，因为我，呃...住在她家隔壁。”

Erika blinked. "Oh." then she giggled, a hand rising to cover her mouth. It was the most lovely sound he'd ever heard. His shoulders relaxed and he grinned, unable to help the chuckle that came forth. They were allowed to stay like that for a few moments, before his name echoed up the steps.  
艾丽卡眨了眨眼。“哦。”然后她轻笑起来，一只手抬起遮住嘴巴。那是他听过的最美妙的声音。他的肩膀放松下来，不由自主地咧嘴笑了，笑声随之而出。他们就这样停留了几分钟，直到他的名字在楼梯上回响起来。

"Shinji," a peeved Asuka barked as she marched to the doorway, "what the heck? Let's go home already!"  
"真嗣," 明日香带着一丝恼怒喊道，她快步走向门口，"搞什么鬼？我们该回家了！"

She almost stopped halfway as she spotted Erika, recognition flitting through her features before her eyes pinched. "You can go away now," she said, a hand clasping one of his arms.  
她几乎在半路上停了下来，当她看到艾丽卡时，她的脸上闪过一丝认出对方的表情，随后眼神变得锐利。"你现在可以走了，"她说着，一只手抓住了他的手臂。

He tugged against her as she started to move. "It's okay Asuka, she's from my soccer team."  
她开始移动时，他挣扎了一下。"没事的，明日香，她是我的足球队队友。"

"So what?" she looked at him like he was stupid before regarding Erika with those dismissive eyes again. "Shinji doesn't want to talk to you anymore."  
"那又怎样？" 她看着他，仿佛他是个傻瓜，然后又用那种轻蔑的眼神看向 Erika。"真嗣不想再和你说话了。"

The girl flinched. "But, uh–"  
女孩退缩了一下。"但是，呃——"

Erika jumped as Asuka stepped forward and slammed a fist against the aluminum lockers. When all she did after that was look stunned, she was given an encouraging shove. The redhead had enough of a reputation at school that the threat of getting mauled for setting off her temper was a very real concern.  
Erika 吓了一跳，因为 Asuka 向前一步，一拳砸在铝制储物柜上。看到她只是愣住了，Asuka 又推了她一把以示鼓励。红发女孩在学校里名声在外，惹她发火可能会被揍的威胁可不是闹着玩的。

"Asuka!" Shinji yelled, reaching out to stop her. It was already too late. Erika spun on a heel and ran out of sight down the hall. He rounded on her. "Why'd you do that?"  
"明日香！" 真嗣大喊着，伸手试图阻止她。但已经太迟了。艾丽卡迅速转身，沿着走廊跑得无影无踪。他转向她，质问道："你为什么要那样做？"

"She was being annoying. Now come on." she grabbed his arm again and he yanked it free. Asuka kept marching ahead as though nothing had happened.  
"她太烦人了。快点走吧。" 她再次抓住他的手臂，而他猛地挣脱。明日香继续大步前行，仿佛什么都没发生过。

"She didn't do anything..." he sighed, trying and failing to hide the anger in his voice. Asuka was quiet, keeping several steps ahead of him so that all he saw was the sway of her hair. The walk across the courtyard and into the waiting Lexus was a blur, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. He didn't even want to sit in the same car with her and imagined himself turning down the street and going home on foot. That'd show her. It would land him in a world of trouble with Teacher, though. Before he knew it he was in the car anyway and they began the winding journey through Berlin.  
"她什么都没做……" 他叹息着，试图掩饰声音中的愤怒，但失败了。明日香沉默不语，始终保持在他前方几步之遥，他只能看到她头发的摆动。穿过庭院，坐进等候的雷克萨斯，这一切都显得模糊不清，他的双手紧握又松开。他甚至不想与她同乘一辆车，想象着自己转身走回家。那样会让她明白。但这会让他陷入老师的大麻烦中。不知不觉间，他还是上了车，他们开始在柏林蜿蜒前行。

Asuka took to looking out the window, silence reigning over the car and giving him ample time to stew. It startled him when her voice crept between them. "Why did you want to talk to her anyway?" she asked, apparently talking to the window since she couldn't be bothered to face him. The car jostled and Shinji stared down at his hands in his lap, fingers intertwining.  
明日香开始望向窗外，车内一片寂静，给了他足够的时间去沉思。当她的声音悄然在他们之间响起时，他吓了一跳。“你为什么想跟她说话？”她问道，显然是在对窗户说话，因为她懒得面对他。车子颠簸着，真嗣低头盯着腿上的双手，手指交缠。

"She seemed nice and I... I don't really have any friends here, so..."  
“她看起来不错，而我……我在这里真的没有朋友，所以……”

"You're stupid," she snapped, shifting.  
“你真蠢，”她厉声说道，挪动了一下身体。

Eyes narrowing, his body sagged and he set his gaze on the car door. "And you're just a bully," he mumbled, low enough so she wouldn't hear.  
他眯起眼睛，身体一沉，目光落在车门上。“你只是个欺凌者，”他低声嘟囔，声音小到她听不见。

The fifteen minute drive to the Langley estate was the longest in his life. When they finally pulled up, neither of them spared the other a glance as they took separate paths home.  
驱车前往兰利庄园的十五分钟是他一生中最漫长的时光。当他们终于抵达时，两人都没有看对方一眼，各自走上了回家的路。

---

Training at Gehirn became a bit of a formality. He and Asuka still rode there and back together, but there was no conversation or half-sincere teasing to be had. It was now a sort of compulsory activity that had to be endured before they could continue their normal routines without one another. Shinji refused to feel any guilt over what he'd said. Asuka was wrong and she had to know it. She was too smart not to realize how mean she'd been. It didn't really matter what he did though, she didn't care.  
在 Gehirn 的训练变得有些形式化。他和明日香仍然一起往返，但再也没有交谈或半真半假的调侃。现在这成了一项必须忍受的强制性活动，之后他们才能继续各自的生活，不再有对方的干扰。真嗣拒绝为他说过的话感到内疚。明日香错了，她必须知道这一点。她太聪明了，不可能意识不到自己有多刻薄。不过，无论他做什么，她都不在乎。

If they weren't going to be friends anymore, it was probably for the best. There were rules to their friendship that he always seemed to break, entirely because only Asuka was privy to the rules. Of course, it was perfectly fine for her to bend or twist those whenever it was convenient. Despite that, he always looked forward to seeing Misato and her smiles. It made the oppressive, tense air between him and Asuka easier to forget about.  
如果他们不再做朋友，或许也是件好事。他们友谊中的规则，他似乎总是无意间打破，而这些规则只有明日香知晓。当然，她可以随时随意地弯曲或扭曲这些规则。尽管如此，他总是期待着见到美里和她那灿烂的笑容。这让他和明日香之间压抑紧张的气氛变得容易忘记。

Over the course of the next two weeks Weissenburg taught them about standard operating procedure in the military, like radio etiquette, what words to use and in what order to say them to relay a certain message. Other days they learned how to dress wounds, anything from dehydration to a severed limb.  
接下来的两周里，魏森堡教他们军队的标准操作程序，比如无线电礼仪，使用哪些词汇以及按什么顺序说出来以传达特定信息。其他日子里，他们学习如何处理伤口，从脱水到断肢的各种情况。

On one particularly dry and humid day, Teacher led them to an open grass field, a wall of dirt at the far end. Waiting for them was Weissenburg, who had abandoned his uniform shirt in favor of something sleeveless and black. Next to him, Misato wore a camo tank top and short shorts, hair tied back while big reflective sunglasses hid her eyes.  
在一个特别干燥闷热的日子里，老师带领他们来到一片开阔的草地，远处是一堵泥土墙。等待他们的是魏森堡，他脱掉了制服衬衫，换上了黑色无袖上衣。他旁边的美里穿着迷彩背心和短裤，头发扎起，戴着大大的反光太阳镜遮住了眼睛。

He hadn't really noticed it before since Misato usually wore her military uniform, but in the tank top, her chest seemed... bigger. Or maybe it was simply because he could see more of it. That was when he noticed those sunglasses were turned towards him, and though he couldn't see her eyes, a smirk that claimed to know his inner thoughts poked at her pink lips.  
他之前并没有太注意到，因为美里通常穿着军装，但在那件背心下，她的胸部似乎...更大了。或许只是因为他能看得更清楚。就在这时，他注意到那副太阳镜正对着他，虽然看不见她的眼睛，但一个声称知道他内心想法的坏笑在她粉红色的唇边挑起。

"Alright you two," she said, a hand rising to adjust her red beret, "you're going to learn how to shoot today."  
"好了，你们两个，"她一边说，一边用手调整着红色的贝雷帽，"今天你们要学习如何射击。"

"We'll start with this," Weissenburg said, drawing a gun from the holster at his right hip. He knelt in front of them and turned the gun from side to side so they could see. It was all black with smooth slats and a sharp, squared design. "This is the Heckler and Koch P-eight, semi-automatic. The magazine holds fifteen nine-millimeter bullets." clicking something on the side, Weissenburg slipped the magazine from the handle, tugging one of the coppery bronze bullets out to show them. They were half the size of Shinji's index finger and rounded at the tip, though he had always imagined them being big and pointy. Weissenburg made a show of snapping the magazine back in place.  
"我们从这开始，"魏森堡说着，从右臀的枪套中抽出一把枪。他跪在他们面前，将枪从一边转到另一边，让他们看清楚。这把枪通体黑色，有着光滑的凹槽和锐利的方形设计。"这是赫克勒-科赫 P-8 型，半自动手枪。弹匣可装载十五发九毫米子弹。"魏森堡按下侧面的某个按钮，将弹匣从握把中滑出，抽出一枚铜色的子弹向他们展示。这些子弹只有真嗣食指的一半大小，且顶部是圆的，尽管他一直以为子弹会又大又尖。魏森堡故意将弹匣重新装回原位。

"Before we start, you have to understand that this is not a toy. It is a tool for killing and should always be treated with the utmost respect. Am I understood?"  
"在我们开始之前，你必须明白这不是玩具。这是一件杀戮工具，应当始终以最大的尊重对待。明白了吗？"

They both nodded and that seemed to satisfy him. Asuka was taken to one of the marked spots at the firing range with Weissenburg, while he and Misato took up a position adjacent. She pulled her own HK free, sliding rogue strands of hair from her face as she took a knee. "You hold it like this," she said, taking the gun in her right hand, index finger stretched out past the trigger guard, "you never want to put your finger over the trigger unless you're going to shoot. The safety's on, but you can never be too careful." with that she held it out to him and he hesitantly closed his hand around the ridged grip.  
他们俩都点了点头，这似乎让他满意了。明日香被带到射击场的一个标记点，与魏森堡一起，而他则和美里占据了相邻的位置。她拔出自己的 HK 手枪，将散乱的发丝从脸颊上拨开，单膝跪地。“你这样握枪，”她说着，右手握住枪，食指伸直越过扳机护圈，“除非准备射击，否则绝不要将手指放在扳机上。保险已经打开，但再小心也不为过。”说完，她将枪递给他，他犹豫地握住了那带有棱纹的握把。

"Woah," Misato gently pushed his arms away to face down range, "don't, uh, point that at people, okay?"  
"哇哦，"美里轻轻推开他的手臂，让他面向射击区，"别，呃，别把枪口对着人，好吗？"

"Sorry," he said. The gun was heavier than he expected and all of the wars and the battles they'd learned about in history class swam in his mind. Being so young and so new to the consequences of the thing in his hand, he couldn't help but wonder what it felt like to shoot someone with it. Just the thought of it made his throat sting as if packed with thorns.  
“对不起，”他说。枪比他预想的要重，所有在历史课上学到的战争和战役在他脑海中翻腾。作为一个如此年轻、对握在手中的东西的后果还如此陌生的人，他不禁想知道用它射击某人是什么感觉。仅仅是想到这一点，他的喉咙就像被荆棘填满一样刺痛。

Misato took it back for a moment, thumb flicking something while her other hand pulled back the top half. Apparently satisfied, she ticked another mechanism and offered it back to him before turning him to face the range. Up against the big dirt hill were white, people-shaped posters, a red circle in the middle of their chests, with a much smaller black dot in the center.  
美里拿回枪片刻，拇指拨动着什么，另一只手拉回上半部分。显然满意后，她又触动了另一个机关，然后递还给他，并让他面对射击场。在大土坡对面，是白色的人形海报，胸前有一个红色的圆圈，圆心是一个更小的黑点。

That was when he felt Misato press against his back while she lifted his arms. "Here, you want this hand to sit over the other for support – let your grip thumb sit on your support thumb too." she adjusted him like one might a doll, placing all his fingers in the right spot and bending his left arm while his right was straight and locked in place. "Squeeze the trigger, don't pull."  
就在这时，他感觉到美里紧贴在他背后，抬起他的双臂。“这里，你希望这只手放在另一只手上以获得支撑——让你的握枪拇指也放在支撑拇指上。”她像摆弄一个玩偶一样调整他，将他的手指放在正确的位置，弯曲他的左臂，而右臂则笔直并固定住。“扣动扳机，不要拉。”

"Yes, ma'am," he said, trying not to think about how very close Misato was. She settled a pair of big, padded headphones over his ears, which made them ring with white noise.  
“是的，女士，”他说，尽量不去想 Misato 离得有多近。她在他耳朵上戴了一副大而厚的耳机，耳中顿时充满了白噪音。

She pulled one headphone to the side. "Be ready for the recoil, okay?"  
她把一个耳机拉到一边。“准备好后坐力，好吗？”

He nodded, imagining he looked brave.  
他点点头，想象着自己看起来很勇敢。

"Don't worry, I'll be right here. You'll be okay – promise," Misato said, giving him one of those winks and readjusting his headset. Her hand slid over his, clicking off the safety.  
"别担心，我就在这儿。你会没事的——我保证，" 美里说着，给了他一个俏皮的眨眼，并调整了他的耳机。她的手滑过他的手，咔嗒一声关掉了保险。

Shinji closed his left eye, chest shivering as his heart thumped faster and faster. Time stretched over the next few seconds as he squeezed the trigger.  
真嗣闭上了左眼，胸口因心跳加速而颤抖。接下来的几秒钟时间仿佛被拉长了，他紧紧地扣下了扳机。

Even with the headphones on, the crack felt deafening. He staggered, wanting to drop the thing. Her grip stopped that from happening and she kept his arms held out as he pressed his back into her.  
即使戴着耳机，那声巨响也震耳欲聋。他踉跄了一下，想要扔掉那东西。她的紧握阻止了这一幕发生，她稳住了他的手臂，让他紧贴着她的背。

Her tongue clicked as she tugged his headphones off. "Hey, hey– look, it's okay – _look_."  
她咂了咂舌，拽下他的耳机。“嘿，嘿——看，没事的——看。”

Calming, he peered down the range, seeing that he'd hit the target wide of the red circle.  
他平静下来，顺着射击线望去，发现自己打偏了，没中红心。

"See? You're okay." “看吧？你没事的。”

Shinji practically jumped out his skin as another bang from Asuka's gun sounded. He saw her tongue sticking out of the side of her mouth, lining up another shot. He squinted to spot her target, flinching once more as her second shotskimmed the shoulder of its white silhouette.  
真嗣几乎被另一声明日香枪响吓得跳了起来。他看到她舌头从嘴角伸出，正在瞄准另一枪。他眯起眼睛寻找她的目标，当她的第二枪擦过白色轮廓的肩膀时，他又是一缩。

A nudge at his elbow drew him back. "Come on," Misato said with an impish smile, "let's see if you can get the rest on the mark."  
肘部被轻轻一碰，他回过神来。“来吧，”美里带着调皮的笑容说，“看看你能不能把剩下的都打中。”

As Shinji started getting used to the mild kick of the gun, Misato was able to let him fire without holding his arms. It made it harder to aim that way, but it was a rare few that didn't strike the target, and some even made it in the red mark.  
随着真嗣逐渐习惯了枪的轻微后坐力，美里不再需要扶着他的手臂。这样瞄准更困难，但很少有打不中目标的，甚至有些还打进了红心。

"No fair! how do you make it hit _every time_?!" Asuka cried, having impatiently fired as many bullets as she could – as fast as she could, most of them missing.  
“不公平！你怎么每次都能打中？！”明日香喊道，她急切地尽可能快地射出了所有子弹，但大部分都脱靶了。

The sun soon began to set. Shinji's hands and arms buzzed with numbness, the lingering sensation of gunfire coursing through his limbs. He and Misato sat on a bench off to the side of the range. Asuka had refused to be finished with the day's training until she had mastered the use of the sidearm. Weissenburg was not opposed in the slightest. She still missed a lot.  
太阳很快开始西沉。真嗣的手和胳膊感到一阵麻木，枪声的余韵在他的四肢中游走。他和美里坐在射击场旁边的一条长凳上。明日香拒绝结束今天的训练，直到她掌握了手枪的使用。魏森堡对此一点也不反对。她还是有很多没打中。

Misato was sitting next to him with her legs crossed, one knee bouncing. An elbow was propped atop one leg, arm holding up her chin as she leaned forward, bored.  
美里坐在他旁边，双腿交叉，一个膝盖不停地弹跳。她一只手肘撑在腿上，手臂托着下巴，身体前倾，显得有些无聊。

"Misato... why do we have to learn this stuff?"  
"美里...我们为什么要学这些东西？"

"Whaddya' mean, kiddo?" she asked, staring out over the gun range. A crack from Asuka's gun echoed.  
""你什么意思，小家伙？"" 她问道，目光越过射击场。明日香开枪的声音回荡着。

"I mean, don't only soldiers learn how to fire guns?"  
"我是说，不是只有士兵才学怎么开枪吗？"

The woman looked as though he had just electrocuted her. The bouncing of her leg stopped and her posture straightened as she slid those reflective glasses to the top of her head. "Well, uh..."  
那女人看起来像是刚被电击了一样。她抖动的腿停了下来，姿势也挺直了，将那副反光眼镜推到了头顶。“呃，这个……”

"Is there going to be a war?" he asked.  
“会有一场战争吗？”他问道。

Melancholy came like a shadow over her face. She turned her attention back to the gun range, a much older, unfamiliar Misato revealing herself. Nervousness wrapped around his stomach and he looked to his shoes. It scared him, more than he even wanted to think about. He knew they were supposed to be fighting something – that's why they were being taught how to use guns and knives and where to hurt people. But who and why? What could they be fighting that would make someone who always smiled look the way she did?  
忧郁如阴影般掠过她的脸庞。她将注意力转回射击场，一个更为年长、陌生的美里显露出来。紧张感缠绕在他的胃部，他低头看向自己的鞋子。这让他害怕，比他愿意承认的还要害怕。他知道他们应该是在对抗某种东西——这就是为什么他们被教导如何使用枪支和刀具，以及如何伤害他人。但对抗的是谁，又是为了什么？他们究竟在对抗什么，会让一个总是微笑的人露出那样的表情？

_Are we going to kill people?_ He wanted to ask.  
我们要去杀人吗？他想问。

"Hey," she said, voice quieter but summoning his eyes up nonetheless. "Soldiers fight to protect people, right?"  
“嘿，”她轻声说，尽管声音更小，却依然吸引他抬眼望去。“士兵们战斗是为了保护人民，对吧？”

"Yeah..." "是啊..."

She bit her lower lip. "One day... you're going to do something very important to protect mankind, so you need to be strong like a soldier is for when that time comes. Can you do that – for me, Shinji?"  
她咬了咬下唇。“总有一天……你会为了保护人类做出非常重要的事情，所以你需要像士兵一样坚强，以备那时所需。你能做到吗——为了我，真嗣？”

She didn't even have to ask. He would do anything she wanted if it meant she wouldn't look so sad anymore. "I'll try," he said, nodding.  
她甚至不需要开口。只要能让她不再那么悲伤，他愿意做任何她希望的事。“我会试试的，”他点头说道。

She smiled, the other Misato returning as she took her beret and planted it atop Shinji's head. "My brave little soldier, hm?"  
她笑了，另一个美里回来了，她拿起贝雷帽，戴在真嗣的头上。“我的勇敢小士兵，嗯？”

For once, he didn't mind being little Shinji.  
这一次，他并不介意成为小小的真嗣。

Swathes of coral red and pink clouds dragged across the sky like paint, fading orange light casting a warm glow over the garden. He sat on one of the many boulders encircling a large pond beyond the back porch and bed of white rocks. He and Asuka had often spent their afternoons tossing pebbles into it, scaring the koi fish that drifted gracefully between the reeds and lily pads. Their scales shimmered with yellow and orange, reflecting with the dimming rays of the sun. Most of them were easily the size of his forearm, mouths gasping at the surface of the water every now and then as they circled expectantly for food.  
大片珊瑚红与粉色的云朵拖曳过天空，宛如颜料般，橙色的光线渐淡，为花园披上一层温暖的辉光。他坐在后门廊外一个大池塘周围众多巨石中的一块上，他和明日香常常在午后将小石子投入池中，惊扰那些在芦苇与睡莲间优雅游弋的锦鲤。它们的鳞片闪烁着黄与橙的光芒，与日渐黯淡的阳光交相辉映。这些鱼大多有他前臂那么长，不时浮上水面张嘴呼吸，期待地绕圈等待食物。

Protecting mankind. That had to be as huge as the entire world. How was he supposed to protect something that big? It didn't make any sense. What could he be piloting that could do that? Shinji had spent the better part of the evening trying to think of ways he could protect a planet. He liked to think he'd come up with a lot of fantastic ideas for a nine year old. It was just getting adults to think they were good ideas too that was the trouble. Adults always thought they were so smart.  
保护人类。这使命之宏大，仿佛涵盖了整个世界。他该如何保护如此庞大的事物？这毫无道理。他能驾驶什么来完成这样的任务？真嗣整个晚上都在努力思考如何保护一个星球。他觉得自己作为一个九岁的孩子，已经想出了许多奇妙的点子。问题在于如何让大人们也认为这些想法不错。大人们总是自以为聪明。

There was the muffled crunch of rocks behind him, drawing his head around to Asuka as she vaulted up onto the boulder. She settled herself close to him, their hips touching as she dipped her feet into the water with his. The sky had been dyed shades of violet and pink like the Amaranthus flower in the rose garden, flecks of dying sunlight barely visible beyond an encroaching wave of deep-sea blue.  
身后传来岩石被压碎的沉闷声响，他转头望向明日香，只见她一跃而上，落在了巨石上。她紧挨着他坐下，两人的髋部相触，她将脚伸入水中，与他的一同荡漾。天空已被染成紫罗兰与粉红的渐变色，宛如玫瑰园中的苋菜花，夕阳的余晖在深海蓝的浪潮逼近下，仅剩点点斑驳可见。

When she settled her arms back and found the koi fish far more worthy of her acknowledgment, Shinji mulled over getting up and leaving. The thought scurried from his mind the same moment it arrived. Anger warmed him, upset more with himself for not being able to hate Asuka like he wanted. He bounced his feet in the pond, surprisingly not scaring any of the koi fish away. If anything they were excited at the prospect of food, only to be disappointed when it turned out to be feet. A few gave his toes a spiteful nibble before dashing away.  
当她收回双臂，发现鲤鱼更值得她关注时，真嗣思索着起身离开。这个念头刚一闪现便匆匆消散。愤怒温暖了他，更令他懊恼的是，自己竟无法像所期望的那样憎恨明日香。他在池中踢踏着双脚，出乎意料地没有吓跑任何鲤鱼。相反，它们对食物的期待被激发，却在发现只是脚时失望了。几条鱼不满地轻咬了他的脚趾，随即迅速游开。

"What were you talking with her about today?" Asuka asked, tone only mildly accusing.  
“今天你和她聊了些什么？”明日香问道，语气中仅带着一丝轻微的责备。

He considered not answering, just to spite her, but ended up shrugging. "About the stuff we're doing. She said that we're going to protect people by learning to fight."  
他本想不回答，只是为了气她，但最终还是耸了耸肩。“关于我们正在做的事情。她说我们要通过学习战斗来保护人们。”

A scoff. "Of course we are."  
一声嗤笑。“当然是我们了。”

"But why?" “但为什么呢？”

"What are you, stupid?" she asked, the venom from her bite absent. Her eyes followed the fish drifting idly by their feet. "We have to."  
"你是不是傻？" 她问道，语气中的毒辣不见了。她的目光随着脚边悠闲游过的鱼儿移动。"我们必须这么做。"

_We_. He thought. The buzzing, gnawing feeling of doubt that had been filling his thoughts the past month vanished, dissipating like rain water with the return of the sun.  
我们。他想着。过去一个月里充斥在他脑海中的那种嗡嗡作响、啃噬般的疑虑感消失了，就像雨水随着太阳的回归而消散。

Asuka muttered something and Shinji's head quirked. "What?" he asked and her face smarted.  
明日香咕哝了一句，真嗣的头微微一偏。"什么？" 他问，她的脸颊微微一红。

"I'm not a bully, I just..." she went quiet and guilt tugged at him like a pair of meat hooks in his ribs. She'd heard him in the car afterall. A stern expression made her seem years older as she stared into the water, shoulders hunched and eyes hard.  
"我不是欺负人，我只是..." 她突然沉默了，内疚像一对肉钩子般扯动着他的心。毕竟，她听到了他在车里的那些话。她严肃的表情让她看起来成熟了许多，她凝视着水面，肩膀紧绷，眼神坚硬。

Shinji shrugged. "You're... Asuka," he said, not knowing how else to put it.  
真嗣耸了耸肩。"你是... 明日香，"他说道，不知道还能怎么表达。

When he thought about it, there was rarely a time they were ever apart. Even at school, when she talked with her friends from her advanced sessions, he and Asuka always ended up together. While he knew what made her sad and he _definitely_ knew what made her angry – she was still this pent-up force that he could never predict. But she was Asuka. That was enough. The idea of her helping him protect the world didn't make it seem quite so daunting. He turned his head and found her staring at him, expression utterly unreadable.  
当他仔细回想时，他们几乎从未分开过。即使在学校的那些高级课程中，当她和她的朋友们交谈时，他和明日香总是会聚在一起。虽然他知道是什么让她难过，也肯定知道是什么让她生气——她仍然是一个他无法预测的压抑力量。但她就是明日香。这就足够了。想到她帮助他保护世界，这让他觉得没那么可怕了。他转过头，发现她正盯着他，表情完全难以捉摸。

"Asuka?" he asked. She leaned close enough for their noses to touch. He blinked, pulling back. "Asuka, what?"  
"明日香？" 他问道。她倾身靠近，两人的鼻尖几乎相触。他眨了眨眼，向后退缩。"明日香，怎么了？"

She smiled and said, "You're such a dork," before giving him a push that sent him flailing off the boulder.  
她笑着说："你真是个呆子，"然后推了他一把，让他从巨石上踉跄跌落。

"Ow– hey!" he shouted, scrambling to his feet. Asuka only laughed, leaping off the rock and running towards the garden. A big, goofy smile on his face, Shinji gave chase.  
"哎哟——嘿！" 他喊道，慌忙站起身来。明日香只是大笑着，从岩石上一跃而下，向花园跑去。真嗣脸上挂着傻乎乎的笑容，紧随其后追赶。

The lightning bugs were out that night, neon green and yellow streaks zipping through the pines and ferns while others lit up the branches above like an alien starry sky. They raced and tagged with the children, who pushed and wrestled in the soft grass as their laughter filled the lonely garden.  
那晚萤火虫飞舞，霓虹绿与黄的光迹穿梭于松林蕨丛间，而其他萤火虫则在上方枝头点亮，宛如异星的星空。它们与孩子们竞逐嬉戏，孩子们在柔软的草地上推搡打闹，笑声填满了孤寂的花园。

_Are you there God? It's me, Shinji.  
神啊，你在吗？是我，真嗣。_

_I know me and Asuka have to protect the whole world somehow, and I don't know what you want me to do about that, but I'm going to try. Just make sure Asuka doesn't get hurt too much, okay? I know she's mean, and I know she can hit hard and probably cares more about winning than any other girl, but I don't think she likes fighting. Not really.  
我知道我和明日香得用某种方式保护整个世界，虽然我不清楚你希望我怎么做，但我会尽力尝试。请确保明日香不要受太多伤，好吗？我知道她脾气不好，也知道她出手狠，可能比任何女孩都更在乎胜利，但我觉得她并不喜欢战斗。真的不喜欢。_

_So, if it's not too much to ask, I need you to make me strong. Otherwise, I can't protect anybody.  
所以，如果不算过分的话，我需要你让我变得强大。否则，我无法保护任何人。_

_Are you there God? 上帝，你在吗？_

### Chapter 7: Little Secrets
Just like when they used to play the roles of knight and princess, Asuka was indeed the ruler, or the Empress – as she called herself – of the Langley's grand garden. He was safe there. He was protected. The _Kloster_ wasn't the barbed, ominous school it had been when he was younger, but the memory of his strangeness, and a perceived special treatment he didn't actually get, every so often encouraged a group of boys to give him a reminder of just how unwelcome he really was. Eager to make sure he never got too comfortable.  
就像他们过去扮演骑士和公主的角色一样，明日香确实是这片兰格利大花园的统治者，或者如她自称的——女皇。在那里，他是安全的，受到保护的。克洛斯特不再是那个带刺、不祥的学校，就像他小时候那样，但他那奇怪的记忆，以及他并未真正得到的特殊待遇，时不时会激起一群男孩给他一个提醒，告诉他自己是多么不受欢迎。他们急于确保他永远不会感到太舒适。

They'd wait until Asuka became less vigilant, wait until she strayed from him at lunch breaks or inbetween classes. She couldn't stick by him all the time, not with her advanced studies. Neither could broad-shouldered Marcel's threats deter them indefinitely. Even if he, Heiko and Yani got even with them later on, the gang would just cry foul and everyone involved would wind up doing chores in the chapel after school.  
他们会等到明日香不那么警惕的时候，等到她在午餐休息或课间离开他的时候。她不可能一直陪在他身边，毕竟她还有高级课程要上。马塞尔宽阔的肩膀也无法永远吓阻他们。即使他和海科、亚尼后来报复了他们，那帮人只会大喊冤枉，最后所有涉事者都会在放学后在教堂做杂务。

So it wasn't much of a surprise that they'd caught him out by the tennis courts today – or that they'd outnumbered him five to one. He'd gotten pretty good at fighting under Weissenburg's instruction, but he couldn't fight five at once. Not by himself. At least one of them he knew by name. Günter. The kid he'd tackled in the mud his first week at the _Kloster_.  
所以今天他们在网球场逮到他并不令人意外——或者说他们五对一的优势也不足为奇。在魏森堡的指导下，他的战斗技巧已经相当不错了，但他无法同时对付五个人。至少他认识其中一个的名字。京特。那个在他刚到修道院第一周时被他在泥地里扑倒的孩子。

If this was a fair fight, Shinji probably could've beaten him to a pulp. But Weissenburg said there was no such thing as a fair fight.  
如果这是一场公平的战斗，真嗣或许能把对方打得鼻青脸肿。但魏森堡说过，世上没有所谓的公平战斗。

The first boy he knocked off their feet with his book-bag, the second he managed to catch across the face with a backhanded fist, while the third tackled him into the chainlink fence at his back. He broke the hold with a downward elbow, lashing out each time a foot or a fist crunched into him. After a few split lips and maybe a broken finger or two, the boys decided they'd landed enough hits to make their injuries worth while and scampered off.  
他用书包将第一个男孩击倒在地，反手一拳打在第二个男孩的脸上，而第三个则将他撞向身后的铁丝网。他用肘部向下猛击挣脱束缚，每当有脚或拳头击中他时，他都会反击。在几次嘴唇破裂和可能断了一两根手指之后，这些男孩认为他们已经造成了足够的伤害，值得撤退，于是便逃之夭夭了。

His shirt had been caught on a jagged metal link, ripping into his arm. He would have to go see Sister Cécile again. She would stitch the patch while eyeing him curiously and might even ask how he'd gotten his bruises.  
他的衬衫被一根参差不齐的金属链勾住，撕裂了手臂。他不得不再次去找塞西尔修女。她会一边好奇地打量着他，一边缝合伤口，甚至可能会询问他是如何受的伤。

"I don't know," he would say with a shrug, making her sigh in a sad way. Shinji thought of telling her the truth, but that would only make more trouble in the end.  
“我不知道，”他会耸耸肩说，让她以一种悲伤的方式叹息。真嗣想过告诉她真相，但那只会最终带来更多的麻烦。

Asuka found him with a bloodied nose and a spattering of bruises, sitting against the fence and staring up at the sky. She didn't say anything at first, swaying in place a moment while he did his best not to meet her eyes. He sniffed, smearing blood over his sleeve as he swiped it away, but smiling a little as he sat up.  
明日香发现他鼻青脸肿，坐在栅栏旁仰望天空。她起初什么也没说，只是站在那里摇晃了一会儿，而他尽力避免与她的目光相遇。他吸了吸鼻子，用袖子擦去血迹，虽然有些血迹斑斑，但还是微微一笑坐直了身子。

"It's not so bad," he said.  
"其实没那么糟，" 他说道。

Asuka kneeled next to him, loosening the red sash around her waist. Her eyes were somewhere far off in thought, face perhaps a bit too pensive. A quiet Asuka who, for a rare moment, had no scathing words or sharp commands. She tied it tight over the deep gash, allowing herself a pleased nod. They'd both been taught how to dress wounds, but Asuka knew better than anyone he didn't want to go to Sister Cécile – and they didn't have anything else to wrap it with.  
明日香跪在他旁边，解开腰间的红色腰带。她的目光似乎飘向了远方，神情略显沉思。一个少见的、没有尖刻言辞或严厉命令的明日香。她将腰带紧紧缠绕在深深的伤口上，满意地点了点头。他们都被教导过如何包扎伤口，但明日香比任何人都清楚，他不想去找塞西尔修女——而且他们也没有其他东西可以用来包扎了。

"There," she said, letting some life come back to her expression. "Now no one will know you're bleeding either."  
"好了，" 她恢复了一些生气，说道，"现在没人会知道你还在流血了。

He huffed a laugh, clinging to the fence to help get his feet. "Why would I care if they see me bleed?"  
他轻笑一声，紧紧抓住栅栏以稳住脚步。“我为什么要介意他们看到我流血？”

Asuka gripped his arm tight and he winced. "Cause then people will think you can't take care of yourself. Dummy." the last word was uttered as little more than a whisper, her hand falling back to her side. In the cherry tree across the way, a growing commune of crows complained as space became sparse and the line had to be moved to the power cables arcing over the road.  
明日香紧紧抓住他的手臂，他疼得皱眉。“因为那样人们会认为你照顾不了自己。傻瓜。”最后这个词几乎是耳语般吐出，她的手随即垂回身侧。不远处的樱花树上，一群乌鸦因空间拥挤而开始抱怨，队伍不得不移至横跨道路的电缆线上。

Shinji was off balance when she was like this, when she paused or stared or set herself in somber silence.  
每当这种时候，当她停顿、凝视或陷入沉思时，真嗣总是感到无所适从。

"I can take care of myself just fine," he said.  
"我完全可以自己照顾好自己，" 他说。

She snorted. "Yeah, right. You wouldn't last a day without me."  
她嗤之以鼻。"是啊，没错。没有我，你一天都撑不过去。"

"I don't need you to protect me," he sneered. "They'd beat me up either way."  
"我不需要你来保护我，" 他不屑地说。"反正他们都会揍我。"

"Maybe I should just let them from now on," she said, stabbing a finger into his wound.  
"或许从今往后我该任由他们去，" 她一边说，一边用手指戳进他的伤口。

_Like you could stop them_. "You wouldn't."  
就像你能阻止他们似的。"你不会的。"

"Would too!" "会的！"

"_Wouldn't!_" "才不！"

"_Yes. I._ _Would_ you big jerk!"  
"是的，我会的，你这个大笨蛋！"

The talk of the birds quieted and a stillness sat over the tennis courts, roaring Berlin traffic the only indication that the city was still alive. The arc of her eyebrows, balled up hands and tightness of her arms – all blatant warning signs to stop if he didn't want to get beaten up a second time – gave him pause. Long enough to see her as older, like she always wanted to look, like she always _did_ look, mustering such a threatening glare at only nine.  
鸟儿的议论声渐渐平息，网球场上笼罩着一片寂静，只有柏林川流不息的车流表明这座城市依然充满生机。她扬起的眉毛、紧握的双手和紧绷的双臂——所有这些都是明显的警告信号，如果他不想再次被打的话，最好停下来。这让他停顿了一下，足够让他看到她显得更成熟，就像她一直想展现的样子，就像她一直以来的样子，尽管只有九岁，却能散发出如此威胁的目光。

Shinji couldn't help it. He laughed.  
真嗣忍不住了，他笑了起来。

Asuka's face reddened and she pushed him – still stifling giggles – into the fence. When he calmed and she couldn't stand the sight of him anymore, she shouldered her pack and spun, all while he wondered, with mild amusement, what he had done this time.  
明日香的脸上泛起红晕，她推了他一把——还在强忍着笑意——把他推到了栅栏上。当他平静下来，而她再也受不了他的样子时，她背起背包，转身离开，而他则带着一丝轻微的愉悦，好奇这次他又做了什么。

In her marble green Volkswagon Polo, a headlight hanging loose as though the poor used car were shedding a tear, Misato picked them up from school and drove to Gehirn. It was a day for tests but thankfully without needles and hospital beds. They camped in her office while she asked them questions and recorded the answers along with notes into a computer that clicked and chugged, annoyed by Misato's slow, careful input. Shinji took the only other seat in the office by her desk and, while she whined and cursed, noticed an empty six pack of beer partially hidden behind a trash can under the table.  
在她的那辆大理石绿的福斯波罗轿车里，一个车灯松松垮垮地挂着，仿佛这辆可怜的二手车在流泪，美里从学校接他们去 GEHIRN。今天是测试的日子，但幸运的是没有针头和医院床位。他们在她的办公室里安顿下来，她向他们提问，并将答案连同笔记一起录入一台电脑，电脑发出咔嗒咔嗒的声音，对美里缓慢而谨慎的输入感到不耐烦。真嗣坐在她办公桌旁的唯一一把椅子上，当她抱怨和咒骂时，注意到桌子底下垃圾桶后面藏着一箱空的六罐装啤酒。

He was pretty sure that wasn't allowed, but would never tell on Misato – and assured her of as much. She didn't gush like he was hoping, saying, "That's nice," and continuing to glare at the screen. He was staring at her sun-warmed cheeks and eyeing the way her chest bounced whenever she huffed, trying to think of ways to get her attention – when Asuka nearly pushed him to the floor, claiming he had to share the seat. They argued, until he at last gave her half. That kept the peace for maybe a minute, and soon enough they were at it again.  
他很确定那是不被允许的，但绝不会告发美里——并向她保证这一点。她没有像他希望的那样激动，只是淡淡地说：“那很好。”然后继续盯着屏幕。他盯着她被阳光晒得暖洋洋的脸颊，留意到每当她生气时胸部都会随之起伏，试图想出吸引她注意的方法——这时，明日香几乎把他推到地上，声称他必须分享座位。他们争吵了一会儿，最终他让出了一半座位。这维持了大约一分钟的和平，很快他们又开始了争执。

Misato growled and waved them off, "_Get_ – and behave," she said, with that look she set on them whenever they weren't listening during training and Weissenburg wasn't there to scold them or box their ears. Well, Shinji's ears. He had never disciplined Asuka beyond a warning or two.  
美里咆哮着挥手让他们离开，“走开——然后乖乖的，”她说，每当他们在训练中不听话而魏森堡不在场责骂或敲打他们时，她就会用那种眼神看着他们。好吧，是敲打真嗣的耳朵。他从未对明日香进行过超过一两次的警告。

They ran to stand against the wall beside the door, seeing which of them was taller. Asuka was rather upset until she noticed his shadow on the wall and told him to hold still while she snatched a pencil from Misato's desk. Shinji waited and did as Asuka directed, smiling when she told him to puff out his chest and look tough. Tongue out, she started tracing the profile of his face on the wall.  
他们跑到门旁的墙边，比试着谁更高。明日香相当不高兴，直到她注意到墙上的影子，并让他在原地别动，然后从美里桌上抓起一支铅笔。真嗣等待着，按照明日香的指示去做，当她让他挺胸抬头、显得强硬时，他笑了。她伸出舌头，开始在墙上勾勒他的脸部轮廓。

As she finished, Lützow poked his head into Misato's office. "Lieutenant, Shinji," he said, nodding to each of them in turn, then, "come along now, Asuka."  
当她完成时，吕佐夫探头进入美里的办公室。“少尉，真嗣，”他依次向他们点头致意，然后说，“走吧，明日香。”

She straightened her hair, quieter again as she grabbed her pack and made for the door. Before she left, her gaze came around to regard him, looking up and down. Then she lunged forward to stab a finger into his wound, retreating just as suddenly and slamming the door shut.  
她整理了一下头发，再次安静下来，抓起背包向门口走去。离开前，她的目光转向他，上下打量了一番。随后她突然向前一冲，用手指戳向他的伤口，又迅速退回并猛地关上了门。

Shinji grabbed his arm, though the bite of it was almost pleasant, rubbing the area without thinking of anything but his shadow on the wall and how bored he was going to be now.  
真嗣抓住他的手臂，虽然那咬痕几乎带来一丝快感，他无意识地揉着那块地方，只想着墙上的影子以及自己现在会有多么无聊。

"What happened to your arm, Shinji?" Misato asked, rigid with concern.  
“你的手臂怎么了，真嗣？”美里问道，关切之情溢于言表。

"I got... cut. Asuka gave this to me," he said, patting the sash.  
“我被……割伤了。是明日香给我的。”他说着，拍了拍腰带。

There was a face Misato made whenever he did something she didn't like, which he hated. The edges of a smile stopped tickling the corners of her lips and her mouth became as flat as her stare. She set that look on him now.  
每当他做了她不喜欢的事，Misato 总会有一种让他讨厌的表情。嘴角那抹微笑的痕迹消失了，她的嘴变得和她的目光一样平直。现在，她正用那种眼神看着他。

He should've fought those boys harder. He should've won.  
他本该更拼命地和那些男孩打斗。他本该赢的。

"Come on, let's get that properly bandaged." he obeyed as she motioned him over, leaning on her elbows to be a little more level with him. Neither of them spoke as she unraveled the red sash, revealing the rough flesh and testing its torn edges with light brushes of her fingers. Reaching to grab a medical kit, she opened it in her lap and sifted for the rubbing alcohol.  
“来吧，让我们好好包扎一下。”他顺从地走过去，她用手肘撑着身体，以便和他更平视。她解开红色的腰带，露出粗糙的伤口，用手指轻轻触碰撕裂的边缘。她伸手去拿医疗包，打开放在腿上，寻找着消毒酒精。

"Why didn't you go to the nurse's office?" she asked, soaking a cotton ball. "Hm?" she set her eyes on him when he remained silent and he shrugged, admiring the contents of the kit.  
“你为什么不去校医室？”她问道，一边用棉球浸湿。“嗯？”当他保持沉默时，她将目光投向他，而他耸了耸肩，欣赏着药箱里的物品。

"I dunno'." “我不知道。”

Misato jabbed the ball to the gash and he hissed, the burn tickling every little nerve, each tiny receptor pleading to pull away. She was ruthless and efficient, dabbing every inch and swiping in some areas, until she was satisfied it was clean and that he'd squirmed enough. She rubbed antibiotic ointment smooth across and set a bandage over it, intent on her task. With that done, she wrapped the sash over it again with care.  
美里将棉球戳向伤口，他倒吸一口气，灼烧感刺激着每一根神经，每个微小的感受器都在恳求他避开。她冷酷而高效，轻拍每一处，擦拭某些区域，直到她满意地认为伤口已经清洁，而他已扭动得足够多。她均匀涂抹上抗生素药膏，并在上面贴上创可贴，专注于她的任务。完成后，她小心翼翼地再次用绷带包扎好。

"You know," she began, something of the playful tone he liked so much returning, "in medieval times, princesses used to tie a sash around the arm of their favored knight before they rode out to battle."  
"你知道吗，"她开口道，那种他特别喜欢的俏皮语气又回来了，"在中世纪，公主们会在她们心爱的骑士出征前，把一条丝带系在他的手臂上。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

"Because then the knight was obligated to return it to her." she smiled, tying off the knot. "It was a promise that they would meet again."  
"因为这样一来，骑士就有义务将它归还给她。"她微笑着打了个结，"这是一种承诺，他们一定会再次相见。"

Shinji contemplated the sash, which was done up in a neater fashion than Asuka had managed: smoothed of wrinkles and fit around just tight enough. The fabric itself was coarse on his finger tips.  
真嗣端详着那条丝带，它的打理比明日香之前做的要整洁得多：褶皱被抚平，松紧也恰到好处。布料在他指尖触感粗糙。

"Speaking of which..." Misato said, the tilt in her voice seizing his chest. "Do you have a girlfriend yet, Shinji?" she asked, leaning her chin on a fist and peering at him from beneath hooded eyes.  
"说到这个..." 美里说道，她语调中的倾斜抓住了他的心。"你已经有女朋友了吗，真嗣？" 她问道，下巴靠在拳头上，从半垂的眼帘下窥视着他。

Her smile grew as he blushed. "_No._ I-I mean, I don't really like any girls, so..." he couldn't keep the frustration from boiling out, or Erika from slipping into his thoughts.  
她看到他脸红，笑容更甚。"没有。我的意思是，我并不真的喜欢哪个女孩，所以..." 他无法抑制住内心的挫败感，也无法阻止艾丽卡溜进他的思绪。

Misato pouted. "Not even me?"  
美里撅起嘴。"连我也不行吗？"

"I do like you, but..."  
"我确实喜欢你，但是..."

"And what about Asuka?" "那明日香呢？"

"That's different," Shinji mumbled, tempted to sit on the opposite side of the room and refuse to talk to her. Then he scoffed. "She's barely a girl."  
"那不一样，" 真嗣咕哝着，很想坐到房间的另一边去，拒绝和她说话。然后他嗤之以鼻。"她几乎算不上是个女孩。"

Misato giggled, covering her mouth. "You'd better not let her hear that."  
美里咯咯笑着，捂住了嘴。“你最好别让她听到这话。”

Shinji, though silent, agreed – a wary eye on the door now.  
真嗣虽然沉默，但也表示同意——现在警惕地盯着门。

Misato caught up on her reports, some of which he knew must've been about him, but never asked. Asuka appeared around the same time, tugging on his sash to check underneath. Nodding, as if a mentor approving a student's work, she led the way out of Gehirn when Misato was finished.  
美里赶完了她的报告，其中一些他知道肯定与他有关，但从未问过。明日香差不多同一时间出现，拉扯着他的腰带检查下面。她点点头，仿佛导师批准学生的作业一般，在美里完成后领着他离开了 GEHIRN。

Once home, he chased her upstairs as she went to fetch charcoal sticks, and was then dragged back down to be puppeteered along the outside wall of the house. There, in the sunset, Asuka traced and filled his profile one more time.  
一回到家，他就跟着她上楼去拿炭笔，结果又被拽回楼下，像个木偶一样沿着屋外的墙走。在那里，在夕阳下，明日香又一次勾勒并填满了他的侧影。

---

Shinji sometimes thought of what it might feel like to die.  
真嗣有时会思考死亡的感觉会是什么样。

Each pounding step smashed through his heels a little harder, jarring his bones to settle as a growing ache in his hips. The pain, for a moment, let him forget he had to breathe. Until he gasped for air. The rifle in his hands slipped.  
每一步重踏都更狠地碾过他的脚跟，震得他的骨头在髋部形成越来越剧烈的疼痛。那一刻，疼痛让他暂时忘记了呼吸。直到他喘息着吸气。手中的步枪滑落了。

It probably felt a lot like this.  
这感觉大概就是这样。

"Come on, boy!" Weissenburg snapped, jogging alongside him. "Rifle against your chest, head _up_!"  
“快点，小子！”魏森堡厉声喝道，一边小跑着跟在他旁边。“把步枪紧贴胸前，头抬起来！”

Shinji did as he was told, the rifle seemingly a thousand pounds heavier and making each inch he lifted it unbearable. His combat uniform was soaked through and stuck to his skin and chaffed against his inner thighs. He was panting hard now, and had completely forgotten everything Misato taught them about keeping their breathing even, his rib-cage searing and his sides stinging like jabs from their electric knives.  
真嗣照做了，步枪仿佛重达千斤，每抬高一寸都让他难以承受。他的战斗服湿透了，紧贴在皮肤上，摩擦着大腿内侧。他现在喘得厉害，完全忘记了美里教他们的保持呼吸平稳的方法，胸腔像火烧一样，两侧像被电刀刺痛。

Lagging several feet behind, Asuka was faring little better, struggling more to keep pace than anything else. Weissenburg announced they only had a hundred yards to go on their run. It was such good news Shinji almost cried.  
阿斯卡落后几英尺，情况也好不到哪儿去，主要是努力跟上步伐。魏森堡宣布他们跑步只剩下一百码了。这消息好得让真嗣几乎要哭出来。

Rubber scuffed the asphalt of the road as Asuka tripped, the weight of her vest throwing her momentum. She staggered to keep her feet and Shinji reached back, hooking a hand under her arm and pulling her along with him, thankful that she was far too tired to refuse or say something nasty. He wasn't even spared a resentful look, but when Asuka caught her pace she nearly fell again shoving him away.  
阿斯卡绊了一下，背心的重量打乱了她的节奏，橡胶摩擦着路面。她踉跄着试图稳住脚步，真嗣回头，伸手勾住她的胳膊，拉着她一起前进，庆幸她累得没法拒绝或说些刻薄的话。他甚至没得到一个怨恨的眼神，但当阿斯卡调整好步伐时，她几乎再次摔倒，猛地推开了他。

Days like this made Shinji hate all of their training.  
这样的日子让真嗣讨厌所有的训练。

He didn't mind Misato's sharp criticism during CQC or Weissenburg's barking commands while they practiced with firearms. Anything from pistols, to rifles, and once a heavy caliber. Even if some were harder to use and made his arms ache. Anything was better than running and drilling.  
他对美里在近身格斗训练中的尖锐批评并不介意，也不反感魏森堡在练习枪械时的大声命令。无论是手枪、步枪，还是一次重口径武器，即便有些更难使用，让他的手臂酸痛。任何训练都比跑步和操练要好。

When Weissenburg was sure each of them could dismantle his myriad of weapons and put them back together without incident and clear jammed casings without smashing their fingers or blowing their faces off – he had announced it was time to start firing under stress.  
当魏森堡确信他们每个人都能熟练拆卸并重新组装他那各式各样的武器，且能安全排除卡壳弹壳而不伤到手指或炸伤自己时，他宣布是时候开始在压力下进行实弹射击了。

Shinji had never thought about how heavy a tactical vest was until he'd been made to run a few miles in it. He was old enough now to have his own camo green uniform, made with heavy fibers that weighed ten pounds on their own. Misato, trailing behind them, said normal soldiers did it in 90 pounds. To Shinji, 40 was still far too much.  
真嗣从未想过战术背心会如此沉重，直到他被要求穿着它跑上几英里。他现在已到了拥有自己迷彩绿军装的年纪，这套由厚重纤维制成的制服本身就重达十磅。跟在他们后面的美里说，普通士兵要穿着 90 磅的装备进行训练。对真嗣来说，40 磅依然太过沉重。

At last they reached the firing range and Weissenburg bellowed, "First target: prone – three rounds!"  
终于，他们到达了射击场，魏森堡大声命令道：“第一个目标：俯卧——三发！”

He and Asuka practically fell to their stomachs and Shinji fumbled, forgot to brace his carbine, stopped, checked his magazine and realized he still had the safety on. Asuka's rifle reported and Shinji took his first shot without aiming down the sights. The round puffed into the sand wall behind the target. His second shot hit with a satisfying _ding_, but missed the red marker. His third shot he let fly before his muzzle came all the way down and the round clipped the edge of his target. Asuka shot her third round a long moment after his and he heard the faintest of hits.  
他和明日香几乎是扑倒在地，真嗣手忙脚乱，忘了支撑他的卡宾枪，停下来，检查弹匣，才发现保险还没打开。明日香的步枪响了，真嗣没有瞄准就开了第一枪。子弹在目标后方的沙墙上扬起一阵尘土。他的第二枪令人满意地叮了一声，但偏离了红色标记。他的第三枪在枪口完全下压之前就射出，子弹擦过了目标的边缘。明日香在他之后很久才射出第三发，他听到了最轻微的击中声。

Weissenburg ordered them up.  
魏森堡命令他们起身。

Shinji, pausing as he again forgot to click the safety, had his rifle yanked to face the ground. "Goddammit boy – muzzle down! You know what _down_ means?!"  
真嗣，又一次忘记打开保险，被猛地拽着枪口朝下。“该死的，小子——枪口朝下！你知道朝下是什么意思吗？！”

Embarrassment burned him and Shinji thought about throwing the damn gun at Weissenburg's feet. Instead, ragged gasping in his ears, he jogged down the range to where Misato was standing.  
尴尬感灼烧着他，真嗣想着把那该死的枪扔到魏森堡脚边。然而，耳边是急促的喘息声，他沿着射击场小跑向美里站立的地方。

"Kneeling position, two targets, four rounds!"  
“跪姿，两个目标，四发子弹！”

Shinji collapsed to a knee, checked safety, aimed down sights, took two breaths, and squeezed. First shot hit. He waited for the muzzle to settle this time, and struck center. He shifted aim, fighting to concentrate with the crack of Asuka's rifle beside him, rattling over his already shaking nerves. First shot hit, second shot hit. No center. Shinji was to the point that he didn't care. So long as he made a hit, Weissenburg wouldn't lecture him much.  
真嗣单膝跪地，检查了保险，瞄准目标，深吸两口气，然后轻扣扳机。第一枪命中。这次他等待枪口稳定下来，再击中中心。他调整瞄准点，努力集中注意力，身边明日香步枪的响声震得他本已颤抖的神经更加紧张。第一枪命中，第二枪也命中。没有击中中心。真嗣已经到了不在乎的地步，只要能命中，魏森堡就不会过多训斥他。

When they had run the length of the range and spent their magazines, only then were they allowed to fall to the grass, where Shinji was certain he was melting, and painstakingly try to recompose. Misato handed them water and he choked trying to chug, spitting some of it up on his already wet shirt. The woman didn't scold him as she had in the past for his haste. She walked out to the field with Weissenburg to inspect the targets, her gait slack.  
当他们跑完整个射击场，打完所有子弹后，才被允许倒在草地上，真嗣确信自己正在融化，并费力地试图重新调整状态。美里递给他们水，他急切地大口喝着，呛得咳嗽，一些水喷到了他早已湿透的衬衫上。女人没有像过去那样因为他急躁而责备他。她和魏森堡一起走到靶场检查靶子，步伐显得有些懒散。

Asuka finished her water, sat with her legs crossed and glared at the field, the cicadas speaking between them. The shuddering impact of his rifle buzzed in his arms now that he was still. Their instructors finished their inspection. Misato stared at him the way she had in her office days before, and he knew he must have done poorly. They were herded to the lockers deep in Gehirn again. Asuka still said nothing. She was tired, he reasoned.  
明日香喝完了水，盘腿坐着，瞪着操场，蝉鸣在他们之间回响。他的步枪震动带来的冲击感在他静止后仍在他手臂中嗡嗡作响。教官们完成了检查。美里用之前在办公室里那种眼神盯着他，他知道自己一定表现得很糟糕。他们再次被赶到位于 GEHIRN 深处的更衣室。明日香依旧一言不发。他想，她累了。

Shinji peeled out of his vest and uniform, which ended up piled on the floor in a gruesome murder of cloth and stitchery. He showered, reveling in the steam and coolness of the white tiled walls. He closed his eyes so that it was dark and warm. Time drifted to the pattern of water beating on his skin and the scream of the nozzle, the drill rolling in a thunder with it. His heart rate was still coming down, muscles oozing down to his feet. He ran through the drill again and again, hating each iteration. _Safety. Brace. Target. Fire. Breathe. Target. Fire. Safety. Stand._  
真嗣脱下背心和制服，结果它们堆在地上，像是一场布料和缝线的惨烈谋杀。他洗了个澡，享受着蒸汽和白色瓷砖墙的凉爽。他闭上眼睛，让四周变得黑暗而温暖。时间随着水滴打在皮肤上的节奏和喷头的尖叫声流逝，雷鸣般的训练声随之滚动。他的心率仍在下降，肌肉缓缓松弛到脚底。他一遍又一遍地回想着训练过程，每一遍都让他心生厌恶。安全。支撑。目标。射击。呼吸。目标。射击。安全。站立。

So many mistakes. 如此多的错误。

_Safety. Brace. Target. Fire. Breathe. Target. Fire. Safety. Stand–  
安全。准备。目标。开火。呼吸。目标。开火。安全。站立——_

A buzzer rang. The water flow stopped and Shinji didn't remember curling up and lying on the floor. He dried and dressed hurriedly, leaving his combat gear behind. The day settled in his mind and stumped any thoughts of effort. He didn't care if Misato reprimanded him for it. He'd already disappointed her.  
蜂鸣器响起。水流停止了，真嗣不记得自己蜷缩起来躺在地板上。他匆忙擦干身体并穿上衣服，留下了战斗装备。这一天在他脑海中沉淀，阻碍了任何努力的想法。他不在乎美里是否会因此责备他。他已经让她失望了。

Out in the main corridor, everyone was waiting on him and Weissenburg was palpably annoyed. Misato, still, regarded him in a way he couldn't read, but made the walls taller and the air colder. Asuka didn't punch him or give him a sneer, only started walking with their instructors, barely allotting him a glance as he moved in step alongside her.  
在主走廊外，所有人都在等他，魏森堡明显感到不耐烦。美里仍然用一种他无法解读的眼神看着他，这让他感到墙壁更高，空气更冷。明日香没有打他或嘲笑他，只是开始与他们的教官一起走，几乎没给他一个眼神，他便与她并肩而行。

Already seated in the conference room was a woman with short, choppy hair, calculating eyes latching onto him. Her baggy blue uniform made it seem like she was slouching, but she simply looked relaxed, and gave them a small smile. Shinji remembered her and the way her eyes pinched like someone from the east. Bolkovac, as her nametag read, didn't look particularly asian or european. She was somewhere inbetween, like Asuka.  
会议室里已经坐着一位短发参差不齐的女性，计算般的目光紧锁在他身上。她宽松的蓝色制服让人感觉她有些驼背，但实际上她只是显得很放松，并给了他们一个浅浅的微笑。真嗣记得她，以及她那双像东方人一样微微眯起的眼睛。她的名牌上写着“博尔科瓦克”，看起来既不像亚洲人也不像欧洲人，介于两者之间，就像明日香一样。

He'd known her since two months ago when the UN appointed her to, in her own words, "ensure the training program is maintaining UN ethical standards." then she'd winked at Weissenburg, "just in case."  
自从两个月前联合国任命她来，用她自己的话说，“确保训练计划维持联合国伦理标准”，那时她还对魏森堡眨了眨眼，“以防万一。”

The man, as he did with everyone, tried to treat her as part of the scenery. But Shinji watched the woman step into his space, put their shoulders centimeters apart, tease at his cold exterior. She got along well with Misato too, fluent in Japanese. With the Captain, it was different, and he began to notice the way the German soldier's shoulders relaxed when she was near. The quiet conversations they shared while he and Asuka drilled.  
他对每个人都一样，试图把她当作背景的一部分。但真嗣注意到这位女性走进他的空间，肩并肩地站着，挑逗他冷漠的外表。她和美里相处得也很好，日语流利。与队长在一起时则不同，他开始注意到当这位德国士兵在她附近时，肩膀会放松下来。在他们和明日香训练时，他们之间那些安静的对话。

Something about that had changed. Today, Weissenburg didn't acknowledge her and she, with her small, wistful smile, did the same.  
有些事情已经改变了。今天，魏森堡没有理会她，而她，带着那抹小小的、渴望的微笑，也同样没有回应。

The Captain sat them down and reviewed their performance. Asuka had missed most of her marks. Shinji had scored plenty of hits, but very few at the center of mass. Misato said they would be performing the drill every week until they felt their scores were passable. She was rigid and withdrawn, mimicking the man at her elbow, who, instead of sounding perpetually displeased, adopted a quieter tone as he spoke.  
队长让他们坐下，回顾了他们的表现。明日香错过了大部分目标。真嗣虽然击中了不少，但大多数都没有打中要害。美里说他们会每周进行这个训练，直到他们觉得自己的成绩可以接受为止。她显得僵硬而疏离，模仿着她身边的男人，那人不再总是显得不满，而是用一种更平静的语调说话。

"It wasn't bad for your first run," he said, arms crossed. "The key to this exercise is to ensure you're able to return fire quickly and accurately when under duress."  
“第一次能做到这样已经不错了，”他双臂交叉说道，“这项训练的关键在于，在压力下能够迅速准确地进行反击。”

Shinji frowned and kicked his feet. He was just barely tall enough for the tips of his shoes to touch the floor. "How will this help us pilot?"  
真嗣皱了皱眉，踢了踢脚。他的身高勉强能让鞋尖触到地板。“这怎么能帮我们驾驶呢？”

"It isn't to help you pilot," Misato said, failing at a smirk. "These exercises are to grow you accustomed to combat conditions."  
“这不是为了帮你驾驶，”美里说，试图露出微笑却失败了。“这些训练是为了让你适应战斗环境。”

"Fine, can we go now?" Asuka asked, slouching in her seat. Weissenburg motioned up with his hand and, after a bout of glaring, she obeyed. They were dismissed, but all that really meant was Misato was going to drive them home now. The Captain and Bolkovac stayed behind.  
“好吧，我们现在可以走了吗？”明日香坐在椅子上懒洋洋地问。魏森堡举手示意，经过一番瞪视后，她顺从了。他们被解散了，但这实际上只意味着美里现在要开车送他们回家。卡普兰和博尔科瓦茨留了下来。

It would be seven o'clock by the time they reached the estate and Asuka might fall asleep compiling notes while he studied for tomorrow's test.  
等他们到达庄园时，已经是七点钟了，明日香可能会在整理笔记时睡着，而他则在为明天的考试复习。

They climbed the ramps out of the underground warehouses and Shinji snared a glance of a woman's submachine gun, though he couldn't say which model. When he had turned 10, a lot of things he was still trying to figure out had happened. They each saw Lützow scantly these days and were given actual security I.D. cards to get in like the adults. Day by day the man looked increasingly haggard and sleep-deprived.  
他们爬上从地下仓库出来的坡道，真嗣瞥见了一个女人的冲锋枪，虽然他无法说出型号。在他十岁那年，发生了许多他仍在努力理解的事情。如今他们很少见到吕佐夫，而且像成年人一样，被发放了真正的安全身份证件。日复一日，那个人看起来越来越憔悴，睡眠不足。

"We're very close," he'd say, sporting a grin that, on him, looked manic. "Yes, very close now, Shinji."  
“我们非常接近了，”他会这么说，露出一个在他脸上显得狂热的笑容。“是的，非常接近了，真嗣。”

Inside Gehirn there were armed guards – not like the old ones who were more akin to pudgy police officers – but full-fledged soldiers dressed in tan while sporting red berets, rifles slung around their shoulders. Since then, the place was constantly under construction, halls and rooms sealed off by tarps while power tools blared. The warehouse they trained in never really changed, though Gehirn itself began to flood with other people – scientists, soldiers, technicians. Everywhere he went there was a big red leaf cut down the middle by the letters NERV – a saying about God arcing under it.  
在 Gehirn 内部，有武装警卫——不像以前的那些更像是胖胖的警察——而是穿着卡其色制服、戴着红色贝雷帽、肩上挎着步枪的正规士兵。从那时起，这个地方一直在不断建设中，走廊和房间被防水布封住，电动工具的轰鸣声不绝于耳。他们训练的仓库几乎没有变化，但 Gehirn 本身开始涌入其他人——科学家、士兵、技术人员。无论他走到哪里，都能看到一个大红叶被 NERV 字母从中劈开——下面有一句关于上帝的话。

As they left Shinji noticed how Misato stared at the road on the drive home. Her face hadn't changed much since the drilling. That wasn't Misato. She was always smiling or teasing him about something.  
离开时，真嗣注意到美里在开车回家时一直盯着路面。她的脸自训练以来几乎没有变化。那不是美里。她总是微笑着，或者拿他开玩笑。

"Misato, what are we piloting? How come no one can tell us?" he asked, hoping to stir her out.  
“美里，我们在驾驶什么？为什么没人能告诉我们？”他问道，希望能唤醒她。

She tried on another smirk, like earlier, and it stuck. "It's a very big machine – and because it's very secret."  
她又尝试了一次那种讥笑，就像之前那样，这次成功了。“这是一台非常大的机器——而且因为它非常机密。”

"_I_ already told him that," Asuka said from the front seat. They hadn't fought over it today. But only because he'd lost that battle the minute he'd come out of the showers and seen the look on her face. Not just any look, but _the_ look. The one that said "_best watch where you step_".  
“我已经告诉他了，”明日香从前座说道。他们今天没有为此争吵。但这仅仅是因为他从淋浴间出来那一刻就看到了她脸上的表情。不仅仅是任何表情，而是那个表情。那个意味着“最好小心脚下”的表情。

Shinji ignored her. "How big?"  
真嗣无视了她。“有多大？”

"Taller than the Treptower," Misato said.  
"比特雷普托的雕像还要高，"美里说。

Bigger than a skyscraper! How could he ever move something that big? Was that why he had to be strong like a soldier?  
比摩天大楼还要大！他怎么能移动那么庞大的东西呢？难道这就是他必须像士兵一样强壮的原因吗？

Before he could ask, Misato perked up. "Hey, It'll be Valentines day soon, you know."  
在他能问出口之前，美里突然来了精神。"嘿，情人节快到了，你知道吧。"

Valentines day. Misato's prodding about girls made all the more sense now. Shinji had once seen Herr Langley come into the house with an armful of roses, though not from the garden, and a heart-shaped ginger bread cookie bigger than his chest. When he'd asked Teacher about it, since they'd only briefly gone over the tale of Saint Valentine in school, he was told that such things were an adult affair and he had no business knowing.  
情人节。美里对女孩子的打探现在看来更有道理了。真嗣曾见过兰格雷先生带着一捧不是从花园摘的玫瑰花回家，还有一个比他胸口还大的心形姜饼。当他向老师询问这件事时，因为他们只在学校里简略地学过圣瓦伦丁的故事，老师告诉他这些都是成年人的事情，他没必要知道。

On the occasional walks to the S-bahn from school he saw a few storefronts packed with fat little pigs offering flowers and laying down chocolates. Asuka said those and the four leaf clovers were for luck. With them were piles of big cookies that said things like, 'my treasure' or 'I love you'.  
偶尔从学校走到 S-Bahn 的路上，他会看到几家商店的橱窗里堆满了胖乎乎的小猪，它们提供鲜花和巧克力。明日香说那些和四叶草都是为了带来好运。还有一堆堆的大饼干，上面写着'我的宝贝'或'我爱你'之类的字样。

"What do people do on Valentines day?" he asked.  
“人们在情人节都做些什么呢？”他问道。

"They hug and kiss and stuff. Don't you know that?" Asuka said, sticking her tongue out and trying to bat at him over the seat. He stayed where he was, knowing she couldn't reach. Her struggling intensified.  
"他们拥抱和亲吻之类的，你不知道吗？" 明日香说着，伸出舌头，试图越过座椅去拍打他。他站在原地不动，知道她够不着。她的挣扎加剧了。

Misato patted her on the head and she whined, but sat straight.  
美里拍了拍她的头，她发出抱怨声，但还是坐直了。

"Well," she said, jerking them back between the lines on the road. "In Japan, girls give boys chocolates."  
"嗯，" 她一边说，一边将车稳稳地开回道路标线之间。"在日本，女生会给男生送巧克力。"

"I thought boys were supposed to give girls love letters and things like that?" Asuka said, crossing her arms.  
"我以为男生应该给女生写情书之类的呢？" 明日香说着，交叉双臂。

"It's a little different back home. Boys only give girls chocolates on White Day in March."  
"在我们家乡有点不同。男生只在三月的白色情人节给女生送巧克力。"

"That's dumb." "那真蠢。"

Shinji had already stopped listening once Asuka mentioned kissing. He didn't like thinking about those things, not really. Adults kissed, which meant Misato kissed. Other people. Other not-ten-year-olds. He thought instead of last summer when they went to Saalburg with her for SonneMondSterne festival. Asuka had gotten in trouble with her dad again, so he made Misato take them both out to the countryside. She'd, at first, seemed very annoyed, making one-worded grunts when he tried to talk to her on the car ride there.  
真嗣在听到明日香提到接吻时就已经走神了。他并不喜欢去想这些事情，真的不喜欢。那是大人们才会做的事，意味着美里也会亲吻别人。那些不是十岁小孩的人。他转而回忆起去年夏天，他们和美里一起去萨尔堡参加 SonneMondSterne 音乐节。明日香又惹她爸爸生气了，所以他让美里带他们俩去乡下散心。起初，美里显得相当不耐烦，在去那儿的路上，每当他试图和她搭话，她都只是用单音节的哼声回应。

She was better once they arrived, pulling into a parking lot on a sandy hilltop, where they could see the endless horde of other cars stretching across the banks. They helped set up a tent in a sea of others, swarming with people, some of them Misato's age, sporting red eyes and reeking of beer. There weren't really a lot of kids that he saw, except the ones from the town nearby. It sat along a river that bulged into a lake, where the shoreline was flooded with swimmers. The water there was freezing, even in Summer. Ever since Second Impact, winters and snow only came to northern Germany, but it was colder for longer come August through February. Thuringia, which was a little farther south, was only a few degrees warmer. Shinji brought along a portable stove from home and made soup.  
当他们抵达后，她感觉好多了，驶入山顶一片沙地上的停车场，那里可以俯瞰到河岸上绵延不绝的其他车辆。他们在一片帐篷海中帮忙搭起一个帐篷，周围人潮涌动，其中有些和美里年龄相仿，眼睛通红，浑身散发着啤酒味。他没看到太多孩子，除了附近镇上的那些。这里依傍着一条河，河水汇入湖泊，湖岸边挤满了游泳者。那里的水即使在夏天也冰冷刺骨。自从第二次冲击后，德国北部只有冬季才会下雪，但从八月到二月，天气会变得更冷。更南一些的图林根州，也只是稍微暖和几度。真嗣从家里带了一个便携式炉子，煮了汤。

At night there was music and light that splashed blue and purple over everything. The thumping beat was so loud they couldn't hear eachother talk, but they didn't need to to dance. Shinji didn't know anything about dancing, he just moved around a lot. The music demanded it. Asuka danced too, just as flailing and goofy as him.  
夜晚，音乐响起，蓝紫色的灯光洒满一切。那震耳欲聋的节拍让他们无法交谈，但跳舞并不需要言语。真嗣对跳舞一窍不通，只是随着音乐不停地移动。音乐要求如此。明日香也跳了起来，动作和他一样笨拙滑稽。

Misato made friends with their tent-neighbors, despite only being able to manage grasping attempts at German. He remembered she wore a bikini most of the trip, which he was never able to look at for very long since Asuka always wanted to play. Misato didn't care much so long as they stayed together and didn't leave the camp. So, of course, he and Asuka had snuck out at the first opportunity. They ran barefoot through a town called _Kloster_, up to where the river was thinner.  
尽管只能勉强尝试着用德语交流，美里还是和帐篷旁边的邻居们交上了朋友。他记得她大部分时间都穿着比基尼，但他总是不敢多看，因为明日香总是想玩耍。美里并不介意，只要他们待在一起，不离开营地就行。所以，当然，他和明日香一有机会就偷偷溜了出去。他们赤脚跑过名叫克洛斯特的小镇，一直跑到河面较窄的地方。

Teenagers from the hostel over the hill were racing to see who could reach the other bank first. Asuka and Shinji got close to their little troop and watched, while the older kids regarded them with brief, dismissive looks. Occasionally, they would splash water at them and Asuka would retaliate in kind. Soon enough they migrated across the river and that was fine by Shinji.  
来自山丘上青年旅舍的青少年们正在比赛，看谁能最先到达对岸。明日香和真嗣靠近他们的小队伍，在一旁观看，而大孩子们只是短暂地瞥了他们一眼，便不屑一顾。偶尔，他们会向他们泼水，明日香也会以同样的方式回击。很快，他们就穿过河流，这对真嗣来说正合适。

He didn't go out very far into the water anyway, where it was darker and he couldn't see the bottom. Not until Asuka spotted a log drifting along the easy current, way out in the middle. She paused at the border where the light sand met the seaweed. Where unknown terrors lurked. Across the way, the teenagers hollered and jeered.  
他并没有走得太远进入水中，那里水更深，他看不见底部。直到明日香发现一根木头顺着平缓的水流漂浮在河中央。她在浅滩与海藻交界的地方停了下来。那里潜伏着未知的恐怖。对岸，青少年们大声呼喊，嘲笑不已。

So when Asuka dove out into the river, he had no choice but to follow if he didn't want to be left in the shallows. The water grew colder as they swam, gasping for air like fish as they grabbed hold of the log. Asuka had gotten there first and tried to gloat between each breath. Something slithered along his toes and he managed to fight down a yelp.  
所以当明日香一头扎进河里时，他别无选择，只能跟着，以免被留在浅滩上。随着他们游泳，水变得越来越冷，他们像鱼一样喘着气，抓住了那根木头。明日香先到了那里，试图在每次呼吸之间炫耀。有什么东西滑过他的脚趾，他设法忍住了惊叫。

Two boys and a girl swam out to the log and threw themselves over it too.  
两个男孩和一个女孩也游向那根木头，扑了上去。

"Bet I can hang on longer than you," Asuka said.  
“我敢打赌，我能比你坚持得更久，”明日香说。

"Betcha' can't," a blonde boy said, shaking his wet hair and showering them in icy sprinkles. Asuka kicked water at him and he started trying to reach over and slap her hands on the wood to make her let go.  
"你肯定做不到，"一个金发男孩说，甩动着他湿漉漉的头发，冰冷的水珠四溅。明日香朝他踢水，他开始试图越过木板拍打她的手，让她松开。

"Hey, that's cheating!" she cried, scuttling further down and demanding he do something. Shinji scowled and lunged at the boy.  
"嘿，那是作弊！"她喊道，急忙向更远处爬去，要求他做点什么。真嗣皱起眉头，向那男孩扑去。

"Hey, cut it out!" he shouted. The blonde swatted a hand at his. Shinji fumbled, but caught the boy's wrist and pulled the attached fingers towards his face, intent to bite. But the teenager was stronger, and after a moment of panic, tugged free.  
"嘿，住手！"他喊道。金发男孩挥手打向他的手。真嗣踉跄了一下，但还是抓住了那男孩的手腕，将他的手指拉向自己的脸，准备咬下去。但那少年更强壮，片刻的慌乱后，他挣脱了。

Really, it was the boy's friend that got him to stop more than anything. His build was bigger and he whacked the blonde on a shoulder.  
说真的，是那男孩的朋友让他停手的，主要是因为朋友的体格更大，他拍了拍金发男孩的肩膀。

"Come on, dude, don't be a dick."  
“拜托，伙计，别这么混蛋。”

A glare was shared, and that was that.  
两人互瞪了一眼，事情就这样结束了。

He wasn't sure how long they drifted, but at some point he'd stopped being able to feel his legs, and then his hands and arms. What came after was a lot of sputtering and flailing in the water. Asuka was shouting something, hands grabbing his waist. For a moment, he thought they were both going to drown at the bottom of the river. At least until there was sand on his face. Warmth, a body near him. Someone struggling for air, so hoarse it hurt to listen to.  
他不确定他们漂了多久，但不知何时起，他已经感觉不到自己的双腿，接着是双手和双臂。之后是一阵在水中的喷溅和挣扎。明日香在喊着什么，双手抓住他的腰。有那么一刻，他以为他们俩都要在河底溺死了。至少直到他的脸颊触碰到沙子。温暖，一个身体靠近他。有人在艰难地呼吸，声音嘶哑得让人听着都疼。

That night they'd huddled in the tent with their only towel, sniffing and shivering. Misato was too busy enjoying their tent-neighbor's grill to have noticed much where they went. The front flap was open, letting them watch as fireworks popped over the lake. Even with Asuka pressed up beside him, he wasn't warm. They were both damp to the bone.  
那晚，他们蜷缩在帐篷里，裹着唯一的毛巾，抽着鼻子，颤抖着。美里正忙着享受隔壁帐篷的烧烤，没怎么注意到他们的去向。帐篷的前帘敞开着，让他们可以看着湖面上绽放的烟花。即使明日香紧贴在他身边，他也不觉得温暖。他们俩都湿透了。

"I could've won if I didn't have to save you," she said once her teeth stopped clattering.  
“如果不是为了救你，我本可以赢的。”她牙齿不再打颤后说道。

"But then you'd be sick all by yourself."  
"但那样你就只能一个人生病了。"

"Shut up," she said. Then, folding away from him, "make me soup."  
"闭嘴，"她说。然后，背对着他蜷缩起来，"给我做点汤。"

Grandma Ilka's visits were getting shorter and longer between. She tried to come in the Summer, when it was warmer and Asuka wouldn't be held up by school. But his friend was always at the _Kloster_ now, taking extra courses and extra tests.  
伊尔卡奶奶的来访越来越短，间隔也越来越长。她尽量在夏天来，那时天气暖和，而且学校放假不会让明日香被学业耽搁。但他的朋友现在总是在修道院，参加额外的课程和考试。

She didn't talk so well with Ilka anymore.  
她和伊尔卡不再那么畅谈了。

"Do you have any boyfriends? A nice catholic boy, maybe?" she asked this visit, carefully. Someone nudging a dwindling fire with their toe.  
“你有男朋友吗？或许是个不错的天主教男孩？”这次拜访时她小心翼翼地问道，就像有人用脚尖轻拨着即将熄灭的火堆。

Asuka flared. "No, and why would I care if they're catholic? That's stupid."  
明日香怒气冲冲地说：“没有，我为什么要在乎他们是不是天主教徒？那太蠢了。”

Ilka sighed, her hurt and disappointment filling Shinji with guilt, even though he hadn't said anything at all. She tried asking Asuka about her studies, or what they did at NERV, which made her groan.  
伊尔卡叹了口气，她的受伤和失望让真嗣感到内疚，尽管他什么都没说。她试图询问明日香关于学业的事，或者他们在 NERV 的工作，这让明日香发出了呻吟。

"I told you _Oma_, I can't talk about that with you."  
“我告诉过你，欧玛，我不能和你谈论这些。”

Shinji thought this visit might go better than the last, but he also thought Ilka wouldn't have asked about boyfriends or anything like that. He wondered if _Oma_ would still come for Christmas next month, and whether or not she would bring presents. Every year she came with something for each of them, and his were always a toss up since she never really knew what to get him.  
真嗣原以为这次拜访会比上次顺利，但他也没料到伊尔卡会问起男朋友之类的事。他不知道欧玛下个月圣诞节还会不会来，以及她是否会带礼物。每年她都会为他们每人准备一份礼物，而他的那份总是难以预料，因为她从来不知道该给他买什么。

This time she'd brought Shinji a sketch pad and conte crayons. He'd never liked coloring much, the exception being Asuka's chalks on the back patio. But that usually devolved into a fight to color more space than the other – creating jagged bricks of red battling blue – once driving Herr Langley into a lecture that ended with both of them spending the afternoon washing it off. That had also ended with a soap fight, and they were split up for a day.  
这次她给真嗣带来了一本素描本和粉彩棒。他向来不太喜欢涂色，除了在露台上用明日香的粉笔涂鸦。但那通常会演变成一场争夺更多涂色空间的战斗——红色和蓝色的锯齿状砖块相互对抗——直到把兰格先生惹恼，最后以一场关于礼仪的训话告终，结果是他们俩整个下午都在清洗那些涂鸦。那次也以一场肥皂大战收场，之后他们被分开了一天。

Still, he thanked Ilka for the gift, acting the proper boy she thought he was. They sat in the same living room he'd fist met her and felt so out of place in. It was more a second home now, albeit with nicer things he often feared bumping into and breaking.  
尽管如此，他还是对伊尔卡的礼物表示了感谢，表现得像个她心目中的乖男孩。他们坐在他第一次见到她时感到格格不入的客厅里。如今这里更像是一个第二故乡，尽管里面的东西更精致，他常常担心不小心碰到弄坏。

This year, Ilka hadn't bothered with a present for Asuka.  
今年，伊尔卡没费心给明日香准备礼物。

Her parents came in after a long bit of silence, suggesting they go outside and play for a bit. They'd done little more than sit by the patio steps and wander the rose bushes before going back. Asuka hovered at the edge of the door, just beyond sight. Puzzled, Shinji followed her lead, listening. She stared hard at nothing.  
在长时间的沉默后，她的父母提议他们出去玩一会儿。他们除了在露台台阶旁坐了一会儿，又在玫瑰丛中徘徊了一阵，就回去了。明日香在门口边缘徘徊，刚好超出视线范围。困惑中，真嗣跟着她的脚步，倾听着。她凝视着虚空。

"I don't know what to get the girl," Ilka complained. Glasses clinked on the coffee table. "She throws out everything I bring her..."  
“我不知道该给那女孩买什么，”伊尔卡抱怨道。咖啡桌上的眼镜叮当作响。“她把我带给她的每样东西都扔掉了……”

Mila sighed, and Shinji could imagine her head shaking. "She's always been that way. I've tried asking her what she wants, but... she says she doesn't need presents, and rarely keeps what we give her."  
米拉叹了口气，真嗣能想象她在摇头。“她一直都是这样。我试着问她想要什么，但是……她说她不需要礼物，而且很少保留我们给她的东西。”

"It's this insistence that she's too grown up for those things," Herr Langley said. "Children shouldn't be like that."  
"她总是坚持说自己已经长大了，不适合那些东西，" 兰格先生说。"孩子不应该这样。"

Ilka didn't seem to hear him. "And what about her faith, Mila? Doesn't she pray anymore?"  
伊尔卡似乎没听到他的话。"那她的信仰呢，米拉？她现在还祈祷吗？"

"Yes, every night. Or at least the nights I check on her. She won't even let me go in her room now. I know she only prays so I'll leave her alone about it."  
"是的，每晚都祈祷。或者至少在我检查她的那些晚上。她现在甚至不让我进她的房间。我知道她只是祈祷，这样我就会不再打扰她。"

"It's because the protestants who run that school of hers are so lax about it. You should be more strict with the Sunday services," Ilka said, clicking her tongue. "She would take it more seriously if you did."  
"这是因为管理她那所学校的基督新教徒们对此太宽松了。你应该对主日礼拜更严格些，"伊尔卡说，咂了咂舌。"如果你这么做，她会更认真对待的。"

Shinji heard clothes shifting, then Herr Langley spoke again. "No, she wouldn't. Asuka has her own mind for things. She'd just throw another tantrum if we tried to make her go."  
真嗣听到衣物摩擦的声音，然后兰格利先生再次开口。"不，她不会的。明日香有自己的想法。如果我们试图强迫她去，她只会再闹一场。"

Mila's voice was quiet. "She scares me sometimes."  
米拉的声音很轻。"她有时让我害怕。"

Asuka grabbed his arm and yanked him along, back to the garden. They holed up in his room for the rest of the day, even when Ilka came looking for her. Asuka refused to acknowledge she was even there, and Ilka ended up calling a strangled goodbye from the front door.  
明日香抓住他的手臂，拽着他回到花园。他们一整天都躲在他的房间里，即便伊尔卡来找她。明日香拒绝承认她在那里，伊尔卡最终在前门喊了一声窒息般的再见。

"You shouldn't throw away her gifts," Shinji said, just about hoping he wasn't heard.  
“你不该扔掉她的礼物，”真嗣说，几乎希望自己没被听到。

Asuka was all too focused on her video game. "Things won't be different just because they buy me stuff," she said, and they didn't talk about it anymore.  
明日香全神贯注于她的电子游戏。“他们买东西给我并不会让事情有所不同，”她说，之后他们就没再谈论这件事。

Her birthday came and went. Shinji found himself in Misato's office again, waiting on Asuka's return. When he told her how the girl hadn't gotten anything, Misato made a thoughtful noise.  
她的生日来了又去。真嗣发现自己再次坐在美里小姐的办公室里，等待着明日香的归来。当他告诉她那个女孩什么也没收到时，美里发出了一声沉思的声响。

"Maybe you should get her a gift," she said, turning.  
“也许你应该给她买个礼物，”她转过身来说道。

"Asuka?" he balked. "But she doesn't like getting presents."  
“明日香？”他有些惊讶。“但她不喜欢收礼物。”

That prompted an incredulous look. "You don't think she'd like getting a present from you?"  
这引来了难以置信的表情。“你不觉得她会喜欢你送的礼物吗？”

"She... she isn't like that..."  
“她……她不是那样的……”

Misato shrugged. "You know best," she said, in a tone that suggested he very well did _not_ know best. She slid over to him on her rolling chair and produced a 500 euro bill, pinched between her fingers. Stuffing it into his shirt pocket, she patted his chest, smiled, and went back to work.  
美里耸了耸肩。“你最清楚，”她用一种暗示他其实并不最清楚的语气说道。她滑到他身边，用滚轮椅，夹在手指间的一张 500 欧元钞票递给他。塞进他的衬衫口袋后，她拍了拍他的胸口，微笑着，又回去工作了。

At first, he thought of all the things he could get for himself with it. A Playstation of his own maybe, so Asuka wouldn't be able to lord ownership over him whenever he wanted to be first player. Or he could buy a bike, that green one sitting on display in Riken's shop off 23rd. He thought a lot about that, even stood in the store some days and stared at it, hand in his pocket over the money.  
起初，他想到了用这笔钱能为自己买些什么。或许一台属于自己的 Playstation，这样每当他想先玩时，Asuka 就不能以所有权为由压他一头。或者他可以买辆自行车，就是 Riken 位于 23 号街的店里展示的那辆绿色自行车。他对此想了很多，甚至有几天站在店里，手插在口袋里握着钱，盯着它看。

But that wouldn't have been right. He could practically feel Misato's disappointment, and that wasn't worth one silly bike. So, what to get Asuka? He agonized over it for weeks.  
但那样做是不对的。他几乎能感受到 Misato 的失望，那不值得为一辆愚蠢的自行车。那么，该给 Asuka 买什么呢？他为此苦恼了数周。

A few days after her birthday, he went up to her room, as he often did before they left for the _Kloster_. She was still brushing her hair when he walked in. They only had five minutes before it was time to go, but she was a master of scheduling and used every available minute.  
在她生日后的几天，他像往常一样在她出发去 Kloster 之前去了她的房间。他走进去时，她还在梳头。他们只剩下五分钟就要出发了，但她是个时间管理大师，充分利用每一分钟。

"Here," he said, putting the present on her vanity table, wrapped in the red sash she'd given him. Asuka put her brush down, eyeing him, and it, suspiciously. He shrugged, secretly trembling as she unraveled the thing, a sharp reply on the tip of her tongue. At least until she took in the small pair of orange sapphire earrings.  
"给，" 他说着，将礼物放在她的梳妆台上，用她给他的红色丝带包裹着。明日香放下梳子，怀疑地看着他和那件东西。他耸耸肩，暗自颤抖，因为她正解开那东西，一句尖锐的反驳已到嘴边。至少在她看到那对小小的橙色蓝宝石耳环之前。

"They were supposed to be pink, like the lilacs," he said, feeling like an idiot.  
"它们应该是粉色的，像丁香花一样，" 他说，感觉自己像个傻瓜。

Asuka didn't say anything. She put one in at each lobe, turning her head to inspect them in the mirror, where his head poked in sight at her shoulder.  
明日香什么也没说。她在每个耳垂上戴了一个，转过头来在镜子里检查它们，他的头在她肩旁探出视线。

"I didn't need a gift, dummy," she said, snatching her backpack and leading them downstairs.  
“我不需要礼物，傻瓜，”她说着，抢过她的背包，领着他们下楼。

Asuka was her usual self then, but didn't call him names or try to trip him out by the soccer fields – for a whole day at least – and that was unsettling. She spoke less, withering and moody, and Shinji wondered why he had even bothered. He saw her wearing the earrings everyday anyway. In a teasing manner, he asked her why she kept them if she didn't like them, to which she shrugged and suggested she might flush them down the toilet.  
那时，明日香还是老样子，但没有骂他或试图在足球场上绊倒他——至少一整天都没有——这让人不安。她话少了，变得萎靡和情绪化，真嗣不知道自己为何还要费心。他看到她每天都戴着那些耳环。他以一种调侃的方式问她，既然不喜欢为什么还留着，她耸耸肩，暗示可能会把它们冲进马桶。

Shinji managed to keep a straight face. "Bet you won't."  
真嗣努力保持面无表情。“我打赌你不会。”

In a sense, he called her bluff. She threw them in the pond instead.  
从某种意义上说，他揭穿了她的虚张声势。她反手就把它们扔进了池塘。

He spent every following afternoon trying to find them, combing the soft sands and bed rocks and giving the koi little fishy heart attacks, until it became too dark to see much of anything. Many times he thought of just giving up. One week later, he left them in a small envelope under her door and she wore them the next day to school.  
之后的每个下午，他都在努力寻找它们，仔细搜寻柔软的沙地和岩石床，给那些锦鲤带来了小小的鱼儿心脏危机，直到天色太暗，几乎什么都看不见。许多次他都想放弃。一周后，他把它们放在一个小信封里，留在了她的门口，第二天她戴着它们去了学校。

She never tossed them away again. Even when he, inevitably, prodded the fire once more, prompting a storm of bickering that had Asuka covering her earlobes and trying very hard to pretend he was on another planet – though she never took them out.  
她再也没有把它们扔掉。即使他不可避免地再次挑起争端，引发了一场激烈的争吵，让明日香捂住耳朵，努力假装他在另一个星球——尽管她从未摘下它们。

---

It was the last day of the _Karnival der Kulturen_ and Asuka was hot on his heels every step he took, badgering him in a way Mrs Langley once described to her husband as 'cute'. Shinji thought it was nothing of the sort.  
今天是卡尼瓦尔·德·库伦的最后一天，明日香紧随其后，每走一步都对他纠缠不休，兰利太太曾这样形容她的行为：‘可爱’。真嗣却不以为然。

"Hurry up! What's taking you so long?"  
“快点！你磨蹭什么呢？”

Toothbrush hanging out of his mouth, Shinji scrubbed one-handed, the other stuffing extra clothes into his backpack. He made a retort that was lost in the foam.  
牙刷挂在嘴边，真嗣单手擦洗，另一只手往背包里塞额外的衣物。他咕哝了一句反驳，却被泡沫淹没了声音。

"How much stuff does a boy need anyway?" she demanded at the doorway, hands on her hips. Seated in the living room, Teacher didn't look up from his tea.  
“一个男孩到底需要多少东西？”她站在门口质问道，双手叉腰。坐在客厅里的老师没有抬头，依旧品着他的茶。

Asuka had planned the excursion down to the minute, and they were well behind schedule. It wasn't Shinji's fault there had been a traffic jam on the way home. All he could do was scramble to meet her demands, before she shouldered her pack and tugged him out by the tie. No time to change out of his school uniform, then.  
明日香已经把这次出行计划到了每一分钟，而他们显然已经严重落后于预定时间。这并非真嗣的错，回家的路上遇到了交通堵塞。他只能匆忙应对她的要求，在她背起背包并拽着他领带出门之前。连换下校服的时间都没有。

They ran down the main road and into Bernau proper, taking the S-bahn into Berlin. Any sitting room was already taken since they'd just barely made the train out. Shinji's sleeve actually got caught between the closing doors. So they had to stand, hanging onto the hand rails. Everyone was going out to the _Karnival_, and that's what made him nervous. Shinji couldn't fight it, not that he wanted to, but Asuka had, on what seemed a whim, decided they would be going earlier that year. It wasn't a command so much as a decision she was making for both of them, and Asuka had been looking forward to it for months.  
他们沿着主干道跑进伯尔瑙市区，乘坐城铁前往柏林。由于他们刚刚勉强赶上火车，所有的座位早已被占。真嗣的袖子甚至被关闭的车门夹住了。因此他们只能站着，抓住扶手。每个人都在前往卡尼瓦尔，这让他感到紧张。真嗣无法抗拒，也不是他想要抗拒，但明日香似乎一时兴起，决定他们今年要提前去。这与其说是一个命令，不如说是她为他们两人做出的决定，而明日香已经期待了几个月。

Rolling through Berlin, they transferred at Badstrasse and rode the old U-bahn line across the Oberbaum bridge, arching over the Spree river to Kreuzberg. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the rooftops and colored the window panes. It speared through the maple trees and cast a golden halo around every head of hair crowding the streets, while children their age played over the grass plots set ablaze in the afternoon.  
他们穿过柏林，在 Badstrasse 换乘，乘坐古老的 U-bahn 线路横跨 Oberbaum 桥，拱形越过施普雷河到达克罗伊茨贝格。深秋的夕阳余晖覆盖着屋顶，染彩了窗玻璃。阳光穿透枫树，在拥挤的街道上每个人的发丝周围投下金色的光环，而同龄的孩子们则在午后被阳光点燃的草地上嬉戏。

They walked through the Mehringplatz, a double-tiered ring of housing and restaurants, to find the restrooms. Music reached them from across the plaza. Asuka disappeared for what felt like a lifetime, so long that Shinji jumped when he heard her ask, "Did I do it right?"  
他们穿过 Mehringplatz，一个双层环形住宅和餐馆区，寻找洗手间。音乐从广场对面传来。Asuka 消失了好久，久到 Shinji 听到她问“我做得对吗？”时吓了一跳。

She stood next to him in a kimono, or a yukata – he couldn't remember the difference. It was red, with white blossoms sprouting from thin, golden branches. The band around her stomach was yellow, tied off at her side where she could reach it better.  
她站在他旁边，穿着和服或浴衣——他记不清区别了。那是一件红色和服，白色花朵从细金枝条上绽放。腰间的带子是黄色的，在她便于触及的一侧打结。

"I think so," he said, feeling very under dressed. "What'd you put it on for?"  
"我想是的，" 他说，感觉自己穿得太随便了。"你为什么要穿这个？"

She held her arms out, sleeves drooping. "Lots of people dress up."  
她张开双臂，袖子垂落。"很多人都会盛装打扮。"

"You could've told me," he said, heated. "That way I could've gotten one too."  
"你本可以提前告诉我的，" 他有些激动地说。"那样我也能准备一套了。"

Auska's lips drooped and she started off. "You just would've complained the whole time."  
飞鸟的嘴唇下垂，她开始走开。“你只会全程抱怨。”

"_No._" Shinji said, making a face.  
“不。”真嗣说，做出一副表情。

"_Yes_," she pushed him, but walked close, decidedly less enthusiastic about her choice of outfit. Larks twittered overhead.  
“是的，”她推了他一下，但走得很近，显然对自己的着装选择不那么热情。云雀在头顶啁啾。

"It looks nice," he said eventually, and she glowered, knowing he was only saying it 'cause he felt guilty.  
"看起来不错，"他最终说道，而她瞪了他一眼，知道他这么说只是因为他感到内疚。

Still, Asuka wasn't one to pass up a compliment. "I made Misato get it for me," she said, and proceeded to tell him all about how the woman didn't understand color schemes very well.  
尽管如此，明日香可不是会拒绝赞美的人。"我让美里给我买的，"她说着，接着向他详细讲述了美里对色彩搭配有多么不在行。

Standing atop her tall column, Victoria watched them pass, holding her laurel up for all of Berlin to see. Her copper skin had turned green over the years, her robes marred by streaks of black.  
站在高高的柱子上，维多利亚注视着他们经过，高举着她的月桂枝，让整个柏林都能看见。她的铜色皮肤经过多年已变成绿色，长袍上留下了黑色的条纹。

They crossed the Landwehr Canal, hurrying along with sporadic herds of people until they bunched up at the crosswalks, making Shinji feel more and more like a penguin as they shuffled forward, inch by inch. Asuka, with him in tow, shoved her way past hairy legs, bulging purses and plastic strollers. When they made it out, up on the window shelf of a place called Little Tibet, he took in a lungful of fresh air.  
他们穿过了兰德维尔运河，匆匆前行，与零星的人群汇成一群，直到在人行横道前挤作一团，让真嗣感觉自己越来越像一只企鹅，一寸一寸地挪动着。明日香拉着他，挤过毛茸茸的腿、鼓鼓囊囊的包和塑料婴儿车。当他们终于挤出来，站在一家名为“小西藏”的店铺窗台上时，他深深吸了一口新鲜空气。

"What's that?" he asked, pointing to a big, hulking creature with horns and a snarling face. Asuka, failing to yank his arm down, pressed herself against the glass as it noticed them.  
“那是什么？”他指着一个长着角、面目狰狞的庞大生物问道。明日香试图拉下他的手臂却未能成功，只好紧贴着玻璃，因为那生物注意到了他们。

"Dummy, now it's coming over here!" she cried, clinging to his arm and kicking at it as the thing got close. "Go away, go away!"  
“笨蛋，现在它过来了！”她哭喊着，紧紧抓着他的手臂，一边踢打一边喊道，“走开，走开！”

Shinji just laughed, and when it turned back with the crowd, was just about pushed off the ledge by a fuming Asuka.  
真嗣只是笑了笑，当人群再次涌动时，几乎被气急败坏的明日香推下了台阶。

A beat thumped through the trees and hummed along the glass of store fronts, shaking his ribs with a pulse that could have come from deep within the earth. All around the cherry trees were in bloom, sprouting little fluffy white patches of cloud drifting through the streets. Throngs of thirteenth graders sat along the top of the vine trellises like eager crows, cawing in their slang-riddled tongue over the crowd, hands overflowing with frothing beers.  
一阵节奏穿透树林，沿着商店橱窗的玻璃回响，震动着他的胸腔，那脉动仿佛源自地心深处。四周的樱花树正盛开着，街道上飘荡着一团团柔软的白色云朵。一群十三年级的学生像急切的乌鸦一样坐在藤架顶上，用夹杂俚语的口音对着人群叫嚷，手里满是冒泡的啤酒。

Confetti fluttered down to them, tossed from the apartment balconies above and sprinkling the paraders with flecks of red, gold and green. Tan women with curling brown hair wearing huge, bright feathers on their backs – and only the barest amount of clothing – sauntered by. Others swirled about in frilly dresses stitched with elaborate patterns of birds and flowers. Roses and daffodils woven into their headdresses. Kids their age, faces painted with streaks and patterns he couldn't place, came marching down beating small black drums. The boys, sporting red and beige robes. The girls opting for gold and black.  
五彩纸屑从上方的公寓阳台飘落，洒向游行者，点缀着红、金、绿的斑点。一些肤色黝黑、卷发披肩的女性，背上插着巨大的鲜艳羽毛，几乎只穿着最少的衣物，悠闲地走过。其他人则身着饰有复杂鸟兽花卉图案的蓬松裙子，旋转起舞。他们的头饰上编织着玫瑰和黄水仙。同龄的孩子们脸上画着难以辨认的条纹和图案，敲打着小黑鼓列队行进。男孩们身着红褐色长袍，女孩们则选择金黑色装扮。

Then came the paper dragons, curling over the crowds and cutting a path for a troop of Samurai, ornate helmet crests poking above the sea of heads. Shinji followed them until he had to lean and stretch on his toes to see. He hadn't thought there were any other Japanese people in the country but for him and Misato. Silly, now that he thought of it.  
随后出现了纸龙，蜿蜒穿过人群，为一群武士开辟道路，华丽的头盔羽饰在人头攒动中若隐若现。真嗣跟着他们，直到不得不踮起脚尖才能看到。他原以为这个国家除了他和美里之外没有其他日本人了。现在想来，真是傻。

"My dad tells me about Japan sometimes," Asuka said as they disappeared. She hopped down off the window sill, and Shinji followed.  
“我爸爸有时会跟我讲日本的事，”明日香在他们消失后说道。她从窗台上跳下来，真嗣紧随其后。

"I thought he was from America?" he asked, watching as she fished in her yukata.  
“我以为他是美国人？”他问道，看着她在浴衣里摸索。

"He was stationed in Saitama for a while at Camp Asaka. He said that's what made him think of my name." she pulled out a few small bills, and groaned. When she held out her hand, and the expected coins didn't appear in it, she faced him fully and bounced her hand. _Gimme_.  
"他在埼玉县的朝霞营地待过一段时间。他说那让他想起了我的名字。" 她掏出几张小额钞票，叹了口气。当她伸出手，预期的硬币却没有出现时，她完全转向他，晃了晃手。给我。

Shinji shrugged, looking away.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，目光移开。

She stamped a foot and pouted. "Shinjiiii!" she whined.  
她跺了跺脚，噘起嘴。"真嗣——！" 她抱怨道。

His head rolled with his eyes, and he made a show of tugging the coins from his pocket and plopping them into her palm. She smiled, and they worked their way to one of the food stalls, where Asuka purchased a bag full of cinnamon sweet churros.  
他头一歪，眼神随之转动，夸张地从口袋里掏出硬币，啪嗒一声放进她的掌心。她微笑着，两人一同走向其中一个小吃摊，在那里，明日香买了一袋满满的肉桂甜油条。

Shinji waited until she finished stuffing one down to ask, "So what does he talk about?"  
真嗣等到她塞完一根油条后才问："那么，他都聊些什么呢？"

"Huh?" “啊？”

"Your dad." “你爸爸。”

"Oh, mostly about _Kami_," she said, still with a mouthful. "And the Buddhist stories."  
"哦，主要是关于神道教的神灵," 她嘴里还塞着食物说道，"还有佛教的故事。"

Shinji nodded, stuffing his hands in his pockets. A group of people, not dressed in costume, danced to the beat of hand held drums, swaying their arms, shirts tied like turbans around their heads. He'd been reading more and more about his home country's myths, which was a nice break from the usual Greek or Roman tales, even if they were just as strange. He certainly preferred them to the fairy tales Sister Cécile was so fond of sharing, like the story of the boy who let his finger nails grow, only to be beaten in his sleep by the villagers for it. Or the girl who sucked on her thumb, just for it to get cut off with a giant pair of scissors.  
真嗣点点头，把手插进口袋。一群没有穿戏服的人随着手持鼓的节奏跳舞，挥动着双臂，衬衫像头巾一样绑在头上。他越来越多地阅读关于自己国家的神话，这比平常的希腊或罗马故事要好，尽管它们同样奇怪。他当然更喜欢这些，而不是塞西尔修女喜欢分享的童话故事，比如那个因为留长指甲而在睡梦中被村民殴打的男孩的故事。或者是那个因为吮吸拇指而被一把巨大的剪刀剪掉拇指的女孩的故事。

They passed by a church, flanked by two tall spires with the same weathered green as the statue of Victoria. It stood guard before a graveyard, closed off by walls splashed with graffiti. Shinji liked reading about Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi. Or their brother Susanoo, the storm god of Summer.  
他们经过一座教堂，两侧是两座高耸的尖塔，与维多利亚雕像一样历经风霜的绿色。它守护着一片墓地，墓地被涂满涂鸦的墙壁封闭。真嗣喜欢阅读关于天照大神和月读命的故事。或者是他们的兄弟须佐之男，夏天的风暴之神。

"Teacher told me about this old couple, during feudal times," he said. Asuka was still wolfing churros.  
"老师跟我讲过一对老夫妇的故事，在封建时代，"他说道。明日香还在狼吞虎咽地吃着吉事果。

"When?" she asked, bits of fried dough tumbling free.  
"什么时候？"她问道，炸面团屑纷纷掉落。

"Like with Samurai and stuff."  
"就像武士之类的。"

Asuka wiped her face with the sleeve of her yukata. "Yeah, but what period?"  
明日香用浴衣的袖子擦了擦脸。“是啊，但具体是哪个时期？”

"Kamakura? I don't know. But this couple didn't have any children, just a dog. One day it dug in their garden and found a box full of gold. Their neighbor thought it could find treasure, so he borrowed the dog."  
“镰仓时代？我不太清楚。但这户人家没有孩子，只有一条狗。有一天，狗在他们花园里挖到了一个装满金子的盒子。邻居认为它能找到宝藏，于是就借走了那条狗。”

"Why'd they let him borrow it?"  
“他们为什么让他借走狗呢？”

"They just did, okay? When it dug in his garden, all it found were bones, so the neighbor killed the dog and told the couple it had just dropped dead. They cried and buried it under the fig tree where they had found the gold." he paused, anticipating another interruption. Asuka stayed quiet, so he went on. "The next night, the dog's master dreamed it told him to chop down the tree and make a mortar from it. When they made rice with the mortar, it turned to gold. The neighbor borrowed it, but the rice turned into rotten berries and he burned it."  
"他们刚刚就这么做了，好吗？当那只狗在他花园里挖的时候，挖到的全是骨头，所以邻居杀了那只狗，并告诉那对夫妇狗只是突然死了。他们哭了，把它埋在了发现金子的无花果树下。" 他停顿了一下，预料到会有打断。但明日香保持沉默，于是他继续说道。"第二天晚上，狗的主人梦见它告诉他砍倒那棵树，用它做一个臼。当他们用那个臼做米饭时，米饭变成了金子。邻居借了那个臼，但米饭变成了烂浆果，他把它烧了。"

Asuka soured. "Why do they keep letting him borrow stuff? Are they stupid?"  
明日香皱起了眉头。"为什么他们还让他借东西？他们是不是傻？"

"It's just a story. Anyway, the next night, the dog told his master to take the ashes and sprinkle them on the cherry trees. When he did, the trees bloomed and a Daimyo passing by gave him gifts. When the neighbor tried to do the same, the ashes blew into the Daimyo's eyes and he was thrown in prison. So when they let him out, the people wouldn't let him live in the village anymore and he couldn't find a new home."  
"这只是个故事。不过，第二天晚上，狗告诉它的主人把灰烬撒在樱桃树上。当他这么做时，树开花了，一位大名路过并给了他礼物。当邻居试图做同样的事情时，灰烬吹进了大名的眼睛，他被关进了监狱。所以当他被放出来时，人们不再让他住在村子里，他也找不到新家。"

"He deserved what he got, then," Asuka said, staring down the road. When she noticed Shinji's look, she shrugged. "He couldn't take care of himself, so he died."  
"他活该，" 明日香说，目光凝视着前方道路。注意到真嗣的眼神，她耸了耸肩。"他自己照顾不了自己，所以死了。"

"I didn't say he died."  
"我没说他死了。"

"How can you live without a house?" she snapped, handing him the remnants of her churros. "He'd freeze in the winter or get eaten by wolves."  
"没有房子你怎么活？" 她厉声说道，递给他剩下的吉事果。"他冬天会冻死，或者被狼吃掉。"

He picked at the bits left, still warm. "I guess so."  
他挑着剩下的温热碎片，"我想是的。"

"My house is going to be huge," Asuka said, arms out as she twirled. "With stone walls and iron gates. Built on a mountain like the old castles."  
"我的房子将会非常宏伟，"明日香说着，张开双臂旋转起来，"有石墙和铁门。建在山上，就像古老的城堡一样。"

Shinji leaned against the brick guarding the cemetery. "Which mountain?" he asked, watching her spin in a flurry of red and yellow.  
真嗣靠在守护墓地的砖墙上，"哪座山？"他问道，看着她在红黄交织的旋风中旋转。

"Any mountain," she said, planting her feet so she could peer straight through the clouds, hand reaching skyward. "So long as I can look down and no one can reach me."  
"任何一座山，" 她说着，稳稳地站定，透过云层直视前方，手伸向天空。"只要我能俯瞰一切，无人能触及我。"

"All by yourself?" "独自一人？"

Asuka paused, then put a glare on him, something else wavering underneath. "It won't belong to anyone but me," she said, turning and starting back the way they'd come.  
明日香顿了顿，随即向他投去一瞥，眼神中闪烁着别样的情绪。"它将只属于我一人，" 她转过身，沿着来时的路返回。

A knot released in his chest. In the back of his mind, Shinji wondered; if his shadow were cast on the wall of Asuka's castle, would she draw it and paint it there too?  
他胸中的一团纠结解开了。在心底深处，真嗣不禁思索；如果他的影子投射在明日香城堡的墙上，她是否也会在那里描绘并涂上它呢？

From Little Tibet they watched the rest of the _Karnival_ parade, waving to the stilt walkers and trying to mime the movements of the passing dancers. As the sunlight waned, so did the vibrancy of the fanfare and dresses. A shadow lurking under every jubilant face, since all knew soon the _Karnival_ would end, and they would have to go their separate ways home.  
从小西藏出发，他们观看了卡纳瓦尔狂欢节的其余部分，向踩高跷的表演者挥手，并试图模仿过往舞者的动作。随着阳光的减弱，欢庆的气氛和服饰的色彩也逐渐黯淡。每张喜悦的面孔下都潜藏着阴影，因为所有人都知道，狂欢节不久将结束，他们将不得不各自踏上归途。

### Chapter 8: Burden
Shinji had always held the suspicion, but had never known for sure. The red triangles in her hair confirmed it – Asuka was an alien. When he told her as much he was rewarded with a bruised shoulder.  
真嗣一直心存疑虑，但从未确定。她头发中的红色三角形证实了这一点——明日香是外星人。当他如此告诉她时，他得到了一个淤青的肩膀作为回报。

He chuckled, jumping back as she raised her fist again. "A cat then? No, cats are cute and cuddly..."  
他轻声笑了起来，当她再次举起拳头时，他跳开了。“那么是猫吗？不，猫是可爱又黏人的……”

"Go ahead, keep talking you little jerk," she said sweetly, while her eyes promised punishment.  
“继续说啊，你这个小混蛋，”她甜甜地说，而她的眼神预示着惩罚。

Shinji sat down on the steps leading to the back porch of the Langley house, putting up the white flag early. "Fine, what are they?"  
真嗣坐在通往兰格雷家后门廊的台阶上，早早地举起了白旗。“好吧，它们是什么？”

"A-ten clips," Asuka said with a grin, hands planted on her hips. "Haven't you ever been in an entry plug before?"  
“A-10 弹夹，”明日香带着得意的笑容说，双手叉腰。“你以前没进过插入栓吗？”

"A what?" he asked, leaning his elbows on his knees. She knew he hadn't.  
“什么？”他问，双肘撑在膝盖上。她知道他没有。

"_Entry plug_." "插入栓。"

Shinji clicked his tongue. "What the heck _is it_? And if I'm a pilot, why haven't I seen one before?"  
真嗣咂了咂嘴。“这到底是什么？既然我是驾驶员，为什么之前从没见过？”

"Probably because your robot isn't here – duh."  
“可能是因为你的机器人不在这里——废话。”

"Robot?" he asked. Shinji knew their piloting involved some sort of huge machine, but what exactly that was hadn't been clarified. He supposed a robot made sense.  
"机器人？" 他问道。真嗣知道他们的驾驶涉及某种巨大的机器，但具体是什么还没有明确说明。他想，机器人这个解释倒是说得通。

"Do you listen to anything people tell you?" she said, missing his glare as she balanced along the edge of the top step. "They're supposed to finish building mine here in Berlin."  
"你有没有听别人说话的习惯？" 她一边说，一边在最高一级的边缘保持平衡，没注意到他的瞪视。"他们应该在柏林这里完成我的建造。"

"Just yours?" "只有你的吗？"

She shrugged, wobbling. "They said yours is in Japan at Headquarters."  
她耸了耸肩，摇摇晃晃地说：“他们说你的在日本总部。”

"Headquarters for what?" he asked, willing her to fall. That might show her.  
“总部负责什么？”他问，心里暗暗希望她摔倒。那样或许能让她明白。

"NERV," she growled, plopping down next to him, "do I have to teach you everything?!"  
“NERV，”她咆哮着坐到他旁边，“难道我得教你所有东西吗？！”

_NERV_. That was a word he'd been seeing around the old Gehirn offices quite a lot recently. He was 11 now, and in the span of two years it had gone from a gated, squat complex to a huge, fortified concrete hive of activity. He wondered if it had been finished at all since his last visit.  
NERV。这是他最近在旧 Gehirn 办公室周围频繁看到的一个词。他现在 11 岁了，在过去的两年里，这里从一个有围墙的低矮建筑群变成了一个巨大的、加固的混凝土活动蜂巢。他不知道自上次访问以来，它是否真的完工了。

To Asuka, he shrugged. "Sure. You're supposed to be super smart, right?"  
对明日香，他耸了耸肩。"当然。你不是应该超级聪明吗？"

Her shoulder nudged his. "Why do you have to be so dull about everything?" she asked, face smarting as though she'd just swallowed sour raspberries.  
她的肩膀轻轻碰了碰他的。"为什么你对每件事都这么迟钝？"她问道，脸上火辣辣的，仿佛刚吞下了酸涩的覆盆子。

"All I did was ask you questions."  
"我只不过是问了你几个问题。"

Asuka bumped his shoulder again. "But you should know this stuff!"  
明日香再次撞了撞他的肩膀。"但你应该知道这些事情！"

"If I was supposed to know, someone would've told me."  
"如果我本该知道，早就有人告诉我了。"

"Typical _boy_ answer. You just don't want to admit that you're lazy and don't pay attention."  
典型的男孩回答。你只是不想承认自己懒惰且不专心。

Shinji rolled his eyes, fishing out his cell phone. She'd been like this for the past few weeks – and it was driving him up the wall. She was sort of right, he would secretly admit. Their teachers had always stressed curiosity in their students. "If there are no questions, then there are no answers." but with Asuka, one was always looked down on for asking questions instead of already having the answers. And when Asuka was in a good mood, she loved to show off by displaying how much more she knew than you.  
真嗣翻了个白眼，掏出手机。她这几周一直这样——简直让他抓狂。他私下承认，她说的有点道理。他们的老师总是强调学生要有好奇心。“如果没有问题，就没有答案。”但面对明日香，提问反而会被瞧不起，好像你应该已经知道答案似的。而当明日香心情好时，她喜欢炫耀自己比你懂得多。

Glancing up, he watched her fiddle incessantly with the A10 things in her hair. As if they might have floated away in the five seconds between her last touch.  
他抬头瞥了一眼，只见她不停地摆弄着头发上的 A10 饰品，仿佛它们会在她上次触碰后的五秒钟内飘走似的。

He hadn't seen her this excited for anything in a while. Three months ago they completed their training with Weissenburg and hadn't been back to Gehirn since. Asuka was decidedly sullen after he left, to say the least. He still remembered the vile mood she'd been in the day their drill instructor was set to leave. They were waiting out in the lobby – the one with the painting of Eden – for Misato.  
他已经很久没见过她对任何事情如此兴奋了。三个月前，他们在魏森堡完成了训练，之后就再也没回过格希恩。至少可以说，真嗣离开后，明日香明显变得郁郁寡欢。他仍然记得那天他们的训练教官即将离开时，她那糟糕透顶的情绪。他们正坐在大厅里等待美里——那个挂着伊甸园画作的大厅。

Shinji had wondered aloud where the man was. He'd been thinking of saying goodbye.  
真嗣曾大声猜测那人去了哪里。他本想道个别。

Asuka was facing away from him, chin leaning on one hand. "Who cares?" she said, folding her legs up on the chair. Shinji deflated. Though he'd never gotten the sense that the man liked him much, he couldn't deny the elation he felt whenever he was at Weissenburg's side. Whenever he did well in training and was given an approving nod. How hard he fought just for the chance to hear his praise.  
明日香背对着他，下巴靠在一只手上。“谁在乎呢？”她说着，把腿蜷缩在椅子上。真嗣感到一阵失落。尽管他从未觉得那人有多喜欢他，但他无法否认每当自己在魏森堡身边时的那种兴奋感。每当他在训练中表现出色，得到一个赞许的点头时，他为了听到那句表扬所付出的努力。

He'd never paid as much attention to his studies as he did to Weissenburg's instruction. As difficult as it was sometimes, as much as Asuka on occasion outperformed him, still he latched to the Captain's every word and every movement. He thought of one day being a man like Weissenburg. Then maybe the Order of Malta might invite him to join their ranks, so he could be a real knight instead of a pretend one.  
他对学习的关注从未像对魏森堡的教导那样投入。尽管有时这很困难，尽管有时明日香偶尔会超过他，他仍然紧紧抓住上尉的每一句话和每一个动作。他梦想有一天能成为一个像魏森堡那样的人。那样或许马耳他骑士团会邀请他加入他们的行列，让他成为一个真正的骑士，而不是一个假装的骑士。

Ambling up, Shinji muttered he was going to go look for him. Asuka didn't say anything as he left. He found Weissenburg in the locker rooms down by the training stadiums, setting his belongings in a duffel bag with steady purpose.  
信志一边嘟囔着要去找他，一边慢悠悠地走开。明日香什么也没说，看着他离开。他在训练场的更衣室里找到了魏森堡，他正有条不紊地将物品装进一个旅行袋里。

"Misato called you a wolf," Shinji said. It had been bothering him for a while now. The two had never been very friendly, not so far as he could tell, but they'd never appeared cold towards one another. Not until recently.  
“美里说你是只狼，”信志说道。这件事已经困扰他一段时间了。据他所知，两人从未特别友好，但最近之前，他们也从未显得彼此冷淡。

The man didn't seem surprised at the news. If someone had called Shinji a wolf, he'd at least wonder why.  
那男人听到消息似乎并不惊讶。如果有人称真嗣为狼，他至少会疑惑原因何在。

"I have no claws or fangs," Weissenburg said, expression stony, but the flicker of amusement in his eyes.  
“我没有爪子也没有牙齿，”魏森堡说道，表情冷硬，但眼中闪过一丝笑意。

Shinji nodded. "That's what I said. 'Well, he's still a beast' she said." Misato hadn't said it with a smile, either. She spoke to the man less than before, not even making small talk like she used to just because she hated silence. For the most part, Misato seemed to be putting an effort towards keeping Weissenburg at a distance now.  
真嗣点头道：“我就是这么说的。‘好吧，他还是个野兽’，她这么说道。”美里说这话时也没有笑意。她现在和那男人的交流比以前少得多，甚至不再像过去那样为了打破沉默而闲聊。大部分时间里，美里似乎都在努力保持与魏森堡的距离。

To Shinji, it had started once the UN lady Bolkovac left. Well, he assumed she must have left. It'd been a while since he'd even seen her. When he asked, on one seemed able to tell him where'd she gone, or why.  
对真嗣来说，一切是从联合国女士博尔科瓦茨离开时开始的。嗯，他猜她一定是离开了。他已经很久没见过她了。当他询问时，似乎没人能告诉他她去了哪里，或是为什么。

The rustle of clothing stopped, the man's hand freezing halfway to the bag. The shadow of mirth was swept away as he finished the motion and drew a small leather bound book from within. Weissenburg sat down on a nearby bench, one hand sliding over the cover and dipping into the pressed letters of the title. Shinji couldn't read it from where he was.  
衣物的窸窣声停止了，男人的手在伸向包的中途僵住。那抹戏谑的阴影随着他完成动作并从中抽出一本小巧的皮面书而消失。魏森堡坐在附近的凳子上，一只手滑过封面，探入压印的书名字母中。真嗣从他的位置无法辨认出书名。

Several times, he glanced at Shinji, uncertain. "This was my sister's favorite book as a child... I'd lost it until recently."  
他几次瞥向真嗣，显得犹豫不决。“这是我妹妹小时候最喜欢的书……直到最近我才找回来。”

"What's it about?" "这是关于什么的？"

Weissenberg grasped it firmly in both hands.  
魏森伯格用双手紧紧抓住了它。

"Once..." he finally said, struggling for words. "there was a girl who hadn't seen her mother in seven years," he went on, almost to himself. For a moment he again eyed Shinji. "Her mother dressed her in iron clothes and she was locked away in the King's castle. He told her when she wore out the clothes, she could go back to her mother. So, she rubbed herself against the walls to scrape and tear them, until finally she was free... and set out from the castle walls. Traveling through the woods to her home, she met a wolf."  
"曾经……"他终于开口，努力寻找着词汇。"有一个女孩，已经七年没见过她的母亲了，"他继续说道，几乎是在自言自语。有那么一会儿，他又看了看真嗣。"她的母亲给她穿上了铁衣，并将她锁在国王的城堡里。国王告诉她，当她磨破了这些衣服，就可以回到母亲身边。于是，她摩擦着墙壁，刮擦并撕扯它们，直到最后她自由了……离开了城堡的围墙。穿越森林回家时，她遇到了一只狼。"

"The wolf asked her whether she would take the path of pins or the path of needles to go home. The girl said the path of needles, so the wolf hurried off down the path of pins and killed her mother. When she arrived, the girl was tired from her long journey, and climbed into bed with the wolf, now disguised as her mother."  
"狼问她是否愿意选择针路还是别针路回家。女孩说选择针路，于是狼急忙沿着别针路跑去，杀死了她的母亲。当她到达时，女孩因长途跋涉而疲惫不堪，爬上了床，与伪装成她母亲的狼共眠。"

"What happened then?" Shinji asked.  
"后来发生了什么？" 真嗣问道。"

Weissenburg paused, setting the book in his bag again and zipping it closed. Shoulders slumped, hands on his thighs, Shinji could almost see the man's thoughts drifting elsewhere. "The wolf ate her."  
魏森堡停顿了一下，再次将书放入包中并拉上拉链。肩膀下垂，双手放在大腿上，真嗣几乎能看见这个男人的思绪飘向了别处。" "狼把她吃了。"

Sister Cécile had told him a story like this before, but the answer still made his skin crawl. In a way, it nearly made him angry. All of these old stories didn't make sense, and he was starting to agree with Asuka that they weren't good for anything but scaring little children.  
塞西尔姐姐以前给他讲过类似的故事，但这个答案仍然让他感到毛骨悚然。某种程度上，这几乎让他生气。所有这些古老的故事都没有意义，他开始同意明日香的观点，它们除了吓唬小孩子之外毫无用处。

He wasn't a child. 他不再是孩子了。

"If she hadn't taken off the iron clothes, then she wouldn't have been eaten." Shinji said, though by Weissenburg's cloudy gaze, an answer wasn't expected, and he tried further to piece the story together.  
“如果她没有脱下铁衣，那么她就不会被吃掉。”真嗣说道，尽管从魏森堡阴沉的目光中可以看出，并没有期待他的回答，他试图进一步拼凑这个故事。

Finally, he asked, "why did the wolf kill her?"  
最终，他问道：“为什么狼要杀她？”

Still Weissenburg wouldn't look at him. "What else would a beast do?"  
魏森堡依旧不愿看他。“野兽还能做什么呢？”

Shinji stared down between his shoes, cold trickling up his legs. He should have been able to realize that. Part of him probably did, but asked in hopes of another answer.  
真嗣盯着鞋间的地面，寒意顺着双腿蔓延而上。他本该能想到这一点的。或许他内心某处确实意识到了，但仍抱着得到另一种答案的希望发问。

"There are things I can't train you for," Weissenburg said, setting one of his large hands over the back of Shinji's neck. "Should you have to face them, you will either be a beast, or a child trapped in iron clothes."  
"有些事情我无法训练你应对，"魏森堡说，将他宽大的手掌覆在真嗣的颈后。"如果不得不面对，你将成为一头野兽，或是一个被困在铁衣中的孩子。"

Why did he have to be one or the other? What could there possibly be that Weissenburg wasn't able to train him for? Because of him, Shinji knew more about guns than most other kids his age. Had been taught how to survive in the wilderness. To focus his front sight and tune out the world around him to hit targets like a certified marksman. Knew navigation and the methods of evasion. Understood squad tactics, disarming an opponent, and all the soft parts of the body to wound and clot.  
为什么他非得是其中之一？究竟有什么是魏森堡无法训练他的？因为魏森堡，真嗣对枪械的了解超过了同龄的大多数孩子。他学会了如何在荒野中生存，如何集中前视瞄准并屏蔽周围的世界，以达到持证射手的水平。懂得导航和躲避技巧，理解小队战术、解除对手武装，以及身体所有柔软部位的创伤和止血方法。

He would never be like that girl trapped in iron and eaten by wolves.  
他永远不会像那个被困在铁衣中被狼群吞噬的女孩那样。

The warmth of a his thumb rubbing under Shinji's ear left. Weissenburg hefted his duffel bag and the heavy fall of his boots faded in favor of the rumbling air vents. That was the last time he ever saw him.  
他的拇指在真嗣耳下摩挲的温暖消失了。魏森堡提起他的旅行袋，沉重的靴子声被隆隆的通风口声所取代。那是他最后一次见到他。

The atmosphere around Gehirn had been choked after that, as if someone had sucked all the oxygen out of the building. People exchanged cursory glances, expected hellos and goodbyes, but never strayed to talk. Never let the tension in their shoulders ease.  
自那以后，GEHIRN 的氛围变得窒息，仿佛有人抽走了大楼里所有的氧气。人们交换着匆匆一瞥，期待着寒暄和告别，却从未偏离话题。从未让肩上的紧张感放松。

Something had happened, though no one would say what. For a time, he and Asuka weren't called back, and even Misato had disappeared for a while. She hadn't even told him she was leaving – or where. He'd forgiven her as soon as she'd come back a few weeks ago, though.  
发生了一些事，尽管没人愿意说是什么。有一段时间，他和明日香没有被召回，甚至连美里也消失了。她甚至没告诉他她要离开——或者去哪里。不过，几周前她一回来，他就原谅了她。

Currently, Asuka leaned into him, peering at his phone screen while he played Castle Crushers 2.  
眼下，明日香靠在他身上，一边盯着他手机屏幕，一边看他玩《城堡粉碎者 2》。

"You two ready to go, or what?" behind them a lavender haired woman was leaning on the threshold of the back door.  
“你们俩准备好了没？”在他们身后，一位紫发女子倚在后门的门槛上问道。

"Misato!" "美里！"

"Hey, kiddo," she said as he ran up to greet her, ruffling his hair.  
“嘿，小家伙，”他跑过去迎接她时，她揉乱了他的头发说道。

He glowered, trying to push her arm away – and failing. "I'm not a kid! I'm eleven."  
他皱着眉，试图推开她的手臂——却未能成功。“我不是小孩！我已经十一岁了。”

"Oh, well _excuse me_," she laughed, dragging him close as her knuckles dug into his hair.  
“哦，好吧，原谅我，”她笑着，将他拉近，手指插进他的头发。

"Stop– Misato!" he growled, desperately trying to wiggle out from under her arm. She loosened her grip, but didn't let up. "I said stop!" he yelled, finally managing to push her away.  
“住手——美里！”他咆哮着，拼命想从她的臂弯下挣脱。她松了松力道，但没有完全放开。“我说了住手！”他大喊，终于成功推开了她。

"Oh, don't be such a brat," she pouted when he glared at her. His anger did somersaults in his stomach as he realized how close they'd been. He looked away in the same second, shame creeping across his cheeks. Why'd she have to treat him like a baby all the time? He just wanted... well, he didn't know what he wanted. But the notion was something interesting – disturbing even – and all around uncomfortable.  
"哦，别这么孩子气，"她噘嘴说道，当他瞪她时。他的怒气在胃里翻腾，意识到他们曾经多么接近。他随即移开视线，羞愧爬上脸颊。为什么她总是把他当小孩子对待？他只是想要...好吧，他不知道自己想要什么。但这个念头既有趣又令人不安，总之让人很不舒服。

As Asuka walked up, he saw her eyes squinch for just a moment, then she pinched his cheek. He jerked away, retaliating with a half-hearted punch to her arm.  
当明日香走近时，他看到她的眼睛微微眯了一下，然后她捏了捏他的脸颊。他猛地躲开，回敬了一记半心半意的拳头打在她的手臂上。

"_Ow!_ That hurt!" "哎哟！好疼！"

Maybe more than half-hearted. Asuka reached for him. He grabbed her wrists and struggled to keep her at bay as she pushed against him.  
或许不仅仅是半心半意。明日香伸手去抓他。他抓住她的手腕，努力将她挡开，而她则用力推搡着他。

"Hey, _hey_–!" Misato grabbed an arm each to pull them apart. "Knock it off! Geez..." she sighed, turning to travel back through the house.  
“嘿，嘿——！”美里各抓住他们一只手臂，试图将两人分开。“别闹了！真是的……”她叹了口气，转身穿过屋子。

Shinji started to follow, only to be knocked back as Asuka moved ahead, sticking her tongue out. By the time they reached the car, she had already rushed to jump into the front passenger seat. Failing to hide a scowl – much to the redhead's satisfaction – he climbed into the back and begrudgingly buckled in.  
真嗣刚想跟上，却被明日香抢先一步，她伸出舌头做了个鬼脸。等他们到达车旁时，她已经抢先跳进了副驾驶座。他没能掩饰住自己的皱眉——这让红发女孩颇为得意——他只好不情愿地爬进后座，系上安全带。

---

They soon left the countryside behind and wound a familiar path through Berlin. Misato stopped the car several times at checkpoints manned by armed guards in tan uniforms. Soon enough, they rode up along twelve foot high concrete walls rimmed with curling spindles of barbed-wire. At the final gate, Misato had her I.D. scanned one last time before the iron blockades slipped down to let them pass.  
他们很快离开了乡村，沿着一条熟悉的路线穿过柏林。Misato 在几个由身穿卡其色制服的武装警卫把守的检查站多次停车。不久，他们沿着十二英尺高的混凝土墙行驶，墙顶环绕着卷曲的带刺铁丝网。在最后一道门前，Misato 的身份证被最后一次扫描，随后铁制路障缓缓降下，让他们通过。

The humble offices he'd come to know and mostly dislike had been transformed into a small fortress of glass facades preceded by elevated decks, reached via a long series of stairs broken up by gardened terraces.  
他曾经熟悉且大多不喜欢的简朴办公室，已被改造成一座小型玻璃幕墙堡垒，前面是高架平台，需要通过一系列被花园露台隔开的楼梯才能到达。

"Welcome to NERV-03! Quaint little place." Misato said as they rolled into a parking spot. Adults marched up and down the grand stairways, sporting suits or uniforms, a murmur of conversation and activity traveling over the courtyard.  
“欢迎来到 NERV-03！小巧玲珑的地方。”Misato 说着将车驶入一个停车位。成年人穿着西装或制服，在宏伟的楼梯上上下下，庭院中传来一阵阵交谈和活动的低语声。

"Race you to the top!" Asuka shouted, bolting up the steps. He wasn't far behind.  
“比赛看谁先到顶！”明日香喊道，猛地冲上台阶。他紧随其后，并未落后太多。

She beat him to top, only just, and turned as he staggered up the last few steps, lungs starving for oxygen. "What took you so long?" she asked, breathless.  
她险胜他到达顶端，转身看着他踉跄登上最后几级台阶，肺部急需氧气。“你怎么这么慢？”她喘着气问。

He fixed her with a glare, ignoring the jibe. "I would've... won if you hadn't... cheated."  
他瞪了她一眼，无视她的嘲讽。“如果不是你……作弊，我本可以……赢的。”

"Asuka Langley Soryu _never_ cheats... you're just mad because I'm faster than you."  
"惣流·明日香·兰格雷从不作弊...你只是因为我比你快而生气罢了。"

They walked to a gap under the tall windows stretching over the entrance, descending a ramp into the AC where lines of people waited before metal doors and watchful guards. Above the row of seven gates it read _NERV-03 Terminal 14_.  
他们走到高耸窗户下的一处缺口，沿着斜坡下到空调房，那里一排排的人在金属门和警觉的警卫前等待。在一排七个闸门上方写着 NERV-03 14 号航站楼。

"Why are there so many soldiers here?" Shinji asked.  
"为什么这里有这么多士兵？" 真嗣问道。

"NERV is a special agency under the UN," Misato answered, "so they have to make sure it's well protected. Now get your card out."  
"NERV 是联合国下属的特别机构，" 美里回答，"所以他们必须确保其安全无虞。现在把你的通行卡拿出来。"

They had to scan their cards individually, and once through, boarded an elevator. Shinji counted the levels as they ticked by.  
他们必须分别扫描各自的通行卡，通过后，便登上了一部电梯。真嗣一边看着楼层数字跳动，一边默默数着。

"Asuka's already heard it, but everything past this point is Top Secret, got it?" she said, fixing him with a long, level look.  
"明日香已经听过了，但从此往后的一切都是绝密，明白了吗？" 她说着，用一种严肃而直视的目光盯着他。

"Uh, okay?" “呃，好吧？”

The elevator dinged and they departed, reaching a door labeled: RESTRICTED AREA – Authorized Personnel Only. Misato slid her card once more before placing her palm on a grid-lined screen. A moment later it pinged in success and they descended further still into the base, guided down an icy hall with ribbed panels. Just when Shinji thought it might go on forever, a door at its end yielded to a room full of computers, tall towers with green lights flickering behind glass ports standing guard along the walls. In front of them was a table with a shimmering sky-blue surface, a hologram of – well he wasn't really sure what he was looking at. Serial numbers and other redoubts shifted around luminous models of limbs.  
电梯叮的一声到达，他们走了出来，面前是一扇标有“限制区域——仅限授权人员进入”的门。Misato 再次刷了她的卡，然后将手掌放在一个网格屏幕上。片刻后，屏幕发出成功的提示音，他们继续深入基地，沿着一条两侧有肋状面板的冰冷走廊下行。就在 Shinji 以为这条走廊永无尽头时，尽头的一扇门通向了一个满是电脑的房间，高大的塔式机器沿墙而立，玻璃端口后闪烁着绿光，宛如守卫。在他们面前是一张表面泛着天蓝色光芒的桌子，上面悬浮着一个——呃，他不太确定自己在看什么的——序列号和其他防御工事围绕着发光的肢体模型不断变换。

A few people with headsets manned some of the terminal stations, one woman sparing them a disinterested glance.  
几个戴着耳机的人在终端站工作，其中一位女士漫不经心地瞥了他们一眼。

Asuka bolted across the room towards the floor-to-ceiling windows and Shinji followed. A massive chamber at least twenty stories high was laid out before them: within which was a giant figure, though much of it was concealed by sheets of white tarp and a web-like structure of scaffolding and mezzanines that supported a series of armatures.  
明日香猛地冲向房间的落地窗，真嗣紧随其后。一个至少有二十层楼高的巨大空间展现在他们面前：其中矗立着一个巨型人形，尽管大部分被白色帆布和类似脚手架与夹层的网状结构所遮蔽，这些结构支撑着一系列的骨架。

Shinji gasped. "Wow! It's a person – a giant person!"  
真嗣倒吸一口气。“哇！这是个人——一个巨人！”

"This is Evangelion Unit-02," Misato said, leaning against the window next to him.  
“这是 EVA 二号机，”美里说着，靠在他旁边的窗户上。

"My Eva!" Asuka cheered, pressing up against the glass.  
“我的 Eva！”明日香欢呼着，紧贴着玻璃。

The door to their right slid into the wall, introducing them to a familiar German doctor. He looked a bit more weathered since they'd last seen him, harder lines under his eyes and a much paler complexion. Other people wearing white lab coats entered with him. Most didn't linger, save two. The Japanese man caught Shinji's eye right away, though he seemed more bored than anything, as if there were somewhere else he'd rather be. The second person was probably the tallest in the group, dull brown hair cut short, framing her high cheek bones and squared chin.  
右侧的门滑入墙内，一位熟悉的德国医生出现在他们面前。自上次见面以来，他显得更加沧桑，眼下的皱纹加深，肤色也苍白了许多。一群穿着白大褂的人随他进入，多数人匆匆离去，只有两人停留。那位日本男子立刻吸引了真嗣的目光，尽管他看起来颇为无聊，仿佛有其他更想去的地方。第二个人可能是这群人中最高的，深棕色的短发剪得很短，衬托出她高高的颧骨和方正的下巴。

"There you are! I've – uh," Lützow paused, a disparaging glance flickering towards his companions, "_we've_, been waiting for you."  
“你们终于来了！我——呃，”吕措停顿了一下，不悦的目光扫向他的同伴，“我们一直在等你们。”

The Japanese man's eyes fixed on Misato. "You are late."  
日本男子的目光紧盯着美里。“你迟到了。”

"I... got lost?" she ventured.  
“我……迷路了？”她试探性地回答。

"Who're you?" Asuka asked, as if in challenge.  
“你是谁？”明日香问道，语气中带着挑衅。

Lützow failed to suppress a grimace as he combed a hand through his graying hair. "Ah, yes, introductions I suppose. Asuka, Shinji: this is the new Assistant Director from Fourth Branch's Technological Division. She was just transferred over..."  
律佐未能掩饰住脸上的苦笑，一边用手梳理着灰白的头发，一边说道：“啊，是的，我想应该先介绍一下。明日香，真嗣：这位是来自第四支部技术部门的新任副导演。她刚刚调过来……”

"Alyona Moskva," she said, brown-green eyes almost curious.  
“阿莉奥娜·莫斯科娃，”她开口道，棕绿色的眼睛带着几分好奇。

"And this–" “而这位——”

"Inazuma Fuse," he said, drawing a scowl from Lützow. "Head of Research, Headquarters Division."  
"稻妻融合," 他说道，引来了吕佐夫的皱眉。"总部研究部门负责人。"

Lützow grunted. "Right, well, might as well show you around before we get started." he led them through the left side of the control room, down a curving path that brought them into the bright, sterile light of Unit-02's housing. They were on the highest gantry, able to overlook the entire facility and its bustling crews.  
吕佐夫哼了一声。"好吧，在我们开始之前，不妨先带你四处看看。" 他带领他们穿过控制室的左侧，沿着一条弯曲的路径，来到了二号机库明亮、无菌的灯光下。他们站在最高的平台上，能够俯瞰整个设施及其忙碌的工作人员。

"This is what we're piloting?" Shinji asked, practically hanging over the railing.  
"这就是我们要驾驶的吗？" 真嗣问道，几乎整个人都趴在了栏杆上。

Asuka shot him a glare. "No one but me gets to pilot this one."  
明日香瞪了他一眼。“除了我，没人能驾驶这个。”

"That's right," Lützow said with a tight smirk, "but you are correct, Shinji. We've spent a very long time preparing the Evangelions."  
“没错，”吕措带着一丝僵硬的微笑说，“但你是对的，真嗣。我们已经为这些福音战士准备了很长时间。”

"You've only built this one," Inazuma said. "_After_ Tokyo developed the prototypes."  
“你们只造了这一个，”稻妻说。“在东京开发了原型机之后。”

"I was referring to NERV's collective efforts. Unless Tokyo is going to claim they've done this all by themselves?"  
"我指的是 NERV 全体的努力。难道东京要宣称这一切都是他们独自完成的吗？"

Inazuma's eyes squinched, and he looked to have more to say, but held his tongue. After a brief glaring match, both decided to stand down, all while Moskva sported a growing grimace.  
Inazuma 的眼睛眯了起来，显然还有话要说，但还是忍住了。经过短暂的瞪眼较量后，双方都决定退让，而 Moskva 则露出了越来越难看的表情。

Shinji was practically boiling over with questions, but settled on the most obvious. "How does it work?"  
真嗣满腹疑问，几乎要爆发出来，但还是选择了最显而易见的问题。“它是如何运作的？”

"That's a rather broad question," Moskva said, only a bit of a Russian accent creeping through her German. "Do you mean to ask how you control it?"  
"那是个相当宽泛的问题，" 莫斯科说，只有一点点俄罗斯口音从她的德语中渗透出来。"你是想问如何控制它吗？"

He nodded. 他点点头。

"To put it simply, the answer is through electrochemical communication."  
"简单来说，答案是通过电化学通信。"

At Shinji's befuddled look, Lützow poked his head. "With your thoughts."  
看到真嗣困惑的表情，吕措探过头来。"用你的思维。"

"Oh," his brow furrowed, "why's it have to be so big?"  
"哦，" 他的眉头紧皱，"为什么它得这么大？"

"Who cares!?" Asuka barked, excited more than anything else. She grabbed his arm, tugging him down the gantry to show him its head. She pointed to all the different parts, listing off in rapid fire where the entry plug was supposed to go and where all the different weapons were going to be. But the only part they could really see was the chest, shining segmented steel plates coming together at a downward point.  
"谁在乎！？" 明日香激动地喊道，她抓住他的手臂，拉着他沿着通道去展示它的头部。她指着各个部件，快速地告诉他驾驶舱应该放在哪里，以及所有武器将安装在哪里。但他们能真正看到的只有胸部，闪亮的分段钢板在下端汇聚。

"So, it's silver?" "所以，它是银色的？"

"No, that's just the base metal. They haven't painted it yet." her eyes widened and she let out a small gasp. "Misato! Tell them to paint it red!"  
“不，那只是底材，他们还没上漆呢。”她的眼睛睁大了，发出一声小小的惊呼。“美里！告诉他们把它涂成红色！”

The woman chuckled. "I'll see what we can do, Asuka."  
女人轻声笑了。“我会看看能做些什么，明日香。”

She smiled and looked back down at Unit-02, going on about her Eva and how it was going to be the best – _way_ better than the two in Japan. He wouldn't know. Her expression was the brightest he'd ever seen it. That was good. He didn't like to see her as quiet and mopey as she had been the past few months. She was a lot less grumpy now too.  
她微笑着，再次低头看向二号机，继续谈论她的 EVA，说它将会是最好的——比日本的那两台好得多。他不知道这些。她的表情是他见过的最明亮的。这很好。他不喜欢看到她像过去几个月那样安静和闷闷不乐。现在她也少了很多暴躁。

"Why are you looking at me like that?"  
"你为什么那样看着我？"

He blinked, a smile he didn't realize he was wearing dropping from his face. He leaned forward against the railing, pretending to have found something of immense interest down below. "Like what? I wasn't doing anything."  
他眨了眨眼，脸上未曾察觉的微笑消失了。他向前靠在栏杆上，假装发现了下面某个极其有趣的东西。"像什么？我什么也没做。"

"You _were_ – weirdo!" she said, poking his chest.  
"你刚才——怪人！" 她戳了戳他的胸口。"

"I wasn't!" “我没有！”

Lützow stuffed a hand in his lab-coat pocket, the other snapping in quick succession as he about faced. "Come along – we still have a lot to do tonight," he said, and Asuka ribbed Shinji the whole way, grin only widening when he complained she was too close and that he didn't want to talk to her. Only 'cause she knew he didn't mean it.  
律子奥将一只手塞进实验服口袋，另一只手迅速连续地拍打着，转身说道：“快点跟上——今晚我们还有很多事要做。”他说道，而明日香一路上都在逗弄真嗣，每当他抱怨她靠得太近，不想和她说话时，她的笑容就愈发灿烂。只是因为她知道他并非真心。

The locker room was frigid, chilling his bones and turning the quick change of attire into a race to escape the cold. A race he was losing. It had taken him almost fifteen minutes to get the stupid suit on. There was a thin black mesh on the inside, but it didn't make it any easier to fit into the thing. Misato said if he didn't have it on tight around his arms and legs it wouldn't seal properly. He adjusted the chest piece a few more times, hoping he was doing it right and far too embarrassed to go ask his caretaker for help. Clamping the neck-piece together like he'd been shown, Shinji clicked the device at his wrist and jumped when the suit snap-hissed to his body.  
更衣室冷得刺骨，寒意透骨，换衣服变成了一场逃离寒冷的竞赛。而他正在输掉这场比赛。他花了将近十五分钟才把那件愚蠢的紧身衣穿上。里面有一层薄薄的黑色网眼，但这并没有让穿起来变得更容易。美里说，如果他的手臂和腿没有紧紧地裹在衣服里，它就无法正确密封。他调整了几次胸甲，希望自己做得对，又太害羞不敢去问他的看护人求助。按照指示将颈甲扣好，真嗣按下手腕上的装置，当紧身衣咔嚓一声贴合到他身上时，他吓了一跳。

He checked himself, making sure everything was where it should be. The suit itself was mostly white, with a few red markings here and there, the black mesh revealing itself between a few of the angled plates over his stomach. _Kind of like the Eva_, he thought. Though the armor, if he could really call it that, was just a hard kind of plastic. Or so he guessed. It was bulky around his shoulders and chest, but not top heavy.  
他检查了一下自己，确保一切都井然有序。这套装束以白色为主，间或点缀着几处红色标记，黑色网格在覆盖腹部的几块斜板间若隐若现。有点像 EVA，他想。尽管这盔甲，如果真能这么称呼的话，只是一种硬塑料。或者他是这么猜测的。它在他肩部和胸部显得臃肿，但并不头重脚轻。

The suit creaked as he walked towards what Misato called the Testing Chambers. A shiver scuttled down his spine and he stopped in his tracks.  
当他走向美里所说的测试室时，这套装束随着他的步伐发出吱吱声。一阵寒意沿着他的脊椎窜下，他停下了脚步。

A pool of translucent red liquid stretched out before him. Wires and tubes spilled from the low ceiling, connecting into ports at the neck of a figure with a head either made of metal or held in some kind of thick mask. His gut sank as he took in the depth of the tanks, the thing inside little more than a torso with two arms that cut off at the wrists. There was a cavity in its sternum, occupied by something that looked mechanical, at least from where he was. There were two other pools within the corridor, marked off with black and yellow strips of caution paint.  
一滩半透明的红色液体在他面前延伸开来。从低矮的天花板上垂下的电线和管子，连接到颈部的一个端口，那里的头部要么是金属制成，要么被某种厚重的面具所固定。当他看到水槽的深度，里面的东西不过是一个截去手腕的双臂的躯干时，他的胃沉了下去。它的胸骨处有一个空腔，里面装着某种机械装置，至少从他所在的位置看是这样。走廊里还有另外两个水池，用黑黄相间的警示带标记着。

A finger jabbing him in the side made Shinji jump, though he stifled a yelp.  
一根手指戳在他侧腰上，让真嗣吓了一跳，尽管他强忍住了惊叫。

"Ooh, Shinji, when did you get so muscly?" Misato cooed, giving his bicep a squeeze. He yanked his arm away and she giggled.  
“哦，真嗣，你什么时候变得这么肌肉发达了？”美里娇声说道，捏了捏他的二头肌。他猛地抽回手臂，她咯咯笑了起来。

"Stop teasing me," he grumbled, taking a step back – from both Misato and the red pool. "What is that?"  
“别逗我了，”他咕哝着，后退了一步——既远离美里，也远离那滩红水。“那是什么？”

She shrugged. "Just a dummy. It's supposed to simulate the piloting process. Or so I'm told."  
她耸了耸肩。“只是个假人。据说是用来模拟驾驶过程的。至少我是这么被告知的。”

Asuka came in from the opposite end of the Testing Chambers in a suit not unlike his. Most of it was similarly a plain white, the torso sporting red colorations. It was shaped differently, yet had the same large print 'TEST' just where the collar bones met. She moved easily in it. Not in the awkward, stiff way Shinji did.  
明日香从测试室的另一端走了进来，穿着一套与他相似的装束。大部分都是纯白色，躯干部分带有红色装饰。虽然形状不同，但在锁骨相接处同样印有醒目的“测试”字样。她穿着这套衣服行动自如，丝毫没有像真嗣那样笨拙僵硬。

"I hate this suit," she sighed, nose twitching as her eyes fixed to the top of his head. She reached up and adjusted his headset.  
“我讨厌这身衣服，”她叹了口气，鼻子微微抽动，目光锁定在他的头顶。她伸手调整了他的耳机。

"Why are we wearing these?" he asked as she positioned it to her liking.  
“我们为什么要穿这些？”他问道，而她正将它调整到自己喜欢的位置。

Before Asuka could answer, Lützow came stumbling over a wire from across the pool. "We're going to start testing your ability to synchronize with the Evangelion," he said, fiddling with an open panel.  
在明日香回答之前，吕措号踉跄地从泳池对面被一根电线绊倒。“我们要开始测试你与福音战士的同步能力了，”他说着，摆弄着一个打开的面板。

"Synchronize?" “同步？”

"Mhm. It is what will allow you to issue mental commands to the Eva, controlling it as if it were your own body."  
"嗯，这就是让你能够向 Eva 发出精神指令，控制它如同控制自己的身体一样的东西。"

Shinji followed Lützow up a set of grated stairs alongside the suspended head, the walkway curving in an arc around the back. A long, white cylinder was waiting there, sitting upon a ringed platform, the base of it touching the water where it would meet the mutilated body's spine. Along its length were the words – EVA-01 PROTOTYPE. Underneath that, in much smaller print, was a serial number and the date: _05-07-2004_ /_Obsolete_/ stamped in red paint.  
真嗣跟着吕措号沿着一排格栅楼梯向上，旁边是悬浮的头颅，走道呈弧形绕到后方。那里有一个长长的白色圆柱体，坐落在环形平台上，其底部触及水面，将与残破躯体的脊椎相接。沿着它的长度刻着一行字——EVA-01 原型机。在其下方，用更小的字体印着序列号和日期：2004 年 5 月 7 日/已淘汰/，用红色油漆印着。

"This is the technology that will allow you to link with the Evangelion," Lützow said, patting the white tube affectionately. "You'll be situated in the command suite here and submerged in LCL."  
"这项技术将使你能够与福音战士连接，""吕措说，亲切地拍了拍白色圆柱体。""你将位于这里的指挥舱内，并被 LCL 液淹没。""

Moskva stepped up next to Misato. "It's going to feel like you're drowning when the LCL fills your lungs. But once that happens, your blood will be oxygenated directly."  
莫斯科走到美里身边。“当 LCL 充满你的肺部时，你会感觉像是要溺水。但一旦发生，你的血液将直接被氧气化。”

"So I'll still be able to breathe?"  
“所以我还能呼吸吗？”

"Essentially." “基本上是的。”

Asuka pushed her nose up with a thumb. "You have to suck it in through your nose. It hurts more, but you choke less."  
明日香用拇指顶了顶鼻尖。“你得通过鼻子吸入。虽然更疼，但呛得少。”

That managed a half-smirk. "What is it for?"  
这话让他勉强扯出一个半笑不笑的表情。“这是干什么用的？”

"The LCL acts like a communication link. The A-tens," Lützow tapped Shinji's headset, "bounce your thoughts through the LCL, which channels them as commands to the Eva's brain. Much easier than trying to create an uplink by jamming a neural interface into your skull, eh?"  
“LCL 液充当通信链接。A-10 头盔，”吕措敲了敲真嗣的头戴式耳机，“通过 LCL 液传递你的思维，将其转化为 EVA 的指令。总比硬往你脑袋里塞神经接口建立连接要容易得多，对吧？”

Shinji didn't think that was as funny as Lützow did. He looked to the head facing down in the liquid. "It has a brain?"  
真嗣并不觉得这有吕措那么好笑。他看向浸泡在液体中的头部。“它有大脑吗？”

"Purely cybernetic..." Moskva said, "it can't actually think for itself."  
“纯粹的电子机械……”莫斯科说道，“它无法真正自主思考。”

Shinji supposed that was why they needed a pilot.  
真嗣猜想这就是为什么它们需要一个驾驶员。

"It is there to decipher the neural input from the pilot," Inazuma said, as if put upon. "This communication between pilot and machine happens all the quicker the higher your synchronization rates with it are."  
"这是用来解读驾驶员神经输入的，"伊纳兹马说，仿佛被逼无奈。"驾驶员与机器之间的这种交流，同步率越高，速度就越快。"

Shinji nodded, and they took the time to explain a few features of the entry plug – primarily where the emergency exit hatch was and the manual release. Lützow then took Asuka to an adjacent chamber, while Inazuma left for the control room and Moskva coached him on the command suite. She said for now he didn't have to do much more than sit there. So he settled himself inside, finding the oversized chair surprisingly comfortable. It actually reminded him a bit of an airplane cockpit, and was kind of awesome. Then the hatch sealed and he immediately wanted out.  
真嗣点点头，他们花时间解释了插入栓的一些功能——主要是紧急出口舱门和手动释放装置的位置。吕措号随后带明日香去了相邻的舱室，而伊纳兹马则前往控制室，莫斯科号指导他操作指挥系统。她说目前他只需坐在那里，不需要做太多事情。于是他坐进那把超大的椅子，意外地发现相当舒适。这让他想起了飞机驾驶舱，感觉挺酷的。随后舱门关闭，他立刻就想出去。

But he couldn't quit now. Not with Asuka and Misato and everyone else watching. The former would never let him live it down. He swallowed down his trepidation. A few lights at the rear of the plug snapped on and he felt it spin, waiting long minutes in the semi-darkness.  
但他现在不能退出。不是在明日香、美里和其他所有人都在看着的情况下。前者绝不会让他轻易过关。他咽下心中的不安。插入栓后部的几盏灯亮起，他感到它在旋转，在半黑暗中等待了漫长的几分钟。

A radio-link buzzed to life. "Begin LCL injection," Lützow said.  
无线电连接发出嗡鸣声。“开始注入 LCL。”吕措说道。

"Roger, flooding entry plug."  
“收到，正在充满插入栓。”

A thick, soupy orange substance slowly spilled in from the bottom of the plug, rising steadily. It was cold as it started to swallow his legs, until the suit regulated the temperature. He braced himself as it reached his neck, swallowing in as it reached over his head. He gagged, a headache pulsing to life in his sinuses. He _did_ feel like he was drowning – all at once he couldn't breathe and liquid was spilling down his throat. Bile tickled his trachea, but he held it down despite his panic. At last the LCL pooled into his lungs and he could breathe again – yet he couldn't. He had the air but didn't need to... well, to breathe for it.  
一种浓稠的橙色物质从插入栓底部缓缓流入，逐渐上升。当它开始吞噬他的双腿时，感觉冰冷，直到战斗服调节了温度。他紧绷着身体，当液体升至他的颈部，覆盖过头顶时，他感到一阵恶心，头痛在鼻窦中跳动。他确实感觉自己像是在溺水——突然间无法呼吸，液体涌入喉咙。胃酸刺激着他的气管，尽管恐慌，他还是强忍着。终于，LCL 充满了他的肺部，他又能呼吸了——然而却无法真正呼吸。他有空气，但并不需要...好吧，不需要通过呼吸来获取它。

White and black splotches burst over his vision at the sensation. Shinji gripped the control sticks tighter.  
白色和黑色的斑点在他的视线中爆发，伴随着这种感觉。真嗣更紧地握住了操纵杆。

"Beginning primary contact."  
"开始初步接触。"

"Inserting synapses, connecting junctions."  
"插入突触，连接节点。"

"Transmitting pulse." "脉冲传输中。"

Status lights winked to life on his plugsuit, and he could feel tiny conductors vibrating between the mesh and plating.  
状态指示灯在他紧身衣上闪烁着亮起，他能感觉到微小的导体在网格和装甲板之间振动。

"Begin secondary contact."  
"开始二次接触。"

"Roger, connecting interface."  
"罗杰，连接接口。"

"Connecting A-ten nerve-links."  
"正在连接 A-十神经链接。"

Shinji flinched as thin, invisible strands of wire cut and dipped into his brain, weaving through tissue and spiraling out into the LCL. Parts of him were everywhere. His thoughts felt loose, drifting out into nothing, like his dreams with the dark ocean. The wires took the drifting bits and sewed them back in place, bit by bit.  
真嗣感到一阵刺痛，细如发丝、肉眼难见的电线切开他的大脑，穿梭于组织之间，螺旋状延伸至 LCL 中。他的部分意识散布各处。思绪变得松散，飘向虚无，如同他在黑暗海洋中的梦境。电线捕捉到这些飘散的碎片，一点一点地将它们重新缝合。

"All circuits are operational. A-ten connection is nominal."  
"所有电路运行正常。A-十号连接状态良好。"

"LCL charge is normal." "LCL 充填正常。"

As they spoke a wash of colors and spectrums flared within the plug, pulsing over his head before coalescing into a view of the Testing Chamber. The LCL elicited a snap-hiss as the orange hue was whisked away to become clear.  
在他们交谈之际，插头内爆发出一片色彩与光谱的浪潮，在他头顶脉动，随后汇聚成测试室的景象。LCL 引发了一声清脆的嘶响，橙色迅速消散，变得清澈。

"Borderline clear, checking harmonic values."  
"边界清晰，正在检查谐波值。"

"Base proto-synchronization rate calculated."  
"基础原型同步率已计算。"

He felt fuzzy. Every sliver of skin was numb – and he blinked, trying to clear his eyes. He went from having a headache to something like a sledge hammer shattering his skull open. He was told he would get used to it.  
他感到模糊不清。每一寸肌肤都麻木了——他眨了眨眼，试图让视线清晰。从头痛到仿佛被大锤砸开头骨的感觉，他被告知会逐渐适应。

Asuka's face sprang up beside him and he hollered. Then, curious, waved his hand through the holographic panel. Asuka laughed on the other side.  
明日香的脸突然出现在他旁边，他大叫一声。然后，出于好奇，他挥手穿过全息面板。明日香在另一边笑了起来。

"Hey, how'd you do that?" he asked, glancing from her to the controls and trying to remember everything Moskva had told him. Was that button there for manual LCL drain? Those switches there maybe? Or was that just part of the mock-up combat suite?  
“嘿，你是怎么做到的？”他问道，目光从她转向控制台，试图回忆莫斯科告诉他的所有信息。那个按钮是手动 LCL 排空吗？那些开关呢？还是那只是模拟战斗套件的一部分？

"You don't have to open another window, dummy. I'm broadcasting to your plug!"  
“你不需要再开一个窗口，傻瓜。我在向你的插入栓广播！”

"Children," Lützow sighed, "please do not be disruptive, these tests require as little outside interference and stimuli as possible."  
“孩子们，”吕措叹了口气，“请不要捣乱，这些测试需要尽可能少的干扰和刺激。”

Shinji didn't really hear him as Asuka started making faces, and he was half smiling, batting his hand at the screen and trying to figure out how to make it go away. Then he remembered what Inazuma said. "Wait, let me try."  
真嗣并没有真正听到他的话，因为明日香开始做鬼脸，他一边微笑一边用手拍打屏幕，试图弄清楚如何让它消失。然后他想起了稻妻说的话。“等等，让我试试。”

Voices from the control center made resigned comments as Shinji took hold of the controls and closed his eyes, trying to think. Except he wasn't really sure what he was supposed to be thinking, and just imagined his face popping up in Asuka's plug.  
控制中心传来的声音带着无奈的评论，真嗣握住控制器并闭上眼睛，试图思考。只是他不太确定自己应该思考什么，只是想象着自己的脸出现在明日香的插入栓里。

Error notifications cropped up and the pressure on Shinji's brain increased tenfold. He grabbed his head, fighting a frown. Asuka leaned closer to the window, as if that would allow her to peer further into his plug, half-concerned and half-annoyed. "It's not a thought-impulse, idiot. The controls are–"  
错误提示接连出现，Shinji 的脑压陡增十倍。他双手抱头，强忍着不皱眉。Asuka 更靠近窗户，仿佛这样能让她更深入地窥视他的驾驶舱，一半关切一半恼火。“这不是思维冲动，笨蛋。控制器是——”

"_Please_ disconnect her uplink."  
“请断开她的连接。”

Her window was whisked away, and for a moment he swore he could hear the echo of a frustrated howl from the comm line in the control center.  
她的窗户被迅速移走，有那么一瞬，他发誓能听到控制中心通讯线路中传来一声沮丧的咆哮回响。

---

After the initial shock wore off, sitting in the entry plug was actually very boring. He could imagine it was different operating with the real thing, but for the next hour all he did was sit there while the controllers occasionally muttered operational markers over the radio.  
最初的震惊过去后，坐在插入栓里其实非常无聊。他可以想象实际操作时会有所不同，但接下来的一个小时里，他只是坐在那里，偶尔听到控制人员通过无线电低声念出操作标记。

At last they told him he was done and drained the plug before sliding the hatch open. He hung over the side for a few minutes, hocking up the LCL that clung stubbornly to his throat. Thankfully, Misato soon arrived with a towel.  
终于，他们告诉他可以结束了，并在打开舱门之前排空了插入栓。他靠在边上几分钟，费力地吐出黏在喉咙里的 LCL。幸运的是，美里很快带着毛巾赶来了。

They had him standing over a grated area, still dripping a bit with the orange stuff that filled his nostrils with the scent of copper. He'd been given another towel to dry his head with, but didn't want to change and shower just yet. He was, from a non-invasive distance, watching over the shoulder of a technician as readings and gauges for Asuka's plug fluctuated.  
他们让他站在一个格栅区域，身上还滴着那种橙色的液体，铜的味道充斥着他的鼻腔。他拿到了另一条毛巾擦干头发，但还不想换衣服或洗澡。他站在一个不干扰的距离，透过技术人员的肩膀观察着明日香插入栓的读数和仪表波动。

"Why has the Research Division waited so long to start testing him?" he heard Misato ask in a hushed tone. He pretended to be absorbed in the computer screen. "And why here? Shouldn't they have taken him to HQ by now?"  
“为什么研究部门这么晚才开始测试他？”他听到美里低声问道。他假装全神贯注于电脑屏幕。“而且为什么在这里？他们现在不应该把他带到总部去吗？”

"Direct– I mean, Commander Ikari's orders," Lützow answered. "We have the core unit – and the original plug they used for the contact experiment will suffice for testing until the streamline models are ready. As to why, I couldn't be certain. It seems the Commander wanted to be sure he could even synchronize before transferring him."  
“直接——我是说，碇司令的命令，”律子回答。“我们有核心单元——以及他们用于接触实验的原装插入栓，在流线型模型准备好之前，这足以进行测试。至于为什么，我不太确定。似乎司令想在转移他之前确保他能同步。”

Commander? His father? That must mean he was in charge of the Headquarters Asuka was talking about.  
司令？他的父亲？那一定意味着他是阿斯纳提到的总部的负责人。

"Wasn't that why he was picked? Didn't the Marduk Institute identify him?"  
"难道这不是他被选中的原因吗？玛杜克研究所不是已经确认了他吗？"

Shinji caught Lützow's shrug, a pause between them as he looked to a readout across the room. "Everyone on their list is a candidate, but that doesn't mean they are all able to take the mental strain."  
真嗣捕捉到了吕措的耸肩动作，两人之间出现了一丝停顿，他望向房间另一头的读数。“他们名单上的每个人都是候选人，但这并不意味着他们都能承受精神压力。”

Though he couldn't see her, Shinji imagined Misato must've made a puzzled look.  
尽管看不见她，真嗣想象着美里一定露出了困惑的表情。

Inazuma spoke softly. "Some are more suited to piloting that others."  
Inazuma 轻声说道。“有些人比其他人更适合驾驶。”

"It just seems odd they wouldn't want to start syncing him with Unit-one as soon as possible," she said.  
“他们似乎不想尽快让他与初号机同步，这有点奇怪，”她说。

Shinji spun around. "Misato, when will my Eva be done?"  
真嗣转过身来。“美里，我的 Eva 什么时候能准备好？”

She jumped and her eyes widened a little. If they were just testing him because his Eva wasn't ready, the sooner it was finished, the sooner his father would call him home. For the first time in a while he thought of that stupid letter he'd tore up. He didn't have long left.  
她跳了起来，眼睛微微睁大。如果他们只是因为他那未准备好的 Eva 而测试他，那么 Eva 越早完成，他父亲就越早会叫他回家。他已经有段时间没想起那封被他撕掉的愚蠢信件了。他剩下的时间不多了。

"Um, I'm not sure, kiddo. I think they're nearly done with final assembly. Testing trials are supposed to start early twenty-fourteen."  
“呃，我不太确定，孩子。我想他们快完成最终组装了。测试试验应该会在二零一四年初开始。”

Moskva made a wry face. "I should hope so, we need the data from Unit-one if we're going to have the production model ready on schedule. First and Second Branch are antsy enough as it is."  
莫斯科苦笑了一下。“我当然希望如此，我们需要一号机的数据，才能按时准备好量产型。第一和第二分部已经够焦躁的了。”

Lützow waved his hand. "They won't even have the muscular layers fully formed for another year at least – they can make adjustments. The U.S. is probably just upset they won't have a functioning Evangelion before everyone else."  
吕措挥了挥手。“他们至少还要一年才能完全形成肌肉层——还可以调整。美国大概只是因为自己不能比别人先造出能用的福音战士而感到沮丧。”

Inazuma nodded. "We could have had them done much sooner, if China had signed off in two-thousand six. They're only now jumping on the band wagon because they see it can be done."  
稻妻点头道：“如果中国在 2006 年就批准了，我们本可以更快完成的。他们现在才加入是因为看到这事儿能成。”

"After losing the entirety of their coastal provinces, feeding and housing a few million refugees _did_ seem a more pressing issue than some theoretical war machine," Moskva said.  
“在失去了整个沿海省份后，养活和安置数百万难民确实比某些理论上的战争机器更为紧迫。”莫斯科说道。

"They knew what the stakes were," Lützow spat. "The Protectorate was just upset over all of the sanctions put on them in the Valentines Treaty. I only hope their bitterness hasn't set us back."  
“他们知道赌注是什么，”吕措啐了一口，“不过是保护国对《情人节条约》中施加的制裁感到不满罢了。我只希望他们的怨气没有让我们倒退。”

At that, Inazuma's eyes settled directly on Shinji's, and he felt invisible hands clamping around his spine. "So do we all."  
听到这话，稻妻的目光直接落在了真嗣身上，他感觉仿佛有无形的手紧紧抓住了他的脊梁。“我们都是这么希望的。”

Tests at NERV took up their days just as the training with Weissenburg had. Even here, Asuka was adored by the mostly German staff, treating her as they might their own daughter. That usually left him with Moskva, Inazuma and Misato. The first peered past everyone, as if waiting for a future that couldn't arrive fast enough, and the second was much like Teacher – distant and flat – though sharpened with a bitter condescension.  
在 NERV 的测试占据了他们的日子，就像与魏森堡的训练一样。即便在这里，明日香也深受大多数德国员工的喜爱，他们待她如同自己的女儿。这通常让他与莫斯科、稻妻和美里为伴。前者总是透过众人凝视，仿佛在等待一个无法快速到来的未来，而后者则与老师颇为相似——疏离而平淡——尽管带着一种苦涩的傲慢。

Really, it didn't feel any different from school, even if there were plenty of people from other countries there. Moskva explained that NERV was a global organization, but there were very few on the research team who weren't German.  
真的，感觉和学校没什么两样，尽管那里有许多来自其他国家的人。莫斯科解释说，NERV 是一个全球性组织，但研究团队中几乎没有非德国人。

Moskva was always very serious, to the point where he was frightened of making _any_ kind of mistake during his tests. After each one, she would bring him into the control room so he could read the synchronization charts, filled out with data collected from the plug. He didn't really understand it and Moskva never explained. Though he deciphered it enough to find his sync ratio aligned within the tabs labeled 'nerve connectors'.  
莫斯科总是非常严肃，以至于他在测试中害怕犯任何错误。每次测试后，她都会带他进入控制室，让他阅读同步图表，这些图表填满了从插入栓收集的数据。他其实不太懂，莫斯科也从未解释过。尽管他勉强能解读出自己的同步率与标签为“神经连接器”的栏目相符。

When he asked Asuka about it, her answer made his jaw drop. "36%?" he asked.  
当他向明日香询问时，她的回答让他目瞪口呆。“36%？”他问道。

She shrugged. "Yeah, what's yours?"  
她耸了耸肩。“是啊，你的呢？”

_13.1%_

"I– I dunno." “我——我不知道。”

From then on, he tried to make the percentage go up for his tests. He didn't actually know what he was supposed to do to make that happen, but it crawled its way higher and higher, little by little, and each time Moskva would take him to the in-house food court and buy him whatever he wanted. She never smiled and they never talked. All the same, he never stopped trying to get that number higher.  
从那时起，他努力提高考试的分数。他并不清楚具体该怎么做才能实现这一点，但分数一点点地攀升，越来越高，每次莫斯科都会带他去内部的餐饮区，买他想要的任何东西。她从不微笑，他们也从不交谈。即便如此，他从未停止过努力提高那个数字。

---

It was morning. Shinji was preparing for yet another school day, clad in the usual uniform for his grade level: dark blue khakis and jacket. He left his white undershirt untucked for the time being. Asuka would fuss over it later and he couldn't be bothered. It was just too early.  
清晨时分，真嗣正为又一个上学日做准备，身着符合他年级的校服：深蓝色长裤和夹克。他暂时将白色内衣下摆散开，懒得理会。明日香稍后会为此唠叨，但他现在实在没心情应付，毕竟时间还早。

As he stepped across the Langley's back porch, he thought, with some amusement, back to her birthday the year before last when she'd turned 10.  
当他跨过兰格利家的后门廊时，不禁带着几分趣味回想起前年她的十岁生日。

_A wretched cough tore its way out of Asuka's throat, the kind you could imagine ripping someone's lungs to shreds. Her body convulsed as it triggered a bout of hacking. She fell back into her pillows, exhausted, sporting a puffy red nose and pale cheeks.  
一阵剧烈的咳嗽从明日香喉咙中撕扯而出，那种仿佛能将人肺撕成碎片的咳嗽。她的身体随之剧烈颤抖，引发了一阵猛烈的干咳。她疲惫地倒回枕头中，鼻子红肿，面颊苍白。_

_"Asuka?" he asked from the doorway to her room. Her head rolled towards him, bed sheets shifting.  
"明日香？" 他从她房间的门口问道。她的头转向他，床单随之移动。_

_"Hey, Shinji," she rasped, barely above a whisper, a small cough shaking her chest. Mrs Langley touched a hand to his back, urging him forward. He'd spied Herr Langley down in the kitchen, garbed in an olive green uniform with golden pins and buttons, a dozen colored ribbons adorning his chest. The man had spared him a glance and a small smile as he passed.  
"嘿，真嗣，" 她嘶哑地说，声音几乎细不可闻，一阵轻微的咳嗽震动她的胸膛。兰格利夫人轻触他的背，催促他向前。他在厨房里瞥见了兰格利先生，身着橄榄绿制服，金色别针和纽扣闪闪发光，胸前挂着一打彩色缎带。那人经过时，给了他一个眼神和一丝微笑。_

_Shinji sat in the empty chair at Asuka's bedside, taking in her heavy eyelids and wondering what could make her so sick. She'd been absent from school yesterday, sending him frowny faces over text. Mrs Langley said it was strep throat, but for all he knew it could be some deadly foreign disease.  
真嗣坐在明日香床边的空椅子上，注视着她沉重的眼皮，想知道是什么让她病得这么重。她昨天没去学校，通过短信给他发了一些皱眉的表情。兰格利夫人说是链球菌性喉炎，但对他来说，这可能是某种致命的外国疾病。_

_Asuka pulled the covers up over her nose, so all he could see were her eyes. "Don't look at me. I'm gross." her muffled voice said.  
明日香把被子拉到鼻子上，他只能看到她的眼睛。“别看我，我很难看。”她闷闷的声音说道。_

_He chuckled. It was supposed to be her birthday today. So long as he'd known her, she'd never celebrated them in any spectacular fashion. Her parents always made an attempt, but she always found a way to throw it back in their faces, so they'd stopped trying. Birthday parties were for little kids, or so she said. His own birthdays weren't much of an event either. They came and went like any other day.  
他轻声笑了。今天本该是她的生日。自从认识她以来，她从未以任何特别的方式庆祝过。她的父母总是试图做些什么，但她总能找到方法回敬他们，所以他们放弃了尝试。生日派对是给小孩子准备的，她是这么说的。他自己的生日也没什么特别的。它们和其他日子一样来去匆匆。_

_For her birthday this year, he'd bought her more charcoal sticks and a new hair brush. Misato hadn't been around to give him another loan for jewelry.  
今年为了她的生日，他给她买了更多的炭笔和一把新梳子。美里没有再借给他钱买珠宝。_

_"Are you gonna' be okay?" he asked as she finished yet another coughing fit.  
“你还好吗？”他问，看着她又一次咳嗽发作结束。_

_"'Course I am, dummy," she croaked, coughing once more.  
“当然没事，傻瓜，”她嘶哑地说，又咳了一声。_

_He tried and failed to stifle a laugh, to which she hid further under the covers. "I'm sick... you're supposed to be nice to me," she groaned.  
他试图忍住笑却失败了，她则更深地躲进了被子下面。“我生病了……你应该对我好点，”她呻吟道。_

_'I'm always nice to you', he wanted to say, but knew it wasn't true. When he was quiet, she poked her whole face out of the covers to rasp, "Make me tea."  
“我一直对你很好”，他想这么说，但知道这不是真的。当他安静下来时，她从被子里探出整张脸，沙哑地说：“给我泡茶。”_

_So he did. 于是他照做了。_

_Shinji visited her every day for the next two and half weeks. More than a few days he just skipped school to stay in her room while her father and step-mother worked, making her tea and soft foods. Asuka said he was stupid for missing school, but didn't tell him to leave. She couldn't talk very much anyway. Some days she wouldn't be able to speak at all. He never thought he would end up wishing she could. There was one evening while the sun was coming in through the other end of her room, casting his shadow on the wall next to her.  
接下来的两周半，真嗣每天都去看望她。有好几天他干脆逃学，留在她的房间里，而她的父亲和继母都在工作，他为她泡茶，做些软食。明日香说他逃学很蠢，但并没有让他离开。反正她也说不了太多话。有些日子她甚至完全无法开口。他从没想过自己会希望她能说话。有一天傍晚，阳光从她房间的另一头照进来，将他的影子投射在她的床边的墙上。_

_Fighting utter boredom, she made him fetch the charcoal he'd bought for her, and started to outline him on the wall next to her.  
为了打发极度无聊，她让他去取为她买的木炭，并开始在墙边勾勒他的轮廓。_

_He noticed, while trying to do homework, that she stopped halfway_ – _looking discontent._  
他在做作业时注意到她画到一半就停下了——看起来不太满意。

Shinji tripped stepping into the foyer. He caught himself, shaking his head as he started to climb up the oaken steps. It was odd, as a child the house had always looked so big. Now that he was older, he realized it wasn't quite a mansion, especially compared to some of the other countryside dwellings in Berlin. Still, it was a spacious home and denoted just how well off the family was.  
真嗣走进门厅时绊了一跤。他稳住自己，摇着头开始爬上橡木楼梯。这很奇怪，小时候房子总是显得那么大。现在长大了，他意识到它并不算是一座庄园，尤其是与柏林乡间其他一些住宅相比。不过，这仍然是一个宽敞的家，足以显示家族的富裕程度。

Up the stairs and down the hall to his right, he made a brief knock as he pushed the door open "Asuka? Come on, we're gonna' be late. You always–"  
上楼后向右穿过走廊，他轻轻敲了敲门便推开，“明日香？快点，我们要迟到了。你总是——”

"_Get out!_" she screeched, clutching a towel to herself.  
“出去！”她尖叫着，紧紧抓住身上的毛巾。

"I'm sorry!" he shouted, unable to stagger from the room quick enough. Something whacked against the door as he closed it, heart trying its damnedest to hammer its way out of his chest.  
“对不起！”他喊道，急忙退出房间。关门时，有什么东西砰地一声撞在门上，他的心跳得厉害，仿佛要冲出胸膛。

"Dammit, Shinji! You– you stupid idiot!"  
"该死，真嗣！你——你这个大笨蛋！"

Muffled curses echoed at him from the other side and all the awkward lessons from those sex-ed classes came flooding back, entirely without consent. He took several steps away from the door, as if that would separate him from them. Why was his face so hot? Why were his hands shaking? It was just Asuka – he hadn't seen anything. At least he didn't think he had... had he?  
从门的另一侧传来模糊的咒骂声，那些性教育课上的尴尬记忆不受控制地涌入脑海。他后退了几步，仿佛这样就能与那些记忆隔离开来。为什么他的脸这么热？为什么他的手在颤抖？这只是因为明日香——他什么都没看到。至少他认为自己没看到...他真的没看到吗？

The door swung open, revealing a fully dressed and very peeved Asuka. "What gave you the idea you could just walk into a girl's room without permission?!"  
门猛地打开，露出穿着整齐、满脸怒容的明日香。"你怎么会认为可以未经允许就闯进女孩子的房间？！"

He held his hands up. "I-I don't know, I'm sorry!"  
他举起双手。“我——我不知道，对不起！”

"Why don't you try using that peanut you call a brain next time?!" she demanded, pushing past him and storming down the hall.  
“你下次为什么不试试用你那颗所谓的花生米大脑呢？！”她质问道，推开他，怒气冲冲地沿着走廊走去。

"Asuka..." he hurried to keep pace as she thundered down the stairs. She didn't respond. "Come on, I said I was sorry."  
“明日香……”他急忙跟上她下楼的步伐。她没有回应。“拜托，我说了对不起了。”

"'Cause that just fixes everything, doesn't it?" she snapped.  
“因为那样就能解决所有问题，不是吗？”她厉声说道。

He stopped on the steps. "You barge into my room without asking all the time."  
他在台阶上停下。“你总是不问一声就闯进我的房间。”

"So? That's different," she said, bag over her shoulder. Then she realized he wasn't following. "Don't just stand there! We're gonna be late and you're already pissing me off this morning!"  
“那又怎样？这不一样，”她肩上挎着包说道。随后她意识到他没跟上来。“别光站在那儿！我们要迟到了，你今天早上已经让我很恼火了！”

Asuka turned out the door and he rushed down after her. "How is it different? And what's your problem anyway? I didn't even see anything!"  
明日香甩门而出，他紧随其后冲了下去。“有什么不同？你到底怎么了？我什么都没看到！”

"That's not the point!" she hollered, clambering into the car. They both jerked with angry movements, buckling in and then crossing their arms. Asuka crossed her legs, an added layer.  
“重点不在这里！”她吼道，爬进车里。两人都带着怒气动作粗鲁地系上安全带，然后交叉双臂。明日香还翘起了腿，多了一层姿态。

Shinji, fuming, was fine with playing their game of silence until first period. They would calm down enough by then. Berlin soon rolled into view, road humming beneath them.  
真嗣气得冒烟，他愿意玩这场沉默的游戏直到第一节课。到那时他们应该会冷静下来。柏林很快映入眼帘，道路在他们脚下嗡嗡作响。

Asuka clicked her tongue and settled back. "If it bothered you so much why didn't you say anything?"  
明日香咂了咂舌，靠回椅背。“既然这么困扰你，为什么不早说？”

"You wouldn't have cared even if it did," he said, still bitter.  
“就算说了你也不会在乎，”他依旧带着怨气说道。

"Yeah because it never bothered you, so that's a stupid argument."  
“是啊，因为你从来不在乎，所以这争论毫无意义。”

Shinji gave it up. "Whatever." she would just keep arguing with him and he didn't want to do that the whole car ride over to school. Asuka was overbearing enough without him _trying_ to get her mad. Best to just give up rather than make a big deal about it.  
真嗣放弃了。“随你怎么说。”她只会继续和他争论，而他不想在去学校的整个车程中都这样。没有他试图惹她生气，明日香已经够霸道了。最好还是放弃，而不是小题大做。

They went their separate ways at the Kloster, and Herr Wilhelm chastised him for his sloppy state of dress as he shambled into first period.  
他们在修道院分道扬镳，而威尔海姆先生责备他衣冠不整地拖着脚步走进第一节课。

That was more or less the last time he ever went to fetch her for school. It turned out waiting by the front door was much safer. Still, no matter how hard he tried, he could never quite manage to expunge the incident from his mind. Sync-training at NERV continued, and Shinji tried not to be around when Asuka was in her suit.  
那几乎是他最后一次去接她上学。事实证明，在前门等待要安全得多。尽管如此，无论他多么努力，他始终无法完全从脑海中抹去那次事件。在 NERV 的同步训练继续进行，真嗣尽量不在明日香穿上战斗服时靠近她。

---

Back in the 5th grade, Asuka was enrolled into the upper level classes, sitting with the eleventh and twelfth graders for physics and mathematics. The first year of advanced courses was, as she explained, just primer for the actual courses, which covered any subject one could imagine.  
五年级时，明日香被编入高年级班级，与十一年级和十二年级的学生一起上物理和数学课。她解释说，第一年的高级课程只是为实际课程打基础，涵盖了人们能想象到的任何科目。

He, on the other hand, was on intermediate level and intended to stay there. Just thinking about taking on all of Asuka's extra schooling made his stomach queasy. She almost seemed annoyed that he wasn't in the upper level too. As if he'd chosen to make her do it all alone. Maybe she should have stayed in the intermediate level if that's the way she felt about it.  
而他则处于中级水平，并打算留在那里。光是想到要承担明日香所有的额外学业就让他感到胃部不适。她似乎对他不在高级班感到有些恼火，仿佛是他选择让她独自面对这一切。或许如果她那么想的话，她应该留在中级班。

Ever since they'd started going to school together, grades, like everything else in their friendship, turned into a battle to outdo one another. Just last year Shinji had had the audacity to consistently gain a higher grade than her in religious doctrine, particularly on the presentations, which she didn't have patience for. What a great month of gloating that had been. She earned her comeback when he scored low on social competence for group projects.  
自从他们一起上学以来，成绩就像他们友谊中的其他一切一样，变成了相互较劲的比赛。就在去年，真嗣竟然大胆地在宗教教义课程上持续获得比她更高的分数，尤其是在她不耐烦的演讲环节。那真是一个月的大肆炫耀。她在他的社交能力因团队项目得分低时扳回一城。

Once she moved on to the upper level, he couldn't be bothered to put as much effort in. Nowadays he was, more often than not, forced to spend time in Silentium to play catchup on homework. Asuka wasn't around much to help anymore and berated him every time he complained about it.  
一旦她转战到上层，他就懒得再那么费劲了。如今他多半时间被迫待在沉默中赶作业。明日香不再常来帮忙，每次他抱怨时都会被她训斥一顿。

"_God_, you're frustrating!"  
“天啊，你真让人抓狂！”

Shinji pulled down at an eyelid. "And you're annoying."  
真嗣拉下一只眼皮。“而你很烦人。”

"I'm a princess and I'm prefect," she said, flipping her hair.  
"我是个公主，而且我完美无缺，" 她一边说，一边甩了甩头发。

"If I poked your head with a needle, would it pop?"  
"如果我用针戳你的头，它会爆吗？"

"How about I poke your ribs with my fist?!" And she did. Except it was a full-on punch, and he was laughing while she tried, desperately, to hold onto her anger instead of falling into a fit of giggles herself. His dismissive escapes didn't last, and Asuka started getting legitimately upset with him. To the point where he wouldn't hear from her for a day. Not even a text.  
"那我用拳头戳你的肋骨怎么样？！" 她真的动手了。虽然那是一记重拳，而他却在笑，她拼命试图保持愤怒，而不是自己也忍不住笑出声来。他的轻蔑逃避并未持续多久，明日香开始真的对他感到生气。到了他一整天都收不到她任何消息的地步，连条短信都没有。

Then for two weeks, she'd gone through a social internship with a hospital for the mentally ill in Bethel. The texts had been practically non-stop, and he wondered what she was even doing up there if she had time to send him so many messages. She wasn't actually an intern too, only helped the coordinator. To gain exposure, they said.  
随后的两周，她在贝瑟尔的一家精神病院进行了社会实习。她的消息几乎是接连不断，他不禁好奇，如果她有这么多时间给他发信息，那她在那里到底在做什么。她并不是真正的实习生，只是协助协调员。说是为了增加经验。

She told him how she found other things to do whenever they had to work with the patients, making it look like she was being busy inputting data, which she couldn't stand. She also hated talking to them, especially the ones with alzheimers who couldn't remember her name. She'd call him at night and they'd talk for a couple hours, or until one of them fell asleep.  
她告诉他，每当需要与患者打交道时，她总能找到其他事情做，让自己看起来像是在忙着输入数据，而她其实对此感到难以忍受。她也不喜欢与他们交谈，尤其是那些患有阿尔茨海默症、记不住她名字的患者。她会在晚上给他打电话，他们会聊上几个小时，或者直到其中一人睡着。

When Asuka got back, she hugged him for a very long moment, and vowed she'd never set foot in another hospital again.  
当明日香回来时，她紧紧拥抱了他很久，并发誓再也不踏入另一家医院。

Ilka didn't come to visit that Thanksgiving, or come to take them into Berlin for the Christmas Market. But she did write Asuka letters. At first, Shinji expected her to just tear them up and sprinkle them in the trash. Instead, she set time aside to write a letter back while lounging on his bed.  
伊尔卡那个感恩节没有来访，也没有带他们去柏林逛圣诞市场。但她确实给明日香写了信。起初，真嗣以为她会直接撕掉信件扔进垃圾桶。然而，她却特意抽出时间，躺在他的床上回信。

"I thought you didn't like talking to _Oma_ anymore?" he asked.  
“我以为你不喜欢再跟妈妈说话了？”他问道。

She shrugged. "It's not really a big deal. I'm only writing her because she's old and probably gonna' die soon."  
她耸了耸肩。“其实也没什么大不了的。我给她写信只是因为她年纪大了，可能很快就会去世。”

He knew better than that.  
他比谁都清楚这一点。

Slowly, time together became more of a rarity. Asuka had her advanced classes. He had Silentium. She made friends in a few of the upper level students – and some afternoons would be out with them, not arriving home until later in the night. It was mostly girls, and she seemed to do her best to steer clear of Shinji whenever they were around.  
渐渐地，共度的时光变得稀罕起来。明日香有她的高级课程，他有他的沉默。她在高年级学生中交了些朋友——有些下午会和他们出去，深夜才回家。大多是女生，而且她似乎尽量在她们在场时避开真嗣。

Along with that, girls started giving him looks or would giggle whenever he passed by, hands covering their mouths as they whispered to one another. He saw them differently now, unsure of what exactly had changed. A girl in one of his morning classes, Laurena, drew a lot of eyes, and many more envious looks. She had straight black hair and had started wearing a bra before any of the other girls. It was distracting.  
与此同时，女孩们开始对他投以目光，或是在他经过时窃窃私语，用手掩嘴轻笑。他现在看她们的眼光不同了，不确定究竟是什么变了。他早上的一个同班女生，劳雷娜，吸引了许多目光，还有更多嫉妒的眼神。她留着笔直的黑发，比其他女孩更早开始穿胸衣。这很让人分心。

More than that, he watched as boys from other classes would stare after Asuka. She began finding notes at her desk, ripping them up and throwing them in the trash without ever reading them. Others tried a more direct approach. One even offered her a handful of flowers, only to be turned away when she declared she didn't go out with little boys. It made his stomach churn and he wouldn't be able to focus on any of the lessons, tapping his pencil against the desk, chewing on the eraser instead when the teacher snapped at him for it.  
不仅如此，他还注意到其他班级的男生会盯着明日香看。她的课桌上开始出现情书，她总是不读就撕碎扔进垃圾桶。有些人则采取了更直接的方式。甚至有人捧着一束花向她示爱，却被她一句“我不和小男孩约会”给拒绝了。这让他心里五味杂陈，无法专心听讲，被老师训斥时，他只是用铅笔敲打着桌面，咬着橡皮头。

Between school and NERV, she didn't come over to his house all that much either. When she _did_ come to the garden, she always had her homework, making him study with her out on the back porch or by the pond.  
在学校和 NERV 之间奔波，她也不常来他家。偶尔来到花园时，她总是带着作业，让他陪她在后门廊或池塘边一起学习。

The gardens died and overgrew in places, while he watched from his small island, unable to stop the change.  
花园逐渐荒废，杂草丛生，而他只能从自己的小岛上眼睁睁看着这一切变化，无力阻止。

### Chapter 9: Firebird's Feather
"You've made very good progress Shinji," Moskva said.  
“你已经取得了很大的进步，真嗣，”莫斯科说。

The displays flickered and he frowned at the readings. "It's only 22%. Asuka's is at 40."  
显示屏闪烁着，他皱眉看着读数。“只有 22%。明日香的已经达到了 40%。”

A smirk ever so briefly graced her lips. "Did you know she's been sync-testing since she was five? It's taken her a very long time to reach that number. Besides, your rates will be much higher when the core is coupled with the actual unit."  
一丝得意的微笑在她唇边稍纵即逝。“你知道吗，她从五岁起就开始同步测试了。她花了很长时间才达到那个数字。而且，当核心与实际机体结合时，你的同步率会高得多。”

That explained some of her strange behavior when they were little kids. She'd known what piloting was way before he even had a clue. His face smarted and the plugsuit, for a moment, seemed to be made of lead. After he showered and changed, he went with Moskva down to the food court while Asuka continued her testing. Chef Montagne gave him the usual: two slices of pizza. He liked to fold them together and make a sandwich.  
这解释了她小时候一些奇怪的行为。她比他早得多就知道什么是驾驶了。他的脸颊火辣辣的，那件驾驶服在这一刻似乎重如铅块。洗完澡换好衣服后，他和莫斯科一起去了餐饮区，而明日香继续她的测试。蒙塔涅大厨照常给了他两片披萨。他喜欢把它们叠在一起，做成一个三明治。

After managing little more than a few bites, he asked, "Miss Moskva?"  
勉强吃了几口后，他问道：“莫斯科小姐？”

"Out with it, child," she said, not looking up from her PDA.  
“说吧，孩子，”她头也不抬地回答，专注于她的 PDA。

"Why are you making the Evas? Why do we have to pilot them?"  
“你们为什么要制造 Eva？我们又为何必须驾驶它们？”

"To fight beings we call Angels."  
“为了对抗我们称之为天使的生物。”

His head shot up. They read about Angels and that kind of stuff at the _Kloster_ all the time. "What are they?" he asked. In the books, they were holy messengers of God with halos and wings and all that. How could they be fighting those?  
他猛地抬起头。他们在修道院里经常读到关于天使之类的内容。“它们是什么？”他问道。在书里，天使是上帝的神圣使者，有着光环和翅膀等等。他们怎么可能与那些存在战斗呢？

Her eyes lingered on him. "No one is certain. All we know for sure is that they want to take the Earth away from us. With the Evas, we can stop that from happening."  
她的目光在他身上停留。“没有人能确定。我们唯一确知的是，他们想要从我们手中夺走地球。有了 Eva，我们就能阻止这一切发生。”

"But why me? Why Asuka?"  
“但为什么是我？为什么是明日香？”

"That's simply the way it is."  
“事情就是这样。”

_Why do I have to live here?_ Because your father has deemed it necessary.  
为什么我必须住在这里？因为你父亲认为这是必要的。

_Why do we have to learn to fight?_ To protect mankind.  
为什么我们必须学习战斗？为了保护人类。

_Why do we have to protect mankind?_ Because we have to.  
为什么我们必须保护人类？因为我们必须这么做。

Those weren't real answers. Nothing ever happened 'just because'. That couldn't be right. It was like everyone was in on some big secret – laughing at him behind his back just because he didn't know any better.  
那些都不是真正的答案。事情从不会‘只是因为’就发生。那不可能是对的。就好像每个人都在参与某个大秘密——在他背后嘲笑他，只因为他一无所知。

Misato drove them home. Asuka was chatty as they left NERV-03, but Shinji didn't want to talk to her. She kept secrets from him too.  
美里开车送他们回家。明日香在离开 NERV-03 时很健谈，但真嗣不想和她说话。她也对他隐瞒了许多秘密。

Still, he was curious now. "Misato, who's the First Child?" he'd never really asked before since it was a sore spot with Asuka. She hated being second in _anything_, but with the Evas it was worse, like when they used to spar.  
尽管如此，他现在感到好奇了。“美里，第一适任者是谁？”他以前从未真正问过，因为这对明日香来说是个痛点。她讨厌在任何事情上屈居第二，但在 EVA 上这更糟糕，就像他们过去常常比试时那样。

"I'm not sure, to be honest," she said, shrugging. "They're stationed at Headquarters, but that's about all I know."  
"老实说，我不太确定，" 她耸耸肩说，"他们驻扎在总部，但我知道的也就这些了。"

"Why don't we get to train at Headquarters too?" he asked. Shinji, at some point, assumed he'd been sent so far away just to train with Asuka. It had made him start to think that... that maybe his father might have wanted to see him after all. At least until he started hearing mentions of the First Child. Why did they get to stay at Headquarters? What made them so special? Was it because they were better at piloting?  
"为什么我们不能也在总部训练呢？" 他问道。真嗣在某一刻以为自己被派到这么远的地方只是为了和明日香一起训练。这让他开始觉得……也许他的父亲终究还是想见他的。至少在他开始听到关于第一适格者的提及之前。为什么他们能留在总部？是什么让他们如此特别？是因为他们驾驶技术更好吗？

"Couldn't say, bud. That's just the way top brass wants it."  
"这我说不准，伙计。高层就是这么决定的。"

Because it was what his father wanted. Asuka cast him a glance, seeming to consider something, but he shook his head and she let it be.  
因为这是他父亲所希望的。明日香瞥了他一眼，似乎在考虑什么，但他摇了摇头，她便不再追问。

She turned to Misato with a pout. "Wasn't I picked first, anyway?"  
她转向美里，噘着嘴说：“反正我不是第一个被选中的吗？”

"I guess not." “我想不是。”

The girl crossed her arms. "Hmph."  
女孩交叉双臂，轻哼一声。

As they arrived home, Shinji bid his friend good night, but only after a nudge from Misato.  
他们到家时，真嗣向朋友道了晚安，不过是在美里轻轻推了他一下之后。

It wasn't just about her keeping things from him. Back at the _Kloster_, everyone had started getting really excited over Asuka. But not in the usual, fawning way the research staff did at NERV. Even Mr Langley seemed to be in a better mood whenever Shinji saw him, sitting with Mrs Langley and sharing in a contented sort of pride. He couldn't peg what it was. If something important had happened, Asuka would tell him.  
这不仅仅是她对他隐瞒事情的问题。回到修道院时，每个人都开始对明日香感到异常兴奋。但并非像 NERV 的研究人员那样通常的奉承方式。甚至连兰格利先生似乎也心情大好，每当真嗣看到他时，他都和兰格利夫人坐在一起，分享着一种满足的自豪感。真嗣无法确定那是什么。如果发生了什么重要的事情，明日香会告诉他的。

Wouldn't she? 她不会吗？

He contemplated this the next day after helping Gepard apply a fresh layer of raw-red mulch beneath the roses. His hands were still a little stained, and left smears of crimson on his sketchpad.  
次日，在帮格帕德在玫瑰花下铺上一层新鲜的暗红色覆盖物后，他思考着这个问题。他的双手仍有些许染色，在素描本上留下了斑斑猩红。

Shinji didn't think himself a very good artist. Not like some of the painters at the _Kloster_, who made it seem so effortless. It was as frustrating as it was inspiring to watch. Why couldn't he have that talent? Nothing else came very easy to him, except maybe shooting and fishing. There was the cello too, but Teacher said the arts were a waste of his efforts.  
真嗣并不认为自己是个出色的艺术家。不像修道院里的一些画家，他们的技艺看似毫不费力。看着他们作画既令人沮丧又鼓舞人心。为什么他没有那样的天赋呢？除了射击和钓鱼，他做其他事都不太容易。还有大提琴，但老师说艺术是浪费他的努力。

Still, if he ever found an opportunity, he spent it trying to draw. Most of them ended up in the trash. Incomplete. Worthless. The pictures themselves survived entirely on the conté crayons Ilka bought him each year. He made them last.  
尽管如此，一旦有机会，他还是会用来尝试画画。大多数作品最终都被扔进了垃圾桶。未完成。毫无价值。这些画作能存在，全靠伊尔卡每年给他买的炭笔。他尽量让它们用得久一些。

His favorite place to set up shop was by the olive tree, just between the roots. It was secluded, and no one could find him – not even Gepard, who claimed to know the garden like the back of his hand. For most of the morning, he'd struggled with what to even try drawing. He had so little talent, what was the point?  
他最喜欢的工作地点是橄榄树旁，就在树根之间。那里隐蔽，没人能找到他——就连自称对花园了如指掌的格帕德也找不到。整个上午，他都在纠结该尝试画些什么。他天赋如此有限，画画又有什么意义呢？

But he scratched out the lines anyway, without any real thought or intent.  
但他还是随意地画着线条，没有任何真正的思考或意图。

_Angels_. He wondered what they looked like? Where they came from? He thought about these things a lot, and was never rewarded with any answers. Asuka said he was just wasting time instead of focusing on what was important, as usual. But he was. Just because she already thought she knew everything didn't mean it was true. She didn't understand anything, just like everybody else. So what if she was already in the upper level classes? What was there to like about learning useless things? What was the difference when they had to pilot the Evas?  
天使。他好奇他们长什么样？来自何方？他常常思考这些问题，却从未得到任何答案。明日香说他只是在浪费时间，而不是专注于真正重要的事情，一如既往。但他确实在思考。仅仅因为她自以为无所不知，并不意味着那就是真相。她什么都不懂，和其他人一样。就算她已经在上层班级学习又如何？学习那些无用的东西有什么好喜欢的？当他们必须驾驶 Eva 时，这又有什么区别呢？

Without realizing it, his hand began to make refined arcs and scribbled shapes. Shinji couldn't be sure what possessed him or why, but he started to draw Asuka. He wished he had some pictures to reference. Asuka hated being photographed. The only one he knew of had been taken by her step-mom and was surely lost somewhere in the house by now. So he had to go from memory alone.  
不知不觉中，他的手开始画出精致的弧线和潦草的形状。真嗣不确定是什么驱使他这样做，也不知道为什么，但他开始画明日香。他希望自己有一些照片可以参考。明日香讨厌被拍照。他唯一知道的一张照片是她继母拍的，现在肯定不知道丢在家里的哪个角落了。所以他只能凭记忆来画。

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

Shinji jumped. Asuka was leaning around the trunk of the olive tree, and he fumbled to shield his picture.  
真嗣吓了一跳。明日香正从橄榄树干后探出身来，他慌忙试图遮挡自己的画。

"Nothing! When di–" before he could sputter half a response, she lunged and yanked the sketchpad away.  
“没什么！你什么时候——”他还没来得及结巴着说完一半，她便猛地扑上来夺走了素描本。

"Hey!" he scrambled up, but she held it over her head, climbing the tree and plopping her rump on a thick branch.  
“嘿！”他急忙起身，但她把本子举过头顶，爬上树，一屁股坐在了一根粗枝上。

"Asuka!" he snarled, punching her ankle – as high as he could reach.  
"明日香！" 他咆哮着，用力捶打她的脚踝——这是他能够到的最高位置。

"I just wanna' look! Geez, what's your problem?" she snarled. His heart thundered and his face burned.  
"我只是想看看！天哪，你有什么毛病？" 她咆哮道。他的心跳如雷，脸颊发烫。

"It's private." "这是私人的。"

Asuka just stuck her tongue out, holding the drawing away to see better. Shinji latched his way up a few feet, watching her expression change. Except it was deeper than that. Like a shift, like something had fallen away. A dozen emotions passed through her bright eyes, so intense it made his anger fade.  
明日香只是伸出舌头，将画作拿远以便更好地观看。真嗣攀爬了几英尺，注视着她的表情变化。但那变化比表面更深，仿佛有什么东西脱落了。一连串的情绪在她明亮的眼睛中闪过，如此强烈以至于他的怒气都消散了。

"I don't look like this," she said, lips pursing. Slowly, she came back. Anger, annoyance – disgust.  
“我不长这样，”她抿着嘴唇说。慢慢地，她回过神来。愤怒、烦恼——厌恶。

He climbed close enough to take the sketch pad back. "You do to me," he said, jumping to the ground. He collected his contés and started for home.  
他爬得足够近，拿回了素描本。“在我眼里你是这样的，”他说着跳到地上。他收拾好炭笔，开始往家走。

Her feet scuffed behind him. "It doesn't matter what I look like to you. That isn't right."  
她的脚步在他身后拖沓着。“我在你眼里什么样并不重要。那不对。”

"Then _you_ draw yourself," her said, offering the pad. Asuka couldn't resist a challenge.  
“那你画你自己，”他说着，递过画板。明日香无法抗拒这个挑战。

She crossed her arms and he smirked, which made her glare. "I don't have to. It's called a mirror, idiot."  
她交叉双臂，他则得意地笑了，这让她瞪了他一眼。“我不需要。这叫镜子，白痴。”

Shinji huffed. "Said the girl who can't even draw a circle."  
真嗣哼了一声。“说这话的女孩连个圆都画不好。”

"Shut up," Asuka said, but it was softer. He fought not to roll his eyes. Now she was going to be all mopey and he was going to have to annoy her out of her shell until she started shouting – or laughing. Or both. She was too easy to manipulate sometimes. He followed the pathway home on autopilot, thinking of his drawing while Asuka kicked sand at his heels. It wasn't a masterpiece, but he didn't think it was that bad. It _did_ look like her. The haughty posture was there, and the proportions were mostly right; a thirteenth grader had taught him how to measure using heads. The only thing he couldn't manage were the eyes, a line cutting over the face in their place.  
“闭嘴，”明日香说道，但语气柔和了许多。他努力不让自己翻白眼。现在她又要开始闷闷不乐了，他得想办法把她从壳里逗出来，直到她开始大喊大叫——或者笑出声。或者两者都有。有时候她太容易被操控了。他沿着回家的路机械地走着，心里想着自己的画，而明日香在他脚后跟踢着沙子。那幅画虽不是杰作，但他也不觉得有那么糟糕。确实画出了她的样子。傲慢的姿态在那里，比例也大致正确；一个十三年级的学生教过他如何用头部来测量。唯一他无法处理的就是眼睛，画上只有一条线横跨在脸部。

"I wish I wasn't stuck here anymore," Asuka said, making him stop. She was leaning against the trunk of a tree, looking towards the sky with a lopsided frown. "I wish they'd just finish my Eva and send me to Headquarters already."  
“我希望我不再被困在这里，”明日香说道，让他停下了脚步。她倚靠在一棵树干上，歪着头望向天空，眉头微皱。“我希望他们能快点完成我的 EVA，然后把我送到总部去。”

Shinji had enough pause to think he should stop. "Better just leave it to the First Child. First is best, isn't it?"  
真嗣有足够的时间思考自己应该停下来。“最好还是交给第一适格者吧。第一总是最好的，不是吗？”

Asuka's expression hardened, but she didn't respond. He was still sore over what she'd said – what she'd seen. It wasn't as though he was asking for much, just a little privacy. Apparently, that was demanding too much.  
明日香的表情变得严肃，但她没有回应。他对她之前说的话——她所看到的一切——仍然感到痛心。他并没有要求太多，只是想要一点私人空间。显然，这要求也太过分了。

When she turned and left, he didn't feel a lick of remorse.  
当她转身离开时，他丝毫没有感到内疚。

As he stood there in the quiet, a forest of white birches creaked. He didn't remember coming to this part of the garden. The trees here looked sick, if it was possible for a tree to look that way; like they were on the verge of crumbling. Fit to topple at the most gentle wind. A wet, green rot sapping at the pure bark.  
他站在那片寂静中，一片白桦林在风中吱嘎作响。他不记得自己曾来到花园的这一角。这里的树木看起来病恹恹的，仿佛树木也能显露出那种病态；它们似乎即将崩塌，只需最轻柔的风就能将它们吹倒。一种湿润的、绿色的腐烂正侵蚀着纯净的树皮。

With only a flash of doubt, Shinji tore the drawing of Asuka from his pad and ripped it into a dozen pieces, letting them scatter into the sagging ferns at his feet.  
仅有一瞬间的犹豫，真嗣从画本上撕下了那张明日香的画像，将其撕成十几片，任由它们散落在脚下的下垂蕨类植物中。

Last autumn their class went up north to see St. Nikolai church.  
去年秋天，他们班北上参观了圣尼古拉教堂。

They arrived by plane in Altefähr, learning the old town's history as a ferry took them to Stralsund. It had been around since the time of the knights. One of the few places Catholics and Protestants could worship in the same place. Up until a preacher of the Dominican Order was dragged from the pulpit and beaten to death.  
他们乘飞机抵达阿尔特法赫，在前往斯特拉尔松德的渡轮上了解这座古城的历史。这座城市自骑士时代便已存在，是少数天主教徒和新教徒能在同一地点进行礼拜的地方。直到一位多明我会传教士被从讲坛上拖下并殴打致死。

Just before visiting the church they went to the _ozeaneum_ and looked at fish and underwater animals, with a special Pre-Second Impact branch on display. One exhibit had he and Asuka standing in a simply _massive_ room. Giant whales hung from the ceiling, their noses dipping down towards the floor. As though they might dive into these tiny figures far below at any moment.  
在参观教堂之前，他们先去了海洋馆，观赏鱼类和水中生物，特别展出了一个前第二次冲击的分支。其中一个展品中，他和明日香站在一个极其宽敞的房间里。巨大的鲸鱼悬挂在天花板上，鼻尖朝下指向地面，仿佛随时可能俯冲向下方渺小的身影。

"Do you think the Angels are that big?" he asked.  
“你觉得使徒有那么大吗？”他问道。

Asuka scrutinized the whales, then shook her head. "Are you kidding? They've _gotta_ be bigger than that!"  
明日香仔细打量着鲸鱼，然后摇了摇头。“你在开玩笑吧？它们肯定比这大得多！”

As they left the _ozeaneum_, she was still quivering from the sight of the squids. The sun was in the very middle of the sky, where there wasn't a cloud in sight. The church stood like a lighthouse in a sea of clay roofs.  
离开海洋馆时，她仍因看到乌贼的景象而颤抖。太阳高悬在无云的天空中，教堂宛如一座灯塔，矗立在一片黏土屋顶的海洋中。

The inside was impossibly tall, as if it were reaching to another plane. The arched ceiling was plastered in white so the light coming in through the windows made it glow. Holding it aloft were archways colored in red, blue and yellow, each pillar painted with an angel in the old medieval style. The edges were cut by gilded gold patterns, which flowed to the grand altar: layered designs of the last supper in black and aurelian. Crowning it was a crucifix, a marble-white man and woman in flowing robes standing on either side of its base. The priest said they were embodiments of hope and faith.  
内部高耸入云，仿佛触及另一个层面。拱形天花板涂成白色，阳光透过窗户照射进来，使其熠熠生辉。支撑这一切的是红、蓝、黄三色的拱门，每根柱子上都绘有中世纪风格的天使。边缘被镀金图案切割，流向宏伟的祭坛：黑色和金色交织的最后的晚餐图案。其顶端是一座十字架，大理石般洁白的男女身着飘逸长袍，分立于基座两侧。神父说他们象征着希望与信仰。

The boys ribbed one another and chortled as they explored, eyeing the naked breasts on some of the statues. Shinji caught himself staring too, glancing around every so often to make it look like he was just taking everything all in. Especially when Asuka walked up next to him, jacket slung over her shoulder.  
男孩们互相打趣，咯咯笑着探索四周，目光不时掠过一些雕像上的裸露胸部。真嗣发现自己也在盯着看，时不时环顾四周，装作只是在欣赏一切。尤其是当明日香走到他身边，肩上搭着夹克时。

"What a bunch of perverts," she said. He mumbled an agreement and tried not to look at her chest. Not that there was much there, but he wondered...  
“真是一群变态。”她说道。他含糊地附和着，尽量不去看她的胸部。虽然那里并不丰满，但他不禁好奇……

Shinji felt his cheeks warm, and found another corner of the church to explore. Away from Asuka.  
真嗣感到脸颊发热，找了个教堂的角落继续探索，远离明日香。

Afterwards they were allowed to get together in groups of three and roam about Stralsund. Asuka put herself with a pair of girls from her advanced classes, leaving him to stand there awkwardly in the crowd of students, feeling confused, and a little betrayed.  
之后，他们被允许三人一组在斯特拉尔松自由活动。明日香与她高级班的两名女生结伴而行，留下他在学生群中尴尬地站着，感到困惑，还有些被背叛的感觉。

But he spotted Marcel and invited himself into the group, already comprised of Yani and Heiko. Shinji knew the two boys well enough to call friends. He didn't really see Asuka much at the _Kloster_ anymore, so the past year he'd started hanging out with Marcel and the others, loitering by the vending machines and watching Yani make a fool of himself trying to impress girls with magic tricks.  
但他看到了马塞尔，便自顾自地加入了由亚尼和海科组成的那个小组。真嗣与这两个男孩足够熟悉，可以称得上是朋友。他现在在修道院里不怎么见到明日香了，所以过去一年他开始和马塞尔他们混在一起，在自动售货机旁闲逛，看亚尼用魔术技巧试图在女生面前出风头，结果常常是自讨苦吃。

As they all went their separate ways, he caught sight of Asuka chatting excitedly as she and the two girls flitted down the street. Most of the class went to the supermarket and bought sweets, while others went shopping.  
当他们各自散去时，他瞥见明日香正兴奋地与那两个女孩在街上穿梭交谈。大部分同学去了超市买糖果，而其他人则去购物了。

Later, they all bought ice cream and made their way back towards the port, where the ferry was waiting to leave. Back across to Altefähr they had a bit of free time and went to the beach, watching the sun set before the teachers herded them off to dinner.  
后来，他们都买了冰淇淋，一路返回港口，渡轮正等着启航。再次横渡到阿尔特法赫，他们有了点自由时间，便去了海滩，看着夕阳西下，直到老师们催促他们去吃晚饭。

They didn't have any bathing suits, so no one went swimming. The groups didn't fade much either, but he found his way to Asuka again. She was still with her other friends, Gaelle, he remembered. The other girl's name escaped him. They talked but the conversation was awkward and filled with uncomfortable pauses. Until Shinji made up an excuse to leave.  
他们没有泳衣，所以没人下水游泳。小组间的距离也没拉开多少，但他还是找到了朝香的方向。她依然和她的朋友们在一起，盖尔，他记得。另一个女孩的名字他忘了。他们交谈着，但对话尴尬，充满了令人不适的停顿。直到真嗣找了个借口离开。

The trip home was uneventful, and Asuka ended up sitting with the other girls, while he and Marcel played cards. A sour pit seemed to gnaw at his stomach the whole way.  
回家的旅途平淡无奇，朝香最终和别的女孩坐在一起，而他则和马塞尔玩牌。整个过程中，他的胃里似乎有股酸涩在啃噬。

Back home, Shinji started taking the S-bahn into Berlin by himself, ignoring Asuka's calls and making up excuses whenever he missed a text. He ignored her a few more times until she cornered him by the locker rooms. She asked him what his problem was and why he seemed to be ignoring her. But he couldn't answer honestly, and just said he wasn't feeling well. Asuka called him a liar. So they fought, traded angry texts, then started riding to school together again once they'd simmered down.  
回到家中，真嗣开始独自乘坐 S 线前往柏林，无视明日香的电话，每当错过短信时就编造借口。他几次三番地忽视她，直到她在更衣室堵住了他。她问他到底怎么了，为什么看起来在故意回避她。但他无法诚实地回答，只是说自己身体不适。明日香骂他是骗子。于是他们争吵起来，互相发送愤怒的短信，然后冷静下来后，又开始一起上学。

Things went back to normal.  
一切又恢复了正常。

_He was in the garden, standing at the edge of a clearing with a spiraling tree that grew golden apples. The sun was blinding, casting the forest around him in thin, ghostly silhouettes. A flare of color snagged his eye: a bird with orange and red feathers sat perched upon a high branch, one of the golden apples trapped in its beak. It held him under its eyes for what seemed a lifetime, before spreading its great wings and flying off with its prize. The garden started to die.  
他站在花园中，站在一片空地的边缘，那里有一棵盘旋生长着金苹果的树。阳光刺眼，将周围的森林投射出稀薄、幽灵般的轮廓。一抹色彩吸引了他的目光：一只橙红色羽毛的鸟儿栖息在高高的树枝上，嘴里叼着一个金苹果。它用目光锁定他，仿佛过了一个世纪，然后展开巨大的翅膀，带着战利品飞走了。花园开始枯萎。_

_He looked down, all at once realizing he was naked. Eyes rising to the tree again, there was a girl his age sitting amidst its thick, twisting roots. A girl with blue hair and bright crimson eyes.  
他低头一看，突然意识到自己一丝不挂。目光再次投向那棵树，只见一个与他年龄相仿的女孩坐在其粗壮扭曲的树根之间。那女孩有着蓝色的头发和明亮的赤红眼眸。_

Shinji jolted, face rising from an open book. He groaned, blinking several times and distantly registering he was lying on his stomach. A weight sat on the right side of his back, not heavy, just – _something_. He tried to move and twisted to find Asuka fast asleep, using him as a pillow.  
真嗣猛地一惊，脸从摊开的书本上抬起。他呻吟着，眨了几次眼，隐约意识到自己趴在地上。背部右侧有一种重量，不重，只是——有什么东西。他试图移动，扭头一看，发现明日香正熟睡着，把他当成了枕头。

She made a soft mewling noise as he shifted, stirring from her impromptu nap. When Asuka noticed what she was laying on, she bolted upright, giving him a sour look as she rubbed sleep from the other eye. He shrugged, pretending it didn't bother him.  
他一动，她就发出了一声轻柔的呜咽，从临时的小憩中醒来。当明日香注意到自己躺在哪里时，她猛地坐直，一边揉着另一只眼睛，一边给了他一个不悦的表情。他耸耸肩，假装不在意。

She was probably still holding a grudge over his jibe about the First Child. He'd just been thinking about a lot of stuff, and hadn't possessed the energy to deal with her even a little that afternoon. But maybe it wasn't that.  
她大概还在为他对第一子的一番嘲讽耿耿于怀。他当时只是想了很多事情，那天下午连应付她一点精力的都没有。但也许并非如此。

Something had changed. Asuka was acting different. He'd grown accustomed to her wild shifts in mood a long time ago. That was the problem; it wasn't anything like that. Over the past few weeks, she'd been quiet, thoughtful, and generally all of the things he never associated with being Asuka. Like the other day with the drawing. If anything that should have prompted a fight, or even some half-teasing taunts, but she'd just given up. Walked away, as though she were simply tired of him.  
有些事情变了。明日香的行为不同以往。他早已习惯了她情绪的剧烈波动。问题就在这里；这次并非那样。过去几周里，她变得安静、深思熟虑，完全不像他印象中的明日香。就像前几天那幅画的事。按理说这应该引发一场争吵，或是一些半开玩笑的嘲弄，但她却只是放弃了。转身离开，仿佛对他已经厌倦。

They'd made up at school. She bought his lunch and said she was sorry, but in her typical standoffish way that didn't make her sound very sorry at all. Asuka wouldn't look him in the eye either, and threw in an insult with her grumbled apology – which didn't actually involve the words "I'm sorry". That's how he knew she really meant it.  
他们在学校和好了。她给他买了午餐并说对不起，但用的是她一贯的冷淡方式，听起来一点也不诚恳。明日香也没有直视他的眼睛，还夹带着一句咕哝的道歉——实际上并没有说出“对不起”这几个字。正是这样，他才知道她是真心的。

Shinji checked the watch lying next to his book – 17:16. It had been about an hour and a half since they started, and he'd made little to no progress on his homework. It was testament to just how far he'd let his grades slip this past year. Teacher had given him a scathing lecture some months ago. Truth be told, Shinji just didn't care anymore. Piloting was the only thing he was here for, so long as he kept doing that, he had a feeling no one really cared how well he did in school.  
真嗣瞥了一眼躺在书旁的手表——17:16。他们开始已经一个半小时了，他的作业却几乎毫无进展。这足以证明过去一年他的成绩下滑得有多严重。几个月前，老师曾对他进行了一番严厉的训斥。说实话，真嗣已经不在乎了。驾驶 EVA 是他留在这里的唯一理由，只要他继续做这件事，他觉得没人真正关心他在学校的成绩如何。

"I'm leaving for University in two weeks," Asuka said.  
“我两周后就要去上大学了，”明日香说道。

His head shot up, and he probably looked like a gasping fish. "What?"  
他猛地抬起头，看起来可能像是一条喘不过气的鱼。“什么？”

She flicked hair from her face, absorbed in her work. "They're still going to have me come to NERV, but I'll be living on campus."  
她拂去脸上的发丝，全神贯注于工作。“他们还是会让我去 NERV，但我将住在校园里。”

"Oh," he said, chewing on the eraser of his pencil. The drone of the cicadas reigned for a while as he waited for her to continue, but she just kept scrawling notes.  
“哦，”他说着，咬着铅笔上的橡皮。蝉鸣声持续了一会儿，他等待她继续说下去，但她只是不停地写着笔记。

"How far is it?" he finally asked.  
“有多远？”他终于问道。

"Down south in Baden-Württemberg. Heidelberg."  
"南部的巴登-符腾堡州。海德堡。"

He struggled to summon a mental image. Baden-Württemberg was a south-western state bordering Switzerland, nearly a six hour drive. Maybe an hour by plane. He waited for further explanation, but none came.  
他努力在脑海中勾勒出这个地方的形象。巴登-符腾堡是西南部的一个州，与瑞士接壤，开车几乎需要六个小时。或许乘飞机只需一个小时。他等待着进一步的解释，但没有等到。

"Uh, which school?" he ventured, trying to ignore the growing ache in his stomach.  
"呃，哪所学校？" 他试探性地问道，试图忽视胃部逐渐加剧的疼痛。

Her nose twitched with a sneer. "What other top Universities do you know of in Heidelberg?"  
她的鼻子因嘲笑而微微抽动。“你还知道海德堡有哪些顶尖大学？”

"I don't know... it was just a question."  
“我不知道... 只是随口一问。”

"Look, just... stop talking, okay?" she asked quietly, almost looking him in the eyes. She didn't wait for acknowledgment, phasing him out as just another part of the scenery. He wished that didn't sting, but he indulged her anyway. If only because she'd genuinely asked it of him instead of turning it into a command.  
"“听着，就... 别说了，好吗？”她轻声问道，几乎正视他的眼睛。她没有等待他的回应，将他视为风景的一部分。他希望这不会刺痛自己，但还是顺从了她。只因她是真心请求而非命令。”

Shinji stared down at his textbook for a while, the problems becoming incomprehensible jumbles of numbers and letters. The dream swirled about his thoughts, ripe with the orange bird flying off with a golden apple.  
真嗣盯着他的教科书看了一会儿，那些题目变成了难以理解的数字和字母的混杂。梦境在他的思绪中盘旋，充满了那只橙色的鸟带着金苹果飞走的画面。

---

Those two weeks passed by in a blur of terse homework sessions, tests at NERV and monotonous days at the _Kloster_. Now he, Asuka, her parents, and Misato were pulling up to the Berlin Tegel Airport: tiered window facades stacked atop concrete platforms, a lone multi-level tower reaching high above it to preside over the runways.  
那两周在紧张的家庭作业、NERV 的测试和克洛斯特单调的日子中匆匆而过。现在他和明日香、她的父母以及美里正驶向柏林泰格尔机场：层层叠叠的窗户立面堆叠在混凝土平台上，一座孤立的多层塔楼高高耸立其上，俯瞰着跑道。

Finding parking below, they made their way out of the yellow-tinged halls and up into the smooth, pristine corridors built for massive amounts of people it would never accommodate.  
在下方找到停车位后，他们穿过泛黄的大厅，来到了为容纳大量人群而建却从未真正容纳过的光滑、洁净的走廊。

They picked up her ticket, transferred her luggage and passed through security. All the while Asuka hovered close to him. The air in the wide corridors was cold, but smelled fresh and echoed with a hundred voices.  
他们取了她的机票，托运了行李，通过了安检。整个过程中，明日香一直紧贴着他。宽敞的走廊里空气冰冷，却带着清新的气息，回荡着无数人的声音。

All too soon they arrived at the proper concourse and it dawned on him that she was actually leaving. He felt stupid only getting anxious about it now. It just hadn't seemed real until this moment – with Asuka standing in front of the terminal, carry-on in hand.  
转眼间他们就到了正确的登机口，他这才意识到她真的要离开了。直到此刻，他才感到焦虑，觉得自己反应迟钝。直到明日香站在航站楼前，手里提着随身行李，这一切才显得真实。

They stood side by side near the gate. Outside the tall floor-to-ceiling windows the plane was already docked. Asuka stared down the long, narrow path leading within. She was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved maroon shirt for the trip. Even though they were the same height, he'd never seen her look quite so small as she did in that moment, her free hand balled tight into a fist. It was like they were little kids again.  
他们并肩站在登机口附近。透过高大的落地窗，可以看到飞机已经停靠。明日香凝视着通往机舱的长长通道。她穿着牛仔裤和一件长袖的栗色衬衫。尽管他们身高相同，但他从未见过她像此刻这般显得如此娇小，空着的那只手紧紧握成拳头。仿佛他们又回到了孩童时代。

He realized now just how little time they'd spent together before she had to leave. She'd even been given a week off from school. It was pointless for her to go there anymore – not since she was going to college. As far as he knew, she'd been home the whole time, but hadn't come by the garden. He told himself she was just busy getting ready for the move. Shinji could've gone to see her, but... no, if Asuka wanted his company, she sought it out. She would find him, like she always did. It didn't work the other way around.  
他现在才意识到，他们在一起的时间是多么短暂，她甚至请了一周的假不去学校。她再去那里已经没有意义了——毕竟她即将上大学。据他所知，她一直在家，却没来过花园。他告诉自己，她只是忙于准备搬家。真嗣本可以去见她，但……不，如果明日香想要他的陪伴，她会主动找他。她总会找到他，像往常一样。反过来却行不通。

The gate clerk called for boarding. A feeling of dread welled up from his gut, quivering in his chest. Asuka hesitated in front of her father who, for once, looked utterly displaced. Awkwardly, he held out his hand to her, and she took it with the same slow, half-tempered movements. It was a bit like a cat and dog trying to figure out what to do with one another. Stepping back, Asuka gave her step-mother little more than a nod, exchanging brief goodbyes and forced well-wishes with them both.  
登机口的工作人员开始呼叫登机。一股恐惧感从他的腹部涌起，颤抖着传到胸口。明日香在她父亲面前犹豫不决，而这一次，她的父亲看起来完全不知所措。他笨拙地向她伸出手，她以同样缓慢、半心半意的动作握住了它。这有点像猫和狗试图弄清楚该如何相处。明日香退后一步，对她继母只是微微点头，与他们两人简短地告别，勉强地互祝好运。

Then she turned to him, expression a mask that hid the Asuka he rarely saw underneath, betrayed by the way she bit her lower lip.  
然后她转向他，表情如面具般掩盖了那个他很少见到的明日香，从她咬住下唇的方式中泄露出来。

"I guess I'll, see you around," he said, all of the practiced words falling out of his head.  
"我想我会，再见到你的，"他说，所有练习过的话语都从脑海中溜走了。

She shrugged, "probably not. I'm taking a lot of prep classes, and everything, so..."  
她耸耸肩，"可能不会。我在上很多预科课程，还有其他事情，所以..."

"Oh, right," he said, bouncing on his heels. One of her arms reached over to grab the other. "I'll, uh, just call you then."  
"哦，对，"他踮起脚尖跳了跳。她的一只手臂伸过去抓住另一只。"那我就，呃，到时候给你打电话。"

Asuka adjusted her bag and nodded. "Okay."  
明日香调整了一下背包，点了点头。"好的。"

Another knotted moment melted by, and a resolution passed through her eyes. She dropped her bag and pulled him into a hug, squeezing him so tight he thought his rib-cage might snap. He hugged her back, not caring that her hair was making his nose itch or that Misato might tease him later.  
又一个纠结的时刻悄然消融，她的眼中闪过一丝决断。她放下背包，紧紧地抱住了他，用力之大让他觉得自己的肋骨都要断了。他回抱了她，不在乎她的头发让他的鼻子发痒，也不在乎美里之后可能会取笑他。

Before the embrace could last for long, she pushed him away, a false smile touching her lips. "I'll see you when I come home, dork."  
拥抱还没持续多久，她就推开了他，嘴角挂着一抹假笑。"我回家时再见，笨蛋。"

He tried to smile back. "Yeah."  
他试图回以微笑。“嗯。”

She hefted her carry-on and waited in line as the passengers handed over their tickets. He watched her march down the ramp, quickly disappearing behind a horde of strangers.  
她提起手提行李，排队等候乘客们递交机票。他看着她沿着坡道大步走去，很快消失在一群陌生人之中。

She looked back and he waived. "Bye, Asuka!" he called. She turned away without a smile and without a word.  
她回头望了一眼，他挥了挥手。“再见，明日香！”他喊道。她转过身去，没有微笑，也没有言语。

---

It was odd at first, not having Asuka around. Half the time he expected to stumble across her in the garden or for her to show up in his room. School days seemed to crawl by at a snail's pace, and the nights felt longer with his testing at NERV in the late afternoon.  
起初，没有明日香在身边感觉很奇怪。一半的时间里，他总以为会在花园里偶遇她，或者她会突然出现在他的房间。学校的日子似乎像蜗牛爬行一样缓慢，而夜晚则因 NERV 的下午测试而显得更长。

Shinji figured he'd be able to see her there at some point, but that was impossible because of her schedule at University. She only flew in a few times a month for sync-testing and when she did, it was in the morning while he was at school, gone by the time he arrived in the evening.  
真嗣以为他总能在那里见到她，但由于她在大学的日程安排，这变得不可能。她每月只飞回来几次进行同步测试，而且总是在早上他上学时进行，等他傍晚到达时她已经离开了。

But they texted one another frequently. She lived on campus with a NERV-assigned guardian instead of another student. She sent a lot of pictures of him, and was usually in them too – bright and smiling while clinging to his arm. He was a tall Japanese man, but young like Misato and liked to tie his long hair back in a tail. She told him his name was Kaji, and on their rare phone calls went into excited detail about their many trips around Heidelberg.  
但他们经常互发短信。她住在校园里，由一名 NERV 指定的监护人而不是其他学生陪同。她发了很多他的照片，通常她也在其中——明亮地笑着，紧紧抓着他的手臂。他是一个高大的日本男人，但像美里一样年轻，喜欢把长发扎成马尾。她告诉他他的名字叫加持，在难得的电话中兴奋地详细描述了他们在海德堡的许多旅行。

Shinji, on the other hand, didn't have much to talk about, and their conversations turned into a one-sided affair, where he mostly resorted to grunting whenever she brought up Kaji. Which was most of the time.  
另一方面，真嗣没什么可聊的，他们的对话变成了单方面的交流，每当她提起加持时，他大多只能发出哼哼声。这种情况几乎占据了大部分时间。

When Shinji complained to Misato about how he was all she ever talked about, the woman closed off from him. He realized that he must be annoying her, so their car rides became silent ventures, and he tried to keep talk to a minimum, even if she attempted to start a conversation. Maybe he was a little bitter, too.  
当真嗣向美里抱怨她总是只谈论他时，她对他封闭了心扉。他意识到自己一定让她感到厌烦，于是他们的车程变得沉默寡言，即使她试图开启话题，他也尽量少说话。也许他也有点苦涩。

Then she tried making their talk about NERV, but he really didn't care. Up until she yanked his phone away.  
后来她试图把话题转向 NERV，但他真的不感兴趣。直到她突然抢走了他的手机。

"Hey!" he snapped, then shrank back at the look on her face.  
"嘿！" 他厉声说道，随即在她脸上的表情前退缩了。

"Are you even listening to me?" she asked, brow knit. "What's gotten into you lately?"  
"你到底有没有在听我说话？" 她皱着眉头问，"你最近怎么了？"

He slumped against the seat, glaring sullenly out the window. "Nothing," he sighed.  
他颓然靠在座位上，闷闷不乐地盯着窗外。"没什么，" 他叹了口气。

Misato pulled over to the side of the road and threw the car into park. Sighing, she killed the engine. Darkness washed over them. He watched a minute tick by on the digital clock while she toyed with his phone in her lap.  
美里将车靠边停下，挂上停车档。她叹了口气，熄灭了引擎。黑暗笼罩了他们。他看着数字时钟上走过一分钟，而她则在腿上摆弄着他的手机。

"Look, I'm sorry, kiddo," she said, glancing over at him. Her lips pressed together. "I know you were just... trying to talk with me, and... I mean... Kaji... he was an old boyfriend, and I try not to think about him if I can help it. Okay?"  
“听着，对不起，孩子，”她瞥了他一眼说道，嘴唇紧抿。“我知道你只是……想和我聊聊，而且……我是说……加持……他是个前男友，而我尽量不去想他，如果我能控制的话。好吗？”

Shinji was really starting to not like this Kaji person. Misato held his phone out. "Friends?"  
真嗣对这个加持越来越没好感了。美里把手机递给他。“朋友？”

He stared at it for a minute, then took it back and nodded. "Okay."  
他盯着它看了一会儿，然后接过来点了点头。“好吧。”

After that, Misato occasionally brought him over to her flat for chocolate and overcooked rice, throwing on some cheap movie she'd picked up at the convenience store down the block. As the night progressed, more beer cans were added to her collection on the floor and he'd pretend not to notice the bras scattered about with her dirty clothes.  
在那之后，美里偶尔会带他去她的公寓，一起吃巧克力和煮得过头的米饭，还会放一些她在街角便利店买的廉价电影。随着夜晚的深入，地板上多了几罐啤酒，而他则假装没注意到散落一地的胸罩和她脏衣服混在一起。

At home, Shinji started caring for the garden more – planting flowers, clearing out weeds, uprooting rogue trees. He told Asuka about all that, as boring as she might find it. Eventually, Mr Langley led him out to the estate's tool shed and gave him free reign. On occasion, the man came out into the cool, dewy mornings with him to tend the roses or set in new stones. They worked apart and in silence.  
在家中，真嗣开始更加用心地打理花园——种花、除草、拔除野树。他把这些都告诉了明日香，尽管她可能会觉得无聊。最终，兰格利先生带他去了庄园的工具棚，让他自由发挥。偶尔，这位先生会在凉爽、露水未干的清晨与他一起出来照料玫瑰或安置新石头。他们各自默默地工作。

Day by day, Shinji waited on Asuka's calls less and less. Slowly, the gaps between texts grew longer too.  
日子一天天过去，真嗣对明日香电话的期待越来越少。渐渐地，短信之间的间隔也变得更长了。

He found himself thinking of Erika again too. He'd managed to forget about her for a while, despite seeing her every now and then at school. Recently he'd spotted her latched to the arm of some brown-haired boy. She avoided his eyes, pretending he wasn't there, while the boy caught him staring after her and sent him a smarmy smile and a wink. That's when he realized it was Günter, and started entertaining fantasies of crushing his pearly teeth in.  
他也发现自己再次想起了艾丽卡。尽管在学校偶尔会见到她，他曾设法暂时忘记了她。最近他看到她挽着某个棕发男孩的手臂。她避开他的目光，假装他不存在，而那男孩注意到他盯着她看，便回以一个得意的微笑和眨眼。那时他才意识到那是冈瑟，并开始幻想将他那珍珠般的牙齿碾碎。

It wasn't long before he started to look forward to tests at NERV. If only to be away from the garden and the _Kloster_.  
不久之后，他开始期待在 NERV 的测试。只要能远离花园和修道院，他都乐意。

"You miss her, don't you?" Misato asked.  
"你想她了，对吧？" 美里问道。

Her voice tore his mind back to the present, where he stood near the Testing Chambers. He held back a grimace. She must have seen him staring at Asuka's simulation Eva.  
她的声音将他的思绪拉回到现实，他站在测试室附近。他强忍住一个苦笑。她一定是看到他盯着明日香的模拟 EVA 了。

"Not really." It sounded unconvincing, even to him. The echoing void of the corridor settled between them, muffled words from the control room slipping through.  
"并没有。" 这话听起来连他自己都觉得不令人信服。走廊的回声在他们之间沉淀，控制室里模糊的话语悄然传来。

"I have to go back to Headquarters again," she said. He shrugged, not meeting her eyes.  
"我得再回总部一趟，"她说。他耸耸肩，没有看她。

When he didn't respond, she fidgeted. "I won't be gone very long... hey, look at me," she reached out, a finger nudging his chin. He knocked it away.  
他没回应，她有些不安。"我不会离开太久的……嘿，看着我，"她伸出手，用手指轻轻碰了碰他的下巴。他一把将她的手拍开。

"_Fine_," she sighed, boots clacking along the grated floor as she left his side for the control booth. The test flew by that night and soon he was back home, politely greeting Teacher as he padded to his room.  
"好吧，"她叹了口气，靴子在格栅地板上发出清脆的响声，她离开他身边走向控制室。那晚的测试很快就结束了，不久他就回到了家，礼貌地向老师打了个招呼，然后悄悄走进自己的房间。

On the chair he used for cello practice was Misato's red beret, hanging off the back rest. He batted the thing to the floor and sat, long minutes spent with his hands balled atop his knees. His gaze found the cello case on the floor – and without remembering taking it out, he was tightening the pegs and testing the notes.  
他用于练习大提琴的椅子上挂着美里红色的贝雷帽，帽檐搭在椅背上。他轻轻一拍，帽子便落到了地上，然后坐下，双手紧握膝盖，久久凝视。他的目光落在了地板上的大提琴盒上——还没意识到自己何时取出的，他已经开始旋紧弦轴，试奏音符。

The humming chords became a nightly ritual. It made him think of his and Asuka's old practice sessions with Hanover. She played the violin, or she used to. He couldn't be sure if she still played now. They hadn't talked in a few weeks, and he never really knew what she actually did at University outside of her courses. If there was ever anything she did _without_ Kaji. His last few responses had been simple or one-worded.  
哼唱和弦成了他每晚的例行公事。这让他想起了和明日香与汉诺威的旧日练习时光。她拉小提琴，或者曾经拉过。他不确定她现在是否还在拉。他们已经几周没有交谈了，他从未真正了解她在大学里除了课程之外的实际活动。如果有什么是她不与加持一起做的。他最近的几封回信都简短或仅有一词。

In the following days he received a special summons. Another letter with the red fig leaf NERV liked to use. He knew then that it was from his father. It took him an hour to work up the courage to open it. As before, it was an artificial message, informing him he was to meet the Commander at the Old Tokyo Burial Grounds in one week for the anniversary of his mother's death.  
接下来的几天里，他收到了一份特别的召集令。又一封带有 NERV 惯用的红色无花果叶标志的信件。他立刻明白这是来自他父亲的。他花了整整一个小时鼓起勇气打开它。如往常一样，这是一封格式化的信息，通知他一周后在旧东京墓地与指挥官会面，以纪念他母亲的忌日。

Misato came back right around then. It hadn't been long before he found himself wishing he'd said goodbye. He could never manage to stay mad at her for long.  
那时美里刚好回来了。没过多久，他就发现自己希望当时能说声再见。他总是无法长久地对她生气。

His sync-test scores continued to rise as normal, fluctuating by a point or two every week. According to Moskva it wouldn't be long before he surpassed Asuka. He thought of telling her, wondering if she'd stop talking to him altogether if she knew. She'd always coveted the spotlight as the top pilot. Maybe she'd already found out. But he couldn't ask her if that was the case. More and more he felt like there wasn't much he could actually talk to her about.  
他的同步测试分数一如既往地上升，每周波动一两分。据莫斯科说，他很快就会超过明日香。他想过告诉她，想知道如果她知道了会不会完全不理他。她一直渴望成为顶尖驾驶员的光环。也许她已经发现了。但他不能问她是否如此。他越来越觉得，实际上能和她聊的话题并不多。

Teacher gave up hounding him on his lessons, sparing him little more than a disappointed frown while reading his report cards at the dinner table. Soon, Shinji dedicated himself completely to improving his sync-rates, much to Moskva's glowing satisfaction. A word he thought he'd never use with her. His life outside the base became increasingly quiet, muted even. He stopped seeing his old friends by the vending machines, and rarely spent a moment apart from his SDAT.  
老师放弃了对他功课的纠缠，只是在晚餐桌上看着成绩单时皱了皱眉，显得有些失望。不久，真嗣全身心投入到提高同步率中，这让莫斯科非常满意。他原以为自己永远不会用这样的词来形容她。他在基地外的生活变得越来越安静，甚至有些沉闷。他不再去自动贩卖机旁见老朋友，也很少离开他的 SDAT 片刻。

---

It wasn't that Shinji was unfamiliar with crying. In fact, he was probably a closer acquaintance to it than most, the exception this time being that he wasn't the one shedding tears. He simply couldn't stand the sound of someone else breaking – crumbling under whatever pressure they tried to keep bottled up inside. The girl certainly wasn't crying because of him, leaning against the side of Building A while her shoulders shook with quiet sobs. It took a lot to do that to someone.  
并非新治不熟悉哭泣。事实上，他可能比大多数人更了解这种情感，但这次不同的是，他并非流泪的那个人。他只是无法忍受别人崩溃的声音——在试图压抑内心压力下碎裂的声音。那女孩靠在 A 栋建筑旁，肩膀因低声啜泣而颤抖，显然哭泣并非因他而起。要做到这一点，需要很大的勇气。

So it shouldn't have been surprising that he was thinking of turning back the other way and just forgetting about it. Even as he considered this course of action, Shinji found that his feet were cemented to the spot. He had lingered too long, giving the guilt a chance to wriggle into his veins and fester under his skin. Maybe it was something else, though. A nebulous, black thought lingering just beyond the scope of his consciousness. A simple, yet unshakable need for something he couldn't give a name to, let alone a reason.  
因此，他考虑转身离开，假装这一切从未发生，这并不令人意外。然而，就在他思考这一行动时，新治发现自己的双脚如同被水泥固定在原地。他停留得太久，让愧疚有机会钻入他的血管，在皮肤下溃烂。或许还有其他原因，一个模糊、黑暗的念头，徘徊在他意识边缘之外。一种简单却无法摆脱的需求，他甚至无法给它命名，更不用说找到理由。

"Erika?" he asked, glad his voice didn't shake, but swallowing just in case the golfball-sized lump in his throat was actually choking him. Turning away, she didn't answer, a hand pushing blonde locks from her face. She sniffed and wiped tears from her red eyes.  
"艾丽卡？" 他问道，庆幸自己的声音没有颤抖，但还是咽了口唾沫，以防喉咙里那颗高尔夫球大小的硬块真的让他窒息。她转过身去，没有回答，一只手将金色的发丝从脸上拨开。她吸了吸鼻子，擦去通红眼睛里的泪水。

Shinji cast a glance in the direction of the main courtyard, catching students making their way back to class before the after lunch bell rang. "Are... you okay?"  
真嗣朝主庭院的方向瞥了一眼，看到学生们正赶在午饭后铃声响起前返回教室。"你还好吗？"

"Why do _you_ care?" she snapped, even a baleful glare failing to disguise her hurt. As if making some subconscious effort to escape, his right foot took a step towards the courtyard.  
"你为什么在乎？" 她厉声说道，即使一个恶狠狠的瞪视也无法掩饰她的痛苦。仿佛在某种潜意识的驱使下，他的右脚朝庭院迈了一步。

Shifting his schoolbag, he fixed his eyes on her shoes and asked, "Where's Günter?"  
他调整了一下书包，目光锁定在她的鞋子上，问道：“君特去哪儿了？”

The tears had stopped flowing and her hands folded behind her back, a few pitiable sniffs sounding as she stared at the ground. "He broke up with me."  
泪水已止，她双手背在身后，几声可怜的抽泣声中，她盯着地面说：“他和我分手了。”

Shinji imagined saying words that were deep and meaningful, thought of somehow lifting her spirits, assuaging his guilt at even considering the idea of walking the other way.  
真嗣想象着说出一些深刻而有意义的话，想着如何提振她的情绪，减轻自己甚至考虑过转身离开的愧疚感。

"Oh," he said. "哦，" 他说道。

The cicadas screamed, clouds fleeing the rays of the sun and letting them spill over the _Kloster_. Erika was caught in the shade of the building while his dark uniform soaked up every ounce of heat, sweat starting to form as his skin baked. He stepped closer until he was covered beneath the thick shadow too. The brick was cool as he leaned his back against it.  
蝉声尖锐，云朵逃离阳光的照射，任其洒满修道院。埃里卡站在建筑的阴影中，而他深色的制服吸收着每一丝热量，汗水开始在皮肤上形成。他走近了些，直到也被那浓密的阴影所覆盖。当他将背部靠在砖墙上时，感受到砖块的凉意。

"You're going to be late for the bell," Erika said, still staring at the bed of white rocks beneath them.  
"你快要赶不上铃声了，" 埃里卡说道，依旧盯着他们脚下的白色石子床。

"It's fine. I don't really care."  
"没事，我其实不太在意。"

The bustle of students faded, peace reigning over the schoolyard again. Brakes squealed down the road from the _Kloster_, hundreds of vehicles passing through Berlin echoing to them as nothing but a dull roar. Shinji jumped when the bell finally sounded, his fate in Headmistress Bayern's office sealed.  
学生们的喧嚣渐渐消散，校园再次恢复了宁静。从修道院方向传来的刹车声，在柏林穿行的数百辆车辆，对他们来说不过是低沉的轰鸣。当铃声终于响起时，真嗣吓了一跳，他在校长拜恩女士办公室的命运已然注定。

"Where's Asuka?" Erika asked, straightening her skirt as she sat. High above them the clouds moved to cover the sun, which was doing its best to scorch through again.  
"明日香在哪儿？" 艾丽卡问道，一边整理着裙子坐下。在他们头顶上方，云层移动着遮住了太阳，而太阳正竭尽全力再次穿透云层。

"She left for university in Heidelberg."  
"她去海德堡上大学了。"

Her eyes bulged. "But she's only eleven!"  
她的眼睛瞪得大大的。“但她才十一岁啊！”

"Yeah..." he forced a chuckle. "She's pretty smart."  
"是啊..." 他勉强笑了笑。"她非常聪明。"

When the quiet came again, sapping his lasting will to potentially leave, he sat down next to her, their shoulders and knees separated by scant inches. He tried, for minutes that moved as slow as the purposeless clouds above, to think of something to say or talk about. At the very least, Erika wasn't crying anymore.  
当寂静再次降临，削弱了他可能离开的最后意志时，他坐在她旁边，两人的肩膀和膝盖仅隔着几英寸。他试图在那些如同头顶无目的漂浮的云朵般缓慢流逝的分钟里，想出一些话来说或聊些什么。至少，艾丽卡不再哭泣了。

What should he do now?  
他现在该怎么办？

A sneeze echoed along the shade, drawing two pairs of eyes down the length of brick, where the tail end of a black jacket stuck out from the wall.  
一声喷嚏在阴凉处回响，吸引了两双眼睛沿着砖墙的长度望去，只见一件黑色夹克的尾部从墙后伸出。

"Swina? Is that you?" Erika asked, standing. The figure flinched and, shoulders drooping, came out from around the corner. Shinji blinked once, then twice at the sight of his old bully Scharnhorst.  
"斯维娜？是你吗？" 埃里卡站起身问道。那身影一颤，肩膀下垂，从角落里走了出来。真嗣眨了眨眼，然后又眨了眨，看到他曾经的欺负者沙恩霍斯特。

Erika's head quirked. "What are you doing out here?"  
埃里卡歪了歪头。"你在这里做什么？"

"I could ask you the same," Swina mumbled, sullen as his eyes fixed on Shinji.  
"我也可以问你同样的问题，" 斯维娜咕哝着，阴沉地盯着真嗣。

They shared a glance, then she asked, "Are you gonna' tell on us?"  
他们交换了一个眼神，然后她问道：“你要告发我们吗？”

He shrugged, looking off towards the main building. Shinji's eyebrows dipped and he imagined his fist sinking into the boy's cheek. While he wasn't one of the kids that had beaten him up, he might as well have.  
他耸了耸肩，目光投向主楼。真嗣的眉头紧锁，想象着自己的拳头砸在那男孩的脸上。虽然他不是那些打过他的孩子之一，但也差不多了。

Erika settled in the bed of rocks again. "Well, you'll only get in trouble anyway if you go back to class now, you might as well sit with us."  
埃丽卡再次坐回了那堆石头上。“反正你现在回去上课也只会惹麻烦，不如和我们一起坐吧。”

Shinji's anger evaporated, heart sinking at the very suggestion. Those eyes of hers were focused on Swina, waiting for an answer. The boy swayed on the balls of his heels and Shinji thought he might topple over at any moment. Without so much as a word, Swina crunched along the rocks and planted himself down on the other side of Erika. As the boy sat, she cast Shinji a glance and there was something mischievous in her eyes as they flitted between them.  
真嗣的怒气瞬间消散，心中一沉，只因这提议本身。她的目光紧盯着斯温娜，等待着回答。男孩踉跄着，脚跟不稳，真嗣觉得他随时可能摔倒。斯温娜一言不发，踩着碎石走到埃丽卡的另一侧坐下。男孩坐下时，她瞥了真嗣一眼，眼中闪烁着一丝顽皮，目光在他们之间游移。

"Hey, you two aren't friends, right?"  
“嘿，你们俩不是朋友吧？”

Shinji fought to keep his expression neutral, but a scowl jerked free anyway. "He called me a slant-eye."  
真嗣努力保持表情平静，但还是忍不住皱起了眉头。“他叫我斜眼。”

Erika grabbed Swina's right arm by the wrist, then Shinji's. It was so sudden neither of them could pull away before she had their hands hovering a few inches apart.  
埃丽卡抓住斯温娜的右手腕，接着是真嗣的。这一切来得如此突然，以至于他们都没能及时抽回手，两人的手便悬停在相距几英寸的地方。

"Shake hands," she said, making it sound like a friendly suggestion instead of an order. She let go of their wrists and the two boys shared a hard stare. Shinji thought of Erika crying earlier, wondering if it would make her sad again if he refused. He snatched Swina's hand and the boy jerked. Once he realized he wasn't about to be mauled, he became resolute, larger fingers squeezing back. Neither of them really shook, holding their grip as tight as possible instead. They didn't loosen for a long minute. To do so might be a sign of weakness. Eventually, through some unspoken means only known to boys, they each decided to let go at the same time.  
"握手吧，"她说道，语气听起来像是个友好的建议而非命令。她松开了他们的手腕，两个男孩交换了一个严厉的眼神。真嗣想起埃丽卡之前哭泣的样子，心想如果他拒绝，会不会让她再次伤心。他猛地抓住斯温娜的手，对方一惊。意识到自己不会被攻击后，斯温娜变得坚定起来，更粗的手指也紧握回去。他们并没有真正摇晃，而是尽可能紧地握住对方的手。很长一段时间内都没有松开。这样做可能会被视为软弱。最终，通过只有男孩们才知道的某种无声方式，他们同时决定放手。

"There," Erika said, triumphant. "That means you can't fight. You made an agreement to be friends."  
"好了，"埃丽卡得意地说，"这意味着你们不能再打架了。你们已经达成协议，要成为朋友。"

It was that simple for her. The three of them missed class for the rest of the day, talking about anything and everything that came to mind. It was nice when, over the next few hours, Erika was laughing.  
对她来说，就是这么简单。他们三人逃掉了剩下的课，无所不谈。接下来的几个小时里，看到 Erika 笑得那么开心，真是件美好的事。

For a little while, Shinji was able to forget that tomorrow he wasn't allowed to be twelve years old anymore. He would have to be grown up again, because tomorrow he was going to see his mother and father.  
有那么一会儿，真嗣能够暂时忘记明天他不能再当十二岁的小孩了。他必须再次长大成人，因为明天他要见他的父母。

###  Chapter 10: Scorched 焦土
If Shinji squinted from the graveyard visitor's hub – planted where the town of Isesaki once stood – he could just barely make out the water-filled crater from the nuclear bomb dropped twelve years ago. From Takasaki and all the way to the flooded coast, nothing remained of Old Tokyo but rolling swells of dry, orange earth. Firestorms from the blast had consumed everything within reach. Rampant flames burned for weeks while Japan's shell-shocked rescue teams struggled to put them out, resulting in thousands of casualties atop the 30 million already suffered.  
如果真嗣从墓地访客中心眯眼望去——那里曾是伊势崎镇的所在地——他勉强能看到十二年前核弹爆炸留下的水坑。从高崎一直到被淹没的海岸，旧东京只剩下滚滚的干橙色土地。爆炸引发的火风暴吞噬了一切可触及之物。肆虐的火焰燃烧了数周，而日本惊魂未定的救援队伍艰难地试图扑灭它们，导致在已有的 3000 万伤亡之上又增加了数千人。

A part of him couldn't help but think it was appropriate that the graveyard dedicated to the lives snuffed out during and after Second Impact would also be at the edges of the old capital. A more real reminder of the tragedy than any memorial would've been. It was far from the epicenter and any actual risk of exposure to radiation, or so he had been told. There was no point in using the land for anything else, half-flooded and decaying. The living had become a part of it, their ashes meshed with the arid soil.  
他的一部分不禁觉得，这个纪念第二次冲击前后逝去生命的墓地位于旧都边缘，颇为恰当。这比任何纪念碑都更真实地提醒着那场悲剧。它远离震中，也没有实际的辐射暴露风险，至少他是这么被告知的。这片半淹没、正在腐烂的土地已无他用。生者的骨灰与干涸的土壤交融，成为了它的一部分。

Misato tugged at the shoulders of Shinji's school uniform jacket, straightening his tie a little too. He would've protested, perhaps grumbled a little, but even that seemed like an exhaustive effort today.  
美里拉了拉真嗣校服外套的肩部，还顺手整了整他的领带。他本想抗议，或许还会咕哝几句，但今天连这样的举动都显得格外费力。

"Stand tall," she said, trying to catch his eyes, "she'll be watching today."  
“站直了，”她试图吸引他的目光，“她今天会看着你的。”

His brow bent. "I know."  
他的眉头紧皱。“我知道。”

They ventured out into the dusty plains. Winds howled across the scorched hills, lined with row upon row of perfectly spaced grave markers. Each rank and file was alphabetically ordered, and the walk to his mother's marker took thirty minutes.  
他们冒险进入尘土飞扬的平原。风在焦土覆盖的山丘上呼啸，一排排整齐划一的墓碑排列着。每一行每一列都按字母顺序排列，走到他母亲的墓碑前花了三十分钟。

The crunching of dirt alongside his own ceased, which made him turn. Misato had come to a halt just a few feet away. At his silent askance, she nodded him forward. He would have to go on alone.  
他身旁泥土的嘎吱声停止了，这让他转过头去。美里在几英尺外停了下来。面对他无声的询问，她点头示意他继续前行。他必须独自走下去。

Beyond, he spotted what could only be his father as a wavy, black pillar on the horizon. The man watched him through a pair of tinted glasses, a stone-gray VTOL gunship sitting in the space between graves. That seemed disrespectful somehow, even though he knew only a small percentage of them actually held bodies.  
远处，他看到了那只能是父亲的身影，如同一道波动的黑色柱子矗立在地平线上。男人透过一副有色眼镜注视着他，一架石灰色的 VTOL 武装直升机停放在墓碑之间的空地上。这似乎有些不敬，尽管他知道其中只有一小部分真正埋有遗体。

A tension pulled on his gut, pressed down on his shoulders and weighed in his feet. What should he say? What should he talk about? Would his father be happy to see him? Had Shinji been missed at all in the years he'd been away? These fears still stuck with him, inhabited his every thought, even when Asuka had been around to distract him.  
一股紧张感牵动着他的腹部，压在他的肩膀上，沉重地落在他的脚上。他该说什么？该谈些什么？父亲见到他会高兴吗？在他离开的这些年里，真嗣是否曾被怀念过？这些恐惧依然伴随着他，占据着他的每一个念头，即使有明日香在身边分散他的注意力。

It wasn't long before he was on the hill, standing in his father's shadow and peering up into those sunken, subdued orange-brown eyes. They were _sanpaku_ eyes: where one could see the white space beneath the irises, lending his stare a stark intensity. He was taller than the image in Shinji's memory, and the straight back and sharp edged shoulders of his dark uniform exuded a sense of authority. Even left unbuttoned as it was and lacking any formal rank insignia.  
不久后，他便站在了山丘上，置身于父亲的阴影中，抬头凝视着那双深陷、柔和的橙棕色眼睛。那是三白眼：可以看到虹膜下方的白色空间，使他的目光显得异常锐利。他比真嗣记忆中的形象更高大，笔直的背脊和深色制服上锋利的肩线散发出一种权威感。即便制服敞开着，没有佩戴任何正式的军衔徽章。

Something blossomed in Shinji then, embers spurred on by a thought half torn and abandoned.  
那时，某种情感在真嗣心中绽放，如同被半撕裂又抛弃的思绪点燃的余烬。

"Hello, father." “你好，父亲。”

"Shinji," the elder Ikari said, voice like gravel. That stare lingered but a moment longer and his father turned, facing the obsidian plaque that rose to his waist.  
“真嗣，”年长的碇开口道，声音沙哑如砾石。那目光停留了片刻，随后他的父亲转身，面对着那块升至腰间的黑曜石碑。

_Ikari Yui_. 碇唯。

Shinji saw his reflection looking down on the name. The date of birth and death rested under it, nothing else left to give credence to her existence. If it wasn't for this slab of glossy rock, Shinji wouldn't have believed she was ever real. His head dipped, running the math in his head.  
真嗣看着自己的倒影凝视着这个名字。出生与逝世的日期静静地列在下方，再无其他能证明她存在的痕迹。若非这块光滑的石碑，真嗣几乎要怀疑她是否真的存在过。他低下头，在心中默默计算着。

Twenty-seven. 二十七岁。

His mother had been twenty-seven when she died. Without being sure why, he took comfort in that insignificant number. It allowed an image of her to form. Countless times he'd tried to imagine her, with nothing but faded memories to build off of. He thought of someone like Misato, but with brown hair and blue eyes like his – a soft smile and waiting arms.  
他的母亲在她二十七岁时去世。尽管不确定为何，这个微不足道的数字却给了他一丝安慰。它让他得以构建出她的形象。无数次，他试图想象她的模样，仅凭着模糊的记忆作为基础。他想到了像美里那样的人，但有着与他一样的棕色头发和蓝色眼睛——温柔的微笑和等待的双臂。

"I still don't understand what happened to her," Shinji said, unsure of whether or not his father was merely an apparition, partially convinced he was just talking to himself amidst the gravestones. "Teacher told me... there was an accident in the lab you worked at."  
“我还是不明白她发生了什么，”真嗣说，不确定他的父亲是否只是一个幻影，部分相信自己只是在墓碑间自言自语。“老师告诉我……你在工作的实验室发生了事故。”

The screaming winds cut between them, making his father's unbuttoned jacket flap. "You thought that I had killed her," he said, never looking up from the black marker.  
呼啸的风在他们之间穿梭，使他父亲未扣的外套翻飞。“你以为是我杀了她，”他说，目光从未离开那支黑色马克笔。

Had he? Shinji couldn't remember. No one ever told him what she was doing or what had caused the accident. One day she was just gone.  
他真的知道吗？真嗣记不清了。没人告诉他她当时在做什么，或是事故的原因。有一天，她就突然消失了。

What was she like? Had she drank tea like Teacher? Or maybe she preferred coffee like the Langley's? Was she a decent cook? Would she have enjoyed the flowers in his garden? Or the sunlight skittering across the ponds? Did she have any boyfriends when she went to college? Where did she go to college? Would she have liked that he and Asuka were friends?  
她是什么样的人呢？她会像老师那样喝茶吗？或者像兰格利家的人一样喜欢咖啡？她厨艺好吗？她会喜欢他花园里的花吗？还是阳光在水面上跳跃的景象？她上大学时有男朋友吗？她去了哪所大学？她会喜欢他和明日香成为朋友吗？

"It doesn't feel like eight years," Shinji mumbled when it became clear his father had nothing more to say. They stood for a while longer, two feet apart, boring holes into a false tomb.  
“感觉不像已经八年了，”当确定父亲无话可说时，真嗣喃喃自语。他们又站了一会儿，相隔两步之遥，目光穿透了这座虚假的坟墓。

"Unit-01 is nearly complete," his father said, just when the echoing graveyard became too much to bear. "You will be leaving for Tokyo-3 in three weeks time."  
"初号机即将完成，" 就在墓地的回声变得难以忍受时，他的父亲说道，"你将在三周后前往第三新东京市。"

It was a sledgehammer to his lungs and for just a second – he really couldn't breathe.  
这消息如重锤击打在他的肺部，有那么一瞬间——他真的无法呼吸。

"Three weeks?" he asked, the question almost swept away in the wind.  
"三周？" 他问道，问题几乎被风卷走。

"As per the orders you were given five years ago."  
“按照五年前给你的命令。”

A fire gripped him. Surged up his spine and spider-webbed over his nerves in hot pulses. "I want to stay in Germany," he said.  
一股怒火攫住了他。热流沿着脊椎涌上，如蛛网般在他的神经上脉动。“我想留在德国，”他说。

From his father, there wasn't a pause or a glance. "That is irrelevant. You will do as ordered."  
他父亲没有丝毫停顿或瞥视。“那无关紧要。你必须服从命令。”

"Or what?" Shinji bit out through grit teeth, hands gripped tight enough to hurt. His father turned halfway, regarding him with stony, unwavering eyes. It wasn't that they were cold – if anything they made the burning in his chest all that more real. No, it was something else, something Shinji had learned to see in others without even realizing it. A look that was somehow divorced from reality – from feeling.  
"还是怎样？" 真嗣咬牙切齿地说道，双手紧握得生疼。他的父亲半转身，用坚硬、坚定不移的目光注视着他。并非这些目光冷漠——相反，它们让他的胸口燃烧得更加真实。不，这是别的东西，是真嗣在不知不觉中学会在他人身上辨识的东西。一种似乎与现实——与情感——脱节的目光。

"You will receive proper deployment papers in the next forty-eight hours," Gendo said, hesitating a moment longer, before taking his leave. The VTOL's turbines whined. Shinji watched it roar off, until it was just a little gray speck fading into blue on the horizon. Somewhere over the mountains was Tokyo-3, he'd seen it on the flight in. Over there was his Eva and the First Child.  
"你将在四十八小时内收到正式的部署文件，" 源堂说道，又犹豫了一会儿，然后离开了。垂直起降飞机的涡轮发出哀鸣。真嗣看着它咆哮着飞走，直到它变成天际线上一个渐渐消失的小灰点。在山的那一边是第三新东京市，他在飞来时见过。那边是他的 EVA 和第一适格者。

And he was being left behind again.  
而他又一次被留在了原地。

He wanted to scream. He wanted to cry. He was taken by a current and resisted the violent urges that rushed over his thoughts, if nothing else than because of the emptiness around him. The dead and their markers watched on, apathetic.  
他想尖叫，想哭泣。他被一股激流裹挟，抵抗着脑海中汹涌的暴力冲动，如果不是因为周围的空旷，他或许早已失控。那些死者及其墓碑冷漠地旁观着。

The walk back to Misato's parked rental took no time at all. Not with his mind whirling. He was thankful when she didn't press him, or really talk at all, even though he wanted to explode. He didn't want to talk.  
走回 Misato 停租车的地方几乎不费时间。他的思绪在飞速旋转。当她没有追问他，甚至几乎没说话时，他感到庆幸，尽管他内心渴望爆发。他不想交谈。

The flight back took twelve hours. They landed in Munich, where a NERV gunship took them up to the landing pads just outside the black pyramid in Berlin. Then he was home. By then, he had calmed some, even though it was taking all of his willpower to keep down the in-flight meals churning in his stomach.  
回程飞行耗时十二小时。他们在慕尼黑降落，NERV 的武装直升机将他们送往柏林黑色金字塔外的停机坪。然后他回到了家。那时，他已稍稍平静，尽管他竭尽全力才压制住胃中翻腾的飞机餐。

Through the trellised paths, he came to his small Japanese hut, dark with Teacher's absence. He must have been out buying groceries. Only silence greeted him in his room. Not even the wind chimes sang.  
穿过藤架小径，他来到了自己那间昏暗的日式小屋，因为老师不在而显得格外阴沉。老师一定是出去买菜了。房间里迎接他的只有寂静，连风铃都不曾吟唱。

Placed atop his desk was a letter and he quirked his head at that. No one but Ilka wrote him and he'd received and replied to a letter from her less than a week ago already. Picking it up, he discovered his name signed in Asuka's elegant cursive script – punctuated by a tiny heart. They hadn't talked in over a month now, and neither really had the time to even send texts. Well, he had time, but why bother sending a message that had a 50/50 chance of not getting a response? Shinji had gotten tired of that pretty quick.  
桌上放着一封信，他对此感到有些意外。除了伊尔卡，没人会给他写信，而他一周前才刚收到并回复了她的信。拿起信，他发现上面签着明日香优雅的草书——点缀着一颗小小的心。他们已经一个多月没联系了，而且双方都没时间发短信。好吧，他有时间，但何必发一条有 50%几率得不到回复的消息呢？真嗣很快就厌倦了这种等待。

After another moment's hesitation, Shinji tossed it in the nearby trash bin. His legs carried him only a few steps before it tugged at him and he stopped. Marching back, he snatched it out of the trash, a few new questionable stains marring it. He still didn't want to read it, and found a drawer to throw it in.  
犹豫片刻后，真嗣将信扔进了附近的垃圾桶。他的腿只带他走了几步，心中却感到一阵牵扯，于是停了下来。他大步走回，从垃圾桶里捡起信，信上多了几处可疑的污渍。他仍然不想读它，找到一个抽屉将它扔了进去。

Later that night, he settled amid that old, overgrown husk of a shed at the edge of the dandelion field. It had seemed so much larger when he was little – he almost felt too big for it now. The stars were dim that night, and Shinji lay there, rolling his father's words over and over in his mind. Familiar music played from the SDAT resting on his chest.  
那晚稍晚些时候，他蜷缩在蒲公英田边那座老旧、杂草丛生的废弃小屋里。这小屋在他小时候显得大得多——现在他几乎觉得太大了。那晚星星黯淡，真嗣躺在那里，一遍遍地在脑海中回旋着他父亲的那些话。熟悉的音乐从放在他胸口的 SDAT 播放器中传出。

Asuka called him something along the lines of 'shut-in hipster' whenever she caught him with it. A smirk tried to break free, but faltered. He remembered they used to sink their legs in the fountain by the roses, sharing the ear-buds. How she'd gently bounce her head side to side and mouth the words every time track 22 came on, her favorite. Mika Matsubara – _stay with me_.  
每当被她发现他在听音乐时，明日香总会称他为'宅男潮人'之类的。一丝微笑试图浮现，却未能坚持。他记得他们曾一起把腿浸在玫瑰花旁的喷泉里，共享着耳机。每当第 22 轨响起，她最喜欢的曲子，她就会轻轻地左右摇晃脑袋，嘴型随着歌词动。松原美香——与我同在。

The cassette clicked, switching to the next track. It was the same player his father had once held. Listened to on quiet nights. Picking it up, he examined it under the moonlight wondering – like he'd always done – why the man had ever given it to him. The answers he'd thought were real and true had been shattered.  
磁带咔嗒一声，切换到下一首曲目。这是他父亲曾经拥有的同款播放器。在宁静的夜晚聆听。他拿起它，在月光下仔细端详——就像他一直做的那样——想知道为什么那个男人会把它给他。他曾以为真实而正确的答案已经破碎。

Its frame creaked as Shinji squeezed, the black box resisting him, knowing he wasn't strong enough to break it.  
它的框架在真嗣的挤压下发出了吱嘎声，黑色盒子抗拒着他，知道他不够强壮无法将其破坏。

"I hate you_._" “我恨你。”

Friendship with Erika and Swina was strange.  
与艾丽卡和斯温娜的友谊颇为奇妙。

The former was playful and girlish in a way that he didn't understand at all, which was as exciting as it was perplexing. While the latter almost became a shadow, a companion at his shoulder everywhere he went – which didn't seem at all unnatural.  
前者带着一种他完全无法理解的俏皮和少女气息，既令人兴奋又让人困惑。而后者则几乎成了他的影子，无论他走到哪里，总有一个伙伴在肩旁相伴——这似乎一点也不显得不自然。

They met at the brick wall of Building A everyday. School was just a suggestion now, a worthless notion that one would smile politely at while disregarding everything that was said. They often went down the street to the convenience store, where Erika looked at him with those pretty eyes and smiled, wordlessly enticing euros from his pockets in exchange for the vanilla ice cream cones she loved so much. Swina mostly bought, and sometimes stole, smoked jerky. He taught Shinji how to spot the cameras and how to move so anyone looking in the mirrors couldn't tell you'd stolen anything. They usually left with their jacket pockets stuffed full.  
他们每天在 A 楼的砖墙边相遇。学校现在只是一个建议，一个无足轻重的概念，人们会礼貌地微笑着，却对所说的每一件事都置若罔闻。他们经常沿着街道去便利店，埃里卡用那双漂亮的眼睛看着他，微笑着，无声地从他的口袋里引诱出欧元，换取她钟爱的香草冰淇淋甜筒。斯温娜主要负责购买，有时也会偷些烟熏肉干。他教真嗣如何发现摄像头，以及如何移动，让任何在镜子里看的人无法察觉你偷了东西。他们通常离开时，夹克口袋都塞得满满的。

Shinji felt guilty every time, but tried not to think about it much.  
每次真嗣都感到内疚，但尽量不去多想。

The boy was also fond of American country music, and once shared an album from his ipod. Shinji didn't like it, but he didn't hate it either. Swina said he really wanted to be a singer, but his parents absolutely hated the idea. Wouldn't even let him get a guitar. His father wanted him to be a paralegal. The boy had his coarse, reddish brown hair grown out down to his shoulders, which he brushed back over his head whenever it got in his face.  
那男孩还喜欢美国乡村音乐，曾分享过一张从他 iPod 里的专辑。真嗣并不特别喜欢，但也不讨厌。斯温娜说他真的很想成为一名歌手，但他的父母对此深恶痛绝。甚至不让他买吉他。他父亲希望他成为一名律师助理。男孩留着一头粗糙的红棕色长发，垂至肩头，每当头发挡住视线时，他就会将其向后梳起。

Shinji could almost see him strumming a guitar in a smoke filled bar.  
真嗣几乎能想象他在烟雾缭绕的酒吧里弹奏吉他的样子。

Most weekends they'd take the S-bahn to the Tiergarten, right in the heart of the city. Autumn was beginning to sweep over northern Germany, sapping the life from the leaves and bleeding them gold. Carpets of red and yellow covered every walkway and created patchwork swells of color across the lakes. Chilling winds swept them up in whirlwinds while they walked, as though playful. Erika yelped when it threw her hair up and fought with her skirt. It made Shinji's hair a mess too, keeping it standing on end. Erika giggled and Swina bowled over laughing.  
大多数周末，他们会乘坐 S 线前往市中心的蒂尔加滕公园。秋天开始席卷德国北部，夺走了树叶的生命，将它们染成金色。红色和黄色的地毯覆盖了每条步行道，在湖面上形成了色彩斑斓的拼布。寒风在他们行走时卷起旋风，仿佛在嬉戏。埃丽卡在被风吹起头发和裙子时尖叫起来，而真嗣的头发也被吹得乱糟糟的，一直竖立着。埃丽卡咯咯笑着，斯温娜则笑得前仰后合。

Here they made trouble wherever they could find it, whether it was harassing the boat-people living on the Landwehr Canal, or hanging off the fencing by the Spree and chucking rocks at the tourist cruisers. At least until an officer or someone else hollered at them. Other times they'd find the monuments and statues scattered about and strike a pose while someone took a picture. Shinji hanging off Otto von Bismark's leg. Erika lounging on a lion. Swina sitting in Wagner's lap like it were a throne.  
他们在这里四处惹是生非，无论是骚扰住在兰德韦尔运河上的船民，还是挂在施普雷河边的栅栏上，向旅游巡航船扔石头。至少在警察或其他人大声呵斥他们之前是这样。其他时候，他们会找到散布在各处的纪念碑和雕像，摆出姿势让人拍照。真嗣挂在奥托·冯·俾斯麦的腿上。埃里卡躺在一只狮子身上。斯维娜坐在瓦格纳的腿上，仿佛那是一把王座。

When Erika wasn't around, and when they didn't seem to be competing to make her laugh, he and Swina crossed through the concrete coffins of the Murdered Jews Memorial, a pristine and ordered concrete barrier reef between them and Mitte. The stones rose and fell like waves, sometimes reaching high enough to consume them in their cold forest, the red of the setting sun creeping over the edges.  
当埃里卡不在身边，且他们似乎不再争相逗她笑时，他和斯维娜穿过被谋杀的犹太人纪念碑的混凝土棺材，这是一道整洁有序的混凝土屏障，将他们与米特区隔开。石块起伏如波浪，有时高得足以将他们吞没在冰冷的石林中，夕阳的余晖悄然爬过边缘。

From Mitte they crossed to the north of the Spree, where the police mustered in heavy-plated black riot gear. They came in armored trucks and bullet proof vans. Hot, stinking crowds of people had been gathering there to riot – and the two boys came to watch, unsure of what there was to protest. They took the opportunity to buy fishing string and found empty cans, tying them to the underside of cars. When the rioters got tired of rioting, Swina and Shinji hid nearby, watching the drivers begin to roll off – and freak out when the cans dropped from the bottom!  
从米特区，他们穿过施普雷河北岸，那里警察集结，身着厚重的黑色防暴装备。他们乘坐装甲卡车和防弹货车前来。炎热、臭气熏天的群众聚集在那里准备暴动——而这两个男孩前来观看，不确定有什么可抗议的。他们趁机购买了钓鱼线，并找到了空罐子，将它们绑在汽车底部。当暴徒们厌倦了暴动，斯维纳和真嗣躲在附近，看着司机们开始驶离——当罐子从车底掉落时，他们惊慌失措！

Other days they traveled along the Spree to the west, where it was covered for miles with graffiti. Tagged relentlessly by the youth gangs that littered the market places.  
其他日子里，他们沿着施普雷河向西旅行，那里数英里都被涂鸦覆盖。市场到处都是青少年帮派，他们不停地在墙上涂鸦。

"The West and the East are the same now," Swina hummed, dragging a stick along the stones. "That's what my da' said. Now everyone is poor."  
“现在西方和东方都一样，”斯维纳哼唱着，用一根棍子沿着石头划过。“我爸说的。现在大家都穷了。”

"Doesn't seem that way." Shinji said, a wind prompting him to shove his hands in his jacket. "How would he know everyone's poor?"  
"看起来不像那样。" 真嗣说道，一阵风吹来，他把手插进了夹克口袋。"他怎么知道大家都很穷？"

"He doesn't. My da' likes to think he knows everything. But I think the city used to look nicer than this."  
"他不知道。我爸总以为他什么都知道。但我觉得这座城市以前比现在好看。"

"Has there always been a difference?"  
"一直都有这样的差别吗？"

Swina shrugged. "Probably not."  
斯维娜耸了耸肩。"大概不会。"

His father had been born and raised in East Berlin. Said he was just fourteen when the wall had been knocked down. Swina said his family was pretty poor, but that his dad managed a power plant in Jänschwalde. Drove two hours every day there and back. No one at the Kloster really cared if you were from the west or east side of the city, but some just called Swina "Easterner" since he was one of a handful that could actually afford to attend.  
他的父亲出生并成长于东柏林。据说他才十四岁时，柏林墙就被推倒了。斯维娜说他的家庭相当贫困，但他父亲在扬斯瓦尔德管理着一家发电厂。每天往返需要开车两小时。在修道院里，没人真正在乎你是来自城市的西边还是东边，但有些人就因为斯维娜是少数能负担得起上学费用的人之一，就称他为"东边人"。

Erika never talked about home or her parents, which was fine with Swina, who always had something to complain about. They were both fine with that. Every now and then Shinji would find his inner smartass and rib Swina while he was in the middle of a story. Erika would slap his leg or push him and chide him. She made a habit of this, over the smallest of things – like how he ate his Chinese takeout, or when the heels of his shoes scraped the ground as he walked. He shrugged her off with a practiced ease developed over years of friendship with the Nag of All Nags, and egged her on. It was all just a game, and even though they didn't know the rules, at least they knew one another was playing.  
埃丽卡从不谈论她的家或父母，这对斯维娜来说无所谓，因为他总有抱怨的事情。他们对此都无所谓。偶尔，真嗣会找到他内心的机灵鬼，在斯维娜讲故事时调侃他。埃丽卡会拍他的腿或推他，责备他。她习惯于这样做，哪怕是最小的事情——比如他如何吃中餐外卖，或者当他走路时鞋跟刮擦地面。他以多年来与这位唠叨大王建立的友谊所培养出的从容态度，轻松地摆脱她的纠缠，并挑逗她继续。这一切都只是个游戏，尽管他们不知道规则，但至少知道对方都在参与。

Today they sat beneath shady trees, knees a few inches apart. Swina was off down the street, trying to convince the food vendor he was a homeless child and needed to feed his sister. They'd helped rip up and dirty his clothes some to make it convincing. Shinji and Erika waited between a pair of statues, the grass lime green and painted with swathes of amber. The one closest to Shinji had two dogs – their fur as thick as a wolf's – running under the whip of a man in old sixteenth century clothes. The kind with those funny triangle hats. He pointed down at Shinji.  
今天他们坐在树荫下，膝盖相隔几英寸。斯温娜跑到街对面，试图说服食品摊贩他是个无家可归的孩子，需要养活妹妹。他们帮忙撕破并弄脏了他的衣服，以增加可信度。真嗣和艾丽卡在一对雕像之间等待，草地呈现出鲜亮的绿色，点缀着片片琥珀色。离真嗣最近的雕像描绘了两个人，他们的毛发浓密如狼，在一位身着十六世纪旧式服装（那种戴着滑稽三角帽的款式）的男子鞭打下奔跑。他指向真嗣。

"I wonder why they only hunt foxes?" Erika asked. He followed her gaze to the other statue, depicting a man holding a dead fox up by the scruff of its neck, dogs nipping at its dangling feet.  
“我想知道为什么他们只猎狐狸？”艾丽卡问道。他顺着她的目光看向另一尊雕像，描绘了一个男子拎着一只死狐狸的颈背，狗儿们正咬着它悬空的双脚。

Shinji shrugged. "I don't know. I think it's because they're pretty smart, so they're harder to catch."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“我不知道。我觉得可能是因为狐狸很聪明，所以更难捕捉。”

"Hm, that sounds right," she said, pursing her flesh-pink lips. "I think my Uncle said they hunt bobcats in America."  
"嗯，听起来没错，" 她抿着粉嫩的嘴唇说道，"我记得叔叔说过，在美国他们猎捕山猫。"

"What's a bobcat?" "山猫是什么？"

"They're like lions, but smaller, and with spots."  
"它们像狮子，但体型较小，而且身上有斑点。"

He paused and looked up to the sky. "So wouldn't they be more like a cheetah?"  
他顿了顿，抬头望向天空。“那他们岂不是更像猎豹？”

"Whatever! You know what I mean!"  
“哎呀！你知道我意思的！”

"Well now I don't know if it looks more like a lion or a cheetah."  
“现在我真不知道它看起来更像狮子还是猎豹了。”

"Oh my gosh! It looks like both," she whined, but with a smile.  
"哦天哪！看起来两边都有，"她抱怨道，但脸上带着微笑。

They could hear the sounds of the city all around, muffled, as though coming from miles and miles away. The blare of a train's horn, the dull hum of traffic. Somewhere, a church bell tolled. The park was insular, sheltered in its own world like the garden back home.  
他们能听到四周城市的声音，低沉而遥远，仿佛来自数英里之外。火车的鸣笛声，车辆的低沉嗡鸣。某个地方，教堂的钟声响起。公园自成一体，像家中的花园一样，被自己的世界所庇护。

"So if you ever caught a fox, would you kill it?" Erika asked, taking the band from her ponytail. Blonde locks flowed around her neck.  
"那么如果你抓到一只狐狸，你会杀了它吗？" 艾丽卡问道，从马尾辫中取下发带。金色的发丝环绕在她的脖颈周围。

"Isn't that why people hunt stuff?"  
"那不就是人们猎奇的原因吗？"

"Yeah, but you don't have to."  
"是啊，但你不必如此。"

Shinji leaned back. "Probably not, then." he wasn't really thinking about it, finding it hard to keep his eyes from her face, or how soft her lips looked.  
真嗣向后靠了靠。“那可能不是吧。”他并没有真正在思考这个问题，只觉得难以将视线从她的脸上移开，或是她那看起来柔软的唇上。

"What if by killing it, you got a wish? Like, you don't have to do anything but shoot it, and you could have anything you ever wanted. Would you do it then?"  
"如果杀死它，你就能许一个愿呢？比如，你只需开枪，就能得到你想要的一切。那样的话，你会做吗？"

"How would killing a fox do that?" he asked, sitting straight. Hypotheticals were one of her favorite things, but he didn't have much patience for her what ifs.  
"杀一只狐狸怎么能实现愿望呢？" 他坐直了身子问道。假设性问题是她最喜欢的，但他对她的那些“如果”并没有太多耐心。

"It's a magic fox." "这是一只魔法狐狸。"

"Okay, but why?" “好吧，但为什么？”

"It just is. So would you? What would you wish for?" she asked. Those crystal blue eyes peered into him, searching.  
“就是这样。那你呢？你会许什么愿？”她问道。那双清澈的蓝眼睛凝视着他，探寻着。

He decided to look at the pond instead. "I don't know..."  
他决定转而看向池塘。“我不知道……”

Why would she ask him something like that? So adamantly too? The more he thought of it, sinking into the depths of the nature around them, the less he came up with to wish for. There were things he wanted, but when it really came down to it, he didn't know that he wished for anything. Maybe of never having to leave Germany. Maybe finally getting to pilot his Eva. Or... or having Asuka back at the garden. Part of him thought he'd like that, but with it came a surge of other thoughts and feelings. All like a knotted, black jumble of cords wrapping tight around him.  
她为何会那样坚决地问他那样的问题？他越是深思，沉浸在他们周围的自然之中，越是发现自己没有什么可愿望的。他确实有些想要的东西，但当真正面对时，他并不确定自己真的渴望什么。或许是永远不必离开德国。或许是终于能驾驶自己的 Eva。又或者……或者让明日香回到花园。他的一部分确实这么想过，但随之而来的是一股其他思绪和情感的涌动。所有这些都像一团纠结的黑线，紧紧缠绕着他。

He stopped thinking about her, made himself fret over school or the next sync test. Brooding. Still, maybe there was something else he wanted – really would give anything for again. The memory of his mother's grave marker came.  
他停止了对她的思索，让自己为学校或下一次同步测试而烦恼。忧郁。然而，也许还有其他他真正愿意为之付出一切的东西。他母亲的墓碑记忆浮现了。

Shinji found he liked dwelling on that even less.  
真嗣发现他甚至更不喜欢沉溺于那个记忆中。

Erika broke the silence, legs held up to her chest and ankles crossed. "If it meant I could be different, I think I'd kill the fox."  
埃丽卡打破了沉默，双腿蜷缩至胸前，脚踝交叉。“如果这意味着我能变得不同，我想我会杀了那只狐狸。”

That startled him, and he took a moment to stare at her, occupied by the twittering birds in the trees. She was always so happy – why would she want to change anything? He looked up too. The branches creaked, bright leaves shuffling. A softness crept over his hand, warm. He jerked, but didn't pull away when he saw her hand over his. There was an instant where he debated what to do next, where the bounding of his heart just about convinced his fight to take flight. His fingers folded with hers.  
这让他吃了一惊，他愣了一会儿，凝视着她，周围树上的鸟儿叽叽喳喳。她总是那么快乐——她为何想要改变什么呢？他也抬头望去。树枝吱嘎作响，明亮的叶子轻轻摇曳。一种柔软的感觉悄悄爬上他的手，温暖。他一惊，但看到她的手覆盖在他的手上时，并没有抽回。有那么一瞬间，他在犹豫下一步该做什么，心跳如鼓，几乎让他想要逃离。他的手指与她的交缠在一起。

"My dad used to hunt," she said, facing away from him. The tips of her ears were red, like they always got whenever he was close to her. "Not foxes... it was, deer, I think... or, um–"  
“我爸爸以前打猎，”她背对着他说道。她的耳尖泛红，每当他靠近时总是如此。“不是狐狸……是鹿，我想……或者，嗯——”

Thoughts like sparks flared in his mind, fixated on her hand with his. Shinji found himself closer to her, only a breath away. She looked his way again and he froze as her eyes studied him. Her lips nearly brushed his – and she turned, utterly crimson. A punch of anger and embarrassment crashed through him.  
思绪如火花般在他脑海中迸发，他的手紧握着她的。真嗣发现自己离她更近了，仅隔着一息之遥。她再次看向他，他的目光与她相遇，他僵住了。她的唇几乎擦过他的——然后她转过身，满脸通红。一股愤怒和尴尬的冲击波席卷了他。

For an awful few seconds, every impulse in him screamed to leave and escape his humiliation. For a second, he even hated her. But he continued to lean in anyway, just as she whirled back to plant her lips on his. Except their teeth ended up knocking together. They bumped off one another, each with a hand up to their mouth. Then they tried again, slower this time. Made just as awkward as they both tried to figure out which side to put their head on. He screwed his eyes shut as their lips closed – realizing he didn't actually know what to do. She must've kissed before, because she moved her mouth a little, even when all he really did was press his lips harder to hers. It was wet, more than he'd ever imagined. A bit of spittle still clung between them when they decided they'd done it long enough. He supposed it was nice – why did adults do that so much?  
有那么可怕的几秒钟，他内心的一切冲动都在尖叫着逃离这羞辱。有那么一刻，他甚至恨她。但他还是继续靠近，就在她转回身来吻上他的唇时。结果他们的牙齿撞在了一起。他们各自捂着嘴退开，然后又试了一次，这次慢了一些。同样笨拙，因为他们都在试图弄清楚该把头偏向哪一边。当他们的唇即将相触时，他闭上了眼睛——意识到自己其实并不知道该怎么做。她以前一定接过吻，因为她微微动了动嘴唇，尽管他只是更用力地压向她的唇。这比他想象的还要湿润。当他们决定已经吻得够久时，一丝唾液仍粘连在他们之间。他想这感觉还不错——为什么大人们那么喜欢这样做呢？

She wiped a sleeve across her face, cheeks red enough to burn, while he rubbed a back hand over his mouth. For a while, neither could meet the other's eyes.  
她用袖子抹了把脸，双颊红得发烫，而他则用背手擦了擦嘴。一时间，两人都不敢直视对方。

Soon, Swina came back, a powder-loaded funnel cake in his hands. He greeted them with a big grin, boasting his silver-tongued talents in a rush of detail. Shinji noticed his hands were shaking as he passed them the plate.  
不久，斯维娜回来了，手里拿着一个装满粉末的漏斗蛋糕。他带着灿烂的笑容向他们打招呼，急切地炫耀着自己口若悬河的本领。真嗣注意到他在递给他们盘子时，手在微微颤抖。

---

Two weeks left. 还剩两周。

Shinji had since received the orders his father promised. Just the sight of the NERV stamp had his breakfast ready to tumble all over the floor.  
自从接到父亲承诺的命令后，光是看到 NERV 的印章，就让真嗣的早餐几乎要全吐在地板上。

Two weeks. 两周了。

And he still hadn't told Erika. He was just delaying the inevitable, he knew, which was becoming harder and harder to face in his mind. Especially after they'd held hands and kissed. He didn't know why, but the memory burned him. Had him angry over nothing and for no good reason. She'd been calling and texting him too, but he felt less and less like answering as his confusion grew and compounded into frustration.  
而他仍然没有告诉艾丽卡。他知道这只是拖延不可避免的结局，这在他心中变得越来越难以面对。尤其是在他们牵手和亲吻之后。他不知道为什么，但这段记忆让他感到痛苦。让他无端愤怒，没有任何合理的理由。她也一直在给他打电话和发短信，但随着他的困惑逐渐累积成挫败感，他越来越不想回应。

He liked her, or he thought he did. They'd kissed, after all. On their brief train ride home that night, she'd sat close enough for their thighs to touch, and even fell asleep on his shoulder. Swina sat away and pretended to be asleep. Shinji knew because he always snored whenever he fell asleep.  
他喜欢她，或者说他以为自己有这种感觉。毕竟，他们接过吻。那天晚上短暂的回家火车上，她坐得近到两人的大腿相触，甚至靠在他肩上睡着了。斯温娜坐在一旁，假装睡着。真嗣知道，因为他每次睡着都会打呼噜。

Still, as many times as Shinji wished he could take it back, and mentally bludgeoned himself a dozen times a day, Erika seemed to like him too. He thought about kissing her again, wondering if it would feel different a second time. He'd probably done it all wrong.  
尽管真嗣无数次希望自己能收回那份感情，每天在心里痛打自己十几遍，但似乎艾丽卡也对他有好感。他想着再次吻她，想知道第二次的感觉是否会不同。他可能第一次完全做错了。

Shinji groaned, wishing he hadn't left his SDAT back home. He hated thinking about it so much, and he didn't want to with Asuka in town. It should've been a good distraction, but it wasn't – every muscle in his chest was wound tight to snapping.  
真嗣叹了口气，真希望自己没把 SDAT 留在家。他讨厌这么频繁地想起这件事，尤其是在明日香来城里的时候。这本该是个不错的分散注意力的方式，但并没有——他胸口的每一块肌肉都紧绷得快要断裂。

Today was German Unity Day and Asuka had come back home for an extended stay. Currently, he was waiting in the car, his imagination torturing him every minute of the ride with possibilities of an angry or hurtful confrontation, riddled with a festering guilt.  
今天是德国统一日，明日香回家来住了好一阵子。此刻，他正坐在车里，一路上每分每秒都被自己的想象折磨着，满脑子都是可能发生的愤怒或伤害性的对峙，心中愧疚如溃烂般蔓延。

It was well into the afternoon by the time they went, rolling into the thriving vibrancy of Berlin. Even Teacher was going, claiming it was for the sake of being cordial. They'd gathered in the foyer of the house, waiting for Ilka and Mila to come down stairs. Shinji had protested going, even considered feigning sickness. Well, he started by saying he wasn't feeling well, wishing Mila were there instead of Langley. That way she might have taken pity on him and convinced the man to let him stay, that Asuka probably wouldn't mind.  
他们出发时已近下午，驶入了柏林的繁华活力之中。甚至连老师也一同前往，声称是为了保持礼貌。他们在屋子的门厅集合，等待伊尔卡和米拉下楼。真嗣抗议过要去，甚至考虑过装病。嗯，他一开始就说自己感觉不舒服，希望米拉在场而不是兰格利。那样的话，她可能会同情他，说服那人让他留下，而明日香大概也不会介意。

But she wasn't, and Langley nodded, mulling over a thoughtful grimace. "You know, if a soldier at Hohenfels is caught lying to avoid drills – we make him sweep the sunshine off the sidewalks." he paused and a smirk spread across his face. "Takes them all day."  
但她不在，兰格利点头沉思，脸上露出严肃的表情。“你知道，如果霍恩费尔斯的一个士兵为了逃避训练而撒谎——我们会让他把人行道上的阳光扫干净。”他顿了顿，脸上露出一丝得意的笑容。“得花上一整天。”

It took Shinji a second to get it, and a deep laugh rolled from Langley when it clicked. He must've been in a good mood. Shinji had only seen him openly laugh maybe one or two times before. The man soon became serious again, fixing the tie of his suit. "Even if you are sick, Asuka insisted that we bring you. Seems you're out of luck."  
真嗣花了片刻才反应过来，当一切明了时，兰利发出了一阵深沉的笑声。他一定是心情不错。真嗣之前只见过他公开大笑一两次。男人很快又恢复了严肃，整理着自己的西装领带。“即便你生病了，明日香坚持要我们带你来。看来你运气不佳。”

He really was. If it was something Asuka wanted, then there definitely wasn't any getting out of it. The world faded to a painted blur, his brain on auto-pilot, trying to decipher why Asuka couldn't have informed him of that herself. He hadn't seen her once since she'd arrived earlier that morning.  
他确实如此。如果是明日香想要的，那肯定无法逃避。世界变得模糊不清，他的大脑自动运转，试图解析为何明日香不能亲自告诉他这一点。自从她今早到达后，他一次也没见过她。

His phone buzzed and he peered at the screen. A message from Erika.  
他的手机震动了一下，他瞥了一眼屏幕。是艾丽卡发来的消息。

_I don't know why you won't answer, but me and Swina are going to the Gate tonight. If you want to see me.  
我不知道你为何不回应，但我和斯维娜今晚要去大门那里。如果你想见我。_

His fingers hovered over the screen, but what was he supposed to say? There was too much to explain, too much he didn't want to talk about. Erika had texted him a few times to see if he was going, but he hadn't answered, knowing he was probably hurting her feelings. He could feel the desperation behind it. The worry.  
他的手指悬停在屏幕上，但他该说什么呢？有太多需要解释，太多他不想提及的事。埃丽卡几次发消息问他是否去，他都没回复，知道这可能伤了她的心。他能感受到背后的绝望和担忧。

Was he a bad person?  
他是个坏人吗？

What should he do? 他该怎么办？

They found parking in a garage by the Landwehr and they had to walk a ways up to the Postdamer Platz road. It was hard on grandma Ilka's legs, so Shinji let her hold onto his arm as they walked.  
他们在兰德维尔运河附近的一个车库找到了停车位，然后不得不步行一段路到波茨坦广场。这对伊尔卡奶奶的腿来说很吃力，所以真嗣让她挽着自己的胳膊走。

The festival had been going on for three days and tonight was the last night. Police were out in force, practically lining the main road to the Brandenburg Gate. They'd marked out where the wall had once been, and the place was frothing with a blurring mass of color and voices. Black, red and yellow bars sailed over a sea of heads, hundreds of flags billowing and swaying with the waves.  
这个节日已经持续了三天，今晚是最后一晚。警察大批出动，几乎沿着通往勃兰登堡门的主路排成一列。他们标出了曾经柏林墙的位置，这个地方充斥着色彩斑斓、人声鼎沸的景象。黑、红、黄三色的条带在人头攒动的海洋上空飘扬，数百面旗帜随风飘动，摇曳生姿。

All down the Bundesstrasse road were carnival rides and food tents, catering far too many dishes to smell all at once. Sweet swirling toffee and caramels from powdered cookies and jelly filled cakes, their compounds glowing honey and gold. They mingled pleasantly with the flowery sweet and spice rich scents of charred meats and fresh soups, wafting over from pavilions with massive hanging grills hooked to the middle. Which were packed with every kind of sausage, steak and hamburger known to man.  
沿着联邦大街一路都是嘉年华的游乐设施和食品帐篷，供应着太多一次性无法闻遍的美食。甜美的旋转太妃糖和焦糖从粉状饼干和果冻填充的蛋糕中散发出来，它们的化合物闪耀着蜂蜜和金色。这些香气与烤肉和新鲜汤品的花香甜味及香料浓郁气息愉快地交融，从悬挂着巨大烤架的亭子中飘来，烤架上摆满了各种已知的人类香肠、牛排和汉堡。

Langley was in dress uniform tonight – what he wore to all formal occasions. Blue trousers and dark coat, topped with a black beret. Commendations sat proudly on his left breast, a cobalt tassel wrapping under his right arm. The uniform itself seemed a bit worn for wear: color faded and with a few stitches out of place at the sleeves and underneath the golden buttons. Shinji briefly wondered if he'd ever thought of getting a new one.  
兰利今晚身着礼服——他参加所有正式场合的着装。蓝色裤子和深色外套，头戴黑色贝雷帽。勋章自豪地别在他的左胸，一缕钴蓝色的流苏绕过他的右臂。这套制服看起来有些磨损：颜色褪去，袖子和金色纽扣下有些线头松脱。真嗣短暂地想了一下，他是否曾考虑过换一套新的。

He soon lost sight of the man and Mila as they stopped to talk with other men that must've been with his unit – garbed in the dress grays of German soldiers. That left him with an estranged aunt and uncle, and their college attending children. None of them were as young as Asuka.  
他很快便看不见那个男人和米拉了，因为他们停下来与其他穿着德国士兵灰色制服的人交谈，那一定是他所在部队的同伴。这让他只剩下一位疏远的姑姑和姑父，以及他们正在上大学的孩子。他们中没有一个像明日香那么年轻。

Shinji had yet to see her, but didn't want to ask anyone if they'd be meeting up somewhere. The more they walked, the more of their entourage that fell away. Lost in the crowds.  
真嗣还没见到她，但不想问任何人他们是否会在某个地方见面。他们走得越远，随行的人就越少。消失在人群中。

There were actual snowfalls of confetti as the night went on. He could see the pipes shooting out an endless stream of them. Ilka bought him bits of pretzels striped with caramel. By then it was just the two of them and Teacher. The night had come on in full and people occupied every stretch of road.  
随着夜晚的深入，真的有像雪花般的五彩纸屑飘落。他能看到管道喷射出源源不断的纸屑。伊尔卡给他买了些涂着焦糖的椒盐卷饼。那时只剩下他们俩和老师。夜幕完全降临，人们占据了每一段街道。

They were close to the Gate, glowing orbs marking where the wall had stood in a wide ring around it, once claimed like a trophy by the Eastern conquerors. Teacher watched, unphased by the excitement, and Ilka had tears coming to the corners of her eyes, though wouldn't share whatever sweet memory she was reliving. Shinji found himself searching for Asuka, even though there was no way he could possibly spot her among so many people. But he did.  
他们靠近了那座门，发光的球体标记着曾经环绕其周围的墙壁位置，那宽阔的圆环一度被东方征服者视为战利品。导师在一旁观看，不为兴奋所动，而伊尔卡的眼角泛起了泪花，尽管她不愿分享正在重温的甜蜜记忆。真嗣发现自己不由自主地寻找着明日香，尽管在如此多的人群中不可能找到她。但他确实找到了。

She was standing by the border, next to her dad and step-mom, except there was a good three feet separating them. She watched the fireworks burst over the gate, pensive. Splashes of red and blue painted her face. The thought to call out to her crossed his mind, but she wouldn't have heard him. Not with tens of thousands singing the national anthem in one echoing voice.  
她站在边界旁，旁边是她的父亲和继母，只是他们之间隔了足足三英尺。她凝视着门上空绽放的烟花，若有所思。红色和蓝色的光斑在她脸上跳跃。他脑海中闪过呼唤她的念头，但她不可能听到他的声音。毕竟，数万人正齐声高唱国歌，那回荡的声音震耳欲聋。

"Flourish in the radiance of this happiness!"  
“在这幸福的辉光中绽放吧！”

"Flourish, German fatherland!"  
"繁荣吧，德意志祖国！"

Shinji got up earlier than usual for school.  
真嗣比平时更早起床去上学。

Asuka would be sleeping in until ten at least, and he'd be well into some boring lesson at the Kloster, or outside the chapel with Swina. Today turned out to be the latter. His friend had been acting weird, which was a smaller part of the reason Shinji had been less inclined to hang out the past few days, due in no small part to Swina's absence at the canals. Or how he'd stopped taking to following Shinji around, talking up whatever new tricks he wanted to try on the poor, unsuspecting citizens in the city. Whatever it was, Shinji hoped he was over it.  
明日香至少会睡到十点，而他已经在修道院的某个无聊课堂上，或者和斯维娜在教堂外。今天碰巧是后者。他的朋友行为古怪，虽然这只是真嗣最近几天不太愿意出去玩的较小原因之一，很大程度上也归咎于斯维娜不在运河边。或者他不再像以前那样跟着真嗣，谈论他想在城里那些毫无戒心的市民身上尝试的新把戏。不管是什么原因，真嗣希望他已经克服了。

They met by the big oak outside the chapel. Erika was stuck in English class and Swina watched him as he approached. "Where have you been?"  
他们在教堂外的大橡树下相遇。埃丽卡被困在英语课上，斯温娜看着他走近。“你去哪儿了？”

He shrugged. "Busy." 他耸耸肩。“忙。”

Swina shrugged back, stuffing his hands in his pockets as he turned and started walking. "Erika was just wondering. She's always bringing you up now."  
斯温娜也耸了耸肩，双手插进口袋，转身开始走。“埃丽卡只是好奇。她现在总是提起你。”

Shinji just grunted, eager to change the subject. "So what's this about Luitpold?" he asked, referencing their chapel priest. Swina mentioned by text they should try and sneak inside, but hadn't elaborated on how.  
"真嗣只是咕哝了一声，急切地想换个话题。“那么，这个关于利特普洛德的事情是怎么回事？”他问道，指的是他们的教堂牧师。斯维娜通过短信提到他们应该尝试潜入内部，但没有详细说明如何做到。”

Time ticked by and Swina didn't respond. Then he came to a stop, regarding Shinji as one might a ghost. "Why did you kiss her?"  
"时间一分一秒地过去，斯维娜没有回应。然后他停了下来，像看待一个幽灵一样看着真嗣。“你为什么要吻她？””

Shinji glared at him, cheeks boiled red. "You saw?"  
"真嗣瞪着他，脸颊涨得通红。“你看到了？””

Swina made something of a grimace, then another shrug.  
斯温娜做了个苦脸，然后又耸了耸肩。

Shinji chewed on the inside of his cheek. Could Swina had liked Erika too? He had sort of suspected it, but had never considered the idea in a thoughtful manner. It was always on the periphery. Undertones to how they spoke and how they acted when Erika was between them.  
真嗣咬着脸颊内侧。斯温娜也喜欢埃丽卡吗？他有点怀疑，但从未认真考虑过这个想法。它总是在边缘徘徊，是他们谈话和埃丽卡在他们之间时的潜台词。

"I dunno... I just did," he said, not willing to even tug at the tangled thread that was his feelings for her.  
“我不知道……我就是这么觉得，”他说，不愿去触碰那团乱麻般的对她的感情。

A shadow of resentment fell over Swina, but he nodded. "Someone's been leaving the back door to the chapel open. I think it's Sister Maria. She always forgets stuff like that. We're going to see if she left it today."  
一丝怨恨的阴影掠过斯维娜的脸庞，但他点了点头。“有人一直忘记关教堂的后门。我觉得是玛丽亚修女。她总是忘记这类事情。我们要去看看她今天是不是又忘了。”

As much as Shinji liked the chapel sisters, the idea of being somewhere he wasn't supposed to be, and doing what he wanted – was exciting.  
尽管真嗣喜欢教堂的修女们，但想到去一个不该去的地方，做自己想做的事——这让他感到兴奋。

The courtyards leading up to the chapel were tightly packed, surrounded on all sides as they were by other buildings of the Kloster's large campus. It widened to an open field as they went out back, where Shinji had earned his fair share of cuts and bruises on the playgrounds.  
通往教堂的庭院紧密相连，四周被修道院庞大的校园内其他建筑所包围。当他们走到后院时，庭院扩展成了一片开阔的场地，真嗣在这里的游乐场上留下了不少伤痕和瘀青。

"Are you sure no one's going to see us?" Shinji asked, glancing over his shoulder.  
“你确定没人会看到我们吗？” 真嗣问道，回头看了一眼。

Swina was still ahead. "Everyone is busy with classes right now and the sisters have gone home. No one will see us."  
斯温娜还在前面。“现在大家都在上课，姐妹们也回家了。没人会看到我们的。”

Shinji's eyes squinched. Swina didn't talk like that. Maybe he shouldn't have come at all if his friend was going to act so weird. Caught up in his thoughts, Shinji didn't really notice as they came around the back of the church, where this side of the school's bike rack was set up. Wide enough on all sides to fit far more than it needed. Most of the racks were empty. But it led right up to the back door of the chapel. If he remembered right, it would lead them to the hallway just behind the altar.  
真嗣的眼睛眯了起来。斯温娜不会那样说话。也许他根本就不该来，如果他的朋友表现得这么奇怪。沉浸在自己的思绪中，真嗣并没有注意到他们已经绕到了教堂的后面，那里是学校自行车架的另一侧。四周足够宽敞，可以容纳远超所需的自行车。大部分车架都是空的。但这直接通向教堂的后门。如果他没记错的话，那会带他们到祭坛后面的走廊。

The only problem was that there was already another boy sitting on the steps. Shinji was about to tell Swina they should go and try again, when he took a good look at who it was.  
唯一的问题是，台阶上已经坐了另一个男孩。真嗣正要告诉斯维娜他们应该离开再试一次，这时他仔细看了看那人是谁。

Günter stood as they stopped amidst the rows of metal racks, shaking his head to clear the hair from his face. Shinji glared, heart racing, and was about to turn – when chainlinks crashed together, a pair of the usual goons having just closed the fence leading out, now standing guard before it. On his left, two more rose from behind a row of bikes, faces stony, by eyes amused.  
当他们停在金属货架之间时，君特站起身来，摇了摇头，把头发从脸上甩开。真嗣瞪大了眼睛，心跳加速，正要转身——这时铁链哗啦一声，一对常见的打手刚刚关闭了通往外面的围栏，现在正站在那里守卫。在他左边，又有两人从一排自行车后面站起来，面无表情，但眼神中带着戏谑。

"Thanks Scharnhorst," Günter said, coming down the steps and taking his hands out of his pockets. Swina didn't say anything as he clapped him on the shoulder.  
“谢谢你，沙恩霍斯特。”君特走下台阶，把手从口袋里拿出来。斯维娜没有说话，只是拍了拍他的肩膀。

Shinji's lungs were practically in his throat, fear lancing through every nerve. Weissenburg had taught him how to control that, how to tune it out. But he couldn't manage. He'd never had to test all those lessons before, and Günter never fought unless the odds were in his favor. Five to one was never a winning scenario for anyone, except maybe Alexander the Great. But Shinji didn't have a few thousand pikemen at his back. All he could do was stare at Swina, trying to find some explanation, some hint of what he had done so wrong to deserve this.  
真嗣的肺几乎要跳到喉咙口，恐惧如利箭般穿透每一根神经。魏森堡曾教他如何控制这种情绪，如何将其屏蔽。但他做不到。他从未真正考验过那些课程，而金特从不打无把握之仗。五对一从来不是任何人的胜算，或许除了亚历山大大帝。但真嗣身后没有数千名长枪兵。他只能盯着斯维娜，试图找到某种解释，某种线索，明白自己究竟做错了什么，以至于落得如此下场。

"I thought we were friends, Swina," he said. The boy flinched and looked away. He'd already chosen his friends.  
“我以为我们是朋友，斯维娜。”他说道。男孩畏缩了一下，转过头去。他已经选择了他的朋友。

"He's not friends with a _Japse_." Günter said, "nobody's your friend here."  
“他不会和日本人做朋友。”金特说，“这里没人是你的朋友。”

Shinji knew he was wrong, but the words hit him harder than any stone or fist. Caged up and surrounded by enemies. One of whom he'd trusted. That was always the issue, wasn't it? How did he always let this happen? With Günter, it was different. They'd been scraping ever since he was seven, and Shinji had given up a long time ago trying to understand why the other boy hated him so much. He'd never wanted to come to Germany and attend its schools or learn its language. Other people had made him do that. They made him fight and told him he was supposed to save the world from something.  
真嗣知道自己错了，但这些话比任何石头或拳头都更让他心痛。被困住，被敌人包围。其中有一个他曾信任的人。这总是问题的所在，不是吗？他为何总是让这种情况发生？对于君特，情况不同。自从他七岁起，他们就一直互相争斗，而真嗣早已放弃试图理解为什么那个男孩如此恨他。他从没想过要来德国，上这里的学校或学习这里的语言。是别人逼他这么做的。他们逼他战斗，告诉他应该拯救世界免受某种威胁。

He never wanted any of that.  
他从没想要过这些。

Shinji's defeat must've shown, because Günter smirked and stepped in to deliver a punch. Shinji moved on reflex, but too late. Günter's knuckles slammed his lower lip into his teeth – drawing blood. Staggering, Shinji still managed to catch his wrist. Dismay flashed over the other boy's expression, just for a moment. It threw him off balance enough for Shinji to pull him into his outstretched elbow, face first. Flesh crunched and the two of them fumbled steps as Shinji twisted him around, bending his arm up against his back. Günter had time to shout before Shinji, stumbling, pitched him down at the bar of a bike rack. The metal reverberated with the impact of his head and Günter was on the ground, dazed.  
真嗣的败势显然显露无疑，因为君特冷笑一声，上前挥拳。真嗣本能地闪避，但为时已晚。君特的指节猛击他的下唇，撞上了牙齿——鲜血直流。踉跄中，真嗣仍设法抓住了他的手腕。对方的表情瞬间闪过一丝惊慌。这让他失去了平衡，真嗣趁机用伸出的肘部迎面撞击，两人脚步踉跄。真嗣扭转身子，将他的手臂反折到背后。君特还没来得及喊出声，真嗣一个趔趄，将他摔向自行车架的横杆。金属因撞击而震动，君特倒地，神志不清。

A rush of movement came from behind. Shinji half turned, bending his knees and drawing his arm in. He rammed an elbow into the gut of another boy as he stepped into the charge. His attacker doubled over, but kept his footing, and Shinji struggled shoving him away.  
身后一阵急促的脚步声。真嗣半转身，屈膝收臂。他迎面撞上另一个男孩的腹部，用肘部猛击。对方弯腰，但稳住了脚步，真嗣费力地将他推开。

He couldn't feel anything after that, adrenaline pulsing hard. It was like his mind went blank – total darkness. His body didn't belong to him, driven by a melting heat that phased out every real and rational thought. Possessed.  
自那之后，他什么也感觉不到了，肾上腺素剧烈涌动。仿佛他的思维一片空白——彻底的黑暗。他的身体不再属于他，被一股融化的热力驱使，抹去了所有真实和理性的念头。被附身了。

Shinji took two long strides and lunged for Günter, turning him over and straddling his chest. The boy threw desperate, sloppy punches, teeth grit. Shinji slammed his fist down on Günter's nose, making him scream. The second sank into his cheek – impact shuddering through his arm. It felt good, and Shinji found that he couldn't stop. Didn't _want_ to stop. Hammering down again and again and again – each blow more vicious than the last. Each more feral and desperate and wild for blood.  
真嗣迈出两大步，猛扑向君特，将他翻转过来并骑在他胸口。男孩绝望地挥出凌乱的拳头，紧咬牙关。真嗣一拳砸在君特的鼻子上，让他尖叫起来。第二拳击中他的脸颊——冲击力震颤着他的手臂。这种感觉很好，真嗣发现自己停不下来。不想停下来。一拳又一拳，一次比一次更凶狠。每一次都更加野蛮、绝望，渴望鲜血。

Distantly, Shinji knew he was pounding his knuckles raw–  
真嗣隐约知道自己的拳头在被打得血肉模糊——

A wet crunch snapped the air.  
一阵湿漉漉的碎裂声划破了空气。

Shinji stopped. 真嗣停了下来。

Hot, sticky blood dripped from his fingers, arm half raised for another hit. It spattered on Günter's neck and chin, streaks of red rolling down his neck. Shinji's breath came out in ragged gasps, and a sickness swelled in his stomach. Günter's left cheek didn't look right, pushing up into his eye, which was hidden by split and hemorrhaging tissue. His flesh was bulbous and black in places, lips puffy, nose crooked.  
滚烫粘稠的血液从他的指尖滴落，手臂半举着准备再次出击。血滴溅在君特的脖颈和下巴上，一道道红色痕迹顺着他的脖子流下。真嗣的呼吸急促而断续，一阵恶心感在他胃里翻涌。君特的左脸看起来不对劲，向上推挤着他的眼睛，被撕裂和出血的组织遮住了。他的皮肤有些地方肿胀发黑，嘴唇肿胀，鼻子歪斜。

For a terrible, gut ripping moment, Günter didn't move.  
有那么一瞬间，冈特僵立不动，仿佛内脏都被撕裂。

A cough jerked his chest. Then another, and he whimpered, head rolling to the side. Shinji blinked, and realized he couldn't see out of his left eye, blood seeping from a ripping gash he didn't remember receiving. On his right, a gangly boy stood with a wooden pole in his hand, only half raised in a lax grip.  
一阵咳嗽猛地扯动他的胸腔。接着又是一阵，他呜咽着，头偏向一侧。真嗣眨了眨眼，意识到自己左眼看不见了，鲜血从一道他不记得何时受的撕裂伤中渗出。在他右边，一个瘦长的男孩手里拿着一根木棍，半举着，松松地握着。

At some point, he must have managed a grazing hit, failing a second attempt when he realized the blow hadn't deterred Shinji in the slightest. Weissenburg had told him people could do things, unbelievable things, when they had enough adrenaline moving through them. Could even ignore pain from crippling wounds. It was lucky he hadn't been hit in the temple or back, otherwise he'd have been out cold.  
不知何时，他一定曾设法擦伤了真嗣，但在第二次尝试时失败了，因为他意识到这一击丝毫没有让真嗣退缩。魏森堡曾告诉他，当人们体内有足够的肾上腺素时，他们能做到一些不可思议的事情，甚至可以忽视来自致命伤口的疼痛。幸运的是，他没被打中太阳穴或背部，否则他早就昏过去了。

Everyone was frozen in place, horror stricken from the sheer tenacity and hate behind his violence. They didn't even think of taking a step, or uttering a word, until Shinji crawled off of Günter, still panting. Feeling all of the fatigue and hurt roll into him. He probably had a concussion. The boys rushed to Günter, all shouting in a panic. One of them fumbled for their phone, another hesitating with his hands over Günter's face, utterly helpless. The gangly one dropped the pole and ran off around the corner, calling for help.  
每个人都僵在原地，被他暴力背后那股顽强的仇恨所震惊。他们甚至没有想到要迈出一步，或说出一个字，直到真嗣从京特身上爬下来，仍然喘着气。所有的疲惫和伤痛都涌向他。他可能脑震荡了。男孩们冲向京特，全都惊慌失措地大喊。其中一个手忙脚乱地找手机，另一个犹豫不决地把手放在京特的脸上，完全无助。那个瘦长的家伙丢下棍子，跑到拐角处呼救。

Feet shuffled to him, Swina's hands latching tentatively around one of Shinji's arms. His head burned and he launched himself up, shoving Swina hard. "_Get away from me_," he snarled, staggering back from weak legs. The fear in Scharnhorst's wide-eyes stung him.  
脚步向他移动，斯维娜的手试探性地抓住真嗣的一只胳膊。他的头在燃烧，他猛地站起来，用力推开斯维娜。“离我远点，”他咆哮着，踉跄地后退，双腿无力。沙恩霍斯特睁大的眼睛里的恐惧刺痛了他。

Two of Günter's friends tried helping him to his feet, a third boy of brown hair and green eyes, unable to lend a hand, stared at Shinji, looking lost. "What did you do?" he asked, not understanding the question himself.  
京特的两个朋友试图扶他站起来，第三个棕色头发、绿色眼睛的男孩无法帮忙，茫然地看着真嗣。“你做了什么？”他问，自己也不明白这个问题。

Shinji slowly, steadily, got up and walked out of the bike cage. Bleeding fist tucked against his stomach, he leaned on the wall at the corner of the chapel for support. But didn't make it very far before pitching forward and throwing up.  
真嗣缓缓地、稳稳地站起身，走出了自行车棚。流血的拳头紧贴着肚子，他靠在教堂拐角的墙上支撑着。但没走多远就向前一倾，吐了出来。

---

Herr Langley arrived an hour later to pick him up. Shinji's head had been bandaged by a disturbed looking Sister Maria, her movements hesitating and her sentences short and halting, as though he were more like a delicate explosive than a bloodied boy. She gave him pain relievers for the headache. Then he was sat outside the Headmistress' office, a police officer at his side. The man seemed uneasy over the whole affair, calming some when he and Langley spoke off to the side. He was in his olive green service uniform, shined shoes soon clapping to a halt next to Shinji's chair. He couldn't tell if the man was angry, annoyed or disappointed. Langley only waited for him to rise, then led him out without a word. Shinji drew stares from the other kids as he left.  
兰格利先生一小时后赶来接他。真嗣的头部已经被表情不安的玛丽亚修女包扎好了，她的动作犹豫不决，说话也简短而结巴，仿佛他更像是一个易碎的炸弹而非一个受伤的男孩。她给了他止痛药缓解头痛。随后，他就被安排坐在校长办公室外，旁边坐着一位警察。这位警官似乎对整个事件感到不安，直到他和兰格利在一旁交谈后才稍微平静些。他穿着橄榄绿的制服，擦得锃亮的鞋子很快就在真嗣的椅子旁停下。真嗣无法判断这位警官是生气、烦恼还是失望。兰格利只是等着他站起来，然后一言不发地领着他离开。真嗣离开时，其他孩子们都盯着他看。

Langley sighed as they got into the car, pausing with his hands on the wheel. "Katsuragi is supposed to be here to handle things like this," he said, then started the engine and made for the estate. Shinji didn't have anything to say. So what if Misato wasn't here? She was never here, not unless it was to train. His body ached, and his knuckles stung, even being wrapped in neosporin and gauze. Sister Maria said he hadn't broken any fingers, but they'd be stiff for weeks. He could feel every fiber of split skin.  
兰利叹了口气，坐进车里，双手搭在方向盘上停顿了一下。“葛城应该是来处理这种事情的，”他说着，启动引擎，驶向庄园。真嗣无话可说。就算美里不在又怎样？她从来就不在，除非是为了训练。他的身体疼痛不已，手指关节更是刺痛，即便已经用新斯波林和纱布包扎。玛丽亚修女说他没有骨折，但手指会僵硬好几个星期。他能感受到每一丝裂开的皮肤。

They arrived at the estate, brick walls dark in the late evening. Sunlight crept beneath the horizon, blues and grays overtaking it in long shadows. Still, there was some light left to tinge the flowers in twilight. Langley walked around the side of his grand home, and Shinji knew he was meant to follow.  
他们抵达庄园，砖墙在傍晚时分显得格外深沉。阳光悄悄爬过地平线，蓝色和灰色在长长的阴影中接管了一切。尽管如此，仍有些许余晖在黄昏中点缀着花朵。兰利绕过他宏伟住宅的一侧，真嗣知道他应该跟随。

A tool box sat by the fountain amidst the roses, contents scattered atop it from the day before. Langley fit on a pair of gloves and handed some to Shinji. He stuffed them in his pocket and picked his favorite sheers – blue colored handles with rusting blades. He could've gotten new ones, but these were the pair Gepard had given him.  
工具箱就放在玫瑰丛中的喷泉旁，里面的东西从昨天起就散落在外。兰利戴上手套，递给真嗣一些。真嗣将它们塞进口袋，拿起他最喜欢的剪刀——蓝色手柄，刀片已经生锈。他本可以换新的，但这是捷豹送给他的那对。

Together, they started by the yellow _Hesperrhodos_ roses, clipping at thorns and dead branches. He had to use his left hand, its movements unrefined. Thin cuts began to appear.  
他们一起从黄色的赫斯珀洛多玫瑰开始，修剪着刺和枯枝。他不得不使用左手，动作显得笨拙。细小的伤口开始出现。

"You shouldn't do it bare handed," Langley said, nudging his chin in Shinji's direction. He only shrugged. So the man straightened on his haunches, arms resting on his thighs. "They had to take that boy to the hospital, you know."  
“你不该徒手做这个，”兰利说，用下巴示意了一下真嗣的方向。他只是耸了耸肩。于是那人蹲直了身子，双臂搭在腿上。“你知道，他们得把那孩子送到医院去。”

Shinji kept working, the thorns of the rose bushes covering every open space of the stalk before him. He could've killed Günter. Maybe with a mess of broken fingers by the end of it – training didn't translate well with rage – but he could've. The thought was alien to him, as if being spoken in another language. He had known they were being trained to do those things, or at least had an inkling before Misato really told him. But then... Moskva had said they were fighting monsters. Things called Angels. After that, he'd forgotten Weissenburg's first lesson in the art of soldiering.  
真嗣继续工作，玫瑰丛的刺覆盖了面前茎秆的每一处空隙。他本可以杀了京特尔。或许到最后会弄得手指骨折——训练在愤怒面前并不奏效——但他本可以的。这个念头对他来说很陌生，仿佛是用另一种语言说出来的。他知道他们被训练去做那些事，或者至少在美里真正告诉他之前就有过这样的预感。但后来……莫斯科瓦说他们在与怪物战斗，被称为使徒的东西。在那之后，他忘记了魏森堡关于士兵艺术的第一个教训。

It was after Shinji had beaten Asuka in a CQC practice. She had dropped her guard and he'd pinned her to the ground. Embarrassed, annoyed, and maybe a little hurt, she'd complained that if they were learning to fight, why couldn't they learn to use _real_ weapons yet?  
那是在真嗣在一次近身格斗训练中击败明日香之后。她放松了警惕，而他将她按倒在地。尴尬、恼怒，或许还有些许受伤，她抱怨说既然他们在学习战斗，为何还不能学习使用真正的武器呢？

Weissenburg came to his knees to address them, holding out his open palms. They were rough hands, but otherwise unremarkable. "Guns and knives are only tools to make killing more efficient," he said, pausing to look at both of them in turn. His hands closed into fists. "If you do not have those, you must be able to use the weapons you _do_ have."  
魏森堡跪下向他们解释，伸出他那双粗糙但并无特别之处的手掌。“枪和刀只是让杀戮更高效的工具，”他说着，停顿下来依次看向他们两人。他的手握成了拳头。“如果没有这些，你们必须能够使用你们所拥有的武器。”

Shinji's mind had been... turned off. Had been somewhere far away. Now that he dwelled on it, he didn't remember much of the actual fight. He just remembered that rush of anger. He just...  
真嗣的思绪曾经……关闭了。曾经飘向远方。现在仔细回想，他记不清那场战斗的具体细节。他只记得那股愤怒的冲动。他只是……

A lump twisted in his throat.  
他的喉咙里仿佛堵了一团东西。

Twilight started to fade and darkness overtook them.  
暮色开始消退，黑暗笼罩了他们。

"Don't worry," Langley said. "So long as you're a pilot, nothing will change."  
"别担心，"兰利说，"只要你还是飞行员，一切都不会变。"

Shinji didn't see the flowers much as he worked, mind falling inward, thinking about Günter in a hospital room surrounded by his family. If he still had one.  
工作时，真嗣并没有太注意那些花，他的思绪内敛，想着在医院病房里被家人围绕的冈瑟。如果他还有家人的话。

"Yes, sir." he said, knowing he should stay away from school for the rest of his time in Germany. There was no reason to go there. Erika had stopped trying to reach him and he didn't want to tell her he was leaving. He didn't want to see her cry.  
“是的，先生。”他说，知道自己应该在德国剩下的时间里远离学校。没有理由再去那里。艾丽卡已经停止尝试联系他，他也不想告诉她他要离开。他不想看到她哭泣。

"My daughter," Langley said, pulling him from those somber thoughts. The man was only a foot away, staring at a fresh cut across his wrist. "What's she like?"  
“我的女儿，”兰利说道，将他从那些忧郁的思绪中拉回。那人仅在一英尺之外，盯着他手腕上新鲜的伤口。“她是什么样的？”

Shinji's brow scrunched, confused. How could he not know? Hadn't they lived in the same house? What made him think he knew any better? "I don't know," Shinji said, going back to the roses, a knew frustration building. Langley set his gaze on him, waiting.  
真嗣的眉头紧皱，感到困惑。他怎么会不知道呢？难道他们不是住在同一个屋檐下吗？是什么让他觉得自己更了解情况？“我不知道，”真嗣说着，回到玫瑰花前，一种新的挫败感逐渐升起。兰利将目光投向他，等待着。

Shinji let out a sigh. "I mean... she's loud, and nosy, and isn't really all that prim and proper like everyone at school thinks she is. Sometimes she's mean... well, a lot of the time..." he stopped, for a moment horrified over what he'd let tumble out. A glance at Langley told him he wasn't about to evicted. The man's stoic expression didn't change, content to listen.  
真嗣叹了口气。“我是说……她很吵，爱管闲事，并不像学校里所有人认为的那样端庄得体。有时候她很刻薄……嗯，很多时候……”他停了下来，一时间对自己脱口而出的话感到震惊。瞥了一眼兰利，他知道自己不会被赶出去。兰利那张不动声色的表情没有变化，只是静静地听着。

So Shinji went on. "But... she just acts tough, I think. I guess I really don't know."  
于是真嗣继续说道。“但是……我觉得她只是装得很坚强。我想我真的不太了解她。”

That wasn't true of course. He knew a lot about Asuka, or he used to. How did he put something like that into words? His mind wandered to Unity Day, how he hadn't seen her since. Her window above was dark. She must've been out somewhere.  
当然，那并非事实。他曾对明日香了解甚多，或者说曾经如此。他该如何用言语表达那种感觉呢？他的思绪飘向了团结日，自那以后他再也没见过她。她楼上的窗户漆黑一片。她一定是在某个地方外出。

"I see," Langley said. “我明白了，”兰利说。

As night came in full, they packed the gloves and sheers away, going their separate ways home. Shinji went to sleep in his uniform, kept awake well into dark morning. Günter's broken face wouldn't leave him, a long thorn stuck deep in his brain. It shouldn't have bothered him so much – the fight. Asuka's absence. He'd been getting along just fine without her. He didn't need her to defend him. But he'd let himself rely on her for too long, made himself blind to Swina and his betrayal. Made himself fall for feelings towards Erika that weren't as real as he thought.  
夜幕完全降临，他们收拾好手套和剪刀，各自回家。真嗣穿着制服入睡，直到深夜仍无法入眠。京特那张破碎的脸挥之不去，像一根长刺深深扎在他的脑海中。这场争斗，明日香的缺席，本不该让他如此困扰。没有她，他也能过得很好。他不需要她来保护。但他让自己依赖她太久了，让自己对斯维娜和他的背叛视而不见。让自己对艾丽卡的感情变得不再真实，不像他以为的那样。

So that night, Shinji decided.  
于是那个夜晚，真嗣下定了决心。

He decided he would never rely on anyone again.  
他决定再也不依赖任何人。

When light came, Shinji prepared for school. There was one last thing he had to do before he left. A familiar girl's voice echoed out of the open windows of the Langley house. He thought of stopping in only for a fleeting second. There was a part of him that wanted to face Asuka instead of the two people huddled under the shelter of Building A's brick wall.  
天亮时，真嗣准备去上学。离开前，他还有最后一件事要做。一个熟悉的女孩声音从兰格雷家的窗户里传了出来。他本想只停留片刻。内心有一部分渴望去面对明日香，而不是躲在 A 栋砖墙下避雨的两个人。

Swina looked up as he approached. Shinji pretended he wasn't there. Erika was engrossed in her phone, but soon sensed his eyes on her.  
斯维娜抬头看着他走近。真嗣假装没注意到。埃丽卡正全神贯注于手机，但很快察觉到他的目光。

"I have to leave," he said as she opened her mouth.  
“我得走了，”她刚要开口，他就说道。

Erika flinched. "What?" he hated the hurt in her voice, and decided to stare at her shoes.  
埃丽卡一颤。“什么？”他讨厌她声音里的受伤，于是决定盯着她的鞋子。

"My father says I have to move to Tokyo-3."  
"我父亲说我必须搬到第三新东京市。"

She stood up, quick, but didn't move away from the wall. One hand clutched at the pleats of her skirt. "When?"  
她迅速站起身，但没有离开墙边。一只手紧抓着裙子的褶皱。“什么时候？”

"A few days." "就这几天。"

Kids shouted from the halls nearby, oblivious to them. Lockers creaked and slammed closed.  
孩子们在附近的走廊上喊叫，对他们毫不在意。储物柜吱吱作响，砰地一声关上了。

Erika's voice cracked. "That's not fair."  
埃丽卡的声音变得沙哑。"那不公平。"

"Lots of things aren't fair," Shinji said, regretting it too late. He looked up and that was it – her bright blue eyes on the verge of tears. There was nothing he could do. Nothing he could say. The words just wouldn't come. So he turned and left, walking as fast as he could.  
“很多事情都不公平，”真嗣说道，但后悔已经太迟了。他抬起头，一切都结束了——她那双明亮的蓝眼睛噙着泪水。他无能为力，无话可说。那些话就是说不出口。于是他转身离开，尽可能快地走着。

At some point, he started running.  
在某一刻，他开始奔跑。

---

Night crawled forth, bleeding the sky of color as it drew ever nearer. Even resting on the short S-bahn ride to Bernau, Shinji still felt the crushing sting in his sides and doubled over at the front gates of the Langley estate. Weissenburg's gruff voice howled at him from the past, demanding he stand straight and give his lungs proper oxygen. Eyes cast back down the road, he wondered how long he had been running, Berlin left in the distance. Feeling came back in sweat slick skin and muscles that oozed, so sore his legs trembled.  
夜幕缓缓降临，将天空的色彩一点点吞噬，越来越近。即便是在前往伯瑙的短途 S-Bahn 列车上稍作休息，真嗣仍能感受到两侧肋骨下那令人窒息的刺痛，他在兰格利庄园的大门前弯下了腰。魏森堡粗鲁的声音在他记忆中咆哮，命令他挺直腰板，让肺部充分呼吸。他回头望向那条路，心中疑惑自己已经跑了多久，柏林已被远远抛在身后。汗水浸湿的皮肤和肌肉中渐渐恢复了知觉，双腿酸痛得颤抖。

He stood there, gulping in air and staring up at the Estate before deciding it was time to go home. The quiet trees and whispering shrubs were out of place tonight, the dark red of sunset casting them in a sinister light. His small Japanese shack came into view.  
他站在那里，大口喘着气，抬头凝视着庄园，决定是时候回家了。今晚，静谧的树木和低语的灌木显得格格不入，夕阳的暗红色调将它们笼罩在一种不祥的光芒中。他那间小小的日本小屋映入眼帘。

Nowhere was home now. 无处可归，如今。

He found her in his room, rifling through his things. She stood as he entered, though only acknowledged him with a glance, acting as if she had every right to be there throwing his belongings about. As though she'd seen him only yesterday instead of months ago. She was wearing a soft pink dress scattered with blue and lavender flowers – something that felt distinctly un-Asuka like, yet didn't appear out of place on her.  
他在自己的房间里找到了她，她正翻找着他的东西。当他进来时，她站了起来，尽管只是瞥了他一眼，表现得好像她完全有权在那里乱扔他的物品。仿佛她昨天才见过他，而不是几个月前。她穿着一件柔软的粉色连衣裙，上面点缀着蓝色和紫色的花朵——这感觉与明日香的风格截然不同，但在她身上却并不显得突兀。

"What are you doing in my room?" he asked, feeling something starting to come to a boil in his stomach.  
“你在我房间里做什么？”他问道，感觉胃里有什么东西开始沸腾起来。

Asuka jumped, but then shrugged as she pried open another drawer, making an annoyed growl when whatever it was she was looking for didn't appear. Some of his sketch pads were thrown atop the bed, pages splayed open. He nearly stepped forward, stopping when she spotted something in one of the other drawers, though he couldn't see what she picked up. Her shoulders drooped a little, only for a second or two, and she whirled around, scathing words on the tip of her tongue. At least until she took in the raw cuts and bruises decorating his face.  
明日香跳了起来，随即耸了耸肩，又打开一个抽屉，当她要找的东西没有出现时，发出了一声恼怒的咕哝。他的几本素描本被扔在床上，页面摊开着。他几乎要走上前去，但当她发现另一个抽屉里的东西时停了下来，尽管他看不清她拿起了什么。她的肩膀微微下垂，只持续了一两秒，然后她猛地转过身来，尖刻的话语已经到了嘴边。至少在她看到他脸上那些裸露的割伤和瘀伤之前。

"What happened to you?" she asked, furious. Anyone else would have missed the concern beneath it. She stepped forward, hand reaching out to touch the gash over his eye.  
“你这是怎么了？”她问道，怒气冲冲。换作别人可能没注意到她隐藏的关切。她走上前，手伸出去触碰他眼上的伤口。

He brushed her arm away, taking a step back. "Why do you care?" he snapped, unable to think beyond the hammering of his heart. All of his belongings lay about, drawings exposed and bare – closet tossed open and contents spilled out like an open wound. A desk drawer hung crooked: old watches, coins and shoe laces scattered to the floor. Misato's beret lay somewhere amidst it all.  
他推开她的手臂，后退了一步。“你为什么在乎？”他厉声说道，无法思考，只感到心跳如鼓。他所有的东西都散落一地，画作暴露无遗——衣橱大开，里面的东西像伤口一样散落出来。一个书桌抽屉歪斜着：旧手表、硬币和鞋带散落一地。美里的大檐帽就混在其中。

A storm had swept through his room.  
一场风暴席卷了他的房间。

"You made a mess," Shinji said, feeling his expression twist into a grimace, full of disdain. Asuka became guarded, her arms stiff at her sides. He wanted to scream at her. His right hand trembled, remembering the same blind fury that had gripped him only a day before.  
“你弄得一团糟，”真嗣说道，感到自己的表情扭曲成了一副厌恶的鬼脸。明日香变得警觉起来，双臂僵硬地垂在身侧。他真想冲她大吼。他的右手颤抖着，回想起仅仅一天前同样盲目愤怒的情绪。

Shinji started to clean up, pretending that his old friend had already been swept up and vanished into the garden. She stayed where she was, and he could feel her watching him as he collected his books and tucked clothes and binders back in the closet.  
真嗣开始收拾，假装他的老朋友已经被卷走，消失在花园里。她站在原地不动，他能感觉到她在注视着他，看着他收拾书本，把衣服和文件夹重新放回衣柜。

"Are you going to come up to the house or what?" she asked once he'd put everything away, tone haughty. She hadn't lifted a finger to help.  
"你到底要不要上楼来？" 她在他把所有东西都收拾好后问道，语气傲慢。她可是一点忙都没帮。

"No. I have a lot of homework to do." he said. A lie.  
"不了。我有很多作业要做。" 他说。这是个谎言。

Her voice sounded tight. "Fine. Stay here for all I care." and then she was gone.  
她的声音听起来很紧绷。"好吧。你爱待这儿就待着吧。" 然后她就离开了。

Shinji frowned, kicking one of the half open drawers. What did she have to be angry about? All she'd done was ignore him and then – and then this. Even that justification didn't stop him from feeling utterly rotten. He shouldn't have said that. He shouldn't have said anything. Stupid. Stupid thing to do. For an aching minute, Shinji considered going up to the house anyway and finding her. Hooks stuck in him, formed from pent up emotions that had him angry again. She may as well have been a stranger to him.  
真嗣皱起眉头，踢了一脚半开的抽屉。她有什么好生气的？她所做的不过是忽视他，然后——然后就这样了。即便如此，他还是感到无比糟糕。他不该说那句话的。他什么也不该说。真蠢。做了一件蠢事。痛苦的一分钟里，真嗣考虑着还是上楼去找她。钩子般的东西刺痛着他，是压抑已久的情绪让他再次愤怒。她对他来说简直就像个陌生人。

The last out of place item he plucked from the floor was an envelope with some soup stains. The letter from Asuka that he'd never opened. Out of a doubt masked by spite, he left it on his desk, where it remained sealed.  
他从地板上捡起的最后一件不协调物品是一个沾有汤渍的信封。那封他从未打开过的来自明日香的信。出于被怨恨掩盖的疑虑，他把它留在了书桌上，依旧封存着。

For a while, Shinji actually _did_ try to do homework. It didn't matter anymore, but maybe it would take his mind off things. He ended up sitting there for an hour, staring at nothing. 23 tracks passed. Miki Matsubara again – _wash_. He tugged the earbuds out and tossed the SDAT at the closet, still playing. A hand combed through his hair, grabbing some of it in a knot. Then something caught his eye.  
有一阵子，真嗣确实尝试着做作业。现在这已经无关紧要了，但也许能让他的思绪从这些事情上移开。结果他坐在那里发呆了一个小时。23 首曲子过去了。又是松原美纪——洗脑。他拽出耳塞，把 SDAT 扔进衣柜，还在播放。一只手梳理着他的头发，抓起一撮打了个结。然后有什么东西吸引了他的目光。

Miki's voice whispered through the buds, right beside a stuffed animal that'd fallen free of the chaos in his closet. Shinji moved to pick it up, recognizing the thing. A plain, pudgy little monkey doll.  
Miki 的声音透过耳机轻声传来，旁边是一个从他衣柜的混乱中掉出来的毛绒玩具。真嗣走过去捡起它，认出了这个东西。一个普通、胖乎乎的小猴子玩偶。

He sat on his bed with it, examining the clean fabric. Dirt stains just barely showed. He'd asked Teacher to sew it for him, back when he first found it. The man refused, so Shinji learned to sew. It had taken weeks, and a whole box of band-aids for his poor fingers.  
他坐在床上，仔细检查着干净的布料。只有轻微的污渍。他曾请求老师为他缝补，那是在他第一次发现它的时候。老师拒绝了，于是真嗣学会了缝纫。这花了几个星期，还有一整盒创可贴来保护他可怜的手指。

Shinji left it by his pillow, body aching, needing to move. He decided to tend the garden in the dark, feeling the vines and flowers close off from him in preparation for the night. It wasn't long before he found himself, as always, by the roses again, patrolling them each but not caring to trim or hedge. One of them caught his shirt as he moved by.  
真嗣把它放在枕头旁边，身体疼痛，需要活动。他决定在黑暗中照料花园，感觉到藤蔓和花朵在为夜晚做准备，逐渐与他隔绝。没过多久，他又像往常一样，来到了玫瑰花丛前，巡视着每一株，却并不在意修剪或整理。其中一朵玫瑰在他经过时勾住了他的衬衫。

It was _Hesperrhodos_, a western rose that held a pinkish, yellow hue. It must have been the same bush he'd once cut his arm on. None of the others held quite the same rich, vibrant color. His fingers skimmed through its leaves, sheers carefully picking away at errant stems or dead wood. He recalled – almost fondly – falling into it after being pushed. The thorns pricked his fingers, but he didn't care – he'd gotten used to it a long time ago. Next to the bush was the Amaranthus flower, always so out of place within the rose garden, thriving despite the biting thorns and bushes that overshadowed it in their competition for sunlight.  
那是赫斯佩罗斯，一株西方的玫瑰，带着淡粉与黄的色调。想必就是那棵他曾割伤手臂的灌木。其他的都没有如此浓郁、生动的色彩。他的手指轻拂过叶片，剪刀小心翼翼地剔除杂枝或枯木。他几乎带着怀念地想起，自己曾被人推入其中。刺扎进了他的手指，但他并不在意——他早已习惯了。灌木旁是苋菜花，在这玫瑰园中总是显得格格不入，尽管有尖锐的刺和茂密的灌木在争夺阳光，它依然茂盛。

All those years of adversity had finally started to wear away at it. The edges of the Amaranthus were touched with tinges of blackish brown, though the radiance of its petals hadn't diminished in the slightest. He hoped it wasn't dying. It would be a shame after all these years. Maybe if he moved the Amaranthus, it would still grow. Maybe he could still save it.  
多年逆境的侵蚀终于开始磨损它。苋菜花的边缘染上了黑棕色的斑点，尽管花瓣的光彩丝毫未减。他希望它没有在凋零。经历了这么多年，那将是一种遗憾。也许如果他移动苋菜花，它还能继续生长。也许他还能救它。

His hands dipped into the soil, surprisingly soft and rich. He had no idea how deep the roots went, but if he was careful...  
他的手探入土壤，意外地柔软而肥沃。他不知道根有多深，但如果他小心行事……

It was meticulous work, and the night was warm and calm enough for the mosquitoes to start making a meal of him. Trailing some dirt, he brought the frail little Amaranthus to the olive tree. Grass had covered the small clearing, the tree's leaves fuller and more widespread than he remembered. The trunk had grown fatter too, its roots stretching farther.  
这是细致的工作，夜色温暖而宁静，蚊子开始把他当作美餐。他带着一株纤弱的苋菜，穿过一些泥土，来到橄榄树下。草丛覆盖了这片小空地，树的叶子比他记忆中更茂密、更宽广。树干也变粗了，根系延伸得更远。

At the center of the clearing Shinji started to dig out a new plot. During the day, it would get all the sunlight it needed and, without other plants to crowd it, have enough water to gather from the rains.  
在空地的中央，真嗣开始挖掘一个新的地块。白天，它将获得充足的阳光，而且没有其他植物拥挤，可以从雨水中收集足够的水分。

It would be able to grow now.  
现在它能够生长了。

Still, as silly as the thought was, Shinji couldn't help but think the clearing was awfully lonely for the Amaranthus.  
尽管这个想法很傻，但真嗣还是忍不住觉得这片空地对紫菀花来说太过孤单了。

---

It didn't seem so long ago that he wandered into the Langley's vast garden, banished from the only home and family he'd ever known. Well, that place wasn't home, not like Germany was – but he supposed it soon would be.  
仿佛不久前，他才漫步进入兰利家广阔的花园，被逐出了他唯一知道的家和家庭。好吧，那地方并不算家，不像德国那样——但他猜想，很快就会是了。

Shinji perused the garden one more time, familiar with each hidden path and stone, each fern and birch. The memories attached to their smells and their feel didn't come – he wouldn't let them. At least until he met again with the olive tree. Moments hidden in each huge, swirling finger of root coming together at the trunk and spreading out from the branches to greet the sunshine.  
真嗣再次审视了一遍花园，对每一条隐秘的小径和石头，每一片蕨类和桦树都了如指掌。那些附着在它们气味和触感上的记忆没有涌来——他不会让它们涌来。至少在他再次见到那棵橄榄树之前不会。那些隐藏在每一根巨大的、旋转的树根中的时刻，它们在树干处汇聚，又从枝条上伸展出去迎接阳光。

Shinji, setting his duffel bag down, took a red sash from his NERV-issue tan trousers – provided with the new military uniform mailed in with his transfer orders. The material was stiff, and though it fit just fine, the sight of him in it was still an oddity. Even with Misato's red beret snug over his head. He'd spent so long in the Kloster's jackets and ties, that this new image was unrecognizable. He supposed he would get used to that too.  
真嗣放下他的旅行袋，从 NERV 发放的卡其色长裤中取出一条红色腰带——这是随调令寄来的新军装的一部分。布料硬挺，虽然合身，但他穿上这身衣服的样子仍显得古怪。即便米萨托的红色贝雷帽紧扣在他头上。他在修道院的夹克和领带中度过了太久，这个新形象让他几乎认不出自己。他猜自己也会习惯的。

Unfurling the crimson cloth in his hands, he stepped up the welcoming roots of the olive tree. Asuka hadn't been home when he willed the courage somewhere to check around lunch time. Yesterday had been her last night in before leaving for Heidelberg again. Gone early in the morning. So he came out here with the noon sky overhead and tied the sash around an arm of the tree. He wouldn't have to return it now.  
他展开手中的红布，踏上了橄榄树欢迎的根须。中午时分，他鼓起勇气四处查看时，明日香还没回家。昨天是她再次前往海德堡之前的最后一晚。一大早就离开了。于是他在这正午的天空下，来到这里，将腰带系在树枝上。现在他不必再归还它了。

Shinji bowed to Teacher and thanked him before he left.  
真嗣向老师鞠躬致谢后离开。

Saturated bursts of white from cooling air and water vapor lorded over the skies, distant travelers soaring in. Shinji, now standing on an air-pad with Misato at NERV-03, watched them float overhead. The screaming of a VTOL's engines grew to a high-pitched sting in his ears, upsetting the air as it touched down. He and Misato boarded, settling in for the journey divided between three flights. They were going to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Misato said that's where their 4th Branch was situated. From there they would board a military transport flying out to New Yokosuka, and then they would be traveling by car to Tokyo-3.  
冷却的空气与水蒸气爆发出饱和的白色，主宰着天空，远行的旅人翱翔而至。真嗣现在站在 NERV-03 的气垫上，与美里一同，注视着它们从头顶飘过。一架垂直起降飞机的引擎尖啸声逐渐变成刺耳的噪音，扰乱了空气，当它降落时。他和美里登上了飞机，准备分三段飞行前往哈萨克斯坦的拜科努尔航天发射场。美里说那里是他们第四分部的所在地。从那里他们将搭乘一架军用运输机飞往新横须贺，然后再乘车前往第三新东京市。

The prospect of seeing the city up close excited him a little and he let himself look forward to going to Japan again, if nothing else than to fight down his anxiety. At least Misato was traveling with him.  
亲眼见到这座城市的希望让他有些兴奋，他让自己期待再次前往日本，即便只是为了压制内心的焦虑。至少美里与他同行。

"Are you sure you don't want to go say goodbye?" she asked, studying him from the seat adjacent. "There's a base near Heidelberg we can land at before getting on course."  
“你确定不想去道个别吗？”她从邻座注视着他问道，“我们可以在航线调整前降落在海德堡附近的一个基地。”

He shook his head. "No. She's probably busy," he said, looking out the window.  
他摇了摇头。“不，她可能正忙着。”他说着，望向窗外。

"Are you sure?" "你确定吗？"

He answered with silence and they stayed the course without detour. Shinji turned his right arm over in his lap, grabbing his wrist as he inspected the long sliver of discolored skin left behind after the rosebush had cut him open at only five.  
他用沉默回应，他们就这样一路前行，没有偏离轨道。真嗣将右臂翻转放在膝上，握住手腕，仔细察看那片长长的、因玫瑰丛在他仅五岁时划破而留下的变色皮肤。

They talked little on the trip, or at least Shinji did. Misato was hard to stop once she got going, not that he wanted to. Much like Asuka and Erika, she was able to hold long, rambling conversations almost entirely by herself. He wondered if that was just a girl thing. Once they transferred at Baikonur, she told him it had been decided that he would be living with her, since he wasn't old enough to live on his own yet.  
旅途中他们很少交谈，至少真嗣是这样。美里一旦开始就很难停下来，但这并不是他想阻止的。和明日香及艾丽卡一样，她能独自进行漫长而漫无边际的对话。他好奇这是否只是女孩子的特质。在拜科努尔转车时，她告诉他，由于他还未成年，不能独自生活，所以决定让他和她一起住。

She breezed over it, hoping he wouldn't question the order, but he knew who had decided that. The fears he'd been ignoring as a child, despite creeping suspicions, were confirmed for the second time in a month. His father didn't want anything to do with him. Asuka had been right.  
她轻描淡写地略过，希望他不会追问这个命令的由来，但他知道是谁决定的。那些他童年时虽有疑虑却一直忽视的恐惧，在一个月内第二次得到了证实。他的父亲不想与他有任何瓜葛。明日香是对的。

"Here we are!" Misato cheered, pointing for him to look out the window. The sky was black by then, but Shinji could clearly see fragments of moonlight lapping off the waters of a lake. Beyond that, a midnight city glistened with neon at the feet of dark pillars dotted with orange. Sentinels of steel and glass guarding a secluded valley. Cold concrete walled off the metropolis and its ordered water purification pools and quiet honeycomb clusters of solar panels. The most advanced city on the planet, a hub of human ingenuity greater than the sprawl of Chicago-2 in America.  
"我们到了！" 美里兴奋地指着窗外让他看。那时天空已是一片漆黑，但真嗣能清楚地看到月光在水面上荡漾的碎片。远处，一座午夜的城市在黑暗的柱子脚下闪烁着霓虹灯，柱子上点缀着橙色。钢铁与玻璃的哨兵守护着一个隐秘的山谷。冰冷的混凝土墙隔绝了这座大都市及其有序的水净化池和安静的太阳能电池板蜂窝状集群。这是地球上最先进的城市，人类智慧的中心，比美国的芝加哥-2 更胜一筹。

"Home sweet home!" Misato cheered.  
"甜蜜的家！" 美里欢呼道。

"Yeah," he said, taking in the warm glow pooling off every building and illuminating every road, soft like embers of a dwindling fire. The heavy black mountains all around rose like waves to consume Tokyo-3's gentle radiance. A weak flame in a land that otherwise looked empty and barren.  
“是啊，”他说着，目光所及之处，每一座建筑散发着温暖的光芒，照亮了每一条道路，柔和如渐熄之火的余烬。四周沉重的黑色山峦仿佛巨浪般升起，欲吞噬第三新东京市的温婉光辉。在这片看似空旷荒凉的土地上，它犹如一缕微弱的火焰。

"Home sweet home." “家，甜蜜的家。”

At the Langley estate, the garden remained empty, its occupants cast out to the world. The pathways became overgrown, stones uplifted and consumed. Water stopped flowing through the fountains, run dry until they held nothing but the baked corpses of lizards. In the clearing with the old olive tree, the Amaranthus started to succumb to a slow, cellular rot that sapped away its vigor and life. When it shriveled and dipped down to touch the barren soil at its roots, its rich color remained. Unfading.  
在兰利庄园，花园依旧空荡，其居民已被逐出，融入世界。小径杂草丛生，石块翘起并被吞噬。喷泉中的水流停止了，干涸至极，仅剩下被烤干的蜥蜴尸体。在古老的橄榄树旁的空地上，苋菜开始遭受缓慢的细胞腐烂，逐渐耗尽其活力与生命。当它枯萎下垂，触及根部贫瘠的土壤时，其丰富的色彩依旧未褪，永不凋零。

**A/N:** Well, that concludes the first of four acts for Amarantos. There will eventually be a brief Interlude chapter featuring Misato and Weissenburg, but - unfortunately - it'll be quite a while before I actually publish Act II. Life is time consuming and so is indulging in fanfic. I don't want to rush out any chapters, so I'll only start posting Act II when I have it sufficiently fleshed out. Think of it like waiting for the release of a second book.  
作者注：至此，《阿玛兰托斯》的第一幕四章已全部结束。后续将有一篇短暂的间奏章节，讲述美里和魏森堡的故事，但遗憾的是，第二幕的发布还需等待相当长的时间。生活繁忙，沉浸于同人创作亦是如此。我不愿仓促推出任何章节，因此只有在第二幕构思充分后才会开始发布。这就像等待第二本书的发行一样，需要耐心。

Until then, I'd like to thank you all again for your comments/thoughts/criticisms and I hope to see you around for Act II.  
在此期间，我想再次感谢大家的评论、想法和批评，并期待在第二幕中与你们再次相遇。

## Act II
### Chapter 1: Reunion
The air was filled with smoke and blood.  
空气中弥漫着烟雾和血腥味。

Thick, fuming black columns stained the buildings suspended high above where a chasm gaped in the ceiling of the GeoFront, the edges of it rusted through from the Angel's slow, decaying descent through Tokyo-3's thick alloy. Sirens sang in answer to the destruction as fire blazed across the expanse below, illuminating its megalithic chrome walls while waves of ash and heat flowed over a hard-edged titan, its bright armor blackened with energy scouring and soot. Within, the plug canopy was doused in a stinging crimson, warning panels pulsing along its length as alert systems wailed for the pilot's attention. An earsplitting chorus of buzzers, electronic tones and high-pitched rings.  
浓密的黑烟柱玷污了悬浮在高空的建筑，地底都市的穹顶裂开一道深渊，边缘因天使缓慢腐朽地穿透东京-3 厚重的合金而锈蚀。警报声回应着破坏，火焰在下方广阔区域肆虐，照亮了其巨大的铬合金墙体，而灰烬与热浪如潮水般涌过坚硬边缘的巨人，其闪亮的装甲被能量扫荡和煤烟染黑。内部，插入栓的护罩被刺眼的猩红浸染，警告面板沿着其长度脉动，警报系统呼唤着驾驶员的注意。一阵震耳欲聋的蜂鸣器、电子音和高频铃声的合唱。

Comm traffic heavy with static poured over the BattleFreq. _"Negative conductor suffering power outages, mountings in the undercarriage are loose."_  
战斗频率中充斥着静电干扰的通讯。"导电体遭遇电力中断，底盘支架松动。"

_"Supply bands one through seven, eighteen through twenty-four severed from overload, we're getting coolant spills in the cable lines."  
"供应带一到七，十八到二十四因过载被切断，电缆线路出现冷却剂泄漏。"_

_"Unit-one's power is still stable, the railgun can handle it."  
"一号单元的电力仍然稳定，轨道炮可以承受。"_

_"And the shield?" "那护盾呢？"_

As if in response, Unit-01's left arm sagged to hang at its side. The shield latched to the forearm plating, now nothing more than a hunk of twisted metal, slid from its anchors and crashed to the ground. Smoke poured off the charred appendage.  
仿佛是在回应，零一号机的左臂无力地垂下，挂在身侧。固定在前臂装甲上的盾牌，如今只是一块扭曲的金属，从固定点滑落，重重地砸在地上。烧焦的肢体冒出滚滚浓烟。

_"Left arm inoperable." “左臂无法操作。”_

_"Energy build up from the Angel!"  
“使徒引发的能量积聚！”_

Miles across the wasted landscape, what Shinji's target acquisition relay casually named Ramiel – a giant domed mass resembling an _amanitas_, colored the same bone-white as the vertebrae structure hanging down beneath it – elicited a shrill, animal scream. Melting pain erupted under his skin as light poured into the Eva's upper chest. He reacted on reflex, screaming from the sensation of muscle and sinew burning away. The railgun in Unit-01's grasp snapped with arcs of electricity and a projectile burst from the muzzle, tearing sound with a deafening _boom_.  
横跨荒芜的景象，Shinji 的目标获取中继系统随意命名的 Ramiel——一个巨大的穹顶状物体，酷似鹅膏菌，颜色与悬挂其下的脊椎结构一样骨白——引发了一声尖锐的动物般的尖叫。光芒涌入 Eva 上胸时，他皮肤下爆发出融化的痛楚。他本能地反应，因肌肉和肌腱燃烧的感觉而尖叫。Unit-01 手中的电磁炮随着电弧的跳动而断裂，一枚弹丸从炮口喷射而出，伴随着震耳欲聋的轰鸣撕裂了空气。

The round shattered a hole in the GeoFront wall, rattling the underground fortress with violent tremors. Buildings fell from their anchors above and threw up clouds of debris upon meeting the ground.  
弹丸在 GeoFront 的墙壁上击碎了一个洞，地下堡垒因剧烈的震动而颤抖。上方的建筑物从锚点坠落，与地面碰撞时扬起了滚滚尘埃。

An alert flared, voices at headquarters shouted a warning, but Shinji already knew. He commanded Unit-01 to turn, growling at the ripping strain it put on his arms. The machine swung about with the weight of the railgun to face the Angel, which had cut its beam short to teleport behind him, still keeping a safe distance in the wide underground expanse. In the back of his mind, he was relieved. If it closed the distance, he would be within reach of its decay field – disconnected from his power supply and the all-seeing eyes of headquarters. Cut off from any signal or retreat.  
警报闪烁，总部的人声嘶喊着发出警告，但真嗣早已知晓。他命令初号机转身，低吼着承受撕裂般的双臂压力。机甲携带着轨道炮的重负转向面对使徒，使徒已中断其光束以传送至他身后，仍保持在一个广阔地下空间内的安全距离。在他内心深处，他感到一丝宽慰。如果使徒缩短距离，他将进入其衰变场范围内——与电源和总部无所不见的监视断开联系。切断任何信号或撤退的可能。

Shinji was already pulling the trigger as the heavy barreled weapon came about. A red warning chirped next to his face.  
当重型炮管武器转向时，真嗣已经扣动了扳机。红色警告音在他脸旁响起。

_Capacitors still cooling_.  
电容器仍在冷却中。

Another shot would tear the weapon apart if he didn't wait. Energy readings form the Angel spiked. The targeter wasn't aligned yet. Shinji pulled the trigger. A second, thunderous _boom_ sucked up all other sound, a wash of pain swallowing his right shoulder and the side of his face as the Angel's core, buried within its vertebrae stem, vibrated and spun flaying streams of light.  
再开一枪，武器就要散架了，如果他不等待的话。使徒的能量读数急剧上升。瞄准器还未校准。真嗣扣动了扳机。第二声雷鸣般的巨响吞噬了所有其他声音，一阵剧痛席卷他的右肩和脸颊一侧，使徒的核心，深藏于其脊椎根部，振动并旋转，撕裂出光流。

Then Ramiel shrieked again with a sudden, jagged hole punched in its spinal cord, a chunk of the core going with it. Cracks spread into iceberg splitting fissures across its porcelain form and mass moaned as it fell, earth shattering in rolling swells with its impact. A chorus of squishy cracks, like rolling all the bones in his neck, sounded as it landed.  
随后雷米尔再次尖啸，脊椎上突然被击出一个参差不齐的洞，核心的一部分随之而去。裂纹如冰山裂缝般在其瓷器般的身躯上蔓延，随着其倒下，大地在撞击中震颤，如同滚滚波涛。它落地时发出一连串湿漉漉的碎裂声，就像扭动脖子上的所有骨头一样。

Unit-01, dashed with flurries of flame, shuddered, the motors in its right arm whirring as it dipped with the weight of the railgun. Its knees wobbled and collapsed, lights flickering over its frame as they struggled through power fluctuations. Red fluid oozed from its chest and upper shoulder, pauldron cut off and underwire mangled. Fortified layers of titanium glowed red from the scouring heat.  
零号机，火焰纷飞中颤抖着，右臂的马达因轨道炮的重量而嗡嗡作响，膝盖摇晃并最终跪倒，机体上的灯光在电力波动中挣扎闪烁。红色液体从其胸口和上肩渗出，肩甲被切断，内部线路扭曲。强化钛合金层因高温而泛红。

Shinji felt his muscles tighten and strain. A new warning cropped up _– high sync-rate causing negative feedback anomalies. Left arm connection attempt: failed. Right arm functionality: declining._ Shinji disabled it and the rest, a raw headache already breaking against his skull. His vitals were sharp, he could feel it in the break-neck pounding of his heart and the bloated catch in his throat. It felt like he was melting from the inside.  
真嗣感到肌肉紧绷，用力过度。新的警告出现了——高同步率导致负面反馈异常。左臂连接尝试：失败。右臂功能：下降。真嗣关闭了它和其他所有功能，一阵剧烈的头痛已经开始冲击他的头骨。他的生命体征异常，他能感受到心脏急速跳动和喉咙里膨胀的窒息感。感觉就像是从内部开始融化。

_"Shinji, you've turned off your early warning system, what's wrong?"  
“真嗣，你关闭了早期预警系统，怎么了？”_

"Nothing." Everything was wrong. He didn't know if the Eva could take much more. What would he do if the right arm failed?  
“没什么。”一切都错了。他不知道 Eva 还能承受多少。如果右臂也失效了，他该怎么办？

_"Energy readings from the target are fading, pattern dissipating."  
目标的能量读数正在减弱，模式消散。_

Caught up in the cloud of dust and debris it had created, the Angel grew still, every moment or so straining in small spasms, the ripping of its sinew creating a sound like peeling an orange.  
被自己制造的尘云和碎片困住，使徒静止下来，每隔一会儿便在小抽搐中挣扎，其肌腱撕裂的声音如同剥橘子一般。

Even with spirals of relief tickling his neck and shoulders, Shinji's every nerve pooled with the body of Eva, the weight of its armor his weight, the burns on its skin his skin. Over a tundra of ash and black soil, Shinji lingered on the smoking, discarded form of Unit-00. Data pinged to life by his head, taking readings from on-board sensors yet to be fried. Rei had stopped broadcasting over the comms minutes ago. No one was even talking about her.  
尽管解脱的螺旋在他脖颈和肩膀上轻挠，真嗣的每一根神经都与 EVA 的躯体融为一体，装甲的重量就是他的重量，皮肤上的烧伤也是他的皮肤。在一片灰烬和黑土的荒原上，真嗣凝视着冒烟的废弃 0 号机。数据在他头边闪现，从尚未烧毁的机载传感器中获取读数。绫波已经停止通过通讯系统广播几分钟了。甚至没有人提到她。

"_It's still operational?"_ he heard Misato ask.  
"它还在运作吗？" 他听到美里问道。

"_Marginally. Core integrity is only two percent and its Ego-Barrier is fading."_  
"勉强算是。核心完整性只有百分之二，而且它的自我屏障正在消退。"

"_At the rate of decay, it'll be silent within the hour."_  
"按照这种衰减速度，它将在一小时内彻底沉默。"

"_Can it still hit us?"_  
"它还能击中我们吗？"

"_Unconfir- hang on. Energy buildup around the core!"_  
"尚未确认——等等。核心周围能量正在积聚！"

"_Is it going to fire again?"_  
"它要再次开火了吗？"

"_No, I… I think it's trying to self-destruct."_  
“不，我……我觉得它要自毁了。”

Shinji flinched, eyes flickering to the downed Angel, Unit-01 responding to thought and attempting to heft the railgun just a little higher, but it stalled with metallic screeches. Massive electrical cords pouring from the rear of its frame hissed and spat sparks. Internally, something rattled the frame with an unseen burst. Experimental, its metals were weak from the trauma of accelerating rounds – the weapon had reached its limit. It was done.  
真嗣一惊，目光转向倒地的使徒，初号机随着意念试图将轨道炮稍稍抬高，却因金属摩擦的尖锐声而停滞。巨大的电缆从其框架后部涌出，嘶嘶作响并迸发火花。内部某处，一股无形的力量使框架震动。实验性的金属因加速弹丸的冲击而变得脆弱——武器已达到极限。它完了。

Unit-01 rose and took a step forward.  
初号机起身，向前迈了一步。

_"Shinji, umbrella your A.T. field and hold your position."  
“真嗣，用你的 A.T.力场撑起防护伞，坚守阵地。”_

His eyes went back to Rei, to the silent Unit-00, as he became aware of the cold, piercing feeling pressing into him like a cocoon of knives. It was new every time he felt it, but didn't belong to him in any way. Always an intruder to his consciousness. It was all around and in every direction. His whole body was tense with it, the nerve-ripping perception of his surroundings as his senses honed in on the pain, urging him to fight, remembering the beam burning through him only moments ago.  
他的目光再次转向绫波，转向沉默的零号机，同时感受到一股冰冷刺骨的感觉如刀刃般包裹着他，如同置身于刀丛之中。这种感觉每次都新鲜无比，却又不属于他分毫，总是作为他意识中的入侵者。它无处不在，四面八方。他的整个身体因之紧绷，神经撕裂般的感知着周围环境，他的感官聚焦于疼痛，催促他战斗，回想起不久前光束穿透他的那一刻。

Fear.

Shinji knew, from their last sortie, what it smelled like when an Eva's bio-layers oozed together into hot mush. How the taste of it stained the air. Burned with the sharp scent of cordite – weapons discharge. Even now, he felt the power of the Eva slipping from his fingers, as though he were being yanked out of the plug by invisible strings, drawing him out into the open with the Angel, forcing him to witness how insignificant he was against monsters that could control particles and wave matter on a whim.  
真嗣记得，在上一次出击时，他闻到了 EVA 生物层融合成热糊状物的气味，那种味道如何污染空气，带着火药味的刺鼻气息——武器发射的硝烟。即便此刻，他仍感觉到 EVA 的力量从指间滑落，仿佛被无形的线从插入栓中拽出，将他拖向天使所在的开阔地，迫使他目睹自己在能随意操控粒子与波动的怪物面前是多么渺小。

His mind stuck on that. The blades cut further into him. If not for the LCL, he would have had trouble breathing. Capacitors hummed and sputtered with fading power along the railgun's barrel. He leaned on the controls, focused his thought impulse, sight zeroing on Ramiel as though he were looking through binoculars. A thick, soupy smoke leaked into the air from its open wound, like oil spilling into water. Shinji commanded nearly heat-fused fingers open, dropping the railgun. A road-sized umbilical cable trailed behind Unit-01 as he moved it forward.  
他的思绪始终萦绕在那一点上。刀刃更深地切入他的身体。若非有 LCL，他恐怕早已呼吸困难。电容器沿着电磁炮的炮管发出微弱的嗡鸣和噼啪声，电力逐渐衰减。他倚靠在控制台上，集中思维脉冲，视线锁定拉米尔，仿佛透过望远镜凝视。一股浓稠的烟雾从其敞开的伤口中涌入空气中，宛如油滴入水。真嗣几乎被高温熔化的手指勉强张开，丢下了电磁炮。一条公路般粗的脐带拖在零号机后方，随着他的移动而前行。

_"Shinji, what are you doing?"_ Misato again. He had to grind his teeth to stop the trembling in his neck.  
“真嗣，你在做什么？”美里再次问道。他不得不咬紧牙关，以止住脖颈的颤抖。

_"Hold your position." “坚守阵地。”_

Heedless, Unit-01 lumbered through the battlefield, dry earth cracking under foot. Ramiel lay in a bed of ruined earthworks and bunkers built into the side of the mountains. Tiny motes of light glittered from slivers of its broken stem, their shards chittering meekly about its frame as it tried to cover its exposed core.  
不顾一切，初号机蹒跚地穿过战场，脚下干裂的土地发出脆响。雷米尔躺在一堆毁坏的土木工事和山腰上的掩体中。它破碎的茎干上闪烁着微小的光点，碎片在其框架周围怯懦地颤动，试图掩盖暴露的核心。

"_Unit-one, I gave you an order!"_  
初号机，我命令你！

Unit-01, responding to his commands, sank to a knee as its right hand crashed through Ramiel's weak barrier, breaking yet more bone to grasp its core. The thing fit into the behemoths hand – he could feel it shiver in his palm, could feel Ramiel bristle at the touch, bright rays trickling in dancing streaks towards the Eva. Voices from control brayed for him, but he couldn't hear them anymore as the Angel expanded its decay field. His heartbeat rolled in his ears, pulsing through his skull and making all else in his mind dark. Power flickered in the plug, cutting off his connection through the umbilical cable.  
初号机在他的指令下屈膝，右臂猛地穿透雷米尔脆弱的屏障，再次击碎骨骼以抓住其核心。那东西恰好嵌入巨人的手中——他能感觉到它在掌心颤抖，感受到雷米尔因触碰而竖起的刺芒，明亮的光线以舞动的条纹向 EVA 汇聚。指挥部的声音在呼喊他，但他的耳朵里只有心跳声，脉动穿过头骨，让他的思绪一片黑暗。插入栓内的电力闪烁，切断了脐带电缆的连接。

"_Shinj–!"_ "新条——！"

The BattleFreq went dead. Oxidation crept along what was left of his armor. At the very least, he could keep the implosion of the core contained with his A.T. field. But if he could crush it first…  
战斗通讯突然中断。氧化作用沿着他残存的装甲蔓延。至少，他可以用 A.T.力场控制住核心的内爆。但如果他能先将其粉碎……

He felt it, was so hungry for it he nearly smiled – a crack formed on the red sphere, a small one. Almost. He could sense it about to grind to dust between his fingers. _Almost_.  
他感受到了，如此渴望以至于几乎要微笑——红色球体上出现了一道裂缝，很小的一道。几乎。他能感觉到它即将在他的手指间化为尘埃。几乎。

There was a flash of light, pain ripping through him as Unit-01's shoulder burst from its socket.  
一道光芒闪过，剧痛撕裂着他，零一号机的肩膀从关节处爆裂开来。

After a 10 hour flight Asuka could finally see Japan, sprawling over the water and disappearing within a distant mist on the horizon. The wing of their black coated transport, designed to carry the obscene weight of an Evangelion, dipped as they arced over the mainland, waiting for clearance to land. It allowed her to see the wrinkled spread of green mountains and valleys, touched with pools of ocean that used to be towns or cities.  
经过 10 小时的飞行，明日香终于能看到日本了，它在水面上蔓延，消失在地平线远处的薄雾中。他们那架黑色涂装的运输机机翼下倾，这架设计用来承载福音战士惊人重量的飞机在大陆上空划出一道弧线，等待着降落许可。这让她得以看到那些布满皱纹的绿色山脉和山谷，点缀着曾经是城镇或城市的海湾。

The long series of islands were completely different from the old maps, but the speck she was looking for remained largely untouched. A smattering of silver and steel blue in a ring of calderas – craters created from ancient volcanic eruptions. From above, it looked like someone had frozen the impact of a raindrop hitting the water. In its cradle sat Tokyo-3.  
这一连串的岛屿与旧地图上的景象完全不同，但她寻找的那个小点基本上仍未受影响。在火山口环形山——由古代火山爆发形成的环形坑——中散布着银色和钢蓝色的斑点。从上方看，它就像有人冻结了一滴雨水落入水面的瞬间。在它的怀抱中坐落着东京-3。

"Are you nervous?" Kaji asked, slipping his cell phone away as he came to sit back down. A hand smoothed over his face and rubbed at his stubble, brows shooting up in anticipation.  
"你紧张吗？" 加持问道，一边将手机收起，一边重新坐下。他用手抚过脸颊，摩挲着胡茬，眉头因期待而扬起。

Asuka tried not to flare up and turned back to the window. "About what?" she snipped, with maybe more bite than was warranted for such an innocent question.  
明日香尽量不让自己发作，转回窗边。"关于什么？" 她尖锐地反问，语气中或许带了些过分的尖刻，对于这样一个无害的问题。

"Alright," Kaji sighed, holding up his hands in surrender. Asuka soured, but didn't want to turn around and face him again, hoping he might start talking about something else. But he didn't, only shifted in his seat and stayed quiet. He'd been like that since the night before they left Berlin, all brooding and moody and busy talking on his phone while she was left bored to tears. And now he thought she was so annoyed with him he wouldn't even talk to her. She wasn't annoyed at him, just...  
"好吧，" 加持叹了口气，举起双手表示投降。明日香心情变差，但不想转过身再次面对他，希望他或许会开始谈论其他事情。但他没有，只是挪了挪座位，保持沉默。自从他们离开柏林前一晚开始，他就一直是这样，阴沉而情绪化，忙着打电话，而她则无聊得要命。现在他以为她对他如此恼火，以至于连话都不想和他说。她并不是对他生气，只是...

Asuka shifted closer to the viewport, and let out a loud sigh-turned-grunt, trying to focus on the land below.  
明日香向舷窗挪近了一些，发出一声转为闷哼的叹息，试图专注于下方的大地。

It was somewhere she'd wanted to see since she was little, but could only stare through as they cruised along. The sight was overshadowed by clouds of thought drifting in. Kaji's persistent attempts to get her talking in that direction were – well, obnoxious. She wasn't stupid, far from it, and she knew what he was doing.  
这是她从小就想亲眼见见的地方，但只能透过窗户凝视着他们缓缓前行。眼前的景象被飘荡的思绪所掩盖。加持不断试图让她谈论那个方向的事情——嗯，真是烦人。她并不傻，远非如此，她知道他在做什么。

Why did he care so much anyway? Why would she feel nervous at all about coming to Tokyo-3? Certainly not because of some old friend. She'd been waiting to be deployed to Headquarters since their combat training was up. It'd taken them so long just to finish her Eva, which was humiliatingly enough the third one in production. Seeing her Unit-02, even malformed deep beneath Berlin, made her think it would be done before the others. But they'd started on it so late. It wasn't fair.  
他为什么这么在意呢？她为什么会因为来到第三新东京市而感到紧张？当然不是因为某个老朋友。自从他们的战斗训练结束后，她就一直在等待被派往总部。完成她的 Eva 花了这么长时间，这已经够丢脸的了，毕竟它是第三个开始生产的。看到她的二号机，即使是在柏林深处畸形地深藏，也让她觉得它会在其他机体之前完成。但他们开始得太晚了。这不公平。

With an inner sigh, Asuka took a moment to remind herself it was the production model. The design every other Eva in the series was based on now. Hers was purpose built for combat, not like the slapped together units made in Japan. A superior weapon for an ace pilot – and she _was_ an ace pilot. The clunky 3D simulations might have been goofy to look at and didn't capture the same heavy weight iron-on-your-brain feedback as the real thing, but her performance was top tier. So what if the war started without her? The Tokyo pilots might've been up on sorties and kills, but she'd have them beat out before the month was up. Especially that _boy_.  
带着内心的叹息，明日香稍作停顿，提醒自己这是量产机型。这个设计是系列中所有其他 Eva 的基础。她的 Eva 是为战斗量身定制的，不像日本匆忙拼凑的那些单位。这是一件给王牌飞行员使用的顶级武器——而她正是一位王牌飞行员。那些笨拙的 3D 模拟可能看起来滑稽，也无法捕捉到与真实 Eva 相同的沉重感，但她的表现却是顶尖的。就算战争开始时她不在场又如何？东京的飞行员们或许已经执行了多次任务并取得了击杀，但她会在月底前超越他们。尤其是那个男孩。

A wry smirk played at her lips. He might've been shipped off first, but she'd always been his better in sparring and their exercises, with exception to a few areas – which she had pursued doggedly to correct in the past year, pushing her operational limits in the plug.  
她嘴角露出一丝苦笑。他或许被先送走了，但她在训练和练习中总是比他更出色，除了少数几个领域——过去一年里她一直不懈地追求改进，在插入栓中不断挑战自己的操作极限。

Well, maybe that was embellishing. He'd flattened her out just as often, she could admit that. That was then, this was now. She was better. She had to be.  
嗯，也许这有点夸张。她承认，他也曾多次击败她。但那是过去，现在是现在。她更优秀。她必须如此。

Still, like the trickling streams and rivers coming down from Mount Fuji, her thoughts pattered to the estate back home, watering on memories she hadn't bothered to dwell upon in months. Maybe it was her nerves, or the fact she hadn't slept a wink on the flight and now the weary tug of fatigue was blanketing her further every moment. Either way, she slipped into a reverie, marveling at the swirling cistern of feeling it evoked in her.  
尽管如此，像富士山下潺潺流淌的小溪和河流，她的思绪涓涓细流般回到了家乡的庄园，滋润着那些她数月未曾深思的记忆。或许是她的紧张，或是她在飞行中彻夜未眠，现在疲惫的拉扯感每时每刻都在加重。无论如何，她陷入了一种遐想，惊叹于这情感漩涡在她心中唤起的波澜。

He'd never really left her mind to begin with, much as she entertained otherwise. After all, he was the reason she drove herself so recklessly to exhaustion during her training in his absence, which was maddening in and of itself.  
他从未真正离开过她的脑海，尽管她自欺欺人地试图否认。毕竟，正是因为他，她才会在他不在的时候如此疯狂地逼迫自己训练到筋疲力尽，这本身就够让人抓狂的了。

But that was always how their relationship had been.  
但他们的关系向来如此。

Asuka had been a little girl – alone, abandoned in her large garden and no one to share it with. Not that she was very good at sharing, but the flowers were all so many colors and the trees so tall and patient in the sun. She didn't need anyone there, nor did she really want anyone there. Not at the time. Even if she secretly ached for it.  
明日香曾是个小女孩——孤独地被遗弃在她那宽敞的花园中，无人与她共享这片天地。并非她不擅长分享，而是那些花朵色彩斑斓，树木在阳光下高大而耐心。她并不需要任何人陪伴，也不真正希望有人打扰。至少在当时是如此。尽管她内心深处暗暗渴望着。

It just would've been nice if someone else thought it was beautiful too.  
如果有人也觉得这里美丽，那该多好。

She remembered thinking that wasn't a thing she should have wanted. She was by her own. She didn't need others to make her feel less so. So she'd stayed in the house, away from the ferns and flowers from then on, wondering who the strange creature wandering her garden was. It was a boy of course, but boys turned into men and men were foreign, distant things that didn't have an interest in anything but themselves and grown women.  
她记得自己曾认为这不该是她所渴望的。她独自一人。她不需要他人来减轻这种孤独感。因此，从那时起她便待在屋内，远离蕨类植物和花朵，好奇地想知道在她的花园中徘徊的陌生生物是谁。当然，那是个男孩，但男孩会变成男人，而男人是陌生的、遥远的生物，只对自己和成年女性感兴趣。

So, one day, finally drawn into a fit, she had gone to look for the boy to tell him not to trample the flowers and to stay away from her roses. That was when she found the snake, scales of black so dark they shimmered blue in the right light. It had turned its head and looked at her, as though it knew her, then swayed off. She watched it slither and wiggle, so fluid and – though she had lacked a word for it then – graceful. It liked to climb itself into the trees, curling atop the lower branches and occasionally poking the air with its forked tongue.  
于是有一天，她终于忍不住爆发了，跑去找那个男孩，告诉他不要踩踏花朵，离她的玫瑰远点。就在那时，她发现了那条蛇，黑色的鳞片深邃到在适当的光线下泛着蓝光。它转过头来看着她，仿佛认识她，然后摇摆着离开了。她看着它滑行扭动，如此流畅——尽管当时她找不到合适的词来形容——优雅。它喜欢爬到树上，蜷缩在较低的树枝上，偶尔用分叉的舌头轻触空气。

She stared at it there, waiting for it to do something. It didn't talk or hiss or even bite, but merely sat in the shade content in its coil. So Asuka, in all her childish wisdom, climbed after it. The clever thing dashed over the branches and into the next tree, out of sight. That's when she realized the tree she'd chased it from held these greasy black balls. Papa had shown her these once. Olives.  
她盯着它，等待它有所动作。它既没有说话，也没有嘶嘶作声，甚至没有咬人，只是满足地盘踞在树荫下。于是，在所有孩子气的智慧驱使下，明日香跟着它爬上了树。那机灵的家伙迅速越过树枝，消失在另一棵树的视线之外。就在那时，她意识到她追逐它的那棵树上挂着这些油腻的黑球。爸爸曾经给她看过这些。橄榄。

They looked inviting enough and she ate amply, souring at the bitter taste. Yet they were nearly sweet, just as they went down her throat. It made her mouth tingle and water, so she ate more, and repeated this for the next few days. To the point where the burning dryness of the olives didn't bother her so much. On the third day, however, the boy came stumbling into the clearing, the viper she'd gotten to know so well making a quick getaway. Asuka was down amongst the roots 'round the other side. He hadn't noticed her yet and she watched while he ambled to the base of the tree and began to try and stifle quiet sobs.  
它们看起来足够诱人，她吃得饱饱的，对那苦涩的味道皱起了眉头。然而它们几乎带点甜味，刚滑过喉咙。这让她的嘴巴感到刺痛和流口水，于是她又吃了更多，接下来的几天里重复着这个过程。直到橄榄的灼热干燥不再那么困扰她。然而，在第三天，那个男孩跌跌撞撞地走进了空地，她熟悉的那条蝰蛇迅速逃走。明日香躲在另一边的树根旁。他还没注意到她，她看着他蹒跚走到树下，开始试图压抑低声的啜泣。

She hated that sound. What did a little boy have to cry about anyway? Asuka crept around the tree, still wary of him. She was going to make him stop crying.  
她讨厌那个声音。一个小男孩有什么好哭的呢？明日香悄悄绕过树，仍然对他保持警惕。她打算让他停止哭泣。

Asuka was jarred from the memory as they dove in on their final approach, soon landing with smooth precision at an airstrip in a port reserved strictly for NERV personnel. Various craft and carriers stamped with their insignia came and went with hive-like rapidity. Even this small hub dwarfed the third branch in Berlin, but one was a city-wide complex while the other was squished within a city district, hardly comparable.  
随着他们俯冲进入最后的进场阶段，明日香从回忆中惊醒，不久便以流畅的精准度降落在专供 NERV 人员使用的港口机场上。各种带有其徽章的飞行器和运输工具如蜂群般迅速往来。即便这个小型枢纽也远超柏林的第三分部，但一方是遍布全城的综合设施，另一方则局促于城市的一隅，实在难以相提并论。

"Well, well, so this is headquarters," Kaji said, leaning to peer out the window with her. "Pretty impressive, don't you think Asuka?"  
"哎呀，这就是总部啊，" 加持说着，侧身与她一同望向窗外。"相当壮观，你不觉得吗，明日香？"

"I suppose," she hummed. "算是吧，" 她轻哼一声。

"You suppose?" he asked with a bit of a laugh. "The entire city was built to accommodate NERV Headquarters. It's a veritable fortress."  
"你猜？" 他带着一丝笑意问道，"整个城市都是为了容纳 NERV 总部而建的。它简直就是一座坚不可摧的要塞。"

"I just wish it wasn't taking so long to get there."  
"我只是希望别再花这么长时间才到那儿。"

The transport rolled onto a wide plate and they were taken underground. The speed of descent could've competed with a sloth and Asuka had to keep forcing her fingers down from curling her hair, lest she rip the locks out. Everything was greasy now too and she felt completely gross. Really, she just wanted this entire trip to be over and done with.  
运输车驶上了一个宽阔的平台，他们被带入了地下。下降的速度慢得堪比树懒，明日香不得不一次次强压下手指，以免扯断自己的头发。四周的一切都变得油腻腻的，她感觉自己脏透了。真的，她只希望这段旅程能快点结束。

Their platform settled with a rattling _thoom_ into the base of a cavernous tunnel, made with the stark but raw efficiency of concrete and evenly spaced florescent lighting. On the other side of the bay people and machinery moved, almost microscopic in the plain expanse. Asuka scanned a bundle of figures waiting along the caution line, trying to decipher facial features.  
他们的平台在一阵嘎吱作响的轰鸣声中稳稳地停在了巨大隧道的底部，这隧道以混凝土的朴素和原始的高效构建，均匀分布的荧光灯照明。在海湾的另一侧，人和机械在广阔的空间中移动，几乎微小到难以辨认。明日香扫视着一群在警戒线旁等待的身影，试图辨认他们的面容。

"Ready?" “准备好了吗？”

Asuka flinched, but recovered, attempting to both stand and stretch at the same time. "Yep! Oh, I can't wait to take a shower!" she puffed out a breath and snatched her duffel bag from under the seat. Like the gentleman he was, Kaji held out his hand for it and she obliged. "First I want to see the GeoFront! Then you can take me on a tour of Tokyo-3, right Kaji?"  
明日香微微一颤，随即恢复镇定，试图同时站起来并伸展身体。“当然！哦，我迫不及待想洗个澡了！”她呼出一口气，从座位下抓起自己的行李袋。作为一位绅士，加持伸出手来接过，她便顺从地递给了他。“首先我想看看地底都市！然后你再带我游览第三新东京市，好吗，加持？”

Her guardian smiled. "We'll see Asuka. I have a lot to do with the transfer."  
她的监护人笑了。“我们会看到明日香的。关于转学，我有很多事情要处理。”

The tone was what struck her more than anything, the kind that had already decided _no_. She spun at the end of the lane. "Kaji! That isn't fair!"  
语气比任何事情都更让她印象深刻，那种已经决定不的语气。她在小巷尽头转身。“加持！这不公平！”

Right behind her, he stopped short, sputtering at first. "Weren't you just saying how you couldn't wait to get off the plane?"  
就在她身后，他突然停下，一开始有些结巴。“你刚才不是还说迫不及待想下飞机吗？”

"But you're changing our plans!" she cried, folding her arms.  
"但你这是在改变我们的计划！" 她喊道，双臂交叉抱在胸前。

He quirked an eyebrow, smile fading. "I told you I had to report in to the Commander first, now what's this about?"  
他挑了挑眉毛，笑容逐渐消失。"我告诉过你，我得先向指挥官汇报，现在这又是怎么回事？"

"It's about you not keeping your promises," she said, more frustrated now than she had been on the entire flight. She turned away from him, facing down the lane to the open hatchway leading outside. Muffled voices over the intercom flowed through the gap. All she wanted was to fly in, have her wonderful Unit-02 prepared in its launch bay and spend the rest of the day with Kaji who she'd barely seen the past week. So what if she–  
"这是关于你不守承诺的事，" 她现在比整个飞行过程中都要沮丧。她转身背对他，面向通向外部开放舱门的通道。对讲机里传来的模糊声音从缝隙中流淌出来。她所希望的不过是飞进来，让她的 Unit-02 在发射舱内准备就绪，然后与她过去一周几乎没见过的加持共度余下的时光。她——

"Asuka," Kaji's tone slapped her. "I don't know what's gotten into you, but–"  
"明日香," 加持的语气像是一记耳光。"我不知道你这是怎么了，但是——"

"_Nothing's_ wrong with me," she whined, trapped between an irate mentor and the light beyond the cabin. This was a nightmare and she hadn't even got off the plane yet.  
"我没什么不对劲的，" 她抱怨道，夹在愤怒的导师和机舱外的光明之间。这简直是场噩梦，而她甚至还没下飞机。

"I see," he said, softly this time. "Are you worried about meeting Shinji again?"  
"我明白了，" 他这次语气柔和了许多。"你是在担心再次见到真嗣吗？"

She made a high-noted scoff, tossing her hair aside as she turned about. "Who, that bellyaching beansprout? Why would I be? He was a loser when we were kids and he's probably still a loser now. So what?"  
她发出一声高调的嗤笑，甩开头发转身而去。“那个抱怨连连的小豆芽？我为什么要在意？他小时候就是个失败者，现在估计还是个失败者。那又怎样？”

One of his lopsided smiles returned. "But he's already had three sorties."  
他嘴角又浮现出一抹歪斜的微笑。“但他已经执行了三次任务。”

"That doesn't mean anything."  
“那说明不了什么。”

"And he has a median sync-ratio of seventy-two-point-three percent. Isn't that… ten points above yours?"  
"他的同步率是七十二点三，不是吗……比你高出十个百分点？"

"The sync-rate doesn't make the pilot," she snipped, tactfully and decisively ending the discussion there as she marched off the plane.  
"同步率并不能决定一个驾驶员，""她尖锐地说道，巧妙而果断地结束了这场讨论，随即走下了飞机。"

The tunnel seemed liable to swallow her whole now that she was setting foot in it. To the left were one of two railway tracks floor workers were readying to adopt the platform once the Eva was detached from the plane and anchored in place. Straight ahead, a short walk that took infinitely longer, were a handful of figures she didn't recognize and two that she did.  
隧道现在似乎随时可能将她完全吞没。左边是两条铁轨之一，地勤人员正准备在 Eva 从飞机上分离并固定到位后使用这个平台。直走过去，虽然只是一小段路，却仿佛走了无穷无尽的时间，她看到了几个不认识的身影和两个熟悉的面孔。

At Misato's side, almost behind her, was Shinji dressed in the standard tan NERV uniform, except he was the only one she could ever recall standing out in it. Maybe that was just because he was a familiar sight, aside from the way it broadened his shoulders and made him appear more rigid and sharp. How easily he occupied it, even with one arm hanging in a sling. Asuka knew they were both only 14 – well, she was 13 – but Shinji looked much older. So much more grown up than she'd ever given thought to. She must've looked that way too, having filled into A cups and wearing a new curve in her hips.  
在美里身边，几乎站在她身后的是穿着标准棕褐色 NERV 制服的真嗣，只是他是她唯一记得穿着它显得与众不同的人。也许这只是因为他是个熟悉的身影，除了那件衣服让他的肩膀显得更宽阔，使他看起来更加刚硬和锐利。即便一只手臂挂在吊带里，他也能轻松驾驭这套制服。明日香知道他们俩都只有 14 岁——好吧，她是 13 岁——但真嗣看起来成熟得多。比她曾经考虑过的要成熟得多。她一定也看起来那样，已经发育到 A 罩杯，臀部也穿出了新的曲线。

As they got closer, Kaji spread his free arm out. "Ah, if it isn't the beautiful and illustrious Misato Katsuragi! _What_ a welcoming committee!"  
当他们走近时，加持张开他空着的那只手臂。"啊，这不是美丽而杰出的葛城美里吗！多么热情的欢迎队伍啊！"

Misato crossed her arms. "Well, if it isn't a walking scumbag."  
美里交叉双臂。"哼，这不是个行走的混蛋吗。"

"Oh, come now, isn't that a bit of a harsh greeting?"  
"哦，得了吧，这样的问候是不是有点太严厉了？"

"Not for you," she said, glaring.  
"对你来说不算什么，"她瞪眼说道。

Kaji gave a mock pout and smug smile. "Ouch."  
加持装出一副委屈的样子，脸上却带着得意的笑容。"真狠。"

Misato's lips twisted in a "sorry, not sorry' kind of smile. As she set her attention on Asuka, her demeanor changed instantly and she beamed. "Hey, long time no see kiddo! Gosh, you've grown some since I last saw you."  
美里嘴角勾起一抹‘抱歉，但并不真的抱歉’的微笑。当她将注意力转向明日香时，态度立刻转变，笑容满面。“嘿，好久不见，小家伙！天哪，自从上次见面以来，你又长高了不少。”

Asuka let out a small laugh, standing straighter and holding her hands behind her back. "Well of course, Misato! After all, you remember my figure started filling out before most other girls."  
明日香轻笑一声，站得更直，双手背在身后。“当然啦，美里！毕竟，你记得我的身材比其他女孩更早开始发育。”

The woman offered a smile. "If you say so," she said, stepping aside. "By the way, I figured I'd bring someone along to meet you." she put her hand on Shinji's back and gave him a nudge. Though his mouth twitched with a grimace, he ignored her and took a step forward.  
女人露出微笑。“你这么说的话，”她说着，侧身让开。“对了，我想带个人来见你。”她把手放在真嗣背上，轻轻推了他一下。尽管他嘴角抽搐，面露难色，但还是无视了她，向前迈了一步。

Her lungs swelled and prickled as though shards of needle had burst in her chest. The mere pressure made her want to slap him in his whole face. What would he say? She couldn't tell at all. Knowing him something grossly plain and obvious. No, she couldn't tell. What would she do if he insulted her? Everything in her mind told her she wanted him to so she could bite back, that little jerk. _Go ahead Shinji, say something_.  
她的肺部膨胀，刺痛不已，仿佛胸腔内爆裂了无数针尖。仅仅是这种压力就让她想扇他整张脸。他会说什么？她完全猜不到。了解他，只会是些粗俗直白的话。不，她猜不到。如果他侮辱她，她该怎么办？她脑海中的一切都在告诉她，她希望他这么做，这样她就可以反咬一口，那个小混蛋。来吧，真嗣，说点什么。

"Hey," he said. “嘿，”他说。

Asuka's hands moved to her hips as the knot in her core unraveled, heart beat no less rapid. She took her time looking him up and down, settling her expression on unimpressed. "What happened to you, Third Child? Angels too much for you?" she sneered. What flashed through his eyes stabbed her, though she didn't let it show. It only stoked the white hot furnace glowing under her skin.  
明日香双手叉腰，内心的纠结逐渐解开，心跳依旧急促。她不紧不慢地上下打量着他，脸上摆出一副不以为然的神情。“你怎么了，第三少年？天使们让你招架不住了？”她嘲讽道。他眼中的闪光刺痛了她，尽管她没有表现出来。这只会点燃她皮肤下炽热的熔炉。

Asuka took two steps forward, right in his face. That'd show him. "What? Got something to say to me?"  
明日香向前迈了两步，直逼到他面前。这下他该明白了吧。“怎么？有话要对我说吗？”

His pupils burned. Misato stepped halfway between them. "Woah, cool it," she said, expression somewhere between concern and bewilderment. "What's wrong with you two? I thought you'd be happy to see each other again."  
他的瞳孔中燃烧着怒火。美里跨步站在他们中间。“哇，冷静点，”她说，表情介于关切与困惑之间。“你们俩怎么了？我还以为你们重逢会很高兴呢。”

"We're not little kids anymore," Shinji muttered.  
“我们不再是小孩子了，”真嗣低声嘟囔道。

That little brat. So what if his score was ten points higher than hers? If he thought–  
那个小鬼。就算他的分数比她高十分又怎样？如果他以为——

Klaxons shattered the air, drawing everyone tense. "_All personnel to level one battle stations. All personnel to level one battle stations. Pattern Blue detected on an attack vector. Evangelion pilots prepare for immediate launch._"  
警报声划破空气，令所有人紧张起来。"所有人员进入一级战斗岗位。所有人员进入一级战斗岗位。发现攻击向量上的蓝色模式。EVA 驾驶员准备立即出击。"

In a flash, Misato was in soldier mode and for a second Asuka felt as though she were in training again. "Alright, we're cutting this short. Asuka, you're coming with us to the cages." She and their entourage marched off to a row of parked motorized carts. The tech with them slipped into the drivers seat and they hopped into the remaining spaces.  
一瞬间，美里进入了战士模式，让明日香感觉仿佛回到了训练中。"好了，我们得缩短时间。明日香，你跟我们一起去笼子。"她和他们的随行人员快步走向一排停放的电动小车。技术人员坐进驾驶座，他们则跳进了剩下的座位。

"What about Unit-two?" Asuka asked, letting her tone slip. Shinji had taken the seat up front with Misato and the tech, while she was relegated to the back. _Jerkwad_.  
"二号机怎么办？" 明日香问道，语气中流露出一丝不满。真嗣坐在前排和美里以及技术人员一起，而她却被安排在后排。讨厌鬼。

"They'll get it there, but we're going to have to delay a combat launch. Which means you two will be deploying inside the defense perimeter. _Damn,_" she cursed through her teeth, slipping a comm piece into an ear. As she did so, Kaji approached.  
"他们会把它运到那里，但我们不得不推迟一次战斗发射。这意味着你们两个将在防御圈内部署。该死，"她咬牙切齿地咒骂着，将通讯器塞进耳朵。就在这时，加持走了过来。

"Um, what about me?" he said, and Asuka took in the only four occupied seats.  
"呃，那我呢？" 他问道，明日香环顾四周，只有四个座位被占据。

Misato made a show of doing the same. "Huh, guess you'll be walking," she said, giving him a wink.  
美里也装模作样地跟着做。“哼，看来你得自己走了，”她说着，朝他眨了眨眼。

"Or you could... sit in my lap. Like old times."  
“或者你可以……坐在我腿上。就像以前那样。”

"_Excuse me?!_" “你说什么？！”

Asuka just about burst, until Kaji held up a forestalling hand. "It's alright," he said, handing her carry on back, "I'll see you after the battle. Good luck!"  
明日香几乎要爆发，直到加持举起一只手示意她稍安勿躁。“没事的，”他说着，将她的行李递回，“战斗结束后再见。祝你好运！”

Then they were off, zipping through increasingly smaller personnel tunnels that, as they went further, lost the clean order of the hangars. Miles of wire and pipelines followed them along curved walls. Every so often, she glanced at Shinji, but he wasn't looking at her. He was staring hard at their destination ahead, and she could practically see the walls building in his mind. He would do that whenever they used to spar. Just get this look that told her he was calculating – honing in. Determined.  
随后他们便出发了，穿梭在越来越狭窄的人员通道中，随着深入，通道失去了机库的整洁秩序。数英里的电线和管道沿着弯曲的墙壁跟随他们。她不时瞥向真嗣，但他并未看她。他紧盯着前方的目的地，她几乎能看见他在脑海中构建的墙壁。每当他们过去对练时，他就会露出这种表情，告诉她他在计算——专注。坚定不移。

She recalled a sort of sharpness dancing over her skin whenever she noticed it, like she were excited. This time however, she saw there was a hollowness that occupied it, and a black, poisonous bitterness crawled over her instead.  
她记得每当注意到这一点时，皮肤上总会掠过一种锐利的感觉，仿佛兴奋不已。然而这次，她察觉到其中空洞无物，取而代之的是一种黑色、有毒的苦涩在心头蔓延。

They reached the Evangelion cages in short order and Asuka wasn't directed to the changing room so much as she tagged behind Shinji as he navigated the corridors. Misato left them for the command center. A mere curtain separated the boys and girls sections of the lockers and they both changed in terse stillness.  
他们很快到达了 EVA 笼区，Asuka 并没有被引导到更衣室，而是跟在 Shinji 身后穿梭于走廊。Misato 离开他们前往指挥中心。仅有一道帘子隔开了男女更衣区，两人在沉默中迅速更换衣物。

Out in the cages, she waited along one of the Eva restraining walls, watching as Unit-02 was carefully marionetted into an upright position. There was no sign of the First Child and her unit cage was obscured. Where could she be?  
在笼区外，她靠在一堵 EVA 束缚墙上等待，看着 Unit-02 被小心翼翼地操纵成直立姿势。第一适格者和她 EVA 的笼区被遮挡，不见踪影。她会在哪里呢？

The sight of Shinji cut her speculation short. She noticed him right away, making for the cage designated Unit-01, maybe twenty feet from where she leaned along the wall. At the gateway – a small opening in the massive steel cable shutters – he stopped, right arm pressed to his stomach while his free hand clutched at a support railing. Asuka could see the color had drained some from his face, giving him a sickly white pallor that made the black rings around his eyes more visible.  
Shinji 的出现打断了她的猜测。她立刻注意到他，正朝着指定给 Unit-01 的笼区走去，距离她倚靠的墙壁大约二十英尺。在巨大的钢缆卷帘门下的小入口处，他停了下来，右臂紧贴腹部，空着的手紧抓着扶手。Asuka 可以看到他的脸色苍白，病态的白色让眼周的黑圈更加明显。

As though sensing her, he shifted and caught her stare. The change was cutting, his weariness tucked away as he turned to march up the steps to the insertion platform.  
仿佛感应到她的目光，他动了动，捕捉到了她的凝视。变化是如此突兀，他的疲惫被隐藏起来，转身迈步走向插入平台的台阶。

She tracked him every step of the way, brow knit, jaw tight. "I won't let you beat me," she growled. Not on her first sortie in Japan. Not to Mister Ten Points Higher. Numbness wound her stomach like someone had dropped a bowling ball on it. "I _won't_."  
她一路紧盯着他，眉头紧锁，下巴紧绷。“我不会让你打败我，”她低吼道。不是在日本的首战，也不是对那位总是高她十分的先生。麻木感如同一颗保龄球砸在她的胃里，缠绕不去。“我不会。”

After an agonizing wait that drew an ache in her joints for action, Unit-02 was finally ready. She bolted up the grated stairway to her entry plug, as if in a race. Once sealed in, she was drowned in LCL while the techs whisked through activation and pre-launch checklists. Internal mechanisms rumbled through the Eva's feet and to her own as Unit-02 was taken to the launch pads alongside Unit-01.  
在漫长而痛苦的等待中，她的关节因渴望行动而隐隐作痛，二号机终于准备就绪。她如竞赛般冲上格栅楼梯，进入插入栓。一旦密封其中，她便被 LCL 淹没，技术人员迅速进行激活和发射前检查。内部机械的轰鸣声通过 Eva 的脚传到她身上，二号机与初号机并排被送往发射台。

Windows of both Misato and Shinji appeared on her left. "_Alright you two,_" the Captain said, "_Our defense grid is still under repair from the last battle, so you won't have much in the way of protective fire barriers for this deployment._ _The Magi have little to nothing on the target either – that means we don't know anything concrete about its offensive or defensive capabilities._"  
美里和真嗣的窗口出现在她的左侧。“好了，你们两个，”队长说道，“我们的防御网在上次战斗中受损，仍在修复中，所以这次部署你们不会有太多防护火力屏障。MAGI 对目标的信息也几乎为零——这意味着我们对它的攻防能力一无所知。”

Shinji mouthed something under his breath. Whatever was said, Misato ignored it. They were decidedly not interested in acknowledging one another.  
真嗣低声嘀咕了些什么。无论他说了什么，美里都置若罔闻。他们显然不打算互相理睬。

Beside Unit-02's left leg, a massive warehouse crane gliding along the cieling locked a pallet rifle in place on her launch harness. "I can kill the Angel myself," she said, "I don't need backup."  
在二号机左侧，一台巨大的仓库起重机沿着天花板滑行，将一箱步枪固定在她的发射装置上。“我可以独自击杀使徒，”她说，“我不需要支援。”

"_We don't take unnecessary risks like that, Asuka. I want coordinated attacks, understand? Prepare for launch."_  
"我们不会采取那种不必要的冒险，明日香。我要的是协调攻击，明白吗？准备发射。"

Both their panels winked out. Asuka hunched forward, grip tightening around the induction levers. A countdown appeared on her right, ticking down in sync with the operator's voice over the comms. An alarm screamed and the counter flashed green.  
两人的面板同时熄灭。明日香身体前倾，握紧感应操纵杆。倒计时出现在她的右侧，与通讯中操作员的语音同步倒数。警报声响起，计数器闪烁着绿色。

Beneath her a ripple shuddered through the launch pad and the lights above shivered with power fluctuations. A low, whining alarm triggered and metal screeched from jamming mechanisms.  
在她下方，发射台颤动着，上方的灯光因电力波动而闪烁。低沉的警报声响起，金属因卡住机制而发出刺耳声。

Misato cut over the channel. "_What's happening?"_  
美里切断了通讯频道。“发生了什么？”

_"Emergency disconnect. The launch pad circuits aren't getting enough power and I'm reading damage in the ignition system. The Magi are also reporting outages in several subsections of the base."  
“紧急断开连接。发射台电路电力不足，点火系统受损。MAGI 也报告基地多个子区域出现断电。”_

_"How are we losing power? What about the back up generators?"  
“我们怎么会失去电力？备用发电机呢？”_

_"Our grid took a beating from powering the railgun last sortie and we've only completed forty-eight percent of overall repairs. The generators can't allocate power if the lines are damaged."  
“我们的电网在上次出动为轨道炮供电时受损严重，目前整体修复进度仅完成百分之四十八。如果线路损坏，发电机无法分配电力。”_

_"Are we able to isolate the affected areas supplying the cages?"  
“我们能隔离受影响的区域为笼子供电吗？”_

Another man's voice interjected. _"We can, but repairs could take hours depending on the extent of damage..."_  
另一个男人的声音插话道：“我们可以，但修复时间可能需要数小时，具体取决于损坏程度……”

_"Didn't the catapults pass testing phases two days ago?"  
"两天前不是已经通过了弩炮的测试阶段吗？"_

_"Individual, not simultaneous launches. It looks like consumption demands put more stress on the circuits than we thought. They'll have to be gutted again."  
"是单独发射，不是同时。看来消耗需求对电路的压力比我们预想的要大。它们得再次被彻底检修。"_

Misato made an aggrieved sigh_. "Have engineering put this on priority, and tell them to do it right this time. We're not getting the Evas topside this way, not today."_  
美里发出一声无奈的叹息。“让工程部优先处理这个，并告诉他们这次要彻底解决。我们这样是没法把 EVA 送上地面的，今天不行。”

A pause stretched the frequency as the woman considered other options. So did Asuka. Maybe they could be airlifted out? She was sure they had shafts in the armored shutters for that. But she doubted there was a VTOL strong enough to get an Eva through. Only the bomber transports could do that, and those needed a lift to reach the mountain hangars anyway.  
一阵沉默拉长了频率，女子在考虑其他方案。明日香也在思考。或许他们可以被空运出去？她确信装甲百叶窗上有通风口可以利用。但她怀疑是否有足够强大的垂直起降飞机能运送 Eva。只有轰炸运输机才能做到这一点，而且那些飞机也需要提升才能到达山中机库。

"I don't need to fight the Angel on the surface," she said, "let it come to the GeoFront."  
“我不需要在地面与使徒战斗，”她说，“让它进入地下来。”

An automated voice spoke over the loudspeakers, amplified in the echo of the launch bay. _"Target has breached the Shiroyama defense line."_  
一个自动化的声音通过扬声器在发射舱的回声中放大。“目标已突破白山防线。”

Asuka smiled. 明日香微笑了。

_"No,"_ Misato said, _"you're going to use the shafts to climb to the surface. Our defensive capabilities are null down here. We have to engage the Angel at the intercept zone. The Magi are mapping out your route now, so follow their markers and arm at the nearest munitions depot. Get moving."_  
“不，”美里说，“你们要利用竖井爬到地面上。我们在这里的防御能力为零。必须在拦截区与使徒交战。MAGI 正在规划你们的路线，跟着它们的标记走，并在最近的军火库武装起来。快行动。”

---

Both Eva's took their rifles and fastened them to the magnetic plates on their thigh armor. Machinery crashed as the war machines began to climb their separate shafts.  
两台 EVA 拿起步枪，将其固定在大腿装甲的磁性板上。随着战争机器开始攀爬各自的竖井，机械碰撞声此起彼伏。

Asuka didn't know if she was thankful or not for the red emergency lights casting the long tunnel in crimson. At least she could see where she was sticking Unit-02's hands. Being up at such an angle had gravity putting just enough weight on her to be noticeable. LCL cushioning compensated for the rest.  
明日香不知道自己是否应该感谢那些红色应急灯，它们将长长的隧道映成了深红色。至少她能看清自己在用二号机的手往哪里插。以这样的角度上升，重力使得她的体重刚好增加到可以察觉的程度。LCL 缓冲液弥补了其余的部分。

Lining the center of the launch shaft between the electromagnetic rails were ribbed support sections, which she was sure the Eva was doing awful damage to each climb she made. At this point, it didn't matter much to her. She had a job to do. Radio chatter was kept to a minimum, at least on the BattleFreq, making her ache for something. Conversation, voices, action. Anything but the long dark.  
发射井中央的电磁轨道之间排列着带肋的支撑部分，她确信每次攀爬，Eva 都会对这些结构造成严重的破坏。但到了这个地步，对她来说已经不太重要了。她有任务要完成。无线电通讯保持在最低限度，至少在战斗频率上是如此，这让她渴望听到些什么。对话、声音、行动。什么都比这漫长的黑暗要好。

"This is so stupid," she said, frowning. Unit-02's hand slipped and she pulled back on the induction levels, the associated impulse shooting the Eva's hand out to catch itself. "What kind of command center can't launch its own Evas?"  
“这太蠢了，”她皱着眉说。二号机的手滑了一下，她立刻调整感应水平，随之而来的冲力让 Eva 的手伸出去抓住了支撑。“什么样的指挥中心连自己的 Eva 都发射不了？”

"_The target has passed the Daikanzan defense point._"  
"目标已通过大看山防御点。"

_"Asuka, cut the chatter and keep moving."  
"明日香，别闲聊了，继续前进。"_

"I haven't _stopped_ moving," she snapped, muttering bitter comforts in her native language. The echoing stillness of the black maw seemed to grow louder, even over the whirring of the Eva's hydraulics. Despite the holo-map sitting next to her head, it felt like she was lost.  
"我一直在动，"她厉声说道，用母语低声抱怨着。黑暗深渊的回响似乎越发响亮，甚至盖过了 Eva 液压系统的嗡嗡声。尽管全息地图就在她头旁，她却感觉自己迷失了方向。"

Asuka had never felt claustrophobic in the plug before. The place had always been welcoming to her, like being wrapped in a warm flannel blanket during the winter months back home, dark and comforting. There wasn't a sense of the cold, lifeless metal that enclosed her now, making her blind, deaf and dumb to the world below and above her. She was nowhere, stuck inbetween with no clear direction but up to fight where the enemy was. Somewhere out there was Shinji, finding his way just like her. Except she couldn't see him either. He was lost too, even though the little marker on her Plug-HUD told her exactly where he was. There was no face or name.  
明日香以前从未在插入栓里感到过幽闭恐惧。这个地方对她来说总是像冬日里裹在温暖的法兰绒毯子里一样，黑暗而舒适。现在，她感觉不到那种冰冷、无生命的金属包围着她，让她对上下世界都变得盲目、聋哑。她无处可去，卡在中间，没有明确的方向，只能向上战斗，那是敌人的所在。在某处，真嗣也在寻找出路，就像她一样。只是她也看不见他。他也迷失了，尽管她插入栓的 HUD 上的小标记准确地告诉她他在哪里。没有面孔，没有名字。

_"The Angel has stopped over Mount Hakone and is currently holding position._ _Point defense systems have had no effect._ _No spikes in activity detected."_  
“使徒已停留在箱根山上空并保持位置。点防御系统未产生效果。未检测到活动激增。”

_"Is it preparing an attack?"  
“它是在准备攻击吗？”_

_"All of our sensors are reporting threshold readings, no abnormalities."  
"我们所有的传感器都显示正常读数，没有异常。"_

_"Does it know we're coming?"_ Misato said, more in a whisper than addressing anyone.  
"它知道我们要来吗？" 美里说道，与其说是对某人说话，更像是在自言自语。"

Asuka redoubled her efforts, determined to reach the Angel before Shinji. Meters-to-target beside Unit-01's marker began to drop faster. He was thinking the same thing.  
明日香加倍努力，决心赶在真嗣之前到达使徒那里。零一机旁的距离指示开始更快地下降。他也在想着同样的事情。

"Come on, Asuka," she said, low enough it wouldn't be picked up on the Freq. The launch tunnel came to an intersection, one half splitting off horizontal and allowing her to crawl, transitioning the pressure of gravity from pushing on her chest to weighing on her back instead. Once she reached the edge of the GeoFront the route split off again and she mounted the vertical shaft to begin climbing. Glancing at the holo-map again, Shinji was a hair's breadth away from topside, while she still had a few hundred meters to go. Asuka picked up the pace, heat burning over her forehead.  
"快点，明日香，"她低声说道，声音低到不会被频率捕捉到。发射隧道到了一个交叉口，一半水平分叉，让她可以爬行，将重力从压在胸前转变为压在背上。一旦她到达地表边缘，路线再次分叉，她便开始攀爬垂直井。再次瞥了一眼全息地图，真嗣距离地面只有一步之遥，而她还有几百米要走。明日香加快了步伐，额头上的热度燃烧着。

Comms came alive again. _"Shinji, wait for Unit-two before launching your assault on the Angel."_  
通讯再次活跃起来。"真嗣，在二号机到达前不要对使徒发起攻击。"

_"Roger,"_ he said, as dull and tired as before.  
"收到，"他回答道，一如既往地沉闷和疲惫。

_"Unit-one has armed its ACR combat rifle."  
一号单元已装备 ACR 战斗步枪。_

The tension over the BattleFreq jumped. _"Shinji, obey my orders!"_ Misato hollered.  
战斗频率上的紧张气氛骤增。“真嗣，服从我的命令！”美里大声喊道。

A pause bled over the line. Then, someone from command. _"Contact!"_  
线路中出现了一阵沉默。随后，指挥部的某人喊道：“接触了！”

A growl reached her. _"That idiot."_  
一声低吼传入她耳中。“那个白痴。”

Asuka thought something along the same lines, face pinched as she willed her Eva faster. The walls trembled under Unit-02's fingers. She couldn't lose the battle, not to him. She _couldn't_ be seen as incompetent on her first sortie, damn him. Not now. Unit-02's knee railed against something protruding from the wall, shearing as it caught on the Eva's armor. Whatever she tore loose crashed into her pallet rifle, knocking it free of the magnetic plates.  
明日香也有同感，她紧皱着脸，催动她的 Eva 加速前进。墙壁在二号机的手指下颤抖。她不能在这场战斗中输给他，不能在第一次出击时显得无能，该死的。不是现在。二号机的膝盖撞上了从墙里伸出的东西，被 Eva 的装甲卡住并切断。她扯下的任何东西都砸在了她的弹药箱步枪上，使其脱离了磁力板。

The weapon fell into the abyss. "_Verdammt_!"  
武器坠入了深渊。“该死！”

_"It's okay Asuka,"_ Misato said, forcing calm into her voice, _"you can get another one topside."_  
"没事的，明日香，" 美里说道，努力让自己的声音保持平静，"你可以在地面上再找一个。"

Impacts continued to vibrate down to her, until finally she reached the surface hatch, which parted as she approached. A world of super-sonic cracks and screaming bangs.  
冲击波继续沿着通道传到她这里，直到她终于到达了地表的舱门，舱门在她靠近时分开。一个充满超音速裂响和尖叫轰鸣的世界。

Her heart thundered. 她的心跳如雷。

_"The Magi are marking re-arm points on your displays now,"_ Misato said as she hauled Unit-02 out onto the streets. As promised a small network of blue-tinged markers sprang up across the landscape of her Plug-HUD. She glanced over the locations and then dismissed them – a once over was enough, she'd be forcing herself to process too much information otherwise.  
“现在贤者们正在你的显示屏上标记重新武装点，”美里一边说着，一边将 2 号机拖到街道上。正如所承诺的，一片泛着蓝光的标记点在她的插入栓 HUD 上涌现。她快速扫了一眼这些位置，然后将其忽略——一次粗略的浏览已足够，否则她将被迫处理过多信息。

The Angel was across Lake Ashi by the sulfur mounds of Mount Hakone. There was a low rumbling that preceded it, like the hum of her Eva's internal engines resonating through the plug. A sound that rose with the blazing orange form of the Angel, as though the Earth had inherited a second sun, but cut with sharp, smooth faces like a gem. Straight lines of varying intensity etched its surface at a downward slant, giving an unsettling sense of sentience with each trickling glow spearing down their length.  
使徒位于芦之湖对岸，靠近箱根山的硫磺堆。在它出现之前，有一种低沉的隆隆声，就像她的 EVA 内部引擎通过插入栓传来的共鸣。随着使徒那炽烈的橙色身影升起，这声音也随之增强，仿佛地球上多了一个太阳，但被切割成锐利、平滑的表面，宛如宝石。不同强度的直线在其表面以向下倾斜的角度刻画，每道流动的光芒沿着这些线条滑落，给人一种不安的智能感。

How it hovered over the air, Asuka couldn't say, but she didn't really care. Unit-02's targeting system began tracking the thing, naming it Gaghiel. It ascended steadily, unhurried and though it was odd to think, with purpose.  
明日香无法解释它是如何悬浮在空中的，但她并不真正在意。2 号机的瞄准系统开始追踪这个生物，并将其命名为 Gaghiel。它稳步上升，不慌不忙，尽管这想法有些奇怪，但它显然有着明确的目的。

To her left crouched Unit-01, roughly seventeen city blocks away and using the buildings for cover. Flares winked from the points of light in the Angel's etching, razor thin particle beams glittering in the air before blossoming in pink explosions that ate away at Unit-01's cover. The Eva staggered, something rupturing on its back.  
在她左侧，初号机蜷缩着，大约距离十七个街区，利用建筑物作为掩护。天使身上的光点闪烁着，发出细如刀刃的粒子束，在空中闪耀后绽放成粉红色的爆炸，逐渐侵蚀着初号机的掩体。EVA 摇晃着，背部似乎有什么破裂了。

_"Unit-one's umbilical cable has been cut!"  
“初号机的脐带电缆被切断了！”_

Asuka moved Unit-02 towards the nearest weapons cache. ""Just expand your field! I got this." No sooner had she said it than Shinji's Eva lumbered out of cover, closing within five miles of the Angel.  
明日香操控二号机向最近的武器库移动。“只要扩大你的力场！我能搞定。”她话音刚落，真嗣的 EVA 便蹒跚着走出掩体，逼近到天使五英里之内。

"Hey!" "嘿！"

Particle streams winked again from the Angel and clusters of energy burst through asphalt to meet the charging Eva. Asuka lost sight of Unit-01 as the tide of ripping blasts plowed towards her in a jagged line. Pure, luminous white light blinded her, the impacts swallowing her skin in a wash of heat. Shock-waves shook the plug and the lights snapped red, warnings flaring on either side of her. _Power Supply Disconnect. Power Supply Disconnect._  
粒子流再次从使徒身上闪烁，能量团穿透沥青路面迎向冲锋的 Eva。随着撕裂的爆炸浪潮以锯齿状线条向她袭来，明日香失去了对 01 机的视线。纯粹、耀眼的白光使她目眩，冲击波吞噬着她的皮肤，带来一阵热浪。冲击波震动着插入栓，灯光转为红色，警告在她两侧闪烁。电源断开。电源断开。

_"Unit-two has switched to internal power!"_ A counter replaced the warnings as the operator said it.  
"二号机已切换至内部电源！" 操作员说完，警告被计数器取代。

Asuka cursed. The thought to find another cable port crossed her mind. But she had to get in the fight. Asuka turned to grab her rifle, only to find the folding panel mangled and fused shut. A glance at her battery timer. 04:36. She repositioned Unit-02, wedging its fingers into a gap in the panel.  
明日香咒骂了一声。她脑海中闪过寻找另一个数据端口的想法。但她必须加入战斗。明日香转身去抓她的步枪，却发现折叠面板被扭曲并熔合封闭了。她瞥了一眼电池计时器。04:36。她重新调整了二号机的位置，将手指插入面板的缝隙中。

Unit-01 had found cover again, drawing its rifle closer as glass and aluminum shattered overhead. Then it spun from cover, unleashing a tide of depleted uranium at the thing called Gaghiel, empty shells the size of cars crashing at its feet. The rounds arced into the Angel and it responded in kind. Fire consumed the ground about Unit-01, scouring the armor as it fought the Eva's A.T. Field.  
初号机再次找到了掩护，将步枪拉近身边，头顶的玻璃和铝材碎片四溅。随后它从掩体中旋转而出，向被称为迦基尔的使徒倾泻了一波波贫铀弹，汽车大小的空弹壳在其脚下轰然坠落。这些子弹弧线射入使徒体内，使徒也以同样的方式回应。火焰吞噬了初号机周围的土地，烧蚀着装甲，同时与 EVA 的 A.T.力场抗衡。

As Shinji spent his last round, the building on Unit-01's right opened to reveal the long shaft of a prog-spear. Dropping his rifle, Shinji took it in the Eva's right hand, side stepping through smoke and heat to an open thoroughfare.  
当真嗣打完最后一发子弹时，初号机右侧的建筑物打开，露出一根长长的推进矛。真嗣丢下步枪，用 EVA 的右手握住它，穿过烟雾和热浪，来到一条开阔的大道上。

Unit-01 hefted the spear over a shoulder and, with one powerful step, hurled it at Gaghiel.  
初号机将长矛举过肩头，随后猛地一踏，向加吉尔投掷出去。

Flames licked the air around the Angel, accompanied by the sound of screeching glass. An A.T. field shrieked and the next moment Unit-01's spear was buried blade first through a building behind her. If it's trajectory had been just a few degrees to the right...  
火焰在天使周围舔舐着空气，伴随着玻璃碎裂的尖锐声响。A.T.力场尖啸着，下一刻初号机的长矛便刀锋朝下贯穿了天使身后的一栋建筑。如果它的轨迹再向右偏几度...

Metal groaned and Unit-02 stumbled back as she ripped the steel panel from its holdings. Snatching the pallet rifle up, Asuka turned and opened fire. Led pulsed in her throat. She hadn't let the targeter align, not that she could see the Angel very well due to the growing clouds of battle billowing over the valley. A handful of the rounds arced under its silhouette, throwing fountains of earth in the air as they struck the mountains. Several hit home, impacting with bursts of smoke and fire.  
金属发出呻吟，二号机踉跄后退，同时从固定处撕下钢板。明日香抓起托盘步枪，转身开火。铅弹在她喉咙中跳动。她没有让瞄准器对准目标，更何况由于战场上空不断升起的烟尘，她根本看不清天使。几发子弹在它的轮廓下划出弧线，击中山体时扬起阵阵尘土。几发命中目标，撞击处爆发出烟雾和火焰。

As the fog dispersed, she saw the Angel's surface was unscathed. Gaghiel had changed shape altogether. From its compact form had blossomed something predatory and bird-like, its wings composed of bright orange shards that burned like hot irons. At the center of it hovered a red sphere, guarded jealousy by shards that dipped to a razor thin point resembling a beak. The thing had no eyes, but there was a subtle malice in the spread of its wings.  
雾气散去，她看到天使的表面毫发无损。Gaghiel 已经完全改变了形态。从原本紧凑的身躯中绽放出一种捕食性的、鸟类般的生物，其翅膀由明亮的橙色碎片组成，犹如炽热的铁块般燃烧。在其中心悬浮着一个红色球体，被尖锐如喙的碎片紧紧守护着。这生物没有眼睛，但其翅膀的展开却隐含着一丝狡诈的恶意。

When it moved, neither of them were ready.  
当它行动时，他们俩都未曾准备好。

Gaghiel dove at the ground, so low its A.T. field ripped up forests and buildings as it streaked for Unit-01. The Eva's left-side pauldron parted for the prog-knife. The Angel was quicker, catching Asuka's breath as a dozen of its winged shards lanced forth to burrow in the Eva's thick plating. Shinji's frequency stuttered as Unit-01 collapsed into the side of a apartment complex, barely managing to keep on its feet.  
Gaghiel 俯冲向地面，低到它的 A.T.力场撕裂了森林和建筑，直奔初号机而去。Eva 的左侧肩甲为推进刀让路。天使更快，当它的数十片翼状碎片刺穿初号机的厚重装甲时，明日香几乎屏住了呼吸。随着初号机倒向一栋公寓楼的一侧，勉强保持站立，真嗣的通讯频率也出现了波动。

Her timer chirped a warning. 02:41. The pallet rifle was doing jack-all, she had to find another cable. There was one just within range behind her.  
她的计时器发出警告声。02:41。那把散弹枪毫无作用，她必须找到另一根电缆。就在她身后不远处有一根。

The shards buried in Unit-01's chest detonated, shooting chunks of metal and bio-layer over streets and homes. Shinji stifled a scream over the comms. The Angel was within melee distance.  
插入初号机胸口的碎片爆炸了，金属块和生物层碎片飞溅到街道和房屋上。真嗣在通讯中压抑着尖叫。使徒已经逼近到近战距离。

Asuka had only just set Unit-02's hand around the cable jack when light shimmered before Unit-01, the Angel's wings folding together. Hexagonal waves flashed and an unseen force ripped into it, tearing pieces of the war machine from their mountings while red fluid spat forth from deep lacerations. Unit-01 tumbled in a whirlwind of purple, green and gray as it crashed into Tokyo-3's downtown blocks. A horrible crescendo of rending steel and collapsing concrete rattled the valley.  
当明日香刚将二号机的手放在电缆插座上时，一道光芒在初号机前闪烁，使徒的翅膀合拢起来。六边形波纹闪现，一股无形的力量猛烈冲击着它，撕裂了战争机器的部件，深处的裂口喷出红色液体。初号机在紫色、绿色和灰色的旋风中翻滚，撞进了东京-3 的市中心街区。一阵撕裂钢铁和倒塌混凝土的可怕轰鸣震撼了整个山谷。

"Shinji!" A waypoint winked over Unit-01 and began flickering between yellow and red, a rapid alert tone sounding with it. The comms burst with traffic, Misato's voice bringing order to the frenzy.  
"真嗣！" 一个航点在初号机上方闪烁，颜色在黄红之间快速交替，伴随着急促的警报声。通讯频道中充斥着嘈杂的声音，美里的话语为混乱带来了秩序。

"_Damage report!_" "损伤报告！"

"_Massive trauma to the chest and abdomen!_ _The pilot's synchrograph is reversing! The pulses are flowing backwards!_"  
"胸部和腹部遭受重创！驾驶员的同步图正在反转！脉冲流向反了！"

"_Vitals?_" “生命体征？”

"_Extremely erratic. Blood is pooling away from the brain – he's going into shock! The LCL is mitigating the effects, but at this rate we're going to see cardiac arrest._"  
“极其不稳定。血液正从大脑区域积聚——他快要休克了！LCL 液正在缓解影响，但照这样下去，我们很快会看到心脏停搏。”

"_Sever the pilot's connection and stabilize his heart!_"  
“切断驾驶员的连接，稳定他的心脏！”

"_Right!_" “好！”

"_Maya, eject Unit-one's entry plug. I want recovery teams in the air. And dispatch a med-evac!_"  
“玛雅，弹出 1 号机的插入栓。我要救援队立即起飞。并派遣医疗救护！”

"_On it!_" “马上办！”

Ejecting the severed line, Asuka slammed the new cable in with clumsy force. Her plug washed green and the timer vanished. Gaghiel rose in the air, wings opening once more as if in triumph. Asuka braced the rifle stock and let loose a volley, sustained this time, her ammo counter falling to half. The Angel's shards spun in concert, twisting to avoid the streak of hellfire while its wings remained fixed. Bolts passed harmlessly through it and the Angel pushed itself in a wide arc to turn about, shards glinting in the sunlight. A cold shiver gripped tight around her spine.  
阿斯克断开被切断的线路，笨拙地用力插上新电缆。她的插头亮起绿灯，计时器随之消失。加吉尔在空中升起，翅膀再次展开，仿佛在庆祝胜利。阿斯克架稳步枪枪托，这次持续开火，弹药计数降至一半。天使的碎片协同旋转，扭曲着避开地狱火光束，而其翅膀保持不动。子弹无害地穿过它，天使以宽弧度转身，碎片在阳光下闪烁。一股寒意紧紧抓住她的脊梁。

"_Hang on, I'm getting signal errors… the Eva's back is pinned to a building facing – the hatch can't open!_"  
“坚持住，我这里信号有误…Eva 的背部被固定在一栋建筑上，面向——舱门无法打开！”

"_Then get an engineering crew on-site! Asuka – you need to get this done, now_."  
“那就让工程队到现场来！阿斯克——你必须现在完成这件事。”

"I know that!" she cried, falling back several blocks through the city. To her right, she spotted Shinji's fallen prog-spear. Bolts spat at the Angel, stopping short. The trigger clicked. Her counter blinked red.  
"我知道！" 她喊道，身体向后穿过城市退了好几步。在她右边，她看到了真嗣掉落的推进矛。子弹向使徒射去，却中途停下。扳机空响。她的计数器闪烁着红色。

"Shit." "该死。"

---

Asuka wasn't going to go see him.  
明日香不打算去看他。

She'd decided it the minute her Eva was recovered to the launch cages. In fact, she wasn't going to think about him at all the entire day. Why should she? He sure as hell wouldn't, and it wasn't like her being in his hospital room would make any difference anyway. Now that she was here in Tokyo-3 it was time he understood which of them was the superior pilot. That asinine, selfish, over-confidant, _over-zealous_ little twerp. Running in to try and show her up. He deserved what he got.  
她一看到她的 Eva 被送回发射笼就决定了。事实上，她一整天都不打算再想他。她为什么要这么做？他肯定不会，而且她出现在他的病房里也不会有任何改变。现在她来到了第三新东京市，是时候让他明白谁才是更优秀的驾驶员了。那个愚蠢、自私、过度自信、过于狂热的小鬼。跑进来试图让她难堪。他活该。

It was all she seemed able to decide upon in the noise of the Evangelion cages, shrill with the screams of power tools and the indistinct hollering to the maintenance crews. Sour smells of burnt oil and campfire smoke assaulted her nose. Mechanisms crashed as Unit-01 was locked into place further down, its crew preparing it for emergency stasis. A group of them, orange jumpsuits already marked with stains, waited on a gangway down the line. Some gripped the railing, heads hanging, while others took their hats and twisted them, pacing back and forth. A few simply stared, a palpable despondence weighing on their shoulders.  
在 Eva 笼子里嘈杂的噪音中，她似乎只能做出这个决定，尖锐的电动工具声和维修人员模糊的喊叫声此起彼伏。烧焦的机油和篝火烟味刺激着她的鼻子。随着 01 号机被固定到位，机械装置发出碰撞声，机组人员正为其准备紧急静止状态。一群人，橙色工作服上已经沾满了污渍，在一条通道上等待。有些人抓着栏杆，头低垂着，而另一些人则拿着帽子扭动，来回踱步。少数人只是呆呆地看着，肩上明显承受着沉重的绝望。

Asuka couldn't stand it. Already changed and dressed, she hurried away from the chaos of the cages and departed for the surface, gaining her stride once she boarded a railcar that began a steady climb along the GeoFront wall. On the opposite end was an elaborate network of scaffolding and mezzanines, engineers patching up an impact that had left rippled and tears in barrier. She found herself pressed up to the window, watching the landscape grow smaller and smaller, until she was right among the handful of skyscrapers still suspended in battle mode. She could see HQ's pyramid, a tiny blue gem amid patches of black forests and rugged hills the color of clay.  
明日香无法忍受了。已经换好衣服的她匆匆逃离了笼子里的混乱，登上了一辆沿着地底都市墙壁稳步上升的轨道车，一旦上车便加快了步伐。在对面是一套复杂的脚手架和夹层平台，工程师们正在修补一个在屏障上留下波纹和裂痕的撞击。她发现自己紧贴着窗户，看着风景越来越小，直到她置身于少数几座仍处于战斗模式的摩天大楼之中。她能看到总部金字塔，一颗小小的蓝色宝石，周围是黑色森林和泥土色的崎岖山丘。

It awed her that something like this could even exist. There was no other city in the world as advanced, and it was part of her job to protect it, she knew. There was a time when the thought of doing it alone had weighed on her, even if she took immense pride in being one of the elite few that could.  
这让她感到震撼，这样的存在竟然可能存在。世界上没有其他城市如此先进，而她的工作就是保护它，她知道。曾经有一段时间，独自完成这项任务的想法让她感到沉重，尽管她对自己能成为精英中的少数人之一感到无比自豪。

At the moment, she may as well have been the only one. Sure, the other two pilots were there, but one of them she had yet to meet and the other... Shinji wasn't just some no-name pilot she could brush off as insignificant, no matter how much she might have wanted to. That's what really made it so unbearable.  
此刻，她仿佛成了唯一的存在。没错，另外两名驾驶员也在场，但其中一位她还未曾谋面，而另一位... 真嗣不仅仅是一个她可以轻易忽视的无名小卒，无论她多么希望如此。这才是真正让她难以忍受的原因。

Trying again to dispel her discontent, Asuka fell back in her seat and crossed her legs, glancing at her watch. Only an hour ago she'd been released from her NERV-ly duties, the most tedious of which had been the debriefing. Simple enough, if not impromptu. Misato hadn't even been the one to give it to her, busy with the buzz of post-op. Instead it was some tech from the command center. Ao-something. She couldn't remember.  
再次试图驱散心中的不满，明日香向后靠在椅背上，翘起腿，瞥了一眼手表。仅仅一小时前，她才从 NERV 的职责中解脱出来，其中最乏味的莫过于汇报会。虽然简单，却颇为突然。美里甚至没有亲自来主持，她正忙于战后的忙碌。反而是指挥中心的一个技术人员来负责。姓氏似乎是 Ao 什么的，她记不清了。

Then it had been a horrific process being directed to the changing rooms outside the Eva cages, again. Although the shower had probably been the best in her life, if only because of how awful the lead up had been. Just soaking in steaming streams had been a relief. To immediately flatten the pure serenity that had brought was the fact she hadn't packed much in the way of clothes with her carry on. Her dress was done for the day and she had no desire to throw the thing back on. Not that it was difficult, but she felt its impact had been horribly deflated and she wasn't going to expend the effort if she didn't have to.  
然后，被指引到 Eva 笼子外的更衣室，又一次，这过程真是糟糕透顶。虽然那淋浴可能是她一生中最好的，仅仅因为之前的经历有多糟糕。仅仅是沉浸在蒸汽腾腾的水流中就是一种解脱。立刻打破这种纯粹宁静的是，她随身携带的行李中并没有带多少衣服。她的裙子已经穿了一天，她也不想再把它穿回去。虽然不难，但她觉得它的影响力已经严重减弱，如果没必要，她不想再费这个劲。

The NERV train at last came to the surface, arcing along the edge of the the city by its southern mountains. On the outskirts Tokyo-3 was a tangle of compact shacks, bars and run-down businesses strung together with a haphazard array of telephone lines. Among them were sleek, modern buildings that slowly phased them out until there was nothing but an ordered maze of skyscrapers, looking like they belonged to another world and had appeared there by some cosmic slip in dimensions.  
NERV 的列车终于驶出地面，沿着城市南部的山脉边缘弧形行驶。在东京-3 的郊区，是一片紧凑的棚屋、酒吧和破旧的商铺，由一团乱麻般的电话线串联起来。其中夹杂着一些流线型、现代化的建筑，它们逐渐取代了那些老旧的房屋，直到只剩下一片有序的摩天大楼迷宫，仿佛它们属于另一个世界，因某种宇宙维度的错位而出现在那里。

From her waning vantage point she could make out the crumbling, twisted paths of destruction carved out in the earlier battle. She tried to associate each one with a moment in the fight, tracking the movements made, the constant setbacks she'd been forced to endure. All thanks to her co-pilot.  
从她逐渐模糊的视角中，她能辨认出先前战斗中留下的破碎、扭曲的破坏痕迹。她试图将每一条痕迹与战斗中的某个时刻联系起来，追踪所做的动作，以及被迫承受的不断挫折。这一切都要归咎于她的副驾驶。

He'd ruined everything. 他把一切都搞砸了。

She supposed it wasn't much different from before. When they were younger there had been a point when Asuka realized Shinji was holding her back. He was smart enough, but there was a clear gap in their abilities and even he knew it. She could admit that at least when it came to extra-curricular, she wasn't very good at things like playing violin or transliteration and anything at all related to sports outside of tennis. She just worked harder at her short comings than everyone else, so they never confused excellence for weakness. Especially not Shinji.  
她想，这与以前并没有太大不同。在他们年轻时，曾有一段时间，明日香意识到真嗣在拖她的后腿。他足够聪明，但他们的能力之间存在明显的差距，甚至他自己也清楚这一点。她可以承认，至少在课外活动方面，她不擅长拉小提琴或翻译，以及任何与网球以外的体育运动相关的事情。她只是比其他人更努力地克服自己的不足，因此他们从未将卓越与弱点混淆。尤其是真嗣。

Asuka contemplated this as the train brought her ever closer to the steel monoliths, eager to be out of the frigid air conditioning. A sleeveless button up tee and shorts weren't well suited to cold. The car squealed into its berth and the doors parted to a wall of heat, making her regret her haste to depart. She descended into busy streets, unsure of her destination. The station let off just on the border of downtown, where she joined step with herds of people moving under a curving stretch of road. Blocky supports arced over it, trains rattling above them. Between the gaps in causeways were those massive towers, unmoving and strange in purpose through the twisted lens of electric cables and power boxes.  
明日香思索着这一切，随着列车不断驶近那些钢铁巨塔，她急切地想要逃离那冰冷的空调环境。无袖的纽扣 T 恤和短裤并不适合寒冷的天气。车厢尖叫着停靠在站台，车门打开，一股热浪扑面而来，让她后悔自己急于离开的决定。她走下列车，融入繁忙的街道，对自己的目的地感到迷茫。车站位于市中心的边缘，她随着人流在一条弯曲的道路下前行。方形的支撑柱在头顶上方拱起，列车在上方轰鸣而过。高架桥间的空隙中矗立着那些巨大的塔楼，在扭曲的电线和电源箱的映衬下，它们静止不动，用途显得神秘而奇特。

She started to move against the flow of traffic, though no one was disturbed in the least. Her hair occasionally drew a curious glance or two, but nothing more beyond that. Every open surface along the sidewalks was either a restaurant, store front, or LED grid to display colorful, splashing advertisements. The scent of spice was what drew her along, sharp and overwhelming to her foreign nose. It was mingled and choked by hot rubber and gasoline boiling and dissipating in the summer afternoon, except it should have been fall. Strangest of all was that she could hear the cicada bugs even in the middle of the city, louder than they had ever been back home.  
她开始逆着车流移动，尽管这丝毫没有打扰到任何人。她的头发偶尔会引来一两个好奇的目光，但也就仅此而已。人行道旁的每一处开放空间要么是餐馆，要么是商店橱窗，或是用来展示五彩斑斓、炫目广告的 LED 屏幕。吸引她的是那股香料的味道，对她这个外来者来说既尖锐又难以抗拒。这味道与夏日午后沸腾散发的橡胶和汽油味混合在一起，令人窒息，尽管现在本应是秋天。最奇怪的是，即便在城市中心，她也能听到蝉鸣，比在家乡时任何时候都要响亮。

There was one time she'd convinced Shinji to try and catch one for her, up until she saw the creatures up close and kept them far away, revolted. Whenever they fought he would threaten to stick them in her hair.  
有一次，她曾说服真嗣帮她捉一只蝉，直到她近距离看到这些生物，便避之不及，感到厌恶。每当他们争吵时，他就会威胁要把蝉塞进她的头发里。

"I'll beat you if you try." She held up a fist for emphasis.  
“你敢试试，我就揍你。”她举起拳头以示强调。

Shinji shrugged, scratching his chin. "Then I'll do it while you're sleeping."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，挠着下巴说：“那我就趁你睡觉的时候做。”

"_Shinji Ikari_," she said, planting her feet and pinning him with a finger, "I will never forgive you if you do!"  
“碇真嗣，”她站稳脚跟，用手指着他，厉声道，“你要是敢这么做，我绝不会原谅你！”

She couldn't remember exactly how old they'd been.  
她记不清他们当时到底多大了。

Though it wasn't a very conscious choice, Asuka had slowly stopped spending so much time with Shinji, and later rationalized that it was so they wouldn't be friends and she could go to Heidelberg without worry; the college her mother had decided on before she could even walk. It was a high bar and she was expected to reach well above, and she would. If only it had been that simple. Things were never simple when it came to her friend.  
虽然这并非一个深思熟虑的决定，但阿斯卡渐渐减少了与真嗣共度的时间，后来她合理化这一行为，认为这样他们就不会成为朋友，她可以无忧无虑地去海德堡；那是她母亲在她还不会走路时就定下的目标。这是一个很高的标杆，她被期望远远超越，她也一定会做到。如果事情真有那么简单就好了。一旦涉及到她的朋友，事情从来都不简单。

He was just... 他只是……

She'd always tried to push him to apply himself. For a while she even thought it would be nice if he could go to college with her. Asuka had quickly dissociated from that idea. If nothing else than because it was absurd to want his company that badly. Not to mention the fact he couldn't have cared either way. Shinji never put more effort towards education than was required and constantly groaned about the workload, to the point where she snapped at him whenever he brought it up. Then he would sulk and she'd spend the day damning him for making her work so hard at not feeling miserable as a result.  
她一直试图推动他努力自立。有一段时间，她甚至觉得如果他能和她一起上大学会很好。但阿斯卡很快摒弃了这个想法。不仅仅是因为渴望他的陪伴到那种程度太荒谬了，更不用说他根本不在乎这些。真嗣从未在学业上付出比必要更多的努力，而且经常抱怨作业负担，以至于她每次听到都会对他发火。然后他会闷闷不乐，而她则整天诅咒他，因为她不得不如此努力地克制自己不因此感到难过。

There were plenty of times she genuinely hated him for it. Maybe she still did, at least a little. But she couldn't afford to slack off, to be childish and immature. If she wanted to get into Heidelberg, she had to work that hard. He didn't understand and he didn't care.  
她确实有无数次真心实意地恨他。也许现在依然如此，至少还有一点。但她不能松懈，不能幼稚和不成熟。如果她想进入海德堡大学，她就必须如此努力。他不理解，也不在乎。

Ugly and guffawing laughter from a convenience store made her stop short. Two men within continued their conversation, a familiar voice coming through the hollow sounding speakers in the ceiling. It sounded like Tatsuro, though she couldn't peg the song. _Someday_, maybe.  
一家便利店里传出的丑陋大笑声让她猛地停下脚步。两个男人在里面继续他们的对话，一个熟悉的声音从天花板上空洞的扬声器中传来。听起来像是 Tatsuro，尽管她无法确定是哪首歌。也许有一天，她会知道的。

Turning to the road ahead, NERV's red warning labels tagged the walkways and street side gridlock gates. Whether she followed them on feel or maneuvered a random path, Asuka didn't know, only that she ended up in a place quieter in the city than anywhere else, devoid of the same hustle and bustle she had been absorbed in. Beyond a wall of fencing she could see wreckage from the earlier battle – one of the severed umbilical cables. A gust of chilled air brushed her right shoulder, drawing her eyes to a wide tunnel lit with soft orange bulbs.  
转向前方的道路，NERV 的红色警告标志贴满了人行道和街边交通堵塞的栅栏。无论是凭感觉跟随还是随意选择路径，明日香不知道，只知道她最终来到了一个比城市其他地方更安静的地方，没有了她之前沉浸的喧嚣。透过一堵围墙，她可以看到早先战斗的残骸——其中一根被切断的脐带电缆。一阵寒风拂过她的右肩，吸引她看向一个宽阔的隧道，柔和的橙色灯泡照亮了那里。

She crossed the street to enter and reached out to touch the wall. Cold shivered through her finger tips, which reveled in the smooth marble-like surface as she brushed them across it.  
她穿过街道进入，伸手触摸那面墙。寒意从指尖透入，她享受着光滑如大理石的表面，轻轻拂过。

The corridor opened to a groaning cavern that brought with it whispers of a dream she used to have, yet there was a degree of comfort that took residence in her step. The space was wide and open and grand, in a brutal and simplistic sort of way. In all directions pillars thicker around than buses reached at least ten stories high, a concrete woodland that stretched into obscurity. Sunlight pooled in from the edges of the forest, giving the place a welcoming sort of calm. Water pattered somewhere nearby in the semi-darkness and above her the rumbling of trains and traffic resonated through the ceiling. The sounds of it rolled like thunder.  
走廊通向一个呻吟的洞穴，带着她曾有过的梦境的低语，但她的步伐中却有一种舒适感。空间宽阔、开放且宏伟，以一种粗犷而简约的方式。四面八方，比公交车还粗的柱子至少有十层楼高，一片混凝土森林延伸至朦胧之中。阳光从森林边缘洒入，给这个地方带来一种宜人的宁静。水声在半明半暗中某处滴落，而头顶上，火车和交通的轰鸣声透过天花板传来，如雷鸣般滚动。

Even though she was no longer climbing a dark shaft to reach the surface, somehow it felt like she was still inbetween. Still isolated.  
尽管她不再攀爬黑暗的竖井以到达地面，不知为何，她仍感觉自己处于两者之间，依然孤立无援。

A faint huff echoed to her and she stilled, searching the wide expanse. At the far end, by a waterway run off, a black four-legged figure moved through the light, soon absorbed in the white radiance from outside. Small streaks of blood trailed behind it.  
一声微弱的喘息传入她的耳中，她静止不动，搜索着广阔的空间。在远处，靠近一条排水渠的地方，一个黑色的四足身影在光影中移动，很快便被外面的白光吞没。几缕血迹拖在它的身后。

Every instinct in her said to turn-tail the other way and never look back, but Asuka approached the beast carefully, unable to distill her curiosity. It had made its way down the run off, to a narrow bridge along what looked like an old floodgate, built over and forgotten by Tokyo-3's superstructure. Beyond it lay a beach touching the waters of lake Ashi, overburdened with vegetation and trash.  
她所有的本能都在告诉她转身离开，永不回头，但明日香小心翼翼地接近那头野兽，无法抑制自己的好奇心。它沿着排水渠走下来，来到一座狭窄的桥边，桥旁似乎是一座旧的防洪闸门，被东京-3 的超级建筑所覆盖和遗忘。桥的另一边是一片触碰着芦之湖水面的海滩，杂草丛生，垃圾遍地。

At first glance she guessed it was a wolf, but dismissed that as absurd. It wasn't as large as one might be and wore a shorter snout from what she remembered of pictures. It's side heaved to produce little more than labored sighs, each one a rasping wheeze that sounded like it was tearing up the poor thing's throat.  
乍一看，她猜测那是一只狼，但随即觉得这想法荒谬。它没有她记忆中图片里的狼那么大，鼻子也更短。它的侧腹起伏，发出的声音与其说是喘息，不如说是沉重的叹息，每一次都像是撕裂着那可怜家伙的喉咙。

"So you can't breath either," she said, unwilling to move any closer. Sharp eyes regarded her without fear or worry. Dark blood oozed from deep punctures in its neck. Around its ankles clung raw, scabbing skin and across its side were tears where hair no longer grew. It must have been fighting.  
"所以你也喘不过气来，"她说，不愿再靠近。锐利的眼睛毫无畏惧或忧虑地注视着她。黑色的血液从它脖子上的深刺孔中渗出。它的脚踝周围是粗糙、结痂的皮肤，而它的侧身则是毛发不再生长的撕裂伤。它一定是在战斗中受的伤。

A whine squealed from its throat, making her feel at a loss. "What the heck am I supposed to do about it?" she mumbled. It wasn't her fault it was dying.  
它喉咙里发出一声哀鸣，让她感到无所适从。"我到底该怎么办？"她喃喃自语。它濒临死亡，这并不是她的错。

What else could she do?  
她还能做什么呢？

As if in answer, the beast stilled and its eyes fixed on nothing. The space around her fell mute.  
仿佛在回应，那野兽静止了，目光凝视着虚无。她周围的空间陷入了沉默。

Asuka tilted her head, puzzled. By its face a small seedling had sprouted through the rusted grating. Bits of moisture clung affectionately to its lavender petals, some sliding off to welcome the earth at its stem. It looked like a mountain flower of some sort, or maybe a bellflower? What was the Japanese word for it... kikyou? That couldn't be right, not all the way down here. If Shinji were there he'd have the name in a heartbeat. In fact, he could probably name the flower from kingdom to genus, and would know when it came in bloom and where it was found most in the world.  
明日香歪着头，感到困惑。在它的脸旁，一株小苗从锈蚀的格栅中冒出。水珠依恋地附着在它淡紫色的花瓣上，有些滑落下来，迎接茎部的大地。它看起来像某种山花，或者是风铃草？日语里叫什么来着……桔梗？这不可能，不可能在这里。如果真嗣在的话，他肯定能立刻说出名字。事实上，他或许能从界到属一一列举，还知道它何时开花，以及在世界上的哪些地方最常见。

It reminded her of the Amaranthus back home. Since discovering its place among the roses vacant she had spent some time wondering where it had gone. Until she came across it in the clearing by the old olive tree, dead, but colored the same vibrant purple she remembered. Among other things she thought forgotten. She'd never been able to find the tree again after that.  
这让她想起了家乡的苋菜。自从发现它不在玫瑰丛中后，她花了一些时间思考它去了哪里。直到她在那棵老橄榄树旁的空地上再次见到它，已经枯萎，但颜色依旧是她记忆中的鲜艳紫色。还有其他一些她以为已经遗忘的事物。那之后，她再也没能找到那棵树。

Asuka frowned and all at once her limbs ached and she wanted to vomit. Bending to close the wolfdog's eyes, she stopped half way, considering it nice to think that he were still staring at the foreign blossom.  
明日香皱起眉头，突然间四肢酸痛，她感到一阵恶心。弯腰去合上狼狗的眼睛，她中途停了下来，觉得这样想着它仍在凝视那朵异国花朵也挺好。

In the end, she left the beast and the flower as they were, feeling she had strayed long enough.  
最终，她留下了那只野兽和花朵，感觉自己已经徘徊得够久了。

---

Ever since she was little Asuka had hated hospitals. It wasn't just the sterile echo of long, wide corridors or the nasal burning scent of bleach, a pleasant aroma compared to some of the older hospitals in Germany. Which had been erected in the seventies and, despite constant renovation, still retained the damp, heavy stench of decay. No, it was a myriad of things, mainly the pathetic dregs of patients and the indifferent faces of the nurses and doctors. The throwaways and seniles. It burnt her fuse so short that if anyone passing had dared utter a simple "hello" she might have exploded on them.  
自小以来，明日香就讨厌医院。不仅仅是那长长走廊里的消毒回声，或是漂白剂那刺鼻的气味——与德国一些老医院相比，这还算得上是宜人的香气。那些医院建于七十年代，尽管不断翻新，仍保留着潮湿、沉重的腐烂气息。不，是无数因素的综合，主要是那些可怜的病人残余和护士医生冷漠的面孔。被抛弃的人和老年痴呆者。这让她怒火中烧，以至于如果有人经过时胆敢简单地说声“你好”，她可能会当场爆发。

But the only voices she heard were from hospital staff and patients down the halls, passersby paying her little mind. Every so often the PA called for doctors and nurses and penetrating it all was the clicking of the clock on the wall across from her. For what must have been the thousandth time that afternoon, she regarded it with a baleful glance.  
但她听到的只有走廊上医护人员和病人的声音，路人几乎不曾留意她。每隔一段时间，广播就会呼叫医生和护士，而贯穿这一切的，是墙对面时钟的滴答声。那个下午，她一定已经第千次地用恶狠狠的目光盯着它了。

It was nearly six o'clock now. Asuka had been told to wait since four and had run out of things to do on her phone in the first fifteen minutes. She knew it was pointless to go hound the staff at the information desk – they would let her see him when they decided he was ready. Which was taking forever. Maybe she could have gotten up and wandered around the hospital, but that thought was even less appealing than leaving NERV's in-house facilities to explore the GeoFront. The place was still being d-coned from the battle before last anyway. She had hoped to go out and see everything with Kaji, but he'd been put to work before they even left the tarmac, and she was done wandering around topside by herself.  
现在快六点了。明日香从四点开始就被要求等待，手机上的事情在前十五分钟就做完了。她知道去信息台纠缠工作人员毫无意义——他们会在决定他准备好时让她见他。这简直没完没了。也许她本可以起身在医院里四处走走，但这个想法甚至比离开 NERV 内部设施去探索 GeoFront 更不吸引人。这个地方仍在从上一场战斗中进行消毒。她本希望能和加持一起出去看看一切，但他还没离开停机坪就被安排了工作，而她也不想独自在上层徘徊。

Not that she wasn't excited to finally be at Headquarters. She was, but with the battle and everything... and the fact she'd only a few hours ago been told she wouldn't be staying with Kaji and would instead be provided an in-house set of sleeping quarters – Asuka was beyond fed up with everything, and she'd only just arrived.  
并非说她不兴奋终于来到了总部。她确实兴奋，但战斗和一切...还有几个小时前被告知她不会和加持住在一起，而是会被安排一套内部宿舍——明日香对这一切已经厌烦透顶，而她才刚到。

So here she was, dressed as casually as could be and waiting to see her friend of eight years. Not counting the last couple, since he clearly hadn't himself. Why should she? Asuka huffed and looked down the hall. Cold metal beneath the seat touched her leg. Memories of the Kloster trickled through her.  
所以她现在就这样，尽可能随意地打扮，等待着她八年的朋友。不算最后那几年，因为他显然自己也没算。她为什么要算？明日香哼了一声，朝走廊望去。座椅下冰冷的金属触感碰到了她的腿。克洛斯特的记忆悄然涌入。

At the age of eleven, Asuka wanted there to be a reason. A concrete reason as to why she no longer felt the way she once did. A reason would have made it easier. It would have made her feel less guilty. It would have made the dissolution less strange and painful.  
十一岁时，明日香希望有一个理由。一个具体的理由，解释为什么她不再有以前的感觉。一个理由会让事情变得容易些。会让她感觉不那么内疚。会让这种分离不那么奇怪和痛苦。

It was why she hadn't told Shinji when she received her acceptance letter to Heidelberg. She was overwhelmed with excitement at the prospect of going to college in such a grand city. Where Roman Legionaries had once made camp and crossed the river Neckar, forming the foundation for Bergheim, the mountain home. Up on the hillside stood the seven-hundred-year old red stone walls of Heidelberg Castle, which watched over the town below. Walking through the streets had reminded her of the countryside she grew up in, not that she'd been particularly happy there. Not, at least, while in her father's estate, cooped up in a house of burnt siennas, charcoal grays and deep-sea greens.  
这就是为什么她收到海德堡大学的录取通知书时没有告诉真嗣。她对能在这座宏伟的城市上大学的前景感到无比兴奋。曾经罗马军团在此扎营并跨越内卡河，为贝格海姆——山中家园奠定了基础。在山坡上矗立着已有七百年历史的红色石墙海德堡城堡，俯瞰着下面的城镇。走在街道上让她想起了她成长的那片乡村，尽管她在父亲的庄园里并不特别快乐，被囚禁在一座由烧赭色、炭灰色和深海绿构成的房子里。

Back before she'd gone, she knew Shinji wouldn't be excited about it. More than that, it was a solid reminder of how completely far removed she would be from him, an idea as invasive and heavy as the stones climbing Heidelberg. She could have told him months in advance, but time and again a sledge hammer of doubt shattered her nerve, which was a perplexing rarity. Or she talked herself out of it so thoroughly with arguments and counter arguments she'd have made any silver-tongued lawyer envious.  
在她去之前，她就知道真嗣对此不会感到兴奋。更重要的是，这让她清楚地意识到自己将与他相隔多远，这种想法如同攀登海德堡的石头一样侵入且沉重。她本可以提前几个月告诉他，但一次又一次，怀疑的铁锤击碎了她的勇气，这种情况颇为罕见。或者她用各种论点和反论点说服自己放弃，以至于任何能言善辩的律师都会羡慕不已。

But that was just it, Asuka had never been one to hold back what was on her mind. With this she was, again, forced to acknowledge how differently she treated Shinji compared to everyone else. She decided then to reaffirm the promise four-year-old Asuka had made to herself. Besides, it was around then that he'd started avoiding her at school for a second time. Sure, she had her advanced classes, but he never even looked her way during lunch when she sat with the other girls, or sent her a text between classes as had become normal, usually catching a train or bus home before her. At first, she hadn't even noticed it. She was busy with her studies and he'd already decided he didn't care about that.  
但问题就在这里，明日香从来都不是一个会隐藏自己想法的人。正因为如此，她不得不再次承认自己对待真嗣与其他人有多么不同。她决定重新确认四岁时的明日香对自己许下的承诺。而且，大约就在那时，他开始在学校第二次回避她。当然，她有自己的高级课程，但午餐时她与其他女孩坐在一起，他从未向她投来目光，课间也不再像往常那样发短信给她，通常在她之前就赶乘火车或公交车回家。起初，她甚至没有注意到这一点。她忙于学业，而他早已决定不再关心这些。

Gaelle and Laura were there to keep her company too. She'd made friends with the two girls a couple of summers ago when Laura, sitting down for her first day in advanced placement, turned to her and said she had a crush on Erich Koellner. He was a flat-jawed boy that sat at the front of the class, with short cropped sienna hair and bright green eyes. She didn't care much for that, but she did like his white teeth, which she could see whenever he smiled. Asuka commented on as much, which got Laura to giggling and Gaelle, sitting just behind them, whisper-shouted that she'd heard he and Lisa Schneider had kissed by the dead willow tree in the park. The waterfall of gossip formed a tight-knit friendship.  
加埃勒和劳拉也在那里陪着她。几年前的夏天，阿苏卡和这两个女孩成了朋友，当时劳拉在高级课程的第一天坐下后，转头对她说她对埃里希·科尔纳有好感。埃里希是个下巴平平的男孩，坐在教室前排，留着短短的赭色头发和明亮的绿眼睛。阿苏卡对此并不太在意，但她确实喜欢他那口白牙，每次他微笑时她都能看到。阿苏卡这么一说，劳拉便咯咯笑了起来，而坐在她们后面的加埃勒则小声喊道，她听说埃里希和莉莎·施耐德在公园的枯柳树下接过吻。这一连串的八卦让她们结成了亲密的友谊。

Asuka spent most of her time with Laura as they went between classes and visited the Kloster's menagerie of teachers during downtime. All while they talked about which of the girls said what, to who, and how terribly shallow all of them were. They shared secrets, painted nails, and occasionally braided one another's hair. Though Asuka never let them touch hers.  
阿苏卡大部分时间都和劳拉在一起，她们穿梭于各个教室之间，在空闲时拜访克洛斯特的老师们。她们谈论着哪个女孩说了什么，对谁说的，以及她们有多么肤浅。她们分享秘密，涂指甲油，偶尔还会给对方编辫子。不过阿苏卡从不让她们碰她的头发。

Then Laura disappeared. 然后劳拉消失了。

The strange thing was, Asuka still saw her in classes and moving about the Kloster with Gaelle. But for whatever reason, she had stopped existing in Laura's world. Asuka tried to figure it out, to understand what had happened to cause her friend's sudden and cold shoulder. Her calls were ignored, and the two avoided her between classes. Occasionally, Gaelle would shoot her an apologetic look, but didn't really speak with her again.  
奇怪的是，尽管在课堂上和克拉斯特修道院里，阿苏卡依然能看到加埃勒的身影，但在劳拉的世界里，她却似乎不复存在。阿苏卡试图弄清楚原因，理解是什么导致了好友突然的冷漠。她的电话被无视，两人在课间也避开了她。偶尔，加埃勒会投来一个歉意的眼神，但再也没有真正与她交谈过。

It was around then, during calm and dry Autumn nights, when Asuka arrived home from another day of forcing a smile on her face and putting up with shallow peers, that she felt Shinji's absence creeping over her. Like the malformed shadow of him that still decorated the wall next to her bed. How she sat in front of her mirror and grew sick to the point of nausea staring at her own reflection, scratching charcoal over the surface until she couldn't recognize herself anymore. No one came to knock on her door in the mornings. Nights in her room were silent and still, as though she'd been buried under miles of dirt.  
就在那时，在平静而干燥的秋夜，阿苏卡结束了一天强颜欢笑、忍受肤浅同伴的日子回到家中，她感受到了真嗣的缺席悄然袭来。就像他那扭曲的影子依然装饰在她床边的墙上。她坐在镜子前，凝视着自己的倒影，直到恶心得几乎要吐出来，用炭笔在镜面上划过，直到再也认不出自己。早晨再也没有人来敲她的门。她房间里的夜晚静谧无声，仿佛被埋在数英里深的泥土之下。

She wouldn't be ignored anymore.  
她不会再被忽视了。

Asuka really wanted to hurt him. When she finally managed to catch him out by the lockers, her hand came to rest over his throat as he put his back against them. She didn't squeeze or keep much pressure there at all. In fact she didn't even know why it had moved there to begin with. Harsh orange afternoon bled through the windows. He had just finished a practice game and no one else was about. It was just the two of them, mere inches apart.  
明日香真的很想伤害他。当她终于在储物柜旁逮到他时，她的手落在了他的喉咙上，而他则背靠着柜子。她并没有用力挤压或施加太多压力。事实上，她甚至不知道为什么手会移到那里。透过窗户，刺眼的橙色午后阳光洒了进来。他刚结束一场练习赛，周围没有其他人。只有他们两个，相距仅几英寸。

She asked him what his problem was and all he delivered were useless, pitiful excuses she didn't believe for a minute.  
她问他有什么问题，而他给出的全是些无用的、可怜的借口，她一分钟也不相信。

"_Liar_," she hissed. Everyone was a liar. Even him.  
“骗子，”她低声咒骂。每个人都是骗子。包括他。

After that, she remembered neither of them actually said anything, though an entire conversation could have passed between them for the amount of time she kept her hand on the warmth of his neck and his glare rested to something softer, but resolved. What exactly happened beyond that, Asuka couldn't say. That's how angry she must've been. It was the only time true blanks in her memory appeared.  
之后，她记不清他们中的任何一个实际说了什么，尽管在她将手放在他脖颈的温暖上，他的目光变得柔和但坚定的时间里，他们之间可能已经进行了一场完整的对话。至于那之后究竟发生了什么，明日香无法言明。她当时一定非常愤怒，这是她记忆中唯一出现真正空白的一次。

But by the end they were friends again, all the while she couldn't figure out why he had stopped talking to her, like Laura and Gaelle had done. Was it something she did? Her pride forged reasons for the others, found dark pits to abandon them in kind, and she soldiered on. But for Shinji there were no answers. Only doubts and distance. Of all people, why him?  
但最终他们又成了朋友，尽管她始终不明白他为何像劳拉和盖尔那样停止与她交谈。是她做了什么吗？她的自尊心为其他人找了各种理由，将它们丢弃在黑暗的深渊中，她继续前行。但对于真嗣，她找不到任何答案，只有疑虑和距离。为什么偏偏是他？

She kept him at arm's length for a while. Not that it mattered much, since only weeks later she was off to Heidelberg. She moved in with an Aunt and Uncle, though would have much rather lived with Kaji, her NERV assigned on-campus guardian. The others she never saw, mostly because she rarely spent any time in their company. Either she was in her room writing papers or on the balcony studying for the next mid-term. There was no one else her age at the college and all of the older kids gave her curious looks whenever she walked to and fro. Some even had the gall to ask her where her parents were or if she was lost. Asuka kept a pleasant face and offered polite remarks while she imagined elaborate fantasies of verbally shaming them in public.  
她曾一度与他保持距离。不过这也没太大关系，毕竟几周后她便前往海德堡。她与姨妈和姨父同住，尽管她更愿意与 NERV 指派的校园监护人加持同住。其他人她几乎不见，主要是因为她很少与他们共处。要么她在房间里写论文，要么在阳台上为下一次期中考试复习。大学里没有同龄人，每当她来回走动时，年长的学生们都会投来好奇的目光。有些人甚至大胆地问她父母在哪里，或者她是否迷路了。明日香保持着愉快的表情，礼貌地回应，同时脑海中幻想着在公共场合用言辞羞辱他们的复杂场景。

Once the other students caught on to why this mere eleven-year-old was attending the lectures and speaking with the professors, their demeanor turned sour. Often, she heard them talking when they thought she wasn't listening, and made herself take in every harsh word and snide criticism. She took them and hardened her skin. They were jealous, and why shouldn't they be? It was during those demeaning talks, the walks down the marble corridors to other classes and the droning of the professors in the lecture halls, where she started to think of Shinji and realized that she wanted to see him again. To hear his voice.  
当其他学生意识到为何这个年仅十一岁的小女孩会来听讲座并与教授们交谈时，他们的态度变得不善。她常常听到他们在以为她没在听时窃窃私语，并强迫自己接受每一个尖酸刻薄的字眼和嘲讽的批评。她接受了这些，使自己变得坚强。他们是嫉妒，他们为何不该嫉妒呢？正是在这些贬低的话语中，走在去其他教室的大理石走廊上，以及教授们在讲堂上的喋喋不休中，她开始想念真嗣，意识到她想再次见到他。想听到他的声音。

They'd spoken infrequently since her arrival and she sent the occasional message when she felt like it. When she didn't get a response the thought of sending anything faded and she became further engrossed in her studies. It had been a few months since either had said anything to the other. For a little while, she thought of texting him again, probably more than anyone should have thought about anything, until it started to affect her scores. So she deleted his number. That way she wouldn't be tempted, and wouldn't have to be so distracted anymore.  
自从她来到这里，他们很少交谈，她偶尔会在想的时候发消息给他。当她没有收到回复时，发消息的念头就消失了，她更加沉浸在学业中。已经有几个月他们没有互相说过话了。有一段时间，她想过再次给他发短信，可能比任何人都更频繁地想着某件事，直到这开始影响她的成绩。于是她删除了他的号码。这样她就不会再受诱惑，也不必再如此分心了。

It only worked for a few weeks. The longer she tried to ignore the feeling, the more intense and pressing it became. So at last she decided to send him some throw away text like, "hey, how are you. whats up?" whatever, no big deal – except she couldn't remember what his number was. She could grasp the classical dynamics of spinning tops, but couldn't remember her best friend's stupid phone number.  
这方法只奏效了几个星期。她越是试图忽视那种感觉，它就变得越强烈和紧迫。最终，她决定给他发条无关痛痒的短信，比如，“嘿，你好吗？最近怎么样？”随便吧，没什么大不了的——只是她记不起他的号码了。她能掌握旋转陀螺的经典动力学，却记不住她最好朋友的愚蠢电话号码。

That brought with it another line of questioning. Was he really her best friend anymore? It wasn't something she dwelled on at length, his status as her friend, at least. Shinji was always there, whether she wanted him to be or not, he was. Even when she was away from him, he managed to subtly invade her thoughts. Sometimes, he arrived to replay that last night she'd seen him in person back at the estate, when she'd been so beside herself with his silence she'd gone into his room and torn the place apart. Looking for that stupid drawing he'd made of her. That would get his attention.  
这引发了一连串新的疑问。他真的还是她最好的朋友吗？她并没有长时间深究他作为朋友的地位，至少没有。真嗣总是在那里，无论她是否希望他在，他都在。即使她离开他，他也能巧妙地侵入她的思绪。有时，他会出现在她的脑海中，重播她最后一次在庄园见到他的那个夜晚，当时她因为他的沉默而心烦意乱，闯进他的房间，把那里翻了个底朝天。寻找那张他为她画的愚蠢的画。那会吸引他的注意。

Her train of thought was violently derailed when patient 219's door hissed open. A nurse in blue, unflattering smocks and short haircut came out with a busy tension in her step, though looked unconcerned. She nodded to Asuka, "You can go see him now," and then she was off, papers in hand.  
当 219 号病房的门嘶嘶作响地打开时，她的思绪被猛地打断了。一位身着蓝色、不甚美观的工作服、留着短发的护士匆匆走出，步伐中带着忙碌的紧张感，但神情却显得漠不关心。她向明日香点了点头，“你现在可以进去看他了。”随后便匆匆离去，手里拿着文件。

Asuka fussed with her hair and checked her phone to see if some excuse to leave had appeared. No, she'd come here to face him. So that's what she was going to do. The door whispered aside as she approached, revealing a row of empty beds, save for one at the very end next to a wide window. He was lying with his back to her, facing the unfiltered white light of the GeoFront. A heart monitor chirped softly in the background. She started to take a step forward, or it felt like she did, but her legs didn't actually move.  
明日香摆弄着头发，检查手机看是否有借口离开的信息出现。没有，她来这里就是为了面对他。所以这就是她要做的。当她走近时，门轻轻地滑开，露出一排空床，只有最尽头靠窗的一张床上有人。他背对着她躺着，面对着地底都市未经滤过的白色光芒。心电监护仪在背景中轻柔地鸣响。她开始向前迈步，或者说感觉上如此，但她的腿实际上并未移动。

Shinji's head perked up and he rolled over, at first perplexed, until his eyes took her in and became guarded. "What are you doing here?" he asked.  
真嗣的头抬了起来，他转过身，起初有些困惑，直到他的目光捕捉到她，变得警觉起来。“你在这里做什么？”他问道。

"I just like wasting time in hospitals. Why else would I be here, idiot?" she bit back, insulted that he wasn't at all privy to her past three hours of suffering at his expense. As if in reply to her thoughts, he scoffed, but didn't say anything else. Asuka took a scathing moment to calm down, watching the cautious, skeptical way he regarded her and that stupid way his eyes blanked when he was annoyed, or the way he tensed as if ready to bark back. It only further twisted the tight bundle of nerves in her stomach.  
"我就是喜欢在医院浪费时间。不然我为什么会在这里，白痴？" 她反唇相讥，觉得他完全不了解她为了他忍受的过去三个小时的痛苦。仿佛是对她想法的回应，他嗤之以鼻，但没有再说什么。明日香花了一会儿时间冷静下来，观察着他谨慎、怀疑地打量她的方式，以及他恼怒时眼神空洞的样子，或是他紧张得仿佛随时准备反唇相讥的样子。这一切只是让她的胃里那团紧绷的神经更加纠结。

So Asuka marched forward and pinched his nose.  
于是明日香走上前去，捏住了他的鼻子。

"Ow! Asuka! Cut it out!" he flailed at her hand, cringing at an unseen sting in his right arm. She let go and he glared at her. "What's wrong with you?"  
"哎哟！明日香！住手！" 他挥手试图摆脱她的手，右臂上未见的刺痛让他皱眉。她松开手，他瞪着她。"你发什么神经？"

"Me?! What's wrong with _you_?" she cried, all of her pent up anger for the day tumbling out.  
"我？！你脑子是不是有问题？" 她喊道，一整天的积怨瞬间爆发出来。

"I'm the one in a hospit–"  
"我才是那个在医院——"

"So? You're the idiot who charged in! Did you think you were going to beat me?! You have no one to blame but yourself!" she hollered, realizing right then she hadn't been upset about anything else all day except that. How he always managed to drag under her skin and push every button without ever trying was – was – _infuriating_.  
"那又怎样？你这个傻瓜自己冲进来的！你以为你能打败我吗？！你只能怪你自己！" 她咆哮着，突然意识到她一整天除了这件事之外什么都没生气。他总是能轻而易举地惹恼她，触动她每一根神经，这简直——简直——令人抓狂。

Shinji balked, overtaken by a flash of resentment. "I can take care of myself. My unit has three ki–"  
真嗣退缩了，一股怨恨的闪念袭上心头。“我能照顾好自己。我的单位有三——”

"Your unit has two, liar. One of them is the other pilot's." she was up to the edge of the bed now, glaring down at him, just waiting to quash out any more fires of resistance. But he clamped his lips together, hands balled into fists over the sheets.  
“你的单位只有两个，骗子。其中一个属于另一个驾驶员。”她已经走到了床边，俯视着他，随时准备扑灭任何反抗的火苗。但他紧闭双唇，双手在床单上握成了拳头。

"You haven't changed at all," she said.  
“你一点都没变，”她说。

"You either." "你也是。"

"_Arschloch_," she spat. "混蛋，"她啐道。"

He deigned not to respond, compounding her frustration, and some guilt on top of that. Which only pissed her off all the more. The beeping of the heart monitor became louder and a bit more rapid. She looked away just after he did, focusing on the IV drip next to his bed, recalling with a shiver the feel of the needle pressed into her elbow. Beyond the window lay the GeoFront, the hospital planted on one of the hillsides rising along the outer wall. Most of what lay before her was an expanse of brittle, black tree trunks.  
他不予理睬，这更让她感到沮丧，还夹杂着一丝内疚。这只会让她更加恼火。心电监护仪的哔哔声变得更响，节奏也稍快了些。她在他转头的同时移开了视线，专注于他床边的静脉输液，回想起针头刺入肘部的触感，不禁打了个寒颤。窗外是地底都市，医院坐落在沿着外墙升起的山坡上。她眼前的大部分景象是一片枯萎的黑色树干。

"So what, did you just come here to yell at me?" Shinji bit out quietly, drawing her attention back. He was staring down at his hands.  
"那又怎样，你来这里就是为了对我大喊大叫吗？" 真嗣低声反问，将她的注意力拉回。他正盯着自己的双手。

"No," she grumbled, pulling a chair to plant herself. He shifted in bed, trying to sit straighter, but ultimately sinking into the pillows again. A slight pang of sympathy tickled her, but she didn't move to help. She was still angry with him.  
"不是，" 她咕哝着，拉过一把椅子坐下。他试图在床上坐直，但最终还是陷进了枕头里。一丝同情在心头掠过，但她没有动身去帮忙。她还在生他的气。

The reports of the heart monitor consumed all else for a time.  
一时间，心率监测器的报告占据了所有思绪。

"I didn't mean it," Asuka said, staring towards the foot of his bed.  
“我不是那个意思，”明日香说，目光投向他的床脚。

"What?" "什么？"

She rolled her eyes, letting them rest on the array of medical equipment at his back. Anywhere but his face. "That thing I said about the Angels, in the hangar bay, whatever."  
她翻了个白眼，目光落在背后的医疗设备上。就是不看他的脸。“我在机库说的那些关于使徒的话，随便什么。”

A pause choked between them. "Okay."  
一阵沉默卡在他们之间。“好吧。”

Asuka bounced in her seat, the quivering muscles in her stomach turning into a ripping stab that made her want to yell at him. "Yeah, so stop being so pissed off about it," she said, doing her best to sound non-chalant.  
明日香在座位上弹跳着，胃部颤抖的肌肉变成了一阵撕裂般的剧痛，让她想对他大吼。“是啊，所以别再那么生气了，”她说，尽力装作满不在乎。

"Okay." “好的。”

That earned him a glare and she shook her head, but her words were quiet. "I swear, it's like talking to a brick wall."  
这让他得到了一个白眼，她摇了摇头，但语气却很平静。“我发誓，简直像在跟一堵墙说话。”

"What are you so mad about?" he asked, sullen, like he'd already checked out of the conversation.  
“你到底在气什么？”他问道，闷闷不乐，仿佛已经对这场对话失去了兴趣。

_Alot of things!_ she wanted to shout. _Ooh_, how she hated him for this. "Nothing." she said, crossing her arms and slouching back in her seat, lips pursed. Asuka felt the heat rising to her face, coloring her cheeks red to match. Shinji didn't say anything else, and she avoided acknowledging the space he occupied.  
好多事情！她真想大喊出来。哦，她多么恨他这一点。“没什么。”她说着，双臂交叉，懒洋洋地靠在椅背上，嘴唇紧闭。明日香感到脸上热气上升，脸颊泛红。真嗣没有再说什么，而她避免承认他的存在。

"What, um, what happened? During the battle?" he asked.  
“呃，战斗中发生了什么？”他问道。

Asuka gave a lopsided shrug. "After you were taken out, I drained my magazine backing through the city. It was coming around again and the rifle wasn't doing squat anyway, so I grabbed your prog-spear from where it got stuck. When it lunged at me – I pierced the core." she refrained from grabbing her stomach, able to feel the wounds like they were her own. "It still got me, though. My Unit-two has all these ugly holes in its side now," she whined.  
明日香耸了耸肩，歪着头。“你被击倒后，我耗尽了弹药，穿过城市撤退。它又转回来了，而且步枪根本没用，所以我从卡住的地方抓起了你的推进矛。当它向我扑来时——我刺穿了核心。”她忍住了去摸肚子的冲动，仿佛能感受到那些伤口一样。“但它还是击中了我。我的二号机侧面现在满是难看的洞，”她抱怨道。

In the moment, her panic had swelled to choking as the comms overflowed with Unit-01's damage reports.  
那一刻，她的恐慌如潮水般涌来，通讯频道里充斥着初号机的损伤报告，让她几乎窒息。

Shinji hesitated, some unspoken thought clamped behind his lips. "I'm glad you won," he said, holding a gaze on her for the first time since they met off the plane.  
真嗣犹豫了一下，有些未说出口的想法紧锁在他的唇后。“我很高兴你赢了，”他说，自下飞机以来第一次与她对视。

It took her aback and her heat dissipated. "Like there was ever any doubt," she said, toying with her watch. She might have wanted to break him down for what he did earlier, but she wasn't about to bleed him dry over it. Despite her claim that he hadn't changed at all, there was something that began to create a separation from the girlhood friend of the gardens in her mind and the Shinji in front of her now. She didn't know what it was, but it inhabited every part of him, and she wasn't as sure what to do about it as she was ten minutes ago.  
这让她有些意外，心中的怒火也随之消散。“好像从来就没有什么疑问，”她摆弄着手表说道。虽然她本想因为之前的事让他吃点苦头，但也不至于让他彻底崩溃。尽管她声称他一点都没变，但某种东西开始在她心中那个花园里的童年朋友和眼前的真嗣之间划出一道界限。她不知道那是什么，但它似乎渗透在他每一个部分，而她也不再像十分钟前那样确定该如何应对。

"You're still wearing those?" his eyes stuck to the top of her head and he poked his own.  
"你还戴着那些吗？" 他的目光停留在她的头顶，然后戳了戳自己的头。

She perked up, confused, hand rising to her hair. Her fingers brushed the smooth neural clips. She wore them so often she forgot they were even there anymore. "Yeah, why wouldn't I?"  
她有些困惑地抬起头，手伸向头发。手指触碰到光滑的神经夹。她戴得太频繁，以至于几乎忘记了它们的存在。"嗯，为什么不呢？"

"You only need them for piloting."  
"你只有在驾驶时才需要它们。"

"Wow, really? I had no idea. You're so smart, Shinji, golly-gee." Internally, she winced. Why did he have to make such dumb statements?  
"哇，真的吗？我完全不知道。你真聪明，真嗣，天哪。" 她内心暗自皱眉。他为什么非得说这么蠢的话？

He was less phased this time. "Unlike you, I'm not obsessed with my Eva."  
这次他没那么动摇。"不像你，我对我的 Eva 并不痴迷。"

"I'm proud, not obsessed. It's completely different."  
"我是自豪，不是痴迷。这完全是两码事。"

"Hm, yeah," he mumbled, disagreement hanging from his slightly quirked mouth. Another minute of silence enclosed them.  
"嗯，是啊，"他咕哝着，不赞同的神情挂在他微微翘起的嘴角。又是一分钟的沉默包围了他们。

"Hey," he was looking out the window again when she finally spoke. "Do you still play the cello?"  
"嘿，"她终于开口时，他正再次望向窗外。"你还在拉大提琴吗？"

Shinji glanced over, shrugging. "Sometimes," he said, contemplating his hands, then back to her. "Why?"  
真嗣瞥了一眼，耸了耸肩。"有时候，"他说，目光落在自己的手上，然后又转向她。"怎么了？"

"I don't know, just asking."  
"我不知道，随便问问。"

"Oh… well, how about the violin?"  
"哦……那小提琴怎么样？"

"No," she said, allowing herself a melancholic sigh. "I always hated it. At least you like playing the cello."  
"不，" 她说，让自己发出一声忧郁的叹息。"我一直讨厌它。至少你喜欢拉大提琴。"

That earned her a grimace. "Not really."  
这让她皱了皱眉。“并不完全是。”

Asuka leaned forward, fist propping up her chin. "So why do you still do it? Are you that bored here?"  
明日香向前倾身，拳头撑着下巴。“那你为什么还继续做？在这里这么无聊吗？”

"I guess it's just habit. Sometimes I like it."  
“我想这只是习惯吧。有时候我还挺喜欢的。”

No eleven-year-old stayed up into the early morning playing cello just out of habit. She shook her head a little. "Yep, still the same old dull, drowsy Shinji."  
没有哪个十一岁的孩子会因为习惯而在凌晨时分还坚持拉大提琴。她轻轻摇了摇头。“是啊，还是那个老样子，无趣又昏昏欲睡的真嗣。”

He huffed at that, but there wasn't a laugh hiding beneath it. "Sorry to bore you."  
他对此轻哼一声，但并没有笑声藏匿其中。“抱歉让你觉得无聊了。”

"No, you're not." “不，你没有。”

"You're right, I'm not," he said, sporting a flat smile that looked more like a grimace. That made her bristle and she offered a disgusted face, sticking her tongue out at him, which managed little more than a chuckle in the form of another huff. It was a start. At some point they'd drifted into German, but she wasn't sure where. Probably when she'd called him an asshole.  
"你说得对，我不是，" 他说着，脸上挂着一副僵硬的微笑，看起来更像是在苦笑。这让她有些恼火，她露出厌恶的表情，朝他吐了吐舌头，但这只引来了他一声轻笑，又是一阵叹息。这是一个开始。不知何时，他们开始用德语交谈，但她不确定是从哪里开始的。大概是从她骂他混蛋的时候吧。

"Do you still pray?" he asked.  
"你还在祈祷吗？" 他问道。

"Not since I was nine," Asuka hummed.  
"从九岁起就不再祈祷了，" 明日香哼了一声。

"Really? So you just lied to Ilka for two years?"  
"真的吗？所以你对伊尔卡撒了两年谎？"

Her brow dipped. "It wasn't lying! She never asked, so I never had to cover up the fact that I wasn't. Besides, I still write to her, unlike _someone_." her leg bounced irately and for a moment she regretted the jibe, utterly loathing how this entire interaction felt like walking on eggshells. But part of her, a very tiny part she'd taken with her from the garden, felt this was familiar.  
她的眉头紧皱。“那不算撒谎！她从没问过，所以我也没必要掩饰我不是的事实。再说，我还在给她写信，不像某些人。”她的腿不耐烦地弹动着，有那么一刻她后悔了那句讽刺，完全厌恶这种整个对话像在走钢丝的感觉。但她的内心深处，从花园带出来的那一小部分，觉得这一切似曾相识。

"Sorry," Shinji said, sounding like he genuinely meant it this time. "Guess I just... didn't think anyone would care once I left."  
"对不起，" 真嗣说，这次听起来他是真心实意的。"我猜我只是……没想到我离开后还会有人在乎。"

Asuka frowned. "Don't tell me you're sorry. It doesn't mean anything."  
明日香皱眉。“别跟我说你道歉了。那根本毫无意义。”

"Yeah... I guess not." “是啊……我想也是。”

"Oh, no one cares if I'm gone, poor me," she said in her best Shinji voice. "I forgot how dense you are." Like before, he held his tongue, that storm of resentment billowing in his expression again. Asuka flicked a hand through her hair, finding something of immense interest across the room. "She kept asking, you know. Until I told her I hadn't talked to you in months either."  
“哦，没人会在乎我是否离开，可怜的我，”她用最像真嗣的语气说道，“我忘了你有多迟钝。”就像之前一样，他保持沉默，表情中再次涌动着怨恨的风暴。明日香用手拨弄着头发，目光突然对房间另一头的某样东西产生了浓厚的兴趣。“她一直问，你知道的。直到我告诉她，我也已经好几个月没和你说话了。”

Shinji made a thoughtful noise. "Do you have her address still?"  
真嗣发出了一声沉思的声响。“你还有她的地址吗？”

"Yeah, why?" “有啊，怎么了？”

"I want to write her a letter."  
“我想给她写封信。”

"You're just writing it 'cause I told you to, and 'cause you feel guilty."  
"你只是因为我说了才写，而且因为你觉得内疚。"

"No... I miss her too."  
"不... 我也想念她。"

Asuka gave him a look that said _'what to do with you?_' without hope of an answer. "Would you ever do anything without someone to drag you by the collar?"  
明日香给了他一个眼神，仿佛在说‘拿你怎么办才好？’却并不期待答案。“没有人在后面拽着你的领子，你会做任何事吗？”

Shinji made an annoyed _tch_. "Yeah. I did plenty after _you_ left."  
真嗣发出了一声不悦的啧声。“是啊。你走后我做了不少事。”

Asuka found the simmering temper she'd held since entering the room fading into something else, like the heavy clouds of thought that had kept her in such a sour mood on the flight to Japan. She relived some of them in detail, for a flash. The hot needles of dismissal returned. "You seemed pretty busy. Hard to believe since you never did anything."  
明日香发现自己从进入房间起就一直压抑的怒火逐渐消散，取而代之的是如同笼罩在她心头许久的沉重思绪，这些思绪让她在飞往日本的航班上心情一直很糟糕。她短暂地重温了一些细节，那种被忽视的灼热刺痛感再次袭来。“你看起来挺忙的。很难相信，毕竟你从未做过什么。”

"I actually had other friends. It was nice."  
“我其实还有其他朋友。那种感觉很好。”

"Good. I got pretty tired of you following me around all the time. Like a sad little puppy. What kind of person stays in another country and only makes one friend?"  
"好。我真是受够了你一直跟着我转，像个可怜的小狗似的。什么样的人会待在别的国家，却只交一个朋友？"

"The kind who isn't allowed to leave," he said, an edge slipping into his tone.  
"那种不被允许离开的人，" 他的语气中带出了一丝锋芒。

"Yeah, whatever." "是啊，随便吧。"

Shinji played with the sheets in his hands, creasing them in his lap. "Asuka, what are you even talking to me for?"  
真嗣手里摆弄着床单，将其在膝上揉皱。“明日香，你到底为什么要跟我说话？”

Asuka didn't let her expression move, sliding an errant strand of hair behind an ear, lips pursing. At once it seemed an insurmountable task to divulge all that was on her mind. An undefined mess she couldn't possibly sift through in a word or two. Not even the smallest thread of it, the one that had brought her there to see that he was still in one piece, though she had no reason to believe otherwise. The words wouldn't come. Not in the way she wanted. No. She couldn't tell him that. "I got bored," she said, sighing. "They're still delivering my stuff and I don't want to go back to the Headquarters suite. There's nothing to do there."  
明日香没有让表情有任何变化，将一缕散乱的发丝拨到耳后，嘴唇微微抿起。一时间，似乎透露心中所想是一项难以逾越的任务。那是一团未定义的混乱，她不可能用一两句话就梳理清楚。甚至连其中最微小的线索，那个让她来到这里确认他依然安然无恙的线索，尽管她并没有理由怀疑这一点，也无法言明。那些话说不出口，不是她想要的方式。不，她不能告诉他。“我无聊了，”她叹了口气，“他们还在送我的东西，我不想回总部套房。那里没什么可做的。”

"Oh," he said softly, hands stilling. Was that disappointment? "Where are you staying?"  
“哦，”他轻声说道，手上的动作停了下来。那是失望吗？“你住在哪里？”

"Imperial Hotel." "帝国酒店。"

"No, I mean where are you going to be living?"  
"不，我是问你打算住在哪里？"

"Oh, I don't know." Her hand made a lazy swat to the side. "Somewhere in the GeoFront block, I think. Where do you stay?"  
"哦，我不确定。" 她的手懒洋洋地挥了一下。"我想是在地底都市区某处吧。你住哪儿？"

He nodded skyward. "In the city. Out in the valley by Gora."  
他朝天点了点头。“在城里。在戈拉山谷那边。”

"Where's that?" 那是哪里？

"It's up to the east, by Mount Myojogatake."  
“它在东边，靠近明城岳。”

"They let you live out there by yourself?"  
“他们让你一个人住在那儿？”

"No, I live with Misato. I can't stay on my own unless it's in the GeoFront block."  
"不，我和美里住在一起。除非是在 GeoFront 区，否则我不能独自居住。"

"That sucks. I can't wait to live on my own." That was only a bit of a lie. Actually, she was a little jealous that Shinji got to live with his guardian and she didn't. Kaji had often brushed off the topic of sharing space whenever she brought it up. It wasn't necessary for her to live with him, but she hated her extended family and none of them really seemed to like her either.  
"那真糟糕。我迫不及待想自己住了。" 这话说得有点违心。实际上，她对真嗣能和监护人住在一起感到一丝嫉妒，而她却没有。每次她提起同住的话题，加持总是敷衍了事。她不需要和他住在一起，但她讨厌她的大家族，而且他们似乎也不怎么喜欢她。

"It's okay," Shinji said with a bit of a smile. "Misato's kind of a slob, but I don't mind, I guess."  
"没事，" 真嗣带着一丝微笑说，"美里有点邋遢，但我想我并不介意。"

A smirk found her lips too. "You can't stand it. You used to almost cry if I left my socks on the floor." She could list all three incidents.  
她的唇边也浮现出一丝得意的笑。“你受不了这个。以前我只要把袜子落在地板上，你几乎都要哭出来。”她能列举出所有三次的情况。

"No I didn't…" he muttered, though his eyes said 'please don't bring that up', and she mercifully obliged. "But yeah, it's a bit annoying."  
“不，我没有……”他低声咕哝，尽管他的眼神在说‘请别提那件事’，而她仁慈地没有继续。“但确实，有点烦人。”

"So why don't you move out?"  
“那你为什么不搬出去呢？”

"I've thought about it, but…" she could see his mind shift, how it grappled against gray, heavy mountains weighing on his mind. He shook his head. "It's okay."  
"我考虑过，但是……" 她能看到他的思绪在转变，如何与压在心头的灰色沉重山峦搏斗。他摇了摇头。"没关系。"

"Idiot," she sighed, debating on whether or not to hit him in the arm. Now that she thought of it, he wouldn't stop fidgeting with it, or occasionally pinching his hand. She nodded with her chin. "What happened to your arm, anyway?"  
"傻瓜，" 她叹了口气，犹豫是否要打他的手臂。现在她想起来了，他一直在摆弄那只手臂，偶尔还会捏捏自己的手。她用下巴示意。"你的手臂到底怎么了？"

Shinji regarded it like he'd only just noticed. "Oh, this was from the last battle," he shrugged it for emphasis. "It's not broken or anything, they just don't want me using it too much. Ritsuko says I'm lucky there wasn't any permanent nerve damage. That can happen if your sync-ratio is high enough."  
真嗣看着手臂，好像刚刚才注意到。"哦，这是上次战斗留下的，" 他耸耸肩以示强调。"没断，只是他们不让我用太多。律子说我很幸运，没有造成永久性神经损伤。如果你的同步率足够高，这种事就可能发生。"

It could've happened today. "That still doesn't answer my question."  
这可能是今天发生的。“那还是没有回答我的问题。”

Shinji's gaze found its way into his lap again as he recounted, adopting the same hard, hollow stare that had possessed him before launch. "The Angel took out Rei. It was just me. The Eva was about ready to stall from all the damage. I crippled the Angel or something like that, so it was going to self-destruct and… I thought if I killed it before that, there wouldn't be an explosion. I had my hand around the core – trying to crush it. But I... I couldn't do it in time. The blast blew Unit-one's arm off while I was still connected." He took the right hand in his left, pressing a thumb into his palm.  
真嗣的目光再次落在了自己的膝盖上，他回忆着，眼神变得和之前出击时一样坚硬而空洞。“使徒击倒了绫波。只剩下我一个人。EVA 因为损伤过多快要停机了。我重创了使徒，或者类似的情况，所以它即将自爆……我想如果我在那之前消灭它，就不会有爆炸。我用手握住了核心——试图捏碎它。但我……没能及时做到。爆炸炸掉了初号机的一条手臂，而我当时还在连接中。”他用左手握住右手，用拇指按压着掌心。

A splinter of doubt told her maybe she shouldn't ask, but, "what about the First Child?"  
一丝疑虑告诉她也许不该问，但还是问了，“那第一适格者呢？”

"She's okay," he said, growing a little more subdued. "They just prioritized Unit-one's repairs over zero's. But at the time..." he let his thumb travel up each finger, making hers tingle with the idea of the sensation. "Sometimes I wake up and can't feel it there, even if I'm looking right at it and touching it."  
"她没事，" 他语气稍稍缓和了一些。"他们只是优先修复了一号机，零号机暂时搁置了。但当时……" 他让拇指沿着每根手指滑过，让她想象着那种感觉，手指微微发麻。"有时候我醒来，即使看着它，触摸着它，也感觉不到它的存在。"

"They didn't really mention that part in training." Asuka considered her battle, being face to face with a monster. Much to her chagrin, in a flash it felt like all the training in the world couldn't have prepared her for that. It had helped her deal with the pain when Gaghiel closed on her, kept her focused through the panic and terror that might have overwhelmed her otherwise, not that she thought that was very possible. But the fear had still been there. She wondered if it had been that way for Shinji during his first sortie. "I don't think it's such a big deal, though."  
"训练中他们并没有提到这部分。" 明日香回想起与怪物的正面交锋。令她懊恼的是，那一刻她觉得所有的训练都无法为她做好准备。当 Gaghiel 逼近时，训练帮助她应对了痛苦，让她在恐慌和恐惧中保持专注，尽管她认为这不太可能。但恐惧依然存在。她想知道真嗣在第一次出击时是否也有过类似的感觉。"不过，我觉得这没什么大不了的。"

She wasn't supposed to be afraid.  
她本不该感到害怕。

Shinji stared through the cieling. "I guess that's what Weissenberg meant… when he said there were some things he couldn't train me for."  
真嗣透过天花板凝视着。“我想这就是魏森伯格所说的……有些事情他无法训练我。”

Asuka hadn't thought about their old trainer in a while, and wondered when he had ever given Shinji such advice. She'd felt betrayed when the man finally left them. Just hearing his name had that feeling well up in her throat.  
明日香已经有一段时间没有想起他们的老教练了，她想知道他何时给过真嗣这样的建议。当那个人最终离开他们时，她感到被背叛了。只是听到他的名字，那种感觉就在她的喉咙里涌起。

Shinji did something odd then, sweeping those old thoughts away. His mouth trembled like he was about to laugh, before the amusement fled, or was pushed down. But then it happened again, faintly. "Hey," he said, "do you remember when you hit me with that rock? After I pushed you in the pond?"  
真嗣那时做了件奇怪的事，把那些旧念头一扫而空。他的嘴角颤抖着，好像要笑出来，但随即这种情绪消失了，或是被压抑了下去。但接着又轻微地发生了。“嘿，”他说，“你还记得你用那块石头打我的事吗？就在我把你推进池塘之后？”

Her face pinched, then she bolted upright. "Oh, yeah! I remember you cried!"  
她的脸一紧，随即猛地坐直。“哦，对了！我记得你当时哭了！”

He chuckled. "It hurt, _a lot_. I thought it was broken," he said, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "I think it's only a little crooked."  
他轻声笑道。“真的很疼，我以为它断了，”他边说边揉着鼻梁。“我觉得只是有点歪了。”

Asuka clicked her tongue. "Liar! It's just fine," she said, shaking her head. "God, I was so mad at you."  
明日香咂了咂舌。“骗子！明明就没事，”她摇头说道。“天啊，我当时真是气疯了。”

"You put, like, five bandaids on it, and you wouldn't stop telling me how it was my own fault."  
"你贴了大概五个创可贴，还不停地跟我说这是我自己活该。"

"Well it _was_. Boys aren't supposed to be mean to girls, _jerk_ – and I thought all the bandaids would help keep it in place." The last part she mumbled.  
""本来就是。男生不应该对女生刻薄，混蛋——我还以为多贴几个创可贴能固定住呢。"" 她最后那句咕哝着说。

"When was I ever mean to you?"  
"我什么时候对你刻薄过？"

Asuka crossed her arms and gave him a 'really?' sort of look. "All the time. Remember when we were digging and you stuffed dirt down my dress?"  
明日香交叉双臂，给了他一个‘真的吗？’的表情。“总是这样。记得我们挖东西的时候，你把土塞进我裙子里的事吗？”

He made a face at that. "Only because you shoved some in my face."  
他对此做了个鬼脸。“那只是因为你先往我脸上扔土。”

"Then you pulled my hair-"  
“然后你还扯了我的头发——”

"You kept kicking me, I didn't know how to make you stop."  
"你一直在踢我，我不知道怎么让你停下来。"

"It wasn't ever anything you didn't deserve," she said.  
""那都是你应得的，"" 她说。

He scratched at his collarbone. "Yeah, guess you're right."  
他挠了挠锁骨。""是啊，我想你是对的。"

Was she? It didn't feel like it. "Can you not tell when people are joking?"  
是吗？她没感觉到。“你难道看不出别人是在开玩笑吗？”

"No one jokes like that."  
“没人会那样开玩笑。”

"No one you know, which is like, three people."  
“你认识的人里没有，也就那么三个人。”

His eyes rolled. "Yeah, you know everything."  
他翻了个白眼。“是啊，你无所不知。”

"Yep, I do, so quit while you're ahead."  
“没错，我确实知道，所以见好就收吧。”

That, at least, seemed to bridge the gap enough for some bare form of appreciation to slip into his expression. Or, more likely, she was reading him wrong. All the same, her nerves melted. They kept talking until the GeoFront was a deep ocean blue, its artificial lights just starting to trickle to life, and she forgot all about the wolfdog and its lonely flower.  
至少这一点似乎足够弥合他们之间的隔阂，让他的表情中流露出些许感激之情。或者，更有可能是她误解了他。尽管如此，她的紧张情绪还是消散了。他们一直聊到地底都市变成了深海般的蓝色，人造灯光开始逐渐亮起，她完全忘记了那只孤狼和它那朵孤独的花。

---

Asuka had fallen asleep on the edge of the bed, head resting atop folded arms. Her hair was splayed out over the sheets from occasional shifting, mouth agape with blissful rest. Shinji lay curled up facing her, just as dead and dreaming to the world.  
明日香靠在床边睡着了，头枕在交叠的双臂上。她的头发因不时地挪动而散落在床单上，嘴角微张，沉浸在甜美的梦乡中。真嗣蜷缩着面对她躺着，同样对外界毫无知觉，沉浸在自己的梦境里。

In the hallway beyond, the doctors and nurses were consulting in whispers, all trying to peer in through the ajar door. Until Misato cleared her throat, making them jump and turnabout. "Let them be for now," she said, "they've had a long day."  
在走廊的另一头，医生和护士们正低声讨论着，都想透过半开的门窥视里面的情况。直到美里清了清嗓子，让他们吓了一跳，纷纷转身。“让他们暂时安静一会儿吧，”她说，“他们今天已经很累了。”

With only a few embarrassed glances and bowed heads, the staff dispersed, leaving her as the sole voyeur. She had come to talk to Shinji, even though it was absurd to even expect him to be up at this hour anyway. Maybe that's why she'd come so late. After meeting his med-evac at the hospital and following the ER staff to the ICU, she'd spent the rest of the afternoon wound tight with worry, thankful for the headache inducing distractions of post-battle. The following hours had given her time to stew over his disobedience, making her feel all the more at a loss. She'd been building up the courage to come by all day. Now a corded tension twisted itself from her core, shadowed with a sense of nostalgia.  
在几次尴尬的目光和低头的动作后，工作人员散去，留下她独自一人窥视。她本打算来找真嗣谈谈，尽管在这个时间点期待他还醒着本身就很荒谬。或许这就是她来得这么晚的原因。在医院见到他的医疗救援队，并跟随急诊室人员来到重症监护室后，她整个下午都紧绷着神经，为战后那些令人头痛的干扰感到庆幸。接下来的几个小时里，她一直在反思他的不服从，这让她更加感到无所适从。她一整天都在鼓起勇气来这里。现在，一股紧张的情绪从她的内心深处蔓延开来，夹杂着一丝怀旧的感觉。

The thought to take a picture of them together flitted across her mind, but she dismissed it as wrong somehow, catching them so vulnerable and unawares. Misato decided instead to take some of her own advice and left the two of them to their fatigued reunion. She'd tease them about it later. Or maybe she wouldn't.  
她脑海中闪过和他们合影的念头，但又觉得这样不妥，捕捉他们如此脆弱和无防备的状态。美里决定采纳自己的建议，让两人享受疲惫后的重逢。她以后会取笑他们。或者也许她不会。

---

When Asuka woke, bleary eyed and chin partly wet, the GeoFront beyond was dark, save for the glowing communes of workers stretched across crater filled forests. Her eyes stung, her breath stank and her skin felt heavy with sleep. The digital clock over Shinji's head read 23:09.  
当明日香醒来时，双眼朦胧，下巴部分湿润，地底都市之外一片漆黑，只有散布在坑洼森林中的工人聚居区发出微光。她的眼睛刺痛，呼吸中带着异味，皮肤因睡眠而感到沉重。挂在真嗣头顶的数字时钟显示着 23:09。

For a while, she sat in quiet and soft darkness, contemplating the sleeping Shinji with his bandaged arm tucked awkwardly beneath him. There were old nights when they'd slept in the same bed during German summers as children. But she wasn't a child anymore - neither of them were. He'd even said so himself.  
她静静地坐在柔和的黑暗中，凝视着熟睡的真嗣，他那包扎着的手臂尴尬地压在身下。曾经在德国的夏日，他们还是孩子时，有过同床共枕的夜晚。但她已不再是孩子了——他们都不再是。他自己也这么说过。

She eventually stood, sensing it was time to go but debating it all the same. Exhaustion peeled away at her mental checks, allowing foreign and unwanted ideas to slither into her skull. Embarrassed, even ashamed, Asuka stepped back, embittered over how easily his presence came to her. Thoughts of the olive tree and what was left there entered with him, as they always seemed to, and she wasn't sure whether or not she forgave him. Or even if she could. There was too much that had happened in a day, too much noise in her brain like a downpour over sheets of aluminum.  
最终，她站起身来，感觉到是时候离开了，尽管内心仍在犹豫。疲惫逐渐侵蚀她的心智防线，让那些不受欢迎的念头悄然潜入脑海。明日香感到尴尬甚至羞愧，她退后一步，对他轻易出现在自己心中的事实感到苦涩。橄榄树和那里遗留的一切，随着他的身影一同浮现，似乎总是如此，她不确定自己是否原谅了他，甚至不确定自己能否做到。一天之内发生了太多事，脑海中的噪音如同倾盆大雨打在铝板上般嘈杂。

So she slipped out to find her hotel up on the surface, leaving an empty chair in her place.  
于是她悄悄溜出去，寻找地表上的酒店，留下一把空椅子在原位。

**A/N:**

Yeah, so that interlude ended up not happening. Oh well. I know it's been quite a long wait, but I'd like to thank you for your patience anyway.  
是啊，那个插曲最终没有发生。算了。我知道已经等了很久，但还是想感谢你们的耐心。

I just want to cover some expectations going forward:  
我只想说明一下未来的期望：

The first is in regards to the Angels - we've seen all the old battles before and read dozens of variations of them thrice as much, _so as you've already noticed_, I've decided on reskinning the Angels and overhauling their abilities. Nothing terribly different in this chapter, but that will come with future chapters. Names will remain the same.  
首先关于使徒——我们已多次目睹那些旧战役，并阅读了数十种与之相似的变体，因此如你所见，我决定对使徒进行外观重塑并全面升级其能力。本章中并无太大变动，但后续章节将逐步展现。名称将保持不变。

I understand part of the appeal in reading an AU like this is seeing how the characters react differently to the same canon situations, but the Angels and battles themselves are there to reflect the internal and external struggles of the characters, so I thought it appropriate that since the characters are shaping up a bit differently, the challenges they face should reflect that.  
我理解阅读此类 AU 作品的部分吸引力在于观察角色如何对相同原作情境作出不同反应，但使徒与战斗本身旨在反映角色的内心与外在冲突，因此我认为既然角色们正以不同方式成型，他们面临的挑战也应体现这一点。

I also know that some of you may not have envisioned such a big time skip. I obviously can't please everyone nor do I aim to, but I'll attempt to relate my reasoning by stating that Asuka and Shinji are the basis for the conflict in this story, so for me, her transfer to NERV HQ was the logical starting point of Act II. Shinji's time in Tokyo-3 by himself and more of Asuka's personal life back at the estate will be explored in the following chapters.  
我也知道，你们中有些人可能未曾设想如此大的时间跳跃。我显然无法取悦所有人，也不以此为目标，但我会尝试通过说明来阐述我的理由：明日香和真嗣是本故事冲突的核心，因此对我而言，她转至 NERV 总部便是第二幕的合理起点。真嗣在第三新东京市独自度过的时光，以及明日香在庄园的私人生活，将在后续章节中展开探索。

Either way your comments and criticisms are welcome, as always.  
无论如何，一如既往地欢迎您的评论和批评。

### Chapter 2: Exile 流放
"I'm not sure what to do, Ritsuko. I've already chewed him out over the Fifth Angel but he just… closes up. And now this…" Misato tilted her head, free hand swirling the half-empty mug of coffee in front of her.  
“我不知道该怎么办，律子。我已经因为第五使徒的事训斥过他了，但他只是……封闭自己。现在又这样……”美里歪着头，空着的手搅动着面前半空的咖啡杯。

"He seems to be withdrawing," Ritsuko said, computer keys clacking in the background.  
"他似乎在退缩，" 律子说，电脑键盘的敲击声在背景中响起。

Misato rolled her eyes, throwing hair away from her face. "Tell me something I don't know."  
美里翻了个白眼，甩开脸上的头发。"告诉我一些我不知道的事。"

"The more you push him, the more he's going to disengage," she said in a sing-song fashion, "Isn't that what you called me about last time this happened?"  
"你越是逼他，他就越会脱离，" 她用一种唱歌般的语调说，"这不是上次发生这种情况时你打电话给我的原因吗？"

"You make it sound like a burden."  
"你把它说得像是个负担。"

There was a mild amusement from the other end. "Foisting your problems on others usually is, but I'm only making an observation."  
电话那头传来一丝轻微的笑意。""把你的问题推给别人通常就是如此，但我只是在陈述一个事实。""

Misato pushed her coffee away, crossing her legs. "What happened with the Fourth Angel was different."  
美里推开她的咖啡，翘起腿。""第四使徒那次情况不同。""

"I should think so. He was reprimanded by you and the Sub-Commander after the fact for the damages to Unit-one and zero."  
"我当然这么认为。他事后因为一号机和零号机的损坏被你和副司令训斥了一顿。"

"I only got on his case when he holed up in his room for a week." And Shinji hadn't said a word to her throughout that time either, but she couldn't share that – just the thought of it twisted up her resentment and hurt from buried places. If he had just listened to her. If he hadn't–  
"我只是在他把自己关在房间里一周后才找他谈话的。" 而那段时间碇真嗣一句话也没跟她说过，但她不能透露这一点——光是想到这个就让她埋藏的怨恨和伤痛纠结起来。如果他当时听了她的话。如果他没有——

"It wasn't as though he didn't show up for his responsibilities at NERV. Upset he didn't want to confide in you?"  
"他并不是没有履行在 NERV 的职责。他不想向你倾诉他的烦恼吗？"

"Shut up." "闭嘴。"

Quiet came over the line, allowing Misato a chance to glance at the metal chairs and tables littering the deserted patio just outside NERV HQ. She shifted and checked the watch head resting snug under her left wrist. It was about time to get going.  
电话那头安静下来，让美里有机会瞥了一眼 NERV 总部外荒废露台上散落的金属椅子和桌子。她挪了挪身子，检查了紧贴在左手腕下的手表。是时候该出发了。

"He needs to understand that his actions effect everyone, not just himself," she said, inspecting her nails.  
“他需要明白，他的行为影响着每一个人，不仅仅是他自己，”她说着，审视着自己的指甲。

"Maybe he already does," Ritsuko said, but Misato didn't pick her up on it and the stream of thought was left to wander down the wide river between them. The woman made a thoughtful noise. "But now that you mention it, I think that was also around the time my department started drafting a schedule for cross-compatibility tests with Unit-one and Rei."  
“也许他早已明白，”律子说，但美里没有接话，思绪便在他们之间的宽阔河流中游荡。律子发出了一声沉思的声响。“不过你这么一说，我想起来，大概也是那个时候，我的部门开始起草一号机和零号机交叉兼容测试的计划。”

Misato stood and pinched the phone between shoulder and ear, tying her red jacket around the waist. "What are you getting at?" she asked, leaving her mug and barely touched plate of noodles. A cafeteria worker would be along to pick it up.  
美里站起身，将手机夹在肩膀和耳朵之间，把红色夹克系在腰间。“你到底想说什么？”她问道，离开了自己的马克杯和几乎未动的面条盘。食堂工作人员会来收拾的。

"Look at his operational history so far," Ritsuko said, as though conducting one of her lectures, "in his first sortie against the Third Angel, a proving of his competence, he wasn't the one to kill it. It was Rei. Now take that into consideration with his last two battles and a pattern starts to become evident. It might look reckless on the surface, but consider that he's trying to be competent. More than that, he's trying to be self-sufficient."  
“看看他迄今为止的作战记录，”律子说道，仿佛在进行她的讲座，“在他第一次迎战第三使徒，证明自己能力的战斗中，他并非击杀使徒的那个人。是绫波。现在结合他最近两次战斗的情况，一种模式开始显现。表面上看起来可能很鲁莽，但考虑到他试图证明自己的能力。不仅如此，他还在努力实现自给自足。”

Misato grimaced, acknowledging security personnel with silent nods as she walked. Was he? She tried to imagine him thinking that way. Misato knew it was important to him, knew how seriously he took his responsibility to pilot. But... did she really? She'd know him since he was just a boy trying to figure out who it was he was supposed to be fighting. After all that time, she still misstepped, still misread him. As of the last month, she felt like she didn't know him at all.  
美里面露难色，在行走中向安保人员默默点头致意。他真的在这样想吗？她试图想象他那样思考的样子。美里知道这对他很重要，知道他对待驾驶的责任有多么认真。但是...她真的了解吗？自从他还是个试图弄清楚自己应该与谁战斗的男孩时，她就认识他了。尽管经历了那么长时间，她仍然会出错，仍然会误解他。就在上个月，她感觉自己完全不了解他了。

"I suppose," she admitted, barely, "but I thought he liked Rei, and now with Asuka here… I don't get that either. Ristuko, they were inseparable a few years back."  
"我想，"她勉强承认，"但我觉得他喜欢丽，现在明日香来了……我也不明白。理津子，他们几年前可是形影不离的。"

"I'm afraid I can't help you with that one. Whatever the issue is, they're going to have to be able to work together."  
"恐怕在这件事上我帮不了你。无论问题是什么，他们都必须能够合作。"

"I know. I can't have any more incidents like the last battle."  
"我知道。我不能再发生像上次战斗那样的意外了。"

"That would be nice. From what I understand, the Americans are appealing to the UN Committee for reparations due to the loss of their prototype accelerator."  
"那会很好。据我所知，美国人正在向联合国委员会申请赔偿，因为他们失去了原型加速器。"

Misato clicked her tongue. "They're just upset they can't outfit their new Zumwalts with it. They'd be skirting the Valentines Treaty anyway, so I did them a favor."  
美里咂了咂舌。“他们只是因为不能用它来装备他们的新朱姆沃尔特级而感到沮丧。无论如何，他们都会违反瓦伦丁条约，所以我算是帮了他们一个忙。”

"That's not how the DOD sees it. Truthfully, I think you're lucky to still have a job."  
"国防部可不是这么看的。说实话，我觉得你能保住工作已经很幸运了。"

That gave Misato an unpleasant gut-drop. "Don't worry, I was given a not-so-subtle warning by the Sub-Commander during my after-action report." Just the memory of it had her reddening with embarrassment and no small amount of fury. It had been a long time since she'd been dressed down like that by a CO.  
"这让美里感到一阵不快的胃部下沉。“别担心，我在战后报告中被副司令给了个不那么微妙的警告。”仅仅是回忆起这件事就让她脸红并带着不小的愤怒。已经很久没有被指挥官这样训斥过了。”

She boarded an escalator that would take her to the parking levels, shifting the phone to her other ear while Ritsuko spoke with someone on the other side. "By the way, I wanted to tell you," she said after they'd gone, "Shinji's sync-rate jumped to sixty-two percent during his last sortie. It isn't much, but better than what he's been doing."  
"她登上自动扶梯，前往停车层，同时将电话换到另一只耳朵，而那边律子正在和某人交谈。“顺便说一下，我想告诉你，”她们说完后，她说道，“真嗣在上一次出击中同步率跃升至六十二个百分点。虽然不多，但比他之前的表现要好。””

"Doesn't he have a median sync-rate of seventy-two?" she asked.  
“他的平均同步率不是七十二个百分点吗？”她问道。

"Yes, that's his average. Recently it's been declining. As of the last test, his median rate fell to fifty-nine percent. That's a thirteen-point decrease without any spikes in a month."  
"是的，那是他的平均水平。最近有所下降。根据上次测试，他的中位数率跌至百分之五十九。这是一个十三点的下降，且在一个月内没有任何峰值。"

Misato leaned against the rubber rails, brow tight. For as long as she'd known him Shinji's scores had only ever increased, with small fluctuations here and there. Based on what Ritsuko had said earlier, she'd put a sure bet on such a sharp decline starting after his first battle. Was that it? Had she been so caught up in everything at headquarters once the Angels finally returned, that she'd missed… whatever this was?  
美里靠在橡胶栏杆上，眉头紧锁。自从她认识真嗣以来，他的分数只增不减，偶尔有些小波动。根据律子之前所说，她本以为这种急剧下降会在他第一次战斗后开始。难道是那样吗？她是否因为天使终于回归后总部的一切事务而忙得不可开交，以至于错过了……这个情况？

"Do you think that's because of Asuka? Not the decrease, but from a couple days ago."  
"你觉得这是因为明日香吗？不是指下降，而是从几天前开始。"

"Hard to say. It's within the realm of possibility," she said, reluctant.  
“很难说。这并非不可能，”她不情愿地说。

Misato stepped off at a busy terminal, her gait slower than before as she searched for her car in the massive underground lot. The feeling wasn't unlike walking into a room and completely forgetting what she came in for. "You know he hasn't made any friends since moving here. Except for Rei, that is. I mean, sure, he talks to some of the kids at school, but I don't think any of them are his friends."  
美里在一个繁忙的航站楼下了车，她的步伐比之前慢了许多，在庞大的地下停车场中寻找她的车。这种感觉就像走进一个房间却完全忘记了进来是为了什么。“你知道他搬到这里后就没交过什么朋友。除了绫波，也就是了。我是说，当然，他和学校里的一些孩子聊过天，但我觉得他们中没有一个是他的朋友。”

That received a dismissive hum. "Boys – men – are solitary creatures, generally speaking. They don't form social circles the same way girls do."  
这番话引来了一声不以为然的哼声。“一般来说，男孩——或者说男人——是独来独往的生物。他们不像女孩那样形成社交圈子。”

Annoyance plucked her. "Well, how about _no_ social circles? Like, at all – and at his age?" she snapped, sighing and allowing herself a moment to calm. Her friend patiently obliged. Eventually, she reached her car and started with another sigh. "I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want to try after what happened at his old school." That, and the incident with that boy a few weeks ago.  
"恼怒之情袭上心头。“好吧，那如果完全没有社交圈子呢？就像，完全不参与——而且在他这个年纪？”她厉声说道，叹了口气，让自己稍作平静。她的朋友耐心地听着。最终，她走到自己的车前，又叹了口气。“我不知道。也许他不想尝试，毕竟他以前的学校发生了那样的事。”还有几周前和那个男孩的冲突。”

"That would make sense. Shinji is a conscientious boy, after all. What he's been given is a harsh responsibility." For a moment there was a quiet, if not fleeting, sympathy in her voice.  
“那样的话，说得通。毕竟，真嗣是个有责任心的孩子。他所承担的责任确实沉重。”有那么一会儿，她的声音里流露出虽短暂却真切的同情。

"Thanks, that makes me feel much better, Ritsuko."  
“谢谢，这样我好受多了，律子。”

"I didn't say it to make you feel better. It's a difficult burden these children have to bear, but what else can we do?"  
“我这么说不是为了让你感觉好些。这些孩子必须承受的重担确实艰难，但我们还能做什么呢？”

Misato found her car, clambering in and slamming the door shut. Her key found the ignition. "I know… listen, I gotta' go. I'll talk to you later." They traded goodbyes and for a while Misato simply sat forward in her car, arms resting on the steering wheel.  
美里找到了她的车，爬进去后用力关上车门。钥匙找到了点火器。“我知道……听着，我得走了。晚点再聊。”他们互道再见，美里在车里静静地坐了一会儿，双臂搭在方向盘上。

When had everything started spiraling out of her control? It wasn't just the ever-mounting pile of overdue construction reports for repairs they couldn't pay for, or the constant complaints of overworked labor personnel, or the never-ending pining regarding departments that were over-budget and under-funded. All of that she could handle, though it felt less and less like she could stomach another civil defense assessment that month, it wasn't so bad as long as they still had the Evas. That was all that really mattered. So long as the city was still there, everything else was alright, and now they had Unit-02 and Asuka. That should have taken at least some of the weight from her, but all she could think about was the next battle. Even dreaded it. It was the third time now Shinji had disobeyed a direct order.  
一切是从何时开始失控的？不仅仅是日益堆积的逾期建筑维修报告，他们无力支付这些费用，或是劳工人员对超负荷工作的持续抱怨，还有那些预算超支、资金不足的部门无休止的哀叹。这些她都能应付，尽管那个月她越来越难以忍受再进行一次民防评估，但只要他们还有 EVA，一切都不算太糟。这才是真正重要的。只要城市还在，其他一切都还好，现在他们有了 02 号机和明日香。这本应减轻她的负担，但她满脑子都是下一场战斗。甚至害怕它。这是真嗣第三次违抗直接命令了。

Gehirn's Krypteia Program had always seemed workable, when she didn't think about it very hard. That wasn't difficult, not when she'd been hot off dropping out of college and breaking up with a boyfriend she intended never to see again, intent to prove herself in the military and make herself someone who could fight the Angels when they returned. She knew they would. Misato might not have understood what exactly had happened to her during Second Impact, not back then, but she knew it wasn't over. It was only a matter of time. When she made it out of boot she'd been set on a steady path from her stumbling journey out of teendom. Stopped fucking around and grew up.  
大脑的克律提亚计划在她不深思时总是显得可行。这并不难，毕竟那时她刚从大学退学，与一个她决心再也不见的男友分手，一心要在军队中证明自己，成为能在使徒回归时与之战斗的人。她知道他们会回来的。Misato 可能当时并不完全明白第二次冲击期间她经历了什么，但她知道那并未结束。只是时间问题。从新兵训练营出来后，她踏上了一条稳定的道路，摆脱了青春期的跌跌撞撞。不再胡闹，真正成熟了。

So it stood to reason that experience would do the same for anyone else, right? She'd made her way in a broken world and been put in a position to guide someone else through it. To make them competent and able.  
因此，经验对其他人也应该有同样的效果，对吧？她在一个破碎的世界中找到了自己的位置，并被置于引导他人穿越这个世界的位置。使他们变得能干和有能力。

What better way to do it than when they were young?  
还有什么比在他们年轻时更好的方式来做到这一点呢？

She'd watched him grow. Helped him learn. Seen him triumph and fail. Even when she was off in Tokyo-2 and later NERV Hakone, being groomed for a position with the command staff through her service with the JSSDF and the UN, she would think of him – even if it was only fleeting. He'd always been a serious and insular boy, but at least buoyant in a way she came to like. The more he learned, and the more he fought, the more the image of that boy faded – struggling to surface in moments of childish displays.  
她见证了他的成长，助他学习，目睹他成功与失败。即便她在东京-2，后来在 NERV 箱根，通过在自卫队和联合国的服役被培养为指挥层的一员，她仍会想起他——哪怕只是转瞬即逝。他一直是个严肃而内向的男孩，但至少在某种程度上让她喜欢。他学得越多，战斗得越多，那个男孩的形象就越发模糊——在孩童般的瞬间挣扎着浮现。

Shinji didn't smile much anymore.  
真嗣已经很少笑了。

If she'd paid attention, maybe she would have seen this coming. Could have done something to stop it.  
如果她当时多加留意，或许就能预见到这一切。本可以做些什么来阻止。

Huffing through her nose, steeling herself, she rolled out of the parking garages beneath headquarters and glided onto highway 52 towards the medical wards in the mountains. When she got there Shinji was out front, lying on one of the shaded benches with his back to the road and wearing the last thing she'd seen him in – his NERV uniform. From where she was, he might have been mistaken for some homeless veteran and it was earning him some curious and even scathing looks from passersby. The uniform was likely the only thing keeping them at bay, including the officer standing down on the corner, contemplating whether or not to approach. Blinking, Misato brushed the idea away and pumped her horn. He must have been tired, laying out there like that.  
她鼻息沉重，鼓起勇气，从总部地下的停车场驶出，滑上通往山区医疗区的 52 号高速公路。到达那里时，真嗣正躺在前面的一个阴凉长椅上，背对着道路，穿着她最后一次见他时的衣服——他的 NERV 制服。从她的位置看，他可能会被误认为是一个无家可归的老兵，这让他收到了一些好奇甚至尖刻的目光。制服可能是唯一让他们保持距离的东西，包括站在角落的警官，正在考虑是否要接近。眨了眨眼，美里打消了这个念头，按响了喇叭。他一定很累，那样躺在那里。

The boy's head perked up and, with more energy than she would have guessed, gathered his things and came 'round to the side of her car. He clambered in and they exchanged hellos. Warmth eased over them as she pulled out onto the streets. Right away he popped his earbuds in and took to staring out the window. Her mouth tightened.  
男孩的头抬了起来，比她预想的更有活力，他收拾好东西，绕到她的车旁。他爬进车里，他们互相打了个招呼。当她驶上街道时，温暖在他们之间蔓延。他立刻塞上耳塞，开始凝视窗外。她的嘴角紧绷。

"Hey, how's the arm?" she asked, trying to sound perky and upbeat. Something other than deflated.  
“嘿，手臂怎么样了？”她问道，试图听起来活泼乐观，而不是泄气。

She was allotted a glance. "Hm? Oh, it's okay." Then it was back to the window.  
她只得到了一瞥。“嗯？哦，没事。”随后目光又回到了窗外。

Misato concealed a grimace. "Take your medication?"  
美里掩饰住一丝不悦。“吃药了吗？”

"Yeah." "嗯。"

Metal rattled in a tall shaft along the GeoFront wall, her Renault bouncing as she rolled onto a rail car platform. Squeals echoed through the glass from other trains coming and going. Misato crossed her arms as they waited to ascend. Maple gold afternoon started to pour in through the ceiling shafts high above. It would be rush hour by the time they made it topside.  
金属在 GeoFront 墙边的长井中叮当作响，她的雷诺车随着她滚上轨道车平台而颠簸。其他列车来来往往的尖锐声响透过玻璃回荡。美里交叉双臂，他们等待着上升。枫金色下午的阳光开始从高高的天花板井口倾泻而下。等他们到达地面时，将是交通高峰期。

"So, you got to talk to Asuka, right?" Misato asked, as though she hadn't been thinking the question for the past fifteen minutes and simply waiting to ask.  
“所以，你和明日香聊过了，对吧？”美里问道，仿佛她不是在过去十五分钟里一直在思考这个问题，而只是刚刚才想起来要问。

"Yeah." "嗯。"

She barely held back a sigh. "Well, how is she?"  
她几乎忍不住叹了口气。“那么，她怎么样了？”

Shinji shot her a glare. "Why don't you ask her?"  
真嗣瞪了她一眼。“你为什么不直接问她？”

"Sure," she said, shifting in her seat. Her spine had gone rigid. "Just thought it would be nice to hear it from you, jerk." She slapped the power button on her center console, turning the radio on. Some 80s station filled the car. She recognized Anri's voice. The woman sang for a few minutes without interruption.  
"当然，"她回答，挪了挪座位。她的脊背已经僵硬。"只是觉得听你亲口说会好些，混蛋。"她拍了一下中控台的电源键，打开了收音机。某个 80 年代的电台充满了车厢。她听出了 Anri 的声音。这位女士唱了几分钟，没有被打断。

"Sorry," Shinji said, staring down at his lap. "I just don't really want to talk about it right now."  
"对不起，"真嗣说，低头盯着他的大腿。"我只是现在不太想谈这个。"

She felt her features soften. "How come?"  
她感到自己的表情柔和了下来。"为什么呢？"

"I don't know. Just don't."  
"我不知道。只是别这样。"

Guard rails shot up along the edges of the train beds, a buzzer signaling their imminent departure. A low whine began to rise around them as it lurched forward and, picking up speed, the beds began to jostle beneath them.  
轨道边缘迅速升起了护栏，蜂鸣器预示着它们即将出发。随着列车向前一冲，低沉的嗡嗡声开始在周围升起，随着速度的加快，床铺也开始在它们下方摇晃。

"I don't get it; you guys were always so close. Asuka used to throw a tantrum if we ever pulled you apart for training. Now I can't even put you in the same room without getting attitude," she said, at first to her windshield, pausing a moment to watch him. "Hm?"  
"我不明白；你们以前总是那么亲密。明日香以前要是我们把你们分开训练，她就会发脾气。现在我甚至不能把你们放在同一个房间里，否则就会遭到冷眼，"她一开始对着挡风玻璃说，停顿了一下看着他。"嗯？"

He shrugged, silently grasping for words. "We just… didn't want to be friends anymore."  
他耸了耸肩，默默地寻找着合适的词句。“我们只是……不想再做朋友了。”

"And what about now?" “那现在呢？”

"I don't know," he said, finding the window again, as if he might discover an answer out in the dimly lit corridor. A wellspring of emotions coiled about her then, and she couldn't decide which she should attack first – so she didn't.  
“我不知道，”他说着，目光再次投向窗外，仿佛在那昏暗的走廊上能找到答案。那一刻，她心中涌动着复杂的情感，不知该先面对哪一种——于是她什么也没做。

"Well, you're going to have to be friends," she said, adopting her soldier's tone. The only one that seemed able to reach him anymore. "What happened last battle isn't going to fly anymore. I need you two to be able to work together now that you're co-pilots."  
"好吧，你们得成为朋友，" 她用上了她的战士口吻，这是唯一能再次触动他的方式。"上次战斗中的事不能再发生了。既然你们现在是共同驾驶员，我需要你们能够合作。"

Shinji made a small, derisive noise, refusing to face her.  
真嗣发出了一声轻微的嘲讽声，拒绝面对她。

"You hear me?" "你听到了吗？"

"_Yes_." "是的。"

The space between them was overwhelmed by the clacking of the rails and the soft tones of Anri singing. Red light washed over them at intervals, German summer festivals carried in the smooth beats. Misato washed a hand through her long hair, reflections flaring over her legs.  
他们之间的空间被铁轨的咔嗒声和安里柔和的歌声淹没。红色灯光不时洒在他们身上，德国夏日节日的节奏在平稳的节拍中传递。美里用手梳理着长发，倒影在她腿上闪烁。

"Hey," she said, hoping to catch his eyes. She leaned forward, but he was stubborn if nothing else. "I was worried about you."  
“嘿，”她说，希望能吸引他的目光。她向前倾身，但他固执得无可救药。“我很担心你。”

She saw it in his shoulders, in his posture, the way he continued to bore into the passing city blocks. _I don't believe you_, they said, and that hit her harder than any word he might have uttered. Misato left the conversation as it was, feeling more dissatisfied with the wound between her and her charge than before.  
她从他的肩膀、姿势中看出，他继续凝视着掠过的城市街区。我不相信你，这些无声的话语比任何说出口的话都更让她心痛。美里任由对话停留在那里，感觉自己与她的监护对象之间的裂痕比之前更加难以释怀。

---

Already fifteen minutes had passed and she still didn't know what to do with the pair of orange sapphire earrings in her palm, sitting there like two tiny flames.  
已经过去了十五分钟，她仍然不知道该如何处理手中那对橙色蓝宝石耳环，它们静静躺在掌心，宛如两簇微小的火焰。

Her studio apartment glowed with the light of morning bouncing off the GeoFront dome. The white, pristine surfaces of her walls, tables and appliances caught it with ease. An array of packing boxes, some half-open and contents spilled out across the floor, were the only indicator the place was at all lived in. The sapphires in her palm bristled.  
她的工作室公寓在早晨阳光的反射下，因 GeoFront 穹顶的映照而熠熠生辉。墙壁、桌子和电器洁白无瑕的表面轻松地捕捉到了这光芒。唯一表明这里有人居住的迹象是一排半开的包装箱，里面的物品散落一地。她手中的蓝宝石耳环似乎也感到了不安。

A digital clock chirped, her fourth snooze alarm sounding. She checked her watch again. _Tick-tick-tick_. With a groan she dumped the earrings back in her jewelry box and shoved it away.  
数字时钟发出鸣叫，这是她第四次按下贪睡闹钟。她再次查看手表。滴答滴答。她呻吟一声，将耳环扔回首饰盒，然后推到一旁。

Asuka made sure she had her key-card before she left and, on her way to the shuttles that would take her to the skyward trams, checked her phone. Waiting there was a message from Kaji asking her to check in and she did so, with hearts and exclamation points. Her thoughts pitter-pattered on him all the way to the surface level terminals, where music from Kismet played over the speakers. She found herself humming the tune, as she had when her step-mother filled their house with the scratch of old LPs and swayed side to side in a dance called Calypso.  
明日香确保自己带上了钥匙卡才离开，前往接驳车途中，她检查了手机。那里有一条加持发来的消息，让她报个平安，她照做了，用上了心形符号和感叹号。她的思绪一路上都在他身上跳跃，直到抵达地表层终端，那里播放着《奇缘》的音乐。她发现自己哼着那首曲子，就像继母用老唱片的刮擦声填满他们的家时那样，左右摇摆着跳起了名为卡利普索的舞蹈。

Tokyo-3 was a different city in the morning, loud and full of life like Heidelberg had been. Everything and everyone moved in a disjointed concert and the streets were crawling with other students off to their respective schools.  
清晨的第三新东京市是另一番景象，喧闹而充满生机，如同海德堡一般。万物与众人在这不协调的合奏中移动，街道上挤满了赶往各自学校的学生。

A glance at her watch.  
她瞥了一眼手表。

Koi fish wriggled their way down a drainage canal by her feet and she watched them sway. They reminded her again of Shinji, as everything seemed to since she arrived. Inexplicable things like a sound or a smell, or a voice.  
鲤鱼在她脚边的排水渠中扭动着游走，她注视着它们摇摆的身姿。自从她来到这里，一切似乎都在提醒她想起真嗣，无法解释的事物，比如一个声音或一种气味，又或是一个声音。

Or a fish. 或是一条鱼。

And there he was, brought into her mind's eye.  
就这样，他的形象浮现在她的脑海中。

On one of her visits to the estate, back when Shinji had gone for good, Asuka once stood outside his old apartment in the garden, a mere foot away from the ponds. She'd been trying to throw the earrings in with the koi, who had only recently disappeared, swallowed whole by greedy herons. It took an hour for her to finally give it up and go back inside.  
在她造访庄园的某次，那时真嗣已经永远离开，明日香曾站在花园里他旧居的门外，仅一步之遥便是池塘。她试图将耳环扔给那些锦鲤，它们不久前才消失无踪，被贪婪的白鹭整个吞食。她花了整整一个小时才最终放弃，返回屋内。

That pond had been a sacred place, as silly as it was to think of it that way. There wasn't any other form she could give it. Calm. Peace. A place she could read from her mother's library and fall into another world. She remembered some mornings, Shinji would wake up early to read with her, their knees touching on the big boulder out by the pond.  
那池塘曾是神圣之地，尽管这么想有些可笑。她无法用其他形式来形容它。宁静。平和。一个她能从母亲的书房中阅读并沉浸于另一个世界的地方。她记得有些清晨，真嗣会早起与她一起阅读，他们的膝盖在池塘边的大石头上相触。

She used to like reading. When Asuka was growing up her mother's bookshelves were full of love stories and romance novels. It was one of the few things that was left of her after she died. Her father said she wasn't old enough to read them, but that hadn't stopped her from sneaking them into her room, part of her hoping he would catch her. Another doing it because he had forbidden it.  
她曾经喜欢阅读。在明日香成长的过程中，母亲的书架上满是爱情故事和浪漫小说。这是她去世后留给她的少数东西之一。她父亲说她还没到读这些书的年纪，但这并未阻止她偷偷将它们带进房间，一方面希望他会发现，另一方面则是因为他禁止她这么做。

But if those stories had taught her anything, it was to never be a woman like those from the oil paintings and books. Like the legend about Hippocrates' daughter, who was transformed into a hundred-foot long dragon by the envious goddess Diane, forced to dwell in an old castle and called the Lady of the Manor. She emerged three times a year and, if a knight should kiss her, would be turned back into a woman, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands.  
但这些故事教会她一件事，那就是永远不要成为那些油画和书籍中的女人。就像希波克拉底女儿的传说，她被嫉妒的黛安娜女神变成了一条百尺长的龙，被迫居住在一座古老的城堡中，被称为庄园夫人。她每年出现三次，如果有骑士亲吻她，她就会变回女人，让那位骑士成为她的伴侣和岛屿的统治者。

Various knights tried, but all fled when they saw the hideous dragon, dying some horrible death soon after. There was one who, knowing nothing of the dragon, came to the castle she inhabited – finding her in her human form. But he was no knight, and his kiss would not break the spell, and she told him so. He ventured to the Hospitallers and passed their trials, returning a full-fledged knight. But upon seeing the woman in her monstrous form cried out, and even he fled.  
许多骑士尝试过，但当他们看到那可怕的龙时，全都逃跑了，不久后都死于某种可怕的命运。有一个人，对龙一无所知，来到了她居住的城堡——发现她以人形出现。但他不是骑士，他的吻无法打破咒语，她这样告诉他。他冒险前往医院骑士团并通过了他们的考验，回来时已成为一名正式骑士。但当他看到她那怪物般的形态时，惊叫起来，甚至他也逃跑了。

Why had Diane turned her into a dragon? Why did the knights seek her? Why did they flee? Why did she have to rely on a kiss to set her free?  
为什么黛安娜要把她变成龙？为什么骑士们要寻找她？为什么他们会逃跑？为什么她必须依靠一个吻来获得自由？

It didn't make sense to Asuka then, and still didn't now. Those things had no place in her world, not anymore. That old garden was gone, and so were the fish. She never wanted to see it again so long as she lived.  
那时对明日香来说毫无意义，现在依然如此。那些东西已不再属于她的世界。那个旧花园消失了，鱼儿们也不见了。只要她还活着，就再也不想见到它。

She didn't need it anymore.  
她不再需要它了。

Confidently, she strode on – a smile creeping over her face, a perk in her step. She checked her watch, stifling some annoyance at being behind.  
她自信地大步前行——脸上渐渐露出微笑，步伐也轻快起来。她看了看手表，对落后感到些许不悦。

---

It was something he could feel right away, deep down to his feet. Strong enough to be annoyed with as he sat at the kitchen table, yet undefined enough to be completely puzzled by. His pulse was okay, his arm felt alright – he didn't have to wear it in a sling anymore. There wasn't anything in particular he had to do today either, other than attend school. No sync tests at NERV and no actual tests worth noting. Pen Pen was still by his chair, chomping away on breakfast.  
这是一种他立刻就能深切感受到的感觉，直抵脚底。强烈到让他坐在餐桌前都感到烦躁，却又模糊到完全令人困惑。他的脉搏正常，手臂感觉也不错——他不再需要用吊带固定了。今天也没有什么特别的事情要做，除了上学。NERV 没有同步测试，也没有值得一提的实际测试。Pen Pen 依然在他的椅子旁，大口吃着早餐。

"What kind of genetically altered penguin can't get their own breakfast?" He asked. The creature glanced up at him with dismissive, beady eyes. Shinji sipped from his tea.  
“什么样的基因改造企鹅连自己的早餐都搞不定？”他问道。那生物不屑地用小眼睛瞥了他一眼。真嗣啜了一口茶。

His mornings would never be the same. He wasn't sure how he knew that, especially since he woke like he always did to the same alarm clock, the same ceiling and the same stumbling slog from bed to shower, fresh clothes in tow. It pervaded everything in his space, as loud and encompassing as the summer cicadas, which seemed determined to sing their songs into Misato's apartment.  
他的早晨再也不会一样了。他不确定自己是怎么知道的，尤其是因为他像往常一样醒来，听到同样的闹钟，看到同样的天花板，拖着刚换上的干净衣服从床走到淋浴间。这种感觉充斥着他周围的一切，就像夏日的蝉鸣一样响亮而无处不在，似乎决心要将它们的歌声传入美里小姐的公寓。

Shinji dumped what was left of his tea, shouldered his school bag and told Pen Pen he'd see him later. Then he was out the door and setting foot into the sweltering heat. As he set his SDAT to play, Miki Matsubara's voice started dancing in his ears. He looked at the old player like it'd morphed into a dead fish, and stood there for a moment while it ran, a few cars revving by. This track never played. He didn't let it. The song became distorted and far away as he yanked the buds from his ears and let them hang from his neck.  
真嗣倒掉剩下的茶，背上书包，告诉 Pen Pen 待会儿见。随后他便出了门，踏入闷热之中。当他将 SDAT 播放器打开，Miki Matsubara 的歌声开始在耳边跳跃。他看着那老旧的播放器，仿佛它变成了一条死鱼，站在那里片刻，几辆车呼啸而过。这首曲子从未播放过。他不允许。随着他将耳机从耳中猛地拽出，挂在脖子上，歌声变得扭曲而遥远。

Shinji walked half a mile down a narrow road, reaching a sprawling train station that encroached over the buildings around it like a silver-coated weed. People bunched along the platforms, while men dressed like officers patrolled the edges. The route he needed was underground, a network of domed corridors held up on wide chrome pillars and filled with the hollow slaps of shoes and dry murmur of voices.  
真嗣沿着狭窄的马路走了半英里，来到一个蔓延的火车站，它像镀银的杂草一样侵占着周围的建筑。人们聚集在站台上，而身穿制服的男子在边缘巡逻。他需要的路线在地下，一系列穹顶走廊由宽大的镀铬柱子支撑，充满了鞋跟的空洞拍打声和干涩的低语声。

He passed through a bustling gate, piling in with dozens of others as a train whined into its berth. A surge of people flowed onto the platform, pushing past the waiting horde, who were already pushing to fill the open spaces before the train's departure. Shinji made it in last, grabbing onto a handrail. Beside him a girl, probably a high-schooler, leaned against the door, dressed in a red plaid skirt with a plain white shirt and gray cardigan two sizes too big. Pink headphones hung from her ears.  
他穿过一个熙熙攘攘的检票口，与数十人一同挤上了一辆正缓缓驶入站台的列车。人群如潮水般涌向站台，推挤着那些早已在等待的人群，他们争先恐后地填补列车出发前的空隙。真嗣最后才挤了进去，抓住一根扶手。他身旁是一个女孩，大概是个高中生，靠在车门上，穿着一条红色格子裙，搭配一件简单的白色衬衫和一件大两号的灰色开衫。粉色的耳机挂在她耳边。

For Shinji, there was really only one thing to do when he started his new life in Tokyo-3: stop taking everyone so seriously; establish a proper distance between himself and everything else. Forget about bright morning roses and plaid skirts. It was an easy enough promise to keep when it was just him, Misato, and the penguin in their apartment.  
对真嗣来说，当他开始在第三新东京市的新生活时，只有一件事要做：别再对每个人都那么认真；与周围的一切保持适当的距离。忘掉那些明媚的晨间玫瑰和格子裙吧。当只有他和美里还有那只企鹅在公寓里时，这个承诺很容易遵守。

Then he was enrolled in the Tokyo-3 south-east side junior high school, thrown to the wolves and expected to learn how to survive. He'd done that already. But unlike the _Kloster_, where he was simply out of the norm, everyone here wanted to know about him, the unusual transfer student from Germany who was also Japanese – an enigma. Even living in a Japanese style home with a Japanese Teacher, he'd spent so long in Germany that he ended up stepping on everyone's toes whatever he did.  
随后，他被安排进入东京-3 东南侧的初中就读，置身于狼群之中，被期望学会生存之道。他早已习得此技。但与克洛斯特不同，在那里他只是与众不同，而这里每个人都想了解他——这位来自德国的日本转学生，一个谜一般的存在。尽管与一位日本教师同住在一所日式住宅中，他在德国生活了太久，以至于无论做什么都会触犯他人。

The Germans had formal ways of addressing people, but at least they were direct. Most Japanese were formal, exceedingly polite and insisted on beating around the bush for minutes before the entire purpose of the conversation was reached. Then there was the bowing. He understood it, had practiced it when interacting with Teacher, but the appropriateness of use utterly escaped him in every situation. He bowed when it wasn't warranted, or forgot to when it absolutely was, and barely participated when bowing extended beyond a brief exchange between stations of hierarchy.  
德国人有正式的称呼方式，但至少他们直截了当。大多数日本人则非常正式，极其礼貌，坚持绕圈子几分钟才触及对话的真正目的。还有鞠躬。他理解这一点，在与教师互动时也练习过，但在各种情况下何时鞠躬完全让他摸不着头脑。他不该鞠躬时鞠了，该鞠躬时又忘了，当鞠躬超出了等级间简短交流的范畴时，他几乎无法参与其中。

Then there were the little things like learning to not walk around while eating his food, refusing a request and causing someone embarrassment, remembering shoes were taken off everywhere, and using last names for absolutely everyone.  
然后就是一些小事，比如学会不在吃东西时走来走去，拒绝请求而不让对方难堪，记得在任何地方都要脱鞋，以及对所有人使用姓氏称呼。

Shinji was, to put it nicely, considered too forward and impolite by most of his classmates. They spoke ill of him in more stinging ways, and only when he was within earshot. So he gave up on trying to be polite. There were a few that warmed up to him despite his growing reputation, like Aida, Suzahara and Horaki and Shoho and Kirishima. They let him know a little about themselves in idle chat between classes, and shared small details of their lives with him while they cleaned in the afternoons. Despite his attempts to keep to himself, he listened. Perhaps he hadn't given up being polite entirely. When they in turn became curious, he made things up or answered in short, simple sentences.  
真嗣被大多数同学认为，说得客气点，过于直率和无礼。他们用更尖刻的方式在背后议论他，而且只在他能听到的时候。因此，他放弃了努力表现得礼貌。尽管他的名声越来越差，还是有几个人对他敞开了心扉，比如相田、铃原、洞木和东治以及桐岛。他们在课间的闲聊中向他透露了一些自己的事情，下午打扫卫生时也分享了一些生活中的小细节。尽管他试图独来独往，但他还是倾听了。也许他并没有完全放弃礼貌。当他们反过来对他产生好奇时，他编造了一些故事或用简短的句子回答。

He didn't take part in any of the club activities or school events, and this was a problem for the upperclassmen, some of whom took it upon themselves to try and straighten him out. They invited him to work for booths or stalls during fairs or encouraged him to accompany them to kendo club or baseball. If he didn't outright refuse, he would promise to attend if only to get them away from him for the time being. Either way, he became a reoccurring disappointment and for some that was an intolerable disrespect. More often than not he got into fights with the upperclassmen, putting to test all that he had learned under Weissenberg. He went home with a few scratches and bruises, but nothing compared to the fractures and tender ribs he left the others with. It felt good to win at something for a change.  
他从不参与任何社团活动或学校庆典，这让高年级生颇为头疼，其中一些人甚至自告奋勇试图纠正他。他们邀请他在集市上帮忙摆摊，或鼓励他陪同去剑道社或棒球社。如果他没有断然拒绝，他就会答应出席，只为暂时摆脱他们的纠缠。无论哪种情况，他都成了反复令人失望的存在，对某些人来说，这种态度是不可容忍的轻蔑。他常常与高年级生发生冲突，将他在魏森贝格手下学到的所有本领付诸实践。他带着几处擦伤和瘀伤回家，但这些与他留给对方的骨折和隐痛肋骨相比，简直微不足道。能在某件事上获胜，感觉真好。

That came to a head when he broke a third year's wrist. Not just any third year, but Kirishima's older brother, Jiro. He spent a day in the hospital while they ran x-rays, set the bones and made him a plaster cast, which he would have to wear for the next two months. Jiro had a part-time job dishwashing at a nearby Teishoku restaurant in the 5th block to help his father and sister, and he couldn't begin working again for at least six weeks. They'd fire him for sure.  
事情的爆发点在于他弄断了三年级学生的一条手腕。不仅仅是任何三年级学生，而是桐生会长的哥哥二郎。他在医院度过了一天，接受 X 光检查，固定骨头并打上了石膏，接下来的两个月他都得戴着这个。二郎在第五区的定食餐厅兼职洗碗，以帮助父亲和妹妹，至少六周内他无法复工。他们肯定会解雇他。

It was a rare day that Shinji was able to be in the same room as Kirishima, let alone talk to her. He was given a wide berth in hallways. People went out of their way not to speak with him. Even Hikari, perhaps one of the nicer girls he'd ever met, kept her distance. Misato reprimanded him but didn't do much beyond a serious talk at the kitchen table that night.  
难得有一天，真嗣能和桐生同处一室，更别提和她说话了。他在走廊上总是被人避之不及。人们特意绕道，避免与他交谈。即便是光，可能是他遇到过的比较友善的女孩之一，也保持距离。美里训斥了他，但除了当晚在厨房餐桌上的严肃谈话外，并没有采取更多措施。

Quickly, no one wanted to interact with him for fear of being considered some crass brute by association, and that was fine with Shinji. Things had always been that way for him, it would have been foolish to expect otherwise even in his home country. He was used to not being liked.  
很快，没有人愿意与他交往，生怕被视为粗鲁之徒的同伙，这对真嗣来说无所谓。他一直如此，即使在祖国，期望有所不同也是愚蠢的。他习惯了不被喜欢。

Being outed as a pilot made it worse. He was met with some praise from those he knew better in his home room. But instead of merely being seen as a cold brute, it painted him as a callous elitist who thought he was better than everyone else and could do what he wanted because of his position with NERV.  
被曝光为驾驶员让情况变得更糟。他在自己熟悉的班级里得到了一些赞扬。但这样一来，他不仅被视为冷酷无情的野兽，还被描绘成一个自以为高人一等、可以为所欲为的冷酷精英，这一切都源于他在 NERV 的地位。

In all that time he didn't see his father once.  
在那段时间里，他一次也没见过他的父亲。

His days became quiet and uneventful again, inhabited only by schoolwork and simulation training at NERV. Unit-01 wasn't finished yet, so he wasn't even able to test with the core while it was being anchored. The other pilot he rarely saw, a specter haunting his periphery. Thinner and paler than most, he found himself glued to her every movement whenever he caught sight of her, both at NERV and school. Poisonous thoughts occupied him.  
他的日子再次变得安静且平淡无奇，只有学校作业和在 NERV 的模拟训练相伴。初号机还未完工，所以他甚至无法在它被固定时进行核心测试。另一位他很少见到的驾驶员，像幽灵一样萦绕在他的视野边缘。她比大多数人更瘦更苍白，每当他在 NERV 或学校瞥见她时，他发现自己总是紧盯着她的每一个动作。有毒的念头占据了他的心。

What kind of person was she? What kind of person was it that was able to stay in headquarters instead of being sent to Germany for training? As far as he could tell she had a dismal sync-rate, even if that was only from contact tests with the core instead of the actual unit. Still, it should have been higher.  
她是个什么样的人？是什么样的人能够留在总部，而不是被派往德国接受训练？就他所知，她的同步率低得可怜，尽管那只是与核心的接触测试，而非实际机体的数据。尽管如此，同步率本应更高些。

So what was it? He watched her at school, how she spent the lectures and lessons staring at cloudy skies. Reading from well-worn physics books during break. She never brought lunch, using a NERV card to buy from the vending machines. Often something organic, eating delicately. If they were assigned to cleaning duty, he glanced her working with simple, unhurried ease. She took the same route to and from home every day at exactly the same time, in exactly the same seats.  
那么，究竟是为什么呢？他观察她在学校的表现，她如何在课堂上凝视着阴云密布的天空。课间从磨损的物理书中汲取知识。她从不带午餐，用 NERV 卡从自动售货机购买食物。通常是些有机食品，吃得很细致。如果被分配到清洁任务，他会看到她以简单、不紧不慢的轻松态度工作。她每天上下学都走同一条路线，时间分秒不差，座位也总是相同。

Some days, she disappeared entirely.  
有些日子，她会完全消失。

At NERV, while the pit crews ran diagnostics or when they made weekly tunings to the command suites, he witnessed his father come down to the cages and talk with her and smile with her, eyes pinched with endearment. It was the only time her face gave way to any kind of expression, one of warmth and adoration.  
在 NERV，每当维修团队进行诊断或每周对指挥室进行调校时，他目睹父亲来到笼子前与她交谈并微笑，眼中流露出宠爱的神情。那是她脸上唯一会流露出某种表情的时候，一种温暖和崇拜的表情。

It made him sick to his stomach.  
这让他感到恶心。

Yet she never said anything to him. Never rubbed it in his face or did any of the things he had come to expect of other people. His disdain twisted into curiosity. She never spoke with anyone at school and neither did anyone go out of their way to speak with her. After another month of this, he made a decision out by the track fields. He would talk to her, and at least only have to brace himself for silence or an unkind word from what could only be cold indifference. In a way, he admired it. If he could be more like that, maybe his father would treat him better. Maybe he wouldn't be so unbearable.  
然而她从未对他说过什么。从未在他面前炫耀或做出任何他预期中其他人会做的事。他的轻蔑逐渐转变为好奇。她在学校从不与人交谈，也没有人特意去和她说话。又过了一个月，他在跑道旁做出了一个决定。他要和她说话，至少只需准备好面对沉默或冷漠的言语。在某种程度上，他对此感到钦佩。如果他能更像那样，也许父亲会对他更好。也许他就不会那么难以忍受。

"I don't understand why he talks to you," he said, looking over his shoulder at her. It wasn't said with anger, he couldn't quite muster that. It was simply something that he desperately needed to know. She was sitting with her back to the fence, dressed in a swimsuit that never saw use. He was on the other side, sweating in his track shorts and T.  
"我不明白他为什么和你说话，"他回头看着她说。这并非出于愤怒，他还没能完全表达出那种情绪。这只是他迫切需要知道的事情。她背靠着栅栏坐着，穿着一件从未用过的泳衣。他在另一边，穿着运动短裤和 T 恤，满头大汗。

"Is that why you have been watching me?" She asked without even glancing at him. There didn't seem to be anything in particular she was looking at.  
"这就是你一直在观察我的原因吗？"她问，甚至没有看他一眼。似乎没有什么特别的东西吸引她的目光。

The links complained as he turned. "What's he like?"  
链条发出吱吱声，他转过身来。"他是什么样的人？"

"Don't you know?" From her, it barely sounded like a question, her voice all but swallowed by the hollers and noise of the other kids. He wasn't even supposed to be up there so close to where the girls were swimming, and some were casting him worried looks and whispering among themselves. Shinji turned away, facing the track field down the hill where boys leaned against the concrete inclines and leered in his direction.  
"你不知道吗？" 她的话几乎淹没在其他孩子的喧闹声中，听起来都不像是个问题。他本不该那么靠近女生游泳的地方，有些女生正担忧地看着他，窃窃私语。真嗣转过身，面向山坡下的田径场，那里的男孩们倚靠在混凝土斜坡上，朝他的方向投来不怀好意的目光。

"Isn't he your father?" "他不是你父亲吗？"

"He's not a father," Shinji snapped, a frown tugging at his mouth. Rei didn't budge, and he folded inward. "He might be my dad, but… he doesn't care about me. So why does he care about you?" The last part he was hardly able to utter.  
"他不是父亲，" 真嗣厉声说道，嘴角牵出一丝皱眉。绫波没有动摇，他则内敛起来。"他可能是我爸爸，但是…他不在乎我。那他为什么在乎你？" 最后那部分他几乎说不出口。

Cicadas screeched over the schoolyards, the sun coming down in blazing sheets through a cloudless blue sky. Rei's head dipped, and she finally said, "I do not know."  
蝉鸣在学校操场上尖锐地响起，烈日透过无云的蓝天倾泻而下。丽低下头，终于说道：“我不知道。”

Shinji got up and made his way down the hill, followed by curious eyes.  
真嗣起身，沿着山坡走去，身后是好奇的目光。

By then, Unit-00 was completed for testing and Shinji was slated as the pilot.  
那时，零号机已完成测试准备，真嗣被定为驾驶员。

"I thought Unit-one was supposed to be mine?" He had to admit being a little disappointed at being given the Prototype as his assigned unit. It was sure to be clunky and difficult to handle, despite Ritsuko's assurances that its command suite had just recently been overhauled to the 2014 standards.  
"我以为一号机应该是我的？" 他不得不承认，被分配到原型机作为他的指定单位，他感到有些失望。尽管律子保证其指挥系统刚刚升级到了 2014 年的标准，但这台机器肯定笨重且难以操控。

"Once complete, yes," she said, giving him a patient smile. "Until then, you and Rei will rotate testing phases with the Prototype. We may as well start with some of the cross-compatibility tests while both of you are here, and while we have the time for it. Your sync-rate is higher, so you're up first."  
"完成后是的，" 她微笑着耐心地说，"在那之前，你和绫波将轮流进行原型机的测试阶段。既然你们俩都在这里，我们不妨趁有时间开始一些交叉兼容性测试。你的同步率更高，所以你先来。"

His father stood in the control room that day alongside Misato, watching.  
那天，他的父亲和美里一起站在控制室里观看。

Shinji remembered clearing the absolute borderline – and then there was screaming, not from him, but echoing from the plug-depth. Claws of barbed wire dragged over his mind, carving into him as the LCL became thick and bloated – choking.  
真嗣记得自己越过了那条绝对的界限——随后便是尖叫声，并非出自他口，而是从插入栓深处回荡而来。带刺的铁丝网般的爪子划过他的心灵，刻入他的身体，随着 LCL 变得浓稠臃肿——令人窒息。

Then he was waking up in the hospital, feeling as though he had just slept for a hundred years. It was a sight and sometimes a feeling he had grown accustomed to, back when they'd done neural testing at Gehirn.  
然后他在医院醒来，感觉仿佛刚刚睡了一百年。这一幕，有时这种感觉，他早已习以为常，那是在 Gehirn 进行神经测试的时候。

Sitting beside his bed was Rei.  
坐在他床边的是绫波。

"What do you want?" he asked, voice coming out as a weak rasp instead of an unkind sneer. Probably for the best, because he wasn't sure if he meant it.  
"你想要什么？" 他问道，声音嘶哑无力，而非刻薄的嘲讽。或许这样更好，因为他不确定自己是否真的有那个意思。

The girl's stare was unwavering. "It will be my turn next."  
女孩的目光坚定不移。"接下来就轮到我了。"

Shinji grunted, shifting to face the window. "Guess I messed it up, huh?"  
真嗣咕哝一声，转身面向窗户。"看来我搞砸了，是吧？"

Rei considered the cart across the room, atop which sat a tray with water, the pouring pitcher half empty.  
丽考虑着房间另一头的推车，上面放着一个托盘，盛水的壶已经半空。

"She is closed to you. To everyone."  
“她对你封闭了心扉。对所有人都是。”

"What do you mean?" The presence of the Eva, what they had told him was its cyber-mind, had always been a pervasive but calm lull in the back of his nerves. A weight, even a passive presence. Never something so torrent and… angry.  
“你这是什么意思？”那个 Eva 的存在，他们告诉他是其网络意识，一直是一种无处不在但平静的低语，潜藏在他神经的深处。一种重量，甚至是一种被动的存在。从未如此汹涌且……愤怒。

"We are alike that way," she said, fixed on the pitcher. He waited for further explanation, but she said nothing more and remained at his bedside a little while longer.  
“我们在这点上很相似，”她盯着水壶说道。他等待着进一步的解释，但她再没多说，只是在他的床边多待了一会儿。

Rei tried several times for hour-long spans to synchronize with Unit-00, but couldn't manage to get her sync-rate over the borderline. The process was usually so draining she had to spend a day in the hospital anyway just so they could monitor her for a little while. That and Ritsuko was concerned there might be neural contamination.  
丽尝试了几次，每次长达一小时，试图与零号机同步，但始终无法将同步率提升到临界值以上。这个过程通常非常耗费精力，她不得不在医院里待上一天，以便他们能监控她一段时间。此外，律子还担心可能存在神经污染。

Most days, Shinji sat by the chainlink fence that cut between them at school, sharing in quiet company, talking very little and sometimes about his father. She didn't seem to mind him there and, if she was as cold a person as he suspected, would have told him off already. He was fine with the fence sitting between them. He had decided not to talk to her in class.  
大多数日子里，真嗣坐在学校里将他们隔开的铁丝网旁，静静地陪伴着，很少交谈，有时会聊到他的父亲。她似乎并不介意他在那里，如果她像他所怀疑的那样冷漠，早就让他离开了。他对铁丝网隔在他们之间并不介意。他决定不在课堂上和她说话。

When Rei finally cleared her borderline, it did something to the Eva. Hydraulics groaned, restraints snapping with wall-shaking force. Misato grabbed him – glass shattered, flecks of it pelting his head. Red lights washed the room as alerts sounded and voices hollered, one of them was Ritsuko. Over by a blood-stained console, someone gasped for air.  
当丽终于突破她的界限时，这影响到了 Eva。液压装置发出呻吟，束缚带以震撼墙壁的力量断裂。美里抓住了他——玻璃碎裂，碎片如雨点般打在他的头上。红色警示灯照亮了房间，警报声响起，人们呼喊着，其中一个是律子。在血迹斑斑的控制台旁，有人喘息着。

Another voice shouted for Rei, a figure in black throwing open the test chamber's stairwell door. Shinji pushed himself out of Misato's arms, her hands brushing his face for wounds. It felt like he was cut – everything stung – and she tried to grab him, but he wriggled free, stumbling down the stairs after his father. He practically fell down the last set, the man already half way across the chamber where Rei's entry plug lay. Unit-00 had its fingers sunk into the wall, stuck rigid while bakelite pooled down its back and over its legs. His father called for her again, setting his hands on the super-heated hatch.  
另一个声音呼喊着丽，一个黑衣人猛地推开测试室的楼梯门。真嗣从美里的怀抱中挣脱出来，她的手轻拂过他的脸颊检查伤口。他感觉自己被划伤了——一切都刺痛着——她试图再次抓住他，但他扭动着身子逃脱，跌跌撞撞地跟在父亲后面下楼。他几乎是从最后几级台阶上摔下来的，而他的父亲已经穿过半个房间，来到了丽的插入栓旁。零号机将手指深深插入墙壁，僵硬地固定在那里，而胶木从它的背部流下，覆盖了它的双腿。他的父亲再次呼唤她，双手放在过热的舱门上。

Shinji reached him as he hollered and staggered back. Glasses slapped the floor and the man lunged after the handles again, gritting his teeth as he struggled against the levers. Though Shinji's body moved, clutching one end of the manual release, his mind wondered in a rush if they would open it to reveal nothing more than a broken corpse. What if the safety harness had failed? What if the wall impacts had snapped her neck?  
真嗣在他大喊并踉跄后退时赶到了他身边。眼镜啪的一声摔在地上，那人再次扑向操纵杆，咬紧牙关与拉杆搏斗。尽管真嗣的身体在移动，紧握着手动释放的一端，他的思绪却急速飘忽，怀疑他们是否会打开它，只揭示出一具破碎的尸体。万一安全带失效了呢？万一墙壁撞击折断了她的脖子呢？

The rubber of his suit boiled and split open, fire lancing over his skin and frying the sensitive sensors beneath. The hatch burst open and Shinji tumbled, his father ducked into the plug and calling her as LCL spilled over their legs. Shinji propped himself up on an elbow, all at once weighed down with exhaustion. Past the Commander, he could see her in the dark of the plug, trembling. Though her pale face didn't move, scared eyes stared at his father.  
他身上的橡胶服沸腾并裂开，火焰灼烧着他的皮肤，烧毁了下面的敏感传感器。舱门猛地打开，真嗣跌了出来，他的父亲弯腰进入插入栓，呼唤着她，LCL 液体溢满了他们的双腿。真嗣用一只胳膊肘撑起自己，突然间感到疲惫不堪。透过指挥官，他能看到她在插入栓的黑暗中颤抖。尽管她苍白的脸没有动，但惊恐的眼睛盯着他的父亲。

"I see," Gendo said, staying with her half-way in the plug.  
“我明白了，”源渡说，停留在插入栓内半途与她相对。

The paramedics arrived soon after and his father moced to stand beside him in the pool of LCL. One of them approached the man, trying to inspect his burns. With them was Misato, who latched onto Shinji's shoulders and pulled him close, his back pressing against her.  
救护人员很快赶到，他的父亲移动到他身边，站在 LCL 的池水中。其中一人走近那男子，试图检查他的烧伤。Misato 也在他们之中，她紧紧抓住真嗣的肩膀，将他拉近，他的背部紧贴着她。

"I'm sorry, sir," she said, gripping him tight.  
“对不起，先生，”她说着，紧紧抓住他。

Gendo moved the paramedic away with an arm. His palms were black and boiled and red, bright blood seeping from the warped tissue. "See to the boy," he said, holding Shinji's eyes.  
源渡用一只手臂将救护人员推开。他的手掌黑红交织，血从扭曲的组织中渗出。“先照顾那孩子，”他说着，目光紧锁真嗣的眼睛。

They set Rei on a gurney and fit a breathing mask over her face. The man did as he was told, taking Shinji's hands to inspect and rifling through the kit slung over his shoulder. Shinji was barely present for the affair. His wounds were not so bad.  
他们将丽放在担架车上，并在她脸上罩上呼吸面罩。那人照吩咐行事，握住真嗣的手进行检查，并从肩挎的急救包里翻找物品。真嗣对这一切几乎心不在焉。他的伤并不严重。

Gendo followed the paramedics as they moved the gurney, slipping through the LCL in their haste. Rei watched him as she passed, and Shinji realized he didn't hate her, and probably never could.  
碇源堂紧随担架车，匆忙中穿过 LCL 液体。丽在经过时注视着他，真嗣意识到自己并不恨她，或许永远也不会。

The activation test for Unit-01 came up soon after that, which he passed with comparative ease.  
不久后进行了 01 机体的启动测试，他以相对轻松的方式通过了。

Unit-00 was suspended until they could work out the bugs. He spent quiet evenings with Rei, watching her sync tests from the control room and reading, subject to the occasional teasing of Ritsuko or Misato – sometimes both.  
零号机被暂停使用，直到他们能解决所有问题。他安静地与绫波度过夜晚，在控制室观看她的同步测试，阅读书籍，偶尔会受到律子或美里——有时是两人的——调侃。

"Such a dashing knight, running to the rescue of his fair maiden!"  
“真是个英勇的骑士，奔向拯救他心爱的少女！”

"_Stop teasing me_!" “别取笑我了！”

They finished assignments in the harsh plainness of her apartment. She put as much effort into the homework as she did with everything else: minimal. It wasn't as though she was unintelligent. In fact, he only knew of one other teenage girl that read Schrödinger and Heisenberg in their free time. Much like him, school didn't seem to hold any importance in her day to day life. It was important to him only because it was important to others. Sometimes they ate together, usually anywhere that had a decent vegetarian menu. Shinji always paid with the prepaid card Misato loaned him, and later groaned about.  
他们在她简陋的公寓里完成了作业。她对待作业的认真程度与对待其他事情一样：极低。这并非因为她不聪明。事实上，他只知道另一位少女在闲暇时会阅读薛定谔和海森堡的著作。就像他一样，学校在她日常生活中似乎并不重要。对他来说，学校重要仅仅是因为对其他人重要。有时他们会一起吃饭，通常选择有不错素食菜单的地方。真嗣总是用美里借给他的预付卡结账，事后总会抱怨一番。

He woke early to gray mists that gave way to burning waves of heat and came home late to watch TV with Misato and the bird or lie in his room listening to the tick-tick of his watch until he fell asleep. It swam over his time at school, blurring all else around him. Pooled into him as he sat for long ours deep within NERV, in the Eva, wondering when the Angels would finally come.  
他早早醒来，面对着灰蒙蒙的雾气，随后是炙热的浪潮，深夜回家与美里和那只鸟一起看电视，或躺在房间里听着手表的滴答声直到入睡。学校时光在他脑海中模糊不清，周围的一切都变得模糊。当他长时间坐在 NERV 深处，在 Eva 里，他陷入了沉思，想知道天使何时会最终到来。

There was a muggy Saturday morning they walked through the 3rd Block, the solar panel towers turned to catch the sun. A fruitless pursuit. Sluggish swells of gray gradually moved the skies and reflected in their surfaces. Out from one of their usual haunts, tucked in a well-maintained alley behind a series of apartment, they passed a row of uniform bikes, locked in place.  
那是一个闷热的周六早晨，他们穿过第三街区，太阳能板塔转向捕捉阳光。一场徒劳的追逐。灰色的缓慢波浪逐渐移动着天空，并映照在他们的表面上。从他们常去的一个藏身处出来，蜷缩在一排公寓后面的一条维护良好的小巷里，他们经过了一排整齐停放的自行车，锁在原地。

"We should rent bikes," he said.  
“我们应该租自行车，”他说。

Rei followed his stare. "Why?"  
丽跟着他的目光。“为什么？”

"Haven't you ridden one before?"  
"你以前没骑过吗？"

Rei shook her head and he remembered being utterly baffled by that. It was the same look Asuka had given him when they were six and she found out he couldn't swim. He could swim just fine now, but it had involved frantic flailing and near drowning with the worst coach on the planet.  
丽摇了摇头，他记得当时完全摸不着头脑。那表情和明日香六岁时发现他不会游泳时如出一辙。他现在游泳没问题了，但那次经历包括了疯狂的扑腾和差点溺水，还有世界上最糟糕的教练。

He felt something slip from his grasp. "Oh, then maybe we shouldn't."  
他感到有什么从手中滑落。"哦，那也许我们不该这么做。"

"Why?" "为什么？"

He gave a half grimace. "You don't know how, so you'll probably just fall and get hurt."  
他露出一丝苦笑。“你不知道怎么操作，很可能会摔倒受伤。”

"I am used to pain."  
“我习惯了疼痛。”

He thought of her shaking inside the entry plug, small and weak. "That doesn't make it okay." Even as he said the words, they sounded fake – like someone else were speaking them through his mouth.  
他想起她在驾驶舱里颤抖的样子，娇小而脆弱。“这并不能让它变得无所谓。”即使他说出这些话，也感觉像是别人借他的口说出来的，显得那么不真实。

Rei didn't comment on that, fixed on the row of bikes as though she were trying to solve some difficult puzzle. They moved on and didn't talk about it again.  
丽对此没有发表评论，目光紧盯着那一排自行车，仿佛在试图解开某个复杂的谜题。他们继续前行，再也没有提及此事。

Thinking on it now, Shinji nearly missed his stop, shouldering his way through boarding commuters to make it off in time. Normally he met Rei at 9th Block station and they would make the rest of the trip to school together. Often in silence, like most others they shared the train with. Rarely was the whisper of conversation heard, everyone walled into their own spaces despite being packed so close together.  
现在回想起来，真嗣差点错过了站，他挤过上车的乘客，及时下了车。通常他会在第九街区站与丽会合，然后一起前往学校。大多数时候他们都是沉默的，就像同乘一列火车的其他人一样。尽管挤得如此紧密，却很少能听到窃窃私语，每个人都沉浸在自己的世界里。

Some days they would even be accompanied by a buoyant Aida and perpetually peeved Suzahara. The latter seemed to go wherever the former was. Sometimes Shinji talked to Aida, but never more than superficial conversation. He was one of the few students that didn't seem to mind the reputation the rest of the school had given him. As for Suzahara… Shinji had decided he didn't like the boy very much, if only because he had decided the same. he had an unusual way of speaking, reminding him a little of Marcel from the _Kloster_.  
有些日子，他们甚至会有活泼的相田和总是不满的铃原相伴。后者似乎总是跟着前者。有时真嗣会和相田交谈，但仅限于表面的对话。他是少数几个不介意学校给他贴上标签的学生之一。至于铃原……真嗣已经决定他不太喜欢这个男孩，仅仅是因为他已经有了这样的决定。他的说话方式有些特别，让他想起了克洛斯特的马塞尔。

Rei absorbed herself in a book, while the two boys became embroiled in animated talk about some video game or basket ball or the military. Suzahara normally found other boys from their school to talk to – often other members of the basketball team.  
丽沉浸在书本中，而两个男孩则热烈讨论着某个电子游戏、篮球或是军事话题。铃原通常会找他们学校的其他男孩聊天——经常是篮球队的队友。

And then there was Shinji, sitting idle between them.  
而真嗣则坐在他们中间，无所事事。

Sometimes, watching the two boys board their separate trains home, if they chose to walk with him and Rei that day, he thought of talking to them more. They were the only ones that spent any more time with him than required, but he suspected that was only because Aida was so interested in the Evas.  
有时，看着两个男孩各自登上回家的列车，如果那天他们选择和真嗣及丽一起走，他会想和他们多聊聊。他们是唯一愿意花时间陪伴他的人，但他猜这仅仅是因为相田对 EVA 非常感兴趣。

Then the departure alert would blare, and they would be gone, along with that frail line of thought.  
随后出发警报会响起，他们将随之消失，连同那脆弱的思绪一起。

He was on his way to school now after a long absence, all of it on his mind again. Shinji turned the corner along a high-rising wall, and there was Asuka leaning against it by the crosswalk, dressed in his school's standard white and blue uniform. A wash of memories welled to choking, unable to process any one and overflowing as a bloated mass of ill-defined feeling. They hadn't spoken since a couple days ago.  
他现在正赶往学校，经历了长时间的缺席，所有往事再次涌上心头。真嗣转过街角，沿着一面高墙前行，只见明日香倚靠在人行道旁的墙边，身着他们学校标准的蓝白制服。一连串回忆涌上心头，令人窒息，无法聚焦于任何一段，而是化作一团难以名状的复杂情感。他们已经好几天没说话了。

"Hey," she said, tossing hair over a shoulder.  
“嘿，”她开口道，甩了甩肩上的头发。

"Uh, hey." "呃，嘿。"

Asuka looked him up and down before turning back to the road. After a stretched moment, he stepped forward but kept some feet between them. They waited in the heat until the walk sign flashed green.  
明日香上下打量了他一番，然后转回视线看向道路。过了一会儿，他向前迈了一步，但仍与她保持一定距离。他们在酷热中等候，直到行人通行的绿灯闪烁亮起。

"So you made it to your hotel okay?"  
"所以你顺利到达酒店了吗？"

"Yeah, it was pretty late so I had Kaji pick me up."  
"是啊，已经很晚了，所以我让 Kaji 来接我。"

He nodded with his chin, "what's with the uniform?"  
他用下巴点了点头，"怎么穿成这样？"

"It's called cosplay, right?" she asked, holding her hands behind her back as they walked.  
"这叫角色扮演，对吧？" 她问道，双手背在身后，他们一起走着。"

"Alright," he sighed, yielding to her game. "Who're you supposed to be?"  
"好吧，" 他叹了口气，屈服于她的游戏。"你这是扮的谁？"

She slowed her pace so they were side by side, but only to tug on his earlobe. "NERV's top pilot."  
她放慢脚步，与他并肩而行，却只是拽了拽他的耳垂。"NERV 的王牌驾驶员。"

He glowered and jerked his head away, to which she laughed. "What's the real reason?" He asked.  
他皱眉，猛地甩开头，她则笑了起来。"真正的原因是什么？" 他问道。

Her smugness endured. "I'm under orders."  
她的得意之情溢于言表。“我奉命行事。”

"To go to school?" “去上学？”

Asuka let out an impatient sigh. "Is there a limit to how many dumb questions you can ask in a day?"  
明日香不耐烦地叹了口气。“你一天能问多少个蠢问题啊？”

"Fine. I don't care," he said, and started walking faster.  
“好吧，我不在乎。”他说着，加快了脚步。

She clicked her tongue and he could imagine her eyes rolling. "I don't know _why_ I have to attend school here, okay? I mean, I've already graduated University. How asinine is that? It's just what command wants. That's what Misato said, anyway."  
她咂了咂舌，他能想象到她的白眼。“我不明白为什么我得来这里上学，好吗？我是说，我已经大学毕业了。这有多荒谬？只是命令要求而已。至少美里是这么说的。”

Shinji grunted in response and the rest of the walk to school was uneventful, save for the squealing of cars and discordant bustle of children. Asuka tried filling the silence several times but gave it up when all he delivered were non-committal grunts. The Third Municipal was up on a hill at the edge of the 3rd Block, built atop smooth concrete walls that flushed with the inclines. Asuka's head bobbed about as she took everything in, drawing curious eyes in return. They walked in side by side.  
真嗣咕哝了一声作为回应，剩下的上学路程平淡无奇，除了汽车的尖叫声和孩子们的嘈杂声。明日香几次试图打破沉默，但当他只是含糊地咕哝时，她放弃了。第三市立学校位于第 3 区的边缘，建在平滑的混凝土墙顶上，墙体随着坡度流动。明日香的头四处转动，观察着一切，引来了好奇的目光。他们并肩走着。

The school had been there before the city was thrown up and, despite extensive renovations, still held on to a well-worn and rustic foundation. The classroom was all pine wood floors and wide panels, with tall windows to let the light in. The desks were the same color as the floor, chipped and frayed at the edges. Wash cloths hung from the support bar of the chairs, along with other bits and pieces of import depending on the student. Notebooks, lanyards, and lunches. Itineraries and charts plastered the walls, giving the place the sense of an untidy office.  
这所学校在城市建立之前就已存在，尽管经历了大规模的翻新，依然保留着一种历经岁月、古朴的基调。教室里铺满了松木地板和宽大的镶板，高大的窗户让光线充分洒入。桌子的颜色与地板一致，边缘磨损、剥落。椅子的支撑杆上挂着洗碗布，还有学生们各自珍视的小物件。笔记本、挂绳和午餐盒。行程表和图表贴满了墙壁，让这个地方给人一种杂乱办公室的感觉。

As he walked into class 2-A, his sight fell on Shoho sitting in the corner nearest the front window and talking with Kirishima and a few others. The latter, a girl with long black hair, made an effort of ignoring his presence. Shinji looked away as Shoho met his eyes, finding Asuka standing by the door and waving to some passing students she'd caught in greetings.  
当他走进 2-A 教室时，目光落在了坐在靠近前窗角落的翔阳，正与桐生和另外几个人交谈。后者，一个长发黑发的女孩，故意忽视了他的存在。真嗣移开视线，当翔阳与他目光相接时，他发现明日香站在门口，向一些路过的学生挥手致意。

"I'll, uh, see you later, I guess," he said.  
“呃，我想，待会儿见吧，”他说。

She gave him a look. "This is my classroom too, dork. Why do you think I followed you this far?" she pushed into the room and approached the black board, plucking a piece of chalk in her fingers. All eyes were drawn to her as she charted her name in elegant cursive. Finished, she set the chalk down and spun on a heel to face the class.  
"她给了他一个眼神。“这也是我的教室，傻瓜。你以为我为什么跟你走到这么远？”她推门而入，走向黑板，用手指夹起一支粉笔。所有目光都集中在她身上，她用优雅的草书写下自己的名字。完成后，她放下粉笔，脚跟一转，面向全班。”

"I'm Asuka. Asuka Langley Soryu – charmed, huh?"  
“我是明日香。明日香·兰格雷·索鲁——很高兴认识你们，嗯？”

Their class rep beamed at the prospect of a new addition, gliding up to meet her along with several others. Asuka smiled, laughing and chatting excitedly as she traded names and acquaintances.  
班长对新成员的到来显得兴高采烈，与其他几人一起轻盈地迎上前去。明日香微笑着，兴奋地交谈并交换着名字和相识。

Shinji moved away. Rei was where she usually sat, gaze drawn from the window and stuck to him.  
真嗣移开了视线。丽依旧坐在她常坐的位置上，目光从窗外收回，定格在他身上。

"Morning, Rei." “早上好，丽。”

"Shinji," she said, offering her small, ghost of a smile. It left just as quickly as she studied him. "You are annoyed."  
“真嗣，”她轻声回应，露出一抹淡淡的、幽灵般的微笑。笑容转瞬即逝，她随即审视着他。“你看起来很烦躁。”

He waved his hand, urging her to forget about it, and took the seat next to hers, which was only a row forward from Aida and Suzahara. The latter had his legs propped up on the desk and the former leaned flat over his.  
他挥了挥手，示意她别在意，然后坐在她旁边的前一排座位上，离 Aida 和 Suzahara 仅隔一排。后者把腿翘在桌子上，前者则整个人趴在他身上。

"Hey, Ikari!" he said, ever excitable, a goofy smirk on his face.  
“嘿，Ikari！”他总是那么兴奋，脸上挂着傻笑。

"Hey," Shinji grunted. Suzahara scoffed, more interested in the event at the front of class.  
“嘿，”Shinji 咕哝了一声。Suzahara 嗤之以鼻，更关注课堂前方的活动。

"Everyone's been saying you two died, but I knew that couldn't be true. The Evas must've been heavily damaged for you to be gone so long. Then that battle a couple days ago – there's supposed to be a new Eva isn't there? Well, I mean, I already know there is. My dad's department has been slammed just getting ready. Who's the pilot, Ikari?"  
大家都说你们俩死了，但我知道那不可能。Eva 一定受损严重，你们才消失了这么久。然后前几天那场战斗——不是说有新的 Eva 吗？嗯，我是说，我已经知道有了。我爸的部门光是准备就忙得不可开交。谁是驾驶员，碇？

He nodded to the front of the class. "She is." He figured if he didn't say so, Asuka would at some point. Despite the Information Disclosure packet he'd received on arrival, there wasn't a point in pretending. Asuka didn't care about that confidential stuff anyway. Besides, a lot of kids in their school had parents that worked for NERV. They'd hear about it one way or another.  
他向教室前方点了点头。“是她。”他想，如果他不说，明日香也会在某一刻说出来。尽管他到达时收到了信息披露包，但假装没有意义。明日香反正不在乎那些机密的东西。而且，他们学校里很多孩子的父母都在 NERV 工作。他们迟早会以某种方式听说。

Aida's eyes went back and forth between him and Asuka. "No way," he breathed, awe and something else creeping in his voice, "oh man… and she's a foreigner? Wow…"  
相田的目光在他和明日香之间来回移动。“不可能，”他低声惊叹，声音中流露出敬畏和别的东西，“哦，天哪……她还是个外国人？哇……”

Shinji made a furtive glance and shrugged. "She's okay."  
真嗣偷偷瞥了一眼，耸了耸肩。"她还好。"

"Hey, you guys walked in together. Do you know her or something? I guess that makes s–"  
"嘿，你们俩是一起进来的。你认识她吗？我猜这让你成了——"

"Of course he does!" Asuka declared, sitting herself atop Shinji's desk, "me and this dork have been friends since we were kids." She reached out and ruffled his hair some before he shoved her arm away. Asuka smirked off his withering glare, bouncing off his desk and striding back to the front of class.  
"他当然认识！"明日香宣布道，一屁股坐在真嗣的桌子上，"我和这个呆子从小就是朋友。"她伸手揉乱了他的头发，直到他推开她的手臂。明日香对他的怒视不以为意，从桌子上跳下来，大步走回教室前。

"Damn," Suzahara made something of a laugh. "Hard to believe you ever made friends, Ikari. She must be as messed up as you."  
"该死，"铃原发出了一声近乎笑声的感叹。"真难相信你还能交到朋友，碇。她一定和你一样乱七八糟。"

"Shut up," he mumbled. "闭嘴，"他咕哝道。"

"Oh, hit a nerve? Man, you're just full of surprises today."  
"哦，触到痛处了？伙计，你今天真是惊喜连连啊。"

Aida nudged him with an elbow and gave Shinji and apologetic look.  
Aida 用肘轻轻推了他一下，向 Shinji 投去一个歉意的眼神。

He put his back to the class, talking with Rei, asking her how she was feeling and explaining why he couldn't visit her the past couple days. All the while he couldn't keep from glancing over his shoulder as his friend drank in the attentions of those around her.  
他背对着全班同学，与 Rei 交谈，询问她的感受，并解释为什么过去几天无法探望她。与此同时，他忍不住频频回头，看着他的朋友享受着周围人的关注。

He'd forgotten how much he hated this.  
他忘了自己有多讨厌这样。

---

There was something very… precise about her features. Every contour appeared measured, even molded in a way that had Asuka dismissing them as dull. Her skin was smooth and unblemished, silken hair a light blue and neatly combed down to her shoulders, lips a cross between tan and barely pink. There were other parts of her that she scrutinized, took in at great detail and comparison _–_ as one might compare cuts of meat at a market _–_ and seethed as her inadequacies mounted.  
她的五官有种非常……精确的美。每一道轮廓都显得经过精心测量，甚至可以说是塑造得恰到好处，这让明日香觉得它们乏味无趣。她的皮肤光滑无瑕，丝绸般的头发呈淡蓝色，整齐地梳至肩头，唇色介于浅棕与微粉之间。她审视着她的其他部分，细细打量并进行比较——就像在市场挑选肉品一样——随着自己不足之处的累积，她感到一阵恼怒。

If Asuka could describe her in a word, it would be porcelain. Like a doll. She'd been eyeing the girl since that morning, catching the small flecks of interaction she had with Shinji. He didn't speak much of anything to anyone else in the class, herself included. The other girl seemed attentive to him, listening, nodding, occasionally allowing herself the barest of smiles.  
如果明日香能用一个词来形容她，那就是瓷器。像个娃娃一样。从那天早上开始，她就一直在观察那个女孩，捕捉到她与真嗣之间微小的互动。他在班上几乎不和任何人说话，包括她自己。而那个女孩似乎对真嗣很关注，倾听、点头，偶尔露出最浅淡的微笑。

Here, at the end of the day, her and Shinji were out at the edge of the baseball field, sitting under a shaded bleacher while a boys team geared up for practice. Five minutes had gone by since Asuka had caught them in the corner of her eye and kept a careful watch. She was by the entrance to the shoe lockers, half invested in a conversation with a group of her new friends, though she couldn't remember their names. Really, she just wanted to go back to her apartment, and she wasn't going to stick around for that idiot.  
傍晚时分，她和真嗣来到了棒球场边缘，坐在遮阳的看台下，此时男孩子们正准备开始训练。自从阿斯卡在眼角瞥见他们并保持警惕观察以来，已经过去了五分钟。她站在鞋柜入口处，一半心思在与一群新朋友的交谈中，虽然她记不清他们的名字。实际上，她只想回到自己的公寓，不打算留下来陪那个傻瓜。

She removed herself from conversation, stowing her ugly school shoes away and hastily slipping into her low-top canvases. The plink of bats started over the fields and she followed the fences around to the courtyard entrance, just by the bleachers. Halfway to them, she stopped.  
她从谈话中抽身，将难看的校鞋收好，匆忙换上低帮帆布鞋。球场上传来了球棒的叮当声，她沿着围栏走到庭院入口，就在看台旁边。走到一半时，她停了下来。

One of the batters struck out and kicked up some dirt beneath his cleats. His teammates in the dugout gave him brotherly pats to the shoulder, assuring him he was still welcome on the team and wouldn't be ostracized forever over a practice game. He still slouched forward and hung his head as he watched the next one come up to bat.  
其中一名击球手三振出局，在钉鞋下扬起了一阵尘土。休息区的队友们拍拍他的肩膀，以兄弟般的安慰告诉他，他仍是球队的一员，不会因为一场练习赛而被永远排斥。尽管如此，他还是垂头丧气地向前倾，看着下一位击球手上场。

Shinji just barely managed not to jump as Asuka plopped down next to him. "_Hallo Shinji! Wie geht's_?"  
真嗣勉强控制住自己没有跳起来，因为明日香一屁股坐在了他旁边。“你好，真嗣！最近怎么样？”

"_Uh– h-hallo, Asuka. Gut_?" He managed.  
“呃——你、你好，明日香。挺好的？”他勉强回答道。

"_Wer ist dein freund, hm_?" She asked, nodding at the girl.  
“你的朋友是谁呀，嗯？”她问道，朝那个女孩点了点头。

Shinji remembered himself then, falling into Japanese. "Oh, uh, this is Rei, she's a pilot too."  
真嗣这时才回过神来，切换到了日语。“哦，呃，这是绫波，她也是一名驾驶员。”

"Hello, Rei. You must be the pilot for the prototype, then? I'm Asuka, pilot of Unit-two – the actual combat model. Like I said earlier, me and Shinji have been friends since we were little, but I'm sure he's told you all about that."  
“你好，绫波。那你一定是原型机的驾驶员了？我是明日香，二号机的驾驶员——真正的战斗机型。就像我之前说的，我和真嗣从小就认识，但他肯定已经把这一切都告诉你了。”

Rei shook her head, just so. "He has not."  
绫波轻轻摇了摇头，只是这样。“他没有。”

Asuka smiled an unnatural smile.  
明日香露出了一个不自然的微笑。

The second batter, striking out twice, nailed the ball on the third pitch. Far enough for it to be caught readily by a midfielder. The batter slowly tested the swing of the wood in his hand as the umpire called him out, perhaps considering whether or not to wallop _him_ instead. Bitterness crept into his expression.  
第二名击球手，两次三振出局后，在第三次投球时击中了球。球飞得足够远，被一名中场球员轻松接住。击球手慢慢地试着手中的木棒，当裁判叫他出局时，他可能在考虑是否要揍他一顿。他的表情中流露出苦涩。

"Lemme see your arm," Asuka said, making it less a request and more a demand as she reached out and grabbed Shinji's arm. He didn't resist, watching as she found and traced a thin white sliver that went from crease of elbow to wrist. "Wow, you still have this?" Asuka glanced at Rei for a reaction, but she gave none.  
“让我看看你的手臂，”明日香说着，与其说是请求，不如说更像是在命令，她伸出手抓住了真嗣的手臂。他没有反抗，看着她找到并沿着一条从肘部到手腕的细小白线划过。“哇，你还有这个？”明日香瞥了一眼绫波，但她没有任何反应。

Shinji shrugged. "It was a pretty deep cut."  
真嗣耸了耸肩。“伤口挺深的。”

"Yeah. This was when I pushed you into the rose bush, right?" She asked, like she'd only just remembered. It was odd to think it had happened nearly ten years ago, and she felt a severe sense of otherness holding his arm. She remembered it very well. "I kind of forgot about that."  
“是啊。这就是我把你推到玫瑰丛那次，对吧？”她问道，仿佛刚刚才想起来。想到这已经是近十年前的事了，她感到一种强烈的异样感握着他的手臂。她记得非常清楚。“我有点忘了那件事。”

"Well, I didn't," he said, trying to tug away. She tightened her grip.  
“好吧，我没忘，”他说着，试图挣脱。她握得更紧了。

"When did you get this?" she touched the rough, maroon patches of skin stretching over his palm.  
“你什么时候弄的这个？”她触摸着他手掌上覆盖着的粗糙、紫红色的伤痕。

"Just an accident," he said, tugging again, and she let him have his arm back. _Liar_.  
“只是个意外，”他说着，又拽了一下，她便让他拿回了自己的手臂。骗子。

Something was writhing in the undercurrent of his posture, wound up like it was when she'd first come to the base days ago. He stowed his phone away and fished out an ancient black box. His old SDAT, ear buds wrapped around its frame. A shout came from the field and the third batter threw his bat against the fence. Shinji didn't move to put them in, but she got the feeling he wanted to leave. Even when they were kids, he was always listening to that thing. The girl Rei watched the game without much interest.  
他的姿态中潜藏着某种翻腾的情绪，就像她几天前刚到基地时那样紧绷。他收起手机，掏出一个古老的黑色盒子。那是他旧时的 SDAT 随身听，耳机线缠绕在机身外。球场上传来一声呼喊，第三击球员将球棒扔向围栏。真嗣没有动身去戴耳机，但她感觉到他想离开。即使在他们还是孩子的时候，他总是听着那东西。女孩丽毫无兴趣地观看着比赛。

"How was your first day?" he asked, in a way that wasn't entirely curious. Probably because he wasn't.  
"第一天感觉如何？" 他问道，语气并非完全出于好奇。大概是因为他并不真的关心。

"Tedious." Asuka got up first, grabbing her bag. She was tired of this. "You live over by Myojogatake, right?"  
"乏味至极。" 明日香率先起身，抓起她的包。她已经厌倦了这一切。"你住在明城岳附近，对吧？"

"Yeah." "嗯。"

"That's close to where the surface line is for my GeoFront suite. You and Zero can ride home with me up until there."  
"那离我的地表线路很近，就在 GeoFront 套房附近。你和零可以和我一起乘车，直到那里。"

"Zero?" “零？”

"Yeah," she put on a look of practiced innocence. When he continued to stare, her brow knotted, and she splayed a hand out. "For her Eva unit?"  
“嗯，”她摆出一副惯常的无辜表情。当他继续盯着她时，她的眉头皱起，摊开一只手。“为了她的 Eva 机体？”

"Right," he said, mistrust lingering with it.  
“对，”他带着疑虑说道。

With that, she, Rei and Shinji walked off campus to the whispers of others and made their way to the nearest station, a mile walk north down highway 45.  
说完，她、丽和真嗣便离开了校园，身后是窃窃私语的人群，他们向北走了一英里，来到了 45 号高速公路旁的最近车站。

Asuka walked ahead, Shinji just behind and Rei towing the rear. On a corner, the same she'd met Shinji at that morning, they passed a unagi place. The smell of steaming, seared eel greeted her and made her mouth water, though she'd never tasted it before. It was warm and humid out, as though being wrapped in flannel blankets fresh out of the dryer, the layers pealing off into something less sweltering as they descended into the crowded suburbs. Jellyfish flags hung from the light posts and wiggled in the breeze.  
明日香走在前面，真嗣紧随其后，丽则拖在队尾。在一个转角处，也就是她那天早上遇到真嗣的地方，他们经过了一家鳗鱼店。蒸腾的、烤得焦香的鳗鱼香味迎面扑来，让她垂涎欲滴，尽管她从未尝过。天气温暖而潮湿，仿佛被刚从烘干机里拿出来的法兰绒毯子包裹着，随着他们深入拥挤的郊区，这层层热气逐渐散去，变得不那么闷热。灯柱上挂着水母旗，在微风中摇曳。

"Well, it looks like I'm pretty popular," Asuka cut the stagnant air, glancing behind. Shinji was looking across the street.  
“看来我还挺受欢迎的嘛，”明日香打破了沉闷的空气，回头瞥了一眼。真嗣正望着街对面。

"Oh, yeah?" That tone of disinterest sprouted again.  
"哦，是吗？" 那种不感兴趣的语气又冒了出来。

"It's understandable," she went on with a contented sigh, "I'm overflowing with talent and potential, after all."  
"这很正常，" 她带着满足的叹息继续说道，"毕竟我才华横溢，潜力无限。"

He shook his head, edging a cynical smile. "I don't get it."  
他摇了摇头，嘴角勾起一抹讽刺的微笑。"我不明白。"

"Poor Shinji, always so slow to adapt." She gave a mock pout and jumped up onto a nearby ledge, following it down the sidewalk.  
“可怜的 Shinji，总是适应得那么慢。”她假装撅嘴，跳上附近的窗台，沿着人行道一路走下去。

He shrugged, sticking a hand in his pocket. "I guess so."  
他耸耸肩，把手插进口袋。“我想是吧。”

"Ooh, what's wrong?" she asked, unable to resist a toothy grin, "are you jealous?"  
“哦，怎么了？”她忍不住露出牙齿笑道，“你嫉妒了吗？”

That lifted his lip in a half-snarl. "Of what?"  
他嘴角一扯，半是咆哮地问：“什么？”

"My _obvious_ superiority."  
“我那显而易见的优越感。”

"Superiority complex, maybe. _Not_ jealous."  
“优越感倒是有，嫉妒可谈不上。”

Asuka stiffened at that, allowing her smirk to fade. The sidewalk dipped, leaving her standing on high at the corner to look down on him. "You never could admit when you got beat – if you didn't give up to begin with, that is. Just sulk and pout until someone, _usually me_, felt sorry enough for you."  
听到这话，明日香的身体一僵，嘴角的笑意也随之消失。人行道在这里下沉，让她站在高处，俯视着他。“你从来不会承认自己被打败——如果你一开始就没放弃的话。只会闷闷不乐，嘟囔着直到有人，通常是我，对你感到足够同情。”

"Shut up," he said, trying to glare up at her, but the sun was too bright. She could tell that'd hurt him, just like she wanted, a much smaller voice telling her to stop.  
“闭嘴，”他试图瞪着她，但阳光太过刺眼。她能感觉到这伤到了他，正如她所愿，一个更微弱的声音告诉她停下来。

But she couldn't. Not after today. "Must've been nice when I left, then you could forget all about me and feel superior by yourself."  
但她做不到。不是在今天之后。“我离开的时候一定很美好吧，那样你就可以忘掉我，独自感觉高人一等了。”

"I was pissed off at you, okay!?" He shouted. She jumped, but just as soon fixed him with a glare and crossed her arms. His fury melted and he took a step back, facing away from her and letting out a puff of hot air. Rei, standing several paces behind, had tensed. Those red eyes came to stare at Asuka, who's chest prickled as though pierced.  
"我当时真的很生你的气，好吗！？" 他喊道。她吓了一跳，但很快用目光回敬他，双臂交叉。他的怒气消散了，退后一步，背对着她，呼出一口热气。丽站在几步之外，身体紧绷。那双红眼睛转向盯着明日香，她的胸口仿佛被刺穿般刺痛。

"_What_?" She snapped. "什么？" 她厉声道。

Zero said nothing and, after a painful pause, moved to stand beside Shinji and wait for the crosswalk to change.  
零什么也没说，在一段痛苦的沉默后，走到真嗣旁边，等待人行横道信号灯的变化。

Asuka climbed down from the ledge, landing hard on her heels and stumbling a little. She used it as an excuse to shoulder Shinji in an arm. He shot her a look but she stared ahead, catching it in her periphery.  
明日香从窗台上爬下来，重重地落在脚后跟上，略微踉跄了一下。她顺势用肩膀撞了一下真嗣的胳膊。他瞥了她一眼，但她只是直视前方，用眼角捕捉到了他的目光。

Traffic plowed through humid air, brakes squealing, and then the crosswalk beckoned them to move. Smells of gasoline and burning asphalt soured in her nose. In a moment she hated the metropolis and everything with it, aching for the old city of Heidelberg. Or perhaps something far less tangible and attainable.  
车流在潮湿的空气中穿梭，刹车声刺耳，随后人行横道召唤他们前行。汽油和烧焦的柏油味让她鼻子发酸。那一刻，她憎恨这座大都市及其一切，渴望回到海德堡的老城。或者更抽象、更难以企及的东西。

It was like the world had finally opened up to her there. As though she'd been wrapped in this stagnant shadow, unable to spread her wings. All at once she was free from her mansion and her step mother and her father and that place with so many horrible memories. At the University she was master of her future and everyone knew her name, knew how great she was going to be, envied her bright radiance. Finally, she would be treated as an adult instead of some naive child, a feeling sweet and long coveted.  
仿佛世界终于向她敞开了怀抱。她曾被这停滞的阴影包裹，无法展翅高飞。突然间，她摆脱了那座豪宅、继母、父亲以及那个充满可怕回忆的地方。在大学里，她是自己未来的主人，每个人都知晓她的名字，知道她将会有多么伟大，羡慕她耀眼的光芒。终于，她将被当作成年人对待，而不是某个天真的孩子，这种感觉甜美而久久渴望。

Often that wasn't how it turned out.  
但往往事与愿违。

Often, she found herself trapped at a crossroads with no clear direction. Each path seemingly another misstep, foggy and unclear. It was then, when Heidelberg seemed the most remote place on the planet, that she reached out to the last connection she had with her home and the garden. It was what made her realize that at some point Shinji had given up maintaining contact and she'd sent that stupid letter in a moment of weakness. Not that it had mattered, he'd never read it. Maybe it was better that he left it unopened. He'd decided she wasn't worth the effort anymore. Her gaze settled on Rei.  
她常常发现自己困在十字路口，没有明确的方向。每条路似乎都是另一个错误的选择，朦胧而不清晰。正是在海德堡仿佛成了地球上最遥远的地方时，她向与家乡和花园的最后联系伸出了手。这让她意识到，不知何时，真嗣已经放弃了保持联系，而她在脆弱时刻寄出的那封愚蠢的信，他从未读过。或许他未曾拆封反而是件好事。他已经认定她不值得再费心了。她的目光落在了绫波身上。

They boarded a rail car and grabbed seats. She left two between them.  
他们登上了一辆轨道车，各自找了座位。她留了两个座位在他们之间。

"I really can't stand you," she said, more to the window across from them than to him.  
"我真的受不了你，"她对着对面窗户说，而不是对着他。

Shinji stared between his feet. "I know."  
真嗣盯着他的脚之间。"我知道。"

---

Shinji watched a pair of girls down on the other end of the train, one on the phone and the other skimming through a manga. Both taking brief breaks to talk at the other. They were from a school on the other side of town. The skirts were different, red and plaid like back home. Beneath them the rails clacked, shadows dancing through the cars from the overhead cable lines.  
真嗣看着车厢另一端的两个女孩，一个在打电话，另一个在翻阅漫画。两人不时停下来和对方交谈。她们来自镇上的另一所学校。裙子不同，红色格子，像家乡的一样。在她们脚下，轨道咔嗒作响，头顶的电缆线投下的阴影在车厢内跳跃。

"Soryu... she is your friend?"  
"惣流...她是你的朋友吗？"

Shinji flinched and faced Rei, who'd taken up residence beside him. She watched him, intent, but patient. Asuka had gotten off at the last stop, sparing neither of them a look or a word.  
真嗣一惊，转向了丽，她已经在他旁边坐了下来。她注视着他，专注而耐心。明日香在上一站下了车，没有看他们中的任何一个，也没有说一句话。

"Yeah. I don't know." He said, glancing back at the girls. He hunched forward, elbows on his knees and fingers intertwined.  
"嗯。我不知道。"他说着，回头看了看那两个女孩。他向前弓着身子，双肘撑在膝盖上，手指交缠。

Rei's gaze strayed from him for a moment, to the Tokyo-3 towers lording over the city, taller even than the mountains – or so it seemed. He'd been on those mountains, visiting derelict Buddhist temples and once a church, which was only a long-abandoned set of ruins sinking into murky waters.  
真嗣的目光从他身上移开了一瞬，望向了东京-3 市上空高耸的塔楼，它们甚至比山峰还要高耸——至少看起来如此。他曾在那些山上游览过废弃的佛教寺庙，还有一次是一座教堂，那只是一片早已荒废、沉入浑浊水中的废墟。

"We used to be really good friends," he said, staring through the girls, both there and a thousand miles away at once. "Well… she was my best friend. We grew up together, and all that. Then we stopped being friends."  
“我们曾经是非常好的朋友，”他透过女孩们说道，她们既在眼前，又仿佛远在千里之外。“嗯……她是我的挚友。我们一起长大，所有那些时光。然后我们就不再是朋友了。”

Rei hummed, and he could sense her eyeing him again. It was familiar, the way she did it, as though trying to find some missing piece of him. He couldn't say what it reminded him of, but it was the same thing he saw when she cleaned or ate or sat at her desk to do homework. It was Rei.  
真嗣轻哼一声，他能感觉到她再次打量着他。这种感觉很熟悉，她总是这样，仿佛在寻找他身上缺失的一块。他说不上来这让他想起了什么，但这是他在她打扫、吃饭或坐在桌前做作业时看到的同一种感觉。这就是真嗣。

"Yet she insists that you are," she said.  
"但她坚持说你是，" 她说。

He shrugged. "Maybe. I mean, she came to see me in the hospital after the last battle. All we really did was fight, but…"  
他耸了耸肩。 "也许吧。我是说，上次战斗后她来医院看我了。我们其实只是在争吵，但…"

The junior high schooler on her phone noticed his stare, smile giving way to a guarded disdain. She tapped her friend's shoulder and pointed at him. They each shifted and tugged at their skirts, which had hiked up some when they'd sat.  
那个初中生一边打电话一边注意到他的目光，笑容变成了戒备的轻蔑。她拍了拍朋友的肩膀，指了指他。她们各自调整了一下坐姿，裙子在坐下时有些上滑。

Cheeks heated, he watched the cable lines pass by instead.  
脸颊发热，他转而注视着窗外掠过的电缆线。

"And now she says she can't stand me," he said, and maybe that was fair of her say.  
“现在她说她受不了我了，”他说，或许她这么说也无可厚非。

"She is abrasive to you."  
“她对你态度生硬。”

Shinji's smirk was sardonic. "That's just how Asuka is."  
真嗣的冷笑带着讽刺。“那就是明日香的风格。”

"It is..." Rei paused, hand gliding up along the side of her head and through her hair, pining it by an ear. "Disagreeable."  
“确实……”绫波顿了顿，手顺着头侧滑过，穿过发丝，将头发别在耳后。“令人不快。”

"Ever since I can remember she's been trying to prove how much better she is than me."  
“从我记事起，她就一直在试图证明自己比我强多少。”

She let her hair fall, hands returning to her lap. "And is she?"  
她任由发丝垂落，双手回到膝上。“那她呢？”

Her questions, as always, seemed less for her own curiosity.  
她的提问，一如既往，似乎更多是为了满足他人的好奇。

"It doesn't matter," he said, the words unpalatable. Metal screamed as they eased into port, an automated message playing in a woman's voice. They would be taking separate ways home. There was one more stop he had to make.  
“这无关紧要，”他说道，语气中带着难以掩饰的不快。金属摩擦声中，他们缓缓靠港，一段自动播放的女声广播响起。他们将各自回家。他还有一站要停。

"Will you be alright?" She asked, broaching a different subject altogether.  
"你还好吗？" 她问道，完全换了一个话题。

"Yeah. I'll be fine," he lied, shouldering his bag and leaving for a GeoFront NERV line. "See ya'."  
"嗯，我会没事的，" 他撒了个谎，背起书包前往 NERV 地下的 GeoFront 线路。"再见。"

Rei stayed quiet, as she sometimes did, and once on the platform he turned. Others passed by him and soon the doors closed, pulling her out of reach.  
丽保持沉默，她有时会这样，当他在站台上转身时，其他人从他身边经过，很快车门关闭，将她从他的视线中拉走。

Doctor Okinoshima's office was immaculate, except for the lone lotus flower sitting in a glass bowl of cool water on the window sill. A red lotus, its petals closed despite the time of day. It was on the opposite end from him, where two more windows stretched the right side of the room. Beyond that were the flawless walls of the inverted pyramid sinking alongside headquarters, the light beaming down from the surface turning their crystal sheen a blinding white.  
冲岛博士的办公室一尘不染，除了窗台上一个玻璃碗里静静盛放的莲花。一朵红莲，尽管已是白昼，花瓣却依然紧闭。它位于房间的另一端，对面是两扇延伸至右侧的窗户。窗外，是与总部并行的倒金字塔结构的完美墙壁，从地表照射下来的光线将它们的水晶光泽映照得耀眼夺目。

"How are you feeling?" Okino asked, as flat and smooth as the table between them.  
“你感觉怎么样？”冲野问道，语气平静如他们之间的桌子。

Shinji looked back, though her eyes weren't actually on him, focused instead upon the computer screen with professional purpose. "Okay, I guess," he said, slouching in the black leather chair that was two sizes too big. It and the lotus were the only discernible pieces of color.  
真嗣回头望去，尽管她的目光并未真正落在他身上，而是专注于电脑屏幕，带着职业的专注。“还行吧，我想，”他回答道，瘫坐在那把大得多的黑色皮椅上。椅子和莲花是房间里仅有的显眼色彩。

Without looking, Okino marked something on a pad under her right hand. "Have you been eating well?"  
奥基诺没有抬头，右手在面前的记事本上做了个标记。“你最近吃得还好吗？”

"Not really." “不太好。”

Another mark, other hand sliding a bit of shoulder length hair back behind her ear. "And why is that?" she asked, all without sounding remotely curious.  
她又做了个记号，另一只手轻轻将肩上的长发撩到耳后。“为什么呢？”她问道，语气中没有丝毫好奇。

Shinji gave that some thought, watching the lotus drift ever so subtly in its tiny pond, particles playing over its rosy buds. "I don't know… sometimes I just don't want to eat, even if I feel hungry." And it had never happened to him before either. Not even when he was a child and fresh off being sent away from his father. Even though it felt like that, where he was closed in on all sides by the plain, ordinary pressure of his walls, as ordered and lifeless as the office he sat in.  
真嗣沉思了一会儿，注视着莲花在它那小小的池塘中微妙地漂移，微粒在其粉红色的花蕾上嬉戏。“我不知道……有时候我就是不想吃东西，即使我觉得饿。”而且这种情况以前从未发生在他身上。甚至在他还是个孩子，刚被送离父亲的时候也没有。尽管感觉就像那样，他被四周平淡无奇的压力包围着，就像他所在的这个井然有序、毫无生气的办公室一样。

"Have you recently experienced anything traumatic?"  
“你最近经历过什么创伤性事件吗？”

Shinji thought that was an odd question. He'd spent isolated months trying to synchronize with Unit-00 before his Eva had been finished. Had sortied four times now against an enemy he still didn't know anything about, and had been subject to the lasting tremors of sympathetic pain for days after. But those weren't traumatic things, were they? He was just doing what he was supposed to do. He was strong – like a soldier – and soldiers didn't feel like those things were wrong. Did they?  
真嗣觉得这个问题很奇怪。他曾孤身数月试图与零号机同步，直到他的 EVA 完成。现在已经出动了四次，对抗一个他仍然一无所知的敌人，并且在之后的几天里一直承受着同情的痛苦余震。但那些不是创伤性的事情，对吧？他只是在履行他应该做的。他很坚强——像一个士兵——士兵不会觉得那些事情是错的。他们不会吗？

Unsure of how to answer, he fidgeted. "Um, like what?"  
"不确定如何回答，他有些局促不安。“嗯，比如什么？””

Okino spoke quickly, but without annoyance. "A car accident, witnessing a violent act, intense physical harm to your person."  
"冲野说话很快，但没有不耐烦。“比如车祸，目睹暴力行为，或者自己遭受严重的身体伤害。””

"Oh… then yes." "“哦……那确实有。””

Another mark. Something unseen scribbled. "And have you been experiencing any nightmares?"  
又一道痕迹。某种看不见的东西在涂写。“你最近有做噩梦吗？”

Black, consuming ones. Worse than the dreams he used to have of being alone in a vast, wide ocean with nothing but darkness below him. In these new dreams he often walked in tall fields of wet grass that brushed his knees. Fog crept over the land, concealing it from view, a pale light sitting in the mists as though morning was mere minutes from breaking. But morning never came. He had a sword in his hand, but no armor, and no shield. They were gone, or destroyed, or stolen. He didn't know. From the encircling mists wandered these things that slithered like snakes, but their scales shook and spread outward like thorns to cut him as they crawled over his feet and wrapped around his ankles. They were big and fat and vicious, and he swung his sword, slicing them open and in two and through the head.  
漆黑、吞噬一切的噩梦。比他过去梦见自己孤身一人在无边无际的海洋中，下方只有黑暗的梦境还要糟糕。在这些新梦中，他常常走在高高的湿润草丛中，草叶轻拂他的膝盖。雾气悄然笼罩大地，将其隐藏起来，雾中有一抹苍白的光，仿佛黎明即将破晓。但黎明从未到来。他手中握着剑，却没有盔甲，也没有盾牌。它们消失了，被摧毁了，或是被偷走了。他不知道。从环绕的雾气中，游荡出这些像蛇一样滑行的生物，但它们的鳞片颤动着向外展开，如同荆棘般在他脚上划过，缠绕在他的脚踝上。它们庞大、肥硕且凶猛，他挥舞着剑，将它们劈开、斩断，甚至贯穿头部。

It didn't matter how many he killed. More always appeared, and always twice as many as he slew. In the distance he could see eyes. Hollow, round eyes without irises staring at him from a stark shadow with pointed ears. As he killed the slithering creatures, the thing's jagged, smiling maw opened – breathing more of the thick fog that clouded the world around him while a waterfall of snakes poured from between its teeth. The dream ended inevitably when there were so many they wrapped every inch of him, carving into his flesh and devouring him piece by piece.  
无论他杀掉多少，总会有更多出现，且数量总是他杀掉的两倍。在远处，他能看见眼睛——空洞、圆形的眼睛，没有瞳孔，从有着尖耳朵的阴森影子中盯着他。当他杀死那些滑行的生物时，那东西锯齿状的微笑嘴巴张开了——吐出更多浓雾，这些雾气笼罩着他周围的世界，同时蛇群如瀑布般从它的牙齿间倾泻而出。梦境不可避免地结束于当它们多到将他全身每一寸都包裹起来，切割他的肉体，一点一点吞噬他。

"Yes," Shinji said. “是的，”真嗣说。

The doctor tore a square of paper from her pad and handed it to him. "Here are two prescriptions – one for the nightmares, and a refill of your antidepressants."  
医生从她的便签本上撕下一张方形的纸递给他。“这里有两张处方——一张用于治疗噩梦，还有一张是你的抗抑郁药的续药。”

Shinji took it, barely, his attention captured by the lotus again. "Miss Okinoshima. I think your flower is dying." There didn't seem to be any other reason for it to still be closed.  
真嗣勉强接过，注意力再次被那朵莲花吸引。“冲岛小姐，我觉得您的花快要凋谢了。”似乎没有其他理由让它依然闭合。

She paid his comment no mind, turning fully to her computer. "I will see you in two weeks."  
她对他的评论置若罔闻，完全转向电脑。“两周后见。”

He stepped out into the gray halls of headquarters, Okino's door whispering shut. An apparition of his imagination, if not for the silver plaque preceding her office. Shinji stared at it for a pause that stretched into hollow, aching minutes.  
他走出总部灰暗的走廊，冲野的门悄无声息地关上。如果不是她办公室前那块银色的铭牌，这简直像是他想象中的幻影。真嗣盯着它，那一刻仿佛被拉长，变成了空洞而痛苦的几分钟。

Okino was one of two psychologists staffed at headquarters, whom he was mandated to see twice a week. She mostly asked him general questions and prescribed a few pills, which he never took. Once he found out no one was actually going to make him go, most weeks he simply didn't show up. Misato annoyed him a few times about it, even made a handful of empty threats about taking away his phone, but then gave up, deciding it was too much effort. That and she'd never been comfortable pushing him – unless it involved the Eva, then she was willing to shove.  
冲野是总部配备的两名心理学家之一，他被要求每周见她两次。她大多问些常规问题，开了些药，但他从未服用。一旦他发现没人真的会强迫他去，大多数星期他干脆就不露面了。美里为此烦了他几次，甚至发出过几次收回手机的空洞威胁，但最终还是放弃了，觉得这太费劲。此外，她从未感到有必要逼迫他——除非涉及 EVA，那时她倒是愿意推一把。

He resented her a little for it now. As always, he could never hate her indefinitely. He felt too guilty over holding a grudge against her to maintain one. Especially since he knew why she pushed herself to exhaustion. Why she hated the Angels so much. It was his responsibility to fight, and to win, if for no one else than for her.  
现在，他对她有些怨恨。但一如既往，他无法长久地恨她。他觉得自己因怨恨她而感到内疚，无法维持这种情绪。尤其是因为他知道她为何如此拼命，为何如此憎恨使徒。这是他的责任，为了战斗并取得胜利，如果不是为了别人，至少是为了她。

The sky was bleeding when he made it topside, spilling hues of orange and pink over every surface and painting black shadows where those couldn't reach. Cicadas wailed in the fading heat. Shops and business fronts were closing, bars and night-life restaurants just starting to open. He was on the edge of town and its narrow roads, people stretching out of windows to hang clothes or beat rugs. From a balcony in his apartment complex two Filipino men smoked, one of them hollering to someone inside.  
当他爬上地面时，天空仿佛在流血，橙红相间的色彩洒满每一处表面，而在那些光线无法触及的地方，则绘出了黑色的阴影。蝉在逐渐消退的热气中哀鸣。商店和商业门面正陆续关闭，酒吧和夜生活餐厅刚刚开始营业。他站在小镇边缘的狭窄街道上，人们从窗户里伸出身体晾晒衣物或拍打地毯。在他公寓楼的一个阳台上，两名菲律宾男子在抽烟，其中一人向屋内的人大声呼喊。

On the eleventh floor he keyed in the door code and it parted. "I'm home," he said. The apartment was dark. Several bags of trash lined the hallway waiting to be taken out. Shinji took off his shoes and made it into the kitchen, lit only by the glare of the setting sun through the balcony doors. Letting his book bag fall on a nearby chair, he pealed open a can of sardines and emptied it into Pen Pen's bowl. He tapped on the critter's fridge, signaling food, but he was probably asleep. The sour stink of raw fish poured over the apartment.  
在十一楼，他输入了门禁密码，门应声而开。“我回来了。”他说道。公寓内一片漆黑。几袋垃圾沿着走廊排列，等待被扔掉。真嗣脱下鞋子，走进厨房，只有阳台门透进的落日余晖照亮这里。他将书包扔在一旁的椅子上，打开一罐沙丁鱼，倒进 Pen Pen 的碗里。他敲了敲小家伙的冰箱，示意有食物，但它可能已经睡着了。生鱼的酸臭味弥漫在整个公寓中。

A beer can tumbled under foot as he sat, the tabletop a pile of newspapers, coasters, scissors, nail files, books, receipts, lottery scratch offs, a rice cooker and yet more cans of beer. There was a time when it had been a clean, welcoming place, and he had worked hard to keep it that way. At first they split up the chores evenly, but then the Angels came. He could clean up just fine, for a little while. Surfaces slowly became consumed with miscellaneous junk. Laundry went unfinished and sprawled throughout Misato's room, rarely folded and put away. Its influence spreading to the rest of the apartment, encroaching like the shadows outside.  
一个啤酒罐在他脚下滚过，他坐在那里，桌面上堆满了报纸、杯垫、剪刀、指甲锉、书本、收据、彩票刮刮卡、一个电饭煲，还有更多的啤酒罐。曾经，这里是一个干净、温馨的地方，他曾努力保持这种状态。起初，他们平分家务，但后来天使们来了。他可以暂时整理好一切，但不久，各种杂物慢慢占据了表面。未完成的衣物散落在美里房间各处，很少被折叠收好。这种影响蔓延到整个公寓，像外面的阴影一样逼近。

A sinking urge in the pit of his chest wanted him to clean it, to throw away all the refuse and junk. But day by day the task seemed that much more insurmountable, like wading through a river of mud. His room was the only haven left, and even that was escaping him. The dust had probably made a new layer since he was away in the hospital.  
他胸中涌起一股想要清理的冲动，想要扔掉所有垃圾和杂物。但随着时间的推移，这项任务似乎变得更加难以克服，就像在泥河中跋涉。他的房间成了仅存的避难所，就连那里也在逐渐离他而去。自他住院以来，灰尘可能又积了一层。

So he sat there in the stillness, occasionally disturbed by the hum of electronics. The daylight screams of the cicadas had calmed to droning chittering and chirps that clawed their way between the seams of the apartment. Through the walls he could hear someone knocking, maybe for the neighbor.  
于是他静坐在那片寂静中，偶尔被电子设备的嗡嗡声打扰。白日里蝉的尖叫已平息为低沉的唧唧喳喳，这些声音如同爪子般在公寓的缝隙间抓挠。透过墙壁，他能听到有人在敲门，或许是邻居的访客。

_Tap tap tap_. 咚咚咚。

An ocean of blue trespassed on the horizon, sweeping to consume the setting sun as it left, its radiance casting skyscraping pillars in stark black. Shinji thought to turn on a light or two as the dark settled over him, shrouding the mess of his apartment to an indistinct blur. He couldn't hear himself think.  
一片蔚蓝侵入了地平线，席卷而来吞噬了落日，余晖在天际投下高耸入云的黑色巨柱。随着黑暗笼罩，真嗣想着开一两盏灯，公寓的杂乱被遮掩成一片模糊。他几乎听不见自己的思绪。

_Tap tap tap_. 咚咚咚。

His bones were heavy, and his body didn't seem to be all there, like he were merely floating in it. Watching from inside. Shinji brought his knees up to his chest and clasped his hands around his ears.  
他的骨头沉重，身体仿佛并不完全属于他，就像只是漂浮在其中。从内部观察。真嗣将膝盖抱到胸前，双手紧捂住耳朵。

Still someone knocked. 依然有人敲门。

**A/N:**

I know these last two chapters have been rather slow and bloated as we explore the protagonists' time apart, but it seems for what I want to accomplish in this Arc, I may not be able to get away with shorter chapter formats like in Act I, where the storytelling had to be more condensed to cover such a long period of time. Well, that and I've always felt a chapter always ends up as long or short as it needs to be. Or maybe I just need to become a more ruthless editor, haha.  
我知道这最后两章节奏较慢且内容臃肿，因为我们正在探索主角们分开的时间，但似乎为了实现这一章节的目标，我可能无法像第一幕那样采用较短的章节格式，那里的叙事必须更加紧凑以涵盖如此长的时间跨度。好吧，除此之外，我一直觉得章节的长度总是会根据需要而变长或变短。或者也许我只需要成为一个更无情的编辑，哈哈。

Anyway, thanks for reading!  
无论如何，感谢阅读！

### Chapter 3: War and Peace
Shinji used to imagine Angels to be beautiful, winged beings dressed in white cloaks and glowing with a warm aura of light. That's how Preister Luitpold had made them sound.  
真嗣曾以为使徒是美丽的，长着翅膀的生物，身披白色斗篷，散发着温暖的光芒。这就是路易波尔德牧师所描述的样子。

When the Third Angel arrived, the battle lasted for three days.  
当第三使徒到来时，战斗持续了三天。

On the first day, the JSSDF scorched what was left of the Odawara countryside when they detonated an N2 mine to stop it. On the eve of the second day, just before sunrise, he and Rei were finally given clearance to launch. They'd been on battle-ready standby for the past twelve hours and engaged it at range from the mountains. He, with the long barreled bolt-action AW MK II, and Rei with the Type 20 Positron.  
第一天，日本自卫队引爆了一枚 N2 地雷，将剩下的小田原乡村化为灰烬以阻止它。第二天的黎明前，他和绫波终于获得了发射许可。他们已经处于战斗准备状态十二小时，从山中远距离与使徒交战。他使用的是长管栓动式 AW MK II，而绫波则使用 Type 20 阳电子炮。

The enemy was undefined, like peering through a foggy window. An ache throbbed under his forehead, his eyes trying in vain to focus a force that refused to be given form. Salvos of guided missiles and self-propelled artillery blossomed over its dark shape, while they watched from the ridgeline of Mount Ashigara.  
敌人模糊不清，如同透过雾窗窥视。一阵疼痛在他额头下跳动，他的眼睛徒劳地试图聚焦一个拒绝成形的力。制导导弹和自行火炮的齐射在其黑暗的轮廓上绽放，而他们则从芦之岳的山脊上观望。

As soon as it entered his range, Shinji drew a bead, or he tried to – the Angel was still an indistinct blur warring for definition. The targeter locked on to what his eyes couldn't perceive, compensating for muzzle drop and gravitational pull. He sent a heavy bolt plowing into the Angel, the round splashing apart over an invisible umbrella like a drop of water slapping a rock. Shinji primed another bolt in the chamber as Rei's positron whined, spitting streaks of gamma ray photons at the invader.  
一旦进入他的射程，真嗣便试图瞄准——但使徒仍然是一个争夺清晰度的模糊斑点。瞄准器锁定了他的眼睛无法感知的目标，补偿了枪口下垂和重力影响。他发射了一枚重型子弹，击中使徒，弹头在无形的伞上溅开，就像一滴水拍打在岩石上。真嗣在枪膛中装填了另一枚子弹，同时绫波的阳电子炮发出哀鸣，向入侵者喷射出伽马射线光子。

The beams dissipated and lost density as they entered the Angel's glaring shadow.  
光束在进入使徒耀眼的阴影后消散并失去密度。

"_A.T. Field neutralization nil. Advance."_  
"A.T. 力场中和无效。前进。"

As they sank into the valley, their Exclusion Zones shrank. Air pulsed, compacting and crushing the weapons in their grasp. Arcs of light speared towards them in sporadic patterns of attack – most missing by mere inches, others making glancing blows as the Angel continued to press its A.T. Field. They were ordered to retreat until the MAGI could conduct further analysis.  
随着他们深入山谷，他们的排斥区域缩小了。空气脉动，压缩并粉碎了他们手中的武器。光芒的弧线以零星的攻击模式向他们刺来——大多数仅以几英寸之差错过，其他则在天使继续施压其 A.T.力场时造成擦伤。他们被命令撤退，直到 MAGI 能进行进一步分析。

On the third day, Sachiel resumed its attack. For the Evas, fortified plating was replaced and systems were restored. Shinji wouldn't fail again. They intercepted it at the listening post by old Kino Cemetery.  
第三天，萨基尔恢复了攻击。对于 EVA 们，加固装甲被更换，系统被修复。真嗣不会再失败。他们在老基诺墓地的监听站拦截了它。

His father. "_Unit-one, engage the target before it breaches the defense line. Unit-zero will support your attack."_  
他的父亲。“一号机，在目标突破防线前将其牵制。零号机会支援你的攻击。”

"Understood." “明白了。”

Their A.T. Fields unfolded. He felt them make contact, could sense the pressure of the immense being in front of him pushing into his space, probing for weaknesses, feeling for invasion.  
他们的 A.T.力场展开了。他感觉到它们接触到了一起，能感知到面前这个巨大存在施加的压力，它在探寻弱点，试图侵入。

His Exclusion Zone dwindled.  
他的排斥领域正在缩小。

When Sachiel released its particle beams, they were more refined – more accurate than the MAGI had predicted. Light lanced into Unit-01's segmented abdomen. Armor split, bio-layers burst, and the Eva staggered. Braced against the ripping pain, Shinji listened to the rapid _tick-tick-tick_ of the stabilizer signal as he tried to bring Unit-01 off its side. Proximity alert – he hadn't even seen the thing move, and it had covered miles of distance in seconds. Hollow, white eyes stared down at him. Pallet rifle still in Unit-01's right hand, he shifted and pulled the trigger. The buzz of the rifle was cut short as the Angel collapsed its frame.  
当萨基尔释放其粒子束时，它们比 MAGI 预测的更为精细——更为精准。光芒刺入初号机分节的腹部。装甲裂开，生物层爆裂，Eva 踉跄后退。忍着撕裂般的痛楚，真嗣听着稳定器信号的急促滴答声，试图让初号机从侧躺中起身。接近警报——他甚至没看到那东西移动，它就在几秒内跨越了数英里的距离。空洞的白色眼睛俯视着他。初号机右手仍握着调色板步枪，他移动并扣动了扳机。步枪的嗡鸣声戛然而止，天使随即崩塌。

A blur of orange from the side. _Rei_.  
一抹橙色的模糊身影。是绫波。

Unit-00 was grabbed at the head in a flash of movement. Light flared in the Angel's palm, just as she wriggled to the side. The beam gouged its brain casing instead of blasting right through it. The force of the blow still tossed the Eva's head back, and she came crashing down like a cut tree.  
零号机在瞬间被抓住头部。天使掌中的光芒闪耀，她侧身一扭。光束凿穿了脑壳而非直接贯穿。冲击力仍将 Eva 的头颅猛地甩回，她如被砍倒的树木般轰然倒地。

"Rei!" Unit-01's prog-hatch opened.  
“零！”零一号机的推进舱口打开了。

The Angel's hand crushed the pauldron, snaring it in its fingers and ripping the metalwork off as though it were made of paper. The prog-knife went flying. With its other hand the Angel pressed Unit-01 flat on its back, holding him there as he struggled. A glimpse into senses that weren't his own, sensations and diluted impressions brushing his mind. The being was testing its strength, measuring itself against him, at least that's how it felt as it lifted its right hand – the same hand that had gouged Unit-00's head open, and wrapped Long fingers around the face-plate. Glass cracked and armor creaked.  
使徒的手压碎了肩甲，将其紧紧夹在指间，如同撕纸一般扯下了金属部件。推进刀飞了出去。另一只手则将零一号机按倒在地，任其挣扎。一阵不属于他的感官体验涌入脑海，模糊的印象轻拂着他的意识。这个存在似乎在测试自己的力量，衡量着与他的差距，至少他感觉如此，因为它举起了右手——那只曾将零零号机头部撕裂的手，长长的手指环绕在面罩周围。玻璃碎裂，装甲吱嘎作响。

Unit-00's shoulder crashed into the Angel. The prog-knife howled in her grasp, screaming as it punctured to the hilt in the shadow's chest. Rei stabbed it again, and again, and again – until something that must've been its engine revealed itself as a red orb. The Angel cast spiteful streaks of particles as it collapsed under the onslaught. Bits of Unit-00 melted away. The knife split into the core, and there was a rending light.  
零零号机的肩膀猛撞向使徒。推进刀在她手中呼啸，尖啸着刺入阴影的胸膛直至刀柄。零再次刺入，一次又一次——直到一个必定是其核心的红色球体显露出来。使徒在猛攻下崩溃，喷射出怨恨的粒子流。零零号机的碎片融化消散。刀刃劈入核心，一道撕裂的光芒迸发。

Black earth stretched beneath them, cracked and steaming. They powered down their Units and awaited retrieval.  
黑色的土地在他们脚下延伸，裂开并冒着热气。他们关闭了机甲，等待回收。

His mind replayed the battle, stuck in a loop. Even after they'd been recovered, into the next day at school and well into the long weekend nights.  
他的脑海中反复回放着战斗的场景，陷入了循环。即便在被救回后，到了第二天上学，乃至漫长的周末夜晚，这一幕依旧挥之不去。  
He should've been better than this.  
他本应做得更好。

A tremor shook the plug, bringing him back to the city blocks of Tokyo-3, where he fought the Sixth Angel again. Asuka was hollering at him, other voices cutting over the channel in a garbled mess. The gem-like plates of the Angel split apart, coalescing into its hawkish shape. Its shards jittered and the thing lunged for him.  
一阵颤动撼动了插入栓，将他拉回到东京-3 的街区，在那里他再次与第六使徒战斗。明日香对着他大喊，其他声音在频道中杂乱无章地交织。使徒宝石般的板块分裂开来，汇聚成其鹰隼般的形态。碎片颤动，那东西猛地向他扑来。

"_Cancel the simulation_." “取消模拟。”

The Angel's image froze mere moments before it would have collided with him, his Unit's arm still half-raised to draw the prog-knife too late. Slowly, the virtual world trickled out of existence, until it was just a grid of white wall inhabited only by Asuka's simulation plug across the way.  
使徒的影像在他即将被撞击的前一刻凝固，他的 EVA 机体手臂还半举着，试图拔出进度刀却为时已晚。渐渐地，虚拟世界消散，直到只剩下一片白墙网格，对面是明日香的模拟插入栓。

"I don't know why I bother with the mission objectives when you just ignore them," Misato said from where she leaned against a blank screen, arms crossed.  
“我不知道我为什么还要费心任务目标，当你总是无视它们的时候，”美里从她斜靠的空白屏幕旁说道，双臂交叉。

Shinji thought of several nasty retorts but kept them as thoughts only. They were in one of the ready rooms, which was built like a tiny theater – meant for maybe thirty people. He'd taken one of the seats nearest the door and farthest away from her.  
真嗣脑海中闪过几个尖刻的反驳，但只是想想而已。他们在一个准备室里，这个房间建得像个小剧院——大概能容纳三十人。他选了离门最近、离她最远的座位坐下。

When the quiet hum of the underground base persisted, her gaze fell to the side. She took a deep breath and sighed through her nose. "Shinji… they're talking about keeping you on standby the next time an Angel hits. Maybe even…"  
当地下基地持续的静谧嗡鸣声继续时，她的目光转向一旁。她深吸一口气，用鼻子叹息道：“真嗣……他们正在讨论下次使徒来袭时让你待命。甚至可能……”

_Suspension_. That ugly word slithered over his mind, muddying in a black river that threatened to drown him. When he realized he'd locked on to Misato, he found the floor instead, hoping the churning dread he felt hadn't come through.  
停职。那个丑陋的词在他脑海中蜿蜒爬行，污浊成一条黑色的河流，仿佛要将他淹没。当他意识到自己紧盯着美里时，他转而看向地板，希望那翻腾的恐惧没有表露出来。

It must have, because her shoulders dropped, and she pushed off the wall. "I doubt it'll happen. The Marduk Institute hasn't even located any of the other children yet… but Units three and four will be finished in just a couple months. Shinji it's–"  
她肯定察觉到了，因为她的肩膀垂了下来，从墙边走开。“我觉得不会发生。马尔杜克研究所甚至还没找到其他孩子……但三号机和四号机再过几个月就能完工了。真嗣，这——”

"My sync-rate is higher than anyone's," he bit out.  
“我的同步率比任何人都高，”他咬牙切齿地说。

Her demeanor turned icy. "It isn't about your sync-rate, and as of your last test – no, it isn't."  
她的态度变得冰冷。“这无关你的同步率，而且根据你上次测试的结果——不，也不是那个。”

"So what if I made a few mistakes."  
“就算我犯了几个错误又怎样。”

"You don't follow orders, Shinji!" Her voice filled the room and rang in his ears. He fought a frown and considered storming out, breath caught in his chest. Recycled air poured through the vents and the still wet plugsuit left him tensing against shivers. From the corner of his eye he saw her shift, ascending to the third tier where he sat.  
“你不服从命令，真嗣！”她的声音充满了房间，回荡在他的耳边。他强忍着皱眉的冲动，考虑着冲出去，胸中的呼吸被卡住。循环空气从通风口涌入，湿漉漉的插入栓服让他紧绷着对抗寒颤。从眼角余光中，他看到她移动了，登上他所在的三层。

"How can I let you onto the field if I can't trust you to do what I say?" she asked, searching him. Then, in a much quieter way, "don't you care what happens to you?"  
"如果我不能信任你按照我的指示行事，我怎么能让你上场呢？" 她问道，审视着他。然后，以一种更加轻柔的方式，"难道你不在乎自己的安危吗？"

There was another question beneath it, but he didn't want to consider the answer. "If I kill Angels, who cares?"  
这个问题之下还有另一个问题，但他不想去考虑答案。"如果我杀死了天使，谁会在乎呢？"

Misato's hand cinched his face, drawing it up so that he had no choice but to peer right into her burning eyes. "What did you just say?"  
美里用手托住他的脸，迫使他不得不直视她燃烧的眼睛。"你刚刚说什么？"

But there was no taking it back. So he said nothing.  
但覆水难收。所以他什么也没说。

"Fine." There was a tremble under her voice. "You want to be a soldier? You can start by _acting_ like one," she said, releasing him. "You aren't getting back in the simulators until you can take this seriously. _Dismissed_."  
“好吧。”她的声音带着颤抖。“你想成为一名士兵？那就从表现得像个士兵开始。”她松开他，说道，“在你能认真对待之前，别想再进模拟器。解散。”

There was a note of awful finality in her tone and his dislike for her deepened a little more, though not enough to choke down his guilt. She was his trainer, his commanding officer, his roommate, and sometimes a friend, but she was still… something undefined and nameless. Something he couldn't wholly trust, and now…  
她的语气中带着一种可怕的决绝，他对她的反感又加深了一点，尽管这还不足以压下他的内疚。她是他的训练官，他的指挥官，他的室友，有时也是朋友，但她仍然是……某种未定义且无名的存在。某种他无法完全信任的东西，而现在……

Shinji left the briefing room, heat like someone had lit a blow-torch over his sternum making him shake. He wandered into the locker rooms, vacant and echoing with stale, humid air. He stayed in the shower until the buzzer rang and the auto-shut off kicked in, dropping half the lights in the room. In the semi-darkness he changed into shorts and a sleeveless T, feeling neither like his school uniform or the NERV one. The empty plugsuit he left on the floor.  
真嗣离开了简报室，胸口仿佛被点燃了喷灯般的灼热让他颤抖。他漫无目的地走进更衣室，空荡荡的房间回响着潮湿、闷热的空气。他在淋浴间里一直待到蜂鸣器响起，自动关闭功能启动，房间里一半的灯光熄灭。在半明半暗中，他换上了短裤和无袖 T 恤，既不像校服也不像 NERV 的制服。他留下的空插槽服随意地扔在了地板上。

He had little memory of where he went after that, faces and hallways moving in an indistinct blur. Just outside the surface-level access gate for Terminal Dogma, he passed through one of the in-house lounges: a collection of padded seats, fake plants, and vending machines. Asuka sat under the TV, which paraded recent news to no one in particular. She had her still damp hair tied back in a ponytail, A-10 clips snug where her pigtails normally sat and invoking, as always, the image of a cat. She was curled up on one of the lounge chairs, scrolling through her phone with captured disinterest. He fought the impulse to ask her what she was doing there.  
之后他几乎记不清自己去了哪里，面孔和走廊在模糊不清的迷雾中移动。就在通往最终教条区的地表入口外，他穿过了一个内部休息室：一排排软垫座椅、假植物和自动售货机。明日香坐在电视机下，电视上播放着最近的新闻，却无人特别关注。她的头发还湿漉漉的，扎成了马尾，A-10 发夹紧紧固定在她通常扎双马尾的位置，一如既往地让人联想到猫的形象。她蜷缩在一个休息椅上，漫不经心地翻看着手机。他强忍着问她在那儿做什么的冲动。

It had been a week since he yelled at her and instead of feeling less guilty, like he wanted, Shinji only felt more so. He was a small boy again, contemplating in an aching stupor what he had done to upset his friend this time. Except, for this instance, he knew all too well. It didn't make him any less angry. It was ridiculous for her to be upset over it.  
自从他朝她大吼已经过去一周了，非但没有像他希望的那样感到内疚减轻，真嗣反而更加愧疚。他仿佛又变成了那个小男孩，痛苦地沉思着自己这次又做了什么惹恼了朋友。只是这一次，他再清楚不过了。这并没有让他不那么生气。她为此生气简直荒谬。

Something alerted her to his presence and he was taken in and dismissed all at once, attention put back to her phone with more intent. That plowed a spike under his ribs and he took a half-step in the other direction. A groaning silence took hold of his mind and his step paused.  
某种直觉让她察觉到他的存在，他瞬间被注意到又立刻被忽视，注意力重新集中在她的手机上，更加专注。这在他肋骨下戳了一记，他半步转向另一边。一阵沉闷的沉默笼罩了他的思绪，脚步也随之停顿。

Before he knew it he was slipping a few hundred yen into the nearest machine for a bottle of green tea. Change clattered into the receptacle. He settled on a couch across from Asuka and a coffee table, snapping the cap off. Ceiling fans creaked over their heads, joining the murmuring chorus of news reports and pop music. Thumbing the ridges of the bottle, he decided on a few sips. It was far too bitter.  
不知不觉间，他往最近的自动售货机里塞了几百日元，买了一瓶绿茶。找零叮当作响地落入收币口。他在明日香和一张咖啡桌对面的沙发上坐下，拧开瓶盖。头顶上的吊扇吱嘎作响，加入了新闻报道和流行音乐的低语合唱。他用拇指摩挲着瓶身的棱纹，决定喝上几口。这茶苦得过分。

"Isn't your stuff all moved in by now?" he regarded Asuka, who didn't look up from her phone.  
"你的东西现在应该都搬进来了吧？" 他看着明日香，她没有从手机上抬起头来。

"Yeah, so what?" "是啊，那又怎样？"

He shrugged, eyeing the tantalizing plethora of drinks. Any of which he could have bought instead of this. "I usually go home after tests. I don't really like being here."  
他耸耸肩，目光扫过那诱人的各式饮料。随便哪一种他都可以买，而不是这个。"我通常测试完就回家。我不太喜欢待在这里。"

Asuka sank further into her chair. "Then go already."  
明日香更深地陷进椅子里。“那你就快去吧。”

He sighed through his nose and took several gulps of tea, sloshing it around some and pretending to be preoccupied by the news until he felt he had stayed long enough to not look like a fool for sitting down in the first place. He glanced once more at her, up and down, looking away when she faced him, her glare making the decision for him.  
他鼻子哼了一声，喝了几大口茶，故意晃动杯子，假装专心看新闻，直到觉得坐得够久，不至于显得一开始坐下时像个傻瓜。他再次瞥了她一眼，上下打量，当她转头面对他时，他移开了视线，她的瞪视替他做了决定。

"Where's Zero?" she asked before he could take more than a step.  
“零在哪里？”他还没迈出一步，她就问道。

"I don't know." "我不知道。"

Asuka hummed at that. "Thought you guys were attached at the hip."  
明日香对此轻哼一声。"你们俩不是形影不离吗？"

He shrugged, waiting for her to say something more. Space around them sighed and it felt as though he were facing her through glass, foggy and unnatural like the labs at Gehirn. He started down the hall again.  
他耸了耸肩，等待她继续说些什么。周围的空气仿佛叹息般沉重，感觉就像隔着一层雾蒙蒙的玻璃与她对视，不自然得如同 GEHIRN 的实验室。他再次沿着走廊走去。

"Where are you going?" "你要去哪儿？"

He faltered and swung 'round. "Gym, I guess. Why?"  
他犹豫了一下，转身问道："大概是体育馆吧。怎么了？"

"There's a gym here?" "这里有个健身房？"

"Uh... yeah." "呃... 是的。"

The TV above her persisted, showcasing a series of oil spills off the coast of the Manazuru ruins. Asuka contemplated a vending machine across the way, chewing on her lower lip. Then he was regarded like a questionable piece of meat.  
她头顶的电视持续播放着，展示了一系列马纳兹鲁废墟海岸边的油污泄漏。明日香思索着对面的一台自动售货机，咬着下唇。然后他就像一块可疑的肉一样被审视着。

"What?" "什么？"

"_Nothing_," she spat, falling back behind her phone.  
“没什么，”她啐了一口，退回到手机后面。

"Fine." "好吧。"

Shinji moved on to the on-base gymnasium, tossing out his tea along the way. It was vacant when he arrived, the sounds of those who had just left still echoing in the corners. He went to the benches by the lockers, sitting saddle-horse. Smooth, chalk-splotched mats were laid out nearby in checkerboard patterns of red and blue. Beyond those was a forest of treadmills, dip-bars and smith machines. Mirrors spanned the walls, showcasing their lack of use. Low ceilings ensured every inch of the place was well lit, bathing it in a pale cleanliness.  
真嗣继续前往基地的体育馆，途中把茶扔掉了。他到达时，馆内空无一人，刚离开的人的声音还在角落回响。他走到储物柜旁的凳子前，骑马式坐下。光滑的、沾着粉笔痕迹的垫子铺成红蓝相间的棋盘图案。垫子外是一片跑步机、双杠和史密斯机的森林。镜子覆盖了墙壁，展示着它们的未被使用。低矮的天花板确保了每个角落都光线充足，整个地方沐浴在一种苍白的洁净中。

Shinji fished in a pocket and plugged in the earbuds of his SDAT.  
真嗣从口袋里掏出东西，插上了他的 SDAT 随身听的耳机。

---

His morning sojourn to school began with apprehension, nagging at him during breakfast – even when he found Rei on the trains, and following him all the way to the street corner. Once at school, he and Asuka would acknowledge one another with a cursory glance and go right on through the day without much else.  
他早晨上学途中满怀忐忑，早餐时这不安仍萦绕心头——即便在电车上遇见了丽，这种感觉也一直跟随他到街角。到了学校，他和明日香只会匆匆一瞥，然后各自度过一天，并无太多交集。

Shinji spent it talking with Rei, the two of them listening to Kensuke and Toji go on a tirade about arcade games when there was nothing that needed to be said. Her Unit would be on standby for some time still. Unit-01 always had repair priority.  
真嗣与丽闲聊，两人听着健司和托吉滔滔不绝地谈论街机游戏，尽管并无此必要。丽的零号机会暂时待命一段时间。初号机总是优先修复。

Breakfast at the kitchen table with Misato persisted, each ignorant of the other's presence. Most evenings, when they were in for sync tests, he spied Asuka down the gangway in her red plug suit for a moment as they boarded testing plugs, and then for another as she took up residence in the lounge on that deck afterwards. He bought a green tea, expecting it to taste better every time, and took up a seat nearby while the atmosphere tightened to a knot around his throat. By then he would leave, sit in an empty gym and listen to his SDAT the whole way through before going home.  
在厨房餐桌旁与美里共进早餐，彼此间浑然不觉。大多数晚上，进行同步测试时，他会在登机测试插头时瞥见明日香穿着红色插入栓服站在过道上，随后又在测试结束后见她在休息室里落座。他买了一瓶绿茶，期待每次品尝都能更觉美味，然后找了个附近的座位坐下，此时气氛已紧绷如结，勒得他喘不过气来。那时他会离开，坐在空荡的体育馆里，听着 SDAT 播放整张专辑，直到回家。

It had been seven days since they'd spoken and once again she was sitting in the lounge. Shinji skipped the vending machine and cast his shadow over Asuka, who had sunk further and further into the chair as the days went by. Curled into it now like a cradle as opposed to a proper chair.  
自从他们上次交谈已经过去七天了，她又一次坐在休息室里。真嗣没有去自动售货机，而是将他的影子投在了明日香身上，她随着日子一天天过去，越来越深地陷进椅子里。现在她蜷缩在椅子上，更像是在摇篮里而不是正常的坐姿。

"Sorry," he said, trying to sound sincere.  
“对不起，”他说，试图听起来真诚些。

Her eyes flashed. "What for?"  
她的眼睛闪过一丝光芒。“为了什么？”

"You know. When I yelled at you."  
"你知道的。当我对你大吼大叫的时候。"

Her posture relaxed some, but she brought the phone closer to her face, as if trying to fall into it. "Oh, that? I totally forgot."  
她的姿势稍微放松了一些，但她把手机贴近脸庞，仿佛试图沉浸其中。“哦，那个啊？我完全忘记了。”

"No, you didn't. You held a grudge against me for an entire year once. You didn't forget."  
“不，你没有。你曾经因为一件事对我记恨了整整一年。你不会忘记的。”

Asuka shot to her feet, her body heat a barrier. "Fine, so I didn't, now go away," she said, plopping back down.  
明日香猛地站起身，体温如一道屏障。“好吧，我确实没做，现在走开吧，”她说着，又重重坐下。

His mouth quirked in a flat, unconvinced way, but he didn't feel like arguing. He didn't feel like much of anything. A gut tugging sensation nudged him to stay, maybe take the seat close by or grab something from the machines.  
他的嘴角微微抽动，带着一种平淡且不相信的表情，但他并不想争论。他几乎感觉不到什么。一种牵引内心的感觉促使他留下，或许坐在附近，或者从自动售货机里拿点什么。

Instead, he ended up down in the gym, which greeted him with its numbing cadence. He found his spot on the bench nearest the lockers, submitting to the music of his SDAT after a breath or two of hesitation. The twenty-third track had barely started playing when one of the buds was pulled out. Equal parts startled and annoyed, he turned to stand. Asuka's fist came forward in a push more than a punch. Shinji fore-blocked on reflex. He wasn't prepared for her other hand coming up to shove his shoulder. He staggered, his footing off to begin with, and tumbled ass over elbow on the other side of the bench.  
相反，他最终来到了健身房，那里以麻木的节奏迎接他。他在离储物柜最近的凳子上找到了自己的位置，犹豫了一两口气后，便沉浸在 SDAT 的音乐中。第二十三首曲子刚开始播放，一只耳机就被扯了下来。他既惊讶又恼火，转身站起来。明日香的一拳与其说是攻击，不如说是推搡。真嗣本能地前挡。他没料到她的另一只手会抬起推他的肩膀。他踉跄着，本来就站不稳，结果在长凳的另一边摔了个四脚朝天。

When he scrambled up, he saw Asuka's backside as she swayed over to the mats with her hands clasped behind her back, as innocent as could be. She turned to pin him with those blue eyes.  
当他爬起来时，看到明日香双手背在身后，摇摇晃晃地走向垫子，那模样纯真得不能再纯真。她转过身来，用那双湛蓝的眼睛紧紧盯着他。

_Tag, you're it. 你被盯上了。_

Shinji shot to his feet, aches forgotten.  
真嗣猛地站起身，疼痛都抛诸脑后。

They found sparring equipment, mouth guards and some old rubber blades in the storage bins along the wall. It was a brief task to don their padded helmets, and he paused as she pulled her hair through an opening in the back, where it billowed out like the plume of an ancient helm.  
他们在墙边的储物箱里找到了训练用的护具、护齿和一些旧橡胶刀片。戴上防护头盔只是个简单的任务，当她将头发从后部的开口处穿过时，他停了下来，那头发像古代头盔的羽饰一样蓬松地飘散开来。

They stood several feet apart on the mats. He on red and she on blue.  
他们在垫子上相隔几英尺站立。他站在红色区域，她站在蓝色区域。

"First touch loses," she said, and he nodded.  
“先触碰者输。”她说，他点头表示同意。

He opened with slashes and jabs, embarrassed when he missed all his marks. She timed the right moment to dip inside his guard and drive the rubber hard into his ribs. Next match, smacking across his thigh. Under his arm during the next. By the fourth round Shinji was breathing heavy, and wanted to rip his helmet off and lock himself in his room for a year. She smiled.  
他以连续的劈砍和刺击开场，却在每次落空时感到尴尬。她抓住了恰当的时机，俯身闯入他的防线，将橡胶剑重重击打在他的肋骨上。下一场比赛，她又在他的大腿上猛拍一下。接着在他的腋下再来一击。到了第四轮，真嗣已经气喘吁吁，只想摘下头盔，把自己关在房间里一年。她笑了。

_Never_ had he wanted to take something away so badly.  
他从未如此渴望夺走某样东西。

The fifth match he pitched all his weight forward and ran a shoulder into her stomach. It didn't bother him that he'd floored her. At least, it shouldn't have bothered him. Asuka's smile broke as he let her up, the more serious and infinitely more dangerous girl from their training days coming through. He could _still_ beat her. She couldn't win at everything.  
第五场比赛中，他全力向前冲去，用肩膀撞向她的腹部。他并不介意自己将她击倒。至少，他不应该介意。当真嗣扶她起来时，明日香的笑容消失了，取而代之的是他们训练时那个更严肃、更危险的她。他仍然能打败她。她不可能在所有事情上都赢。

On the sixth bout, she hunted for the sensitive nerves at his wrists and elbows, striking him on the upper forearm hard with a fist. His knife-hand opened on reflex, and just as hers was coming in – he balled his left hand and lashed out, managing to crack his knuckles into hers. Asuka shrieked and staggered back, holding her hand at the wrist.  
在第六轮较量中，她瞄准了他手腕和肘部的敏感神经，用拳头重重击打他的上臂。他的持刀手本能地张开，而就在她的手即将袭来之际——他紧握左拳猛地挥出，成功用指节击中了她的手。明日香尖叫着踉跄后退，手腕紧握着手。

"What the _hell_?!" “搞什么鬼？！”

An iron ball dropped through his gut. Their labored gasps filled every corner. Shinji shook his head, frustration overwhelming him like a pot of boiling water. "Let's just stop."  
他的内心仿佛被铁球重重砸下。两人沉重的喘息声充斥着每个角落。真嗣摇了摇头，沮丧如沸水般淹没了他。“我们还是停下吧。”

He stooped to pick up his knife, only to have Asuka's foot smack atop his palm, digging it between her heel and the rubber hilt.  
他弯腰去捡刀，却被明日香一脚踩在手掌上，鞋跟和橡胶刀柄之间夹得生疼。

"Asuka!" When all she did was press harder, he hugged her leg with his free arm and lurched forward, pushing her off balance. Her back smacked the mats and she rolled half in a daze as she absorbed the ache. Shinji made to get up – when her other leg started aiming kicks at him, his protests lost between her strained grunts. He let go of his grip on her ankle and shoved the appendage away, throwing himself at her. He grabbed for her arms, earning a manacle grip around her wrists, but she rolled onto her back – tucking her legs in and shoving her feet into his stomach. He let his breath free on reflex, mitigating some of the impact. She pushed until he was arched over her, still latched to her wrists. Their shouts and struggles echoed through the gym.  
“明日香！”她不仅没有松开，反而更用力地踩住，他只好用另一只手抱住她的腿，猛地向前一扑，让她失去平衡。她的背部重重地摔在垫子上，半昏半醒地翻滚着，缓解疼痛。真嗣试图起身——但她的另一条腿开始朝他踢来，他的抗议声淹没在她吃力的喘息中。他松开握住她脚踝的手，将那条腿推开，扑向她。他试图抓住她的手臂，结果被她紧紧扣住手腕，但她随即翻身仰卧——双腿蜷缩，双脚猛地蹬向他的腹部。他本能地吐出一口气，减轻了一些冲击。她用力推着他，直到他弓身悬在她上方，依然紧握着她的手腕。他们的喊叫和挣扎声在体育馆内回荡。

Shinji maneuvered himself off balance, sliding between her legs and losing grip. She caught one of his arms readily and he had a moment to be terrified as she grabbed hold with both hands, legs now laid over his chest in an arm lock. With flailing, ugly difficulty, he slid himself vertical instead of horizontal, negating the lock by instead making his face mercy to her feet again.  
真嗣设法让自己失去平衡，从她双腿间滑过并松开了抓握。她迅速抓住他的一只手臂，他有一瞬间感到恐惧，因为她用双手紧紧抓住他，双腿现在压在他的胸前形成了一个手臂锁。他艰难而狼狈地挣扎着，让自己从水平变为垂直，通过这种方式再次让他的脸面对她的脚，从而解除了锁扣。

He couldn't say how long they wrestled. Time didn't seem to move out on the mats, their bodies worked into overdrive and pouring off skin-melting waves of heat. There was biting, scratching, hair-pulling, name-calling, and their protective gear ripped off bit by bit under the abuse. Soon both of them were red and burning from skin twisting against skin. From another perspective, it must have looked no different than a pair of squirrels scraping it out.  
他说不清他们摔跤了多久。在垫子上，时间似乎停滞不前，他们的身体超负荷运转，散发出皮肤融化的热浪。他们互相咬、抓、扯头发、骂人，防护装备在虐待下一点一点地被撕裂。很快，两人都因皮肤相互摩擦而变得通红和灼热。从另一个角度看，这一定和两只松鼠打架没什么两样。

It seemed to take a lifetime, but their energy began to evaporate, each movement drunk with exhaustion – and every inch of him felt like it were made of stiff rock instead of muscle. Asuka was atop his back now, arms wrapped around his neck from behind. Elbows shaking, he pushed off the ground, making a strangled shout from the wobbling effort. Her hair fell into his face and he tried to shake her off by stumbling forward on hands and knees.  
仿佛经历了一生一世，他们的精力开始消散，每一个动作都因疲惫而迟缓——他感觉自己每一寸身体都像是僵硬的岩石而非肌肉。明日香此刻正趴在他的背上，双臂从后面环抱着他的脖子。他颤抖着肘部撑起身体，因摇晃的努力而发出窒息般的喊声。她的头发垂落在他脸上，他试图通过手脚并用地蹒跚前行来甩掉她。

She began to shake. It was a soft sound at first. When her breath caught up, she started laughing.  
她开始颤抖。起初声音很轻。当她的呼吸跟上时，她开始笑了起来。

Maybe it was because he was tired, with so little oxygen and hydration able to reach his addled brain and support his spent limbs. Or maybe it was because of how utterly ridiculous they must have looked.  
也许是因为他太累了，几乎没有氧气和水分能到达他混乱的大脑并支撑他疲惫的四肢。又或许是因为他们看起来实在是太滑稽了。

But he started laughing too.  
但他也开始笑了起来。

Shinji pitched forward, face slapping the cool mats as he fell victim to an uncontrollable fit of gasping laughter, joined by Asuka's breathless giggles that sometimes turned into snorts – and only made him laugh harder. Neither seemed able to stop, and Shinji was starting to see fireflies from lack of air. After long minutes of writhing on the floor, they were at last staring up at the ceiling – feeding starved lungs in heaving pants. When their breathing eased into something normal, and the world stopped spinning, both had time to absorb all of their wounds and sores and headaches. It was no worse than their old play in the garden.  
真嗣向前扑倒，脸颊贴在凉爽的垫子上，陷入了无法控制的喘息笑声中，伴随着明日香喘不过气来的咯咯笑声，有时还会变成喷鼻声——这只会让他笑得更厉害。两人似乎都无法停下来，真嗣因为缺氧开始看到萤火虫。在地板上扭动了许久后，他们终于仰望着天花板——急促地喘息着，满足着饥渴的肺部。当他们的呼吸逐渐恢复正常，世界停止旋转时，两人都有时间去感受所有的伤口和疼痛以及头痛。这并不比他们在花园里的旧时光更糟糕。

"Call it a draw?" She breathed. It was the closest thing to a compromise Asuka had ever offered him.  
“算平局吧？”她喘息着说。这是明日香给他的最接近妥协的提议。

He shook his head. 他摇了摇头。

"Fine." Asuka let her head fall towards him. "Wanna go again?"  
“好吧。”明日香将头转向他，“还想再来一次吗？”

If he could feel the muscles in his face, they might have twitched with a smile. "No, I have to get home."  
如果他能感觉到脸上的肌肉，或许会因为微笑而微微抽动。“不了，我得回家了。”

Her hand flailed out and she pushed on his cheek. "Come ooon."  
她的手胡乱挥舞，推了推他的脸颊。“拜托嘛。”

"No, I gotta go." It took far too much effort to sit up.  
"不，我得走了。" 坐起来费了好大劲。

"Whatever. I just thought you'd like the chance to win your pride back."  
"随你便。我只是觉得你或许想赢回你的尊严。"

"Hah. Against you? That's a losing battle."  
"哈。跟你比？那可是必输无疑的战斗。"

"Then stop losing – loser," she punctuated by shooting him a raspberry.  
"那就别再输了——输家，"她用朝他吐舌头的动作加重了语气。

He grunted, finding his way to the benches on aching legs. "I have a lot of assignments to catch up on, anyway. Misato said she'd take me out to eat if I got my grades up."  
他咕哝着，拖着酸痛的双腿走向长椅。"反正我有很多作业要补。美里说如果我成绩提高，她就带我出去吃饭。"

"Oh, so it's for a date with Misato then?"  
"哦，原来是为了和美里约会啊？"

Shinji shook his head. He was too tired and just blurting things out now. "No. That's not why. I'm not even sure I want to." He picked up his SDAT from the floor and stared into it for a time, the music still playing. He'd always liked Mariya – how she made her sad songs sound so bright and full of color.  
真嗣摇了摇头。他太累了，现在只是随口说出心里话。“不，不是因为这个。我甚至不确定自己是否想要。”他从地上捡起 SDAT，盯着它看了一会儿，音乐仍在播放。他一直喜欢 Maria——她如何让悲伤的歌曲听起来如此明亮且充满色彩。

"Hm," Asuka sighed, still lounging on the floor. "What homework are you working on anyway? I'm still trying to figure out some of the Kanji. Why do the Japanese use such a complicated writing system?"  
“嗯，”明日香叹了口气，依旧懒洋洋地躺在地板上。“你到底在做什么作业？我还在努力理解一些汉字。为什么日本人要用这么复杂的书写系统？”

He shrugged, hearing the music with a new ear. "You're pretty smart. I'm sure you'll get the hang of it."  
他耸耸肩，用一种新的方式聆听音乐。“你很聪明。我相信你会掌握的。”

"Yeah – _thanks for nothing_."  
"是啊——多谢你什么都没做。"

It was the tone that pulled Shinji away from his SDAT, and Asuka was there on her hands and knees as though ready to pounce. She stared at him.  
正是这语气让真嗣从他的 SDAT 上移开了注意力，只见明日香正双手双膝着地，仿佛随时准备扑上来。她盯着他。

"What?" he asked, feeling like he should flick her nose, but also sensing there was something more serious at work. Her lips pursed and the muscles in his face tightened.  
"干嘛？"他问道，感觉自己应该弹一下她的鼻子，但又隐约觉得事情没那么简单。她的嘴唇紧抿，他的面部肌肉也跟着绷紧了。

"You don't need help... right?"  
"你不需要帮助...对吧？"

"No, I don't," she said in a drawn-out way, as though having finished chewing on something rotten.  
"不，我不需要，"她拖长声音说，仿佛刚刚咀嚼完什么腐烂的东西。

She left soon after. 她不久后就离开了。

"_Pattern Orange detected. All hands to battle stations, level one. All hands to battle stations, level one."_  
"橙色警戒模式已检测到。全体人员进入一级战斗岗位，重复，全体人员进入一级战斗岗位。"

Light flickered along the walls, mirroring the heightened sense of urgency the crew of the base moved at, leaving behind lunches, drinks, and games of mahjong to reach their posts. The stampeding personnel parted for Misato, some of the green horns stopping to make a hasty salute.  
灯光沿着墙壁闪烁，映照出基地人员行动中的紧迫感，他们放下午餐、饮料和麻将游戏，奔向各自的岗位。狂奔的人群为美里让路，一些新手匆忙停下敬礼。

"_All non-essential personnel evacuate to your designated shelters, this is not a drill."_  
"所有非必要人员立即撤离至指定避难所，这不是演习。"

She entered the bridge at the middle tier, the command tower rising above her – missing its commander. Fuyutsuki stood poised in the position instead. At the forward CIC, her three specialists ran through data on the holo-screens quicker than she could read it. Ritsuko monitored nearby.  
她步入中层舰桥，指挥塔耸立其上——却不见指挥官的身影。取而代之的是冬月稳稳地站在那里。在前方的 CIC，她的三位专家在全息屏幕上处理数据的速度比她阅读的速度还快。赤木律子在一旁监控着。

"Analysis of the target?" Misato asked, eyeing the grid of the city super-imposed below the main screen.  
“目标分析情况如何？”美里问道，目光扫过主屏幕下方叠加的城市网格。

"Blood Type registers as Orange according to the inherent wavelength," Aoba said, pursing his lips and shaking his head. "The MAGI can't seem to come to a consensus on a Blue reading, not without more data. Target tentatively designated as the Seventh Angel."  
“根据固有波长，血型显示为橙色，”青叶皱着眉摇头说道，“MAGI 系统似乎无法在没有更多数据的情况下达成蓝色读数的一致意见。目标暂定为第七使徒。”

She nodded. "Current heading?"  
她点点头。“当前航向？”

"Location South-East. Zeroing in on coordinates now." Hyuga zoomed the holo-map. "It's established a beachhead at the new Yugawara coast line." On the main screen a bird's eye view from a recon drone showed them the flooded mainland, tops of crooked buildings poking the surface. Spilled atop it all was an ink-black blotch that writhed at the edges like oil in water.  
“东南方向。正在锁定坐标。”日向放大了全息地图。“它在新足柄海岸线建立了一个滩头阵地。”主屏幕上，侦察无人机的鸟瞰视角显示着被洪水淹没的大陆，扭曲的建筑物顶部露出水面。所有这一切之上，是一片如墨般漆黑的斑块，边缘像水中的油一样蠕动。

"It's massive," she said, grinding her teeth. She was down an Evangelion and her other units had just finished repairs. Damn.  
“它非常庞大，”她说着，咬紧牙关。她损失了一台 EVA，而其他单位刚刚完成维修。该死。

Ritsuko glanced at the readings. "So far it's reached a diameter of ten kilometers."  
律子瞥了一眼读数。“到目前为止，它的直径已经达到了十公里。”

"The MAGI picked up whispers in the Manazuru ruins through our listening post in Shiroganeyama this morning. Rapid temperature spikes, abnormal atmospheric gradients, random jumps in PMW signatures."  
“今天早上，MAGI 通过我们在白金山的监听站，在真鹤废墟中捕捉到了低语声。温度急剧上升，异常的大气梯度，PMW 信号的随机跳跃。”

Misato moved to Maya's shoulder as she was motioned over. "For the past few days it's consumed mass in a seven-mile radius and the rate of consumption is increasing hourly."  
美里走到被示意过来的摩耶身边。“过去几天里，它已经吞噬了七英里半径内的物质，并且吞噬速度每小时都在增加。”

Misato fought not to sound exasperated. "How didn't we catch it sooner?"  
美里努力不让自己听起来感到恼火。“我们怎么没能早点发现？”

Hyuga shook his head, at a loss. "Something in its growth cycle that flew under the MAGI's radar."  
日向摇了摇头，不知所措。“它的生长周期中有某些环节逃过了 MAGI 的监测。”

She offered him a grimace and he returned it. Maya threw up a new analysis. "The MAGI project that in six days, seventeen hours, eleven minutes and thirty-seven seconds it will have consumed a third of the Kanto Region."  
她对他露出了一个苦笑，他也回以同样的表情。摩耶展示了一份新的分析报告。“MAGI 预测，在六天十七小时十一分钟又三十七秒后，它将吞噬关东地区三分之一的地域。”

"There's already a prong forming in its growth pattern," Ritsuko said.  
“它的生长模式中已经形成了一个尖角，”律子说道。

"Straight for us," she hummed. A wandering protrusion branched out from the mass, weaving into the valleys near Shiroyama. "Outfit the Evas for ground assault. Has the JSSDF been alerted?"  
“直冲我们而来，”她轻哼一声。一个游离的突起从那团物质中分支出来，蜿蜒进入白山附近的峡谷。“为 Eva 装备地面突击装备。自卫队已经接到警报了吗？”

"Affirmative. Third and Tenth Divisions are mobilizing. Fighter squadrons from Komatsu and Hyakuri will be entering Tokyo-three airspace in twenty minutes." Aoba pressed a hand to his headphones, straining a moment to hear. "Just picked up a broadcast over the E-Band: emergency mobilization of the third, sixth and fifth Air Wings."  
“是的。第三和第十师正在动员。小松和百里基地的战斗机中队将在二十分钟后进入东京三号空域。”青叶按住耳机，努力聆听了一会儿。“刚刚在 E 波段收到广播：第三、第六和第五航空团的紧急动员。”

"For what?" "为了什么？"

"Can't say for sure, but it sounds like they're prepping for a pretty big bombing raid on the Angel."  
"不能确定，但听起来他们好像在为对使徒进行一次大规模的轰炸做准备。"

She thought the JSSDF was done nosing their way into NERV's operations. They should have known by now. Misato turned to the Command Tower. "Sir?"  
她以为日本自卫队已经不再插手 NERV 的事务了。他们应该早就明白了。美里转向指挥塔。"长官？"  
Fuyutsuki allotted the main screen a baleful glare. "Let them proceed. It won't make a difference."  
冬月分配了主屏幕一个恶狠狠的瞪视。“让他们继续。这不会有任何区别。”

"Understood. Configure the city for long-range interception. Prep the Evangelions for aerial insertion. Let's get out there before the Defense Force gets too trigger happy."  
“明白。配置城市进行远程拦截。准备使徒进行空中插入。让我们在防卫部队过于冲动之前出击。”

---

Another squadron of fighter jets, nothing but thin silvery streaks against deep blue, dropped what must have been another few thousand gallons of napalm over a shifting black mass. The fuel mix belched flame to join the wild, bloated fires that already coated the Angel's body, crawling forth bit by bit from the sea. Billowing clouds of white phosphorous mingled with the black smoke of the napalm, the former pouring over what was left of the coastline from the northern winds.  
又一队战斗机，不过是深蓝背景下的纤细银线，投下了必定又是数千加仑的凝固汽油弹，覆盖在一个移动的黑影上。燃料混合物喷发出火焰，加入了已经包裹着使徒身体的狂野、膨胀的火海，它正一点点从海中爬出。滚滚的白磷云与凝固汽油弹的黑烟混合，前者随着北风倾泻在残存的沿海线上。

"_Target in sight,"_ the bomber pilot radioed, just as they passed over Mount Byobu._"Coming up on the drop zone."_  
"目标已锁定," 轰炸机飞行员通过无线电报告，就在他们飞越 Byobu 山时。"即将到达投放区。"

Shinji flexed his fingers around the induction levers. "Roger."  
真嗣紧握着感应杆。"收到。"

Asuka's plug feed sprang up in his, though she was focused on the growing firestorm ahead. "Betcha' I'll land ground-side first," she said.  
尽管明日香专注于前方不断扩大的火风暴，她的插入栓还是在他旁边弹起。"我敢打赌我会先着陆，"她说。

"Only 'cause they made your Eva fat with armor."  
"只是因为他们给你的 Eva 装了厚重的装甲。"

"_Pig_." "猪。"

Misato's window cropped up over hers, whisking it to the side. "Lock it down you two, and listen up. The MAGI have managed a partial on our target. Ritsuko will brief you." In place of Misato a Sound Only display appeared. "I'll keep this short. Based on our wave pattern analysis the Angel exists in a necrotrophic state, much like a fungus. It invades organic material using a combination of mechanical pressure and enzymes and perpetuates growth by using the dead tissue. From satellite imagery and drones, we've been able to discern the Angel uses a kind of acid to break down anything inorganic."  
美里窗口弹出在她的屏幕上，将其推到一边。“你们两个，锁定频道，听好了。MAGI 已经对我们的目标进行了部分解析。律子会向你们简报。”美里的声音只显示在音频上。“我会简短说明。根据我们的波形分析，天使处于一种坏死性状态，很像真菌。它通过机械压力和酶入侵有机物质，并利用死去的组织持续生长。从卫星图像和无人机拍摄的画面中，我们能够辨认出天使使用某种酸来分解无机物。”

"So it can eat through armor," Asuka said.  
“这样它就能穿透装甲了。”明日香说道。

"Correct. Maintain a reasonable distance and probe its defenses."  
“没错。保持适当距离，试探它的防御。”

Shinji stole a look to the right where Asuka's bomber trailed alongside his, just a hair behind. Already mounted to her arm was a positron rifle and to her hip a pair of 8-cell charge packs. They'd given him a pallet rifle and a tomahawk. It seemed he was expected to get in close.  
真嗣偷偷向右瞥了一眼，明日香的轰炸机紧随其后，仅落后一丝。她的手臂上已经装上了一支阳电子步枪，腰间挂着一对八单元充电包。他们给了他一把托盘步枪和一把战斧。看来他得靠近作战。

Misato's face replaced the sound-only barrier. "Our batteries at Shiroyama and Makuyama can support you for immediate effect. All other support fire from base comes with a longer delay, so keep that in mind once you're on the ground."  
美里将她的面孔取代了仅有的语音屏障。“白山和真山的发电站可以立即为你们提供支援。基地其他支援火力会有较长的延迟，所以一旦降落，请牢记这一点。”

"Got it," Asuka said. Shinji remained quiet, but Misato had already cut her visual feed. Clouds of phosphorous lurked below, lit with a blistering inferno. Through the patches he could see a twinkling black. He wished Rei was there.  
“明白，”明日香回应道。真嗣依旧沉默，但美里已经切断了她的视频信号。下方磷光闪烁，烈焰如焚。透过云层间隙，他能看到闪烁的黑暗。他希望丽能在那里。

"_Movement from the target."_  
“目标有动静。”

The bomber lurched, the Angel's fluid mass spattering the undercarriage keeping the Evangelion anchored. Shinji realized that the twinkling was light bouncing off its shifting body as another wave of gelatinous orbs rose from the storm and streaked towards them. They traveled too fast for the slow-moving bomber to evade, the transport jarring again as the left wing was peppered with impacts. An unseen blast rattled the frame.  
轰炸机猛地一晃，天使那流动的躯体溅洒在固定着福音战士的底盘上。真嗣意识到那闪烁的光芒是光线在其不断变化的身躯上反射的结果，又一波胶状球体从风暴中升起，朝他们疾驰而来。它们的速度之快，让行动迟缓的轰炸机无法躲避，运输机再次震动，左翼被连续击中。一阵看不见的爆炸震动了机身。

"_Hull breach. Left side stabilizer fins are gone."_ the co-pilot said, voice tight with tension. Their trajectory started to shift. _"Engine failure!"_  
“船体破损，左侧稳定翼已失。”副驾驶紧张地说道，声音紧绷。他们的飞行轨迹开始偏移。“引擎故障！”

Another salvo slapped the body of Asuka's bomber.  
又一排炮火击中了明日香驾驶的轰炸机。

"_Drop now – launch, launch!"_  
“现在放下——发射，发射！”

From the corner of his eye he saw Unit-02 slip from the railings and sink towards the ground. Shinji, linked with the onboard computer, triggered the release on the right induction lever.  
他用眼角余光瞥见二号机从栏杆滑落，向地面沉去。真嗣与机载电脑相连，触发了右侧引导杆的释放。

Rack Line Jammed. 挂架线路堵塞。

"What?" He ticked the release again. The right wing of his craft lilted.  
"什么？" 他又按了一次释放键。他的飞行器右翼倾斜了。

Rack Line Jammed. 弹药架卡住了。

"_Shinji, eject from the bomber!"_  
"真嗣，从轰炸机上弹射出去！"

"I can't _–_ it's stuck!"  
"我打不开——它卡住了！"

"_Shit – hang on back there!"_ The pilot did what he could to glide them down, but he couldn't have had much control of the thing, not with the left wing torn to pieces. It wasn't long before they entered a spiral – but even then, it took them too long to fall. Shinji had every nerve-wracking moment to witness the black Angel consume his viewport. From the external sound feed he could hear the noise of the remaining engines rising in pitch as they plummeted faster and faster.  
"该死——后面的人抓紧！" 飞行员尽力让飞机滑翔下降，但左翼被撕成碎片，他对飞机的控制力有限。不久后，他们进入了螺旋下降——但即便如此，坠落的过程也显得过于漫长。真嗣有足够的时间，每一刻都紧张得要命，眼看着黑色使徒吞噬了他的视野。从外部声音反馈中，他能听到剩余引擎的噪音随着他们加速下坠而越来越高。

There was the start of a scream from the cockpit, and then a blast – like the backfiring of a car. Metal crashed and Shinji pitched forward against his harness. Static buzzed over the viewport, he was weightless, up until the bomber finished its flip. The other wing burst off, an explosion rattling him to the bone. Another impact, he was thrown into the side of the command suite. Voices howled in the LCL.  
驾驶舱里传来一声尖叫的开始，接着是一声爆炸——就像汽车回火一样。金属撞击声响起，真嗣被安全带向前甩去。静电噪音覆盖了视野，他感到失重，直到轰炸机完成翻转。另一侧机翼炸裂，爆炸震得他骨头发颤。又一次撞击，他被甩到了指挥舱的侧壁上。LCL 中回荡着人们的尖叫声。

He wasn't sure when the plane stopped moving, vibrations reverberating in his muscles. One of the right-side panels snow-screened, alerts water-falling on the left side of his HUD. A message still blinked at him in large red letters. Rack Line Jammed.  
他不记得飞机何时停下的，肌肉中还残留着震颤。右侧的一个面板被雪花屏覆盖，警告信息如瀑布般在他的 HUD 左侧倾泻而下。一条信息仍以大红字在他眼前闪烁。弹药架线路堵塞。

"_Shi-"_ “该死——”

"_Shinj... hear me?"_ “新治……能听到我吗？”

He commanded the Evangelion to stand, the internal motors humming as his sync-rate tethered tighter. Invisible strands spiraled from the nerve clips and wove through his brain. Command's transmissions came in just a litter clearer.  
他命令福音战士站立，内部电机嗡嗡作响，同步率更加紧密地束缚着他。无形的丝线从神经夹中螺旋而出，穿透他的大脑。指挥部的传输信号变得稍微清晰了一些。

"_Unit-two attached to mobile power unit. Umbilical secured."_  
“二号机已连接移动电源单元。脐带电缆已固定。”

"_We've lost visual of Unit-one."_  
“我们失去了对一号机的视觉信号。”

Unit-01 met resistance as it stood, like someone were pushing on his shoulders. He pushed in kind. Part of the bomber crumpled, tearing away from the Eva's back where the railings kept superstructure and torched metal planted to his armor. A hand reached to his left pauldron, only to find the outer casing crushed.  
初号机站立时遭遇阻力，仿佛有人正按住他的肩膀。他同样用力回推。一部分轰炸机结构在他背后崩塌，栏杆将燃烧的金属牢牢固定在 EVA 的装甲上。一只手伸向他的左肩甲，却发现外壳已被压碎。

"Prog-knife's out," he said, hoping someone could hear him. A damage report told him the comms tower was crippled too. His pallet rifle was gone, all he had was the Tomahawk. A timer tone sounded and the plug pitched red. Five minutes of power remaining. A cold shard sank into his heart. No back up power supply, stranded in the middle of a thing - an Angel. A fog of phosphorous consumed his vision, illuminated by rolling swells of fire. Unit-01 took a step forward, the armored boot sinking into a black mire. Shinji lifted the other foot, or attempted to, looking back to find it plunging into the body of the Angel.  
“进度刀已出，”他说，希望有人能听到。一份损坏报告显示通讯塔也已瘫痪。他的弹匣步枪不见了，只剩下战斧。计时器响起，插入栓转为红色。剩余电量五分钟。一股寒意刺入他的心脏。没有备用电源，被困在这中间——一个天使。一片磷光雾气吞噬了他的视野，火浪翻滚中闪烁着光芒。初号机向前迈出一步，装甲靴陷入一片黑色泥沼。真嗣抬起另一只脚，或试图抬起，回头一看，却发现它正陷入天使的身体。

The comms rippled with static. _"The Angel's made contact with Unit-one!"_  
通讯中充斥着静电噪音。“天使与初号机接触了！”

Black clumps swelled and gripped tight. Shinji launched the back-mounted boosters, tugging on the substance before the shallow fuel cells were gone and Unit-01 smacked into the muck, arms dipping in up to the elbow. Glittering flecks of energy spread outward from the contact points, a screeching wail piercing into the plug.  
黑色块状物膨胀并紧紧抓住。真嗣启动了背部助推器，在浅层燃料电池耗尽前拉扯着那物质，初号机猛地撞进泥沼，双臂陷入直至肘部。闪烁的能量碎片从接触点向外扩散，刺耳的尖叫声穿透插入栓。

_"Pattern Blue confirmed!"  
“蓝色模式确认！”_

"I've spread my A.T. field, haven't I?" he said, focusing on the mechanism again. A gauge told him it was at maximum. Unit-01 tugged and jerked, its armor groaning from the strain. "W-what's happening? I can't move!"  
“我已经展开了 A.T.力场，对吧？”他再次集中精神于机制上。一个仪表告诉他力场已达到最大值。初号机拖拽并猛拉，装甲因压力而发出呻吟。“发、发生了什么？我动不了！”

_"We need to get the pilot out of there, ej_–_"_  
"我们得把飞行员救出来，弹射–"

"_No! Those fires are burning at five-thousand degrees. The plug won't be able to survive that if it doesn't land outside the firestorm."_  
"不行！那些火焰温度高达五千度。如果不在火风暴外着陆，逃生舱根本撑不住。"

"_Can it even clear the Angel's mass?"_  
"它能避开使徒的质量吗？"

"_Unlikely."_ "不太可能。"

"Hey! Can anyone hear me?! Misato!"  
"嘿！有人能听到我吗？！美里！"

Unit-01's armor readings sprang up. An integrity warning? It was just the ablative layers, but...  
初号机的装甲读数突然飙升。是完整性警告吗？只是烧蚀层的问题，但...

"_Shinji, come... you there?"_  
"真嗣，来...你在吗？"

"Misato?" he said, a shiver in his voice.  
"美里小姐？" 他的声音带着颤抖。

"_How are his vitals looking?"_  
"他的生命体征如何？"

"_Increased heart rate, otherwise reading green."_  
"心率上升，其他指标正常。"

"_Shinji... you can... to minimal gain mode. We're working on getting Asuka to you."_  
"真嗣...你可以...切换到最小增益模式。我们正在设法让明日香过去找你。"

In the distance he could hear the sharp whine and thump of the positron rolling in rapid succession.  
远处，他能听到正电子炮连续快速滚动的尖锐呼啸和撞击声。

"_I don't care if the... get Unit-zero ready, now._"  
"我不在乎如果...让零号单位准备好，现在。"

"_All batteries, HEAT in effect, danger close."_  
"所有电池，热效应生效，危险接近。"

That was it then, they wanted him to wait. They wanted him to sit there and just...  
就这样了，他们要他等待。他们要他坐在那里，只是...

Unit-01's plug chirped, reminding him again how little power he had left. Shinji triggered the phase-out. Spectrums of color blossomed over the panels, a low moan fading to white noise as the main control circuit powered down.  
初号机的插入栓发出鸣叫，再次提醒他剩余电量有多么少。真嗣启动了断电程序。面板上绽放出色彩斑斓的光谱，低沉的呻吟声逐渐淡化为白噪音，主控制电路随之关闭。

It wasn't long before he could hear the muffled pounding of 155mm shells hammering the Angel's mass. All else was muted, allowing the plug's soft undertones to come to the surface. They hummed and whirred, each a small part of the Eva's symphony. The thrum of the command suite clicked and chittered. Shinji bore into the plug-depth, dimly lit and punctuated with the point where the seams of metal met. Its rhythmic cadence poured over him, lording over all else.  
不久后，他就能听到 155 毫米炮弹沉闷的轰击声，敲打着使徒的躯体。其他一切声音都被压抑，让插入栓的柔和低音浮现出来。它们嗡嗡作响，每一个都是 EVA 交响乐的小小组成部分。指挥部的震动声咔嗒作响。真嗣深入插入栓内部，昏暗的光线中，金属接缝处清晰可见。其节奏韵律倾泻而下，凌驾于一切之上。

He couldn't eject. Even if the napalm dispersed, a remnant of the bomber was still latched to Unit-01's back, covering the hatch. Knees to his chest, Shinji slipped his hands over his ears. "God, I hate this," he hissed, pushing his palms flat. The plug's droning lull became louder, enveloping his person, reverberating in his lungs.  
他无法弹出。即使凝固汽油弹散开，轰炸机的一部分仍紧贴在初号机背部，覆盖着舱口。真嗣蜷缩着双腿，双手捂住耳朵。“上帝，我讨厌这样，”他低声咒骂，手掌紧贴头部。插入栓的嗡鸣愈发响亮，将他整个人包裹其中，回荡在他的肺腑之间。

Time bled out. Minutes took hours to pass. The digital clock built into his suit became a close friend. He kept it so near he could count each of the pixelated blocks. Somewhere, he found the wherewithal to sit up and bring the Unit out of minimal gain. He couldn't remember how long he'd actually been sitting there.  
时间在流逝。几分钟如同几小时般漫长。他战衣内置的数字时钟成了亲密的伙伴。他让它近在咫尺，以至于能数清每一个像素块。不知何处，他找到了坐起来的力气，将单位从最小增益中唤醒。他不记得自己究竟在那里坐了多久。

Deep blue clouds churned above, the horizon dimming with fire-light. The landscape was much as before, but the fires and smoke had cleared – replaced by a fog of debris from artillery. Comms attempted an auto-connect to command.  
深蓝色的云层在上空翻滚，地平线被火光逐渐吞噬。景色依旧，但火焰和烟雾已消散——取而代之的是炮火留下的碎片雾霾。通讯设备尝试自动连接指挥中心。

"_Unit-one's... back online."_  
“一号单位……重新上线了。”

The connection was so thick with static he had to strain to understand, but it would do.  
信号中的静电噪音如此厚重，他不得不费力去理解，但勉强还能应付。

"_Shinji?"_ "真嗣？"

"Misato." He glanced at his timer. "Are you able to reach me?"  
“美里。”他瞥了一眼计时器。“你能联系到我吗？”

Sound only. _"No... any mass we burn off grows back quicker. The Commander's ordered an A-17 to be put into effect."_  
只有声音。“不行……我们消耗掉的任何质量都会更快地恢复。指挥官已经下令实施 A-17 计划。”

"He's not even here." "他甚至不在这里。"

A pause. "_He's still the Commander."_  
一阵停顿。"他仍然是指挥官。"

"He's never _here_." "他从不在这里。"

"_Shinji_–_"_ "真嗣——"

He flicked the conversion switch, terminating the Plug-HUD and all signal transmission. "I don't want to hear it. I hate this thing. I hate this place. Why can't you do anything?" he snarled, shaking the induction levers. Another question rang in his thoughts. But that was far too painful to speak out loud, even if it was just to himself.  
他轻触转换开关，终止了插头式 HUD 和所有信号传输。“我不想听。我讨厌这东西。我讨厌这个地方。为什么你什么都做不了？”他咆哮着，摇晃着感应操纵杆。另一个问题在他脑海中回响。但那太痛苦了，即使只是对自己说出口，也难以启齿。

Little things plucked at the tiny sensors beneath his skin, tickling like a swarm of ants. They crawled and bit, nesting under his flesh to peel and tug at his nerves. He scratched at the plug-suit, digging to reach the skin beneath and make it stop. Black terrors from his nightmares came, swarming about him as he swung and cut and struggled.  
微小的触感在他皮肤下的微型传感器上跳动，像一群蚂蚁般搔痒。它们爬行、叮咬，在他的肉体下筑巢，剥离并拉扯着他的神经。他抓挠着插头服，试图触及下面的皮肤，让这种感觉停止。来自噩梦的黑色恐怖袭来，在他挥舞、切割和挣扎时围绕着他。

Before he could stop himself, Shinji brought Unit-01 to optimal gain, the timer ticking away once more. He didn't see it. All he knew was that he needed to get out. He needed to fight. To do something – anything but be eaten alive.  
在自我阻止之前，真嗣将初号机调至最佳增益状态，计时器再次滴答作响。他并未察觉。他只知道他需要逃离。他需要战斗。做些什么——任何事，只要不被活活吞噬。

Metal strained and he ground his teeth together to fight the pressure tightening his sympathetic bond. In the distance he could hear the reports of a positron rifle again. Had they ever stopped? The hydraulics groaned, strands of the black fluid stretching – tearing. Several snapped, Unit-01's right arm ripped free, trailing bits of mire that still clung to him. Where there had been armor, now there was a melting mesh of circuitry and pale tissue, fibers from artificial muscle exposed from being eaten away at. Shinji snatched the tomahawk from his thigh plating, chopping the high-frequency edge into the Angel. A howl answered him and he brought it over his head for another blow.  
金属发出呻吟，他紧咬牙关抵抗着加剧的共感压力。远处，他再次听到了阳电子步枪的射击声。它们从未停歇吗？液压系统呻吟着，黑色液体的细丝拉伸——撕裂。几根断裂，初号机的右臂被撕扯下来，拖着仍附着的泥泞碎片。原本装甲的地方，现在是一片熔化的电路和苍白组织的网状物，人工肌肉纤维因被侵蚀而暴露。真嗣从大腿装甲上抽出战斧，用高频刃劈向使徒。一声嚎叫回应了他，他再次举起战斧准备重击。

Shapes boiled from the surface, gelatinous orbs rising en-masse and streaking towards him. They spattered Unit-01, some of it splashing over the entry hatch. As it did the pieces of the Angel spilled and fell to reunite with the body, the bonded strands pulling his Eva lower.  
形态从表面沸腾而出，大量凝胶状球体集体升起并向他疾驰而来。它们溅在初号机上，有些甚至飞溅到插入栓上。随着这些碎片洒落并重新融入使徒的身体，结合的细丝将他的 EVA 拉得更低。

"_Cellular damage increasing!"_  
"细胞损伤加剧！"

"_It's transitioned to a biotrophic attack. The Angel is trying to create a mutualistic bond with the Evangelion!"_  
"它已经转变为生物寄生攻击。使徒正试图与福音战士建立共生关系！"

Unit-01 clawed at its face, tearing the body of Angel from the head casing. More of it lanced out from the mass to latch on to him, tethering him tighter the more he struggled. From the corner of his eye, the timer seemed to pick up speed with every lost second. In just thirty seconds he'd be out of power.  
初号机用爪子撕扯着自己的脸部，试图将使徒的躯体从头部外壳上剥离。更多的触须从那团物质中伸出，紧紧缠绕住他，他越是挣扎，束缚就越紧。在他眼角的余光中，计时器似乎随着每一秒的流逝而加速。只需三十秒，他的能量就会耗尽。

After his first battle, Shinji would wonder – in those still hours between awake and sleeping – what his moment of death would feel like. Would he scream? Would he cry? Would he be overcome with terror or regret? What would his final thoughts be? Staring that moment in the face, he found himself thinking of his mother. Shouldn't she have been there? Shouldn't she have been at his back, there to help him escape this impossible moment?  
在第一次战斗之后，真嗣会在那些清醒与睡梦之间的静谧时刻，思索自己的死亡时刻会是什么感觉。他会尖叫吗？会哭泣吗？会被恐惧或悔恨淹没吗？他的最后念头会是什么？直面那一刻，他发现自己想起了母亲。她不应该在那里吗？她不应该在他身后，帮助他逃离这个不可能的时刻吗？

Someone. 某个人。

Anyone. 任何人。

"_Stop wasting time, you idiot!"_  
"别浪费时间了，你这个白痴！"

But it was already too late.  
但为时已晚。

---

Rei watched an illusionary force play upon the stage at the edge of her toes. Within its square frame, an Evangelion – Unit-01 – succumbed to the will of an Angel. Dark tendrils wrapped around it, ready to make them one. Far from the epi-center, the second Unit attempted to plow its way across the Angel, walking as though through a thick mud. Its positron rifle burrowed deep holes in the body.  
丽看着一股虚幻的力量在她脚尖边缘的舞台上上演。在其方形的框架内，一台 EVA——零壹机——屈服于使徒的意志。黑暗的卷须缠绕着它，准备将它们合为一体。远离震中，第二台 EVA 试图穿过使徒，行走如同穿越厚重的泥沼。它的阳电子步枪在使徒的身体上钻出深深的孔洞。

A counter in the corner of the screen reached the zero marker.  
屏幕角落的计数器抵达了零标记。

There was a flare of light – and what appeared to be bright red eyes. Unit-01 struggled against the Angel, pulling at the bonds and ripping their lynching grip. It managed to stand despite the pull, its invader casting more of itself against the machine. Unit-01's eyes glowed, despite having run out of power minutes ago, and its jaw parted. The Evangelion threw its head back and let loose a shrill scream.  
一道光芒闪现——似乎是鲜红的眼睛。初号机与使徒搏斗，挣脱束缚，撕裂了绞杀的钳制。尽管受到牵引，它仍设法站立，入侵者将更多自身投射向机体。初号机的眼睛闪烁着光芒，尽管几分钟前已耗尽电力，它的下巴张开。福音战士仰头，发出一声尖锐的嚎叫。

Israfel's body shifted, coalescing about the Eva in a swirling torrent of fluid, rising and rising in a cone around the Unit until it resembled a mountain. She became anxious, though she already knew what was about to happen. Another flare of light, a brief flash of veined wings, and bits of the Angel were scattered across the coastline. Unit-01 collapsed forward, catching itself on both hands. It crawled over the smoldering remnants of the Angel's attack in a way reminiscent of a spider.  
伊斯拉斐尔的身体变换，围绕着 EVA 形成一股旋转的流体，不断上升，直至形成一座山峰般的锥形。她感到焦虑，尽管她已预知即将发生的事。又一道光芒闪现，短暂的脉络翅膀闪现，使徒的碎片散落在海岸线上。初号机向前倒下，用双手支撑住自己。它像蜘蛛一样爬过使徒攻击留下的冒烟残骸。

Its hands dipped into what remained of Israfel, the black substance swirling over the Eva's crippled limbs – becoming the components to replace its flesh and armor. A scream answered it, exciting the Unit further. It crouched low, one hand dipping into the body of the Angel. Its chemistry changed, bent to the will of the berserk Evangelion. Its mass congealed, splitting with cracks and fissures. Blue seeped from the wounds. Unit-01's body began to bloat, bursting out of the armor. Swells of muscle and skin writhed.  
它的双手探入伊斯拉斐尔残存的躯体，黑色物质在 EVA 的残肢上翻涌——化作替换其血肉和装甲的部件。一声尖叫回应了它，激起了 Unit 更深的兴奋。它蹲伏下来，一只手探入天使的体内。其化学成分改变，屈从于狂暴的 EVA 的意志。它的质量凝结，裂开一道道裂缝。蓝色从伤口中渗出。Unit-01 的身体开始膨胀，撑破了装甲。肌肉和皮肤的隆起扭曲着。

"What is the current status of the Unit?" The Commander asked. He tracked the movements of the recording with an intensity she'd never witnessed, or perhaps never noticed. It reminded her of what Shinji looked like when he fought the other boys at school. Was it excitement? Unit-01 snared a handful of the clumping mass, blue blood splashing over its teeth and spilling down its chin as it bit into the ripe flesh.  
“Unit 目前状况如何？”指挥官问道。他紧盯着录像中的动作，那份专注她从未见过，或许只是未曾留意。这让她想起了真嗣在学校与其他男孩打架时的样子。是兴奋吗？Unit-01 抓住了一团凝结的物质，蓝色的血液溅在它的牙齿上，顺着下巴流淌，当它咬进那饱满的血肉时。

"Confined to stasis and undergoing analysis," Doctor Akagi said, the display reflecting in her glasses. Unit-01 began ripping at pieces of the Angel.  
“处于静止状态并正在进行分析，”赤木博士说，显示屏的光线映在她的眼镜上。Unit-01 开始撕扯天使的碎片。

Fuyutsuki watched. "And the Seventh Angel?"  
冬月观察着。“那第七天使呢？”

"Deteriorating at a rapid rate, but we've managed to isolate a few samples."  
“正在迅速恶化，但我们设法隔离了一些样本。”

"Stop the recording," Ikari said, and Unit-01 froze in the middle of gorging itself.  
"“停止录制，”碇司令命令道，零号机随即在狼吞虎咽的中途停了下来。”

Fuyutsuki squinted. "Was Unit-one allowed to take an S-two engine into itself?"  
冬月眯起了眼睛。“初号机被允许吸收 S-2 引擎吗？”

"It couldn't have." Akagi's eyes shot up to meet his. "This Angel's S-two engine didn't manifest in a structure that would be easy to take advantage of. The fact that it tried is..." Something in her posture changed, a knot of worry removed as quickly as it had come. "Either way, our diagnostics of the Unit didn't turn up anything abnormal."  
“不可能。”赤木律子的目光猛地抬起，与他对视。“这个使徒的 S-2 引擎并没有以易于利用的结构显现。它试图这样做的事实是……”她姿势中的某种紧张感迅速消散，如同刚出现时一样快。“无论如何，我们对初号机的诊断并未发现任何异常。”

"Has Captain Katsuragi been debriefed?" Ikari asked, only present enough to dissect his surroundings for information. Rei herself had no need to be there, her presence on the periphery. An afterthought brought about by happenstance. She quirked her head at the display, as if that would give her a better perspective.  
“葛城上尉已经汇报过了吗？”碇源堂问道，他的存在仅限于从周围环境中提取信息。绫波零本身并不需要在那里，她的出现只是偶然的边缘存在。她歪着头看向显示屏，仿佛这样能让她看得更清楚。

"Yes. The report will mention a decoding error in the neural uplink system. A pile-up of negative feedback."  
"是的。报告中会提到神经连接系统中的解码错误。大量负面反馈堆积。"

"Very good. Expunge this data. Fuyutsuki, please take care of the rest."  
"很好。清除这些数据。冬月，请处理剩下的部分。"

He did not ask about Shinji before departing and she was not ordered to fall in step, feeling herself move as if to follow. The hiss of the door sealing shut left her with a gnawing pit in her stomach.  
他在离开前没有询问真嗣的情况，而她也没有被命令跟随，却感觉自己仿佛要跟上去。门缓缓关闭的嘶嘶声让她心中涌起一阵不安。

Akagi came to stand near, waiting. "It's time for your baseline test."  
赤木来到近旁，等待着。“是时候进行你的基准测试了。”

Rei nodded, but was between places. Between thoughts and emotions. He'd opened himself to it, and she pondered if knowing would have helped him. If he had ever needed that. When does a person need help to keep from disappearing? She saw how he watched the others while they were at school, or sitting on the train, or walking down crowded streets. There was something like longing in his eyes, a loneliness. He seemed caught in a stasis, somehow, and the more he occupied her space, the more attuned to it she became.  
丽点了点头，但心神不定。介于思绪与情感之间。他已向其敞开心扉，她思索着，若早知这一切是否会对他有所帮助。他是否曾需要过那种帮助。一个人何时需要帮助以免消失？她注意到他在学校时，或坐在火车上，或走在拥挤的街道上，是如何观察其他人的。他的眼中流露出一丝渴望，一种孤独。他似乎陷入了某种停滞，而他在她空间中占据得越多，她就越能感受到这一点。

"The Committee isn't going to like this," the Sub-Commander said, boring into the image at his feet. Her gaze lingered there too, captured by the visage of Unit-01 poised to take another bite from the black heart in its hand. Like the hideous fruit of an unspeakably evil tree.  
“委员会不会喜欢这个的，”副司令说道，目光紧盯着他脚下的影像。她的视线也停留在那里，被零壹号机准备再次从手中黑色心脏咬下一口的姿态所吸引。宛如一棵不可言喻的邪恶之树上结出的丑陋果实。

---

_It was a broken home. Dense mold crept up the foundations, termites making deep burrows in the soft woods. But even they had abandoned it at some point, the place no longer a nourishment as water from rampant, unchecked storms seeped into the cracks and peeled the paint and rotted it to the core. It leaned to one side, perhaps one barreling wind away from toppling. Swells of rushing air whistled through the shattered windows, carrying the faint echoes of stifled sobs. Shinji looked over his shoulder, back into the garden. Her hazy figure remained where it was, and he sensed she wanted him to go inside.  
这是一个破败的家。浓密的霉菌爬上了地基，白蚁在柔软的木材中挖掘深洞。但即便它们也在某个时刻放弃了这里，这个地方不再滋养生命，因为肆虐无阻的风暴带来的雨水渗入裂缝，剥落了油漆，从内到外腐烂。它倾斜向一边，或许只需一阵狂风就能将其吹倒。汹涌的气流穿过破碎的窗户，携带着微弱的压抑哭泣声的回音。真嗣回头望向花园。她朦胧的身影依旧停留在原地，他感觉到她希望他进入屋内。_

_White rocks crunched under his Kloster loafers. They scuffed the wood of the front porch, a paper screen door barring his path, the lining ripped free by a tantrum or mother nature, or perhaps both. He slid it open, allowing him to see a hallway leading to a modest common room. Cicadas buzzed, their pitch rising. A small silhouette, dark from the light of afternoon cast on it from the kitchen window, stood near the hall.  
白色的石子在他的克洛斯特便鞋下嘎吱作响。它们刮擦着前门廊的木板，一张纸屏风门挡住了他的去路，衬里被发脾气或大自然，或是两者共同撕裂。他滑开门，看到了通往一间普通客厅的走廊。蝉鸣声响起，音调逐渐升高。一个小小的身影，在厨房窗户透出的午后阳光下显得暗淡，站在走廊附近。_

The ceiling of his room was a nice change from the cold, metallic radiance of the Limbic Quarantine Block.  
他房间的天花板与冰冷、金属光泽的边缘隔离区相比，是一个不错的改变。

That imagined moment stuck in his mind's eye. It wasn't like the nightmares, which had abated some, now lurking on his periphery. He recalled drowning – disappearing into the Angel - and then there was that home and the shadow he knew. Sleep wouldn't take him, despite the ache of his eyes. He'd had plenty of time to sleep in iso. For days, they'd told him. In debriefing, Deck Officer Mibu said he killed the Angel. He'd won, somehow.  
那个想象的瞬间深深烙印在他的脑海中。与那些已有所缓解、如今潜伏在边缘的噩梦不同。他记得自己溺水——消失在使徒体内——然后是那个家和那个他熟悉的影子。尽管眼睛酸痛，睡眠却拒绝降临。他在隔离室里已经睡够了。他们告诉他，已经过了好几天。在汇报中，三尉美里说他杀死了使徒。不知怎么地，他赢了。

That night, Shinji came home in the musty summer air. After a week the apartment was still a mess, dust creeping ever further over every surface. Particles of it floated in the stagnant artificial light. Misato's door was closed and he checked his phone several times. There were a few meals prepared for him in the fridge, an amalgam of steamed rice and curry noodles. He ate until he felt like throwing up and sat in the bathroom for a while, just in case he did. PenPen, stirring at the sounds of someone about, waddled in and slipped his head under one of Shinji's arms. He scratched the penguin and listened to him coo.  
那晚，真嗣在闷热的夏夜中回到家。一周过去了，公寓依旧一片狼藉，灰尘悄然覆盖了每一处表面。微粒在停滞的人工光线下飘浮。美里房间的门紧闭着，他多次查看手机。冰箱里有几顿为他准备的饭菜，混合着蒸米饭和咖喱面条。他吃到想吐，然后在浴室里坐了一会儿，以防万一。听到动静的 PenPen 蹒跚而来，把头钻到真嗣的一只胳膊下。他轻挠着企鹅，听着它咕咕叫。

The moment between then and standing in front of her door blurred together. PenPen was down the hall slurping at fish, his bowl scratching the linoleum.  
那时与站在她门前的瞬间模糊成一片。PenPen 在走廊尽头吸溜着鱼，它的碗在油毡上刮擦着。

"Is Misato coming home tonight?" He asked. A pale sliding door stared back at him, a black scuff mark at its corner from when he and Misato had grappled over the remote once. Shinji's feet carried him to bed, where he lay fully dressed, waiting for burning eyes to close.  
“美里今晚回家吗？”他问道。一扇苍白的推拉门回望着他，角落里有一块黑色的划痕，那是他和美里争夺遥控器时留下的。真嗣的双脚带他走向床铺，他穿着衣服躺下，等待着灼热的双眼闭上。

His phone on the nightstand buzzed, and he considered it like one might an overgrown weed on the sidewalk. When had it gone from 1 am to 7? Glancing at the screen, it was not a number he recognized. So he held the thing as it kept to its muffled ring, begging for attention.  
床头柜上的手机嗡嗡作响，他像对待人行道上的一株茂盛野草那样考虑着它。时间怎么从凌晨 1 点变成了 7 点？瞥了一眼屏幕，他并不认识这个号码。于是他拿着手机，任由它持续发出低沉的铃声，渴望着关注。

After three more rings, he tapped to answer and touched it to one ear. "Hello?"  
又响了三声后，他轻触接听，将手机贴在耳边。“喂？”

"Did you just wake up?"  
“你刚醒吗？”

Shinji jerked at the sudden volume. "Yeah – who is this?"  
真嗣被突如其来的音量吓了一跳。“嗯——你是谁？”

"What do you mean who is this? Who else would call you?"  
"你这是什么意思，谁会给你打电话？"

Of course, it was Asuka. A wrinkle formed on his brow.  
当然，是明日香。他的眉头皱了起来。

"How did you get my number?"  
"你怎么会有我的号码？"

"I asked Misato for it."  
"我向美里要的。"

"Oh. Okay. What do you want?"  
"哦，好的。你想要什么？"

A pause filled the line and Shinji found the strength somewhere to sit up. There was great effort in Asuka's tone. "Kanji. Teach me."  
电话那头停顿了一下，真嗣不知从哪里找到了力量坐起身来。明日香的声音里透着极大的努力。"汉字。教我。"

"I'm not going to school today."  
"我今天不去上学了。"

"That has nothing to do with what I just said. And why? You're already a week behind because of that dumb quarantine. This is why your grades are terrible–"  
"这跟我刚才说的没关系。而且为什么不去？你已经因为那愚蠢的隔离落后一周了。这就是你成绩糟糕的原因——"

He held the phone away from his ear for a minute until it sounded like she had finished. "Did Misato tell you about my grades too?"  
他把手机从耳边拿开一会儿，直到听起来她似乎说完了。“美里也跟你说了我的成绩吗？”

"No. Without me to make you put in effort, they always take a nosedive-"  
"不行。没有我督促你努力，他们总是会一落千丈——"

"It's not like I need to know that stuff for Eva."  
"我又不是为了伊娃才需要知道那些东西。"

"-And I've already graduated University, but if _I_ have to go, _you_ have to go. So are you coming or what?"  
"——而且我已经大学毕业了，但如果我得去，你也得去。所以你到底来不来？"

Shinji had stepped out of his room by this point, feeling the grunge of the past few days layer over him all at once. New smells filled his nostrils, no longer accustomed to the decay around him after so long away.  
此时，真嗣已经走出了自己的房间，过去几天的污秽感一下子全压在了他身上。新的气味充斥着他的鼻腔，长时间离开后，他已不再习惯周围的腐朽。

"Okay, I'll go." “好吧，我去。”

They talked over one another with long pauses here and there as they prepared for the day. He told her which sections she would need to study to start memorizing the correct characters, while she idled him with the past week of gossip at school. He'd never paid much attention to that and resorted to grunted responses, and she let it all spill out in a rush – until it built into an overflowing frustration. She turned it on him, because he was the easiest outlet, and he let her. He was far too tired to feel much of it.  
他们在准备一天的事务时，时不时地互相交谈，中间夹杂着长长的停顿。他告诉她需要学习哪些部分来开始记忆正确的字符，而她则用学校过去一周的八卦来打发他。他从未太关注这些，只是用咕哝声回应，而她则一股脑儿地把所有事情都倾吐出来——直到积累成一种溢出的挫败感。她把这股情绪发泄在他身上，因为他是最容易的出口，而他任由她这么做。他实在太累了，几乎感觉不到这些。

When they met at the corner stop on the way to school, Asuka greeted him by nagging at his state of dress, how ratty his shoes looked, and why he didn't at least comb his hair.  
当他们在去学校的路上在街角站相遇时，明日香以挑剔他的着装状态、他那破旧的鞋子以及为什么他至少不梳一下头发来向他打招呼。

"Is this how you treat people fresh out of the hospital?" he asked as she wrestled to clasp the top button of his shirt.  
“你就这样对待刚出院的人吗？”他问道，而她正努力扣上他衬衫的顶扣。

Asuka offered him a withering look. "No, just you."  
明日香给了他一个蔑视的眼神。“不，只是你。”

Cars squealed to a stop and the cross-walk chirped for them to move forward.  
汽车尖叫着停下，人行横道的提示音催促他们前行。

"Where's Zero?" Asuka asked, though didn't sound very curious.  
“零在哪儿？”明日香问道，语气中却并无太多好奇。

"Don't call her that." “别这么叫她。”

"You won't do anything if I do."  
"如果我做了，你也不会怎样。"

"I could stop talking to you."  
"我可以不再和你说话。"

"Then shut up already." "那就闭嘴吧。"

They parted at the shoe lockers and Shinji lamented the fact that he could have just stayed home after all. A few new bits of graffiti marred his locker, but there also seemed to have been an effort made at rubbing them away.  
他们在鞋柜处分别，真嗣感叹自己本可以干脆待在家里的。他的柜子上多了几处新的涂鸦，但似乎也有人试图擦掉它们。

Shoho and Kirishima both acknowledged him with a greeting as he entered the classroom, if not a half-hearted one. It stopped him in place for a minute, before he stammered out a greeting in return. Rei was not present. More and more he was beginning to think he had imagined her up until now. She was that specter she had been when they first met, hovering at the Commander's side. Falling in step behind Ritsuko as they embarked into the depths of Dogma - wherever that led.  
相田和桐生在他进入教室时都向他打了个招呼，虽然有些敷衍。这让他停顿了一下，然后结结巴巴地回了个招呼。绫波不在。他越来越觉得之前都是自己臆想出来的。她就像他们初次见面时那样，是司令身边的幽灵。跟在律子身后，踏入教条的深处——无论那会通向何方。

It was an uneasy thought. The idea of her not being so near.  
这个想法让他不安。她不再那么近在咫尺的想法。

Cicadas droned. The creeping exhaustion that had been pursuing him into the night finally caught up, and he slept through most of the lessons. All while Aida and Suzahara chucked bits of paper at him, seeing who could land a shot in his mouth.  
蝉鸣声不绝于耳。那种悄然逼近的疲惫感终于在夜晚追上了他，他大部分时间都在课堂上睡着了。与此同时，Aida 和 Suzahara 正向他扔纸团，看谁能扔进他的嘴里。

The whack of a ruler on wood snapped him upright, and peering down at him from slit eyes and enormous bifocals was Nebukawa.  
木尺敲击声将他惊醒，透过狭长的眼缝和巨大的双光眼镜俯视他的是 Nebukawa。

"Ever the enthusiastic academic, Mister Ikari," he said. The afternoon bells rang, saving him from further humiliation. The room began to disperse and someone stuffed a crumple of paper into his bag as they passed. Asuka. She was gone with the crowd and he filed out to the courtyards, streetside bustle echoing up to the school grounds.  
“一如既往地热衷于学术啊，Ikari 先生，”他说道。下午的铃声响起，使他免于进一步的羞辱。教室里的人开始散去，有人趁机将一团皱纸塞进他的书包，是 Asuka。她随着人群消失了，他则走出教室，来到庭院，街道的喧嚣声回荡在校园里。

Shinji caught sight of her by the western entrance, leaning against one of the walls. A smile splashed her face as she waved to a gaggle of passing girls, who returned the parting gesture with just as much enthusiasm. But only one party was faking it. She held her hand against her school bag.  
真嗣在西入口处看到了她，她靠在一堵墙上。她向一群路过的女孩挥手，脸上绽放出笑容，她们也热情地回应了她的告别。但只有一方是装出来的。她把手放在书包上。

As she began to walk, he read the note while trailing her at a non-invasive distance – which for Asuka measured about fifty feet.  
当她开始走动时，他在不侵扰的距离——对明日香来说大约五十英尺——跟随着她，同时读着那张纸条。

_I'm writing this staring at the back of your bloated head in class. You've been in quarantine for a week. A whole week. And I go out of my way to get your number from Misato, which was humiliating, not that you care. I call you and all you can say to me is 'what do you want?'  
我写这个的时候，正盯着你在课堂上的肿胀后脑勺。你已经隔离了一个星期。整整一个星期。我费尽周折从美里那里拿到你的号码，这很丢脸，不过你也不在乎。我给你打电话，你却只对我说‘你想要什么？’_

_Next time you see me don't talk to me.  
下次见到我，别跟我说话。_

Had she been upset about that the entire day?  
她一整天都在为此事心烦意乱吗？

A cross walk held her in place long enough for him to close the distance. Her right hand hung at her side, a bright red showing on her knuckles. Somewhere back at school there was a cinder-block wall marked with a smudge of blood. She _would_ do something like that. Asuka was just the kind of person to hurt herself if it meant keeping tears at bay. He reached out to inspect her hand, but she snatched it away.  
人行横道让她停留得足够久，让他得以缩短距离。她的右手垂在身侧，指关节处泛着鲜红。在学校某处的煤渣砖墙上，有一抹血迹。她会做出那种事。明日香就是那种人，为了不让眼泪流出来，宁愿伤害自己。他伸出手去检查她的手，但她迅速抽走了。

"Have you cleaned that?" "你清理过了吗？"

She ignored him, face hidden by her hair.  
她无视了他，脸被头发遮住。

"I have some gauze at home."  
"我家里有些纱布。"

Asuka whirled about-face, clamping his nose between thumb and index finger, and twisting until he shoved her hand away. They fumed, perhaps on the edge of something more violent.  
明日香猛地转身，用拇指和食指夹住他的鼻子，扭到她将他的手甩开。他们怒气冲冲，或许正处在更暴力的边缘。

She started off again and he caught up to walk at her side.  
她再次起步，他追上去与她并肩而行。

The trip back to his apartment was sharp with silence, clouded by a sour ache in his nerves. Upon arriving before the flat's door, all at once came the daunting realization that having Asuka over was an awful idea. The place was disgusting, which wasn't so bad when it was just him and Misato. Having others witness to his complacency made it all the more denigrating. His fingers nudged one another at his sides.  
返回他公寓的途中，沉默如刀，神经中弥漫着酸楚的痛感。站在公寓门前，他突然意识到邀请明日香来是个糟糕透顶的主意。这个地方脏乱不堪，平时只有他和美里倒也无所谓。但让别人看到他的懒散，更显得他自甘堕落。他双手在身侧不安地摩挲着。

"What are you waiting for?" Asuka was leaning against the wall alongside the door, crossed leg bouncing irately. Shinji punched in the access code and stepped inside. He flicked the lights on and greeted the place with a strangled, "I'm home."  
“你还在等什么？”明日香靠在门旁的墙上，交叉的腿不耐烦地弹跳着。真嗣输入了访问码，走了进去。他打开灯，用一种窒息的声音向这个地方打招呼：“我回来了。”

Stepping over a fallen trash bag from the pile along the hallway, he found PenPen's fridge occupied as usual. The bird's dwelling was nicer than most of the apartment. Misato took better care of the penguin than herself. His tea mug from that morning was sitting by the sink, half-empty. Dirty dishes piled the basins and the dishwasher was already full to bursting.  
他跨过一个倒在走廊旁的垃圾袋，发现 PenPen 的冰箱一如既往地被占满了。这只鸟的住处比公寓里的大多数地方都要好。美里对企鹅的照顾比对自己还要周到。他早上用过的茶杯还半满地放在水槽边。脏盘子堆满了水槽，洗碗机也已经满满当当。

Asuka shouldered past him and surveyed the living room. Revulsion crept ever further into her expression.  
明日香从他身边挤过，审视着客厅。厌恶之情在她脸上愈发明显。

"Want anything to drink?" he asked.  
"想喝点什么吗？" 他问道。

She considered where he stood in the kitchen, features quieting some as she shook her head and moved on to the sliding glass doors. "This place is a pig sty."  
她在他站立的厨房里思索着，随着摇头走向滑动玻璃门，神情稍显平静。"这个地方真是乱得像猪圈。"

"Yeah," he said, toying with something on the kitchen table to hide his inward flinch. Much like when he lived in Germany, her brooding scrutiny made him feel small, or unworthy.  
"是啊，" 他说着，摆弄着餐桌上的某样东西以掩饰内心的退缩。就像他住在德国时一样，她阴郁的审视让他感到渺小，或是不配。

Space was cleared off on the table by shoving some of the refuse to another corner, bits of it clattering to the floor. When she came back to the kitchen, he opened the first aid kit on the table and motioned for her to sit. She did so and allowed him to take her scuffed hand by the wrist. A yelp was bit down on her lower lip as he touched alcohol to it. She yanked her hand, and he yanked back, jabbing the cotton over the cuts. Her eyes pinched and her toes curled.  
他将桌上的杂物推到一角，腾出空间，一些零碎随之哗啦落地。她回到厨房时，他已在桌上打开急救箱，示意她坐下。她照做了，任由他握住她擦伤的手腕。当酒精触碰到伤口时，她咬紧下唇，发出一声闷哼。她猛地抽手，他也紧握不放，用棉球按压着伤口。她的眼睛紧闭，脚趾蜷缩。

When it was cleaned, he wrapped her hand with some gauze and administered bagged ice as was promised. Asuka was barely present for the affair, taking in every speck of detail. Shinji pinched her hand when he was done, which produced an annoyed scowl. It fell away without much else.  
清理完毕后，他用纱布包扎她的手，并如约递上冰袋。整个过程中，明日香几乎心不在焉，细致地观察着每一个细节。完事后，真嗣轻捏了一下她的手，换来她不满的皱眉。但这表情很快便消失了。

Asuka stood to inspect a mish-mash of old notes left on the fridge while he fished around his schoolbag under the table. "What kanji are you having trouble recognizing?"  
明日香起身检查贴在冰箱上的杂乱笔记，而他则在桌下翻找书包。“你在认哪些汉字上有困难？”

"There's a few hundred I haven't memorized yet. That and knowing when to use the hiragana and katakana right is… well, it's stupid." Utensils and other objects rattled about as she spoke, cupboards opening and smacking closed in rapid succession.  
"还有几百个我还没记住呢。还有就是知道什么时候用平假名和片假名对头……哎，真是蠢透了。" 她说话间，餐具和其他物品叮当作响，橱柜快速开合，砰砰作响。

He poked his head above the table, spying Asuka peering into a pantry cabinet. "What are you looking for?"  
他探出头来，看到明日香正盯着食品储藏柜。"你在找什么？"

"Trash bags. Do you even have any?"  
"垃圾袋。你这儿有吗？"

"Under the sink, on the left."  
“在水槽下面，左边。”

Asuka squatted in front of the sink, throwing the cabinets open and rifling through the contents. Setting aside several cleaning products as she went, at last she snatched a roll of white plastic and stood straight.  
明日香蹲在水槽前，猛地拉开橱柜，翻找着里面的东西。她一边整理出几样清洁用品，一边继续搜寻，最终抓起一卷白色塑料袋，站直了身子。

"What are you doing?" “你在做什么？”

She didn't answer him, taking a bag from the roll and ballooning it open. Starting on the counter next to the stove, she shoved empty beer cans, old rice cartons, and month-old newspapers within – pausing when she came across a stack of old lotto tickets.  
她没有回答他，从卷上扯下一个袋子，将其撑开。她从炉子旁边的台面开始，将空啤酒罐、旧饭盒和一个月前的报纸一股脑儿塞进去——当她发现一叠旧彩票时，停顿了一下。

"Keep, or trash?" "保留，还是丢弃？"

"Uh, trash?" They were all duds from the looks of it. Misato achieved little more than breaking even. When Asuka was done with that section, she took another bag and handed it to him so he could start on the table.  
"呃，丢弃吧？" 看起来都是些无用之物。美里最多也就是收支平衡。当明日香处理完那部分后，她又递给他一个袋子，让他开始清理桌子。

They cleared and itemized the kitchen over the next hour. She would hold an object up for his scrutiny, tilting it like the thumb of an emperor about to decide a gladiator's fate. He found several pairs of Misato's aviators as they ventured into the living room, which he put on and stared at Asuka with until she looked up. She tried and failed not to burst into giggles.  
接下来的一个小时里，他们清理并分类了厨房的物品。她会举起一件物品让他仔细检查，倾斜着它，就像一位皇帝即将决定角斗士的命运。当他们进入客厅时，他发现了美里的几副飞行员墨镜，戴上后盯着明日香，直到她抬头。她试图忍住不笑出声，但失败了。

"You are so lame, it hurts."  
"你真是太逊了，让人心疼。"

Shinji allowed himself a satisfied smirk.  
真嗣让自己露出一个满意的微笑。

After complaining that it was too quiet, Asuka searched the coffee table for the remote. That's where he'd last seen it, at least. In Misato's hands it changed locations every night. He heard her make a triumphant sound, slipping it free from a pile of old bill notices. She mashed a series of buttons in the general direction of the TV, twisting it at angles, then twisting herself.  
在抱怨房间太安静之后，明日香开始在咖啡桌上寻找遥控器。至少他记得上次看到它是在那里。在美里手里，它每晚都会变换位置。他听到她发出胜利的声音，从一堆旧账单通知中抽出遥控器。她朝着电视大致方向按了一串按钮，调整角度，然后自己也跟着扭动起来。

"How do you work this stupid thing?" She growled when all he did was laugh.  
“这破玩意儿怎么用啊？”她咆哮道，而他只是笑个不停。

"Advanced Japanese technology."  
“高级日本科技。”

The remote thwacked into his chest. It was far too funny to hurt much. She tossed her bag aside and refused to do any more cleaning until he turned the TV on. Snatching it from his hand, she flipped channels for a few minutes before settling on some movie about the riots way back when. It was loud and easy to tune out, at first. The longer it stayed on, the harder Shinji found it to keep his attention away. Hordes of students with bamboo pikes and white hardhats charged into a wall of shield police. Flags and banners waved amid the mass, fire belching over the shieldmen as rioters hurled molotovs from the roofs of cars. They answered with hoses mounted to water trucks.  
遥控器啪的一声砸在他胸口，这情景太滑稽了，以至于并不怎么疼。她把包扔到一边，拒绝再做任何打扫，直到他把电视打开。她从他手中夺过遥控器，随意切换了几个频道，最后停在一部关于很久以前骚乱的电影上。起初，这电影声音很大，很容易忽略。但随着时间推移，真嗣发现越来越难将注意力从屏幕上移开。成群的学生手持竹矛和白色安全帽，冲向盾牌警察组成的防线。旗帜和横幅在人群中挥舞，防暴警察头顶上火焰喷涌，骚乱者从车顶投掷莫洛托夫鸡尾酒。警察则用水枪还击。

He'd heard of something like this happening on the news the other day, somewhere in Tokyo-2. Asuka took notice and changed the station again, and he pretended not to be intensely annoyed. She bypassed several sports channels.  
前几天他在新闻上听说过类似的事情，发生在东京-2 的某个地方。明日香注意到了，再次换了频道，而他假装没有感到极度烦躁。她跳过了好几个体育频道。

"No football?" “不看足球吗？”

She shrugged. "I only watched it when you did. It's just a bunch of jocks kicking a ball around. How stupid is that?"  
她耸了耸肩。“只有你看的時候我才看。不就是一群运动员踢个球嘛。多蠢啊？”

"You're just mad because Dortmund keeps losing to Bayern."  
"你只是因为多特蒙德总是输给拜仁才生气的。"

Asuka smarted. He still remembered the game in 2011, and completely rubbing the defeat in her face. She'd knocked him in the groin for it and hadn't spoken to him for a week. Such was the price of victory.  
明日香感到一阵刺痛。他仍然记得 2011 年的那场比赛，完全把失败甩在她脸上。她为此踢了他的下体，并且整整一周没和他说话。这就是胜利的代价。

She gestured to their horde of trash bags. "If the apartment was this bad, I hate to imagine what your room looks like."  
她指着他们那一堆垃圾袋。"如果公寓都这么糟糕，我不敢想象你的房间会是什么样子。"

Shinji mustered some indignation at that. "It's actually pretty clean."  
对此，真嗣鼓起了一丝愤慨。“其实还挺干净的。”

"Which room is yours anyway?" She asked, having wandered over to the hallway. She already knew and, he suspected, had just been biding time for the opportunity to invade his personal space. Shinji hovered near and braced himself as she slid the door open and entered his domain.  
“反正你的房间是哪一间？”她问道，一边已经漫步到了走廊。她其实早已知晓，他猜想，只是在等待时机侵入他的私人空间。真嗣靠近门口，做好了准备，看着她滑开门，踏入了他的领地。

Beneath the window was an unmade bed, a sliver of fading purple-blue evening slipping in-between a gap in the drapes. Beside that was a nightstand that doubled as a work table, his schoolbag sitting on the floor next to it. Asuka stepped forward as though setting foot in ruins not touched in centuries, absorbing every detail. By the nightstand where his closet stood ajar, revealing a stack of drawers, were a set of yukata Misato had made him wear for festivals past. Along the walls stretched posters, also from Misato, of old American rock bands she had liked when she was his age. Then nearest the door sat a knee-height dresser where an unused TV collected dust along with other odds and ends.  
窗下是一张未整理的床，一抹渐淡的紫蓝色暮光透过窗帘缝隙溜了进来。旁边是一张兼具工作台功能的床头柜，书包就放在旁边的地板上。明日香向前迈步，仿佛踏入了数百年未曾触碰的废墟，细细观察每一个细节。在床头柜旁，衣橱半开着，露出了一叠抽屉，里面放着一套美里让他过去节日穿的浴衣。墙上贴着海报，也是美里给的，是她年轻时喜欢的美国老摇滚乐队。门口附近则是一个齐膝高的五斗橱，上面放着一台未使用的电视，积满了灰尘，还有其他零碎物品。

That was where Asuka stopped. "What are these?" she asked, leaning towards a pill bottle from his collection of empties.  
就在这里，Asuka 停下了。“这些是什么？”她问道，身体前倾，从他那一堆空瓶中拿起一个药瓶。

"Just some sleeping pills." He moved to stuff them in a drawer before she could get a good look. She snatched his wrist halfway through the action, ripping the bottle from his fingers with the other.  
“只是一些安眠药。”他试图在让她看清楚之前把它们塞进抽屉里。她在他动作进行到一半时抓住了他的手腕，另一只手从他手指间夺过了药瓶。

She glared at the label, then at him. "These aren't sleeping pills, stupid."  
她瞪着标签，又瞪向他。“这些不是安眠药，笨蛋。”

"I know." "我知道。"

"So don't lie." She tossed them in the drawer, shoving it closed.  
"所以别撒谎。" 她将它们扔进抽屉，用力推上。

"Sorry," he said. "对不起，" 他说。

Asuka went to rifling through some of the drawers and he sat on the floor, deciding this was going to take a while.  
明日香开始翻找一些抽屉，他则坐在地板上，心想这可能需要一段时间。

"What do you need them for?"  
"你要它们做什么？"

"Nightmares." "噩梦。"

"Mm. Me too." Whether to the nightmares or to the pills, she didn't elaborate. She seemed to be looking for something, standing straight and setting her hands on her hips. Her head quirked. "You collect mixtapes now?"  
"嗯，我也是。" 她没有明确说是对噩梦还是对药片，只是站得笔直，双手叉腰，似乎在寻找什么。她的头微微一偏。"你现在开始收集混音带了？"

At the far end of the table was a small city of cassette tapes. "Sort of. I know a kid from school whose dad owns a record shop. He's got a shopping cart in the back filled with old tapes he finds." The kid was Shoho and Shinji had not been by their shop since they stopped talking. Otherwise the collection might have grown twice the size.  
在桌子的尽头，是一座小小的磁带城市。“算是吧。我认识一个学校里的孩子，他爸爸开了一家唱片店。他在店后放了一辆购物车，里面装满了他在外面找到的旧磁带。”那个孩子是 Shoho，自从他们不再说话后，Shinji 就没再去过他们的店。否则这个收藏可能会翻倍。

"You're so weird," she said, undoing all of his organization to rifle through the labels. "What's with the American stuff?"  
“你真奇怪，”她说着，解开了他所有的整理，翻找着标签。“这些美国的东西是怎么回事？”

He crawled over and started picking the stacks apart. "I kind of like how it sounds sometimes."  
他爬过去，开始拆开那些堆叠。“我有时候挺喜欢那种声音的。”

She kneeled next to him. "Yeah, but you never used to listen to anything except for all of that Japanese pop."  
她跪在他旁边。“是啊，但你以前从来只听那些日本流行音乐。”

"I had a friend in Germany who liked American country. I guess English kind of grew on me."  
“我在德国有个朋友喜欢美国乡村音乐。我想英语就这样慢慢影响了我。”

"Who?" "谁？"

"You remember Swina?" He asked, and she answered with a blank look. "Scharnhorst?"  
“你还记得斯维娜吗？”他问，她则一脸茫然。“沙恩霍斯特号？”

"Ooh, yeah! What the hell, you were friends with him? Why?"  
"哦，是啊！怎么回事，你和他交过朋友？为什么？"

"For a little bit, and because we both started hanging out with Erika."  
"有一段时间，因为我们俩都开始和 Erika 一起玩。"

"Oh, _of course_." "哦，当然。"

Plastic clacked as they went through the pile, until Shinji found what he was looking for. "Here," he said, grabbing his SDAT and switching out the cassette. He popped in one ear bud and gave her the other. Electro dance and screeching guitar wailed in their ears.  
塑料发出咔嗒声，他们翻过一堆，直到真嗣找到了他要找的东西。“这里，”他说着，抓起他的 SDAT 并更换了磁带。他塞进一只耳塞，另一只递给她。电子舞曲和尖锐的吉他声在他们耳边响起。

"Xmal Deutschland?" Asuka asked, bobbing her head.  
“Xmal Deutschland？”明日香问，随着节奏点头。

"Yeah," he said, reading off the back. "Some Nena and Ton Steine, too."  
“嗯，”他说着，读着背面的标签。“还有 Nena 和 Ton Steine。”

They must have spent hours listening to tapes, shuffling from one to the next in a more rapid fashion than they deserved. A wellspring to parched thoughts. They voted on their favorites, which devolved into heated bouts of argument that died off as they stumbled upon something else they liked.  
他们一定花了好几个小时听磁带，从一个换到另一个，速度之快超出了它们应有的待遇。这就像是一股滋润干涸思想的清泉。他们投票选出最喜欢的，结果演变成了激烈的争论，但随着他们发现其他喜欢的曲目，争论又逐渐平息。

"This is your old one, right?" Asuka took the cassette where he'd left it on the dresser.  
“这是你那盘旧的，对吧？”明日香从梳妆台上拿起他留下的磁带。

"Yeah, I listen to it all the time, though."  
“嗯，我一直都在听。”

"Well, _I_ don't. It's the one with Miki, right?"  
“嗯，我不懂。是那个有美纪的，对吧？”

He nodded and clicked it in place. The SDAT began at the last track, 26. Once Again.  
他点点头，将其固定好。SDAT 从最后一轨开始播放，26.《再次》。

Asuka laughed and started to mime the words, and he was content to watch until her foot nudged his ankle, prompting him to join in. They sang together, but he couldn't keep tone. Asuka didn't care. He could forget a while about the Eva, the Angel from his nightmares, and the war over the mountains. They closed their eyes as their shoulders danced, letting the midnight city disappear.  
明日香笑着开始模仿歌词，他心满意足地看着，直到她的脚轻轻碰了碰他的脚踝，示意他加入。他们一起唱着，但他跟不上调子。明日香并不介意。他可以暂时忘却 EVA、他噩梦中的使徒，以及山间的战争。他们闭上眼睛，随着肩膀的舞动，让午夜的城市消失在视野之外。

### Chapter 4: Home Again
A hand dragged through her hair.  
一只手穿过她的头发。

Misato's head jerked from the crook of her elbow. She realized the hand was hers – numb from having been slept on. Pin-pricks trickled up her skin. Her lips smacked, tasting air again, and she checked the watch hanging from her other wrist. Another fitful three hours of sleep.  
美里猛地从肘弯中抬起头来。她意识到那只手是自己的——因长时间压着而麻木了。针刺般的感觉沿着皮肤蔓延。她咂了咂嘴，重新品尝到空气的味道，然后瞥了一眼另一只手腕上挂着的表。又是三个不安稳的小时过去了。

She yawned – stretched – feeling the tight bundles of tension in her neck, while an outstretched fist thwacked her computer monitor. Stifling a yelp, she shoved the thing, wishing it to fall from her desk and smash to pieces. It crashed atop her office phone instead, which clattered off the receiver and began to chirp.  
她打了个哈欠——伸了个懒腰——感受到颈部紧绷的肌肉，同时一只伸出的拳头敲在了电脑显示器上。她强忍住一声惊叫，用力推了推那东西，希望它能从桌上掉下去摔个粉碎。结果它却砸在了办公电话上，电话听筒被震落，开始发出刺耳的鸣叫。

Beneath it were a scattering of Shinji's daily logs by Section 2. Anything from his school commute to his sessions with Okinoshima. Every aspect of his life lay in front of her, waiting to be dissected and absorbed into relevant data.  
下面散落着真嗣第二部分的日常记录。从他上学通勤到与冲岛的会面，他生活的方方面面都摊在她面前，等待着被剖析并吸收进相关数据中。

The howling of the off-hook tone overwhelmed the place. It gave out a contented click when she set it back in the receiver. Her shoulders shook when the phone began to ring. Giving it a hard stare, she balanced on the cusp of not answering. With a sigh, she leaned forward and brought the piece to her ear.  
挂断的铃声在此处回荡。当她将电话放回听筒时，它发出了一声满意的咔嗒声。电话开始响时，她的肩膀颤抖着。她狠狠地盯着电话，几乎决定不接听。叹了口气，她向前倾身，将听筒贴近耳朵。

"Katsuragi," she said. “葛城，”她说。

"Fall asleep in your office again?" Ritsuko asked. Misato wanted to beat the smugness out of her voice.  
“又在你办公室睡着了？”律子问。美里真想把她的得意从声音里打掉。

"Hm, yeah – what's up?" Her hand dragged over her scalp and she recoiled at the feeling.  
"嗯，是啊——怎么了？" 她的手在头皮上拖过，随即因那感觉而退缩。

"Well, Director of Operations, my unit has been waiting on those personnel transfers from Section four and five for a week now. Are you planning on getting to those anytime soon?"  
"那么，作战部长，我的部队已经等了四区和五区的人员调动一周了。你打算近期处理这些事吗？"

Misato's eyes slipped in the direction of her IN-files, scattered and perhaps in varying degrees of completion.  
美里目光瞥向她散乱的内部文件，这些文件或许处于不同程度的完成状态。

"Isn't that Section six's job anyway?"  
"那不是第六科的工作吗？"

"You still need to sign off."  
"你还是需要签字确认。"

Fingers pressed into her forehead. "Why did you actually call?  
"手指按在额头上。“你到底为什么打电话来？”

"Grouchy, aren't we?" She said, as though Misato were being ungrateful. Another sigh tried to escape before she bit it back. Beneath her elbows stretched her desk. A desk far too long, the glaring white of the walls stinging amid its black surface.  
"脾气不小啊，不是吗？" 她说话的语气仿佛美里不知感恩。她强忍住又一声叹息。她的双肘下是她的办公桌。这张桌子长得过分，雪白的墙壁在黑色的桌面上显得格外刺眼。

"I wouldn't call over something so trivial as that," Ritsuko went on. "Work appears to be the only way to engage you now. I've had to resort to taking Kaji out as my drinking partner."  
"我可不会因为这种小事就生气，" 律子继续说道。"工作似乎是你现在唯一的兴趣了。我不得不找加持出去喝酒作伴。"

"I could care less who you drink with."  
"你跟谁喝酒我才不在乎呢。"

"Oh, I'm sure," she said and Misato gave more consideration to hanging up. "Drinking or no, I'm sure you realize you're neglecting your duties as Shinji's guardian."  
"哦，我确定，"她说道，Misato 更加考虑是否要挂断电话。"不管喝不喝酒，我相信你意识到你作为真嗣的监护人职责有所疏忽。"

"All of his records are up to date and he isn't starving."  
"他的所有记录都是最新的，他也没有挨饿。"

Ritsuko didn't seem to hear her. "What's the matter? Motherhood too difficult for you?"  
律子似乎没听到她的话。"怎么了？母性对你来说太难了吗？"

Heat rose in her chest. "Well, I haven't killed myself _yet_."  
热意在她胸中升腾。“好吧，我还没把自己弄死。”

Even as she spoke, she knew it was wrong. The silence over the line didn't make her feel any better and she was left to stew in her victory over a terse vacuum.  
尽管她这么说，她知道这是错的。电话那头的沉默并未让她感觉好些，反而让她在胜利的苦涩中独自煎熬。

"I suppose that makes Shinji rather lucky, all things considered," Ritsuko said.  
“考虑到所有情况，我想这倒是让真嗣相当幸运了。”律子说道。

Misato muttered an apology.  
美里咕哝着道歉。

"What will you do?" “你会怎么做？”

"I dunno, I..." several thoughts tagged to the end of that sentence, none of which she was brave enough to say out loud. A fake plant, some palm or another, sat in the left corner watching in mute apathy. The door to her office stood at attention next to it, and across from her a mirror that managed to encompass the whole room. Misato stared at herself, long hair matted and glossy with a new layer of grease, bitter wrinkles stretching from her eyes, the hollows beneath red and black.  
“我不知道，我……”几个念头接在那句话后面，但她没有勇气大声说出来。一盆假植物，或许是棕榈或其他什么，静静地坐在左角，冷漠地旁观。她办公室的门紧挨着它，严阵以待，而对面是一面镜子，巧妙地映照出整个房间。美里凝视着自己，长发纠结，泛着一层新的油光，眼角的皱纹苦涩地延伸，眼下的凹陷红黑交错。

She looked away. "It doesn't matter, I guess." Her throat ached for the warm tingle of liquor. The bottle of sake she kept in her left-hand drawer, the only piece of home she ever brought with her to this place, had been empty for some time. "He'll either buck up or he'll wash out."  
她移开了视线。“我想，这无关紧要。”她的喉咙渴望着酒的温暖刺痛。她左手抽屉里那瓶清酒，是她唯一带到这个地方的家当，已经空了很久。“他要么振作起来，要么就会被淘汰。”

The words didn't sound like hers. Chilled air hummed from the vents and she shivered. A red jacket lay draped over the backrest of her chair, though she made no move to grab it.  
这些话听起来不像她说的。冷风从通风口嗡嗡作响，她打了个寒颤。一件红色夹克搭在她的椅背上，但她没有去拿的意思。

"Hm. As simple as that is it?"  
“嗯。就这么简单吗？”

Ritsuko kept talking, but by then Misato had stopped listening – because a blue, unmarked thumb drive was sitting beside the barrel of her sidearm on the right corner of the table. One that had not been there when she fell asleep. A blister of color in her ordered, plain world.  
律子还在继续说着，但美里那时已经不再听了——因为一个蓝色、无标记的 U 盘正静静躺在她手枪旁边的桌角。这个 U 盘在她入睡时并不在那里。一抹突兀的色彩，打破了她井然有序、单调的世界。

She reached out, the surface smooth and making her fingers tingle. All about the room, there seemed to be eyes on her.  
她伸出手去，U 盘表面光滑，让她的手指感到一阵刺痛。整个房间里，仿佛有无数双眼睛在注视着她。

"Hey, can I swing by real quick?"  
“嘿，我能快速过来一下吗？”

---

"Lieutenant General Hanzo Toyotomi," Misato said, scrolling further through the dossier. Reading came in small doses, since it was all she could do to stay awake, even with the pleasant crawl of coffee from the mug in her other hand. That and the leather couch beneath her was proving far too inviting.  
“陆军中将半藏·丰臣，”美里说道，继续翻阅着档案。她只能小剂量地阅读，因为即便有手中咖啡杯里那令人愉悦的咖啡缓缓流入，她还是难以保持清醒。再加上身下的皮沙发实在是太过诱人。

"Commander of the..." Ritsuko leaned forward, squinting, "Northern Army?" She made a bemused face and hummed, withdrawing to her terminal. Opposed to Misato's office, the place was a home away from home. Notes, files, and reports were scattered between several terminals and a pair of printers while pictures, baubles and other adornments decorated the tops of monitors and CPUs. It looked like more of a home than Ritsuko's apartment, which she had visited on perhaps three or four occasions.  
“北方军……指挥官？”律子向前倾身，眯起眼睛，“北方军？”她露出一丝玩味的表情，哼了一声，回到自己的终端前。与美里的办公室不同，这个地方更像是一个远离家的家。笔记、文件和报告散布在几台终端和一对打印机之间，而照片、小饰品和其他装饰品则点缀在显示器和 CPU 的顶部。这里看起来比律子的公寓更像一个家，她可能只去过那里三到四次。

Misato shifted and blinked, straining her eyes to keep them from drooping. "It _was_ a pretty big air-raid to mobilize on such short notice," she mumbled.  
美里挪动了一下，眨了眨眼，努力不让眼睛闭上。“能在这么短的通知时间内动员起来，那次空袭规模肯定不小，”她喃喃自语道。

Ritsuko sighed through her nose, but played along, clacking away at some report or another. "So, how did he?"  
律子鼻子里叹了口气，但还是配合着，敲打着某份报告。“那么，他怎么样了？”

"He didn't," she said, jabbing her mug of coffee out. Scalding heat spilled over her fingers. "**Fuck**." Setting the mug down, she cursed some more while Ritsuko handed her napkins. Misato settled and picked up the laptop.  
“他没有，”她一边说，一边伸出咖啡杯。滚烫的热咖啡洒在她的手指上。“该死。”她放下杯子，又咒骂了几句，而律子递给她纸巾。美里平静下来，拿起笔记本电脑。

"You were saying?" “你刚才说什么？”

"He didn't mobilize it with his own strings. Toyotomi and General Yoshinari are old friends."  
"他并没有亲自操纵这一切。丰臣和吉成将军是老朋友了。"

The doctor watched her now, head propped up on a hand. "As I recall, he has about as much disdain for us as the Minister of Defense."  
医生此刻正看着她，一只手撑着头。“我记得，他对我们的轻蔑程度不亚于国防部长。”

"NERV is a UN paramilitary organization – foreign soldiers and financial backers with military autonomy on home soil doesn't sit well with home-brewed troops. It doesn't fit their doctrine."  
“NERV 是一个联合国准军事组织——外国士兵和拥有军事自治权的财务支持者在本土上并不受本土军队的欢迎。这不符合他们的教义。”

Ritsuko studied her a moment. "You have a hypothesis?"  
律子仔细打量了她一会儿。“你有一个假设吗？”

There was a coyness to her tone that told Misato her friend had already caught on to the vague line of thought she was stumbling through in her sleep deprived stupor. "Isn't it a little reckless to dump tens of thousands of gallons of chemicals banned by the Valentines Treaty? Stockpiles that _no one_ was supposed to know we still had? He'd have to be an idiot to ignore the political ramifications."  
她的语气中带着一丝狡黠，这让美里意识到她的朋友已经捕捉到了她在睡眠不足的恍惚中摸索的模糊思路。“倾倒数万加仑被情人节条约禁止的化学品，那些本不该有人知道我们仍有的库存，他得有多蠢才会无视政治影响。”

"He would have to be."  
“他确实得是。”

"Not reckless then. Intentional."  
"并非鲁莽，而是有意为之。"

Ritsuko sipped from her own mug. "You think so?"  
律子啜饮着自己的杯子。“你这么认为？”

"The Ministry of Defense released an official statement yesterday saying that the phosphorous was used in order to provide the Evangelions with a smoke screen. Anyone on the Security Council with half a brain knows that's absurd, but it's enough for them to try and claim they were acting in accordance with the Valentines Treaty." Misato took a large gulp of coffee, reveling in the sharp heat. "Still, some of it was within a civilian populated zone, even if it was evacuated."  
"国防部昨天发布了一份官方声明，称使用磷是为了给福音战士提供烟幕。安全理事会中任何一个有半点脑子的人都知道这很荒谬，但这足以让他们试图声称自己是按照瓦伦丁条约行事。" 美里大口喝着咖啡，享受着那股锐利的热度。"尽管如此，其中一部分还是在居民区使用的，尽管已经疏散。"

"The UN knows that too. They're mustering an official inquiry, from what I hear."  
联合国也知道这一点。据我所知，他们正在组织一次官方调查。

She shook her head. "That'll just make the JSSDF's gripes about foreign policing all the more legitimate – and the Prime Minister is just going to let it happen?"  
她摇了摇头。“那只会让自卫队对外国警察的抱怨更加站得住脚——首相就任由这事发生吗？”

Ritsuko spun around to her terminal, tantamount to a shrug. "He's no fan of the JSSDF upper echelons. I expect he thinks this public shaming will teach them a lesson."  
律子转身面向终端，这动作无异于耸肩。“他对自卫队高层没什么好感。我猜他认为这种公开羞辱能给他们一个教训。”

Would it? It couldn't be as simple as that. When it came to the military and their proxy wars, nothing ever was. Everything about this was a tidal wave, massive and overwhelming. There were too many threads to pick at, too many ideas that didn't make sense.  
会吗？事情不可能那么简单。涉及军队及其代理人战争时，从来就没有简单的事。这一切就像一场海啸，巨大而势不可挡。有太多线索需要梳理，太多想法说不通。

What was she looking at anyway? It couldn't be bigger than the Angels, not now. That was her priority. Everything else was just noise. It was a familiar sensation, one she had thought she left behind in Lichtenburg.  
她到底在看什么？总不会比天使们更重要，现在不是。那是她的首要任务。其他一切都只是噪音。这种感觉很熟悉，她以为自己在利希滕贝格就已经抛诸脑后了。

"What a waste of time," she said, just under her breath.  
“真是浪费时间，”她低声自语道。

"Why the sudden interest?"  
“为什么突然感兴趣了？”

"I don't know. It's just been bugging me."  
“我不知道。只是让我很烦。”

Really, it hadn't been more than a minor annoyance. The JSSDF made a spectacle of their inability to deal with the Angels every time one showed up. Her fingers brushed the blue thumb-drive. Hanzo's dossier was the only file on it. Whoever had given this to her had been thorough. Nothing on the security cams, and no activity reports from Section 2. If it was Ritsuko, then she wasn't telling.  
实际上，这不过是个小麻烦。每次使徒出现，日本自卫队都表现得无法应对，成了笑柄。她的手指轻触着蓝色的 U 盘。半藏的档案是上面唯一的文件。给她这个的人非常周到。监控摄像头上没有任何记录，第二科也没有活动报告。如果是律子，那她也没说。

"Hm."

"What?" "什么？"

"Have you seen him yet?"  
"你见到他了吗？"

A wall of emotions slammed into her.  
一股强烈的情感冲击着她。

"I haven't slept at home for a week."  
"我已经一个星期没在家睡觉了。"

"Afraid to go back, are we?"  
"害怕回去了，是吗？"

"Butt out." "别插手。"

The Doctor's lips quirked and she crossed her legs, removing her glasses to wipe the lenses. Her sharp features softened and became pensive. "Sympathy is something the human species craves. The child eagerly displays their injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults show their bruises. 'Self-pity' for misfortunes real or imaginary is a universal practice."  
博士的嘴角微微上扬，她交叉双腿，摘下眼镜擦拭镜片。她锐利的面容柔和下来，显得若有所思。 "同情是人类物种所渴望的东西。孩子急切地展示他们的伤口；甚至故意划伤或撞伤以获得丰富的同情。成年人同样展示他们的伤痕。对真实或想象的不幸感到'自怜'是一种普遍的行为。"

Misato stared into the laptop without seeing it, fingers frozen over the shallow keys as the clicks of her computers engulfed them.  
美里盯着笔记本电脑，却视而不见，手指僵在浅浅的键盘上，电脑的点击声将他们吞没。

"Some friend you are." “你这个朋友当得可真行。”

---

They were falling behind, and Asuka had to pause yet again, tapping her foot. When Shinji took notice, he started to walk slower. Zero matched his pace, but as with everything else, didn't appear to know why.  
他们落后了，明日香不得不再次停下脚步，轻敲着脚。当真嗣注意到时，他开始放慢脚步。零也配合他的步伐，但和其他事情一样，似乎并不明白为什么。

"Would you hurry up?!" "你能不能快点？！"

His head rolled with his eyes, but he picked up the pace. "Come on, Asuka, where are we going?"  
他随着眼神摇了摇头，但还是加快了脚步。“快点，明日香，我们要去哪儿？”

"I already told you – you have to wait! Geez, I don't even know why I brought you." She rounded the corner, looking for the sputtering red lights of a convenience store. The street became narrow, falling on an incline. A man on a bicycle wove down the opposite walk, but there was little to no traffic, and further on was the wall of concrete and fencing from her battle almost several weeks ago. They were in the right place.  
“我已经告诉你了——你得等！真是的，我都不知道为什么要带你来。”她拐过街角，寻找着闪烁的红灯，那是一家便利店的标志。街道变窄了，斜斜地向下延伸。一个骑自行车的人从对面的行人道上蜿蜒而下，但几乎没有车辆，再往前就是几周前她战斗过的那堵混凝土墙和围栏。他们来到了正确的地方。

"A one-hundred-yen store?" Shinji asked, catching her stare.  
"一百日元店？" 真嗣问道，捕捉到她的目光。

"No, dummy." She led them down, passing by the two men having their conversation about nothing while Tatsuro still sang over the speakers. She stepped over the warning labels on the street and into a tunnel lit in dim yellow, their footsteps echoing. Asuka glanced back to make sure they were following, finding Shinji eyeing the red markings spray painted beneath their feet.  
"不，傻瓜。" 她带着他们走下去，经过那两个男人正谈论着无关紧要的事情，而龙太郎仍在扬声器上唱歌。她跨过街道上的警告标志，走进一个昏黄灯光下的隧道，他们的脚步声在回响。明日香回头确认他们是否跟上了，发现真嗣正盯着他们脚下的红色喷漆标记。

"Are... we supposed to be down here?" He asked.  
"我们...应该在这里吗？" 他问道。

"Probably not," she said, reaching out to touch the wall and smirking. "Why, you scared?"  
“大概不会，”她伸手触摸墙壁，嘴角微扬，“怎么，你害怕了？”

He scoffed. 他嗤之以鼻。

As the path slanted into a trench, they turned left down an open maintenance way that Asuka couldn't recall walking through before. Cool cement, lit with a delicate glow, told her they were still in the right place. Pipelines guided them to a drainage joint, a massive hollow cylinder that radiated with far off light from somewhere above. Their shoes splashed through puddles as Asuka started at a run through the open maw of a tunnel. Expanding before them was the city's maze of flood corridors and their concrete forest. Sound became muted, save for the twittering of birds who'd taken roost from the drainage gaps above, which pooled beams of sunlight into the expanse. A low, hollow drone enclosed them, cold and in a way comforting as they descended steel stairs to the ground floor.  
随着道路倾斜进入一条沟壑，他们左转进入一条开阔的维修通道，这条路是明日香之前未曾走过的。冰冷的水泥地面，在柔和的光线下，让她确信他们仍在正确的位置。管道引导他们来到一个排水接头处，一个巨大的空心圆柱体，从上方某处散发着遥远的光芒。他们的鞋子溅起水花，明日香开始奔跑，穿过隧道敞开的入口。在他们面前展开的是城市迷宫般的洪水通道和它们的混凝土森林。声音变得沉闷，除了从上方排水缝隙中栖息的鸟儿发出的啁啾声，这些缝隙将阳光汇聚成束，照亮了这片广阔的空间。一阵低沉的嗡鸣声包围着他们，寒冷却又以某种方式带来安慰，他们沿着钢制楼梯下到地面层。

Shinji let out a gasp. "This is _awesome_."  
真嗣倒抽一口气。“这太棒了。”

Asuka turned to watch, hands knit behind her back. She let loose a howl, laughing when Shinji did the same. Their cries could have echoed for miles. It wasn't until they were dizzy from lack of air that they realized Rei had wandered off, the blue of her hair a pale speck in the orange light of the overheads.  
明日香转过身来观看，双手交叉在背后。她发出一声长啸，当真嗣也跟着这么做时，她笑了起来。他们的呼喊声本可以传到数英里之外。直到他们因缺氧而感到头晕目眩时，才意识到丽已经走开了，她蓝色的头发在头顶橙色灯光的映衬下显得苍白如点。

"Rei?" Shinji moved to follow as the girl pattered through shallow pools of water towards a beacon of sunlight, near the water way run-off. Asuka smiled. _Perfect_. She ran to catch up as Rei halted on the gangway leading outside.  
“丽？”真嗣移动着跟上去，女孩踩着浅水池向一束阳光走去，那里靠近水道排水口。明日香笑了。太好了。她跑去追赶，而丽在通往外面的舷梯上停了下来。

Corpse-rot choked the air, a bloated mass lying on the grated platforms. The wolfdog's fur had thinned as its skin swelled to bursting and turned red. Meaty holes where the eyes had popped gaped at nothing, home to skittering nests of flies that had begun to burrow and lay eggs.  
腐尸的恶臭窒息了空气，一具肿胀的尸体躺在格栅平台上。狼狗的毛发已稀疏，皮肤肿胀至极，泛着红，仿佛随时会爆裂。眼球爆裂处留下肉质空洞，成了忙碌的苍蝇筑巢产卵之地。

Asuka's face twisted and she tried to hide it by pinching her nose, while Shinji covered the lower half of his face with the rim of his shirt. Next to them, Rei looked unphased, though a hand had come up to her mouth. The rays from the sun were too hot, and Asuka was disgusted with how it felt, as if oozing over her bare skin. Her day felt wasted now because of that girl – not even a shriek.  
明日香的脸扭曲了，她试图通过捏住鼻子来掩饰，而真嗣则用衬衫边缘遮住了下半张脸。在他们旁边，绫波看起来毫不在意，尽管一只手已捂住了嘴。阳光过于炽热，明日香感到厌恶，仿佛那热浪黏腻地覆盖在她裸露的皮肤上。因为那个女孩，她觉得今天全然浪费了——连一声尖叫都没有。

"We should bury it," Shinji said, muffled through his shirt.  
“我们应该把它埋了。”真嗣透过衬衫含糊地说道。

"What? Ew, no – I'm not touching that thing!"  
"什么？呃，不——我才不要碰那东西！"

He was already bending, searching where best to grasp it from. "Rei, get the other end."  
他已经弯下腰，寻找最佳的抓握点。“丽，抓住另一头。”

The girl didn't move at first. Then she nodded, once and just so. She kneeled and tried to place her grip near the head, cupping the matted fur so that she had to touch it as little as possible. Flies buzzed around her head and she stilled, face scrunching.  
女孩起初没有动。然后她点点头，只一次，就那么一下。她跪下来，试图在头部附近找到一个抓握点，用手掌托住纠结的毛发，尽量减少接触。苍蝇在她头顶嗡嗡作响，她停了下来，脸皱成一团。

"Ugh, here, let me!" Asuka shoved Rei away and took one half of the corpse in her arms, shuddering as the rough flesh brushed against her. Clenching her teeth to stifle whimpers, they lifted on the count of three. Liquid spurted from the beast's jowls, spattering Rei's blouse with dark red bile. She jumped at the sudden impact, frozen in place as the thick substance dribbled down her shirt and over her skirt. She stared at it, arms held out as if by strings. Helpless.  
"呃，我来吧！" 明日香推开绫波，抱起尸体的一半，粗糙的肉体触感让她颤抖。她咬紧牙关压抑着呜咽，数到三时一起抬起。液体从怪物的嘴角喷出，溅在绫波的衬衫上，留下深红色的胆汁。她被突如其来的冲击吓了一跳，僵在原地，厚重的液体顺着衬衫流到裙子上。她盯着它，双臂像被线牵引着一样伸展开来，无助地站在那里。

Asuka stifled a giggle, biting down on it when Shinji glared back. They set the dog down, though she more or less dropped it, the sight of him fumbling with the thing soothing her some. The jerk.  
明日香忍住笑意，咬紧嘴唇不让笑声溢出，当真嗣瞪回来时。他们放下那只狗，虽然她几乎是扔下去的，看到他笨手笨脚地处理那东西，让她感到些许安慰。这个笨蛋。

"Well, now you've done it."  
"好吧，现在你搞砸了。"

He shot her another look and she had a mind to throw him over the gangway. "It's not my fault."  
他又瞥了她一眼，她真想把他从舷梯上扔下去。“这不是我的错。”

"You're the one who wanted to bury it, Stupid."  
“是你想把它埋起来的，笨蛋。”

"We shouldn't just leave it here."  
“我们不应该就这样把它留在这里。”

"Why not? It's dead anyway."  
“为什么不呢？反正它已经死了。”

Rei's arms settled, but otherwise she remained still, as though moving would make it worse. "I do not have a change of clothes."  
丽的双臂垂下，但除此之外她一动不动，仿佛移动会让情况变得更糟。“我没有换洗的衣服。”

The first and nearest shop was a men's clothing store – a small, stuffy outlet that appeared to have been a bar at some point. They decided it would be best if one of them went to get Zero clothes, but really it was Asuka that decided. So she grabbed several small shirts, at least small in men's sizes, and couldn't figure out what the hell to buy for pants. At least not until she found some denim overalls. It seemed a practical purchase if they were going to be playing with corpses in sewers all day, but mostly because she wanted to see the look on Zero's face when she was made to wear it. Asuka sped back to the underground overflow.  
第一家最近的店铺是一家男装店——一个狭小、闷热的店面，似乎曾经是一家酒吧。他们决定最好由其中一人去给零买衣服，但实际上是明日香决定的。于是她抓了几件小号衬衫，至少在男装尺寸里算是小号的，却怎么也想不出该买什么样的裤子。至少在她找到一些牛仔工装裤之前是这样。如果他们整天都要在下水道里和尸体打交道，这似乎是个实用的选择，但主要是因为她想看到零被迫穿上时的表情。明日香迅速返回地下溢流区。

"You could have picked _anything_ else," Shinji complained as he rifled through her purchase. Rei hadn't moved from her spot and the bile had dried a mustard yellow.  
"你本可以选择其他任何东西的，" 真嗣抱怨着翻看她的购物袋。绫波没有从原地移动，胆汁已经干成了芥末黄色。

"It was all they had," she said, shoving the bag into his hands, "and I didn't have to get anything – you're the one who should've gone since this was your idea. Take responsibility like a real man."  
"他们只有这些，" 她边说边把袋子塞到他手里，"而且我本不必买任何东西——既然这是你的主意，你才应该去。像个真正的男人一样承担责任。"

He shook his head. "Whatever."  
他摇了摇头。"随便吧。"

Shinji handed her the bag and Rei began to unclasp her blouse.  
真嗣递给她那个袋子，绫波开始解开她的衬衫扣子。

"Change over there where we can't see you!" Asuka shoved her in the direction they'd come. She leaned against the railing of the gangway, watching Zero move out of sight. Poisonous fantasies entered her mind. Her focus shifted to Shinji – fixed after the direction of Rei. "You're gross," she hissed, and shame reddened his cheeks, stare dipping to the concrete. She only felt a little sorry.  
“去那边换，别让我们看见！”明日香推着她往回走。她靠在舷梯的栏杆上，看着零消失在视线之外。有毒的幻想涌入她的脑海。她的注意力转向了真嗣——目光紧随着绫波的方向。“你真恶心，”她低声斥责，羞愧让他的脸颊泛红，目光垂向地面。她只感到一丝歉意。

The corpse stared off into the lake with its hollowed eyes.  
那具尸体空洞的眼睛凝视着湖面。

Rei looked uncomfortable when she returned, garbed in a white shirt that was too big and overalls, but didn't seem to care either way. Asuka folded her arms and delivered a smirk. Still nothing.  
丽回来时穿着一件过大的白衬衫和工装裤，看起来不太自在，但似乎也不怎么在意。明日香双臂交叉，露出了一丝得意的笑容。依然毫无进展。

"Where are we even going to take this thing?" She demanded.  
“我们到底要把这东西带到哪儿去？”她质问道。

Shinji squinted, pointing to the lakeside. "Down there."  
真嗣眯起眼睛，指向湖边。“往那边走。”

They went on a second time about burying the corpse. It had become a mission now, and even Zero seemed determined to follow through. They climbed their way down the concrete façade, some of it having collapsed due to neglect and careless construction.  
他们再次讨论起埋葬尸体的事宜。这已成为一项任务，甚至连零也似乎决心要完成它。他们沿着混凝土立面攀爬而下，部分结构因疏忽和粗心施工而坍塌。

Shinji and Rei hauled the body down while Asuka supervised, until they reached a small clearing on the shore of the lake. A pool of sweltering heat sat there, so humid their skin began to ooze with sweat. Nipa and pindo palms stretched along the edge of the water, while bundles of tall, thin trees battled for sun across the shore. Over the lake were the mountains, lit with glittering trams passing through the pines.  
真嗣和丽拖着尸体前行，而明日香在一旁监督，直到他们到达湖边的一小块空地。那里有一池热气腾腾的水，湿度之大让他们的皮肤开始渗出汗水。尼帕棕榈和频婆棕榈沿着水边伸展，而一簇簇高而细的树木在岸边争夺阳光。湖面上是群山，闪烁的电车穿梭在松林间。

They stripped one of the palms, the ends of the branches that hugged the trunk cupping to make somewhat of a shovel. None of them had ever buried a corpse before so couldn't have said where or how deep was right. They decided on a small clearing at the edge of the lakeshore where the earth was still sandy enough to dig in but at least thick enough that the bones wouldn't slip into the lake for a decade. Or so they guessed. Rei helped Shinji dig three feet with their makeshift shovel, aiming for six. It was back-aching work. Many broke, and she could see his arms trembling from the strain, though he didn't complain. He only stopped when a tenth snapped and cut splinters into his hand. She and Rei finished off the edges.  
他们剥下了一棵棕榈树的枝叶，将枝条末端紧贴树干弯曲成杯状，勉强做成了一把铲子。他们中没有人埋过尸体，所以无法确定正确的位置和深度。他们选择在湖岸边缘的一小块空地上，那里的土壤仍然足够松软可以挖掘，但至少足够厚实，骨头不会在十年内滑入湖中。或者他们是这么猜测的。丽帮助真嗣用他们自制的铲子挖了三英尺，目标是六英尺。这是一项令人腰酸背痛的工作。许多枝条断裂了，她能看到他的手臂因用力而颤抖，尽管他没有抱怨。他只是在第十根枝条断裂并刺入他的手时才停下来。她和丽完成了边缘的修整。

Deciding four feet was deep enough, they took a break while Shinji plucked shards of wood from his hand. Asuka sat next to him, pinching some of the deeper bits free when she thought he was being too cautious about it. Rei was on the other side of the grave, her legs dangling in.  
决定四英尺深度已经足够，他们休息了一下，真嗣从手中拔出木屑。明日香坐在他旁边，当他过于谨慎时，她会帮他拔出一些更深的碎片。丽则坐在坟墓的另一边，双腿悬空。

When the smell of the corpse began to drift back to them, they each took a limb in hand and dragged it across the sand. Shinji hauled it in the rest of the way, just about tumbling in himself.  
当尸体的气味开始飘回他们身边时，他们各自握住一肢，拖过沙地。真嗣将其余部分拖了进来，差点自己也摔倒。

Their shovels broken, they each set to pushing and tossing handfuls of sand to fill the grave. Stains smeared the seams of their skin and caked their fingernails with grit. Asuka brushed off what was left on her jean shorts and Shinji rinsed his hands in the lake, fetching a small twig with which to scrape the dirt from his nails.  
铁锹已坏，他们各自开始用手推抛沙子填埋坟墓。污渍沾满了他们的皮肤缝隙，指甲里塞满了沙粒。明日香拍掉牛仔裤短裤上残留的沙子，而真嗣则在湖中洗手，捡起一根小树枝刮掉指甲里的泥土。

"Why are you even bothering? Your hands are still going to get dirty. We have to find something to use as a grave marker now."  
“你何必费这个劲？手还是会弄脏的。我们现在得找个东西做墓碑。”

Shinji turned to consider the burial, his expression sinking. He tossed his stick into the lake and stood. "Okay, well, what can we use?"  
真嗣转身看着坟墓，表情变得沉重。他扔掉树枝，站起身来。“好吧，那我们能用什么？”

Asuka rolled her eyes and pushed to her feet. Approaching the nearest tree, she snagged one of the dry, rough vines trying to cord its way around the trunk. She tugged, ripping its snaring fingers free.  
明日香翻了个白眼，挣扎着站起身来。她走向最近的一棵树，抓住一根试图缠绕树干的干枯粗糙藤蔓。她用力一拉，将那些缠绕的藤条扯断。

"Zero-" the word caught in her throat when Shinji's face flattened. She boiled. "_Rei_. Pull on this."  
“零——”这个词卡在了她的喉咙里，因为真嗣的脸色变得苍白。她怒火中烧。“绫波，拉住这个。”

The girl tugged, standing when she realized she'd need more leverage. She planted her feet and gave it several sharp tugs before something snapped and she tumbled to her rump. The vine fell with its bundle of dry-rot branches. Shinji and her huddled near and watched as Asuka took two pieces to make a cross and knotted them together with the vine.  
女孩用力拉扯，意识到需要更多杠杆作用后站稳了脚跟。她连续猛拉了几下，直到某处断裂，她一屁股摔倒在地。藤蔓连同它捆绑的枯枝一起掉落。真嗣和她凑近了看，只见明日香拿起两段藤蔓交叉成十字形，然后用藤条将它们紧紧绑在一起。

"There," she said, shoving it into the sand, "that should do it."  
"好了，" 她说着，将它塞进沙子里，"这样应该就行了。"

"How'd you even find this place?"  
"你是怎么找到这个地方的？"

"After my first battle. I was wandering around the city because I was mad at you."  
"在我第一次战斗之后。我因为生你的气，就在城里四处游荡。"

Shinji grunted, his interest waning. She watched him shrink into himself as he squatted near the grave. Grimacing, she sat too, and Rei remained where she had fallen pulling the vines.  
真嗣咕哝了一声，兴趣渐失。她看着他蹲在墓旁，整个人缩成一团。她皱着眉头也坐了下来，而丽依旧躺在原地，拉着藤蔓。

"Should we say something?" Asuka asked, so soft she hoped no one had heard.  
“我们该说点什么吗？”明日香轻声问道，希望没人听见。

Shinji looked up. "For a dog?"  
真嗣抬起头。“为了只狗？”

She felt the muscles in her face run taut and he flinched. Her heart could have been beating a thousand miles a minute, hammering away in her chest while she stared. Shinji's shoulders fell, his eyes offering understanding as he stood. She only hated him a little less. A drowsy wind passed, upsetting her hair and rattling the trees.  
她感到脸上的肌肉紧绷，他则畏缩了一下。她的心跳可能已经达到了每分钟一千次，在胸腔里猛烈跳动，而她只是凝视着。真嗣的肩膀垂下，他的眼神透露出理解，站在那里。她对他的恨意只是稍稍减轻了一些。一阵困倦的风吹过，扰乱了她的头发，摇动了树木。

"What was it Luitpold used to say?" he asked.  
“路易波尔德以前常说些什么？”他问道。

Asuka didn't answer. 明日香没有回答。

Knitting his hands together, he closed his eyes and bowed his head. Asuka shifted to her knees and did the same. His brow became knit with concentration and he spoke slow as each word was pulled from memory. "Thy punishment he shall... endure?" he repeated the word in German several times, then nodded. "Endure, by coming in the... _flesh_, to... to a reproachful life and a cursed death... announcing? Uh, _proclaiming_, life to all who... who... _who shall_ believe in his redemption."  
他双手交握，闭上眼睛，低下头。明日香跪下，同样如此。他的眉头因专注而紧皱，说话缓慢，仿佛每个词都从记忆中抽出。“他将承受你的惩罚……？”他多次用德语重复这个词，然后点头。“承受，通过以肉身降临……降临到一个受谴责的生活和被诅咒的死亡中……宣告？呃，宣扬，生命给所有……所有……所有相信他救赎的人。”

Shinji blew out a sigh. "Amen," he said after a long breath, and Asuka mouthed the same, easing back before he noticed she'd moved at all.  
真嗣叹了口气。“阿门，”他长长地呼出一口气后说道，明日香也默念同样的话，轻轻后退，直到他注意到她动了。

"What is that for?" Rei asked, and Shinji shrugged.  
“那是干什么用的？”丽问道，真嗣耸了耸肩。

"It's just something you say for dead people. Or dogs, I guess."  
“只是对死去的人或狗说的话罢了。”

Asuka used the tip of her shoe to flick dirt in his direction. The rest of her leg kicked out, heel disturbing the dirt of the fresh grave. Shinji sat on the haunches of his feet, making a meek attempt at tossing the dirt back. It never reached her. Her heel pushed at the earth a few more times, making a neat row of shallow trenches.  
明日香用鞋尖朝他的方向弹了些泥土。她的腿随后踢出，鞋跟搅动了新坟上的土。真嗣蹲坐着，试图将泥土抛回去，但总是够不到她。她的鞋跟又推了几下泥土，留下一排整齐的浅沟。

She shifted and her hands moved next, palming more piles to the center. Shinji borrowed mounds of it from his end, while Rei watched – until she found a suitably fat stick to bulldoze the soil into position with. As her and Shinji began to give the mound shape, the girl couldn't resist touching the cool, gritty earth with her hands any longer, retrieving the stick again only to flatten the sides evenly.  
她挪了挪位置，双手接着动了起来，将更多的土堆推向中央。真嗣从他那边借来一堆堆的土，而丽则在一旁观看——直到她找到一根足够粗的树枝，用来将土壤推到合适的位置。随着她和真嗣开始给土堆塑形，女孩再也忍不住用手去触摸那冰冷、粗糙的泥土，再次拿起树枝只是为了将两侧平整均匀。

When it was done, the three of them stood around it for what could have been a year too long, until Shinji quietly prodded them to leave. Asuka allowed him this – keeping her place at the head of the pack through the concrete forest, a small pyramid left atop the wolfdog's grave.  
完成后，他们三人围着它站了许久，仿佛过了一年之久，直到真嗣轻声催促他们离开。明日香默许了他的提议——在混凝土森林中保持领头的位置，留下一个小小的金字塔立在狼狗的坟墓上。

---

School was perhaps the one place he had no cell service. Even in the GeoFront there was a hub to connect with, and often less polluted than anything in Tokyo-3 proper. Yet here, of all places, outgoing messages failed to send and he rarely received any until he left the grounds, too late.  
学校或许是唯一一个他没有手机信号的地方。即使在 GeoFront 也有连接的枢纽，而且通常比东京 3 号本地的任何地方都要少受污染。然而在这里，偏偏是这个地方，发出的信息总是发送失败，而他也很少收到任何消息，直到离开校园，为时已晚。

Not that Shinji had a great many people to talk to. Not like most of the other students, with their sleek top of the line phones and unlimited data plans.  
并非说真嗣有很多可以交谈的人。不像其他大多数学生，他们拥有最新款的手机和无限流量的套餐。

Out of the handful of numbers he possessed – Misato, some of the bridge crew, Rei, Ritsuko, even one of the pit mechanics, his Section 2 handler, and now Asuka – out of them all only one was missing a name. A series of random numbers – making his father akin to some unsolvable equation.  
在他所拥有的寥寥几个号码中——美里、一些指挥室成员、绫波、律子，甚至还有一位维修区的技师，他的第二支部联络人，以及现在的明日香——所有这些号码中，只有一个没有名字。一串随机的数字——使他的父亲如同一个无法解开的方程式。

He stared at it some mornings, the school moving around him. It would be easy to hit the call button, but there was no telling if the connection would make it through. Besides, a mere pilot calling the Commander of NERV seemed impudent to him. Even if that Commander was supposed to be his father.  
有些早晨，他会盯着这个号码，周围学校的活动在他身边进行。按下通话键很容易，但无法确定是否能接通。此外，仅仅作为一名驾驶员给 NERV 的指挥官打电话，对他来说似乎有些冒失。即使那位指挥官本应是他的父亲。

Shinji made his mandatory visits to Okinoshima's office, talking about his childhood friend between her questions, along with whatever else came to mind. She did not appear the least bit interested nor gave any indication she was listening, sometimes cutting him off when they were done and it was time for him to go.  
真嗣定期去冲岛的办公室报到，在她的提问间隙谈论他的青梅竹马，以及其他任何浮现在脑海中的事情。她似乎一点也不感兴趣，也没有表现出在听的样子，有时在他们结束谈话，他该离开时还会打断他。

On some of those days Rei would find him, as she had a way of doing, and they would wander down to one of the food courts in Central. If Asuka happened to hound their location via text, she would prop herself between them and fill the space with talk of her Eva and the futility of testing someone already so superior.  
有些日子里，丽会找到他，就像她总有办法做到的那样，他们会一起漫步到中央区的一个美食广场。如果明日香碰巧通过短信追问他们的位置，她会挤在他们中间，用她对 EVA 的谈论以及对已经如此优秀的人进行测试的无意义来填满空间。

When at school, Shinji occupied one of the desks beside Asuka's so they could work on her Kanji between lessons. Many of the seats were empty anyway since so many students had moved after the battles. Their studying sessions devolved into a discussion of music, the city, sometimes their Evas, and TV shows Asuka kept up with religiously. They spoke in German, not even realizing they'd made the switch until classmates began to direct glares their way.  
在学校时，真嗣坐在明日香旁边的座位上，他们可以在课间一起练习汉字。由于许多学生在战斗后搬走了，许多座位都是空的。他们的学习时间逐渐变成了对音乐、城市、有时是他们的 EVA，以及明日香虔诚追随的电视节目的讨论。他们用德语交谈，甚至没有意识到自己已经切换了语言，直到同学们开始向他们投来不满的目光。

"It was your fault," she'd whisper, still in her native tongue out of spite.  
"这是你的错," 她会低声说，仍然用她的母语，出于怨恨。

"You wouldn't switch so much if your Japanese didn't sound like a gagging fox."  
"如果你说的日语不像一只噎住的狐狸，你就不会换得那么频繁。"

"You're one to talk. At least mine doesn't sound like word-vomit."  
"你倒是说说看。至少我的不像一团乱吐的词。"

And so it went, the jibes turning into insults that wounded the other to make them inconsolable for a time, forgotten like a dream when they were drawn together again. An excuse invented here; a lie told there. They both knew the game. All the while Shinji was wrapped in the dark reaches of his last sortie. They grabbed him while he sat on the roof staring at clouds, in the night when his bed became an oven, or lurking in the deep waters of the Testing Chambers.  
事情就这样发展着，嘲讽变成了伤人的侮辱，让对方一时无法释怀，却又像梦境般被再次吸引时遗忘。这里找了个借口；那里撒了个谎。他们都心知肚明这场游戏。与此同时，真嗣沉浸在他最后一次出击的黑暗深处。他们在他坐在屋顶凝视云朵时抓住他，在夜晚他的床变成火炉时，或在测试室深水区潜伏时。

Misato started sleeping at home again, her array of shoes sitting by the front door, keys hanging and clusters of empty beer cans growing across surfaces. They never stayed for long, ending up in the trash one way or another.  
美里又开始回家睡觉了，她那一排鞋子放在前门旁，钥匙挂着，空啤酒罐在各处堆积成簇。它们不会停留太久，最终以某种方式进了垃圾桶。

He woke before the sun rose, when she would still be sleeping, and waited under the yellow hum of a bus stop as deep blue night turned to pale morning and the cricket chirps faded. In the evenings, he arrived home as the cicadas wailed and a dark wash came to take the sky back. Misato would either already be at one of her night shifts, or would have retired to the small comforts of her room, not to emerge 'till morning. Shinji would go to bed with a meal of sliced cucumbers and peanut butter, jamming a stick between his door and the wall to keep it locked whenever he caught sounds of her in the apartment.  
他在太阳升起之前醒来，那时她还在睡梦中，他站在公交车站下，听着黄色的嗡嗡声，深蓝色的夜色渐渐转为苍白的清晨，蟋蟀的鸣叫声逐渐消失。傍晚时分，他回到家，蝉鸣声此起彼伏，夜幕降临，天空被黑暗笼罩。美里要么已经在她的夜班上，要么已经回到她房间的小小舒适中，直到早晨才出来。真嗣会吃着黄瓜片和花生酱上床睡觉，每当他听到她在公寓里的声音时，就会在门和墙之间塞一根棍子，以防门被打开。

Sometimes the slap of a fridge roller, or the wood of her door frame, or padding footsteps on carpet. At times he fell asleep next to the door, revisiting the desiccated ruins of his garden home – the great wolf's shadow lurking outside.  
有时是冰箱滚轮的拍打声，或是她门框的木头声，或是地毯上的脚步声。有时他会在门旁睡着，重游他那干涸的花园家园的废墟——巨狼的影子潜伏在外。

Rei's life was not an unpleasant one.  
绫波的生活并不令人不快。

It was not a thing she could compare or measure, but more of a sense. Something passed along in her time with Shinji, the boy who was a pilot like her. A feeling of pressure she could not place, not unlike sitting in her Eva while it hummed at her presence.  
这不是她能比较或衡量的东西，而是一种感觉。在她与真嗣——那个和她一样的驾驶员——相处的时光中，有一种难以名状的压力。这种感觉就像坐在她的 Eva 里，机器因她的存在而低鸣。

The train blared as it set off again, a rush of hot air billowing with its departure. Few others disembarked to the streets below, scuffing down narrow stairs into the urban sprawl of Tokyo-3, where the houses were packed tight and the electric wires that kept the life blood of the city flowing crisscrossed so dense in places, it was hard to make out any sky. Plants overflowed from balcony gardens and cherry trees lined some of the crooked paths.  
火车鸣笛再次启动，伴随着出发的热风扑面而来。少数人下车走向下面的街道，沿着狭窄的楼梯进入东京-3 的都市蔓延区，那里房屋密集，城市的生命线——电线纵横交错，以至于在某些地方几乎看不到天空。阳台花园中的植物溢出，一些曲折的小径旁排列着樱花树。

Even from here, Rei could make out the cluster of Tokyo-3's towers, specks of black that must've been birds barely visible against their pale faces. They looked as though they did not belong in the caldera.  
即使从这里，丽也能看到东京-3 塔楼的群集，黑色的小点可能是鸟儿，在它们苍白的表面上几乎看不见。它们看起来似乎不属于这个火山口。

It crept upon her, again that feeling that emanated deep from the plug-depth and followed her to her apartment, resting there in the shadows and moonlight. She didn't have a name for it, only that it had been a looming companion all her life, driven away only in the presence of the Commander.  
那种感觉再次悄无声息地袭来，从深处涌出，一路跟随她回到公寓，在阴影与月光中潜伏。她无法给它命名，只知道它一生都是她如影随形的伴侣，只有在指挥官在场时才会暂时消失。

Without intention, Rei came to one of the ramen shops they frequented, entertaining that Shinji might appear even though she had nothing to suggest he would. Onion broth and garlic swelled in her lungs, the warmth of the noodles soothing even amid the stagnant heat that wet her skin.  
无意识间，丽来到了他们常去的那家拉面店，尽管没有任何迹象表明他会来，但她心中仍抱着一丝他会出现的幻想。洋葱汤和蒜香在她的肺中弥漫，面条的温暖在潮湿闷热中抚慰着她湿润的皮肤。

From her school bag she pulled a book, the edges rough and the spines creased. It was the only gift she had ever received from another person, at least for a birthday, which no one else within her small sphere of connection seemed to celebrate. She owned many more books now, bought from a bookshop buried deep in the overlooked bustle of Tokyo-3. A private place that the snakes were fond of, watching her depart with musty tomes from their thin, spiraling tree at the entrance.  
她从书包里拿出一本书，边缘粗糙，书脊皱褶。这是她唯一从别人那里收到的生日礼物，至少在她那狭小的人际圈里，似乎没有人庆祝这个。现在她拥有更多书籍了，都是从东京-3 一处被忽视的喧嚣中的书店购得。那是一个隐秘之地，那些蛇喜欢的地方，它们在入口处细长的螺旋树旁，目送她带着发霉的书籍离开。

She missed the smell of it and the slow, predictable movements of the shopkeep. Her fingers brushed the coarse paper as she opened to a random page. She tried to read but could not understand a word of it. The world seemed to be pulsating around her. Her mind wandered to the bloated wolfdog and the tomb they'd made for it. A pyramid of sand. She could still feel the scraping grit between her fingers.  
她怀念那股气味，以及店主缓慢而有规律的动作。她的手指拂过粗糙的纸张，随机翻开一页。她试图阅读，却一个字也看不懂。周围的世界似乎在她的眼前脉动。她的思绪飘向了那只肿胀的狼狗，以及他们为它堆砌的坟墓——一座沙堆成的金字塔。她仍能感受到指间沙粒的摩擦。

Rei wiped her hands on her skirt.  
丽擦了擦手，裙子上留下了痕迹。

Other customers arrived and placed their orders. She made an effort for several more minutes to understand the book in her hands, but gave it up and left her bowl half-eaten. The smell of burning meats had begun to dredge at her stomach.  
其他顾客陆续到来，下单点餐。她又努力了几分钟试图理解手中的书，但最终放弃了，留下半碗未吃完的食物。烤肉的焦香开始勾起她胃里的不适。

The day was falling to sunset, enclosed by roaring traffic punctuated with the laughter of crows. A mother and child passed over the train tracks on their bikes, wheels clicking. Rei followed the road they'd come down, a long rack lined with white bikes greeting her beneath a cherry tree.  
夕阳西下，喧嚣的车流中夹杂着乌鸦的笑声。一位母亲和她的孩子在自行车上越过铁轨，车轮发出咔嗒声。丽沿着他们来的路走去，一排白色自行车在樱花树下整齐排列，迎接她的到来。

Rei paid the fee and stood there with it, a trembling in her gut.  
丽付了费用，手里拿着票据，心中忐忑不安。

She spent several minutes struggling for balance, and with every moment she achieved it, the bike swayed and taught her again she hadn't. It was impossible to simply sit on the thing and balance. She would have to move forward.  
她花了好几分钟努力保持平衡，每找到一次平衡，自行车就摇晃起来，再次告诉她其实并没有掌握。光是坐在上面保持平衡是不可能的。她必须向前移动。

Rei pushed off, arms taut with the pressure of keeping the front wheel straight. Her arms twitched with micro-movements. The bike lurched.  
丽推开自行车，双臂因保持前轮笔直而紧绷。她的手臂微颤，自行车猛地一晃。

One side of her smashed into a tree – hard. Then there was the concrete, rough, and spinning. Pain came in swelling tidal waves, pinpointing each scrape and cut and seeping bruise. Rei pushed on the ground, her wrist protesting. Streaks of red spilled over her arms, a hand hovering over her mouth as her stomach lurched.  
她的一侧狠狠撞上了一棵树——很重。接着是粗糙的水泥地，旋转着。疼痛如潮水般涌来，精确地定位每一处擦伤、割伤和淤青。丽用手撑地，手腕抗议着。血迹沿着她的手臂流淌，一只手悬在嘴边，她的胃一阵翻腾。

There were few people about for the time of day, and those that were passed her with a curious glance or two. Save for a pair she recognized, shadows that had become more vivid in the last year.  
这个时间段行人稀少，偶尔有人经过，投来一两个好奇的目光。除了她认出的那对身影，在过去一年里变得更加鲜明的影子。

Suzahara stopped across the street, arming his companion Aida and pointing in her direction. Embarrassed, he looked around, snarled something at Aida, who locked eyes with her before averting them. Suzahara stared and raised a hand to wave, his arm unsure. They crossed the street after a handful of cars.  
铃原在街对面停下，示意同伴相田注意那边。他尴尬地环顾四周，对相田低声咆哮了几句，相田则在与她对视后移开了目光。铃原凝视着她，犹豫地举起手挥了挥，手臂显得有些迟疑。他们在一阵车流后穿过了街道。

"Hey, you okay Ayanami?" “嘿，绫波，你还好吗？”

Rei blinked. "Yes," she said, managing to get herself up from the ground, though her legs were still trapped with the bike.  
绫波眨了眨眼。“是的，”她说着，努力从地上站起来，尽管她的腿还被自行车压着。

Aida flinched. "Uh, you're bleeding."  
Aida 退缩了一下。“呃，你在流血。”

"I am used to pain," Rei said, wincing as she slipped her aching legs free. A lie. She was never used to pain. It was always new and raw and torturous. Becoming used to something was not the same as expecting it. She had said it because it seemed like something she was supposed to say.  
“我习惯了疼痛，”Rei 说着，一边皱眉将酸痛的双腿抽出。这是谎言。她从未习惯疼痛。疼痛总是新鲜、生硬且折磨人。习惯某事并不等同于预期它。她之所以这么说，是因为这似乎是她应该说的。

They moved as if to help, though the action faltered, Aida going as far as to reach for her before pulling back. Rei stood, bleeding, elbows and half her face smeared with sidewalk grit.  
他们似乎想帮忙，但动作犹豫不决，Aida 甚至伸出手去，却又缩了回来。Rei 站立着，流着血，手肘和半边脸都沾满了人行道的尘土。

"Should we call somebody?" Suzahara asked.  
"我们应该叫人来吗？" 铃原问道。

With slow, painful intention, she picked up the bike to march it back to the rental rack. "I am fine."  
她缓慢而痛苦地扶起自行车，准备将其推回租赁架。"我没事。"

"You sure?" Aida called, the two boys standing as if frozen in place. A limp accompanied her right leg.  
"你确定吗？" 相田喊道，两个男孩仿佛僵在原地。她的右腿一瘸一拐。

Through the vending machines, parking meters and trees, the rental rack was a speck of color. She had traveled farther than she thought. The chain clicked, followed by the scuff of heels behind her, birds whistling over her head. Cars hummed by, children trying to catch the ever-buzzing cicada bugs. The bike rack was far.  
穿过自动售货机、停车计时器和树木，租赁架只是斑斓中的一抹微光。她走得比自己想象的还要远。链条咔嗒作响，随后是高跟鞋的拖沓声，鸟儿在头顶上空鸣叫。汽车嗡嗡驶过，孩子们试图捕捉那些总是嗡嗡作响的蝉虫。自行车架还很远。

"Was that your first time riding a bike?"  
“那是你第一次骑自行车吗？”

"Yes." "是的。"

Their silence made her feel lost.  
他们的沉默让她感到迷茫。

"You think it strange." "你觉得这很奇怪。"

Aida shrugged. "A little. We won't tell anybody, though."  
艾达耸了耸肩。"有点。不过我们不会告诉任何人。"

Once the bike was returned, Rei saw that Aida had abandoned them. Yet he emerged from the door of a steam cleaning service nearby, handing her a soaked rag.  
自行车归还后，丽发现艾达已经离开了。然而他从附近一家蒸汽清洗服务的门口走出来，递给她一块湿漉漉的抹布。

When she took it without comment, he motioned to one of her cuts. "So they don't get infected."  
她默默接过，他便指向她的一处伤口。“这样就不会感染了。”

Rei took in the wounds, where the skin had been sheared off more than cut. Her stomach rolled again, so she sat. Damp and warm, she swiped the cloth over her scrapes, flinching at the sharp bite of contact. The boys shifted and averted their eyes, as though this were something private. Perhaps it was and she was acting out of etiquette, as Shinji often did.  
丽审视着那些伤口，皮肤被撕扯得比切割更甚。她的胃再次翻腾，于是坐了下来。湿润而温暖，她用布擦拭着擦伤，因接触的刺痛而抽搐。男孩们挪动身体，避开视线，仿佛这是件私密的事。或许确实如此，而她正像真嗣常做的那样，逾越了礼节。

That was it, the tug she felt in her shoulders, something unfamiliar. In her year of knowing these faces, always she had been with Shinji when they walked to and from school. Never had she been in their company without him. It was a feeling of sinking, just as her first synchronization tests had felt – falling in a well without a bottom.  
就是这种感觉，她肩上的拉扯，一种陌生的感觉。在她认识这些面孔的一年里，总是和真嗣一起上学放学。从未有过没有他在场的时候。这是一种下沉的感觉，就像她的第一次同步测试——在一个没有底的井里坠落。

"You headin' home?" Suzahara asked.  
"你要回家吗？"铃原问道。

Rei could not answer. She was looking to the bike rack, one pristine white frame marred with a smudge of red. Pain tingled through her as her mind recalled the tumble, to warn her away from such things again. Home was quiet and cold and dark. Sheltered. A tremor ran through her. She could not leave, not yet. They had not left the rotting dog. Not when it would have been most reasonable to. Not when they had nothing to dig with, and cut their hands and legs, their seeping sweat stinging the cuts. Not when they stained themselves in filth to bury it.  
丽无法回答。她的目光停留在自行车架上，一尘不染的白色车架上沾染了一抹红色。疼痛如针刺般穿过她的身体，脑海中回想起那次跌倒，警告她不要再涉险。家是安静、冰冷和黑暗的。被保护着。她的身体微微颤抖。她还不能离开，至少现在不行。他们没有离开那只腐烂的狗。在最合理的时候没有离开。没有工具挖掘，他们割伤了手和腿，渗出的汗水刺激着伤口。他们没有因为弄脏自己而埋葬它。

"Ayanami?" Aida asked. "You're not mad, are you?"  
"绫波？"相田问道，"你没生气吧？"

Her jaw unclenched when he said it, and the hardness that had come to her features withdrew.  
听到他的话，她的下巴放松了，脸上原本的坚硬表情也随之消退。

"Hey, where ya going?" The two hurried to follow as she set a path to the bike rentals. She paid the fee once more.  
“嘿，你去哪儿？”两人急忙跟上，她径直走向自行车租赁处。她再次支付了租金。

"You're gonna ride it again? Idiot!"  
“你还要骑？真是个傻瓜！”

Sunset had deepened, lighting the caldera like a fire pit. Rei steadied herself atop the bike, both boys taking several steps back, one fuming, the other baffled.  
夕阳已深，照亮了火山口，宛如火坑。丽站在摩托车上稳住自己，两个男孩都退后了几步，一个气愤，另一个困惑。

A wild sensation climbed up her spine, like when she was in combat. Her palms beaded.  
一种野性的感觉沿着她的脊椎攀升，就像她在战斗中一样。她的手掌渗出了汗珠。

With a sharp breath, she gripped tight to the handles and pushed off.  
她深吸一口气，紧紧握住把手，猛地一推，冲了出去。

---

Each yellow and purple bruise was a splash of color on her pale legs, disrupted by patches of band aids and gauze.  
每块黄紫交错的瘀伤在她苍白的双腿上犹如一抹色彩，被创可贴和纱布的补丁打断。

"Rei. What happened?" Shinji dropped his bag, taking one of her arms. A wince tugged her face, but she didn't pull away.  
"丽。发生了什么？" 真嗣丢下书包，握住她的一只手臂。她眉头微皱，但没有抽回手。

"She fell off her bike," Aida said, hanging over his seat. Suzahara eased back, saying nothing. Something quivered under Shinji's skin.  
"她从自行车上摔下来了，" 相田说，靠在他的座位上。铃原往后靠了靠，一言不发。某种情绪在真嗣的皮肤下颤动。

"What are you doing?" Asuka leaned against his desk, a foot nudging him in the rear. "You can't just go touching people like that."  
"你在干什么？" 明日香靠在他的桌子上，一只脚在他身后轻轻踢了一下。"你不能就这样随便碰别人。"

Frowning, he reached out and flicked one of her earlobes, his middle finger whacking an orange sapphire. She yelped and cursed, flying into a tirade. Their classmates – embarrassed enough for the both of them – averted their attention, despite not being able to understand a word that was said. After a few more flicks and jabs, the two managed to sit down, and Shinji was able to turn back to Rei.  
他皱着眉头，伸出手弹了一下她的耳垂，中指敲到了一颗橙色的蓝宝石。她尖叫着咒骂起来，开始滔滔不绝地发泄。他们的同学们——已经为他们俩感到足够尴尬了——转移了注意力，尽管听不懂他们说的一个字。经过几次弹击和戳刺，两人终于坐了下来，真嗣得以转回对绫波的注意。

At least until the class rep stepped up. "Uh, Ikari, Soryu? could you please keep your conversations in Japanese? It's a little rude to..."  
至少直到班长走上前来。"呃，碇，惣流？你们能不能把对话保持在日语里？这样有点不礼貌……"

"Sure, Horaki," Shinji said, barring his full attention – Rei's bruises were of all colors, some purple, a few blue, and many yellow.  
“当然，班长，”真嗣说道，全神贯注——丽身上的瘀伤五颜六色，有些是紫色的，几处是蓝色的，还有许多是黄色的。

"I'll talk to Shinji in whatever language I want." Asuka said. She was popular here, just as she was anywhere else, but apparently not enough to get away with being inconveniently foreign.  
“我想和真嗣用什么语言说话都行。”明日香说。她在这里和其他任何地方一样受欢迎，但显然还不够，因为她是个不方便的外国人。

The girl before them deflated. "Just please try to be more considerate towards your classmates."  
面前的女孩泄了气。“请尽量多考虑一下你的同学们。”

"Fine." "好吧。"

A hushed curse left Suzahara's lips.  
须佐原低声咒骂了一句。

Shinji didn't remember standing, or balling his hands into fists. Suzahara was half out of his chair, one hand on the table, the other closed at his side.  
真嗣不记得自己是怎么站起来的，或是如何将双手握成拳头的。须佐原半起身离开椅子，一只手撑在桌上，另一只手紧握在身侧。

When he looked around, they released, and the eyes of the class were wide.  
当他环顾四周时，他们松开了手，班上同学的眼睛都睁得大大的。

It took what felt like a long time for Shinji to sit down. The room was still. Not even Asuka moved. He didn't want to look at her. A pressure started to crowd in, crushing and inescapable like the entry plug – he felt his breathing become sharp, his temple hot.  
对于真嗣来说，坐下来似乎花了很长时间。房间里一片寂静，连明日香也没有动。他不想看她。一种压迫感开始聚集，像插入栓一样沉重且无法逃避——他感到自己的呼吸变得急促，太阳穴发烫。

"Geht's dir gut?" Her lips whispered.  
“你还好吗？”她的嘴唇轻声问道。

He took a calming breath.  
他深吸了一口气，试图平复心情。

Lessons began in short order. He was called upon several times for answers by Nebukawa. The old bastard seemed determined to make an example of him today. Meanwhile he could feel eyes, Asuka's eyes, hanging onto the back of his head. Waiting for something.  
课程很快就开始了。他被 Nebukawa 多次点名回答问题。那个老混蛋今天似乎铁了心要拿他当典型。与此同时，他能感觉到目光，Asuka 的目光，紧紧盯在他的后脑勺上。等待着什么。

Always, he found his focus pulled as if attached by strings to Rei's bruises. Jitters poured through his hands and buzzed in his knees, his mind imagining some awful trauma she was hiding from him.  
总是这样，他的注意力仿佛被线牵引着，集中在 Rei 的瘀伤上。他的双手颤抖，膝盖发麻，脑海中想象着她对他隐瞒的可怕创伤。

Break came, at last. Dozens of voices echoed in the halls, shoes squeaking on the linoleum. Asuka pinched some of his hair and tugged. "Where are you going?"  
终于到了休息时间。走廊里回荡着数十个声音，鞋子在油毡上吱吱作响。Asuka 捏住他的一缕头发，轻轻拽了一下。"你要去哪儿？"

He shrugged and shouldered his schoolbag, heading the opposite way.  
他耸了耸肩，背起书包，朝相反的方向走去。

A shoe slapped the floor. "Shinji Ikari!"  
一只鞋子啪地一声拍在地板上。“碇真嗣！”

One of his hands waved at the air as he turned, answered by little more than a growl – a look telling him he was in deep, resentful waters.  
他一只手在空中挥了挥，转身回应，却只换来一声低吼——一个眼神告诉他，自己已深陷怨恨的漩涡。

After several flights of stairs, Shinji stepped out onto the roof. Tidal waves of summer air washed over him, drawing sweat from his skin before he'd taken more than a handful of steps. She was standing there, leaning on the railing. A small, blue silhouette against the gray of Tokyo-3.  
经过几段楼梯，真嗣走上了屋顶。夏日的空气如潮水般涌来，在他迈出几步之前就已让他汗流浃背。她站在那里，倚着栏杆。在东京-3 的灰色背景中，她是一个小小的蓝色身影。

"Rei. You tried riding a bike yesterday?"  
“绫波，你昨天尝试骑自行车了吗？”

He came alongside her, though she didn't answer – as it sometimes was with Rei. So he hummed, trying to fix the point she was hooked to out on the skyline. "With Suzahara and Aida?"  
他走到她身边，尽管她没有回答——绫波有时就是这样。于是他哼了一声，试图确定她所凝视的天际线上的那个点。“和铃原和相田一起吗？”

She shook her head. "On my own. They were simply there."  
她摇了摇头。“独自一人。它们就在那里。”

A breeze brushed them, and Shinji tried to piece it together. In a year of knowing Rei, she was as distant to him as the Kloster was half a world away.  
一阵微风拂过，真嗣试图将这一切拼凑起来。认识绫波已经一年了，她对他来说依然像半个地球之外的修道院一样遥远。

"It is familiar." “这很熟悉。”

He blinked. "Huh?" 他眨了眨眼。“啊？”

She thumbed the frayed edge of a band-aid, fingers gliding over a nebula pattern of purple and yellow.  
她用拇指摩挲着创可贴磨损的边缘，手指滑过一片紫黄相间的星云图案。

Shinji nodded, folding his arms over the railing. That, at least, he was sure they were not so distant on. "Are you going to try again?"  
真嗣点头，双臂交叉靠在栏杆上。至少在这点上，他确信他们并不遥远。“你打算再试一次吗？”

For that, she was present, giving the idea some thought. "Yes."  
为此，她也在场，对这主意思索了一番。“是的。”

"You'll just fall, and get more bruises, or worse."  
“你会摔倒，然后弄得更多瘀伤，甚至更糟。”

"That is very likely." “很有可能。”

The idea made his stomach twist. She could have told him, maybe then she wouldn't have gotten so hurt. Or maybe he wouldn't have made any difference at all. His right foot tapped the grit of the roof, making noise in the face of a city that seemed all too callous now. Beyond the skyline were the mountains of the caldera. Each had a name, and each had a spirit – a Kami like Asuka had told him about when they were kids. All of the names escaped him, but he'd been to some of the shrines.  
这个念头让他的胃一阵翻腾。她本可以告诉他的，或许那样她就不会受那么重的伤。又或许，他根本无济于事。他的右脚在屋顶的碎石上轻敲，在这座如今显得过于冷漠的城市中发出声响。天际线之外是火山口的山脉。每一座山都有名字，每一座山都有灵魂——就像明日香小时候告诉他的那些神灵。所有的名字他都记不清了，但他去过其中一些神社。

"The prayer," Rei said, looking at him now, "for the dog. What is it from?"  
“那段祷文，”绫波说，现在看着他，“是为那只狗的。它出自哪里？”

Shinji shrugged and shook his head. "The Bible. It's full of stuff like that. Every Wednesday we went to the church to worship. That one was just Father Luitpold's favorite."  
真嗣耸了耸肩，摇摇头。“《圣经》。里面充满了这类东西。每个星期三我们都去教堂礼拜。那段祷文只是路德普洛德神父的最爱。”

That was when the thought struck him, and he had to ask, "have you ever prayed Rei? To anybody?"  
就在那时，一个念头击中了他，他不得不问：“丽，你有没有向任何人祈祷过？”

She inclined her head slightly. This could mean either yes or no.  
她微微侧头。这既可能意味着肯定，也可能意味着否定。

"That's right… my father doesn't believe in anything either, does he?"  
“没错……我父亲也不信任何东西，对吧？”

"He believes in the Evas, I think."  
"他认为 Eva 是可信的，我想。"

"I wonder why. Because they'll save us? From the Angels?"  
"我好奇为什么。因为它们会拯救我们？从使徒手中？"

Rei shook her head. "Because he helped create them."  
绫波摇了摇头。"因为他参与了它们的创造。"

"So... they're like a part of him?"  
"所以...它们就像是他的一个部分？"

Her eyes dipped and she leaned over the railing. She stayed that way for a while, and he chewed on her words.  
她的目光低垂，俯身靠在栏杆上。她就这样停留了一段时间，而他则反复咀嚼着她的话语。

Lunch came to an end with neither eating a bite. Arriving at their class room with Rei in tow revealed an Asuka that was barred from him for the day. He muttered a greeting, and was rebuffed with her arm coming up like a wall for her head to lean on. By the end of the day, she was at least walking home with him, forgiven, until he had to board the line that took them separate ways.  
午餐结束时，两人都未曾动过一口。带着丽一起回到教室，发现明日香一整天都对他避而不见。他低声打了个招呼，却被她举起的手臂像墙一样挡住，她的头靠在上面。直到放学时，她至少愿意和他一起走回家，算是原谅了他，直到他不得不登上那条将他们分开的线路。

Tokyo-3's sprawl enclosed him, and he expected to hear sirens at any moment, or perhaps was desperate to.  
东京-3 的蔓延包围了他，他时刻准备着听到警笛声，或者也许是他迫切希望听到。

---

"Shinji. A word – in my office." Misato pushed off the wall she'd been leaning against. He stopped at threshold of the locker rooms, the material of his suit creaking as he stood straight – a stranger in front of her again.  
"真嗣。一个词——到我办公室来。" 美里从她靠着的墙上推开。他在更衣室的门槛前停下，他的制服随着他站直而发出吱吱声——再次在她面前变成了一个陌生人。

"I've already told Ritsuko to reschedule your test," she said, starting off down the corridor. A beat later his footsteps followed.  
"我已经告诉律子重新安排你的测试了，" 她边说边沿着走廊走去。过了一会儿，他的脚步声跟了上来。

The walk to her office felt longer than it had in months. He set himself in front of the mirror when they entered, facing her as she sat. Rigid, eyes locked on the wall behind her, limbs tight at attention. It wasn't unlike the way she had stood before the Commander for her after action reports, her gut trembling the whole way through.  
走向她办公室的路感觉比几个月前更长了。他们进去后，他站在镜子前，面对着她坐下。僵硬，眼睛紧盯着她身后的墙壁，四肢紧绷，笔直如柱。这与她向指挥官汇报战后情况时的站姿颇为相似，整个过程中她的内心都在颤抖。

"At ease." “放松些。”

Shinji parted his feet shoulder length and clasped his hands behind his back.  
真嗣双脚分开与肩同宽，双手背在身后。

Misato opened a folder and took up a pen, leafing through mundane paperwork that was of no particular importance right then and there, but made her look busy.  
美里打开一个文件夹，拿起一支笔，翻阅着那些此刻并不特别重要，但能让她看起来很忙的日常文书工作。

"How has school been?" “学校怎么样？”

A strangled pause. 一阵窒息般的停顿。

"Don't you have the reports?"  
"你不是有报告吗？"

Her hand stopped and she looked up.  
她的手停了下来，抬头看去。

"Sometimes I don't read them."  
"有时候我不看它们。"

Shinji's shoulders shifted, all of the oxygen in the room stifled.  
真嗣的肩膀动了动，房间里的氧气仿佛都被抽干了。

"It's been fine, I guess."  
“我想，还好吧。”

Misato nodded, licking a thumb and sliding on to the next review of her staff officers. She let the seconds tick. It only made the atmosphere less habitable, and a song from Yamashita began to play in her head. She stopped herself from humming along.  
美里点点头，舔了舔拇指，翻到下一页对她的参谋们的审查。她让时间一秒秒流逝。这只会让气氛更加难以忍受，山下的一首歌开始在她脑海中响起。她阻止自己跟着哼唱。

"The apartment looks nice," she said.  
"这公寓看起来不错，" 她说。

Attached to the file of one officer was a transfer request. Misato opened her ink pad and stabbed her seal into it. The smell of it stung her nose.  
一名警官的文件夹里附着一份调职申请。美里打开她的印泥盒，将她的印章按了进去。印泥的气味刺痛了她的鼻子。

"Asuka helped me clean." "明日香帮我打扫的。"

Her hanko thumped the left corner, blotted in red.  
她的印章重重地敲在左上角，红印清晰可见。

"Mm, good." “嗯，不错。”

Yamashita's song still played. She couldn't remember the name. She snatched another form requiring her perusal and approval.  
山下智久的歌还在播放。她记不起歌名了。她又抓起一份需要她审阅和批准的文件。

Her hanko met the ink pad again.  
她的印章再次触碰到印泥。

"I saw your Section 2 detail lost eyes on you for a few hours the other day."  
“前几天我看到你的第二科同事有好几个小时都在盯着你看。”

There was silence. Except silence might have been better. Instead she could hear the rustle of her jacket as she stamped her hanko. The scratching of her pen, or the thud of her seal, accompanied by the muted murmur of the base behind its walls.  
一片寂静。或许沉默还好些。然而她能听到自己盖章时外套的摩擦声，笔尖的刮擦，或是印章的沉闷声响，伴随着墙后基地的低沉私语。

Misato's fingers pressed hard against her pen and the paper tore beneath it.  
美里用力按着笔，纸张在笔下撕裂。

"Goddammit-" she tossed it across her desk. "Shinji, I'm just trying to talk to you."  
“该死——”她将纸团扔过桌面，“真嗣，我只是想和你谈谈。”

His eyes became vacant. 他的眼神变得空洞。

"Will that be all, ma'am?"  
"就这些了吗，女士？"

How nice it would have been to walk up and ring the insolence out of him. Instead, she swallowed her hurt and let the ache fall through her. She leaned back, arms folded tight over her chest.  
要是能走上前去，把他的傲慢敲打出来该多好。然而，她咽下了伤痛，任由那份痛楚穿透身心。她向后靠去，双臂紧紧抱在胸前。

"I suppose that's fair, isn't it?" She said, and despised how bitter it sounded. It was hard to look at him, at least as she was feeling then, being crushed under the weight of his eyes.  
"我想这很公平，不是吗？"" 她说道，厌恶自己声音中的苦涩。那时，被他的目光压得喘不过气来，她很难直视他。

They made her wonder, as she had in the past few months, just who this pilot-boy was. There were many things attached to the name Shinji in her mind, yet none of them seemed to encompass him, or give her understanding, or offer her solutions. They were simply him. All the same, she was learning everyday she didn't know who that was. Perhaps she hadn't cared until now, when it affected the nexus of her life.  
他们让她再次好奇，就像过去几个月里那样，这个驾驶男孩究竟是谁。她脑海中关于真嗣这个名字的联想很多，但似乎没有一样能完全概括他，或是给她理解，或是提供解决方案。它们只是他。尽管如此，她每天都在学习，发现自己并不了解他。也许直到现在，当这一切影响到她生活的核心时，她才真正开始在意。

A surge of guilt knocked the wind from her.  
一阵内疚感让她几乎喘不过气来。

"You scared me, you know?" She nudged her head, hair sliding away from her face.  
“你吓到我了，知道吗？”她轻轻摇头，发丝从脸颊滑落。

He'd let his hands fall, unsure now of where he was standing.  
他放下了双手，此刻已不确定自己身在何处。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

When you were trapped in your Eva. She heard herself say, except her lips never moved. When all I could do was stand in the command center and watch. When I had to –  
当你被困在 Eva 里时。她听到自己说，尽管她的嘴唇从未动过。当我只能站在指挥中心看着时。当我不得不——

Even in the privacy of her thoughts, she could not come to terms with the idea of him not being there.  
即便在内心的私密空间里，她也难以接受他不在那里的想法。

She remembered being trapped in a pod, crying for her father in the dark. It was disarming, being on the other side. She didn't want to have that helplessness again, but knew that she would. Knew that it was inevitable, so long as this boy occupied her home, her work, and her thoughts. It was just the way things were.  
她记得被困在一个舱里，在黑暗中哭喊着找爸爸。这种角色转换让人心慌。她不想再经历那种无助，但知道这不可避免。只要这个男孩占据她的家、她的工作、她的思绪，这就是无法改变的现实。事情就是这样。

Misato stood and made it to the other side of her desk, leaning her rear against the edge.  
美里站起身，走到办公桌的另一边，将臀部靠在桌沿上。

"C'mere." “过来。”

The boy obeyed and she reached out a hand to plunge into his hair and ruffle it up some. He ducked away and her weary expression tried for a smirk, a shallow giggle from her lips. So she hooked him under an elbow, roughing her knuckles over his head, and she was allowed this much.  
男孩顺从地低下头，她伸出手，插进他的发间，随意地揉乱了几下。他躲闪了一下，她疲惫的脸上勉强挤出一丝笑意，嘴角发出一声浅笑。于是她勾住他的肘部，用指节在他头顶摩挲，这是她被允许做的。

Misato let go and draped her arm over his shoulders, coaxing him to lean against the table with her. His stare gravitated to the floor, as it often did when he was uncertain.  
美里松开手，将手臂搭在他的肩上，引导他靠在桌边。他的目光习惯性地落在地板上，每当他感到不确定时，总是如此。

In the mirror across the way stood her reflection, a lanky boy tucked under her arm. It caught her how much he had grown in the last two years. He was as tall as her shoulders now, even slouched and with his head bowed. She looked to his chin, losing its childish curve, and how elegant his neck was, budding with the hint of his adam's apple.  
镜中映出她的身影，一个瘦高的男孩依偎在她臂弯下。她惊讶地发现，这两年来他长高了许多。即使驼着背、低着头，他的身高也已到了她的肩膀。她看向他的下巴，失去了孩童的圆润，脖颈显得优雅，隐约可见喉结的雏形。

"Hey," she said, squeezing. He looked up and found them in the mirror. His eyes filled again.  
“嘿，”她紧握着他的手说道。他抬头望向镜子，再次泪眼朦胧。

Shinji didn't need a mother, he was already growing up. Not that she would make a very good one anyway, even as a stand in. That was something she could never be. It wasn't her place in his life. He was staring at their reflection, and she knew he still wanted a mother, even though he was almost a young man.  
真嗣并不需要一个母亲，他已经渐渐长大。并非说她能成为一个好母亲，即便是作为替代。那本就不是她能扮演的角色。她在他的生活中没有那样的位置。他凝视着镜中的倒影，她知道，尽管他已近乎成年，内心深处仍渴望着母爱。

A buzzer roared to life and they were doused in red light.  
警报器轰然响起，红光瞬间笼罩了他们。

"_Pattern Blue detected. All hands to battle stations, level one."_  
检测到蓝色模式。全体人员进入一级战斗岗位。

### Chapter 5: Breakout
Shinji's hands settled around the induction levers – all of his readings were within tolerance, harmonics in resonance. Synchronization holding at a measly 53.1%. A full eight points lower than Asuka's.  
真嗣的双手搭在感应操纵杆上——所有读数都在允许范围内，谐波处于共振状态。同步率勉强维持在 53.1%。比明日香低了整整八个百分点。

"_Well, well, look who decided to join us,"_ she said, popping up on his Plug-HUD as if summoned. _"The Mighty Third Child, too good to bother with sync tests, is going to sortie with us."_  
“哎呀，看看是谁决定加入我们了，”她像被召唤般出现在他的插入栓 HUD 上，“伟大的第三适格者，连同步测试都懒得做，现在要和我们一起出击了。”

Misato spoke as his mouth opened. "_Keep the battle circuit clear unless necessary."_  
正当他张嘴欲言时，美里说道：“除非必要，保持战斗线路畅通。”

Asuka turned her nose at that. _"Hmph."_ Then, with a pointed look at him, threw out her tongue. To which his upper lip tugged in a silent snarl – though her feed winked out before it could be much of one.  
明日香对此嗤之以鼻。“哼。”随后，她朝他投去一个挑衅的眼神，伸出舌头。他的上唇随即拉扯出一个无声的怒吼——尽管她的画面在她做出更多动作之前就消失了。

He stared at the spot her face had been. Eight points. Shinji imagined she was over the moon about that – not that Asuka needed a reason to belittle him in front of people. Really, the sad state of his rate was just icing on the cake, he was sure.  
他盯着她脸曾经出现的地方。八分。真嗣想象她对此欣喜若狂——虽然明日香不需要任何理由就能在众人面前贬低他。真的，他那糟糕的评分只是锦上添花，他确信。

Shinji opened a private link to Rei's plug.  
真嗣向绫波的插入栓打开了一个私人链接。

"How are you feeling?" he asked, more to say something than because he didn't already know. Several cuts still cracked the white of her face and the rims of her eyes were dark. She leaned forward in the command chair and winced.  
"你感觉怎么样？" 他问道，与其说是真的想知道，不如说是为了打破沉默。她脸上的几处伤口依然清晰可见，眼圈周围也显得暗沉。她向前倾身坐在指挥椅上，不禁皱了皱眉。

"Your bruises?" "你的瘀伤？"

She shook her head. "They are not so severe," she said.  
她摇了摇头。 "不算太严重，" 她说。

Shinji hummed, looking off into Unit-01's cage. At least the LCL was usually kind to injuries. Although from the few times he'd had to test after a fight, he knew they soured with synchronization. At least her sync-rate was low. That might help some.  
真嗣哼着曲子，目光投向初号机的格纳库。至少 LCL 通常对伤口很友好。尽管他曾有几次在战斗后进行测试，知道同步率上升时它会变得苦涩。至少她的同步率很低。这或许能有所帮助。

"Ready?" “准备好了吗？”

Another nod, which he returned, slicing the feed and settling back in his seat. As Unit-01's systems rolled further into their startup, the concert of the Eva grafted him to the chair, his arms extensions of the induction levers. A wandering hum of chords slithered tighter in rhythm at that, playing on his nerves, giving them a solid density.  
他再次点头回应，切断通讯后重新坐回座位。随着初号机系统进一步启动，EVA 的共鸣将他牢牢固定在椅子上，他的手臂仿佛成了引导杆的延伸。此时，一段飘忽的和弦旋律更加紧密地随着节奏缠绕，刺激着他的神经，赋予它们一种实在的密度。

LCL thrummed in his lungs.  
LCL 在他的肺中嗡鸣。

_He could do this. 他能做到这一点。_

Their pre-launch checklists complete, a shudder ran through him as the Eva's platform jarred into motion – taking him to the launch pads alongside Units-00 and 02.  
他们的发射前检查清单完成后，随着 Eva 的平台开始移动，他感到一阵颤抖——带着他前往与零号机和零二号机并排的发射台。

"_Civilian evacuations have been completed."_  
“平民疏散已完成。”

"_Good, then we'll move to engage the target."_  
“好，那我们就准备行动，接近目标。”

Asuka's audio came in. _"What exactly are we supposed to be attacking?"_  
明日香的声音传来。“我们到底是要攻击什么？”

Misato appeared on their displays, the buzz of mission control bleeding through her feed. _"Here's what we have."_  
美里出现在他们的显示屏上，任务控制中心的嘈杂声透过她的信号传来。“这是我们掌握的情况。”

Several panels sprang up, one of them a live feed. The thing was hard to make out in any great detail as it swam through a sea of storm clouds. What he could see – a glowing sphere, perhaps no larger than the pyramid of Headquarters – moved at what seemed a fixed height over the mountains of Japan. Surrounding it in a protective cocoon were wide, flat sheets of silver that spun and jerked in an erratic orbit. They moved like cloth might, but also bent and pleated at random, shining as though made of metal.  
几块屏幕突然亮起，其中一块显示着实时画面。那东西在暴风云海中穿梭，细节难以辨认。他能看到的——一个发光的球体，或许不比总部金字塔大——在日本山脉上空以似乎固定的海拔移动。围绕它形成保护茧的是宽大、扁平的银色片状物，它们以不规则的轨道旋转并急动。它们像布料一样移动，但也随机弯曲和折叠，闪耀着金属般的光泽。

"_The target was first spotted crossing the Sea of Japan by Chinese SSF, and then detected by MAGI a few minutes later. It's already made landfall and will be making contact with the Nagano Defense Line shortly."_  
目标最初由中国特种部队在穿越日本海时发现，随后几分钟内被 MAGI 系统探测到。它已经登陆，很快将与长野防线接触。

Asuka's tongue clicked. "_Can you make it any clearer?"_  
明日香咂了咂舌。“你能说得更清楚些吗？”

"_We've tried getting closer, but it's maintaining a strict Exclusion Zone. The JSSDF has already lost a few fighters that skirted too close. As far as air support is concerned, they've pulled out of the op indefinitely."_  
"我们尝试过接近，但它维持着一个严格的隔离区。日本自卫队已经损失了几名过于靠近的战斗机。至于空中支援，他们已经无限期地退出了行动。"

"_Is there any other data on the target?"_ Rei asked.  
"关于目标还有其他数据吗？" 绫波问道。"

"_Nothing relevant to the operation. We'll have to proceed with our usual wait-and-see approach."_  
"没有与行动相关的信息。我们只能采取通常的观望策略。"

"_Got it."_ "明白了。"

_"Roger." "收到。"_

At last his Eva reached the launch bay, locking into its berth with powerful tremors. He felt the tethers run sharper through him, taking the pieces of his consciousness that drifted in the link and yanking.  
终于，他的 Eva 抵达了发射舱，伴随着强烈的震动锁定在位置上。他感觉到束缚在他身上的纽带更加紧绷，将他在链接中飘散的意识碎片猛地拉回。

A shrill siren sounded in the bay as the launch routes were cleared. Unit-02 shot upward. Followed by Unit-00.  
海湾中响起尖锐的警报声，发射路线被清空。零二号机冲天而起，紧随其后的是零零号机。

Then him. 然后是他。

Unit-01 thundered topside in short order, an AW MK II sniper rifle rolling up the deployment chute beside it. He snared it in the Eva's grip and entered Tokyo-3's deserted streets, out by the northern slopes of the caldera. The targeting system linked with his plug and he did a brief system check, glancing again at his sync gauge on the command console. Stable, for now. Harmonics in resonance.  
零一号机很快轰鸣着升至地面，一支 AW MK II 狙击步枪顺着部署滑道滚到它旁边。他将其握在 EVA 的手中，进入东京-3 空无一人的街道，位于火山口的北部斜坡外。瞄准系统与他的插入栓连接，他进行了简短的系统检查，再次瞥了一眼指挥台上的同步率表。目前稳定，谐波共振。

Doctor Akagi came into freq_. "Be advised, PWM concentrations have been steadily increasing since the Angel's approach. Proceed with caution."_  
赤木博士进入频率。“注意，随着使徒的接近，PWM 浓度一直在稳步上升。请谨慎行事。”

"_Understood."_ Rei said. “明白。”绫波说。

"_Screw that,"_ Asuka huffed under her breath.  
“去他的，”明日香低声嘟囔道。

His plug cable cleared, he maneuvered Unit-01 through the city blocks. Command, with their bird's eye view, highlighted the desired position with a waypoint. While en route, he keyed the system commands and patched into The JSSDF IFF network. The Air Force had cleared the skies alright, not even VTOL craft dared patrol the outskirts of the Angel's mass. Only the drones pinged on his display, far off.  
他的插头电缆清理完毕后，他操控着初号机穿梭于城市街区之间。指挥中心以其鸟瞰视角，用航点标出了目标位置。在行进途中，他输入系统指令并接入日本自卫队敌我识别网络。空军确实已将天空清空，甚至连垂直起降飞机都不敢在使徒质量场的外围巡逻。只有远处的无人机在他的显示屏上发出信号。

Thunder rolled over the hills, on the unfriendly side of the mountains. Dark clouds bulged and cracked.  
雷声在山的那一边滚滚而来，那是不友好的山脉。乌云膨胀并裂开。

Once at his post, Shinji sat Unit-01 – its back braced against a highway bridge – in a firing position like he'd been taught: ankles crossed, knees out wide and elbows resting atop them, stock at the crease under his shoulder. Unit-01's shoulder.  
到达岗位后，真嗣让初号机——背靠高速公路桥——摆出了他所学过的射击姿势：脚踝交叉，膝盖外展，肘部支撑在膝盖上，枪托紧贴肩窝。初号机的肩窝。

"_Ninety seconds to contact."_  
"九十秒后接触。"

His lips pursed. "Here it comes."  
他双唇紧闭。"来了。"

Shinji found Unit-02's marker, dead center of the projected attack vector, and followed it up. Ripples traveled through the stormy sky. Targeting markers sparked across it, erratic and confused – TARGET DESIGNATE: SANDALPHON(?)  
真嗣找到了二号机的标记，正中预设攻击矢量中心，并随之跟进。波纹在暴风雨般的天空中传播。目标标记如火花般散布，杂乱无章——目标指定：桑达芬（？）

"_How's our barrier?"_ “我们的屏障情况如何？”

"_Still holding. The MAGI can't seem to get a target tag."_  
“还在维持。MAGI 似乎无法获取目标标签。”

"_Open the conditions, have it grasp onto the highest output."_  
“放宽条件，让它抓住最高输出。”

"_All units expand your A.T. Fields, shrink the Exclusion Zone."_  
“各单位扩大 AT 力场，缩小隔离区。”

Shinji did so, leaning forward and focusing himself outward, as if an unseen part of him were being thrust into being. The pressure of the Eva at the base of his skull became lighter. Warmth beat from the plug-depth, the command suite sinking into it a little more. Shinji watched the gauge flutter.  
真嗣照做了，身体前倾，集中精神向外扩展，仿佛有一部分无形的东西被推入存在。位于他后脑勺底部的 Eva 压力减轻了。从插入栓深处传来的温暖，让指挥舱更深地沉入其中。真嗣看着仪表指针轻轻颤动。

Outside his Eva, temperatures spiked. Trees crashed and bristled. Heat waves shook the air, and beyond the mountains the Angel breached a swell of clouds – its metallic ribbons fighting an ethereal wind.  
在他的 Eva 之外，气温骤升。树木倒塌，枝叶颤动。热浪摇曳着空气，而在山脉之外，使徒冲破了云层的波涛——它的金属丝带在与虚幻的风搏斗。

---

Rei watched the distance tracker on her target fall rapidly, the computer imaging of the Plug-HUD blurring every so often while fireflies danced in rhythm with her heartbeat. Every inch of her tingled, caught in the nebulous feeling of being stretched out, plying pressure to the bruised tissue.  
丽看着目标的距离追踪器迅速下降，插头头盔的计算机图像不时模糊，萤火虫随着她的心跳节奏起舞。她身体的每一寸都感到刺痛，被一种朦胧的拉伸感所捕获，对淤伤的组织施加压力。

Soon, the Angel would be in range.  
很快，使徒就会进入射程。

"_Aoba, roll out the welcome mat."_  
“青叶，铺好欢迎毯。”

From behind her, cruise missiles launched in swarms towards the Angel and Tokyo-3's horde of heavy caliber artillery guns let loose a drumroll of fire, long seconds between each salvo as auto-loaders filled them for the next shot. Most impacted, leaving visible scoring that dissipated seconds later, and others missed due to the unpredictable twists and folds of its ribbon.  
从她身后，巡航导弹如蜂群般向使徒和东京-3 的重型火炮群发射，自动装弹机为下一轮射击填充弹药，每次齐射间隔数秒。大多数导弹命中，留下可见的痕迹，几秒钟后消散，而其他则因使徒飘带的不规则扭曲和折叠而偏离目标。

Unit-00 stayed locked, the onboard computer making the slight adjustments needed to keep her weapon on point.  
零号机保持锁定状态，机载计算机进行微调，确保她的武器始终瞄准目标。

Then, the barrage stopped.  
随后，炮火齐射停止了。

"_Target in range."_ "目标已进入射程。"

"_A.T. fields have made contact."_  
"A.T.力场已接触。"

"_All units, execute."_ "所有单位，执行。"

The frame of her rifle trembled as she released a controlled burst. Across from her, Rei caught a stream of light, followed by the buzz of Unit-02's rifle. Her bolts impacted the burning core. Shinji's rounds splashed into it a moment later. Smoke dispersed in the wind, revealing the core without a scratch on it.  
她的步枪框架在她释放一连串控制射击时颤抖着。对面，丽捕捉到一束光线，紧接着是二号机步枪的嗡鸣声。她的子弹击中了燃烧的核心。真嗣的射击片刻后也洒向了那里。烟雾在风中散开，显露出核心完好无损。

"_What?!"_ Soryu balked, sending another hail of fire. "_Isn't that the core?"_  
“什么？！” 索留惊愕地继续开火，“那不是核心吗？”

The Angel encroached unhindered.  
使徒毫无阻碍地逼近。

"_Unit-two, keep expanding your field, Unit-zero will move in to support you."_  
“二号机，继续扩大你的领域，零号机会移动过来支援你。”

"_I can do it myself!"_ Unit-02 advanced, tossing an empty mag. Earth cracked at her feet. _"There, I'm at maximum."_  
“我自己能行！”零二号机前进，扔出一个空弹匣。地面在她脚下裂开。“好了，我已经达到最大范围。”

Rei started to move, carefully so as not to lose the unit's footing on the ridge. Two more bolts came from the other side of the caldera, Unit-01's marker shaking. One round glanced the top of the orb, the other ricocheting off a plated tendril with an ear-ringing 'twang'.  
绫波开始移动，小心翼翼地不让机体在山脊上失去平衡。又有两发子弹从火山口的另一侧射来，初号机的标记在颤动。一发子弹擦过球体的顶部，另一发则从装甲触须上弹开，发出震耳欲聋的‘铛’声。

Light speared at them as a tendril snapped in Unit-01's direction, catching the sun in its silver surface. Pointed to a blade-like tip, it dragged through earth and trees and ripped into Shinji's position.  
阳光如利箭般射向他们，一条触手猛地朝初号机方向弹射，银色表面在阳光下闪耀。它尖如刀刃的末端划过大地与树木，直冲向真嗣的位置。

The marker stayed green as the ribbon arced around, making a dive for Unit-02, which rolled from the path.  
指示器保持绿色，触手带弧形绕转，猛扑向二号机，后者则翻滚避开其路径。

"_My rifle's gone."_ Shinji snarled.  
“我的步枪没了。”真嗣咆哮道。

"_There's another coming your way, marked on your HUD. Get there."_  
"你的 HUD 上标记了另一个目标，正朝你这边来。快去那儿。"

"_The Angel is about to cross over Muradake!"_  
"天使即将越过村岳！"

"_All units, fall back to your secondary positions! FPF-one inbound!"_  
"所有单位，撤回到你们的备用位置！FPF-1 正在接近！"

Over another frequency, an operator called in the fire barrier. Clouds of flame burst over the form of the Angel as artillery batteries on the other side of the lake rained down their payloads. The ones that missed threw up fountains of earth, the rattling '_whumps_' of the gun pieces reaching them moments after.  
在另一个频率上，操作员呼叫了火障。火焰云团在天使形态上爆发，湖对岸的炮兵阵地倾泻着它们的弹药。那些未中的炮弹掀起了一阵阵土柱，炮声的隆隆‘轰鸣’在他们耳边响起，稍迟片刻。

They dispersed a cloud of black smoke over the retreating Evas, so thick that Rei didn't see the Angel's tendril until a proximity warning told her it was right on top of her.  
他们向撤退的 Eva 散布了一片黑烟，浓密到连绫波丽都没能看到天使的触手，直到接近警报告诉她它就在她头顶。

---

"_We've lost contact with Unit-zero."_  
“我们与零号机失去了联系。”

Shinji's fingers ran cold, but he had to keep moving. The Angel's ribbon was arcing around for another pass.  
真嗣的手指冰凉，但他必须继续行动。使徒的缎带正划出一道弧线，准备再次攻击。

"_Her suit is still transmitting. Vitals are green."_  
“她的作战服仍在传输信号。生命体征正常。”

Gun fire reports reached him in the plug, all with the same result – an unscathed core. Shinji glanced at his A.T. field readings: high output, but fluctuating, no exclusion zone, and the bubble was declining fast, collapsing in isolated pockets.  
枪炮声在插入栓内回响，结果却如出一辙——核心毫发无损。真嗣瞥了一眼自己的 A.T.力场读数：输出量高，但波动不定，没有排除区域，且防护罩正迅速衰减，孤立的区域正在崩塌。

There was a tug on his spine as he pulled the induction levers, swinging his Eva around. He was on the outskirts of the city now, and braced Unit-01's back against a deployment block, foot planting firm into one of the taller buildings. Shinji let the targeter lock and hurled another two rounds at the core. Deeper in Tokyo-3's central blocks Asuka fired a burst, six rounds, which arrived simultaneously with his second shot.  
当他拉动感应杆，脊椎传来一阵拉扯感，他的 Eva 随之旋转。此刻他已身处城市的边缘，将初号机的背部紧贴着一个部署块，脚稳稳地踏在一座较高的建筑物上。真嗣让瞄准器锁定目标，又向核心投掷了两轮攻击。在东京-3 中心区域的深处，明日香发射了一连串六发子弹，几乎与他第二轮射击同时抵达。

Again, the core was pristine.  
核心依旧完好无损。

"_Why can't we damage it?!"_  
“为什么我们无法对其造成伤害？！”

"_My rifle's no good."_ "我的步枪不行。"

"_So do something about it!"_  
"那就想办法解决它！"

Reflected light bit into his eyes before a retort could answer, the proximity alert sounding on his left. Unit-01 twisted and pulled back, the Angel's ribbon crashing through the building he'd been using for support. A stabbing pressure hit him as his Eva completed its fall and caved-in an apartment complex, sniper rifle rolling into a public park and dashing the stone fountains.  
反光刺入他的眼睛，还没来得及反驳，左边的接近警报就响了起来。初号机扭身后退，使徒的带子穿过了他用来支撑的大楼。随着 EVA 完成坠落并压垮了一座公寓楼，一阵刺痛感袭来，狙击步枪滚进了公园，撞碎了石制喷泉。

Unit-01's prog-knife came free as he stood, gripped back-handed, just as the massive sheet of metal turned and closed on him. Shinji's heart tried to hammer out of his chest. Timed against the impulse lag, Unit-01 pivoted back and to the side as the ribbon would have cut into him, meeting his blade instead. A screeching like nails on glass blew out his audio-receivers as the blade sliced clean into the tendril. The thing diverted its course, but not before the prog-knife managed to cut through a quarter of the sheet.  
初号机的进度刀在他站立时松脱，反手紧握，就在那巨大的金属板转动并合拢在他身上时。真嗣的心脏几乎要从胸腔中跳出来。与冲动延迟同步，初号机向后侧转，本应被丝带切割的地方迎上了他的刀刃。一阵如同玻璃上划过指甲般的刺耳声响炸裂了他的音频接收器，刀刃干净利落地切入触手。那东西改变了路线，但进度刀还是成功切穿了四分之一的金属板。

Audio returned at the tail end of a shriek – and the ribbon withdrew sharply, its length squirming as it returned to coil around the red sphere. The Angel wrapped its metallic arms around itself in a ball. By now, it had come to sit over Tokyo-3 proper.  
尖叫声的尾声中，声音恢复了——丝带猛地收回，其长度蠕动着，重新缠绕在红色球体周围。使徒用金属臂将自己包裹成一个球。此时，它已经坐落在第三新东京市上方。

Light shifted, descending with the harsh burn of twilight. As though pulled by strings, the buildings tugged into the sky, their towering forms inverted.  
光线变换，伴随着黄昏的刺眼灼烧感缓缓下降。仿佛被丝线牵引，建筑物向天空拉扯，它们高耸的形态倒置。

Shinji wasn't sure when, but at some point, command had ordered another fire barrier. Hatches burst open along the skyscraper rooves and missiles streaked from their chambers. Autocannons fired from inter-city railway mountings and sent HE rounds barreling skyward.  
真嗣不确定具体是什么时候，但某个时刻，指挥中心下令再次设置火障。摩天大楼屋顶上的舱门猛然打开，导弹从发射室中疾射而出。城际铁路上的自动炮台开火，高爆弹呼啸着冲向天空。

Following their path, Shinji looked up – and there was Tokyo-3 above him. The buildings stretched seamlessly from the peaks of the city, with nothing but a blazing afternoon sky in place of any ground floor or an Angel.  
顺着它们的轨迹，真嗣抬头望去——东京-3 就在他头顶。建筑从城市山峰上无缝延伸，除了炽热的午后天空，没有任何地面或使徒的踪影。

Proximity alerts blared, just before the city works around Unit-01 shattered into small pockets of flame. They rattled him in the plug and Shinji braced, searching for a target above. Unit-02 disappeared from his Tactical, the word LOST flashing over the way marker alongside Rei's.  
接近警报声大作，就在初号机周围的城市设施碎裂成一团团火焰之前。这些震动让他插入了驾驶舱，真嗣稳住自己，寻找上方的目标。二号机的信号从战术屏上消失，“失联”二字闪烁在标记旁，与绫波的信号一同。

"_Fire Control–"_ "火控系统——"

"_All of the solutions MAGI gave us were correct!"_  
"MAGI 给出的所有解决方案都是正确的！"

"_Is it using its A.T. field to repel attacks?"_  
"它是在用 A.T.力场来抵御攻击吗？"

In a wash of color, the reflection vanished – and the Angel's silver armor unfurled, the ribbons snaking back and forth like a viper might. They lanced out, streaking for Unit-01 and pile-driving into concrete and metal as the Eva threw itself out of the way. His Plug-HUD locked onto a weapons depot, not far – _armament inbound_.  
在一阵色彩的洗礼中，倒影消失了——天使的银色盔甲展开，丝带如毒蛇般来回游走。它们猛地刺出，直奔初号机，将其从混凝土和金属的撞击中甩开。他的插入栓 HUD 锁定了不远处的武器库——军火正在运送中。

Gunfire rattled. Another splitting scream. Then the ribbons yanked back, coiling once more. The reflection returned.  
枪声噼啪作响。又一声撕心裂肺的尖叫。随后丝带猛地收回，再次盘绕。倒影重现。

Shutters sprang open as a fresh pallet rifle arrived. Targeting synced with his Plug-HUD as he took it in Unit-01's grasp. Shinji aimed down the narrow corridor above, where he remembered the Angel last, and opened fire. No sooner had the burst left the nozzle than bolts came plowing into Unit-01's armor. Shinji dropped to a knee and on thought impulse lifted the Eva's right arm to shield its head, the uranium depleted rounds pounding slag craters across the forearm plating.  
随着一批新到的步枪，百叶窗突然打开。目标锁定与他的插入栓 HUD 同步，他将其握在初号机手中。真嗣瞄准上方狭窄的走廊，那里是他最后见到天使的地方，然后开火。子弹刚从枪口射出，炮弹就猛烈撞击在初号机的装甲上。真嗣单膝跪地，本能地抬起初号机的右臂护住头部，贫铀弹在臂甲上砸出一个个熔渣坑。

Damage indicators flared.  
伤害指示灯骤亮。

"_Where is it?"_ "它在哪儿？"

The sky returned, streaks of silver snapping at sunlight as they sliced for what he assumed to be Asuka's position. Or Rei's.  
天空重现，银色条纹如利刃般追逐着阳光，直劈向他推测的明日香或绫波的位置。

Shinji hurled a volley at it, three of the rounds striking a distant tendril. Resistance from the umbilical pulled at his back. With a curse, he doubled back down his previous route, wondering if he'd run the umbilical line – only to find it buried in rubble several blocks down. "Damn." Ejecting the jack, he moved Unit-01 for the nearest connection port along his route. Another stream of fire punched the Angel's red core as he jammed in a new umbilical, smashing two of the connection prongs in his haste.  
真嗣向其猛烈开火，三发子弹击中远处的一条触手。脐带电缆的阻力拉扯着他的背部。他咒骂一声，沿着原路折返，心中疑惑是否跑错了电缆线路——结果发现电缆被埋在几条街外的废墟中。“该死。”他拔出连接器，操控初号机向最近的连接口移动。在匆忙插入新电缆时，又一串火力击中了使徒的红色核心，因急迫而折断了两根连接针。

A yellow triangle sprang up on his left, followed by the five-minute battery timer – _Warning: Low-Pwr_. The numbers ticked down, but slowly. Afternoon spilled over the air again, the inverted city glaring down at him.  
一个黄色三角形在他左侧弹出，紧接着是五分钟电池倒计时——警告：低电量。数字缓缓倒数，午后阳光再次洒满空气，倒置的城市耀眼地俯视着他。

"_The target has reestablished an Exclusion Zone – our grid is maxed."_  
“目标已重新建立隔离区——我们的网格已满载。”

"_We're not making a scratch on that core!"_  
“我们对那个核心毫无损伤！”

"Hang on!" Shinji tried to envision where he'd seen the Angel, over what cluster of buildings, bounding his Eva to the central block of the city. When he felt he was under the Angel's position, he planted Unit-01's feet wide.  
"等等！" 真嗣试图想象他曾在哪里见过使徒，在哪片建筑群上方，指挥他的 Eva 向城市中心区域移动。当他感觉自己处于使徒位置的正下方时，他让初号机双脚分开站稳。

"Expanding A.T. field!" "展开 A.T.力场！"

The gauge shot up. His command suite sank ever further into the plug-depth. Forces moved against each other, hexagonal waves flashing in brief optical tears. A sound like shattering glass fell over the valley, a ripple washing through the sky. The reflection stuttered.  
仪表迅速上升。他的指挥舱更深地沉入插入栓深度。力量相互对抗，六边形波纹在短暂的光学撕裂中闪现。一种如同玻璃破碎的声音覆盖了整个山谷，一道波纹横扫过天空。反射的光芒闪烁不定。

Whether by trust or instinct, or simply out of any other ideas, Misato was quick on her order.  
无论是出于信任、直觉，还是仅仅因为没有其他想法，Misato 迅速下达了命令。

"_SAMs - now!"_ “萨姆导弹——现在！”

Guided missiles packed with HE charges streaked for the opening. Veins bulged along his forehead, ready to pop, weight pummeling down on his neck and shoulders. A shower of dizziness fell over him. His A.T. gauges made frantic pings at the height of their trackers, and when Shinji dropped – grasping his chest because it felt like all of him had been spilled out – so did his field.  
装载着高爆弹头的制导导弹直奔缺口而去。他的额头上青筋暴起，仿佛随时都会爆裂，沉重的压力压在他的脖颈和肩膀上。一阵眩晕感席卷而来。他的 A.T.力场仪在追踪器的最高点疯狂作响，当 Shinji 倒下——紧抓着胸口，感觉自己仿佛被掏空了一般——他的力场也随之崩溃。

The sky mended. A warbling hum vibrated the air, the buildings tugged in a reflection – just before the SAMs would have made contact. They were swallowed in the reflection, raining down on the city a moment later. Shinji hunkered Unit-01 between a weapons depot and industrial block, just as the missiles impacted.  
天空愈合了。一阵颤音振动着空气，建筑在倒影中被牵引——就在地对空导弹即将接触之前。它们被吞没在倒影中，片刻后如雨般倾泻在城市上空。真嗣将初号机蜷缩在武器库和工业区之间，就在导弹撞击的那一刻。

When the smoke and debris settled, all remained still for a moment.  
当烟尘和碎片散去，一切静止了一瞬。

"Any eyes on Rei?" “有看到绫波吗？”

"_On your six, Unit-one."_ "在你六点钟方向，一号机。"

Shinji could barely make out the words, as though she were speaking to him underwater. Unit-01 turned to find her there, a rifle still in her hands, though it didn't look like it could fire another shot. Her unit was a bit torn up, but otherwise intact. His vision swam.  
真嗣几乎听不清她的话，仿佛她在水下对他讲话。初号机转身发现她在那里，手中还握着步枪，尽管看起来已经无法再发射一枪。她的机体有些破损，但整体还算完好。他的视线开始模糊。

"Misato, what should we do?"  
"美里，我们该怎么办？"

Red blurred across his field of view as Unit-02 dashed by, a fresh positron in its grip.  
红色模糊了他的视野，二号机疾驰而过，手中紧握着一枚新生的阳电子炮。

"Asuka, wait!" “明日香，等等！”

Her unit took the same stance he had moments ago, positron muzzle aimed skyward. A pulse of nausea struck him as her A.T. field washed over his, expanding. When that reached its threshold, the reflection started to crack – but it didn't break. Asuka didn't wait, spitting two beams of light skyward.  
她的机体摆出了与他片刻前相同的姿势，阳电子炮口指向天空。当她的 A.T.力场覆盖过来，扩张开来时，一阵恶心感袭来。当那力场达到极限时，倒影开始出现裂痕——但它并未破碎。明日香没有等待，向天际喷射出两道光束。

Those two bolts came back to split clean through her shoulder and leg. A holler. Unit-02 collapsed to one knee. Lying in wait, the reflection dropped, ribbons already unfurled and sweeping towards them. Unit-02 caught one in the leg, the Eva's movement stuttering from the shot that had just burst its knee to hot pulp. The ribbon sliced through its upper thigh armor, just about shearing the appendage off.  
那两道光束再次袭来，干净利落地贯穿了她的肩膀和大腿。一声惨叫。二号机轰然跪地。潜伏在侧的反射体俯身而下，缎带已然展开，向他们横扫而来。二号机腿部中招，刚刚被轰成碎肉的膝盖让它的动作一滞。缎带划过其大腿上部装甲，几乎将这条肢体齐根斩断。

Damage reports piled on top of each other.  
损伤报告接踵而至。

Shinji stood Unit-01, stock of the pallet rifle braced into its shoulder as he walked the Eva and held the trigger. A line of rounds peppered the Angel's ribbon. Shinji was close enough that most of the mag hit its mark. The silver arm recoiled.  
真嗣操控初号机站立，托着托盘式步枪的枪托抵在肩上，边走边扣动扳机。一连串子弹射向天使的缎带。真嗣靠得足够近，大部分弹药都命中了目标。银色手臂猛地一缩。

"Rei, take my rifle," he said. Unit-00 laid her damaged weapon at her feet and took it, turning to keep an eye on the sky, now deep red with their reflection.  
“丽，拿我的步枪。”他说。零号机将她损坏的武器放在脚边，接过步枪，转身继续监视着天空，此刻已被他们的倒影染成深红色。

Shinji came around the other side of Unit-02, which was struggling to haul itself up. He hooked his Eva's hands under the Unit's arms, interlocking them around its chest to start dragging. "Sorry, Asuka," he said. There was a catapult terminal nearby.  
真嗣从二号机另一侧绕过来，二号机正挣扎着起身。他让他的 EVA 双手钩住二号机的手臂，环绕其胸前开始拖拽。“对不起，明日香。”他说。附近有一个弹射终端。

"Quit being useless and get me a weapon!" she bit out, trying to keep her voice from breaking.  
“别再没用了，给我拿把武器来！”她咬牙切齿地说，努力不让声音颤抖。

"_No. All units, withdraw. Retreat and recover to the Cages."_  
"不，所有单位，撤退。退回笼中休整。"

---

"Well, what's the damage so far?" Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki said, put upon, as always. The glow of the tactical table lit up their faces, Hyuga on one side monitoring Bridge communications, jotting down time stamps for status markers on the Angel. Misato, standing to his right, pointed at Aoba's station and held out her hand. The preferred report dropped into it.  
""那么，目前损失如何？""副司令官冬月说道，一如既往地不耐烦。战术桌的光芒照亮了他们的面庞，日向在一侧监控桥梁通讯，记录着天使状态标记的时间戳。美里站在他右侧，指向青叶的岗位并伸出手，她偏爱的报告随即落入手中。

"Minor damage to infrastructure: some highways, rail lines and a few hundred residential homes in the suburbs. Downtown–"  
"基础设施轻微受损：部分高速公路、铁路线及郊区数百户住宅。市中心——"

"Spare me the civil assessments – that's for the city councils to figure out. The Evas?"  
"别跟我来这套官方评估——那是市议会该操心的事。EVA 们呢？"

Misato gave the stack back to Aoba, who was ready with another report. She scanned the sharpie highlighted lines. "Both Unit-zero and one suffered superficial damage to their armor systems, with exception to zero's communications array – totally blown out. It'll need to be gutted and replaced. Unit-two took extensive structural damage to the left leg. Full LCL bath and grafting, but the bio-layers won't be in optimal condition for at least eleven days, which will produce negative feedback during synchronization."  
美里将那一叠文件还给青叶，后者已经准备好下一份报告。她迅速扫过用马克笔标出的重点行。"零号机和一号机的装甲系统仅受到轻微损伤，除了零号机的通讯阵列——完全报废了。需要彻底拆除并更换。二号机左腿遭受了严重的结构性损伤。虽然可以进行全 LCL 浸泡和修复，但生物层至少需要十一天才能恢复到最佳状态，这期间同步率会受到影响。"

A corner of Fuyutsuki's mouth twitched and he searched the topographical map between them. "And what's our ability to intercept?"  
冬月嘴角微微抽动，目光在两人之间的地形图上搜寻。"那么，我们的拦截能力如何？"

"Through the floor. It's right on top of us. We can still deploy topside, but any attacks will be reflected by what Doctor Akagi has dubbed an 'inversion' field."  
从地板穿透。它就在我们正上方。我们仍可部署到地面，但任何攻击都会被赤木博士所谓的‘反转’场反射回来。

"Explain." 解释一下。

Ritsuko stepped away from Maya's terminal to join them. "So far, the Angel has been completely reactionary," she plied a few commands at the table's console, several recordings springing up. "The core has an independent relationship with the bands of material we see surrounding it, almost like they don't exist on the same wavelength at the same time – except for when this happens." She had the table display a clip of the ribbons wrapping around the core. "Here, they become one and the same. Harmonized."  
律子从真嗣的终端旁走开，加入他们。“到目前为止，使徒的行为完全是反应性的，”她在桌上的控制台操作了几下，几个录像片段随即弹出。“核心与我们看到的环绕它的物质带之间存在独立的关系，几乎就像它们不在同一波长上同时存在——除了这种情况发生时。”她让桌子展示了一段带状物包裹核心的片段。“在这里，它们合二为一，同步化了。”

"But we've made solid hits on the core," Aoba said.  
“但我们已经对核心造成了有效打击，”青叶说。

Ritsuko shook her head. "Without neutralizing its field. Which only becomes possible when it folds into this defensive posture."  
律子摇了摇头。“如果不先中和它的力场。只有当它采取这种防御姿态时才有可能。”

Fuyutsuki was half listening, mind split elsewhere. "And thus far our weapons have proved insufficient for penetrating this armor?"  
冬月半听半不听，心思分在别处。“到目前为止，我们的武器还不足以穿透这层装甲吗？”

"Which finally brings us to the inversion field. It isn't fault with the weapons so much as the window of time they have to strike the Angel in this state. As soon as it enters this protective cocoon, since the ribbons can clearly be seen to sustain damage," images of Unit-01's prog-knife attack and scouring from rifle fire peppered the display, "it uses its A.T. field to erect a field that reflects anything that enters, at any trajectory it chooses. Once a volley of something passes through, the field falters, but by then the Angel is ready to launch another attack. There have already been two observed instances where it has dropped the field prematurely."  
"最终，我们来到了逆向场。问题不在于武器本身，而是它们在这种状态下攻击使徒的时间窗口。一旦使徒进入这个保护茧，由于可以看到缎带明显受到损伤，"屏幕上闪现出初号机用进度刀攻击和被步枪扫射的画面，"它利用 A.T.力场建立一个反射任何进入物体的场，无论选择何种轨迹。一旦有东西穿过，力场会暂时减弱，但那时使徒已经准备好发动另一次攻击。已经有两次观察到它过早地放弃了力场。"

"So it uses this field as a screen to recover... how long is the target window?"  
"所以它用这个力场作为掩护来恢复...目标窗口有多长？"

"Approximately sixty-eight milliseconds according to the MAGI. Even with an opening like that, we still have to punch through its A.T. field."  
"根据 MAGI 的计算，大约是六十八毫秒。即使有这样的机会，我们仍然需要突破它的 A.T.力场。"

Misato folded her arms. "We have to be weakening it, right?"  
美里交叉双臂。“我们肯定在削弱它，对吧？”

"That's not how A.T. Fields work, unfortunately." The Doctor said, her lips making a flat line.  
“遗憾的是，A.T.力场不是这样运作的。”博士说道，她的嘴唇抿成一条直线。

"So why can't we breach it?"  
“那为什么我们无法突破它？”

"If we've learned anything about the Angels, it's that their A.T. field strength isn't static. The Eighth Angel's field is too strong for one Eva to neutralize the phase space – the buffer gap we call an Exclusion Zone – on its own. At least, not with the current synchronization rates."  
"关于使徒，我们了解到的是他们的 A.T.力场强度并非恒定。第八使徒的力场过于强大，单凭一台 EVA 无法中和相位空间——我们称之为排除区的缓冲间隙——至少在目前的同步率下做不到。"

"What would they need to be at?" Fuyutsuki asked, clasping his hands behind his back.  
""他们需要达到什么水平？"" 冬月问道，双手背在身后。

"One-hundred percent, but none of our pilots are even close to that."  
"百分百同步率，但我们的任何一位驾驶员都远未达到那个水平。"

"So they'll have to focus their fields in one area – together."  
"所以他们必须将各自的领域集中在一个区域——共同协作。"

"At least two of them."  
"至少其中两人。"

A hum of external noise engulfed the TACWAR room. Misato asked the question that was bubbling on everyone's thoughts. "Do we even have anything that can fire at that speed?" She already knew the answer, but it needed to be out there.  
TACWAR 室内充斥着外界的嘈杂声。美里提出了每个人心中都在翻腾的问题。“我们有什么能以那种速度发射的东西吗？”她其实已经知道答案，但这个问题需要被摆上台面。

Aoba shrugged. "The closest we had was the US developed railgun, which is marginally better than scrap at this point."  
青叶耸了耸肩。“我们最接近的是美国开发的轨道炮，现在勉强比废铁好一点。”

"No chance of making it operational again?" Misato asked, nodding to Ritsuko.  
“还有机会修复吗？”美里问，向律子点了点头。

"It's possible," she said after some hesitation. "Even firing at mach seven, our timing must be perfect."  
“有可能，”她犹豫了一下说，“即使以七倍音速发射，我们的时机也必须完美。”

"Let's assume this is our plan," Fuyutsuki released his hands, one coming up under his chin, "how do we deploy to the surface?"  
"让我们假设这是我们的计划，" 冬月松开了双手，一只手托在下巴下，"我们如何部署到地表？"

"Also problematic." Ritsuko jabbed a command on the tactical map, showing NERV's network of catapult lines. "We've tested this a few times the past couple hours, launching dummy payloads. It enters a Theta State before the catapult even reaches its threshold speed – a state of wakefulness."  
"同样有问题。" 律子在战术地图上戳了一个指令，显示出 NERV 的弹射线路网络。"过去几个小时我们测试了几次，发射了模拟载荷。它在弹射器甚至还未达到阈值速度之前就进入了 Theta 状态——一种清醒状态。"

"Then if we launch another sortie, it will have to be outside of the Angel's operational awareness?"  
"那么如果我们再次出击，就必须在使徒的行动意识之外进行？"

"Yes. The MAGI have already calculated a series of routes we could utilize, depending on load-out."  
"是的。MAGI 已经计算出一系列我们可以利用的路线，具体取决于装备配置。"

"It looks like several of the linear carriage lines have been severed. How recent is this damage?"  
"看起来有几条直线运输线路被切断了。这些损坏是何时造成的？"

Misato answered. "Only one of the lines was cut during the attack. The rest are from previous engagements we haven't been able to prioritize for repairs."  
美里回答道。"只有一条线路是在袭击中被切断的。其余的是之前战斗中受损，我们一直未能优先进行修复。"

"The Committee undercuts our budget and manpower and then wonders why nothing works. The Evas can't operate without support systems." The Sub-Commander sighed, meeting her eyes. "Well, we'll just have to make do, as always Captain."  
"委员会削减了我们的预算和人力，然后还奇怪为什么一切都不运转。没有支持系统，Eva 是无法运行的。"副司令叹了口气，与她对视。"好吧，我们只能像往常一样将就了，上尉。"

"Yes, sir." "是的，长官。"

"You made a good call pulling the units out. For now, we'll maintain Condition One alert status."  
"你撤回单位是明智的决定。目前，我们将保持一级警戒状态。"

A wash of relief poured through her. Misato had taken it as a bad sign that the Commander wasn't there. He was on base at the moment, but then, he wasn't expected to be a part of mission planning – they just needed his stamp of approval. It was just anxiety getting the better of her.  
一阵释然涌遍她的全身。美里原本以为指挥官不在是个坏兆头。他此刻确实在基地，但话说回来，他并不被期待参与任务规划——他们只是需要他的批准印章。这只是她的焦虑占了上风。

"Captain," Hyuga called, turning every head in the room, "you should take a look at this."  
“队长，”日向喊道，吸引了房间里所有人的目光，“你应该来看看这个。”

Misato made it to his side, followed by Ritsuko. His fingers worked across the keys. "For the past hour the MAGI have been signaling cut-off errors from outlying sectors of our defense grid. Five minutes ago we received a series of disposition reports from the Ministry of Defense, and the MAGI spat this out."  
美里走到他身边，紧接着是律子。他的手指在键盘上飞舞。“过去一小时，MAGI 系统一直在从我们防御网格的外围区域发出断连错误信号。五分钟前，我们收到了国防部的一系列部署报告，然后 MAGI 吐出了这个。”

Readings and analysis rolled down the screen.  
阅读和分析在屏幕上滚动显示。

"A barrier?" Ritsuko said.  
"屏障？" 律子说道。

"Communications seem to flow freely, but nothing physical can pass through. The MAGI surmise we've essentially been encased in a bubble."  
"通讯似乎畅通无阻，但任何实物都无法通过。MAGI 推测我们实际上已经被困在一个气泡中了。"

"That's why it's entered this pseudo-dormant state," the Doctor said, facing the Sub-Commander again, "it doesn't need to do anything more than protect itself and wait us out."  
"这就是它进入这种伪休眠状态的原因，" 博士再次面对副指挥官说道，"它只需要保护自己，等待我们耗尽。"

"This city has enough in surplus to function on rationed portions for six months."  
"这座城市有足够的储备，即使在配给的情况下也能维持六个月。"

Misato stood straight. "Can it afford to wait that long?"  
美里站直了身子。"它能等那么久吗？"

"Considering that an Angel's S-two Engine is a source of unlimited power – it could wait as long as it likes."  
"考虑到天使的 S-2 引擎是无限动力的来源——它想等多久就等多久。"

"So we have to deploy inside the perimeter."  
"所以我们必须部署在警戒线内。"

A gap of humming terminals filled the space between them. Fuyutsuki straightened, releasing another sigh through his nose. "I have to go contact the civil committee, and every other government official within a thirty-kilometer radius." He smoothed a hand through his gray hair and clasped his hands behind his back, turning to Misato before he reached the door. "I expect a full assessment and operation briefing in the next four hours."  
他们之间充斥着嗡嗡作响的终端设备。冬月挺直了身子，再次从鼻子里呼出一口气。“我得去联系市民委员会，以及方圆三十公里内的所有政府官员。”他用手梳理了一下灰白的头发，双手背在身后，转身对美里说，在到达门口之前。“我希望在接下来的四个小时内得到一份全面的评估和行动简报。”

Then he was gone. 然后他就消失了。

Everyone waited, having done enough mission planning with her by now to know – the first few minutes of silence were vital.  
每个人都等待着，与她一起进行过足够的任务规划后，他们都知道——最初的这几分钟沉默至关重要。

Misato went back to Hyuga's station, gripping the back of his chair. "Get our head of engineering on the line."  
美里回到日向的岗位，紧握着他的椅背。“联系我们的工程负责人。”

---

It was three hours later that Misato briefed them in one of the Ready Rooms and gave them each mission packets to study for the op. Asuka flipped through the pages, expression blank, harder to read thanks to the aviators she had pilfered from Misato's apartment while they were cleaning. A trophy, it seemed.  
三小时后，美里在其中一个准备室向他们简要介绍了任务，并给了他们每人一份任务资料以供研究。明日香翻阅着文件，表情漠然，由于她从美里公寓顺来的飞行员墨镜，她的情绪更难捉摸了。这似乎成了她的战利品。

"Where are we going to stay?" Shinji asked.  
“我们住哪儿？”真嗣问道。

Misato's teeth attacked her lower lip. "At home, like usual. Ritsuko says the Angel has entered a dormant state, and only becomes reactionary when Evangelions enter its field of awareness. Someone needs to look after PenPen anyway."  
美里的牙齿咬住了下唇。“像往常一样，在家。律子说使徒进入了休眠状态，只有在福音战士进入其感知范围时才会做出反应。反正也需要有人照顾 PenPen。”

Shinji nodded. They had only thirty minutes ago been allowed to leave their entry plugs so the pit crews could begin proper repairs on the units. The suit sticking to his skin was revolting. It felt like LCL clung to every part of him, even after drying off. Everything smelled and tasted like metal.  
真嗣点点头。他们仅在三十分钟前才被允许离开插入栓，以便地勤人员开始对机体进行适当的维修。紧贴皮肤的战斗服令人作呕。感觉就像 LCL 液体粘附在他身体的每一部分，即便已经擦干。一切都散发着金属的味道。

Once dismissed, they returned to the lockers. With the exception of Rei, who was scheduled for the first shift in the standby rotation. Shinji dwelled on how her bruises had fared during the battle. Maybe when he came to relieve her, she would tell him how it went.  
被解除了任务后，他们回到了更衣室。除了丽，她被安排在待命轮换的第一班。真嗣思索着她在战斗中受的伤势如何。也许当他去接替她时，她会告诉他情况如何。

Asuka was out in the corridor when he left the lockers, getting her things together in a small duffel bag. Damp hair clung to her bare shoulders. Next to her, a fig-leaf stamped stack of papers sat at the mouth of a trash bin. Shinji stepped closer and peered in.  
当他离开更衣室时，明日香正在走廊上整理她的小行李袋。湿漉漉的头发贴在她裸露的肩膀上。在她旁边，一个印有无花果叶图案的一叠文件放在垃圾桶口。真嗣走近一看，往里瞥了一眼。

"You threw it away?" "你把它扔了？"

"Duh." "废话。"

"You barely read it." "你几乎都没读过。"

She tossed her hair. "What's to know? I pilot my Eva and kill the Angel."  
她甩了甩头发。“有什么好知道的？我驾驶我的 Eva，消灭使徒。”

Shaking his head, he retrieved it between two fingers. "How are you going to do that?"  
他摇摇头，用两根手指夹起它。“你打算怎么做？”

"Weren't you listening? I'm going to have a railgun."  
“你没在听吗？我要装一个轨道炮。”

"That's not what the packet says."  
“那不是包装上写的。”

"What?" She spun and snatched the stack from his hands, slipping the sunglasses to the top of her head. She scanned for the right section.  
“什么？”她转身从他手中夺过那叠东西，将太阳镜推到头顶。她迅速浏览，寻找正确的部分。

"_**You?**_" Her face scrunched, and she shoved the packet against his chest. "Ugh!"  
“你？”她的脸皱了起来，将那张纸片猛地推到他胸前。“呃！”

Shinji stood there as she started off, looking rather stupid as the packet flopped to the floor. Or at least, he felt stupid. Asuka had that effect on him.  
真嗣站在那里，看着她离开，包装袋啪嗒一声掉在地上，显得相当愚蠢。或者至少，他感觉自己很愚蠢。明日香对他总有这种影响。

"Are you coming, or what?!"  
“你到底来不来？！”

He had to jog the last stretch to catch the elevator. Asuka watched behind her aviators, unsympathetic as he jammed his hand between the closing doors and bustled in when they parted. She settled in the back corner, arms crossed, and his gut folded in on itself. The girl was upset about something. She was always upset about something. His very existence seemed to be upsetting.  
他不得不小跑最后一段路才赶上电梯。明日香透过她的太阳镜在后面看着，毫无同情心地看着他把手挤进即将关闭的门缝，当门分开时匆忙挤了进来。她靠在后角，双臂交叉，而他的内心却纠结成一团。这女孩对某事感到不快。她总是对某事感到不快。他的存在似乎就是个错误。

At least most of the time he didn't feel like he did it on purpose. Still, it didn't seem fair to let the silence stand. It wasn't wrong for him to have the railgun position.  
至少大多数时候，他并不觉得自己是故意的。尽管如此，让沉默继续下去似乎并不公平。他拥有电磁炮的位置并没有错。

"I've always been a better shot than you," he said, at first to the doors.  
“我一直比你枪法好，”他最初是对着门说的。

He turned as she came at him, glasses sliding up again. She jabbed him in the chest. "That doesn't matter when a computer targeting system does all the work for you, so that can't be why. And it certainly can't be because of your sync rate. Any luck getting that back up?"  
她向他走来时，他转过身，眼镜又滑了上去。她戳了戳他的胸口。“当计算机瞄准系统为你完成所有工作时，这并不重要，所以那不是原因。当然，也不可能是因为你的同步率。有没有运气把它恢复过来？”

The words stung him. 那些话刺痛了他。

Levels clicked by, and Asuka stepped away, facing the door. Her arms crossed tighter and to Shinji she looked small – at least standing between his shadow and the door.  
电梯层数逐一跳过，明日香退开一步，面对着门。她的双臂交叉得更紧，在真嗣看来，她显得娇小——至少站在他的影子和门之间时是这样。

She tossed a glance at his feet. "Just spar with me, okay?" It sounded like a plea when she said it, and though she seemed tired of him today, he trailed behind her to the gym. They hadn't sparred since he nearly broke her fingers.  
她瞥了一眼他的脚。"就和我对练一下，好吗？"当她说出这句话时，听起来像是在恳求，尽管她今天似乎对他感到厌倦，他还是跟在她身后去了健身房。自从他差点弄断她的手指后，他们就再也没有对练过。

After some stretching, they squared up on the mats.  
经过一番拉伸后，他们在垫子上摆好了对峙的姿势。

Shinji stepped, fore-blocked, and sliced, but his heart wasn't in it – and she was agitated already, so he gave it to her. Several rounds went by with ease, and then several more. Red marks appeared on his arms. He made a sloppy parry and slipped in for a stab that he kind of knew he wasn't long enough to reach. Asuka stepped in, sliding his stab away, jabbing the blade into the base of his neck and then shoving him – hard.  
真嗣迈步，前挡，然后挥砍，但他的心并不在其中——而她已经很烦躁了，所以他让她占了上风。几个回合轻松过去，接着又是几个回合。他的手臂上出现了红印。他做了一个马虎的格挡，滑步向前刺去，心里隐约知道自己的距离不够。明日香上前，将他的刺击滑开，用剑尖戳向他的后颈底部，然后用力推了他一把。

"Come on! You're not even trying. It's pathetic."  
“来吧！你根本没认真。太可悲了。”

"I am trying." “我在努力。”

Her foot slapped the mats. "Bullshit! I don't need a pity win. If that's all you're gonna do then just go home."  
她的脚重重地拍在垫子上。“胡说！我不需要同情分。如果你就这点本事，那就回家去吧。”

Shinji sighed through his nose, picking up the blade. "Why are you so angry?"  
真嗣通过鼻子叹了口气，拾起刀。“你为什么这么生气？”

"Just forget it," she snarled, tossing the knife. It thumped against his chest.  
“别提了，”她咆哮着，将刀子扔了出去。刀子砰的一声砸在他的胸口。

Asuka went to the benches, stuffing everything back into her duffel before dropping her rear on the bench to shove her shoes on. All with her back to him. Shinji took another deep draw of air, his head shaking. Bending down once more, he retrieved her blade from the floor.  
明日香走到长椅旁，把所有东西塞回她的运动包里，然后一屁股坐在椅子上穿鞋，全程背对着他。真嗣又深吸了一口气，摇了摇头。他再次弯腰，从地板上捡起她的刀。

There were things he thought he should say, or that might have been better off said. They vanished as soon as he remembered how much more she'd rather throw them back in his face. He thought of how she was at school, how no one ever saw her like this. Only him. If they saw her this way, they probably wouldn't be so keen to flock around her and shower her with their praise, friendship and adulation.  
有些话他觉得应该说，或者本该说出来。但一想到她更愿意把这些话扔回他脸上，这些念头就立刻消失了。他想起了她在学校的模样，没有人见过她这样，只有他。如果别人看到她这样，可能就不会那么热衷于围着她，向她献上赞美、友谊和崇拜了。

It seemed she was only ever this difficult when in his immediate orbit. He did something to her that no one else did, and if it was so awful, he couldn't fathom why she stuck around. He might have known why, if they'd still been friends. As it was, he couldn't tell one way or the other.  
似乎只有在他身边时，她才会如此难以相处。他对她做了些别人做不到的事，如果这真的那么糟糕，他无法理解她为何还留在他身边。如果他们还是朋友，他或许能明白原因。但如今，他无法确定任何事情。

Asuka was just sitting at the bench, bag sagging limp next to her – hands holding onto the edge of the seat. Her head was hanging, and still she was facing away from him. Again, she seemed small.  
明日香只是坐在长椅上，书包无力地垂在旁边——双手紧握着椅子的边缘。她的头低垂着，依然背对着他。又一次，她显得那么娇小。

Shinji swallowed, a thumb rubbing over her knife.  
真嗣咽了咽口水，拇指摩挲着她的刀。

Every step he took was like walking through wet concrete, a familiar dread rising to choke him.  
每一步他都像是踏在湿混凝土中，一股熟悉的恐惧升起，几乎让他窒息。

"Just go already," she said, noticing his shadow over her.  
“快走吧，”她注意到他的影子笼罩着她，说道。

Shinji squatted. "Sorry."  
真嗣蹲下身。“对不起。”

"Shut up." "闭嘴。"

Again, the scalding need to keep his anger burned him. Air beat from the vents, settling over Asuka's silence. Letting his head slide, he found her bag easier to look at, lying just near his arm. A faded line cut his skin down its center, leading to his palm, where he held both of their knives.  
又一次，那股炽热的需要压抑怒火的渴望灼烧着他。空气从通风口涌出，覆盖在明日香沉默的氛围中。他让头缓缓垂下，发现她的包更容易注视，就躺在他手臂旁边。一条褪色的线条从他的皮肤中央划下，延伸至掌心，那里握着他们两人的刀。

"I just... didn't want to make you mad after today."  
“我只是……不想在今天之后再惹你生气。”

Asuka took in a sharp breath, then calmed, leaning back on the bench. He could tell her eyes were closed. "_Please_, shut up."  
明日香深吸了一口气，然后平静下来，靠在长椅上。他能感觉到她的眼睛是闭着的。“请，闭嘴。”

Shinji stood, offering the knife. "Come on, let's just spar some more."  
真嗣站着，递出刀。“来吧，我们再练练。”

Her head swiveled, regarding the blade, then she turned fully and snatched it from him. "Fine. But if you lose on purpose again, you'll regret it."  
她的头转动了一下，打量着那把刀，然后完全转过身，从他手中夺了过去。“好吧。但如果你再故意输掉，你会后悔的。”

Shinji decided to take the threat seriously, despite the lack of any real conviction behind it. At least, conviction as he had come to recognize it from Asuka.  
尽管威胁背后缺乏真正的决心，真嗣还是决定认真对待。至少，这是他自认识明日香以来所理解的决心。

He won the first few easy going matches as they settled into a rhythm again. Then she became serious, and the sight of it filled him with as much exhaustion as excitement. Bouts lasted only seconds as they traded wins and losses. Asuka was impatient for a streak, growling with each defeat. They seemed to feed her, to lump more coal on whatever fire she used to fight through her fatigue and win. There was no rest between matches. It wasn't long before each were taking ragged gasps. Another scuffle like the last seemed inevitable.  
他轻松赢得了前几场热身赛，两人逐渐找回了节奏。随后她认真起来，这一变化让他既感到疲惫又兴奋。比赛胜负交替，每次都只持续几秒钟。明日香急于连胜，每输一次就咆哮不已。他们似乎在给她加码，往她用来克服疲劳、赢得胜利的火焰上添更多的煤。比赛之间没有休息时间。不久，两人都开始喘着粗气。再像上次那样激烈打斗似乎不可避免。

"Last one?" he breathed. “最后一场？”他喘息着问。

She nodded. "Loser buys drinks."  
她点点头。“输的人请喝酒。”

Starting out, they circled one another for a time, occasionally jerking with false movements – to see if they could draw a reaction out of the other. A real fight didn't really look like this, they knew. But both of them just so happened to really want to win – and winning meant playing around with the other, until they made a mistake. One big enough to hurt.  
起初，他们互相绕圈观察，偶尔做出虚假的动作——试图引诱对方露出破绽。他们知道，真正的战斗并非如此。但两人都极其渴望获胜——而胜利意味着戏耍对手，直到对方犯下足以受创的错误。

She switched to an ice pick grip, because it was the easiest way to hook and cut at the same time. Shinji kept the hammer grip, where he was comfortable, and where he had a bit of range. He flicked his blade out several times, trying to catch her on a hand or wrist. For once, Asuka was patient, and timed one of his jabs – hooking it with her right arm before he could draw it back in. His knife-hand was drawn down as she scooped it, her other hand grabbing his while her wrist snapped down on the flat of his blade – knocking it out of his grip. But she'd slipped up: instead of taking the chance to cut him, she'd disabled him.  
她改用冰镐握法，因为这是同时勾划和切割的最简便方式。真嗣保持了他习惯的锤式握法，这样他既感到舒适，又有些许攻击范围。他多次快速弹出刀刃，试图击中她的手或手腕。这一次，明日香异常耐心，准确地抓住了他一次刺击的时机——用右臂勾住他的刀刃，阻止其收回。她的另一只手抓住他的手腕，同时手腕猛地下压在他的刀刃平面上——将刀从他手中击落。但她犯了个错误：没有趁机割伤他，而是选择让他失去武器。

Lashing out with his left hand, he snatched her knife arm while it was down. Asuka twisted out, but Shinji pulled her with his right hand, still in her grasp, and made her stumble in front of him.  
他伸出左手，猛地抓住她下落的持刀手臂。明日香试图挣脱，但真嗣用右手拉住她，依然在她掌握之中，迫使她在他面前踉跄。

Still, he was weaponless, and Asuka's blade came back up, even though he was still right on top of her. Shinji used his left forearm to scoop her knife-hand away, right hand shooting out to push her and create some distance. It landed on her chest, soft.  
尽管如此，他手无寸铁，而明日香的刀刃再次举起，尽管他仍紧贴在她上方。真嗣用左前臂将她的持刀手拨开，右手迅速伸出推开她以拉开距离。那只手落在了她的胸前，柔软。

By then he was dead.  
那时他已经死了。

He'd frozen, a fatal pause that allowed her to jab him in the gut. Her other hand planted itself on his face and pushed. Shinji stumbled, wondering when she would implode, if his hand had landed where he thought it had landed.  
他僵住了，致命的停顿让她得以刺中他的腹部。她的另一只手按在他的脸上并推开。真嗣踉跄后退，疑惑她何时会崩溃，如果他的手确实落在了他所想的位置。

Asuka ambled away towards the benches with a simple, "_I win_," and nothing else.  
明日香悠闲地走向长椅，简单地说了句，“我赢了。”便再无他言。

Shinji bought her a coke and himself a green tea. The bitter taste had grown on him.  
真嗣给她买了瓶可乐，自己则要了绿茶。那种苦涩的味道他已经习惯了。

"You have the next shift, right?"  
“你接下来有班，对吧？”

They were out in one of the lounges, cooling down. Shinji slipped the packet from his bag, flipping to the stand-by rotations. "Yeah, in... nine hours."  
他们在一间休息室里，正凉快着。真嗣从包里抽出那张纸，翻到待命轮换表。“嗯，在……九小时后。”

"Hm." Asuka found other pieces of the lounge to look at while upside down in her chair, hair nearly touching the floor. Really, everywhere but him. "With the city on lock-down, I don't really have anything to do."  
“嗯。”明日香在椅子上倒挂着，目光四处游移，头发几乎触地。实际上，她就是不看他。“城市封锁了，我也没什么可做的。”

Shinji took a long draw of tea. Asuka's feet kicked. He leaned back and let his head fall, giving himself a view of the magnificent egg-white ceiling.  
真嗣深深地喝了一口茶。明日香的脚踢来踢去。他向后靠去，头一仰，目光投向那宏伟的蛋白色天花板。

"I can ask– "我可以问——"

"I just let Misato know."  
"我只是通知了美里。"

Shinji shot up, finding her still upside down, but with a phone in her hands. "Oh, alright." He stood up then, tea can emptied, and slipped his duffel bag on. "Text me when you're on the way over."  
真嗣猛地站起来，发现她还是倒挂着，但手里拿着手机。“哦，好吧。”他站起身，茶罐空了，然后背上他的旅行袋。“你出发时给我发个短信。”

Asuka rolled upright. "Just come with me to my place so I can grab some stuff. I don't need a lot."  
明日香翻身站起。“跟我回趟家，我拿点东西。不需要太多。”

This turned out to be the greatest lie Shinji had ever been told.  
这成了真嗣听过的最大的谎言。

What should have been maybe a 10-minute excursion to her apartment turned into an hour. During which Asuka talked the entire time. Or it felt like it, packing a pair of suitcases, washing up in the bathroom, sending him on an impossible search for a hairbrush and a particular lip gloss she was always misplacing.  
本该是十分钟就能搞定的事，结果拖了一个小时。期间明日香一直在说话。或者感觉上如此，打包两个行李箱，在浴室洗漱，还让他进行了一场不可能完成的任务，寻找她总是乱放的梳子和某款唇彩。

The place was about as dysfunctional as Misato's room. Nothing had a secure home and was tossed about as needed. Were all girls this messy? Asuka's room had always been so prim and clean when they were kids. This couldn't be the same girl – and she had the gall to call him messy.  
这个地方和美里小姐的房间一样乱七八糟。什么东西都没有固定的位置，需要时就随手乱扔。难道所有女孩都这么邋遢吗？小时候明日香的房间总是那么整洁干净。这不可能是同一个人——而且她还有脸说他乱。

Tempted to goad her over it, he glanced around the living room again, settling on the closed door to her room. A shadow cut the small sliver of light at the bottom as she changed. He turned away.  
他本想借此逗弄她一番，又环顾了一遍客厅，目光落在她房间紧闭的门上。她正在换衣服，门缝下透出的一线光被影子切断。他转过头去。

Beside him on the kitchen counter top, just by the fridge, were cases of coffee and energy drinks. Dirty dishes were piled up in the sink – on both sides. Most of the cabinets were empty. Across the way in the living room, magazines and even some manga were sprawled over the coffee table, neither looking like they had been touched much. Empty noodle cartons sat stacked atop them. The place was... stifling and ached of something. Thoughts of his apartment, dark and bloated with trash, returned.  
厨房台面上，就在冰箱旁边，摆着几箱咖啡和能量饮料。水槽两边堆满了脏盘子。大多数橱柜都是空的。客厅那边，杂志和一些漫画散落在茶几上，看起来都没怎么被翻阅过。空面条盒堆在上面。这个地方让人感到窒息，弥漫着某种令人不适的气息。他不禁想起自己那昏暗、垃圾成堆的公寓。

She was living here all on her own.  
她一直独自一人住在这里。

That was something Shinji had known, ever since she had come to see him in the hospital after their first battle together. Still, seeing it made his heart sink.  
真嗣自从第一次并肩作战后她在医院看望他时就知道这一点。尽管如此，看到这一幕还是让他心情沉重。

She'd been alone in Heidelberg too.  
她在海德堡也是孤独一人。

Shinji shook his head. 真嗣摇了摇头。

No, she had Kaji while she was there, right? Asuka liked spending her time with him. Meanwhile, he was just sort of there. But perhaps that was better than no one. That's just kind of the way it'd always been.  
不，她在那里有加持先生，对吧？明日香喜欢和他在一起。而他呢，只是在那里而已。但或许这总比没人陪伴要好。一直以来，情况就是这样。

"Are you ready, or what?"  
“你准备好了没？”

Shinji jumped. Turning, he spotted her down the hallway by the front door, unsure when she had passed him. Asuka handed him the larger of the two suitcases, which he took without complaint, though she caught the face he made.  
真嗣吓了一跳。转身一看，她站在前门旁的走廊上，他不确定她何时从他身边经过。明日香递给他两个行李箱中较大的那个，他默默接过，尽管她捕捉到了他脸上的表情。

"Oh, shut up. You're a boy, aren't you?"  
"哦，闭嘴。你不是个男孩吗？"

He shuffled out behind her. "I just don't understand why you need all this stuff."  
他跟在她身后挪了出来。“我只是不明白你为什么需要这些东西。”

She flicked his nose. "You don't need to."  
她轻弹了一下他的鼻子。“你不需要懂。”

Once back at his apartment, Shinji brought out a spare futon and some blankets, trying not to remember that there was an Angel floating over their heads. While Asuka made a space for herself in the living room, he closed the blinds. Save for street and support lights – winking at the tops of buildings – the city was dark.  
回到公寓后，真嗣拿出备用的被褥和毯子，尽量不去想头顶上还飘着一个使徒。当明日香在客厅为自己腾出空间时，他拉上了百叶窗。除了街道和支撑灯——在建筑顶部闪烁——城市一片黑暗。

So they sat in the dark too, until the quiet began to bother Asuka and she told him to turn the TV on. Harsh light splashed the room, a late-night game show making enough noise that they didn't feel alone, and he lounged on one side of the futon. His shift started in seven and a half hours, so he set an alarm on his phone for 5:20, trying not to mourn the utter lack of sleep he would be getting that night. Maybe they would let him nap in the Cages while he waited for something to happen.  
于是他们也坐在黑暗中，直到寂静开始让明日香感到不安，她让他打开电视。刺眼的灯光洒满房间，一档深夜游戏节目发出足够的噪音，让他们感觉不那么孤单，他则懒洋洋地躺在被褥的一侧。他的班次在七小时半后开始，所以他设定了手机闹钟在 5:20，尽量不去哀悼那一夜将彻底失去的睡眠。也许他们会在他等待事情发生时让他小憩在笼子里。

"You ever think about home much?" Asuka asked. He looked at her, the flicker of the TV screen lighting up her face.  
“你经常想家吗？”明日香问道。他看着她，电视屏幕的闪烁照亮了她的脸。

"I haven't for a while," he said, laying his head back to take in the ceiling. "But I think I miss it."  
"我已经有一段时间没这样了，" 他说着，将头靠回椅背，凝视着天花板。"但我想我怀念它。"

"You _think_?" She asked, glancing down at him. The offense in her tone was unmistakable. His mouth twitched with an almost-smile.  
"你只是想？" 她问道，低头看着他。她语气中的不悦显而易见。他的嘴角微微抽动，几乎要露出微笑。

"I do." And it was true. He probably felt more at home back in Germany than he ever would in Japan. Hearing the language was something he missed, more than he thought possible when he spoke it again for the first time in a year. He missed the feel of Berlin, how every brick and lamp post carried a history – and quiet, sleepy Bernau. Traveling down the dirt roads to the train station. Riding it with Asuka to the Kloster in the mornings. The musty smell of the churches. Cool shade under the trees.  
"是的。" 这是真的。比起在日本，他可能更觉得在德国有家的感觉。再次听到那语言，比他一年未说时想象的还要怀念。他怀念柏林的感觉，每一块砖、每一根路灯杆都承载着历史——还有宁静的伯尔瑙。沿着土路前往火车站。与明日香一起乘坐火车前往早上的修道院。教堂里潮湿的气味。树荫下的凉爽。

They talked about what they might do once the war was over, though neither were so inventive that they suggested a life without the Evas. Until Asuka took it off the table.  
他们谈论着战争结束后可能会做的事情，尽管两人都没有那么富有想象力，以至于提出一个没有 Eva 的生活。直到明日香把这话题从桌面上撤下。

"Let's just say they defund NERV and put the Evas on ice or whatever. That wouldn't happen, but what would you do then?"  
“我们就假设他们削减 NERV 的经费，把 Eva 冷冻起来或者别的什么。虽然这不会发生，但那样的话你会做什么？”

"I dunno. I might join the military, become a fighter pilot or something."  
“我不知道。我可能会加入军队，成为一名战斗机飞行员之类的。”

"Didn't you want to play in concerts? You've still got your cello, right?"  
"你不是一直想在音乐会上演奏吗？你的大提琴还在吧？"

"Yeah, that's true." Even though he hadn't played for over six months.  
"是啊，没错。" 尽管他已经超过六个月没碰过琴了。

"Besides," she went on, "being a fighter pilot requires study and, you know, _hard work_. Something you obstinately refuse to do."  
"再说了，" 她继续道，"成为一名战斗机飞行员需要学习和，你知道的，努力工作。而你却固执地拒绝这么做。"

Obstinately. What a very Asuka word. He might have even laughed, but he couldn't deny that her observation brought with it an inflection of truth. Nor did he want to confirm it. For a while, he just watched the wheel on the TV spin, until at last it stopped.  
顽固地。真是个非常明日香式的词。他本可能甚至笑出声来，但他无法否认她的观察带有一种真实的意味。他也不想确认这一点。有一阵子，他只是看着电视上的轮盘旋转，直到最终它停了下来。

"I just don't care," he said, letting out the deep breath he'd been holding in. She didn't seem to know how to respond to that.  
“我只是不在乎，”他说，释放出一直憋着的深呼吸。她似乎不知道该如何回应。

The live audience cheered.  
现场观众欢呼起来。

"Of course you don't," she said.  
"当然你不会," 她说道。

They succumbed to the bright cacophony of colors and faces on the screen. The wheel spun and spun. Blinking became a chore, commercials lasted longer than the show and at some point, his head had fallen off the hand he'd propped up on an elbow. The futon was inviting and soft. Asuka's legs were in view, hugged close to her person.  
他们沉溺于屏幕上色彩斑斓、人声鼎沸的喧嚣之中。轮盘不停地旋转。眨眼成了负担，广告比节目还长，不知何时，他的头已经从用手肘支撑的手上滑落。沙发床既诱人又柔软。明日香的双腿映入眼帘，紧紧地贴着她的身体。

"Hey... Shinji?" "嘿... 真嗣？"

"Hnh?" Eyes heavy. Could sink into his breathing. Indistinct images ballooned. She asked him something, or his mind was beginning to dream – he understood the words, and they made sense, but he couldn't have told anyone what they were.  
“嗯？”眼皮沉重。能沉溺于他的呼吸中。模糊的影像膨胀开来。她在问他什么，还是他的意识开始做梦——他理解那些词句，它们有意义，但他无法告诉任何人它们是什么。

Because by then he was already well on his way to sleep.  
因为那时他已经在熟睡的路上了。

---

Misato wasn't sleeping at home again and she saw in his expression that was worrying him. Were the towering weight of her career not teetering on the edge of a knife with this mission, that might have been a nice thought. Especially after the last few months.  
美里又不在家睡觉，她从他的表情中看出这让他担忧。如果不是她的职业生涯因这次任务而岌岌可危，那或许是个不错的想法。尤其是在过去的几个月里。

Shinji set two cold coffee cans down on her commandeered desk within TacWar Room 1. The very same space she and her team had briefed Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki days earlier. That was just the routine, at least when an op lasted longer than the initial sortie. Misato wasn't one to leave or sleep soundly while others worked, not when she was expected to direct it all. Otherwise she wouldn't be caught anywhere near Headquarters while off the clock.  
真嗣在战术作战室 1 号内她征用的桌子上放下了两罐冰咖啡。就在几天前，她和她的团队还曾在这个地方向副司令冬月简报过。这不过是例行公事，至少当行动持续时间超过最初出击时是这样。美里不是那种在别人工作时自己离开或睡得安稳的人，尤其是在她被期望指导一切的时候。否则，她在下班时绝不会靠近总部一步。

So Shinji's delivery of caffeine blasted with sugar and B12 was a sweet gift. Though a beer might have been better.  
因此，真嗣送来的这罐加了糖和 B12 的咖啡因饮料，真是个甜蜜的礼物。虽然来瓶啤酒或许会更好。

"Thanks, kiddo," she said, cracking one open and taking a hefty swig.  
“谢谢你，孩子，”她说着，打开一罐，猛地喝了一大口。

He squatted, folding his arms on the table and resting his chin atop that. "Want anything else?"  
他蹲下身，双臂叠放在桌上，下巴搁在手臂上。“还要别的吗？”

A shake of her head, accompanied by a smile. Dressed in his plugsuit, she was reminded of his testing days with Gehirn at Lichtenburg – spinning in the control room chairs when he was bored, or trying desperately to decipher the readings from a tech's terminal. It had been so easy to tease him then, before he'd gotten all moody and serious.  
她摇了摇头，微笑着。穿着他的驾驶服，她想起了他在 Lichtenburg 与 Gehirn 测试的日子——无聊时在控制室椅子上转圈，或是拼命试图解读技术人员终端上的读数。那时捉弄他多么容易，在他变得阴沉严肃之前。

"How is she?" “她怎么样？”

One of his eyebrows quirked. "The... Eva?"  
他的一边眉毛微微挑起。“那个……伊娃？”

"Huh? No, Asuka. Why would I be asking about the Eva?" She laughed, nudging her head. "Ritsuko is right there."  
"嗯？不，明日香。我怎么会问起 Eva 呢？" 她笑着，轻轻点头。"律子就在那边。"

Shinji made a grimace and shrugged, thoroughly embarrassed. From another corner of the room their technician on observation duty, Hyuga, offered him a sympathetic smile. The man's eyes met hers and she nodded.  
真嗣做了个鬼脸，耸耸肩，感到非常尴尬。房间另一角的观察员技术人员日向，向他投来同情的微笑。他的目光与她相遇，她点头示意。

"Hey, Shinji," he said, standing from his terminal, "it's about time for my cage inspection with maintenance today, why don't you come with?"  
"嘿，真嗣，" 他说着，从终端站起身来，"今天我该去和维修人员一起检查机舱了，你要不要一起来？"

The boy blinked, standing. "Sure Makoto."  
男孩眨了眨眼，站起身来。“当然，真琴。”

Her tech shrugged on a bright orange nylon jacket and tucked his PDA under one arm, while Shinji jumped up to join him.  
她的技术员穿上了一件亮橙色的尼龙夹克，将 PDA 塞在腋下，而真嗣跳起来加入了他。

"Hey, you finished that manga I loaned you, right?" Hyuga asked, nudging his arm as they made for the door.  
“嘿，你看完我借你的那本漫画了吧？”日向问道，一边用胳膊肘轻推他，一边向门口走去。

Shinji's face lit up. "Oh, yeah! I wasn't expecting it to end that way. I thought Keiji and Rita were going to figure some way out together."  
真嗣的脸上露出了光彩。“哦，是啊！我没想到会是那样的结局。我以为圭司和丽塔会一起想出办法来。”

A shrug. "There was no other way to end the loop. One of them had to die."  
他耸了耸肩。“循环必须以某种方式结束。他们中必须有一个人死去。”

"Yeah, I guess... I just didn't think he would actually do it. Though I like that he painted his exoskeleton blue to remember her by."  
“是啊，我想……我只是没想到他真的会这么做。不过我喜欢他为了纪念她而把外骨骼涂成蓝色。”

Misato leaned back in her chair. "Don't forget to fill out your post-watch checklist before you leave!"  
美里靠在椅背上。“别忘了在离开前填写你的值班后检查清单！”

Shinji waved a hand. "Yes, ma'am!"  
真嗣挥了挥手。“是，长官！”

The door hissed shut after them, closing the two women in darkness again, which glowed with isolated civilizations of keyboard and terminal light. Wasn't that selfish of her. She'd rather have him whisked away than have him around for more than a few minutes. Even if it might've been in silence. There was too much work to be done, even if she was sitting in during her off hours, unpaid. Maybe neither of them was quite ready for casual conversation anyway. The trust wasn't there like it used to be.  
在他们身后，门嘶嘶作响地关上了，又将两位女性封闭在黑暗中，只有键盘和终端的光芒如同孤立的文明般闪烁。她这样做是不是太自私了。她宁愿让他被迅速带走，也不愿让他多待几分钟。即便可能只是沉默相对。有太多工作要做，即使她是在无薪的休息时间坐在这里。也许他们俩都还没准备好进行随意的交谈。信任已不复从前。

Misato turned right into Ritsuko's eyes. The woman had been able to read her since the first day they met. If she wanted, she could pay Misato back for the underhanded comment she'd delivered before the Angel attack. It was well within her right.  
美里转向律子的眼睛。自从他们第一次见面以来，这个女人就能读懂她的心思。如果她愿意，她完全可以为天使袭击前美里那句不怀好意的评论回敬一番。这完全在她的权利范围内。

Ritsuko's hair swayed as her attention withdrew, one hand typing at her terminal, while the other held up a PDA for reference.  
律子的头发随着她的注意力转移而摇曳，一只手在终端上打字，另一只手则举着 PDA 作为参考。

"It seems you two are on better terms. You've made up, then?"  
“看来你们俩关系好多了。你们和好了，是吗？”

Misato smirked, leaning back as far as the chair would allow. "I think. I don't really know."  
美里微微一笑，尽可能地向后靠在椅子上。“我想是吧。其实我也不太确定。”

"He's started bringing you gifts. Peace offerings. That's a step in the right direction."  
“他开始给你带礼物了。和平的象征。这是个好的开始。”

It would have been nice to agree, but she kept the thought to herself. Their attentions drifted apart for a time.  
虽然她本想表示赞同，但还是把这念头藏在心底。一时间，他们的注意力各自飘散。

Ritsuko sighed, setting her PDA aside. "Well, I've just finished speaking to the Crew Chiefs. There's a problem."  
律子叹了口气，将 PDA 放在一旁。“好吧，我刚和各班组长谈完。有个问题。”

"There always is," Misato said, priming a pen and taking a gulp of coffee. Back to business. "What is it?"  
“总是有问题的，”美里说着，拿起一支笔，喝了一大口咖啡。又回到了工作中。“是什么问题？”

Ritsuko let her glasses drop on their beaded lanyard. "We don't have the resources to fully restore the armor to pre-battle condition."  
律子让眼镜顺着珠链滑落。“我们没有足够的资源将装甲完全恢复到战前状态。”

"What do you mean? We've always done it before." Her pen clicked.  
“你这是什么意思？我们以前一直是这么做的。”她的笔咔哒一声。

"We've always had access to the other branches before." Ritsuko paused, anticipating another question. There was another click. "Evangelions are sheathed in an ablative weave, with more vital areas encased in titanium alloy, and a tungsten alloy over the chest plating for additional protection to the core unit."  
“我们以前一直可以访问其他分支机构。”律子停顿了一下，预料到会有另一个问题。又是一声咔哒。“福音战士被包裹在一种烧蚀编织物中，更关键的区域被钛合金包裹，胸甲上覆盖着钨合金，以增加对核心单元的额外保护。”

Misato leaned her head against a fist. "Yeah, I know the specs."  
美里将头靠在拳头上。“是啊，我知道这些规格。”

"Then you know how expensive it is to utilize these metals in such obscene quantities, not even counting production of the rest of the series."  
"那么你知道用这么多金属，还是这么贵的金属，得花多少钱吗？更别提生产整个系列的其他部分了。"

"Right, but Section four has their own manufacturing plants."  
"没错，但第四部门有自己的制造厂。"

"Raw materials are still limited. From what they've told me, under normal circumstances they would submit material or parts requests with our support branches depending on what repairs need to be made before putting in an order with a manufacturer. It's a waste to dump time and money into casting armor that may never need to be replaced. Especially with a metal as expensive as titanium. So I'm told."  
"原材料还是有限的。据他们所说，正常情况下，他们会根据需要修理的部分向我们的支援部门提交材料或零件申请，然后再向制造商下订单。把时间和金钱浪费在可能永远不需要更换的盔甲上，实在是太浪费了。尤其是像钛这样昂贵的金属。我是这么听说的。"

Misato would have liked to rip all of her hair out. "The armor _always_ needs to be replaced." She folded her arms on her desk and let her head fall on them. Deep breath, then a sigh. "What do we have on hand?"  
美里真想把自己的头发全扯下来。“装甲总是需要更换。”她将双臂叠放在桌上，头枕在上面。深呼吸，然后叹了口气。“我们手头有什么？”

"Enough spare pieces and materials to patch up Unit-two's chassis and Unit-one's arm."  
“足够多的备用零件和材料，可以修补二号机的底盘和初号机的手臂。”

"Well, that's just _perfect_." The former had sustained the most damage out of the Evas, aside from Unit-00, the repairs for which would have to be pushed back even further because of Unit-01. Zero's Cage crew was going to have a fit. She picked herself up.  
“好吧，这真是太完美了。”除了零号机外，前者是受损最严重的 EVA，而零号机的修理因为初号机的问题不得不进一步推迟。零号机的维修团队肯定会大发雷霆。她振作起来。

"Well, on top of that wonderful news, I've got to go meet with Yamazaki so he can give me the latest update."  
"好吧，除了这个好消息之外，我还得去见山崎，让他给我最新的进展。"

"Have fun," Ritsuko sang. Misato chugged her coffee in record time.  
"玩得开心，" 律子唱道。美里以创纪录的速度喝完了她的咖啡。"

"We're thirteen percent ahead of schedule." Yamazaki's hands slipped along the hips of his jumpsuit, startled at not finding pockets. A frown tugged at his bulldog face, sagging with age, and he folded his arms as they walked the command deck.  
"我们比计划提前了百分之十三。" 山崎的手沿着连体服的臀部滑过，惊讶地发现没有口袋。他那张像斗牛犬一样随着年龄下垂的脸皱起了眉头，边走边交叉双臂巡视着指挥甲板。"

"Power supply is still our biggest constraint," he said, pointing to pieces of data on the PDA in Misato's hand. "We've had to cannibalize some of the spare batteries for the Evas."  
"电力供应仍然是我们最大的限制因素，" 他指着 Misato 手中 PDA 上的数据说道，"我们不得不拆用了一些 Eva 的备用电池。"

"How many is some?" "多少算是一些？"

"Do you really want to know?" Her expression told him she didn't, not now at least, and he shrugged. She had, after all, given him leave to appropriate whatever was necessary. "If it's going to fire as fast as you need, there must be as much electrical energy moving through it as possible."  
"你真的想知道吗？" 她的表情告诉他她并不想，至少现在不想，他耸了耸肩。毕竟，她已经允许他征用任何必要的东西。"如果要达到你所需的射击速度，就必须有尽可能多的电能通过它。"

Misato nodded, unable to hide a grimace. A skeleton crew of technicians manned their stations, many others dark for the night.  
美里点点头，无法掩饰脸上的苦笑。一群技术人员组成的骨干队伍坚守在各自的岗位上，许多其他岗位则在夜间陷入黑暗。

She fixed him with a look. "And?"  
她用一种审视的目光盯着他。"然后呢？"

Yamazaki stared somewhere across the command deck; his voice hushed. "The gun will likely only survive one shot," he said. They kept their pace, slow and easy. "It will fire again, but not at the necessary muzzle velocity. It'll just get worse after every shot until the rails push each other apart because the electric currents are melting the damn thing."  
山崎凝视着指挥甲板的某个地方；他的声音低沉。"那门炮很可能只能承受一次射击，"他说道。他们保持着缓慢而平稳的步伐。"它还能再次发射，但无法达到所需的初速。每次射击后情况只会越来越糟，直到轨道因电流熔化而相互推开。"

"Why did you leave that out of your assessments?"  
“你为什么不在评估中提到这一点？”

"Would it have made a difference? You wouldn't have taken this up if it wasn't our most viable option. Morale is low enough as it is."  
“那会有什么不同吗？如果不是我们最可行的选择，你也不会接手这个任务。士气已经够低了。”

As much as she wanted to be annoyed, she could agree with his reasoning. Everyone just needed to believe the gun could work. That meant there was another layer of pressure resting on Shinji's shoulders, a weight he didn't even know was there.  
尽管她很想生气，但她不得不承认他的推理有道理。每个人都只需要相信这把枪能起作用。这意味着还有一层压力压在真嗣的肩上，一个他甚至不知道存在的重担。

"Whatever it takes," she said, and handed Yamazaki the PDA. "We'll adjust the operation guidelines. Have it ready."  
“不惜一切代价，”她说着，将 PDA 递给山崎，“我们会调整行动指南。准备好。”

Her senior by a number of years, the man held himself back at her tone. They were all tired, and NERV wasn't the place for bickering over showing proper deference. He nodded and made his way off the deck. Checking her watch, she would only be ten minutes behind him before Deck Officer Mibu came to relieve her. It would be about time for Asuka's rotation too.  
作为她的前辈，那男人在她语气下克制了自己。他们都疲惫不堪，NERV 不是为争论如何展现适当敬意而存在的地方。他点头后离开了甲板。查看手表，她只会比他晚十分钟，因为甲板官三部很快会来接替她。差不多也是明日香轮换的时间了。

Looking up, a sliver of red caught her eye, peeking out at the edge of the command tower.  
抬头望去，一抹红色吸引了她的目光，从指挥塔边缘窥视着。

"Asuka?" "明日香？"

The girl managed not to flinch, head turning away, before she spun out of cover. "Just came to check-in, as usual," she said, hands knitted behind her back. She looked off at the maps projected beyond the command deck, a somber pout playing on her face. A mind like Asuka's needed to be occupied.  
"女孩没有退缩，头转向一边，随即从掩体中转身而出。“像往常一样，只是来打个招呼，”她说道，双手交叉在背后。她的目光越过指挥甲板，投向远处的地图，脸上带着一丝忧郁的撅嘴。像明日香这样的头脑需要被占据。”

Misato studied her. "Good timing, my shift is just about up."  
美里审视着她。“来得正好，我的班次差不多结束了。”

There was no reaction beyond a slight nod as Asuka walked with long, playful steps, eyes still somewhere else. In fact, they were not looking at her at all. Perhaps because the girl knew that Misato had the ability to see something there she might not want her to. The girl wore everything in her eyes, ever since she'd been just a little red tumbleweed of fury. It seemed she hadn't grown out of it.  
"明日香迈着长长的、轻快的步伐走着，眼神依旧飘忽不定。事实上，她根本没有看向美里。也许是因为女孩知道美里有能力看到一些她可能不想让她看到的东西。自从她还是一个小小的红色愤怒旋风以来，她的眼中就承载着一切。似乎她还没有摆脱这一点。”

Misato decided to leave whatever secret she was keeping be and dismissed her to the Cages. Ever punctual, Mibu arrived a few minutes later and Misato was careful not to let her shoulders slouch as she left. Not while others could see.  
美里决定不去理会她所保守的秘密，将她打发到笼子里。三稻准时到达，只比预定时间晚了几分钟，美里小心地不让自己的肩膀松懈下来，就这样离开了。至少在别人能看到的时候不能。

---

His apartment became the meeting place. If Asuka wasn't there, then Rei was, and vice versa. Always there was someone in his apartment. Always there was a girl.  
他的公寓成了聚会地点。如果明日香不在，那么丽就会在，反之亦然。总是有个人在他的公寓里。总是有个女孩。

Asuka, like she did with every place she inhabited, traipsed around like she owned the place. Eating their food, using their bathroom, pouring through the few manga he owned and even hijacking his SDAT – blowing through his tapes all day while he was on shift.  
明日香就像她对待每一个居住的地方一样，大摇大摆地走来走去，仿佛这里是她的地盘。吃他们的食物，用他们的浴室，翻阅他仅有的几本漫画，甚至霸占他的 SDAT——在他上班的时候一整天都在用他的磁带。

It wasn't different, her being in his space and lording over his things. It was more that she was different. He wasn't entirely sure how to approach it, or why it was so estranged and daunting. Asuka had grown slender. Every part of her was slim: from her lips, her fingers, and even her toes. Not that she didn't have muscle – he knew from experience that she did, built up from their training. What _was_ there wasn't pronounced, just lean. And then there were parts of her that had... grown.  
她在他空间里主宰一切，这并没有什么不同。更多的是她变了。他不太确定该如何应对，或者为何这般疏远且令人畏惧。明日香变得苗条了。她身体的每一部分都纤细：从她的唇，她的手指，甚至她的脚趾。并非说她没有肌肉——他从经验中知道她有，那是他们训练积累起来的。那些肌肉并不显眼，只是修长。而她身体的某些部分……确实长大了。

Even thinking about it swallowed him in an ocean of embarrassment, and he'd end up going for a walk or taking a long, cold shower trying to empty his mind and think about nothing like the monks did.  
光是想到这些就让他陷入尴尬的海洋，他最终会去散步或洗个长时间冷水澡，试图清空思绪，像僧侣那样什么都不想。

Beyond all that, he was tired. They were five days in and Shinji couldn't remember being quite so exhausted before. There wasn't really a moment to himself unless he was sleeping. Asuka, left to her own devices, found any myriad of things to occupy her time – and then there were times all of them absolutely had to involve him in some way.  
除此之外，他很疲惫。他们已经五天了，真嗣记不清自己何时如此筋疲力尽过。除了睡觉，他几乎没有属于自己的片刻。明日香自己找事做时，总能找到无数的事情来打发时间——而有时，这些事情又绝对需要他以某种方式参与其中。

On a day like that, the only moment he had time to himself was when she was sleeping or in the shower. And today had very much been one of those days. Just that morning she'd woken him up by pinching his nose closed until he coughed himself awake.  
在那样的日子里，他唯一能独处的时间就是她睡觉或洗澡的时候。而今天，非常明显就是那样的一天。就在今早，她还通过捏住他的鼻子直到他咳嗽着醒来这种方式叫醒了他。

This Asuka was not the Asuka he'd seen off the plane a month ago, or the one who'd sat by his hospital bed, or the one who argued with him incessantly at school – and yet she was. It was more like someone had moved into her skin and was very much trying to act like the Asuka he remembered, slipping up here and there with their inconsistencies.  
这个明日香不是一个月前他在飞机上送别的那位，也不是坐在他病床边的那位，更不是在学校里与他争论不休的那位——然而她又是。这更像是有个人搬进了她的身体，非常努力地试图扮演他记忆中的明日香，时不时地因为那些不一致而露出破绽。

Lost in this internal crisis, he didn't quite hear her when she said, "hey, Shinji. Could you brush my hair?"  
沉浸在这场内心的危机中，他没有完全听到她说的话，“嘿，真嗣。你能帮我梳梳头发吗？”

She plopped down on his left, turned halfway so she could still watch Super Sentai on the TV. Handing him the brush, she threw her hair over her shoulders. Still a bit damp, it came down to the middle of her back and he scooted closer to reach all the way. He'd done this a few times before already, and plenty more back when they were kids. The first time, he'd asked her why she couldn't do it herself – to which she thwacked his knee with the flat of the brush, sat down with her back to him, and held it over her shoulder.  
她一屁股坐在他的左边，转过身来还能继续看《超级战队》。她把梳子递给他，然后将头发甩到肩上。头发还有点湿，垂到背中部，他挪近了些以便够到全部。他已经做过几次了，小时候更是常做。第一次时，他问她为什么不自己梳——结果她用梳子拍了他的膝盖，背对着他坐下，把梳子举到肩后。

This was not an offer to be refused.  
这是个不容拒绝的提议。

As usual after around ten minutes, Asuka growled – impatient with his slow pace – and snatched the brush from him to rip the remaining knots out.  
像往常一样，大约十分钟后，明日香不耐烦地咕哝了一声——嫌他动作太慢——夺过梳子，三下五除二地扯掉了剩下的结。

"I'm thirsty," she said, wandering to the kitchen and sliding the fridge open. "Hey, what does Japanese beer taste like?"  
"我渴了。" 她边说边走向厨房，拉开冰箱门。"嘿，日本啤酒是什么味道？"

Shinji turned. "Like most other beers, I guess."  
真嗣转过身来。"大概和其他啤酒差不多吧。"

"Have you tried these?" Asuka wiggled one of the Yebisu cans.  
"你试过这些吗？" 明日香摇晃着一罐惠比寿啤酒。"

"Nope." He held out his hand and she grabbed a second one for him.  
"不行。" 他伸出手，她又递给他一个。

Much like when he'd run amok in Berlin with Swina, having Asuka there made Shinji care less about any rules he might be breaking. In fact, he felt more and more like he wanted to get away with breaking them, so long as he had a partner in crime.  
就像他和斯维娜在柏林胡闹时一样，有明日香在身边，真嗣对打破任何规则的顾虑少了许多。事实上，他越来越觉得，只要有个同伙，他愿意打破这些规则。

Asuka snapped her lid open as she sat down, and they both took a sip at the same time. He'd had alcohol enough times before, they both had. It was just a natural part of growing up in Germany. Little glasses of wine, every so often beer, given to them on holidays and special occasions and more often than not after dinner.  
明日香坐下时啪的一声打开盖子，两人同时喝了一口。他之前喝过几次酒，他们俩都喝过。这在德国是成长过程中自然而然的一部分。偶尔的小杯葡萄酒，时不时来点啤酒，在节日和特殊场合，以及大多数晚餐后都会享用。

So Shinji was sure he'd never tasted anything so sour in all his life.  
所以真嗣确信，他这辈子从没尝过这么酸的东西。

Asuka made a face and shuddered. "She actually drinks this garbage?"  
明日香做了个鬼脸，浑身一颤。“她居然喝这种垃圾？”

"Like water." “像喝水一样。”

She looked at it, pained, then her expression tightened. Asuka took another gulp, face fouling again. Shinji laughed, standing to dump his in the sink.  
她痛苦地看着它，随后表情变得紧绷。明日香又猛灌一口，脸色再次变得难看。真嗣笑着站起身，把他的那份倒进了水槽。

"What the hell? You're not gonna finish it?"  
“搞什么鬼？你不打算喝完吗？”

"Nah, this stuff is awful."  
“不，这玩意儿太难喝了。”

Sitting beside her again, she became rueful. Outside he could see the shadow of the Angel from where it hovered in the sky.  
再次坐在她身旁，她显得有些懊悔。在外面，他能看到天使的影子，它正悬浮在空中。

For the next hour Asuka made further attempts at her beer while they wondered how to break the siege, though Shinji could figure no other way out. Those brilliant ideas he'd had as a child to fix the world and save it were just an absurd fantasy. He was embarrassed for even remembering them. Really, he knew next to nothing about anything, and felt all the more stupid for being where he was.  
接下来的一个小时里，明日香继续尝试她的啤酒，同时他们思考着如何打破僵局，尽管真嗣想不出其他出路。那些童年时用来修复世界、拯救世界的绝妙想法，现在看来只是荒谬的幻想。他为自己还记得这些而感到尴尬。实际上，他对任何事情都知之甚少，身处此地更让他觉得自己愚蠢至极。

"Do you think we'll have to stay this way?" He asked.  
“你觉得我们得一直这样下去吗？”他问道。

"What do you mean?" "你什么意思？"

"I don't know. Like, what if we can't beat it?" He watched her hands hover over manga pages. Clean and pink nails. Her beer can was between her legs, still half full.  
"我不知道。比如，万一我们打不过它怎么办？" 他看着她的手悬停在漫画页上。干净粉嫩的指甲。她的啤酒罐夹在两腿之间，还剩一半。

"That's dumb. Of course we can." she said. Then, in a whisper. "We have to."  
"那太傻了。我们当然能赢。" 她说。然后，低声细语。"我们必须赢。"

On the TV, explosions burst, throwing the heroes in their bright power suits across the ground. Not a scratch on them as they jumped to their feet. Bad guys came running in, swinging in wild arcs. Sparks flew.  
电视上，爆炸四起，将身着鲜艳战衣的英雄们抛向地面。他们毫发无损地跳起身来。坏蛋们冲了进来，挥舞着疯狂的弧线。火花四溅。

"You should give me the gunner position."  
"你应该给我炮手的位置。"

Shinji sat straight. "Why?"  
真嗣坐得笔直。“为什么？”

A shrug. "Because you can't miss," she said, not looking up from the book.  
她耸了耸肩。“因为你不会失手，”她一边说，一边没有从书上抬起头来。

"It's up to a computer targeting system, remember? I _actually_ can't miss."  
"这是由电脑瞄准系统控制的，记得吗？我实际上不可能打偏。"

She chewed on her words. "Well, if you blow it, then we might not get a second shot."  
她斟酌着用词。"嗯，如果你搞砸了，那我们可能就没有第二次机会了。"

"So I guess I'm just a screw up no matter what."  
"所以我想无论怎样，我都是个搞砸一切的人。"

Asuka was unphased. "Don't be so dramatic."  
明日香不为所动。“别这么夸张。”

Humiliation rippled through him. He was on his feet then. "That, or you can't stand not being in the spotlight. You've always been like that."  
羞辱感在他心中蔓延。他随即站起身来。“要么就是，你无法忍受不在聚光灯下的感觉。你一直都是这样。”

Her eyes flashed, mouth tight.  
她的眼中闪过一丝怒意，嘴唇紧抿。

"You must get a kick out of seeing me lose all the time."  
"你一定很喜欢看我每次都输的样子。"

Asuka didn't blink. "Take that back."  
绫波没有眨眼。"撤回那句话。"

"Which one?" He huffed, moving into the kitchen, searching for some chore or another. Asuka wouldn't let him win that easy and gave chase, catching him by the fridge.  
"哪一句？"他哼了一声，走进厨房，寻找着什么活儿干。绫波不会让他这么轻易得逞，紧随其后，一把抓住他的冰箱。

"All of it. Take it back."  
"全部拿回去。"

He backed away. She pursued. Her cheeks were flushed, he assumed from the beer, and she was right in his face. There was nowhere to go with the fridge at his back.  
他后退一步，她紧追不舍。她的脸颊因啤酒而泛红，她直逼到他面前。背后是冰箱，无处可退。

"Fine. Whatever," he said, glaring at the TV instead of her.  
"好吧，随便你，"他说着，怒视着电视而非她。

"Say it!" A hand pressed him against the appliance.  
"说出来！" 一只手将他按在电器上。

"I take it back." "我收回那句话。"

Asuka took her hand away and stepped back, almost covering a stumble. She stood there in the kitchen, arms folded, not looking at him.  
明日香收回手，后退一步，差点绊了一下。她站在厨房里，双臂交叉，没有看他。

Shinji went to the door and slipped his shoes on.  
真嗣走到门口，穿上鞋子。

Several heartbeats passed. Asuka appeared down the hall. "Where are you going?"  
几下心跳的时间过去。明日香出现在走廊那头。“你要去哪儿？”

"Out," he said, sliding into the corridor and turning his phone off as he entered the stairwell.  
“出去，”他说着，滑进走廊，进入楼梯间时顺手关掉了手机。

---

Emergency NERV lines were still running to the GeoFront, and he took one of these down to Headquarters. It seemed like the most logical place to look first. However, Shinji found her office empty and dark. Everything in its place and undisturbed. The closed lotus flower drifted on the windowsill.  
紧急 NERV 线路仍在通往地底都市，他搭乘其中一条前往总部。这似乎是最合逻辑的首选地点。然而，真嗣发现她的办公室空无一人，一片漆黑。一切井然有序，未受打扰。窗台上，一朵闭合的莲花静静漂浮。

Standing in the desolate halls of Headquarters, a trickle of thought suggested it might be easier to go and see Rei instead. She was on shift after all and was likely sitting on the grated platform beside her Eva in the cages, _Pale Fire_ splayed open in her hands. Yet the idea hesitated and trembled in his chest.  
站在总部荒凉的走廊中，一丝念头闪过，或许去找绫波会更简单。毕竟她正在值班，很可能坐在她的 EVA 旁笼子里的格栅平台上，手中摊开着《苍白火焰》。然而，这个想法在他心中踌躇不前，微微颤抖。

What if his father was there too?  
如果他的父亲也在那里呢？

Rei had never flaunted that special bond she had with him – and it _was_ special. It was something he didn't have, maybe might never have. The First Child, at least in his father's world, was elevated. Worth his attentions. Despite that, they got along alright, though the more Asuka invaded his life, the less he could say he understood it.  
丽从未炫耀过她与他之间的那种特殊纽带——而那确实是特别的。那是他所没有的，或许永远也不会有的东西。在他父亲的世界里，第一适格者是高高在上的，值得他关注。尽管如此，他们相处得还算不错，但随着明日香逐渐侵入他的生活，他越发觉得自己无法理解这一切。

Then there was the bike, and her growing and changing collection of injuries. Rei had taken a step somewhere away from him, or maybe they'd never been that close. Maybe she'd always been away from him, but at least now he felt the distance. Ever since they had buried the wolf-dog together.  
还有那辆摩托车，以及她不断增加和变化的伤痕。丽似乎已经从他身边走远了一步，或者也许他们从未那么亲近过。也许她一直都在远离他，但至少现在他能感受到这种距离。自从他们一起埋葬了那只狼狗之后。

After wracking his brain, and warring with his indecision, a new destination came to mind.  
在绞尽脑汁并挣扎于犹豫不决之后，一个新的目的地浮现在脑海中。

Shinji took a dirt maintenance road leading west of Headquarters, out to the hills where the GeoFront level shelters were buried. None of the transit shuttles were running because of the lockdown order, but that was fine with him. Sand crunched under his shoes, bits of broken seashells scraping as he walked. Much like his hikes topside in the mountains, the thick scent of pine burned his nose. He filled his lungs with it as the breeze picked up.  
真嗣沿着一条通往总部西侧山丘的泥土维护道路前行，那里埋藏着 GeoFront 层的避难所。由于封锁令，所有交通班车都已停运，但这正合他意。沙子在他的鞋下嘎吱作响，破碎的贝壳碎片在他行走时刮擦着。就像他在山顶山间徒步时一样，浓郁的松树香气灼烧着他的鼻子。随着微风渐起，他深吸了一口这股气息。

On the other side of Headquarters, crooked cracks crept up the GeoFront wall, still draped with an elaborate network of scaffolding and lifts. Even from where he was, he could catch the flash and waterfall of sparks as pieces of it were cut away and replaced.  
在总部的另一侧，GeoFront 墙面上蜿蜒着歪斜的裂缝，仍覆盖着错综复杂的脚手架和升降机网络。即便在他所在的位置，也能捕捉到火花闪烁和瀑布般倾泻的景象，那是部分结构被切割替换时的情景。

Shinji came 'round a bend to an open clearing and stopped.  
真嗣绕过一个弯道，来到一片开阔的空地，停下了脚步。

Off the road, there were four patches of dirt spaced in meticulously measured squares. A tiller and hand shovels, along with bags of fertilizer, were piled nearby. In boots, jeans, and a white tank top, a man was hunched over at work. Dark hair hung free over his shoulders, the rest of it covered by a white towel draped atop his head like a nun's habit.  
路旁有四块精心测量过的方形泥土。犁和手铲，还有几袋肥料堆在旁边。一个男子穿着靴子、牛仔裤和白色背心，正弯腰劳作。乌黑的头发随意披散在肩上，其余部分则被一块白毛巾覆盖，像修女的头巾一样搭在头顶。

He had a small pallet of plants beside him, ready to be kneaded into the moist earth, though Shinji couldn't tell what kind they were. Brown tubes crept through the dirt sporadically, like a burrowed snake. At some point he'd hooked up a drip line and half-buried it to water his garden directly.  
他身边有一小堆植物，准备栽种到湿润的土壤中，但真嗣认不出它们是什么种类。棕色的管子像潜伏的蛇一样在泥土中蜿蜒。不知何时，他接上了一条滴水管，并将其半埋起来，直接给花园浇水。

Shinji moved closer, knowing he was somehow privy to a hidden moment. At least until the man's head lifted, perhaps sensing another's eye on him. Turning, his face came into full view, a face Shinji had seen many times before. Bitter recognition cut into him.  
真嗣走近了一些，意识到自己无意中窥见了一个私密的瞬间。至少在那个男人抬起头之前，或许是察觉到了别人的目光。他转过身来，真嗣看到了那张熟悉的面孔，无数次出现在他的记忆中。苦涩的认知刺痛了他。

Kaji smiled. "Well, well, Shinji Ikari, we cross paths again," he called, standing straight.  
加持笑了。“哎呀，哎呀，碇真嗣，我们又见面了，”他站直了身子喊道。

Unsure of how to respond, he merely stood there, hoping his silence and his stare conveyed enough how little he appreciated the sight of the man. When Kaji began to speak, Shinji turned and started walking.  
不知道该如何回应，他只是站在那里，希望自己的沉默和凝视能充分表达出他对这个男人的出现有多么不悦。当加持开始说话时，真嗣转身开始走开。

Even when he was called after, he stayed forward, his shoulders stiff. Rapid footfalls punched the gravel, getting louder.  
即使听到身后有人叫他，他依然继续前行，肩膀僵硬。急促的脚步声踩在碎石上，越来越响。

"Hey, wait," Kaji said, thumping to a halt next to him and taking a few ragged breaths.  
“嘿，等等，”加持说着，猛地停在他身边，喘着粗气。

"What?" "什么？"

An odd look crossed Kaji's face as he studied him. "Oh, that's funny," he said, a grin spreading once more. The man's dimples were pronounced. He must have smiled a lot. "You have the same look Asuka does when she's angry. In your eyes – it's exactly the same." He said, a finger poking at the bridge of his nose.  
加持打量着他，脸上掠过一丝奇怪的表情。“哦，真有趣，”他再次咧嘴笑道，那人的酒窝很明显。他一定经常笑。“你的眼神和明日香生气时一模一样。就在你的眼睛里——完全一样。”他一边说，一边用手指戳了戳自己的鼻梁。

Shinji jerked away, blinking. "Okay," he said, moving on again.  
真嗣猛地躲开，眨了眨眼。“好吧，”他说着，继续前行。

Kaji followed. "So, what brings you out here?"  
加治跟了上去。“那么，是什么风把你吹到这里来了？”

"It's private," he said, wishing the man would just go back to his planting. Out in the GeoFront, of all places. He wondered if that was even allowed. "What are you doing out here?"  
“这是私人事务，”他说，希望那人能回到他的种植中去。在 GeoFront 这种地方，他甚至怀疑这是否被允许。“你在这里做什么？”

"Oh, it's private," Kaji answered, a smarmy grin in his voice. "But really, I'm just out here planting watermelons. Used to love 'em as a kid. The soil is rich and the climate is perfect. They can't get enough of summer."  
“哦，私人事务，”加治回答，语气中带着一丝狡黠的笑意。“但实际上，我只是在这里种西瓜。小时候就喜欢它们。这里的土壤肥沃，气候也正合适。它们对夏天可是爱不释手。”

Shinji grunted, trying to pick up his pace, which the older man matched.  
真嗣咕哝着，试图加快步伐，年长的男人也紧随其后。

"Why watermelons you ask?"  
“为什么是西瓜，你问？”

Shinji didn't, but Kaji carried on.  
真嗣并没有问，但加持继续说了下去。

"Back when I was going to University in Tokyo-two, I had this nineteen-seventy-seven Toyota Celica." He took his time saying it. 'Sell-ee-caa'. "It's Latin, meaning 'heavenly'. It didn't have nearly as much horsepower as the next gen models – real racing cars. And by the time I got my hands on it, I was basically fixing something every week. But it was stylish. Had a fat engine that made lots of hood space. There wasn't much sitting room, so that was great for, uh," the man considered him, then glanced up, scratching at his chin. "Well, me and Misato used to drive out to the coast, no one really used the roads there anymore. We'd find a place along the beach to park and collect driftwood for a bonfire. We'd drink beer and slice up watermelon, listening to the crash of the waves. Ah, I do miss that car."  
"那会儿我在东京二号大学读书时，有一辆 1977 年的丰田赛利卡。" 他慢条斯理地说着，'赛-利-卡'。"这个词源自拉丁语，意为'天上的'。它的马力远不及下一代车型——那些真正的赛车。等到我入手时，基本上每周都得修点什么。但它很时髦，拥有一个硕大的引擎，车头空间充足。车内空间不大，所以非常适合，呃，" 那人打量着他，然后抬头挠了挠下巴，"好吧，我和美里常开车去海边，那里的路几乎没人用了。我们会在海滩上找个地方停车，捡些浮木生篝火。我们会喝啤酒、切西瓜，听着海浪拍岸。啊，我真怀念那辆车。"

A deep sigh. "But unlike cars, I can always grow more watermelons."  
一声深长的叹息。"但与汽车不同，我总能种出更多的西瓜。"

"She's... never mentioned stuff like that."  
"她……从未提起过这些事。"

Shinji couldn't help but feel a little betrayed. There was a Misato he didn't know. Maybe wouldn't ever know. Who wasn't yet a Captain of NERV, or even a soldier. Who had different hopes and ideals and... sat by bonfires on beaches eating watermelons. Not that he had any delusions about where he resided in Misato's world. Even so, it seemed everyone knew her better than he did. Worse, this man especially so.  
真嗣不禁感到有些被背叛。有一个他不知道的美里。也许永远都不会知道。那个还不是 NERV 的队长，甚至不是士兵的美里。有着不同的希望和理想，以及...坐在海滩篝火旁吃西瓜的美里。并不是说他对自己在美里世界中的位置有任何幻想。即便如此，似乎每个人都比他更了解她。更糟糕的是，这个人尤其如此。

"I'm not surprised," Kaji said, his tone wistful. "And how is the intrepid Captain?"  
"我并不惊讶，" 加持说，语气中带着一丝怀念。"那么，这位勇敢的队长怎么样了？"

"She doesn't want to see you."  
"她不想见你。"

That made him laugh. "So Ritsuko tells me."  
这让他笑了起来。“所以是律子告诉我的。”

"You know her?" “你认识她？”

"Yeah, we were all in college together. I used to flirt with her all the time – it was the best way to get Misato's attention."  
“是啊，我们大学时都在一起。我以前经常和她调情——这是引起美里注意的最佳方式。”

Kaji just knew everyone then, didn't he?  
那时加治肯定认识所有人，对吧？

"So, this top-secret mission of yours."  
“那么，你这个绝密任务。”

"I'm looking for someone. In the shelters."  
“我在找一个人。在避难所里。”

Thoughtful, the man gazed skyward. "Why don't I help you look?"  
沉思中，那人仰望天空。“为什么不让我帮你一起找呢？”

Shinji shrugged, clinging to hope that he would just get bored and leave. To spur this on, he made no conversation as they followed the road, despite Kaji's attempts to draw more out of him.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，抱着一丝希望，希望他会感到无聊并离开。为了促成这一点，尽管加持试图从他那里套出更多话来，他一路上没有进行任何交谈。

"How has Asuka been? You two getting along?"  
“明日香最近怎么样？你们俩相处得还好吗？”

At that, Shinji sighed. "Why does everyone ask me that? Shouldn't you know?"  
听到这话，真嗣叹了口气。“为什么每个人都问我这个？你们不应该知道吗？”

A quiet came over the man's face. "I suppose I should."  
男人的脸上浮现出一丝静谧。“我想我应该知道。”

They closed on the hills in short order, adorned in bright silver from the vast complex of greenhouses and aquacells. They stood in the face of it for several minutes while Shinji gained his bearings. He had been made to memorize all the emergency routes, entrances and exits – and participated in mandatory evacuation drills like everyone else. The way was easy to find. On the eastern end of the complex, out into the grassy foot hills, an concrete bunker jut out of the landscape. Its walls stretched out across the smooth pavement like arms open in welcome – massive, thick steel doors barring the way in.  
他们很快接近了那片山丘，山丘上点缀着从庞大的温室和水上单元中反射出的银光。他们在山丘前驻足了几分钟，让真嗣辨认方向。他被迫记住了所有紧急路线、入口和出口——并像其他人一样参与了强制性的疏散演习。找到路并不难。在综合体的东端，穿过草地山丘，一个混凝土掩体突兀地矗立在景观中。它的墙壁像张开的双臂一样延伸在平滑的路面上——巨大的、厚重的钢门挡住了入口。

GEOFRONT SHELTER 11 – it read at the top.  
顶部写着：“GEOFRONT 避难所 11”。

Shinji stepped up to a small panel nestled into the wall beside the doors, a camera watching him from above. Sliding his I.D. card, the panel chirped, and a thundering crescendo of clangs sounded as the doors parted.  
真嗣走到门旁嵌入墙内的小控制板前，上方有一台摄像头正对着他。他滑动自己的身份证，控制板发出一声鸣响，随即传来一阵轰鸣的铿锵声，门缓缓分开。

Inside, a pair of N-Sec guards were waiting. An impromptu checkpoint with metal detectors had been set up. Perhaps for any non-essential staff that were requested topside for one thing or another. He could only guess.  
里面，两名 N-Sec 警卫正在等候。一个临时设置的安检点，配备了金属探测器。或许是针对那些因各种原因被要求到地面上来的非必要人员。他只能猜测。

One of them spoke into the radio strapped to his vest, while the other waved them up and down with one of those wands they had at airports.  
其中一人对着固定在背心上的无线电说话，而另一人则挥动着机场常见的那种探测棒，上下扫动着他们。

Clearing them through, Shinji and Kaji boarded one of four escalators that funneled into a wide, dark tunnel, lit only by the tiny lights bouncing off the reflective sides of the escalators. They winked and shimmered as a river splashed with moonlight might.  
安检通过后，真嗣和加持登上四部自动扶梯中的一部，扶梯通向一条宽阔而昏暗的隧道，仅靠扶梯反射面上的微弱灯光照明。这些灯光如同月光下波光粼粼的河水，闪烁着迷人的光芒。

When they walked off at the base, the tunnel opened up to an expanse that was perhaps the size of a stadium, filled as far as he could see with folding cots and bobbing heads. No one there knew the next op was only in a few days. Better to tell them to hunker down for the foreseeable future, just in case they failed again.  
当他们走到隧道底部时，眼前豁然开朗，一个或许有体育场大小的空间展现在眼前，放眼望去，满是折叠床和晃动的人头。那里没有人知道下一次行动就在几天后。为了以防万一再次失败，最好让他们在可预见的未来里继续坚守。

Just in case _he_ failed.  
以防万一他失败了。

Medical personnel patrolled the cots or waited by care stations, and everyone wore filtered masks. A few NERV Security stood by exits and entrances. Wooden partitions had also been erected in rectangular blocks along the walls.  
医护人员在床位间巡逻或在护理站旁待命，所有人都戴着过滤口罩。几名 NERV 保安守在出入口。墙壁上还竖起了木制隔板，呈矩形区块排列。

Shinji paused a moment to take in the sheer amount of people. "I had no idea there were this many civilians in the GeoFront."  
真嗣停顿片刻，环顾四周密集的人群。“我没想到地底都市里有这么多平民。”

Kaji made something of a laugh. "Well, yeah kid, all of that support has to come from somewhere, right?"  
加持发出了一声轻笑。“嗯，没错，孩子，所有的支持总得来自某个地方，对吧？”

Shinji hadn't given that much thought before. Sure, he knew the technicians and the pit crew mechanics, but only because they worked on the same thing he did, just in a different way.  
真嗣之前并没有过多考虑这些。当然，他认识那些技术人员和维修团队，但仅仅是因为他们和他做着同样的工作，只是方式不同。

"What do they look like? The person you're looking for?"  
“他们长什么样？你在找的那个人？”

"Uh, brown hair. Like, really light brown. Almost sienna." He leveled a hand to his shoulder. "It goes down to here. Straight but a little wavy at the ends. Ah... definitely older than thirty, but probably not forty."  
"呃，棕色头发。非常浅的棕色，近乎赭色。" 他用手比划到肩膀。"长度到这里。直发，但发梢有点波浪。啊...肯定超过三十岁，但应该不到四十。"

It took an invasive amount of searching: pausing awkwardly by cots or groupings, stepping into areas they were clearly in the way and probably shouldn't have been. That was how they found her, by one of the water stations attached to a large kitchen like the ones at the food courts along the outer walls. She was wearing the typical workers uniform over her clothes – white apron and bandana. Water boiled on one of the four stoves, next to which sat a glass teapot. From a silver container labeled English Rose, he watched her take spoonfuls of dried leaves and slip them into the filter.  
他们费了好一番周折才找到她：尴尬地停在床铺或人群旁，踏入明显妨碍到别人的区域，本不该出现在那里。最终，他们在连接着大型厨房的水站旁找到了她，那厨房就像外墙边的美食广场一样。她穿着典型的工人制服——白色围裙和头巾。四个炉子中的一个上，水正在沸腾，旁边放着一个玻璃茶壶。他从标有“英式玫瑰”的银色容器中，看到她用勺子舀起干茶叶，放入过滤器中。

"Miss Okinoshima." "冲岛小姐。"

Her hair swayed as she turned, expression placid – but wary. Maybe that wasn't the right word.  
她转身时，发丝轻摆，表情平静却带着警惕。或许那并不是最恰当的词汇。

"Hi there," Kaji said, leaning against the wall and delivering a wink. Okinoshima took him in at a glance before pausing again on Shinji.  
“嗨，你好。”卡吉靠在墙上，眨了眨眼。冲津岛迅速打量了他一眼，随后再次将目光停留在真嗣身上。

Water gurgled on the stove top.  
炉子上的水壶咕噜作响。

"The tea will be ready in five minutes," she said.  
“茶五分钟后就好，”她说。

If it wasn't for the hair, he might not have recognized her at all, since he'd never seen her dressed in anything but dark business attire. Here, she was wearing slim blue jeans that hugged her legs and a pale pink long sleeve shirt. There wasn't any jewelry on her, or any of the other things people donned to make themselves stand out. It reminded him a bit of Rei.  
如果不是因为那头头发，他可能根本认不出她来，因为他从未见过她穿除了深色职业装以外的衣服。此刻，她穿着紧身蓝色牛仔裤，紧紧包裹着双腿，以及一件浅粉色的长袖衬衫。她身上没有任何珠宝，也没有人们用来让自己脱颖而出的其他装饰。这让他想起了丽。

So they stood there and watched the tea turn from gold to pink.  
于是他们站在那里，看着茶水从金色变成粉红色。

Okinoshima filled two cups, looking at him upon pouring the second one.  
冲岛斟满两杯茶，倒第二杯时看了他一眼。

"Plain is fine. I've never had this kind before," he said, and she took both cups in hand.  
“普通的就好。这种我还没喝过，”他说着，她便双手接过两杯茶。

Then, to Kaji she said, "you may help yourself," before leading them out.  
随后，她对梶说：“你可以自便。”然后领着他们走了出去。

Guiding them behind one of the partitions, showers steaming on the other side, she sat in _seiza_ while he just crossed his legs, two cups of tea between them. They made all the kids at school sit that way for special presentations, for good posture or something. On the other side of the walls, someone was between humming and singing... Shinji listened a moment, whispering the words to see if they fit.  
她引导他们来到一个隔间后面，淋浴间的热气在另一侧蒸腾，她以正坐的姿势坐下，而他只是盘腿而坐，两人之间放着两杯茶。学校里的孩子们在特殊演示时都被要求那样坐，为了保持良好姿势或其他什么。隔墙的另一边，有人在哼唱着……真嗣听了一会儿，低声念出歌词，看看是否吻合。

"_And when you smile at me that way, you can warm the coldest day... it's magic..._"  
“当你那样对我微笑时，你能温暖最寒冷的日子……那是魔法……”

"Hm?"

"Magic Ways," he said, "from Tatsuro's album Big Wave. I know a lot of them."  
“《魔法之路》，”他说，“来自达郎的《巨浪》专辑。我熟悉很多他的歌。”

Okinoshima's eyes didn't lift from her cup. "He's married to Mariya Takeuchi."  
冲岛的目光没有从她的杯子上移开。“他和竹内玛莉亚结婚了。”

"Huh? No way." “啊？不可能吧。”

"Nineteen-eighty-two." “一九八二年。”

"Wow." "哇。"

She took a sip and cradled the cup in both hands. Shinji did the same. It was black tea, well-steeped, and richly bitter – but with a sweetness from the rosebuds that made it easy to drink more. Not unlike the olives he'd used to eat as a kid.  
她轻啜一口，双手捧着茶杯。真嗣也照做了。这是红茶，浸泡得恰到好处，浓郁而苦涩——但玫瑰花蕾的甜味让它变得容易入口。和他小时候常吃的橄榄颇为相似。

Okinoshima was staring off into the shelter, where people milled about, resting in their cots, entertaining toddlers, reading, pacing, boring themselves to death with mahjong and cards to keep from being buried in nothing.  
冲永岛目光投向避难所，那里人们四处走动，躺在床上休息，逗弄蹒跚学步的孩子，阅读，踱步，用麻将和纸牌消磨时间，以免被无尽的空虚吞没。

"How is your lotus?" Shinji asked, wishing he could see it. Perhaps he might on the way back, but it seemed wrong to enter the place without her in it. Seeing the flower didn't really mean anything if she wasn't there anyway.  
“你的莲花怎么样了？”真嗣问道，真希望能亲眼看看。或许回程时可以，但总觉得没有她在场，进入那个地方似乎不太对。毕竟，没有她在，看到那朵花也毫无意义。

"I think the container you have it in is too small," he went on. That, or she wasn't giving it enough fertilizer. Sunlight wasn't an issue. Really, the only thing he could imagine was that the bowl was too tiny. Flowers like that wanted to spread out and be seen.  
"我觉得你放它的容器太小了，"他继续说道。要么就是肥料给得不够。阳光倒不是问题。真的，他唯一能想到的就是碗太窄了。那种花喜欢伸展开放，引人注目。

Okinoshima didn't respond, occupied by the NERV non-essentials and the tea in her hands. Shinji followed her gaze again, seeing if he could home in on what she was seeing. They all just became a blur of movement and noise, and he ended up staring into his tea.  
冲岛没有回应，忙于处理 NERV 的非紧急事务和手中的茶。真嗣再次跟随她的目光，试图找出她在看什么。周围的一切都变成了一片模糊的移动和噪音，他最终只是盯着茶杯发呆。

"I'm worried," he said, watching thin bits of leaves swirl, "about the operation we're going to be doing to kill the Angel. I've been given a really important position."  
"我很担心，"他看着细小的叶片旋转，说道，"关于我们要执行的消灭使徒的行动。我被赋予了一个非常重要的职位。"

The tea was warm and he took another sip, holding it closer. "I'm not really sure I can do it. Asuka doesn't even think I can do it."  
茶温热着，他又啜了一口，更紧地握住杯子。“我不太确定自己能做到。明日香甚至认为我做不到。”

Even though she hadn't come out and said it, he knew it was what she was thinking. Why else would she want it? Bright white eyes from a shadow saw him. He shook his head, dispelling the image. "I can't even kill the wolf in my nightmares."  
尽管她没有明说，但他知道这就是她的想法。否则她为何会想要呢？从阴影中投来的明亮白眼注视着他。他摇摇头，驱散了那影像。“我甚至无法杀死梦魇中的那头狼。”

"What could you do about that?"  
“你又能对此做些什么呢？”

Shinji blinked. Then looked up. Okinoshima's eyes were still out in the shelter, away from him.  
真嗣眨了眨眼。然后抬头望去。冲野岛的目光依旧停留在避难所的远处，没有看向他。

"What?" "什么？"

"The wolf," she said, facing him again, her head falling in a slight tilt. "What could you do?"  
“那只狼，”她再次面对他，头微微倾斜，说道，“你能做什么呢？”

"Well, I can't... can I? It's just a dream."  
“嗯，我不能……我能吗？这只是一个梦。”

Okinoshima took a sip from her cup, tantamount to a shrug. "Then it is just a dream, and you are powerless."  
冲岛啜了一口杯中的茶，这动作无异于耸了耸肩。“那么，这只是一个梦，你无能为力。”

They sat a while longer with their tea. The person in the showers was still singing _Magic_, and other than the murmur of the shelter, all else was quiet between them. She'd never spoken to him like that before. Or at all, really. He didn't know what else to do besides leave. Shinji thanked her for the tea, leaving his cup there as he stood.  
他们又坐了一会儿，品着茶。淋浴间里的人还在唱着《Magic》，除了庇护所的低语声，两人之间一片静谧。她从未这样和他说过话。或者说，根本就没怎么说过话。除了离开，他不知道还能做什么。真嗣向她道谢，感谢她的茶，留下杯子站起身来。

Okinoshima stared at it and said nothing more.  
冲岛盯着杯子，再没多言。

Walking back into the water station, he found Kaji side by side with a woman in front of the stove, also taking the opportunity to make tea. The former was leaning in rather close and speaking softly through a grin, while the latter wore a blush and had a hand up to cover giggles.  
走回供水站，他发现卡吉正和一个女人并肩站在炉子前，也趁机泡茶。前者靠得相当近，带着微笑轻声细语，而后者则面带红晕，一手掩嘴轻笑。

"I'm leaving," Shinji said, making the woman jump, and walking away before either could say anything. Kaji called after him a few times, before catching up at the escalators. They boarded and rode up through the dim-lit tunnel without a word.  
“我要走了。”真嗣说道，让那女人吓了一跳，然后不等他们回应就径自离开。卡吉在后面喊了他几次，随后在电梯前追上了他。他们上了电梯，在昏暗的隧道中默默上升。

Once topside and out in open air again, they saw the day had quieted to afternoon. Waves crashed through the grass, crickets chirping. They took the dirt maintenance road back to Headquarters. When they reached Kaji's watermelon patches, their paths parted, though the man turned while stepping downhill.  
一回到地面，再次呼吸到新鲜空气时，他们发现白天已悄然转为午后。海浪穿过草地，蟋蟀鸣叫。他们沿着泥土维护道路返回总部。当他们到达卡吉的西瓜地时，两人分道扬镳，尽管卡吉在下坡时转身回望。

"Well, Shinji, it's been fun. Let's do it again sometime," he said, ever smiling.  
"好吧，真嗣，这很有趣。我们改天再一起玩吧，"他总是面带微笑地说。

"Yeah. Thanks," he said, and actually meant it, no less suspicious of the man.  
"嗯，谢谢，"他说，这次是真心实意的，对那人的怀疑也少了几分。

His smile softened as some severity came to him. "You should probably check your phone while you're at it."  
他的笑容柔和了几分，语气中带着些许严肃。“你或许该顺便检查一下手机。”

Kaji's back faced him as he returned to his melons, and Shinji decided he would check his cell after all. It'd been a few hours. His phone began to chirp and buzz with missed calls and messages. All of them from Asuka.  
加持背对着他回到瓜果旁，真嗣决定还是检查一下手机。已经过去几个小时了。他的手机开始响起，震动，满是未接来电和信息。全都是来自明日香的。

"Seriously... who does that?"  
“说真的……谁会那样做？”

Still, on the way home, Shinji erred on the side of picking up two cokes from a vending machine. Taking the offering, Asuka stretched out on the futon in front of the TV, leaving him on the carpet.  
尽管如此，在回家的路上，真嗣还是决定从自动贩卖机里买了两罐可乐。接过可乐，明日香伸展身体躺在电视前的被褥上，留下他在地毯上。

Later, he was given the gracious duty of brushing her hair.  
后来，他被赋予了为她梳发的荣幸职责。

She didn't bring up the operation again.  
她再也没有提起过那次手术。

---

It had taken Asuka a few days to get used to the penguin.  
明日香花了几天时间才适应了那只企鹅。

A dog or a cat might have been understandable, but maybe Misato was the only person in the world who would think a penguin, _genetically altered_, made an appropriate pet. The thing reeked of fish, which made sense, and she supposed smelled no worse than a wet dog.  
一只狗或猫或许还能理解，但或许 Misato 是世界上唯一一个会认为经过基因改造的企鹅是合适宠物的人。那家伙浑身散发着鱼腥味，这也合乎情理，她觉得它闻起来并不比湿漉漉的狗更糟糕。

Still, it took a while before she got used to her shins bumping into him around every corner. PenPen seemed to take pleasure in being near or around their feet when he wasn't asleep in his fridge. So much so that Shinji had to take him in one arm and carry him around like a baby, which she suspected is what he actually wanted. Asuka couldn't bring herself to hold him yet. Her skin crawled every time she even thought about it.  
尽管如此，她花了好一阵子才习惯在每个转角小腿撞到他。PenPen 似乎很享受在他们脚边或周围转悠，除非他在冰箱里睡觉。以至于 Shinji 不得不单手抱起他，像抱婴儿一样带着他四处走，她怀疑这正是他真正想要的。Asuka 还无法让自己抱起他。每次只要想到这个，她的皮肤就感到一阵发麻。

Most days at the apartment were uneventful, which drove her mad – which meant she drove Shinji mad.  
公寓里的大多数日子都平淡无奇，这让她发疯——这意味着她让 Shinji 也发疯了。

She wanted to drag him down to Headquarters when it became particularly still. To spar, to swim, to move around – to see anything other than the plain carpet and kitchen and drapes. Except she never hounded him on it, only thought of doing it, which built this wall of thrumming anxiety in her. Because he'd become... _weird_ since a few days ago.  
她想在特别安静的时候把他拽到总部去。去练习，去游泳，去活动——去看除了单调的地毯、厨房和窗帘以外的东西。但她从未真正催促过他，只是想过这么做，这在她心中筑起了一堵颤动的焦虑之墙。因为自从几天前开始，他就变得……怪怪的。

She'd come out of the shower, freshly changed: a slim yellow shirt and short-shorts. Comfortable. When he'd turned around, maybe to ask her something, his mouth clamped shut – and his eyes moved down, then up, pausing, until he fell right onto her stare. That didn't last more than a breath before he got up and said he had to take out the trash.  
她洗完澡，刚换上衣服：一件修身的黄色衬衫和短裤。舒适自在。当他转过身来，也许是想问她什么，嘴巴却突然闭上了——他的目光向下，然后向上移动，停顿了一下，直到他直直地迎上了她的目光。这不过持续了一瞬间，他就起身说他得去倒垃圾。

In the dead echo he left behind, filled by a wash of sounds from the TV, all she could think to do was go to his room and snatch his SDAT for herself. It didn't feel the same being in there, as though she were an unnatural, even unwelcome presence. So she laid down in Misato's, listening to the music, her head poking out onto the living room carpet from the doorway.  
在他留下的死寂回声中，充斥着电视的嘈杂声，她唯一能想到的就是去他的房间拿走他的 SDAT 自己听。在那里感觉不一样，仿佛她是一个不自然甚至不受欢迎的存在。于是她躺在美里的房间里，听着音乐，头从门口探出来，伸到客厅的地毯上。

There, she decided it wasn't a normal glance at her. This was different. It was the kind of look all boys just sort of had, that she'd first noticed at university and saw every day now at school – whether it was catching their eyes on her in the halls or watching them leer at a gaggle of girls during track.  
在那里，她意识到这不是一次寻常的瞥视。这不一样。这是所有男孩似乎都有的那种眼神，她最初在大学时注意到，现在每天在学校都能见到——无论是在走廊上捕捉到他们的目光，还是在田径场上看到他们对一群女孩投以淫笑。

Shinji had looked at her like she was a real girl.  
真嗣看她的眼神，仿佛她是一个真正的女孩。

That moment, though small, maybe insignificant her mind said, crept over her at odd hours of the day. While they were sitting together on the futon, she might notice how close they were, how their knees sometimes touched. Or his proximity to her in the kitchen when she helped him prepare a meal for the night. In her space. Invading her senses.  
那一刻，尽管微小，或许在她心中显得无足轻重，却总是在不经意间掠过她的心头。当他们一起坐在蒲团上时，她可能会注意到他们靠得有多近，他们的膝盖有时会触碰。或者在厨房里她帮他准备晚餐时，他离她有多近。侵入她的空间。侵扰她的感官。

Two days before the operation – Misato canceled the standby order for the pilots. No one explained why, but Asuka knew it was probably just someone higher up complaining about money. That's all adults ever complained about.  
行动前两天——美里取消了驾驶员的待命指令。没人解释原因，但明日香猜想大概只是某个高层在抱怨经费问题。成年人总是抱怨这些。

So Asuka was left to figure out how the hell to entertain herself until the operation, an endeavor in which Shinji was absolutely useless. Mostly, she monopolized the TV.  
于是明日香只能自己想办法打发时间，直到行动开始，而真嗣在这方面完全帮不上忙。她大部分时间都霸占着电视。

Then he would invite Zero over. Or she would just show up. Asuka couldn't tell which. Maybe she'd already been coming over while Asuka had been on her shifts. The result was the same either way – _that_ girl was there. Then Shinji would put on these old black and white American films with bad dubs. Zero, her legs crossed on the futon with PenPen in her lap, became absorbed in the movies, but without any real expression. It just looked more intent, like when they'd buried the dog. Except for the moments she would smile. Shinji would smile.  
然后他会邀请绫波过来。或者她自己出现。明日香分不清是哪种情况。也许在她值班的时候绫波就已经来过了。结果都一样——那个女孩就在那里。接着真嗣会放一些老旧的黑白美国电影，配音很糟糕。绫波双腿交叉坐在蒲团上，怀里抱着 PenPen，全神贯注地看电影，但脸上没有任何表情。只是看起来更专注，就像他们埋葬那只狗时一样。除了她偶尔微笑的时刻。真嗣也会微笑。

In those moments they looked as comfortable and at ease as...  
在那些时刻，他们看起来就像……一样舒适自在。

Asuka made a show of exiling herself to the balcony, with chips, sweets, and maybe a beer to try and drink while reading a stack of his comics. Out in a dark city with no one in it, light from elsewhere reflecting off the Angel's gently swaying form high above.  
明日香装模作样地把自己流放到阳台上，带着薯片、糖果，或许还有一瓶啤酒，边读着他的一堆漫画边尝试着喝。在空无一人的黑暗城市中，来自别处的光线映照在天使高耸、轻轻摇曳的身姿上。

It went like that for hours, and not once did he even knock on the sliding door to check on her. Or peek his head out and ask what she was doing or send her a text. Not a word!  
这种情况持续了几个小时，他一次也没有敲过滑动门去查看她的情况。也没有探出头来问她在做什么，或者发条短信给她。一个字都没有！

When Zero eventually left, either to Headquarters or for something else, Asuka wouldn't look at him, wouldn't speak to him, or acknowledge him in the slightest. Until he did something so ridiculous, she couldn't help but laugh. Like when she'd found him just standing in the kitchen with a huge pot swallowing his head, waiting for her to walk in. He was so stupid, and annoying, and an asshole.  
当零最终离开，无论是去总部还是其他地方，明日香都不会看他一眼，不会和他说话，也不会对他有丝毫的回应。直到他做了些如此荒谬的事，她忍不住笑出声来。比如她发现他只是站在厨房里，一个大锅罩住了他的头，等着她走进来。他真是愚蠢、烦人，还是个混蛋。

But it made it impossible for her to stay angry after that, much as she tried. And he knew it. She knew he knew it. Like it was one of their bets. 'I bet I can make you stop being mad at me'.  
但这让她在那之后无法再保持愤怒，尽管她努力尝试。而他知道这一点。她知道他知道这一点。就像这是他们之间的赌注之一。'我打赌我能让你不再生我的气'。

Those weren't bets she could win. At least, not the other way around. She couldn't make him laugh like that. Why should she have to anyway? What the hell did he have to be so mad at her for? For being honest about certain things? For getting him to do anything besides sit around and be boring?  
那些不是她能赢的赌注。至少，不是反过来。她无法让他那样笑。她为什么要这么做呢？他到底有什么理由对她发火？是因为她对某些事情诚实吗？还是因为她让他除了坐着无所事事之外做了其他事情？

She could win, if she really wanted, but it would mean they wouldn't talk again. That's what winning meant. Some days she thought that might not be so bad. All Shinji did was drag his feet when she was around, as though she were a weight clamped to his ankles.  
如果她真心想赢，她能赢，但这意味着他们不会再有交谈。这就是胜利的代价。有些日子她觉得这或许也没那么糟糕。每当她在身边，真嗣总是拖着脚步，仿佛她的存在是夹在他脚踝上的重负。

Just thinking it set her in an ugly mood.  
光是这么想就让她心情恶劣。

Really, it just made her feel stuck, like in Bernau those last two weeks she'd been getting ready to go to college. She would finally be able to live on her own, in a way. Be free of her father and step-mother. Of the dresses and dark curtains and high walls.  
真的，这让她感觉被困住了，就像在伯尔瑙准备去大学的那最后两周。她终于能够以某种方式独立生活，摆脱父亲和继母的束缚，摆脱那些裙子、深色窗帘和高墙。

She would be free. 她将会自由。

What she didn't know was that she'd be left behind. No, that wasn't right. She did know that, and that's why she left the way she did. Was that so wrong?  
她不知道的是，她会被留下。不，这样说并不准确。她确实知道这一点，而这正是她选择离开的原因。这样做错了吗？

It hadn't quite felt that way, not enough to be real, until the Christmas she'd come back home.  
直到她回家过圣诞节的那一年，那种感觉才变得真实起来，不再只是模糊的感受。

Walking the gardens had kind of been like stepping back in time – or the closest thing to it. She hadn't been gone that long, though it could've been years if she didn't know any better. The place was hardly recognizable and finding her way took the better part of a day. Most of the flowers had died, overgrown by wild ferns and greedy vines. The birches had rotted away, their grove nothing but broken pillars of mold-ridden wood standing like grave markers.  
漫步于花园中，仿佛穿越了时空——或者说是与之最为接近的体验。虽然她离开的时间并不长，但若不细想，可能会以为已过去数年。这个地方几乎无法辨认，她花了大半天时间才找到路。大部分花朵已经凋零，被野生的蕨类和贪婪的藤蔓所覆盖。白桦树也已腐朽，它们的小树林只剩下霉烂的木柱，宛如墓碑般矗立。

Though it took some time, she found it at last – their old olive tree, encased in a thicket of thorns. She'd discovered something else out there with it. A red sash she'd given him once, left tied to an arm of the tree.  
尽管费了些功夫，她最终还是找到了——他们那棵老橄榄树，被一丛荆棘包围。她在那里还发现了别的东西。一条她曾赠予他的红色丝带，依旧系在树枝上。

Asuka still had some of the scars on her legs from the many cuts that'd ripped through her skin getting to it. Thick rivulets of red dripping down to her toes. The dress had been ruined too. Stepmother insisted she dress like a lady when visiting. It took some climbing, the thorns nipping at her all the way up, until she was able to untie the sash. Exhausted, she sat in the crook of the olive tree's wide trunk, clutching it tight and resting her temple against the sandpaper bark. Next to her was the spot she had carved her name years back, in kanji too, just so Shinji could know for sure that it was hers. She'd made him teach her the characters of her name. "Tomorrow" and "Fragrance". Even the memory couldn't make her smile.  
明日香腿上还留有一些疤痕，那是她一路攀爬时，荆棘划破皮肤留下的。鲜红的血流顺着小腿滴落到脚尖。那条裙子也毁了。继母坚持她在拜访时必须打扮得像个淑女。她费力地攀爬，一路上荆棘不断刺痛她，直到她终于解开了腰带。筋疲力尽的她坐在橄榄树宽大的树干凹陷处，紧紧抱着树干，将额头靠在粗糙的树皮上休息。旁边是她多年前刻下的名字，用的是汉字，只为让真嗣确信那是她的名字。她让他教她名字的汉字写法，“明日”和“香”。即便如此，回忆也无法让她露出笑容。

Was she really so awful?  
她真的那么糟糕吗？

She lay on her bed in the dark of her room that night, holding the red sash to her chest. His half-formed shadow, etched in charcoal, sat on the wall beside her.  
那晚，她躺在黑暗的房间里，将红腰带紧贴在胸前。他那用炭笔勾勒的半成形影子，静静地挂在墙边。

His shadow was there now, right in front of her. On the other side of the cloudy plastic sheets drawn to split the locker room nestled just beyond the Cages. She watched him. Today was mission day. They would be going out to kill the Eighth Angel.  
他的身影此刻就在她面前，就在那层用来隔开更衣室的云纹塑料布的另一边，更衣室紧挨着笼区。她注视着他。今天是任务日，他们将要外出消灭第八使徒。

Asuka still wanted to ask him. But she couldn't figure out if he was ignoring her, like he always did. Either that or he didn't remember. She'd been sitting in the aching silence after...  
明日香仍想问他。但她无法确定他是否在故意忽视她，就像他一贯所做的那样。要么就是他忘记了。她一直坐在那令人痛苦的沉默之后……

"_Hey... Shinji?"_ “嘿……真嗣？”

A band of hurt wrapped around her and squeezed. Asuka couldn't fathom what had possessed her to even voice it.  
一阵痛楚环绕着她，紧紧挤压。明日香无法理解自己为何会说出那番话。

His silhouette became fainter on the other side as he drew further away. Asuka knew she was falling behind, because she was standing there like a dunce, and he would make it out to the cages first. She didn't care about that right then, clutching her plugsuit. Zero had changed and prepared long before they arrived. It was just the two of them. Her eyes found the duffel bag sitting in her locker.  
他的身影在对岸逐渐模糊，随着他越走越远。明日香知道自己在落后，因为她像个傻瓜一样站在那里，而他将率先到达笼子。她当时并不在乎这些，紧抓着自己的驾驶服。零早已在他们到达之前就换好并准备好了。只有他们两个人。她的目光落在了储物柜里的旅行袋上。

"Hey, Shinji." “嘿，真嗣。”

The squirming and creaking of plastic stopped. A wave of heat bowled into her, constricting. She frowned.  
塑料的扭动和吱嘎声停止了。一股热浪扑面而来，紧紧束缚着她。她皱起了眉头。

"Yeah, Asuka?" "嗯，明日香？"

God, what was wrong with her?  
天啊，她怎么了？

"Nevermind." "算了。"

Donning her plugsuit became more of a chore than usual as she shoved her legs and arms into their sleeves with clumsy force. The door to the boy's half of the room squealed as he left, while she was still struggling to get her right foot all the way in. Tiny pockets of fire burst in her chest. She cursed and struck her leg out, foot slamming into a locker face. It did little more than leave her unbalanced and she fell hard on her rear.  
穿上她的插头服变得比平时更像是一项苦差事，她笨拙地用力将腿和胳膊塞进袖子里。当男孩离开房间的另一半时，门发出了刺耳的声音，而她还在挣扎着把右脚完全伸进去。胸口的小火苗突然爆发。她咒骂着，猛地踢出腿，脚重重地撞在储物柜上。这几乎没有让她失去平衡，她重重地摔在了屁股上。

Asuka set her hands flat against the cold floor and eased herself onto her back. One deep breath through her nose, then two. A third. It was the one thing she had taken away from the counselor at university, out of the few scheduled visits she'd actually attended. An exercise that was seeing more and more use as the days went by. Perhaps most after the battle with the Seventh Angel.  
明日香将双手平放在冰冷的地板上，缓缓躺下。深深地用鼻子吸了一口气，然后是两口。第三口。这是她从大学里的辅导员那里学到的一件事，尽管她实际上参加的预约并不多。随着时间的推移，这项练习的使用越来越频繁。也许在与第七使徒的战斗之后，使用得最多。

A week spent drenched in the floods of her own pitiful performance. Everyone at school asking her about Shinji, and lying through her teeth to all of them. Because how could she admit to anyone that the Angel had swallowed him whole and there had been nothing she could do to stop it? _Not a thing_. She was a pilot of the most advanced weapon system mankind had ever developed, and she couldn't even handle _that_. For all the difference it had made.  
一周的时间沉浸在自己可怜表现的洪流中。学校里的每个人都在问她关于真嗣的事，她却对他们撒了谎。因为她怎么能向任何人承认，使徒将他整个吞噬，而她却无能为力？什么也做不了。她是人类开发的最先进武器系统的驾驶员，却连这都处理不好。这一切又有何意义。

Even now, remembering that knocked the wind out of her.  
即便现在，回想起那一刻仍让她感到窒息。

"Come on, Asuka." “加油，明日香。”

She took her time, inching into every nook and cranny of the suit before toggling the vacuum seal. By then she was standing again, facing down her duffel bag once more.  
她不慌不忙，慢慢探索着驾驶服的每一个角落，然后才启动了真空密封。此时她再次站起身，再次面对着自己的行李袋。

A decision then. 那么，做个决定吧。

Entering the Cages, sharp smells of oil and grease welcomed her. The restraining walls for the Evas hadn't yet been peeled away. She checked the watch nestled into her suit. Still ten minutes before they had to be plug-ready. Asuka gripped the fabric in her left hand a little tighter and found the grated stairwell to Unit-01's plug dock. Shinji didn't notice her come up, leaning forward on the railing and staring hard at the Test Type's face plating. Even though she couldn't hear his thoughts, she could see them etched in the creases of his expression.  
进入拘束室，机油和润滑油的刺鼻气味迎面扑来。用于固定 EVA 的墙壁还未被拆除。她检查了嵌在驾驶服里的手表，还有十分钟才到必须连接电源的时间。明日香左手紧握着衣服，找到了通往零号机插头对接口的格栅楼梯。真嗣没有注意到她的到来，他身体前倾靠在栏杆上，凝视着试验型 EVA 的面板。尽管听不见他的心声，但她能从他表情的皱褶中看出他的思绪。

"You think too much," she said, though he didn't jump as his head swiveled 'round to her.  
"你想太多了，" 她说，尽管他的头转动时并没有跳起来。

"About what?" "关于什么？"

She made a face at that, catching his lie. Then he spotted the fold of red in her hand, almost blending in with her suit. Eyes alight with recognition, his lips parted.  
她对此做了个鬼脸，识破了他的谎言。然后他注意到她手中那一抹红色，几乎与她的西装融为一体。眼中闪过一丝认出之色，他的嘴唇微微张开。

"I know it's stupid," she snapped. The last thing she wanted was for him to talk today. "Just let me do it, okay?"  
"我知道这很蠢，" 她厉声道。她最不希望的就是他今天开口说话。"就让我这么做，好吗？"

Really, it wasn't a request since she'd already stepped up to his right side, unfurling the sash – frayed at the edges, while its bright apple red had faded to burgundy. Shinji watched her hands wrap it around and tie it off.  
真的，这不算请求，因为她已经走到他的右边，展开了那条边缘磨损、原本鲜亮的苹果红已褪成酒红色的腰带。真嗣看着她的手将其环绕并系紧。

Thankfully, her disposition was enough to convince him to keep his obnoxious mouth shut. At least he wasn't a complete idiot some of the time.  
幸好，她的态度足以说服他闭上那张讨厌的嘴。至少他不是一直那么愚蠢。

She spent the last five minutes before Op leaning on the railing next to him. All too soon, the timer on her watch started beeping, signaling her departure. Asuka sensed him hesitate as she broke away.  
在 Op 开始前的最后五分钟，她靠在他旁边的栏杆上。很快，她手表上的计时器开始发出哔哔声，提醒她该离开了。明日香感觉到她在离开时他犹豫了一下。

"Don't lose it this time," she said, descending to meet her Unit-02 – patiently awaiting her arrival.  
"这次别再丢了，"她边说边降下去与她的二号机汇合——耐心等待着她的到来。

---

**The Second Attempt 第二次尝试**

---

Rei and Asuka launched ahead of him by just a few minutes – enough that the Angel wouldn't attack him outright once he arrived topside. Not if they were in its field of awareness first. All they had to do was delay the target until the railgun was ready. The weapon itself was waiting in position on the slopes of Mount Mikuni, with Unit-01 being taken there via catapult line.  
丽和明日香比他早几分钟出发——足以确保天使在他到达地面时不会直接攻击他。只要她们先进入天使的感知范围。他们所要做的就是拖延目标，直到电磁炮准备就绪。武器本身已经就位在御来峰山的斜坡上，零号机正通过弹射线被送往那里。

Floating in the LCL beside him was the red sash. It couldn't have been the same one.  
漂浮在他身旁的 LCL 中的是那条红色腰带。不可能是同一条。

The route from launch bay to mountainside was longer than the main lines, having to detour up and under the range rimming the caldera. It was just enough time, shooting through the lighted tunnel, to think of Misato standing by his entry plug in the cages. Just before they'd been called to man their entry plugs.  
从发射舱到山腰的路径比主线更长，需要绕道上行并穿过环形火山口的群山。这段穿越光亮隧道的时光，刚好足够他想起站在他插入栓笼旁的美里。就在他们被召唤进入插入栓之前。

_She'd come along the restraining wall, pausing a few more steps before she would have met the platform. He watched her, not knowing what to say, if there was anything he should have said. A minor detail to brief him about? She could have done that through the Battle Circuit.  
她沿着约束墙走来，在即将到达平台前停了几步。他注视着她，不知道该说什么，或者是否有话应该说。一个需要简要告知他的小细节？她本可以通过战斗电路传达的。_

_His CO, his guardian, hung onto the guard rail, lingering on a thought. He saw it stuck behind her lips.  
他的指挥官，他的守护者，紧抓着护栏，沉浸在某个思绪中。他看见那念头卡在她的唇边。_

"_Take us home, Shinji," she said, giving him a smile he had learned to tell wasn't real. Hanging over the front half of the plug, Shinji in turn gave her a thumbs up he didn't feel, before dropping into the command chair._  
“带我们回家，真嗣，”她说，给了他一个他已学会辨认并非真心的微笑。真嗣悬在前半部分的插入栓上，反过来给了她一个他并不真心的大拇指，然后落入指挥椅。

A clearance marker beeped from the command console. Sixty seconds to arrival.  
指挥台上的清关标志发出哔哔声。六十秒后抵达。

Ritsuko appeared on his left. _"It's just like we went over in the mission packet: you have to wait until the MAGI confirm the Exclusion Zone is gone and the Angel's field is cleared – otherwise the shot won't make it through."_  
律子出现在他的左侧。“就像我们在任务简报中讨论的那样：你必须等到 MAGI 确认隔离区消失，使徒的力场被清除——否则射击无法穿透。”

"Understood." “明白了。”

She nodded and her image winked out.  
她点了点头，影像随即消失。

Unit-01 eased to a halt at the open shutter beneath Mount Mikuni. The inversion crept over the caldera as he did, and on the other side of the lake Tokyo-3 stood in the blood colored light, his plug-HUD locking onto Unit-00 and 02's IFF.  
初号机在御岳山下的开放式闸门处缓缓停下。当他这样做时，逆温现象逐渐覆盖了火山口，而在湖的另一边，东京-3 市在血红色的光芒中矗立，他的插入栓 HUD 锁定了零号机和二号机的 IFF 信号。

Modified with an umbilical cable hookup was the railgun, sitting on a platform that had extended from the catapult line and flattened. From the tunnel entry, he took the plug waiting for Unit-01 and jacked in. A wash of green flowed over his power gauge.  
经过脐带电缆连接改造的电磁炮，安置在一个从弹射线延伸出来并已铺平的平台上。他从隧道入口处拿起等待着初号机的插头，接入其中。一道绿色光芒涌过他的能量指示器。

Shinji took up a firing position, his onboard computer connecting to the railgun to monitor energy flow. Sweeping back to reality, the inversion drained and the battle in the city began again. Towering over everything below was the Angel, the largest he'd ever faced.  
真嗣进入射击位置，他的机载电脑与电磁炮连接，监控能量流动。意识回溯至现实，倒置感消退，城市中的战斗再次展开。天使耸立于一切之上，是他迄今为止面对过的最大的敌人。

"Unit-one, in position, ready to fire."  
“初号机，已就位，准备发射。”

"_Roger, wait for the MAGI's signal. Unit-zero and two will be moving into position."_  
“罗杰，等待 MAGI 的信号。零号机和二号机将进入位置。”

As Maya spoke, an optical assist headset deployed from the rear of the command chair and settled over his head, its visor snapping to life. Contained in a yellow box in the left corner, the word -_STANDBY_- sprang up. Shinji watched it, not even daring to blink. A reticle flashed as it lined up over the Angel's core, maintaining tracking even as the inversion folded. It would be on the next wave. His hands flexed around the induction levers. Then they stilled, he let his shoulders fall, trying to force his nerves to calm.  
当摩耶说话时，指挥椅后部展开了一个光学辅助头盔，稳稳地戴在他的头上，面罩随即亮起。左上角黄色框内，“待命”一词跃然而出。真嗣盯着它，连眨眼都不敢。瞄准线闪烁着对准了使徒的核心，即使在反转折叠中也能保持追踪。下一波攻击即将到来。他的手紧握着感应杆。然后它们静止了，他放松肩膀，试图平复紧张的神经。

Unit-00 and 02's markers had come into proximity. They were fighting off an onslaught of the Angel's tendrils.  
零号机和二号机的标记已经接近。他们正在抵御使徒触手的猛攻。

Any moment now. 随时都可能发生。

A shrill scream. 一声尖锐的尖叫。

_-FIRE- -着火-_

Instantaneous and all at once – a blast split open the left side casing as its armature plowed out of the barrel, black smoke spilling from internal fires. Shinji's shot was shaken off its firing track, the projectile sinking just shy of the core as the inversion gap closed.  
瞬间同时发生——一股冲击力撕裂了左侧外壳，其电枢从枪管中冲出，内部火焰喷涌出黑烟。真嗣的射击偏离了轨道，弹丸在核心边缘停下，反转间隙随即闭合。

"_Damage readings – we just lost a third of our capacitor banks."_  
“损伤读数——我们刚刚损失了三分之一的电容库。”

"_Rail integrity down by thirty-four percent!"_  
“轨道完整性下降了百分之三十四！”

A crescendo of alerts pined for his attention. With a decisive thought, he silenced them.  
一连串的警报声急切地寻求他的注意。他果断地一个念头，便将它们全部静音。

_Shit._

Below, the round had burrowed a deep crater at the crest of the mountains, shattering windows and collapsing some of the weaker structures with its impact. A third of the capacitors gone–  
下方，那圆球在山巅撞击出一个深坑，震碎了窗户，并导致一些较为脆弱的建筑结构崩塌。三分之一的电容器就此损毁——

"Misato," he said, heart trying to rise and envelope his throat, "how much slack does this cable have?"  
“美里，”他问道，心跳试图跃起并扼住他的喉咙，“这根电缆有多大的余量？”

It was Yamazaki that answered. _"Not enough for your next shot to make it in time!"_  
回答的是山崎。“不够你下一枪及时命中！”

Aoba spoke next. _"I've marked the nearest umbilical line. Captain?"_  
接下来是青叶发言。“我已经标记了最近的脐带线路。队长？”

"_Do it."_ “执行吧。”

Shinji jettisoned Unit-01's cord and then the railgun's. Once cleared, he maneuvered the Eva down range along Lake Ashi's western edge, attentive not to let the excessive weight of the gun tip him over. The auto-loader clanked as another armature was primed between the rails. At least it hadn't jammed.  
真嗣切断了初号机的电缆和电磁炮的连接。一旦清理完毕，他便操纵着 Eva 沿着芦之湖的西岸向前推进，小心翼翼地不让电磁炮的过重重量使他失去平衡。自动装弹机咔嚓作响，另一枚弹丸在轨道间准备就绪。至少它没有卡住。

Misato updated Rei and Asuka. The red armband jittered with the external tremors of his movement shivering through the LCL.  
美里向丽和明日香更新了情况。红色臂章随着他动作通过 LCL 传导的外部震动而微微颤动。

A cascade of weapons fire turned the Angel's ribbons away once more.  
一阵密集的武器射击再次将使徒的触须逼退。

Unit-01 reached the outer blocks of Tokyo-3 and Shinji took the waiting plug from its port. A glance at his battery timer – _4:10_. There wasn't time for him to jack-in from another location. He'd wasted enough botching the first shot. If it got down to a minute, he could just use the railgun's umbilical. If he had to do that, they'd be in bad shape anyway, because it meant he would've missed the second shot.  
零一号机抵达了第三新东京市的外围区域，真嗣从接口处取下了等待中的插头。他瞥了一眼电池计时器——4:10。他没有时间从其他位置接入。第一次射击他已经浪费了太多时间。如果时间降到一分钟，他只能使用轨道炮的脐带。如果他不得不这样做，那么情况已经很糟糕了，因为这意味着他错过了第二次射击。

Shinji took up a firing position yet again while they waited for the inversion to fade. Except the sky dropped almost as soon as it had been erected, the Angel's massive form lording above them. A silver streak lanced for him. Unit-01 turned, hauling the railgun out of the way. The Angel's ribbon crashed into a stack of buildings, mere feet away from cleaving the Eva in two.  
真嗣再次占据了射击位置，等待反转效果消退。然而天空几乎刚形成就坍塌了，使徒庞大的身躯凌驾于他们之上。一道银光向他疾驰而来。零一号机转身，拖动轨道炮避开。使徒的缎带撞击在一堆建筑物上，距离将 Eva 一分为二仅差几英尺。

As the face of its ribbon twisted for him – the tip of a spear pierced through. Pulling by the flat of the blade, Unit-02 hauled the end of the ribbon off its line of attack. Then she twisted and shoved the haft upward, letting the prog-spear slice its way free.  
当缎带的面孔向他扭曲时——矛尖穿透了它。零二号机沿着刀刃的平面拉动，将缎带的末端从攻击路线上拉开。然后她扭转并向上推杆，让推进矛自行切开并脱离。

The tendril withdrew and the discolored reflection returned.  
触手缩回，失真的倒影重新显现。

Asuka moved Unit-02 down the road, enough so that his line of sight was clear. Rei came in alongside her down an adjacent street corridor. Their A.T. fields were already unfurled, waiting to be forced outward again. The Field sickness rolled through his stomach as he felt their erratic pulses, haggard from the last push.  
明日香操控着二号机沿路下行，确保视线清晰。绫波则与她并肩，从相邻的街道走廊进入。他们的 A.T.力场已经展开，随时准备再次向外扩张。力场病在他的胃里翻腾，他能感受到他们因上一次冲击而紊乱疲惫的脉搏。

Shaking it off by feeding his field out a little, Shinji took a kneeling position with Unit-01 and let the optical assist headset roll over his head once more. All sensors live, the computer locking onto its target through the illusion. The yellow box appeared.  
通过稍稍释放自己的力场来摆脱不适，真嗣让初号机跪下，再次戴上光学辅助头盔。所有传感器启动，计算机透过幻象锁定目标。黄色方框出现了。

_-STANDBY- -待机-_

His eyes darted from reading to reading, checking for some error he might have missed last time. Rail temperature was still high. With the blast from the overloaded capacitors, some of the heat exchangers had been torn to shreds. Nothing he could do about that. Even now, black smoke leaked from the gun's frame.  
他的目光在读数间来回扫视，检查是否有上次遗漏的错误。轨道温度依旧居高不下。由于过载电容器的爆炸，一些热交换器已被撕成碎片。对此他无能为力。即便此刻，黑烟仍从枪械框架中渗出。

What happened next was too fast.  
接下来发生的一切快得让人目不暇接。

The sky dropped. Only one of the Angel's ribbons flew towards them – and then it split. Like a stream of missiles, each streaking for their own targets. Three strands went for Asuka, one piercing her right arm before she even had time to react. Unit-02, its pilot trained to cope with the pain, made a diagonal cut with its prog-spear, slicing a strand off. The third slipped out of the blade path, cutting into the armor at its neck.  
天空骤降。只有天使的一条缎带向他们飞来——随即分裂。如同导弹般，每条缎带各自瞄准目标疾驰。三条袭向明日香，其中一条刺穿她右臂，她甚至来不及反应。二号机，其驾驶员训练有素，忍痛用 prog-长矛斜劈，斩断一条缎带。第三条滑出刀锋轨迹，切入颈部装甲。

The scream that answered it was filled with a wretched anger. Unit-02's prog-knife sprang out as she dropped her hold on the spear, the offending strand cut loose as it was swiped free. Unable to reach the first one trying to pin its knife-arm, Asuka grabbed it with the Eva's left hand. Whipping the strand upward, the Angel sheared through half the arm and four of Unit-02's fingers.  
随之而来的尖叫充满痛苦与愤怒。二号机的 prog-刀弹出，她松开长矛，挥刀将冒犯的缎带斩断。无法触及试图钉住刀臂的第一条缎带，明日香用 Eva 的左手抓住它。将缎带猛地向上甩，天使切断了半条手臂和二号机的四根手指。

The red Eva staggered, half collapsing atop a building for support.  
红色 Eva 踉跄着，半跪在一座建筑上以支撑身体。

Two more strands went for Unit-00, who was beyond his field of view, rifle fire rattling off with rapid cracks.  
又有两根触须袭向视野之外的零号机，枪声急促地噼啪作响。

All of this happened as a lance tore into Unit-01's left shoulder and the brain-casing – straight through the left eye and out the other side. His aim went off line. The targeting display screamed – LOCK LOST. Sour, ripping pain blurred his senses, like someone had driven a rail spike through. Even then, he fought the urge to lift his hand and touch his eye, shoving the assist headset up instead. It wouldn't help, just drop his sync-rate lower. Shadows danced in splashing orbs around his left eye, throbbing and bloating with sensory overload.  
这一切发生时，一支长矛刺穿了一号机的左肩和脑壳——直接从左眼穿入，从另一侧穿出。他的瞄准线偏移了。目标锁定显示器尖叫着——锁定丢失。酸涩、撕裂的疼痛模糊了他的感官，仿佛有人用轨道钉刺穿了他。即便如此，他还是强忍着抬起手触摸眼睛的冲动，而是将辅助头盔推了上去。这无济于事，只会让同步率进一步下降。阴影在他的左眼周围跳动，像溅起的球体一样颤动膨胀，因感官过载而愈发剧烈。

Unit-00 bulldozed a small city block to get into the street with him, taking the tendrils in its grasp. It yanked, blue blood splashing the metal as some of its fingers were lopped off, but freeing him. Unit-02 was there a split second later, slicing the strand in two.  
零号机推平了一小块城区，冲上街道与他汇合，紧握住那些触须。它猛地一拽，蓝色的血液溅在金属上，几根手指被切断，但也因此将他解救出来。二号机紧接着出现，将那根触须一分为二。

Shinji muttered something that might have been curses. He couldn't tell. The other Evas hunkered down, to make what remained of his shot clear, their fields torching a sloppy, wild path to clear the way. All he could think about was lifting the railgun, aligning the targeter again.  
真嗣咕哝了一句，可能是咒骂。他不确定。其他 Eva 蹲下身，为了让他剩下的射击更加清晰，它们的力场点燃了一条凌乱、狂野的路径，以清除障碍。他满脑子想的都是抬起轨道炮，再次对准目标。

Too late. 太迟了。

Shinji took it in his sights –  
真嗣将它纳入瞄准镜——

LOCK LOST 锁已丢失

This was his last chance.  
这是他最后的机会。

_-FIRE- -火-_

He pulled the trigger. 他扣下了扳机。

Flame erupted from the muzzle of the gun. There was enough damage to the frame that a rail managed to propel itself free in the firing – a white hot bar of metal slamming into the road at Unit-01's feet. It didn't matter, because the round had already left. In a split second, as that wave of crimson came to shield the Angel – the armature ripped into the sky and shattered through the core.  
火焰从枪口喷涌而出。枪身受损严重，以至于在射击时一根轨道弹射而出——一根炽热的白色金属棒猛地撞击在初号机脚下的路面。但这已无关紧要，因为子弹早已射出。在那片猩红波涛涌来护住使徒的瞬间——那机械臂撕裂天空，贯穿了核心。

What was left of its field became visible, cracks splintering over the flickering image of its inverted Tokyo-3. The façade collapsed into shards that fell and dissipated into wisps of ash, while the Angel's form turned black and seeped as it descended with its torn projection. Light twinkled from the splintered remains of its smoldering core, bright and wild with fury, before the decay of death snuffed it out.  
它残存的力场变得清晰可见，裂纹在闪烁的倒置东京-3 影像上蔓延。外壳崩塌成碎片，化为缕缕灰烬消散，而使徒的形态变得漆黑，随着破损的投影一同下沉。从其冒烟的核心碎片中闪烁着光芒，明亮而狂怒，直到死亡的腐朽将其熄灭。

Metal crashed as the railgun hit the ground. Unit-01 sank forward, the careless weight behind its fist collapsing into a subway tunnel. Shinji's hands shook, damage indicators fading to a shrill whine of white noise.  
金属撞击声响起，电磁炮击中地面。初号机向前倾倒，拳头后不慎的重量压垮了地铁隧道。真嗣的双手颤抖，损伤指示器转为尖锐的白噪音。

An hour later, he boarded a medical VTOL, Unit-00 watching over them as it was secured to the lifts behind Unit 01 and 02. Ash rained from the darkening sky. Paramedics checked him over, Asuka too. Their Evas had both ended up in a bad way.  
一小时后，他登上了一架医疗垂直起降机，零号机在后方监视着，将初号机和二号机固定在升降机上。灰烬从渐暗的天空中飘落。医护人员检查了他和明日香。他们的 EVA 都落得一塌糊涂。

They took his blood pressure, checked his heartbeat. Deep breath in, and then out. His temperature was measured and a few sensory tests were performed. Shinji's left eye was still coloring the world in neon paints, so they taped an eye-patch there to give it time to readjust. Even though his sync-rate hadn't been high enough for him to suffer more than a few popped blood vessels, he was sure he would be feeling the ghost pains for at least a week.  
他们测量了他的血压，检查了他的心跳。深吸一口气，然后呼出。测量体温并进行了几项感官测试。真嗣的左眼仍以霓虹色彩渲染世界，于是他们在那里贴上了眼罩，让眼睛有时间重新适应。尽管他的同步率不足以让他遭受多于几处毛细血管破裂，他确信至少一周内会感受到那虚幻的疼痛。

When the paramedics were done checking him over, he shuffled seats – much to the brief dismay of their escort – to where they had set up Asuka. They'd fit a compression glove over her left hand, probably so she didn't feel like her fingers were falling off every few minutes, and her right arm was in a sling.  
当急救人员完成对他的检查后，他挪动了座位——这让他们的护送人员短暂地感到沮丧——来到了他们安置明日香的地方。他们给她左手戴上了一个压迫手套，可能是为了让她不至于每隔几分钟就感觉手指要掉下来，而她的右臂则被固定在吊带里。

She was sitting on a stretcher, kicking her legs, and scooted away when he sat on it with her. There wasn't a protest when he touched his hip to hers anyway.  
她坐在担架上，晃动着双腿，当他坐到她旁边时，她滑开了一些。但当他用臀部触碰她时，她并没有表示反对。

As they lifted off, Shinji stared at the red sash still knotted to his bicep.  
当他们起飞时，真嗣凝视着仍然系在他二头肌上的红色饰带。

A/N: This wasn't supposed to be a 17k word chapter. But here we are. I don't believe the remaining chapters in Act II will be quite this long, I know they can be tedious to read, but we'll see where we end up. Also, I can't really afford for them to be this long if I want to make updates in a reasonable amount of time, haha. My son, he's 2 and half months old now, and requires quite a lot of attention.  
作者注：这一章原本不该有 17,000 字。但事实如此。我不认为第二幕剩下的章节会这么长，我知道阅读起来可能有些冗长，但最终会如何发展，我们拭目以待。另外，如果我想在合理时间内更新，确实负担不起这么长的篇幅，哈哈。我的儿子，现在已经两个半月大了，需要相当多的关注。

I am very much looking forward to writing this next chapter.  
我非常期待撰写下一章。

Take some time, let me know what you think, and take care.  
花点时间，告诉我你的想法，并请保重。

### Chapter 6: Constellations **星座**
A day after the battle – when the three of them were done with post-op medical examinations and were less irritable from the ghost-pains – Asuka asked for the sash back, in so much that Asuka asked for anything.  
战斗结束后的第二天——当他们完成了术后体检，因幻痛而减少烦躁时——明日香要求归还那条腰带，尽管明日香很少提出要求。

When he wanted to know why, she turned her nose up and said, "I can't trust you with it."  
当他想知道原因时，她扬起鼻子说：“我不能信任你保管它。”

In one of the ready rooms, empty now except for the three pilots, Shinji teased it just beyond her reach – until she turned beet-red and planted a fist into his side. She rushed out with it in hand and Rei fixed him with a look that held nothing in particular, but felt weighted in disappointment.  
在一间空荡荡的准备室里，只剩下三位驾驶员。真嗣拿着东西逗弄着她，让她够不着——直到她脸红得像熟透的番茄，一拳打在他的腰侧。她抓起东西冲了出去，而绫波则用一种看似平淡却带着失望重量的眼神看着他。

At home, Shinji sat in the living room, still and muted. Asuka had yet to come back since the battle, claiming she needed a break from him. It looked like that wouldn't be changing tonight either. Most of her things were still sprawled about, littering the surfaces they'd worked so hard to clean. He spotted her brush on the table and took it, thinking of her in his and Misato's apartment. How this, the quiet, had become a stranger again, unwelcome.  
在家中，真嗣静静地坐在客厅里，沉默无言。明日香自从那场战斗后就没回来过，声称需要从他身边休息一下。看来今晚也不会有变化。她的东西大多还散落一地，弄得他们费尽心思打扫的表面又乱七八糟。他看到桌上的梳子，拿了起来，想着她和美里公寓里的自己。这种宁静，再次变得陌生而不受欢迎。

It let his mind wander back to the battle, to what Okinoshima had said to him. _To kill the wolf in his nightmares_. How would he even do that? Where would he start? The question reminded him of when Erika once asked how he would catch a magic, wish-granting Fox. He hadn't taken those kinds of questions seriously. Why should he? Those were make-believe things that girls like Erika dreamed up.  
这让他的思绪飘回到战斗中，回想起冲岛对他说的话。要杀死他梦魇中的狼。他该如何做到？从哪里开始？这个问题让他想起艾丽卡曾经问过他如何捕捉一只会魔法、能实现愿望的狐狸。他当时并没有认真对待这类问题。为什么要呢？那些都是像艾丽卡这样的女孩幻想出来的东西。

But the wolf didn't feel like a dream anymore, not since he was almost swallowed whole by the Seventh Angel. It was just a dream, but it wasn't. The wolf's eyes, he started to think, were the same as the dog they'd buried – hollow and gnawing.  
但那匹狼不再像是一场梦了，自从他几乎被第七使徒整个吞噬之后。那只是一个梦，但又不仅仅是个梦。狼的眼睛，他开始觉得，与他们埋葬的那只狗的眼睛如出一辙——空洞而啃噬人心。

How could he kill the wolf? Shinji spent enough time thinking about it to be sick.  
他怎能杀死那匹狼？真嗣为此思索得几乎作呕。

He thought of it well into the next day, even as they rode away from the city, swinging around Lake Ashi and taking the Tsubaki road out of the caldera in Misato's Renault. Its fangs bit into him, chewing at the back of his neck. As the distance increased, the bite sank deeper – and the Eva's tethers pulled on him as if he were in the plug, waiting to be deployed.  
他一直思考到第二天，即便他们驾车离开城市，绕过芦之湖，沿着御崎路驶出火山口，坐在美里小姐的雷诺车上。狼的尖牙咬噬着他，啃食着他的后颈。随着距离的拉远，那咬痕愈发深入——而 EVA 的束缚仿佛他正身处插入栓中，等待着出击命令。

Asuka bobbed his knee as she caught him twisted 'round to peer out of the back windshield. After a second kick, he sat proper. Eyeing to make sure her silent command was followed, she flicked her hair and focused ahead.  
明日香轻晃着膝盖，见他扭过身来透过后窗向外窥视。踢了第二下后，他端正坐好。她瞥了一眼，确保她的无声命令已被遵循，随即甩了甩头发，目光重新聚焦前方。

"Why do you have to come out here again?" She asked, uncrossing, and then crossing her legs.  
“你为什么非得再出来一趟？”她问道，先是解开，然后又交叉起双腿。

Misato glanced at her in the rearview. "Because I have to make a visual inspection of the Angel cleanup effort."  
美里从后视镜中瞥了她一眼。“因为我得对使徒清理工作进行一次视觉检查。”

"You mean the Seventh? They're still doing that?"  
"你是说第七区？他们还在搞那个？"

"It was a big Angel."  
"那是个大天使。"

"Why is that your job?"  
"为什么这是你的工作？"

She released a sigh. "Mostly because the Sub-Commander delegated the task to me."  
她叹了口气。“主要是因为副司令把这个任务交给了我。”

They embraced the rest of the Tsubaki line with the rushing of rubber along asphalt, distilled by the quiet babble of Misato's radio. The terrain along the road opened up to swells of earth that stretched down to the coast line. Tents dotted it farther than he could see, distant trucks and engines at work. They rolled past a NERV checkpoint and alongside several prefab buildings stilted up in a square.  
他们随着橡胶轮胎在柏油路上的疾驰，以及美里车内收音机的低语，拥抱了剩余的椿一族。道路旁的景色开阔，起伏的土丘一直延伸到海岸线。远处的帐篷星罗棋布，隐约可见忙碌的卡车和引擎。他们驶过一个 NERV 的检查站，旁边是几座用预制构件搭建的方形建筑。

Dust followed them and Shinji covered his face as they stepped out.  
尘土紧随其后，真嗣下车时用手遮住了脸。

"We're gonna walk around Misato!" Asuka called, tugging on his arm as she passed.  
“我们要在美里周围走走！”明日香喊道，经过时拉了拉他的手臂。

"Don't go far," she said, whatever 'far' meant.  
“别走太远，”她说，尽管她也不知道“太远”究竟是多远。

Asuka talked for a while, trying to keep him steady and there, instead of in the Cages – until the noise took them both, words swallowed by the crunch of grass beneath their shoes. Roaring engines churned over the countryside. Sea salt came crisp on the breeze from the ocean, cooling their skin in the still heat.  
明日香说了一会儿话，试图让他保持稳定和存在感，而不是在笼子里——直到噪音吞没了他们，话语被脚下草地的嘎吱声淹没。咆哮的引擎在乡间轰鸣。海风带来了清新的海盐味，在依旧闷热的空气中给他们的皮肤带来一丝凉意。

Ahead of them were barren, jagged hills. Grown over roads – marked as deep, weed riddled trenches – snaked along the fissures of the slopes. Squared out plots were all that remained of the hundreds of homes, nothing left but cinder block and old roads, the ribcage of a much larger city jutting out of the coastline. As though a titan had smeared its hand over it.  
在他们前方，是荒凉崎岖的山丘。曾经的路已被野草覆盖，深陷成杂草丛生的沟壑，蜿蜒于山坡的裂缝之间。方形的空地是数百座房屋仅存的痕迹，只剩下煤渣砖和旧路，一座更大城市的骨架从海岸线突兀而出。仿佛一位巨人曾用手将其抹平。

Boats left tilted on the edge of what were once rice fields. A silhouette in the mud, which had dried and cracked, human shaped and face down.  
船只倾斜在曾是稻田的边缘。泥泞中有一个干裂的人形轮廓，面朝下躺着。

The place seemed more like a burial ground than a ruin.  
这个地方更像是一个墓地，而非废墟。

They did their best to keep the mobile HQ in sight. Manageable enough until they reached a sharp drop, where a hill that may have been a street zigzagged down the slope. Bits of concrete slab shown under their scuffed shoes, remnants of wooden support beams still standing where there had been superstructure. Shinji crept forward to the edge of the drop, his heart shaking, peering over to see the patchwork of stone foundation they stood atop, not yet reclaimed by nature.  
他们尽力保持移动总部的视野。直到遇到一个陡峭的下降，那里可能曾经是一条街道的小山丘蜿蜒而下。他们磨损的鞋子下露出混凝土碎块，木质支撑梁的残骸依然矗立在曾经是上层结构的地方。真嗣小心翼翼地向前挪到边缘，心跳加速，俯视着他们脚下的石质地基拼凑而成的地面，尚未被大自然重新夺回。

"How boring," Asuka said, wistful.  
“真无聊，”明日香说，带着一丝怀旧。

Shinji slipped his hands into his pockets. "You didn't have to come, you know."  
真嗣将手插进口袋。“你知道的，你不必非得来。”

She bit on her lower lip to hold in a retort, hands knitting behind her back as she too leaned over the edge.  
她咬住下唇，忍住反驳的话，双手在背后交缠，身体也向前倾靠在边缘。

"Wouldn't you rather hang out with Kaji, or something?" He asked.  
“你不是更想和加持一起出去玩吗？”他问道。

"That's not any of your business, is it?"  
“这跟你有什么关系吗？”

His left eye blurred, a dull ache like he'd just been jabbed. Memory and anxiety recalled the last battle.  
他的左眼模糊了，一阵钝痛袭来，仿佛刚被刺了一下。记忆和焦虑让他回想起上一场战斗。

Asuka sat on the edge of the foundation, kicking her feet. He stood for a while before joining her, the feel of warm rock against his calves familiar. There was something else bothering her, and he knew enough about what to leave it be. They traded bits of loose stone and tried to hit a crooked stop sign.  
明日香坐在地基边缘，晃动着双脚。他站了一会儿才走过去加入她，温暖的岩石抵着他的小腿，感觉很熟悉。她还有别的心事，他知道得足够多，不去触碰。他们互相扔着碎石，试图击中一个歪斜的停车标志。

"Hey," she said, priming a rock. "We're friends, right?"  
“嘿，”她拿起一块石头准备投掷，“我们是朋友，对吧？”

Her shot went wide of the sign. Shinji didn't answer right away. She picked up another and threw it with teeth grit. It arced far over her mark and she set her hands on the edge, gripping tight.  
她的投掷偏离了目标。真嗣没有立即回应。她又拿起一块石头，咬紧牙关扔了出去。石头高高飞过她的目标，她双手紧握边缘，紧紧抓牢。

"Yeah," he said after what felt like too long. What else could they be? He snagged a jagged rock and chucked. It made a hollow thud against the rusted frame of a car.  
“嗯，”他过了好一会儿才回答。还能是什么呢？他抓起一块锋利的石头扔了出去。石头击中了一辆锈迹斑斑的汽车的框架，发出沉闷的声响。

A horn blared, Misato's Renault. Asuka jumped to her feet and led the way back.  
喇叭声响起，是美里驾驶的雷诺车。明日香跳起身来，带头返回。

His anxiety melted into his shoulders, though never left. There was something about that place that subdued them, smoothed away the rough edges, a feeling from his boyhood on the estate. Asuka didn't speak until they entered the caldera again, and the spell of the garden lifted.  
他的焦虑融入了双肩，却未曾消散。那个地方有种力量，能平息一切，抚平棱角，让他回想起在庄园度过的童年时光。明日香直到他们再次进入火山口，花园的魔力消退后才开口说话。

Rei remembered the first time she had ever lied. Remembered when she discovered she could do so and not be found out. It was a great and liberating moment, her first anxious lie.  
绫波记得她第一次撒谎的时刻。记得她发现自己可以这样做而不被揭穿的那一刻。那是一个伟大而解放的时刻，她的第一个焦虑的谎言。

That evening in the Cages had been a dry, blistering one – the feeling of outside lingering with her as she fell into the clean-cold embrace of Headquarters. She sat hunched in the seat of Unit-00's plug, a courtesy granted to her by the pit crew. They would not be testing her, not today. Her injuries were still too tender, the Eva's behavior still too unpredictable. So she was allowed that small comfort to help the time pass.  
那天晚上在笼子里，天气干燥而酷热——外面的感觉伴随着她，当她陷入总部干净而冰冷的怀抱时。她蜷缩在零号机插入栓的座位上，这是维修班给予她的礼遇。今天不会对她进行测试，她的伤势仍然太脆弱，Eva 的行为仍然太不可预测。所以她被允许享受那一点点舒适，帮助时间流逝。

There, she was poured over a book, pages inked with old poetry. She'd read it through in the night already, as she had many nights before that, and noticed with some discontent that creases had begun to break down the spine.  
在那里，她沉浸在一本书中，书页上墨迹斑斑，尽是古老的诗篇。她已在夜色中将其细细读过，正如往昔无数个夜晚那般，却带着几分不满地发现，书脊处的折痕已开始断裂。

"You wrote these?" Shinji had said to her after her first disastrous test, loitering in her apartment like he usually did, but not in a way that she minded.  
“这些是你写的？”真嗣在她第一次糟糕的测试后问道，像往常一样在她公寓里徘徊，但并未让她感到介意。

Rei spied a notebook in his hands, watching him flip through the pages. "Yes," she said, a tickle of something spilling through her.  
丽注意到他手中拿着一本笔记本，看着他翻阅着页面。“是的，”她说，一丝莫名的情绪涌上心头。

He had nodded, making a thoughtful face. "I don't really understand poetry, but it seems good."  
他点了点头，露出一副深思的表情。“我不太懂诗歌，但似乎很不错。”

Not knowing what she was supposed to say to that, she said nothing, and he sat back down to continue homework with her. She wondered what might make her ponderings 'good'. Before leaving, he asked her when her birthday was.  
不知道该对此说些什么，她选择了沉默，而他则坐回原位继续和她一起做作业。她好奇是什么会让她的思考显得‘好’。临走前，他问她生日是什么时候。

"Birthday?" “生日？”

"Yeah, the day you were born?"  
“是啊，你出生的那天？”

Rei hadn't known and told him as much. After, she asked the only person who might have the answer.  
丽并不知情，如实告诉了他。之后，她询问了唯一可能知道答案的人。

"You were created in the first month of Spring," the Commander had said. "That should suffice."  
“你在春天的第一个月被创造出来，”指挥官曾说，“这应该足够了。”

The man had not given her a smile. He did not like the question. It was like a cold hand reached into her and squeezed. Rei occupied her seat at school, less there than she had been before. Less of herself than she ever thought she might be.  
那男人没有对她微笑。他不喜欢这个问题。就像一只冰冷的手伸进她的内心，紧紧地捏了一把。零在学校的位置上坐着，感觉自己比以前少了些什么。比她曾经以为的自己还要少。

Created. Not born. 被创造。非天生。

At the end of the day, a book was laid on her desk.  
一天结束时，一本书被放在了她的桌上。

"I thought I'd get you something for your birthday," Shinji said, staring at it, "but since you don't know, just have this."  
"我本想给你准备个生日礼物，" 真嗣说道，目光紧盯着它，"但既然你不知道，那就收下这个吧。"

He watched her as her fingers took it, feeling the laminated front, edges already well worn.  
他注视着她用手指接过，感受着那层压的封面，边缘已经磨损得很厉害。

"Like I said, I don't know anything about poetry, but maybe you'll like it. I can take it back if you don't."  
"就像我说的，我对诗歌一窍不通，但也许你会喜欢。如果你不喜欢，我可以拿回去。"

Rei said the only two words she could think to say. "Thank you."  
丽说出了她唯一能想到的两个词。“谢谢你。”

At first, she wanted to destroy it. That would be a reasonable act for asking useless questions of the Commander, who she now knew could choose to not smile at her. In her apartment, she set it atop a cardboard box behind her bed, where it would stay and be forgotten. At night, as she curled into her bed for sleep, it held her gaze for hours until her eyes couldn't stay open. In the morning it greeted her. As she dressed, it watched her. As she showered, she felt it.  
起初，她想毁掉它。对指挥官提出无用的问题，现在她知道他可以选择不向她微笑，这种行为理应得到这样的回应。在她公寓里，她把它放在床后的一个纸箱上，那里将被遗忘。夜晚，当她蜷缩在床上入睡时，它吸引了她数小时的目光，直到她的眼睛无法再睁开。早晨，它向她问好。她穿衣时，它在注视着她。她洗澡时，她能感觉到它。

Rei came home to it touched by the light running through the gap in her curtains. She took it in her hands, white fire in her palms. Paper slipped over her fingers, an old smell rising from the pages, sweet almond and pressed wood.  
丽回到家，发现它被窗帘缝隙透过的光线触碰。她把它捧在手中，掌心燃起白色的火焰。纸张滑过她的手指，从书页中升起一股陈旧的气味，甜杏仁和压木的香气。

On sleepless nights, it became her companion and accompanied her wherever she went. Scribbled notes appeared in the outlying space of the text, words circled and underlined.  
在那些无眠的夜晚，它成了她的伴侣，无论她走到哪里都伴随着她。书页边缘出现了潦草的笔记，词语被圈出并加下划线。

It was after one of her checkups that Doctor Akagi told her she had a fever. Pale fire burned in her schoolbag nearby.  
在一次检查后，赤城医生告诉她发烧了。她的书包旁，苍白的火焰在燃烧。

"You have been spending time with the Third Child," the Commander said, the back of his hand against her forehead.  
“你一直在和第三适格者相处，”指挥官说道，手背贴在她的额头上。

"Yes," she said. She did not want to tell him.  
“是的，”她说。她不想告诉他。

Then that night in the Cages came.  
然后，那个在笼子里的夜晚来临了。

"Rei." Never before had the quiet of his voice struck her. "What is that?"  
“丽。”他的声音从未如此平静，让她感到震撼。“那是什么？”

"A homework assignment," she said, setting it aside and out of view as she looked up. "It is not important."  
"一个家庭作业任务，" 她说着将其搁置一旁，避开了视线。"并不重要。"

The Commander's eyes searched her, as they searched everyone.  
指挥官的目光在她身上搜寻，正如他对每个人所做的那样。

"I see," he said, "the time will come for you to be tested again soon. You must not be distracted."  
"我明白了，" 他说，"不久你将再次面临考验。你不可分心。"

"Yes, sir." "是的，长官。"

The man left and she didn't dare reveal it again until he was out of sight, holding the book to her chest. Rei kept it secret from him. Her first disobedience.  
男人离开后，她不敢再显露出来，直到他的身影消失不见，她将书紧紧抱在胸前。丽将它对他保密。这是她的第一次违抗。

This was not like the things she adopted from the Commander. Old, well-worn physics books and broken glasses, things that were more his than hers. It was her gift and no one else's.  
这与她从指挥官那里继承的东西不同。那些老旧的物理书籍和破损的眼镜，更多是属于他的而非她的。这是她的礼物，独属于她一人。

It was _hers_. 这是她的。

Rei remembered her first lie, the memory touched with guilt. The need to do so again ate at her, but this was not a thing she could hide or withhold. The evidence marred and bruised every part of her, covered her in a haphazard array of band-aids and bandages. Before, they had been bandages from the Eva, from herself. These were still from self-inflicted wounds, but of a different nature. These made the swollen nights shrivel and deflate, let her sleep without shadows and whispers that needed to be written down lest they become nothing and nebulous again.  
丽记得她的第一个谎言，那份记忆带着内疚。再次这样做的需要啃噬着她，但这不是她能隐藏或保留的事情。证据玷污并伤害了她身体的每一部分，用随意贴上的创可贴和绷带覆盖着她。以前，那些绷带来自 Eva，来自她自己。这些仍然是自伤的痕迹，但性质不同。这些让肿胀的夜晚萎缩和消退，让她在没有阴影和需要记录下来的低语中入睡，以免它们再次变得无足轻重和模糊不清。

"Better?" Shinji might ask, watching her drink the miso he'd brought in a thermos.  
“好些了吗？”真嗣可能会问，看着她喝下他带来的保温瓶里的味噌汤。

It wasn't the same as before, so maybe it could only be better. Because after each fall, the time between them shrank and the stretches of road she navigated became longer and more complicated. As it was now, she hadn't fallen for several days. Turns were still new, uncertain, and exhilarating. Adrenaline kicked her just imagining it, and her legs ached to wind the pedals. To uncover a city that was interlinked by garden laden alleyways, where Tokyo-3 played a discordant soundtrack of music, arguments, and laughter. The rushing babble from lives too insular and complex for her to imagine.  
与以往不同，或许只会变得更好。因为每次跌倒后，间隔的时间缩短了，她所驾驭的路途也变得更长、更复杂。如今，她已有好几天没有摔倒。转弯依旧新鲜、不确定且令人兴奋。仅仅是想象就让她肾上腺素飙升，双腿渴望踩动踏板。去探索一个由花园点缀的小巷交织而成的城市，那里东京-3 上演着不和谐的音乐、争论和笑声的交响曲。来自那些过于孤立和复杂的生活的喧嚣，是她难以想象的。

The world had become bigger, and her place in it more insignificant, more alone. Even with Suzahara and Aida racing alongside her. What was once a background hum had turned into a resounding chorus. Rei wanted more, but could sense the frailty of her grasp on it. There would be no lying about it to the Commander. He knew her every step, at every hour, at every minute. Knew exactly what she was thinking and feeling at every moment.  
世界变得更大了，而她在其中的位置更加微不足道，更加孤独。即便有铃原和相田在旁边一起比赛。曾经背景中的嗡嗡声已变成响亮的合唱。丽渴望更多，但能感觉到自己对这一切的把握是多么脆弱。无法向指挥官隐瞒这一点。他了解她每一步，每时每刻，每一分钟。确切地知道她每一刻的想法和感受。

A different sensation caught her in a tremor, new and vile. Its pounding anxiety shattered her, tiny pieces of her trickling away. It pervaded every part of her being now, deep in Dogma, tucked in the processor of the LCL Plant. Her baseline test was sufficient and Doctor Akagi finished her usual maintenance of the system, performed at great length, before exhausting every excuse she had to remain there with the two of them.  
一种异样的感觉让她颤抖，陌生而恶劣。那股焦虑如重锤般击碎了她，碎片般的自我悄然流逝。它现在渗透了她每一个角落，深藏在教条区，隐匿于 LCL 工厂的处理核心中。她的基线测试足够充分，赤木博士完成了她惯常的系统维护，耗时良久，之后用尽所有借口留在他们两人身边。

When she was gone, the Commander's footsteps approached, pulled away from the dark vats along the chamber. As she stood, fully dressed once more, bag slung over her shoulder – he touched her arm at the elbow, lifting it upon two fingers.  
当她离开后，指挥官的脚步声靠近，从黑暗的反应池边沿走来。她重新整装待发，肩上挎着包——他用两根手指轻轻托起她的手臂，触碰她的肘部。

"These injuries." “这些伤。”

The words rolled like gravel. They had never sounded harsh before.  
话语如砂砾般滚动，它们从未显得如此刺耳。

Rei met his eyes. "I apologize, Commander."  
丽与他对视，“我道歉，指挥官。”

He held them, even when he let her arm fall back to her side.  
他紧握着它们，即便在她手臂垂回身侧时亦未松开。

"You will focus on your duties. Do you understand?"  
"你将专注于你的职责。明白吗？"

She nodded, wishing to disappear.  
她点点头，希望自己能消失。

"Yes, sir." "是的，长官。"

It was detected at a geosynchronous orbit.  
它是在地球同步轨道上被探测到的。

From groundside, there appeared to be a black gap in the Canis Major constellation where the star Sirius should have been. Hitching to the nearest satellites, MAGI confirmed a Pattern Blue and the Evas were brought to combat readiness.  
从地面望去，大犬座中本应是天狼星的位置出现了一个黑色的缺口。MAGI 紧急联系最近的卫星，确认了蓝色模式，EVA 机体随即进入战斗准备状态。

They waited. When there was no significant change in the Angel's speed or trajectory, they were allowed to go home – its estimated arrival more than eleven days. Deep wind chimes sang from one of the balconies of an adjacent apartment, and the two Filipino men argued with their Korean neighbors. After the claustrophobia of the last battle, Tokyo-3 breathed a sigh of relief.  
他们等待着。当使徒的速度和轨迹没有显著变化时，他们被允许回家——预计到达时间超过十一天。一阵深沉的风铃声从相邻公寓的阳台上传来，两位菲律宾男子正与他们的韩国邻居争论。经历了上一场战斗的窒息感后，第三新东京市松了一口气。

Life resumed as normal. 生活恢复了正常。

The morning was pink and tender. She checked her phone. Scratch that: it was afternoon. A notion to get out of bed stirred in her, and she dreamed a bit more of rising, only to realize she hadn't moved a muscle. Sheets pooled between her legs as she sat, one hand rubbing an eye, the other exploring piles of laundry for clean clothes.  
清晨泛着粉嫩的柔光。她瞥了眼手机。不对，已是午后。起床的念头在她心中微动，她又梦见自己起身，却发现身体纹丝未动。床单在她双腿间堆积，她坐起身，一手揉着眼，另一手在成堆的衣物中摸索着干净的衣裳。

Finding purchase on a pair of cut-off jean shorts, she tugged it closer – something tiny and blue flopping over her thigh. A little thumb drive. The same one that had been left in her office. She picked it up, touched by the vague notion of tossing it in the trash bin across the room.  
她从一堆衣物中拽出一条牛仔短裤，忽然有样小巧的蓝色物件从大腿上滑落。是一个小小的 U 盘。正是留在她办公室的那个。她拾起它，心中闪过一丝将其扔进房间对面垃圾桶的模糊念头。

_I dreamed of you again last night, Kaji. You seem to appear in them often, like you used to. Did I ever tell you that?  
昨晚我又梦见你了，Kaji。你似乎经常出现在我的梦中，就像从前那样。我有没有告诉过你呢？_

"You ever listen to Antonio Carlos?" Kaji asked in her dream, like he'd asked when they first met. "You know, Stoneflower?"  
"你听过安东尼奥·卡洛斯吗？" 在她的梦中，Kaji 问道，就像他们初次相遇时那样。"你知道，《石花》吗？"

"This sounds like elevator music," she'd said when he let her listen from his headphones, thankful when he didn't take it away. He rested against the baluster she was leaning on, raised a full three heads above him.  
"这听起来像电梯音乐，" 当他让她从耳机里听时，她曾这样说道，庆幸他没有把音乐关掉。他靠在她倚着的栏杆上，比她高出整整三个头。

"You must ride in some fancy elevators," he said, head bobbing and hands tapping on imaginary cymbals in time with the music. "It's got spirit. Like it's asking you to dance – a little flirtatious." Kaji looked up when he said it, his face brushing into her hair.  
"你一定坐过一些豪华电梯，" 他说道，头随着音乐摇摆，双手在想象中的钹上敲打，与音乐同步。"它充满了活力。就像在邀请你跳舞——有点挑逗。" Kaji 抬头时，他的脸轻轻擦过她的头发。

Misato didn't pull away. "Are you coming on to me?"  
美里没有退缩。“你在向我示好吗？”

"Would you go on a date with me if I said yes?"  
“如果我说是，你会和我约会吗？”

Misato set the thumb drive on her pillow and got to her feet, bundle of fresh wear in tow. In the shower, hot water beat her back while she leaned against the wall. Blank time passed before she was convinced to move and wash. She dried, dressed, brushed her teeth. Air hummed in the apartment, thin and restless. For a while she stood there, the ache of fatigue hanging onto her.  
美里将 U 盘放在枕头上，站起身来，手里拿着一捆新衣服。在淋浴间里，热水拍打在她的背上，她靠在墙上。空白的时间流逝，直到她被说服去移动和清洗。她擦干身体，穿上衣服，刷了牙。公寓里的空气嗡嗡作响，稀薄而不安。她站在那里好一会儿，疲惫的痛楚仍缠绕着她。

"_Would you go on a date with me if I said yes?"_  
"如果我说愿意，你会和我约会吗？"

Misato stared at the mirror. It stared back.  
美里盯着镜子。镜子也回望着她。

The kitchen light gave a little life to her collection of empty rooms, chasing away the sterile cold that had settled in her slumber. At the time, she'd said no. They got together later on some beach north of Ichiburi, when there was plenty of alcohol to encourage them.  
厨房的灯光为她的空房间带来了一丝生机，驱散了在她沉睡时积聚的冰冷死寂。那时，她说了不。后来他们在市镇北边的一个海滩上走到了一起，那时有足够的酒精来助兴。

Misato flipped the TV to a gameshow station – loud and trivial, settling on the fold out futon with her laptop and a pair of beers. A collection of Shinji and Asuka's things lay about the table.  
美里将电视调到游戏节目频道——喧闹而琐碎，她坐在折叠式蒲团上，膝上放着笔记本电脑，手边还有两罐啤酒。桌上散落着真嗣和明日香的一些物品。

There, she logged into NERV's task manager, going through emails, updating herself on inter-department communications, reading the same lines over and over because her brain was still waking up. Her fingers tapped a tune, her throat flirting with humming along. Sensing life, PenPen waddled out and wedged his stomach against her leg, cooing.  
她登录了 NERV 的任务管理器，浏览邮件，更新部门间的通讯，一遍遍读着同样的句子，因为她的脑子还在慢慢清醒。她的手指敲击着节奏，喉咙不自觉地跟着哼唱。感受到动静，企鹅潘潘摇摇摆摆地走出来，将肚子贴在她的腿上，咕咕叫着。

A hiss snapped down the hall.  
走廊尽头传来一声嘶嘶声。

"I'm home." Shinji stepped into the kitchen, setting his bag down in an open chair before catching sight of her. "Hey, you're off today?"  
"我回来了。" 真嗣走进厨房，将书包放在一张空椅子上，随即看到了她。"嘿，你今天休息吗？"

"Looks like it, kiddo." "看起来是的，小子。"

She went back to her laptop, trying again to make sense of the words in front of her, or remember how to use the keyboard. Misato took a sip of beer instead. Her ears listened to his movements – feet scuffing on the linoleum, rollers and kitchenware scraping.  
她回到笔记本电脑前，再次试图理解眼前的文字，或是回忆如何使用键盘。美里喝了一口啤酒。她的耳朵聆听着他的动静——脚在油毡上摩擦，滚轮和厨具的刮擦声。

"The Angel's still on trajectory. No changes," she said, because her brain was caught between listening and working – and found it could do neither.  
“天使的轨迹未变，一切正常，”她说道，因为她的思绪卡在了聆听与工作之间——结果两样都做不成。

The noise stopped. "Oh, alright."  
噪音停止了。“哦，好吧。”

Pans sizzled batter, the smell making her warm while her stomach ached. She was scrolling through the overdue tasks on her list, searching for one or two she could pass off as done. It was better than trying to read the same sentence over and over.  
平底锅里的面糊滋滋作响，香气让她感到温暖，而胃却在隐隐作痛。她正翻阅着逾期未完成的任务清单，寻找着一两个可以勉强算作完成的任务。这总比一遍又一遍地读着同一句话要好。

Shinji came around to the futon and she scooted over to make room, even though there was plenty. He crossed his legs and sat a plate of dorayaki there – bean paste sandwiched between pancakes. Catching her eyeing them, he held out the plate, but she put a hand up and shook her head.  
真嗣绕到被褥旁，她挪了挪身子腾出空间，尽管地方还很宽敞。他盘腿坐下，面前摆着一盘铜锣烧——豆沙夹在煎饼之间。注意到她在盯着看，他便递出盘子，但她摆了摆手，摇了摇头。

PenPen, shameless, left her to wedge himself between Shinji's arm and the plate. A wave of hunger hit her, but she drank more beer. It was easier to buzz on an empty stomach – and she wanted everything to feel warm and hazy at the edges. At least then it might be fun to stare at corporate drivel.  
企鹅 PenPen 毫不客气地挤到真嗣的胳膊和盘子之间。一阵饥饿感袭来，但她又喝了几口啤酒。空腹时更容易微醺——她希望一切都能在边缘处变得温暖而模糊。至少那样盯着公司的废话可能会觉得有趣些。

"Hey, Misato." “嘿，美里。”

"Mm?" He was still watching the TV, meal untouched. She wanted to ask him if he'd taken any of his medication today.  
"嗯？" 他还在看电视，饭菜未动。她想问他今天是否吃过药了。

"What kind of stuff did you and Kaji do together? When you were dating, I mean."  
"你和加持以前都做些什么？我是说，你们约会的时候。"

Misato went for a draw of beer. Empty. Another cracked open in her hand. "The usual couple's stuff, I guess."  
美里伸手去拿啤酒，却是空的。她又开了一罐，"大概就是情侣间常做的事吧。"

She set to work on an in-house incident report, weeks overdue. Not a single word drew itself onto the page, no matter how hard she stared at it. Another draw of beer.  
她开始着手写一份拖延已久的内部事故报告。无论她怎么盯着页面，一个字也写不出来。又喝了一口啤酒。

"He said you two used to drive out to the beach in his car, uh... a nineteen-seventy-seven, something."  
“他说你们俩以前经常开他的车去海边，呃……一辆一九七七年的，什么车来着。”

"Celica," she said, sighing. "It was a Toyota Celica." In her periphery, he sank into the futon, looking back to the TV. Guilt sledgehammered her gut. She sipped again, mumbling, "Ugly ass car."  
“赛利卡，”她叹了口气说，“那是一辆丰田赛利卡。”她眼角瞥见他陷进蒲团里，目光转回电视。内疚像重锤一样击中她的腹部。她又抿了一口，喃喃自语：“丑得要命的车。”

"He said the hood space was nice."  
"他说那个兜帽空间挺不错的。"

"I'm sure he did." "他当然会这么说。"

"You made bonfires and ate watermelon."  
"你们点了篝火，还吃了西瓜。"

"Yup." "是啊。"

"It sounded nice." "听起来不错。"

"It was." "确实如此。"

Shinji stayed a few stunted minutes longer before excusing himself, the door to his room whispering shut. Left behind on the cushion next to her was his plate of dorayaki, still whole and uneaten. She hadn't even asked him how his day was. Misato shook her mostly empty yebisu can, drops of beer slithering around the bottom. She set her laptop aside and began to eat. The bean paste had gone cold.  
真嗣又呆滞了几分钟，然后告辞离开，房门轻轻合上。留在她旁边垫子上的，是他那份未动一口的铜锣烧。她甚至没问他今天过得怎么样。美里摇了摇几乎空了的惠比寿啤酒罐，几滴啤酒在底部滑来滑去。她把笔记本电脑放在一旁，开始吃东西。豆沙已经凉了。

It wasn't long before she grabbed another pair of beers, lying on the futon and drinking herself back to sleep with the mindless blare of the TV to keep her company.  
没过多久，她又抓起两罐啤酒，躺在被褥上，在电视的无脑喧嚣中把自己灌回梦乡。

---

Shinji hovered by his shoe locker, watching other students exchange footwear at theirs. A shade of blue passed his perimeter, and he tracked Rei as she broke off from the throng of students. As she neared the gate leading out of the courtyard, he let his attention fall to remove his uwabaki and retrieve his tattered vans. When he looked up, she was gone and a familiar splinter wedged into him.  
真嗣徘徊在鞋柜旁，看着其他学生交换鞋子。一抹蓝色掠过他的视线，他注意到绫波从人群中脱离。当她走近通往庭院外的门时，他低下头脱下室内鞋，取出那双破旧的帆布鞋。当他再次抬头时，她已经不见了，一种熟悉的刺痛感袭上心头。

Rei was out on one of those rental bikes every chance she got, along with Aida and Suzahara. He saw them tagging along behind her after school, sometimes with Horaki, Kirishima, or Shoho. It was clockwork, the new routine, another way to make her unknown to him. Yet she let them surround her so easily, took it as if it was nothing – while he was lucky to get verbal acknowledgement from anyone other than Aida.  
丽每次有机会都会骑着那些租赁自行车，和相田、铃原一起。他看到他们放学后跟在她后面，有时还有洞木、雾岛或相武。这是新的日常，像钟表一样规律，是她让他感到陌生的另一种方式。然而她却如此轻易地让他们围绕在她身边，仿佛这根本不算什么——而他能从相田以外的人那里得到口头上的认可就已经很幸运了。

What was burning him the most, he couldn't say, not out loud. Not to her. Maybe not to anyone, and that just made it worse. It meant that maybe he didn't know her as well as he thought, and if that was true, it meant he could be as little as nothing to her. She was the girl who was frail, but worthy of his father's attention. The girl who put herself between him and Angels. The girl who was a shadow but could quiet a room full of people.  
最让他煎熬的是什么，他无法大声说出来。不能对她，也许也不能对任何人说，这只会让情况更糟。这意味着也许他并不像自己以为的那样了解她，如果这是真的，那就意味着他对她来说可能微不足道。她是那个脆弱却值得他父亲关注的女孩。是那个站在他和使徒之间的女孩。是那个虽是影子却能令满屋人安静的女孩。

Who was that? 她是谁？

He thought he'd known, like he had thought he'd known other people.  
他以为他了解，就像他以为他了解其他人一样。

Aida took up a post to his right, Suzahara standing apart.  
Aida 站在他的右边，Suzahara 则独自站着。

"What's up with her? I mean, Ayanami's always been a little..." he made a vague gesture with his hand, "but she didn't even want to ride today."  
她怎么了？我是说，绫波一直有点..." 他用手做了一个模糊的手势，"但她今天甚至不想骑车。

"Beats me," Shinji managed, slipping his heels in and bending to tie the laces. He hadn't spoken to her most of the week.  
“我怎么知道，”真嗣勉强回答，把脚跟滑进鞋里，弯腰系鞋带。这一周他大部分时间都没和她说话。

"She does seem quieter than usual," Suzahara said.  
“她确实比平时安静，”铃原说。

A sidelong glance. "How would you know?" He knew it didn't matter what the boy said or thought, but the searing coals in his chest felt otherwise.  
一个侧目。“你怎么会知道？”他知道这男孩说什么或怎么想都无关紧要，但胸中灼热的煤炭却让他感觉并非如此。

Suzahara folded his arms, staring at the spot Rei had disappeared. They changed into their normal shoes and towed along as Shinji passed the baseball fields. He wasn't entirely sure where he was going yet. Asuka was in one of her grand moods, and so was everyone else that occupied his small, insignificant sphere of influence. So, he was wayward, and wished the two boys at his back would go away and perhaps leave him alone forever.  
铃原抱起双臂，盯着零消失的地方。他们换上平常的鞋子，跟着真嗣经过棒球场。他还不完全确定要去哪里。明日香正处于她的大情绪中，其他占据他微不足道生活圈的人也是如此。所以，他漫无目的，希望身后那两个男孩能离开，或许永远让他一个人待着。

"Maybe you should talk to her, Ikari," Suzahara said.  
“也许你应该和她谈谈，碇，”铃原说。

Shinji hummed, adjusting the strap of his bag, heart beating faster. "Why don't you?"  
真嗣哼了一声，调整了书包的带子，心跳加速。“你为什么不呢？”

An impact sent him lurching. He caught himself and spun – Suzahara recovering from the shove.  
一次冲击让他踉跄。他稳住身形，转身——铃原从推搡中恢复过来。

"Do you ever stop feeling sorry for yourself?!"  
“你难道从不停止自怨自艾吗？！”

The boy kept shouting. Accusations, maybe. Shinji didn't understand, not then – a rush of heat running through him and blotting out reason.  
男孩继续叫喊。或许是责备。真嗣当时并不理解，一股热流涌遍全身，理智荡然无存。

Suzahara said Rei's name.  
铃原叫了零的名字。

Then his fist was slamming into the Osakan's jaw.  
接着他的拳头猛击在了大阪人的下巴上。

---

There was nothing to do but wait. It was turning into the great pattern of Asuka's life. Wait to leave home. Wait for her Eva to be built. Wait for the Angels to attack.  
除了等待别无他法。这正逐渐成为明日香生活的常态。等待离开家。等待她的 EVA 建造完成。等待使徒的攻击。

Wait for Kaji to show up.  
等着加持出现。

Banners and streamers hung from the canopies of the corridor, loud with an assortment of people and megaphones and chimes. Asuka shook her iced coffee and sipped. Buzzers and shouts intruded from the pachinko parlor on her right.  
走廊的遮阳篷下挂满了横幅和彩带，人声鼎沸，喇叭和铃声此起彼伏。明日香摇了摇手中的冰咖啡，抿了一口。右侧的弹珠游戏厅里传来阵阵蜂鸣和叫喊声。

Did he not want to spend time with her? She knew he probably didn't. Because of how he saw her. A stupid little girl. She sipped more of her coffee. No, Kaji wasn't like that. So what was wrong with her?  
难道他不想和她共度时光吗？她知道他可能并不想。因为他对她的看法。一个愚蠢的小女孩。她又喝了一口咖啡。不，加持不是那样的人。那么，问题出在她自己身上吗？

Asuka checked her phone, for the eighth time in five minutes, pondering if it might have been better to go out with some of the girls from school. After all, she was, at the moment, the most popular girl in school. Who didn't want to hang out with her? Still, she made sure those opportunities were sparse. Asuka couldn't stand their idle chatter about nothing. About movies and make-up and boys. Especially boys. One boy in particular. Asuka leaned back, a small pocket of fire leaping up her neck.  
明日香再次检查了她的手机，五分钟内已是第八次，思索着是否与学校里的几个女生出去会更好。毕竟，她现在是学校里最受欢迎的女孩。谁不想和她一起出去玩呢？尽管如此，她还是确保这些机会稀少。明日香无法忍受她们关于无关紧要事情的闲聊。关于电影、化妆品和男孩。尤其是男孩。某个特别的男孩。明日香向后靠去，一小簇火焰从她的脖颈窜起。

"Ikari's so dark and brooding, very mysterious."  
“碇真嗣总是那么阴沉和忧郁，非常神秘。”

"He's scary." “他很吓人。”

"But you two look kind of cute together. Always bickering, it's like you're married already!"  
"但你俩站在一起还挺般配的。总是斗嘴，简直像已经结婚了一样！"

Asuka's smile stretched so wide she thought her face might break. "No, we're just friends." She'd said. Except she couldn't even say they were that.  
绫波的笑容拉得那么大，她觉得自己的脸都快裂开了。“不，我们只是朋友。”她曾这么说。只是她连这一点都无法确定。

"_We're friends, right?"_ "我们是朋友，对吧？"

It wasn't the question she wanted to ask – _needed to ask_ – but it was just as important. It meant nothing. It meant everything.  
这不是她想问的——需要问的——但同样重要。它意味着无。它意味着一切。

Even stewing as she was, Asuka saw him approaching a long way off, but pretended not to notice until he was mere feet from the table, glad she was wearing sunglasses.  
即使她心情不佳，明日香远远就看到了他走过来，但还是假装没注意到，直到他离桌子只有几英尺远，庆幸自己戴着太阳镜。

"You're late." “你迟到了。”

Kaji checked his watch, quirking a smile. "You're early."  
加治看了看手表，微微一笑。“你来早了。”

"It isn't polite to keep a lady waiting," she said, fishing in her purse for a small mirror. A great show was made of adjusting her bangs.  
“让女士等待可不礼貌，”她说着，从手提包里掏出一个小镜子，夸张地整理了一下刘海。

"Yes, you're right of course," he said, offering his hand and making a deep bow. She took it and stood, linking her arm through his. She caught him up on all of the latest gossip at school, and the spikes in her sync-rate – even though her median had dipped. She was glad he couldn't see her test results anymore.  
“是的，当然你是对的，”他回答，伸出手并深深鞠了一躬。她握住他的手，站起身来，将手臂挽入他的臂弯。她向他讲述了学校里最新的八卦，以及她的同步率峰值——尽管她的平均值有所下降。她很高兴他再也看不到她的测试结果了。

They arrived at a department store and he held the door open in a grandiose manner. Asuka stepped through with a deliberate, "Thank you."  
他们来到一家百货商店，他以一种夸张的方式把门打开。明日香故意地说了声“谢谢”，然后走了进去。

It was the first time they'd been out together since she'd finished University. He'd made those days in Heidelberg less isolated. Even his apartment had been a sanctuary for her. The room she had at her Aunt and Uncle's was never a welcoming place, adorned with things a childless couple thought a young girl might like. White china with soft pastel flowers and birds. Dresser and bed frame carved with swirling patterns. Austere, stuffy, and otherwise exactly like home – devoid of human touch and color.  
这是她大学毕业后他们第一次一起外出。他在海德堡的那些日子让她不那么孤单。就连他的公寓对她来说也是个避难所。她在姨妈和姨父家的房间从来都不是一个温馨的地方，摆满了无子女夫妇认为年轻女孩可能会喜欢的东西。白色瓷器上绘有柔和的粉彩花朵和鸟类。梳妆台和床架上雕刻着旋涡图案。严肃、沉闷，而且完全像家一样——缺乏人情味和色彩。

Kaji's apartment was a den of collected dysfunction. Everything had a place, but at the same time didn't. An artist's table, used for watercolors, ink, and the occasional calligraphy. The end results littered underneath, curling scraps of paper bent and folding. A coffee table in front of a used couch, one armrest broken, books in varying stages of completion piled atop one another. A bike leaning against the dining room table, which was draped with dress shirts, pants, and several belts.  
加持的公寓是一个充满混乱收藏的巢穴。每样东西都有它的位置，但同时又没有。一张艺术家的桌子，用于水彩画、墨水和偶尔的书法。最终的作品散落在下面，卷曲的纸片弯曲折叠。一张咖啡桌放在一张用过的沙发前，一个扶手坏了，各种阶段的书堆叠在一起。一辆自行车靠在餐厅的桌子上，桌子上铺着衬衫、裤子和几条腰带。

It was a place she didn't have to consider the watchful eyes of her family. Their invasive, but uninterested, inquiries into her studies. She could dress as she pleased, with mostly reasonable exceptions, and do as she pleased. For a time, she even had a copy of the apartment key. It still swung from the school lanyard hanging from her bedroom door.  
这是一个她无需顾虑家人那双双监视的眼睛的地方。他们对她的学业虽有侵扰，却并不真正关心。她可以随心所欲地打扮，只要不过分出格，并随心所欲地行事。有一段时间，她甚至拥有公寓钥匙的副本。那钥匙至今仍挂在她的卧室门上，系在校牌挂绳上轻轻摇晃。

She wanted that again. 她渴望再次拥有那种自由。

Asuka was twisting a top this way and that, trying to imagine how it might look, when he said, "I'm surprised you still want me to shop with you."  
当碇真嗣正左右转动着陀螺，试图想象它的模样时，他说道：“我没想到你还会想让我陪你逛街。”

She spun, clutching the top. "Don't you like to?"  
她转过身，紧抓着上衣。“你不喜欢吗？”

"Sure, Asuka. I just thought you'd rather bring Shinji along." He picked up another article from the same rack and handed it to her.  
“当然，明日香。我只是以为你更想带上真嗣。”他从同一架子上又拿起一件物品递给她。

Asuka couldn't help a sneer as she put it back. "Shinji? He doesn't do this stuff with me. He _wouldn't_ do this stuff with me. I can barely get him to leave his dumb apartment."  
明日香忍不住嗤之以鼻，将那东西放回原处。“真嗣？他不会和我做这些事的。他根本就不会和我做这些事。我几乎没法让他离开他那愚蠢的公寓。”

Kaji wanted to say more, she could see, but not before she harassed him for his opinions on this shirt or that. He gave in, letting her tow him from one end of the store to the other. Asuka put on her best smile. She picked every kind of dress and blouse and shorts she thought he might like on other girls. She made that last as long as she possibly could, but Kaji never did stay as long as she would have liked.  
加治还想说些什么，她看得出来，但还没等他发表对这件衬衫或那件衣服的看法，她就已经开始纠缠他了。他妥协了，任由她拉着他在商店里从一头走到另一头。明日香露出了她最灿烂的笑容。她挑选了各种裙子、衬衫和短裤，都是她认为他可能会喜欢在其他女孩身上看到的款式。她尽可能地延长了这个过程，但加治从未像她希望的那样停留太久。

So it came to an end, and he didn't ask what was wrong despite her silence. Maybe she didn't really want him to.  
于是这一切就这样结束了，尽管她沉默不语，他也没有问她哪里不对劲。也许她并不真的希望他问。

At home, she tore through her wardrobe and scribbled lip-gloss on the mirror before finally going to bed, curled up against the wall. Shinji texted her a few times during the night. Right then, she couldn't bear to see his name.  
回到家后，她翻遍了衣柜，在镜子上胡乱涂了些唇彩，最后蜷缩在墙边入睡。夜里，真嗣给她发了几次短信。那一刻，她实在无法面对他的名字。

The next morning, she walked in with him. He didn't ask where she had been yesterday, or why she hadn't answered his texts. He didn't even ask why her eyelids looked ready to close forever. Maybe that was fine. She wouldn't have talked about it even if he asked. Why should she?  
第二天早上，她和他一起走了进来。他没有问她昨天去了哪里，或者为什么没有回复他的短信。他甚至没有问为什么她的眼皮看起来快要永远闭上了。也许这样也好。即使他问了，她也不会谈论这些。她为什么要谈呢？

Shinji didn't say much to her the rest of the day and that ended up being worse, like when she first came to Tokyo-3. It was her own fault. Again.  
那天剩下的时间里，真嗣对她没怎么说话，这反而更糟糕，就像她刚到第三新东京市时那样。这都是她自己的错。又一次。

That stupid boy. 那个愚蠢的男孩。

She was on cleaning duty, and had told him to just go on without her. For once, he took her up on it and left. Asuka was very busy seething while mopping with a girl whose name she didn't remember, when the Horaki girl – the one that kansai oaf had a crush on – barged into the room.  
她负责打扫卫生，告诉他先走一步。这次他接受了她的提议，离开了。明日香正忙着一边拖地一边生闷气，这时那个关西傻瓜暗恋的堀木女孩闯了进来。

"Soryu, did you hear?" “惣流，你听说了吗？”

"What?" "什么？"

"Suzahara and Ikari got into a fight!"  
“铃原和真嗣打起来了！”

Asuka was upset until she arrived at the nurse's station to see him sitting in the hall with a bandaged eyebrow, knuckles yellow and purple, a few marks on his neck and cheek. He watched her, waiting, and she sighed, taking one of his wrists.  
明日香一直很烦躁，直到她来到护士站，看到他坐在走廊里，眉头包着绷带，拳头上青一块紫一块，脖颈和脸颊上也有几处痕迹。他注视着她，等待着，她叹了口气，握住他的一只手腕。

"Come on, loser." “走吧，失败者。”

When they were off school grounds, she stopped pulling, but held onto his arm until they arrived at his apartment. He sat himself at the kitchen table while she grabbed their medical kit and plied herself to his bruises.  
当他们离开学校范围后，她停止了拉扯，但一直抓着他的手臂，直到他们到达他的公寓。他坐在厨房桌旁，而她拿起医药箱，开始处理他的瘀伤。

Without any of his usual pouting, he allowed her to sterilize, band-aid, and wrap his small spatter of injuries. They were nothing compared to what he used to get.  
他没有像往常那样抱怨，任由她为他消毒、贴上创可贴并包扎那些细小的伤口。与过去所受的伤相比，这些根本不算什么。

"So?" She asked. “所以呢？”她问道。

Shinji's nose wrinkled. He bent to pat the penguin and told her what happened.  
真嗣皱了皱鼻子。他弯腰拍了拍企鹅，然后向她讲述了发生的事情。

Asuka made a face. "Well, he's just some stupid jock, right? Who gives a damn what he thinks."  
明日香做了个鬼脸。“哼，他不就是个愚蠢的运动员吗？谁在乎他怎么想。”

He shook his head, letting the hand she was working on go limp. She wanted to slap him.  
他摇了摇头，任由她正在按摩的手变得无力。她真想扇他一巴掌。

"You're being a baby," she said, pinching him instead.  
“你真是像个小孩子，”她改用捏的，说道。

He stiffened. "I'm not being a baby."  
他僵硬地说：“我不是在耍小孩子脾气。”

"Yes, you are." “你就是。”

His knees bounced side to side and she could feel that he'd rather be anywhere else than sitting with her. The hurt was familiar, but a tiny part of her that was becoming harder to keep buried understood why. They took turns staring at and scratching PenPen.  
他的膝盖不停地左右晃动，她能感觉到他宁愿在任何地方也不愿和她坐在一起。这种伤害她很熟悉，但内心有一小部分正变得越来越难以压抑，她理解其中的原因。他们轮流盯着并挠着 PenPen。

"He said I didn't care about Rei, or Kirishima, or anybody."  
"他说我不在乎丽，或者桐岛，或者任何人。"

"Who's Kirishima?" "桐岛是谁？"

"Long brown hair, wears glasses. I broke her brother's wrist a few months ago."  
"长棕色头发，戴眼镜。几个月前我弄断了她哥哥的手腕。"

"He probably had it coming."  
“他大概是自找的。”

Shinji's head swayed, as if shaking off the idea.  
真嗣的头微微摇晃，仿佛在甩掉这个念头。

Asuka swabbed his jaw and cheek. There was only a bit of broken skin. The question rioting in her throat escaped. "Why do you care so much about Zero anyway?"  
明日香擦拭着他的下巴和脸颊。只有一点擦伤。她喉咙里翻腾的问题脱口而出：“你为什么这么在乎零号机？”

He pretended not to hear that one and she felt her mood sink deeper. She got up and decided she was going to cook something. If he was going to be a jerk to her then she was going to eat his food.  
他假装没听到那句话，她感到心情更加低落。她站起来决定自己要去做点吃的。如果他要对她这么刻薄，那她就吃他的食物。

"Do you think he's right?" Shinji asked.  
“你觉得他说的对吗？” 真嗣问道。

Asuka didn't turn away from priming the rice cooker. "Since when have you cared what I think?"  
明日香没有从准备电饭煲前转身。“你什么时候在乎过我的想法了？”

That shut him up. She didn't feel at all hungry, least of all for rice with curry. All the Japanese ever ate was rice. Shinji had come over to the counter and she turned to lean her back against it, so she could keep him out of her periphery if she wanted.  
这话让他闭嘴了。她一点也不觉得饿，更别提对咖喱饭有什么胃口了。日本人似乎除了米饭什么都不吃。真嗣走到柜台边，她转身背靠上去，这样如果她愿意，就能把他排除在自己的视线之外。

A sigh. "_What_?" 她叹了口气。“怎么了？”

"I think," he said, expression scrunched in thought at the rice cooker. "Maybe I should apologize."  
“我觉得，”他皱着眉头看着电饭煲说，“也许我该道歉。”

She folded her arms. "Do whatever you want."  
她双臂交叉。“随你便。”

He kind of smiled at that, and then decided not to. Sunset was creeping in from the patio windows. The sky was overcast, setting everything in a wash of pale yellow.  
他对此微微一笑，随即决定不笑。夕阳从露台窗户悄悄渗入。天空阴沉，一切都笼罩在一片淡黄色之中。

Shinji traced the mouth of a pot with his finger. "If it was you, would you apologize?"  
真嗣用手指沿着锅口划过。“如果是你，你会道歉吗？”

"Of course not," she said, sparing a moment to follow. She flicked hair out of her face. "But you're not me."  
"当然不会，"她一边说，一边抽空瞥了一眼。她把头发从脸上拂开。"但你不是我。"

He mulled that over for a long time. Long enough for the rice cooker to finish and for her to dump curry sauce atop a bowlful.  
他对此沉思良久。久到电饭煲完成工作，她已经将咖喱酱浇在了一碗饭上。

"I'll do it on Monday."  
"我周一做。"

Asuka shrugged. He'd broken enough promises before. "Whatever. Grab a bowl and eat with me."  
明日香耸了耸肩。他之前已经打破太多承诺了。“随便吧。拿个碗，和我一起吃。”

The blue thumb-drive weighed heavy in her hand, though couldn't have been denser than a tac. Little over a week ago it had appeared in her office, burning a hole in her black desk.  
蓝色的 U 盘在她手中显得沉重，尽管不可能比战术匕首更重。仅仅一周多前，它突然出现在她的办公室里，灼烧着她黑色办公桌的一角。

A dossier: Hanzo Toyotomi. Commander of the Northern Army.  
一份档案：豊臣半藏。北方军指挥官。

A list of summary facts came with the name, none of which stood out in any particular way. He controlled the largest of Japan's five active armies, even with the restructuring after Second Impact. Hokkaido didn't have the same geographic constraints as the rest of the nation, so could house the numbers. It was the same reason the Northern Army was where most of the JSSDF's Type-90 Tank Squadrons called home too.  
附带的名字列表中列出了一些概要事实，但没有一个特别引人注目。他在第二次冲击后的重组中，依然掌控着日本五大现役军队中规模最大的一支。北海道不像国内其他地区那样受到地理限制，因此能够容纳大量兵力。这也是北方军成为日本自卫队 90 式坦克大队多数驻扎地的原因。

Most recently, Toyotomi had been one of the men responsible for orchestrating a chemical attack on an Angel large enough to warrant a UN inquiry.  
最近，丰臣秀吉是策划对一个足以引起联合国调查的大型使徒进行化学攻击的负责人之一。

The elevator doors parted and she closed her fingers around the thumb drive. Beyond was an open office that spanned a wide corridor, slanted windows on one side letting light in.  
电梯门打开，她手指紧握着 U 盘。门外是一个开放式办公室，横跨一条宽阔的走廊，一侧倾斜的窗户透进光线。

Whatever she was meant to see, none of it was clear. Nothing ever was when it came to Kaji. It could only be him, after everything that happened in Lichtenburg. Even now he was scheming, she could see it in his eyes as they caught sight of her across dozens of sparsely populated desks and work stations, he moved out of sight behind a maze of fogged glass partitions that made for meeting rooms. Misato followed, sidestepping an office worker.  
无论她本该看到什么，这一切都不明朗。涉及到加持时，事情总是这样模糊不清。经历了利希滕贝格的一切后，只可能是他。即便现在，他仍在谋划着什么，她能从他的眼神中看出这一点，当他们的目光在稀疏分布的办公桌和工作站间相遇时，他便消失在一排排雾化玻璃隔断后，这些隔断构成了会议室。美里紧随其后，侧身避开了一位办公室职员。

In an alcove on the other side of the partitions, he was giving a great amount of attention to a vending machine. The clacking of her shoes turned him 'round.  
在隔断另一侧的凹室里，他正全神贯注于一台自动售货机。她鞋跟的敲击声让他转过身来。

"Katsuragi–" “葛城——”

"I came to return this to you." She held out the thumb drive.  
"我来还这个给你。" 她递出了 U 盘。

"Whatever do you–" "你到底在搞什么——"

"Cut the crap, Kaji. I'm not playing your little games. I have _real_ work to do."  
"别废话了，加治。我没空陪你玩这些小把戏。我还有正经事要做。"

The man's smile crept ever wider. His hands slid into his pockets.  
男人的笑容逐渐扩大。他的手滑入口袋。

Misato snatched an arm and slapped the thumb-drive into his open palm. He grabbed her hand in his, the thumb drive cocooned between, and pulled her to him. She felt the heat of his breath. Smelled his cologne – scent of fresh-cut wood mixing with cigarettes, sweat, and the sharp sting of dye and formaldehyde in his suit. The top few buttons of his shirt were undone. Fingers rough and familiar over hers.  
美里迅速抓住他的手臂，将 U 盘塞进他摊开的手掌。他紧握住她的手，U 盘夹在两人之间，将她拉近。她感受到他呼吸的热度，闻到他的古龙水——新伐木的香气混杂着烟味、汗水，以及他西装上染料和福尔马林的刺鼻气味。他衬衫最上面的几颗扣子未扣，手指粗糙而熟悉地覆在她的手上。

"You have exactly one second."  
“你只有一秒钟的时间。”

His face came closer. "Or... what?"  
他的脸越来越近。“或者……什么？”

A few things came to mind, but none of them would give her what she wanted. What did she want?  
脑海中闪过几个念头，但没有一个能给她想要的。她到底想要什么？

She planted a hand on his chest. "Stop it."  
她把手放在他的胸口。“别这样。”

Kaji was still, not looking at her, but at her lips. She pursed them, as if to hide. The air between them was warm.  
加治静立不动，目光未曾直视她，而是落在她的唇上。她抿紧双唇，仿佛在隐藏什么。两人之间的空气温暖而微妙。

He let go of her hand and stepped away. "Keep the thumb-drive, Katsuragi," he said, punching in an order at one of the vending machines. Its mechanisms whirred. "And turn on the news once in a while."  
他松开了她的手，向后退去。“留着那 U 盘吧，葛城，”他说着，在一台自动售货机上输入指令。机器内部传来一阵嗡鸣。“还有，偶尔也看看新闻。”

"This isn't like Lichtenberg, Kaji. Whatever you're up to, NERV is going to find out – and I _won't_ be dragged into it."  
“这与利希滕贝格不同，加治。无论你在策划什么，NERV 都会发现的——而我不会被牵扯进去。”

The man just smiled, retrieving his canned coffee.  
那男人只是微笑着，取出了他的罐装咖啡。

Misato went to leave, but turned before she'd taken more than a step. That stupid smile was already digging under her skin. "And another thing: stay away from Shinji."  
美里正要离开，却在迈出一步之前转过身来。那愚蠢的笑容已经让她感到不快。“还有一件事：离真嗣远点。”

Not the least bit startled, Kaji spun and leaned against a vending machine. "Funny, he wants me to stay away from you. I think he's just a little jealous, you know how boys get. Cute, huh?"  
加持丝毫未显惊慌，转身靠在自动售货机上。“真有趣，他让我离你远点。我想他只是有点嫉妒，你知道男孩子就是那样。挺可爱的，不是吗？”

"I'm serious, Kaji." "我是认真的，卡吉。"

"He ran into me, you know."  
"他撞到我了，你知道的。"

"Not according to the report I have."  
"根据我手头的报告，并非如此。"

Kaji's smile went flat and he stood straight. Misato braced herself.  
加持的笑容消失了，他站得笔直。美里做好了准备。

Then he bowed. "Captain, your wish is my command."  
然后他鞠了一躬。“上尉，您的愿望就是我的命令。”

"It wasn't a wish." “那不是愿望。”

"Either way, I'm glad the two of you are getting along – never pegged you as the type for kids, Katsuragi."  
“无论如何，我很高兴你们俩相处得不错——从没想过你会是喜欢孩子的人，葛城。”

And there was his mean side, lurking beneath his smile. Still, he wasn't wrong: she _wasn't_ the type for kids. Training Shinji and Asuka in Lichtenberg, looking after them in afternoons and on summer breaks, had been trying on her nerves more often than not. She was an officer, not a baby sitter.  
他的笑容下隐藏着刻薄的一面。尽管如此，他也没说错：她确实不是那种喜欢孩子的人。在利希滕贝格训练真嗣和明日香，下午和暑假期间照顾他们，这些常常让她感到神经紧绷。她是一名军官，不是保姆。

Thinking back on it, she wouldn't have had it any other way. But he could never know that. Misato didn't give any ground, trying to decipher him. She could never tell what he was thinking.  
回想起来，她并不希望有其他的方式。但他永远不会知道这一点。美里毫不退让，试图解读他的心思。她永远猜不透他在想什么。

Kaji leaned forward. 加治向前倾身。

She pivoted on a heel and left.  
她脚跟一转，离开了。

The sojourn out of Headquarters was a whirlwind of sounds and motion that she navigated without thought. Everything was an ocean of oranges, reds, and pinks.  
离开总部的这段旅程如同旋风般充满声响与动态，她无意识地穿梭其中。一切都是橙色、红色和粉色的海洋。

It was dark by the time she set foot in her apartment, and Misato was glad Asuka wasn't about that night. Shinji was lounging on the futon with PenPen, who appeared to be reading one of the kid's comics with him – if she didn't know any better.  
当她踏进公寓时，天色已暗，Misato 庆幸 Asuka 那晚不在。Shinji 正和 PenPen 一起躺在蒲团上，看起来像是在和他一起看一本儿童漫画——如果她不了解情况的话。

"Hey, whatcha' watchin'?" Even to her, it was the voice of a stranger.  
“嘿，你在看什么？”即便对她自己来说，那声音也显得陌生。

"Nothing special," he said.  
“没什么特别的，”他说。

A nod. "Nothing special, huh?" He'd already turned around by the time she said it. Misato stood there in the plain beiges of her kitchen, colored only by cooking ware and spices and unopened liquor bottles. The light panel above her buzzed, faint, barely discernable over the blare of the TV in their otherwise pitch-black living room.  
她点点头。“没什么特别的，是吧？”她说话时，他已经转过身去。美里站在她那朴素的米色厨房里，只有炊具、香料和未开封的酒瓶点缀着色彩。她头顶的灯光面板嗡嗡作响，微弱得几乎被客厅里电视的喧闹声掩盖，而客厅其他地方则是一片漆黑。

An idea gripped her. 一个念头抓住了她。

"Well, then you can get your shoes on. We're gonna go for a drive."  
“好吧，那你去穿鞋。我们要开车出去兜兜风。”

Shinji turned. "Where to?"  
真嗣转过身。“去哪儿？”

"Somewhere cool, promise," she said, winking. Annoyance quirked his mouth, but he complied anyway.  
“去个凉快的地方，我保证，”她眨了眨眼说。他嘴角微微抽动，有些不悦，但还是顺从了。

The streets were noisy with Tokyo-3's dense workforce spilling out of its offices and skyscrapers, but became quieter as she took them around Lake Ashi. At the tiny town of Hakonemachi she stopped in at a grocer and bought three items – the fattest watermelon she could find, a knife, and a six-pack of Sapporo beer. Shinji watched with curious eyes, suspicious even, as she strode out with her purchase.  
东京-3 密集的劳动力使得街道上喧嚣不已，人们从办公室和摩天大楼中涌出，但随着她带他绕过芦之湖，四周逐渐安静下来。在箱根町这个小城镇，她停在一个杂货店前，买了三样东西——她能找到的最肥大的西瓜、一把刀和一打札幌啤酒。真嗣好奇地看着，甚至有些怀疑，她带着买的东西大步走了出来。

From there they wound down the slopes of the caldera until they were skimming along the hills of Izu, a sparsely populated place even before Second Impact. Now no one lived there, least of all on the water's edge where the swallowed towns were making fine new reefs.  
从那里，他们蜿蜒下到火山口的斜坡，直到沿着伊豆的山丘滑行，那里在第二次冲击之前人口就已稀少。如今无人居住，尤其在水边，那些被吞噬的城镇正形成美丽的新礁石。

Misato followed the road until it met the sea. Crooked street lights stuck out of the waters. Dead mandarin trees peppered the new beachline, their branches barren and brittle-white.  
美里沿着道路一直走到海边。弯曲的路灯从水中伸出。死去的柑橘树点缀着新的海滩线，它们的枝条光秃秃的，苍白而脆弱。

"Yeah, this is a good spot." Letting the car run, she left the lights on and turned the radio up. A question paced in Shinji's expression, but he followed her out.  
“是啊，这里是个好地方。”她让车继续行驶，开着车灯并调高了收音机音量。真嗣的表情中带着疑问，但他还是跟着她下了车。

She had him comb the old mandarin grove with her for kindling, the wash of the waves drowning out the sound of breaking branches. They met back at the road, he with an armful of wood and she with an assortment of brush. They made two more such trips, stripping the nearest trees bare. Dried fingers reaching out of the sand.  
她让他和她一起在老文官的果园里捡拾柴火，海浪的冲刷声淹没了折断树枝的声响。他们在路上汇合，他抱着一捆木头，而她则拿着各式各样的灌木。他们又往返了两次，将最近的树木剥得光秃秃的。干枯的手指从沙中伸出。

"There's an art to building bon fires," she said, making a ring from loose chunks of asphalt at the crumbling edges of the road. He watched as their fire took shape, pieces of wood inspected and tested for moisture before being set over their kindling. With the lighter from her back pocket, it took several minutes for it to catch, Shinji cupping his hands around the tiny flame to keep the coastal breeze from blowing it out.  
“生篝火可是一门艺术，”她说着，用松散的沥青块在道路破损的边缘围成一个圈。他看着篝火逐渐成型，木块被检查并测试湿度后才放置在柴火上。她从后口袋掏出打火机，花了好几分钟才点燃，真嗣用手掌护住微弱的火苗，以防海风将其吹灭。

Fire erupted in short order, eager to taste the dead wood.  
火很快便熊熊燃烧起来，迫不及待地吞噬着枯木。

They sat on the cracked road, which still held the day's warmth. Misato kicked off her shoes, stockings scuffing at the heels. Dragging the six-pack closer, she cracked one of the yellow cans open and took a long draw. The taste was thin and fizzy, but entirely nostalgic. With it came nights full of shitty beer and burning rum, blazing heat and sand between her toes. Melon juice and being wrapped in his arms.  
他们坐在裂开的路面上，那里还残留着白天的余温。美里踢掉了鞋子，袜跟在脚后跟处磨蹭。她把六罐啤酒拉近，打开了一罐黄色的，深深地喝了一口。味道虽淡且带气泡，却满是怀旧之情。随之而来的是充满劣质啤酒和燃烧朗姆酒的夜晚，炽热如火，沙粒夹在脚趾间。还有西瓜汁和她被他拥入怀中的感觉。

Shinji was staring off into the ocean until she poked his elbow with a beer, still cold – giggling when his face twisted after the first sip. The boy tried his best to match her pace and finish the rest.  
真嗣一直凝视着大海，直到她用一罐冰啤酒戳了戳他的手肘，他第一次尝试时脸上的扭曲让她忍不住笑出声来。男孩尽力跟上她的节奏，努力喝完剩下的啤酒。

After making a good start on her second beer, she set a towel between them and cut into their watermelon. It split with a wet crack and she sliced with practiced ease. She hadn't been able to cut a straight line to save her life the first time, and Ritsuko had fallen into a fit of laughter trying to eat the haphazard pieces as it fell apart in her hands.  
在她喝完第二罐啤酒后，美里在他们之间铺了一条毛巾，开始切西瓜。西瓜裂开时发出湿润的声音，她熟练地切着。第一次尝试时，她连一条直线都切不出来，而律子则笑得前仰后合，试图吃掉那些在她手中散落的不规则块状西瓜。

The cuts she made now were tidy and efficient. For a while, crunching and intermittent sips accompanied the snaps of fire and distant voice of the radio.  
她现在切的每一刀都干净利落。一时间，咔嚓声、间歇的啜饮声与篝火的噼啪声和远处电台的说话声交织在一起。

"Good?" She asked. “好吃吗？”她问道。

Shinji nodded, juice spilling from a corner of his mouth. Misato smiled, sharing beachside memories with him – like the time Kaji's car got them stuck in the mud after a rainy night back home, or the when he had raced locals down the tight, twisting mountainside roads, laughing away her shrieking protests.  
真嗣点点头，果汁从嘴角溢出。美里微笑着，与他分享海边的回忆——比如那个雨夜后，加持的车让他们陷在泥泞中，或是他曾在蜿蜒曲折的山路上与当地人竞速，笑声淹没了她尖叫的抗议。

"So that's why you drive like a maniac," Shinji said.  
“所以这就是你开车像疯子的原因。”真嗣说道。

Misato tugged his ear until he apologized. As the fire cackled, amused, she stole a few glances his way, wondering if she should say it – because he was changing in front of her again, and it seemed, however minor, for the better.  
美里拽着他的耳朵直到他道歉。火堆噼啪作响，她偷瞄了他几眼，犹豫是否该说出口——因为他又在她的眼前发生了变化，尽管微小，但似乎是向好的方向。

She let it sit a while longer. "Listen, I know you two don't always get along, but... I'm glad Asuka is here with you."  
她又让它悬了一会儿。“听着，我知道你们俩并不总是相处得很好，但是……我很高兴明日香和你在一起。”

Shinji shrugged, swimming in more than he wanted to say out loud, and she let him keep that. A pile of discarded fruit skin was all that remained of the watermelon.  
真嗣耸了耸肩，心中所想远超他愿意大声说出的，而她让他保留了这份沉默。一堆被丢弃的果皮，便是西瓜仅存的痕迹。

"Misato..." he said, the lapse that followed lasting long enough for them to slip into the rhythm of the water again, but she waited, listening.  
“美里……”他开口道，随后的停顿久到足以让他们再次融入水流的节奏中，但她耐心等待，倾听着。

"Misato, why do you hate Kaji so much?"  
“美里，你为什么这么讨厌加持呢？”

Waves murmured, dune grass whispering in the wind.  
波浪低语，沙丘草在风中轻声细语。

"That's just it, kiddo. I don't," she said, twirling a small stick in her fingers before tossing it in the fire. The twig bounced off to the side.  
"问题就在这儿，孩子。我不懂，" 她一边说，一边用手指旋转着一根小树枝，然后扔进火里。树枝弹到一旁。

"I don't understand." "我不明白。"

She smiled, looking at him, then leaned back on her hands. Above, they could see just about every star in the sky, save for a dark, shifting spot. "Sometimes being close to people you might really care about is... sometimes it's better to stay away."  
她微笑着，看着他，然后双手向后撑着身体。上方，他们几乎能看到天空中所有的星星，除了一个黑暗、移动的斑点。“有时候，接近那些你可能会真正关心的人是……有时候，保持距离更好。”

The beach breathed in and out.  
海滩一呼一吸。

"That sounds really lonely, Misato."  
“那听起来真的很孤独，美里。”

She hummed, entertaining different bonfires on different beaches. Sliding a hand into his hair, she ruffled it with such force he tumbled over. It made her smile again when he grimaced and picked himself up.  
她轻哼着曲子，脑海中浮现出不同海滩上不同篝火的景象。她伸手滑入他的发间，用力揉乱，以至于他一个趔趄摔倒了。看到他皱眉爬起来的样子，她又笑了。

"Part of growing up is being a little lonely every now and then. We all just have to learn how to deal with it."  
成长的一部分，就是时不时会感到些许孤独。我们都得学会如何应对。

Fading heat from the pavement seeped into her hands. Embers floated up to join the night sky, while the stereo behind them sang about a girl named Jody.  
人行道上残留的热气渗透进她的双手。余烬飘升，融入夜空，而他们身后的音响正唱着一个叫乔迪的女孩的故事。

---

A knife in the gut might have been better than this – and he'd been stabbed before. Or his Eva had. The ghost-pains made it real enough that there was little distinction.  
一刀捅在肚子上或许都比这好受——他以前被刺伤过，或者说他的 Eva 被刺伤过。那些幽灵般的疼痛足以让他觉得真切，以至于两者间的区别变得微乎其微。

Shinji compressed the urge to look back at Asuka down the hall, focusing instead on the door to their homeroom. Through its window, he could see the students assigned to cleaning duty, shuffling tables and sweeping corners. Toji wasn't in a bad way, not like Shinji had done to others, but he'd be sporting some black bruises for a while. Another pull of guilt yanked him.  
真嗣压抑住回头看向走廊另一端明日香的冲动，转而专注于他们班级的教室门。透过窗户，他能看到被分配到打扫任务的学生们，正挪动着桌子和清扫角落。阿薰的情况并不糟糕，不像真嗣对别人造成的那种伤害，但他身上将会留下一些淤青。这份愧疚感再次拉扯着他。

Shinji turned away as the boy's eyes caught him. Exasperation dripped from Asuka's posture, and she made a loud sigh.  
当那男孩的目光捕捉到他时，真嗣转过身去。明日香的不耐烦从她的姿态中溢出，她重重地叹了口气。

"If you're going to apologize, just do it," she said, pushing off the wall to walk with him. "I don't get what you're sorry for anyway."  
"如果你要道歉，就干脆点，" 她从墙边站起身，与他一同走去。"反正我也不明白你在为什么道歉。"

The further away they got, the more Shinji's realized how hard he was trembling. "If it's so easy, how come you've never apologized for anything?"  
他们越走越远，真嗣越发意识到自己颤抖得有多厉害。"如果道歉这么简单，你怎么从来没为任何事道过歉？"

"What do I have to apologize for?" There was a dangerous quality to the question, and a lance played on the tip of is tongue.  
"我有什么好道歉的？" 这个问题带着一丝危险的气息，一抹锋芒在他舌尖游走。

"Nothing, I guess." “没什么，我想。”

It was later in the day when they were beyond the caldera again, in open grass fields that had once been homes. The tall stalks cracked with each step, wind moving through it like a current and sending shivers down his arms and legs. Cicadas chirped in the fading heat of the day.  
当他们再次越过破火山口，来到曾经是家园的广阔草地时，已是傍晚时分。每走一步，高高的草茎都会发出断裂声，风在其中穿梭，如同水流一般，让他手臂和双腿感到一阵阵颤栗。蝉鸣在日渐消退的热气中回响。

Asuka led them, having changed into a longer skirt and ruffled collar top, speckled with tiny polka dots.  
明日香带领着他们，换上了一条更长的裙子和带有褶边的衣领上衣，上面点缀着细小的波点。

For Shinji, untucking his shirt sufficed.  
对真嗣来说，把衬衫下摆拉出来就足够了。

Coming out here after school hadn't been a conversation, but a pull. Neither wanted to go home to a dense and dark apartment, and neither wanted to be anywhere else. An old sensation took him as they rode the trains and buses out, walking him through the Langley garden again to meet by the olive tree. Asuka talked most of the way. It was familiar and made him feel as though he could look outside and see Berlin passing by, its cityscape giving way to the countryside.  
放学后来到这里并非经过讨论，而是自然而然的吸引。两人都不想回到那个昏暗拥挤的公寓，也不想待在其他任何地方。当他们乘坐火车和公交车外出时，一种熟悉的感觉涌上心头，仿佛再次漫步在兰利花园，相约在那棵橄榄树下。一路上，明日香大部分时间都在说话。这让他感到熟悉，仿佛向外望去就能看到柏林的街景，城市逐渐让位于乡村。

Now, she was quiet. As quiet as a girl like Asuka was capable of being when not wound in schoolwork or television romance. A melody hummed from her throat as they went, though he couldn't place the tune.  
现在，她安静了下来。像明日香这样的女孩，在没有沉浸在学业或电视爱情剧中时，能如此安静实属难得。她哼着一首旋律，尽管他无法辨认出曲调。

It wasn't until they came across a building at the fringes of the flood zone, having been moved off its foundation, that Asuka stopped. Half of it sagged, a tear splitting down the middle. She scanned their surroundings, finding little else except decaying refuse where there had once been hordes of homes and businesses.  
直到他们来到洪水区边缘的一栋建筑前，这栋建筑已被移离地基，明日香才停下脚步。它的一半倾斜着，中间裂开一道口子。她环顾四周，除了曾经是成群住宅和商业区的地方现在只剩下腐烂的垃圾，几乎没有其他发现。

"We should see if we can rebuild one of these houses."  
“我们应该看看能不能重建其中一栋房子。”

Shinji looked up from where he was nudging an old sign. "Why?"  
真嗣从他正在拨弄一块旧招牌的地方抬起头来。“为什么？”

"You got something better to do?" She asked, at first incredulous. Then her hands knit behind her back and she leaned closer. "Maybe another hot date with Misatooo?"  
"你有更好的事做吗？" 她起初难以置信地问。随后，她的双手交叠在背后，身体微微前倾。"或许又是一场与 Misato 的热辣约会？"

"It wasn't a date! I just don't see the point."  
"那不是约会！我只是觉得没意义。"

"_Classic_." She shifted her weight and crossed her arms. "You don't see past your own navel, let alone the point in anything. Now shut up and let's look for a good spot to start."  
"经典。" 她换了下重心，双臂交叉。"你连自己的肚脐眼都看不透，更别提任何事情的意义了。现在闭嘴，我们找个好地方开始吧。"

Shinji scowled and she stuck her tongue out for good measure.  
真嗣皱了皱眉，她也顺势吐了吐舌头。

They surveyed each foundation, discussing the pros and cons, until arriving at the platform they had thrown rocks from days before.  
他们逐一考察了每个地基，讨论着各自的优缺点，直到来到几天前他们扔过石头的那块平台。

"This is perfect," Asuka said, and that was that.  
“这里很完美，”明日香说道，事情就这样定了。

They gathered whatever was salvageable: loose bricks, old rebar, plywood, two-by-fours, and plastic crates. Asuka came up with a list of tools and materials, and then the problem of how they would get it all there came up. Not only that, but how to store it onsite and keep it safe from the weather. Then they started arguing about how long it would take with just the two of them.  
他们收集了所有可用的东西：散落的砖块、旧钢筋、胶合板、二乘四的木条和塑料箱。明日香列出了一份工具和材料的清单，紧接着问题就来了，他们如何将这些东西全部运到那里。不仅如此，还有如何在工地上储存并保护它们免受天气影响。随后，他们开始争论仅凭两人需要多长时间才能完成。

Quickly, the idea became complex and unfathomable. Asuka sat on the ledge and kicked her feet, while he faced away and paced, each waiting for the coals of their argument to cool.  
很快，这个想法变得复杂且难以理解。明日香坐在窗台上晃着脚，而他则背对着她踱步，两人都在等待争论的余温冷却。

Asuka turned. "Well, we don't need to build an actual stupid house – we'll just make do with what's here."  
明日香转过身来。“好吧，我们不需要真的建一个愚蠢的房子——我们就利用现有的东西凑合一下。”

So, they set about the task of making, well, whatever they could.  
于是，他们开始着手制作，嗯，能做出来的任何东西。

Taking off his school shirt for the plain sleeveless underneath, he yanked beams out from under collapsed rooves, scraping his arms, and dirtying his trousers liberating intact blocks of cinder. Asuka freed smaller, more manageable pieces of wood, prying nails free with a rusty hammer.  
他脱下校服衬衫，露出里面的无袖背心，从倒塌的屋顶下拽出横梁，手臂被刮伤，裤子也因为解放完好的煤渣块而弄脏。明日香则解放了更小、更易处理的木块，用一把生锈的锤子拔出钉子。

When they had a pile going – dragged, hauled, and sometimes team carried up to their hillside villa – they both realized they still didn't have a layout. Taking a receipt from his pocket, Shinji drew schematics on the thermal paper with a spare coin, changing them to the rapid demands of his architect.  
当他们堆起一堆东西——拖拽、搬运，有时是团队合作搬到山坡上的别墅——两人都意识到他们仍然没有布局。从口袋里拿出一张收据，真嗣用一枚备用硬币在热敏纸上绘制草图，根据他建筑师的快速要求不断修改。

There would be an open veranda shielded by an awning facing the sea and overlooking the hills. The entryway to it would by wide, a flat wall facing the south, where there would be a staircase leading to the second floor. To the north east would be the kitchen area, or at least something resembling one. He talked about bringing a portable stove and other things to make meals. After losing a bout of rock-paper-scissors, he also agreed to pay for the food.  
将有一个面向大海、俯瞰山丘的开放式阳台，由遮阳篷保护。通往阳台的入口宽敞，南面是一堵平墙，那里有一道通往二楼的楼梯。东北方向将是厨房区域，或者至少类似的东西。他谈到了带一个便携式炉子和其他东西来做饭。在一场石头剪刀布的比赛中失利后，他还同意支付食物费用。

In the largest part of the foundation, facing the north, would be the tatami room, or the living room. Asuka was confident they could find furniture somewhere, and that they could clean it up enough to be useable. He didn't think so, but didn't want to dampen her spirits any further after their earlier disappointment.  
在基础部分最大的区域，面向北方，将是榻榻米房间，或者说客厅。明日香自信他们能在某处找到家具，并且可以清理到足够使用的程度。他不这么认为，但不想在他们之前的失望之后再打击她的士气。

Now with a plan and a haphazard array of materials, the sky beginning to melt gold, they started to build a home.  
此刻有了计划和一堆杂乱无章的材料，天空开始泛起金色的霞光，他们着手建造一个家。

Cinder blocks, which they had more of than anything else, came first to build the southside wall. They didn't have concrete, but could probably use dirt to fill the hollows and make it heavy enough not to wedge loose. Next time he would have to bring a shovel. Asuka started on a frame for the stairs with their array of two-by-fours and rusty nails.  
首先用的是混凝土块，这是他们最多的材料，用来建造南侧的墙。他们没有混凝土，但可以用泥土填充空心部分，使其足够沉重而不易松动。下次他得带把铲子。明日香开始用他们的两英寸乘四英寸木板和生锈的钉子搭建楼梯框架。

Air moved in gentle gusts, cooling the sweat beading on his arms and neck. Shinji was on the opposite side of the wall, now about as tall as him, when he realized the clangs of her hammer had stopped. Pausing, he listened. There wasn't anything, not the shuffle of wood or jingling nails, but he could feel her there. A dog barked far off. Clothing rustled.  
微风轻轻吹拂，冷却了他手臂和脖子上渗出的汗水。真嗣在墙的另一边，现在墙已经和他一样高了，这时他意识到她的锤子敲击声停止了。他停下手中的活，倾听着。没有任何声音，没有木头的摩擦声或钉子的叮当声，但他能感觉到她在那里。远处传来狗的吠叫声。衣服摩擦的声音。

He poked his head around the wall, finding her crouched with her back against it. Their shoulders touched as he settled next to her. She didn't move away.  
他探头从墙边望去，发现她正蜷缩着背靠在墙上。他坐到她旁边，两人的肩膀相触，她没有挪开。

Asuka watched the fields and their forgotten pieces of wreckage. "I don't think we're going to be able to build a second story," she said. Her elbow rested on a knee; chin cupped in one hand – hiding the half of her face he could see.  
明日香望着田野和那些被遗忘的残骸。“我觉得我们盖不了二层楼了，”她说道。她的手肘支在膝盖上，一手托着下巴——遮住了他能看到的那半边脸。

Shinji pinched her arm. 真嗣捏了捏她的手臂。

He got the reaction he wanted – an annoyed one – as she jerked, face twisting at his smirk.  
他得到了他想要的反应——一个恼怒的反应——她猛地一颤，面对他的得意笑容，脸上表情扭曲。

"We'll make one," he said.  
“我们会造一个，”他说。

Turning back to the fields, grass rising and falling, a smile touched her lips. A small one. A real one.  
她转回向着田野，草浪起伏，一丝微笑触动了她的唇。一个微小的。一个真心的微笑。

The house was coming along nicely.  
房子建得相当不错。

Glancing skyward, he caught a faint shadow creeping into view along the arc of evening. A dark stain that spread a little more every day.  
他抬头望向天空，捕捉到一抹淡淡的阴影正沿着夜幕的弧线悄然显现。那是一片日益蔓延的暗斑。

Tokyo-3 was heavy with night by the time they made it back into the city proper and Asuka wanted to go out. He fought it, wanting to be home, but lost the instant a karaoke bar crossed their path and Asuka walked in to pay for a room. Sitting in the booth along the wall while she took up the microphone and swayed, waiting for her line-up of songs to start, he was content to watch until she offered to pay him 1,000 yen if he could sing _Plastic Love_ in English. Even said she would sing it with him.  
当他们终于回到东京第三区市区时，夜色已浓，明日香却想出去玩。他本想回家，但一看到卡拉 OK 酒吧，明日香就径直走了进去订了个房间。他坐在墙边的卡座里，看着她拿起麦克风摇摆着等待歌曲轮到她，心里感到满足。直到她提出如果他能用英语唱《塑料之恋》，就付给他 1000 日元，甚至还说会和他一起唱。

It wasn't a bet he could win, mostly since neither could help but laugh every other verse. He could pronounce English well enough, but it was knowing all the words that was the problem.  
这并非一场他能赢的赌局，主要是因为他们每唱几句就忍不住笑出声来。他的英语发音还算标准，但问题在于记不住所有的歌词。

"I could sing it in German!" He said between fits of laughter, making Asuka's giggles louder.  
“我可以用德语唱！”他在一阵阵笑声中说道，这让明日香也笑得更欢了。

When they grew tired of that, he took her to a bar Misato, Ritsuko, and some of the bridge crew used to frequent. The owner was a muscular woman who let him call her Chitoge and preferred to have her hair dyed blonde ever since she'd been a wrestler in college. He found the smell of marlboros and the oak floorboards under his feet comforting. They smelled of Bernau. Sodden wood and misty mornings.  
当他们厌倦了这个游戏后，他带她去了米萨托、律子和一些舰桥人员常去的酒吧。老板是一位肌肉发达的女性，允许他称她为千岁，自从大学时当过摔跤手后，她就一直喜欢把头发染成金色。他觉得万宝路香烟的味道和脚下的橡木地板令人安心，这些气味让他想起了伯尔瑙，潮湿的木头和雾蒙蒙的早晨。

He and Asuka went to the pool tables and argued over rules and which game to play. Aoba had taught him whenever he was sober enough, or even when he wasn't, while she'd learned from a college girl with hair to her knees, and there seemed to be discrepancy. When they finally agreed on nine-ball, and a bet, Chitoge sat atop the adjacent table to watch, bud smoldering at her lips. Asuka won the first few easy-going games, and then he became serious, and won the next set. Which meant she paid.  
他和明日香走到台球桌前，争论着规则和该玩哪种游戏。青叶在他清醒时教过他，甚至在他不清醒时也教过，而明日香则是从一个长发及膝的大学女生那里学来的，似乎存在一些差异。当他们最终达成一致，决定玩九球并下注时，千棘坐在旁边的桌子上观看，嘴里的烟头冒着烟。明日香轻松赢了前几局，然后他认真起来，赢得了接下来的几局。这意味着她得付账。

Chitoge laughed. 千棘笑了。

Shinji and Asuka are the anime characters that have awakened me the most sorrow and sympathy.
真嗣和明日香是最让我感到悲伤和同情的动漫人物。
Their traumas as toddlers were terrible events that left their deep scars indeed, but it was their next 10 years of loneliness and isolation during their childhoods until they met in the series, the experience that left them permanently warped and hurled them down a slippery slope into the abyss that was EoE.
他们蹒跚学步时的创伤是可怕的事件，确实给他们留下了深深的伤痕，但这是他们童年时期接下来的 10 年孤独和孤立，直到他们在系列中相遇，这段经历让他们永久扭曲并将他们扔下滑坡，进入 EoE 的深渊。

Asuka ended her childhood at four by deciding to act as an independent adult, a fact that, added to her father's neglect and the lack of bonding with her stepmother, deprived her of any reference to early socialization and basic manners.
明日香在四岁时决定成为一个独立的成年人，这一事实加上她父亲的忽视和与继母缺乏联系，剥夺了她对早期社会化和基本礼仪的任何提及。

And if it is already unrealistic to expect a girl who does not connect with her own parents to make friends her own age, it is even more difficult if she is a prodigy, since she would in no way identify with children less intelligent than her, whom she would also not see much since she constantly skipped grades.
如果指望一个不与自己父母联系的女孩结交同龄的朋友已经是不现实的，那么如果她是神童就更难了，因为她绝不会认同比她聪明的孩子，因为她经常跳级，她也不会看到太多。

And if we add the fact that she was designated as Eva's pilot, and that she had no contact with the other children at Gehrin headquarters, we already have the recipe to create the insecure, proud, self-centered and arrogant girl that we saw throughout the series.
如果我们加上她被指定为伊娃的飞行员，并且她与盖林总部的其他孩子没有联系，我们已经有了创造我们在整个系列中看到的不安全、骄傲、以自我为中心和傲慢的女孩的秘诀。

It always seemed to me that Asuka had an incredibly unfair and tragic end, because all her sacrifices, sufferings, efforts, successes and achievements of her 14 years of life came to nothing in NGE.
在我看来，明日香的结局总是非常不公平和悲惨，因为她 14 年生活中的所有牺牲、痛苦、努力、成功和成就在 NGE 中都化为乌有。

Her hard training as Eva was useless against the Angels, she also failed to be noticed and admired (she was detested and kept at a distance), much less loved and bonded.
她作为伊娃的艰苦训练对天使毫无用处，她也没有被注意到和钦佩（她被憎恶并保持距离），更不用说被爱和束缚了。

Not only did her trauma with her mother not heal, but she was added to a much worse trauma, now she has to live the rest of her life with the realization that she pushed people out of her life, her horrible experience as a pilot and worst of all, only her relationship with Shinji remains, now stained with regret, abandonment, resentment, pain and fear.
她与母亲的创伤不仅没有愈合，而且她遭受了更严重的创伤，现在她不得不度过余生，意识到她把人们赶出了她的生活，她作为飞行员的可怕经历，最糟糕的是，只剩下她与真嗣的关系， 现在沾满了遗憾、抛弃、怨恨、痛苦和恐惧。

As for Shinji, how do I explain it all? Poor underdog looks as if he was born unlucky, as if the whole damn universe was out to bring him down and make his life miserable.
至于真嗣，我该怎么解释呢？可怜的失败者看起来好像他生来就不走运，好像整个该死的宇宙都在把他打倒，让他的生活变得悲惨。
It's not just that Gendo put Shinji in an Eva to fight an angel when he hadn't even seen these things even in pictures, but he also didn't have any combat training and wasn't in good physical shape either.
不仅仅是源道让真嗣在连照片上都没见过这些东西的时候就把真嗣放在伊娃身上与天使战斗，而且他也没有接受过任何战斗训练，身体状况也不好。
Hell, Shinji had been abandoned with his father and cared for by a sensei who raised him like a dog, only teaching him to obey orders, do chores and play a cello.
见鬼，真嗣被父亲遗弃了，由一位老师照顾，老师把他像狗一样抚养长大，只教他服从命令、做家务和拉大提琴。
He was qualified to be service personnel at best, there was no way he would fit in with the military.
他充其量只能当军人，他不可能适应军队。
God damn it, he couldn't even stand up straight, he was doubtful, dependent, introverted, skittish, lacking self esteem, lacking in determination, apathetic and passive.
该死的，他连站直都站不起来，他多疑、依赖、内向、易怒、缺乏自尊、缺乏决心、冷漠和被动。

And his father and the other cold-hearted NERV fools intended him to behave like the confident and fearless protagonist of a shonen manga under these circumstances.
在这种情况下，他的父亲和其他冷酷无情的 NERV 傻瓜希望他表现得像少年漫画中自信无畏的主角。

It didn't matter shit that he was naturally talented or that he managed to defeat angels, if he didn't have any previous damn experience or physical or mental preparation for it he was going to hate the damn job even getting a 10.
不管他天生有天赋，或者他设法打败了天使，如果他之前没有任何该死的经验或身体或心理准备，他就会讨厌这份该死的工作，即使得到 10 分。

And it pisses me off how Misato, a woman in a masculine setting and unladylike demeanor has the callousness to respond to Shinji's obvious difficulties in fulfilling the stereotypical male hero role with this stellar question: Otoko no ko desho? (Aren't you a boy?).
让我生气的是，美里，一个处于男性化环境和不淑女举止的女人，竟然冷酷无情地回应真嗣在履行刻板的男性英雄角色方面的明显困难，并提出了这个出色的问题：Otoko no ko desho？（你不是男孩吗？

But if this didn't suck enough, Misato decided to emulate Zeus and brought Pandora with her box of curses into Shinji's life in the form of Asuka Langley Soryu.
但如果这还不够糟糕，美里决定效仿宙斯，以明日香兰利苍龙的形式将潘多拉和她的诅咒盒带入真嗣的生活。
And my God, Shinji looked even more pathetic in front of that redhead than Ron Stoppable in front of Kim Possible.
我的上帝，真嗣在那个红发女郎面前看起来比在金可能面前的罗恩·斯托普布尔还要可怜。
Seriously, she has everything he lacked; beauty, intelligence, strength, combat training, courage, determination, initiative and self-confidence.
说真的，她拥有他所缺乏的一切;美丽、智慧、力量、战斗训练、勇气、决心、主动性和自信。
And she did not hesitate to constantly point out which of the two was wearing the pants.
她毫不犹豫地不断指出两人中谁穿着裤子。

On top of that she had trained ten years to do what Shinji achieved by chance, so the only remarkable ability the poor thing had became a source of conflict, since the badass girl couldn't understand how such a pussy could surpass her and got jealous.
最重要的是，她已经训练了十年才能做到真嗣偶然取得的成就，所以唯一非凡的能力这个可怜的东西已经成为冲突的根源，因为坏女孩无法理解这样的猫怎么能超过她并嫉妒。
And to put the icing on the cake, both end up developing an attraction that could never end well for both of them.
锦上添花的是，两人最终都发展出一种对他们俩来说永远不会有好结果的吸引力。
Shinji was too passive and meek to make a move towards a girl who humiliated and mistreated him continuously and too dense to take her hints.
真嗣太被动和温顺了，无法对一个不断羞辱和虐待他的女孩采取行动，而且太密集而无法接受她的暗示。

Asuka was too domineering, cheeky, and insecure to confess her feelings in a straight way to him without insinuating him with her body or forcefully kissing him out of the blue.
明日香太霸道、厚颜无耻、缺乏安全感，无法直接向他表白自己的感情，而不会用身体暗示他或突然强行亲吻他。

Can anyone blame the poor wretch for what he did in EoE? I would have wanted every damn person in the world to die with glee if he were in his place. Fuck everything, just return to nothing and disappear so I can finally live in peace.
谁能责怪这个可怜的坏蛋在 EoE 中的所作所为？如果他在他的位置上，我会希望世界上每个该死的人都能高兴地死去。去他妈的一切，回到虚无，消失，这样我终于可以平静地生活了。

Let's be honest, Gendo here is 100 times a better person and with more common sense when sending Shinji to Germany.
老实说，这里的源堂在将真嗣送到德国时是一个更好的人 100 倍，并且有更多的常识。
Being sent abroad and raised by some strangers is a harsh experience for a child, but at least there are rewards at the end of the dark road.
被送到国外，被一些陌生人抚养长大，对于一个孩子来说，是一种残酷的经历，但至少在黑暗之路的尽头有回报。
Shinji is raised outside of the conformist, collectivist and submissive culture of the Japanese and learns to act as an independent individual in Western society.
真嗣在日本的墨守成规、集体主义和顺从文化之外长大，并学会了在西方社会中作为一个独立的个体行事。
Who gives a shit that he never fits into tiny Japan, as long as he has the tools to have a life in the EU and America, where people don't bow, apologize and beat around the bush.
谁在乎他永远不适合小日本，只要他有工具在欧盟和美国生活，那里的人们不会鞠躬、道歉和拐弯抹角。

Asuka here is the best friend and life teacher he could have wished for. She competes in a healthy way with him to motivate him to break out of his bubble of mediocrity, loneliness and passivity and aspire to be the best for his own pride and self-esteem, not because adults tell him to do it.
这里的明日香是他所希望的最好的朋友和生活老师。她以健康的方式与他竞争，以激励他打破平庸、孤独和被动的泡沫，渴望成为最好的自己的骄傲和自尊，而不是因为大人告诉他这样做。

Asuka being the energetic and badass girl that we love wrestles with the boy and teaches him not to take shit from anyone. She teaches him to be a man and he applies that lesson at school, where he learns to punch back at his bullies.
明日香是我们喜欢的精力充沛的坏蛋女孩，她与男孩摔跤并教他不要从任何人那里拉屎。她教他做一个男人，他把这个教训应用到学校，在那里他学会了回击他的欺凌者。

As a gender equality advocate, I think if Shinji and Asuka had addressed their misunderstandings and frustrations with each other with wrestling they would have been able to connect much better and vent a lot of stress.
作为性别平等的倡导者，我认为如果真嗣和明日香通过摔跤解决了彼此之间的误解和挫败感，他们将能够更好地联系并发泄很多压力。

Little Asuka can be pretty nasty and violent, but dealing with her is the bitter medicine Shinji needs to grow a spine. There are people in this world who will not leave you alone just because you are kind and polite, you have to learn to defend yourself.
小明日香可能非常讨厌和暴力，但与她打交道是真嗣长出脊椎所需的苦药。这个世界上有些人不会因为你善良有礼貌而让你一个人呆着，你必须学会保护自己。

Shinji not only becomes physically and mentally stronger, but also more intelligent and suspicious thanks to our beloved redhead. He learns European languages and numerous subjects at school with her and acquires competencies to be able to... well, live as an independent person in society.
真嗣不仅在身体和精神上变得更强壮，而且由于我们心爱的红发女郎，他变得更加聪明和多疑。他和她一起在学校学习欧洲语言和许多科目，并获得了能够...好吧，在社会上作为一个独立的人生活。

I love Shinji's interactions at school, since he begins to meet other children besides the redhead and joins the soccer team on Asuka's recommendation, where he can form his first friendships. Without a doubt, he has it easier in Germany than in Japan, since Westerners are more direct and have no problem letting him know if they like him or not.
我喜欢真嗣在学校的互动，因为他开始结识红发以外的其他孩子，并在明日香的推荐下加入了足球队，在那里他可以结交他的第一个朋友。毫无疑问，他在德国比在日本更容易，因为西方人更直接，让他知道他们是否喜欢他。

In the end, I think the best thing Asuka teaches him is to distrust people.
最后，我认为明日香教给他的最好的事情就是不信任人。
The poor boy was incredibly naive and gullible in the cannon and allowed himself to fall for all the deceptions and lies that all the adults in NERV told him. That easterner's betrayal is a hard lesson Shinji has to learn if he wants to stop people from stabbing him in the back.
这个可怜的男孩在大炮中非常天真和容易上当受骗，让自己陷入了 NERV 所有成年人告诉他的所有欺骗和谎言。那个东方人的背叛是真嗣必须吸取的惨痛教训，如果他想阻止人们在背后捅他一刀。

And it goes without saying that the fact that Shinji trains to be a pilot is a huge improvement on the canonical story.
不言而喻，真嗣训练成为一名飞行员这一事实是对经典故事的巨大改进。
Overall I like that they give military uniforms to the children, since clothes make the man and come on, the fact that they walked around the Geofront in school uniforms was an insult on the part of adults in charge.
总的来说，我喜欢他们给孩子们穿军装，因为衣服造就了男人，来吧，他们穿着校服在地理前线走来走去的事实对负责的成年人来说是一种侮辱。
“We give you adult responsibilities, but you wear the proof that we are not going to give you any adult privileges, you cannot decide anything or express your opinions, since you are in our charge like pets”.
“我们给你成年人的责任，但你戴着证据，证明我们不会给你任何成人特权，你不能决定任何事情或表达你的意见，因为你像宠物一样由我们负责”。

I also like how Misato is introduced. Unlike the other aloof adults she tried to put a cheerful front on a bleak situation and it made her worse.
我也喜欢美里的介绍方式。与其他冷漠的成年人不同，她试图在黯淡的处境中摆出一副开朗的样子，这让她变得更糟。
Asuka is right about you, your kindness and smiles are completely fake and you’re a lying slut.
明日香对你的看法是对的，你的善良和微笑完全是假的，你是一个撒谎的荡妇。
You stopped giving a fuck about Asuka pretty quickly once the poor child started to fall apart, right? If they hadn't found her half dead in the bathtub, you wouldn't have even remembered she existed so that you would throw her to the vultures in EoE.
一旦这个可怜的孩子开始分崩离析，你很快就不再在乎明日香了，对吧？如果他们没有在浴缸里发现她半死不活，你甚至不会记得她的存在，所以你会把她扔给 EoE 的秃鹫。
Drink until you get liver cancer and die very slowly, you blind bitch.
喝酒直到你得了肝癌，死得很慢，你这个瞎眼的婊子。

It honestly pisses me off the position of absolute inferiority that Anno put Shinji in in relation to Asuka. It got on my nerves watching her play with the helpless boy like a cat with a mouse. Here at least he was able to catch up with her by confronting her and defeating her in a few fights instead of becoming a battered wife.
老实说，庵野将真嗣置于与明日香相关的绝对劣势地位让我很生气。看着她像猫捉老鼠一样和这个无助的男孩玩耍，我感到很紧张。至少在这里，他能够通过与她对峙并在几场战斗中击败她来赶上她，而不是成为一个被殴打的妻子。

Above all I love that he stops being everyone's lapdog, stands up to lying and hypocritical adults and he stands up for himself, being a jerk if he likes it and not giving a shit if he doesn't fit in at school.
最重要的是，我喜欢他不再是每个人的走狗，而是挺身而出，面对撒谎和虚伪的成年人，他为自己挺身而出，如果他喜欢，他就是一个混蛋，如果他不适合学校，他就不会在乎。

It comforts me to see how Asuka has taught him self-respect and pride, to the point that he feels a legitimate feeling of grievance and rage when the redhead wins him in a fight. This is the male pride that he should have learned, instead of becoming a eunuch.
看到明日香如何教会他自尊和骄傲，我感到很欣慰，以至于当红发女郎在战斗中赢得他时，他感到一种合理的委屈和愤怒。这是他本该学的男性骄傲，而不是当太监。

And Asuka also benefits a lot from her early relationship with Shinji. She forms her first (and probably only) genuine bond with a kid her age.
而明日香也从她与真嗣的早期关系中受益匪浅。她与一个同龄的孩子建立了她的第一个（也可能是唯一一个）真正的纽带。

It sends shivers down my spine to see how Asuka acts as a kid, because she already exhibits the disturbing behavior that she will show as a teenager. She displays immense self-centeredness and a sense of entitlement that prevents her from taking any responsibility for her actions, neither thanking nor apologizing to anyone.
看到明日香小时候的行为让我脊背发凉，因为她已经表现出了她十几岁时会表现出的令人不安的行为。她表现出极大的自我中心和权利感，这使她无法为自己的行为承担任何责任，既不感谢也不向任何人道歉。

She socially acts by wearing a perfect and popular girl mask to hide her insecurities and refuses to interact with Shinji in public at school to avoid showing her genuine nature and losing popularity by seeing a "loser".
她在社交上戴着完美而受欢迎的女孩面具来掩饰自己的不安全感，并拒绝在学校的公共场合与真嗣互动，以避免表现出自己的真实本性并因看到“失败者”而失去人气。

Unlike Shinji, it was Asuka's individual attitude and not her parents' actions that was the main cause of the girl's unhappiness and misery.
与真嗣不同，明日香的个人态度而不是她父母的行为是女孩不幸和痛苦的主要原因。
What Langley did with Kyoko in the hospital was undoubtedly immoral, but her daughter's resentment and coldness were not the best response.
兰利在医院里对杏子的所作所为无疑是不道德的，但女儿的怨恨和冷漠并不是最好的回应。
I don't know if Langley and her lover were as nice as they were in this fic, but I'm pretty sure that any father who receives such rejection from his daughter will not be very eager to keep trying to connect with her.
我不知道兰利和她的情人是否像这部小说中那样好，但我敢肯定，任何被女儿拒绝的父亲都不会非常渴望继续尝试与她建立联系。
For better or worse, Asuka has to acknowledge that her family has given her a quality education and shelter, and she has to say thank you at the very least.
无论好坏，明日香都必须承认她的家人给了她优质的教育和庇护，她至少要说声谢谢。
She should only look at Shinji to realize how lucky she is and thank God, because if she had grown up in Japan with that shitty sensei she wouldn't have become the spitfire that she is now.
她应该只看着真嗣，意识到自己是多么幸运，感谢上帝，因为如果她在日本和那个糟糕的老师一起长大，她就不会成为现在的喷火。

The treatment that she gives her grandmother is cruel even if it is a facade, there is no justification for that.
她给祖母的待遇是残忍的，即使是门面，也没有任何道理。
Have you forgotten your christian teachings, Asuka? Doesn't Jesus teach to turn the other cheek and forgive, since that does good to the soul?
明日香，你忘记了你的基督教教义吗？耶稣不是教导要转过脸去饶恕，因为这对灵魂有好处吗？

Shinji isn't close to matching her intelligence in numbers, but he surpasses her in artistic talent. And I think Asuka would do well in life if she learned to stop and contemplate the beauty of the world instead of being immersed in a cacophony of noise and rush. Beauty will save the world, as Dostoevsky said.
真嗣在数量上与她的智力不相上下，但他在艺术天赋上超过了她。我认为，如果明日香学会停下来思考世界的美丽，而不是沉浸在喧嚣和匆忙的喧嚣中，那么她的生活会做得很好。正如陀思妥耶夫斯基所说，美丽将拯救世界。

But Shinji's greatest talent is undoubtedly his capacity for introspection and his common sense, areas in which Asuka is a complete dunce. Asuka undoubtedly did more foolish things than any other NGE character.
但真嗣最大的天赋无疑是他的内省能力和常识，而明日香在这些领域是一个彻头彻尾的笨蛋。明日香无疑比任何其他 NGE 角色都做了更多愚蠢的事情。

For example, she could have waited for the angels to be defeated before going to college, since her Eva training was the most immediate priority. She could have waited until she was 17 to start university with much less pressure and more opportunities to socialize with people her own age.
例如，她本可以等到天使被打败后再去上大学，因为她的伊娃训练是最紧迫的优先事项。她本可以等到17岁才开始上大学，压力要小得多，有更多的机会与同龄人交往。

That's why Shinji is so important here, he's the first person she doesn't act cold and distant around or act fake by faking smiles for the sake of her social life.
这就是为什么真嗣在这里如此重要的原因，他是第一个她不会为了社交生活而表现得冷漠疏远或假装微笑的人。
Shinji is vital to set limits for that girl and to tell her to her face that her behavior with people is immoral and cruel.
真嗣至关重要，要为那个女孩设定限制，并当面告诉她，她与人相处的行为是不道德和残忍的。

It's much easier for this pair to come together as childhood friends than teenagers in the canon, as they dragged through years of trauma and maldevelopment and were in the midst of hormonal seething, grim circumstances even if Misato hadn't been a callous and self-absorbed neglectful bitch.-
这对搭档作为儿时的朋友走到一起比经典中的青少年要容易得多，因为他们经历了多年的创伤和发育不良，处于荷尔蒙沸腾、严峻的环境中，即使美里不是一个冷酷无情、自我陶醉的忽视婊子。

It seems to me a good development that Shinji ends up distancing himself from Asuka in his preteens due to his inability to compete in qualifications with her, the pressure of his training as a soldier, his impending puberty and above of all, his character development due to his wider circle of people, which makes him become increasingly aware how awful Asuka acts and treats people.
在我看来，真嗣最终在十几岁时与明日香保持距离，因为他无法与她竞争资格赛，他作为士兵训练的压力，他即将到来的青春期，最重要的是，由于他更广泛的圈子，他的性格发展，这使他越来越意识到明日香的行为和对待人是多么糟糕。

And no doubt Asuka benefits in Japan from having a childhood friend waiting for her in that strange land. She could not fit in in any way in the closed and etiquette-obsessed Japanese society, so she has at least one comrade who is doing as badly as she is, although she (for now) manages to make up for this lack of manners with her foreign exotic student glamour.
毫无疑问，明日香在日本受益于有一个儿时的朋友在那片陌生的土地上等着她。她无法以任何方式融入封闭和痴迷于礼仪的日本社会，所以她至少有一个同志和她一样糟糕，尽管她（现在）设法用她的外国异国情调的学生魅力弥补了这种缺乏礼貌。

This is one of the most magnificent Asushin fics I have read and I have been relieved to see what could have been if Gendo had had some common sense and provided his son with the means to be a pilot and contact with his comrade the Second Child.
这是我读过的最宏伟的 Asushin 小说之一，我松了一口气，看看如果 Gendo 有一些常识并为他的儿子提供成为飞行员的手段并与他的战友 Second Child 联系，会发生什么。
Thank you! 谢谢！
